<h3>日本保守勢力的再抬頭</h3>
<p>日本保守新黨運動，以前任首相即自由黨總裁吉田茂與緣風會會長松平恒雄為中心，至九月初復加人民主黨名譽織裁幣　　重　，參戰院外交委員畏佐權尙武，以及參議院若干議員，現正　極活動，期於和會召麒前軍掌政權。這是一個值得重視的問題。如果保守新黨結合成立，牠不但可能推倒片山內閣，要使日本政治倒退，並且對未來和會將發生重大影饗，而波　坦宣言「成立一傾向和平民主及負責之政府」的目的，也必將成爲可望而不可即了。</p>
<p>戰後日本保守勢力，包括財團，資本家，地主，及官僚，雖一時感受若干民主改革的打擊，戰爭罪行整禍的威協，一時會潛伏着不敢抬頭，但到來帥雷厲恥仃的改革且夕消逝以後，潛伏中的保守勢力又復活躍，送常然是美國管理政策的柔和寬大。去年十月，自由進步）兩黨中間，有人提出「案中國結，保守力量」口號，終以時機术成熟，未能成功。最近因美蘇關係尖銳對立，對日和約問題又意見分歧，而在另一方面社會黨又採取反資本家態度嗎，以經濟力　中排除法與炭　國有，推行溫和社會改革，引起了資本家地主的攻擊，於是保守勢力認為有機可乘，遂進行此大結合運動。吉田乃舊時代的典型官僚，自由黨大野幹事長，星島總務會長，久爲保守派中堅，當社會黨執政時，即與代表民主黨幣原系之田中副職長秘密結合，聯絡松平等頑固派，作次一步政治活動之準備。松平恒雄乃裕仁弟秩父宮的岳丈，舊時代之重臣，現任參戰院織長，其領導之「絲風會」，除以松平爲言腦外，佐藤尚武，來馬琢道，野田後作等均為中堅，彼等以官僚姿態，代表資本家地主利益，並以綠風號召人民盲信天皇制；現在與幣原喜車郎站立同一戰綫，實力雄厚，有背景，有奧援，以和會親美外交為烟幕，以保護舊勢力反社會改革為政策。牠所以長成，所以活躍，無疑是日本政治黑暗與反動的表微，也是美國管理政策的縱容與姑息的結果。</p>
<p>片山面對保守新黨力量的發展，左右為難；他一方面表示政府有能力應付和會，另方面堅決實施社會改革，以圖挽救當前經濟　關，進而穩定其政權。九月廿九日閣會，通過「經濟力集中排除法案」·內容包括三要點：　限制個人的財富：　限制因協定契約而產生的經濟集中；　限制企業生產力及經營的集中。這是奉行盟總命令解散財閥必行的步驟，但財閥堅決反對，保守新黨運動更意　釜底抽薪，根本推到片山政權，而另定國策。接著十月三日閣會又通過「煤炭增產其體方案」，該方案內容有六點：　煤礦業勞動者由廿四小時三交替制，實施工作四日休息一日之週五日制；　對勞動者增產增加收入之納稅額，不採累進稅而減免之；　就業規則由勞動團體自動決定；　爲和平而迅速解決勞資爭議，創設「煤炭生產協議會；」　改善煤礦技術，優先配給資材；　由開發新煤礦而停止黑市交易，以謀消極增產。這個煤礦國家管理辦法，目的在增產與消威罷工，仍係舉行盟總命令而定的。依商工省計劃，日木煤炭至一九五二年可產增至四千萬噸·每年增產二三百萬噸。英國工黨政府成立之初，第一個法案在國會通過的，也就是煤礦的國家管理，現在的日本國會，阻力大，暗礁多，穩健的社會改革能否得到國會協護和支持，當難判斷。如不幸而遭阻礙，必大减社會黨的威望。那時，片山知難而退呢？還是投向保守勢力的懷抱？這將成為日本「政治民主」「經濟民主」前途的考驗。</p>
<p>由於保守新　運動的發展，以及日本經濟危機的深入，片山環境困難多了。加以片山頭上的「太上天皇」，對日本民主的途欠堅定，對解散財閥無決心，而三黨聯合政府的民主黨蘆田均又一派　　，左右逢源，片山早已陷於孤掌難鳴的境地。九月份出版的「金鋼鑽」權咸雜誌，社論「片山內閣之危機」，指出經濟危機無法克服，必逍「十月危機」無疑，但內閣書記長西尾答　說：「片山內閣決不在十一月間考盛改組」，並堅決相信：「兩大法案得不到支持，片山仍不致臻臺台，將支持至對日和約召開以後」。社　黨如此自信，是以什麼作依據，我們很難知道。事寶上，即使片山內閣瓦解，日本經濟危機更難見服的。幣原·吉田的無能，巳經在戰後經過試驗，所以「金剛　」難誌也說：「片山內閣如很却了，危機並不能因片山之破迫而解決，即令其他內閣，亦不可避免。」為什麼呢？這因為美國管理政策有錯誤，日本政治民主和經濟民主的距離都很遼遠，而財閥末解散，資本仍集中，戰犯未懲罰，經濟仍儒在，全日本的和平民眾仍在苦難中！</p>
<h3>調和美蘇意見的中國建議</h3>
<p>聯合國第二屆大會自開幕迄今，忽已滿月；但是在這三十天內，祇見成功湖上波瀾迭起，業已列入議程中的若干間題，雖均提交各種委員會討論，但都沒有獲得任何協議；而共中最重要且最惹人注意的，莫過於美國代表所提出的建議，主張組織一個五十七國常務委員會，終年經常開會，以維持世界的和平與安全。日來聯合國大會政治委員會正在討論這一個問題，蘇聯代表堅決表示異議，認為美國提出遵個建議的勳機，乃在規避安全理事會，使常任理事國不能行使否決權。因此這個問題不僅成為美蘇兩國代表在聯合國大會內發生爭執的焦點，而且也成為此次聯合國大會所面臨的最大障礙：所以世界谷國對於政治委員會討論此一問題，莫不予以密切的注視。</p>
<p>我國代表顧維鈞博士對此，為調和美蘇雙方的意見起見，特別提出一個折衷至當的辦法。據合眾社的報道，頭代表巳於十五日在政治委員會席上，表示中國有條件的贊成美國建議，並認為五十七國常務委員會，如其職權能作明確的規定，一方面不担任聯合國大會所負的主要任務：另一方面又不侵犯安全理事會維持世界和平的任務；則該委員會將為聯合國大會有用的輔助機關。至其所提出的條件則有二端：　凡勝於聯合國憲章第十一條及第十四條範圍內之任何國際問題及局勢，須提交下屆聯合國大會討論者，始能由五十七國常務委員會代替答聯合國大會，作一預先之研究及調杳。　實施聯合國大會所通過之決議，但任何問題正由五十七國常務委員會討論及研究者，亦不能禁止任何會員國將此一問題訴諸安全理事會，一經安全理事會處理之後，該當務委員會即須停止討論。</p>
<p>我國代表的折衷方案，若能為聯合國大會接受，則職合國所這過的困難，自能迎刃而解。緣美國所以要提出這個建議，乃因聯合國機構受否決權的阻礙，對於戰後所發生的國際問題，均未能作有效的解決；美國為爭取聯合國的成功起見，馬　爾國務卿——在聯合國大會開幕時致詞，就主張嚴格限制否決權的行使，並正式向大會建議，設立五十七國常務委員會，終年輕當開會，專事研究關於世界和平與安全的問題。但是在馬歐爾國務卿發表這個建籬之後，立即引起蘇聯代表的堅決反對，蘇聯外次維辛斯基乃在聯合國大會發表演說，猛烈抨擊美于國的建議，並指斥美國的目的，乃在規避安全理事會，使常任理事國不能行使否決機，故此項議徒有利於「戰爭販子」云云。美蘇對於這一個問題所發生的爭論，若無法調處使雙方成立妥協，則將來的結果，不論那一方而的主張獲勝，均足以危及聯合國機構的存在。</p>
<p>當美蘇兩國代表爭論最烈的時候，外界就盛傳着蘇聯有退出聯合國機橋的可能，就是英國前任首相邱吉爾，至今也謎為蘇聯將有得此舉，非不可能！邱為於十四日發表廣播演說，即以此為言，並謂：「世界若希望和平，蘇聯雖退出聯合國，但戰爭亦不致發生」。何况新共產國際業已出現，蘇聯即可利用這個國際組織，從事反美活動及宣傳。所以我們爲避免蘇聯退出聯合國致使世界分裂為二起見，美國對於這一個問題，應該作相當的讓步，自下寺雪。旦是在另一角度看來，聯合國機　迄未能成爲有效的國際機構，理應設法挽教；平心而論，美國的建議也不失為方案之一，如因蘇聯反對而予以放棄，則聯合國關構的基礎仍建立在五強一至日原具上，對於戰後所發生的國際問題，仍不能作有效的解決，結果所屆，聯合國機稱各有實亡，仍不免蹈舊國際聯盟的覆轍。所以凡是愛好世界和平的國家，凡是以擁護聯合國機構為國策的國家，均應該設法調和美蘇兩國的意見，成立折衷方案，俾偵聯合國機構不致有各無實。</p>
<p>要之，聯合國機構在美蘇面突的來縫裏，已到了生死存亡的最後關頭，刻正在成功湖畔出席大會的各國代表，均應運用其政治智　，打開目前的僵局，而爲獲一條出路：我國代表顧維　博士的折衷方案，是值得各國注意的。我們更希望美蘇兩國的代表，切勿意氣用事，而能平心靜氣，仔細研究一下我國代表的折衷方案，並爲顧全世界的大局起見，尤應早作賢明的抉擇！</p>

<p>朝鮮代表談話</p>
<p>記者於十六日午赴西冷飯店，走訪出席大會之朝鮮代表金夫人，詢以在日本統治時之掙扎經過，渠稱：過去種秿殘酷與慘痛之遭遇，實不勝述，總之人民絕對無絲亳自山，靑年會係社會宗教工作，故受到嚴屬之監視，至一九三九年即被迫解散，一切活動完全停幀，地下工作同志被殺害者不知儿幾。金夫人原在朝鮮高級學院任宗教教授，後以宗教科日被迫取消而　業，勝利以後，即專組靑年會，展閒活動，惟蘇聯控制下之北部，國際性之宗教活動仍被禁止，現韓國南北兩部完全隔絕，信件來往亦受檢查，家人不得團緊者，仍比比皆然，故國人無不渴望和平統一平日來臨。</p>
<p>婦女地位提高</p>
<p>據金夫人稱：戰後朝鮮婦女之地位，巳普遍提高，現時結婚婦女出外任職者甚多，丈夫不得千涉，政府機構巾並特設部門，專門討論婦女福利事工之進行，本年年底，韓國將舉行萬屆大選，婦女亦有選舉櫳，與男一律平等</p>
<h3>侵吞台灣黃金案</h3>
<p>（上接一版）按一九四五年十月間，艾文思中校任美軍聯絡組長，隨同我派遣之前進指揮所抵台北，彼乃利用職權，自日軍少佐原田佐處接收「福」字金元入箱，共計四千枚，每枚重一兩，但僅以二千枚（即二千兩）送交台省長官公署，而將另外二千枚（即二千兩）慶香，原田佐係日軍經理處之軍官，當時尚有充任翻譯員之台　靑年黃在榮知悉此事，艾文思嗣由黃在榮之介紹，結識在滬經商之乃弟黃在義，並於同年十一月間，分批私將金元倫運上海出魯，共計售出一千九百廿一兩，換得　金十萬七千九百六十七元，黃在義分得佣金美金七百零六元及法留四十六萬六千元，另有金元七十九兩，下落不明，傳彼艾文思帶返美國。此案於去年發覺時，返抵美國之艾文思已退伍，旋被狗捕，美國方面並於今年春間開庭偵查、台省公署曾派官員伍宋恭，夏之　及馬咸三人飛赴洛杉體作證，黃在義及日人原田佐與另一舉案有關之美軍上尉愛隆生（Capt.　Arouson），亦會出庭，旋即提起公訴。</p>
<h3>蔣夢麟氏在滬談話</h3>
<p>（上接一版）本屆大會逮東國家除印尼，安南，日本二國外，其餘各國均有代表出席，會問劉各國工業，經濟，文化，教資，民主主義等問題，均曾廣泛交換意見。對於日本問題，各國代表成感再教育工作之專娑，對於我國國內政治，則未予討　，大會因限於交換意見，并無決議，故一切意見記錄後，僅供各國參考，蔣氏謂：留英期間，考察英國壯會之各方面，深感英國今日之經濟悄况實至　重，目前英國至少有一千萬人，其食物必需仰賴國外輸入，市塲上猪肉極為少見，瑞蛋竞告絕跡，因此，英國政府對物資之統制，較戰時尤為發厲。一方面人民所需，均受配給，國王，首相亦無例外。另一方面，所有物資，政府强制必須出售，以防國積，余友家中養猪，欲求自食竟不獲准，所生雞蛋，亦必須在市塲公開出售，惟英國物資雖枸缺乏，但無黑市存在，此釐英人習於守法，寗願個人忍受困苦，不願增加國家之危難，此種精神，值得吾人之　敬與學習。蔣氏最後否認渠將出任粵省秘書長之傳說。</p>
<h3>金壁輝一味狡賴</h3>
<p>（上接一版）十六日一監佈置臨時法庭，因事前報上未宣佈地點，故旁聽者少，何市畏亦來觀響。審判長吳盛酒，檢察官賈策全等，下午一時半升庭。金於水銀　下着灰囚衣步入，先向其三辯護人鞠躬，後答庭上問，自稱册三歲，日本國籍北平人。</p>
<p>歷述罪狀</p>
<p>檢察官歷述罪狀，謂被告生於中國，國籍無問題，因其為遜淸後人，而有恢復滿淸思想，被告具有作問諜之各種　件，如駕飛　汽車，騎馬，游泳，跳舞，攝影·並　英·法·中·日語言，且册餘歲猶未結婚，而往來於日百要之問，可知其有問諜行為，惟因其技術高超，乃難　證據，此亦其一口否認原因，本案注意點，應為被告曾企圖將偽滿傳儀　熱河，更圖組「定國軍」，雖　計日方，將華南交汪精衛，將華北交朱深，考諸被告在北平行轉督察處自白書，可證實其漢奸罪。</p>
<p>辯辭弊利</p>
<p>其後庭上即遂項審間，或令其陳述，金對自白書各點，殆皆否認，謂係受騙奉命寫給李宗仁的「小說」，並再三說：「這樣的槍總我可以，但是除却漢奸罪，在國父遺像前，我敢說沒作對不起中國的事」。又稱：十六歲回中國，是因知道了是中國人，來看祖國，調：「國父也望中日親善的，說我是漢奸，請拿證據來。」金辮才頗高，看似天眞，實則語甚鋒利，亳不漏空。金稱：「日木人想利用我，但我未被利用，這不犯罪呀！」</p>
<p>一切否認</p>
<p>金否認曾在滬當舞女，作間諜，否認有復滿組「定國軍」企圖，以及對馬占山蘇炳文策反，謂乃其兄　東所為。叉謂從未參與偽滿事，前謂寺垣曾以手槍迫本莊繁出兵，乃自日文書上知道。對在日曾訪汪精衛，問其與蔣主　有無聯絡事，謂該時並未在日。曾受槍傷，乃為恐日炸故宮，向近衛求悄，一怒自打者。着大將軍服，謂為片刻好奇，以後不穿成嗎。</p>
<p>目無法官</p>
<p>最後謂：「官司沒法打，我沒錢了，不能給法官電錢，再有事變，我必定同　官一起跑」。綢之三辯護人辯護，請庭上注意證據；與金之起訴書多想像之詞，應不因金之神秘戲劇性面認作犯罪證據。臨退庭前，金尚問檢察官「你貴姓」謂：希望以後處理別的案子改改罷。</p>
<h3>政黨提名候選名額問題擱淺　監院討論監委選舉問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕三黨提名參加大選之名額分配問題，尚未獲致協議。民社黨堅持在名額問題未解決前，不提出名單。靑年黨雖已提出國大代表之候選人名單，但立委候選人則迄未提出。國民黨中央選舉指導委會十六日開會時，曾對政黨提名及審查黨員參加競選之原則等問題，詳加討諭。據今自滬返京之民社黨蔣勻田談稱，該黨中常會所決定之名額實為「最小」之數字，而此項數字之標準，乃係就目前國內環境，衡量該黨內部可以拿出如許人數，足以担任代表或立委之職務者。記者詢以此項名額是否絕對不可變更，渠答稱，當視雙方（指國民黨與民社黨）相讓之程度如何。靑年黨余家菊告記者稱，所謂候選人名額並非當選人名額。憲法規定須有三分之二人數始可修改，吾人希望靑年民社兩黨及無黨派人士至少有出分之一之人數。</p>

<p>謠當是非常之多的，不知從何而來，偶不小心，便會彼其榮蔽。事實上，國軍進烟台時未放一槍一砲，戰鬥早在　山，水滿頭兩　（烟台的外關）結束，所以市區沒有　到砲火的洗禮，否則決非如今的面目。到烟台就會令人回憶到禇玉璞，劉珍年，張宗昌，韓復渠幾代軍閥。一個烟台中年人，自小學時代迄今，耳畔從未斷過槍聲。烟台建築完好，大街小巷，一律是水泥路面，是劉珍年時代的遺物。可是港口却不高明，船舶沒有碼頭可靠，必須用小總板擺駁。山東籍企業家曾經一度企圖修築煙維鐵路，俾使煙台的地位代替靑島，結果是遭受日本帝國主義者的阻止。事實上，烟台的商港價值遠在靑島之上。在水逍運輸上，對渤海各港都近，對南方的直接聯　，僅比靑島多十個小時，最甫要的區別，是烟台有物產，而靑島沒有。烟台物產包括水菜，花邊，髮綱，豬陽，菓酒五大宗。吸收外匯，佔全國重要比數。水藥中的　榮，梨子，葡萄，秋季正是上市的時候。年來因爲沒有輪出，果聯砍去不少。果圖的規模令人想到美國西部，煙台開港僅數十年，遭塊開闢的士地，每一個五十歲左右的烟台人都目擊一棟一棟房屋蓋起來，一片一片果園繁頒起來的，現在烟台雖然匱乏困苦，但到處仍　漫着頻果的香氣。小販肩挑首在街上喊前「十五個子兒一斤」，這就是木地人已不屑一顧，面南方認爲珍品的東西。</p>
<p>「三朝元老」依然做會長</p>
<p>在烟台，不乏「三朝元老」。例如：藩名的張裕酒廠，日產備萄酒，白蘭地一百至二百箱，這位張老　的父親張裕原是工人出身，但傳及兄子手裹，便成了完全的資本家。張裕酒廠十年來從朱停工，現在老　是跑掉了，機器還仕，亳未損壞，市府遂封為公產。另一位是商會會長，現在依然做會長，協助市府恢復秩序。現在港口還在海軍管理之下，駕期內當可恢復正常狀態。過去烟台港曾經是外國艦隊避暑的所在，商人們不免　憬於十餘年前的「繁榮」，他們一見美國水兵上岸，便很快寫出英文照牌，便計劃酒吧和舞塲。據海軍方面對我說二導次這艘美國巡洋艦，並未允許入港，僅允許他們上岸遊覽的謂求，他們艦上放假三天，由中國海東陪同巡遊烟市。現在不知道以後是否能自由出入。</p>
<p>市長丁綍庭貌如馮玉祥</p>
<p>最後，我將介紹現任市長丁綍庭，山東牟平人，五十一歲，貌如馮玉祥，體格　偉則遜之。畢業於東北講武堂及東北警告，曾任　察綏靖處參調，參加長城抗戰，那時任旅長，在喜峯口指揮作戰，被敵軍包闊過一次。抗戰時在塲東打遊擊，正和靑島市長李先良一樣，被人忘卻其原有的學歷和履歷，而喜稱為「打又擊出身」（十一日發自烟臺）（完）</p>
<p>靑美領館官員稱揚國軍紀律</p>
<p>〔聯合社靑島十六日電〕美國領事官員近由煙台視察回來，據其告聯合社記者稱：國軍收復煙台後兩週，當地情形已迅速恢復常狀。國軍第二十五師於十月一日最先入城，士氣旺盛，紀律極佳，購物依值付　，故人民　　歡迎，並竭誠協助建築防禦工事。煙台美國財產，如美孚公司油　及教士主宅等，受損甚巨，但非由於戰事，而因宵小重機劫掠，拆去所有木料。美領事館之　案完好無恙，已攜回靑島。煙台領館尚未計劃恢復。據某華商告美教士稱：我人在共產黨治下如居黑暗中，今已重見天日。華人對共黨統治者之感情，由此可以概見一斑。</p>

<h3>歐州危機影響美國安全　馬歇爾力促援歐　要求立即採取緊急措施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播:華盛頓訊，杜魯門總統今日在記者招待會上宣稱，政府方面對於以臨時援助給予法國一點雖已獲致相當成就，但召開國會特會以謀協助歐洲解決今冬之經濟危機，或仍屬盡要。目下渠正竭力設法獲羅歡項援助歐洲，以免召開國會特會之種種麻煩。數星期來，杜魯門之語調以今日比較最樂觀。渠並謂內長克魯格調查國內資源以謀大規樓援　之報告，日內即可發表。關於美國接收德國英軍區之議，杜任稱目下尚無所決定。有　總統對華萊士批評言論有何意見，渠拒不作答。</p>
<p>〔路透社波斯頓十五日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日在此向美國產業職工大會發表演說，力言在美國國會得就長期援歐計劃採取行動以前，有由美國從事救急援助，以防歐洲崩潰之需要。馬卿曰；吾人已面臨我政府及生活方式所據之西方文明特點將告消失之危險。吾人必須採用積極的過渡措施，俾在國會得有充分之時間以考虛並就長期援助計劃行動以前，防止歐洲政治經濟及心理上的致命惡化。目前以節糧計劃，乃此　過渡措施之一。定於十一月開會之國會委員會，無疑的將考慮其他措施。同時，美國政府亦當盡其所能，供給援助。惟此不過為防止今冬崩潰之一重要步驟而已。馬卿繼概述在目前世界局勢下，美國外交政策之基本原則，謂「今日之基本問題乃為是否允許人頗有依其志願，自由組織其社會，政治，及經濟生存之權，或彼等之生活是否將聽任極少數人之支配。當今之世，此一問題之嚴重性，已超過前此之程度。藉口壓制甚至消滅人類自由之理論，雖因時代而不同，然此等理論均具有一最重大的謬論，即在人類之事務中，可不擇手段以完成其目標。一馬卿繼又述及六月問渠在哈佛大學初報援助　議後「馬歇爾援歐計劃」之歷史。並曰:吾人今已達到歐洲十六國業巳提出初步報告之階段。國會若干委員會計劃於數星期內召開會議，審查其有即時性需要之首要措施，然後即將由政府提出援助歐洲長期復與之計劃。不論此一計劃之形式如何，吾人可以確信各參與國家之將從事每一可能的努力，以完成其自定之生產目標及財政改革。此等國家，均需要極度之堅忍。就基本上言，當前之仳界復與問題，實為一生產問題。我美國人民應知：增加生產需要更勤奮之工作，而後者復需要糧食。美國農村及工廠之生產，對於全世界均具有極度重大之影響。美國今處於世界極度危急之危機之中，此一局勢蘊藏至大的危險。每一美國人民應均認淸，凡以為美國得在危機中電獨保持超然地位者，實乃愚者之見。歐洲之經濟安定，乃其政治安定之必要條件。因此，對於我美國之和平及安全，以至整個世界之和平與安全，均具極度重大之影響。吾人正面臨西方文明特性將遭消滅之危險，而我政府及生活方式，固均以此一西方文明之特性為根據云。</p>
<h3>外人在美資產十億元　美政府考慮徵用　擬以此供緊急援歐之需</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十五日電〕據美代理國務卿洛維特今日稱馬歇爾計劃將於十一月十日芷式提交國會委會決定。洛氏强調美國在目前情况下，己竭最大努力，使歐洲國家，渡過本年冬季。</p>
<p>法義在美可以動用之財產，不足應付其美元恐慌。隊估計，協助此等國家渡過冬季至明年三月底所需款項，將較杜魯門總統所提五億八千五百萬元臨時協助之數字多一億元或二億元。洛氏繼稱:美政府正研究徴用外人在美資產，以協助拨歐計劃之法津問題。關於此點，國務院尚未要求私人銀行公佈外人有款之數字。至是否正計劃採取此種步驟，渠不願答覆。法國已要求各有關之政府機構研究其國民在美之財產。據傳司法部正研究微用歐洲人民在美貸產，以支持進出口銀行所發公債之法律問題。眾認由外僑資產管理局控制下，約近十億美元之外僑財產，支持進出口銀行所發公債，乃合法之措施。</p>
<h3>德船卅一艘　美將讓予法國</h3>
<p>皮杜爾對援歐計劃樂觀</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：美國為支持受共產黨脅迫之法國政府，刻正設法予以經濟上及物實上之擾助。據懸，美國擬以獲自德國海軍方面之船隻三十一艘，讓予法國，藉以改善法國之海運工作。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕據悉：皮社爾在今日之閣議中，巳向其閣僚保證，美國允諸給予法國之臨時援助，已足供法國維持至馬歇爾計劃實現之時。</p>
<h3>緊急援歐計畫英國不在其列</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫数十五日電〕政府負責人士稱：解凍美金借款剩餘部份成確保馬歇爾計劃於明年六月以前實施，均不能阻止英國繼績切實削减其以美金購貨及加緊减縮其對美金交易區域之購買。英國在馬歇爾計劃討論前，不能要求臨時援助。</p>
<h3>西歐各國需援數字龐大　美要求再予削減　勢將引起微妙外交問題</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十五日電〕籌劃馬歇爾計劃之高級國務院官員稱，彼等相信參預該計劃之歐洲各國，恐非减少彼等之要求至美國會認為「合理」不可，否則美政府將不得不代為削弱。彼等稱；唯一之問題厥為削减之工作由何人擔任。此舉有涉微妙之外交及政治問題，蓋歐洲十六國會議執委會刻正訪問美國，渠等曾稱，如由彼等負實削臧數字，則將無法達到所希望之復興程序，而失敗之責，亦將由彼等擔員。</p>
<p>政府中消息靈通人士則私人談稱，馬歇爾計劃提出國會時，將彼劇烈削减。美國高級官員稱，彼等不敢將此態度李直告知歐洲首席代表弗如克斯爵士及其同僚，以免彼等失望之餘，進行回國。然美國及歐洲一致認為不必朮開巴黎倫會議，而在現下之會議中究成必要之改正，楚方均認為將計劃送回歐洲重行討論，不啻乃其喪鐘。</p>
<h3>華萊士痛斥美政府大員　指為垣街牽綫人</h3>

<h3>阿拉伯集團七國家　訂軍事互助公約　要求代管義屬領里比亞</h3>
<p>〔路透社貝魯特十五日電〕阿拉伯聯盟理專會在黎巴嫩外交部召開秘密會議八天，業已演告結束，會後各阿拉伯國重申根據互助及自衛之原則，從事軍事合作之決心。聯盟秘書長阿柴姆聲稱，阿拉伯國可成立之軍事公約，乃聯盟於一九四四年成立以來最偉大的成就，軍事合作之被承認為阿拉伯世界之基本因素，在中東尚屬初次。</p>
<p>埃及·伊拉克·敘利亞·黎巴　最近辭職之美專管財政專嫩·外約但·沙地阿刺伯·葉門等七國破天荒成立軍事合作協定，實以巴勒斯坦問題為其動機。阿柴姆復透露：在今日之聯盟會中，已草具致英美蘇法四强之備忘錄，要求准許阿拉伯國參加定於下月討論北非里比亞問題之國際委員會，若阿拉伯國被選治理託管下之里比亞；埃及最可能當選。</p>
<h3>克萊頓去職原因與馬卿意見不合</h3>
<p>〔路遠社倫敦十五日電〕此間觀察家相信，美經濟事務副國務卿克萊頓之辭職，係因與馬歇爾國務卿就帝國貿易優惠制意見不同之故。克氏堅持英國必須以放棄其帝國貿易優惠制，為參加馬歇爾歐洲復興計劃之條件，而馬卿則認歐洲之復興，不能僅因對於貿易優惠制度主義上的抨擊而受妨碍。苞以不使英國參加援歐計劃為要挾，而要求英國廠聚其帝國貿易優惠制，在政治上將不免為一惡劣之姿態，與歐洲復興及美國之主義均難吻合。據華盛頓報告稱，當英美關稅談判於上週進入嚴重階段時，項駐美大使殷佛却貝爾　爵即越過克萊頓而直接向馬歇爾接洽，此次晤談為英美關稅談判轉機之關鍵，亦為克萊頓去戰原因之一。</p>

<p>據吳分局長稱：水上分局之工作，可分為兩部，一為協助海關緝私，二為維特水上治安。關於緝私工作，警局僅居協助地位，凡海關人員鞭長莫及之處由水上警察隨時隨地予以一臂之助。就維持治安而言，自吳分局長就任以還，已大有進步。水老鼠已絕跡，而黃牛黨，亦因施行新制度，而一籌莫展。</p>
<p>水上分局現有員警共四百人，一均為訓練有案之優秀人材。配備一方面，亦已增强，除武裝巡船約五十艘外）包括舢　），並具有新式無綫電設備，管轄地區長一百五十里，寬一百里，目前治安，絕無問題。</p>

<h3>筱丹桂一棺附身　戲迷五萬擠破樂園爭看名伶最後一面</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕越劇名伶筱丹桂潰體，昨在樂園殯儀館入殮。大西路上，一變平日幽靜消寂之狀態，晨八時起市人前往樂園者，絡繹不絕。至午後愈聚愈多，由江蘇路口迄靈堂以內，擁塞不堪，造成阮玲玉以後十餘年來未有之「盛况」。午後袁雪芬，竺水招，徐玉蘭，傳全香等相偕入塲主持時，羣眾更爭先恐後，肩摩踵接，紛紛擁進靈堂，咸欲爭觀名伶顏色，兼瞻遺容。結果秩序大亂，紸木傢俱，草坪花不，盡被衝倒。花圈花籃，及筱伶巨幅照片架，亦踐踏為片片碎屑。軍警當局臨時派來大批人員協助維持，殮禮遂於一片嘈嚷聲中忽促進行。</p>
<p>殮禮進行前筱伶遺因來沙爾毒發，口邊曾稍有潰腐，故又重加化裝，靈前原供有「張門錢氏」神主，後因袁尊芬等之與議，將其撤去。筱伶之兄妹及其夫張春帆大婦之子女，盤筱伶之寄母多人，均在塲照料。筱伶身着各色衣衾計七件，各色褲計四條，白色長統機，績花鞋。入棺前並以筱伶生前用之旗袍二十五件，貼身衫褲馬甲等十餘件，純銀碗筷杯匙全套，絲棉被二條，　協其身旁作為殉葬。三時四十分蓋棺，當司儀高呼舉哀時，羣眾鵠候窗外，焦急不耐，遂排閣直入，六扇玻璃長窗，俱彼湧倒，靈台亦告壓坍，一時燭台委地，哭聲大發，鼓樂齊嗚，婦人驚呌有人輕薄，軍警捉得扒手多名。</p>
<p>殮禮進行中，筱伶之夫張春帆，亦身穿孝服出現，哭聲甚哀。其他越劇迷亦多嚎啕抽咽者，並面面互詢：「以後皇后（指山河戀一劇）不知道有誰能够扮演？」紛亂中另有一十五六歲之少女，在人潮汹湧前對堵拒之人負稱：「求你放我」進去看看，這是最後一次了！」哭泣哀求，堅欲入內，越劇之吸引大眾力量有如是。</p>
<p>此次殮禮中，樂園損失共達一億元以上。筏伶衾枕被褥所費計三千餘萬元，楠木棺一具一億五千萬元，飾終可稱當麗。至於何日舉殯，是否卜繪西湖，現尚待筱冷寄母專與越劇界會商決定。筱伶目殺眞相，聞俟各方交涉後即可發表。</p>
<p>昨去樂園之觀眾，據統計當在五萬人以上，其中幾全為婦女幼童。彼等直至袁雪芬等在軍警保護下突破重圍後，於五時左有始陸績離去。</p>

<p>胡適博士　（本報攝）</p>
<h3>胡適一席談　南京十四日訊　本報記者濮德玠</h3>
<p>胡適博士（本報攝）「……學生決定今晨復課了」！</p>
<p>胡適校長說這句話時，充滿着偷快的情調。他用手推了推眼鏡架，珍惜地把一份報紙又折起來援在手里，告訴記者；</p>
<p>「這消息够好了吧？哈哈」—這「够好」的消息使胡校長顯得特別高興，在百忙中講了不少話。</p>
<p>「北大被捕的學生里還有兩名沒釋放，據官方公佈的案情相當嚴事。兩個都是經濟系的學生，平時成績不錯，不過我都不認識，是離校很久，到勝利後方纔阿來復學的」。</p>
<p>談到北方學校師生的生活，他說：</p>
<p>「我來到這兒，看到能吃白米飯，眞是感到羨慕。北方情形太苦了，大家吃雜糧，米都是碎米，壞的很，同學們的主食是棒子糝，高梁麵，一天啃窩窩頭。我這回到南京離前一次不過一個月多點，可是物價漲的太多了，北方受到影饗，一般的生活會更苦的」。他邊說邊搖頭，驗上的笑容不見了，教職員學生的生活問題，是當前大學校長底新課題，牢牢地壓迫蕭學者們。他希望公教人員的待遇足以維持生活，立法院，監察院和參政會底新建議是合理的，應該實行。——但在記者與他談話的同時，政務會議已通過。過渡時期的調整辦法。</p>
<p>明年的美國大選</p>
<p>對於在中美與論界都激起了廣泛注意的蒲立德底「訪華觀感」，他正在找一份全文讀。他說浦氏是個爽快人，他們熟識，但對他文章里說的話，得等他看過後才好表示意見。從這里，記者和胡校長談起了美國的大選。</p>
<p>「明年的大選局勢，現在還看不出究竟傾向如何，這要等明年六月共和然總統候選人提名出來，七月星民主黨也決定了對抗的角色以後，才能觀測。共和黨已經四屆競選失敗了，而一九四四年杜威和羅斯福的藥子相差並不過多，所以明年是要有一番競爭的」。</p>
<p>史達希望頂大</p>
<p>「胡先生看共和黨里，誰有希望彼提各作候選人呢？」</p>
<p>「道很難說了，杜威在黨內組織方面是具有實力的，不過，一個曾經失敗過的人是很少再會被推選為候選人的，除非眞是人才缺乏，像布萊安在一八九六年·一九〇〇年·一九○八年曾三次被民主黨提名作候選人，但也接運三次失敗。艾森豪　爾是有為望的一個，但是還要等他脫離軍籍以後，明年他要作我們的校長了，（艾氏將就任時倫比亞大學校長），也許他會參加競選。還有，就是年靑幹練的史達森，今年不過四十歲，他最早開始競選，他的才識與主張，很得美國人民的愛戴，我看他的希望頂大。」</p>
<p>他認為麥帥老了</p>
<p>「麥克阿瑟將軍呢？」</p>
<p>「老了！」</p>
<p>「范登堡呢？」</p>
<p>「對了，密西根支持他，也是比較有希望的一個。」</p>
<p>「塔虎脫呢？」</p>
<p>「塔虎脫在共和黨里的勢力不小，不過他底孤立主義對他的競選很不利，美國人民已對這失去了與趣。」</p>
<p>對華萊士的看法</p>
<p>「胡先生看華萊士的第三黨怎樣？」</p>
<p>「華萊士的一派美國很進步的和自由主義的人們底擁護，但這終究是少數人，我底判斷，如果民主黨分裂了，必然促成共和黨底勝利。自一九一二年老羅斯福脫離共和黨另組進步黨招致失敗後，三十多年來沒有人再如此作過；那次雖然進步黨的票子比共和黨多，勝利却還是属於民主黨底威爾　，老羅斯福和老塔虎脫是兩敗俱傷了。」</p>
<p>外交不會有變化</p>
<p>「胡先生看明年美國大選的競爭，重心是在那里呢？如今，民主共和兩黨在外交上是一致的，到時候會不會有變更呢？」</p>
<p>「美國的外交，目前　看不出有安變的模樣，人民選擇的着眼點怕還是與他有切身利書的制度和主義。」</p>
<p>「胡先生的意思是說：明年的大選不致於影響美國的外交政策？」</p>
<p>他點點頭。最後說:「明年夏天看吧！」</p>
<p>胡校長侃侃的談話，因為時間關係，到此為止。在這說話不為的日干里，艱困的北方人民生活和太平洋彼岸的家務，似乎是他僅僅願意惕論的話題，中午還省一頓能吃白米飯的盛饌等着他，記者也就不便多打擾他了。</p>

<h3>敎育部督學陳東原談大學開支問題中大月需廿九億餘便大月需七億餘</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕教部因本月十一日滬大公報載蔡尙思論文，謂「一師兵每月的開支便是十二萬萬元，而辦一座大學，每月的預算只有三千多萬，養一師兵的費用可以維持三十九座大學」，今日特由該部督學陳東原說明目前教育經費，雖不敷實際需要，相一加以思考，決不信每月三千多萬元，即可辦一座大學。大學開支，因學校規模有大小，所在地區物價亦有高低，實際並不一律。以南京中大論，據目前標準，每月開支達廿九億餘元，包括「學交辦公費」，「教育員生活補助費」，「學術研究補助費」，及「學生瞞費」等四項，屬於修建設又備臨時費尚不在內。重慶大學規模蛟小，所在地區物價亦較低，然侮月開支亦達七億餘元。蔡君用畫面預算，以檢實察開支，邏輯上未免有所偏頗之弊。</p>

<h3>港雙十足球義賽　華聯西聯成和局　劉福銓最後一脚打成平手</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕雙十國慶日，循例有一次慈善足球賽，由舉聯，西聯對壘，地點在海軍球塲，開球時間是下午四時半。國慶假日，球迷特多，四時剛過，便告滿座，港督葛量洪爵士也是座上嘉實，海軍樂隊臨塲演奏，全塲興緻彌高，奏過中英國歌之後，升旗禮完畢，球賽開始。兩隊陣容如下</p>
<p>兩無紀錄　　球一開賽，西隊暫鐘過後，華聯始得初次反擊。過後，又是西聯控制中塲局勢。一次，左翼英士傑近門猛射，均幹拍而復漏，倖渡危關。接着又是混戰，華聯也得機會，迫門猛射，可惜中柱，如此，半塲過去，選定兩無紀錄。</p>
<p>扳成和局</p>
<p>下半塲，匹聯仍握緊攻勢，若非均幹演得出色，華聯早就敗挫。十四分鐘時，球又在華聯禁區來去，慶煜一下大意漏脚，米曹竄進，順勢猛　，均幹無從撲救，先輸一球華聯拼命反攻，僅一分鐘，景　猛射一球，看來必入，卻被特拉斯返拍成角球。再過，時間將完，華聯仍無大好轉，劉福銓忽截得對方開出之球，卅五碼外遙遙遠射，就此扳成和局終塲。</p>
<p>華聯失常</p>
<p>以演出會，華聯該敗，西聯攻固然急，守也守得緊，幾使華聯前鋒欲　無從。再看華聯，五個前鋒無一是處，僅有實景聰比較活潑，後防上，譚均幹力保城池，華聯不敗，應居首功。孔慶煜和謝錦洪也踢得像樣，其他，太失人望了。</p>
<h3>一個具有時代精神的報導　聯敎組織與中國（續完）</h3>
<p>中國職員　　　組織中的中國職員：這組織自前年底至去年底為籌備會時期，內部職員計百餘人。自去年底正式成立，各部工作逐漸發展，各部職員逐漸增多，截至現在十月初止，有職員約五百五十人。中國人在道組織中任職者，也有五人，在　備時期受聘者兩人，一為郭有守，任教育處長，二為能　艾玲（英國生長的華僑，通稱他為Miss　Sam），前任自然科學處助珊員，專改任新聞處助理員，（在籌備時朋受聘者，還有　務沛，任自然科學威參事，今年春已辭職）。自這組機去年底成立義，受聘者三人，一為錢兆　（錢泰長女公子）任教育處助理員，一月就職。二為　　，任亞洲新聞處長，七月　任。三為汪敬　，任自然科學處參事，九月就職。上述五人之外，又有中國臨時職員兩人，一為會學顧問羅忠恕，任期五月，本年十月十五日期滿，二為自然科學處助理員褂桂珍女士，九月中到差，任期原祗一月，現巳延長。</p>
<p>此外與這組織有關的中國人員，如陳源為常務理事之一，如趙鋑欣，周麟，任中國教育部與這組織的聯絡工作，（中國教育部在這組織中設有常駐辦事通訊處），均非這組織所聘任的　員，但與這組微都有眞接的關係</p>
<p>經費預算</p>
<p>組織中的經費預算與中國:去年道組織的巴黎大會通過退組織的經費為美金六百九十五萬元，其中九十五萬元為償還去年　備委員　費用，六百萬元為今年預算經費。</p>
<p>去年這巴黎大會又通過這組織流動周轉金美金三百萬元，各會員國照經發比例交付，但各會員國今年祗各付三分之一，計流動周轉金美金一百萬。</p>
<p>所以，今年這組織的經費及周轉金兩項，共計為美金七百萬元，（明年預算擬為美金九百萬元，將在盛西哥大會中討論決定）。</p>
<p>各會員分擔的經費，大概以在聯合國所付會贊為比例，祇看呈美國特別自動贊助，今年獨付經費全額百分之四十四又零三，即美金約二百四十萬元。</p>
<p>中國今年應付的會費為美金五十一萬零八百二十五元，又周轉金七萬三千五百元，兩項合計為美金五十八萬四千三百二十五元。</p>
<p>明年預算雖擬定為美金九百萬元，（最近常務理事會　決製造明年預算，不得超過美金九百萬元），但各會員國家的分擔，不至比今年所任數目有很大的出入，因為瓜對馬拉，哥倫比，烏拉圭，匈牙利，意大利，瑞士，奧國等七國，均有於明年一月加入道組織的準備，阿根廷亦有加入之說，如立伯利亞Liberia，如古巴等兩國，也是去年底預算案通過後新近加人的，換句話說，明年經費為增加三百萬元，但新會員國家比去冬成立時有增加八九國之可能。</p>
<p>這親織今年將耗費美金六百萬元！這在國際教育文化合作史上是一個空前的數目，是一筆相當的巨款，但這六百萬元用在教育與文化，用在和平與建設，他不過是製造六個輕巡洋艦的經費！他不過是製造十個觀炸機的用費！他不過是第二次世界大戰一日所耗的八十分之一而已！</p>
<p>前途瞻望</p>
<p>組織的前途與中國：這組織在去冬巴黎成立大會時，已經批准約章，及派遺代表之正式會員國家到會出席的，已有三十國，（即中國，亞刺伯，澳火利，比利時，巴利非，巴西，加拿大，丹麥，埃及，埃瓜州，美國，法國，希臘，阿夷底，印度，立朋，墨西哥，挪威，新錫蘭，荷蘭，秘魯，斐律實，波蘭，多米立堅，英國，西利，捷克，士耳其，南非聯判，委內瑞拉），今年又加入立伯利亞，最近又加入古巴。所以這組織至今，巳有正式會員國家三十二國。</p>
<p>在去冬巴黎大會時，已經簽字於一九四五年十一月十六日倫敦約章，但尚未經共政府正式批准之國家，也派遺代表到會的有十二國，（阿根廷，智利·哥侖比亞·古巴·加達馬拉·伊拉克·伊朗·盧森堡·尼加拉乘·巴拿馬·烏拉圭·雅各斯拉夫）。</p>
<p>在去冬巴黎大會時，本為聯全國會員但未簽字於一九四五年倫敦約章之國家，亦請派代表來會列席，共有七國，（俄國·烏克蘭·阿比西尼亞·巴拉圭·Solvador·Costa-rica.Bielorussie）結果，祗巴拉圭·及Costa-Rica。派遣代表到會，列席旁聽。</p>
<p>但非聯合國會眞而派遺代表列席去冬成立大會者，有伊斯朗·瑞典·及瑞士三國。在大會中提名為加入候補會員者，有奧大利·意大利·及瑞士三國。</p>
<p>這些都是中國在這組織中的兄弟會員友邦，中國為最初參加籌備這組織的一國，不但因為他的文化悠久，人日眾多，素好和平，且為世界文化一獨立與重要盟位。今後中國的貢獻，對於這組織的發展，關係很大。中國曾邀請這組織於一九五〇年在中國舉行第五屆常年大會，並說這年恰是孔子降生二千五百年的紀念，「孔予聖之時者也」，假使孔子生當今日，也會努力於世界教育科學文化的合作　動吧。（完）</p>

<h3>對於政府收購辦法　十六業公會表示有條件的擁護　決定原則數項供政府採擇希望擬訂細則時顧念商艱　今日向有關方面請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市與自備外匯進口貨物有關之十六公會代表，昨日午後五時半假香港路一五〇號召開會議，商討對政府收購方案之應付辦法。由進出口公會張耀章主席，各業代表分別報告，顏料五金化學原料鋼條等業仍在本業內商討中，尚未獲得結論。鐵業化學原料業則認爲將貨物重行裝運出口，事　上頗多困難。進出口業及紙業代表則提出對策多項。最後之結論為對政府之收購辦法，在原則上有價件的擁護，惟希望在擬訂實施細則時，能國到商人之處境。旋即開始討論，決定原則數項，提供政府參考採納：</p>
<p>政府所發之特種外幣存單，於第四第五期之限額及非限額分配內，即可抵用。　特種外幣存單到期後，可以此請求輸管會發給許可證，不列入限額之內，且可以此代替結匯。　裝船限期兩月，實嫌太短，應改爲各業間先行登記。凡願重運出口者僅先登記，凡　登記者均有優先運輸權利，直至運元爲止。　在輸管會實施細則中，應明文規定此批貨物將來由政府公賣時，應由原進出口商優先承售於原定廠商。　特種外幣存　應採取不記名方式，且可分割，而能在市塲上流通。如此可使商人資金，不致受凍結之苦。　政府將來之賣出價格，應爲收購價格加一成，仍由原進出口商優光承售。　請求輸管會於擬訂實施細則時，由谷有關公會代表列席以供諮詢。並經議決每一公會推出代表兩名，今日午後二時半赴國行及輸管會請願，並預定晉京向行政院請願一次。各公會將分別召開緊急會議，及舉辦願意重運出口之登記，以爲請願代表之後盾。</p>
<h3>張喜璈希望進口商　犧牲私利顧全大局　同具合作精神事無不可解决</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府對於自備外匯到埠物資處理辦法公布後，進口商方面表示困難，記者昨特　訪輸出入管理委員會兼主任委員張嘉璈氏叩詢意見。當承接見，發表談話稱：「查物資輸入，必經輸管會許可後，方得進口，此爲管理貿易之要點。上海到埠物資，雖商人各持理由，惟未得許可輸入，即不免破壞政府法令。輸出入管理會以物資久擱，終非久計，因呈請政府迅定解決辦法，以期早日結束。嗣行政院會提出院機討論後，交由小組審查，又交經委會計議，又於本星期召集審查會，經博采各方意見，最後有此決定。在審查會中，輸出入管理委員會代表，對於有關顧全商人利益地位之處，均已一再提出，並經審查會盡量容納。在政府處理此事，無非於維護管制法令，防止刺繳黑市，及進口廠商利益，兩者之中，求一兼顧並籌之策，實已煞費苦心。尤其關於刺激黑巿一點，徵之前車，及此次行政院開放自備外匯到貨准許進口消息，一經傳出，外匯黑市突漲，其巾關係，不言而喻。因黑市而阻碍出口與僑匯，因外匯黃金美鈔黑市而牽動物價，實與全民衆之利害關係太大。切盼進口商體會政府處理之苦心，犧牲小我利益，以謀全民衆之福利。至處理細則，輸出入管理委員會正在擬議，務使迅速减少不便。凡事祇須上下同具合作精神，當無不可解決也。」</p>
<h3>輸管即將舉辦　貨物登記</h3>
<p>輸管會對於自備外匯到埠貨物之處理，昨日已奉行政院電令，遵照處理辦法辦理。該會現正着手擬訂施行細則，將呈院核准後實施。據該會發言人稱，收購自備外匯貨物第一步，將先舉辦登記。因按照處理辦法，進口商不願將貨物售與政府者，可於六十日內將貨品重運出口。故凡願將自備外匯貨物遵令出售者，須先向該會登記手續，由該會審核後，予以收購。此項登記，二三日內即行開始。又該會規定重運出口貨物，不得運往香港等地，必須退回原起運地。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨在票據交換所繼續差入五七〇億元，銀根緊勢本弛，暗息仍喊二角二分，華股場外多方貼息，己抬高至三角。昨日差入之款，以棉紗結款佔大宗。計中央入二六億元，大交換出二九億元，外商入三三六億元，小交換出八八三億元，中國入四六〇億元，交通入七億元，中農出一二億元，中信入一三六億元，郵匯出二四億元，合作金庫出二三億元。</p>
<h3>信用合作社存放款不得視同同業往來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於信用合作社與銀錢行莊往來是否可視同同業一節，據悉：財部對此已有具體解釋稱：「查信用合作社除依照法令規定，呈准收受非社員存款外，其授受信用，應以社員爲限，故其性質自與一般銀行迥不相同。茲經本部規定，嗣後各銀錢行莊，如依法與谷信用合作社發生往來關係，不得視同同業。所有收受信用合作社之存訊，均應一律以普通存款款目處理，並應照章繳存存款準備金。對於信用合作社之放款，亦應視同普通客戶，按照一般手續辦理」云。</p>
<h3>生絲外銷漸有起色</h3>
<p>秋後我國外銷生絲漸現起色，迄至目前止，中信局已將廠商交進春季生絲五千五百餘祖中二千祖，趕辦檢騐手續完竣，分批運往法國四五担，英國九〇祖。印度方面八百担，亦於昨日運出。並悉該局預定本月份再須運印及美各一千祖，英七五祖。至運美之貨，已定於廿五日裝柯塞輪（Courser）運往。海外目前市價，約每磅四元四角及四元二角美元之問。英市塲需要生絲條紋較細，開價較優。如印度局勢轉佳，我國生絲銷路常更見活潑。美以有存絲五六萬担及日絲八九萬担，充斥市塲，市價呆滯。日絲價格下降，義絲且跌至三元五角左右云。</p>

<h3>警部注意投機華股中途疲怯</h3>
<p>華股昨永紗高後，因銀根奇緊，塲外交貨非易，息價再昂，亭鼠被迫在塲內套售，急切回跌。最後形勢怯疲，惟小型股間有異軍突起者。華新由一〇七號吸收，勤興新股由二〇四號維護，前者漲成半，後者漲達限度。</p>
<p>晨開榮辱互見，開後勤興首先上升，美亞在軋空情况下，亦告邁進。惟永紗有人脫手，退至即交三一五元，遞交三三一元低價。美亞勤興愈盤愈好，永紗亦拉上至即交三三四元，遞交三五〇元高價。新亞漲停，勤興亦迫漲限。孰料十時後，亭鼠紛紛套賣，情况陡變。了結者多，塲外息價又開高至二角五分半及三角，交貨不易，逐步下游。近午永紗退至即交三一五元，遞交三三一元，而後以三一七元及三三三元之價收市。結果較前收即交股計動興新光漲停，美亞中絲新埀水泥商務微升，華　中法閘北跌半成，永紗信和內衣統益中紡榮豐麗安信誼微挫，新光景綸火柴恒豐中興均平。遞交股計勤興漲停，美亞漲一成，永紗信和新光升半成，餘均微漲。</p>
<p>後市聞紗價又好，人心見振。永紗漲到即交三二七元遞交三四二元。終以應付投機市塲，警部已有對策，人心轉疲，永紗仍以三一八元及三三一低檔收市。結果較晨收計即交股永紗信和華獲內衣新華閘北中紡統益火柴微升，美亞中絲榮豐微挫，華新漲一成，勤興仍站漲停，餘者平和。遞交股訂動興漲停，華鹽微降，永紗信和亦然，新光景福平平。</p>
<p>現遞套利交易，昨合息價一角六至二角左右。永紗貼價開市十五元，自十六元退至十四元，而以十五元收市。美亞自二十五元退至二十元，而以二十三元結束。信和在六元半至七元半間，新光在一元半左右。</p>
<h3>政府計劃　改良茶葉產銷</h3>
<p>今年我國外銷茶生產，估計約可達三十餘萬市担。截至六月底止，經上海商品檢驗局驗放者爲七萬三千四百七十九祖，經台灣特產檢驗處驗放者爲六萬五千三百三十四担。近以外匯調整，茶商已可獲利，對外輸出，稍呈活躍現象。但國茶產銷方法，仍形洛後，不適於國外競銷。行政院有見及此，曾令由農林部會商有關機關，草擬外銷茶葉產銷計劃綱要，以圖改進，現正呈請核示中云。</p>

<h3>外銷茶停滯</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶巿：賣戶居寄扳抬之念，依然未戰，而出口行鑒於國外茶價低平如故，因此目前仍不欲急於高價進取，致交易　　陷於停頓，但形勢咸滯穩俏。至於內銷花色，本街店莊及近鄉各地，猶圖染指，惜受供應稀少之影響，卒難　心所欲，成交數量亦見减色，做開行情，益趨佳境。</p>
<h3>香烟由疲轉堅</h3>
<p>香烟市面，因常局抑平物價，一般散多，連日斬殺殆盡，下跌頗勁。昨以塲內買戶活躍，又有廠據調整等利買消息傳播，市勢止疲轉挺。結果十支大英烟，比上日回漲六十五萬元，老刀亦好十五萬元。共餘中外各條烟，及五十支聽　　，一致跟升二三千元。</p>
<p>日用品固本皂廠盤提高，買氣活潑，行情回升一萬元。其他各脾亦帶好五千至一萬，惟火柴市仍下挫五萬至二十餘萬不一。</p>

<h3>分配會議圓滿結束　人造絲配量决定　上海得總額百分之六五</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局召集各地絲織，織帶，針織各業公會代表，討論人造絲分配之會議，業於昨日下午圓滿結束。各地代表對人造絲分配比例，雖不無爭執，惟終告和衷共濟，順利解決。各地絲織業人造絲之分配比例，以按照各地絲織機之實際台數爲準。依此計算，上海得總額百分之六五，杭州等六地，共得百分之三五。</p>
<p>各地織機台數，杭州五五三五台，蘇州一五五七台，盛澤一一一四台，吳興四六三台，無錫一六四台，天津一〇八六台，上海六八〇〇台。</p>
<p>今如假設每月配量爲七千箱，則其分配比例爲：上海四五五〇箱，外埠各地共二四五〇箱。內杭州一三七〇箱，蘇州，三八四箱，盛澤二七五箱，吳興一一四箱，無錫四〇箱，天津二六七箱。</p>
<p>又假設織帶業配量每月爲五八〇箱，則上海得五百箱，蘇州八十箱。其他各地，以未有需要報到，暫不核配。</p>
<p>針織業方面因人造絲並非主要原料，故會中並未討論。將來需要時，由中信局人造絲核配會議，參酌實際情形，再行核配。又如中信局每月到絲數量有增减時，即照上定數字，比例增减核配。</p>
<p>銀根抽緊人絲價疲</p>
<p>人造絲昨巿一二〇號旭字有光等，上午先喊八千萬元賣出價，最小七千五百萬元有成交，下午七千八百萬元有人要，最後因銀根抽緊，人心漸虛，喊價七千八百萬元賣出，但乏人過問，三A貨下午六千八九百萬元有成交。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨巿上午略有成交，D字等級做開六千八百萬元七天期票，另担中級貨價六七百萬元，高級八百萬元，貨款俱有幾天期頭。下午因銀根呈緊，供多求少。並無成交。干經貨稀，喊價穩站。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>眞絲被面大誠與華強貨，開巿在二千二百九十萬至三百萬元之間，最大隔日期做四十五萬元，收市時稍下降，最後即期做二百九十萬元，隔日做三百十萬元。美亞貨價仍平，惟乏成交，華錦　高檔貨喊六萬元，各貨成交極寥，喊價堅穩。</p>

<h3>高血壓原理之最新發見</h3>
<p>— 王完白</p>
<p>鄙人有高血壓，故對之倍覺關切，近見美國著名雜誌Time。揭載高而壓之新理，眾感興趣，方在電台播音講過，茲又承木刋索稿，即筆譯錄呈，並請指正。</p>
<p>驚人之發明</p>
<p>高血壓佔居美國所有死亡率之三分之一，故體界皆認木病爲二十世紀文明時代由最危險之疾病，且亦爲最不易明瞭之疾病。然時至今日，已可將不易瞭解之謎，加以明瞭之解釋，因有英國科學家已尋到木病之綫索。其發明之結論，乃而壓之增高，實因腎贓內之血液循環「縮短路綫」之故。所以發生此現象‘者，則爲神經常過於緊張耳。</p>
<p>壓傷之褪</p>
<p>對於高血壓新理之發明實出於偶然之機緣，一如靑微素Penicillin之發明亦係出於偶然。當一九四一年英國偷教遭敵機猛烈轟炸時，救傷之路師發見被坍屋壓傷之人民，若其褪部受重物壓迫至數小時之久者，當右忽成腎臟衰竭Kidney　failure而突然死去，狀頗（神秘，其危險與心臟衰竭無異。</p>
<p>然腿部受壓何以關礙腎臟，旋有一西班牙籍醫師屈露泰Josep　Trueta及其四位同工，在牛津醫學研究院中，閒飴對家兎作血液循環之試驗。彼等川止血帶緊縛兎之後腿，再將有色　液注入兎之動脈中，以X光察其結果，不久即查得其神秘之答案，几腿部動脈經過長期之壓迫，附近血管即起痙攣，結果阻來其腎臟之血液循環，故發生腎臟衰竭之危險後果。</p>
<p>腎外質貧血</p>
<p>因肢體久受壓迫而成腎臟衰竭之理，旣經研究成功，屈氏研究國作更進一步之探求。查得腎臟之血液循環，白內層至外層有一種自動之應急處置，當腎外質之血運被阻時，其動脈中血液即另趨捷徑，逕由腎內質較大之血管通過而迥返靜脈，因此腎臟外質即成爲極度貧困，無血液無養氣，以致餓死。（Starved）其結局如下，　分泌之尿液减少甚或全停。　貧血之腎外質立即分泌一種物質，（大概爲一種荷爾蒙）藉以刺激全身增高血壓。</p>
<p>根據以上發明，屈氏　究團覓得綫索，此項縮短腎臟血運路徑之現象，亦可由多種其他刺激方法而產生之。例如以電力刺激某部神經，亦可得同樣效果，又如嚴軍之出血，或應用重量之內泌素，（如腎上腺素蝶鞍腺素）或注射化膿菌所分泌之毒素等，皆可發生刺激作用。故該研究團下一決論，奮興之神經，收縮腎藏血管，使血運不經腎外質之細微血管，而轉入腎內質較組之血管中，以致腎外質缺乏血液，因而自動調節，增高血壓，迫使身上之血液多到腎讓外質。</p>
<p>情感之襲擊</p>
<p>醫家早巳感覺某種高血壓與腎臟有密切關係，且亦深知忿怒或其他情感之襲擊，可使血壓昇高。吾人向有所謂「本質性高血壓」者，Essential　Hypertension佔全數血壓病百分之九十五之多僅知其與腎臟有關，而不克詳加解釋。今屈氏研究團所表演高血壓之生理循　，可以說明此本質性高血壓之原理</p>
<p>屈氏研究團之見解，腎臟血運之變化，不過爲被動之工具，而操竄此工其者實爲神經。凡神經系統突受意外之損傷，或情感上緊張之刺戟，即可造成此種打擊。故研究團在最近出版之「瞥臟血運之研究」一書中宜佈，略謂我等深信形成高血壓之主要事一實，旣已查明屬於神經中區，亦即在人類自已之心靈中，彼等果能完全瞭解此點，對於本質性高血壓之患者，實具有莫大之新希一望。（譯者按，意則望患者勿終日處於憂慮恐慌慣忙之緊張狀能中，故怡然安樂之心境，乃防治高血壓之秘訣。）</p>
<h3>DDT與囚犯衛生（續）</h3>
<p>— 胡起鵬</p>
<p>這是人道和法律方面講，我們要注意監獄的衛生，囚犯生活的改進。在公共衛生方面講，也應該電視。尤其是建築在都市裘的監獄，因爲監獄裏發生傳染病，很有機會傳播市民，成爲大流行的可能。如一五七七，一七三〇，一七五〇，數年，英國之監獄，三次發生傳染癘疫，因犯死亡枕籍，以致傳播市民，死者亦甚夥，現在就以上海市幾個監獄看守所來講，歷年都有因患傷寒，斑疹傷寒，回歸熱等傳染病而死亡的。在民國廿二，廿七，廿九。卅三數年間，本市思南路上海地方法院看守所，（即前馬斯南路上海第二特區監獄），發生斑疹傷寒（此病在監獄裏很容易發生，所以從前有牢獄之稱），傳染非常利害。監所內的囚犯死亡率大破記錄，看守，職員，監獄長，監獄醫官，都有被傳染及死亡的。卅三年敵僞時代，僞司法行政部長張一鵬，因爲到監視察，亦被傳染不治而死。同年市民患者也很多。和平以來的兩年裹，各監所由善後救濟署配給到許多DDT液劑和粉劑。監所醫官得隨時愼重使用，因此往年可怕的斑疹傷寒和回歸熱的患者，就逐漸减少。至卅五年度已經沒有發現。這是因爲這兩種病的病毒，完全由於衣虱做媒介而傳播。監所的囚犯，因爲衣被不淸潔，難得更洗，最容易發生蚤　。現在蚤虱之類，被DDT所殺，這兩種可怕的的傳染病也就消滅了。看這張統計圖表所示，各監所收容囚犯的的數與死亡人數成反比例。拿過去的死亡數來比較，可以說DDT是拯救了許多要病死的囚犯。</p>
<p>上海市各監所民國三十四及三十五年度收容囚犯及死亡人數表</p>
<p>常然講求監所囚犯衛生，決不是說有了DDT，就可以有持無恐。重要的仍就要注意到囚犯的居所，飲食，衣被，運動山環境的淸潔，以及精前上的術生。這都是根本改良監所衛生的要點。譽如拿囚犯衣被的衛生來講，囚犯入監所以後，全體服用監所製備的衣被，並且時常沐浴，得以換洗，使蚤虱之類，無從寄生，蚤虱絕　，DDT也就不是必須要用的了。斑疹傷寒和回歸熱兩處傳染病，也就永遠不會在監獄裏發現。囚犯衣被整潔，不但有關清潔衛生，就是在監所戒護和觀瞻方面，也有重要的關係所以深信賢明的司法當局，鑒於監所囚犯衛生能影嚮市民的公共衛生、同時須要實現近代自由刑的意旨，一定能積極的改善監所囚犯衛生。（續完）</p>
<h3>漫談小兒驚風</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>驚風是小兒最多的疾病，試從罵路上走過，「世代祖傳推拿，專治急慢驚風」的招牌，是到處可以看見。驚風的時候，眞是靑天薛靈的事情，一個活發伶俐的小孩子，忽然地口吐白沬，人事不省，全身痙攣起來，弄得全家誘偟，求醫問卜，措手不及。「急驚風碰着慢郎中」一種惶急的態度，可以從這八個字裹看出來。</p>
<p>在醫學上講起來，驚風並不是一種病的名稱，實在是一種病的症狀，凡是小兒發熟性疾患，消化器疾息，急性消化不良，赤痢，腦膜炎，腦炎，或是百日咳，尿毒症的時候，往往會發生痙　。因爲乳孩兒的腦中樞，他的反射抑制機能，還沒有十分發達，些小的刺戟；就可以發生痙　或呈痙攣樣狀態，尤以小兒逢到高熱的時候，他的反射機能；多少亢進，更易引起全身　搦樣的發作。還有一種神經質的小兒，受到些小的驚恐，或則憤怒的時侯，忽然引起痙舉。更有因爲腸寄生蟲譬如蛔蟲的存在，也可以引起痙攣。眞性　　，俗呌做羊　瘋的以及症候性　癎：例如先天性痴呆，腦性小兒麻痹，腦炎後遺症，也都可以引起痙攀的。</p>
<p>痙　時的應急處置：引起痙舉的原因，旣然有這樣的多，病家自己當然不能治療，但是在醫師未到之前，應急的手段，也是很重要的，第一先耍把患兒安靜臥床，寬鬆患兒的衣服，用冷手巾或冰囊，放置頭部，促其醒覺，極力避去各種的刺戟，用屛風來遮住强力的光綫；開放窗戶，以通空氣，病室應當安靜，國人對於小兒驚　的時候，常常不自覺的大聲疾呼，甚至將磁器打碎，有時醫師進去的時候，竟至無從下脚，這不但是一種無聊的舉動，對病人也是沒有利益的。一方面先要灌腸，可以使腸內容物排除，减輕鼓腸，同時也可以减輕痙攣。灌賜後的大便，應當保存起來，等到醫師來的時候，可以檢查大便的性質，尤以痢疾琉行的時候，患兒還沒有下痢，先發生高熱和痙攣，是常常遇到的事情。</p>
<p>至於醫治的方法，當然需要醫師來了以後，經過檢查，再行治療。談到預後方面，隨病情有不同。但是引起小兒痙攣的疾病，大多是感冒發熱，消化不良，便閉，蛔蟲等等，自然沒有多大的危險，王老娘，李媽媽的推拿有効，大多是這樣的病症。如果鐵腦炎，腦膜炎，痢疾等等，不早嚮治的話，那就有生命危險。</p>
<h3>哺乳兒營養障礙</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>人乳營養兒之營養障礙</p>
<p>由營養過剩而起溢乳，吐乳，泄瀉時，以短縮哺乳時間，同時减少回數四五小時以內勿行哺一乳爲宜。</p>
<p>泄瀉劇甚時，有先與以少量之瀉劇，後與以收斂劑者，瀉劑用甘　（以〇·〇一頓服，或每回〇·〇五作一包一日三回）菎麻子油（一日三·〇頓服）；作收歙劑者，賞用次硝酸鉍（每回〇·一，一日三回）等。</p>
<p>即使恢復之後，每日五六回以上授乳之事亦宜禁止。</p>
<p>營養不給</p>
<p>乳汁分泌之不足者，可測定授乳前後之體重以確實判明之。此外分泌雖充分，但母乳之性質，似初乳時，行混合營養法；若乳汁之分泌依然不足或含有初乳球，因而小兒之發育不良胃腸症狀不减退時，可開始斷乳，廢母乳，但仍不宜全廢母乳。</p>
<p>至若母體之急性胃腸病，腎臟炎，母體之脚氣等時，或乳兒起病狀者，則以先試混合營養仍不令離乳爲方針。</p>
<p>人乳不適合之情形</p>
<p>母體或乳母之罹急性傳染病時，或乳兒呈著明之脚氣病之症狀時，及授乳婦之結核病時，不得不廢乳而另選健全之乳母；除此類情形外，如授乳婦並無何等異常，且對於他小兒，乳汁適合，獨不適於其小兒而起嘔吐，泄瀉等營養障礙時，在實際上雖極少，但亦不乏其例，此時亦應廢乳而與以另一乳母之乳，或不得不完全移至人工營養焉。然最好以混合營養法爲宜。總之乳母選擇（Ammenwahl）之標準，莫若檢乳母自己之兒之營養狀態。</p>
<p>人乳營養兒之便秘</p>
<p>人乳營養兒之便秘，有由於乳汁之攝取量少者，亦有來於過多者，故應先注意於此點，而便秘之療法，最好以勿用藥劑爲方針。</p>
<p>一，灌腸，（甘油或水與甘油各等分）</p>
<p>二，腹部之按摩，最初以拇指與示指揉捏腹部之皮膚二分至三分鐘，　乃按摩腹直肌從上部向下方再從下部向上方，後按摩側腹肌（以拇指當前腹部，他四指對之置側背）更載手掌於　與　骨間作圓形之運動，輕輕摩擦最後想像沿空腸作一致於其蠕動之狀，順次按摩。此項按摩，時有奏效者。</p>
<p>三，用Liebig氏汁或麥芽汁膏每日用一二茶匙溶於湯水中與之。（參照附錄）（未完）</p>
<h3>黃疸病</h3>
<p>— 儲麟蓀</p>
<p>這個名稱是很通俗的，我們看見這個名詞，或者聽到這個各詞，就會想到一個病人的皮膚，眼白，顯出特別的黃顏色，小便的顏色也很深，相反的，大便有時呈灰白色，，皮膚發癢，脈搏比較慢些，好橡診斷黃疽病是很容易的，不需要請教醫生　自己能斷定生的什麼病，吃些黃疸病的　不是就好了麼？　賞，有許多的藥品，或者是什麼秘方，你吃了幾天，慢慢兒的病好了，你認爲是藥的功效，可是，事實不是這樣；因爲有許多病，你一些藥也不吃，過一個相當的時間，他自然的好了，有的人呢，也生黃疸病，吃了同樣的藥方，非但沒有好；幾乎送掉了命。或許吃了在別人身上有效的，靈驗的仙丹，而眞的把自己的命送掉了，這是什麼道理呢？因爲沒有適當的診斷和治療，好是運氣，不好是理想中的事情！</p>
<p>黃疸病是一種病狀，有很多的病，很多的原因，可以顯出道同樣的病狀，這是一個症像同而原因不同的很好例子，還有很多病，原因同而發現的症狀不同。</p>
<p>現在，把可以生黃疸症狀的幾種主要疾病的名稱介紹給讀者：傳染性黃疸，同一血淸性黃疽，此素治療性黃疽”化學性黃疽，系統性傳染病而生的黃疽，肝臟急性黃色萎縮。Weil，氏病，放綫因病，白血病，Horlgkin氏病，澱粉樣變性病，包蟲病，Leishmaniasis，Histoplasmosis，肝膿　（甲，細菌化膿性，乙·阿米巴性），充血性心臟病，甲狀腺中毒症，膵炎，十二指腸潰瘍，慢性肝炎（硬化性），膵癌，Vater氏膨大部癌，肝外膽管癌，膽囊癌，轉移性肝癌，原發性肝癌，急性膽囊炎，膽管結石，膽管狹窄，巨脾性溶血性黃疽，體質性肺臟機能障礙，初生兒黃疸。</p>
<p>雖則寫了這許多的病名，還沒有完全，然而對一般的讀者已太多了！這幾個病名也許給你一個影像，原來黃疽是一個症狀，他病的原因很多，原因不同，治療的方法也當然不同，有的要外科醫師；有的要內科醫師，有的要兒科醫師山因爲初生兕黃疽的原因有的也很複雜，需要做詳細的鑒別診斷。總之，無論男，女，老，小，有病時應當請醫師詳細的檢查，決定一個確實的診斷，最有效並且最經濟的治療方法，不要自作聰明，一知半解的藥石亂投，時常有很多的疾病，在今日的醫藥能診斷和治療的，往往被病人或家屬一誤再誤；結果成了一個無名的犧甡者！</p>

<h3>阿拉伯民族</h3>
<p>— 倫</p>
<p>提起了阿拉伯民族，不禁令人聯想到許多歷史的回憶。在一千三百年前，先知謨罕獸德便向阿拉伯西部的市民和部落，宣傳一神主義的宗教，這種宗教就是回教的開始。在紀元六二二年，　建立了殖民地，强迫被征服的人民，服從他們的語實，種族　，並且傳佈他們的宗教信仰；由於一種合併（其中也有拒絕合併的），於是便產生了一號新的較偉大的阿拉伯民族。所以直到現在，罕默德在麥迪那建立了一個小小國家。但這個小國家可不要輕視阿，因爲他右着一頁非常光榮燦爛的歷史，那是他在八十年以內，曾經縱橫於亞洲的西部，直抵阿當汗山嶽區，並且越過了北非，達到了大西洋沿岸。他們每到一處，便示問人稱學隊用什麼界說來解釋阿拉伯民族這問題，我們只有一個可以差近事實的答案，凡承認謨罕默德的使命以及阿拉伯帝國的信仰，作爲歷史中心事賞，以及凡承認阿拉伯靈言和它的文化傳統爲共同遺產的人們，都是阿拉伯人</p>
<p>一百多年來的阿拉伯人，生存在中古回敎文化傳統之下，仍裘保椦着一種社會和經濟利益的平衡，和宗教的制戰，而對政治與政府問題，他們毋寗保持一穩冷漠的態度，他們富有排外性，把歐洲人當作化外的野蠻民族。</p>
<p>回敎民族主義的出發點，毋寨說是宗教性的而非民族性的，關於這一點是應該讓我們牢記的。他們現在正在恢復既往伊斯籣帝國的美夢，以阿拉伯大聯盟的新姿熊出現在現世界政治舞台的上面，這種希望，爲着民族運動的澎湃，已逐漸加濃了。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<p>健忘</p>
<p>— 榮觀</p>
<p>不久以前中國被議爲健忘的民族，民族而健忘，大概種源於春秋時的吳王，史載吳王闔閭攻越被勾踐戰死，吳王兒子（夫差）每天使人立在庭前，逢有出入便呼名而問：「夫差！你忘了越人的殺父之仇嗎」？他答：「我不敢忘記的」</p>
<p>說是「不敢忘記」，但三年後，夫差打敗了勾踐；勾踐稱臣求和，獻納美女，夫差縱情聲色，前師也忘個乾淨。「二十年後，再見高低」，夫差被迫仍訂城下之盟。推夫差是健忘之祖，諒來少有反對的。</p>
<p>所借，「道不行，則乘　浮衣悔」，曾幾何時，此健忘症，已橫渡太平洋，抵海之東，號稱科學發達先天下而進入原子時代的山姆叔叔，大概用腦過度，却徧徧少進補腦汁。自家記憶力薄弱那也罷了！養虎貽患，其影饗人類的和平何？但花旗老人徧徧不計及此。以下就是一例：</p>
<p>復興德日的工作，已趨具體措施，雖開明號稱「美國舵手」的馬歇爾在其援歐計劃上也亳無掩飾地表現了復興德國西部的意向。在日本，來帥以徧袒日木的「民主」爲己任：鉅額的貸款，貿易的開放……此猶不足；管日委會主席的施巴德還火上添油地堅決主張應將日木的工業水準提高超過一九三〇—三四的舊有標準。……</p>
<p>這樣，未來的覆轍是不顯自明了—雖然，夫差之忘國仇，還是在「十年生聚，十年敎訓」這長期的準備之後。而如今距「珍珠港戰爭」還不足六年，我們的老美，怎又將前事完全遺忘了呢？這豈是「頂好」的事？</p>
<p>而且，夫差的健忘，還不過是自家吃海的事，但在老美，這一忘，常新的戰爭機會來臨時，却是萬千的生靈同嘗　炭之災了！唉！唉！</p>
<h3>直綫與曲綫</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>中國人離開學校，到社會上來鬼混幾年，接述碰了若千次軟硬的釘子以後，經騐吿訴他，要在中國這樣的社會裏活下去，太老實是不行的，便知道採用「選實擎虛」，「不打硬仗」，「伺隙乘便」……等等的戰略，從事於生活的鬥爭了。這樣的戰略，其目的就在以最小的犧性，爭取最大的戰果，使戰利品滿載而歸，一勞永逸。</p>
<p>不過，初出茅廬的年青人，往往年少氣盛，不懂得這一套處世的哲學，面對着樹上結實的葉子，垂涎欲滴，急於吞食，恨不得大踏步衝上去，擒取到嘴；但常被絆脚石所絆倒。至於，有經騐的人，就能避開容易碰壁的直綫，在面面供到，萬無一失的情形下，滿足自己的欲求了。</p>
<p>記得一年前汪記漢奸陳公博繆斌之流，爲要粉刷自己的醜行，曾在法庭上謊稱其叛國行爲，是一稱曲綫式的愛國，叛國與愛國的區別，明朗如白畫之於黑夜，叛國者而猶自稱是曲綫的愛國，其綫之曲，無以復加矣。</p>
<p>中國人愛講面子，好尙虛浮，從不能實事求是，即右完密的計劃，也難照計而行，因爲在仃的時候，必須面面俱到，才能避免校節橫生的　故，眞有喊日持久，徒勞無益之感；然不如此、則阻力更多，簡直一步不能行。一般走江湖的，愛狗皮膏藥的，當他們擺下擂台，開始獻按時，就得沿着壞立的觀衆，打躬作揖，嘴裏念念有辭，請衆位弟兄多多帮忙：唱京戲的，要開碼頭，也是一樣。　傲的余叔岩不理這一套，很想打破這種「拜山頭」的惡習；但他第一次在上海登台，就碰了一鼻子灰，被逼着立刻　演，連夜購票回北平，永不再來上海。以此爲例，可見立身處世之難。雖然科學已進步到原子世紀，而社會各階層這稱開碼頭，拜山頭的風氣，到今天不僅原對未動，恐已變本加厲了。</p>
<p>此刻大大小小的衙門，都有「人事室」或「交際科」之類的單位，其原始的動機，是爲了節省多數人的時間，不必在人事的糾紛上作無限止的浪費，才另設機構，以專責成，讓他們諸事不管，專於沿着渺茫的曲綫，向各方面打躬作揖，以求避免摩擦，减少料紛，誰知道摩擦更烈，而糾紛乃多至不可際極。</p>
<p>中國人的平均壽命只卅五歲，爲了爭取時效，人家走曲綫，我們要走直綫，人家走直錢，我們要走最短的「垂直綫」，才能迎頭趕上去，然我們偏要大紆圍。</p>
<p>而今事實在面前建設，是走的紆圍的曲綫，破壞，倒是選取乾脆的直錢，所以我們貴國的同胞，都是成事不足，欺事有餘。</p>

<h3>革命草補</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>雲堯君在木刊寫過「革命草」一文，筆者就所知，再來補充幾句。</p>
<p>革命草在鄕間，的確被看爲「害命草」，不但抗嘉湖一帶有發現，便是在筆者故鄕寗波，也是河港中到處滋生，妨礙行舟。若把牠撩上岸，　田沒有滋養料，晒乾火燒遣灰極少，可謂百無一用。</p>
<p>「革命草」在上海花圃中也有出售，大都是種在泥盆中，葉淡緣，浮水若麥葉，有點像銀杏樹葉，莖短，中成圓球形而空，鄕人名之曰大砲，革命打仗要用大砲也。頂上開花，作淡藍色，好似燕子花，能連續開上三五朵，美麗悅目，可作盆景。因莖有氣泡，浮水不沉，而生殖力甚强，鄕人若不踏時取締，不上一二月河港蓋塞，阻礙交通。</p>
<p>「革命草」在民國四五年間，大量發見，常時浙東方面士匪，當自稱爲「二次革命軍」，敲詐勒索，人民撼之，適值此草發現，便稱之爲革命草，待土匪消減，而此草也由鄕民儼人打　除盡，以爲信而有　，名副其實了。</p>
<p>待民國八年，學生五四運動，風起雲湧，罷課游行演講，化裝演戲，發起抵制日貨運動，那時這草又二次番衍，河面淤塞，鄕人稱之爲「學生草」，謂其花固燦爛，而莖實空虛，既不能肥田，又不能當柴燒，莊「百無一用」是書生也，不想在抗戰期間，此草三度猖獗，似鄕人除革命草，學生草之外，又呌出）名爲「和平草」，是指僞組織和平軍實力空虛，却會到處擾民也。</p>
<p>鄕民命此草之名，三易其稱，寓意於草木，亦可見民心之一般了！</p>
<h3>幽默集錦</h3>

<p>「嗯，」乙說：「我最近請專家檢查我的心臟，他說我的心臟情形太壞了，可能隨時致死。因此，我想以一站一站的買票爲妥。」</p>

<h3>獵獵西風話菊花</h3>
<p>— 殊向</p>
<p>「可歎東離菊，莖疏葉且微，雖言異蘭蕙，亦自有芳菲，未冷盈樽酒，徒沾淸露　，當榮君不採，飄落洛欲何依。」</p>
<p>——李白</p>
<p>流浪江甫，獵獵西風中，看到變　黃菊，菊花是古時隱士的代表，自從經過陶淵明的品題後，便爲一班人所愛好了。</p>
<p>菊花有兩種，一種莖紫，氣香，味甘，葉可作蔬容食的才是眞種，另一種塞靑，作　艾氣味，不堪食用的，是苦薏，苦意同眞菊花一樣，頗難分辯，普通人都把苦萓意真菊種的。</p>
<p>菊花的種類最多，范成大的菊譜，把菊花化列成三十五品，王象晋的羣芳譜，又把菊化列成一百七十二種，顏色分黃，白，紫，紅四色，實際到現在，菊花的種類，恐怕已到三百多種了</p>
<p>名品有御袍黃，太師紅，綠天蓉等一百七十餘種，以正統講，菊花化以黃色爲貴，不過俗尙新奇。許多人都喜歌看紅紫等雜色，正色的菊花，倒不爲人所貴了。</p>
<p>咏菊詩最容易見人性情，貴耳集載：「黃巢五歲侍翁父，爲菊花聯句，翁思索未至，巢信口應曰:「堪與百花爲爲總首，自然天賜赭黃衣」巢父怪欲擎之；乃翁曰:孫能詩，但未知輕重，可令再賦一篇。巢又曰：「颯颯西風滿院栽，蕊寒香冷蝶難來，他年我若爲膏帝，移共桃花一處開，」跋扈的意思，已見孩時。他如朱元能的咏菊計，也說:「百花發時我不發，我若發時衆嚇煞，要與西風戰一塲，滿身披上黃金甲。」也是九五自命的意思。不過咏：「去年元宵時，花市燈如畫」的朱淑眞，對菊花却說：「土花能白又能紅，晚節猶能愛此工，寗可抱香枝上老，不隨黃葉舞秋風，」這種貞烈自守的口吻，與「不見去年人，淚濕腎衫袖，」大不相同了。</p>
<p>採羣芳的唐伯虎，到寗德宿邸看菊盡，也愀然的慼題絕句云：「黃花無采爲誰容，冷落疏籬曲徑中，儘把金錢貿脂粉，一生顏色付西風，」風物蕭條的深秋，看見這孤介高潔的黃花。多少人都會傷秋悲秋的。</p>

<h3>The National Economic Commission Discusses Price Controls and Will Implement Effective Multi-faceted Regulations After Deciding on Measures Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Stabilizing prices was one of the most important issues discussed at the National Economic Commission meeting on the 16th. After the meeting, Chen Qitian and others, who recently went to Shanghai for on-the-spot investigations, reported on their findings. Chen Qitian reported on the work of the Textile Adjustment Committee and the Fuel Management Committee, as well as the reasons for the rise in cloth and coal prices. He pointed out that the price of cloth rose due to the increase in yarn prices, while the price of coal rose due to safety problems in the production areas. Huang Yuanbin reported on the financial investigations in Shanghai and provided reports and analyses on foreign exchange banks. Shi Kuiling reported on the investigation of the prices of daily necessities such as rice, coal, and oil. He Chouxiang also provided a report. During their reports, Chen and others analyzed that the recent price increases were due to psychological and military factors, and that prices in Hong Kong also had an impact on Nanjing and Shanghai. Recently, due to the publication of the "Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange Measures," the National Bank's tightening of funds, the publication of the Pulitzer thesis, and the Shanghai municipal authorities' investigation of yarn supply and sales, prices have tended to stabilize and are currently continuing to fall. The investigations by Chen and others have been completed. Shi Kuiling will return to Shanghai on the evening of the 16th, and Liu Zhendong, who is currently in Shanghai, will also be able to return to Nanjing next Monday or Tuesday. The entire investigation work is expected to be completed by the beginning of next month, at which time the investigators will discuss detailed measures with the relevant ministries and departments, submit them to the National Economic Commission next Thursday, and immediately implement them to effectively control prices in multiple ways. It is heard that future measures may involve both regulatory and comprehensive approaches, that is, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes at the same time. There will also be appropriate measures for how to coordinate technology and policy. Once the measures are decided, they will be implemented immediately. Huang Yuanbin, who also went to Shanghai for investigation, visited President Zhang after returning to Nanjing on the 16th and reported on his findings. It is heard that Huang proposed 15 construction points, including suggestions for improving the black market for foreign exchange, banks, and overseas remittances.</p>
<h3>The National State-Owned Enterprise Management Law Handed Over to Eight Committee Members for Review; Import Quotas for Trucks and Diesel Fuel Relaxed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The National Economic Commission discussed the following four major cases at its meeting on the 16th: The case of relaxing truck import quotas. This case was proposed by the Shanghai Truck Transportation Association, which requested that the truck import quota be opened to 500 vehicles per quarter. The meeting resolved four points: A) Under the premise of regulating the smooth transportation of materials and taking into account the saving of foreign exchange, the number of open quotas shall be decided by the Transportation Management Committee in conjunction with the Ministry of Communications; B) Revise Part 1 of Appendix 2 of the Import and Export Trade Measures, 256; C) It is recommended that the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation Management Committee should take into account the general needs of the country when allocating quotas for imported vehicles; D) The brands of imported vehicles are currently complex, and parts repair is difficult and should be simplified. Draft Law on the Management of State-Owned Enterprises. During the discussion of this case, many parties agreed that state-owned enterprises should be enterprise-oriented as soon as possible, focusing on profits and losses, and turning over profits to the state treasury. It was decided to hand it over to Wang Yunwu, Chen Lifu, Xu Kan, and other eight people for review. The case of suspending the purchase of export materials was resolved to first have the China Trust Bureau report the reactions from all parties after the suspension of purchases to the meeting, and then the Secretariat would study the measures in detail. The case of relaxing diesel fuel quotas. During the discussion, the committee members believed that diesel fuel was essential for industry and more economical than coal, and decided to increase the original quota for the third quarter from US$5.5 million to US$9.05 million.</p>
<h3>Qian Industry Joint Association Established Wu Dingchang Reads President Chiang's Instructions and Finance Minister Yu Encourages Promotion of Past Virtues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The National Joint Association of Qian Industry Associations was officially established in Nanjing on the 16th. A total of 83 representatives from various regions attended the meeting. All representatives visited the mausoleum at 8:00 a.m. and held the opening ceremony at 10:00 a.m. President Chiang issued instructions, which were read by Wu Dingchang on the spot. Qin Runqing, chairman of the Preparatory Committee, presided over the opening ceremony, pointing out that the Qian industry has been diligent in its service in the past and sacrificed the small self. In the future, this habit of supporting industry and commerce should be maintained and encouraged. The adjustment of rural areas and family handicrafts is still the specialty of Qianzhuang. It is hoped that Qian industry in urban and rural areas will establish contact and cooperate with each other. At today's meeting, I hope that everyone will express their opinions and make progress together. Then, Liang Jiezhi, Secretary-General of the Congress, reported on the preparations. After Wu Dingchang read the President's instructions, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun delivered a speech, encouraging them to promote past virtues and styles, innovate old shortcomings, and hope that they would supervise and encourage each other, not speculate, not take risks, not violate the law, and assist the government in implementing financial policies and stabilizing the financial market. Huang Bodu, representative of Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Yu Jingtang, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, and Shen Yi, Mayor of Nanjing, also delivered speeches. The ceremony was completed at 11:30 a.m. In the afternoon, nine units including the Four Joint Offices and the Four Banks and Two Bureaus hosted a banquet for the representatives.

<h3>Representatives of Provinces, Cities, and Counties Petition for Exemption from Grain Tax Minister Yu Indicates Willingness to Consider</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Chambers of commerce and grain industries from various provinces, cities, and counties formed a petition delegation to petition for exemption from grain tax. Shou Jingwei served as the head of the delegation. They believed that if the government levied grain tax, it would inevitably stimulate grain prices, causing serious consequences for the people's food supply, and indirectly disturb merchants and civilians. The delegation went to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Food to petition separately. Upon arriving at the Ministry of Finance, Minister Yu personally received them and expressed his willingness to consider the matter of exemption and stated that he would not disappoint the representatives. Chen, a deputy minister of the Ministry of Food, received them and expressed his willingness to assist from the sidelines, hoping that the exemption could continue to be granted, and at the very least, be extended for another year. The representatives scheduled to visit the mausoleum on the morning of the 17th.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Will Not Make a Proposal on the Issue of Expanding Powers; President Zhang Will Make a Verbal Recommendation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The issue of expanding the powers of the Executive Yuan, which was previously raised at the Executive Yuan meeting, is aimed at facilitating the smooth progress of the mobilization and suppression of the rebellion. After this matter was raised at the Executive Yuan meeting, it has not yet been submitted to the State Council. However, it is heard that it will not be made as a proposal, and it is possible that President Zhang Ju will only make a verbal recommendation.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Makes Appropriate Adjustments to the Issuance of Circulation Coupons and Taiwan Dollars; Rational Control of Exchange Rates Between the Two Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Ministry of Finance News: The separate use of Northeast Circulation Coupons and Taiwan Banknotes in Northeast China and Taiwan was originally a temporary measure taken because the economic conditions in these areas, which had been occupied for a longer period of time, were different from those in the mainland, in order to prevent excessive fluctuations in finance and prices in Northeast China and Taiwan. When the time is right, legal tender will still be used to recover them. At present, the order in Taiwan has just been stabilized, and it is not appropriate to change the currency system abruptly. Furthermore, if the exchange rate is stipulated and legal tender is used at the same time, it is due to the fact that Northeast China has relied on materials from within the customs in the past, and military and public personnel need to remit money to support their families, and there is a tendency for speculative funds to flow into the customs, which will cause funds from Northeast China to flow into Pingjin and other places, which will affect finance and prices in Pingjin. The current approach is to make appropriate adjustments to the issuance of Northeast Circulation Coupons and Taiwan Banknotes, and at the same time, to implement reasonable controls on the exchange rates between Northeast China, Taiwan, and the mainland, in order to stabilize finance and prices in Northeast China and Taiwan, and then to plan a unified approach when the time is right.</p>

Establishing the relationship between people, because all people cannot live in isolation from the group, but are social beings. 3.

<h3>Wedemeyer Asks for Assistance in Improving China's Cultural Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 16th, broadcast: Boston News, it is reported that General Wedemeyer expressed his opinion that the United States should assist China in improving its cultural standards so that the Chinese people can gradually embark on the road to political participation.

<h3>U.S. Policy Declaration on China; Secretary Marshall Has Already Drafted and Will Be Released Soon; Congressman Judd, Representative of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Comes to China for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Tokyo, 16th, broadcast: The Chinese delegation announced that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie will come to Tokyo on October 23 on his way back to China and will stay for a few days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Authoritative sources revealed today that Marshall himself is presiding over the review of the future U.S. policy towards China. The reason why he has not yet released the new policy declaration based on Wedemeyer's report to Truman is partly because Marshall's mission at the United Nations General Assembly is too busy. Truman has delegated this task to Marshall. Regarding the policy declaration on China, it will eventually be released.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Republican Congressman Auchincloss said: President Truman should immediately recall MacArthur to consult on U.S. Far East policy matters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Republican Congressman Judd departed today on behalf of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to inspect China, Japan, and Korea. Before his departure, he said: "It is regrettable that the government is keeping the Wedemeyer investigation report a secret, even from Congress. If I could know a thing or two about the contents of the Wedemeyer report, this work would be simpler. No matter what the report says, it is better to release it than to keep silent. I firmly believe that the United States should resist communism in Asia, just as it does in Europe. We are now discussing appropriating $20 billion, most of which will be used to resist communism in Europe, but many people with insight believe that if we want to effectively stop the expansion of the communist party's influence, our concern for Asia should not be less than our concern for Europe."</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington, Judd told reporters that he plans to meet with key American officials and expatriates in China and discuss political and economic issues with senior officials of the Chinese government. He met with President Chiang on his last trip to China and hopes to meet with him again this time.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Resurgence of Japanese Conservative Forces</h3>
<p>The Japanese conservative new party movement, centered on former Prime Minister and Liberal Party President Shigeru Yoshida and Kizokuin President Tsuneo Matsudaira, has been actively underway since early September. It has recently been joined by former Democratic Party leader Shidehara Kijūrō, Chairman of the House of Councillors Foreign Affairs Committee Ken Shōbu Asa, and several members of the House of Councillors, aiming to seize power before the peace conference is convened. This is a noteworthy issue. If the conservative new party is formed, it may not only overthrow the Katayama Cabinet and cause Japanese politics to regress, but it will also have a significant impact on the future peace conference, rendering the aim of the Potsdam Declaration to "establish a government that is inclined towards peace, democracy, and responsibility" unattainable.</p>
<p>After the war, Japan's conservative forces, including Zaibatsu, capitalists, landlords, and bureaucrats, although temporarily impacted by democratic reforms and threatened by the punishment of war crimes, lay dormant. However, after the thorough reforms diminished, the dormant conservative forces became active again. This was largely due to the moderate and lenient policies of the American administration. Last October, some members of the Liberal and Progressive parties proposed the slogan "Strengthening the national foundation, conserving power," but the time was not ripe, and it failed. Recently, due to the sharp antagonism between the US and the Soviet Union and their differing views on the Japanese peace treaty, and on the other hand, the Socialist Party's anti-capitalist stance, implementing the Economic Power Deconcentration Law and coal nationalization to promote moderate social reforms, aroused attacks from capitalists and landlords. Therefore, the conservative forces saw an opportunity and launched this major coalition movement. Yoshida is a typical bureaucrat of the old era. Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno and Council Chairman Hoshijima have long been mainstays of the conservative faction. When the Socialist Party came to power, they secretly allied with Tanaka, the vice-president representing the Shidehara faction of the Democratic Party, and contacted stubborn figures like Matsudaira to prepare for the next step in political activity. Tsuneo Matsudaira is the father-in-law of Emperor Hirohito's brother Prince Chichibu, a prominent figure of the old era, and the current president of the House of Councillors. His leadership of the "Ryokufūkai" group, besides Matsudaira as the leader, includes Naotake Satō, Takudō Uematsu, and Kōsaku Noda as mainstays. They represent the interests of capitalists and landlords in the guise of bureaucrats and use the Ryokufū label to encourage the people's blind faith in the Emperor system. Now they stand on the same front as Shidehara Kijūrō, possessing strong power, background, and support, using a pro-American diplomatic policy for the peace conference as a smokescreen and protecting the old forces and opposing social reforms as their policy. Its growth and activity are undoubtedly a manifestation of the darkness and reaction of Japanese politics and the result of the indulgence and appeasement of the American administrative policy.</p>
<p>Katayama is caught in a dilemma in the face of the growing power of the conservative new party. On the one hand, he stated that the government has the ability to handle the peace conference. On the other hand, he firmly implemented social reforms in an attempt to save the current economic crisis and stabilize his regime. The cabinet meeting on September 29 passed the "Economic Power Deconcentration Law," which includes three key points: restricting personal wealth; restricting economic concentration resulting from agreements and contracts; and restricting the concentration of enterprise productivity and management. This is a necessary step to implement the Allied Headquarters' order to dissolve the Zaibatsu, but the Zaibatsu firmly opposed it. The conservative new party movement is even more determined to fundamentally overturn the Katayama regime by undermining its foundation and setting a new national policy. Then, on October 3, the cabinet meeting passed the "Coal Production Increase Implementation Plan," which includes six points: Coal mine workers should implement a five-day week system of working four days and resting one day instead of a 24-hour, three-shift system; The tax amount for increased income from increased production by workers should be reduced or exempted instead of being subject to progressive taxation; Employment rules should be automatically determined by labor unions; In order to peacefully and quickly resolve labor-management disputes, a "Coal Production Council" should be established; Improve coal mining technology and prioritize the allocation of materials; Stop black market transactions by developing new coal mines to achieve passive production increase. This coal mine state management method, aimed at increasing production and suppressing strikes, is still based on the Allied Headquarters order. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's plan, Japan's coal production can increase to 40 million tons by 1952, with an annual increase of 2-3 million tons. At the beginning of the British Labour Party government, the first bill passed in Parliament was the nationalization of coal mines. In the current Japanese Diet, there is great resistance and many hidden obstacles. It is difficult to judge whether steady social reforms can receive Diet cooperation and support. If it is unfortunately hindered, it will greatly reduce the prestige of the Socialist Party. At that time, will Katayama retreat in the face of difficulties? Or will he throw himself into the arms of the conservative forces? This will be a test of the future of "political democracy" and "economic democracy" in Japan.</p>
<p>Due to the development of the conservative new party movement and the deepening of the Japanese economic crisis, Katayama's environment is much more difficult. In addition, the "Supreme Emperor" above Katayama is not firm about Japan's democratic path and has no determination to dissolve the Zaibatsu, while Ashida Hitoshi of the Democratic Party, a member of the three-party coalition government, is a fence-sitter. Katayama is already in a situation where he cannot clap with one hand. The September issue of the authoritative magazine "Diamond" editorial "Crisis of the Katayama Cabinet," pointed out that the economic crisis cannot be overcome, and the "October crisis" is inevitable. However, Chief Cabinet Secretary Nishio Suehiro replied: "The Katayama Cabinet will definitely not consider reorganization in November" and firmly believed: "Even if the two major bills are not supported, Katayama will still not step down, and will support until after the opening of the peace treaty with Japan." It is difficult for us to know what the Socialist Party relies on for such confidence. In fact, even if the Katayama Cabinet collapses, it will be even more difficult to overcome the Japanese economic crisis. The incompetence of Shidehara and Yoshida has already been tested after the war. Therefore, the "Diamond" magazine also said: "If the Katayama Cabinet collapses, the crisis cannot be solved because of Katayama's dismissal, and even other cabinets cannot avoid it." Why? This is because the American administrative policy has errors, the distance between Japanese political democracy and economic democracy is very far, the Zaibatsu have not been dissolved, capital is still concentrated, war criminals have not been punished, the economy is still weak, and the peaceful people of Japan are still in suffering!</p>
<h3>China's Proposal to Harmonize US and Soviet Opinions</h3>
<p>The second session of the United Nations General Assembly has been open for a full month; however, in these thirty days, we have only seen successive waves of turmoil on Lake Success. Although several issues already on the agenda have been submitted to various committees for discussion, no agreements have been reached. Among them, the most important and eye-catching is the suggestion put forward by the United States representatives to organize a standing committee of fifty-seven countries to meet regularly throughout the year in order to maintain world peace and security. In recent days, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has been discussing this issue. The Soviet representatives have firmly expressed their disagreement, believing that the US's motive in putting forward this suggestion is to circumvent the Security Council, so that the permanent members cannot exercise their veto power. Therefore, this issue has not only become the focus of the dispute between the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union within the United Nations General Assembly, but it has also become the greatest obstacle facing this United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, all countries in the world are paying close attention to the Political Committee's discussion of this issue.</p>
<p>In order to reconcile the views of the US and the Soviet Union, our country's representative Dr. Wellington Koo has put forward a particularly moderate and appropriate solution. According to a report by the Associated Press, the representative stated at the Political Committee meeting on the 15th that China conditionally approves the US suggestion, and believes that if the powers of the standing committee of fifty-seven countries can be clearly defined, on the one hand, not undertaking the main tasks undertaken by the United Nations General Assembly, on the other hand, not infringing on the Security Council's task of maintaining world peace, then the committee will be a useful auxiliary agency to the United Nations General Assembly. As for the conditions he proposed, there are two points: Any international issues and situations within the scope of Articles 11 and 14 of the United Nations Charter must be submitted to the next United Nations General Assembly for discussion before the standing committee of fifty-seven countries can replace the United Nations General Assembly to conduct preliminary research and investigation. The implementation of the resolutions passed by the United Nations General Assembly shall not prohibit any member state from appealing to the Security Council on any issue that is being discussed and studied by the standing committee of fifty-seven countries. Once the Security Council handles the issue, the standing committee must stop the discussion.</p>
<p>If the compromise plan of our country's representative can be accepted by the United Nations General Assembly, then the difficulties faced by the United Nations can be easily solved. The reason why the United States wanted to put forward this suggestion is because the United Nations mechanism is hindered by the veto power. For the international problems that have occurred after the war, no effective solution has been made. In order to strive for the success of the United Nations, Secretary of State Marshall - in his address at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, advocated strictly limiting the exercise of the veto power, and formally suggested to the General Assembly to establish a standing committee of fifty-seven countries to meet regularly throughout the year, specializing in research on issues of world peace and security. However, immediately after Secretary of State Marshall issued this suggestion, it immediately aroused the firm opposition of the Soviet representatives. Soviet Deputy Minister Vyshinsky made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, fiercely criticizing the US's suggestion, and pointed out that the purpose of the United States was to circumvent the Security Council so that the permanent members could not exercise their veto power. Therefore, this proposal is only beneficial to "war-mongers" and so on. If the dispute between the US and the Soviet Union over this issue cannot be resolved and the two sides reach a compromise, then whatever the outcome, whichever side's proposal wins, it will be enough to endanger the existence of the United Nations mechanism.</p>
<p>When the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union were arguing fiercely, there were widespread rumors that the Soviet Union might withdraw from the United Nations mechanism. Even former British Prime Minister Churchill still believes that it is not impossible for the Soviet Union to take this action! Churchill made a radio speech on the 14th, using this as his point, and said: "If the world hopes for peace, even if the Soviet Union withdraws from the United Nations, war will not occur." What's more, the new Communist International has already appeared, and the Soviet Union can use this international organization to engage in anti-American activities and propaganda. Therefore, in order to avoid the Soviet Union withdrawing from the United Nations and causing the world to split into two, the United States should make considerable concessions on this issue. However, from another perspective, the United Nations mechanism has not yet become an effective international organization, and efforts should be made to remedy it. In all fairness, the US suggestion is also one of the plans. If it is abandoned due to Soviet opposition, then the foundation of the United Nations organization is still built on the principle of unanimity among the five great powers. For the international problems that have occurred after the war, it is still impossible to make effective solutions. The result will be that the United Nations mechanism will be nominally existent, and it will still inevitably follow the footsteps of the old League of Nations. Therefore, all countries that love world peace and all countries that advocate upholding the United Nations mechanism as their national policy should try to reconcile the views of the US and the Soviet Union and reach a compromise plan so that the United Nations mechanism will not be nominally existent.</p>
<p>In short, the United Nations mechanism, in the seam of the US-Soviet conflict, has reached the final juncture of life and death. The representatives of various countries currently attending the General Assembly on the shores of Lake Success should use their political wisdom to break the current deadlock and find a way out. The compromise plan of our country's representative Dr. Wellington Koo is worthy of attention from all countries. We also hope that the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union will not act on impulse, but can calmly and carefully study the compromise plan of our country's representative, and, for the sake of the overall situation of the world, should make a wise choice as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>General Assembly of the Money Trade Association</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) The first meeting was held in the afternoon, chaired by Wang Yiqi, with 108 representatives present. Today's meeting consists of reports from representatives from various regions on the business situation of money merchants in their respective regions and their suggestions for improvement. More than ten speakers from Ping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Chongqing, including Liu Zhaoti, Xu Yujing, Hu Shangfu, and Wang Ruobo, mainly said: The business of money merchants has always been based on credit, deeply rooted in the people. Its influence on the people's economic life is deep and significant. However, colleagues in various regions lack communication, making it difficult to promote the development of money merchants. Therefore, the organization of the association is indeed necessary. It is hoped that it can integrate the whole country and assist the government in promoting national policies to prosper trade. In the current period of suppression of rebellion, in order to stabilize finance, the authorities should be requested to issue emergency measures as soon as possible to avoid financial panic. The future business of money merchants should be based on undertakings, not for profit. The publication of money shops across the country and their business plans should be in line with the state's policy of stabilizing finance. Since the imposition of business tax on the money industry after the financial boom turned to decline, colleagues in the banking and money industries in various regions feel that the burden is too heavy, and the government should be requested to reduce the tax rate. After the representatives finished their speeches, the secretariat read the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the telegram of condolence to the soldiers at the front line. All unanimously approved, and then the meeting adjourned. In addition, both morning and afternoon tomorrow will be review meetings.</p>
<p>Chairman's Admonition</p>
<p>Now record Chairman Chiang's admonition as follows: Public and supervisory members of the Money Trade Association of the Republic of China: The money industry has a long history in our country's financial undertakings, and its distribution is also widespread. Since its inception, it has served society, adjusted finances, and achieved many successes. Its adaptability to the environment and convenience to the people have the power to be deeply rooted and universal, and are related to the prosperity of the national economy. The government has promulgated financial laws and regulations, and its expectations for the management and support of the money industry are comprehensive. At a time when we are assisting in suppressing the rebellion, pacifying the people's livelihood, and stabilizing the economy, it is indeed an urgent task. The establishment of the National Money Industry Association at this time should be aware of the importance of its responsibility. All financial measures related to the government, which are published in laws and regulations, should have been deeply recognized and known to follow. It is hoped that it will point out current malpractices and express good plans in order to reverse the crisis of economic decline and benefit the development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce. This is what is deeply hoped for, Kai-shek.</p>
<h3>Orphans Donate Flag to the Young Women's Christian Association</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) At the beginning of the conference on the 16th, four young girls, representing the Zhejiang Provincial Orphanage, presented a silk banner with the inscription "Benefiting the World" and delivered a speech, roughly stating that the Young Women's Christian Association has spared no effort in its work for children's welfare in the past, and they have benefited greatly from it. They hereby express their gratitude on behalf of all the children, etc. All the representatives present were deeply moved.</p>
<p>Talks by Korean Representative</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 16th, the reporter went to the Hotel des Colonies to visit Mrs. Kim, the Korean representative attending the conference, and asked about her struggles during Japanese rule. She said: The various cruel and painful experiences in the past are indeed indescribable. In short, the people had absolutely no freedom. The Young Women's Christian Association was a social and religious organization, so it was subjected to strict surveillance. In 1939, it was forced to disband, and all activities were completely suspended. Countless underground comrades were killed. Mrs. Kim was originally a professor of religion at a Korean senior college, but was forced to lose her job after the religious subjects were cancelled. After the victory, she specialized in organizing the Young Women's Christian Association and developed activities. However, international religious activities are still prohibited in the north under Soviet control. Currently, the northern and southern parts of Korea are completely separated, and even correspondence is subject to inspection. There are still many cases of family members being unable to reunite, so all Koreans long for the peaceful reunification of the country to arrive soon.</p>
<p>Improved Status of Women</p>
<p>According to Mrs. Kim, the status of Korean women has generally improved after the war. Nowadays, many married women go out to work, and their husbands are not allowed to interfere. There are special departments in government agencies to discuss the conduct of women's welfare affairs. At the end of this year, Korea will hold the first general election, and women also have the right to vote, equal to men.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Gold in Taiwan Case</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) According to reports, in October 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Evans served as the leader of the US military liaison group and arrived in Taipei with our dispatched forward command post. He took advantage of his position to receive a box of "Fu" character gold ingots from Japanese Major Harada, a total of 4,000 ingots, each weighing one tael, but only 2,000 ingots (ie 2,000 taels) were delivered to the Taiwan Provincial Government, while the other 2,000 ingots (ie 2,000 taels) were misappropriated. Harada was an officer of the Japanese military accounting office. At that time, the Taiwanese youth Huang Zairong, who was working as a translator, was aware of this. Through Huang Zairong's introduction, Evans met his younger brother Huang Zaiyi, who was doing business in Shanghai, and privately shipped the gold ingots to Shanghai in batches in November of the same year, selling a total of 1,921 taels, exchanging for US$107,967. Huang Zaiyi received a commission of US$706 and 466,000 French francs. There were also 79 gold ingots, whose whereabouts are unknown. It is rumored that Evans took them back to the United States. When the case was discovered last year, Evans, who had returned to the United States, had retired. He was subsequently arrested. The US side opened a court investigation in the spring of this year. The Taiwan Provincial Government sent officials Wu Songgong, Xia Zhizhi, and Ma Xian to Los Angeles to testify. Huang Zaiyi and Japanese Harada, as well as another US Army Captain Aronson, involved in another case, also appeared in court and were subsequently indicted.</p>
<h3>Chiang Monlin's Remarks in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) In addition to Indonesia, Annam, and Japan, all other countries in the Eastern Conference were represented. During the conference, opinions were widely exchanged on various issues such as the industry, economy, culture, education, and democracy of various countries. Regarding the Japanese issue, the representatives of various countries generally felt the importance of re-education work. As for China's domestic politics, it was not discussed. Since the conference was limited to exchanging opinions, there were no resolutions. Therefore, after recording all the opinions, they were only for reference by various countries. Chiang said: During his stay in the UK, he inspected all aspects of British society and deeply felt that the current economic situation in the UK is indeed very serious. At present, at least 10 million people in the UK rely on imports from abroad for their food. Pork is extremely rare in the market, and even eggs have disappeared. Therefore, the British government's control over materials is even stricter than during the war. On the one hand, the people's needs are all rationed, and even the King and the Prime Minister are no exception. On the other hand, the government forces all materials to be sold to prevent national accumulation. A friend of mine raises pigs at home, but he is not allowed to eat them himself, and the eggs laid must also be sold publicly in the market. Although materials are scarce in the UK, there is no black market. This is because the British are accustomed to abiding by the law, and are willing to endure personal hardship rather than increase the country's difficulties. This spirit is worthy of our admiration and learning. Finally, Chiang denied the rumor that he would be appointed Secretary-General of Guangdong Province.</p>
<h3>Kawashima Yoshiko Persistently Makes Excuses</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) A temporary court was set up on the 16th in the prison. Because the location was not announced in the newspapers beforehand, there were few spectators. Mayor He also came to watch. Presiding Judge Wu Shengjiu, Prosecutor Jia Cequan, etc. began the court session at 1:30 pm. Kawashima, wearing a gray prison uniform, walked in under the mercury lamp. She first bowed to her three defenders, and then answered questions from the court, claiming to be 33 years old, of Japanese nationality, and from Beiping.</p>
<p>Enumerating the Charges</p>
<p>The prosecutor enumerated the charges, saying that the defendant was born in China and there was no question about her nationality. Because she was a descendant of the late Qing Dynasty, she had the idea of restoring the Manchu Qing Dynasty. The defendant had various conditions for working as a spy, such as driving airplanes and cars, riding horses, swimming, dancing, photography, and mastering English, French, Chinese, and Japanese languages. Moreover, she was over 30 years old and still unmarried, and traveled between Japan and various important places, which shows that she had espionage activities. However, because her skills were superb, it was difficult to obtain evidence. This is also the reason why she denied everything. The focus of this case should be that the defendant had attempted to send the puppet Manchu imperial relics to Rehe and tried to form the "Dingguo Army." Although she used the Japanese, she handed over South China to Wang Jingwei and North China to Zhu Shen. Referring to the defendant's confession in the Beiping Execution Supervisory Office, it can be proved that she is a traitor.</p>
<p>Specious Defense</p>
<p>After that, the court conducted the interrogation one by one, or ordered her to state her case. Kawashima denied almost all the points in the confession, saying that it was a "novel" written to Li Zongren after being deceived and ordered to do so, and repeatedly said: "I can accept such a shooting, but except for the crime of being a traitor, I dare to say in front of the portrait of the Father of the Nation that I have not done anything to harm China." She also said: "I returned to China at the age of sixteen because I knew I was Chinese and came to see my motherland." She said: "The Father of the Nation also hoped for Sino-Japanese friendship. If you say I am a traitor, please bring evidence." Kawashima had high eloquence. She looked innocent, but in fact her words were very sharp and did not leak any flaws. Kawashima claimed: "The Japanese wanted to use me, but I was not used. This is not a crime!"</p>
<p>Denying Everything</p>
<p>Kawashima denied that she had been a dancer in Shanghai and worked as a spy, denied that she had attempted to restore the Manchu Qing Dynasty and form the "Dingguo Army," and denied that she had rebelled against Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen, saying that it was done by her brother Shengdong. She also said that she had never participated in the puppet Manchu affairs. She said earlier that Terauchi had forced Honjo Shigeru to send troops with a pistol, which she learned from Japanese books. Regarding her visit to Wang Jingwei in Japan and asking him if he had any contact with Chiang Kai-shek, she said that she was not in Japan at that time. She said that she was shot because she was afraid that the Japanese would bomb the Forbidden City, so she asked Konoe for help and shot herself in anger. She said that wearing the general's uniform was just a momentary curiosity, and she would not wear it again in the future.</p>
<p>Disrespecting the Judge</p>
<p>Finally, she said: "The lawsuit cannot be fought. I have no money and cannot give bribes to the judge. If anything happens again, I will definitely run away with the judges." Her three defenders pleaded, asking the court to pay attention to the evidence, and that the indictment against Kawashima was mostly imaginative, and should not be recognized as evidence of a crime because of Kawashima's mysterious and dramatic face. Before leaving the court, Kawashima asked the prosecutor "What's your surname?" She said: I hope you can change the way you handle other cases in the future.</p>
<h3>Political Party Nomination Candidate Quota Issue Shelved, Supervisory Yuan Discusses Supervisory Committee Election Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 16th] The issue of allocating quotas for the three parties nominating candidates for the general election has not yet been agreed upon. The Democratic Socialist Party insists on not submitting a list until the quota issue is resolved. Although the Youth Party has already submitted a list of candidates for the National Assembly, it has not yet submitted a list of candidates for legislators. The Central Election Guidance Committee of the Kuomintang held a meeting on the 16th to thoroughly discuss issues such as political party nominations and the principles for reviewing party members participating in elections. According to Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party, who returned to Nanjing from Shanghai today, the quota determined by the party's Central Standing Committee is actually the "minimum" number. The standard for this number is based on the current domestic environment and the party's internal assessment of how many people can be found who are qualified to serve as representatives or legislators. When asked by reporters whether this quota was absolutely unchangeable, he replied that it would depend on the degree of mutual concession between the two parties (referring to the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party). Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party told reporters that the so-called candidate quota is not the number of elected people. The constitution stipulates that a two-thirds majority is required to amend it. We hope that the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and non-party individuals will account for at least one-third of the total number.</p>
<p>[This newspaper Nanjing, 16th] The Central Election Guidance Committee of the Kuomintang held a meeting on the morning of the 16th to review the list of candidates for the National Assembly from various provinces, cities, and districts of the party. Wu Tiecheng chaired the meeting to discuss review methods and the issue of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties participating in the election. Zhang Shusheng, the Chief Commissioner of the election, told reporters today that he especially emphasized the determination to assist friendly parties in participating in the election. It is also learned that, based on the principle of cooperation with the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, the Kuomintang will cede some areas to the two parties separately. It is also learned that the Election Guidance Committee will hold closed-door meetings daily starting from the 17th and will complete its task after the internal list review is completed.</p>
<p>[This newspaper Nanjing, 16th] The Supervisory Yuan held a symposium on the morning of the 16th to discuss the election of supervisory committee members. During the meeting, the proposal by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties to allow the provincial, municipal, and county councils to participate in the selection of candidates was reviewed. Several supervisory committee members were also appointed to study the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution and the organizational law of the provincial, county, and municipal councils, and to present their findings at the next symposium. Also on the 16th, the meeting exchanged views on the issue of free transportation for executive and supervisory personnel of various parties.</p>
<h3>The Academia Sinica Council Holds Group Review Meetings, Candidate List May Be Decided Today</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Nanjing, 16th] The Academia Sinica Council held review meetings in three groups on the morning of the 16th. The mathematics and physics group was convened by Li Shuhua, the biology group was convened by Chen Zhida, and the humanities group was convened by Hu Shi. A general meeting was held at 3:00 PM to discuss and synthesize the review results of the groups. The list of candidates for the mathematics and physics group has been largely reviewed. The review of the biology and humanities groups will continue on the 17th, and the entire list can be completely decided at the general meeting on the 17th. It is reported that the review is based on two qualifications: "works" and "service achievements," and is extremely detailed, with much debate, especially on establishing principles and standards. The principle for this year's election of academicians is to select 80 people. Therefore, the total number of candidates passed by the three groups tomorrow will be one times the number of academicians, that is, 160 people, and will not exceed 200 people at most. The council believes that there is a regret, that is, according to the election rules, the nomination of academicians in this session is somewhat mechanical. Others are nominated, but self-nomination is inconvenient. For example, the council itself should have five people, who have given up this time. By analogy, judging from the current situation of Chinese academia, there are omissions. This should be taken into account and added to the second session next year. At noon on the 16th, Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet to entertain all members of the council. Minister Zhu will host a banquet on the afternoon of the 17th.</p>
<h3>Four US Congressmen Arrive in Nanjing, Visit Foreign Minister Yu to Inquire About Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Nanjing, 16th] Four members of the U.S. House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, including Congressman Hall, and Major Taylor, arrived in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 16th. They immediately went to the Ministry of Communications to visit Minister Yu Dawei and Mr. Siffin Suo, inquiring about the current situation of civil aviation in China, and hoping that the commerce between China and the United States can rely on air transport for substantial development in the future. At 11:00 AM, they visited Vice Minister Liu Shishun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and were accompanied by Mr. Liu to meet with Premier Zhang at the Executive Yuan. At noon, Ambassador Stuart hosted a banquet to entertain them. At 2:00 PM, they flew to Tianjin on the same plane. Mr. Hale B. was borrowing to leave. It is reported that the mission of their trip is to visit American overseas businessmen in various places to understand the current situation of Sino-American commerce, and then return to their country via South Korea and Japan in order to make greater progress in Far East trade.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Rice Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>(This newspaper Fuzhou, 16th) Rice prices here have been rising sharply. Yesterday, they were sold for 760,000 yuan. Today, due to a drop in yarn prices, they have fallen back by 50,000 yuan. At a time when rice and grain are abundant, the price of grain is so high, which is causing public outrage. The municipal government has specifically ordered the police bureau to investigate and crack down. The Provincial Agricultural and Food Administration will allocate 3,000 dan of affordable rice from today, to be sold to the common people at 450,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Hankou and Changsha Rice Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Hankou, 16th] Grain prices here continue to rise, and top-quality machine-milled rice has already hit the 500,000 yuan mark. In addition, credit is tight, and the Shanghai exchange rate discount has reached 180 yuan per 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[This newspaper Changsha, 16th] Rice prices have skyrocketed, once reaching a peak of 450,000 yuan. Everyone is asking why the prices continue to rise in a straight line after the comprehensive ban on transportation. According to people familiar with the situation, grain from the lakeside area is directly transported downstream at high prices, causing a shortage of rice in Changsha. The Ministry of Food has entrusted the purchase of 3.6 million dan in Changsha. The Wuhan Xingyuan is purchasing military grain in Hunan. The Hubei Agricultural and Food Administration is unable to repay its debts to the central government and is purchasing grain in large quantities in Hunan. Grain smuggling is rampant, and the government cannot prohibit it. It is said that after the autumn harvest in previous years, the Changsha granaries could store a minimum of 7 million shi of grain, but this year, apart from military grain, there is currently no grain left, resulting in a food shortage. (More price news can be found on page 5)</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Commodity Prices Tend to Stabilize</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Zhenjiang, 16th] Commodity prices in Zhenjiang have stabilized yesterday and today, but top-quality rice is still sold for 540,000 yuan per shi, soybean oil is 22,000 yuan per catty, cotton cloth is falling with the Shanghai market, and cigarettes continue to rise.</p>

<h3>First Visit to Yantai (Part Two)</h3>
<p>--Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>National Army Enters Yantai Without Firing a Single Shot</p>
<p>There are many rumors, and I don't know where they come from. If you are not careful, you will be misled by them. In fact, the National Army did not fire a single shot when entering Yantai. The battle ended early at Mount Zhifu and Shuiman Tou (the outer barriers of Yantai), so the urban area was not baptized by artillery fire, otherwise it would definitely not be the way it is now. Coming to Yantai will remind people of the warlords of several generations, including Chu Yupu, Liu Zhennian, Zhang Zongchang, and Han Fuqu. A middle-aged Yantai man has never stopped hearing gunshots since his elementary school days. The buildings in Yantai are well-preserved, and the streets and alleys are all concrete pavements, which are relics of the Liu Zhennian era. However, the port is not very good. Ships have no docks to rely on and must be transferred by small sampans. Shandong entrepreneurs once attempted to build the Yantai-Weihai Railway in order to make Yantai's position replace Qingdao, but the result was blocked by Japanese imperialism. In fact, the commercial port value of Yantai is far above Qingdao. In terms of water transportation, it is close to all ports in the Bohai Sea, and the direct connection to the south is only ten hours more than Qingdao. The most important difference is that Yantai has products, while Qingdao does not. Yantai's products include five major categories: aquatic vegetables, lace, hairnets, pork, and fruit wine. The absorption of foreign exchange accounts for an important proportion of the country. Among the aquatic vegetables, the apples, pears, and grapes are just coming onto the market in the autumn. In recent years, because there has been no rotation, many fruit trees have been cut down. The scale of the orchards reminds people of the western United States. Yantai has only been opened for several decades. Every Yantai person around the age of fifty has witnessed the construction of buildings and the flourishing of orchards. Although Yantai is currently scarce and difficult, the fragrance of apples still permeates everywhere. Vendors carrying poles on their shoulders shout on the streets "Fifteen coppers a catty," which is what the locals no longer care about, but the people in the south consider a treasure.</p>
<p>"Three-Dynasty Veteran" Still Serves as President</p>
<p>In Yantai, there is no shortage of "three-dynasty veterans." For example, the famous Zhang Yu Winery produces 100 to 200 cases of grape wine and brandy per day. Zhang Yuchang, the father of this old man, was originally a worker, but when it passed to his nephew, he became a complete capitalist. Zhang Yu Winery has been shut down for ten years, and the old man has run away. The machines are still there and have not been damaged at all, so the municipal government sealed it as public property. Another is the president of the Chamber of Commerce, who is still serving as president, assisting the municipal government in restoring order. The port is still under the management of the Navy and should return to normal within the expiry date. In the past, Yantai Port was a place where foreign fleets came to escape the summer heat. The merchants could not help but yearn for the "prosperity" of more than ten years ago. As soon as they saw American sailors landing, they quickly wrote out English signs and planned bars and dance halls. According to the Navy, the American cruiser, Erdaosi, was not allowed to enter the port, only allowed them to land for sightseeing, and the ship gave them three days off, accompanied by Chinese personnel to tour Yantai. I don't know if they will be able to enter and exit freely in the future.</p>
<p>Mayor Ding Fu Ting Looks Like Feng Yuxiang</p>
<p>Finally, I will introduce the current mayor, Ding Futing, a native of Muping, Shandong, 51 years old, who looks like Feng Yuxiang, but is less tall. He graduated from the Northeast Military Academy and the Northeast Police Academy. He served as a staff officer in the Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Office and participated in the Great Wall War of Resistance. At that time, he was a brigade commander and commanded the battle at Xifengkou, where he was besieged by the enemy. During the Anti-Japanese War, he fought guerrillas in eastern Shandong. Just like Qingdao Mayor Li Xianliang, people forgot his original education and experience and liked to call him "born from guerrilla warfare" (Sent from Yantai on the 11th) (End)</p>
<p>Qingdao US Consulate Officials Praise the Discipline of the National Army</p>
<p>[United Press Qingdao, 16th] U.S. consular officials recently returned from an inspection in Yantai. According to what they told a United Press reporter, the situation in Yantai has quickly returned to normal two weeks after the National Army recovered it. The 25th Division of the National Army first entered the city on October 1. They were in high spirits and had excellent discipline, paying the value for shopping. Therefore, the people welcomed them and wholeheartedly assisted in building fortifications. American property in Yantai, such as Mobil Oil's oil depot and the residences of missionaries, suffered heavy damage, but not due to the war, but because of looting by bandits, who removed all the wood. The consulate's archives are intact and have been taken back to Qingdao. There are no plans to reopen the Yantai consulate. According to a Chinese merchant, he told an American missionary: We people were living in darkness under the Communist Party's rule, and now we have seen the light of day again. The Chinese people's feelings towards the Communist rulers can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>European Crisis Affects US Security, Marshall Urges Aid to Europe, Demands Immediate Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] New York, 16th Radio: Washington News, President Truman announced at a press conference today that the government has achieved considerable success in providing temporary aid to France, but convening a special session of Congress to help Europe solve the economic crisis this winter may still be necessary. At present, he is trying his best to obtain the aid to Europe to avoid all the troubles of convening a special session of Congress. Truman's tone has been the most optimistic today compared to the past few weeks. He also said that the report by Interior Secretary Krug on investigating domestic resources to seek large-scale aid will be released in the coming days. Regarding the proposal for the United States to take over the British military district in Germany, Truman said that no decision has been made yet. When asked about the President's opinion on Wallace's critical remarks, he refused to answer.</p>
<p>[Reuters Boston, 15th] Secretary of State Marshall said in a speech to the American Federation of Labor here today that there is a need for the United States to engage in emergency relief to prevent the collapse of Europe before the United States Congress can take action on a long-term aid plan to Europe. Secretary Marshall said: We are already facing the danger that the characteristics of Western civilization, which our government and way of life are based on, will disappear. We must adopt active transitional measures to prevent the fatal deterioration of Europe's political, economic, and psychological state before Congress has sufficient time to consider and act on a long-term aid plan. The current grain conservation plan is one of these transitional measures. The Congressional Committee, which is scheduled to meet in November, will undoubtedly consider other measures. At the same time, the U.S. government should also do its best to provide assistance. However, this is only an important step to prevent collapse this winter. Secretary Marshall then outlined the basic principles of U.S. foreign policy in the current world situation, saying that "The basic question today is whether people are allowed to freely organize their society, politics, and economic survival according to their wishes, or whether their lives will be left to the control of a very small number of people. In today's world, the seriousness of this question has exceeded the extent of the past. Although the theory of suppressing or even eliminating human freedom differs from era to era, these theories all have a most serious fallacy, that is, in human affairs, no means can be spared to achieve their goals. "Secretary Marshall then described the history of the "Marshall Plan" after he first reported the aid proposal at Harvard University in June. He said: We have now reached the stage where sixteen European countries have submitted preliminary reports. Several committees of Congress plan to convene meetings in a few weeks to review the priority measures of immediate need, and then the government will put forward a plan for long-term reconstruction and reconciliation in Europe. Regardless of the form of this plan, we can be sure that the participating countries will make every possible effort to achieve their self-determined production goals and financial reforms. These countries all need extreme perseverance. Basically speaking, the current problem of world recovery is actually a production problem. The American people should know that increasing production requires more diligent work, and the latter requires food. The production of American farms and factories has an extremely significant impact on the whole world. The United States is now in a world of extreme crisis, and this situation contains great danger. Every American people should realize that those who think that the United States can maintain a detached position in the crisis are fools. The economic stability of Europe is a necessary condition for its political stability. Therefore, it has an extremely significant impact on the peace and security of the United States, and even the peace and security of the entire world. We are facing the danger that the characteristics of Western civilization will be eliminated, and our government and way of life are based on this characteristic of Western civilization."</p>
<h3>Foreigners' Assets in the U.S. Total 1 Billion Yuan, U.S. Government Considers Requisition, Plans to Use it for Emergency Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 15th] According to U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett today, the Marshall Plan will be formally submitted to the Congressional Committee on November 10 for decision. Lovett emphasized that the United States, under the current circumstances, has made its best efforts to help European countries get through this winter.</p>
<p>France and Italy's assets in the United States that can be used are not enough to cope with their dollar panic. It is estimated that the funds needed to help these countries get through the winter until the end of March next year will be 100 million or 200 million yuan more than the 585 million yuan in temporary assistance proposed by President Truman. Lovett continued: The U.S. government is studying the legal issues of requisitioning foreigners' assets in the U.S. to assist the European aid plan. On this point, the State Department has not asked private banks to announce the number of foreign accounts. As for whether it is planning to take this kind of step, he declined to answer. France has asked the government agencies concerned to study its citizens' property in the United States. It is said that the Department of Justice is studying the legal issues of using European people's loans in the U.S. to support public bonds issued by the Export-Import Bank. It is generally believed that it is a legal measure to support public bonds issued by the Export-Import Bank with nearly 1 billion US dollars of foreign property under the control of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.</p>
<h3>31 German Ships, the U.S. Will Give to France</h3>
<p>Bidault Optimistic About the Aid to Europe Plan</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] New York, 16th Radio: In order to support the French government, which is being coerced by the Communist Party, the United States is currently trying to provide it with economic and material assistance. It is rumored that the United States plans to give France 31 ships obtained from the German Navy to improve France's maritime transport work.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 15th] It is reported that Bidault has assured his cabinet members in today's cabinet meeting that the temporary aid that the United States has promised to give to France is sufficient for France to maintain itself until the Marshall Plan is implemented.</p>
<h3>Emergency Aid to Europe Plan Does Not Include the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 15th] Government officials said that ensuring the remaining portion of the unfrozen U.S. dollar loan or ensuring that the Marshall Plan is implemented before June next year cannot prevent the United Kingdom from continuing to substantially reduce its purchases with U.S. dollars and intensifying its reduction in purchases from the U.S. dollar trading area. The United Kingdom cannot request temporary assistance before the Marshall Plan is discussed.</p>
<h3>Western European Countries Need Huge Amounts of Aid, the U.S. Demands Further Cuts, Which Will Cause Subtle Diplomatic Problems</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 15th] Senior State Department officials planning the Marshall Plan said that they believe that the European countries participating in the plan may not be able to reduce their demands to the point that the United States considers "reasonable," otherwise the U.S. government will have to weaken them on their behalf. They said: The only question is who will be responsible for the reduction work. This move involves subtle diplomatic and political issues, because the Executive Committee of the Sixteen European Countries Meeting is currently visiting the United States. They have said that if they are responsible for actually reducing the numbers, they will not be able to achieve the desired recovery process, and the responsibility for the failure will be borne by them.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources in the government privately said that the Marshall Plan will be drastically reduced when it is submitted to Congress. Senior U.S. officials said that they dare not directly tell European Chief Representative Sir Franks and his colleagues this attitude, lest they be disappointed and return home. However, the United States and Europe unanimously believe that there is no need to hold the Paris Lun Conference, and that the necessary corrections will be made in the current meeting. Both parties believe that sending the plan back to Europe for reconsideration is tantamount to its death knell.</p>

<h3>Seven Countries of the Arab Group Sign a Military Mutual Assistance Treaty, Requesting Trusteeship of Italian-controlled Libya</h3>
<p>[Reuters Beirut, 15th] The Arab League Steering Committee has ended its eight-day secret meeting at the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the meeting, the Arab countries reiterated their determination to engage in military cooperation based on the principles of mutual assistance and self-defense. League Secretary-General Azzam claimed that the military treaty that the Arab countries can establish is the greatest achievement of the League since its establishment in 1944. The recognition of military cooperation as a basic element of the Arab world is a first in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, the newly resigned financial expert of the U.S. Special Administrative Region, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen have formed a military cooperation agreement for the first time, and the Palestinian issue is the motive. Azzam also revealed that in today's League meeting, a memorandum to the four major powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France has been drafted, requesting that the Arab countries be allowed to participate in the international committee scheduled to discuss the issue of Libya in North Africa next month. If the Arab countries are elected to govern Libya under trusteeship, Egypt is the most likely to be elected.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Clayton's Resignation: Disagreement with Secretary Marshall</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Observers here believe that Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Clayton's resignation is due to differences of opinion with Secretary of State Marshall regarding the imperial trade preference system. Clayton insisted that Britain must abandon its imperial trade preference system as a condition for participating in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery, while Marshall believed that the recovery of Europe should not be hindered solely by attacks on the principle of the trade preference system. Threatening not to allow Britain to participate in the European aid plan and demanding that Britain abandon its imperial trade preference system would inevitably be a poor political stance and difficult to reconcile with European recovery and American principles. According to reports from Washington, when the Anglo-American tariff negotiations entered a serious stage last week, British Ambassador to the United States Lord Inverchapel bypassed Clayton and directly contacted Marshall. This meeting was a key turning point in the Anglo-American tariff negotiations and one of the reasons for Clayton's resignation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Declares No Compromise with Communists</h3>
<p>Hoping for Opposition Party Cooperation in Preparing for Peace Conference [New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Prime Minister Katayama, attending the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on the 16th, stated the Japanese government's views on the Japanese peace conference, saying: Japan must prepare two things for the peace conference: first, based on the Potsdam Declaration and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, to complete the democratization of all sectors of Japanese domestic politics, economy, culture, and society. The current government's various measures are all based on this line; second, to prepare for the full delegation to attend the peace conference, to complete the national burden, hoping that the opposition parties will cooperate and send representatives to participate. Prime Minister Katayama then discussed Japan's position after the establishment of the Communist International organization, saying: "So-called permanent neutrality does not have this power internationally. Japan, which has renounced war, hopes to quickly join international organizations and ensure security. However, because all countries experienced hardships during World War II, a third world war is thought to be avoidable. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party have broken off relations, so there will be no compromise with the Communist Party, nor will it be influenced by the Communist International organization."</p>

<h3>Before Holy Land Gains Full Independence, It Should Be Placed Under UN Trusteeship; Syria and Iraq Propose</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] Syria and Iraq each submitted resolutions to the General Assembly today, requesting that Britain place the Holy Land under UN trusteeship before Palestine gains full independence, and that several legal points of the Palestinian issue be submitted to the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>The Syrian resolution asks the General Assembly to recognize that Palestine is a mandated territory and that its independence has been temporarily recognized by the League of Nations covenant. The General Assembly's proposals on Palestine should only be limited to the provisions of Chapter XII of the Charter regarding trusteeship. Britain has not yet established the necessary institutions for a self-governing government in Palestine, enabling the Palestinian government to fulfill its responsibilities in accordance with the mandate law. In order to establish such governmental institutions, efforts should be made during the transition period between the end of the mandate and the establishment of an independent Palestinian government. Therefore, Syria requests that the General Assembly advise Britain to prepare an agreement under Article 79 of the Charter as soon as possible and submit it to the General Assembly for approval, so that Britain can complete its mission in Palestine during the transition period, engaging in establishing a sovereign Palestinian state with a democratic foundation, and electing a constituent assembly as soon as possible. The constituent assembly should formulate a constitution to protect the basic freedoms and rights of all minorities and protect the Holy Land. A government should be established within a certain period to take over administrative power. The Iraqi resolution asks the General Assembly to recognize that partition conflicts with the right of the majority people to choose a government and Britain's guarantees to the Arabs in 1915 and 1916.</p>

<h3>Arab Group Plans to Organize Middle East Committee: Refuses to Participate in Far East Commission</h3>

<h3>Commander Xuan Submits Opinion Letter to Mayor Wu: Food and Cloth to be Operated Publicly, Avoiding Exploitation by Intermediaries and Eliminating Monopoly; Universal Inspection of Hoarded Goods in All Districts</h3>
<p>Police Commander Xuan Tiewu, on the afternoon of the 16th, formally submitted to Mayor Wu an opinion letter on the public operation of food and cloth and the universal inspection of hoarding. The opinion letter is divided into two points: For the people's needs for food and clothing, namely food (including oil) and cloth, the municipal government is requested to immediately organize public operation to avoid exploitation by intermediaries and eliminate the hoarding and monopoly. Shanghai does not lack materials and has enough for the people's needs. The reason why people feel there is a shortage is all due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding. The Shanghai area is vast, and the hoarded goods are either piled up in scattered warehouses or dispersed into retail, making inspection difficult. The Garrison Headquarters is now determined to universally inspect hoarded goods (including all daily necessities) in all districts, not limited to warehouses. Houses suspected of hoarding will be inspected, and all goods found will be supplied to the market at reasonable prices. A spokesman for the Garrison Headquarters stated that if the above opinion is approved, the Garrison Headquarters will fully assist the municipal government in thoroughly implementing it.</p>

<h3>Four Principles for Random Inspection of Textile Mills: Production Certificates Required During Inspection, Main Target is Hoarding</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau considers the responsibility of random inspection of textile mills to be significant. After consulting with Tan Yili, the inspector stationed at the bureau from the Textile Adjustment Committee, four key points for the inspection were agreed upon: When each inspection team departs, they should hold a production certificate to conduct the inspection on the designated manufacturer. Inspections without a certificate are not allowed. When the manufacturer's account books are brought to the bureau, they should be immediately sent to the commissioner of the Textile Adjustment Committee stationed at the bureau for review and countersignature. Each team should sign and report the investigation situation every day before 5:00 pm for further review and instructions. The main target of the random inspection is hoarding for profit. These measures have been approved and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Treacherous Merchants Move Rice to Suburbs</p>
<p>[Another Report] It is expected that yesterday, the inspection of the Gu Da Textile Mill will continue together with the Textile Adjustment Committee, and strict monitoring of transactions in various markets will continue.

In the future, if citizens see treacherous merchants dividing up hoarded rice and attempting to hide it, they should immediately report it. They will be severely dealt with in accordance with Article 18, Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 of the Measures for the Prohibition of Hoarding Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times.</p>

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau convened a preliminary research meeting of relevant agencies at 3:00 pm yesterday. After discussion, they agreed on the principle, but believed that when applying the formula, local competent authorities must have detailed statistics as a basis on a technical level. This automatic adjustment method is practical rather than theoretical. Therefore, it needs to be practical so that neither the company nor the people suffer. The detailed calculation method of this method will be discussed and decided at the second meeting next week after the members of each department return and study it, and then the opinions will be submitted to the National Economic Commission for approval.</p>

<h3>Automobile Fuel Rationing Issue: Decision Awaits Compilation of Data</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of automobile fuel rationing in the city, the Municipal Council previously decided on a method stipulating that each vehicle can refuel at most once every three days, with a maximum of 10 gallons for small cars and 30 gallons for large trucks each time. After the implementation of this method, some vehicles were insufficient due to the different nature of each vehicle, and others had surpluses. The Automobile Fuel Rationing Review Committee convened a meeting at the Public Utilities Bureau the day before yesterday and decided to divide small cars and trucks into three levels, large, medium, and small, according to tonnage, and allocate fuel according to actual needs. More fuel will be allocated to commercial rental cars, and less fuel will be allocated to private small cars that do not need 100 gallons per month.

<h3>Evicting Tenants, Coffins Brought to the Door: May 30th Hosiery Factory Accuses Landlord of Obstructing Business and Infringing Freedom</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Tang Yurang, a native of Funing, rented two rooms downstairs at No. 190-192 Wuzhou Road from Sun Huayin, who resided at No. 338 Kulun Road, on September 24th of last year. He opened the May 30th Hosiery Factory, stipulating a one-year lease, which expired on September 24th of this year. Tang, citing excessive decoration costs, requested a renewal of the lease, but Sun firmly refused. The two sides were deadlocked. On the 4th of this month, Sun, along with his concubine Sun Fangshi, his son Sun Shuihe, and dozens of other men and women, brought eight coffins and piled them inside the May 30th Hosiery Factory, obstructing its business. Tang Yurang reported this to the police, requesting that Sun and others remove the coffins, but the police stated that this was a civil dispute and were unwilling to intervene. Upon hearing this, Sun and others intensified their actions, adding three more coffins the next morning, completely filling the May 30th store. They also moved in an old wooden commode that Sun Huayin's ninety-year-old mother had used for decades, drawing onlookers and blocking the road. Tang Yurang, claiming that Sun was obstructing his business, filed a lawsuit with the local court against Sun Huayin, Sun Fangshi, and Sun Shuihe for the crime of infringing freedom and demanded that they be ordered to remove the coffins. The case was heard yesterday morning in the First Criminal Court by Judge Shen Dabao. The defendant, Sun Huayin, admitted without hesitation to carrying the coffins into the May 30th store. When asked in court where he got so many coffins, Sun replied, "I am the owner of a coffin shop. I want to take back the house downstairs on Wuzhou Road for my own use, but the plaintiff refuses to move out, so I brought the coffins there." Subsequently, the plaintiff, Tang Yurang, stated that although the lease had expired, he had requested to renew it. The defendant did not give notice but instead moved in coffins and commodes, obstructing his business, which was unreasonable. The court concluded the debate on the case and scheduled the verdict for the 21st.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Police Officer Shot and Killed: Prosecutor Goes to Nanhui for Autopsy</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Li Longfu, a member of the Shanghai County Government Criminal Police Team, led two soldiers on official business to Nanhui County on the 12th of this month. They were dressed in plain clothes and carried two rifles. When they passed through Sanlinchang in Pudong and entered the territory of Nanhui County, the Nanhui County Self-Defense Force stopped them for questioning. A dispute arose, and the Self-Defense Force fired two shots, killing Li Longfu. The two soldiers accompanying him turned and fled. The Self-Defense Force reported to the Nanhui County Government that Li was a bandit attempting robbery and had been killed on the spot. The deceased's wife, Li Lian, filed a lawsuit with the local procuratorate, claiming that the Nanhui County Self-Defense Force had brutally murdered Li and robbed him of two rifles, a gold ring, and legal tender. She requested an autopsy and investigation. Yesterday, the local procuratorate sent Prosecutor Quan Tao to the countryside of Nanhui to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased had been killed by two gunshot wounds sustained before death. The case will soon summon relevant parties for investigation to determine the truth.</p>

<h3>Xiao Dangui's Coffin Surrounded: 50,000 Fans Crowd Paradise to See the Famous Actress's Last Moments</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The body of Yue Opera star Xiao Dangui was placed in a coffin at the Paradise Funeral Home yesterday. Daxi Road underwent a transformation from its usual quiet and desolate state, with people flocking to Paradise from 8:00 am onwards. By the afternoon, the crowd grew larger and larger, causing severe congestion from the Jiangsu Road intersection to inside the funeral hall, creating a "grand occasion" unseen in over a decade since Ruan Lingyu's passing. When Yuan Xuefen, Zhu Shuizhao, Xu Yulan, Chuan Quanxiang and others entered the hall together to preside over the ceremony in the afternoon, the crowd surged forward even more, shoulder to shoulder, rushing into the funeral hall, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the famous actress's face and pay their respects to her remains. As a result, order was completely lost, and wooden furniture and lawn flowers were all knocked over. Wreaths, flower baskets, and the large photo frame of Xiao Dangui were also trampled into pieces. The military and police authorities temporarily dispatched a large number of personnel to assist in maintaining order, and the coffin placement ceremony proceeded hastily amidst the clamor.</p>
<p>Before the ceremony, Xiao Dangui's face was slightly ulcerated due to arsenic poisoning, so she was re-made-up. A "Zhang Family Qian Clan" ancestral tablet was originally placed before the coffin, but it was removed after discussions with Yuan Xuefen and others. Xiao Dangui's siblings, the children of her husband Zhang Chunfan's first wife, and several godmothers of Xiao Dangui were all present to take care of matters. Xiao Dangui was dressed in seven layers of various colored clothing and four pairs of various colored pants, white stockings, and embroidered shoes. Before the coffin was closed, twenty-five cheongsams, ten-odd close-fitting shirts, pants, and vests, a complete set of pure silver bowls, chopsticks, cups, and spoons, and two silk-cotton quilts that Xiao Dangui had used during her lifetime were placed beside her as burial goods. At 3:40 pm, when the coffin was closed, the crowd waiting anxiously outside the window rushed straight in when the master of ceremonies shouted to pay respects. All six long glass windows were knocked down by the surge of people, and the funeral altar also collapsed. Candlesticks fell to the ground, cries erupted, drums and music sounded together, women screamed that someone was groping them, and the military and police caught several pickpockets.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, Xiao Dangui's husband, Zhang Chunfan, also appeared in mourning clothes, crying sadly. Many other Yue Opera fans also sobbed and wept, and everyone asked each other, "Who will be able to play the Empress (referring to the play *Love of Mountains and Rivers*) in the future?" In the midst of the chaos, another fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl pleaded with those blocking her path in front of the surging crowd, "Please let me in to see her! This is the last time!" Crying and begging, she insisted on entering. The power of Yue Opera to attract the masses was such.</p>
<p>The losses at Paradise during this ceremony totaled over 100 million yuan. The cost of the actress's quilts and bedding amounted to over 30 million yuan, and the nanmu coffin cost 150 million yuan, making it a grand affair. As for when the funeral will be held and whether it will be buried at West Lake, it is currently awaiting consultation between Xiao Dangui's godmother and the Yue Opera community. The truth about Xiao Dangui's murder will reportedly be released after negotiations with various parties.</p>
<p>According to statistics, there were over 50,000 attendees at Paradise yesterday, almost all of whom were women and children. They only began to leave successively at around 5:00 pm after Yuan Xuefen and others broke through the encirclement under the protection of the military and police.</p>

<h3>Hankou Zou Xiehe Gold Shop Owner Detained for Allegedly Embezzling 500 Taels of Gold Deposited by Military Officer</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Hankou, 16th] Zou Runzhi and his brother, Zou of the Zou Xiehe Gold Shop, which has long enjoyed a reputation in Hankou, were recently summoned by the police and detained for allegedly embezzling 500 taels of gold deposited by the family members of a certain military officer. The officer had deposited the gold in the shop, originally intending to use the interest as living expenses for his family. However, due to the war front changing and communication being cut off, the gold shop intended to embezzle the gold, refusing to pay interest or allow withdrawals, leading to a complaint from the officer's family members. It is reported that this deposit was secretly sold in Shanghai by the younger brother, Zou Jingxuan, and was uncovered by the Shanghai police.</p>

<h3>A Talk with Hu Shih: Nanjing, 14th, Our Reporter Pu Dejie</h3>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih (Our Report Photo) "...The students have decided to resume classes this morning!"</p>
<p>When Principal Hu Shih said these words, he was filled with a joyful mood. He pushed up his glasses and folded a newspaper carefully, holding it in his hand as he told the reporter:</p>
<p>"This news is good enough, right? Haha"—this "good enough" news made Principal Hu especially happy, and he spoke a lot despite his busy schedule.</p>
<p>"There are still two students who were arrested at Peking University who have not been released. According to the official announcement of the case, it is quite serious. Both are students in the Economics Department, and their grades are usually good, but I don't know them. They left school a long time ago and only came back to study after the victory."</p>
<p>Talking about the lives of teachers and students in northern schools, he said:</p>
<p>"Coming here and seeing that I can eat white rice, I really feel envious. The situation in the north is too difficult. Everyone eats coarse grains, and the rice is all broken rice, very bad. The students' staple food is corn grits and sorghum flour, and they gnaw on cornbread every day. I came to Nanjing this time only a little over a month since the last time, but prices have risen too much. The north has been affected, and life in general will be even more difficult." As he spoke, he shook his head, and the smile on his face disappeared. The living problems of faculty and students are a new topic for university presidents, weighing heavily on the minds of scholars. He hopes that the salaries of public school teachers and staff will be sufficient to maintain their lives, and the new suggestions from the Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Political Council are reasonable and should be implemented. —But at the same time that the reporter was talking to him, the political affairs meeting had passed the transitional adjustment plan.</p>
<p>Next Year's American Election</p>
<p>Regarding Burritt's "Impressions of a Visit to China," which has aroused widespread attention in both Chinese and American public opinion, he is currently looking for a full text to read. He said that Burritt is a straightforward person, and they know each other well, but he has to wait until he has read his article before expressing his opinion. From here, the reporter and Principal Hu talked about the American election.</p>
<p>"The situation of next year's election is still not clear what the trend is. We have to wait until the Republican presidential candidate is nominated in June and the Democratic Party also decides on the role to be opposed in July before we can observe. The Republican Party has already lost four consecutive elections, and in 1944, Dewey and Roosevelt's votes were not that different, so there will be a competition next year."</p>
<p>Stassen is Most Hopeful</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu, who do you think is most likely to be nominated as a candidate in the Republican Party?"</p>
<p>"It's hard to say. Dewey has strength in the party organization, but a person who has failed before is rarely selected as a candidate again, unless there is a real lack of talent, like Bryan, who was nominated by the Democratic Party as a candidate three times in 1896, 1900, and 1908, but he also failed three times. Eisenhower is a promising one, but we have to wait until he leaves the military. Next year, he will be our principal (Eisenhower will take office as the president of Columbia University), and maybe he will participate in the election. Also, there is the young and capable Stassen, who is only forty years old this year. He started campaigning the earliest, and his talent and ideas are very popular with the American people. I think his hope is the greatest."</p>
<p>He Thinks MacArthur is Old</p>
<p>"What about General MacArthur?"</p>
<p>"Old!"</p>
<p>"Vandenberg?"</p>
<p>"That's right, Michigan supports him, and he is also a relatively promising one."</p>
<p>"Taft?"</p>
<p>"Taft's influence in the Republican Party is not small, but his isolationism is very unfavorable to his campaign. The American people have lost interest in this."</p>
<p>Thoughts on Wallace</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu, what do you think of Wallace's third party?"</p>
<p>"Wallace's faction is supported by very progressive and liberal people in America, but this is ultimately a minority. My judgment is that if the Democratic Party splits, it will inevitably lead to a Republican victory. Since Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party in 1912 and formed the Progressive Party, resulting in failure, no one has done this again in more than 30 years. Although the Progressive Party had more votes than the Republican Party that time, victory still belonged to the Democratic Party's Wilson. Theodore Roosevelt and Taft were both losers."</p>
<p>Diplomacy Will Not Change</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu, where do you think the focus of next year's American election competition will be? Now, the Democratic and Republican parties are united on foreign policy. Will there be any changes by then?"</p>
<p>"American diplomacy currently does not show any signs of changing. The focus of the people's choice is probably still on systems and doctrines that are closely related to their interests."</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu, do you mean that next year's election will not affect American foreign policy?"</p>
<p>He nodded. Finally, he said: "Let's see next summer!"</p>
<p>Principal Hu's talk was stopped at this point due to time constraints. In these ten thousand miles of days where speaking is not for the people, the difficult lives of the northern people and the housework on the other side of the Pacific seem to be the only topics he is willing to discuss. At noon, a feast where he can eat white rice is waiting for him, so the reporter should not bother him any further.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Farmers' Association Celebrates First Anniversary</h3>
<p>Female Members Reach Over Two Thousand</p>
<p>[Our Report from Wuxi, 15th] Since the founding of the Republic of China, there has been no farmers' association organization in our county. Farmers were like loose sand. It was not until October of the fifteenth year that the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department sent people to be responsible for organizing. The following year, the Farmers' Association was established, but it soon ceased its activities. In the twentieth year, the Central Government promulgated the Farmers' Association Organization Law, and the official Farmers' Association was established in March. Later, due to lack of funds, the work was suspended. In the summer of the twenty-fourth year, the County Executive Committee reorganized it, and it was completed in the autumn. Until the autumn of the twenty-sixth year, the war of resistance against Japan began, and the association's affairs were suspended. For eight years of occupation, the farmers suffered all kinds of hardships. In October of the thirty-fifth year, the County Charcoal Association was officially established, and Lu Zaiyang, Hu Zhengling, Hu Huiwu, Zang Wenda, Jiang Yi and others were selected as directors and supervisors. Lu Zaiyang was elected as the chairman of the board of directors (currently a county councilor), presiding over the association's affairs. As of September of the Taiyear, 134 township farmers' associations have been established, and the association's affairs are flourishing. Today (the 15th), at 9:00 am, a first anniversary celebration meeting was held at the County Council, with an unprecedented grand occasion. Currently, there are 2,071 female members in the entire county, including Xu Yueying, the executive director of the Zhangcun Township Farmers' Association in the Sixth District (29 years old, currently the executive director of the Women's Association of the County Council), and Zhou Peihua, the executive director of the Zhangmiaoshe Township Farmers' Association (66 years old, currently the deputy township head and teacher of the Central People's School). Both are women, growing up in the countryside and are very interested in agriculture. They lead the charcoal farmers, develop agricultural movements, and all parties place great hope in them.</p>

<h3>Governing the Jiangfang District; Implementing Emergency Measures in Wartime; The Suppression Command Decides on Four Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] The Zhenjiang-Changzhou-Danyang-Yangzhou Suppression Command received a telegram from the Capital Garrison Headquarters stating that the communist bandits Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, and Su Yu were roaming in Anhui Province along the Jinpu Railway and in various places in northern Jiangsu, attempting to revive their forces. To ensure the safety of the capital region, the command has decided on four measures for ships navigating the Yangtze River within its jurisdiction: Ships are prohibited from docking on the north bank of the Yangtze River, except for ports open to the public in Huaiyin. All ships, except those restricted to certain routes, must navigate along the south bank. Each Jiangfang district must concentrate ships from the north bank of the Yangtze River, berthing them at ports on the south bank, dividing them into baojia units, and assigning personnel to manage them together with local officials. Each Jiangfang district may implement wartime emergency measures, utilizing some motorboats and wooden boats to form patrol teams to patrol the river surface.</p>
<h3>Most Overseas Chinese Merchants in Haiphong Bankrupt; French Authorities Require Exit Identity Cards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 10th] According to overseas Chinese returning from Vietnam: After the French-Vietnamese conflict, overseas Chinese in Haiphong feel unable to do business. Five or six out of ten shops have closed, and the livelihood of overseas Chinese is on the verge of collapse. They all intend to settle their affairs and prepare to return home. However, the French authorities have recently required overseas Chinese to obtain identity cards to exit, costing 200 to 300 Vietnamese dollars per card. The application process is complicated, and applications are only accepted twice a week. Many overseas Chinese cannot obtain the necessary documents in time to return home.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Inspector Chen Dongyuan Discusses University Expenses: Central University Needs Over 2.9 Billion Per Month; Chongqing University Needs Over 700 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Education, responding to an article by Cai Shangsi published in the Dagongbao of Shanghai on the 11th of this month, which stated that "the monthly expenditure of a division of soldiers is 120 million yuan, while the monthly budget for running a university is only over 30 million yuan. The cost of maintaining one division of soldiers can support 39 universities," stated today through Inspector Chen Dongyuan that although the current educational funding is insufficient to meet actual needs, after careful consideration, it is unbelievable that a university can be run with only over 30 million yuan per month. University expenses vary depending on the size of the school and the cost of living in the area. Nanjing Central University, according to current standards, spends over 2.9 billion yuan per month, including "academic and administrative expenses," "living subsidies for faculty and staff," "academic research subsidies," and "student support expenses," among other things. Construction and temporary expenses are not included. Chongqing University is smaller in scale, and the cost of living in the area is lower, but its monthly expenses still reach over 700 million yuan. Cai's comparison of the budgeted expenditure with the actual expenditure has some logical flaws.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Middle School Principals Advocate Increasing Teachers' Training Fees; Hosted Press Conference Yesterday to Explain Views</h3>
<p>[Hualian News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Nanjing's public middle schools, faced with high prices, meager teacher salaries, and insecure livelihoods, previously submitted a written petition through representatives to the Municipal Assembly, requesting the passage of an increase in teachers' training fees for municipal secondary schools. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the principals of various public middle schools hosted a press conference at Municipal No. 1 Middle School, attended by Chen Chongyin and over a dozen others. Chen first reported on the excellent treatment of teachers in private schools and the precedent of collecting teachers' training fees in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai. Xu Yuanpu then stated two points: Increasing teachers' training fees can improve teaching efficiency. The treatment of teachers in municipal schools is inferior to that in private schools, and the mental strain is even greater because of the large number of students eager to enroll in municipal schools to receive education. Each class is already at full capacity, with 70 to 80 students per class. The workload of "teaching" and "grading papers" is inevitably increased. Increasing teachers' training fees is a small amount, but it provides significant mental comfort to teachers. From 1929 to 1937, education in the capital advanced rapidly. During the war, due to insufficient conditions, standards declined. After the victory, rising prices and insecure livelihoods made it impossible to improve standards. To correct this problem, strengthening the teachers' qualifications is essential.</p>

<h3>The "World Scholarly Dictionary" Completed by the Xuetian Museum; Yang Jialuo Discusses Work Plans</h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News] Since its establishment in 1930, the Chinese Xuetian Museum of the World Academy has gathered scholars from the Chinese academic community, dedicating themselves to compiling the "World Scholarly Dictionary" and the "Comprehensive History of the Nation." During the Anti-Japanese War, it endured many hardships, but the editors-in-chief Li Shizeng, Yang Jialuo, and Chu Renxin worked even harder. In September of last year, they completed the first volume of the Chinese edition of the World Scholarly Dictionary, the "Four Treasures Encyclopedia Scholarly Dictionary," with a total of two million words. According to Yang Jialuo, director of the Chinese Xuetian Museum, the "World Scholarly Dictionary" is an ongoing compilation of history and humanities, following the tradition of the French Diderot Encyclopedia, to provide a complete interpretation of the current humanities system. It will be divided into general and special volumes covering over a hundred subjects, including "World," "Nature," "Dictionary," "Lexicon," "Philosophy," "Mathematics and Physics," "International Affairs," and "Art." The "World Scholarly Dictionary," a dictionary with over 200,000 entries and over 8 million words, has recently been completed and will be published soon. The academic history section of the "Comprehensive History of the Nation" has also been completed, divided into 700 volumes.

<h3>Hong Kong Double Tenth Charity Football Match: Hualian and Western Union Draw; Liu Fuquan's Last Kick Makes it a Tie</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Airline News] On Double Tenth National Day, as usual, there was a charity football match between Hualian and the Western Union, held at the Naval Stadium, with kickoff at 4:30 PM. Due to the National Day holiday, there were many football fans. The stadium was full just after 4:00 PM. Governor Grantham of Hong Kong was also a distinguished guest. The Navy band played music, heightening the excitement of the whole stadium. After the Chinese and British national anthems were played and the flag-raising ceremony was completed, the match began. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>No Score in First Half</p>
<p>As soon as the match started, the Western team took control. After a while, Hualian began to launch its first counterattack. Afterwards, the Western Union controlled the midfield again. Once, left-winger Ying Shijie shot fiercely near the goal, but Jun Gan deflected the ball, narrowly averting danger. Then there was a melee, and Hualian also had a chance, shooting fiercely at the goal, but unfortunately it hit the post. Thus, the first half ended with no score.</p>
<p>Tie Game</p>
<p>In the second half, the Western Union continued to hold the offensive. If Jun Gan hadn't performed well, Hualian would have lost early. At the fourteenth minute, the ball went back and forth in the Hualian penalty area. Qing Yu accidentally missed a kick, Mitchell broke in and shot forcefully, Jun Gan could not save it, and the Western Union scored the first goal. Hualian desperately counterattacked. Just one minute later, Jing Cong shot fiercely, seemingly destined to enter, but it was returned by Thelas into a corner kick. As time ran out, Hualian still hadn't made much progress. Suddenly, Liu Fuquan intercepted the ball from the opponent's kick and shot from 35 yards away, tying the game at the end of the match.</p>
<p>Hualian Performs Below Par</p>
<p>Judging from the performance, Hualian should have lost. The Western Union's offense was naturally urgent, and its defense was tight, almost making it impossible for the Hualian forwards to score. Looking at Hualian, none of the five forwards were any good, only Shi Jingcong was relatively active. In the defense, Tan Jun Gan tried his best to defend the city. Hualian's failure to lose should be credited to him. Kong Qingyu and Xie Jinhong also played decently, but the others were too disappointing.</p>
<h3>A Report with the Spirit of the Times: UNESCO and China (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>Chinese Staff: The Chinese staff within the organization: During the preparatory period from the end of the previous year to the end of last year, the internal staff numbered over a hundred. Since the official establishment at the end of last year, the work of various departments has gradually developed, and the number of staff in each department has gradually increased. As of the beginning of October this year, there are approximately five hundred and fifty staff members. There are also five Chinese individuals working within the organization. Two were hired during the preparatory period: one is Guo Youshou, serving as the Director of the Education Department, and the other is Neng Ailing (a Chinese overseas citizen raised in the UK, commonly known as Miss Sam), formerly an assistant staff member in the Natural Sciences Department, now transferred to be an assistant staff member in the News Department (another person hired during the preparatory period was Wu Wending, serving as an advisor in the Natural Sciences Department, who resigned in the spring of this year). Since the organization was officially established at the end of last year, three more individuals have been hired: one is Qian Zhaozhen (the eldest daughter of Qian Tai), serving as an assistant staff member in the Education Department, who took office in January; the second is …, serving as the Director of the Asian News Department, who took office in July; and the third is Wang Jingxian, serving as an advisor in the Natural Sciences Department, who took office in September. In addition to the above five individuals, there are also two Chinese temporary staff members: one is the advisor to the General Assembly, Luo Zhongshu, whose term is five months and expires on October 15th of this year, and the other is Ms. Gui Guizhen, an assistant staff member in the Natural Sciences Department, who arrived in mid-September and whose term was originally only one month but has now been extended.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other Chinese personnel associated with the organization, such as Chen Yuan, who is one of the executive directors, and Zhao Xin, Zhou Lin, who are responsible for liaison work between the Chinese Ministry of Education and the organization (the Chinese Ministry of Education has a permanent office in the organization). These individuals are not staff members hired by the organization, but they have direct relationships with the organization.</p>
<p>Budget</p>
<p>The Organization's Budget and China: Last year, the UNESCO Paris Conference passed a budget for the organization of US$6.95 million, of which US$950,000 was to repay the expenses of last year's preparatory committee, and US$6 million was the budget for this year.</p>
<p>Last year, the Paris Conference also approved a revolving fund of US$3 million for the organization. Each member state was to contribute proportionally based on their economic development, but each member state only paid one-third this year, totaling US$1 million.</p>
<p>Therefore, this year's organization's expenses and revolving fund combined total US$7 million (the proposed budget for next year is US$9 million, which will be discussed and decided at the Mexico Conference).</p>
<p>The expenses shared by each member are roughly proportional to the dues paid to the United Nations. However, due to the United States' special voluntary contribution, this year it alone pays 44.03% of the total expenses, which is approximately US$2.4 million.</p>
<p>China's dues for this year are US$510,825, plus a revolving fund of US$73,500, totaling US$584,325.</p>
<p>Although the proposed budget for next year is US$9 million (the recent Executive Board resolved that next year's budget should not exceed US$9 million), the share borne by each member state should not differ greatly from this year's amount, because Guatemala, Colombia, Uruguay, Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and seven other countries are preparing to join the organization in January next year. There is also talk of Argentina joining. Liberia and Cuba, for example, are two countries that have recently joined since the budget案 passed at the end of last year. In other words, the budget for next year will increase by US$3 million, but the number of new member states may increase by eight or nine compared to when it was established last winter.</p>
<p>This organization will spend US$6 million this year! This is an unprecedented figure in the history of international educational and cultural cooperation, a considerable sum. But this US$6 million is used for education and culture, for peace and construction. It is only the cost of manufacturing six light cruisers! It is only the cost of manufacturing ten bombing planes! It is only one-eightieth of what was spent in one day of World War II!</p>
<p>Prospects</p>
<p>The Organization's Prospects and China: At the Paris founding conference last winter, the charter was approved, and official member states that sent representatives to attend the meeting numbered thirty (namely: China, Arabia, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Ecuador, the United States, France, Greece, Haiti, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, the Dominican Republic, the United Kingdom, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, the Union of South Africa, Venezuela). This year, Liberia joined, and recently Cuba joined. Therefore, the organization currently has thirty-two official member states.</p>
<p>At the Paris conference last winter, twelve countries that had signed the London Charter of November 16, 1945, but had not yet been formally ratified by their governments, also sent representatives to attend the meeting (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Iraq, Iran, Luxembourg, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay, Yugoslavia).</p>
<p>At the Paris conference last winter, countries that were members of the United Nations but had not signed the London Charter of 1945 were also invited to send representatives to attend as observers, totaling seven countries (Russia, Ukraine, Abyssinia, Paraguay, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Byelorussia). As a result, only Paraguay and Costa Rica sent representatives to attend as observers.</p>
<p>However, three countries that were not members of the United Nations sent representatives to attend the founding conference last winter: Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland. At the conference, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland were nominated as candidate members.</p>
<p>These are all China's brotherly members and friendly nations in this organization. China was one of the first countries to participate in the preparation of this organization, not only because of its long history, large population, and love of peace, but also because it is an independent and important ally in world culture. In the future, China's contribution will have a great impact on the development of this organization. China has invited the organization to hold its fifth annual conference in China in 1950, saying that this year will be the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius' birth. "Confucius was a sage of his time." If Confucius were alive today, he would also strive for cooperation in world education, science, and culture. (The End)</p>

<h3>Sixteen Trade Associations Express Conditional Support for Government Acquisition Measures: Decide on Several Principles for Government Adoption, Hoping for Consideration of Merchants' Difficulties When Drafting Detailed Rules; Petition to Relevant Parties Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Representatives from sixteen trade associations in this city related to the import of goods with self-provided foreign exchange held a meeting yesterday at 5:30 PM at 150 Hong Kong Road to discuss how to respond to the government's acquisition plan. Chaired by Zhang Yaozhang, Chairman of the Import-Export Association, representatives from each industry reported separately. Industries such as pigments, hardware, chemical raw materials, and steel bars are still discussing within their respective industries and have not yet reached a conclusion. The iron and chemical raw materials industries believe that re-shipping goods for export poses many practical difficulties. Representatives from the import-export and paper industries proposed several countermeasures. The final conclusion was to conditionally support the government's acquisition measures in principle, but with the hope that the circumstances of merchants could be considered when drafting detailed implementation rules. Discussions then began, and several principles were decided to provide to the government for reference and adoption:</p>
<p>The special foreign currency deposit slips issued by the government can be used in the fourth and fifth periods of quota and non-quota allocations. After the special foreign currency deposit slips expire, they can be used to request the Export-Import Management Committee to issue permits, without being included in the quota, and can be used in place of foreign exchange settlement. The two-month deadline for shipment is too short and should be changed to allow prior registration among industries. Those who wish to re-export should only register first. All registered parties have priority transportation rights until the quota is used up. The implementation rules of the Export-Import Management Committee should explicitly stipulate that when the government publicly sells these goods in the future, the original importers and exporters should have priority to purchase them from the original manufacturers. Special foreign currency deposit slips should be issued in unregistered form, be divisible, and be tradable in the market. This would prevent merchants' funds from being frozen. The government's future selling price should be the acquisition price plus 10%, and the original importers and exporters should still have priority to purchase. Request that representatives from relevant trade associations attend the drafting of the implementation rules by the Export-Import Management Committee for consultation. It was also resolved that each trade association should nominate two representatives to petition the National Bank and the Export-Import Management Committee at 2:30 PM today, and it is also planned to petition the Executive Yuan in Nanjing once. Each trade association will convene emergency meetings and conduct registration of those willing to re-export to support the petitioning representatives.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Hopes Importers Will Sacrifice Personal Interests and Consider the Overall Situation, and That Cooperation Will Solve Any Problem</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the government announced measures to deal with materials arriving at ports with self-provided foreign exchange, importers expressed difficulties. Yesterday, our reporter specially visited Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Export-Import Management Committee, to inquire about his opinions. He granted an interview and stated: "The import of materials must be permitted by the Export-Import Management Committee before they can be imported. This is the key to managing trade. Although merchants in Shanghai have various reasons for their materials arriving at ports, importing them without permission inevitably violates government laws. The Export-Import Management Committee, considering that the materials have been delayed for a long time, which is not a long-term solution, petitioned the government to quickly determine a solution to end the matter as soon as possible. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan meeting proposed a discussion by the Yuan organs, which was handed over to a sub-group for review, then to the Economic Committee for deliberation, and finally, this week, a review meeting was convened, which broadly adopted opinions from all parties, and this decision was finally made. In the review meeting, the representatives of the Export-Import Management Committee repeatedly raised concerns about safeguarding the interests of merchants, and the review meeting accommodated them as much as possible. In handling this matter, the government sought a solution that took into account both maintaining regulatory laws, preventing black market speculation, and the interests of importers, and it has been racking its brains. Especially regarding the stimulation of the black market, based on previous experience, and this time, as soon as the news that the Executive Yuan was opening up the import of goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange was released, the foreign exchange black market suddenly rose, the relationship within which is self-evident. Because the black market hinders exports and remittances from overseas Chinese, and because the black market for foreign exchange, gold, and US dollars affects prices, it is too closely related to the interests of all people. I sincerely hope that importers will understand the government's painstaking efforts in handling this matter, sacrifice their personal interests to seek the welfare of all people. As for the detailed rules for handling, the Export-Import Management Committee is drafting them to quickly reduce inconvenience. As long as we have a spirit of cooperation from top to bottom, there is nothing that cannot be solved."</p>
<h3>Export-Import Management Committee to Conduct Goods Registration Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of goods arriving at ports with self-provided foreign exchange, the Export-Import Management Committee received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday to proceed in accordance with the handling measures. The committee is currently drafting implementation rules, which will be submitted to the Yuan for approval before implementation. According to the committee's spokesperson, the first step in purchasing goods with self-provided foreign exchange will be to conduct registration. Because according to the handling measures, importers who do not want to sell their goods to the government can re-export the goods within 60 days. Therefore, those who wish to sell their goods with self-provided foreign exchange in accordance with the order must first register with the committee, and the committee will review and then purchase them. This registration will begin within two or three days. The committee also stipulates that goods re-exported must not be shipped to Hong Kong or other places, but must be returned to the original place of shipment.</p>
<h3>Banking System Continues to Inject Money, Tight Credit Conditions Persist</h3>
<p>[Our Report] National banks continued to inject 57 billion yuan into the bill exchange yesterday. The tight credit conditions did not relax. Dark interest rates were still quoted at 2.2%, and multiple parties in the off-market Chinese stock market were offering interest subsidies, which have risen to 3%. The funds injected yesterday were mainly for cotton yarn settlement. Central Bank injected 2.6 billion yuan, Greater Exchange exported 2.9 billion yuan, Foreign Bank injected 33.6 billion yuan, Small Exchange exported 8.83 billion yuan, Bank of China injected 4.6 billion yuan, Bank of Communications injected 700 million yuan, Farmers Bank exported 1.2 billion yuan, China Investment Bank injected 1.36 billion yuan, Postal Remittance exported 2.4 billion yuan, and Cooperative Bank exported 2.3 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Credit Cooperative Deposits and Loans Must Not Be Considered Interbank Transactions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding whether transactions between credit cooperatives and banks and money houses can be considered interbank transactions, it is learned that the Ministry of Finance has a concrete explanation: "According to regulations, credit cooperatives, in addition to receiving deposits from non-members after obtaining approval, should limit their credit granting to members. Therefore, their nature is different from that of general banks. Now, the Ministry has stipulated that if banks and money houses legally engage in transactions with credit cooperatives, they must not be considered interbank transactions. All deposits received from credit cooperatives must be treated as ordinary deposits and be subject to deposit reserve requirements. Loans to credit cooperatives should also be treated as ordinary customers and be handled according to general procedures."</p>
<h3>Silk Exports Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Since autumn, China's silk exports have shown signs of improvement. To date, the China Trust Bureau has processed the inspection of more than two thousand out of the five thousand five hundred bales of spring silk delivered by manufacturers, and has shipped them in batches to France (45 bales) and the United Kingdom (90 bales). 800 bales for India were also shipped yesterday. It is also learned that the bureau plans to ship another one thousand bales each to India and the United States, and 75 bales to the United Kingdom this month. The goods shipped to the United States are scheduled to be loaded onto the Courser on the 25th. The current overseas market price is approximately US$4.40 to US$4.20 per pound. The UK market requires finer silk threads and offers better prices. If the situation in India improves, China's silk sales will become more active. The United States has 50,000 to 60,000 bales of stored silk and 80,000 to 90,000 bales of Japanese silk, which are flooding the market, and the market price is sluggish. Japanese silk prices have fallen, and Italian silk has even fallen to around US$3.50.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Improve, Chinese Stocks Weak</h3>
<p>Government bonds tended to improve yesterday. Unified C opened at 16,200 yuan, reached a high of 17,400 yuan, and then hovered around 16,800 yuan. Approximately 5 million changed hands. Rooms 538 and 552 and Runde bought, while Rooms 360, 550, and 503 sold. As a result, Unified A, B, and C each rose by 500 yuan compared to the previous closing price, Unified D rose by 900 yuan, and Unified E improved by 700 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were slightly lower yesterday, and the process was relatively stable. Ewo Cotton opened at 182,000 yuan and retreated from 186,000 yuan to within 180,000 yuan to close. Although the Guangdong dealers bought, the foreign firm dealers and securities dealers sold. As a result, Ewo fell by 0.5% compared to the previous closing price, Paper Industry and Guangdong Ping were flat, and the rest were slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Textile Association Board of Directors Decides to Establish Three Committees</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The first board meeting of the second session of the Textile Association was held yesterday afternoon at the association's headquarters, chaired by Chairman Du ..., to discuss important matters as follows: The Textile Association decided to establish three committees: (A) Committee on Japan: to study issues such as compensation claims against Japan, restrictions on Japanese spindles, and trade with Southeast Asia. (B) Tax Committee: to study issues such as stamp duty, income tax, commodity tax, and business tax. (C) Legal Committee: to study labor and other laws and regulations. It was resolved to publish an irregular publication of the Textile Association to communicate with cotton textile associations in various regions. The organization and personnel issues of each committee were discussed. The Textile Factory Society plans to rent land from the association to build a large auditorium, which will be used jointly by the two associations in the future.</p>
<h3>Police Department Pays Attention to Speculative Chinese Stocks, Retreating Mid-Course</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially rose yesterday, but due to extremely tight credit conditions, off-market delivery was not easy, interest rates rose again, and speculative forces were forced to sell within the market, causing a sharp decline. In the end, the situation was weak, but some small stocks emerged as a surprise force. Huaxin was absorbed by No. 107, and Qinxing's new shares were maintained by No. 204. The former rose by 50%, and the latter rose to the limit.</p>
<p>Morning trading saw mixed results. After opening, Qinxing took the lead in rising, and Meiya also advanced under short squeeze conditions. However, Yongxin was sold off, retreating to a low price of 315 yuan for immediate delivery and 331 yuan for deferred delivery. Meiya and Qinxing improved better and better, and Yongxin also pulled up to a high price of 334 yuan for immediate delivery and 350 yuan for deferred delivery. Xinya rose to the limit, and Qinxing also forced a rise to the limit. Unexpectedly, after 10 o'clock, speculative forces sold off one after another, and the situation changed suddenly. There were many settlements, and the off-market interest rate rose to 2.55% and 3%, making delivery difficult, and the market gradually declined. Near noon, Yongxin retreated to 315 yuan for immediate delivery and 331 yuan for deferred delivery, and then closed at prices of 317 yuan and 333 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, the immediate delivery stocks Dongxin and Xinguang rose to the limit, Meiya, Zhongsi, Xinlei, Cement, and Commercial Press rose slightly, Huachang, Sino-French, and Zhabei fell by 0.5%, Yongxin, Xinyi, Underwear, Tongyi, Zhongfang, Rongfeng, Lian'an, and Xinyi fell slightly, and Xinguang, Jinglun, Match, and Hengfeng Zhongxing were flat. The deferred delivery stocks Qinxing rose to the limit, Meiya rose by 10%, and Yongxin and Xinguang rose by 0.5%, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<p>It was heard that the yarn price was good again, and people were excited. Yongxin rose to 327 yuan for immediate delivery and 342 yuan for deferred delivery. Finally, to deal with the speculative market, the police department had countermeasures, and people's hearts turned weak, and Yongxin still closed at a low level of 318 yuan and 331 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning closing price, the immediate delivery stocks Yongxin, Xinyi, Huachang, Underwear, Xinhua, Zhabei, Zhongfang, Tongyi, and Match rose slightly, Meiya and Zhongsi, and Rongfeng fell slightly, Huaxin rose by 10%, Qinxing still rose to the limit, and the rest were flat. The deferred delivery stocks Dongxin rose to the limit, Huayan fell slightly, and Yongxin and Xinyi were also the same, and Xinguang Jingfu were flat.</p>
<p>The current deferred arbitrage transaction yesterday combined interest rates of about 1.6% to 2%. Yongxin's discounted price opened at 15 yuan, retreated from 16 yuan to 14 yuan, and closed at 15 yuan. Meiya retreated from 25 yuan to 20 yuan, and closed at 23 yuan. Xinyi was between 6.5 yuan and 7.5 yuan, and Xinguang was around 1.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Plans to Improve Tea Production and Sales</h3>
<p>This year, China's export tea production is estimated to reach more than 300,000 dan. As of the end of June, 73,479 bales had been inspected and released by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and 65,334 dan had been inspected and released by the Taiwan Specialty Product Inspection Office. Recently, with the adjustment of foreign exchange, tea merchants can now make profits, and exports have shown a slightly active phenomenon. However, the production and sales methods of domestic tea are still backward and not suitable for foreign competition. The Executive Yuan, in view of this, ordered the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to consult with relevant agencies to draft an outline of a plan for the production and sales of export tea in order to improve it. It is currently being submitted for approval.</p>
<h3>Rice, Grain, Oil, and Cake Continue to Decline</h3>

<p>Yesterday's foreign firm tea market: sellers' desire to raise prices remained unchanged, and export firms, considering that foreign tea prices were still low, did not want to rush to buy at high prices, resulting in a standstill in transactions, but the situation was generally stable and pretty. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, local shops and nearby villages still intended to get involved, but due to the limited supply, it was difficult to get what they wanted, and the number of transactions also decreased, and the market situation was improving.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Turned from Weak to Firm</h3>

<h3>Successful Conclusion of Allocation Meeting - Rayon Allocation Decided - Shanghai Receives 65% of Total</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The meeting convened by the China Trust Bureau, gathering representatives from silk weaving, ribbon weaving, and knitting industries from various regions to discuss the allocation of rayon, successfully concluded yesterday afternoon. Although representatives from different regions had some disputes regarding the allocation ratio of rayon, they ultimately cooperated harmoniously and resolved the matter smoothly. The allocation ratio of rayon for the silk weaving industry in various regions will be based on the actual number of silk weaving machines in each region. According to this calculation, Shanghai will receive 65% of the total, while Hangzhou and five other locations will collectively receive 35%.</p>
<p>The number of weaving machines in each region is as follows: Hangzhou 5535 machines, Suzhou 1557 machines, Shengze 1114 machines, Wuxing 463 machines, Wuxi 164 machines, Tianjin 1086 machines, and Shanghai 6800 machines.</p>
<p>Assuming the monthly allocation is 7,000 cases, the allocation ratio would be: Shanghai 4,550 cases, and other cities a total of 2,450 cases. Within that, Hangzhou 1,370 cases, Suzhou 384 cases, Shengze 275 cases, Wuxing 114 cases, Wuxi 40 cases, and Tianjin 267 cases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, assuming the monthly allocation for the ribbon weaving industry is 580 cases, Shanghai will receive 500 cases and Suzhou 80 cases. Other regions have not yet reported their needs, so no allocation has been approved for the time being.</p>
<p>As rayon is not the primary raw material for the knitting industry, it was not discussed during the meeting. In the future, when needed, the China Trust Bureau's rayon allocation committee will refer to the actual situation and re-allocate accordingly. Also, if the monthly amount of rayon arriving at the China Trust Bureau increases or decreases, the allocation will be adjusted proportionally according to the above-determined figures.</p>
<p>Tightening Credit, Rayon Prices Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of 120 Dan Rayon such as Xu Zi You Guang etc., was first offered at 80 million yuan in the morning, with transactions at a minimum of 75 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was demand at 78 million yuan. Eventually due to tightening credit and growing unease, the offering price was at 78 million yuan but there were no takers. Transactions for 3A grade goods occurred at 68-69 million yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Factory Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday morning there were slight transaction, D grade goods were traded opening at 68 million yuan for 7-day notes, other mid-grade goods were offered at 6-7 million yuan, high-grade at 8 million yuan, with credit terms of a few days on the payments. In the afternoon, due to tightened credit, supply was greater than demand, there were no transactions. Dry goods were scarce and offered at steady prices.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Zhen Silk blanket fabrics from Da Cheng and Hua Qiang opened between 22.9 million and 30 million yuan, with maximum next-day contracts at 450,000 yuan, the price fell slightly at the close. With spot trading done at 2.9 million yuan and next day contracts at 3.1 million yuan. Prices for American goods remained flat with little trading, Hua Jin high-end goods offered at 60,000 yuan, with very little trading for all goods, offering prices were firm.</p>

<h3>The Latest Discovery on the Principles of High Blood Pressure</h3>
<p>— Wang Wanbai</p>
<p>I have high blood pressure, so I am particularly concerned about it. Recently, I saw an article in the well-known American magazine "Time" revealing a new understanding of high blood pressure, which aroused great interest. I had just given a radio broadcast on it, and now I am honored to be asked by this publication to contribute an article. I am providing this translated record for your review and correction.</p>
<p>An Amazing Discovery</p>
<p>High blood pressure accounts for one-third of all mortality in the United States, so the medical community recognizes this disease as the most dangerous disease of the 20th century civilization, and also the most difficult to understand. However, today, it is possible to provide a clear explanation for this previously incomprehensible mystery, because a British scientist has found a clue to this disease. The conclusion of his discovery is that the increase in blood pressure is actually due to a "short circuit" in the blood circulation within the kidneys. The reason for this phenomenon is that the nerves are overly stressed.</p>
<p>An Accidental Discovery</p>
<p>The discovery of the new understanding of high blood pressure was actually a matter of chance, just as the discovery of Penicillin was also accidental. In 1941, when Britain was subjected to intense bombing by enemy planes, paramedics discovered that people injured by collapsing houses, whose legs had been compressed by heavy objects for several hours, would suddenly die of kidney failure, which was quite mysterious, and the danger was no different from heart failure.</p>
<p>But how could leg compression affect the kidneys? Soon, a Spanish physician, Josep Trueta, and his four colleagues at the Oxford Medical Research Institute, conducted blood circulation experiments on rabbits in their spare time. They tightly tied tourniquets around the hind legs of the rabbits, then injected colored liquid into the arteries of the rabbits, and observed the results with X-rays. Soon they found the mysterious answer: after prolonged compression of the arteries in the legs, the surrounding blood vessels would spasm, resulting in obstructed blood circulation to the kidneys, thus leading to the dangerous consequence of kidney failure.</p>
<p>Anemia in the Renal Cortex</p>
<p>Now that the principle of kidney failure caused by prolonged limb compression had been successfully studied, Trueta's research team conducted further exploration. They found that the blood circulation in the kidneys has an automatic emergency response mechanism from the inner layer to the outer layer. When the blood supply to the renal cortex is blocked, the blood in its arteries will take a shortcut, passing through the larger blood vessels in the renal medulla and returning to the veins. As a result, the renal cortex becomes extremely anemic, lacking blood and oxygen, leading to starvation. The consequences are as follows: ① The secretion of urine decreases or even stops completely. ② The anemic renal cortex immediately secretes a substance (probably a hormone) to stimulate the whole body to increase blood pressure.</p>
<p>Based on the above discovery, Trueta's research team found a clue: this phenomenon of shortening the blood circulation path in the kidneys can also be produced by many other stimulating methods. For example, stimulating a certain nerve with electricity can also achieve the same effect. Also, severe bleeding, or the application of heavy doses of endocrine hormones (such as epinephrine and pituitary hormones), or the injection of toxins secreted by pyogenic bacteria, can all have a stimulating effect. Therefore, the research team concluded that tense nerves constrict the blood vessels of the kidneys, causing blood to flow into the larger blood vessels in the renal medulla instead of the fine blood vessels in the renal cortex, resulting in a lack of blood in the renal cortex. Therefore, the body automatically adjusts to increase blood pressure, forcing more blood to reach the renal cortex.</p>
<p>Emotional Attacks</p>
<p>Doctors have long felt that a certain type of high blood pressure is closely related to the kidneys, and they also know that anger or other emotional attacks can raise blood pressure. We have what is called "essential hypertension," which accounts for 95% of all hypertension cases. It is only known to be related to the kidneys, but no detailed explanation has been given. Now, the physiological circulation of high blood pressure demonstrated by Trueta's research team can explain the principle of this essential hypertension.</p>
<p>According to Trueta's research team, changes in kidney blood circulation are merely passive tools, and the one manipulating these tools is actually the nerves. Any sudden injury to the nervous system, or emotional stress, can cause such an attack. Therefore, the research team announced in their recently published book "Studies on Kidney Blood Circulation," stating that we firmly believe that the main cause of high blood pressure has been found to belong to the central nervous system, that is, in one's own mind. If they can fully understand this point, it will bring great new hope to patients with essential hypertension. (Translator's note: The implication is that patients should not be in a state of worry, fear, or being busy and tense all day long. Therefore, a pleasant and peaceful state of mind is the secret to preventing and treating high blood pressure.)</p>
<h3>DDT and Prisoner Hygiene (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hu Qipeng</p>
<p>This is from the perspective of humanity and law. We must pay attention to prison hygiene and the improvement of prisoners' lives. From the perspective of public health, it should also be valued. Especially prisons built in urban areas, because infectious diseases in prisons have a high chance of spreading to citizens and becoming a pandemic. For example, in the years 1577, 1730, and 1750, Britain's prisons experienced three outbreaks of infectious plague. The deaths of prisoners piled up, and the disease spread to citizens, causing many deaths. Now, looking at several prisons and detention centers in Shanghai, there have been deaths from infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, epidemic typhus, and relapsing fever over the years. In the years 1933, 1938, 1940, and 1944, the Shanghai Detention Center of the Shanghai Local Court on Sinan Road (formerly the Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Rue Massenet) experienced an outbreak of epidemic typhus (this disease is very easy to occur in prisons, so it was formerly known as "jail fever"). The spread was very severe. The mortality rate of prisoners in the prison broke records. Guards, staff, prison directors, and prison medical officers were all infected and died. In 1944, during the enemy-puppet era, Zhang Yipeng, the puppet Minister of Justice, died of infection after visiting the prison for inspection. In the same year, many citizens were also infected. In the two years since the war, various prisons and detention centers have received many DDT liquid and powder agents distributed by the Relief Administration. Prison medical officers must use them cautiously at all times. Therefore, the formerly dreaded epidemic typhus and relapsing fever have gradually decreased. By 1946, they had not been found. This is because the viruses of these two diseases are entirely spread by body lice as vectors. Prisoners in prisons and detention centers are most prone to fleas and lice because their clothing and bedding are unclean and rarely washed. Now that fleas and lice have been killed by DDT, these two terrible infectious diseases have also been eliminated. As shown in this statistical chart, the number of prisoners housed in various prisons and detention centers is inversely proportional to the number of deaths. Comparing the past death toll, it can be said that DDT has saved many prisoners who were about to die from diseases.</p>
<p>Table of Prisoners Housed and Deaths in Shanghai Prisons and Detention Centers in 1945 and 1946</p>
<p>Of course, emphasizing the hygiene of prisoners in prisons and detention centers does not mean that we can be fearless just because we have DDT. It is still important to pay attention to prisoners' living quarters, diet, clothing, bedding, exercise, environmental cleanliness, and mental health. These are all fundamental points for improving prison hygiene. For example, when it comes to the hygiene of prisoners' clothing and bedding, after prisoners enter prison, they all wear clothing and bedding prepared by the prison, and they often bathe and change clothes, so that fleas and lice have no way to parasitize. If fleas and lice are completely eliminated, DDT will not be necessary. The two infectious diseases of epidemic typhus and relapsing fever will never be found in prisons again. Clean and tidy prisoners' clothing and bedding is not only related to cleanliness and hygiene, but also has important implications for prison security and appearance. Therefore, I firmly believe that the wise judicial authorities, in view of the fact that the hygiene of prisoners in prisons and detention centers can affect the public health of citizens, and at the same time need to realize the meaning of modern imprisonment, will definitely actively improve the hygiene of prisoners in prisons and detention centers.

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Infantile Convulsions</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Convulsions are the most common disease in children. If you walk along the street, you can see signs everywhere that say "Family Tradition of Massage, Specializing in Treating Acute and Chronic Convulsions." When convulsions occur, it is truly a shocking event. A lively and clever child suddenly foams at the mouth, loses consciousness, and the whole body convulses, causing the whole family to panic and seek medical advice and divination, caught off guard. "Acute convulsions meet a slow doctor" - a kind of anxious attitude can be seen from these eight words.</p>
<p>Medically speaking, convulsions are not the name of a disease, but a symptom of a disease. Any febrile disease in children, digestive disorders, acute indigestion, dysentery, meningitis, encephalitis, or pertussis, uremia, can often cause convulsions. Because the brain center of infants and young children, his reflex inhibition function, has not yet been fully developed, some minor stimuli can cause convulsions or a state of spasm, especially when children encounter high fever, his reflex function is somewhat increased, and it is easier to cause systemic spasms. There are also some neurotic children who suddenly have convulsions when they are slightly frightened or angry. More are caused by the existence of intestinal parasites, such as roundworms. True epilepsy, commonly called "sheep madness," and symptomatic epilepsy, such as congenital dementia, cerebral palsy, sequelae of encephalitis, can also cause convulsions.</p>
<p>Emergency treatment for convulsions: Since there are so many causes of convulsions, the patient's family cannot treat it themselves. However, before the doctor arrives, emergency measures are also very important. First, put the child to bed quietly, loosen the child's clothes, and place a cold towel or ice pack on the head to promote awakening. Try to avoid all kinds of stimuli, and use a screen to block strong light. Open the windows to allow air to circulate. The sick room should be quiet. When children are having convulsions, people often unconsciously shout loudly, even breaking porcelain. Sometimes when the doctor enters, there is no place to put his feet. This is not only a meaningless act, but also does not benefit the patient. On the one hand, an enema should be given first, which can expel the contents of the intestine, reduce bloating, and also reduce convulsions. The stool after the enema should be saved and can be examined for its properties when the doctor arrives, especially when dysentery is prevalent and the child has not yet had diarrhea, and high fever and convulsions occur first, which is often encountered.</p>
<p>As for the treatment method, of course, it is necessary for the doctor to come, after examination, before treatment. Speaking of the prognosis, it varies depending on the condition. However, most of the diseases that cause convulsions in children are colds, fever, indigestion, constipation, roundworms, etc., which are naturally not very dangerous. The massage of Old Lady Wang and Mama Li is effective, mostly for these types of diseases. If it is encephalitis, meningitis, dysentery, etc., and it is not treated early, then there is a danger to life.</p>
<h3>Nutritional Disorders in Breastfed Infants</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Nutritional Disorders in Infants Fed with Human Milk</p>
<p>When overnutrition leads to milk regurgitation, vomiting, or diarrhea, it is advisable to shorten the breastfeeding time and reduce the frequency of feeding. Do not breastfeed within four or five hours.</p>
<p>In severe diarrhea, a small amount of cathartic may be given first, followed by an astringent. For cathartics, use calomel (0.01 taken at once, or 0.05 per dose, three times a day) or castor oil (3.0 taken at once, once a day); for astringents, bismuth subnitrate is commonly used (0.1 per dose, three times a day), etc.</p>
<p>Even after recovery, it is advisable to prohibit breastfeeding more than five or six times a day.</p>
<p>Nutritional Insufficiency</p>
<p>If breast milk secretion is insufficient, it can be accurately determined by measuring the weight before and after breastfeeding. In addition, even if secretion is sufficient, but the nature of the breast milk is like colostrum, mixed feeding should be performed; if breast milk secretion is still insufficient or contains colostrum globules, and the child's developmental delay and gastrointestinal symptoms do not decrease, weaning can be started and breast milk discarded, but it is still not advisable to completely discard breast milk.</p>
<p>As for acute gastrointestinal disease, nephritis, or beriberi in the mother, or when the infant develops symptoms, the approach should be to first try mixed feeding and not discontinue breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Situations Where Human Milk is Unsuitable</p>
<p>When the mother or wet nurse suffers from an acute infectious disease, or when the infant shows clear symptoms of beriberi, and in cases of tuberculosis in the breastfeeding woman, breastfeeding must be discontinued and a healthy wet nurse chosen; except for these situations, if the breastfeeding woman has no abnormalities and her milk is suitable for other infants, but is uniquely unsuitable for her own infant, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and other nutritional disorders, although it is extremely rare in practice, there are still examples. In this case, breastfeeding should also be discontinued and the infant fed the milk of another wet nurse, or artificial nutrition must be completely transitioned to. However, mixed feeding is best. In short, the best standard for wet nurse selection (Ammenwahl) is to examine the nutritional status of the wet nurse's own child.</p>
<p>Constipation in Infants Fed with Human Milk</p>
<p>Constipation in infants fed with human milk may be due to a small amount of milk intake, or it may be due to an excessive amount, so attention should be paid to this point first, and the best approach to treating constipation is to avoid using medications.</p>
<p>1.  Enema (glycerin or equal parts water and glycerin)</p>
<p>2.  Abdominal massage: First, rub and pinch the skin of the abdomen with the thumb and forefinger for two to three minutes, then massage the rectus abdominis muscle from the upper part to the lower part and then from the lower part to the upper part, then massage the lateral abdominal muscles (with the thumb on the front abdomen and the other four fingers on the corresponding back), and then place the palm between the ileum and the ribs to make circular movements, lightly rubbing and finally imagining the jejunum to move in the same way as its peristalsis, massaging in sequence. This massage is sometimes effective.</p>
<p>3.  Use Liebig's juice or malt extract paste, one or two teaspoons daily, dissolved in soup and given to the infant. (Refer to appendix) (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Jaundice</h3>
<p>— Chu Linzun</p>
<p>This name is very common. When we see this term, or hear this word, we will think of a patient's skin, the whites of the eyes, showing a particularly yellow color, the color of the urine is also very dark, on the contrary, the stool is sometimes grayish-white, the skin is itchy, and the pulse is relatively slower. It seems that diagnosing jaundice is very easy. You don’t need to consult a doctor. Can’t you determine what disease you have and take some medicine for jaundice? Of course, there are many medicines, or some secret recipes. After taking them for a few days, the disease slowly gets better, and you think it’s the effect of the medicine. However, the fact is not like this; because there are many diseases that you don’t take any medicine for, and after a considerable period of time, they naturally get better. Some people, too, get jaundice, take the same prescription, and not only do they not get better; they almost lose their lives. Perhaps they took an effective and miraculous elixir that worked on others, but really lost their own lives. What is the reason for this? Because without proper diagnosis and treatment, getting better is luck, and not getting better is what you expect!</p>
<p>Jaundice is a symptom, and many diseases, and many causes, can show the same symptoms. This is a good example of the same symptoms but different causes. There are also many diseases where the cause is the same but the symptoms are different.</p>
<p>Now, I will introduce to readers the names of several major diseases that can cause jaundice symptoms: infectious jaundice, the same as serum hepatitis, drug-induced jaundice, chemical jaundice, jaundice caused by systemic infectious diseases, acute yellow atrophy of the liver, Weil's disease, actinomycosis, leukemia, Horlgkin's disease, amyloidosis, echinococcosis, Leishmaniasis, Histoplasmosis, liver abscess (A. bacterial pyogenic, B. amoebic), congestive heart failure, thyrotoxicosis, pancreatitis, duodenal ulcer, chronic hepatitis (cirrhotic), pancreatic cancer, Vater's ampulla cancer, extrahepatic bile duct cancer, gallbladder cancer, metastatic liver cancer, primary liver cancer, acute cholecystitis, bile duct stones, bile duct stricture, hypersplenic hemolytic jaundice, constitutional lung dysfunction, neonatal jaundice.</p>
<p>Although I have written so many disease names, it is not complete, but it is already too much for the general reader! These few disease names may give you an impression that jaundice is a symptom, and its causes are many. The causes are different, and the treatment methods are of course different. Some require a surgeon; some require an internist, and some require a pediatrician, because the causes of neonatal jaundice are also very complex, and detailed differential diagnosis is needed. In short, regardless of male, female, old, or young, when you are sick, you should ask a doctor for a detailed examination to determine an accurate diagnosis and the most effective and economical treatment method. Do not be self-righteous and take medicine indiscriminately with a smattering of knowledge. There are often many diseases that can be diagnosed and treated with today's medicine, but are repeatedly misdiagnosed by patients or their families; resulting in an unknown sacrifice!</p>

<h3>The Arab People</h3>
<p>— Lun</p>
<p>Mentioning the Arab people cannot help but evoke many historical memories. Thirteen hundred years ago, the prophet Muhammad preached a monotheistic religion to the citizens and tribes of western Arabia, and this religion was the beginning of Islam. In the year 622 AD, they established colonies, forcing the conquered people to submit to their language and race, and spreading their religious beliefs. Through a kind of merger (in which some refused to merge), a new and greater Arab nation was born. So until now, Muhammad established a small country in Medina. But this small country should not be underestimated, because it has a very glorious and splendid history. Within eighty years, it had roamed the west of Asia, reaching the mountains of Afghanistan, and crossed North Africa, reaching the Atlantic coast. Wherever they went, they asked people how to define the Arab nation. We only have one answer that is close to the truth: all those who recognize Muhammad's mission and the belief in the Arab Empire as the historical center, and all those who recognize the Arabic language and its cultural traditions as a common heritage, are Arabs.</p>
<p>For more than a hundred years, the Arabs have lived under the cultural traditions of medieval Islam, still maintaining a balance of social and economic interests and religious control, while maintaining a calm and detached attitude towards political and governmental issues. They are xenophobic and regard Europeans as uncivilized barbarians.</p>
<p>The starting point of Islamic nationalism is undoubtedly religious rather than nationalistic, and this should be remembered. They are now reviving the dream of the past Islamic empire and appearing on the current world political stage with a new image of the Arab League. This hope has gradually intensified for the surging national movement.</p>

<p>Forgetfulness</p>
<p>— Rong Guan</p>
<p>Not long ago, China was considered a forgetful nation. This forgetfulness probably originated with King Wu of the Spring and Autumn period. History records that King Wu, Helü, was defeated and killed by Goujian of Yue. The son of King Wu (Fucha) had someone stand in front of the court every day, calling his name whenever he entered or exited, and asking: "Fucha! Have you forgotten the hatred of the Yue people who killed your father?" He would answer: "I dare not forget."</p>
<p>He said he "dared not forget," but three years later, Fucha defeated Goujian; Goujian submitted and sued for peace, offering beautiful women. Fucha indulged in sensual pleasures and forgot everything about his previous teacher. "Twenty years later, we'll see who's stronger." Fucha was forced to sign a treaty of surrender. Presuming Fucha to be the ancestor of forgetfulness, there are probably few objections.</p>
<p>Therefore, "when the Way is not practiced, one may as well drift on a raft." How long ago was it that this amnesia has crossed the Pacific Ocean and reached the east of the sea? Uncle Sam, who claims to be scientifically advanced and to have entered the atomic age before the world, probably overuses his brain, but rarely replenishes it. It would be fine if his own memory was weak! Raising a tiger brings trouble. What about its impact on human peace? But the old man of the United States simply doesn't consider this. Here is an example:</p>
<p>The work of revitalizing Germany and Japan has become a concrete measure. Even Marshall, who is openly known as the "American Helmsman," has unreservedly expressed his intention to revive West Germany in his European Recovery Program. In Japan, General MacArthur has taken it upon himself to be biased towards Japanese "democracy": huge loans, opening of trade... This is still not enough; the chairman of the Japan Committee, Sebald, even added fuel to the fire by resolutely advocating that Japan's industrial level should be raised above the old standard of 1930-34...</p>
<p>In this way, the repetition of past mistakes is self-evident—although Fucha's forgetting of national hatred still came after a long period of preparation of "ten years of accumulation and ten years of training." But now, less than six years after the "Pearl Harbor War," how can our old American completely forget the past? Is this a "good" thing?</p>
<p>Moreover, Fucha's forgetfulness was just a matter of his own affairs, but in the old United States, this forgetting often brings the disaster of suffering to millions of lives when new war opportunities arise! Alas! Alas!</p>
<h3>Straight Lines and Curved Lines</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>After Chinese people leave school and mess around in society for a few years, after being hit by hard and soft nails many times, experience tells them that it is impossible to survive in a society like China's by being too honest. They learn to adopt strategies such as "selecting the real and rejecting the false," "not fighting hard battles," and "seizing opportunities," to engage in the struggle for life. The purpose of such strategies is to strive for the greatest results with the least sacrifice, and to return with a full load of spoils, once and for all.</p>
<p>However, young people who are new to the world are often young and vigorous and do not understand this philosophy of life. Facing the ripe leaves on the tree, they drool and are eager to swallow them, wishing they could rush forward and grab them; but they are often tripped by stumbling blocks. As for those with experience, they can avoid straight lines that are prone to bumping into walls, and satisfy their desires in a situation where they are considerate in all aspects and foolproof.</p>
<p>I remember a year ago, Wang Jingwei's traitors, such as Chen Gongbo and Miao Bin, in order to whitewash their ugly deeds, falsely claimed in court that their treasonous behavior was a so-called curved line of patriotism. The difference between treason and patriotism is as clear as day and night. Traitors still call themselves curved patriots. The curve of their line cannot be more curved.</p>
<p>Chinese people love to talk about face and like vanity. They can never be pragmatic. Even if there is a perfect plan, it is difficult to follow it, because when doing things, one must be considerate in all aspects in order to avoid unforeseen obstacles. It really feels like it takes a long time and is futile. However, if you don't do this, there will be more resistance, and you simply can't take a step. Generally, those who travel around the world and sell dog skin plasters have to bow and salute to the audience when they set up a ring and start performing, and recite words to ask the brothers to help. The same is true for those who sing Beijing opera to open a stage. Yu Shuyan, who was proud, did not pay attention to this set and wanted to break this bad habit of "paying respects to the mountain stronghold." However, the first time he took the stage in Shanghai, he was greatly embarrassed and was forced to leave immediately, buying a ticket back to Beiping overnight and never coming to Shanghai again. This example shows the difficulty of establishing oneself in the world. Although science has progressed to the atomic age, the atmosphere of opening a stage and paying respects to the mountain stronghold in all levels of society not only remains unchanged to this day, but may have become even worse.</p>
<p>At this moment, large and small government offices all have units such as "personnel offices" or "public relations departments." The original motivation was to save the time of most people and not waste it endlessly on personnel disputes, so they set up separate institutions to be solely responsible, allowing them to not care about anything and to specialize in bowing and saluting in all directions along a vague curved line in order to avoid friction and reduce disputes. Who knew that friction would become more intense and disputes would increase to an extreme extent.</p>
<p>The average life expectancy of Chinese people is only thirty-five years. In order to save time, people take curved lines, we must take straight lines, and people take straight lines, we must take the shortest "vertical lines" in order to catch up. However, we have to make a big detour.</p>
<p>Now the fact is that construction is taking the winding curved line, while destruction is choosing the straightforward straight line. Therefore, our compatriots in this country are more likely to fail than succeed.</p>
<h3>Razor</h3>
<p>— Cai Rulin</p>
<p>Just as the war broke out, three Scottish youths went to the recruitment office to volunteer. They volunteered to contribute to the country, and each had hair about three and a half feet long.</p>
<p>"Why do you young people have such long hair?" The sergeant at the recruitment office asked them in surprise.</p>
<p>"Oh—that's because our brother took the razor with him when he went to America six years ago!" the eldest one explained.</p>
<h3>Song of Autumn Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>In a small, cramped, dark room, a lamp casts a dim green light like a bean. I dip my brush in ink and spread out paper to write poetry, but Mr. Mosquito pricks my arm. I search for a fan and wave it, but it returns again and again, buzzing and humming like thunder. Helpless to dispel my sorrow, I sigh three times; to break the boredom, I gulp down a cup of wine. The small one is like a needle, hissing and sighing (or buzzing, groaning, wailing, and hissing). Your biting me is a strange thing indeed. My body is now dry with oil and water, I hope you don't mind that there's no flavor! You must pity my thin bones, lonely and frail, embracing illness. Is it because I have too many emotions that I attract trouble? Or is it because my flesh is delicious that you love me so much? You rush forward to suck and draw. And don't you see the bewitching modern woman next door, with her white teeth, red lips, and skin like floss? Her perfumed sweat is as sweet as candy, and she feigns anger and coquetry with a peculiar charm. Are you afraid of Western DDT? You imitate those Westerners by settling down here. I don't know what karma from a previous life has made us so different. Your stings are like arrows, your hair roots piercing in and changing my face. It itches and stings, but you don't want to scratch. When it hurts, even Bian Que can't cure it. The next night, red towers cast floral shadows, hurrying the remnants of sweet dreams at the third watch of the moon. Who is injecting all night long? The blood transfusion project is always you. Alas, alas! Business is dwindling, and the gate is closed. Every morning, I force myself to eat vegetable roots; I tremble at the thought of your arrival and am even more heartbroken when dusk arrives. Don't you see? The big, sturdy fellow next door, with his pig's waist and turtle's back, is oily all over. He idly lies on his back, legs spread wide, waiting for you to sever the connection!</p>
<p>Note: Mr. Mosquito: another name for the mosquito.</p>
<p>Zhuo Pu: a colloquial term, used to describe a person with a large frame.</p>
<p>Legs spread wide: describes the posture of lying on one's back.</p>
<p>DDT: i.e., DDT!</p>
<h3>Supplement to the Revolutionary Grass</h3>
<p>— Duyun</p>
<p>Yun Yaojun wrote an article on "Revolutionary Grass" in a woodblock journal. I would like to add a few words based on what I know.</p>
<p>In the countryside, Revolutionary Grass is indeed seen as a "life-threatening grass." Not only has it been discovered in the Jiaxing-Huzhou area, but it also grows everywhere in the river ports of my hometown, Ningbo, hindering navigation. If you pull it ashore, it has no nutrients for the fields, and there is very little ash when it is dried and burned, so it can be said to be useless.</p>
<p>"Revolutionary Grass" is also sold in flower gardens in Shanghai, mostly planted in mud pots. The leaves are light green, floating on the water like wheat leaves, and a bit like ginkgo leaves. The stems are short, forming a round ball in the middle and hollow. The villagers call it a cannon, because revolution and fighting require cannons. The flowers bloom on top, in light blue, like irises. They can bloom continuously for three or five flowers, beautiful and pleasing to the eye, and can be used as potted plants. Because the stems have air bubbles, they float on the water without sinking, and their reproductive power is very strong. If the villagers do not remove them in time, the river ports will be blocked in one or two months, hindering traffic.</p>
<p>"Revolutionary Grass" was discovered in large quantities around the years 4 and 5 of the Republic of China. At that time, bandits and bullies in eastern Zhejiang often called themselves the "Second Revolutionary Army" and extorted money. The people hated them. Just when this grass was discovered, they called it Revolutionary Grass. After the bandits were wiped out, the villagers removed the grass, believing that it was reliable and that the name lived up to reality.</p>
<p>In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the May Fourth Movement of students rose up, with class boycotts, parades, speeches, costume dramas, and the launching of a boycott of Japanese goods. At that time, this grass propagated again for the second time, and the river surface was silted up. The villagers called it "Student Grass," saying that its flowers were brilliant, but its stems were empty. It could not fertilize the fields, nor could it be used as firewood. It was a "useless" scholar. Unexpectedly, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, this grass thrived for the third time. It seemed that in addition to Revolutionary Grass and Student Grass, the villagers also called it "Peace Grass," referring to the fact that the puppet organization's Peace Army had empty strength but would disturb the people everywhere.</p>
<p>The villagers changed the name of this grass three times, placing their meaning in the grass and trees, which shows the general feelings of the people!</p>

<p>A and B were sitting in the same train carriage. B was an old man and looked very depressed. When the train arrived at the first station, B hurriedly got off the train and ran out onto the platform; but after a while, he got back on the train, panting. After the train passed one station, B did the same thing at every station. A, driven by curiosity, couldn't help but ask B the reason.</p>
<p>"Well," B said, "I recently asked an expert to examine my heart, and he said that my heart was in such bad condition that it could die at any time. Therefore, I thought it would be better to buy tickets station by station."</p>

<h3>Needlework for Dollars</h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>Thousands of British women, led by the 81-year-old Queen Mary, have organized a sewing group to earn dollars for the British Empire.</p>
<p>The knitted or sewn goods are transported to the United States and other dollar areas by a non-profit export company, and the workers are paid in pounds by the government.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Women's Voluntary Service has been promoting the "Needlework for Dollars" campaign with the help of the government.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said: "We welcome any plan to earn dollars, but sewing will be even more beneficial to us, who are lacking in labor."</p>
<p>British women will use their spare time, with materials supplied by the Women's Voluntary Service, to earn dollars for their country stitch by stitch.</p>
<h3>Talking About Chrysanthemums in the Hunting West Wind</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiang</p>
<p>"Alas, the chrysanthemum east of the fence, the stems are sparse and the leaves are thin, although it is said to be different from orchids and irises, it also has its own fragrance. The wine in the cup is not yet cold, and it is only stained with clear dew. When it is in bloom, you do not pick it, what will it rely on when it falls in Luoyang?"</p>
<p>— Li Bai</p>
<p>Wandering along the riverbank, in the hunting west wind, I saw the changing yellow chrysanthemums. Chrysanthemums are the representative of hermits in ancient times. Since being praised by Tao Yuanming, they have been loved by a group of people.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of chrysanthemums. One kind has purple stems, a fragrant smell, and a sweet taste. Only the kind whose leaves can be used as vegetables is the true kind. The other kind is dark green, has a wormwood smell, and is inedible. It is bitter and difficult to distinguish from the true chrysanthemum. Ordinary people regard the bitter kind as the true chrysanthemum.</p>
<p>There are the most types of chrysanthemums. Fan Chengda's Chrysanthemum Manual lists chrysanthemums as thirty-five varieties, and Wang Xiangjin's Group of Fragrances lists chrysanthemums as one hundred and seventy-two varieties. The colors are divided into yellow, white, purple, and red. In fact, to this day, there are probably more than three hundred types of chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>The famous varieties include Imperial Robe Yellow, Grand Tutor Red, and Green Heaven Rong, etc., more than one hundred and seventy varieties. In terms of orthodoxy, yellow chrysanthemums are considered the most precious, but the common people prefer novelty. Many people like to see variegated colors such as red and purple, while the true-colored chrysanthemums are not valued.</p>
<p>Poems about chrysanthemums most easily reveal a person's temperament. Notes on the Noble Ear says: "Huang Chao served his grandfather at the age of five. For the joint verse about chrysanthemums, the grandfather thought but could not reach it, and Chao replied casually: 'Worthy to be the head of all flowers, naturally endowed with ocher yellow clothes.' Chao's father was surprised and wanted to whip him; the grandfather said: 'The grandson can write poetry, but he does not know the weight of things. He can be asked to write another poem.' Chao also said: 'The rustling west wind fills the courtyard, the cold petals and cold fragrance are hard for butterflies to come. If I become emperor in the coming years, I will move them to bloom with peach blossoms.' The domineering meaning can already be seen in childhood. Like Zhu Yuanzhang's poem about chrysanthemums, he also said: 'I do not bloom when all the flowers bloom, and when I bloom, I will scare everyone. I want to fight a battle with the west wind and cover my whole body with golden armor.' It is also a self-appointed meaning of the ninth five. However, Zhu Shuzhen, who wrote about 'Last year on the Lantern Festival, the flower market was as picturesque as a painting,' said of chrysanthemums: 'The earthen flower can be white and can also be red, and it can still love this skill in its later years. I would rather embrace the fragrant branches and grow old than dance with the yellow leaves in the autumn wind.' This tone of chastity and self-preservation is very different from 'I do not see the person from last year, my tears wet my silk sleeves.'"</p>
<p>Tang Bohu, who collected the fragrance, went to Ningde's residence to see the chrysanthemums and sadly wrote a quatrain: "For whom do the yellow flowers bloom without being picked? They are lonely in the sparse fence and winding path. They are just traded for rouge and powder with gold coins, and a lifetime of color is entrusted to the west wind." Seeing these solitary and noble yellow flowers in the bleak autumn, many people will be saddened by autumn.</p>

<h3>Reasons for Power Outage in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Explanation from China Merchants Electric Company</p>
<p>We have received your letter forwarding a reader's inquiry regarding the recent frequent temporary power outages in Nanshi, and we are writing to reply. The original power generation equipment of our company has been dismantled and removed by the enemy and puppets and cannot be used. Since the resumption of business, we have been temporarily purchasing electricity from the Shanghai Power Company for supply. Due to the limited amount of electricity purchased and the uneven distribution, we have implemented rotational power outages in different areas to make adjustments. Recently, after the labor unrest occurred at the company, the power generation dropped sharply, and there have been unscheduled power outages since October 1st. During this period, the company repaired the high-pressure boiler, reducing power generation. It was not until October 8th that the power supply in our company's area returned to normal. Our company sincerely apologizes to the users for the impact of the power outages. The newly ordered generators have not yet been fully transported, and the generators that were seized by the enemy and puppets and sent to Beiping and Boshan are still waiting for the Resources Committee to continue to negotiate and implement their speedy recovery. During this transition period, our company, in addition to doing its best to minimize the impact of power outages on users within the possible range, still hopes that all users will understand the difficult situation of our company, and cooperate with us to overcome the difficulties due to the limited electricity supply. It would be most fortunate. Accordingly, we are replying, hoping for your consideration and disclosure! Respectfully, the Editorial Department of the Central Daily News, Social Service Department, Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company.</p>
<h3>Prevention of Tuberculosis Must Not Be Delayed</h3>
<p>Statistics for September at the Hongqiao Sanatorium.</p>
<p>The social service department of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city holds half-price X-ray fluoroscopies every afternoon to promote tuberculosis prevention checks among citizens. According to the statistical report for September, it was found that pulmonary tuberculosis patients still account for more than 20% of the total number, especially among young people aged 15 to 26. Among them, there are many newly admitted university students who, after undergoing X-ray fluoroscopy during physical examinations, were found to have pulmonary tuberculosis lesions. The students did not know it themselves and had no symptoms of illness. Fortunately, they were discovered early, and if appropriate treatment is given in time, they can recover their health, which is a necessary measure for school health and public safety. The statistics of the hospital are as follows: 189 people had varying degrees of pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 20.04%. 261 people had bronchitis, accounting for 27.67%. Others, such as those with blurred shadows, pleural thickening, and deep hilar lymph node shadows, totaled 144 people, accounting for 15.28%. 349 people had normal heart and lungs, accounting for 37.01%.</p>
