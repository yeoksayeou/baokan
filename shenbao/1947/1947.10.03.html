<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本工業水準豈可再予提高？</h3>
<p>四　對日委員會言主席，即美國代表施巴　，日昨報吿日本工業生產的現狀，對于遠東委員會所決議之日本戰后經濟應保持其一九三〇至一九三四年間之水準，猶認爲規定過嚴，不足以供給日本平時之所需。似乎主張還應予以提高。我們看到了這個新聞報　之後，　不知美國若干政治家經濟家的用意何在？前幾天我們接到九月份「亚美利加雜志」，內有美國陸軍部賠償問題顧問史特萊克的一篇「報復即浪費」，根本反對聯合國要求日本賠償，並主張推翻遠東委員會所通過的決議，俾使日本得以保留較高的工業水準。本報已于上月廿九日撰論，予以駁斥。但是史氏的謬論，却能代表美國若干政治家經濟家的見解，施氏就是其中的一個。</p>
<p>施巴應報吿日本工業的現狀，綜合起來，不外乎下述四項：　遠東委員會所決定的日本工業的水準，不免規定過嚴，不足以供給日本平時所需；　日本自投降迄今，在工業方面，已獲得極實際之恢復，今秋之生產量已達一九三〇年至一九三四年間之水準百分之四十五；　締結對日和約及恢復</p>
<p>日本對外貿易，實爲使日本經濟恢復樂觀的唯一方法；　預料在未來的一年之中，日本在其獲取其所需之重要工業原料方面，將有更佳之進步。僅從施氏的報吿看來，也就可以知道日本工業復興的神速與美國對日態度的過分寬大了。不僅使中國感受極大的威脅，　如我國代表團團長商震將軍所說：「在建設日本經濟時，必須防患於未燃，采取相當措　，以防「過去令人不满情形」之重演，而盟方各國在恊助日本恢復其工業之時，尤不應忘懷被日本所摧毀之中國及西太平洋各國之復興工作」。就是在英國代表，聽了施氏的報吿之後，也不免惴惴不安，所以英國代表　氏也說：「日本經濟現雖尙未恢復至足以威脅和平之程度，但對於日本經濟之發展，實有作安全檢查之必要」。</p>
<p>關於日本工業水準問題，不僅牽涉到對日和約的核心問題——日本賠償問題，而且有關中國的安全問題，日來各界討論對日和約問題，莫不重視日本戰后的工業水準問題。杜鲁門總統賠償專員鮑萊，去歲曾親自到日本去，實地考察該國工商經濟情形，返國後嚮總統提出一份報吿　，主張日本未來的工業水準，應以一九二八年爲標準。但經美國國務院研究之後，却認爲鮑萊計劃，足以減低日本人民的生活水準，乃加以修正，將其尺度予以放寬，而主張使日本工業水準恢復至一九三二年的水準。其後遠東委員會迭次開會，討論此一問題，乃決定日本將來的工業水準，應以一九三〇年至一九三四年間之水準爲標準。但至最近，美國又有若干政治家經濟家，認爲遠東委員會所決定的水準，不免規定過嚴，　不足以供給日本平時所需，史施二氏就是這些人的代表，他們的用意究底何在？實在令人費解！</p>
<p>中國對于日本的基本態度，業經我國外交局一再表示，一本寬大爲懷的態度，對於日本決不採取報復主義，惟寬大也要有限度；我們深知對于戰敗國若採取報復態度，則民族間的仇恨愈結愈深，勢必引起戰敗國人民的反感，德國納粹的崛起終致導成第二次世界大戰，就是一個很好的前車之鑑；但若矯枉過正，對於戰敗國一味寬大，甚至跡近姑息，任其迅速復興，保持其侵略的潛力，則其後患無窮，所謂「姑息足以養奸」，盟國當局不可不注意及此，尤其是日本對於美國，採取我國歷史上的「勾踐事吳」的辦法，表面恭順，而實則臥薪嘗胆，無時無刻不欲報仇雪恥。所以我們也曾一再喚起美國朝野的注意，對於日本應該特別提高警覺。平心而論，鮑萊專員的計劃主張未為二八年的水準爲標準，最爲公允；遠東委員會的決定，已不免過高了，怎能再予提高？天津永利化學工業公司總經理候德榜氏，今夏在日兩月，目睹日本復興之迅速，感慨系之，最近曾向報界發表談話稱：「日本工業在美軍的扶植之下，已逐漸恢復戰前水準，鮑萊計劃已被棄置，寬大的史特萊克的反賠償論，更予日本以莫大的鼓勵。」</p>
<p>要之，史施二氏的用意何在？固非對付中國，而另有其作用，但其所造成的後果，適足以威脅中國的安全。所以我們對于這種足以危及遠東和平的謬論，不能不予以　斥！</p>
<h3>工程師年會</h3>
<p>張院長詞</p>
<p>張院長致辭略稱：工程師學會年會前於戰時曾在蓉渝兩地舉行對川省建設有不少成績，使川省獲得建設之基礎，抗戰時期，在抗戰建國綱領中曾闡明抗戰乃爲排除建設之障碍而抗戰可見建設之重要。本年總動員令頒佈以後，本人曾有談話，說明當前實爲破壞與建設力量之爭，目前我國雖已廢除百年來之不平等條約，但如須得到眞正之獨立自由，即必須要以建設來爭取，吾人應大家集中力量來努力建設，以求獲得獨立自由之真諦。張氏繼報吿其此次在東北華北視察之感想，及強調「人才實邊」之重要，略稱：本人此次在收復區中，所有可看之工厰如鞍山鋼鐵厰，小豐滿水電厰等，均前往參觀，調査所得，在抗戰結束前由日人經營時，煤產計東北二七〇〇萬噸，華北一四〇〇萬噸，合併四〇〇〇萬噸以上，今年產二五〇〇萬噸。希望能恢復至三〇〇〇萬噸。其次鐵礦額東北二〇〇萬噸，華北六八萬噸，鋼東北一八〇萬噸，華北一三萬噸，電力東北一八〇萬瓩，華北一五萬瓩，均爲主要工業建設之資源。吾工程師能其遠大計劃，及工程人員之奮鬥，均極堪佩服，尤以張莘夫，兪再麟兩位工程師及最近其次戰役八十三個工程師之遇難，其英勇　神均極可佩可嘉。在今日，吾人實應加强保衛東北華北，同時本人提出「人才實邊」之意見，在目前實迫切需要，因欲談建設，第一是建設，其次是人才，中國之資源，煤在東北，石油在西及北。即广視整個東南亞，其煤過實之佳與量之豐，亦不能超過我大同煤礦，大同之，與英威爾基煤實同好，吾人需加强保護，同時需人來管理，吾人希望工程師能硏究如何加强管理，並盼大家能前往邊地視察，以開發資源，於今日工程師學會年會舉行之日，特以「人才實邊」四字供獻各位。</p>
<p>白祟禧詞</p>
<p>白祟禧氏略談工程與國防之關係，渠稱：抗戰八年，工程建設于國防上極大幫助，如湘桂路之恊助完成　　戰事　進之重大任務，其後桂黔路，陝甘路，均爲重要戰略上有關之工程。在資源上，甘肅玉門之石油礦，及到處設</p>
<p>立之酒精厰，此種資源開發，方能使五百萬軍隊在西南不便利地區作持久戰爭，實爲我工程界之助力。其次白部長分析國際戰爭稱：首次世界大戰尙係陣地戰，第二次大戰則已是科學戰爭的勝利，因科學的發明雷達·火箭炮·原子彈等，始能將戰爭結束。現國防部內設有國防科學委員會，即爲此，盼能與工程界獲得密切之聯繫，同時硏究改良，故吾人工程建設計劃，實應配合國防科學之建設。</p>
<p>翁文灝詞</p>
<p>翁文灝略稱：吾人稱以農立國，但每年缺糧三千萬石，要科學化，但抗戰時尙可製造一千五百瓩之發電機，但勝利后已不能製造，其原因在于大家認爲在勝利后應該舒服而不去努力，故本人認爲工程師應有三個標準，　建設，　前進，　有意義計劃的工作。我們要打倒妨礙建國的人而建設，要充分做有意義有計劃的工作。</p>
<p>陳立夫詞</p>
<p>陳立夫答詞略稱：政府如有更完備之計劃，則工程師將有更大之貢獻，即如在抗戰初起時，工程師參加建築軍事陣地，其英勇並不亞于武裝軍人。但吾人所希望者，爲更具體之計劃，工程師不怕死，今後軍事與工程爲不可分性，必使工程師能有機會爲國家去做，去死。其次，陳氏認爲當前經濟政策與金融政策不能配合，金融政策與工業增產目標走相反途徑，故吾人同時希望經濟方面負責人必硏究怎樣使工業在很合理情況下發展，最后並希望教育方面，能特別爲工程教育多求一點設備。</p>

<h3>征用京滬敵偽房產　撥充公敎人員宿舍　各機關代表商討公敎員待遇</h3>
<p>（上接第一版）本日會議中劉志平，武　煦，陳紫楓等分別發言，對基本數高低，各人看法不同，有人認十五元即足，有人認卅元太少。</p>
<p>監委王冠吾發言，強調工作時間，上下應同甘共苦，不宜再有懸殊不公情形，渠沉痛指出，目前有若干　官要人，食宿僕從槪由公家供給，一個之享受，至少可抵若干公務員，往往部長一人佔屋十間，而小職員則欲求一屋不可得，此种顧上不顧下，與上下不平現象，應予糾正。對於整個待遇問題，渠認除加　以外，對於配發實物，供給住宿，負擔　　與敎育費等，政府皆應以全力行之。不求其　　，而求其普遍，務使人人咸能　受其利。對於住宿，渠又　出一有力建議，主張征用敵僞房產，平均分配各機關公務員。王氏新近自調査敵對僞產業回來，據稱上海一地敵僞房產即逾三千三百幢，皆爲權貴所佔，應予征用。</p>
<p>劉不同不信國庫無款爲公敎人員廣建宿舍，渠舉出一驚人事實稱：某要員最近做壽，四行兩局奉令每家送禮六千萬，六六三十六，一舉手之勢即得三億六千萬，對私人送禮，建公敎人員宿舍即無錢，此話當雖令人心服。</p>
<p>程元　主張應從加薪着手，渠認即使每人加薪一倍，國庫儘有餘力負担，蓋目前國家財政困難，主要由於稅政腐敗，稅款爲經手人中飽所致，政府若能痛下決心，整頓稅收，則以增加所得，爲公務員待遇調整之用，決不　潰乏。原提案人劉志平提出下列　點：　贊成，監院所提以卅元爲基本數，按生活指數發給之辦法，　調整待遇不應僅限於京滬兩地，而應遍及全國，　建築貸款未貸出者應予收回，已貸出者應澈査其使用情形。</p>
<p>與會者發言旣畢，乃逐項時行討論。關於調整薪水辦法，僉主採用監院所提以三十元爲底薪辦法，此三十元按生活指數計算，三十元以上，則按陳立夫氏所提辦法計算，按目前標準約爲五千倍。</p>
<p>配給實物辦法，多數咸主應予繼續，並應擴充到全國各地，至種類則仍爲米·油·鹽·糖·煤·布等七種。程元斟舉出過去實物配給辦　不　情形，油及煤球分配過少，若干官僚資本並藉此發財，故主張僅辦米·煤·佈三種。</p>

<h3>安理會調處國際爭端　列強應放棄速決權　我國向聯大提出正式建議　對希臘問題蔣廷聲明支持美立塲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二日電〕中國今日向聯合國大會正式提議，凡當和解國際爭執時，安理會五大國應即自動放棄其否決權。但並不主張修改聯合國　　，而僅要求明定自動放棄否決權之性質。外交界人士鑒於中國政府近曾發表聲明，主張保留否決權，今茲忽有　舉，殊出意外。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約一日電〕中國代表蔣廷　，今晨在聯大政治與安全委會　明中國對希臘問題之態度。蔣氏稱，中國代表團支持美國關于巴爾幹問題所　之建議，中國與希臘距離雖遠，旦在東南歐亦無直接之物質上關係，然吾人對於希臘之情况，仍感焦慮，因希臘問　所涉及之各種原則，對整個世界之和平與安全極爲重要也。按美國之建議，係主將由大會宣佈阿保南三國有　略希臘罪，並派遣一聯合國委會至巴爾幹，使希臘邊恢復和平。蔣氏並稱、若干理論認為希臘問題係起因於英美之援助希臘，然聯合國　　或國際法均未規定禁止一政府援助他政府，或接受他政府之援助，因之希臘之接受英美援助，其他政府在法律上無不滿之理由。吾人更不能接受若干理論中所述因美英援希，希臘之　鄰國即可以武力協助希臘國內反對派之意見，此種理論若為吾人承認，則將召致無政府主義。本屆大會實　向世界　明吾人遵守國際法上人人承認之原則，而其中最重要之一端，即為任一國家不能援助　　動其他國家內之叛亂活動。</p>

<h3>當局商定電車工潮對策　限今日一律復工　否則無條件解雇　接替工人準備就緒立可出動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政當局爲處理法商電車工潮，於昨日下午四時，在社會局會議室召開重要會議。出席吳市長，社會局長吳開先，公用局長趙曾珏，工人福利委員會主任委員陸京士，警察局長兪叔平，總工會理事長水祥雲，社會局勞工處長沈鼎等。法商水電公司法籍大班及人事科長亦列席參加。會議至五時三刻始畢，會後吳市畏吳局長接見記者，吳市長稱：法商電車工潮拖延數日，大多數善良工人因受外來威脅，不能恢復工作。當局爲公衆利益着想，公共交通不能長此停頓，故曾通知職工如不復工，將予無條件解　，政府並準備一切，公共汽車可由駕駛兵團士兵駕駛，電車可由失業工人遞工作。但至今工人仍延不復工，故由公司於今晚（指昨晚）發出通吿，限所有工人一律於三日復工，否則無條件解僱。四日起，社會局將即將命準備就緒之工人開始工作，並另外招僱新工人。政府採取此項辦法，並非對工人太兇，祇因已警吿多次而工人仍不復工，不能再拖延，爲公衆利益着想，不能不如此辦。吳市長繼申述此次所欲逮捕人員名單已經公佈，此項名單係在富通印刷所搜獲，其在逃者已囑各保田設法授集繪製相片圖形，定予緝捕。其不在公佈名單內之工人，希望勿聽信謠言。凡善良工人受摘亂份子威脅者可至警局報吿，市府已下令各警局予以保護。現搗亂份子正使用苦肉計，利用被捕工人家屬至工廠哭哭啼啼攔阻工人上工。此輩冢屬如有寬枉，儘可至社會局或市政府申訴解釋，今後如再有上述哭阻情形，亦視爲搗亂行爲，加以逮捕。政府對善良工人決予保護，但如在逮捕名單外之工人而與逮捕名單中人勾結來往者，亦予嚴辦。吳市長最後希望法商電軍善良工人能不怕威脅於今日復工，並表示在上海對任何搗亂份子之威脅，皆可鎭壓。</p>
<p>騎巡隊警察保護復工工人</p>
<p>吳局長繼補充報告，政府已盡最大決心，調派所有　巡隊，警察，及便衣警察，保障復工人及其家屬，使安心工作。任何復工工人或其家屬如受成脅，可隨時報吿警局，當局對咸脅人員定予嚴懲。吳局長並表示，法電工人如過今日之限期後再復工，將以新工人待遇錄用，過去所有服務年資不計。</p>
<p>又據吳局長吿記者，社會局前令法商電車公司開除之朱俊欣等十六人，均在通緝之列。</p>
<h3>職工舉行大會　多數願復工　散會離廠受陰作罷　發傳單煽動犯被捕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕法商電車公共汽車昨日上午未出廠，下午局部復工，開出二十餘輛。職員於前晚曾推派代表往謁社會局吳局長，表示昨日可正式復工，但希望社會局所派出之開車工人不再工作，否則恐工人因職務被奪發生誤會而不能復工。吳局長當表示職工如可復工，則派出開車之工人可予稍待，並爲避免刺激原有工人，即令派出開車之工人不進車廠，另駐他處候待。昨日上午十時職工在廠內召開大會，出應四百餘人，一部份職工仍提出釋放被捕工人等要求。但多數出席工人在勸導下表示顧意復工，並允於返家穿着號衣後下午即可復工。廠內負責方面當即於十時半開出定備車無軌電車一一輛，有軌電車一輛，公共汽車一輛作為接送復工工人之用。散會後與會工人相繼離廠時，有四十五號撬路工人在車廠南建國東路郵局附近散發「上海電力公司法商電車公司罷工委員會」之吿社曾人士書及法電工會之「吿會員書」，經附近軍警發現將其逮捕。而原定下午到廠復工之工人，則因此又吿作罷。社會局乃於下午仍派準備就純之工人開車出廠，維持交通。每車有武裝警察二名隨車保護，　價不諭遠近，仍一律收一千元。</p>
<h3>公司通告　漏夜送出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕法商電車公司昨晚發出通吿，限工人於三日復工，謂否則決予開革，另僱人員接替工作。所有解　人員一律依自動離職論，舉凡一切解僱退職等優待辦法，均予取消。上項通吿經油印後，由社會局漏夜派人按址送達各職工家中。</p>
<h3>發電廠復常　千餘工人全部到廠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美商電力公司楊樹浦發電廠，昨日已完全恢復常態。據該工會整理委員會負責人稱：全日到廠之工人共一千一百十人。發電機部份除二人吿病假外，餘均進時到廠工作。發電量亦已增加。前日晚間南市，及舊法租界一部份地區停電，係電廠發電量驟然減少，公司自動關閉上述地區電流者，外傳電綫被三十等說均不確。另悉：　朋路楡林路口有電力方棚問一所，昨日曾遭破壊，旋經修復。楡林路警察分局及警備司令部已加派員警保護，並嚴査企圖破壊電力之奸徒。</p>
<h3>氣象台函參會辯白　天氣豫告並無不確</h3>

<h3>新訂商業登記法　各項規定甚詳盡　奚玉書陳霆銳等意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自報端載經濟部新訂商業登記法草案要點後，記者特走詢會計師奚玉畫氏，承發表意見，略謂：辦法對於商業範圍，採用定義式之規定，而不用列舉式，可免褂一漏萬之弊病。辦法將創設或變更以外之登記，應於創設時或變更時同時登記。如此規定，商店之性質，主管機關易於調査，社會亦易於瞭解。如本市商店之用冠生園名義者在十家以上，但據本人所知，大部均爲代理性質，而外界則不甚明瞭。執此一例，可見經理人，代辦人，合夥等登記，實爲必要。又陳霆銳律師發表意見，謂新法中對各登記規定，甚爲詳盡。並稱我國進行戰後大規模建設工作，原則上應偕重外國之技術與資本，惟目前一部份國人之心理，仍以外國經濟侵略為慮，實可不必。蓋自領事裁判權取消後，如能有嚴格之商業管理，過去之伎略必不能重見於今日。消極的反對國際經濟合作，實非明智之舉</p>

<h3>靑市審奸貪污案　刁復墀嫌疑重大　丁敬臣納賄八億　買自由重陷縲絏</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島卄八日航訊〕靑市頃發現山東高等法院第二分院檢察處檢察官刁復墀等貪污八億元舞弊案，刁已於本月八日停職交保偵察，日前據息已飛濟南候訊。茲誌此案始末於后：</p>
<p>經濟漢奸丁敬臣，係靑島淪陷時期大阜銀行董事長，該行爲偽組織官商合辦。勝利以後，丁被檢舉，高二分院檢察處（首席檢察官係朱巍然）於偵査此案時，丁頗受優待，每次偵訊，均係刁親往看守所，並不過堂。外間早有煩言·此案遷延至去年十月，檢察處竟認爲犯罪嫌疑不足，予以不起訴處分，輿諭始大譁，本地報紙紛加記載，咸謂「丁敬臣不是漢奸，則誰才是漢奸？」其間高二分檢處且曾函某報更正，謂此案完全按法律辦理，如以丁爲漢奸，應舉證據云云，益令人不滿。市參議會遂函請司法行政部解釋，復函確認大阜銀行爲漢奸銀行，丁敬臣爲經濟漢奸。</p>
<p>濟南方面，亦有人向高等法院檢舉丁敬臣，山東省參議會亦函高院請高二分檢處澈査。高院遂於十月十八日函高二分檢處稱：「案査本院受理丁敬臣等漢奸一案，據報被吿丁敬臣一各，類在靑被捕，並經貴處偵査終結，認爲犯罪嫌疑不足，論知不起訴在案，相應函達査照，希將該案全卷檢送過院，以憑辦理。又被告如未交保，請暫于覊押，如已交保，亦祈追加相當金額之保證金，以昭愼重。」詎料丁敬臣於高二分檢處宣佈不起訴處分之日，即離靑島，搭機飛往上海，行動迅速，出人意外。後査得丁住上海林森中路一二三號，並不時至中正北一路九十四號郁采藥醫師診療所診病，乃電請滬高院檢察處將丁歸案。至十月廿六日，滬處將丁覊押，解靑轉濟。</p>
<p>丁在濟偵査期間，據悉已將全部賄賂情形和盤托出，靑市高二分院分檢處各處都用到了錢，總計達八億元（去年幣値）。丁原期出錢買免於縲絏，今竟仍失自由，有所不甘，檢察處現雖在「秘密」偵查期間，但道途傳聞，此案業已喧騰靑濟矣。</p>
<p>本年六月，濟高法院院長胡績，據悉即曾爲此案來靑一行。至本月八日，始將主辦檢察官刁復墀停職交保偵査。據高二分院息，刁已於日前飛濟，此案內幕複雜，牽涉頗廣。（特派員邵愼之）</p>
<h3>南洋樹膠跌價　海南僑胞回國</h3>
<p>〔本報海南島廿八日航訊〕月來本島僑胞，回國多於出國，此種現象，尤以馬來亞半島方面爲甚。據僑務局中人談其原因，大致由於：　樹膠跌價，前時樹膠每担價格，約爲叨幣卅五元，且曾一度漲至卅八元，因樹膠市情暢銷，一般華僑工人，均有工作，生活尙稱安定，但月前市價僅爲叨幣廿五元左右，樹膠工塲因貨品價賤，難以爲繼，縱不致倒閉，亦因成本關係，大量裁員，是以失業華僑日衆，此爲迫使華僑紛紛回國之一大原因。　糧食問題，馬來亞方面華僑糧食，多靠黑市供給，現因黑市米價上漲，一般華僑，不易購取，紛紛返國，另謀出路。至僑匯問題，基於上述兩種原因，聞亦銳减，此爲目前馬來亞華僑之嚴重危機，惟據記者自各方探悉：出國赴星華僑，雖吿减少，惟有一畸形現象，即中年及壯年男子赴星洲者甚少，老弱婦孺反較多，蓋因英政府所發之入口證，限制甚嚴。至赴緬華橋自緬甸代表宇呑貌抵瓊辦理瓊僑復員緬甸後，新客出國者，亦如鳳毛麟角。</p>

<h3>懷胎十二月　產下奇女孩</h3>
<p>〔本報海南島廿四日航訊〕海南島澄邁縣屬大坡村民廖富興之妻，於九月十二日一胎產下兩孩，一男一女，男孩一切正常，並無其他，惟女孩於墜地後，口內上下牙齒均甚完整，前齒較長，頭面作銀白色，狀如成年之少女，頗饒鑒韻。市民聞訊，即爭先恐後，均以一睹爲快。翌日，該產婦以生女如此，實爲不祥之徽兆，乃將女孩私自壓死。聞該婦懷孕期間，幾及十二月，始吿分娩。</p>
<h3>萬人爭看八堡潮　潮神生日前夕盛况不减往年</h3>
<p>〔本報海寗一日訊〕今日爲農曆八月十八「潮神生日」前夕。十區各縣記者及團務人員，均由長安前赴八堡看潮，淸寂已久之海寗城廂顯得十分熟鬧。行人熈熈攘攘，四鄉農民雲集，午時潮來，八堡塘熱鬧不堪。中國旅行社，公路總局，均搭有觀潮台，而一般臨時商店，設備雖頗簡陋，生意則興隆百倍。人頭擁擠，不弱往年，惟潮勢已無昔日雄姿，潮過後，滬杭公路上車行如飛，行人如織，「人潮」遠較「海潮」兇湧。小普陀善信男女，亦已齊集此間，將「宿夜」三天。明日爲「潮神生日」，預料盛况將更見展開。</p>
<p>〔本報海寗一日訊〕記者能在廢曆八月十八日歷次得見大潮的奔騰，堪稱生平幸事。爲了顧慮到明年或者再也看不到大潮，爲了追懷着往年的盛景壯觀，願意借一角的篇幅，記述潮神生日的種種盛况。</p>
<p>本報杭州電訊稱：廢曆八月十八爲最高潮，看潮盛况勢將逾於明年，蓋江流改向，海寗潮頭已小，預料明年殆將無潮可看云云，實際上，考我國古代習俗，我們的祖先都相信着潮神生日的潮頭最大，所以遂有八月十八爲最高潮的想法，眞正的大潮，可能是在八月十八日前後，並非一定是八月十八日那天。到南宋時代，官家定潮神生日爲檢閱水兵之期，這就使民間傾城前往，大有「看了海潮看人潮」之感。</p>
<p>潮來時的情景，大抵是如此：先是突然有澌澌的聲音從遠處響來，這時滔滔的白浪開始從天際飛奔過來，像千萬朶白雲衝出灰色的雲闡。白紙碎裂似的澌澌的聲昔，也一霎時變爲瀑布傾潟似的淙淙聲了。</p>
<p>轉眼之間，潮頭却好像千軍萬馬一樣地奔馳；接着是潮聲沸騰；如獅吼，如虎嘯，一變而爲羣獸齊鳴。這時，看潮的人們禁不住掀起一陣不寒而慄的感覺，肅然屛息地站着，各人的視綫都會凝注在那一股來不及　摸的潮頭上了。潮頭快速地逼近眼前來，像是挾着傾山倒海的巨大力量，在作洶湧翻騰的千姿萬態，立刻會發出天崩地裂似的巨響，震撼著江面和江岸。白浪像神話中的巨獸，以閃電式的姿態滾過眼前。江邊的水立即增高了七八尺。</p>
<p>附近廟宇內傳來悠揚的笛聲，江畔的農民和漁民們向潮頭（在他們的觀念中是潮神）膜拜，爆竹聲一時在江邊齊發。</p>
<p>迎着潮頭的漁船也躍上潮身，趾高氣揚地順着風勢，向逆流中疾駛而去。這一幕觀潮的壯劇，就在悠揚的樂聲中結束。武陵舊事記浙江潮如下：「方其遠出海門，僅如銀綫，旣而漸近，則玉城雪嶺，際天而來，大聲如雷霆，震撼激射，呑天沃日。」（周密）可以看出宋朝浙江巨潮的雄豪的姿態。拾翠餘談中說：「初望之，一片靑氣，稍近，則茫茫白色，其際如雷，其勢如山，怒吼狂奔，一瞬至岸，如崩山倒屋之狀，三躍而定，則橫江千里，永天一色矣。」（汪珂玉）至於夜潮奇景，，四時出賞錄曾有一段記載：「風色陡寒，海門潮起，月影銀濤，光搖噴雪，雲移玉岸，浪捲轟，白練風揚，奔飛曲折，勢若山岳奔騰，使人毛骨欲　。」（高濂）</p>

<p>今日起各組總決賽開始，其緊張情形，當遠勝複賽，各組均爲本季網球界之精粹，此一會賽，自爲各方所密切注目。</p>
<p>今日決賽秩序高震川對孫沂方（中單）三時半陶冠球對李國瑤（混雙）四時半朱芝英對潘綠英（混雙）四時半</p>
<p>今日再塲</p>
<p>第一塲中級單打決賽，綠燈會之高震川，與金蘭會之孫沂方爭霸，高去年曾達決賽週，今年球藝大進，孫沂方爲牛皮糖作風，功夫深湛。第二塲混合雙打決賽，陶冠球朱芝英組對李國璠潘綠英組，旗鼓相當，是賽勝負殊難預卜。</p>
<p>獎品豐富</p>

<p>昨日之戰</p>
<p>昨日陶麥之役，進行之速，殊出意外。麥克拉根一反日前兇狠作風，變爲柔順之羔羊，出球不急，頻投綱，或野逸，其關鍵由於雨後地鬆，球之彈力較遜，其唯一拿手傑作之正抽，遂不能發揮，再以經騐不足，且不能上綱，乃致於一籌莫展。陶第一盤全勝六局，第二三兩盤，各失一局，費時僅三刻鐘。</p>

<h3>華隊七雄參加角逐　港足球聯賽揭幕　南華早慘敗傑志勝巴士　中華得勝東方光華受挫</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕秋高氣爽，正是足球季節，香港一九四七——四八年度足球聯賽，繼木盾賽後揭幕了。本屆聯賽甲組十五隊參加奪標，華隊佔其七，爲：星島，傑志，巴士，東方，南華，光華，中華。乙組則分兩組混戰，球塲也比去年多了兩個，計香港方面有南華會，海軍塲，香港會與及新開放的陸軍塲，九龍那邊也有一個警察塲。</p>
<p>實力觀測</p>
<p>經過了週末的演出，各隊的實力已經現了面目，西隊最强的是迪雲陸軍，其次是燕尼斯和砲兵。華隊呢，星島遠征未回，南華大軍雖全師凱旋，又因球員待遇問題，無法成軍，所以大部好手還沒有在球塲露面，看來組軍還會有大變動。聯賽是變循環制，將來爭鬥必烈。</p>
<p>傑志首捷</p>
<p>廿七日星期六，聯賽開羅，甲組四塲，最重要一戰是兩新升甲組華隊碰頭，傑志在警察塲鬥巴士隊，巴士有國脚四雙，李天生，麥紹漢，譚江柏，卓石金，傑志則以去年星島乙爲基幹，配上郭英祺，劉·材等成軍。</p>

<p>鍾景生　卓石金　譚江柏　張松根　錢熾輝</p>
<p>開戰後，十五分鐘，巴士尙能支擰，前尘時，傑志以三對〇受遙領。換過防，郭英麒罰入十二碼，四對零，巴士始由譚江柏遠射破蛋，最後，傑志鄧廣森吊入，五比一終塲。</p>
<p>南華慘敗</p>
<p>南華則在海軍塲戰燕尼斯，南華因組軍不成，草草出戰，六比一大敗，爲南華看史以來之慘敗。</p>
<p>另外兩幕洋兵內閧，砲兵凈勝海軍六球，香港會則以四比一　倒警察。</p>

<h3>新外匯政策收效　出口業日有起色　變更遠期外匯利息有利出口商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯基金平衡委員會某負責人，昨就日前該會核定變更遠期外匯利息，解釋其重要性，遠期外匯利息，原規定爲每月四分，現改爲第一個月八分，第二個月一角一分，第三個月一角五分，三月期遠期外匯利息，共須三角四分。</p>
<p>渠稱：此舉主旨，在增加遠期外匯之利息負担，而减少進口商之大量套購遠期外匯。對出口商則有帮助，蓋出口商如帶資金，仍可憑信用證書，向行局先期貸款。</p>
<p>渠指出；在平衡委員會成立後四週內之出口貨總値，較戰前逐月平均之出口貨値，有過之無不及。最近兩週來之出口貨値，復與過去四週間逐週平均之出口貨値相平衡。可見出口情形，確屬好轉。且現已屆出口季節，設運輸不受意外阻滯，則出口情形，將日見推廣。</p>
<p>最近我國出口貨之世界市價，除桐油外，並未見有顯著之貶跌。按桐油在中信局辦理收購時，每磅僅美金二角，後逐步坩加至二角五分，最近因港方某桐油商拋空二千噸，致又暴跌至二角二分。惟市價現已逐步好轉，猪　市價尙屬平穩。</p>
<h3>多方了結者衆　華股情勢恍惚</h3>
<p>華股昨逢現遞轉期之日多方終吿氣餒，紛紛在即交中了結，前市終以低檔結束，午後場外買戶忽殷，廣帮力購，轉呈穩定之象，交易不多，前途仍在撲朔迷離中。</p>
<p>晨初平疲，永紗開後立吿下游，跌至即交二六〇元，遞交二七〇元。十時一刻後，趁低有買，略有掙扎，但未幾場外息價仍站二角七分及三角一分半高價，出售者多，再迫低至二六〇元及二七〇元。旋以進者稍暢，拉上至二六四元及二七五元，但傳說工潮嚴重，存多在場外斬售，亭鼠盡量在塲內套賣，斬售者接踵，近午步降至二五五元及二六五元低價，遞交以二六七元之價收市，收後遞永紗喊低少許，結果較前收即交股計永紗內衣麗安景綸火柴中紡閘北恒豐微挫，信和美亞華豐新光景福中法勤興中絲統益榮豐華新各跌半成，新華跌一成，遞交股計永紗微升，信和微跌，華　跌半成。</p>
<p>午後迭有吸納，國行差進不多，永紗步漲到即交二六〇元，　交二六八元半高價，始有賣出，而後，以二五八元及二六八元之價收市，結果較最收即交股計永紗信和美亞新光景福內衣微升，華豐新華火柴新亞恒豐中紡閘北統益榮豐平平，勤興中絲微降，華新再跌半成，離溢價更遠，遞交股計信和尙平，永紗量福微升，美亞華豐新光微挫，場外各老股計再跌少許。</p>
<p>現遞轉期，昨套利息價約一角六至二角有零，多頭不願負擔貼價，是以初高繼低，銀行帮貼進，但多方未見擁擠。永紗最開十一元，自十一元半退至九元半結束，美亞自十八元半退至十四元，而以十四元半收市，信和自六元半降至四元半。</p>
<h3>統債疲軟　外股盤旋</h3>
<p>公債昨稍疲軟，五五五室五五二室雖進，三六〇室五〇三則出。統丙晨開一五五〇〇元自一五〇〇〇元起，盤上至一六五〇〇元而後始平。結果較前收計甲乙低三百元，丙跌四百元，丁挫一百元，統戊平平，成交五百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨再盤局，洋商出入不一，證劵帮賣出，廣帮則扒。怡紗晨開一二七〇〇〇元，低價一二六五〇〇元，高價一二八五〇〇元，午後平庸而已。結果較前收計業廣跌半成，會德豐航業尙平，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>戰前債務　償還辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕聯合徵信所訊，頃據關係方面語記渚，前日政務會議所通過之戰前債務償還辦法，僅適用于私人與行莊所發生價務關係之淸理，至于國家所發行之公債，個人與個人間之債務，及政府機關與行莊所發生之債務關係，均不適用。</p>
<h3>食米來源暢旺　粳秈趨勢疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市，共到米糧一萬七千一百餘石，南市早市粳秈均見下挫，午時轉定，結果粳秈仍趨疲勢，回跌三五千至萬元。北市初開緊俏，午時亦然轉懈，終以到源湧塞，依然不振。南市滬北河下積存米船三百餘艘，約計三萬餘石，後形恐難同榮。</p>
<p>麵粉外埠來貨踵接，市化呆滯，回跌三四千元。統粉雜牌粉均挫三五千元，配粉價格不動，但已較市塲各粉爲高，故申請者極少。麩皮實銷不振，回低千元。豆餅油頭不動，挫落千餘元。黃豆油廠本街相繼收購，貨稀形堅，步砌三五千元，後情仍看挺秀。菉豆南洋納胃冷懈，步削六七千元。</p>
<p>莞豆汕頭去化若繼若繼，申地存到兩稀，伕然牢硬。蠶豆客方進胃已經滿額，零化略見穩定之格。紅糧酒坊收吸，市面堅定。苞米北方甚懈，趨勢軟化。生仁客銷不動，本街平常，惟來貨不多，陳貨平正，新貨提升萬元。芝蔴去化活潑，賡續上楊，續漲一二萬元。</p>
<p>油市升沉不一，生油消化仍活，依然挺秀。蔴油則回挫萬元。菜油供多於求，猛削二三萬元。豆油平疲之格，淸油跟低萬元，配油繼續辦理。</p>
<h3>外銷茶稍活動</h3>
<p>日前本市茶商向北非方面推銷之抽珍，珍眉等綠茶，刻下一部份已有出路，致昨市買氣漸露端倪，而成交數量，則在特貨者扳持中，依然零星做開。行情雖未顯著進展，但比前咸帶穩挺。</p>
<p>祁門紅茶，賣戶喊價亦一致砌加一二成不等，惜進購者鑒於國外需周不强，且出價慳吝，是以猶不願急切求取，過程頗有吐納擯持之局。</p>
<p>各種內銷茶，除天津一帶去化賡續滯呆外，餘如本街店莊及蘇錫等地，銷路仍暢，市勢向上。</p>
<h3>食糖步鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市縐勢仍軟，小二萬元至數千元不一。公會劃盤，現貨二〇中砂白七十八萬七千元，台赤七十八萬元，油提　六十八九萬元，興化白七十七萬元，　裝七十二三萬元。興赤六十六七萬元，海南赤六十九萬元，泉州洋白七十萬元，台靑六十五萬元，刁靑六十五萬五千元，共成交千數件。</p>

<p>粗紗挺秀</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨初需胃不爽，嗣因價低，本街及客帮稍有進取，市微回上。最後四二支藍鳳紗比上日軋跌四十萬，爲二千五百廿五萬元。廿支　馬步升四十萬，特變馬軋升十萬元，十六支紗價平疲，全日趨勢粗紗去化較活，市呈俏秀，細紗則萎靡無神。</p>
<p>棉布呆滯</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因各方銀根尚緊，進戶閑散，塲內轉賣頗多，市呈盤旋，全日市勢，除熱銷之龍頭等各細布及嗶嘰直貢漂布灰斜，行情步好二三千至一二萬元外，其餘各布無甚榮辱。</p>
<p>現棉回升</p>
<p>昨日現棉紗廠徽有吸胃，同業均有進意，市况轉平，價格較上日稍升，全日成交一千一百餘包。</p>

<p>人迭絲昨市頗形閒散，交易極爲淸淡，行情穩定。一二〇號高山有光，上午市價爲四千五百三十萬元，下午五百卅萬元，東洋五百八十萬元，與上日價軋平。</p>
<p>廠經仍因銀根尙未鬆懈，交易異常靜寂，各級喊價維持原盤，五担頭俱乏做開，另担成交價與上日同，干經喊價，不無上落。</p>
<p>綢貨個絲披面昨市大誠與華輩貨開盤在七百十二三萬元之間，終因間業中銀根關係，賣多於買，逐漸下挫。中途在零四五萬元盤旋甚久，交易尙稱熱絡。收市時即期做七百萬元，隔日十五萬元，最小價曾進七百萬元關內，結果與上日情形相仿。格子璧縐喊價未動，並無成交，其餘各貨，大致平疲。</p>

<h3>第四病　像猩紅熱實非猩紅熱的小兒傳染病</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>近來本市有些小兒患一種傳染病，發熱發紅疹，外表好像猩紅熱；但實際並不是猩紅熱，也沒有猩紅熱那樣嚴重。這呌做第四病（Foarth　disease）也稱費拉托，杜克氏病（Filatou　Duke's　disease）在西曆一九〇〇年英國醫院杜克氏首先記載。但其前數年俄國醫者費拉托氏也曾經報吿過，所以把兩位名字並列一起而稱他爲費拉托·杜克　病。</p>
<p>這種病的原因，今日還沒有明瞭，有許多人主張說是屬於風疹一類的病。其實和風疹是不同的。</p>
<p>傳染的對象，大都是小兒。受了傳染之後，必須經過九天到三星期的潛伏期，　覺有輕熟，同時身上發出紅疹。但也有先來頭痛和惡心的。發疹是薔薇紅色的小斑，從口唇鼻部開始，漸漸波及到胸部，上肢，腹部和下肢而到全身。這些紅疹，並不隆起於皮面。也沒有黏膜內疹。不過眼結合膜和咽喉，稍見充血罷了。頸淋巴腺雖有肺脹，但程度更比風疹為輕，發疹到二三天就褪去。後來也沒有皮膚的皮膚沉着。脫皮像糠粃狀。一二星期之完全落層。</p>
<p>病兒並不覺得怎樣不舒服，病中沒有什麼合併症或後貽症。</p>
<p>病勢雖很輕，但診斷很不容易。因爲非常像風疹或猩紅熱。在發病的中間，診斷便不難。</p>
<p>因爲這種病，是沒有危險性存在，所以治療，也毋須用什麽藥，祇是注意他的過程和營養就行。</p>
<h3>百日咳之重要性及其療法（續完）</h3>
<p>— 壽再梧</p>
<p>第二期，時間最長咳嗽較重，有黏厚之痰液，咳時作痙　狀，面部緊張，面色紅紫，咳後吸入深長之氣，咳時嗽聲不絕，項背媼屈，及咳聲稍定，痰液與食物交吐，至胃空爲止。白晝較輕晚間更重。</p>
<p>第三期，爲痊愈期，咳嗽漸輕，陣發性顯著减退，痰液易於咳出，無嘔吐，能飲食，晚間睡眠較好，病體漸見起色。</p>
<p>百日咳之重要性，不僅在本病之長期咳嗽，消耗體力，時嘗嘔吐，損失營養，夜間頻咳，擾攘睡眠，並因物理性之頓咳，致胸部肌肉，舒縮無定，肺部及氣管支，直接受外界壓力之影響，引起血液內氯氣交換之不足，局部肺臟之充血，其結果適足以造成鼻出血，喉出血，氣管粘膜破碎而出血，肺組織穿孔而成肺氣喠，皮下氣腫，眼結合膜出血，眼球體出血，眼底視網膜出血。耳部出血，腦膜出血，尤爲本病重要之誘發病。或則四肢痙孿，或則左右偏癱，或則昏迷復蘇，或則心臓衰弱，或則神枯力竭。種種原因，可以招致死亡。其有軟骨病之因素者，成爲肺門結核。已有肺門結核之沾染者，成為活動性而沉重之肺癆。他若粟粒性（即彌漫性）肺結核，腸結核，往往可由百日咳演變而成。至於慢性腦膜炎之誘發，亦爲本病常見之事實。曾見新聞報長行廣吿登載巨額診金，縣賞徵求治愈慢性腦膜炎之病家數次，結果諒必難能如願。幼小之乳兒，偶染本病，易轉肺炎，尤以三個月以下之小兒爲最，故危險特甚。昔見某雜誌載孕婦臨盆前患百日咳，嬰兒下地時，亦患百日咳，足徵本病重要性之所在。</p>
<p>治療之法，百日咳患兒，首須隔離。如在學校內，敎師應令其回家治療，俟痊復後，再行來校。如在家庭，應將未患小兒，分別居住，分別飮食。住處首須寬暢，空氣流通，夏不過凉，冬不過熱。三餐飲食，除不易消化及刺激性外，均可給與。米粥，米飯，蔬菜，牛乳，肉類，均可隨意食用。嘔吐劇烈時，流貿易於吐出，半固體食物，反較妥當，吐出後重復喂食。治咳以內服胃隨時期而異。退熱以注射藥為主。百日咳疫苗早期預防或有佳有時則否。如有肺結核之傾向或嫌疑者Stryptomycin試用之價値。惟後者價格奇昂，且須持續注射，爲一般普通病家所難能負担，未免美中不足。酌量使用，百日癆賴以治愈者不在少數。</p>
<p>總之，百日咳一症，在我國社會中，向認為無足重輕之疾病，初發之際不加注意，稍有智識之家庭，恒以白松糖漿，止咳露，克利西佛等成藥服之。積週累月，病勢日深，再行求醫則自難痊愈。亦有以杏仁冲汁內服，麻雀煎湯內服，驚　取涎內服等等，稱曰單方者，此種非理化之療法，畢竟何能見效。王家嫂嫂謂此方確有道理。張家奶奶謂此方非常靈騐，就診病人謂單方土法，已一一試過，元一有效。以此例彼，功效可知。在新醫發達之今日，百日咳一症，雖無隨治隨愈，得心應手，尅日見功之特效藥，要之，縮短病期，减少痛苦，免除危害，亦未始非本症修治之目標。隔壁阿奶謂百日咳見血時，不醫自愈。山東老鄕謂我家小孩，三天就愈。此皆無稽之談，不足深信。曾見小三子患百日咳。歷八個月未愈，先後見血三次，計十餘日之久，仍由悉心診治而就健。至於輕微之症，醫治自較順利，但不藥而愈者，究有幾人。據臨診經騐，百日咳之治愈者，約占百分之七十以上，惟所需之時間，爲本症治療上唯一之焦點。</p>
<h3>傷寒病人的預後和看護</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>人們每每談到親友間疾病的時候，如果知道是傷風發熱，大家多不甚注意，以爲傷風發熱不至于發生甚麼危險；如果一聽到是傷寒，臉上的情緖，就不免十分緊張起來，爲甚麼呢？因爲傷寒病有致死的可能，就是幸而不死，至少也要臥床一月二月。目下是夏末秋初，正是傷寒病流行的季節，究竟患了傷寒病以後，有怎樣的危險！想這是大家都要知道的事情。</p>
<p>講到患傷寒病以後，有沒有危險和危險是怎樣的程度，這在醫學上呌做預後。傷寒病人的預後，當然不許樂觀，因爲有許多病勢很輕的患者，有忽然發生腸出血腸穿孔以致死亡的事情，吾們從一般的現象，可以得到下述的結論：</p>
<p>全身症狀例如熱度很高，早最也恃續在四〇度以上；同時脈搏細速，恃續在一百廿以上的時候，預後犬多危險。</p>
<p>神經症候劇甚，撮空摸床，狂躁不安，高聲怒駡，四周亂打，或則神志昏迷，　語喃喃，甚至劇烈頭痛，角弓反張，知覺過敏，項部强直，有似腦膜炎的時候，這呌做假性腦膜炎或傷寒性腦膜炎，預後大多危險。</p>
<p>傷寒的時候，大多合併氣管或氣管枝炎，如果在甫症傷寒的時候，病人意識　濁濁，氣管枝內分泌物的喀出困難，並且常在橫臥的狀態，容易發起高度的氣管枝炎，這樣細小的氣管枝炎，很容易引起氣管枝肺炎，繼續引起沈降性肺炎或吸引性肺炎，也是一種危險的事情。</p>
<p>在傷寒病的時候，尿中往往有些蛋白質（0.5%以下），如果蛋白質增加，尿量减少，尿中有血和圓柱體的時候，那就是合併腎臟炎，預後也不良。</p>
<p>素質和個人的素因，也有關係，小兒傷寒的腸穿孔和腸出血，比較大人爲少，至於腦症候有時雖則很凶，但是預後比校大人爲優良。老年人的傷寒，熱度雖不很高，但是他的腦症候呼吸和循環障碍，大多劇甚，所以多取不良的轉歸。肥胖者，好飲者他的心臟機能。往往很弱，所以預後也不良。（未完）</p>

<h3>談守財奴</h3>
<p>— 齊平</p>
<p>守財奴的確自有其不可及的地方，譬如說，他們大多數是白手成家的人物，從小起便和社會奮鬥，那種堅苦卓絕的精神就頗可令人欽佩。不過，話又要說回來了，「人生若夢，爲歡幾何？」像他們那種「克己」的程度，也實在太自苦了！</p>
<p>美國紐約大學。敎授派生斯博士是一位專門研究守財奴的人，他所搜集的有關守財奴的資料，堪稱世界無雙。而他對於這一門多年研究的結論，却就是：守財奴大多命苦！</p>
<p>最苦命的守財奴，要算是十九世紀時法國富豪福居。他把生平積聚的財富窖藏起來，在地窖口還特地裝好了一扇秘密門，外面人絕對無法知道。不料有一天深夜，他點了蠟燭去數錢的時候，忽然一陣風把那扇秘密門砰地關上，福居竟就生生的活埋在地窖裏！外面人根本就不知道他到什麼地方去了，而天下守財奴都是離羣索居的人，別人自然也就不來關心那些吝嗇鬼的生死存亡。事隔多年，有人買下了這宅房子，想造一個酒窖，才在無意中發現了餓死在這大宗藏金旁邊的福居先生——可憐，那支蠟燭已給他嚼去了大半截，運他身上的肉，都給他自己啃去了不少！</p>
<p>英國在中世紀有一個守財奴名呌歐佛斯。此公孑然一身，藏金獨富，對僕人們一向是極度懷疑的，唯恐他們耍覬覦他的財富。照那時的習尙。凡遇喪率僕人們不須節食誌哀。於是歐佛斯靈機一動，立刻裝死，以便節省開支。不想他的僕人却不講這些，主人一死，倒反而放胆大吃起來了。歐佛斯在靈牀上偷偸覷見，不禁怒火中燒，直挺挺地豎了起來。那位僕人祗當是活鬼出現，便拿起一把靠在牆邊的鐵耙對準了主人猛力打下去——這一下，歐佛斯可眞的是死了。</p>
<p>英國還有一位八十歲的老鰥夫，在病重的時候去找醫生，醫生勸他稍爲喝一點酒。這位老翁大吃一驚，原來他在家裏正窖藏了無數上等美酒，唯恐給別人知道，另外出錢去沽一點罷——錢又是好東西，一定捨不得。他終於讓步了，自己一步一挨地走到酒害裏去，不想年老力衰，跌了一交，馬上送命。</p>
<p>百年前，巴黎有一個神經過敏的商人，他忽然感覺到這世界上一定要有一次白塔油恐慌，就把全部財產去買了白塔油囤積起來，不想白塔油恐慌竟然並無其事，此人白費了一番心血，白塔油全部壤掉。許多年後，他的鄰居們在壞了的白塔油堆中，找到了他的尸體。</p>
<p>美國最著名的守財奴，是一個女人，名呌海蒂葛林。海蒂年輕時，原是一個漂亮，聰敏的少女，人緣極好。不想自從她的姑母傳給她價値一百法美金的遺產以後，竟立刻變了樣子。她周旋于華爾街一些最心辣手狠的市儈中間，學得眼明手快，祗曉得自已撈錢，不管別人家死活，她發了大財，可是，一天到晚祗穿一件舊了的黑抱子，孤孤單單地住在一家　脚公寓裏，偶然出去吃飯，侍役從來別想得她一分錢小賬。她「苦」了一世，在一九一六年病死的時候，遺下的財產却在一億美元以上。</p>

<h3>火化與海葬</h3>
<p>— 未</p>
<p>際此叔世，大有生旣不易死亦難之慨。豪富之家，生前揮霍，死後風光，原無所謂。最不了者無產階級，生前爲生活掙扎，不邊寗息，若一且不幸而死，喪殮埋葬所需，縱破其產，猶感不足，而遺族之生活費用，尙不予焉，故就澈底節約言，火化與海葬，實有提倡之必要。</p>
<p>日前，老敎育家兼音樂家，前南洋公學附小校長沈叔達（心工）氏，於火化之後，舉行海葬；其哲嗣並遵遺命，於報端刊登吿別親友外，不發訃吿，且以所節省之喪葬費用，及親友吊儀，作爲音樂年獎基金，法良意美，足資矜式。節葬的亟應提倡，有三點理由：</p>
<p>第一，從經濟的立場說，前　謂：國家貧，則語之節用節葬。節用是生前之事，縮衣節食，擯却浮華，不浪費，不微逐者是。節葬爲身後之事，豐殮厚葬，僑道超應，槪應從免。一家節省千萬，十家便是萬萬，推而廣之，未始不能治國家的貧乏於萬一。</p>
<p>第二，就禮節言，厚葬原是後人炫富和迷信的勾當，旣背社會經濟原理，又與古　不合。墨子不贊成厚葬久喪，制爲埋葬之法曰：「棺三寸，足以朽骨，衣三領，足以朽肉，掘地之深，下無沮漏，氣無發洩於上，壟足以期其所，則止矣」。他甚至進一步表示，厚葬久喪，重爲棺槨，多爲衣衾，送死若徙，三年哭泣，扶後起，杖後行，耳無聞，月無見，此足以喪天下。</p>
<p>第三，以哲學的眼光來看，最澈底的莫過於晏平仲對管夾吾所說：「旣死，豈在我者，焚之亦可，沉之亦可，痙之亦可，露之亦可，衣薪而棄諸溝壑亦可，袞衣緒裳而納諸石槨亦可，唯所遇焉……」（列子楊朱篇）</p>
<p>所謂焚之亦可，沉之亦可，倒是火化與海葬的註解。滬上待葬積柩之多，爲世界各大都市之冠，數在十萬以上。美國「生活雜誌在記載吳市長所處理之上海市政工作一文中，曾挿入一張殯儀館中積柩高堆如山的照片，見之令人心怵。社會人士如能改變心理，提倡火化與海葬，亦解決許多不了問題之一個辦法也。</p>
<h3>感孝篇</h3>
<p>— 丁頁</p>
<p>孝經現在沒有人讀了，烈女傳大槪也沒有人看了，二十四孝的圖我們也好久沒有看見了。但最近坊間又刋印了一種二十四孝暨女子二十四孝的「圖傳彙編」小册子，比先前增加了一倍，計四十八孝。「父親節」的時候，據說銷了不少，家長們大概是買給孩子看的，希望孩子們學習這種中國「古有孝道」！</p>
<p>談到「孝」中國史上眞是史不絕書，皇帝則「以孝治天下」，做臣子的應該「事親孝然後事君忠」，自孔孟以後發揚孝道的君子們前仆後繼，所以中國賴此而不失道義之邦，現在的君子們特地印了四十八孝，這册子可稱集歷代孝子於一書的完備著作了。</p>
<p>這書的前半部二十四孝我知道是元朝的郭居業所著，後半部的女子二十四孝據編者先生說；是近人所編，這書的刋印目的據說爲了「冀於世道人心，有所裨益」。更希望「予以倡導，若人人能推其愛親之心，以愛家，愛國，愛人類，則進世界於大同，亦將以本書爲嚆矢矣！「編者先生的用心是够偉大了！</p>
<p>但是我的偏見對於二十四孝向來俄點惡感，不知怎樣給我看見了這册「進世界於大同以本書為嚆矢」的大著，更使我骨鯁在喉，非把不中聽的話一吐爲快了。如果這書是印給中年的一輩看，我以為他們自己已是做父親的人了，祇希望兒子來孝順他們，倘要他們照二十四孝去孝順六十歲以上的老人未必高興吧。假使是做給少年的一輩看的，我不敢願他們看這種書。因為這書裏的故事，若以現代的眼光來分析，其中有不少非但沒有裨益於少年，並且還包含着迷信的殘忍的無智的等等毒素在內。</p>
<p>例如：孟宗「哭竹生筍」，王祥「臥冰求鯉」，這是根本不合情理的奇蹟。什麽董永「賣身葬父」却會碰着仙女，不是近於鼓勵呌人出世嗎？還有郭巨夫婦的「爲母埋兒」，他們虐殺下一代而保存老朽者，這是什麼思想？難道呌今日的人再來玩這一套！大家學了老萊子「戲綵娛親」和庾黔婁的「嘗糞憂心」即可「進世界於大同」了。我眞佩服綱者先生的苦心！</p>
<p>其次如新編的女子二十四孝，其中大部份是承製前二十四孝的寓意，所不同的如所謂「一醮不改」，編者先生不知是何居心，要現代婦女再遵守「烈女不事二夫」的敎條？還有王蘭貞的「直言諫父」，她私自把她父親手批的西廂記紅樓夢燒掉，編者先生大槪認為是件「德事」，但是這二部作品自五四以來大家都承認是有價値的著作了，　胡適之後紅樓夢的考證不知發表了多少，還一度曾撰過課木，道些事編者先生不知知道沒有？如果沒有可去翻翻「中國小說史略」。最後有一篇「臂血和丸」還得說一說，這件事是從「割股療親」蛻變而來，然而這流毒至今還有，不必編者再來提倡。日前報載杭州通訊：「本市　　中學女生趙秀英，割股療親，當塲厥，……。」假使照編者看來一於世道人心，有所裨益」了。</p>

<p>物價又狂昇！憎恨木樨蒸；遍地起黑風，何處覓明燈？</p>
<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國小姐在家庭中</p>
<p>不明瞭美國家庭環境的人，對於美國女性一定有一稱錯誤的觀念，以謂美國女性除了跳舞看電影打字游泳外，對於家庭雜務是一概不管的，事實適得其反，要知多數美國家庭僱不起女傭，一切烹調洗滌灑掃耕植等事，都得自己動手，而且各人做谷人的事，母親向例不替女兒洗衣服，所以一個住在家庭裏的小姐，有着很多的事料理，即使她離開了父母，自行租賃公寓房子，也得負担一切雜務。早晨起來，走進廚房在電灶上煮咖啡烘麵包，吃過早點，整理房間或拖地板，掃地有電機，拖地板却並無機器，還得借重拖巴，做完工作，然後上公事房或學校。午膳大都在館子裏吃，也有帶飯盒及暖水壺在工作地點進膳，那種飯盒做得非常精巧，　一只梳粧匣子，有些是透明的，顯露出一只暖水壼，兩付三明治，提在手裏並不累贅或觸目。下班回家，燒一頓豐盛的晚膳，吃過晚飯，洗幾件零星衣裳，或做些女紅，在美國小姐的綉　裏很容易找到手搖縫衣機，那種縫衣機小得像玩具一樣，可以在那小小的縫衣機上可以縫出四季時裝，不過禮服及名貴的衣服，大都在新裝店內定製，縫工是相當昂貴，自己能做的，決不向新裝店去買。在美國利用洗衣機洗衣並不算一件大事，祗須把皂粉和衣服放在洗衣機內，把電門一開，三五分鐘，就洗好了。但是燙衣服須憑人工，那是比較麻煩的事，尤其在夏天，衣服又多，天氣又熱，這是家務中一件比較繁重的工作，一天工作做完，才可以出去參加宴會。星期天似乎是比較淸閑，但實際則更忙，早晨換了新裝到敎堂去做禮拜，這是每個小姐都該參加的，除非她沒有宗敎信仰；做禮拜回來，多數人把時間化在掃除房屋，拖地板，曬地氈，洗汽車，澆花種菜，如果屋後有菜圃的話，也有人在星期天油漆地板粉刷牆壁的，把一個粉粧玉琢的嬌軀，累得喘不過氣來，這種種工作在大中學裏專設有家庭經濟一門功課，所以美國小姐有百分之九十九懂得烹飪縫製·把家務處理得井井有條，倒是以婦道自鳴的中國小姐，在傭僕呵奉之中生長，漸漸把活動中心移到跳舞塲夜總會電影院去了，中國小姐已經失去了舊時代的賢德，還不曾受到新時代的生活技能，造成了社會上的許多交際花，少奶奶，花瓶，甚至姨太太，舞女，這也可以說是新代敎育的失敗，歐化過程中的一齣喜劇。</p>

<h3>憶鮑威爾</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>本年二月廿八日，密蘇里大學同學會在華盛頓開會時，鮑威爾曾作演說，闡明遠東的形勢。他說：「倘使美國和蘇發生戰事，這戰場一定在遠東而不在歐洲。目前的亞洲，共產主義，帝國主義，和美國的民主主義互相角逐着。中國印度數萬萬人民的傾向如何，全要看美國今後的動向。在遠東，西伯利亞，中國，和印度，是三處主要的政治地區，尤其是中國，他是亞洲的關鍵。我們要保持在遠東的地位，我們要用我們的智能和技巧，來扶助亞洲，來改造亞洲。」</p>
<p>鮑威爾的名字，在中國並不怎樣陌生的，他是現在密勒氏評論週報主持人小飽威爾的父親。鮑威爾是密蘇里人。曾在密蘇里大學攻新聞學，畢業後在漢納白爾從事新聞工作，旋返母校任講師，此後爲各報編輯，記者，漸漸地在新聞　　頭角了。一九一七年到上海，接辦密勒氏評論週報，以鋒利之筆，論述遠東及世界政局，很有許多精闢獨特的見解。</p>
<p>鮑威爾在中國二十多年，始終在注意遠東的局勢，向世界報導。當日本計劃侵略中國時，他首先揭露其野心，向世界發出警吿。九一八事變發生，證明了鮑威爾的議論是準確的。蘆溝橋事變之前一年，鮑威爾曾爲芝加哥論壇報寫了一篇小說，暗示日本在遠東備戰的情形。鮑威爾是位名記者，名作者，尤其對於遠東問題，更有深切的硏究。假使各國能早些信任鮑威爾的言論，日本也不會得如此猖獗。</p>
<p>鮑威爾處處暴露日本的野心和陰謀，當然爲日人所不滿，但也無可如何。迨日人揭露了他們猙獰的面目，公然向中國侵犯的時候，鮑威爾本該離開他危險的環境。可是他爲了人類的正義，毅然留居上海，繼續他的工作。上海淪爲孤島，敵僞的勢力，在租界一天一天地擴充起來，素視爲眼中釘的鮑威爾，當然要想迭子把他拔去。最初唆使漢奸要把他驅逐出境，鮑威爾置之不理。僞「特工」在四川路用手榴彈向他投擲，也幸而無恙。鮑威爾在敵人恐嚇威脅之下，總不能動搖他的正義感，他的言論格外犀利了。</p>
<p>珍珠港事變發生，敵人進入租界。鮑成爾逃不了敵人的魔掌，被監禁在集中營裏。他在百老匯大厦，過了七個月的牢獄生活。才由交換俘虜的船遣送返國。在那七個月中，鮑威爾的體重，减少了五分之二，他一條腿，也麻木得不能活動，終於在回國後將他鋸去了。勝利後，他還憑了他一條腿，到過東京，在遠東國際法庭上作證人。</p>
<p>當鮑威爾在密蘇里大學同學會上，演說完畢後，突患心臓病逝世，我們追念這一位中國的友人，為中國受了許多的痛苦，心中十分地不安。我們看到目前亞洲動盪的局面，更應該記起鮑威爾臨終的幾旬話。</p>

<h3>Opening of the Northeast War: Communist Bandits Launch "Sixth Offensive", Harassing Both North and Central Routes</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, 2nd] The Northeast Communist bandits' sixth offensive, initiated at the end of last month with provocations and attacks in Jinxi, resumed harassing along the Shanhaiguan-Changchun Railway in divided groups yesterday. It can be said that it has already begun, but the focus seems to remain in southern Liaoning. Changchun and Jilin are already on alert. Even if the Communist bandits take action, there will be no significant impact. Last night, there was fighting in Taojiatun on the central Changchun Railway, but the National Army marched south from Changchun along the Shanhaiguan-Changchun Railway on the morning of the 2nd for an offensive. The National Army in Gongzhuling also moved north to meet the attack, so the bandits in the Gongzhuling section can be cleared. Small groups of Communist bandits outside Qingyang have begun to roam. The National Army is encircling and suppressing them.</p>
<p>[Additional Dispatch] South of Changchun, which had been peaceful for three months, Communist bandits harassed in several routes starting from the 1st. The Shanhaiguan-Changchun Railway, which had just been repaired, was occupied by bandits at the Liufangzi Station for more than ten hours. Liufangzi North Taojiatun and its eastern Danantun, 60 miles from Changchun, all experienced battles. Yesterday, loud cannon fire was heard in Gongzhuling.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 2nd] The long-rumored sixth offensive of the Northeast Communist bandits has begun. In addition to the fierce fighting in western Liaoning and north of Gongzhuling, the bandits have concentrated their forces to target major strongholds outside Jiyang Pavilion. Faku, 75 kilometers north of Jibei, fell into the hands of the bandits, and the National Army is blocking them on the south bank of the Liao River. The First Column of the bandits, numbering about 10,000, first besieged Xifeng, then detoured to Weiyuan Fort, about 70 kilometers northeast of Kaiyuan Old City. The National Army is stepping up its resistance. The air force dispatched reconnaissance and bombing missions at noon on the 2nd, and the fighting was fierce. Wire communications in Changtu and Xifeng were interrupted on the 2nd, and the situation is unclear. Hundreds of bandit cavalry were discovered at Zhaojiatun, northwest of Xinmin on the western route, on the 2nd. Wire communications in Zhangwu are disrupted, and the situation is unclear. On the southern route, in order to disrupt traffic between Shenyang and Yingkou, the bandits destroyed several sections of the railway near the Fenshui Station north of Dashiqiao on the night of the 1st. Repairs were carried out on the 2nd, and train and telecommunications are still smooth. South of Xingcheng, between Xingcheng and Shanhaiguan, it was reported that stations such as Baimiaozi, Suizhong, Qianwei, and Qiansuo were occupied by the bandits, and railway bridges were severely damaged.

According to Sun Lianzhong, Hebei is currently strategizing support for the Northeast war.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 2nd] The Tianjin-Jianchang section of the Beining Railway was interrupted again on the 2nd. At 5:30 am, a freight train derailed between Chadian and Shexihe due to the railway tracks being sabotaged by bandits. A total of five protective vehicles and locomotives were involved. Repairs were completed by evening, and round trips to the four stations of Qiansuo, Wanjiatun, Gaoling, and Qianwei outside the Guan were suspended. The damage caused by the bandits was severe, and restoration is not expected in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Joint Consultation by Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, etc., on Civil Servant Compensation Issues, Advocates Issuance Based on 30 Yuan and Indexed</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 2nd] Liu Huidong, a member of the National Economic Council, recently submitted to the National Economic Council "Opinions on the Method of Uniform Compensation for Employees of National Enterprises." The main points are as follows: The total income of employees of state-owned enterprises shall not exceed 30% of the equivalent grade of public education personnel. The aforementioned compensation refers to salary, public funds, and all allowances. There shall be no other form of compensation. If the annual financial settlement shows a profit, a bonus may be issued with the approval of the competent authority, but it shall not exceed three months of income. Those with no profit will not receive a bonus. All personnel of state-owned enterprises are civil servants and shall comply with all laws and regulations regarding the service of civil servants. The office expenses of supervisors at all levels shall be clearly stipulated, and public funds shall not be used to pay for private expenses outside of the legally prescribed compensation. If the compensation for any special technical personnel and foreign personnel cannot be determined in accordance with this method, it shall be reported to the superior authority for approval by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Nanjing, 2nd] The issue of adjusting the compensation of public education personnel was discussed extensively on the morning of the 2nd by representatives from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Political Council, the Executive Yuan, and the Four Joint Offices. The meeting was convened by the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan, attended by Control Yuan members Wang Guanwu and Du Guangxun, Political Councilors Wu Xu and Fan Yuzhou, Legislative Yuan members Liu Zhiping, Liu Butong, and Cheng Yuanzhen, and representatives from the Executive Yuan and the Four Joint Offices, etc., chaired by Hua Butong. After the meeting began, the opinions raised by the Control Yuan, the Political Council, and individuals regarding the adjustment of the compensation of public education personnel were first reviewed, and each representative briefly explained them. Representatives from the Executive Yuan also explained the position of the Executive Yuan on adjusting compensation and the current difficulties, hoping to find a solution that is more reasonable and easier to implement. During the heated discussion that lasted two hours, a consensus was generally reached on the issue of compensation, that compensation should be adjusted based on a basic amount of 30 yuan and issued according to the cost of living index. The distribution of goods will continue and will be expanded to various places. For housing, the government will build new public education facilities on a large scale and requisition enemy and puppet houses to fairly and reasonably distribute them to the staff of various agencies. In addition, the education expenses of public education personnel's children will be borne by the public, and medical care will also be provided free of charge. The decisions made at today's meeting will be submitted to the next joint review meeting of the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan for discussion, so that they can be submitted to the next general meeting of the Legislative Yuan.

<h3>Suspicion Arises from Night Patrol by Militia, Gunshot Accidentally Hits Jinghu Train, Truth Revealed Behind the Shooting of the Kaixuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the incident in which the dining car No. F·D-12 of the Kaixuan train, which was travelling from Nanjing to Shanghai on the evening of September 3rd at approximately 8:00 pm, was shot at approximately three kilometers east of Qishuyan, the reporter has learned from relevant sources that the militia of the Fifth District of Wujin County was patrolling there that night and saw many farmers running towards them. The patrolling personnel of the team believed that they were suspicious and ordered them to stop, but the farmers suspected that the militia were bandits and turned and fled, which further increased the suspicion of the patrolling personnel, so they opened fire to suppress and stop them from fleeing. Unexpectedly, the Kaixuan express train travelling to Shanghai happened to be speeding past at that time, resulting in the dining car being hit by stray bullets. It is reported that the patrolling personnel of the militia who opened fire without cause have been punished by the competent authorities.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Usage Situation: Investigative Report by Four Supervisors - To Be Released Soon - Every Word Based on Evidence and Opinions Offered</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The investigative report on foreign exchange usage by the four supervisors was submitted to the President of the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 2nd by Wang Guanwu, He Hanwen, She Guangxun, Gu Fengxiang, and others. The full text is expected to be released soon. When submitting this important 17,000-word document, Wang and others told the President of the Executive Yuan that they had drafted the report with extreme caution, with every word based on evidence, and anything without the most solid proof was not included. It is reported that this report, drafted after about ten days of preparation, provides a comprehensive account of foreign exchange usage since March 4th of last year and includes a detailed review of previous policies. Furthermore, it mentions issues such as self-provided foreign exchange, foreign exchange wastage, and the Fu Zhong and Yangzi Company incidents. Notably, it includes an analysis of the distribution of foreign exchange to Chinese and foreign merchants, clarifying that the government has absolutely no discriminatory practices towards foreign businesses. In fact, foreign businesses often receive more foreign exchange per unit than domestic businesses. This clarification should dispel suspicions among some at home and abroad who are unaware of the truth and resolve unnecessary misunderstandings. The report also offers some suggestions, but the overall recommendations are not included. Regarding whether a proposal for impeachment will be put forward in the future, related parties declined to reveal anything.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Can Japan's Industrial Level Be Allowed to Rise Further?</h3>
<p>Mr. Sheba, the Chairman of the Fourth Committee on Japan and the US representative, recently reported on the current state of Japan's industrial production. He believes that the Far Eastern Commission's resolution that Japan's post-war economy should maintain the level it had between 1930 and 1934 is too strict and insufficient to supply Japan's peacetime needs, and seems to advocate for further increases. After seeing this news report, we wonder what the intentions of some American politicians and economists are. A few days ago, we received the September issue of "American Magazine," which contained an article by Mr. Stryker, an advisor on reparations issues for the US Army Department, entitled "Revenge is Waste," which fundamentally opposes the United Nations' demand for reparations from Japan and advocates overturning the resolution passed by the Far Eastern Commission, so as to allow Japan to retain a higher industrial level. This newspaper already wrote an article on the 29th of last month to refute it. However, Mr. Stryker's absurd arguments do represent the views of some American politicians and economists, and Mr. Sheba is one of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheba's report on the current state of Japanese industry can be summarized into the following four points: The level of Japanese industry determined by the Far Eastern Commission is inevitably too strict and insufficient to supply Japan's peacetime needs; Since its surrender, Japan has achieved very substantial recovery in industry, and this autumn's production volume has reached 45% of the level between 1930 and 1934; Concluding a peace treaty with Japan and restoring Japan's foreign trade is the only way to make Japan's economic recovery optimistic; It is expected that in the coming year, Japan will make even better progress in obtaining the essential industrial raw materials it needs. Judging only from Mr. Sheba's report, one can see the rapid speed of Japan's industrial recovery and the excessive leniency of the American attitude towards Japan. It not only poses a great threat to China, as General Shang Zhen, the head of our delegation, said: "When building the Japanese economy, precautions must be taken to prevent the recurrence of 'past unsatisfactory situations,' and the Allied nations should not forget the reconstruction work of China and the countries of the Western Pacific that were destroyed by Japan when assisting Japan in restoring its industry." Even the British representative felt uneasy after hearing Mr. Sheba's report, so Mr. also said: "Although the Japanese economy has not yet recovered to the extent that it threatens peace, it is necessary to conduct safety inspections of the development of the Japanese economy."</p>
<p>The issue of Japan's industrial level not only involves the core issue of the peace treaty with Japan—the issue of Japanese reparations—but also concerns China's security. In recent days, all sectors have been discussing the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, and all have emphasized the issue of Japan's post-war industrial level. President Truman's reparations commissioner, Mr. Pauley, personally went to Japan last year to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the country's industrial and commercial economy. After returning to the country, he submitted a report to the President, advocating that Japan's future industrial level should be based on the standard of 1928. However, after research by the US State Department, it was believed that Mr. Pauley's plan would reduce the living standards of the Japanese people, so it was revised to relax the standards and advocate for Japan's industrial level to be restored to the level of 1932. Later, the Far Eastern Commission held repeated meetings to discuss this issue and decided that Japan's future industrial level should be based on the standard between 1930 and 1934. But recently, some American politicians and economists believe that the level determined by the Far Eastern Commission is inevitably too strict and insufficient to supply Japan's peacetime needs. Mr. Stryker and Mr. Sheba are representatives of these people. What exactly are their intentions? It is really puzzling!</p>
<p>China's basic attitude towards Japan has been repeatedly expressed by our Foreign Affairs Bureau, adhering to an attitude of generosity and never adopting a policy of revenge towards Japan. However, generosity must have its limits. We know that if a policy of revenge is adopted towards a defeated country, the hatred between nations will deepen, which will inevitably arouse resentment among the people of the defeated country. The rise of Nazi Germany, which eventually led to World War II, is a good example. However, if we overcorrect and are unilaterally generous to a defeated country, even to the point of indulgence, allowing it to recover rapidly and maintain its potential for aggression, the consequences will be endless. As the saying goes, "Indulgence breeds evil." The Allied authorities must pay attention to this, especially since Japan is adopting the method of "Goujian serving Wu" in our history towards the United States, being outwardly obedient but inwardly determined to endure hardship and seek revenge at all times. Therefore, we have repeatedly called on the American government and the public to pay special attention to Japan and should be especially vigilant. In all fairness, Commissioner Pauley's plan to advocate for the standard of 1928 is the most fair. The Far Eastern Commission's decision is already inevitably too high. How can it be allowed to rise further? Mr. Hou Debang, General Manager of Tianjin Yongli Chemical Industry Company, spent two months in Japan this summer and witnessed the rapid recovery of Japan. Filled with emotion, he recently gave a speech to the press, saying: "With the support of the US military, Japanese industry has gradually recovered to its pre-war level. The Pauley Plan has been abandoned, and Mr. Stryker's generous anti-reparations theory has given Japan even greater encouragement."</p>
<p>In short, what are the intentions of Mr. Stryker and Mr. Sheba? It is certainly not to deal with China, but it has other effects, but the consequences it creates are enough to threaten China's security. Therefore, we must criticize such absurdities that could endanger peace in the Far East!</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of Engineers</h3>
<p>Director Zhang's Speech</p>
<p>Director Zhang said in his speech: The annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers was previously held in Rong and Yu during the war and made considerable achievements in the construction of Sichuan Province, giving Sichuan Province a foundation for construction. During the War of Resistance, it was stated in the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction that the War of Resistance was to eliminate obstacles to construction, and the importance of construction can be seen. After the general mobilization order was issued this year, I had a speech explaining that the current struggle is between the forces of destruction and construction. Although our country has abolished the unequal treaties of the past century, if we want to achieve true independence and freedom, we must strive for it through construction. We should all concentrate our efforts on construction in order to obtain the true meaning of independence and freedom. Mr. Zhang then reported on his impressions of his recent inspection in Northeast China and North China, and emphasized the importance of "talent populating the border regions," saying: During this trip to the recovered areas, I visited all the factories worth seeing, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant, to investigate. According to the investigation, when the Japanese operated the mines before the end of the War of Resistance, coal production was estimated at 27 million tons in the Northeast and 14 million tons in North China, totaling more than 40 million tons. This year's production is 25 million tons. It is hoped that it can be restored to 30 million tons. Secondly, iron ore production is 2 million tons in the Northeast and 680,000 tons in North China, steel production is 1.8 million tons in the Northeast and 130,000 tons in North China, and electricity production is 1.8 million kilowatts in the Northeast and 150,000 kilowatts in North China. These are all major resources for industrial construction. Our engineers have great foresight and the hard work of the engineering personnel is extremely admirable. In particular, the heroic spirit of engineers Zhang Xinfu, Yu Zailin, and the recent deaths of 83 engineers in the recent battle are all extremely admirable. Today, we should strengthen the defense of Northeast China and North China. At the same time, I propose the idea of "talent populating the border regions," which is urgently needed at present. Because if we want to talk about construction, the first is construction, and the second is talent. China's resources include coal in the Northeast and oil in the West and North. Even looking at the entire Southeast Asia, its quality and quantity of coal cannot exceed our Datong Coal Mine. Datong's coal is as good as the coal in English Welsh. We need to strengthen protection and also need people to manage it. We hope that engineers can study how to strengthen management, and we hope that everyone can go to the border areas for inspection in order to develop resources. On the day of the annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, I would like to offer the four characters "talent populating the border regions" to everyone.</p>
<p>Mr. Bai Chongxi's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Bai Chongxi briefly discussed the relationship between engineering and national defense. He said: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, engineering construction greatly helped national defense. For example, the completion of the Xiang-Gui Railway greatly assisted in the important task of advancing the war. Later, the Gui-Qian Railway and the Shan-Gan Railway were all important strategic projects. In terms of resources, the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu and the alcohol factories established everywhere were the assistance of our engineering community to the development of such resources, so that the five million troops could fight a long-term war in the inconvenient areas of the southwest. Secondly, Minister Bai analyzed international wars, saying: The First World War was still a positional war, while the Second World War was a victory for scientific warfare, because scientific inventions such as radar, rocket launchers, and atomic bombs were able to end the war. Now, the Ministry of National Defense has a National Defense Science Committee for this purpose, hoping to establish close contact with the engineering community, while researching and improving. Therefore, our engineering construction plan should be coordinated with the construction of national defense science.</p>
<p>Mr. Weng Wenhao's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Weng Wenhao briefly stated: We claim to build the country on agriculture, but we are short of 30 million dan of grain every year. We want to be scientific, but during the War of Resistance, we could still manufacture 1,500-kilowatt generators, but after the victory, we could no longer manufacture them. The reason is that everyone thought that they should be comfortable after the victory and did not work hard. Therefore, I believe that engineers should have three standards: Construction, Advancement, and Meaningful planned work. We must defeat those who hinder national construction and build the country. We must fully do meaningful and planned work.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Lifu's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Lifu replied: If the government has a more complete plan, then engineers will make a greater contribution. For example, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, engineers participated in the construction of military positions, and their bravery was no less than that of armed soldiers. But what we hope for is a more concrete plan. Engineers are not afraid of death. In the future, military affairs and engineering will be inseparable. We must give engineers the opportunity to work and die for the country. Secondly, Mr. Chen believes that the current economic policy and financial policy cannot be coordinated, and the financial policy is running counter to the goal of increasing industrial production. Therefore, we also hope that those responsible for the economy must study how to develop industry under very reasonable conditions. Finally, he hopes that the education sector can especially seek more equipment for engineering education.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Chairman</p>
<p>Respectful telegram to the Chairman: To Chairman Chiang: Your brilliant decision-making and leadership in the War of Resistance eventually led to victory, which is respected by the world. As you are about to devote yourself to peace, implement constitutional government, and return power to the people, it is the opening of the 14th annual meeting of this association, bringing together engineers from all over the country. All of us will fulfill our duties to the best of our ability, and strive to cooperate with national defense and people's livelihood, in order to live up to your intention of peace and national construction. We respectfully send this telegram and ask for your consideration. The Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Joint Annual Meeting of Various Specialized Engineering Societies kowtow.</p>

<p>The opening of the annual meeting of engineers, the upper right corner is Director Zhang's speech. (Central News Agency Photo)</p>
<p>Wang Ni Mo's Retrial (Continued from Page 1) Wang Ni's answer stated that his involvement was initially motivated by the need to support a family of nine, so he took the position of professor at the puppet Normal College. Later, Tang Erhe (then Educational Supervisor) and Japanese Major Narita (Japanese Special Agency Education Director) persuaded and coerced him into reluctantly taking the position of president of the Normal College. It was not until the end of 1943 that he began serving as a political commissioner and educational supervisor. The process was due to the promotion of colleagues in the Beijing cultural and educational circles. Initially, Chang Zhun, Zhang Dongsun, Tang Erhe, and others met at Tang Zhiming's residence. Before taking office, he asked Zhang and others how to preserve the vitality of education in North China. He claimed that his acceptance of the puppet position was purely due to Zhang and others' persuasion. He presented Zhang Dongsun's letter of proof in court, stating that he had consulted Wang, but Zhang had "not replied due to a bad mood." Zhang's letter proved that Wang was trying to preserve culture and education. Wang Ni also expressed with emotion that he was subjected to enemy bullying, "which is difficult to describe in one word." The court then asked why he did it again after suffering losses. As a university professor, he should understand reason, but he did not know that under Japanese control, it was impossible to have the freedom to do things as he pleased and preserve Chinese culture. His understanding was not clear, which was too difficult to explain. Wang Ni repeatedly said yes. Finally, he was asked about the Qinghua University's accumulated books and materials being sold as waste paper by the Education Directorate. Wang Ni claimed that he was negligent beforehand and had tried his best to remedy it afterward. The sold items were old files from the Beijing government, with no books at all. The interrogation ended at 4:30 PM.

<h3>If the Democratic League Does Not Change Its Style, the Government Will Take Action</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Sources say that the government spokesman's accusations against the Democratic League are all based on facts. Therefore, if the Democratic League does not change its style, the government will take action in the near future. The Democratic League has assisted the Communist bandits in intelligence work.

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 2nd] Liu Zuoren, the governor of Guangdong Provincial Bank, recently returned from an inspection of various places in Nanyang. According to him, although overseas Chinese in Nanyang suffered greatly from enemy devastation during the war, their recovery after the war has been extremely rapid. However, the main local products such as rubber and tin have not fully resumed production, and the unrest in the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam has prevented them from recovering to their pre-war prosperity for the time being. Singapore has not been turned into a war zone, and its economic situation can still maintain its old appearance, but its currency value is also extremely low. Overseas Chinese in Singapore and other places have a deep hope for the motherland, and remittances are rapidly increasing. They all hope that the motherland will be stable soon so that they can return home to invest and start industries. Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies suffered greatly from the maltreatment of the local people during the recent war, with more than 100,000 victims, and they are looking forward to the motherland's rescue day and night.</p>

<h3>Requisitioning Enemy and Puppet Properties in Nanjing and Shanghai: Allocating Them as Dormitories for Public School and Government Personnel; Representatives from Various Organizations Discussing the Compensation of Public School and Government Personnel</h3>
<p>(Continued from the first page) During today's meeting, Liu Zhiping, Wu [name missing in original] Xu, Chen Zifeng and others spoke separately. There were different views on the level of the basic salary. Some people thought 15 [currency unit missing in original] was sufficient, while others thought 30 [currency unit missing in original] was too little.</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee member Wang Guanwu spoke, emphasizing that superiors and subordinates should share hardships together and that there should be no more disparities and injustices. He stated sorrowfully that at present, some officials and important figures have their food, lodging, and servants provided by the government. The enjoyment of one person is at least equivalent to that of many civil servants. Often, a minister occupies ten rooms, while junior staff cannot even find one room. This kind of disregard for subordinates and unequal phenomenon should be corrected. Regarding the entire compensation issue, he believes that in addition to salary increases, the government should do its best to provide in-kind allocations, accommodation, subsidies for [items missing in original] and education expenses. The aim should not be [missing in original], but rather universality, so that everyone can benefit. Regarding accommodation, he also put forward a strong suggestion, advocating the requisition of enemy and puppet properties and the equal distribution to civil servants of various organizations. Wang recently returned from investigating enemy and puppet properties and stated that in Shanghai alone, there are over 3,300 enemy and puppet properties, all occupied by influential figures, which should be requisitioned.</p>
<p>Liu [name missing in original] does not believe that the national treasury has no funds to build dormitories for public school and government personnel. He cited a shocking fact: a certain important figure recently celebrated his birthday, and the Four Banks and Two Bureaus were ordered to give gifts of 60 million [currency unit missing in original] each. Six times six is thirty-six, and with a wave of the hand, 360 million [currency unit missing in original] was obtained. Money is available for private gifts, but not for building dormitories for public school and government personnel. This statement should convince everyone.</p>
<p>Cheng Yuan [name missing in original] advocated starting with salary increases. He believes that even if everyone's salary is doubled, the national treasury has ample capacity to bear it. The current national financial difficulties are mainly due to corruption in the tax system, with tax revenues being pocketed by those who handle them. If the government can resolutely rectify tax collection, then the increased income can be used to adjust the compensation of civil servants and will definitely not lead to financial collapse. The original proposer, Liu Zhiping, put forward the following points: 1. Support the method proposed by the Supervisory Yuan of using 30 [currency unit missing in original] as the base salary and issuing it according to the cost of living index. 2. The adjustment of compensation should not be limited to Nanjing and Shanghai but should be extended to the whole country. 3. Building loans that have not been issued should be recovered, and the use of those that have been issued should be thoroughly investigated.</p>
<p>After the attendees finished speaking, they discussed each item individually. Regarding the salary adjustment method, everyone agreed to adopt the method proposed by the Supervisory Yuan of using 30 [currency unit missing in original] as the base salary. This 30 [currency unit missing in original] is calculated according to the cost of living index. For amounts above 30 [currency unit missing in original], the method proposed by Chen Lifu will be used, which is approximately 5,000 times the current standard.</p>
<p>Regarding the in-kind allocation method, most people agreed that it should be continued and expanded to the whole country. As for the types of items, they should still be rice, oil, salt, sugar, coal, and cloth, among other seven types. Cheng Yuan [name missing in original] raised the issue of imperfections in the past in-kind allocation methods, such as insufficient distribution of oil and coal briquettes, and some bureaucratic capitalists taking the opportunity to make a fortune. Therefore, he advocated only providing rice, coal, and cloth.</p>
<p>Regarding the dormitory issue, the attendees generally agreed that the government should build more dormitories for public school and government personnel. The suggestion made by Wang Guanwu to requisition enemy and puppet properties in Nanjing and Shanghai and distribute them equally to civil servants of various organizations was passed without objection. Chen Zifeng and others advocated recovering building loans to build houses and punishing those with money and houses who borrow again with the crime of corruption. Liu [name missing in original] also agreed, while She Guangxun believed that those who borrowed legally in the past should not be held accountable, and future loans should be stopped.</p>
<p>Regarding children's education and medical expenses, the attendees generally agreed that they should be provided free of charge. Du Guangxun also cited the fact that the cost of his children's illness consumed several months of his salary. Another attendee also pointed out that tuition fees for children entering school accounted for the entirety of one month's income. Everyone agreed that the government should establish more schools and hospitals.</p>

<h3>The Security Council Mediates International Disputes: Major Powers Should Abandon the Right of Veto; China Makes a Formal Proposal to the General Assembly; Jiang Tingfu Declares Support for the U.S. Position on the Greek Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, Second Day [of Month Missing]]: China today formally proposed to the United Nations General Assembly that the five permanent members of the Security Council should automatically abandon their right of veto when mediating international disputes. However, it does not advocate amending the UN Charter but only requests to clarify the nature of the automatic abandonment of the veto. Diplomatic circles are surprised by this move, given that the Chinese government recently issued a statement advocating for the retention of the veto.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, First Day [of Month Missing]]: Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu this morning explained China's attitude towards the Greek issue at the Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly. Jiang stated that the Chinese delegation supports the proposal made by the United States regarding the Balkan issue. Although China is far from Greece and has no direct material relationship in Southeast Europe, we are still concerned about the situation in Greece because the various principles involved in the Greek issue are extremely important to world peace and security. According to the U.S. proposal, the General Assembly should declare that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia are guilty of aggression against Greece and send a United Nations commission to the Balkans to restore peace to the Greek border. Jiang also stated that some theories argue that the Greek issue stems from British and American aid to Greece. However, neither the UN Charter nor international law prohibits a government from aiding another government or accepting aid from another government. Therefore, other governments have no legal reason to be dissatisfied with Greece's acceptance of British and American aid. We cannot accept the view expressed in some theories that because the United States and Britain aided Greece, Greece's neighboring countries can use force to assist the opposition factions in Greece. If we recognize this theory, it will lead to anarchy. This General Assembly should declare to the world that we abide by the universally recognized principles of international law, and one of the most important aspects is that no country can assist or instigate rebellion within other countries.</p>

During the election, Indian representative Pandit declared, "India's representative must compete for this position because this involves a fundamental principle." Upon hearing this, Soviet representative Vyshinsky became extremely angry and went to the podium to refute it. He was stopped by Chairman Aranha, who pointed out that this discussion was useless to the General Assembly and asked permission for the General Assembly to continue its work. Vyshinsky refused to listen and continued his defense, blaming the chairman for using the gavel during his speech. He then angrily returned to his seat. The entire venue was silent and everyone was surprised.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, First Day [of Month Missing]]: The General Assembly held four rounds of voting to elect the increased number of members of the Trusteeship Council. After the first round of voting, the four candidate countries, the Philippines, Norway, Costa Rica, and [name missing in original], obtained the closest number of votes.

<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, First Day [of Month Missing]]: U.S. Representative Austin accused Bulgaria in the Security Council today that its actions against Greece constitute a threat to peace.

Wallace said that the original intention of the Marshall Plan was to alleviate the post-war chaos and shortages in Europe, but it has been destroyed by "selfish people" who intend to use the plan as a political weapon. "We have witnessed Hoover's proposal to rebuild Germany as a fortress of private monopolies become the center of American policy." He again attacked the State Department's policies and said that if American voters could "send the gentlemen of Wall Street back to their banks and drive the soldiers back to their divisions," it would greatly benefit international peace and coordination.

<h3>Asian Countries' Cold Attitude Greatly Affects Sales of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Japanese Trade Vice-Minister Arai discussed the situation one month after the resumption of private trade, stating: Since trade officially began on September 1st, only 73 transactions, totaling a mere 1.25 million US dollars, have been completed by September 25th. These transactions involve wartime or pre-war stockpiles such as furs, canned goods, and artificial pearls, and no transactions for new products have been completed. The reason is that traders from Japan's major pre-war trading partners (Asian countries) have not yet come to Japan, while the traders currently in Japan, mainly from the United States, consider: 1. prices are too expensive; 2. production technology is inferior; 3. styles are outdated; 4. Japanese merchants lack business ethics; 5. the quantity of goods is small. Furthermore, many American merchants are aiming to establish branches and invest in Japan.</p>

<h3>Authorities Agree on Countermeasures for the Streetcar Workers' Strike: All Must Return to Work Today, Otherwise Unconditional Dismissal; Replacement Workers Are Ready and Can be Deployed Immediately</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal authorities convened an important meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau conference room at 4 p.m. yesterday to handle the French streetcar workers' strike. Those in attendance included Mayor Wu, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, Workers' Welfare Committee Director Lu Jingshi, Police Bureau Director Yu Shuping, General Labor Union Chairman Shui Xiangyun, and Social Affairs Bureau Labor Division Director Shen Ding. The French director and personnel manager of the French water and electricity company also attended. The meeting ended at 5:45 p.m. After the meeting, Mayor Wu and Director Wu met with reporters. Mayor Wu said: The French streetcar workers' strike has been dragging on for several days. Most well-intentioned workers have been unable to return to work due to external threats. Considering the public interest, the authorities cannot allow public transportation to remain suspended for so long. Therefore, workers have been notified that if they do not return to work, they will be unconditionally dismissed. The government has made all preparations, and public buses can be driven by soldiers from the driving corps, and streetcars can be operated by unemployed workers. However, the workers are still delaying their return to work. Therefore, the company issued a notice tonight (referring to last night) requiring all workers to return to work by the 3rd, otherwise they will be unconditionally dismissed. From the 4th, the Social Affairs Bureau will immediately deploy the workers who are ready and begin hiring new workers. The government is taking this measure not because it is being too harsh on the workers, but because they have been warned repeatedly and still refuse to return to work. The situation cannot be delayed any longer, and for the sake of the public interest, this is the only way. Mayor Wu continued that the list of personnel to be arrested has already been announced. This list was found at the Futong Printing Company. Those who are at large have been instructed to have each Baojia try to collect drawings of photographic images and to arrest them. Workers who are not on the announced list should not believe rumors. Any well-intentioned worker who is threatened by trouble-makers can report to the police station, and the municipal government has ordered all police stations to provide protection. Currently, trouble-makers are using a "bitter meat" strategy, using the families of arrested workers to cry and wail at the factory to prevent workers from going to work. If these family members have grievances, they can go to the Social Affairs Bureau or the municipal government to appeal and explain. In the future, any similar crying and obstruction will be regarded as disruptive behavior and will be subject to arrest. The government will resolutely protect well-intentioned workers, but workers who are not on the arrest list but collude with those on the arrest list will also be severely punished. Mayor Wu finally hoped that the well-intentioned workers of the French streetcar company would not be afraid of threats and return to work today, and stated that any threats from trouble-makers in Shanghai can be suppressed.</p>
<p>Mounted Police to Protect Returning Workers</p>
<p>Director Wu continued to supplement the report, saying that the government has made the greatest determination and dispatched all mounted patrols, police, and plainclothes police to protect returning workers and their families, so that they can work with peace of mind. Any returning worker or their family who is threatened can report to the police station at any time, and the authorities will severely punish the threatening personnel. Director Wu also stated that if French streetcar workers return to work after today's deadline, they will be hired as new workers, and all past years of service will not be counted.</p>
<p>Director Wu also told reporters that Zhu Junxin and 15 others who were previously dismissed by the Social Affairs Bureau from the French streetcar company are all on the wanted list.</p>
<h3>Workers Hold General Meeting, Majority Willing to Return to Work, Abandoned After Dispersing From the Factory Due to Underhanded Tactics, Leaflet Distributors Arrested</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] French streetcars and buses did not leave the factory yesterday morning, but partially resumed work in the afternoon, with more than 20 vehicles running. Employees had sent representatives to see Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu the night before, saying that they could formally return to work yesterday, but hoped that the drivers sent out by the Social Affairs Bureau would no longer work, otherwise they feared that workers would misunderstand that their jobs were being taken and be unable to return to work. Director Wu said that if the employees could return to work, the drivers sent out could wait a while, and to avoid stimulating the original workers, he immediately ordered the drivers sent out not to enter the car factory, but to wait elsewhere. At 10 a.m. yesterday, employees held a general meeting in the factory, attended by more than 400 people. Some employees still demanded the release of the arrested workers. However, under persuasion, the majority of the workers present said they would be willing to return to work and agreed to return to work in the afternoon after returning home to put on their work clothes. The factory immediately dispatched a fixed-route trolleybus, a streetcar, and a bus at 10:30 a.m. to transport the returning workers. After the meeting, as the workers left the factory, a track worker numbered 45 distributed "Letter to the People of Shanghai" from the "Strike Committee of the French Streetcar Company of the Shanghai Electric Power Company" and "Letter to Members" from the French Electric Power Union near the post office on Jianguo East Road, south of the car factory. Military police nearby discovered this and arrested him. As a result, the workers who were scheduled to return to work at the factory in the afternoon abandoned their plans. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau still dispatched the workers who were prepared in the afternoon to drive out of the factory to maintain transportation. Each vehicle had two armed policemen accompanying it for protection, and the fare, regardless of distance, was still 1,000 yuan across the board.</p>
<h3>Company Issues Notice Sent Out Late at Night</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The French streetcar company issued a notice last night, requiring workers to return to work by the 3rd, saying that otherwise they would be dismissed and other personnel would be hired to replace them. All dismissed personnel will be treated as voluntarily resigning, and all dismissal, retirement, and other preferential measures will be cancelled. After the above notice was mimeographed, the Social Affairs Bureau sent people to deliver it to each employee's home late at night.</p>
<h3>Power Plant Returns to Normal, Over 1,000 Workers Report to the Factory</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The American Electric Power Company's Yangshupu Power Plant completely returned to normal yesterday. According to the person in charge of the factory's union reorganization committee, a total of 1,110 workers reported to the factory throughout the day. Except for two people who reported sick leave, all others arrived at the factory on time to work on the generator. Electricity generation has also increased. The power outage in some areas of Nanshi and the former French Concession the night before was due to a sudden decrease in the power plant's electricity generation, and the company automatically shut down the current to the aforementioned areas. Rumors that the power lines were destroyed were inaccurate. It has also been learned that a power supply shed at the intersection of Pengpu Road and Yulin Road was destroyed yesterday, but was quickly repaired. The Yulin Road Police Station and the Garrison Headquarters have dispatched additional police officers to protect it and strictly investigate traitors who attempt to destroy electricity.</p>
<h3>Meteorological Observatory Sends Letter of Explanation to the City Council, Stating That Weather Forecasts Are Not Inaccurate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, in response to comments made at the City Council meeting that the observatory's reports were inaccurate and recommending that the central government improve them, sent a special letter of explanation to the City Council yesterday, stating: The personnel at our observatory who make weather forecasts is Senior Technician Long Xiangqi. He has been the director of the Xujiahui Meteorological Observatory for 27 years and has very rich experience in weather forecasting. Regarding the example cited by Councilor Shi Zongde, on June 9th, there was a strong wind, and our observatory issued storm warning signals at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on the 8th. After investigation, it was found that the "Shu Can" was unfortunately sunk on that day, but there was no incident of more than 100 boats being lost outside Wusongkou. Furthermore, the news that a typhoon would come to Shanghai on August 29th and 30th was merely a headline created by a reporter to arouse readers' interest. In fact, the content of the reports did not mention any news of landfall in Shanghai. These are all verifiable facts and cannot be fabricated, it said.</p>
<h3>Two Money Shops Suspected of Dealing in Gold and Currency</h3>

<h3>Crackdown on Black Market for Gold and Currency, Two Awards Issued</h3>

<h3>Inspector from the Ministry of Interior Arrives in Shanghai, Will Visit the City Council Today</h3>

<h3>Newly Revised Commercial Registration Law, Very Detailed Provisions, Opinions from Xi Yushu, Chen Tingrui, etc.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the key points of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' newly revised draft Commercial Registration Law were published in the newspapers, a reporter specially consulted with accountant Xi Yushu, who gave his opinion, stating: The method adopts a definitional provision for the scope of commerce, instead of an enumeration, which can avoid the problem of leaving out one or two cases. The method requires that registrations other than creation or change should be registered at the same time as creation or change. With such regulations, the nature of the store is easy for the competent authority to investigate, and the public can easily understand. For example, there are more than ten stores in this city that use the Guan Sheng Yuan name, but as far as I know, most of them are agencies, and the outside world is not very clear. Taking this example alone, it can be seen that the registration of managers, agents, partners, etc. is really necessary. Lawyer Chen Tingrui also expressed his opinion, saying that the new law is very detailed in its regulations on various registrations. He also said that China is carrying out large-scale post-war construction, and in principle, it should value foreign technology and capital. However, the psychology of some Chinese people at present is still worried about foreign economic invasion, which is not necessary. After the abolition of consular jurisdiction, if there can be strict commercial management, the tricks of the past will definitely not be seen again today. Passively opposing international economic cooperation is really not a wise move.</p>

Later, according to Bian's observations, Chen and Bian's wife seemed to be having an affair. Bian was furious and separately took a concubine.

<h3>Qingdao Tries Traitor and Corruption Cases: Diao Fuchi Highly Suspected; Ding Jingchen Bribed 800 Million to Buy Freedom, Falls Back into Confinement</h3>
<p>[Qingdao, 28th (Airmail)] Qingdao recently uncovered a case of corruption and malfeasance involving Diao Fuchi, a prosecutor at the Second Branch of the Shandong High Court, and others, involving 800 million yuan. Diao was suspended from his duties and released on bail for investigation on the 8th of this month. It is now reported that he has flown to Jinan to await questioning. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Ding Jingchen, an economic traitor, was the chairman of the Dabu Bank during the Japanese occupation of Qingdao. The bank was a joint venture between the puppet government and merchants. After the victory, Ding was reported, and the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Branch of the High Court (with Zhu Weiran as the Chief Prosecutor) treated Ding with great deference during the investigation of the case. Each interrogation was conducted by Diao himself at the detention center, without a court hearing. There was early speculation that this was not right. The case dragged on until October of last year, when the Prosecutor's Office concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a crime and decided not to prosecute him, causing a public outcry. Local newspapers reported the case extensively, questioning, "If Ding Jingchen is not a traitor, then who is?"  The Second Branch of the High Court even sent a letter to a newspaper, correcting them, stating that the case was handled entirely according to the law and that evidence should be presented if Ding was considered a traitor, which further fueled dissatisfaction. The City Council then sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for clarification. The Ministry confirmed that Dabu Bank was a traitor bank and Ding Jingchen was an economic traitor.</p>
<p>Someone in Jinan also reported Ding Jingchen to the High Court, and the Shandong Provincial Council sent a letter to the High Court requesting the Second Branch of the High Court to thoroughly investigate. The High Court then sent a letter to the Second Branch of the High Court on October 18th stating: "Our Court has accepted a case involving Ding Jingchen and others as traitors. It has been reported that the defendant Ding Jingchen was arrested in Qingdao and that your office has concluded the investigation, deciding not to prosecute him due to insufficient evidence of a crime. We hereby inform you that you should send the entire case file to our court for handling. If the defendant has not been released on bail, please detain him temporarily. If he has been released on bail, please add a significant amount of bail to ensure caution." Unexpectedly, Ding Jingchen left Qingdao on the day the Second Branch of the High Court announced the decision not to prosecute him, flying to Shanghai by plane, his actions swift and surprising. It was later discovered that Ding lived at No. 123 Linsen Middle Road in Shanghai and frequently visited Dr. Yu Caiyao's clinic at No. 94 Zhongzheng North First Road. The Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office was telegraphed to bring Ding to justice. On October 26th, the Shanghai office detained Ding and transferred him to Qingdao via Jinan.</p>
<p>During the investigation in Jinan, it was reported that Ding had fully disclosed all the bribery details, stating that the money had been used in all departments of the Second Branch of the High Court in Qingdao, totaling 800 million yuan (at last year's currency value). Ding originally expected to buy his way out of prison, but now that he has still lost his freedom, he feels unwilling. Although the Prosecutor's Office is currently conducting a "secret" investigation, rumors about the case have already spread widely in Qingdao and Jinan.</p>
<p>In June of this year, Hu Ji, the President of the Jinan High Court, reportedly came to Qingdao for this case. On the 8th of this month, the presiding prosecutor, Diao Fuchi, was suspended from his duties and released on bail for investigation. According to the Second Branch of the High Court, Diao has already flown to Jinan. The inside story of this case is complex and involves a wide range of people.

<h3>South Seas Rubber Prices Fall: Overseas Chinese from Hainan Return Home</h3>
<p>[Hainan Island, 28th (Airmail)] In recent months, more overseas Chinese have been returning to the island than leaving, especially from the Malay Peninsula. According to officials from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, the reasons are generally due to: 1. Falling rubber prices. Previously, the price of rubber was about $35 per picul, and it even rose to $38 at one point. Due to the brisk sales of rubber, most Chinese workers had jobs and their lives were relatively stable. However, the market price has recently been only about $25 per picul. Rubber factories are finding it difficult to continue due to the low price of goods. Even if they do not go bankrupt, they are laying off large numbers of employees due to cost issues, which is a major reason forcing overseas Chinese to return home. 2. Food problems.  Most of the food for overseas Chinese in Malaya is supplied by the black market. Due to rising black market rice prices, it is difficult for ordinary overseas Chinese to purchase rice, and they are returning home to seek other ways to make a living. Regarding remittance issues, due to the above two reasons, it is also reported that remittances have sharply decreased, which is a serious crisis for overseas Chinese in Malaya. However, according to reporters' inquiries from various sources: although the number of overseas Chinese going to Singapore has decreased, there is an abnormal phenomenon, that is, very few middle-aged and elderly men are going to Singapore, while there are more elderly, weak, women and children, because the entry permits issued by the British government are very strict. As for those going to Burma, after the Burmese representative U Tun Maung arrived in Hainan to handle the repatriation of Hainanese overseas Chinese from Burma, very few new people are going abroad.</p>
<h3>Suzhou High Court Detention Center: Warden Tang Ying Takes Office; Zhang Guohui and Others Suddenly Dismissed; Telegram Sent to Council Requesting Justice</h3>

Today, he dismissed the detention center director Zhang Guohui and sixteen others without cause. Zhang and others requested payment of their August and September salaries and an explanation for their dismissal, but to no avail. Today, they jointly telegraphed the Suzhou Provincial Council and the High Prosecutor's Office, requesting justice.</p>
<h3>Suicide Rampant in Guangzhou: 32 Cases Last Month; 237 Corpses Found on the Streets</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou, 2nd (Telegram)] According to statistics from the Guangzhou Municipal Health Bureau, a total of 237 corpses were found on the streets in September, averaging eight per day, mostly people who had starved to death. Furthermore, there has been a recent surge in suicides here, reaching 32 cases in September, breaking this year's record, mostly due to poverty and illness.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Implements On-Site Management of Prostitutes</h3>
<p>[Fuzhou, 1st (News)] Fuzhou prostitutes and entertainers have long lacked proper management, posing a significant obstacle to social order and national health. The municipal government will formulate detailed rules based on Shanghai's management methods for prostitutes and issue them to the municipal police bureau for implementation. Regulations will be made regarding physical examinations, business areas, and other aspects of prostitution.</p>
<h3>Twelve-Month Pregnancy: A Strange Girl Born</h3>
<p>[Hainan Island, 24th (Airmail)] The wife of Liao Fuxing, a villager of Dapo Village in Chengmai County, Hainan Island, gave birth to two children on September 12th, a boy and a girl. The boy was normal, but the girl had fully formed upper and lower teeth in her mouth, with longer front teeth. Her head and face were silvery-white, resembling a grown woman, which was quite eerie. The villagers, upon hearing the news, rushed to see her. The next day, the mother, believing that giving birth to such a daughter was an ominous sign, secretly smothered the girl to death. It is reported that the woman was pregnant for almost twelve months before giving birth.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand People Compete to Watch the Haining Tide: The Grandeur on the Eve of the Tide God's Birthday is Undiminished</h3>
<p>[Haining, 1st (News)] Today is the eve of the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, the "Tide God's Birthday." Reporters and group personnel from various districts and counties went to Babao from Chang'an to watch the tide. The once quiet city of Haining appeared very lively. Pedestrians milled about, and farmers from all over the area gathered. At noon, when the tide came, the Babao Dam was bustling. China Travel Service and the Highway Administration both built viewing platforms, and although the temporary shops were quite simple, their business was a hundred times more prosperous. The crowds were as large as in previous years, but the tide was not as magnificent as it once was. After the tide passed, cars sped along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, and pedestrians were as thick as thread, with the "human tide" being more ferocious than the "sea tide." Potalaka devotees have also gathered here and will be "staying overnight" for three days. It is expected that the grand occasion will be even more pronounced tomorrow, which is the "Tide God's Birthday."</p>
<p>[Haining, 1st (News)] The reporter has been fortunate enough to witness the roaring tide on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month on several occasions, which can be considered a highlight of his life. Fearing that he may not be able to see the tide again next year, and to commemorate the magnificent scenes of the past, he would like to borrow a corner of the page to describe the various grand occasions of the Tide God's Birthday.</p>
<p>A telegram from Hangzhou reports that the highest tide will occur on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, and the grandeur of watching the tide will exceed next year, because the river's course has changed, and the tidal bore in Haining has become smaller. It is predicted that there will be almost no tide to see next year. In fact, according to ancient Chinese customs, our ancestors believed that the tide was highest on the Tide God's Birthday, so they had the idea that the 18th day of the eighth lunar month was the highest tide. The real tide may be around the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, but not necessarily on the 18th day. During the Southern Song Dynasty, the imperial government designated the Tide God's Birthday as the date for reviewing naval forces, which caused the common people to flock to the area, giving the impression of "watching the human tide as much as watching the sea tide."</p>
<p>The scene when the tide comes is roughly as follows: First, there is a sudden rustling sound from afar. At this time, the滔滔 (滔滔 táotāo: torrential) white waves begin to rush over from the horizon, like thousands of white clouds bursting out of the gray clouds. The rustling sound, like white paper tearing, is transformed into a cascading waterfall-like rushing sound in an instant.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the tide seems to be galloping like thousands of horses; followed by the roaring of the tide; like a lion's roar, like a tiger's howl, suddenly turning into the sound of all kinds of beasts roaring together. At this time, the people watching the tide cannot help but feel a sense of awe, standing silently, their eyes all fixed on the oncoming tide. The tide quickly approaches, seemingly carrying the enormous power of overturning mountains and seas, making surging, ever-changing gestures, and immediately emits a deafening roar, shaking the river and the riverbank. White waves, like mythical beasts, roll past in the blink of an eye. The water level on the riverbank immediately rises by seven or eight feet.</p>
<p>Melodious flute sounds come from the nearby temples, and the farmers and fishermen on the riverbank bow down to the tide (which in their minds is the Tide God), and firecrackers are set off all at once on the riverbank.</p>
<p>Fishing boats facing the tide also leap onto the tide, proudly ride with the wind, and speed against the current. This spectacular drama of watching the tide ends in the melodious music. Wu Ling's Old Tales records the Zhejiang tide as follows: "When it first emerges from the sea gate, it is only like a silver thread, but as it gradually approaches, it is like a jade city and a snow ridge, coming from the sky, with a loud sound like thunder, shaking and spurting, swallowing the sky and washing the sun." (Zhou Mi) From this, we can see the heroic posture of the huge Zhejiang tide in the Song Dynasty. Shicui Yutan says: "At first glance, it is a piece of green air, and as it gets closer, it is a vast expanse of white. The edge of the tide sounds like thunder, and its power is like a mountain, roaring and galloping, and in an instant, it reaches the shore, like mountains collapsing and houses falling, leaping three times and settling down, then the entire river is thousands of miles wide, and the sky and the earth are one color." (Wang Keyu) As for the spectacle of the night tide, Sishi Chushang Lu once had a passage: "The wind suddenly turns cold, the sea gate rises, the moonlight and silver waves shimmer, the light swaying like splashing snow, the clouds move like jade banks, the waves roll and crash, and the white silk flutters in the wind, twisting and turning, its momentum is like mountains galloping, making people shudder."

<h3>YUYAO TONGSHANTANG: Japanese-buried Items Found in Small Garden: Type 38 Rifle Bayonets and More</h3>
<p>[Yuyao, 1st (News)] Yaojian Normal School held a weekend sports meeting on the afternoon of September 27th, with a flower garden construction competition. When the students were digging the ground and picking up stones in the small garden of Tongshantang, they suddenly found a Type 38 rifle bayonet. Driven by curiosity, the students were sure that it had been buried when the enemy surrendered, so they continued to dig and found more than a dozen spades, four bayonets, and nine cross-shaped tools. Digging down to about a foot deep, they found a piece of cowhide about a foot long and six or seven inches wide. Under the cowhide was chaff, and at the very bottom was a large stone. They immediately telegraphed the police station for inspection. On the 30th, the police station sent six street cleaners to continue digging.</p>

<h3>Bandit in Shou County Shoots Rice Merchant</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shou County, September 27th] Banditry is rampant in the southern part of this county. On the 25th, a daylight robbery and murder occurred in Yankou Market.

At 6:00 PM on the 25th, while traveling along the Caogou River north of the market, gunshots rang out, and bullets rained down. Wang Shubin died on the spot. Zhu Xikuan and the others tried to escape, scattering in all directions, but they were surrounded by more than ten bandits who forced them to hand over 2 million in cash and two rifles. They then shot and killed Zhu Xikuan before fleeing. The case is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Autumn Tide High, Seawall Collapses, Yamping Engineering Office Intensively Repairing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Pinghu, 1st] On the eve of the autumn tide, frequent reports came from seawall patrols. The Haiyan-Pinghu section of the Yamping area, under the impact of the Zhapu estuary, suffered frequent collapses. The entire stone seawall from "Wang" to "Ming," numbered 48, was completely destroyed, with seawater rushing into the breach, relying entirely on the earthen road embankment for protection. From Haiyan Nantan to the Fifth Regiment, the base of the stone seawall in front of the Chi Hai Temple was severely damaged. The entire stone seawall from "Zi" to "Lin," numbered 16, collapsed. From Zhapu to Jinsiniang Bridge, near Dushan, one section of the stone seawall collapsed, with the attached earth sinking. From Guandi Temple to Dengya Bridge, Luotangtou, the base of the original gap was hollow, and the entire "Duan" numbered section was tilted outward for hundreds of meters. The Yamping Engineering Office is currently working intensively to repair it, hoping to protect the harvest of crops along the seawall.</p>
<h3>Strange Conscription Event in the Fifth District of Xibei: Guidance Society Runner Introduces Volunteers, Uses Hard Wooden Pole to Beat Village Head</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Wuxi, 1st] In Liucang Township, Fifth District of Xibei, six volunteer soldiers are still needed for this conscription. Township Head Zhu Fengqi recruited three, leaving three still needed. Zhu Township Head's uncle, Longzhang, went to the city to ask a Guidance Society runner to introduce three more. Yesterday (the 1st) at 2:00 PM, eight people, including the introducer, went to the township to collect the money. Zhu Longzhang instructed the village heads to collect it from each household. Zhou Pangen, the village head of the Fourth Village, collected 1 million and sent it to Zhu Longzhang's home. Zhu criticized Zhou for bringing too little and secretly instructed the eight people to beat Zhou Pangen with hard wooden poles. Zhou was nearly dead, but then revived. Seeing the disaster they had caused, the people fled to the city. Zhou Pangen went to the county court on the 2nd to get a medical examination and requested legal action. On the same day, the township heads and village leaders also came to the city to petition the county government, demanding that Zhu Longzhang be severely punished and ordered to hand over the eight assailants for legal action.</p>

<h3>Promotion of Chinese Language Best in Mongolian Banner Areas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang all have special languages. Therefore, the teaching materials and reading materials used in these areas must be translated into Chinese and border languages. It was recently learned from the Ministry of Education that the promotion of border strengthening education is best in the Mongolian Banner areas for the promotion of Chinese.

Tibet ranks second. When Mongolian-Tibetan textbooks are used in Tibet, the number of people learning Chinese and Tibetan is about half each. However, those learning Tibetan often read Chinese outside of class. The situation in Xinjiang is special. Although Mongolian-Xinjiang textbooks have also been compiled, the results of promotion are poor. As for the indigenous peoples of the mainland, most of them have no writing or only simple writing.

<p>Yesterday, all quarter-final matches of the open tennis tournament were completed. In the final match of the advanced singles, Tao Guanqiu faced McLagan. In a very short time, Tao won three sets in a row, losing only two games, eliminating McLagan and advancing to the finals against Wang Wenzheng. McLagan's crushing defeat was unexpected.</p>
<p>The finals of each group will begin today. The tension will be far greater than the quarter-finals. Each group represents the best players in the tennis world this season. This tournament is being closely watched by all parties.</p>
<p>Today's final match order: Gao Zhenchuan vs. Sun Yifang (Intermediate Singles) 3:30 PM; Tao Guanqiu vs. Li Guoyao (Mixed Doubles) 4:30 PM; Zhu Zhiying vs. Pan Luying (Mixed Doubles) 4:30 PM</p>

As for the league prizes, because the medals have not yet been made, they will not be displayed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Match</p>
<p>Yesterday's match between Tao and McLagan progressed faster than expected. McLagan reversed his fierce style of the previous days and became a docile lamb. He was not rushing to hit the ball, and frequently hit the net or out of bounds. The key reason was that the ground was loose after the rain, and the ball's bounce was weaker, so his signature forehand could not be used. In addition, he lacked experience and could not get to the net, leading to a complete failure. Tao won all six games in the first set, and lost one game each in the second and third sets, taking only three quarters of an hour.</p>

<h3>Seven Chinese Teams Participate in Competition - Hong Kong Football League Opens - South China Suffers Heavy Defeat Early, Kitchee Wins Over Bus Team - Chinese Team Victorious, Eastern and Guanghua Teams Defeated</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The autumn is crisp and refreshing, and it is the football season. The Hong Kong 1947-48 football league opened after the Wooden Shield competition. Fifteen teams in Group A are participating in the championship this season, with Chinese teams accounting for seven: Star Island, Kitchee, Bus Team, Eastern, South China, Guanghua, and Chinese Team. Group B is divided into two groups for mixed battles. There are also two more stadiums than last year, including the South China Association, Naval Stadium, Hong Kong Club, and the newly opened Army Stadium in Hong Kong, and a Police Stadium in Kowloon.</p>
<p>Strength Observation</p>
<p>After the weekend's performance, the strength of each team has been revealed. The strongest Western team is Devan Army, followed by Inness and the Artillery. As for the Chinese teams, Star Island has not returned from its expedition. Although the South China team has returned triumphantly with its full force, it has been unable to form a team due to player treatment issues, so most of the good players have not yet appeared on the field, and it seems that there will be major changes in the team formation. The league is a round-robin system, and the competition will be fierce in the future.</p>
<p>Kitchee's First Victory</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 27th, the league opened, with four games in Group A. The most important battle was between two newly promoted Chinese teams in Group A. Kitchee fought the Bus team at the Police Stadium. The Bus team had four national players, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Tan Jiangbai, and Zhuo Shijin, while Kitchee was based on last year's Star Island B team, supplemented by Guo Yingqi, Liu, and Cai.</p>
<p>Kitchee Team</p>
<p>Zhang Guan Yu</p>
<p>Hui Zhongyun Zheng Yingquan</p>
<p>Tan Zhenhui Shan Yousheng Liu Mo Cai</p>
<p>Huang Jingcong Guo Yingqi Li Bingzhao Tan Huanzhang Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Bus Team</p>
<p>Sun Binan</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Tan Jiajun Deng Xuanjie Deng Sen</p>
<p>Zhong Jingsheng Zhuo Shijin Tan Jiangbai Zhang Songgen Qian Chiihui</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes after the start of the war, the bus was still able to hold on, but before the dust, Kitchee received a remote lead with a score of 3-0. After changing defense, Guo Yingqi scored a penalty, 4-0. The bus team finally broke the egg with a long shot from Tan Jiangbai. In the end, Kitchee's Deng Guangsen scored, ending the game with a score of 5-1.</p>
<p>South China's Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>South China fought Inness at the Naval Stadium. Because the South China team could not form a team, they hastily went into battle and suffered a crushing defeat of 6-1, the most disastrous defeat in South China's history.</p>
<p>In the other two Western team matches, the artillery team won against the navy with six goals, and the Hong Kong club defeated the police with a score of 4-1.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 28th, Star Island was on a bye, with three games in Group A. Three Chinese teams played at the same time:</p>
<p>Eastern Team Defeated</p>
<p>The Eastern team competed against St. Joseph at the Hong Kong Club Stadium. The strengths of the two sides were at the same level, and the Eastern team finally lost a penalty, with a score of 4-3. The Eastern team lost due to insufficient morale, coupled with goalkeeper Liang Dingtang, who was restless and ruined the big event.</p>
<p>At the Army Stadium, the strongest Western team, Devan, faced the weakest Chinese team, Guanghua, which was naturally one-sided, with Guanghua losing 10-1.</p>
<p>Chinese Team Victorious</p>
<p>At the Police Stadium in Kowloon, the Chinese team, which had just won the Golden Shield championship, played against the Air Force. The Chinese team, with its youthful spirit, subdued the flying strongmen, with a score of 3-1 in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, Guo Zhuochang added another goal, ending the game with a score of 4-1. This was the army's only victory today. The Chinese team's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Qi'en</p>
<p>Li Guowei He Jiaqiang</p>
<p>Chen Jinpei Kong Qingyu He Youji</p>
<p>Liang Bingkun Li Chunfa Miao Changrong Guo Zhuochang Li Wenhui</p>

The forward exchange interest rate was originally set at 4% per month, but is now changed to 8% for the first month, 11% for the second month, and 15% for the third month. The forward exchange interest for a three-month period will be 34%.</p>
<p>He said: The main purpose of this measure is to increase the interest burden of forward exchange and reduce the large-scale forward exchange purchases by importers. It will help exporters, as exporters can still apply for early loans from banks based on letters of credit.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the total value of exports in the four weeks after the establishment of the Balancing Committee exceeded the average monthly value of exports before the war. The value of exports in the recent two weeks is also balanced with the average weekly value of exports in the past four weeks. This shows that the export situation has indeed improved. Moreover, it is now the export season, and if transportation is not subject to unexpected delays, the export situation will continue to improve daily.</p>
<p>The world market prices of our country's export goods, except for tung oil, have not seen significant depreciation. When tung oil was purchased by the China Trust Bureau, it was only US$0.20 per pound, but it gradually increased to US$0.25. Recently, due to the dumping of 2,000 tons by a tung oil merchant in Hong Kong, it plummeted to US$0.22. However, the market price is now gradually improving, and the market price of pig bristles is still stable.</p>
<h3>Many Parties Close Out Positions - The Situation of Chinese Stocks is Uncertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market encountered the day of the transfer period for cash delivery. The bulls finally became discouraged and closed out their positions in cash delivery. The morning market ended at a low level. In the afternoon, off-market buyers suddenly became enthusiastic, and the Cantonese banks strongly purchased, turning to a stable trend. There were not many transactions, and the future is still uncertain.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the market was flat and weak. After the opening of Yongsheng Yarn, it immediately plummeted to 260 yuan for cash delivery and 270 yuan for forward delivery. After 10:15, there were purchases at low prices, and there was a slight struggle, but soon the off-market interest rates were still high at 2.7 cents and 3.15 cents, and there were many sellers, forcing the prices down to 260 yuan and 270 yuan. Then, as the buyers were slightly smoother, they pulled up to 264 yuan and 275 yuan, but it was rumored that the labor unrest was serious, and many people were cutting losses off-market. The pavilion rats were trying to sell short in the market, and the sellers followed one after another, and the prices gradually dropped to a low price of 255 yuan and 265 yuan near noon. Forward delivery closed at 267 yuan. After the close, Yongsheng Yarn was called lower, and as a result, compared with the previous close of cash delivery stocks, Yongsheng underwear Liann Jinglun Matches Zhongfang Zhabei Hengfeng slightly decreased, Xinhe Maya Huafeng Xinguang Jingfu Sino-French Qinxing Zhongsi Tongyi Rongfeng Huaxin each fell by half a percent, Xinhua fell by ten percent. In terms of forward delivery stocks, Yongsheng slightly rose, Xinhe slightly fell, and Hua fell by half a percent.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, there were repeated acquisitions, and the National Bank's difference was not much. Yongsheng gradually rose to a high price of 260 yuan for cash delivery and 268.5 yuan for delivery, before there were sell-offs. Afterwards, it closed at 258 yuan and 268 yuan. As a result, compared with the most recent close of cash delivery stocks, Yongsheng Xinhe Maya Xinguang Jingfu underwear slightly rose, Huafeng Xinhua matches Xinya Hengfeng Zhongfang Zhabei Tongyi Rongfeng were flat, Qinxing Zhongsi slightly decreased, and Huaxin fell by half a percent again, further away from the premium. In terms of forward delivery stocks, Xinhe was still flat, Yongsheng Liangfu slightly rose, and Maya Huafeng Xinguang slightly decreased. Various old stocks off-market fell a little again.</p>
<p>In the current transfer period, the arbitrage interest rate was about 1.6 to 2 cents, and the bulls were unwilling to bear the premium, so the initial high continued to be low. The banks helped to advance, but the bulls were not crowded. Yongsheng opened at 11 yuan, and retreated from 11.5 yuan to close at 9.5 yuan. Maya retreated from 18.5 yuan to 14 yuan, and closed at 14.5 yuan. Xinhe fell from 6.5 yuan to 4.5 yuan.</p>

As a result, compared with the previous close, Yeguang fell by half a percent, Wheelock Marden Navigation was flat, and the rest slightly decreased.</p>
<h3>Pre-War Debt - Repayment Method</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to a report from the United Credit Bureau, the pre-war debt repayment method passed by the Political Affairs Conference the other day only applies to the settlement of value relations between private individuals and banks. It does not apply to government bonds issued by the state, debts between individuals, and debt relations between government agencies and banks.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Supply is Smooth - Japonica and Indica Trends are Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the north and south markets together had more than 17,100 stones of rice. In the early morning market in the south, both japonica and indica rice fell, and stabilized at noon. As a result, japonica and indica rice still tended to be weak, falling back by 35,000 to 10,000 yuan. The northern market opened tight, and also became slack at noon. In the end, due to the influx of sources, it was still sluggish. There are more than 300 rice boats stored in Hubie and Hexia in the southern market, totaling about 30,000 stones, and the future may be difficult to share the prosperity.</p>
<p>There are continuous shipments of flour from other places, and the market is sluggish, falling back by 3,4000 yuan. Unified powder and miscellaneous brand powder each fell by 3,5000 yuan, and the price of rationed powder remained unchanged, but it was higher than the various powders on the market, so there were very few applicants. The actual sales of bran were sluggish, falling back by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake and oil head remained unchanged, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories and main streets successively purchased, and the goods were scarce and strong, gradually increasing by 35,000 yuan, and the future situation is still promising. Mung beans from Nanyang were cold and sluggish, gradually decreasing by 6,7000 yuan.</p>

Rapeseed oil supply was greater than demand, and it sharply decreased by 230,000 yuan. The grid of soybean oil was flat and weak, and refined oil followed the decline by 10,000 yuan, and rationed oil continued to be processed.</p>

<p>Recently, green tea such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, which tea merchants in the city promoted to North Africa, has now found an outlet, which has gradually revealed clues in the buying sentiment in yesterday's market, while the number of transactions is still sporadically opened in the special goods that hold up. Although the market has not made significant progress, it is more stable than before.</p>
<p>Qimen black tea, the sellers' asking prices also consistently increased by 10-20%, but unfortunately, buyers, in view of the weak demand abroad, and the sparing prices, are still unwilling to rush to take, and the process is quite a game of back and forth.</p>
<p>Various domestic sales tea, in addition to the continued sluggish sales in the Tianjin area, the sales in the main street shops and Suzhou, Wuxi and other places are still smooth, and the market is upward.</p>
<h3>Sugar Steps Loosely</h3>

<h3>Yarn Merchants' Representatives Visit Wu Weijing - Requesting a Review of the Stopped Allocation Numbers - Cloth Merchants Refuse to Open Central Textile Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's Yarn Merchants' Association believes that the Textile Construction Company's recent announcement to stop allocating yarn to 284 members of the association is due to inaccurate investigations. Yesterday, they sent representatives Tang Zhiliang, Shen Boqin, Yin Peiyuan, Chen Junming and other four to visit Wu Weijing, deputy general manager of the Textile Construction Company, requesting that the stopped allocation numbers be reviewed immediately. Wu said that if the stopped allocation numbers are considered inaccurate, they can submit a letter for review, and hoped that the heads of the association would provide assistance and provide information for the company to refer to.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Cotton Cloth Association is automatically investigating the member firms whose numbers have been suspended by Textile Construction, starting yesterday, and will provide it to Textile Construction for reference after the investigation is completed.

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was stagnant due to tight funds from all parties. The number of entries was scattered, and there were many resales in the market, showing a hovering trend. The market for the whole day, except for the hot-selling dragon head and other fine cloths and plain cloth, grey twill, the market was slightly better by 2,3000 to 120,000 yuan, and the rest of the cloths had no glory or shame.</p>

<p>The plant still had a very quiet transaction due to the fact that the capital had not yet loosened, and the calling prices for all levels remained at the original level, and the five dans were all lacking. The transaction price for other dans was the same as the previous day, and there was no increase or decrease in the asking price for dried.</p>
<p>The market for silk fabrics yesterday was between 712 and 30,000 yuan between the Dak Mak and Huabei goods.

<h3>The Fourth Disease: A Childhood Infectious Disease Resembling Scarlet Fever but Not Scarlet Fever</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Recently, some children in this city have contracted an infectious disease with fever and red rashes, resembling scarlet fever in appearance, but it is actually not scarlet fever and is not as severe. This is called the Fourth Disease (Fourth disease), also known as Filatov-Dukes' disease (Filatou Duke's disease). It was first recorded by Dr. Dukes in a British hospital in 1900 AD. However, Russian physician Filatov had also reported it several years earlier, so the disease is named Filatov-Dukes' disease, combining both names.</p>
<p>The cause of this disease is still unclear today. Many people claim it belongs to the rubella family of diseases. However, it is actually different from rubella.</p>
<p>The targets of infection are mostly children. After infection, there must be an incubation period of nine days to three weeks, and then a slight fever is felt, while red rashes appear on the body. However, some may experience headaches and nausea first. The rash consists of small rose-red spots, starting from the lips and nose, gradually spreading to the chest, upper limbs, abdomen, and lower limbs, and then to the whole body. These rashes do not rise above the surface of the skin. There are also no mucosal rashes. However, the conjunctiva and throat may appear slightly congested. The cervical lymph nodes may be slightly swollen, but to a lesser extent than in rubella. The rash fades in two or three days. Afterwards, there is no skin pigmentation. Peeling occurs in a bran-like form, completely shedding in one or two weeks.</p>
<p>The sick children do not feel very uncomfortable, and there are no complications or sequelae during the illness.</p>
<p>Although the illness is very mild, diagnosis is not easy because it is very similar to rubella or scarlet fever. However, diagnosis is not difficult in the middle of the illness.</p>
<p>Since this disease is not dangerous, no medication is needed for treatment. Just pay attention to its course and nutrition.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Whooping Cough and Its Treatment (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shou Zaiwu</p>
<p>Second stage: The longest period, with more severe coughing and thick, sticky phlegm. Coughing occurs in spasms, the face is tense, and the complexion is red and purple. After coughing, a deep, long breath is inhaled. Coughing sounds are incessant, the neck and back are hunched, and once the coughing subsides slightly, phlegm and food are vomited until the stomach is empty. It is lighter during the day and heavier at night.</p>
<p>Third stage: The recovery period. Coughing gradually becomes lighter, the paroxysms significantly decrease, phlegm is easier to cough up, there is no vomiting, one can eat, sleep is better at night, and the patient's condition gradually improves.</p>
<p>The importance of whooping cough lies not only in the long-term coughing, which depletes physical strength, frequent vomiting, which leads to nutritional loss, and frequent coughing at night, which disturbs sleep, but also in the physical spasms during coughing, which cause the chest muscles to contract and relax irregularly. The lungs and trachea are directly affected by external pressure, leading to insufficient gas exchange in the blood and congestion in the local lung tissue. This can result in nosebleeds, throat bleeding, rupture and bleeding of the tracheal mucosa, perforation of the lung tissue leading to pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, conjunctival hemorrhage, eyeball hemorrhage, and retinal hemorrhage. Bleeding in the ear and meningeal hemorrhage are particularly important complications of this disease. It can also lead to limb spasms, left and right hemiplegia, coma and recovery, heart failure, or physical and mental exhaustion. Various reasons can lead to death. In those with rickets, it can develop into hilar tuberculosis. Those already infected with hilar tuberculosis can develop active and severe pulmonary tuberculosis. Furthermore, miliary (i.e., disseminated) pulmonary tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis can often develop from whooping cough. The induction of chronic meningitis is also a common fact of this disease. I once saw a long advertisement in the news offering a huge sum of money to find families with chronic meningitis that had been cured several times, but the results were likely impossible to achieve. Young infants who contract this disease are prone to pneumonia, especially those under three months old, making it particularly dangerous. I once saw a magazine report that a pregnant woman had whooping cough before giving birth, and the baby also had whooping cough when it was born, indicating the importance of this disease.</p>
<p>The treatment for whooping cough requires isolation of the affected child. If in school, teachers should order the child to return home for treatment and only return to school after recovery. If at home, children who have not contracted the disease should live and eat separately. The living space should be spacious and well-ventilated, not too cold in summer and not too hot in winter. Any food that is not difficult to digest or irritating can be given for three meals a day. Rice porridge, rice, vegetables, milk, and meat can all be eaten freely. When vomiting is severe, liquids are easier to swallow than solids, and semi-solid food is more appropriate. Repeat feeding after vomiting. Cough medicine should be taken according to the stage of the disease. Antipyretics should be given mainly through injections. Whooping cough vaccines may or may not be effective for early prevention. If there is a tendency or suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis, Stryptomycin can be tried. However, the latter is extremely expensive and requires continuous injections, which is difficult for ordinary families to afford, making it a drawback. Moderate use can cure many cases of whooping cough.</p>
<p>In summary, whooping cough is generally considered an insignificant disease in Chinese society. No attention is paid at the beginning, and families with some knowledge often take over-the-counter medicines such as white pine syrup, cough syrup, and creosote. Over weeks and months, the disease deepens, and it becomes difficult to cure when seeking medical help again. Some also take almond juice internally, boil sparrows in soup internally, or take saliva from a frightened person internally, calling them folk remedies. These non-physical and chemical treatments cannot be effective after all. Aunt Wang says this remedy is really effective. Grandma Zhang says this remedy is very effective. Patients who seek medical help say that folk remedies have all been tried one by one, but none are effective. From this, the effectiveness can be known. In today's developed new medicine, although there is no specific medicine for whooping cough that can cure it immediately and effectively, shortening the course of the disease, reducing pain, and avoiding harm are also goals of treatment. The neighbor's grandmother says that whooping cough heals itself when blood is seen. An old fellow villager from Shandong says that my child was healed in three days. These are all unfounded claims and should not be believed. I once saw a young child with whooping cough that lasted for eight months. Blood was seen three times, for a total of more than ten days, but he still recovered through careful diagnosis and treatment. As for mild cases, treatment is easier, but how many people recover without medicine? According to clinical experience, about 70% or more of those with whooping cough are cured, but the time required is the only focus of treatment for this disease.</p>
<h3>Prognosis and Nursing of Typhoid Fever Patients</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>People often talk about illnesses among relatives and friends. If they know it is a cold with a fever, most people do not pay much attention, thinking that a cold with a fever will not cause any danger. But if they hear it is typhoid fever, their expressions inevitably become very tense. Why is this? Because typhoid fever can lead to death. Even if one is lucky enough to survive, they will have to stay in bed for at least one or two months. It is currently late summer and early autumn, which is the season when typhoid fever is prevalent. What are the dangers after contracting typhoid fever? I think this is something everyone wants to know.</p>
<p>Speaking of whether there is danger after contracting typhoid fever and the degree of danger, this is called prognosis in medicine. The prognosis for typhoid fever patients is certainly not optimistic because many patients with mild conditions suddenly experience intestinal bleeding or intestinal perforation, leading to death. From general observations, we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>Systemic symptoms, such as a very high fever, consistently above 40 degrees Celsius, and a rapid and weak pulse, consistently above 120, indicate a very dangerous prognosis.</p>
<p>Severe neurological symptoms, such as picking at the air, fidgeting in bed, mania, shouting angrily, hitting around, or delirium, muttering, or even severe headaches, opisthotonos, hyperesthesia, and stiff neck, resembling meningitis, are called pseudomeningitis or typhoid meningitis, and the prognosis is mostly dangerous.</p>
<p>Typhoid fever is often accompanied by bronchitis or bronchiolitis. If the patient is drowsy during the onset of typhoid fever, it is difficult to cough up secretions from the bronchioles, and they are often lying down, it is easy to develop severe bronchiolitis. This small bronchiolitis can easily cause bronchopneumonia, which can then lead to hypostatic pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, which is also a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>During typhoid fever, there is often some protein in the urine (below 0.5%). If the protein increases, urine output decreases, and there is blood and casts in the urine, it means nephritis has developed, and the prognosis is also poor.</p>
<p>Constitution and individual factors are also relevant. Intestinal perforation and intestinal bleeding are less common in children with typhoid fever than in adults. Although neurological symptoms can sometimes be very severe, the prognosis is better than in adults. In elderly people with typhoid fever, although the fever may not be very high, their neurological symptoms, respiratory and circulatory disorders are often very severe, so the outcome is often unfavorable. Obese people and heavy drinkers often have weak heart function, so the prognosis is also poor. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>On Misers</h3>
<p>— Qi Ping</p>
<p>Misers certainly have their inimitable qualities. For example, most of them are self-made individuals who have struggled with society since childhood, and their spirit of perseverance is quite admirable. However, on the other hand, "life is like a dream, how much joy is there?" Their degree of "self-denial" is really too self-afflictive!</p>
<p>Professor Parsons of New York University in the United States is a specialist in the study of misers. The information he has collected on misers is unparalleled in the world. His conclusion from years of research on this subject is that most misers lead miserable lives!</p>
<p>The most miserable miser must be Fougères, a French tycoon in the 19th century. He hoarded all the wealth he had accumulated throughout his life, and even installed a secret door at the entrance to the cellar, which no outsider could possibly know about. One night, when he lit a candle to count his money, a gust of wind suddenly slammed the secret door shut, and Fougères was buried alive in the cellar! Outsiders had no idea where he had gone, and misers all lived in seclusion, so no one cared about the life or death of those stingy ghosts. Years later, someone bought the house and wanted to build a wine cellar, and unintentionally discovered Mr. Fougères, who had starved to death next to his huge stash of gold - poor fellow, he had chewed away most of the candle, and had even gnawed away a lot of the meat on his body!</p>
<p>In medieval England, there was a miser named Oveross. This man was a bachelor with a lot of hidden gold and was extremely suspicious of his servants, fearing that they would covet his wealth. According to the customs of the time, servants did not need to fast and mourn when a family member died. So Oveross had a brilliant idea and immediately pretended to be dead in order to save money. But his servants did not care about this and instead started eating heartily after the master died. Oveross secretly peeked from the deathbed and was so enraged that he sat bolt upright. The servant thought a ghost had appeared, grabbed a rake leaning against the wall, and struck the master hard - this time, Oveross really died.</p>
<p>There was also an 80-year-old widower in England who went to see a doctor when he was seriously ill. The doctor advised him to drink a little wine. The old man was shocked, because he had countless bottles of fine wine hidden at home, but he was afraid of letting others know and would rather spend money to buy a little - because money was a good thing that he was reluctant to part with. He finally gave in and walked step by step to the wine cellar, but he was old and weak, stumbled, and immediately lost his life.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, there was a nervous merchant in Paris who suddenly felt that there would definitely be a white kerosene panic in the world. He used all his property to buy white kerosene and hoard it. But the white kerosene panic never happened, and the man wasted all his efforts, and all the white kerosene rotted. Many years later, his neighbors found his body in a pile of rotten white kerosene.</p>
<p>The most famous miser in the United States was a woman named Hetty Green. When Hetty was young, she was a beautiful, intelligent, and popular girl. But after her aunt left her an inheritance worth one hundred American dollars, she immediately changed her ways. She mingled with some of the most ruthless and vicious merchants on Wall Street, learned to be sharp and quick, and only knew how to make money for herself, regardless of whether other people lived or died. She made a fortune, but she wore the same old black dress every day and lived alone in a cheap apartment. When she occasionally went out to eat, the waiter never expected to get a penny of tip from her. She "suffered" all her life, and when she died of illness in 1916, she left behind more than $100 million in property.</p>

<h3>Cremation and Burial at Sea</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>In this degenerate world, it is difficult to live and equally difficult to die. Wealthy families spend lavishly during their lives and have grand funerals after death, which is understandable. The most difficult situation is for the proletariat, who struggle for a living during their lives and never get any rest. If they unfortunately die, the cost of funeral arrangements and burial will deplete their assets and still be insufficient, and the living expenses of the surviving family members are not guaranteed. Therefore, from the perspective of thorough frugality, cremation and burial at sea are necessary to promote.</p>
<p>The other day, the old educator and musician, former principal of Nanyang Public School Affiliated Elementary School, Shen Shuda (Xin Gong), held a burial at sea after cremation. His wise son also followed his father's will and published a farewell notice to relatives and friends in the newspaper instead of sending out obituaries, and used the money saved from funeral expenses and condolences from relatives and friends as a music scholarship fund. This is a good and beautiful idea and worthy of emulation. Frugal funerals should be promoted for three reasons:</p>
<p>First, from an economic standpoint, as the ancients said: "When the country is poor, talk about frugality and frugal funerals." Frugality is a matter of life, reducing clothing and food, abandoning extravagance, and not wasting. A frugal funeral is a matter after death. Lavish funerals and excessive rituals should be avoided. Saving a thousand or ten thousand for one family, ten families is millions, and extending this, it may be possible to cure the country's poverty by one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of etiquette, extravagant funerals are originally a means for descendants to flaunt their wealth and superstition, which contradicts the principles of social economy and is inconsistent with the ancients. Mozi did not approve of extravagant funerals and long mourning periods and established a burial method, saying: "A coffin three inches thick is enough to rot the bones, three layers of clothing are enough to rot the flesh, dig the ground deep, so that there is no leakage below, and no gas vents above. The mound is enough to mark its location, and that is all." He even further stated that extravagant funerals and long mourning periods, heavy coffins and outer coffins, many clothes and bedding, sending off the dead as if moving, three years of mourning, being supported when standing up, walking with a cane, the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, is enough to ruin the world.</p>
<p>Third, from a philosophical point of view, the most thorough approach is what Yan Pingzhong said to Guan Zhong: "Once dead, what is there to do with me? Burn it, sink it, bury it, expose it, wrap it in firewood and throw it into a ditch, or wrap it in embroidered robes and bury it in a stone coffin, whatever fate may bring..." (Liezi Yang Zhu Chapter)</p>
<p>The so-called burning it or sinking it is an explanation of cremation and burial at sea. The number of coffins awaiting burial in Shanghai is the highest among the world's major cities, numbering more than 100,000. An article in the American "Life Magazine" about Mayor Wu's work on Shanghai's municipal administration included a photo of coffins piled high like mountains in funeral homes, which is shocking. If people in society can change their mindset and promote cremation and burial at sea, it will also be a way to solve many intractable problems.</p>
<h3>On Filial Piety</h3>
<p>— Ding Ye</p>
<p>No one reads the Classic of Filial Piety now, and I guess no one reads the Biographies of Exemplary Women either. We haven't seen the illustrations of the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars for a long time. But recently, a small booklet called "Illustrated Compendium of Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars and Twenty-Four Filial Women" has been printed and published, doubling the previous number to a total of forty-eight filial exemplars. It is said that it sold quite a few copies during "Father's Day." Parents probably bought it for their children, hoping that they would learn this Chinese "ancient filial piety"!</p>
<p>Speaking of "filial piety," Chinese history is full of stories about it. Emperors "governed the world with filial piety," and officials should "serve their parents with filial piety before serving their rulers with loyalty." Since Confucius and Mencius, gentlemen who promoted filial piety have followed one after another, so China relies on this to remain a country of morality. Now, the gentlemen have specially printed the Forty-Eight Filial Exemplars. This booklet can be called a complete work that collects filial sons from all dynasties in one book.</p>
<p>I know that the first half of this book, the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, was written by Guo Juye of the Yuan Dynasty. According to the editor, the second half, the Twenty-Four Filial Women, was compiled by modern people. It is said that the purpose of printing this book is to "benefit the world's morals and people's hearts." It is also hoped that "if everyone can extend their love for their parents to love their families, love their country, and love humanity, then advancing the world to great harmony will also start with this book!" The editor's intention is great enough!</p>
<p>But my prejudice has always been a little disgusted with the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars. I don't know how I saw this great work that "advances the world to great harmony starting with this book," which makes me feel like I have a bone stuck in my throat, and I have to spit out the unpleasant words. If this book is printed for the middle-aged generation, I think they are already fathers themselves, and they only hope that their sons will be filial to them. They may not be happy if they have to follow the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars to be filial to old people over sixty years old. If it is made for the younger generation to read, I dare not wish them to read this book. Because if the stories in this book are analyzed from a modern perspective, many of them not only do not benefit young people, but also contain superstitious, cruel, and unintelligent poisons.</p>
<p>For example, Meng Zong "weeping for bamboo to produce shoots" and Wang Xiang "lying on ice to seek carp" are fundamentally unreasonable miracles. How can Dong Yong "selling himself to bury his father" meet a fairy, isn't this close to encouraging people to be otherworldly? Also, what is the thinking behind Guo Ju and his wife's "burying their son for the sake of their mother," they killed their next generation to save the old and decaying! Is it possible to let people today play this set again! Everyone learns from Lao Laizi's "playing with colors to please his parents" and Yu Qianlou's "tasting feces to worry about his parents" to "advance the world to great harmony." I really admire Mr. Gang's painstaking efforts!</p>
<p>Secondly, such as the newly compiled Twenty-Four Filial Women, most of them inherit the meaning of the previous Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars. The difference is that the so-called "never changing after marriage," the editor does not know what is the intention, to ask modern women to abide by the "virtuous women do not serve two husbands" doctrine? Also, Wang Lanzhen's "speaking frankly to advise her father," she privately burned the Romance of the Western Chamber and Dream of the Red Chamber that her father had hand-written notes on. The editor probably thinks it is a "virtuous thing," but these two works have been recognized as valuable works since the May Fourth Movement. How much research has been published on the Dream of the Red Chamber after Hu Shi, and it was once even compiled into textbooks. The editor does not know if he knows these things? If not, you can look through the "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction." Finally, there is an article called "Blood from the Arm to Make Pills," which must be said. This matter is transformed from "cutting flesh to heal relatives," but this poison still exists today, and there is no need for the editor to promote it again. A Hangzhou newsletter was recently reported: "Zhao Xiuying, a female student in a middle school in this city, cut flesh to heal her relatives, and fainted on the spot..." According to the editor, this is "beneficial to the world's morals and people's hearts."</p>

<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Miss America in the Family</p>
<p>Those who do not understand the American family environment certainly have a wrong perception of American women, believing that American women, apart from dancing, watching movies, typing, and swimming, are generally indifferent to household chores. The truth is quite the opposite. It should be known that most American families cannot afford maids, and everything from cooking, washing, sweeping, to gardening must be done by themselves. Moreover, each person does their own tasks; mothers do not usually wash their daughters' clothes. Therefore, a young lady living in a household has many things to take care of. Even if she leaves her parents and rents an apartment, she must bear all the chores. Getting up in the morning, she goes into the kitchen to brew coffee and toast bread on the electric stove. After breakfast, she tidies the room or mops the floor. There are electric sweepers for sweeping, but there is no machine for mopping the floor, so she still has to rely on a mop. After finishing work, she goes to the office or school. Lunch is mostly eaten in restaurants, but some people also bring lunch boxes and thermos bottles to eat at their workplaces. Those lunch boxes are very exquisitely made, some like a cosmetic case, some are transparent, revealing a thermos bottle and two sandwiches, which are not cumbersome or conspicuous to carry. Coming home from work, she cooks a hearty dinner. After dinner, she washes a few odd pieces of clothing or does some needlework. It is easy to find a hand-cranked sewing machine in Miss America's boudoir. That kind of sewing machine is as small as a toy, and you can sew seasonal fashions on that small sewing machine. However, formal dresses and expensive clothes are mostly custom-made in clothing stores, and the sewing is quite expensive. What you can do yourself, you will never buy from clothing stores. In America, using a washing machine to wash clothes is not a big deal. You just put the soap powder and clothes in the washing machine, turn on the power, and in three to five minutes, it's done. But ironing clothes requires manual labor, which is more troublesome, especially in summer, when there are many clothes and the weather is hot. This is a relatively heavy task in housework. Only after finishing a day's work can you go out to attend banquets. Sunday seems to be relatively leisurely, but in reality, it is even busier. In the morning, she changes into new clothes and goes to church for worship, which every young lady should participate in, unless she has no religious beliefs. After returning from worship, most people spend their time cleaning the house, mopping the floor, airing carpets, washing cars, watering flowers, and planting vegetables. If there is a vegetable garden behind the house, some people also paint floors and whitewash walls on Sundays, exhausting their delicate bodies. Such work has a special home economics course in universities and middle schools, so 99% of American women know how to cook and sew and handle household chores in an orderly manner. On the other hand, Chinese ladies who pride themselves on being virtuous grow up being served by servants, gradually shifting their activity centers to dance halls, nightclubs, and cinemas. Chinese ladies have already lost the virtues of the old era and have not yet acquired the life skills of the new era, creating many social butterflies, young mistresses, vases, and even concubines and dancers in society. This can also be said to be a failure of the new era of education, a comedy in the process of Europeanization.</p>
<p>Things</p>
<h3>Remembering Powell</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>On February 28th of this year, when the University of Missouri alumni association held a meeting in Washington, Powell gave a speech expounding on the situation in the Far East. He said, "If a war breaks out between the United States and the Soviet Union, the battlefield will definitely be in the Far East, not in Europe. In Asia today, communism, imperialism, and American democracy are competing with each other. The tendency of hundreds of millions of people in China and India depends entirely on the future direction of the United States. In the Far East, Siberia, China, and India are three major political regions, especially China, which is the key to Asia. To maintain our position in the Far East, we must use our intelligence and skills to help Asia and transform Asia."</p>
<p>Powell's name is not unfamiliar in China. He is the father of Little Powell, the current host of the China Weekly Review. Powell was from Missouri. He studied journalism at the University of Missouri, and after graduating, he engaged in journalism in Hannibal. He then returned to his alma mater as a lecturer. After that, he was an editor and reporter for various newspapers, gradually showing his talent in the newspaper world. In 1917, he went to Shanghai and took over the China Weekly Review, using his sharp pen to discuss the Far East and the world political situation, with many insightful and unique views.</p>
<p>Powell spent more than 20 years in China, always paying attention to the situation in the Far East and reporting it to the world. When Japan planned to invade China, he was the first to expose its ambitions and issued warnings to the world. The September 18th Incident proved that Powell's arguments were accurate. A year before the Lugouqiao Incident, Powell wrote a novel for the Chicago Tribune, implying Japan's preparations for war in the Far East. Powell was a famous reporter and author, especially for Far Eastern issues, he had in-depth research. If the countries had trusted Powell's remarks earlier, Japan would not have been so rampant.</p>
<p>Powell exposed Japan's ambitions and conspiracies everywhere, which was certainly resented by the Japanese, but there was nothing they could do. When the Japanese revealed their hideous faces and openly invaded China, Powell should have left his dangerous environment. But for the sake of human justice, he resolutely stayed in Shanghai and continued his work. As Shanghai fell into an isolated island, the power of the enemy and puppets expanded day by day in the concessions. Powell, who was regarded as a thorn in their side, naturally wanted to get rid of him. At first, they instigated traitors to expel him from the country, but Powell ignored them. A fake "secret agent" threw a grenade at him on Sichuan Road, but fortunately, he was unharmed. Under the enemy's threats and intimidation, Powell could not shake his sense of justice, and his remarks became even more sharp.</p>
<p>After the Pearl Harbor Incident, the enemy entered the concessions. Powell could not escape the enemy's clutches and was imprisoned in a concentration camp. He spent seven months in prison in the Broadway Mansion before being sent back to his country on a prisoner exchange ship. In those seven months, Powell's weight decreased by two-fifths, and one of his legs became numb and unable to move. Finally, it was amputated after returning to his country. After the victory, he still used one leg to go to Tokyo and testify at the Far East International Tribunal.</p>
<p>When Powell finished his speech at the University of Missouri alumni association, he suddenly died of a heart attack. We miss this friend of China, who suffered so much for China, and we feel very uneasy in our hearts. Seeing the turbulent situation in Asia today, we should remember Powell's last words even more.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Not long after JB died a few months ago, this journal wrote a memorial article.</p>
