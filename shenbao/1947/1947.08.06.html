<h3>社論　改善公教人員待遇</h3>
<p>「改善公教人員待遇」，在目前已是最迫急最嚴重的課題了。行政院近數月來，多次進行研討，均議而不決，致使公敎人員惶惶然不可終日。惟聞本月四日，政院預算審查會關會，已決定文武職公務人員，暨敎職人員薪津，自八月份起一律調整；並決定文武職人員一律待遇。但加成數及其本數，尙待具體籌定，至十二日政務會議作最後核定。由此可知政府重視這個問題，數月以來所以不欲經易決定者，乃在避免流於草率。此次預算審查會，決定全盤調整，並將實施文武人員平等待遇，原則是可貴的，意義是重大的，我們但願政府，迅將法案成立。</p>
<p>所計待遇，係指公私組織對於所有人員工作的報酬，換言之，也便是工作人員本身勞力的代價。抗戰以前，因物價低落，生活安定，淸苦如小學敎師，亦可維持溫飽；現役軍人與公務人員，雖同工不同酬，然其生活均可維持，因此大多公敎人員武職人員，皆能安居樂業，從無哀怨之聲。自從抗戰發生，形勢日趨變化，物價高漲，負纍加重，一般收入顯已不足應付現實之需要。但在「勝利第一」旗幟之下，公敎人員抗戰軍人，爲了爭取抗戰勝利，爲了爭取民族生存，心安理得，毫無怨尤。今天，抗戰勝利卽屆兩年，物價指數超過四萬倍，而公教人員武戰人員，薪餉待遇仍在杯水之間，何以能使公敎人員生活安定，樂其所事？何以能使現役軍人精神振奮，士飽馬騰？與現實生活相形之下，公敎人員待遇，實在太不合理了。</p>
<p>不錯，志士不忘在溝壑，公教人員旣有其榮譽地位，應該忍苦耐勞，公而忘私，國而忘家，越　時會艱難，越當精勤惕勵，但是這些話，公敎人員以此自責則可，政府以此偏責公教人員則不可。生活是現實的，社會是憎惡的，今天的簡荐任官，遠不如銀行廝役，大學敎授差可與三輪車夫相比，現役軍人史形同乞丐，以致大多數公敎人員，因首喪面，侷促陋巷，成爲現代經濟社會中輕蔑嘲笑的對象，而公敎人員亦自視卑落，爭趨他途，對於國家民族的影響，實匪淺尠。政院當局正視了這個問題，積極謀公敎人員待遇之改善，並要做到武職人員同工同酬，這確是很覽明的措施，想全國公教人員必表示擁護。</p>
<p>說到待遇改善，首先便需要錢。現有國庫收支懸殊，財政困難萬分，政府全盤調整公敎人員待遇，並實行文武公職同酬，預算的增加必龐大，如果以通貨膨脹來救濟一切，不僅刺激物價，並且增强財政危機，所以我們切望政府當局、一面改善公敎人員待遇，一面要實行縮軍　政。現代化軍隊，是採行精兵主義，凡士氣低落戰力不旺的部隊，均應實施裁縮，或化兵爲工：地方保安部隊，以地方財力供養爲宜。言是我們所望於縮軍的。中央地方機關，學校組織編制，莫不龐大鋪張，形成臃腫現象，並目許多機關，疊床架屋，毫無效率，應該切實檢討，緊縮人事，節省開支。這是我們所　於簡政的。</p>
<p>總之，公敎人員待遇的改善，今天是必要的：文武職人員同工同酬，更能增强士氣，且爲公務員制度，創立了新的法則，是很合理的。不過我們要喚起政府的注意：以增加薪給而待遇調整，祇是一種消極的行政措施，並不能眞正解決公敎人員的生活問題，因爲物價上漲和生活費用增加的趨勢，公敎人員的收入難於適應，政府必須克服經濟危機，消滅物價上騰的因素，向經濟復興的合理化道路邁進，總能有實際上的裨益。</p>
<h3>美元恐慌的後果</h3>
<p>英國工黨執政兩年的結果，在經濟上不僅未能打開難關，而且仍陷於困境而不能良拔；使社會主義的當。試，又面臨一大考騐。英國工黨內閣，在艾德禮首相領導之下，這幾天來，正與美元恐慌鬥爭，連日與有關各部大臣會商今後所當採取的對策，俾使英國能安然渡過經濟的難關：英國議會也定於今天開會，計論如何應付缺少美元的恐慌問題。由此可知戰後英國經濟的困難情形了。</p>
<p>據美國聯合計的報導、英國近二十年來，經過十年的不景氣，六年艱苦的戰爭，二年工黨社會主義的嘗試，早已變成了一個悲慘的世界，在今日倫敦，街　巷尾，到處張貼着標語，警吿國人：『不做工，就要凍餒！』我們研究英國經濟困難的原因，一言以蔽之，乃在美元的缺少；英國人民日常生活所需要的物品，無一不發牛匱乏的理象，若要自美國輸入，則非用美元向美國購買不可。聞美國在戰後貨與英國的十億美元，至本年七月份爲止，已用去了七億美元、尙留三億美元；這區區之數，如何能足够英國的需要，實在是一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>英國前任首相邱吉爾，前天在牛津郡華特斯多克城，向聽衆五萬人發表演說，曾將英國經濟發生困難，完全歸罪於工黨政府。並謂工黨政府不知以美元購買工業設備，而完全浪費於奢侈品。邱吉爾的話，當不免有借題發揮的作用，企圖藉此攻擊工黨政府；但是有其演詞中，也有許多千眞萬確不可否認的事實，不僅使我們易於了解英國經濟困難情形；而且也可以使美國人民，尤其是美國商人，知道今後國際貿易的困難，方興未艾呢？</p>
<p>英國現正在那裏鬧着美元恐慌，注國也在那裏爲了美元將用罄而發愁；此在其他各國，亦莫不如此。美元恐慌，固然是各國經濟困難的主因，但是對美國而言，也是一種嚴重的經濟危機；美國如果不早日自覺，作遠大的計劃，救人救己：而仍斤斤於對各國出超是求，則美國將來終有一日，有了商品無法運出與他國通商，致使國內形成生產過剩的現象。所以世界各國發生美元恐慌的後果，是坡値得美國朝野密切注視的！</p>

<h3>埃總理向安理會要求　英軍應退出埃及　並結束英在蘇丹統治權</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：聯合國安理會今日開始討論英埃爭案，開會後，埃及總理諾克拉酋親自請求安理會命令所有英軍退出埃及與蘇丹，並結束英在蘇丹之現行政權，俾埃及可自英帝國主義束縛中獲得解放。埃總理指出英軍之繼續留於埃及，實爲中東東和平之「潛伏威脅」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：埃及出席安理會代表諾克拉莤今日向安理會提出警吿稱：在今日之世界上，再不能容忍帝國主義之存在，而置聯合國憲章於無睹。安理會應敦促英國結束其對尼羅河流域與蘇聯士運河之長期統治，不然埃及人民之憤柳情緒，勢將一發而不可收拾矣。諾氏要求安理會採取下列步驟：（一）英軍立則自尼羅河流域無條件完全撤退；（二）英國應停止對蘇丹實際上之統治，俾蘇丹可與埃及合併；（三）取消一九三六年之英埃倏約，因該約就埃及之觀點言之，實屬違背聯合國憲章，面將使英軍繼續留駐埃及九年故也。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五山廣播：英代表團發言人稱，如安理會大多數會員國代表不表反對，英代表賈德幹將就諾克拉莤所述各點，加以駁覆。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖五日電〕安理會主席宣布，理事會將於今日襟準時間十二時半（上海時間九時半）討論埃及問題。美方官員稱：美國將以公開態度，參與此事之討論，在英埃雙方表明其立塲前，美代表當不表明其態度，惟國務院數月以來已就此一問題，加以洋細研究。此間埃大使館人員對於美國之得在理事會中直可接支持埃及，表示樂觀，其理由乃爲埃總理上週訪問社魯門及馬歇爾時已獲有同情之表示。再就美國報紙之支持印尼觀，可見美國可能支持埃及。</p>
<h3>安理會討論希臘問題　蘇聯對案遭否决　希保邊境局勢突趨緊張</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖四日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯四日在安理會中指斥西方列强謀在政治及經濟上奴役希臘，側蘇聯推翻杜魯門主義之企圖，在表決時慘遭失敗。蘇聯提議安理會下令一切外藉軍事人員撤離希臘，將所有外國經濟援助置於聯合國監視之下，幷將最近希臘與阿·保·南·三國之最近糾紛歸咎於希臘政府。在表決時，僅有蘇聯及波蘭段投贊成票，安理會其他九國會員國均投反對票。葛氏在表決前指斥「若干國家」干涉希臘內政，幷謂此種干涉雖美其名曰「援助」，而其爲于涉則一。葛氏幷不提及美國或杜營門主義等名稱，但意義頗爲明顯。葛羅米柯復謂，蘇聯亦感覺希臘確需經濟援助，但同時認爲此項「援助」之目的，并非爲滿足希臘人民之需要，而僅爲滿足希臘之軍事上需要，遂使希臘內政混亂至此云。被蘭旋提出決議案，囑巴爾幹四國家採取措施，以恢復友誼，英代表賣德幹常斥爲可笑之建議、不啻承認安理會之無能，實有損而無益。</p>

<p>〔中央社安加拉四日電〕巴爾幹半島於過去的十八小時中，風雲緊急。據土耳其方面消息，保加利亞正調集大軍於希臘邊境。土耳其西部邊界地方自昨日起，即聞及隆隆砲聲，保軍砲轟之性質如何，尙待確定。希臘色雷斯方面之叛匪，於上週內迅速展開，刻已威脅希臘北部港口薩朗尼加。第一批美國軍火已於昨日運抵希臘，居於希臘東北部份之十萬土耳其人刻復返希臘，叛匪之騷據使土耳其政府至爲關切。目前關於土耳其將遺軍援助希臘政府　亂之揣測，甚囂塵上，據悉，土耳其此舉係得美國之鼓勵。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕美英兩國戰後之一魯爾爭奪戰」正進入新階段，擬於年底提高魯爾煤產三分之一，作爲對馬歇爾援歐計劃之一大買獻。目下蓋爾區每日產煤約廿二萬噸，僅及戰時產量之半。倫敦方面，貝文外長今夜向下議院重申英國對德國魯爾區煤礦與工廠收歸公有之旣定政策。貝文問曰：「此種工業不歸人民，將歸何人？將歸企業組合，或克虜伯公司乎？」貝文並表示反對法國所提四國管制魯爾計劃，據稱，「余不擬參加四國管制魯爾計劃，除非四國管制德國工業」。貝文述及德國工業水準時，主張德國鋼產提高至一千一百萬噸左右，以適合希特勒執政前及備戰前之德國生活標準。渠稱：吾國對德目標有二·一方面使德國安居樂業，同時，確保吾人之安全」。</p>
<h3>英美兩國刻正考慮　繼續减少駐歐軍隊　英軍擬立即自義希撤退</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕美英兩國正在考慮繼續减少歐洲方面佔領軍員額，以節省人力，而不在節省美金開支。華盛頓與柏林兩地已商定减少軍隊之各項臨時辦法，務使其不妨礙美國方針，不推翻西方佔領區與蘇聯佔領區間之均勢。美軍員額聞將减少一半以上。惟英總理艾德禮欲以减輕英國軍事負担，以挽救經濟危機，因乃溶入一種新因素。美國於此不得不繼續研究方能作最後決定。</p>
<p>美國陸軍當局原認爲德國四分五裂，國際關係混沌，蘇聯又遲遲不批准義大利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，匃牙利及芬蘭五國和約，則十五萬美軍駐紮歐洲，已不可再少。惟國內徵兵停止後，陸軍人力缺乏，陸軍部對此不得不重新檢討。英國在歐陸駐軍約三十五萬名，其中駐在德國者不足三十萬名，駐奧地利者約二萬八千名，駐義大利者二萬名，駐希臘者六萬名。艾德禮聲明駐德軍隊即將大事减少，駐在希臘及義大利之軍隊則擬立即撤退。義境英軍之撤退似使美方不安。</p>

<h3>為了密告獎金　四機關被控告　價值三百萬萬物資　指有隱匿盜賣嫌疑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關副總稅務司丁貴堂，江海關職員錢宗起，郭有容，前敵僞產業處理局長劉攻芸，前敵僞產業處理局查緝組長呂師尙，前敵僞產業處理局核　科長陳守之，中央信託局敵僞產業淸理處兼處長吳任滄等七人。頃爲孫竹亭·祝生堯·曹海深三人，向司法稱關控吿，對敵僞產業有隱匿盜賣嫌疑，總數估計約値三百億元之鉅。原訴狀略謂：本市鄧脫路三四〇號瑞昌五金號棧房內，上海淪陷期間，原係日人秘密倉庫，佔地約四畝面積，其中物資堆積如山。卅四年九月間，會由吿訴人向前軍品接收委員會密吿，其時該會負責敵僞產業接收者爲物資組長呂師尙，經吿訴人密吿後，該倉庫門前忽來大卡軍四輛，往返搬運物資。達三天之久．</p>
<p>此後軍品接收會撤消，敵僞產業處理局成立，呂繼任該局查緝組長，該倉庫即交與處理局，嗣又移交江海關。卅四年十二月十一日接收完畢，惟移交案卷中，查無此項先行車運三天之物資賬目，卅四年十二月月三日，江海關登報公開拍賣銑鐵管二萬六千餘條，（約計六十餘萬公斤），煤八，百餘噸，其他米，麥，五金材料不計其數，密吿人於柏賣後前往領取獎金。據江海關吿稱，只售去廢鐵四百噸，以前公吿之銑鐵管二萬六千餘條係屬筆誤，吿訴人當時即拒絕領受獎金，具呈向中央信託局敵產淸理處陳述，奉該處批示，略謂銑鐵二萬六千餘條係齊物浦路倉庫之物，與吿密人所稱之鄧脫路倉庫無關，告訴人以上列四機關有共同串通隱匿盜賣敵資罪嫌，聯名具狀地檢處請予澈查，聞地檢處將傳該案關係人偵訊。</p>

<h3>天津發生離奇命案　鬼市人頭內幕　單明舉心臟被挖　兇犯任立魁拘解法院訊辦</h3>
<p>〔本報天津訊〕天津半月來爲「人頭案」攪得漢城風雨，其中案情，經警局半月偵察，業巳水落石出，竟是一位無量籌老道性心理變態演成的慘煎，主犯在巳經解送天津地方法院訊辦。茲誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>一雙臟袋</p>
<p>津市西廣開靶當附近，素縣「兔市」，是黎明前後下層社會進行明路階路各項冀交易的塲所，就在這鬼市「出鬼」的時間，七月十四日的大鴻平，靶擋西胡同口發現了一個蘇袋，被人打開後，裏面滾出鮮血淋演的巨大人頭一顆，而肢體下落不明，人頭相當英俊，長髪被剪去一節。檢騐結果，右太陽穴及頭頂均有木棍傷，可以判定乃生前被擊斃後，用刀將頭割下拋棄者·於是鬼市人頭案，乃傳　全市。</p>
<p>警探出動</p>
<p>警局聞悉此亂奇命案後，先將人頭研究了一番，根據人頭頭髪被剪以及兩鬢甚長兩點，判斷死者是一個老道，準此，遂出動大批探警分向津市龍華學教會，道教聯合會，玉皇廟等三渚集團歲行跴查。探索三天，終於訪知死者姓名；單明舉，年二十八歲，山東泰安人，住址是天津趙家審大街開源里三號，係與另一老道任立魁（年四十六歲，淸河人）同住該處。嗣經進一步查詢，得悉闡明舉是北平白雲觀老道，身體高大，面貌淸秀，於兩月以前由平來津，原住趙家窰大街榮記店，衡與任立魁相熱，於伍月十二日由任勸至開源里同住，七月十三日晚，單明舉尚與相識者孫秀靜·李慶榮·袁吉星在開源里五號作雀戰，迄晨四時始散，距其頭顱被發現於鬼市，不過二三小時光景。</p>
<p>裝瘋作傻</p>
<p>警局根據偵查所得，十七日赴任單同住之開源里三號探查，發覺屋內磚似浮設，將磚掀起，則土質鬆動，血跡糢糊，墻上也發現斑斑血痕。床下有兩個花盆合在一起，其中長髪一綹，另有木棍一根，均滿染血漬，長髪與與鬼市人頭之髪無異。詢之任立魁，單調舉何在？答稱不知。問以何來血跡？據云：乃宰雞之血。又稱：乃單明舉與人毆鬥時出血，而矢口否認殺人，屍體仍無下落。警局將任立魁扣押後，任於警察分局竟裝瘋作假，停食閉氣，拒絕作供，一　度使警局頗感棘手。</p>
<p>地下掘屍</p>
<p>經三日間之偵訊誘供結果，任立魁方說出單明舉確係被其所殺，肢體埋於其居室西北負門後水缸下，廿九日警局派員前往掘屍，果然在二尺深的地下發現單明舉的缺頭屍體，全身以舊棉花包裏，用舊電綫及蔴繩綑綁，上身赤裸，着由汗褲。據檢騐，屍體背後胸前及左臂，均有木棍傷，胞前有刀口一處，長六寸五，寬三寸，肚陽流出，心臟已被挖去，騐及下體，則發現生殖器亦己張割表。審訊任立魁殺人動機，任堅不吐供，仍復作法閉一飛，信口胡扯，案情內幕，仍在悶胡蘆中，無法查明。</p>
<p>女性脾氣</p>
<p>直到廿六日，案情方始大白。據警局從旁偵訊結果，任立魁原來是一位性心理變態之「龍陽君」，即自己假充女性實行同性相交者是也。據一度與任立魁同住之王文淸稱：〔去春曾由友人介紹與任立魁合住一屋，搬進去以後，發現任立魁脾氣頗具女性，曾數度用言語向我挑逗，那時，他在家替我做飯服侍我，但不准我回家，常因此；角，有一次並將菜刀擲給我，讓我把他剁死，直到今年正月二十九日，我趁他「祭星」十二夭屋內不許有別人的時侯才乘機搬走。」</p>
<p>動了妬火</p>
<p>根據以供詞，始判知任與單之必有一段性生活關係，不料單固風流道士，吃喝嫖賭，無所不爲，且常深夜不歸，以致惹動任立魁嫉妬之火，而將其殺死。這由任立魁之割挖單明舉心臟及生殖器可以窺知，但任立魁對此點尚未眾認。</p>
<p>任立魁何必將人頭拋之魁市呢？這可以從任立魁殺人前對人說的話裏尋出答案，他會說：「人死後，鬼是跟着頭走的。」他顯然希望那鬼不要在他的屋裏作崇，所以棄之於鬼市。（記者李紹林·八·三·）</p>

<h3>土工程師在鄭州　發掘小礦井　大學生自愧經驗不足</h3>
<p>〔本報鄭州訊〕豫西谷地小規模煤礦頗多開發。鞏好有十個以上礦廠，每驗有有三五個礦井年產六百萬噸。禹縣有五十三個礦并，年產一百萬噸。其他密縣，登封，　縣，氾水等縣，也都有大量的煤出產。這些小規模礦井，多半是經十工程師勘定後開採的。那些士工程師也不知道什麼是礦苗，也不知道用什麼儀器去去測量，只是憑其經驗，看看這一地事是否四面環山，山上長些什麼樹木，山間的溪流怎樣走着，然後用其步戈，代替測量議器，斷定某一所在有煤無煤。如有，還能說出掘多深可以見煤，是什慶樣得煤。據說還有所謂瓜田煤，即是在這煤田之下，一個一個煤堆像散在田上的瓜一樣，那土工程師也能指出從那一點掘下去，正是可以掘入瓜心，那末在二三年中這一個廠單靠這一個瓜就能發跡。——</p>
<p>有個則從大學畢業讀完礦科去年去到密縣看礦，說是發現了煤礦，省政府劉主主很高興，化了二億元，還從重慶借來了鑽礦機，結果鑽到二十丈深，還不見煤。旁邊一個土程師看到說：「你在書本裏讀到這地方有煤，我却在地上看下去不知道有煤」。最後那個大學生只得廢然而退放棄了繼續開採的念頭。</p>
<p>七月十二日夜十二時，伊陽有個碳　發生慘案，一百多個礦工被活埋在井裏，幷上還死了四個礦工，傷了三十七個，原因是礦井突然爆陷。平日不注意安全設備的礦井，很容易出這種亂子。省政府派有駐礦人員，征收所得稅，希望能多派幾個人，或者巡迥視察的，多多注意安全設備與礦工福利。（記者范世勤·八·二）</p>

<h3>杭立武昨由平抵滬　談平津教育觀感　定今日返京不久來滬整理交大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敎育部次長杭立武，於上月底由京飛平，作復員後第一次之視察平津院校，頃已公畢，於昨日下午飛返抵滬，定於今日返京，行前將與交通大學校務整理委員會各委員有所商談。記者昨晚往訪於其客邸，杭氏滿面風塵，足徵此行辛勞。據談此行視察結果稱：「淸華」「燕京」兩校，現已漸次恢復戰前原狀。「北大」在胡適校長領導下，已有迅速之發展，希望政府在經費方面述予設法，配合該校旣有之人力物力，以適應其發展。平津方面，「北洋」在艱難困苦中奮鬥，刻亦漸吿復原。「南開」因張伯苓校長之領一導，及該　苦幹快幹之精神，大致已復舊觀。就一般院校情形言，設備均感不够，敎職員宿舍缺乏，最爲嚴重。平津敎授希望與京滬敎授相同，享受配給待遇（米，麥，煤等），杭氏已允於返京後設法，冀得早日解決。目前各校均有外國學生就讀，國際學者來華’亦多願前往北平一遊。就全國各地現狀比較言，北平仍不失爲我國敎育文化之中心，今後更負有推進國際文化之責任。渠相信各校圖書儀器充實，敎授待遇提高，生活安定後，短期內即可恢復戰前四五年之大學黃金時代。學生方面，因平津接近戰區，情緒激昂，生活嚴肅，今年投考學生，大有增加。至此，記者就暨大解聘敎授招待記者報吿事件請詢，杭氏稱：在平津各校絕無類似事件發生，因各校均有委員會之設置，敎授之是否續聘，全視其敎學成續及學術水準而定，由委員會全體委員開會決定，校長個人不能任意去留。此在北大，淸華，燕京，已成爲一極優良之傳統制度。暨大事件，杭氏稱：以敎育部立塲言之，自應採取信任校長態度，未便過問。</p>

<p>華嚴甲勝錦園（男一）</p>
<p>華嚴甲前排汪均炳，每賴錢家祥之供給猛殺，翁誠光亦然，但錦園挽救得法，一度成五比七，反較華嚴多二分，相互肉博，華嚴甲以十一比九先獲易位之權，此後形勢一變，華嚴突飛猛晋，第一局廿一比十三結束，梁爲義之發球，亦得力不少。</p>
<p>第二局錦園先發球，頗呈生氣，一再成平手，但華嚴甲又漸以一二分居前，本局爲二十一比十四。</p>

<h3>當日支票不能抵現　工商業影響較著　銀行公會建議折中辦法　提供保證准予當日抵用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃爲財部查飭金融界票據當日扺用事，特徵詢本市金融界某權威意見。承談：票據尙未收到，而予以當日抵用融通一事，在票據法上，本無根據。就銀錢業實務上言，亦非範圍內之業務。故取締票據當日抵用一事，在金融界，並無所謂。惟於一般工商界賣金之週轉，不無影響。查目前因通貨膨服關係，貨款收解支付，動亂億萬。票據殆爲唯一之支付工具。且因利用票據當日抵用之關係，金融界無形中予工商界以先一日資金週轉之便利。今如貿然取締，工商界必大感不便。當日票據如欲抵用，票款勢須隔夜籌齊存入。本以當日票據抵用者茲須用大批現鈔替代必致造成現鈔短絀之象。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據悉：本市銀行商業同業公會，爲减少因票據當日不能抵用所引起之不便計，特向當局建議執中辦法，對客戶以票據當日抵用者，着出立保證書，在抵用款項之額度內，予以償款之確切保證，該項建議，尙有待財政當局作最後之核定云。</p>
<p>又據四行二局方面意見，站在國家行局之立塲而言，爲避免空頭支票起見，確不能抵用，四行二局非但現在不抵用，即在過去亦不抵用。若當日支票可以抵用，無異增加通貨膨脹，商業銀行則爲欲求存款之增加，故對當日支票，大多通融抵用。實際上欲求銀錢業本身業務穩定，及限制通貨膨脹起見，對當日支票確應禁止抵用云。</p>
<p>又據全國銀聯會某負責人談：此舉實爲鞏因商業信用之原旨，今後票據交換所退票數字，或可因之而减少。</p>
<h3>賣風籠罩市場　華股迂迴下游</h3>
<p>華股昨多頭除二三五號外，餘者幾全部出籠，銀根見緊，買方屏障已失，三二號等並有翻空活動，於是自晨迄午，始終在賣風籠單下，屈服倒底，中途抵抗微弱，臨收各熱股一致以低價結束。</p>
<p>晨開即見不振，遞永紗開低不少，開後復經六〇號九一號一五三號一六〇號四號，九七號一五七號一五二號七六號三二號賣出，盤跌至二三七元，二一八號一〇六號一七八號趁低有納而略盤。三二號一五二號二二四號一〇三號六〇號二一二號一五四號二二三號紛售，八九號並力售現永紗，迫低至二二九元及二二三元　十時後，一五八號八五號九五號二一九號二一八號趁勢來進，亦不過拉上二元而已。四五號一九七號二三一號三二號一六二號紛售，六七號紛售現永紗。十時四十五分後，遞永紗亦破入二三〇元內，一六號二二四號九七號一六二號一六九號一八六號一　四二號均有賣出，二〇二號一七七號一九〇號紛售現永紗，午後遞永紗跌至二二五元而後稍回，現永紗則以二二二元低價結束。一四一號供給新光後，籌碼見鬆，亦以低價結束。</p>
<p>收後遞永紗喊價先抵後高，初會低至二二四元，後以二二七元結束。結果較前收計即交股永紗華豐新光跌一成光景，美亞景福信和永公勤興中法各挫半成强，新華低半成弱，水泥統益中紡大通微挫，景綸成交少，跌落一成半，麗安中絲跌一成左右，火柴跌半成强，內衣獨平。遞交股計永紗美亞新光景福跌一成光景，信和跌半成强，塲外各老股除大生外，概見平疲。</p>
<h3>一五二號　暫令停業</h3>
<p>第一五二號經紀人吳國英，昨由證交通告略謂：未經呈准在華山路一號設立分號，其違背交易所法部份，歸法院處置，在法院未判決前，應令暫停營業，自八月六日起至二十六日止三星期云。</p>
<h3>統債外股挫跌</h3>
<p>公債昨雜牌尙平，統丙則多方繼續了結而續疲，五五五室雖進，二三〇室三六〇室則出，自一〇九〇〇元開後，高價一一四〇〇元低至一〇三五〇元而後稍穩。結果較前收計甲乙丁戊各跌一〇〇元，統丙跌落六〇〇元，成交約五百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨亦不支而竭，物資與匯水又復助賣，各股疲態益顯。怡紗自九萬元開後，形成供過於求，步降至八萬五低價結束。猶太商對鋼業紙業仍具買胃，證券帮先進後出，銀行帮亦供，洋行帮亦扒，廣帮則臨收力售。結果較前收計會德豐微降，英聯業廣怡啤各挫一成左右，怡紗鋼業則跌一成强，餘股均降半成左右。</p>

<h3>現棉沉寂</h3>

<h3>棉織業產銷聯營　向紡建洽配原料</h3>
<p>上海棉織界鑒於以往日貨在南洋暢銷，且有悠久歷史，一旦日本對外貿易開放，日貨運銷南洋，恢復固有地位，自不待言，爲鞏固該地我國市塲計，前曾由該業領袖徐文照傳良駿發起，聯合襯衫汗衫襪子手帕毛巾被單服裝等業，親設棉織業產銷聯營公司，其初步計劃擬以機子廿萬打，汗衫十五萬打，毛巾廿五萬打，被單一萬打，襯衫二萬打，及手帕十四萬打，運銷荷屬東印度及菲律濱一帶，以爭取外匯，而拓展我國國貨市塲。據佔計以上成品所需十六支廿支卅二支四十支及四十二支紗北約三·六一〇件，工繳約三四八億元，成品照當初市價佔値，計六九二億元，可値三百五十萬美元。該公司爲原料及工繳無着，曾具呈全國經濟委員會，要求有關機構撥付，原則業經全經委會於上月十二日舉行例會通過在案，並轉囑紡調會及四聯總處核辦。該公司現爲積極開展生產計，昨由負現人爲原料供應問題，向紡建公司常局洽商，據悉：紡建公司對其原則極表贊同，一俟該公司組織成熟後，再續商供應細則云。</p>
<h3>大批日本紗布　過滬運往南洋　總數五千餘噸計二萬餘件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕荷輪芝沙丹尼號，上月底經滬駛神戶，前日（三日）由日復來上海，轉道厦門。香港·新加坡等地返回泗水。本市乘客一百八十餘人，貨運僅行李箱四只。惟由神戶奘載有棉紗棉布共五千餘噸，計二萬餘件，爲數頗爲可觀。此係日本在南洋市塲動態之一，據進出口商稱：我國因禁止紗布運銷外洋，故無法經營云。</p>
<p>紗市清談</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉紗市况，晨開即露疲態，蓋因津粵等帮實銷不動，絕少採辦，將近收時，散多頗有吐售，塲上籌碼充斥，市氣更形不支。結果四二支藍鳳細紗，比上日回跌三十五萬，爲一千六百九十萬元。二十支特雙馬一千二百三十萬，輕雙馬一千零四十萬元，齊降四十五萬元。其餘卅支大女金城人鐘，十六支三明紅蜂等，十支金寳星及四二支水月四十支吉象寳光等粗細紗，一致續挫二三萬至四五十萬元不等。</p>
<p>棉布閒散</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉布市况，開時業中人意欲拉提，終因散戶及染廠頻加吐售，並聞紡建公司對四君子金印元嗶嘰有十萬疋現貨陸續供售，又粵漢客帮因與該地市面倒懸，辦胃不動，本街門市銷路亦淸，實銷絕無進展市氣頓吿頹唐。迨至最後，十二磅龍頭細布低至四十二萬六千元，比上日繼跌六千元。五福彩球藍鷄等細布，亦均續挫二三千至五六千元，其餘白坯漂布細布及嗶嘰藍布士林布等市，亦毫無精彩。</p>
<p>又訊：中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售四一五五疋，申購單共一三七張。內廠商三戶，購布二五五疋，布號一三四張，購布三九〇〇疋。開出布疋廿四種，內十二B字細布三十七萬元，四君子金印元嗶嘰四十六萬六千元，較前跌六千元。一定如意漂布五十萬元平定，水月漂布三十七萬五千元，較前跌五千元，跳鯉漂布四十四萬二千元，較前跌三千元，無牌41g廿布四十八萬八千元，獨漲八千元，其他各價均一相彷，申請者不甚踴躍。</p>

<p>（一）川省春絲收購問題，議決另交收購小組會研究。（二）本年春絲，已交到者達六百包以上。（三）暹羅泰記公司向我請購生絲一千包，出價每磅美金四元四角，設計會望提高至五元成交，請與繼續洽商。（四）四川江浙谷省本年秋繭貸款，是否續辦案。緣秋繭貸款，估計須達一千三百億元，連綠工貸款在內，德額須達二千億元。惟佔計外銷後，僅能換回外匯約六百億元，耗損太鉅，擬請呈財部，是否允予負担此項虧損。議決：待呈財部後決定。（五）春絲收購價格問題，內定收購價，每担爲二千九百萬包。惟詳情尙待提交協導會研討後決定。</p>
<h3>絲織業向當局呼籲　要求增加人絲配額　並請仰抵配售價以利生產</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局於八月四日恢復配售人造絲，照各廠商申請量核配半數，並調整配價，杭州·蘇州·盛澤等地絲織商聞訊，紛紛推派代表來滬，會同本市商人於昨午赴中央信託局請願，要求增加配額，並抑低配價。當由購料易貨處經理何墨林接見，商洽未獲結果。</p>
<p>下午三十餘代表又往社會局訪謁吳局長，申述目前絲織業之困難，如不獲解決，各廠將次第被迫停工，十萬餘員工勢將隨之失業。吳局長對此甚爲關懷，垂詢絲織業現狀甚詳，並即致電國行張總裁，約定於當晚七時往訪，籌商妥善辦法，日內對此問題即可獲有決定。</p>
<p>據第四區絲織工業同業公會常務理事劉慶一吿記者稱：絲織業係以人造絲及廠絲爲原料，勝利後人造絲由中信局獨家自日本裝運來滬配予各廠，其配價低於市價，本年六月份時每箱爲九百六十萬元，中信局之成本則不滿四百萬元。然自六月後即吿停配，至今已一月餘。滬杭蘇盛各地三百餘絲織廠，即因原料缺乏及外銷困難，多祇局部開工，境况甚爲惶澹。滬市絲織廠因而有工資折扣發給之議，迄今尙在勞資評斷委員會調處中。今中信局自四日起恢復配售，但配價提高至每箱二千二百六十萬元。黑市價爲二千四百六十萬元，但配貨號先一星期付款，如以拆息計算，則配售價已與黑市價相平。蘇杭各地商人聞訊頗爲震驚，紛紛來滬籌商要求抑低配價，否則無法維持，祗有趨於關廠一途。至於配額，去年十二月時滬市共爲二千九百箱，至本年六月减至四百餘箱，不够分配，故要求增加配額</p>
<p>又訊：人造絲昨市價無多大變化，交易甚爲淸淡。昨市一二〇號高山有光二千五百萬元開盤，中午收盤價爲五百二十萬元，下午因配售貨昨未配出，持貨者尙圖掙扎，收市好起二十萬元，爲五百四十萬元，比上日大四十萬元。廠經昨市甚靜，各級高司度均乏做開，但因籌碼枯竭，喊價均提高五十萬元之譜。綢貨，眞絲被面，開市即降，華强貨先喊一千〇五十四五萬元，最後做五十三萬元。大誠貨最高做五十八萬元即期價，收市爲五十五萬元。格子璧縐成交極稀，喊價與上日相仿。盛貨冲電力紡及洋紡等產地報漲，前者大一萬元，後者三千元至五千元。</p>
<h3>絲織業貸欵　四聯核定標準　每台貸五百萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四聯總處前准第四區絲織工業同業公會請求，對該業本年度貸款，依織機每台貸款一千五百萬元爲準。茲經該處審核一過，已決定以每台織機，核貸五百萬元爲準。估計該會所屬會員織機台數，在六千台以上。以每台五百萬元計，則貸款總額，將達三百億元以上。聞該會會員廠，去年獲得生產貸款者頗多。本年申請新貸款前，須先了結舊貸款一應手續云。</p>
<h3>食米重入疲境</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧六千石左右，店方納胃轉懈，市况重入疲境，粳秈米均見回降三五千至萬元，形勢乍升乍降，不脫盤旋之局。白陰元依然堅定，浦東新粳北市今日亦有到貨，回小三五千元。</p>
<p>麵粉微升千元，洋粉續漲三四千元，麩皮胃呆，微挫三五百元。</p>
<p>豆餅仍趨下游，脩削二一千元，營口餅再跌五六千元。黃豆陳貨似覺牢硬，暗暗見緊，新貨則各路均有，依然平正。</p>
<p>葉豆交淡少神，赤豆站平之狀，莞豆俏利，元麥活靈，紅糧去化香燥，價形帶挺。</p>
<p>苞米北洋猛吸，搜購甚烈，再見新高價，續漲萬元，已達二十萬大關，蠶豆客帮續辦，暫成穩定之象。芝蔴軟化，生仁南洋消化活躍，扶搖直上，繼續飛升一二萬元。小麥廠方進意不濃，明定暗疲之格。</p>
<p>油市廣帮續辦，市勢活潑，生油　昂二三萬元，豆油步漲一二萬元，淸油亦加一二萬元，蔴油續見挺進三三萬元，菜油跟漲萬元。</p>
<p>緬甸洋米　定期運滬</p>
<p>我國前由國際糧食緊急處理委員會核准，本月份中得在緬甸採購食米一〇·五三二公噸，暹羅七·六八〇公噸，九月份之預定數量爲緬甸一六·五〇三公噸，暹羅六·四〇二公噸。中央信託局經已接獲糧食部知照，着手佈置船隻，準備分批奘運來華。茲悉：該局昨已向國營招商局洽定海天輪由加爾各答駛往緬甸，先裝六千噸，預料該輪可能於本月十五日啓程來滬。</p>
<p>至本月份麵粉配量，前亦經核准，得在美國境內價購八六四〇公噸，該局購料處負責人爲外匯頭寸調度事宜，曾與國行張總裁數度接洽，業經就緒，不日亦可裝運來華。</p>
<h3>食糧上落不多</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢穩定，微有上落。公會劃盤，二〇中砂白五十六萬五千元，升五千元，台赤五十六七萬元，四半白六十六萬元，汕提靑四十三萬元，計五十餘包。海南赤百餘包，四十三萬元，興化白袋莊貨六十一萬四千元，簍莊五十七八萬元。興赤高四十三四萬元，次之四十一萬元，計百數十包。刁靑三十四萬五千元至三十四萬元，僅四五十包交易</p>
<p>冰糖配價</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕台糖公司即將配售之冰糖，業經本市物價評議會第八次評議小組議定配售價格爲每市担八十五萬元，（包括代收社會福利事業基金三萬元），批發價每市祖一百零二萬元，自即日起實行。</p>
<h3>本市工業團體組織　對日經濟研究會　檢討對日貿易政策</h3>
<p>本市各國貨團體，爲應付開放中日貿易。於昨午假聚豐園召開對日經濟研究委員會，計到機聯會，國貨工廠聯合會，中國工業協會，國貨產銷協會，生產促進會等各體團代表胡伯翔，程年彭，田和卿，潘士浩，金潤痒等數十人。決定成立對日經濟研究委員會，俾以民間工業家成立對日經濟研究委員會，俾以民間工業家立塲，檢討對日貿易政策。幷決定推派代表於六日晚（即今晚）搭乘夜車晋京，向中樞各當局提出三項意見，（一）開放日本貿易詳細品目，請政府准許人民參加討論。（二）赴日商務考察團代表人選，應公正廉明，幷須聲明放棄對日貿易，三對日基本國策，須遵守經濟研究會參加意見。據胡伯翔稱，同人等決將於六日晚晋京請願，向中樞常局對中日貿易問題，切陳利害關係，希望政府能予採納，則國計民生，均將受益匪淺。又此次各工業團體代表晋京，同時幷將向向行政院，財政部，經濟部等各機關首長申訴對於輸入限額工業原料部份，要求直接配予工業家，除向中樞申訴外，幷提出六項建議云。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>法律釋疑　外貨傾銷工廠倒閉　清理債務發生糾紛</p>
<p>編輯先生：某甲於去年一月集資開設工廠一所，始則營業尙佳，最近因受外貨影響，負債停閉，並將一部份生財標售償債。友人某乙曾數度貸款與甲。約定以機器生財。房屋作抵，又某丙會於去年十一月間，向甲租賃廠房全部，定期二年，按月租金言明以出品提成。又丁某執有該廠退票及棧單，自該廠倒閉後即向法院起訴。請問（一）某乙押款未淸，本可自由處置廠產，因知該廠已租與丙某。現知丁已先來執行，估價拍賣，應如何對付？（二）丙係去年十一月間，向田租賃，但未向法院認證，此租約是否生效？（丁）某已執行拍賣，丙是否可以申請異議，對租貨權有否影響？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）押款未淸，非『可自由處置』，抵押權如經合法設定，則『抵押權本不因抵押物價之所有人將該物讓與他人而受影響、其追及權之行使，自亦不因抵押物係由法院拍賣而有差異，故抵押物由普通債權人聲請法院拍賣後，抵押權人未就賣得價金請求淸償，亦僅喪失此次求償之機會，而其抵押權旣未消滅，自得對於拍定人行使追及權』。（二）租賃契約，未向法院認證，亦生效。（三）所有穩讓與第三人，其租賃契約對於受讓人仍繼續存在，丁執行拍賣，對丙之組貸權不生影響</p>

<h3>英維多利亞朝　桂冠詩人但尼生</h3>
<p>— 羅蘭子</p>
<p>英國維多利亞朝的文藝，顯然地與伊利莎白朝，一樣地處在天下太平的時代，民主作風的抬頭，工業革命的成就，使浪漫主義的文藝，漸漸引入了寫實主義的新潮。</p>
<p>在維多利亞朝，最有成就的詩人莫過於愛爾福來特。但尼生（Alfred　Tennyson），他的詩，差不多有五十多年，爲英國人民到處你誦，正如莎士比亞的戲劇一般；因爲他能把人民的聲音寫到了詩歌裏，他的詩句，成爲有力地人民底歡樂與疾苦，正如議員在議會上代表人民說話一樣，而其力量勝過百倍。他的詩，兼有了斯賓塞，密而敦，華　華斯，雪萊，濟慈，司卡脫，拜倫等的所長！是維多利亞朝文人的代表。</p>
<p>但尼生生於一八〇九年八月六日，英國林肯郡的「瑣美慈悲」敎區長的住所裏，那兒的天然環境，便早孵育了這位詩人的靈感。但尼生十二歲時便開始寫詩，後來和他哥哥一齊進了劍橋大學的三一學院，二年級時著了頂比克太詩，異常精采，得了一個榮譽獎牌。</p>
<p>一八三〇年夏天，他和哈蘭（Hallan）受科倫影響，也跑到意大利革命黨中去活動！在比利牛斯山中行軍，以反抗意皇。</p>
<p>一八三一年但尼生父親死了，家境窮困，不能再在大學內求得學位，家居六年專心研究學問，空時寫詩。</p>
<p>一八三二年秋，他的摯友哈蘭暴死，但尼生灰心一切，十年中很少寫作，但他爲輓哈蘭而作的「悼念詩」，（In　Memorlam）與他的「君王的俚歌」齊名於世。</p>
<p>一八四二年他的詩集（Poems）公諸於世，近代故事詩也附印在內，出版後轟動了　衆，詩名大起。</p>
<p>一八四七年出版了一篇三千行長詩「公主」，膾炙人口。</p>
<p>一八五〇年他被舉爲「桂冠詩人」，繼續華茲華斯的尊號。本年他和哈闌的妹妹，那愛慕了十三年的女郎塞爾塢（Emily　Sellwood）結婚。後來他得維多利亞女皇的寵召獎賞。一八六四年他著了「愛那期，亞登」聲名譽愈盛。</p>
<p>一八七二年後他嘗試戲曲，用以說明英國在建國時的艱難，鼓勵人民的愛國心。他寫出了「瑪利皇后」，「哈羅」，「　　」，「酒杯」，「五月的希望」「白克開脫」」山林居民」等劇本，自然，不及他寫詩爲純熟，造詣並不及莎士比亞。</p>
<p>一八九二年十月六日，病逝於他的隱居之所，十二日，公葬</p>
<p>但尼生作品的作風，是爲人民代言的，他的詩歌簡潔而有力，而且具有精神哲學的意味，他和同時代的詩人勃朗寗的作風正相反，永遠活在大多數的人民心中。</p>
<h3>提琴聖手的幽默</h3>
<p>— 秋萍</p>
<p>空前絕後的小提琴聖手帕格尼尼（N．Pagamini），他雇了一輛馬車去演奏。那車夫向他要加倍的錢，帕氏問什麼理由要加倍？那車夫說：『你的演奏爲什麼比別人要多一倍錢呢？」帕氏說：『我能把四根絃剪斷了二根演奏。你能把輪子拆去一半嗎？」</p>
<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 李蔚初</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>現在，我學會了沉默，心在沉默裏哭泣，嘴唇因沉默而緊閉，雙睛因沉默而　視，無言的言語使我深深的了解了深沉的意味。我想我永遠都不要說話了，假如話是庸俗的，自私的，殘忍的，失掉了語言的可貴的；假如因話而招來反感，禍患，陷害，那我不如永遠閉上了嘴，啞吧是聽慧的。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>多少次的，我恨我的眞誠！</p>
<p>當謊言比眞實　美麗的時候，</p>
<p>當虛假比眞實都甜蜜的時候，</p>
<p>我爲我自己的愚蠢，傻瓜，而傷心，甚至，羞愧而哭泣。這時候，我就恨我自己！恨我也爲什麼不會說謊？恨我也爲什麼不會虛假？道時候，我就加倍的詛咒我自己！</p>
<p>三多少次的，我更埋怨我自己：爲什麼你不能忍？爲什麼你不能自欺也欺人？那明明不關你的事情，你爲什要與人分辯得臉紅？那煤球明明是黑的，人家却說那是白的；你爲什不能够承認？</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>那人明明是備夫，你却認爲英雄；那人明明是一位沽名鈞譽的好好先生，你却認爲慷慨仗義的騎士；那人明明是一點佈施，你却還去了萬斛深情；那人明明是閒情逸致，你却用上了綿綿的一生的愛情；你戴上了什麼眼鏡呵？你的雙睛被高尙蒙閉了嗎？你的心靈被聖潔欺騙了嗎？五年，十年，水潮去了，石頭露出了，於是；你知道錯了，你後悔，惱恨，可是，那有什麼用？一切都被錯誤冲激走了，你還是詛咒自己的愚蠶吧！</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>風呵雨呵，在窗外敲打，呼號，哭泣，夜比死還靜，蛙聲像無盡的哭訴似的，風不是也帶着宇宙的哭訴向人間嗎？在這種時　，這種情境裏；心靈遇到了夜的沉沉的寗靜，彷彿受過了悲哀的洗禮，因此就淸凉如水，就明鏡一樣的淸楚了，這時候，有一點瑕疵也不能饒恕你自己了！可欽敬的，唯有智戀和理智，情感只是一個十七八歲的昏頭昏雖然天眞　的小孩，甜蜜得可愛，但是幼稚愚蠢得可笑，你如果懂得秋高氣爽的秋的深靜和遠致，同時你假如回想一下在春天裏你所闖下的禍，你就會明白了，在還裏，人是不歡迎眞正的春天的，因此凡屬於春天的一切；天眞，熱情，直爽，人性的眞實的洗露，這時候，是不受人們所歡迎的，而且被目爲愚蠢，幼稚，可笑……</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>——那麼，什麼時候是春天被歡迎的時候呢？什麼時候，是人類表現整個眞的時候呢？</p>
<p>我不知道，可是我們的心是知道的，我們的心不是同樣的如此要求過嗎？當你心上這個聲音再起的時候，你就會知道這個時候一定不遠了，而且她離你們也不會太遠了，那時候你就會相信人類不是趨向毀滅，而是向光，向快樂，向明善，如同從夜向天明。</p>
<h3>戀情</h3>
<p>— 徐銘懷</p>
<p>記取那逝去的如水的年華，記取那昔日的如夢的戀情，憶念的潮汐迂縈地流過心河，　色的琴音在心底絃上奏起……</p>
<p>記曾小立橋畔，凝眸淸澈的沙水，倒影着蔚藍的晴天，乳白的雲片，菁菁淺草的凝碧，姍姍蘆葦的顫動；細波，經微地絮語，又脈脈地奔流着前去。</p>
<p>生命永遠是這麼匆忙的嗎！人生永遠是這麼恬適寗靜的嗎？</p>
<p>回答的是一串朝霞似的嫣笑</p>
<p>一叮咚」！滑落一片碎石，衝破澄靜的水天，漣漪是孄醉人的酒渦呵，漾起，漾起。</p>
<p>祗是人生過程中小小的浪花呵，還有數不淸的浪花，大的，大大的，小的……在未來的日子裏。</p>
<p>記曾蹀　郊原，浴着金色的光波，晚風底舞衣溫婉地拂過；聽一片蛙鳴，伴着悄然而來又悄然遠去的風底歌唱，看碧空冉冉的行雲，和悠然靜臥的遠山，歆動的情緒裏，抽出一絲絲遐想的游絲，飄送到遼遠的地方——這該是超現實的享受，無比的享受。</p>
<p>到綠楊樹下做一個綠色的夢去吧！覓取那「夢中的愛情」，愛情的溫馨，溫馨的長靑。</p>
<p>記曾深坐樓頭，聽沙沙細雨，輕襲屋瓦，簷漏開始它抑揚的彈奏，由輕而重，由徐而疾。</p>
<p>挑亮紅豆般的油燈，顧視室內元然肅穆的周遭，有着無盡的相思的滋味跟繾綣的溫情。偎倚着，讀哲人底詩篇，作鐵細的囈語，聆取呼吸均勻地起伏，脈搏輕輕地跳動，心電默默地交流。讓無邊的夜進行着吧！世界上已不復有孄我存在。</p>
<p>記曾盪槳湖心，湖上的燈火，徘徊在蒼茫的夜霧裏，惺忪地眨眼，一絲絲弦月的光，柔和地篩落湖面，繁星在漣漪裏微笑，發亮的麟波上，游艇俏皮地吻過，耳畔響起淸朗如歌聲：</p>
<p>眼波流</p>
<p>半帶羞</p>
<p>花樣的妖</p>
<p>柳樣的柔</p>
<p>無限的創痛</p>
<p>在心頭</p>
<p>輕盈的一笑</p>
<p>忘我憂……</p>
<p>槳聲伴着歌聲，歌聲和着槳聲，歌聲，槳聲，震盪着夜凉如水的湖上，震盪着夜凉如水的月夜，是一支旋律優美，音調鏗鏘的交響曲呵，是一串縹緲寫遠的美麗的春夢呵。</p>
<p>記不淸的良辰，數不淸的夢境，唱不完的樂曲，詩篇，咏不盡的詩情，戀情呵！</p>
<p>戀情是一杯橙色的醉酒呵，散發着馥郁的芬芳；戀情是一顆姣小玲瓏的蓓蕾呵，孕育着無限的生幾意；是雨後譎麗的彩虹，掛過長空；是「驚蟄」前第一聲春雷，掠過層雲；是繚繞在心頭的樂曲，是色澤繽紛的畫面，是心的歡笑，靑春的交流呵！</p>
<p>珍惜歡笑，珍惜靑春，莫敎狡猾的步伐盜　　寳貴的年華，　讓輩色的琴音滑落　熾熱的戀情，　心中的意蕊，在金色的日子裏，綻開一朵緋色的小花。</p>
<h3>乳燕</h3>
<p>— 閔子</p>
<p>遠在春天的時候，燕子披上一襲紫褐色的璀燦的外衣，從海洋的彼岸來了。</p>
<p>它們說着輕快的言語，在樑間，用自己的口沫和着泥草，築起了一個溫暖的窠。似乎沒有聽到它們說過情話，這一對遠來的情侶不知在什麼時候產下了卵，又不知在什麼時候孵出了乳燕。乳燕們把嫩黃色的嘴巴擱在窠邊上，那樣吱吱地叫着。</p>
<p>老燕似乎不再有停在樑間那樣舒快地歌唱的餘暇了，它們把自己的神力都安放在年靑的一代身上，它們飛向田野，捕捉着蜻蜓蝴蝶一類的小蟲飼養着自己的孩子。看到父親或是母親啣着東西回來，乳燕們張大了黃色的嘴巴，吱吱地喧噪了。</p>
<p>留在窠邊的老燕，那樣細心地看護着自己的孩子，唯恐從樑間竄來的蛇和耗子們會把它們攫走。有時候，老燕用自己的嘴巴啄去黏在乳燕身上的泥土和枯車，或是梳理着它們尙未豐滿的羽毛……多麼細膩的體貼與崇高的愛呵！</p>
<p>為着生命的延續，它們繁殖着自己的後代，爲着要培植後代，它們嘔盡了自己的心血！</p>
<p>如今，乳燕的羽毛在辛勤的哺育下豐滿了。它們能跟着老燕飛翔於澄碧的晴空，而且又學會了捕捉飛蟲。於是老燕重又在樑間呢喃了。這是欣慰的歌唱，它們的心血已經獲得了珍貴的酬報</p>
<p>秋天來，它們回南方去了，老燕因爲神力的衰竭，在遠涉重洋的時候給巨浪吞噬了。飛回去的祗有那些青力壯的孩子們。</p>
<p>老燕的命運固然可悲，但從那些比自己更茁壯的後一代的身上，可以找到最大的安慰。</p>

<h3>「貴陽橋」</h3>
<p>— 呂連</p>
<p>這橋的顏色眞新鮮，是大紅色。紅得像火，又像血。站立橋頭的人，有幾個是不斷腸底歡笑客？這眞巧妙。塗飾這橋的人一定有不少底經歷，見過不少靑草鮮花。這名字怎麼也起得這麼特殊？在東南底熟鬧都會中起個貴州省內一個城市底名稱。這有點怪，也許對岸是陰間吧，說不了，世上的神秘事好多。那麼不管怎麼着可不要走過，人應該謹愼的好。且在這橋上站站，歇歇，無人作伴，有雲，有水，也不算孤獨寂寞。橋上有樹。怎麼，橋上有樹我不信。啊，是長在岸上底樹不規矩。這怎麼講？它底一枝從橋欄杆穿過來了，懂吧？提起攔杆，欄杆也有點奇怪，這不是木頭，木頭不會這樣細，那麼這是鉛絲？也不大像。望望周圍吧，眼睛不能儘頓到面前。周圍儘是樹。樹，樹，全是樹。有草，草太蕪亂，這是何人主管的地方，這樣沒規矩。咦，怎麼右側還有條虹，不，說錯了，是紅，一條紅綫。不大也不小，像橋不是橋，這究竟是什麼地方？去看看，能增廣眼的機會絕對不能錯過。別往前走，貴陽橋對岸你怎麼敢保證它不是陰間？右側，右側，退回去一樣走到。…啊，仍然是橋。橋名仍是貴陽橋。頭頂上多幾種小鳥，小鳥倒自在，唱得多高興啊。旅伴在剛才所立的橋呌我了。討厭，自己走得慢，還要剝削別人走橋的時間，問問他：貴陽橋爲什麼呌貴陽？『不知道」，好乾脆，這種爽直我不喜歡，掃別人底興頭，出自己底洋相，不如免開尊口。怎麼啦，催着趕路？好好，抬抬腿就撇下十里路，要是不看貴陽橋的面子跟你賭氣。</p>
<h3>悲多芬的窮與死</h3>
<p>— 東方蒙霧</p>
<p>一八二六年十一月末旬，悲多芬患了一種腦膜炎感冒，在維也納病倒了。一連病了好幾月，動了好幾回手術後，錢便用光。他只得在三月初（一八二七年）寫信給倫敦的音樂社以及在英國的糜塞爾斯，請他們盡力設法組織一個援助他的音樂會。那音樂社慨然立刻先寄給他一百金鎊，作爲預支的款項。他對這件事情非常的感激涕零。「這是一回摧心的景象，」一個當時在旁看到的朋友說、『看見他，接到這封信，合着他的手掌，並目因喜悅和感激而呻吟。」在感激中，他的傷口再度裂開了。而且他還想口授一封誌謝的信，給那些『高貴的英國人，他們同情我的悽慘的命運」；他答應給他們寫一個作品：第十交響樂，或一篇序曲，聽他們的便。『我永遠沒有，』他說：『帶着如許的，從事一個作品，像我寫這個作品的。」這封信是三月十八日寫的，可是在同月二十六日，一塲下雪的暴風雨下，我們的一代「樂聖」却死去了。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>可是，也有一件小事，叫他不能無恨。您知這，耀羣給地買過一雙新皮鞋；這皮鞋經　　給他檢定，當然不會錯，皮色黃鬆鬆地，放着毫光；跟外國鬼子和中國大學生穿的，一模一樣；一點也不少什麼；此外，小老虎雖然參加正式軍隊，但並不限制軍官打扮，所以耀羣還給弄了一身軍服，一頂軍帽，還有一個金先晃的普通領章、因耀　想到他有時或需參加宴會，或集團出塲等等，小老虎不能不有一身行頭。另外，當然還有一分鼓勵的用意在內。這一套行李，在這「衣錦榮歸」的演出上，要是實地全身披掛起來，見了媽，見了六伯，見了外叔祖，和寨裏許多畏輩平輩和底下人，面上何等光彩？偏生在北平駐軍撤退的那一天，耀羣就把這套漂亮行頭給藏了起來，只留下一雙皮鞋。</p>
<p>這次回老寨，雖說隨身有那張「通行證」作護身符，但沿路九關十八卡，隨時可以碰到翻箱貫的逮檢查行動；所以兩人只穿着原來隨身那一套，和幾件換洗衣服，打在兩件小包袱裏，連那僅僅穿過一兩次的新皮鞋，因與衣着不稱，却扔在北平了。這一點，僅僅只有這一點，叫小老虎感到大大的美中不足，每一想起，總得咬一回牙，瞪一回眼。但一想到自己已經做了「小隊畏」，又想到此行的秘密使命，也就把這條心事扔過一邊了。</p>
<p>車到潘陽，照耀羣的理想，以爲必有很多麻煩，所以預先叮囑過小老虎很多的話，要他特別謹愼，小心，忍耐，不能多說一句話，最好一句話也不必說；這是害怕生出麻煩，躭誤了正事。誰知車子一進站，二人都感覺到有一些特別；不像以前的情景，頭一點就是冷靜，出奇的冷靜。通常一下車就有各種怪聲吆喝，下車的人，就得應聲在月台上排班，檢查隨身行李，盤問來踪去跡，檢查「越境證」，「身份證」，「通行證」，「防疫證」，「保護證」，……如稍有疑問，吃大耳巴子之外，還得取保。</p>
<p>這回，二人下車，各人手裏一個小包裏，早把各種證件，放在手頭。誰知月台上淸淸靜靜並無排班這回事，也沒有人來盤查；下車就可出站，站口只有收票員，和兩個路警，執行收票職務。此外什麼麻煩都沒有。這眞出乎二人意想之外。</p>
<p>耀　覺得這事可怪，却無法打聽；也沒有這種　情去惹這是非。只一出站，略一閃眼，四面掃射了一下子，就上了一部接客汽車，說了一個地名。</p>
<p>這時才午後七點多鍾。平日，照這車所經過的這幾條街道，這時候雖不十分熟鬧，倒也人來人往，川流不息；可是耀羣與小老虎坐在車子裏，就不大看見有人行走。沿街的店舖，有的已經把門掩上了，有的正在忙着關門。這個情景，照耀羣看來，好像一個謎。小老虎當然也看到這一點，幾次想說什麼，却被　羣止住了。</p>
<p>到了指定地點，一家旅舍門前，剛一停車，就見一個招待模樣的人，搶步下了台階，迎了過來。悶了三十多個小時的小老虎，這時有些想活動了。他笑着舉起手來，對那迎過來的人，打了一個熱　的手式。來人一見，有幾分吃驚似的，只微微點了點頭。</p>
<h3>請踴躍輸欵</h3>
<p>— 台生</p>
<p>再為殉難報人家屬呼籲</p>
<p>本刊曾刊載王點先生代朱惺公遺族呼籲一文後，承家麟貸學金董事會慨捐一百萬元，並請本報發起爲抗戰殉難報人，募集捐款，優予撫卹。</p>
<p>自本報揭載此項捐款啓事後，各方捐款甚爲踴躍，可見社會對於忠烈報人遺族，均願懷慨輸將。</p>
<p>敵僞時期上海報人與敵僞鬥爭的情形，不是身歷其境的人，是很難想像於萬一的。那時候，敵僞偵騎四出，各報館週圍，爆炸時起，手溜彈，硫磺彈，彈片火燄迸飛，「七十六號」暴徒潛伏報社左右，伺機襲擊報人。當時報人生命，其危險情形，與前錢作戰並無二致。</p>
<p>但是飽含着戰鬥，硬朗，不屈不　的「紙彈」，依然義薄雲天，忠膽照人地射向無恥卑鄙的敵僞，使他們知道上海雖然成爲孤島，但正義的旗幟，依然飄翔於上海的市空；國軍雖然西撤，但以「筆桿」代「槍桿」的上海報人，仍率領着全上海市民，在保衛着祖國！</p>
<p>朱懼公，張似旭，程振章，李駿英，金華亭，邵虛白……，以及其他殉難報人，爲着捍衛　國，爲着發揚正氣，他們倒在祖國的旌旗之下，倒在絢爛榮譽的血泊裏……。他們的忠烈，逗人熟淚；他們的英勇，可爲報人楷模。</p>
<p>勝利業已二年，但是殉難報人遺族的生活，却並無保障。愛護祖國，愛護報人的上海市民，希望能够踴躍輪將，務期集腋成裘，分贈殉難報人家屬，以慰諸烈士在天之　。</p>

<h3>美國來書</h3>
<p>— 正明譯</p>
<p>美國目前對於魏德邁赴華使節團的任何討論，雖多少猶帶猜測性質，但情形已經顯得很確定，華盛頓的當權者們決定將以援助給予蔣委員長，而魏德邁的來華之行，據傳顯然是來發掘某種可以作爲「修正」美國政策之基礎的證據的。國務院的見解如能稱之爲見解的話—是這樣的：在馬歇爾回國並親自呈交關於中國「兩方均受譴責」的報吿以後，杜魯門如不經過另一個「調查事實」使節團的種種活動，似不能名正言順的修改政策，雖然誰也不相信魏德邁能對國務院接自在華各種人員的報吿與分析，能增加些任何東西上去。</p>
<p>魏德邁將朝鮮包括在他旅行日記內的計劃，一個國務院的大亨，對我說這只是「一種參考」，而且並無重大意義。</p>
<p>援助朝鮮計話已告擱置</p>
<p>在此事公佈之前，國務院將先行聲明—如果目前種種計劃上，能吿成熟的話，他們今年無論如何不會要求國會批准對朝鮮實行任何援助。據說他們的文吿中將向朝鮮解釋，他們已經決定在下屆國會會議中，將朝鮮併入全世界經濟援助的整個計劃中去。而國會開會之期，除非杜魯門在本年秋季召集一次特別會議。大槪要在明年正丹才能舉行，給朝鮮人吃一顆外包糖衣的苦藥丸。</p>
<p>援助朝鮮計劃，所以被放棄，其理由是這樣的：</p>
<p>共和黨國會領袖們，在最後一分鐘吿訴國務院官員們說，他們今年內絕無希望可以獲得七千八百萬美元來援助朝鮮。參議員范登堡已經坦率拒絕，不答應經由他的參議員國外關係委員會來宣佈這個方策，機會國外關係委員會主席埃頓（Eaton），對國務院說他願意提出此案來討論，但是必須在一九四七年本屆大會上不能對此案有所行動，因爲國會議員們一般地已經對這個援助外國的論題，弄得胆戰心驚了，喬依馬丁（Joe　Martin）對國務院說的也一樣。陸軍部撥助朝鮮「內政機能」的一億三千七百萬美元的款額，將包括若干復興經費在內，但數額不會太多，因爲大部份是要充佔領費和糧食救濟金的。</p>
<p>美國袒護日本</p>
<p>因爲日本是美國想扶起這個舊敵人化錢最多的地方，所以美國顯然正以最辛苦的努力，而且是當作最先的要事，在推動日本的經濟復興。不論正確與否，大多數的美國官員，現在也均已抱着英國人的那種老觀點，認爲日本人是在東方能與做好生意的唯一人民。此外，目前正有人希望，在遠東建立某種反蘇堡壘，而日本人恰正處於要害地點上，可以做美國人暫時的最大寵兒。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯已經表示擬抵制八月內的日本和約預備會議，全世界淸楚看到一種絕望的僵局最後已無法避免。目前華盛頓的信心是，美國不論有無蘇聯參加，必將堅持領導舉行對日和會，因爲如果讓步，必將被人說成是某種退却，而馬歇爾已經說過，他必不採取此種退却的。</p>
<p>痛悼印尼戰爭</p>
<p>國務院每夜在虔誠地蓄可憐的印度西尼亞人和越南的維明政府做禱吿，但看不出能有幹些任何有效騐事情來的樣了。今天他們正在對荷蘭重新發動，進攻印度尼西亞人的戰爭表示痛心，但明天也許會發出一篇奇妙可笑的小通吿，對衝突爆發表　「遺憾」，然而此外也就別無動作了。</p>
<p>荷蘭曾在戰時協定條件下獲得物資，而當時所獲的租借物資，現在正用來同印度西尼亞人打仗，美國實有重新收回的理由。然而華盛頓的官吏們却說，美國如想運田收回權，必將造成太多的麻煩。爲了我們美國的金錢起見，這樣來試一下似乎並無害處，而且我們應該向荷蘭提出通知，非待他們確實知道他們正生活於二十世紀內，我們決不再以進出口銀行的貸款或其他金融援助給予他們。對於在越南的法國人，亦應同樣處理。</p>
<h3>觀音得道</h3>
<p>— 魯氏</p>
<p>陰曆六月十九日是佛敎聖日觀音得道，由於傳說編上了戲劇，大香山的演出，遂有人深信觀音大士是妙莊王的第三位女兒，同時因爲菴寺所塑又普遍是女像，更證實了大上是女身成佛。</p>
<p>其實，佛敎的義理，四大皆空，本無一切相，何來男女分，至於塑造女像，以及妙莊王一段神話，則是一種象徵而不是事實</p>
<p>當初佛祖釋迦牟尼，生於印度中古黑暗時代，目擊那時魔刦重重，對人生觀極端悲哀，寗願放棄王儲的尊貴，入山求道，想超出世界之外，救拔自己，後來大澈大悟，明瞭出世救己，猶是小我，於　立志入世救人，完成大我，所謂出世救己，即是如來，入世救人，乃是大士、換句話說，如來以消極虛空爲最高理想，觀音以慈航　　爲神聖使命。</p>
<p>佛法廣大無邊，隨緣種因，隨聲證果，所以說佛有千億化身，妙色身如來，是佛祖化身之一，妙字拆成少女，少女心最慈悲，因此大士以少女來作爲象徵，白衣昭示純潔，紫竹代表靈通紫竹靈山觀世音，即是佛祖，佛祖即是妙莊王，三位一體，並無所谓父女關係。</p>
<p>善男信女們，但敎宅心慈悲，發揚你們的博愛精神，把握你們的純潔信念，咫尺即是西天。方寸自有極樂，何必名山朝聖，纔是修行啊！</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>任何國家都有牠的與衆不同的風俗人情。英美兩國人屬於同一血統，可是生活習慣有時迥乎不同到令人難於置信。即以服裝一項而言，就有極大的區別，英國人喜歡穿短袴子，美國人絕對不穿短西裝褲，你踏遍美利堅，找不到一個穿短袴而大担在馬路上行走的人。他們對於穿短袴的人有一種極猥褻的解釋，因此從英國或印度去美國的人，祇好把短西裝袴珍藏起來，免得被人取笑。雖在盛夏，儘管短袖襯衫，一條袴子總是長脚管的。女性在夏季所穿的衣服，簡直單薄得令人不信，比較累贅的則穿長袴網襯衫，進一步則穿短白嗶嘰袴，宛如中國舊式的兜肚，有的索性祇穿乳罩與三角袴連成一件的東西，那種富於誘惑性的服裝，在南部各省最爲通行，在紐約等大城市則較爲少見。美國小姐在夏天幾乎全不穿襪子，一來尼龍襪子不易買到，二來穿了襪子對於健美毫無增益，所以襪子商店到了夏天，簡直門可羅雀，聰明的出口商打聽得中國小姐有穿襪癖，而且肯出最高代價，於是以每雙一元的代價，搜購所有尼龍襪偸運到上海來重價脫售，那種絲襪以大尺寸者爲多，適合美國女人的使用，勉强着在中國小姐細小的腿部，總覺得不甚相宜，美國女性有喜歡戴花的癖好，因爲不容易買到鮮花，便用紙花點綴，紐約的女性，尤其戴得濃艷，宛如旗人的宮裝，一個個的髮部裝堆得像四郎探母裏的鐵鏡公主。（三六）</p>
<h3>新幣應該甚麼？</h3>
<p>— 余靜</p>
<p>發行「孫幣」的傳說由來已經很久了，却始終未見成爲事實。有關常局更屢次聲明並無其事，可是這絕不會是空穴來風。經過這次戰爭，通貨膨脹得有如鳶鳥高翔，難於控制，整理貨幣自是勢在必行，只不過時機尙未成熟，常局愼重將事，不願先期招致不良影響罷了。最近魏德邁將軍來華，傳聞將協助我國整理財政，改革幣制，半官方更透露有在年內實行可能，這可見得爲期總不在遠了吧！</p>
<p>新幣將叫什麼名稱呢？這是一個頗富興味的問題，而一定爲許多人所關懷，茶餘酒後資爲談助的。倘使新幣的名稱果眞是傳說中的「孫幣」的話，那麼政府爲了崇德報功，提醒國民緬懷國父領導革命先烈艱難開國的豐功偉業起見，採用國父的姓氏作爲新幣的名稱，原本立意良佳，無可訾讓；不過，我們倘使能使得新幣的名稱裏含有更多的意義，更切合實際一些，總還是可取的吧！</p>
<p>如果我們能詳細地知道世界各國貨幣名稱的來源，一定是極富趣味的事，有的只不是由淳樸的鄕村方言演變而來，有的深富神話的意味，自然也有用帝王或是偉人的姓名的，並無一定的規律。可是在不規律之中，却有一新的命名法則，値得我們的借鏡；即是從國家的名稱演變出本位貨幣的名稱來，這樣在國際間流通起來，也許比較意義深遠莊重吧。</p>
<p>稍爲留心一點國際常識的人，大概都知道玻利維亞（Bolivia）的貨幣是叫玻利伐（Boliva）的，立陶宛（Lithaunia）和拉脫維亞（Larva）沒有加入蘇聯之前，他們的貨幣也分別叫做立特（Lit）和拉特（Lat）的，也許有人以爲這些都是小國家，不足爲法。但大家總該不會忘記法蘭西共和國（Frabce）的貨幣叫做法郎（France）的一回事。他們都是將國名的尾巴摘去了或是稍稍改變而來的，似乎給人的印象很明確莊重。</p>
<p>在英文裏，中國叫做China，法文裏叫Chine，日本叫我們做支那，都是從秦Chin音變而來的，可見兩千多年前，秦朝的典章制度武功帝業已足以爲寰宇各國所推崇尊重了。倘使我建議我們的新貨幣本位定名做　（China），大概還足以說明中華古邦的泱泱大國風度而無恭於四強之一的尊稱吧！</p>
<p>他明白地吿訴握有他的人，這是一枚中國（China）的貨幣，並且「金」字的邊旁也吿訴人他是萬能的金錢，也表明了他是採取的金本位。我想我國整理幣制之後採用金本位制，已是無庸置疑的事了。</p>
<p>「鎭」是一個新字，祗不過是出於我的杜撰，但我以爲現在一切均日新月異，已不是康熙字典所能解釋一切的時代了。</p>
<h3>蘇聯的原子城（下）</h3>
<p>— 彬之譯</p>
<p>——唐努烏梁海——</p>
<p>唐努烏梁海已成爲蘇聯的秘密窟了。但從報車，雜誌和政府的公報中，字裏行間，可以發現一點機密。在這塊廣大的漠野中、本來只有着七萬多人，渦着游牧的生活。但麥斯維托夫在蘇聯評論中所說：那裏蘇聯人激增，土人也漸漸地蘇聯化了，再從潑來錫迪姆的文字中，那裏已漸漸地電氣化了。全境劃分鴛十七個電化區和四個城市，用常識來判斷，　游牧的草原上，不會有這樣許多村莊的。這說明人口增加的迅速，也許蘇聯人已超過了土人的數量。</p>
<p>另有一段文字，說起唐努烏梁海的河流瑚泊，經過多年的疏濬工作，汽船已可在那裏往返了。這不免要問，汽船和濱河的機器是怎樣運送的呢？當然不外水陸兩途。若用陸路運送的，那說明蘇聯的鐵路建築，已秘密地擴展到他的膓地。若是水運的，那證明葉尼塞河的通航，已經成功了。再從科學家的調查口誌中，看到汽車往來的頻繁，那表示在唐努烏梁海的公路，也是四通八達。</p>
<p>唐努烏梁海的農業發展情形，雖無從探悉。但在一千五百萬英畝面積的土地種植榖類，並沒有許多工人。推想出那裏，定和蘇聯旁的地方一樣，採用大規模的機械耕種。同時利用煤和水力，將電力站相吻合。</p>
<p>蘇聯政府對於唐努烏梁海是十分地重視，耗費了無數的金錢和人力來開發與建設。在一九四六年，至少有卅二所大規模的研究所在那裏成立，還有五個科學考察團從事　產的調查。假設蘇聯有原子城的話，一定在唐努烏梁海。</p>
<p>從　簡斷片中，得到一錢半爪的資料、勉强畫出蘇聯原子城——唐努烏梁海——的大槪。但再要多曉得一點，就沒有辦法了，除非蘇聯揭開了他那神秘的幃帳。</p>
<p>水滸駢枝</p>
<h3>保正</h3>
<p>— 愛竹</p>
<p>托塔天王晁蓋是以保正著稱的，保正不消說相當於現在的保長。宋朝在先沿襲前代，鄕間分置里正。常里正一定要賠錢，最苦的一項差使是輸流到地方衙門裏去服務，名曰衙前。後來把　一項差使免去，改由鄕戶充當，里正只管催納賦稅，於是苦了鄕間的一些富農，里正倒不算苦差了。到神宗時王安石行了免役法，改差爲募，人民負擔了一筆免役錢，理應不再服役。可是行了保甲法以後，保正却代替了原先里正所負的職務，王安石的打算在省錢，保甲的職務愈重，玫府所雇的各役就可以减少。所以當時保正就負有淸查戶口，逐捕盜賊，催納租稅，訓練壯丁等責任。一到南宋這種情形愈來愈甚，各種職務堆積在保正身上。例如送迎宮府，修橋，補路，發送公文等，除此以外上役要納一筆見面錢，罷役要納一筆罷役錢，困苦不下於宋初的里正。</p>
<p>照水滸傳上所述晁蓋的情形，似乎他在鄕間頗有聲有勢，才做了保正。那一定是北宋的情形，若在南宋，較有錢勢的人是不會充當這苦差的，尤其像晁蓋那樣交遊廣闊的土豪，所以這一端也顯見是北宋傳流下來的故事。</p>

<h3>Guidance Committee on Trade with Japan Composed of Representatives from Seven Agencies; Business Delegation to Postpone Trip to the East</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The organizational measures for the Business Delegation to Japan were submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion and approval on the 5th. The selection of personnel was also put forward for discussion, but because further opinions from various parties were still needed, a final decision was not made. The original plan to depart before the 15th is now impossible to achieve. The organizational measures for the delegation stipulate that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will establish a "Guidance Committee on Trade with Japan," composed of one representative each from the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Transportation, the Resources Commission, the National Economic Commission, the Central Trust Bureau, and other relevant units. This committee will be responsible for guiding all matters related to trade with Japan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] The Executive Yuan discussed today the establishment of a Guidance Committee composed of representatives from seven agencies to handle trade issues with Japan. The committee, under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, will exercise supreme authority over private trade between China and Japan. It is reported that the committee will pay attention to ensuring that companies or individuals trading with Japan do not violate the three principles passed by the State Council: that trade with Japan must not affect the private economy of the Chinese people, that reparations goods from Japan must not be included in the list of permitted imports from Japan, and that the government and business community should jointly organize a delegation to Japan for investigation before formally resuming trade with Japan.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Distributing Compensation Goods Requested by Four Countries Approved by MacArthur</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] The Reparations Section of the Allied Headquarters announced that the list of machine tools to be distributed to each country requesting compensation will not be finalized before October. Therefore, the distribution of the 30% of Japanese pre-reparations goods is unlikely to begin until October or November at the earliest. However, the Reparations Section, with the assistance of the Eleven-Nation Reparations Technical Advisory Committee, has made some minor progress. It is understood that the procedures for distributing pre-reparations goods to the four countries requesting compensation—China, France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands—have been approved by MacArthur. China, which will receive 15% of the pre-reparations goods, will be allocated the first set of tools. The second set will be divided into three equal parts, each accounting for 5% of the assets, to be distributed by lot among France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. After the list of tools to be distributed to each country requesting compensation is finalized (around October), each country can review it and submit its requests for the equipment it actually needs. The transfer of reparations goods can only proceed after the above procedures are completed. The initial 30% of reparations goods, including machine tools and secondary metal casting machinery, are all dismantled from the former Japanese Army and Navy arsenals. Tools from privately-owned munitions factories and aircraft factories are not included in this partial distribution.</p>

<h3>American and Canadian Ambassadors Return to Nanjing from Jinan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] American Ambassador Stuart, and Canadian Ambassador Davis, concluded their pleasant trip to Jinan on the 5th and returned to Nanjing at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Taibao, Jinan, 5th] The American and Canadian Ambassadors, bid farewell amidst a warm send-off by Wang Yaowu and representatives from all sectors at 3:40 PM on the 5th and flew back to Nanjing. Before his departure, Stuart Leighton attended a symposium with representatives from all sectors of Shandong. The representatives pointed out that the problem of China is not only a domestic war, but that there are indeed international conspirators secretly orchestrating it. The suffering and misery of a large number of students and refugees fleeing from the communist areas, the destruction of rural industrial and mining areas, and the small amount of relief supplies allocated to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have caused deep regret among the people. The ambassador said that he could not comment on international relations, but that what the American government and people want to do is exactly what the Chinese people most hope for. The basic spirit of the United States is to help the government supported by the people of any country. There is no problem with the principle of the policy towards China, only with how to help China without increasing or prolonging the civil war, and that helping China is not helping any one faction. He hoped that the Chinese government could reform its policies, gain the support of the people in the communist areas, and automatically serve the government. If the central government, local governments, and the people work together, there will be no problem with American assistance.</p>
<h3>President Too Busy with Official Duties, No Time to Visit the Philippines at Present</h3>

The President expressed his deep regret that he could not accept the invitation due to his busy official duties, but expressed his hope that he would have the opportunity to visit the Philippines in the future.</p>

<h3>Councilors Hold Social Gathering to Discuss US Far East Policy, Will Submit Memorandum to Special Envoy Wedemeyer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Telegram] The National参政会, a representative of public opinion organizations, is paying close attention to Special Envoy Wedemeyer's visit to China. At 3 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, it held a special gathering of参议 members to express their opinions on the current US Far East policy, the purpose of Special Envoy Wei's visit to China and the understanding of his mission, and our expectations for the US. 参议 members from the three parties expressed their opinions enthusiastically. The gathering on the 5th was presided over by Xu Xiaoyan, and more than 30 people attended, including Zhang Qianhua, Jin Weixi, Jin Zhichao, Qian, Zhang Weizhen, and Da Pusheng. The opinions expressed by the参议 members will be sorted out and submitted to the Foreign Affairs Group of the驻委会 for discussion and supplemented and revised before being submitted to Special Envoy Wei in the form of a memorandum. Qiu Changwei said: The US should be responsible for the current disputes over the CCP issue. The US should stand on a neutral position and recognize that the CCP issue cannot be resolved peacefully. The government has now entered the stage of armed suppression. If there is foreign aid, we will be very welcome, but we should still be self-reliant. Lu Yunzhang said: There are errors in the US policy toward China. Special Envoy Wei should understand the CCP's massacre of compatriots and the suffering of the people. China needs assistance, which is for world peace. If China cannot be peaceful, world peace is impossible. Wu Jingxu said: We should express our attitude to Special Envoy Wei to explain China's view of the world, because foreigners can hardly fully understand China. Zhao Yunfeng said: We should explain to Special Envoy Wei in a fair manner that China absolutely needs peaceful unification, and that it is inseparable from world peace. At the same time, we should explain to Special Envoy Wei the fact that the CCP is hindering China's peaceful unification. Yin Shuxian said: Special Envoy Wei should attach importance to the opinions of representatives of public opinion organizations, and should not be biased towards the opinions of party representatives, and hoped that Special Envoy Wei would face up to the expansion of forces in the Far East that threaten world peace, and hoped that the US would provide assistance. Zhang Qianhua said: There are two major opposing groups in the world, namely the US and the Soviet Union. The policy adopted by the US is that Europe is more important than Asia, and Japan is more important than China. We believe that the US should first re-examine its policy, and its attitude towards China should also be re-determined. At the same time, it should respect the existence of China's democracy and independence and help shorten China's war. This is not only beneficial to China, but also beneficial to the world. Luo Mengce emphasized the need for US aid to China, and said that China is a country that needs revolution but has failed in revolution. At present, China should be able to embark on the path of revolution in a moderate way, refreshing politics and economics, producing a strong government, and embarking on the path of moderate socialism. Huang Jianzhong said: The error of the US Far East policy really started when Roosevelt signed the Yalta Secret Agreement. He hoped that the US Far East policy in the future could face up to the harm of the communist forces in Asia. For the sake of world stability, the US should provide assistance to China. Zou Luowen emphasized that China should strive for construction to benefit China and the world.</p>

They presented a letter to President Chiang, putting forward eight suggestions: (1) According to the law, the party's nomination means that the party directly nominates, without the need for voters to propose it again; (2) If party members run for election on their own, it will inevitably disperse the party's strength and cause the party to split; (3) The selection of loyal cadres should be nominated by the party; (4) Party nomination is the norm for British and American parties; (5) It is advocated that the full list of candidates should be completely selected by the central government and sent to the lower-level party departments for proposal in accordance with the law; (6) It must be decided as soon as possible so that the candidates can go to their respective electoral districts to campaign; (7) After the list of candidates is determined, the central government should inform the local party departments at all levels to give absolute support and restrict the candidacy of party members who have not been nominated, otherwise they will be expelled from the party; (8) Election funds should be rationally distributed by the party and one-fourth should be raised by the candidates themselves.</p>

<h3>Autumn Harvest in Northern Jiangsu Flood Area Hopeless, Wang Maogong Appeals for Disaster Relief, Provincial Government Asks Executive Yuan and UNRRA to Send Planes to Survey</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Telegram] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, told reporters when meeting with them on the 5th to discuss the situation in Jiangsu Province, that he was deeply concerned about the flood in northern Jiangsu and hoped that all parties would be able to give more assistance to rescue the thousands of victims in northern Jiangsu from the mud and water. Wang pointed out with great sorrow that Jiangsu Province has had many disasters over the years. Northern Jiangsu began to report stability last year, but recently it has heard of floods again. It can be said that it has suffered many disasters. The cause of this flood was due to the flooding of the Yi River and the Shu River. More than 20 counties in Xuhaihuai were flooded, with more than 10 million mu of disaster-stricken areas and more than one million victims. In this area, the autumn harvest is hopeless, which is a major worry. The Huang and Huai Rivers are now continuing to rise. If they continue to flood, the 36 counties in northern Jiangsu will become foreign countries. It is really unthinkable if we do not seek to rescue them urgently. Before the flood, the provincial government had already prepared a rescue plan and asked the central government to allocate 5.7 billion yuan for emergency relief. Recently, Construction Director Dong Zanyao was dispatched to Xuzhou, and the provincial government has asked the Executive Yuan and UNRRA to send planes to the disaster area to survey the actual situation in order to prepare for rescue. For the US relief work, in addition to asking the central government for assistance, Jiangsu Province itself is doing its best, but it still hopes that other provinces will provide more assistance.</p>

(2) If all the land owned by grain households cannot be cultivated, permission will be granted to apply for investigation and give appropriate exemption. (3) If the landlord has land but no grain, or has more land and less grain, strict measures should be formulated to order them to report themselves and impose endowment. If they do not report themselves, once discovered, they should be levied at the full amount and the reduction and exemption measures should not be applied.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Suining Area Local Public Grain, Provincial Government Allows Counties to Retain for Local Use</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Zhenjiang News] 30% of the local public grain levied in each county in the Suijing District in the 35th year, half of which was given to the province. It was previously approved by the Finance and Food Department to be retained by the county for local use. Recently, according to the instructions of the Executive Yuan, the province and county should still each have half to make up for the provincial finance. After receiving the order, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, on the basis that the case had previously been notified to be retained by the county for local use, seemed difficult to comply with the change, and the finances of the counties in the Suijing District were very difficult, and the levied public grain would be supplemented. Therefore, it was decided at the 123rd meeting of the Provincial Government to maintain the original plan, exempt from the release of the province, and report to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Regarding the case of the American soldiers throwing our air force soldier into the water and drowning him outside Guanghua Gate, according to a spokesman for the U.S. military advisory group, the perpetrators may be formally charged on the 6th.

<h3>Editorial: Improving the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants</h3>
<p>"Improving the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants" is currently the most urgent and critical issue. The Executive Yuan has conducted multiple discussions in recent months, but no decision has been reached, causing public school teachers and civil servants to be restless and uneasy. However, it is reported that the Executive Yuan's Budget Review Committee concluded its meeting on the 4th and decided to adjust the salaries and benefits of civil and military officials and teachers across the board starting in August. It was also decided that civil and military officials would receive equal treatment. However, the specific increase and its base number are still being determined, and the final approval will be made at the political affairs meeting on the 12th. From this, it can be seen that the government attaches importance to this issue. The reason why it has been reluctant to make a hasty decision in recent months is to avoid being careless. This time, the Budget Review Committee decided to make a comprehensive adjustment and implement equal treatment for civil and military personnel, which is a valuable principle and of great significance. We only hope that the government will quickly enact the legislation.</p>
<p>The so-called treatment refers to the remuneration that public and private organizations provide to all personnel for their work. In other words, it is the price of the workers' own labor. Before the War of Resistance, due to low prices and stable living conditions, even elementary school teachers who lived frugally could maintain a basic standard of living. Although active-duty soldiers and civil servants did not receive equal pay for equal work, their livelihoods could be maintained. Therefore, most public school teachers, civil servants, and military personnel were able to live and work in peace and contentment, and there were no complaints. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the situation has changed dramatically, prices have soared, and the burden has increased. The general income has obviously been insufficient to meet the needs of reality. However, under the banner of "Victory First," public school teachers, civil servants, and soldiers in the War of Resistance, in order to win the War of Resistance and strive for national survival, felt at ease and had no complaints. Today, it has been almost two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the price index has exceeded 40,000 times, while the salaries and benefits of public school teachers, civil servants, and military personnel are still at meager levels. How can we enable public school teachers to live stable lives and enjoy their work? How can we inspire active-duty soldiers and ensure that their morale is high and their horses are well-fed? In contrast to real life, the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants is really unreasonable.</p>
<p>It is true that men of high ideals should not forget their responsibilities even in adversity, and public school teachers and civil servants, given their honored position, should endure hardship and be selfless, forgetting their families for the sake of the country. The more difficult times are, the more diligent and vigilant they should be. However, while public school teachers and civil servants can use these words to admonish themselves, the government should not use them to unilaterally blame public school teachers and civil servants. Life is realistic, and society is harsh. Today's junior and senior officials are far inferior to bank clerks, university professors are barely comparable to rickshaw pullers, and active-duty soldiers are virtually beggars. As a result, most public school teachers and civil servants are impoverished and live in cramped alleys, becoming objects of contempt and ridicule in modern economic society. Public school teachers and civil servants also see themselves as inferior and compete to seek other paths, which has a profound impact on the country and the nation. The authorities of the Executive Yuan have recognized this problem and are actively seeking to improve the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants, and to achieve equal pay for equal work for military personnel. This is indeed a very forward-looking measure, and we believe that public school teachers and civil servants across the country will support it.</p>
<p>Speaking of improving treatment, the first thing that is needed is money. There is a large disparity between the existing national treasury's revenue and expenditure, and the finances are extremely difficult. The government's comprehensive adjustment of the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants and the implementation of equal pay for equal work for civil and military officials will inevitably lead to a huge increase in the budget. If we use inflation to solve everything, it will not only stimulate prices but also increase the financial crisis. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the government will improve the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants on the one hand and implement military and administrative streamlining on the other. Modernized armies adopt a policy of elite troops. All units with low morale and weak combat effectiveness should be reduced in size or converted from military to civilian work. Local security forces should be supported by local finances. This is what we hope to see in military streamlining. The organizational structure of central and local agencies and schools is large and extravagant, forming a bloated phenomenon. Moreover, many agencies are redundant and inefficient. We should conduct a thorough review, streamline personnel, and save expenses. This is what we hope to see in administrative streamlining.</p>
<p>In short, improving the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants is necessary today. Equal pay for equal work for civil and military officials can further enhance morale and create new rules for the civil service system, which is very reasonable. However, we want to call the government's attention to the fact that increasing salaries to adjust treatment is only a passive administrative measure and cannot truly solve the livelihood problems of public school teachers and civil servants. Because the trend of rising prices and increasing living expenses makes it difficult for the income of public school teachers and civil servants to adapt, the government must overcome the economic crisis, eliminate the factors of rising prices, and move towards the rational path of economic recovery, which can have practical benefits.</p>
<h3>The Consequences of the Dollar Panic</h3>
<p>The result of the British Labour Party's two years in power is that it has not only failed to overcome the difficulties in the economy but is still mired in a predicament from which it cannot extricate itself. The social democratic party is facing a major test. The British Labour Cabinet, under the leadership of Prime Minister Attlee, has been struggling with the dollar panic in recent days, consulting with the relevant cabinet ministers day after day on the countermeasures to be taken in the future so that Britain can safely overcome the economic difficulties. The British Parliament is also scheduled to meet today to discuss how to cope with the panic of lacking dollars. From this, we can see the difficult situation of the British economy after the war.</p>
<p>According to a report by the Associated Press, Britain has become a tragic world after ten years of recession, six years of arduous war, and two years of the Labour Party's socialist experiment. Today, in London, slogans are posted everywhere, warning the people: "If you don't work, you will freeze and starve!" When we study the reasons for Britain's economic difficulties, in a nutshell, it lies in the lack of dollars. There is nothing in the daily necessities of the British people that is not in a state of shortage. If they want to import from the United States, they must use dollars to buy from the United States. It is said that of the 1 billion dollars that the United States loaned to Britain after the war, 700 million dollars had been used by July of this year, leaving only 300 million dollars. How can this small amount be enough to meet Britain's needs? This is indeed a serious problem.</p>
<p>Former British Prime Minister Churchill, in a speech to 50,000 listeners in Watestock City, Oxfordshire, the day before yesterday, blamed the Labour government entirely for Britain's economic difficulties. He said that the Labour government did not know how to use dollars to buy industrial equipment but completely wasted them on luxury goods. Churchill's words inevitably have the effect of making an issue of something in an attempt to attack the Labour government. However, there are also many undeniable facts in his speech, which not only make it easier for us to understand the economic difficulties in Britain but also allow the American people, especially American businessmen, to know that the difficulties of international trade in the future are far from over.</p>
<p>Britain is now experiencing a dollar panic, and the United States is also worried about the depletion of dollars. This is the case in other countries as well. The dollar panic is certainly the main reason for the economic difficulties of various countries, but for the United States, it is also a serious economic crisis. If the United States does not realize this as soon as possible, make long-term plans, and save others and itself, and still focuses on seeking trade surpluses with various countries, then the United States will eventually have a day when it cannot export goods to trade with other countries, causing a phenomenon of overproduction in the country. Therefore, the consequences of the dollar panic in various countries deserve the close attention of the American government and the public!</p>

<h3>Egyptian Prime Minister Asks Security Council: British Troops Should Withdraw from Egypt and End British Rule in Sudan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council began discussing the Anglo-Egyptian dispute today. After the meeting, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy Pasha personally requested the Security Council to order all British troops to withdraw from Egypt and Sudan and end the current British administration in Sudan so that Egypt could be liberated from the shackles of British imperialism. The Egyptian Prime Minister pointed out that the continued presence of British troops in Egypt is a "latent threat" to peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: Egyptian representative to the Security Council Nokrashy Pasha warned the Security Council today that in today's world, the existence of imperialism can no longer be tolerated and that the United Nations Charter should not be ignored. The Security Council should urge Britain to end its long-term rule over the Nile River Valley and the Suez Canal. Otherwise, the anger of the Egyptian people will inevitably erupt. Pasha requested the Security Council to take the following steps: (1) British troops should withdraw unconditionally and completely from the Nile River Valley; (2) Britain should cease its actual rule over Sudan so that Sudan can merge with Egypt; (3) The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 should be abolished because, from Egypt's point of view, the treaty violates the United Nations Charter and will allow British troops to continue to be stationed in Egypt for nine years.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: A spokesman for the British delegation said that if a majority of the member state representatives on the Security Council do not object, British representative Jebb will refute the points made by Nokrashy Pasha.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 5th] The Chairman of the Security Council announced that the Council will discuss the Egyptian issue at 12:30 PM today (Shanghai time 9:30 PM). U.S. officials said that the United States will participate in the discussion of this matter with an open attitude. Before the Anglo-Egyptian parties state their positions, the U.S. representative will not state its attitude. However, the State Department has been studying this issue in detail for several months. Personnel at the Egyptian Embassy here expressed optimism that the United States would directly support Egypt in the Council, arguing that the Egyptian Prime Minister had received expressions of sympathy during his visit to Truman and Marshall last week. Furthermore, the support of U.S. newspapers for Indonesia shows that the United States may support Egypt.</p>
<h3>Security Council Discusses Greek Issue: Soviet Proposal Rejected; Situation on Greek-Bulgarian Border Suddenly Becomes Tense</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] Soviet representative Gromyko accused Western powers in the Security Council on the 4th of plotting to enslave Greece politically and economically, but the Soviet attempt to overturn the Truman Doctrine suffered a crushing defeat in the vote. The Soviet Union proposed that the Security Council order all foreign military personnel to withdraw from Greece, place all foreign economic assistance under United Nations supervision, and blame the recent disputes between Greece and Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia on the Greek government. In the vote, only the Soviet Union and Poland voted in favor, while the other nine member states of the Security Council voted against it. Before the vote, Gromyko accused "certain countries" of interfering in Greek internal affairs, saying that although this interference was euphemistically called "aid," it was in fact interference. Gromyko did not mention the names of the United States or the Truman Doctrine, but the meaning was quite clear. Gromyko also said that the Soviet Union also felt that Greece did need economic assistance, but at the same time believed that the purpose of this "aid" was not to meet the needs of the Greek people but only to meet Greece's military needs, thus making Greek internal affairs so chaotic. The Polish representative put forward a resolution asking the four Balkan countries to take measures to restore friendship, but the British representative Jebb often dismissed it as a ridiculous suggestion, which was tantamount to admitting the incompetence of the Security Council and was more harmful than beneficial.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th] According to the Turkish News Agency, there was heavy artillery fire in the border areas of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey today, and it has now been confirmed that the shells came from within Bulgarian territory. Greek insurgents and their Slavic accomplices are launching a full-scale offensive into Greek territory from the Bulgarian border. The railway connecting Turkish border cities in Greece has been constantly attacked, and bridges and intersections are particularly targeted for bombing. Thousands of Turkish refugees have now fled from Greece into Turkey. Well-informed foreign sources in Istanbul said that heavy Turkish troops have been assembled in the western border region. They also pointed out that the guerrilla offensive launched from within Bulgarian territory indicates Bulgaria's open support for Greek insurgents, using Bulgarian territory as a strategic base. International observers believe that although the situation may explode at any moment, Turkey is still cautious about sending troops into Greece.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th] The situation in the Balkan Peninsula has been urgent in the past 18 hours. According to Turkish sources, Bulgaria is mobilizing a large army on the Greek border. Since yesterday, the sound of artillery fire has been heard in the western border region of Turkey. The nature of the Bulgarian army's shelling remains to be determined. The rebels in Greek Thrace have rapidly expanded in the past week and are now threatening the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki. The first batch of U.S. military supplies arrived in Greece yesterday. The 100,000 Turks living in northeastern Greece are now returning to Greece. The turmoil caused by the rebels has caused the Turkish government great concern. At present, there is much speculation about Turkey sending troops to help the Greek government suppress the rebels.

<h3>Britain Pays Attention to the Yugoslav-Bulgarian Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government believes that the agreement signed by Yugoslavia and Bulgaria over the weekend is the first diplomatic alliance treaty signed by a former enemy country and an allied country since the end of the war, and that it believes that its target is not Germany but another allied country, Greece. The Foreign Office believes that this alliance will be a turning point in post-war history, and its consequences and impact are being studied closely. Officials here are paying close attention to the fact that the Yugoslav-Bulgarian treaty explicitly mentions the border incidents currently being investigated by the United Nations agencies and the friction with the Greek government. What Athens is most concerned about is whether the treaty also contains secret agreements regarding Greek Macedonia. London has not yet obtained any information on this.</p>
<h3>U.S. Fully Supports Italy and Austria's Membership Applications</h3>

The committee also voted separately to consider Austria's application separately from Hungary, Italy, and Romania. After lengthy discussions, the committee adjourned without reaching any resolution on the applications of the four countries and postponed the discussion until Wednesday.</p>
<h3>US to Send Investigation Team to Dutch East Indies to Observe the Actual Situation; Indonesia Opposes Mediation by a Third Country</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: Since the Dutch and Indonesian sides issued a ceasefire order, the US side has been in contact with the Dutch side. It is reported that the United States is about to send an investigation team to inspect the actual situation. The investigation will be led by the US military.</p>
<p>[United Press Batavia 5th] According to unconfirmed sources on the 5th: Former President Roosevelt's naval advisor, Admiral Leahy, may be the head of the US delegation to mediate the war in Indonesia, in accordance with the US policy of "good offices." Sources close to the Dutch headquarters here point out that Admiral Leahy's position is the same as the roles Marshal and Wedemeyer played in China. The Dutch High Command believes that the US "mediation" is more impartial than that of Britain, as Britain still has to face the responsibilities of India, Burma, and Malaya in Asia. The most important question now is what form the US "good offices" will take. They hope and expect the US to send a mission to investigate the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>Dutch Military Blockades Indonesian Areas</p>
<p>[United Press Batavia 5th] The Dutch Navy announced on the 5th: Despite the ceasefire order, the Dutch Navy will continue to prohibit the transportation of military supplies into Indonesian territory and prohibit the export of agricultural products from Indonesian territory. It also stated that patrol teams will continue to maintain order. Vice Admiral Helfrich, Commander of the Dutch East Indies Navy, issued an order stating: "Military operations have now ceased. It is the duty of the Dutch military to restore and maintain law and order within the territories currently under our administration." Maintaining law and order apparently includes preventing Indonesian troops from infiltrating these territories.</p>

<p>At the same time, Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir announced that due to the Dutch abandonment of the Linggadjati Agreement, with the establishment of autonomous regions in the Belitung Islands, Bangka Islands in eastern Sumatra, and the Riau Islands outside Singapore, the Republic considers the Linggadjati Agreement to be no longer valid. The Republic now seeks to resolve the Indonesian dispute on a new basis. It does not want mediation by a third country but wants arbitration by an international committee. Radio Yogyakarta reported that Prime Minister Sjahrir telegraphed the President of the Security Council, Mr. Coray, that he had accepted the Council's ceasefire proposal and expressed gratitude for the Council's swift action. Sjahrir also requested that the Dutch military withdraw to the demarcation line before July 20 and establish a committee to implement the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>Australia Suggests Sending Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success 4th] At tonight's Security Council meeting, Australian representative Hodgson suggested sending UN officials to Indonesia to keep the Security Council informed of developments there. Hodgson also criticized the Security Council's method of notifying the Indonesian government as extremely inappropriate and accused the Dutch authorities of delaying the transmission of the Security Council's notification, preventing Indonesian officials from conveying the notification to their government. The chairman stated that he would consult with the Secretariat to decide on the Australian representative's suggestion to send personnel to Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Churchill Condemns the Government, Saying that Forming a Coalition Cabinet Cannot Solve the Crisis; British Conservative Party Launches Election Campaign</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 4th] Opposition Leader Churchill delivered his first public speech since undergoing hernia surgery in May to 50,000 listeners at Blenheim Palace in his native Woodstock, Oxfordshire, under the auspices of the Conservative Central Office. He stated that the Conservative Party will support all conscious programs, no matter how severe, in daily life and work to overcome Britain's economic crisis, rather than in Parliament. At the same time, he reiterated that the Conservative Party would oppose any suggestions deemed unwise or unnecessary or aimed at inciting class envy or party hatred. He again severely criticized the Labour government, stating that there was no possibility of forming another coalition cabinet to solve the economic crisis, and that the only hope for national recovery lay in the British electorate removing those who had clearly failed in their duty. "It is only after a national vote removes the culprits whose arrogant theories and personal incompetence are leading Britain to ruin that the current misfortune can be eliminated." Churchill's appearance on the political stage today, when Britain's economic crisis is nearing its peak, is intended to give his actions a historically important position. This speech is the opening salvo of the Conservative Party's election campaign. Churchill himself has made it clear that he and his party will use Britain's economic crisis as their campaign capital and will, if possible, change the situation this autumn.</p>
<h3>British and American Experts to Hold Meeting to Discuss Increasing German Coal Production; Date is August 12, Location is Washington</h3>
<p>[US News Agency Washington 4th] A State Department spokesman stated today that talks between British and American experts on the development of the Ruhr coal mines will begin on August 12. The British and American delegation, led by Sterland (political advisor to the British Commander-in-Chief in Germany), is scheduled to arrive in Washington next Monday. The leader of the US experts has been determined to be Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Thorp.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 4th] The "Ruhr battle" between the US and Britain after the war is entering a new stage. It is planned to increase Ruhr coal production by one-third by the end of the year as a major contribution to the Marshall Plan for European aid. Currently, the Ruhr area produces about 220,000 tons of coal per day, only half of wartime production. In London, Foreign Secretary Bevin tonight reiterated to the House of Commons the UK's established policy of nationalizing the coal mines and factories in the German Ruhr area. Bevin asked: "If these industries do not belong to the people, to whom will they belong? Will they belong to business combinations or the Krupp Company?" Bevin also expressed opposition to France's proposed four-power control plan for the Ruhr. He said, "I do not intend to participate in the four-power control plan for the Ruhr unless the four powers control German industry." When discussing the level of German industry, Bevin advocated that German steel production be increased to about 11 million tons, in line with the German standard of living before Hitler came to power and before the war preparations. He said: "Our goals for Germany are twofold: on the one hand, to enable Germany to live in peace and happiness, and at the same time, to ensure our safety."</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Are Considering Continuing to Reduce Troops Stationed in Europe; British Troops Plan to Withdraw from Italy and Greece Immediately</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 4th] The United States and Britain are considering further reducing the number of occupation troops in Europe to save manpower, not to save American dollars. Washington and Berlin have agreed on various temporary measures to reduce troops, ensuring that they do not hinder American policy and do not overturn the balance between the Western occupation zone and the Soviet occupation zone. It is reported that the number of American troops will be reduced by more than half. However, British Prime Minister Attlee wants to reduce Britain's military burden to save the economic crisis, which is a new factor. The United States has no choice but to continue to study before making a final decision.</p>
<p>The US Army authorities originally believed that with Germany divided into four, international relations chaotic, and the Soviet Union delaying the ratification of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, the 150,000 American troops stationed in Europe could not be reduced any further. However, with the cessation of conscription in the country and the lack of manpower in the army, the Army Department had to re-examine this. Britain has about 350,000 troops stationed in Europe, of which less than 300,000 are stationed in Germany, about 28,000 in Austria, 20,000 in Italy, and 60,000 in Greece. Attlee stated that the troops stationed in Germany would be greatly reduced, and the troops stationed in Greece and Italy would be withdrawn immediately. The withdrawal of British troops from Italy seems to make the US uneasy.</p>
<h3>British Defense Committee Discusses Troop Reduction Plan</h3>

It is said that the number of people to be laid off will be 300,000 from now until the end of the year, reducing the strength of the British army to about one million people.</p>

<p>[United Press Chicago 4th] Renowned pilot Tudden took off in the "Reno's Rocket Bomb" plane, taking the route of Paris, Karachi, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Alaska around the world, attempting to create a new solo flight speed record.

<h3>The San Pao Long Branch of the Kuomintang and Youth Corps Urges the Government to Protect Overseas Chinese with Military Force</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Batavia 4th] The San Pao Long branch of the Chinese Kuomintang and Youth Corps today called on overseas compatriots to unanimously request the government to protect the overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra with military force.

<h3>British Search for Irgun Members Throughout Palestine; Three Mayors and a Large Number of Jews Arrested and Imprisoned</h3>
<p>[United Press Jerusalem 5th] In a nationwide search for suspected underground elements, British authorities here arrested the mayors of Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, and Netanya, and dozens of Jews on the 5th. Troops and police in various parts of Palestine launched simultaneously, arresting Jewish leaders who were considered to sympathize with the Irgun underground organization. Most of the Jews were taken to prisons in Arab areas to prevent the Irgun from rescuing them. The reason why the British Mandate government ordered the search was to crack down on the violence of underground elements. This is the first major operation since the British arrested the leaders of the Jewish Executive Committee during the same period last year. In addition, the arrested included a member of the Tel Aviv City Council and a member of the Revisionist Party of the Ramat Gan Council, as well as dozens of other members of the Rashando Revisionist Party. The British authorities believe that this group is right-wing and most are suspected of conspiring with the Irgun.</p>

<h3>All Sectors Discuss and Decide to Establish an Organization to Comfort and Welcome Servicemen Passing Through en Route to the Front</h3>
<p>Due to the large number of servicemen from various places passing through Shanghai recently, braving the midsummer heat for long marches, their loyalty and bravery are commendable. In order to express condolences and welcome them, the municipal government, the municipal party headquarters, and the municipal council jointly initiated a meeting at 3 pm on the 5th in the municipal government conference room, inviting relevant agencies and organizations to discuss and plan condolence and welcome measures. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Xuan Tiewu, Fu Zhengmo, Xie Renzhao, Zhang Wei, Zhang Xiaosong, Wang Xianqing, Liu Deming, Xu Xiaochu, and many others attended. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting. First, Director Fang of the Committee reported on the living conditions of the servicemen and provided suggestions for comforting the servicemen. Subsequently, Deputy Commander Liu Yaohan of the Port Command and Director Zhu Jingning of the News Division of the United Relief Federation reported on the servicemen's diet, living conditions, and hygiene. Then, discussions began, and detailed decisions were made on the address, meals, hygiene, and comfort of the servicemen passing through Shanghai.</p>
<p>It was also decided to organize the "Shanghai Committee for Welcoming and Comforting Servicemen Passing Through," with all the agencies and organizations attending the meeting as members, and jointly elect the municipal government, the council, the municipal party headquarters, the garrison command, the municipal chamber of commerce, local associations, the port command, the division headquarters, and the Friends of the Military Association as nine standing committee members.</p>
<p>Five groups were established: (1) General Affairs Group, undertaken by the Port Command; (2) Meals Group, undertaken by the Friends of the Military Association; (3) Hygiene Group, undertaken by the Health Bureau; (4) Comfort Group, undertaken by the Municipal Party Headquarters; (5) Finance Group, undertaken by the Municipal Bank.

<p>increase nutrition. The Health Bureau will also administer vaccinations, organize mobile medical teams, and provide bathing and hygiene services. In addition, singing groups, film screening teams, and current affairs photo exhibitions will be held to welcome the servicemen and show respect.</p>
<h3>Four Agencies Accused of Hiding and Selling Assets Worth 300 Million; Allegations of Hiding and Selling Assets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Ding Guitang, Deputy Chief of the Jianghai Customs; Qian Zongqi and Guo Yourong, Jianghai Customs officials; Liu Gongyun, former Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau; Lü Shishang, former Chief of the Investigation Team of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau; Chen Shouzhi, former Chief of the Audit Section of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau; and Wu Rencang, concurrent Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Central Trust Bureau, and six others. Sun Zhuting, Zhu Shengyao, and Cao Haishen recently filed a lawsuit with the judiciary, accusing them of hiding and selling enemy and puppet property, totaling an estimated value of about 300 million yuan. The original complaint stated: During the Shanghai occupation, the warehouse of Ruichang Hardware Store at 340 Dengtu Road was a secret Japanese warehouse, covering an area of about four acres, with materials piled up like mountains. In September of the 34th year of the Republic, the plaintiffs secretly reported it to the Frontline Military Supplies Receiving Committee. At that time, the person in charge of receiving enemy and puppet property was the head of the Materials Group, Lü Shishang. After the plaintiffs secretly reported it, four large military trucks suddenly came to the front of the warehouse, transporting materials back and forth. This lasted for three days.</p>
<p>After the Frontline Military Supplies Receiving Committee was abolished, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau was established, and Lü continued as the head of the Investigation Team of the Bureau. The warehouse was handed over to the Bureau, and then transferred to the Jianghai Customs. The handover was completed on December 11 of the 34th year of the Republic. However, the handover documents did not include the account of the materials transported by the trucks for three days in advance. On December 3 of the 34th year of the Republic, the Jianghai Customs publicly auctioned more than 26,000 pig iron pipes (approximately 600,000 kilograms), more than 800 tons of coal, and countless other rice, wheat, and hardware materials. The confidential informants went to collect the bonus after the auction. According to the Jianghai Customs, only 400 tons of scrap iron were sold, and the previously announced 26,000 pig iron pipes were a clerical error. The plaintiffs refused to receive the bonus at that time and submitted a report to the Enemy Property Liquidation Office of the Central Trust Bureau. The Office replied, stating that the 26,000 pig iron pipes were from the Qiwupu Road warehouse and had nothing to do with the Dengtu Road warehouse mentioned by the confidential informants. The plaintiffs believed that the above four agencies had jointly colluded to hide and sell enemy assets and jointly submitted a statement to the Procuratorate to request a thorough investigation. It is reported that the Procuratorate will summon the relevant personnel in the case for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Heard Lantong's Retrial Announced; Sentence Reduced to Three and a Half Years; No Unfavorable Actions Toward the People, Reduced Accordingly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Heard Lantong, one of the "Three Old Men of Shanghai" during the enemy and puppet period, completed his retrial, and the sentence was announced in the High Court yesterday morning. After Judge Xiao Liang of the Criminal Court took the stand, Heard's defense lawyers Zhu Fuju and Sha Yanka said: "The defendant is unable to attend court due to serious illness. The sentence will be announced by the defense lawyers on behalf of the defendant." Judge Xiao then stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Heard Lantong, colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist our country, sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for three years, and confiscation of property except for the necessary living expenses for the family." Then, he sat down and briefly stated the reasons for the judgment: "The defendant served in a puppet position for more than three years, during which he participated in matters such as collecting military rice and cotton yarn for the enemy, colluding with the enemy and puppets. Although the defendant argued that the matter had been submitted to the Central Bureau of Statistics for approval, considering what he did, it cannot be said that he did not benefit the enemy. Considering that the defendant did not engage in any unfavorable actions towards the people during his tenure in the puppet position, the original sentence of eight years seems a bit heavy. The sentence is reduced to three years and six months after considering the crime and circumstances."</p>
<h3>New Public Bus Routes to Extend to Wusong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] It has been two years since the transportation between Shanghai and Wusong has been formally restored after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, causing public grievances. Previously, Dong Fei, director of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, repeatedly wrote to Chen Bozhuang, director of the Two-Way Administration, urging him to find a way to restore the Shanghai-Wusong transportation to facilitate commercial transportation, but it has been delayed until now and has not been repaired, which has greatly affected the commerce of Wusong, especially the pig industry. It is now learned that the Public Works Bureau is first trying to run public buses, extending from the intersection of Shishan Road in Shanghai to Wusong Outer Ma Road. The road signs for each station have been arranged, and the Public Works Bureau is rushing to repair the road surface through which the buses will pass. A trial run will be conducted within days.</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax Revenue Greatly Increased; Reaching 500 Million Yuan Per Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Recently, the stamp tax revenue of the Direct Taxation Bureau has greatly increased, reaching 500 million yuan per day, the best record since the restoration. According to past experience, late autumn and early winter, and around the Lunar New Year, are the peak months for stamp tax, while spring and summer are relatively quiet. The current increase in tax revenue during the height of summer indicates that citizens have gradually understood their tax obligations. The recently revised Stamp Tax Law stipulates that stamp tax should be paid on certificates (including purchase invoices) of more than 5,000 yuan. However, with the high prices of goods today, costing tens of thousands of yuan for a haircut, transactions of less than 5,000 yuan are rare. In view of the factual needs, the Direct Taxation Bureau plans to submit a request to the authorities to raise the threshold. Before the revision, it will focus on publicity and guidance to cultivate the habit of paying stamp tax, and small-amount tax evasion will not be punished for the time being.</p>
<h3>Port Area Defined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee will hold its 36th meeting this morning. According to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the scope of the Shanghai port area has been discussed and decided. The Huangpu River, from Minhang to the Wusongkou, and the waterway outside the Wusongkou to the Yangtze River, which is the throat of the city, will be permanently managed by the Port Authority. It is stipulated that the Suzhou River starts from the Waibaidu Bridge, and the wharves on both banks are temporarily not included in the scope.</p>
<p>At today's meeting, the first draft of the organizational outline of the Shanghai Port Authority will be discussed. The draft has been passed by a second reading at the 34th meeting on July 23. It will be passed by a third reading today, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process.</p>
<h3>Heard About Rationed Goods, Many New Businesses Open, Social Affairs Bureau Considers Suspending Registration, Registered Businesses to be Reviewed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The main daily necessities currently rationed by the municipal authorities include sugar, coal briquettes, rice, and oil, mostly entrusted to various businesses for sale. Speculators, seeing the potential for profit, are rushing to register businesses, some even setting up fictitious entities. Coal Industry Association, Machine-Made Coal Briquette Business Association, Sugar Business Association, etc., argue that the rationed goods entrusted by the authorities for sale are already limited. The rapid establishment of new businesses leads to a situation where the porridge is scarce and the monks are many, resulting in insufficient allocation. Established businesses of many years may not even obtain sales rights, and legitimate profits are being搶奪 (snatched away), creating a situation where the guests are usurping the role of the host. They have jointly petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to restrict the establishment of new businesses. The Social Affairs Bureau is now drafting measures to be submitted to the municipal meeting for discussion, considering suspending the registration of businesses, and those already registered will be subject to review. The Social Affairs Bureau had already suspended the application for sugar business registration in June.</p>
<h3>Malley Detained Pending Investigation, Extradition for Questioning Possible Once Evidence is Complete</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Staff Sergeant Malley, a U.S. soldier arrested by the Fan Constabulary based on the testimony of the Englishman Quillian regarding the shooting death of Yu Shengxiao, is currently being detained by the U.S. military police. Yesterday, the Nanjing U.S. Military Liaison Group stated that once the Chinese police have completed their search for evidence, he can be extradited for legal proceedings. Malley is an active-duty soldier serving at the U.S. Army Hospital in Shanghai. The police remain skeptical of Quillian's claim that he was not the shooter, as his statements seem to be an attempt to shift the blame to others. The next step in the police investigation is to locate a "black military [vehicle] stained with blood" and the murder weapon. According to the police, tracing the handgun is difficult because all three bullets fired passed through the body and left no marks, making it impossible to identify the type of gun.</p>
<h3>Sharp Reduction in Oil Imports, Authorities Discuss Rationing Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the Import Management Committee's announcement of the third-quarter import quotas yesterday, the city's fuel supply is facing a severe threat. According to the regulations, starting in August, while diesel fuel will increase from $6.25 million to $7 million, gasoline and kerosene will be significantly reduced. Gasoline will decrease from $2.5 million to $2 million, about an 80% cut, and kerosene will decrease from $3.3 million to $2 million, about a 60% cut. The city's oil consumption is substantial, and it will inevitably be affected. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter visited Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to inquire about possible remedies. Zhao stated that after the sudden reduction in oil imports, supply inevitably will not meet demand, and it may be necessary to adopt a rationing system. As for detailed and specific rules, the Public Utilities Bureau has scheduled a meeting this afternoon with representatives from six relevant agencies, including the Police Bureau, the Dredging Bureau, the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and the Customs, to discuss and formulate them.</p>

At that time, the Communist bandits' highest military command in the Northeast was located in Tieling, and it was presided over by a senior military officer of a certain country. The Communist bandits' siege of Siping lasted for half a month, and the bayonet fighting was particularly fierce.

<h3>Red and Green Flags Outside the Social Affairs Bureau, Thirty-Six Apprentices Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The An Tai Iron Factory at the end of Xiaoshadu Road previously submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the factory's 36 apprentices had repeatedly participated in strikes and work stoppages, disrupting the factory's operations, and requested permission to expel them. After the Social Affairs Bureau approved the expulsion, it issued an order on July 29th to stop work and complete the departure procedures immediately. Yesterday afternoon, the 36 apprentices, holding red and green paper flags, marched in a line to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition and distribute declarations, claiming that their participation in the strikes and work stoppages was entirely due to threats from the workers. Now that they have been expelled by the factory, they have only learned about 30-40% of the required skills, and it will be difficult to find employment after leaving the factory, inevitably leading to unemployment. Moreover, their families are poor, and they will be reprimanded by their parents when they return home. The factory has stopped providing meals, and they can only endure hunger while awaiting orders. According to the Social Affairs Bureau, the apprentices are demanding that the factory pay each of them a severance fee of 1.6 million, which has no legal basis. Later, the factory agreed to pay each of them 350,000, which they refused to accept. If they disagree with the Social Affairs Bureau's order, they can apply to the Municipal Government for arbitration.</p>

<h3>Severance Terms Not Settled, Laborers Riot, Sixty-Four Congee Shops Close</h3>
<p>Recently, congee shops in this city have been experiencing sluggish business and are unable to sustain operations. They plan to lay off some workers and reduce expenses. They are willing to provide the workers with half of their annual bonus for severance, in accordance with Article 2, Section 3 and Article 4 of the previously agreed-upon conciliation record. The workers firmly refused to accept this. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau ruled that the severance payment should be issued in accordance with Item C of the First Resolution of the Second Meeting of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee. However, this resolution stipulates that "industries with existing agreements may still follow their agreements." Therefore, the employers convened a meeting at 6:00 PM on the 29th of last month to decide on the severance method. Unexpectedly, at this time, Pan Fagen, a standing director of the workers' union, suddenly led more than 30 workers to the meeting place and beat Shi Guansong, who was present, into an injury. The case was reported to the Xincheng Police Precinct. It is said that Pan was still not satisfied and ordered the workers to strike. When Li Jinbao, a worker at the Chen Futai congee shop at No. 37 Zhejiang South Road, continued to work, he angered Pan, who led Ma Xiaofa and others to coerce him at 9:00 PM on the 2nd of this month. When they disagreed, they severely beat Li, and the case was filed with the Huangpu Police Precinct. On the 4th, Zhao Chungeng, chairman of the workers' union, led more than 30 workers to the Pan Fuxing congee shop on Zhejiang Road and beat the shop owner, Pan Shuhong, into an injury. Geng Jifeng and Li Baohua, who were present, were also injured. The Laozha Police Precinct arrested and interrogated the perpetrators. It is learned that the congee shop owners, feeling that the workers' union has repeatedly resorted to violence and is unreasonable, have closed their shops and are awaiting mediation by the Standing Bureau. It is reported that 64 of the industry's 81 members have closed their shops.</p>

<p>During the 10th Members' Congress of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in June of this year, a temporary emergency motion was passed by representatives such as Luo Qinghua and Liu Jingji, stating that the economic crisis was becoming increasingly serious and requesting the Central Government to take emergency precautions to ensure social stability and national security. The motion contained seven articles with suggested measures. The Chamber of Commerce submitted the motion to the relevant central ministries, requesting prompt adoption and implementation. Yesterday, the Ministry of Economic Affairs replied by telegram, stating: Article (1) of the original motion, which calls for treating the symptoms in an emergency to prevent factories and shops from closing and workers from losing their jobs, should be handled in accordance with Article 5 of the Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government upon the Completion of Mobilization for the Suppression of Communist Rebellion. (2) Regarding "in-kind lending" and "order system," the matter will be referred to the National Economic Commission for review. (3) Regarding the government's overall planning for the supply of raw materials and fuel, encouraging people to transport and sell goods, but strictly prohibiting non-manufacturers from hoarding and speculating, the supply of raw materials is currently being actively planned. Before the detailed plan is finalized, the supply of industrial raw materials in all localities will continue to be adjusted by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry. As for fuel, the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee has repeatedly been ordered to purchase and transport coal from Taiwan, Kai, the Northeast, and Huainan to alleviate the shortage, and the Ministry has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to purchase American coal for emergency needs. Regarding the encouragement of people to transport and sell goods, the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee has formulated measures for manufacturers to purchase and transport bituminous coal themselves, which have been announced and implemented. Strictly prohibiting non-manufacturers from hoarding and speculating, and Article (7) of the original motion regarding cracking down on speculation, are already strictly regulated by the "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Periods" and the "Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Minerals, Industry, and Commerce During Extraordinary Periods." (4) Regarding production enterprises that encounter a shortage of funds, the state banks should provide sufficient loans as needed, the Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed the Joint Treasury to handle the matter. If various industries need it, they can apply directly to the local Joint Treasury branch. (5) Regarding cases where manufacturers are unable to continue operating due to various reasons, the government should temporarily maintain them, and all products should be exported as much as possible regardless of cost if they are suitable for export, and sold at par if they are suitable for daily necessities, the Ministry has telegraphed the National Economic Commission for discussion. (6) Regarding the government's principle of ensuring the survival of factories and shops and the livelihoods of workers, and setting minimum wages by industry, the Executive Yuan has issued the "Provisional Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai," and the Executive Yuan has ordered that wages may be discounted by a certain percentage based on the cost of living index, from 90% to 60%. Regarding the issue of excessively high worker base salaries, the National Economic Commission is studying and formulating separate measures.</p>

They stated that at around 12:00 PM on July 28, Shi and Fan contacted them by phone, claiming that the shop had a large quantity of rice for sale and requested them to sell it on their behalf. Because they were fellow traders, they all agreed to buy a certain amount of rice, and it was agreed that the goods would be delivered the next day. On the afternoon of that day, at around 2:00 PM, Shi and Fan suddenly told the victims that the customers urgently needed the funds and requested the victims to pay the purchase price in advance. The victims, not suspecting anything, paid Shi and Fan the amounts of 3-5 million, totaling over 40 million. The next day, the goods did not arrive.

<h3>Acting as Agent to Collect Land Certificates; Younger Sister Fooled by Older Brother; Pledging Funds for Failed Speculation; Qian Zelin and Others Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Qian Zelin and Zhu Qiyi have been accused of fraud, and the District Prosecutor's Office has recently filed a public prosecution. A certain Qu Qianpeizhen owns real estate in the Renzhou Li neighborhood of Haining Road in this city and possesses an old deed. Last year, she applied to the Land Administration Bureau for registration and to exchange for a land ownership certificate, submitting the old deed to the bureau and obtaining a receipt. The defendant, Qian Zelin, is Qu Qianpeizhen's cousin, who falsely claimed that he could find a way to help through connections and obtain the land certificate from the bureau in a short period of time. Qu Qianpeizhen believed him and handed over the receipt issued by the bureau, along with her personal seal and land tax bills, to Qian Zelin. On January 16th of this year, Qian, colluding with Zhu Qiyi, pledged the above-mentioned deed receipt and borrowed 20 million legal tender from Sheng Yanfang. Due to failed speculation, they were unable to repay the loan. Zhu then approached Sheng and requested to retrieve the deed receipt first. After the pledge, they returned it to Sheng. Through Zhu's introduction, they borrowed 50 million legal tender from Chen Weida at a monthly interest of 10 million, with a three-month term. Qian drew up a temporary sales contract, allowing for redemption within the deadline. After repaying Sheng's principal and interest, the remaining funds were used for speculation, which again failed. On March 24th of this year, Qian borrowed another 15 million legal tender from Chen Dada. Unable to repay the principal and interest, he signed a check from the China Bank with a date of June 24th of this year in the name of Qu Qianpeizhen, with a face value of 24 million yuan (including interest). Chen went to cash the check at maturity, but it was dishonored. Upon pursuing Qu for payment, Qu then learned that she had been defrauded by Qian, Zhu, and others. The victim reported the incident to the police station, which forwarded it to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The prosecutor charged Qian Zelin with violations of Article 339, Paragraph 1, and Article 56 of the Criminal Code, and Zhu Qiyi with violations of Article 339, Paragraph 1, and Article 30 of the Criminal Code, and filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Murder Case in Tianjin; Inside Story of the "Ghost Market Head"; Shan Mingju's Heart Was Dug Out; Suspect Ren Likui Detained and Sent to Court for Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tianjin] The "Head Case" in Tianjin has caused a great stir in the city for the past half month. After half a month of investigation by the police, the details of the case have come to light. It turns out to be a tragic event caused by the sexual perversion of an unscrupulous Taoist priest. The main suspect has already been sent to the Tianjin District Court for trial. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Bloody Sack</p>
<p>Near the Xiguangkai shooting range in Tianjin, there is a "Rabbit Market," which is a place where the lower classes conduct various transactions before dawn. During the "ghostly" hours of this ghost market, on July 14th, a sack was discovered at the entrance of the Xihutong Alley near the shooting range. When opened, a large, bloody human head rolled out, and the body was missing. The head was quite handsome, with a section of long hair cut off. Examination revealed that there were injuries from a wooden stick on the right temple and top of the head. It could be determined that the person was killed before being decapitated and discarded. Thus, the ghost market head case spread throughout the city.</p>
<p>Police Detectives Mobilized</p>
<p>Upon learning of this bizarre murder case, the police first examined the head. Based on the fact that the head hair was cut and the sideburns were very long, it was determined that the deceased was a Taoist priest. Accordingly, a large number of detectives were dispatched to investigate the three major groups of the Tianjin Longhua Buddhist Association, the Taoist Association, and the Jade Emperor Temple. After three days of investigation, the name of the deceased was finally discovered: Shan Mingju, 28 years old, from Tai'an, Shandong, residing at No. 3 Kaiyuan Li, Zhaojiashen Street, Tianjin. He lived there with another Taoist priest, Ren Likui (46 years old, from Qinghe). Further investigation revealed that Shan Mingju was a Taoist priest from the Baiyun Temple in Beiping, tall and handsome. He came to Tianjin from Beiping two months ago and originally lived in the Rongji Store on Zhaojiayao Street. He became close to Ren Likui and was persuaded by Ren to live together in Kaiyuan Li on May 12th. On the evening of July 13th, Shan Mingju was still playing mahjong with acquaintances Sun Xiujing, Li Qingrong, and Yuan Jixing at No. 5 Kaiyuan Li, and they dispersed at 4:00 AM, only two or three hours before his head was discovered in the ghost market.</p>
<p>Feigning Madness</p>
<p>Based on the investigation, the police went to No. 3 Kaiyuan Li, where Ren and Shan lived, on the 17th. They found that the bricks in the house seemed to be floating. When the bricks were lifted, the soil was loose, and there were faint blood stains. Bloodstains were also found on the walls. There were two flower pots put together under the bed, one containing a lock of long hair and the other containing a wooden stick, both covered in blood. The long hair was identical to the hair of the head in the ghost market. When asked about Shan Mingju's whereabouts, Ren Likui replied that he did not know. When asked about the bloodstains, he claimed that it was chicken blood. He also claimed that Shan Mingju bled when he fought with someone, but he flatly denied the murder, and the body was still missing. After the police detained Ren Likui, Ren feigned madness at the police station, stopping eating, holding his breath, and refusing to confess, which made the police feel quite troubled.</p>
<p>Digging Up the Body Underground</p>
<p>After three days of interrogation and inducement, Ren Likui finally confessed that Shan Mingju was indeed killed by him and that the body was buried under the water tank behind the northwest door of his residence. On the 29th, the police sent personnel to dig up the body and indeed found Shan Mingju's headless body two feet deep underground. The whole body was wrapped in old cotton, tied with old wires and hemp ropes. The upper body was naked, wearing sweatpants. Examination revealed that there were injuries from a wooden stick on the back, chest, and left arm of the body, a knife wound on the chest, six and a half inches long and three inches wide, with the belly exposed and the heart having been dug out. Examination of the lower body revealed that the genitals had also been cut off. During interrogation about the motive for the murder, Ren refused to confess and continued to pretend to be a fool, spouting nonsense. The inside story of the case remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Feminine Temperament</p>
<p>It was not until the 26th that the truth of the case became clear. According to the police's investigation, Ren Likui was originally a "Lord Longyang" with a sexual perversion, that is, someone who pretends to be a woman and engages in homosexual relationships. According to Wang Wenqing, who once lived with Ren Likui, "Last spring, I was introduced by a friend to live in a house with Ren Likui. After moving in, I found that Ren Likui had a rather feminine temperament. He repeatedly used words to seduce me. At that time, he cooked and served me at home, but he did not allow me to go home. He often quarreled because of this. Once, he even threw a kitchen knife at me and told me to chop him to death. It was not until January 29th of this year, when he was 'worshipping the stars' and no one was allowed in the house for twelve days, that I took the opportunity to move away."</p>
<p>Moved by Jealousy</p>
<p>Based on this confession, it was determined that there must have been a sexual relationship between Ren and Shan. Unexpectedly, Shan was a dissolute Taoist priest who did everything, including eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, and often did not return late at night, which aroused Ren Likui's jealousy and led him to kill him. This can be seen from Ren Likui's digging out of Shan Mingju's heart and genitals, but Ren Likui has not yet admitted this point.</p>
<p>Why did Ren Likui throw the head into the ghost market? The answer can be found in what Ren Likui said to people before the murder. He said, "After a person dies, the ghost follows the head." He obviously hoped that the ghost would not haunt his house, so he discarded it in the ghost market. (Reporter Li Shaolin, 8/3)</p>

<h3>A Rural Engineer Discovers Small Mine in Zhengzhou; University Students Ashamed of Insufficient Experience</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhengzhou] There are many small-scale coal mines being developed in the western Henan valley. Gongyi has more than ten mines, each with three to five mine shafts, producing 6 million tons annually. Yuxian has 53 mine shafts, producing 1 million tons annually. Other counties such as Mixian, Dengfeng, Yanshi County, and Fanshui also have a large amount of coal production. These small-scale mine shafts are mostly mined after being surveyed by rural engineers. Those rural engineers don't know what ore veins are, nor do they know what instruments to use to measure them, they just rely on their experience, looking to see if the land is surrounded by mountains, what kind of trees grow on the mountains, and how the streams run between the mountains, and then use their steps instead of measuring instruments to determine whether there is coal in a certain place. If there is, they can also say how deep you can dig to see coal, and what kind of coal it is. It is said that there is also so-called watermelon field coal, that is, under this coal field, one coal pile after another is scattered like watermelons in the field. That rural engineer can also point out from which point to dig down to get into the heart of a watermelon. In that case, in two or three years, this factory can rise to prominence relying solely on this one watermelon.</p>
<p>There was a graduate who graduated from university with a degree in mining last year and went to Mixian to look for mines, saying that he had discovered a coal mine. Provincial Governor Liu was very happy and spent 200 million yuan and borrowed drilling machines from Chongqing. As a result, they drilled to a depth of 20 zhang and still didn't see any coal. A rural engineer next to him saw and said, "You read in books that there is coal in this place, but I looked at the ground and didn't know there was coal." In the end, that university student had to retreat in despair and abandon the idea of continuing mining.</p>
<p>At 12:00 PM on July 12th, a tragedy occurred at a carbon mine in Yiyang. More than 100 miners were buried alive in the well, and four miners died on the well, and 37 were injured. The reason was that the mine suddenly collapsed. Mines that don't pay attention to safety equipment are prone to this kind of trouble. The provincial government has stationed personnel in the mines to collect income tax, hoping to send more people or conduct roving inspections to pay more attention to safety equipment and miners' welfare.

In the Peiping-Tianjin area, "Beiyang" is struggling through hardships and is gradually recovering. "Nankai," thanks to the leadership of President Zhang Boling and its spirit of hard work, has largely restored its former appearance. Generally speaking, all colleges and universities feel that equipment is insufficient, and the lack of faculty housing is the most serious problem. Professors in Peiping and Tianjin hope to enjoy the same allocation benefits (rice, wheat, coal, etc.) as professors in Beijing and Shanghai. Mr. Hang has promised to find a way to solve this problem as soon as possible after returning to Beijing. Currently, foreign students are studying in various schools, and many international scholars who come to China are willing to visit Peiping. Comparing the current situation in various parts of the country, Peiping is still the center of education and culture in China and will bear the responsibility of promoting international culture in the future. He believes that after the libraries and instruments of the schools are enriched, the salaries of professors are increased, and life is stabilized, the golden age of universities four or five years before the war can be restored in the short term. As for the students, because Peiping and Tianjin are close to the war zone, their emotions are excited, their lives are serious, and there has been a large increase in the number of students taking the entrance examination this year. At this point, the reporter asked about the incident of Jida dismissing professors and inviting reporters to report. Mr. Hang said: There have been no similar incidents in the universities of Peiping and Tianjin because all schools have committees. Whether or not a professor's contract is renewed depends entirely on their teaching performance and academic level, and is decided by a meeting of all committee members. The president cannot arbitrarily decide to retain or dismiss them. This has become an extremely good tradition in Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University. Regarding the Jida incident, Mr. Hang said that from the Ministry of Education's standpoint, it should take a trusting attitude toward the president and should not interfere.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to the person in charge of the Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee, Mr. Hang will come to Shanghai soon after returning to Beijing because the reorganization of Jiaotong University's affairs is in urgent need of handling.</p>

<h3>Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament – Huayan Wins and Loses Equally – Youlian Wins Against Nanxing in the Women's Group</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The second Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament held three matches last night. The heavy rain caused few spectators to attend the games. As a result, the two teams of Huayan (Group A) won and lost equally. Group A beat Jinyuan in three straight sets. However, Group B lost to Yongsha after a hard-fought match. In the women's group, Youlian also continued their victory by overwhelmingly beating Nanxing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's results:</p>
<p>(1) Huayan A defeated Jinyuan (Men's A) 21-13, 21-14, 21-6.</p>
<p>(2) Yongsha defeated Huayan B (Men's B) 21-8, 21-11, 21-12.</p>
<p>(3) Youlian defeated Nanxing (Women) 21-11, 21-10.</p>
<p>Huayan A defeated Jinyuan (Men's A)</p>
<p>Huayan A's front row, Wang Junbing, relied on Qian Jiaxiang's powerful attacks, as did Weng Chengguang. However, Jinyuan defended effectively, once taking the lead at 7-5, two points ahead of Huayan. After much back and forth, Huayan A took the lead with 11-9 to win the right to change sides. After that, the situation changed, and Huayan suddenly jumped ahead, ending the first set at 21-13. Liang Weiyi's serve also contributed a lot.</p>
<p>In the second set, Jinyuan served first and showed some energy, repeatedly tying the score. However, Huayan A gradually took the lead by one or two points. This set ended at 21-14.</p>
<p>Huayan continued to take the lead in the third set. At the change of sides, it was 11-4. Huayan was in "strict formation" awaiting the attack. Jinyuan's front row, Xu Mouliang, displayed a few closing techniques, but the final result was 21-6.</p>

<p>Yongsha was full of talent, and Huayan B was naturally no match for their sharpness. However, looking at the stalemate between the two armies, Huayan B can also be called a very promising team, and the future should be watched with admiration. Moreover, many of the team's players have been promoted to Huayan's A team, and their strength has decreased accordingly last night.</p>
<p>Watching Yongsha's quick and heavy set and spike was amazing. In terms of the height of the players, none were below five and a half feet, and many were also Minyue athletes and Shanghai basketball stars.</p>

<h3>Checks Cannot Be Cashed on the Same Day; Significant Impact on Industry and Commerce; Banking Association Suggests Compromise: Providing Guarantees to Allow Same-Day Cashing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the Ministry of Finance's investigation into the practice of allowing financial institutions to cash checks on the same day, our reporter specifically consulted with a leading authority in the city's financial sector. The authority stated: "There is no basis in the negotiable instruments law for allowing same-day cashing of checks that have not yet been received. From the perspective of banking and financial practices, it is also not within the scope of business. Therefore, there is no such thing as a 'ban' on same-day cashing in the financial sector." However, it will inevitably impact the turnover of general industrial and commercial sales. Currently, due to inflation, the receipt, settlement, and payment of funds are moving into the hundreds of millions. Checks are virtually the only means of payment. Furthermore, due to the practice of allowing same-day cashing of checks, the financial sector is implicitly providing industry and commerce with the convenience of one day's advance in capital turnover. If this is abruptly banned, industry and commerce will definitely feel greatly inconvenienced. If same-day checks are to be cashed, the funds must be raised and deposited overnight. Those who previously used same-day checks will now have to use large amounts of cash, which will inevitably create a shortage of cash."</p>
<p>[Another Report] It is reported that the city's Banking and Commercial Association, in order to reduce the inconvenience caused by checks not being cashed on the same day, has specifically suggested a compromise to the authorities. For customers who cash checks on the same day, they will be required to issue a guarantee, providing a definite assurance of payment within the amount of the funds cashed. This suggestion is still awaiting final approval from the financial authorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to opinions from the four banks and two bureaus, from the perspective of national banks and bureaus, same-day cashing cannot be allowed to avoid bounced checks. The four banks and two bureaus not only do not allow it now, but also did not allow it in the past. If same-day checks could be cashed, it would be equivalent to increasing inflation. Commercial banks, on the other hand, are mostly accommodating with same-day cashing in order to increase deposits. In reality, in order to stabilize the business of the banking and financial sector itself and to curb inflation, same-day cashing of checks should definitely be prohibited.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the National Federation of Banking Associations: This move is to consolidate the original intent of commercial credit, and the number of returned checks in the future may be reduced as a result.</p>
<h3>Selling Pressure Envelops the Market; Chinese Stocks Retreat Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, most Chinese stocks, except for No. 235, were released into the market in almost their entirety. The money supply tightened, and the buying protection was lost. No. 32 and others even engaged in short selling. Therefore, from morning to noon, under the consistent pressure of selling, they succumbed to the bottom. Resistance was weak in the middle, and at the close, all popular stocks ended at low prices.</p>
<p>The market opened weakly. Delivery of Yongsha opened considerably lower. After opening, No. 60, No. 91, No. 153, No. 160, No. 4, No. 97, No. 157, No. 152, No. 76, and No. 32 were sold, and the market fell to 237 yuan. Nos. 218, 106, and 178 took advantage of the low prices to buy and slightly stabilize the market. Nos. 32, 152, 224, 103, 60, 212, and 154 were sold in large quantities, and No. 89 even sold spot Yongsha aggressively, pushing the price down to 229 yuan and 223 yuan. After 10:00 AM, Nos. 158, 85, 95, 219, and 218 took the opportunity to buy, but only pulled the price up by two yuan. Nos. 45, 197, 231, 32, and 162 were sold in large quantities, and No. 67 sold spot Yongsha in large quantities. After 10:45 AM, delivery of Yongsha also broke below 230 yuan. Nos. 16, 224, 97, 162, 169, 186, and 142 all sold. Nos. 202, 177, and 190 sold spot Yongsha in large quantities. In the afternoon, delivery of Yongsha fell to 225 yuan and then rebounded slightly, while spot Yongsha closed at a low price of 222 yuan. No. 141 supplied Xingguang, and the chips loosened, so it also closed at a low price.</p>
<p>After the close, delivery of Yongsha bids were initially low and then high, initially dropping to 224 yuan, and then closing at 227 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, delivery and spot shares of Yongsha, Huafeng, and Xingguang fell by about 10%. Meiya, Jingfu, Xinhe, Yonggong, Qinxing, and Zhongfa fell by a strong 5%. Xinhua fell by a weak 5%. Cement, Tongyi, Zhongfang, and Datong fell slightly. Jinglun had few transactions and fell by 15%. Lian and Zhongshen fell by about 10%, and Match fell by a strong 5%.

Before the court's verdict, it should be ordered to temporarily suspend business for three weeks from August 6th to August 26th.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Decline</h3>
<p>Government bonds were generally flat yesterday, while unified bonds continued to weaken due to continued liquidation by multiple parties. Although Room 555 bought, Rooms 230 and 360 sold. After opening at 10,900 yuan, the high price was 11,400 yuan and the low was 10,350 yuan, after which it stabilized slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Types A, B, D, and E each fell by 100 yuan, and unified Type C fell by 600 yuan. Transactions were approximately 5 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also could not be sustained yesterday and were exhausted. Material and exchange rates further assisted selling, and the weakness of each stock became more apparent. Yisha opened at 90,000 yuan and formed an oversupply, gradually falling to a low price of 85,000 yuan at the close. Jewish merchants still had a buying appetite for steel and paper. Securities firms advanced first and then exited, banks also supplied, foreign firms also scraped, and Guangdong firms sold aggressively at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson fell slightly, and British American Tobacco, Union Industries, Guangyi, and Beer all fell by about 10%. Yisha Steel fell by a strong 10%, and the remaining stocks all fell by about 5%.</p>
<h3>National Bank Discount Meeting Approves Loans of 6.2 Billion</h3>

<h3>Spot Cotton Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was sluggish due to the continued decline in cotton yarn prices. Both supply and demand were weak. Yarn factories were selling at negotiated prices, and due to cost considerations, they lowered their purchase prices. Customers were unwilling to sell cheaply, and transactions were quiet. The prices quoted by various firms for delivery to factories were: Han fine 2.1 million, Fire Machine 1.72 million, 1.73 million. The price for delivery to the warehouse was: Lingbao 2.105 million, 2.12 million, 2.13 million, Chong Tongzhou 1.78 million, 1.895 million, Hankou fine velvet 1.93 million, 1.94 million, 1.96 million, 1.97 million, Fire Machine 1.725 million, Chong Taicang 1.76 million, Ju Pu seed cotton 328,000.</p>

<h3>Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Alliance Negotiates with the Textile Development Corporation for Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The Shanghai cotton textile industry, in view of the fact that Japanese goods have historically sold well in Nanyang and have a long history, and that once Japan's foreign trade is opened, Japanese goods will undoubtedly restore their original position in the Nanyang market, leaders Xu Wenzhao and Chuan Liangjun launched a joint cotton textile production and sales alliance company, uniting the shirt, undershirt, sock, handkerchief, towel, blanket, and clothing industries to consolidate our country's market in that region. The preliminary plan is to ship 200,000 machines, 150,000 undershirts, 250,000 towels, 10,000 blankets, 20,000 shirts, and 140,000 handkerchiefs to the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines to earn foreign exchange and expand our country's domestic goods market. It is estimated that the above finished products require approximately 3,610 pieces of 16-count, 20-count, 32-count, 40-count, and 42-count yarn, and the processing fees are approximately 34.8 billion yuan. The finished products are valued at 69.2 billion yuan at the initial market price, which is equivalent to 3.5 million US dollars. Because the company lacks raw materials and processing fees, it has submitted a report to the National Economic Commission requesting relevant agencies to allocate them. In principle, the National Economic Commission has already approved the case at its regular meeting on the 12th of last month and has transferred it to the Textile Adjustment Committee and the Four Allied Headquarters for review. In order to actively expand production, the person in charge of the company negotiated with the Textile Development Corporation yesterday regarding the supply of raw materials. It is reported that the Textile Development Corporation strongly agrees with the principle and will continue to discuss the details of supply after the company's organization matures.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Japanese Yarn and Cloth Ship Through Shanghai to Nanyang, Totaling Over 5,000 Tons, Estimated at Over 20,000 Pieces</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Dutch ship Chizdaney, which sailed from Shanghai to Kobe at the end of last month, returned from Japan to Shanghai the day before yesterday (3rd), transiting through Xiamen, Hong Kong, Singapore and other places to return to Surabaya. There were more than 180 passengers in the city and only four suitcases of cargo. However, it carried a considerable amount of cotton yarn and cloth, totaling more than 5,000 tons and estimated at more than 20,000 pieces, from Kobe. This is one of the dynamics of Japan in the Nanyang market. According to import and export merchants, our country cannot operate because it prohibits the transportation and sale of yarn and cloth overseas.</p>
<p>Yarn Market Commentary</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened weakly, because sales from Tianjin and Guangdong were sluggish, and there was very little purchasing. Near the close, some scattered sellers were selling off their inventory, and the market was flooded with chips, making the market even weaker. As a result, 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn fell 350,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 16.9 million yuan. 20-count special double Ma 12.3 million, light double Ma 10.4 million, all fell 450,000 yuan. The remaining 30-count Da Nu Jincheng Ren Zhong, 16-count Sanming Hongfeng, 10-count Jinbao Xing, and 42-count Shuiyue, 40-count Jixiang Baoguang and other coarse and fine yarns all continued to fall by 200,000 to 400,000 or 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth Market Dull</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw traders attempt to push up prices at the opening, but scattered households and dyeing factories frequently sold off their inventory. It was also heard that the Textile Development Corporation has 100,000 bolts of "Four Gentlemen" brand, "Golden Seal" Yuan Bijin in stock and is selling them off in succession. Furthermore, the Cantonese and Hubei merchants are having difficulty selling in their local markets, and there is no progress in sales in the local stores, so the market was depressed. By the end of the day, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 426,000 yuan, a drop of 6,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortunes Colorful Ball Blue Chicken and other fine cloths also continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 or 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The market for the remaining white cloth, bleached cloth, fine cloth, and other Bijin blue cloth and Shi Lin cloth was also unremarkable.</p>
<p>Another report: The China Textile Development Corporation sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 4,155 bolts. There were a total of 137 purchase orders. Three domestic manufacturers purchased 255 bolts, and 134 cloth companies purchased 3,900 bolts. Twenty-four types of cloth were offered, including 12B fine cloth at 370,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen Golden Seal Yuan Bijin at 466,000 yuan, down 6,000 yuan from before. Ding Ruyi bleached cloth was 500,000 yuan flat, Shuiyue bleached cloth was 375,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan from before, Jumping Carp bleached cloth was 442,000 yuan, down 3,000 yuan from before, and no-brand 41g fabric was 488,000 yuan, a rise of 8,000 yuan. Other prices were similar, and applicants were not very enthusiastic.</p>

It is estimated that loans for autumn cocoons will need to reach 130 billion yuan, and including green worker loans, the amount will need to reach 200 billion yuan. However, it is estimated that only about 60 billion yuan in foreign exchange can be recovered after export, which is a huge loss. It is proposed to submit a report to the Ministry of Finance to ask whether it will bear this loss. Resolution: To be decided after submitting a report to the Ministry of Finance. (5) The price issue for purchasing spring silk. The designated purchase price is 29 million per dan. However, details are pending submission to the Guidance Committee for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Appeals to Authorities to Increase Artificial Silk Quota and Lower Allocation Price to Facilitate Production</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau resumed the allocation of rayon on August 4th, allocating half of the amount requested by each manufacturer, and adjusted the allocation price. Silk weavers in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Shengze and other places, after hearing the news, sent representatives to Shanghai to meet with merchants in the city yesterday afternoon to petition the Central Trust Bureau to request an increase in the quota and a reduction in the allocation price. He Molin, manager of the Purchasing and Barter Department, received them, but the negotiations did not yield results.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, more than 30 representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau to visit Director Wu, explaining the current difficulties of the silk weaving industry. If they are not resolved, the factories will be forced to close one after another, and more than 100,000 employees will inevitably lose their jobs. Director Wu was very concerned about this, inquiring in detail about the current situation of the silk weaving industry, and immediately called President Zhang of the National Bank, arranging to visit him at 7:00 PM that evening to discuss a proper solution. A decision on this issue may be reached in the coming days.</p>
<p>Liu Qingyi, executive director of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association, told reporters that the silk weaving industry uses rayon and spun silk as raw materials. After the victory, rayon was shipped from Japan to Shanghai by the Central Trust Bureau exclusively and allocated to various factories. The allocation price was lower than the market price. In June of this year, each box was 9.6 million yuan, while the cost of the Central Trust Bureau was less than 4 million yuan. However, the allocation was stopped after June and has been stopped for more than a month. More than 300 silk weaving factories in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Shengze and other places are mostly only partially operating due to the lack of raw materials and difficulties in exporting, and the situation is very uncertain. Silk weaving factories in Shanghai are therefore discussing the issuance of wage discounts, which is still being mediated by the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee. The Central Trust Bureau resumed allocation from the 4th, but the allocation price has increased to 22.6 million yuan per box. The black market price is 24.6 million yuan, but the allocation requires payment one week in advance. If the interest rate is calculated, the allocation price is already equal to the black market price. Merchants in Suzhou and Hangzhou were shocked when they heard the news and came to Shanghai to discuss requesting a reduction in the allocation price, otherwise they would be unable to maintain operations and would have to close their factories. As for the quota, Shanghai had a total of 2,900 boxes in December last year, but it was reduced to more than 400 boxes in June of this year, which was not enough for allocation, so an increase in the quota was requested.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's rayon market did not change much, and transactions were very quiet. The market opened yesterday with No. 120 Takayama Arikawa at 25 million yuan. The closing price at noon was 5.2 million yuan. The unsold goods from yesterday's allocation were not allocated yesterday, so the holders were still struggling. The closing price was up 200,000 yuan at 5.4 million yuan, up 400,000 yuan from the previous day. The factory Jing yesterday's market was very quiet, and all levels of Gao Sidu lacked transactions, but because the chips were exhausted, the asking prices were all raised by 500,000 yuan. Silk goods and silk quilts opened down. Huaqiang goods were first called at 10.545 million yuan, and finally sold at 530,000 yuan. Dacheng goods were made at a maximum of 580,000 yuan for the spot price, and the closing price was 550,000 yuan. There were very few transactions of checkered crepe, and the asking price was similar to the previous day. The production areas of Sheng Huo Chong electric spinning and foreign spinning reported price increases, the former by 10,000 yuan and the latter by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>This City's Industrial Organizations Establish the Japan Economic Research Association to Review Trade Policy with Japan</h3>
<p>Various national goods organizations in this city, in order to cope with the opening of Sino-Japanese trade, held a meeting of the Japan Economic Research Committee at Jufeng Garden yesterday afternoon. Representatives from various organizations such as the Machine Industry Association, the National Goods Factory United Association, the China Industrial Association, the National Goods Production and Sales Association, and the Production Promotion Association, including Hu Boxiang, Cheng Nianpeng, Tian Heqing, Pan Shihao, and Jin Runyang, totaling dozens of people, attended. It was decided to establish the Japan Economic Research Committee to review trade policy with Japan from the standpoint of private industrialists. It was also decided to dispatch representatives to Jinjing (Beijing) by night train on the evening of the 6th (i.e., tonight) to present three opinions to the central authorities: (1) For detailed items of the opening of Japanese trade, the government should allow the people to participate in the discussion. (2) The selection of representatives for the business inspection delegation to Japan should be fair and impartial, and it must be declared that they will give up trade with Japan. (3) The basic national policy towards Japan must comply with the opinions of the Economic Research Association.

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation: Dumping of Foreign Goods Leads to Factory Closures and Debt Disputes</p>
<p>Editor: A invested in opening a factory in January last year. At first, the business was good, but recently, due to the impact of foreign goods, it closed down with debts and auctioned off some of its assets to repay debts. Friend B has lent money to A several times, agreeing to use machinery, assets, and houses as collateral. C rented the entire factory building from A in November last year for a term of two years, with the monthly rent specified as a percentage of the products. D holds the factory's bounced checks and warehouse receipts and filed a lawsuit in court after the factory closed. May I ask: (1) B's mortgage has not been cleared and he can freely dispose of the factory property, but he knows that the factory has been rented to C. Now he knows that D has come to enforce the valuation and auction first. How should he deal with it? (2) C rented from A in November last year, but the lease was not certified by the court. Is this lease valid? (3) If D has enforced the auction, can C apply for an objection? Will it affect the leasehold right?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] (1) The mortgage has not been cleared, and it is not "free to dispose of." If the mortgage right has been legally established, then "the mortgage right will not be affected by the transfer of the mortgaged property to others, and the exercise of its right of pursuit will not be affected by the auction of the mortgaged property by the court. Therefore, after the mortgaged property is auctioned by the court at the request of ordinary creditors, the mortgagee's failure to request liquidation of the proceeds only results in the loss of this opportunity to claim compensation, and since his mortgage right has not been extinguished, he can exercise the right of pursuit against the auctioneer." (2) The lease contract is also valid even if it is not certified by the court. (3) All stable transfers to third parties, the lease contract still exists for the transferee, and D's execution of the auction does not affect C's leasehold right.</p>

<h3>New Gas Price Not Overcharged</h3>
<p>Reply to Reader Cai Liangzhi</p>
<p>I have received a letter from your Social Service Department, stating that it has received a letter from reader Cai Liangzhi, stating that the Shanghai Gas Company's overcharged price increases the extra burden on users, and requested a reply with the original letter attached. The reason for the adjustment of gas prices this time is initially due to the lifting of the cost of living index, followed by the abolition of central subsidies and the sharp increase in the price of allocated coal. Therefore, the prices of various public utilities have to be increased month by month to balance revenue and expenditure, and the business will not stop. It is not just gas. As for the new prices adjusted by gas several times, it is stipulated that it will start from the date of meter reading. After checking Mr. Cai's bill, the company is handling it in accordance with the regulations and has not overcharged. Corresponding reply, please check and inform. This is to the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau of Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>Tennyson, Poet Laureate of the Victorian Era in England</h3>
<p>— Rolandzi</p>
<p>The literature and art of the Victorian era in England were obviously in an era of peace and prosperity, just like the Elizabethan era. The rise of democracy and the achievements of the industrial revolution gradually introduced a new trend of realism into romantic literature and art.</p>
<p>In the Victorian era, the most accomplished poet was Alfred Tennyson. His poems have been recited everywhere by the British people for nearly 50 years, just like Shakespeare's plays, because he can write the voice of the people into poetry. His poems have become a powerful expression of the people's joy and suffering, just like a member of parliament speaking for the people in parliament, and its power is a hundred times greater. His poems combine the strengths of Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Scott, Byron, etc.! He is a representative of Victorian writers.</p>
<p>Tennyson was born on August 6, 1809, in the residence of the parish priest of "Somersby" in Lincolnshire, England. The natural environment there nurtured the poet's inspiration early on. Tennyson began writing poetry at the age of twelve, and later entered Trinity College of Cambridge University with his brother. In his second year, he wrote a poem that was extremely brilliant and won an honorary medal.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1830, he and Hallam, influenced by Cologne, also ran to the Italian revolutionary party to participate in activities! He marched in the Pyrenees Mountains to resist the Italian Emperor.</p>
<p>In 1831, Tennyson's father died, and the family was poor and could no longer pursue a degree at the university. He stayed at home for six years to concentrate on studying and writing poetry in his spare time.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1832, his close friend Hallam died suddenly. Tennyson was discouraged and rarely wrote for ten years, but his "In Memoriam," written to mourn Hallam, is as famous as his "Idylls of the King."</p>
<p>In 1842, his collection of poems (Poems) was published, and modern narrative poems were also printed in it. After publication, it caused a sensation among the public, and his fame as a poet rose sharply.</p>
<p>In 1847, he published a long poem of three thousand lines, "The Princess," which was very popular.</p>
<p>In 1850, he was elected "Poet Laureate," continuing the title of Wordsworth. In the same year, he married Emily Sellwood, Hallam's sister, whom he had admired for thirteen years. Later, he was summoned and rewarded by Queen Victoria. In 1864, he wrote "Enoch Arden," and his reputation became even greater.</p>
<p>After 1872, he tried drama to explain the difficulties of England's founding and encourage the people's patriotism. He wrote "Queen Mary," "Harold," "Becket," "The Cup," "The May Queen," "Becket," "The Foresters," and other plays. Naturally, he was not as proficient as he was in writing poetry, and his achievements were not as great as Shakespeare's.</p>
<p>On October 6, 1892, he died of illness at his retreat. On the 12th, he was buried in public.</p>
<p>Tennyson's writing style is to speak for the people. His poems are concise and powerful, and have a philosophical meaning. His style is the opposite of that of his contemporary poet Browning, and he will always live in the hearts of most people.</p>
<h3>The Humor of the Violin Virtuoso</h3>
<p>— Qiu Ping</p>
<p>The unprecedented violin virtuoso Paganini (N. Paganini) hired a carriage to perform. The coachman asked him for double the money. Mr. Paganini asked why he wanted double? The coachman said: "Why does your performance cost twice as much as others?" Mr. Paganini said: "I can cut two of the four strings and play. Can you take off half of the wheels?"</p>
<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Li Weichu</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Now, I have learned to be silent. My heart cries in silence, my lips are tightly closed because of silence, and my eyes are watching because of silence. Unspoken words make me deeply understand the meaning of profoundness. I think I will never speak again. If words are vulgar, selfish, cruel, and lose the preciousness of language; if words bring resentment, disaster, and harm, then I would rather shut my mouth forever. The deaf-mute are wise listeners.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>How many times, I hate my sincerity!</p>
<p>When lies are more beautiful than truth,</p>
<p>When falsehoods are sweeter than truth,</p>
<p>I am saddened and even ashamed to tears for my own stupidity and foolishness. At this time, I hate myself! I hate why I can't lie? I hate why I can't be false? At that time, I cursed myself even more!</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>How many times, I even more blamed myself: Why can't you bear it? Why can't you deceive yourself and others? That is obviously not your business, why do you have to argue with others until your face turns red? That coal ball is obviously black, but people say it is white; why can't you admit it?</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>That person is obviously a scumbag, but you think of him as a hero; that person is obviously a well-known hypocrite, but you think of him as a generous and righteous knight; that person is obviously a little almsgiving, but you return it with deep affection; that person is obviously leisure, but you use it with a lifetime of love; what glasses are you wearing? Are your eyes blinded by nobility? Is your soul deceived by holiness? Five years, ten years, the tide goes out, the stones are exposed, and then; you know you are wrong, you regret, resent, but what's the use? Everything has been washed away by mistakes, you should still curse your own stupidity!</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>The wind and rain are beating, roaring, and crying outside the window. The night is quieter than death, and the sound of frogs is like an endless cry. Isn't the wind also bringing the cry of the universe to the world? At this time, in this situation; the soul encounters the deep tranquility of the night, as if it has been baptized by sadness, so it is as clear as water, as clear as a mirror. At this time, you can't forgive yourself for even a little flaw! The only thing that can be respected is wisdom and reason. Emotion is just a dizzy teenager of seventeen or eighteen years old. Although it is innocent, it is so cute, but it is ridiculously naive and stupid. If you understand the deep tranquility and distant meaning of autumn, and at the same time you recall the disasters you caused in the spring, you will understand that in the underworld, people do not welcome the real spring, so everything that belongs to spring; innocence, enthusiasm, straightforwardness, and the real revelation of human nature are not welcomed by people at this time, and are regarded as stupid, naive, and ridiculous...</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>——Then, when is the time when spring is welcomed? When is the time when mankind expresses its whole truth?</p>
<p>I don't know, but our hearts know. Haven't our hearts demanded the same? When this voice in your heart rises again, you will know that this time must not be far away, and it will not be too far away from you. Then you will believe that mankind is not heading towards destruction, but towards light, towards happiness, towards good and evil, just like from night to dawn.</p>
<h3>Love</h3>
<p>— Xu Minghuai</p>
<p>Remember the past years like flowing water, remember the past love like a dream, the tide of memory flows circuitously through the river of the heart, and the beautiful piano sound plays on the strings of the heart...</p>
<p>Remember once standing by the bridge, gazing at the clear sand and water, reflecting the blue sky, milky white clouds, the lush green grass, and the trembling reeds; the fine waves murmuring slightly, and rushing forward affectionately.</p>
<p>Is life always so busy! Is life always so leisurely and quiet!</p>
<p>The answer is a string of smiles like the morning glow</p>
<p>"Ding Dong"! A piece of gravel slid down, breaking the clear water and sky, the ripples are charming whirlpools, rippling, rippling.</p>
<p>It's just a small wave in the process of life, and there are countless waves, big, big, small... in the days to come.</p>
<p>Remember once walking on the outskirts of the city, bathing in the golden waves of light, the gentle dance clothes of the evening wind brushed over; listening to a chorus of frogs, accompanied by the songs of the wind that came quietly and went quietly, watching the clouds floating slowly in the blue sky, and the distant mountains lying leisurely, in the moving mood, drawing a trace of reverie, floating to a distant place - this should be a surreal enjoyment, an unparalleled enjoyment.</p>
<p>Let's go to make a green dream under the green willow tree! Seek the "love in the dream", the warmth of love, and the evergreen of warmth.</p>
<p>Remember once sitting deep in the building, listening to the pattering rain, gently hitting the roof tiles, and the eaves leakage began its ups and downs of playing, from light to heavy, from slow to fast.</p>
<p>Turn on the red bean-like oil lamp, and look at the quiet surroundings of the room, with endless flavors of lovesickness and lingering tenderness. Leaning together, reading the poems of the philosophers, making subtle murmurs, listening to the even ups and downs of breathing, the gentle beating of the pulse, and the silent exchange of heart electricity. Let the boundless night go on! There is no longer a lonely self in the world.</p>
<p>Remember once rowing in the heart of the lake, the lights on the lake, wandering in the vast night fog, blinking drowsily, a trace of crescent light, gently sifted down the lake, the stars smiling in the ripples, the yachts playfully kissed on the sparkling scales, and a clear song sounded in my ears:</p>
<p>Eyes flow</p>
<p>Half shy</p>
<p>Flowery demon</p>
<p>Willow-like tenderness</p>
<p>Infinite pain</p>
<p>In the heart</p>
<p>A light smile</p>
<p>Forget my worries...</p>
<p>The sound of oars is accompanied by the singing, the singing harmonizes with the sound of oars, the singing, the sound of oars, shaking the cool lake water at night, shaking the cool moonlit night, is a symphony with a beautiful melody and sonorous tone, is a string of beautiful spring dreams that are ethereal and distant.</p>
<p>Remember countless good times, countless dreams, endless songs, poems, endless poetic feelings, love!</p>
<p>Love is a glass of orange drunk wine, exuding a rich fragrance; love is a petite and exquisite bud, pregnant with infinite vitality; is a beautiful rainbow after the rain, hanging over the long sky; is the first spring thunder before "awakening of insects", passing over the layers of clouds; is the music lingering in the heart, is a colorful picture, is the laughter of the heart, the exchange of youth!</p>
<p>Cherish laughter, cherish youth, do not let cunning steps steal the precious years, let the colorful piano sound slip away, the fiery love, the buds in the heart, bloom a scarlet flower in the golden days.</p>
<h3>Swallow</h3>
<p>— Minzi</p>
<p>As early as spring, the swallows put on a dazzling coat of purplish-brown and came from the other side of the ocean.</p>
<p>They spoke cheerful words, and in the beams, they used their own saliva and mud to build a warm nest. It seemed that I had never heard them say love words. I don't know when this pair of distant lovers laid eggs, and I don't know when they hatched the swallows. The swallows put their tender yellow mouths on the edge of the nest, and cried like that.</p>
<p>The old swallows no longer seemed to have the leisure to sing so happily in the beams. They put all their divine power on the younger generation. They flew to the fields, catching dragonflies, butterflies and other small insects to feed their children. Seeing the father or mother coming back with something in their mouths, the swallows opened their yellow mouths and clamored.</p>
<p>The old swallows staying by the nest carefully watched over their children, fearing that snakes and mice sneaking from the beams would take them away. Sometimes, the old swallows used their mouths to peck off the mud and dead cars stuck to the swallows, or combed their feathers that were not yet full... What a delicate care and noble love!</p>
<p>For the continuation of life, they are breeding their offspring. In order to cultivate their offspring, they have exhausted their efforts!</p>
<p>Now, the swallows' feathers have become full under hard feeding. They can fly with the old swallows in the clear blue sky, and they have also learned to catch flying insects. So the old swallows murmured in the beams again. This is a song of joy, their efforts have been rewarded.</p>
<p>When autumn came, they returned to the south. The old swallows were swallowed by the giant waves when they crossed the ocean because of the depletion of their divine power. Only those young and strong children flew back.</p>
<p>The fate of the old swallows is certainly sad, but the greatest comfort can be found from those later generations who are stronger than themselves.</p>

<h3>"Guiyang Bridge"</h3>
<p>— Lu Lian</p>
<p>The color of this bridge is really fresh, it is bright red. Red like fire, and like blood. How many people standing at the head of the bridge are not constantly laughing at the bottom of their hearts? This is really ingenious. The person who painted this bridge must have a lot of experience and have seen a lot of green grass and flowers. How can the name be so special? In the bustling metropolis of the southeast, it is named after a city in Guizhou Province. This is a bit strange, maybe the other side is the underworld, who knows, there are many mysterious things in the world. So no matter what, don't cross it, people should be careful. Let's stand on this bridge, rest, and if no one accompanies you, there are clouds and water, which is not considered lonely. There are trees on the bridge. What, there are trees on the bridge? I don't believe it. Ah, it is the unruly trees growing on the shore. What does this mean? One of its branches passed through the bridge railing, understand? Speaking of the railing, the railing is also a bit strange. This is not wood, wood will not be so thin, so is this lead wire? It doesn't look like it very much. Look around, your eyes can't just stay in front of you. The surroundings are full of trees. Trees, trees, all trees. There is grass, the grass is too chaotic, who is in charge of this place, so unruly. Huh, how come there is a rainbow on the right side, no, I said it wrong, it is red, a red line. Not too big or too small, like a bridge but not a bridge, what is this place? Go and see, you must not miss the opportunity to broaden your eyes. Don't go forward, how dare you guarantee that the other side of Guiyang Bridge is not the underworld? Right side, right side, go back the same way. ...Ah, it's still a bridge. The bridge name is still Guiyang Bridge. There are several kinds of small birds on the head, the small birds are comfortable, they sing so happily. My companion called me on the bridge where I just stood. Annoying, I walk slowly, and I have to exploit other people's time to walk the bridge. Ask him: Why is Guiyang Bridge called Guiyang? "I don't know," so simply, I don't like this kind of straightforwardness, it spoils other people's interest and makes a fool of myself, it is better not to say anything. What's wrong, urging me to hurry? Okay, raising your legs will leave ten miles behind. If it weren't for the sake of Guiyang Bridge, I would be angry with you.</p>
<h3>Beethoven's Poverty and Death</h3>
<p>— Oriental Mist</p>
<p>At the end of November 1826, Beethoven suffered from a meningitis cold and fell ill in Vienna. After being ill for several months and undergoing several operations, the money was used up. He had no choice but to write to the London Music Society and Micesels in England in early March (1827), asking them to try their best to organize a concert to help him. The Music Society immediately sent him 100 pounds as an advance payment. He was very grateful for this matter. "It was a heartbreaking sight," said a friend who was present at the time, "to see him receive the letter, clasp his hands together, and moan with joy and gratitude." In gratitude, his wound reopened. And he also wanted to dictate a letter of thanks to those "noble Englishmen who sympathize with my miserable fate"; he promised to write a work for them: the tenth symphony, or an overture, whatever they pleased. "I have never," he said, "undertaken a work with so much, as I am writing this work." The letter was written on March 18, but on the 26th of the same month, in a snowstorm, our generation of "Music Saint" died.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>However, there was one small thing that left him with some resentment. You see, Yaoqun had bought him a pair of new leather shoes. These shoes had been personally inspected by Yaoqun, so of course they were flawless. The leather was a loose, yellowish color, with a subtle sheen, exactly like the ones worn by foreign devils and Chinese university students, lacking nothing at all. Furthermore, although Little Tiger was joining the formal army, there were no restrictions on officers' attire, so Yaoqun had also gotten him a set of military uniforms, a military cap, and an ordinary golden collar badge. Yaoqun thought that he might occasionally need to attend banquets or group appearances, so Little Tiger had to have a set of presentable clothing. In addition, there was, of course, a bit of encouraging intention behind it. This whole set of luggage, in this "returning in glory" performance, if actually worn in its entirety, how glorious it would be to see his mother, his sixth uncle, his maternal great-uncle, and the many elders, peers, and subordinates in the village? But on the day of the troop withdrawal from Beiping, Yaoqun had hidden this beautiful outfit, leaving only the pair of leather shoes.</p>
<p>This time, going back to the old village, even though they had that "Pass" as a talisman, they could encounter countless checkpoints along the way, with inspections that could turn everything inside out. So, the two only wore their original clothes, with a few changes of clothes packed into two small bundles. Even the new leather shoes, only worn once or twice, were left behind in Beiping because they didn't match their clothes. This one point, just this one point, made Little Tiger feel greatly disappointed. Every time he thought about it, he had to grit his teeth and glare. But when he thought about how he had already become a "squad leader" and the secret mission of this trip, he threw this worry aside.</p>
<p>When the car arrived in Pan Yang, Yaoqun thought that there would be a lot of trouble, so he had warned Little Tiger many times to be especially careful, cautious, and patient, and not to say a word if possible, so as not to cause trouble and delay the main purpose. However, as soon as the car entered the station, the two felt something different, unlike the previous situation. The first thing was the calmness, an unusual calmness. Usually, there would be various strange shouts as soon as they got off the car. People getting off the car would have to line up on the platform, inspect their luggage, interrogate their origin and destination, and check "Border Crossing Permits," "Identity Cards," "Passes," "Vaccination Certificates," "Protection Certificates,"... If there was any doubt, they would not only get slapped in the face, but also have to provide a guarantor.</p>
<p>This time, the two got off the car, each with a small bundle in their hand, and had already placed all kinds of documents within reach. But the platform was quiet and orderly, and there was no such thing as lining up. No one came to interrogate them; they could leave the station as soon as they got off. At the station entrance, there was only a ticket collector and two traffic police officers performing their ticket collection duties. There were no other troubles. This was truly beyond the expectations of the two.</p>
<p>Yaoqun felt this was strange, but he couldn't ask about it, and didn't want to stir up trouble. As soon as they left the station, he glanced around and got into a taxi, giving the driver a place name.</p>
<p>It was only a little after seven in the afternoon. Usually, along the streets this car passed, although not very lively at this time, there would still be people coming and going in a constant stream. But Yaoqun and Little Tiger, sitting in the car, didn't see many people walking. Some of the shops along the street had already closed their doors, and some were busy closing. This scene, as Yaoqun saw it, was like a mystery. Little Tiger had, of course, also seen this, and wanted to say something several times, but Yaoqun stopped him.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the designated location, in front of a hostel, as soon as the car stopped, they saw a person who looked like a receptionist rushing down the steps to greet them. Little Tiger, who had been feeling stifled for more than thirty hours, wanted to move around a bit. He smiled, raised his hand, and gave the person who came to greet him a warm gesture. Upon seeing this, the person seemed a bit surprised and only nodded slightly.</p>
<h3>Please Contribute Generously</h3>
<p>— Taisheng</p>
<p>Another appeal for the families of martyred journalists</p>
<p>After this magazine published an article by Mr. Wang Dian on behalf of the Zhu Xinggong family, the Jialin Scholarship Board generously donated one million yuan and requested this newspaper to launch a fundraising campaign for journalists who died during the war of resistance, providing generous pensions.</p>
<p>Since this newspaper published the donation announcement, donations from all sides have been very enthusiastic, showing that society is willing to contribute generously to the families of loyal and martyred journalists.</p>
<p>The situation of Shanghai journalists fighting against the enemy puppet regime during the enemy puppet period is difficult for those who have not experienced it firsthand to imagine. At that time, enemy puppet scouts were everywhere, explosions occurred around various newspaper offices, hand grenades, sulfur bombs, and shrapnel flames were flying, and thugs from "76th" were lurking around the newspaper offices, waiting for an opportunity to attack journalists. At that time, the lives of journalists were in as much danger as fighting on the front lines.</p>
<p>However, the "paper bullets" full of fighting spirit, resilience, and unyieldingness still selflessly and loyally shone and shot at the shameless and despicable enemy puppets, letting them know that although Shanghai had become an isolated island, the banner of justice was still fluttering in the sky of Shanghai; although the national army had withdrawn westward, Shanghai journalists, using "pen barrels" instead of "gun barrels", were still leading all Shanghai citizens in defending the motherland!</p>
<p>Zhu Jinggong, Zhang Sixu, Cheng Zhenzhang, Li Junying, Jin Huating, Shao Xubai..., and other martyred journalists, in order to defend the motherland and promote justice, they fell under the banners of the motherland, in a pool of splendid and glorious blood... Their loyalty is touching, and their bravery can be a model for journalists.</p>
<p>Victory has been two years, but the lives of the families of martyred journalists are not guaranteed. Shanghai citizens who love the motherland and journalists hope to contribute generously, so as to accumulate contributions and distribute them to the families of martyred journalists, in order to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, this magazine will publish the sacrifices of martyred journalists one after another. I hope you will understand and participate in this great event!</p>

<h3>Letter from America</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhengming</p>
<p>Although any discussions in America about the Wedemeyer mission to China are still somewhat speculative, it is becoming increasingly clear that those in power in Washington have decided to provide assistance to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and Wedemeyer's trip to China is reportedly to uncover evidence that can serve as a basis for "revising" American policy. The State Department's view, if it can be called a view, is this: After Marshall returned home and personally submitted a report on China that blamed "both sides," Truman could not legitimately modify policy without the activities of another "fact-finding" mission, although no one believes that Wedemeyer can add anything to the reports and analysis already received by the State Department from various personnel in China.</p>
<p>The plan for Wedemeyer to include Korea in his itinerary, a State Department bigwig told me, is just "a reference" and has no major significance.</p>
<p>Aid to Korea Plan Shelved</p>
<p>Before this matter is announced, the State Department will first declare - if various current plans can mature - that they will not, in any case, ask Congress to approve any aid to Korea this year. It is said that their statement will explain to Korea that they have decided to incorporate Korea into the entire global economic aid program at the next congressional meeting. And the date of the congressional meeting, unless Truman convenes a special session this autumn, will probably be held in January next year, giving the Koreans a bitter pill with a sugar coating.</p>
<p>The reason why the plan to aid Korea was abandoned is this:</p>
<p>Republican congressional leaders told State Department officials at the last minute that they had no hope of obtaining $78 million to aid Korea this year. Senator Vandenberg has flatly refused to agree to announce this policy through his Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Eaton, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the State Department that he was willing to bring this case up for discussion, but no action could be taken on it during the 1947 session of Congress, because congressmen are generally terrified of the topic of foreign aid. Joe Martin told the State Department the same thing. The $137 million allocated by the Department of the Army to Korea for "internal administration functions" will include some reconstruction funds, but not much, because most of it will be used for occupation costs and food relief.</p>
<p>America shields Japan</p>
<p>Because Japan is where the United States wants to spend the most money to support this old enemy, the United States is obviously making the most effort and is treating it as the top priority in promoting Japan's economic recovery. Whether right or wrong, most American officials now hold the old view of the British that the Japanese are the only people in the East who can do business well. In addition, there is currently a desire to establish some kind of anti-Soviet fortress in the Far East, and the Japanese are in a key location and can be the United States' temporary favorite.</p>
<p>Now that the Soviet Union has indicated that it intends to boycott the preliminary meeting of the Japanese peace treaty in August, the world clearly sees that a hopeless deadlock is finally unavoidable. Washington's current belief is that the United States will insist on leading the holding of the Japanese peace conference, whether the Soviet Union participates or not, because if it yields, it will be said to be some kind of retreat, and Marshall has said that he will not take this kind of retreat.</p>
<p>Lamenting the Indonesian War</p>
<p>The State Department is devoutly praying for the poor Indonesians and the Viet Minh government of Vietnam every night, but it doesn't seem to be able to do anything effective. Today they are expressing their pain over the Dutch re-launching the war against the Indonesians, but tomorrow they may issue a wonderful and ridiculous little notice expressing "regret" over the outbreak of the conflict, but there will be no other action.</p>
<p>The Netherlands obtained materials under wartime agreement conditions, and the lend-lease materials obtained at that time are now being used to fight the Indonesians, and the United States has reason to take them back. However, Washington officials say that if the United States wants to exercise the right of retrieval, it will cause too much trouble. For the sake of our American money, it doesn't seem harmful to try it, and we should notify the Netherlands that we will no longer give them Export-Import Bank loans or other financial assistance until they really know that they are living in the twentieth century. The same should be done for the French in Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Guanyin Attainment</h3>
<p>— Lu Shi</p>
<p>The nineteenth day of the sixth lunar month is the Buddhist holy day of Guanyin's attainment. Due to legends turned into dramas, the performances on Great Fragrant Mountain have made some people deeply believe that Guanyin Bodhisattva is the third daughter of King Miaozhuang. At the same time, because the images sculpted in the temples are generally female, it further confirms that the Great Master achieved Buddhahood as a woman.</p>
<p>In fact, the Buddhist doctrine holds that the four elements are empty and there is no form, so where does the distinction between male and female come from? As for the sculpting of female images and the myth of King Miaozhuang, it is a symbol and not a fact.</p>
<p>Originally, Buddha Sakyamuni was born in the dark ages of ancient India and witnessed the heavy karmic obstacles of that time. He was extremely sad about his view of life, and he was willing to give up the nobility of the crown prince and enter the mountains to seek enlightenment, hoping to transcend the world and save himself. Later, he was greatly enlightened and realized that saving himself by escaping the world was still a small self, so he resolved to enter the world to save others and complete the great self. The so-called saving oneself by escaping the world is Tathagata, and saving others by entering the world is Bodhisattva. In other words, Tathagata takes negative emptiness as the highest ideal, and Guanyin takes compassion and salvation as a sacred mission.</p>
<p>The Buddha Dharma is vast and boundless, planting causes according to circumstances and proving fruits according to sounds, so it is said that the Buddha has billions of incarnations. Wonderful Form Tathagata is one of the Buddha's incarnations. The Chinese character for 'wonderful' is composed of 'young' and 'woman'. The heart of a young woman is the most compassionate, so the Bodhisattva uses a young woman as a symbol. White clothes indicate purity, and purple bamboo represents spiritual communication. Guanshiyin from Purple Bamboo Spirit Mountain is the Buddha, and the Buddha is King Miaozhuang. The three are one, and there is no so-called father-daughter relationship.</p>
<p>Good men and believing women, if only you have compassionate hearts, promote your spirit of universal love, and grasp your pure beliefs, the Western Paradise is close at hand. The Pure Land exists in your heart, so why must you pilgrimage to famous mountains to cultivate yourself!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Every country has its own unique customs and human feelings. Although the British and Americans belong to the same ancestry, their lifestyles are sometimes so different that it is hard to believe. Even in terms of clothing alone, there are huge differences. The British like to wear shorts, but Americans absolutely do not wear short suit pants. You can't find anyone wearing shorts and walking boldly on the streets in the United States. They have a very obscene interpretation of people wearing shorts, so people who go to America from England or India have to treasure their short suit pants to avoid being laughed at. Even in the summer, despite short-sleeved shirts, the pants are always long. The clothes worn by women in the summer are simply unbelievably thin. Those that are more cumbersome wear long pants and mesh shirts, and those that go a step further wear short white drill pants, just like the Chinese old-fashioned apron. Some simply wear bras and triangular pants connected into one piece. This kind of seductive clothing is most common in the southern provinces, and less common in large cities like New York. American women almost never wear socks in the summer. First, nylon socks are not easy to buy, and second, wearing socks does not contribute to beauty at all. So sock shops are deserted in the summer. Smart exporters learned that Chinese women have a sock-wearing habit and are willing to pay the highest price, so they smuggled all the nylon socks at a price of one yuan per pair to Shanghai to sell at a high price. Most of those silk socks are large sizes, suitable for American women, and it always feels inappropriate to put them on the small legs of Chinese women. American women have a habit of wearing flowers, but because fresh flowers are not easy to buy, they use paper flowers to decorate. The women in New York, in particular, wear them brightly, just like the court attire of the Manchus. Each of their hair is piled up like Princess Iron Fan in "Si Lang Visits His Mother." (36)</p>
<h3>What Should the New Currency Be Called?</h3>
<p>— Yu Jing</p>
<p>The rumor of issuing "Sun Coins" has been around for a long time, but it has never become a reality. The relevant authorities have repeatedly stated that this is not the case, but it will certainly not be groundless. After this war, inflation has soared like a kite, making it difficult to control. Reorganizing the currency is inevitable, but the timing is not yet ripe, and the authorities are cautious and unwilling to prematurely cause adverse effects. Recently, General Wedemeyer came to China and it has been rumored that he will assist our country in reorganizing its finances and reforming its monetary system. Semi-official sources have even revealed that it may be implemented within the year, which shows that the time is not far away!</p>
<p>What will the new currency be called? This is a very interesting question and must be of concern to many people, serving as a topic of conversation over tea and wine. If the name of the new currency is really the rumored "Sun Coin," then the government, in order to praise virtue and reward merit, and to remind the people to remember the great achievements of the national father in leading the revolutionary martyrs to establish the country with difficulty, adopting the national father's surname as the name of the new currency is originally well-intentioned and beyond reproach; however, if we can make the name of the new currency contain more meaning and be more practical, it is still desirable!</p>
<p>If we could know in detail the origin of the names of the currencies of various countries in the world, it would be extremely interesting. Some are just evolved from simple village dialects, some are rich in mythological meaning, and naturally there are also those that use the surnames of emperors or great men, without any fixed rules. However, within the irregularity, there is a new naming rule that is worthy of our reference; that is, the name of the standard currency is evolved from the name of the country, which may be more meaningful and solemn when circulated internationally.</p>
<p>Anyone who pays a little attention to international common sense probably knows that the currency of Bolivia is called Boliva, and before Lithuania and Latvia joined the Soviet Union, their currencies were also called Lit and Lat, respectively. Some people may think that these are small countries and are not enough to be examples. But everyone should not forget that the currency of the French Republic (Frabce) is called the France (France). They are all derived by removing or slightly changing the tail of the country name, which seems to give people a very clear and solemn impression.</p>
<p>In English, China is called China, in French it is called Chine, and the Japanese call us 支那 (Shina), all of which are evolved from the Qin sound. It can be seen that more than 2,000 years ago, the Qin Dynasty's institutions, martial arts, and imperial achievements were enough to be respected by all countries in the world. If I suggest that we name our new currency standard 鎭 (China), it would probably be enough to explain the demeanor of a great ancient country in China without being humble to the honor of being one of the four powers!</p>
<p>It clearly tells those who hold it that this is a Chinese (China) currency, and the side of the character "金" (gold) also tells people that it is omnipotent money and also indicates that it is adopting the gold standard. I think it is undoubtedly the case that our country will adopt the gold standard after reorganizing its monetary system.</p>
<p>"鎮" is a new character, just created by me, but I think everything is changing with each passing day, and it is no longer an era where the Kangxi Dictionary can explain everything.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Atomic City (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Binzhi</p>
<p>—— Tannu Tuva ——</p>
<p>Tannu Tuva has become a secret den of the Soviet Union. But from newspapers, magazines and government bulletins, between the lines, a little secret can be found. In this vast desert wilderness, there were originally only more than 70,000 people leading a nomadic life. But as Maxwellov said in Soviet Review: the number of Soviets has increased sharply there, and the natives are gradually being Sovietized. From Plaisidim's words, it has gradually become electrified. The entire territory is divided into seventeen electrified districts and four cities. Judging by common sense, there would not be so many villages on the nomadic grasslands. This shows the rapid increase in population, and perhaps the number of Soviets has exceeded the number of natives.</p>
<p>Another passage says that the rivers and lakes of Tannu Tuva have been dredged for many years, and steamships can now travel back and forth there. This inevitably raises the question of how the steamships and riverside machinery were transported? Of course, there are only two ways: land and water. If they are transported by land, it shows that the Soviet railway construction has been secretly expanded to its hinterland. If they are transported by water, it proves that the navigation of the Yenisei River has been successful. From the diaries of scientists, we can see the frequent traffic of cars, which indicates that the highways in Tannu Tuva are also well-connected.</p>
<p>The agricultural development of Tannu Tuva is unknown. However, there are not many workers planting grains on 15 million acres of land. It can be inferred that it must use large-scale mechanized farming like the Soviet Union next to it. At the same time, coal and hydropower are used to match the power stations.</p>
<p>The Soviet government attaches great importance to Tannu Tuva, spending countless money and manpower to develop and build it. In 1946, at least 32 large-scale research institutes were established there, and five scientific expeditions were engaged in mineral resource surveys. If the Soviet Union has an atomic city, it must be in Tannu Tuva.</p>
<p>From these brief fragments, I have obtained a little bit of information, barely drawing a rough outline of the Soviet atomic city - Tannu Tuva. But there is no way to know more unless the Soviet Union opens his mysterious curtains.</p>
<p>Water Margin Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Baozheng</h3>
<p>— Aizhu</p>
<p>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Chao Gai was known as Baozheng. Baozheng, needless to say, is equivalent to the current Baozhang (village head). The Song Dynasty followed the previous dynasties, and Lizheng (ward chief) was set up in the countryside. It was said that a Lizheng would definitely lose money, and the most difficult task was to take turns serving in the local government office, called Yaqian (government servant). Later, the task was exempted, and rural households were used instead. The Lizheng was only in charge of collecting taxes, so it was hard on some wealthy farmers in the countryside, and the Lizheng was no longer a hard job. During the reign of Emperor Shenzong, Wang Anshi implemented the exemption from service law, changing service to recruitment. The people paid a sum of exemption from service money, and should no longer serve. However, after the implementation of the Baojia (household registration) system, Baozheng replaced the original duties of Lizheng. Wang Anshi's plan was to save money. The heavier the duties of the Baojia, the fewer the various services hired by the government could be reduced. Therefore, at that time, Baozheng was responsible for clearing household registrations, capturing thieves, collecting taxes, and training strong men. This situation became more and more serious in the Southern Song Dynasty, and various duties piled up on the Baozheng. For example, sending and receiving palaces, repairing bridges, mending roads, and sending official documents. In addition, superiors had to pay a meeting fee, and after serving, they had to pay a dismissal fee, which was no less difficult than the Lizheng in the early Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>According to the situation of Chao Gai described in Water Margin, it seems that he was quite influential in the countryside before becoming Baozheng. That must have been the situation in the Northern Song Dynasty. If it were in the Southern Song Dynasty, people with more money would not serve this hard job, especially a local tyrant like Chao Gai who had a wide range of acquaintances. Therefore, this also shows that it is a story handed down from the Northern Song Dynasty.</p>
