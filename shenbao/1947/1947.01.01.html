<h3>除舊布新欣逢元旦　主席告全國同胞　憲法公布完成憲政夙願</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕蔣主席於卅一日下午八時向向全國同胞發表「卅六年元旦吿全國同胞廣播銅」，全文如次：</p>
<p>全國同胞：　今天是中華民國卅六年開國紀念日，是抗戰勝利，國民政府還都以後第一度的元旦。年年此日，我們追念國父革命開國的宏規及締造民國艱難的史蹟，省察國家當前的實況，　望民族光明之前途，每一個人　有興奮惕勵的心情，來迎　　一國歲首令節·但是今年更有一點要特別紀念的，就是我們國民大會已經制定了中華民國憲法，規定了施行日期和準備順序。國民政府今天公佈這一部憲法，於全國完成了多年來實施憲政的夙願，實現了國父和革命先烈的遺志，這一部憲法，是經過無數艱難歷盡千國百折，始得召開國民大會而制成的·憲法的內容，兼顧到理想和現實，對於國內各民族漢，滿，蒙，回，藏及國內其他各民族的一律平等，各政黨在法律上一律平等，以及人民權利自由的積極保障，都有確切的規定。這一部憲法的精神，是蓄萃全國各方面的意見，根據政治協商會議所定的原則，可以說這一部憲法實施的成敗，就是我們中國能否實行民主的考騐，也就決定了國家安危興替的前途·從此民主自由，已經是不空洞的口號，而要我全國同胞認眞的行使民權，善盡義務，如期促成憲法的施行，以策國家的長治久安。這是民國成立以來一件劃時代的大事，本席要特別宣吿於我同胞，向全體同胞表示慶幸的。</p>
<p>關於抗戰勝利以後，這一年來國家所遭遇到現實的困難和人民身受的痛苦，我們政府無時無刻無不引爲本身的責任，盡心竭慮的設法解決，從未加以忽視的。但是有一點重要的意義，必須提示我全體同胞的，就是我們目前正在由大戰之後面渡入復員善後的時期，正由戰爭破壞而四進入駿後建畫的時期，世界上任何國家如果這受　如此　暴的侵略，經過了八年以來如此長久艱苦的抗戰，其不能立即恢復戰前的狀　；是事理所必然而　以避免的。何况我們中國在抗戰以前，本是一個建國未成百事落後的國家，經過這樣長期的抗戰苦鬥，人口的傷亡轉徒，物質的消耗枯竭，經濟基礎的動搖，財政狀况的支絀，農村和都市的殘破，生產和消費的脫節，以及敎育文化輿社會道德餘備受摧殘，比之基礎充實的其他國家，常然不可以同日而語。我在抗戰期間，屢次對我們同胞表示，抗戰建國的決心，是要從廢墟之中建設起一個究整無比的三民主義富張康樂的新中國，這當然不是一年半載以內所能辦到的事。我們今日所痛惜而慚愧的，祇是在抗戰以後，還要遭受國內許多不應有破壞和阻撓，但是同胞們要知道，國家是我們四億五千萬人所共有的國家，而且時代是在飛躍進步，而不容許我們因循延誤苟且生存的。過去一年的蹉跎，我們不必再去追溯了，從今天起，不論政府人民都要除舊布新四個字來努力，而且要共同一致日新又新的來努力。我們現在就要實行憲政，人民是國家的主體，今後國家的機運完全繫於今日全國的人民，所以政府固然不應該諉棄戰責，人民也要善盡對於國家的義務。我在今天要以下列幾點，提示於我們全國同胞：</p>
<h3>憲政促進會　下月可成立</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕憲政實施促進委會組織辦法，聞下月初可望公布，現正洽商中，下月內當可成立。</p>
<h3>政府盡最大忍耐　求致統一與和平</h3>
<p>第一，我首先要吿訴我們同胞，政府對於維護和平統一的方針，是決不變更的·我們中國不統一，便不能生存，不統一便不能復興，政府當然要保障國家統一與社會安寗，也有責任保護人民生命財產的安全，但是統一的實現，必須以和平方法來覓取。去年一年之間，政府對於求致和平停止衝突的苦心與忍讓，是國人所共見的，我們盟邦友人馬歇爾將軍，道一年來的努力，不僅協助我們完成遣送三百萬日俘日僑與接收失地恢復主權的工作，更以其超越常人的忍耐，多方促成我們的和平與統一·這種純潔公正的友誼，是値得我們全國感動的。現在憲法旣已頒布，國家就要迅速進入民主憲政的坦途，我們即將擴大政府的基礎，延攬各黨派與無黨派人士共同參加，依照政協決定的和平建國綱領，來策進政治的實施，加强政治的效能。中國共產黨雖然拒絕了參加國民大會，放棄了他對於建國的職責，但是政府對於共產黨問題的處理，我可以簡單說明，仍然要一秉以政治方法解決，政治間題的方針，如果有任何機會使政府的政治解決能够實現，政府決不放棄那種機會，政府所希望於共產黨的，祇是希望其誠意實現已經成立的各種協議，實行停止衝突，遵守三人會議所成立的恢復父通與整編統編的旣定方案，不再作武力奪取政權的企圖，使國家得到和平建設的機會，使刦後餘生的同胞，不再感受破壞和平的痛苦與威脅。除此而外別無所求，政府決不關閉和平商談之門，而且還期待共產黨參加政府，因循民主的正軌，實施政協約決鐵。至於爲推行憲政，完成復員，進行建設，解除民衆痛苦，以及其他爲任何政府必須負責應做的事，政府亦決不因與共產黨談判未獲結果，而任其延緩·總之，政府一方面要盡最大的努力，以實現民主與憲政，同時也必盡其最大可能的忍耐，以求致鐵一與和予，這是股府今晨的主要方針，首先要明吿於我們全國　同胞的。</p>
<h3>願我全国同胞　矯正變態惡習</h3>
<p>第二，願我全國同胞矯正戰後變態的惡習，抗戰勝利以來農村凋敝，交通梗阻，都市人口听見增加，都市社會顯現了變態的繁荣，都市風氣而暴露了無窮的缺點，我們國內一般都市最普還嚴危險的現象，就是民族道德完全淪喪。就工商來說，正常營業岌岌不保，而投機冒險的行爲，日甚一日，或偸稅走私，或欺詐弋利，旦夕之間，可以立致鉅富，輾轉仿效，相習成風，高利貸的盛行和物價的彼動，都是這類暴利游資所造成，影響所及，人人以不勞而獲爲萬能，養成了苟且徼倖的心理，以致禮義廉恥掃地無餘，道是一，就一般風氣來說，窮奢極侈，漫無節制，巧取豪奪，相習成風，篤實被認爲迂腐，自愛被譏爲落伍，投機取巧的風氣，由都市而波及於一般社會，爲了欺騙無知的民衆，不惜顚倒黑白，混淆是非，來達到他個人不可吿人的目的。利己不恤損人，甚至不恤於禍國，這是二。就勞資現狀來說，我們戰前建設基礎，已極薄弱，民族工業本極幼稚，經此戰事備受傷殘，乃復員以來，勞資合作的良好關係，又被都市自私自利的潮流所激盪所摧毀，交侵互奪，糾紛日起，工業前途隱憂未已，如果勞資雙方祗顧片面的利益，不能精誠合作，維護此一絲僅屬的產業的生命，一旦工廠倒閉，經濟破產，不但勞資同歸於盡，而且生產停頓，勢必影響整個社會的生存，那末我們經濟基礎在戰時倖免於敵人的毀滅，在戰後反而自己來摧殘，豈不成爲抗戰的罪人，這是三。</p>
<h3>應以奢侈頹靡為大恥　投機取巧為萬惡　希望我同胞建立新風氣</h3>
<p>總之道德的淪喪，精神的墮落，任何國家任何時代，沒有像我們戰後今日都市社會中所暴露的現象，這種現象，實在不是八年舌戰獲得勝利的國民所應有。我說到這裏，不但覺得痛心，實在爲我們國家寒心，都市本來是文化經濟優秀精華之所萃，應該作內地鄕村的表率，而且關係國際的觀瞻，而現在的情形如此，我們國家那得不受人譏笑，受人輕侮呢？這種現象的造成，實際田於淪陷期間敵僞奴化影響的殘留，但也有人以爲是內亂不止的影響，國內不得和平統一，因而經濟不能穩定，生活無法安定，社會人心就無由得到安心立命的寄託。不論原因如何，我總希望我們都市同胞，尤其是工商文化界的領袖，要以身作則力挽頹風，務必以奢侈頹靡爲大恥，以投機取巧爲萬惡，互相規勸，共同策勵，建立我國建國的新風氣。在此人慾橫流，社會浮動的時候，人人都應有挽回狂瀾的決心，移風易俗的精神，來矯正這種可恥可悲的惡習。我們決不能以國內變亂一時的現象而喪氣，反之二正應該以內亂危機的存在而戒愼堅定，自重自愛。我們要想到我們抗戰英勇的成就，以日本這樣强大的敵人，入寇我國八年之久，我們終於把他擊潰，那末現在抗戰已經勝利，外患已經消除，如果我們國民能够人人發揮我們民族的固有道德，負責任，守木分，明禮義，知廉恥，端正人心，發揚正氣，有前進的目標，有向上的勇氣，則自强不息，撥亂致治，必易如反掌。正所謂「事在人爲」，無論任何阻力決不能妨礙我們民族復興，亦不能阻止我們完成建設國家的共同大業。</p>
<h3>青年應明是非　不可爲人搖惑</h3>
<p>第三，願我全國靑年，重視建國大業的貢獻。靑年學子是國家繼起的主人，也是民族安危存亡所託命，國遝的隆替，全看靑年的抱負和靑年的作爲。我們抗戰八年，入學靑年的數額歲歲增加，人材輩出、這是國家的最好現象，但是我默察現在的知識靑年，往往對環境過於敏感，對現實過於苛求，對自身缺乏定力，對前途缺乏信心，因此很容易被別有作用的政客野心家所煽惑，所操縱，受了他們的宣傳，中了他們的誘惑，有的爲不滿現狀而趨於消沉，有的對政治失　而流於偏激，不論如何，都是國家莫太的損朱，其實在過去這一年中間，政府爲謀取和平容忍　　，　了怎么樣的程度，而在八年抗臘之後，我國正在勞力復　　　的時候，究竟是誰便我刦後同　重受這樣痛苦·悲慘·流賺·傷亡。空前未有的慘却，事實所在，至爲分明·現在國民大會業已圖滿閉幕，憲法已經制定頒佈，敦府有否一黨專政把持獨裁的企圖，更可能昭然大白。我在今天要特別提醒我們全國的靑年，你們切不可再爲有作用的宣傳所搖惑，而自誤其平生。國父在世時，嘗對我們革命靑年說，靑年們立志革命，必先要「明是非別利書」，我們今天決定是非與利害的標準是很淸楚的，凡是積極進取而有助於國家建設的，我們就要予以擁護，反之，凡是破壞社會擾亂國家要促使我們民族倒退的，我們就要予以反對，這不是很簡單明際的事嗎？靑年子弟們，你們要特別愛惜靑年時代的光陰，要珍重你們難得而易逝的時間，切不可蹉跎歲月，等到老大傷悲。你們要知道，中國今日饅迫切的需要，無過於建設，要提高同胞的生活，在於建設，要克服經濟的困難，在於建設，要消弭失業的痛苦，在於建設，要鞏固國家的基礎要保特勝利的成果，也在於建設。我們戰前的建設計劃和僅有的建設成績，經八年多的抗戰，是被躭擱了，是被破壞了，現在杭戰勝利，不平等倏約已經廢除。一切障礙建設的因素可以說完全應清了。而且現在正是第二次世界大戰之後，盟邦各國多願意積極幫助我們復興和建設，我們如何可以放棄乘這個千載一時難得易失的良機。</p>
<h3>拋棄過去空想選定真正道路</h3>
<p>我在四年以前，不平等條約廢除的時候，在「中國之命運」一書中，曾經擬訂了戰後十年建設計劃的統計表，祇就高級幹部人手說，就需要大學畢業生五十五萬人，我願大家再看一看這個統計表，便知道我國建設前途的偉大和貢戲機會的無窮了。你們有豐富的知識，有大好的年華，有强健的體力，爲什麼要徬徨於煩悶憤慨之中，要消耗於空洞無當的政治鬥爭之內，而不貢戲於建國的大業，爲全國同胞創造實際的福利呢？靑年們必須知道，中國如果長此搗亂破壞，你們身受其害爲最多，如果安定進步，你們將來垢享受的榮譽和幸福也最大，你們正在盛年，對國家民族要認識自己的責任，要有絕對的信心，要確信我們抗戰勝利以後建國成功是必然的，無論任何搗亂，亦不能阻碍我們建設的大業，而且建設成功以後，我們中國的前途必然是十分光明的。你們有了信心而後能正視事實，而後能忍耐刻苦，而後能齊心協力，爲明白的中國而奮鬬。靑年們，拋棄你們的空想，選定你們自身應走眞正的道路而前進，這才無負你們的生平。</p>
<h3>共同精誠合作　奠定長治久安</h3>
<p>我全國同胞們，我們過去的一年，可以說是憂患重重的一年，也可以說是坐誤良機的一年。我們看一看世界上有多少同我們比肩作戰的國家，現在已經整理善後，完成他們的復興。我們更要看一看物質基礎比我們豐厚的若千盟邦，在戰我盤十以後，還在管制消費厲行節約，更有多少國家，在那裏鼓動動勢增加生產，以彌補戰時的損失，造成戰後的繁業，甚至有許多戰敗國家，也都在竭力掙扎以圖生存和發屬。我們以彼例此，旣不能厲行節的，又不能努力生產，甚而至於國內秩序，還不能得到普遍的安定，大廠一念及此，廠　如何奮發努力，知恥自强，當此歲序更始，我竭誠希望同　們，以除舊布新的決心，作共同一致的努力，我們的憲法已經頒布，民主憲政在一年以內即將施行，和平統一的實現，已有了共同遵微的途徑，祗要六家　　合作，負責盡　　，奠立我們長治久安的基礎。推進我們三民主義建設的工作，則我們中華民國的前途，必然是光芒萬丈的，我以至誠祝賀我們全國同胞的新年幸福！（完）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>歡迎民主憲政年的開始　—民國三十六年元旦獻辭</h3>
<p>今天是中華民國三十六年的元旦，也就是我國最偉大的民主的建國紀念日；中華民國的新憲法，經蔣主席簽署之後，又於今天隆重頒佈了，使中華民族的民主建國史，到此告一段落；從今天起，開始步入真正的民主憲政的新時代。所以我們在民國三十六年歲首之時，回顧前瞻，即可證明三十六年以來的民國史，是從衰亡到復興，從黑暗到光明的一個最重要的時期。現在這一頁新歷史正在寫下去，我們應該接受民國以來所遭　的一切痛苦的教訓，并應當加強我人關革命與抗戰的過程中所經驗得來的信心，從今年起，從今天起，為實施黨政而共同努力，以達到民主建國的最後成功。</p>
<p>我們認為辛亥革命與八年抗戰以及今天的建國，絕對是一件事，辛亥革命是根據國父的三民主義的理想而來，八年抗戰是民族自衛本能的發動，今天的建國更是出於人民希冀建設一個獨立自主新民國的願望。所以在過程上雖可分為苦命，抗戰，建國；但在實際上絕對是一件事，抗戰與建國實為辛亥革命的的延長，同時我人瘮認為，民主建國的真正困難，還是在自己本身，而不在外界。回首三十六年以來的民國史，民元年今日，由國父手植的建國　石，僅及一年多，就開始動搖，民四年就發生洪　之變；從民五年以後的十年，軍閥混亂，南北對畤，欲求統一而不可得；其後幸賴蔣度席領導國民革命軍北伐，不二年即使中國統一於國民政府之下，到如今已近二十一年了。在此期間，一則由於國民黨內部意志的分歧，以致數度發生變故；另則因中共在江西設立蘇維埃政府，企圖以武力爭取政權，紛爭了十年，始入好轉之境，但外患接踵而起，終於演成全面抗戰。幸賴我國軍長英勇抗戰，八年如一日，最後獲得了我國歷史上空前未有的勝利，使我國的國際地位，由次殖民地一躍而為五強之一；但是勝利之果不久就開始腐爛，全國人民的情緒，也由狂歡而驚愕，而歏息，而煩悶了。</p>
<p>現在回首往事，民國卅六年以來，國家幾乎天天在驚濤駭浪之中，所蘭有一個鞏固強大的中心力量，代表民族國家的利益，為生存而奮門始能轉危為安，化險為夷，最後卒能克服所面臨的任何難關。即以勝利後和國內局勢而論：在日軍投降之後，國共問題接踵而來，共軍不僅到處與政府「爭降」，而且在各地破壞交通，使復員與接收的工作不能展開；其後中共甘為戎首，公然以武力擴充地盤，爭城奪地，以致引起萬惡的戰亂，烽火由華北而東北而蘇北，燃燒了半個中國。政府深知人民渴望和平的迫切雖一再與中共進行和談，并曾更番頒佈停戰命令，但是始終未能獲致國內和平，就是在慶祝元旦慶祝新憲法并紀念辛亥革命的今天，各地的戰亂，在中共採取攻勢之下，仍未稍止。這種局勢的嚴重，實在不堪想像。同時又因為戰亂的不停止，全國交通公阻塞，工商凋敝，物價高漲，民不聊生，使中華民國又連逢到一重空前的難關，其嚴重性甚至越過抗戰期間。</p>
<p>但是政府在蔣主席的領導之下，充分表現出盡其在我的精神，不論環境如何困難，仍按步就班，向着「政治民主化」與「軍隊國家化」兩大目標邁進，國民大會雖徇黨派的要求，一再延期，但終於在去年十一月下旬開幕，完成了制黨的偉業，新憲法的內容，雖非盡善盡美，但有遠大的理想，且能顧全現實，可以說是綜合全國各黨派的意見而制成的，英美輿論界無不予以好評，今天由國民政府隆重頒佈，凡是真正愛國家愛民族的人民，都應該熱烈慶祝，祝其成為中華民國四萬萬人民共同遵行的法典，祝其促進中國真能步入和平民主的新時代。</p>
<p>所以民國三十六年是我國的民主憲政年，我們站在這一年的歲首，瞻望中華民國的前程，　特建國必成的信念益堅，而且眼前充滿了希望的光明。惟「作事慎於謀始」，我們對於這民主憲政年的開始，更應加倍努力，格外謹慎。行憲的國大代表要在今年選舉，第一任總統也要在今年產生，這一年有關民主建國的前途，是何等的密切呀！我們但願三十五年的戰亂苦難璧如昨日死，而三十六年的和平民主就從今日生。最後，我們敬祝民主憲政年的成功！</p>

<h3>原子能委會報告書通過　美獲重大道義勝利　巴魯克稱實現管制原子之日尚遙　今後發展取決於安理會</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖卅日電〕聯合國原子能委員會今日以十票通過報告書草案後，美代表巴魯克即該草案之起草者表示該報告書之通過，為一道義上之勝利，惟以蘇聯對其中若干部份猶持反對，故料去實現禁止原子武器之日猶相當遙遠。巴魯克復謂下一階段將為由安全理事會起草管制原子能之國際公約，該約將逐章詳細討論，各國均可盡量提出反對之意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖卅日電〕聯合國機構原子能委員會今日開會，雖遭蘇聯強烈反對，卒以十票對零票之絕大多數通過美國原子能管制方案，并即移送安全理事會討論，但仍有遭蘇聯否決可能，美國方案之最後形式，係列入委員會臨時報告書，表決時，蘇聯與波蘭棄權，中國·英國及荷蘭熱烈贊成，法國代表柏洛第宣稱：彼於此案之實質方面表示同意，但願將懲戒該約一節中不得行使「否決權」字樣跚去。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯雖未投票，但對美國方案曾猛烈攻擊，預示蘇聯或將在安全理事會運用否決權，打銷此項報告，或至少將規定五大國對於懲處破壞原子能管制協定之國家應放棄否決權一節，予以打銷。波蘭代表蘭琪曾公開表示此種憂慮，謂彼之放棄投票，即因感覺此項報告書內含有五常任理事國所不能接受之規定。美國　竭力爭取對於懲處破壞原子管制法典之國家不得使用否決權一節，報告書長八十九頁，已為美國主張國際管制及監察之完備制度建立基礎，所有全部問題均列入報告書，由原子能委員會全體會議，逐節通過，除關於否決權之規定曾有劇烈爭執外，在全體委員十二名中，至少有十名全部予以贊成，美代表巴魯克曾決心要求將不得行使「否決權」字樣特別列入，以此提付表決。報告書大體依照巴氏六月十四日之提案主張旅行國際管制及監察制度，協定要點如下：（一）禁止製造，保存或使用原子兵器；（二）現存原子兵器應加以處置；（三）規定實施監察之完全自由；（四）設立機構，以促進交換有關原子能之基本智識；（五）特別規定構成國際罪行之破壞行動，及招待懲處之方法；（六）嚴重之破壞行動須立即報告該協定簽字國家，聯合國大會及聯合國機夠安全理事會；（七）不準運用否決權，以袒護故意違犯協定者。葛羅米柯此次復用英語學說，拒絕美國對於原子能管制取消否決權之要求，建議將此方案逐項討論。據稱：此為原子能委員會最緊急之會議，蘇聯政府認為必須將美國草案中所有之缺點除去云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社河內卅一日電〕此間總督府及火車站附近，昨夜遭越盟軍隊砲火轟擊，略受損失，但并無死傷，今晨拂曉，法軍砲兵向海塘越盟軍陣地回擊。同時亦出動飛機向之轟炸。順化方面越盟軍續以堅強壓力加諸該城。其他各地戰事平靜。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎卅日電〕「巴黎晚報」發表海外部長慕台在越南之談話，謂法國準備談判解決越南事件，但法國在考慮對越盟之政治協議細則以前，意欲確保其在越南軍民之安全。法國對於任何建議或有裨解決之檢討，從未加以拒絕。</p>

<h3>蒙帥蘇聯之行　用意極為深長　英軍界人士精闢見解</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦卅日電〕關於英國陸軍總參謀長蒙哥馬利元帥聘問莫斯科一事，英國軍界人士對於蒙帥行前是否舉行參謀部會議，旣不予以證實，亦不加否認。據消息靈通人士談稱：蒙帥此行目的，乃在研究對於運輸及供應專家羅勃斯及加特遜二將軍前往莫斯科一行。若研究軍略問題，則將請求其最得力之助手，改空軍軍略家辛普生將軍同行。聞蒙帥此行之主要目的，乃在緩和工黨內部之裂痕，以及反對貝文外相所采取之外交政策者。按蒙帥曾在美國，加拿大奧地利三國相繼發表談話之後，外界乃盛傳英美兩國將締結軍事同盟，致使英國反對貝文外相之政策者日多，故蒙帥自奧地利返國之後，即記起蘇聯元首史丹林元帥前在波茨坦會議時曾邀請其前往蘇聯一行，準此而論，蒙帥作莫斯科之行，實出於其本身之發動云。</p>

<p>「在過去一年內，各方均深信日本社會制度有長足之進展，此項進展係沿於最進步及自由之途徑，且以機會均等及人身自由之觀念為依歸，從而提高人民之尊嚴，福利及歡愉。在一九四六年內，吾人所完成者孔多，仍有待完成者亦屬不少。一九四六年可稱為改革年，代表人民之日本政府已組具規模，日人亦已獲得自由生活之權利與機會。日本領袖多能獻身於解決日本問題之工作，多數日人亦有拋棄已往并締造較佳未來之決心。來年日本之一切更將影響今後下世代間日人之福利。新憲法將於來年生效，土地改革亦將相繼施行，日人亦將有運用自身意志選舉新領袖之機會。改革及自由將永垂不朽，抑亟待解決之問題，此項問題將左或將成為曇花之一現，此端賴日人自行決定。日人現正面臨諾多右目前日本之一切，且將影響日本之未來。日人將瞭解并堅執此項機會，堅決對付各項問題，此即為余之祝辭與余之堅定不移之願望。日本復端賴於斯，日人未來和平及幸福之機會亦有賴於斯，遠東人民爭取文明之希望亦有賴於斯。」</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦卅日電〕傳蘇聯於明年三月之莫斯科外長會議中，擬支持德國建立聯邦制之建議此間消息靈通之外交界人士聞後，深感驚異。蘇聯關於德國問題最近一次之聲明，即為十二月初向紐約外長曾所撼之下國外長會議議程，德國未來行政問題，被列入議程中之第二項，迄至目前為止，一般皆料蘇聯於論及德國之政體問題時，將贊助設立中央政府，消息靈通方面相信此事實際上當係程度問題，故蘇聯雖將支持聯邦制度，但亦不致反對中央行政制度之設立。預料外長會議論及此問題時，將確定中央與地方政府之權限，及何時應設立中央政府。不宜設立中央政府制之主要因素，即為各佔領區政黨意見之懸殊。</p>

<h3>高院傳訊影人　衹見梅熹到庭　偵訊半小時　交保二千萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨高檢處傳訊第四批附逆影劇人張善現，陳雲裳，梅熹等九名。直至上午十時二十分，僅有「春江遺恨」男主角梅熹一人到庭。梅戴咖啡色舊呢禮帽，頸圍花方格圍巾，穿一件褪色的藍布套袍，着一雙黑毡鴨舌鞋，長方的面型，略有風塵之色。</p>
<p>在檢察官未傳訊之前，梅熹在記者面前滔滔不絕的發表了很多的意見和感想。他說：「前三次未遵傳到案的原因，是在九江籌辦了一家「蔭園」電影院，專演國產影片，從九江回上海繼五天。這次的檢舉是應該的，有罪無　，應該弄明白。他加入「華影」是由於原在「中聯」，「華影」係由「中聯」改組而成，原有賞合同仍舊有效，故繼續為「華影」工作，過去拍了很多片子，惟成為問題的是「春江遺恨」一部。該片是岳楓導演，劇本也是經過岳楓修改，在拍「春江遺恨」之先，日本曾拿出五個劇本，要求我們拍攝，均經拒絕，倘再不拍此片，則「華影」有被敵全部接收可能。張善琨為勸我們拍攝此片，曾說願意寫字據給我們，保證由他一人負責，可是我們和張的關係太深了，不願要他寫字據。梅熹亦承認「春江遺恨」是反英美的歷史劇，違反抗戰國策，但稱實為環境所迫。據他說岳楓大槪在東北，張善琨陳雲裳則仍避居香港。他偵訊後誓不返九江，在滬聽候高　處消息。</p>
<p>十時五十分傳入訊問，約歷三十分鐘，檢察官論交二千萬元　保，隨傳隨到。他走出來的時候，為了怕被攝影，把呢帽壓至　下，後面一個法警跟着他去找保，看那晃蕩晃蕩的舊藍布袍的背影，為這認識不清意志不堅的沒落的藝人感到一些悲哀。</p>

<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>願大家發揮服務精神</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>一元復始，萬象更新，卅五年度匆匆消逝，卅六年度應運而來，吾人於此歲首，充滿無限希望，願進一言，與我親愛的讀者共勉。</p>
<p>「人生以服務為目的」，這句至理名言，誰都懂得，也誰都會說，因此大家反把「服務」二字，看得平淡無奇，其結果卻把它輕輕的放過。服務，服務，徒成口頭禪，成為有名　實的幌子！</p>
<p>服務不必好高騖遠，不必高深理論，只須正視現實，虛心接受；隨時隨地，身體力行；有一分力，做一分事；不計酬報，不辭勞怨；不分疆關界，不損人利已；並須勇往直前，久而　堅，總是「服務」的真諦。</p>
<p>貝登堡首創童子軍，他所定的願詞：一曰盡國民的責任，二曰隨時隨地扶助他人；三曰遵守童子軍規律。這三條似乎尋常習見，卑不足論，然而細細體驗一下，那一條不含有服務的意義？所以受過童子軍訓練而真能終生奉行的話，他總是「社會服務」的實行家。</p>
<p>勝利後的中國政爭未已，一切未入正軌，民生愈形憔悴，萬方多難，目擊心傷！但我人不可灰心，不可消極，大家抱同甘共苦同舟共濟的心理，為大眾謀福利，為人羣而服務。本欄同人，心餘力薄，愧無建樹，願　一得之見，盡其最大的努力，尚望諸諸君，隨時督教，以觀後效。</p>
<h3>駐平美軍污辱女生事件　本市各校學生表示抗議</h3>
<p>駐平美軍污辱北大女生事件發生後，我北平市府即向美軍當局嚴重抗議，並提出四項要求：（一）肇事兇犯應在中國迅速公開審判懲處；（二）美方當局向被害人道歉·慰問並賠償被害人身體·名譽·精神等一切損失；（三）保證今後不再有類此事件發生；（四）當地美軍當局，應與中國當局求得更密切合作，以維護中美傳統友誼。美軍當局，對上述各點，表示一俟被拘兩美兵審判完竣，罪證確立後，即可全部接受，並深致歉忱，預料此一不幸事件，駐平美軍當局必能於最短期內依法處理，迅謀合理解決。</p>
<p>法學院昨照常上課</p>
<p>此事發生以後，北平學生界激於義憤，罷課游行，以示抗議，本市學生界，亦同表憤慨，惟除曁南·交通·復旦·上海法學院等樣，響應罷課外，餘均採取沉着鎮靜態度，蓋多數學生，　認此事雖為一極大不幸，但究係出於一二　兵之個人違法行動，純屬法律問題，與現有駐華美軍之去留問題，無直接關係，殊不必過分誇張，以致影響中美國之傳統友誼，故多數學校學生，除表示憤惱或發表宣言，抗議美軍暴行外，並不採取罷課遊行等行動。前日罷課之上海法學院，昨已復課，曁南·復旦·交通等學校，昨雖繼續罷課，但今日為元旦令節，各校均於今日起放假三天，假滿後即將準備舉行學期考試，故四日起罷課各校當可照常上課。</p>
<p>曁大復課發生衝突</p>
<p>此次本市若干學校採取罷課行動，離係有一二教授預事策動，借題發揮，以遂其政治宣傳之目的，如首先實行罷課之曁大，原已決定於昨日復課，並於昨晨八時照常上課，但於上課時，有少數學生鼓噪焗動，繼續罷課，致發生衝突數次，當有反對罷課之學生譚立言·潘榮　·但家瑞三名，先後被毆受傷，譚等已決依法起訴。該校訊導處職員潘星照及若干同學且被押至大禮堂「公審」，訓導長王應三，因掩護被毆學生，亦遭嚴辱，直至下午三時許，被押同學始被釋放，秩序漸趨恢復。</p>
<p>各校擁護學總宣言</p>
<p>本市學生總會，前晚曾為抗議美軍暴行，發表吿全市同學書，續請政府向美軍鄭重抗議，同時反對罷課逃行。此項態度，極獲本市學生界之擁護。茲悉大同·法政學院·同德醫學院等校學生自治會，紛起表示，擁護學總宣言。</p>
<p>大同大學學生，為抗議北平美軍暴行，特召開該校自治會常務理事會，決定基本態度兩點：一，發動全校同學聯名抗議，二，決不採取罷課手段。會後即由該會常務理事林季平·倪文泂·陳光德·聯名張貼佈吿，說明採取上項態度之理由，並提出對政府的具體要求抗議，二，懲辦肇禍美軍，三，保證以後不再有類似事件發生。全校同學對自治會之決議，一致擁護。</p>
<p>上海法政學院學生自治會，昨致函學生總會，對該會宣言表示贊同。</p>
<p>周德醫學院級聯會，昨日召開緊急會議，一致通過下列各點：（一）對美兵暴行事，請政府提出嚴重抗議，（二）同情被害同學並致電慰問，（三）要求美方道歉，賠償，並保證以後不再發生同樣事件，（四）擁護學生總會對該事件之宣言，（五）嚴防陰謀份子從中利用，擴大事態；（六）堅決反對罷課遊行，影響同學學業，該項決議，全校同學均表擁護。</p>
<p>上海商學院昨日下午三時舉行全體學生大會，到三百餘人，　經決議：「在不罷課之原則下，與各校同學採取一致行動。」</p>

<h3>領事簽證之貨品　并不保證可以進口　未獲許可證即將貸品起運　發生損害應由進口商負責</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會執行委員會，以外界對輸入貨品一節，仍多不明之寫，昨特發表聲明，略稱：關於輸入貨品一節，本年十二月初，本會會已函請外交部重咨中國駐外各領事館，按照前例繼續簽發領事簽證。但簽發領事簽證，並不保證該項物品，於攤口時可獲許可。茲據各方報吿，駐外領館仍有數次未照電令辦理，本會業已再函外交部促其注意。</p>
<p>又該會同日通吿各進口商，略稱：案查修正進出口貿易暫行辦法第二條規定，凡輸入貨品，除禁止進口類，及屬於第十四條規定者外，概須申請輸入許可證。在未取得上項輸入許可證前，進口商逕將貨品起運，因而發生損害時，應自負責任云。</p>
<p>又該會執委會秘書處處長陳長桐，近因公務繁忙，特加聘中國銀行赴外稽核余英傑襄佐處務。余氏刻已自美返滬，今後將常川留處辦公云。</p>
<p>輸管會負責者語記者：該會對於已申請各進口商之審核工作，業於本週開始審核之步驟，以限額配售重要進口之油，橡皮等爲先，然後循序辦理，惟此項審核工作，係依據當時指定之二十九家銀行信用狀對各進口商進口貨數字表爲標準，目下各銀行，正値年終結算之時，故對此項信用狀進口商數字表格，送會者爲數頗少，是故審核工作，未能積極推　，希望各指定銀行方面，以及各有關機關，予以通力合作，則此項審核工作，於短期內，即可順利進行。</p>
<h3>進口商訂貸减少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）關係方面消息：由於進口許可制度之實行，近來我國進口商在美之訂貨，大部爲二千美元以下之小額訂貨，大宗訂購者尙少。進出口業人士表示：以現勢觀察，今年內美國之來貨，當以必需之工業原料爲主體，成品所佔之比例將减少。關於日貨輪華事，該業人士認爲今年日本之工業全部復工，生產品激增，其成本低糜之口用品，勢必大量輪入南洋及我國之市塲。尤以我國目前棉紗棉布之貨少價高，及請求美應之困難，將來日貨之輸入，事實上恐難沁防上。至於英國來貸，目前數量尙少，蓋由於英國物資缺乏之故，惟其大規模之出口計劃，將來對我國亦有影饗。又悉，自美國海員罷工解決後來華之船隻將絡繹不絕。</p>
<h3>紗市挺秀</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益形挺秀，蓋配紗調整售價，已正式公佈，廿支紗每件較前提高廿二萬五千元之多，人心因此振奮不少。同時一般廠號頭寸亦已軋齊，皆不願放售，故廿支又漲三萬至五萬，四十二支綫好十萬之譜。客帮買胃亦轉濃，申新三廠曾拋出特別好做三百餘件，價開二百卅萬，一月六日交割，紗號及客帮俱可吸進。</p>
<h3>政儲收購棉紗　今日開始實行</h3>
<p>政府爲穩定紗價，所訂收購棉紗之辦法，自今日開始實行，將在上海市區內收購紗廠所產棉紗之百分之五十。此事業經宋院長指定紡管會辨理，並已開始着手進行收購程序，草擬計劃，該會於昨日下午舉行內部會議，討論本年度工作計劃，並商如何擴大機構，增加工作人員。至收購棉紗辦法細則，正在草擾中。又本市各紗廠今日元旦休假，故實際收購日期，將自明日開始。</p>
<h3>大批紗布運往厦粵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局海抗輪，昨日駛厦門，運去棉紗九十件，疋頭二百六十六件，高梁子三百二十五包，豆餅入百塊，又行總藥品一百八十八件，又延　輪昨駛粵，有棉紗一千零三十餘件，疋頭九百七十餘件，亦有有行總藥品二百零八箱，運往廣東。</p>
<h3>小額工商貸款　共三百〇八家　總額約七十億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕各商業行莊承貸之小額工商貸款總額，迄目前爲止，已達六，九九四，五〇〇，〇〇〇元。中央銀行轉貼現之數額，亦已叢四，九二五，二五〇，〇〇〇元·潤時，已牧圖之數額，已　一，〇九五，七五〇，〇〇〇元，獲得貸款各業，共達一一一百〇八家。此中棉織業共佔八十四家，貸款共一，九〇二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元佔首位。其次爲鐵工業，共佔三十八家，貸款七六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。再次爲針織集，共佔四十家，貸款七六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇元</p>
<h3>銀錢各業　今起休假三天</h3>
<p>今日爲卅六年元旦，本市銀錢各業，大小市塲，均循例休假二天至三天不等，期滿後即行復市，昨日各業市塲，買戶踵接，現貨去化活絡，市勢多被做高云。</p>
<h3>糖價續緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市大都均係開關交款，故價稍見提高，公會劃盤現貨中砂白，初爲十五萬元，後爲十四萬八九千元，廿九期棧單十三萬三千元至十二萬九千元，生砂赤十三萬五千元至七千元，六千元，五千元，四千元，廿九期棧單十一萬五千元，七千元，六千元，五千元，順德靑高十一萬萬九千元，數百包，汕提靑呌十二萬五千元，興化白十六萬二千元，興赤十五萬二三千元，刁靑開十二萬五千元次　赤十三萬元。</p>
<h3>中蠺公司發表　上年絲綢供應概況</h3>
<p>頃據中國蠶絲公司發表消息：該公司除於上年度五六兩月運往美國紐約生絲九百包外（現已銷售八百四十包），其他售與各洋行運鎖印度委託開利洋行運往法國里昂寄售及在滬陸續銷售各綢廠用者，截至十一月底，共計運銷生絲一，九八九包，絹絲部份供應外銷及在滬舊與各綢廠用戶者，截至上年度十一月底止計銷售</p>

<h3>米市客性頗堅　生油疲而者復振</h3>
<p>今日米市南北共到一萬一千餘石，歲暮聲中，供求兩稀，惟產區堅挺，客性頗堅，南北粳均叵漲一二千元，白元亦昂千餘元，陰元隨之上升二千元，秈米則仍少正式做開，雜糧亦以新年休業，貨主甚堅，均呈挺秀，豆油廠方供應照常，價格鮮有變化，淸油亦少榮辱，蔴油漢口蚌埠續到，消化平正，亦無軒輊，惟生油到貨略稀，店胃尙殷，疲而復振，桶生油轉昂三四千元，屢生油未開，黃豆汕頭合灣略有問津，本街零化尙活，續升五六百一百元豆餅亦因閩汕均有納胃、再升百元，惟廠方供源　聯，不數過漲，赤豆到消兩平，熱居站局，蠶豆來去兩少，市勢平庸，苞米穩固，芝蔴南洋去化尙可，價格步砌，繼見盤升千元，生仁廣帮收吸頗濃，逐見高翔，繼續挺升二三千元，麵粉零化活潑，價漲五百元，惟麩皮胃呆，下挫一二百元。</p>
<h3>年關勉強渡過　金市買風復熾</h3>
<p>烚赤昨逢幾末，全臘界以及紗布帮之納胃見股，且央行暗售見懈，終以堅離之曆結束，晨開三三五萬，即吿爭買，紗布帮及金融性之　餘資金咸進，不久即升至三四八萬，同豐餘代客曾有供給，並因登記配給關係，買戶見依而圖小至三三六萬，始復轉定，十時後，央行以三四〇萬之價，配給一百條有零，入後貿戶再股，央行却無供給，高價升至三五一萬，午刻略平，在三四六萬至三四八萬之間徘徊，午後即交再迫三五〇意圖，結果較前收漲起十五萬，飾金揶升至卅七萬，銀元小挫，晴拆以銀根業已舒齊，暗息不過一角半光量。</p>
<p>外匯因港申電　升，再形鬆動，港匯一一八〇元買，一一五〇元買，印　一四〇〇元至一四三〇元，英匯一八五〇〇元至一八八〇〇元，除港匯外，均少出入，美鈔暗市微挺，晨初六千二至六千四，後升爲六千三至六千五，結果較前收微升一百元，港票自一一五〇元升至一二〇〇元外，結果亦稍吿微升。</p>
<p>公債昨統丙晨聞一四〇〇元，自一三八〇元起，逐步扳高至一五五〇元以上，良以六〇四室納胃見健也，結果與前收相較，計甲乙升一百五十元，統丙回漲一百元，統丁圓好三十元，統戊亦升八十元，成交的四百萬元。</p>
<p>華股昨並無正式交易，塲外喊價僅永紗有所做開，金市之見昂，高價聞升爲六四五元以上，低價降至六三〇元以內，全屬現貨交割，交易極不普遍，準確成份極少，至於外股人心因金價見高，均屬有買無資。</p>
<h3>進出口業登記　展期六天截止</h3>
<p>進出口業同業公會周秘書經爲昨日向記者表示：該業自舉辦會員登記以來，截至目前止，已有一百四十家，惟尙有甚多新　之進出口行，未能趕及於昨日截止前登記，紛紛要求展援，爲接受同業意見，及謀擴大組織起見，擬於四日起展緩六天，至一月十日爲最後截止登記期。</p>

<h3>洋莊茶市活絡</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，昨雖値國曆大除夕，而抽珍珍眉等綠茶，若干家出口行，爲速趕船期起見，對於不足之數額，猶在紛紛彌補，見以交易不餒，售價亦甚穩秀，他若高檔陳祁門，英商仁記洋行，仍有悅胃，惜給價慳吝，致吐納談判之結果，續趨僵持狀態。據法商永興洋行消息，刻下非洲加薩勃萊加一帶，需要華茶極殷，惟以運輸及售價等關係，故外銷尙屬滯鈍，但聞目前該行正在向彼方當局積極疏通，如能順利，明春恐有相當出口。</p>
<h3>東北之豆餅　交換台糖茶葉</h3>
<p>據悉東北遼寗省政府，日前曾函台省當局，願以該產之豆餅肥料，交換台灣食糖茶葉，據台省當局意見，以爲如豆餅運台成本及費用等，合計不逾市價，則此項以貨易貨交易可以成立云。</p>
<h3>茶葉衣出口商　盼行貼補辦法</h3>
<p>據　：戰後因　　之不纏　，而使出口物資經營困婦，並　我國一國而已世界各國中，　此個影者，尙有多　，惟各該國家，大多已由政府實華貼補政策，　數月前，美方會需要大批麥芽糖，向捷克訂購，而　克商人計算與國市塲價格，每單位將虧本十分之二，因之無法輸出，旋美方有向南美洲採辦訊，捷克政府不　坐視鉅頗外匯將吿數業，乃與商人治商，由政府補　一　半，廠方貼一成之三，經手人貼一成之二，補足虧耗部份，完成交易，如目前我國茶葉出口商之請求政府收購，亦無非欲求政府之貼補，又如現腸衣業亦亟盼政府給予補貼，以便恢復戰前之生產量，因該業受國際市塲價格低落影　，爲求减低生產成本，對鮮猪腸之收價，抑制未能提高，致收貨已感减少，蓋以猪腸價格原隨鮮肉價而升降，若一旦鮮肉價格在漲，其腸衣勢必售給食戶，而一不再售與腸廠，斯時廠方將整個一停頓，故業中人對政府之貼補，認爲乃外匯之補救政策。</p>
<h3>江浙絲廠原料不繼　將於月初停工</h3>
<p>頃據絲業界鉅子對記者稱：本年度江浙　絲企業，極度衰落，目下兩省所有一百零五家絲廠，除由中蠶公司核准代繅春季另烘　二十五廠外，浙江方面，僅存福華絲業公司所屬各廠，及江蘇永泰絲廠一部份，尙能維持至明年二月底，其餘各廠，均因原料吿罄，將於一月初旬停工。</p>
<h3>台灣七種雜糧　禁止出省外</h3>
<p>合灣省禁止米穀及其他食糧出口，曾規定有案，現當局據報，最近各地倚有私運米粉出省情事，影響本省糧價殊鉅，爲確定其他食糧之範圍起見，特重申禁令，並規定麵，麵粉，豆類，米粉乾，蕃　，蕃薯乾，蕃薯粉等七種副糧，禁止輸運出省，如有私運出口者，與走私米穀一律依照非常時期遠反糧食管理治罪暫行條例之規定，從重處罰云。</p>
<h3>津金融界組銀團　貸款挽救工商危機　總額一百七十億元北平佔五十億</h3>
<p>津市金融界爲挽救工商業之危機，特於日前籌組聯合貸款銀團，經數日之商議，決籌款一百七十億元，對工商業作普遍之貸放，並鑒於北平工商業之興衰，與津市有連帶關係，特撥給五十億，本市決分配一百二十億，至各行莊認貸數額及詳細辦法正擬訂中，預計明年元月，可能開始辦理云。</p>
<h3>美商業週刊論　我國絲業復員</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三十日電〕據官報「國外商業週刊」稱：受戰爭破壞之中國絲業，已有顯著之復原。一九四六年長江流域之生絲產貴可達二〇，〇〇〇至三〇、，〇〇〇担（每担合一三又三分之一磅），其中一五，〇〇〇担或可供出田之用。四州一區亦有長足進步，該處所有戰時使用之資本與勞力，業已予以利用·廣東絲業之復原亦甚迅速，其生絲總產量可能達到二〇〇，〇〇〇至二五，〇〇〇担，其中半數供國內消費之用，其餘則供輸出。財部所屬中央信託局已奉命收購全部蠶絲產量。據傅當局將對農民貸款，以恢復桑園及開辦改良製種塲·由盟軍總部設法自日本輸入之蠶卵三百萬公分，對於恢復絲業頗多帮助·　同時中　方面亦已設法自日本獲得大批乾繭。</p>

<h3>新年唯一新希望　早日實行憲法　增加教育經費　今年中央教育費增至三千餘億</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三十一日電〕明日為卅六年元旦，特於辭歲之際，　導教育方面一個新消息，亦就是一個喜訊：卅六年度國家總預算中，教育經費之增加，使教育工作人員獲得莫大安慰。查卅五年度教育經常費為一〇八億元，卅六年度將增至二六六億元。臨時費（即事業費）卅五年度為三〇〇億元，卅六年度為一·六〇〇億元，共增加二·五〇二億元，較卅五年度約增加三倍。卅六年度國家總支出約為九萬三千二百億，則教育經費僅佔國家總支出百分之四弱，核與憲法第一百六十四條「在中央不得少於預算總額百分之十五，在省不得少於其預算總額百分之二十五，在市縣不得少於其預算總額百分之三十五」之規定，相差尚鉅。明日新年，國府正式公布憲法，全國教育界新年唯一之新希望，在於公布憲法之後，早日實行憲法，使教育經費，得以增加。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕大專足球聯賽，昨日下午二時半一場，同濟戰約翰，裁判楊誠烈，在　旦球場角逐，雙方勢均力敵，各有千秋，上半時鴨蛋一隻，下半時同濟攻勢頻頻，首開紀錄，後因求勝太切，後陣空虛，約翰奪回一城，旋同濟被　十二碼，亦得十二項機會，扳為平手，結果二比二各局。</p>
<p>未開紀錄</p>
<p>笛聲響處，同濟錢允慶，玲　　　，帶球　　，深入腹地，奈缺乏接應，功虧一簣，後陳尊昌巧妙盤球，連遇三關，陳學樂趕上一　，楣角飛出，又失一機，陳尊昌再度進攻，陳少振接住猛射，約翰球門　成，倒身撲球未獲，碰柱彈回，形勢險極。約翰諸德輝見勢不佳，屢次反攻，唯許爾茲手腳不靈，一再失球。雙方你來我往，混戰一場，終無所獲，上半時結果零比零。</p>
<p>同濟先中</p>
<p>易陣再戰，同濟攻勢益緊，陳尊　，脫兔一般，帶球直達黃龍，順勢一撥，首建奇功，聲勢大　同濟乃將本戰前調，致後　空虛，為約翰方託去所乘，扳成平手。</p>
<p>約翰佔先</p>

<p>攻成平手</p>

<h3>淸江牛頭山漢晉古墓發掘記</h3>
<p>— 鹿江廿四日訊　益民</p>
<p>古墓的現　在洪羊時代，就彼鄉人　做古　，而成了避難的安樂窩，一　　　　元先住考證以後，這才引起了許多　古學者的重視！</p>
<p>崔四郞</p>
<p>一個古墓碑拓片　（益民寄）</p>
<p>漢晋古墓發現的消息，傳出以後，〔中央社南昌電申報十二月九日第一版新聞〕許多關心古物的學者和有考古癖的人，都被引起了注意，記者於二十二日下午，特走訪發現人　惠元——一真——先生，在一間佈置得十分考究的房間裏，他娓娓的談述着發現古墓的經過，饒先生是一個藝術家，執教於省立樟樹中學有十年的歷史，早歲畢業於滬上新華藝專，除了對西洋藝術有精湛的造詣以外，教餘對金石和考古都有濃厚的興趣，這次漢晋古墓的發現，的確是值得報導的一個珍貴的考據資料。</p>
<h3>晉磚是寗康年間古物</h3>
<p>他首先談到晋磚發現的詳細情形：</p>
<p>晋磚是在牛頭山　發現的，這地方離樟樹二十華里，是縣屬親湖鄉，當地的鄉人說：在淸朝咸豐同治年間，因為山洪和雨水的沖蝕，　壙就漸漸地坍露了，太平天國的軍隊過境時，鄉民都扶老携幼的認為是一個古窯，做他們避亂的安樂窩，在今年七月間，我和邑人徐元　先生特地到那裏去參觀，這是一個　野荒山的所在，　壙雖然坍露，可是荊棘叢生，　草塞徑，洞口黑黝黝的，陰森得使人可怕，我們覺得既然特地來參觀，如果一無所獲，難免失望，所以鼓着勇氣，撥開野草，　匐着由壙　進去，果然是一　　的　形的壙磚，壙是用三層石磚砌成的，十分堅實，高度因為泥土的積塞，無法能看淸楚，壙　面的面積，太概有五六尺的光景，再進就不可能，我倆在壙口摸索和端詳了好久，才又　匐着爬了出來！」</p>
<p>饒先生說話很快，也很興　，接着他在一個　漆色的樟木　櫃裏，捧出了一個白布包，他取出兩塊釉靑色的大磚，磚上還黏着黃土，一面微笑着解釋：</p>
<p>『這就是我們回來的時候，撿到的兩口墓磚，這磚長長三六，三公分，厚三，四三公分，　一八，五公分，重七，五公斤，這面沒有花紋的部分，卻厚有六公分，在磚的平面上，有『寗康二年　九月五日桂氏墓』十一字，在磚的另一端，還有桂氏　三字和雲形圖案。』</p>
<p>接着他說出了他考據的意見：『寗康是　朝　武帝的年號，離現在大約一千五百年，所以我斷定是晋墓是無疑的，不過桂氏究竟是什麼人？我查了縣志，　有記載，但是看這結　的宏大（長二丈餘）和堅實，可以決定不是普通的墓塚，磚上檏茂的字跡，也和晋碑相仿，并且在附近的許多露出土面的墓擴的完事　　看來，他的雲形。雙　，　布紋的圖案，也　不是近代的產物了，另外我還發現幾塊有着「初平」字樣的古磚，依我的考據，將是三國時候的漢墓，不過種種環境的牽制，如果能夠開　的話，也許會有更新的和更珍貴的發現。</p>
<p>他言下似乎不勝惋惜，記者抽完一支　烟，再問到他在大姑山發現漢墓的經過，他更加興奮的說：</p>
<p>紋酷似漢洗　漢墓的磚花</p>
<p>在民國二十年的時候，因為敵機濫炸市區，省立樟中搬往薌溪，這裏是距樟樹十五華里的一個大墟場，是淸湯—　　—頂有名的地方，課餘散步附近荒郊，搜拾着許多花紋墓磚，頗和晋磚相似，可是在當時不大注意，今年十一月，我因事返鄉，—　先生故里—特地邀了文化中學的陳潤玉和楊起秦兩先生，　　斌　鄉附近的大姑山，這裏離樟樹　十二華里，荒塚很多，我們撿集了許多墓磚，他的花紋同樣的精美　茂，有雙錢，雲形，方格，斜紋，　　，魚形……十多種，我考據金石　魚形紋和他　面的漢洗頂相仿，這種　有兩種，一種是長方形，一種是椎形，長闊厚都比晋磚略小，但是磚質卻比晋磚還要細　，墓　的坍露土面，也和牛頭山的相同，而且　磚在四周散落着，依我的推測，他的出土時間，也有一兩有年光景了。』</p>
<p>他說到這裏，又從另外一　布包裏，　出幾專磚塊，有的作　錢紋，有的是魚形紋，不過都殘破不全，另外比較完事的一塊　現着：</p>
<p>『崔四郞妻　聶四娘墓』</p>
<p>字體古樸，『崔』『四』兩字，很容易誤成『舊』字，他說：『這些磚，雖然沒有年號，可是從他的字體和花紋看來，可以確定是和牛頭山發現的晋磚是同一時代的，崔妻墓磚的字體，更有漢晋書意，　魚形花紋的，當是更寶貴的了，舊時　的稱郞稱郞，我查漢魏人名考—國立中正大學文史系教授張澤輯——在後漢時稱呼頂多，由此亦可以推斷此墓當在三國前後，附近的鄉民拕土葬墳時，也常常在穴中拕出墓磚和陶器很多，許多牧童　子，也時在山中拾得古老的殉葬物，并且有一個神話流傳着。</p>
<p>山上兩金鷄　傳說紛紛傳</p>
<p>神話說：「從前山上有兩隻金鷄，常常出來找尋食物，鄉人追捕，反被　傷手而忽然不見」的傳說，這些當然不可靠，可是在大姑山中的　古墓，有許多理藏土中未經發現，卻是千真萬確的事實！』</p>
<p>最後他補充的說：</p>
<p>『清江是古稱，荒服之地，在南唐時才開始設縣，樟樹依傍贛江東岸，是晋朝陶　母親的故鄉—樟樹有陶母的化梭亭—原　新　縣，以後改稱淸江鎮，牛頭和大姑兩山，恰好和樟樹鎮成為犄角形，在沒有設縣以前，當是近廓的高山，登高遠眺，可以看到平　沃野，人煙稠密，風景秀麗，氣熱雄偉，所以先後兩次發現的墓磚，花紋和字跡，都是秀　渾樸，在這裏也可以看出中古時代，這裏對花紋和藝術的考究和欣賞的大概，寗康磚和崔妻磚的字意相若，出土時同，當可以斷定是漢晋古物，是無疑義的了，如果有人能夠發掘和整理，以為日後考據的史料，這是我十二分期望的事。</p>
<p>當我離開這間房子的時候，　先生還客氣的送了我幾張古磚的拓片，并且還殷切的說：</p>
<p>『如果你有興趣的話，寒假我可以引導你去　　　』這種熱心考據和研究的精神和熱誠，是令人感動的，夕陽銜着遠　，人影散亂的時候，我輕鬆的結束了我的考古式約有趣的訪問。</p>

<h3>東北高等教育</h3>
<p>— 廿五日瀋陽航訊　本報東北特派員韓淸濤</p>
<p>東北光復一年多，開始辦理教育接收，已經有了八個月，小學師資和經費，既然有問題，中等教育又有需要積極改革處，高等教育更引起了多數人的不滿，除了省市教育當局時遭　難外，更大大怪罪教育部特派員　　芳先生。</p>
<p>青年熱愛國家</p>
<p>中小教育是由省市教育廳局辦理，更等教育和幾個專科學校，歸教育部東北區教育復員輔　委員會負責，輔委會在四月間開始工作，分別接收各院校，并收容安頓失學青年。</p>
<p>「東北靑年熱愛國家，是來關外後第一個印象，」「我接觸了許多二十歲以下的學生，教員們，都是這樣的，這可以說明敵偽教育的失敗，過去我們教育的成功，」教育視察團程其保先生這樣的對記者說，吉林主席梁華盛，也對記者鄭重的說過：「東北靑年是最可愛，最有為的，雖然受過敵偽八年奴化教育，但一點沒有被奴化！」我們應該如何的寶貴這個珍貴的成果，如果的發揚光大它？</p>
<p>可是半年來，東北靑年，有着許多不安於學業的事，這固然有政治等許多因素在內，但輔導的機關，正應負着許多的責任，今後在教育設施和領導上，更應多盡此力量，不能用手段，要真誠，要坦白，要大公無私，當然，國家貧困也正是多方不能盡令人滿意的原因。</p>
<p>現在，介紹一些教育部東北區教育復員輔導委員會，在記者席上發表的東北專門以上學校輔導復員的狀況，以稍帮助大家明瞭東北今日高等教育情形。</p>
<p>復員準備工作</p>
<p>東北區偽滿專科以　學校肄業生，為數頗多，當蘇軍未撤退以前，長瀋等地學生，紛紛自動入關，總計從卅五年二月廿六日起，至三月十二昌止，抵平學生共五百二十人，輔委會，會卒間在平　「東北靑年學生臨時訓導處」予以管理訓　，并呈凖教育部設立「東北臨時大學補習班」一歲，以　收容，聘陳克手為主任，卅五年四月底，瀋陽蘇軍撤退，將赴平的學生，遷回瀋陽，「臨大補習班」是在這時臨時開辦的，遵照偽滿專科以上學校肄業生就學　審辦法，陸續收容學生，全校共達三千名之多，　數月補習後，所有補習成績，尙稱良好，於卅五年九月底結業，各生經分發各相當院校就讀。</p>
<p>卅五年四月間，成了廣大數字的偽滿「國高」（國民高等的　稱，相當於初中二年級。）畢業學生，無法攻讀，由輔委會　設國立東北大學先修班一處，聘方永　為主任，後改為趨石　充任，從六月一日起至十日止，總計入校學生共達三千餘名，復以其他偽　國高畢業生，陸續　　　市，都打算即時就學，東大先修班，限於人力物力，不能再多收容，復經教育部凖在錦州。永吉，各設先修班一處，以使東北「國高」畢業生，都得有安身就學之所，　申明　和　景芳充當主任，錦州先修班於十月廿二日，永吉先修班於十一月廿二日，永吉先修班於十一月十一日，先後正式開學。</p>
<p>國立東北大學校舍，在本年四月間，由東大接管後，因為各處破壞甚重，設法着手修繕，半年以來，工程大部業已竣工，該校原在四川三臺教職員和學生，現已全部到瀋，都已安頓，除原有文，理，法，商，三學院外，并恢復工，農，兩學院，共廿二系，一專修科，十二月廿五日正式開學，惟因破壞過重，一切設備都需添置，復員幾等於重建，已請教育部抹植恢復舊觀，好得成為東北有力的最高學府。</p>
<p>教育部為了提高東北師資水凖，特於瀋陽設立師資訓練所一處，聘周慕文為主任，專收容現在或志願充任小學教師，每期三個月或六個月結業，於五月初旬辦理以來，第一期學員業已結業，全體分發各學校服務，至第二期學員，現已入所授課，卅六年初可結業，該所在第二期添辦體育童訓班一班，并請專家授課。</p>

<h3>越南局勢嚴重性　亞洲仍未能趨於平靜</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>這一星期，是一九四六年的最後一星期，國際上平靜無事，但是在亞洲一隅，却仍在動亂之中，越南局勢一天嚴重一天，法越衝突的範圍，也一天擴大一天，已非尋常事件可比了，因此引起了世界各國的密切注視。所以在這一星期內，世人的視綫集中在越南。</p>
<p>中英美的密切注意</p>
<p>越南局勢的日趨嚴重，其結果不僅將危及遠東一隅的和平，而且也足以影響及整個世界局勢的發展。與中英美三國，萬有深切的關係。英國外相貝文深恐越南局勢，影響及英國在東南亞洲的利益，已邀請英國內開會，討論當前的越南局勢。美國代理國務卿艾契遜，也向報界發表談話，表示美國對於越南問題的懷切。此在中國，因爲有僑胞四十三萬五千八百人在越南，法越發生任何衝突，都足以損害及華僑的生命財產，故中國政府不得不替這計多的僑胞焦急，而採取具　有效的護僑政策。</p>
<p>法越雙方　各趨極端</p>
<p>法國對於越南所採取的政策，依舊未改過去的作風，勃魯姆內閣雖爲進步的社會黨內閣，但是在這一星期內所採取的措置，仍是一種壓迪政策·（一）法國軍事當局奉政府之命，急調生力軍開往越南增援；（二）法國飛機參加戰爭，在越南上空，轟炸越軍集中地點。（三）法國殖民部長莫戴在西貢演說，堅決拒絕越南人民的獨立要求。（四）法國政府將衝突發生的責任，諉諸與越南力面。</p>
<p>此在越南方面，因爲全國人民受了民族主義的激盪，對於民族解放運動，決不能半途而廢，非爭取到獨立不止。胡志明總統曾要求法軍退出越南全境，國民黨領袖阮羣三，也主張組織「國民陣綫政府」，欲與法國週旋到底，並籲請中美兩國出面調處，所以越南問題，一時不易獲得解決。</p>
<p>勃魯姆氏　試探和平</p>
<p>越南可憂的局勢，如果任其自然發展下去。勢將造成非常嚴重的後果。法國一味要維持其在越南威信，也會使其得不償失的。甚至足以引起國內的政潮所以勃魯姆總理也不得不發電胡志明總統，說明殖民部長莫戴此行的任務，乃在以法越協定爲基礎，恢復越越南局勢。這是一種和平探試。聞胡志明將去電表示同意，並要求法軍當局頒佈停戰令。</p>
<p>只要法國能覺悟，明瞭帝國主義的時代已經過去，不再以殖民地看待越南，相信越南問題的和平解決，並不是不可能的。</p>
<h3>英公主希王子　訂婚之謎</h3>
<p>英國王位繼承人伊翼沙伯公主並沒有訂婚，其唯一原因是爲了她的父親顧念他愛女的宰福。</p>
<p>白金漢王富中飯後茶餘的談吐，衆口一詞承認伊麗沙伯公主極度鍾情於希臘王子烈浦。消息靈通的人們相信：要是沒有英王佐治六世的反對，比刻早已宜佈訂婚了。</p>
<p>但是倫敦各地能够獲悉確實消息的人們却堅稱：英王始終沒有爲了政治糾紛的理由而對於他女兒婚事提出過任何反對。據接近白金漢宮的人們說，伊麗沙伯公主把愛上希臘王子的事吿訴了她父親，而英王正如世界上一般父親一樣，勸吿她女兒不要馬上訂婚，他說：「等六個月後再說，把你的心確定一下。」</p>
<p>據情報可靠的人們說。英王的見解認爲英國王太子妃伊麗沙伯公主雖有和常人一樣享有正當巒愛的權利，却不能像普通女子一樣有隨便變心的自由。</p>
<h3>白宮　繽紛錄　門禁不十分森嚴　偷紀念的很多</h3>
<p>在白宮裏的床上睡覺舒適嗎？客人們有沒有偸東西做紀念品呢？又至今所有客人中倒底誰最難伺候？曾當白宮女總管前後共達十三年之久的耐絲畢特女士爲今年寫過一篇描述美國總統府的文章以後，引起讀者們紛紛去函提出類如上述的詢問要求解答。編者乃彙集全部問題和答案選擇其中獲得詢問函件最多者在本月份該雜誌發表。正像聽許多允許發問的演講會一樣，譯者認爲問題在本質上較叙述更爲警闢專詳，別有風味。謹就該文選譯數則如次，</p>
<p>白宮門禁究竟如何森嚴？</p>
<p>那裏的門禁當然要比你家裏的或者我家裏的來得森嚴一點。譬仿講前來和總統打撲克，和杜魯門太太談天，或者和瑪格麗特小姐談情說愛的客人們並不走過通道去按前門上的電鈴，他們得在白宮門口停步受秘密警察的查問，然後方得踏進迥廊，由一個規矩萬分的侍者接待，引導到樓上去。不過只要一旦走過作爲辦公室和國賓接待室的一二兩層樓，氛圍就是典型的美國人家，一點也不森嚴。</p>
<p>白宮裏的床舖是否舒適？</p>
<p>當我第一次試睡的時候，覺得它們很不錯，但是羅斯福家的孩子經過長時期的研究之後說它們不好——彈簧嫌太僵強，塾褥也嫌太硬。於是我便把褥十從新整頓過一次。此後從未聽見羅斯福或是杜魯門家的人，民主黨員或是共和黨員，帝皇或是將相們怨訴過。</p>
<p>白宮的客人愛偸東西做紀念品嗎？</p>
<p>我要說他們的確愛偸。在我住在本雪凡尼亞大街一千六百號的十三年中間失踪的調　數目簡直無法加以估計，在浴室裏不見的許多蔴質客用手中均須我加以添補。在這樣做的時候，我故意把總統府的略寫記號遺漏，於是這一部分的紀念物獵取在終被防止。但是在某一紀念日白宮開放任人參觀的時候，我們驚悉「東室」的大駡斯革花般　幕竟爲遊客截取小塊而去。這一點確實是一個始終使我們　搖的問題。</p>
<p>白宮裏最難僞候的客人是　！</p>
<p>人是蘇聯的外交人民委員長莫洛托夫·困難的地方則在於保　工作的煩密。舉例來說，當他在房間裏的時候，全體僕役均不得在同一層樓逗留。一直要等到他下樓以後，僕役們方被允准回返原地工作。因此莫洛托夫自然就使我們的工作非常困難了·不過照我的愚見看來，這些麻煩全是不必需的。因爲在一九四二年，聯邦偵查局戰時防護人員的嚴密戒備之下，即使是一個老鼠，想跑進白宮去威脅他的安全也不够。</p>
<p>白宮的對子，女待，堂　等　給　何？</p>
<p>嘮水數目甚爲驚人，自女停之每年一千一百美元至唐子之一千六百美元不等。他們間的人事更動則極爲頻繁，因爲在白宮工作兩年以後便可調至政府擔任較　閒的工作並獲得較高的薪給·</p>
<p>起用全部黑人血統職員的例子是誰開的！</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人。她覺得他們工作得很好，並且願意他們在她的旁邊·胡佛夫人黑白　混雜僵用·杜魯門夫人將羅斯福夫人的老人全部保留，僅僅增添了一個米蘇里廚子（　鳴釋自紐約時報）</p>
<h3>避免三次大戰　須讓養出男人來的女人　參加一切重要國際仁義</h3>
<p>聯合國機構能够帶給人類以永久和平嗎？近來有一個朋友把這個今”世界已最嚴重的問題拿來問我，但是對於他我却不能給以樂觀的回答。</p>
<p>每一個思路稍消的人都會有這種同樣的想法；我對於聯合國機構的目標全部同意，但是所害怕的是照他目前的組織方法，成功的機會是否會比在它以前的許多和平組織來得大，其結癥並不在於觀念或者目標上有什麼謬誤，而是它在根本上有着極嚴重的弱點。</p>
<p>以聯合國機構現在所左在的情形而論，它是一個爲男人所抱持，並且徹頭徹尾屬於男人的機構。經過那麼多血跡斑斑的歷史，現在又是一次了，政治家和崇尙權力的政客們又在不要女人協助之下試着建立世界新秩序。這種政策實在是非常可悲地不智和短見。</p>
<p>假使聯合國還想朝成功的路上走（它是非朝成功的路上走不可的），假使我們還想　要避免第三次世界大戰，我們就必定要識養出男人來的女人們參加一切會議。</p>
<h3>聯合國如家庭　需要兩性互助</h3>
<p>每一個人都知道，假使沒有兩性的互助合作，我們社會的最小單位家庭便不能美滿。我相信道同樣也是眞理；除了一個反應女人的思想，感情，與精神抱負和男人一樣多的國際機構，我們還能想望另外有什麼由民族組成的家庭獲得成功。</p>
<p>有史以來凡有確實證據的史實均足證明我的意見正確，女人在本質上是和男人迴異的·男人生活在現實的世界裏，因之最注重的目標往往在於工作的直接效果。女人却有着一種　及將來的强大的本能。因爲靠着女人的生理作甩，種族的生命方得一代一代地還下去，她們常渴望着不但是自己的孩子們，並且是孩子的孩子們都能有一個安全美麗的生活環境。在精神上男人從未能如女人顛及將來。而惟有顧及將來，聯合國纔能把人類的文明繼持下去。</p>
<p>假使讓女人參加的話，屬於本能的同情心還不過是她們千千萬萬極端珍貴的貢戲之一而已·雖然在這一代中已經發生了兩次鮮血淋淋令人沮喪的戰爭，許多男人對於戰爭似乎仍舊樓戀，這是他們從數不淸代數的戰士祖先那裏得來的遺傳。女人就沒有這種愚蠢的感情，她們得自祖先的遺傳是治療創傷而不是造成創傷。假使說在天下大事上也需要有治療性的工作，則其需要程度實無有過於今日者。</p>
<p>最要緊的是惟有女人纔能把人民對於聯合國的信仰弄得如同對於宗敎信仰一樣·男人單單伕賴理則和推理生存；女人則生活在她們的感情上面。屬於各民族的人一定要在心裏有着强烈的發自感情的信心，這許多民族方趨能够交織成一家·要想獲得成功，聯合國機構對於我們就必定要變得像敎堂，家鄕，旗幟那樣的神聖。惟有女人纔有力量使得它這樣神聖起來。（譯紐約時報）</p>

<h3>白種人在遠東已失優越地位　紐約時服記者視察後的結論</h3>
<p>— 陸承譯自紐約時報記者侖布爾著</p>
<p>亞洲各國民族主義抬頭　白種人回到殖民地上來　立刻感到極端嚴重困難</p>
<p>黃金時代已經成爲過雲</p>
<p>白種人在遠東已經失掉「面字〕，這是作者在中國，菲列賓，和荷屬東印度旅行並與亞滿其他國家內的白種居民談話以後，所不得不下的結論。各種單獨發生的事件，以及處處可見的新姿態均不可否認地表現着白種人的權力以及威望已經大减。</p>
<p>這種轉變，在許多地言都可以表現出來。中國警察以及低級官員態度的傲慢最爲明顯，看上去，中國人報復在治外法權朱牧回以前所申受舊方人的怨氣。差不多，每天都會有一兩樁驕慢的事情使上海的白種人感覺到他現在是中國宗主權底下的低等僑民。</p>
<p>在菲列賓羣島，雖然當日本人剛被擊退的時候有過一段「蜜月」時期，現在也常有一種强烈的反美情緒，非常公開地表現在馬尼刺的報紙上。菲律賓街上的行人顯示著以前從未有過的自大。這倒底是一種永久的轉變呢？還是僅是對於某些軍事佔領政策或者美國大兵不良行爲不滿的反應呢？這個問題也許沒有人能够回答。不遇他們加於美國人身上的打擊，確是方興未艾。</p>
<p>在遠東任何地方，白種人從前一度作爲國力的代表所會獲得的優越地位，現在已經喪失，並且或將永遠地喪失了。</p>
<p>除了上述秈族分離的發展以外，另外還有一種政治上的轉變，一種對於西方人統治的反抗。作爲這輪反抗的表現，在有些地方就是叛亂，在日本投降以後盟電佔領以前的一段時間裏，亞洲各種的民族主義黨派一致抬頭。這些人民中間的政治意識在數年之內，由於戰時以及戰後獲得良好的民　團結機會，已經前進達一世紀之遠。白種人回到殖民地上來立刻感到自己遭遇嚴重困難。他們自已表現過的理想，像大西洋憲章真的崇高的感情，反擊到他們自己的臉上。現在世界任何地方的殖民政策均正受考騐之中。</p>
<p>但是白種人喪失臉面和民族主義復蘇這二重轉變在荷屬東印度實較世界任何其他地方更爲　著</p>
<p>主子變成伙伴</p>
<p>印度尼西亞人仍舊呌白種人爲「土盎」—主子－，不過現在這「土盎」已經僅僅是一個名目罷了。「土盎」在荷屬東印度的黃金時代已經過去，當今橫在他們前面的是「布恩」時期「布恩」意即伙伴，爲印度尼西亞人中間相互的稱謂。</p>
<p>戰爭以米的短時間內，在印度尼亞西靑年的心中已經崛起了對於自己和對於民族廣大的　　。他們第一次感覺到自己也是一個人物·做了數世紀的殖民地的臣民以後，他們現在是屬於自己的國家裏的公民了。惟有以　一向　主子的白種人，現在纔　　屈居卑位。</p>
<p>荷蘭說肇端於大戰和日本人在這些島與上閃電式的勝利，這種情形是不可避免的。他們的束方征服者對白種人繼之所作公開的貶抑和侮辱會在印度尼西亞人民心上留下不可磨滅的影響·許多荷蘭人都相信盟軍挾着無比威力回來，將暴發的征服者加以掃蕩，鐵在菲律賓等地所作的那樣，的確給白種人挽回了不少肆望。重佔爪哇的計劃被日本投降縮短以後，荷蘭人都覺得對於這些島嶼的克復缺少了許多不可少的精彩表演。事實上光復這些島嶼時的確處置失宜，日太人在戰爭停息以後仍被留置鳥上統治着二月之久·就在這一段時間裏，印度尼西亞共和國抬起頭來，於是「土盎」的統治勢力便成爲過去。</p>
<p>荷蘭人依然可以把東印度羣島無論如何仍　是　土的一部份自已安慰自己。因爲在兩年以很所成立的荷印聯邦頭上依舊頂着荷蘭皇室·不過印度尼西亞人根舉在此地（巴達繼更）起草的協　，將有權管理自己的內政·現在荷蘭人知道他們已不再佔有這一個國家，而是在他們自己建黨的街道上的　民了。他們雖然依然能够保有私有財產，但是必需向印度尼西亞共和國納稅，從業主的地位他們已被突然降到佃戶。</p>

<h3>嚴霜烈日𣅜經過　次第春風到草盧</h3>
<p>— 子𢜳</p>
<h3>新年新希望</h3>
<p>（以收到先後爲序）</p>
<p>我個人對於三十六年的新年新希望，就是三十七年以后後，新年永遠比三十七年以前的快樂。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我對於國家的希望，是平日和平實現。對於自己的希望，是生活能够更有規律，儘量善用我的時間。有時想看電影「一曲難忘」和「亨利第五」，總失去機會。還有不少畫展和音樂演出，我常無暇每會必到，甚引以爲憾。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>我的希望，是從今年起，大家能在和平而快樂的環境中，好好地過日子。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>我沒有新希望，十年以來，每屆歲梢，我對人生；對世界；對社會；都懷着同樣的希望，所以我只能說我有舊希望，沒有「新希望」。</p>
<p>我希望人生像一株鮮妍的玫瑰；世界儀一座和平的花園；社會像一個光明的太陽！</p>
<p>我希望太陽消滅花園中的毒虫細菌，我希望朵朶玫瑰永恒地茂盛，永恒地美。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>淸閣說我「心理不健康」，的確·所以我沒有希望只有夢。</p>
<p>三四十年來，我夢見封建餘孽在吃人，夢見法西斯魔王在全世界放火，夢見貪官汚吏在大喝其鷄尾酒，夢見金條，小姐和法幣先生在賽跑，夢見木偶戲專家在中國劇塲在上演拿手好戲，夢見哀鴻遍野無人過問，夢見達官貴人政客在開空頭支票，夢見眞神，美神與和平之神都在哭泣……。正因夢見的太多，太可怕！使我多時不敢入睡，睜着雙眼等待着天明！</p>
<p>天明了！畫景與夢景並無二致！我等得够倦了，需要找一塊凈土長眠，永遠地長眠，運要都不想做了。</p>
<p>如果，定要我寫一點希望，那末，我祇有——</p>
<p>希望人類和地球都變成透明的水晶，好讓我仔細地看個究竟；或是發明一付Ｘ光的眼鏡，讓我帶着，能够看穿地球裏還埋藏着比原子更利害的是什麼？和人們神祕的心！</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>積極的新希望，在去年新年；今天已經不敢作如是想了。今年有的，只是消極的新希望：</p>
<p>調停產生奇蹟，國共居然和平，內戰憂然終止，砲火一掃而光。</p>
<p>權奸不少去職，貪汚削弱勢力，政客轉變作風，奔走呼號，　拳擦掌，的是爲了「人民的民主」。</p>
<p>工廠停止倒閉，商業定出厄運，物價無法上漲，生活比較安定；</p>
<p>於是國力復蘇有望，民力逐漸抬頭！</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>新年新希望似乎有詩爲證：</p>
<p>年年難過年年過，</p>
<p>歲歲傷春歲歲春，</p>
<p>若把新年來比萬，</p>
<p>東拚西補總勞心。</p>
<p>我欲乘風飛去也，</p>
<p>名　利鎖早來哉！</p>
<p>一時擺脫談何易？</p>
<p>只好一生認活該</p>
<p>舊的不去新難望」</p>
<p>責任當前要認淸，</p>
<p>斬伐夷除舊議，</p>
<p>迎新　作十分春。</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>我希望有一天要人們也過着和我們一樣淸苦的生活，或者我們也能過着要人們一樣舒適的生活。</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>歷史不會也不應重演的，我們讓社會上的一切醜的惡的，都成歷史上的陳跡罷！希望自今以後，世界上的每一個人都能過着人的生活——最低限度是吃得飽，穿得暖；每一個人能够有發展他的天才的機會與環境，能自由的說，自由的寫作；希望法律能成爲社會唯一的公平的尺度，把公道送到每一個人的門前；也希望自今以後，紅顏不薄命，東施得良樣；更希望天堂即人間，人間亦天上！</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>我希望一九四七是最美滿的一年。先希望各國人民快樂度日（物質的和精神的）。希望大家笑容滿面；希望太陽在我們心中照耀，像它照耀字宙那樣。我希望繼續研究中國，更認識中國，更愛中國。希望尊重「智慧」。愛好「眞」與「美」的朋友們同心協力，來崇拜，來歌頌人類向「理想」邁進。我更希望中國的兒女和法國的兒女密切合作，共同確定惟一的且標：促進人類文化，提高人類尊嚴。（法。克羅特·洛虛述　徐仲年譯）</p>
<p>十一</p>
<p>一提起「希望」兩字，祇能苦笑一下！小百姓不是沒有希望，但是直到現在，所有的希望都成泡影，還提它則甚？如果一定要在這個大年初一，說幾句好話，討個吉利，那麼，我也不妨順俗，再來痴人說夢。</p>
<p>咱們的國家呌做「中華民國」。不論在朝在野，所有的政黨，以及社會賢達，無不以「民主」爲號召，而且在「民主」之下，添上了：「只此一家，則無分出」字樣，大似一始創姑藝陸稿蘆」，猗歟盛哉！夫陸稿蘆者，熟肉店也：豈以民爲猪，而會其肉乎？非然也！欲賜民以食耳。所以，新年第一個希望：希望老百姓有太平飯吃，有太平日子過。</p>
<p>上下五千年，縱橫數萬屋：中國的文化的確是世界各國文化中的老大哥。在宗社裏，老大哥是當家子：有責任，也有享受·　而，百尺竿顯，更進一步，咱們目前的文化變爲「享受文化」，享受人家的文化的文化。何以見得？人家發明了這樣那樣，運到中國來推銷；咱們全盤接受，享福便了，何必傷腦筋，去研究？談學問，談研究的人都是天字第一號的傻瓜！這批人，近之則損，遠之則怨；賞；飯給他們吃吃，還要七百二十倍。一千倍的爭論！所以，新年第二個希望：希望智識份子都變爲「愛國」的商人，多販賣些外國貨。</p>
<p>若說我個人，希望素來不大。如果我能够「隨意」變爲　子，啞吧，鐵石心腸，那就恭喜之至！</p>
<p>人類是在希望中生活的；就是失望，在失望中也有希望。新年的新希望，在作者已不是新的了；早在三十餘年前，每當新年，總不免有元旦試筆一類的文章，來點綴新年的新景。這三十年來的記憶是慘痛的；然而我們依舊不能不有希望。這是希望使人類能够延續它的生命。</p>
<p>新年的新希望，什廢又是我所希望的呢？說我沒有希望吧，希望倒是有的。但是人過中年，希望似乎也不應該變爲奢望的了。我的希望很簡單，就是希望我能有平安。在抗戰的時期，無論處境怎樣逆轉，差幸我還享有平安；因爲有平安，所以沒有憂慮，所以就有所謂「心寬體胖」的稱謂。我們固然不應該輕視我們自己，但也不應該太重視我們自己。從事於文化工作的人有什麼法寳是衆所周知的事。「避　畏聞文字獄，著書都爲稻梁謀·」如果有新年的新希望，我的是這樣的：但願此後從事於文化工作的人，彼此都能有自知之明，彼此都能够得到平安。</p>
<h3>寄舲時代</h3>
<p>— 吳敬恒</p>
<p>寄舲者，八十二年前我在母胎出世，外祖母命我之名也。其原文當日「記　」。因求得觀着神蔽，爲「郭巨埋兒天賜銀」，外祖母以爲我即未埋兒之後身，欲希紳　有　，故日「記　「。今已不　，惟偕甞名本樓第三層，恰相當。四月廿五日，從重慮需留九年飛歸，五月三號又去南京，參輿五號還都禮，給東所謂避地抗戰；十七又從南京歸。其以早臥床上，覺萬物未整理，美哉吾物！然一旦爾脚一伸，撒手而去，諸物不知如何星散，轉覺大笑。人生本如寄耳！暫這此三樓，浮於高空，無吳一艙，舲有八室，可讀書，可寫字，可食飲，可排洩，可從容獨坐，可神倦優臥；老憊陽已萎，雖有佳麗，未能　橋；缺此一點以比秦始皇之阿房宮、自有遜色，然舲可支配，宮非所欲也。艙寄此所，我寄於艙，不知尙有幾何時？問此者非痴即愚，寄一天，算一天可也。中華民國三十五年五月十七記六月四日寫愚齋壁。（次年元旦發表）</p>
<h3>一個理想的實騐</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>四個半月刊編輯的回味</p>
<p>常常想，如果有機會自己來主編一個刊物，一定要嚴格的遵守着以下的幾條：</p>
<p>首先，要打破宗派的成見，成見是一個窄門，往往把好的東西關在門外。只要是本着「藝術良心」創作出來的，有眞實價値，有時代意義，有正義感和鬥爭精神的作品，一概歡迎。</p>
<p>其次，不問有名無名，只問作品好不好。名家作品也有組糙的，無名的作家也有傑出者。然而，也不能降格以求無名作家的作品，就像不能放手濫用有名作家的稿子一樣。</p>
<p>在自己的刊物上少刊自己的東西，把地盤公開給別人。就是刊用自己的文章，也一定要排在後邊，表示一點謙遜。而且，不一定把編者的名字大字排出來！當然，在某些必要的情况下非出名不可的時候，那又當別論了。</p>
<p>破費時間讀稿子因爲投稿者花許多心血寫成的東西，以「求售」的心投出去，像投出一個希望。如果編輯人看也不看的讓它積壓起來，那太對不住人也對不住自己了·新作家全是選拔出來的。當你發現一爐好東西的時候，興當得都要跳起來了，好似心和心打通了那麼的快樂。就是不合用的稿子，也應該在上面寫出自己的意見，呌作者折服，而不灰心。</p>
<p>式樣要樸素大方，校對要認眞不有，把一個標點也要安排在最美的一點上。稿費按時發，出版不脫期。……</p>
<p>這是我的一個理想，我會把它表現在一篇題名：「介紹一　詩刊」的短文裏，文章發表不久，竟有人投了稿子來，以爲我眞的在辦這樣一個刊物，其實是：「意國者，無是園也，意之如此云爾」。</p>
<p>去年（今天，可以說是去年了）八月我給「僑聲報」主編「星河」和「學詩」爾個週刊，前者是全販，後者是八　。這可有了機會給我實騐很久以來的那個理想了。道雖是一家無名小報，但我也用了全力去編它，約了各方面的朋友帮忙寫稿，每天總有幾份投稿從郵差手裏接過來。成　，重慶，香港，北平，天津，桂林，臺　…的許多前輩利朋友都源源約有稿子寫來，一直到現在，還積壓在我的抽　裏沒有機會刊出來。</p>
<p>可是理想和現實之間的距離總是那慶達！</p>
<p>第一，錯字有時多得看不清文句，甚至給「成」　　先生的頭上加一頂「草帽」；稿費，第一個月還好，以後就　峙間越拖越久了。十月份的稿費淸單，至今還沒有兌現·在我，這是一個很重的情神擔負！</p>
<p>因爲這些副刊沒能够給報館掙錢來，於是，五天之內，我接到了三　「　」令：第一道是縮小篇幅一律改爲六　，第二邁是：稿費一律减低爲三千至五千；第三這是副刊一律取消。</p>
<p>回想這四個半月的「實騐」，有歡喜，有歉疚，更多的是憤慨。</p>

<p>[K[&gt;P&gt;垃圾禮讃</p>
<p>— 王生珊</p>
<p>垃圾，大都市底風景綫，人間世的象徴。</p>
<p>這一堆堆，有來自農村的白菜底根　，靑豆底萁莢；也有來自海洋的龍蝦鬚　，鮮魚底鱗甲；有來自山鄉的珍餚底渣滓，也有來自水國的食物底剩餘。有來自熱　的瓜果底皮核，也許曾經素手的抓拿，　口的噙噣。也有傳自古代的珍玩底屍骸，也許曾經文人雅士所品賞：而今都只被拋棄在路旁，聽任行人踐踏。</p>
<p>這兒有破爛的絲襪，也有化裝品底包裝；這兒有緋色的情書，也有汚損的帳冊；這兒有破銅爛鐵，也有斷簡殘篇；有各樣的酒瓶，也有各樣的藥罐；有乳嬰底尿布，也有少女底經帶；有老人底痰沫，也有病人底嘔吐，有　婦底白髪，也有傷心人底涕淚。有落葉，有殘花，有糞便，也有英屍，有貴婦人失落的鑽戒，也有神槍手埋藏的武器。……</p>
<p>雨天增加了它的滋潤，一到放晴，便散佈着濃郁的芬芳。</p>
<p>紅的　　一片桃花，黃的耀眼如黃金，綠的如翡翠，亮的如水晶。白天行人從上面走過，車輛從上面蹍過，並不妨碍它底燦爛與光榮。夜來月光下一片發酵的靑　吐出光燄，宛如滿天晶瑩的星星；也像從高空瞰視這不夜之城。貪饞的耗子便出來慶祝新發現的寶藏，躦進又躦出，舞蹈而歌唱。</p>
<p>蒼蠅正和蠕蟻商量着組織合股公司；寄生蟲也打算着走走單幫；傷寒霍亂菌雖已接到正式任命狀，可是在對新聞記者的談話中，還在表示謙辭。一切都在暗地裏蠢蠢欲動，準備着一次大會串，表演各自底身手。</p>
<p>別看它只是一堆堆骯髒，它自蘊藏着無限的美麗與神秘。</p>
<p>毛毛蟲都從這兒變成了花蝴蝶，癩蛤蟆從這兒吃到了天鵝肉，就連胆小的吧兒狗，也可以放胆地到這兒冒一次險，希望獲得它想獲得的。</p>
<p>貓狗也許偶然會和耗子發生不幸的衝突，就算是鬥爭吧，那也正如人類底悲劇或喜劇，又有什麽關係呢。——天明，一切終歸於平靜；靜靜地等待接受新的堆積課程。</p>
<p>記着，大都市的市民們記着，你生活在這兒每天都會生產一又十分之二磅。二千四百噸，是四百萬市民每日的生產量，我們每個市民都是生產垃圾的義務勞工，為着生產垃圾而義務勞動。</p>
<p>這年頭兒誰都相信，「經濟第一，工作第二」，為了貫澈節約宗旨，所以我想主張保存這都市的風景綫。旣省錢又省事，旣省人工，又省掃帚。</p>
<p>堆吧，堆吧，堆成摩天大樓那麽高，堆成古金字塔那麽大，堆成山嶽，堆成邱陵，堆成大都會底文化堡壘。</p>
<p>然而，多事的淸道伕終於剷喲，掃喲，可是剷掉了一天的，又堆上一天；掃掉了一年的，又是一年；路邊的垃圾何嘗肅淸！正如社會底渣滓，正在隨着人類歷史的演變而浮沈。</p>
<p>堆吧，垃圾！堆吧，渣滓！大都市底風景綫，人間世的象徴。</p>
<p>跋記</p>
<p>離滬十載，去歲夏初東歸，放眼街頭，積穢未除，頗觀奇觀，因成是篇。嗣以幾經遷徙，早置篋底。瞬屆元旦佳節，文思鈍濃，苦不能撰應時文字，乃以是篇稍加竄削，附刊補白，權代歸客之券禮，當亦不無除舊之意，讀者諒不以為侮也。</p>
<h3>民元開國與總統就任</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>中華民國元年元旦的一天，是中華　國數千年歷史上團體和政體改革的新紀　，也是我國　法演變的一個轉折點，同時世界上占有四分之一的人民脫離君主專制被壓迫的政治轉入民主共和的階段。意義是非常重大。這一天，就是國父就任民選中國第一任大總統的日子，屈指算來，已經三十六年了。</p>
<p>這一個中國歷史上的大轉機，固然是革命黨人努力了十八年的組織和不斷地行動，續到事機成熟，武漢起義後一個多月，便有十多省先後光復，組織中央政府來綜攬行政的統一機構，對內對外，都有極重要的關係。</p>
<p>起初，由江蘇都督程德全，浙江　督湯壽潛聯電滬軍都督陳其美，提議由各省公推代表，在上海集議，仿照美國十三州會議的制度，為全國二十二行省的一致行動。經過兩三度的會議，由代表會舉黃興為大元帥，黎元洪為副元帥，擬定大元帥職權，主持中華民國臨時政府。可是在武昌的各省代表，卻表示異議，黃因此辭職。各省代表重選黎元洪為大元帥，黃興為副。可是黎不能到南京，黃也力辭，聲言要等候國父歸國。結果，黃黎都沒有就職。</p>
<p>國父在歐洲各國外交活動完備之後，在十一月六日安抵上海，革命空氣，和全國的視綫，領袖的人選，另進入新階段。</p>
<p>國父到上海的第二天，同盟會的幹部多人，在愛　園公宴，並協商組織政府事。黃興，陳其美，宋教仁密商推舉，國父為大總統，跟着向各省代表示意，根據事實，國父領導革命十八年（從興中會成立日起），勞苦功高，是最適當的人選了。馬君武更在民立報，發表論文，喚起黨內外人的注意。晚間在國父寓所，蹉商政府組織方案，宋教仁強調內閣制。國父根實當時事實，力持不可。黃興勸宋收回提議，宋還未肯。黃在第二天赴南京代表會提出三案：一，改用陽曆；二，起義時用黃帝紀元，今應改為中華民國紀元；三，政府組織取總統制。結果完滿決定。</p>
<p>各省代表於十一月初十在南京舉行臨時大總統選舉大會，到會者有冀，奉，魯，豫，鄂，湘，粵，桂，閩，晋，　，秦，贛，皖，川，蘇，浙等省代表四十五人，規定每省投一票，不記名。浙江代表湯爾和主席，開票結果，孫文得十六票，黃興得一票，合十七票。當將要投票選舉的時候，湖南代表譚人鳳暗向居正說：「你是湖北代表，總統宣舉黎元洪！」可是黎卻沒有一票，可見那時全塲代表的心理。</p>
<p>國父當選後，代表會特派王寵惠陳陶怡等攜帶證書到上海歡迎大總統晋京就職。國父吩咐陳其美說：「我們革命黨，一切應該革除陋習，不要採取什麽儀式。只準備客車一輛便夠了。」陳遵命，通知路局辦理。當十一月三日，上午八時，由上海北站　　。下午五時，車抵下關，升禮砲，湊軍樂。當日滬　和寗省兩鐵路接軌，繼續乘車入城。雖然　風刺骨，但是各界歡迎大總統的熱誠興致絕不減低。</p>
<p>國父抵站在車中時，四　有兵護衛，閑雜人等，不許上車。未幾，國父自車　下月台，手拿平常軍帽，身穿土黃色質軍　，沒有佩帶肩章金帶等。出站後，乘藍色　花彩綢馬車，軍樂馬隊奏凱旋歌前導，後隨衛隊，直向總統府（舊兩江總督署）駛去。</p>
<p>稍息，各省代表齊集，報告選舉經過，請即日就職。是夜十時，國父行接任禮。</p>
<p>公布這一天為中華民國元年一月一日。第二天，代表會議決添選副總統，為了一時　宜，黎元洪當選。跟着組織內閣，提出代表會同意。仿美國制，不設總理。從此對內對外，有新立的中央政府綜持一切了。</p>
<p>撫今追昔，當然有無限的感慨。然而三十多年來，新陳代謝，國事人事，變遷很多，今後復興建國的責任，是在於全國的英豪，　除私見，共同努力合作，建設完成一個三民主義的國家，緣不負當年先知先覺們創造民國的志大願宏了。</p>
<h3>元旦頌</h3>
<p>載揚的國旗，帶來了新的年頭——民國三十六年。</p>
<p>今天是三十六年的第一天，元旦，這所謂元，是說歲之元，日之元，時之元，元的啓示，新的表現，所以元旦是可歌頌的，不過古人拿君主代替了國家，這一天，「羣臣上千秋萬歲壽，制曰履新之慶。」下之則只知道祝賀自己的富貴，像元微之說，「富貴祝來何所遂，聰明鞕得轉無機。」的反語的人畢竟是少的。現在人的眼光當然以國家為前提了，可是在「中華民國萬歲」的頌聲下，大家見了面，總交換一句「恭喜」，範圍着一己的觀念，元微之的罪人！</p>
<p>案頭的日曆換了三十六本，雖然不及公元的長了一千九百四十七歲，但我國國曆到了這個數字也頗不容易。從前「曆」的命運跟着封建之圈而轉移的，在漢武帝以前，連元旦也沒有準定，照相傳的曆計算，黃帝及殷周兩代建子為正，十一月當作正月，秦正建亥，十二月當作正月，到武帝元封七年，才改正過來，一直幾千年就用着這個曆，呌「古曆」，是比黃帝還早時期的太初曆，建寅為正的。中間顧瓊夏禹也如此，所以又呌「夏曆」，當然，在現時代成了過去的名詞；可是夏曆有的人稱「農曆」，這卻很適合，它載明什麽時候「穀雨」了，什麽時候「芒種」了，以至立春到立冬，現在的國曆不也沿用着一旁標註這些節候嗎？從封建之圈打出來存其良，廢其　，於是奠定了國曆九長的命運，我們在今天來上千秋萬歲壽，頌民國的綿延，尤其是中興的第二個元旦，該可以接受這「履新之慶」吧！</p>
<p>然而，勝利到現在，一個年頭是　過了，要能夠「思往」，才可與言「瞻來」，我們檢討一下過去的一年，去年這個日子，我們是怎樣的？那是剛從「猾夏」的外禍下重振起大漢的天聲與威儀，一片的呼聲，復員，復原，可是復員的現象不忍覩，復原自然趕不及原狀了。最切膚痛心的是小民生活仍然窒息着高壓下的掙扎，而國內的烽火，又燃遍了方摕净腥羶的每一塊土，一個年頭就匆匆過去了。但我們不會悲觀，因為極端艱厄襄爭取光明的教訓，八年中都滐滐體　過來的，過去的一年，在「剝極則復」的不久，殘餘的痛苦我們自得承受，而立憲也在這一年完成，今天是頒布了，年尾，正是憲法實行的時候。我們要看今年的一年，這一年的時間是不平常的。</p>
<p>三十六年，不平常的年頭，是的，這「三十六」的數字，告訴我們是好的象徴。從「六」說，是易卦的陰數，而六六為坤，坤象地，彖辭稱「至載坤元，萬物資生。」可以說，六，象地一樣的廣大而厚載，所以人倫有六親，性格有六情，教化有六德，而六六三十六，　的分天下三十六郡，漢的服西域三十六　，更是威德遠播的現象；我們希望，自朝至野，要緊抓住這不平常的一年，怎樣地「廉黃立　」，在今天的元旦，不能再做元微之的罪人了，共同担負起建國的重任。那麽，還政的時候，元元之民，始能從生活的高壓下回復安樂的春台，而我這元旦頌，不致成了「柱下冀辭」。</p>
<h3>話劇的倒退兩步與邁進三步</h3>
<p>— �</p>
<p>一年以來，話劇的危機在增長著，情形的確很嚴重，主要的表現在：劇本創作的稀少和職業演出所遭遇到的困難。</p>
<p>抗戰八年，是話劇的黃金時代，從通都大邑到窮鄉僻壤，到處都有話劇團體的足跡，無疑的話劇對宣傳抗戰和發揚民氣起著很大的作用。軍隊演劇的普遍，反映出話劇如何為抗戰服務，作為一個重要的政治教育工具而存在。根據軍事委員會政治部初步統計，全國職業的話劇從業員不下五萬人，而業餘從業員的數目常數倍于此，可見當時話劇運動蓬蓬勃勃的景象。</p>
<p>「孤島」時代的上海，聽說有十多個話劇院子，而且十塲九滿，大可以和內地媲美，把此一時期內，內地和陷區的劇本創作匯計起來，　不論在數量上質量上都是中國新文藝運動以來稀有的收穫。</p>
<p>一年以來，劇本創作，竟可以說絕無僅有，就已經上演過的來講，好像只有「捉鬼傳」一個，可是一年以前在重慶，已經聽到作者吳祖光先生談及這個劇本的創意，祇是最近寫畢而已，還有兩個新作品：「山河怨」（在「文藝復興」分期刊載）與「和平頌」（在文匯報逐日刊載），都是李健吾先生近作，但尚未見全豹。就數量上講，實在夠希少的了。</p>
<p>為什末創作劇本如此難產？首先是生活的不安定。時至今日，文化工作者實在是處在「救死不暇」的境遇中，「著書都為稻粱謀」正算是太平盛事，目前文藝寫作者連這點都近於幻想了。寫戲受技術上的種種限制，比別的創作所化的力氣要多，誰又願意捨易圖難，去博取不可靠的升斗之需呢？而且即使寫了，除非是成名的作家，否則書店里不願意承印你的東西；為了物價漲了，成本高昂，普通人沒有錢買書來看，有錢的人又不大看書。東西寫了，即使印了出來，上演的機會亦渺茫。其次為了忙于張羅仰事府蓄，或者困于洒掃執炊的家常瑣事，作家無法也沒有心情執筆。勉強執筆，而環境種種，使他不能暢所欲言。這些這些直接地簡接地消磨了劇作家創造的意志，形成劇本停產的現象。</p>
<p>上海話劇院子從抗戰時期十多個一下子退到今年初的五個，退到目前孤零零的兩個，而且營業都不很好，在艱苦地掙扎中。</p>
<p>話劇職業演出底最嚴重的問題，當是基本觀眾的減少。固然一部分原因是由於好萊塢影片的傾銷；可是更大的原因，恐怕還是為了票價連捐稅的負担太重。話劇的基本觀眾是公務員學生和職業靑年，這些人都是通貨膨脹中的　難者。他們雖然很喜愛話劇，可是化不起錢。只要看上海劇　上演的「草莽英雄」時的賣座情形，賣全價，生意極慘，賣半價，就客滿——結果，賣半價，劇團收入反而增加多多。為什末不能減低票價，去適合那支持話劇的觀眾的消費能力呢？</p>
<p>演出費用的高漲，也是一個大問題。目前職業話劇團體沒有一個自己的劇院，不能不付出極高的院租，有的是「分賬」，有的是「包底」，比如「上海劇藝社」就是「包底」的，假如今天生意不好，還要掏腰包出來賠貼前台。同時為了演出費用的增長，不能不乞靈于高利貸，這是一個泥淖，可使任何商業陷入絕境，無法自拔。</p>
<p>由於上面的困難，劇團當局不得不竭力節省演出的費用，節省的結果，裝置往往困陋就簡，道具和服裝，也不肯多多購究，排演也馬馬虎，話劇演出的水準於是乎低落。由於演出水準的低落，僅有的幾個觀眾逐漸增加失望，營業更無起色，於是劇團當局再在減低演出費用上打主意，營業就更差，兩個因素交相為用，話劇營業推向下坡露。</p>
<p>在上海如此，在別的城市裏，據說也是如此。</p>
<p>觀眾要求反映現實，話劇不能滿足他們的要求，為什末？在若干地區，劇本審查和演出審查的幾重檢查制度，依然存在；因此一個有現實意義的虛，經過幾度「修正」，反映現實的成分減低，也就無法適應觀眾要求，因此影響上座。</p>
<p>最后一點，無可　言的，今天的話劇演出，已經脫離了過去優良的傳統。不差，從愛美到職業，　是把戲劇工作經常化與事業化，本來不是一件壞事。可是市僧主義鑽進話劇界。過去話劇行政公開經濟公開的精神喪失了，負行政與經濟責任者，往往和演員及其他工作者分了家，後者變成一個單純的雇員。在某一程度上，大家不復一致的追求藝術上的共同目標，或者從事於一種理想的現實；我們知道不管什麽團體，如果經濟，行政與人事的措施不能合理，必然影響事業的發展與存在的。</p>
<p>過去的一年，可說是話劇後退兩步的一年。話劇可能遭遇到更大的困難，我們堅貞的話劇運動的戰士，當能努力克服這些困難和弱點，在一九四七年中，向前邁進三步。——卅五，十二，廿四——</p>

<h3>歲首</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>一元複始，萬象更新，瞻望來日，每個人各有他的希望與光明，而逥想過去，又不免百感交集。</p>
<p>過去這一年，雖然是抗戰後勝利的第一年，但無論從國家或從個人來說，這是一種受難的延續，與我們在抗戰期中所懸想的勝利後情景，大想逕庭。其實這也難怪，我們本是個積弱積貧的國家，一且遭此互慰，且持續八年苦戰，無所的新傷，傎可謂創深痛互，咄嗟之間，又怎能全部恢復舊觀，且更邁步前進？我們不能滿意，是必然的，然而我們每個人都有責任，這責任就是我們努力的不夠，甚至並未努力，甚而至妨礙他人的努力！</p>
<p>然而就在這受難的延續的一年中，我們却召開了國民大會，完成了國家的一部根本大法，這一成就是輝煌的，也許祗能用這筆成就來交待過去這一年的賬項罷。</p>
<p>今年如何呢？希望不可不有，但不必太奢，凡百方面，當然會有進步的；但我們每個人要訴諸自己的良心，我的工作，我的事業，我的生活行為，除去利己外，是否是利人？是否夫使他人受損害？</p>
<p>新年歲首，願以此共　！</p>
<h3>遍地干工于戈車　迎春酒不香</h3>
<p>— 子愷</p>
<p>寓言</p>
<h3>新舊交替　雞狗豬</h3>
<p>— 隨</p>
<p>三十五年除夕之夜，在一片鑼鼓與爆竹聲中，狗星披了一件「丙戌」式的破破爛爛的外衣，精神萎敝不堪，一條尾巴在庇股裏夾得緊緊地。</p>
<p>它正要去找豬星辦理交接手續，剛出大門，四週就傳來一陳「噓」聲，定睛一年，原來是些剛從店裏廠裏打烊出來的職工們：「又要吵年賞問題了！」狗星心裏一肚皮怨氣，想想自己即將移交，何必代人受過，　頭望外衣領裏一縮，三步併作兩步，急急離開了門口，邊走邊想，去年此時雞星和自己辦理交接時，曾說過：「未必盡如人意，但求無愧我心」，雖然今年人們對自己毀多譽少，但自己鞠躬盡瘁，東西奔走，捫心無愧，既然無愧，那就「噓且由他噓去，好官我已為之！」</p>
<p>狗星一高興，尾巴伸得筆直。正在這時，迎面來了一羣鬼鬼崇崇的傢伙，咎自己彎腰陪笑，垂手肅立道傍，狗星認得是些已經躲藏將近一年多了的漢奸們，現在檢舉截止，他們又要大搖大擺地出來鑽營賣弄了，不免鼻頭哼了一聲：「便宜了你們這一般賊貨！」</p>
<p>狗星有着一般傲官的人的習氣，經不起人家一陣獻媚，自傲之心不覺油然而生，於是復又高視關步，剛繞受了的一些奚落的冤氣使無形中忘却得乾乾淨淨了</p>
<p>穿過兩條馬路，有許多店家板門上都貼着「宣告清理」的告貼，狗星心裏打了兩個寒噤；走過配售處門口，在白天擁塞得像一條長龍似的路邊上，幾個　三們踡縮着，蕭條而又悽清，狗星搖搖頭，歎了一口氣。</p>
<p>到了豬星家裏，老豬正在牀上吞雲吐霧，狗星大吃一驚，拿出身邊兩本移接清冊來，鄭重而又嚴　地指着一行「元旦起×××處以極刑」的工作綱要說：</p>
<p>「人家說你糊塗昏憤，老兄怎麼還不善自檢點？」</p>
<p>「怎麼？」豬星懶洋洋地。</p>
<p>「××是你老兄接任後的第一件大事？你倒躬親示範，以身試法！」</p>
<p>「你太少見多怪了！我正因為明年起要領導大家××，所以趁今年最後一天××痛快，老兄，你別瞧我糊塗，明天起我也要力改前非，重作新人了！」</p>
<p>「新人……」狗星挺了一挺尾巴。面對着精神煥發的老豬交卸幾本厚厚的清冊。</p>
<p>房間裏雖然烟霧　氣，但是看看老豬身上那件「丁亥」式的新袍，光彩耀目，好像有無限新鮮氣象，狗星愉快而又輕鬆的微笑起來。</p>

<h3>恭喜發財</h3>
<p>— 洪果</p>
<p>往年元旦，大家說「恭喜不發財」，今年元旦，我們却不能不希望發財了！因為過去一年，大家窮夠了，窮得「大大小小，面無人色！」</p>
<p>值茲一元　始，萬事重新做起，咱當老百姓的，強作笑顏，勉度新年，只希望干戈一化而為王帛，槍砲軍火一變而為生產機器，交通趕快恢復，工廠趕快複工，千君萬語，歸根一句話：「和氣生財！」</p>
<p>元旦　發筆，萬事大吉，恭祝和平，恭喜發財！</p>
<h3>元旦風俗　希奇古怪</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>加拿大的杜科勃民舞</p>
<p>每逢元旦，必在家裏端端正正地放一只空椅子，當它上面坐着一位貴賓似的，殷勤侍候，並且還要端菜給他　。</p>
<p>杜科勃族人深信：不速之客是來自天國的，如果元旦日傎　約有陌生客人翩然蒞臨，那他們認為無上的榮幸，那客人會帶來了一年的幸福。即使沒有陌生客人來，他們照樣要「像煞有介事」地送客，不過門不可開，恐怕「幸運之神一會悄悄地溜走了！</p>
<p>蔽人逢年節，「活佛」照例大請其客，並有「萬舞」「飛神」等西藏特有技藝之表演。各地人民，不遠千里而來，叩見活佛，以金珠寶飾舉在頭頂而跪獻，活佛如接受，則用盧尾三拂其首，這位信徒就大喜若狂，凡婦女見活佛必用紅糖塗　，否則即係「呈妍迷惑憎人」，大惡不赦。</p>
<p>回民過元旦最乏味，原來他們在每年大除夕早晨起，凡十歲以上的男女一律「餓肚皮」，不准飲食，甚至連唾液都不能下咽，這樣他餓了一年——直到明年的元旦日。</p>
<p>美國境內的「猶契」印第安人，尤為滑稽。他們每逢元旦要飲用球蛇花根草煎的苦汁，那苦汁人飲了必定生病，然而他們却非飲不可。飲了生病，病好了再飲，飲了又生病，到病好了又飲……這樣連飲了七次，生了七塲病，才算「功德圓滿」。</p>
<p>元旦日，在「猶契」印第安人村落的廣塲上，土人長長的排着行列，等着飲苦汁。生了病便到坑邊去，坑邊也躺着長長的行列。</p>
<p>據說，他們以為飲了苦汁而生病，會使身體潔淨，那麼，「太陽」會喜歡他們，一年中　物定然鑒收。</p>
<h3>從大霧飛機失事　談孔明大霧借箭</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>天有不測風雲，致有三航機失事，而人「定可以勝天」的一語，在今日未可全信了！</p>
<p>講到這一次的「不測」，是天空有着「漫天的大霧」！</p>
<p>講到「霧」，我們想起了一位三國時代的諸葛孔明，在一夜大霧之中，借曹操十萬大箭。</p>
<p>諸葛孔明的借箭，也是熟曉「天文」的關係，他在周瑜的帳中，知道三天後必有「大霧」，所以斗胆的寫下了「軍狀」，諸葛孔明的「熟曉天文」，能以生命來幹着一幕「滑稽劇」，的是「司人」！，考證借箭的時候，正是節交冬至之後沒有幾天。</p>
<p>現在飛機失事，出是在冬至後的三天，冬至一陽生，在天氣上的轉變，必有「大霧」，孔明借箭是一個例子，而火燒赤壁，孔明「借東風」，正是天氣當然的獲化，古人早已透測這一些「玄機」，而現在號稱科學日進的今天，反有這一着之差，並不注意到「冬至一陽生」，天時的變幻，傎有些感到「今人不及古人」了！</p>
<p>從這裏，可知道中國古代，未必沒有天文科學的學院，祗因為大家引為「秘笈」，不肯傳諸後人，自私自利，不肯公開研究，遂致有了好的學說，後起無人，這傎是一件可憾的事！</p>

<h3>為何涉嫌？</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>霍達耐敎授說：『郭雷是一個固執和沉默的老頭子，但是我很喜歡他。去年十二月他被謀殺了後，我就決心偵探這案件。勃郎生，是他一生中最後訪問他的客人，當然，勃郎生對於這次造訪是應該有所解釋的。</p>
<p>『勃郎生說：「我把自己的去處（假使有事的話，到那裏來找我的地址和電話），告訴了我信的旅館中人之後，我約在五點　的時分，到達了郭雷的郊外的住宅中。我瞧見他在微暗的薄暮中，坐在書房中的長桌旁。他揮手要我坐在零外的椅子中，並且約我陪他在晚上八時一同進晚餐。坐下後，我伸手摸香烟，我記起來了郭雷是嫌惡香烟的，我就把香烟放下了。</p>
<p>『「對於我們的討論，他主要供獻，是點點頭表示贊成，或是咆哮一聲，或則用「是」或「否」一個字表示一切，郭雷先生是不肯浪費詞句的。</p>
<p>『「大約在七點鐘的時候，電話令響了，他要我去聽。那是我的妻，要我立刻回去見一個客人，話講完了之後，我回到了我的椅子中，我把電話中的事告訴給他聽，郭雷點點頭答允了我立刻要回去的講求。</p>
<p>『「在出來的時候，因為燈沒有開，我把頭撞痛了，這可以解釋為什麼我頭上有傷痕的緣故，正當我走近門口的時候，他在後面呌住我說——「明天早晨十點鐘再見吧！」大約七點鐘過了一些，我離開他的時候，他還是好好的活着呀！」』</p>
<p>霍達耐敎授繼續說：『雖然勃郎生的電話證明是確實的，然而他的話還沒有說完之前，我就知道他是牽涉在謀殺案之內的！』</p>
<p>聰明的讀者，為什麼勃郎生是有嫌疑的呀！</p>
<p>答案四日分曉</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織23</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>捉毒蛇</p>
<p>在硬採丐幫中，以蛇丐的行業為最有出息。因為他們是江湖中專門技術家，非有傎才實藝便不能混得下去。因為毒蛇，談者色變，誰都不願意惹怒它們的。但蛇越毒則得利越厚祗要克服了蛇毒，則可左右逢源，無復衣貪憂了。所以蛇丐祗須出道，便可脫去百結的鶉衣，儼然列　於四民之中了。所以要做蛇丐，必須有更大的耐心，誠心地拜師習藝。老成的蛇丐對於收取丐徒，十分地慎重。凡是不可雕的朽木，一概都在落選之列，除了忠誠伶俐之外，還須有健全的體力，文教是合格的入選徒弟。</p>
<p>「捉溜子」即「捕蛇」的幫中切口，「溜子」便是「蛇」的總稱。但幫派繁多，也有稱為「挖地龍」者。捕蛇必須預告學會了製蛇藥，切口稱為「合線」，其中社會的秘方，祗有本幫人知道，輕易不傳給外行人的。據筆者偵查的結果，說是用「臭虫」和「耳屎」放在陰陽瓦上烘製，然後研為細末，其毒無比，可以克服毒蛇。但他們確曾將「蜈蚣」用竹　拔住兩頭，活生生地曝晒成乾。瑞在陰陽瓦上烘，然後研末成丸。這「蜈蚣丸」却是白色而帶有藥草味，其中大概是混　進其他藥品可知。秘方之秘，自然也無從究詰了。次要的藥方，是燒酒拌雄黃，和人口裏的呼和唾涎。據說是燒酒去毒氣，雄黃去毒味，唾涎去毒汁。此類江湖說法，自然祗好姑妄聽之。不過，捉蛇的當兒，確要用這三樣東西，先用亂絲棉　在臂膊手掌，像西醫包紮爛腿一般。把燒酒雄黃唾沫浸塗得淋漓盡致，伸手入穴便可一捉到手。碰到「龍莊」（蛇窠）裏有最毒的蛇和許多小蛇的便須吃「蜈蚣丸」。說是蜈蚣能夠克蛇，可以，「以毒攻毒」。</p>
<p>若是逢到在平地上游的蛇，捉起來來自較利便。蛇丐祗須搶上一步，在蛇頭上用力一擊，蛇便往上直竄，但　下去還游。再是一擊，蛇再　不大高了。第三擊，蛇有些受了不，不會再游動了。便　住了「七寸」地方。（即在蛇頭下七寸之處）將蛇尾向上，勾住了臂膊，緊緊盤繞着，那時切不可用力挺住，祗好鬆鬆地隨蛇盤繞，一會兒自然鬆下來。只一抖蛇便不動了。於是納入「龍宮」（蛇籃也）裏去，任憑蛇丐撥弄，也不發威了。捉住了毒蛇，　「蝮蛇」，「赤練蛇」等，都取出蛇膽賣給人吃。在過去千百年間，江湖上均認蛇膽是醫眼光不明的對症良藥。不毒的蛇像是「青梢」「黃梢」，都可剝皮吃肉，據說很有美味。祗是不能用鐵鍋或鋼鍋烹煮。舀水也不能用銅杓，須用瓦鍋，不然便有毒害人，大概是化學作用罷。</p>
<p>蛇丐學會了捉蛇之後，便可以單刀匹馬地去做生意了。有了蛇，便等於有了錢，賣蛇藥，賣活蛇，售蛇胆樣樣都是生路。將蛇皮煨灰和涼片醬爛腳據說有奇效。蛇皮裏爛膀，敷冰片，也有醫愈的可能性。蛇丐的眼藥非常名貴，其實就是蛇胆和黃連等藥合成的。蛇肉可作食品，有鹹的淡的，乾　的，說是有去　　癬之效，惟無從證實耳。</p>

<p>當作者此文發表之時，或即適爲中華民國憲法正式頒佈之日。憲法內容究將爲何，余執筆草此文時，尙難臆測。惟可斷言者，此次國民大會旣已非一黨一派之會議而爲全國性之會議，則不日即將頒佈之憲法，亦決非一黨一派之憲法而爲全國人民所共同制成之憲法。斯正合於「國民黨之宣言」所稱：「惟國民黨與民衆深切結合之後，中國民族之眞正自由與獨立始可有望」。又國民黨第一次代表大會宣言曾謂：「憲法之所以能有效力，全恃民衆之擁護」。亦惟與民衆深切結合所共同制成之憲法，方能得民衆之擁護。夫中國國民黨之與中國人民，本具有先犬之結合。五十餘年以米，中國國民黨倡導革命，推翻滿淸，完成統一，戰勝强敵，在三民主義國民革命之大義下，犧牲無數生命財產，前仆後繼，百折不回，是國民黨實際上自始即與全國人民之血汗澈底化合，凝成一片。今者國民黨又本其一貫之方針，堅決及早召開國民大會，制頒憲法，以期還政於民，此種大仁大勇，至大至剛之精神，允宜爲國人所共鑒共諒。顧於制憲會議之中，前述多數深明大體之代表，不免陷於口是心非之苦境。而少數黨派對於着干無關宏旨之文字問題，反均頗有盛氣凌人。惟我獨尊之概，對多數代表施以極大之壓力，而多數代表又終能捨己從人，接受內心所不願接受之憲法理論與條款。屈計旦夕之內，全部憲法草案，必可獲大會之通過，「頒行全國，永矢咸遵」。在此中外古今空前之大會中，來自多方多黨多階層之一千七百名左右代表，竟能充分表現此種相互忍讓之偉大精神，此固由於革命主義之涵需與主席人格之感召，而代表同人顧全大局，和衷共濟之美德，亦即我中國民族數千年來克己復禮，公爾忘私之傳統文化，實有足多者焉！</p>
<p>西　有云：「好的開始，即爲成功之一半」。此次國民大會爲歷史上一劃時代之會議，當學習民主之初，即奏此適合民主之效，作者個人又不勝於忐忑矛盾，苦悶感慨之餘，對於我國民主前途，頓生無限之希望也。</p>
<p>余之爲此言，旣非自慰，更非自欺，實可謂爲由此二者混合而成之自勉，竊願當此完成制憲，元旦獻詞之際表而出之，以與國人相共勉耳。</p>
<p>木必自腐而後虫生。國民黨之有大功於中國，天下之所公認也。乃於抗戰勝利之時，即有政治協商之舉。綜觀協商經過之情勢，國民黨竟幾處於被審判之地位。由於此次國民大會中少數挾制多數之事實，即足以證明國民黨立塲之無上艱苦與極端不利。此固國內國外政治經濟若干錯綜複雜重要因數之客觀環境有以醞釀湊合而成；但若干年來國民黨柄政之若千措施，未盡足以饜全國人民之望，亦爲無可諱言之事實。平心而論，此種事實，又由於不可抗力所造成者多，由於人謀之不臧者少。「不求有功，但求無過」，此應側重於個人之立身處世而言。若就國家政治與政黨柄政言，則有功爲應然之事，有過乃應負之責。况國民黨爲革命政黨，事求有功，志在負責，此於該黨及蔣主席歷來之文憲文吿足以　之。今少數黨對於久柄國政之多數黨，旣未忘其轟轟烈烈之大功，亦欲課其泄泄沓沓之實責，本不可謂爲不應有之事。在國民黨則旣未恃其功，亦不避其責，殷切制憲以還政於民，此正革命建國，有主義，有信仰之大黨精神，而此次國民大會之克奏膚功，殆即以此種精神爲指導之原則。中山先生不云乎？「夫革命事業，莫難於破壞，而莫易於建設。今難者旣成功（即如推翻滿淸。北伐。統一，抗戰勝利等）而易者反失敗，其故又何也？惟其容易也，故人多不知其必要而忽略之，此其所以敗也。何以謂之容易？因破壞已成，而阻力悉減，阻力一滅，則吾人無所不可，來往自由，較之謀破壞時，稍一不愼則不測隨之之際，何啻天淵？」（孫文學說第六軍）就此次國民大會之會議情緒言之，國民黨代表或不免自認爲失敗，而制憲偉業終克有成。是建設雖易，亦未常敗。前此一切阻力，旣已由國民黨悉加掃滅，奠定建設之基，則此後吾人來往自由，無所不可，若頒佈憲法，實行憲政之後，由於全國各當各派無黨無派所組織而成之民主政府，仍復無以舉統一和平之實，竟革命建國之功，則吾人忍讓謀國之精神又將何以自解於天下後世？此又作者於自勉之除，所願與國人共相警惕者也！</p>
<p>至若憲法內容若干曾經熱烈爭辯，反！更改之具體問題，如國體也，國都也，國民大會之租織與職權也，行政院與立法院之關係也，立法委員與監察委員之產生方法也，等等，若衡以中山先生五權憲法之理論，固不難建立一相當之準繩，但在民主會議之討論中，則亦初無絕對之標準。何也？政治本重妥協，民主允貴和諧。假使各方堅持成見，不相容忍，則根本不須有會。故就民主會議言之，凡爲大會所接受通過者，其理論或條文即爲會議所認爲優，爲是；反之，即爲劣，爲非。少數服從多數，固爲民主政治之通例；多數容忍少數，此乃現實情勢之特徵。正確之理論，固可推演而產生邏輯之事實；但當前之事實，亦必由於若干不可克服之客觀條件所形成。是故方今之時，在中國而言制憲，與其高談理論，實母寗，遷就事實之爲有利也。質之高明以爲何如？（民國卅五年十二月十九在於南京）</p>

<h3>民國卅五年度〔一〕政治協商會議　國內十大要聞</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>道一年中報紙上所載的新聞，佔篇幅最多亦最受人注意的，當然是國共間的和談問題。日本投降後的半年間，爲了中共軍阻止受降，弄得交通破壞，復員停滯，遍地烽火又起。到去年新年來到之時，方看見了一綫和平統一的曙光。政府和中共間經過了多决的磋商，更加馬歇爾元帥從中斡旋調解，終於一月十日在陪都重慶召開了政治協商會議，通盤商討軍事及政治上的各種問題‘參加約有國民黨，共產黨，靑年黨，民主同盟，及社會賢達等代表共三十八人。自一月十日至十九日共開了九次大會，十九日以後則分組在會外協商，至卅一日，於各項問題俱已獲得協議，乃舉行第十次大會，通過議決案，宣吿閉幕。政協決議所包括的範圍極廣，計分五項，一是關於政府組織，即改組國府委員會，擴充名額，容納各黨派，使國府委員會成爲最高國務機關。一是關於施政綱領，確定國家軍政，外交，經濟，財政等方針。三是關於軍事問題，政府及中共軍隊實行整編統編，軍隊國家化。四是關於國民大會，決定了國大召開的的日期，並擴充代表名額。五是關於憲法草案，則通過了若干點修改原則，由憲草審議會詳加研討，彙綜整理，提供國民大會採納。</p>
<p>這五大決議案，本已包含了國內戰後所遭逢的一切問題的解決辦法，如果各方能繼續保持政協開會時的融洽精神，並忠實履行決議案，則和平統一的目標，自不難達到。不幸政協所帶來的祥和之氣，不過是曇花一現，會甫一閉幕，東北的衝突即起，致使這勝利後的一整年，仍然是在漫天烽火中度過。</p>
<p>〔二〕國府還都</p>
<p>國民政府勝利還都大典，於去年五月五日在首都南京隆重舉行。自戰事發生以後，政府爲了長期抗戰，於二十六年十一月間移駐重慶。八年以後，日寇投降，勝利來臨，乃復凱旋南京。這在中華民族的歷史上，是怎樣一件意義深長的盛舉！</p>
<p>復員還都是一件十分艱巨的工作。這主要的是在交通方面。抗戰的八年間，交通的路綫和工具，有的被敵人摧毀了，也有的因爲要阻敵前進，被我們自動破壞了，現在勝利猝然來臨，自然一切都有點措手不及之感。</p>
<p>政府在三十四年九月間，即日本投降後一個月，即擬定了政府機關先後分路還都的計劃，並動員了所有的交通工具，積極進行。空運由重慶直飛南京，陸運則由重慶北上經西安潼關徐州而折入南京。其中最主要的還是水運，沒長江順流而下。這復員還都的工作，自三十四年九月間開始，到三十五年四月間，大體已經就緒，乃於五月五日在南京正式舉行還都大典。</p>
<p>還都典禮在陵園舉行。這一天晴空萬里，春陽當頭，陵園道上潔凈無塵，梧桐夾道。政府文武官員皆穿禮服，分列靈堂左右側。九時正，禮砲隆隆，典禮開始，由蔣主席夫婦率領文武百官向國父遺像行禮，並爲抗戰死難將士同胞我哀。禮成後，主席步出禮堂，向全國同胞宣吿正式還都。</p>
<p>五月五日，在南京十萬市民一和全國同胞心中，都是一國永遠値得紀念的日子。</p>
<p>（三）和談</p>
<p>從三十五年元旦到除夕，報紙上無一日沒有關於和談的消息。而結果，則除夕那天的局勢，和元旦日比較起來，又似乎一切仍舊，絲毫未見改善。</p>
<p>一月十日開始的政協會議，到卅一閉幕，通過了五項決議案。二月廿五日，由張治中，周恩來，馬歇爾三人所組織的軍事三人小組又正式簽訌了關於國共軍隊整編統編的方案。看情形，似乎和平應該很有希望。</p>
<p>三月初，蘇軍陸續自東北撤退，國軍依照中蘇條約前往接收，但事先偸運出關的中共部隊立即起而阻撓，攻略蘇重撤退以後的城市，於是釀成了東北全面的衝突。政協決議，整軍方案，一切都成了廢紙。</p>
<p>政府曾在六月七日頒發東北停戰令，以求獲致和平。軍事三人小組亦於六月廿三日恢復會議，進行談判，但時談時停，一無具體結果。</p>
<p>這情形一直拖到八月間。八月十三日，蔣主席發表了處理今後局勢的六項方針，於是和談又趨活躍。在方式上，政府方面主張進行五人會議，即是從改組政府着手，根本解決全盤問題；中共方面則主張開三人會議，只解決軍事問題。後來兩方面總算都同意了三人和五人會議同時這行，可是又爲了張家口的軍事衝突，談判又未曾繼續下去。周恩來到了上海，不再進行和談。</p>
<p>十月初，靑年黨民社黨及民盟等第三方面人士竭力從中斡旋，政府代表亦抵滬親邀。終於在十月廿一日大家回到了南京，重開談判。這個談判還是沒有成功，十一月十五日，國民大會開幕了，國民黨，靑年黨，民社黨都參加在內，中共則聲明不參加。十九日以後，周恩來回了延安，這一年斷斷續續的和談就此吿終。</p>
<p>（四）蔣主席六十壽辰</p>
<p>去年十月三十一日欣逢蔣主席六秩大慶，薄海同歡，全國都舉行盛大祝典，藉以表示敬崇主席的偉續豐功。其中尤以上海新聞界和敎育界人士所發動的「獻校祝壽」，歸爲意義深長，且獲得各地一致熱烈響應。除獻校以外，各省市縣更紛紛作紀念之舉，如：呈默聯合簽名祝壽册，建築壽堂，撰書壽屏，壽頌，壽序，壽畫，獻鑄銅像等等。事後，敎育部更定三十五年壽辰至三十六年壽誕間爲「獻校祝壽年」，以資永埀紀念。當華誕之辰，主席伉　偕馬歇爾特使夫婦，到無銀避壽，一時太湖風色，平添無很光彩。無錫縣政府縣黨部暨臨時縣參議會特發起在太湖中興建「萬壽橋」，以資紀念，更爲歷史留一佳話。〔下接第五版〕</p>

<h3>民主的憲法是經過漫長的道路而來</h3>
<p>— 立法委員　陳顧遠</p>
<p>中國國民黨本於旣定的方針，結束訓政還政於民在一九四六年十一月十二日召開國民大會，集合來自國內海外各地方及各黨派各職業與婦女軍隊各團體的代表於一堂，制定民主的憲法，這是我國數千年來空前的盛舉。顯遠躬逢其盛，出席大會，領會了民主政治的許多精義，學習了民主政治的許多技能，我猜，和我具有同樣感想的人當不在少。茲逢一九四七年元且且中華民國開國紀念日，把在此次大會所領會與學習的地方公開於讀者之前，或者比寫一篇空泛的紀念文字較爲合宜。</p>
<p>然而我個人是具有歷史薜的，故在寫出直接得自大會各角落的感想以前，很國意從中國民主政治的前頁說起。必須明瞭中國民主政治的史實，乃知其締造艱縱，正與歐美各國的經過相等；惟其求之也艱，自應愛之也深，今次國民大會制定出民主的憲法更是如何可喜的事！那麼，中國民主政治的前頁，是些什麼？簡單說來：</p>
<p>民主政治的起源，在中國正與世界各民族一樣，當部族國家時代，似已有了端倪，像尚書所載帝堯讓舜，詢諸四岳，盤庚遷都，詢諸國人，都不失爲民主政治的濫觴。然其時旣有國人野人之判，又有君子小人之別，部族會議縱然舉行，並非即爲全民會議，自亦不能認爲即係現代的民主。原始形態的民主，因部族人口加多，佔地日廣，而經濟的需要，生活的保衛又不容許永久滯留於部族國家時代，同時更無像近代有助於實施民主政治的種種便利條件，便隨着以君主爲中心權力的國家之出現，歸於湮沒。</p>
<p>在中國，雖不像歐洲國家經過君權至上的階段，但數千年中的政治，只有民本精神的表現，並無民治的要求，仍難稱其爲會有現代民主的觀念。民本主義不過爲「民有」「民享」兩個觀念的構成物，至多再加上」中國夷狄共存共榮」的一個觀念而已。因爲不會有「民治」的觀念在內，就連這中國夷狄共存共榮之民主觀念也被其冲淡了它的光榮色彩·我們知道：中國向有「民爲邦本」與「君亦民也」一類的話，這至多是偏於「民有」的觀念。並有「愛民」，「牧民」，「與民同樂一「好惡隨民」一類的話，這至多是偏於「民享」的觀念。換句話說：僅承認政治是人民所有的，政府是爲人民利益而存在的，至於政治須由人民自理，却絕無此種見解。因爲「政由民出」不啻表示人人都作了皇帝；那還了得！所以中國數千年來的所謂王道與仁政，誠然的束了不少君主，使其木敢明目張膽地作福作威，但這種糖衣的毒藥就斷送了人民對於民治的要求。請看：周厲王爲人民所逐，照理狠可有民治政體出現，其結果，人民仍推出貴族握政，號種共和。漢明兩代皆係平民革命成功，正可不必蹈帝王覆職，但仍皆抱「彼可取而代之」的心理，以暴易暴。降至近世，雖以接受西歐思潮的太平天國諸王，仍然依樣畫葫蘆要建立朝代，舍民主而自爲之，可見「政由民出一這一個觀念的薄弱了！</p>
<p>辛亥革命，推翻滿淸，革命先烈擲其頭顱，愛國志士竭其血汗，纔創立中華民國；然人民由數千年君主政治的覊絆中，一躍而爲共和國的主人，旣無負荷政治的能力，又無過問政治的興趣，一切權力當然要落在野心家手中，禍亂相尋，勢不容已。國父預見於此，便以軍政時期實現革命之破壞，以訓政時期進行革命之建設，以憲政時期完成革命之目的，程序井然，莫可踰紊。訓政並非專政，乃領導人民走上民主道路，而還政於民，與各黨派同立於民主的憲法之下，實其終極之目的。中國國民黨源本未以政權自私，訓政亦係義務而非權利；若不是外患之來則憲政實施己有十年，若不是勝利後各黨派間的固執己見，則憲法制定亦早半年。終因國民革命是出於大公，發於至誠，在勝利後爲願全各黨派的意見，不惜國大一再延期，求取國內和平，最後終得到賢明的黨派及無黨無派的社會賢遠之合作，大會開幕，制定憲法。對於不提出名單的黨派，仍然　席以待，望其參加。同時，政府提出的憲法草案處處保持政治協商會議決定的原則。爲了這端，中國國民黨的高級幹部，不知費了多少精神，開了多少會議，　　向自己的黨員勸吿，望其順　　通過這部民主的憲法。這種趙黨派利益的容忍態度，是把　－民主政治的真諦，在世界其他　國的政黨方面，恐怕也很少見。今　中國，結束了中國國民黨的訓政，開始全民政治，然其經過實貝有悠長的艱苦歷史，並且實了不少的折衝，耗了不少的心慮，究竟達到直接還政於民之目的，使全國人民個個都處於皇帝的地位，這是我們對於結束訓政，還政於民，召開國民大會，制定民主憲法－此一開始的盛舉首先所領會的。</p>
<p>誠然！國父雖定出訓政的階段，而因內憂外患的關係，未能完全達到訓政預期的成效，原也不能否認，這或不免减低民主政治實施的效率。但全國人民旣希望早日還政於民，中國國民黨並不以訓政自私，倘無日寇深人，早已結束訓政；然在此抗戰期間，國民會政會的召開，省縣參議會的建立，爲民主政治却也造成不少的橋樑與基礎。况且經赤訓政時期的結果，人民已充分具有過聞政治的興趣，可謂已經成功過半，至於負荷政治的能力縱不健全，也可逐漸從學習中得來·今次國民大會之開，可以說是人民對於過問全國政治的第一次學習。其實社會天天向前開展，時代日日向前進步，人類隨時在學習中，原非限於領會了民主政治的意味，纔學習民主政治的技能。</p>
<p>（二）不特有話大家說，還得大家有飯喫</p>
<p>其次，我個人原是出身於北京大學政治學系的，並且担任政治學系不助敎數年，截至民國十九年以前，在上海各大學教書都是政治學系的課程，之後，雖以法律學爲主，仍未完全擺脫政治學系方面的科目。所以我第二個感想，就領會到中國今後的民主政治至少是含有三方面的意義，除了政治上的民主以外，並須以國際上的民主爲念，更須以經濟上的民主爲貴。必須這樣，纔是最完善的民主政治，這在此次制定憲法的時候，充分地流露出來。我們知道：政治生活在社會現象中，有如人身的皮膚筋骨，非此，即不能保衛身體，支持身體，一切器官皆無所託，誠然是很重要了。但類似腦髓神經的民族精神及文化生活，類似血液循環的經濟生活，在一個人的思慮運動及滋養健康方面，更與皮膚筋骨同其價値。所以民主政治雖以政治上的民主爲基幹，而國際上的民主與經濟上的民主，仍然不可偏廢。三民主義的民族主義，民權主義，民生主義，就是針對這三方面而存在的；它比較民有民治民享的觀念更廣闊，包括民主的全部意義在內。</p>
<p>民族主議使國內各民族，平等地構成中華國族，輿世界各民族共同生存；就是說發揚固有文化，且推動世界文化的交流，求取自已民族的生存，亦絕不妨害他民族的生存。遵守國際的章，扶持弱小民族，這是將國際上的民主，首先求之於我；中國過去與他族共存共榮的理想也就由此而發揮出來。所以民族主義不僅國內各民族一律平等，且奠定國際上民主的基石。倘忽略此一觀念，只求取政治上經濟上的民主，便成爲偏面的民主，在全人類的立塲上實無可貴之處。况且在實際上，不以國際上的民主爲念，在國內也未必眞能走上民主的道路，過去的侵略國家，便是很好的榜樣。至於政治與經濟兩個意義上的民主更是不應偏重在某一方面。一般資本主義國家的民丰，有話大家說，在表面上何嘗不重視民治的精神？然而大多數人民空有其權，實際的利益　在大資本家手裹，難怪有人說這樣的民主是不澈底的。若干社會主義國家的民主，大家有飯喫，在實際上何嘗不重視民享的精神？然而一般人不能參與其「慮始」，僅依其所示不而樂其成，難怪有人說爲樣的民主是失其眞諦的。蓋各獲得民主的一部分，自有種缺陷露出，必須含有三方面的意義在內，然後纔是眞爲人類所需要的民主政治。</p>
<p>今次制定的民主的憲法，開宗明義的前言裏已經宣示是依據</p>
<p>孫中山先生創立中華民國之遺敎而制定，民主的三方面意義皆吸收在憲章裏。條文裏處處重視全民政治的精神，是加強政治上民主的效力，這不用多說。關於外交的態度，經濟的措施，在表面上似屬政策性質，不必定入憲法，然究以其爲民主政治所不可缺少的部分，自不能破壞鼎立之局，造成跛足之喩。雖在討論期間，大家不惜熱烈　難，有所爭執，無非求其如何規定，在技術上始覺妥切，而對於這樣根本的大原則却均無異議。中國今後民主政治的開展，不特澈底實現全民政治，求得經濟平等，抑且扶護世界的和平，保陣國際的安寗；這又是我們對於結束訓政，還政於民，召開國民大會，制定民主憲法——此一開始的盛舉所須領會的。</p>
<p>此一壯嚴偉大的民主憲法，雖由國父預先啓示了它的精神，使民主向着三方面進展。然而我想來自民間的代表不必各個都對憲法學有深刻的研究，未必統統注意到民主的各方面意義。就通我個人平常談起民主，也隨俗地着重民治觀念，往往將國際上民主，經濟上民主的觀念忽略。經過大會中廣泛討論和各組審查的種種階段，從蒙藏代表職業代表等等發言方面，無論我對其發言的評判如何，皆使我深刻的領會到民主拴貌是含有三方面的意識。集千百人的見解，供每個人的學習，我想任何人出席今次大會後，憑着一種領會力，縱對於憲法學問不成爲內行，至少對於中國今後的民主政治必更有密切的認識。不知固亦能行，能行必更能知，一切一切的領會，又是得力於學習而然。</p>
<p>（三）一切爲了國家，一切爲了民主</p>
<p>今次國民大會制定的憲法，就其本身觀察，這是一部民主的憲法。龐德敎授說：「中國需要一種具有中國性格，合乎中國國情的中國憲法，不必抄襲外國；」又說「三權制並非民主或立憲政治的必要條件。」那麼，最合乎中國國情的，當然是由中國人民原有的文物制度中及傳統的理想中而形成的五權憲法了。然而因爲各黨派不願完全接受五權憲法的理論，便不能拘泥自己的理想而固執之。民主政治的精神，是要犧牲自己主張，是要容忍他人見解，尤其憲法是國家根本大法，是全國人民所遵守的，超乎一切黨派階級宗族的利益，不能不虛懷若谷。人家講得對，有道理，我們自然屈從，就是有些理論在我們看來不甚可採，但人家必要堅持，而對我們的理想並無多大妨害，也不妨予以採納。一切爲了國家，一切爲了民主。換句話說，憲法是全國性的，而我們需要的民主憲法旣不是欽定憲法的性質，又不像英國憲法基於歷史背景，由其人民屢次以一致的行動向政府爭來的條款，自然不能使各個參加制憲的人都能滿意。所以縱然自由制憲，出於「民定憲法」的形式，但紛歧的意見更是多有，惟在服從多數的決議，纔能搆成共同的意志；若就其本來的意見言，任何人都有不滿意的地方。何况中國在勝利以後，爲了達到和平統一的目的，政府黨與各黨派舉行政治協商會議，決定憲法草案的原則，雖不能拘束國民大會的制憲，但就黨派的立塲上言，却充分具有協定憲法的意味，乃是一種事實。旣然出於協定，五權固然不成其爲五權，三權依樣不成其爲三權，各採其長，各舍其短，容忍爲國，以求民主政治實現。雖然對於素所信仰的黨的主義不免隱痛難言，然而爲了國家迅速走入民主政治道路，使這部民主的憲法很順利的完成，只有捐棄自己的成見，遵循政協約原則，一切毀譽聽諸後人批評罷了！報館記者　向我詢及對大會的意見，我就說道：「後客觀的態度上制定百年大法，於和諧的空氣中開闢萬世太平」。雖然一部憲法不一定有百年的效力，由此憲法而致的太平更不能有萬世的延綿，但客觀的態度，和諧的空氣，在制定憲法時候，如眞爲了民主精神的表現，倒是不可欠缺的因素。</p>
<p>憲法旣是超黨派的，超階級的，超宗族的東西，那麼，凡是參加制憲的人自然是爲了國家的根本大法而來，爲了全國人民的利益而來。縱然產生的方法不同的黨派代表，社會賢達代表；有有是由特選　而來的婦女代表，軍隊代表；但皆爲國民的代表，時時要替全國老百姓講話，不能以自己產生的單位不同，自視奇特於他人。國民代表是全國國民的代表，並非所產生單位之一部分人民的代表，區域代表職業代表如此，就是遴選特選的代表更非如此解釋，不能說明其代表國民之意義安在。那麼，黨派之私，階級之見，宗族之別，以及區域之分，更無理由使其超越國家的利益。所以憲法的制定必須在和諧的空氣中，以客觀的態度，爲條款的處理；我屢次在大會審查會發言，往往偏於折衷方面，希望大家都過得去，報紙上雖以善於排難解紛爲譽，在我個人看來有時候却也不得不然。不過在實際上，發言的人有時候或就着自己的本行，或就着自己所管的部門，或就着某一宗族某一區域的利益，有所爭持主張，這在表面上看來，似乎爲了一部分的利益而出此，然仔細觀察，却也不盡其然，不能專從皮相上淺視了這類發言價值。我們知道憲法具有全國性，籠罩了各職業各部門各宗族各區域的利益在內，倘對於有一方而的規定不健全，勢必影響全國的康寗。本行的人知道本行的情形最深，一部門的人知道本部門的事實最多，各宗族區域方面，亦復如此，開會的意義就在博採衆議，不愁其說話，而愁其不能多說話。只要他們的主張能取得會塲的同情，或經他人反駁後，不再堅持而知其主張有待商榷，都是可贊貴的意見；至多只能稱其爲短視，却不能完全認其爲自私，這是我的看法。</p>
<p>一部主民主的憲法是綜合各方面的意見而成，雖然都是針對着國家的利益與全民的幸福發言，但在討論時並不因虛心聽取他人的主張，而即將自巴主張不予以充分發揮，蓋眞理愈辯而愈明，自己的主張果爲正確，即應向大衆宣示，縱不爲人重視，也要抱着能爭取若干同情便爭取若干的心理，而一吐爲快。這次大會的廣泛討論，發言的一百二十餘位代表，不問黨派，宗族，區域，職業，婦女，都各暢其所言，形成空前論戰。這種廣泛討論多少影響了憲草的修正，其功效可减少將來對於憲法的解釋，並减少將來對憲法修正的條款。憲法利用解釋改變原來條款的意義，究竟是一種變通辦法：憲法條款一經制定頒佈後，再來修正也是萬不得已的辦法；所以在制定憲法時候，能想到的問題總應說到藉供大家的參考，採與不採，待諸公決。因而我爲某報記者詢問我對大會的意見，又答覆了下面的兩句話：「憲法在討論時，個人應盡量發揮自已的主張，在表決後，少數應絕對服從多數的意志」。</p>
<p>然而這一切一切，我們不特應該深有領會，並且希望不斷地學習，好來推動道部民主的憲法之實施。</p>
<p>（四）文質彬彬地於平凡中求表現</p>
<p>民主政治的運用，雖不必皆賴於會議，但會議的舉行究便於民主精神的表現；尤其國民大會的公開，制定民主的憲法，更可從這次大會各角落中領會了不少關於民主政治的精義，學習了不少關於民主政治的技能。現在，歸納地說在下面：</p>
<p>民主性的會議出席的人數不怕多，只怕沒有秩序，沒有紀律。會議是有組織性的，如能控制會塲的秩序維持會塲的紀律絕不應該患出席人數之多。以中國地方之大，人口之衆，而制憲工作如此之要，兩千零五十名代表，能嫌其人數過多嗎？然而這衆多代表集於一堂討論議案，不特在中國爲創舉，抑且非世界各國所常見，因而控制會塲的秩序，維持會塲的紀律，當然是種繁難的事。但是從大體上說來，一切還好；倘再和以前舊國會的開會比較那更進步得狠快，這不能不說是經過訓政階段的成績。大家總都記得：舊國會的開會，時常發生打架流血的事，每個議員桌子上的墨盒子，最後都被嵌牢於桌面，不敢再讓它自由飛舞，變成凶器。當日，我還在北大讀書，有一决前往旁聽，正值政府提出任命，周自齊爲財政總長，精求國會同意，台下擁護反對之聲，同時發出，議員們且多離座，鬧做一團，最後　然而散。我旁聽之后，狠爲失望，曾說過一句話，「這樣的亂七八糟，連我們學生開會都不如」；然而他們的全體出席也不過幾百人，竟這樣的沒有秩序與紀律！今次，國火經常有一千數百人出席，對秩序都能相當遵守，雖然偶有呼喊或噓聲之發，但一推測其由來，在任何會議中也不能免。呼喊之起，大都由於議事程序上的爭執，不迅速呼喊便不能挽救；否則也是屬於不平之鳴一類的呼聲。（下接第三版）</p>

<h3>民主政治的領會與學習</h3>
<p>— 立法委員　陳顧遠</p>
<p>（上接第二版）</p>
<p>嚧聲之發大都由於發言人的理論，不順一部分代表的耳，而又超過發言時間强自說下去，就不免有此反感。有時候廠聲噓得過當，鄰座代表爲制裁噓聲，陷在有關秩序的問題中。爲維持秩序而反發生秩序問題，這是一個例子。但這些偶然的現象，經過主席團的善自處理，與代表間的自相檢點，終於减少了許多。此外，大會秘書處並特別爲各代表印送民權初步摘要一書，供各代表手頭的檢閱，俾會議處處能表現其組織性，而有助於民主化會議的成功。因爲在最初幾次大會中，各代表每依民權初步所示，糾正程序上的錯誤，而全會塲估計其應能熟讀民權初步的代表不過佔百分之四十餘，其眞能依民權初步運用自如的代表，恐怕還難達到此數。至於純然來自民間的代表當然更多有漠然民權初步的使用者。在會議中，人人手執此書，一面學，一面用，對於民主政治的推動更收到會議技術上的宏效。</p>
<p>民主性的會議的出席人，不問你來自某方，不問你社會地位如何，旣然都是代表任何人在以代表的資格出席會議時，絕不應有優越感，更不應卑視他人。民主的眞諦首先要能尊重他人的人格，尊重他人人格即是尊重自己人格；所以他人的發言，絕不可因其人微而輕其言，成示以不屑爲聽之態。縱然，在發言技術上不狠高明，，在持論的理由上不甚充足，但未必沒有一得之見可採，縱不然，也可以用而反證自己的見解高明。能虛心聽取他人的意見，這是在會議中能尊重他人人格的一種表現，而爲實現民主精神的要着。反過來說，自己旣知別人一樣，別人要遵守的規則，自己也得遵守，不能獨求其異。民主的會議中，絕不應有「鶴立鷄羣」的自豪，只能以「分庭抗禮」自處，自卑固然貶落自己的人格，自豪亦足損害他人的人格。譬如說，在討論議案時的發言時間，除了報吿，質答的性質以外，每人以五分鍾爲限，這是爲保障發言的平均機會起見，不得不如此。這個法定時間，載在議事規則上，任何人都應遵守，除非主席特別許可，或全塲一致擁護你繼續發言下去，纔可超過五分鐘。斷不可自認爲優越於他人，或自認爲自己的道理絕對地對，可以不遵守道種限制，那就錯了，須知要言不煩，正不必拖泥帶水；縱有深刻理論有待詳定，也可用別的方法表現，不必佔了他人發言的時間。我在廣泛討論時候一次發言，因發言請求單遁交主席，三天以後纔輪到我，有此充裕時間，確實費了多少腦筋，讓發昔的內容，每個字不要虛說，恰恰配合五分鐘的發言時間，僥倖地得到與會人的好評。由此便領會到在民主的作風下，只有從平凡中求表現，而表現的技能更要深刻學習，不可置而不顧。</p>
<p>（五）是全民政治，是多數政治，是人人有份的政治</p>
<p>民主政治是全民政治，是要以全民的利益爲利益；但在全民之中，總有多少分子須待扶持與護助，然後纔能眞正達到維護全，利益之實際目的。所以我在大會裏對於婦女代表爭示選舉名額，對於蒙職代表要求各種扶助，不特表示同悄，並且自動地有種折衷的提案。我總覺得；法律上的平等是形式的，還須針對事實做到實際上的平等，纔算澈底。雖然站在純理論的立塲上，婦女當選名額的規定，似乎反而失去平等的意義；但是站在純事實的立塲上，這種名義上的平等究對婦女有什麼好處？我又覺得覺蒙藏的情形旣爲特殊，要求在憲法上求得一種保障，原也應該，不能因爲猜疑他們別有懷抱，連應有的合理規定都不給。他們旣出席國大，參加制憲，必係自認爲中華國族的一份子繞來，我們總得體念國父遣志，特別愛護他們，扶助到底。至於肚會安全，農工利益，在這次大會裏，多少代表都是特別注意，我也深切表示同情。雖然，種種有關的提案不必採入憲法條款之內，但衆議會同，都領會到它是今後民主政治運用中一個主要的方向。</p>
<p>民主政治在意見的決定上又是多數人的政治，所以一種主張的取得同情，是先要取得多數人的瞭解，至於其主張的本身究竟有如何價值，那倒是第二步的問題。在今次大會的廣泛發言時候，一位代表提出「預備總統」四字，全塲哄然，他又說「大家不要笑，國父最初提出五權憲法的時候，大家也很奇怪」，全塲更笑。其實平心靜氣而想，他的用意未嘗不無可取之點，只因他漢視總統的聲望乃由於平日社會的地位養成，不能用儲才的辦法，讓他在「預備總統」的地位上，養成堪任總統的聲望。縱然道位代表更有其他理由，仍可從別的地方想出辦法，倒不必在今次大會突然搬出這位陌生的「預備總統」來；爲大家所奇怪·同時，有位代表提出「憲法施行法」的名稱來，這在學法律的人看，從沒有聽過這一名稱；因爲憲法的如何施行，只能在憲法的施行一章定，或由制憲的人議決一種過渡辦法，然而它在性質上仍屬於憲法的一部分，並非像民刑法另有其施行法的。但在會塲的代表，旣都感覺到憲草上對於憲法的施行規定，不甚充密，而如何施行倒是有待解決的問題，因而此言一出，全塲鼓掌，法律上先例之創，往往由此。可知在民主的會議中，一種主張想要爲人重視，就得爭取多數人的同情，管卞說「民別而聽之則愚，合而聽之則聖」，聖之所在就是有了多數人的支持。有了多數人的支持，縱然不是眞理也是眞理。除非你有特立獨行的精神離開這種會議，纔可使你自信以爲眞理的論調，不受與會人的冷視。</p>
<p>民主政治在另一面又是人人有份的政治，因而在民主政治下的活動是要有準備，並要有　極前進的勇氣；中國讀書人的以退爲進的辦法，或者希望人家自動地來捧塲的辦法，那是絕對做不到的。當民國二十六年各地選舉國民大會代表的時候，我旣離不開我的工作崗位，跑回家鄉去活動，而且覺得單刀匹馬地幹，未必沒有成就，還着有須競選的事向不參加，所以就沒有進行。前年一病前後九個月，幾乎蹺了辮子，病愈之後，認爲還歲月可以努力。除進行自己在學術方面的體系外，對於實際政治也感着興趣。適逢去年四月間，中國國民黨的出席國大代表要在立法委員中選出十七名，十五日於行都中央黨部禮堂競選，事先經朋友們爲我活動，差幸當選第三名。但是今次大會開幕，起首就是主席團候選人的選舉，不特我仍然抱着冷淡的心，就是立法院其他十六位同人同樣以不適宜於從事民主政治的作風，未作主席團候選人的競選。後來，綜合審查委員會的委員是山各單位推選三人，這對於技術方而的問題，較能各審查委員會的召集人關係允爲重大，我倒很想參加進去；並且希藉由立法院選出的十六位同人統統能如此，在技術方面總多少有點貢獻。我的單位是國民黨，二百多名代表，人才濟濟，不敢作此妄想。心想，由某某單位產生，但此單位中一位代表以我爲遴選爲對，我就未敢再爲進行。然而仍有多少朋友爲我活動，且吿訴我業已成功，不料臨時有人提議應在該省南中北三區中分別推出，即將名單送交主席團。我的朋友聞訊，擬推翻此種決定，實行票選，我以旣已決定，何必認眞，只怪我事先沒有積極地向人競選罷了。各審查委員會依法，每組推選二人參加，綜合查委員會，我又將此舉忽略，第一次開會時因事先並未通知投票，臨時措手不及，到了第三審查委員會的地方，正在投票，一無希望。再轉到第一審查委員會的地方將要投票，此際某某單位有兩三位代表臨時在塲爲我活動，只得十六票落選。我在塲中，還碰見二十餘年未見面的北大同班的同学，總覺得和人初次見面不好意思將競選的事吿知，這不知喪失了幾票。和我同時來第一審查會的朋友，他認識的人狠多，我却忘記吿訴他想競選，臨時尋他，他又離開了會塲。道又是我對民主政治的一個不習慣的弱點，由此種種也就深刻地領會到在民主政治中應有如何的作法，一切一切還得學習。</p>
<p>（六）介紹一位陌生活的同伴－器治</p>
<p>末了，我還有一點感想要附帶地寫出來：</p>
<p>我是五四時代的學生，當時所擁護的兩位先生，一個是德先生，一個是賽先生，換句話說，就是民主與科學。科學固不必限於在民主社會中纔有進展，而民主則必賴有科學的輔助，乃能加旨。尤其中國土地之廣，人口之衆，要充分表現民主政治的精神，更非如此不可。今次國民大會的召開，不管你住在天南海北，都能迅速地接到召集令，都能敏快地來京出席，這是靠了料學之暢，在交通方面有其成效，不用說了。再看，容納二千數百人的會堂，在討論與表決時，要是沒有播音器與表決器的話，其困難不知道要有多少。表決還可用起立或舉手的辦法行之，但點算數目，荒廢時間，已經令人頭痛，而準確與吾也大成問題。如今有了表決器，懸在當塲，衆目所視，旣準確又迅速，這是多數人集會表決時所必要的工具。其次像討論時候的發言，要使全塲的人皆聽得着，離了播音器的使用，坐在最後的人就如同看無聲電影一樣，便完全失了發言意義。因而我覺得向來對於管理事物的見解，不特主張仿照新生活運動的標語，應使法治禮治人治鼎足而三，並應使法治禮治人治及器治驥足而四，在今次大會中又得了一種證明。「明禮義，」－可說是「禮治」；「知廉恥負責任」－可說是「人治」；「守紀律」－可說是「法治」；一切一切要科學化，那就是「器治」。</p>
<p>民主政治的推進離不開法治，任何人皆知，今次國民大會制定憲法，在政治意義上是民主的演奏，在法律意義上便是制定國家根本大法，保障民主政治的實施，而爲法治的根源所在。就以大會的本身而論，有國民大會組織法確定了代表們的職權範圍等等，右國民大會議事規則，規律了制憲進行中的各種程序，然則在制憲這件事情的管理方面，不是法治是什麼，倘以注意到民主精神而忽略了法治精神，那便成了趕塲的烏合之衆了。那麼，對於禮治又怎么說？因爲古代，法字限於刑事法，刑事法以外的民事法政事法都歸之於禮，故在實質上禮仍然含有法的成分。儒家輕視刑治，故反對法治，抬高禮治。現代，法的施圍廣闊，政事法民事法刑事法皆在其內，似無再提倡禮治的理由。然普通所謂法治，只是指着依制定法管理事物而言，習慣法條理法都置之於外，仍然不够運用。依「禮以行義」「體以義起」及「禮也者理也」諸種見解，並木於「行而宜之之謂義」的註釋，法治以外，更必同時有禮治存在，以補其不足。今次國民大會由政府提出的憲法草案，是以政治協商會議決定的原則爲藍本，政治協商會議於法針據，但爲實現民主政治在政治的道理上，却不能不經過此一階段，這就是體。不然，五五憲草早已依法公布，且向民衆宣傳多年，又何必於短促時間內而爲五五憲草的根本修正呢？再以大會的本身而論，議事除了議事規則之法的根據外，並須恪守民權初步之所示。民權初步雖不是形式上的「法律」，却是行使民權在程序上應當遵守的道理，這種管理上的規則，吾無以名之，名之且禮治。他如出席大會的簽到，開會讀國父遺囑時的全體起立，主席宣吿散會後的散會，這更不是法治而應列於禮治之內。然後再說到人治，人治就是德治，無管法治禮治都是要由人推動，所以在管理事物上，人治的要素也不可缺。換句話說，雖以法律爲百度之準，但無治人，便難免舞文亂法；雖以禮義求萬事之宜，但無治人，也不能探玄得奧。今後國大制定憲法，於種種困難之中，委曲求全，不願違反政協案的原則，以昭大信，這就是人治的一種表現。法治也，禮治也，人治也，表面上是鼎足而三，實際上是三位一體，如再加上科學化之器治，對於管理任何事物必更有充分的成效。在民主政治方面尤其如是。</p>
<p>爲　足之一的器治，發揮民主政治的效能，在　次大會中充分地表現出來，無待多說。然而它仍舊是要配合法治總治人治同時　在，乃有其用，却又不可不　。有器治而無法治的話！管你什麼法律，我唯武力是視，科學便成爲殺人利器，像侵略國家不守國際公法，危害世界民主，已是狠明顯的事。在　次大會裘，　有播音器的設置，解除了聽聞上的困難；假如沒有議事規則，或有議規則而不遵守；那麼，幾個播音器擺在各方，大家搶着發言，各佔一器，相爭以聲，播音器的絲毫作用也就沒有了。同樣，如主席違背了法定的表決程序而提付表決，已迅速地有人按了電紐，適在此時有人找出程序上的錯誤，經衆附議，這一决的表決雖然利用了表決器，紅燈仍擺在我們而前，依然無效。有器治而無禮治的話；管你什麼道理，我唯利用機器生產，榨取大衆的資產與血汗；像資本主義國家制定保護資本家利益的法律，漢視經濟方面的民主原則，又是很昭著的事。在今次大會裏，有多少人忽略播音器之理的所在，或使用大嗓，或置身太近，都使發言輸送到聽者耳邊，反不淸楚，我最初也不習慣用這個東西，在發言台上擺來擺去，如同上課堂情形，閙了一决笑話。說到表決器的使用，因在中國還是初决，多少人不習慣，秘書處特別爲這印有簡單說明，並指定一位幹事在大會口頭解說。然而在實際使用時候，有的說「按電紐，」有的說「按電鈴，」有的說「按表決器，」還是不能一效。這些事物方而的道理，說在管理方面就是　治的一端。禮爲事之宜，隨時有新的發現，所以我們也隨時地學習。有器治而無人治的話：其情形與有法治或禮治而無人治正同，徒法固不定以自行，徒禮固不足以應變，徒器亦不足以談民主，福人類。在今次大會裏，假如有人不守會塲秩序，利用播音器爲口角相爭，或隨便到播音器前呌喊，那倒不如沒有它，還洛得淸靜。這雖是我假想的話，亦可見治人對於器的關係之重要了。再看表決器，因各個座位接連，而請假缺席的人又時有之，假如表決時，有人按了自已的電紐以後，又技了空座上的電紐，也是無從查考，這種責任就要由個人自己依據道德上的責任而負。這些塲合，雖以器爲治，但仍不能脫離以人爲治的關係。</p>
<p>總之，我這次出席國民大會的惑想一時也寫不完，而且寫這　稿子是在正式討論憲草審查結果以前，漢然還不免有多少感想，繼續湧於我的腦海之中。但歸根一句話，在這次數千年來的空前盛會中，對我最幸運的事情，不外民主政治的領會與學習罷了。（民國三十五年十二月十八日）</p>
<h3>經濟革析的途徑</h3>
<p>— 經濟學專家　萧錚</p>
<p>危機的解決途徑</p>
<p>當前的經濟，已面臨嚴重關頭。大多數人民的生計，瀕於絕境，國家的存立，是要發生間題的。這實際危機的釀成，固是包含着錯綜複雜的多種原因，但其中最重要的因素，是農業經濟的破壞。</p>
<p>中國經過三十五年的內戰和外禍，農業經濟的組織，隨着國家社會組織而破壞，但成爲最難恢復的一環，今日所看見普遍的工商業衰落，都市失業衆多，以及全國的飢餓與貧窮，都是農業經濟破壞後應有的現象，故論現階段中國的經濟危機，不能不先將目光貫注於國富所在的農業，然後才能求出根本解決的途徑。</p>
<p>中國是農業國家，大衆所依賴的生活基礎是農業。但今日的世界是高度的工業生產，人類生活慾望已非原始的農業生產所能滿足。因之中國如要趕上世界，必非僅維持原來的農業生產所能做到，如要中國走上工業的道路，又必須爲工業原料的農業，能有標準的大量增產。而爲農業與工業間之脈絡的交通與水利二大事業，又爲其先決條件。因之，今日由國經濟要從根做起，必須採取下列諸步驟：（一）變更農業制度（包括土地制度）使農業生產合於工業的儒要。（二）從大量興修鐵道與水利，以促起基本工業。（三）以改善農民生活（從興建農村房屋製造傢具與農品等）促起國內工商業。（四）從改製農產品促起對外貿易。這四項的目的，是一致的，是從改善農業來促起工業，繁榮農村來救濟今日要破產的都市，從改善農民生活來求全國人民生活水準的提高。</p>
<p>二，經濟革新的指導原則</p>
<p>爲挽回經濟總崩潰的命運，然本一着，乃在不惜任何代價，先求國家統一、與社會安定，以恢復國家組織與社會組織，然後方可進一步談經濟的革新。經濟革新必須有指導原則；</p>
<p>第一要確立方針，我們經濟最高指導原則，當然是民生主義，但民生主義如何解釋，顏易使人迷惑，爲了明確切實計，應加註明：（一）我們的經濟路綫非資本主義，亦非共產主義，而是以求經濟和諧爲主的調節主義。所以我們一切經濟措施，是必須依據於調節主義出發的節制資本平均地權兩大政綱，否則便要陷入歧途。（二）我們的經營方法，非自由主義亦非統制主義，應爲依據調節主義而來的計劃經濟。自由主義之生產和分配的無政府，統制主義足以窒息生產與使分配官僚化，均爲識者所共病，我們應將包含有自由經濟與統制經濟之長的計劃經濟，始能迎頭趕上世界新的經濟路綫。（三）我們的企業主體，應非純粹國營亦非純粹私營，應爲兼收並蓄的公私共營制度。純粹國營要走入共產主義。純粹私營，即是資本主義。我們要就事業範圍的大小，性質的累重，以及有否獨佔性，分別將企業歸於國營或私營。並要以國營來領導私營事業，要以私營企業來輔助國營。這幾種方針，便是經濟改革的第一前提，也就是挽救當前經濟危機的指導燈。</p>
<p>第二要樹立政策。經濟是國計民生的全貌，經濟政策即是國策的本體。故言經濟政策，分之爲經濟各部門的活動目標，合之即爲一個國策。我們的立國方針旣是三民主義，我們的經濟政策，即是民生主義實行的方策。因之；（一）必須着眼於求國民生計的均足，樹立土地政策勞働政策與金融政策，換言之，經濟生產的三大要素土地勞力和資本必須置於一貫的政策之下求達到國民生計均足的目的。（二）必須着眼於擴大生產樹立農業政策工業政策貿易政策和交通政策。舉凡農工商交通運輸方面的措施，必須集中一個統一的目標，以一切可能的方法、短期中盡力擴大生產我們的經濟危機，才有救藥。（本）必須從公平分配着眼，樹立社會政策與財政政策。生產的擴充，不致造成分配的畸形，即在於社會政策和財政政策的充分發揮。這些經濟政策的配合發展，即爲一本開國策。</p>
<p>三，經濟革新的具體實施</p>
<p>經濟革新，我們不僅僅要提示出指導原則，並且要確定一個切實的實施辦法，方能眞實排除當前的經濟危機。我主張：</p>
<p>第一，確立計劃經濟的體系。（一）確定實施計劃經濟之最高權力機關。（二）配合國家經濟建設需要，實施人力物力財力之逐步淸查，並確定人力物力財力密切配合之預計制度。（三）將全國分爲東南，東北，西北，西南，華北，華中，華南等七經濟區，設督導機構，依據建設總計，充分發展各該區域經濟之特點，並依國防需要，調劑各設區城農礦工商之設施。（四）規定在一定年度內各區各項生產最低限額，並定其運輸配銷之方法。（五）一切交通運輸，金融，賦稅，及勞工管理之措施，均應依前項需要，重加配置與調整。</p>
<p>第二，以實施農地改革建設新農業制度爲計劃經濟的中心：（一）於三年內儘先完成蘇北·皖北·陝北·及山東·河北·與東九省之農地改革，使農地移轉爲自耕農所有，以合作農塲制度，擴充田塲，並遂步實轉機器耕作。（二）全國其餘地區之農地改革與新農業制度，依前條辦法，逐漸分區推行。發展農業特產並調劑其缺陷。（三）實施農地改革與新農業制度後之剩餘勞力，應移殖於東北·西北·及西南各區，其一切房屋器具及種子肥料，由國家預爲購備，並實施定貨制度，以救濟目前工商業。（四）實施農地改革後之土地資金亦即地主所得收回之地價，應由國家討劃引導其投入公營事業，並實行保本保息使地主階層，逐漸成爲工商企業者。</p>
<p>第三，就實施新農業制度，計劃工礦貿易交通等事業之發展並嚴格執行之。（一）就實施新農業制度，預計機器肥料及房屋·傢具等之需要量，由國家定貨制（限於國內），使各關係工商業，立即開始積極生產。（二）就實施新農業制度，重行配置交通，金融及其他各種公共設備，由國家立即開始築路濬河墾荒建屋等工作，使剩餘勞力充分就業，並使義務勞力，充分發揮。（三）就新農業制度實施後所得之增加生產量，計劃加工製造並籌備其電氣油煤及機器等之供應。（四）就新生產量計劃進出口貿易額，並籌劃國內集散市塲之倉庫運輸設備、指導人民經營之。</p>
<p>第四，籌劃實施計劃經濟之經費來源，並穩定貨幣發行限額：（一）實施計劃之最初兩年費用，應以募捐公債與外債及獎勵投資方式吸收遊資供應之。（一切公營之鐵路·礦山·農塲·工廠等均允許有一定比例之民股·此種民股並應保本保息。）（二）實施計劃後，以增加生產量爲再生產之資本。（三）法幣之法行，應於計劃經濟實施前確定限額，嗣後應僅依生產增加之比例，方得增加　行。</p>

<h3>怎樣建立科學與政治間的合理關係</h3>
<p>— 中央研究院研究員　言任地質調查所所長　九贊動</p>
<p>烽火漫天，烟雲蔽日，一幅天朗氣清春光明媚的圖畫，距離現實尙有十萬八千里。希望三十六歲的中華民國以筋鬥雲的速度快快走完這十萬八千里！</p>
<p>现代政治影響到每一個人的生活和工作，科學家當然不能例外。政治的內容千頭萬緒，有很多部門需要各種專家通才參加設計執行，科學家遂也不得不積極參與政治，甚至在某些事業上應該佔在決策的地位，問題纔能解決，事業纔能順利進行。在如今世界上，科學與政治間是具有密切關係的。二者間的關係導入正規，使之合理，結果是政治昌明，科學發達；不入正規，不能合理，則政洽混亂，科學無法進展·為建立二者間的合理關係要有一個超然的，獨立的科學審議決策諮詢的機構。</p>
<p>科學家是專指實地從事於科學研究的人，不包括科學出身後來改行的人在內。為行文方便計，簡稱為科學家。這是首先應當聲明的。</p>
<p>科學自由瑟科學參政</p>
<p>現代政治的一大特點是政府的權能空前擴大。古代政府可以無為而治，以不擾民而能使人民安居樂業為治國之最高目標·近代人類生括日趨複雜，活動範圍日趨廣大。政治旣是管理衆人之事，所以需要管理的方面一天一天的加多。時到如今，政府的職堂巳包羅萬象。因此，對於某些事體漸漸發生力不勝任的情勢。舉一個最顯著的例子，就是科學研究事業本身的立法執行和考核。這件大事不是普通政府機關所能勝任，而需要另覓解決的途徑·惟一合理的途徑是科學自目由或科學家自治。由科學家自己管理自己的研究事業，不受外行人强力的干擾，換句話說，『還科學於科學家，』科學家纔有自由，有自由，然後纔能充分發揮力量，順利前進。</p>
<p>自然，科學家同時也是國民。他的普通行為與其他國民同受法律命令的制裁，絲毫不能有越規的地方。僅在科學研究的專業上政府應該付予科學家以高度的自治，使他們在決定方針，選擇路綫，進行工作時能充分發揮獨立自主的精神。</p>
<p>政府有提倡科學的必要，而沒有干涉科學研究所需的知識，不幸的事就因此發生：它可以假借提倡之各而施統制之實。這是科學家所不願忍受的。但是安分守己巳有素養，他們遂不得不忍氣吞聲屈辱於强力控制下；志不得伸，悒鬱一生。在這境遇惡劣情緒低沉的狀况中，縱能勉强工作，收獲也一定不豐。在英美等比較開明的國家，自我們看來，政洽干擾科學的行動巳很微弱，而彼邦學人到現在還時常大聲疾呼，籲請政治之手離開科學。規模龐大的科學促進會且以「祇有科學家纔配管理科學家」一項懸為運動目標之一。一九四四年來昂斯（Lyons）作英國王家學會史，他說：十入世紀會中非科學家會員頗多，會務進行大受阻得。一八二零年後該會控制權漸入科學家手中，會務進展一天比一天順利。</p>
<p>為什麽政府不應當經由普通政治人員管制科學研究呢？政治家觀點不同，作風不同，又不能深切明瞭科學的現狀和應有的發展。他們管制科學容易發生下列幾個毛病。（二）忽視基本的純理研究，採取近功主義，覓取捷徑，片面提倡應用科學。這還是好的。（二）甚至根本不知某某科學之存在及其重要而整個不予理會。（三）用才不當。才有人才，有奴才。人才之中又有專才通才之分。奴才討人臺歡，易於被用，因而誤事。專才與通才各有所宜，位置不當，降低效能，不能發揮所長。（四）決策不當，預算難期達到合理的分配。最近在敬熙先生說過：『從政治的眼光或行政的方便去決定用途，他們（指行政人員）不能按我國科學的實際需要去用這款項。」早在民國十三年中國科學社對於庚款的處理曾經正式宣言，呼籲成立一個獨立的委員會，委員人選要完全脫離政治和外交的關係，也是針對這個毛病而發的。</p>
<p>政府不干擾科學研究事業並不是置之不理。相反的，政府應當積極提倡，通過高百分比的預算，把大批款項交給科學家組成的委員會自由支配，以便使科學機關和團體各個都能得到適當的經費，從事於它們應作而又能勝任的工作。倘若科學家要求學術自主，政府非但不肯廠心接受，反而懷恨在心，减少或停止經費，甚至威脅他們的安全時，他們失去兩種必要的自由，－不盧　乏的自由和免除恐懼的自由——結果是工作停頓，生活無着，生命不保。個人的犧牲不足惜，國家的前途可也就不堪設想了。</p>
<p>政治的領域甚為遼闊；政府的職堂也是經緯萬端。有些事業在設計和執行的時候需要高度的科學知識。這些知識為一般政治一家事業家所不具備，若不請科學家參與或主謀其事，縱不元全失敗，也是事倍功半。所以在開明的政治前進的政府下，必須有一一個由選舉產生的科學諸詢設計的機構。通過這個機構，政府可以獲得專家通學的賓貴意見。越是與科學關係密切的問題越需要聽取科學家的意見。進一步說，有些事體簡直可以完全信賴他們的建議，政府老老實實照樣執行。</p>
<p>所幸我國政府近年已漸知科學工作者的意見之可貴，有些問題已伸手求援。但美中不足的是往往不知道需要何種專家，國內有無適當人才，或明知而不用，一味請敎於客卿。本國有人才而不用，寗願消耗大量金錢假手於外人，因之產生暄賓奪主的危險。自家的事外人瞭如指掌，自家人反矇然而無所知。所不能說不是一件很危險的事。就說某項工作眞正有請外人帮忙的必要，若不經由飽學之士代為物色，恐怕很難得到資歷合適的人。至於地方性特大的科學，外國人初來中國，一時摸不着頭緒，乍受重託，潦草完事，豈不更加上常？以上種種都說明了成立一個備政府諮詢的機構是何等必要的一事。</p>
<p>科學事業的中樞機構</p>
<p>科學研究以及整個學術事業的推動一需要一個名副其實的全國性的決策審査建議的機構，已如上述。那麽，這個機構的組織如何？任務如何？如國是否己有類各科之適當的發展，進免不必要的重複，務求現有少數人才之精力不致虛耗。第二調查統計現有人才，使其各得其所。估計將來需要，提供培育人才的計劃，使各項事業與相關之敎育相配合。新興科學之無人担任者，則尋求適當學校或機關培養之或訓練之。第三，決定科學事業之大計，如研究方針，合作辦法，機關之增减擴充縮小或歸併等。第四，供政府之諮詢並自動向政府建議。這個籠照全國的機構隨時與各機關團體取得密切聯緊，使各地各科學者均有質獻於國家的機會。</p>
<p>現在我國己有兩個全國性的學術審議機構：一個是中央研究院評機會，一個是敎育部學術審議會。民國廿三年中央研究院總幹事丁文江先生根據院章組織許議會。他的原意是想把它形成一個全國性學術決策審議的機構。評議會雖然年年開會，評議員人選也大致尙稱人意，可惜因爲種似的敎構？如果有的話·保存原有還至從新設立？這都是値得討諭的問題。</p>
<p>這個機構不啻是一個學術事業的立法院，其中人員必須完全由各部門實地工作者互選出來。全國有成就的學者所選出的代表定能洞悉學術界的現狀趨勢和各機關團體的需要。我們深切希望政府交給他們大批款項並籲請社團私人慷慨捐助。把推進全國學術的責任交付於這一羣對於學術最關心的人，他們有權又有綫，定能舉靈周密，主持公道，樹立權威，督促科學事業邁步前進，追踪歐美。</p>
<p>這個機構的主要任務：第一，公正支配款項，分別經重綏急，使各方面都得到眞正必須的經費，使有工作能力的機關和有天才的學者都能發揮所長。同時對於工作不力或才不勝任者，或减少其經費，或縮小其範圍，使金錢不致浪費。在分配預算時注意種牽制，迄今不能善盡它應有的實任。所評　的事或祇限於院內，或有關全國而力不足以推行，遂致從託空言，毫無效果。學衛審議會是數年前敎育部一手組成的。其中委員均由部派，在人選方面不如評議會之由選舉產生者較為愼重。在業務方面審議會也嫌範圍太狹，縱有健全的人選，也難組負全國學衛之推進工作。</p>
<p>吾國旣需要一個決策機關，而現在又有兩個名不副實的組織，那麽，如何解決？可能的辦法有三。（一）現有兩會旣不能完成使命祇好另設機構。現在兩會或取消或專管各該院部自身的事體。（二）現有兩會並存，雙方協議，分工合作。（三）現有組織存一廢一，以其中之一統籌全國學術大計。在現狀下我們以為三者之中以第三種較為可行，並且主張以中央研究院評議會担負道個重大任務。第一，因為照章評議會之職責本該如此。第二，評議員人選較為愼重。第三，研究院本身是屆內最高而又包括學科最多的一個機關，由它來召集會議，以它的總辦事處作為通訊集會的地方，均很適當。</p>
<p>我們如果採用評議會，顯然不能以它的現狀為滿足，必須切實予以改進：充實人選，擴大職權，加强與各學術機關之聯案。最重要的是政府必須予以自由支配大宗學術研究專款之極，使它有權有能，善盡其責。評議會職權擴大，原有有評議員約三十人，實嫌人數太少，應酌予增加。選舉方法也應當重新釐定。現有評議員不盡是實地工作的學者不能算做已入正規。倘若使全國最大多數有成就的學者都能參加選舉，定能選出眞正關心學術前途的評議員，組成一個健全充實公正活躍的評議會。這是我們所迫切希望的。</p>
<p>烽火漫天，烟雲蔽日。一幅天朗氣淸春光明媚的晝圖距離現實十萬入千里。然人不可以沒有希望，沒有希望等於沒有生命。我們希望三十六歲的中華民國以筋斗雲的速度快快走完這十萬八千里。</p>
<h3>自負與自知</h3>
<p>— 古生物學專家　楊鐘健</p>
<p>自負的宿願之完成，不能靠運汛，更不能靠鈎心鬥角的鬥爭，或其他任何不正當的方式；而要靠自知，靠自己眞實的能力。多一分能力，即多一分事功。這正像一架機器，馬力是勉强不來的。</p>
<p>就個人講，自負是一種美德。所有生物，包括我們人類在內，每一種生物，好像創造者都是注重整個種的滋生繁榮的而不大注重每個個體。試看侮種生物的傳種方式，都是惟恐種不能生存，用盡方法，大量的增加。倘無損書，任其自然發展，都可在最短期內，全世界為那一種生物所佔有。然道是不可能的。每種生物的個體，不知被不適於自然環境，如仇敵災害等，摧毀了多少。自然界造物，只求種的生存，絕不計個體的安全。只要在極多數的全體中，能有少數達到傳種的目的，就算滿足了。然就每個個體講，都想用盡種種方法，使自己生存。若是高等生活物，像我們人類，那就不但要生存，還要很舒服的生存。不但要很舒服的生存，還要於生存之外，求得其他方面的滿足。如祟高的地位，優越權力等等。因此，有些個體，不能不有自負的　度。自負的出發點，可以說是立志。立一個目標，向這目標邁進。奮鬥競爭，吃苦耐勞，無非為要達到所立的志。『舜何人也，余何人也，有為者亦若是。』這是立志，也就是自負·就是每個個體，要有自命不凡的抱員。這一個個體，如可成功，發達的結果，對於同種其他個體，常然有衝突的地方。所謂「一將成名萬骨枯」就是這個道理。然佈景不整個的種來講，台灣有少數個體，能發揚光大，也就達到了全體發揚光大的目的。譬如各國人得諾貝爾獎金的人，以白種人爲多，當然人對白稱人，別眼看待，而對其他有色人種則少不了有瞧不起之感。所以我余自負爲一種美德，雖然要犧牲其他個體，而與整個積或團體的發揚光大，並不衝突。</p>
<p>我現在要把這人類的自負感，再行伸詳說一下，天凡只要一個人體格健全，生理正常，莫有不想上進的，沒有沒有慾望的，也就是沒有不自負的，而且慾望一往往茫無止境，總想百尺竿頭，一更進一步。先是同饑寒生存打交涉，等到生活問題解決了，又想一名位。等到所要想的名位到手了一，又要更高的名位。但這是很危險的事情。因為你要上進，他也要上進，你要名位，他也要名位。事業有限，名位有限，其結果當然人與人之問，免不了利書衝突，免不了自私自利，免不了攻擊或破壞他人。於是許多人類的壞毛病，也就因而產生。所以自負雖說是一種美德，而演化之極，就把人類世界，弄成有您無我，互想殘害，爾詐我虞的世界。</p>
<p>若就人以外的生物講，自殺自殘的現象，到是無所謂。許多生物，到食料不充足時，自巳吃自己同種，甚或母吃其子的事很多，然他們究竟是生物，不是人。人之所以為人，自然有他的與其他生物不同的特性。在一定疇範內要自己鬥爭，也要國到別人的鬥爭，所以才有互讓互助等美德，非本文所要詳敍的。</p>
<p>還有一個重要的事實，使人的自負，不能無限制的發展。人與人的秉性不同，環境不同，所受敎育不同，做事的才力也不同，自然其應該得的成就，也不能相同。那就是崇高的位置很多，也不是人人可以做得通，辦得順的。若果不國一切，光是憑自負甚或特別關係，得到較好而超過於自己的能力的地位，那其結果，就個人言，必然失敗，就團體言，此等情形愈多，團體事業榮也自然不會成功，而完全倒台。</p>
<p>基於以上理由，我特提出第二個問題，就是自知，自知就是要了解自己。世界上的好事情雖多，然以一個短促的生命，勢不能，一一都去作。世界上的高位置雖多，然要看看自己的能力，是否自己作得了，不至於自悮悮人。自知的條件，當首要有自信。自己相信自己能做得了什麽，做不了什麼，如是自己做不了的，也要本自負的態度，非做不可，那末當然不會成功，也當然悮了人家的事，於人於己，兩無好處，其結果就是自苦。</p>
<p>我為什麽要在此說這自負與目知的道理。我是覺得我國現在目負的人太多，自知的人太少。國事的蜩螗，這是原因中的一個，也可以說是一個主要的原因。</p>
<p>差不多人人都承認我國人幹事的能力太差。以同樣的人力，幹同樣的事情，我們總是不如外人。在外國國機關，表面看去，人用的很少，而事情推動的很靈活。即就號房來講吧，他們很大的機關，也只有一人當値，然一切事都辦了。我們許多機關，一個號房，就是三四個人，而還是周轉不靈。這自然也有別的原因，而我們的人的能力，很不如人，實無司講言。細約自然歷史博物館古生物部門只有一個女的，她管理實騐室中的圖書室，管理標本登記，管理全實騐室文章的修正與校對，而且還每星期到總圖書館為大家選各人應看的新參老書。這些事如在中國，至少要用五個人，而不見得比她一人辦得更好。</p>
<p>由位置較高的家務說，我們每一個機關，與人家相守機關的人一比，就知道我們的人的質素，實在不如人家。換一句話說，就是我們很自負得到的地位，然而未能充分的自知。我想我們現在全國上下，任何職業的任何人，能勝任愉快，人稱其事的，雖然不能說沒有，然實只佔可憐的少數。從一個機關的打字員起，到首長自己，莫不有此現象。然而我們還只聽見許多人對自己地位，不滿足，不甘心，仍舊要往上爬。其結果爬的高，跌的重。個人跌塲了，到無所謂，至多犧牲了個人，但一個國家中，假使多數衙門，或個個結構，都是不稱職的人充任，那國家還會有希望吧？</p>
<p>我想至少有些因人為太自負，不免成了盲目，也自以為很自知不免有了「我公不出如蒼生何！』或『舍我其誰』的感覺，大家都想往上爬，也不計其自己的能力。其流弊所及，際造成傾軋爭奪等現象外，人事的變動，也成了常事。很少看到一個人，能在一個固定職務上，有較長歷史的人。因大家崇尙能爬的人，對於此等今天升一官，明天又換一官的人，不但不痛惡，反而茨慕。自己如有機會，也可來一下。這樣一來。事情愈不易　，只見升官圖式的宦海浮沉，而不見與實事業的進展。</p>
<p>譬如有一個人，無論他天分有多麽高，能力有多麽大，但是今天辭了某某主席，明天又可以為某某部長。或是今天在軍事上為燈購人物，明天又要和專門人才爭徽碗，研究水利。我敢相信他一件事也辦不好。在中國，官一坐大，好像就成了萬能人，什麽都會。這些人根本無知，何能責之以自知！又臂如才開的國民大會中的代表，道些都是代表人民、要為國家議大法，謀福利的人們，當然有不少是我們佩服的。但恐他們也有不少人如一自問自巳所代表者為何人，自己的修義，知識，政洽道德，能否與先進國家的人民代表或從事政治的人物一比而無愧色，恐怕他們捫心目問，也有些難以為情吧！進而雷之，各黨各派，爭政權，為民主，要把國家弄好，這無論就個人曾，就政黨言，都是一種自負，何嘗可以非議，但這些人也當自己把自己考騐一下，自己的德行與能力如何。如無自知的雅量，而冒昧上台，縱可取快一時，其如最後還是身敗名裂何？其如因此演成誰上了誰也不滿意誰，造成走馬燈式的革命何？</p>
<p>從另一方面言之，我只能一說我自己的經騐。古生物學在科學中不過是一門自然科學，而我年來從事的，僅是其中的脊推動物部門。然已感浩如烟海，自己能力，不能全副貫通。當我四十歲時，適在雲南發見若干化石，我窮力所及，竟不能辨別其為哺乳動物，還派是爬行動物，所以我四十自薜對聯中，曾有「記骨廿載，爬哺莫辨』一句，用以自責。在一般人看了，您埋頭廿年，從事於骨化石的研究，尙辨不出什麼是爬行，什麽哺乳，您當然是飯桶。然我也只有承認自責，只有覺得自己能力差。但因此我也懷疑到別人的工作，入類的智慧，相差不會多的，尤其政治科學和政治活動，也不會比自然科學，容易多少的。（早然像美國友人曾吿訴我，美國人東不成，西不就，什麽攪不成，然後攪政治。這只可作為一種諷刺。）然而有些和我年資差不多的人，現在都變成顯要了。我很懷疑他們，就是努力幹，也不見得不像我爬哺莫辨的，把什麽主義，當成什麽主義了吧，何况有些根本自己尙未充實，從何談得到大展經綸，應付建國的大業呢！</p>
<p>中國現在，死於五强之一，十分勉强，已為大家所公認。然一究其原因何在，在我看來，十分簡單。我們人人所擔任的事情，都是勉强的，都是自憶所不能勝任，而勉强充任的職務，，所以才造成如此的現象，而為勉强的五强之一！</p>
<p>現在大多數國內知名之士，其肈名地位，早巴超出於他的能力之外。這因為中國事事落後，人才稀少，稍一表樹，名利雙來。就個人講，可以說是得天獨厚。誠如于右任先生有詩云「身非嗚世承新運』。這所謂新運，可作我國人才太少解釋。這些人憑該兢兢業業從事他的木位工作，知所得地位，不是靠自己本事，乃是靠中國國情而來，一方面努力充實自己，務使能力與地位兩想付合，當之無愧，然後國家也會漸漸上軌道，也會有希望。倘若仍不知足，不但對不起國家，也對不起自己，損人不利己，這些人我勸他們要自知。至於一般靑年人，及地位不重要的人，却仍布望他們能自負，但自負不是一句空話，這自負的宿願之元成，不能靠運氣，更不能靠鈎心鬥角的門爭，或其他不正當的方式，而要靠自知，靠自己真實的能力。多一分能力，即多一分事功·學問如此，做事也當如此。這正像一架機器，馬力是勉強不來的。馬力不足，還是不能人生的奮鬥途徑上，安全旅行。　　自質與自知，並不矛盾。然要雙方兼顧，國家北會事情，一才有希望，能人盡其才，人安其位，而工作的效事，也就自然推進了·（廿五·十二，九，南京·）</p>

<h3>新年代新任務　聯合勤務總司令</h3>
<p>— 黃鎮球</p>
<p>民國三十六年度新年代的到來，是說明這一階段的歷史使命，已更緊迫的降臨於全國軍民的肩上。</p>
<p>第一，中國國民黨還政於民的宏願，已於去歲國民大會之完滿閉幕而達成，政府為了要制定一部民主的憲法以最大的容忍態度和各黨各派，社會暨達開誠佈公，共同研制，則這部憲法，無疑的蓋於國內大多數人民的意旨，所以除了不數人另有作用外，應博得大多數人民的擁戴。民主政治就是制憲與行憲，制憲固極重要，行憲尤為重要，如其不能行憲，或行之而不得其法，雖有完美的憲法，也變了水月鏡花，成了一頁空頭支票，或粉飾門面的點綴品而已。因此行憲乃是全國人民今年最大的任務，而憲法之能不能行之有道，在本年一年之內，我們必須要看到端倪，看到有成。諺云：「行百里者半九十」。西諺亦云：「要有好的開端」。如此說來，民國三十六年誠是我國能不能實行民主的一個測騐，換方之，也就是我們能否順應世界潮流，齊登強國之林的一個測騐。</p>
<p>第二，行憲的基礎，在於國內的統一與安定，而國內的統一與安定則又緊於軍隊屬於國家這一前提，大多數人的主張是建築於大多數人的利益之上的，大多數人的主張，制成法令，少數人雖然不贊成也應服從，少數人未當不可以政治方式從事鬥爭，但增對不允許於國家軍隊之外，另組織某一集團的軍隊，以槍砲和人民的血肉做政爭的工具，如果不幸而有這種迷信武力的人，那就是遠憲。為了爭取行憲的基礎，我們就必須爭取軍隊國家化。軍隊國家化的理論，已經講得很久了，但是迄今除了國家軍隊之外，依然另有非法武力的存在，分裂國土，屠殺人民，試問在這種情況之下，憲法可行嗎？民主政治能走上軌道嗎？此新年代既是行憲之年，那麼軍隊國家化的難題，今年必須獲得解決，希望迷信武力奪取政權的人，能以人民之心為心，祖國之福為福，翩然改　，還政於民還軍於國。</p>
<p>第三，這次世界大戰，民主國家只贏得戰爭，尚未贏得和平。侵略掠奪的思想仍殘留在野心國家的腦子裏，不特未曾根絕，而且還有枯木逢春之處，空前未有的大規　神經戰爭在進行着，無人能夠保證目前現有星星的野火，不致燎原，處此局勢之下，為保證我們國家民族的生存，國防建設不能不急起直追，我國新國防的組織與計劃，在主席，白部長，陳總長領導之下，已於去歲建立起來，然事態迫切，新國防建設的實施不容許遲緩，全國軍民應於新年代肇始之時，授受主席的指示，同心戳力以赴。我們說到國防，則作為國防之母的工業，誠不可忽視，抗戰勝利後，復員經年，我國工業景象，當之痛心，東北工業設備被有計劃的劫掠，特殊區域工業大部被人破壞，接收工業多數停頓。工業若此，國防腐從何談起？因此我們知道，我政府與人民，對工業的整理與建設，及其間各種阻力之突破，這一努力必須和新年度之開始同時到來，然後國家民族的生存，才有保證。</p>
<p>我們從「政治民主化」「軍隊國家化」「工業國防化」三點着眼，三十六年度實為戰後情況最緊急之一年，亦是我們任務最嚴重最艱苦的一年，全國軍民必須有此認識與努力！</p>
<h3>國內十大要聞　（上接第一版）</h3>
<p>（五）收復張家口</p>
<p>張家口之戰，是由大同之戰所引起的。中共軍自七月中旬起團攻大同，城裏的國軍拼死苦守，中共軍打了兩個月還是沒有打下來。這時，東面熱河河北及西面綏遠一帶的國軍，為了應援大同方面的戰爭，解救危城，自九月一日起分路發動攻勢，向張家口推進，以牽引包團大同的中共兵力。</p>
<p>張家口是戰事結束以後中共實際政治軍事的中心。在抗戰期中，大家都知道中共的首腦部是在延安，但戰事結束以後，中共便已逐漸把它部分的機構和人員移向張家口。張家口自古為北方的軍事要隘，進可以攻，退可以守，在地理上照應着東北及華北的整個局面，不像延安那樣地僻處一角；尤其是物產之豐僥，更非地瘠民貧的延安所能望其項背。中共對於自己這一個新神經中樞，當然是要死守的。</p>
<p>這一塲張家口爭奪戰，從九月初起持續了一個半月，到十月十一日，國軍收復了張家口。</p>
<p>這在軍事上，對中共當然是一個極大的打擊。同時這也使中共發覺了以武力爭奪政權之不可靠。如果中共不進攻大同，國軍亦不致需要進攻張家口；如果大家都能忠實遵行政協決議，不以武力解決問題，那末這種血亦就可以不必白流。正如牽部攻入張垣的傳作義將軍所說的：「雖然打了勝仗，但只有沉痛，而無快意」，因為在政府，是絕不願見自己所治理着的國家如此兵　滿地的。</p>
<p>（六）國民大會</p>
<p>當十大新聞選舉之時，國大尚在進行期中。現在，大會已圓滿閉幕，中華民族有史以來的第一部憲法！亦已經制定了。這當然將成為去年度的第一件大事，也可以說是辛亥革命以來的第一件大事。</p>
<p>國民大會於十一月十五日在南京舉行開幕典禮，由吳敬恒主席。國府蔣主席亦出席致詞，勉各代表完成神聖任務。十八日起，舉行預備會，選出主席團主席四十六人，並起草了大會的議事規程。廿五日起舉行正式大會，討論議事規則。廿八日，第三次大會舉行時，蔣主席代表政府，將憲草鄭重遺交三次大會主席胡適。以後，各代表即在大會中對憲草各方面廣泛陳述意見，並組織了各個分組審查會，綜　　理各代表的意見，分別再予討論。同時，並由綜合審查會來作總的整理和研討。其中如第一條約國體正名問題，立法院與行政院的關係問題，國大的權限問題，官更有否兼任代表的問題等等，都曾引起　熾烈的辟論。終因蔣主席寬宏的感召，以及代表間的皆能和衷共濟，忍讓為國，所以各條都能在極民主進步的原則下取得協議。十二月二十日，憲法一讀竣事。廿一日至廿四日，二讀竣事。廿五日，三讀通過，由第二十次大會主席於右任提付表決，全塲一致起立鼓掌通過，歡聲協動，並高呼「中華民國萬歲」。廿五日下午，舉行閉幕式，由主席吳敬恒將通過後之憲草鄭重　送國民政府蔣主席。大會歷時四十日，此莊嚴神聖的制憲工作乃告完成。大會中決定於三十六年十二月廿五日行憲。</p>
<p>（七）開放外匯</p>
<p>二月廿五日，國防最高委員會通過了開放外匯市塲案，將官價外匯匯率予以廢止。同時，閉幕式通過了進出口貿易暫行辦法，和中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法。</p>
<p>這原是戰事結束，進出口貿易恢復有望以後所必須有的措施。過去的舊匯率二十對一，早已經是名存實亡了，誰都知道二十塊法幣換不到一元美金，不過因為戰時對外的交通根本已全部斷絕，除了軍用作戰物資的輸入以外，商品根本無國際買賣可言，所以也沒有什麼急需調整的必要。等到戰事勝利結束，這問題就立刻引起了政府和民間金融工商界的密切注意。為了匯率的應如何決定，國內許多專家們都曾紛紛為文討論。這件事情，關係極為重大，因為如果訂得太高了，這在工商界當然很贊成，因為如此則貨品所換得的美金可以值錢，出口數量因之必會增加，而外貨則因運來後在中國賣了換不到多少美金，這算盤劃不來，所以進口貨必將減少，間接使本國的工商業可以欣欣向榮。但在一般小百姓們呢，則八年來已經被暴發戶和囤積居奇者所操縱下的物價壓得透不過氣來了，極希望外匯能訂得低，美國貨大量地來，好把物價壓低一些。這兩方面的不同立塲都不能不顯到的。</p>
<p>政府權衡兩者的得失利害，審慎將事，最後，在二月二十五日決定了廢止官價匯率，並由中央銀行正式掛牌，規定外匯率為二〇二〇。</p>
<p>外匯市塲的開放亦就是進出口貿易的開放。這在戰後的國家經濟上，當然是一件極重要的事情。</p>
<p>（八）李公樸聞一多被刺</p>
<p>民主同盟中委李公樸，於七月十一日晚間在昆明遇刺身死，當塲獲一嫌嫌疑犯李成業，惟李堅不承認，搜其身間，又無武器。十五日下午五時半，昆明西南聯大敎授聞一多，復於參加李公樸追悼會後在街頭被暴徒狙擊，不救殞命。兩案相距各種猜疑。蔣主席聞訊，極為關懷，手令鎮省軍政當局期緝　正兇，同時下院亦通信各省市政府　宣負　，保護一切人民之生命安全與自由，並派警察總署長赴昆督飭查緝。其後主席更派顧祝同前往昆明全　處　李聞兩案。經顧氏抵昆詳加研查後，緝獲聞案正凶，得悉凶犯湯時亮李文山係現役軍人，十五日於李公機追悼會中聽聞一多演說，詆毀軍人，散會後一時氣憤，將聞用手槍擊死。案情至此乃告大白。兩犯經軍事法庭判處死刑，於八月廿六日執行槍決。至於李案，則迄今仍在嚴密緝兇中。</p>
<p>（九）進出口許可制度</p>
<p>自戰事結束以後，我國復員最急切的工作，即是在獲取物資，以補充抗戰八年來的消耗與匱乏。所以在戰事結束後的一年間，大量的進口物資源源運入，聯總的救濟物資亦絡繹輸入，在這種情形下，政府所掌握的物資，已有相當數量。政府為了配合國家既定的經濟政策，扶植國內的工商事業，所以在十七日公佈了修正進出口貿易暫行辦法十八項，履行進出口貨的許可制度。</p>
<p>在這個新辦法之下，一切貨品的出口，除禁止出口的特種礦產，米麥等九大類外，其餘都可以自由出口。至於貨品的　入，則除禁止進口的四十大類外，其餘都應該事先請領輸入許可證。</p>
<p>換句話說，就是相當地鼓勵出口，而管制進口。為了實施這一個制度，並聯繫與進出口有關的各機構的工作，政府在最高經濟委員會之下，設立了一個輸入臨時管理委員會，統　進行。</p>
<p>當然，進口許可制度的實施，並未能完全達到鼓勵國內生產及謀取進出口平衡的目的，因為這方面的因素很多，非一件事所能解決。但無論如何，進口許可制度確實已刺激了出口貿易的開展，並相當地遏制了一些過份猖獗的美鈔黑市。</p>
<p>（十）陳公博案</p>
<p>叛國者死！何況是頭號漢奸——偽「國民政府」的代理「主席」呢？</p>
<p>暮春三月，江南草長，蘇州的高院中，正嚴肅地對這位想逃往「友邦」去而又被抓回的巨奸清算。</p>
<p>「陳公博能謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處死刑，被奪公權終身。全部財產，除酌留家屬必須生活費外，沒收。」</p>
<p>滔滔萬方的自白書是不能掩其罪惡於萬一的。劣　昭彰，請看法庭公佈的陳逆十大罪狀：</p>
<p>（一）締結密約辱國喪權</p>
<p>（二）搜索物資供給敵人</p>
<p>（三）發行偽幣擾亂金融</p>
<p>（四）認賊作父宣言參戰</p>
<p>（五）抽集壯丁為敵服役</p>
<p>（六）公賣鴉片毒化人民</p>
<p>（七）改編敎材實施奴化敎育</p>
<p>（八）託詞清鄉殘害志士</p>
<p>（九）官吏貪污政以賄成</p>
<p>（十）收編偽軍禍國殃民</p>
<p>判決書由江蘇高院送呈最高法院覆判，五月十四日，最高法院宣布：「原判決核准」。六月三日，清晨——陳公博的末日至矣。</p>
<p>晨七時卅分，蘇高檢處派檢察官李躅東，偕書記官法警等，赴第三監獄，在禮字第一號囚室內押出陳逆，作最後一次鞠訊。八時卅分，在監獄後的荒榮圃刑塲中行刑。槍聲起處，此一代巨奸，終乃自食其果！</p>
<p>保護花蓮市的堤防護岸，已被颱風吹毀一部，亟待與工搶修，否則市區易成澤國。</p>

<h3>文化運動之回顧與展望</h3>
<p>— 文化運動委員會主委　張道藩</p>
<p>人爲萬物之靈，人類獨特之　，所以異於一般動物者，就因他有創造的意志與力量，本着這種力量去自動互發，自動開拓，以遂到他所欲得的價值，選定而厚積其價值，以形成文化系統，所以文化是人類心能開積的成就，也即是人類創造的意志力量，所產生之價值與共業，人之所以爲萬物之靈，即在於此。</p>
<p>如果人類而無創造的意志與力量，則與一般動物相同，動物亦能創造，但不能開積，亦能慕仿，但不能選定，所以動物只能適應生存而不能開積適應生存的價值共業，譬如河沙，雖經過千百年的堆積，從一年二年乃至百千萬年，其情形可想而知，人類不然，其自由意志的發動與創造，日有開積，日有動向，無所限制，也無所束縛，因其有不斷的互動與創造，才選定了無限的價值與共業，然後能與自然界宣吿獨立，開拓出文化的領城，文化領域的範　無窮，文化運動即從事於開拓的動向。</p>
<p>文化領域無窮，憑人類的創造開積而決其範疇，生物求生存的目的相同，人類也爲着生存而開積創造，以選定適合生存的價值爲「厚生」而「利用」，離不開物質與精神，物質精神，是唯生一元的兩面，爲了「利用」必須創造物質的文化，如衣食住行與及其他工具的進步，和整個環境的調適，無非是助長有益於生存的條件，而拋除有礙於生存的障礙「利用」所以「厚生」而「厚生」的要求，尙不如此之簡單，人類於物質利用之外，還要求安慰，愉快，秩序，拓大，自由等等，爲此種種慾望的滿足，不能不有精神文化的創造，而政治，語言，倫理，文學，藝術，宗敎，從而產生「利用」「厚生」的總合，便是民族文化的總量，文化運動的工作，即居於小我與大我之間，在生存競爭的條件之下，因當前的需要，而決定其動向與範疇，以創造選擇世界人類所應得的地位，這即是永久和平。</p>
<p>文化與文化運動，旣如上述，更有進一步的補充解釋，「文化」和「文化運動」又有很不相同的性質，文化是果，文化運動是因，文化是已形成了的，文化運動是正在進展中的，因此我們可以說，文化運動是一種創造文化的活動，而文化則爲創造的結晶，舉例來說，科學發明是文化運動，發明的結果以創造機器是文化，民權思想是文化運動，運動的產生以創制憲法，是文化人類創造的意志力量永無已時，文化運動的前途也永無已時，文化領域無窮，文化運動的範疇也無窮，我們只能就生存的需要，爲其動向，而以創造成熟活力變爲結晶，爲一期文化運動的暫時段落。</p>
<p>基於上述，我們在三民主義最高涵義之下，從事於文化運動工作者，我們不妨檢討過去，在文化領域中，有無相當開拓成果，以來配合當前生存的需要，而決定今後的新動向。</p>
<p>談文化運動的檢討與動向，便離不了歷史的背景與時代的需要，更須認識主體的歷史使命，從辛亥的種族政治革命，一改幾千年歷史舊觀，反映於文化的特徴，是五四新文化運動的孕育與產生，發出近代中國文化史上劃時代的信號，兩次北伐繼承了辛亥事業，完成劃時期轉捩，對於文化影響，雖是解除了封建的桎梏，而中西激盪，驚古崇新者，各走極端，形成了綜錯散漫的現象，到抗戰暴發，中華民族瀕於生死關頭，於是文化運動才配合了抗建事業，同時進行，爲生存而創造，除陰柔的文化，變成了陽剛，綜錯的情形，變成了統一一，極端的趨勢，變成了中庸，以及文化界的醒覺，文化領域的擴充，一言蔽之，是文化內容的提高與充實，我們可以從文化內容的分析，來檢討八年來文化運動的方針與成果。</p>
<p>在學術理論方面，自從五四新文化運動以後，雖然結束了封建的桎梏，但未免有「火炎崑岡，玉石俱焚」之感，一時新的不曾成熟，舊的一概推翻，外來文化，形成喧賓奪主之勢爭辯論戰，每多頑固偏執，到抗戰期間，爲了理論與行動的配合，文化事業，便替了抗建事業，一方面要發揚固有的優良傳統，鞏固人心，一方面要趕上現代的科學文明，適應需要，於是在學術思想上的中外文化，獲得了新的認識，新的估儼，不惟使固有文化的價值，在國內與科學文明等量齊觀，而且在國際文化中佔據了相當的地位。</p>
<p>在思想意志方面，從辛亥革命以後，以致於北伐的完成，雖然是確定了國民信仰的中心，但因學術理論的分歧，散播着綜錯複雜的思想，直至現實問題的到臨，才恍然於匹夫有責的任務，反映於文化方面的特徵，是思想意志的集中統一，一反往日陰柔純靜的作風，走向現實擴大的道路，一切配合抗戰，配合建國，文化運動即是抗戰建國運動，開闢了空前所無的表現技術，更確認三民主義的文化涵義，爲復興中國的最高原則。</p>
<p>在生活行動方面，文化本來是生活的表徵，人類爲生活，而後有文化的開積，從一般生活，可以看到文化的片斷，中國自海通以後，無時不羨慕外國的物質文明，而發生慷憬厭惡的矛盾思想，但自抗戰以後，從矛盾歸到統一，人們放棄了奢侈，甘心於恬淡，反映於文化方面，是生活的改善與精神動員，加强了從小我到大我的固有民族道德，養成了由家族到民族的嶄新倫理觀念，文化運動適用於抗建事業，形成中國新文化的昇華。</p>
<p>檢討八年來文化運動動的向，可以說爲全民族生存問題而創造，而選定，而開積，整個的文化運動，配合了抗建事業而工作，文化領域是擴張了，文化內容是充實了空虛的現象轉變到現實，紛歧的情形轉變到集中，矛盾的心理轉變到統一，這不能不算是檢討中文化運動的堅實成功，也算是一期文化運動的堦段，但今後文化運動的使命更大了，以前配合抗戰，今後要配合建國，文化運動的新動向，是要在文化領域中，爲建國前途而創造開積，我們嚴格反省當前文化界的情形，也不無令我們猛省之處，第一是文化領域中科學的成就還不及一般藝術，第二是文化的內容上，物質的進步也難與精神齊驅，第三，文化界的本身，也不能齊一步調，因此形成文化事業上的等差，今後要配合建國事業，我們應當確定如下的新動向：</p>
<p>（一）三民主義是建國的最高原則，文化運動必須在三民主義的原則下而確定其方針與動向，建國的文化運動，必然是三民主義的文化運動。</p>
<p>（二）基於民義的最高涵義，文化運動應當發揚固有優秀的文化，溝通國際文化，以消弭誤會，增進了解，以臻於人類的永久和平爲目的。</p>
<p>（三）基於民權主義的最高　義，文化運動是要開拓民主精神，充實敎育本質，以管敎養　爲實踐，以自由平等爲目的。</p>
<p>（四）基於民生主義的最高涵義，文化運動是要消弭瑎級鬥爭，調協社會經濟，以民生富裕，民生業利爲最大目的。</p>
<p>文化建設是國家建設的基礎，文化的領城無窮，文化運動的範疇也無窮，我們檢討過去，展望將來，必需把握住主要的目標，確定了正確的動向，在生存的目的下，並兼着理想與事實於此範疇，努力開拓，一定能以文化力量，增加民族力量，以文化建設促成國家建設。</p>
<p>紅頭嶼——漁人之島（特派員江暮雲寄）</p>
<h3>氣象學之功用</h3>
<p>— 氣象學專家　呂烔</p>
<p>氣象學在今日可稱爲一門效用最爲廣泛的應用科學。歐美各大氣象臺每日接受社會上各界詢問天氣報吿者，不知凡幾。如戰前德國柏林氣象臺每日自朝至暮，派有專人元坐電話機旁，回答各界詢間天氣預測。美國氣象局將天氣報吿每日灌音製片，自朝至慕開動留聲機片，社會人士，欲知未來天氣，祗須撥動電話機，手持聽筒，置之耳旁，即可聽得天氣報告，由此可知氣象科學在歐美應用之廣。本國氣象事業，方在創始，我國人士對此項科學，或有未盡明瞭者，爰草此文，將氣象科學在各方面之應用，的略叙述，以介紹於讀者。</p>
<p>氣象學之功能最初應用於農業，蓋農產之豐歉，與雨量溫度，息息相關。而尤以雨量的豐嗇。更爲重要。各地氣候，何者宜於何稱植物，均須先有氣象測量，以爲栽培作物之參考。反之，農地墾植。如無氣象測量，則根本不知何種植物，宜於栽植。大規模之果園中秋冬殺籍之預測，非常重要，因在事先如無準備，圖中果實，一旦遭受　　，損失非淺，蔗糖之區，決不能過　害，事先如有所知，以爲準備如置爐薰烟，，以除　　，即可避免損失。</p>
<p>沿海漁業之區，天氣預測，亦極重要。漁民駕舟海上，有遇風　，不及趨避，常遭滅頂之患。我國沿海一帶，無知漁民，向不知利用天氣報吿，故每年葬身魚腹者，不知多少。近來農林部對此非常注意，因商請中央氣象局籌設沿海海洋氣象臺，每日預吿天氣，利用無綫電廣播。如遇惡劣天氣，得以預爲趨避，藉以保護漁民安全，庶免蹈旣往之覆轍。如此計劃實行，則將來沿海漁民，受益當非淺鮮。</p>
<p>水利工程亦不能脫離氣象工作，如近來美國水利工程專家薩凡奇博士爲我國計劃的揚子江水閘工程及黃河儲水工程，除其他科學工作外，氣象之測說，亦頗重要。苟無氣象測資料，則設計難於進行。最近　凡博士由京出發沿途視察黃河治水工程，事前曾商請中央氣象局供給黃河流域一帶氣象資料，並爲文研究黃河流域之氣象情形，以供參考。防水防早爲水利專家及氣象學家共同的任務，事前如無長期的氣象測騐，則預防水早的計劃，即無從實現。此種氣象測騐，年代愈久愈好，歐美氣象紀錄，大都在數十年以上，且有達百年左右者，故預防水旱，較有辦法。</p>
<p>航空與氣象的關係，更見密切，盡人皆知。飛機飛航天空，如天氣良好，自極安全，有中途突遇風暴，則危險堪虞。因天氣惡劣而致飛機失事，事例極多，不勝枚舉。最近的例子，如十二月十四日因北方寒潮南下，風在雨驟，致中央航空公司運輸機一架，墜毀於浙江長興附近。中國航空公司六十七號客機，於是日下午五時二十分自京飛抵上海，降落龍華機塲，因風勢過猛，致與塲內其他停留之飛機相撞，此猶係不幸中之大幸者。風與雲霧，爲航空氣象學中最爲重要之氣象要素，故高空中各高度風向風力以及雲霧之測量，在航空上應最先注意。</p>
<p>衛生行政亦須氣象資料以供研究，尤以每年夏季爲甚。因瘧疾，傷寒，霍亂，痢疾等疫病，多於夏季發生，且與溫度之高低及濕度之大小有密切之關係，故衛生署防疫機構，每年夏季，必須向氣象機構索取我國各地大城市氣象資料，以爲研究之準則，而作防禦之措施。</p>
<p>近數年來糧食部對於各地收穫豐歉之評判，常取材於氣象資料，以作參考，而定徵糧徴實之多寡。如一地雨量過多或過少，造成旱澇，則徴糧自可酌予减少。否則地方報荒，而檢查雨量適宜，則知地方不免有報吿失實之處了。</p>
<p>歐美應用氣象，幾至家喩戶為，舟車行旅，亦必預先探詢天氣情形。建築房屋，必先探知兩量張度，以爲修溶溝渠大小之理一羈。美國好萊塢電影公司出外擾取電影，竟與氣象學家訂有合同，負責報吿天氣。因電影明星，用途闊綽，外出攝影，如不幸而遇陰雨連綿，遷延時日，費用浩繁，公司之損失，不在少數、</p>
<p>二次世界大戰，歐美利用氣象，出奇制勝，亦有不少事蹟，可以稱道，足資借鏡。略述數端，或亦爲讀者所樂聞。</p>
<p>當一九三九年九月德軍攻波蘭時，由氣象學家擇吉發動。我們知道在歐洲秋冬是多雨的時候。德國氣象學家替他們的空軍測得一連數天不下雨的時期，於是德國空軍用排山倒海之勢，川流不息的轟炸，日夜襲擊，華沙從此垮臺。其後攻挪威，襲希臘，征克里特島（Crete），皆如法泡製，正所謂不旋踵而攻城略地，利用天氣預測極盡閃擊之能事。又如一九四一年二月德人亦因利用天氣預測，戰艦兩艘得以逃出虎口。原來德國有兩條戰艦，一條呌做香霍斯脫號（Scharnboster），另一條呌格那綏腦號（Gneisenau），停在法國海岸勃雷斯脫（Brest）地方。艦長要想把這二條戰艦經英倫海峽，駛回波羅的海，但是英國的轟炸機虎視躭躭，談何容易。納粹海軍領袖雷特爾上將（Admiral　Racder）乃商之氣象學家，其條件爲；須有低雲掩護，雲下能見度十分惡劣，在離海上幾百公尺的低空中，看不淸海面上艦隻的活動，敵機（指英國）飛入雲中，翼上即凝結成冰，如此戰艦始能脫離英國空軍之火網。德國氣象學家查得此種天氣在二月中當一風暴自西向東過峽時即可產生。是年二月九日德國氣象學家報吿，謂時期已至，整備出動。德艦二艘，乃於二月十一日夜間開離勃雷斯脫，而於决日駛過英倫海峽，英國空軍的魚雷炸彈竟無所施其技。</p>
<p>一九四四年六月六日盟軍攻德，在諾曼第登陸時，亦由氣象學家擇吉開仗。盟軍選擇六月登陸，是有氣候的根據的。因爲在法國沿海岸諾曼第一帶，六月裏的雨天（Rainy　days）在全年各月中爲最少。但在登陸前幾天，天天下雨。攻歐統帥艾森豪威爾（Eisenhower）很是焦慮，每天就商於氣象學家。及六月四日，氣象學家吿以在三十六小時內天氣可以好轉。於是艾帥遂決定六月六日夜間登陸。不過這次登陸，除了氣象學的因素而外，尙有海洋學的因素。因爲六月六日恰巧是滿月（Full　moon）的時候，高潮低潮都特別來得利害，當夜裏潮退的時候，沙洲一片，廣大無垠，月亮微光，隱的透過雲層，正是便利登陸的時候．</p>
<p>通常各種天氣的變化，是由西而東的。英德開戰以後，英國的氣象報吿即守秘密，道於德國是不利的。因爲這樣它不再能利用英國的天氣報吿來預測其本國未來的天氣變化。然而，猶可利用格陵蘭的天氣報吿，勉强推測。所以美軍在一九四四年十月初旬把德國在格陵蘭的氣象臺予以佔領，使得德國在大西洋上的天氣從此不易偵得。第二次大戰結束後，有些强國，恐怕受人侵略，在北極圈內，競設測候所站，也是一件值得注意的事。此次大戰，美國以資力雄厚，其氣象報吿，幾可謂廣被全球。訓練大學生從事測候工作，達數千人之多。單以陸軍航空隊而論，在戰時海外設立了的九百個氣象測候站，再加上了平時正規的氣象臺的報吿，因此他們差不多可以隨時隨地知道整個地球上除了兩極以外任何一處的天氣狀况。所以塞班島今日被美軍佔領，翌日即有氣象報吿發出。所以美國軍艦飛機，能在海上空中，縱橫驟馳，了無阻碍，因此氣象工作幫助他們打了勝仗。至於我國氣象事業，亦因戰爭關係，漸趨發達，惟與英美相較，猶望塵莫及，願我國人注意及之，</p>
<h3>克服現實　創造文化</h3>
<p>— 文化史專家　陳東原</p>
<p>要想文化程度增高，一般說來，必須生活安定，經濟寬裕。因爲如此，然後才有閒暇，才能產生文化創造之理智，情緒，與欣賞底能力。要依這個前提，來談到目前中國文化建設，實在是一件比較不容易的事。經過了一百年不平等條約的束縛，八年長期的抗戰，早已把一般人的生活，壓迫得喘不過氣來。而目前內亂還在繼續，交通未復、經濟破產，弄得生靈塗炭，復員無期。每一個中國國民都感覺求生不得，要死不能。在這種情形下，從那裹有力量建設文化呢？所以我們的文化，如果只聽其目然的發展，是無望其能提高的。</p>
<p>不過，從歷史上的事實看，任何國家的文化，都不是直綫上昇，也不是永遠下降的。燦爛的希臘，有衰落之日。黃金的羅爲，有滅亡之時。文化之有衰退時期，爲任何國家所不能免。而物極必反，否極則泰來，即以西洋而論，生在黑暗的中古時代的人，誰也料不到會有今日科學昌朋的世界。用陳衡會女士一句話來解釋：「醫如春天將來之時，雖然朝風夕雨，天陰地濕，而燦爛的春光，却是非此不能釀成的。」我們對於中國的現狀，何嘗不可作如此的看法？問題只是在我們從那一點發生力量，循那一種途徑，來復眞我們的文化。</p>
<p>翻開報紙雜誌，看看我們現在的文藝作品，什九都是不滿現實，攻擊現實，儘情描繪規實的醜惡，而又提不出一個理想。如果有提出來的，千篇一律，不外是政洽改革，鼓吹聯合所謂民主的戰士組織新的政府。換句話說，今日大多數作家所提出的意見，是認爲只要政府改革了，國家就可以好，文化就可以進步。這與戊戌維新，認爲只要除去慈禧，國家就可以變好，一樣的錯誤。文化，是一時代精神物質的總表現，儒要全體國民在各方面的共同努力，決不是改革了政府，就可以把整個生活改善，一般文化提高的。民主政治，是我們今日的需要，但我們尤其需要的，是全國智能之士，一德一心，分工合作，各人在其崗位上，爲國家而努力。也惟有這樣，才是眞正的民主。</p>
<p>生活的不安和經濟的困難，固然是文化進步的障碍，但黑暗中是要想露出光明必須先進的人土克服這種困難，振奮起創造的理智與情緒，給予全國國民一種向上的理想，作共同努力的方針。這一點，不是不能做到的。舉文學爲例，在第一次大戰後，德國的文學家爲拯救戰敗的日耳曼民族，旣不以現實的自身作手段，也不逃避現實，却更熱烈地一面擁抱着現實，一面依據精神的實澈力，流動性，與鮮明的憧憬，去征服現實，抑制現實。其舊小說家，是欲以其著作給予興味與娛樂，而德國的新小說家則欲以其著作給予人民以感動與向上的情緒。前者在描寫外在的現實，後者在改造現實以完成高尙現實。這就是文學上的表現主義。德國後來雖被瘋魔的希特勒引上了沒落的道路，但是他們文學家拯救民族的精神，却是不可抹殺的。由於這種史實，談到我們今日的文化建設，我們的文學家，爲何不放棄其徒然描繪現實的作風，而鼓其愛民族的愛文化的熱情給予我們以前進的向上的理想，以期轉移風氣呢？豈但文學如此，所有理事會不，政治，社會，經濟，科學，敎育，美術，音樂，戲劇等各種學術之從業人士，都應當放棄其消極煩悶屈服於現賞的態度，而提出一種向上的理想，在學術的研究與實際業務上切實努力。果能如此，中國文化建設，才有希望，新中國的誔生，也就可以於茲萌　了。</p>

<h3>勝利后一年中　工程建設</h3>
<p>— 工程專家　侯家源</p>
<p>抗戰期中，凡經敵騎所及之地，所有交通路綫，暨各項公共工程，無不遭受極嚴重之損毀，經歷戰爭愈久之地帶，其損失愈重，就鐵路一項而言，長江以北各路以撤退較速，路綫設備在戰爭結束之時，尚屬較爲究整，但經此年餘不斷之破壞，迄今大江以北，尚無一暢通之幹綫鐵道，江南諸路，久經抗戰期間拉鋸爭奪，路綫設備均屬殘破不堪，而尤以浙贛一路綫致全部破壞，各路之機車車輛，在後方者，則以久經封鎖，補充修理均屬不易，即在淪陷區域，亦受敵人聲個國策之限制，並未獲得適當之補充，加以軍事時期，修發維持均極草率，即在未被破壞之各路中，其一切物質設備之實際情况，較之戰前不逮遠甚，據吾人實地查勘估計之結果，長城以南亟待修復之鐵路，即達三千餘公里，修復至戰前標準，即需美金三萬七千餘萬元，此項初步估計之費用，業已超過戰前吾國全部鐵路之內外債務，雖美金之購買能力亦已相當貶削，但吾國鐵路所受損失之鉅，於此亦可見一般矣</p>
<p>戰時後方之交通大部仰賴於公路運輸，大後方十年來之公路建設，亦確有長足之進展，惟淪陷區之公路則大部份多遭破壞，殘餘之其他路綫，亦未得修養維持，其情况之劣，又駕鐵路而過之。</p>
<p>沿海各港口之設備，因軍事行動所受之直接損失固屬輕微，但在此九年中，一切應有之修養維持，均未切實舉辦，致各港口之航道淤塞日甚，碼頭提岸坍塌頗多，其他倉庫，起重，駁運，挖泥等之各項重要設備，亦多散失殘毀，惟日人在佔領華北期中，曾於塘沽白河入海處，開始建築新港，各項工程完成幾及半數，卒以其戰局逆轉，中途停輟，此外敵人在海南島各港，亦小有改進，但規模均小，或僅能適合於當時某種之特殊用途，</p>
<p>黃河長江兩流域暨沿海各地之水利工程，關係吾國國計民生至鉅，亦不幸在此抗戰期中，或因軍事行動，遭受直接之破壞」或以限於環境，無法補修，使其日漸坍毀，而尤以黃河改道，奪淮入江之後，其影響之廣泛，爲害之劇烈，爲數十年來水災中　罕見。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利結束後，中央迅即就我國自身能力之所及，並努力取得聯合國善後救濟總署相當物質上之協助，對於急切需要之交通路綫及水利工程，分別由中央與各地方主管機關，加緊搶修，復以各種工程在戰時所受損毀之實際情狀，及其應行修復之程度，旣待實地考察詳勘，而各項工程之修復程序，亦應權衡輕重緩　，斟酌國家財力，妥　配合　定，且在此次修復之過程中，即應他此機會，將各塡工程過去之　種缺點，及因技術進步應行改進之各點，予以適當之革新改造，更以戰後新興工程待舉者正多，亦應於此時與修復工作同時妥爲規　，予以適當之配合，爲謀迅速完成上述各項計劃工作起見，行政院曾於本年春季，設置工程計劃國，糾合中美專家，專司其事。</p>
<p>經此九個月之努力工作，除根本治理黃河之計劃，現正聘請專家多人繼續硏究贛議外，關於鐵路修復計劃已由該團就國家能力所及，環境所許，斟酌緩急，詳加擬定，此項計劃中，規定各路修復之先後决序，所需修復之時間，並詳細估計其所需要之材料與工款，照目前情勢，自以就長江以南社會秩序較爲安定區域之各路，儘先加以修復，粤漢鐵路之改善與全部修復，爲時尚需兩年，浙贛與湘桂黔等路，則期望能於今後兩年內，恢復原狀，並加以適當之改進，其他大江南北與關外諸路，則當依照擬定之程序，並隨各地方政治與社會情况之演進，逐步趕緊修復，此項修復計劃如能順利付諸實施，長城以南各路，可能於今後兩年內全部修復，此外並於各路機車車輛之運用，機廠電信號誌及行車設備之改善，路用材料機具之供應與管理，擬訂切實革新之方案，關於新路之建設，則自應以溝通西南與西北，並使其與中原暨江南各省直接啣接，是以此新路計劃中，當以完成蘭州至廣州　之綫爲主體，再依序贛修川湘繼路，進而聯接平綏綫上之包頭與隨海綫上之關州，並建築成渝與滇越之聯絡綫，藉以完成全國鐵路綫網之骨幹。</p>
<p>沿海各港殆爲全國水陸運輸系統吐納之咽喉，吾人對於沿海所有較爲重要各港，均曾加以實地查勘，並作詳細之硏討，認爲上海與靑島兩港之整理工作，實已不容再緩，而尤以上海一埠，爲全國對外貿易及物資轉運之樞紐，其修復與改進工作。更應積極推進，他如葫蘆島，秦皇島，福州，廣州，及海南島諸港等處之修復與改進工作，亦不容再事躭延，關於新港之建築，則塘沽新港之工程，應予加連趕進，此乃完成整個北方交通系統之一都份，亦爲開發華北資源所必需，此外則廣州灣港埠之開闢，亦應早爲籌計準備，此處爲華南良好深水港灣之一，又適位於蘭廣幹綫之南端，此港之建修，實爲此幹綫建築計劃之一部，亦應與鐵路施工程序，配合啣接也，厦門港口水深灣闊，實爲東南沿海天然形勢優美之良港，亦應加以改善，使其成爲未來閩贛鐵路出口之港埠。</p>
<p>吾人對於公路之建築管理與經營，曾作若干切實適當，之建議，並曾詳審吾國公路運輸現狀，與將來需要，擬定各區各級公路工程之標準，以爲今後施工之規範，關於國道綫網之擬定，與省道縣道劃分之原則，今後中央之注意，應即着重於聯絡全國各重要經濟政治軍事中心之少數幹綫公路，而以其他各路之建築管理，應委之於各地方政府，務使各地方政府能多分担其應負之　任，至於公路運輸之任務，則應多委之民營，用期公路運輸之業務，得以迅速發展，經營效率得以切實改進，舉凡熱心交通事業之人士，均得有充分盡其所能之機會，國營與民營之交通事業，得以相輔而行，相得益彰也。</p>
<p>勝利後之一年中，政府對於各項交通事業與公共工程之重建，亦曾盡其最大之努力，無如內受整個政局之影響，內戰未戢，匪特若干區域之復興與建設工作，根本上無從進行，大江以北各鐵路，業經接收修復之若干部份，亦在此一年來之內戰中，重遭破壞，且以軍費支應浩繁，國庫奇絀，民力凋敝，能籌集撥用於經濟復員與建設之財源與人力，亦因以大减，各項工程重建之工作，自難迅速推動矣，加以吾國一切基本工礦事業均極微弱，所需用之各項工程材料，大都仍須仰給於外人聯總能撥給於吾國之工程材料，數量旣不數用，而各國在此戰後數年中，對於工程材料之需要，又英不倍蓰　昔，爭先羅致，吾人縱有充份之準備，亦難迅速如數購得，再以戰後船隻奇缺，軍隊復員之運務　重即能在國外獲得大量之建設物料，亦難如期趕運來華，恰能與國內工事之推動，取得調協緊湊之配合，此外則專門技術人員之貧乏，國內交通輸送之不便，工料價格之不斷激漲等等，均適足以妨碍經濟建設事業之復與，直接間接，影響各項公共工程之重建也。</p>
<p>整個環境雖如此困難，但邊去一年中之工程建設亦尚有相當成就，不容槪加抹煞，復負工作開始進行之始，政府即努力於大後方與收復區交通路綫之溝通，長江航綫內妨碍航行之各項障碍，迅即加以掃淸，沿江暨各重要海港之航行標誌等，亦正在逐漸裝復之中，牧復區各重要城市之航空站塲，已能迅加以相當之改進，予接收暨復員工作以莫大之助力，鐵路修復工作，本即較爲艱鉅，需時又較爲長久，復員之初，即就此聯接大後方與收復區，而又爲南北交通大動脈之一之粤洪鐵路，努力加緊修復，此路在戰時被拆毀之長度，幾達四百公里，，軌道材料與機車車輛大都失散，站塲廠房及一切行軍設備多已蕩然無存，本年之初，國外救濟物資尚未到達，不得已乃拆移湘桂鐵路軌道材料達二百餘公里，作爲修復粤漢路之用，一面再盡力收集散佚之零星器材，充分運用本地可產之木料，集中一切人力物力，加速趕進，卒能於本年六月底，全部接通，雖此路原狀之恢復，尚有所待，但此溝通長江與珠江流域之陸上運輸幹綫，能在極短時間內勉力趕通·主事者之功績，亦不可沒也，一沿海各鐵路之修復工作，係先從京滬平津兩區開始，並從武漢濟兩爲中心，着手趕修平漢津浦與膠濟各路，現時京滬滬杭甬兩路之運輸情况，較諸停戰時期，已大有改進山海關外各鐵路北寗鐵路早已隨瀋陽之接收而全綫趕通，雖沿綫各站，仍時受襲擊破壞，但此路之客貨運務，尚能勉强維持，中長鐵路長春至大連一段早已通軍最近隨軍事之進展復將瀋陽至安東之支綫修復至此東九省沿海至南部各重要城市之交通可望暢達張家口收復，平綏全綫軍事，障碍消除之後，平綏鐵路之修復工作，已能加緊趕進，以現時形勢推測，全綫應即能趕通，惟平漢津浦兩路北段之修復工作，時受阻擾，無法繼續推進，正太鐵路雖經兩度趕通，亦因隨時繼續破壞，最近又已不通，同蒲全綫之修復工程，旣爲軍事所阻，又無充份儲備之材料，一時亦無法進行矣。</p>
<p>膠濟鐵路之修復工程，亦係時受阻擾，屢作屢止，最近又已將全綫趕通，今後希望不致再遭破壞，俾此路之運輸業務，得以從此暢通，隴海鐵路綫最長，　關以東盡屬戰區，又適在黃河決口地帶，器材供應亦屬奇乏，經此一年之不斷努力，全綫路綫之修復工作，大體上亦可謂勉告完成。（下接第十版），　勝利一年以來，共軍肆意破壞</p>

<p>勝利一年以來，共軍肆意破壞各路交通，並且上國軍進行受降工作。自十一月十一日政府頒佈之停戰令生效後，國軍恪遵命令嚴守原防，而各地共軍竟仍四出竄擾，共軍領袖且認戰爭爲解決國內糾紛之唯一途徑，且偕稱「人民解放軍」，以朱德爲「總司令」，彭德懷爲「副總司令」，葉劍英爲「參謀長」。朱德最近聲稱：「共軍數額正在擴大中」。據一般估計，共軍除民團的五十萬名外，正規軍不足一百萬，與號稱三百八十萬之衆的國軍一比較，實力上誠有天壤之別。由其行動上窺之，可知共軍將保持游擊戰術，企圖由破壞交通方面打擊整個國家經濟。</p>

<h3>The National Government Proclaims a General Amnesty Order on New Year's Day; Specifies Scope That Arch-Criminals and Heinous Offenders May Not Be Spared Lenience; Measures for Commutation of Sentences to Be Determined by the Judicial Yuan Jointly with the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] On January 1st, the 36th year of the Republic of China, the National Government issued an order stating that modern criminal policy emphasizes the environment and motives behind a crime. Ordinary cases are the main reason for reducing punishment. Our country's eight years of resistance against Japan were exceptionally difficult, and the people lived in instability, easily violating the law, which is clearly different from peacetime circumstances. Now, after victory, on the day when the Constitution of the Republic of China was formulated and promulgated by the National Assembly, the foundation of the nation is permanently laid, and construction is in full swing. It is appropriate to issue a general amnesty in accordance with the law to initiate opportunities for renewal and improvement. However, amnesty should have a scope, and commutation of sentences should also be implemented to ensure that arch-criminals and heinous offenders are not spared lenience, and that all types of crimes and punishments are reduced or exempted accordingly. Therefore, after being instructed by the Legislative Yuan, the following four items of the bill on amnesty and commutation of sentences for criminals were decided: A. Criminals who committed crimes before December 31st, the 35th year of the Republic of China, and whose heaviest original sentence is imprisonment or less, are all pardoned. B. War criminals and the following crimes are not pardoned or have their sentences commuted: (1) Crimes under Articles 2 to 4 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors; (2) Crimes under Articles 2, 3, 5, and 8 of the Regulations for Punishing Corruption; (3) Crimes of killing direct lineal ascendants; (4) Crimes under the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses that are specifically sentenced to death, or sentenced to death or life imprisonment. C. Except for the crimes in item B, criminals who committed crimes before December 31st, the 35th year of the Republic of China, and whose heaviest original sentence is life imprisonment or more, will have their sentences commuted according to the following standards: (1) Death penalty is reduced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 15 years; (2) Life imprisonment is reduced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 10 years; (3) Imprisonment or concurrent fines are reduced by one-half of the term or amount. D. Detailed measures for commutation of sentences shall be determined by the Judicial Yuan jointly with the Executive Yuan. The above regulations should be implemented immediately by the Judicial and Executive branches respectively. From now on, it is hoped that offenders will deeply understand the normalcy of amnesty and abide by the correct path of the law, cleanse their past misdeeds, and strive to become new citizens. If they dare to harbor resentment and retaliate, the law will still be enforced to punish them. Officials at all levels should especially assist the people, rectify customs, and prevent them from lightly violating the law, in order to fulfill the government's utmost intention of showing compassion and granting amnesty. This is the order.</p>
<h3>Promulgation of the New Constitution Marks the Beginning of Democracy; National Celebration of Universal Renewal; Central Leaders to Pay Respects at the Mausoleum and Hold a Group Greeting Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Chairman Chiang and the heads of the Five Yuan signed and promulgated the New Constitution of the Republic of China at the National Government Auditorium at 4:00 PM on the 31st. The ceremony lasted from 4:14 PM to 4:30 PM. The ceremony was simple and solemn and was a great event in Chinese history. The National Government gate and archway were hung with party and national flags, flying in the wind under the sunlight. In the corridor, green palace lanterns and red silver walls reflected each other. The auditorium was decorated solemnly and beautifully, with red cotton palace lanterns hanging from the top, surrounded by colored paper drawings of cotton and the words "Celebrating the Founding Anniversary" and "Celebrating the Promulgation of the Constitution." A platform was set up in front of the center of the hall, with a huge book containing the full text of the Constitution placed on a wooden frame next to the platform. Two drafts of the signing text were prepared on the table, stating as follows: (1) Order of the National Government: The National Assembly has formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China, and it is scheduled to be promulgated on January 1st, the 36th year of the Republic of China, and implemented on December 25th of the same year. Now it is promulgated, this order. (2) Order of the National Government: The National Assembly has formulated the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, and now it is promulgated, this order. The pen prepared on the chairman's table was engraved with "Pen used by Chiang, Chairman of the National Government, to sign the Constitution of the Republic of China, respectfully made by the Civil Affairs Department of the National Government," and the paperweight was engraved with "Savoring plum blossoms lightly while reading." On the right side of the hall were 36 seats for the presidium of the National Assembly, and on the left were seats and desks for the heads of the Five Yuan, arranged in the order of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan. The pens, ink, paperweights, etc. were also specially made. The lower part of the hall was the seating area for 54 Chinese and foreign reporters. At 4:00 PM, Wu Jingheng, Bai Chongxi, Chen Guofu, Yu Bin, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Wang Yunwu, Mo Dehui, Zhang Lisheng, Tian Lan Jin, Liu Hengjing, Hu Shuhua, Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Kuoqing, and other members of the presidium of the National Assembly, as well as Chinese and foreign reporters, arrived one after another. At 3:14 PM, Chairman Chiang, wearing a general's uniform with the Blue Sky White Sun badge, entered the hall amidst music. Everyone stood at attention. The Chairman smiled and nodded frequently, and then took his seat with the heads of the Five Yuan: Song Ziwen, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Dai Jitao, and Yu Youren. Wu Dingchang, the chief of civil affairs, and Wu Siyu, the chief of staff, stood on either side. Under the mercury lights and the sound of cameras, the Chairman and the heads of the Five Yuan signed the Constitution in turn, which took three minutes. The Chairman then flipped through the Constitution once, and then took a group photo with the presidium, exchanged brief greetings, and enjoyed some refreshments before leaving one after another amidst music. The time was exactly 4:30 PM. This grand event in the history of the Republic of China was thus completed.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] On the first day of the year, the capital city celebrated New Year's Day and the completion of the New Constitution. The whole city was decorated with flags and colorful decorations, and all government agencies and schools were closed for three days. In the morning, government leaders paid their respects to the Founding Father at the Mausoleum for the promulgation of the New Constitution, and the public was free to visit the Mausoleum. At the same time, a grand review of the city's defense corps and fire and police drills were held in front of the National Assembly Hall, and a public celebration was held inside the National Assembly Hall. All entertainment venues offered special prices for three days to benefit the public. At 2:00 PM, the Lishi Society held a group wedding for 96 couples. At 3:00 PM, the Zhongzheng Sports Association held a New Year's Day football match at the Lishi Society. In the evening, famous performers broadcast Peking opera on the Central Radio Station. A torch parade will be held on the 2nd, with dragon lanterns participating in the performance. On the 3rd, members of the Drama Association will hold a street costume performance, and a concert and performances of borderland songs and dances will be held in the National Assembly Hall in the evening.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] On New Year's Day, the 36th year of the Republic of China, the National Government formally announced the Constitution of the Republic of China, which was formulated by the National Assembly in accordance with the teachings of the Founding Father, to the people of the country, announcing that the country's founding process has entered the constitutional era. The people of the whole country feel greatly gratified.

All civil and military officials will participate in the grand ceremony.</p>
<h3>Welcoming the New Year by Getting Rid of the Old; Chairman Addresses Fellow Countrymen, Promulgation of the Constitution Fulfils the Long-Awaited Wish of Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Chairman Chiang gave a radio address to fellow countrymen across the country at 8:00 PM on the 31st, titled "Broadcast to Fellow Countrymen on New Year's Day of the 36th Year." The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Countrymen across the country: Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China in the 36th year, and it is the first New Year's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance and the return of the National Government to the capital. Every year on this day, we commemorate the grand vision of the Founding Father in revolution and nation-building and the difficult history of establishing the Republic of China. We examine the current situation of the country, hope for the bright future of the nation, and everyone has an excited and inspired mood to welcome the first festival of the year. But this year there is one more thing to especially commemorate, that is, our National Assembly has formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China, and has stipulated the date of implementation and the order of preparation. The National Government today promulgates this Constitution, completing the long-awaited wish of implementing constitutionalism in the country, and realizing the legacy of the Founding Father and the revolutionary martyrs. This Constitution was made after countless difficulties and thousands of twists and turns to convene the National Assembly. The content of the Constitution takes into account both ideals and reality. It has clear provisions for the equal equality of all ethnic groups in the country, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups, the equal equality of all political parties under the law, and the active protection of the rights and freedoms of the people. The spirit of this Constitution is to gather the opinions of all parties across the country, based on the principles set by the Political Consultative Conference. It can be said that the success or failure of the implementation of this Constitution is a test of whether China can implement democracy, and it also determines the future of national security and survival. From now on, democracy and freedom are no longer empty slogans, but require our countrymen across the country to earnestly exercise their civil rights and fulfill their obligations, and to promote the implementation of the Constitution as scheduled, in order to ensure the long-term peace and stability of the country. This is an epoch-making event since the establishment of the Republic of China, and I would like to especially announce it to my countrymen and express my congratulations to all my countrymen.</p>
<p>Regarding the real difficulties the country has encountered and the suffering the people have experienced in the past year after the victory of the War of Resistance, our government has always regarded it as its own responsibility and has tried its best to find solutions, without ever ignoring it. But there is one important significance that must be pointed out to all our countrymen, that is, we are currently transitioning from the post-war period to the period of restoration and rehabilitation, and from the destruction of war to the period of reconstruction. If any country in the world has suffered such brutal aggression and has undergone such a long and arduous war of resistance for eight years, it cannot immediately restore its pre-war state; this is inevitable and unavoidable. Moreover, before the War of Resistance, China was a country that had not yet completed its nation-building and was backward in everything. After such a long-term war of resistance, the casualties and transfers of population, the depletion of materials, the shaking of the economic foundation, the exhaustion of the financial situation, the destruction of rural and urban areas, the disconnect between production and consumption, and the severe damage to education, culture, and social morality, are not comparable to other countries with solid foundations. During the War of Resistance, I repeatedly expressed to our countrymen the determination to resist Japan and build the nation, to build a completely new China with prosperous and happy Three People's Principles from the ruins, which of course cannot be done within a year and a half. What we regret and are ashamed of today is that after the War of Resistance, we still have to suffer many unnecessary destruction and obstruction within the country. But fellow countrymen must know that the country is owned by our 450 million people, and the times are advancing rapidly and do not allow us to survive by procrastination and delay. We don't need to go back and trace the past year's delay. From today onwards, both the government and the people must work hard with the four words "remove the old and bring forth the new" and work together to innovate day by day. We are now going to implement constitutionalism. The people are the main body of the country. From now on, the fate of the country depends entirely on the people of the country today. Therefore, the government should not shirk its responsibilities, and the people should also fulfill their obligations to the country. Today, I would like to point out the following points to our countrymen across the country:</p>
<h3>The Constitutional Promotion Association May Be Established Next Month</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The organizational measures for the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee are expected to be announced early next month and are currently under negotiation, and it should be established within the next month.</p>
<h3>The Government Exerts the Greatest Patience, Seeking to Achieve Unity and Peace</h3>
<p>First, I want to tell our countrymen that the government's policy of maintaining peace and unity will never change. If China is not unified, it cannot survive, and if it is not unified, it cannot revive. The government must guarantee national unity and social peace, and also has the responsibility to protect the safety of the people's lives and property. But the realization of unity must be achieved through peaceful means. In the past year, the government's painstaking efforts and concessions to seek peace and stop conflicts have been witnessed by the people of the country. Our allied friend General Marshall's efforts over the past year have not only helped us complete the work of sending back 3 million Japanese prisoners and expatriates and recovering lost land and restoring sovereignty, but also, with his extraordinary patience, facilitated our peace and unity in many ways. This pure and just friendship is worthy of our national admiration. Now that the Constitution has been promulgated, the country will quickly enter the open road of democratic constitutionalism. We will expand the foundation of the government, enlist the joint participation of various parties and non-party people, and promote the implementation of politics and strengthen the effectiveness of politics in accordance with the Peaceful Nation-Building Outline decided by the Political Consultative Conference. Although the Chinese Communist Party has refused to participate in the National Assembly and abandoned its responsibility for nation-building, I can simply explain the government's handling of the Communist Party issue, and still adhere to the policy of resolving political issues through political methods. If there is any opportunity to enable the government's political solution to be realized, the government will never give up that opportunity. What the government hopes from the Communist Party is that it will sincerely implement the various agreements that have been established, implement the cessation of conflict, abide by the established plans for restoring transportation and reorganizing and unifying the army established by the Three-Person Conference, and no longer attempt to seize power by force, so that the country can have the opportunity for peaceful construction, and so that the fellow countrymen who have survived the disaster will no longer feel the pain and threat of destroying peace. Apart from this, there is nothing else to ask. The government will never close the door to peaceful negotiations, and also expects the Communist Party to participate in the government, follow the path of democracy, and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. As for promoting constitutionalism, completing restoration, carrying out construction, relieving the suffering of the people, and other things that any government must be responsible for doing, the government will never delay them because negotiations with the Communist Party have not yielded results. In short, the government will, on the one hand, do its utmost to realize democracy and constitutionalism, and on the other hand, exert its greatest possible patience to seek unity and peace. This is the main policy of the government this morning, and it must first be announced to our countrymen across the country.</p>
<h3>May Our Countrymen Correct Perverted Habits</h3>
<p>Second, I hope that our fellow countrymen will correct the perverted habits after the war. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the countryside has been desolate, transportation has been blocked, the urban population has increased, and urban society has shown a perverted prosperity, and the urban atmosphere has exposed endless shortcomings. The most common and dangerous phenomenon in our domestic cities is the complete loss of national morality. In terms of industry and commerce, normal operations are precarious, and speculative and adventurous behaviors are increasing day by day, either evading taxes and smuggling, or deceiving and profiting. In a short period of time, one can become extremely rich, and others follow suit, forming a common practice. The prevalence of usury and the fluctuations of prices are all caused by this kind of profiteering hot money. The impact is that everyone regards getting something for nothing as omnipotent, and has cultivated a mentality of complacency and luck, so that etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame are swept away, this is one. In terms of the general atmosphere, extravagance and waste are unrestrained, and cunning and plunder have become a common practice. Honesty is considered pedantic, and self-respect is ridiculed as backward. The atmosphere of speculation and opportunism has spread from cities to general society. In order to deceive the ignorant masses, some people do not hesitate to reverse black and white, confuse right and wrong, in order to achieve their personal unspeakable purposes. Benefiting oneself without caring for harming others, and even not caring about harming the country, this is two. In terms of the current labor-capital situation, our pre-war construction foundation was already very weak, and national industry was originally very immature. After this war, it was severely damaged. Since the restoration, the good relationship of labor-capital cooperation has been agitated and destroyed by the selfish and self-serving trend in cities. Mutual encroachment and plunder, disputes have arisen every day, and the future of industry is already worrying. If both labor and capital only care about their own interests and cannot cooperate sincerely to maintain the life of this little remaining industry, once factories close down and the economy goes bankrupt, not only will labor and capital perish together, but production will be stagnated, which will inevitably affect the survival of the entire society. Then our economic foundation, which was spared from the enemy's destruction during the war, is instead destroyed by ourselves after the war, wouldn't it become a sinner of the War of Resistance, this is three.</p>
<h3>One Should Be Greatly Ashamed of Luxury and Debauchery, and Regard Speculation and Opportunism as Utterly Evil; Hope Our Countrymen Will Establish a New Atmosphere</h3>
<p>In short, the decline of morality and the degeneration of the spirit, no country or era has ever exposed the phenomenon exposed in our urban society after the war today. This phenomenon is really not what the people who won the eight-year war of resistance should have. When I say this, I not only feel heartache, but I really feel chilled for our country. Cities were originally the gathering place of culture, economy, and outstanding essence, and should be a model for the inland countryside, and also related to international image. But the current situation is like this, how can our country not be ridiculed and despised? The formation of this phenomenon is actually due to the residue of the enemy's and puppets' enslavement influence during the period of occupation, but some people also believe that it is the influence of the endless internal strife. The country cannot be peacefully unified, so the economy cannot be stable, life cannot be stable, and the social people's hearts cannot have a place to rest. Regardless of the reason, I always hope that our urban compatriots, especially the leaders of the industrial, commercial, and cultural circles, will set an example and reverse the declining trend, and must regard luxury and debauchery as great shame and speculation and opportunism as utterly evil, persuade each other, encourage each other, and jointly create a new atmosphere for our country's nation-building. In this time when human desires are rampant and society is floating, everyone should have the determination to reverse the tide and the spirit of changing customs to correct this shameful and sad bad habit. We must not lose heart because of the temporary phenomenon of domestic turmoil. On the contrary, we should be more cautious and firm because of the existence of the internal crisis, and respect and cherish ourselves. We must think of our heroic achievements in the War of Resistance. Even with such a powerful enemy as Japan invading our country for eight years, we finally defeated him. Then, now that the War of Resistance has been victorious and the external troubles have been eliminated, if our people can all give full play to the inherent morality of our nation, be responsible, abide by our duties, understand etiquette, know integrity, correct people's hearts, and promote justice, have a forward-looking goal, and have the courage to move forward, then self-improvement and restoring order from chaos will be as easy as turning one's hand. As the saying goes, "It is up to people," no matter what obstacles cannot hinder our national revival, nor can it prevent us from completing the common cause of building the country.</p>
<h3>Young People Should Understand Right and Wrong and Not Be Swayed by Others</h3>
<p>Third, I hope that our youth across the country will attach importance to the contribution of nation-building. Young students are the masters of the country's future and the hope for the nation's safety and survival. The rise and fall of the country depends entirely on the ambitions and actions of the youth. During our eight years of War of Resistance, the number of young people entering school increased year by year, and talents emerged in large numbers. This is the best phenomenon in the country, but I have observed that the current knowledge youth are often too sensitive to the environment, too demanding of reality, lack self-control, and lack confidence in the future. Therefore, they are easily incited and manipulated by politicians and ambitious people who have ulterior motives. They are influenced by their propaganda and seduced by their temptations. Some are depressed because they are dissatisfied with the status quo, and some are extreme because they have lost hope in politics. In any case, they are all great losses to the country. In fact, in the past year, the government has tolerated how much in order to seek peace, and after eight years of resisting Japan, when our country is working hard to recover, who is it that is allowing our fellow countrymen to suffer such unprecedented pain, misery, displacement, casualties and tragedies again? The facts are there, and they are very clear. Now that the National Assembly has been closed, and the Constitution has been formulated and promulgated, whether the government has the intention of one-party dictatorship and monopoly can be clearly seen. Today I want to especially remind our young people across the country that you must not be swayed by propaganda with ulterior motives and mislead your whole life. When the Founding Father was alive, he once told our revolutionary youth that young people who are determined to revolutionize must first "understand right and wrong and distinguish between interests and harms." Today, our standards for determining right and wrong and interests and harms are very clear. We must support everything that is actively enterprising and helps national construction. Conversely, we must oppose everything that destroys society, disrupts the country, and causes our nation to regress. Isn't this very simple and clear? Young people, you must especially cherish the time of youth, cherish your hard-won and fleeting time, and do not waste your years and wait until you are old to grieve. You must know that what China urgently needs today is nothing more than construction. To improve the lives of our countrymen lies in construction, to overcome economic difficulties lies in construction, to eliminate the pain of unemployment lies in construction, and to consolidate the foundation of the country and to preserve the fruits of victory also lies in construction. Our pre-war construction plans and the only construction achievements were delayed and destroyed by more than eight years of War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the unequal treaties have been abolished, it can be said that all factors hindering construction have been completely cleared. And now is exactly after the Second World War, and the allied countries are mostly willing to actively help us revive and build, how can we give up this rare opportunity that is difficult to obtain and easy to lose.</p>
<h3>Abandon Past Daydreams and Choose the True Path</h3>
<p>Four years ago, when the unequal treaties were abolished, in the book "The Destiny of China," I drafted a statistical table of the ten-year construction plan after the war. Just in terms of senior cadres, it would require 550,000 university graduates. I hope everyone will take another look at this statistical table, and you will know the greatness of our country's construction future and the infinity of contributing opportunities. You have rich knowledge, a good youth, and strong physical strength. Why should you be wandering in boredom and indignation, and consuming yourselves in empty and useless political struggles, instead of contributing to the great cause of nation-building and creating practical benefits for our countrymen across the country? Young people must know that if China continues to be in chaos and destruction, you will suffer the most, and if it is stable and progressing, you will enjoy the greatest honor and happiness in the future. You are in your prime, and you must recognize your responsibilities to the country and the nation, have absolute confidence, and be sure that our success in nation-building after the victory of the War of Resistance is inevitable. No matter what sabotage, it cannot hinder our great cause of construction, and after the construction is successful, our China's future will inevitably be very bright. Only with confidence can you face the facts squarely, only then can you endure hardship, and only then can you work together to fight for a clear China. Young people, abandon your daydreams, choose the true path you should take and move forward, only then will you not fail your life.</p>
<h3>Common Sincere Cooperation to Lay the Foundation for Long-Term Peace and Stability</h3>
<p>My fellow countrymen across the country, our past year can be said to be a year full of worries and a year of missed opportunities. Let's take a look at how many countries in the world that fought side by side with us have already sorted things out and completed their recovery. We must also see how many allied countries with a more abundant material base are still controlling consumption and practicing economy after the war, and how many countries are mobilizing and increasing production to make up for the losses of the war and create post-war prosperity. Even many defeated countries are struggling to survive and develop. Compared to them, we cannot practice economy, nor can we strive to produce. Even our domestic order cannot be universally stabilized. Thinking about this makes me wonder how we can strive to improve ourselves and be ashamed and self-reliant. At this time of the year, I sincerely hope that my fellow countrymen will make a common and consistent effort with the determination to get rid of the old and bring forth the new. Our Constitution has been promulgated, and democratic constitutionalism will be implemented within a year. The realization of peaceful reunification has a common path to follow. As long as everyone cooperates sincerely, assumes responsibility, and lays the foundation for our long-term peace and stability, and promotes the work of our Three People's Principles construction, then our Republic of China's future will inevitably be bright. I sincerely wish our countrymen across the country a happy New Year! (End)</p>
<h3>On the Question of Preparing for Constitutional Implementation, the Youth Party Issues a Declaration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Youth Party recently issued a declaration on the question of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government, hoping that the whole country will cherish this constitution, which has finally been achieved after much hardship. It also offers three points of opinion, hoping that all people will share a sincere spirit and strive to move forward. (1) Truly disseminate the essence of the constitution so that all people can generally understand it; (2) During the transitional period between the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional government, the people should exercise their power to supervise the government; (3) During the transitional period, the government should reform practical political measures.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing for Talks: Government is Preparing for Reorganization, Hoping All Parties Participate So Constitution Can Be Implemented on Schedule</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Zhang Qun arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by night train from Nanjing. In the afternoon, he met with reporters at his private residence and answered questions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) He has met with Mr. Huang Yanpei, Zhang Lan, Zhang Junmai, and others this time, facilitating contact with all parties.</p>
<p>(2) The government is now preparing for reorganization in accordance with the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) to broaden the base of the government, hoping that all parties will participate together so that after the Constitution is promulgated, all constitutional preparatory work can be completed in order and the constitution can be implemented on schedule. Regarding this matter, opinions have been exchanged with all parties.</p>
<p>(3) He hopes and welcomes the CCP's participation in the government.</p>
<p>(4) The government has repeatedly expressed its intention to resume peace talks. Not only has the policy never changed, but it also hopes that peaceful unification can be achieved as soon as possible so that reconstruction work can be actively carried out.</p>
<p>(5) Since last year when Japan surrendered, and I was appointed to represent the government in the peace talks, I have been determined to work tirelessly. I have done my best for anything conducive to the peace talks. There is no new news to report recently, but as long as the CCP is willing to talk, the government is always waiting.</p>
<p>(6) The government did consider sending a representative to Yan'an. If it is truly beneficial to the peace talks and requires me to go, I will not hesitate to go. Finally, the reporter asked: It is rumored that Chairman Zhang will not return to Sichuan and will take up an important position in the central government. Is this true?</p>
<p>Zhang said: Recently, newspapers often "appoint officials" for people casually. I am not the only one who has been appointed. Such rumors are completely unfounded and not worth paying attention to. With that, Zhang bid farewell to the reporters with a smile.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Recently, discussions on the reorganization of the government have moved from Nanjing to Shanghai. Nanjing is in a festive mood. Jiang Yuntian, who had just returned to Nanjing from Beiping, went to Anhui Province at 11:00 am on the 31st. The Democratic League's office was empty, and no one was at the Youth Party's office either. The reporter met Wang Bingnan and Mei Yi at the CCP Liaison Office. Mei Yi gave a few words as a New Year's greeting: "Peace talks may not necessarily have a hopeful outcome, but peace talks will definitely reopen."</p>
<h3>Universities in Beiping Resume Classes Yesterday; Slogans on Peking University Walls Have All Been Removed; Tianjin Mayor Sends Letter to Students of Various Schools Encouraging Resumption of Classes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st] Universities in Beiping City have resumed classes today. Only the Beiping branch of Peiyang University held a supplementary parade today. The reporter visited Peking University, Sino-French University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Chaoyang University and other schools in the city. Students at each school were carrying books and going in and out of classrooms, attending classes as usual. The colorful slogans on the Democracy Wall of Peking University have all been removed, leaving only scattered remnants of slogans. The Dongjian incident, which caused a great uproar, has come to an end. It is reported that Xiang Da, an authority on the history of Sino-foreign transportation, was insulted yesterday for advising some people not to tear down slogans. Xiang Da has therefore submitted his resignation to the school. This afternoon, students of the Department of History held a meeting to resolve to ask President Hu Shi to retain Professor Xiang. In addition, they also questioned Dean Chen Xueping. The Beiping branch of Peiyang University did not participate in the big parade yesterday. Today, in response to the call of the students at the Tianjin headquarters, all students also set off on a parade in the afternoon. More than 300 students distributed leaflets along the way through Xisi, Xidan, East and West Chang'an Street, Wangfujing, and East Jingshan Street, shouting slogans. The content was the same as yesterday. Police were present to protect them along the way, and the order was good.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang University Students to Parade Today</h3>
<p>Suzhou School Authorities Express No Opinion</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 31st] The Beiping American soldier atrocity incident has caused fluctuations in Hangzhou. Zhejiang University students have all asked for leave to strike today and held a general meeting to decide to launch a parade at 1:00 pm tomorrow. Upon hearing this news, Chairman Shen immediately met with Director Li of the Department of Education and summoned the principals of various middle schools in the city to talk, stating that the American soldier atrocity is a legal issue and has nothing to do with the government. The actions of Zhejiang University students are making a mountain out of a molehill and have deviated from the topic, inevitably being used by others. Therefore, the principals of various middle schools stated that the students of their respective middle schools would not participate in the parade. Hangzhou High School also asked for general leave at one point today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 31st] Some students of the National College of Social Education in Suzhou, in response to the Beiping students' protest against the rape of a Peking University female student by an American soldier, organized a support association for the Beiping students' protest against American soldier atrocities, which led to a strike.

However, the authorities of each school have not yet expressed any opinion on this movement.</p>

<h3>Japanese War Criminal Tsurumaru Executed by Firing Squad; Refused to Kneel Stubbornly Before Execution; Only Completely Died After Twenty Shots Were Fired</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Japanese war criminal Kōkichi Tsurumaru was executed in Nanjing on the 31st, dying after twenty shots. The criminal was 49 years old and previously served as a sergeant in the Kempeitai. He illegally killed our soldiers and civilians in the occupied areas and abused cruel torture methods such as waterboarding and feeding to dogs. The evidence of his crimes was clear and obvious. He was arrested in Shanghai after the victory and escorted to Nanjing on February 21 of the 35th year to be tried by the War Crimes Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. On December 18 of the same year, he was sentenced by the tribunal, and on the 30th, he was approved for execution by a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. At 10:50 am on the 31st, the supervising officer Chen Guangyu, accompanied by the clerk Ding Xiang'an and translator Huang Wenzheng, went to the Xiaoying war criminal detention center to open a temporary court. The criminal was brought out, his identity was verified, and he was instructed to arrange his belongings and prepare his will. Then, he was handcuffed and escorted to the Yuhuatai execution ground at 11:40 am. Unexpectedly, after the criminal got out of the prison car, he stood in the middle of the road and refused to move forward. He also insisted on asking for a cigarette. After the supervising officer agreed, he greedily smoked it. Then, the escorting soldiers pushed him to the execution site and ordered him to kneel facing south, but he smirked and refused, shouting three times wildly. The escorting soldiers then blindfolded him with a white cloth. The supervising officer ordered the firing squad to fire, and the execution was carried out by Zhao Xiaozeng, the platoon leader of the guard regiment of the Ministry of National Defense. Amidst the thunderous drumbeat-like cheers of more than a thousand spectators on the hillside, he fired two bursts of submachine gun fire at his back. The criminal remained standing and did not fall. He was struck by a third shot before he fell, but he still did not die. The executioner then fired six more shots, but after a minute, the criminal still struggled to raise his head. At this point, the executioner continued to fire twelve shots, and only after the last three shots hit his head did he finally die. After the autopsy was completed, the local guard dragged him to the back of the mountain for burial.</p>

<h3>Shen Honglie Returns to Hangzhou After Completing Inspection Tour of Wenzhou and Taizhou; Says the Security Situation in Various Places is Still Good</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 31st] Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, returned to Hangzhou at 2:00 pm today after inspecting Wenzhou, Taizhou, and 19 counties in the fourth district for more than a month. He immediately met with our reporter and talked about his impressions of the tour. He believes that the finances of various counties are difficult, and the funding of township offices is even non-existent. The treatment of staff needs to be improved. Fortunately, the county councils are cooperating with the county governments to resolve many difficulties. The collection of land taxes is generally poor due to unclear land registers and slow collection, but there are no irregularities. Education in various counties is also limited by funding, so it is generally felt to be insufficient, especially national education. In the future, the abstract methods of the past should be corrected. In terms of construction, water conservancy projects have been widely launched, but they are still in the initial stages. They will be completed by the end of March next year and will be able to irrigate more than 10,000 acres of land. Regarding road traffic, the roadbed is no longer a problem, but the funding for bridges is not available. No cases of robbery of fishing boats have been heard on the coast of Ningbo and Wenzhou. Fishermen are safe and secure. A fishery loan of 1.4 billion yuan has been approved by the central government, and the only question now is how to distribute it. In terms of security, Taizhou is the best. The road conditions are poor on the border between Wenzhou and Yongle, and there are no bandits in Fuyang and Lishui.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 31st] Xie Wenlong, Director of the Guangdong Construction Department, discussed with Bei Zuyi on the 30th regarding the resolution of construction issues in the province. Xie proposed that it is necessary to absorb overseas Chinese capital or foreign capital for the development and construction of farmland water conservancy and mineral resources in Guangdong, but due to China's foreign exchange restrictions, foreigners are afraid to invest easily. He specifically requested the central government to provide assistance. Bei agreed to this opinion and stated that the provisional measures for foreign exchange control may be revised to meet the needs of domestic industrial construction. According to Xie's estimate, it will be possible to absorb 10 million US dollars in foreign investment, and the province intends to request the central government to borrow 2 billion yuan for the repayment period, which Bei has gladly accepted.</p>
<h3>Loan Applications for Newspapers in Various Places Should First Be Made to Local Branches</h3>
<p>Responsible Person of the Four Joint Offices Speaks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Newspapers in various places, due to the need for working capital, have been asking the Four Joint Offices to request loans from national banks and bureaus. According to the person in charge of the office: The economic difficulties of various newspapers are indeed a fact. Many have come to negotiate loans. Recently, the loan applications of various newspapers in Nanjing have been made individually by the newspapers to national banks. If newspapers in other cities need loans, they must first apply individually to the local branches of the Four Joint Offices or the local national banks. If they apply directly to the headquarters of the Four Joint Offices, they must still be sent to the local branches for investigation of their business and financial situation, as well as their asset and liability status, before they can be approved, which will take time and delay the process.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Administrative Divisions in Yunnan Province</h3>

However, according to various sources, it seems to have been confirmed to be December 31, 1946. The central government made this decision not to pardon the traitors, but to focus on stabilizing social emotions, so the prosecutor's right to prosecute and the victim's right to sue are still unrestricted.</p>

<h3>Welcome to the Start of the Year of Democratic Constitutionalism - New Year's Message, Year 36 of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>Today is New Year's Day of the 36th year of the Republic of China, which is also our nation's greatest national founding anniversary of democracy. The new Constitution of the Republic of China, after being signed by Chairman Chiang, was also solemnly promulgated today, bringing the democratic nation-building history of the Chinese nation to a conclusion. From today onwards, we begin to enter a new era of true democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, at the beginning of the year 36 of the Republic of China, looking back and forward, we can prove that the history of the Republic of China over the past 36 years has been a most important period from decline to revival, from darkness to light. Now that this new page of history is being written, we should accept all the painful lessons we have suffered since the Republic of China, and we should strengthen the confidence we have gained in the process of revolution and resistance against Japan. Starting this year, starting today, let us work together to implement party politics and achieve the final success of democratic nation-building.</p>
<p>We believe that the Xinhai Revolution, the eight-year War of Resistance, and today's nation-building are absolutely one and the same thing. The Xinhai Revolution was based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of the Three Principles of the People, the eight-year War of Resistance was the activation of the nation's self-defense instinct, and today's nation-building is even more the result of the people's desire to build a new independent and autonomous Republic of China. Therefore, although the process can be divided into hardship, resistance, and nation-building, in reality, it is absolutely one and the same thing. The War of Resistance and nation-building are actually an extension of the Xinhai Revolution. At the same time, we deeply believe that the real difficulty of democratic nation-building lies in ourselves, not in the outside world. Looking back at the history of the Republic of China over the past 36 years, on this day in the first year of the Republic, the cornerstone of nation-building planted by Dr. Sun Yat-sen only lasted for a little over a year before it began to shake, and in the fourth year of the Republic, the change of Hongxian occurred. For the ten years from the fifth year of the Republic onwards, warlords were in chaos, the north and south confronted each other, and it was impossible to achieve unification. Later, thanks to Chiang Kai-shek's leadership of the National Revolutionary Army in the Northern Expedition, China was unified under the National Government in less than two years, and it has been nearly 21 years now. During this period, on the one hand, disagreements within the Kuomintang led to several changes; on the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established a Soviet government in Jiangxi, attempting to seize power by force, and after ten years of conflict, the situation began to improve, but foreign troubles followed one after another, eventually evolving into a full-scale war of resistance. Fortunately, our soldiers bravely resisted, day after day for eight years, and finally achieved an unprecedented victory in our history, making our country's international status leap from a semi-colony to one of the five great powers. However, the fruits of victory soon began to rot, and the emotions of the people of the whole country changed from jubilation to astonishment, to sighs, to frustration.</p>
<p>Now, looking back on the past, since the 36th year of the Republic, the country has been in turmoil almost every day. Only a solid and powerful central force, representing the interests of the nation and the country, struggling for survival, can turn danger into safety, transform peril into peace, and finally overcome any difficulties it faces. Taking the domestic situation after the victory as an example, after the Japanese army surrendered, the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party followed. The Communist army not only "competed to accept surrender" with the government everywhere, but also destroyed transportation in various places, preventing the work of repatriation and reception from proceeding. Later, the CCP willingly took the lead in openly expanding its territory by force, fighting for cities and land, which led to the outbreak of a war of all evils. The flames of war spread from North China to Northeast China to northern Jiangsu, burning half of China. The government, knowing the people's urgent desire for peace, repeatedly engaged in peace talks with the CCP and issued ceasefire orders, but it was never able to achieve domestic peace. Even today, as we celebrate New Year's Day, celebrate the new Constitution, and commemorate the Xinhai Revolution, the wars in various places have not abated under the CCP's offensive. The severity of this situation is truly unimaginable. At the same time, because the war has not stopped, national transportation is blocked, industry and commerce are depressed, prices are soaring, and the people are living in misery, the Republic of China has once again encountered an unprecedented difficulty, the severity of which even exceeds that of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>However, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the government fully demonstrated the spirit of doing its best. No matter how difficult the environment, it still moved step by step towards the two major goals of "political democratization" and "nationalization of the army." Although the National Assembly was repeatedly postponed due to the demands of factions, it finally opened in late November of last year and completed the great task of writing the constitution. Although the content of the new Constitution is not perfect, it has lofty ideals and takes into account reality. It can be said to have been created by synthesizing the opinions of various parties in the country. The British and American media have praised it. Today, the National Government solemnly promulgates it. All people who truly love the country and the nation should warmly celebrate it, wishing it to become the code of conduct followed by the 400 million people of the Republic of China, and wishing it to truly promote China's entry into a new era of peace and democracy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the 36th year of the Republic of China is our nation's year of democratic constitutionalism. Standing at the beginning of this year, looking forward to the future of the Republic of China, our belief that nation-building will surely succeed is even stronger, and our eyes are filled with the light of hope. However, "be cautious in planning the beginning of things." We should make even greater efforts and be even more cautious at the beginning of this year of democratic constitutionalism. The National Assembly representatives who will implement the constitution will be elected this year, and the first president will also be elected this year. How closely related this year is to the future of democratic nation-building! We only hope that the wars and sufferings of the 35th year will be like yesterday's death, and that the peace and democracy of the 36th year will be born from today. Finally, we respectfully wish the success of the year of democratic constitutionalism!</p>

<h3>Atomic Energy Commission Report Passed - US Wins Major Moral Victory - Baruch Says the Day of Achieving Atomic Control is Still Far Away - Future Development Depends on the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 30th] After the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission passed the draft report with ten votes today, US representative Baruch, the drafter of the draft, said that the passage of the report was a moral victory, but because the Soviet Union still opposed some parts of it, it is expected that the day of realizing the prohibition of atomic weapons is still quite far away. Baruch also said that the next stage will be the drafting of an international convention on the control of atomic energy by the Security Council. The convention will be discussed chapter by chapter in detail, and all countries can raise objections as much as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting today. Despite strong opposition from the Soviet Union, the US atomic energy control plan was passed by a large majority of ten votes to zero and immediately transferred to the Security Council for discussion, but there is still a possibility of being vetoed by the Soviet Union. The final form of the US plan is included in the interim report of the commission. When voting, the Soviet Union and Poland abstained, and China, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands enthusiastically supported it. French representative Parodi declared that he agreed with the substantive aspects of the case, but wished to remove the words "no veto power" in the section on punishing the treaty. Soviet representative Gromyko, although he did not vote, strongly attacked the US plan, predicting that the Soviet Union may use its veto power in the Security Council to strike down the report, or at least strike down the provision that the five major powers should waive their veto power in punishing countries that violate the atomic energy control agreement. Polish representative Lange publicly expressed this concern, saying that his abstention was due to the feeling that the report contained provisions that the five permanent members could not accept. The United States has made every effort to fight for the section that no veto power should be used for punishing countries that violate the atomic control code. The report, which is 89 pages long, has established a foundation for the US advocacy of a complete system of international control and supervision. All the issues have been included in the report and passed section by section by the plenary meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission. Except for the provision on the veto power, which was fiercely debated, at least ten of the twelve members of the commission fully supported it. US representative Baruch was determined to request that the words "no veto power" be specifically included and submitted for a vote. The report is generally in accordance with Mr. Baruch's proposal of June 14, advocating the implementation of an international control and supervision system. The main points of the agreement are as follows: (1) Prohibit the manufacture, storage, or use of atomic weapons; (2) Existing atomic weapons should be disposed of; (3) Stipulate the complete freedom of implementation of supervision; (4) Establish institutions to promote the exchange of basic knowledge about atomic energy; (5) Specifically stipulate the acts of sabotage that constitute international crimes and the methods of punishment; (6) Serious acts of sabotage must be immediately reported to the signatory countries of the agreement, the United Nations General Assembly, and the Security Council of the United Nations; (7) No veto power is allowed to protect those who deliberately violate the agreement. Gromyko once again used English to refuse the US request to abolish the veto power for atomic energy control, and suggested that the plan be discussed item by item. It is said that this is the most urgent meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Soviet government believes that all the shortcomings in the US draft should be removed.</p>
<h3>French Reinforcements Arrive in Vietnam - Viet Minh Determined to Resist Long-Term - French Side Claims Confidence in Restoring Order</h3>
<p>[United Press, Saigon, 30th] French military commander in Vietnam, Leclerc, declared today that the war with the Viet Minh forces may not end quickly. French reinforcements have arrived and order can be expected to be restored, but the situation may not be calm within a few days. Leclerc plans to go to Tokyo soon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 31st] The governor's office and the vicinity of the train station here were shelled by Viet Minh troops last night, suffering slight damage, but there were no casualties. At dawn this morning, French artillery returned fire on the Viet Minh positions on the sea embankment. At the same time, aircraft were dispatched to bomb them. In the Hue area, the Viet Minh forces continued to exert strong pressure on the city. The battles in other areas are calm.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th] "Paris Soir" published Overseas Minister Moutet's remarks in Vietnam, saying that France is prepared to negotiate a solution to the Vietnam issue, but France intends to ensure the safety of its military and civilians in Vietnam before considering the details of a political agreement with the Viet Minh. France has never rejected any suggestions or reviews that may be helpful in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>At the same time, former French military commander in the Far East, Leclerc, declared in Saigon that French reinforcements are heading to Vietnam, and France is confident in restoring order. Leclerc is now personally leading the French troops. The new war in Vietnam is mostly concentrated near Nam Dinh, where the Viet Minh forces are attacking fiercely. The siege of the two ports of Hue and Do Son is becoming tighter. The Viet Minh radio broadcast that the Viet Minh army counterattacked the French army positions south of Hanoi and recaptured a police station. The Viet Minh artillery continued to bombard the French army positions. The Viet Minh artillery fire destroyed the top floor of the Banque de l'Indochine building east of Nam Dinh, causing many French casualties. French aircraft strafed a local Viet Minh civilian hospital with machine guns. Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh recently convened a cabinet meeting in a certain place, reaffirming his determination to resist indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Montgomery's Trip to the Soviet Union - Very Profound Intentions - Insightful Views of British Military Figures</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] Regarding British Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to Moscow, British military figures neither confirmed nor denied whether a staff meeting was held before Montgomery's departure. According to well-informed sources, the purpose of Montgomery's trip is to study the trip of transportation and supply experts Generals Roberts and Gartson to Moscow. If studying military strategy issues, he will request his most capable assistant, air force strategist General Simpson, to accompany him. It is heard that the main purpose of Montgomery's trip is to ease the rift within the Labour Party and those who oppose Foreign Secretary Bevin's foreign policy. According to reports, after Montgomery successively made speeches in the United States, Canada, and Austria, there were widespread rumors that the United Kingdom and the United States would conclude a military alliance, which led to an increasing number of people in the United Kingdom opposing Foreign Secretary Bevin's policy. Therefore, after Montgomery returned to the country from Austria, he remembered that Soviet leader Marshal Stalin had invited him to visit the Soviet Union during the Potsdam Conference. Judging from this, Montgomery's trip to Moscow was actually initiated by himself.</p>
<h3>Japanese Discovered Uranium Ore in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 30th] According to a Tokyo dispatch from Huo Cheng, it has been confirmed by the Resource Group of the MacArthur Headquarters that the Japanese discovered uranium ore in the Northeast during the war. It is said that "the uranium ore is located 150 miles northwest of Lushun, which is now under Soviet military control. As of today, American experts have not been able to determine how much uranium ore was mined in Poland during the war, but they believe that a large amount of iron was moved for other purposes."</p>
<h3>Peking Opera Program Performed in London</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] The son of the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Zhang Tianlong, has formed a Peking Opera troupe and is scheduled to perform at the Westminster Theatre in London on January 20. This is the first time that Peking Opera has been performed in England.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Issues New Year's Message to the Japanese - The Future of Japan Depends on Repentance and Reform</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] Allied Supreme Commander General MacArthur issued his New Year's message to the Japanese today. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>"In the past year, all parties have deeply believed that Japan's social system has made considerable progress. This progress is along the most progressive and free path, and is based on the concepts of equal opportunity and personal freedom, thereby enhancing the dignity, welfare, and joy of the people. In 1946, what we have accomplished is numerous, and what remains to be completed is also not small. 1946 can be called the year of reform. The Japanese government representing the people has been established, and the Japanese people have also obtained the right and opportunity to live freely. Many Japanese leaders are able to devote themselves to solving Japan's problems, and most Japanese people are also determined to abandon the past and create a better future. Everything in Japan in the coming year will further affect the welfare of the Japanese people in the next generation. The new Constitution will come into effect next year, and land reform will also be implemented successively. The Japanese people will also have the opportunity to elect new leaders using their own will. Reform and freedom will be immortal, or the problems that need to be solved urgently will become a fleeting moment. This depends on the Japanese people to decide for themselves. The Japanese people are now facing a lot of everything in Japan today, and will affect the future of Japan. The Japanese people will understand and uphold this opportunity, and resolutely deal with various problems. This is my wish and my firm wish. Japan's recovery depends on this, and the Japanese people's future opportunities for peace and happiness also depend on this, and the hopes of the people of the Far East to strive for civilization also depend on this."</p>
<h3>Rumor Has It That the Soviet Union Agrees to the Establishment of a Federation in Germany - The Establishment of a Central Government Is Problematic</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] The rumor that the Soviet Union intends to support the proposal to establish a federation in Germany at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March next year has surprised well-informed diplomatic circles here. The Soviet Union's most recent statement on the German issue was the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference in New York in early December. The future administrative issues of Germany were listed as the second item on the agenda. Until now, it has generally been expected that the Soviet Union will support the establishment of a central government when discussing the political system of Germany. Well-informed sources believe that this is actually a matter of degree. Therefore, although the Soviet Union will support the federal system, it will not oppose the establishment of a central administrative system. It is expected that the Foreign Ministers' Conference will determine the powers of the central and local governments when discussing this issue, and when should a central government be established. The main factor that is not suitable for the establishment of a central government system is the disparity in the opinions of political parties in the occupied areas.</p>
<h3>Saar Issue - French Actions - British and American Concerns</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] Radio Hamburg said that the French military authorities announced several measures restricting entry into the Saar area. In the future, Germans will not be allowed to enter the Saar without a special pass. Each person may not carry more than one hundred marks. Until further notice, parcels may not be delivered to the Saar.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] A broadcast from Paris on the 31st: General Clay, commander of the US military district in Germany, declared that the French decision to militarily occupy the Saar area was a unilateral action. This statement was resolutely denied by the French authorities today. It is said that Bidault's representative, Muville, revealed the French intention in this regard at the Four-Power Conference in New York.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] Reliable sources say that after the French authorities in the Saar area established a tax inspection system at the border between that area and other parts of Germany, the British government has asked the French government to inform it of the various administrative orders regarding this matter. The French representative only informed Bevin of the general situation in New York, but the details have not yet been known to the British side.</p>
<h3>Possible Release of Japanese War Criminals Shigemitsu, etc.</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] When the Far East Military Tribunal opened today, the prosecutor continued to state the defendants' atrocities of abusing prisoners of war, but the court seemed to no longer feel interested in this. It is now eagerly awaiting the return of US Attorney General Keenan from the United States in mid-next month. Because reliable sources believe that Keenan may agree to release three or four defendants, especially former Governor-General of Korea, General Minami, former Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, and former Minister of Finance Kaya. Also, when General Minami appeared in court today, he had shaved off his hair and beard, surprising reporters and photographers. The prisoner claimed that his shiny head was better for the New Year.</p>
<h3>US Military Command in the Pacific to Be Unified</h3>
<p>Towers to Serve Concurrently as Chief of Staff</p>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 30th] US Pacific Fleet Commander Towers said today that the US Pacific Area Joint Staff, approved by General Nimitz, will be established on New Year's Day in 1947. Thereafter, the command of the US Navy, Army, and Air Force in the area will be unified. It is said that this is the most complete joint staff organization below the Washington Staff. The Chief of Staff of the department will be concurrently served by Towers.</p>
<h3>Dissolution of the Western Republican Government Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] The representative delegation of the Spanish Republican Government in London has seriously denied the claim that the government may be dissolved. The statement said that the cabinet meeting held by the government in Paris last Friday was only for the Prime Minister of the government, Gillard, who had returned from the United States, to report on the mission to the United States. The Republican government cabinet will meet again in one day to discuss measures to make the most of the United Nations General Assembly's recommendation that all countries recall their ambassadors to Spain.</p>
<h3>Soviet Diplomat Criticizes Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>Announces Resignation and Seeks Asylum in the United States</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 31st] Alexander Lev, Assistant Commercial Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, announced through a lawyer in New York today that he had resigned and sought asylum in the United States. The lawyer told reporters that Mr. Lev had criticized the policies of the Soviet government, based on the principle that the Soviet people were completely isolated from democratic countries, especially the United States.</p>

<p>The Mayor Expresses His Unwillingness to Say Empty Words</p>
<p>A reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon, asking him to express his feelings about the past year and his prospects for this year. The Mayor politely declined, with a bitter smile on his face, saying: "Everything is a mess, I don't want to speak at this time." The reporter then asked what would be the focus of the Municipal Government's work in the 36th year. Mayor Wu said: "You can generally see it in the budget compiled by the Municipal Government."

<p>Yesterday was New Year's Eve. Commander Xuan Tiewu issued a public security plan, saying that this year's plan has not yet been formulated. The work of the garrison headquarters should be determined according to the changes in the social environment. The economic recession in Shanghai is enough to affect the social order. Therefore, the public security situation in Shanghai recently is worse than it was two months ago, especially in the suburbs of Shanghai, where banditry has repeatedly occurred. I will do my best to protect the public security of this city. Commander Xuan expressed his strong opposition to businesses operating all night on New Year's Eve, stipulating that all entertainment venues must close at 12:00 PM.

<h3>Exhibition of Anti-Japanese War Documents Begins About 5,000 Exhibits Awe-Inspiring and Enraging</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese War Documents Exhibition, organized by the Yokohama Bridge Municipal Museum, opened at 9:00 AM today. The venue has two large exhibition halls and one large exhibition corridor, with a total of 5,000 exhibits. The first exhibition hall displays tragic documents from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War and heroic documents from underground workers. The second exhibition hall displays the evil deeds of the Japanese puppets. Among the Anti-Japanese War documents, there are complete sets of war photographs from Shanghai, various propaganda materials, and special publications, many of which are precious items. Among the underground work documents, there are portraits and mementos of various martyrs, as well as propaganda materials and secret documents of underground work. For example, there are special cabinets displaying the portraits and posthumous writings of Ms. Zheng Pingru. A kidney cut off from Comrade Zeng Menglin after he was subjected to brutal torture by the enemy puppets is also on display. Among the documents of the evil deeds of the Japanese puppets, there are large-scale color advertisements and small items such as chips from gambling dens, all of which are on display in various forms. There are also many rare items that are not commonly seen, such as various secret documents of the Japanese puppets' control and oppression of the people of Shanghai. The 100,000-yuan banknotes of the Central Reserve Bank and the "Military and Civilian Return Certificates" issued by the Japanese, on the one hand, counterfeited our legal currency, and on the other hand, printed images of real women, attempting to lure our military and civilians with pornography, which is particularly infuriating to see. It is heard that the museum is collecting admission tickets at a price of 500 yuan per person at the request of the Social Education Staff Welfare Foundation to replenish the welfare fund.</p>
<h3>Citywide Population Statistics Total Number is 4,090,000</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau held centralized training sessions for household registration personnel in various districts in September of this year. After the training was completed, starting from October 4th, all district office staff and Baojia chiefs were mobilized to re-examine household registration and carry out household registration transfer work in various districts. By early December, the work of transferring the original and duplicate copies in each district was completed. Then, based on the transferred population, the strip paper collation method was used to carry out various statistics, including: (1) population gender statistics, (2) population origin statistics, (3) population age distribution statistics, (4) population education level statistics, (5) population occupation distribution statistics, and (6) population marital status statistics. These types of statistics are all based on the "current resident population" as the standard, and the floating population that comes and goes frequently is separately compiled into "floating population" statistics. According to the statistics of this re-examination of household registration, the current resident male population of the city is 2,108,176, the female population is 1,657,935, totaling 3,766,111. The floating population of the city, including both men and women, is 260,444. Adding the foreign population of 63,985 men and women, the total population of the city is 4,090,540.</p>

<h3>A Gang of Thieves Cracked Down in West Shanghai Five Main Culprits Arrested, Others at Large</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, a series of theft cases have occurred in the Xinqiao Police Sub-bureau area in the western suburbs of Shanghai, with even several households being robbed in a row. It is reported that the gang of bandits has gathered forty or fifty people, possessing modern weapons, such as Tommy guns, Mauser pistols, and automatic firearms. After the sub-bureau cooperated with the General Bureau's special patrol team, motorcycle team, and criminal investigation officers to investigate, they finally obtained clues at 7:00 PM the night before. It was learned that several fierce bandits were discovered on the banks of the Suzhou River in Huacao.

<h3>Municipal Government Receives Car Embezzlement Case Indictment of Chen Wusong and Feng Peifang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The municipal government's car embezzlement case, since being transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office by the investigation team, has been under investigation for more than two months. The prosecutor in charge, Cao Hong, has formally filed a public prosecution of the case the day before yesterday. The defendants, Chen Wusong, the former director of the Municipal Government's Vehicle Affairs Office, and Feng Peifang, the manager of the Wantai Repair Shop, are suspected of violating Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 3, Paragraph 6, and Article 5 of the Anti-Corruption Regulations due to discrepancies in the repair of sixteen cars. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Prosecutors Continue to Survey the Site of the Plane Crash</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Three prosecutors from the District Prosecutor's Office, Cao Hong, Wu Qihua, and Ji, continued their investigation into the tragic plane crash yesterday. At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, they went to Longhua Airport to meet with Chen Wenkuan, the chief of the flight group of the China National Aviation Corporation, to inquire about the radio communication between the crashed plane and the ground. According to the response, Flight 49 maintained good communication with the ground after taking off from Nanjing at 3:23 PM, and lost contact only after receiving its last communication at 5:27 PM. The plane was said to have crashed at Zhanghuabang, Jiangwan, at 5:58 PM. It was also said that the company authorities are also investigating the issue of responsibility, but the pilot and telegraph operator of the plane have died or been injured, making the investigation quite difficult. The three prosecutors then met with Chen, the deputy director of the Flight Group of the China Aviation Corporation, and Du Weidi, the representative of the Yellow Society stationed at the airport. According to the discussion, the personnel on the two crashed planes had all received telecommunications training. As for why they could not use radar at the time, it was thought that it was due to the influence of the weather, which hindered the radio waves. The three prosecutors were then led by Chen and Du to survey the terrain at the crash site of Flight 140. They also went to the crash site of Flight 115 at Heta Temple in the fifth district of Shanghai County, where they saw that the body of the plane was not completely destroyed, but the main hall and pagoda of Heta Temple had been demolished. The prosecutors questioned nearby residents about the situation before and after the accident, and returned to Shanghai at 5:30 PM. After the three prosecutors completed the on-site survey, the second step will be to summon the company负责人, the families of the victims, and the injured passengers on the plane for questioning.</p>
<h3>Murder for Money on New Year's Eve A Prostitute Dies Tragically, the Patron Flees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] On New Year's Eve, a murder for money case occurred at the Zhang Apartment Brothel, No. 49 Zhucun, Liulu, Baxianqiao. The deceased was a prostitute named Wu Lingdi, 20 years old, from Suzhou. At about 7:00 PM last night, a patron, about 30 years old, wearing a blue long gown and cotton shoes, had a change of heart after the entertainment, and strangled the prostitute with her own waistband and handkerchief, robbing Lingdi of a gold ring with her name on it (weighing three maces) and a gold chain bracelet (weighing about seven maces), and moving the body under the bed before calmly escaping. At 8:00 PM, another prostitute in the brothel, Zhu Eryuan, entered the room and saw that the bedding on the bed was messy and there was a large pool of water stains in the center. She called for Lingdi but received no response, which aroused suspicion. Later, she saw the corner of a purple camel hair coat peeking out from under the bed. She lifted the edge of the bed and saw Lingdi's gruesome corpse. The prostitute witnessed the tragedy and immediately screamed for help. The madam, Jiang Jiangshi, telegraphed the Taishan Police Sub-bureau, which sent officers to investigate and took photos of the body before sending it to the morgue for examination. The person in charge of the brothel was also taken to the bureau for interrogation last night. According to Zhu Eryuan, the murderer had stayed at the brothel with the deceased the night before, paying 40,000 yuan for the night. This was his second time, so she did not suspect anything. The deceased currently lived at No. 74 Guian Lane, Xibinan Road, and is survived by an elderly mother, who is over 70 years old and has recently been bedridden.</p>

<h3>High Court Summons Film Industry Figures Only Mei Xi Arrives at Court Questioned for Half an Hour Released on Bail of 20 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the High Prosecutor's Office summoned the fourth batch of nine film and drama figures who had collaborated with the enemy, including Zhang Shanxian, Chen Yunshang, and Mei Xi. It was not until 10:20 AM that only Mei Xi, the male lead of "Spring River Regret," arrived at court. Mei wore a brown old wool felt hat, a floral checkered scarf around his neck, a faded blue cloth robe, and a pair of black felt tongue shoes. His face was long and slightly weathered.</p>
<p>Before being questioned by the prosecutor, Mei Xi spoke eloquently to reporters about his opinions and feelings. He said, "The reason why I did not comply with the summons in the first three times was because I was preparing a "Yin Yuan" movie theater in Jiujiang, specializing in domestic films. It took five days to return to Shanghai from Jiujiang. This accusation is justified, and whether I am guilty or innocent should be clarified. He joined "China Film" because he was originally in "China United," and "China Film" was reorganized from "China United." The original contract was still valid, so he continued to work for "China Film." He made many films in the past, but the problematic one was "Spring River Regret." The film was directed by Yue Feng, and the script was also modified by Yue Feng. Before filming "Spring River Regret," the Japanese had offered five scripts, asking us to film them, but we refused. If we didn't film this film, "China Film" would have been completely taken over by the enemy. Zhang Shankun, in order to persuade us to film this film, said that he was willing to write a guarantee to us, guaranteeing that he would be solely responsible, but our relationship with Zhang was too deep, and we didn't want him to write a guarantee. Mei Xi also admitted that "Spring River Regret" was an anti-British and American historical drama, violating the national policy of resisting Japan, but claimed that it was forced by circumstances. According to him, Yue Feng is probably in the Northeast, and Zhang Shankun and Chen Yunshang are still living in Hong Kong. After the interrogation, he vowed not to return to Jiujiang and will wait for news from the High Prosecutor's Office in Shanghai.</p>
<p>He was summoned for questioning at 10:50 AM, which lasted about 30 minutes. The prosecutor ordered him to be released on bail of 20 million, available at any time. When he came out, in order to avoid being photographed, he pressed his wool felt hat down. A bailiff followed him to find bail. Looking at the back of his swaying old blue cloth robe, I felt some sorrow for this declining artist who lacked clear understanding and had an unstable will.</p>

<h3>Two Murderers in the Sex Scandal Case High Court Still Sentences Them to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the sex scandal case in Taishan Apartments, the murderers Lin Buwu and Wang Zhengzhong were sentenced to death by the District Court. Lin and Wang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday morning, the High Court pronounced its judgment, "Lin Buwu and Wang Zhengzhong's murder conviction is upheld." The court session was held at the High Court in Tilanqiao yesterday morning. The families of Lin and Wang were unaware of this beforehand, so they did not go. Unexpectedly, the two criminals, because they were still sentenced to the most severe punishment and because they could not see their families, revealed their fierce nature, roared in the courtroom, and tried to beat the bailiffs. They were taken back into custody after being severely reprimanded by Chief Hu.</p>

<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>May Everyone Demonstrate a Spirit of Service</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The beginning of a new year marks a new beginning for everything. The year 35 has passed quickly, and the year 36 is coming. We are full of infinite hope at this beginning of the year, and we would like to offer a word of encouragement to our beloved readers.</p>
<p>"The purpose of life is service." Everyone knows this truth, and everyone can say it, so everyone takes the word "service" for granted, and as a result, they let it pass by lightly. Service, service, merely becomes a slogan, a facade with a name but no substance!</p>
<p>Service does not have to be ambitious or based on profound theories. It only requires facing reality, accepting it with humility, practicing it physically at any time and in any place, doing as much as one can with one's ability, not caring about rewards, not complaining about labor, not distinguishing boundaries, and not harming others for personal gain. It also requires courage and perseverance, which is the true meaning of "service."</p>
<p>Baden-Powell founded the Boy Scouts, and his vow included: first, to fulfill national responsibilities; second, to help others at any time and in any place; and third, to abide by Boy Scout rules. These three items seem ordinary and insignificant, but if you experience them carefully, which one does not contain the meaning of service? Therefore, if someone has received Boy Scout training and can truly abide by it for life, he is always a practitioner of "social service."</p>
<p>In China after the victory, political struggles have not ended, everything has not entered the right track, people's livelihoods are becoming more and more haggard, and there are many difficulties! But we must not be discouraged or passive. Everyone should have the mentality of sharing joys and sorrows and helping each other, seeking welfare for the public, and serving the people. The colleagues in this column are weak and have little ability, and are ashamed of not making contributions. They are willing to offer a single idea and do their best. We hope that everyone will supervise and teach us at any time, so that we can see the results.</p>
<h3>U.S. Marines in Beiping Insult Female Student: Student Protests from Various Schools in the City</h3>
<p>Following the incident of U.S. Marines stationed in Beiping insulting a female student from Peking University, the Beiping Municipal Government immediately lodged a serious protest with the U.S. military authorities, proposing four demands: (1) The offending criminals should be swiftly and publicly tried and punished in China; (2) The U.S. authorities should apologize to and console the victim, and compensate the victim for all losses to her body, reputation, and mental well-being; (3) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future; (4) The local U.S. military authorities should seek closer cooperation with the Chinese authorities to maintain the traditional friendship between China and the United States. The U.S. military authorities indicated that they would fully accept the above points once the two detained U.S. soldiers were tried and their guilt was established, and expressed their deepest apologies. It is expected that the U.S. military authorities stationed in Beiping will be able to handle this unfortunate incident according to law and seek a reasonable solution in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Law School Held Classes as Usual Yesterday</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, students in Beiping were filled with righteous indignation and went on strike and demonstration to protest. Students in our city also expressed their indignation. However, apart from Jinan, Jiaotong, Fudan, Shanghai Law School, and others that responded to the strike, the rest adopted a calm and composed attitude. The majority of students believe that although this incident is a great misfortune, it stems from the illegal actions of one or two soldiers and is purely a legal matter, with no direct relationship to the issue of the stationing of U.S. troops in China, and should not be exaggerated excessively, so as not to affect the traditional friendship between China and the United States. Therefore, most school students, in addition to expressing anger or issuing declarations protesting the atrocities of the U.S. military, did not take actions such as strikes and demonstrations. The Shanghai Law School, which went on strike the day before yesterday, resumed classes yesterday. Although Jinan, Fudan, Jiaotong and other schools continued their strike yesterday, today is New Year's Day, and all schools will be closed for three days starting today. After the holiday, they will prepare for the semester exams, so schools that went on strike from the fourth will be able to resume classes as usual.</p>
<p>Conflict at Jinan University Over Resumption of Classes</p>
<p>This time, the strike action taken by some schools in the city was instigated by one or two professors who used the issue to achieve their political propaganda goals. For example, Jinan University, which was the first to implement the strike, had already decided to resume classes yesterday and held classes as usual at 8 a.m. However, during the class, a small number of students made a commotion and continued the strike, resulting in several conflicts. Three students who opposed the strike, Tan Liyan, Pan Rong, and Dan Jiarui, were assaulted and injured one after another. Tan and others have decided to file a lawsuit according to the law. Pan Xingzhao, an employee of the school's counselling office, and some other students were also押至 the auditorium for a "public trial." The director of student affairs, Wang Yingsan, was also severely humiliated for protecting the assaulted students, and the detained students were not released until around 3 p.m., when order gradually returned.</p>
<p>Schools Support Student Union Declaration</p>
<p>The Student Union of this city issued a letter to all students the night before last to protest the atrocities of the U.S. military, and continued to request the government to lodge a solemn protest with the U.S. military, while opposing strikes and逃行. This attitude has been widely supported by the student community in this city. It is learned that the student unions of Datong, the College of Political Science and Law, Tongde Medical College and other schools have risen to express their support for the Student Union's declaration.</p>
<p>In order to protest the atrocities of the U.S. military in Beiping, students of Datong University convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the school's student union and decided on two basic attitudes: 1. Launch a joint protest by all students; 2. Decide not to take strike action. After the meeting, Standing Committee members Lin Jiping, Ni Wenjiong, and Chen Guangde jointly posted a notice explaining the reasons for adopting the above attitude and put forward specific demands and protests to the government: 2. Punish the U.S. military who caused the trouble; 3. Ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. All students in the school unanimously supported the resolution of the student union.</p>
<p>The student union of Shanghai College of Political Science and Law sent a letter to the Student Union yesterday, expressing their support for the union's declaration.</p>
<p>The class union of Zhoude Medical College held an emergency meeting yesterday and unanimously passed the following points: (1) Regarding the atrocities of the U.S. soldiers, please the government lodge a serious protest; (2) Sympathize with the victimized students and send a telegram of condolences; (3) Demand an apology and compensation from the U.S. side, and guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future; (4) Support the Student Union's declaration on the incident; (5) Strictly prevent conspirators from taking advantage of the situation and expanding the situation; (6) Resolutely oppose strikes and demonstrations that affect students' studies. All students in the school supported the resolution.</p>
<p>Shanghai Business College held a general student assembly at 3 p.m. yesterday, with more than 300 people attending. It was resolved that "on the principle of not going on strike, we will take concerted action with students from various schools."</p>

<h3>Goods with Consular Visas Do Not Guarantee Importation. Importers Responsible for Damages if Goods are Shipped Without Permits.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Executive Committee of the Temporary Administration Committee for Imports and Exports, because of the public's lack of clarity regarding the import of goods, issued a statement yesterday stating that, regarding the import of goods, at the beginning of December of this year, the Committee had sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to re-advise Chinese consulates abroad to continue issuing consular visas according to past practice. However, the issuance of a consular visa does not guarantee that the goods in question will receive a permit at customs. According to reports from various parties, there have been several instances where overseas consulates have failed to comply with the telegram order. The Committee has already sent another letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urging them to pay attention.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee issued a notice to importers on the same day, stating that, according to Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for Amending Import and Export Trade, all imported goods, except those prohibited from import and those stipulated in Article 14, must apply for an import permit. If an importer ships goods before obtaining the import permit and damage occurs as a result, he shall be responsible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chen Changtong, the Chief Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Committee, has recently hired Yu Yingjie, an auditor from the Bank of China stationed abroad, to assist with affairs due to his busy schedule. Mr. Yu has returned to Shanghai from the United States and will now be stationed in the office on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>An Official from the Import Management Committee Told Reporters: The Committee has begun the process of reviewing applications from various importers this week, starting with the limited allocation of important imported oils and rubber, and then proceeding in an orderly manner. However, this review process is based on the number of imported goods from each importer according to the letter of credit from the 29 designated banks at the time. Currently, banks are in the midst of year-end settlements, so the number of letters of credit and importer data submitted to the Committee is quite small. Therefore, the review work cannot be actively promoted. It is hoped that the designated banks and relevant agencies will provide full cooperation, so that this review work can proceed smoothly in the short term.</p>
<h3>Importers Reduce Orders</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Sources familiar with the matter report that, due to the implementation of the import permit system, most of the orders placed in the United States by Chinese importers recently have been for small amounts of less than US$2,000, and large orders are rare. People in the import and export industry say that, based on the current situation, the goods coming from the United States this year will mainly be essential industrial raw materials, and the proportion of finished products will decrease. Regarding the issue of Japanese goods entering China, people in the industry believe that all Japanese industries have resumed production this year, and production has surged. Inexpensive daily necessities are bound to be imported into the markets of Southeast Asia and China in large quantities. Especially since there is a shortage of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in our country, prices are high, and it is difficult to request aid from the United States, it may be difficult to prevent the import of Japanese goods in the future. As for goods from the United Kingdom, the quantity is currently small, mainly due to the lack of materials in the United Kingdom. However, its large-scale export plan will also have an impact on our country in the future. It is also learned that ships coming to China after the U.S. seamen's strike is resolved will be arriving in an endless stream.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market became more bullish. The adjusted selling price of allocated yarn has been officially announced, with each piece of 20-count yarn increasing by more than 225,000 yuan compared to before, which greatly boosted morale. At the same time, the general factory numbers have also been settled, and no one is willing to sell. Therefore, 20-count yarn rose by another 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and 42-count yarn rose by 100,000 yuan. Customer demand has also increased. Shenxin No. 3 Factory once threw out more than 300 pieces of particularly good yarn, with the price opened at 2.3 million yuan, to be delivered on January 6. Both yarn numbers and customers can absorb it.</p>
<h3>Government Storage to Purchase Cotton Yarn, Starts Today</h3>
<p>The government's method of purchasing cotton yarn, which was established to stabilize yarn prices, will begin today, and will purchase 50 percent of the cotton yarn produced by yarn factories in the Shanghai urban area. This business is being handled by the Spinning and Management Committee designated by President Song and has begun to proceed with the purchase procedures and draft plans. The Committee held an internal meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the work plan for this year and discuss how to expand the organization and increase staff. The detailed rules for purchasing cotton yarn are still being drafted. In addition, all yarn factories in this city are closed today for New Year's Day, so the actual purchase date will begin tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Tea Intestine Exporters Hope for Subsidy Measures</h3>
<p>According to 据, the缠之不缠 after the war has made the operation of exported goods difficult, and it is not only our country that has been affected in this way among the countries of the world, there are many others. However, most of these countries have implemented a government-subsidized policy. A few months ago, the U.S. side needed a large number of maltose and ordered it from the Czech Republic. However, Czech businessmen calculated that the price on the domestic market would result in a loss of two-tenths per unit, so it could not be exported. Subsequently, the U.S. side inquired about purchasing from South America. The Czech government did not want to sit idly by and watch巨颇 foreign exchange will 数业, so it商 with businessmen. The government subsidized one and a half, the factory subsidized three-tenths, and the broker subsidized two-tenths to make up for the loss and complete the transaction. For example, the current request of Chinese tea exporters for the government to purchase is nothing more than a desire for government subsidies. In addition, the current sausage casing industry is also eagerly awaiting government subsidies to restore pre-war production levels, because the industry is affected by low international market prices. In order to reduce production costs, the purchase price of fresh pig intestines is suppressed and cannot be increased, resulting in a decrease in goods. It is said that the price of pig intestines originally rises and falls with the price of fresh meat. If the price of fresh meat rises again, the intestines will inevitably be sold to food households and no longer to intestine factories. At that time, the factory will completely stagnate. Therefore, people in the industry believe that government subsidies are a remedy policy for foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>The Only New Hope for the New Year: Implement the Constitution as Soon as Possible, Increase Education Funding, This Year's Central Education Funding Increases to Over 300 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, December 31st] Tomorrow is New Year's Day in the 36th year of the Republic of China. On the occasion of the end of the year, a new message in the field of education, that is, a good news: The increase in education funding in the national budget for the 36th year has brought great comfort to education workers. It is found that the recurring education expenses for the 35th year were 10.8 billion yuan, and will increase to 26.6 billion yuan in the 36th year. Temporary expenses (i.e., operating expenses) were 30 billion yuan in the 35th year, and will be 160 billion yuan in the 36th year, an increase of 250.2 billion yuan, an increase of about three times compared to the 35th year. The total national expenditure for the 36th year is approximately 932 billion yuan, so education funding only accounts for less than 4% of the total national expenditure, which is far from the provisions of Article 164 of the Constitution, which stipulates that "it shall not be less than 15% of the total budget at the central level, not less than 25% of the total budget at the provincial level, and not less than 35% of the total budget at the city and county level."

<h3>Excavation Record of Ancient Han and Jin Tombs on Niutoushan Mountain in Qingjiang</h3>
<p>— Lujiang, 24th of the month. Yimin</p>
<p>The appearance of the ancient tomb, in the Hongyang era, was regarded by the local villagers as an ancient kiln, and it became a safe haven for refuge. Only after a certain Huiyuan, an expert, conducted research, did it attract the attention of many archaeologists!</p>
<p>Cui Silang</p>
<p>A rubbing of an ancient tombstone (sent by Yimin)</p>
<p>After the news of the discovery of the Han and Jin ancient tombs spread [Central News Agency, Nanchang, Shen Bao, December 9, first edition news], many scholars who were concerned about antiquities and those with archaeological quirks were attracted to pay attention. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the reporter specially visited the discoverer Rao Huiyuan—Yizhen—Mr. In a carefully arranged room, he娓娓 (wěiwěi: patiently and thoroughly) told the story of the discovery of the ancient tomb. Mr. Rao is an artist who has taught at the Provincial Zhangshu Middle School for ten years. He graduated from Xinhua Art College in Shanghai in his early years. In addition to his superb accomplishments in Western art, he also has a strong interest in epigraphy and archaeology in his spare time. This discovery of the Han and Jin ancient tombs is indeed a valuable and worthy of reporting.</p>
<h3>Jin Bricks are Antiquities from the Ningkang Era</h3>
<p>He first talked about the detailed circumstances of the discovery of Jin bricks:</p>
<p>"The Jin bricks were discovered on Niutoushan Mountain. This place is 20 li away from Zhangshu and belongs to Qinhu Township in the county. The local villagers said that during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi years of the Qing Dynasty, due to mountain floods and rainwater erosion, the tomb chambers gradually collapsed and were exposed. When the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army passed through, the villagers, both old and young, regarded it as an ancient kiln and used it as a safe haven to avoid the war. In July of this year, Mr. Xu Yuanyu and I from the same county made a special trip to visit there. This is a location in a desolate wild mountain. Although the tomb chamber was exposed, it was overgrown with thorns and weeds blocked the path. The entrance of the cave was dark and gloomy, making people feel scared. We felt that since we had made a special trip to visit, we would inevitably be disappointed if we gained nothing. So, we summoned up our courage, pushed aside the weeds, crawled into the tomb chamber, and sure enough, we saw a tomb chamber shaped like a well, made of tomb bricks. The tomb was built with three layers of stone bricks, which were very solid. Due to the accumulation of mud, the height could not be seen clearly. The area of the tomb surface was probably about five or six feet. It was impossible to go any further. We groped and scrutinized the entrance of the tomb for a long time before crawling out!"</p>
<p>Mr. Rao spoke quickly and excitedly. Then, he took out a white cloth bag from a dark lacquer camphor wood cabinet. He took out two large celadon-glazed bricks, still covered with yellow earth. He explained with a smile:</p>
<p>"These are the two tomb bricks we picked up when we came back. The bricks are 36.3 cm long, 3.43 cm thick, 18.5 cm wide, and weigh 7.5 kg. The part without patterns is 6 cm thick. On the surface of the brick, there are eleven characters: 'Gui's tomb, Ningkang Second Year, Ninth Month, Fifth Day'. At the other end of the brick, there are also three characters: 'Gui's', and a cloud-shaped pattern."</p>
<p>Then, he expressed his opinions on his research: "Ningkang was the reign title of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin Dynasty, about 1,500 years ago, so I determined that it was undoubtedly a Jin tomb. However, who exactly was Gui? I checked the county annals, but there was no record. However, judging from the grandeur (more than two zhang long) and solidity of this structure, it can be determined that it was not an ordinary tomb. The simple and vigorous handwriting on the brick is also similar to Jin inscriptions. Moreover, judging from the completeness of many tomb enclosures that have been exposed on the surface nearby, its cloud-shaped and cloth-patterned patterns are not products of modern times. In addition, I also discovered several ancient bricks with the characters 'Chuping'. According to my research, they will be Han tombs from the Three Kingdoms period. However, due to various environmental constraints, if excavation is possible, there may be newer and more valuable discoveries."</p>
<p>His words seemed filled with regret. After I finished smoking a cigarette, I asked him about his discovery of Han tombs on Dagu Mountain. He said even more excitedly:</p>
<p>Patterns Very Similar to Han Basins: Brick Flowers of the Han Tomb</p>
<p>"In the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931), because enemy planes bombed the city indiscriminately, the Provincial Zhangzhong moved to Xiangxi. This is a large market town 15 li away from Zhangshu. It is a very famous place for Qingtang -. During my spare time after class, I would walk around the nearby wilderness and collect many patterned tomb bricks, quite similar to Jin bricks, but I didn't pay much attention to them at the time. This November, I returned to my hometown for business -Mr. —Mr. Yuan's hometown - and specially invited Mr. Chen Runyu and Mr. Yang Qiqin from the Cultural Middle School to Dagushan Mountain near the country. This place is twelve li away from Zhangshu, and there are many desolate tombs. We collected many tomb bricks, and their patterns are equally exquisite and vigorous, with double coins, cloud shapes, squares, diagonal lines, , fish shapes ... more than a dozen kinds. I researched epigraphy and fish-shaped patterns, and the Han wash on the surface of him is very similar. There are two types of this, one is rectangular and the other is conical. The length, width and thickness are slightly smaller than Jin bricks, but the brick quality is more delicate than Jin bricks. The collapsed soil surface of the tomb is the same as that of Niutoushan Mountain, and the bricks are scattered around. According to my speculation, the time of its unearthed also has one or two years of years.'</p>
<p>As he said this, he also took out a few bricks from another cloth bag, some with money patterns and some with fish patterns, but all were incomplete. Another more complete piece shows:</p>
<p>'Tomb of Cui Silang's wife, Nie Siniang'</p>
<p>The script is simple and ancient, and the characters "Cui" and "Si" are easily mistaken for the character "Jiu". He said: "Although these bricks do not have a reign title, judging from their script and patterns, it can be determined that they are from the same era as the Jin bricks discovered in Niutoushan Mountain. The script on the Cui's wife tomb brick has more Han and Jin calligraphy meaning, and the fish-shaped pattern is even more valuable. In the old days, the title of Lang was called Lang. I checked the Examination of Han and Wei People's Names -compiled by Zhang Zeji, Professor of the Department of Chinese Language and History of National Chung Cheng University- and it was most common in the Later Han Dynasty. From this, it can also be inferred that this tomb was around the Three Kingdoms period. When the nearby villagers pulled soil to bury tombs, they often pulled out many tomb bricks and pottery in the caves. Many shepherds also sometimes picked up ancient funerary objects in the mountains, and there is a myth circulating.</p>
<p>Two Golden Chickens on the Mountain, Legends Are Widely Circulated</p>
<p>The myth says: "There used to be two golden chickens on the mountain, which often came out to look for food. The villagers chased and captured them, but they were suddenly injured and disappeared." These are of course unreliable, but there are many ancient tombs hidden in the soil in Dagushan Mountain that have not been discovered, which is a true fact!"</p>
<p>Finally, he added:</p>
<p>"Qingjiang is an ancient name, a land of barbarians. It was not until the Southern Tang Dynasty that a county was established. Zhangshu borders the east bank of the Gan River and is the hometown of Tao Kan's mother in the Jin Dynasty—Zhangshu has the Huasuo Pavilion of Tao's mother—originally Xin'gan County, later renamed Qingjiang Town. Niutou and Dagu mountains happened to form a horn shape with Zhangshu Town. Before the county was established, it was a high mountain near the outskirts. Climbing high and looking far, you can see the plains and fertile fields, dense smoke, and a beautiful scenery and majestic atmosphere, so the brick patterns and words discovered twice are beautiful and simple. Here, we can also see the general examination and appreciation of patterns and art in the Middle Ages, and the meanings of the Ningkang brick and the Cui wife brick are similar and discovered together, so it can be determined that it is Han-Jin ancient objects are beyond doubt. If someone can excavate and sort them out as historical materials for future research, this is what I expect."</p>
<p>When I left the room, Mr. politely sent me a few rubbings of the ancient bricks, and said eagerly:</p>
<p>'If you are interested, I can guide you to during the winter vacation. 'Such a spirit and enthusiasm for research are moving. When the setting sun was approaching the distance, and the shadows of people were scattered, I easily concluded my archaeological and interesting visit.</p>

<h3>Museum of Inventions - Science and Education Exhibition - Random Notes on Visits</h3>
<p>— Paris, 18th Air Mail Dispatch - Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Paris, Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>Since Paris is the center of [whitespace] today, [whitespace] the science of cultural and educational [whitespace], the West [whitespace] Branch Station is in Paris. [whitespace] Paris will surely become the world's scientific center. [whitespace] Champs-Blyse [whitespace] demonstrates the science of an era [whitespace], including everything. [whitespace] Visitors stepped into it [whitespace]. It is like opening a history book of twenty-four dynasties, suddenly not knowing where to start. Now, let's try to focus on the main theme of science and culture. [whitespace] It also includes the projectors used for documents, books, and newspapers, as well as various [whitespace] instruments. [whitespace] This is indeed the latest tool of modern civilization. Checking the [whitespace] of the film, [whitespace] this country, by installing double lenses, can easily take two copies of the moving picture with Mr. White's rapid reduction machine Appareil Dehrie, which projects two electric lights Projecteurs with strong light, using the method of projecting moving pictures, placing two [whitespace] rolls of film, which are only three centimeters and a half, side by side, from left to right, [whitespace] quickly rolling, directly facing the documents or newspapers [whitespace] below, [whitespace] completed. At the beginning of each film, it should be like the subtitles of a moving picture. First, use a Pypewriter to mark the "title" on a [whitespace] surface of 12 cm long and 7 cm wide. [whitespace] The title attached below [whitespace] for the Ti [whitespace], separately [whitespace] aligned in a square box and facing the light of the "surface", [whitespace] an additional small [whitespace], taking advantage of a short moment in the middle, [whitespace] the film, this reduction machine's lens, projects directly downwards onto the document on the [whitespace] surface, and the distance depends on the size of the original. If the [whitespace] surface's [whitespace] is small, [whitespace] occupying a surface of 28 cm long, 8 cm [whitespace], 19 cm [whitespace], [whitespace] turn the machine button to make the aerial projection box extend downwards, then the lens will gradually move downwards and get closer, only 40 cm. The resulting reduced projection [whitespace] film, 36 cm long and 24 mm wide, is reduced by eight [whitespace] compared to the original. If the [whitespace] eastern surface is [whitespace] large, even as large as a surface 90 cm long and 60 cm wide, then [whitespace] turn the machine button to tighten the lens box upwards. At this time, the [whitespace] eastern surface of the lens can be as far as two meters. The resulting film, 36 cm long and 24 mm wide, is reduced by 25 times compared to the original. The picture shows Mr. White's projector produced by An re Dehrie Film Materials Store at 111 St. Maur Road, 10th arrondissement, Paris, [whitespace] a title plate and two [whitespace] projection lights' [whitespace] projection box. The straight ruler at the back marks six ratios of reduction: 8 times, 10 times, 12.5 times, 15 times, 20 times, and 25 times, which are clear at a glance. The entire machine weighs 90 kilograms, and the price of each unit is reportedly 330,000 French francs, equivalent to about one trillion Chinese currency. The special advantages of reduced projection films are: firstly, the objects are small [whitespace], making it extremely convenient for airmail to travel far [whitespace]; secondly, famous people's manuscripts or rare illustrated magazines, reduced to small rolls, do not need to take up much space, [whitespace] placed in a safe, can be preserved for thousands of years; thirdly, reprinting old books avoids [whitespace] errors and the burden of personnel. This method does not require proofreading, saves manpower, and allows people all over the world to easily browse rare and unique books. The facilities for viewing these films, as seen in France, are the "Shadow Character" reader Lecteur produced by Comaptoir o'Optique Industrielle, a lens industry merchant at 54 Rue Taithout, 9th arrondissement, Paris (" [whitespace] ", which is the abbreviation of the French [whitespace]). When [whitespace] a film is [whitespace] inserted into this device, [whitespace] the text is illuminated with electric light, passing through a [whitespace] square [whitespace] surface of 17.5 cm square, projecting onto a [whitespace] square mirror of 15 cm long and 20 cm wide, and reflecting the light onto the [whitespace] below, forming a light screen of 21 cm wide and 30 cm long (approximately one-eighth of the entire [Shen Bao] newspaper page). If the light is reflected onto the [whitespace] surface, there can be a light screen 60 cm wide and 90 cm long for clear viewing. At the same time, there are four types of readers for [whitespace] projecting text, seen [whitespace] in the country: first, transparent light Opti-bloc; second, video projector Visio-phot; third, video Vi il- oc; fourth, diaphragm Dlah [whitespace] (note: this word is an abbreviation of the French Dianhragme "diaphragm" and Document "document" combined). These are all unprecedented, and [whitespace] I will introduce them to the readers in the future. Although the Chinese section of the Science and Education Exhibition is not [whitespace], it [whitespace] attracts a lot of attention. Entering the [whitespace], [whitespace] it is dazzling, with red and green decorations, adding to the style of a Chinese palace. [whitespace] Displayed are enlarged covers of various Chinese magazines, and the Chinese science illustrated magazines displayed in the glass [whitespace] are recorded below as I saw them. (1) "Neptune" magazine, No. 23, Year 17. (2) Shaowu Entomological Society Weekly. (3) Journal of the Chinese Chemical Society. (4) Journal of the Chinese [whitespace] Society. (5) Science Times. (6) Democracy and Science. (7) [whitespace] Digest. (8) English Journal of the China [whitespace] Society. (9) Research Report of the Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (10) Construction Research. (11) Weather. (12) [whitespace] Enterprise. In addition, there are books such as Standard Manufacturing Methods, which are not [whitespace] listed. Among the Chinese science films shown at the exhibition, only "Solar Eclipse" produced by the College of Science of Jinling University was shown. Quality is valued over quantity. I recently learned from Dr. Zhao Yuanren, the chief representative of China attending the Science and Education Conference, that people from various countries had a particularly good impression of the Chinese film. In addition, there are excellent films from the United States and the United Kingdom, showing the ingenuity of famous mountains and rivers, promoting commerce and benefiting agriculture, and the operation of machines and power generation, which are difficult to describe in detail, with endless beauty.</p>
<h3>Higher Education in the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Shenyang, 25th Air Mail Dispatch - Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since the liberation of the Northeast, and the process of taking over education has been underway for eight months. Since there are problems with primary school teachers and funding, secondary education needs active reform, and higher education has aroused dissatisfaction among many people. In addition to the frequent difficulties faced by the provincial and municipal education authorities, Mr. [whitespace] Fang, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Education, is also greatly blamed.</p>
<p>Youths Love the Country</p>
<p>Primary and secondary education is managed by the provincial and municipal education departments, while higher education and several specialized schools are the responsibility of the Northeast Region Education Rehabilitation and Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education. The committee started working in April, taking over various colleges and universities, and accommodating and settling unemployed youths.</p>
<p>"The youths in the Northeast love the country. This is the first impression after coming outside the pass." "I have contacted many students and teachers under the age of twenty, and they all feel the same way. This shows the failure of the enemy and puppet education, and the success of our past education," Mr. Cheng Qibao of the education inspection team told reporters. Liang Huasheng, chairman of Jilin Province, also solemnly told reporters: "The youths in the Northeast are the most lovable and promising. Although they have received eight years of enslavement education from the enemy and puppets, they have not been enslaved at all!" How should we cherish this precious achievement and how should we carry it forward?</p>
<p>However, in the past six months, the youths in the Northeast have been restless in their studies. Although there are many political factors involved, the counseling agencies should bear a lot of responsibility. In the future, they should put more effort into educational facilities and leadership. They should not use means, but be sincere, honest, and impartial. Of course, the country's poverty is also the reason why many aspects cannot be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Now, let me introduce some of the situations of the counseling and rehabilitation of specialized schools and above in the Northeast, as published by the Northeast Region Education Rehabilitation and Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education at the press conference, to help everyone understand the current situation of higher education in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Preparation Work</p>
<p>There are many graduates from the former Manchukuo specialized schools and above in the Northeast region. Before the Soviet troops withdrew, students from Changchun, Shenyang, and other places rushed to enter the pass on their own. From February 26, 1946, to March 12, a total of 520 students arrived in Pingjin. The committee established the "Temporary Training Center for Northeast Youth Students" in Pingjin to manage and train them, and presented it to the Ministry of Education to establish the "Northeast Temporary University Refresher Class" to accommodate them. Chen Keshou was appointed as the director. At the end of April 1946, the Soviet troops in Shenyang withdrew, and the students who were going to Pingjin were moved back to Shenyang. The "Temporary University Refresher Class" was temporarily opened at this time, and students were gradually admitted in accordance with the examination and admission methods for graduates of former Manchukuo specialized schools and above. The total number of students in the school reached more than 3,000. After several months of refresher courses, the refresher results were considered good, and the school was closed at the end of September 1946. The students were assigned to various corresponding colleges and universities.</p>
<p>In April 1946, a large number of graduates from the former Manchukuo "National High Schools" (the abbreviated term for National Higher Schools, equivalent to the second grade of junior high school) were unable to pursue further studies. The committee established the National Northeast University Preparatory Class, appointing Fang Yong [whitespace] as the director, who was later replaced by Qu Shi [whitespace]. From June 1 to June 10, a total of more than 3,000 students entered the school. Since other former puppet [whitespace] National High School graduates successively [whitespace] arrived in various cities, intending to enroll immediately, the Northeast University Preparatory Class, limited by manpower and resources, could not accommodate more students. With the approval of the Ministry of Education, preparatory classes were established in Jinzhou and Yongji, so that the graduates of the Northeast National High Schools could all have a place to settle down and study. [whitespace] Shen Ming [whitespace] and [whitespace] Jingfang served as directors. The Jinzhou Preparatory Class officially opened on October 22, and the Yongji Preparatory Class officially opened on November 11.</p>
<p>The National Northeast University campus was taken over by Northeast University in April this year. Since the damage in various places was very serious, efforts were made to repair it. Over the past six months, most of the project has been completed. The faculty and students of the school, originally located in Santai, Sichuan, have now all arrived in Shenyang and have been settled. In addition to the original three colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce, the two colleges of Engineering and Agriculture have been restored, with a total of 22 departments and one specialized course. The school officially opened on December 25. However, due to the severe damage, all equipment needs to be added. Rehabilitation is almost equivalent to reconstruction. The Ministry of Education has been requested to restore the old appearance, so that it can become a strong highest institution of learning in the Northeast.</p>
<p>In order to improve the quality of teachers in the Northeast, the Ministry of Education specially established a teacher training institute in Shenyang, appointing Zhou Muwen as the director. It is specially designed to accommodate those who are currently or wish to serve as primary school teachers. Each term lasts for three months or six months. Since the beginning of May, the first class of students has graduated and has been assigned to various schools to serve. The second class of students has now entered the institute for classes and is expected to graduate at the beginning of 1947. The institute has added a sports and children's training class in the second term and has invited experts to teach.</p>

<h3>Severity of the Situation in Vietnam - Asia Still Unable to Achieve Peace</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>This week is the last week of 1946. There is peace and tranquility in the international arena, but in one corner of Asia, chaos persists. The situation in Vietnam is becoming more serious day by day, and the scope of the French-Vietnamese conflict is expanding day by day. It is no longer comparable to ordinary events, thus attracting close attention from countries around the world. Therefore, during this week, the world's attention is focused on Vietnam.</p>
<p>Close Attention from China, Britain, and the United States</p>
<p>The increasingly serious situation in Vietnam will not only endanger peace in one corner of the Far East but will also be sufficient to affect the development of the entire world situation. The three countries of China, Britain, and the United States have deep relationships. British Foreign Secretary Bevin is deeply concerned that the situation in Vietnam will affect Britain's interests in Southeast Asia and has invited British officials to a meeting to discuss the current situation in Vietnam. U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson also made a statement to the press, expressing the United States' concern about the Vietnam issue. As for China, because there are 435,800 overseas Chinese in Vietnam, any conflict between France and Vietnam will be sufficient to damage the lives and property of the overseas Chinese, so the Chinese government has to worry about these many overseas Chinese and take specific and effective policies to protect them.</p>
<p>Both France and Vietnam are Moving Towards Extremes</p>
<p>France's policy towards Vietnam has not changed its past practices. Although the Blum Cabinet is a progressive Socialist Cabinet, the measures taken this week are still a policy of suppression. (1) French military authorities, under the orders of the government, urgently transferred troops to Vietnam to reinforce their forces; (2) French aircraft participated in the war, bombing Viet Cong concentration points in the skies over Vietnam; (3) French Colonial Minister Moutet gave a speech in Saigon, firmly rejecting the Vietnamese people's demands for independence; (4) The French government blamed the conflict on the Vietnamese side.</p>
<p>As for Vietnam, because the people of the whole country have been stirred up by nationalism, they cannot abandon the national liberation movement halfway and will not stop until they have won independence. President Ho Chi Minh has demanded that French troops withdraw from all of Vietnam, and Kuomintang leader Nguyen Cong Toan has also advocated the organization of a "National Front Government" to deal with France to the end, and appealed to the United States and China to mediate, so the Vietnam issue will not be easily resolved for a while.</p>
<p>Blum Attempts Peace</p>
<p>If the worrying situation in Vietnam is allowed to develop naturally, it will cause very serious consequences. France's insistence on maintaining its prestige in Vietnam will also make it lose more than it gains, and may even cause political unrest at home, so Premier Blum had to send a telegram to President Ho Chi Minh, explaining that Colonial Minister Moutet's mission was to restore the situation in Vietnam based on the French-Vietnamese agreement. This is a peaceful attempt. It is heard that Ho Chi Minh will send a telegram expressing his agreement and asking the French military authorities to issue a ceasefire order.</p>
<p>As long as France can realize that the era of imperialism is over and no longer treats Vietnam as a colony, the peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue is not impossible.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Engagement of the British Princess and the Greek Prince</h3>
<p>The British heiress to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, is not engaged for one reason only, and that is that her father is concerned about the happiness of his beloved daughter.</p>
<p>Talks over tea after lunch at Buckingham Palace unanimously admit that Princess Elizabeth is deeply in love with Prince Philip of Greece. Well-informed people believe that if it were not for the opposition of King George VI, the engagement would have been announced long ago.</p>
<p>But people in London who can get accurate information insist that the King has never opposed his daughter's marriage for political reasons. According to people close to Buckingham Palace, Princess Elizabeth told her father about her love for the Greek prince, and the King, like any father in the world, advised his daughter not to get engaged immediately, saying, "Wait six months and then decide, and make sure of your heart."</p>
<p>According to people with reliable information, the King believes that although the Princess of Wales, Elizabeth, has the right to enjoy legitimate love like ordinary people, she does not have the freedom to change her mind at will like ordinary women.</p>
<h3>Random Records from the White House - Security is Not Very Tight - Many Steal Souvenirs</h3>
<p>Is it comfortable to sleep in a bed in the White House? Do guests steal things as souvenirs? And who is the most difficult guest to serve among all the guests to date? After Mrs. Nesbitt, who served as the chief housekeeper of the White House for a total of 13 years, wrote an article this year describing the U.S. President's residence, readers sent letters one after another, asking for answers to questions such as the above. The editors compiled all the questions and answers and selected the ones that received the most inquiries and published them in this month's magazine. Just like listening to many lectures where questions are allowed, the translator believes that the questions are more concise and detailed in nature than the descriptions and have a special flavor. I will select and translate several sections of the article as follows:</p>
<p>How Tight is Security at the White House?</p>
<p>Security there is certainly tighter than at your home or mine. For example, guests who come to play poker with the President, chat with Mrs. Truman, or woo Miss Margaret do not walk through the hallway and ring the doorbell on the front door. They have to stop at the White House gate and be questioned by the secret police before they can step into the corridor and be received by a very orderly attendant who guides them upstairs. However, once you walk through the first and second floors, which serve as offices and reception rooms for state guests, the atmosphere is typical of an American home and not strict at all.</p>
<p>Are the Beds in the White House Comfortable?</p>
<p>When I first tried to sleep in them, I thought they were very good, but the Roosevelt children, after a long period of research, said they were not good—the springs were too stiff and the mattresses were too hard. So I rearranged the mattresses. Since then, I have never heard anyone from the Roosevelt or Truman families, Democrats or Republicans, emperors or generals complain.</p>
<p>Do the White House Guests Love to Steal Things as Souvenirs?</p>
<p>I would say they certainly love to steal. The number of towels that went missing in the thirteen years I lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is simply impossible to estimate. Many cotton towels missing from the bathroom had to be replenished by me. In doing so, I deliberately omitted the abbreviated mark of the President's residence, so this part of the souvenir hunting was eventually prevented. But on one holiday when the White House was open to the public, we were shocked to learn that the large musk flower curtains in the "East Room" had been cut into small pieces by tourists. This is indeed a problem that has always made us uneasy.</p>
<p>Who is the Most Difficult Guest to Serve at the White House?</p>
<p>The person is Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The difficulty lies in the busy work of security. For example, when he is in the room, all servants are not allowed to stay on the same floor. Only after he goes downstairs are the servants allowed to return to their original work. Therefore, Molotov naturally made our work very difficult. However, in my humble opinion, these troubles are all unnecessary. Because in 1942, under the strict vigilance of the wartime protection personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, even a mouse could not run into the White House to threaten his safety.</p>
<p>How Much Do the White House Maids, Servants, Ushers, etc., Get Paid?</p>
<p>The number of salaries is quite staggering, ranging from $1,100 per year for maids to $1,600 per year for ushers. Personnel changes among them are very frequent because after working in the White House for two years, they can be transferred to the government to take on more leisurely work and receive higher salaries.</p>
<p>Who Started the Example of Employing All Black Staff?</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt. She felt that they worked very well and wanted them by her side. Mrs. Hoover used a mix of black and white staff. Mrs. Truman retained all of Mrs. Roosevelt's old staff and only added a Missouri cook. (Translated from the New York Times)</p>
<h3>To Avoid a Third World War - Women Who Nurture Men Must Participate in All Important International Justice</h3>
<p>Can the United Nations Organization bring lasting peace to mankind? Recently, a friend asked me this most serious question in the world, but I cannot give him an optimistic answer.</p>
<p>Everyone with a slightly clear mind will have the same idea. I fully agree with the goals of the United Nations Organization, but I am afraid that in its current organization method, will the chances of success be greater than those of the many peace organizations that preceded it? The crux does not lie in any errors in the concepts or goals, but rather that it has extremely serious weaknesses at its foundation.</p>
<p>In its current state, the United Nations Organization is an organization held by men and belonging entirely to men. After so much bloodstained history, now once again, politicians and power-worshiping politicians are trying to build a new world order without the help of women. This policy is truly pathetically unwise and shortsighted.</p>
<p>If the United Nations wants to move towards the road to success (and it must move towards the road to success), and if we want to avoid a third world war, we must let women who nurture men participate in all meetings.</p>
<h3>The United Nations is Like a Family - Needing Mutual Assistance Between Both Sexes</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that without the mutual cooperation between both sexes, the smallest unit of our society, the family, cannot be happy. I believe that the same is true. Except for an international organization that reflects the thoughts, feelings, and spiritual aspirations of women as much as men, what else can we expect from a family composed of nations to succeed.</p>
<p>All historical facts with definite evidence are sufficient to prove that my opinion is correct. Women are inherently different from men. Men live in the real world, so the most important goal is often the direct effect of their work. Women, however, have a powerful instinct that extends to the future. Because the life of the race continues from generation to generation through the physiological functions of women, they often yearn not only for their own children but also for the children's children to have a safe and beautiful living environment. Spiritually, men have never been able to think as far into the future as women. And only by considering the future can the United Nations sustain human civilization.</p>
<p>If women are allowed to participate, the instinctive sympathy is only one of their many extremely valuable contributions. Although two bloody and depressing wars have occurred in this generation, many men still seem to be nostalgic for war. This is a legacy they have inherited from countless generations of warrior ancestors. Women do not have this foolish feeling. What they have inherited from their ancestors is to heal wounds rather than create them. If there is a need for healing work in world affairs, then the degree of need is truly greater than ever today.</p>
<p>Most importantly, only women can make the people's belief in the United Nations as strong as their belief in religion. Men rely solely on reason and reasoning to survive; women live on their emotions. People of all nations must have a strong emotional confidence in their hearts, so that these many nations can intertwine into one family. To succeed, the United Nations Organization must become as sacred to us as churches, hometowns, and flags. Only women have the power to make it so sacred. (Translated from the New York Times)</p>

<h3>The White Man Has Lost His Superior Position in the Far East: Conclusions of a New York Times Reporter After Inspection</h3>
<p>— Translated by Lu Cheng from an article by New York Times reporter Lun Bu'er</p>
<p>The Rise of Nationalism in Asian Countries: White People Returning to Colonies Immediately Encounter Extremely Serious Difficulties</p>
<p>The Golden Age Has Become a Passing Cloud</p>
<p>The white man has lost "face" in the Far East. This is the conclusion the author has had to draw after traveling in China, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, and speaking with white residents in other Asian countries. Various isolated incidents and the new attitudes visible everywhere undeniably demonstrate that the power and prestige of the white man have greatly diminished.</p>
<p>This transformation can be seen in many ways. The arrogance of Chinese police and low-level officials is most obvious. It seems that the Chinese are retaliating for the grievances they suffered before the abolition of extraterritoriality. Almost every day, one or two arrogant incidents make the white man in Shanghai feel that he is now an inferior expatriate under Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>In the Philippine Islands, although there was a "honeymoon" period when the Japanese were first driven back, there is now a strong anti-American sentiment, openly expressed in Manila newspapers. Pedestrians in the Philippine streets display a self-importance never seen before. Is this a permanent transformation? Or is it just a reaction to certain military occupation policies or the misconduct of American soldiers? Perhaps no one can answer this question. However, the blows they inflict on Americans are indeed on the rise.</p>
<p>Everywhere in the Far East, the superior position that the white man once enjoyed as a representative of national power has now been lost, and perhaps forever.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned development of ethnic separation, there is also a political transformation, a resistance to Western rule. As a manifestation of this resistance, there are rebellions in some places. In the period after the Japanese surrender and before the Allied occupation, various nationalist parties in Asia rose together. The political consciousness among these people has advanced by a century in just a few years due to the good opportunities for national solidarity gained during and after the war. White people returning to colonies immediately find themselves encountering serious difficulties. The ideals they themselves have expressed, like the truly noble sentiments of the Atlantic Charter, are rebounding in their own faces. Colonial policies in any part of the world are now being tested.</p>
<p>But the dual transformation of the white man losing face and the resurgence of nationalism is even more pronounced in the Dutch East Indies than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Masters Become Partners</p>
<p>The Indonesians still call white people "Tuan"—master—, but now this "Tuan" is just a title. The golden age of the "Tuan" in the Dutch East Indies is over. What lies ahead is the "Bung" period. "Bung" means partner, a mutual term of address among Indonesians.</p>
<p>In the short time of the war, a vast sense of self and national identity has risen in the hearts of Indonesian youth. For the first time, they feel that they are also people. After centuries as colonial subjects, they are now citizens of their own country. Only the white people, who have always been masters, are now forced to take a lower position.</p>
<p>The Dutch say that this situation, which began with the war and the Japanese's lightning victory on these islands, was inevitable. The public degradation and insult of white people by their Eastern conquerors would leave an indelible impression on the hearts of the Indonesian people. Many Dutch people believe that the Allies' return with unparalleled power, sweeping away the brutal conquerors, as they did in the Philippines and elsewhere, did indeed restore a lot of hope for the white man. After the plan to reoccupy Java was shortened by the Japanese surrender, the Dutch felt that the recovery of these islands lacked many essential highlights. In fact, the recovery of these islands was indeed mishandled. The Japanese were left on the islands to rule for two months after the war ended. It was during this period that the Republic of Indonesia rose, and the rule of the "Tuan" became a thing of the past.</p>
<p>The Dutch can still comfort themselves by saying that the East Indies are still part of the Netherlands in any case. Because the Dutch royal family still sits atop the Dutch-Indonesian Union, which was established in the past two years. However, according to the agreement drafted here (Batavia), Indonesians will have the right to manage their own internal affairs. The Dutch now know that they no longer occupy this country, but are immigrants on the streets of their own construction. Although they can still retain private property, they must pay taxes to the Republic of Indonesia. They have been abruptly reduced from landlords to tenants.</p>

<h3>After Enduring Harsh Frosts and Scorching Suns, Gentle Spring Breezes Gradually Reach the Humble Cottage</h3>
<p>— Zi Xun</p>
<h3>New Year's New Hopes</h3>
<p>(In order of receipt)</p>
<p>My personal New Year's new hope for the year 36 is that the New Year after the year 37 will always be happier than the years before the year 37.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>My hope for the country is the realization of lasting peace. My hope for myself is that my life can be more disciplined, and that I can make the best use of my time. Sometimes I want to see the movies "A Song to Remember" and "Henry V", but I always miss the opportunity. There are also many art exhibitions and music performances, and I often don't have time to attend every one, which I deeply regret.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>My hope is that from this year on, everyone can live a good life in a peaceful and happy environment.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>I have no new hopes. For ten years, every year-end, I have had the same hopes for life, for the world, and for society. So I can only say that I have old hopes, not "new hopes".</p>
<p>I hope life is like a vibrant rose; the world a peaceful garden; society like a bright sun!</p>
<p>I hope the sun eliminates the pests and bacteria in the garden, and I hope the roses are always lush and always beautiful.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Qingge says I am "mentally unhealthy", which is true. So I have no hopes, only dreams.</p>
<p>For thirty or forty years, I have dreamed of feudal remnants devouring people, of fascist demons setting the world on fire, of corrupt officials drinking their cocktails, of gold bars, young ladies, and Mr. Fapi (Legal Tender) racing, of puppet show experts staging their masterpieces in Chinese theaters, of wailing everywhere with no one caring, of high-ranking officials and politicians issuing empty checks, and of the true gods, the goddesses of beauty, and the goddesses of peace weeping... Because I dream too much, it's too scary! It keeps me from falling asleep for a long time, and I wait for dawn with my eyes open!</p>
<p>Dawn has come! The painted scene is no different from the dream scene! I am tired of waiting and need to find a clean place to sleep forever, and I don't want to do anything.</p>
<p>If I must write a little hope, then I only have——</p>
<p>I hope that humans and the earth will become transparent crystals, so that I can take a closer look; or invent a pair of X-ray glasses, so that I can wear them and see what is hidden deeper than atoms in the earth, and the mysterious hearts of people!</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Positive new hopes existed last New Year; today, I dare not think like that. This year's hopes are only passively new:</p>
<p>That mediation will produce miracles, that the Communists and Nationalists will actually have peace, that the civil war will surely end, and that gunfire will be swept away.</p>
<p>That many treacherous officials will leave their posts, corruption will weaken its power, politicians will change their style, and that they will run around and shout, clenching their fists and rubbing their palms, all for "the people's democracy."</p>
<p>That factories will stop closing, businesses will avoid disaster, prices will not rise, and life will be more stable;</p>
<p>Then, there is hope for national recovery, and the people's strength will gradually rise!</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>It seems that the new hopes of the New Year are evidenced by a poem:</p>
<p>It's hard every year, but every year passes,</p>
<p>Every year is saddened by spring, but every year there is spring,</p>
<p>If you compare the New Year to everything,</p>
<p>You're always working hard to patch things up here and there.</p>
<p>I want to ride the wind and fly away,</p>
<p>But fame and fortune are tied to me!</p>
<p>How easy is it to get rid of them temporarily?</p>
<p>I can only accept my fate in this life.</p>
<p>"The old must go before the new can be hoped for,"</p>
<p>We must clearly understand our responsibilities,</p>
<p>Cut down and eliminate old ideas,</p>
<p>And usher in a new spring with all our efforts.</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>I hope that one day, people will live the same simple lives as we do, or that we can live the same comfortable lives as they do.</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>History will not and should not repeat itself. Let all the ugly and evil things in society become relics of history! I hope that from now on, everyone in the world can live a human life—at the very least, be able to eat their fill and keep warm; that everyone can have the opportunity and environment to develop their talents, and be able to speak freely and write freely; that the law can become the only fair measure of society, delivering justice to everyone's door; and I also hope that from now on, beautiful women will not have short lives, and Dong Shi will find a good husband; and I hope that heaven is on earth, and earth is also heaven!</p>
<p>Ten</p>
<p>I hope 1947 will be the most fulfilling year. First, I hope that the people of all countries will have happy days (materially and spiritually). I hope everyone smiles; I hope the sun shines in our hearts as it shines in the universe. I hope to continue to study China, understand China better, and love China more. I hope to respect "wisdom". May friends who love "truth" and "beauty" work together to worship and sing about humanity's progress towards "ideals." I also hope that the children of China and the children of France will work closely together to jointly determine the only goal: to promote human culture and enhance human dignity. (Narrated by Fa. Kuluote. Lu Xu; Translated by Xu Zhongnian)</p>
<p>Eleven</p>
<p>When I hear the word "hope," I can only force a bitter smile! The common people are not without hope, but until now, all hopes have been bubbles, so why mention them? If I must say a few good words on this first day of the New Year to bring good luck, then I might as well follow the custom and continue to indulge in wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Our country is called "The Republic of China." Whether in power or in opposition, all political parties, as well as social elites, are calling for "democracy," and under "democracy," they have added the words: "Only this one family, and no separate branches," much like "Lu Gao Lu, the originator of cooked meat cuisine," oh, how grand! Now, is it because the people are regarded as pigs, and so we would cook them? Not so! It is to give food to the people. Therefore, the first hope of the New Year: I hope the people have peaceful meals to eat and peaceful days to live.</p>
<p>For five thousand years, spanning hundreds of thousands of houses: Chinese culture is indeed the eldest brother among the cultures of the world. In the clan, the eldest brother is the head of the family: he has responsibilities, and also enjoys benefits. However, going one step further, our current culture has become a "culture of enjoyment," a culture that enjoys the cultures of others. How is this evident? Others invent this and that, and ship it to China for sale; we accept it wholesale and enjoy the benefits, so why bother racking our brains to research? People who talk about scholarship and research are the number one fools! Getting close to these people is harmful, and staying away from them will bring resentment; give them food, and they will argue seven hundred and twenty times, a thousand times! Therefore, the second hope of the New Year: I hope that intellectuals will all become "patriotic" merchants and sell more foreign goods.</p>
<p>As for myself, I never have great hopes. If I could "casually" become a mute, a deaf-mute, or have a heart of stone, then congratulations!</p>
<p>Humans live in hope; even in despair, there is hope. The new hopes of the New Year are not new to the author; as early as thirty years ago, every New Year, there was always an article of the New Year's first writing, to embellish the new scenery of the New Year. The memories of these thirty years are painful; however, we still cannot help but have hope. It is hope that enables humanity to continue its life.</p>
<p>The new hopes of the New Year, what are my hopes again? If I say I have no hope, there is hope after all. But after middle age, hope should not become a vain hope. My hope is very simple, it is to have peace. During the War of Resistance, no matter how adverse the circumstances, I fortunately enjoyed peace; because I had peace, I had no worries, so there was the so-called "broad heart and fat body." We should not underestimate ourselves, but we should not overvalue ourselves. Those engaged in cultural work have a magic weapon that is well known. "Avoid trouble and fear hearing of literary inquisitions, and write books to make a living." If there are new hopes for the New Year, mine are these: I hope that from now on, those engaged in cultural work can all have self-awareness, and that everyone can have peace.</p>
<h3>The Era of Sending a Boat</h3>
<p>— Wu Jingheng</p>
<p>"Sending a boat" was the name my maternal grandmother gave me when I was born in my mother's womb eighty-two years ago. The original text at the time was "Ji Zhou". Because I sought the hidden meaning from a Guan Yin oracle, it was "Guo Ju Burying His Son Heaven Bestowing Silver." My maternal grandmother thought that I was the reincarnation of the son who had not been buried, hoping that I would have a career, so she called me "Ji Zhou". Now, I have forgotten them, but the third floor of the Xie Cang Ming Ben Lou is just right. On April 25th, after leaving Chonglu for nine years, I flew back. On May 3rd, I went to Nanjing again to participate in the ceremony of returning the capital on the 5th, as Dong people called avoiding the war of resistance; on the 17th, I returned from Nanjing again. Lying in bed early, I felt that everything was not in order, how beautiful my things were! But once I stretch my legs and leave, I don't know how the objects will be scattered, and I laugh. Life is like sending a boat! Temporarily staying in this third floor, floating in the high sky, without a ship of Wu, the boat has eight rooms, where one can read, write, eat, drink, excrete, sit alone, or lie down in a daze when tired; old and tired, Yang is withered, and although there are beauties, I cannot build a bridge; lacking this point to compare with Qin Shihuang's Afang Palace, it is naturally inferior, but the boat can be controlled, and the palace is not what I want. I am sending this boat here, and I am sending myself to the boat. I wonder how long this will last? Asking this is either foolish or stupid. One day at a time, counting one day at a time is fine. Written on May 17th, the 35th year of the Republic of China, written on the wall of the Yuzhai on June 4th. (Published on New Year's Day of the following year)</p>
<h3>An Ideal Experiment</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>The Memory of Editing a Quarterly</p>
<p>I often think that if I have the opportunity to edit a publication myself, I must strictly adhere to the following rules:</p>
<p>First of all, break down sectarian prejudices. Prejudice is a narrow door, often keeping good things out. As long as it is created with an "artistic conscience," has real value, has historical significance, and has a sense of justice and a spirit of struggle, it is all welcome.</p>
<p>Secondly, don't ask if it is famous or unknown, just ask if the work is good. Works by famous writers can also be rough, and works by unknown writers can also be outstanding. However, one cannot lower standards and seek out works by unknown writers, just as one cannot let go and abuse the manuscripts of famous writers.</p>
<p>Publish less of your own things in your own publication and open up the space to others. Even if you publish your own articles, you must put them at the back to show some humility. Moreover, you don't necessarily have to print the editor's name in large letters! Of course, in certain necessary circumstances when you have to show your name, that is another matter.</p>
<p>Spend time reading manuscripts because the contributors have spent a lot of effort writing them, and they send them out with a "for sale" mentality, like sending out a hope. If the editor lets them accumulate without even looking at them, that's too unfair to the people and to yourself. New writers are all selected. When you discover something good, you will be so excited that you will jump up, as if heart and heart have connected, it is so happy. Even if the manuscript is not suitable, you should write your own opinions on it to convince the author, and not discourage them.</p>
<p>The style should be simple and generous, the proofreading should be serious, and every punctuation mark should be arranged in the most beautiful place. Pay manuscript fees on time and publish on schedule. …</p>
<p>This is my ideal, and I expressed it in a short essay entitled: "Introducing a Poetry Journal." Not long after the article was published, someone sent in a manuscript, thinking that I was really running such a publication. In fact, it was: "The land of ideals, there is no such garden, just imagining it to be so."</p>
<p>Last year (today, it can be said to be last year) in August, I edited the "Star River" and "Learning Poetry" weeklies for the "Overseas Chinese Daily". The former was a full edit, and the latter was an eighth. This gave me the opportunity to experiment with that ideal I had had for a long time. Although it was an unknown small newspaper, I did my best to edit it, and I asked friends from all sides to help write articles. There were always several submissions that came from the postman every day. Many seniors and friends from Chengdu, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Beiping, Tianjin, Guilin, Taiwan... have been constantly writing articles, and they are still piled up in my drawer without a chance to be published.</p>
<p>But the distance between ideal and reality is always so vast!</p>
<p>First, there are sometimes so many typos that it is impossible to see the sentences clearly, and even a "straw hat" is added to Mr. Cheng Shewo's head; manuscript fees, the first month was good, but after that, the time was dragged longer and longer. The list of manuscript fees for October has not yet been cashed. For me, this is a very heavy spiritual burden!</p>
<p>Because these supplements failed to make money for the newspaper, I received three "Orders" within five days: the first was to reduce the size and change them all to six columns; the second was: manuscript fees were reduced to three thousand to five thousand; the third was to cancel all supplements.</p>
<p>Looking back on these four and a half months of "experimentation", there was joy, there was guilt, and even more was indignation.</p>

<p>[K[&gt;P&gt;Ode to Garbage</p>
<p>— Wang Shanshan</p>
<p>Garbage, the cityscape of a big city, a symbol of the human world.</p>
<p>These piles, some are from the countryside, the roots of cabbages, the pods of green beans; some are from the ocean, the whiskers of lobsters, the scales of fresh fish; some are the dregs of delicacies from mountain villages, and some are the leftovers of food from watery countries. There are peels and pits of fruits from hot lands, perhaps once grasped by fair hands, and sucked by delicate mouths. There are also the corpses of ancient treasures, perhaps once appreciated by literati and elegant scholars; now they are only discarded on the roadside, left to be trampled on by pedestrians.</p>
<p>Here are torn silk stockings, and also the packaging of cosmetics; here are scarlet love letters, and also soiled account books; here are broken copper and scrap iron, and also fragmented manuscripts; there are various wine bottles, and also various medicine jars; there are baby's diapers, and also a girl's menstrual belt; there is the sputum of old people, and also the vomit of patients; there is the white hair of old women, and also the tears of sad people. There are fallen leaves, there are withered flowers, there is feces, and also English poetry, there is a lost diamond ring of a noble woman, and also the hidden weapons of a sharpshooter. …</p>
<p>Rainy days increase its moisture, and when it clears up, it spreads a strong fragrance.</p>
<p>The red is a patch of peach blossoms, the yellow is dazzling like gold, the green is like jade, and the bright is like crystal. During the day, pedestrians walk over it, and vehicles roll over it, but it does not hinder its brilliance and glory. At night, under the moonlight, a piece of fermented green sprouts light, like sparkling stars in the sky; also like looking down from high above on this sleepless city. Greedy mice come out to celebrate the newly discovered treasure, burrowing in and out, dancing and singing.</p>
<p>Flies are discussing with ants about organizing a joint-stock company; parasites are also planning to go it alone; although typhoid and cholera bacteria have received official appointment letters, they are still expressing humility in talks with journalists. Everything is stirring secretly, preparing for a big meeting to show off their skills.</p>
<p>Don't look at it as just a pile of dirt, it contains infinite beauty and mystery.</p>
<p>Caterpillars all turn into butterflies from here, toads eat swan meat from here, and even timid puppies can dare to take a risk here, hoping to get what they want.</p>
<p>Cats and dogs may occasionally have unfortunate conflicts with mice, even if it is a struggle, it is just like a human tragedy or comedy, what does it matter?——Dawn, everything returns to calm; quietly waiting to receive new stacking courses.</p>
<p>Remember, citizens of big cities, remember, you produce one and two-tenths of a pound every day you live here. Two thousand four hundred tons is the daily production of four million citizens. Every one of us citizens is an obligatory laborer for producing garbage, working for free to produce garbage.</p>
<p>In this day and age, everyone believes, "Economy first, work second," so in order to implement the principle of thrift, I would like to advocate preserving this urban cityscape. It saves money and trouble, it saves labor, and it saves brooms.</p>
<p>Pile it up, pile it up, pile it up as high as skyscrapers, pile it up as big as ancient pyramids, pile it up into mountains, pile it up into hills, pile it up into the cultural fortress of a metropolis.</p>
<p>However, the meddlesome cleaner finally shovels it, sweeps it, but what is shoveled away in a day is piled up again in a day; what is swept away in a year is another year; the garbage on the roadside has never been cleaned up! Just like the dregs of society, floating and sinking with the evolution of human history.</p>
<p>Pile it up, garbage! Pile it up, dregs! The cityscape of a big city, a symbol of the human world.</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>Ten years since leaving Shanghai, I returned east in the early summer of last year. Looking around the streets, the accumulated dirt had not been removed, a rather strange sight, so I created this article. Later, after several migrations, it was placed at the bottom of a box. In the blink of an eye, the New Year's holiday has arrived, and my writing is slow and dull, and I cannot write a timely article, so I have slightly altered this article and attached it to the filler, as a substitute for the New Year's gift of a returning guest, which I believe will not be without the meaning of getting rid of the old, and the reader will not think it is an insult.</p>
<h3>Founding of the Republic and Presidential Inauguration</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>The first day of the first year of the Republic of China marked a new era in the thousands-year history of group and political system reform in China. It was also a turning point in the evolution of our national system. At the same time, a quarter of the world's population transitioned from the autocratic, oppressive politics of a monarchy to a democratic republic. The significance is extremely profound. That day was the day the Founding Father took office as the first popularly elected President of China. Counting back, it has been thirty-six years.</p>
<p>This major turning point in Chinese history was certainly the result of eighteen years of organization and continuous action by the revolutionaries. As circumstances matured, more than ten provinces successively revolted within a little over a month after the Wuchang Uprising. A central government was organized to comprehensively manage the unified administrative structure, which was of utmost importance both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Initially, Cheng Dequan, the governor of Jiangsu, and Tang Shouqian, the governor of Zhejiang, jointly telegraphed Chen Qimei, the governor of the Shanghai army, proposing that representatives from each province be publicly elected to convene in Shanghai. This was to emulate the system of the thirteen-state conference in the United States, to ensure consistent action across the twenty-two provinces of the country. After two or three meetings, the representatives elected Huang Xing as Grand Marshal and Li Yuanhong as Deputy Grand Marshal, drafting the powers of the Grand Marshal to preside over the Provisional Government of the Republic of China. However, the representatives of the provinces in Wuchang expressed their disagreement, and Huang resigned as a result. The provincial representatives re-elected Li Yuanhong as Grand Marshal and Huang Xing as Deputy. However, Li could not go to Nanjing, and Huang also strongly declined, stating that he would wait for the Founding Father to return to the country. As a result, neither Huang nor Li took office.</p>
<p>After completing his diplomatic activities in various European countries, the Founding Father safely arrived in Shanghai on November 6th. The revolutionary atmosphere and the nation's focus, and the selection of a leader, entered a new stage.</p>
<p>The day after the Founding Father arrived in Shanghai, many of the League's leading members held a public banquet in Aili Garden and discussed the formation of a government. Huang Xing, Chen Qimei, and Song Jiaoren secretly discussed recommending the Founding Father as President. They then signaled this to the representatives of the provinces, based on the fact that the Founding Father had led the revolution for eighteen years (since the founding of the Revive China Society), and his hard work and great achievements made him the most suitable candidate. Ma Junwu also published an essay in the Minli Bao, calling the attention of people inside and outside the party. In the evening, at the Founding Father's residence, they discussed the government organization plan. Song Jiaoren emphasized a cabinet system. Based on the facts at the time, the Founding Father strongly opposed this. Huang Xing persuaded Song to withdraw his proposal, but Song was unwilling. The next day, Huang went to the Nanjing Representative Assembly and proposed three motions: first, to adopt the Gregorian calendar; second, to use the Yellow Emperor's reign as the epoch for the uprising, which should now be changed to the Republic of China epoch; and third, the government organization should adopt a presidential system. The results were completely approved.</p>
<p>On the tenth day of November, the provincial representatives held a provisional presidential election assembly in Nanjing. Representatives from Hebei, Fengtian, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Qin, Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, totaling forty-five people, attended. It was stipulated that each province would cast one anonymous ballot. Zhejiang representative Tang Erhe chaired the meeting. The results of the vote count were: Sun Wen received sixteen votes, Huang Xing received one vote, totaling seventeen votes. When the voting was about to take place, Hunan representative Tan Renfeng secretly said to Ju Zheng: "You are a representative of Hubei, you should elect Li Yuanhong as President!" However, Li did not receive a single vote, which shows the psychology of the representatives at the time.</p>
<p>After the Founding Father was elected, the representative assembly specially dispatched Wang Chonghui, Chen Tao Yi, and others to bring the certificate to Shanghai to welcome the President to enter Nanjing to take office. The Founding Father instructed Chen Qimei: "We revolutionaries should eliminate all bad habits and not adopt any rituals. Just prepare one passenger car, that will be enough." Chen followed the order and notified the railway bureau to handle it. On the third day of November, at eight o'clock in the morning, the car departed from the Shanghai North Station. At five o'clock in the afternoon, the car arrived at Xiaguan, and a ceremonial salute was fired, accompanied by military music. On that day, the Shanghai-Ningbo and Nanjing-Shanghai railways were connected, and he continued to take the train into the city. Although the wind was biting, the enthusiasm of all sectors to welcome the President did not diminish in the slightest.</p>
<p>When the Founding Father arrived at the station in the car, soldiers guarded all around, and idlers were not allowed to board. Shortly after, the Founding Father got off the train, holding an ordinary military cap in his hand, and wearing a khaki-colored military uniform, without wearing epaulets or gold belts. After leaving the station, he rode in a blue silk-decorated carriage, with military music and cavalry leading the way, followed by guards, directly to the Presidential Palace (the former Liangjiang Governor-General's Office).</p>
<p>After resting briefly, the provincial representatives gathered and reported the election process, requesting him to take office immediately. At ten o'clock that night, the Founding Father performed the inauguration ceremony.</p>
<p>It was announced that this day would be January 1st of the first year of the Republic of China. The next day, the representative assembly resolved to add the election of a Vice President, and Li Yuanhong was elected for the time being. Following this, the cabinet was organized and submitted to the representative assembly for approval. Following the American system, there was no Premier. From then on, the newly established central government comprehensively managed everything both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, of course, there are unlimited feelings. However, over the past thirty years, there have been many changes in the country and its people. The responsibility for future revitalization and nation-building lies with the heroes of the country. They must eliminate private opinions, work together, and build a Three Principles of the People country, so as not to fail the lofty and ambitious goals of the pioneers who created the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Ode to New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The rising national flag brings the new year—the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the thirty-sixth year, New Year's Day. The so-called "Yuan" refers to the beginning of the year, the beginning of the day, the beginning of the hour. The revelation of "Yuan" is a new expression, so New Year's Day is worthy of praise. However, in the past, people used the monarch to represent the country. On this day, "the officials offer congratulations of ten thousand autumns and long life," and the edict states "the joy of starting anew." Inferiors only know to congratulate themselves on their wealth and status. After all, there are few people who, like Yuan Weizhi, utter the ironic words "What is achieved by wishing for wealth and status? Intelligence is used to make things more difficult." People today certainly take the country as a prerequisite, but under the sound of "Long live the Republic of China," everyone exchanges the phrase "Congratulations" when they meet, focusing on their own concepts. Yuan Weizhi is a sinner!</p>
<p>The calendar on the desk has been changed thirty-six times. Although it is not as long as the Gregorian calendar, which is one thousand nine hundred and forty-seven years old, our national calendar has reached this number, which is quite remarkable. In the past, the fate of the "calendar" shifted with the feudal circle. Before Emperor Wu of Han, even New Year's Day was not fixed. According to the transmitted calendar calculations, the Yellow Emperor and the Yin and Zhou dynasties established Zi as the correct month, taking the eleventh month as the first month. The Qin dynasty established Hai as the correct month, taking the twelfth month as the first month. It was not until the seventh year of Emperor Wu's Yuanding reign that it was corrected, and this calendar was used for thousands of years, called the "ancient calendar," which was the Taichu calendar from an even earlier period than the Yellow Emperor, establishing Yin as the correct month. Gu Qiong and Xia Yu also did the same, so it is also called the "Xia calendar." Of course, it has become a past term in the present era. However, some people call the Xia calendar the "agricultural calendar," which is very appropriate. It specifies when "Grain Rain" is, when "Grain in Ear" is, and from the Beginning of Spring to the Beginning of Winter. Doesn't the current national calendar also use these seasonal markers on the side? Kicking out from the feudal circle, preserving the good and discarding the dross, thus laying the foundation for the long-term fate of the national calendar. On this day, we offer ten thousand autumns and long life, praising the continuation of the Republic of China, especially the second New Year's Day of the revival. We should accept this "joy of starting anew"!</p>
<p>However, a year has passed since the victory. Only by being able to "think about the past" can we talk about "looking to the future." Let us review the past year. How were we on this day last year? We had just recovered the heavenly voice and majesty of the great Han from the external disaster of "Huaxia." There was a chorus of voices calling for rehabilitation and restoration. However, the phenomenon of rehabilitation was unbearable to witness, and restoration naturally could not catch up to the original state. The most painful thing was that the lives of ordinary people were still suffocated in the struggle under high pressure, and the flames of domestic war had once again spread across every inch of land stained with blood and stench. A year has passed in a hurry. But we will not be pessimistic, because we have fully experienced the lessons of extreme hardship and striving for light in the past eight years. In the past year, in the "reversal after extreme stripping," we will bear the remaining pain ourselves, and the constitution was completed this year and promulgated today. By the end of the year, the constitution will be implemented. We must look at the year ahead. This year is no ordinary year.</p>
<p>The thirty-sixth year is no ordinary year. Yes, the number "thirty-six" tells us that it is a good symbol. From the perspective of "six," it is the Yin number in the Book of Changes, and six sixes make Kun. The image of Kun is the earth, and the commentary says, "To carry out the Kun Yuan, all things are born." It can be said that six is as vast and thick as the earth, so there are six relatives in human relations, six emotions in character, and six virtues in education. And six sixes are thirty-six, which is reminiscent of Qin Shi Huang's division of the world into thirty-six commanderies, and the Han dynasty's subjugation of the thirty-six kingdoms in the Western Regions, which is a phenomenon of far-reaching power. We hope that from the court to the countryside, we must firmly grasp this extraordinary year, and how to "be honest and establish integrity." On this New Year's Day, we cannot be sinners like Yuan Weizhi, and we must jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of nation-building. Then, when the government is returned to the people, the people can recover from the high pressure of life and return to the spring terrace of peace and happiness, and my Ode to New Year's Day will not become a "hopeful saying at the Pillar."</p>
<h3>Two Steps Backward and Three Steps Forward for Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Hong Shen</p>
<p>Over the past year, the crisis in spoken drama has been growing, and the situation is indeed very serious. The main manifestations are the scarcity of playwriting and the difficulties encountered in professional performance.</p>
<p>The eight years of the War of Resistance were the golden age of spoken drama. From major cities to remote rural areas, the footprints of spoken drama troupes could be found everywhere. There is no doubt that spoken drama played a great role in publicizing the War of Resistance and promoting popular morale. The prevalence of military drama reflects how spoken drama served the War of Resistance and existed as an important tool for political education. According to preliminary statistics from the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, there were no fewer than 50,000 professional spoken drama practitioners nationwide, and the number of amateur practitioners was often several times that number, which shows the vigorous scene of the spoken drama movement at that time.</p>
<p>In Shanghai during the "Isolated Island" period, it is said that there were more than a dozen spoken drama theaters, and nine out of ten shows were full, which could rival the interior. Combining the playwriting in the interior and the occupied areas during this period, whether in quantity or quality, it was a rare harvest since the New Culture Movement in China.</p>
<p>Over the past year, it can be said that there have been very few playwriting. As far as what has already been staged is concerned, it seems that there is only "The Ghost Catcher." However, a year ago in Chongqing, I already heard the author Wu Zuguang talk about the concept of this play, but it was only recently completed. There are also two new works: "Grievances of Mountains and Rivers" (published in installments in "Literary Renaissance") and "Ode to Peace" (published daily in Wenhui Bao), both recent works by Li Jianwu, but the full picture has not yet been seen. In terms of quantity, it is really scarce enough.</p>
<p>Why is it so difficult to produce plays? The first is the instability of life. Today, cultural workers are really in a situation of "not even having time to save themselves." "Writing books for the sake of rice and millet" can be considered a peaceful and prosperous event. At present, even this point is close to fantasy for literary writers. Writing plays is subject to various technical limitations, which takes more effort than other creations. Who is willing to give up the easy for the difficult, to win an unreliable need for a few liters of rice? Moreover, even if you write it, unless you are a well-known writer, otherwise the bookstore is unwilling to print your things. Because物价涨了，成本高昂, 普通人没有钱买书来看，有钱的人又不大看书. Even if it is printed, the opportunity to stage it is also slim. Secondly, in order to be busy arranging for basic needs, or trapped in the chores of sweeping and cooking, writers have no way and no mood to write. If they reluctantly write, the environment prevents them from speaking freely. These things directly and indirectly wear down the playwright's will to create, forming the phenomenon of playwriting stagnation.</p>
<p>The number of spoken drama theaters in Shanghai has suddenly decreased from more than a dozen during the War of Resistance to five at the beginning of this year, and to only two at present, and the business is not very good, struggling hard.</p>
<p>The most serious problem in professional spoken drama performance is the decrease in basic audiences. Of course, part of the reason is due to the dumping of Hollywood films; however, the bigger reason is probably that the burden of ticket prices, including taxes, is too heavy. The basic audiences for spoken drama are civil servants, students, and young professionals, and these people are all victims of currency inflation. Although they love spoken drama very much, they cannot afford it. Just look at the box office situation when the Shanghai Theater staged "Heroes of the Grassland." Selling at full price, the business was extremely miserable. Selling at half price, it was full—as a result, selling at half price, the theater's income actually increased a lot. Why can't the ticket price be reduced to suit the spending power of the audience that supports spoken drama?</p>
<p>The soaring cost of performance is also a big problem. At present, no professional spoken drama troupe has its own theater and has to pay extremely high rent. Some are "profit sharing" and some are "bottom guarantee." For example, the "Shanghai Drama and Art Society" is "bottom guarantee." If business is bad today, they have to pay out of their own pockets to make up for the front desk. At the same time, due to the increase in performance costs, they have to resort to usury, which is a quagmire that can put any business in a desperate situation, unable to extricate itself.</p>
<p>Due to the above difficulties, the theater authorities have to try their best to save on performance costs. As a result of the savings, the installations are often simple and crude, and they are not willing to purchase more props and costumes, and the rehearsal is also careless. As a result, the standard of spoken drama performance has declined. Due to the decline in the standard of performance, the few remaining audiences gradually become more disappointed, and the business is even worse. Therefore, the theater authorities again focus on reducing performance costs, and the business is even worse. The two factors interact with each other, pushing the spoken drama business downhill.</p>
<p>This is the case in Shanghai, and it is said to be the same in other cities.</p>
<p>The audience wants to reflect reality, but spoken drama cannot meet their requirements. Why? In some areas, the multiple inspection system of play script censorship and performance censorship still exists; therefore, a play with practical significance, after several "revisions," has its realistic components reduced, and cannot meet audience requirements, thus affecting attendance.</p>
<p>Finally, undeniably, today's spoken drama performance has departed from the excellent traditions of the past. It is true that from amateur to professional, the regularization and careerization of drama work is not a bad thing in itself. However, the mentality of market merchants has infiltrated the spoken drama world. The spirit of open administration and open economy in the past has been lost. Those who are responsible for administration and economy are often separated from the actors and other workers, and the latter become a simple employee. To some extent, everyone no longer pursues the common artistic goals or engages in an ideal reality. We know that no matter what group, if the measures of economy, administration, and personnel cannot be reasonable, it will inevitably affect the development and existence of the business.</p>
<p>The past year can be said to be a year of two steps backward for spoken drama. Spoken drama may encounter greater difficulties, and our staunch warriors of the spoken drama movement should strive to overcome these difficulties and weaknesses and take three steps forward in 1947. ——35, 12, 24——</p>
<p>Appendix: Letter from the author of this article</p>
<p>Mr. Jin:</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter asking me to write a "Spring and Autumn" special feature for New Year's Day, and stipulating the topic as "Spoken Drama in the Past Year." I have made an effort to write a short article. Because I have recently developed a stomach illness, it was recorded by the secretary. I am sending it to you for your review and to determine whether it can be used. I am afraid that the original title is used by many people, so changing the topic may be more novel, please also consider. I wish you peace.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Hong Shen Qi 35, December 25th.</p>

<p>Free Talk Congratulations on the New Year</p>
<h3>The Beginning of the Year</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The beginning of a new year, everything is renewed. Looking forward to the future, everyone has their own hopes and brightness, and recalling the past, one cannot help but be filled with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Although the past year was the first year of victory after the War of Resistance, whether from the perspective of the country or the individual, it was a continuation of suffering, which was very different from the post-victory scene we had imagined during the War of Resistance. In fact, this is not surprising. We were originally a weak and poor country, and once we suffered this mutual comfort, and continued to fight hard for eight years, all the new wounds can be said to be deeply and painfully mutual. How can we fully restore the old appearance and move forward in a short time? It is inevitable that we are not satisfied, but each of us has a responsibility. This responsibility is that we have not worked hard enough, or even have not worked hard at all, and even hinder the efforts of others!</p>
<p>However, in this year of continued suffering, we convened the National Assembly and completed a fundamental law of the country. This achievement is brilliant, and perhaps only this achievement can be used to account for the expenses of the past year.</p>
<p>How about this year? Hope is indispensable, but it does not have to be too extravagant. In all aspects, there will certainly be progress; but each of us must appeal to our own conscience. Does my work, my career, my life behavior, in addition to benefiting myself, benefit others? Does it cause harm to others?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new year, I would like to share this with you!</p>
<h3>Everywhere is Dry Labor in a Gobi Desert, The New Year's Wine is Not Fragrant</h3>
<p>— Zikai</p>
<p>Fable</p>
<h3>The Changing of the Guard—Rooster, Dog, Pig</h3>
<p>— Sui</p>
<p>On the eve of the thirty-fifth year, amidst the sound of gongs and drums and firecrackers, the Dog Star wore a tattered "Bingxu" style coat, with a dejected spirit, and its tail clamped tightly in its buttocks.</p>
<p>It was about to go to the Pig Star to complete the handover formalities. As soon as it left the gate, there was a chorus of "Boo" sounds around it. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that they were some employees who had just closed shop from the store or factory: "Another noisy year-end bonus issue!" The Dog Star was filled with resentment. Thinking that it was about to be handed over, why bother to suffer for others? It shrank its head into the collar of its coat, took three steps in two steps, and hurried away from the door, thinking as it walked, when the Rooster Star and itself completed the handover at this time last year, it had said: "It may not be perfect, but I seek to be clear of my conscience." Although this year people have given more criticism than praise, I have done my best, running around, and I have no guilt when I search my heart. Since I have no guilt, then "let them boo, I have been a good official!"</p>
<p>The Dog Star was happy, and its tail straightened up. At this moment, a group of sneaky guys came to greet them. They bowed and smiled, standing respectfully on the roadside. The Dog Star recognized that they were some traitors who had been hiding for nearly a year. Now that the reporting deadline was over, they were going to swagger out to profit and show off again. It could not help but snort: "It's cheap for you bunch of thieves!"</p>
<p>The Dog Star has the habit of arrogant officials, and it cannot stand people's flattery. Its arrogance arises spontaneously, so it again raises its head and strides forward, the resentment of some mockery it just received is forgotten cleanly.</p>
<p>Crossing two streets, many store doors are pasted with notices of "Declaration of Liquidation." The Dog Star felt two chills in its heart; walking past the distribution center, on the side of the road that was crowded like a long dragon during the day, several beggars were huddled up, desolate and bleak. The Dog Star shook its head and sighed.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Pig Star's house, the old Pig was swallowing clouds and puffing out smoke on the bed. The Dog Star was shocked, took out two handover registers from its side, and pointed solemnly and rigorously at a line of work outlines of "××× will be executed from New Year's Day," saying:</p>
<p>"People say you are confused and angry, why don't you take care of yourself?"</p>
<p>"What?" the Pig Star said lazily.</p>
<p>"×× is the first major event after you took office? You are personally demonstrating and breaking the law!"</p>
<p>"You are making a mountain out of a molehill! I am precisely because I am going to lead everyone to ×× from next year, so I take advantage of the last day of this year to ×× happily. You see me as confused, from tomorrow I will also vigorously change my ways and start anew!"</p>
<p>"New person..." The Dog Star raised its tail. Facing the energetic old Pig, it handed over several thick registers.</p>
<p>Although the room was smoky, seeing the new "Dinghai" style robe on the old Pig, it was radiant and dazzling, as if there was unlimited new weather. The Dog Star smiled happily and easily.</p>

<h3>Congratulations on Getting Rich</h3>
<p>— Hong Guo</p>
<p>In previous years, everyone said "Congratulations but not getting rich." This year, we cannot but hope to get rich! Because everyone has been poor enough in the past year, "big and small, faces without color!"</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new year, everything is starting anew. We, as ordinary people, force a smile and struggle through the new year, only hoping that weapons of war will be transformed into money, and guns and ammunition will be transformed into production machines. Transportation should be restored as soon as possible, and factories should resume work as soon as possible. In a thousand words and ten thousand sentences, the root is one sentence: "Harmony brings wealth!"</p>
<p>New Year's Day is the beginning of writing, everything is auspicious, congratulations on peace, congratulations on getting rich!</p>
<h3>New Year's Customs Are Strange and Bizarre</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>The Doukhobor folk dance of Canada</p>
<p>Every New Year's Day, they must put an empty chair in the house, treating it as if a distinguished guest is sitting on it, serving it diligently, and even serving it dishes.</p>
<p>The Doukhobor people firmly believe that unexpected guests are from heaven. If a strange guest comes uninvited on New Year's Day, they consider it an unparalleled honor, and that guest will bring a year of happiness. Even if no strange guest comes, they still have to "act as if there is something" to see the guest off, but the door cannot be opened, lest "the God of Fortune slips away quietly!"</p>
<p>On festivals, the people of Tibet, as usual, greatly invite their guests, and have performances of "Ten Thousand Dances," "Flying Gods," and other unique Tibetan skills. People from all over come from thousands of miles away to see the Living Buddha, holding gold and jewels on their heads and kneeling to offer them. If the Living Buddha accepts, he will use a whisk to brush their heads, and this believer will be overjoyed. All women must smear red sugar on their faces when they see the Living Buddha, otherwise it is considered "presenting beauty to confuse and disgust people," a great and unpardonable sin.</p>
<p>The Muslim New Year is the most boring. Originally, from the morning of every New Year's Eve, all men and women over the age of ten were "hungry," not allowed to eat or drink, not even allowed to swallow saliva. This is how he was hungry for a year - until the New Year's Day of the following year.</p>
<p>The "Yuchi" Indians in the United States are particularly comical. Every New Year's Day, they have to drink the bitter juice made from the roots of the ball snake flower grass. Drinking that bitter juice will definitely make people sick, but they have to drink it. Drinking it makes them sick, and after they get better, they drink it again, and drinking it makes them sick again... They drink it seven times in a row, and get sick seven times, before it is considered "meritorious and complete."</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, in the village squares of the "Yuchi" Indians, the natives line up in long rows, waiting to drink the bitter juice. If they get sick, they go to the side of the pit, and there is also a long row lying on the side of the pit.</p>
<p>It is said that they believe that drinking the bitter juice and getting sick will cleanse the body, then "the Sun" will like them, and the crops will certainly be abundant in the year.</p>
<h3>From the Plane Crash in the Fog: Talking About Kongming's Arrow Borrowing in Heavy Fog</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>The heavens have unpredictable winds and clouds, leading to three aircraft accidents. The saying that "man can definitely conquer nature" cannot be fully believed today!</p>
<p>Speaking of this "unpredictability," it's the "dense fog filling the sky"!</p>
<p>Speaking of "fog," we are reminded of Zhuge Kongming of the Three Kingdoms period, who borrowed 100,000 arrows from Cao Cao in one night of heavy fog.</p>
<p>Zhuge Kongming's arrow borrowing was also due to his familiarity with "astronomy." In Zhou Yu's camp, he knew that there would definitely be "heavy fog" three days later, so he boldly wrote a "military pledge." Zhuge Kongming's "familiarity with astronomy" allowed him to carry out this "farce" with his life. He was indeed "in charge of timing"! Research shows that the time of the arrow borrowing was just a few days after the winter solstice.</p>
<p>Now, the plane crash occurred three days after the winter solstice. The winter solstice is the birth of yang, and there must be "heavy fog" in the weather transition. Kongming borrowing arrows is one example, and Kongming "borrowing the east wind" to burn the Red Cliffs is precisely a natural change in the weather. The ancients had already understood these "mysteries," but today, when science is said to be advancing day by day, we are falling short in this regard, not paying attention to "the birth of yang at the winter solstice" and the changes in the timing of the heavens. It's somewhat felt that "modern people are not as good as the ancients"!</p>
<p>From this, it can be known that ancient China may not have lacked astronomy science academies, but everyone regarded them as "secret manuals," unwilling to pass them on to later generations, being selfish and unwilling to conduct public research, which led to good theories and no successors, which is indeed a regrettable thing!</p>
<p>Intelligence Test</p>
<h3>Why Suspected?</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Professor Howard Dunne said: "Gollay was an obstinate and taciturn old man, but I liked him very much. After he was murdered last December, I decided to investigate the case. Browning, the last guest to visit him in his life, should of course offer some explanation for this visit."</p>
<p>"Browning said: 'I told the people at the hotel I trusted where I was going (in case something happened, the address and phone number where I could be found), and around five o'clock I arrived at Gollay's suburban residence. I saw him sitting at a long table in the study in the dim twilight. He waved for me to sit in a separate chair and invited me to dine with him at eight o'clock in the evening. After sitting down, I reached for a cigarette, but I remembered that Gollay disliked cigarettes, so I put the cigarette down.'"</p>
<p>"'In our discussion, his main contribution was to nod in agreement, or to roar, or to use the single word "yes" or "no" to express everything. Mr. Gollay was unwilling to waste words.'"</p>
<p>"'Around seven o'clock, the phone rang, and he asked me to answer it. It was my wife, asking me to return immediately to meet a guest. After finishing the call, I returned to my chair, and I told him about the phone call, and Gollay nodded in agreement that I should return immediately.'"</p>
<p>"'On the way out, because the lights were not on, I bumped my head, which explains why I have a wound on my head. Just as I was approaching the door, he called out to me from behind, saying—"See you again tomorrow morning at ten o'clock!" When I left him around a little after seven o'clock, he was still alive and well!'"</p>
<p>Professor Howard Dunne continued: "Although Browning's phone call proved to be genuine, before he finished speaking, I knew that he was involved in the murder case!"</p>
<p>Clever readers, why is Browning a suspect?</p>
<p>The answer will be revealed in four days.</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 23</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Catching Poisonous Snakes</p>
<p>Among the hard-core beggar gangs, the snake beggar profession is the most promising. Because they are specialized technicians in the jianghu, they cannot survive without real talent and skill. Because poisonous snakes cause people to turn pale at the mention of them, and no one wants to anger them. But the more poisonous the snake, the greater the profit. As long as the snake venom is overcome, one can be successful in all aspects and no longer worry about food and clothing. Therefore, snake beggars only need to start their careers to shed their tattered clothes and stand alongside the four classes of people. So, to become a snake beggar, one must have great patience and sincerely worship a master to learn the art. Experienced snake beggars are very cautious about accepting apprentices. Any rotten wood that cannot be carved is rejected. In addition to loyalty and cleverness, they must also have sound physical strength, and literacy is a qualification for being selected as an apprentice.</p>
<p>"Catching slippery ones" is the gang slang for "catching snakes," and "slippery ones" is the general term for "snakes." But there are many gangs, and some also call them "digging earth dragons." Catching snakes must first require learning to make snake medicine, which is called "merging lines" in slang. The secret recipes are only known to members of the gang and are not easily passed on to outsiders. According to the results of the author's investigation, it is said that "bedbugs" and "earwax" are placed on yin-yang tiles and baked, then ground into a fine powder, which is extremely poisonous and can overcome poisonous snakes. But they did indeed use bamboo to clamp both ends of "centipedes" and expose them alive to the sun until they were dry. They were then baked on yin-yang tiles and ground into pills. These "centipede pills" were white and had a herbal taste, and it is likely that other medicines were mixed in. The secret of the secret recipe naturally cannot be investigated. A secondary recipe is to mix shochu with realgar, and the exhalation and saliva in people's mouths. It is said that shochu removes the poisonous gas, realgar removes the poisonous taste, and saliva removes the poisonous juice. Such jianghu sayings can naturally only be heard casually. However, when catching snakes, these three things are indeed needed. First, use messy silk floss to wrap the arms and palms, like a Western doctor bandaging a rotten leg. Soak the shochu, realgar, and saliva to the fullest extent, and reach into the hole to catch the snake. If you encounter the most poisonous snakes and many small snakes in a "dragon village" (snake nest), you must eat "centipede pills." It is said that centipedes can overcome snakes, which can be said to be "fighting poison with poison."</p>
<p>If you encounter a snake swimming on the ground, it is easier to catch. The snake beggar only needs to rush forward and strike the snake's head hard. The snake will then dart straight up, but it will still swim when it falls down. Another strike, and the snake will not dart up as high. With the third strike, the snake is somewhat injured and will no longer move. Then grab the "seven inches" area (i.e., seven inches below the snake's head). Point the snake's tail upwards, hook it on the arm, and wrap it tightly. At that time, you must not try to hold it up with force, just loosen it and let the snake wrap around. After a while, it will naturally loosen. With a shake, the snake will no longer move. Then put it into the "dragon palace" (snake basket), where the snake beggar can play with it without it becoming fierce. When poisonous snakes, such as "vipers" and "red-banded snakes," are caught, the snake gall is taken out and sold to people to eat. For hundreds of years, the jianghu has recognized snake gall as a good medicine for treating blurred vision. Non-poisonous snakes, such as "green whips" and "yellow whips," can be skinned and eaten, and are said to be very delicious. It's just that they cannot be cooked in iron or steel pots. Water cannot be scooped with a copper spoon either, but must be done with earthenware pots, otherwise it will be poisonous, probably due to chemical reactions.</p>
<p>After learning how to catch snakes, snake beggars can go into business alone. Having snakes is equivalent to having money. Selling snake medicine, selling live snakes, and selling snake gall are all ways to make a living. It is said that simmering snake skin into ashes and applying it to cold and sauce-rotted feet has a miraculous effect. Applying powdered borneol to festering wounds under snake skin also has the possibility of healing. Snake beggar's eye medicine is very valuable, but in fact, it is a mixture of snake gall and coptis and other medicines. Snake meat can be used as food, salted or plain, dried or fresh, and is said to have the effect of removing ringworm, but this cannot be verified.</p>

<h3>The Beginning of Democracy — "A Good Start is Half the Battle" —</h3>
<p>— Jurist Lou Tongsun</p>
<p>The "Shen Bao" New Year's Day supplement solicited articles, and just as the National Assembly's constitution-making work has entered an important stage—the Comprehensive Review Committee is seeking compromises on all the particularly significant issues that the various review committees have failed to resolve, and will soon present a report and begin the second reading—my feelings are complex and profound. It can truly be said that, faced with the entire twenty-four dynastic histories, I don't know where to begin! As one of the delegates, and also as someone who originally participated in drafting the "May 5th Draft Constitution," I have been in the Assembly and review committees for weeks, and what I have seen and heard makes me feel that there are countless issues that not only can be spoken about, but should be spoken about. However, apart from raising a few proposals or making a few remarks on a small portion of purely technical issues, I have ultimately remained silent, using a degree of self-restraint I have never used in my life to suppress my tongue, which is not yet completely decayed. Why is this? Why is this? I am also clearly aware that there are many people in this Assembly who hold the same attitude. I know that I have not made any agreements with anyone, nor have I lost my personal freedom of speech, yet I am present at the Assembly almost as a cheerleader for the draft constitution proposed by the National Government, so that it can be completed quickly: I clap my hands, raise my hand, or press the button to approve of anything that can boost the draft's momentum; otherwise, I hesitate and am cautious, though my heart may disapprove, my mouth does not speak, and my hand does not move, secretly fearing that I will gain the sympathy of the audience, as if overturning the original proposal would inevitably cause the country to suffer inexpressible harm. This kind of psychological inner turmoil, contradiction, and pain, though I knowingly commit it, what is the reason for it?</p>
<p>By the time this article of mine is published, it may be the day when the Constitution of the Republic of China is formally promulgated. What the content of the Constitution will ultimately be, I cannot yet predict as I draft this article. But what can be asserted is that, since this National Assembly is no longer a conference of one party or faction but a national conference, the Constitution that will soon be promulgated will also not be a Constitution of one party or faction but a Constitution jointly made by the people of the whole country. This is in line with what the "Kuomintang's Declaration" said: "Only after the Kuomintang is deeply integrated with the people can the Chinese nation hope for true freedom and independence." Also, the declaration of the Kuomintang's First National Congress once said: "The constitution's effectiveness depends entirely on the support of the people." Only a constitution jointly made in close integration with the people can gain the support of the people. The Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese people have had a close relationship from the beginning. For more than fifty years, the Chinese Kuomintang has advocated revolution, overthrown the Qing Dynasty, completed unification, and defeated powerful enemies. Under the great righteousness of the Three Principles of the People and the National Revolution, countless lives and property have been sacrificed, with people advancing wave upon wave, persevering despite setbacks. The Kuomintang has in reality thoroughly fused with the blood and sweat of the people of the whole country from the beginning. Now, the Kuomintang is once again adhering to its consistent policy of resolutely convening the National Assembly as soon as possible and promulgating a constitution, in order to return power to the people. This spirit of great benevolence, great courage, utmost righteousness, and utmost strength should be understood and appreciated by the people of the country. However, in the constitution-making conference, the aforementioned majority of delegates who deeply understood the overall situation could not avoid falling into the painful situation of saying one thing and thinking another. On the other hand, a small number of parties appeared to be quite arrogant regarding textual issues that were not of great importance. They put great pressure on the majority of delegates, but the majority of delegates were ultimately able to put aside their own preferences and accept constitutional theories and provisions that they were unwilling to accept in their hearts. It is estimated that within a few days, the entire draft constitution will be passed by the Assembly and "promulgated throughout the country, to be followed by all forever." In this unprecedented conference, in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, the approximately 1,700 delegates from various parties, factions, and strata were able to fully demonstrate this great spirit of mutual tolerance. This is due to the influence of revolutionary doctrines and the charisma of the chairman, but also the virtues of the delegates in taking the overall situation into consideration and working together in harmony, which are the traditional Chinese cultural values of self-discipline, restoring ritual, and forgetting oneself for the sake of the public. There is much to be praised!</p>
<p>The West has a saying: "A good beginning is half the battle." This National Assembly is a historic conference. At the beginning of learning democracy, it has achieved this democratic effect. The author, in addition to feeling uneasy, conflicted, depressed, and sentimental, is filled with infinite hope for the future of our country's democracy.</p>
<p>My saying this is neither self-consolation nor self-deception, but can be said to be a self-encouragement formed from a mixture of the two. I would like to express it at the time of completing the constitution and offering New Year's greetings, to encourage the people of the country together.</p>
<p>Wood must rot from within before insects can grow. The Kuomintang has made great contributions to China, which is universally recognized. Yet, at the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, there was the Political Consultative Conference. Looking at the situation during the consultation process, the Kuomintang was almost in the position of being judged. The fact that a minority controlled the majority in this National Assembly is enough to prove the Kuomintang's extremely difficult and unfavorable position. This is due to the objective environment created by several complex and important factors in domestic and foreign politics and economics; but it is also an undeniable fact that some of the Kuomintang's measures over the years have not fully satisfied the hopes of the people of the whole country. In all fairness, these facts are mostly caused by irresistible forces and less by poor planning. "Not seeking merit, but seeking to avoid mistakes," should be emphasized in terms of personal conduct. But in terms of national politics and the rule of a political party, merit is what should be done, and mistakes are the responsibility that should be borne. Moreover, the Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, seeking merit in everything and determined to be responsible, as can be seen in the party's and Chairman Chiang's past documents and declarations. The minority parties, while not forgetting the majority party's great achievements in governing the country for a long time, also want to hold it accountable for its real responsibilities. This cannot be said to be something that should not happen. The Kuomintang, without relying on its merits or avoiding its responsibilities, is earnestly making a constitution to return power to the people. This is the spirit of a great party with revolutionary nation-building, principles, and beliefs, and the success of this National Assembly is mostly due to this spirit as a guiding principle. Doesn't Mr. Sun say? "In revolutionary undertakings, nothing is more difficult than destruction, and nothing is easier than construction. Now that the difficult ones have succeeded (such as overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Expedition, unification, and the victory of the War of Resistance), while the easy ones have failed, what is the reason for this? It is only because it is easy that many people do not know its necessity and neglect it, which is why it fails. Why is it called easy? Because destruction has been completed, and resistance has been greatly reduced. When resistance is eliminated, we can do anything without restriction, which is very different from the situation when planning destruction, where slight carelessness can lead to unforeseen consequences?" (Sun Wen's Theory, Sixth Army) Judging from the atmosphere of this National Assembly, the Kuomintang delegates may inevitably feel that they have failed, but the great task of making a constitution has ultimately been successful. Thus, although construction is easy, it is not often defeated. Since all the previous resistance has been eliminated by the Kuomintang, laying the foundation for construction, we are now free to do anything without restriction. If, after the promulgation of the constitution and the implementation of constitutional government, the democratic government formed by various parties and factions throughout the country is still unable to achieve unification and peace, thus completing the task of revolutionary nation-building, then how will we explain our spirit of tolerance and national planning to the world and future generations? This is what the author wishes to share with the people of the country as a warning, in addition to self-encouragement!</p>
<p>As for the specific issues in the content of the constitution that have been hotly debated, opposed, and revised, such as the form of government, the capital, the organization and powers of the National Assembly, the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, and the methods of producing legislative and supervisory committee members, etc., if measured against Mr. Sun Yat-sen's theory of the five-power constitution, it would not be difficult to establish a considerable standard, but in the discussion of a democratic conference, there is also no absolute standard. Why is this? Politics emphasizes compromise, and democracy values harmony. If all parties insist on their own opinions and are intolerant, then there is no need for a conference at all. Therefore, in terms of a democratic conference, whatever is accepted and passed by the Assembly, its theory or provisions are considered by the conference to be superior and correct; conversely, they are considered inferior and incorrect. The minority obeying the majority is a common practice in democratic politics; the majority tolerating the minority is a characteristic of the actual situation. Correct theories can be deduced to produce logical facts; but the current facts must also be formed by some insurmountable objective conditions. Therefore, at this time, in China, when making a constitution, it is more advantageous to accommodate the facts than to talk about theories. What do you think of this, wise people?

<h3>New Year's Greetings</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tixuan</p>
<p>On the first day of the 36th year of the Republic of China, when the year is renewed and the constitution is promulgated, all countries look up to it, and hundreds of millions of people celebrate together. The dust is gone from the world, and I wish to hear the sound of joy throughout the land; spring fills the divine land, and I will chant the words of revival and glory.</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow leaving the string, and I entrust my New Year's greetings to colorful stationery. The constitution's draft has sought wisdom for a century, like the Great Xia dynasty. The brush blossoms overnight, foretelling spring. I pity the past days that have been spent in vain, and I want to help the people out of their suffering. The chaos in the South has gradually subsided. Gradually, I see the plum blossoms and willows charming the mountains and rivers.</p>
<h3>The 35th Year of the Republic of China (1946) Political Consultative Conference: Ten Major Domestic Events</h3>
<p>— From our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>Among the news published in newspapers throughout the year, the most space and attention was naturally given to the peace talks between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In the half-year after Japan's surrender, the CCP's army, by preventing the acceptance of surrender, caused destruction of transportation, stagnation of repatriation, and rekindled flames of war everywhere. It was not until the arrival of the New Year last year that a glimmer of hope for peaceful unification was seen. After much deliberation between the government and the CCP, and with Marshal George Marshall mediating, the Political Consultative Conference was finally convened on January 10th in Chongqing, the temporary capital, to thoroughly discuss various military and political issues. About thirty-eight representatives, including those from the KMT, CCP, Youth Party, Democratic League, and notable figures from society, participated. From January 10th to 19th, nine plenary sessions were held. After the 19th, discussions continued in groups outside the conference. By the 31st, agreements had been reached on all issues. The tenth plenary session was then held, resolutions were passed, and the conference was declared closed. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference covered a wide range, divided into five areas: first, regarding government organization, to reorganize the National Government Committee, expand the number of members, and accommodate various parties, so that the National Government Committee would become the highest state organ; second, regarding the platform of governance, to determine the national military, political, diplomatic, economic, and financial policies; third, regarding military issues, the government and CCP armies would implement reorganization and unification, and the military would be nationalized; fourth, regarding the National Assembly, the date for convening the National Assembly was decided, and the number of representatives was expanded; and fifth, regarding the draft constitution, several principles of revision were passed, to be studied in detail and compiled by the Constitution Drafting Review Committee, and then submitted to the National Assembly for adoption.</p>
<p>These five major resolutions contained solutions to all the problems faced by the country after the war. If all parties could continue to maintain the harmonious spirit of the Political Consultative Conference and faithfully implement the resolutions, the goal of peaceful unification would not be difficult to achieve. Unfortunately, the auspicious atmosphere brought about by the Political Consultative Conference was only fleeting. As soon as the conference closed, conflicts arose in Northeast China, causing the entire year after the victory to be spent in widespread warfare.</p>
<p>(2) The National Government Returns to the Capital</p>
<p>The grand ceremony for the National Government's victorious return to the capital was solemnly held on May 5th of last year in Nanjing, the capital city. After the outbreak of war, the government moved to Chongqing in November of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937] for the sake of long-term resistance against Japan. Eight years later, the Japanese invaders surrendered, victory arrived, and it triumphantly returned to Nanjing. In the history of the Chinese nation, what a significant and profound event this was!</p>
<p>Repatriation and return to the capital was an extremely arduous task. This was mainly in the area of transportation. During the eight years of the war of resistance, transportation routes and tools were either destroyed by the enemy or deliberately destroyed by us to hinder the enemy's advance. Now that victory had suddenly arrived, naturally, everything felt a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>In September of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1945], one month after Japan's surrender, the government formulated a plan for government agencies to return to the capital in stages and mobilized all available transportation resources to actively implement it. Air transport flew directly from Chongqing to Nanjing, and land transport traveled north from Chongqing via Xi'an, Tongguan, Xuzhou, and then turned into Nanjing. The most important was water transport, traveling downstream along the Yangtze River. The work of repatriation and returning to the capital began in September of the 34th year and was largely completed by April of the 35th year, and the grand ceremony for the return to the capital was officially held in Nanjing on May 5th.</p>
<p>The return-to-capital ceremony was held at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. On this day, the sky was clear, the sun was shining, the roads of the Mausoleum were clean and dust-free, and the plane trees lined the avenues. Government officials, both civil and military, were all dressed in ceremonial attire, lined up on the left and right sides of the hall. At exactly 9:00 a.m., the ceremonial gun salutes boomed, and the ceremony began. President Chiang and his wife led the civil and military officials to pay respects to the portrait of the Father of the Nation, and mourned for the soldiers and compatriots who died in the War of Resistance. After the ceremony, the President stepped out of the hall and announced the official return to the capital to the compatriots across the country.</p>
<p>May 5th is a day that is eternally worth commemorating in the hearts of the ten thousand citizens of Nanjing and compatriots across the country.</p>
<p>(3) Peace Talks</p>
<p>From New Year's Day to New Year's Eve of the 35th year, not a single day passed without news about peace talks in the newspapers. And the result was that the situation on New Year's Eve seemed to be the same as on New Year's Day, with no improvement at all.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference, which began on January 10th, closed on the 31st and passed five resolutions. On February 25th, the military three-person group organized by Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall officially signed an agreement on the reorganization and unification of the KMT and CCP armies. It seemed that peace should be very hopeful.</p>
<p>In early March, Soviet troops began to withdraw from Northeast China, and the National Army went to take over in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. However, the CCP troops, who had secretly moved out of the pass in advance, immediately rose up to obstruct them, capturing the cities after the Soviet troops withdrew, thus triggering a full-scale conflict in Northeast China. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the military reorganization plan all became waste paper.</p>
<p>The government issued a ceasefire order for Northeast China on June 7th in order to achieve peace. The military three-person group also resumed meetings on June 23rd to conduct negotiations, but they were intermittently held and there were no concrete results.</p>
<p>This situation dragged on until August. On August 13th, President Chiang Kai-shek published six guidelines for dealing with the future situation, and the peace talks became active again. In terms of approach, the government advocated holding a five-person meeting, starting with the reorganization of the government to fundamentally resolve the overall problem; the CCP advocated holding a three-person meeting to only resolve military issues. Later, the two sides finally agreed to hold both the three-person and five-person meetings at the same time, but the negotiations did not continue due to the military conflict in Zhangjiakou. Zhou Enlai went to Shanghai and did not continue the peace talks.</p>
<p>In early October, third-party figures such as the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Democratic League did their best to mediate, and government representatives also went to Shanghai to invite them in person. Finally, on October 21st, everyone returned to Nanjing and reopened negotiations. This negotiation was still unsuccessful. On November 15th, the National Assembly opened. The Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party all participated, while the CCP declared that it would not participate. After the 19th, Zhou Enlai returned to Yan'an, and the intermittent peace talks of this year came to an end.</p>
<p>(4) President Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday</p>
<p>Last year, October 31st marked President Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday, a joyful occasion for the entire country. Grand celebrations were held throughout the country to express respect and admiration for the President's great achievements. Among them, the "Dedicate Schools to Celebrate Birthday," initiated by the Shanghai press and education circles, was particularly meaningful and received enthusiastic responses from all over. In addition to dedicating schools, provinces, cities, and counties also made memorial gestures, such as: jointly signing birthday congratulatory albums, constructing birthday halls, writing birthday screens, birthday odes, birthday prefaces, birthday paintings, and presenting bronze statues, etc. Afterwards, the Ministry of Education designated the period from the President's sixtieth birthday in the 35th year to his birthday in the 36th year as "Dedicate Schools to Celebrate Birthday Year" to commemorate it forever. On the day of the birthday, President Chiang and his wife, accompanied by Special Envoy Marshall and his wife, went to Wuxi to avoid the birthday celebrations. For a time, the scenery of Taihu Lake added infinite splendor. The Wuxi County Government, the County Party Department, and the Provisional County Council specially initiated the construction of the "Longevity Bridge" in Taihu Lake to commemorate the event, leaving a good story for history.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Bronze Statue Inauguration Ceremony in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu</p>
<p>The iron frame for hanging the national flag was installed in Taipei just three days ago. On this extraordinary day, it was fully utilized. The bright national flags were all at the same height, equally vibrant, and solemnly fluttering in the warm sunlight. It was so solemn, orderly, and beautiful.</p>
<p>The bronze statue of President Chiang, erected above the fountain in the intersection opposite the Governor-General's Office, held a grand unveiling ceremony today—National Recovery Day. "Virtue surpasses the ancients, great achievements, both martial and literary," these words woven into a colored arch made of green leaves were praised by every Taiwanese spectator.</p>
<p>The sound of twenty-one gun salutes dispersed a layer of morning mist, and the ceremony was announced to begin. The square was already packed with people. After the symphony orchestra finished playing the national anthem, the lively daughter of Speaker Huang of the Provincial Assembly stood in front of the ceremonial altar and gently pulled down a white curtain on the President's bronze statue. Tens of millions of eyes stared at the bronze statue in a daze. The white curtain was pulled down, and a pair of white doves tied with red silk took the lead, and more than twenty others flew out all at once, soaring in the clear sky. The President's bronze statue was smiling, and every Taiwanese compatriot looked at him and smiled, a great resonance arose in their hearts. Just like when the President personally came to Taiwan, he also looked at this beautiful island with such pleasure, inspiring every Taiwanese compatriot who returned to the embrace of the motherland.</p>
<p>Twenty young girls in white dresses and blue skirts presented flowers to the bronze statue, piling them colorfully around the statue.</p>
<p>Governor Chen first gave a speech, saying: "Today's unveiling ceremony of President Chiang Kai-shek's bronze statue is of great significance in terms of national consciousness and national concept. President Chiang is the savior of Taiwan. Without the great President Chiang, Taiwan really doesn't know how much more suffering it would have to endure. But now we are free and liberated!" His earnest words spoke the words that the Taiwanese compatriots wanted to say from the bottom of their hearts. Indeed, stroking the wounds of fifty years of shackles and looking at the President's bronze statue facing the Taiwanese compatriots, one would truly be moved to tears.</p>
<p>The artist who sculpted the bronze statue, also came to participate in the unveiling ceremony. How happy he must have been to see his work displayed before the eyes of tens of millions of people. He said that he respects art, admires the leader, and serves the country, and that he can only do this kind of work with his own blood and sweat. It took nearly ten months from modeling to the completion of the bronze statue. The statue's expression is very lifelike. He himself said that he had never seen the President, but started modeling after referring to many photos, which was really not an easy task.</p>
<p>The bronze statue is nine feet four inches tall, three fen thick, and weighs 2,000 catties [approximately 2,645 pounds] in total. This great bronze statue will forever stand in the hearts of millions of Taiwanese compatriots. "Long live President Chiang! Long live! Long, long live!" The earth-shattering cries spread from the bronze statue of the President to every corner of the island (Sent on the 29th)</p>

<h3>The Democratic Constitution Comes from a Long Road</h3>
<p>— Legislative Member Chen Guyuan</p>
<p>Based on its established policy, the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) ended the period of political tutelage and returned governance to the people by convening the National Assembly on November 12, 1946. Representatives from all parts of the country and overseas, from various parties, professions, women's groups, and military units, gathered together to create a democratic constitution. This was an unprecedented grand event in our country's millennia of history. I, Xian Yuan, had the honor to attend this great event, comprehending many essential aspects of democratic politics and learning many skills in democratic politics. I suspect that many others shared the same feelings. As we celebrate the New Year's Day and the Founding Anniversary of the Republic of China in 1947, I believe it is more appropriate to share my insights and learning from the National Assembly with the readers than to write a superficial commemorative piece.</p>
<p>However, I personally have a historical perspective. Therefore, before writing down my direct impressions from the various corners of the Assembly, I would like to start from the front page of China's democratic politics. It is necessary to understand the historical facts of China's democratic politics to realize the difficulty of its creation, which is comparable to the experiences of European and American countries. Precisely because it is difficult to achieve, it should be cherished deeply. How delightful it is that this National Assembly has created a democratic constitution! So, what is the front page of China's democratic politics? In simple terms:</p>
<p>The origin of democratic politics in China, like that of all nations in the world, seemed to have begun in the tribal states era. As recorded in the Book of Documents, Emperor Yao abdicating to Shun after consulting the Four Mountains, and Pan Geng relocating the capital after consulting the people of the country, can be seen as the beginnings of democratic politics. However, at that time, there was a distinction between people of the country and people of the fields, as well as a distinction between gentlemen and commoners. Even if tribal meetings were held, they were not national assemblies, and therefore cannot be considered modern democracy. The primitive form of democracy, due to the increase in tribal population, the expansion of territory, and the economic needs and defense of life that did not allow for permanent stagnation in the tribal state era, and the lack of modern conditions conducive to the implementation of democratic politics, was lost with the emergence of monarch-centered power states.</p>
<p>In China, although it did not go through a stage of monarchical supremacy like European countries, the politics of the past millennia only showed the spirit of "people as the foundation" and did not demand "governance by the people." It is still difficult to call it having the concept of modern democracy. People-based ideology is merely a combination of the two concepts of "owned by the people" and "enjoyed by the people," with at most the addition of the concept of "coexistence and shared prosperity between Chinese and foreign." Because the concept of "governance by the people" was absent, even this democratic concept of coexistence and shared prosperity between Chinese and foreigners was diluted of its glory. We know that China has always had sayings such as "the people are the foundation of the state" and "the ruler is also one of the people," which at most lean towards the concept of "owned by the people." There are also sayings such as "loving the people," "shepherding the people," "sharing joy with the people," and "following the people's likes and dislikes," which at most lean towards the concept of "enjoyed by the people." In other words, it only acknowledges that politics belongs to the people and that the government exists for the benefit of the people. As for the idea that politics must be managed by the people themselves, it is completely absent. Because "political power comes from the people" is tantamount to saying that everyone is the emperor; how could that be allowed! Therefore, the so-called "benevolent governance" and "benevolent rule" of China for thousands of years did indeed restrain many monarchs, preventing them from openly acting arrogantly. However, this sugar-coated poison ruined the people's demands for governance by the people. Look, when King Li of Zhou was expelled by the people, a system of governance by the people should have appeared in theory. In the end, however, the people still chose the aristocracy to hold power, calling it "republicanism." The Han and Ming dynasties were both successful popular revolutions, and could have avoided repeating the mistakes of emperors, but they still harbored the mentality of "he can be replaced." Even the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom princes of modern times, who accepted Western European thought, still followed suit in establishing a dynasty, abandoning democracy for their own rule, showing the weakness of the concept of "political power comes from the people!"</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Revolutionary martyrs shed their blood and patriotic people exhausted their sweat to establish the Republic of China. However, the people, after being shackled by thousands of years of monarchical politics, suddenly became masters of the republic. Lacking the ability to shoulder political responsibilities and the interest in concerning themselves with politics, all power naturally fell into the hands of ambitious people, leading to endless turmoil. Foresighted of this, Sun Yat-sen planned to use the military government period to carry out the destruction of the revolution, the tutelage period to carry out the construction of the revolution, and the constitutional government period to complete the purpose of the revolution, with a clear and orderly procedure. The tutelage was not dictatorship, but rather leading the people onto the road of democracy, and returning governance to the people, standing with all parties under the democratic constitution, was its ultimate goal. The Chinese Nationalist Party never sought political power for its own interests; the tutelage was an obligation rather than a right. If not for foreign aggression, the implementation of constitutional government would have been ten years ago, and if not for the stubborn opinions of the parties after the victory, the constitution would have been drafted half a year earlier. In the end, because the National Revolution stemmed from selflessness and utmost sincerity, it was willing to fully accommodate the opinions of all parties after the victory, even at the cost of repeatedly postponing the National Assembly, in pursuit of domestic peace. Finally, it obtained the cooperation of enlightened parties and non-partisan social figures. The assembly opened and drafted the constitution. For parties that did not submit their lists, seats were still reserved, hoping for their participation. At the same time, the government's proposed draft constitution maintained the principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference in every aspect. For this reason, the senior cadres of the Chinese Nationalist Party spent countless energy, held countless meetings, and repeatedly advised their party members, hoping that they would smoothly pass this democratic constitution. This tolerant attitude of considering party interests is truly the essence of democratic politics. It is rarely seen in political parties in other countries around the world. Now, China has ended the Chinese Nationalist Party's tutelage and begun national politics. However, its process has had a long and arduous history, and involved many compromises and considerable deliberation. Ultimately, it achieved the goal of directly returning governance to the people, placing every citizen in the position of an emperor. This is what we first understand from this great beginning of ending the tutelage, returning governance to the people, convening the National Assembly, and drafting the democratic constitution.</p>
<p>Indeed! Although Sun Yat-sen set the stage for the period of tutelage, the expected results of the tutelage were not fully achieved due to internal and external troubles, which cannot be denied, and may inevitably reduce the efficiency of the implementation of democratic politics. However, since the people of the whole country hoped to return governance to the people as soon as possible, the Chinese Nationalist Party did not seek self-interest from the tutelage. If the Japanese invaders had not deeply penetrated, the tutelage would have ended long ago. However, during this period of resistance against Japan, the convening of the National Political Council and the establishment of provincial and county councils also created many bridges and foundations for democratic politics. Moreover, as a result of the tutelage period, the people have fully developed an interest in concerning themselves with politics, which can be said to be more than half successful. As for the ability to shoulder political responsibilities, even if it is not sound, it can gradually be acquired through learning. The convening of this National Assembly can be said to be the people's first learning experience in concerning themselves with national politics. In fact, society is developing forward every day, the times are progressing forward every day, and humans are constantly learning. It is not limited to understanding the meaning of democratic politics before learning the skills of democratic politics.</p>
<p>(II) Not only must everyone have a say, but everyone must also have food to eat</p>
<p>Secondly, I personally graduated from the Department of Political Science at Peking University, and served as an assistant teacher in the Department of Political Science for several years. Until 1930, I taught political science courses at various universities in Shanghai. After that, although I focused on law, I never completely abandoned subjects related to political science. Therefore, my second impression is that China's future democratic politics at least contains three aspects of meaning. In addition to political democracy, it must also consider international democracy, and value economic democracy even more. Only in this way can we achieve the most perfect democratic politics, which was fully revealed during this drafting of the constitution. We know that political life in social phenomena is like the skin, muscles, and bones of the human body. Without it, the body cannot be protected or supported, and all organs would have nothing to rely on. It is indeed very important. However, the national spirit and cultural life, similar to the brain and nerves, and the economic life, similar to blood circulation, are equally valuable to the skin, muscles, and bones in a person's thinking, movement, and nourishment. Therefore, although democratic politics is based on political democracy, international democracy and economic democracy must not be neglected. The Three Principles of the People - Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood - are aimed at these three aspects; they are broader than the concepts of government of the people, by the people, for the people, and include the entire meaning of democracy.</p>
<p>Nationalism enables all ethnic groups within the country to equally form the Chinese nation and coexist with all ethnic groups in the world; that is, it promotes its own culture and promotes the exchange of world cultures, seeking the survival of its own nation without hindering the survival of other nations. Abiding by international charters and supporting small and weak nations is to seek international democracy from ourselves first; China's past ideal of coexistence and shared prosperity with other ethnic groups is also developed from this. Therefore, nationalism not only makes all ethnic groups within the country equal, but also lays the cornerstone of international democracy. If this concept is ignored and only political and economic democracy is sought, it becomes one-sided democracy, which is not valuable from the perspective of all mankind. Moreover, in practice, without considering international democracy, it may not be possible to truly embark on the road of democracy domestically; the past aggressor nations are good examples. As for the two meanings of democracy, political and economic, one should not be overemphasized over the other. The democracy of general capitalist countries, where everyone has a say, outwardly attaches importance to the spirit of governance by the people. However, most people only have the right in name, and the actual benefits are in the hands of big capitalists. No wonder some people say that such democracy is not thorough. The democracy of some socialist countries, where everyone has food to eat, in practice attaches importance to the spirit of "for the people". However, most people cannot participate in the decision-making process and only enjoy the results that have been shown to them. No wonder some people say that such democracy has lost its essence. Because each only obtains a part of democracy, there is a flaw exposed. It must contain all three aspects of meaning, and then it is truly the democratic politics needed by mankind.</p>
<p>The democratic constitution drafted this time has declared in its preamble that it is based on Sun Yat-sen's legacy of establishing the Republic of China, and the three aspects of democratic meaning are all absorbed in the charter. The articles emphasize the spirit of national politics everywhere, which strengthens the effectiveness of political democracy, which goes without saying. Regarding the attitude towards foreign affairs and economic measures, on the surface, they seem to be policy matters and do not necessarily need to be included in the constitution, but because they are indispensable parts of democratic politics, they cannot destroy the tripartite balance or create a crippled situation. Although everyone did not hesitate to argue heatedly and dispute during the discussion, it was all to seek how to stipulate it so that it would be appropriate technically, but there was no disagreement on such fundamental principles. The development of China's democratic politics in the future will not only thoroughly realize national politics and seek economic equality, but also support world peace and protect international security; this is what we must understand from this great beginning of ending tutelage, returning government to the people, convening the National Assembly, and drafting the democratic constitution.</p>
<p>This solemn and great democratic constitution, although Sun Yat-sen previously enlightened its spirit, enabled democracy to progress in three aspects. However, I think that the representatives from the people do not necessarily have a deep understanding of constitutional law, and do not necessarily pay attention to all aspects of democratic meaning. Even I usually emphasize the concept of government by the people when talking about democracy, and often overlook the concept of international and economic democracy. Through the various stages of broad discussion and review in the assembly, from the speeches of Mongolian-Tibetan representatives, occupational representatives, etc., no matter how I judge their speeches, they all make me deeply understand that the appearance of democracy contains three aspects of consciousness. Gathering the views of hundreds of people provides learning for everyone. I think anyone who attends this assembly, with a sense of comprehension, even if they do not become an expert in constitutional law, will at least have a closer understanding of China's future democratic politics. Knowing without doing is possible, but doing will certainly lead to knowing more. All understanding is the result of learning.</p>
<p>(III) Everything for the country, everything for democracy</p>
<p>The constitution drafted by this National Assembly is, in itself, a democratic constitution. Professor Pound said: "China needs a Chinese constitution with Chinese characteristics and in line with China's national conditions, without copying foreign countries;" and also said, "The separation of powers is not a necessary condition for democratic or constitutional politics." Then, the most suitable for China's national conditions is naturally the Five-Power Constitution formed from the Chinese people's original cultural relics system and traditional ideals. However, because the parties are unwilling to fully accept the theory of the Five-Power Constitution, they cannot adhere to their own ideals and insist on it. The spirit of democratic politics is to sacrifice one's own views and tolerate the views of others. Especially the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, which is followed by the people of the whole country, beyond the interests of all parties, classes, and clans, and must be open-minded. If what others say is right and reasonable, we naturally submit. Even if some theories seem unacceptable to us, but others must insist on them, and do not greatly hinder our ideals, we may as well adopt them. Everything is for the country, everything is for democracy. In other words, the constitution is national, and the democratic constitution we need is neither in the nature of a "decreed" constitution, nor is it based on historical background like the British constitution, with its clauses fought for by its people through repeated unanimous actions against the government. Naturally, it cannot satisfy everyone who participates in the constitution-making process. Therefore, even if the constitution is freely drafted in the form of a "constitution determined by the people," there are even more divergent opinions. Only by obeying the decision of the majority can a common will be formed; if we talk about the original opinions, everyone has something they are dissatisfied with. Moreover, after the victory, in order to achieve the goal of peace and unification, the government party and the parties held a Political Consultative Conference to determine the principles of the draft constitution. Although it cannot bind the constitution-making of the National Assembly, from the perspective of the parties, it fully has the meaning of an agreed constitution, which is a fact. Since it comes from an agreement, the five powers are not the five powers, and the three powers are not the three powers. Each adopts its strengths and abandons its weaknesses, tolerating for the country, in order to realize democratic politics. Although it is inevitable that there is unspeakable pain for the party's doctrine that has always been believed in, in order for the country to quickly embark on the road of democratic politics and to make this democratic constitution very smoothly completed, one can only abandon one's own prejudices and follow the principles of political consultation, and let future generations criticize all praise and blame! When newspaper reporters inquired about my opinion of the assembly, I said, "Draft a centennial law with a later objective attitude, and open up lasting peace in a harmonious atmosphere." Although a constitution may not necessarily have a hundred years of effect, and the peace brought about by this constitution cannot have lasting duration, the objective attitude and harmonious atmosphere are indispensable factors in drafting the constitution, if it is truly a manifestation of the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>Since the constitution is a thing that transcends parties, classes, and clans, then all those who participate in the constitution-making process naturally come for the fundamental law of the country and for the benefit of the people of the whole country. Even though the representatives of parties and the representatives of social elites are produced by different methods; there are also women representatives and military representatives who come from special elections; they are all representatives of the people and must always speak for the people of the whole country, and cannot regard themselves as unique from others because the units that produced them are different. The National Assembly representatives are representatives of the national people, not representatives of only the people of the producing unit. Regional representatives and occupational representatives are like this, and even the selected representatives of special elections cannot be explained in this way, or else it cannot be explained that they represent the meaning of the people. Then, there is no reason for party selfishness, class views, clan distinctions, and regional divisions to transcend the interests of the country. Therefore, the constitution-making process must be in a harmonious atmosphere, with an objective attitude, for the handling of the clauses; I have repeatedly spoken in the Assembly Review Committee, often biased towards the compromise, hoping that everyone can get by. Although newspapers have praised me for being good at resolving difficult problems, in my personal opinion, it is sometimes necessary. However, in reality, the speakers sometimes argue and advocate based on their own profession, or based on the department they are in charge of, or based on the interests of a certain clan or region. On the surface, it seems that they are doing this for the benefit of a certain part, but after careful observation, it is not entirely the case. One cannot just superficially view the value of such speeches. We know that the constitution is national in nature and covers the interests of all professions, departments, clans, and regions. If the regulations on one side are not sound, it will inevitably affect the well-being of the whole country. People in the profession know the situation of the profession the deepest, people in one department know the facts of the department the most, and the same is true for various clans and regions. The meaning of the meeting lies in extensively collecting opinions, not worrying about their speaking, but worrying that they cannot speak more. As long as their views can win the sympathy of the meeting, or after being refuted by others, they no longer insist and know that their views need to be discussed, they are all commendable opinions; at most, they can only be called short-sighted, but they cannot be completely regarded as selfish. This is my view.</p>
<p>A democratic constitution is formed by synthesizing opinions from all aspects. Although everyone speaks for the interests of the country and the happiness of the people, in the discussion, they do not immediately stop fully expressing their views just because they humbly listen to the views of others. For truth becomes clearer with debate. If one's own view is correct, one should declare it to the public. Even if it is not valued, one should hold the mentality of gaining as much sympathy as possible and speaking one's mind. The extensive discussions at this meeting, with more than 120 representatives speaking, regardless of party, clan, region, profession, or women, all expressed their opinions freely, forming an unprecedented debate. This extensive discussion has influenced the revision of the draft constitution to some extent. Its effect can reduce future interpretations of the constitution and reduce the articles of amendment to the constitution in the future. Using interpretation to change the original meaning of the constitution is ultimately a compromise. Once the articles of the constitution are formulated and promulgated, further revisions are also a last resort. Therefore, when drafting the constitution, all the problems that can be thought of should be said for everyone's reference, whether to adopt or not, awaiting public decision. Therefore, when a reporter from a certain newspaper asked me for my opinion of the assembly, I replied with the following two sentences: "During the discussion of the constitution, individuals should fully express their views as much as possible. After the vote, the minority should absolutely obey the will of the majority."</p>
<p>However, we should not only deeply understand all of this, but also hope to continue to learn, so as to promote the implementation of the democratic constitution.</p>
<p>(IV) Refining mediocrity to express the refined.</p>
<p>The operation of democratic politics does not necessarily rely on meetings, but the holding of meetings facilitates the expression of the democratic spirit. In particular, the openness of the National Assembly and the drafting of the democratic constitution have allowed us to learn a lot about the essence of democratic politics and learn many skills in democratic politics from various corners of this Assembly. Now, I will summarize it below:</p>
<p>Democratic meetings are not afraid of the number of attendees, but only afraid of the lack of order and discipline. Meetings are organized. If the order and discipline of the meeting can be controlled, one should not worry about the number of attendees. Given the vastness of China's territory, the size of the population, and the importance of the constitution-making work, can 2,050 representatives be considered too many? However, gathering so many representatives together to discuss proposals is not only a first in China, but also uncommon in other countries around the world. Therefore, controlling the order of the meeting and maintaining the discipline of the meeting is certainly a difficult task. However, on the whole, everything is still fine; if we compare it with the previous old National Assembly meetings, it has progressed very quickly, which cannot be said to be the achievement of the tutelage stage. Everyone will remember that fights and bloodshed often occurred at the old National Assembly meetings. The ink boxes on each member's desk were eventually firmly embedded on the desktop, no longer allowed to fly freely and become weapons. At that time, I was still studying at Peking University, and I decided to go to the hearing. It happened that the government proposed the appointment of Zhou Ziqi as Minister of Finance, seeking the consent of the parliament. The voices of support and opposition from the audience were issued at the same time, and the members even left their seats and made a mess. In the end, it broke up without result. After listening, I was very disappointed and said, "Such a mess is not as good as our student meetings"; however, the total attendance of them was only a few hundred people, and they were so undisciplined! This time, the National Assembly regularly has thousands of hundreds of people attending, and they can all observe the order quite well. Although there are occasional shouts or boos, but after inferring their origin, they cannot be avoided in any meeting. The shouts mostly arise from disputes over the agenda, and shouting quickly is the only way to save it; otherwise, it is also a shout belonging to a complaint. (Continued on page 3)</p>

<h3>Understanding and Learning Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>— Legislative Member Chen Guyuan</p>
<p>(Continued from page two)</p>
<p>The boos mostly arose because the speaker's theory was displeasing to some representatives, and they insisted on continuing to speak beyond the allotted time, which inevitably led to this aversion. Sometimes, the booing was excessive, and neighboring representatives got caught up in issues related to order to stop the booing. The fact that issues of order arose from trying to maintain order is one example. However, these occasional occurrences were eventually reduced through the skillful handling of the presidium and the self-examination among the representatives. In addition, the secretariat of the assembly specially printed and distributed "A Summary of the Rudiments of Civil Rights" to the representatives for handy reference, so that the meeting could demonstrate its organizational nature in every aspect and contribute to the success of the democratic meeting. Because in the first few meetings, representatives corrected procedural errors based on what was shown in "The Rudiments of Civil Rights," and the entire assembly estimated that the number of representatives who could be familiar with "The Rudiments of Civil Rights" was only over 40 percent. The number of representatives who could truly use "The Rudiments of Civil Rights" with ease was probably even less. As for representatives who came purely from the grassroots, there were certainly more who were unfamiliar with the use of "The Rudiments of Civil Rights". In the meeting, everyone held this book, learning and using it at the same time, which had a significant effect on promoting democratic politics through meeting techniques.</p>
<p>The attendees of a democratic meeting, no matter where you come from or what your social status is, are all representatives. When attending a meeting in the capacity of a representative, one should never have a sense of superiority, let alone look down on others. The true essence of democracy lies first in being able to respect the personality of others, and respecting the personality of others is respecting one's own personality. Therefore, the speeches of others should never be disregarded because of their humble status, nor should one show an attitude of disdain. Even if the speaking skills are not very high, and the reasons for the arguments are not very sufficient, there may still be a valuable insight to be adopted, or even if not, it can be used to refute and prove one's own views are superior. Being able to listen to the opinions of others with an open mind is a manifestation of respecting the personality of others in the meeting, and it is essential to realizing the spirit of democracy. Conversely, since you know others are the same, the rules that others must abide by must also be followed by yourself, and you cannot uniquely seek to be different. In a democratic meeting, there should never be the pride of "a crane standing among chickens," but only the attitude of "treating each other as equals." Humility demeans one's own personality, while pride damages the personality of others. For example, the speaking time during the discussion of proposals, except for reports and questions, is limited to five minutes per person. This is necessary to ensure equal speaking opportunities. This statutory time is stated in the rules of procedure, and everyone should abide by it, unless the chairman specifically permits it, or the entire assembly unanimously supports you to continue speaking for more than five minutes. It is absolutely wrong to think that you are superior to others, or that your reasoning is absolutely correct and that you can disregard such restrictions. It must be known that concise words are not verbose, and there is no need to be verbose. Even if there are profound theories that need to be detailed, they can also be expressed in other ways without taking up the speaking time of others. During a general discussion, I requested to speak and submitted it to the chairman, and it was my turn three days later. With this ample time, I spent a lot of brainpower to ensure that the content of the speech, every word, was not empty talk, and matched the five-minute speaking time exactly, and fortunately received good reviews from the attendees. From this, I realized that in a democratic style, one can only seek expression from the ordinary, and the skills of expression must be deeply learned and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>(V) It is Politics of the Entire People, Politics of the Majority, Politics in Which Everyone Has a Share</p>
<p>Democratic politics is the politics of the entire people, and it is necessary to take the interests of the entire people as its own interests; but among the entire people, there are always some who need support and assistance before they can truly achieve the practical goal of safeguarding the interests of all. Therefore, in the assembly, I not only expressed sympathy for the women representatives who were fighting for the number of electoral seats, and for the Mongol and Tibetan representatives who were requesting various forms of assistance, but also automatically made some compromise proposals. I always feel that legal equality is formal, and it is necessary to target the facts to achieve actual equality before it can be considered thorough. Although from a purely theoretical standpoint, the regulations on the number of women elected seem to lose the meaning of equality; but from a purely factual standpoint, what good is this nominal equality to women? I also feel that since the situation of the Mongols and Tibetans is special, it is reasonable to seek a kind of guarantee in the constitution, and it should not be the case that because we suspect they have other intentions, we do not give them the reasonable regulations that they should have. Since they attended the National Assembly and participated in the drafting of the constitution, they must have considered themselves a member of the Chinese nation, and we must always consider the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last wishes, especially love and support them to the end. As for social security and the interests of farmers and workers, many representatives in this conference paid special attention to them, and I also expressed my deep sympathy. Although various relevant proposals do not need to be incorporated into the constitutional clauses, the unanimous opinion of the assembly is that it is a major direction in the application of democratic politics in the future.</p>
<p>Democratic politics is also the politics of the majority in the decision of opinions, so to gain sympathy for a proposition, it is necessary to first gain the understanding of the majority. As for the inherent value of the proposition itself, that is a secondary question. During the extensive speeches at this conference, a representative proposed the words "reserve president," and the entire assembly burst into laughter. He then said, "Don't laugh, everyone. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen first proposed the Five-Power Constitution, everyone also thought it was strange," and the entire assembly laughed even more. In fact, if you think about it calmly, his intention may not be without merit. It is only because he believes that the prestige of the president is due to the social status cultivated on weekdays, and that the method of storing talents cannot be used to allow him to cultivate the prestige of being worthy of the president in the position of "reserve president." Even if this representative has other reasons, he can still think of other ways to do it, and there is no need to suddenly bring out this unfamiliar "reserve president" in this conference, which is surprising to everyone. At the same time, a representative proposed the name "Constitution Implementation Law." People who study law have never heard of this name, because how the constitution is implemented can only be determined in the chapter on the implementation of the constitution, or a transitional measure can be decided by the people who drafted the constitution. However, in nature, it still belongs to a part of the constitution, and is not like civil and criminal law, which has its own implementation law. However, the representatives in the meeting felt that the provisions on the implementation of the constitution in the draft constitution were not very comprehensive, and how to implement it was a question to be resolved. Therefore, when this statement came out, the entire assembly applauded, and the creation of legal precedents often comes from this. It can be seen that in a democratic meeting, if a proposition wants to be valued, it must strive for the sympathy of the majority. It is said that "if you listen to the people separately, you will be foolish, but if you listen to them together, you will be wise." The place where wisdom lies is that it has the support of the majority. With the support of the majority, even if it is not the truth, it is the truth. Unless you have the spirit of standing alone and leave this meeting, you can make yourself believe that the argument that you think is the truth will not be coldly regarded by the attendees.</p>
<p>Democratic politics is also politics in which everyone has a share. Therefore, activities under democratic politics require preparation and the courage to move forward extremely. The method of retreating in order to advance used by Chinese scholars, or the method of hoping that others will automatically come to support the situation, is absolutely impossible. When the representatives of the National Assembly were elected in various places in 1937, I could not leave my work post to return to my hometown to engage in activities, and I also felt that working alone might not be successful. I also had the idea that I never participated in matters that required competition, so I did not proceed. I was seriously ill for nine months before and after two years ago, and almost kicked the bucket. After recovering, I thought that I still had years to work hard. In addition to proceeding with my own system in academic aspects, I also became interested in practical politics. In April of last year, the Kuomintang representatives attending the National Assembly had to elect 17 people from the legislative members. The election was held in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters in Xingdu on the 15th. With the help of friends, I was fortunate enough to be elected third place. However, at the opening of this conference, the first thing was the election of the presidium candidates. Not only did I still have a cold heart, but the other sixteen colleagues in the Legislative Yuan also did not engage in the election of the presidium candidates with a style that was not suitable for engaging in democratic politics. Later, the members of the Comprehensive Review Committee were three people recommended by various units. This was more related to the conveners of various review committees for technical aspects, and was considered very important. I really wanted to participate in it; and I hoped that the sixteen colleagues elected by the Legislative Yuan could all do so, and could contribute a little to the technical aspects. My unit was the Kuomintang, with more than 200 representatives, and there were many talented people. I did not dare to have this wishful thinking. I thought that I was produced by a certain unit, but a representative in this unit thought that I was suitable for selection, so I did not dare to proceed any further. However, there were still many friends who were working for me, and they told me that it had already been successful. Unexpectedly, someone temporarily proposed that they should be selected separately from the three regions of the province: south, central, and north, and then send the list to the presidium. My friend heard the news and planned to overturn this decision and implement a vote. I thought that since it had already been decided, why bother being serious? I only blamed myself for not actively competing for the position beforehand. According to the law, each review committee recommended two people to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee. I ignored this move again. At the first meeting, I was caught off guard because I had not been notified of the vote in advance. When I arrived at the place of the Third Review Committee, they were voting and there was no hope. When I turned to the place of the First Review Committee, they were about to vote. At this time, two or three representatives from a certain unit temporarily engaged in activities for me in the meeting. I only got sixteen votes and failed to be elected. In the meeting, I also met a classmate from Peking University who I had not seen for more than 20 years. I always felt embarrassed to tell people about the election when I first met them, and I don't know how many votes I lost. A friend who came to the First Review Committee with me knew a lot of people, but I forgot to tell him that I wanted to compete for the position. When I looked for him temporarily, he had already left the meeting. This is another weakness of mine that I am not accustomed to in democratic politics. From these various things, I also deeply realized what kind of methods should be used in democratic politics, and everything still needs to be learned.</p>
<p>(VI) Introducing a Companion Who is Unfamiliar - "Instrument-Rule"</p>
<p>Finally, I have one more feeling that I want to write as an aside:</p>
<p>I was a student in the May Fourth era. The two gentlemen that I supported at that time, one was Mr. Democracy, and the other was Mr. Science. In other words, it is democracy and science. Science does not necessarily have to progress in a democratic society, but democracy must rely on the assistance of science in order to be enhanced. Especially in China, with its vast land and large population, it is even more necessary to fully express the spirit of democratic politics. The convening of this National Assembly, no matter where you live in the north or south, you can quickly receive the summons and come to Beijing to attend quickly. This is due to the smoothness of scientific study, which has achieved its effects in transportation, needless to say. Furthermore, looking at the hall that can accommodate two thousand and several hundred people, if there were no loudspeakers and voting machines during the discussion and voting, how much difficulty would there be? Voting can still be done by standing up or raising hands, but counting the numbers and wasting time is already a headache, and accuracy is also a big problem. Now that there are voting machines, hanging in the meeting, visible to all, accurate and fast, this is a necessary tool for meetings of a large number of people. Secondly, like speaking during discussions, in order to make everyone in the meeting hear, without the use of loudspeakers, the people sitting in the back would be like watching a silent movie, and the meaning of speaking would be completely lost. Therefore, I feel that the view of managing things should not only advocate imitating the slogans of the New Life Movement, making rule of law, rule of propriety, and rule of man stand side by side, but also making rule of law, rule of propriety, rule of man, and "instrument-rule" stand side by side. I have gained a proof in this conference. "Understand propriety and righteousness" - can be said to be "rule of propriety"; "know integrity, shame, and responsibility" - can be said to be "rule of man"; "observe discipline" - can be said to be "rule of law"; everything must be scientific, that is "instrument-rule".</p>
<p>The advancement of democratic politics cannot be separated from the rule of law, which everyone knows. This National Assembly formulated the constitution. In a political sense, it is a performance of democracy. In a legal sense, it is the formulation of the fundamental law of the country to guarantee the implementation of democratic politics and to be the source of the rule of law. Taking the assembly itself as an example, there is the Organizational Law of the National Assembly, which defines the scope of the representatives' powers, etc., and the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly, which regulate the various procedures in the process of drafting the constitution. Then, in the management of the drafting of the constitution, what is it if not the rule of law? If you pay attention to the spirit of democracy and ignore the spirit of the rule of law, then it becomes a crowd of chickens. So, what about the rule of propriety? Because in ancient times, the word "law" was limited to criminal law, and civil law and political law outside of criminal law were all attributed to propriety. Therefore, in essence, propriety still contains the element of law. Confucianism despises criminal law, so it opposes the rule of law and elevates the rule of propriety. In modern times, the scope of law is broad, including political law, civil law, and criminal law, so there seems to be no reason to advocate the rule of propriety again. However, the so-called rule of law generally only refers to the management of things according to the enacted law, and customary law and rationality law are both excluded, which is still not enough to use. According to the views of "propriety is to practice righteousness," "institution arises from righteousness," and "propriety is reason," and based on the interpretation of "righteousness is doing what is appropriate," in addition to the rule of law, there must also be the rule of propriety to make up for its shortcomings. The draft constitution submitted by the government in this National Assembly is based on the principles determined by the Political Consultative Conference. The Political Consultative Conference has no legal basis, but in order to realize democratic politics, it is inevitable to go through this stage in terms of political reason, which is the institution. Otherwise, the May 5th Constitution Draft was already promulgated according to law and promoted to the public for many years, so why should the May 5th Constitution Draft be fundamentally revised in a short period of time? Taking the assembly itself as an example, in addition to the legal basis of the rules of procedure, it is also necessary to strictly abide by what is shown in the Rudiments of Civil Rights. The Rudiments of Civil Rights is not a "law" in form, but it is the reason that should be followed in the procedure of exercising civil rights. I have no name for this kind of management rule, and I will name it the rule of propriety. Other things, such as signing in for attending the assembly, standing up for the whole body when reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will at the meeting, and the adjournment after the chairman announces the adjournment, are not the rule of law but should be listed in the rule of propriety. Then talk about the rule of man. The rule of man is the rule of virtue. No matter whether it is the rule of law or the rule of propriety, it must be promoted by people. Therefore, the element of the rule of man is also indispensable in the management of things. In other words, although the law is the standard for all things, without the rule of man, it is inevitable to play with the law; although propriety and righteousness are used to seek the appropriateness of all things, without the rule of man, it is impossible to explore the mysteries. In the future, the National Assembly will formulate the constitution, seeking perfection among various difficulties, unwilling to violate the principles of the Political Consultative Conference, in order to show great trust, which is a manifestation of the rule of man. The rule of law, the rule of propriety, and the rule of man are seemingly three legs standing side by side, but in fact they are a trinity. If you add the scientific "instrument-rule", it will definitely have more sufficient effects on managing anything. This is especially true in democratic politics.</p>
<p>For the instrument-rule, one of the legs, to give full play to the effectiveness of democratic politics, it is fully demonstrated in the second assembly, needless to say. However, it still needs to be combined with the rule of law, the rule of propriety, and the rule of man at the same time, so that it can be useful, but it cannot be indispensable. If there is instrument-rule but no rule of law! No matter what your law is, I only regard force as the standard. Science becomes a tool for killing, just like aggressive countries that do not abide by international law and endanger world democracy, which is very obvious. In the first assembly, the installation of loudspeakers solved the difficulty of hearing; if there were no rules of procedure, or if there were rules of procedure but they were not followed; then, several loudspeakers would be placed in all directions, and everyone would rush to speak, each occupying one instrument, fighting each other with sound, and the slightest effect of the loudspeakers would be lost. Similarly, if the chairman violates the statutory voting procedure and submits it to a vote, someone quickly presses the button. If someone finds a procedural error at this time and is seconded by the public, the voting result of this decision, although using the voting machine, the red light is still in front of us and is still invalid. If there is instrument-rule but no rule of propriety; no matter what your reason is, I only use machines to produce, squeeze the assets and blood and sweat of the public; just like capitalist countries that formulate laws to protect the interests of capitalists and despise the democratic principles in the economic aspect, it is also a very obvious thing. In this conference, how many people ignored the reason for the location of the loudspeaker, or used a loud voice, or placed themselves too close, which made the speech delivered to the listeners' ears unclear. I was not used to using this thing at first, and I swung it back and forth on the speaking platform, just like in a classroom, making a big joke. Speaking of the use of voting machines, because it is the first time in China, many people are not used to it. The secretariat specially printed a simple explanation for this and appointed a staff member to explain it orally at the meeting. However, in actual use, some said "press the button," some said "press the bell," and some said "press the voting machine," but they still could not achieve one effect. The reason for these things is one end of the rule in management. Propriety is the appropriateness of things, and new discoveries are made at any time, so we also learn at any time. If there is instrument-rule but no rule of man: the situation is the same as if there is rule of law or rule of propriety but no rule of man. Empty law is ultimately uncertain to act by itself, empty propriety is ultimately insufficient to respond to changes, and empty instrument is ultimately insufficient to talk about democracy and human welfare. In this conference, if someone does not abide by the order of the meeting and uses the loudspeaker to argue, or shouts at the loudspeaker at will, it is better not to have it, it is more peaceful. Although this is my assumption, it can also be seen how important the rule of man is to instruments. Looking at the voting machine again, because each seat is connected, and people who ask for leave and are absent are also common, if someone presses their own button during the vote and then presses the button on the empty seat, there is no way to investigate it. This kind of responsibility must be borne by the individual himself based on moral responsibility. In these situations, although the instrument is used as the rule, it still cannot be separated from the relationship of using people as the rule.</p>
<p>In short, the confusion I had in attending this National Assembly cannot be written completely for a while, and writing this draft is before the formal discussion of the results of the review of the draft constitution. It is inevitable that many feelings will continue to pour into my mind. But to sum it up in one sentence, the most fortunate thing for me in this unprecedented event in thousands of years is nothing more than the understanding and learning of democratic politics.

<h3>The Path to Economic Reform</h3>
<p>— Economic Expert Xiao Zheng</p>
<p>The Way to Resolve the Crisis</p>
<p>The current economy is facing a critical juncture. The livelihood of the majority of the people is on the verge of collapse, and the very existence of the nation is at stake. The formation of this actual crisis is indeed comprised of a variety of complex reasons, but the most important factor among them is the destruction of the agricultural economy.</p>
<p>China has undergone thirty-five years of civil war and foreign disasters. The organization of the agricultural economy was destroyed along with the organization of the nation and society, and it has become the most difficult link to restore. What we see today – the widespread decline of industry and commerce, the large number of unemployed in cities, and the national hunger and poverty – are all phenomena that should occur after the destruction of the agricultural economy. Therefore, in discussing China's economic crisis at this stage, we must first focus our attention on agriculture, where the nation's wealth lies, before we can find a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, and the foundation of life upon which the masses depend is agriculture. But today's world is one of highly industrialized production, and the desires of human life can no longer be satisfied by original agricultural production. Therefore, if China wants to catch up with the world, it cannot be done by simply maintaining the original agricultural production. If China is to embark on the road of industry, it must have agriculture that can produce raw materials for industry in large quantities and to a standard. And the two major undertakings that connect agriculture and industry, transportation and water conservancy, are prerequisites for this. Therefore, if the national economy is to start from the root today, it must take the following steps: (1) Change the agricultural system (including the land system) so that agricultural production is in line with the needs of industry. (2) Vigorously build railways and water conservancy to promote basic industries. (3) Promote domestic industry and commerce by improving the lives of farmers (through the construction of rural houses, the manufacture of furniture and agricultural products, etc.). (4) Promote foreign trade by reforming agricultural products. The purpose of these four items is consistent: to promote industry by improving agriculture, to revitalize the bankrupt cities of today by prospering the countryside, and to raise the living standards of the people of the whole country by improving the lives of farmers.</p>
<p>2. Guiding Principles of Economic Reform</p>
<p>In order to save the fate of total economic collapse, the most important thing is to seek national unification and social stability at any cost, so as to restore national and social organizations, and then we can further talk about economic reform. Economic reform must have guiding principles:</p>
<p>The first is to establish a policy. Our highest guiding principle for the economy is, of course, the Principle of People's Livelihood, but how to interpret the Principle of People's Livelihood can easily confuse people. For the sake of clarity and practicality, it should be noted: (1) Our economic path is neither capitalism nor communism, but a regulatoryism that focuses on economic harmony. Therefore, all our economic measures must be based on the two major policies of regulating capital and equalizing land ownership, which are based on regulatoryism, otherwise we will go astray. (2) Our business methods should be neither liberalism nor totalitarianism, but planned economy based on regulatoryism. The anarchy of production and distribution in liberalism and the suffocation of production and the bureaucratization of distribution in totalitarianism are both common diseases for those who know. We should adopt a planned economy that includes the strengths of both free economy and totalitarian economy, so as to catch up with the new economic path of the world. (3) Our business entities should be neither purely state-owned nor purely private-owned, but a mixed public-private system that combines both. Purely state-owned will lead to communism. Purely private-owned is capitalism. We must classify enterprises as state-owned or private-owned according to the size of the business scope, the severity of the nature, and whether there is a monopoly. We must use state-owned enterprises to lead private enterprises, and use private enterprises to assist state-owned enterprises. These policies are the first prerequisite for economic reform, and also the guiding light for saving the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>The second is to establish policies. The economy is the whole picture of the national economy and the people's livelihood, and economic policy is the body of national policy. Therefore, economic policy can be divided into the activity goals of each department of the economy, and combined into a national policy. Since our national policy is the Three Principles of the People, our economic policy is the policy for implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore: (1) We must focus on seeking the equal sufficiency of the people's livelihood and establish land policy, labor policy and financial policy. In other words, the three major elements of economic production, land, labor and capital, must be placed under a consistent policy to achieve the goal of equal sufficiency of the people's livelihood. (2) We must focus on expanding production and establish agricultural policy, industrial policy, trade policy and transportation policy. All measures in agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation and transportation must be concentrated on a unified goal, and production must be expanded as much as possible in the short term by all possible means in order to save our economic crisis. (3) We must focus on fair distribution and establish social policy and fiscal policy. The expansion of production will not cause distortion in distribution, which lies in the full play of social policy and fiscal policy. The coordinated development of these economic policies is a national policy.</p>
<p>3. Specific Implementation of Economic Reform</p>
<p>For economic reform, we must not only present guiding principles, but also determine a practical implementation method in order to truly eliminate the current economic crisis. I advocate:</p>
<p>First, establish a planned economic system. (1) Determine the highest authority for implementing the planned economy. (2) In line with the needs of national economic construction, gradually implement the inventory of human, material and financial resources, and determine a forecasting system for the close cooperation of human, material and financial resources. (3) Divide the country into seven economic zones: Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, North China, Central China, and South China. Set up supervisory agencies to fully develop the characteristics of the economy in each region according to the overall construction plan, and adjust the facilities of agriculture, mining, industry and commerce in each region according to the needs of national defense. (4) Stipulate the minimum amount of production of each item in each region within a certain year, and determine the method of transportation and distribution. (5) All measures for transportation, finance, taxation, and labor management should be reconfigured and adjusted according to the needs of the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>Second, make the implementation of agricultural land reform and the construction of a new agricultural system the center of the planned economy: (1) Complete the agricultural land reform in Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Northern Shaanxi, and Shandong, Hebei, and the Nine Provinces of the East within three years, so that agricultural land is transferred to self-cultivating farmers. Expand the fields with the cooperative farming system and gradually implement mechanized farming. (2) The agricultural land reform and the new agricultural system in the remaining areas of the country should be gradually promoted in different regions according to the methods in the preceding article. Develop special agricultural products and adjust their defects. (3) The surplus labor force after the implementation of agricultural land reform and the new agricultural system should be transferred to the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions. All their houses, tools, seeds, and fertilizers should be purchased and prepared by the state in advance, and a ordering system should be implemented to alleviate the current industry and commerce. (4) The land funds after the implementation of agricultural land reform, that is, the land price recovered from the landowners' income, should be guided by the state to invest in public-owned enterprises, and the principal and interest should be guaranteed so that the landowner class gradually becomes industrial and commercial entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Third, based on the implementation of the new agricultural system, plan the development of industry, mining, trade, transportation and other undertakings and strictly implement them. (1) Based on the implementation of the new agricultural system, estimate the required amount of machinery, fertilizers, houses, furniture, etc., and the state will place orders (limited to domestic) so that all related industries and businesses will immediately begin active production. (2) Based on the implementation of the new agricultural system, reconfigure transportation, finance and other public facilities. The state will immediately start building roads, dredging rivers, reclaiming wasteland, building houses and other work, so that the surplus labor force will be fully employed and the obligatory labor force will be fully utilized. (3) Based on the increased production volume obtained after the implementation of the new agricultural system, plan processing and manufacturing and prepare its supply of electricity, oil, coal and machinery. (4) Plan the amount of import and export trade based on the new production volume, and plan the warehouse transportation equipment of the domestic distribution market and guide the people to operate it.</p>
<p>Fourth, plan the source of funds for implementing the planned economy and stabilize the quota for currency issuance: (1) The expenses for the first two years of implementing the plan should be absorbed by fundraising, public bonds, foreign debts and incentives for investment to supply idle funds. (All state-owned railways, mines, farms, factories, etc. are allowed to have a certain proportion of private shares. Such private shares should also be guaranteed principal and interest.) (2) After the implementation of the plan, increase production volume as the capital for reproduction. (3) The issuance of legal currency should determine the quota before the implementation of the planned economy, and thereafter it should only be increased in proportion to the increase in production.</p>

<h3>How to Establish a Reasonable Relationship Between Science and Politics</h3>
<p>— Researcher at the Academia Sinica and Director of the Geological Survey, Jiu Zan Dong</p>
<p>Beacon fires fill the sky, and smoke and clouds obscure the sun. A picture of clear skies, bright sunshine, and a beautiful spring is still a hundred and eight thousand miles away from reality. I hope that the thirty-six-year-old Republic of China will complete these hundred and eight thousand miles as quickly as a somersault cloud!</p>
<p>Modern politics affects the life and work of every individual, and scientists are certainly no exception. The content of politics is complex and multifaceted, and many departments require the participation of various experts and generalists in the design and execution. Scientists must also actively participate in politics, and even occupy a decision-making position in certain undertakings, in order to solve problems and ensure the smooth progress of undertakings. In today's world, there is a close relationship between science and politics. If the relationship between the two is brought into a regular and reasonable state, the result will be enlightened politics and developed science. If it is not brought into a regular and reasonable state, the result will be chaotic politics and the inability to advance science. To establish a reasonable relationship between the two, there must be a transcendent, independent scientific review and decision-making advisory body.</p>
<p>Scientists refer specifically to people who are actually engaged in scientific research, excluding those who have a scientific background but have later changed careers. For the convenience of writing, they are simply referred to as scientists. This should be stated first.</p>
<p>Scientific Freedom vs. Scientific Political Participation</p>
<p>A major feature of modern politics is the unprecedented expansion of government power. In ancient times, governments could govern by doing nothing, and making the people live and work in peace and contentment without disturbing them was the highest goal of governing the country. In modern times, human life has become increasingly complex, and the scope of activities has become increasingly broad. Since politics is the management of public affairs, the aspects that need to be managed are increasing day by day. Nowadays, the duties of the government include everything. Therefore, the situation of being unable to cope with certain matters has gradually occurred. The most obvious example is the legislation, execution, and evaluation of scientific research undertakings themselves. This major event cannot be handled by ordinary government agencies, and it is necessary to find other ways to solve it. The only reasonable way is scientific self-governance or scientists' autonomy. Scientists manage their own research undertakings themselves, without being strongly interfered with by outsiders. In other words, "return science to scientists," so that scientists have freedom, and with freedom, they can fully exert their strength and move forward smoothly.</p>
<p>Naturally, scientists are also citizens at the same time. Their ordinary behavior is subject to the sanctions of laws and orders like other citizens, and there can be no violation of regulations in any way. Only in the professional field of scientific research should the government grant scientists a high degree of autonomy, so that they can fully exert their spirit of independence and autonomy when deciding on directions, choosing routes, and carrying out work.</p>
<p>The government has the necessity to promote science, but does not have the knowledge required to interfere with scientific research. Unfortunately, things happen because of this: it can use the promotion as a pretext to implement control. This is what scientists are unwilling to endure. However, because they are law-abiding and well-educated, they have to swallow their anger and endure humiliation under strong control. Their ambitions cannot be realized, and they are depressed all their lives. In this situation of bad environment and low morale, even if they can barely work, the harvest will certainly not be abundant. In more enlightened countries such as Britain and the United States, from our point of view, the actions of politics interfering with science have been very weak, but scholars in those countries still often loudly call for the hand of politics to leave science. The large-scale scientific promotion association also regards "only scientists are qualified to manage scientists" as one of the goals of the movement. In 1944, Lyons wrote the history of the Royal Society of England, saying: There were many non-scientist members in the Society in the eighteenth century, and the progress of the Society's affairs was greatly hindered. After 1820, the control of the Society gradually fell into the hands of scientists, and the progress of the Society's affairs became smoother day by day.</p>
<p>Why should the government not manage scientific research through ordinary political personnel? Politicians have different viewpoints, different styles, and cannot deeply understand the current situation and desirable development of science. Their management of science is prone to the following problems. (1) Ignoring basic pure research, adopting short-sightedness, seeking shortcuts, and unilaterally promoting applied science. This is still good. (2) Even not knowing the existence and importance of a certain science at all and not paying attention to it at all. (3) Improper use of talent. There are talents and slaves. Among talents, there are specialized talents and general talents. Slaves please people and are easily used, thus causing mistakes. Specialized talents and general talents are suitable for different positions. If they are not in the right position, they will reduce efficiency and cannot give full play to their strengths. (4) Improper decision-making, and it is difficult for the budget to achieve a reasonable allocation. Recently, Mr. Jing Xi said: "Deciding on the use from a political point of view or for administrative convenience, they (referring to administrative personnel) cannot use this fund according to the actual needs of science in our country." As early as the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the China Science Society made a formal declaration on the handling of the Boxer Indemnity, calling for the establishment of an independent committee whose members should be completely detached from political and diplomatic relations, which was also aimed at this problem.</p>
<p>The government's non-interference in scientific research undertakings does not mean ignoring it. On the contrary, the government should actively promote it, pass a high percentage of the budget, and hand over a large amount of funds to the committee composed of scientists for free disposal, so that all scientific institutions and organizations can receive appropriate funding to engage in the work they should do and are capable of doing. If scientists demand academic autonomy, and the government not only refuses to accept it magnanimously, but instead harbors resentment, reduces or stops funding, or even threatens their safety, they lose two necessary freedoms - freedom from want and freedom from fear - the result is that work is suspended, life is insecure, and life is not guaranteed. The sacrifice of individuals is not a pity, but the future of the country is unimaginable.</p>
<p>The field of politics is vast; the duties of the government are also complex and multifaceted. Some undertakings require a high degree of scientific knowledge in the design and execution. This knowledge is not possessed by ordinary political families and entrepreneurs. If scientists are not invited to participate or mastermind the matter, even if it does not completely fail, it will be half the effort. Therefore, in enlightened politics and progressive governments, there must be an institution for scientific consultation and design elected by the people. Through this institution, the government can obtain valuable opinions from experts and scholars. The more closely related the problem is to science, the more it is necessary to listen to the opinions of scientists. Furthermore, some matters can simply completely rely on their suggestions, and the government honestly executes them as they are.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our government has gradually realized the preciousness of the opinions of scientific workers in recent years, and has reached out for help on some issues. But the shortcoming is that it often does not know what kind of experts are needed, whether there are suitable talents in the country, or knowingly does not use them, and only seeks advice from guest officials. Not using talents from one's own country, but preferring to spend a lot of money to rely on foreigners, thus creating the danger of the guest overwhelming the host. Foreigners know one's own affairs like the back of their hand, while one's own people are ignorant and know nothing. It cannot be said that it is not a very dangerous thing. Even if it is said that a certain work really has the need to ask foreigners for help, if it is not selected by learned scholars, it may be difficult to get a person with suitable qualifications. As for science with great local characteristics, foreigners who come to China for the first time cannot find their way around for a while. If they are suddenly entrusted with a heavy responsibility and complete the work carelessly, wouldn't it be even more abnormal? All of the above illustrates how necessary it is to establish an institution for government consultation.</p>
<p>The Central Institution of Scientific Undertakings</p>
<p>Scientific research and the promotion of the entire academic undertaking require a truly national decision-making, review and recommendation institution, as mentioned above. So, what is the organization of this institution? What is the task? If the country has the appropriate development of various subjects, avoid unnecessary duplication, and strive to ensure that the energy of the existing small number of talents is not wasted. Second, investigate and count the existing talents, so that they can each be in their own position. Estimate future needs and provide plans for cultivating talents, so that various undertakings are coordinated with relevant education. For emerging sciences that are not staffed, seek appropriate schools or institutions to cultivate or train them. Third, decide on the major plans for scientific undertakings, such as research directions, cooperation methods, and the increase, decrease, expansion, reduction, or merger of institutions. Fourth, provide consultation to the government and automatically make suggestions to the government. This institution, which covers the whole country, maintains close ties with various institutions and organizations at all times, so that scholars from all places and sciences have the opportunity to contribute to the country.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two national academic review institutions in our country: one is the Central Research Institute's Review Committee, and the other is the Ministry of Education's Academic Review Committee. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ding Wenjiang, the general director of the Central Research Institute, organized the Review Committee according to the Institute's regulations. His original intention was to form it into a national academic decision-making review institution. Although the Review Committee meets every year, and the selection of reviewers is generally satisfactory, it is a pity that it cannot fulfill its proper responsibilities due to various constraints. The matters evaluated are either limited to the Institute, or related to the whole country but lack the strength to promote, resulting in empty words and no effect. The Academic Review Committee was organized by the Ministry of Education a few years ago. The members of the committee are all appointed by the ministry. In terms of personnel selection, it is not as cautious as the Review Committee, which is elected. In terms of business, the scope of the Review Committee is also too narrow. Even if there are sound personnel, it is difficult to take on the task of promoting health throughout the country.</p>
<p>Since our country needs a decision-making institution, and there are now two nominal organizations, how should we solve it? There are three possible solutions. (1) Since the existing two committees cannot complete their missions, another institution has to be established. The existing two committees are either cancelled or exclusively in charge of the affairs of their respective institutes and ministries. (2) The existing two committees coexist, and the two parties agree to divide the work and cooperate. (3) One of the existing organizations is retained and the other is abolished, and one of them is responsible for the overall planning of national academic affairs. Under the current situation, we believe that the third option is more feasible, and advocate that the Central Research Institute's Review Committee should shoulder this major task. First, because the Review Committee's responsibilities should be like this according to the regulations. Second, the selection of reviewers is more cautious. Third, the Research Institute itself is the highest institution in the country and includes the most disciplines. It is very appropriate for it to convene meetings and use its general office as a place for communication and assembly.</p>
<p>If we adopt the Review Committee, we obviously cannot be satisfied with its current situation. We must effectively improve it: enrich the personnel, expand the powers, and strengthen the liaison with various academic institutions. The most important thing is that the government must give it the power to freely dispose of a large amount of special funds for academic research, so that it has the power and ability to fulfill its responsibilities well. With the expansion of the Review Committee's powers, the original number of reviewers, about 30 people, is too small, and should be appropriately increased. The election method should also be re-established. The current reviewers are not all scholars who are actually working, and cannot be regarded as having entered the regular. If the vast majority of accomplished scholars in the country are allowed to participate in the election, they will definitely be able to elect reviewers who truly care about the future of academic affairs and form a sound, substantial, fair and active Review Committee. This is what we urgently hope for.</p>
<p>Beacon fires fill the sky, and smoke and clouds obscure the sun. A picture of clear skies, bright sunshine, and a beautiful spring is still ten thousand miles away from reality. However, people cannot be without hope, and without hope is equivalent to no life. We hope that the thirty-six-year-old Republic of China will complete these hundred and eight thousand miles as quickly as a somersault cloud.</p>
<h3>Self-Confidence and Self-Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Paleontologist Yang Zhongjian</p>
<p>The completion of a self-confident aspiration cannot rely on luck, let alone on scheming and infighting, or any other improper means; rather, it relies on self-knowledge, on one's own true abilities. An extra measure of ability equates to an extra measure of accomplishment. This is just like a machine, horsepower cannot be forced.</p>
<p>Speaking of the individual, self-confidence is a virtue. In all living things, including us humans, it seems that the creator emphasizes the growth and prosperity of the entire species, rather than each individual. Look at the way each species propagates, all fearing that the species will not survive, using every means to increase their numbers greatly. If there were no losses, and they were allowed to develop naturally, the whole world could be occupied by that one species in the shortest amount of time. But that is impossible. How many individuals of each species are destroyed by being unsuited to the natural environment, such as enemies and disasters. Nature's creation only seeks the survival of the species, never considering the safety of the individual. As long as a few in the vast majority can achieve the goal of propagation, it is considered satisfactory. But for each individual, they all want to use every means to survive. If it is a higher form of life, like us humans, then not only do we want to survive, but also to survive very comfortably. Not only do we want to survive very comfortably, but also to seek satisfaction in other aspects beyond survival. Such as a lofty position, superior power, etc. Therefore, some individuals cannot help but have a degree of self-confidence. The starting point of self-confidence can be said to be setting goals. Set a goal and move towards it. Striving, competing, enduring hardship are all for the sake of achieving the set goal. "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I? Anyone who strives can be like him." This is setting a goal, which is also self-confidence. It is that each individual must have the ambition to consider themselves extraordinary. If this individual can succeed, the result of their development will often conflict with other individuals of the same species. The so-called "one general succeeds, ten thousand bones wither" is the rationale for this. However, speaking not of the entire species, if a few individuals in Taiwan can flourish, it will also achieve the purpose of the overall flourishing of the species. For example, people from various countries who win the Nobel Prize are mostly white, so people naturally treat white people differently, and inevitably look down on other people of color. Therefore, I consider self-confidence to be a virtue, even though it requires sacrificing other individuals, it does not conflict with the overall flourishing of the species or group.</p>
<p>I now want to further elaborate on this human sense of self-confidence. As long as a person is physically healthy and physiologically normal, there is no one who does not want to improve, no one without desires, which means no one without self-confidence. Moreover, desires are often endless, always wanting to go further. First, they deal with hunger and cold for survival, and when the problem of living is solved, they want fame and position. Once the fame and position they want is obtained, they want even higher fame and position. But this is a very dangerous thing. Because you want to improve, and so does he; you want fame and position, and so does he. Careers are limited, fame and position are limited, and the result is that conflicts of interest, selfishness, and attacking or undermining others are inevitable. As a result, many bad habits of mankind are produced. Therefore, although self-confidence is said to be a virtue, in its extreme evolution, it turns the human world into a place where only one can survive, harming each other, and full of deception and suspicion.</p>
<p>If we talk about creatures other than humans, there is no such thing as suicide or self-harm. Many creatures, when food is insufficient, eat their own kind, or even mothers eat their children, which is common. But after all, they are creatures, not people. The reason why humans are humans naturally has characteristics that are different from other creatures. Within a certain scope, one must fight for oneself, but also consider the struggles of others, so there are virtues such as mutual concession and mutual assistance, which are not discussed in detail in this article.</p>
<p>There is also an important fact that prevents human self-confidence from developing without limit. People's dispositions are different, their environments are different, their educations are different, and their abilities to do things are also different, so naturally the achievements they should obtain cannot be the same. That is, there are many lofty positions, but not everyone can do them well or manage them smoothly. If one does not consider everything, but relies solely on self-confidence or even special connections to obtain a better position that exceeds one's own abilities, then the result will inevitably be failure for the individual, and for the group, the more such situations there are, the more the group's career will naturally not succeed, but will completely collapse.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, I would like to raise a second question, which is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is to understand oneself. Although there are many good things in the world, with a short life, it is impossible to do them all one by one. Although there are many high positions in the world, one must see whether one's own abilities can handle them, so as not to mislead oneself and mislead others. The condition for self-knowledge should first be self-confidence. Believe in oneself and what one can do, and what one cannot do. If it is something one cannot do, but insists on doing it based on self-confidence, then of course it will not succeed, and of course it will interfere with other people's affairs, which is not good for anyone, and the result is self-suffering.</p>
<p>Why do I want to talk about the principles of self-confidence and self-knowledge here? I feel that there are too many self-confident people in our country now, and too few self-aware people. The anxieties about national affairs are one of the reasons, and it can even be said to be a major reason.</p>
<p>Almost everyone admits that the ability of our people to do things is too poor. With the same manpower and doing the same things, we are always not as good as foreigners. In foreign institutions, on the surface, very few people are used, but things are pushed very smoothly. Even in the gatehouse, their large institutions only have one person on duty, but everything is handled. In many of our institutions, there are three or four people in one gatehouse, but things are still not running smoothly. This naturally has other reasons, but the ability of our people is really inferior to others, which is undeniable. The paleontology department of the Natural History Museum only has one woman. She manages the library in the laboratory, manages the registration of specimens, manages the revision and proofreading of all the articles in the laboratory, and also goes to the main library every week to select new reference books for everyone to read. If these things were done in China, it would take at least five people, and it would not necessarily be done better than she can do alone.</p>
<p>Speaking of household affairs from a higher position, when we compare the people in each of our institutions with those in comparable institutions, we know that the quality of our people is really inferior to others. In other words, we are very self-confident in the positions we have obtained, but we have not fully understood ourselves. I think that in our country now, from top to bottom, anyone in any profession who can be competent and who is praised for their work, although it cannot be said that there is none, in reality only occupies a pitiful minority. From a typist in an institution to the head of the institution himself, this phenomenon exists. Yet we still only hear many people dissatisfied and unwilling to accept their position, and still want to climb up. As a result, the higher they climb, the harder they fall. It doesn't matter if individuals fall, at most it is a sacrifice of the individual, but in a country, if most government offices, or every structure, are filled with incompetent people, then can the country still have hope?</p>
<p>I think at least some people become blind because they are too self-confident, and they inevitably think that they are very self-aware and have a feeling of "If I don't come out, what will happen to the people!" or "If not me, who else?". Everyone wants to climb up, without considering their own abilities. As a result, in addition to causing phenomena such as infighting and competition, personnel changes have also become commonplace. It is rare to see a person who can have a long history in a fixed position. Because everyone admires people who can climb up, they not only do not hate those who are promoted to one position today and changed to another position tomorrow, but instead envy them. If they have the opportunity, they can also do the same. In this way, things become more difficult to manage, and one only sees the floating and sinking of the official sea in the form of promotion, but one does not see the progress of real careers.</p>
<p>For example, no matter how high a person's talent is or how great their ability is, they resign as chairman of a certain organization today and can be a minister of a certain department tomorrow. Or today they are a prominent figure in the military, and tomorrow they want to compete with specialists for resources and study water conservancy. I dare to believe that they cannot do anything well. In China, once an official becomes powerful, it seems that they become omnipotent and know everything. These people are fundamentally ignorant, so how can they be blamed for not being self-aware! Also, for example, the representatives in the recently opened National Assembly, these are people who represent the people, who want to discuss the major laws and seek the welfare of the country, and of course there are many who we admire. But I am afraid that there are also many of them who, if they ask themselves who they represent, whether their own cultivation, knowledge, political morality can be compared with the people's representatives or political figures of advanced countries without shame, I am afraid that they will find it difficult to express their feelings. Furthermore, various parties and factions are competing for political power and for democracy, wanting to make the country better. This, whether from the individual or from the political party, is a kind of self-confidence, which cannot be criticized, but these people should also examine themselves, how is their own morality and ability. If they do not have the grace of self-knowledge, and rashly come to power, even if they can take pleasure for a while, what if they end up in disgrace? What if this leads to a revolving-door revolution where no one is satisfied with anyone who comes to power?</p>
<p>From another perspective, I can only talk about my own experience. Paleontology is only a natural science in science, and what I have been engaged in over the years is only the vertebrate department. But I already feel that it is vast and boundless, and my own ability cannot fully understand it. When I was forty years old, I happened to discover some fossils in Yunnan. To the best of my ability, I could not distinguish whether they were mammals or reptiles, so in my forty-year self-mocking couplet, there was a sentence "Remembering bones for twenty years, unable to distinguish reptiles from mammals," to blame myself. In the eyes of ordinary people, you have been studying bone fossils for twenty years, but you still cannot distinguish what is a reptile and what is a mammal, you are of course useless. But I can only admit and blame myself, and only feel that my ability is poor. But therefore, I also suspect that the work of others, and human intelligence, will not differ much, especially political science and political activities, which are not much easier than natural science. (Of course, as an American friend once told me, Americans who cannot do anything in the East or West, and cannot stir up anything, then stir up politics. This can only be used as a kind of satire.) However, some people who are about the same age as me have now become prominent figures. I am very suspicious of them, that even if they work hard, they are not necessarily like me who cannot distinguish reptiles from mammals, and treat what doctrine as what doctrine, let alone that some of them have not fully enriched themselves, so how can they talk about developing great strategies and responding to the great cause of national construction!</p>
<p>China is now one of the five great powers, but it is barely so, which has been generally recognized. But when we investigate the reason, in my opinion, it is very simple. The things that everyone is responsible for are barely so, and are things that they are incompetent to do, but are barely holding the position, so this phenomenon is created, and we are one of the barely five great powers!</p>
<p>Now most of the well-known people in the country have their fame and position already exceeding their abilities. This is because China is lagging behind in everything, and there is a scarcity of talent, so a little bit of recognition brings both fame and fortune. Speaking of the individual, it can be said that they are blessed by heaven. As Mr. Yu Youren has a poem saying, "The body is not prosperous in the world to inherit the new destiny." This so-called new destiny can be interpreted as China's lack of talent. These people should conscientiously devote themselves to their current work, knowing that the position they have obtained does not rely on their own ability, but comes from China's national conditions. On the one hand, they should work hard to enrich themselves, so that their ability and position are both compatible, and they are worthy of it. Then the country will gradually get on track, and there will be hope. If they are still not satisfied, they will not only be sorry for the country, but also for themselves, harming others and not benefiting themselves. I advise these people to be self-aware. As for the general young people, and people in unimportant positions, I still hope that they can be self-confident, but self-confidence is not empty talk. The completion of this self-confident aspiration cannot rely on luck, let alone on scheming and infighting, or other improper means, but must rely on self-knowledge, and on one's own true abilities. An extra point of ability equates to an extra point of achievement. This is true for learning, and it should be true for doing things as well. This is just like a machine, horsepower cannot be forced. If there is not enough horsepower, one will still not be able to travel safely on the path of life's struggle. Self-quality and self-knowledge are not contradictory. But if both aspects are taken into account, the country will have hope in everything, talents will be used to their fullest, people will be secure in their positions, and the effectiveness of the work will naturally be promoted.

<h3>New Era, New Mission - Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Headquarters</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhenqiu</p>
<p>The arrival of the new era of the Republic of China in the thirty-sixth year signifies that the historical mission of this stage has descended even more urgently on the shoulders of the military and civilians across the country.</p>
<p>First, the lofty aspiration of the Chinese Kuomintang to return power to the people was achieved with the successful conclusion of last year's National Assembly. In order to formulate a democratic constitution, the government, with the greatest tolerance, openly and honestly engaged with all parties and factions, and society to jointly research and develop it. This constitution undoubtedly reflects the will of the majority of people in the country, so except for a few who have other motives, it should win the support of the majority of people. Democratic politics is about constitution-making and constitutionalism. Constitution-making is extremely important, but constitutionalism is even more important. If constitutionalism cannot be practiced, or is practiced improperly, then even a perfect constitution becomes a reflection in the water or a flower in the mirror, a mere empty check, or an embellishment to decorate the facade. Therefore, constitutionalism is the biggest task of the people across the country this year, and within this year, we must see the beginnings and the achievements of whether the constitution can be practiced properly. As the saying goes, "One who travels a hundred miles is half way at ninety." As a Western proverb also says, "It must have a good beginning." As such, the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China is truly a test of whether our country can implement democracy, in other words, it is a test of whether we can follow the trend of the world and join the ranks of the powerful nations.</p>
<p>Second, the foundation of constitutionalism lies in the unity and stability of the country, and the unity and stability of the country is closely related to the premise that the army belongs to the state. The opinion of the majority is built on the interests of the majority. The opinion of the majority is made into laws, and even if the minority does not agree, they should obey. While the minority should be allowed to engage in political struggle, they are absolutely not allowed to organize an army of a certain group outside the national army, using guns and the flesh and blood of the people as tools for political struggle. If unfortunately there are people who believe in force, then that is against constitutionalism. In order to strive for the foundation of constitutionalism, we must strive for the nationalization of the army. The theory of nationalization of the army has been talked about for a long time, but to this day, in addition to the national army, there are still illegal armed forces that divide the country and slaughter the people. In this situation, can the constitution be implemented? Can democratic politics get on track? Since this new era is the year of constitutionalism, the difficult problem of nationalization of the army must be resolved this year. I hope that those who believe in using force to seize power can take the people's hearts as their own and the country's blessings as their own, gracefully change their ways, and return power to the people and the army to the state.</p>
<p>Third, in this world war, democratic countries only won the war, but have not yet won the peace. The idea of aggression and plunder still remains in the minds of ambitious countries, not only has it not been eradicated, but there are still signs of revival. An unprecedented large-scale spiritual war is underway, and no one can guarantee that the current sparks will not cause a prairie fire. Under this situation, in order to ensure the survival of our country and nation, national defense construction must be urgently pursued. The organization and plan of our new national defense were established last year under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, Minister Bai Chongxi, and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng. However, the situation is urgent, and the implementation of the new national defense construction cannot be delayed. At the beginning of the new era, the military and civilians of the country should accept Chairman Chiang's instructions and work together with one heart. When we talk about national defense, we cannot ignore industry, which is the mother of national defense. After the victory of the war of resistance, the reconstruction has been going on for years, and the state of our country's industry is distressing. Industrial equipment in the Northeast was looted in a planned manner, industrial areas in special regions were largely destroyed, and most of the industries taken over have been shut down. If industry is like this, how can national defense be discussed? Therefore, we know that the efforts of our government and people to reorganize and build industry, and to overcome the various obstacles in the process, must begin simultaneously with the start of the new year, so that the survival of the country and nation can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>We focus on "political democratization," "nationalization of the army," and "industrial national defense." The thirty-sixth year is actually one of the most urgent years in the post-war situation, and it is also the year when our mission is the most serious and arduous. The military and civilians of the country must have this awareness and effort!</p>
<h3>National Top Ten News (Continued from First Page)</h3>
<p>(V) Recapturing Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>The Battle of Zhangjiakou was caused by the Battle of Datong. The Communist army had been attacking Datong since mid-July. The Nationalist army in the city fought hard to defend it, but the Communist army failed to capture it after two months. At this time, the Nationalist army in eastern Rehe and Hebei, and western Suiyuan, in order to support the war in Datong and rescue the besieged city, launched offensives in different directions towards Zhangjiakou from September 1, to divert the Communist forces besieging Datong.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou was the actual political and military center of the Communists after the end of the war. During the War of Resistance, everyone knew that the headquarters of the Communists was in Yan'an, but after the end of the war, the Communists gradually moved some of their institutions and personnel to Zhangjiakou. Zhangjiakou has been a vital military stronghold in the north since ancient times, capable of both offense and defense, and geographically covering the entire situation in Northeast and North China, unlike Yan'an, which is located in a remote corner; especially the abundance of its products, which Yan'an, with its barren land and poor people, could not hope to match. The Communists were naturally determined to defend this new nerve center of their own.</p>
<p>This battle for Zhangjiakou lasted for a month and a half from the beginning of September, and on October 11, the Nationalist army recaptured Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>Militarily, this was a great blow to the Communists. At the same time, it made the Communists realize the unreliability of seizing power by force. If the Communists had not attacked Datong, the Nationalist army would not have needed to attack Zhangjiakou; if everyone could faithfully abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and not use force to solve problems, then this blood would not have had to be shed in vain. As General Fu Zuoyi, who led the troops into Zhangjiakou, said: "Although we won the battle, there is only grief, not joy," because the government absolutely does not want to see the country it governs full of soldiers.</p>
<p>(VI) National Assembly</p>
<p>When the top ten news stories were being selected, the National Assembly was still in progress. Now, the assembly has successfully concluded, and the first constitution in the history of the Chinese nation! Has also been formulated. This will certainly become the biggest event of the past year, and can also be said to be the biggest event since the Xinhai Revolution.</p>
<p>The National Assembly was held in Nanjing on November 15, with Wu Jingheng as chairman. Chairman Chiang of the National Government also attended and gave a speech, encouraging the representatives to complete their sacred mission. Preparatory meetings were held from the 18th, electing 46 members of the presidium and drafting the rules of procedure for the assembly. The formal assembly was held from the 25th, discussing the rules of procedure. At the third assembly on the 28th, Chairman Chiang, on behalf of the government, solemnly handed over the draft constitution to Hu Shi, the chairman of the assembly. Afterwards, the representatives made extensive statements on various aspects of the draft constitution in the assembly, and organized various group review committees to summarize the opinions of the representatives and discuss them separately. At the same time, the comprehensive review committee was responsible for the overall collation and research. Among them, issues such as the proper name of the state in Article 1, the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, the powers of the National Assembly, and whether officials could also serve as representatives, etc., aroused fierce debate. In the end, thanks to Chairman Chiang's magnanimous appeal and the representatives' ability to work together harmoniously and make concessions for the sake of the country, agreements were reached on all articles under extremely democratic and progressive principles. On December 20, the first reading of the constitution was completed. The second reading was completed from the 21st to the 24th. On the 25th, the third reading was passed, and Yu Youren, chairman of the 20th assembly, put it to a vote. The entire audience stood up and applauded, cheering in unison and shouting "Long live the Republic of China." In the afternoon of the 25th, the closing ceremony was held, and Chairman Wu Jingheng solemnly handed over the passed draft constitution to Chairman Chiang of the National Government. The assembly lasted for forty days, and this solemn and sacred constitutional work was completed. The assembly decided to implement the constitution on December 25, 1947.</p>
<p>(VII) Opening of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>On February 25, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the plan to open the foreign exchange market and abolished the official foreign exchange rate. At the same time, the closing ceremony passed the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade and the Provisional Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange.</p>
<p>This was a necessary measure after the end of the war and the hope for the resumption of import and export trade. The old exchange rate of 20 to 1 had long been nominal. Everyone knew that 20 yuan of legal tender could not be exchanged for one US dollar, but because the external transportation during the war had been completely cut off, and there was no international trade in goods except for the import of military supplies, there was no urgent need for adjustment. After the victory of the war, this issue immediately attracted close attention from the government and the financial and industrial circles. Many domestic experts have written articles to discuss how the exchange rate should be determined. This matter is extremely important, because if it is set too high, the industrial and commercial circles will certainly agree, because in this way the US dollars exchanged for goods will be valuable, and the export volume will inevitably increase, while foreign goods will not be able to exchange for much US dollars after they are shipped to China, which is not worthwhile, so the import of goods will inevitably decrease, indirectly allowing the domestic industry and commerce to prosper. But for the general public, they have been overwhelmed by the prices manipulated by the nouveau riche and hoarders for eight years, and they hope that the foreign exchange rate can be set low so that a large number of American goods can come in to lower the prices. These two different positions cannot but be revealed.</p>
<p>The government weighed the gains and losses of both sides, cautiously handled the matter, and finally decided on February 25 to abolish the official exchange rate, and the Central Bank officially listed the exchange rate as 2020.</p>
<p>The opening of the foreign exchange market is also the opening of import and export trade. This is certainly a very important thing for the national economy after the war.</p>
<p>(VIII) Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo Assassinated</p>
<p>Li Gongpu, a member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, was assassinated and killed in Kunming on the evening of July 11. A suspect, Li Chengye, was caught on the spot, but Li firmly denied it, and no weapons were found on him. At 5:30 p.m. on the 15th, Wen Yiduo, a professor at Southwest Associated University in Kunming, was shot by thugs on the street after attending Li Gongpu's memorial service and died despite rescue efforts. Various speculations arose about the two cases. Chairman Chiang was very concerned when he heard the news and ordered the military and political authorities in the province to arrest the real murderers as soon as possible. At the same time, the Lower House also sent letters to the provincial and municipal governments to declare their responsibility to protect the lives, safety, and freedom of all people, and sent the Director of the Police Department to Kunming to supervise the investigation and arrest. Later, the Chairman sent Gu Zhutong to Kunming to handle the Li and Wen cases in full. After Gu arrived in Kunming and conducted a detailed investigation, he arrested the real murderer of the Wen case and learned that the criminals, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, were active-duty soldiers. On the 15th, they heard Wen Yiduo's speech at Li Gongpu's memorial service, which slandered soldiers. After the meeting, they were angry for a moment and shot Wen to death with a pistol. The case was thus clarified. The two criminals were sentenced to death by a military court and executed by firing squad on August 26. As for the Li case, it is still under strict investigation.</p>
<p>(IX) Import and Export Permit System</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, the most urgent task for China's recovery has been to obtain materials to replenish the consumption and shortage of the eight years of the War of Resistance. Therefore, in the year after the end of the war, a large number of imported materials were shipped in, and the relief materials from UNRRA were also continuously imported. Under this situation, the materials controlled by the government have reached a considerable quantity. In order to cooperate with the country's established economic policy and support the domestic industrial and commercial enterprises, the government announced 18 amendments to the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade on the 17th, implementing the permit system for import and export goods.</p>
<p>Under this new method, all goods can be freely exported, except for the nine major categories of special minerals, rice, wheat, etc. that are prohibited from export. As for the import of goods, except for the 40 major categories that are prohibited from import, the rest should apply for import permits in advance.</p>
<p>In other words, it is to encourage exports and control imports to a considerable extent. In order to implement this system and coordinate the work of various institutions related to import and export, the government established a temporary import management committee under the Supreme Economic Council to conduct overall management.</p>
<p>Of course, the implementation of the import permit system has not fully achieved the goal of encouraging domestic production and seeking a balance between import and export, because there are many factors in this regard that cannot be solved by one thing. But in any case, the import permit system has indeed stimulated the development of export trade and has considerably curbed some of the excessive black market for US dollars.</p>
<p>(X) Chen Gongbo Case</p>
<p>Traitors must die! Especially the number one traitor—the acting "chairman" of the puppet "National Government"?</p>
<p>In March, when the grass was growing in Jiangnan, the high court in Suzhou was solemnly settling accounts with this major traitor who wanted to escape to a "friendly country" but was caught and brought back.</p>
<p>"Chen Gongbo conspired against the enemy country and plotted to rebel against his own country. He is sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. All his property, except for a reasonable amount to retain for the necessary living expenses of his family, is confiscated."</p>
<p>The endless confessions cannot cover up his crimes. His evils are obvious. Please see the ten major crimes of the traitor Chen announced by the court:</p>
<p>(1) Concluding secret treaties that humiliate the country and forfeit its sovereignty</p>
<p>(2) Searching for materials to supply the enemy</p>
<p>(3) Issuing counterfeit currency to disrupt the financial system</p>
<p>(4) Recognizing the enemy as father and declaring war</p>
<p>(5) Conscripting strong men to serve the enemy</p>
<p>(6) Publicly selling opium to poison the people</p>
<p>(7) Revising textbooks to implement enslavement education</p>
<p>(8) Using the pretext of clearing the countryside to harm patriots</p>
<p>(9) Officials are corrupt and politics are based on bribery</p>
<p>(10) Recruiting puppet troops to harm the country and endanger the people</p>
<p>The judgment was sent by the Jiangsu High Court to the Supreme Court for review. On May 14, the Supreme Court announced: "The original judgment is approved." June 3, early morning—Chen Gongbo's end has come.</p>
<p>At 7:30 in the morning, Li Zhuodong, a prosecutor from the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office, along with clerks and bailiffs, went to the No. 3 Prison and escorted the traitor Chen out of cell No. 1 in the Li character area for a final interrogation. At 8:30, he was executed in the wasteland Rongpu execution ground behind the prison. As the gunshots rang out, this generation of major traitors finally reaped what he had sown!</p>
<p>The dikes and revetments protecting Hualien City have been partially destroyed by the typhoon and urgently need to be repaired, otherwise the urban area will easily become a swamp.</p>

<h3>A Review and Prospect of the Cultural Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Cultural Movement Committee</p>
<p>Humans are the most intelligent of all creatures. The unique ability of mankind, which distinguishes them from ordinary animals, lies in their creative will and power. Based on this power, they automatically interact and develop, and automatically explore to achieve the values they desire. They select and accumulate their values to form a cultural system. Therefore, culture is the achievement of the development of human mental capacity, and it is also the value and common cause produced by the creative will and power of mankind. This is why humans are the most intelligent of all creatures.</p>
<p>If mankind did not have the creative will and power, they would be the same as ordinary animals. Animals can also create, but they cannot accumulate. They can also imitate, but they cannot select. Therefore, animals can only adapt to survival and cannot accumulate the value and common cause of adapting to survival. For example, river sand, even after hundreds of years of accumulation, from one year to two years to hundreds of millions of years, its situation can be imagined. Humans are different. The activation and creation of their free will accumulate and move in new directions every day, without any restrictions or constraints. Because of their continuous interaction and creation, they have selected infinite values and common causes, and then they can declare independence from the natural world and develop the realm of culture. The scope of the cultural realm is endless, and the cultural movement is engaged in the direction of exploration.</p>
<p>The cultural realm is endless, and its scope is determined by the creative development of mankind. The purpose of biological survival is the same, and mankind also develops and creates for survival, selecting values suitable for survival for "abundant life" and "utilization," inseparable from matter and spirit. Matter and spirit are two sides of the same vital element. For the sake of "utilization," it is necessary to create a material culture, such as the progress of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other tools, and the adjustment of the entire environment, all of which are to promote conditions that are beneficial to survival and eliminate obstacles that are harmful to survival. "Utilization" therefore leads to "abundant life," but the requirements for "abundant life" are not so simple. In addition to material utilization, mankind also requires comfort, pleasure, order, expansion, freedom, etc. For the satisfaction of these desires, there must be the creation of spiritual culture, and politics, language, ethics, literature, art, and religion are produced accordingly. The combination of "utilization" and "abundant life" is the total amount of national culture. The work of the cultural movement lies between the small self and the large self. Under the conditions of survival competition, its direction and scope are determined by the current needs in order to create and select the position that the world and mankind should obtain. This is lasting peace.</p>
<p>Culture and the cultural movement, as described above, require further supplementary explanation. "Culture" and "cultural movement" have very different natures. Culture is the result, and the cultural movement is the cause. Culture has already been formed, and the cultural movement is in progress. Therefore, we can say that the cultural movement is an activity of creating culture, and culture is the crystallization of creation. For example, scientific invention is a cultural movement, and the result of invention is the creation of machines, which is culture. The idea of civil rights is a cultural movement, and the result of the movement is the creation of a constitution, which is culture. The will and power of human creation are endless, and the future of the cultural movement is also endless. The cultural realm is endless, and the scope of the cultural movement is also endless. We can only take the needs of survival as the direction and transform creative maturity and vitality into crystallization as a temporary paragraph of a period of cultural movement.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we who are engaged in cultural movement work under the highest meaning of the Three Principles of the People may as well review the past to see if there have been considerable development achievements in the cultural realm to match the current needs of survival and determine the new direction for the future.</p>
<p>Talking about the review and direction of the cultural movement cannot be separated from the historical background and the needs of the times, and it is also necessary to recognize the historical mission of the subject. The racial and political revolution of the Xinhai Revolution changed the old view of thousands of years of history, reflecting the characteristics of culture. It was the gestation and birth of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, sending a epoch-making signal in the history of modern Chinese culture. The two Northern Expeditions inherited the cause of the Xinhai Revolution and completed the epoch-making transformation. Although the impact on culture was to remove the shackles of feudalism, the collision between China and the West and the admiration of the new while scorning the old led to extremes, forming a complex and scattered phenomenon. When the War of Resistance broke out, the Chinese nation was on the verge of life and death, and the cultural movement was coordinated with the War of Resistance, proceeding simultaneously, creating for survival, transforming the feminine culture into the masculine, the complex situation into the unified, the extreme trends into the moderate, as well as the awakening of the cultural circles and the expansion of the cultural realm. In a word, it was the improvement and enrichment of the content of culture. We can analyze the content of culture to review the guidelines and achievements of the cultural movement in the past eight years.</p>
<p>In terms of academic theory, although the May Fourth New Culture Movement ended the shackles of feudalism, it inevitably had the feeling of "burning all jade and stone together." For a time, the new had not matured, and the old was overthrown across the board. Foreign culture formed a situation of usurping the host's position. Debates and arguments were often stubborn and prejudiced. During the War of Resistance, in order to coordinate theory and action, the cultural undertaking replaced the War of Resistance undertaking. On the one hand, it was necessary to promote the inherent excellent traditions and consolidate people's hearts. On the other hand, it was necessary to catch up with modern scientific civilization and adapt to needs. Thus, in academic thought, Chinese and foreign cultures gained new recognition and new evaluation. Not only did the value of the inherent culture become equal to scientific civilization in the country, but it also occupied a considerable position in international culture.</p>
<p>In terms of thought and will, from the Xinhai Revolution to the completion of the Northern Expedition, although it established the center of national belief, the divergence of academic theories spread complex and complicated thoughts. It was not until the arrival of practical problems that people suddenly realized the task of everyone being responsible. The characteristics reflected in the cultural aspect are the concentration and unification of thought and will, reversing the past feminine and pure style and moving towards a realistic and expanding path. Everything is coordinated with the War of Resistance and the building of the nation. The cultural movement is the movement of the War of Resistance and the building of the nation, opening up unprecedented performance techniques and further confirming the cultural meaning of the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle for the revival of China.</p>
<p>In terms of life and action, culture is originally the manifestation of life. Mankind has the development of culture for the sake of life. From general life, we can see fragments of culture. Since China's opening to the sea, it has always admired the material civilization of foreign countries, and has developed contradictory thoughts of longing and disgust. However, since the War of Resistance, contradictions have returned to unity. People have abandoned luxury and are content with plainness. The reflection in the cultural aspect is the improvement of life and spiritual mobilization, strengthening the inherent national morality from the small self to the large self, and cultivating a brand-new ethical concept from the family to the nation. The cultural movement is applicable to the War of Resistance and the building of the nation, forming the sublimation of Chinese new culture.</p>
<p>Reviewing the direction of the cultural movement in the past eight years, it can be said that it was created, selected, and developed for the survival of the entire nation. The entire cultural movement was coordinated with the War of Resistance and worked. The cultural realm has expanded, and the content of culture has been enriched. The phenomenon of emptiness has changed to reality, the situation of divergence has changed to concentration, and the contradictory psychology has changed to unity. This cannot but be regarded as the solid success of the cultural movement in the review, and it can also be regarded as a stage of a period of cultural movement. However, the mission of the cultural movement in the future is even greater. In the past, it was coordinated with the War of Resistance, and in the future, it must be coordinated with the building of the nation. The new direction of the cultural movement is to create and develop in the cultural realm for the future of the building of the nation. We strictly reflect on the current situation of the cultural circles, and there are also places that make us alert. First, the achievements of science in the cultural realm are not as good as general art. Second, in terms of the content of culture, material progress is also difficult to keep pace with the spirit. Third, the cultural circles themselves cannot keep in step, thus forming a difference in the cultural undertaking. In the future, to cooperate with the national construction undertaking, we should determine the following new directions:</p>
<p>(1) The Three Principles of the People is the highest principle of national construction, and the cultural movement must determine its direction and direction under the principles of the Three Principles of the People. The cultural movement of national construction must be the cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>(2) Based on the highest meaning of people's livelihood, the cultural movement should promote the inherent excellent culture, communicate with international culture to eliminate misunderstandings, enhance understanding, and achieve the goal of lasting peace for mankind.</p>
<p>(3) Based on the highest meaning of the principle of people's rights, the cultural movement is to develop the democratic spirit, enrich the essence of education, take management, education, and nurturing as practice, and take freedom and equality as the goal.</p>
<p>(4) Based on the highest meaning of the principle of people's livelihood, the cultural movement is to eliminate class struggle, coordinate the social economy, and take the people's livelihood being rich and the people's livelihood being beneficial as the greatest goal.</p>
<p>Cultural construction is the foundation of national construction. The cultural realm is endless, and the scope of the cultural movement is also endless. We review the past and look forward to the future. We must grasp the main goals, determine the correct direction, and strive to develop within this scope under the purpose of survival, while also combining ideals and facts. We will definitely be able to increase national strength with cultural power and promote national construction with cultural construction.</p>

<h3>The Function of Meteorology</h3>
<p>— Meteorology Expert Lü Jiong</p>
<p>Meteorology today can be called an applied science with the most extensive utility. Every day, major meteorological observatories in Europe and America receive countless inquiries from all sectors of society requesting weather reports. For example, before the war, the Berlin Meteorological Observatory in Germany had personnel stationed by the telephone from morning till night, answering weather forecast inquiries from all sectors. The United States Weather Bureau records daily weather reports on records and plays them on gramophones from morning till dusk. Members of the public who wish to know the future weather only need to dial the telephone, hold the receiver to their ear, and they can hear the weather report. From this, one can see the extensive application of meteorological science in Europe and America. Our country's meteorological undertakings are just beginning, and some of our countrymen may not fully understand this science. Therefore, I have drafted this article to briefly describe the applications of meteorological science in various fields to introduce it to readers.</p>
<p>The initial application of meteorology was in agriculture, as the abundance or scarcity of agricultural products is closely related to rainfall and temperature. In particular, the abundance or scarcity of rainfall is even more important. To determine which climates in different regions are suitable for which plants, meteorological measurements must first be taken as a reference for crop cultivation. Conversely, agricultural land development without meteorological measurements would mean being completely unaware of which plants are suitable for planting. In large-scale orchards, the prediction of autumn and winter frost is very important, because without prior preparation, if the fruits in the orchard are hit by frost, the losses would be significant. Sugar cane growing regions must not allow frost damage. If this is known in advance, preparations can be made, such as setting up stoves to create smoke to eliminate frost, thereby avoiding losses.</p>
<p>In coastal fishing areas, weather forecasting is also extremely important. Fishermen who sail on the sea and encounter storms without being able to avoid them often suffer the disaster of being capsized. Along the coast of our country, ignorant fishermen have never known how to use weather reports, so every year, countless people are buried in the bellies of fish. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has paid great attention to this, and has requested the Central Meteorological Bureau to set up coastal marine meteorological observatories to forecast the weather daily and use radio broadcasts. In the event of bad weather, advance avoidance can be made to protect the safety of fishermen and avoid repeating past mistakes. If this plan is implemented, coastal fishermen will undoubtedly benefit greatly in the future.</p>
<p>Hydraulic engineering cannot be separated from meteorological work either. For example, for the Yangtze River dam project and the Yellow River water storage project recently planned for our country by the American hydraulic engineering expert Dr. Savage, meteorological measurements and descriptions are also very important in addition to other scientific work. Without meteorological data, the design would be difficult to carry out. Recently, Dr. Savage departed from Beijing to inspect the Yellow River water control project along the way. He had previously requested the Central Meteorological Bureau to provide meteorological data for the Yellow River basin and wrote an article studying the meteorological conditions in the Yellow River basin for reference. Flood and drought prevention are the common tasks of hydraulic experts and meteorologists. Without long-term meteorological observations and experiments in advance, plans for preventing floods and droughts cannot be realized. The longer the history of such meteorological observations, the better. Meteorological records in Europe and America are mostly several decades or more, and some are about a hundred years old, so they have better methods for preventing floods and droughts.</p>
<p>The relationship between aviation and meteorology is even closer, as everyone knows. If the weather is good when an airplane is flying in the sky, it is naturally very safe. If it suddenly encounters a storm mid-flight, the danger is worrisome. There are many examples of airplane accidents caused by bad weather, too numerous to mention. A recent example is that on December 14, due to the southward advance of a cold wave from the north, with strong winds and heavy rain, a transport plane of the Central Aviation Corporation crashed near Changxing, Zhejiang. China Aviation Corporation Flight 67 arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 5:20 p.m. on the same day and landed at Longhua Airport. Due to the excessive wind force, it collided with other parked airplanes on the field. This was still a great stroke of luck amidst misfortune. Wind and fog are the most important meteorological elements in aviation meteorology, so the measurement of wind direction, wind force, and fog at various altitudes in the high air should be given the most attention in aviation.</p>
<p>Hygiene administration also needs meteorological data for research, especially every summer. This is because epidemics such as malaria, typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery mostly occur in the summer and are closely related to the level of temperature and the amount of humidity. Therefore, every summer, the epidemic prevention institutions of the Department of Health must obtain meteorological data from major cities throughout our country from meteorological institutions as a standard for research and to take preventive measures.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Ministry of Food has often taken meteorological data as reference for judging the abundance or scarcity of harvests in various regions to determine the amount of grain to be levied. If there is excessive or insufficient rainfall in an area, causing droughts or floods, the grain levy can naturally be reduced appropriately. Otherwise, if a locality reports a famine but the inspection finds that the rainfall is suitable, it will be known that the locality inevitably has some inaccurate reporting.</p>
<p>The application of meteorology in Europe and America has almost become a household name. Boat and car travelers must also inquire about the weather conditions in advance. When building houses, they must first find out the amount of rainfall to determine the size of the drainage ditches. Hollywood film companies in the United States even sign contracts with meteorologists to be responsible for reporting the weather. This is because movie stars are extravagant, and if they unfortunately encounter continuous rain when going out to shoot a movie, delaying the filming for days, the expenses are enormous, and the company's losses are not small.</p>
<p>During World War II, Europe and America used meteorology to achieve unexpected victories. There are many deeds that can be commended and are worthy of reference. A brief description of a few points may also be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>When the German army attacked Poland in September 1939, meteorologists chose an auspicious time to launch the attack. We know that autumn and winter in Europe are rainy seasons. German meteorologists measured a period of several consecutive days without rain for their air force, so the German air force used an overwhelming force, with a continuous stream of bombings, attacking day and night, and Warsaw collapsed from then on. Later, when attacking Norway, assaulting Greece, and conquering Crete, they all followed the same method. It can be said that they conquered cities and seized land in no time, using weather forecasts to the extreme in blitzkrieg tactics. For example, in February 1941, the Germans also used weather forecasts to help two warships escape from the tiger's mouth. It turned out that Germany had two warships, one called the Scharnboster and the other called the Gneisenau, which were stationed at Brest on the coast of France. The captain wanted to sail these two warships through the English Channel and back to the Baltic Sea, but the British bombers were watching intently, making it difficult. Admiral Raeder, the leader of the Nazi navy, consulted with meteorologists. The conditions were: there must be low clouds for cover, the visibility under the clouds must be very poor, and at a low altitude of several hundred meters above the sea, the activities of ships on the sea could not be seen clearly. If enemy aircraft (referring to the British) flew into the clouds, ice would immediately condense on the wings. Only then could the warships escape the British air force's fire net. German meteorologists found that this type of weather could be produced in February when a storm passed through the strait from west to east. On February 9 of that year, German meteorologists reported that the time had come and preparations were underway for departure. The two German warships left Brest on the night of February 11 and sailed through the English Channel the next day. The British air force's torpedo bombs were unable to use their skills.</p>
<p>On June 6, 1944, when the Allied forces attacked Germany and landed in Normandy, meteorologists also chose an auspicious time to launch the attack. The Allies chose to land in June because there is a climatic basis for it. This is because in Normandy along the coast of France, the rainy days in June are the fewest in all months of the year. However, it rained every day for several days before the landing. Eisenhower, the commander of the European offensive, was very anxious and consulted with meteorologists every day. On June 4, the meteorologists told him that the weather could improve within 36 hours. So Eisenhower decided to land on the night of June 6. However, this landing involved not only meteorological factors but also oceanographic factors. This is because June 6 happened to be a full moon, and both high tide and low tide were particularly severe. When the tide receded at night, the sandbars were vast and boundless, and the faint moonlight penetrated through the clouds, which was the perfect time for landing.</p>
<p>Usually, various weather changes move from west to east. After the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany, British weather reports were kept secret, which was unfavorable to Germany. Because of this, it could no longer use British weather reports to predict its own future weather changes. However, it could still use Greenland's weather reports to make rough estimates. Therefore, in early October 1944, the U.S. military occupied the German meteorological observatory in Greenland, making it difficult for Germany to detect weather in the Atlantic from then on. After the end of World War II, some powerful countries, fearing invasion, competed to set up meteorological stations in the Arctic Circle, which is also a matter worth noting. During this war, the United States, with its strong financial resources, had meteorological reports that could almost be said to cover the entire globe. It trained thousands of university students to engage in meteorological work. The Army Air Corps alone established 900 overseas meteorological stations during the war, in addition to the reports from regular meteorological observatories in peacetime. Therefore, they could almost know the weather conditions at any place on the entire globe except for the two poles at any time. Therefore, after Saipan was occupied by the U.S. military today, a meteorological report was issued the next day. Therefore, U.S. warships and aircraft could gallop vertically and horizontally on the sea and in the air without any obstacles. Therefore, meteorological work helped them win the war. As for our country's meteorological undertakings, they have gradually developed due to the war, but compared with Britain and the United States, they are still far behind. I hope that our people will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Overcoming Reality, Creating Culture</h3>
<p>— Cultural History Expert Chen Dongyuan</p>
<p>Generally speaking, to increase the level of culture, life must be stable and the economy must be prosperous. This is because only in this way can there be leisure time, and only then can the intellect, emotions, and ability to appreciate cultural creation be produced. To talk about the current cultural construction of China based on this premise is indeed a relatively difficult thing. After being bound by a century of unequal treaties and eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, the lives of ordinary people have long been oppressed to the point of being unable to breathe. And the current civil strife is still continuing, transportation has not recovered, the economy is bankrupt, causing widespread suffering, and there is no hope for recovery. Every Chinese citizen feels unable to survive and unable to die. Under these circumstances, where does the strength to build culture come from? Therefore, if our culture is only allowed to develop naturally, there is no hope for it to improve.</p>
<p>However, judging from historical facts, the culture of any country does not rise in a straight line, nor does it decline forever. Brilliant Greece has a day of decline. Golden Rome has a time of demise. The period of decline in culture is unavoidable for any country. But extremes beget their opposites, and when things get really bad, they must turn for the better. Taking the West as an example, who could have expected the world of today's flourishing science when living in the dark Middle Ages? To explain this in the words of Ms. Chen Hengzhe: "It is like when spring is about to come, although there are morning winds and evening rains, and the sky is overcast and the ground is damp, the brilliant spring light cannot be brewed without this." Why can't we take this view of China's current situation? The problem is only where we generate strength and which path we follow to restore our culture.</p>
<p>Open the newspapers and magazines and look at our current literary works. Ninety percent of them are dissatisfied with reality, attacking reality, and fully depicting the ugliness of reality, while not offering an ideal. If there is one put forward, it is all the same, nothing more than political reform, advocating the union of so-called democratic warriors to form a new government. In other words, the opinion put forward by most writers today is that as long as the government is reformed, the country can be good and culture can progress. This is the same mistake as the reformers of the Hundred Days' Reform, who believed that as long as Cixi was removed, the country could become better. Culture is the total expression of the spirit and material of an era, and it requires the joint efforts of the entire nation in all aspects. Reforming the government will definitely not improve the entire life or raise the general culture. Democratic politics is our need today, but what we especially need is that the intelligent people of the whole country, with one heart and one mind, cooperate and work hard in their respective positions for the country. Only in this way is true democracy.</p>
<p>The insecurity of life and the difficulty of the economy are indeed obstacles to cultural progress, but to reveal the light in the darkness, advanced people must overcome these difficulties, invigorate the intellect and emotions of creation, and give the people of the whole country an upward ideal and a direction for joint efforts. This is not impossible to do. Taking literature as an example, after the First World War, German writers, in order to save the defeated Germanic nation, did not take the reality of themselves as a means, nor did they escape reality, but instead enthusiastically embraced reality on the one hand, and on the other hand, relied on the spiritual power of reality, mobility, and clear longing to conquer reality and suppress reality. The old novelists wanted to give interest and entertainment with their works, while the new German novelists wanted to give the people emotion and upward sentiment with their works. The former describes external reality, while the latter transforms reality to complete noble reality. This is Expressionism in literature. Although Germany was later led to the path of decline by the demented Hitler, the spirit of their writers to save the nation cannot be erased. Due to this historical fact, when talking about our current cultural construction, why don't our writers abandon their style of merely depicting reality and instead drum up their enthusiasm for loving the nation and loving culture to give us a forward-looking ideal, in order to change the atmosphere? Not only literature is like this, but all practitioners of academics such as the board of directors, politics, society, economics, science, education, fine arts, music, and drama should abandon their negative, depressed, and submissive attitude to current awards, and instead put forward an upward ideal and work hard in academic research and practical business. If this can be done, there will be hope for Chinese cultural construction, and the birth of a new China can be germinated from this.</p>

<h3>Engineering Construction in the First Year After Victory</h3>
<p>— Engineering Expert Hou Jiayuan</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, all transportation routes and public works in areas reached by the enemy's cavalry suffered extremely severe damage. The longer the war lasted in a region, the greater the loss. Taking railways as an example, the lines north of the Yangtze River were evacuated more quickly, so the route facilities were relatively complete when the war ended. However, after more than a year of continuous destruction, there is still not a single smooth trunk railway north of the Yangtze River. The lines south of the Yangtze River had been subjected to seesaw battles for a long time during the Anti-Japanese War, and the route facilities were mostly dilapidated, especially the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, which was completely destroyed. As for the locomotives and rolling stock on all lines, those in the rear were difficult to replenish and repair due to prolonged blockades, and even in the occupied areas, they were restricted by the enemy's so-called national policy and did not receive adequate replenishment. In addition, maintenance and repairs were extremely perfunctory during the military period. Even on the lines that were not destroyed, the actual condition of all material equipment was far worse than before the war. According to our on-site inspection and estimation, the railways south of the Great Wall that urgently need to be repaired total more than 3,000 kilometers. Repairing them to the pre-war standard would require more than 370 million US dollars. This preliminary estimate has already exceeded the total domestic and foreign debts of all railways in our country before the war. Although the purchasing power of the US dollar has also depreciated considerably, the extent of the losses suffered by our country's railways can be seen from this.</p>
<p>During the war, transportation in the rear relied heavily on road transport. The road construction in the Great Rear Area over the past ten years has indeed made significant progress, but most of the roads in the occupied areas have been destroyed. The remaining routes have also not been maintained, and their condition is even worse than that of the railways.</p>
<p>The equipment of coastal ports suffered relatively little direct damage from military operations. However, during these nine years, all necessary maintenance was not carried out effectively, resulting in increasingly severe siltation of the waterways in various ports, and many collapses of wharves and embankments. Other important equipment such as warehouses, cranes, barges, and dredgers were also mostly lost or damaged. However, during the occupation of North China, the Japanese began to build a new port at the estuary of the Tanggu Baihe River. The completion of various projects was almost half done, but the construction was stopped midway due to the reversal of their war situation. In addition, the enemy made small improvements to the ports on Hainan Island, but the scale was small, or only suitable for certain special purposes at the time.</p>
<p>Water conservancy projects in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins and along the coast are of great importance to our country's national economy and people's livelihood. Unfortunately, during the Anti-Japanese War, they were either directly damaged due to military operations or, due to environmental limitations, could not be repaired, causing them to gradually collapse. In particular, the diversion of the Yellow River to seize the Huai River and flow into the Yangtze River has had a widespread and severely detrimental impact, rarely seen in decades of floods.</p>
<p>After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the central government immediately used its own capabilities to the best of its ability and strove to obtain considerable material assistance from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The central and local authorities in charge have been stepping up repairs to the urgently needed transportation routes and water conservancy projects. The actual conditions of the various projects that were damaged during the war and the extent to which they should be repaired are pending on-site inspection and detailed survey. The repair procedures for various projects should also be weighed according to their importance and urgency, and carefully planned and determined in consideration of the country's financial resources. Moreover, in the process of this repair, we should take this opportunity to innovate and transform the shortcomings of each project in the past and the improvements that should be made due to technological advancements. Furthermore, since there are many new projects to be undertaken after the war, they should also be planned and coordinated at the same time as the restoration work. In order to quickly complete the above-mentioned plans and work, the Executive Yuan established the Engineering Planning Bureau in the spring of this year, bringing together Chinese and American experts to be responsible for this matter.</p>
<p>After nine months of hard work, in addition to the plan for the fundamental management of the Yellow River, which is currently being continued by many experts who are being invited to conduct research and consultations, the railway repair plan has been formulated in detail by the group, taking into account the country's capabilities, the environment, and the degree of urgency. This plan stipulates the order of priority for the repair of each line, the time required for the repair, and a detailed estimate of the materials and funds required. According to the current situation, the lines in the Yangtze River Delta with relatively stable social order should be repaired first. The improvement and complete restoration of the Yuehan Railway will still take two years. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Xiang-Gui, and Gui-Qian lines are expected to be restored to their original state within the next two years and appropriately improved. The other lines north and south of the Yangtze River and in the Northeast will be gradually and quickly repaired in accordance with the planned procedures and with the evolution of the political and social conditions in various places. If this repair plan can be successfully implemented, all lines south of the Great Wall may be fully repaired within the next two years. In addition, realistic and innovative plans will be drafted for the use of locomotives and rolling stock on various lines, the improvement of locomotive factories, telecommunication signals, and driving equipment, and the supply and management of road materials and machinery. As for the construction of new roads, we should focus on connecting the southwest and northwest and making them directly connected to the Central Plains and the southern provinces. Therefore, the main body of this new road plan should be the completion of the Lanzhou-Guangzhou line. Then, the Gan-Sichuan-Xiang line should be repaired in sequence, and then the Baotou on the Ping-Sui line and the Guanzhou on the Sui-Hai line should be connected, and the connecting lines between Chengdu-Chongqing and Yunnan-Vietnam should be built to complete the backbone of the national railway network.</p>
<p>Coastal ports are the throat of the national water and land transportation system. We have conducted on-site inspections and detailed discussions on all the more important ports along the coast, and believe that the consolidation of the ports of Shanghai and Qingdao cannot be delayed any longer. Especially the port of Shanghai, as the hub of the country's foreign trade and material transit, its restoration and improvement work should be actively promoted. The restoration and improvement work of ports such as Huludao, Qinhuangdao, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and Hainan Island should also not be delayed any longer. As for the construction of new ports, the construction of the new port in Tanggu should be accelerated, as it is an integral part of the entire northern transportation system and is necessary for the development of North China's resources. In addition, the development of the Guangzhou Bay port should also be planned and prepared early. This is one of the good deep-water harbors in South China, and it is located at the southern end of the Lanzhou-Guangzhou trunk line. The construction and repair of this port is an integral part of the construction plan of this trunk line, and it should also be coordinated and connected with the railway construction procedure. Xiamen Port has deep water and a wide bay, and is a naturally beautiful good port on the southeast coast, which should also be improved to make it the export port of the future Fujian-Jiangxi Railway.</p>
<p>We have made several practical and appropriate recommendations for the construction, management, and operation of highways, and have carefully reviewed the current situation and future needs of highway transportation in our country, and formulated the standards for highway engineering in various regions and levels as the norms for future construction. Regarding the formulation of the national highway network and the principles for the division of provincial and county roads, the central government's attention in the future should focus on a few trunk highways that connect the important economic, political, and military centers of the country, while the construction and management of other roads should be entrusted to local governments, so that local governments can share more of the responsibilities they should bear. As for the task of highway transportation, it should be mostly entrusted to private enterprises, so that the highway transportation business can be developed rapidly, the operating efficiency can be effectively improved, and all those who are enthusiastic about the transportation industry can have the opportunity to fully exert their abilities. The state-owned and private transportation businesses can complement each other and achieve mutual benefit.</p>
<p>In the year after the victory, the government has also made its greatest efforts to rebuild various transportation and public works. However, the entire political situation has been affected. The civil war has not subsided, and not only the reconstruction and construction work in some areas has been fundamentally impossible to carry out, but also the railways north of the Yangtze River, which have been received and repaired to some extent, have been destroyed again in this year's civil war. Moreover, due to the huge military expenditure, the national treasury is in deficit, and the people's strength is declining. The financial resources and manpower that can be raised and allocated for economic recovery and construction have also been greatly reduced. The work of rebuilding various projects has naturally been difficult to promote quickly. In addition, all basic industrial and mining enterprises in our country are extremely weak. Most of the various engineering materials required still need to be supplied by foreigners. The number of engineering materials that the United Nations can allocate to our country is not only insufficient, but also the need for engineering materials in various countries in the past few years after the war has increased several times. Even if we have made full preparations, it will be difficult to purchase them quickly and in full quantity. Furthermore, due to the extreme shortage of ships after the war and the heavy burden of transporting troops for demobilization, even if a large number of construction materials can be obtained abroad, it will be difficult to transport them to China on schedule, and it will be difficult to coordinate and tightly coordinate with the promotion of domestic construction. In addition, the lack of specialized technical personnel, the inconvenience of domestic transportation, and the continuous sharp rise in the prices of labor and materials are all sufficient to hinder the recovery of economic construction enterprises and directly and indirectly affect the reconstruction of various public works.</p>
<p>Although the overall environment is so difficult, the engineering construction in the past year has still achieved considerable achievements, which should not be completely erased. At the beginning of the restoration work, the government immediately endeavored to connect the transportation routes between the Great Rear Area and the recovered areas. The obstacles hindering navigation within the Yangtze River route were quickly cleared, and the navigation signs along the Yangtze River and various important seaports are also gradually being restored. The airport stations in the important cities in the recovered areas have been able to be quickly improved to a considerable extent, providing great assistance to the reception and demobilization work. The railway restoration work was originally more difficult and took longer. At the beginning of the restoration, the government made great efforts to speed up the restoration of the Yue-Han Railway, which connects the Great Rear Area and the recovered area, and is one of the major arteries of north-south transportation. The length of this road dismantled during the war was nearly 400 kilometers, and most of the track materials and locomotives and rolling stock were lost. The station buildings, factory buildings, and all military equipment had disappeared. At the beginning of this year, relief materials from abroad had not yet arrived, so we had to dismantle more than 200 kilometers of track materials from the Xiang-Gui Railway for the restoration of the Yue-Han Railway. At the same time, we made every effort to collect scattered and lost equipment, made full use of locally produced timber, and concentrated all manpower and material resources to accelerate the progress. Finally, the entire line was connected by the end of June of this year. Although the restoration of the original state of this road still needs to be awaited, the achievement of the person in charge of this land transport trunk line connecting the Yangtze River and the Pearl River Basin in a very short period of time should not be ignored. The restoration work of the coastal railways first started from the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin areas, and started to speed up the repair of the Ping-Han, Tianjin-Pukou, and Jiaoji railways with Wuhan and Jinan as the centers. At present, the transportation situation of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways has been greatly improved compared to the ceasefire period. Outside Shanhaiguan, the northern part of the Beining Railway has already been fully connected with the reception of Shenyang. Although the stations along the line are still subject to attacks and destruction from time to time, the passenger and freight transportation of this road can still be maintained with difficulty. The Changchun-Dalian section of the China-Chang Railway has already been opened for military use. Recently, with the progress of the military, the branch line from Shenyang to Andong has been restored. It is hoped that the transportation to the important coastal cities in the southern part of the three northeastern provinces can be smooth. After the recovery of Zhangjiakou and the removal of military obstacles on the entire Ping-Sui line, the restoration work of the Ping-Sui Railway has been able to be accelerated. Based on the current situation, it is estimated that the entire line should be able to be connected immediately. However, the restoration work of the northern sections of the Ping-Han and Tianjin-Pukou railways is constantly obstructed and cannot continue to be promoted. Although the Zhengtai Railway has been connected twice, it has been continuously destroyed from time to time, and has recently been disconnected again. The restoration project of the entire Tongpu line is not only obstructed by the military, but also lacks sufficient reserve materials, so it cannot be carried out for a while.</p>
<p>The restoration project of the Jiaoji Railway is also constantly obstructed and stopped repeatedly. Recently, the entire line has been reconnected. It is hoped that it will not be destroyed again in the future, so that the transportation business of this road can be smooth from now on. The Longhai Railway has the longest line. The section east of Tongguan belongs to the war zone and is located in the area where the Yellow River breached its banks. The supply of equipment is also extremely scarce. After a year of continuous efforts, the restoration work of the entire line can be said to be completed with difficulty.

<h3>Current Situation of Military Region Division in the "Liberated Areas"</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Information Office</p>
<p>Since the victory a year ago, the Communist army has wantonly destroyed transportation on various routes and has been obstructing the acceptance of surrender by the National Army. Since the ceasefire order issued by the government on November 11 took effect, the National Army has strictly complied with the order and strictly guarded its original defense. However, the Communist army in various places has continued to roam and harass. The Communist leaders also believe that war is the only way to resolve domestic disputes and are also called the "People's Liberation Army," with Zhu De as the "Commander-in-Chief," Peng Dehuai as the "Deputy Commander-in-Chief," and Ye Jianying as the "Chief of Staff." Zhu De recently stated: "The number of Communist troops is expanding." According to general estimates, the Communist army has less than one million regular troops, excluding the 500,000 members of the militia. Compared with the National Army, which is said to have 3.8 million troops, the strength is truly worlds apart. From its actions, it can be seen that the Communist army will maintain guerrilla tactics and attempt to attack the entire national economy by destroying transportation.</p>
<p>The division of military regions in the "Liberated Areas" and the situation of confrontation between the Nationalists and Communists are shown in detail in the figure below, so that readers can understand a glimpse of the areas disturbed by the Communist army.</p>
