<h3>蒙軍侵入新疆事件　我向蘇蒙嚴重抗議　並擬即派大員赴新調查</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕關於外蒙軍隊侵入新疆事件，我政府已向外蒙及蘇聯雙方，分別提出嚴重抗議。外交部情報司長張沅長，十一日午出席行政院新聞局記者招待會，曾於答覆記者詢問時，作如下之宣布：「關於外蒙軍隊侵入新疆攻擊我駐在北塔山之防軍一事，我政府自然已接到報告。此事並非尋常邊疆衝突事件，我政府極爲重視。當地軍事當局，已奉命堅守疆土，愼重處理，駐莫斯科　大使，亦奉命向蘇聯政府，並經由外蒙駐莫斯科公使，向外蒙政府，分別提出嚴重抗議」。按今日各記者所詢有關上述事件之詢問，多達九起，內容如次：（一）外蒙軍侵入新疆六百華里，且有蘇聯標幟飛機四架參加。此事是否與中蘇友好條約抵觸，政府發言人對此有何解釋？（二）在外交方面，政府對此事準備作何種措置，是否於今日提出抗議。（三）如政府提出抗議，對象爲蘇聯，抑爲外蒙？在我國與外蒙尚未互派外交使節之現在，將用何種方式，向外蒙抗議。（四）據中央社迪化電，阿山區專員阿斯滿，自本年二月起，即受某方壓迫，節節退讓，自二月至現在，已歷四個月。在此期間，政府對此邊疆事件，接獲報告否？是否會予注意？又在此期間，是否會就此事，作外交上之交涉，詳情如何？（五）外蒙軍侵入新疆之前，是否邊疆上曾發生事件，致爲外蒙藉口，或外蒙方面另有藉口，其內容如何？（六）外蒙軍侵入新疆與當地少數民族有無勾結。在外蒙軍侵佔之地區內，人民對外蒙軍態度如何？（七）阿山區我駐軍，是否僅作抵抗？是否亦準備收復失土？外蒙軍如繼續侵入，政府將採何種辦法，以制止之。（八）新疆，尤其阿山區駐軍，實力如何，是否有制止外蒙軍繼續侵入之足夠力量？政府是否準備派兵增援？（九）外蒙軍如繼續侵入，是否將引起我政府對外蒙宣戰之考慮？</p>
<p>主席召見張羣劉斐　埀詢蒙軍侵新事件</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕蔣主席十一日下午八時邀行政院長張羣共進晚餐，十時召見參謀次長劉斐，就外蒙軍侵入新疆事，均有所垂詢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕我方將派大員赴新疆調查，相繼處理，惟人選尚未確定，可能爲外交或國防方面之高級負責人員，人選一二日即可決定。聞蔣主席定十二日召見白崇禧，將有所垂詢。十一日晨國民黨舉行中常會時，臨時決定邀請外長王世杰列席報告。王於簡錄口述事件經過後稱，關於此事之報告，係自國防部方面獲悉，對此事之處理，當本外交方式解決，由政府提出抗議，並將派員前往實際調查。惟外部發言人就此事答覆記者詢問時，則持極審愼之態度。出席十一日下午新聞局記者招待會者爲外部情報司長張沅長，據謂葉次長因公不克出席，故由渠代表。記者事先曾就外蒙軍入侵問題提出有關國防外交之問題九項，張均避免正面作答。另據記者探悉，我對蘇聯及外蒙之抗議已由外部提出，對蘇係抗議蘇機轟炸事。外交當局與蘇大使館亦有接觸，蘇大使館參贊費德林柯，十一日晨曾訪我外部葉次長等。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕政府負責人士今日宣稱，外蒙古軍隊攻擊新疆之北塔鎭，起因於上次邊界糾紛中被中國軍隊捕獲之八個蒙古兵之釋放問題。外蒙古軍隊在空軍支援下，於四十八小時之最後通牒終止後，進攻北塔。蒙古軍司令官曾稱，除非被俘之八個蒙古兵立即獲釋，渠即將採用武力，事後即自陸空兩路進攻。聞北塔駐軍司令，曾提議與外蒙方面進行談判，但未成立和平解決辦法。</p>
<h3>立法院今開例會　新籍立委將提臨時動議　建議政府採取強硬外交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立法院十二日舉行三二七次會議時，新疆籍立委廣錄，華聲慕等，將就蘇機掩護外蒙軍入寇新疆事，提出臨時動議，建議當局對此事取強硬態度。廣錄等十一日晨接見記者，發表彼等對此事之感想，認此次事件之發生，爲在意料中者。同時指出今日新疆局面，民族問題並不嚴重，值得注意者，爲國際關係。同時，新疆事件可與今日之內外蒙，東北問題等　齊觀，蓋上述各地所發生之問題，有其共同性也。新疆人士於伊寗事件發生後，主張政府對蘇聯態度應強硬，並向聯合國安全理事會控訴，以引起國際之注意。今日仍主採強硬外交。</p>
<h3>首都人士震愕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕蘇機掩護外蒙軍入侵新疆消息發表後，首都人士極表震愕。各報咸以第一條地位，予以刋載，且有配以地圖，促起國人注意者。平日極爲冷落之蘇使館今亦成記者採訪對象。記者十一日分訪熟悉邊情人士，探詢彼等對此事之看法，僉認外蒙軍在蘇機掩護下侵入我國境達六百華里，現距奇台僅三百餘華里，若再入侵，進至七角井等地，則天山北路勢將被其切斷，迪化與哈密（亦即新疆與內地）間即無法聯繫。因之事態發展，實不容我人忽視。至此次事件發生之原因，彼等咸認此事不無國際因素在內，故衆認依循外交途徑解決或亦爲一種有效辦法。談及此事近因，據某週前甫自迪化來京之新疆人士告記者，稱此次事件發生，係由於在外力支持下之達利勒漢陰謀所引起。達利勒漢爲哈　倭族人，和平條文簽訂前，活躍外蒙及阿山區毗連地帶。新局和平解決，外蒙軍撤走，政府發表阿斯滿爲阿山區專員，達即在某方慫恿下多方作祟，致阿斯滿幾無法接事，客冬阿山區突來僞裝爲「伊寗」軍之騎兵三千人，助達進攻阿斯滿，戰事時斷時續，最近外蒙軍在蘇機掩護下猛攻，事態乃見擴大。此　蒙軍在和平條款簽訂前，曾盤踞阿山區，故對該區地形極熟悉。</p>
<h3>蘇使館無表示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕蘇使館方面，十一日對新疆事拒絕有所批評。據謂，此事僅自報端閱悉，在獲知詳情前，恕不評論。對我提出抗議事，使館方面亦不作任何批評。</p>
<h3>未接正式報告　美官方表緘默</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十日電〕關於南京消息所稱外蒙古軍隊在蘇聯飛機掩護下，侵入中國境內一節，頃據此間負責人士談稱，美國國務院對此，不十分重視。截至目前爲止，美國國務院尚未接獲正式報告。美國政府於上月內曾迭次接獲此種類似之消息，其中亦有來自中國政府者，但均未能證實。</p>
<h3>蒙軍攻疆消息　美報顯著刊登</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十日電〕此間晚報咸以首頁地位，刊載南京發出外蒙軍隊入侵新疆之報道。紐約太陽報之標題。爲「外蒙軍隊進犯中國，外蒙共和國之部隊，以蘇聯飛機掩護，突入新疆。該報係採用美聯社根據中央通訊社之消息所發之報道，內謂：「茲證實外蒙部隊本月五日午在蘇聯標幟飛機四架掩護之下，侵入新疆」。美聯社稱，據某軍事觀察家謂，由於距離遼遠，復缺乏立可調動之兵力，故中央政府似不致調充分之防衛部隊，開往新疆。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕國民外交協會上海分會，定今日邀約各界領袖，就新疆事件發生後我國應有對策，交換意見。該會對此將作重要表示。</p>
<h3>張伯苓返津</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津十一日電〕張伯苓十一日由滬飛平，當日下午返津。對外蒙入侵，張氏感慨不已，謂國人如人人有愛國心，中國就是世界第一強國，現在一切情形，都由於大家愛國心太差，但余並不悲觀，余仍將竭盡所能致力敎育。</p>
<h3>新疆省奇台區　產原子彈原料</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕據政府某高級官員稱：新疆奇台區，有製造原子彈之原料鈾鑛。</p>
<h3>美國貸款限期　我將籲請展延</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十一日廣播：中國現仍抱有希望自美國獲得大規模之經濟援助，預料中國將　請美國展延對華貸款之限期（六月三十日）現距限期不足三星期，中國政府尚未向進出口銀行申請五億元借款之任何部分。</p>
<h3>洪蘭友遞補　中政委缺額</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕國民黨中常會，十一日上午舉行第七十二次會議，出席委員鄒魯，孫科，于右任，居正等卅六人，李宗黃主席，首由王外長世杰報告外蒙軍隊侵入新疆問題，旋進行議程，通過各要案如次：（一）撤銷東北黨務指導委會，（二）加派林瑞靈爲中央婦女指導委員會委員，（三）青海省黨部主任委員馬步芳請辭主任委員兼職照准，遺缺以馬紹武繼任，（四）中央政治委會委員柏文蔚逝世，遺缺推洪蘭友補充</p>
<h3>葡殖民部長竟稱　不流血不還澳門</h3>
<p>〔合衆社里斯本十一日電〕葡萄牙殖民部長杜惡　十一日接見澳門代表團時宣稱：葡萄牙如不在澳門便地流血，決不以澳門歸還中國。葡萄牙將採取措置，以校正澳門人民所不同意之任何葡萄牙法律。杜氏並謂：同樣，渠確信葡萄牙仍將居留印度，數千名白種及有色葡人，如不在印度爲保衛而戰鬥，葡國國旗決不在印度卸下。渠深信在印度之變動中，葡萄牙在印度之主權，仍可安然無憂。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕十一日新聞局記者會中，有詢以「中國對於收回澳門一事，已正式向葡萄牙政府交涉否」？外交部情報司長張沅長答稱：關於此事，「無可奉告」。</p>
<h3>經濟改革方案　首重減少差額　徵財產稅辦法草擬中</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕行政院新聞局十一日下午四時半舉行記者招待會，董顯光局長答覆記者詢問如下：</p>
<p>問，據傳，此次拘捕事件，張院長及政府其他文官對經過情形並不知悉，董局長對此有何意見？</p>
<p>答，最近之拘捕，係根據國府五月十九日所公布之維持社會秩序辦法第五條規定，授權地方當局，在緊急時會，爲維持社會秩序及公共治安，得採取有效之制止措置，各地執行此項命令情形，事後均詳細報告中央，所傳張院長及其他文官並未知悉，實屬無據。</p>
<p>問，擬議中之財產稅，能詳示其性質及要點否？估計財產將根據何種原則，此項財產對於各種財產是否一律適用？</p>
<p>答，政府正在草擬徵收財產稅之辦法，估計財產及財產分類之原則，尚在研究中。</p>
<h3>切實和平方案　政府均所歡迎</h3>
<p>問，政府對於參政會草擬之和平方案，採取何種態度？政府願否接受參政會之建議？放棄任何先決條件，而與共黨重開談判？</p>
<p>答，本人願再提醒各位，政府從未關閉和平談判之門，對於任何切實可行之和平方案，均所歡迎。參政會和平建議，中共經其宣傳機構業已表示拒絕，六月五日共黨新華社之廣播，指責整個參政會爲一支持「內戰」之反動團體，且謂參政會之和平呼籲全係虛僞，共黨之態度，足以說明國內衝突之責任應由何方負之。</p>
<p>問，張院長之經濟改革新方案，外界頗多臆測，能將該方案之實在情形及目前狀態作詳細之解釋否？張院長之經濟改革新方案，其詳情如何？</p>
<p>答，張院長所提出之經濟改革方案，目的在平衡國家預算，首　減少差額，促進生產及增加稅收，該方案未經國務會議通過之前，未便以詳細內容奉告。全國經濟委會昨日舉行之會議，對於如何迅速出售國營事業及敵僞產業之辦法，有若干決定，人民得用美金庫劵購買政府指定出售之國營事業及敵僞產業之全部或一部。分　與民營之某項國營事業，倘承辦人認購半數以上股額，政府即可將該項企業先行交付承辦人經營，其餘之股額，由政府暫行保有及繼續讓售。</p>
<p>東北方面共軍　改採陣地戰術</p>
<p>問，東北目前軍事情勢之展望如何？</p>
<p>答，在長春，四平街及瀋陽局　共軍之進　國軍，已改變其歷來之流動游擊戰術，而作陣地戰，此爲共軍作戰方法之空前轉變，各位或能憶及共軍曾三次企圖竄犯松花江南岸，均於四月下旬遭遇慘重損失，狼狽敗退。今竟能於短時期內迅速整補完成，並携來較前更爲精良及新式武器，再度大舉進攻，殊堪注意。</p>
<h3>對日和約問題　我政府研究中</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕新聞局記者招待會中，外部情報司長張沅長曾答覆外交詢問如下：</p>
<p>問，對於最近日本新任首相所提有關琉球羣島之　求，中國政府之態度如何？</p>
<p>答，整個對日各約問題，已在我政府研究之中，但目前本人不　對此一事，加以評論。</p>
<p>問，本月七日大剛報對越南問題之社評，係反映中國政府之意見否？有謂越南國民黨「當然受中國之支持」，未悉確否？若然，則在何方面受中國支持，亦請見告。</p>
<p>答，今日中國政府並不支持越南任何黨派。</p>
<p>問，據新聞界報道，有「某國」之若干漁船，業被扣留營口港內，可否請予證實，或予否認，國際公法或中國法律上有無任何條文，規定外國船隻，進入中國領海時，應予扣留？</p>
<p>答，關於此項報道，本人並無消息。</p>
<p>問，中國政府所派之旅大視察團，已有任何報告前來否？如已收致報告，請將該團受當地人民及當局（蘇聯及地方當局）之接待情形見告。</p>
<p>答，旅大視察團到達旅順，已約一星期，但尚未往大連，目下視察工作在進行中，外部尚未接到詳細報告。</p>
<p>問，中國政府對於目前匈牙利局勢之態度如何？</p>
<p>答，匈牙利方面現無中國外交代表，但匈牙利局勢，則在我政府密切注視之中。</p>
<h3>張君勱應邀晋京　徐傳霖下週初就任府委</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕當局對新疆事件處理頗爲愼重，日內約各黨首領共商，張君勱氏已應最高當局邀於昨夜搭車晋京。記者昨晤張氏，詢以對此事件之看法，答謂：問題性質嚴重，未作研究前，不敢輕於置答，此事應先作詳細調查。詢以所謂憲法統一解釋之內容，張氏表示：例如我國之政治制度，究爲總統制度或責任內閣制，應有統一之解釋。又憲法之其他條文，亦不能以一黨之觀點解釋。關於外傳三黨共同施政方針中第三條將加刪除一節，張氏表示未有所聞。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨徐傳霖氏，定下週初晋京，就任國府委員職。</p>
<h3>國府委會將設　政經法制三會　主委人選正在遴商中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕國民政府委員會將設政治委會，經濟委會及法制委會，主委人選正遴商中，此係由於改組後之國府委會每兩週舉行國務會議一次，商討施政方針，軍政大計，立法原則，處理財政計劃及國家各部門之總預算與追加等重要政務議案過多，不及處理，而若干案件必須事先加以審查者，亦難於詳加研究，根據國府委會會議規程之規定，各種提案得交付分組審查委會審議，現爲應實際需要，決常設三個委會，政治委會負責處理內政·外交·交通·敎育等案件。經濟委會負責處理財政·經濟·金融·糧食·農林等案件。法制委會負責處理各項法規及立法原則等案件。據悉：各委會主委人選，可能爲政治委會主委陳布富，經濟委會邵力子，法制委會王寵惠。</p>
<h3>獨立未滿兩年的外蒙</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>脫離中國而獨立尚未滿兩年的外蒙，已出兵侵入了中國的版圖。新疆的政治和外交的情形，本極錯綜複雜，自伊寗事變發生後，政府費了很大的心力，才把他安排好。如今外蒙軍隊侵入新疆，當然是有所企圖。外蒙，這一塊廣　達六十餘萬平方哩的土地，列入中國的版圖，已經有二千多年，但二者之間的關係，始終沒有明確地說明。到遜清嘉慶年間，曾經草訂了冗長的條文，中蒙的關係才正式確定。它雖然祗是嘉慶皇帝片面的昭示，但極爲蒙古人所重視，成爲一件具有國際效力的文件。光緒以後，清廷治蒙政策，未愜人意。同時帝俄勾引活佛，慫恿抗治，於是漸有煥散的現象。</p>
<p>外蒙雖是遠處塞外的漠野，但是一片天然的大收塲，肉食和皮毛之豐富，無與倫比，而地廣人稀，有高度發展的希望。因此，便引起了帝俄的覬覦。其後帝俄經營西伯利亞，　設中東鐵路，並對外蒙煽惑其獨立。</p>
<p>當蘇聯的革命第一階段完成後，對於蒙古漸漸取沙皇態度而代之。首先，確立了他的行政系統，把汗旗盟改爲愛馬克，賀旬，司蒙，巴克，阿爾班等的新行政制度，施行了適合於遊牧社會的新經濟政策，把蒙古一切都蘇聯化起來。又供給現代化的武器，訓練蒙古的軍隊，在一九三六年蒙軍和日「滿」軍隊的邊境衝突時，蘇維埃軍隊又進入了蒙古。</p>
<p>在日本投降的前夕，中蘇兩國在莫斯科簽訂友好協定，決定外蒙在大戰結束後，由公民投票來決定其獨立與否。這是根據國父扶植弱小民族的原則。那年十一月，內次雷法章等飛赴庫倫，參觀公民投票選舉，去年一月五日，政府正式承認外蒙的獨立。</p>
<p>新疆是我國西北的外實庫，氣候溫和，物產豐富，遠在東北之上。過去新疆因地理及外交之影響，造成極微妙之地位，如今正在刷新政治，安撫各族的時候，而最近又任命麥斯武德爲新省主席，更是向善隣安民之途邁進。此次突然發生外蒙騎兵侵入白塔山的驚人事件，實和我國承認外蒙獨立的願望相去甚遠，不勝令人扼惋！</p>
<p>蒙古和新疆，在地理形勢上，阿爾泰山自西北向東南綿延，西北高峻而東南山坡低緩。由扎克薩而至準噶爾部，一片平沙，無可　守。遊牧民族，生活其間，日馳數百里，視爲常事。故一旦新疆有事，易受外蒙所挾制，是值得重視的。</p>
<p>過去喬治亞，亞美利亞，阿色貝加，以及立陶宛，拉脫維亞和愛沙尼亞的命運，是怎樣決定的，歷史已告訴了我們。如今蒙軍的侵入新疆，其前途演變，實更值得國人重視。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>外蒙軍隊侵入新疆事件</h3>
<p>連日中外電訊報道：外蒙騎兵一營，配合軍用汽車輕重武器，在據稱誚飾有蘇聯標誌之飛機掩護下，於本月五日，開始侵入新疆奇台東北三百五十里之白塔山，我防軍以守土有責，已予抵抗，戰事正在進行中。又悉外蒙騎兵已楔入我國境六百華重，附近城鈸更慘遭轟炸，軍民頗有死傷：我外交當局，已經由蘇聯大使彼特羅夫向外蒙古政府提出抗議。這在歐亞局勢動盪不安的今天，我國新疆邊境，又突傳嚴重的警號，自然値得我們深切的注意。</p>
<p>新疆古稱西域，全省四面環以高山，天山橫亙其間。就全部形勢論之。可以東扞長城，北蔽蒙古，南述衛藏，西倚葱徹以為固，居神州大陸之脊，勢若高屋之建領。固則屛衛中國，鞏我藩籬；不固則關隴隘其封，河湟失其險，一舉足而中原為之動搖，是故漢取三十六國以斷匈奴右臂，唐開安西北庭以制諸蕃。胡元崛起金山，奄取西域，卒滅宋金而有天下。明代控馭弗及，瓦刺數寇，而河套以亡，當淸季乾隆盛世，征伐準回二部，土地延袤歡萬里，厥後英俄力加經略，新疆四周部落，若布魯特，浩罕，安杲延，哈薩克，布哈爾等，不獨名都易姓，且潛力所伏，西陲多憂。外蒙與新疆戈壁，犬牙相錯；自民國十年庫倫失守後，外蒙組府，唐努烏梁海獨立，從此北疆藩籬盡失，危如纍卵，幸廿年以來，中蒙相安無事。此次外蒙突興兵入侵新疆邊境，似為有計劃之行動；前途演變如何，我們不願作過早的論斷：惟此一不幸事件之發生，隱患堪虞，我們撫今思昔，實在難安緘默。</p>
<p>一，外蒙軍之侵入係在北疆阿山區，十餘年的新疆事變，無一次不起於阿山：此次與往昔『民變』不同的，為外蒙軍有計劃的入侵，非單純的新疆內部民族問題，所可同日而語。按阿山為新疆東北部第五行政區，區治設承化，卽古承化寺；地當阿爾泰山之南，西接蘇聯，東通外蒙，南達迪化，為北疆邊境重鎮。阿山區面積遼闊，礦產豐富，人口六三·〇四〇人，哈薩克族佔五三·三五二人。當哈薩克族發生變亂時，曾多次竄擾木壘河，奇台，孚遠，阜康，乾德等處，以致動搖迪化。卅四年五月事變，亂民佔據承化，八月佔塔城之亂民更蜂擁而來；阿山區各縣被刧一空；人民紛逃第一區之奇台等處，阿山行政專員區署本設承化，因受外力壓迫，今年四月中旬退往白塔山。據此，則阿山區似早已形勢危殆，此次外蒙軍的進攻，如不阻止，必兵禍延及於整個北疆，那就構成嚴重的問題了。</p>
<p>二，外蒙原為我國漠北地方，民國十年庫倫失守後，受人煽惑，僭稱獨立，受帝俄之保護。俄國革命後，外蒙一度取消獨立，歸服我國，未幾又醞釀獨立，自立「蒙古國共和政府一，受蘇聯的保護指導。一九四五年八月十四日中蘇簽立「中蘇友好同盟條約」，我國為顧全蘇聯友誼，乃與蘇聯交換照會，確定外蒙在日本戰敗後，依公民投票證實其獨立願望時，卽承認其獨立。一九四六年一月十五日我政府正式承認外蒙國獨立，惟迄今尙未建立外交爾係。外蒙在形式上是政治獨立，其軍事外交，原受「蘇蒙議定書」的拘束，所以外蒙軍的行動和發展，因蘇聯關係的參與其間，是値得重視的。</p>
<p>三，中蘇關係以「中蘇友好同盟條約」為基礎，數年以來，我們正望中蘇關係，能因此新基礎而好轉。依該項條約精神，蘇聯本會聲明無干涉中國內政之意。年來新疆內部若干紛亂，前任省主席張治中，處置合理，蘇聯態度亦無可議。此次外蒙軍入侵北疆，無論從中蘇關係，或蘇蒙關係上說，都是很不幸的事件。就蘇聯說，蘇聯應就正當途徑，阻止外蒙軍入侵新疆的行動，以免事態擴大：就中國說，中國政府應有理智的運用，作當機立斷的處置，在外交上和行動上，阻止外蒙軍的深入。現在的事態尙無更深的發展，已侵入北疆六百華里之外蒙軍，應及早退出，以維持中蒙關係的友善。</p>
<p>同時我們認為在新疆地方當局朱詳確報道眞相以前，我們各方面對於此次不幸事件，不應有感情的過份衝動。我們必須冷靜，信任政府能有必要的措施，循正當的途徑以阻止外蒙軍的行動。</p>

<h3>針織業糾紛調解未成　男女工三百包圍警局　周學湘趕來保出被拘七代表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第一二三區針織業勞資雙方因指數糾紛，日前社會局一度召集雙方調解未成，昨日下午再召集雙方談判，緣該業去年因營業清淡，經商定每月依上月份生活指數八五折計算。自二月起指數凍結後，照實發給，但差金仍有折扣，七萬三千時發二萬，十一萬時發三萬二千。並規定指數解凍後如超過一萬二千倍，仍恢復八五折之折扣。該項協議實行至本年八月底終止。今生活指數解凍。工人認為依照協議吃虧太甚，無法維持生活，乃要求依一萬四千八百倍計算，資方不允。昨日談判時工人讓步至一萬四千倍再打八五折，資方仍不允，談判乃成僵局。當調解時，針織等男女工三百餘人至社會局聽候消息，該局認為有聚眾威脅嫌疑，命工人退出，否則不予調解。一面通知嵩山警分局派警到場維持秩序。工人退至局外後，談判仍無結果，工人因此惶躁不安，工會代表亦無法勸阻。警局乃將勞方代表一區工會湯寒白，徐觀南·陳甫生·錢錦康，二區　芳雄·郁統聚　三區李鼎等七人帶往警局。一面傳訊資方代表，工人見代表被帶走，遂一齊趕至警局。警局則出動警備車及大批軍警維持秩序。工人包圍警局，歷久不散，後經總工會周學湘趕到，向警局將七名工人保釋。勞資糾紛未了事宜，待今日再在社會局商談。工人乃於深夜十二時許散去。</p>
<p>據社會局吳局長稱，勞資商談時，代表名額規定，不能聚眾威脅，否則不予調解，並當依法嚴辦，如工會領導無方，則必要時將解散工會。</p>
<h3>指數糾紛　幾難指數　荳腐絕跡　餓出病來　陸司長訪社會局長商議對策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕因生活指數引起之勞資糾紛，蔓延不絕，社會部陸司長京士昨日下午特在訪社會局吳局長，對此問題商謀對策。據勞工處調解科長樊振邦稱：一部份資方未經與勞方協商階段，或勞方要求協商而置之不理，逕由同業公會通知各會員，概先以一萬四千八百倍發給，因而引起工人不滿，邀起罷工怠工等行為，亦為糾紛主因之一，工人有罷工怠工行為，政府自當予以適當處置。</p>
<p>豆腐業工人因要求按生活指數發薪，資方予以拒絕。工人乃於七日發動罷工。當日且有數家豆腐店因工人未罷工而被搗毀，工人三名因此被警局以煽動工潮嫌疑逮捕。一部份資方仍自行維持工作，相持二日，至昨日被迫停業，各菜場均無荳腐可買。昨經社會局勸解，工人可鑒於今日復工，工資問題再由社會局於日內進行調解。</p>
<p>南市九昌織造廠一百八十餘工人為指數糾紛「餓工」事，至昨日已有男女工三人因餓致病，經社會局派員勸道將病人送醫治，並煮粥購買麵包勸工人進食，日內再進行調解。</p>
<p>陽傘筆墨罷工怠工</p>
<p>陽傘業職工因資方通告正派代表向中央情願，暫依四月份指數發給工資，工人於是罷工。筆墨文具業墨組及水筆組工人，昨日亦有一部份怠工。</p>
<p>七手帕廠昨起怠工</p>
<p>手帕業各廠亦因資方不允依五月份指數發薪，致有統一，中國，華強等七家昨起怠工。三區染坊織工會手帕組定於今日下午二時開會，商討解決辦法，一面勸導工人先行復工。</p>
<p>機器業再度起糾紛</p>
<p>機器工業同業公會近又通知廠一律按一萬四千八百倍暫予發給，遂再度引起勞方不滿，發生糾紛。昨日下午工人推派代表至社會局情願。</p>
<p>安泰職工包圍廠方</p>
<p>西康路安泰鐵工廠二百餘職工因指數糾紛，於昨晨罷工並包圍廠方，經警備部派員到廠維持秩序，社會局亦派員前往勸道，工人於下午復工，聽候調解。</p>

<h3>兩路採用　購票次序證　防止黃牛活躍　每日換色一種</h3>

<h3>中美無綫電話費　三分鐘十二美元　七月一日可望開始正式通話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市與國際及國內之電信交通，由於新式機器設備之應用，已日趨發達而便利。國際無綫電台，經行政院之核准，向美購買最新式之「單綫電話機」，業於最近運抵本市。該電台現正積極進行開班中美無綫電話及中菲無綫電話業務，前者已試話數次，成績甚佳，後者亦正在試騐中，約定於七月一日開始正式通話，屆時將與上海電話公司聯絡，凡通話之市民不必親赴電台，即可在林頭權側，悠然撥起話筒，與遠隔重洋之親友通話，宛如晤言一室。至於中美通話費用，據悉約每三分鐘美金十二元，以法定匯率折合，實收國幣十四萬餘元。</p>
<p>鍵盤自動上落</p>
<p>又國際無綫電台利用美軍剩餘物資中之「五組式」無綫電打字電報機，開辦無綫電打字電報以來，本市與國際同之電報往來，在滬收速度上及錯誤避免上，均已有顯著之成績。記者昨往該電台參觀，該項電報機現有三具，其中兩具一與RCA無綫電交通公司聯絡，一與要開無綫電公司聯絡，收發商電及私電，另一架則供新聞電之收發，每架電報機包括收報與發報兩部份，其構造甚為複雜。收報部份當舊金山方面發出電報時，此間打字機之鍵盤即自動上落而將原文打出，取下後立即可遞送綫人，不必經過抄錄之手續。</p>
<p>研究擴充設備</p>
<p>發報時則先將原文用打字機打於闊約半英吋之紙帶上，此種打字機與普通不同，其字鍵上有數量不同排列不同之細微針頭，因此紙帶上不同之字母即有不同之孔眼，將此紙帶裝於發報機上，開動機器，由於不同之孔眼，發出不同之電波，使舊金山方面收報機上之鍵　上落，打出原文。此項無綫電打字電報開辦未久，國際電台尙在研究如何增加效率並擴充設備。據悉：環球無綫電公司最近亦擬與國際電台聯絡，辦理無綫電打字電報業務，惟該公司之報機式　為「六組式」，與RCA等之「五組式」微有不同。該項機器，已有一架於前晚在南京試騐，與美國加利福尼亞之文多拉城通報，另有七架現尙存於海關，其中一部份將售與國際電台，一部份將售與上海電信局開辦上海·天津·南京·廣州問之無綫電打字電報云。</p>
<p>國際無綫電台打字電報　準確迅速均有顯著成績</p>

<h3>為外銷絲開闢生路　將向美易人造絲　生絲一磅可易人造絲六至八磅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次政府舉辦繭貸二千五百億元，計劃　製外銷絲三萬担，或以根據日前生產成本，該項外銷絲，每担價格需遠二千五百萬至三千萬元之讀。而我國生絲唯一去路之美國市塲，目前生絲市價每磅不過四元四五角。照官價外匯折合，每担僅達七百餘萬元，相去過遠，出口成本不數太鉅。且更以美國目前生絲過剩，而日本且有廉價生絲供應，故頗有爲該項外鈉絲前途杞憂者。惟據某關係方面指出：該批外銷生絲，實爲曰獲取外匯之唯一資源。目前外銷成本固不合，惟可改變方式，以我所產生絲三分之一，易取美國之人造絲，即可以低價之人造絲，供給國內全年耗用。緣美國市價，生絲每磅四元四角，而人造絲每磅僅六角至九角。故在美生絲一磅，可折合人造絲六磅至八磅。而以目前國內之市價計算，生絲每磅折合法幣二十萬元，人造絲每磅折合九萬元，生絲與人造絲相差不過一倍。故如能以生絲輸美，以易美之人造絲，其裨益於我國者，實尤過於僅將輸出生絲，爭取外匯之一途云。</p>
<h3>賣風籠罩市場　食米價節節報低　北市高白粳三十六萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕週來米價逐日下跌，昨又挫落一二萬元。船戶因日前大雨，恐有潮性蒸發，脫售心切，市塲遂有賣風籠罩，形成供過於求局面。加以產價報低，欲振乏力，人心虛軟，卒呈萎靡局面。昨南北到米共五千六百餘石，高白粳北市跌至卅六萬元，南市則爲卅八萬元。薄稻南市卅八萬五千元，北市卅八萬元。</p>
<p>本月初，食米價格飛昇，一度逼近五十萬關。經當局積極設法疏通來源，嚴禁囤積，一面並舉辦，工廠學校團體配米，及貧民平糶，人心安定。加以　爭已臨，食米易出蟲霉爛，各食戶儲量　祇以足食爲限，停止囤藏，執貨者亦多求售，因而人心向下。據一般觀測，米價如不再有大刺激，可有相當時期穩定。</p>
<p>麵粉漢口有到，市化淸閒，本粉續低三五千元，洋粉帶疲，麩皮再挫一二千元。豆餅實消仍懈，步削一二千元。黃豆供過於求，去胃甚稀，猛跌五六千至萬元。彔豆巓主難覓，一蹶不振，再跌五六千元。赤豆疲中徘徊，步跌三五千元。紅糧漢口來貨接連，續疲三四千元。苞米交淡少神，芝蔴到銷兩細，暫無榮辱。生仁華南報胃淸淡，本街看望不前，在跌萬元。</p>
<p>新蠶豆客帮不動，本街另化有限，逐步下游。長江各埠浙省近處，來貨漸湧，繼續猛挫三五千至萬元，形勢仍難生色。油市以廣方略進，生油豆油淸油均見微挺萬元，小車蔴油飛升三四萬元</p>
<p>新小麥到貨略有，粉廠擯而不開，仍在回跌之中，而粉市江河日下，廠方須跌至十二萬元，或可成交，大約再須數天，方能做開。</p>
<h3>四區麺粉業公會　昨開會員大會</h3>

<h3>細紗走銷不佳</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因漢口等地有簡化禁運紗布之辦法，粤漢兩帮相繼進取，市續上揚，廿支雙馬紗最高做至七百八十萬元，四二支藍鳳亦高至一千二百六十萬元。嗣有申新廠開售雙馬紗一百餘包，價爲七百七十萬元，同時售出天女金雙鷄等牌紗甚多，市勢突吿下挫。最後四二支藍鳳價爲一千二百廿五萬元，比上日軋降十五萬元，廿支特變馬八百五十五萬元，上漲十萬元，雙馬紗七百七十二萬，亦升十七萬元。全日趨勢細紗走銷不佳，市挫。廿支紗因布市挺俏而帶堅，十六支紗以毛巾被單等棉織廠有納，市情　翔。</p>
<h3>皂燭火柴原料　燒碱牛皮粉膠俱漲</h3>
<p>皂燭原料交易不惡，各方均有採辦，市盤遂造俏。月牌燒碱每桶做高至七百二十萬元，軋漲二十萬元。美貨燒碱銷路淸淡，市鮮上落，泡化碱每磅上升一千元，爲二千三百元。司的令現貨不懸，市需殷切，致供不敷求，每担猛漲四十萬元，爲三百四十萬元。其餘椰子及香草油松香等穩定。</p>
<p>火柴原料，邇因當局有核准寬放輸入原料限額之訊，各廠咸抱觀望，無意進取，市趨疲軟。氯酸鉀每噸跌至二千九百萬元，狂挫二百萬元。硫磺化亦小廿萬元，氯化鋅價做二千八百萬，亦降二百萬元。琥珀下挫五十萬元，其餘赤磷及百磅牛皮紙，二六磅藍紙，三五磅綠包紙，價均下瀉。市上獨牛皮粉膠現貨甚缺，需求暢盛，每噸（五％）價高至三千萬元，猛漲五百萬元。二氧化錳及細玻璃粉平定。</p>

<h3>實銷清淡　價無上落</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲一二〇號旭了開盤一千七百五十萬元，盤旋甚久，六十萬元有成交。中午收盤喊八十萬元元賣出，終因實銷甚淸，下午最後喊五十萬元有人要，六十萬元賣出，結果與上日價軋平。一五〇號有光，市上存貨極少，昨做開斯尼亞牌子價一千九百萬元。</p>
<p>昨市廠經趨勢甚疲，終因賣多於買，喊價一致軟落，做開B字等級五担，價做二千四百四十萬元，係同章買進。其餘各級，俱未聞成交，干經五担單子貨，昨亦有成交，價一千七百六十萬元。另担討價一千七百萬元，比上日短四五十萬元之譜。</p>

<h3>華股市况仍恍惚　現遞永紗時呈倒掛之象　二成美券證金又有轉緩希望　所方與經紀人聯合晋京請願</h3>
<p>華股昨依然十分恍惚，掉期迫在目前。且下週起遞交二成證金，須繳納美金債劵，是否有通融餘地，尙未敢卜，散戶逐在遞交中結束。一部份大戶則力購現水紗，營業上有一大轉變，過程遂由低而屢升，現遞永紗且時呈倒掛之象。新疆事件，人心雖有不同之觀測，惟因環境不利，終以看疲者較爲濃厚。晨開低盤，開後遞永紗自五二〇〇元低價，有一〇四號一五七號一七九號進至五四〇〇元。二二三號九七號六五號七二號八五號尙售，退爲五二六〇元。一〇三號一九號一七七號六〇號一〇六號七六號進至五四〇〇元。八四號一〇二號九七號一八五號二三五號二二四號不時供給，降至五三〇〇元內。一八〇號八九號六一號一五二號五〇號二二三號一一七號俱納，一五七號二三一號力納現永紗，乃將遞永紗拉高至五五五〇元以上。一〇二號一〇七號九一號六五號八三號脫手降至五三八〇元。二八號一五三號二三號二〇四號一五二號趁低買進。傳二成美劵證金事又有轉緩希望，證交與經紀人公會代表有聯合請願消息，買意尙殷，再回升至五五〇〇元外。一六號二九號二二四號脫手不已，二三五號八號三六號一八五號九四號雖進，商務亦由一八三號掛高至漲停。但五五〇〇元外終維持久，臨收前又退入五四〇〇元內。二三一號對現永紗力加扶持，一〇四號亦吸納遞永紗較多，收盤復吿穩健。現永紗以五四二〇元，遞永紗以五四三〇元結束。收後一四八號二二六號賣出，曾將遞永紗迫低至五三八〇元以下，但散買仍殷，最後仍喊高至五四三〇元以上。結果較前收計即交股永紗尙平，華豐新光信和永公景福新勤興微銼，中法跌半成，商務獨吿漲達限度，大通景綸五和麗安新亞微降，國貨中絲跌半成，火柴內衣中紡榮豐微升。號交計永紗景福新光微挫。永公華豐信和跌半成，塲外各股尙見徽降。</p>
<h3>統債不振　外股盤低</h3>
<p>公債昨人心不振，環境不利。統丙晨開六五〇〇元，已見低落。三六〇室二三〇室賣出，自六八〇〇元起盤低至五八〇〇元。紗花帮及五〇三室有納，最後在六四〇〇元左右徘徊。結果較前收計甲乙丁各低八百元，丙戊跌落一千三，成交約五六百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨仍少維持，證劵帮賣意不斷，而合盛亦有脫手，散買無法抵抗，人心仍在時局關係中見怯。怡紗自晨開五九〇〇〇元起，盤低至五五〇〇〇元內結束，結果較前收計怡紗會德豐紙業各跌半成強迄一成不到，英聯業廣怡啤航業微挫至半成弱，鋼業獨平。</p>
<h3>紡建在各地收棉　已達百四十萬担</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司爲提倡利用國棉，曾積極於全國各產棉區，分設收棉據點，進行收購工作。聞自去年九十月間，新棉登塲時起，迄目前爲止，該公司已在東北，天津，靑島，西安，鄭州，漢口，沙市，南通，嘉定等區，收購國棉共達一百四十萬担。目前棉花已近落令季節，故本年度收購時期，不過尙餘一月。聞所收之花，以西安之品質最佳，次爲鄭州，漢口等地云。</p>
<h3>銀根緊縮　市價因降</h3>
<p>又訊：棉花市價近因棉紗銷路清談，紗廠納胃轉懈，更因六底將屆，市上銀根奇緊，內地市價亦見回降，今市成交不多，趨勢平疲。午樣同業略有做開，計沙市花八二件，價一四七五，〇〇〇元，漢口細絨一〇〇件，價一二九萬，冲通五〇担，每担價一一二萬，以上均爲棧交價。又為寳花因價格較高，本帮紗廠均無進意，塲中僅無錫小型廠成交四十件，價一五二萬元。</p>
<h3>公司連續派貨　捲烟漲勢受挫</h3>
<p>昨日香烟市勢，初開本街續有搜求，貨主扳持不吐，行情直綫上翔，詎好景不常，旋有外埠同行在塲轉賣，市遂回軟。午後因中華公司派雙斧全祿，華明公司派「十字軍·大百萬金」，華成亦有派貨之說，漲勢頓時受挫。大英比上日回小八萬元，老刀五華脚地較硬，華商烟市仍挺秀。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕聽裝香烟，因端節迫近，禮品所需，朮銷甚旺，做價異常挺俏五十支茄力克爲五萬元，三五牌四萬二千二百元，小三砲二萬九千元。</p>
<h3>中國銀行定期　召開股東會</h3>
<p>中國銀行第二十三屆通常股東總會，定本月十四日午前九時，在該行四樓會議廳，正式舉行，董事會已通知各股東代表，於十三日前報到。據悉：此次股東大會除報吿業務及總決算外，並討論盈餘之分配。又該行本屆行務會議，自本月五月開幕以來，迄今已及一週，六日起即開始分組審查提案，昨已告一段落，今日召開第二次大會，並舉行閉幕式</p>
<h3>卅五年度陳茶　評價工作完成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅五年度陳茶，自決定由中茶聯營公司收購，開始許價以來，茲悉：評價工作，現已吿一段落。評定之各級茶價，刻正送請各茶商微詢意見中。如無異議，則即收按該項評價，進行收購，然後接洽外銷云。</p>
<p>內銷茶價堅定</p>
<p>昨日茶市，本街店莊及客帮對於內銷茶，仍有購辦，致人心不餒，成交行情難未見佳，但比前咸帶堅緊。至於津地頻加靑睞之錄茶芯，因雙方談判雜獲解決，市勢遂仍淸閒，他若外銷花色，自本市若干家華商，鑒於目前華茶輸出，漸瀕絕境，爲積極推廣起見，復起動辦後，邇來交易微見回甦，市氣亦能站住。茲悉最近汪裕泰茶號，對於去年度三帮祁門紅茶，頗有動辦之意，出價如能寬裕，恐即將有一翻熱閙耳。</p>
<h3>布價齊漲</h3>
<p>棉布市况，初開即呈挺秀。十點半漢口帮納胃進展，業中人亦來收吸，以紗布運漢解禁後，紗價上升，是以人心異常興奮，棉布貨主更爲居奇。故最後各檔細布價一致上升五千至一萬元。其餘漂布斜紋及嗶嘰元布士林等價均軋漲，自三五千元至一萬元不一。</p>
<h3>烟煤銷路呆滯</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤派貨已絡續配出，市氣難能振作，尤以豐城統鄱樂統及仁溪統，到貨充斤，銷路極爲呆滯。白煤漢口方面老　塊及焦炭來貨亦多，去胃頗受影響。然因本月份水脚調整，源華屑上海交貨鑛價反見提升，故白煤塊行市除少歟客帮急需現款，自願廉脫外，多數尙在擯持中。</p>
<h3>金山枝回升</h3>
<p>金山枝近以產價不和，號貨大都扳守，故開盤逐漸回好，前後已升一成以上。現市如元校最低須開八十六萬元，方肯允兌云。</p>
<h3>紡建售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售四九八件，全部售予廠商，申購單共二四六張云。</p>
<h3>受台幣匯率更改影響　台糖配價又調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕合糖公司因最近合幣匯率更改，故要求將台糖價格按此率調整。物價評議會食糖小組，於昨日下午召開臨時會議，決定台糖公司之十九期配糖價，較前增加百分之十六。計特號棉白每担四十六萬元。一號棉白每担四十二萬元。特號砂白每祖四十五萬元。二號砂白每担四十萬元。台灣赤砂糖每担卅七萬元。又比魯砂糖亦經限價爲每担五十二萬四千元。</p>
<h3>糖價平疲</h3>
<p>昨糖市以實銷不旺，而出戶仍多，趨勢益見平疲。公會劃盤秘魯砂初僅五十五萬八千元，旋至五十六八萬元，後爲五十六萬五千元，降五千元。二〇台中砂白四十八萬五千元，亦小五千元，三半車白初小萬元，爲五十一萬五千元，後回至五十二萬元，二四粗白小萬餘元，爲五十七萬五千元。土糖更覺不振，而成交甚稀。汕提靑三十二萬五千元，順德靑高貨三十一萬元至三十萬〇五千元，成交不及百包。興化白開四十六萬元至五萬四萬不等興赤三十二三萬元，次之三十萬元，均小萬元，成交四百簍之讀。刁靑雖呌原價，但乏受手，今日台公司配價調整，市價當有回振之望。</p>

<h3>中國境內的赤區</h3>
<p>— 凋頌西譯</p>
<p>著者爲美國Mary　Lumar　Knight日女士，在中國任通訊員甚久，大戰時期披調回美國人檢査局任要職，後又返中國擔任期刋工作六月，對於中國有相當之認議。本文載於美國讀者文摘五月號。</p>
<p>現在美國的軍隊大半業已從中國撤退，中國的共產黨將怎樣呢？他們的方針對於美國及世界和平將有什麽影響？</p>
<p>第一首先要明瞭的，就是中國的共產黨是共產主義者，他們並不是像許多美國人所誤信爲規似美國農民協進會會員，而無害於國家者。他們是堅强的狂熱者，馬列主義理想的典型人物。他們的首傾們，非爲俄人所左右，就是受訓於蘇聯者，或二者兼而有之。他們相信全世界都是趨向於共產主義的。他們的二百萬軍隊，（合游擊隊在內，）是佩帶紅星的。他們業已受了若干俄國的援助，倘予以更多之助力，則他們可能從北方的海　發動，且藉諸大城市中所有「地下工作」機構之協力，去佔領中國兵力較弱的地方。若中國赤化了，則全亞洲之成爲赤化，勢所難免！</p>
<p>俄人統治　較日人更難受</p>
<p>我到工業中心地帶潯陽及鞍出的時候，紅軍（蘇聯的及中國的）業已撤退，那時天氣還熱，我爲一國軍所打倒，並受一中國暴徒所恐嚇。我雖聲明爲美國人而予以抗議，不過他們誤以我爲俄國人，而置之不顧。</p>
<p>隨便問問老百姓，據說在俄人統治下的六個月，比在日本人統治下若干年還要難受。日本八因爲要發展滿洲的工業，至少要使許多人有工做，俄國人則不然；他們使工業的發展倒退了數十年，他們所運去的機器足抵美國每年出口機器平均數的兩倍。鞍山所有九個鐵工廠，其中六個爲他們澈底摧毀了，所餘的三個則爲中國共產黨所破壞！</p>
<p>滿洲各大城市所有一切的設備都為紅軍所破壞，以致瀋陽百萬人民無水洗澡，甚至電都幾乎沒有了。中國共產黨將鐵路破壞後，就將譏餓的南部由滿洲的產糧區截斷了，此爲以前日本人所從未爲者！他們（中共）徵募農民，將路軌枕本掘起了數百英里，甚至將開火車者之手都割了下來，使他不能開車。這是鞍山市長吿訴我的。</p>
<p>畏恨中共　甚於畏恨俄人</p>
<p>他說：「中國人民之畏恨中共，更甚於畏恨俄人，因中共更爲殘忍，甚至勸誘幼年的游擊隊員，（十歲至十二歲的男孩）去謀殺自己家裏的人！」</p>
<p>在潘陽時，一個甫投誠於國軍的中共上校吿訴我：「我以前是常常受命去迫使土匪到農村去槍刧，焚燒，强姦，無所不爲，一俟農民受盡痛苦之後，中共的軍隊始裝腔作勢地開進去，予以救濟、再設法引誘農民漸漸的相信共產主義。」。</p>
<p>中共業已踩踏了中國五萬萬人况的四分之一，及一千一百萬公方里土地的四分之一，其中大半是在中國之北方及滿洲的。整個赤區以擁有五萬人民之延安爲首都。（按其時延安尙未收復。）延安掛滿了無數印有斧頭鐮刀的紅旗，烈寗與史太林巨幅的照片，以及共產黨的口號。高級學校之課程，其大半為政治及軍事；學生之大半爲男性的靑年，正在受着充任敎員及遊擊隊首領之訓練。淪講是受嚴格束縛的。兒童在幼稚園內就授以階級門爭之歌曲，所以兒童的思想統制是在幼稚園內開始的。領袖們只許報紙刋登他們所要使人民相信的東西。他們用傳單，旗子，演說，致力於宣傳，人民的精神因此受累無窮；還有「特務」監視，不准有一反對的言論。</p>
<p>在赤區一萬三千萬人民中，不過約有一百五十萬爲黨員，至黨員之任公職者爲數不及公務員全體之半數。實則凡屬重要位置，均為他們所佔有。至於十三人所組成之政治局及其五人所組成之秘書處，則盡爲赤黨。他們現在所呼之曲調，就是今日成爲蘇聯諾附庸國昔日所呼同樣之曲調，而今則成爲赦歌矣。</p>
<p>「遠東局」　今春尚在活動</p>
<p>中國共產黨之爲第三國際會員，爲時已久，且在第三國際之遠哀局佔一重要地位，在亞洲從事於　動工作歷二十餘年者，均受有特殊的訓練，他們在印度，印度支那，及馬來亞之成就，聞然業已日有進步。</p>
<p>延安諸萬領自稱他們在一九四三年之前，早已脫離了第三國際，那就是第三國際表而上解散的時候。但是中國情報屬所獲得之文件，足以證明第三國際之遠東局在一九四七年初確是在活動着，並且影響及於全世界的共產黨，即美國的共產黨亦包含在內。至遠東局對於解決中國之內戰，除共產黨所提條件外，無論任何條件，必秘密設計以反對之，並且對於美國所努力以圖解決之任何條件，亦一律予以反對。</p>
<p>中共仍否認與第三國際或俄國政府有關係，至於對外則書使中國能得到「新民主」的福利即於心已定，並非欲使勞動階級惠政　。但是第一號的中共黨員毛澤東一九三五年在延安對該黨代表大會致詞，則謂「我們共產主義者決不隱瞞我們的政治目的，我們最後的程序是欲促進中國入於井產主義的統治。」</p>
<p>共產黨內　最有勢力份子</p>
<p>中國共產黨主席毛澤東是一又矮又肥的五十三歲的彎背者，長長的黑磣由中間左右分開。他喜歡吃瓜子及紅椒，談話時隨吃隨講。他的大而圓的面孔，因兩目烱烱，光彩煥發。他是一大辯論家，又是一演說家。他自稱因相信中國爲中國人之中圖而避免與俄人糾　，但是他有二子正在莫斯科受教育。他在幼年時在一專制的務農的父親威權之下，做很勞苦的工作，使他起而革命，參加建立中國共產黨，很迅速的升爲農民遊擊隊隊長。因欲組織長沙人力車夫工會，自已光去當人力車夫。他進而爲紅軍委員會委員及江西蘇維埃主席，後來偕同其他人員領導十五年前之所謂「長征」。當時共黨離開了中國的中部北遷而至現在的住所，就是在俄屬西伯利亞的隔壁。毛同他的第四　美麗的電影明星籃頻住在一設備簡陋的窰洞中，那是一種宣傳，其結果成了毛氏神話，等於史太林神話，他的照片到處都可以見到。幼稚園中所敎的歌是歌頌毛同志的。今天他爲中國共產黨中最有勢力之人物，亦爲遠東有勢力者中之一員。他四周的要人都爲俄國勢力所左右，這是無可置疑的。</p>
<p>宣傳首腦　五巨頭之一員</p>
<p>周恩來爲我所遇最溫和的亞洲人，爲主持對外宣傳之首腦人物，出身宦家，貌美而時帶笑容，西裝筆挺，彬彬有禮——其出身如是，然他成爲上海南京工人之組織者，並曾計劃過兩次暴動。他在今日成爲政治局及其五豆頭中之一員，至於稱中國共產黨非共產主義者，即周氏也。</p>
<p>使周氏信仰共產主義之周夫人鄧穎超女士，曾很直爽的吿訴我：「若美國政府仍繼續支持國民黨，則共產黨將不得不求助於某國及世界各國之同志。」周氏曾謂他對於俄國並無聯絡，但周夫人無意中說起她曾與周氏於一九三九—四〇年在莫斯科住了六個月。</p>
<p>毛澤東—共黨第一個巨頭。</p>
<p>周恩來—共黨宣傳首腦。</p>
<p>朱德—共軍第一號人物。</p>
<p>被蘇軍拆毀了的遼寗兵工廠　（張文傑攝）</p>
<p>朱德部下　儘可能的豪掠</p>
<p>中國紅軍總司令朱德將軍，由於他在莫斯科受過嚴格的訓練而造成了他的地位。在一九二八年，他將兵力與毛澤東合併，而共同建立了中國第一個蘇維埃政府。</p>
<p>朱德曾招募了男女游擊隊員一二百萬名。一位高大而消瘦的農民來復槍別動隊隊長康克淸女士，一天請問他如何運用一架拿來的機關槍，結果他與她結了婚。紅軍槍械不足，所以不得不掠奪人家的。日本之投降，帶給他們一個獲得日軍貯藏的良機，朱德命令其部下儘可能地豪掠。中共在所有淪陷區中對國軍競爭，開始了迄今未止的戰事。</p>
<p>一位曾任共黨上校者吿訴我：「俄國並未公然地在滿洲支援中國共產黨，但俄國人再三將他們獲自日本的大砲的秘密位置告訴我，要我們用以攻擊國軍。」</p>
<p>一度反毛　李立三和解了</p>
<p>李立三是一個瘦長的煽動者，十五年前已是一位著省的領袖。關於他當時的逃亡，傳說他在俄國默許下，領導着一備反毛的秘密組織被發現了，所以不得不逃。</p>
<p>李立三—東北共軍政治首腦。</p>
<p>李完全是莫斯科方面的人物，他逃亡到英斯科，要了一位俄國太太，並且到遠哀大學去敎授一批回到亞洲老家來的經紀人。正像狄託帶了「新民主主義」回到南斯拉夫去作爲進入共產主義的先修課一樣，他是延安與克里寗宮的聯絡員。</p>
<p>正當蘇聯對日宣戰之前，有命令到達延安準備李的正式復職及與毛的和解。李化了姓名，搭一架美國飛機來到紅色首都—延安。一俟正式和解完成後，他就伴同馬林諾夫斯基元師統率的由蒙古人，布留特人及其他屬於蘇維埃聯邦的一百七十五個民族所組成的「俄國」軍隊，由西伯利亞進入滿洲。</p>
<p>美人為豬　東北共黨宣傳</p>
<p>中國共產黨的勢力是向西發展而到那擁有大批樸素農民區域去，他們是容易爲中共所左右的。那些農民們諦聽着共產黨所說的話—所有地主都是公衆的敵人，土地應該分給農民。共產黨常設立一個人民法庭，來處理控吿地主的案子，要求觀衆們舉手以判決之，再宣讀地主的罪狀，然後將他的土地分割之，有時用土地債劵作爲他的補償，有時簡直沒有。</p>
<p>報紙及無綫電吿訴農民—假如他續着或聽着的話—新民主的土地政策的好處。在這種宣傳的條件下，農兵只許幹着首領所吩咐的事，並已證明自己是游擊戰的熱手了。</p>
<p>國共黨方均曾互相責備對方的違背信約，但是一位美國將軍—不是馬歇爾—吿訴我：休戰條件的一切困難，百分之九十是由於共黨行動所引起的。在我和現任國務鄉的兩次談話中，他明顧地表示出希望能了解雙方。然而周恩來當放棄談判後，攻擊馬歇爾及責備杜魯門總統，說他們　動着內戰，而擬使中國轉變爲樂國的殖民地。周恩來的宣傳日益激烈，他廣播延安的結論說：「日美帝國主議的惟一區別，是美帝國主義較為强健，而其侵略方法在表而上照得文明而合法。」因此，共黨在東北敎導學童們在傳單上將美國人繪成兩頭豬，正在用脚將他們從中國踢出去。</p>
<p>亞洲的危局如何終止？動　在中國的問號是和平還是戰禍？只有時間！或者共黨領袖們—能吿訴你！</p>

<p>工程師倪桐材吿記者：南洋羣島的錫蘇因受戰爭影響，現在還未能完全復原，一旦恢復了原來的產銷情形，則僑舊錫業在現狀下是無法興之競爭的。此刻必須儘量减低成本，擴充資金，增加產量，運用機器，其實這些都是有連貫性的，歸根結蒂還在資本，因之錫貸對於箇錫的前途，實在有着極大的決定作用。</p>
<p>過去，政府對於箇舊錫的產銷訂有統制辦法，大錫出爐以後，便交給政府領取規定的價格，這對於錫商當然是一層桎梏，及至統制政策取消，却代之以黃金易錫的辦法，每噸錫換取黃金三十二兩，可是其中又須扣除保運費等開支，使廠商每噸大錫實得十八兩，經力爭後加至黃金二十三兩，可是參差太多，因此又發生了「黃金差額」問題。</p>
<p>以往所發生的糾葛一直渠在拖延，幸好自由運銷的辦法公佈了，這對於錫商們是一服强心劑，因爲廠商們的大錫可以直接運往上海香港一帶銷售，或向富滬新銀行做押匯，沒有過去那許多約束，同時錫價節節報漲，這對於錫商們更是一層新的鼓舞，飽經艱難的錫商們又在磨拳擦掌，準備大幹一番了。</p>
<p>礦區水源缺乏　需要建立電廠</p>
<p>次一問題便是水源，箇舊礦區是最缺乏水的地方，挖出來的礦砂（塃），常常要等待雨季到來，才能開始揉洗的工作，如果小龍潭的水電廠眞能成立，用電力抽吸大屯紅河的水，則簡錫的生產可以解決了一個最大的難題</p>
<p>確實，記者經過礦區時，也曾親見那份乾涸的情景，山邊殣地的一漢黃泥水，也被人珍貴地使川　，飲料取給於于此，洗臉洗脚甚至於洗衣服也仰給於此，　區的人從不曾浪費過一滴水！</p>
<p>說來，箇舊出錫業是走向復興的途中，它已經展現了一輻光明的遠景，據私營廠商的估計：今年可望產錫三千噸，再加少錫業公司的產量可以達到四千二百噸之多，每噸若以値二千五百萬元計，總値達一千餘億，大錫出口換取外匯，以現時匯率折算，四千二百噸的大錫，可以換取八百七十五萬美元，樂觀一點：若使政府能迅速而且繼續不斷地大量貸款，使礦主們能充分使用他們的資金，水炭木材等問題解決，改善開採技術，這樣下去，據證可　年產四萬噸，那麼可以換取外匯一億美元，這是一個多麼不可忽視而且可觀的數字！</p>
<p>礦商毅力堅實　前途滿可樂觀</p>
<p>勝利的火炬溫熱了每個礦商們的心重新鼓舞起希望，只是却又面臨着許多難題，不過他們的毅力是可欽佩的，要復興一個如此鉅大的事業，當然需要一股埋頭苦幹的精神，記者這次深入礦區，接觸過許多礦主他們都願意獻身於這滿有前途的事業，可是也有待於各方帮助他們解決一些難題，因爲單憑毅力，許多物質上的限制是不能迎刃而解的。</p>
<p>我看到那許多張堅實的臉子，使我對箇舊錫業前途，充滿了樂觀的信念。</p>

<h3>社會研究法</h3>
<p>— 陸固</p>
<p>著者：英韋伯夫婦　譯者：錢亦石詹哲尊　出版：商務印書館</p>
<p>韋伯是英國費邊社發起人之一，一個資格很老的社會主義者；這本書是他們夫婦倆硏究英國織工組合主義消費合作及地方自治的經騐的結晶。譯者也極推崇它是一部內容充實的著作，當我閱讀一過後，深信譯者的推薦並沒有錯。</p>
<p>社會學的發展還是近五十年的事，在中國各大學有社會學一系的，不但不多，歷史也很短暫，專門研究社會學成功的也就更少了，而且多數轉譯歡美各著作，且以社會學理論的書籍居多。社會學是一種平面的科學，主要目的在研究人與人間的關係，不論純理的或應用的社會學，必須深入社會觀察，透進各階層作種種實證，才是硏究社曾學的本義。我國社會學的幼稚，像這類有工具性的專門論著，還不多見，這並不是說人們故意忽視了它的重要，乃因爲除非社會工作較發達的國家，實不能由一二學者憑空虛構出一些硏究法出來，所以本書的價値，不言可喻，雖然本書的研究對象是英國社會的一般制度，但關於如何去着手硏究社會本身的種種技術上的或精神上的準備和修養，各國並無二致，而且更可以借鑑別國的硏究情形，而謀事半功倍之效。本書能充分提供這些例證，對於初學者固有裨益，即使專門硏究者亦有一參考的必要。</p>
<p>所谓工具性，好比昆蟲的觸　一样，有他特别的功用，这是社會工作者必備的起碼條件，本書吿訴我們如何配備及如何使甩這些工具嫻熟而有把握，並避免常識上最易犯的錯誤，如關於觀察事實的演變時的一般印象的記載，通常最易忽略，認爲無關重要，其實這是極大的錯誤，好比只看到人的骷髏而不會意想到這人的外形，這是何等荒唐而滑稽的事呢！因爲這樣，我們只能獲得一串死的概念，最後只可充爲博物館里的點綴品，完全失却社會的涵義。所以觀察社會制度的活動，猶之探悉血的化合成分，必須明瞭血在脈管里的運動情形一樣。最可貴的，他特闢兩章對於社會學的範圍及其必然的限制，加以闡釋，他首先指出社會學必需與人類爲緣，而且社會學祗涉及人們間的關係，就是觀察人間無數的結合和集團的構成及其化的種種有關係的研究，所以必强調社會學題材，只是那變些具一定的或普遍强制性的關係所以現成的一切社會制度，這是何等簡晰而有力的說明。一般人對於社會學模糊的觀念而漠視了它的價値，多由於沒有這種健全的心理基礎所致。但現代人仍不免用疑惑的心情來估低了社會學在科學界所處的特殊地位，無疑的，這是社會學進展遲滯的最大原因，要掃除一般人誤解科學的意義及其應用，我想不但是爲社會學本身應作如此辯護，即其他非物質科學亦然，韋伯知道這點，才不費辭章，反復詳述，可在他的「科學同於人生目的的關係」一章中看到。很有趣的，我國目前的社會現象，充滿着殉情主義，腐敗貪汚，監守自盜以及假公濟私的作風；在十八九世紀時，不論英國的中央政府取地方官吏也是此種狀態，然而畢竟採用了有　的審愼的有科學性質的社會發明而大大的廓淸了。這無異給我國以很好的鼓勵和模仿。就是說，社會學將有巨大的貢獻可使中國的怪現狀　轉過來，至少這決不是誕語，各先進國家已有良好成績的表現。現在的社會學的任務似應從如何深植人們對於社會學的信仰開始了。</p>
<p>本書共分十二章，章次的按排，有聯貫的階梯性，缺少了一段便會感到跨過去的困難。著者在這裏很用過一番匠心，計（一）社會學範圍的限定，（二）社會硏究者的精神準備，（三）如何硏究社會的事實，（四）筆記的技術，（五）文語，（六）口語，（七）英國皇家委員會及分科委員會，（八）觀察社會制度的活動，（九）統計的應用，（十）證實，（十一）發表，（十二）科學對於人生目的的關係。綜觀全篇重心所繫，係在第（二）（八）（十）（十一）四章。</p>
<p>關於社會硏究者的精神準備，所謂精神準備是社會硏究者在開始探討社會組織時的理想的精神狀態，大凡一種可稱科學的皆有其部分的特殊的精神準備，社會學無例外，且格外重要，韋白說的好：「觀察事物是通過我們的視覺，而不是使用我們的視覺」這與物質科學的研究態度就有些不同，固然，物質科學的硏究是頂客觀的了，而非物質科學底偏見的無可避免，又是千眞萬確的事，一般以爲某些人們是「無私的人物」時，不過是雙方偏見的一致的意思，所以爲求社會硏究的準確，對於事實的客觀研究及其他附帶必需的條件如同情理解的必要，普通技術能方的培養，一般知識的廣博，有了這些確切的認識，才談得上如何硏究社會事實％硏究社會事實，著者也透露了很寳貴的一個秘訣是「研究的題材應爲某種特殊社會制度的整體或部分，不應是一種自以爲必須尋求解決的問題」。這一章中描述通常所用的紙上答問法，章伯曾因此而失敗過，這便是很有價値的一參考資料。</p>
<p>關於觀察社會制度的活動，他舉了極多的例子，這裏應包括各種技術的應用筆記，口語，文語，統計術等；文語中又分文件與文學。他對於文學下了個頗廣泛的定義，即除了政府或地方各機關有時間性的文件外其他一切著作都是文學，這在社會學上是很適宜的，而且他屢屢提到文件和統計必須倚賴口語和當代文學的佐證。</p>
<p>關於證實和發表，這是一切科學的最後兩個步驟，但以發表爲論題列入科學方法著作中，是很少見的。社會學正和他種科學一樣，尤其因爲他們獲得的社會制度的事實，無論由於單純的或複雜的觀察都不十分可靠，所以必須用兩種質的比較戰各別的詳盡的試騐而所能發現的亦不過是事實的或然性，換言之，社會學家利用現階段的各種獨立和有系統的設據，得到的只有限於傾向的意議的結果，旣然社會學在今日所處的知識領域內，當每一假定的確定需要如此困難和繁複的無偏見的及有系統的證實，又因所處理的題材不易使他人肯定的接受自己的結論，所以一有進步的發現，就得馬上發表出來，韋伯說這是「社會硏究者的特殊任務，也只有這種方法，社會學才能獲得關於先輩科學上所享受的那種確切的地位」。韋伯在「證實」章中，還附帶提及資本主義下的證實工作是浪費而被獨占的，可說是給人以很好的一個警覺</p>
<p>本書完全是一種工作經騐上所得成果的得失，我想它的價値就在此；至於本書譯文的流暢，，我相信呌人「反復推敲」的苦處是沒有的，所以我相信介紹這本著作也不是徒費的吧。</p>
<h3>介紹「中學生」　（月刋開明書店印行）</h3>
<p>— 高寗</p>
<p>廣大的中學生們，往往苦於找不到課外進修讀物，而感到煩惱，這現乘是活生生地存在着的</p>
<p>我讓了好久期的「中學生」雜誌之後，深深地感到：解救中學生靑年們上述煩惱的，在出版界裏不是沒有的，而是他們沒有去尋找，這本「中學生」就是大可一讀的刋物。</p>
<p>這本「中學生」是綜合性的刋物，它裏面包括敎育時事，社會科學，作文指導，自然科學，文藝，讀者園地，新聞輯要各方面。</p>
<p>以量近出的第一八七期（五月號）為例，它是有這樣優良的內容；</p>
<p>時事方面，它有一篇「一個多月來的莫斯科會議」，詳述了這一會議的意義，及它的性質，一靑年學生讀了，可以瞭然。</p>
<p>自然料學方面有「太陽黑子的變選」，科學方面的「電子的無熱發射」，兩文都是充實靑年學生的科學知識之作。</p>
<p>每一期中，更有陳原先生介紹一個國家，這期是變革中的束方——越南。了這些文章後，對於小國家的情形，可以予以很明確的認識。</p>
<p>關於世界上時代人物的介紹，它也每期都有，本期中是介紹了：汽車大王福特，越南共和國總統胡志明二人。假使不知道這些人物的身世的，讀了之後，可使你知道，這是很重要的。</p>
<p>文藝方面，它有「愛國者」劇本迎載，以及中學生的徼文。</p>
<p>一月新聞輯要，對於中學生們的讀報，是很有帮助的，例如在本期中，它是這樣地輯要吿訴讀者：</p>
<p>中國國民黨的三中全會——國軍進駐延安——關於人權保障——莫斯科會議在交換分歧意見中——關於中國的兩個文件——汎亞會議在新德里。</p>
<p>這些，都是一個月內的重要新聞，中學生們證了它以後，可知上一個月內的重要新聞，從而，對於讀本月份內的新聞時，可得不少的帮助。</p>
<p>個人以爲，這確是一本合理想的靑年中學生課外進修續物。</p>
<p>在過去幾期中，可以特別推薦的還有特輯一類的作品，如「中學生與政治」，（有曹孚，孫起孟，周予同，張志讓，吳耀宗，沈亦珍，陳靑士等人的意見。）如「中學生與文藝」（有蕭乾，呂叔湘，减克家，菳麟，李廣田，平伯，適夷，柯靈，曹伯韓，了易，朱自淸諸人的意見）。這些重大間題，正是對每一個中學生有興趣的。</p>
<h3>中國人事問題新論</h3>
<p>— 黃維廉</p>
<p>吾國自抗戰勝利以來，百廣待舉，國事千頭萬緒，亟待整理，祇須有適當的人，出而肩負重任，計劃一切，則建設事業可逐漸復興，國家大事可上軌道。關於吾國用人行政，向分人治與法治兩派；人治派主張人治，以人爲行政的中心；法治派主張法洽，以行政應注意制度法律；但無論如何，脫不了「人」；假使良法之外，更輔以適當的人，則良法可以推行，如能使人人各當其才，各盡其職，更爲重要的事。</p>
<p>近年來國內出版界，對於人事行政，頗多關心，已出版的人事行政書籍，爲數不少，如何淸儒人事管理（商務民二十二年版），薛伯康人事行政大鋼（正中民三十六年滬版），張金鑑人事行政學（商務版），及各國人事行政制度概要（正中民三十五年滬版），屠哲隱人事管理的實施（世界民三十五年版），趙宗預人的管理（世界民三十五年版），此外尙有何魯成人事考核（商務民三十五年上海版），張振鐸人事工程學（商務民三十五年上海版），黃炎培機關管理一得（商務民三十五年再版），蕭孝蠑人事心理問題，（商務民三十四年上海版）等等，但多數是介紹英美的文官制度，或工商管理制度，很少就本國的實際問題，發揮具體意見。</p>
<p>黃景柏氏所著的「中國人問題新論」一書，可謂研究人事　行政學的實際問題的書，蓋除了經濟問題之外，中國當今莫大的急務確為人事問題。外次甘乃光先生在本書的序內說：「在此急轉直下的趨勢中，我國的人事行政將引起一些什麽變化，牽涉到若干其他的問題，這也是研究人事行政的人應加注意的。當此民主集權，國防第一的時代，國際間國力的對比，原包括人力的對此，以政府的立場言，人事行政的範疇，當不僅限於政府的官吏，或工商的員工，國國營公營事業的人員，其範圍是廣義的，概括的，是為謀全國人力動員的整個計劃，對全民都要有一合理的支配與運用。</p>
<p>本書所論的中國人事問題，包括中國人事問題的特質，建國的人才問題，現階段的考試問題，非常時期的考績問題，公務永業化的實施問題，職位文類的舉辦問題，人事行政制度的建立間題，人事機構的改進問題等等，這一切辦法，將如何實施，如何開始，吏是研究人事行政的人應加注意的。全書分析事理，題供辦法，研究湛深，且立論精審，洵為從事研究中國目前人事行政問題的重要書籍。</p>
<p>輓近吾國行政當局，對於改善組織，統制財政，改良辦事方法等等，極為重視，而於用人行政，每多忽視，其實用人行政，較其他一切問題，更為重要，蓋行政之推動，端賴乎人，若徒謀改良辦事方法，而忽略用人問題則舍本務末，礙難收效。　昔科舉時代，學優則仕，今者人事考核，漸被重視，且各處已在試行，而對於選拔賢能，人盡其才的種種問題，反不講求，似屬矛盾</p>
<p>的確，中國目前的最大問題，仍是用人的問題，經濟問題還是第二。有了適當的人才。會運用經濟的設施，換言之，即經濟問題終是被動的，主動的機構終是人。關於人的間題是很大，上有上的人，下有下的人，如欲便全部機構上下合作，在上而為領袖者，除足以通盤籌劃，領導羣眾外，須有感人以德之能力，待人寬恕之心；在下而為人服務者，須有眞正服務之精神，適合環境，忠賞合作之顯。所謂人事制度之主要精神，還是為事擇人，辨別能否，使賢能者各盡其長，各稱其職，則不致敷衍了事，濫竽充數。</p>
<p>最可惜者，今有人也，於職務方面，既不能嚴守本分，亦不能與人合作，而於權利方面，則斤斤較量，不能絲毫參差，軋與在上者為難。不知權利義務，兩者相輔而行，既曰權利，必有主務，先有義務，而後有權利；且為人服務，先有人而後有己，則為人謀而不忠乎，未之聞焉。</p>
<p>因此，今後的人事制度，第一應以求才為主要任務，除用考試方法而外，各種人才應有板精密的調查，務使銓叙機關為登進人才之總匯，而得發揮為事擇人的作用。此外上下的人，各盡各的本領，各盡各的職務，處處能彼此諒解，絕對不存自私自利的心，則中國的人事問題，可迎刃而解。</p>
<h3>外國語文　學習指南</h3>
<p>— 雋之</p>
<p>陳原著　實學書局出版</p>
<p>外國語文是我們生活鬥爭中的武器，作為新時代的每一個人民，對這武器的把握是必須的。</p>
<p>毫無猶豫地，現在的每一個青年，都必須要學習一種或數種外國語文，在學校教育裏，也昔通至少有一種外國語文的必修課，至於學得了外國文的好處，那是誰都知道的，它無論在學術上，文藝上，都會給你很多的帮助——例如研究哲學者，可讀懂很多原本，愛好文藝者，又可以去讀原著的文，那眞是既有進步而又是窮的。</p>
<p>但是，我們所見到的一殺學生，青年們，他們對外國語文的學習，往往有的不十分看重，有的祗是在學校裏的教本讀幾遍，敷衍了事，更有的對學習外國語文有了曲解，他們以為學習外國語文是當作「做生意」的另一手段，如學英文爲了想做買辦之類，這一類的現象，我們是見得很多的，正因為如此，我們必需提出來，糾正這些五色繽紛的鐘誤現象，而踏上眞正地為了研究性，鬥爭性的學習道絡！</p>
<p>陳原的這本者作，是指示給學習外國語文年的一些學習方法的書。</p>
<p>這本書的內容，大體上是值為一讀的，除很少的小節而外。內容的依據，都是作者的一些自己底經騐，所以也可以說是學習的經騐談。本書的內容：</p>
<p>第一，作者是寫「學呢還是不學呢」？的問題，這結論很簡單，就是「外國語是應該學習的」，但還應該「可以酌量變通」，作者的理由是這樣的：要學的話，是：「要是你有興緻，有工具，並且有時間，或者總可以擠出一點時間來，那即使是在流動的生活中，也無妨開始你的學習」。</p>
<p>第二，是學習的原則方面，「五到主義「——「眼到，耳到，口到，心到，手到」，誠然是學習中的最主要的，作者也強調要這五到主義。這是必須的。</p>
<p>此外的「唸字典」——作者指出這是不妥當的，多用，用基礎，攻堅，讀雜誌，精讀，翻譯諸方面，可以說對學習者是很有神益的指示。</p>
<p>第三，是談了各種語文——現代方面的：世界語，法語，英語，德語，俄語，日語；古代語方面也簡略提到，拉丁文與希伯來交。</p>
<p>這方面，作者指出現代語方面，幾乎每一種都不容易的，這當然有理由的。古代語方面，作者勸學習外國語者最好要懂古代語，因為歐洲的語言多半源出於此，因此懂得了古代語，對於學習現代語時，無不感到容易。這話，我深具同感，並且希望學習外國語愛好者，都能這樣去做。</p>
<p>據我知道，學習外國語的步驟，必需要知道它底：——本質——起源——發展——構造，明乎此，學習上是十分容易的，所以古代文是很有理由去學習它的</p>
<p>第四，作者提出學習方法篇，它指出：一，讀音，二·字彙，三·文法，四·熟語，五·會話，六·翻譯，七·寫作，八·應用，九·韻文，十·結尾。</p>
<p>這裏面所告訴學者的方法，的確可為學習者的良好參考。</p>
<p>最後，是開了一批學習的書目，這些書目有些書是很可參考，而又有些書是不正確的，這一點，也希望作者於再版時好好修正。</p>
<p>我們知道，在學習上，「是沒有平坦的大路可走的，只是那在攀登上不畏險阻的人，方有希望到光輝的頂點」。這是名言，是不錯的。</p>
<p>這本書也並不是什麽　習捷徑，而是學習上的良好指示。我們要記住上面這句名言，然後讀這本書，是深有益處的。</p>

<h3>「兩代圖」</h3>
<p>— 鑯慈</p>
<p>沈寂著　日新文藝義書</p>
<p>在沒有談到這本輝煌的短篇小說集「兩代圖」之前，讓我們先來回憶一下在淪陷時上海的文藝情况吧。因為這是完全必要的，並且也不是全無意義的事。</p>
<p>如果要在淪陷區談言“論自由，出版自由，自然是不可想像的事，如果要寫一篇激發關於抗日或反納粹思想的文藝作品，所遭遇到的也必然是逮捕，酷刑或者段戰。因此，在這時期，文藝所走的道路是異乎尋常的艱難和曲折，有的是純粹以智識青年的男女戀愛問題作主題，以技巧的究美和故事的結構成為傳誦一時的鴛鴦蝴蝶派，有的是着重於人情味的流露，對於小情小節的細緻的描劃，有的則是大胆地以人類性慾的染為號泣召，還有風行的是偵探，俠盜，香艷，猥褻……總之，一切無聊的以消遣，麻醉為目的的文藝的渣滓，都隨着這政治上的逆流而昇了起來，填滿者淪陷區的，已被麻醉了理智和情感的人民的都市面前。</p>
<p>但是，同時，也是不容抹煞的，充滿着朝氣的，鬥爭氣息的文藝也在這不可忍耐的氣候中萌芽出來，担負起了這苦悶時代給每個有良心的文藝工作者所應盡的責任。像一顆巨大的火把，發揮着火和熱，在這昏無天日的時代中，從「盜馬賊」，「鬼」，「大草澤的獷悍」……這樣一聯串的短篇小說中，這位豪放的作者，以最大的爆發的情感的火光，遠射入涡求着解放，光明的陰贈的人民的心坎裏，促成燃燒的近乎瘋狂的情感，使已經麻木了的軟弱的人民的感情「爆發」，而完成了最理智的，反抗心理的愛與憎。</p>
<p>「兩代圖」的作者有着一個陰森的名字，沈寂這本書，是在陰暗晦澤的候中所完成的，裏面包含了十篇短小精悍的小說，在寫作方法上，仍舊是用着他極度張烈的情感放置在絕對獷悍·荒凉·恐怖·憂鬱……的情緒中，在激動中，完成了他情感和理智的形象化——對於故事的叙述，而把它們提升，燃燒到最高的飽和點，在故事結束時，作者照例地教喜突破這飽和點，使讀者的感情也同時突破，同時爆發，但是却完成了作者的目的，開闊了感受者的情感，結果同樣發野獚悍地正對着愛情和憎恨。而在技巧上，淸楚地可以看郵作者有着更完美的進展，不論在對於字句的鍛鍊，人物的探求，和情緒環境的描畫中。</p>
<p>對着這樣完整的藝術品，我們是應該為作者的前途樂觀的。</p>
<p>並且在這本書的最前一頁，作者是寫下了這壹句名言：「你有沒有見過蝎織？她們為了渡過一道水，先頭的自己溺斃在水裏，讓後來的在牠們屍身上爬過去。」</p>
<p>文配合着作者道樣偉大的精神，我想：隧史會得證明，「兩代團」是新文藝上燦爛光鋩的收艧。</p>

<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>和禹治水乏所以一失一得。理由似乎太簡單，中學的孩子們也能在他們的試卷上寫得淸淸楚楚。　的失敗，未始沒有功勞，因為他以事實告訴了後人，築堤防水並不是好辦法。</p>
<p>別看不起水，牠是一切生物的命運之所　。牠被放在茶盃裏似乎很平靜，然後涓滴入海，便會形成不可思議的巨大的力量。而所謂洶湧的汪洋，也正是消滴所彙集而成。</p>
<p>至於想在大海中，築起防水之堤，以建造夢幻的王國，是既不可能，亦不必妄動此念的。</p>
<p>無論是多末可口的食品，第一要有胃口，第二要能下咽。</p>
<p>友邦送來了許多罐頭給我們，盛意自然可感，街頭常常可以看到堆積如山的罐頭食品，售價也相當低廉，可是銷路不好，其原因是頗可使關心民生社會的人們思索一番的。</p>
<p>徐蔚南先生說：「遠不如送些臭腐乳來。」進並不是一句遠人發笑的話。</p>
<p>因為我們廣大人民的胃口不在吃餅乾，亦不在白脫油。</p>
<p>太抬舉了我們，是會令我們由受寵而至於　癇的。</p>
<p>所以一切善意的賜予，務請乘念我們一般人的胃口；然後，我們才能下咽。</p>
<p>祖國四萬萬同胞大都是貧苦的，出洋和住洋房的幸運究竟是屬於極少數的人們的。</p>
<p>我希望別人的慈悲不會引起　　的惡果。</p>
<h3>漫談翻譯新聞</h3>
<p>— 嚴安孚</p>
<p>翻譯委實不是一件容易的事情，翻譯新聞，尤其關於國際政治·軍事·經濟·文化·教育等消息，更加困難。第一，從事翻譯工作的人，對於外國文字，須有充分的瞭解力，然後把它譯成流利通順的本國文字。這是最基本的條件。除了這個文字方面的技巧之外，還要對於國際時事，有相當的認識。同時，譯成了本國文字之後，須使本國人看了能夠明白，這樣才可算為盡了翻譯的責任。現在這裏所談的，是關於新聞的翻譯，尤其是由英文譯成中文。</p>
<p>照着英文原文的字面而譯成死板板的中文，令人讀了莫名其妙，或容易引起誤解，這是要不得的。記得在一個多月以前，在本埠某通訊社所發的中文電訊稿裏面，有所謂「蘇聯武力部長」的一段譯稿。這「武力部長」一個名辭實在欠妥當。想來這個名辭的英文原文或許是Minister　of　Armed　Forced。「武力部長」這個名辭，不但令人見了感覺陌生，而且容易招人誤會，因為「武力」二字，往往使人聯想郵「戰爭」，「侵略」，「擴張」等一類的字眼。一個好好的軍政部長，給他這樣一譯，豈非變成了「希特勒第二」了嗎？</p>
<p>把外國的政府部會或機構名稱譯成中文，首先應該明白這個國家的政體。在英文裏面，首相稱為Premier，國務總理也稱Premier，甚至我國政府的行政院長也稱Premier。但是譯成中文的時候，就要十分注意，把它分淸楚。如果把「首相」二字，指一個共和政體國家裏面的國務總理，那就無異對總統稱皇帝一樣的笑話了。美國的國務院（State　Department，其實約等於其他各國的外交部，不過範圍較大，把它譯成國務院這名辭，也可以說是無傷大雅。但是既譯作國務院，何不就把Secretary　ofState譯為國務院長，為什麽却又弄出一個「國務卿」來。這不知又是那一位翻譯先生「首創其義」。試想像美國這樣一個民主主義的共和國家，怎麼還會有「卿」的存在。可是後來大家將錯就錯，全體「跟進」，於是國務院長就一直被稱為國務卿了。</p>
<p>說到這裏，又想起了關於前任國務卿（恕我也跟進）的譯名。美國的前任國務卿是Byrmes這個姓氏的　韶該是培恩斯）重音在「培」字上面）。不知那一位把　姓氏譯作貝爾納斯·後來大家又是將錯就錯，照例「跟進」。有一次我在屯溪聽得一個中國記者和一個美國軍官大談時事。那位記者英語講得還不差，可是他說到關於「貝爾納斯」的話的時候，那個美國軍官不懂他在講什麽人。後來那位記者用鉛筆在白紙上寫了Byrnes一字後，才明白他所說的是培恩斯。</p>
<p>最近本市各中文報紙刋載關於毆斃臧大二子案的新聞，內有「外交部旋接美領事館轉據美軍法庭之出函稱：「中國法院之請求，本軍法庭極感興趣…」」一節。這裏「極感興趣」幾個字，似乎很值得斟酌。這幾個字的英文原文，想來一定是Interested一字。鄙意在這裏應該譯作「注意」或「關心」而不該譯作「興趣」。像這種人命關天的案子，用「感覺興趣」一類的字句，似乎不大順眼，而且意義完全不同；譬如你對一個朋友說：「近來聽到令尊大人歸天的消息，我很關心（或很注意）」如果改說：」近來聽到令尊大人歸天的消息，我很感興趣」。那不是笑話嗎？</p>
<p>以上所談的拉雜漫散，毫無系統，無非吹毛求疵，說說笑笑而已。</p>

<h3>林森中路散步</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>十四年前，我住上海薛華立路時，每天下午，我常在霞飛路一帶散步，從法國公園華籠路起，一直走到回力球場亞爾培路口為止，這一段街道，非常淸潔，且常常遇見朋友，那時孫福熙住在環龍路花園別墅，他家裏好像是大本營。</p>
<p>這次抗戰勝利後，朋友多半星散，我返滬一年多，各處回來的人、又重新聚在上海林森中路一帶，我依然常常在這一段路散步，不過比昔日兩頭放長點，東苜要到馬當路口，因為我常到上海市教育局，西頭延至襄陽北路，甚至延至福開森路口，世界文化合作中國協會在那裏，呂班路有雲林書畫社與黃山藝苑，林森公園附近，有香靈國與文藝咖啡館，李石曾住浦石路，孫福熙現住環龍路近陝西南路，巴金住靈飛坊，歐陽予俏住林森中路，陝西南路口，畢修勺住長樂路，汪亞應仍舊住原原地薛華坊，所以進殺絡，不但不寂寞，而且感到比十多年前，格外繁榮！</p>
<p>上海市體育館，分一部分房間，做了上海文藝作家協會與上海市美術館籌備處；由重慶遷移來滬之文協總會，會址在康悌路，比較路程遠得多；但作家書屋則在折鄰，王進珊與劉瓶栗，劉獅都近復興公園左右，魯莽常常到新聞專科學校，以上的朋友，每逢星期大下午，大都到香　國茶座聚談，徐仲年雖住海防絡，但是他回上海，必在這一段路上奔走。</p>
<p>四川北路朋友甚多，但絡程太遠，很少跑到那裏去，就是關於文化活動的事，也多半集中在林森中路一帶。昔日散步，以法國公園為中心，現在以林森公園做中心了。可惜陸不如的黎明學園已停辦，否則必園內又多一番熱閙。</p>
<h3>東久邇開飯店</h3>
<p>— 葉林</p>
<p>合眾社的消息，說是東久邇這屈降後的日本第一任首相要在東京車站附近黑市區開小飯店了，聞附設茶座，供應淸茶，咖啡。如果一旦新張，廣田，須磨，永野之流與頭山滿高徒們必將成為座上乏賓。而使茶座成為「整肅同志」之Cjub吧。</p>
<p>東久邇宮的「宮」字是隨皇族封爵之褫奪而取消了，記者的筆觸勾繪他已不再是高不可攀的人物，因為現在無論誰去看他，再不需要穿上晨禮服，戴起大禮帽和白手套，他已是一個平民的身份。唯其平民，所以東久邇要開個飯館，由於已失去他的「采邑」。如果開設飯店不祗是一種虛偽的裝點，而是一種營生之計，那自然是日本人民乏幸。由此可知，他們的公民權外再沒有貴族特權的存在，不會使他們再受一次壓迫與剝削。</p>
<p>在日本，一九四五年是一個歷史的重要分野時代，這個分野的主要關鍵是在天皇與皇族必然回復了人的身份。東久邇正是由貴族而為平民的，祗是到今天。仙與他一流的人物都僅是整肅，未被算淸，在他們個人言，這是一種幸遝，在歷史言，我們遠難知其後果。聽說東久邇有言：「我將注視日本的重建工作。艱苦與歡樂，都想分嘗一攀」。並為取得平民的身份而高興。若果此非解嘲，我們願意告訴東久邇「宮」，他所得的必是艱苦，我們也願意告訴東久邇，他所得的必是歡樂，即使不願分嘗一蠻，歷史也不容他逃避。</p>
<p>故在此時如昔之東久邇宮今之東久邇等開設飯店，固所願聞，亦願為之賀。</p>
<h3>孩子的憂傷</h3>
<p>— 施星火</p>
<p>今天，在一位小學三年級的小朋友的週記簿上，讀郵這樣一段文字，</p>
<p>『我昨天放學回家，看見天空中有一架飛機，在那裏打　子，我想：「假使第三次世界大戰開始，我們的性命一定保不牢」！」</p>
<p>這一段文字多麽簡單，又多麽深刻！</p>
<p>寫這篇週記的是一位十二三歲非常頑皮的小朋友，在一班當中可算是出各的「吵客」，誰知在他的胸腑中閒，竟也深深地鏤刻着陰影，——多麼可怕的陰影呵！</p>
<p>細味那一段短短的話，似乎不像孩子的口吻，簡直充滿了成人的憂傷，而且那憂傷又是這樣滯重，使人讀了立刻感染郵一種難於言說的惆悵。</p>
<p>也許是從長輩們的口中，聽到的次數太多了的緣故吧；在老師要他做週記的當兒，才會不由自主地寫下了那一段話，可見這些一話至少是已經從孩子的腦中濾過了的、竟找不出絲毫天眞和樂觀的影子，這是多麼可怕的事！</p>
<p>事實上，像這樣十二三歲的孩子，完全是從烽火中長成起來，他們對於災禍，對於飢饉，都有着無可磨滅的印象，尤其是物價的賸貴，使他們無從得到應該有的最低限度的營養和保育。生活的黑手扼住了幼小者們的咽喉，使他們不能不想到：「假使第三次世界大戰開始，我們的性命一定保不牢。」</p>
<p>這種早熟的不建康的思懇，正反映着當前兒童們的悲哀時才能使我們下一代從這陰影下面解放出來？</p>
<p>這裏我們不能不疾呼：「救救我們的幼小者」！</p>

<p>「緋緋，是不是朦酸」？</p>
<p>她點點頭，又閉上了眼睛，雙手却始終捧着那頭條了玩的銅製的兔子。</p>
<p>「好，那就不要吃了」！老祝勉强用董女性般的溫婉的口吻說：「回頭火車一停，祝伯伯就去質水來給緋緋喝」。</p>
<p>緋緋不再說什麽，好像也想竭力使自已安睡。</p>
<p>那　餘的四分之一和梨兒他可不改扣掉，依然很小心地用兩個手指夾着，讓它虛懸在自己的手掌下面，他怕過一會緋緋又想吃。</p>
<p>三十多分鐘過去了，緋緋似乎已熟　了一會，突然，她從老祝懷裏直迸了起來，睜大兩眼，一面哭，一面高喊：「媽媽，緋緋要你！緋緋要你」！慌得祝兆年來不及的用手摟住她，同時把她輕輕地搖撼着。</p>
<p>「緋緋，聽」　！別怕！伯伯在這裏」！他接連說了好風過，夢中驚醒的緋緋才漸漸安靜了下來，可是老祝一試她的熱度，竟又比方才高了許多。</p>
<p>「緋緋，頭痛不痛」？他輕輕地問。</p>
<p>「痛！痛！痛」！緋緋把右手指了指自己的頭，爽快哭起來了。</p>
<p>祝兆年立刻覺得車廂裏的溫度彷　　然增加了十度，他的前額上和身上都　出了一陣陣的汗珠來。</p>
<p>「不妨事的，緋緋，你靜一靜，過一會就好了」！仙祗能姑且用言語安慰她。「待火車到了下一站，祝伯伯馬上給你評水喝，再給你買兩個又黃又圓的小麪包。緋緋，你說，是不是飲愛吃小麪包」。</p>
<p>緋緋那一張幾天來突然瘦削了一半的小臉上，這才透認了淡淡的一絲笑意。</p>

<h3>Mongol Troops Invade Xinjiang Incident: I Lodge a Serious Protest with the Soviets and Mongols, and Plan to Immediately Send Senior Officials to Xinjiang to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the incident of Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang, our government has lodged a serious protest with both Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union. Zhang Yuan-chang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced the following when answering reporters' questions at a press conference held by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan on the 11th: "Regarding the Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang and attacking our defense forces stationed at Beitashan, our government has naturally received reports. This matter is not an ordinary border conflict, and our government attaches great importance to it. The local military authorities have been ordered to firmly defend our territory and handle the matter cautiously. Our ambassador stationed in Moscow has also been ordered to lodge a serious protest with the Soviet government, and through the Outer Mongolian envoy stationed in Moscow, to the Outer Mongolian government." According to the inquiries made by reporters today regarding the aforementioned incident, there were as many as nine questions, the contents of which are as follows: (1) Outer Mongolian troops have invaded six hundred li into Xinjiang, and four aircraft with Soviet markings participated. Does this contradict the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and what explanation does the government spokesperson have for this? (2) In terms of diplomacy, what measures does the government intend to take regarding this matter, and will a protest be lodged today? (3) If the government lodges a protest, is the target the Soviet Union or Outer Mongolia? Since our country and Outer Mongolia have not yet exchanged diplomatic envoys, what method will be used to protest to Outer Mongolia? (4) According to a dispatch from Dihua (Ürümqi) by the Central News Agency, Asman, the commissioner of the Altai district, has been under pressure from a certain party since February of this year, retreating step by step. From February to the present, four months have passed. During this period, has the government received reports regarding this border incident? Will attention be paid to it? Also, during this period, will diplomatic negotiations be conducted on this matter, and what are the details? (5) Before the Outer Mongolian troops invaded Xinjiang, did any incidents occur on the border that Outer Mongolia could use as an excuse, or does the Outer Mongolian side have other excuses, and what are they? (6) Is there collusion between the Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang and local ethnic minorities? What is the attitude of the people towards the Outer Mongolian troops in the areas occupied by the Outer Mongolian troops? (7) Is our garrison in the Altai district only resisting? Is it also preparing to recover lost territory? If the Outer Mongolian troops continue to invade, what measures will the government take to stop them? (8) What is the strength of the garrison in Xinjiang, especially in the Altai district, and does it have sufficient strength to stop the Outer Mongolian troops from continuing to invade? Is the government preparing to send reinforcements? (9) If the Outer Mongolian troops continue to invade, will this lead to the consideration of our government declaring war on Outer Mongolia?</p>
<p>The Chairman Summons Zhang Qun and Liu Fei, Asking About the Mongol Troops' Invasion of Xinjiang</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Chairman Chiang invited Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun for dinner at 8 p.m. on the 11th, and summoned Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Fei at 10 p.m., asking about the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] We will send senior officials to Xinjiang to investigate and handle the matter successively. However, the candidates have not yet been determined. They may be senior responsible personnel from the diplomatic or national defense fields. The candidates will be decided in one or two days. It is reported that Chairman Chiang is scheduled to summon Bai Chongxi on the 12th to inquire about the matter. When the Kuomintang held a Central Standing Committee meeting on the morning of the 11th, it was decided on the spur of the moment to invite Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to attend and report. Wang said after briefly recounting the incident that the report on this matter was obtained from the Ministry of National Defense, and the handling of this matter should be resolved through diplomatic means, with the government lodging a protest and sending personnel to conduct an actual investigation. However, the external spokesperson maintained an extremely cautious attitude when answering reporters' questions about this matter. Zhang Yuan-chang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, attended the Information Bureau's press conference on the afternoon of the 11th. It is said that Vice Minister Ye was unable to attend due to official business, so he represented him. Reporters had previously raised nine questions concerning national defense and diplomacy regarding the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion, and Zhang avoided answering them directly. According to reporters' inquiries, our protests to the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia have been lodged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The protest to the Soviet Union is about the Soviet aircraft bombing. Diplomatic authorities have also been in contact with the Soviet Embassy. Fedlin Ko, the counselor of the Soviet Embassy, visited Vice Minister Ye of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 11th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Government officials announced today that the Outer Mongolian troops' attack on Beita town in Xinjiang was caused by the issue of the release of eight Mongolian soldiers captured by Chinese troops in the last border dispute. Outer Mongolian troops, supported by the air force, attacked Beita after the expiration of a 48-hour ultimatum. The commander of the Mongolian army stated that unless the eight captured Mongolian soldiers were released immediately, he would resort to force, and then launched an attack from both land and air. It is reported that the commander of the Beita garrison proposed negotiations with the Outer Mongolian side, but a peaceful solution was not reached.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan to Hold Regular Meeting Today: Xinjiang Deputies to Propose a Provisional Motion, Suggesting that the Government Adopt a Tough Diplomatic Stance</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] When the Legislative Yuan holds its 327th meeting on the 12th, Xinjiang deputies Guang Lu, Hua Shengmu, etc., will propose a provisional motion regarding the Soviet aircraft covering the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang, suggesting that the authorities adopt a tough stance on this matter. Guang Lu and others met with reporters on the morning of the 11th and expressed their feelings about this matter, believing that the occurrence of this incident was within expectations. At the same time, they pointed out that the ethnic issue is not serious in Xinjiang today, and what is worth noting is the international relationship. At the same time, the Xinjiang incident can be viewed in the same light as the current Inner and Outer Mongolia, Northeast China and other issues, because the problems that have occurred in the above-mentioned areas have commonalities. After the Yining Incident, Xinjiang people advocated that the government should take a tough stance towards the Soviet Union and appeal to the United Nations Security Council to attract international attention. Today, they still advocate adopting a tough diplomatic approach.</p>
<h3>People in the Capital are Shocked</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] After the news of Soviet aircraft covering the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang was released, people in the capital expressed extreme shock. All newspapers published it in the most prominent position, and some even accompanied it with maps to draw the attention of the people of the country. The Soviet Embassy, which was usually very deserted, has now become a target for reporters to interview. On the 11th, reporters interviewed people familiar with border affairs to inquire about their views on this matter. They all believed that the Outer Mongolian troops invaded our country's territory by 600 li under the cover of Soviet aircraft, and are now only more than 300 li away from Qitai. If they invade further and advance to Qijiaojing and other places, the northern route of Tianshan will be cut off, and there will be no way to contact Dihua and Hami (that is, Xinjiang and the interior). Therefore, the development of the situation cannot be ignored. As for the cause of this incident, they all believed that this matter had international factors in it, so they all believed that following diplomatic channels to resolve it may also be an effective method. Speaking of the immediate cause of this matter, a Xinjiang person who had just come to Nanjing from Dihua a week ago told reporters that this incident was caused by the conspiracy of Dalilehan, who was supported by external forces. Dalilehan is a Kazakh, who was active in the area bordering Outer Mongolia and the Altai district before the signing of the peace treaty. After the peaceful settlement of the new situation and the withdrawal of the Outer Mongolian troops, the government announced that Asman would be the commissioner of the Altai district, and Dalilehan, under the instigation of a certain party, did everything possible to obstruct Asman, making it almost impossible for him to take over. Last winter, 3,000 cavalry disguised as "Yining" troops suddenly came to the Altai district to help Dalilehan attack Asman, and the war continued intermittently. Recently, the Outer Mongolian troops launched a fierce attack under the cover of Soviet aircraft, and the situation has expanded. These Mongolian troops once occupied the Altai district before the signing of the peace treaty, so they are very familiar with the terrain of the area.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Embassy Makes No Comment</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Soviet Embassy refused to comment on the Xinjiang matter on the 11th. It is said that this matter was only learned from the newspapers, and no comment will be made before knowing the details. The embassy also made no comment on our protest.</p>
<h3>No Official Report Received: US Officials Remain Silent</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 10th] Regarding the Nanjing news that Outer Mongolian troops invaded Chinese territory under the cover of Soviet aircraft, responsible officials here stated that the US State Department does not attach much importance to this. Up to now, the US State Department has not received an official report. The US government has repeatedly received similar news of this kind within the past month, some of which came from the Chinese government, but none of them have been confirmed.</p>
<h3>News of the Mongol Troops' Attack on Xinjiang: Prominently Published in American Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Evening newspapers here published the report from Nanjing about the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang on the front page. The headline of the New York Sun was "Outer Mongolian Troops Invade China, Troops of the Outer Mongolian Republic Break into Xinjiang Under the Cover of Soviet Aircraft." The newspaper used a report from the Associated Press based on news from the Central News Agency, which stated: "It is confirmed that Outer Mongolian troops invaded Xinjiang on the afternoon of the 5th of this month under the cover of four aircraft with Soviet markings." The Associated Press said that according to a certain military observer, due to the remote distance and the lack of readily available troops, the central government does not seem likely to send sufficient defense forces to Xinjiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai branch of the National Diplomacy Association is scheduled to invite leaders from all walks of life today to exchange views on the countermeasures our country should take after the Xinjiang incident. The association will make an important statement on this matter.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Returns to Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 11th] Zhang Boling flew from Shanghai to Peiping on the 11th and returned to Tianjin in the afternoon. Regarding the Outer Mongolian invasion, Zhang expressed his emotion, saying that if the Chinese people all had patriotism, China would be the strongest country in the world. Now everything is due to everyone's lack of patriotism, but I am not pessimistic, and I will still do my best to devote myself to education.</p>
<h3>Qitai District, Xinjiang Province: Produces Raw Materials for Atomic Bombs</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] According to a senior government official, the Qitai District of Xinjiang has uranium mines, the raw material for manufacturing atomic bombs.</p>
<h3>Deadline for US Loan: I Will Appeal for Extension</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco 11th Broadcast: China still hopes to obtain large-scale economic assistance from the United States, and it is expected that China will request the United States to extend the deadline for loans to China (June 30). There are less than three weeks left before the deadline, and the Chinese government has not yet applied to the Export-Import Bank for any part of the $500 million loan.</p>
<h3>Hong Lanyou to Fill the Vacancy on the Central Political Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held its 72nd meeting on the morning of the 11th. The committee members present were Zou Lu, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng and 36 others, chaired by Li Zonghuang. First, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang, and then the agenda was carried out, and the following important cases were passed: (1) The Northeast Party Affairs Steering Committee was abolished, (2) Lin Ruiling was additionally appointed as a member of the Central Women's Steering Committee, (3) Ma Bufang, Director of the Qinghai Provincial Party Department, was approved to resign from his concurrent position as Director, and the vacancy was succeeded by Ma Shaowu, (4) Bai Wenwei, a member of the Central Political Committee, passed away, and the vacancy was filled by Hong Lanyou.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Colonial Minister Actually Says: Macau Will Not Be Returned Without Bloodshed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lisbon, 11th] Portuguese Colonial Minister Durão stated when receiving the Macau delegation on the 11th: Portugal will never return Macau to China unless blood is shed in Macau. Portugal will take measures to correct any Portuguese laws that the people of Macau do not agree with. Durão also said: Similarly, he is sure that Portugal will still reside in India. Unless thousands of white and colored Portuguese fight in India for defense, the Portuguese flag will never be lowered in India. He firmly believes that in the changes in India, Portugal's sovereignty in India can still be safe and sound.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] At the Information Bureau's press conference on the 11th, when asked "Has China formally negotiated with the Portuguese government regarding the recovery of Macau?", Zhang Yuan-chang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied: Regarding this matter, "No comment."</p>
<h3>Economic Reform Plan: The Primary Focus is on Reducing Deficits; Methods for Levying Property Tax are Being Drafted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan held a press conference at 4:30 p.m. on the 11th. Director Dong Xian'guang answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that during the recent arrest incident, President Zhang and other government officials were unaware of the details. What is Director Dong's opinion on this?</p>
<p>Answer: The recent arrests were based on Article 5 of the Measures for Maintaining Social Order promulgated by the National Government on May 19, which authorizes local authorities to take effective measures to prevent and control social order and public security in emergencies. The implementation of this order in various places is reported to the central government in detail afterwards. The rumor that President Zhang and other government officials were unaware is unfounded.</p>
<p>Question: Can you elaborate on the nature and main points of the proposed property tax? On what principles will property be estimated, and will this property tax apply uniformly to all types of property?</p>
<p>Answer: The government is drafting methods for levying property tax, and the principles for estimating property and classifying property are still under study.</p>
<h3>All Sincere Peace Plans are Welcome by the Government</h3>
<p>Question: What attitude does the government take towards the peace plan drafted by the Political Consultative Council? Is the government willing to accept the Political Consultative Council's recommendations, abandon any preconditions, and reopen negotiations with the Communist Party?</p>
<p>Answer: I would like to remind everyone again that the government has never closed the door to peace negotiations, and welcomes any practical and feasible peace plan. The Chinese Communist Party has already expressed its rejection of the Political Consultative Council's peace proposal through its propaganda organs. The June 5 broadcast of the Communist Xinhua News Agency accused the entire Political Consultative Council of being a reactionary group supporting "civil war," and said that the Political Consultative Council's call for peace was entirely false. The Communist Party's attitude is sufficient to show who should bear the responsibility for the domestic conflict.</p>
<p>Question: There is much speculation about President Zhang's new economic reform plan. Can you explain the actual situation and current state of the plan in detail? What are the details of President Zhang's new economic reform plan?</p>
<p>Answer: The purpose of the economic reform plan proposed by President Zhang is to balance the national budget, primarily to reduce deficits, promote production, and increase tax revenue. Before the plan is approved by the State Council, it is not appropriate to report the details. The meeting of the National Economic Commission yesterday made some decisions on how to quickly sell state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet industries. People can use US Treasury bills to purchase all or part of the state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet industries designated for sale by the government. If the contractor purchases more than half of the shares of a certain state-owned enterprise run by the private sector, the government can first hand over the enterprise to the contractor for operation, and the government will temporarily retain the remaining shares and continue to sell them.</p>
<p>Communist Troops in the Northeast Adopt Positional Warfare Tactics</p>
<p>Question: What is the outlook for the military situation in the Northeast?</p>
<p>Answer: In Changchun, Sipingjie, and Shenyang, the Communist troops attacking the National Army have changed their previous mobile guerrilla tactics and adopted positional warfare. This is an unprecedented change in the Communist troops' combat methods. You may recall that the Communist troops attempted to cross the south bank of the Songhua River three times, and suffered heavy losses in late April and retreated in embarrassment. It is remarkable that they have been able to quickly complete their reorganization and replenishment in a short period of time, and bring in better and newer weapons than before, and launch a large-scale attack again.</p>
<h3>Our Government is Studying the Issue of a Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] At the Information Bureau's press conference, Zhang Yuan-chang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, answered diplomatic inquiries as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the Chinese government's attitude towards the recent request made by the new Japanese Prime Minister regarding the Ryukyu Islands?</p>
<p>Answer: The entire issue of treaties with Japan is under study by our government, but at present I will not comment on this matter.</p>
<p>Question: Does the editorial in the Dagangbao on the 7th of this month on the Vietnam issue reflect the Chinese government's opinion? It is said that the Vietnamese Kuomintang "is naturally supported by China." Is this true? If so, in what aspects is it supported by China? Please also inform us.</p>
<p>Answer: The Chinese government does not currently support any party in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Question: According to press reports, some fishing boats of "a certain country" have been detained in Yingkou Port. Can you please confirm or deny this? Are there any provisions in international law or Chinese law that stipulate that foreign ships should be detained when entering Chinese territorial waters?</p>
<p>Answer: I have no information about this report.</p>
<p>Question: Has the inspection team sent by the Chinese government to Lushun-Dalian sent any reports? If reports have been received, please inform us of the treatment the team received from the local people and authorities (Soviet and local authorities).</p>
<p>Answer: The Lushun-Dalian inspection team arrived in Lushun about a week ago, but has not yet gone to Dalian. The inspection work is currently underway, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a detailed report.</p>
<p>Question: What is the Chinese government's attitude towards the current situation in Hungary?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no Chinese diplomatic representative in Hungary, but the situation in Hungary is being closely monitored by our government.</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai Invited to Visit the Capital: Xu Chuanlin to Take Office as a State Councilor Early Next Week</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The authorities are handling the Xinjiang incident with great caution and will invite leaders of various parties to discuss it in the coming days. Mr. Zhang Junmai has already taken a car to the capital last night at the invitation of the highest authority. When reporters met Mr. Zhang yesterday, they asked him about his views on this incident. He replied: The nature of the problem is serious, and I dare not answer lightly before studying it. A detailed investigation should be conducted first. When asked about the content of the so-called unified interpretation of the constitution, Mr. Zhang said: For example, the political system of our country, whether it is a presidential system or a responsible cabinet system, should have a unified interpretation.

<h3>The National Government Committee Will Establish Three Committees: Political, Economic, and Legal; Candidates for Chairmen are Being Selected</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The National Government Committee will establish a Political Committee, an Economic Committee, and a Legal Committee. Candidates for chairmen are being selected. This is because the reorganized National Government Committee holds a State Council meeting every two weeks to discuss policy guidelines, military and political plans, legislative principles, and handle financial plans and the national budget for each department and other important political affairs that are too numerous to handle. It is also difficult to conduct detailed research on some cases that must be reviewed in advance. According to the regulations of the National Government Committee meeting, various proposals can be submitted to the subcommittee for review and deliberation. Now, in order to meet the actual needs, it is decided to establish three standing committees. The Political Committee is responsible for handling cases involving domestic affairs, foreign affairs, transportation, education, etc. The Economic Committee is responsible for handling cases involving finance, economy, finance, food, agriculture, and forestry, etc. The Legal Committee is responsible for handling various laws and regulations and legislative principles, etc. It is reported that the candidates for chairmen of each committee may be Chen Bufu for the Political Committee, Shao Lizi for the Economic Committee, and Wang Chonghui for the Legal Committee.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolia, Less Than Two Years After Independence</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia, which has not been independent from China for two full years, has sent troops to invade Chinese territory. The political and diplomatic situation in Xinjiang is extremely complex. Since the Yining Incident, the government has spent great effort to arrange it properly. Now that Outer Mongolian troops have invaded Xinjiang, they certainly have some intentions. Outer Mongolia, a vast land of more than 600,000 square miles, has been included in the Chinese territory for more than 2,000 years, but the relationship between the two has never been clearly stated. It was not until the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty that lengthy articles were drafted and the relationship between China and Mongolia was officially determined. Although it was only a unilateral edict of Emperor Jiaqing, it was highly valued by the Mongols and became an internationally effective document. After the Guangxu period, the Qing court's policy of governing Mongolia was unsatisfactory. At the same time, Tsarist Russia colluded with the Living Buddha and encouraged resistance to governance, so there was a gradual phenomenon of disintegration.</p>
<p>Although Outer Mongolia is a remote and desolate wilderness, it is a natural collection center with unparalleled abundance of meat and fur, and with a vast land and sparse population, it has a high potential for development. Therefore, it aroused the covetousness of Tsarist Russia. Later, Tsarist Russia managed Siberia, built the Middle East Railway, and incited Outer Mongolia to become independent.</p>
<p>After the first stage of the Soviet revolution was completed, it gradually adopted the attitude of the Tsar towards Mongolia and replaced it. First, it established its administrative system, changing the Khanate banners and alliances into new administrative systems such as Aimags, Horool, Sum, Baks, and Arban. It implemented a new economic policy suitable for nomadic society, and Sovietized everything in Mongolia. It also supplied modern weapons and trained Mongolian troops. During the border conflict between the Mongolian army and the Japanese "Manchukuo" army in 1936, the Soviet army also entered Mongolia.</p>
<p>On the eve of Japan's surrender, China and the Soviet Union signed a friendship agreement in Moscow, deciding that Outer Mongolia would hold a referendum after the end of the war to decide whether to become independent or not. This is based on the principle of the founding father of supporting weak and small nations. In November of that year, Lei Fazhang and others flew to Kulun (Ulaanbaatar) to observe the referendum election. On January 5 of last year, the government officially recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is our country's external solid treasury in the northwest, with a mild climate and abundant products, far above the northeast. In the past, Xinjiang had a very delicate position due to geographical and diplomatic influences. Now it is refreshing its politics and appeasing all ethnic groups. Recently, the appointment of Masud Sabri as the new provincial chairman is a step towards benefiting the neighbors and pacifying the people. The surprising incident of Outer Mongolian cavalry invading Baitashan is far from our country's desire to recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia, which is regrettable!</p>
<p>In terms of geographical situation, Mongolia and Xinjiang are characterized by the Altai Mountains extending from the northwest to the southeast, with the northwest being high and steep and the southeast slopes being gentle. From Zaksak to the Jungar region, there is a flat sand that cannot be defended. Nomadic peoples live in it, traveling hundreds of miles a day, which is considered commonplace. Therefore, once something happens in Xinjiang, it is easily controlled by Outer Mongolia, which is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>How the fate of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia was decided, history has told us. Now that Mongol troops have invaded Xinjiang, its future evolution is even more worthy of attention from the people of the country.</p>

<p>[United Press Nanjing, 11th] Vice Chairman of the National Government, Sun Ke, stated in a conversation with United Press reporters today that he advocates strict, long-term control of Japanese territory and people to prevent ancient theories such as racial superiority and militarism from resurfacing in the world, especially in the Far East. It is said that before Japan has genuinely trained a generation with thoughts and beliefs in peace and democracy, the Chinese government is extremely concerned about the possible revival of Japanese national power. He believes that General MacArthur will not mistakenly believe that Japan can be transformed into a democratic nation in a matter of months. This is a work of many years, certainly not achievable in a few months. If we want to completely eliminate the future threat of Japan to peace, we must produce and train the next generation. China demands that at least until the peace treaty is drafted and approved, complete military control and occupation of Japan should continue. Part of the supervision should continue indefinitely to ensure that the militarists still present in Japan cannot make a comeback. China has more reasons than other countries to understand and care about Japan, so we urge the countries concerned to avoid granting freedom too early, so as not to provide a new base for its anti-democratic leaders.</p>
<p>"Jinghua Bell":</p>
<p>Former Dean of Education of the Army Artillery School, Zou Zuohua, commissioned a giant bell to be cast by the Xia Shengxing Foundry outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) to celebrate the 50th birthday of Chairman Chiang. It was named "Jinghua Bell", seven feet high, five feet in diameter, and weighing over a thousand catties. Zou Zuohua himself wrote the inscription on the bell: "On the great birthday of Principal Chiang Kai-shek, the memorial hall is completed, adorned with a pavilion, the pavilion is tied to a bell, the bell is tied to an inscription, the inscription reads: His功盖天下兮天比崇 (His merits cover the world, and the heavens are comparable), 寿高天下兮徂徕松 (His longevity surpasses the world, like the pine of Mount Tai), 福被天下兮民景从 (His blessings are bestowed upon the world, and the people admire and follow), 声满天下兮启瞶矇 (His fame fills the world, enlightening the ignorant), 永不朽兮垂無終 (Eternally immortal, enduring without end)." When the casting was completed, the enemy had already approached Nanjing. The owner of the foundry buried the bell underground, so it remained unharmed. After the victory, it was unearthed from the soil. However, the owner of the foundry had passed away, and his wife was willing to donate it to the government through the Nanjing Municipal Council without asking for any compensation (because 300 yuan out of the 800 yuan casting fee agreed upon before the war had already been received). Now the Nanjing Municipal Government will build a bell pavilion in Wuzhou Park and erect a monument to record the event. The picture on the right is the full image of the "Jinghua Bell".</p>

<h3>The Incident of Outer Mongolian Troops Invading Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Reports from Chinese and foreign news agencies have stated for days: A battalion of Outer Mongolian cavalry, equipped with military vehicles, light and heavy weapons, under the cover of aircraft allegedly marked with Soviet symbols, began invading Baita Mountain, 350 li northeast of Qitai in Xinjiang, on the 5th of this month. Our defense forces, with the responsibility of defending the territory, have resisted, and the fighting is ongoing. It is also reported that the Outer Mongolian cavalry has wedged 600 li deep into our territory, and nearby towns have been bombed, causing casualties among soldiers and civilians. Our diplomatic authorities have lodged a protest with the Outer Mongolian government through Soviet Ambassador Petrov. In today's turbulent Eurasian situation, the sudden report of a serious alarm on the border of Xinjiang, China, naturally deserves our deep attention.</p>
<p>Xinjiang, formerly known as the Western Regions, is surrounded by high mountains on all sides, with the Tianshan Mountains running through it. Judging from the overall situation, it can defend the Great Wall in the east, shield Mongolia in the north, protect Tibet in the south, and rely on the Pamirs in the west for defense, residing on the spine of the Chinese mainland, like building a commanding structure on a high house. If it is secure, it will protect China and consolidate our borders. If it is not secure, the Guanzhong region will be restricted, the Hehuang region will lose its defenses, and even a small movement will shake the Central Plains. Therefore, the Han Dynasty seized thirty-six countries to sever the right arm of the Xiongnu, and the Tang Dynasty opened the Anxi and Beiting Protectorates to control the various barbarians. The Mongol Yuan Dynasty rose in the Altai Mountains, seized the Western Regions, and eventually destroyed the Song and Jin dynasties and gained control of the world. During the prosperous Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, expeditions were conducted against the Jungar and Hui tribes, and the land extended for tens of thousands of miles. Later, Britain and Russia strengthened their management, and the tribes around Xinjiang, such as the Kyrgyz, Kokand, Andijan, Kazakhs, Bukhara, etc., not only changed their names and surnames, but also had hidden forces, causing many concerns in the western border. Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang's Gobi Desert are intertwined. Since the fall of Kulun in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), Outer Mongolia established a government and Tannu Uriankhai declared independence, and from then on, the northern frontier defenses were completely lost, as precarious as a pile of eggs. Fortunately, China and Mongolia have been at peace for the past twenty years. This sudden invasion of the Xinjiang border by Outer Mongolia seems to be a planned action. We are unwilling to make premature judgments about future developments. However, the occurrence of this unfortunate event has hidden dangers that are worrisome. Reflecting on the past and present, we find it difficult to remain silent.</p>
<p>First, the invasion of Outer Mongolia is in the Altai region of northern Xinjiang. None of the Xinjiang incidents in the past ten years or so did not originate in the Altai region. What is different about this time compared to the past "civil unrest" is that the Outer Mongolian army's invasion is planned and is not simply an internal ethnic issue in Xinjiang. Altai is the fifth administrative region in northeastern Xinjiang, with the district government located in Chenghua, formerly known as Chenghua Temple. It is located south of the Altai Mountains, bordering the Soviet Union in the west, Outer Mongolia in the east, and reaching Dihua in the south, serving as an important border town in northern Xinjiang. The Altai region is vast, rich in mineral resources, and has a population of 63,040, with the Kazakh ethnicity accounting for 53,352 people. When the Kazakhs rebelled, they repeatedly harassed Mulei River, Qitai, Fuyuan, Fukang, Gand, and other places, leading to unrest in Dihua. In the May 1945 incident, rioters occupied Chenghua, and in August, the rioters who occupied Tacheng came in droves. The counties in the Altai region were looted, and the people fled to Qitai and other places in the First District. The Altai Administrative Commissioner's Office was originally located in Chenghua, but due to external pressure, it retreated to Baita Mountain in mid-April of this year. Based on this, it seems that the situation in the Altai region has long been precarious. If the Outer Mongolian army's offensive is not stopped, the disaster of war will inevitably extend to the entire northern Xinjiang, which would constitute a serious problem.</p>
<p>Second, Outer Mongolia was originally part of our country's Outer Mongolia region. After the fall of Kulun in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), it was instigated by others to claim independence and was protected by Imperial Russia. After the Russian Revolution, Outer Mongolia once canceled its independence and submitted to our country, but soon酝酿 (wùn niàng; brewed) independence again, establishing the "Mongolian People's Republic," protected and guided by the Soviet Union. On August 14, 1945, China and the Soviet Union signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance." In order to preserve Soviet friendship, our country exchanged notes with the Soviet Union, confirming that Outer Mongolia, after Japan's defeat, would be recognized as independent when its desire for independence was confirmed by a referendum. On January 15, 1946, our government officially recognized the independence of the Outer Mongolian state, but diplomatic relations have not yet been established. Outer Mongolia is politically independent in form, but its military and diplomatic affairs are originally bound by the "Soviet-Mongolian Protocol." Therefore, the actions and development of the Outer Mongolian army are worth paying attention to because of the Soviet Union's involvement.</p>
<p>Third, Sino-Soviet relations are based on the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance." For several years, we have been hoping that Sino-Soviet relations can improve because of this new foundation. According to the spirit of this treaty, the Soviet Union would have stated that it has no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs. In recent years, the internal turmoil in Xinjiang has been handled reasonably by the former Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, and the Soviet Union's attitude has been unquestionable. This invasion of northern Xinjiang by the Outer Mongolian army is an unfortunate event, whether from the perspective of Sino-Soviet relations or Soviet-Mongolian relations. From the Soviet Union's perspective, the Soviet Union should prevent the Outer Mongolian army from invading Xinjiang through legitimate channels to avoid escalating the situation. From China's perspective, the Chinese government should use reason and make decisive decisions to prevent the Outer Mongolian army from advancing further, both diplomatically and in action. The situation has not yet developed further. The Outer Mongolian army, which has invaded 600 li into northern Xinjiang, should withdraw as soon as possible to maintain the friendly relations between China and Mongolia.</p>
<p>At the same time, we believe that before the Xinjiang local authorities accurately report the truth, all parties should not have emotional overreactions to this unfortunate event. We must remain calm and trust that the government can take necessary measures to stop the Outer Mongolian army's actions through legitimate channels.</p>

<h3>Japan's Emergency Economic Measures Officially Announced Yesterday by Katayama and Wada</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The Japanese government officially announced the Katayama Cabinet's emergency economic measures on the afternoon of the 11th.

The content of the measures is divided into eight items, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Eradicate Black Markets, Increase Tax Revenue</p>
<p>(1) Food: Rationalizing the rationing and purchase ratios, thoroughly eradicating "black market restaurants"; (2) Finance: Improving official prices, smoothly investing in important industries; (3) Wages: Increasing rations for laborers, seeking to increase real wages; (4) Finance: In order to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, seeking to establish funds and increase tax revenue; (5) Production: Ensuring funds for important industries, and implementing piecework pay for enterprises, and rationalizing the allocation of workers; (6) Labor Efficiency: Improving labor welfare facilities in factories, and strengthening unemployment countermeasures;</p>
<p>Revitalize Exports, Promote Production</p>

<p>Japanese People's Reactions Vary</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] Since the Katayama Cabinet announced emergency economic measures, Japanese people here have the following feelings about them: (1) The militarists, who were one of the parties responsible for this war, have already been dissolved, and due to the announcement of these emergency measures, the power of the financial groups will also be weakened, but the Katayama Cabinet has not touched the bureaucrats, who are the central force, which is a great regret. (2) The most necessary things for Japan to increase production and stabilize life are coal and electricity. If these two cannot be resolved, then any policy will not achieve practical results; (3) Measures to prevent the recent possibility of three million unemployed workers are not sufficient, so the Katayama Cabinet is not a true socialist cabinet.</p>

<h3>The Process of Kagesa Teizo Supporting the Wang Regime</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Tokyo International Military Tribunal. The court opened today to read a copy of Kagesa Teizo's testimony, which stated that in 1939, the Japanese government provided Wang Jingwei with 40 million Japanese yen to help him establish a pro-Japanese regime. On the way from Vietnam to Shanghai with Wang, he heard that the Japanese side had proposed sending terrorists to Shanghai to protect Wang, but he strongly opposed it, and this move was not realized. The Japanese side did not take strict precautions in Tianjin and Shanghai to protect Wang. He then presided over the so-called "Kagesa Agency" in Shanghai. The Japanese Army Ministry and the Foreign Ministry's China Affairs Bureau both contacted this agency to maintain contact with Wang. Kagesa's testimony may be the background testimony before the defendants begin to defend the Tripartite Pact concluded by Germany, Italy, and Japan in 1940. It is expected that defendant lawyer Kneenham will begin to briefly describe the circumstances of the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact tomorrow. The court also decided to suspend the trial for six weeks from June 23.</p>

<h3>The Changshu and Wuxi Gangs of Major Drug Traffickers; Masterminds and Accomplices Captured in One Fell Swoop; The Truth About the Gunfire at Thirteen-Story Building at Midnight Comes to Light</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] On the night of the 7th of this month, a Ning dealer was shot and captured in the Hua Xiang Apartment on the thirteenth floor of Guilin Road (formerly Rue Mère de Sion). In order to capture all the criminals in the case, the police department only completely solved and published the case yesterday. The detective section of the police department learned that there were two major gangs in the city's drug trafficking organization, one was the Wuxi gang, led by Chen Yaobin from Wuxi. One is the Changzhou gang, hosted by Shi Yiping. Zhang Ningqiu. The two gangs cooperate closely on weekdays, and often transport large quantities of morphine and opium from the north to Shanghai for profit. After more than a month of investigation by the police department, it was learned that Chen lived at No. 71, Lane 125, South Shaanxi Road. He usually behaved generously and often went in and out of the apartments and No. 28, Lane 117, Shandong Road. Because there was no concrete evidence yet, he was not immediately arrested. On the 6th of this month, the police department believed that the time was ripe, so it dispatched all the detective section personnel to search and arrest them in all directions at the same time. The police department has confirmed that the Changzhou gang wanted criminal Zhang Xiaoqiu lives on Yueyang Road. They immediately arrested Zhang and his accomplices Zhang Jinkang at the address. The two criminals confessed that the principal offender, Shi Yiping, lived at No. 325 Hua Xiang Apartment. They immediately rushed to arrest Shi and left police officers guarding inside No. 325. At 2:00 a.m. on the 7th, Chen Yaobin came as expected and was caught without a struggle. Section Chief Feng Xiushan of the police department then took Chen to walk downstairs. Unexpectedly, when they reached the second floor, Chen suddenly took advantage of his strength and punched Section Chief Feng to the ground, ran downstairs, and fled out the door. Police officers had been lying in ambush and surrounding the Hua Xiang Apartment in advance. At this time, seeing someone running out of the building in a panic, they fired a shot at his lower abdomen, and Chen fell to the ground in response. At the same time, police officers had also gone to Chen's residence on South Shaanxi Road, and accomplices Yu Youting and Chen's driver Jiang Miaoyuan were captured. A large bag of morphine was also found in the house.</p>
<p>At the same time, Xue Zongming, Gao Huixing, Zhao Zhiming, and Gao Ziqing were subsequently arrested in the secret organization for external liaison at No. 117, Shandong Road. Five catties of opium and seven morphine tablets were confiscated. In addition, Chen's younger brothers Chen Qizong and Chen Yaoming were also important criminals in the gang. Chen Yaozong was arrested by police officers at No. 126, Nanyang Road, according to the confession of the previous criminals, while Chen Yaoming had already fled after hearing the news. He Jiying and Zhu Xionglei, who were responsible for selling drugs to other places for the two gangs, were also arrested later. A total of thirteen principal and accessory criminals have been arrested. The police department believes that the two major drug trafficking organizations in Changshu and Wuxi in this city have now been completely cracked. The investigation has come to an end, and confessions are being strictly interrogated. They will be transferred to the local court for investigation and handling in accordance with special criminal cases.</p>

Therefore, the organization of the Conscription Association is very necessary. According to laws and regulations, the Conscription Association should be jointly organized by all sectors of the local community.</p>
<p>Military Service Matters - Strive for Openness</p>
<p>Mayor Wu continued, saying that the tasks of the Conscription Association are mainly three: (1) To assist the government in publicizing military service matters, so that the people understand the conscription system. (2) Regarding matters of current active duty exemptions, the association should publicly review them to avoid fraud and harassment. (3) The association should also handle matters related to preferential treatment for the families of serving soldiers, as well as soliciting donations from public-spirited people. In short, the biggest task of the Conscription Association is only to seek openness in military service matters, so that there is no harassment of the people. The government and the citizens have great hopes for the Conscription Association, and believe that the work will be carried out with satisfactory results in the future.</p>
<p>Following Director Zhang's report, the conference began to discuss association affairs and decided: (1) To publicly elect Du Yuesheng as the chairman of the association, (2) The address of the association will be located in the Municipal Council on Tanggu Road, (3) The date of the first standing committee meeting will be determined by the chairman.

<h3>Knitwear Industry Dispute Mediation Unsuccessful; 300 Male and Female Workers Surround Police Station; Zhou Xuexiang Rushes to Bail Out Seven Detained Representatives</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Due to a dispute over the cost of living index, the labor and management of the knitwear industry in Districts 1, 2, and 3 have recently been unsuccessfully mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. Yesterday afternoon, the two parties were convened again for negotiations. The reason is that the industry's business was sluggish last year, and it was agreed that the monthly calculation would be 85% of the cost of living index of the previous month. After the index was frozen starting in February, it was issued in full, but the differential was still discounted, with 20,000 issued when it was 73,000, and 32,000 issued when it was 110,000. It was also stipulated that if the index exceeded 12,000 times after the index was unfrozen, the 85% discount would be restored. The agreement will end at the end of August this year. Today, the cost of living index is unfrozen. The workers believe that they are losing too much according to the agreement and cannot maintain their livelihood, so they requested to calculate it at 14,800 times, which the employers did not allow. During the negotiations yesterday, the workers made a concession to 14,000 times and then a discount of 85%, but the employers still did not allow it, and the negotiations became deadlocked. When mediating, more than 300 male and female knitwear workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to await news. The bureau believed that there was a suspicion of gathering people to threaten, and ordered the workers to withdraw, otherwise they would not be mediated. At the same time, it notified the Songshan Police Station to send police to maintain order. After the workers withdrew outside the bureau, the negotiations were still fruitless. The workers were therefore anxious, and the union representatives could not dissuade them. The police station then took seven labor representatives to the police station: Tang Hanbai, Xu Guannan, Chen Fusheng, and Qian Jinkang from District 1; Fang Xiong and Yu Tongju from District 2; and Li Ding from District 3. At the same time, the employers' representatives were summoned. Seeing that the representatives were taken away, the workers rushed to the police station together. The police station then dispatched police cars and a large number of military police to maintain order. The workers surrounded the police station and did not disperse for a long time. Later, Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union rushed to the scene and bailed out the seven workers from the police station. The labor-management dispute has not been resolved, and the matter will be discussed again at the Social Affairs Bureau today. The workers dispersed at about 12:00 midnight.</p>
<p>According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, the number of representatives should be limited when labor and management negotiate, and they cannot gather people to threaten, otherwise they will not be mediated, and they will be dealt with strictly according to the law. If the union leadership is incompetent, the union will be dissolved if necessary.</p>
<h3>Index Dispute - Almost Impossible to Index - Tofu Disappears - Sick from Hunger - Director Lu Visits the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau to Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The labor-management dispute caused by the cost of living index continues to spread. Director Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures for this problem. According to Fan Zhenbang, chief of the Mediation Section of the Labor Department: Some employers did not consult with the labor party, or ignored the labor party's request for consultation, and directly notified all members by the same industry association to pay at 14,800 times, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers and led to strikes, work slowdowns, and other behaviors, which is also one of the main reasons for the dispute. The government will take appropriate measures to deal with workers who strike or slow down work.</p>
<p>Tofu industry workers were refused by the employers for demanding salary according to the cost of living index. The workers launched a strike on the 7th. On the same day, several tofu shops were destroyed because the workers did not strike, and three workers were arrested by the police station on suspicion of inciting a labor unrest. Some employers still maintain their work independently, and after holding out for two days, they were forced to close down yesterday, and there was no tofu to buy in the vegetable markets. After persuasion from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the workers may resume work today, and the wage issue will be mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau within a few days.</p>
<p>Due to a cost of living index dispute, three male and female workers at the Jiuchang Weaving Factory in Nanshi have become ill from starvation. The Social Affairs Bureau sent staff to persuade them to send the patients to the hospital for treatment, and cooked porridge and bought bread to persuade the workers to eat. Mediation will be carried out within a few days.</p>
<p>Parasol, Ink, and Writing Brush Strikes and Work Slowdowns</p>
<p>Because the employers announced that they would send representatives to the central government to appeal, and temporarily issued wages according to the April index, the workers of the parasol industry went on strike. Some of the workers in the ink and writing brush group of the pen and stationery industry also slowed down work yesterday.</p>
<p>Seven Handkerchief Factories Slow Down Work Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>Because the employers of the handkerchief industry refused to issue wages according to the May index, seven factories, including Yitong, China, and Huaqiang, slowed down work starting yesterday. The Handkerchief Group of the Dyeing and Weaving Workers' Union of the Third District is scheduled to hold a meeting at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss solutions and persuade the workers to resume work first.</p>
<p>Machine Industry Disputes Rise Again</p>
<p>The Machine Industry Association recently notified factories to temporarily issue wages at 14,800 times, which once again caused dissatisfaction among workers and led to disputes. Yesterday afternoon, the workers sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to appeal.</p>
<p>Antai Employees Surround the Factory</p>
<p>Due to a cost of living index dispute, more than 200 employees of the Antai Ironworks on Xikang Road went on strike yesterday morning and surrounded the factory. The Garrison Command sent personnel to the factory to maintain order, and the Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to persuade them. The workers resumed work in the afternoon and awaited mediation.</p>
<h3>French Pseudo Radio Station Director Transferred to Original Bail for Rescheduling of Trial</h3>

<h3>Two Routes Adopted: Ticket Purchase Order Certificate to Prevent Scalpers, Changing Color Daily</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the two routes, scalpers have become active again, not only harming traveling passengers but also affecting the order of various stations and local public security. It has been specially decided to adopt ticket purchase order certificates starting today, with which to exchange for train tickets. The certificates are divided into seven colors, changing one color for each day of the week. The price for second-class tickets is 10,000 yuan per certificate, and for third and fourth-class tickets, it is 5,000 yuan per certificate. When exchanging for train tickets, refunds will be made for overpayments and supplements will be required for underpayments based on the number of tickets purchased. All major stations on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes will handle this accordingly, except for first-class tickets and reserved-seat tickets, which will still be sold at the original ticket windows. The Shanghai Station has also added a waiting room that can accommodate more than 2,400 people. The ticket purchase order certificates will be sold at the entrance of the waiting room, sold upon arrival, which can be considered fast and convenient.</p>
<h3>Sino-U.S. Wireless Telephone Fee: Twelve U.S. Dollars for Three Minutes, Formal Calls Expected to Begin on July 1</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city's telecommunications traffic with international and domestic locations is becoming increasingly developed and convenient due to the application of new machinery and equipment. The International Wireless Radio Station, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, purchased the latest "single-line telephone machine" from the United States, which has recently arrived in the city. The radio station is now actively preparing for Sino-U.S. and Sino-Philippine wireless telephone services. The former has been tested several times with excellent results, and the latter is also being tested. It is scheduled to begin formal calls on July 1. At that time, it will contact the Shanghai Telephone Company so that citizens who want to make calls do not have to go to the radio station in person. They can leisurely pick up the phone and talk to relatives and friends across the ocean, as if speaking in the same room. As for the cost of Sino-U.S. calls, it is said to be approximately twelve U.S. dollars per three minutes, which, converted at the legal exchange rate, is actually more than 140,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Keyboard Automatically Rises and Falls</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the International Wireless Radio Station used "five-unit" wireless teletypewriters from U.S. military surplus materials to launch wireless teletype service, the speed of telegraphic communication between this city and international locations, in terms of receiving in Shanghai, and in terms of avoiding errors, has both had remarkable results. A reporter visited the radio station yesterday. There are currently three of these teletypewriters. Two of them are connected to the RCA Wireless Communication Company and the [unclear] Wireless Communication Company, respectively, to send and receive commercial and private telegrams. The other one is used for sending and receiving news telegrams. Each teletypewriter includes both receiving and sending parts, and its structure is very complex. When the San Francisco side sends a telegram, the keyboard of the teletypewriter here automatically rises and falls, typing out the original text, which can be taken off and delivered to the line person immediately without going through the procedure of copying.</p>
<p>Studying Expansion of Equipment</p>
<p>When sending a telegram, the original text is first typed on a paper tape about half an inch wide. This type of typewriter is different from ordinary ones, with different arrangements of tiny needles on its keys. Therefore, different letters on the paper tape have different holes. This paper tape is loaded onto the transmitter, and when the machine is turned on, different radio waves are emitted due to the different holes, causing the keys on the receiver in San Francisco to rise and fall, typing out the original text. This wireless teletype service has not been in operation for long, and the International Radio Station is still studying how to increase efficiency and expand equipment. It is reported that the Global Wireless Radio Company also recently intends to contact the International Radio Station to handle wireless teletype services. However, the company's teletypewriters use a "six-unit" system, which is slightly different from the "five-unit" system used by RCA and others. One of these machines was tested in Nanjing the night before last, communicating with Ventura City in California, USA. Seven more are currently stored in customs. Some will be sold to the International Radio Station, and some will be sold to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau to open wireless teletype service between Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Guangzhou.</p>

<h3>Director of the Shipping Administration Bureau Returns from Inspection</h3>
<p>Huang Muzong, Director of the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau, and others, accompanied by Manager Xu of the Dafeng Shipping Bureau, departed yesterday morning on the Shenhua landing craft to inspect the site of the Dafeng ship accident. They arrived at their destination at 4:00 PM and returned to Shanghai around 8:00 PM. According to the information obtained from the inspection: (1) The ship's position is approximately 31 degrees 34 and a half minutes north latitude and 121 degrees 17 minutes east longitude, about 2,400 feet from the Upper Baibusha Buoy and about two li from the south bank of the Yangtze River. (2) The ship appears to be lying flat on the riverbed and has not overturned, but it is feared that it has been penetrated from east to west. Whether it is worth salvaging remains to be determined after actual verification by divers. (3) Upon arrival, there was a fishing boat fishing there. According to the fishermen, no floating bodies have been found on the water surface since the day of the accident, and no objects have been caught in the nets, which have been set for two days. (4) The Dafeng ship departed from Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the eighth. At that time, the wind was calm and the waves were gentle. At 1:00 AM the next morning, a violent storm suddenly arose and intensified. It was originally planned to return to Wusong, but the flood tide was rapid and the wind was against it, making it difficult to turn around. It immediately adapted to the situation and sailed to the Hanshui River near Liuhe to take shelter. Unfortunately, the wind and waves were fierce, and the hull leaked. Although the crew of the ship worked hard to rescue, it was beyond human resistance. It was delayed until about 2:00 PM on the ninth, when the entire ship sank. Fortunately, the Yongzhang oil tanker passed by and made efforts to rescue, so there were not many casualties, which was considered a stroke of luck in misfortune.</p>

However, as soon as the last game was over, some players from Tongji High School incited the students of the school to make unwarranted accusations against the organizers. The momentum was fierce. He Jianshan, the physical education teacher, did not properly persuade them, but participated in the fun, which is a pity.

<h3>Opening a Path for Silk Exports - Exchanging Silk for Rayon from the United States - One Pound of Raw Silk Can Be Exchanged for Six to Eight Pounds of Rayon</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The government's loan of 250 billion yuan for cocoons is intended to produce 30,000 dan of silk for export. Based on the current production costs, the price of this export silk would need to reach 25 million to 30 million yuan per dan. However, the US market, the only destination for our country's raw silk, currently has a market price of only 4.45 yuan per pound. Converted at the official exchange rate, this only reaches over 7 million yuan per dan, a significant difference, and export costs are too high. Moreover, given the current surplus of raw silk in the United States and the availability of cheap raw silk from Japan, there is considerable concern about the prospects for this export silk. However, according to a relevant source, this batch of export raw silk is actually the only resource for obtaining foreign exchange. While current export costs are unfavorable, the method can be changed to exchange one-third of our produced raw silk for rayon from the United States, thereby supplying the country's annual consumption with low-priced rayon. Because the US market price for raw silk is 4.4 yuan per pound, while rayon is only 0.6 to 0.9 yuan per pound. Therefore, one pound of raw silk in the US can be converted into six to eight pounds of rayon. Based on the current domestic market prices, raw silk is equivalent to 200,000 yuan per pound, while rayon is equivalent to 90,000 yuan per pound, with the difference between raw silk and rayon being just over one-fold. Therefore, if raw silk can be exported to the US in exchange for US rayon, it would be even more beneficial to our country than simply exporting raw silk to earn foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Selling Wind Sweeps the Market - Food Rice Prices Reported Lower and Lower - High-Quality White Rice in North City at 360,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Rice prices have been falling daily this week, and dropped another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan yesterday. Due to the heavy rain in recent days, shipping merchants are eager to sell off their stocks, fearing moisture evaporation, and the market is enveloped in a selling wind, creating a situation of oversupply. In addition, production prices are reported low, making it difficult to boost prices, and consumer confidence is weak, resulting in a sluggish market. Yesterday, a total of over 5,600 shi of rice arrived from the north and south. High-quality white rice fell to 360,000 yuan in the north city and 380,000 yuan in the south city. Thin rice was 385,000 yuan in the south city and 380,000 yuan in the north city.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, food rice prices soared, once approaching the 500,000 yuan mark. The authorities actively took measures to clear supply channels and strictly prohibit hoarding. At the same time, rice distribution was organized for factories, schools, and organizations, as well as subsidized rice sales for the poor, stabilizing public sentiment. With the approach of summer, food rice is prone to insect infestations and mold, and each household's storage is limited to meeting immediate needs, ceasing hoarding. Those holding goods are also seeking to sell, causing public sentiment to turn downward. According to general observations, rice prices can remain stable for a considerable period if there are no major stimuli.</p>
<p>Flour from Hankou has arrived, and the market is quiet. Local flour continues to decline by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, imported flour is weak, and bran falls by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cakes still lack real demand and are slowly declining by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans are oversupplied, appetite is very scarce, and prices have fallen sharply by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Green beans are difficult to find, plummeting by another 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Red beans linger in a weak state, gradually falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum continues to arrive from Hankou and continues to weaken by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Corn transactions are light and lack activity. Sesame seed arrivals and sales are both small, and there are no gains or losses for the time being. Raw peanuts from South China are reported to be quiet, and the local market outlook is stagnant, falling by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>New broad beans are not moving among the Hakka community, and local demand is limited, gradually declining. Goods from various ports along the Yangtze River and nearby Zhejiang Province are gradually pouring in, continuing to plummet by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan, and the situation remains lackluster. The oil market is making gradual progress, and sesame oil, soybean oil, and vegetable oil have all slightly increased by 10,000 yuan. Small-batch sesame oil has soared by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>New wheat arrivals are slightly up, but flour mills are rejecting them and not opening, still declining. The flour market is declining rapidly. The factories must reduce prices to 120,000 yuan before a transaction can be made. It will probably take a few more days before they can start operating.</p>
<h3>Fourth District Flour Industry Association Held Its General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporting on the Negotiation and Organization of Wheat Loans</p>

<p>The main agenda item yesterday was a report by the association's executive director on the negotiation and organization of wheat loans with the authorities, for the information of all. The loan term is three months, with interest of about 4%. The loan amount is based on each factory's production volume, with a loan amount of 1 billion yuan per 1,000 packages. The government will provide 70% of this loan, and the manufacturer will fill in 30%. Collateral can be in the form of real estate and production goods, including machinery and flour. The loan principle is currently awaiting final approval from the Four Banks Joint Office to determine the accepting bank and handle loan matters. If the loan principle is approved, each manufacturer will separately apply for loan procedures with the bank in their factory's location.</p>
<p>Other agenda items: (1) Approval of raising 1 billion yuan for the association's arts fund, shared equally according to each factory's production volume, approximately 5,000 yuan per package. (2) Discussion of the quota allocation of burlap bags. The flour industry has been allocated 240,000 pairs of burlap bags, of which the Fourth District Association can allocate 70%. (3) The United Federation of Flour Industry Associations, including the five district associations nationwide, is in the mature stage of preparation. The director of the preparation is Yang Guanbei, and the Fourth District Association has also nominated ten preparation members.

<h3>Total Amount of Cocoons Collected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Has Reached 180,000 Dan</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to information from the Silk Production and Sales Coordination Association: as of the 8th of this month, the total amount of fresh cocoons collected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has reached 180,000 dan. Jiangsu has 86,000 dan, and Zhejiang has 91,000 dan. Jiangsu still has 25,000 to 30,000 dan to be collected, but this will require the arrival of the requested increase of 30 billion yuan in loan funds before they can be fully collected. It is heard that Dong Zanyao, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, has personally approached the Executive Yuan and the Four Banks Joint Office to request approval for the remittance.</p>
<p>Another report: a related source indicated that if the cocoon loan can reach 300 billion yuan, it is estimated that Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces can collect 250,000 dan of fresh cocoons.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Hangzhou, 11th] Zhejiang Province has concluded its spring cocoon collection. It is estimated that 20,000 dan of local species cocoons and 75,000 dan of improved species cocoons have been collected, totaling 95,000 dan, using loans of 120 billion yuan. The results are still good.</p>
<h3>Summer Goods, Yarn Weaving Products, Are Selling Very Well</h3>
<p>Autumn goods, wool, serge, and overcoating fabrics, showed clear and hidden upward trends yesterday. Summer goods, such as voile and poplin, are mostly strong on the outside but weak on the inside. White serge, white straight tribute, white "er er ding" types have extremely dull sales. Yarn woven products, such as white canvas, white yarn twill, khaki, Baifu ne, Ai Hua ne, rainproof cloth, thread hemp cloth, etc., are selling well. Local and Nanjing merchants have considerable interest, and Chongqing and Rong merchants are also actively preparing. Pei Feng white canvas is trading at 21,000 yuan per yard, You Sheng Ai Hua ne at 24,000 yuan, Baifu ne at 15,000 yuan, Hua Yi thread hemp cloth at 14,000 yuan, and China Paramount red label rainproof cloth at 29,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Loan Agreements Have Reached 65 Companies</h3>

Only five or six have not yet signed. The increased loan amount has already remitted over 44 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Poor Sales of Fine Yarn</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were driven by the simplification of the ban on yarn and cloth transportation in Hankou and other places. Merchants from Guangdong and Hubei successively made purchases, and the market continued to rise. 20-count Double Horse yarn reached a high of 7.8 million yuan, and 42-count Blue Phoenix also reached a high of 12.6 million yuan. Subsequently, Shenxin Factory released over 100 bales of Double Horse yarn for sale at a price of 7.7 million yuan. At the same time, many brands of yarn, such as Tian Nu, Jin Shuang Ji, etc., were sold, and the market suddenly plummeted. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was priced at 12.25 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Special Variant Horse yarn was 8.55 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn was 7.72 million yuan, also up 170,000 yuan. The overall trend for the day was poor sales of fine yarn, and the market declined. 20-count yarn remained firm due to the brisk cloth market, and 16-count yarn benefited from purchases by cotton textile factories producing towels and bed sheets, and the market conditions were positive.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials for Soap, Candles, and Matches - Caustic Soda, Rawhide Powder, and Glue All Rise</h3>
<p>The trading of raw materials for soap and candles was good, with various parties making purchases, and the market became brisk. Monthly brand caustic soda reached a high of 7.2 million yuan per barrel, an increase of 200,000 yuan. Sales of American caustic soda were slow, with little change in the market. Sodium silicate rose by 1,000 yuan per pound to 2,300 yuan. Siding is currently unavailable, and market demand is strong, resulting in a shortage of supply, with a sharp increase of 400,000 yuan per dan to 3.4 million yuan. Other items such as coconut oil, vanilla oil, and rosin remained stable.</p>
<p>Due to reports that the authorities have approved and relaxed the import quota for raw materials for matches, various factories are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and have no intention of making purchases. The market trend is weak. Potassium chlorate fell to 29 million yuan per ton, a sharp drop of 2 million yuan. Sulfur also fell by 200,000 yuan, and zinc chloride was priced at 28 million yuan, also down 2 million yuan. Amber fell by 500,000 yuan, and the prices of red phosphorus, 100-pound kraft paper, 26-pound blue paper, and 35-pound green wrapping paper all fell. The only exception in the market is rawhide powder glue, which is in short supply and has strong demand, with the price per ton (5%) reaching 30 million yuan, a sharp increase of 5 million yuan. Manganese dioxide and fine glass powder are stable.</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchants Obtain Registration Cards</h3>

<h3>Quotas for the Rotation of Rayon Have Been Distributed by Various Associations</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Quota Allocation Department of the Import Control Commission has allocated the import quotas for rayon for the first and second quarters, each totaling US$565,000, for a total of US$1.13 million.

The allocation ratios are as follows: Hangzhou 27%, Suzhou 8.5%, Shengze 4.8%, Wuxi 0.5%, Shanghai 59.2% (including a Huzhou silk weaving factory with 23 weaving machines). This allocation ratio will be submitted to the Quota Allocation Department for review and approval within days.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales Are Slow, Prices Do Not Rise or Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 120-count Asahi rayon opened at 17.5 million yuan, hovering for a long time, with transactions at 600,000 yuan. The closing price at noon was 800,000 yuan for sale, but because actual sales were very slow, the final price offered was 500,000 yuan, selling at 600,000 yuan, resulting in the same price as the previous day. 150-count bright rayon had very few stocks on the market. Yesterday, the price for Asnia brand was 19 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for factory silk was very weak. Because there were more sellers than buyers, asking prices consistently softened. B-grade goods were transacted at 24.4 million yuan for five dan, bought by Tong Zhang. There were no other transactions heard for other grades. Single goods were also transacted yesterday for five dan, at 17.6 million yuan. Another dan was bid at 17 million yuan, 400,000 to 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was still falling. Dachen silk covers sold for 9 million yuan, and Huaqiang silk covers were transacted at 8.8 million yuan, 100,000 yuan less than the previous day. Dachen checkered crepe opened at 34,100 yuan, and after many sales, the price dropped all the way down. A transaction was made in the middle at 3,700 yuan, and the final transaction was at 3,400 yuan, 600 yuan less than the previous day. Alternate-day transactions opened at 3,700 yuan. The factory price of Hang silk luo spun yarn was about 400 to 500 yuan lower, and the Shanghai market had very few transactions, with asking prices standing firm. Huajin crepe and rayon feather yarn were in demand from the Hankou community, so transactions have been very active in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Stock Market Situation is Still Uncertain - The Phenomenon of Inverted Prices Occurs Between Spot and Deferred Yong Yarn - There is Hope for a Reprieve on the 20% US Bond Security Deposit - Stock Exchange and Broker Joint Petition to Beijing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was still very uncertain, with deferred settlements imminent. Moreover, starting next week, the payment of a 20% security deposit, which must be paid in US dollar bonds, leaves doubt as to whether there is room for accommodation. Retail investors are closing out their positions during the delivery. Some large investors are forcefully buying spot yarn, marking a major shift in operations, and the process has repeatedly risen from low to high. The phenomenon of inverted prices occasionally occurs between spot and deferred Yong yarn. Although people have different observations on the Xinjiang incident, due to the unfavorable environment, those who are pessimistic are more numerous. The morning opened lower, and after opening, deferred Yong yarn advanced from a low price of 5,200 yuan, with numbers 104, 157, and 179 advancing to 5,400 yuan. Numbers 223, 97, 65, 72, and 85 were still sold, retreating to 5,260 yuan. Numbers 103, 19, 177, 60, 106, and 76 advanced to 5,400 yuan. Numbers 84, 102, 97, 185, 235, and 224 were supplied from time to time, dropping to within 5,300 yuan. Numbers 180, 89, 61, 152, 50, 223, and 117 were all acquired. Numbers 157 and 231 forcefully acquired spot Yong yarn, raising the price of deferred Yong yarn to over 5,550 yuan. Numbers 102, 107, 91, 65, and 83 divested, dropping to 5,380 yuan. Numbers 28, 153, 23, 204, and 152 bought in at low prices. There are rumors that there is hope for a reprieve on the 20% US bond security deposit, and representatives of the stock exchange and the brokerage association have a joint petition planned. Buying interest is still strong, and prices rebounded to outside 5,500 yuan. Numbers 16, 29, and 224 divested without end. Numbers 235, 8, 36, 185, and 94, although advancing, were marked high by the Commercial Press from 183 all the way to the limit. However, outside 5,500 yuan could not be sustained for long, and retreated back to within 5,400 yuan before closing. Number 231 forcefully supported spot Yong yarn, and number 104 also absorbed more deferred Yong yarn. The closing price was again stable. Spot Yong yarn closed at 5,420 yuan, and deferred Yong yarn closed at 5,430 yuan. After the close, numbers 148 and 226 sold out, once forcing deferred Yong yarn down to below 5,380 yuan, but retail buyers were still eager, and the final price was shouted up to over 5,430 yuan. The result was that the price for immediate delivery stock Yong yarn was the same. Huafeng, Xinguang, Xinhe, Yonggong, Jingfu, Xinxing, and Wei Cuo were slightly lower. Zhongfa fell by half a percent. The Commercial Press was the only one to rise to the limit. Datong, Jinglun, Wuhe, Lian, and Xinya were slightly lower. Guohuo and Zhongs fell by half a percent. Huochai, Neiyi, Zhongfang, and Rongfeng were slightly higher. Numbered stock immediate delivery Yong yarn Jingfu and Xinguang slightly dropped. Yonggong, Huafeng, and Xinhe fell by half a percent. Off-exchange stocks were still slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Depressed - Foreign Stocks Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public sentiment for public bonds was depressed, and the environment was unfavorable. Unified C opened at 6,500 yuan in the morning, already seeing a decline. Rooms 360 and 230 sold out, and prices declined from 6,800 yuan to 5,800 yuan. Yarn flower merchants and room 503 acquired, and the price lingered around 6,400 yuan. The result was that A, B, and D were all 800 yuan lower than the previous close, and C and E fell by 1,300. Transactions were approximately 5 to 6 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks were still not sustained. Security merchants continued to sell, and Hesheng also divested. Retail buyers could not resist, and public sentiment was still timid due to the current situation. Jardine Textiles opened at 59,000 yuan in the morning, and prices declined to within 55,000 yuan before closing. The result was that Jardine Textiles, Wheelock Marden, and paper all fell by more than half a percent to less than 1 percent. British Industries, Guangyi Brewery, and Aviation were slightly lower, less than half a percent. Steel was the only one that was flat.</p>
<h3>China Textile Construction Collects Cotton in Various Regions - Has Reached 1.4 Million Dan</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] To promote the use of domestic cotton, the China Textile Construction Company has actively established cotton collection points in various cotton-producing areas across the country to carry out purchasing work. It is reported that since the new cotton harvest began around September and October of last year, the company has purchased a total of 1.4 million dan of domestic cotton in Northeast China, Tianjin, Qingdao, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Shashi, Nantong, Jiading, and other regions. Cotton is now approaching the end of the season, so the purchasing period for this year will only last for another month. It is heard that the quality of the cotton collected in Xi'an is the best, followed by Zhengzhou, Hankou, and other places.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit - Market Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Another report: Cotton market prices have recently declined due to slow sales of cotton yarn, with yarn factories becoming less interested in purchasing. Moreover, with the end of June approaching, credit is unusually tight in the market, and prices in the interior have also declined. There were not many transactions in the market today, and the trend was flat and weak. Fellow traders slightly traded midday samples, with 82 pieces of Shashi cotton at 1,475,000 yuan, 100 pieces of Hankou fine velvet at 1.29 million, and Chongtong 50 dan at 1.12 million yuan per dan. The above prices were all warehouse delivery prices. Because the price of Baohua cotton was high, the local yarn factories had no intention of purchasing. Only a small factory in Wuxi transacted 40 pieces at 1.52 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Continuous Distribution of Goods by the Company - The Rising Trend of Cigarettes is Halted</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market initially saw continued demand from local merchants, and the owners held on to their goods, causing the market to rise in a straight line. However, good times did not last, and fellow traders from other ports resold on the market, causing the market to soften. In the afternoon, the rising trend was halted due to the China Company's distribution of Double Axe and Quanlu, the Huaming Company's distribution of "Crusader, Great Million Gold," and the rumors of Huacheng also distributing goods. British Great decreased by 80,000 yuan from the previous day. Old Dao, Wu Hua, and Jiaodi remained strong. The Chinese cigarette market was still strong.</p>
<p>[Another report] Canned cigarettes are in high demand due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival and the need for gifts. Prices are exceptionally firm, with 50 Qialike priced at 50,000 yuan, Three-Five brand at 42,200 yuan, and Small Cannon at 29,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Scheduled to Hold Shareholders' Meeting</h3>
<p>The 23rd annual general meeting of shareholders of the Bank of China is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 14th of this month in the conference hall on the fourth floor of the bank. The board of directors has notified all shareholder representatives to register before the 13th. It is understood that this shareholders' meeting will not only report on business operations and the final accounts, but also discuss the distribution of profits. The bank's current business meeting, which opened on May 5th of this month, has lasted for a week. Group reviews of proposals began on the 6th and have now come to an end. A second general meeting will be held today, and a closing ceremony will be held.</p>
<h3>Evaluation of 35th Year Aged Tea Completed</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Since the China Tea Joint Operating Company decided to purchase the aged tea of the 35th year and began the price evaluation, it is known that the evaluation work has now come to an end. The prices of the various grades of tea that have been evaluated are currently being sent to the tea merchants for their opinions. If there are no objections, the purchase will be carried out according to this evaluation, and then negotiations will be held for export.</p>
<p>Domestic Tea Prices Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday's tea market saw continued purchases of domestic sales tea by local shops and Hakka merchants, causing public sentiment not to be discouraged. It was difficult to see good transactions, but prices were firmer than before. The green tea cores, which were frequently favored by Tianjin, remained quiet due to the inability to resolve the negotiations between the two parties. As for the export of fancy teas, since several local Chinese merchants, in view of the current situation of Chinese tea exports gradually nearing extinction, resumed operations in order to actively promote them, transactions have slightly recovered in recent times, and the market atmosphere has been able to stabilize. It is learned that Wang Yutai Tea House has recently shown interest in purchasing last year's Qimen black tea, and if the price offered is generous, there may be a flurry of activity.</p>
<h3>Cloth Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was showing a firm trend from the beginning. At 10:30, Hankou merchants made advances, and traders also came to acquire, because after the ban on the transportation of yarn and cloth to Hankou was lifted, the price of yarn rose, so public sentiment was unusually excited, and the owners of cotton cloth were even more eager to hoard. Therefore, the price of each grade of fine cloth rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan across the board. The prices of other bleached cloth, twill, serge, gray cloth, Berlin, etc. also rose, ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sales of Bituminous Coal are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Coal Market, shipments of bituminous coal have been distributed in succession, and it is difficult to boost the market, especially as the arrivals of Fengcheng, Tongpo, Letong, and Renxi Tong are abundant, and sales are extremely sluggish. The arrivals of old blocks and coke from Hankou for white coal are also high, and purchase is greatly affected. However, because the water rate for this month has been adjusted, the mine price for Yuanhua fines delivered in Shanghai has increased instead, so most of the white coal blocks are still holding their prices, except for a small number of Hakka merchants who urgently need cash and are willing to sell at a low price.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branches Rebound</h3>
<p>Jinshan branches have recently seen prices rising because the production price is not harmonious, and the merchants mostly hold back, so the market has gradually rebounded, rising by more than 10% before and after. The current lowest exchange rate in the market for Yuan school is 860,000 yuan, only then will they be willing to exchange.</p>
<h3>China Textile Construction Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 498 pieces, all sold to manufacturers. There were a total of 246 purchase applications.</p>
<h3>Impact of Taiwan Dollar Exchange Rate Change on Taiwan Sugar Ration Price Adjustment</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Due to the recent change in the exchange rate of the Taiwan currency, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has requested that the price of Taiwan sugar be adjusted accordingly. The Sugar Subcommittee of the Price Evaluation Committee held a special meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to increase the price of the 19th term sugar ration from Taiwan Sugar Corporation by 16% compared to the previous term. Specifically, special grade cotton white sugar is 460,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Grade 1 cotton white sugar is 420,000 yuan per dan. Special grade granulated white sugar is 450,000 yuan per dan. Grade 2 granulated white sugar is 400,000 yuan per dan. Taiwan brown sugar is 370,000 yuan per dan. In addition, Peruvian sugar is also priced at 524,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sugar Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was sluggish due to weak actual sales and abundant supply. The Guild's initial price for Peruvian granulated sugar was only 558,000 yuan, then rose to 568,000 yuan, and later settled at 565,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 yuan. Taichung Grade 20 granulated white sugar was 485,000 yuan, also down slightly by 5,000 yuan. Grade 3 and a half white sugar initially fell slightly by 10,000 yuan to 515,000 yuan, later rebounding to 520,000 yuan. Grade 24 coarse white sugar decreased by slightly over 10,000 yuan to 575,000 yuan. Local sugar felt even more sluggish, with very few transactions. Shantou green sugar was 325,000 yuan. Shunde high-quality green sugar was 310,000 yuan to 300,500 yuan, with less than 100 packages traded. Xinghua white open sugar ranged from 460,000 to 540,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar was 320,000 to 330,000 yuan, and the second grade was 300,000 yuan, all down slightly by 10,000 yuan, with 400 baskets traded. Although Diaogreen sugar was quoted at the original price, there were few buyers. With the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's ration price adjustment today, there is hope for a rebound in market prices.</p>

<h3>The Red Zone Within China</h3>
<p>— Translated by Diao Songxi</p>
<p>The author is Mary Lumar Knight, an American woman who worked as a correspondent in China for a long time. During the war, she was transferred back to the United States to hold an important position in the Bureau of Censorship. Later, she returned to China to work for a magazine for six months. She has considerable knowledge of China. This article is published in the May issue of the American Reader's Digest.</p>
<p>Now that most of the American troops have withdrawn from China, what will happen to the Chinese Communist Party? What impact will their policies have on the United States and world peace?</p>
<p>First and foremost, it must be clear that the Chinese Communist Party are communists. They are not like many Americans mistakenly believe, similar to members of the American Farm Bureau Federation and harmless to the country. They are staunch fanatics, typical figures of Marxist-Leninist ideals. Their leaders are either controlled by the Russians, trained in the Soviet Union, or both. They believe that the whole world is moving towards communism. Their two million troops (including guerrillas) wear red stars. They have already received some Russian aid, and if given more assistance, they may launch an offensive from the northern sea and, with the cooperation of all "underground work" organizations in the major cities, occupy the weaker areas of China. If China turns red, the entire Asian continent will inevitably become red!</p>
<p>Russian Rule is More Difficult to Endure Than Japanese Rule</p>
<p>When I arrived in the industrial centers of Xunyang and Anshan, the Red Army (Soviet and Chinese) had already withdrawn. It was still hot then. I was knocked down by a National soldier and threatened by a Chinese mob. Although I declared that I was an American and protested, they mistook me for a Russian and ignored me.</p>
<p>Just ask the common people. It is said that the six months under Russian rule were more difficult to endure than several years under Japanese rule. The Japanese, because they wanted to develop the industry in Manchuria, at least gave many people jobs. The Russians were not like that; they set back industrial development by decades. The machinery they transported was equivalent to twice the average annual export of machinery from the United States. Of the nine iron factories in Anshan, six were completely destroyed by them, and the remaining three were destroyed by the Chinese Communist Party!</p>
<p>All the facilities in the major cities of Manchuria were destroyed by the Red Army, so that the million people of Shenyang had no water to bathe in, and there was almost no electricity. After the Chinese Communist Party destroyed the railways, they cut off the starving south from the grain-producing areas of Manchuria, which the Japanese had never done before! They (the CCP) recruited farmers and dug up hundreds of miles of railroad ties, and even cut off the hands of those who drove trains so that they could not drive. This is what the mayor of Anshan told me.</p>
<p>Fearing the CCP More Than Fearing the Russians</p>
<p>He said: "The Chinese people fear the CCP even more than they fear the Russians, because the CCP is more cruel, and even encourages young guerrilla members (boys aged ten to twelve) to murder their own families!"</p>
<p>In Shenyang, a former CCP colonel who had just defected to the National Army told me: "I used to be often ordered to force bandits to go to the countryside to rob, burn, rape, and do everything. After the peasants had suffered enough, the CCP army would pretend to come in and provide relief, and then try to gradually induce the peasants to believe in communism."</p>
<p>The CCP has already trampled on a quarter of China's 500 million people and a quarter of its 11 million square kilometers of land, mostly in northern China and Manchuria. The entire Red Zone has Yan'an as its capital, with a population of 50,000. (At that time, Yan'an had not yet been recovered.) Yan'an was hung with countless red flags printed with axes and sickles, huge photos of Lenin and Stalin, and communist slogans. Most of the curriculum in senior high schools is political and military; most of the students are young men, who are being trained to serve as teachers and guerrilla leaders. Speech is strictly controlled. Children in kindergartens are taught songs of class struggle, so the ideological control of children begins in kindergartens. Leaders only allow newspapers to publish what they want the people to believe. They use leaflets, flags, and speeches to promote propaganda, and the people's spirits are endlessly burdened; there are also "secret agents" watching to prevent any opposing opinions.</p>
<p>Of the 130 million people in the Red Zone, only about 1.5 million are party members, and the number of party members holding public office is less than half of the total number of civil servants. In fact, they occupy all important positions. As for the 13-member Politburo and its 5-member Secretariat, they are all Red Party members. The tunes they are now singing are the same tunes that those who are now Soviet satellite states sang in the past, and now they have become elegies.</p>
<p>The "Far East Bureau" Was Still Active This Spring</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party has long been a member of the Third International and occupies an important position in the Far East Bureau of the Third International. Those who have been engaged in sabotage work in Asia for more than 20 years have all received special training. Their achievements in India, Indochina, and Malaya have apparently been progressing daily.</p>
<p>The leaders in Yan'an claim that they had already broken away from the Third International before 1943, which was when the Third International was ostensibly dissolved. However, documents obtained by the Chinese intelligence agency are sufficient to prove that the Far East Bureau of the Third International was indeed active in early 1947 and affected communist parties all over the world, including the American Communist Party. As for resolving the Chinese civil war, it secretly designed to oppose any conditions other than those proposed by the Communist Party, and also opposed any conditions that the United States tried to resolve.</p>
<p>The CCP still denies any relationship with the Third International or the Russian government. As for the outside world, it is determined to bring the benefits of "new democracy" to China, not to benefit the working class. However, Mao Zedong, the number one CCP member, said in his speech to the party congress in Yan'an in 1935, "We communists never hide our political goals. Our final program is to promote China's entry into communist rule."</p>
<p>The Most Powerful Figure in the Communist Party</p>
<p>Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, is a short and fat, 53-year-old hunchback, with long black hair parted in the middle. He likes to eat melon seeds and red peppers, and talks while eating. His large, round face is radiant because of his bright eyes. He is a great debater and a speaker. He claims that he avoids conflicts with the Russians because he believes that China is China's, but he has two sons being educated in Moscow. In his childhood, he did very hard work under the authoritarian rule of his farming father, which led him to revolt and join the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. He quickly rose to become the leader of a peasant guerrilla. In order to organize the rickshaw pullers' union in Changsha, he even went to work as a rickshaw puller himself. He then became a member of the Red Army Committee and Chairman of the Jiangxi Soviet, and later led the so-called "Long March" fifteen years ago with other personnel. At that time, the Communist Party left central China and moved north to its current residence, which is next door to Russian Siberia. Mao lives with his fourth beautiful movie star wife, Lan Ping, in a simple cave dwelling, which is a propaganda tactic that has created the Mao myth, equal to the Stalin myth. His photos can be seen everywhere. The songs taught in kindergartens are to praise Comrade Mao. Today, he is the most powerful figure in the Chinese Communist Party and one of the most powerful figures in the Far East. There is no doubt that the key people around him are controlled by Russian forces.</p>
<p>Head of Propaganda, One of the Five Giants</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai is the most gentle Asian I have ever met. He is the head of foreign propaganda. He comes from an official family, is handsome and always smiling, is neatly dressed in a Western suit, and is polite—such is his background, but he became an organizer of workers in Shanghai and Nanjing and has planned two riots. Today, he has become a member of the Politburo and one of its five giants. As for claiming that the Chinese Communist Party is not communist, that is also Zhou's doing.</p>
<p>Deng Yingchao, Mrs. Zhou, who made Zhou believe in communism, told me very frankly: "If the US government continues to support the Kuomintang, the Communist Party will have no choice but to seek help from a certain country and comrades around the world." Zhou said that he had no contact with Russia, but Mrs. Zhou inadvertently mentioned that she and Zhou lived in Moscow for six months in 1939-40.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong—the first giant of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai—the head of Communist Party propaganda.</p>
<p>Zhu De—the number one figure in the Communist Army.</p>
<p>The Liaoning Arsenal Demolished by the Soviet Army (Photo by Zhang Wenjie)</p>
<p>Zhu De's Troops Plunder as Much as Possible</p>
<p>General Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Red Army, owes his position to the strict training he received in Moscow. In 1928, he merged his forces with Mao Zedong and jointly established China's first Soviet government.</p>
<p>Zhu De has recruited one or two million male and female guerrillas. A tall and thin farmer's rifle detachment leader, Ms. Kang Keqing, once asked him how to use a captured machine gun, and as a result, he married her. The Red Army lacked firearms, so they had to plunder them from others. The surrender of Japan brought them a good opportunity to obtain the Japanese army's stores. Zhu De ordered his troops to plunder as much as possible. The CCP competed with the National Army in all the occupied areas, starting a war that has not stopped to this day.</p>
<p>A former CCP colonel told me: "Russia did not openly support the Chinese Communist Party in Manchuria, but the Russians repeatedly told me the secret locations of the artillery they had obtained from Japan, asking us to use them to attack the National Army."</p>
<p>Once Anti-Mao, Li Lisan Reconciled</p>
<p>Li Lisan is a thin and lanky agitator who was already a prominent leader fifteen years ago. Regarding his escape at that time, it is said that he led a secret organization against Mao with Russia's tacit approval and was discovered, so he had to escape.</p>
<p>Li Lisan—Political Head of the Northeast Communist Army.</p>
<p>Li was completely a figure from Moscow. He fled to Insk, married a Russian wife, and went to the Far East University to teach a group of brokers who were returning to their old homes in Asia. Just like Tito brought "new democracy" back to Yugoslavia as a prerequisite for entering communism, he is the liaison between Yan'an and the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Just before the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, orders arrived in Yan'an to prepare for Li's official reinstatement and reconciliation with Mao. Li changed his name and took an American plane to the red capital—Yan'an. After the official reconciliation was completed, he accompanied Marshal Malinovsky, who commanded the "Russian" army composed of Mongols, Buryats, and other 175 ethnic groups belonging to the Soviet Union, from Siberia into Manchuria.</p>
<p>Americans as Pigs, Northeast Communist Propaganda</p>
<p>The power of the Chinese Communist Party is developing westward to the area with a large number of simple farmers, who are easily controlled by the CCP. Those farmers listen to what the Communist Party says—all landlords are enemies of the public, and the land should be divided among the farmers. The Communist Party often sets up a people's court to handle cases accusing landlords, asking the audience to raise their hands to make a judgment, then reads out the landlord's crimes, and then divides his land, sometimes using land bonds as his compensation, and sometimes not at all.</p>
<p>Newspapers and radios tell the farmers—if they continue to listen—the benefits of the new democratic land policy. Under the conditions of this propaganda, the peasant soldiers only do what the leaders tell them to do and have proven themselves to be adept at guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have both accused each other of violating their agreements, but an American general—not Marshall—told me: Ninety percent of all the difficulties in the ceasefire conditions were caused by Communist actions. In my two conversations with the current Secretary of State, he made it clear that he hoped to understand both sides. However, after Zhou Enlai abandoned the negotiations, he attacked Marshall and accused President Truman of instigating the civil war and trying to turn China into a colony of the United States. Zhou Enlai's propaganda became increasingly fierce. He broadcast Yan'an's conclusion that "The only difference between Japanese imperialism and US imperialism is that US imperialism is stronger, and its methods of aggression appear to be more civilized and legal." Therefore, the Communist Party in the Northeast teaches schoolchildren to draw Americans as two pigs on leaflets, kicking them out of China with their feet.</p>
<p>How will the crisis in Asia end? Is the question mark hanging over China peace or war? Only time will tell! Or the Communist Party leaders—can tell you!</p>
<h3>Optimistic Prospects for the Tin Industry in Southern Yunnan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xu Jilian, Kunming, 3rd by airmail</p>
<p>Engineer Ni Tongcai told reporters: The tin mines on the islands of Southeast Asia have been affected by the war and have not yet fully recovered. Once they recover their original production and sales situation, the old tin industry will not be able to compete with it in its current state. At this moment, it is necessary to reduce costs, expand capital, increase production, and use machinery as much as possible. In fact, these are all interrelated. In the final analysis, it still lies in capital. Therefore, tin loans have a huge decisive effect on the future of Gejiu tin.</p>
<p>In the past, the government stipulated control measures for the production and sales of Gejiu tin. After large tin was smelted, it was handed over to the government to receive the stipulated price. This was of course a shackle for the tin merchants. When the control policy was abolished, it was replaced by the method of exchanging gold for tin. Each ton of tin was exchanged for 32 taels of gold, but the cost of insurance and transportation had to be deducted, so that the manufacturers actually got 18 taels per ton of large tin. After much struggle, it was increased to 23 taels of gold, but the difference was too great, so the "gold difference" problem occurred again.</p>
<p>The entanglements that occurred in the past have been delayed. Fortunately, the method of free transportation and sales has been announced, which is a shot in the arm for tin merchants, because manufacturers' large tin can be directly transported to Shanghai and Hong Kong for sale, or they can apply for export financing from the Fu-Hu Bank. There are not as many restrictions as in the past. At the same time, tin prices are rising steadily, which is a new encouragement for tin merchants. The tin merchants, who have gone through hardships, are rubbing their hands again, ready to make a big splash.</p>
<p>Lack of Water Sources in Mining Areas, Need to Establish Power Plants</p>
<p>The next problem is the water source. The Gejiu mining area is the most water-scarce place. The mined sand (waste) often has to wait for the rainy season to come before the work of washing can begin. If the Xiaolongtan Hydropower Plant can really be established and use electricity to pump water from the Datun Honghe River, then the production of Gejiu tin can solve a major problem.</p>
<p>Indeed, when the reporter passed through the mining area, he personally saw that dry scene. Even a bit of yellow mud water on the side of the mountain was treasured and used. Drinking water was taken from here, washing faces, washing feet, and even washing clothes also depended on this. The people in the mining area have never wasted a drop of water!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the Gejiu tin industry is on the road to revival. It has already shown a bright prospect. According to the estimates of private manufacturers: it is expected to produce 3,000 tons of tin this year, plus the output of the government owned tin industry company, which can reach more than 4,200 tons. If each ton is valued at 25 million yuan, the total value will reach more than 100 billion. The export of large tin to earn foreign exchange, calculated at the current exchange rate, 4,200 tons of large tin can be exchanged for 8.75 million US dollars. More optimistically: if the government can quickly and continuously provide large amounts of loans, so that mine owners can fully use their funds, solve the problems of water, coal, and wood, and improve mining technology, it is certified that it can produce 40,000 tons per year, then it can earn 100 million US dollars in foreign exchange. This is such an imperceptible and considerable number!</p>
<p>The Perseverance of Miners is Solid, and the Future is Promising</p>
<p>The torch of victory warmed the hearts of every miner and rekindled hope, but they are still facing many difficulties. However, their perseverance is admirable. To revive such a huge undertaking, of course, requires a spirit of hard work. This time, the reporter went deep into the mining area and contacted many mine owners. They are all willing to dedicate themselves to this promising undertaking, but they also need help from all parties to solve some of the difficulties, because with perseverance alone, many material limitations cannot be solved easily.</p>
<p>I saw those many solid faces, which filled me with optimistic beliefs about the future of the Gejiu tin industry.</p>

<h3>Methods of Social Research</h3>
<p>— Lu Gu</p>
<p>Author: Webb couple (English) Translator: Qian Yishi, Zhan Zhezun Publisher: Commercial Press</p>
<p>The Webbs were among the founders of the Fabian Society in England, and are experienced socialists. This book is the culmination of their research into the experience of British weaving trade unionism, consumer cooperation, and local autonomy. The translators also highly recommend it as a work of substantial content. After reading it, I am convinced that the translators' recommendation is not wrong.</p>
<p>Sociology as a field has only developed in the past fifty years. Not only are there few universities in China with sociology departments, but their history is also very short. Even fewer people have succeeded in specializing in sociology, and most of them translate works from America and Europe, focusing mainly on sociological theory. Sociology is a flat science, its primary purpose being to study the relationships between people. Whether it is pure or applied sociology, it must involve in-depth social observation and infiltration into various strata to conduct various empirical studies, which is the true meaning of studying sociology. The immaturity of sociology in our country means that this type of instrumental specialized treatise is rarely seen. This is not to say that people deliberately ignore its importance, but because unless a country's social work is more developed, it is impossible for a few scholars to concoct some research methods out of thin air. Therefore, the value of this book is self-evident. Although the subject of this book is the general system of British society, the technical or mental preparation and cultivation for how to start researching society itself are the same in all countries. Moreover, we can learn from the research situation of other countries and achieve twice the result with half the effort. This book can fully provide these examples, which is beneficial for beginners, and even specialized researchers need to refer to it.</p>
<p>Instrumentality is like the antennae of an insect, with its own special function. This is the minimum requirement for social workers. This book tells us how to equip and use these tools skillfully and confidently, and avoid the most common mistakes in common sense, such as the general impressions when observing the evolution of facts, which are usually the easiest to ignore, thinking that they are not important. In fact, this is a huge mistake, like only seeing a person's skeleton without realizing the person's appearance. How absurd and ridiculous is this! Because of this, we can only obtain a string of dead concepts, and finally can only be used as ornaments in museums, completely losing the connotation of society. Therefore, observing the activities of social institutions is like exploring the chemical composition of blood, and we must understand the movement of blood in the veins. Most valuable is that he has devoted two chapters to explain the scope of sociology and its inevitable limitations. He first pointed out that sociology must be related to humanity, and that sociology only involves the relationships between people, that is, the observation of countless combinations and the formation of groups and the various related research. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize that the subject matter of sociology is only those relationships that have a certain or universally compulsory nature, so all existing social institutions. What a simple and powerful explanation. The general public's vague understanding of sociology and disregard for its value are mostly due to the lack of this sound psychological foundation. However, modern people still inevitably underestimate the special position of sociology in the scientific community with a doubtful attitude. Undoubtedly, this is the biggest reason for the slow progress of sociology. To eliminate the general public's misunderstanding of the meaning and application of science, I think that not only should sociology itself make such a defense, but also other non-material sciences. Weber knew this, so he did not hesitate to repeatedly elaborate on it, which can be seen in his chapter on "The Relationship Between Science and the Purpose of Life." Interestingly, the current social phenomenon in our country is full of martyrdom, corruption, embezzlement, and using public office for personal gain. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, whether it was the central government or local officials in England, it was also in this state. However, after all, it adopted some cautious and scientific social inventions and greatly cleared it up. This is tantamount to giving our country a good encouragement and imitation. That is to say, sociology will make a huge contribution to reversing China's strange status quo. At least this is by no means a nonsense. Advanced countries have already achieved good results. The task of sociology now seems to begin with how to deeply cultivate people's belief in sociology.</p>
<p>This book is divided into twelve chapters. The arrangement of the chapters has a continuous ladder, and it will be difficult to cross over if a section is missing. The author has put a lot of thought into this, including (1) the limitation of the scope of sociology, (2) the mental preparation of social researchers, (3) how to study social facts, (4) the technique of note-taking, (5) written language, (6) oral language, (7) the British Royal Commission and subcommittees, (8) observing the activities of social institutions, (9) the application of statistics, (10) verification, (11) publication, (12) the relationship between science and the purpose of life. Looking at the whole book, the focus is on chapters (2), (8), (10), and (11).</p>
<p>Regarding the mental preparation of social researchers, the so-called mental preparation is the ideal mental state of social researchers when they begin to explore social organizations. Generally, anything that can be called scientific has its own special mental preparation, and sociology is no exception, and it is especially important. Weber said it well: "We observe things through our vision, rather than using our vision." This is somewhat different from the research attitude of material science. Of course, the research of material science is very objective, and the inevitability of prejudice in non-material science is also true. It is generally believed that when some people are "selfless people," it is just the meaning of the consistency of prejudices between the two parties. Therefore, in order to ensure the accuracy of social research, the objective research of facts and other necessary conditions such as the necessity of sympathetic understanding, the cultivation of general technical ability, and the breadth of general knowledge, we can talk about how to study social facts. In studying social facts, the author also revealed a very valuable secret: "The subject of research should be the whole or part of a certain special social institution, not a problem that one thinks must be solved." This chapter describes the paper-based question-and-answer method that is commonly used. Zhang Bo once failed because of this, which is a very valuable reference material.</p>
<p>Regarding the observation of the activities of social institutions, he gave a large number of examples, which should include the application of various techniques such as note-taking, oral language, written language, and statistics. Written language is divided into documents and literature. He gave a rather broad definition of literature, that is, all works other than the time-sensitive documents of government or local agencies are literature, which is very suitable in sociology, and he repeatedly mentioned that documents and statistics must rely on the corroboration of oral language and contemporary literature.</p>
<p>Regarding verification and publication, these are the last two steps of all sciences, but it is rare to include publication as a topic in works on scientific methods. Sociology is just like other sciences, especially because the facts of the social institutions they obtain, whether due to simple or complex observations, are not very reliable. Therefore, only the probability of facts can be discovered by comparing the two qualities and conducting detailed tests separately. In other words, sociologists use various independent and systematic assumptions at the current stage, and the results obtained are only limited to the meaning of inclination. Since sociology is in the field of knowledge today, when the determination of each hypothesis requires such difficult and complicated unbiased and systematic verification, and because the subject matter is not easy for others to affirmatively accept their conclusions, any progressive discoveries must be published immediately. Weber said that this is "the special task of social researchers, and only in this way can sociology obtain the kind of definite status enjoyed by the sciences of its predecessors." In the "Verification" chapter, Weber also mentioned incidentally that the verification work under capitalism is wasteful and monopolized, which can be said to give people a good warning.</p>
<p>This book is entirely a gain or loss of results obtained from work experience, and I think its value lies in this. As for the fluency of the translation of this book, I believe that there is no need to experience the hardship of "repeated deliberation," so I believe that introducing this book is not a waste of effort.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Middle School Students" (Monthly published by Kaiming Bookstore)</h3>
<p>— Gao Ning</p>
<p>The vast number of middle school students are often troubled by not being able to find extracurricular reading materials. This phenomenon is vividly existing.</p>
<p>After reading the "Middle School Students" magazine for a long time, I deeply feel that there are solutions to the above-mentioned troubles of middle school students in the publishing industry, but they have not looked for them. This "Middle School Students" is a publication that is worth reading.</p>
<p>This "Middle School Students" is a comprehensive publication, which includes education current affairs, social sciences, composition guidance, natural sciences, literature and art, reader's corner, and news summaries.</p>
<p>Taking the recently published issue 187 (May issue) as an example, it has such excellent content:</p>
<p>In terms of current affairs, it has an article "The Moscow Conference in the Past Month," which details the significance of this conference and its nature, which can be understood by young students.</p>
<p>In terms of natural science, there are "The Variation of Sunspots" and "The Thermal Emission of Electrons," both of which are works that enrich young students' scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>In each issue, Mr. Chen Yuan also introduces a country. This issue is about the changing East - Vietnam. After reading these articles, we can have a very clear understanding of the situation of small countries.</p>
<p>It also introduces the figures of the times in the world in each issue. This issue introduces: Motor King Ford and Ho Chi Minh, President of the Republic of Vietnam. If you don't know the life experiences of these figures, you can learn about them after reading them, which is very important.</p>
<p>In terms of literature and art, it has a play "Patriot" and the essays of middle school students.</p>
<p>The news summary of one month is very helpful for middle school students to read newspapers. For example, in this issue, it tells readers in this way:</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang of China - the National Army stationed in Yan'an - on the protection of human rights - the Moscow Conference is exchanging different opinions - two documents on China - the Pan-Asian Conference in New Delhi.</p>
<p>These are all important news in a month. After middle school students prove it, they can know the important news in the previous month. Therefore, they can get a lot of help when reading the news in this month.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this is indeed an ideal extracurricular reading material for young middle school students.</p>
<p>In the past few issues, I can especially recommend the works of special series, such as "Middle School Students and Politics" (with the opinions of Cao Fu, Sun Qimeng, Zhou Yutong, Zhang Zhirang, Wu Yaozong, Shen Yizhen, Chen Qingshi, etc.), such as "Middle School Students and Literature and Art" (with the opinions of Xiao Qian, Lu Shuxiang, Jian Kejia, Jin Lin, Li Guangtian, Pingbo, Shiyi, Ke Ling, Cao Bohan, Liao Yi, Zhu Ziqing, etc.). These major issues are of interest to every middle school student.</p>
<h3>New Treatise on Chinese Personnel Issues</h3>
<p>— Huang Weilian</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in our country, everything is waiting to be done, and there are thousands of things in the country that need to be sorted out urgently. As long as there are suitable people who come forward to shoulder the heavy responsibility and plan everything, the construction industry can gradually recover, and the major national affairs can be on the right track. Regarding the administration of personnel in our country, there have always been two factions: rule by man and rule by law. The rule-by-man faction advocates rule by man, with people as the center of administration; the rule-by-law faction advocates rule by law, with administration paying attention to systems and laws; but no matter what, it cannot get rid of "people." If good laws are supplemented by appropriate people, then good laws can be implemented. It is even more important to enable everyone to be in the right position and do their best.</p>
<p>In recent years, the domestic publishing industry has been quite concerned about personnel administration. A large number of personnel administration books have been published, such as How to Manage Personnel by Qing Ru (Commercial Press, 1933 edition), Xue Bokang's Outline of Personnel Administration (Zhengzhong, 1947 Shanghai edition), Zhang Jinjian's Personnel Administration (Commercial Press edition), and Outline of Personnel Administration Systems of Various Countries (Zhengzhong, 1946 Shanghai edition), Tu Zheyin's Implementation of Personnel Management (World, 1946 edition), Zhao Zongyu's Management of People (World, 1946 edition), in addition, there are He Lucheng's Personnel Assessment (Commercial Press, 1946 Shanghai edition), Zhang Zhenduo's Personnel Engineering (Commercial Press, 1946 Shanghai edition), Huang Yanpei's Experience in Agency Management (Commercial Press, 1946 second edition), Xiao Xiaorong's Personnel Psychological Problems (Commercial Press, 1945 Shanghai edition), etc., but most of them introduce the British and American civil service systems or industrial and commercial management systems, and rarely express specific opinions on the actual problems of our country.</p>
<p>Huang Jingbai's "New Treatise on Chinese Personnel Issues" can be said to be a book that studies the actual problems of personnel and administrative science. In addition to economic problems, the most urgent task for China today is indeed personnel problems. Mr. Gan Naikang said in the preface to this book: "In this rapidly changing trend, what changes will our country's personnel administration cause, and what other problems will be involved? This is also what those who study personnel administration should pay attention to. In this era of democratic centralism and national defense first, the comparison of national strength between countries originally includes the comparison of human resources. From the perspective of the government, the scope of personnel administration should not only be limited to government officials or industrial and commercial employees. The personnel of state-owned and public-owned enterprises have a broad and comprehensive scope, which is the entire plan for mobilizing national human resources, and there must be a reasonable distribution and use of all people.</p>
<p>The Chinese personnel issues discussed in this book include the characteristics of Chinese personnel issues, the talent issues for nation-building, the examination issues at the current stage, the performance evaluation issues during extraordinary periods, the implementation issues of civil service careerization, the issues of organizing job categories, the issues of establishing personnel administration systems, and the issues of improving personnel institutions. How will all these methods be implemented and how will they be started? This is what those who study personnel administration should pay attention to. The whole book analyzes the principles of things, provides methods, and has deep research, and the argument is precise and accurate. It is truly an important book for those who are engaged in studying the current personnel administration problems in China.</p>
<p>Recently, the administrative authorities in our country have attached great importance to improving organizations, controlling finances, and improving office methods, etc., but they often neglect the administration of personnel. In fact, the administration of personnel is more important than all other issues. The promotion of administration depends on people. If we only seek to improve office methods and ignore personnel issues, then we will abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, and it will be difficult to achieve results. In the past, in the imperial examination era, those with excellent learning became officials. Today, personnel assessment is gradually being valued, and it has been tried out in various places, but the various problems of selecting talents and making the best use of their talents are not discussed, which seems contradictory.</p>
<p>Indeed, the biggest problem in China at present is still the problem of using people, and economic problems are still secondary. With suitable talents, we will use economic facilities. In other words, economic problems are ultimately passive, and the active mechanism is ultimately people. The problem of people is very big. There are people above and people below. If we want the entire organization to cooperate from top to bottom, those who are leaders above must not only be able to plan comprehensively and lead the masses, but also have the ability to move people with virtue and be tolerant of others. Those who serve others below must have a true spirit of service, adapt to the environment, and show loyalty and cooperation. The main spirit of the so-called personnel system is still to select people for the job, distinguish between ability and inability, so that the virtuous and capable can make the best use of their strengths and perform their duties, so that there will be no perfunctory behavior or passing off inferior goods as the real thing.</p>
<p>What is most regrettable is that there are people who cannot strictly abide by their duties or cooperate with others in terms of duties, but they are meticulous in terms of rights and cannot tolerate the slightest difference, making things difficult for those above. They do not know that rights and obligations go hand in hand. If they say rights, they must have duties. There must be obligations first, and then rights. And if they serve others, they must put others before themselves, so how can they not be loyal to those who seek for them? I have never heard of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most important task of the future personnel system should be to seek talents. In addition to using the examination method, there should be a board of precise investigation for various talents, so that the examination and appointment agency can be the general assembly of talents for promotion and can play the role of selecting people for the job. In addition, people above and below can do their best in their respective abilities and duties, and can understand each other everywhere, and there is absolutely no selfishness, then the Chinese personnel problem can be easily solved.</p>
<h3>A Guide to Learning Foreign Languages</h3>
<p>— Juan Zhi</p>
<p>Written by Chen Yuan, published by Shixue Bookstore</p>
<p>Foreign languages are weapons in our life struggles. As every person in the new era, it is essential to master these weapons.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, every young person now must learn one or several foreign languages. In school education, there used to be at least one compulsory foreign language course. As for the benefits of learning a foreign language, everyone knows it. It will give you a lot of help in academics and literature and art—for example, those who study philosophy can understand many original works, and those who love literature and art can read the original texts, which is really both progressive and enriching.</p>
<p>However, what we see is that some students and young people often do not pay much attention to learning foreign languages, and some only read the textbooks in school several times and do things perfunctorily. Some even have a distorted understanding of learning foreign languages. They think that learning foreign languages is another means of "doing business," such as learning English in order to become compradors. We have seen many of these phenomena. Precisely because of this, we must bring it up to correct these colorful erroneous phenomena and embark on a truly research-oriented and struggle-oriented learning path!</p>
<p>Chen Yuan's work is a book that provides some learning methods for those who are learning foreign languages.</p>
<p>The content of this book is generally worth reading, except for a few small sections. The content is based on some of the author's own experiences, so it can also be said to be a discussion of learning experiences. The content of this book:</p>
<p>First, the author is writing about the question of "to learn or not to learn?" The conclusion is very simple, that is, "foreign languages should be learned," but it should also be "appropriately flexible." The author's reason is this: If you want to learn, it is: "If you have interest, tools, and time, or you can always squeeze out a little time, then even in a mobile life, you may as well start your learning."</p>
<p>Second, in terms of learning principles, the "Five Dosm" - "eyes, ears, mouth, heart, and hands," are indeed the most important in learning, and the author also emphasizes these five dosm. This is necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, "reciting the dictionary" - the author points out that this is not appropriate. Using more, using the basics, attacking the strong, reading magazines, intensive reading, and translation, can be said to be very beneficial instructions for learners.</p>
<p>Third, it talks about various languages - modern aspects: Esperanto, French, English, German, Russian, Japanese; ancient languages are also briefly mentioned, Latin and Hebrew.</p>
<p>In this regard, the author points out that in the modern language aspect, almost every one is not easy, which of course has a reason. In the ancient language aspect, the author advises those who learn foreign languages to understand the ancient languages best, because most of the European languages originate from this, so understanding the ancient languages makes it easy to learn modern languages. I deeply agree with this and hope that all foreign language lovers can do this.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the steps for learning a foreign language must know its: - essence - origin - development - structure. If you understand this, learning is very easy, so ancient literature is very justified to learn it.</p>
<p>Fourth, the author puts forward the learning method chapter, which points out: 1. Pronunciation, 2. Vocabulary, 3. Grammar, 4. Idioms, 5. Conversation, 6. Translation, 7. Writing, 8. Application, 9. Verse, 10. Ending.</p>
<p>The methods told to scholars here can indeed be a good reference for learners.</p>
<p>Finally, a list of learning books is opened. Some of these books are very referenceable, and some books are incorrect. It is also hoped that the author will revise them well in the next edition.</p>
<p>We know that in learning, "there is no smooth road to walk, only those who climb up without fear of difficulties have the hope of reaching the shining peak." This is a famous saying, and it is correct.</p>
<p>This book is not a learning shortcut, but a good guide to learning. We must remember the above famous saying, and then read this book, which is very beneficial.</p>
<h3>News from the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>John Steinbeck's novel "The Moon Is Down," which describes the situation in Norway during the occupation, has been translated into Chinese by Zhao Jiayi and published by Chenguang Publishing Company.</p>
<p>The sixth issue of the third volume of the monthly magazine "Maternal and Child Health" has been published. It is networked by people from Dade Hospital.</p>
<h3>"Two Generations"</h3>
<p>— Jian Ci</p>
<p>Shen Ji, Rixin Literary Righteous Book</p>
<p>Before discussing this brilliant collection of short stories, "Two Generations," let us first recall the literary situation in Shanghai during the occupation. This is absolutely necessary and not entirely without significance.</p>
<p>To speak of "freedom of speech" and "freedom of publication" in the occupied territories was naturally unimaginable. If one were to write a literary work that inspired thoughts of resistance against Japan or anti-Nazism, the inevitable consequences would be arrest, torture, or even death. Therefore, the path of literature during this period was extraordinarily difficult and tortuous. Some focused purely on the love affairs of intellectual young men and women, striving for exquisite technique and story structure, becoming the temporarily popular "Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies" school. Others emphasized the expression of human warmth, with meticulous depictions of minor events and small details. Still others boldly used human sexuality as a rallying cry. And there was also the vogue for detective stories, chivalrous thieves, romantic tales, and obscenity... In short, all the dregs of literature, with the aim of diversion and anesthetization, rose up with this political tide, filling the urban landscape of the occupied territories, before the people whose reason and emotions had been numbed.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, it is undeniable that literature full of vigor and a spirit of struggle also sprouted in this intolerable climate, shouldering the responsibility that this distressed era placed on every conscientious literary worker. Like a giant torch, radiating fire and heat, in this dark and hopeless era, from "The Horse Thief," "Ghost," "The Wildness of the Great Marsh"... In this series of short stories, this unrestrained author, with the greatest burst of emotional fire, shot far into the hearts of the people who yearned for liberation and light, fostering a burning, almost insane emotion, causing the "explosion" of the feelings of the weakened people who had already been numbed, and completing the most rational love and hate of the rebellious mind.</p>
<p>The author of "Two Generations" has a gloomy name, Shen Ji. This book, completed in a dark and obscure time, contains ten short and concise novels. In terms of writing method, he still uses his extremely intense emotions, placing them in moods of absolute wildness, desolation, terror, and melancholy... In excitement, he completes the embodiment of his emotions and reason – the narration of the stories – and elevates them, burning them to the highest saturation point. At the end of the story, the author habitually teaches to break through this saturation point, so that the reader's emotions also break through and explode at the same time, but completes the author's purpose, broadens the emotions of the receiver, and as a result, also fiercely and savagely confronts love and hate. And in terms of technique, it is clear that the author has made more perfect progress, whether in the honing of words, the exploration of characters, or the depiction of emotional environments.</p>
<p>Faced with such a complete work of art, we should be optimistic about the author's future.</p>
<p>And on the very first page of this book, the author wrote this famous saying: "Have you ever seen scorpions? In order to cross a body of water, the ones at the front drown themselves in the water, so that the ones behind can crawl over their corpses."</p>
<p>With the text matching the author's great spirit, I think: history will prove that "Two Generations" is a collection of brilliant light on new literature.</p>

<h3>Random Musings on Alone Docking</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Yu's control of the floods had both successes and failures. The reason seems too simple; middle school children can write it clearly on their exam papers. Yu's failure was not without merit, because he told later generations with facts that building dikes to prevent flooding is not a good method.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate water; it is the fate of all living things. When it is placed in a teacup, it seems very calm, but when it trickles into the sea, it forms an incredibly enormous power. And the so-called surging ocean is precisely the accumulation of trickles.</p>
<p>As for wanting to build a waterproof dike in the sea to build a dream kingdom, it is both impossible and unnecessary to even think about it.</p>
<p>No matter how delicious the food is, first you must have an appetite, and second you must be able to swallow it.</p>
<p>Friendly countries have sent us many canned goods, and the kindness is naturally appreciated. Canned foods piled up like mountains can often be seen on the streets, and the price is also quite low, but sales are not good. The reason for this is quite thought-provoking for those who care about people's livelihood and society.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Weinan said: "It's far better to send some stinky tofu." This is not a laughable statement.</p>
<p>Because the appetites of our vast people are not for biscuits, nor for butter.</p>
<p>To praise us too much will cause us to go from being flattered to having seizures.</p>
<p>Therefore, for all well-intentioned gifts, please consider the appetites of ordinary people; then we can swallow them.</p>
<p>Most of the four hundred million compatriots in the motherland are poor; the fortune of going abroad and living in foreign houses ultimately belongs to a very small number of people.</p>
<p>I hope that the compassion of others will not cause unfortunate consequences.</p>
<h3>Rambling on News Translation</h3>
<p>— Yan Anfu</p>
<p>Translation is really not an easy thing, and translating news, especially about international politics, military affairs, economics, culture, education, and other news, is even more difficult. First, people engaged in translation work must have a full understanding of foreign languages, and then translate them into fluent and smooth national languages. This is the most basic condition. In addition to this language skill, they must also have a considerable understanding of international current affairs. At the same time, after translating into the national language, it must be understandable to the people of the country, so that it can be regarded as fulfilling the responsibility of translation. What is discussed here is the translation of news, especially from English into Chinese.</p>
<p>Translating according to the literal meaning of the English original into rigid Chinese, making people confused or easily causing misunderstandings, is unacceptable. I remember that more than a month ago, in a Chinese telegram issued by a news agency in this city, there was a translated passage called "Soviet Minister of Armed Forces." The term "Minister of Armed Forces" is really inappropriate. Presumably, the English original of this term may be Minister of Armed Forces. The term "Minister of Armed Forces" not only makes people feel unfamiliar, but also easily causes misunderstandings, because the words "armed forces" often make people associate with words such as "war," "aggression," and "expansion." A good military and political minister, if translated in this way, wouldn't he become "Hitler the Second"?</p>
<p>When translating the names of foreign government departments or institutions into Chinese, one should first understand the political system of that country. In English, the prime minister is called Premier, the premier of the State Council is also called Premier, and even the president of the Executive Yuan of our government is called Premier. However, when translating into Chinese, one must pay close attention and distinguish them clearly. If the word "prime minister" refers to the premier of the State Council in a country with a republican system, it is tantamount to making the same joke as calling the president an emperor. The US State Department (State Department, which is actually about the same as the foreign ministries of other countries, but with a larger scope. It can be said that it is harmless to translate it as the State Department. But since it is translated as the State Department, why not translate Secretary of State as the Minister of the State Department? Why did you come up with a "Secretary of State"? I don't know which translator "created its meaning." Just imagine that in a democratic republic like the United States, how can there still be the existence of "Secretary"? But later, everyone made mistakes and went along with them, and the Minister of the State Department has always been called the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I also thought of the translation of the name of the former Secretary of State (please forgive me for following suit). The former US Secretary of State was Byrnes (should be Byrnes, with the emphasis on the word "Byrnes"). I don't know who translated the surname as Bernas. Later, everyone made mistakes and went along with them as usual. Once I heard a Chinese reporter and an American officer discussing current affairs in Tunxi. The reporter spoke English well, but when he talked about "Bernas," the American officer didn't understand who he was talking about. Later, the reporter wrote the word Byrnes on white paper with a pencil, and then he understood that he was talking about Byrnes.</p>
<p>Recently, various Chinese newspapers in this city published news about the case of the beating to death of Zang Da's second son, including "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately received a letter from the US Consulate, which was based on the US military court's statement: "The Chinese court's request is of great interest to this military court..." The words "of great interest" here seem to be worth considering. The English original of these words must be the word Interested. In my opinion, it should be translated as "attention" or "concern" here, and should not be translated as "interest." For a case involving human life, it seems a bit awkward to use words such as "feeling interested," and the meaning is completely different; for example, you say to a friend: "I am very concerned (or very attentive) about the news that your father has passed away." If you change it to say: "I am very interested in the news that your father has passed away." Isn't that a joke?</p>
<p>The above rambling is scattered, unsystematic, nothing more than nitpicking, talking and laughing.</p>
<h3>Urban Planning Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Ning Xuren</p>
<p>Many people came to visit the Civil Engineering and Architectural Urban Planning Exhibition sponsored by the Engineering College of St. John's University, and its content was very rich; there was a plan for the new Hongqiao, and they divided Hongqiao into several units, with schools, entertainment venues, and hospitals in the units; the residences included apartment-style and lane-style, all with detailed drawings or models; the design of the residences was very thoughtful, in addition to economic principles, it was also necessary to consider the adjustment of sunlight and air, and the wind direction, etc., the construction of workers' residences should be simple and economical. The remaining are the various stations designed by Professor Bauer; the work of student courses includes drawings and models, and the models include steel-concrete houses, iron bridges, airports, suspension bridges, and sluices.</p>
<p>After eight years of war in China, more than half of the buildings in various places were destroyed. After the victory, it is extremely necessary to restore them. Due to the lack of talent, economy, and materials, the pre-war state has not yet been restored. The Shanghai Municipal Government has established an Urban Planning Committee and has begun to plan the new Greater Shanghai, providing them with the "St. John's University" plan for reference. To build Shanghai into an international city, all kinds of houses, factories, entertainment venues, etc. must undergo rigorous design in order to be comparable to major European and American cities.</p>
<h3>A Stroll on Central Lin Sen Road</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago, when I lived on Xuehuali Road in Shanghai, I often took a walk along Xiafei Road every afternoon, starting from the French Park on Hualong Road and walking all the way to the intersection of the Cercle Sportif Francais on Ya'erpei Road. This section of the street was very clean, and I often met friends. At that time, Sun Fuxi lived in a garden villa on Huanlong Road, and his home seemed to be the headquarters.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War this time, most of my friends were scattered. I returned to Shanghai for more than a year, and people who returned from various places reunited in the area of ​​Central Lin Sen Road in Shanghai. I still often take a walk on this section of the road, but it is a bit longer than in the past. The east end goes to the intersection of Madang Road, because I often go to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and the west end extends to Xiangyang North Road, or even to the intersection of Fukaissen Road. The China Association for Cultural Cooperation is there. There is the Yunlin Painting and Calligraphy Society and the Huangshan Art Garden on Luban Road. Near Lin Sen Park, there is the Xiangling Pavilion and the Wenyi Cafe. Li Shizeng lives on Pushi Road, Sun Fuxi now lives near the South Shaanxi Road on Huanlong Road, Ba Jin lives in Lingfei Fang, Ouyang Yuqian lives on Central Lin Sen Road, the intersection of South Shaanxi Road, Bi Xushao lives on Changle Road, and Wang Yaying still lives in the original Xuehua Fang, so entering the alleys is not only not lonely, but also feels more prosperous than more than ten years ago!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Gymnasium has a part of the rooms for the Shanghai Literary Writers Association and the Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office; the general assembly of the Writers Association, which moved to Shanghai from Chongqing, has its headquarters on Kangti Road, which is much farther away; but the Writers' Bookstore is next door. Wang Jinshan and Liu Pingli, Liu Shi are both near Fuxing Park, and L莽 often goes to the Journalism College. The above friends mostly gather in the Xiangling Pavilion tea house every Saturday afternoon. Although Xu Zhongnian lives on Haifang Road, when he returns to Shanghai, he must run around on this section of the road.</p>
<p>There are many friends on North Sichuan Road, but the road is too far, and I rarely run there. Even things about cultural activities are mostly concentrated in the area of ​​Central Lin Sen Road. In the past, the French Park was the center of the walk, but now Lin Sen Park is the center. It is a pity that the Liming Academy of Lu Buru has been discontinued, otherwise there will be more hustle and bustle in the park.</p>
<h3>Higashikuni Opens a Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Ye Lin</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, Higashikuni, the first prime minister of Japan after the surrender, is going to open a small restaurant in the black market area near Tokyo Station. It is said that there will be a tea room attached, serving light tea and coffee. If it opens, Hirota, Suma, Nagano and other disciples of Mitsuru Toyama will surely become honored guests. And make the tea room a Club for "rectifying comrades."</p>
<p>The word "Miya" in Higashikuni Palace has been cancelled with the deprivation of the nobility title. The reporter's strokes outline that he is no longer an unattainable figure, because now no matter who goes to see him, there is no need to put on a morning dress, wear a top hat and white gloves. He is now a commoner. Because he is a commoner, Higashikuni wants to open a restaurant, because he has lost his "fief." If opening a restaurant is not just a hypocritical decoration, but a way to make a living, then it is naturally a blessing for the Japanese people. From this, we can see that their civil rights have no existence of aristocratic privilege, and will not make them suffer another oppression and exploitation.</p>
<p>In Japan, 1945 was an important watershed era in history. The main key to this watershed is that the emperor and the royal family must have restored their human identity. Higashikuni is precisely from noble to commoner, only to this day. He and his peers are only rectified, not settled. In their personal words, this is a kind of luck. In historical terms, we can hardly know the consequences. It is said that Higashikuni said: "I will pay attention to the reconstruction work of Japan. I want to share the hardships and joys." And I am happy to obtain the identity of a commoner. If this is not self-deprecation, we are willing to tell Higashikuni "Miya" that what he will get must be hardship, and we are also willing to tell Higashikuni that what he will get must be joy, even if he is unwilling to share it, history will not allow him to escape.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time, such as the former Higashikuni Palace and the current Higashikuni, etc., opening a restaurant is what we want to hear, and we are willing to congratulate him.</p>
<h3>The Sadness of Children</h3>
<p>— Shi Xinghuo</p>
<p>Today, in the weekly diary of a third-grade elementary school student, I read such a passage,</p>
<p>"Yesterday, when I came home from school, I saw an airplane in the sky, fighting a battle there. I thought: "If World War III starts, our lives will definitely not be safe!"</p>
<p>How simple and profound this passage is!</p>
<p>The author of this weekly diary is a very naughty child of twelve or thirteen years old, and can be regarded as an outstanding "noisy person" in the class. Who knew that the shadow was also deeply engraved in his chest - what a terrible shadow!</p>
<p>Carefully savoring that short passage, it doesn't seem like a child's tone at all. It is simply full of adult sadness, and that sadness is so heavy that it makes people immediately infected with an indescribable melancholy.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because he has heard it too many times from the mouths of his elders; it was only when the teacher asked him to do a weekly diary that he involuntarily wrote that passage, which shows that these words have at least been filtered through the child's mind, and he can't find the slightest shadow of innocence and optimism. This is such a terrible thing!</p>
<p>In fact, children like this of twelve or thirteen years old have completely grown up in the flames of war. They have indelible impressions of disasters and famines. Especially the high prices make it impossible for them to get the minimum nutrition and conservation they should have. The black hand of life has strangled the throats of the young, making them have to think: "If World War III starts, our lives will definitely not be safe."</p>
<p>This kind of precocious and unhealthy thinking is reflecting the sadness of the current children. When can we liberate our next generation from this shadow?</p>
<p>Here we can't help but cry out: "Save our young ones"!</p>
<h3>Art Scene</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Provincial Compilation and Translation Center has recently been abolished. The writer Li Helin recently wrote to a friend in Shanghai saying: he will soon leave Taiwan and go to Guangxi to work.</p>
<p>The literary translator Li Liewen first worked in the new open community in Taiwan, and recently served in the education field. It is said that he will soon leave Taiwan and go to Fujian.</p>
<p>"Far Wind" Monthly will be edited by Li Baifeng from the next issue.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Feifei, is it sour?"</p>
<p>She nodded, then closed her eyes again, but her hands were always holding the copper rabbit she was playing with.</p>
<p>"Okay, then don't eat it!" Lao Zhu reluctantly said in a gentle tone like a woman: "When the train stops later, Uncle Zhu will go and ask for water for Feifei to drink."</p>
<p>Feifei didn't say anything, as if she also wanted to try her best to fall asleep.</p>
<p>He didn't dare to deduct the remaining quarter of the pear, and still carefully clamped it with two fingers, letting it hover under his palm, for fear that Feifei would want to eat it again in a while.</p>
<p>More than thirty minutes passed, and Feifei seemed to have fallen asleep for a while. Suddenly, she jumped straight up from Lao Zhu's arms, opened her eyes wide, and shouted while crying: "Mom, Feifei wants you! Feifei wants you!" Zhu Zhaonian was so flustered that he couldn't help but put his arms around her and gently shake her.</p>
<p>"Feifei, listen! Don't be afraid! Uncle is here!" He said a few words in a row, and Feifei, who woke up from her dream, gradually calmed down, but Lao Zhu tried her temperature, and it was much higher than just now.</p>
<p>"Feifei, does your head hurt?" he asked gently.</p>
<p>"It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!" Feifei pointed her right finger at her head and cried crisply.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian immediately felt that the temperature in the carriage seemed to have increased by ten degrees, and beads of sweat broke out on his forehead and body.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, Feifei, you calm down, it will be fine in a while!" He could only tentatively comfort her with words. "When the train arrives at the next stop, Uncle Zhu will immediately get you some water to drink, and buy you two yellow and round little buns. Feifei, you say, do you love to eat little buns?"</p>
<p>Only then did a faint smile appear on Feifei's small face, which had suddenly lost half its weight in the past few days.</p>
