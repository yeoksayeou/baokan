<h3>今晨發表離華聲明　魏特使團飛日轉韓　報告書將分事實與建議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕美大使館公布，魏德邁將軍使團，定廿四日上午九時半離京飛日，結束其一月在華之勾留。一行將經東京至漢城，對韓國南部作一短期考察。另據魏使新聞顧問華生談：魏使廿三日鎭日未離寓所，亦未接見任何賓客，除專心處理公務外，僅與司徒大使及其顧問羣等有所接觸，並料理什物，準備廿四日之行。本週內以酬酢會談較繁，資料之最後整理及分類工作，未如預期完成，所有資料使團均將携行，後到者亦將轉寄漢城，繼續加以硏討。魏氏此行之最後工作報吿，將於返抵華盛頓時，即行提交杜魯門總統，其內容約分事實及建議兩大端，俾助杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿之參考與選擇。使團於廿四日晨將發表其最後一次公報，以爲臨別聲明。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕記者廿三日傍晚赴美大使館內魏使團之辦公室，總幹事赫金斯中校，政治顧問斯普魯斯，新聞顧問華生等方收拾打字機及文件等。據發言人華生於答記者所詢外傳魏氏將返華出任駐華大使一說之眞相時稱：余無所悉，惟深知魏氏戎馬半生，今後仍望担任軍職，故將此行結果報吿杜魯門總統後，當願遄返麥爾蘭州之福特米迪，即魏氏所率第二軍司令部之所在也。又使團另新增秘書上士二員，藉，以協助該團紛忙之資料整理工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿三日電〕魏德邁特使定飛東京前，將有機密文件三箱，重逾五百磅，在武裝保護下裝進專機。使團人員聲稱：該項機密文件包括報吿，統計及備忘錄等，特使當據以起草正式報吿，遞呈杜魯門總統，俾便決定美國未來對華政策。叧有各方文件約一噸，經特使審核並節略後，已予銷燬。使團今日深夜繼續工作，整理最後一批函電。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿三日電〕中國高級官方消息稱：蔣主席曾要求魏德邁將軍出任其軍事顧問，但魏氏答稱：渠不能接受此一職位。而魏德邁之發言人華生，對此一消息旣不證實，亦不予否認，僅曰「余不知也」。按魏德邁在一九四四年繼史迪成爾出任駐華美軍總司令，並與蔣主席交誼極深，故此一消息並不驚人。其後特使團一正式發言人被邀批評此報道，乃稱：「此類事誠有之，中國政府曾數度建議以不同之職務，畀予美國顧間」。然特使團現下不能陳述是否最後將建議顧問方面，物貿方面或其他方面之協助，故對此類建議不能批評，蓋此項建議與吾人向杜魯門總統報告中之建議略有關係也。</p>
<h3>富貴與勞苦子弟　應同樣肩荷重任　參預穩定政治與經濟之奮鬥　魏德邁忠告我國學生</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿三日電〕一羣中國學生籲請魏德邁將軍助其赴美國求學，魏德邁答稱：在此「危急之秋」，學生應留在中國參預爲要政治與經濟穩定之鬥爭。</p>
<p>美大使館廿三日發表魏德邁答覆一羣中國戰時翻譯員之信件稱：「中國學生甚至若干敎授，頗不欲負担其作公民之重大責任，實爲最大之不幸」。</p>
<p>魏德邁指稱：在戰時政府予學生軍以特別之待遇，實爲「不公平與非民主」者，渠謂：「富貴子弟應與窮苦子弟並肩作戰，同樣受苦，受敎育者與未受敎育者，既同樣分享勝利之果實，是亦應同樣担荷戰爭之責任」。</p>
<p>「每一壯年男女熱心而無私地爲祖國效勞」，爲其神聖與不可逃避之責任。</p>
<p>「在最近結束之戰事中，受苦最深，貢獻最大者，實爲中國之勞苦大衆，在軍隊中經受苦難與危險者，多爲不識字之人民，事實上彼等頗有不知爲何作戰者」</p>
<p>「農人子弟爲小國軍隊之主幹，反之，學生軍乃均受政府之特別優待，薪給較豐，配備較優，糧食較多，以及其他之特別關注，余以爲此實不公平且顯爲非民主者」。</p>
<p>「余會接獲許多學生與智識份子之信件與口頭抗議，均抱怨敎育之停頓，而謂政府應增撥經費辦學，余敢率直陳言，如此則政一府對以收穫及其子弟獻給軍隊之窮苦農民應作如何揹置耶？」</p>
<p>「余建議汝等，可否鄭重考慮上述之思想，而與友伴互相討論。」余斷言因汝等在戰事中所表顯之愛國心，必能使汝等同意，每一中國人，不論富貴或貧賤，不論曾受敎育與否，對祖國均有確定不移之責任，如欲眞正之快樂，眞正之團結，以及持久民主之實現，則此種責任，必須平等分担」。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕魏德邁廿二日曾吿國府諸委員及部長稱：共產黨在中國，不純係軍事問題，亦是改進人民水準問題之一。</p>
<p>魏氏又稱：官與人民及軍隊與人民間之關係，應予以改進，豪富者之子，軍官之子，政府大員之子，亦應根據新征丁計劃予以徵抽。據悉：魏民曾申言，渠乃以中國之友發表上項談話，並非以特使身份談話。</p>
<h3>展期舉行大選　理由殊不充分</h3>
<p>選總某高級職員談</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕選舉總事務所某高級職員談，我國二千一百徐縣中，僅二百至三百個縣目前不能辦理選舉，外傳有二十二省無法進行選政之說，殊不確實。東北九省有三省以上可辦選舉，其他省份亦僅熱·魯，察·綏·冀·豫·晋之一部份無法推行選政，軍事若好轉，可辦選舉之地區等猶可增加。以上係就區域而言，此外蒙·藏、僑胞。邊疆·職業。婦女選等舉，絕不致有何問題，故若干人士所提展期舉行大選，理由殊不充分。</p>
<h3>墨西哥新大使　艾吉蘭今抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕外部息：墨西哥新任駐華大使艾吉蘭將軍，定廿四日晨抵京，外部禮賓司長凌其翰，帮辦王季徵及墨西哥大使館秘書卡利羅，均將赴下關車站迎候。大使定廿五日拜會王外長，呈遞國書日期待定。</p>
<h3>國防部令所屬　官兵不得缺額</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕據軍聞社訊，國防部以部隊員兵數額係按編制補充，不得有缺額，浮報情事，頃特令各級部隊長，亟應切實考察，加强戰鬥力量，並注重新兵保育，打破官兵界限，改善士兵伙食，灌輸政治常識，充實憐樂及治療設備，促進士兵健康，養成良好素質，並飭監察易隨時派員實地考察。</p>
<h3>蘇聯不守信約　美總統極不滿　蘇報抨擊魏德邁使團</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿三日廣播：美國會議員沙巴士昨與杜得門總統長談，檢討國際形勢，據稱：美總統對於蘇聯之不守信約，極爲不滿。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿三日廣播：蘇聯海軍機關報「紅色艦隊」今日刋稱：美方將以廿億美元貸與中國政府，並配備廿個師之中國軍隊。該報猛烈抨擊魏德邁特使團，認爲該團已使中國國民黨與美政府之聯繫，更趨密切。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三三日電〕對美再度抗談蘇聯續佔大連事，我外部廿三日持沉默態度，日前司使訪王外長，是否談及此事亦無從證實，唯據權威方面透露，當局對此事之注意一如以往，再次申明我方立塲或採取適當步驟之時機，當在不遠。</p>
<h3>節約實施辦法　大部草擬完成</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕節約消費綱要實施辦法，經各有關機關分別草擬，大部告成，社會部所擬辦法，廿三日送政院，經濟部所擬之獎用國貨辦法等下週一亦可望送出。社部草擬之實施辦法共有下列七種：（一）厲行守時運動實施辦法（對工作，開會，宴會，應接，交通，娛樂等時間咸有規定）。（二）厲行以工代賑實施辦法，（三）設立習藝所實施辦法，（四）提倡廢止年節餽贈實施辦法，（五）慶弔紀念物品節約實施辦法，（六）筵席節約消費實施辦法（對普通應酬，招待外賓等咸有規定），（七）公務機關及國營事業機關限制宴會招待實施辦法。</p>
<h3>禁舞實施辦法　明可送呈政院</h3>
<p>內容顧及實際情形</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕節約辦法綱要所規定之禁止營業性舞廳，其實施辦法正由內部草擬中，下週一可望向政院提出。據草擬此一辦法之內部禮俗司負責人談：「本司草擬此一辦法，除重視法律應用及範圍外，亦顧及社會實情，因之對地方政府之意見殊爲重視。報傳上海市府曾與本部交換意見，並有意見書供本部參考，無法證實；但上海旣有衆多之舞廳及賴跳舞爲生者、本部草擬辦法時自當注意及之。至如何者爲「營業性舞廳」及禁舞之步驟如何等，當參酌各方意見」。記者復詢以報載上海各舞廳將用抽籤方式分批禁絕，是否確實，渠謂禁舞自當按步實施。</p>
<h3>四聯工商貸款　貫辦與否未定　若干有力人士主停貸</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕四聯總處決定緊縮貸款後，各方面對此一決定內幕，揣測不一。茲據參加經濟決策之某高級人員語記者：緊縮貸款之決定殆爲一大轉變前之預兆，蓋目前政府內部對此一政策，迄未能有最後決定，一部有力人士，以爲該款之目的，專在增加生產，穩定物價，惟事實上以現代生產條件中貨幣之重要性不能超過原料動力及技術，故如原料來源不暢，動力技術不加改進，則貸款之結果，廠家不惟不能用以增產，且多有用以投機圖利，結果反增加游資，刺激物價，故不若停止貸款爲佳，而一般人士則以爲過去貸款政策之實施，雖未能全部達成預期目的，然數年來多歟廠家猶能賴以維持，若一旦停止貸款，若干賴貸款維特之大規模廠家，勢必因而停辦，結果一方面增加失業人數，他方面將减少生產，故貸款仍應繼續，現雙方爭執未決，惟前項意見似佔優勢，而最近四聯總處審愼貸款之決定，實爲受該項意見影響之結果。</p>
<h3>外匯結匯銀　平指定十二家</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕國行平分行頃奉令確定本市十二家外匯結匯指定銀行，計：中國·交通。中信局。郵匯局·浙江興業。上海·金城·中國實業·聚興誠·中法工商·東方匯理·麥加利（尙未復業），而花旗不對外營業，匯豐聞係在富初申請時條件不合，皆未在內。</p>
<h3>我與港府協定　內容極為廣泛</h3>
<p>公布日期因故延緩</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕我與香港政府商談業經數月之經濟金融協定，其內容包括至爲廣泛，如緝私，徵稅，匯兌與取締黑市等等。本月十五日已由我方中央銀行代表邵曾華與香港財務司長羅斯在港簽字。此項協定全文，中央銀行總裁張嘉璈，日昨到京業已携呈政府。我與香港政府本定二十三日雙方同時公布，頃據關係方面息，自英政府本月廿日午夜宣布實行經濟新措施暫停英鎊承兌美元後，此項協定內之匯率以及數項關連問題，尙待解決，故公布日期，勢須稽延。</p>
<h3>南昌糧價下瀉</h3>

<h3>港督夫婦將訪穗</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港廿三日電〕港新聞處公布，港督葛量洪爵士伉儷，定廿七日訪穗。</p>
<h3>記者身份問題　短期內可決定</h3>
<p>谷正綱答復首都報界</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕首都新聞記者公會理事劉啓瑞，許君武，鄧季惺等三人，於今下午代表該會赴社會部陳述關於確定記者身份問題之意見，當由谷部長正綱親自接見。劉等表示，新聞記者地位本極崇高，且在自由職業中，對於指導社會惟進民治，有直接之影響。當茲普選在邇，應請政府從速確定記者身份，藉杜濫冒而免糾紛，且爲民主政治樹一楷模。谷部長當答覆，對於確定記者身份問題，社會部認爲極屬迫切需要。在職業團體選舉事務所方面，業已注意，現正與內政部交換意見中，當可於最短期內有所決定，不致有負新聞界期望。劉等認爲滿意，旋即辭出，因時間關係，定廿五日續赴內政部表示意見，並促記者法之速即實施。</p>
<h3>民社黨革新派　重要人事決定</h3>

<h3>平津冀軍政督導團　今日在平正式成立　李團長稱已接不少密告函</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕平津冀軍紀吏治督導團籌備竣事，定廿四日晨開首次團務會議，正式成立。北平行轅參加該團之團員爲副主任吳奇偉，保定綏署爲副主任馬法五及平津冀三臨參會議長顧鍾秀，時子周，劉瑤章。團長李嗣聰今接見記者稱：「本團之成立，乃奉主席令，目的在從整飭軍紀澄清吏治着手，而加强總動員力量。職務雖與監察使類同，而權限較大，只要査有犯罪實據，即可不經報吿，而先予依法懲辦，已接獲不少密告函」。</p>
<h3>金鈔及庫券整套辦法　當局正考慮改訂　張嘉璈否認黃金國有說</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕財長兪鴻鈞廿三日談稱：黃金問題正由全經會研討中，美金庫券處理問題，則由財部研究中。對改革幣制事，渠揲絕評論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕繼外匯管制辦法改訂後，政府爲求配合該項辦法之實施，正考慮擬定上，將來或將參照美國黑市，使美元與黄金間先規定一定比率，然後再照此項比率，根據國內每日外匯市價，核定每日黃金之法幣市價，惟此項辦法其性質非即等於完全開放黃金市塲，因今後黃金交易仍須限定於人民與國家銀行，或其指定之銀行問也。（二）美金庫券決停止發售，准已售部分之如何償還問題，則有關方面尙有爭執，一派人士主張依照外匯市價償還，以維政府　信，另派人士則以為，若照市價償還，國家損失過鉅，不若於償還時附帶捨弃　較厚利息。（三）出口物除資源委會易貨償債之未完部份及春蠶貸款之決定收購部份外，其餘停止收購，並停止一切補貼。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿三日電〕央行總裁張嘉璈，廿三日單獨接見本社記者，聲明中國政府並無將黄金收歸國有，或强迫人民依照公開市價將黄金售與政府之意，日來關於此事之傳說，均屬無稽之談。張氏並透露，當局正就與短期美金庫券有關之問題從事研究，深信不久必能獲得滿意的解決辦法。張氏於談及投機商人於政府頒布新外匯條例後抬高出口商品價格之事時，暗云政府可能採取行動以予制止，但張氏旋又出示中國主要出口商品之價格表，顯示自外匯新條例頒佈以來，各項價格僅有些微增加。渠認中國得以繼續轍入急需之糧食及燃料，以穩定人民之生活，而無損中國工業復興工作之進展。張氏謂：限制出入中國境界之旅客携帶美金至多一百元，系以國際海關規則為據而決定。</p>
<h3>美在遠東貿易重心　東京可能代替上海　美實業家將在日大量投資</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿三日電〕日恢復對外貿易後，新近抵日之美若千實業家，曾受命特別考察以東京作其公司遠東貿易重心之可能性。彼等曾單獨吿中央社記者謂，原擬以上海作其公司在遠東貿易重心之希望，殆已幻滅。澳門·東京·香港可望起而代爲彼等遠東貿易之主要港口，並謂因香港政府對貿易管制之日見增强，香港之重要性，亦日漸消失。彼等曾特別指出澳門雖爲華南沿海聲名狼籍之賭窟，但以爲我國輸入外貨之後門，故地位突形重要。彼等續稱，日本投降不久，彼等之公司，曾運貨一批至上海，其後半年來即未續運貨至我國。彼等認爲東京爲遠東「可能之淸理站」，在東京或日本其他城市以美國資本製造之成品，可廉價供應遠東市塲，然彼等現尙不敢確定日本被佔領後之情勢，究允許此項計劃之實現否。但於任何情形下，此或已確定不移，即若千美國公司之視綫，已逐漸由上海移至東京，視其爲遠東貿易中心，乃準備於日本大量投資。</p>
<p>日商工相宣稱　三年後可出超</p>
<p>〔又電〕日商工相水谷長三郞。昨答覆參議院商務委員會之問題稱，三年後日本貿易即可出超，但此有賴於商工省所訂今後三年每年產煤一千五百萬噸之計劃，是否可以實現。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港廿三日電〕根據港出入“署發表之數字，進口貨物除美貨穩居首席外，日貨在港市塲已漸趨活躍。去月美貨入口値二八五六萬八千餘元，轍美貨物四八九萬九千餘元，本年七個月來美貨輸入一億六九五二萬元，同期輸出八〇二八萬七千餘元，入超達入千九百餘萬。去月由日輸入爲五〇六萬八千元，七個月以來，由日輸入八八四六萬五千餘元，入超七百七十餘萬元。</p>

<p>日貨走私問題　尙無完善對策</p>
<p>吳蘊初對記者談稱</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於赴日商務代表團工業界代表之產生，據吳蘊初表示已分函各地工協分會徵求意見並請將選出之代表之名單寄滬，預計兩週之內，代表可全體產生。吳氏本人則表示不習商務，不願赴日，並謂工商界代表數度晋京之結果，已使政府尊重民意，几國內及台灣能出產之商品，均不擬自日本輸入。反之，日本原料之於我有用者，如人造絲。硫黄。紫銅等，均在輸入之列。日本之機器零件，對於我國接收之工廠有用，自應准其入口。日貨之走私爲將來之大問題，但迄今尙未有完善對策。美國人士認爲日本今日亦爲高工資之國家，故日貨之競爭不足畏，實則與中國相較，日本工資低廉遠甚。據上海紡織界之消息，我國之紡織工人工資竟八倍於日本工人，實無法競爭。</p>

<h3>與魏德邁特使道別</h3>
<p>魏德邁將軍奉杜魯門總統之命，率領事實調査團，前來中國，實地考察我國政治經濟及軍事實際情形，業已竣事，並定於今晨離華，飛往東京。按魏德邁將軍係於七月廿二日午後五時，自關島飛抵我國首都，立卽開始其調査工作，冒暑奔波，不辭辛勞，曾親至平·瀋·靑·滬·台灣·廣州等地「尋求事實」，並與各界人士會晤，博訪周諮，迄今剛滿一月，却又踏上征途，飛往韓國。我們對於這位「中國之友」的離去，不能不表示惜別之意。魏德巡將軍所提出的忠吿諍言，尤共値得我國朝野的反省與自惕。</p>
<p>魏德邁將軍離華返國之後，必將其考察中國政情所得，擬就報吿書呈交杜魯門總統，作爲美國採取新的對華政策的張本：其內容如何，目下自無法獲悉，我們且亦不欲隨意揣測。惟魏將軍離華的前夕，曾出席主席它邸座談會，向我中區衛局率直批評我國的現勢，據各方報道，歸納起來，大意如下：中國之一切，向極可爲，但惜無一事能獲得預期之後果，其癥結乃在「人謀不臧」，人力未盡。（一）政治方面：政府對於羅致人才，增進行政效率，雖已獲有若干進步，但仍嫌不够；希望政府能接受各方而自由批評，肅淸貪官汚吏，並禁止公務員經營商業。（二）經濟方面：中國資源豐富，財產充足，但惜尙未開發，以致貨棄於地，財藏於「己」；中國在美私人資產，總數頗鉅，若能好自爲之，妥善運用，卽足以促進中國經濟之發展。（三）軍事方面：軍人待遇太低，必須儘速改善，使官兵同甘共苦，爲節省軍費計，尤應採取精兵主義。（四）共匪問題：政府不能認共匪問題純屬軍事問題，除軍事以外，並需要政治力量，改善人民生活，實爲當務之亟。</p>
<p>上述各端，的確是値得我國朝野反躬自省的。魏將軍率直坦白的誠懇態度，尤足爲我們所稱道。中國人民對於交友之道，向來抱着「以誠待人」的哲學觀念，而「言忠信」尤爲立誠之始，所謂「修辭立其誠」者就是，我們除了虛心接受魏將軍的好意而外，也願提出若干稍有出入的觀威，以供魏將軍與一般美國盟友的參考。</p>
<p>第一，魏德邁特使在華一月，僕僕風塵，由京滬而華北，由華北而東北，其後又由京泥而台灣，而華南，席不暇暖，熱忱殊可感佩。但我們不知魏特使在各地究竟訪求了幾多可信的事實，而不盡同於道聽途說？昨天各報披露了上海各界若干人士聯名向魏特使所提出的備忘錄，不禁令我們想到魏特使三次來滬，而何以竟未與上海地方法團及工商敎育社團負責人士謀取會晤，交換意見，以言虛心客覜，調査週詳之道，未免有若干遺憾罷。何况側聞魏特使所接見的人士，大率由其左右預先部署，祗須與政府意見不同的人，無論其社會地位如何，物望如何，以及意見之有無價値，就有優先晤談的便利，果爾，則深恐其「耳食」之談，將，不但無裨於中美邦交，亦且無補於世界大局。</p>
<p>第二，魏德邁特使的勸吿中國政府自動革新，在原則上我們完全同感，我們認爲中國不論在政治經濟以及軍事上，都需要改革，不改革恐將無以自拔。但是我們也相信，中國在八年抗戰之後，創鉅痛深，有如大病方愈，祗能徐圖復元，欲言徹底而劇烈的改革，勢非急切所可辦。中國已有四五千年的歷史，人民的傳統觀念，與社會的習尙，也不容許中國立卽全盤改革。中美兩國民族的性格，並不盡同，美國人觀察中國的政情，有時未免太主觀了一些。美國國內有一部分人，不能深切了解中國的政治，其原因也就在此。所以我們希望魏特使考察中國政情，應該特別重視中國文化的特質，與中國正在演變的階段，萬不可祗以美國的尺度來權衡中國目前的政治。</p>
<p>第三，我們要中美兩國朝野特別重視兩國親善的歷史。中美邦交基礎的奠定，可以說在庚子八國聯軍之後，當時「瓜分」之說，甚囂塵上，中國局勢危如纍卵，幸賴美國國務卿海的翰於一九零二年發表聲明，提出門戶開放政策，始能打破勢力範圍，轉危爲安；中國人民從此認識美國對華並無領土侵略的野心。迨「九一八」事變，史汀生之不承認主義，加深了一層中美的睦誼。這次大戰，中美邦交又經一番血的洗鍊，成爲患難朋友，而美故總統羅斯福氏在亞羅會議的偉大成就，尤使我們永遠不忘。我們認爲中美邦交的密切，有其發展的久遠歷史，決非任何物質的代價可以換得的。凡是中美兩國人人民，應該特別珍惜，特別愛護，切不可彼此間因若干商業上的一時利害打算，而任其减損此不平凡的友誼。但是最不幸的，在中國有一小部份人士，千方百計，企圖離間中美的深交，以爲他國縱橫裨闔留一餘地。我們喚起魏德邁特使和美國盟友的注意，爲世界大局計，爲遠束和平計，千萬不可上這個大當！</p>
<p>第四，我們還要指出，在美國國內，也有少數人，主張扶持日本，想把日本當作將來遠東的安定力。這種見解，不僅在理論上，與戰時美國將中國視爲遠東安定力者背道而馳，而且在實際上，也是此路不通的。在二十世紀之初，英國何嘗不與日本同盟，而日本所報施於英國者何如？在抗戰之前，中國何嘗不願與日本做朋友，日本所報施於中國者又何如？日本今後能有信義嗎？還在未可知之數。日本口言親善，而意存侵略其實，終於導成第二次世界大戰。這一個歷史的敎訓，最値得美國當局的注意。日本人的表面恭順，是否卽爲日本人民對於美國的心誠悅服？「君子可欺以其方」。魏特使今晨飛赴東京，不知其將作何感想。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要重言聲明：中國人民極願與美國始終保持友好關係的，而美國之是否實際援華，倒是値得美國自己去考慮，中國人民並不關心及此，因爲我們深知「自力更生」之道的。凡在不損害中國主權及國格的前提之下，魏德邁特使提出任何建議，或美國提出任何勸吿，均爲我們所歡迎；反之，中國人民決不願見政府爲了求得美國的援助而自損其主權，自毀其國格的。這就是中國的作風，也是中國人的骨氣。</p>

<h3>傳土擬派兵赴希　協助政府軍戡亂　土軍官一批將赴美受訓</h3>
<p>〔中央社安加拉廿二日電〕希臘方面否認曾請土耳其出兵赴希協助打擊叛亂份子，但此間消息靈通人士透露土耳其現正硏究是否及在何種方式下派兵赴希。另據南斯拉夫通訊社訊：美共和黨參議員羅區及英駐中軍軍總司金兒羅克爾之訪問雅典，即在硏究土耳其出兵希臘之可能性。</p>
<p>〔合衆社安加拉廿二日電〕據此間獲悉：土國軍官將赴美受製練，第一批四十人在本月底乘飛機離土飛美，按此項決定，乃由於最近美土討論之結果。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科廿二日電〕蘇聯「工作報」評論土耳其與美國之關係辦：甚至土方報界，均以爲此種關係並非奴役之鐵鍊，但終有一日土國將以鮮血償還此債。土耳其國土中凡足以影響中東之戰略地，均經美國部隊建築軍港與機塲。美國幷使土耳其維特龐大軍隊，其中一部已專供希臘鎭壓遊擊隊之用。土國經濟大部已受美國之統制，面農民貧困不堪，其農產均無銷路。</p>

<h3>泛美防務會議　美阿意見對立</h3>
<p>〔聯台社巴西彼特洛波里期廿三日電〕阿根廷今日在泛美聯防會議中，堅持西半球對付外來侵略行動，應經美洲各國一致通過，而反對美國主張之三分二多數表決制。預料該國提案在下星期以前，不致交付討論。至其反對使用武力對付美洲內部侵略一節，已由特委會從影審査。美國與其他各國則贊成任何一國如遇侵略，不問來自西半球內外，均應憑藉武力處理。</p>
<h3>巴基斯坦　應為聯合國當然會員　阿根廷向秘書處提出議案</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿二日電〕阿根廷已於今日向聯合國秘書處提出將要求承認巴基斯坦爲聯合國當然會員國之案，列入下屆聯合國全體大會之補充議程，其照會指出「整個印度旣爲簽訂一九四二年一月一日宣言之聯合國創立國，而巴基斯坦及印度聯邦乃分裂此一整個印度之結果，是毋需以新會員之地位聲請加人，因此聯合國全體大會應宣布印度度邦及巴基斯坦均爲聯合國之當然會員。據阿國大使表示，渠對聯合國機構之將印度國旗更爲印度聯邦國旗而不使巴基斯坦國旗增加聯合國國旗之陣容，深爲反對。渠將在聯大政治委員會中提出阿根廷之意見。</p>

<h3>安理會討論英埃糾紛案　埃反對直接談判　旁聽席上發生一塲紛擾</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿二日電〕安理會議塲中，今日由聯合國衛隊兩度制止埃及旁聽人員之擾亂。先有一　髯載紅色土耳其　之靑年，被衛兵二人拽出室外。繼有一埃及人在旁聽席中起立高呼，「非自由即爲國際和平死亡，安理會死亡」，「打倒帝國主義」，「尼羅河流域萬歲」等口號，此人亦由衛隊簇擁出室。</p>
<p>〔路透社電〕秩序恢復後，埃總理諾克拉茜起立發言，堅決反對巴西所提建議英埃恢復直接談判之決議案，並堅決表示埃政府決心保護蘇丹不使分離。渠並聲　若安理會採用巴西之決議案，不足以消除現存對於和平的威脅，而埃及恐不得不再向安理會提出申訴。諾克拉茜對於中國代表蔣廷黻所提之修正案，即在巴西決議案內增加，査得英政府業已部份撤退其駐埃軍隊，並準備談判全部撤退」等字樣，表示歡迎。並曰，巴西決議案中未曾特別提及英國治理蘇丹之結束，渠指中蘇丹之土地完被，業已遭受威脅，因此渠必須重申埃政府具有保護蘇丹不使分解，並使蘇丹人民得在與埃及統一之機構下，自理事務之決心。諾氏最後並聲明埃政府認爲巴西之決議案，其意在規避安理會應行負担之首要責任。</p>
<h3>澳正式請求聯大　檢討否決權制度</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿二日電〕反對安全理事會中强國得行使否決權制度最力之澳大利亞，業於今日正式請求在下屆聯合國全體大會之補充議程內列入「再度檢討上屆全體大會就否決權間題所成立決議案」之案。澳洲並要求全體大會，審査上屆大會決議案內所具之建議案，已被執行至如何程度。預料小國抨擊否決權制度，將爲九月十六日起下屆聯合國全體大會中之緊張場面。阿根廷認爲不一致投票法即否決權應予取消，並要求以一特別委員會討論如何更改此種規定。</p>
<h3>聯合國機構決定　續干涉印荷爭端　但對干涉方式各方意見仍懸殊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿三日電〕聯合國似乎已決定繼續干涉印荷之糾紛，雖則對干涉之方式尙意見懸殊，然一般均同黨安理會能在星期一或星期二決定干涉之方式，祗少須組織安理會十一國之觀察團，調査遵從聯合國停戰令之程度。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿三日電〕蘇代表葛羅米柯今日在安理會中批評中國及澳洲所提令駐在吧城之領事向安理會報吿印尼現狀之建議。渠認安理會不能信賴駐吧城五國領事中，英法美三國領事之意見及行動，蓋英法美關於印尼問題所取之立場，均有利於荷蘭，而中澳就此所提之共同建議，實有規避聯合國機構之嫌。安理會如欲處理此一問題，務須設立兩委會，一以監督最近之停戰令，一以執行仲裁，或設立具有前兩項職權之一個委員會亦可。安理會必須迅速行動，而此兩個或個委會須由安理會理事國組成，其委員人數成可少於十一席，但必須爲安理會之理事國代表。其先葛羅米柯並拒絕美代表詹森一可提之決議案，該案建議由安理會向爭端當事人提出斡旋建議，以協助和平解決爭端，為執行此項協助任務起見，安理會當設立三人委會，其中兩委員由爭端當事人就安理會理事中選任，其餘一委員，由前兩選任之委員再就安理會理事中選任之。荷代表克里芬斯列席發言，警吿安理會，謂安理會所能及所已爲者，均有利於極端份子，渠重申荷蘭不認安理會有處理此一「並不威脅國際和平之內部事件」之權。</p>

<p>〔路透社日內瓦廿二日電〕中國代表團團長金問泗今日在此間國際貿易會議中討論國際貿易憲章草案之際政辭，表示目前已應就該憲草率直表示意見。渠云：使憲草保特廣泛之基礎以容納各種意見，其意雖良佳，但渠難以了解何以現存之若干貿易壁壘，仍予容忍，蓋類似性質之其他一切限制性措施，固已均予禁阻矣。金氏於述及中國國際收支之失却平衡及經濟復興計劃之暹　未能付諸施行後，即曰：中國希望得有機會以更縝密切硏究憲章內不足减輕反將增加中國當前困難之若干條文。按金氏將在今年十一月哈伐那世界貿易大會之籌備委員會全體會議中發言。貿易憲章草案於向哈伐那會議提出前，須經籌委會全體會議通過。</p>

<h3>日爭取國外市塲　將採取傾銷政策</h3>
<p>外商均認日貨品質低劣</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿三日電〕日政府爲爭取對外貿易，輸出品將不採取統制價格制度，已決定在物價　中設置專司決定輸出品價格之一委員會。此一委員會有權爲推銷某項輸出品，而決定其例外的出售價格，換言之，該委員會將有權不顧輸出品之成本，而決定其對外傾銷價格也。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿三日電〕已抵日本之外國商業代表已在各地開始商品交易，多對日本商品批評其型式過舊，已不流行，且品質不佳而又價昂，認爲　加以改善。希望直接與製造業者會談，使其所製商品，能傾銷於世界市塲</p>
<h3>英美法三國在倫敦開會　商德國工業水準　荷比廬正式要求供給會議情報</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿之日電〕英美法三國代表今日開始在此間秘密會議。討論英美前此決定提高德國工業尤其是鋼鐵業生產水準之決議。會議塲所即爲今春四強外長代表討論德奧和約處之蘭凱斯特堂。</p>
<p>就會議初期之徵象觀，以後逐日開會情形均將保持秘密。今日之初次會議，討論者當僅爲此次會議之程序問題。據接近三國代表團之人士稱，今日所討論之題目，包括：（一）會議消息之對外傳播方式；（二）其他關係國家要求供給該會情報之討論；（三）議程各項討論之次序。此次會議預料歷時不過數日，其對外發表新聞之方式，預料　爲於第一次會議後發表簡短之公報，再於會議結束時發表最後公報。據極可靠方面息，荷蘭·比利時。盧森堡業已正式請求以倫敦會談之結果，知照彼等，荷蘭且復要求在未曾徵求其意見以前，不可就德國工業水準成立最後決議。此項要求可望在今日之首次會議中討論。聞英國代表團可望贊成荷，比，盧三國要求，供給情報之請求。按波茨坦會議所議定德國鋼鐵工業水準爲年產五百八十萬噸，然一九四六年度實際產量僅二百五十萬噸，蘇外長莫洛托夫在莫斯科外長會議中曾有主張提高至年產一千萬至一千三百萬噸之意，而克萊與勞勃生兩長官今年七月份所議定之暫定目標，據云係一千一百五十萬噸。</p>
<h3>英美財政會議　轉向貿易問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿二日電〕美財部今宣佈英美關於修正英國貸款協定之討論之重要階段，已吿結束。英代表團長伊第爵士將於本週末返倫敦。英美高級官員曾討論協定中關於雙方貿易中須無歧視之條款，惟並未獲致協議。伊第刻雖於美國同意英國停止以英鎊兌換美元之後回國，然其代表團之其餘團員仍將留此，討論協定中「貿易須無歧視」條款。依據該條款，英國須購買美國產品，除非其在其他方面能以更低廉之價格購買此等產品。英國此外須廢止帝國優惠制以及其對自治領所予之貿易特權。</p>

<h3>電影院發生工潮　十餘家停止售票　星期早塲難望開晨風　社會局已定今日召集勞資雙方調解</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美琪大戲院職工因實方導反協議，未能儘先任用職工會失業會員，自昨日下午一時半起開始怠工。其他各院職工聞訊後紛紛響應，至晚有大光明。南京·滬光。國泰·卡爾登·大華·金門。麗都。金都。巴黎·皇后·新光等十餘家捲入漩渦，其他各院仍照常開映。社會局爲防止事態擴大，急派員於深晚至工會勸導，並定今”上午召集勞資雙方談判。今晨上述各院星期早塲難望開映，下午能否映出，須視今晨之談判而定。昨日怠工者爲電影院業職業工會第二分會會員，包括售票，査票，領票，出店雜役等。第一分會（放映間）職工仍照常工作。</p>
<p>直影院業勞資雙方於去年底訂有筆錄，規定各院於添用職工時應儘先錄用職工會之失業會員。最近美琪大戲院有三白俄女領票員返國，院方另向外間添僱本國女郞三人遞補。職工會乃文社會局，指責院方違反協約。社會局接獲呈文後未及召集勞資雙方調解，美琪大戲院職工於昨日下午一時半即發動怠工。第一塲電影票已售出，仍照常放映，自第二塲起即吿停演。消息傳出後，各電影院紛紛響應，職工會方面並派出「糾察隊」到各院。迄晚捲入漩渦之大光明等十餘家，亦皆停止售票，唯電影仍照常映出，其已購得票者仍可觀看。祇美琪，金門，大華三家全部停頓。各區協察局聞訊後，派出大批察至各影院維持秩序。新光戲院門前曾略有爭執，幸未生事端。</p>
<p>派員勸導　未有結果</p>
<p>社會局勞工處長沈鼎及調解科長樊振邦據報後，見形勢逐漸惡化，有波及全市電影院之可能，急派調解科副科長顧若峯及朱圭林二人，於深晚九時趕往職工會第二分會會址勸導。是時各院參加怠工職工正聚集該處，顧副科長開始勸導，吿以美琪院方違反協議固屬不當，但職工之貿然行動，事前亦欠考慮。如資方有違反協議行爲，勞方得據理向社局呈訴，由社局召集調解。如資方仍屢次不出席談判，或對社尚調解置之不理。則社局可向法院起訴予以强制執行。其最重之行政處分則爲吊銷其營業執照。今職工呈文指稱美琪大戲院違背協議，社會局尙未召集調解，職工即出此行動，且波及未曾違背勞資協議之其他各電影院其行動實有糾正之必要。勸導至深晚十一時始返，當將經過情形電吿沈處長及樊科長。爲免事態擴大計，今日雖値星期日，仍將召集勞資雙方調解以謀解決。</p>
<p>又，電影院商業同業公會定之日召開緊急會議，籌商對策。該會理事長梁其田，即美琪大戲院負責人。</p>

<h3>青滬公路刦車匪徒　查係前新四軍殘部　中彈之美人傷無大碍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑滬公路廿一晨發生股匪刦車並槍傷美人一名，詳情已誌本報昨日通訊版。自該案發生後，本市負責治安當局極爲重視，昨日並由警局偵緝科派外事股長陶賡榮，股員徐國基等，前往實地調査，該被刦之車輛係美海軍辦事處所有之小吉普，車號一二八一一，受傷之美人乃該辦事處職員喬奇勞脫，現正由美海軍醫院療治中，聞傷勢尙無大碍，約一星期後即可出院。</p>
<p>據喬奇稱是日偕同事潘萊及女友二人，駕駛海軍軍用士普赴佘山遊一玩，迨興盡歸返時已屬深夜十二時，常車過靑滬路十五號橋（屬靑浦縣轄境）方家窰地方時，烙旁突竄出匪徒十餘名，半數均着草綠色制服，出槍喝令停車，喬奇等初未置理，乃加速前進，致遭匪怒，開槍射擊，一彈中喬奇臀部後，卒因負創，失却駕駛能力，衝入路勞稻地內。匪徒等遂乘機趕到包圍，並以槍柄痛擊喬奇及潘萊，若千匪徒即開始搜刦，計被刦法幣三十餘萬元，鑰匙一串，打火機一只。是時，適有滿載魚販之卡車一輛經過，匪徒乃棄車蜂擁至路中，將該車攔截洗刧，歷時頗久，其後復以同樣方式洗刧另一卡車，直至淸晨六時，因遙見一軍車由滬駛來，匪徒始作鳥獸散。喬奇等因車輪陷入泥田，無法啓行，旋經路過鄕人援助，將車推至公路上，始由潘萊鴛駛返滬，當即將受傷者送入海軍醫院醫治，一面向當局報吿經過。昨日美海軍醫院已將喬奇臀部柑出之彈頭，送至警局檢騐。據警局調査結果，得悉此項股匪係前新四軍顧福生之殘部，人數約七八十名，擁有步槍十餘枝，手槍三枝，平時出沒於黄波紀王廟一帶，爲害非淺，惟因該處地屬靑浦縣轄境，須待請示本市治安最高當局後，始能會同前往搜剿。</p>

<h3>消失了黃金時代的彭蠡航線　在掙扎中</h3>
<p>〔本報鄱陽廿日訊〕鄱陽湖爲江西全省唯一的水庫，朶育着贛，饒，撫，信，修，五大幹支流，昌樂兩江，居鄱湖支流的上游，昌江，發源於毘連浮梁之祁門，樂江，發源於接壞德興之婺源，各有水程三百餘里，兩江的水，都在被濤汹湧下日夜不息的長流着，昔日曾爲沿江人類生活上盡了最大的努力，過去是把婺源，德興，萬平，祁門，浮梁，鄱陽，一帶的土產，成船滿儎一批一批的運輸出去，同時又把蘇，滬，漢，潯，的華洋商貨成船滿儎一批一批的運輸進來。</p>
<p>我國最著名的景德瓷器，樂平鳴山的錳煤，鄱陽的菸葉糧食，更有佔出口貿易大宗祁紅綠的洋莊茶葉，端靠它吐納內外，有無相通的需要，助成了沿江工商商業餘年來無上的繁榮。所以昌樂兩江的支流，是沿河各縣商業特產品唯一的生命綫，在過去沒有輪軌交通的這塊腹地，民航的重要性，可想像而知了。</p>
<p>昔日繁榮</p>
<p>滿儎揚帆競賽</p>
<p>鄱湖航運工具，單就民船一類來講：有多至六十餘種，全省內河大小船隻，約達十萬艘之多，船工五十萬人。最著的有撫船，巴斗，鴉尾，刁子，滿江紅，晚蓮船，鴉梢，　梢，搖划，樂平船，鴨央等，船的形狀各殊，名稱不一，載重弗同，速率亦異。在民國初年，鄱陽內湖昌，樂江及上饒，河口，弋陽，等支流，共有有大小船隻，航行於上述各綫的，約達五萬艘以上，依靠操船業爲生的，約有二十五萬人。</p>
<p>當時沿湖各縣的土產，如祁門，浮梁，河口，的紅茶，婺源，德興，玉山，餘江的綠茶，景德鎭的瓷器，鄱陽的蓮子，菸葉，樂平的靑靛，煤炭，德興的糖紙，以及萬年，餘干，等縣的麻豆雜糧，都是經過昌樂江集匯鄱湖轉運九江出口的，各縣外來的商貨，亦恃這多民船源源的輸入，計算全年特產和商貨輸出輸入，數量至堪驚人。故當時民船運業，爲一個適應時代最繁榮的時期。</p>
<p>船業載貨水脚，春夏稍平秋冬倍漲，船戶招攬載貨，同業時起爭端，承運開航，都搶快縮短時間，以迅捷的努力，趕達目的地；又迅捷地攬貨裝載而回。那時候沿湖各河流的布帆飽挂，有如端節的競賽龍舟。船戶收入旣豐，生活自亦隨之舒裕，每値揚帆破浪，時聞船工呼嘯之聲，篙撑逆流，哼哼鼓進，其一種安心專業的精神，不禁令人羡水上生涯的眞樂矣。</p>
<p>曾經滄海</p>
<p>篙工輟業沉舟</p>
<p>自民十八年秋，赤禍蔓延贛篙工輟業沉舟北，方邵共匪崛起贛東，侵擾樂平，浮梁，德興，萬年，諸縣，鄱湖沿河交通，都被阻斷。祁門，婺源，箱茶，景德瓷器，都改由旱道桃遝至屯溪出口。其他各縣特產，亦多改途易轍，多數農產品，因爲匪擾的不安耕作，出產日就衰微。商家爲避危就安，外來貨物，都主縮進，且多由陸路車運入境。因是沿湖的民船遝業，頓呈衰落的絕境，上下船隻，完全停航，船戶生活，愈苦難支。其間或賣舟改業，歸鄉務農；或沉舟於水，冀日他日復業，或破舟作薪，以示輟業的堅志。在這數年間，偶過沿湖瞧望，綠楊河畔，不見繫舟；蘆葦灘邊，絕聞篙響，此一時間景色的特殊，眞令人有不勝今昔之感！</p>
<p>至民二十三年後，匪禍漸次敉平，各地商業工產，也漸漸地向復興的坦途邁進。誰也想不到正謀恢復間，接着蘆溝橋的砲聲又起，抗戰烽火由華北而蔓延到東南，長江航路，復被封鎖。內河民船航業。旣無貨運，且多差役，雨霽雲開甫吿復航的民船，如曇花一現的又陷入民十八年以後的狀態。時代所賜予它們的掙扎良機，又被消逝失去，它們無疑的一樣如在陷區人民的生活財產，同蒙巨大損失而無可挽回。前歲復員後，原子彈的威聲</p>
<p>今時復航</p>
<p>祗作最後掙扎</p>
<p>前歲復員後，原子彈的威聲，使未絕如縷時代落伍的交通工具民船業，如被春風之吹植，再度復生起來了，聰明的商人，遂丢去以前來往的車運捷徑，從而便用民船故道，爲它們貨物吐納的服務工作。在這一年來，原有的船戶，雖然漸漸的恢復航行，但究不若以前船運業的洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>說到今日的航運，鄱陽仍不失爲船集的中心，沿湖數里，船隻排列，桅杆如林。每日均有民船，輪船，分駛各地，走樂平，放南昌，向九江，往鷹潭，開河口，淸晨傍晚，汽鳴相應，依然有多少人自茲離別，多少人到這重逢，揚中目送之情，握手道歡之聚，相逢萍水，作客盡是他鄕，此情此景，猶彷彿當年意境的盛况。</p>
<p>鄱陽，是這樣洋溢着離愁聚樂的一個水碼頭，還有一噸一噸的黑煤，一簍一簍的瓷器，一箱一箱的茶葉，更有一袋一袋的米穀和雜糧，從贛東北各產區，集匯到這裏，然後由煤輪，汽輪，羅統，刁子，撫船，各式各樣的船隻，分道到南昌，九江，各地去，再由南昌，九江，運來棉紗，運來布疋，運來舶來品，又送進各縣農村內地來，一出一人之間，貨生所給予的代價，當然養活了不少的船戶和船工。</p>
<p>可是時過境遷，浙贛，南潯，鐵路，均先後修竣通車，京贛鐵道，現在是有人提議恢復建築了，此外皖，浙，贛，間的幹支公路，亦在加緊搶修，敏銳的商人，到這時自然是又丢去交通落後的運具，而就便利增强的鐵道和公路，作爲它們貨物的運輸工具了，雖然有些鐵道公路不往的內地，仍然靠着民船來裝載，但是佔計剩餘的數量，一定是很低微。一般聰明的船戶，明知它們的衰途，眼見着横阻在前面，爲着衣食的驅使，這時候，都抱着「做一日和尙撞一日鐘」的想，暫維目前的生活，姑作最後的掙扎而已。（特約記者兪寗頗）</p>

<p>〔無錫廿日訊〕無錫所以魚米之鄉，而名聞全國，數千年來，無論城鄕居民，無不豐衣飽食，很少發生集體的變亂，不幸在本年的五月五日，因爲米價從八萬元一石，在三天之內，突然激漲到二十萬元以上，有很多米店因之拒售食米，就引起了搶米風潮，雖經警察當局派警彈壓，可是怒潮亦未能及時退止。不到半日，搶風延及城廂內外，直到深夜由駐軍協助，實施戒嚴，纔把這個嚴重的局面平息下去，總計損失至五六千石以上。</p>
<p>最近，米價雖從二十多萬又昇到四十多萬元一石了，這應歸功於縣政當局的處置有方，社會治安很平靜，在最近一個月裏，各地的米糧，像潮水般的湧來，全縣幾十家堆棧，都堆滿了米麥·雜糧·使後到者無法上倉，從三里橋到吳橋以外的雙河口的河道中，米船首尾相述的　接着，沒有絲毫空隙，最多時停泊有五千多艘，這些米船的來源，近的是附近鄰縣，也有遠自湖南四川來者，因爲當地米價賤，都不遠數千里而趕到無錫來求售，於是遂造成了數百年來從朱有過的盛况。</p>
<p>從最近的無錫米市的盛况看來，各地鬧的米荒，似尙有詳細調査統計的必要，假使當局能够把全國的米糧詳細硏究其產銷情况，而加以合理的調節與流通，我相信米荒一定可以减少其嚴重性的。（錫麟）</p>

<h3>滬各界首長昨茶會商討　清寒獎學金問題　目標五十億即席認捐足額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各界首長吳國楨。潘公展·方治·宣鐵吾。嚴莊。杜月笙。徐寄廎。吳開先·吳紹澍·顧毓琇·朱經農等十一人，爲協助本市各級學校淸寒學生，舉辦獎學金，特聯名東請各界熱心人士，於昨日下午四時，假國際飯店十四樓舉行茶會，商討勸募淸寒學生獎學金問題。來賓到王曉籟·吳蘊初·劉攻芸·梅蘭芳·王芸生·程中行·汪竹一·及大專校長章益·歐元懷·戴粹倫等八十餘人。敎育部次長杭立武適於昨晨蒞滬，亦被邀參加。</p>
<p>學費過高咸感焦慮</p>
<p>首由主席吳市長致詞，說明各校行將開學，大中小學學生，以學費過高，咸感焦慮，尤以淸寒學生爲然。鑒於最近各校學生自動紛起舉辦各項助學義賣，足證學生苦况，渠等經常沿街義買，不唯危及學生安全，且足影響社會秩序，吾人亟應設法協助下代學生安心求學。本人已與各方作初步會商，全市組織統一助學機構，統籌辦理。凡捐款機關，仍可保存名義，如此衆擎易舉，以期公平。贊成是項原則捐款者，均可參加此機構監督之。詳細辦法會後另商。吳開先氏繼起稱：此次應使獲得獎學金之學生，務使知捐款來源，成績優良者，以後繼續給獎，同時捐款者，可指定學生，硏究專門學術，畢業後，並保障其職業，優良受獎學生，必可安心向學。陸幹臣氏以靑年會歷年辦理獎學金之經騐，認爲獎學金應求普遍，建議由各校校長及有關力面硏究良好辦法施行。</p>
<p>擴大籌募經常進行</p>
<p>程中行氏應邀發言，說明新聞報已往捐獻獎學金，經久未輟，渠認爲個人財富，取之於社會，亦應貢獻社會，擴大籌募，尤應經常進行。王芸生氏致詞稱：國家應注重國民敎育。敎育經費預算太少，所定六年義務敎育，迄未實施，不能與日本相比，麥克阿瑟元帥，現令日本再辦三年强迫敎育，我國戰時以還，大學生供給公費，形成偏枯現象。下期起，大學公費取消，籌募獎學金，自屬必要，大學負擔合理化後，應移其經費充實國民敎育，希望明年開始實行强迫敎育。至此，杭次長宣稱：敎育部刻正計劃，按照憲法規定，爭取，百分之十五之敎育經費，今後對於國民敎育當力求充實，九月一日在京舉行之遠東區基本敎育會議，足證重視國民敎育？杭氏建議各校增加學生半工半讀之服務機會，以减少靑年失學之數字。末對上海各界熱心協助淸寒學生，表示感謝。</p>
<p>協助獎學受惠匪淺</p>
<p>繼潘公展氏致詞，謂各校學費太高，不唯淸寒學生不勝負担，即一般學生家長，亦感難　子弟學費，如不亟謀解決，將來因此可引起學潮，政府及地方財力均感困難，現社會協助獎學，學子受惠匪淺。量後由復旦大學校長章益代表各大學對各界盛情，表示謝意。</p>
<p>章氏並建議兩點：（一）狹義獎學，對於學行特優之學生，予以特別獎金，（二）廣義獎學，今日社會經濟悄况不佳，一般學生均無力求學，其學行在水準以上者，應普遍獎勵，此二者可並行不悖。對於組織獎學金機構及辦法，軍氏亦多有具體建議，留交下週開會決定。茶會至七時許圓滿吿成。</p>
<p>又：吳市長在茶會中當塲宣佈，此次籌募獎學金以五十億元爲目標，各方當即席已認捐足額，並決定繼續勸募，定於下週由吳市長召集各方組織勸募機構，商討進行辦法。茲將昨日各方認捐數目如下：上海證券交易所十億元，工商銀行三億元，市銀行二億元，市政府五億元，學生抄寫選舉票五億元，申報三億元，新聞報五億元，靑年會七億元，靑年團二億五千萬元，無名氏二億五千萬元，由梅蘭芳周信芳邀請伶界名界出演義務戲，籌捐五億元，大公報認捐數目待定。</p>

<h3>收購到埠外棉審查已竣　中信訂定代紡辦法　第一批收購一九一四四包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕到埠外棉申請收購事宜，中信局業已審査完竣，此項外棉代紡代銷問題，中信局與紡調會及紡建公司曁其他各有關機關數度商討，業已訂定辦法如下：</p>
<p>（甲）關於收購部份　（一）本會收購之外棉花，如申請人係紗廠所購之棉，即交由該申請紗廠自行騐收，除與該廠訂立代紡合約，將代紡之棉花，交由該廠收存外，其餘不願代紡之棉花，（不超過五〇％）應由該廠出具本局抬頭之棧單，以便連同向非紗廠申請人所收購之外棉，除酌配一部份予七月卅一日前向六區公會申請代紡之紗廠外，餘均交由中國紡建公司騐收並代紡。</p>
<p>（二）收購之外棉，擬由購方會同代紡廠及公體行騐收，過磅後，憑碼單數量及品質付款。如國外廠商及銀行未允於過磅騐收後付款，則先付CIF上海之價款，其餘因延期付款所發生之利息，保險費，及代收款之銀行手續費等，俟棉花正式騐收後，再行核實支付。巳付保險費之外匯，及銀行手續費。（　　％）一律以官價折合法幣支付。</p>
<p>（三）如先CIF上海之價款，其紗廠申請收購棉花應按照收購棉花數量折合棉紗，繳交中信局。倘於騐收時發現損壞短少，概由紗廠自行接洽理賠。對於應繳棉花數量，不得减少，非紗廠申請時，則須備具銀行保證聲明，如有騐收短少，担保憑公證行驗收證明書，於五日內退還外匯，所有理賠由申請人負責。</p>
<p>（四）中信局與申請入簽立購售合約後，即憑銀行保證書，請中央銀行將價款撥匯國外收款人，申請人可不另出發票或收據。</p>
<p>（五）本會收購之外棉，函請輸管會以最簡捷手續，核發許可證，以便報關提貨。</p>
<p>（六）本會收購之外棉，於付款收購後，由代紡廠投保（包括在工繳內）。</p>
<p>（七）第一批申請各案，審査通過，准予收購者二十四案，計棉花一九·一四四包，其與原規定日期未盡符合者六案，彙出簽呈總裁核准後，予以收購。</p>
<h3>代紡各紗廠一個月交紗</h3>
<p>（乙）關於代紡及外銷部份（一）各代紡廠應於騐收後一個月內交紗，先將交貨日程表及提單送中信局。（申新因數量較多，准限一個半月內交淸，紡建本身讓售之外棉，即交現紗，其餘代紡交紗期限，另行個別商定）。</p>
<p>（二）提單送達中信局時，即照核定之工繳，全部支給代紡廠應用。</p>
<p>（三）代紡棉紗按照棉花程式商定，應交棉紗支數，惟爲便利代紡趕速交貨，其折合率以換取同數外匯爲原則。</p>
<p>（四）各代紡廠所交棉紗，統由紡建公司騐收，連同紡建自行代紡棉紗，由紡建接洽外銷，並與中信局洽商決定。惟代紡廠亦不妨先行接洽外銷，最後與紡建公司及中信局會商決定。</p>
<p>（五）外埠紗廠代紡所需工繳，及來回運費相加，以不超過本埠紗廠工繳爲原則。</p>
<p>（六）工繳費用紡建公司所提廿支紗工繳爲二，四一八，八四六，二六元，（包括東北損失五十萬元在內），公會所提廿支紗工繳爲二，七二九，〇二五，二九元，另加利潤百分之十，公會認爲所提數字不能再减，紡建公司認爲公會數字甚合理，且較紡調會所定者爲低，經決議簽請總裁核定。</p>

<h3>托馬斯曼論文集</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>德國大文豪托馬斯曼（Thomas　Mann）在我們的文化上佔有特殊的地位。他的聲譽很大，但讀過他偉大作品的人，對於他的思想，仍舊不甚了解。這是値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>如果我們肯定現存兩大文學家是蕭伯納和托馬斯曼，沒有人會覺得驚訝的。不渦蕭伯納常雜以嘲戲，托馬斯曼則否。托馬斯曼頗像法國的孔耐爾（Corneille）或英國的彭瓊生（Ben　Jonson）。他最近又常寫政論文章，這在他的光榮上又增加了一分光榮。</p>
<p>現在他的「三十年間的散文」（Essays　of　Three　Decades）已經由羅威鮑特爾（HT'Lowe-Porter）譯成英文，這本論文集可以回答下面的問題：曼到底站在哪一方面？我們也許要這樣回答：他一方面是宣揚理性的福音，反劉法西斯蒂的無理性，一方面又是反對西方文化的選手，那末他又似乎自己也站在無理性的一面了。其實曼是一個多方面的人，思想是逐漸發展的。他在年靑的時候，感覺到西方的知識階級過於理性。後來法西斯蒂的汩沒理性席捲歐洲，曼就立刻很明朗地走到理性的防衛一邊。但曼仍舊還是曼。除了很稀少的政治的熱情時候，他覺得現代的自由心理是表面的，缺乏宗敎和悲劇的深度。曼以爲自由主義者該學習叔本華，華格涅和尼采。</p>
<p>後來曼又從東方主義和國家主義解放出來，這在五年前美國所出版的他那「時代的秩序」（Crder　of　the　Day）可以看出.這是政治的解放。至於哲學的解放則爲現在所出的這本「三十年間的散文」。哥德是曼的救命圈，弗洛以德拋給他救命繩。哥德調和知慧與本能，光明與黑暗，甚爲成功。弗洛以德顯示理性可以很勇敢地面對無理性，甚至可以直啗窟穴。曼不像自由的樂覜主義者，却是面對着「死」的。但他不像頽廢派的無理性，他並不願望死亡。他認爲死可以用愛米克服，理性不能克服死。對於那些肯定人生的近代作家，曼恐怕是看得較爲深刻的；對於那些看得深刻的近代作家，曼恐怕是最美麗地肯定人生的。</p>
<p>我們說曼轉向到民主，或說他是屬於德國布爾喬亞或浪漫派，似乎都只對了一半。他自己知道，他還有後者活着，但後者却是包含在前者裏面的。曼是「民主的象徵」，我們知道得很多；曼是「反動的」，我們却還不曾知道。</p>
<p>「三十年間的散文」是比「時代的秩序」更能令人滿意的書。說實話，曼不是一個政論家。他不能假裝社會的先知，他是詩人，他的內心是自然與精神的調和者。讀他那論施篤謨（Storm）。芳丹（Fontane）或恰米梭（Chamisso）的小文章，總覺得比看他那吿德國人民書米得滋補。</p>
<p>最近的這一本書可惜不曾包含所有曼的非政治性的文章。歐洲大戰一九三九年後的文章一篇也不曾收進去，一九三三年所刋「過去的大師們」（Past　Masters）裏最好的文章也不曾採進去，連「弗洛以德在近代思想史上的位置」也不曾加人。不過，道仍舊是一本豐富的書，對於所討論的題目和曼的趣味與見解，都充分地表現出米。他的論文極有深度與廣度，旣非單是個人的，亦非嚴格客觀的。長好的文章有三篇：「哥德與托爾斯泰」。「華格湼的苦難與偉大」。「叔本華」。要想了解托馬斯曼的思想，亦當看這三篇。</p>
<p>這是一本好書。評者也許認為難於看出他的確當的思想。現在且將托馬斯曼對於寫作的觀感寫在下面，以作結束。</p>
<p>一個作家應該有腦筋。曼說：「一個完全愚蠢的詩人常夢想浪漫的自然崇拜。」但單只有腦子還不够，甚至加上天生的創作天才也還不够。曼說起，還要兩個要素：文化與傳統。在歐美，每每一個有腦子的作家，他的作品成爲暢銷之　，便可成爲名流，舒服地度過他的餘生。每逢有新著出版，讀書會便介紹他的書，他可以得到很大的收入。曼以爲他還應該不顧生活環境如何，仍舊照老樣子，靜悄悄地逐漸工作，不要喜而忘形。</p>
<p>另一部分作家的練習，曼以爲應該熱心硏究大師們的工作，熱誠地接受文化遺產。甚至最偉大的作家都有終身做學徒的。托馬斯曼的謙虛實在値得驕傲。他在一篇論文裏常自稱為華格理的學生。另一論文中討論到哥德的偉大，他說：「我們現代人不過是火的傳導者。」這種謙虛不是我們作家所應該學習的麽？但是這樣的人是多末地少呵！</p>
<p>以上所述，都是班特萊（Eric　Bentley）的評介。據「哥倫比亞近代歐洲文學辭典」面五一〇所述，托馬斯曼一九三三年後住在瑞士，他在那兒辦了一個刋物「量與値」（Mass　und　We。o　1937）。一九三八年他到美國以後，又出版了兩本政論文「民主勝利的來臨」（The　Coming　Vitory　of　Democracy）和「這個和平」（This　Peace）。托馬斯曼還寫過四卷本的長篇小說鉅著，則爲：（一）傑科伯的故事（Die　Geschichten　Jakobs,1933）年靑的約瑟（Der　Juge　Joseph,　1935）（三）約瑟在埃及（Joseph　in　Aegypten,1636）（四）工人約瑟（Joseph,derrErnahrer,1944）。此外他還作有「羅特在威瑪」（Lotte　in　Weinar　1940），和中篇小說「換頭」（Die　VertauschtenKopfe,　1940）等。</p>
<h3>畫家的人格</h3>
<p>— 史良黻</p>
<p>在六朝東晋以前，我國繪畫思想還沒有成爲一個體系，一班畫家在片斷的畫論裏，對於人格兩個字，無不尊之爲繪畫的靈魂。古有工匠畫家之別，人格即其分野；王羲之的「學畫論」首先提到的便是畫家的人格問題，他認爲作品的雅俗與否，完全視其個性的雅俗與否而定</p>
<p>的確，古今來許多史實，證明這是一個顚撲不破的眞理。</p>
<p>誰都知道，中國畫是以「氣韻生動」作爲品評的標準，氣韻生動除表現於外在的筆墨之間，又發之於內在的身分與人格，內外互相因果，氣韻自然流露。</p>
<p>翻開畫論，很少不談「人格」的，下面引證三則，即可知其一班：</p>
<p>沈宗騫說：「筆墨雖出於手，實根於心，鄙吝滿懷，安得超逸之致，矜情未釋，何來冲穆之神」？</p>
<p>張浦山說：「大痴爲人坦白瀟落，故其畫平淡而沖濡……倪雲林一味絕俗，故其畫蕭遠峭逸，若王叔明未免貪榮附熱，故其畫近於躁，趙文敏大節不惜，故其書畫皆嫵媚而帶俗氣。』</p>
<p>文徵明說：「人品不高，用墨無法，乃知點墨落紙大非易事，必須胸中廓然無一物，然後烟雲秀色與天地生生之氣自然湊泊筆下，幻出奇詭，若是營營世念，澡雪未盡，即日對丘壑日摹妙蹟，到頭只與髹采圬墁之工爭功拙於毫釐也。』</p>
<p>此外再舉一個事實：</p>
<p>「畫眼」上曾有這樣一段記載：「梅花道人吳仲圭本與盛子昭比門而居，四方以金帛求子昭畫者甚衆，而仲圭之門　然，妻子頗笑之，仲圭曰：二十年後不復爾。果如其言；盛雖工，實有筆墨畦徑，非若仲圭之蒼蒼莾莾，有林下風氣，所謂氣韻非耶。」蓋盛子昭的所以沒落，實因其圖利一如市儈，久之，作品雖工，在人們的心理上和他的畫面上，却已蒙上了一層市儈氣氛。縱稱工緻，也就不足珍貴了。</p>
<p>在書堆裏像這類的批評，論斷，史實，假如你留心的探求，實在不勝枚舉，足見古代畫家對於品行的操守是如何的珍視？</p>
<p>相反的，目前的中國畫壇呢；這幾年來，由於連天烽火，在整個國家經濟恐慌的窘態之下大家爲了生活疲於奔命，在朝在野官民人等均無暇顧到「敦品」，從事藝運的畫家，也不例外，一樣的不大重視『人品不高，用墨無法導」敎條。因此今日之盛子昭簡直是車載斗量，比比皆是！非但如此，更有不少畫人，志不在畫，而以畫爲橋樑，奔走於權貴之門，增營求顯，如與子昭比擬，更是不如的了！</p>
<p>至於像吳仲圭以及朱耷石濤等畫家的作風，上海人視之，誰不笑爲阿Q？</p>
<p>當然，我並不贊成畫家與社會絕緣，也不能說畫家可以枵腹。但是以畫爲貨，營利至上，此風之猖獗，畢竟是國畫前途的一個嚴重危機，質諸高明，以爲然否？</p>
<h3>西子粧慢　秋感</h3>
<p>— 徐邦達</p>
<p>秋入衰梧，蟬吟轉切，暗省西施眉嫵，玉繩低處夜何其。倚危樓，鳳吹怨曲。（叶上）靑天自古，况碧海年年深阻；算人間，截廻紋蘇錦，輕離愁聚。　長亭路，折盡柔條，也解無情緒；更堪搖落楚臣心；賦登臨，斷雲零雨，文　漫舞，奈分向江楓蕭鼓，只寒潮衝急，沈沈遠浦。</p>
<h3>一位自學的美術青年</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>周東光是我的靑年朋友，他走了五六年的自學的艱辛道程，付出了相當的努力，到今天，可說是已經踏了成功的第一步階石。</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭開端以後的第一個春天，貽德要到內地去了，當臨走的前一晚，他對我說：『南翔的小學敎師周東光，是對繪畫抱着十二分的熱忱的靑年朋友，以後希望你多多給他一點指導。」</p>
<p>原來，東光，在廿九年（？）尼特畫室招收暑期學生的時候，他是每天以自由車代步從南翔到貽德所辦的畫室來學畫的朋友。暑假過後，他還是每星期日挾着自己的作品到上海來向貽德請敎的。他雖然在南翔担任某小學的敎師，可是，在敎學之餘，把全部的時間和精力完全費在繪畫硏究之上。他沒有「模特兒」，只有鄉村的田野；他沒有油彩和畫架，只有簡單的一些水彩畫的器材。可是他並不灰心，相反的，在工作繁重，物質窘迫之下，確獲得了報酬，這報酬，便是前幾日在大新畫廳中公開展覽的幾十幅水彩畫。</p>
<p>東光曾經爲了自已發覺素描基礎的薄弱，常常和我商量要進美術學校讀書。然而、在這年頭，一個鄕村小學的敎師，有怎樣的力量負担美術學校的費用？幸而，詠森答應了我的要求，把東光收作蘇州美專滬校的免費生，終於，他是在半工半讀的情况之下結束了初步的學程。這雖然是學校敎育的功能，可是在東光，我只認爲這還是他自學的應得的成果。不信，美術學校畢業的學生相當的多，能够有東光一樣雖云微薄的成就，據我所知道，人數是並不怎樣的多，何况，東光還是一個窮學生呢？</p>

<p>耀羣一瞧，這才恍然大悟，心下一切雪亮，便也不動聲色，問着小老虎；「怎麽你也跑到車站來的？」</p>
<p>「瞧，紀姨，」小老虎把那雙大圓眼睛，貶了幾眨；「我要不來，您這一袋鈔票就算沒了。準虧我在您身後看見，就把那傢伙抓住，把這袋袋給奪了渦來，您瞧不是？」小老虎把錢袋揚了起來；認爲他這編造的故事，臺無一漏洞。</p>
<p>「你這一套不成，虎弟！」　羣綳起了臉：「怎麽辦我也不能帶你去。走，咱們還是回去；我也不走了。」</p>
<p>「媽已經答應我哪！」小老虎見自己這麼功妙一套「瞞天過海」的奇計，一下就呌耀　識破，只得使出賴皮的老方子；「我不回去！…您回去，我也不回去。北平我去過、我找張老叔去…」說着他抓起了自己的一隻小包袱，就預備去買票。</p>
<p>耀羣無法，只好迎哄帶騙，答應回寨商量；「就說去，也沒這麽容易，還得領『通行證」，辦進關手續，……」這才把小老虎騙了出站。二人剛待雇軍，旅舍裏已經派人坐車追了來，說龍五爺和小老虎的母親都上城裏來了，也眞的答應了讓小老虎跟耀羣一路上北平。</p>
<p>「這孩子也眞跟您投緣，」小老虎的媽對耀羣福了兩福；「您就成全了他罷；讓他去兌識見識，反正這孩子有些鬼聰明，又有幾下手脚，您也眞得這們一個孩子，跑跑腿哪什麽的，……誰呌您一直這麽疼他？……」</p>
<p>這是前幾星期的事。</p>
<p>連耀羣也沒胡到這麼快又回來了；更沒想到瀋陽局面又有轉變，變得這麼快，這麽加倍嚴重；所以在回老寨的這段路上，也不得不加倍的謹愼小心了。</p>
<p>一到這第四站，耀羣打發了車子，連夜回城，便和小老虎匆匆換了裝束，接過了馬鞭，同小老虎各人一騎，追風逐電，飛馳而去。</p>
<p>這時，您要是凑巧也在這一帶山區徘徊着，借着一輪落月的餘輝，就可看見谷底一綫蜿蜒的小徑上，兩騎劣駒，連形帶影，如同兩小團黑雲被旋風捲着，一前一後，奔馳追逐。再要逼近一看，您就恍如置身當日騎士時代的爲面中，親親一輩劍客豪俠，爲了人間不平，怒馬馳驟的特寫鏡頭。這時耀華和小老虎，遵照寨中夜行規矩，都頭上籠着風兜，肩上罩着披風，全部深藍顏色；腰下一邊插着一隻德式十響，鞍子上還平縣着一隻實彈馬槍。凑巧老寨的馬匹，多半都是蒙古和日本的改良種，深棕和棗色居多數，所以連人帶馬，在月光下，成功烏雲一團。</p>
<p>照理，老寨各條路綫，都有佈置，旅行應當安全，何必定要這樣全身披掛，弄得如此火辣辣地，如臨大敵一般？殊不知東北這個地區，一離城市和公路，就算從二十世紀，重又回到了十五世紀，除了大隊集團，再加武裝護送，確實不易行走，那二毛子，紅鬍子，不肖的杆子，中了毒的韓人，日本浪人，掛名的偵緝，都是劃一不二的暴客，尤其在這大山深谷森林荒漠的小徑上，人人都有突遭製擊的危險；所以武裝警備，成了必需。</p>

<p>爲乘客衛生打算，三輪車。人力車　射DDT，我們舉手贊成。</p>
<p>但是二輪車人力車夫，常常整天在街頭流着奧汗，乘客在常風疾馳時，往往鹹酸撲鼻，這股味道，似乎不大衛生。即使　射DDT，又有什麽用？</p>
<p>話不得不拉開去，三輪車夫和他們貧民窟裏，倒眞的需要「衛生」一下的，不知可有這許多免費供應的DDT？</p>

<h3>日貨泛濫之夢</h3>
<p>— 王潤園</p>
<p>—味　素·考篤眼藥都來了！</p>
<p>在上海虹口，偶而看到日商殘留的招牌，地攤上售賣些零碎的日貨，總覺得不順服，心想總有一天，會乾乾凈凈的把這東西除掉，來到上海已一年了，但仍然會見到店屋未洗刷掉的招牌圖案，字蹟，也偶然看到吃食店仍擺着若素，藥店裏陳列些不知醫什麼病的藥。這也是同胞們太懶了，竟沒有注意到這若人不快的招牌，或者日本商人留下的存貨太多了，買的人不多，所以經年累月还销不掉，誰想到從八月十五日之後這些招牌，廣吿仍然有用，存貨不但不能銷完，新的又將要大量運來了呢！</p>
<p>立秋後的夜晚，究竟是凉快多了，愛睡的人儘可尋些好夢，倚在床檻邊，拿着一份報紙，眼　是在看，可是腦筋在昏昏的想些什麽，以後已不知報上的字究竟是什麼了，忽然間我回到了那遙遠的家鄕，耘田的人身上都穿上了長崎大阪紗廠出的布夾襖，村姑們也都添上一件花洋布的大衫，我驚奇的連話也說不出，明明記得家裏寫信給我，說東西太貴，年月不太平，速一寸布也買不起衣裳都補了又補，對付着過日子，怎麽，並沒有這回事！但家裏是不會騙我，其中必有原因，我忍不住問了老隣居家的二嫂，矣，二嫂沒說話先嘆了一口氣，自從日本投降後，伙兩年了，誰家能買件新衣穿？布貴得比緞子還兇，我家小三自落生到現在，也沒穿上一件新衣，把大的改，二的穿，二的改，三的穿，最近布便宜了，說是日本貨又來啦，管他什麽日本中國呢！便宜點我就買二尺添補，添補。我聽了，一陣說不出的不自在，唉，對，回到家裏，很高興，多年不見的親人又都見着了，談了一些別後的情形，年紀大的頭髮又添了些白霜，年紀小的也長了半尺，小弟弟本來在地下爬，現在也背了書包，一增念的書紙是日本貨，鉛筆，日本貨，小刀，日本貨，沒一樣不是日本貨，除了毛筆外，怎麽你們都用起日本貨來了？日本戰敗沒到兩年，誰管什麽貨，便宜就得。小弟弟覺得回答我很聰明，我啞口無言因爲第一天到家，大家都還喜歡，老太太特爲我做點好菜，一方面是多年沒有吃着家鄕味，二方面是老太太親自燒的，覺得非常可口，不覺連聲說好吃，老太太也很得意，便接着答道，菜是圍子裏長的，新鮮，裏面放點「味　素」，就格外提味，兩年都買不到好「味　素」，現在又有了，我沒話說，心裏就是覺得不對勁。</p>
<p>第二天到離家裏二里路的縣城去拜望親戚，一進城門，街上的招貼很多，什麼東洋堂，什麼株式會社，什麽丸內，老篤眼藥，大學眼藥，利比兒，簡直是日本地了，除了瓦房沒變，一切都是日本貨充滿了商店，我不能忍耐了，心裏想逍是什麽話，趕快離開道裏，匆匆的探了幾家親戚，回到家裏，當天晚上便說上海有事，不能久住，家裏人都不以爲然，但也不能把我扣住，懷着一類沉重的心，又乘上了火車，換了輪船，回到上海，沒下船，已看到老朋友站在碼頭上接我，心裏一喜，等船靠好了，搶下船去握手寒暄，這才仔細一打量，這位老朋友的衣着，簇新的藏靑嗶嘰西裝，鮮艷的領帶，我說老陸，怎麽最近很得意吧？行頭也翻新了。老陸說，別挖苦人，從前衣料動則二百幾十萬，還是國貨的，好西洋貨，千把萬，咱們拿什麼做？現在日本呢羢來了，比較說是便宜多了，所以趁機會來上一套，你別奇怪，到市面上看看，東西有很多便宜了，雖然錢不値錢，不過日本貨就比別的貨便宜。我眞呆了，想不到上海也又回到勝利前的老樣了，心中快快不樂，挾着行李，雇了輛車，回到住的地方，姐姐看我回來了，問些家裏的事，無精打彩的談了一些。第二天到廠銷假，廠址本是工廠區，勝利後不冒烟的烟囱本就很多，這二年因經濟不安定，開工的也有，因賠不起的而不得不再關不知多少，這回更不對了，好多廠關了門，尤其是一些輕工業的小廠，本來就照架不住，再受日本貨的傾銷影響，競爭不過，只好關門大吉。我說完了，完了，八載抗戰，血白流了。中國人生就的命運，準得再讓日本重演一次經濟侵略的禍害嗎？心裏一酸，不覺放聲大哭。忽聽姐姐呌我，醒醒吧，在做什麼夢？是不是女朋友又變了心？我睜開眼睛一君，室內燈火通明，手裏仍拿着報，便知這剛才是做夢，總不信夢得這樣奇怪，便原原本本的跟姐姐談。姐姐說，這也不是夢，明年八月十五也許就這樣，不信你明年回家一趟看，上海也差不離。但我可永遠希望是個夢。</p>

<h3>頑貓阿咪（九）</h3>
<p>— 張樂平作</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>諷刺喜劇「假鳳虛凰」</p>
<p>由於理髮業工會的提出反對，並要求禁演該片，使這部「假鳳虛凰」的影片鬧得全上海臺人皆知。結果，這糾紛却使「文華」獲得了意外的宣傳效果。</p>
<p>但這部戲裏究竟有侮辱理髮匠嗎？</p>
<p>當我們看過後，肯定的回答是沒有。劇作者把三號與七號這一對理髮匠描寫得那樣善良純樸，而女主角范如華倒是個愛慕虛榮，習於享樂的人。但她的本質上，依然是個善良者。否則她最後不會放棄她的享受而嫁給「三號」。甚至她也加入在時代理髮館中當修指甲女郞。這一切都說明了自食其力者的可貴，而范如華的覺　，才是她應該走的正路。</p>
<p>不過在編劇的技巧上講來，這不能算是個上乘的喜劇。劇本的寫作上，似乎不够乾淨琍落，而導演佐臨的處理上，顯然很下了一番工夫。但由於導演者對電影技巧的不够熟習，所以許多塲與塲之間的街接較為生硬，尤其剪接不妥處更多。大體上講來，一個新導演有如此成績，是可以算作稱職的。</p>
<p>石揮與李麗華是全劇中戲最吃重的一對主角，石揮的演技較爲熟練，李麗業在相形之下，顯得較爲生硬。葉明的「七號」太拘謹而呆板。全劇中以路珊的陳小姐與張琬的張太太爲最佳。</p>
<p>我們不知道「文華」當局爲什麼要用李麗華來主演這部片子？不健忘的觀衆，大槪還記得淪陷時那一部日僞合作的「春江遺恨」，女主角就是這位靦覥與敵携手合作的李麗華。</p>
<p>沉悶的心理片「病美人」</p>
<p>近來好萊塢流行攝製心理片。這部一病美人」便是屬於這一類的戲。但這些所謂心理片，假如嚴格地說起來，都不過是此，膚淺的心理分析，充其量，不過望觀衆調換一下口味罷了。</p>
<p>「病美人」是由但爾福遜的舞台劇改編過來的，正由於改編者的技術較差，所以整個戲依然侷限於一座住宅裏，而劇中有着精神病的女主角伊英玲，却需要幽美淸雅的環境來治療，可是改編者需要她着力於攪亂這個安樂的家庭，使她儘量在這宅屋子裏發展—做戲。因此她只是彼牽着的傀儡，在情理上發展，是非常牽强的。</p>
<p>導演對這個戲的處理，也較沉悶，中間的戲拖得很長，以至後面的念轉直下，略見不協調。總之，導演對戲的處理雖極細膩，仍未見精彩。</p>
<p>演員中，安娜裴絲德的病美人伊英玲，雖極努力做戲，但總沒有跑進角色裏去，比起她其他的片子，這戲是較爲遜色的。賴甫白萊梅的畫家，演技穩重而洗煉，極爲稱職。</p>
<p>不值一看的「小五義」</p>
<p>這部小五義」是美國一家小影片公司攝製的。不論編劇，導演，演員，都在水準以下的。這樣的片子即使以最低劣的國片，如「76號女間諜」，「問諜忠魂」等相較，也是有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>即使是一個最有忍耐心的觀衆，去看這部片子」，也是無法終塲的。</p>

<h3>This Morning's Departure Statement: Special Envoy Wedemeyer's Delegation Flies to Japan, Then to Korea; Report Will Be Divided into Facts and Recommendations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The US Embassy announced that General Wedemeyer's special mission will depart Nanjing for Japan at 9:30 AM on the 24th, concluding its one-month stay in China. The group will travel via Tokyo to Seoul for a brief survey of southern Korea. Furthermore, according to Watson, the press advisor to the Wedemeyer mission, Wedemeyer remained at his residence all day on the 23rd, receiving no guests. Besides focusing on official duties, he only interacted with Ambassador Stuart and his advisors, packing his belongings in preparation for the 24th departure. Due to a busy schedule of banquets and discussions this week, the final arrangement and classification of materials were not completed as expected. The mission will take all materials with them, and those arriving later will be forwarded to Seoul for continued study. Wedemeyer's final work report will be submitted to President Truman upon his return to Washington, D.C., with its content roughly divided into two major parts: facts and recommendations, to assist President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall for reference and selection. The mission will issue its final public statement as a farewell address on the morning of the 24th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] This reporter visited the office of the Wedemeyer mission in the US Embassy on the evening of the 23rd. Lieutenant Colonel Harkins, the chief of staff, political advisor Sprouse, and press advisor Watson were packing typewriters and documents. When asked by reporters about the rumor that Wedemeyer would return to China as the US Ambassador to China, spokesman Watson said, "I am unaware of that. I only know that Wedemeyer has spent most of his life in the military and still hopes to serve in a military position in the future. Therefore, after reporting the results of this trip to President Truman, he will return to Fort Meade in Maryland, where the Second Army Headquarters, which Wedemeyer commands, is located." In addition, the mission has added two sergeants as secretaries to assist the busy work of organizing data.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Before Special Envoy Wedemeyer flies to Tokyo, three boxes of classified documents, weighing over 500 pounds, will be loaded onto the special plane under armed guard. Mission personnel stated that the classified documents include reports, statistics, and memoranda, which the special envoy will use to draft a formal report to President Truman to decide the future US policy toward China. In addition, about one ton of documents from various sources has been reviewed and abridged by the special envoy and destroyed. The mission continued to work late into the night to organize the last batch of letters and telegrams.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 23rd] High-ranking Chinese official sources said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had asked General Wedemeyer to serve as his military advisor, but Wedemeyer replied that he could not accept this position. Wedemeyer's spokesman Watson neither confirmed nor denied this news, only saying, "I don't know." Wedemeyer succeeded Stilwell as commander of US forces in China in 1944 and has a very deep friendship with Chairman Chiang, so this news is not surprising. Later, an official spokesman for the special mission was invited to comment on this report, saying, "Such things do exist. The Chinese government has repeatedly suggested giving American advisors different positions." However, the special mission cannot currently state whether it will ultimately recommend assistance in advisory, material, or other aspects. Therefore, it cannot comment on such suggestions, as this suggestion is somewhat related to the recommendations we will make in our report to President Truman.</p>
<h3>Wealthy and Poor Children Alike Should Shoulder Heavy Responsibilities, Participating in the Struggle for Political and Economic Stability: Wedemeyer's Advice to Chinese Students</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 23rd] A group of Chinese students asked General Wedemeyer to help them study in the United States. Wedemeyer replied that in this "critical moment," students should stay in China and participate in the struggle for vital political and economic stability.</p>
<p>The US Embassy issued a letter on the 23rd in which Wedemeyer replied to a group of Chinese wartime translators, stating, "It is most unfortunate that Chinese students, even some professors, are unwilling to bear the great responsibility of being citizens."</p>
<p>Wedemeyer pointed out that the special treatment given to student soldiers by the government during the war was "unfair and undemocratic." He said, "The sons of the wealthy should fight alongside the sons of the poor, suffering equally. Those who are educated and those who are not share the fruits of victory equally, and they should also bear the responsibility of war equally."</p>
<p>"Every able-bodied man and woman should serve the country with enthusiasm and selflessness," as it is their sacred and unavoidable responsibility.</p>
<p>"In the recently concluded war, those who suffered the most and contributed the most were the working masses of China. Those who endured hardship and danger in the army were mostly illiterate people. In fact, many of them did not even know why they were fighting."</p>
<p>"The sons of farmers were the backbone of the small country's army. On the other hand, student soldiers were all given special preferential treatment by the government, with higher salaries, better equipment, more food, and other special attention. I believe this is unfair and clearly undemocratic."</p>
<p>"I have received many letters and verbal protests from students and intellectuals, all complaining about the stagnation of education and saying that the government should increase funding for schools. I dare to say frankly, what should the government do for the poor farmers who offer their harvests and their sons to the army?"</p>
<p>"I suggest that you seriously consider the above thoughts and discuss them with your friends." I assert that because of the patriotism you have shown during the war, you will agree that every Chinese, whether rich or poor, whether educated or not, has an unwavering responsibility to their country. If true happiness, true unity, and the realization of lasting democracy are desired, then this responsibility must be shared equally."</p>
<p>[Another report] Wedemeyer told members and ministers of the National Government on the 22nd that the Communist Party in China is not purely a military problem, but also a problem of improving the people's living standards.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer also said that the relationship between officials and the people, and between the army and the people, should be improved. The sons of the wealthy, the sons of military officers, and the sons of high-ranking government officials should also be drafted according to the new conscription plan. It is reported that Wedemeyer stated that he was making the above remarks as a friend of China, and not in his capacity as a special envoy.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Reasons for Postponing the General Election</h3>
<p>Talks with a senior official of the Election Headquarters</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] A senior official of the Election Headquarters said that only 200 to 300 of the 2,100-plus counties in our country are currently unable to hold elections. The rumor that 22 provinces cannot carry out electoral politics is not true. More than three of the nine northeastern provinces can hold elections, and only parts of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi provinces cannot promote electoral politics. If the military situation improves, the areas where elections can be held can be increased. The above is in terms of regions. In addition, there should be no problems with elections for Mongolia, Tibet, overseas Chinese, border areas, professions, and women. Therefore, the reasons given by some people for postponing the general election are insufficient.</p>
<h3>New Mexican Ambassador, Eguiluz, Arrives in Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] External Affairs news: The new Mexican Ambassador to China, General Eguiluz, is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 24th. Ling Qihan, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Jizheng, Assistant Officer, and Carrillo, Secretary of the Mexican Embassy, will go to Xiaguan Station to greet him. The ambassador is scheduled to pay a visit to Foreign Minister Wang on the 25th, and the date for presenting his credentials is yet to be determined.</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Orders Subordinates: Officers and Soldiers Must Not Be Below Strength</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] According to the Military News Agency, the Ministry of National Defense has ordered commanders at all levels to conduct thorough inspections and strengthen combat power, emphasizing that the number of officers and soldiers in the troops is supplemented according to the establishment and that there must be no shortages or false reporting. It has also instructed commanders to pay attention to the nurturing of new recruits, break down the boundaries between officers and soldiers, improve the food for soldiers, instill political knowledge, enrich recreational and medical facilities, promote soldiers' health, and cultivate good qualities. It has also instructed supervisory officials to dispatch personnel for on-site inspections at any time.</p>
<h3>The US President Is Extremely Dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's Breach of Faith; Soviet Newspaper Criticizes the Wedemeyer Mission</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 23rd broadcast: US Congressman Sabath had a long talk with President Truman yesterday to review the international situation. It is said that the US President is extremely dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's breach of faith.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 23rd broadcast: The Soviet Navy's official newspaper "Red Fleet" published today that the US will lend 2 billion US dollars to the Chinese government and equip 20 divisions of the Chinese army. The newspaper fiercely criticized the Wedemeyer special mission, believing that the mission has made the connection between the Chinese Kuomintang and the US government even closer.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained silence on the US again protesting the Soviet Union's continued occupation of Dalian. It could not be confirmed whether the envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had discussed this matter with Foreign Minister Wang the other day. However, according to authoritative sources, the authorities are paying attention to this matter as always, and the time to reaffirm our position or take appropriate steps is not far away.</p>
<h3>Most of the Measures for Implementing Economy Have Been Drafted</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The measures for implementing the Outline of Economy and Consumption have been drafted separately by the relevant agencies, and most have been completed. The measures drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs were sent to the Executive Yuan on the 23rd, and the measures for encouraging the use of domestic goods drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs are also expected to be sent out next Monday. The implementation measures drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs include the following seven types: (1) Measures for Implementing the Movement to Strictly Observe Time (regulations on time for work, meetings, banquets, receptions, transportation, and entertainment); (2) Measures for Implementing Work Relief; (3) Measures for Establishing Vocational Training Centers; (4) Measures for Promoting the Abolition of New Year's Gifts; (5) Measures for Economizing on Gifts for Celebrations and Commemorations; (6) Measures for Economizing on Banquets (regulations on ordinary social events, receptions for foreign guests, etc.); (7) Measures for Restricting Banquets in Government Agencies and State-Owned Enterprises.</p>
<h3>Measures for Banning Dancing May Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Content Takes into Account the Actual Situation</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The implementation measures for the prohibition of commercial dance halls, as stipulated in the Outline of Economy Measures, are being drafted by the Ministry of Interior and are expected to be submitted to the Executive Yuan next Monday. According to the person in charge of the Department of Etiquette of the Ministry of Interior, who is drafting these measures, "In drafting these measures, in addition to emphasizing the application and scope of the law, we also take into account the actual social situation. Therefore, we attach great importance to the opinions of local governments. It cannot be confirmed that the Shanghai Municipal Government has exchanged views with the Ministry and provided a written opinion for the Ministry's reference. However, since Shanghai has many dance halls and people who rely on dancing for a living, the Ministry will pay attention to this when drafting the measures. As for what constitutes a 'commercial dance hall' and what steps will be taken to ban dancing, we will refer to opinions from all parties." When asked by reporters whether the report that Shanghai dance halls would use a lottery system to ban them in batches was true, he said that banning dancing would be implemented step by step.</p>
<h3>It Is Undecided Whether to Continue the Four-Bank Joint Industrial Loan; Some Influential People Advocate Stopping the Loan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] After the Four-Bank Joint Office decided to tighten lending, various parties speculated about the inside story of this decision. According to a senior staff member participating in economic decision-making who told this reporter, the decision to tighten lending is probably a sign before a major change, because the government has not yet made a final decision on this policy. Some influential people believe that the purpose of the loan is solely to increase production and stabilize prices. However, in fact, the importance of currency in modern production conditions cannot exceed raw materials, power, and technology. Therefore, if the source of raw materials is not smooth and power technology is not improved, the result of the loan is that factories not only cannot use it to increase production, but also use it for speculation and profit, resulting in increased floating capital and stimulating prices. Therefore, it is better to stop the loan. However, the general public believes that although the implementation of the loan policy in the past has not fully achieved the expected goals, many factories have been able to maintain it for many years. If the loan is stopped, some large-scale factories that rely on loans will inevitably stop operating, resulting in an increase in unemployment on the one hand and a decrease in production on the other. Therefore, the loan should continue. The dispute between the two sides is unresolved, but the former opinion seems to be dominant, and the Four-Bank Joint Office's recent decision to carefully consider loans is the result of being influenced by this opinion.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Settlement Banks Are Designated as Twelve</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] The Beiping Branch of the National Bank recently received an order to determine the twelve designated foreign exchange settlement banks in the city, including: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Trust of China, Postal Savings Bureau, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, China Industrial Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque de l'Indochine, and The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (not yet reopened). Citibank does not do business with the public, and HSBC reportedly did not meet the conditions when Fu Chu applied, so they were not included.</p>
<h3>The Agreement Between Us and the Hong Kong Government Is Extremely Extensive</h3>
<p>Announcement Date Delayed Due to Reasons</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The economic and financial agreement between us and the Hong Kong government, which has been negotiated for several months, includes a wide range of issues, such as anti-smuggling, taxation, exchange, and crackdown on the black market. It was signed in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month by Shao Zenghua, the representative of our Central Bank, and Ross, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong. Zhang Jia'ao, the Governor of the Central Bank, has brought the full text of this agreement to the government in Nanjing yesterday. Our government and the Hong Kong government originally scheduled to announce it simultaneously on the 23rd. According to sources, since the British government announced new economic measures at midnight on the 20th of this month and suspended the acceptance of US dollars in pound sterling, the exchange rate and several related issues in this agreement have yet to be resolved. Therefore, the announcement date must be delayed.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices in Nanchang Plunge</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] Grain prices here are now plunging, led by new grain. The evening price of late rice was 87,000 (down by over 10,000 yuan), and new rice could be traded at 150,000.</p>
<h3>The Governor of Hong Kong and His Wife Will Visit Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] The Hong Kong Information Office announced that the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Grantham and his wife, are scheduled to visit Guangzhou on the 27th.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Reporter Identity Can Be Decided in the Short Term</h3>
<p>Gu Zhengkang's Reply to the Capital Press</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Liu Qirui, Xu Junwu, Deng Jixing, and three other directors of the Capital News Reporters Association, went to the Ministry of Social Affairs this afternoon on behalf of the Association to state their views on the issue of determining the identity of reporters, and were personally received by Minister Gu Zhengkang. Liu and others stated that the status of journalists is extremely high, and in free occupations, they have a direct influence on guiding society to advance democracy. As the general election is approaching, the government should promptly determine the identity of reporters, in order to prevent abuse and avoid disputes, and set an example for democratic politics. Minister Gu replied that the Ministry of Social Affairs believes that the issue of determining the identity of reporters is extremely urgent. The Vocational Group Election Office has already paid attention to it and is currently exchanging views with the Ministry of Interior.

<h3>The Authorities Are Considering Revising the Entire Set of Measures for Gold Notes and Treasury Bonds; Zhang Jia'ao Denies the Saying That Gold Is Nationalized</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun said on the 23rd that the gold issue is being discussed by the All-Economic Council, and the issue of handling US treasury bonds is being studied by the Ministry of Finance. He categorically declined to comment on the reform of the currency system.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Following the revision of the foreign exchange control measures, in order to cooperate with the implementation of these measures, the government is considering formulating, in the future, it may refer to the US black market, first stipulate a certain ratio between the US dollar and gold, and then according to this ratio, determine the daily legal tender price of gold based on the daily foreign exchange market price in China. However, the nature of this measure is not equivalent to a complete opening of the gold market, because gold transactions in the future will still be limited to the people and the national bank, or its designated banks. (2) The decision to stop selling US treasury bonds allows the issue of how to repay the already sold portion, but the relevant parties still have disputes. One group of people advocates repaying according to the foreign exchange market price to maintain the government's credibility, while another group believes that if repaid at the market price, the country's losses would be too great, and it would be better to give up higher interest rates when repaying. (3) Except for the unfinished part of the barter debt repayment by the Resources Committee and the determined purchase part of the spring silkworm loan, the rest of the export goods will be stopped from being purchased, and all subsidies will be stopped.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] Governor of the Central Bank Zhang Jia'ao met with this agency's reporter alone on the 23rd and stated that the Chinese government has no intention of nationalizing gold or forcing the people to sell gold to the government at the open market price. The rumors about this matter in recent days are all unfounded. Zhang also revealed that the authorities are studying issues related to short-term US treasury bonds and believe that a satisfactory solution will be found soon. When Zhang spoke about speculators raising the prices of export commodities after the government promulgated the new foreign exchange regulations, he hinted that the government might take action to stop them. However, Zhang then presented a price list of China's main export commodities, showing that the prices of various items have only increased slightly since the new foreign exchange regulations were promulgated. He believes that China can continue to import urgently needed food and fuel to stabilize the people's lives without harming the progress of China's industrial recovery work. Zhang said that the limit of a maximum of 100 US dollars carried by travelers entering and leaving China is based on international customs rules.</p>
<h3>The Center of US Trade in the Far East May Be Replaced by Shanghai in Tokyo; US Industrialists Will Invest Heavily in Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] After Japan resumed foreign trade, several American industrialists who recently arrived in Japan were ordered to specifically investigate the possibility of making Tokyo the center of their company's Far East trade. They told a Central News Agency reporter separately that the hope of making Shanghai the center of their company's Far East trade has almost vanished. Macau, Tokyo, and Hong Kong are expected to rise up and replace them as the main ports for their Far East trade, and said that because the Hong Kong government's control over trade is increasing day by day, the importance of Hong Kong is also gradually disappearing. They specifically pointed out that although Macau is a notorious gambling den on the coast of South China, they believe that it is the back door for our country to import foreign goods, so its status has become suddenly important. They continued that shortly after Japan's surrender, their company transported a batch of goods to Shanghai, and has not continued to transport goods to our country in the past six months. They believe that Tokyo is the "possible clearing station" for the Far East, and finished products manufactured in Tokyo or other cities in Japan with American capital can be supplied to the Far East market at low prices. However, they are not yet sure whether the situation in Japan after the occupation will allow the realization of this plan. But in any case, this may have been determined and cannot be changed, that is, the vision of several American companies has gradually shifted from Shanghai to Tokyo, regarding it as the center of Far East trade, and are preparing to invest heavily in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Declares That There Can Be a Trade Surplus After Three Years</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani Chozaburo replied to a question from the Commerce Committee of the House of Councillors yesterday, saying that Japan's trade can have a surplus after three years, but this depends on whether the plan set by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to produce 15 million tons of coal annually for the next three years can be realized.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] According to the figures released by the Hong Kong Immigration Department, Japanese goods have gradually become active in the Hong Kong market, in addition to American goods maintaining the top spot. The import value of American goods last month was over 28.568 million yuan, and the value of American goods shipped out was over 4.899 million yuan. In the first seven months of this year, the import of American goods was 169.52 million yuan, and the export in the same period was 80.287 million yuan, with an import surplus of 89 million yuan. The import from Japan last month was 5.068 million yuan, and the import from Japan in the past seven months was 88.465 million yuan, with an import surplus of 7.7 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Canberra, 23rd] The Australian government has ordered the resumption of private trade with Japan, but permits will only be issued when satisfactory financial regulations have been established to conduct trade between Japan and the Sterling Area. The Allied occupation authorities in Japan still control private trade and do not allow any contracts to be concluded before September 1. However, Australian merchants who had contractual relations with Japan before the war have been allowed to conduct business activities and negotiate new contracts.</p>
<p>There Is Still No Perfect Countermeasure for the Problem of Smuggling Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Wu Yun Chu Told Reporters</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the selection of industrial representatives for the business delegation to Japan, according to Wu Yun Chu, letters have been sent to the branch offices of the Industrial Association in various places to solicit opinions and ask them to send the list of selected representatives to Shanghai. It is expected that all representatives can be produced within two weeks. Wu himself said that he is not familiar with business and is unwilling to go to Japan. He also said that as a result of the industry and commerce representatives going to Beijing several times, the government has respected public opinion, and all commodities that can be produced domestically and in Taiwan are not intended to be imported from Japan. On the contrary, Japanese raw materials that are useful to us, such as rayon, sulfur, and copper, are all on the list of imports. Japanese machine parts are useful for the factories we have received, so they should be allowed to be imported. The smuggling of Japanese goods will be a major problem in the future, but so far there is no perfect countermeasure. American people believe that Japan today is also a country with high wages, so the competition of Japanese goods is not to be feared. In fact, compared with China, Japanese wages are far lower. According to news from the textile industry in Shanghai, the wages of our textile workers are actually eight times higher than those of Japanese workers, and it is impossible to compete.</p>

The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards the Sanjian River, appearing to be attacking Gushi. This time, Liu's bandits fled from western Shandong to southern Henan, originally intending to jump out of the National Army's encirclement to avoid annihilation and solve the problem of food supply. However, they were pursued and intercepted by the National Army along the way. The bandits fought during the day and had to break through and flee at night, averaging one meal every two days.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Farewell to Special Envoy Wedemeyer</h3>
<p>General Wedemeyer, by order of President Truman, led a fact-finding mission to China to investigate the actual political, economic, and military situation in our country. The mission has been completed and is scheduled to leave China this morning to fly to Tokyo. General Wedemeyer arrived in our capital from Guam at 5:00 p.m. on July 22 and immediately began his investigation work. He traveled extensively in the summer heat, taking pains to personally go to Ping, Shen, Qing, Hu, Taiwan, Guangzhou and other places to "seek facts," meet with people from all walks of life, and conduct extensive consultations. It has been just one month since then, and he is already embarking on a journey to fly to Korea. We cannot help but express our regret at the departure of this "friend of China." In particular, General Wedemeyer's candid advice is worth our country's reflection and self-reflection.</p>
<p>After General Wedemeyer leaves China and returns to his country, he will certainly prepare a report on his observations of China's political situation and submit it to President Truman as the basis for the United States to adopt a new policy toward China. The content of the report is currently unknown, and we do not want to speculate arbitrarily. However, on the eve of General Wei's departure from China, he attended a symposium at the chairman's residence and frankly criticized China's current situation to our Central Health Bureau. According to reports from various sources, the general meaning can be summarized as follows: Everything in China is extremely promising, but unfortunately, nothing can achieve the expected results. The crux of the problem is "poor human planning" and incomplete utilization of human resources. (1) Politics: Although the government has made some progress in recruiting talent and improving administrative efficiency, it is still insufficient. It is hoped that the government can accept free criticism from all parties, eliminate corrupt officials, and prohibit civil servants from engaging in business. (2) Economy: China has abundant resources and ample wealth, but unfortunately, it has not yet been developed, resulting in goods being discarded on the ground and wealth hidden in "self." The total amount of private Chinese assets in the United States is quite large. If they can be well managed and used properly, it will be enough to promote China's economic development. (3) Military Affairs: The treatment of soldiers is too low and must be improved as soon as possible so that officers and soldiers can share weal and woe. In order to save military expenses, it is especially necessary to adopt a policy of elite troops. (4) Communist Bandit Problem: The government must not regard the Communist bandit problem as a purely military problem. In addition to military affairs, political forces are also needed, and improving people's lives is of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are indeed worth our country's introspection. General Wei's frank and sincere attitude is especially praiseworthy. The Chinese people have always held a philosophical view of "treating people with sincerity" in the way of making friends, and "words of loyalty and trustworthiness" is the beginning of establishing sincerity. As the saying goes, "Cultivate words to establish their sincerity." In addition to humbly accepting General Wei's kindness, we would also like to offer some slightly different perspectives for reference by General Wei and our general American allies.</p>
<p>First, Special Envoy Wedemeyer spent a month in China, traveling tirelessly from Beijing and Shanghai to North China, from North China to the Northeast, and then from Beijing to Taiwan and South China. He was tireless and his enthusiasm is admirable. However, we do not know how many credible facts Special Envoy Wei actually sought in various places, and not entirely the same as hearsay? Yesterday, various newspapers disclosed a memorandum jointly submitted to Special Envoy Wei by some people from all walks of life in Shanghai, which could not help but remind us that Special Envoy Wei came to Shanghai three times, and why did he never seek to meet with and exchange opinions with the responsible persons of the Shanghai local groups, industrial and commercial education groups? In terms of humbly seeking information and conducting thorough investigations, there are some regrets. What's more, we have heard that the people Special Envoy Wei met were mostly pre-arranged by his subordinates, as long as they had opinions different from the government, no matter what their social status, reputation, or the value of their opinions, they had priority for interviews. If so, we are deeply afraid that his "hearsay" will not only be unhelpful to Sino-U.S. relations, but also to the overall world situation.</p>
<p>Second, we completely agree in principle with Special Envoy Wedemeyer's advice to the Chinese government to reform itself voluntarily. We believe that China needs reform in politics, economy, and military affairs, and without reform, it may not be able to extricate itself. However, we also believe that after eight years of war, China has suffered greatly and is like a patient just recovering from a serious illness. It can only recover slowly. If we want to talk about thorough and drastic reforms, it is not something that can be done urgently. China has a history of four or five thousand years, and the traditional concepts of the people and the social customs do not allow China to reform completely immediately. The national characters of China and the United States are not entirely the same, and Americans sometimes have a somewhat subjective view of China's political situation. The reason why some people in the United States cannot deeply understand China's politics is also because of this. Therefore, we hope that when Special Envoy Wei investigates China's political situation, he should pay special attention to the essence of Chinese culture and the stage of China's evolution, and never use American standards to measure China's current politics.</p>
<p>Third, we want the Chinese and American people to pay special attention to the history of friendship between the two countries. The foundation of Sino-U.S. relations can be said to have been laid after the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. At that time, the theory of "partitioning" was rampant, and China's situation was precarious. Fortunately, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay issued a statement in 1902, proposing the Open Door Policy, which broke the sphere of influence and turned the crisis into safety. Since then, the Chinese people have realized that the United States has no ambition to territorially aggress China. Until the "September 18th" Incident, Stimson's non-recognition doctrine deepened the friendship between China and the United States. During this war, Sino-U.S. relations underwent another baptism of blood and became friends in need, and the great achievements of U.S. President Roosevelt at the Yalta Conference made us never forget it. We believe that the close relationship between China and the United States has a long history of development and cannot be exchanged for any material price. All Chinese and American people should especially cherish and love each other, and should not allow this extraordinary friendship to be diminished due to temporary commercial interests. However, unfortunately, there is a small group of people in China who are trying their best to alienate the deep friendship between China and the United States, thinking that there is room for him to use one country against another for own benefits. We call on Special Envoy Wedemeyer and our American allies to pay attention to this, for the sake of the overall world situation and for the sake of long-term peace, never be fooled by this!</p>
<p>Fourth, we would also like to point out that there are also a few people in the United States who advocate supporting Japan and want to regard Japan as the stabilizing force in the Far East in the future. This view not only runs counter to the wartime U.S. view of China as the stabilizing force in the Far East in theory, but is also practically impossible. At the beginning of the 20th century, did Britain not form an alliance with Japan, and how did Japan repay Britain? Before the Anti-Japanese War, did China not want to be friends with Japan, and how did Japan repay China? Can Japan have integrity in the future? It is still unknown. Japan verbally said friendship, but its intention was to invade, which eventually led to the Second World War. This historical lesson is worth the attention of the U.S. authorities. Is the superficial respect of the Japanese people a sincere and willing surrender of the Japanese people to the United States? "A gentleman can be deceived by his proper way." Special Envoy Wei is flying to Tokyo this morning, and we wonder what his feelings will be.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to reiterate that the Chinese people are extremely willing to maintain friendly relations with the United States at all times, and whether the United States actually provides aid to China is something that the United States should consider itself. The Chinese people do not care about this, because we deeply know the way of "self-reliance." Under the premise of not harming China's sovereignty and national character, any suggestions made by Special Envoy Wedemeyer or any advice given by the United States is welcome by us. On the contrary, the Chinese people will never want to see the government damage its sovereignty and destroy its national character in order to seek American aid. This is China's style and the integrity of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Resources Commission Actively Plans to Rebuild Power Equipment in Hunan and Guangxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The power equipment in Hunan and Guangxi provinces has been severely damaged since the Hunan-Guangxi Campaign in the 33rd year of the Republic, and the Resources Commission is currently planning to rebuild it. In Changsha, the pre-war power generation capacity was 10,000 kilowatts, but the equipment was almost completely lost during the restoration. A 1,000-kilowatt generator has been purchased from the Materials Supply Bureau and was installed on the 13th of this month and can be officially supplied with electricity. In addition, several generators allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will be distributed in Changsha with a 2,500-kilowatt generator. Some of the equipment has already arrived. After power generation, the total available power capacity will reach 3,500 kilowatts. However, the local market is prosperous, and this capacity is still insufficient. The committee has ordered a 5,000-kilowatt generator from the United States to supplement it. The large-scale motors needed for the Xiangtan industrial zone must wait until the implementation of the Japanese compensation case before they can be realized. However, two 1,000-kilowatt generators from UNRRA have already been allocated, and all the equipment has been transported and the installation has actively begun. As for Liuzhou, since the 500-kilowatt new generator at the Liuzhou power plant began supplying electricity in July of this year, the market has also become more prosperous. The plant is now repairing the original 2,000-kilowatt generator and started a test run on the 8th of this month. After that, there should be no shortage of electricity in Liuzhou. In addition, the committee recently received a telegram from the Jibei Power Company stating that the company's 500-kilowatt generator in the Zhangjiakou power plant has also officially started supplying electricity and the situation is good.</p>

<h3>Pakistan Should be a Natural Member of the United Nations, Argentina Submits a Motion to the Secretariat</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] Argentina submitted a motion to the United Nations Secretariat today requesting that the issue of recognizing Pakistan as a natural member of the United Nations be included in the supplementary agenda of the next United Nations General Assembly. The note pointed out that "the whole of India was a founding member of the United Nations, having signed the Declaration of January 1, 1942, and Pakistan and the Federation of India are the result of the division of this whole of India. There is no need to apply for membership as a new member. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly should declare that both the Federation of India and Pakistan are natural members of the United Nations." According to the Argentine Ambassador, he strongly opposes the fact that the United Nations organization changed the Indian flag to the flag of the Federation of India without adding the Pakistani flag to the array of United Nations flags. He will present Argentina's views in the Political Committee of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Security Council Discusses Anglo-Egyptian Dispute, Egypt Opposes Direct Negotiations, A Disturbance Occurs in the Spectator Gallery</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] In the Security Council chamber today, United Nations guards twice stopped disturbances by Egyptian spectators. First, a young man with a beard wearing a red Turkish fez was dragged out of the chamber by two guards. Then, an Egyptian man stood up in the spectator gallery and shouted slogans such as "Freedom or the death of international peace, death to the Security Council," "Down with imperialism," and "Long live the Nile Valley." This person was also escorted out of the chamber by the guards.</p>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch] After order was restored, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy stood up and spoke, firmly opposing the Brazilian proposal that Britain and Egypt resume direct negotiations, and firmly stated that the Egyptian government is determined to protect Sudan from separation. He also declared that if the Security Council adopts the Brazilian resolution, it will not eliminate the existing threats to peace, and Egypt may have to submit another appeal to the Security Council. Nokrashy welcomed the amendment proposed by the Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu, which added the words "the British government has already partially withdrawn its troops stationed in Egypt and is preparing to negotiate a complete withdrawal" to the Brazilian resolution. He also said that the Brazilian resolution did not specifically mention the end of British rule in Sudan. He pointed out that the territorial integrity of Sudan has been threatened, so he must reiterate that the Egyptian government is determined to protect Sudan from disintegration and enable the Sudanese people to manage their affairs under an organization united with Egypt. Nokrashy finally stated that the Egyptian government believes that the Brazilian resolution is intended to evade the primary responsibility that the Security Council should bear.</p>
<h3>Australia Formally Requests the General Assembly to Review the Veto System</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] Australia, which is most strongly opposed to the system of powerful countries exercising the veto power in the Security Council, formally requested today that a motion to "re-examine the resolution established by the previous General Assembly on the issue of the veto power" be included in the supplementary agenda of the next United Nations General Assembly. Australia also requested that the General Assembly examine to what extent the proposals contained in the resolutions of the previous General Assembly have been implemented. It is expected that the small countries' criticism of the veto system will be a tense scene in the next United Nations General Assembly, which will begin on September 16. Argentina believes that the inconsistent voting method, namely the veto power, should be abolished, and requests that a special committee discuss how to change this regulation.</p>
<h3>United Nations Agency Decides to Continue Intervening in the Indo-Dutch Dispute, But Opinions on the Method of Intervention Still Differ</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] The United Nations seems to have decided to continue intervening in the Indo-Dutch dispute, although opinions on the method of intervention still differ. However, it is generally agreed that the Security Council can decide on the method of intervention on Monday or Tuesday, at the very least organizing a monitoring group of the eleven countries of the Security Council to investigate the extent to which the United Nations truce order is being complied with.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 23rd] Soviet Representative Gromyko criticized the proposal made by China and Australia in the Security Council today to order the consuls stationed in Batavia to report to the Security Council on the current situation in Indonesia. He believed that the Security Council could not trust the opinions and actions of the consuls of the three countries, Britain, France, and the United States, stationed in Batavia, because the positions taken by Britain, France, and the United States on the Indonesian issue were all favorable to the Netherlands, and the joint proposal made by China and Australia in this regard was suspected of circumventing the United Nations organization. If the Security Council wants to deal with this issue, it must establish two committees, one to supervise the recent truce order and one to implement arbitration, or establish a single committee with the functions of the previous two. The Security Council must act quickly, and these two committees or one committee must be composed of Security Council member countries, and the number of its members may be less than eleven, but they must be representatives of the Security Council member countries. Prior to that, Gromyko also rejected a resolution proposed by US Representative Johnson, which suggested that the Security Council make mediation suggestions to the parties to the dispute to help resolve the dispute peacefully. In order to carry out this assistance task, the Security Council should establish a three-member committee, in which two members are selected by the parties to the dispute from the members of the Security Council, and the remaining one member is selected by the former two selected members from the members of the Security Council. Dutch Representative Kleffens attended the meeting and warned the Security Council that what the Security Council could do and has done is beneficial to extremist elements. He reiterated that the Netherlands does not recognize the Security Council's right to deal with this "internal matter that does not threaten international peace."</p>
<h3>International Trade Conference Discusses the Contents of the Draft Trade Charter</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 22nd] Jin Wensi, the head of the Chinese delegation, expressed his frank opinion on the draft international trade charter while discussing it at the International Trade Conference here today. He said: Although it is good to maintain a broad basis for the charter to accommodate various opinions, he found it difficult to understand why some existing trade barriers were still tolerated, since all other restrictive measures of a similar nature had already been prohibited. Jin said that after describing China's loss of balance in its international payments and the failure of its economic recovery plan to be implemented, "China hopes to have the opportunity to study more closely some provisions in the charter that will not alleviate but will increase China's current difficulties." According to reports, Jin will speak at the plenary session of the preparatory committee for the Havana World Trade Conference in November this year. The draft trade charter must be approved by the plenary session of the preparatory committee before it is submitted to the Havana Conference.</p>

<h3>Japan to Adopt Dumping Policy to Compete for Foreign Markets</h3>
<p>Foreign Merchants Believe Japanese Goods are of Poor Quality</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] In order to compete for foreign trade, the Japanese government will not adopt a controlled price system for exports, and has decided to set up a committee within the price bureau that specializes in determining the prices of exports. This committee will have the right to determine exceptional selling prices for the purpose of promoting certain exports. In other words, the committee will have the right to determine the dumping price for exports, regardless of their cost.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Foreign business representatives who have arrived in Japan have begun trading in various places, and have mostly criticized Japanese goods for their outdated and unpopular styles, poor quality, and high prices, and believe that improvements are needed. They hope to meet directly with manufacturers to enable them to produce goods that can be sold in the world market.</p>
<h3>Britain, the United States, and France Meet in London to Discuss Germany's Industrial Level, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Formally Request to be Provided with Meeting Information</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Representatives from Britain, the United States, and France began secret meetings here today to discuss the previous decision by Britain and the United States to raise the level of German industry, especially steel production. The meeting place is Lancaster Hall, where the representatives of the four foreign ministers discussed the German-Austrian peace treaty this spring.</p>
<p>Judging from the initial signs of the meeting, the situation of the daily meetings thereafter will be kept secret. Today's initial meeting likely only discussed the procedural issues of the meeting. According to people close to the three delegations, the topics discussed today included: (1) the way the news of the meeting is disseminated externally; (2) the discussion of the requirements of other relevant countries to provide information on the meeting; (3) the order of discussion of the items on the agenda. The meeting is expected to last no more than a few days, and the way it publishes news to the outside world is expected to be to issue a short communique after the first meeting, and then issue a final communique at the end of the meeting. According to very reliable sources, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have formally requested that the results of the London talks be made known to them, and the Netherlands has also requested that no final decision on Germany's industrial level be made before its opinions have been sought. This request is expected to be discussed at today's first meeting. It is heard that the British delegation is expected to support the requests of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to provide information. According to the Potsdam Conference, the German steel industry was set at an annual production level of 5.8 million tons, but the actual production in 1946 was only 2.5 million tons. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov expressed his intention at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to raise it to an annual production of 10 million to 13 million tons, and the provisional target agreed upon by Generals Clay and Robertson in July this year is said to be 11.5 million tons.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Seoul, 22nd] The Soviet delegation to the US-Soviet Joint Commission today held a reception for reporters in Seoul, accusing North Korea of destroying left-wing newspapers and arresting staff and groups, which hindered the work of the US-Soviet Joint Commission in establishing a temporary Korean government.

Major General Brown, Director of the US delegation, said afterwards that the Soviet delegation was attempting to interfere in the work of the South Korean government in Korea, and that it was not the task of the Joint Commission to govern Korea.</p>

<h3>Movie Theater Strike Breaks Out: Over Ten Theaters Stop Selling Tickets; Morning Shows on Sunday Unlikely to Open; Social Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Convene Labor and Management Today for Mediation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the Meiqi Grand Theater's staff objecting to the agreement and failing to prioritize the employment of unemployed members of the union, workers began a slowdown starting at 1:30 PM yesterday. Upon hearing the news, workers at other theaters responded one after another, and by evening, over ten theaters, including Da Guangming, Nanjing, Hu Guang, Guotai, Carlton, Da Hua, Jinmen, Lido, Jin Du, Paris, Queen, and Xin Guang, were caught in the whirlpool. Other theaters remained open as usual. To prevent the situation from escalating, the Social Affairs Bureau urgently dispatched personnel late at night to the union to persuade them, and scheduled a negotiation between labor and management for this morning. It is unlikely that the aforementioned theaters will be able to open their Sunday morning shows. Whether or not the afternoon shows will be screened will depend on the outcome of this morning's negotiations. Those who went on strike yesterday were members of the Second Branch of the Movie Theater Workers' Union, including ticket sellers, ticket checkers, ticket takers, and errand boys. The workers of the First Branch (projection room) continued to work as usual.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the labor and management of the movie theater industry signed a written record stipulating that each theater should prioritize hiring unemployed members of the union when adding staff. Recently, three White Russian female ticket takers at the Meiqi Grand Theater returned to their country, and the theater hired three local girls to replace them from outside. The union wrote to the Social Affairs Bureau, accusing the theater of violating the agreement. Before the Social Affairs Bureau could convene labor and management for mediation after receiving the report, the workers of the Meiqi Grand Theater launched a slowdown at 1:30 PM yesterday. The tickets for the first show had already been sold, and it was screened as usual. The performance was stopped from the second show onward. After the news spread, other movie theaters responded one after another, and the union sent out "pickets" to various theaters. By the evening, over ten theaters, including Da Guangming, which were caught in the whirlpool, had also stopped selling tickets, but the movies were still being shown as usual, and those who had already purchased tickets could still watch them. Only Meiqi, Jinmen, and Da Hua were completely shut down. Upon hearing the news, the various district patrol bureaus dispatched a large number of officers to maintain order in the theaters. There was a slight dispute in front of the Xin Guang Theater, but fortunately, nothing serious happened.</p>
<p>Personnel Sent to Persuade; No Results</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Fan Zhenbang, Chief of the Mediation Section, seeing that the situation was gradually deteriorating and might affect all movie theaters in the city, urgently dispatched Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Chief of the Mediation Section, and Zhu Guilin to the Second Branch of the Union late at night to persuade them. At that time, workers from various theaters who had participated in the slowdown were gathered there. Deputy Chief Gu began to persuade them, telling them that while it was inappropriate for the Meiqi Theater to violate the agreement, the workers' rash action was also inconsiderate. If the employer violated the agreement, the labor side could report it to the Social Affairs Bureau, which would convene mediation. If the employer still repeatedly refused to attend the negotiations or ignored the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation, the Social Affairs Bureau could file a lawsuit with the court to enforce it. The most serious administrative punishment would be to revoke its business license. Now the workers' report claimed that the Meiqi Grand Theater had violated the agreement, and the Social Affairs Bureau had not yet convened mediation when the workers took this action, which also affected other movie theaters that had not violated the labor-management agreement. Their actions really needed to be corrected. The persuasion did not end until 11:00 PM, and they telegraphed Director Shen and Chief Fan about the situation. In order to prevent the situation from escalating, even though today is Sunday, labor and management will still be convened for mediation to find a solution.</p>
<p>In addition, the Movie Theater Business Association is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on this day to discuss countermeasures. The chairman of the association, Liang Qitian, is the person in charge of the Meiqi Grand Theater.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Huo Baoshu, Director of the Administrative Relief Department, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing after reporting on his duties, he has remained silent about the case of the department's Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and six other senior officials being accused of corruption, and is waiting for the investigation by the Supervisory Envoy's Office and the court. Yesterday, neither the District Prosecutor's Office nor the Supervisory Envoy's Office sent anyone to the department to investigate.</p>
<p>Because there were rumors that Jiang Tingfu, the former Director of the Administrative Relief Department, would rush back to Shanghai from the United States on the 28th of this month to mediate the internal disputes of the Administrative Relief Department, the reporter visited several senior officials of the Administrative Relief Department who were relatively close to Jiang to inquire, and all replied that they did not know anything about it. However, according to them, Jiang is currently the acting representative of my country to the United Nations Security Council, and his position is extremely important. He will not be able to return to the country until Guo Taiqi, the official representative of our country to the council, has fully recovered his health. However, they said that someone in the Administrative Relief Department had indeed telegraphed Jiang to return to the country for a trip.</p>

<h3>Wang Xifan Re-tried for Allegedly Manufacturing Military Cloth for the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Xifan's case of suspected traitor was tried in the High Court yesterday. Wang was accused of raising funds to organize the Yuantong Cloth Factory before the war. During the period of the fall, he cooperated with the enemy's Gongda Yarn Factory to change Yuantong into a Yida Dyeing Factory. He served as the chairman of the factory and used the power of the enemy and puppets to successively occupy more than 100 acres of nearby people's land. He colluded with the Japanese factory director Takao Naoshi and Inoue Mitsujiro to extract materials and manufacture military cloth. After the victory, the Yida Factory was taken over by the China Textile Company and renamed the Sixth China Textile Factory. Subsequently, nine workers of the factory, including Wu Shenhu, jointly reported the case, and the High Prosecutor's Office filed a lawsuit. The focus of yesterday's trial was whether Wang colluded with the Japanese, and whether his severance fee of 1.5 million yuan when Yida Factory was dissolved was paid by Wang.

<h3>Highway Robbers on Qinghu Road: Investigation Shows They Were Remnants of the Former New Fourth Army; The Wounded American is Not Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A gang of bandits robbed a car on Qinghu Road on the morning of the 21st and shot an American. The details have been recorded in yesterday's communications section of this newspaper. Since the incident, the security authorities in charge of security in this city have attached great importance to it. Yesterday, Tao Gengrong, chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Bureau's Criminal Investigation Section, and staff member Xu Guoji and others went to the scene to investigate. The robbed vehicle was a small jeep owned by the US Navy Office, with the vehicle number 12811. The injured American was George Lawton, an employee of the office. He is currently being treated at the US Naval Hospital. It is reported that his injuries are not serious and he will be discharged from the hospital in about a week.</p>
<p>According to George, he and his colleague Pan Lai and two girlfriends drove a Navy Jeep to Sheshan for fun that day. When they returned after enjoying themselves, it was already 12:00 late at night. When the car passed the Fangjiayao area of the 15th Bridge on Qinghu Road (under the jurisdiction of Qingpu County), more than a dozen bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Half of them were wearing grass green uniforms and held guns, ordering the car to stop. George and others did not pay attention at first, so they accelerated forward, which angered the bandits. They opened fire, and a bullet hit George in the buttocks. He eventually lost his driving ability due to his injuries and crashed into the rice fields on the side of the road. The bandits took the opportunity to surround them and beat George and Pan Lai with gun handles. Several bandits began to loot, taking more than 300,000 yuan in legal tender, a string of keys, and a lighter. At this time, a truck full of fishmongers happened to pass by. The bandits abandoned the car and rushed to the middle of the road to intercept and rob the truck. It took a long time. After that, they robbed another truck in the same way. Until 6:00 in the morning, because they saw a military vehicle driving from Shanghai, the bandits fled in all directions. Because the wheels of George and others' car were stuck in the mud, they could not start. They were helped by passers-by to push the car to the road, and Pan Lai drove back to Shanghai. He immediately sent the injured person to the Naval Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the authorities. Yesterday, the US Naval Hospital sent the bullet taken from George's buttocks to the police station for inspection. According to the police investigation, it was learned that this gang of bandits was the remnants of the former New Fourth Army Gu Fusheng, with a number of about 70 or 80 people, owning more than ten rifles and three pistols, and usually appeared in the Huangbo Jiwang Temple area, causing great harm. However, because the area is under the jurisdiction of Qingpu County, it is necessary to wait for instructions from the highest security authority in this city before jointly going to search and suppress them.</p>
<h3>Fu Bo Case Compensation Issues: A Solution Has Been Negotiated</h3>
<p>The families of the officers who died in the Fu Bo incident previously requested relief from the China Merchants Bureau and the issuance of compensation because of their difficult lives.

It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications has negotiated a solution with the Ministry of National Defense and will notify the families to go to Nanjing to personally explain the situation. The China Merchants Bureau will notify the families as soon as the official documents arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>House Seized as National Property: Ma Jiayong Accuses Wu Rencang</h3>
<p>Wu Rencang, Director of the Central Trust Bureau and Secretary-General of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee, was recently accused by Ma Jiayong, the owner of the Shanghai Peichang Iron Factory, of "infringing on private rights" based on a judgment example of the Administrative Court. Ma Jiayong purchased the base house at No. 1, Alley 84, Xiangde Road from Japanese Nishimura on October 2, 1943. The deed was Japanese Registration No. 1352 (originally American Registration No. 3920). After the victory, the house was allocated for military use. Ma recently applied to the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office for return. After investigation, the Japanese Registration deed number in the document submitted by him was 1307, which did not match the original number. Wu Rencang, Secretary-General of the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee, approved the rejection, and the house was confiscated as national property. Ma believes that the land was legally purchased and there is sufficient evidence to prove it, so he specially hired a lawyer to file a complaint against Wu Rencang, the legal representative of the committee, based on the judgment example of the Administrative Court. The case was heard yesterday by Zhao Yinglu, judge of the Civil Court of the District Court. After a long interrogation in court, the case was adjourned for retrial.</p>

This was discovered by the team and sent to the City Police Bureau for transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Paimen directly admitted to the prosecutor's question about embezzling kerosene and wood. He said that it was difficult to buy kerosene outside, so he took some home for use. The kerosene has been used up, and there are still ten gallons left. The wood was used to repair his own kitchen. I filled out the export permit myself, because the Secretary-General has this power. After the interrogation, the court ordered him to be remanded.</p>

<h3>Suddenly a Violent Guest Arrived During a Banquet for Relatives and Friends: Gold Bracelet Snatched, Young Girl Shot</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Feng Pu (25 years old), No. 108, Cihou Nanli, Hadong Road, specializes in wholesale cold noodles. Last night at about 8:00, he held a ghost festival ancestor worship and set up several tables for guests, and many relatives and friends arrived. Because the weather was hot, two tables were set up inside the house. Among the guests were nieces Pu Guidi and Pu Xinnv. Guidi is a dancer in a dance hall, with modern clothes and wearing two gold bracelets. While drinking and chatting, two bandits suddenly came, one wearing a xiangyun gauze shirt and trousers, and the other wearing a white shirt and trousers, both armed with guns. Seeing that Guidi was wearing gold bracelets, they pointed their guns at her chest and snatched the two bracelets. Her younger sister, Xinnv, screamed "robbery", which angered the bandits. They fired a shot, hitting her right neck and penetrating her left neck, and she fell to the ground. The bandits then fled with the stolen goods towards Fuxu Road, Zhongzheng Road. Upon receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately sent the injured person to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

<h3>Investigation of Corruption and Extortion by Tax Officials; Millions Demanded; Direct Taxation Bureau Thoroughly Investigating Allegations Against Woodworking Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Song Yimin and Ding Shenxiu, auditors from the Direct Taxation Bureau, went to Jin Yuan Cotton Cloth Store at No. 3 Shunshou Lane, South Wuxi Road, on the morning of the day before yesterday to examine the store's accounts. They accused the store of operating an illegal money exchange and evading taxes, intending to take all of the store's account books back to the bureau for review. At that time, Ding Shenxiu interjected, urging the store to "be sensible," and also mentioned why the previously issued business registration certificate had not yet been processed. This, he said, was already a significant favor. Song then took the opportunity to extort a bribe of ten million yuan, while Ding mediated, and they finally agreed on five million yuan. Zhao Erkang, the assistant manager of the store, paid the bribe at that time and invited them to lunch. Fang Qingcai, the store's manager, happened to return from outside and witnessed this scene. Realizing it was extortion, he was furious and called the police, who arrested Song and took him to the police station. The other investigator, Ding Shenxiu, seeing the situation was unfavorable, managed to escape.</p>
<p>"Another Report" City Councilor Pan Gongzhan, at a meeting in Beijing the day before yesterday, criticized the extortion by tax officials from the City Direct Taxation Bureau. Yesterday, Lou Guowei, the director of the Direct Taxation Bureau, stated: On the afternoon of the 21st of this month, Yan Esheng, the secretary-general of the City Chamber of Commerce, had informed him that auditors targeting the Chinese-style woodworking industry were making "conditional demands" to three businesses and asked him to pay attention. Since it was already past office hours, an investigation was launched by the Supervision Office on the 22nd. Lou also said: Out of more than a thousand people in the entire bureau, it cannot be guaranteed that everyone is honest and self-disciplined. However, once any corrupt behavior is discovered, the bureau will hand the case over to the judicial authorities for legal action. As for the fourteen auditors (two for each business) who audited the account books of seven Chinese-style woodworking businesses, the bureau has already reconfirmed the original guarantees with the guarantors. If any illegal activities are discovered through investigation, they will be handled according to the law. When asked by the reporter when the senior officials sent by the Ministry of Finance would arrive in Shanghai, Lou replied that he had only seen it in the newspaper and the bureau had not yet received any notification. However, the bureau is currently conducting a thorough investigation and hopes that Chairman Zhang Zhongyuan of the woodworking industry will provide leads to facilitate the investigation. If such situations are discovered, they will be dealt with according to the law. Otherwise, the salaries of public servants are already so meager that they cannot withstand further stimulation.</p>

<h3>Main Culprit in Li Zao Kidnapping Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Last year, in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, Shi Zhang, a woman from a prominent family in Li Zao, Pudong, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits, who demanded a large ransom. The 8th Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters managed to rescue the hostage on the spot and arrested four accomplices. However, the main culprits, Lin Pinyuan, Lin Sanmao, and Lin Shouzhis, fled in advance after hearing of the situation. At the beginning of this month, the brigade commander of the 8th Brigade received a tip that the three criminals had secretly returned to their hometown. So, on the 16th of this month, they went to the address in the 14th Bao of Nicheng Township, Pudong, and arrested the three criminals. According to the confessions of the criminals, in November of last year, they colluded with Gu Xiaogen, Bao Yinfa, Shen ChuanGen, Shen Chuanlin, and others to go to the Shi residence late at night.

After the victory, the plaintiff returned, but Yong Xiang and others refused to allow him to enter. The plaintiff requests the court to order the return of the management rights of the temple. It is noted that Xin Ci is currently residing at the Baoben Hall on Changsha Road.</p>
<h3>Shop Apprentice Shows Sympathy and Helps with Student Aid; Hopes for Continued Response from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's student aid fund received a total of 2.2 million yuan on the second day of fundraising yesterday. Reader Maozai donated 2 million yuan alone to the "Honor Team," making him the top donor in the past two days. His enthusiasm is truly touching.</p>
<p>Also, Yao Fugen, who lives on Xiaoshadu Road, sent a letter late last night stating: "I am a loyal reader of Shen Bao. My family was poor when I was young, and I dropped out of school after graduating from elementary school. I now work in a small cigarette paper shop, but I always feel the lack of knowledge and deeply resent the pain of dropping out of school in my childhood.

<h3>Police Bureau Telephone Number Painted on Official Cars; Police Station of the City God Temple Punished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Old West Gate Hong Kong Taxi Company in the South City has not been open for long.

Zhou temporarily agreed out of consideration for face. Who knew that the company would paint the bureau's official telephone number on each taxi and parade it around the city.

<h3>The Lost Golden Age of the Pengli Lake Route; Struggling On</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Poyang, 20th] Poyang Lake is the only reservoir in Jiangxi Province, nurturing the Gan, Rao, Fu, Xin, and Xiu rivers, the five major trunks and tributaries. The Chang and Le rivers are located upstream of the Poyang Lake tributaries. The Chang River originates in Qimen, which borders Jingdezhen and Fuliang, while the Le River originates in Wuyuan, which borders Dexing. Each has a waterway of over 300 miles. The waters of the two rivers flow day and night, ceaselessly and turbulently. In the past, they made the greatest efforts for the lives of people along the rivers. In the past, they transported local products from Wuyuan, Dexing, Wannian, Qimen, Fuliang, and Poyang, loading ships full of goods in batches, and at the same time, they transported Chinese and foreign goods from Suzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jiujiang, loading ships full of goods in batches.</p>
<p>The most famous Jingdezhen porcelain, Leping Mingshan's manganese coal, Poyang's tobacco and grain, and even the foreign tea leaves of Qihong and green tea, which account for a large proportion of exports, all relied on its intake and output to connect the inside and outside, meeting the needs of trade and assisting the unparalleled prosperity of industry and commerce along the river for many years. Therefore, the tributaries of the Chang and Le rivers are the only lifeline of commercial specialties in the counties along the river. In this hinterland where there was no rail transportation in the past, the importance of inland navigation can be imagined.</p>
<p>Former Prosperity</p>
<p>Full Sails Competing</p>
<p>In terms of Poyang Lake shipping tools, just the category of civilian ships alone has as many as 60 types. There are approximately 100,000 large and small ships in the province's inland rivers, employing 500,000 boatmen. The most famous include Fu boats, Ba Dou boats, Crow Tail boats, Diao Zi boats, Full River Red boats, Evening Lotus boats, Crow Tip boats, Ji Tip boats, Rowing boats, Leping boats, and Duck Center boats. The shapes of the boats vary, the names are different, the load-bearing capacities are different, and the speeds are also different. In the early years of the Republic of China, there were more than 50,000 large and small ships on the Chang and Le rivers in Poyang Inner Lake, and the tributaries of Shangrao, Hekou, Yiyang, etc., sailing on the above-mentioned routes, supporting approximately 250,000 people who relied on the boat industry for a living.</p>
<p>At that time, the local products of the counties along the lake, such as black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, and Hekou, green tea from Wuyuan, Dexing, Yushan, and Yujiang, porcelain from Jingdezhen, lotus seeds and tobacco from Poyang, Indigo and coal from Leping, candy paper from Dexing, and miscellaneous grains from Wannian, Yugan, and other counties, were all transported through the Chang and Le Rivers to Poyang Lake and then transshipped to Jiujiang for export. Foreign goods from various counties also relied on these many civilian ships for continuous import. The volume of special products and commercial goods exported and imported throughout the year was astounding. Therefore, the civilian ship transport industry was the most prosperous period in adapting to the times.</p>
<p>The water freight rates for shipping goods by boats are slightly lower in spring and summer and double in autumn and winter. Boat owners soliciting cargo and the industry often has disputes. Accepting transportation and departing, both compete to shorten the time, rushing to reach the destination with rapid efforts; and quickly soliciting cargo and loading for return. At that time, the sails along the lake rivers were fully inflated, like dragon boats racing during the Dragon Boat Festival. The income of boat owners was abundant, and their lives were naturally more comfortable. Whenever they sailed through the waves, the shouts of the boatmen could be heard, and the pole supported them against the current, humming and pushing forward. Their spirit of peace of mind and professionalism could not help but make people envy the true joy of life on the water.</p>
<p>Having Gone Through the Sea</p>
<p>Pole Laborers Quit Their Jobs and Boats Sink</p>
<p>Since the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic of China [1929], the Red Disaster spread southward and the pole laborers quit their jobs and the boats sank to the north. Fang Shao's communist bandits rose up in eastern Jiangxi, invading Leping, Fuliang, Dexing, Wannian, and other counties, and traffic along the Poyang Lake river was blocked. Qimen and Wuyuan's boxed tea and Jingdezhen's porcelain were changed to land routes through Tunxi for export. The special products of other counties were also changed to other routes and methods, and most agricultural products declined due to the uneasiness of bandit disturbances. In order to avoid danger, merchants reduced their imports and mostly transported them by land. As a result, the civilian ship industry along the lake was in a desolate situation, with ships completely suspended and the lives of boat owners becoming increasingly difficult. Some sold their boats and changed their jobs, returning to their hometowns to farm; others sank their boats in the water, hoping to resume their business in the future; or broke their boats into firewood to show their determination to quit their jobs. During these years, occasionally passing by the lake and looking around, there were no boats tied up by the green willow banks; on the reed beaches, the sound of poles could not be heard. This special scene at this time truly made people feel overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and the present!</p>
<p>After the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934], the bandit disasters gradually subsided, and local commerce and industry gradually moved towards the path of restoration. No one could have imagined that while planning to restore, the sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge started the Anti-Japanese War, and the flames of war spread from North China to Southeast China. The Yangtze River waterway was once again blockaded. The inland river civilian ship industry had no freight transport and many corvée services. Civilian ships that had just resumed navigation like a flash in the pan fell into the state after the 18th year of the Republic of China. The opportunity for them to struggle given by the times was lost again. Undoubtedly, their lives and property suffered huge losses, just like the people in the occupied areas, and there was no way to recover. After the restoration in the past year, the power of the atomic bomb</p>
<p>Resuming Sailing Now</p>
<p>Just Making a Last Struggle</p>
<p>After the restoration in the past year, the power of the atomic bomb made the civilian ship industry, an outdated means of transportation that was about to die, revive again as if planted by the spring breeze. Clever merchants then abandoned the previous shortcuts of car transport and used the old routes of civilian ships to serve their cargo transport. In this year, although the original boat owners have gradually resumed sailing, they are not as spectacular as the past ship transport industry.</p>
<p>Speaking of today's shipping, Poyang is still the center of ship gatherings. Along the lake for several miles, boats are lined up and masts are like forests. Every day, civilian ships and steamships sail to various places, to Leping, to Nanchang, to Jiujiang, to Yingtan, to Hekou. In the early morning and evening, the sound of whistles echoes each other. There are still many people who leave here, and many people who meet here again. The emotions of sending off in the middle of the river, the gatherings of shaking hands and saying goodbye, meeting by chance, and being a guest in a foreign land. This situation is still reminiscent of the grand scene of that year.</p>
<p>Poyang is such a water terminal full of farewells and gatherings, with tons and tons of black coal, baskets of porcelain, boxes of tea, and bags of rice and miscellaneous grains gathered here from the production areas of northeastern Jiangxi. Then, coal carriers, steamships, Luo Tongs, Diao Zis, Fu boats, and various types of ships divide their routes to Nanchang, Jiujiang, and other places, and then cotton yarn, cloth, and imported goods are transported from Nanchang and Jiujiang to the rural hinterland of various counties. Between one export and one import, the price given by the goods naturally supports many boat owners and boatmen.</p>
<p>However, times have changed. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Southern Xun railways have been completed and opened to traffic one after another. The Beijing-Jiangxi Railway is now being proposed for restoration. In addition, the trunk and branch highways between Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi are also being repaired quickly. Sensitive merchants naturally abandon the backward means of transportation at this time and use the convenient and enhanced railways and highways as their cargo transportation tools. Although some inland areas that railways and highways do not reach still rely on civilian ships for loading, the remaining quantity must be very low. In general, smart boat owners know that their decline is approaching. Driven by food and clothing, at this time, they all hold the idea of "do one day as a monk and ring the bell for one day," temporarily maintaining their current lives and making a final struggle.

<h3>Township Head Arrests Recruits; Fatal Incident in Rong City</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Fuzhou, 20th] With the start of conscription, unscrupulous township and baojia personnel have acted perversely, ignoring government laws and regulations, and regard this as an opportunity to make a fortune for themselves. It is reported that some people in neighboring counties are buying recruits in Fuzhou City at high prices, which will affect the conscription of volunteers in Fuzhou. It is learned that the city government has ordered strict prohibition. A case recently occurred here in which the arbitrary arrest of recruits led to a fatal incident. It turned out that Wang Shengxian, the township head of Qianyu Township, Linsen County, personally led township soldiers and without the cooperation of local bao police personnel in the urban area, rushed into the Minsheng Western Clothing Store in Zhongzhou, Rong City, claiming to be recruiting soldiers and wanting to arrest Guo Kuitie, the shop owner's nephew. Guo, seeing the situation, fled in a hurry and jumped into the Minjiang River, where he drowned, arousing public outrage among the local people. Guo is 27 years old this year, and is not subject to conscription according to the law. This matter has attracted the attention of the authorities and various sectors.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou's "One-Dragon" Arrested in Bian for Drug Case; Slogans for "Down with Chen" and "Support Chen" Posted Throughout the City</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 20th] Chen Yaolong, chairman of the Zhengzhou General Labor Union, nicknamed "One-Dragon," is one of Zhengzhou's notables. He recently went to Bian, where he was secretly reported to have committed crimes such as drug abuse and drug trafficking, and was arrested by the Henan Provincial Government. Because Chen was also serving as the captain of the Zhengzhou Investigation Team, the case was handed over to the Zhengzhou Headquarters Command for handling, and Chen was also sent to Zhengzhou. All parties in Zhengzhou are paying attention to the case almost as much as they are paying attention to the communist bandit Liu Bocheng's southward flight. Because some who had been harmed by Chen in the past have risen up to launch a "Down with Chen" movement. Some who are currently being supported by Chen have risen up to launch a "Support Chen" movement. As a result, different slogans and leaflets are seen throughout the city. Chen was examined by the Health Institute today (20th) to see if he was addicted to drugs, and the results will be known within three days. However, other parts of the case, such as drug trafficking and whether he had served as a detective captain for the enemy puppets, will require a considerable period of investigation before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Hosts Reporters; Reports on the Current Stage of Banditry</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Hangzhou, 3rd] The banditry in Zhejiang Province has been exaggerated too much by various newspapers. The provincial government specially hosted reporters today, saying: All the bandit gangs in Siming, Kuocang, Kuaiji, Wencheng, and various border areas only number more than 2,000 people. Zhu Zhiguang's bandit force also has only over 100 people, so the 7,000 to 8,000 people reported in various newspapers are really mistaken. In Changhua and Yuqian counties on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui, communist bandits recently planned to attack Changhua County, and the situation was tense for a while, but fortunately they were repelled by our Zhejiang Protection Force.</p>
<h3>Fishing Disputes Occur Frequently in Shangyu and Shaoxing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, 23rd] Fishermen from Shangyu and Shaoxing counties often have disputes due to conflicting interests. Although Commissioner Zheng Xiaoyin of the Third District Commissioner's Office personally handled the fishing area disputes in May of this year fairly and issued a ruling, announcing that both parties should abide by it, recently the fishermen of Shaoxing suddenly broke the agreement, prohibiting the fishermen of Shangyu from fishing in the area designated by Commissioner Zheng, and even hijacking the fishing boats of Shangyu and driving them to the central sandbar, taking photos forcibly, and accusing the fishermen of Shangyu of violating the ruling. A member of the county's fishermen's association suffered such illegal bullying and cannot remain silent. He has issued a statement on the incident and appealed to the people of Zhejiang and both Zhejiang provinces, requesting that justice be upheld.</p>
<h3>Su Senator Cheng Zhengqing Case; District Prosecutor's Office Conducts Initial Investigation</h3>

<h3>Changzhou City Council Unanimously Passes; Impeachment of the Director of the Education Bureau; Dispatches Telegrams to the Provincial and County Governments for Investigation and Handling</h3>

<h3>People Gone, Building Empty, How to Execute? Xinyu Grain Official Sentenced to Seventeen Years</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanchang, 18th] Tan Ruwen, the former section chief of the Xinyu County Farmland and Grain Management Office, abused his authority while in office, engaging in corruption and dereliction of duty. He was reported and a total of five cases were filed against him. The district court concluded four cases, and he was sentenced to a total of nine years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for nine years. While serving his sentence in prison, he took the opportunity to escape while being temporarily released from prison to be interrogated in the fifth case. Now the fifth case has also been concluded, and he has been sentenced to another eight years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for eight years for directly profiting from the affairs under his management. Together with the previous sentences, he should serve a total of seventeen years in prison, but with "people gone and the building empty," how to execute the sentence is truly an interesting story.</p>
<h3>One of the Four Great Rice Markets: Wuxi's Unprecedented Prosperity; Rice Boats Concentrated at Shuanghekou, Stem to Stern; Every Warehouse Piled High with Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>[Wuxi, 20th Dispatch] Wuxi is renowned throughout the nation as a land of fish and rice. For thousands of years, residents of both urban and rural areas have enjoyed abundant food and clothing, with collective disturbances rarely occurring. Unfortunately, on the fifth day of the fifth month of this year, because the price of rice suddenly soared from 80,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) to over 200,000 yuan within three days, many rice shops refused to sell rice, triggering a rice-grabbing frenzy. Although the police authorities dispatched officers to suppress it, the tide of anger could not be stopped in time. In less than half a day, the grabbing spread to both inside and outside the city. It was not until the garrison troops assisted in implementing martial law late at night that the serious situation was quelled. The total loss was estimated to be over five to six thousand shi.</p>
<p>Recently, although the price of rice has risen from over 200,000 yuan to over 400,000 yuan per shi, this should be attributed to the effective measures taken by the county government. Social order is very peaceful. In the past month, rice and grains from various places have poured in like a tide. Dozens of warehouses throughout the county are piled high with rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, making it impossible for latecomers to find space. In the river channel from Sanli Bridge to Shuanghekou outside Wu Bridge, rice boats are connected stem to stern, without the slightest gap. At its peak, there were over 5,000 boats docked. The sources of these rice boats range from nearby neighboring counties to places as far as Hunan and Sichuan. Because the price of rice is cheap in those areas, they travel thousands of miles to Wuxi to sell it, thus creating an unprecedented prosperity not seen in hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Judging from the recent prosperity of the Wuxi rice market, it seems that a detailed investigation and statistics of the rice shortage in various places is still necessary. If the authorities can thoroughly study the production and sales of rice throughout the country and make reasonable adjustments and circulation, I believe the rice shortage can definitely be reduced in severity. (Xi Lin)</p>
<p>The coal mined will be used, with 80% supplied to various places in Beijing and Shanghai, and the remainder used by the company's own coal factory.</p>

<h3>Leaders of All Circles in Shanghai Discussed Yesterday at Tea Party: Problem of Scholarships for Poor Students; Target of 5 Billion, Full Amount Recognized Immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Paper] Leaders of all circles in this city, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Xuan Tiewu, Yan Zhuang, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilu, Wu Kaixian, Wu Shaoshu, Gu Yuxiu, Zhu Jingnong, and others, in order to assist poor students in schools at all levels in this city, to hold scholarships, specially named Dong to please enthusiastic people from all walks of life, on the afternoon of yesterday Four o'clock, held a tea party on the 14th floor of the International Hotel to discuss the problem of raising scholarships for poor students. More than eighty guests arrived, including Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yun Chu, Liu Gongyun, Mei Lanfang, Wang Yunsheng, Cheng Zhongxing, Wang Zhuyi, and university presidents Zhang Yi, O Yuanhuai, Dai Cuilun, and others. Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, happened to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning and was also invited to participate.</p>
<p>Worried About High Tuition Fees</p>
<p>First, Mayor Wu, the chairman, made a speech, explaining that the schools will soon begin, and students in universities, middle and primary schools are worried about the high tuition fees, especially the poor students. In view of the recent voluntary fundraising and charity sales by students from various schools, it is enough to prove the plight of the students. It is not only dangerous for them to buy on the streets, but also affects social order. We should try to help the next generation of students to study with peace of mind. I have made preliminary consultations with all parties, and the city will organize a unified student assistance agency to coordinate the work. All donation agencies can still retain their names, so that it is easy to raise public support and fairness. Those who agree with this principle of donation can participate in the supervision of this agency. The detailed method will be discussed later. Wu Kaixian then rose to say: This time, students who receive scholarships should know the source of the donations, and those with excellent grades will continue to be awarded scholarships in the future. At the same time, donors can designate students to study specialized academics, and guarantee their careers after graduation. Excellent award-winning students will surely be able to study with peace of mind. Lu Ganchen, based on the experience of the Youth Association in handling scholarships over the years, believes that scholarships should be widespread and suggested that school principals and relevant forces study and implement good methods.</p>
<p>Expand Fundraising and Proceed Regularly</p>
<p>Cheng Zhongxing was invited to speak and explained that the News has been donating scholarships for a long time. He believes that personal wealth is taken from society and should also be contributed to society, expand fundraising, and should proceed regularly. Wang Yunsheng said in his speech that the country should pay attention to national education. The education budget is too small, and the planned six-year compulsory education has not yet been implemented and cannot be compared with Japan. General MacArthur is now ordering Japan to conduct another three years of compulsory education. Since the war, college students in our country have been supplied with public funds, forming a partial state. From the next issue, the public funding for universities will be cancelled, and it is necessary to raise scholarships. After the university burden is rationalized, its funding should be used to enrich national education, and it is hoped that it will be implemented next year. At this point, Vice Minister Hang declared that the Ministry of Education is currently planning to strive for 15% of the education budget in accordance with the Constitution and will strive to enrich national education in the future. The Far East Basic Education Conference held in Beijing on September 1 is enough to prove the importance of national education? Hang suggested that schools increase the service opportunities for students to work part-time and study part-time to reduce the number of young people out of school. Finally, he expressed his gratitude to all walks of life in Shanghai for their enthusiastic assistance to poor students.</p>
<p>Tremendous Benefit from Assisting Scholarships</p>
<p>Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan spoke, saying that school fees are too high, not only poor students cannot afford it, but also the parents of ordinary students feel the difficulty of their children's tuition fees. If a solution is not sought quickly, it may cause student unrest in the future. The financial resources of the government and local governments are also difficult. Now, society is helping scholarships, and students benefit greatly. After measurement, Zhang Yi, President of Fudan University, represented the universities and expressed his thanks to all sectors of society for their kindness.</p>
<p>Zhang also suggested two points: (1) Narrow scholarships, give special bonuses to students with special academic and moral excellence, (2) Broad scholarships, today's social and economic situation is not good, and ordinary students are unable to study, and those whose academic and moral behavior are above the standard should be generally rewarded. The two can be parallel without contradiction. Jun also had many specific suggestions for the organization of scholarship institutions and methods, which will be left to be decided at a meeting next week. The tea party was successfully concluded at about 7 o'clock.</p>
<p>In addition: Mayor Wu announced at the tea party that the goal of raising scholarships this time is 5 billion yuan, and all parties immediately recognized the full amount on the spot, and decided to continue fundraising, and Mayor Wu will convene all parties next week to organize fundraising institutions to discuss the way forward. The amount of recognition donated by all parties yesterday is as follows: Shanghai Stock Exchange 1 billion yuan, Industrial and Commercial Bank 300 million yuan, City Bank 200 million yuan, Municipal Government 500 million yuan, Students writing election tickets 500 million yuan, Shen Bao 300 million yuan, News 500 million yuan, Youth Association 700 million yuan, Youth League 250 million yuan, Anonymous 250 million yuan, Mei Lanfang Zhou Xinfang invited famous artists to perform charity shows, raising 500 million yuan, the amount recognized by Ta Kung Pao is pending.</p>

<h3>Review of Imported Cotton Purchases Completed, China Trust Sets Up Spinning Method, First Batch of 19,144 Bales Purchased</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The China Trust Bureau has completed the review of the application for the purchase of imported cotton. The China Trust Bureau, the Textile Adjustment Committee, the China Textile Construction Company, and other relevant agencies have discussed the issues of spinning and sales of this imported cotton several times and have formulated the following methods:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the purchase part (1) For the imported cotton purchased by our association, if the applicant is a yarn factory, it will be handed over to the applicant yarn factory for acceptance. In addition to signing a spinning contract with the factory and handing over the cotton for spinning to the factory for storage, the remaining cotton that is unwilling to spin (no more than 50%) shall be issued by the factory with a warehouse receipt in the name of our bureau, so that it can be combined with the imported cotton purchased from non-yarn factory applicants. In addition to appropriately allocating a part of it to the yarn factories that applied for spinning to the Six District Association before July 31, the rest will be handed over to the China Textile Construction Company for acceptance and spinning.</p>
<p>(2) It is proposed that the purchased imported cotton be inspected and accepted by the buyer together with the spinning factory and the public brokerage house. After weighing, payment will be made based on the quantity and quality of the code list. If foreign manufacturers and banks do not allow payment after weighing and acceptance, the CIF Shanghai price will be paid first, and the interest, insurance, and bank handling fees for deferred payment will be paid after the cotton is officially accepted and verified. The foreign exchange and bank handling fees that have been paid for insurance ( % ) shall be paid in legal currency at the official price.</p>
<p>(3) If the CIF Shanghai price is paid first, the yarn factory applying for the purchase of cotton shall convert the cotton yarn according to the quantity of cotton purchased and hand it over to the China Trust Bureau. If any damage or shortage is found during acceptance, the yarn factory shall contact for claims settlement by itself. The quantity of cotton yarn to be paid shall not be reduced. When a non-yarn factory applies, a bank guarantee statement must be prepared, stating that if there is a shortage in acceptance, it guarantees to return the foreign exchange within five days with the notarization certificate of the public notary, and all claims shall be borne by the applicant.</p>
<p>(4) After the China Trust Bureau signs a purchase and sale contract with the applicant, it will request the Central Bank to remit the price abroad to the payee with the bank guarantee. The applicant does not need to issue separate invoices or receipts.</p>
<p>(5) The imported cotton purchased by our association shall be sent to the Transportation Management Committee to issue a permit with the simplest procedure to declare and pick up the goods.</p>
<p>(6) After the imported cotton purchased by our association is paid for and purchased, it shall be insured by the spinning factory (including the processing fee).</p>
<p>(7) The first batch of applications has been reviewed and approved for purchase in 24 cases, totaling 19.144 bales of cotton. For the six cases that do not fully comply with the original date, a signed report will be submitted to the President for approval before purchasing.</p>
<h3>Yarn to be Delivered by Spinning Factories in One Month</h3>
<p>(B) Regarding the spinning and export part (1) Each spinning factory shall deliver the yarn within one month after acceptance and send the delivery schedule and bill of lading to the China Trust Bureau first. (Shenxin is allowed to deliver all the goods within one and a half months due to the large quantity. The China Textile Construction Company will deliver the existing yarn for the imported cotton it sells, and the delivery period for other spinning will be negotiated separately).</p>
<p>(2) When the bill of lading is sent to the China Trust Bureau, the approved processing fee shall be paid to the spinning factory in full.</p>
<p>(3) The spinning cotton yarn shall be negotiated according to the cotton procedure. The number of cotton yarn to be handed over shall be based on the principle of exchanging the same amount of foreign exchange in order to facilitate the spinning factory to deliver the goods quickly.</p>
<p>(4) The cotton yarn delivered by each spinning factory shall be inspected and accepted by the China Textile Construction Company. The China Textile Construction Company shall contact the export of the cotton yarn spun by the China Textile Construction Company itself and negotiate and decide with the China Trust Bureau. However, the spinning factory may also contact the export first, and finally consult with the China Textile Construction Company and the China Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>(5) The processing fee and round-trip freight required for spinning in yarn factories in other places shall not exceed the processing fee of yarn factories in this city in principle.</p>
<p>(6) The processing fee proposed by the China Textile Construction Company for 20-count yarn is 2,418,846,26 yuan (including 500,000 yuan for losses in the Northeast), and the processing fee proposed by the Association for 20-count yarn is 2,729,025,29 yuan, plus 10% profit. The Association believes that the proposed figure cannot be reduced any further. The China Textile Construction Company believes that the Association's figure is very reasonable and lower than that set by the Textile Adjustment Committee. It was decided to sign and submit it to the President for approval.</p>

<p>Because the production cost of fir wood is 1,900 yuan, plus water freight, it will lose money according to the Shanghai market price, so most sellers sell it. Occasionally, there are those who seek cash, but the minimum is 2,350 yuan, and foreign pine is still stable.</p>
<p>Tea Market is Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchant tea market was still sluggish, and the market was quiet. According to people in the industry, since the official opening of Qimen new black tea by Jardine Matheson a few days ago, there are still seekers at the moment, but they dislike the price being too high, so the transaction has stopped again. However, it is heard that if the price is around 2 million yuan per dan, sales may continue. The minds of the shops in the local area and the merchants from other places are average for various domestic sales teas.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market was very rare for resale in the market. The local office was healthy, and the chips were thin. The market continued to rise. Changhou ten-pack British cigarettes rose to 22.42 million yuan, a further increase of 370,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The other strip cigarettes from Chinese manufacturers also saw an increase, and the price of American strip cigarettes also rose due to the lack of arrivals.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Tea and Camphor Exports are Active</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Taipei, 23rd] After the foreign exchange adjustment, the export of Taiwan tea and camphor has suddenly improved. 400,000 pounds of oolong black tea are sold at an average of 4 corners and 1 cent in the United States. This year, the tea company can produce 1.5 million pounds. The monthly production of camphor is 100 tons, and the production this year is 1,310 tons, but the price is yet to be determined. The transportation and sales methods need to be strengthened. Both items have increased by three and a half times.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Import and Export Limited to US$100</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Jianghai Customs recently issued a bulletin: "According to the order of the Chief Inspector of Customs, the government stipulates in Article 34 of the Central Bank's foreign exchange management regulations: 'The import and export of all foreign currency banknotes are prohibited without the permission of the Ministry of Finance, but each traveler may carry a number within US$100 or other foreign currency banknotes of equal value.' Article 35: 'The import and export of all foreign currency securities are prohibited without the permission of the Ministry of Finance.' If the amount of banknotes carried by the above-mentioned passengers exceeds US$100 or its equivalent value, the excess amount shall be handled in accordance with the current regulations."</p>
<h3>Rumors Spread, Interest Rate Low, Chinese Stocks Turned Down After Popularity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were bought by major players who were matched off-market. The interest rate opened low at 6 points and 1 point 05, and the buying interest was relatively revived. Therefore, rumors in the industry still focused on reducing the margin requirement for delivering securities from 50% to 30%. It is said that there is great confidence. There are also various other speculations, and outsiders have also heard many rumors about the currency system, but the younger generation has pressure at the top, and the market turned down after popularity.</p>
<p>The market opened steadily in the morning. After the opening, No. 26 and others entered the current Yongsheng yarn, and No. 35 and others entered the delivered Yongsheng yarn, once approaching 220 yuan. No. 218 and others came to sell, once falling to 216 yuan. No. 116 and others entered Shangwei stocks, rising to 220 yuan. After the supply of No. 180 and others, it fell back to 217 yuan. No. 16 and others came to enter, and the interest rate off-market opened low at 6 points and 1 point 05, and some opened low at 4 points and 9 points, and people's hearts were boosted. The tug-of-war situation for an hour and a half was finally broken. The delivered Yongsheng yarn rose to 222 yuan, and No. 226 and No. 119 frantically bought the current Yongsheng yarn. No. 15 and others sold at high prices, and police officers came to dismantle the intercom telephone off-market, falling back to 217 yuan. No. 23 and others still accepted the current Yongsheng yarn, and No. 135 and others also entered the delivered Yongsheng yarn, rising to the high prices of 221 yuan and 223 yuan. After being suppressed by Yang of the younger generation, entrusted to No. 158 and No. 45, it began to fall back slightly. No. 130 sold the current Yongsheng yarn, and No. 110 and others also settled the delivered Yongsheng yarn, falling again to 217 yuan near noon. With the strong support of No. 223, the morning closed with the current Yongsheng yarn ending at the prices of 217 yuan and 220 yuan.</p>
<p>After the close, No. 218 and others had supplies, and the asking price was slightly lower. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the spot stocks increased by about half a percent for Yongsheng, Xinyi, and Zhongfa, and Xin Guang, Meiya, Yonggong, and Jingfu rose slightly. Qinxing and Xinhua remained stable, Datong fell slightly, and Li'an, Jinglun, and Shangwu rose by half a percent. Neiyi and Xinya were also stable, and the remaining stocks all rose slightly. The delivered stocks increased slightly for Yongsheng, Xinyi, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xin Guang, and the off-market Gu Lao stocks were stable.</p>
<h3>US Exchange Rate Unchanged, British Exchange Rate Reduced</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee approved the benchmark price of the US exchange rate yesterday, which remained at the original price of 38,500 yuan. However, the benchmark price of the pound sterling was extended to 120,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,200 yuan compared with the previous price. It is reported that the Stabilization Committee, in view of the current disjunction between the US and British exchange rates, the fixed US and British exchange rates are no longer necessary. In the future, the actual situation will be considered and adjusted at any time. According to the benchmark price of the pound sterling yesterday, the US-British arbitrage rate is only about US$3.117 per pound sterling.</p>
<p>Designated Banks Appropriately Reduce the Difference</p>
<p>In addition, the outside world believes that the difference between the buying and selling prices of the British exchange rate of designated banks is 2,000 yuan from a certain standard price, which is considered to be too expensive. The United Association of Designated Banks held a meeting on the 22nd and agreed that from the 25th, the market price of buying and selling British exchange rates would be 1,500 yuan different from the benchmark price, a reduction of 500 yuan compared with this week.</p>
<h3>Five Directors of the Import and Export Management Committee Have Been Announced</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Import and Export Management Committee officially announced the candidates for the five directors yesterday, namely: (1) Shen Zou Ting, Director of the Import Quota Allocation Office, (2) Chen Jun Ren, Director of the Non-Quota Import Examination Office, (3) Zhang Fu Yun, Director of the Import Signing Office, (4) Shen Xi Rui, Director of the Export Promotion Office, (5) Yang Heng, Director of the Secretariat. In addition, Yu Yingjie, the former Director of the Non-Quota Allocation Office, has been sent to Hong Kong to implement the matters stipulated in the agreement signed with the Hong Kong government.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to show an upward trend, and people's hearts were excited. However, scattered retail investors sold at high prices in the middle, and the price slightly fell back. As a result, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn still rose by 550,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to 17.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market was popular yesterday, and the market rose. In particular, Biji from the China Textile Construction Company has not yet been sold, and the asking price is even more popular. As a result, the price of Sijunzi Jin Yin Yuan Biji rose by 10,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to 493,000 yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose to 460,000 yuan, an increase of 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Cloth</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 21,500 bolts of cloth and 740 sheets. There were a total of 445 application forms. 22 domestic manufacturers purchased 3,680 bolts. 423 cloth shops purchased 17,400 bolts of cloth and 740 sheets. The price of 12-pound Caichiu fine cloth was 363,000 yuan, and the successful applicants added 8,500 yuan. There were many buyers. 20-count extra fine cloth was 340,000 yuan, and only manufacturers could apply for it.</p>
<p>Sparse Spot Cotton Transactions</p>
<p>Because yarn factories mostly purchased on the previous day, the market was sluggish yesterday, and the industry had very few transactions due to Saturday. The market was slightly softer, and the prices of each grade were: Lingbao 2.04 million, Shandong Tuolikesi 1.95 million, Sanyuzhen 1.8 million, Huoji substandard goods 1.46 million, Shashi 1.97 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton 300,080 yuan.</p>

The Tiemol ship, managed by Wen Da British Company, came to Shanghai from London via India, Singapore, and Hong Kong the day before, carrying 5,500 pieces of cotton from Mumbai.</p>

<h3>Collected Essays of Thomas Mann</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The great German writer Thomas Mann occupies a special place in our culture. His reputation is vast, but those who have read his great works still do not fully understand his thinking. This is worth our attention.</p>
<p>If we affirm that the two greatest living literary figures are Bernard Shaw and Thomas Mann, no one would be surprised. However, Shaw often mixes in mockery, while Thomas Mann does not. Thomas Mann is quite like the French Corneille or the English Ben Jonson. He has also recently written political essays, which adds another layer of glory to his reputation.</p>
<p>Now his "Essays of Three Decades" has been translated into English by H.T. Lowe-Porter. This collection of essays can answer the question: on which side does Mann stand? We might answer: on the one hand, he promotes the gospel of reason, opposing the irrationality of Fascism; on the other hand, he is an opponent of Western culture, so he seems to be standing on the side of irrationality himself. In fact, Mann is a multifaceted person whose thought has gradually developed. In his youth, he felt that the Western intellectual class was too rational. Later, when the irrational tide of Fascism swept through Europe, Mann immediately and clearly sided with the defense of reason. But Mann is still Mann. Except for rare moments of political passion, he feels that modern liberal psychology is superficial and lacks religious and tragic depth. Mann believes that liberals should learn from Schopenhauer, Wagner, and Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Later, Mann liberated himself from Orientalism and nationalism, as can be seen in his "Order of the Day," published in the United States five years ago. This is political liberation. As for philosophical liberation, it is found in the current "Essays of Three Decades." Goethe is Mann's lifeline, and Freud throws him a life raft. Goethe successfully reconciled wisdom and instinct, light and darkness. Freud showed that reason can bravely face irrationality and even directly explore its depths. Mann is not like optimistic liberals, but faces "death." However, unlike the irrationality of the decadent, he does not desire death. He believes that death can be overcome by love, while reason cannot overcome death. Mann is probably more profound in his understanding of modern writers who affirm life; and of modern writers who have profound insights, Mann is probably the most beautifully affirmative of life.</p>
<p>It seems only half right to say that Mann turned to democracy, or that he belongs to the German bourgeoisie or the Romantics. He himself knows that the latter still lives in him, but the latter is contained within the former. We know a lot about Mann as a "symbol of democracy," but we don't yet know about Mann as "reactionary."</p>
<p>"Essays of Three Decades" is a more satisfying book than "Order of the Day." To be honest, Mann is not a political commentator. He cannot pretend to be a social prophet. He is a poet, and his inner self is a harmonizer of nature and spirit. Reading his short essays on Storm, Fontane, or Chamisso always feels more nourishing than reading his appeal to the German people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this recent book does not include all of Mann's non-political essays. It does not include any essays written after the outbreak of World War II in 1939, nor does it include the best essays from "Past Masters," published in 1933, nor does it include "Freud's Position in the History of Modern Thought." Nevertheless, it is still a rich book, fully expressing the topics discussed and Mann's interests and insights. His essays are extremely profound and broad, neither purely personal nor strictly objective. The three best articles are: "Goethe and Tolstoy," "Wagner's Suffering and Greatness," and "Schopenhauer." To understand Thomas Mann's thought, one should also read these three.</p>
<p>This is a good book. The reviewer may find it difficult to discern his precise thinking. Now, let's write down Thomas Mann's views on writing as a conclusion.</p>
<p>A writer should have brains. Mann said: "A completely stupid poet often dreams of romantic nature worship." But brains alone are not enough, and even adding innate creative genius is not enough. Mann said that two more elements are needed: culture and tradition. In Europe and America, every writer with brains, whose work becomes a bestseller, can become a celebrity and live comfortably for the rest of his life. Whenever a new book is published, book clubs introduce his book, and he can earn a large income. Mann believes that he should still work quietly and gradually, regardless of his living environment, and not be carried away by joy.</p>
<p>Regarding the practice of another group of writers, Mann believes that they should enthusiastically study the work of the masters and warmly accept the cultural heritage. Even the greatest writers are lifelong apprentices. Thomas Mann's humility is truly worthy of pride. In one essay, he often refers to himself as a student of Wagner. In another essay discussing Goethe's greatness, he said: "We modern people are merely conductors of fire." Shouldn't we writers learn this kind of humility? But how few such people there are!</p>
<p>The above is all from Eric Bentley's review. According to the "Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature," p. 510, Thomas Mann lived in Switzerland after 1933, where he ran a publication called "Mass und Wert" (1937). After he came to the United States in 1938, he published two more political essays, "The Coming Victory of Democracy" and "This Peace." Thomas Mann also wrote a four-volume epic novel, which includes: (1) "Die Geschichten Jakobs, 1933" (The Stories of Jacob), (2) "Der junge Joseph, 1935" (Young Joseph), (3) "Joseph in Aegypten, 1936" (Joseph in Egypt), (4) "Joseph, der Ernährer, 1944" (Joseph the Provider). In addition, he also wrote "Lotte in Weimar, 1940" and the novella "Die vertauschten Köpfe, 1940" (The Transposed Heads).</p>
<h3>The Personality of the Painter</h3>
<p>— Shi Liangfu</p>
<p>Before the Eastern Jin Dynasty of the Six Dynasties, our country's painting thought had not yet become a system. In fragmentary painting theories, all painters respected the word "personality" as the soul of painting. In ancient times, there was a distinction between artisan painters and artist painters, and personality was the dividing line. Wang Xizhi's "Treatise on Painting" first mentioned the issue of the painter's personality. He believed that the elegance or vulgarity of a work depended entirely on the elegance or vulgarity of the individual's personality.</p>
<p>Indeed, many historical facts, ancient and modern, prove that this is an irrefutable truth.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Chinese painting takes "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (spiritual consonance and lifelike quality) as the standard for evaluation. Qi Yun Sheng Dong is not only expressed in the external brushstrokes, but also originates from the internal identity and personality. The internal and external mutually cause each other, and the Qi Yun naturally flows out.</p>
<p>Turning through painting theories, it is rare not to talk about "personality." The following three quotes can show one aspect of this:</p>
<p>Shen Zongqian said: "Although the brush and ink come from the hand, they are rooted in the heart. How can one have a transcendent style with meanness in one's heart? How can one have a serene spirit if one's self-esteem is not released?"</p>
<p>Zhang Pushan said: "Da Chi (Huang Gongwang) was frank and unrestrained, so his paintings are plain and serene... Ni Yunlin (Ni Zan) was completely aloof from the world, so his paintings are remote and detached. If Wang Shuming (Wang Meng) inevitably coveted glory and attached himself to power, his paintings are close to impetuous. Zhao Wenmin (Zhao Mengfu) did not cherish his integrity, so his calligraphy and paintings are both charming and vulgar."</p>
<p>Wen Zhengming said: "If a person's character is not high, their use of ink is without method. Then one knows that putting a dot of ink on paper is not easy. One must have nothing in one's heart, and then the misty clouds and beautiful scenery and the life-giving energy of heaven and earth will naturally gather under the brush, creating wonders. If one is preoccupied with worldly thoughts and has not washed away one's impurities, even if one faces hills and valleys every day and imitates masterpieces every day, in the end, one will only compete with the artisans of lacquer and plaster for skill in minute details."</p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<p>There is such a record in "Hua Yan": "Plum Blossom Taoist Wu Zhonggui (Wu Zhen) originally lived next door to Sheng Zizhao. People from all directions sought Sheng Zizhao's paintings with gold and silk, but Zhonggui's door was deserted, and his wife and children laughed at him. Zhonggui said: 'It won't be like this in twenty years.' As expected, it was as he said. Although Sheng was skilled, he had conventional brushwork and a limited scope, unlike Zhonggui, who was rough and unconstrained and had the style of a recluse. Is this not what is meant by Qi Yun?'" The reason for Sheng Zizhao's decline was that he sought profit like a merchant. Over time, although his works were skilled, a merchant atmosphere had covered his psychological perception and his paintings. Even if they were called exquisite, they were no longer precious.</p>
<p>In the pile of books, criticisms, judgments, and historical facts like these are too numerous to mention if you seek them out carefully. This shows how much ancient painters valued the cultivation of their character.</p>
<p>In contrast, what about the current Chinese painting scene? In recent years, due to continuous warfare, under the economic distress of the entire country, everyone has been exhausted in their efforts to make a living. Officials and civilians in and out of the government have no time to take care of "cultivating virtue." Painters engaged in artistic activities are no exception, and they do not pay much attention to the "doctrine" that "if a person's character is not high, their use of ink is without method." Therefore, today's Sheng Zizhaos are simply abundant, everywhere! Not only that, but there are also many painters who are not interested in painting, but use painting as a bridge to run around the doors of powerful people, seeking profit and fame. Compared with Zizhao, they are even worse!</p>
<p>As for the style of painters like Wu Zhonggui and Zhu Da Shi Tao, who in Shanghai doesn't laugh at them like Ah Q?</p>
<p>Of course, I do not advocate that painters should be isolated from society, nor can I say that painters can be hungry. However, the prevalence of the trend of treating painting as a commodity and putting profit first is, after all, a serious crisis for the future of Chinese painting. I ask the wise, do you agree?</p>
<h3>Xi Zi Zhuang Man - Autumn Sentiments</h3>
<p>— Xu Bangda</p>
<p>Autumn enters the withering plane tree, cicada chirps turn sharp, secretly reflecting on Xi Shi's beautiful eyebrows, the jade rope low in the night, how long. Leaning on the dangerous building, the phoenix flute plays a plaintive tune. (Rhymes with "Ye") The blue sky has been ancient, and the blue sea has been deep and obstructed year after year; considering the human world, cut off the Hui Wen Suzhou brocade, lightly leaving sorrow to gather. At the long pavilion road, having broken all the soft branches, it also understands having no sentiment; even more can endure the falling Chu minister's heart; giving the ascending, broken clouds and drizzling rain, Wen Jun slowly dances, how to divide towards the river maples and mournful drums, only the cold tide rushes urgently, the distant shore is deep and silent.</p>
<h3>A Self-Taught Young Artist</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Zhou Dongguang is my young friend. He has walked the arduous path of self-study for five or six years, and has made considerable efforts. Today, it can be said that he has taken the first step on the road to success.</p>
<p>In the first spring after the start of the Pacific War, Yide was going to the interior. On the night before his departure, he said to me: "Zhou Dongguang, a primary school teacher in Nanxiang, is a young friend who has a passion for painting. I hope you can give him more guidance in the future."</p>
<p>It turned out that Dongguang was a friend who used his bicycle to travel from Nanxiang to Yide's studio every day when the Nite Studio recruited summer students in the 29th year (?). After the summer vacation, he still brought his works to Shanghai every Sunday to ask Yide for advice. Although he teaches at a primary school in Nanxiang, he spends all his time and energy on painting research in addition to teaching. He has no "models," only the fields of the countryside; he has no oil paints and easels, only some simple watercolor painting equipment. But he is not discouraged. On the contrary, under heavy work and material difficulties, he has indeed received rewards. These rewards are the dozens of watercolor paintings publicly exhibited in the Da Xin Gallery a few days ago.</p>
<p>Dongguang once discovered the weakness of his own drawing foundation and often discussed with me about going to art school. However, in this day and age, what power does a primary school teacher in a rural area have to afford the cost of art school? Fortunately, Yongsen agreed to my request and accepted Dongguang as a free student at the Shanghai branch of Suzhou Art College. Finally, he completed the preliminary course under the condition of working and studying. Although this is the function of school education, in Dongguang, I only think that this is still a well-deserved achievement of his self-study. Don't believe me, there are quite a few art school graduates, but according to what I know, the number of people who can achieve the same meager achievements as Dongguang is not very large, let alone that Dongguang is still a poor student?</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Yaoqun took a look and suddenly understood, everything was clear in her heart, so she remained calm and asked Little Tiger; "Why did you run to the station too?"</p>
<p>"Look, Aunt Ji," Little Tiger blinked his big round eyes; "If I didn't come, your bag of money would be gone. I saw that guy behind you, so I grabbed him and snatched the bag back. See?" Little Tiger raised the money bag; thinking that his fabricated story had no loopholes.</p>
<p>"This won't work, Tiger brother!" Yaoqun tightened her face: "No matter what, I can't take you. Let's go, let's go back; I'm not going anymore."</p>
<p>"Mom already promised me!" Little Tiger, seeing that his wonderful "deceiving the heavens" plan was seen through by Yaoqun, had to use the old trick of being a rascal; "I'm not going back!... You go back, I won't go back either. I've been to Beiping, I'll go find Uncle Zhang..." Saying that, he grabbed his little baggage and prepared to buy a ticket.</p>
<p>Yaoqun had no choice but to coax and deceive, promising to go back to the fort to discuss; "Even if you want to go, it's not so easy, you still have to get a 'permit' and go through customs procedures..." Only then did she trick Little Tiger out of the station. The two were just about to hire a car when someone from the inn came chasing after them, saying that Long Fifth Master and Little Tiger's mother had both come to the city, and they had really agreed to let Little Tiger go to Beiping with Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"This child is really fond of you," Little Tiger's mother blessed Yaoqun twice; "You just fulfill his wish; let him go out and gain some experience. Anyway, this child is quite clever and has some skills. You really need a child like this to run errands for you, or something... Who told you to be so fond of him all the time?"</p>
<p>This was a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Even Yaoqun didn't expect to be back so soon; even more unexpectedly, the situation in Shenyang had changed again, becoming so fast and so much more serious; so on the way back to the old fort, she had to be even more careful.</p>
<p>As soon as they arrived at the fourth station, Yaoqun dismissed the car, returned to the city overnight, hurriedly changed clothes with Little Tiger, took the horse whip, and each rode a horse, chasing the wind and chasing the electricity, and galloped away.</p>
<p>At this time, if you happened to be wandering in this mountain area, by the afterglow of a waning moon, you could see two inferior horses on a winding path at the bottom of the valley, shape and shadow together, like two small clumps of black clouds being swept by a whirlwind, chasing each other one after another. If you get closer and take a look, you will feel as if you are in the era of knights, with a close-up shot of heroic swordsmen galloping on angry horses for the injustices of the world. At this time, Yao Hua and Little Tiger, following the night-walking rules of the fort, were wearing wind hoods on their heads, capes on their shoulders, all in dark blue; with a German-style ten-shot pistol on one side of their waist, and a real-bullet rifle on the saddle. Coincidentally, most of the horses in the old fort were improved breeds of Mongolian and Japanese horses, mostly dark brown and jujube color, so even the people and horses were like a clump of dark clouds in the moonlight.</p>
<p>In principle, the old fort has arrangements on all routes, and travel should be safe. Why must they be so fully armed and make it so hot, as if facing a great enemy? It is not known that as soon as you leave the city and highways in the Northeast, you have returned to the fifteenth century from the twentieth century. Except for large groups, plus armed escorts, it is really not easy to walk. Those half-breeds, red beards, unfilial bandits, poisoned Koreans, Japanese ronin, and nominal detectives are all unscrupulous robbers. Especially on these small paths in the deep mountains, valleys, forests, and deserts, everyone is in danger of being attacked suddenly; so armed security has become necessary.</p>

<h3>Starting with Dancers</h3>

<p>Should dancers go to the kitchen or be nurses? I say the dancers should speak for themselves.</p>
<p>If dancers can be given better training, they may have outstanding talents; and dancers who are willing to endure hardship and want to be people are not without hope.</p>
<p>Before the war, I saw a drama written and directed by the dancers themselves, and they knew very well the pain they suffered.</p>
<p>Dancers, why don't you say a few words for yourselves?</p>
<p>The donations of scholarship assistance for poor students in Shanghai, blocking pedestrians for money, seem slightly inferior to those of students in Beiping.</p>
<p>Poor students in Beiping, in order to raise scholarship assistance funds, work on their own during the summer vacation; for example, a large number of students are mobilized to shine shoes for the public. This form of scholarship assistance movement is respectable and moving! Rich children can take cars to school, and poor students automatically shine shoes on the streets for the tuition fees for the next semester. Their actions themselves already have the value of "social education."</p>
<p>We support the spraying of DDT on tricycles and rickshaws for the health of passengers.</p>
<p>However, two-wheeled rickshaw drivers often sweat all day long on the streets, and when passengers are rushing in the constant wind, they often smell a salty sourness, which seems unhygienic. Even if DDT is sprayed, what's the use?</p>
<p>I have to digress, the three-wheeled rickshaw drivers and their slums really need "hygiene," I wonder if there is so much free DDT available?</p>

<h3>The Dream of Japanese Goods Flooding the Market</h3>
<p>— Wang Runyuan</p>
<p>— Ajinomoto and Kadou Eye Drops are Coming!</p>
<p>Occasionally, in Hongkou, Shanghai, I see remnants of Japanese merchants' signs and stalls selling bits and pieces of Japanese goods, and I always feel uneasy. I think to myself that one day, we will completely get rid of these things. I've been in Shanghai for a year now, but I still see shop signs with unwashed-off patterns and characters, and occasionally I see Ajinomoto in food shops and medicines of unknown use in pharmacies. This is also because our compatriots are too lazy to notice these unpleasant signs, or perhaps Japanese merchants left behind too much stock, and not many people are buying it, so it has been selling slowly for years. Who would have thought that after August 15th, these signs and advertisements would still be useful, and the stock would not only not be sold out, but new goods would be shipped in large quantities!</p>
<p>The nights after the start of autumn are indeed much cooler. Those who love to sleep can indulge in sweet dreams. Leaning against the bed frame with a newspaper in hand, my eyes are looking at it, but my mind is vaguely thinking about something. Soon, I no longer know what the words on the newspaper actually are. Suddenly, I returned to my distant hometown. The farmers in the fields were all wearing padded jackets made of cloth from the Nagasaki Osaka Textile Mill, and the village girls had all added large shirts made of flowered calico. I was so surprised that I couldn't even speak. I clearly remembered that my family had written to me, saying that things were too expensive and the times were not peaceful, and they couldn't afford even an inch of cloth, and their clothes were patched and patched to make do. How could this be? But my family wouldn't lie to me. There must be a reason. I couldn't help but ask the second sister-in-law of my old neighbor. Ah, the second sister-in-law sighed before speaking. "Since Japan surrendered, it's been two years. Which family can afford to buy new clothes? Cloth is more expensive than satin. My third child hasn't worn a new piece of clothing since birth. The eldest's are altered for the second, and the second's are altered for the third. Recently, cloth has become cheaper. They say Japanese goods are coming again. Who cares about Japanese or Chinese? I'll buy a couple of feet to patch things up if it's cheap." I felt indescribably uncomfortable after hearing that. Ah, right, I returned home very happy. I saw relatives I hadn't seen for many years. We talked about what had happened since we last met. The older ones had more white hair, and the younger ones had grown half a foot taller. My younger brother used to crawl on the ground, but now he carries a schoolbag. The paper he uses for school is Japanese, the pencils are Japanese, the knives are Japanese, nothing is not Japanese except for the writing brush. How did you all start using Japanese goods? Japan was defeated less than two years ago. Who cares what kind of goods they are? Cheap is good. My younger brother felt he had given me a very clever answer. I was speechless because it was my first day home, and everyone was happy. My grandmother specially made some good dishes for me. On the one hand, it was because I hadn't tasted hometown flavors for many years, and on the other hand, it was because my grandmother cooked them herself. I found them very delicious and repeatedly said how good they were. My grandmother was very pleased and replied, "The vegetables are grown in the garden, very fresh. Adding some 'Ajinomoto' makes them especially flavorful. We haven't been able to buy good 'Ajinomoto' for two years, but now it's available again." I had nothing to say, but I just felt that something was not right.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to the county town two miles from my home to visit relatives. As soon as I entered the city gate, there were many posters on the streets: Dongyangtang, Corporation, Marunouchi, Old Dou Eye Drops, University Eye Drops, and Lieber. It was practically Japan. Except for the tiled houses, everything was filled with Japanese goods. I couldn't bear it anymore. I thought to myself, what is this? I quickly left the road and hastily visited a few relatives. When I returned home, I said that evening that I had things to do in Shanghai and couldn't stay long. My family didn't think much of it, but they couldn't keep me. With a heavy heart, I took the train and then the ship back to Shanghai. Before getting off the ship, I saw an old friend standing on the dock to pick me up. I was delighted. When the ship docked, I rushed off the ship to shake hands and exchange greetings. Only then did I take a closer look at this old friend's attire: a brand-new navy-blue serge suit and a brightly colored tie. I said, "Old Lu, how come you've been so successful recently? Your outfit has been upgraded." Old Lu said, "Don't make fun of me. Before, clothing materials cost over two million, and that was for domestic goods. Good foreign goods cost tens of millions. How could we afford that? Now Japanese wool has arrived, which is much cheaper, so I took the opportunity to get a suit. Don't be surprised. If you look around the market, there are many things that are cheaper. Although money is worthless, Japanese goods are cheaper than other goods." I was truly stunned. I didn't expect Shanghai to have returned to the old days before the victory. I felt very unhappy. I took my luggage, hired a car, and returned to my residence. My sister saw me return and asked about things at home. I spoke somewhat listlessly about some things. The next day, I went to the factory to ask for leave. The factory site was originally in the industrial area. After the victory, there were already many smokestacks not emitting smoke. In the past two years, due to economic instability, some factories had started operating, but many had to close again because they couldn't afford to pay. This time, it was even worse. Many factories had closed, especially some small light industrial factories. They couldn't withstand the impact of Japanese goods dumping and couldn't compete, so they had to close down. I said, "It's over, it's over. Eight years of resistance, all the blood was shed in vain. Is it the fate of the Chinese people to let Japan repeat the disaster of economic invasion once again?" I felt a pang in my heart and burst into tears. Suddenly, I heard my sister call me, "Wake up, what are you dreaming about? Did your girlfriend change her mind again?" I opened my eyes, and the room was brightly lit. I was still holding the newspaper in my hand, and I knew that I had just been dreaming. I couldn't believe that I had such a strange dream, so I told my sister everything. My sister said, "This isn't a dream. Maybe next August 15th, it will be like this. If you don't believe me, go home next year and see. Shanghai will be about the same." But I always hope it's just a dream.</p>

<h3>Naughty Cat Ah Mi (9)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>Film Scene Weekly</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>Satirical Comedy "Fake Phoenixes and Sham Dragons"</p>
<p>Due to the opposition raised by the barbers' union and their demand to ban the film, this "Fake Phoenixes and Sham Dragons" has become known throughout Shanghai. As a result, this dispute has given "Wen Hua" unexpected publicity.</p>
<p>But does this film really insult barbers?</p>
<p>After we watched it, the definite answer is no. The playwright portrays the pair of barbers, Number Three and Number Seven, as kind and simple, while the female lead, Fan Ruhua, is vain and accustomed to luxury. But in essence, she is still a good person. Otherwise, she would not have given up her enjoyment and married "Number Three" in the end. She even joined the Times Barber Shop as a manicurist. All of this demonstrates the value of those who earn their own living, and Fan Ruhua's awakening is the right path for her to take.</p>
<p>However, in terms of scriptwriting techniques, this cannot be considered a top-notch comedy. The scriptwriting seems insufficiently clean and concise, and the director, Zuo Lin, has obviously put in a lot of effort in his handling. However, due to the director's insufficient familiarity with film techniques, many transitions between scenes are relatively awkward, especially the editing is even more inappropriate. On the whole, a new director with such achievements can be considered competent.</p>
<p>Shi Hui and Li Lihua are the two main leads who carry the most weight in the whole play. Shi Hui's acting skills are more skilled, while Li Lihua's appear relatively stiff in comparison. Ye Ming's "Number Seven" is too restrained and rigid. In the entire play, Chen小姐 (Miss Chen) played by Lu Shan and 張太太 (Mrs. Zhang) played by Zhang Wan are the best.</p>
<p>We don't know why "Wen Hua" authorities wanted to use Li Lihua to star in this film? Audiences with good memories probably still remember "Spring River Regret," a collaborative film with the Japanese puppets during the occupation period, the female lead was this very Li Lihua who joined hands with the enemy.</p>
<p>Depressing Psychological Film "Sick Beauty"</p>
<p>Recently, Hollywood has been popular with filming psychological films. This "Sick Beauty" belongs to this type of play. But these so-called psychological films, if strictly speaking, are just superficial psychological analyses, at most, just wanting to change the audience's taste.</p>
<p>"Sick Beauty" is adapted from Darrell Fordson's play. Precisely because the adapter's skills are poor, the entire play is still limited to a residence, and the female lead Yingling, who has mental illness, needs a beautiful and elegant environment for treatment. However, the adapter needs her to focus on disrupting this peaceful family, so that she can develop as much as possible in this house—acting. Therefore, she is just a puppet being led, and the development in terms of reason and emotion is very far-fetched.</p>
<p>The director's handling of this play is also more depressing. The middle scenes are dragged out for too long, so that the transitions in the later scenes are abrupt and slightly uncoordinated. In short, although the director's handling of the play is very meticulous, it is still not brilliant.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Anna Brest's sick beauty Yingling, although trying very hard to act, never really gets into the role. Compared with her other films, this play is relatively inferior. Leif Bremer's painter is steady and refined in his acting, and is very competent.</p>
<p>Not Worth Watching "Little Five Righteous"</p>
<p>This "Little Five Righteous" is produced by a small American film company. Regardless of the script, director, and actors, they are all below standard. Even compared with the most inferior domestic films, such as "Female Spy No. 76" and "Loyal Soul of Interrogation," such a film is no better.</p>
<p>Even the most patient audience cannot finish watching this film.</p>
<p>Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Clarification</p>
<h3>Leaving Behind Thousands of Acres for Ungrateful Descendants: Siblings Divide Property and Cook Each Other in the Pot</h3>
<p>Editor: I have two legal questions, please advise: (1) The deceased Mr. So-and-so had one son and one daughter. The daughter was married before 1927. The deceased died in 1946. Does the married daughter have the right to inherit property? (2) Mr. So-and-so has over a thousand acres of land. In 1939, his married daughter was given some property by her father because of financial difficulties. At that time, his son, relying on his economic pressure, incited his father and daughter to sign a unilateral contract, stating that she would voluntarily waive her right to inherit property. Is this contract valid?</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) Yes, inheritance begins upon the death of the deceased. Under current law, married women have the right to inherit property. (2) No. In the Supreme Court's ruling No. 2652 of 1933, it states: "Although the right to inherit property can be waived by the heir, it must be after he has obtained the right to inherit. Therefore, according to Article 1174, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, the waiver of the right to inherit should be made in writing to the court, family council, or other heirs within two months from the time of knowing that he can inherit. Therefore, the time of waiver must be after knowing that he can inherit, and the so-called knowing that he can inherit must be after the inheritance has begun. Otherwise, if the inheritance has not yet begun, how can one know if he can inherit? If the waiver is made before knowing that he can inherit, it is legally invalid. See also Article 1175 of the same law, which stipulates that the waiver of inheritance takes effect retroactively to the time when the inheritance began. Since it is retroactive, it is clear that the waiver must be after the inheritance has begun, and should not be waived in advance." Furthermore, a gift before the inheritance begins is not sufficient to deprive the recipient of her right to inherit property.</p>
