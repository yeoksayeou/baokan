<p>〔本報南京三日電〕長春危機已過去，長春北進國軍三日午十一時進入德惠。該城上月二十三日被圍，當時共軍兵力共六師，戰車二十餘輛，砲百餘門，實力雄厚，其攻勢展開之初，國軍主力退却，以一部作抵抗，長春附近國軍，旋出動主力，常節節進攻，的於上月二十七日左右，共軍即漸呈動搖之勢，戰鬥至為激烈，卒於三日晨解圍進入德惠城。該城解圍後，東北戰局可暫告停頓，共軍進攻長春大遭頓挫，整個戰果，共軍死近二萬餘，傷萬餘共軍在國軍進迫情形下，自承失敗，終至撤出。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春三日電〕截至目前為止，長春外圍各綫共軍已完全潰敗，所謂林彪之第二次「春季攻勢」被澈底粉碎。在此一戰役中，此問先後共發現共軍十二個戰鬥單位之番號，即第一至七師，十六至十八師及曹里懷所部之松江部隊曁林彪慕幹部隊之三百五十九旅，總數常在十萬以上（前此估計為二十萬人或嫌誇大（。在將近句日之戰鬥中，其重心始終在德惠，圍攻該城之共軍，不下三萬人，據軍方所獲情報，林彪曾限令四日內攻陷德惠，然猛攻八日，亦未奏效，卒於遭受慘痛打擊後，分頭潰退。據悉：國軍追擊部共達七路之多，各綫共軍潰退之方向，大致為在德惠以北者向北，在德喪東南以迄吉長綫一帶者向東北，在德惠西南以迄長洮錢一帶者向西北，比等路綫，仍各為其來犯之路綫。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中共駐滬人員撤退名單於前日提出後，定於明晨七時乘特快車赴京沿途將由警備司令部派員妥為保護。抵京後會同京地中共人員慘至七日由美方派軍用機五架送返延安。至於中共駐行總代表是否亦須同時撤退，軍政當局正向南京請示中。思南路中共辦事處及漢口路新華日報館館址暫時將由各　區　察局負責保管。又據　　司令部某負責人表示：此後如南區內仍有中共秘密工作人員　　搗亂，即將予以逮捕。</p>
<h3>董必武昨赴京　猶圖延緩撤退</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕茲悉，南京中共代表團為限令撤退事，頃函復首都衛戍總部，略稱：「美方協助之空運工具，未能于貴部限定之期內充分撥用，須延至本月七日，如氣候無故障，敝處留京人員眷屬，決於七日飛延。茲特浩就本處留京及南京新華日報工作人員及眷屬名册各一份，交通工具，電台以及手槍淸册各一份，隨函送上，至希查照。至本處交通工具，原係自購之物，擬請託民主同盟代為保管，自衛手槍三架，原為代表佩用。等語。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨主席張君勤氏，昨就中共人員撤退興政府全盤改組等事發表談話稱；中共不承認去年六月以後政府對外所締任何協定，實為促成政府限　共留駐人員撤退之主要原因。國民政府旣為國內國際一致公認之合法政府，自有與任何國家　結條約之權，今中共忽聲明不承認該項條約之法律根據，即等於不承認國民政府之合法地位。由此一端，可見中共顯無與政府最復和談之誠意，中共人員之撤退，實為當然之舉。</p>

<h3>國軍戰鬥力堅強　於挫敗各地共軍攻勢中益獲證明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕陳毅在魯南臨近大敗後，中共為安定內部人心，挽救頹局，發動造謠宣傳戰與濟南近郊及東北方面之大規模攻勢宣傳戰中，揑造中戰果，擴大宣傳，該轉移視綫，混淆聽聞，然其攻勢在濟南方面，迄今仍一籌莫展，攻勢頓挫。東北方面，中共集廿五萬大軍，傾巢進犯，企圖挽回聲譽，擴大叛亂，上月廿日準備完畢，渡松花江南犯，國軍為誘敵深入，予以痛　計，除留置少數兵力於松花江北岸橋頭堡及德惠外，主力逐漸退却，共軍以為得逞，於廿七日竄抵米沙子，萬寶山，小合隆之綫，當時松花江北岸橋頭堡國軍，自二十一起被共軍二十倍以上之兵力　我猛功，仍能沉着應戰，至今屹立未動。德惠方面守軍兩個師，自二十三日起被共　主力六個師附戰車二十一輛，大小火砲百餘門猛烈攻擊，國軍以一當百，反覆衝殺，幾進幾出，前後斃共軍兩萬餘，共軍受此打擊，政勢頓挫，國軍主力自長春以北地區二十八日集結完畢，按照頭定計劃，以雷霆萬鈞之勢，驟予反擊，勢如破竹，共軍傷亡遍野，爭相北竄，遣棄軍實無算。國軍先頭部隊，三日晨進抵總惠，該城之關已解，主力正向北追擊中。共軍準備半年餘之東北攻勢，至此已告粉碎無遺，此役不但使共軍損失慘重，並證明國軍之戰鬥力，足可與二十倍之共軍兵力對戰，並擊破之，此點頗堪注意。</p>

<h3>政府決提早改組　三中全會開幕前可完成　雷震張君勱等晋京洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕中樞人士表示，改組政府計劃，決提早促之實現。一般相信，十五日三中全會開幕前可改組完成。雷震在滬與各黨派商討政府改組計劃，已獲結果，雷氏偕張君勱，左舜生，李璜等四日晨可抵京，與中樞有所商洽。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政協秘書長雷震，昨乘夜車返京。行前告記者，政府不希望僅有青年一黨單獨參加政府，故特奉命來滬邀民社黨代表晋京。該黨大多數常委在京與政府洽商後，希望對全面參加事蔘有所決定。至於南京會談採取何種方式，是否民　兩黨，社會賢達與政府代表共敘一堂，商計全面改組；抑或個別談判，則全由主席決定，本人不能答覆。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨領袖張君勱及留滬各常委，昨晚十一時乘夜車晋京，與當局商討全面改組政府事宜。此行在京擬滯留二三天，必要時可延長。綜合多方面之可靠消息，前日民社黨開常會時，雖有參加政府限於四機構之決定，但如當局能提供取消一黨專政之保證，則該黨之全面參加，不必一定在三中全會之後。據聞；留滬常委中，堅決主張不作進一步參加者居極少數。大部分主張有條件的參加，例如政府能使民社黨參與國防外交財政之機密，使明瞭國事之實際情況等，一般均認為過渡時期財政尚有辦法，而內爭并非因民社黨參加政府而發生者，故加入政府并不致「代人受過」。又張嘉璈氏之南來，對於張君勱氏之態度有相當影響，故當局如能誠意邀請；南京之商談可望有具體收穫。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕政協秘書長雷震國大秘書長洪蘭友兩氏，乘昨晚十一時車返京，同行者有青年黨左舜生，張伯倫，民社黨張君勱，徐傅霖，蔣勻田，萬仭千，馮今白，湯住心，孫寶剛，戢翼翹，盧廣聲，汪士銘等十二人。青年黨李璜氏，因事滯滬，今明日亦將赴京。民青兩黨全體留滬中常委抵京後，將會同兩黨留京中常委，與最高當局就政府進一步改組事，作重要商談。張君勱稱：關於本黨對政府改組之態度，仍與前次參加四機構聲明所述相同。此次赴京，當先聽取政府之意見，再作決定。渠表示在京僅擬躭擱一日，即行返滬，因赴印參加亞洲會議，事前必須作充分之準備。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕民盟昨日決定對張瀾上蔣主席書，不予提出，惟將於日內對外發表聲明，詳述民盟對當前時局之態度。聲明草案，於昨晚由葉篤義携京，徵求民盟留京委員同意後，即可發表。</p>

<p>何應欽將軍勗勉中訓團同學學習中國所亟需之學術，共同實際研究中國之問題，如改進農業等。總之，須利用?時為祖國作有用之服務，并儘量糾正美國人民對中國之錯誤觀念。</p>
<p>何將軍復謂：三中全會將於三月十五日展幕，伊已提出建議，籲請發展中國農業經濟，改進農民生活，實施我黨「耕者有其田」之政策，并以科學方法，實現孫總理之民生主義。</p>
<p>據保應欽將軍語記者稱：渠適知西岸視察歸來，曾考察十四個州之農業狀況，其向三中全會所提出之建議已電南京，共一千字左右，其中重要參考資料，均取材於美農業部之文件。記者詢以對目前魯省戰局之觀察，據謂：目前雖有困難，但深信國軍必能完任務。何將軍稱：在蔣主席領導下，國事前途，必可樂觀。</p>
<p>記者以國防部改組事相詢，據答謂純屬謠言。</p>

<p>在今天下午二時（格林威治標準時間）黃源同盟條約，將在具有歷史意味的鄧扣克地簽立。此一條約的簽立，正在莫斯科外長會議召開的前夕。出席莫斯科會議的法國代表團，為瞭此一條約的簽訂，而延展了他們的莫斯科之行。鄧扣克在世界第二次大戰中，對英法兩國均具深長的意義，而戰後英法同盟條約的簽訂卻就在這個歷史的名城，是此條約的簽訂，對於英法兩國人民必起着一种深刻的交感作用。據報載消息，此一條約約有效期為五十年，其中重要的規定為：（一）如德國採行一种侵略政策，或一切足以危害兩國安全的措施，英法決定彼此間采取協同政策以謀抵制；（二）如英法一方與德作戰，不論為防製德國的侵略，抑或為發行聯合國的安全理事會的決議，另一方必須予以軍事上的協助；（三）如果將來德國不屬行其義務，兩國對於德國的處置，必須取得協議；（四）英法兩國對於彼此間有關之經濟問題，應彼此協議而決定行動。基此四點，可知此次英法同盟約簽訂，其目的實在防制德國的再起；對於此一同盟條約的簽訂我們謹於此申述我們的觀感如次；</p>
<p>我們首須指出的就是若干人士以為此次英法同盟約簽訂，其目的在以結成一種西歐同盟以對蘇。觀乎英法同盟約主要條款，是其目的，與其說是在對蘇實毋寗說是在對德·法德地壤相接，而法國對德作戰在最近三十年來已有兩次；對於它的東鄰，法國始終存着一种畏懼的心理。如今德國之降，鍳於第一次世界大戰的經騐，第四法蘭西對於萊茵河東岸的鄰邦，始終存着戒心：為了要防制是項慘痛經騐的重演，法國的不再遭受德國的侵略，故而有此次英法同盟約簽訂。此其目的與其說在防制蘇聯勢力的再擴張，實毋寗說是防制德國的再起，所以對於此一同盟條約的簽訂，這決不是一種反蘇西歐集團的結合。</p>
<p>法國之對於德國本來是兄弟之邦；在中古查爾曼大帝時代本來法德一家，無分彼此。其後查爾曼大帝崩，德法兩國的歷史於是各奔前程；這其間兩國民族間之情感卻愈趨惡劣。到了今天，法國對德的政策，還是防制了統一而強有力的德國的再生。今日法國對德的政策，還是主張魯爾區與德國的分離，薩爾區與法國的歸併，萊茵河區域的國際化及德國的聯邦化與適當賠款的要求。凡此種種，均在使一個強盛統一的德國之再出現為不可能。英法同盟條約的簽訂，就在防制此一強盛統一德國的再出現。法國之采取此一對德政策以及英國之與法國因此而成立同盟是否為明智得計，我們不欲多論；不過國際條約，特別是同盟條約的簽訂，無疑地，對於簽約國雙方是有利的。否則，此項條約就沒有簽訂的必要。這是在這種相互有利的條件下，我們看見有英法同盟條約的締結。</p>
<p>關於德國的將來，無疑地實是此後歐洲乃至整個世界和平的所繫。此次英法同盟條約的簽訂既以德國為對象；是其意義，我們必須在一個更大的角度下，始能有充分的認識。第一，英法同盟約簽訂，與英蘇同盟及法蘇同盟是相輔的。英蘇法蘇之間本已有同盟關係的存在，而英法為傳統的盟友，卻在此次戰後沒有同盟關係的存在，終究是一件遺憾的事。英法締盟盛倡於兩年以前，當時英法的關係為了敘利亞近東問題頗現緊張。此次同盟約簽訂，補足了缺落的一環，實為眾所期望的事。第二，如今英法蘇三強之間既有同盟關係的存在，而此項同盟約目的又在對德，我們深信必更進一步而有導使英法美蘇對德協定成立的可能。美國雖則不是一個歐洲的國家，但美國卻為了歐洲的局勢面參加了兩次世界大戰；對於德國的局勢，美國自不便旁觀。因此，在莫斯科會議召開的前夕，而將英法同盟成為一宗既成事實，在某一意義下，實足以促進英法美蘇對於歐洲局勢的成立協定。在戰時艱難困苦情形下的合作，到了敵人崩潰後的今日，應該更應有更進一步的合作纔能凝固戰時的盟誼。</p>
<p>在這個意義下，我們感覺到遺憾的是對於日本戰時的盟邦還沒有進一步合作以凝固戰時盟誼的跡象；且其中或不免有若干盟邦甚至在扶植戰後新興日本的抬頭。歐洲的多邊同盟，其目的既在對德，為什麼在亞洲，我們在戰時的盟邦，不能有像歐洲那樣的戰後發展？在歐洲，我們應該防制戰後德國的再起；難道我們不應在亞洲防制戰後日本的再起？在歐洲，我們看見有兩國間的締盟進而有四強協定的可能；在亞洲，我們不亦應該援歐陸的成例，成立同盟，進而有多邊的協定，以防制戰後日本的再起，我們是一個亞洲的國這，對於戰後日本的再起，自然關切尤深。在中英，中美，中蘇之間，我們似應該都分別訂立同盟；進而有中蘇英美之間的多邊協定。二十世紀既有太平洋世紀之稱，是太平洋和平的維繫，關係世界前途的安危，其意義尤為重大，在聯合國機構下，本可有區域的協定，與聯合國機構的精神，本不抵觸。我們願由於英法同盟約簽訂及歐洲局勢的推移；我們的外交當局對於亞洲的局勢，特別是對於戰後的日本，也能采取同樣的主動。</p>
<p>可是我們於此有不能不一言的，就是條約的簽訂，其最重的一部，還是在此後對於條約義務的如何履行。第一次世界大戰後，緊接着又有一個極盛的條約簽訂時期。然而當時所訂的條約，其能有忠實履行條約義務者又幾希：此次英法同盟條約的簽訂，是否能有預期的結果，還得看將來它的條約義務是否能忠實履行。此次英法同盟條約的簽訂，在法國國會雖得到熱烈的支持，但巴黎的一般觀察家卻還懮慮共黨對於此一條約簽訂的反對。對於德國及西歐是否此後英法能有協同的步調，還得看此後此一條約所規定的義務的是否將忠實履行。但無論如何，有條約總比沒有條約好多。這是在此一意義下，我們對於英法同盟條約的簽訂，表示欣慰。</p>

<h3>莫斯科會議斯近　歐陸小國均予重視</h3>
<p>〔聯合社瑞典京城二日電〕歐洲諸小國現均全力注視莫斯科會議，此種感覺在瑞典尤爲強烈，官方人士深信第三次大戰如再發生，則瑞典一如第二次大戰時殆無保守中立之機會。蘇聯與西方列強發生外交衝突時，瑞典政策乃以中間路綫處以其間，尤以通商爲然。瑞典政府不顧美官方恐懼蘇聯勢力滋長而作之批評，承認去年與蘇聯所訂商約及瑞蘇有關係逐漸改善，極表欣慰，決意避免成爲任何強國之附庸。但若東西雙方繼續疏遠，此在東方地理而兼西文習俗之國家，欲求避免附庸，頗匪易事。職是之故，此間外交當局咸認爲歐洲諸小國之命運，胥視華府、倫敦、莫斯科三寺間能否保持均勢而定。瑞典人民易生恐怖，可於一端見之，即去年夏季之神秘火箭是，關於火箭消息，當局現幾巳全部披露。據美國公認之報告，瑞典上空發現火箭八百枚以上，但有資格方面稱，軍事專家詳義調查結果，顯示不致超過該數百分之三至五，且從會如此，亦無飛越瑞典上空之確實證據，因未發現碎片之故。但此類恐怖傳說，給予瑞典人民以新式戰爭之未來景象，連同原子武器驚人破壞威力之知識，使彼等深信欲求中立惟有賴於世界和平。</p>

<h3>華僑富商的家鄉　檳榔嶼巡禮</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>所有遠東的都市大都具有一處出名的特點。檳榔嶼，是馬來半島西岸一個清潔而繁榮的海口，素以華僑富商的家鄉着稱於世。</p>
<p>行是英國人掃募華工來此，在橡皮園和錫礦中工作。現在此輩克勤克儉的華工自己繼有許多田園和錫鑛，而且變成馬來的領袖商人了。</p>
<p>住在這裏掄僑富商究有多少人，雖無從知道，可是你在西郊所見到的精美的住宅，大都是中國鑛業巨　，田園證人或富商的産業。</p>
<p>在日軍佔領時期，華僑大都避居馬來內地，現在又回他們的老家了。目前馬來各地土匪猖獗，富有的華僑時被綁架，他們爲安全計，紛紛移居於此，因爲在檳榔嶼華僑受當地軍警的保護，可以避免被綁的危險。</p>
<p>檳榔嶼中尚有新加坡出名，但是在英國殖民史上佔有重要的一頁，而且擁有蘇彜士運河以西年代最長久的英文報紙。</p>
<p>現在這裏的貨運情形又擁擠起來了。出口貨的數量月有增加，不久便可達到戰前的數字。生橡皮是主要的出口貨，檳榔嶼所輸出的汽車胎，其數量在東南亞方面僅次於新加坡。</p>
<p>檳榔嶼商業區中商店櫛比，貨物山積，大半是華僑和印度人開設的。貨價雖高，蛤品質較遠東其他各地爲優。戰前從中國輸入的絲綢，精美的工藝品和美麗的寶石，售價比較新加坡爲低廉，在新加坡那裏所有好的東西都被大隊佔領軍所吞噬了。</p>
<p>這裏多的是水菓和蔬菜，但是卻鬧着米荒，這是民間的最大痛苦。配給米每磅祇售二分，但是大人每天配給四盎斯，兒童每天配給二盎斯，是不夠的。黑市米每磅售價達五角之鉅。食糖並無配給，必須求諸黑市，售價是每磅一元二角五分。</p>
<p>檳榔嶼在戰事初期即被日軍佔領，但是戰爭所遺留的傷痕並不多，倒是聯合國轟炸機所致的損害比較日軍爲大。當地的煉錫廠—遠東二大煉錫廠之一—成爲美國空中堡壘的軍事目標，而遭炸毀。</p>
<p>檳榔嶼是東南亞最優美的假期遊覽勝地之一，在馬來內地或熾勢的新加坡感到生活單調厭倦的歐洲和中國人，時常到這裏來遊玩。</p>

<h3>沙遜大厦擒「洋老虎」　破大黑市機關　抄出大宗美鈔以及黃金港幣　主犯荷人解警備部收押候究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令部稽查處，昨日在南京東路沙遜大厦二樓一一八號新　洋行內，（前美國新聞處辦公室原址）破獲一大規模經營黑市外匯及美鈔黃金之秘密機關，亦即造成此次金潮之幕後「老虎」之一。當塲抄獲之美鈔共達三十三萬二千一百十一元，此外尚有港幣二萬元，黃金三十八大條以及全部賬册匯票存根等甚多。主犯係一荷蘭籍僑民，名梅伯克（Fredrik　Mysberg）年五十五歲，亦同時在該處就逮。</p>
<p>緣該秘密機關對外名稱為Abis．Co，係向美國政府註册，專營黑市外匯·美鈔·港票·英鎊·黃金等買賣，每日進出，動輒法幣數億元之鉅。其往來客戶中外商人均有一共六十餘家。此次金潮中，該公司曾於事前大量搜購美鈔達二百餘萬元，一面即對外宣傳，謂政府外匯業已告罄，今後需要外匯者，必須以美鈔購買。商人一時不明眞相，紛紛向黑市求取，該公司遂即乘機拉抬，造成空前未有之驚人價格，事後該公司美鈔項下竟盈餘達美金八十餘萬元。惟好景不常，自我政府實施經濟緊急措施後，該公司即無法再行從事投機操縱。</p>
<p>詎不數日，該公司又死灰復燃，竟繼續秘密經營外幣及黃金外匯之買賣。蓋該公司在美尚設有分行，同時在本埠以黑市價格收購美軍軍部所發之支票藉以套匯，獲取鉅利。卒為我警備部稽查處獲悉，於昨日上午十時經處長陶一珊複查屬實，呈准宣司令後，即赴中央銀行外匯稽核處，與林處長會商步驟，並由該處派稽核員任垓，徐人驥二人，會同於下午三時開始行動，由督察長路　親率第一稽查大隊長吳潤蓀，大隊附唐與元，分隊長張漢元，金蘇華，外事組長趙廣祿，副督察長程亦川等馳往將該大厦二樓各出入口及電話總機等予以監視，然後衝八一一八號房間。</p>
<p>時該處聚有數十人，正在進行秘密交割手續，見警員突至，莫不驚惶失色，惟當時僅抄獲美鈔二一一一元。迨該公司經理梅白克就逮後，在經理室內復抄獲美鈔卅三萬元，港票二萬元，金條卅八根，以及重要帳册，匯票存根等大批。當塲由路督察長命梅白克包封後簽字點交中央銀行任徐兩稽核員帶返保管。同時該公司尚有重要職員（西人）二人亦一併帶部偵訊。</p>
<p>依據賬册記載，該公司尚存有法幣大宗。昨日破獲之前不久，即有六億元解八荷蘭銀行。同時該梅白克就逮時，態度從容，並要求警員勿使與本案無關之錢鈔牽涉在內。蓋該公司尚有保險箱數只，據稱係客戶寄存者。警員准其所請，在帳目米查明前，會同中央銀行予以封存。</p>
<p>梅白克押赴警備部後，已暮色蒼茫，該公司之西籍法律顧問二人前往要求保釋，卒為該部拒絕。同時該部已請會計師一人澈夜開始查閱帳册。至外傳該公司對外曾利用新豐洋行名義作為掩護一點，則尚待查賬完竣，始可分曉。</p>
<h3>勞資評斷會議决　差額貼補制細則　婚喪給假辦法修正通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勞資評斷委員會，昨日下午假社會局會議室舉行第八次會議。出席吳開先，潘公展，張維，杜月笙（朱文德代），宣鐵吾（黃東昇代），水祥雲，黃仁貴，佘敬成，吳蘊初（田和卿代）。列席李劍華，劉靖　，樊振邦等。因生活指數凍結後，二月份實行差額貼補制度，規定每名貼補七萬三千元。各工廠公會甚為關懷，紛紛請求社會局解釋。惟因無統一辦法，恐以後引起糾紛，故商討決定加工等發給差金辦法，細則為：（一）件工，無論工人生產量之多寡，概以工作日數作為發給差金之標準。（二）童工（包括學徒藝徒養成工等，）凡已免費供給膳食者，其米油鹽煤之差金不予發給，祗發給布糖兩項。凡不供膳者，給予三分之一差金。（三）職工請請假工資照扣者，其差金比例照扣。但病假不扣差金。此外，習慣上向不扣除工資者，差金亦不扣除。（四）各工廠公司行號解雇職工，依照評斷會辦法發給遺散費者，應自二月份起將差金併入工資內發給之。（五）延長工作時間以及臨時加工，不再發給差金。（六）各廠過去免費發給食米者，差金中食米一項不予扣除。（七）工資多寡差金不加區別。另西服時裝等業工人在旺月淡月及停工等情形下，差金應如何發給，尚待研究。</p>
<p>次討論本市工廠工人配偶及直系親屬婚喪給假辦法，經修正通過，待分呈市政府及社會部核准後施行。其要點為（一）本人婚假得請假五天，子女婚假得請假二天，父母及配偶之喪假得請假五天。（二）路程較遠者，另給路程假。其日期由廠方酌量之。（三）請假期內工資照給。（四）論件給資工人得參照本辦法規定辦理。（五）各工廠在本辦法未施行前已定有婚喪給假辦法者，仍照原辦法實行。（六）臨時工及包工均不適用本辦法。</p>
<p>同時並通過某他議案二起：（一）美光火柴廠因調動職員張椿華工作，引起糾紛，不服社會局處分案，議決請水祥雲與黃仁貴佘敬成三委員加以勸導接受。（二）美光火柴廠解僱肺病工人陸永瑞案，議決：依照工廠法發給等於一個月預告期之工資。依和解筆錄給予退職金並發給三個月工資之救濟金。</p>

<h3>參會兩小組硏究結果　市財政無法平衡　不敷達二千餘億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會預決算及財政委員會，為討論市府卅六年度預算問題，昨日下午三時特舉行聯席會議，由趙棣華任主席，到兩組委員及市府各局主管人員約三十人。席間由李文杰報告目前預算統計謂，預算收入方面，市府原列經常門一·四三九億餘元，臨時門一七九億餘，經預算委員會一再討諭逐項增加，最多可增五一八億九千五百餘萬元，則總收入為二·一三八億九千餘萬元。歲出方面原列二·五八七億七千三百餘萬元，其中包括生活補助費，但目前物價漲之又漲，市府各局提出追加數共一八四一億一千六百餘萬元，再加兵役費一億五千餘萬元，則總支出為四·四三〇億餘元。歲出入不敷共為二·二九一億六千餘萬。而經各組委員會視察各局及局方報告審核後，咸認歲出部門實難再行减少，各局編制亦已盡其經濟之能事，故歲出人不敷如何彌補，慶再請討論。經討論結果決定新兵征集所可減少二所，國民兵訓練隊可減少二十二隊（均減半數），則可減省經費約二十餘億元。但其他各項支出一時無法逐一決定減省。又養務勞動代役金無法律根據，決不能征收，故此四百億不列入。目前僅能將市府建設捐二八九億再予考慮，議決俟提出大會討論。又對市府各局處請迨加預算案，決議：在量入為出原則下，請市政府重編本年度歲出預算。</p>

<h3>吳市長茶會招待參議員　希望合理範圍內　增加市政府稅收　潘議長提議市政捐可加考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長昨日下午五時假逸國大飯店舉行茶會，招待本市參議員，到潘議長·徐副議長·市參議員及各局首長約二百人。</p>
<p>吳市長即席致詞，略稱：本人於剛接任時即謂在六個月後本市經濟將不景氣，此言現果不虛，一九四七年確為最困難之一年，本人代表市府同人之意，吾等以為若在此時期能辭職照准，乃是交了好運氣，如免職則是小運氣，第三件即不能說了。</p>
<p>預算不能解決　市政無法施行</p>
<p>吾人辦事，應人愈少而行政效率愈好，故本人初來時即裁减人員頗多，但十個人的事而沒有十側人做，則無法辦事，故不能减者實不可強减。市參議會各組委員會曾視察市府各機構，本人極為贊同，希望能儘量貢獻意見，有裁减必要者，本府決當遵照辦理。關於預算問題，深覺抱歉，蓋不幸近來物價暴漲，當初擬就預算，現難收支平衡，致勞財政，預算委員會一再商討謀取解決辦法。但希望市參戰會多負些責任，准許市府在合理範圍內增加稅收，如最低之預算不能照准，則由任何人來主持市政，恐亦無法施政。</p>
<p>潘議長致答詞關鍵全在物價</p>
<p>繼由潘議長致答詞，略謂預算問題確為一難題，在此物價不穩定之際，本人敢謂無三個月以上之預算可編，更談不到一年。其所以困難之關鍵全在物價。管制物價本可靠按術或方法，但國庫預算不能平衡，物價即無法可管。日前中央頒布經濟緊急措施方案，最要者亦為平衡收支。欲抑平物價，即須視平衡國庫收支做到如何程度，此事非市府所能為力，亦非市參議會可盡力者。但在無法之中求辦法，則唯有將市府收入重行估計，並請市府各主管預算及財政長官，應將實在可收之數，儘量貢獻，勿予隱蔽，寗可於不得己時，再行追加預算，蓋中央方面亦可提出追加。</p>
<p>市長如大包工議員應予協助</p>
<p>吾人不願在此時期浪費財力或舉辦新事業，但應用者則不能不用，舊有事業亦不得不予以維持。現佔計市府收支不平衡數達二千三百億，吾人僅能量入為出，故不得不提出市政建設捐一項，請予考慮。大會如能決議通過，則吾人可請市府根據此數再編預算。說一笑話，即請市長為大包工，指揮一切，市參議員則當負責向市民解釋市府之困難，盡力協助進行。</p>
<p>旋由徐副議長，徐參議員永祚等相繼發言，贊同市府征收市政建設捐，並解釋當前困難。</p>

<h3>本市首批徵兵人數　不致超過三千五百</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海師管區司令部成立以來，對於舉辦常備兵役及國民兵役之各項訓練工作，均經積極籌備就緒，國防部發下之官兵被服，亦已運到。該部所員上海團管區，下設兩大隊，共十中隊，等候徵集員兵入伍受訓。據該部負責人預計，第一期徵集人數最多不致超過三千五百人，惟實應徵集人數，年齡及時間，迄今尙未接奉國防部明白指示。在兵役行政方面，市府民政處短期內即將成立軍事科，各區保設區保隊附，是項幹部給須一千三百餘人。該部已向民政處建議，可就復員軍官，靑年軍及中訓國行政班團員中羅聘之。昨日該部陳參謀長並就此事與張處長有所商談。據悉：市政府為設置軍事科及區保隊附所作之預算，將提出參議會討論。</p>
<h3>三工會要求解凍指數吳局長勸勉共渡難關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三區機器業，絲織業及六區機器業等三職業工會，昨推派代表卅餘人至總工會請願，提出要求兩點：（一）將物價抑平至一月份時之價格。（二）將生活指數解凍。因水理事長適往社會局參加勞資評斷會議，彼等乃轉往社會局請願。待勞資評斷會議結束，由吳局長接見，職工代表呈上正式公文，並要求如指數不能解凍，則希望將配售實物之種類加多。吳局長表示：又職工生活之困苦，甚為明瞭，所提要求決代轉呈上峯。但望職工能瞭解政府困難，同舟共濟以渡此難關。政府實行經濟緊急措施，此一時期希望不長。政府卽將生活指數凍結，一定盡力抑平物價。如不能做到抑平，則不會單使工人吃虧，在凍結生活指數後，一定另有補救辦法。工人合理之要求，本人一定代為爭取云。因人多意見紛雜，吳為長定今日下午再約該三工會代表顧剛，沈默，談富根談話，聽取意見。</p>
<p>對總工會要求工人之生活指數每三月調整一次，吳局長表示當代為轉呈中央。</p>

德將球拍出，但敵鋒圍門而攻，在混亂中，被搶回一隻，上半時一對一和局。　　一球決勝　　休息過後，風勢突轉，向　島門前急吹，國產球迷皆為星島危。開賽後，廣森得球，單刀赴會，沿邊切中，但在禁區為地亞推倒，球證視若無覩，失去機會。　　再一次，兆榮接得金海來球，指門猛奔，也在禁區被非法截擊，球證又不理，觀衆嘩然。　　直到二十分鐘後，金海領軍再進，本欲將球高傳右方，地亞躍頂，球落金海脚前，「三郎」斜交兆榮，但見「佛爺」脚頭起處，球由左角滾進，二比一，星島再度領前。　　此後風勢更急，星島被迫退守，金兵利用大脚傳中，急衝門法作戰，迫成角球達七次，幸星島後守諸將，全有超越演出，得保勝局。在萬千球迷歡呼下，擊倒金兵，將於四月十一與南華爭奪冠軍。</h3>

<p>中央銀行新總裁　張嘉璈昨日就職　勗勉同人繼續努力共渡難關　　〔本報訊〕中央銀行新總裁張嘉璈，業於日前下午十一時許，自京抵滬。昨日下午三時許，即赴中央銀行就事視事。當由前總裁貝祖治迎往總裁室，即舉行節單之交替儀式，並召集各局處主管晉見，由張總裁致致訓詞，略謂：貝總裁主持中央銀行，雖爲時不久，而此一年間，適承戰事結束之後，百廢待舉，在財政金融困難之際，苦心支持，實堪欽敬。目前中央銀行丁此艱困之會，亟待同人繼續過去服務之精神，共渡難關等語。旋由貝前總裁致詞，略謂：張總裁爲我國財政經濟金融界傑出人才，以目前之環境而論，惟張總裁足以克服當前種種困難。就國家利益言，深慶得人，就本人言，此實爲減除本人困苦之救星。繼由副總裁陳行致詞，略謂：在此金融動盪之際，無論從任何方面着想，均應竭誠擁擠國策。吾行同人，尤應在張總裁指導之下，努力服務，共濟服務，共濟艱危。致詞既畢，新舊兩總裁旋即交接印信，儀式宣告完成。　　四時許，茶會開始，新舊兩總裁步出總裁室。是時合機關首長，及中外金融界領袖，亦巳紛紛到達致賀，當由新舊兩總裁及央行各局處主管招待至央行三樓會議室茶敘。昨日出席者有孔祥熙、潘公展、徐寄廣、徐柏園、何德奎、趙曾鈺、趙祖康、李度、丁貴堂、劉丙彜、王曉籟、李馥蓀、陳光甫、錢永銘、趙棣華、劉攻芸、程滄波、宋漢章、徐學禹等六十餘人。張總裁旋對各報社記者發表就職之局面談話如次爭取經濟自由　　回憶自民廿五離開中國銀行，任職中央以來，倏忽巳逾十載。今日重來服務金融，與各界老友，得有承教機會，心中實覺無窮忻快。但才輇任重，希望社會賢達，金融領袖，不吝匡正，尤所昐切。　　我國家經過八年抗戰，幸賴賢明領袖領導於上，四萬萬同胞協力同心，犧牲奮鬥於下，得有最　之勝利。唯獨立的國家，與獨立的國民，必須爭取二種不可分　的自由：一爲政治的自由，一爲經濟的自由。抗戰勝利之日！就是我國家與人民得到政治的自由之日。但是經濟尚未鞏固，元氣尚未恢復。人民生活不獨尚未安定，且大有皇皇然不可終日之勢。就是經濟的自由幸福，尚未得到，須有賴於吾同胞以與抗戰同樣的精神，來爭取此人人不可一日或缺的自由，以達到真正的勝利。克服通貨膨脹　　通貨膨脹，爲戰爭中必有之現象。戰爭以後，整理通貨，必須經過一極痛苦的過程。第一次大戰後，許多國家不乏先例。及此次大戰，許多有第一次經驗的國家，用種種預防方法，來減少通貨膨脹的危險，又不具備預防的基本條件，以致有今日的經濟現象。　　歐美各國預防通貨膨脹危險的方法，就是一面管制物價，實行配給，扶助生産，節約消費。一面提高所得稅率，提倡儲蓄，增募公債，以吸收人民之過剩購買力。因此財政收支，物資供求，雖在通貨膨脹之中，而仍能保持平衡。而陽須值得吾們注意者，其成功之關鍵，在乎人民與政府真誠合作。政令愛護人民，人民領事政府。中國如欲逃出通貨膨脹的危險與痛苦，仍不能不經過歐美各國所經過之過程。何況吾國抗戰雖巳勝利，國內和平秩序尚未完全恢復。最近中央頒布之經濟緊急措施，即本歐美各國之戰時經濟政策，希望吾全國同胞，人人此爲導入於經濟穩定不可避免之過程。其成功之關鍵，全在人民與政府之互信互助，惟誠合作。圖片　張總裁就職時與前總裁貝祖治合影表現自治能力　建立金融中心　　上海市塲，爲無數刻苦耐勞勤奮干練的青年店員職工，在有守有爲的領袖先進指導下，血汗所造成，極有悠久光榮之歷史。加以邇年國家法權，業巳完整，正吾市民表顯自治能力之日。希望吾輩不特努力保持巳有之光榮歷史，且進一步共圖建立一有組織有秩序有道德經委的金融中心與商業市塲。所有爾欺我詐，豪取強壓，以及一切投機暴利的不良風氣，一律予以矯正剷除，以爲全國之倡。果能如是，則正當之生産事業與國際貿易，自必欣欣向榮。而上海不獨可成爲全國商業樞紐，更可進而爲國際金融之重心。中央銀行負調劑全國金融之使命，處此經濟難關，責任更爲艱鉅。嘉璈瞻念前途，深恐未能勝任。所幸本行曆屆總裁，　劃有方。在職同人，又能勤慎服務。惟有秉以往爲大衆服務之精神，聊盡爲政府與人民合作之橋樑中一分子之責。尤望各界領袖，及友邦知好，時時不吝予以指導協助，俾免損越，感甚幸甚。人事並無更動　　記者旋向張總裁提出問題若干，當承解答，茲摘錄如次，渠稱：渠昨日初任新職，對央行若干局處主管提出辭呈，及繼任之副總裁人先事，均尚未考慮及之。惟渠並未携帶任何新人任職，故亟望人事勿有更動。至輸入管理委員會執委會主委，及輸出推廣委員會執委會主委亟職，按條例規定，係中央銀行總裁兼任，故旁須兼任。欲解工商困苦　必須抑低利率　　〔本報訊〕財政部次長徐柏圖，昨答記者之詢問，茲分誌大要如次：（一）今後金融問題中心，仍在利率之抑低。目前如欲解除工商界對高利貸之困苦，勢須發放貸款。惟發放貸款後，又須顧慮勿使流入投機囤積之途徑，致失貸款願意。深信張總裁主持中央銀行後，可望覓取適當辦法，抑低利率。（二）關於銀樓業請求維持飾金之買賣，及核准行莊請求准許開業兩案，雖均有其苦衷在，惟政府法令既定，勢須切實行。現擬在兩者之間，覓求解決之道云。市塲盛傳「禁做」消息　華股狂漲之風稍挫　（警備部調查對敲號家帳冊）　　華股昨雖漲而極爲混亂，恍惚不定，熱股漲度過甚，一有外來打擊，堅後急回，午後尚因籌碼干涸而多蠶動，但禁做說盛，終以低價結束。　　晨開　買氣甚熾，水泥新亞漲停，開後一四五號六一號二一七號二二四號一八六號九上號二一五叼均有買進，遞永紗步漲到二八八〇元。七六號一四五號二〇七號雖賣到二八三〇元景福及遞信和首先漲停，八五號一九九號一〇六號及散買均納遞永紗升至二九四〇元。二一八號七六號賣出，退至二八三〇元。一七一號二二三號一九七號等進至二九〇〇元。七六號七九號一七一號忽又賣到二七九〇元，二三五號二二四號二一一號四號一五四號紛進，又起買風，一五二號，一九八號力進，十時半遞永紗乃漲到二九六〇元左右。此時傳大戶洪某在塲外力售，並有美匯減低之謠，立起跌風，二三一號一七九號入九號二一九號九一號八五號七六號一三九號一二五叼八三號二號一一二號紛紛脫手而降至二六六〇元。因聞債市被警局驅散，以及對敲號被查帳等訊也。三號等銀行幫真低維持，六八號亦時，升至二八二〇元。一四二號八五號六五號七六號一一二號再賣到二六九〇元，三一號二二三號二一一號一四五號一七一叼均進至二八〇〇元外。惟因塲外有只做了結之說，浮多有了，午收平盤。結果較上週六收計永紗勤興中法微升，信和新光華豐升關志，景福漲一成，美亞跌半成，新華微九。遞交永紗信新光微升，華豐升半成，美亞微降，冷股景綸漲停，中絲商務水泥漲一成左右，內衣跌一成，餘榮辱俱微。　　午後　一四號二一五號七八號等有納，上遞交升爲二八〇〇元。二三一號七六號一四一號二二三號趁高掊手，退至二七二〇元，一八六號二一五號八五號二一九號一四五號九九號一五二號一四二號九一號一八〇號二二四號二二三叼俱進，景福首先漲停，而將遞交拉高至二九三〇元。一三九號一八六號一七一號八二號二三五號一三九號脫手而降至二八〇〇元光景，傳禁做塲外及遞交之說，人心怯疲，二二四號八三號九一號一〇〇號一五二號七八號一二一號八四號等紛紛脫售，散賣更股，降至低價結束。收後更跌至二五五〇元以下。結果較上週六計永紗信和勤與中法微跌，新華美亞跌一成泡影，華豐微升，新光升半成，景福漲一成。遞交永紗信和微挫，華豐新光微升，美亞跌一成弱，冷股中絲景輪漲停，商務水泥漲一成泡影，內衣跌半成強，餘者升降俱微。塲外各股略形穩定，對敲號家貼息開高至三角以外。食油如再超過議價　決下令停止交易　吳市長來信取締黑市　　〔本報訊〕荳油價格，前經議定爲每撥二十五萬元，昨市塲價連桶每擔達卅二萬元。按第一油桶可盛油三擔半，其合理價爲每隻六萬至十二萬元。今商人以油桶價高爲藉口，每擔高達卅二萬元，如以此計算，油桶價值每隻達二十四萬元，無異變相將油價提高。昨社會局糧食科長吉明齋，請示吳市長如何處置，當經決定，如今日仍此情形，將下令停止交易。吉科長告記者稱：此舉與民食方面並無影響。蓋中植廠每日配出七百擔，價每斤二千七百元，民營廠每日配出五百擔，按之本市每月需要三萬六千擔算，足可供應云。　　昨日油市來貨稀少，人心向榮。早市猛跳，收市回跌。生油軋升萬元，豆油回漲一萬三五千元，清油挺昂三五千元，蔴油狂漲一二萬殛。豆餅去胃冷淡，回低五百元。米市去化平常　　昨南北米市共到一萬三千石左右，南市早緊午懈，結果平平。北元陰元見挺升一二千元，秈米挺定。黃豆東北來源湧旺，市化清淡，下挫一二千元。　　麵粉配粉尚未出貨，麩皮大包鄉銷活絡，挺進三五百至千元不一，小包去化不動，　跌千元，大小包背道而馳。　　菉豆高定次削，芝蔴立定，生仁連日猛跌之後，物極思反，本待客幫乘巧納取，轉升三五千元。赤豆亦加二三千元，紅糧高貨帶升一二千元，中關平平。蠶豆仍疲，苞米北洋幫依然暢吸，價格步高飛騰五六千元。查禁對敲　　昨晨市警察局行政處處長方志超，派遣金鈔組組長徐幼祚，及干員十餘人，分赴鑫泰，樂茂等十餘家證券字號，勸諭切勿經營是項非法交易，聞今後警局將隨機而動，俾做一日和尚撞一天鍾澈底查禁塲外對敲交易，以平股市云。統債洋股齊回　　公債昨初倘後回，統丙晨開九五〇〇元，高價升至一〇〇〇〇元外，後以當局干涉之故，一一九室六〇四室均售，退至八三〇〇元結束，收後間市減低少許，結果較上週六計跌五百元，甲乙升一百元，戊挫三百元，成交約五百萬元。　　外股昨初高繼回，亦隨禁做影響，怡紗晨開二〇五〇〇元，高價二〇八〇〇元，後回小至一八七〇〇元，而後盤旋洋商及廣幫均進，證券幫有售，成交見旺，結果較上週六計均見微挫。紗市雖有限價　人心仍多看漲　　昨日紗市續趨堅挺，客銷仍未見暢，然業中人心思高昂，雖格於當局限價，仍漲上三五萬元。津幫已經止辦，中型紗漲勢巳戢，特雙馬會一度衝出四百大關，成交四〇五萬，旋於收市復回三九五萬，頗有欲漲乏力之況。　　中國紡建公司昨循例代紡管會售紗，共售二七五二件，內廠商二〇八九件，號家六六三件。申請戶數共一三一九戶，內廠商七三六戶，號家五八三戶。一月份本市行莊　存欵總數調查　　央行稽核處編審科頃發表一月份上海市二六七家活期存欵定期，存款及西藏實收準備金總額，對一月份活期存款總數爲法幣二八五、五三一、一三五、九八九元，赤一二、九六〇、一三〇、四七七元，本期央行實收準備金總額爲法幣四四、一二八、五二三、一七二元。社局抑平糖價　明日召開審議會　　市社會局爲消弭食糖黑市起見，特定本週三（五日）下午二時召開　價審議會，商討應付辦法，又最近因食糖産地成本激增，市價亦高於滬地，故對食糖配價，將再酌予提高。現聞九次台糖，巳定本月六日開配。糖市初緊後輭　　昨糖市初緊後輭，升降互見。公會劃盤二四粗白初爲二十三萬五千元，後爲二十二萬八千元。秘魯細砂上午到過二十二萬二千元，後爲二十一萬五六千元，下午更降至二十萬〇九千元至二十一萬元。號貨有油幫開出提莊者十三萬三四千元，順德寗十三萬二千元至十三萬元，十二萬九千元。棉赤十五萬元，計三百包之譜。海南赤五十包，十三萬五千元。慶元片青十萬〇五千元，建幫刁寗十二萬七千元，計二百五十包。輿化白二十一萬元至二十萬〇七八千元。輿赤十四萬八九千元，計三百餘篡。核准復業行莊　準備訪華團請願　　〔本報訊〕本市巳核准復業而尚未正式開業之行莊，及鴻康興記，鴻泰，福泰，衡九，宏昶，富源等六錢莊，昨日特召開聯席會議，出席各行莊負責人康來文，黃葆康，高蔭嘉等多人。當決議籌組上海市核准行莊請願團，一面陸續登記同類之行莊，聞共有十餘家之多，共商救濟辦法。目前方針，擬先上呈向行政院訴願，同時再爭取社會及輿論之同情呼籲。　　昨據該請願團某負責人語記者：財部此次對核准復業行莊之開設，以在本年二月廿六日以前業巳開業爲限。而開業則指業巳向財部呈報開業者，始認爲巳有業務發生。然查各核准之行莊，雖尚未加入飄揚交換所，惟一經財部核准後，即積極籌備，覓取行址，招請職員，所耗開辦費極鉅，而內部則實巳發生業務。故「開業」兩字之解釋，實待研究。同時亦望政府頒行限止禁令時，應先完成立法程序並予各行莊以若干考慮霎時間。今一紙禁令，即使各行莊遭受重大損失，所個職工，盡告失業。據渠估計：設各核准行莊能告復業，至少亦可吸收游資一百億元云。　　〔又訊〕正大銀行顧竹淇，匯豐餘銀號章人偉，均祥錢

<p>城門失火殃及池魚　法越交惡華僑受累  西貢二月二十日航訊　鄭伯麟　　目今世界上最不幸的是中國人，尤其不幸的是越南華僑。中國沒有和平，越南也沒有和平。中國戰事，在擎退破壞份子搗亂份子的觀點上，也許可以解釋為「壯士斷臂」的戰爭，越南戰事對於華僑，却純粹是「城門失火殃及池魚」，無辜受累。　　自從法越在河內發生衝突以後，越南全境都陷於恐怖狀態中，只有柬埔寨和老撾兩個王國還是安居樂業，不受戰爭的影響。要明瞭這一點，必須知道越南其實是一個聯邦國，由東京（通稱北圻），安南（中圻），交趾支那（南圻），柬埔寨（又稱高棉或金邊），和老撾（寮國）五部份合成；柬埔寨和老撾是王國，各有王帝；安南本來也是王國，現在則正和東京，交趾支那合組越盟共和國，其構成民族是安南民族，文化和中國非常接近，尤以柬京人在學術及工商業上均占優勢，也是越盟約發源地。越盟約原文是Viet-Minn，是越南同盟約意思，有些中國報紙譯為維明，是譯音的錯誤。柬埔寨和寮國戰前是法國的保護國，戰後也安安穩穩的繼續做保護國，因此沒有流血，沒有戰爭，也沒有自由。　　槍聲·舞影　判若兩個世界　　記者於聖誔節時曾由西貢赴柬埔寨京城一行，由西貢乘長途汽車赴東京，全程僅需一日，路途很不太平，因為離開西貢約三十公里，就是越盟黨人的勢力範圍，長途汽車時遭槍擊。近兩月來，焚車搶刦事件已發生了十多起。然而一到了柬埔寨京城，便進入了另一世界，土人與安南人絕異，言語文字風俗習慣均不相同，文化水準甚低，人種較近於暹羅人與印度人，膚色黝黑，頭髮捲曲，女人穿裙不穿褲，情性懶惰。當地四境平靖，沒有戒嚴，歌舞通宵達且。南國的天氣，現在是旱季，顯得特別熟。湄公河畔有許多臨河開設的舞堪，當晚全體通宵，河裏遊艇，往來如織。記者於參加「彌撒」後坐在一家舞塲裏納凉，數着椰林上空的星星，耳畔傳來敎堂裏“Peace　on　Earth…Good　will　to　Men”的歌聲，深感和平的幸福！　　盜劫·擲彈　形成恐怖地獄　　舊歷新年前，記者回到西貢，又進入恐怖之域。越南全境除東京和安南兩部法越公開衝突之外，交趾支那表面上很太平，然而法軍所能控制的不過是點和綫，四鄉都在越盟勢力之下。西貢郊外時常有武裝軍人（法軍或越盟軍）入屋搶刦，中國領事館每天都有華僑家裘被刦的報吿。舊曆新年前後，西貢鬧市區域通衢廣衆之中，每天都有擲彈案發生，宛如一九四三年日軍佔領上海的恐怖時代一樣。每晚十時戒嚴，到午夜一二時必定聽見槍聲。　　華僑經商　本錢也收不加　　華僑守舊的多，廢曆新年本來是最歡娛的季節，然而今年的廢曆新年絲毫沒有新年氣象。最大的原因，是華僑營商的大多數虧本，運貨到海防河內順化各地的，因為時局關係，連本錢都收不回；運貨到外洋（如香港中國等地）的，又因為進出口統制，一切進出口均須經洋行之手，洋行交由買辦轉賣出來，從中抽取巨額佣金，零售商便無錢可賺。假定華僑零售商向洋行定購法國脾酒一箱，其官定配給價格係笠百元，加百分之三十零售利潤，可以每箱六百五十元之價格出售，但因買辦每箱要抽佣金二百元，故成本已是七百元，如照官價六百五十元出售，必然虧本。處此情景，只能高抬價格，由黑市出賣一途。　　黑市買賣　三個管制機構　　此地有三個管制黑市的機關：一是查禁黑市處（Section　de　laSuppression　du　Marche　Noir，一是評價委員會（Comite　desPrix），一是海關，專事檢查各業經營情况，一售黑市，即有被捕可能，一經被捕，貨物充公，外加罰鍰，有時還要監禁幾天。如果不經過洋行，自己直接辦理進口吧，首先，須得入口許可證，貨到了非等兩三個月不能完成報關手續。貨出來了，又須由請評價委員會評定價格，始可出售。而所評之價格每按官價匯率計算，華僑極難獲得官價外匯，只能從黑市中尋求，官價與黑市外匯相差極遠，例如港匯港幣一元官價匯率，合越幣一元七角，黑市則港幣一元値越幣七百元至九百元，如以黑市匯價購入香港貨物，按官價匯率定價出售，安有不虧本的道理？去年一年，華僑中除了買辦階級和少數有特殊勢力的人外，全部虧本。加以時局不靖，生命身體財產都受威脅。回想柬埔寨京城歌舞昇平的景象，眞是恍同隔世！只有和平才能給世人帶來幸福，只有和平才能使華僑經濟不致崩潰，才能使華僑，以至越人法人，安居樂業！浙江特產品展望  杭州二月廿七日訊　本報特派員儲裕生　　春天到了，不禁使人想起「一年之計在於春」的詞句來。　　我們生活在戰火沒曾波及到的浙江，而且是比較著名的富庶之鄉，應該可以苟安一時的，然而在全國經濟不景氣的浪潮下，浙江省也被捲入了兇惡的狀態之中。　　去年這一年，浙江省的特產蠶絲綢茶等，都因為外銷無望，所以養蠶的農胞呌苦迎天，綢莊也不克維持，茶行接連的倒閉。今年這一年，在歲首之時，已經看出了經濟的險象，將如何去克復以往存在着的困難，和解除新　襲來的窘狀，這在一年之計的春天，實在應該預為計劃的。　　農貸　　我們看見浙江省合作管理處與建設廳農民銀行及其他有關機關的農貸審議會的審議果，全部貸款應需八百五十餘億元，其由關於農業生產貸款育　，茶葉生產，桐油生產，棉花生產，漁業生產，種子，肥料，農具，耕畜等貸款共為一百五十九億二千六百五十八萬元。關於農業運銷貸款烘繭，收繭，繅絲，茶葉運銷，桐油運銷，桐油精製，漁業運銷，棉在運銷，竹木運銷，農產儲押等貸款共為六百三十六億六千萬元。關於農田水利貸款，小型水利工程，農村水力等貸款，共為十二億元。關於農業推廣貸款收購優良種子，繁殖等貸款共為八億二千五百萬元。關於農村副業貸款蔗糖，綠蔴加工，造紙，香末，製飽，家畜，養魚，養菱等貸款共計十六億一千萬元。關於土地金融貸款扶植自耕農，土地改良，土地重劃等貸款共為二十億元。貸款期限視各項事業需要而分長短，最長者為十年至十五年，如土地改良貸款及扶植自耕農貸款，期限最短者為三個月，如茶葉生產貸款桐油貸款。　　對象　　貸款對象為各種農業生產合作社與經營是項農業之鄉保合作社及各種生產工廠運銷機構等。對於大型農田水利工程費，另案呈請中央列入全國善後救濟基金項下撥支。我對於這個審議的結果，確覺得關於農業生產方面的貸款，無所不包。但全省農業生產的合作社為五千五百四十三個，社員為九十九萬五千一百九十三人。不加入合作社的自不能享此貸款的權利，那就是說在全省二千一百七十六萬二千二百四十八人中的大多數的農民，只有九十多萬人能得到貸款，這個比例未免太小。果然，中國的農村組織是散漫的，如果沒有組織是無法貸款的。但我們的農村中也保存着一種淳厚的古風，即是父親欠了的債還須兒子去償還。只要看高利貸一筆筆的向農村中借，他們並不是呆子，因為了解農胞的可靠。如果眞的沒有方法把農貨送上農胞的門的話，那麼可以在每一個大鄉鎭上設立農貸發放的機構，一面要到鄉間去大事宣傳，要他們來獲取農貸，貸後還須到鄉間去訪問，問他們到底得到實惠沒有？雖然這樣做去事情比較麻煩而又吃力，但是今天的中國農村已不容做農村事業工作的人輕鬆而又簡單。我們主張貸款的數字不妨再加大，但貸款的對象應該不限於合作社，貸款的時間要加快，不能讓坐在辦公室裏的人這樣辦手續和拖擱時問，更不可把這偌大的貸款來滾利息，我們要想到這一千多萬人民的迫切期待啊！春天到了，春耕是時候了，不要再讓他們借了高利貸，而結果把農貸去還高利貸啊！　　蠶絲　　這幾天來，據事實看來，農貸的數字雖巳提出，而比較緊張一點的到是在蠶絲方面，因為中蠶公司的總經理葛敬中來了，他計劃着如何開展浙江方面的蠶絲業，葛先生先慨嘆中國蠶絲業的落後。日本因為缺乏糧食，掘去桑樹種稻，所以蠶絲生產僅估戰前百分之三十，現在意大利的蠶絲業佔領了國際的市塲，而我們中國呢，雖然亦鬧糧荒，但沒有把桑樹有計劃的掘去，而　　生產也只有戰前百分之三十。這個事實的原因當然很多，但其主要的原因在收繭作絲時沒有相當的利潤，因此蠶農們心灰意懶，無心於此了。像去年那樣，政府規定收繭價格十萬元一担，而繭行硬只給六萬元一担，而把政府貸給十萬元一担的款扣下了四萬元。這種現象眞是令人痛心。今年聽說要改善辦法，由公家來收繭作絲，並且聽說每担要提高到三十萬元，務必做到一担繭子三担米。我們當然很問意這種改善的處置，但在現階段一般人不大相信公家辦事效率的時候，我們希望能够在這次收繭的工作上收回一些信用來。同時，照目前的物價看來，恐怕人工還要貴下去，那麼三十萬元一担。繭是不是使蠶農有利潤可收當然還是問題，不過好在現在還設有十分決定。目前比較重要的工作，照蠶絲當局的表示，似乎在推廣桑苗一萬五千枝。當然養蠶需要桑，所以桑急於蠶，殊不知去年農胞們的養蠶猶未足額，桑葉枯老在樹上的還是很多，這個原因就是繭賣不起錢，蠶農們知道了，在蟻蠶時就把牠們一匾一匾的倒到河裏去了。所以今天蠶絲最重要的課題就是要保證蠶晨們在賣繭時獲得合法的利潤。這個我認為在養蠶季節即將到來的時候，應該迅速決定的。　　茶葉　　蠶絲以外，茶業與綢業的貸款至今　猶未確定，我曾走問多方，都沒有具體的數字，但據說今年的茶業有些起色了。我曾走訪茶業界中人，他們分為兩說：一說是茶農無意種茶，茶行倒閉衆多，所以茶業比較好做些，一說是茶行無資經營，把茶葉向上海方面做押款，所以好像茶貨脫手的多了。這樣說來，今天浙江的茶業稍有起色也只是空洞的表面而已。綢業當然比較艱難的，但在艱難中如何使他們復甦過來，是不是貸款就可了事，這都是値得研究的問題。　　桐油　　桐油也是浙江一大特購，由中國植物油廠收惟，然後再運銷國外，　在今年舊歷年前，每担尙不到二十萬元，植物油廠因為外匯低，這廿萬元一担的桐油尙有躊躇不肯收的情形，桐農植一桐樹，須三四年始能長成，他們遭到油廠的拒絕，於是憤而砍去油桐，不再種植桐樹。我國植物油廠為官商合營的油廠，官股甚至多於商股，在外匯低的時候，事實上應該收購桐油，才是維護農業特產的辦法，不應該因為外匯低要賠本，而忍心讓桐晟毀滅他們自己的生計。由此，我們要鄭重提出，凡是一切特產，在外銷無路的時候，我們政府極應該忍痛收購一切特產，同時忍痛賠貼，與外國的同類特產在世界市塲上抗衡。而况今天收購特產的機構大半為國營的機構，更應如何來維護農村的特產生產者。過去的跡象看來，多多少少似乎致力在賺錢方面，而沒有注意到國家的根本問題——農村。這種雖然表面上沒有與民爭利，但實際上却是在做買賣了。　　春天到了，她帶來了暖和的陽光，但也帶來了一付重担，就是要我們從這個時候肩挑起，挑着跑完那一年的路程。我們要在此時重新計劃，詳加研究，珍情這寳貴的時光，來如何復興我們的事業。河內大鐵橋　（中央社攝）中國之鶯　女高音歌人在巴黎  巴黎二月十八日航訊　郭有守　　巴黎和北平，是大衆公認為世界上兩大最美麗的都市。巴黎尤有世界美術中心之稱。雖然受兩次大戰的影嚮甚大，許多有名發術家或遠渡大西洋到美國，近一點的也跨過海峽到了英國，但是戰爭一停，巴黎也逐漸恢復它舊日的地位。尤其聯合國教育科學文化組織，設在巴黎，無疑的巴黎不僅是藝術家的龍門，而且在敎育科學和文化三方面都居於領導地位。在這樣富有吸引力的都市裏，中國人在藝術方面有些什麽活動，想為國內讀者所欲深知的吧。　　三十五年夏，錢泰大使曾將筆者從國內帶出的四十餘幅書畫，連同此間學美術同學們的作品，在齊魯斯　博物館展覽二月。十月問留法中國藝術學會會負十餘人出所作雕刻繪畫二百餘件，假國立美術學院大廳展覽一月，此為同學們在該院聯合展覽之第一次。其次為十一月聯合國敎育科學文化組織主辦之「優乃斯可月」，國際美術展覽會，敎育部由國內寄來書畫廿餘幅，加入本人收藏之一部，成為中國部分。在各國出品中，最為出色。又留居巴黎逾二十年之中國畫家四川人常玉，出其作品三十餘幅，由謝公使壽康主持，在巴黎婦女俱樂部展覽。譽為「精華派」繪畫之創始人，極為美術界注意。　　音樂方面，在聯合國文敎會所辦戲劇音樂表演，初擬請政府派梅蘭芳等來演國劇，嗣以費用太大作能，中國遂未參加節目。到會代表，認為遺憾。市國出席文敎會代表團乃特為組織一晚會，邀請留法歌唱家周小無女士唱中國歌曲，鋼琴家李獻敏女士演奏中國曲調。到會各國代表，皆為驚佩，贊為聞所未聞。尤其周女士天賦歌喉，八年苦讀，學成問世，一嗚驚人，値得作一較詳的報道。　　銀行界的名流促進音樂敎育　　經手銀錢的人，一向為人所借重，但不常為人所尊重。銀錢為人生活上所必需之俗物，日與往還，難免於俗。此銀行家之所以常為社會君成一特殊階層，十九與文藝隔閡。但有很特殊的例外。周女士的父親，是銀行界有名的人，現任湖北省善後救濟分署署長周蒼柏先生。他喜歡音樂，不僅培養子女學習音樂，而且極力扶持音樂團體，促進音樂敎育，道位銀行家，是為藝術界所十二萬分擁戴的。　　凡是在民國二十六年從京滬撤退到漢口的人，總會記得當時的武漢合唱團。團員二十餘人，皆是愛好音樂的靑年男女，大部分是上海音專同學。周小燕是從廿四至廿六年在音專唸書，同俄國許息林敎授學唱。當時同學有郞毓秀吳樂怡女士等。周女士參加合唱團，常常獨唱各種救亡歌曲，合唱團由夏之秋指揮，提倡者為周蒼柏先生。合唱團練習，皆在周府舉行。　　周小燕姊妹四人，學唱，學鋼琴及學小提琴。兩個兄弟。一個在國內參加救亡工作病故。一個到法國後死去，留下一些作曲及未完曲。音樂天賦甚高，惜不永年。　　在巴黎音樂院見賞於蒲朗葉　　民國二十七年秋周小燕同她兄弟天佑，到了巴黎。不久進了國立音樂院，學唱三月，以嗓子發抖暫輟學。改從曾在俄國任敎授多年之意大利人貝爾拿丁先生學唱。貝氏為有名之男中瞥，年近七十，經騐宏富。二十九年從巴黎逃難至法國南部比亞銳特，至靠西班牙境格塔利地方。兩個月後重回巴黎，縱續與貝氏學習。在逃難前，僅能唱一個多音節。又只限於練習歌詞。頗為懊喪。逃難時貝氏吿以輟唱並忘記一切迨逃難後回巴黎，已能唱歌劇「雷格列托」中之女高音，此為第一進步。　　在音樂院時，女指揮蒲朗葉女士頗賞識小燕歌聲美麗，且銳於感覺。曾約同赴美國避難，當時以不得艙位，遂未問去。三十年起更從柏汝賈夫人學音樂會歌。選從馬誼夫人學歌劇分段，從事升堂入室的造詣。　　兩次重要節目小燕參加播唱　　三十五年三月廿八日，倫敦援華會于白廳戲院組織中國音樂會募款。邀請周小燕女士，李獻敏女士及其夫齊爾品先生表演。事前中宣部倫敎辦事處長葉公趙曾為兩女士印相片節目單以廣宣傳。這次音樂會聽衆，不僅欣賞周女士的歌聲，且覺其英法語解釋的流暢，態度文雅，裝容美麗，皆留下良好和深刻的印象。八月間聯合國同志會在盧森堡舉行大會，周女士應邀樂行獨唱會，並在電台廣播。雙十節中國軍事代表團特請赴柏林在復興劇院舉行兩次獨唱會。德國電台並請廣播。此外便是剛纔提到的十二月九日中國出席文敎會代表團組織的晚會，和一月十三日晚文敎會理事會中國理事與秘書處三位中國職員，聯名邀請秘書處三百餘位同事的昔樂會。都是靠周小燕李獻敏兩女士和中國女婿齊爾品先生的熱心贊助，使得中國在國際組織中，有積極的活動，居於領導地位，而不是追隨大强之後，湮沒無聞的。　　一月十八日晚，法國廣播電台對英國播音，特請周女士作十五分鐘播唱。（致二千法郞報酬，合十六美金。）這不過是周女士以所學問世的開始。完全以自己的藝術作職業，不依賴政府的提倡或扶特以成名。二月間已定程序。除參加蒲郞葉女士指揮的合唱團，廣播巴赫的「熱情」中獨唱外。並預定於二月廿五日在巴黎著名的卡沃大廳舉行獨唱會。卡沃應是第一流音樂家舉行音樂會的地方。預備兩點鐘節目；法，意，英，德，俄，和中國的作品十九種。中國方面居其四。有雲南民歌，劉雷厂作紅豆及採蓮。這次獨唱會在周女士前途為一畫時代重要性。以前參加或為募捐，或為接待高賓，多為義務性質，所謂玩票。從今以後以歌唱為職業，獨唱會之威就，便可以為社會欣賞的測騐。所謂「一唱定夭下」也。巴黎內行甚多，非有相當水準，不能妄登擂台。　　三月問程序，已預定廿六日在鄉賽里塞戲院唱蚌壳。（蕭瑜先生就中國故事作歌，齊爾品作譜。）此外瑞士日內瓦中國國際圖書館館長胡天石正與當地音樂界接洽，邀周女士赴日內瓦舉行獨唱會。　　歸納專家批評具有三大特點　　周女士是專習唱女高音的。當然一個人的嗓子，論理是天生就的，但若地合宜的訓練，不是受損壞，便是無方法。據她自己感覺，以前在國內唱歌，發音由口中直出，頗嫌平泛。經過訓鄉後，音經過上口腔，由拋弧綫發出。筆者外行，頗覺有些像彈道。她這幾年經過名師指導，從去年三月在倫敦表演以後，已有驚人的進步。歸納專家批評，她聲音的特點：第一是純粹而無瑕疵。第二是似結晶透明而堅實，難得之資質。第三是有個性，雖然她能唱中，法，英，意，德，俄各國文字的歌，與各該本國歌唱者一樣好，這不算十分可貴。貴在尙有點外來情調。這或許是中國天才，保持了自己的文化背景。所以報上常稱她為「中國黃鶯」。並譽其歌喉，為巴黎目前唯一無二者。　　中國幾位女歌唱家，喩宜萱·冷竹琴·郞毓秀諸女士均在國內主持音樂敎育。當必樂聞這一位後來居上的同志。十餘年在法比學音樂的女士，作曲家蕭淑嫻和瑞士音樂指揮結婚，鋼琴家李獻敏和作曲家俄國齊爾品結婚。年餘以前周女士也幾乎作了波斯外交官的夫人，因家庭不贊成，她對父親和母親　燕　夫人都有特深情感。否則又是本國天才外溢的損失。　　中歐藝術聯繫應予積極推進　　中國與歐洲的廣播聯繫不其得方。中央電台不够强，歐洲難於聽到。從歐洲播回，也很不容易。周女士二月廿五日音樂會正與偷敦英國廣播公司接洽　片轉播。中國音樂對外宣傳太差。馬思聰·劉雪厂都應該由政府派送出國相常時期。聽說由吳國　提倡的音樂訪問團，參加的人有黃　尹·吳樂怡·馬思弘及其姊等，有赴美表演計畫。聞這次在武漢大學開音樂會。周蒼柏先生除招待外，並親到街上為他們廣吿。居然在老的一輩中，找到一位「音樂奴隸」。　　以地大物博人衆著稱的中國，出類拔萃的人才，在國外可以很有地位。巴黎同學中在科學界稱三傑的錢三强（錢夫人亦有發現）汪德昭和蔡柏林，很受贊揚。中國藝術在國外有很高地位。若干畫家在國內苦悶，都應該把作品帶到國外展覽。這一點便希望政府多多扶持。英國有一個文化委員會，每年預算有五百多萬英鎊，來作文化工作，英國藝術到國外展覽，或英國音樂到國外演奏，都是該會生持。　　筆者此時，濫竽文敎會。倘一旦失業，甚願以藝術經理為職業，為畫家籌辦畫展，為雕刻家招領工作，為音樂家主辦音樂。只求能把中華民族的優點，傳播出去，使世人更為了解，進而愈加尊崇。以中國藝術同化世界，似亦並非不可能。　　暹羅大理石王宮遠眺荷蘭老華僑  萊汀二月廿二航訊　本報特約記者往仁　　涵塘為荷蘭海上王國之首都，正猶北美合衆國一切重大事業之集中於紐約，我中華為東亞文明古國，人民篤好和平，故在國内多務農，尙信義而富冒險精神。至國外喜經商而勇於航海。中華旅荷僑衆，今以廣東浙江山東三省為多。山東人智識最豐，廣東人資格最老，而浙江之靑田溫州兩宗遠客，則心性機靈，行動勤敏。涵塘市萬商雲築，白手起家，好經商之靑田浙僑，往往徒步旅行橫絕數萬里征程之亞歐大陸，起自東海之濱，經年累月而遠臨西海，苦費經營，大肆活躍，靑田人之中，姓王者頗非少數　中華民國十一年於洛塘市創設旅荷華僑會館之已故靑田僑商王梓楠就涵塘經理船務又在海牙開設餐館，在一九三九年第二屆歐戰發動以前號稱首當，即其一例。最近如本年之三月十一日，復有遍歷法比德諸國旅荷十餘年之靑田大嶺阜鄉民王君鳳賢，喜逢七十生辰，大宴同鄉親友，為荷全境中國僑友中年齒最長之人，預宴者第一日之客，盡來自外省各埠，第二日之客，則限於本京，兩日各到百餘人，共收壽禮三千六百七十餘荷金，其第一日往涵塘之晚班二等車，滿載華人荷客，見之　疑為定期集會，而斷不料其為赴壽筵，惜乎八簋之珍，有酒有肉，而不能如安居國內者之飽啖白米飯，面聯歡好客，盛極一時，自是靑田浙僑特具之風尙，與廣東山東諸僑不同，廣東人足跡所到之地，如得十人以上相聚於一堂，即起而組織會所，如致公堂崇正會梧峯公所汝南別墅之類，大抵為謀　體瓦助而發生，然其弊在待助於人，而失却自身之活動力，此乃海員生活不易倖逃之公例，而靑田浙僑皆業商，純任自由，其中每一人，極易發展自闢新大陸之個性與活動力，茍其人貧至賣糖為生，亦仍大有差別，粤僑只知滯留城中心，而待同情者之解囊光顧，浙僑恒先尋到離城中心特遠之郊野鄉村，至彼大廣銷路，或候於大工廠門外，趁男女工散値外出之時，一舉而投其所好，直可穩操勝算，然而冒風霜忍飢餓，倍增勞苦，如比不知書又不通國語之大嶺阜老人王鳳賢，竟以飢寒損健衛，釀成腹由鼓氣作痛之病，巧於設筵祝壽之前後兩天，暫進醫院，厥狀乃類國內避壽之闊人，國人在海外生存，奮鬥艱難一以例千，略可想見。讀者意見規約　　（一）本欄絕對公開，文賣自負。但切忌冗長。（二）切勿攻許私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆明。（四）本欄稿件概不致酬。（五）對來稿本報有删節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，槪不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考，　　匪共屠殺慘痛兩證　　編輯先生：　　敬借　貴報一角，披露啓海一帶匪軍的舉行，並仰持正義，激發國人之同情請政府速增派國軍，肅淸鄉問之匪軍，以安民生。　　去年廢曆年底，潛伏於海啓東部之匪軍，得悉國軍推進，即在其勢力所及地區，先將「三資〕階級大加屠殺。國軍推進駐守各鎭後，又嚴令鄉民；「不准與市鎭溝通，如有以一粒榖一枝菜，售予鎭上市民或國軍者，當夜即處以死刑」，如此而死於非命者屢有所聞。　　但悲慘的命運，何至於此，最近大問鎭與三餘鎭一帶，國軍奉令他調，匪軍乘機更形活動，晝夜燒殺良民，自八歲孩童，至四五十歲老年人幾無一倖免者，大好田園，全化為灰燼。故同聲續請國軍，勿多調離，以免遭匪屠殺，尤請旅滬通海啓同鄉，共發聯合請願，希望國軍加强保護故鄉，並期早日肅淸殘匪，則地方幸甚。（一個逃亡來申之難民）敬啓　　二月廿七日　　又一件　　前日據如皋縣屬，掘港區最近來人謂：本年廢曆正月十九日夜，駐軍（國軍）奉令他調，因地方自衛隊人數太少，市區地盤長達五華里，不敷文配防守。於是與區公所辦公人員尾隨國軍西撤，而人民隨行者數達六七萬，是日天降大雪，泥濘難行，老幼哭聲載道，登舟者竟以搶先容載不下之故，有溺斃者，行至岔河鎭住宿三日，由縣府將接濟窮民之麵粉米榖等撥給該六七萬難民充食，縣長見此狼狽情形，不禁淚下，隨即調派保安隊一個中隊，護難民返掘駐守，岔河駐軍（國軍）某旅長，亦曾急電調派部隊趕往掘港。孰知共軍幹部早已聞風，由鎭長石長年。（掘港人）領同民兵至區公所搜索公物一過，即行遁出市萬，潛伏四郊，屠殺人民，自去年臘月初九起，至目前，掘港之東，（共軍稱掘東區）被其戕殺六百餘人之多。單頭戰埠，一夜工夫，即被殺死六十餘人，盡皆智識份子及稍具資產之士。故人民迄今皆談虎色變。（鍾亮）　　張埝的衛生呼聲　　編者先生：張埝是金山縣很著名的一個市鎭，人口衆多，市面繁榮，因係產米地區，是以米業最盛。張埝人生活相當舒適，唯衛生方面頗不注意，公共衛生更談不到。聽任街道上草　垃圾汚水滿佈，幾無插足之處，街頭巷尾隨地小便，厠所內外溺尿滿地，汚臭難近，雖設有淸道伕終日打掃，無奈一般市民不顧自愛，仍將汚穢物件向街道上隨便亂拋，歷年將鎭上空地上，堆成三四個數丈高的垃圾土山，冷街僻巷，亦復如是。山入本鎭的人們，必須由垃圾上經過，繁榮的張埝，竟變成　　藏垢納汚的地帶，現當春令，疫　將盛，尤為可慮。　望縣鎭衛生當局，趕速設法改善。（尹風）二·廿七。　　善連鎭小不不健全　　編者先生；　　余於民國卅年遷居吳興善連，小兒二人求學於本鎭中心國民學校內，今年該校章校畏接縣政府命令，以任期已滿應予免戰，該校即停辦，迄今仍無人籌備開學。據云該校去年經費無着，因之章校畏與各敎職員等均吃自己飯完全義務做事，學雜費學米又一槪不收，熱心服務精神深得地方人士贊許，今該校停辦，數百學生勢將失學。查本鎭目前居民約六千餘人，而國民學校僅第一保一所，且用三宇經百家姓神童詩一類課本，第三保有私立小學一所，敎法陳舊，不求改進，至其他各保私墊盛行，設備簡陋，吳興素被譽為文物之邦，而鄉鎭敎育竟如此落後，望地方士紳，敎衣當局，急起補救。（失學者上）</p>

<p>春秋談生活  趙淸閣　　生活，像海！支持生活的事業，經濟，學問，道德，戀愛，友誼等等，像一羣泛濫的波浪，人，像這海中的一葉小舟之掌柁者，時刻都在和這許多波浪戰鬥，稍不當心，就有被顚覆的危險！所以一個人的入世，便是一個沒休止的戰鬥，無論你是帝王，或乞丐，都一樣經歷了勝利也經歷了失敗，經歷了歡樂，也經歷了辛酸！　　一個人在生活的海裏，不可能幸運得連一點漣漪都遭遇不到。否則，你那一葉小舟便只有停滯着，甚而逐漸潰爛，沉于汙泥中！　　沒有戰鬥，就沒有進步，戰鬥是要流血流汗的，於是人會病，會老，會死！可誰也不曾先為了畏懼病，老，死，而去逃避了戰鬥！固然，戰鬥屬於人性本能的自然趨勢，但同時屬於後天敎育的養成！　　戰鬥容易，能操守着一個重心的戰　，難！比如事業的浪把你打到西；經濟的浪把你打到東；學問的浪把你衝向南；道德的浪把你衝向北；戀愛的浪把你捲進前；友誼的浪把你捲退後；而每條浪有時又會分出無數波紋；你究竟在這亂蔴中到東抑到西；向南抑向北；進前抑退後；這便要憑着你的智慧去辨識眞理，　穩了柁，然後從羣浪滔滔裏划出一綫光明的路，找得你能安身立命的碼頭泊下來！　　在戰鬥中你又必須有百折不迴的精神，把許多那些包圍你的敵人同時當作你追求的對象。這是說你不應恨它們而要愛它們，當你一旦征服它們，然後風平浪靜了，你　一個勝利者的身份誇耀於生活的海，你便可以安恬地享受在無涯的幸福裏！　　反之，假如你怯懦，或則甘於被任何一種波浪捲蝕，那你將只有陷落在痛苦的深淵；你將只有與魚蝦為伍；你將永遠埋葬在砂土裏；你將永遠看不見太陽！　　世界上，有多少成功的人是在生活的海裏戰鬥的勝利者，也有多少與魚蝦為伍的人變成陷落在砂土中的腐屍！　　懂得生活的人，你可以自由地架着你的一葉小舟——（小舟就是你的思想，你的心靈。）盪漾在碧藍的海裏，擁抱那些襲擊你的波浪，美化戰鬥，懷着藝術家的情緒，把海視作一首詩，把波浪視作一幅畫！　　生活的海是詩；波浪是畫；人是一葉小舟的掌柁者；掌柁者就是上帝，能給予自己以無涯的幸福，也能陷自己以於痛苦的深淵！（三六·二·二八·夜於滬濱。）眞理上帝知道，但要等待  托爾斯泰著·田仲濟譯　　（續昨）「你是從什麼地方來的？」一個人問。　　「從維拉蒂米鎭，我家作在那個鎭上。我的名子叫馬克亞，他們都叫我塞曼奇。」　　愛克司諾夫抬起頭來說：「吿訴我，塞曼奇。你知維拉蒂米鎭上姓愛克司諾夫的商人的情形麽？他們還活着麼？」　　「知道他們？常然我知道。小愛克司諾夫兄弟很當有，雖然他們父親是在西伯利亞，像我們這樣的一個罪人。像你，老爹，你是怎麽來的呢？」　　愛克司諾夫不願再說到他的不幸，他僅長嘆了一聲說「因為我的罪，我已經在獄裏過了二十六年了。」　　「什麼罪？」馬克亞塞曼奇問。　　愛克司諾夫僅回答道：「好了，好了——就是我最應常得的！」他一點也不多說了，還是他的伙伴吿訴了這個新來的，愛克司諾夫怎樣來的西伯利亞；怎樣有人將一個商人殺了而將刀子放在了愛克司諾夫的東西裏邊，因此他坐了這樣的寃獄。　　馬克亞塞曼奇聽了這話，向愛克司諾夫望着，拍着息己的膝頭，驚嘆的說：「好！這事奇怪，眞奇怪！但是，老爹、你已經老了多少啊！」　　別人問他為什麽他這末驚異，從前在什麽地方他曾見過愛克司諾夫；但馬克亞塞曼奇不回答，他僅祗是說「那眞奇怪，我們在這裏遇上，孩子們！」　　這些話使愛克司諾夫疑惑這個人或者知道是誰殺死的那商人，因此他說：「塞曼奇，是你聽到那件事情過呢，或是從前曾見過我呢？」　　「我怎麽能聽到呢？這世界上是充滿了謠言，但那是很久以前了，我也忘了我聽到的是甚麼了！　　「你聽到誰殺死了那個商人？」愛克司諾夫問。　　馬克亞塞曼奇大笑着回答；「那必定是在他口袋裏翻出刀子的人。若是旁人將刀子藏在那裏像俗語說的好，『除非他被捕，他便不是賊。』他人怎樣會放一把刀子在你頭下的口袋裏呢？那還不驚醒你麼？」　　愛克司諾夫聽了這些話後他感覺到這一定是殺商人的那個人，他站起來到別處去了，整夜的時間淸醒的躺在那裏，他內心非常的煩惱，過去的許多的印像又在他腦中復現：他看見了他的妻，她的臉她的眼部很淸楚的現在他的面前，那好像他離別她要到市鎭的一次，她的言語和笑聲他都聽見了。他又看見了他的小孩，像那個時候是的，都很小，一個穿着一件小外套，一個還在他母親懷裏吃乳。於是他又想到了他自己以前——年靑和愉快。他還記得他怎樣坐在旅店的走廊裏彈六弦琴，而在那裏被捕。他又怎樣從憂慮中擺脫出來。在他幻想中看到了他被鞭打的地方，執刑的，和許多人圍繞着他；鐵鍊子，囚犯，這二十六年的他的牢獄生活，和他早　的年齡。這一些造成他了這樣的不幸，以至使他想自殺。　　「那都是那個惡棍的行為造成的！」愛克司諾夫這樣想着。他對於馬克亞塞曼奇憤恨起來，他切望去復仇，就是他自己的身子死去也不管，他禱吿了一夜，但怎樣也得不到安慰，到了白天，他躱着馬克亞塞曼奇。不看他。　　這樣的兩星期過去，愛克司諾夫夜間總不能睡眠，他是那樣的可憐，說不出自己是怎末樣好。　　一個夜問他在監獄中散步，忽看到了一些土從一個囚犯的架牀底下向外流。他站住察看。忽然馬克亞塞曼奇匍匐的從架十底下爬出，抬頭看到了愛克司諾夫臉色顯得非常的驚慌，愛克司諾夫想不看他就走過去，但馬克亞塞捉住了他的手對他說，他在牆下邊挖了一個窟窿，他將掘出的土打掃乾凈了放在他的高統靴子裏，當每天囚犯被帶出去作工時便掮着撒在路上。　　「你要保守秘密，老人，並且你也可以一塊逃出去，若是洩漏了消息，他們必然要鞭打死我，但我一定先殺死你。」　　愛克司諾夫看到他的仇敵氣憤的戰抖着，他洒脫了他的手說，「我不希望逃，你也不需要殺我；很久以前你已經殺了我了！關於你的事—說不說由我，上帝他總明白！」　　第二天當囚犯們被領出去作工的時候，獄卒發覺了有犯人從靴子裏向外倒土。於是察看監獄，發見了那個洞口。獄官來了，他問所有的囚犯，是誰挖的那個窟窿，他們都說不知道，有知道的也不說出是馬克亞塞雙奇來，因為那樣他必然被鞭打到將死，最後獄官轉向愛克司諾夫說，因為他知道他是一個正直的人：　　「你是一個忠誠的老者；在上帝的面前吿訴我，是誰挖的這個洞？」　　馬克亞塞曼奇站在那裏，好像漠不關心似的，他直看着愛克司諾夫，倒不很注意獄官，愛克司諾夫的嘴唇和兩手都戰抖了，待了很久的時候，他一　　也說不出來，他想，「他害了我的一生，我為什麼要替他隱瞞呢？讓他來賠償我所受的痛苦罷。但是若我說了出來，或他們要將他鞭打至死，並且我疑心朱必不是錯疑了，而且，總而言之，於我又有甚麽好處呢？」　　「好，老頭，」獄官重複的說，「吿訴我們實話，誰在牆下邊挖的呢？」　　愛克司諾夫向馬克亞塞曼奇一瞥說道，「大人，我不能說，呌我說並不是上帝的意思！對我你愛怎樣辦怎樣辦罷；我是在你的掌握中。」　　無論獄官怎樣問，愛克司諾夫不再多說一句話了，這事也就這樣沉寂下了。　　那夜愛克司諾夫正躺在牀上將睡着的時候，一個人輕輕的進來坐在了他的牀上，他在黑暗中認出了是馬克亞。　　「你還要求我甚麼呢？」愛克司諾夫問，「為什麼你到這裏來？」　　馬克亞塞曼奇一聲也不響。於是愛克司諾夫坐起來說，「你來想作甚麽？快去，不然我就喊獄卒來！」　　為克亞塞曼奇跪着伏在愛克司諾夫身上低聲的說，「伊凡·搭米垂，宥恕我！」　　「為甚麽呢？」愛克司諾夫問。　　「那是我啊，殺了那個商人將刀子藏在你的東西裏的，我本想連你也殺了，但因聽着外面有響聲，所以我就將刀子藏在了你的口袋裏而從窗子上跳出來逃走了。」　　愛克司諾夫一句話也不說，他不知道說甚麽好。馬克亞塞曼奇離開了牀跪在了地下，「伊凡。搭米垂，」他說，「宥恕我吧！為上帝的愛宥恕了我罷！我一定去自首殺那個商人的是我，你就可以被釋放而回到家中去了。」　　「你說話倒容易，」愛克司諾夫說，「我替你受了這二十六年的罪，現在我能够到其麼地方去呢？我的妻己經死了，我的兒子都不認得我了。我沒有地方去了……」　　馬克亞塞曼奇仍不站起來，他只用力向地上磕頭「伊凡·搭米垂，宥恕我吧！」他哭喊著。「他們鞭打我的時候還不及現在見了你這樣難以忍受呢！……而且你又可憐我，不將我的過錯吿訴他們。為上帝的綠故，宥恕了我罷，我是那樣的可憐！」他鳴咽了。　　愛克司諾夫聽到他鳴咽，也坐起來了。　　「上帝將宥恕你！」他說。「或者我還比你壞百倍呢。」說了這句話，他心中立刻感到光明，想家的念頭也沒有了，他已不再希望離開這牢獄，只希望他最後的時間快快的到來。　　愛克司諾夫無論　　　馬克亞塞曼奇也不顧，他去自首了他的罪狀，但釋放的命令到達時，愛克司諾夫也死了。（完）花鳥  張書旗孤雁　兩首  許如輝　　（一）　　徘徊！　徘徊！　　天上有孤雁，　　雲間徘徊！？　　飛也去，　　飛也回！　　何所依；　　何所歸。　　幻變的雲霧，　　　環繞着天涯；人　！　　陣陣雨；　　離聲雷。　　宇宙——　　大地——　　一般地在辛酸；　　悲哀！　　（二）　　徘徊！　　徘徊！　　天上有孤雁，　　雲間徘徊？！　　入風雲，　　破霞彩，　　越瓊林；　　渡洋海。　　凌空的盤旋，　　找尋着「自由博愛」。　　深深慮，　　重重哀！　　天上——　　人間——　　一般地在惶恐！　　疑猜！宋元的女「說話人」  振之　　近世的彈詞，淵源於宋代的「淘眞」和元代的「詞話」；而女彈詞又源出盲女彈詞。詞話一類，本以彈唱為主，演習的人男女都有，從宋元到現在一直沒有改變。但以說為王的許話的一類，就稍有不同：後世習評話的大抵男子居多，女說書極少；然而宋元「說話人」却兼有男女，和後世彈詞相同。　　宋人記風土的書，如吳自牧「夢梁錄」，西湖老人「繁勝錄」，周密「武林舊事」等書所載，都有女「說話人」。綜合這幾部書所說，有下面的若干人：「演史」有張小娘子，宋小娘子，陳小娘子三人；「說經」有陸妙慧，陸妙靜二人，「小說」有史惠英，陳郞婦二人。這八個人雖不及「說話人」全體六分之一，但宋代有女「說話人」却無可置疑。　　元代的情形也是一樣。楊維楨「東維子文集」卷六有「送朱女士桂英演史序」，就是為當時女「說話人」而作。文云：　　「錢唐為宋行都，男女痡峭，尙嫵媚，號　袖驕民。當思陵上太皇號，孝宗奉太皇壽，一時御前應制多女流也。若碁待召為沈姑姑；演史為張氏，宋氏，陳氏；說經為陸妙慧，妙靜；小說為史憲英；隊戲為李瑞娘；影戲為王潤卿：皆申二〔按校記作「中一」〕時　點之選也。兩宮游幸聚景正津內園，各以藝呈，天顏　動，則賞賣無算。此太平朝野極盛之際。今當壯力嗚鏑，語時，故家遺老，或與退璫畸　談先朝故事，未嘗不興感隕淚也！　　「至正丙午春二月，予蕩舟娭春，過　渡，一姝淡粧素服，貌姗雅，呼長年　權，歙袵而前，稱：朱氏名桂英，家在錢唐，世為衣冠　族，善記稗官小說演史於三國五季。因延致舟中，為予說道君艮嶽及秦太師事，座客傾耳　；知其腹笱有文史，無烟花脂粉。予奇之曰：使英遇思陵太平之朝，如張，央〔校記作「宋」〕，陳，陸，史輩，談通典故，入登禁壺，豈久居瓦市間耶？曰忠曰孝，貫穿經史於稠人廣中，亦可以敦勵薄俗。財〔才如〕吾徙〔徒〕號儒丈夫者，為不如己！古稱盧文進女為女學士，予於桂英亦云。」　　按楊氏這篇文章，雖類似贈伎之作，但史料價値並不可忽視。所說宋代女「說話人」，大體不出「武林舊事」等書範圍以外。至於元代的實例，是未見於他書的。「說話」中的「講史」，「小說」兩家的伎藝，比彈唱較為吃力，又無新聲可以聳動聽衆，因之元代以後的女「說話人」都從演說轉到演唱方面　，所以元代以後這類人就絕跡了。一寸山河一寸血　189</p>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>經理說到這裏，頓了一頓，又瞧了W君一眼；</p>
<p>「他隱在我們這裏，已經有二年多了，雖然失明，仍舊幹着海外通訊工作，用英法兩種文字，在英美法幾個大報上發表文章。他這裏常有中韓兩國的人來往，多半是女子，供給他的情報。貼身以有一位小姐，帮着打字，讀報。父女倆工作極其勤苦。……</p>
<p>「今天來的這位李金子小姐，從昨天起，一共來過兩次…我們因為這位小姐既是這位柳平同志認識的，所以沒有作「第二度方式」調查。」</p>
<p>「我還得麻煩您一句，」鶴見似乎沒有十分　準這位經理的報吿，「在這十幾分鐘内，只有這一位高麗女子進來嗎？還是另有別的婦女？…我意思想請貴部下，就是那位供給這個報吿貴部下，到道兒來一下…」</p>
<p>「那可以。」經理答應着，一面站了起來，瞧着W君，看看是否還有別的意見</p>
<p>W君剛剛伸手預備去捺電鈕喚人的當口，忽然那門上裝着的電機信號嘶嘶地響了起來，報警的紅燈也連迎閃動着，同時兩個電話上的鈴聲，把屋子裏的空氣，震動得十分緊張起來。</p>
<p>兩座電話的鈴聲，電信機的嘶呌，報警燈光的閃爍，同時發作，當然吸收了全屋子的注意，也震蕩了各人的心弦。這一種塲面，換了第二三個人，勢必攪得手忙脚亂；可是W君，冷靜得很，就像例行辦公似的，光把一座電話聽筒拿起來，同時點首示意，命耀羣接那另外一座電話；又吩咐那位經理到樓下去照管，準備意外，耀　剛趨前抓起了聽筒的時候，只聽得屋門上有人輕輕敵了兩下，接着門一開，閃進了一位靑年的壯士，隨手把門闔上。這時警報嘶聲　燈光已經停止。</p>
<p>「不必撤退，留在崗位上，隨時報吿消息，命令！」W君答覆了外來的電話，同時向進來的那位靑年壯士點點頭，意思呌他進前報吿。</p>
<p>「不必撤退，留崗位上，隨時報吿消息，總部命令！」耀羣似乎收到了同樣性質的電話，五官並用，也學着W君一樣答覆，只在「命令」上加了「總部」二字，表示命令的立塲。覆畢，一面放下聽筒，一面對W君行了敬禮，「西區三十二站前進哨崗，發現敵人搜索大隊，向東，東南，進行，恐是向總部這裏襲來，所以請示辦法，並問是不是需要撤退。」報吿完了，又行了一個敬禮。</p>
<p>W君點了點頭，輕輕說了「謝謝！」兩個字。這似乎有些例外。耀羣本來已經和虎城正式加人W君這個組織，並且等級也並不怎樣高。照理，下為對上司說話，報吿，等項，從來沒有聽見過上司用過「謝謝」這兩個字。這是洋派，還是另有涵義？這是另有涵義的：可能的解釋，乃是由於耀羣的知識水準很高，常常參加行動計到研究；部要雖也有幾位女子，却不能像耀羣這樣出類拔萃，所以名義上耀羣雖算W君的下屬，其實W君總拿客卿或顧問的地位來優待耀羣。否則像前次同　城私上雙龍數的一回事，雖說幹了一件有利的工作，可是從機關條規和法令的立塲上講，沒有得到上司的命令，任意行動，應該</p>

<h3>東洋魚</h3>
<p>— 紫流</p>
<p>從前我在家鄉，常常吃到一種名為東洋魚的鹹魚，這種魚鱗皮上了鹽是灰黃色的，肉紅得好像火腿一樣，吃起來頗有滋味。因為那時候，國人對日本的印象壞到極點，常常有抵制日貨的事發生，攤子上的東洋魚也會被年靑的學生們倒掉的。當時我以為倒掉東洋魚的行動很對，這種不愛國的人應該給他處罰。因而我對吃東洋魚的興趣味也减低了。</p>
<p>可是後來有人吿訴我：所謂東洋魚不是眞正從日本運來的，而是日本人在中國東北沿海捕捉去的魚而加以鹽醃買給中國的。這樣，我就感到非常的不愉快：為什麽中國海內的魚要給日本人捉，而且名之為「東洋魚」？</p>
<p>抗戰發動後，這種魚，我一直沒有看到過。及至抗戰勝利，我想念起這種魚，深信此後日本人再沒有資格來捕捉這樣魚？而這種魚必然將改稱為我們中國自己的什麽名字了吧。可是迄今我還沒有看到這種魚，這眞使我感到非常的奇怪！</p>
<p>看今天的晚報，說中國已與駐日麥帥總部成立協立，准許日本船隻在中國海外，朝鮮及琉球領海內捕魚，日本人可在朝鮮琉球領海內捕魚，我們姑且不去說他，此後也許他們在中國海外捕魚，不是也和抗戰以前一樣的要把我們中國海內的魚，捉去稱為「東洋魚」買與「中國」人了吧？</p>
<p>我眞感到奇怪：難道我們中國海內的魚自己不會捕捉，一定要請日本人來捕捉再賣給我們吃麽？難道我們忘記了過去日本之所以能够武力侵略中國，是由經濟侵略而逐漸發展起來，而捕魚權之被侵害，正是經濟侵略的起點嗎？</p>
<h3>「老J．B」</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>密勒氏評論周報的前任總編輯，J．B鮑威爾，在華盛頓因心臟病猝發，不治逝世.也雖然一再表示過想回上海來看看他的老服友們，但終於無緣見勝利後的中國!</p>
<p>在上海新聞界中，你要是提起「鮑威爾先生」來，別人會問你是「那一個鮑威爾？」因為密勒氏評論周報現在的總編輯正是J．B的兒子，而父子對中國的論調，很有相當不同。但是你要是一提起「J．B」，大家就知道必係這位頗喜修飾的老鮑威爾無疑。</p>
<p>J．B最出風頭的時候，就是國軍西撤，上海租界上「七十六號」匪徒們橫行的一個時期。這時候，暗殺之風極盛，但密勒氏評論周報却每期必有一篇暴露偽組織內幕的文章——如周佛海與陳公博問之爭執，丁默邨與李士羣的暗鬥，都極痛快淋漓的公諸於世。密勒氏評論周報在當時簡直是洛陽紙貴，每星期出版的那天，總是一搶即空，甚至有再版三版的。</p>
<p>J．B當然很知道自己正處在極危險的境地，所以常常　伏夜出，還僱了隨身保鏢。他是住在花旗總會的，離密勒氏評論報的辦公處（愛多亞路一百六十號）很近，有一天，大概在下午四五點鐘的時候，他以為四馬路近江西路一帶那時正極熱鬧，竟冒險步行到報館去，剛走到愛多亞路口，忽然有一個人拿一個長圓形新聞紙包紮的包裹向他擲去。大槪J．B的西裝實在太「流綫型」了，這包裏竟在他肩頭滑過，掉在地下J．B用手杖把那個包裏撥了一下——面正是一顆炸彈！</p>
<p>從此之後，J．B更小心了，然而他還是常常通宵坐在打字機前面，向敵人毫無顧忌的挑戰。有時我去拜訪他，他會突然問我對於某一事件的意見，問得非常仔細，非常周到，彷彿是考試似的—有時，這些不成熟的意見居然也被採用，不過經他「消化」之後，已經變得非常周密了。</p>
<p>J．B喜歡打扮，用的裝飾品極為考究。也喜歡收蔽假古董，地毯，在他戰後寫的那本「出國二十年」中，還頻頻以這些假古董為念。他也常問我在大學裏每年用多少銀，接着就訴苦說他的兒子在印度讀書化錢實在太多。但是，誰知道小鮑威爾現在繼承父志，倒也頗有成就呢！</p>
<p>小鮑威爾呌「J．W」我們稱他畢爾（Bill」，思想上似乎和J．B不同，但他自己說：「我們曾在日本長談渦許多問題，我們發見在本質上我們並沒有什麼不同。」眞的，美國不是同時有范登堡和垂萊士嗎？</p>

<h3>筆名的故事</h3>
<p>— 蕭長道</p>
<p>當自己第一篇投稿的文章被刋出了之後，　無邊際的喜悅與興奮而來的，是一種迫切而且强烈的衝動——我得為自己題取一個筆名。</p>
<p>這樣的衝動在自己是認為非常嚴肅的，雖則連自己也說不出其所以然來。一種莫名其妙的，但是十分堅强的潛意識死釘住我，我竟至不自覺地無形中給自已定了一個約束，在沒有筆名之前，我將不發表文章了，一如儼然已是一個成名的作家，而成名的作家固類多非有筆名不可者也。</p>
<p>於是在動手寫第二篇稿子時之前，我便開始為自己最得意的筆名而搜索枯腸。</p>
<p>首先：我便想到，旣然立志做文人寫作家，我得於熟讀文藝創作之類的入門書而外，更須在筆名上寄寓奮勉的意義，庶幾藉以自勵而策來茲。於是便搬出一大堆古今中外的大文豪來，摘用他們姓名的　尾，再配上「慕」，「效」，「亦」，「仰」等字眼，如慕基，（高爾基）效迅（魯迅）亦白（李白）仰沙（沙氏比亞）……諸如此類，但終於全都沒用，因為畫虎不成反類犬，豈非反而沾辱了他們的大名？這一想，於是決定放棄。</p>
<p>其次，我打算以値得紀念的人物來題取筆名，固亦一舉兩得的事情。但問題又來了：以人而論，最値得紀念的當莫過於生身父母，不過這似乎又對不起心愛的太太，因為她與自己的結合是如此曲折如此驚險，但若眞以太太為紀念對象而題取一個筆名時，我又猶豫了，可不是？小林是鼓勵並帮助自己從事寫作最熱心而且也最得力的好朋友，飲水思源，怎能忘記他？因此，為求老少無欺不分軒輕起見，這個原則終於也放棄了。</p>
<p>這裏，我就想到前人所樂用的室名。古人以室名作別署的，不是枚不勝舉嗎？譬如米芾有　晋齋，蘇軾除東坡居士之外，還有雪堂一名，至袁收之以隨園著名，更是婦孺皆曉的事，於是我便決定在亭，台，樓，閣，齋，室，堂，應之類的字眼上用功夫。只是筆名還未取得，倒已有飄飄然羽化而登仙之概了，我懷疑自己是否够得上做這麼一個『雅士』了。正躊躇間，偶然翻到板橋家書裏的一段話：「近世詩家題目，……某軒，某園，某齋，某樓，某岩，某邨，某　，皆市井流俗不堪之子，今日纔立別號，明日便上詩箋。其題如此，其詩可知！其詩如此，其人品更可知！」拜讀之餘，汗流浹背，於是連忙拋開萬途徑，趕緊另覓新題材。</p>
<p>天哪，我感到迷惘了，我不禁　筆三嘆：時至今日，方知文人之可為而不可為也！</p>

<h3>贈曲中人—聯語新話之七</h3>

<p>嵌字之聊，以贈曲中人為多，集成句盛傳一時者，如：「小於么鳳輕於燕，雲想衣裳花想容。」嵌小雲二字，人所共知也。若嵌如意二字，則「都道我不如歸去，試問卿於意云何。」相傳為湘鄉遊漢口時，有勸其作　計者，故如此云。嵌「大姑」二字，則「大抵人生若夢，姑從此處銷魂。」相傳為彭剛直作，語意豪放，固文如其人也。昔吳中有才士某，名孝廉也，或云即某科狀頭，初捷秋　時，薄游漢皋，曲中有姊妹花，長名牡丹，次名芍藥，才士眷戀其姊，樂而忘歸，一日酒酣，忽曰：「汝二人以花為名，雖雅實俗，吾欲改之以花君花相，命意仍用二花，而字面則較新頴，二人自更名後，艷名益嗓，才士屢作歸計，而久久不忍去此溫柔鄉，花君謂之曰：「君旣為吾更名，盍作一嵌字聯乎，某乃集唐詩成句云：「花開堪折直須折，君問歸期未有期。」集句不難，而難在口吻適合。花相激之曰：「能再為我集一聯乎？」某曰：「是何難，出句仍用花開堪折直須折，對以相見時難別亦難。」則得之矣。此聯天然集合，偕用相字，較化君一聯借用君字，尤為巧不可階，然尙不如吾禾鶼巢太史所作一聯，尤能面面俱到也。（上）</p>

<h3>敎育失敗論</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>「現在做惡事的都是受過敎育的人，黃包車夫不會做漢奸，貪官汚吏要讓留學生來做才格外有聲有色，……」諸如此類的話，　以名之，名之曰「敎育失敗論」。</p>
<p>說這些話的沒有想到，如果　　　　　　　之中，沒有半數以上是文盲，那些漢奸與貪官汚吏決不能那樣猖獗；老百姓不會讓他們那樣猖獗的。他們更沒有想到多多少少知識分子在敵偽時期殺身成仁，多多少少知識分子憑着敎育所給他們的一點信仰，在最混濁的環境之中，還艱苦支特，潔身自愛。</p>
<p>他們正如看見歷史上幾個偉人出身可疑，就以為凡是私生子必是天才一樣。看見作惡的人是受過敎育的，就認為敎育已經失敗，等於看見馬有四只脚，便斷定凡四只脚都是馬一樣的不合邏輯。</p>
<p>敎育，敎育，敎育對於一個民族是多麽有力量的營養，我聽了敎育失敗的論調，感到憤慨。</p>

<p>至少有五六個人同時唔了一聲，顯然他們都認為跛子的預測是對的。</p>
<p>「老鍾，唉！滿口藝術，滿口奮鬥，其實根本是個小資產階級」！跛子爽快再發　上幾句。「他能吃咱們這兒的飯嗎？唉」！說三句話，他倒嘆了兩口氣。</p>
<p>左邊那張大桌子上的鈔票全理好了，紮成長長的三條。四個靑年和一個少女　退下來，隨便歇息着。</p>
<p>「在你這位悲觀主義者的眼睛裏，老鍾那樣的人，自然也是呌賣口號的騙子了」，那少女用着演戲的姿熊說：「可是，也不能一筆抺殺，這一次的國旗獻金遊行，他出的力倒眞不小，那幾輛卡車……」</p>
<p>有一個十七八歲的大孩中從口袋裏掏出口琴來，吹義勇軍進行曲？</p>
<p>「卡車！借幾輛卡車有什麼希罕」？另一位「反鍾」派份子攙嘴出來說：「他整天就是跟桂林那一班專發國難財的商人在一起混，借幾輛舊卡車來，能費他們多少錢？說起來還是為了　金　軍，名氣又子　」</p>
<p>「唉」！　子又　　　　息着。</p>
<p>「今天那幾輛卡車不全是中孚公司借來的嗎？」跛子旁邊有一個人間。</p>
<p>「是啊！所以後來咱們遊行到中孚門口，徐紹明不鶴再捐錢了！」那女孩子給他說明着。</p>
<p>「老祝就為這樣，心裏不痛快；遊行回來，他就決定單獨去招徐紹明。」跛子吿訴他們。</p>
<p>「怪不得老鍾不高興！徐紹明是他的好朋友啊！」三個「反鍾」派份子高聲地親。</p>
<p>跛子的一桌鈔票也都點齊了，有人往館長辦公室去請來了綏靖公署和市政府所派的代表，大家很方肅靜地結算着今天勸募所得的捐款，並且把他們一起藏進兩口麻袋去。</p>

<h3>The Northeast Communist Offensive Crushed: Dehui Siege Lifted, Jiutai Recovered; National Army Pursuit Force Advances in Seven Directions</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] The crisis in Changchun has passed. National Army forces advancing north from Changchun entered Dehui at 11:00 AM on the 3rd. The city was surrounded on the 23rd of last month by a Communist force of six divisions, over twenty tanks, and over one hundred artillery pieces, representing a formidable force. At the beginning of their offensive, the main force of the National Army retreated, with a portion remaining to resist. The National Army forces near Changchun then mobilized their main force and launched successive attacks. Around the 27th of last month, the Communist forces began to show signs of wavering. The fighting was extremely fierce, and finally, the siege was lifted on the morning of the 3rd and the National Army entered Dehui. With the lifting of the siege, the Northeast war situation can be temporarily paused. The Communist offensive against Changchun suffered a major setback. In the overall outcome, the Communist forces suffered over 20,000 dead and over 10,000 wounded. Under the pressure of the advancing National Army, the Communists admitted defeat and finally withdrew.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] As of now, the Communist forces on all lines outside Changchun have been completely routed. The so-called Second "Spring Offensive" by Lin Biao has been thoroughly crushed. In this battle, the National Army discovered a total of twelve Communist combat units, namely the 1st to 7th Divisions, the 16th to 18th Divisions, the Songjiang troops under Cao Lihuai, and the 359th Brigade of Lin Biao's cadre force, totaling over 100,000 troops (previous estimates of 200,000 may have been exaggerated). In the nearly ten days of fighting, the focus was always on Dehui. No fewer than 30,000 Communist troops besieged the city. According to intelligence obtained by the military, Lin Biao ordered Dehui to be captured within four days. However, after eight days of fierce attacks, they failed to achieve their goal and finally suffered a painful defeat, retreating in different directions. It is reported that the National Army pursuit force is divided into as many as seven routes. The general direction of the Communist retreat is north for those north of Dehui, northeast for those in the southeast of Dehui along the Jilin-Changchun line, and northwest for those southwest of Dehui along the Changchun-Tao'an line. These routes are generally the same routes they used for the attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] Fulongquan, northwest of Changchun and southwest of Nong'an, was recovered by the National Army at noon on the 3rd. This area is one of the important outposts for defending Changchun. Furthermore, the Communist forces in various areas are fleeing towards Qitamu, Xiushuidianzi, Wukeshu, Taolaizhao, and the Guo'erluosi Wangfu (princely residence). The National Army pursuit troops have crossed Dafangshen, northeast of Dehui.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The right wing of the National Army counterattacking north from Changchun reached the line of Sima Jiazi and Xinglong Jiazi on the 1st. The central route advanced along the Changda Road, crossing Buhai, with its vanguard continuing to advance north towards Dehui. The left-wing cavalry unit advanced towards Nong'an, Shuangchengzhi, and Huaide, searching as they went. The Communist forces in the above areas scattered at the sound of the wind, putting up weak resistance. The Communist dream of threatening Changchun has been shattered.</p>
<p>Sun Liren Arrives in Dehui to Comfort the Troops Who Fought Hard to Defend the City</p>
<p>[Report from our Changchun Office on the 3rd] Sun Liren, Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone, arrived in Dehui at 7:00 AM on the 3rd to oversee the troops. The Communist forces besieging Dehui fled in three directions: northeast, northwest, and due north. The National Army is in pursuit. The Communist forces are scattering at the mere sight of the National Army, but the results of this battle may not be as good as expected. Also, the National Army advancing north along the Changtao Line crossed Nong'an and reached Chaigang yesterday. The National Army advancing east along the Changji Line, after driving away the Communist forces in the Yinma River area, advanced further to mop up the remaining Communist forces near Jiutai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The National Army advancing north along the Changchun-Harbin Line, after breaking the Communist resistance in areas such as Hala Ha and Buhai, joined up with the Dehui garrison, which had been fighting alone, at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. The main force of the Communist forces attacking Dehui retreated in the north and northeast directions. The National Army is striving to expand the battle results by pursuing them from various angles. Under the personal guidance of General Pan Yukun, the 4,000-strong garrison in Dehui resisted the siege of Communist forces ten times their size for eight consecutive days and nights. Commander Sun Liren, recognizing General Pan's high merits in battle, rushed to Dehui from his forward command post to shake his hand.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] The Communist forces on the Changchun-Harbin Line are now retreating to the north bank of the Songhua River. Also, the Communist forces at the Songhua River bridgehead have not advanced. Furthermore, the National Army advancing west from Jilin on the Changchun-Jilin Line and the National Army advancing east from Changchun have joined forces near Jiutai.</p>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang Office on the 3rd] The battle on the Songhua River, where the main force of the Communist army is located, will soon be resolved. The Communist forces in Jiutai on the Jilin-Changchun Road began to withdraw on the morning of the 2nd, and the National Army recovered Jiutai on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] Jiutai County, in the middle section of the Jilin-Changchun Line, was recovered by the National Army at approximately 8:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. The Communist forces fled towards Chengzijie, and the National Army is pursuing them closely. The National Army advancing west from Jilin, after recovering the stations on the eastern section of the Jilin-Changchun Line, also turned north to pursue the retreating Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] On the Changchun-Tao'an Line, the National Army encountered the main forces of the Communist 4th and 5th Divisions and part of the 3rd Division, totaling over 10,000 troops, at Jiangdongwopu and Caojiafenfang, a dozen kilometers southeast of Nong'an, yesterday afternoon. A fierce battle immediately ensued. The Communist forces, caught off guard, suffered heavy casualties, and most of the Communist forces fled towards Fuyu, northwest of Nong'an, at night.</p>
<h3>Changchun Gradually Returning to Normal: Traffic Lockdowns in and Out of the City Lifted Yesterday; China-Changchun Railway Engineering Team Accelerating Repairs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] Changchun is now gradually returning to normal. City Defense Commander Mai Youqiao ordered on the 3rd that the traffic lockdowns in and out of the city be lifted starting at 2:00 PM today, allowing pedestrians, vehicles, and horses to enter and exit freely, but they must still undergo fairly strict inspections to prevent criminals from sneaking in. There is increasing trading in the grain market. Vegetables will only be available after rural vegetable vendors enter the city on the morning of the 4th. Fresh meat will be available on the market on the morning of the 4th. Among the prices of general commodities, the most volatile this week have been food and fuel. Now that sources of supply are open and traffic is flowing, prices have stabilized. However, it is generally believed that due to the Communist disturbances, materials in various counties have been almost completely lost, especially grain. Therefore, after a short period of stability, prices will likely rise again.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The China-Changchun Railway engineering team, repairing the railway day and night at the fastest speed, repaired 200 meters of track and one bridge 31 kilometers from Changchun on the afternoon of the 3rd. It is expected that the section between Changchun and Mishazi (33 kilometers north of Changchun) will be repaired and open to traffic within days.</p>
<h3>In the Pulandian Area, the National Army Takes the Initiative</h3>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang Office on the 3rd] The overall Communist offensive in the Northeast is coming to an end. In the south, in the Pulandian area, the National Army has regained the initiative. The situation on the eastern front, in Shen'an and Pingmei, is also trending towards stability. However, the National Army in Liuhe, on the Meihe-Ji'an Road, still needs to overcome difficulties. The National Army cavalry on the northwest route entered Nong'an on the afternoon of the 2nd, and the infantry arrived on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Report from our Qingyang Office on the 3rd] The National Army on the Pulandian front searched areas south of Pulandian on the 2nd to reduce the threats they faced. According to Communist prisoners, the 4,000-strong Dalian Police Team has arrived in Jinzhou to defend against the National Army's southward advance.</p>
<h3>Hu Zongnan Returns to His Post; Claims that the National Army Will Attack Yan'an Are Untrue</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] Hu Zongnan flew back to his defense area from Beijing by special plane at 11:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] The Yan'an Headquarters spokesman announced that Hu Zongnan recently deployed a major military plan, intending to concentrate forces to capture Yan'an on March 5. The Ministry of National Defense spokesman said on the 3rd, "The above rumors are completely untrue."</p>
<h3>National Army in Gansu Recovers Qingyang and Heshui Counties</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd] The two counties of Qingchang and Heshui in eastern Gansu, which had been occupied by the Communist forces, were recovered by the National Army on the 1st and 2nd after a period of fighting.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xi'an Office on the 3rd] The Communist forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have recently been frequently redeploying in the eastern Gansu area. It is reported that a large force has been transferred from Yan'an to Qingyang, Heshui, and Xihua, south of those areas, in Gansu Province to strengthen defenses. Jiuyuan, northwest of Zhengning County, and the northeastern and northwestern areas of that county, close to the Shaanxi provincial border, have been harassed by Communist forces. The defending troops intercepted and blocked them, and recovered Chichengzhen, 20 kilometers south of Qingyang, and Yimaguan, 40 kilometers southwest of Qingyang, on the 1st. This pass is a major thoroughfare between Qingyang and Jingchuan.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan to Hold Routine Meeting Today; Constitutional Law and Regulations Committee to Hold First Meeting Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Stuart Arrives Back in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] Ambassador Stuart flew from Hong Kong at 11:00 AM on March 3rd and arrived in Beijing at 5:00 PM. Song Ziwen hosted a banquet for Ambassador Stuart at 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Wuhan Times Office Smashed; Because Their Views Angered a Neighbor</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hankou Office on the 3rd] At 8:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the Wuhan Times office was suddenly smashed by a crowd of over fifty people wearing short coats and carrying a banner reading "Hubei People's Anti-Insult Movement Congress." According to the newspaper's president, Dai Zhen, the crowd arrived in formation, stating their intention to smash the office but not to injure anyone. The total damage is estimated at nearly one hundred million yuan. By the time the police arrived, the crowd had already left, leaving only the banner and several leaflets, accusing the newspaper of selling out the personality of the Hubei people and publishing text that violated the "Anti-Insult Movement Congress." Afterwards, reporters from the Shanghai newspaper visited the security authorities and Sun Weiru, the deputy director of the Xingyuan, and Wang Tianming, the chief of staff. They stated that the case had not yet been reported, but from a security standpoint, it was unfortunate, and they would immediately investigate it thoroughly. Also, the local newspaper association is convening an emergency meeting to discuss issues related to this case. The newspaper has also decided to find another printing factory to continue publishing.</p>
<h3>Situation in Taipei Stable: Highway Buses Resume; Minor Disturbances in Tainan and Taizhong</h3>

<h3>Center of Shandong Battlefield Shifts East; Fierce Battles in Tanjiafangzi, Zuoshan, and Other Places; National Army in Hebei Province Advances South, Approaching Wanxian County</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jinan Office on the 3rd] The area outside Jinan has been fairly quiet for the past few days. However, in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, from Tanjiafangzi in the west to Jiaoxian in the east, the war has fully broken out since the 1st. The Communist forces used to attack the outer ring of Weixian were divided into three routes. One route consisted of the 15th New Regiment, the Joint Defense Brigade, the Jiaoji Brigade, etc., totaling 5,000 troops, attacking Tanjiafangzi Station, 13 kilometers west of Xinle, and Tianma, 10 kilometers north of it. Another route followed the Liyi Highway south from Huibu, attacking Changyi, northeast of Weixian. After inflicting heavy casualties on the Communist forces, the National Army in this area has transferred to the mountainous area near the south of the city. Another route, consisting of the 5th and 6th Relief Divisions and the 3rd Police Brigade, etc., totaling over 10,000 troops, with over ten artillery pieces, attacked Zuoshan Station, 30 kilometers southeast of Lixian. As of the evening of the 2nd, fierce fighting was still ongoing. In addition, fierce battles have also broken out since the evening of the 2nd in Leigou, Xia Zhuang, north and south of Gaomi, and Wanghuangmiao, northwest of Jiaoxian. At the same time, a large force of Communist troops was transferred east, north of Yidu in central Shandong. Another large force of Communist troops was discovered continuously in Yangjiaogou, north of Shouguang. Judging by their actions, it seems that they first plan to sweep the entire Jiaoji Line, combine the Communist forces in eastern Shandong and central Shandong, and then attack Jinan and Qingdao.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Office on the 3rd] There were no major changes in the Jinpu Railway situation on the 3rd. The National Army in Wenshang and Qufu continued to consolidate their new positions on the 3rd. The battle situation will develop significantly in a day or two. Also, there are no traces of Communist forces on both sides of the highway from Haizhou to Linyi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] The National Army in the central area and on both wings of the Jinpu Railway has been conducting extensive search-and-mop-up operations for days and has achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office on the 3rd] Laiyuan, at the foot of the Taihang Mountains in southern Chahar, was occupied by the National Army on the 28th of last month and is continuing to be mopped up. There are currently no Communist forces in the mountainous area from Yixian Zijin Pass to Laiyuan. The troops that recovered Mancheng continue to search. A part of the Communist forces, consisting of two brigades, has sneaked into Xinle, south of Shijiazhuang. In addition, near Changxindian, south of Beiping, seven Communist brigades were discovered on the morning of the 3rd, but they actually number less than 4,000 troops and are attempting to attack Changxindian.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office on the 3rd] Shunyi County, on the Beiping-Gubei Line, was attacked by over 1,000 Communist troops last night. They retreated at dawn. A section of the railway near Zhangxin Station was destroyed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] The National Army stationed in Jiangchengzhen (southwest of Baoding) continued to attack Dagudian (15 li south of Mancheng) on the morning of the 1st, encountering over 10,000 Communist troops. A fierce battle ensued. The Communist forces suffered thousands of casualties and fled south in panic. The National Army recovered Dagudian at 10:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd and took advantage of the victory to pursue south, now approaching Wanxian County.</p>
<h3>Engine Derails on Beiping-Baoding Section</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] An engine derailed at the 118-kilometer mark of the Beiping-Baoding section on the 3rd. Passenger trains to Beiping are temporarily suspended today.</p>
<h3>Communist Personnel in Beijing and Shanghai Are Gradually Withdrawing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] According to sources from the American embassy, the withdrawal of Communist personnel in Nanjing began on the 2nd. Three planes flew to Yan'an on that day, carrying Communist personnel and five family members. According to the American embassy spokesman, the withdrawal is currently proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>[News from our correspondent] After the list of Communist personnel withdrawing from Shanghai was submitted the day before yesterday, it was decided that they would take the express train to Beijing at 7:00 AM tomorrow. The Garrison Headquarters will send personnel to provide adequate protection along the way. After arriving in Beijing, they will join the Communist personnel in Beijing and, on the 7th, the American side will send five military planes to return them to Yan'an. As for whether the Communist representative to the Executive Headquarters should also withdraw at the same time, military and political authorities are requesting instructions from Nanjing. The former sites of the Communist office on Sinan Road and the Xinhua Daily office on Hankou Road will temporarily be guarded by the police stations of each district. Furthermore, a responsible official of the Garrison Headquarters stated: If there are still Communist secret agents in the southern district causing trouble, they will be arrested.</p>
<h3>Dong Biwu Went to Beijing Yesterday, Still Attempting to Delay the Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] Communist representative Dong Biwu, who had gone to Shanghai to negotiate about the negotiations, returned to Beijing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd because the withdrawal was imminent. He received strict protection along the way. After resting at the Lianluo Office in Meiyuan New Village, he immediately visited Zhang Zhizhong, still attempting to make a final effort to delay the withdrawal date. He then visited Zhang Qun to discuss the issue of transportation for Communist Party personnel in Chongqing and Chengdu. He returned to the Lianluo Office after visiting Bu Lizhi. Dong is scheduled to bid farewell to all parties at noon on the 4th and is scheduled to leave Beijing by plane on the 7th. There are still 25 people at the Beijing office, all of whom plan to leave Beijing on the 7th. A roster of personnel at that office was sent to the Capital Garrison Headquarters on the morning of the 3rd. This roster includes the forty-plus people who withdrew to Yan'an yesterday morning. There are currently 25 Communist Party members waiting to leave Beijing by plane.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] It is learned that regarding the limited withdrawal order, the Nanjing Communist delegation recently sent a letter in reply to the Capital Garrison Headquarters, stating: "The air transport provided by the American side cannot be fully allocated within the time limit set by your department and must be extended to the 7th of this month. If the weather is not a problem, the personnel and family members of our office remaining in Beijing will definitely fly to Yan'an on the 7th. We are now sending two copies of the roster of the personnel of our office remaining in Beijing and the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, as well as a list of transportation, radio stations, and pistols, for your review. As for the transportation of our office, which was originally purchased, we plan to entrust the Democratic League to keep it in custody. The three self-defense pistols were originally for the representatives' use."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, issued a statement yesterday on the withdrawal of Communist personnel and the overall reorganization of the government, stating: The Communist Party's refusal to recognize any agreements concluded by the government after June of last year is the main reason for the government limiting the Communist Party's stay of personnel. Since the National Government is the legitimate government recognized by the international community, it has the right to conclude treaties with any country. Now the Communist Party suddenly declares that it does not recognize the legal basis of the said treaties, which is equivalent to not recognizing the legitimate status of the National Government. From this point alone, it can be seen that the Communist Party obviously has no sincerity in resuming peace talks with the government. The withdrawal of Communist personnel is, of course, the proper move.</p>
<h3>Communist Personnel at the Executive Headquarters Have Not Yet Decided Whether to Stay or Leave</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] After the Communist personnel stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing were ordered to withdraw completely before March 5, the Communist representatives participating in the Executive Headquarters relief work have not yet decided whether to stay or leave. It is learned that Wu Yunfu, the Communist representative to the Executive Headquarters, left the Communist office at 107 Sifu Road yesterday morning to go to work at the Executive Headquarters. Huo Bingshu, the director of the Executive Headquarters, notified the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in the name of the Executive Headquarters. Huo also went to Beijing last night to request instructions from the authorities.</p>
<p>[News from our correspondent] Regarding the rumor that Director Huo would also resign after President Song Ziwen resigned, reporters inquired with relevant parties in the department. It was stated that Huo had no intention of resigning and that the rumor was untrue.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Flies by Plane to Inspect the Front Lines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] Commander Du Yuming flew by plane to various places on the front lines at 2:20 PM on the 1st, inspecting for a total of two hours and twenty-five minutes before returning to Changchun. When the plane flew low and circled over various places on the front lines, Du witnessed the Communist forces fleeing. Du believes that they were very embarrassed.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou and Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters Abolished; Chief of Staff Chen and Gu Zhutong Arrive in Xuzhou; Xue Yue to be Transferred to a Senior Position in the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Office on the 3rd] The Central Government, in order to accelerate the completion of the troop reorganization and road restoration plan, due to the settling of northern Jiangsu, the restoration of the glory of eastern Henan, and the changing situation in Hebei and Henan, has abolished the Xuzhou and Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters. The pacification tasks in the area covered by those two pacification headquarters will be carried out by Commander-in-Chief of the Army Gu Zhutong, who will be stationed in Xuzhou to oversee and advance the situation. A command post will be established in Zhengzhou-Kaifeng, and Deputy Chief of Staff Fan Hanjie will be stationed in Zhengzhou to command. General Xue Yue will be transferred to an important position in the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Office on the 3rd] Many generals are gathering in Xuzhou. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng and Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, Director Xue Yue, and others arrived in Xuzhou by special plane from Beijing at 10:20 this morning. Deputy Chief of Staff Fan Hanjie and others, who came to Xuzhou from Zhengzhou last night, all went to the airfield to greet them. After Gu got off the plane, he drove to the Pacification Headquarters and had lunch with senior generals in Xuzhou, such as Ou Fan and Wang Zhonglian. Chen and Xue inquired in detail about the situation on the front lines in western and southern Shandong.</p>
<h3>The National Army's Strong Fighting Power is Increasingly Proven in Defeating Communist Offensives in Various Areas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] After Chen Yi's defeat in southern Shandong, in order to stabilize internal morale and reverse the declining situation, the Communist Party launched a propaganda war of spreading rumors and a large-scale offensive propaganda war in the vicinity of Jinan and in the Northeast. They fabricated results of battles and amplified propaganda in order to divert attention and confuse the audience. However, their offensive on the Jinan front remains unsuccessful to this day, and the offensive has stalled. In the Northeast, the Communist Party mobilized 250,000 troops and launched a full-scale invasion, attempting to restore their reputation and expand the rebellion. They completed preparations on the 20th of last month and invaded south across the Songhua River. The National Army, in order to lure the enemy deep and inflict a heavy blow, except for leaving a small number of troops at the bridgehead north of the Songhua River and in Dehui, gradually retreated. The Communist forces thought they had succeeded and reached the line of Mishazi, Wanbaoshan, and Xiaohelong on the 27th. At that time, the National Army at the bridgehead north of the Songhua River, after being fiercely attacked by Communist forces with more than twenty times their strength since the 21st, were still able to respond calmly and remain standing to this day. In the Dehui area, the two-division garrison has been fiercely attacked by the main force of six Communist divisions, with 21 tanks and over 100 large and small artillery pieces, since the 23rd. The National Army fought a hundred against one, repeatedly charging and killing, advancing and retreating several times, killing over 20,000 Communist troops. The Communist forces suffered this blow, and their momentum was immediately checked. The main force of the National Army completed its assembly in the area north of Changchun on the 28th and, according to the pre-determined plan, launched a sudden counterattack with thunderous force. The momentum was like splitting bamboo, and the Communist forces suffered widespread casualties, scrambling to flee north, abandoning countless military supplies. The vanguard of the National Army reached Dehui on the morning of the 3rd. The siege of that city has been lifted, and the main force is pursuing north. The Communist offensive in the Northeast, which had been preparing for over half a year, has now been completely crushed. This battle not only caused heavy losses to the Communist forces, but also proved that the National Army's fighting power is sufficient to fight against and defeat Communist forces twenty times their size. This point is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>End Party Rule and Return Political Power to the People; Third Plenary Session to Announce to Chinese and Foreign Personnel</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 3rd] Zhong Wangqijiang said that this Third Plenary Session is more important than all previous plenary sessions. This is an important key from entering the stage of training to the stage of constitutionalism.

<h3>Gold Note Exchange Rate Unlikely to Change</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding the fluctuations of Chinese stocks and public bonds in the Shanghai financial market in the past two days, an official from the Ministry of Finance told reporters: "The rumors that this is related to the departure of T.V. Soong are excessively sensitive and have led to this situation. It will definitely calm down in the very short term." Regarding the rumors in Shanghai that the gold price listing will be adjusted recently, it is not credible, because the official price of 4.8 million taels of gold is determined based on the exchange rate of 12,000 US dollars. Therefore, if the US dollar exchange rate does not change, the gold price will not change. At the same time, the US dollar exchange rate will not change at any time."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Economic Policy Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 3rd in the temporary conference room of the Central Party Headquarters, presided over by Minister Chen Lifu.

<h3>US Embassy Notifies Yan'an; Requests Release of Two Military Officers</h3>

However, as of the evening of the 3rd, there was no telegram from Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The reporter recently visited Mr. Colebrook, the US Consul General in Harbin, to inquire about the detention of Major Rick and Captain Collins by the Communist army. According to reports, Major Robert Rick, Deputy Military Attaché of the US Embassy in China, and Captain John Collins were driving a jeep at noon on the 1st when they were stopped and detained by the Communist army in Dajiazi Village, four kilometers southeast of Kalun (23 kilometers east of Changchun). According to the driver who escaped from Changchun, the two men had not been harmed until he left Major Rick and others, so he believed that they were only detained by the Communist army and would be released in order. As for their current location and status, nothing was known as of the 2nd. Consul General Colebrook continued: "We still do not know the exact circumstances of these two US military officers after they were detained." He said: "The US is now questioning the Communist side through the CCP office in Nanjing, which is about to withdraw. We believe that Major Rick and Captain Collins will be able to safely return to Changchun in the short term.

<h3>Government Decides to Reorganize Early; Completion Possible Before the Opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee; Lei Zhen, Zhang Junmai, and Others Arrive in Nanjing to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Central figures have stated that the government reorganization plan will be expedited. It is generally believed that the reorganization can be completed before the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee on the 15th. Lei Zhen has discussed the government reorganization plan with various parties in Shanghai and has achieved results. Mr. Lei, along with Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, and others, will arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 4th to consult with the central government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, returned to Nanjing by night train yesterday. Before leaving, he told reporters that the government does not want only the Youth Party to participate in the government alone, so he was ordered to come to Shanghai to invite representatives of the Social Democratic Party to Nanjing. Most of the party's standing committee members are in Nanjing to discuss with the government, hoping to make a decision on full participation. As for the manner in which the Nanjing talks will be conducted, whether the two parties, social figures, and government representatives will gather together to discuss the overall reorganization; or whether individual negotiations will be conducted, it will be decided entirely by the Chairman, and I cannot answer.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Social Democratic Party, and the standing committee members remaining in Shanghai took the night train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM last night to discuss the overall reorganization of the government with the authorities. They plan to stay in Nanjing for two or three days, which may be extended if necessary. According to reliable sources from various parties, although the Social Democratic Party made a decision at the standing committee meeting the day before yesterday to limit participation in the government to four institutions, if the authorities can provide a guarantee to abolish one-party rule, the party's full participation does not necessarily have to be after the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. It is heard that among the standing committee members remaining in Shanghai, very few firmly advocate not participating further. Most advocate conditional participation, such as the government enabling the Social Democratic Party to participate in the secrets of national defense, diplomacy, and finance, so that they can understand the actual situation of national affairs. It is generally believed that there are still ways to deal with finance during the transition period, and that internal strife is not caused by the Social Democratic Party's participation in the government, so joining the government will not "take the blame for others." In addition, Mr. Zhang Jia'ao's visit to the south has had a considerable impact on Mr. Zhang Junmai's attitude, so if the authorities can sincerely invite him, the negotiations in Nanjing are expected to yield concrete results.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, and Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, returned to Nanjing by train at 11:00 PM last night. Among those traveling with them were Zuo Shunsheng and Zhang Bolun of the Youth Party, and Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Wan Renqian, Feng Jinbai, Tang Zhuxin, Sun Baogang, Ji Yiqiao, Lu Guangsheng, Wang Shiming and twelve other people of the Social Democratic Party. Li Huang of the Youth Party will also go to Nanjing in the next day or two due to matters in Shanghai. After all the central standing committee members of the two parties, the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party, arrive in Nanjing, they will meet with the central standing committee members of the two parties remaining in Nanjing to conduct important negotiations with the highest authorities on further reorganization of the government. Zhang Junmai said: "Regarding our party's attitude towards the government reorganization, it is still the same as stated in the previous statement on participating in four institutions. This trip to Nanjing will first listen to the government's opinions before making a decision." He said that he only intends to delay for one day in Nanjing before returning to Shanghai, because he must make full preparations before going to India to participate in the Asian conference.</p>
<p>[Also] The Democratic League decided yesterday not to submit Zhang Lan's letter to Chairman Chiang, but will issue a statement to the outside world within days, detailing the Democratic League's attitude towards the current situation. The draft statement was taken to Nanjing by Ye Duyi last night to solicit the consent of the Democratic League members remaining in Nanjing before it can be published.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Denies Presiding Over Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, on the 3rd and asked whether it was true that Zhang was ordered to preside over the reorganization of the government and was appointed as Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Chairman Zhang replied: "I have participated in discussions on the reorganization of the government, but I have not been ordered to preside over it. All kinds of rumors are unfounded, but I am sorry that these newspaper reports have increased a lot of work for my secretary."</p>
<h3>Fellowship Meeting of Students from the Central Training Corps in the United States; He Yingqin Delivers a Speech to Encourage; Should Study and Research Practical Problems More</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing, New York, 2nd] There are more than 100 members of the New York branch of the Central Training Corps Alumni Association in the United States, spread all over the United States. Today, they held a fellowship meeting at the "Lushun Restaurant" here. A total of thirty-one members attended voluntarily. General He Yingqin delivered a speech on the spot, saying: "There are four factors that have made the United States the richest and most powerful country in the world, namely, the high level of dedication of civil servants, the close cooperation between the people and the government, the excellence and foresight of planning, and the tradition of democracy." General He also analyzed the differences between Chinese and American rural areas, saying: "I have traveled through fourteen states in the United States and often feel that Chinese farmers are fifty years behind in life. This is really unfortunate. When I arrived in northern Kodak, I investigated the American land system and found that the poorest American farmers also own 240 acres of land, which is six times more than the land owned by my family in Guizhou Province, but the Chinese Communists still refer to me as a big landlord. This shows how pitiful the Chinese are."</p>
<p>General He Yingqin encouraged the students of the Central Training Corps to study the academic subjects that China urgently needs and to jointly study China's problems, such as improving agriculture, in a practical way. In short, they must use their time to serve the motherland in a useful way and try to correct the American people's misconceptions about China.</p>
<p>General He also said: "The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee will open on March 15th. He has made a proposal calling for the development of China's agricultural economy, the improvement of farmers' lives, the implementation of our party's policy of 'land to the tiller,' and the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood through scientific methods."</p>
<p>According to General Bao Yingqin's words to reporters: "He has just returned from a visit to the West Coast and has inspected the agricultural conditions in fourteen states. The suggestions he has made to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee have been telegraphed to Nanjing, totaling about 1,000 words, and the important reference materials are all taken from the documents of the US Department of Agriculture." When asked about his observation of the current war situation in Shandong Province, he said: "Although there are difficulties at present, I firmly believe that the national army will be able to complete its mission." General He said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the future of the country will definitely be optimistic."</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about the reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense, he replied that it was purely a rumor.</p>
<p>General He expressed satisfaction and thanks for the speed with which Shen Bao was delivered to overseas readers (reaching them in seven days).</p>
<h3>Most of the 20,000 Overseas Chinese in Japan Live in Extreme Hardship</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Li Binghan, Director of Overseas Chinese Affairs of the Chinese Mission in Japan and former Specialist of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently issued a statement saying that there are approximately 20,000 overseas Chinese in Japan registered with the mission, most of whom live in "extreme hardship." Half of the registered overseas Chinese are Taiwanese, all of whom are small businessmen and restaurant owners. There are now more than 700 restaurants opened by Chinese in Japan. Li continued: "Overseas Chinese, like other Allied overseas Chinese, enjoy privileges in Japan, so they can obtain a large number of rations. Although Chinese overseas Chinese are not subject to Japanese criminal law, there are still 300 Taiwanese in Japanese prisons because American prisons cannot accommodate them. For the sake of the prestige of the Chinese government, they should be sent back home together with the unemployed, poor students, and those who voluntarily repatriate. Some of the traitors captured in Japan will also be transported back home for trial."</p>

<h3>Five Public Trials End in Debate; Tani Hisao to be Sentenced on the 10th; Looked Flustered and Depressed After Hearing the Court Order</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The fifth public trial of the Nanjing Massacre case began at 2:00 PM on the 3rd and continued to debate. Tani Hisao first refuted, repeating his words, completely quibbling, and his defense was lengthy, lasting for one hour and fifteen minutes. His main points were still the following: (1) The residents near Zhonghua Gate had already fled due to the fierce fighting. From a war point of view, the so-called massacre is not something that anyone can admit. (2) Tani's troops were stationed in empty houses or schools. (3) Tani patrolled outside on the 17th, 18th, and 19th and did not see any incidents. If there were any, it was after Tani left. (4) The location of the collective massacre is unknown, completely fabricated. Most of the three major incidents were within the stationing area of the 114th Division, and he requested that relevant personnel such as Yanagawa be called as witnesses. After he finished speaking, the translator continued to translate the unfinished arguments from the previous time. The prosecutor then refuted, and the lawyer Zhang Rende defended him. The presiding judge then declared that Tani was guilty of participating in military conspiracy, etc. Tani then made a final defense, roughly in four points: (1) It was a duty that could not be resisted to come to China to fight. (2) The Nakajima unit and Tani's unit are completely different and could not have committed such acts together. (3) The planned massacre at Zhonghua Gate cannot be admitted. (4) All the events were committed by other troops. When Tani submitted his final defense to the court, the presiding judge announced that the sentence would be announced at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. After hearing this, Tani looked flustered and hurriedly shouted that the sentence was being pronounced so quickly. He then made a request to call relevant personnel such as Yanagawa to testify in court and investigate the matter clearly. By that time, it was 7:30 PM, and the court was adjourned. Tani was taken back into custody after five hours of trial. His consistent arrogant and domineering attitude has now had to be replaced with depression. Everyone believes that Tani's crimes are so heinous that he will definitely not escape death.</p>

<h3>German Philanthropist John Rabe Saved Our Compatriots During the Fall of Nanjing: Mayor Shen Plans to Invite Him to China for Rest and Recuperation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd dispatch] Mayor Shen Yi previously learned that the German expatriate John Rabe spared no effort to save our compatriots during the fall of Nanjing, despite the hardships and dangers. Such humanitarian and righteous actions are truly admirable. Since Germany's surrender, Rabe's whereabouts have been unknown. Therefore, he has requested relevant authorities to inquire about Rabe's residence, intending to find a way to bring him to China to live in peace and spend his remaining years, supported by the municipal government, as a small token of gratitude for his great compassion back then. Later, according to news from Berlin, Rabe was sent to a concentration camp by Hitler for helping our Chinese compatriots and upholding justice after returning to Germany. He was released only after the Nazi surrender, and he faces hardship in terms of food and clothing. He is currently still working at the Siemens factory in Berlin (British-occupied zone). Upon hearing this news, Mayor Shen decided to purchase food as quickly as possible and send it to Rabe in Berlin via Switzerland to ensure he would not suffer from lack. At the same time, he will also seek Rabe's opinion and invite him to come to China for rest and recuperation.</p>

<h3>The Signing of the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) today, the Anglo-French alliance treaty will be signed in Dunkirk, a place with historical significance. The signing of this treaty is taking place on the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The French delegation to the Moscow Conference has extended their trip to Moscow for the signing of this treaty. Dunkirk holds deep significance for both Britain and France in World War II, and the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty in this historic city will undoubtedly evoke a profound sense of communion among the people of Britain and France. According to news reports, the treaty is valid for fifty years, and its important provisions include: (1) If Germany adopts an aggressive policy or any measures that endanger the security of both countries, Britain and France will decide to adopt coordinated policies to resist them; (2) If Britain or France is at war with Germany, whether to prevent German aggression or to implement resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, the other party must provide military assistance; (3) If Germany fails to fulfill its obligations in the future, the two countries must reach an agreement on how to deal with Germany; (4) Britain and France should consult with each other and decide on actions regarding economic issues of concern to each other. Based on these four points, it is clear that the purpose of the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty is to prevent Germany from rising again. Regarding the signing of this alliance treaty, we hereby state our views as follows:</p>
<p>The first thing we must point out is that some people believe that the purpose of the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty is to form a Western European alliance to counter the Soviet Union. Looking at the main provisions of the Anglo-French alliance treaty, its purpose is more accurately described as targeting Germany rather than the Soviet Union. France and Germany are adjacent to each other, and France has fought against Germany twice in the past thirty years; France has always harbored a sense of fear towards its eastern neighbor. Now that Germany has surrendered, in light of the experience of World War I, the Fourth French Republic has always been wary of its neighbor east of the Rhine; in order to prevent the recurrence of this painful experience and to prevent France from being invaded by Germany again, the Anglo-French alliance treaty has been signed. Its purpose is more accurately described as preventing the resurgence of Germany rather than preventing the further expansion of Soviet power, so the signing of this alliance treaty is definitely not a combination of an anti-Soviet Western European bloc.</p>
<p>France and Germany were originally brotherly nations; in the era of the Carolingian Empire, France and Germany were one family, with no distinction between them. After the collapse of the Carolingian Empire, the histories of Germany and France embarked on different paths; during this time, the emotions between the two nations became increasingly deteriorated. To this day, France's policy towards Germany is still to prevent the resurgence of a unified and powerful Germany. Today, France's policy towards Germany is still to advocate the separation of the Ruhr region from Germany, the annexation of the Saar region to France, the internationalization of the Rhineland region, and the federalization of Germany, as well as the demand for appropriate reparations. All of these measures are aimed at making the re-emergence of a strong and unified Germany impossible. The signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty is aimed at preventing the re-emergence of this strong and unified Germany. We do not wish to discuss whether France's adoption of this policy towards Germany and Britain's alliance with France as a result are wise and well-considered; however, international treaties, especially alliance treaties, undoubtedly benefit both signatory countries. Otherwise, there would be no need to sign such a treaty. It is under these mutually beneficial conditions that we see the conclusion of the Anglo-French alliance treaty.</p>
<p>Regarding the future of Germany, it is undoubtedly tied to the peace of Europe and even the entire world thereafter. Since the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty is aimed at Germany, its significance must be fully understood from a broader perspective. First, the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty complements the Anglo-Soviet alliance and the Franco-Soviet alliance. There already exists an alliance relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union and France and the Soviet Union, but it would have been regrettable if Britain and France, as traditional allies, did not have an alliance relationship after this war. The Anglo-French alliance was advocated as early as two years ago, when relations between Britain and France were quite tense over the issue of Syria and the Near East. The signing of this alliance treaty fills a missing link and is something that everyone expects. Second, now that there is an alliance relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and the purpose of this alliance is to target Germany, we firmly believe that it will further lead to the possibility of an agreement between Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union on Germany. Although the United States is not a European country, it has participated in two world wars for the sake of the European situation; the United States cannot stand idly by regarding the situation in Germany. Therefore, on the eve of the convening of the Moscow Conference, making the Anglo-French alliance a fait accompli, in a sense, is sufficient to promote the establishment of an agreement among Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the European situation. The cooperation under difficult and arduous circumstances during the war should be further strengthened after the enemy's collapse in order to solidify the alliance forged during the war.</p>
<p>In this sense, what we feel is regrettable is that there are no signs of further cooperation to solidify the wartime alliance with Japan's wartime allies; and among them, there may even be some allies who are even supporting the rise of a newly emerging Japan after the war. The purpose of the multilateral alliance in Europe is to target Germany. Why can't we, in Asia, have the same post-war development as Europe among our wartime allies? In Europe, we should prevent the resurgence of Germany after the war; shouldn't we also prevent the resurgence of Japan after the war in Asia? In Europe, we see the possibility of a bilateral alliance leading to a four-power agreement; in Asia, shouldn't we also follow the example of continental Europe, form alliances, and then have multilateral agreements to prevent the resurgence of Japan after the war? We are an Asian country, and we are naturally deeply concerned about the resurgence of Japan after the war. Among China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, we should separately sign alliances; and then have a multilateral agreement between China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. The 20th century is known as the Pacific Century, and the maintenance of peace in the Pacific is related to the safety and security of the world's future, and its significance is particularly important. Under the United Nations structure, there can be regional agreements, which do not conflict with the spirit of the United Nations structure. We hope that due to the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty and the evolution of the European situation, our diplomatic authorities can also take the same initiative regarding the Asian situation, especially regarding post-war Japan.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing we must say here, that is, the most important part of the signing of a treaty is how to fulfill the treaty obligations thereafter. After World War I, there was also a period of extremely active treaty signing. However, of the treaties signed at that time, how many were able to faithfully fulfill their treaty obligations? Whether the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty can have the expected results depends on whether its treaty obligations can be faithfully fulfilled in the future. Although the signing of this Anglo-French alliance treaty received enthusiastic support in the French National Assembly, general observers in Paris are still concerned about the Communist Party's opposition to the signing of this treaty. Whether Britain and France can have a coordinated pace regarding Germany and Western Europe thereafter depends on whether the obligations stipulated in this treaty will be faithfully fulfilled thereafter. But in any case, having a treaty is better than not having a treaty. It is in this sense that we express our pleasure at the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty.</p>

<h3>Bevin and Bidault Head to Dunkirk; Anglo-French Alliance Treaty to Be Signed Today; World Public Opinion Generally Welcomes It</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to leave London by train at 9:20 AM on the 4th for Dover, where he will transfer to a destroyer to head to Dunkirk to sign the Anglo-French alliance treaty. Defense Minister Alexander and a certain official from the reserve department will accompany him.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd dispatch] French Foreign Minister Bidault is scheduled to leave Paris by special train on the morning of the 4th to meet with British Foreign Secretary Bevin in the port of Dunkirk to sign the Anglo-French alliance treaty. Bidault is expected to arrive in Dunkirk at 1:00 PM, and the signing ceremony will be held in the afternoon. Bevin will arrive in Dunkirk by British destroyer, and the Governor of the Pas-de-Calais department in France is preparing to lead a welcome party.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd dispatch] The news of the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty has aroused worldwide concern. However, the officialdoms of several countries have not yet commented. All newspapers in the nation have printed this matter with extensive coverage and have added commentary, which generally expresses approval.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 3rd dispatch] Regarding the matter of the Anglo-French signing of an alliance treaty, the officialdom here has not yet made any reactions. However, many political figures who admire the Eastern neighbor have expressed satisfaction. They all say that the joint statement regarding the forthcoming signing of the convention recently released by France and Czechoslovakia, and the explanation issued by Foreign Minister Masaryk and the French ambassador, are all enough to dispel the various doubts raised by the Anglo-French alliance. However, the general perception is that the goal of the Anglo-French cooperation is to organize a Western European anti-Soviet bloc. The reason why the reportage here publishes the news with very little coverage is probably due to this.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Greece Is Extremely Delicate; America Faces a Major Diplomatic Test; Acheson Authorized to Negotiate with Congressional Leaders</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd dispatch] It is learned that President Truman has authorized Under Secretary of State Acheson to inform Republican financial experts in Congress of the complete truth about the administration's foreign loan regarding the diplomatic crisis faced by Greece. Some Republicans have reportedly expressed sympathy with President Truman's desire to shoulder the cost of British troops stationed in Greece in order to prevent Greece from falling into Communist hands, but they are still hesitant to hand over a blank check to the administration. Representative Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, held secret meetings with Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and leaders of both parties in Congress last week to discuss the delicate situation in Greece. On the 3rd, he told the Associated Press that Acheson had been commissioned to draft a detailed analysis of the foreign financial burdens that the administration has decided on or is considering, but there is still no indication whether this study will be prepared in time to be presented at the Appropriations Committee meeting scheduled for Marshall's attendance tomorrow. At that time, Taber will scrutinize the State Department's funding request. Although the Moscow Conference is important, it is understood that the delicate situation in Greece, which President Truman and Marshall are concerned about, is the most important diplomatic issue facing the United States. The Appropriations Committee chaired by Taber will be the main factor in deciding the fate of the request for $250 million to assist British troops stationed in Greece. According to diplomatic sources, a setback in the United States' tough action in Greece would result in a serious setback at the Moscow Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd dispatch] A British Foreign Office spokesman confirmed last night that it had received a note from the U.S. government outlining the conditions under which the U.S. government is prepared to provide economic assistance to Greece.

<p>Greek Delegation to Go to the U.S. for Negotiations</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 3rd dispatch] It is learned that the Greek government is planning to send a special delegation to the United States to report to American authorities and financial figures on Greece's urgent and future economic needs.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 3rd dispatch] The government announced today that if Britain finds it impossible to continue stationing troops in Greece for three months, the Greek government should be prepared to entrust the United States with maintaining Greek troops. But at this moment, it is assumed that Britain will be able to continue stationing troops in Greece for three months.</p>
<p>Greek Army Size to Be Increased to 200,000</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 2nd dispatch] Regarding the economic aspect of the Anglo-American negotiations for American assistance to Greece, it is understood that the Greek government held a state council meeting last night to discuss the ongoing Anglo-American negotiations. According to informed sources, the Anglo-American negotiations are not only related to economic assistance, but also to the entire Greek issue. In addition, it is understood that the Greek government has instructed its ambassadors to Britain and the United States to request the United States and Britain to allow Greece to increase its army quota to 200,000 men. In addition, the rumor that the United States will lend Greece $250 million has not been confirmed by the American authorities.</p>
<h3>German Socialist Unity Party</h3>
<p>Demands the Establishment of a Central Government as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 3rd broadcast: On the eve of the Moscow Conference, the German Socialist Unity Party, controlled by the Communist Party, issued a statement calling on the German people to hold a referendum on the merger of the four occupation zones and demanding the establishment of a German central government as soon as possible. In view of the upcoming Moscow Conference, the party strongly stated that the German democratic and anti-fascist front should unite as one to resolve the current national crisis. Observers believe this statement has two meanings: (1) It shows the line that 蔨 will probably follow in the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference; (2) 蔨 is another blow to the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department to Draft Proposal on German Issues; Moscow Conference Venue Determined</h3>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd dispatch] The U.S. Export-Import Bank today submitted its third semi-annual report to Congress, stating that the Export-Import Bank has now decided that the emergency recovery loan program must be terminated. Countries that can apply to international banks for assistance should no longer apply to the bank for emergency recovery loans. The bank's future loans will be based solely on the principle of developing international trade. Loans approved in the future must be used for specific purposes so that the goal of balancing international trade can be achieved. Therefore, the remaining funds available for lending by the bank should be used to promote the exchange of goods between the United States and foreign countries. From July 1, 1945, to the end of 1946, the bank loaned out a total of $2.25 billion. During that period, Congress approved a loan amount of $2.3 billion for the bank, leaving a balance of $50 million.

The defense lawyer also stated: "The use of the atomic bomb is related to the matter of retaliation in the prosecution." The presiding judge immediately declared that documents related to the atomic bomb would not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's Diary of Nine Hundred Volumes, Valuable Content to Be Published in Summary</h3>

<h3>Moscow Conference Approaching, European Small Countries Give Importance</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Stockholm, 2nd dispatch] All small European countries are now focusing on the Moscow Conference. This feeling is particularly strong in Sweden. Official sources believe that if a third world war were to occur again, Sweden would have little chance of maintaining neutrality as in the second world war. When diplomatic conflicts occur between the Soviet Union and Western powers, Swedish policy is to take a middle path, especially in trade. The Swedish government is pleased with the agreement it signed with the Soviet Union last year and the gradual improvement of Swedish-Soviet relations, regardless of criticism from U.S. officials who fear the growth of Soviet power, and is determined to avoid becoming a vassal of any major power. However, if the East and West continue to drift apart, it will be quite difficult for this country, which is geographically in the East but has Western customs, to avoid becoming a vassal. Therefore, diplomatic authorities here generally believe that the fate of small European countries depends on whether a balance can be maintained among Washington, London, and Moscow. The ease with which the Swedish people become terrified can be seen from the mysterious rockets of last summer. Regarding the rocket news, the authorities have now disclosed almost everything. According to a recognized report from the United States, more than 800 rockets were discovered over Sweden, but qualified sources claim that detailed investigations by military experts show that the number does not exceed 3 to 5 percent of that number, and even if so, there is no concrete evidence of flying over Sweden, because no debris has been found. But these kinds of terrifying rumors give the Swedish people a future vision of new-style warfare, along with knowledge of the devastating power of atomic weapons, making them believe that the only way to achieve neutrality is to rely on world peace.</p>
<h3>Truman Flies to Mexico, U.S.-Mexico Friendly Relations Will Become More Consolidated</h3>
<p>[United Press, Kansas City, 3rd dispatch] President Truman flew back to Missouri to be by the bedside of his 94-year-old mother at Grandview. After a short stay, he returned here on the morning of the 3rd and boarded the presidential plane, flying to Mexico at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (5:00 p.m. Shanghai time). This trip to Mexico is a "goodwill" tour. Truman will make two speeches, the first on Monday night in Mexico City, and the second in Waco, Texas. The Mexican Ambassador to the United States accompanied President Truman to Mexico. These two diplomats expect that this visit to Mexico will further consolidate the already friendly relations between the two countries and show the world that the United States' Good Neighbor Policy is still effective. Mexican President Alemán will meet him at the Mexico City airport.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Penang, Hometown of Wealthy Overseas Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by the Editorial Office of this Newspaper</p>
<p>All cities in the Far East have a prominent feature. Penang, a clean and prosperous seaport on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, is known to the world as the hometown of wealthy overseas Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Originally, the British recruited Chinese laborers to work in rubber plantations and tin mines here. Now, these hardworking and thrifty Chinese laborers themselves own many plantations and tin mines, and have become leading merchants in Malaya.</p>
<p>Although it is impossible to know exactly how many wealthy overseas Chinese merchants live here, the exquisite residences you see in the western suburbs are mostly the properties of Chinese mining magnates, plantation owners, or wealthy merchants.</p>
<p>During the Japanese occupation, most of the overseas Chinese took refuge in the interior of Malaya, and now they have returned to their old homes. At present, bandits are rampant in various parts of Malaya, and wealthy overseas Chinese are often kidnapped. For safety reasons, they have moved to Penang, because overseas Chinese in Penang are protected by local military police and can avoid the risk of being kidnapped.</p>
<p>Penang is also famous like Singapore, but it occupies an important page in British colonial history and boasts the longest-running English-language newspaper west of the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>The cargo transportation here is now crowded again. The quantity of export goods is increasing monthly, and will soon reach pre-war figures. Raw rubber is the main export commodity. The quantity of automobile tires exported from Penang is second only to Singapore in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The shops in the commercial district of Penang are lined up one after another, with goods piled up like mountains, mostly opened by overseas Chinese and Indians. Although the prices are high, the quality is better than in other parts of the Far East. Before the war, silks, exquisite handicrafts, and beautiful gems imported from China were sold at lower prices than in Singapore, where all the good things were swallowed up by the large occupation army.</p>
<p>Fruits and vegetables are abundant here, but there is a rice shortage, which is the greatest suffering of the people. Rationed rice sells for only two cents per pound, but the ration is only four ounces per day for adults and two ounces per day for children, which is not enough. Rice on the black market sells for as much as five cents per pound. Sugar is not rationed and must be obtained from the black market, selling for $1.25 per pound.</p>
<p>Penang was occupied by the Japanese army in the early days of the war, but the scars left by the war are not many. The damage caused by the United Nations bombers is greater than that caused by the Japanese army. The local tin smelting plant—one of the two largest tin smelting plants in the Far East—became a military target for American Flying Fortresses and was destroyed.</p>
<p>Penang is one of the most beautiful holiday resorts in Southeast Asia. Europeans and Chinese who feel that life is monotonous and tired in the interior of Malaya or in bustling Singapore often come here for sightseeing.</p>

<h3>"Foreign Tiger" Captured in Sassoon House, Major Black Market Organization Broken Up, Large Amounts of U.S. Dollars, Gold, and Hong Kong Dollars Seized; Principal Offender, a Dutchman, Taken into Custody by the Garrison Command for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Investigation Department of the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Command yesterday cracked a large-scale secret organization engaged in the black market of foreign exchange and U.S. dollars and gold at No. 118, second floor, Sassoon House, Nanjing East Road (the original site of the U.S. Information Service office), which is one of the "tigers" behind the scenes of this gold rush. A total of 332,111 U.S. dollars were seized on the spot, as well as 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, 38 large bars of gold, and many account books, remittance drafts, and stubs. The principal offender is a Dutch national named Fredrik Mysberg, 55 years old, who was also arrested at the scene.</p>
<p>The secret organization is outwardly called Abis.Co and is registered with the U.S. government, specializing in the black market trade of foreign exchange, U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollar notes, British pounds, and gold. The daily turnover is hundreds of millions of legal tender. There are more than sixty Chinese and foreign merchants among its customers. During this gold rush, the company had massively purchased more than 2 million U.S. dollars in advance and immediately announced to the public that the government's foreign exchange was exhausted and that those who needed foreign exchange in the future must purchase it with U.S. dollars. Merchants were temporarily unaware of the truth and sought it from the black market, and the company took the opportunity to raise prices, creating an unprecedented and shocking price, resulting in a surplus of more than 800,000 U.S. dollars under the company's U.S. dollar account. However, good times did not last long, and after our government implemented emergency economic measures, the company could no longer engage in speculative manipulation.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, within a few days, the company revived and continued to secretly engage in the buying and selling of foreign currency and gold foreign exchange. The company also has a branch in the United States, and at the same time, it purchases checks issued by the U.S. military at black market prices to arbitrage and obtain huge profits. Finally, the Investigation Department of our Garrison Command learned of this. After Director Tao Yishan verified the facts yesterday morning, he reported it to Commander Xuan Tie-wu and then went to the Foreign Exchange Audit Department of the Central Bank. After discussing the steps with Director Lin, the department dispatched two auditors, Ren Gai and Xu Renji, to start the operation together at 3:00 p.m. Under the personal leadership of Inspector-General Lu Kun, First Investigation Brigade Commander Wu Run-sun, Brigade Adjutant Tang Yu-yuan, Squad Leaders Zhang Hanyuan, Jin Suhua, Foreign Affairs Team Leader Zhao Guanglu, Deputy Inspector-General Cheng Yichuan, and others rushed to monitor the entrances and exits and telephone switchboards of the second floor of the building and then rushed into room 118.</p>
<p>At that time, dozens of people were gathered there, carrying out secret delivery procedures. When they saw the police officers suddenly arrive, they were all frightened. However, only 2,111 U.S. dollars were seized at that time. After the company manager, Frederick Mysberg, was arrested, 330,000 U.S. dollars, 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, 38 gold bars, and a large number of important account books, remittance drafts, and stubs were seized in the manager's office. Inspector-General Lu ordered Mysberg to seal them after counting and handed them over to the two auditors, Ren and Xu, of the Central Bank to take back for safekeeping. At the same time, two other important employees (Westerners) of the company were also taken to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>According to the account records, the company still has a large amount of legal tender. Not long before yesterday's crackdown, 600 million yuan was transferred to the Dutch Bank. At the same time, Mysberg was calm when he was arrested and asked the police officers not to involve irrelevant money in the case. The company also has several safe deposit boxes, which are said to be deposited by customers. The police officers granted his request and sealed them together with the Central Bank before the accounts are verified.</p>
<p>After Mysberg was taken to the Garrison Command, dusk was approaching. Two Western legal consultants of the company went to request bail, but they were rejected by the Garrison Command. At the same time, the Garrison Command has asked an accountant to start checking the account books overnight. As for the rumor that the company has used the name of Xinfeng Foreign Firm as a cover, it will not be clear until the account check is completed.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Evaluation Conference Decides on Detailed Rules for Differential Subsidy System; Revisions to Methods of Granting Leave for Weddings and Funerals Passed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee held its eighth meeting yesterday afternoon in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau. Attending were Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Wei, Du Yuesheng (represented by Zhu Wende), Xuan Tiewu (represented by Huang Dongsheng), Shui Xiangyun, Huang Rengui, She Jingcheng, Wu Yunzhu (represented by Tian Heqing). Also present were Li Jianhua, Liu Jingyan, Fan Zhenbang, etc. After the freezing of the cost of living index, the differential subsidy system was implemented in February, stipulating a subsidy of 73,000 yuan per person. Various factory guilds are very concerned and have requested the Social Affairs Bureau to explain. However, because there is no unified method, it is feared that disputes will arise in the future, so it was discussed and decided to issue differential wages, and the detailed rules are: (1) Piecework: Regardless of the amount of work produced by the workers, the number of working days will be used as the standard for issuing differential wages. (2) Child labor (including apprentices, skilled apprentices, trainees, etc.): Those who have been provided with free meals will not be issued differential wages for rice, oil, salt, and coal, only for cloth and sugar. Those who are not provided with meals will be given one-third of the differential wages. (3) If employees' wages are deducted for leave, the differential wages will be deducted proportionally. However, differential wages will not be deducted for sick leave. In addition, differential wages will not be deducted if wages are not deducted as a custom. (4) Factories, companies, and firms that dismiss employees and issue severance pay in accordance with the methods of the Evaluation Committee shall issue differential wages together with wages from February onwards. (5) Differential wages will no longer be issued for extended working hours and temporary processing. (6) Factories that have provided free rice in the past will not deduct the rice portion of the differential wages. (7) Differential wages will not be differentiated based on the amount of wages. In addition, how differential wages should be issued in the case of workers in the Western clothing and fashion industries during peak and off-peak months and shutdowns is still under study.</p>
<p>Next, the meeting discussed the methods for granting leave for weddings and funerals of spouses and immediate family members of workers in factories in the city. After revisions, it was passed and will be implemented after being submitted separately to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Social Affairs for approval. The main points are (1) The employee himself can take five days of wedding leave, the wedding leave for his children can take two days, and the funeral leave for his parents and spouse can take five days. (2) Those who have a long journey can be given additional travel leave. The date shall be determined by the factory. (3) Wages shall be paid during the leave period. (4) Piecework workers may refer to the provisions of these measures. (5) Factories that have already established wedding and funeral leave methods before the implementation of these measures shall continue to implement the original methods. (6) Temporary workers and contractors are not subject to these measures.</p>
<p>At the same time, two other proposals were passed: (1) The Meiguang Match Factory caused a dispute due to the transfer of employee Zhang Chunhua's work. The proposal to request the three committee members Shui Xiangyun, Huang Rengui, and She Jingcheng to persuade them to accept the Social Affairs Bureau's punishment was resolved. (2) The Meiguang Match Factory dismissed the case of worker Lu Yongrui with pulmonary disease. The resolution was: Wages equal to one month's notice period shall be issued in accordance with the Factory Law. Retirement pay shall be given in accordance with the settlement record, and relief funds equal to three months' wages shall be issued.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry Trade Union Requests Price Suppression</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Federation of Industrial Trade Unions of the Cigarette Industry, in view of the fact that workers' daily lives have been greatly affected since the cost of living index was frozen, gathered yesterday to discuss remedial measures. As a result of the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the government's freezing of the cost of living index was an unavoidable emergency measure and should advise all workers to endure it temporarily, but hoped that the government would announce the average price difference of daily necessities monthly, and also hoped that it would quickly suppress prices to be the same as in January to stabilize workers' lives. It has now been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for prompt processing. It is also reported that the association is extremely anxious that several cigarette factories have continued to lay off workers in large numbers recently and hopes that the government will quickly stop them to avoid increasing unemployment and affecting social security.</p>

<h3>Results of Research by Two Council Subgroups: Municipal Finances Cannot Be Balanced, Shortfall Reaches Over 220 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Budget and Finance Committees of the Municipal Council held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the municipal government's budget for the 36th year. Zhao Dihua presided over the meeting, attended by about 30 people, including members of both committees and heads of various municipal bureaus. Li Wenjie reported on the current budget statistics, stating that on the income side, the municipal government originally listed 143.9 billion yuan in regular revenue and 17.9 billion yuan in temporary revenue. After repeated discussions and item-by-item increases by the Budget Committee, the maximum increase could be 51.895 billion yuan, bringing the total revenue to 213.89 billion yuan. On the expenditure side, the original listing was 258.773 billion yuan, including cost-of-living allowances. However, with the continuous rise in prices, the various municipal bureaus proposed an additional 184.116 billion yuan. Adding 150 million yuan for conscription expenses, the total expenditure would be 443.0 billion yuan. The total shortfall between revenue and expenditure is 229.16 billion yuan. After inspecting the various bureaus and reviewing their reports, the committees concluded that it was difficult to further reduce expenditures. The staffing of each bureau has already been economized to the best of its ability. Therefore, it was proposed to further discuss how to make up for the expenditure shortfall. The discussion resulted in a decision to reduce the number of conscription centers for new recruits by two and the number of national guard training teams by 22 (both reduced by half), which would save approximately 2 billion yuan. However, it was impossible to decide on reducing other expenditures at this time. Furthermore, the substitute labor service fee for military service has no legal basis and cannot be collected, so this 40 billion yuan was not included. Currently, only the municipal construction donation of 28.9 billion yuan can be reconsidered. It was resolved to submit it to the general assembly for discussion. Regarding the budget increase requests from various municipal bureaus and offices, it was resolved that, based on the principle of living within one's means, the municipal government should recompile this year's expenditure budget.</p>
<h3>Three Committees Hold Separate Meetings</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The Municipal Council's Self-Government Committee held its eighth meeting yesterday, discussing four draft proposals, including organizing a committee to provide preferential treatment to the families of enlisted soldiers.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Police Affairs Committee also held its eighth meeting yesterday, discussing and resolving the following: (1) The municipal government's request for 500 million yuan for fire-fighting equipment has been delayed for five months. (2) Request the general assembly to further discuss the proposal to improve police treatment, raise police quality, and eliminate bad habits.</p>
<p>The Public Works Committee also held a meeting yesterday to review and approve the Public Works Bureau's detailed implementation rules for managing construction contractors.</p>
<h3>Council to Reconvene on the 7th, Two-Day Agenda Set</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Council's second general assembly has been scheduled to reconvene at its new location, the former Japanese Residents' Association on Peng Road, at 9:00 AM on Friday, March 7th. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for two days.

<h3>Mayor Wu Hosts Tea Party for Councilors, Hopes to Increase Municipal Government Revenue Within Reasonable Limits, Speaker Pan Suggests Municipal Donations Can Be Considered</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu hosted a tea party for the city councilors at the Ewo Hotel yesterday at 5:00 PM, attended by Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, city councilors, and heads of various bureaus, totaling about 200 people.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating: When I first took office, I said that the city's economy would decline in six months. This prediction has now come true. 1947 is indeed one of the most difficult years. On behalf of my colleagues in the municipal government, we believe that if we could resign and have it approved during this period, it would be good luck. If we are dismissed, it is small luck. The third option is unspeakable.</p>
<p>If the Budget Cannot Be Resolved, Municipal Administration Cannot Be Implemented</p>
<p>The fewer people involved in handling affairs, the better the administrative efficiency. Therefore, I reduced the number of personnel considerably when I first came. However, if ten people's worth of work is not done by ten people, then it cannot be done. Therefore, those who cannot be reduced should not be forcibly reduced. The various committees of the Municipal Council have inspected the municipal government's various institutions, and I strongly agree with this. I hope everyone will contribute their opinions as much as possible. If there is a need for reductions, the municipal government will definitely comply. Regarding the budget issue, I feel deeply sorry because, unfortunately, prices have recently soared, and the budget initially drafted is now difficult to balance. This has troubled the Finance and Budget Committee, which has repeatedly discussed ways to find a solution. However, I hope the Municipal Council will take more responsibility and allow the municipal government to increase revenue within reasonable limits. If even the minimum budget cannot be approved, then no matter who is in charge of the municipal government, it will be impossible to implement policies.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan's Reply: The Key Lies in Prices</p>
<p>Speaker Pan then delivered a reply, stating that the budget issue is indeed a difficult one. During this period of unstable prices, I dare say that no budget can be compiled for more than three months, let alone a year. The key to the difficulty lies in prices. Price controls can rely on techniques or methods, but if the national treasury's budget is not balanced, prices cannot be controlled. The central government recently promulgated emergency economic measures, the most important of which is to balance revenue and expenditure. To suppress prices, it is necessary to see to what extent the balance of the national treasury's revenue and expenditure is achieved. This is beyond the power of the municipal government and beyond the capacity of the Municipal Council. However, to find a solution in a situation where there seems to be no solution, the only way is to re-estimate the municipal government's revenue and ask the municipal government's budget and finance officials to contribute the actual collectible amounts as much as possible without concealing anything. It would be better to submit a supplementary budget when it is absolutely necessary, as the central government can also submit a supplementary budget.</p>
<p>The Mayor is Like a Big Contractor, Councilors Should Assist</p>
<p>We are unwilling to waste financial resources or start new projects during this period, but things that need to be used cannot be unused, and existing projects have to be maintained. Currently, the estimated imbalance between the municipal government's revenue and expenditure reaches 230 billion yuan. We can only live within our means, so we have to propose the municipal construction donation item for consideration. If the general assembly can pass a resolution, then we can ask the municipal government to recompile the budget based on this amount. To tell a joke, we ask the mayor to be a big contractor, commanding everything, and the municipal councilors will be responsible for explaining the municipal government's difficulties to the citizens and assisting in the implementation as much as possible.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Deputy Speaker Xu, Councilor Xu Yongzuo, and others spoke in succession, supporting the municipal government's collection of municipal construction donations and explaining the current difficulties.</p>
<p>(The attached photo shows the mayor speaking at the reception. Our report photo.)</p>

<p>[Our Report] The National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China held the opening ceremony of its fundraising campaign at the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China yesterday at 4:00 PM. Over a hundred people attended, including Mrs. Huo Shi Shu, Mrs. Li Wei Ning, Mrs. Huang Zuo Ting, Ms. Tan Ming De, Ms. Yu Qing Tang, Lu Mei Seng, and foreigners.

After the association's members read a letter from Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek stating that she was unable to attend the event, Wu Yi Fang, president of Ginling Women's College, and Mrs. Jin Long Zhang spoke successively. Dr. Wu expressed four points: (1) The National Association of the YWCA is the leading organization in the women's movement. (2) The work of the National Association is to promote recovery work in various regions. (3) The organization of the National Association is completely democratic. (4) The YWCA is an international organization. Mrs. Jin Long Zhang, who had just returned from attending the executive meeting of the World YWCA in Switzerland, listed various facts and reported on the various activities of the World YWCA. The event also featured a violin solo by Zou Ting Heng and a solo performance by Zhang Huang Rizhen. The event ended at 6:00 PM.

<h3>UNRRA Water Transport Corps: Shipping Industry Unwilling to Undertake</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The UNRRA Water Transport Corps originally intended to entrust the operation to the Shipping Industry Association, but after several months of planning, the association concluded that it would incur losses and decided the week before to have UNRRA operate it itself.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Shipping Industry Association, the UNRRA Water Transport Corps has over 100 ships, totaling 100,000 tons, many of which are damaged. Only 40,000 to 50,000 tons are seaworthy, and the repair costs are extremely high. Secondly, the salaries and other expenses of the American personnel on the ships are considerable, while the association's raised funds are only 500 million yuan, and there is a risk of losing 1 billion yuan per month. Therefore, the operation will still be carried out by UNRRA itself, and the personnel hired by the Shipping Industry Association will be employed by UNRRA.</p>
<h3>Chen Bofán Suddenly Disappears After Serving His Sentence, Affecting Family Members and Guarantors</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chen Bofán, who was previously accused of serving as a member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee and the director of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Puppet Central Political Council, has served his one-year and three-month prison sentence and has been released. When his sentence expired, the prosecutor ordered Chen to find two guarantors with substantial businesses. Merchants Zhang Benda and Kong Runjiu provided guarantees and released Chen. On February 1, the Criminal Division of the High Court dispatched police officers to bring Chen to court for questioning regarding another case. However, when the guarantors Zhang Benda and Kong Runjiu found Chen Bofán, his mother Chen Songshi, his brothers Chen Naijun and Chen Shukang, and his girlfriend Shen Qi conspired to hide Chen. Chen Shukang drove Chen Bofán to the Liu residence at 18 Yongkang Road, claiming to be negotiating business. Chen and Chen Shukang took the opportunity to escape. The High Procuratorate accused Zhang Benda, Kong Runjiu, Chen Naijun, Chen Shukang (at large), Chen Songshi, and Shen Qi of jointly concealing a traitor and filed a public prosecution against them. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday. The two guarantors, Zhang and Kong, testified that they were deceived by Chen Bofán, who took the opportunity to escape. They did not intentionally let him go and are willing to take responsibility for finding Chen and bringing him back to justice. Chen Naijun, Chen Songshi, and Shen Qi all claimed to be unaware of the situation. After the court hearing, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. Chen Songshi and Shen Qi were released on bail, while Zhang, Kong, and Chen were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Youth Party Members Accused of Being Traitors, Informant is Convicted Traitor, Claims to Also Be a Youth Party Member</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Youth Party member Zhu Weicong served as the director of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mining and the director of the Puppet Zhejiang Province Incense and Candle Tax Bureau. Lu Xihuang served as a director of the Puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and secretary of the Puppet National Economic Committee, and concurrently held positions in the Puppet Rice Grain Control Association's Dare-to-Die Team and the Puppet China Salt Industry Company. Lu Xijun is Lu Xihuang's younger brother and served as a technical officer in the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mining and a specialist in the Puppet Ministry of Construction. They were reported by Le Jiajun, a convicted traitor sentenced to three years, and were tried in the High Court yesterday. Zhu Weicong testified that he came to the occupied area to reorganize party affairs on behalf of the Youth Party. To cover up his work, he held a nominal position in the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. The Youth Party reported this to the Central Statistics Bureau for filing, and the High Court can send a letter to inquire. Lu Xijun testified that he was doing business during the occupation and had held puppet positions in the rice industry. Lu Xihuang is at large. The informant, Le Jiajun, was then called to testify, and he provided detailed information about the three defendants holding puppet positions. He also stated, "They are members of the Youth Party, and I am also a member of the Youth Party. We three families all live in the Lian'an Fang in Yuyuan Road. After the victory, they bought someone to accuse me of being a traitor, so I truthfully reported them." The court adjourned the hearing to a later date because the case still needs to be investigated, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Yan Chuntang: Sentencing Set for the 10th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yan Chuntang, who served as a supervisor of the Puppet China Film Joint Corporation, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. Yan testified: "I am 53 years old, from Shanghai. I used to run the Yi Hua Film Company and served as its general manager. During the occupation of Shanghai, the enemy and puppets established the China Film Joint Corporation.

<h3>Three Suspects in Pickpocketing and Shooting Case Finally Caught</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chai Gandong, a shop assistant at 136 Xizang Middle Road, had 400,000 yuan in legal tender stolen on the French Concession Route 22 bus on the morning of the 21st of last month. He immediately noticed the theft and stopped the bus at the back door of the Huangpu Sub-bureau, summoning the police officer on duty and the ticket seller to conduct an inspection. However, nothing was found. During the inspection, one of the passengers, a bandit, fired a shot and fled in the confusion. Afterwards, the Criminal Investigation Division of the police bureau dispatched officers Feng Xiushan and others to investigate. On the afternoon of the 23rd, they successively arrested Shen Jianqiu, Pan Changgen, and Yang Guobin in the Yunnan South Road and Linsen Road area. After interrogation, they confessed to stealing 400,000 yuan but denied carrying weapons and firing shots. However, after further investigation, it was learned that Shen had a long criminal record. From October 27, 1945, to January 12, 1946, he had colluded with the notorious robbers Shen Zhixiong, Lu Kongbiao, and Lu Wei, who had been executed by the garrison headquarters, as well as Fu Sheng, A Xing, Xiao Mao, and Lao Dai, who were at large, to rob three businesses with weapons: 16 Lane 356 on Jessfield Road, 4 Songshan Road, and the Hongxing Iron Factory at 835 Suzhou South Road. Afterwards, they stole US$400 and legal tender from various trams. The case was finally solved yesterday and will be transferred to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for trial today.</p>

<h3>Fraudulent Use of Guarantee to Obtain Vehicle License Exposed, Police Bureau Deceived, Arrested Car Shop Owner and Manager</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Municipal Government implemented traffic regulations restricting the registration of three-wheeled vehicles, the three-wheeled vehicle manufacturers in the city suffered a blow, and their business declined sharply. However, Xu Zhiqin, the owner of Jinlong Three-Wheeled Vehicle Shop at 63 Lane 779 on Chengdu Road, came up with an idea and colluded with Zhou Rongzhang, the manager of four three-wheeled vehicle rental shops, "Youlian," "Youning," "Yunfei," and "Xinxin" at 160 Shanhaiguan Road, claiming that anyone who bought a new car from Jinlong Car Shop could guarantee the issuance of a vehicle license. As a result, many people who did not know the truth fell into their trap, and the amount of car payments and license fees defrauded reached more than 40 million yuan. Wu Yuansong from Dongtai and Mei Diqing, Pan Jinmiao, and Yang Bin from Taizhou, 20 three-wheeled vehicle drivers residing at 276 Lane 409 on Zhongzheng South Road, purchased a three-wheeled vehicle from Jinlong Car Shop one after another at the end of last year. At that time, in addition to paying the car price of 1 million yuan per vehicle, they also prepaid license fees ranging from 400,000 to 1.4 million yuan. Xu issued a receipt and accompanied them to Zhou Rongzhang's place, where the car body was painted with the words "Youlian," "Youning," etc., and another license plate number identical to the one Zhou Rongzhang had already obtained was painted on each car. At this point, the procedures were completed, and they began operating. Occasionally, when the police bureau imposed fines, Zhou Rongzhang would present a temporary license identical to that of the vehicle to the police bureau for negotiation, falsely claiming that the license had been lost, in order to deceive the authorities. This continued for more than three months without being detected. However, recently, Wu Yuansong and others felt that it was too much trouble to continue this way and demanded that Xu Zhiqin provide them with a formal license, but to no avail. A conflict arose, and they reported it to the Criminal Investigation Division of the police bureau. After officers dispatched by Feng Ershan investigated, they learned the whole story. The two suspects, Xu and Zhou, were arrested and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation today.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Bank Owner: Accomplices Apprehended in Chuansha Dachang</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 8:00 AM on February 25th, Police Officer Yue Mingzhong of the Yulin Road Sub-bureau received a tip that the principal offender in the robbery case at the Asia Bank at 878 North Sichuan Road was hiding in the Wang family residence on Gujia Road in Chuansha County.

According to the confession, the principal offender is Zhu Lin, also known as Huang Koubiao, 39 years old, from Pudong. He also stated that there were accomplices residing in a small teahouse at Leijia Bridge on the northern end of Dachang. The officers proceeded to arrest Gu Lingeng, a local resident. He also confessed that he and his accomplices had robbed the Carlton Pharmacy on the lower level of the Carlton Apartments on Whitec Road last summer. He also confessed to the Asia Bank case without hesitation. The interrogation has confirmed the facts, and the case will be submitted to the Garrison Headquarters for legal punishment.</p>
<h3>Suspect in Car Theft Case Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Hui Jvche, the owner of Meihua Clothing Company at 685 Nanjing West Road, had a car with license plate number 51148.

He reported the case to the police and requested an investigation. A few days ago, Hui's driver, Cao Jinda, saw his owner's car speeding past while traveling on Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road. However, the license plate had been replaced. He immediately informed the police to stop the car and bring it to the Huangpu Sub-bureau for transfer to the Xincheng Police Bureau for interrogation. According to the driver of the car, the principal offender who stole the car is named Tian Changsong. He also revealed the location of his residence. Officers were dispatched to arrest him, and he confessed to stealing the car without hesitation. He was transferred to the District Procuratorate for trial yesterday.</p>

<p>敎部將指定國內大學　設邊疆語文系科　蘭大設蒙回藏三語文華西大學僅設藏文科</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] After the Ministry of Education's Mongol and Tibetan Education Department was reorganized into the Frontier Education Department, its responsibilities have gradually expanded. Recently, recognizing the scarcity of talent proficient in frontier languages within the country, a plan has been drafted to designate domestic universities to establish departments and courses in frontier languages. It is reported that this plan includes the National Lanzhou University and the private West China University, both of which will add such departments and courses. The frontier language department at Lanzhou University will offer courses in Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan, while West China University will only offer a course in Tibetan.</p>

<p>To what extent should children's artwork exhibition be arranged? Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>The municipal education authorities, in order to universally promote teaching activities in various subjects, held elementary school athletic meets and children's concerts last year. Recently, they are also preparing a children's labor art exhibition. The deep intention cannot be denied. The author, honored by the Education Bureau's kind invitation, was invited to be one of the preparatory committee members and would like to present some humble opinions on this exhibition of achievements, and discuss them with the preparatory committee members and the actual instructors of various schools.</p>
<p>First of all, we should pay attention to the fact that labor, art, physical education, and music teaching, in a broad sense, are all artistic teaching activities. However, from a sensory point of view, labor and art achievements are spatial, while physical education and music achievements are temporal; that is, the former is static, and the latter is dynamic. Therefore, the achievements of physical education and music teaching can only show the results on the sports field and in the concert hall, neglecting the process, and it is even more difficult to show what position physical education and music occupy in the entire educational facility, what relationship they have, and what value they have. However, in the labor and art achievement exhibition, it seems that it is not necessary to focus on the presentation of results.</p>
<p>We still remember that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Ministry of Education officially implemented the elementary school labor curriculum standards in the 21st year of the Republic of China. The elementary school education circle in our country once set off a climax of labor education research, that is, the entire education was centered on labor, so as to achieve the highest educational goal of combining hands and brains. Although the research results were covered up by the War of Resistance, labor education still occupied an important part in the wartime educational facilities. Now, labor education, which has the significance of production labor, naturally also has its importance in the education during the founding period.</p>
<p>Regarding children's art education, life beautification is its goal, and creation and appreciation are its means, which is already beyond doubt. At present, it is not a matter of theoretical establishment, but a matter of teaching practice.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, the achievements that should be exhibited in this children's labor art achievement exhibition are the achievements of children's labor art teaching in national education. In other words, what should be exhibited is the achievement of teaching—the process—and the achievement of learning—the result.</p>
<p>Under such an ideal, the achievements of teaching should include what to teach, why to teach, and how to teach. Similarly, the achievements of learning should include what to learn, why to learn, and how to learn. Specifically, the facilities in urban and rural areas are different, and the achievements are also different. Even in the same school, the three stages of low, middle, and high should also have different teaching achievements. If we start from the research of local culture, life center, production training, appreciation and enjoyment, and design creation, and integrate labor and art into one teaching, I dare to believe that such an achievement exhibition will definitely not be the old-fashioned toy stall and flower paper stall-style so-called excellent achievement exhibition, but an exhibition of the total achievements of labor art teaching research and implementation, which is of educational value, demonstration effect, and guiding effect. Otherwise, it is futile to admire and marvel at the works of a few artistically talented children. The status, relationship, and value of labor art teaching in the entire education have never been demonstrated, and it will never be possible to correct the social prejudice of people and students' parents against labor art teaching, and it will be a waste of many distinguished human and material resources.</p>
<p>We should not lightly let go of this exhibition, because this is an examination. From this, we can see how the children's labor art curriculum is implemented? How does the central national school guide the labor art teaching of various schools in the district? Are there any problems with labor art teachers? Are there any problems with equipment? In short, we want to see the achievement exhibition of labor art teaching and learning.</p>

At 3:00 PM on Saturday afternoon, the Mayor's Cup will see Qingbai face Railroad again at Yiyuan. The two sides previously met last Saturday, with Qingbai being held to a 2-2 draw by Railroad. Extra time failed to produce a winner, so the two sides will meet again this Saturday.</p>
<p>The weekend First Division League match, a make-up game from the second round, will see perennial powerhouse Tung Wah face the Military Court Soviet Union, also at Yiyuan. In the first round match, Tung Wah defeated the Soviet Union 4-2. The two sides will meet again this weekend, with the former looking to maintain their winning streak and the latter looking to avenge their defeat. A tense battle is expected.</p>
<p>In another Mayor's Cup match, You Tai will face Shanyun, also at Yiyuan. Shanyun lost to Longjie in the preliminary round, but Longjie was later disqualified by the Football Committee for using unregistered players, allowing Shanyun to advance.</p>
<p>The full schedule for this week, as well as a notice from the Football Committee, are recorded below:</p>

<p>Tonight's Basketball League: A Notable and Exciting Matchup; Navy-Marine Youth Meets Giant; Women's Division: Girls' Youth Purple Faces Zhanli Team; Hualian Plays Railroad Beijing</p>
<p>The Second Basketball League, with three matches in the women's division starting at 5:30 PM today, will continue to be held at the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets are available for 2,000 and 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The first match in the women's division will pit Girls' Youth Purple against Zhanli Team. This match is no longer of major importance, but in terms of strength, Girls' Youth Purple is stronger, and Zhanli Team will find it difficult to compete with them. Although the match will not be one-sided, Zhanli Team will undoubtedly lose.</p>
<p>Two Powerful Foreign Teams Engage in Internal Strife</p>
<p>The second match will feature a First Division showdown between Giant and Navy-Marine Youth. Both sides are foreign teams. Giant is a well-known strong team in Shanghai, with players such as Fuyuk, Taobolin, Qiang Dulai, and Pigu Nai, who have tacit coordination and abundant strength. They are also guided by Kaiji Mi Luofu, who is full of tricks. Navy-Marine Youth is based at the US Navy Port Service Office and was once awarded the Far East US Navy Basketball Championship. They traveled to Guam to compete and are also considered strong. Their players, such as Bi Tuo Qiong, Bi Tuo Xun, Folake, and Pi Sheng, have ample stamina. They have won several consecutive matches recently and are in high spirits. Therefore, a fierce battle is inevitable when they meet today. The excitement and tension are also to be expected. Although it is difficult to predict the outcome, it will indirectly affect Hualian's championship hopes. Giant lost to Hualian by eight points. If Giant wins tonight, it will naturally be beneficial to Hualian. If they lose, we can see the strength of Navy-Marine Youth. This match is one to pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Railroad is No Match for Hualian</p>
<p>The final match will be a First Division clash between Hualian and Railroad Beijing. Hualian is the leader in Shanghai's basketball scene. In this year's league, they suffered an upset loss to Chunmao in the first match. After this stimulation, their players were greatly encouraged and restored their past glory. Da Li, Adi, Lao Bao, Akong, and Xue Chong all look energetic and are likely to win this year's championship and retain the title. Railroad Beijing is a new team in this year's league. They have a northern style of play that is unpredictable and they have excellent morale, the best of all the teams in Shanghai. Their players, such as Yang Xianji, Jiang Guoping, Hu Sizhong, and Gu Zhenhua, have ample stamina. However, due to a lack of experience, they have been unable to succeed. Tonight, facing the league leader, they will be difficult to resist. Hualian can steadily secure a victory. Tonight's schedule is recorded below:</p>
<p>Girls' Youth Purple vs. Zhanli Team (Women's Division) 5:30 PM Referee: Wang Yiqiao</p>
<p>Navy-Marine Youth vs. Giant (First Division) 6:30 PM Referees: Liu Hesheng, Yang Liecheng</p>
<p>Railroad Beijing vs. Hualian (First Division) 7:30 PM Referees: Wu Zibin, Xia Zeren</p>

<p>Hong Kong Football News: Special Silver Shield Replay: Sing Tao Eliminates English Troops, to Compete with South China for Championship</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Correspondent] Last Saturday, Sing Tao A and B went out to compete for the Silver Shield final qualification, and both were forced to draw. In order to accommodate the return of the 45th Battalion of the Gold Soldiers, the Football Association strongly scheduled a replay on Wednesday this week – the 26th, but Sing Tao needed to fight with South China for the league championship on the weekend, how could they fight one battle after another after another within a week? They refused to send a team to play.</p>
<p>The whole of Hong Kong's Xing Lun also did not sympathize with this measure of the General Association, and the General Association also knew that public anger was hard to offend, and was willing to reschedule the weekend battle. Finally, Sing Tao took the overall situation as the most important, because if the Gold Soldiers were allowed to enter the final week in vain, it would undoubtedly give the Silver Shield championship to outsiders – because South China would never be defeated by the 45th Battalion, so they resolutely sent a team to fight.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Lineup</p>
<p>Today, Wednesday - the 26th, although it is a holiday, fans flocked to the coast of Copper Bay, and many people who tasted the closed door were there.</p>
<p>At exactly 4:00, the game began, and the referee was still Deng Situ.</p>
<p>Sing Tao, in view of the fact that the previous battle transferred Liu Songsheng to the front, and the defensive strength of the center back line was weakened, decided to transfer Songsheng back, and used Qixiang to string the left back, and the striker "Magic Leg" still failed to press the battle, and was forced to use Guangsen. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Yaode Wu Qixiang Hou Rongsheng Feng Kunsheng Xu Jingcheng Liu Songsheng Cao Qiuting Li Zhaorong Zhang Jinhai He Yingfen Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>The Gold Soldiers used the same formation as before, transferring the most outstanding center back to the right back to attack Qiuting, but the formation was as follows:</p>
<p>Tai Lai Di Ya Ban Li Zhi Li Gao Chen Ba Dingdun Xian Binlu Bu Luqi Lian Mashi Gao Lituo Di Ge Ni Lu</p>
<p>One Draw Each</p>
<p>As soon as the silver flute rang, the Gold Soldiers attacked first and were forced to retreat. After that, Sing Tao held on to the attack.</p>
<p>At 23 minutes, Qiuting picked over Xian Bulu and passed to Zhaorong, who topped Songsheng. Songsheng watched and shot remotely from 25 yards away. The ball came out like an arrow and went straight through the net. Although Tai Lai welcomed the ball and patted it, his hand slipped and the ball went in. Sing Tao scored first.</p>
<p>Then Zhaorong got the ball hooked by Jingcheng, dribbled straight in, and missed his footing when he was close to the goal. The four seats sighed.</p>
<p>At 35 minutes, the Gold Soldiers attacked urgently, forcing a corner kick. Bu Luqi opened it well, and Gao Lituo topped it. Yaode patted the ball out, but the enemy front surrounded the goal and attacked. In the chaos, one was grabbed back. The first half was a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>One Goal Decides the Outcome</p>
<p>After the break, the wind suddenly turned and blew urgently towards Sing Tao's goal. Domestic fans were all worried for Sing Tao. After the start, Guangsen got the ball and went to the meeting alone, cutting into the middle along the edge, but was pushed down by Di Ya in the penalty area. The referee turned a blind eye and lost the opportunity.</p>
<p>Once again, Zhaorong received the ball from Jinhai and rushed towards the goal, and was also illegally intercepted in the penalty area. The referee ignored it again, and the audience was in an uproar.</p>
<p>Until 20 minutes later, Jinhai led the army to advance again. He originally wanted to pass the ball high to the right, but Di Ya jumped to the top. The ball fell in front of Jinhai's feet. "Sanlang" crossed to Zhaorong. When he saw "Buddha" lifted his foot, the ball rolled into the left corner. 2-1, Sing Tao took the lead again.</p>
<p>After that, the wind became more urgent, and Sing Tao was forced to retreat and defend. The Gold Soldiers used long passes and rushed to the door to fight, forcing seven corner kicks. Fortunately, the generals of Sing Tao's rear defense all had transcendent performances and were able to preserve the victory. Amidst the cheers of thousands of fans, they defeated the Gold Soldiers and will compete with South China for the championship on April 11.</p>

<p>中央銀行新總裁　張嘉璈昨日就職　勗勉同人繼續努力共渡難關</p>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao Took Office as the New President of the Central Bank Yesterday, Encouraging Colleagues to Continue Their Efforts to Overcome Difficulties Together</p>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Jia'ao, the new president of the Central Bank, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at around 11:00 AM a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, he went to the Central Bank to assume his duties. He was greeted by the former president, Bei Zuyi, and taken to the president's office, where a simple handover ceremony was held. He also summoned the heads of various bureaus and departments to meet with him, and President Zhang delivered a speech, stating that President Bei had presided over the Central Bank for a short time, but during this year, he had been supporting it with great effort during the difficult times after the end of the war, when everything was waiting to be done. At present, the Central Bank is at this difficult time, and colleagues are urgently needed to continue their past service spirit to overcome the difficulties together. Then, former President Bei delivered a speech, stating that President Zhang is an outstanding talent in China's financial and economic circles. In the current environment, only President Zhang is capable of overcoming the current difficulties. From the perspective of national interests, it is fortunate to have found the right person. From the perspective of personal interests, this is really a savior to reduce my difficulties. Then, Vice President Chen Xing delivered a speech, stating that at this time of financial turmoil, no matter from any aspect, we should sincerely support the national policy. Our colleagues should work hard under the guidance of President Zhang, work together, and overcome difficulties together. After the speeches were completed, the new and old presidents immediately handed over the seals of office, and the ceremony was declared completed.</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM, the tea party began, and the new and old presidents stepped out of the president's office. At that time, the heads of the organs and leaders of the Chinese and foreign financial circles also arrived one after another to congratulate him. The new and old presidents and the heads of various bureaus and departments of the Central Bank entertained them in the meeting room on the third floor of the Central Bank. Those present yesterday included Kong Xiangxi, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiguang, Xu Baiyuan, He Dehui, Zhao Zengyu, Zhao Zukang, Li Du, Ding Guitang, Liu Bingyi, Wang Xiaolai, Li Fusun, Chen Guangfu, Qian Yongming, Zhao Dihua, Liu Gongyun, Cheng Cangbo, Song Hanzhang, Xu Xueyu, and more than 60 others. President Zhang then made a statement to the reporters of various newspapers on the situation of taking office, such as striving for economic freedom.</p>
<p>Recalling that since leaving the Bank of China in the 25th year of the Republic of China and working in the Central Bank, more than ten years have passed. Today, I am returning to serve in the financial sector and have the opportunity to learn from old friends from all walks of life. I feel infinitely happy in my heart. However, my talent is limited and my responsibilities are heavy. I hope that social elites and financial leaders will not hesitate to correct me, which is especially what I look forward to.</p>
<p>After eight years of war, our country was fortunate to have a wise leader at the top and 400 million compatriots working together, sacrificing and fighting at the bottom, to achieve the most glorious victory. However, an independent country and independent people must strive for two inseparable freedoms: one is political freedom, and the other is economic freedom. The day of victory in the War of Resistance is the day when our country and people gain political freedom. However, the economy has not yet been consolidated, and the vitality has not yet been restored. Not only has the people's livelihood not been stabilized, but there is also a great sense of insecurity. That is, economic freedom and happiness have not yet been obtained. It is necessary for our compatriots to strive for this freedom that everyone cannot do without for a day with the same spirit as the War of Resistance, so as to achieve true victory.</p>
<p>Overcome Inflation</p>
<p>Inflation is an inevitable phenomenon in wartime. After the war, sorting out the currency must go through an extremely painful process. After the First World War, there were many precedents in many countries. In this war, many countries with first-time experience used various preventive methods to reduce the danger of inflation, but they did not have the basic conditions for prevention, resulting in today's economic phenomena.</p>
<p>The methods used by European and American countries to prevent the danger of inflation are to control prices, implement rationing, support production, and save consumption. On the other hand, they increase income tax rates, promote savings, and increase the issuance of public bonds to absorb the people's excess purchasing power. Therefore, financial revenue and expenditure and material supply and demand can still maintain a balance in the midst of inflation. What we must pay attention to is that the key to their success lies in the sincere cooperation between the people and the government. The government loves the people, and the people lead the government. If China wants to escape the danger and pain of inflation, it still cannot avoid going through the process that European and American countries have gone through. What's more, although our country has won the War of Resistance, domestic peace and order have not yet been fully restored. The economic emergency measures recently promulgated by the Central Government are based on the wartime economic policies of European and American countries, and I hope that all our compatriots in the country will regard this as an inevitable process to guide them to economic stability. The key to its success lies entirely in the mutual trust and mutual assistance between the people and the government, and only sincere cooperation.</p>

<p>表現自治能力　建立金融中心</p>
<p>Demonstrate Autonomy, Establish a Financial Center</p>
<p>The Shanghai market was created by countless hardworking, diligent, and capable young shop assistants and workers under the guidance of responsible and promising leaders. It has a long and glorious history. In addition, the country's legal rights have been completed in recent years, and it is the day for our citizens to demonstrate their autonomy. I hope that we will not only strive to maintain the existing glorious history, but also work together to build an organized, orderly, and ethical financial center and commercial market. All bad habits of deceiving each other, forcibly seizing, and all speculative profiteering will be corrected and eliminated to set an example for the whole country. If this can be done, the legitimate production industry and international trade will surely flourish. Shanghai will not only become the commercial hub of the country, but also the center of international finance. The Central Bank is responsible for regulating the national finance, and its responsibility is even more arduous in this economic crisis. Jia'ao looks forward to the future and is deeply afraid that he will not be able to handle it. Fortunately, the past presidents of this bank have been well planned. The colleagues in office can also serve diligently and prudently. We can only adhere to the spirit of serving the public in the past, and do our best to be a bridge for cooperation between the government and the people. I especially hope that leaders from all walks of life and friendly countries will not hesitate to give guidance and assistance from time to time, so as to avoid damage. I am very fortunate.</p>
<p>人事並無更動</p>
<p>No Changes in Personnel</p>
<p>Reporters then asked President Zhang some questions, and he answered them. The following is an excerpt: He said that he had just taken office yesterday, and he had not yet considered the resignations of the heads of some bureaus and departments of the Central Bank, or the appointment of the successor vice president. However, he did not bring any new people to take office, so he eagerly hoped that there would be no changes in personnel. As for the positions of Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee, according to the regulations, they are concurrently held by the President of the Central Bank, so they must be concurrently held.</p>
<p>欲解工商困苦　必須抑低利率</p>
<p>To Solve the Difficulties of Industry and Commerce, Interest Rates Must be Reduced</p>
<p>[Our Report] Xu Botu, Vice Minister of Finance, answered reporters' questions yesterday. The main points are as follows: (1) The focus of future financial problems will still be on reducing interest rates. At present, if we want to relieve the distress of the industrial and commercial sectors due to high interest rates, we must issue loans. However, after issuing loans, we must also consider not allowing them to flow into speculative hoarding channels, so as not to lose the willingness of the loans. It is believed that President Zhang will be able to find appropriate methods to reduce interest rates after presiding over the Central Bank. (2) Regarding the silver building industry's request to maintain the trading of jewelry and the auditing firm's request to allow opening, although both have their difficulties, the government's laws and regulations have been established and must be strictly implemented. It is now planned to find a solution between the two.</p>
<p>市塲盛傳「禁做」消息　華股狂漲之風稍挫</p>
<p>Market Rumors of "Prohibition" Slightly Dampen the Frenzy of Soaring Chinese Stocks (The Police Department is Investigating the Account Books of Counterfeit Trading Firms)</p>
<p>Although Chinese stocks rose wildly and chaotically yesterday, the hot stocks rose too much. Once there was an external blow, they quickly fell back. In the afternoon, there were many silkworm movements due to the depletion of chips, but due to the rumors of "prohibition," they ended at a low price.</p>
<p>In the morning, the buying was very strong. Cement Xinya hit the limit. After the opening, numbers 145, 61, 217, 224, 186, 9 (up), 215 were all buying. Deyong Yarn stepped up to 2,880 yuan. Numbers 76, 145, and 207 sold at 2,830 yuan. Jingfu and Dexinhe were the first to hit the limit. Numbers 85, 199, 106, and scattered buyers all bought Deyong Yarn up to 2,940 yuan. Numbers 218 and 76 sold, falling back to 2,830 yuan. Numbers 171, 223, and 197 entered to 2,900 yuan. Numbers 76, 79, and 171 suddenly sold to 2,790 yuan. Numbers 235, 224, 211, 4, and 154 entered, and the buying spree started again. Numbers 152 and 198 entered strongly. At 10:30, Deyong Yarn rose to around 2,960 yuan. At this time, there were rumors that a major player, Hong, was selling strongly outside the market, and there were also rumors of a reduction in the US exchange rate, and a falling wind immediately rose. Numbers 231, 179, 9, 219, 91, 85, 76, 139, 125, 83, 2, and 112 were sold off one after another and fell to 2,660 yuan. It was also heard that the bond market was dispersed by the police, and that the counterfeit trading firms were being investigated. The number 3 and other banks helped maintain the low level, and the number 68 also rose to 2,820 yuan. Numbers 142, 85, 65, 76, and 112 sold again to 2,690 yuan. Numbers 31, 223, 211, 145, and 171 entered to 2,800 yuan. However, because there was a saying outside the market that it was only for settlement, the floating positions were available, and the noon was closed flat. As a result, compared with the closing price last Saturday, Yongsha Qinxing Zhongfa rose slightly, Xinhe Xinguang Huafeng Sheng Guanzhi, Jingfu rose by 10%, Meiya fell by 5%, and Xinhua fell slightly by 9%. Dexin Yongsha Xin Xinguang rose slightly, Huafeng rose by 50%, Meiya fell slightly, and the cold stock Jinglun hit the limit.

<h3>The First Batch of Conscripted Soldiers in This City Will Not Exceed 3,500</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the establishment of the Shanghai Garrison Command, it has been actively preparing for various training programs for conscripted soldiers and national service soldiers. The uniforms issued by the Ministry of National Defense have also been transported. The Shanghai Regiment Management Area under the command has two battalions and a total of ten companies, waiting for conscripted soldiers to enlist for training. According to the person in charge of the department, the maximum number of conscripts in the first phase will not exceed 3,500. However, the actual number of conscripts, age, and time have not yet received clear instructions from the Ministry of National Defense. In terms of conscription administration, the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department will establish a military affairs section in the short term, and each district will establish a district security team, requiring more than 1,300 cadres. The department has suggested to the Civil Affairs Department that demobilized officers, youth soldiers, and members of the Central Training National Administrative Class can be recruited. Yesterday, Chief of Staff Chen of the department discussed this matter with Director Zhang. It is reported that the budget prepared by the Municipal Government for the establishment of the military affairs section and district security team will be submitted to the City Council for discussion.</p>
<h3>Three Labor Unions Demand the Lifting of the Frozen Cost of Living Index; Director Wu Urges Them to Overcome Difficulties Together</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, more than 30 representatives from three vocational labor unions, including the machine industry in three districts, the silk weaving industry, and the machine industry in six districts, went to the General Labor Union to petition, making two demands: (1) to lower commodity prices to the level of January; (2) to lift the frozen cost of living index. Because Chairman Shui went to the Social Affairs Bureau to attend a labor-management assessment meeting, they turned to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. After the labor-management assessment meeting ended, Director Wu received them. The union representatives presented a formal document and requested that if the index could not be unfrozen, they hoped to increase the variety of in-kind allocations. Director Wu said: The difficulties in the lives of employees are very clear, and the demands will be forwarded to the higher authorities. However, it is hoped that employees can understand the government's difficulties and work together to overcome this difficulty. The government is implementing emergency economic measures, and this period of time is not expected to be long. The government is about to freeze the cost of living index, and it will do its best to suppress commodity prices. If it is not possible to suppress prices, workers will not be the only ones to suffer losses, and there will be other remedies after the cost of living index is frozen. He will definitely strive for the reasonable demands of the workers. Because there were many people and opinions were mixed, Director Wu decided to meet with the representatives of the three labor unions, Gu Gang, Shen Mo, and Tan Fugen, again this afternoon to listen to their opinions.</p>
<p>Regarding the General Labor Union's request to adjust the workers' cost of living index every three months, Director Wu said that he would forward it to the central government.</p>
<h3>A Fire on Tangqiao Road in Pudong Kills Four and Injures Two</h3>

<h3>Symposium on Education Issues Discusses Textbook Problems; Lu Dianyang Reports on the Compilation Process of the National Standard Edition</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] A symposium on education issues was held at Jinling University on the 2nd to discuss the problem of the national standard edition of textbooks. Lu Dianyang, director of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and the Elementary and Secondary School Textbook Editorial Committee, reported on the compilation process of the national standard edition of textbooks, as well as its advantages and disadvantages. It is said that the national standard edition of textbooks that have been printed so far include junior high school Chinese, civics, history, and geography. For elementary school, except for natural science and arithmetic, all are complete. The textbooks compiled and printed by the Ministry of Education strive for completeness in subjects and have no bias in content. This is a significant advantage. There are also several shortcomings. There is only one type in each category, which not only eliminates the possibility of comparison or competition, but also leaves teachers no choice. Some people even believe that it has the suspicion of ideological control. Subsequently, Cheng Shi, Luo Tingguang, and Cao Chu separately reported on the supply of textbooks in the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. Chen Heqin also presented American textbooks with excellent printing and rich content for the attendees to view. Finally, Yuan Boqiao concluded that, in principle, the state could compile multiple types of textbooks and allow schools to choose and apply them freely. However, the term "national standard edition" seemed inappropriate. If the Ministry of Education formulates a complete curriculum standard, experts can edit textbooks according to the standard, and the Ministry will review and approve them according to this standard. It would be more ideal for the textbooks compiled by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to also be reviewed and several types to be implemented in parallel. Wang Tongqi distributed a form to test the attitudes of the experts present. The results were: (1) No one agreed to designate the use of the national standard edition; (2) 14 people agreed to allow the selection and use of various approved editions; (3) No one agreed to designate the use of one approved edition; (4) 7 people agreed to issue the national standard edition or approved edition at the same time and allow selection; (5) 1 person agreed to use the national standard edition for certain textbooks and the approved edition for certain textbooks.</p>

<h3>Eastern Fish</h3>
<p>— Zi Liu</p>
<p>In my hometown, I used to eat a kind of salted fish called Eastern Fish. The scales of this fish were gray-yellow after being salted, and the meat was as red as ham. It tasted quite good. At that time, the Chinese people's impression of Japan was extremely bad, and there were often boycotts of Japanese goods. The Eastern Fish on the stalls would also be dumped by young students. At that time, I thought that the action of dumping Eastern Fish was very correct, and these unpatriotic people should be punished. Therefore, my interest in eating Eastern Fish was also reduced.</p>
<p>But later someone told me that the so-called Eastern Fish was not really transported from Japan, but was caught by the Japanese in the coastal areas of Northeast China, salted, and sold to China. In this way, I felt very unhappy: why should the fish in the Chinese sea be caught by the Japanese and called "Eastern Fish"?</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I had never seen this kind of fish. By the time of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I missed this kind of fish and firmly believed that the Japanese would no longer be qualified to catch such fish? And this fish would surely be renamed something of our own Chinese. But I have not seen this fish so far, which makes me feel very strange!</p>
<p>Reading the evening paper today, it says that China has established a partnership with General MacArthur's headquarters in Japan, allowing Japanese ships to fish in the Chinese overseas, Korean and Ryukyu territorial waters. We will not talk about them being able to fish in the Korean and Ryukyu territorial waters for the time being. Perhaps they will catch fish in the Chinese overseas, just like before the Anti-Japanese War, and call the fish in the Chinese sea "Eastern Fish" and sell it to the "Chinese"?</p>
<p>I really feel strange: can't we Chinese catch the fish in our own sea, and must we ask the Japanese to catch it and sell it to us? Have we forgotten that the reason why Japan was able to militarily invade China in the past was gradually developed from economic aggression, and the infringement of fishing rights was the starting point of economic aggression?</p>
<h3>"Old J.B."</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>J.B. Powell, the former editor-in-chief of the China Weekly Review, died of a sudden heart attack in Washington. Although he repeatedly expressed his desire to return to Shanghai to see his old friends, he finally had no chance to see China after the victory!</p>
<p>In Shanghai's journalistic circles, if you mention "Mr. Powell," others will ask, "Which Powell are you talking about?" Because the current editor-in-chief of the China Weekly Review is J.B.'s son, and the father and son have quite different views on China. But if you mention "J.B.," everyone knows that it must be this rather fond-of-dressing-up old Powell.</p>
<p>The time when J.B. was most prominent was during the period when the National Army withdrew westward and the "76" bandits ran rampant in the Shanghai Concession. At this time, the trend of assassinations was extremely prevalent, but the China Weekly Review invariably had an article in each issue exposing the inside story of the puppet organization—such as the dispute between Zhou Fohai and Chen Gongbo, and the infighting between Ding Mocun and Li Shiqun, which were all published to the world in an extremely vivid and incisive manner. At that time, the China Weekly Review was simply in high demand, and it was always sold out as soon as it was published every week, and there were even second and third editions.</p>
<p>J.B. certainly knew that he was in an extremely dangerous situation, so he often went out at night and hired bodyguards. He lived in the American Club, which was very close to the office of the China Weekly Review (No. 160 Edward Road). One day, probably around four or five o'clock in the afternoon, he thought that the area around Jiangxi Road near Fuma Road was very lively at that time, and he ventured to walk to the newspaper office. Just as he reached the intersection of Edward Road, suddenly a person threw a long, round newspaper-wrapped package at him. Presumably, J.B.'s suit was too "streamlined," and the package slid over his shoulder and fell to the ground. J.B. poked the package with his cane—it turned out to be a bomb!</p>
<p>From then on, J.B. was more careful, but he still often sat in front of the typewriter all night, challenging the enemy without reservation. Sometimes I would visit him, and he would suddenly ask me for my opinion on a certain event, asking very carefully and thoroughly, as if it were an exam—sometimes, these immature opinions were actually adopted, but after he "digested" them, they had become very thorough.</p>
<p>J.B. liked to dress up, and the decorations he used were extremely exquisite. He also liked to collect fake antiques and carpets. In his book "Twenty Years Out of the Country," which he wrote after the war, he often mentioned these fake antiques with nostalgia. He also often asked me how much silver I spent in college each year, and then complained that his son spent too much money studying in India. But who knew that Little Powell is now inheriting his father's ambition and has also achieved quite a lot!</p>
<p>Little Powell is called "J.W." We call him Bill. He seems to have different ideas from J.B., but he himself said: "We had a long talk in Japan about many issues, and we found that in essence we were not much different." Really, doesn't America have both Vandenberg and Wallace at the same time?</p>
<h3>Song Entering the Underworld</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Using coffins, wonderful praise obedient! The dead don't care, well arranged: counterfeit money machinery hides contraband, fanciful!</p>
<p>Arms are also stolen, how strange! How could the coffin want to become "official" and "wealth"? It's not that officials are delusional, unlucky star comes!</p>
<p>Note: Narcotics were found in empty coffins in coffin shops in Shanghai, counterfeit money machinery was found in coffins in the countryside of Wuxi, and arms were found in coffins in a nunnery in Wuhu. All of these were reported in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Story of Pen Names</h3>
<p>— Xiao Changdao</p>
<p>After my first submitted article was published, along with the boundless joy and excitement, came an urgent and strong impulse—I had to come up with a pen name for myself.</p>
<p>I considered this impulse very seriously, although I couldn't explain why. A mysterious but very strong subconscious mind kept nagging at me, and I unconsciously set a constraint for myself: I wouldn't publish any more articles until I had a pen name, as if I were already a famous writer, and famous writers almost always have pen names.</p>
<p>So, before I started writing my second manuscript, I began to rack my brains for the most satisfactory pen name.</p>
<p>First, I thought, since I was determined to become a writer, I had to not only study introductory books on literary creation but also imbue my pen name with a meaning of striving, so as to encourage myself and drive me forward. So, I brought out a large number of great writers from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, and extracted the tails of their names, pairing them with words like "admire," "imitate," "also," "look up to," etc., such as Mujie (Gorky), Xiaoxun (Lu Xun), Yibai (Li Bai), Yangsha (Shakespeare)... and so on. But in the end, none of them worked because it was like trying to paint a tiger but ending up with a dog, wouldn't it be insulting to their great names instead? Thinking this, I decided to give up.</p>
<p>Secondly, I planned to choose a pen name based on a figure worthy of commemoration, which would be killing two birds with one stone. But the problem arose again: in terms of people, the most worthy of commemoration should be one's parents, but that seemed unfair to my beloved wife, because her union with me was so tortuous and so dangerous, but if I really used my wife as the object of commemoration and chose a pen name, I hesitated again. Isn't it true? Xiaolin is a good friend who encourages and helps me engage in writing most enthusiastically and effectively, how can I forget him when drinking water, think of the source? Therefore, in order to avoid deceiving the old and the young and not taking sides, I finally gave up this principle.</p>
<p>Here, I thought of the names of studios that the ancients liked to use. Weren't there countless examples of ancient people using studio names as aliases? For example, Mi Fu had Ba Jin Zhai, Su Shi, in addition to Dongpo Jushi, also had the name Xuetang, and Yuan Mei's fame with Suiyuan was something that even women and children knew, so I decided to work on words like pavilion, platform, building, pavilion, zhai, room, hall, etc. But before I had even obtained a pen name, I already had the feeling of ascending to immortality. I doubted whether I was worthy of being such an "elegant scholar." Just as I was hesitating, I accidentally flipped to a passage in Banqiao's family letters: "In recent times, the titles of poems... such as Mou Xuan, Mou Yuan, Mou Zhai, Mou Lou, Mou Yan, Mou Cun, Mou Qi, are all vulgar and unbearable things from the market place. Today they create an alias, and tomorrow it's on the poem paper. With such titles, one can know their poems! With such poems, one can know their character!" After reading it, I was sweating profusely, so I quickly abandoned all those paths and hurried to find new material.</p>
<p>Heavens, I felt lost, I couldn't help but sigh three times: Only now do I know that a writer can be and cannot be!</p>

<h3>A Gift for the Person in the Song—New Words on Couplets, Seven</h3>
<p>— Tingsong</p>
<p>The enjoyment of embedding characters is mostly for gifting to people in songs, and those that are collected into sentences and widely circulated for a time, such as: "Smaller than a nightingale and lighter than a swallow, clouds remind one of clothes and flowers remind one of a face." Embedding the two characters "Xiao Yun" is well known. If embedding the two characters "Ruyi", then "Everyone says I should return, but I ask you, what do you mean?" It is said that when Xiangxiang was traveling in Hankou, someone advised him to make a plan, so he said this. Embedding the two characters "Dagu", then "Generally, life is like a dream, so just indulge in pleasure here." It is said to be made by Peng Gangzhi, and the language is bold and unrestrained, which is indeed like his person. In the past, there was a talented scholar in Wu, named Xiaolian, or it is said that he was the top scholar of a certain subject. When he first won the autumn examination, he traveled to Hankou. In a song, there were sisters, the older named Mudan, the younger named Shaoyao. The talented scholar was infatuated with the older sister, and forgot to return home. One day, in the midst of wine, he suddenly said: "You two are named after flowers, although elegant, it is actually vulgar. I want to change it to Huajun and Huaxiang, intending to still use the two flowers, but the wording is newer. After the two changed their names, their fame became more sonorous. The talented scholar repeatedly planned to return home, but for a long time could not bear to leave this gentle land. Huajun said to him: "Since you have changed my name, why not make a couplet with embedded characters?" So and so collected Tang poems into a sentence and said: "Flowers can be plucked when they bloom, you ask when I will return." Collecting sentences is not difficult, but the difficulty lies in the suitability of the tone. Huaxiang provoked him and said: "Can you collect another couplet for me?" Someone said: "What is so difficult? The first sentence still uses 'Flowers can be plucked when they bloom', and pair it with 'It is difficult to meet, and difficult to part'." Then it is obtained. This couplet is naturally collected, using the character "Xiang" together, which is more clever than Huajun's couplet borrowing the character "Jun", but it is still not as good as the couplet made by my He Jianchao Taishi, which is even more comprehensive.

<h3>Strange Things in the World</h3>

<p>In Guoli Yecheng, there was a bricklayer named Feng Daili. One day, he accidentally lost his footing and fell from the roof of a six-story building. He fell into an empty baby carriage and did not suffer any damage. As a result: the woman pushing the cart fainted, fell, and sprained an ankle bone.</p>
<h3>On the Failure of Education</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>"Now the people who do evil are all educated people, rickshaw pullers won't be traitors, and corrupt officials and bureaucrats need returned students to make it especially sensational..." Such words can be named "On the Failure of Education."</p>
<p>Those who say these things have not thought that if more than half of the population were not illiterate, those traitors and corrupt officials and bureaucrats would not be able to be so rampant; the common people would not let them be so rampant. They also did not think that many intellectuals sacrificed themselves for righteousness during the enemy-puppet period, and many intellectuals, relying on the little faith that education gave them, still struggled to support themselves and maintained their integrity in the most turbid environment.</p>
<p>They are just like seeing a few great men in history with questionable origins, and thinking that all illegitimate children must be geniuses. Seeing that the people who do evil are educated, they think that education has failed, which is like seeing that horses have four legs, and concluding that all four legs are horses, which is illogical.</p>
<p>Education, education, education is such a powerful nourishment for a nation, I feel indignant when I hear the argument of educational failure.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Peril</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Old Zhong never misses this kind of showy thing!" Someone said.</p>
<p>"If he didn't, how could he be considered a progressive element?" Old Zhong's popularity didn't seem to be very good; several people were discussing him as soon as he left.</p>
<p>"And," the limping man who liked to sigh added, still sorting banknotes with both hands. "His family has already left! Wife, children, nanny, they all took Mr. Zhang's car from Wanguo Pharmacy together the day before yesterday and went to Liuzhou! Alas! At this moment, he and Old Li are going out to get the red plum, that's for sure!"</p>
<p>At least five or six people grunted at the same time, obviously they all thought the limping man's prediction was correct.</p>
<p>"Old Zhong, alas! Full of art, full of struggle, but actually he's just a petty bourgeois!" The limping man happily added a few sentences. "Can he eat our food here? Alas!" He sighed twice every three sentences.</p>
<p>The banknotes on the big table on the left were all sorted out, tied into three long strips. Four young men and a girl stepped back to rest.</p>
<p>"In your eyes, a pessimist, people like Old Zhong are naturally slogan-shouting liars," the girl said in a theatrical manner, "but you can't write it all off, he put in a lot of effort in this flag donation parade, those trucks..."</p>
<p>A seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy took out a harmonica from his pocket and played the March of the Volunteers?</p>
<p>"Trucks! What's so rare about borrowing a few trucks?" Another "anti-Zhong" member chimed in, saying, "He spends all day mixing with those merchants in Guilin who specialize in making war fortunes, how much does it cost them to borrow a few old trucks? Speaking of it, it's still for..."</p>
<p>"Alas!"</p>
<p>"Weren't all those trucks borrowed from Zhongfu Company today?" Someone asked beside the limping man.</p>
<p>"Yes! That's why Xu Shaoming didn't donate any more money when we paraded to the gate of Zhongfu!" the girl explained to him.</p>
<p>"Old Zhu was unhappy because of this; after the parade, he decided to go to Xu Shaoming alone." the limping man told them.</p>
<p>"No wonder Old Zhong is unhappy! Xu Shaoming is his good friend!" three "anti-Zhong" members said loudly.</p>
<p>The limping man's table of banknotes was also counted, and someone went to the curator's office to invite representatives from the Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Municipal Government. Everyone solemnly settled the donations raised today and hid them together in two sacks.</p>
<p>No one discussed Old Zhong and Old Zhu anymore, and the harmonica's March of the Volunteers also stopped.</p>
<p>"Together it is 1,376,592 yuan and 50 cents, plus 18 US dollars." Curator Huanyang, who wore deep myopia glasses, announced solemnly.</p>
<p>A seal jointly signed by representatives of military and political organs and Curator Ouyang was affixed to the mouth of the sack, and then two of the most excited young men dragged it into the curator's office. (Five)</p>
