<h3>彭部長談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕中宣部九日下午四時在勵志社舉行記者招待茶會，歡迎甫由延安視察歸來之中外記者團，彭部長於席間表示慰勞之忱，並答覆記者詢問如次：</p>
<p>問，政府改組之近况如何？請說明其遲緩之原因？</p>
<p>彭答：靑年，民社兩黨參加國府委員會名單，均各已內定，俟主席返京，即可決定發表，國府委員會成立後，即改組行政院，靑年，民社兩黨均已決定參加，民社黨表示可任行政院政務委員二席，靑年黨則表示可担任部及政務委員。</p>
<p>問，聞政府將設一新聞局，隸屬政院，情形如何？</p>
<p>彭答：已經國防最高委員會通過，現正草擬組織法，其原則即將中宣部原有職掌中應歸政府辦理者，劃歸新聞局，國防部之新聞局或將改變名稱。</p>
<p>問，最近軍事情况如何？</p>
<p>彭答：（一）山東地域國軍，已於四月二日收復自古有名之　地泰山，共軍退入新泰，蒙陰山區後，糧食缺乏，甚感窘困，現正向黃河以北之魯北徵收民間食糧，南運新蒙，以濟急需。（二）陝北地域國軍，於四月三日收復延安北方之瓦　堡，同時，寗夏國軍於收復定邊縣後，已到達安邊堡，而甘肅東部之慶陽，合水，亦已於八日收復，陝西西部共軍盤據之地帶，不難於短期內肅淸。（三）冀·魯·豫邊區劉伯誠部一度竄擾河南最北部尖端，最近又被擊退回到河北最南尖端大名，濮陽一帶，總之，關內共軍今後之情景，即分別竄入山東，山西之山區，遭遇交通困難，糧食缺乏，人丁稀少之困難，欲畏期支持，實不可能。</p>
<p>問，對莫洛托夫外長回答馬歇爾國務卿文件之印象如何？</p>
<p>答，關於美軍撤退中國，馬帥言之已詳，余對莫洛托夫外長重申蘇聯不干涉中國內政之政策，甚爲欽佩。中國內政不容外國干涉，本爲中國政府堅定之立塲。關於美國援助中國，余願順便指出者，即美國予中國之援助，乃對於中國合法之政府，而　對於武裝叛亂之不忠份子，援助盟邦政府，應無可非議，若美國援助而係給予中國之叛軍，則決非正當。</p>
<p>中外記者所詢有關外交問題二件，頃經外部歐州司長葉公超答覆如下：</p>
<p>問，請說明接收大連·旅順之詳情。</p>
<p>葉答：上星期三政府發言人已說明中國曾將接收大連及旅順區之計劃送達蘇聯政府，我方現仍在等待蘇聯答復中，在未接覆文以前，本人並無其他消息可吿。</p>
<p>問，中國向日本要求賠償之情形如何？</p>
<p>葉答，中國贊成美國政府所主張，提前拆遝日本國內可充賠償物資之一部份，諸君皆知，中國並未向德。義要求任何賠償，此决中國所得日本之提前償付百分比，當然不得影響將來中國於總淸算時提出之要求。中國甚盼美政府之主張能早日執行，至少可免物資之銷蝕，毀損。至於日本國外資產之處置問題，此事倘不能在和會以前圓滿解決，必須在和會時加以決定。</p>

<h3>英國記者籲請　促進中英邦誼　建議舉行中英長程飛行</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦九日電〕著名英國記者山姆遜氏，去歲會訪問中國，頃在「曼却特斯導報」撰一長文，促英國與其東方盟邦加强日常關係。渠云，中英兩國有如許共同利害，凡足以增進兩國間文化與商業聯繫者，務必爲之。雖英國在目前未能以巨款或大量機器商品相濟，須知此時之一二舉措，在中英關係上較之日後更且體之努力，允有重大影響。英國仍極關懷中國命運，故國會代表團將於今秋赴華。渠建議自倫救至南京作一决長距離飛行，則不僅可藉以向中國示敬，且令英國飛機得以揚名全球。山姆遜氏又對英國文化委員會之工作，備致稱揚，並謂該會各項活動尙須縝密加以擴充。尤要者爲貫輸華人以合乎當地情境之實際智識。關於中國新聞之傳至英國，渠謂最大障碍在電報取費過高，較之自英國發電幾大一倍，應設法使南京方面去除「此有害之絆腳石」。至於兩國商務問題，渠謂茍能就物物交易更加詳盡探索，當可獲益。英國政府鑒於遠東之重要，應在外務部加任一次官，專理遠東事。</p>
<h3>共同施政綱領　簽署方式擬定　兩黨名單未作最後決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕民社黨蔣勻田九日上午七時三十分訪王世杰，張羣，商討共同施政綱領之簽署方式，現尙未作最後決定。大致採用交換信件方式，在國政舉行，日期則俟主席返京後決定。張君勱亦定是時抵京出席。同時兩黨參加府委及政院之名單亦即時提交，國府委會即宣吿組成。該項共同施政綱領即於新組成之國府委會首次會中通過，並訂成法案，以爲今後改糾後之政府施政之惟一準繩。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕民靑兩黨府委人選同經決定。茲悉，其政務委員之人選亦經決定，惟民社黨已決定惟爲政務委員而不參加部會。靑年黨則早經確定，其參加地方政權名單，亦已初步提出，其中有十人將分配至各省任廳長。另有軍人欲參加軍事機關者，聞政府對前者已同意，後者則尙在考慮中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕蔣勻田頃語記者，政府曾願以郵電及衛生兩部分配與民社黨人士，惟蔣氏表示。該黨意見，認爲如爲國家財政節省開支，着想郵電部應仍歸併交部管轄，衛生部亦可仍以衛生署行事，民社黨並無意參加政院部會云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕左舜生於昨晨自京返抵滬，記者詢以在京談判停頓之原因何在？左氏表示：行政院改組及開放地方政權雖均有困難，不如想像之痛快；但就靑年黨而論，均非不能克服者。目前情形，一切須俟主席返京後，方能有所決定。</p>
<h3>民社黨開中常會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨昨開中常會就參加政府事詳加商討，但無結論。伍憲子決定不就國府委昌（後，究由何人補替，亦未商定。據聞張君勱主張參加行政院時，只担任政務委員，不負實際責任；惟此項意見，大受各常委之反對，認爲太不切乎實際，伍憲子已表示不願担任府委，且復主張不參加政府；現由在滬某常委去信，促其來滬一叙，藉資交換意見。又港方代表李大明氏，亦於昨日上午乘機飛赴檀香山。</p>
<h3>塔斯社虛構事實中宣部予以駁復</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕九日晚十一時中宣部發言人發表談話如下：四月七日莫斯科眞理報登載塔斯社電報，綜述美國對中國之車事援助，其內容完全出於虛構。該文　離事實太遠，故余認爲僅須指出數項大謬之點，其餘無足深辯。該文謂日本投降之後，美國曾訓練並裝備四十師「國民黨軍隊　爲中日戰爭中美國訓練裝備中國軍隊之二倍。又訓練裝備五萬　國民黨警察」，美國軍事顧問團建立二十七個軍事學校，美國將靑島港與中國分離」，在各大都市附近建設强大之美國空軍基　，中國並無所謂「國民黨軍隊　或「國民黨警察」固無待言，中國政黨握有私有軍隊者，唯中國共產黨。在抗戰時期，美國協助中國訓練軍隊三十六個師，總數不足四十萬人，其中六個師在印度訓練，完全美國裝備，其餘三十個師，在中國訓練，一部份為美國補備，但大部份武器爲中國所自製。此等部隊之組成均爲反攻日本之用。其中若干師在緬甸等地參加戰鬥，美國軍械均在日本投降前交付。現在因整軍結果，此項軍隊實數已不足卅六師，日本投降後，並無美國新訓練之部隊，亦未增設新軍官學校，更無美國訓練中國警察之事。在靑島，中國政府官員之工作從未受外國之牽制。中國無美國空軍基地。在抗戰期間，有若干機塲爲中美共用，以對日本作戰。日本投降後，美國即迅速從各戰塲撤退，從西部各機塲開始。極少數機塲繼續爲美國飛機所使用，以協助中國之遣俘與接收。在馬帥調處期間及調處工作停止後不少中共人員亦獲美機輸送之便利。抗戰期間，美國在中國之一切措施均根據聯合國之戰略當時及嗣後，美國之行動毫無侵害中國主權之處，眞理報之記載，實對於舉世週知之事實全部加以歪曲。</p>
<h3>銀行法草案　昨初步審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕銀行法草案九日晨由立院作初步審查，張肇元主席。財部戴司長銘禮，經部鄧司長翰良及滬銀錢業代表沈日新，朱旭昌，鄒讓卿，陸書良等列席。沈日新等說明銀錢業界對該法希望，盼營業自由得增加，政府管制能减少，並提出其他意見多項。據起草人張肇元吿記者，初步審查工作十日可完成，財經兩委會十二日將開聯席會，該案可於下决立院例會中提出。</p>
<h3>美對塘沽事件　不採外交步驟</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕美國代理國務卿艾契遜本日在記者招待會中，曾就駐華美陸戰隊被襲事發表談話。略謂，關於此案，美國不擬採取任何外交步驟。艾氏稱：此一襲擊案不能期望中國政府負責，故陸戰隊就地自行採取適當之步驟。</p>
<p>〔路透社天津九日電〕上星期六在新河被共軍襲擊時死亡之美陸戰隊五名，定於今日下午六時在塘沽小敎堂大殮，由隨軍牧師馬丁主持儀式。同時陸戰隊當局不久擬由現在天津醫院治療之此役受傷美軍，招待記者，報吿事件經過。</p>

<h3>延安之戰追記</h3>
<p>— 張洲</p>
<p>在六天之中，向前挺進了二三百公里，克復了數個大城，越過了三四道堅强的防綫，在共軍佔據了十三年的陝甘寗邊區核心站住了脚，而且繼續前進，無論怎麽講，在軍事戰績上看，這成就確不可否認。　共軍在陝甘寗的軍區劃分，共有四處：（一）延屬區（即延安周圍），（二）安邊區（靖邊及鹽池一帶），（三）隴東區（慶陽，寗縣合水之屬），（四）關中區（在馬攔附近）。今年二月，當和平談判日趨黯淡的時候，共軍發動了關中隴東兩區的攻勢，進擾國軍，在合水，慶陽等地，經國軍進駐之後，隴東的攻勢，即吿破碎。馬欄克復之後，關中軍區也完全潰散，在這兩次戰役中，國軍雖有損失，共軍也有很大的傷亡，除民兵之外，警一旅，敎一旅及二旅，也都損失主力，連共軍老幹部（參加長征的部隊）號稱飛馬牌的新四旅，也被國軍打坍了。這兩次戰爭是延安之戰的序幕，到中共「保衛延安」時，這些番號的部隊，因主力喪失，減少戰鬥力，在六天之中而潰敗，這也是原因之一。</p>
<p>「陝甘寗區」的四個軍區當中，只有延屬軍區的防禦工事最堅固，共軍在十幾年來，對延安的防禦工程，從未鬆懈，記者曾參觀　縣境的茶坊附近陣地及勞山，淸凉山各地工事，的確非常堅固，對空軍，陸軍的防禦設備，都是應有皆備，尤其是大小勞山的山頭，多半是有很長的地洞及地下設備，聽說民國廿四年張學良部進剿延安的時候，有兩師人全部在勞山谷中覆沒了。現經過了十數年，當較過去更堅韌，更完備，這是事實。</p>
<p>國軍是在十四日拂曉開始全面進擊，在洛川至宜川之間，分五路前進。當時共軍的計劃，不止是阻止國軍，而且是要把國軍全部消滅於延安外團（被國軍俘來之共軍警一旅副司令員陳國棟語），在共軍對國軍的戰略估計上，犯了大錯誤，他們想國軍要由正面穩紮穩打，所以在正面都有强韌的設備，像延安以南，不但埋下地雷，而且預備堅壁淸野，欲使國軍困死，同時，對共軍的戰鬥力，也是自覺甚强。</p>
<p>三月十四日晨，國軍左　克復了交道十五日經一日之激戰，　拿下了茶坊，就停止進擊，只擁兵在正面。由宜川進擊之國軍，則輕裝　進側擊勞山，並向延安迂迴，這一來，共軍的算盤全吿錯打，到十九日拂曉，國軍第一師一六七旅李錕崗將軍部，就攻克了延安東邊的兩個山頭，當時共軍則在西邊山頭堅守，經國軍空砲配合轟擊四小時之後，共軍不支而退，世界注意的延安，輕輕的被國軍克復。延安市民在砲聲隆隆中，被共軍動員疏散到周圍的山谷中去，只有老幼殘廢的四五十人，留在市內。</p>
<p>甘泉，延長，安塞，也在最短期中，經國軍進駐。而延安市民，在週後也慢慢的回來了，小販小攤也漸次恢復營業，街上過去共軍的標語，被刷沒了，新的換上去，過去的「特區」今天纔又正常。</p>
<p>在延安之戰的戰略上，共軍的估計錯誤非常大，他把今天的國軍戰略，還看作十年以前的「笨法」。在共軍的戰鬥力計算上，也幾乎完全失敗，在共軍遺留於茶坊的文件中，他們希望該地守軍至短可以抵抗至三月二十九日，事實上只抗爭了一天，同樣在右翼的金盆　的陣地，共軍也是預備多年，守軍是特務團，按他們的理想，這至少可作三四日約防衛，事實上也只是打了四五個鐘頭，吃了七八顆砲彈，就溜之大吉。</p>
<p>民衆對共軍，多半是敢怒而不敢言，而共軍的中下級幹部，對國軍優良的武器，也感到懼怕，聽一位朋友說，金盆灣之役，當國軍用砲轟擊之後，共軍士兵不顧「長官一的命令，就潰散下去，經這個插曲可以看見他們的士氣了。在延安我曾訪問了十幾個被國軍俘虜過來的民兵，他們大部份都是携械投誠，都是面黃肌瘦，滿臉風塵，經過八年對日苦戰之後，一般民衆，對戰爭實在頭痛。我問他們爲什麽要打仗，他們多是嚴肅的說：「誰願意，還不是沒法子」。　延安之戰，沒有大規模的主力戰，而是高級的指揮成功，省去了許多生命，雖然這並不是共軍的喪鐘，但在民衆的信仰上，國軍的士氣上，是有着它應有的成就。在茶坊陣地上，就有一個軍官對我說：「共軍沒勁兒，不吃打，我覺得好像還不如他們在江西時候那麽兇」。（四月五日）</p>

<h3>李承晚昨飛抵滬　據談返韓後即進行組織政府　定今晚晋京候謁主席</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕韓國革命領袖李承晚博士，偕秘書張基永，自美乘西北航空公司巨型機來華，八日晨抵東京，當晚繼續西飛，於昨（九日）下午四時廿分抵滬。本市韓僑及各界前往江灣機塲迎接者，有韓國光復軍總司令李靑天將軍，國民外交協會秘長在竹一，教育局長顧毓琇，市府交際科長張彼德，外交部駐滬辦事處高陵白，市黨部書記長謝仁釗，市婦女會王家珍，李洛霞，曁中韓文化協會，韓國僑民協會，朝鮮學典館，韓僑愛國婦女會，韓僑仁成學校等二十團體代表約二一百餘人，情緒至爲熱烈。</p>
<p>李氏年已七十二歲，然精神仍壯健。下機後，即與歡迎者握手寒暄。當由婦女會孔雲卿再卿二姊妹獻花後，李氏隨即向全體僑民致詞，略謂：「僑胞來此歡迎，本人深爲感謝。本人在美曾與美政府商討組織政府之事，業已談妥，此次回國，即將凖備組織政府。僑民在國外生活艱苦，本人極表同情」云云。旋又向仁成學校小學生致訓詞後，逕赴都城飯店四〇一號室休息。</p>
<p>李氏談話</p>
<p>李氏在都城飯店接見記者，發表談話稱：關於組織政府事，已在美與美政府當局商獲結果，並徵得霍奇將軍同意。途經東京，曾與麥帥長談兩小時，對成立韓國臨時政府及韓人治韓兩大原則，麥帥完全同意。此次返國後，即擬着手進行組織政府，一俟韓國立法機構通過選舉法後，即實行普選，成立民選之中央政府，爲時當不致在遠；但目前所擬組織之政府，僅限於朝鮮南部，蓋北部現由蘇軍管制，吾等原所布望組織之政府，乃包括南北全部，但霍奇將軍之意，爲避免與蘇聯引起誤會起見，暫將北部擱置。吾人希望於南部成立政府之後，能直接與蘇聯協議，撤退蘇軍，完成南北一統之政府。</p>
<p>李氏又稱：渠在美時，曾得杜魯門總統之同意，在韓國政府成立以後，以六億元之美金貸與韓政府，以作善後及經濟上之協助。此案將於美國對希臘及土耳其之貸款在國會通過後提出。</p>
<p>來華任務</p>
<p>記者詢及李氏來華之任務，據渠吿稱：此來並無任何秘密任務，僅擬拜謁蔣主席，俾兩國能獲更深之瞭解，而增進邦交。韓國人民對於蔣主席成感激萬分，尤以蔣主席對韓臨時政府之協助，表示誠摯之謝忱。中韓兩國之合作，對於遠東和平，實有極大之帮助。余對於蔣主席應付共黨問題，深爲同情，蓋韓國目前所處情形，實與中國相同。</p>
<p>李氏又表示：目前計劇在組織政府後所擬實施之國策，第一爲與蘇聯取得合作與諒解，此外如要開放韓幣匯兌，樹立外交，經濟地位等，均所必需。</p>

<h3>接收旅大重要關鍵　擊於解決非法軍隊　蘇方有無誠意可以此爲新</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽九日電〕關于接收旅大重要關鍵，據悉仍在蘇軍警戒綫內之共軍及偽政權解散問題。據關係機關稱：此項非法武裝部隊及僞政權，應由蘇軍繳械或遣散，否則國軍必須自行擊滅，始可談及接收行政問題，因我方鑒於過去長春，哈爾濱，齊齊哈爾之接收，生命無保障，行動失自由，如張莘夫遭殘殺，松北接收人員被迫由蘇境撤回上海等，殊無再蹈覆轍之必要。由於蘇方之能否照我希望辦理，可測蘇方有無交還旅大誠意。</p>
<p>〔又電〕爲求完善接收旅大而設之自治幹部人員訓練班，七日開課後，正積極訓練，定廿日結業，受訓幹部的一百六十人，均係作地方工作之區保長人員。又行轅所辦之旅大接收人員講習會，定十四日開始，廿日可畢事，參加講習者多爲較高級接收人員。</p>

<p>又關於我國赴美人民根據美移民律規定：（一）凡持普通護照向美領事以遊歷簽證赴美者，照例祇能留居一年並不得受僱担任任何工作：（二）凡以學生簽證赴美求學者，亦不得兼受僱用，希我國赴美人民注意此項規定云。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>韓國必須獲得獨立　——歡迎李承晚博士來華</h3>
<p>韓國革命領袖李承晚博士，日昨由美飛抵滬上。此間中韓文化協會與國民外交協會，曁黨政教育各界團體，已準備盛大的歡迎，以慰李博士旅途之勞，並藉以加强中韓關係的聯繫。中國和韓國情同手足，李博士此番遠道而來，不辭跋涉之勞，我們衷誠表示歡迎；並願博士在華旅居的康泰！</p>
<p>韓國又稱朝鮮，爲突出亞洲大陸東南的一大半島，地勢南北長，並處中蘇日三國之間：東濱日本海，西臨黃海，南隔朝鮮海峽和日本九州及中國地方相望，北以鴨綠江圖們江和中國東北及蘇聯沿海州交界。它在國勢上，爲亞洲大陸和日本列島的「陸橋」，而在政治經濟與文化上，則與中國關係最爲密切。立國以來，韓族先後遭受蒙古人滿洲人以及日本人的園困與蹂躪，而韓族仍不斷奮鬥，爭取獨立自由。一八九四年至一八九五年第一次中日戰爭，一九〇四年至一九〇五年日俄戰爭，雖予半島以獨立，一自此日本勢力日有增加；有一短時期爲日本保護國，到一九一〇年便正式併入日本版圖。韓族不欲受日本統治，曾多次起義，其最著者爲一九一九年三月一日的「萬歲大暴動」，亦稱「三一革命」，爲亞洲弱小民族最壯烈的一次革命運動。在這次運動中，李承晚博士曾作堅苦的領導，當革命運動開展，李博士受全韓人民的擁護，榮任韓國臨時政府第一任大總統，功勛卓著。「三一革命」失敗后，李博士流亡海外，繼續領導獨立運動，廿餘年如一日，其精神實至令人可佩！其抱負也令人可敬！此次李博士訪問中國，不僅足以增進中韓關係，及中國廣大人民對韓國的認識，並必能有裨益於今日韓國環境的改變，爲韓國的自由獨立爭取它所應得的地位。</p>
<p>韓國必須獨立，韓族必須自由，這是韓國人民的呼聲，這也是中國人民的呼聲，並且成爲參加泛亞洲會議谷民族的呼聲。韓族在人種上自成一族，民族生活地理上不能分割，民族精神堅不挫，爲現在和未來的亞洲世紀，最有希望最有前程的一個民族。但韓國必須獨立，必須自由。當一九四三年中英美三國領袖會議於開羅的時候，曾明白宣佈共同壓迫日本無條件投降，並儘量援助韓國實現獨立自由。這一宣言，對於韓國流亡海外的革命領袖，特別是重慶的韓國臨時政府，及英美谷國的韓僑，發生了絕大的刺激作用，他們因革命前途有了光輝而興奮，因而更加奮力於協助反抗日本侵略的事業，以答報聯合國對他們崇高的友愛。可惜一九四五年日本投降，聯合國獲得勝利，韓國的獨立仍可望而不可及，美蘇關係交錯於韓國間題，而韓族環境的悲哀，何等令人同情！因之，韓國必須獨立自由的呼聲；發出在亞洲每一個角落。</p>
<p>今日韓國的環境是這樣的：當日本宣佈無條件投降前夕，蘇聯對日宣戰，紅軍迅速指向中國東北和韓國北部；接着日本投降，美軍佔領韓國漢城，是年九月十日，美佔領軍成立軍政府於韓城。斯時起，韓國無形分裂成兩部，美蘇兩軍分據半島南北，而以北緯三十八度爲界。蘇軍所占地區，包括咸鏡北道，咸鏡南道，平安北道，平安南道，黃海道（除南部極小部分）及江原道的北半部，共的四八，四八七方哩，佔全韓面積五六·九％，人口的八·三一四千人，佔全韓人口三六·五％；美軍所占地區，包括全羅南道，全羅北道，慶尙南道，慶尙北道，忠淸南道，忠淸北道，京畿道，江原道的南半部和黃海道南部極小部份，共約三六·七六一方哩，占全韓而積四三·一％，人口一四·四八五千人，占全韓人口六三五％。以言輕濟價値，美軍占領區較重大；以言戰略價値，蘇軍占領區較爲重要。美蘇在韓國問題上的錯綜矛盾，是韓國的不幸，是遠東和平前途的不幸，但不幸的事實變演，却於是年十二月莫斯科美英蘇三外長會議，把它合法化了。三國公佈有關韓國問題的協議，規定中美英蘇四國共同託管韓國五年。於此託管期內，劃分韓國爲美蘇兩個管轄區。很顯明的，協議的成立，似有背於民族自主的精神，分裂了韓國的統一，延宕了韓國的獨立，加深了美蘇關係的矛盾，並且給予中國的東北以重大的威脅。無論就開羅會議宣言精神說，聯合國憲章精神說，甚至遠東和平的前途說，韓國的獨立是必然的，韓族的自由是必然的，所謂共同管轄，所謂共同託治，它不能爲韓國和遠東，帶來了安定與和平，它祗能加重韓國和遠東的紛亂與危機。韓國臨時政府主席金九，於離渝返國時曾宣言：「韓國決不能分裂爲二，深信聯合國完成彼等之使命後，將此政權交還自由之韓人，南北國民必須團結而使祖國復見强榮。」這是何等意味深長。</p>
<p>我們中國是以援助弱小民族獨立自由爲職志，對韓國今日的處境是同情的，輿諭對託治韓國是反對的，並且對韓國南北國民的團結，及韓國早日獲得獨立自由，一貫寄予莫大的希望。在泛亞洲會議席上，我們看見有韓國代表裴克呼籲盟國實踐諾言，韓國必須從速實現獨立：如今在野的韓國革命領袖李承晚博士，又前來訪問中國，我們除了熟烈歡迎李博士外，並希望韓國國民團結努力，在李承晚博士和其它革命領袖的領導下，共同奮鬥，俾眞正代表韓國人民意志的統一，政府能够得以早日成立，恢復强榮。</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫突同意討論　德未來疆界問題　外長會議似已稍有轉機　衆信此係英美相繼提出警告結果</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科九日廣播：四外長今開會將討論兩大問題：（一）德波邊界之部分，（二）魯爾與萊茵處理辦法。關於第一項問題，馬歇爾將建議成立一特別委員會，就地研討德波邊境整個問題。至於第二問題，馬卿將提議由聯合國予以處理。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科九日電〕四國外長會議今日將辯論戰敗德國之將來邊疆，預料美國將要求修改波蘭西陲，以一部份土地歸還德國，聞美國已擬就德州國邊疆方案，將魯爾區交德國保留，上西萊西亞區歸波蘭，並許歐洲其他國家參加管理該兩區極重要經濟資源。蘇聯圳將反對。此外，四外長對於法國要求魯爾與萊茵工業區，亦將發生爭執。西方外交官稱，今日會議，當可明白顯示蘇聯外長莫洛托夫是否凝與美國務卿馬歇爾及英外長貝文共同努力，加速會議工作。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科八日電〕蘇聯堅持反對討論對德和的之基本問題一事，今已因美國務卿馬歇爾與英外相貝文相繼警吿莫洛托夫，謂將危害會議之進展後，已獲轉機。馬歇爾在今日四强會議席上要求着手進行建議性之工作，勿再互相爭執，略謂：倘吾人繼續爭議不決，意見不能趨於一致，則此次會議恐將一無成就可言，貝文則譴責莫洛托夫之拒不討論基本問題，乃在故意阻撓會議之進展。至此莫洛托夫突然表示讓步，四强遂同意於明日討論德國之將來疆界，魯爾與萊茵區等問題，並定於十日討論起草和的之程序問題，十一日聽取調整委員會關於各項爭端之報吿書，莫洛托夫並亦同意再派一新代表參加調整委員會或外次會議，進行對德和約工作。蓋蘇聯現僅有代表一人，即外决維辛斯基，出席調整委會與外次會議，以致兩會未能同時進行，影響工作之進行。莫洛托夫今日在會議應席上先曾怒斥英美兩國對賠償問題拒不履行波茨協定，並對盟國賠償委員會之遷延工作，表示不滿。貝文當即加以答覆稱：此因未能獲得蘇聯方面之情報所致，且蘇聯亦未根據波茨坦協定，對西方國家履行其義務，今日會議直至結束時，莫洛托夫經貝文與馬歇爾之警吿後，始同意定期聽取調整委員會之報吿書，進行討論對德和約各項基本問題。</p>
<p>會議或將延長十日</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科八日電〕莫洛托夫於今日會議結束之際，討論下次議程時，建議於九日下午五或六時集會，俾調整委會有時間準備其報吿。貝文抗議何故不討論議程中之第三點，渠稱，此種方式，對待吾人實欠公平。馬歇爾亦堅持依照議程行事，渠稱，彼等不應繼續「對歧見作內部討論」，吾人母寗澄淸大局氣氛，以爲下屆外長會議準備較好基礎。馬卿之提及下屆外長會議，係表示英美人士，不滿本屆外長會議，英美人士對本屆會議能否獲致若千協議，實甚懷疑，彼等甚且懷疑能否於蘇京草成對奧和的。據悉，木屆會議或將延長若干時日，英美代表於數遍前，已分別訂購十三日及十五日之返國飛機票，刻會議似將延長十日。</p>
<h3>外長代表完成　對奧和約草案</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科八日合衆電〕四外長代表今雖已完成對奧和約工作，然美代表克拉克謂獲致最後協議之瞻望，「不甚光明」。蘇對奧國問題，毫不讓步，對奧和約草案，已交外長會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科八日電〕四國外長代表己於今日完成奧國和約草案條文之檢討工作，然並未能在其報吿書內，增加業已同意之條文。該報吿書己於三月廿九日向外長會議一提出，顯示在奧和的全部五十五條中，己經四國同意者僅有二十四條。</p>
<h3>英蘇修約談判　進展尚稱順利</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科八日電〕關於英蘇兩國進行修改盟約之談判，頃據此間英國人士談稱，雖因四國外長會議而不得不暫緩進行，但在實際上已獲良好進展，英條雙方業已在數日前互相交換其所擬就之草的，本日英國駐蘇聯大使裴特遜爵士與哈爾佛，又將與蘇聯外次維辛斯基會晤。自外長會議開幕以來，英蘇兩國代表會晤，此爲第三次，一俟雙方就草的交換意見之後，即可望討論與盟約有關之一切問題云。</p>
<h3>英外相歡宴　美蘇法外長</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科八日電〕英國外相貝文本日在英國大使館設宴款待美法蘇三國外長，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥，法國外長比杜爾夫婦曁蘇聯外次維辛斯基，均曾參加。</p>
<h3>貝文外交政策　可獲工黨支援</h3>
<p>傳英閣有改組醞釀</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦儿日電〕此問權威方面預料工黨於復活節後之第四十天舉行全國大會時，可望批准貝文外相之外交政策，內閣閣員近會不時召開外交政策之辯論會，會中情况顯示工黨領袖多亦擁護，且下院工黨議員三百名中，有百分之七十五均擁護貝文及內閣。關係方面相信工黨全國大會中所最令人注意之兩問題，當爲英美蘇之關係，及英國在國外之駐軍及國防所需之人力問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕此間今日盛傳英閣有改組之說，謂英相艾德禮刻正在考慮由外相貝文負責處理政府設計工作，以征服經濟危機。據素對工黨政府表示好感之「星報」稱：首相艾德禮在消度復活節假期時，即在考慮改組內閣）本，但調動範圍須視莫立遜之健康情形而定。蓋莫氏不但為工黨首領，旦亦為下院政府派領袖奧經濟設計大臣，今則因病而在法療養。</p>
<h3>范登堡力促參院　通過援助希土案　演詞中間接駁覆蘇方指責</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕共和黨參議員范登堡於參院開始辯論杜魯門之援助希土案時致辭，要求蘇聯同意「生存及任共生存」之原則，以解決美蘇關係中之問題。范登堡否認建議中之援助，爲可與門羅主義相比的新主義。渠並力促爲未雨綢繆，防患未然計，通過杜魯門之計劃。</p>
<p>渠云：：「本案所牽涉之問題，類似我國和平過程中，以及東方共產主義與西方民主主義經常摩擦中之問題。從此一問題，不斷產生蘇聯及其附庸國與美國及共他非共產國家間之種種困難。此外更顯著的牽涉仇視共產擴張及滲入之現象。而同時在另一方面，吾人亦常聞蘇聯恐懼其鄰邦再事侵略之言。若莫斯科確有此種恐懼，渠自應除去之。</p>
<p>各國應有自主之權</p>
<p>吾人力主美國及他國之應有自主之權，同時亦相信蘇聯應有自主之權，若能互相尊重，即可消減此種恐懼。范登堡繼謂：「吾人有權要求蘇聯證明並無以共產世界包圍吾人之意，停止在我國內及國外之共產黨攻勢，恪遵擁護大西洋憲章及聯合國憲章之諾言。余所要求者，不僅為言辭上之表示，且為事實上之表示，目前最大之需要，為由吾人兩國從事坦白討論，如屬可能，應將牌攤明草上」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕參議院外交委員會主席范登堡今日在參院發表演說，答復蘇聯代表葛羅米柯昨日在聯合國安全理事會對美國之指責，要求參院通過軍事與財政上援助希臘土耳其兩國，以免發生連續反響，危及全世界之和平與安全。</p>
<p>援助希土　事屬必要</p>
<p>演說中雖未提及葛羅米柯名字，但稱「四億美元援助計劃決非「不顧」聯合國機構，實乃對聯合國機構自願効忠且完全守信之最偉大舉動。由余觀之，若給予聯合國機構以共所無意或不準備担任之特殊事務，適足以害之。吾人不應忽視其聯業，但亦不應委以分外聯業因而破壞其效能。在目前情形之下，希臘將淪入共產主義勢力圈內，東西雙方均將發生連續之致命反響。聯合國機構目前所以不能處理希土問題之理由有二，一則聯合國機構無論過去現在均無意成爲一救濟機構，二則聯合國機構並無兵力爲後盾。後者蓋因蘇聯代表迄今不允此項計劃實現所致。若佯謂援助希土方案執行後，即可一勞永逸，其他援助可吿結束，此則無異自欺欺人。美國在朝鮮之占領責任無疑即須積極支爰。吾人必須認淸事實，如若不然，或將引起其他局勢，一任陰影伸長，顯將株連吾人自身之國家幸福」。</p>
<h3>勞資雙方談判十五小時　美電話工潮好轉　一二日內即有復工可能</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播：美電話工人與資方連續談判十五小時，已大有進步，一二日內即可復工。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕美政府調人企圖爲停止全國電話工潮，故於八日晚促使資方及工會代表進行討價還價會議。但罷工工人代表九日晨稱：早日解決工潮糾紛之希望甚少。惟聯邦調解主任華倫九日晨稱：解決工潮之努力甚為順利。長途電話工人二萬餘人乃係罷工中之中堅份子。據悉：各大城市中自動電話工人之工作能否持久，頗不能確定。工會方而稱：若工潮再延長，則該部工人日內即將停工。但勞工部官員則稱：自動電話工人大致可繼續工作。</p>
<h3>參院外委會通過　駐印暹大使人選</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕參院外委會本日一致通過任命葛雷第爲駐印大使，史丹頓爲駐暹大使案。</p>
<h3>伊朗機場兩處　位于該國北部裏海沿岸</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社德黑蘭八日電〕官方頃宣佈伊朗政府刻在裏海沿岸賴姆薩與巴波爾薩兩處建造飛機塲，可望於一個月內，即可使用云。</p>
<h3>國際貿易機構　籌備會議揭幕　美盼能獲致互惠貿易協議</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕由十八國家組成之聯十合國國際貿易機構籌備委員會，將於四月十日在日內瓦召開會議。代理國務卿艾契遜木日表明對該會之信心，稱「此項會議將爲世界貿易與經濟繁榮之轉捩點，使世界更趨接近於吾人所日夕企禱之持久和平。」艾氏在記者招待會上提及美方代表團團長經濟司司長克萊頓，已首途赴日內瓦。克氏希望日內瓦籌備委會能如期完成對世界貿易機構憲章之討論，俾將討論結果提交秋季召開之世界貿易就業大會。渠亦指出日內瓦會議之另一目的爲獲致互惠貿易協議，以减除世界貿易之障碍。</p>
<h3>蘇聯反對　調查團常駐希臘</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社日內瓦九日電〕聯合國巴爾幹調查委員會新聞秘書里安昨日向報界談稱：本會擬以半常設性質之機關留在希臘一項計劃，今已爲蘇聯之反對而予推翻。據悉：該委會現有依從希臘政府某種要求之象徵。</p>
<h3>傳英美已成立協定　英軍事團繼續留希　以待希政府討伐工作結束</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕權威方面息：英美已於昨日成立協定，規定在希臘政府軍剿除遊擊隊之軍事行動結束以前，英國之陸海空軍使命團當繼續留於希臘。留駐確期雖尙在英美雙方之繼續討論中，但料留駐期間或許將較剿除遊擊隊工作之結束爲更長。留駐之目的，在協助負責執行杜魯門援助計劃之美國軍事及經濟使命團，使其熟稔希臘之局勢。英使命團留希期之決定延長，乃杜魯門援助計劃之立法手續遲遲未曾完成之結果。一般相信希臘政府計劃於今年夏季完成剿除遊擊隊及恢復秩序之工作。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕據悉，英國駐希軍隊，已積極减少至兩旅的六千人。</p>
<h3>希臘政府軍　向游擊隊總攻</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典九日電〕據官方宣布：希臘政府軍己於今日上午五時在西馬奇頓省與濟薩隆尼古省向游擊隊發動攻勢，陸海空軍傘兵及警察皆參預其事。</p>
<h3>希臘艦隊　登陸演習</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雅典八日電〕希臘艦隊今日開始在伏洛斯灣舉行登陸演習，以準備與陸軍聯合對遊擊隊作戰。美國駐希海軍武官施奈凱恩堡海軍上將應希錯海軍部長凡尼齊洛斯之邀，亦同往參觀。</p>
<h3>土將發表白皮書</h3>
<p>申述戰時對聯合國貢獻</p>
<p>〔合衆社安哥拉九日電〕由於蘇聯最近攻擊土耳其之結果，謂其未參加第二次世界大戰，此事將使土耳其發表一白皮書，辯護土國戰時外交政策之有用，及其對聯合國之立塲有貢獻。白皮書之內容如何，當無由獲悉，因官方在公佈前，拒絕透露。</p>
<h3>華萊士暢論　美蘇關係</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：華萊士今在此發表重要談話，略謂「下一次世界大戰將使世界損失萬萬億元，祗有遍及世界之「超級新政」，始可挽回此種浩刦。美蘇兩國現可比諸摔角家二人，在未作正式交綏前，彼此先行試探。美蘇兩國同時亦可比諸兇犬二頭，在未互相搏鬥前，先行以鼻試探。世界大戰之是否再度來臨，未來三個月中可見分曉。在兩巨人搏鬥，西歐首當其衝、目前英美蘇三國均在進行其帝國主義之擴展政策，勢必引起戰爭，除非美蘇獲得諒解。但美國若不中止製造原子彈，則絕無獲得蘇聯諒解之可能。</p>
<h3>美飛機工業　生產能力不足</h3>
<p>或由於共黨作累崇所致</p>
<p>〔聯合社坎薩斯州惠契泰九日電〕波音飛機公司惠契泰分廠總經理沙佛今日發表聲明稱，美國飛機工業之生產能力，現感不足，可能因政府中之共產黨勢力作崇所致。此種勢力，杜魯門總統現已決心剷除。當初惠契泰波音飛機廠設計建造，曾耗四千八百萬美元，其製造B—二九型超空堡壘機之設備，己於一九四五年移日本投降後數星期內，奉政府命令，加以摧毀，美國如果保持此等設備，則刻在莫斯科折衝之地位，堅強多矣。</p>
<h3>美煤礦工潮　魯易斯轉趨妥協</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓八日電〕美礦工聯合會主席魯易斯本日致函各地分會主席，內稱：自政府派員檢查各地煤礦之後，若干煤礦己因檢查官員宣布爲安全而復工，各該煤礦復工後產量頗鉅，本人對此深感欣慰；其他煤礦，一俟政府檢查官員證明其情形與安全條例相符之後，亦應恢復生產。此問人士咸認爲魯易斯此函，乃欲對於外界指斥礦工違及政府於去年十一月之禁令而停止工作一節，事先加以駁斥。聯邦法庭定明日審理礦工聯合會案件，俾確定該會是否遵守政府之命令。法官哥斯保羅之判決若有利於礦工聯合會，則該會當可在其以前被科之罰銀三百五十萬美元之中收回二百八十萬美元。</p>
<h3>丹麥國王　因病休養</h3>
<p>太子費勒特力攝政</p>
<p>〔聯合社丹麥京城八日電〕丹麥國王克里斯興十世六日心臟病發，王室方而今日已內定太子費勒特力攝政。國王現年七十六歲，太子四十八歲。</p>
<h3>賴加第亞榮譽</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕前紐約市長與聯總署長賴加第亞，因「對美國與國際公共服務，均有卓越成績」，今日榮膺一九四七年天下一家報紙與播音獎金。諾貝爾紀念委員會附設天下一家委員會特別褒揚賴氏「在電台，報紙及一般公共生活中，不屈不畏，鼓吹「下天一家」之崇高理想」。</p>
<h3>最後消息</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科九日廣播：四外長會開會，首先討論各外决關於各小國對德和的之意見，旋由貝文任主席，討論德邊界問題，聞有相當進展。至於德中央政權與地方政權關係問題，各外長有激烈之辯論，馬歇爾謂一切無謂爭論，應即中止，而從事討論議程其他各項。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：華萊士今在英向報界發表談話，主張美國以貸款擾與蘇聯，並反對美國以借款貸諸希土兩國。</p>
<h3>聞葛羅米柯同意　嚴格管制原子能　各代表追究蘇方案眞義</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖八日電〕今日據可靠消息，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯業已在聯合國原子能委員工作小組秘密會議中聲明，願意接受對原子作嚴格之監察與管制，自礦石階段起以迄最後步驟核子燃料爲止。因之，去年十二月原子能委員會其他十國所核准之報告書，蘇聯今始接受。工作小組決定下星期一繼續詳細審查蘇聯管制原子方案，其要點有二：（一）立即訂立公約，禁止使用原子彈，並規定毀滅現存原子彈。（二）簽訂另一公約，以樹立國際管制制度，且在安全理事會範圍內處理之。</p>
<p>葛氏方案與去年六月美國巴魯克提議且經十國批准之原子管制方案逈不相同，將全部原子條例歸諸管制機構，在五大國有否決權之安全理事會監視下行使職務。美國方案則主張設立國際原子發展機關，全權處理各地原子，對違的者迅予懲罰，五大國對原子事件，不得行使否決權。聞葛羅米柯曾吿各代表謂蘇聯主張由各黨派無保留實施嚴格監督與有效管制。至於原子能委員會第一次報吿書中建議此種監督包括領空飛行在內，則表拒絕。渠堅持管制原子機關可自各國政府獲得工廠名簿。各代表針對葛氏連珠發出種種問題，追究蘇聯方案之確實意義。據某消息靈通人士稱，美國副代表奧斯滂曾質詢葛氏不經調查何能得悉現有若干原子工廠。渠對葛氏答復感覺不滿。最後葛氏聲稱此一問題與當前討論者並無眞正關聯，轉叩奧氏美國是否反對蘇聯提案。爭辯至此，遂吿結束，聞奧氏準備來日繼續質問。</p>

<h3>市區一夜三處大火　茂昌棧烈焰未熄　棧貨損失近千億　出動消防員二百名七名受傷　吳市長兪代局長均親臨查勘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨零時二十分南潯路茂昌堆棧突起空前大火以後，在半夜之內，本市竟接連又發生火災兩起。除茂昌堆棧火勢最熾烈，延燒迄今，巳逾二十四小時，損失近千億外，其餘兩起，一在陽朔路，一在黃河路，損失俱極重大。新開河陽朔路A字五十二號於昨晨三時半起火後，火首全家六口悉數葬身火窟。黃河路三二七弄八號火警，損失亦極大。</p>
<p>南潯路茂昌公司堆棧之大火，昨晨經四小時之延燒後，即自二層穿至三層，並在晨四時，火舌冒出堅韌之鉛皮屋頂。同時堆棧沿靑浦路部份，亦相繼捲入火海，再加風助火威，益不可收拾。五時卅分許，整個鉗皮屋頂焚毁傾坍，剎時烈燄騰空，雖遠至數里外之浦東各地，均能淸晰望見。在塲消防人員爲防止火勢延及鄰近民房，（尤以西首大名路一帶市房僅祗一弄之隔），無不傾全力灌救。至八時許，虹口區消防警任樹恒因避讓飛舞之鐵片，不愼失足，由附近屋頂墜下，跌傷頭部甚重。至九時又有王逢炳，王守信及中央消防警王鈞銓，陶熾，唐錫淸，王友順等六人，相繼被水泥瓦磚倒下，壓傷頭胸手足各部。其餘消防人員雖處於此種難從情形下，然仍能堅守本位，鄰近數十幢市房，得吿無恙。　　火勢於十時後始趨和緩，惟被壓於鉛皮屋頂下之大批棉花，電信局之電器材料，以及北部「聯總」「行總」存儲之剩餘物資及西藥，茂昌公司自有即將運赴國外之鮮蛋蛋黃等，至昨日深夜，猶延燒不止。</p>
<p>當昨晨火熾時，附近住戶，深恐殃及，紛紛將重要衣物搬至大名路西首人行道上過宿，虹口警分局派大批警士自晨起直至午後四時，將該處附近四週予以斷絕交通，以資保護，故昨日七，八，十路各英商有軌電車均停駛，四時後交通始恢復，惟行人仍禁止通過。</p>
<p>吳市長及兪代局長極表關切，在昨日火熾時均親臨火塲查勘，至六時後始離去。兪代局長並於午後五時再度蒞臨火塲，指示一切，對此次茂昌堆棧大火，以及昨晨同時發生之另外二處火警，表示驚異，稱係接收警局以來，從未曾有。</p>
<p>據消防處長周兆祥稱：茂昌之火，如無意外發生，可望於今日全部撲滅。消防處此次出動之消防人員達二百名以上，出動救火車，照明車等近廿輛。美軍消防隊及港口消防隊聞訊，亦均先後自動到塲協助灌救。</p>
<p>茂昌公司堆棧大火一晝夜未熄而消防員奮勇灌救致附近街道已積水成渠（本報攝）</p>
<h3>堆棧有關人員　九人扣押</h3>
<p>虹口警局昨已將茂昌公司副經理江輔亨，儲運室主任王承德，及南潯路堆棧底層負責人楊世昇，二層負責人盛家棟，電訊局職員宋春泉，更夫江永堯，鄭華忠，司　捕俄人潘特希阿夫，福來去夫等九名，予以扣押偵查。</p>
<p>該處堆棧第一層係由交通部電信局，鴻運航運局，蘇商友寗公司等三家租用，第二層西北部沿南潯路爲交通部電信局及美利洋行倉庫，東部堆置者全爲「聯總」自冲繩島運來之七百餘大箱剩餘物資，及「行總」之西藥。三層除小部份爲維火洋行堆置什物外，餘悉爲茂昌公司之冷氣設備，及即將啓遝赴國外之鷄蛋及蛋黃。初步損失估計，（底層除外），茂昌公司冷氣設備爲二百五十億元，電信局約七十餘億（一說約二百五十億）至「聯總」「行總」損失數字，當在五百餘億左右，故此次大火損失，堪稱近數十年來空前未有之巨災。</p>

<h3>怎樣實施「修學旅行」　這是值得提倡與施行的一種敎學活動</h3>
<p>— 馬靜軒</p>
<p>春天到了。春天是修學旅行的時節，各學校教師，照例要率領着學生，到校外去遊覽公園，寺院，山林，田圃，以及名勝之區，藉以擴充學生的見聞，增進學生的知識。所以修學旅行，又呌校外教學。</p>
<p>最近碰到各學校同仁，常談起修學旅行的實施情形。下面是一個具體的計劃，可供各校實施時的參考。</p>
<p>怎樣實施修學旅行？我以爲先要依照學生年齡，決定旅行地點。假如地點較遠，對於年幼學生，是不相宜的。其次要依學生家庭經濟狀况，決定旅行費用，假如需要鉅額旅費，一部分家境淸寒的學生，便無力參加。</p>
<p>地點決定了，費用也很少，全班學生可以參加了，就要進一步擬訂修學旅行的計劃，例如事前應該怎樣準備？出發時應該注意什麽？回校以後應該要做什麼事？然後再逐一指導學生實踐。</p>
<p>（甲）事前的準備，在一决修學旅行未出發之前，要有下列的準備：（一）應備的東西：個人方面——舖蓋（每二人合一件），絨線衫，淸潔用具，雨具，鉛筆，筆記簿，小刀，校徽，另用錢等，團體方面——地圖，校片，校旗，號笛，點名單，救急藥品，採集箱，賬簿，旅費等。（二）應有的組織：全隊設總隊長一人，管理點名，維持風紀，各小隊各設小隊長一人，管理各該小隊遊覽時的秩序，另設急救，會計，事務等幹事，擔任全隊應做的工作。（三）應知的事項：要知道往返的途徑，要知道目的地大槪情形，要知道舟車宿所飯食等手續和預算。</p>
<p>（乙）出發時應注意下列各事項：（一）最好着短服，佩校徽。（二）下列規則，應一律遵守：（1）列隊步行時靠右走，留心前進，立定等號笛，（2）在舟車中勿臨危險的地方，要服務領隊人的號令，（3）遊覽時，勿走出指定區域以外，勿作危險舉動，留心集合號笛和地點，（4）在宿所內，未經教師許可，不得擅自離開，勿爭先喝茶，勿買雜食。（三）要沿途記錄所經歷的情形，隨時採集動植礦物標本，並妥爲保存，一天遊覽完畢，要寫一封信報吿家長，並整理筆記。</p>
<p>（丙）回校以後，要用報吿問答討論作文，繪畫，製作等方法，糾正學生觀察的錯誤或補充觀察的不足。（一）在紀念週由代表報吿旅行的經過。（二）在校刊上或日報上發表旅行記或遊記。（三）在勞美課畫好風景畫，做好採集品，定期舉行修學旅行成績展覽會。（四）討論此次旅行的優點和缺點，（五）結算此次個人和團體的費用。</p>
<p>修學旅行，可以使學生學習艱難，忍耐窮乏，培養互助的道德，促進自治的精神，並可增厚師生間的情感與同學的友誼，尤其在抗戰勝利之後，各地自力建設的發展，更可鼓勵學生努力求學，往前進取，向外雄飛的壯志。這是値得提倡與施行的一種敎學活動，希望學校同仁，勿放棄這個機會。</p>

<h3>滬星乒乓球隊南征記　九戰七勝二負成績美滿</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州航訊〕上海滬星征美乒乓球隊，於去月十八日抵香港，二十日開始接觸，澳穗球迷，多赴港一覩該隊球術爲快，是以情况熟烈，轟動一時，慕名而至者，極爲擁擠。</p>
<p>在澳門</p>
<p>廿四日滬隊率師犯澳，穗港兩隊球迷，咸趨澳門，蓋澳門乒乓球術，歷决駕乎穗港之上。廿五日滬隊首與南中隊比賽，南中隊球員，得陶英隊健將助陣，實力雄厚，計有梁文煥·胡錦英·羅錦燊·林金源·梁煥棠·攻守均宜之健將，雙方演出，精彩鏡頭不少，觀衆嘆爲觀止。惟南中隊積分至十分時不再上升，滬隊一氣呵成，以十三比十獲勝。廿六日滬隊鬥華南，華南與南中，技術不相伯仲，王錫添。陸那烏·黃永年·黃永安　·馬漢榮，更攻守均臻上乘，滬隊賽來，極爲吃力，演出較南中更爲奇趣，結果十三比九，滬隊連挫兩雄師。廿七日澳聯點將鬥滬星，澳門總督，親到觀戰，澳聯盡選擅長攻守之輩上陣，由晚間七時起，展開大戰，滬星不敢怠慢，每局及每分間，不知費幾許時間，方能結束一局，滬星之猛攻，每分非四十拍以上，不能解決一分之勝負，間或滬星攻勢稍弱，澳隊則施反攻，其彈球或抽球，敏捷而力勁，常使滬星招架乏術，漢聯隊之番將陸那烏，素負砲子球之譽，演出極佳，全隊最活潑者首推「小覇王」王錫添，其削球之籙健，居懲港澳之冠，其殺板及縮球，三埠中難出其右，其餘胡錦英之反抽及彈球，削球，羅錦燊·馬漢榮之攻守，皆予滬隊最大打擊，雙方戰至夜半二時，仍局數為十二比十二，最後滬星黃志鈞與澳聯馬漢榮決賽，馬漢榮一鼓作氣，連下數城，以廿一比十五而敗黃志鈞，雙方賽罷，疲態畢露，皆不能興云。</p>
<p>在廣州</p>
<p>廿九日滬星隊赴廣州比賽，廣州自復員後，乒乓領導，仍未得人，故興趣不高，各將從未練習，是日首戰普育隊，普育雖擁有前譽滿香港之單人冠軍梁焯輝，團體冠軍馮國浩，澳門隋英台柱余祖冕，陶英球員羅文輝，廣州名手鍾恩榮，實力本屬雄厚，但數年未獲機會練習，球技生疏，故以二比十三不敵滬星。三十日强華上陣，强華各將均廣州素負盛名之輩，更加入陶英新將李華貴，本屬不同凡响，惟除李華貴外，餘皆久疏練習，演出殊無精彩，獨李華貴勇戰，連勝滬星最卓越之王友信·陸漢俊兩人，僅爲强華奪回二分而已，成績爲十三比二，滬隊大勝。卅一日普强聯隊迎戰，聯隊有梁焯輝，傅宗堃·余祖冕·李華貴·胡國良上陣，仍以十三比二見負。</p>
<p>滬星隊各塲比賽罷，四月一日晨乘廣九快車赴港，即日轉輪返滬，該隊曾得廣州市長歐陽駒。澳門總督衛伊拉，港督羅富國等歡迎。（雷學鑫自廣州寄）</p>

<h3>基金監理常委會　昨開首次會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年短期庫券及美金公債基金監理委員會第一次常務委員會，於昨日下午四時起，在中央銀行會議室舉行。到常委並主委李馥蓀，常委王曉籟，秦潤卿，吳任滄，陳炳章。又國行張總裁，及該會委員徐永祚，歐陽崙等，亦列席參加。討論迄六時許散會。主要議案二起：（一）草擬該會辦事規則，擬在該會之下，設：（甲）保管基金組，（乙）監理產業組。（二）草擬建設政府有關維持債信之條呈。聞該會辦公處，將設於本市香港路銀行公會大厦內。</p>
<h3>白報紙到處有黑市　希望輸管放寬限額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市報業二月至四月間之白報紙進口限額三千噸刻已核准半數進口。尙有半數，可望在本月底前，核准進口。至書業二月至四月之進口限額四〇五〇噸，刻因各書商申請數額頗爲零星，正待各書商合組成一定甲請噸位後，再由各進口洋行代定。聞世界白報紙供應國加拿大，刻對世界各國白報紙之供應，亦採分配制。對我國亦有定額之分配。該項配給白報紙，其上海碼頭之交貨價，每噸使美金一百六十元。惟上海之黑市價，包括關稅運費在內，每噸已合美金三百五十元。該項配給白報紙在美國各地之交貨價，每噸爲美金八十四元。惟美國之黑市價，每噸亦已達美金二百元。舊金山黑市價，每噸已達美金二百廿五元。今設如因我國限額進口關係，對已分配到之廉價白報紙配額，即將移給他國，結果實屬我國經濟及文化界之鉅大損失。故有關方面，甚望輪管會當局，應儘量放寬該項廉價白報紙之進口限額。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕週來白報紙以外帮發動採運，價格逐步挺秀，每令的在十一二萬元之譜。外帮中特以北帮爲最活躍。緣北方海港方解凍不久。天津靑島等地，採辦亦轉殷切。又悉：香港一地，經由廣州漢口而販運至各地之白報紙，數亦可觀。有一時期，漢口白報紙以到貨充塞，價格較滬反康，致反有貨來滬運銷云。</p>

<h3>延安進軍</h3>
<p>— 三月廿一日宣川快訊　本報駐陝記者黎靑</p>
<p>馬欄一役後，對峙綫上兩方兵力，均有增無减。此次延安進軍，僉認爲前者之第二幕，或前者乃後者之揭幕序曲。</p>
<p>共軍方面，本月初，據報：有兩個至三個旅以上，由晋西抽調渡河，企圖加强延安南綫，著名之賀龍所屬三五八旅與三五九旅，即係西調增援陝北之兩個旅番號。共軍之部署，據傳係以延安保衛團，新四旅，三五八旅，三五九旅爲延安之城防部隊，而在其東南，西南，正南三方面所集結之共軍，尙有警備一，二，三，四等四個旅，新八旅，新九旅，教導一旅，教導二旅，二七師，一二零師，及騎六師。綜計其全部兵力，除民兵增加至十萬以外，正規之共軍，最多時亦達六七萬之衆。此數字，較諸戰事開始前一週，最低限度增加三分之一至二分之一。而在若干軍事據點上如臨眞鎭，金盆灣，牛武鎭諸地，所增加者恐在平時之一倍至二倍以上。</p>
<p>戰事自發生至攻陷延安止，其重心在延安洛川公路綫正面與乎公路綫東側間開展。其間所經歷之戰塲，並不如理想中廣闊，質言之：略似一等邊三角形，以延安爲三角頂點，以洛川縣城至朱家灣（宜川縣城西北）之聯結綫爲底邊，全面積約二千餘方公里。惟該地區多山嶺，若干高地間僅餘羊觴小道，故就地形言，實有利於守方。就地勢言：抑亦不利於攻方，蓋由關中盆地北行至陝北山嶽地帶，係自低朝高，耀縣銅川以北允甚。國軍此次進軍延安，冒險選擇此一困難之地區，作爲行軍之主要路綫，可能出於中共首腦所未預及。抑吾人亦尙憶及：一二個月前某某數種刋物，預測進攻延安之路綫，看重於來自西南方。</p>
<p>國軍未突破前之碉堡錢所經據點，略如附圖所示。共軍之第一綫重要據點，西起自鄜縣縣城，中經交道鎭龍泉鎭，西達臨眞鎭，其間距離，的六七十公里。在此第一綫之略。北尙有牛武鎭與淸泉鎭，亦爲雙方爭奪之重要據點。依地形地勢與共軍部署而觀之，共軍之第二道防綫似係在甘泉縣城之略，北與乎東側之金盆灣，其間距離不及三十公里。金盆灣，即賀龍總指揮部之所在。故或謂此次由西安到延安，其路程不過係由洛川到金盆灣。</p>
<p>十四五日，即戰爭揭幕後之第一二日，雙方戰况未甚劇烈。第一個高潮爲第三日，亦即金盆灣之爭奪戰。十六日國軍將之克復，翌日復攻佔甘泉縣城，前述之等邊三角形戰塲，至此已截開一半。</p>
<p>第二個高潮爲甘泉以北之勞山一役，共軍利用險要高地，集中五個旅之兵力（獨一旅，警二旅，警三旅，新四旅，新八旅）由賀龍親自指揮。國軍將士，幾經浴血，始攻佔若干重要高地。延至十八“下午，國軍越過山脊，從此下坡，而直趨延安城。</p>
<p>舉世矚目之延安進軍，其先頭部隊之前進哨兵，係十九日拂曉進入，屬第一師羅烈將軍所部。（金盆灣一役，該師戰功甚高）。午前八九時左右，先頭部隊相　開入，經一度小規模之巷戰，此號稱「民主聖地」之延安，從茲不復見鐮斧交叉之紅旗。戰鬥經歷，幾五天六夜。</p>
<h3>民主列車開動了（下）</h3>
<p>— 陳顧遠</p>
<p>罷免制度的成例，罷免案如經否決時，對於同一被聲請罷免人在其本屆任期內，不得再爲罷免之聲請。其理由不外避免聲請罷免人的意氣用事，濫請罷免，且可使被聲請罷免人安心任事，不致意存畏縮。然而這種設計究覺限制罷免權過甚，對於國民大會代表實無採用之必要。但在立法委員方面因經常過問政事，並負有立法工作，原選舉區或單位的選民必希望其爲一地方一團體而謀特殊的利益。倘其人稍存公正觀念，顧全國家利益，勢必爲原選舉區或單位的選民所不滿如無補救規定，就難免各該地的選民連二連三地爲罷免的聲請，這種威脅太厲害了！所以立法委員選舉罷免法中就規定：罷免案如經否決，對於同一立法委員在原任期內不得再爲罷免之聲請。監察委員選舉罷免法中亦有類似規定，即罷免案如經否決，原聲請人對於同一監察委員在原任期內不得再爲罷免之聲請。總統副總統選舉罷免法仍如此例，規定罷免案如經否決，對於同一總統副總統，原聲請人不得再爲罷免之聲請。這不過是原聲請人不得再爲聲請，以外的人仍可依法爲罷免之聲請。</p>
<p>（六）罷免案的成立與通過</p>
<p>罷免聲請書的提出須有若干選民的簽署，道和對候選人的簽署提名是同樣有愼其事。然而法定的簽署人數過少固欠鄭重，過多也感困難。各國成例對於一般罷免案之提出其所需簽署的人數，最多者爲選民百分之三十，最少者爲百分之五。中國初行罷免制度，關於罷免聲請書的提出，不用說要依通例須經各該選舉單位當選時投票總數百分比若干人的簽署，方得提出。然而百分比數究竟如何決定，才與理論事實有所配合。在國民大會代表及立法委員的罷免方面是採了「原選舉單位當選時投票總數百分十以上選舉人之簽署」辦法。臀如說，當選國民大會代表的時候，自已雖以二十萬票當選，但當選時却有五十萬人在這個選舉單位投票，罷免聲請書的簽署人，就得在五萬人以上；立法委員的選舉區較大，百分十的人數也比較地多。在監察委員的罷免方面是採了各選舉會選舉人總額四分一以上選舉人之連署的辦法。譬如說一個市議會只有十六名議員，至少須有四個議員的連署方得提出罷免聲請書。在總統副總統的罷免方面，是採了國民大會代表總額六分之一以上之代表簽名蓋章的辦法，如以國民大會代表作二千九百三十七名計，罷免聲請書至少應有四八九點五的入，老實說就是四百九十入的速署，方得提出。這種稱規定無非想使罷免案的提出較爲鄭重，但百分比却也不見得過高，想提出罷免聲請書並非極端困難的事。　罷免聲請書的提出，在國民大會代表或立法委員的罷免方面，是向原選舉單位之主管行政機關首長提出。主管行政機關首長於收到聲請書三十日內查明簽署屬實及其人數合於規定之後，應將聲請書副本通知被聲請罷免人，於收到後十五日內提出答辯書。答辯書收到後，三日內連同聲請書公吿之，俾選舉人在投梨以前，對於罷免案正反兩面有認識判斷的根據，然後在公吿後三十日內舉行投票。在監察委員的罷免方面，是向原選舉各該省市議會的議長或蒙藏委員會僑務委員首長提出罷免聲請書，其他的程序與立法委員的罷免爲同。在總統副總統的罷免方面，是將罷免聲請書送交國民大會秘書長公吿之，自公吿之日起三十日內如無人否認簽署的事實或雖有否認而簽署人仍足六分之一時，罷免案就成立，即將聲請書咨送立法院院長。立法院院長將其副本咨送被聲請罷免人，並召集國民大會於一個月內舉行臨時會。被聲請罷免人接到聲請書副本後，向國民大會提出答辯書，並由國民大會秘書長公吿之。　罷免案的通過，在立法委員選舉罷免法上係規定以當選時投票總數之過半數贊成票通過罷免案，道是極公平而合理的。因爲如不以當選時之投票總數過半數計算，那麼，罷免投票之投票總人數若爲數極少，雖以過半數計算，在實際上却爲極少數人通過的罷免案了。反而言之，今以當選時之投票總數過半數計算，那麼，當選時以比較多數當選，罷免時以過半數罷免，稍稍加高，實合於罷免應較選舉更爲愼重的道理。國民大會代表選舉罷免法的規定，對此雖無「當選時」三字，其施行條例中或有補充的規定。在監察委員選舉罷免法，因監察委員係由議會議員對其爲罷免之投票，故不發生此種問題，僅用無記名投票法以所投票數總額之過半數贊成票通過之。在總統副總統選舉罷免法上，規定用無記名投票法以代表總額過半數之贊成票通過罷免案，也可以說是做當選時的數字而計算了。</p>
<p>罷免案通過後，被罷免人的缺額在國民大會代表或立法委員方面係由候補人依次遞補。本來，關於繼任人選可有數種辦法：（一）係於罷免案通過法，依法舉行選舉；這是最公允而無流弊的辦法，但其缺點為乎續繁重。（二）係對罷免案的可束及繼任人選在同一票上表示，凡贊成罷免案者同時圈選繼任後選人，罷免案如通過，便以得票較多的候選八爲當選；這在程序上雖較簡略，然依我國今日情形言之，亦或不便。（三）係由任命產生，這是違反民主的辦法。（四）係任其缺額，這種辦法除在婦女方面因無婦女繼任人時，可採用此一辦法，但通常情形中如缺額過多，開會不足法定人數，也就搆成嚴重局面。（五）係由候補人依次遞補，這種辦法雖說或不免於候補人故意發動罷免聲請之嫌，然在事實上旣不易舉行補缺選舉，而罷免案之成立與通過亦皆非一舉即可成功，因而在中國初創罷免制度即不能不採這個辦法。反而言之，監察委員的補缺選舉較易，於是監察委員罷免後之繼任人即不採候補制度，而以選舉方法產生。至於總統經罷免而解職，由副總統織任至前任總統原任期屈滿之日爲止，在另一解釋上也可說是近似候補制度。</p>
<p>以上各段是我對四種選舉罷免法之要點分析。</p>
<p>（七）新時代國</p>
<p>除了總統副總統選舉罷免法以外，其他三種選舉罷免法都有施行條例及各選舉單位的名額分配表，正在立法院審議中。因而還有不少關於選舉罷免的問題，如選舉經費，軍士投票，選民與選區，婦女與選區，簽署人數不實，選舉權證式樣等等問題及一切施行時候的技術問題，在施行條例方面當必有詳密的規定。然而從這種四種選舉罷免法中已可充分地知其綱領所在，使民主的列車開動起了。今年九月以前完成國民大會代表立法委員及監察委員的選舉，於十二月二十五日國民大會開會後，完成總統副總統的選舉，一切分別依各該選舉罷免法而行。在　本子上談民主，那是紙上文章，漲一張嘴講民主，那是空中樓閣，也可以說都是未出車廠的製造圖樣或機車。有了這種種選舉罷免法而公布而施行，就無異把一都列車開出車廠，放在軌道上升火開動，這纔是見諸實際的民主政治。</p>
<p>由於有關憲法十種法律的公布。尤其是各種選舉罷免法，使我深切感覺到中國今後是走向民主的新方向，爲中國數千年來大變局之一。中國在春秋以前，封建政治中階級顯然，士之子恒爲士，農之子恒爲農，這是世家握政，平民不能抬頭。戰國局面一變，縱橫之士遊說各國，朝爲布衣，夕爲卿相。兩漢以鄕舉里選取士，六朝以閱閥門第間政，局面各不相同。隋唐偏重考試，士子初猶不慣，甚以投牃自薦爲恥。然行之旣久，寒門素讀終可脫頴而出，平章國事。自淸末以迄民國三十年來，保舉風氣甚盛，局面又異於前。憲法公布，今後人民都能過問公家事，所由之道全賴選舉，並以罷免補其缺點，這是簇新的制度，要看我們如何去適應，如何本於各該種選舉罷免法而行，藉而發揮這一部民主的列車的力量。猛進啊！猛進啊！新時代在開始了，新中國在出現了，向民主的道路上猛進啊！</p>

<h3>略談讀書方法</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>讀書的目的在求知，而其終極則爲實踐。績書的過程，應該是一個動的發展的生活實踐的過程。這就是說，譜書必求致用。最初我們必須要從書中學習一些東西，每本書都是有條理的，不能僅僅了解枝節，句　詞意以外，要握住一個思想的體系。書中所陳述的理論，都有一個　　系統，從然了解形式而不從實際上着眼，一定不能算是眞正的了解。任何一木書，又都有一個中心，理論的叙說，有些頁可說是陪襯，不都是骨幹。此外，更要明暸一部書的叙述方法，看它碼制及組織情形如何，這好像屬於形式，實則與理諭大有關係，對於把握思想的體糸，把握邏輯，把握中心都有一貫的聯繫。</p>
<p>學習到一點槪念和知識了，必須進一步的運用思想。不能老造接受人家的思想，應該建立自己的思想。這時就得抱懷疑明態度，有了懷疑，就能產生思維的判斷作用。懷疑和批評都須注意事實，將書中所說的和自已所見，所聞，所經歷的作一對照。批判要有立塲，忽視了本質的，繫個的，科學的事實，那思想就立不住足了。</p>
<p>要使所獲得的知識和自己的思考統一起來，並加以深化廣化，最好是隨讀隨寫，隨思隨寫，筆記和摘要的功夫，對於治學有很大的帮助。讀過某書後，不妨寫一篇書評，沒有什麽可評，但把內容要點扼要地摘錄出來也行。讀書一定要有心得，至少也得抓住若干重要的意念，總不能一無印象，任槪念和思想在眼前掠過。所以讀書一定要取認眞的能度，切不可馬馬虎虎，一看就算了。梁啟超說：「讀書如攻城略地，必集全副精力於其上」。我想，讀書的趣味和心得，也惟有認眞切實讀書的人才能得到，才能體會到。</p>
<p>煨後應該談到致用的問題。我國古來大儒素主「學以致用」之說，不過很少人能理解此中眞義。從字面上證，致用可能有兩種解釋：一是認爲學問（我國人一向把做學問和讀書看做一回事）是用以濟世，爲解決實際問題所必需；一是認爲　學求知乃爲應世，謀生之資即在於此。當然，照第一種解釋是比較正確的。不過，生當今日，我們續賽還不當完全看做是一種「準備」功夫，應該使讀書利整個的「生活」發生關聯。讀書可以使眼界擴展，思路充暢改造生活經騐，增進生活意義。中國人對於讀書習慣的培養，實在太不注意，除了學生以外，社會上就沒有普這的讀書風氣，這是受了傳統敎育的影響。一般人把讀書和應用視爲兩件事，準備完畢（如學生在學校中讀書），應用就開始。應用時就無儒準備，就不用讀書，準備時只顧準備，讀書時不必想到應用。其實這是莫大的誤解，我們在讀書時就應顧到應用，讀書的過程，應看做是整個生活的過程。這裏所謂應用，不僅是讀過書以後可以拿書中的資料作引證，最重要的是用來應付生活的動境，解決實際生活上困難的問題。</p>
<p>總之，讀書的意義是把知識應用到實踐上去，而我們應採馭的讀書方法，就得貫澈道個理想，以動的發展的方法去讀書。</p>
<h3>評「工英文困學記」</h3>
<p>— 任文</p>
<p>方達文著　名山書局出版</p>
<p>至少在目前，英語已成了世界性的語文。據學者統計，全世界直接使用英語的人多達四億，間接和她發生關係的更不知多少。就語文本身言、英語在將來能吾改良進步成爲世界語，自然有許多問題，不在我們討論之列。今日市國各級學校，都以英語為第一外國語，每一個大學畢業生，在就學期間所耗於學習英語的時間，多得驚人，但這些人中，眞眞能够運用這種語言的爲數確實有限。於是，此事便成爲敎育上的一個嚴重問題。是語文本身困難呢？是敎學方法不善呢？是敎材選擇不當呢？是學習環境不適宜呢？可以說都是原因。因爲這個緣故，從事語文敎育的人，無時不焦思苦慮，求謀所以補救之還，在這方面收穫較大的莫議於敎材的不斷改編和補充讀物的出版。我們今日無論走到那一家書店都可以看到許多英語讀物，這些讀物；就筆者所知有一個共同的缺憾，就是不曾脫離轍人知識的方式，而缺乏啟發的作用。這個缺憾，今天給英文困學記彌補了。</p>
<p>這部書，據作者在序文中所說，依初中，高中，大學程度分爲上中下三卷，用故事體裁描成幾個學生學習英語的經過情形。在故事方面以一個原來對於英語毫無興越的學生林　義，因受環境影響，成爲絕端愛好英語的經過爲經，以他的同學師友相互指導研究爲緯；在英語知識方面以文法的邏輯發展爲經，由淺而深，由簡單而詳盡，循環反覆，像利笋一樣，而以應情應境的會話，讀本，作文，文章分析，及種種學習英語的方法爲穿插，使人續的時候，好像在閱讀小說，沒有枯燥乏味的感覺。</p>
<p>爲了敎學上的參考，我花了整整一個下午和晚上的時問讀完本書十四章，覺得其中有幾章特別值得推薦。如第二章受了女同學的刺激，第五章，滿牆的英文字，第六童小小的風沙，都極盡利用現實題材的能事。其趣味之濃厚，使人非看完此章木能釋手。最後兩章，綜合以前各章的知識，給初學英語的人開了一個繼續研究的門徑。大體上說來，這是一部很好的英語讀物；以學者爲出發，不以敎者爲出發是它的第一個特點；採用現實題材，隨機啟發，是第二個特點；從故事中啟導各種學習的方法，汴重養成習慣，沒有統教式的口吻，使人讀後有親切之感，是第三個特點。說到它的缺點，自然也不是沒有，譬如書中所引的材料，在文法方面爲納氏文法，（雖然作者特別重親引證例句，非納氏文法所能及）在績本方面爲泰西五十軼事，伊索寓言等，而對於近時報章雜誌上的文章反少引用；在讀習方面，賒舉了一個韋氏音標和國際音標外，對於初學英語的人，可以用文字表達的發音注意事項，和常犯錯誤的糾正，未能充分加以發揮；第九童所舉名詞，代名詞改錯句多達一百四十條，不能設法分散各處，閱讀起來稍嫌沈悶冗長，此外有些地方故事本身和英語知識，好像沒有什麽聯繫，也是美中不足。話雖如此，對於初學英語，或學習英語覺得困難和缺乏興遠的人，這是一部很有益處而值得一續再讀的書。如集作者認爲以上的批許值得參考，希望他能够在校閱申卷及下卷時稍稍加注意，同時幷希望它們能够早日問世。</p>
<h3>介紹一本優良的　化學工具書</h3>
<p>— 沈厥成</p>
<p>書名：化學藥品辭典　編者：高銛　出版：新亞書讓</p>
<p>辭典是治學的工具，讀英文的，少不了一本英文字典；研究化學的，自然必須一本化學辭典。但是在出版界裏一看，這種工具書，除了語言學以外，只有商務在民初出版了幾種動植物辭典。關於化學，寂然無聞搜求充數，亦不過能得到幾種小册簡編，僅可稱爲語彙而已。考求原因，正如編者自述：「辭典之作，固非易事」。化學辭典，尤爲繁雜。化學所治，乃物質之學；物質何存，不屬於動植，必入於礦物，於是言化學必及於動續礦，換句話說；必及於陣物之學。化學辭典必涉及於動植礦，更無疑義。只就化學說，爲物萬千，已經是五花八門，命名不易，再加入博物名詞，那更是錦上添花了。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，還遲不易出現的化學詞典，今日竟有一册問世。不過這是一部有關化學的藥品辭典，並不是化學辭典，所以許多有關化學的術語，方法和歷史人物等，都未提及，雖然有偏於一方之嫌，但在中國這種荒蕪文化界上，已經可稱爲化學上的一本極良的工且響了。</p>
<p>稱他爲極良，並非代編者誇張，更非爲書店宣傳，只因今日的出版界，受了多種的桎梏和困難，已經是奄奄一息，所見到的不過是些小本書籍，這種巨帙，差不多是無法刋行。縱有一二，也不是這種硬性的科學書籍。新亞書店能在這時候毅然出版，是值得種贊的。出版界寂寞，著作者自然消沉；在這個時候，決無人作這種企圖。我們以要一看序文上所誌時日，即可見編者的着手時日，去今已將十年，而所謂行將付印的時日，去今也已經四年，說他不，“當然不免。採用的許多名詞，多沿用固有者，似亦不免因襲。然編者自序云：「夫名者實之賓，名唯患其不定，患其無系統而已，優劣之爭，尚在其次。」所以動稍礦名詞；化學醫華名詞，均襲用固有者，無非取其通用而已，本書以英文本爲藍本，原書不到之處，均經補正；現在專將也的優點列在這裏。</p>
<p>（一）搜羅　當　我們只要將篇末所附英文索引，數一數頁數，看一看行數，可知所載名詞，約爲萬餘，同物而有異名的，當已正詳。除原書本列的以外，這補充輯入的工作，似亦非易舉，而亦可貴。</p>
<p>（二）內容充實除上述的英文名詞以外，編者更將華名廣爲搜列。並將分子式，分子量或原子序，原子量，原子價補入，在理論上，這些都是要項。在性狀常數以外，對於襲造方法，有由來及精製兩項。用途以外，更有品級及包裝，以明商品實况，自然是切於實用於項目。關於火災爆發等也別具專條。這些對於貯存運輸都是必須知織，在實用上，非常重要。還有點可以一述的，就是篇末附有各種常數表，爲實用上所不可缺。編者補充以後，自更完備。</p>
<p>（三）命名劃一　編者對於許多名詞都抱一種述而不作的態度，因此每一名詞大都有依據。許多俗名，別名，並不偏廢，附列其下，並各立專條，允便檢查。</p>
<p>（四）排列淸醒　首依筆劃，列其本名。具別名，或俗名的，加立括弧刋列其後。再次為附列之英文，用圓括弧附入，其不只一名者，用「；」區分。說明文字則分列多項，首爲化學式，其次爲性狀，常數……用途等均各用重方括孤區別，所以眉目極爲淸醒。</p>
<p>就這幾點者來，在前面我所以說他是一本極良的工具害了，編者在自序文內以光大望諸後人，是則編者固不認爲極良，而且希望此所謂極良者能隨時代以逝，代以後之所謂極良者。那末我為祖國的文化及學術着想，希望趨起者　接，不要和植物學動物學辭典一樣，幾十年不改一字，更不要幾十年無第二種出現，成了我國化學上的唯一寶典。</p>
<p>現在我更將經者介紹一下。織者高錯君，從事化學工程，其所建樹，略如張序所述，暇則兼事著述，其作品以前多由商務出版，所以在工程界上和著作界上，並不是生疏的人物，那末本書對於續者也不是生疏的文字了。</p>
<h3>「蘇聯史地」</h3>
<p>— 新俊</p>
<p>復興叢書之一·吳淸友著　商務印書館印行</p>
<p>美國前駐蘇大使台維斯在他所著的「出使草斯科記」裏面，關於蘇聯的觀感，這樣說：「蘇聯是個大國，蘇聯佔世界六分之一的面積，大約有全世界十分之一的人口。上帝賜給他們豐當的自然富源，礦產的，農業的，漁業的，森林的——與偉大精幹强壯的人民，蘇聯的潛力與它己表現出來的成就相稱，它命定了成爲世界最大強國之一。」</p>
<p>目前的世界，分割開來有二種類型——資本主義及社會主義，前者可以美英諸國爲代表，而後者則以蘇聯爲代表。</p>
<p>關於英美諸國——資本主義的形成，有不少靑年已很明瞭，而對於蘇聯這社會主義國家的形成，是很少有靑年認識的，但，按照目前的趨勢來看，對於蘇聯的認識是必需的。</p>
<p>以前本刋介紹過幾木研究蘇聯的書，而因這些是研究性的，並不適合於靑年閱讀，因爲靑年們在研究之前，必須先有認識。我現在所介紹的這本「蘇聯史地」，可以說是認識蘇聯的唯一的書籍。</p>
<p>在這本書裏面，告訴了靑年們蘇聯的史的發展，及其社會主義國家造成的原因，各方面均給蘇聯以明確的說明。每篇文字都值得我們去一續的。</p>
<p>這本畫的內容，是：</p>
<p>它先說明了蘇聯的地勢及疆界，山脈與河流，及其氣候產物，次述蘇聯的民族及人口，地理條件與蘇聯生產之分佈，以上是關於蘇聯地的部份，所述都很詳確。</p>
<p>接着，反說出了：上古及中古時代的俄羅斯，俄羅斯帝國之興起和沒落，十月革命與蘇聯之誕生，及至五年計劃時期的蘇聯，最後並說述了戰時的蘇聯。這關於史的部較地的部份更爲詳細正確除。</p>
<p>除此而外，這本書裏也說到蘇聯的經濟文化，以及蘇聯今後的動向。</p>
<p>這本書，可以說它是蘇聯槪况，雖然有的部份還簡略，但一般讀者，是很適宜來一讀此書，讀後一定使你對蘇聯有個相常的認識，然後，進一步的是研究蘇聯。</p>
<p>諸位在讀完這書後，要對蘇聯更深一步的認識，我們還可以看以下訊書：（一）「今日之穌聯」——吳淸友著，讀書版，（二）「出使莫斯科記」——台維斯著，亦有譯本，（三）「蘇聯歸來」——邵力子著，中國文化服務社版。在這些書都讀完之後，我可以確信，諸位對蘇聯一定有一個很深切的認識。至於研究蘇聯方面的書籍，那眞是太多了，我在這裏難以舉例。</p>
<p>總之，認識蘇聯，是今日靑年所必須的，這木「蘇聯史地」，是認識蘇聯的基礎牘物。讀後可以增進我們一門知識——瞭解了蘇聯。</p>

<h3>凱旋門</h3>
<p>— 雷馬克著　朱葆光譯　中外出版社印行</p>
<p>以前正言報的文藝副刋上，曾經長篇通載過雷馬克的小說「凱旋門」；那是由朱雯先生所譯的，常時很受一般讀者的注意；可惜後來不知爲了什麽緣故，忽然中途停轔下來，沒有給刋完。最近在書坊上，偶然發現了「凱旋門」的中譯本，譯者署名朱葆光；文筆亦頗雅達，可惜只是從原書的節本翻譯出來，我們還未能得窺全豹。</p>
<p>「凱旋門」是反戰，反納粹的著名作家雷馬克（Erich　Maria　Remarque）在一九四五年完成的作品，這部小說出版後，就轟動全讀書界，並且成爲去年春天美國最銷書之一。</p>
<p>這個故事的內容是這樣的：</p>
<p>德籍外科醫生拉維克，在一九三八年後被納粹黨驅逐出境，流浪到巴黎。他居住在一家古舊的小族店內，前面是廣塲，這裏在晚上，有着散亂的燈光，霧雨季節，紀念石塔下面，安躺着的無名英雄墓地，往往更顯得陰慘憂鬱，而那巍偉的凱旋門，就在離這裏不遠的地方。</p>
<p>拉維克在巴黎，沒有任鄒護照，他爲了要付房錢和飯錢，祗得在一位技術不甚高明的法國醫生那裏權當助手。亡俞者的生活是暗澹而寂實的；他無聊的時候，祗可以留在旅店的地下食堂裏抽抽烟，或是和一些流浪者談天說地；那個喚作「莫洛索」的俄國人，就是　雜克的好朋友，他是夜總會的看門人。</p>
<p>有一天晚上，抗雜克在歸途中，經過凱旋門的附近地帶，邂逅到一個女人。她彷彿受了一次重大的刺激，神智不很淸明，而且極疲乏，搖搖欲墜，大有跌倒的樣子，他趕緊扶着她，走到一家小酒館內休息，並且一同喝了些酒；之後，他又把這個無家可歸的女人安置在旅店內——拉維克這樣做了，完全是出於一點憐憫心，並沒有什應用意的。這個年靑的女人呌做瑪都茹昂，是一個流浪在這裏的義籍女伶，孤苦而無名；可是她有一頭美得奇怪的秀髮，舉止亦高雅；她穿着一套裁製精緻的藍衣服。</p>
<p>以後，經過拉維克的介紹，茹昂就在莫洛索所看守的夜總會裏賣唱，那裏有吉普賽人的樂隊，燈光極柔和，拉維克常在這裏消職掉好多時間：他開始發覺茹昂有着一張神秘的臉，充滿了困惑和嫵媚，這是在當初他從未看到過的。一次，他們在夜總會結束後的深夜裏，又痛飲了一回卡爾瓦多酒這——就是他們初遇時，在那家小酒館內所飲過的；常茹昂的手按放在拉維克的身上時；溫暖通過他的衣服，直達到他的心底，他感到親切，他的心漸漸由空虛而變成豐滿，他們彼此戀愛了。</p>
<p>不久，拉維克和茹昂在美麗的里維拉地方，度過八天　靜舒適的先活，這筆費用是拉維克剛得到的診金；他們在這個新　的地方，曾經滬樣幸福過：那月光下面，他們黑黑的身影，被彼此的脚步路碎亂了，他們喝着可口的香酒；更說着無數難以了解的　語，八天中的歡樂，超過以前八年所經　過的；可惜牠祗像八分鐘那般短促，一眨眼，就什麼都過了。</p>
<p>拉維克回到巴黎，遭遇到一件意外的不幸，他被警察捉去，而且又因爲發現他沒有護照，便被放逐到瑞士邊境，挨度過三個月工夫；等他釋放回來，茹昂已經和別的男人同居了，他感到氣憤和苦痛，，雖然茹昂仍舊表示愛他，要回到他身邊來，他却完全拒絕了。正在這個常口，拉維克在酒店裏遇到那個可怕的納粹特務—哈凱。哈凱來自柏林，他爲人陰奸兇狠，害殺過無數人，拉維克從前的愛人，就是被他所紋死的；這一决他不願輕意放鬆這個機會，他用了絕大的智慧與勇氣，謀害了哈凱，並將他的屍體，埋葬在荒野的灌木林裏，未曾留下一點痕跡；拉維克這才感受到報復後的痛快與輕鬆。</p>
<p>最後，茹昂亦被槍侮了，拉維克去醫治她已經太晚，他救不了她；那個曾經爲他所照顧和熱愛過的女人，終於躺在他的手膀裏，緊閉上了口層，那口唇最後所發出的聲靑，將永遠蕩漾在拉維克的耳邊；她對他說過：「我愛你」！</p>
<p>就在這天晚上，德國軍隊開始進攻波蘭，法蘭西迷浸在驚佈緊張的空氣裏，拉維克拿了他的衣箱和一條毯子，跟着警察跳上載重汽車，車子駛過凱旋門，廣塲上全瞳了，黑暗極了，他們甚致於都看不眞那伸入雲霄的，巨大而灰自的影十—凱旋門。</p>
<p>「凱旋門」是一部表現人類愛與憎的偉犬的小說；作者讓我們在他的創作裏，看到一幅眞實的圖畫：我們忘不了那個在納粹暴力下的亡命者，是怎樣懷着熱切的渴望，向着銀困的境遇掙扎着；拉維克是心」，他需要自由人的權利，他需要溫情的滋潤，他愛着，他被愛着；他又被鄙視務；他更向鄙視者施以報復；他終於把許多敵人之一的哈凱弄死了；這種辛酸冷酷的日子，他都挨過了；究竟是依靠着什麼呢？是一種什麽奇怪的力量在支撑着他呢？雷馬克在這裏告訴我們：因爲拉維克始終緊緊地擁抱抱着一件東西—那就是他的信仰。</p>
<p>憑着驚人的寫作按巧，和細膩的心理描寫，這部小說的，成功是無可置疑的；雷馬克除了在意識上有大的貢獻以外；他的文筆也很引人入勝，對白與叙述問，獨多警句，美麗而深邃，往往令人讀後深思，思後再讀：例如當茹昂重新回到拉維克的時候，他拒絕她證：「茹昂，你不要和我在一起，一個人，不能把風鎖起來，也不能把水銷起來，倘若他鎖，風和水就腐朽了，　禁閉起來的風，會變成腐朽的空氣，你走來就不是在任地方可以長久呆下去的」。又說：「醫生像女人一樣，我們監察死亡，你們監察愛情，世界上的一切理由，就在這事面」。</p>
<p>雷馬克是德國人，曾經參加過第一次世界大戰，受傷五次，戰後他曾當過敎師，石匠，汽車公司的檢騐駕駛員某種畫報的助理編轉；一九二九年他寫了一部轟動世界的小說「西綫無戰事」，起初曾被一個出版商所拒絕，後來求勉强爲另一出版商接受的；這部小說出版的第一年，單在德國就賣了一百廿萬册，並被譯成二十九種文字。自從納粹黨在德國　政後，他的書被禁，並且取消他的德國公民資格；一九三九年，他來到美國，現已申請美國公民的資格。</p>
<p>雷馬克的著作除了「西織無戰事」和「飢旋門」外，尚有「歸途」，「三伙伴」以復「浮荷」等作品。</p>
<p>（編者註：頃收朱雯先生來信，知其前在正言報分期刋載之本書譯文，近亦續譯完畢，正由文化生活出版社排印，定五月底出書。據此可知，此書已有二種中文譚本。</p>

<h3>「人生無謂」？</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>北平一靑年，因感人生無謂，本月一日闢北京飯店自殺。死前並奏「五月的風」一曲。（見本報四日北平電）這種死是屬於另一面的，也就是說，他不是屬於一般的因經濟壓迫或失戀失業的自殺。</p>
<p>一個人要探求人生問題，允其追系到屬於人生暫學這一類的問題，實在可說是自尋煩惱。人生便是人生，正如一條狗便是一條狗，一株樹就是一株樹。我們若要問到爲什麼生來做人，做人又爲什麽要這樣吃飯大便走路睡覺，的生活着，那末這一大事的問題，我們實有不勝其煩的解答。而且不追問不解答還好，一問一答，那問題使愈事愈多，愈說愈糊塗。結果到反把自己弄得莫明其妙起來。</p>
<p>我這樣說，不是呌人一味行屍走肉，糊里糊塗地過一天算一天。一個人想得遠了，要想把人生的奧妙問個淸楚我覺得不必，但懵懵懂懂地生活着也不應該。在這當中較爲折中些對人生看法，最好是使自己眼前的生活有個着落。我現在讀書，我就要把功課弄個淸楚；我做工，便該把這門工作確切地完成；當一個辦事員，就得使我所負的責任一絲不荀：總之，今天的人生，便是在完成今天的我所應做的工作。致於這份工作對社會人生有什麽補益？我又爲什麽要這樣做以及我做了又有什麼意思…這等遠離現實的想頭，最好就不要想牠。「只聞耘耕，不聞收穫，」這不是說不顧目的，而目的實在已就在耘耕當中了。</p>
<p>許多人過於計較功利，凡是覺得我的工作無補於將來的，就不願現在化費工夫，這樣，他往往就把時問空起來；空起來不要緊，但因爲空却發生許多非非的聯想。於是覺得無事可為，可為的又無意義。這位自殺的靑年，我相信他一定有太多的空閒，使他在這空閒中幻想出一個奧妙的人生問題，但可惜他終被這浩渺的問題吞蝕了他的現實人生。不然，他如果像一個早出晚歸的農夫或終日奔跑的車夫那樣的忙碌，他還那有工夫想到這個苦憐的問題，自然也不會自殺了。人生本無事，庸人自擾之！那些不把握現實而一味在那些不着邊際的問題上兜圈子的人，你說他聰明一世，其實是懵懂一生！</p>
<p>不過，話說回來，要是現實能使人滿意些，那末靑年人也許不會根本想到那些渺不可及的問題去了！</p>

<p>在今日談「師道」，一般認爲迂腐，開倒車，時髦的人，是不會聽得入耳的。不過，大家又很明白下一代民族是繼承這一代民族的，對他們的希望是很殷切無限的。然而，怎樣敎化他們，培植成爲有知識有能力的中流砥柱，方能肩挑這繼承前一代民族的重任，那末，負敎育責任的人，何等重要！政府新重了這一點，發起「師範敎育」運動週，喚起國人倡導師範敎育，提高敎師喲地位，織舞在學的師範生，使一向慾皮苦臉的敎育者，露着一剎那的微笑。——只是一剎那的微笑！</p>
<p>每次運動的發起，僅在初期鬧了開塲鑼鼓，很少有圓滿的收塲。別的運動如此，這「師範」運動，何嘗能脫此範疇？况且在這進動期間，鑼鼓並不響亮，那是很容易被人遺忘的。那些大人光生們，更不會感着興趣的；大學敎授在鬧津貼；中小學敎師的生活，尤其是含辛茹苦，勉力掙扎；那些師範生，更不顧同學的訕笑，埋頭學習。因爲，學師範的人，他的前還，早就註定了。好像學普通科有前途，可以升學深造，於是就驕傲，輕視學師範的人。師範生抱着「我不入地獄，誰入地獄？」的精神，「敎育救國」的信念，實在值得欽佩；可惜，畢業即失業，雖有爲敎育而獻身的抱負，往往這個願望不得實現的很多很多。一有機緣，都改了職業。否則，也只得成年整日地失意潦倒。還有什麽人注意他們呢？過去師範生的悲哀如此，未來的何敢奢求？</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>「錦上添花」不如「雪裏送炭」，因爲添花錦上並不是很必要的事。而在寒冷中多麽需要溫暖啊！</p>
<p>我特別愛向上的寂寫感，因此我喜歡接近流落江湖老了的貴胄和白了　的紅粉傳球珍。</p>
<p>因為風　中的情誼會比無邪的天眞，更爲可愛。</p>
<p>風塵中的中年，正是關　中的二九年華。　　女子如桃李，見重在色；風　女子如梅花，重在氣息。</p>
<p>久經滄海的情感不易動，如動，則不能抑。</p>
<p>比起「人盡可夫」的太太之流，風農中幗是價得被尊敬的。</p>
<p>有人說：「時間與空間是感情的函數」，顯然的，我非常不喜歡這句話。我不相信所有老朋友都是好朋友。</p>
<p>王勃云：「海內存知己，天涯若比隣」。這體會是值得寳貴的。</p>
<p>釋氏謂，見面己了；著「見了」二字。所以人之相知，不必定求晤對。王十獻訪截安道，未入其門即返。他替自己解釋道：「吾本趁興而往，盡興而返；何必見戴？」遠種在好友前盡量表現自我的精神，遠比一般晋人底作僞的濟譚高明得多。</p>
<p>但丁九歲時在刹那間不是確定他終生　綣的愛戀嗎？這　結不是昇華爲　燦的詩底經典——「神曲」嗎？又有誰敢　他不是最美麗的感情呢？</p>
<h3>論剛毅之剛愎</h3>
<p>— 慕陶</p>
<p>剛毅爲庚子罪魁之一，亦爲阿諛詔迎之尤，其出身係繙譯舉人，（此乃專指繙譯滿洲文，淸時有此一科，非繙譯各國文字也）。雖不至胸無點墨，而文理之荒謬，見解之糊塗，滿人大僚中，亦所罕有。乃出任開府，入贊樞廷，東朝用此等人，眞所謂鄭五爲相，時事可知矣。</p>
<p>光緒甲午以後，庚子以前，西宮日益水火，附慈禧，附德宗者，乃各樹一黨，剛則慈禧黨之中堅也。故恒語人曰：我們皇上，必須學大舜王，蓋諷刺光緒之不孝，以迎合慈禧。其任刑部尚書也，到任之日，大集僚屬曰：我們做刑部官，須學皋陶，（即續如本字曰陶）刑曹之任大烏布（烏布係滿語爲所任之差）者，漢人非兩榜，亦必正途出身，聞此無不掩　胡盧。其任江蘇巡撫也，自命爲施世綸，（則舊劇中之施公）而以龍殿揚爲黃天霸，甚至形諸章奏，故翁松禪爲作一絕曰：「帝降爲王轟大驚，皋　掩耳怕聞名，而今又有黃天覇，誰是當年賽二墩。」剛知之，恨翁刺骨，翁爲德宗師傅，當然黨於德宗，剛於慈禧前，媒產其短，（剛結交李蓮英甚厚）遂至有戊戍之罷斥，甚至交地官嚴加管束，而以所捐愛國捐五萬金入贓罰庫，其所以羞辱之，予以種種難堪，惟恐不至？實則剛之中繙譯舉人，翁實爲考官，有師生之誼，乃如此反噬，其人誠鄙夫哉。先公於乙未入樞廷，與之同列者四年，會謂予等曰：晋吳劉鼎之摺，剛每讀鼎爲才，翁告之曰：此字不念作才，剛反詰翁曰：爲什麽孫家兼之鼎字，念作乃啊？其剛愎不通，有如此者。無怪阿諛慈禧，信任義和團，貽禍國家，身死名裂而不悔也。</p>
<h3>憶舊事</h3>
<p>— 周庭梧</p>
<p>遜淸盛（宮保）宣懷氏，東渡考察廠礦曾晤及伊藤博文氏，彼亟言：中日　國，其應慎密交誼，萬勿使外侮乘內　而生，設一旦有變故，則日本慮唇齒之寒，亦豈能袖手坐視？貴大臣爲二十年舊交，故不憚一訴衷曲，並有八字奉贈日：「顧全大局，不爭小事。」當爲貴大臣所樂聞。不知其後任者飛揚跋扈，視中國爲禁　，底歸碰壁。按其輩出爾反爾，宜乎有此報應也。</p>
<p>新知識</p>
<h3>有聲電影活動房子</h3>
<p>— 君旋</p>
<p>最近我參觀過一架破題兒第一回運到中國約有聲放映機，覺得它很可以利用爲推動電化敎育的工具，故把它介紹一下：</p>
<p>機身頗爲巨大，頗似一間方形的小屋，下面有四隻輪子，推動起來，是很輕便的。該機的內部是漆黑的，有聲放映機影片，擴音器，和一切的機件，都安置在這裏面。銀幕是一塊方形的鈹璃，裝置於該機的前面的上截，外表上看來，它好像是一架無綫電傳影的收音機。</p>
<p>把電源接通之後，指示燈便發出紅光，再把發動的機鈕一撳，電影便會在那塊玻璃的銀幕上活動起來，影片的畫面，是從該機的事面反射出來的，同時擴音器也把聲帶上的錄書播放出來了</p>
<p>它最新奇的特點，就是可以把每部四百尺的影片，四部或一千六百尺的影片一部，自動運續週而復始循環放映。此外一經裝置妥當之後及發動之後，它是會得自己照料自己的，就算是機件發生了什麼障碍—，如影片中斷了，太緊或太寬了—，它是會得自動停止，把電流截斷的。</p>
<p>裝置的手續是很節單：（一）把所要循環放映的片子，繞進一個特製的片盤裏；（二）從這個片号的內圈及外圈，總共抽出的莫八尺的影片；（三）把這抽出的片子，即片首和片尾膠接起來；（四）經過幾偶「滾輪」和鏡頭之後，內　的片子便恰好地陛　地問　到片盤的外圍。其所以能够循環不斷地放映的原故，就是由於片首和片尾膠接的聽明的機械設計。</p>
<p>敎有課本片子，大抵是四百尺爲一部，把四部（即四個題材）膠接在一起，便可放映四十分鐘。每晚倘若放映四小時，便可以自動地循環六决，每次的觀衆若爲一百人，每晚便可以敎教六百人，每月便有二萬人，由於電影而獲得學術上的知識了。從普及民衆敎教上說，它的確是一件值得注意的工具。</p>

<h3>錢·財富</h3>
<p>— 阿林</p>
<p>乞乞科夫的父親死前留給他兒子的不是一宗財產，而是一句終身受用不盡的話：最可信任喲就是錢。</p>
<p>站在生活前面，錢，的確是最好不　的，它可使一個人從十三等文官跳到一二等文官去，他也可使嚴華貴的小組不問你的出身，而垂靑於你，在鄉村，日中爲市，還可物物交易，在都市，如果你沒有它，會覺得天下之大，容不下你了。錢，是你與生活間的一條橘樑。</p>
<p>也因此，越是充分生活的，越是愛得錢的重要。也因此，越是與錢前涉的，越是覺得它的可愛。這所以，為什麼在金湖有老虎，為什麼中央銀行裏也有高級職員藉職務的便利而購買黃金了。</p>
<p>一位詩人曾經形容過錢，說它是一種不道德的細菌。其實說細菌，不如譬如做酵母更好，它使一個人的慾望發酵，而無盡止。本來財富的起源就是值得研究的，原如的人類除了勞作，就是爭奪。時日推移到今天，也是一校，交易所中空多的爭奪就是一例，黃金，百物的哄抬，其實還不是對小民的掠奪嗎？正席喲勞作，是不會使財富在五分鐘的增加千百倍的，要發就得暴，這裏祗容得下不正當喲行徑。這所以，在今日，一個正當商人值常不作經營，並不是不想經營，而是覺得這樣的經營是不合理的，不忍心的。</p>
<p>一次黃金潮，使多少人瘦了，餓了，究竟在這機會裏　富的沒有幾人。雖說要查，要辦，使如中央銀行折購金諸公，不過開革了事，瞭來的錢，還是在自己荷包裏的。亡羊補牢，已經晚了。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>有辦法嗎？愛麗，告訴你，到國家也鬧到沒有辦法的時候，個人無論怎樣有辦法，也不會再有辦法了！」忽然他發覺這些話對金愛麗講，未免類乎對牛彈琴，便立刻改變一種說法。「總之，愛麗，你現在千萬別把我比徐胖子，諸老頭兒！他們是天神天將，我是小鬼！你看我還有什麼辦法呢？」</p>
<p>金愛麗噗哧一笑。</p>
<p>「笑什麼？」老祝裝得鄭重地說：「就是你，現在也比我好多了！你是仙女！不是明兒你就要走了嗎？」</p>
<p>「那末，要不要我帮帮她們的忙？」老祝的話在金愛麗聽了，倒眞成了百分之百的恭維，因此更使她高興起來。</p>
<p>老祝躊踟了一下。他知道至少在這幾天裏，金愛麗是諸老頭兒的一件活實，由她去說幾句話，可能會發生效力的，然而蘭的個性他太淸楚了，對於自己，　尚且不肯輕易啟齒相求，怎麼會顧意來看金愛　和諸協理的顏色呢？</p>
<p>「好吧！不過我得光問問她們自己去！」他用手中抹了抹嘴唇，「回頭要是　們眞上不了火車，我一定來打你。諸老頭兒住的地方我知道。」</p>
<p>金愛麗有意地看了他一眼。</p>
<p>「你要我怎麼微，我就怎慶做。」她柔顧地說。</p>
<p>「好，謝謝你，愛麗。」老祝也顯得很高興的樣子。他站起來先付摔了賬，不張愛麗有跟他搶的機會。</p>
<p>將出門的時候，她又熱情地拉住了老祝的手，股勤地問：</p>
<p>「你自己究竟打算什麽時候走呢？」</p>
<p>老祝很知道她的心地，同時也十分明瞭她對自已所有的好感。</p>
<p>「你們先走吧！」老祝像撫慰一個　子似的說：「我到貴陽的時候，一定來打你！」</p>
<p>他把她送上汽車之後，便跨着大步，遙望藝術館走去。這一天的局勢，果然顯得特別的緊張，盧前張昌那一班人全失掉了原有的鎭定的心理，大家都透着很慌張的神氣，催促老祝趕快決定走不走，幾時走，和怎樣走的原則。從早上起，老祝　整的忙了大半天；開會，打電話，找人，準備　，直到下午四五點鐘模樣，才略略有了一些一頭緒。</p>
<p>他斜躺在一張破舊的大籘椅上，接連吃了三四塊花生糖，正打算體稍休息一下。突然，一個念頭浮上了腦際。「哎！」他失聲驚呼着。（三九）</p>

<h3>The Curtain Rises on the Great Battle of Southern Shanxi: Quwo and Jishan Under Siege; Nationalist Forces From Northern Shaanxi to Join Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] Taiyuan Report: The Communist forces in Southern Shanxi have launched a full-scale offensive, making a major battle inevitable. The future campaign in Southern Shanxi will likely occur near Yuncheng. After the Communist forces successively captured Jicheng, Houma, Xinjiang, and other places, they besieged Quwo. Fierce fighting is now taking place in the north and west of the city. Nationalist forces are bravely resisting, but the Communist forces have not yet succeeded. Mengcheng, a town belonging to Quwo, is also under siege. At the same time, fighting has also begun in Wenxi. At dawn on the 8th, Jishan and Hejin counties were also besieged by four regiments of Communist forces, and fierce fighting is underway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 9th] The Nationalist forces that recovered Anbian continued to clear out the remaining Communist forces in the vicinity on the 9th. The 90-li transportation route from Anbian to Dingbian has now been completely restored.</p>
<p>[Our Yan'an Dispatch, 8th] Commander Hu Zongnan hosted a banquet at his military headquarters at 7 PM on the 8th to entertain press delegations from Wuhan and Xi'an. During the banquet, he predicted to reporters that the Communist forces in Northern Shaanxi had lost their will to fight and that Suide could be recovered by the end of this month, and the situation in Northern Shaanxi could gradually be clarified by the end of May.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] It is widely rumored here that the Nationalist forces in Northern Shaanxi captured Suide and Mizhi on the 8th. There are also reports of the capture of the northern city of Mizhi (Mizhi has a north and south city, separated by half a li), but these have yet to be confirmed. The battle for the outer strongholds of Suide continues on the 9th. Troops have entered and exited Dahuiping and Guojiawan several times. Another unit of Nationalist forces cut off the Wubu-Suide highway, and the two armies are engaged in a fierce battle on the highway. Several small villages on Jiuli Mountain have been captured by the Nationalist forces. After the Nationalist forces reached the foothills of Beishan from Shizui, the Communist forces launched three counterattacks from Shizui against the Nationalist positions but failed. The Communist forces on the mountain appear to be withdrawing. The joining of the northern and southern Nationalist forces will occur within a few days. The Communist forces continue to cross the Yellow River into Shanxi via Xiliyu, Wanhu Valley, Pantang, and Shaomao Head.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 9th] Several thousand remnants of the Communist 359th Brigade yesterday afternoon fled to Baijiaping and Lijiapo, northwest of Panlong Town. Over five thousand remnants of Wang Zhen's forces fled to Liujiajie. The remnants of the Communist forces on the Shaanxi-Gansu border, in the Fotang and Yangbaotou area south of Zhengning County, led by Communist commander Wang Wenxin, are attempting to collude with the remnants of the "Police Second Regiment" and "Police Third Regiment" hiding in Xunyi's Shimen Pass and Yao County's Zhaojin Town, seeking an opportunity to spy on the north bank of the Jing River.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Hebei Besiege Zhengding; Part of the Hutuo River Railway Bridge Destroyed; Nationalist Forces in Northern Henan Approach the Outskirts of Tangyin</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 9th] The flames of war in Rongcheng on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway have barely subsided, and the Communist forces on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section besieged Zhengding again last night. The fighting is fierce. The defending troops have resolutely resisted for a day and a night. Several strongholds in the suburbs have been captured by the Communist forces. The field army that previously fled to Ding County and Central Hebei has been transferred to reinforce the attack and to prepare for an offensive against Shijiazhuang. The situation in Shijiazhuang is becoming tense. The commanding officer of the defending forces telegraphed the pacification headquarters for emergency assistance at noon on the 9th, but the strength of the Communist forces has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The Communist forces outside Shijiazhuang, with the aim of destroying the Hutuo River Railway Bridge, launched a fierce attack on the Nationalist strongholds near Shijiazhuang with over 5,000 men last night. The Nationalist positions on the Hutuo River Bridge were attacked simultaneously, and the fighting was very fierce. The sound of gunfire shook Shijiazhuang. Part of the railway bridge was eventually destroyed. Nationalist forces from Shijiazhuang and Zhengding reinforced the area. The Communist forces retreated at 7 AM on the 9th. Train service between Shijiazhuang and Xin'an has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 9th] The Nationalist forces that entered Anxin County had completely occupied Liujiakou, Dayin Town, Zhabankou, and other important points by yesterday, and recovered over 20 villages. They continued to pursue and suppress the remaining Communist forces in the area six kilometers from the city on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The rapid units of the Nationalist forces in Northern Henan crossed Hong County on the morning of the 8th and continued to pursue the retreating Communist forces northward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 9th] The large-scale Nationalist forces in Northern Henan crossed the Hong River on the 9th and approached the outskirts of Tangyin, which is about to be relieved. The main force is now fighting at Caiyuanji, 20 li northeast of Tangyin. According to reports from the front, there are still over 30,000 Communist forces invading Northern Henan, with signs of retreating to Daming in Southern Hebei.</p>
<h3>Li Zongren Returns to Beiping</h3>
<p>Talks with Our Newspaper Reporter</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] Li Zongren returned to Beiping from Nanjing on the Zhuiyun (Chasing Clouds) aircraft at 1:30 PM on the 9th. He was accompanied by Hebei Inspector Li Sicong, Hebei Provincial Party Committee Chairman Wang Bingjun, and Su Ting, Director of the Education Department of Hebei Province. Leaders including Sun Lianzhong all went to the airport to welcome him. After returning to his residence, Li met with our newspaper reporter and stated: (1) All the rumors about me outside are inaccurate. I have requested the Chairman's permission to go to the United States for treatment twice due to chronic stomach problems, but both were denied. (2) The reorganization of the government is a major matter and requires detailed discussion, but it has not been stopped. After the reorganization of the government, there will be no changes in the military and political affairs of North China. Rehe has a very close relationship with Beiping in terms of economy and culture, and it is hoped that it will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters. This matter still needs to be decided by the Supreme National Defense Council. (3) The central government is very concerned about North China. The opening of the Tianjin-Pukou and Beiping-Hankou railways is already planned. Materials for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are being actively prepared. The opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will be carried out simultaneously without waiting for the elimination of the Communist forces in Jiaodong and Southern Shandong. A reporter asked why the Third Plenary Session did not issue a decree to suppress the Chinese Communists. Li replied: Although no decree to suppress them has been issued, it is inevitable to operate when the sore is painful. (4) Hebei will not become a decisive battlefield as speculated outside, because the Communist forces are separated by the Yellow River after it returned to its old course. The situation in Shanxi will not be too serious, because the Nationalist forces in Northern Shaanxi are currently pursuing them into Shanxi.</p>
<h3>Restoration of the Pinggu Road</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The damaged roadbeds of the Pinggu Road in Huairou and Miyun have been repaired. Passenger trains were running to Miyun on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng's Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Ministry of Information held a press reception tea party at the Lizi Society at 4 PM on the 9th to welcome the Chinese and foreign press delegation that had just returned from inspecting Yan'an. Minister Peng expressed his condolences and answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Q: What is the latest situation regarding the reorganization of the government? Please explain the reason for the delay.</p>
<p>Peng: The lists of candidates from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party for the National Government Committee have been internally finalized. They will be decided and announced after the Chairman returns to Nanjing. After the establishment of the National Government Committee, the Executive Yuan will be reorganized. Both the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have decided to participate. The Democratic Socialist Party has stated that it can fill two seats as ministers without portfolio in the Executive Yuan, while the Youth Party has stated that it can hold ministerial positions and ministers without portfolio.</p>
<p>Q: It is rumored that the government will establish a News Bureau under the Executive Yuan. What is the situation?</p>
<p>Peng: It has been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council and is currently drafting an organizational law. The principle is to transfer the functions of the original Ministry of Information that should be handled by the government to the News Bureau. The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense may change its name.</p>
<p>Q: What is the recent military situation?</p>
<p>Peng: (1) The Nationalist forces in the Shandong area recovered the historically famous Mount Tai on April 2. The Communist forces retreated into the Xintai and Mengyin mountain areas. They are experiencing a shortage of food and are very distressed. They are currently collecting food from the civilians in Northern Shandong north of the Yellow River and transporting it south to Xinmeng to meet urgent needs. (2) The Nationalist forces in Northern Shaanxi recovered Wabu, north of Yan'an, on April 3. At the same time, the Nationalist forces in Ningxia reached Anbian Fort after recovering Dingbian County. Qingyang and Heshui in Eastern Gansu were also recovered on the 8th. The area occupied by the Communist forces in Western Shaanxi will be cleared in a short period of time. (3) Liu Bocheng's troops in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area once harassed the northernmost tip of Henan. Recently, they were defeated and returned to Daming and Puyang in the southernmost tip of Hebei. In short, the future situation of the Communist forces inside the customs is that they will separately flee into the mountain areas of Shandong and Shanxi, encountering difficulties such as transportation difficulties, food shortages, and a sparse population. It is impossible to sustain it for a long time.</p>
<p>Q: What is your impression of Foreign Minister Molotov's response to Secretary of State Marshall's document?</p>
<p>Peng: Regarding the withdrawal of American troops from China, Marshall has spoken in detail. I deeply admire Foreign Minister Molotov's reiteration of the Soviet Union's policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. China's internal affairs do not allow foreign interference, which is the firm position of the Chinese government. Regarding American aid to China, I would like to point out that the aid provided by the United States to China is for the legitimate government of China and not for armed rebels who are disloyal. Aiding the government of an allied nation is beyond reproach. If American aid were given to the rebel army of China, it would definitely not be justified.</p>
<p>The following are the responses to two foreign affairs questions asked by Chinese and foreign reporters by Ye Gongchao, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:</p>
<p>Q: Please explain the details of the takeover of Dalian and Lushun.</p>
<p>Ye: The government spokesman stated last Wednesday that China had sent the plan for the takeover of Dalian and Lushun to the Soviet government. We are still waiting for the Soviet reply. I have no other news to report before receiving a reply.</p>
<p>Q: What is the situation regarding China's demand for reparations from Japan?</p>
<p>Ye: China agrees with the US government's proposal to advance the dismantling of a portion of the domestic materials in Japan that can be used for reparations. As you all know, China has not demanded any reparations from Germany or Italy. This decision ensures that the percentage of the early payment from Japan received by China will not affect China's future claims in the overall settlement. China hopes that the US government's proposal can be implemented as soon as possible, at least to avoid the erosion and damage of materials. As for the disposal of Japan's overseas assets, if this matter cannot be resolved satisfactorily before the peace conference, it must be decided at the peace conference.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Will Come to Shanghai to Review the Youth Army</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] Luo Zelian, commander of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Suzhou, has recently returned to Suzhou from Nanjing. According to him, after paying respects at his ancestral tombs in Fenghua, Chairman Chiang will review the 202nd Division of the Youth Army in Shanghai before returning to Nanjing. At that time, all troops from Suzhou and Wujin, except those on duty, will be required to go to Shanghai for the review.</p>
<p>[Our Xikou Dispatch, 9th] It has been the eighth day of the Chairman and his wife's return home. After resting and having lunch at the Fenghuangshan Villa on the morning of the 9th, they traveled by car to Shanlin Village, ten li from Xiaowang Temple. This is where the Chiang family first settled. There are now only twenty Chiang households. Chairman Chiang's ancestor, Junming Gong, was buried here. He made a special trip to pay respects and present wreaths. Afterwards, he went to Fachang Temple, more than twenty li from Xikou, to sweep the tomb of his sister, Mrs. Zhu Zhishan, Ruilian. In the evening, he went to Ren Song Village for dinner at the home of Chairman Chiang's aunt, Ruichun. In the evening, he returned to Xikou and watched a Peking Opera at the Military Academy at the invitation of the clan elder, and spent the night at the Fenghuangshan Villa.</p>
<h3>China and Outer Mongolia's National Border Will Soon Be Surveyed and Demarcated</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The work of determining the national border between China and Outer Mongolia will begin soon. Those responsible for this work will be the surveying teams of the Ministry of Interior. The surveying work will begin with ground surveys, conducted in stages and sections. Also, the southern section of the China-Burma border can also be surveyed within the year, after the diplomatic negotiations reach a conclusion. According to Fu Jiao, Director of the Department of Local Administration, the Ministry of Interior is drafting a plan for managing border affairs. The preliminary work will begin with cleaning and managing boundary markers, and a national border police force is planned to be formed.</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Enforces the Order of the Executive Yuan: Protecting Strongholds and Roads; High-Stalk Crops Not Allowed to Be Planted Nearby</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] For the purpose of facilitating the defense and protection of various military strongholds and the safety of railways and highways, the Shandong Provincial Government has received an order from the Executive Yuan that high-stalk crops such as sorghum are not allowed to be planted within ten li on both sides of railways and highways, and two li on both sides of roads in military and political strongholds, counties, and towns. The highway project between Jinan and Jimo has been largely completed. The Shandong Highway Bureau has scheduled a test run next week. The repair of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Xuzhou to Ji'nan has reached Nansha River and Teng County on the 9th, and it is expected to be completed by the end of October this year.</p>
<h3>British Journalists Urge Promoting Sino-British Friendship and Suggesting a Long-Distance Sino-British Flight</h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London, 9th] Renowned British journalist Mr. Samson, who visited China last year, recently wrote a long article in the "Manchester Guardian", urging the UK to strengthen daily relations with its Eastern allies. He said that China and the UK have many common interests, and everything that can enhance cultural and commercial ties between the two countries must be done. Although the UK is currently unable to help with huge sums of money or large quantities of machinery and goods, it must be understood that one or two measures at this time will have a significant impact on Sino-British relations than greater efforts in the future. The UK is still very concerned about the fate of China, so a parliamentary delegation will travel to China this autumn. He suggested a long-distance flight from London to Nanjing, which would not only show respect to China but also make British aircraft famous throughout the world. Mr. Samson also praised the work of the British Council, saying that its activities still need to be carefully expanded. What is most important is to instill in the Chinese practical knowledge that is suitable for the local situation. Regarding the transmission of Chinese news to the UK, he said that the biggest obstacle is the high cost of telegraphs, which is almost twice as high as sending telegrams from the UK. A way should be found to remove "this harmful stumbling block" from Nanjing. As for the commercial issues between the two countries, he said that benefits could be gained if a more detailed exploration of barter trade could be carried out. In view of the importance of the Far East, the British government should appoint a junior minister in the Foreign Office to specialize in Far Eastern affairs.</p>
<h3>The Signing Method of the Common Governance Program Has Been Determined; The Lists of the Two Parties Have Not Been Finalized</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party visited Wang Shijie and Zhang Qun at 7:30 AM on the 9th to discuss the signing method of the common governance program. A final decision has not yet been made. The general approach is to exchange letters. The date of the National Political Conference will be decided after the Chairman returns to Nanjing. Zhang Junmai is also scheduled to arrive in Nanjing at that time to attend. At the same time, the lists of the two parties participating in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will be submitted, and the National Government Committee will be announced. The common governance program will be passed at the first meeting of the newly formed National Government Committee and drafted into law as the sole guideline for the government's governance after the reorganization.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The candidates for the National Government Committee from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have been decided. It is learned that the candidates for ministers without portfolio have also been decided, but the Democratic Socialist Party has decided only to serve as ministers without portfolio and not to participate in ministries. The Youth Party has already been confirmed. Its list of candidates to participate in local governments has also been initially proposed, with ten people being assigned to serve as department heads in various provinces. There are also military personnel who want to participate in military organs. It is said that the government has agreed to the former, while the latter is still under consideration.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Jiang Yuntian told reporters that the government had offered to assign the positions of Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and Minister of Health to members of the Democratic Socialist Party, but Jiang said that the party believes that in order to save national financial expenditures, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should still be merged into the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Health can still operate as the National Health Administration. The Democratic Socialist Party has no intention of participating in the Executive Yuan ministries.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. When asked by reporters what was the reason for the breakdown of negotiations in Nanjing, Zuo said: Although the reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the opening of local governments are difficult, they are not as smooth as imagined; but as far as the Youth Party is concerned, they are not insurmountable. Currently, everything must wait until the Chairman returns to Nanjing before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party Holds a Central Standing Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday to discuss participating in the government in detail, but no conclusion was reached. Wu Xianzi decided not to take up the position of National Government Committee member. Who will replace him has not been decided. It is reported that Zhang Junmai advocated only serving as a minister without portfolio in the Executive Yuan without taking actual responsibility; however, this opinion was strongly opposed by the members of the Standing Committee, who believed it was too impractical. Wu Xianzi has expressed his unwillingness to serve as a National Government Committee member and has advocated not participating in the government; a member of the Standing Committee in Shanghai has sent a letter urging him to come to Shanghai for a discussion to exchange views. Li Daming, a representative from Hong Kong, also flew to Honolulu yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>TASS Fabricates Facts, Ministry of Information Refutes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The spokesman of the Ministry of Information issued a statement at 11 PM on the 9th as follows: The TASS telegram published in the Moscow Pravda on April 7 summarizing the US military aid to China is completely fabricated. The content of the article is too far from the truth, so I think it is only necessary to point out a few major errors, and the rest are not worth arguing. The article stated that after the Japanese surrender, the United States trained and equipped forty divisions of the "Kuomintang Army", which is twice the number of Chinese troops trained and equipped by the United States during the Sino-Japanese War. It also trained and equipped 50,000 "Kuomintang police". The US military advisory group established 27 military schools, and the US separated Qingdao Port from China. Powerful US air force bases were built near major cities. It goes without saying that there is no such thing as a "Kuomintang Army" or "Kuomintang police" in China. The only Chinese political party with a private army is the Chinese Communist Party. During the Anti-Japanese War, the United States assisted China in training 36 divisions, totaling less than 400,000 people, of which 6 divisions were trained in India and fully equipped by the United States, and the remaining 30 divisions were trained in China, partially equipped by the United States, but most of the weapons were made by China itself. The formation of these troops was for the purpose of counterattacking Japan. Some divisions participated in battles in Myanmar and other places. US military equipment was delivered before the Japanese surrender. As a result of the military reorganization, the actual number of these troops is now less than 36 divisions. After the Japanese surrender, no new troops were trained by the United States, no new military academies were established, and no Chinese police were trained by the United States. In Qingdao, the work of Chinese government officials has never been interfered with by foreign countries. There are no US air force bases in China. During the Anti-Japanese War, some airfields were jointly used by China and the United States to fight against Japan. After the Japanese surrender, the United States quickly withdrew from various battlefields, starting with the airfields in the west. A small number of airfields continued to be used by US aircraft to assist China in the repatriation and reception of prisoners. During the Marshall mediation period and after the mediation work stopped, many Communist personnel also benefited from the convenience of US aircraft transport. During the Anti-Japanese War, all measures taken by the United States in China were based on the strategy of the United Nations. At that time and afterward, the actions of the United States did not infringe on China's sovereignty. The report in Pravda completely distorts the facts known to the world.</p>
<h3>Draft Banking Law Initially Reviewed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The draft Banking Law was initially reviewed by the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 9th, chaired by Zhang Zhaoyuan. Dai Mingli, Director of the Department of Finance, Deng Hanliang, Director of the Department of Economy, and Shanghai silver and money industry representatives Shen Rixin, Zhu Xuchang, Zou Rangqing, and Lu Shuliang attended. Shen Rixin and others explained the hopes of the silver and money industry for the law, hoping that the freedom of operation could be increased, government control could be reduced, and put forward other opinions. According to Zhang Zhaoyuan, the drafter, the preliminary review work can be completed on the 10th, and the Finance and Economics Committees will hold a joint meeting on the 12th. The case can be submitted to the next meeting of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>The US Will Not Take Diplomatic Steps Regarding the Tanggu Incident</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] Acting US Secretary of State Acheson spoke at a press conference today about the attack on US Marines stationed in China. He said that the United States does not intend to take any diplomatic steps regarding this case. Acheson said: It cannot be expected that the Chinese government will be responsible for this attack, so the Marines will take appropriate steps on the spot.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 9th] The five US Marines who died in the Communist attack in Xinhe last Saturday are scheduled to be buried at the Tanggu Catholic Church at 6 PM today, with the ceremony presided over by military chaplain Martin. At the same time, the Marine Corps authorities plan to invite reporters to interview the injured American soldiers being treated at the Tianjin hospital soon to report on the incident.</p>
<p>US Commander in China General Gillen passed through this station by special train yesterday afternoon. Those who went to welcome him included Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi, US Marine Corps Commander Howard, etc. It is said that when the US military police were maintaining order, they pushed Mayor Du, and Marine Corps Major Di Ming immediately apologized to Mayor Du verbally. However, some Chinese still expressed their anger. It is reported that trenches will also be dug around the Dongbing Factory, where the Marine Corps is stationed outside Tianjin, and a security line will be set up. Similar security measures have also been decided to be taken near the Xinhe arsenal.</p>
<h3>US Soldier Insults Reporter in Tianjin; Howard Sends Letter of Apology</h3>
<p>And Expresses Punishment for the Offending Military Police</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] When General Gillen passed through Tianjin at noon on the 8th, more than a dozen Tianjin reporters welcomed him at the station. While they were conducting interviews, they were driven away by two US military police. At that time, the US military police not only pushed the reporters with barbaric attitudes but also made insulting remarks. The reporters were insulted for no reason and immediately asked the Foreign Reporters Association to convene an emergency meeting. It was resolved to submit a protest to the US military authorities through the city government. General Howard, the commander of the US military in Tianjin, expressed his apologies for this unfortunate incident. He has sent a letter to the Tianjin municipal government on the 9th to express his apologies to the reporters and stated that the offending military police will be punished to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in the Outskirts of Jinan and the Central Section of Jiaoji Have Been Greatly Reduced; Large-Scale Suppression in the Mountain Areas Is Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] The strength of the Communist forces in the outskirts of Jinan has been greatly reduced. Currently, only the 7th and 11th Divisions of Jie are entrenched near Guodian in the east of the city, and the 6th Brigade of the police near Yucheng in the north of the city are regular troops. The rest are all militia, so people's hearts are stable and the market is gradually becoming prosperous. Especially after the recovery of Tai'an and the opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway front, a large amount of food from Southwestern Shandong is pouring in, and food prices are falling. The price of second-class flour on the 9th has fallen from the past 100,000 to 75,000 per bag. The prices of department stores are also weakening. In addition to being excited, the various circles of the provincial capital have organized a慰勞團 (comfort delegation) to go south to Tai'an to comfort the troops on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] The main force of the Communist forces in Shandong Province is now concentrated in the following two areas: (1) Mount Tai north of Tai'an and Mount Tulai in the southeast and the Lai, Xin, and Meng area, (2) the Yishui and Juxian area. It seems that they are trying to take the opportunity to attack the flanks of the Nationalist forces advancing east and north. In addition to proceeding step by step, Nationalist forces are closely monitoring the Communist forces. The strength of the Communist forces in the central section of Jiaoji has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Nationalist forces have been conducting large-scale suppressions of the five divisions and one independent brigade, totaling 50,000 troops, of the Communist forces, including the New First, New Seventh, New Eighth, Jie Seventh, and Jie Eighth, active in the mountain areas northwest and southwest of Liangqiu and to the north for days. After the Nationalist forces recovered Dashi, Dahuashantou, and Qingshigang, 18 kilometers southwest of Liangqiu, on the 8th, they continued to sweep the areas of Shihuangyu, Sancha River, Hongshanwan, and Qili River.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] Li Wang, the chairman of the Communist Party in Shandong, and Zhang Guangzhong, commander of the Communist Party in Lunan Military Region, held a military meeting at Hongling, 20 kilometers northwest of Liangqiu, on the evening of the 7th, preparing to flee back to the northeastern mountainous area of Feixian County.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] More than 10,000 Communist troops in the mountains of Southern Shandong harassed the Sihuhu and Hanzhuang area in the northern border of Pixian County on the night of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Nationalist forces in Linyi recovered the ancient city, 15 kilometers north of Linyi, at 8 AM on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Battle of Yan'an</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhou</p>
<p>Advancing two to three hundred kilometers in six days, recapturing several major cities, crossing three or four strong defense lines, gaining a foothold in the core of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, which the Communist army had occupied for thirteen years, and continuing to advance—no matter how you look at it, the military achievement is undeniable. The Communist army's military district division in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia consists of four areas: (1) the Yanshu District (i.e., the area surrounding Yan'an), (2) the Anbian District (the area around Jingbian and Yanchi), (3) the Longdong District (belonging to Qingyang, Ningxian, and Heshui), and (4) the Guanzhong District (near Malan). In February of this year, when the peace negotiations were becoming increasingly bleak, the Communist army launched offensives in the Guanzhong and Longdong Districts, disturbing the National army. After the National army was stationed in Heshui, Qingyang, and other places, the Longdong offensive was shattered. After the recapture of Malan, the Guanzhong Military District also completely collapsed. Although the National army suffered losses in these two battles, the Communist army also suffered heavy casualties. In addition to the militia, the 1st Security Brigade, the 1st Training Brigade, and the 2nd Brigade also lost their main forces. Even the Communist army's veteran cadres (units that participated in the Long March), known as the Flying Horse Brigade, the New 4th Brigade, were defeated by the National army. These two battles were the prelude to the Battle of Yan'an. When the CCP "defended Yan'an," these numbered units, due to the loss of their main forces, had reduced combat effectiveness and collapsed within six days, which was one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Among the four military districts of the "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Region," only the Yanshu Military District had the most solid defensive fortifications. For more than ten years, the Communist army had never slackened in its defense projects in Yan'an. The reporter had visited the positions near Chafang in the county and the fortifications in Laushan and Qingliangshan, and they were indeed very solid. The defense equipment against the air force and the army was all available. In particular, the tops of the large and small Laushan mountains mostly had very long tunnels and underground facilities. It is said that when Zhang Xueliang's troops advanced to suppress Yan'an in 1935, two divisions were completely annihilated in the Laushan valley. Now, after more than ten years, it is a fact that it is more resilient and complete than in the past.</p>
<p>The National army began a full-scale attack at dawn on the 14th, advancing in five routes between Luochuan and Yichuan. At that time, the Communist army's plan was not only to stop the National army, but also to eliminate the National army completely outside Yan'an (according to Chen Guodong, deputy commander of the 1st Security Brigade of the Communist army, who was captured by the National army). The Communist army made a big mistake in its strategic assessment of the National army. They thought that the National army would advance steadily from the front, so they had strong equipment on the front. For example, south of Yan'an, they not only buried landmines, but also prepared to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, wanting to trap the National army to death. At the same time, they also felt very strong in the combat effectiveness of the Communist army.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 14, the National army on the left recaptured Jiaodao. After a day of fierce fighting on the 15th, they took Chafang and stopped advancing, only deploying troops on the front. The National army advancing from Yichuan then lightly advanced and attacked Laushan from the side, and detoured towards Yan'an. In this way, the Communist army's plan completely failed. At dawn on the 19th, the First Division, 167th Brigade, under General Li Kungang, captured two hilltops east of Yan'an. At that time, the Communist army held firm on the western hilltops. After the National army's artillery bombardment for four hours, the Communist army could not hold on and retreated. Yan'an, which attracted the world's attention, was lightly recaptured by the National army. Amid the rumbling of artillery fire, the citizens of Yan'an were mobilized by the Communist army to evacuate to the surrounding mountain valleys. Only forty or fifty old, young, disabled people remained in the city.</p>
<p>Ganquan, Yanchang, and Anse were also occupied by the National army in the shortest time. The citizens of Yan'an slowly returned a week later. Street vendors gradually resumed business, and the slogans of the Communist army in the past were brushed over, and new ones were replaced. The "special zone" of the past is normal again today.</p>
<p>In the strategic aspect of the Battle of Yan'an, the Communist army's miscalculation was very great. It still regarded today's National army strategy as the "stupid method" of ten years ago. In the calculation of the Communist army's combat effectiveness, it also almost completely failed. In the documents left by the Communist army in Chafang, they hoped that the defending troops there could resist until March 29 at the shortest. In fact, they only resisted for one day. Similarly, the Communist army had been preparing for many years for the Jinpenwan position on the right wing, and the defending troops were a special service regiment. According to their ideals, this could be defended for at least three or four days, but in fact, they only fought for four or five hours, took seven or eight shells, and ran away.</p>
<p>Most of the people dared to be angry but dared not speak out against the Communist army. The middle and lower-level cadres of the Communist army were also afraid of the National army's excellent weapons. According to a friend, in the Battle of Jinpenwan, after the National army bombarded them with artillery, the Communist army soldiers ignored the orders of their "officers" and collapsed. This episode shows their morale. In Yan'an, I interviewed more than a dozen militiamen who had been captured by the National army. Most of them surrendered with their weapons. They were all sallow, thin, and covered in dust. After eight years of hard struggle against Japan, the general public really had a headache for war. I asked them why they had to fight. Most of them said solemnly: "Who wants to? There's no way." The Battle of Yan'an was not a large-scale main battle, but a success of senior command, saving many lives. Although this is not the death knell of the Communist army, it has its due achievements in the people's faith and the morale of the National army. On the Chafang position, an officer said to me: "The Communist army has no energy and can't take a beating. I feel like they are not as fierce as they were in Jiangxi." (April 5)</p>

<h3>Syngman Rhee Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Says He Will Organize the Government After Returning to Korea Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Tonight to Meet with the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Dr. Syngman Rhee, the Korean revolutionary leader, accompanied by his secretary Zhang Jiyong, arrived in China from the United States on a giant Northwest Airlines plane. He arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 8th and continued west that night, arriving in Shanghai at 4:20 pm yesterday (the 9th). Korean residents and people from all walks of life in the city went to Jiangwan Airport to greet him. Among them were General Lee Qing-cheon, Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Restoration Army, Zai Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the National Diplomacy Association, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, Zhang Bide, Chief of the Protocol Section of the Municipal Government, Gao Lingbai, Official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Jiazhen and Li Luoxia of the Municipal Women's Association, and representatives from about 200 people from 20 organizations including the Sino-Korean Cultural Association, the Korean Overseas Residents Association, the Korean Academy of Classics, the Korean Overseas Patriotic Women's Association, and the Korean Inseong School. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhee is 72 years old, but he is still in good spirits. After getting off the plane, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers. After the Kong Yunqing sisters of the Women's Association presented flowers, Mr. Rhee immediately addressed all the overseas residents, saying: "I am deeply grateful to the overseas compatriots for coming here to welcome me. I have discussed the organization of the government with the US government in the United States, and we have reached an agreement. I will prepare to organize the government when I return home. I am very sympathetic to the hardships of the overseas residents living abroad." Then, after giving instructions to the primary school students of Inseong School, he went straight to Room 401 of the Capital Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhee's Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Rhee met with reporters at the Capital Hotel and made remarks stating: Regarding the organization of the government, he has reached a result with the US government authorities in the United States and has obtained the consent of General Hodge. On the way through Tokyo, he had a long talk with General MacArthur for two hours. MacArthur fully agreed to the two major principles of establishing a Korean provisional government and Koreans governing Korea. After returning to Korea this time, he intends to start organizing the government. As soon as the Korean legislative body passes the election law, universal suffrage will be implemented to establish a democratically elected central government, which should not be too far away. However, the government currently planned to be organized is limited to southern Korea, because the north is currently under the control of the Soviet army. The government we originally hoped to organize included the entire north and south, but General Hodge's intention is to temporarily shelve the north in order to avoid misunderstandings with the Soviet Union. We hope that after the government is established in the south, we can directly negotiate with the Soviet Union to withdraw the Soviet troops and complete the unified government of the north and south.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhee also said: When he was in the United States, he obtained the consent of President Truman to lend 600 million US dollars to the Korean government after the Korean government was established to provide post-disaster and economic assistance. This case will be submitted after the US loans to Greece and Turkey are passed in Congress.</p>
<p>Mission to China</p>
<p>When reporters asked about Mr. Rhee's mission to China, he said: This time there is no secret mission. He only intends to visit Chairman Chiang to enable the two countries to gain a deeper understanding and enhance diplomatic relations. The Korean people are very grateful to Chairman Chiang, especially for Chairman Chiang's assistance to the Korean provisional government, and express their sincere gratitude. The cooperation between China and Korea is of great help to peace in the Far East. I am very sympathetic to Chairman Chiang in dealing with the Communist Party issue, because the current situation in Korea is actually the same as in China.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhee also stated: The national policies currently planned to be implemented after the organization of the government, the first is to obtain cooperation and understanding with the Soviet Union. In addition, it is necessary to open Korean currency exchange and establish diplomatic and economic status.</p>
<p>As for his relationship with Kim Gu, Mr. Rhee said that he and Kim Gu have always maintained a very close relationship in the spirit of cooperation. The Korean people all hope that he and Kim Gu can jointly serve as leaders of Korea.</p>
<p>Going to Nanjing Tonight</p>
<p>Mr. Rhee is scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing tonight to meet with Chairman Chiang and will return to Korea on the 13th of this month. At 7:30 pm yesterday, 21 organizations including the Shanghai Municipal Government Council held a reception for Mr. Rhee on the 18th floor of the International Hotel, attended by more than 30 people including Mayor Wu. At noon today, the Sino-Korean Cultural Association and the National Diplomacy Association jointly held a banquet for Mr. Rhee at the Ze Lou Restaurant. At 4:00 pm, 21 Sino-Korean organizations still hosted a cocktail party at the 14th floor of the International Hotel.</p>

<h3>Receiving Lushun and Dalian Is a Key Issue The Key Lies in Resolving the Illegal Military Forces Whether the Soviet Side Is Sincere Can Be Judged by This</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 9th] Regarding the key issue of receiving Lushun and Dalian, it is known that the issue is still the dissolution of the Communist army and the puppet regime within the Soviet military cordon. According to relevant agencies: this illegal armed force and puppet regime should be disarmed or dismissed by the Soviet army, otherwise the National army must destroy it itself before talking about receiving administrative issues. Because our side, in view of the past reception of Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar, has no guarantee of life and freedom of action, such as the brutal killing of Zhang Xinfu and the forced withdrawal of Songbei reception personnel from the Soviet territory to Shanghai, there is no need to repeat the same mistakes. Whether the Soviet side can handle it according to our wishes can measure whether the Soviet side is sincere in returning Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Autonomy Cadre Training Class, which was established to improve the reception of Lushun and Dalian, is actively training after starting classes on the 7th and will graduate on the 20th. The 160 cadres being trained are all district and Bao chiefs who work locally. In addition, the Lushun and Dalian Reception Personnel Training Class run by the Xingyuan will start on the 14th and will be completed on the 20th. Most of the participants in the training class are senior reception personnel.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Going to Japan for Repatriation The Time Is Not Yet Ripe Japan's Economy Is in Trouble and It Is Not Easy to Do Business</h3>
<p>[This City News] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission said: Overseas Chinese in Japan have repeatedly requested repatriation. Now, we have received definite information from the delegation stationed in Japan that Japan has not yet restored foreign trade, and its domestic economy is in trouble, and it is not easy to do business. Currently, more than 20,000 overseas Chinese in Japan feel it is difficult to make a living. Those who have no job and wander around will be rescued and sent back to China. Therefore, overseas Chinese in both countries should postpone going to Japan for the time being. Moreover, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan stipulates that, except for personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and personnel related to the occupying forces, ordinary foreign people are not allowed to enter the country. Judging from this, the time for overseas Chinese returning to China to go to Japan for repatriation still needs to wait a while.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the regulations for Chinese people going to the United States according to the US immigration law: (1) Those who go to the United States with a tourist visa from the US consulate with an ordinary passport can only stay for one year and are not allowed to be employed in any job; (2) Those who go to the United States with a student visa are also not allowed to be employed. It is hoped that Chinese people going to the United States will pay attention to these regulations.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Salt Continuous Transportation to Movie Tickets 10,000 Tons Planned to Be Sold in Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tainan, 9th] Taiwan salt will continue to be transported to Japan this year. From January to March, ten ships have been loaded with 55,000 tons of salt, exported from Kaohsiung, and transported to Japan, accounting for one-sixth of this year's total exports to Japan. Also, it is learned that about 10,000 tons of Taiwan salt will be transported to the Beijing-Shanghai area for sale in the near future. The required sacks have now been fully transported from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Ship Explosion Case on Guangzhou-Hong Kong Line Cracked Four Bandits Caught in One Net</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] The explosion case of the British-owned Guangdong ship on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong line has been cracked by the police station here. The bandit leader Ye Chou and four bandits have been caught in one net. They confessed that they had used the name of Tongyu Group to extort 10,000 Hong Kong dollars from the Guangdong ship and used a self-made magnetic timed mine to explode the ship on March 22. The "TNT" and Japanese yellow explosives used were left over from his time as the captain of an enemy-killing team in a certain army during the war.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Wu Xue ship on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou line has also received a threatening letter demanding 150,000 Hong Kong dollars. Otherwise, the ship will be exploded when it leaves Hong Kong on the 8th. The Hong Kong authorities informed the Guangzhou police station of this telegram, but the police here had already captured the previous batch of bandits on the evening of the 7th, so the ship did not have an accident.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhiping Invited to Fly to Baguio Sino-Philippine Negotiations to Resume The Philippine Congress Again Proposes Opposition to Our Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 9th] Negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship and General Relations will be formally reopened by Chen Zhiping, our minister to the Philippines, and Quirino, the Philippine vice president and foreign minister, in Baguio. Minister Chen has already taken a special plane to Baguio this morning. The reopening of the negotiations was requested by the Philippine side. Quirino called our embassy yesterday from Baguio, inviting Minister Chen and Sun Biqi, the first secretary, to this summer capital, with the intention of reopening the long-stalled negotiations. Accompanying Mr. Quirino were Foreign Secretary Africa and Assistant Legal Advisor Madaba, who both held important positions in the previous negotiations. Minister Chen will stay there for two days as a guest of Mr. Quirino. Well-informed sources told reporters today that our negotiating representatives will oppose changing the already agreed terms. The reopening of this negotiation may mean that the Philippine Foreign Ministry will withdraw the actions of finally canceling several articles of the draft in February, which caused the negotiations to stall. Also, it is learned that the negotiations on the British-Philippine Commercial Treaty have also encountered difficulties. The Philippines is likely not a good market for British goods.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 9th] Just as the negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship are reopening, another bill opposing our overseas Chinese has been proposed in the Philippine Congress. Sha Tu, chairman of the Philippine Anti-Chinese Alliance, proposed yesterday in the Philippine Senate the Filipinization of the timber business and retail trade, that is, this transaction should be limited to Philippine citizens or companies whose capital is entirely owned by Filipinos. Mr. Sha claimed that the timber industry should be limited to Philippine citizens or companies whose capital is 60% owned by Filipinos in accordance with the Philippine Constitution, but although the Constitution has this provision, the timber retail industry is still controlled by foreigners.</p>
<h3>Chicago Consular Corps Our Consul General Appointed Leader</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] According to diplomatic circles, the leader of the Chicago Consular Corps has been succeeded by Chen Changle, our consul general in Chicago.

<h3>Communist Area Refuses Relief?</h3>
<p>UNRRA CRRRA Supplies Transported to Harbin</p>
<p>Communist Army Does Not Allow Entry into Communist Area</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] Eleven trucks of relief supplies transported by UNRRA and CRRRA to the Songbei Communist area were shipped from Changchun on the 4th. On the same day, they went down to Qijiazi (20 kilometers northwest of Qian Gorlos Mongol Autonomous County) and were rejected by the Communist army on the grounds that they "had not received orders from the Harbin Command." As a result, the entire transport team turned to Dehui, intending to cross the river from Dehui and contact the Communist side again. All the relief supplies were unloaded and stored in Dehui, and after the negotiations were settled, they were reloaded onto trains and transported to Harbin. Currently, eleven empty trucks returned to Changchun from Dehui on the evening of the 8th.</p>

<h3>Korea Must Obtain Independence - Welcome Dr. Syngman Rhee to China</h3>
<p>Korean revolutionary leader Dr. Syngman Rhee arrived in Shanghai yesterday by plane from the United States. The Sino-Korean Cultural Association and the National Diplomacy Association here, as well as various party, government, educational, and other organizations, have prepared a grand welcome to comfort Dr. Rhee from the fatigue of his journey and to strengthen the ties between China and Korea. China and Korea are as close as brothers, and we sincerely welcome Dr. Rhee's long journey, and we wish the doctor good health during his stay in China!</p>
<p>Korea, also known as Joseon, is a large peninsula protruding southeast of the Asian continent, long from north to south, and located between China, the Soviet Union, and Japan. It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the east, the Yellow Sea to the west, the Korea Strait to the south facing Kyushu, Japan, and parts of China, and the Yalu and Tumen Rivers to the north bordering northeastern China and the Soviet Maritime Territory. In terms of national power, it serves as a "land bridge" between the Asian continent and the Japanese archipelago, and in terms of politics, economy, and culture, it has the closest relationship with China. Since its founding, the Korean people have suffered from encirclement and trampling by the Mongols, Manchus, and Japanese, but the Korean people have continued to struggle for independence and freedom. The First Sino-Japanese War from 1894 to 1895 and the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905, although granting independence to the peninsula, gradually increased Japanese influence from then on. For a short period, it was a Japanese protectorate, and in 1910, it was formally incorporated into the Japanese territory. The Korean people, unwilling to be ruled by Japan, launched many uprisings, the most famous of which was the "March 1st Independence Movement" in 1919, also known as the "March 1st Revolution," one of the most heroic revolutionary movements of small and weak nations in Asia. In this movement, Dr. Syngman Rhee provided steadfast leadership. As the revolutionary movement unfolded, Dr. Rhee was supported by the entire Korean people and honorably served as the first president of the Korean Provisional Government, making outstanding contributions. After the failure of the "March 1st Revolution," Dr. Rhee went into exile overseas and continued to lead the independence movement for more than twenty years. His spirit is truly admirable! His ambition is also admirable! This visit by Dr. Rhee to China will not only enhance Sino-Korean relations and the Chinese people's understanding of Korea but will also surely benefit the current changes in the Korean environment, striving for the status that Korea deserves for its freedom and independence.</p>
<p>Korea must be independent, and the Korean people must be free. This is the cry of the Korean people, the cry of the Chinese people, and the cry of the nations participating in the Pan-Asian Conference. The Korean people are a distinct ethnic group in terms of race, and their national life and geography cannot be separated. Their national spirit is firm and unyielding, making them one of the most promising and promising nations for the present and future Asian century. But Korea must be independent and must be free. When the leaders of China, Britain, and the United States met in Cairo in 1943, they clearly declared that they would jointly oppress Japan and demand unconditional surrender, and provide as much assistance as possible to Korea to achieve independence and freedom. This declaration had a tremendous stimulating effect on the revolutionary leaders of Korea in exile overseas, especially the Korean Provisional Government in Chongqing and the Korean expatriates in Britain and the United States. They were excited by the bright future of the revolution and thus worked even harder to assist in the cause of resisting Japanese aggression, in return for the lofty friendship of the United Nations towards them. Unfortunately, when Japan surrendered in 1945 and the United Nations achieved victory, Korean independence was still within sight but out of reach. The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union was intertwined in the Korean issue, and the sorrow of the Korean people's environment is truly sympathetic! Therefore, the cry for Korean independence and freedom is echoing in every corner of Asia.</p>
<p>Today's Korean environment is like this: on the eve of Japan's declaration of unconditional surrender, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and the Red Army quickly moved towards northeastern China and northern Korea; then Japan surrendered, and the US military occupied Seoul, Korea. On September 10 of that year, the US occupying forces established a military government in Seoul. From then on, Korea was invisibly divided into two parts, with the US and Soviet forces occupying the north and south of the peninsula, separated by the 38th parallel. The area occupied by the Soviet army included North Hamgyong Province, South Hamgyong Province, North Pyongan Province, South Pyongan Province, Hwanghae Province (except for a very small southern part), and the northern half of Gangwon Province, totaling 48,487 square miles, accounting for 56.9% of the total area of Korea, with a population of 8,314,000, accounting for 36.5% of the total population of Korea; the area occupied by the US military included South Jeolla Province, North Jeolla Province, South Gyeongsang Province, North Gyeongsang Province, South Chungcheong Province, North Chungcheong Province, Gyeonggi Province, the southern half of Gangwon Province, and a very small southern part of Hwanghae Province, totaling approximately 36,761 square miles, accounting for 43.1% of the total area of Korea, with a population of 14,485,000, accounting for 63.5% of the total population of Korea. In terms of economic value, the US military's occupation area is more significant; in terms of strategic value, the Soviet military's occupation area is more important. The complex contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Korean issue are the misfortune of Korea and the misfortune of the future of peace in the Far East, but the unfortunate development of events was legalized at the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in December of that year. The three countries announced an agreement on the Korean issue, stipulating that the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union would jointly administer Korea for five years. During this period of trusteeship, Korea would be divided into two administrative districts under the US and Soviet Union. Obviously, the conclusion of the agreement seems to be contrary to the spirit of national autonomy, splitting the unity of Korea, delaying the independence of Korea, deepening the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union, and posing a significant threat to northeastern China. Whether in terms of the spirit of the Cairo Declaration, the spirit of the United Nations Charter, or even the future of peace in the Far East, the independence of Korea is inevitable, and the freedom of the Korean people is inevitable. The so-called joint administration and joint trusteeship cannot bring stability and peace to Korea and the Far East; it can only increase the turmoil and crisis in Korea and the Far East. Kim Gu, Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, declared when he left Chongqing to return to Korea: "Korea must not be divided into two. I firmly believe that after the United Nations completes its mission, it will return this political power to the free Koreans. The people of the North and South must unite to make the motherland strong and prosperous again." How meaningful this is.</p>
<p>We, China, are committed to assisting the independence and freedom of small and weak nations. We sympathize with Korea's current situation, oppose the trusteeship of Korea, and consistently place great hope in the unity of the Korean people in the North and South and Korea's early achievement of independence and freedom. At the Pan-Asian Conference, we saw the Korean representative Bae Ke calling on the Allied countries to fulfill their promises and realize Korea's independence as soon as possible. Now, the Korean revolutionary leader Dr. Syngman Rhee, who is in opposition, has come to visit China. In addition to warmly welcoming Dr. Rhee, we also hope that the Korean people will unite and work hard, under the leadership of Dr. Syngman Rhee and other revolutionary leaders, to strive together so that a unified government that truly represents the will of the Korean people can be established as soon as possible and restore strength and prosperity.</p>

<h3>Local Communications</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The temporary consultative assemblies of Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Suqian, Huaiyin, and other counties in northern Jiangsu have successively requested a postponement of conscription to allow the people to rest. According to reliable information from the Northern Jiangsu Garrison Command, northern Jiangsu will focus on organizing Baojia and counting the number of able-bodied men in the first half of this year, and will not conscript soldiers. The conscription period for national standing soldiers will begin in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>The Wudi District Court ruled that the case of the seventeen grain stores, including Mu Du Yan, was insufficient and did not prosecute. The Suzhou County Government considered that the amount of hoarded grain in the case was considerable and that the rice price was tending to rise again. It specially telegraphed to the Wuxi District Office to supervise the grain stores together with the Chamber of Commerce to sell all the hoarded grain at the limited price.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The rice price in this county is rising daily. The reason is that merchants from other places are buying in bulk at high prices and transporting it by train to Zhenjiang for transshipment. Therefore, the price is inevitably higher than the average price. Magistrate Xu, in order to suppress the price in accordance with the provincial order, specially convened an emergency meeting of relevant agencies and organizations yesterday and decided to strictly enforce the regulations.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>The Criminal Police Team of this county arrested two bandits, Yan Lianzi and Zhang Si, who committed a major robbery in Xinzhen, at the railway station on the 6th, and seized a considerable amount of stolen goods, which were all sent to the court for handling.</p>
<p>Haining</p>
<p>The county bank of this county is scheduled to establish its location in Xiaoshi on the 10th. It is decided to set up the Qianhe Street in Xiaoshi Town, and the share capital has been fully collected.</p>
<p>Jinhua</p>
<p>All sectors of this county decided to form the Jinhua Public Utility Cooperative with Limited Liability to take over the operation of the Quanhua Branch of the Eastern Zhejiang Power Plant, which is about to be shut down. It is planned to first raise a capital of 130 million yuan, with 50,000 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Qingpu</p>
<p>Sheshan Mountain in this county is a Catholic holy place with beautiful scenery, attracting many Chinese and foreign tourists. During the Feast of the Assumption next month, Catholics from all over will climb the mountain to pay homage. At that time, there will inevitably be crowded vehicles and horses. The county government has specially submitted a request to the province for materials to carry out large-scale repairs because the bridges and roads of the Songqing Highway Qingshe section, which must be passed to climb the mountain, have been in disrepair for many years.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Quan Yangqing, the district chief of Dongtang District, suddenly committed suicide on the morning of the 7th due to family reasons, stabbing himself twice in the chest. He was seriously injured and was taken to a public hospital for treatment. However, he lost too much blood and has not yet escaped danger.</p>
<p>Hefei</p>
<p>The central government purchased 1.2 million shi of provincial and county-level public grain in Anhui. The provincial consultative assembly sent representatives to Beijing to appeal to the central government and obtained three measures: (1) reduce the purchase of county-level grain by 10,000 shi, (2) each county will deliver grain locally according to the market scale, and (3) the transportation cost will be borne by the central government.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Jiang Heming, a villager of Zhongjie Village (20 li from the city), Changshou, served as the captain of the second squadron of the second battalion of the Zhongjiu Army during the Anti-Japanese War. After retiring, he engaged in business. At the end of last month, five bandits broke into his house, tied Jiang up, and demanded a ransom of 20 million yuan. After eight days, because his wife could not raise the money, he was torn up. His body was found in the Dangjiaqiao River on the 4th. The death was very tragic.</p>

<h3>Molotov Suddenly Agrees to Discuss the Future Boundaries of Germany; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Seems to Have Slightly Improved; Many Believe This Is the Result of Successive Warnings from Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Moscow Radio, 9th: The Four Foreign Ministers will hold a meeting today to discuss two major issues: (1) part of the German-Polish border, and (2) the handling of the Ruhr and Rhineland. Regarding the first issue, Marshall will propose the establishment of a special committee to study the entire German-Polish border issue on the spot. As for the second issue, Marshall will propose that it be handled by the United Nations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 9th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will debate the future borders of defeated Germany today. It is expected that the United States will demand the revision of the western border of Poland, with part of the land returned to Germany. It is reported that the United States has drafted a German-State border plan, which will allow Germany to retain the Ruhr area, assign Upper Silesia to Poland, and allow other European countries to participate in the management of the extremely important economic resources of the two regions. The Soviet Union will oppose this. In addition, the Four Foreign Ministers will also have disputes over France's request for the Ruhr and Rhineland industrial areas. Western diplomats said that today's meeting should clearly show whether Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is willing to work together with US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin to speed up the work of the conference.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 8th] The Soviet Union's insistence on opposing the discussion of the basic issues of the German Peace Treaty has now improved after US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin successively warned Molotov that it would harm the progress of the conference. Marshall requested at today's Four-Power Conference to begin suggestive work and stop arguing with each other, saying: "If we continue to argue and cannot reach an agreement, this conference may not achieve anything." Bevin condemned Molotov's refusal to discuss basic issues, deliberately hindering the progress of the conference. At this point, Molotov suddenly expressed his concession, and the four powers agreed to discuss the future borders of Germany, the Ruhr and Rhineland areas, etc., tomorrow, and scheduled to discuss the procedure for drafting the Peace Treaty on the 10th, and listen to the report of the Adjustment Committee on various disputes on the 11th. Molotov also agreed to send a new representative to participate in the Adjustment Committee or the Foreign Undersecretaries' Conference to carry out the work of the German Peace Treaty. The Soviet Union currently has only one representative, Foreign Undersecretary Vyshinsky, attending the Adjustment Committee and the Foreign Undersecretaries' Conference, so that the two conferences cannot proceed simultaneously, affecting the progress of the work. Molotov first angrily rebuked Britain and the United States at the conference today for refusing to fulfill the Potsdam Agreement on compensation issues and expressed dissatisfaction with the delaying work of the Allied Reparations Committee. Bevin immediately replied that this was due to the failure to obtain information from the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union had not fulfilled its obligations to Western countries in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Today's meeting did not end until Molotov, after being warned by Bevin and Marshall, agreed to schedule a hearing of the Adjustment Committee's report and discuss various basic issues of the German Peace Treaty.</p>
<p>The Conference May Be Extended by Ten Days</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] At the end of today's meeting, when discussing the next agenda, Molotov suggested meeting at 5 or 6 PM on the afternoon of the 9th so that the Adjustment Committee would have time to prepare its report. Bevin protested why the third point on the agenda was not discussed, saying, "This way is really unfair to us." Marshall also insisted on proceeding according to the agenda, saying, "We should not continue to "internally discuss differences." We should clarify the overall situation so as to prepare a better foundation for the next Foreign Ministers' Conference. Marshall's mention of the next Foreign Ministers' Conference indicates that British and American personnel are dissatisfied with this Foreign Ministers' Conference. British and American personnel are very skeptical about whether this conference can reach some agreements, and they even doubt whether a Peace Treaty with Austria can be drafted in the Soviet capital. It is reported that the present conference may be extended for some time. British and American representatives separately purchased return plane tickets for the 13th and 15th several days ago, but now it seems that the conference will be extended by ten days.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers' Representatives Complete Draft of Austrian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th, United Press] Although the four Foreign Ministers' representatives have now completed the work on the Austrian Peace Treaty, US representative Clark said that the prospect of reaching a final agreement is "not very bright." The Soviet Union has made no concessions on the Austrian issue, and the draft Austrian Peace Treaty has been submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] The four Foreign Ministers' representatives have completed the review of the text of the Austrian Peace Treaty today, but have not been able to add the agreed-upon clauses to their report. The report, which was submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 29, shows that of the total of 55 articles in the Austrian Peace Treaty, only 24 have been agreed upon by the four countries.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations Progressing Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th] Regarding the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union to revise the alliance treaty, according to British personnel here, although they had to be temporarily suspended due to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, they have actually made good progress. British and Soviet parties exchanged their drafts a few days ago, and today British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Peterson and Harver will meet with Soviet Foreign Undersecretary Vyshinsky again. Since the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, this is the third meeting between British and Soviet representatives. Once the two sides exchange views on the drafts, it is hoped that all issues related to the alliance treaty can be discussed.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Fetes US, Soviet, and French Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin hosted a banquet at the British Embassy today to entertain the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, US Secretary of State General Marshall, French Foreign Minister and Mrs. Bidault, and Soviet Foreign Undersecretary Vyshinsky all attended.</p>
<h3>Bevin's Foreign Policy May Receive Support from the Labour Party</h3>
<p>Rumours of a Cabinet Reshuffle in Britain</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Authoritative sources here expect the Labour Party to approve Foreign Secretary Bevin's foreign policy at the National Conference to be held on the fortieth day after Easter. Cabinet ministers have recently held frequent debates on foreign policy, and the situation at the meeting shows that most Labour leaders also support it, and 75% of the 300 Labour MPs in the House of Commons also support Bevin and the Cabinet. Related parties believe that the two most noteworthy issues at the Labour Party National Conference will be the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the manpower required for Britain's overseas troops and national defense.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] Rumors are circulating here today that the British Cabinet is about to be reorganized, saying that British Prime Minister Attlee is considering having Foreign Secretary Bevin take charge of the government's planning work to conquer the economic crisis. According to the "Star," which has always expressed goodwill towards the Labour government, Prime Minister Attlee is considering reorganizing the cabinet during his Easter vacation, but the scope of the adjustment will depend on Morrison's health. Morrison is not only the leader of the Labour Party, but also the leader of the government faction in the House of Commons and the Minister of Economic Planning, but is now in France for medical treatment due to illness.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Urges Senate to Pass Aid to Greece and Turkey Act; Indirectly Refutes Soviet Accusations in Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] Republican Senator Vandenberg addressed the Senate as it began debating Truman's Aid to Greece and Turkey Act, calling on the Soviet Union to agree to the principle of "survival and co-existence" to resolve problems in US-Soviet relations. Vandenberg denied that the proposed aid was a new doctrine comparable to the Monroe Doctrine. He also urged the passage of Truman's plan as a precaution to prevent problems before they arise.</p>
<p>He said: "The issue involved in this case is similar to the problems in our country's peace process and the constant friction between Eastern communism and Western democracy. From this issue, various difficulties between the Soviet Union and its vassal states and the United States and other non-communist countries continue to arise. In addition, the phenomenon of hostility towards communist expansion and infiltration is more obvious. At the same time, we often hear the Soviet Union's fear that its neighbors will re-invade. If Moscow really has such fears, it should eliminate them.</p>
<p>All Countries Should Have the Right to Autonomy</p>
<p>We strongly advocate that the United States and other countries should have the right to autonomy, and we also believe that the Soviet Union should have the right to autonomy. If we can respect each other, this kind of fear can be reduced. Vandenberg continued: "We have the right to demand that the Soviet Union prove that it has no intention of surrounding us with the communist world, stop the communist offensive in our country and abroad, and abide by its promise to uphold the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter. What I ask for is not only a verbal statement, but also a factual statement. The greatest need at present is for our two countries to engage in frank discussions, and if possible, we should lay our cards on the table."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered a speech in the Senate today, responding to the accusations made by Soviet representative Gromyko against the United States at the United Nations Security Council yesterday, and requested the Senate to pass military and financial aid to Greece and Turkey to avoid continuous repercussions that would endanger the peace and security of the entire world.</p>
<p>Aiding Greece and Turkey is Necessary</p>
<p>Although he did not mention Gromyko's name in his speech, he said that the $400 million aid plan was by no means "disregarding" the United Nations organization, but rather the greatest act of voluntary loyalty and complete adherence to the United Nations organization. From my point of view, giving the United Nations organization special tasks that it has no intention or is not prepared to undertake is enough to harm it. We should not ignore its joint affairs, but we should not assign it extra joint affairs and thus destroy its effectiveness. Under the current circumstances, Greece will fall into the communist sphere of influence, and there will be continuous and fatal repercussions on both sides. There are two reasons why the United Nations organization cannot handle the Greek and Turkish issues at present. First, the United Nations organization has never intended to become a relief organization in the past or present. Second, the United Nations organization has no military force as its backing. The latter is because the Soviet representative has not allowed this plan to be realized so far. If we pretend that the Greek and Turkish aid plan can be implemented once and for all and other aid can be ended, it is tantamount to deceiving ourselves. The United States' occupation responsibility in Korea will undoubtedly require active support. We must recognize the facts, otherwise, it may cause other situations, and as the shadows lengthen, they will clearly involve our own national happiness.</p>
<h3>Labor and Management Negotiate for Fifteen Hours; Improvement in US Telephone Workers' Strike; Resumption of Work Possible in One or Two Days</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 9th broadcast: US telephone workers and management have made great progress after fifteen hours of continuous negotiations, and work may resume within one or two days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The US government mediator attempted to end the nationwide telephone workers' strike, so on the evening of the 8th, they urged representatives from both labor and management to hold a bargaining conference. However, striking worker representatives stated on the morning of the 9th that there was little hope for an early resolution to the labor dispute. However, Federal Mediation Director Warren stated on the morning of the 9th that efforts to resolve the labor strike were progressing very smoothly. More than 20,000 long-distance telephone workers are the backbone of the strike. It is reported that the ability of automatic telephone workers in major cities to continue working is quite uncertain. The union side stated that if the strike were to be prolonged, these workers would stop working within days. However, Labor Department officials stated that automatic telephone workers could generally continue to work.</p>

<h3>Preparatory Conference of International Trade Organization Opens; US Hopes to Achieve Reciprocal Trade Agreements</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] The preparatory committee of the United Nations International Trade Organization, composed of eighteen countries, will convene in Geneva on April 10th. Acting Secretary of State Acheson expressed confidence in the meeting, stating, "This meeting will be a turning point for world trade and economic prosperity, bringing the world closer to the lasting peace we pray for day and night." Acheson mentioned at a press conference that the head of the US delegation, Director of Economic Affairs Clayton, had already departed for Geneva. Clayton hopes that the Geneva preparatory committee can complete the discussion of the charter of the World Trade Organization as scheduled, so that the results of the discussion can be submitted to the World Trade and Employment Conference to be held in the autumn. He also pointed out that another purpose of the Geneva meeting is to achieve reciprocal trade agreements to reduce barriers to world trade.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Opposes Permanent Stationing of Investigation Team in Greece</h3>

<h3>Reportedly an Agreement Reached Between Britain and the US; British Military Mission to Remain in Greece Pending the End of the Greek Government's Suppression Operations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Authoritative sources: Britain and the US reached an agreement yesterday stipulating that the British army, navy, and air force mission will continue to remain in Greece until the end of the Greek government forces' military operations to suppress the guerrillas. Although the exact duration of the stay is still under discussion between Britain and the US, it is expected that the stay may be longer than the end of the guerrilla suppression work. The purpose of the stay is to assist the US military and economic mission responsible for implementing the Truman Aid Plan to familiarize itself with the situation in Greece. The decision to extend the British mission's stay in Greece is the result of the delayed legislative procedures of the Truman Aid Plan. It is generally believed that the Greek government plans to complete the suppression of the guerrillas and the restoration of order this summer.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] It is reported that British troops stationed in Greece have been actively reduced to 6,000 men in two brigades.</p>
<h3>Greek Government Forces Launch General Offensive Against Guerrillas</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 9th] According to official announcements, Greek government forces launched an offensive against the guerrillas in the provinces of Western Macedonia and Thessaloniki at 5:00 AM today. The army, navy, air force paratroopers, and police are all participating.</p>

<h3>Turkey to Publish White Paper</h3>
<p>Stating Contributions to the United Nations During the War</p>
<p>[United Press, Ankara, 9th] As a result of the Soviet Union's recent attacks on Turkey, claiming that it did not participate in World War II, Turkey will publish a white paper to defend the usefulness of its wartime foreign policy and its contribution to the United Nations' stance. The content of the white paper cannot be known, as officials refuse to disclose it before its publication.</p>
<h3>Wallace Speaks Freely on US-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th broadcast: Wallace delivered an important speech here today, stating briefly, "The next world war will cost the world trillions of dollars, and only a 'super New Deal' that spans the world can save this catastrophe. The US and the Soviet Union are now comparable to two wrestlers, probing each other before making a formal attack. The US and the Soviet Union are also comparable to two fierce dogs, probing each other with their noses before fighting each other. Whether a world war will come again will be clear in the next three months. When the two giants fight, Western Europe will bear the brunt. Currently, the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union are all pursuing their imperialist expansion policies, which will inevitably lead to war unless the US and the Soviet Union reach an understanding. But if the United States does not stop manufacturing atomic bombs, there is absolutely no possibility of obtaining the Soviet Union's understanding.</p>
<h3>US Aircraft Industry Lacks Production Capacity</h3>
<p>Possibly Due to the Sabotage of Communists</p>
<p>[United Press, Wichita, Kansas, 9th] Shaffer, general manager of the Boeing Aircraft Company's Wichita plant, stated today that the production capacity of the US aircraft industry is currently insufficient, possibly due to the sabotage of communist forces within the government. President Truman is now determined to eliminate these forces. The Wichita Boeing Aircraft Plant was originally designed and built at a cost of $48 million. Its equipment for manufacturing B-29 Superfortress aircraft was destroyed by government order within weeks of Japan's surrender in 1945. If the United States had maintained this equipment, its position in the negotiations in Moscow would be much stronger.</p>
<h3>US Coal Miners' Strike; Lewis Becomes More Accommodating</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] US Miners' Union President Lewis sent a letter to the presidents of local branches today, stating: Since the government sent personnel to inspect coal mines across the country, some coal mines have resumed work because the inspection officials declared them safe. He is very pleased with the large output after the resumption of work in these coal mines. Other coal mines should also resume production once government inspection officials prove that their situation complies with safety regulations. Those in the know believe that this letter from Lewis is intended to refute in advance the outside criticism that miners violated the government's ban in November of last year and stopped working. The Federal Court is scheduled to hear the Miners' Union case tomorrow to determine whether the union has complied with the government's order. If Judge Goldsborough's ruling is in favor of the Miners' Union, the union will be able to recover $2.8 million of the $3.5 million in fines previously imposed on it.</p>

<h3>Heard Gromyko Agreed to Strict Control of Atomic Energy; Representatives Investigate the True Meaning of the Soviet Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] According to reliable sources today, Soviet representative Gromyko has stated in a secret meeting of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission working group that he is willing to accept strict supervision and control of atomic energy, from the ore stage to the final step of nuclear fuel. As a result, the report approved by the other ten countries of the Atomic Energy Commission in December of last year has now been accepted by the Soviet Union. The working group decided to continue a detailed review of the Soviet Union's atomic control plan next Monday. There are two key points: (1) An immediate convention should be established to prohibit the use of atomic bombs and stipulate the destruction of existing atomic bombs. (2) Another convention should be signed to establish an international control system and handle it within the scope of the Security Council.</p>
<p>Gromyko's plan is very different from the US Baruch proposal approved by ten countries in June of last year, which assigns all atomic regulations to a control agency to exercise its duties under the supervision of the Security Council, where the five major powers have veto power. The US plan advocates establishing an international atomic development agency with full authority to handle atomic energy in all regions and to swiftly punish those who violate the rules, and the five major powers shall not exercise their veto power on atomic energy issues. It is reported that Gromyko told the representatives that the Soviet Union advocated that all parties unconditionally implement strict supervision and effective control. As for the suggestion in the first report of the Atomic Energy Commission that such supervision include airspace flights, it was rejected. He insisted that the atomic control agency could obtain factory lists from the governments of various countries. The representatives fired a barrage of questions at Gromyko, pursuing the exact meaning of the Soviet plan. According to a well-informed source, US Deputy Representative Osborn questioned Gromyko how he could know how many atomic factories there are without investigation. He felt dissatisfied with Gromyko's response. Finally, Gromyko claimed that this question was not genuinely related to the current discussion and turned to ask Osborn whether the United States opposed the Soviet proposal. The debate ended there, and it is reported that Osborn is prepared to continue questioning him tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Three Major Fires in the City Overnight; Fierce Flames at Maochang Warehouse Not Extinguished; Nearly 100 Billion in Goods Lost; 200 Firefighters Dispatched, Seven Injured; Mayor Wu and Acting Director Yu Personally Arrived to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After an unprecedented fire suddenly broke out at the Maochang Warehouse on Nanzun Road at 0:20 yesterday morning, two more fires occurred in the city in the middle of the night. In addition to the Maochang Warehouse fire, which was the most intense and has been burning for more than 24 hours, with losses of nearly 100 billion, the other two fires, one on Yangshuo Road and one on Huanghe Road, also caused extremely heavy losses. The entire family of six at No. 52, Yangshuo Road, Xin Kaihe, were all buried in the fire pit after a fire broke out at 3:30 AM yesterday. The fire at No. 8, Lane 327, Huanghe Road, also caused extremely large losses.</p>
<p>The fire at the Maochang Company Warehouse on Nanzun Road, after burning for four hours yesterday morning, spread from the second floor to the third floor, and at 4:00 AM, flames burst out of the tough lead roof. At the same time, the part of the warehouse along Qingpu Road was also successively engulfed in the sea of fire, and with the wind adding to the fire's power, it became even more uncontrollable. At about 5:30, the entire lead roof collapsed and collapsed, and in an instant, the flames soared into the sky, and even Pudong and other places several miles away could be clearly seen. Firefighters at the scene did their best to extinguish the fire in order to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby residential buildings (especially the municipal buildings along Daming Road to the west, which were only separated by one lane). At about 8:00, Ren Shuheng, a firefighter from the Hongkou District Fire Brigade, accidentally lost his footing while dodging flying iron sheets and fell from a nearby roof, suffering a serious head injury. At 9:00, Wang Fengbing, Wang Shouxin, and central firefighters Wang Junquan, Tao Chi, Tang Xiqing, and Wang Youshun were successively injured in various parts of their heads, chests, hands, and feet by falling cement tiles and bricks. Although the remaining firefighters were in such a difficult situation, they were still able to stick to their posts, and dozens of nearby municipal buildings were safe. The fire began to slow down after 10:00, but the large amount of cotton, electrical materials from the Telecommunications Bureau, and leftover materials and Western medicines stored by "UNRRA" and "CNRRA" in the north, as well as Maochang Company's own fresh eggs and egg yolks that were about to be shipped abroad, continued to burn until late last night.</p>
<p>When the fire was raging yesterday morning, nearby residents, fearing that they would be affected, moved their important clothes to the sidewalk on the west side of Daming Road for the night. The Hongkou Police Precinct sent a large number of police officers to cut off traffic in the surrounding area from morning to 4:00 PM to provide protection, so the British-owned trams on routes 7, 8, and 10 all stopped running yesterday, and traffic only resumed after 4:00 PM, but pedestrians were still prohibited from passing through.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Acting Director Yu expressed great concern and personally arrived at the fire scene to investigate when the fire was raging yesterday morning, and only left after 6:00. Acting Director Yu also visited the fire scene again at 5:00 PM in the afternoon to give instructions on everything, expressing surprise at the Maochang Warehouse fire and the other two fires that occurred at the same time yesterday morning, saying that it had never happened since he took over the police station.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Zhaoxiang, director of the Fire Department: if there are no accidents, the Maochang fire is expected to be completely extinguished today. The Fire Department dispatched more than 200 firefighters this time, dispatching nearly 20 fire trucks, lighting trucks, etc. Upon hearing the news, the US military fire brigade and the port fire brigade also voluntarily arrived at the scene one after another to assist in the firefighting.</p>

<h3>Nine People Involved in the Warehouse Detained</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Police Precinct detained Maochang Company Deputy Manager Jiang Fuheng, Storage and Transportation Room Director Wang Chengde, and Nanzun Road Warehouse ground floor person in charge Yang Shisheng, second floor person in charge Sheng Jiadong, Telecommunications Bureau staff Song Chunquan, watchmen Jiang Yongyao, Zheng Huazhong, Russian constable Pan Teshi Afu, Fulaike Qu Fu, and other nine people yesterday for investigation.</p>
<p>The first floor of the warehouse was leased by the Ministry of Transportation Telecommunications Bureau, Hongyun Shipping Bureau, and Soviet merchant You Ning Company. The northwest part of the second floor along Nanzun Road was the warehouse of the Ministry of Transportation Telecommunications Bureau and the Meili Foreign Company. The eastern part was stacked with more than 700 large boxes of leftover materials shipped from Okinawa Island by "UNRRA" and Western medicines from "CNRRA". Except for a small part of the third floor where Weihuo Foreign Company stored sundries, the rest was Maochang Company's refrigeration equipment, and chickens and egg yolks that were about to be shipped abroad. Preliminary loss estimates (excluding the ground floor): Maochang Company's refrigeration equipment was 25 billion yuan, the Telecommunications Bureau about 7 billion yuan (one saying about 25 billion), and the loss figures for "UNRRA" and "CNRRA" were probably around 50 billion yuan, so the loss in this fire can be described as an unprecedented disaster in recent decades.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Dead and Injured at Xiaodongmen; Housing and Goods Losses Estimated at 700 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] No. 52, Yangshuo Street, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, is a five-bay three-story house. The lower floor houses the Fengchang North Goods Store and the Dai Xin North Goods Store, and the second and third floors house more than a dozen households and Shen Zhuang. At about 3:30 yesterday morning, Zhang Honghua's family (who opened the Hongwen Shen Zhuang) on the third floor, because they entertained guests the day before for the Qingming Festival, put a coal briquette stove on the third floor corridor. It burned from morning to 11:00 PM before it was extinguished. Because it had been burning for too long, the wooden wall next to the stove was dry and charred. It may have been that a spark fell and burned through the floor, extending to the second floor corridor, which led to a huge fire. At that time, the Yimiao Police Precinct received the report and notified the Fire Department to rush to the rescue. At the time, the residents were all asleep. When they woke up in shock, the fire was already raging. Those who jumped out of windows and jumped from buildings to escape and were injured included Zhang Liantian, Wang Zucheng, Tang Weiqing, Zhao Dingchang, Zhang Yuanguang, Luo Zhongbiao, Zhang Linfeng, Jin Mantang, Zhang Honghua, Shi Huilong, and Liu Gencai. The most tragic was Zhang Honghua's family, as six people were unable to escape and were all burned to death, namely Zhang Cai's wife, Zhang Hong's wife, Liu Zhang's wife, Zhang Libao, Zhang Juxian, and Liu Yuqing. The injured were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the Yimiao Precinct. The charred corpses were sent to the autopsy site. Shen Deheng, Chen Jingshan, Zhou Nan, and Wang Jianxian, section chiefs of the Yimiao Precinct, all came to the fire scene in person to maintain order and investigate the fire, so the surrounding order was good, enabling the firefighters to do their best to extinguish the fire. The fire took three hours to extinguish. Deputy Director Yu of the General Bureau also rushed to urge the extinguishing.</p>
<p>It was found that the No. 52 house was completely destroyed, and together with the two North Goods Stores downstairs, the North-South goods and seafood, and the business assets, the loss was as high as 700 million. Fortunately, the companies had taken out large amounts of fire insurance.</p>

<h3>Huge Losses on Huanghe Road Too</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] No. 8, Lane 327, Huanghe Road, is a five-bay two-story house. The first building is rented to a Chinese and Western Pharmacy as a dormitory. The lower house of the second building is the Lida Screw Factory. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the back room attic, and suddenly the raging fire went straight to the stomach, out of control. The No. 23 floors were rented out to more than 30 households, and men, women, old, and young were all sound asleep. Suddenly hearing the fire alarm, they all fled for their lives. Xin Zha, Central, and other fire departments rushed to the scene with belt vehicles to spray water, but unfortunately the houses were old and the weather was dry. Once the fire reached the top, it spread very quickly, and it took about three hours to extinguish it. As a result, the five-bay two-story house was completely destroyed, and the fire also affected the adjacent No. 6 building.</p>
<h3>Citizens Should Pay Attention to Inspecting Old Electrical Wires</h3>
<p>The continuous fires have caused huge losses. The garrison commander Xuan Tiewu, fearing that it would affect local security, decided to strengthen fire management, launch a building inspection in the short term, and work with the municipal government to launch a city-wide Baojia inspection of old electrical wires in households. The garrison headquarters has also formulated the following matters that should be paid attention to in maintaining electrical wires and avoiding fires: (1) If only the electrical wires are old and the outer wrapping is not broken, there is no risk of electrical leakage causing a fire. (2) If the outer wrapping of the old electrical wires is broken and damaged, the current has no insulation resistance and is extremely prone to electrical leakage causing a fire. (3) If the outer wrapping is broken and the insulation and resistance effect is lost, the electricity will leak from the gaps where there is no wrapping.</p>
<h3>Arsonist Apprehended in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency: A fire broke out in the Dapubiao factory area a month ago, burning for eight hours, destroying factories and causing losses of over 10 billion. At the time, the fire was considered strange, and there seemed to be a smell of sulfur during the burning. It was suspected that it was arson. Yesterday, the local authorities received an urgent telegram from the Capital Garrison Headquarters, saying that the headquarters had captured an arsonist named Zhang Liangrong a week ago. He confessed that he planned to take the opportunity to commit arson in Nanjing to disrupt local order. He also confessed that he caused the fire in the Shanghai factory area a month ago. There are still a large number of bandits hiding in Shanghai, attempting to commit arson and disrupt local security.</p>
<p>It is also learned that when the bandits commit arson, they soak a large amount of cotton cloth in gasoline or kerosene, and then put it in a medium-sized cattail bag or mix it with sulfur gunpowder. When it is dusk or later, they sneak to the factory area, warehouses, and shantytowns, and use fire to ignite the cattail bag. The arson work is carried out by at least three people each time.</p>

He graduated from the Navigation Department of the Naval Thunder and Lightning School, studied torpedo boats in Germany, and graduated from the Royal Naval College in Greenwich, England. He served as the guns officer on the Free China training ship, the captain of the Wen 93 boat of the speedboat brigade of the Jiangfang Command, the captain of the Yue 371 boat, the captains of the Yue 371 and Wen 3 boats of the Guangdong Jiangfang speedboat, and the ship experience of ten years. In 1943, he was sent to England for training and participated in the Normandy landing campaign in France. In 1946, he took over the "Fubo" gunboat, and was appointed as the lieutenant commander of the "Fubo" by the former Military and Political Department of the Navy, and then led the ship back to China from England via the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. In November 1946, the ship's captain Liu Hetu was transferred to the director of the Zuoying Shipyard in Taiwan, and the officer was promoted from lieutenant commander to the original ship's captain."</p>

<p>The distribution of supplies to public and private school personnel in this city has already begun.

<h3>British Company's Tram Contract Decided to be Extended for Seven Years. City Government Notifies Company to Negotiate New Contract.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The exclusive operating contract signed between the British Shanghai Electric Tramways Company and the former Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement will expire on October 10 this year. According to the provisions of the contract, the current municipal government has the right to notify the company of the expiration and termination of the contract and to acquire it at a price six months before the expiration date. After several discussions between Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, as well as the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government Advisory Committee, it was generally agreed that in view of the current position of the municipal government in welcoming foreign investment by the central government, it would be appropriate to allow it to continue operating unless it is necessary. Therefore, the municipal government officially notified the tram company yesterday that it would be allowed to extend its operation for another seven years, until October 9, 1954. However, the municipal government is currently preparing a unified transportation plan for the city, and the company should cooperate with the municipal government in the spirit of Sino-British cooperation to complete this plan and seek its implementation. As for the contract, considering the current environment, many of its provisions are no longer applicable and must be revised and re-signed. In addition, the company's management is not entirely satisfactory, so the company is also ordered to appoint responsible personnel to discuss the revision matters, with the aim of re-signing before October 10 this year. At the same time, management should be improved and equipment should be expanded as much as possible, so that there are sufficient vehicles operating in the urban area to meet public needs.</p>

<h3>Occupied for Thirteen Years, Recovered Only Today, Let's See Such Yan'an.</h3>
<p>The Central Film Studio sent cameraman Shen Weikang to Yan'an to film after the National Army recovered Yan'an. The film has been fully edited and titled "Such Yan'an", and will be shown in the "Xindu", "Dahua" in the capital, and the "Queen" and "Guanghua" cinemas in Shanghai starting today. The content of the film first describes the CCP's lack of sincerity in participating in peace talks, with all liaison personnel withdrawing from Nanjing and Shanghai. It then describes the Communist army launching an offensive in response to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, only to be counterattacked by the National Army. In less than seven days, the army went straight to Yan'an, revealing the face of this small red city that had been occupied by the Communist army for thirteen years. The film provides a systematic dissection and record of the overall appearance of Yan'an, the cave dwellings, the scenery of the Yan River, and the central organs of the CCP. What is intriguing is the magnificent residence of the CCP's top leaders, with actual footage of Mao Zedong's wife, Lan Ping, participating in film work in the past inserted in the middle. The final scene shows the National Army and the local people who have returned from refuge cooperating sincerely to jointly revive northern Shaanxi.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Tongji University in this city launched a strike by all students of the Law School and the Freshmen's College on the 7th to protest the garrison troops forcing their way onto school buses and beating students.

<h3>Husband of Movie Star Wu Guozhang Detained, Stuttering Defense, Denies Supplying Cotton to the Enemy.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Wu Guozhang, the husband of Zhou Manhua, a female movie star from the puppet Huaying company, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning on charges of supplying cotton to the enemy. Wu is 36 years old, from Nanhui, a graduate of Great China University, and lives at No. 11 Renheli, Baike Road, in this city. He opened Yuansheng Flower Factory in Nanhui and served as the manager of Maochang Flower Shop, which was attached to the Maoxin Yarn Factory in Renheli, Xizang Road. In April of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the defendant purchased 200 frames of cotton (i.e., 500 dan) and sold it to the Japanese merchant Yoshida Yoko. Afterwards, there were multiple sales of scattered quantities. After the victory, because there was no transaction, on August 24 of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), Maochang transferred more than 90 million yuan of counterfeit currency from Yoshida's account to Yuansheng's flower fund to close the account. This was discovered by the former Military Statistics Bureau's Shanghai office, which sent a letter to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and filed a public prosecution on suspicion of treason. Wu suffers from a stutter and had difficulty giving his defense in the High Court yesterday. He firmly denied the charge of aiding the enemy, saying that Yoshida Yoko was a purely commercial firm, that brokers connected the buying and selling of goods, and that the delivery location was at Zhajiang near Minhang. He only knew that he was doing business and did not admit to aiding the enemy. After the court hearing, because Wu's case was serious, he was originally released on bail. Yesterday, the court ordered him to be detained in the High Court detention center for further investigation.</p>
<p>[Also News] The case of Wang Yongqing, a secret agent of the Ningfen Police Sub-Bureau of the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, who was accused of treason, was concluded in the High Court yesterday, and the verdict will be announced on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Fortune Teller Speaks in Jargon, Denies Defrauding Money by Relying on Enemy Power.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Fortune teller Chen Kantang set up a fortune-telling stall on Wenjianshi Road, engaging in fortune-telling by face reading, divination, and character breaking. He was accused of taking Sajima, a Japanese-German employee of the puppet municipal police bureau, as his teacher during the puppet period and extorting money by relying on the power of the enemy. After the victory, he was arrested by the police bureau and sent to the High Prosecutor's Office, which filed a public prosecution. Chen defended himself in the High Court yesterday afternoon, claiming that his confession at the North Station Branch of the Police Bureau was obtained under torture and was not credible. He said that he had taken Yishenglei of Hangzhou Chenghuang Mountain as his teacher and had always been engaged in astrology, and had no contact with the enemy. During his response, he spoke in a lot of jargon, including "The body is not difficult to set up a stall, the stall is inseparable from the body, sitting in a shop does not leave the counter, sitting at a stall does not leave the stall." He also said, "My profession does not require capital, only a pen and a mouth, which are inexhaustible, and are varied and fanciful."</p>

<h3>Company Commander's Account of the Incident.</h3>
<p>Also, Wang Hangsong, the company commander of the Seventh Company of the Third Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Automobile Transport Corps, wrote to this newspaper yesterday to describe the incident, stating in brief: "At 7:30 AM on the morning of the 6th, car No. 02706 of this company was ordered to go to Wangjia Wharf to perform transportation duties. The task was completed at 3:00 PM and returned to the company. When driving to the main gate of this Tong and turning right to enter the gate, Tongji University's No. 7 school bus was turning left to exit. The driver of that car did not make a wide turn, causing the front fender of car No. 02706 to be damaged. The driver was responsible for the accident, so he beckoned the school bus to stop for negotiations. Unexpectedly, the car ignored him and drove straight out. At a distance of more than 200 meters from the gate, because the area was the dormitory of Tongji Freshmen's College, the car stopped. The people got on and off. The driver saw that the school bus had stopped, so he turned the car around and chased it to that location to reason with the driver of the school bus. Unexpectedly, it aroused the intervention of the students in the car, who wanted to beat the soldier. The soldier had no choice but to drive the car back to the company. Unexpectedly, the school bus also rushed back to the parking lot of this camp, intending to catch the driver of car No. 02706. While they were arguing, Wang Yunquan, a member of the Student Self-Government Association of Tongji Law School, notified Yao Runyu, the adjutant of this company, to go and mediate. Adjutant Yao rushed to the scene and severely reprimanded the soldiers of this company on the spot and immediately ordered them back to the company. There was no mass fight and no students were injured. Later, a peaceful solution was reached with Wang Guangquan, the responsible representative of the Law School Self-Government Association, and both sides expressed their apologies to each other. In the evening around 7:00 PM, Li, the director of training at Tongji University, came to the company to inquire about the dispute, and the details were also explained, and the misunderstanding between them had been cleared. The facts are as described above. The students of Tongji University suddenly went on strike yesterday, and I don't know what their intentions are."</p>

<h3>Promoting School Construction for Birthday Celebrations; Fundraising Tickets to be Fully Issued Before the End of the Month</h3>

According to the person in charge of the council, the original budget last year was 200 million yuan per school.

<h3>The Chinese Linguistics Society Held its First Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The first board meeting of the Chinese Linguistics Society was held at 3:00 PM yesterday on the fourth floor of the Kaiming Bookstore. Many board members, including Ye Shengtao, Chen Wangdao, Zhou Yutong, Zhang Xichen, and Fang Guangtao, attended. Chen Wangdao was elected as the chairman of the society, Fang Guangtao as the director of the Research Department, and Zhang Xichen as the director of the General Affairs Department. It was also decided to prepare for the establishment of a society venue, enrich the library facilities, and actively promote the work. According to reports, Chen and others had organized the Chinese Language Education Society in 1938, with the aim of studying the Chinese language and improving Chinese language education. The society is now undergoing significant personnel changes, and therefore a separate organization, the Chinese Linguistics Society, was initiated and established on the second of last month, in order to continue studying the basic problems of society. The full text of the society's origin is recorded below:</p>
<p>"The issue of language and writing is a fundamental issue in our social life. We rely on language and writing to conduct social life.</p>
<p>Whether our understanding of language and writing is accurate and whether our handling of it is appropriate often have a significant impact on our social life. If we hope that social life will gradually progress and move towards brightness, we must strive to pursue accuracy and appropriateness.</p>
<p>In modern China, there are many language issues that have not been resolved. Regarding the principles of language, most need to be introduced and clarified. For each issue, there are different views, which need to be discussed and agreed upon to find a common path. The colleagues believe that in addition to our own efforts in research, there is also a need to gather wisdom and explore together. Therefore, this Chinese Linguistics Society is organized in Shanghai, hoping that participating friends will further explore and introduce the principles from the study of practical language problems. We hope that friends with the same aspirations will enthusiastically participate and work together to make our contribution to the language of modern China."</p>

<h3>How to Implement "Educational Travel": This is a Teaching Activity Worth Promoting and Implementing</h3>
<p>— Ma Jingxuan</p>
<p>Spring is here. Spring is the season for educational travel. Teachers in various schools, as usual, lead students to visit parks, temples, mountains, forests, fields, and scenic areas outside the school, in order to expand students' knowledge and increase their knowledge. Therefore, educational travel is also called off-campus teaching.</p>
<p>Recently, when I met with colleagues from various schools, we often talked about the implementation of educational travel. Below is a specific plan that can be used as a reference for schools during implementation.</p>
<p>How to implement educational travel? I believe that the travel destination should first be determined according to the age of the students. If the location is far away, it is not suitable for young students. Secondly, the travel expenses should be determined according to the economic situation of the students' families. If a large amount of travel expenses are required, some students from poor families will be unable to participate.</p>
<p>Once the location is determined and the expenses are low, all students can participate. It is necessary to further formulate a plan for educational travel, such as what preparations should be made in advance? What should be paid attention to when departing? What should be done after returning to school? Then, guide the students to practice one by one.</p>
<p>(A) Preparations before departure: Before the educational travel departs, the following preparations should be made: (1) Items to be prepared: For individuals - bedding (one for every two people), woolen sweaters, cleaning supplies, rain gear, pencils, notebooks, small knives, school badges, extra money, etc. For groups - maps, school photos, school flags, whistles, roll call lists, emergency medicines, collection boxes, account books, travel expenses, etc. (2) Organizations to be established: The entire team should have a general captain to manage roll call and maintain discipline. Each small team should have a small team leader to manage the order of the small team during the visit. In addition, there should be emergency, accounting, and administrative staff to undertake the work that the entire team should do. (3) Matters to be known: You must know the route to and from, you must know the general situation of the destination, you must know the procedures and budget for boat, car, accommodation, and meals.</p>
<p>(B) The following matters should be noted when departing: (1) It is best to wear short clothes and wear a school badge. (2) The following rules should be observed: (1) When walking in a line, walk on the right, pay attention to advancing, stand still and wait for the whistle, (2) Do not approach dangerous places in the boat or car, and obey the orders of the leader, (3) When visiting, do not go outside the designated area, do not take dangerous actions, pay attention to the assembly whistle and location, (4) In the accommodation, do not leave without the teacher's permission, do not rush to drink tea, and do not buy miscellaneous food. (3) Record the experiences along the way, collect specimens of animals, plants, and minerals at any time, and preserve them properly. After a day of visiting, write a letter to report to the parents and organize the notes.</p>
<p>(C) After returning to school, use methods such as reporting, questioning, discussion, writing, painting, and production to correct students' observational errors or supplement their lack of observation. (1) The representative will report the travel process during the commemorative week. (2) Publish travel notes or travelogues in the school magazine or daily newspaper. (3) Draw good landscape paintings in the labor and art class, make collection items, and hold a periodic exhibition of educational travel results. (4) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this trip, (5) Settle the personal and group expenses of this trip.</p>
<p>Educational travel can enable students to learn hardship, endure poverty, cultivate the morality of mutual assistance, promote the spirit of autonomy, and enhance the feelings between teachers and students and the friendship of classmates. Especially after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the development of self-reliance and construction in various places can further encourage students to study hard, move forward, and have the ambition to fly outwards. This is a teaching activity worth promoting and implementing. I hope that school colleagues will not give up this opportunity.</p>

<h3>Sing Tao's Expedition to England; Departs on June 7; Arrives in Shanghai Around April 20</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Air Mail] Sing Tao Football Team's expedition to England is complete. It is reported that Secretary Li Hanjin cannot go due to personal reasons. It is possible that Secretary Su Sha of the General Association will accompany the expedition. Sing Tao plans to go to Shanghai around April 20 for several matches for practice.

<h3>A Record of the Shanghai Hu Xing Ping Pong Team's Southern Expedition; Nine Wins and Two Losses, Excellent Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou Air Mail] The Shanghai Hu Xing Ping Pong Team arrived in Hong Kong on the 18th of last month. Starting on the 20th, the Macau and Guangzhou fans went to Hong Kong to see the team's skills, so the situation was fierce and sensational for a while. Those who came because of the name were extremely crowded.</p>
<p>In Macau</p>
<p>On the 24th, the Shanghai team led the division to Macau. The fans of Guangzhou and Hong Kong teams rushed to Macau, because Macau's ping pong skills have always been above those of Guangzhou and Hong Kong. On the 25th, the Shanghai team first played against the Nanzhong team. The players of the Nanzhong team were assisted by the elite players of the Tao Ying team, with strong strength, including Liang Wenhuan, Hu Jinying, Luo Jinzhen, Lin Jinyuan, and Liang Huantang, all-round elite players. There were many wonderful scenes in the performance of both sides, and the audience was amazed. However, the Nanzhong team's points stopped rising at ten points, and the Shanghai team won in one go, winning 13 to 10. On the 26th, the Shanghai team fought against South China. South China and Nanzhong have similar technologies. Wang Xitian, Lu Nau, Huang Yongnian, Huang Yong'an, and Ma Hanrong are even more skilled in both offense and defense. The Shanghai team was extremely hard to play, and the performance was more interesting than Nanzhong. As a result, 13 to 9, the Shanghai team defeated two heroes in a row. On the 27th, the Macau League General Point Dou defeated Hu Xing. The Governor of Macau personally went to watch the game. The Macau League selected the best players to defend and attack. Starting at 7 pm, a big battle unfolded. The Shanghai stars did not dare to neglect. I don't know how much time it took between each game and each point to end a game. The Shanghai stars' fierce attack, each point could not be resolved without more than 40 shots. Occasionally, the Shanghai stars' offensive was slightly weaker, and the Macau team launched a counterattack. Their bouncing or drawing balls were agile and powerful, often making the Shanghai stars unable to parry. Lu Nau, a general from the Han League team, has always had the reputation of a cannonball, and the performance was excellent. The most lively of the whole team was Wang Xitian, the "Little Overlord". His ability to chop the ball is the champion of Hong Kong and Macau. His killing board and shrinking ball are hard to beat in Sanfu. The counter-draws and bouncing balls of Hu Jinying, and the offense and defense of Luo Jinzhen and Ma Hanrong, all gave the Shanghai team the biggest blow. The two sides fought until 2 am, and the number of games was still twelve to twelve. Finally, Huang Zhijun of Hu Xing and Ma Hanrong of the Macau League played the final. Ma Hanrong made a spurt of energy and won several cities in a row, defeating Huang Zhijun with 21 to 15. After the game, both sides were exhausted and could not afford to speak.</p>
<p>In Guangzhou</p>
<p>On the 29th, the Shanghai Star team went to Guangzhou to compete. Since Guangzhou's restoration, ping pong leadership has not been obtained, so interest is not high. All the generals have never practiced. On that day, they first fought against the Puyou team. Although Puyou had Liang Zhuohui, the former Hong Kong singles champion, Feng Guohao, the team champion, Yu Zumian, the pillar of Macau's Sui Ying, Luo Wenhui, a Tao Ying player, and Zhong Enrong, a famous player in Guangzhou, his strength was originally strong, but he had not had the opportunity to practice for several years, and his skills were unfamiliar, so he lost 2 to 13 to Hu Xing. On the 30th, Qianghua took the field. All the generals of Qianghua are Guangzhou's famous people. Tao Ying's new general Li Huagui was added, which was originally extraordinary, but except for Li Huagui, the rest had been neglecting practice for a long time, and the performance was not wonderful. Only Li Huagui fought bravely and won the most outstanding Wang Youxin and Lu Hanjun of Hu Xing, and only won two points for Qianghua. The result was 13 to 2, and the Shanghai team won. On the 31st, the Puqiang United Team challenged. The United Team had Liang Zhuohui, Fu Zongkun, Yu Zumian, Li Huagui, and Hu Guoliang on the field, but still lost 13 to 2.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Star team finished each game, they took the Guangzhou-Kowloon Express to Hong Kong on the morning of April 1, and then returned to Shanghai by boat. The team was welcomed by Guangzhou Mayor Ouyang Ju. Governor of Macau Wei Yila, Hong Kong Governor Luo Fuguo, etc. (Lei Xuexin sent from Guangzhou)</p>

The export of rice and grain to North China will be prohibited, and senior officials will be dispatched to the market to conduct on-the-ground investigations to ascertain the truth. It is rumored that due to the high price of rice, some rice merchants are selling medium-quality rice as high-quality rice to obtain extra profits.</p>
<p>Northeast Soybeans Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Director Wu of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau told reporters yesterday that, in order to stabilize the price of edible oil in the city, the authorities will supply 8,000 tons of soybeans from the Northeast each month, starting this month. The 8,000 tons of soybeans for this month have already arrived here. Yesterday (the 8th), 1,000 tons were released to be distributed to various oil factories first. The distribution ratio is based on the production volume of each oil factory. Regarding rice, the government currently maintains a reserve of 50,000 tons in the city to regulate surpluses and deficits, so the supply of rice can be guaranteed. The price standards for various major daily necessities will be discussed and determined at the Shanghai Municipal Price Review Committee meeting to be held tomorrow (the 10th).</p>
<p>Oil Prices Continue to Rise by Over 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday, the oil market continued to rise steadily. Raw oil advanced by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan, while refined oil continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil soared by 120,000 yuan, while soybean oil had already reached a fixed price.</p>

Red sorghum followed suit, expected to rise by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans continued to linger in weakness, with a general softening trend.</p>
<p>Raw peanuts saw flat buying interest in the local market, with no significant price changes. Sesame saw lively buying interest from foreign merchants, soaring to new heights, with a firm footing, rising again by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The seventh joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Brokers' Association was held at the Securities Industry Association at about 4:00 PM yesterday.

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Warehouse Inventory; Taiwan Sugar Distribution Suspended This Week</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The relevant authorities are quite concerned about the repeated price increases in the sugar market in recent days. An investigation revealed that sugar merchants have a considerable amount of sugar stored in their warehouses, and there is no shortage. Therefore, it was decided to thoroughly investigate the warehouses. If non-sugar merchants are found to be hoarding sugar, they will be dealt with appropriately. It is also rumored that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has sent a document to Taiwan Sugar Company due to the recent fluctuations in the sugar market, ordering the temporary suspension of sugar distribution for this week. The new distribution method will be decided at the Price Review Committee meeting to be held today.</p>
<h3>Slack Trade in White Coal</h3>

<h3>Stabilizing Prices and Punishing Speculation; Police Bureau Formulates Concrete Measures; To Be Implemented Upon Approval</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in this city] Concrete measures to stabilize prices and punish speculation and manipulation have been formulated by the Economic Section of the Police Bureau and will be formally implemented upon approval. The measures are divided into four categories:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Regulations stipulate that yarn merchants should fill in transaction forms when buying and selling cotton yarn. Non-yarn merchants are not allowed to buy or sell. Purchased cotton yarn must be cleared immediately. Overdue warehouse receipts will be canceled. Warehouse receipts must specify the name of the borrower to prevent hoarding. The Textile Construction Management Committee should do its best to suppress yarn prices and regulate supply and demand.</p>
<p>Rayon</p>
<p>Rayon transactions should be accurately recorded on transaction forms so that rayon customers can verify whether there are private resales into hoarding and black market channels. The China Trust Bureau should have statistics on the supply and sales of rayon and maintain sufficient reserves.</p>
<p>Rice</p>
<p>The Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau bears the heavy responsibility of regulating the city's rice surplus and deficit. Supply and demand should be balanced to stabilize rice prices. Even if there are fluctuations, they should be limited. Amidst today's rising prices, strict investigation of hoarding is necessary to stabilize the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>Personnel will be dispatched to investigate whether sugar companies are colluding with sugar merchants to manipulate grain prices, and to encourage reporting of black market sugar transactions and hoarding.</p>
<p>After Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu announced the day before yesterday that he would assist Mayor Wu in suppressing the city's soaring prices, all staff members of the Economic Group of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command were ordered to be dispatched yesterday morning to monitor transactions in various markets. Zhang Yamin, the head of the group, convened brokers in the yarn and cloth market before the opening of trading and earnestly explained the government's determination to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, urging them to abide by national laws and not engage in manipulation or speculation. He also instructed Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the industry association, to be responsible for suppressing and stabilizing the price of yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Yesterday, under the strict supervision of the military and police authorities, trading in the yarn and cloth market turned weak, and the price drop in the cotton yarn market was even more severe.</p>
<p>Also: The Garrison Command arrested two yarn merchants in the cotton yarn market yesterday for manipulating yarn prices and engaging in black market transactions. As the case involves a wide range of issues, details are not yet available for publication.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, the recent rise in general prices is mostly due to illegal merchants hoarding goods for profit. The situation in the cotton yarn market is very complicated, and black market trading outside the market has a significant impact on market prices. He is personally patrolling today, and any speculative or illegal transactions will be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the Fund Supervisory Standing Committee Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The first standing committee meeting of the 36-year short-term treasury bill and US dollar bond fund supervisory committee was held in the Central Bank's conference room yesterday afternoon. Standing committee members and chairman Li Fusen, standing committee members Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Wu Rencang, and Chen Bingzhang attended. President Zhang of the National Bank and committee members Xu Yongzuo and Ouyang Lun also attended. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. Two main agenda items: (1) Drafting the committee's operating rules, planning to establish the following groups under the committee: (A) Fund Custody Group, (B) Industrial Supervision Group. (2) Drafting a proposal to the government regarding maintaining bond credit. It is rumored that the committee's office will be located in the Bank Association Building on Hong Kong Road in this city.</p>
<h3>Black Market for Newsprint Everywhere; Hope for Relaxation of Import Quotas</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that half of the 3,000-ton newsprint import quota for the newspaper industry in this city between February and April has been approved for import. The remaining half is expected to be approved for import before the end of this month. As for the 4,050-ton import quota for the book industry between February and April, the amount requested by each bookstore is quite fragmented. They are waiting for the bookstores to form a certain tonnage application before the importing firms can place orders on their behalf. It is rumored that Canada, the world's newsprint supplier, is also adopting a distribution system for newsprint to various countries around the world, and there is a fixed quota for our country. The delivery price for this allocated newsprint at the Shanghai port is US$160 per ton. However, the black market price in Shanghai, including tariffs and transportation costs, has reached US$350 per ton. The delivery price for this allocated newsprint in various parts of the United States is US$84 per ton. However, the black market price in the United States has also reached US$200 per ton. The black market price in San Francisco has reached US$225 per ton. If, due to our country's import quota restrictions, the allocated quota of cheap newsprint is transferred to other countries, the result would be a huge loss to our country's economic and cultural circles. Therefore, relevant parties hope that the import control authorities should relax the import quota for this cheap newsprint as much as possible.</p>
<p>[Another Report] In the past week, foreign merchants have initiated the procurement and transportation of newsprint, and prices have gradually risen, with each ream priced at 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. Among foreign merchants, those from the north are the most active, as the northern seaports have only recently thawed. Procurement in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places is also becoming more active. It is also known that a considerable amount of newsprint is transported from Hong Kong to various places via Guangzhou and Hankou. There was a time when newsprint in Hankou was so abundant that prices were lower than in Shanghai, resulting in newsprint being transported from Hankou to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee Discusses Numerous Important Cases</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting at the Central Bank President's Office yesterday afternoon, adjourning at about 7:00 PM.

<h3>Increase of Tea Pledge Loans; Agricultural Bank Began Processing Yesterday; Three-Month Term, 3% Interest</h3>
<p>After the tea purchase method lost its effectiveness, the Central Bank, in order to support tea merchants, negotiated with the Agricultural Bank to allow tea merchants to increase pledge loans and submitted the plan to the Executive Yuan. It is now known that, in response to tea merchants' requests, the bank began processing the loans yesterday (the 9th) before the Executive Yuan approved them. Tea merchants are processing the procedures for increasing pledge loans, applying based on the predetermined quota and 80% of the predetermined pledge price for this year's new tea. The current pledge value of Qi Hong tea at the Agricultural Bank is 480,000 yuan per case, Tun Green 400,000 yuan, and Ping Green 320,000 yuan, with a term of three months and a monthly interest rate of 3%. It is rumored that other places can also apply for similar pledge loans.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to Dai Mingjin, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the China Agricultural Bank, tea loans totaling 13 billion yuan in legal tender were issued last year. Recently, the government, taking into account the actual business difficulties of various tea merchants, has approved an increase in pledge loans, with the Shanghai branch increasing pledge loans by 71 billion yuan. The procedures began yesterday and will be completed in one week. More than 40 tea merchants in Shanghai have been granted loans, including China Jiuxing and Xinghua Tea Companies, which have received larger loan amounts.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Rises; Strong Buying Interest in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bulls in Chinese stocks, led by bond issuers, repeatedly used the tactic of selling and then buying back, making the market struggle fiercely in the morning. In the afternoon, stimulated by the Hong Kong exchange rate, buying interest passively turned strong, and the bulls were successful.</p>
<p>When the market opened in the morning, it showed an upward trend and then a downward trend. Die Yong Yarn opened and fell from an outer market low of 2,810 yuan to 2,760 yuan. Later, it was forced down to 2,730 yuan. Then, No. 94 and others began to buy, and when 2,800 yuan was broken again, sentiment improved. The price rose to 2,860 yuan. Numbers 198, 141, 218 and 202 sold and returned to 2,820 yuan. At this time, Yonggong suddenly had a large number of buyers, with Numbers 89 and 223 making strong purchases, and Dongxing also had scattered buying activity. Both stocks showed considerable profits, and Yonggong once approached the limit up. Sentiment was still easy to stir, and Numbers 85, 196, 152, 35, 89, 145 and 179 were re-absorbed, rising to 2,880 yuan. Number 61 sold strongly at a high price, and Number 223 also supplied, and the afternoon closing fell back to around 2,820 yuan. As a result, Die Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya, Xinguang, Huafeng and Zhongfa fell slightly compared to the previous close. Xinhua fell by half a percent, and Qinxing rose slightly. The delivery exchange showed slight declines in Die Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhuo, Huafeng and Xinguang. Cold stock Yonggong rose to the limit, rising by 10% after a rebound. Matches fell by half a percent, and the remaining stocks showed mixed results.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>Only spot delivery was made. Numbers 137, 13, 76, 198, 83 and 223 all sold and fell to 2,760 yuan. Numbers 94, 198, 14, 89, 145, 185, 99, 231, 223, 28, 232 and 154 bought up. Cement, Yonggong and National Products sequentially rose to the limit. It was reported that the Hong Kong exchange rate had risen, and sentiment suddenly became sensitive. Buying was extremely strong, and the market rose to 2,930 yuan. Numbers 223, 12 and 207 tended to supply at high prices, falling back to 2,890 yuan. However, the bulls repeatedly used the old trick of selling and then buying back, and the market price was still bought up by Numbers 224, 235, 197, 47, 46, 183, 106, 145 and 83 to 2,960 yuan. Underwear also rose to the limit. At the close, Numbers 117 and 61 continued to supply and sell, and the market slightly turned around. The asking prices after the close were slightly flat. As a result, Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya and Xinhua rose slightly compared to the previous close, while Huafeng, Xinguang, Qinxing and Zhongfa each rose by about half a percent. The delivery exchange showed slight declines in all stocks for the half-day trading. Cold stocks showed Yonggong, Underwear, Cement and National Products rising to the limit, Datong rising by 10%, and Commerce and Xinya each rising by slightly more than half a percent to slightly less than 10%. Zhongfang Tongyi rose by half a percent. Rongfeng did not have much trading, only showing flatness. The remaining stocks showed slight gains. Various stocks outside the market were extremely stable, while Zhonghua showed that demand was exceeding supply and prices continued to rise.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Unanimously Cuts Prices</h3>
<p>The foreign tea market, which has long been in a state of fatigue, was unable to rally yesterday because buyers remained sluggish and sellers continued to peddle their goods. Chen Zhong Qimen was absorbed by British Jardine Matheson for over 400 cases at a price of 350,000 to 360,000 yuan per dan, a sharp drop of more than 100,000 yuan compared to last week. The rest were all cut in price. The domestic tea market remained flat, with no changes. However, with the increasing supply of Wenzhou Mingxin and Xin Longjing teas, holders gradually felt unable to support prices, and the price per dan fell back to the 1.2 million yuan mark, a further reduction of 300,000 yuan compared to the initial price. According to industry insiders, new goods from the production areas are still being shipped to Shanghai, and the bottom line is low and precarious.</p>

<h3>Central Cooperative Treasury Shanghai Branch Changes Check Clearing Number; New Number is 50; Effective from the 15th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central Cooperative Treasury was established relatively late, and the check clearing number at that time was 87, which was a check clearing delivery. Recently, it has been deeply felt that check clearing delivery is inconvenient. The Banking and Money Industry Association has agreed to transfer the original number 50 of the clearing house to the branch, and the clearing house will create a special number to promote the branch's participation in direct clearing, which will be implemented on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Pawnshops Request Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In order to adapt to the current environment and assist the government in suppressing usury, the Shanghai Pawnshop Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. According to the resolution of the second member's assembly of the association, it requested the government to provide low-interest loans and discussed the implementation method according to the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau. The directors and supervisors all believed that there were many members in the industry and the situation was quite complicated, so it could not be accomplished overnight. It was resolved to establish a subcommittee to specifically study concrete plans, which would then be submitted to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors for approval and then submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance.</p>

<h3>Advance on Yan'an</h3>
<p>— March 21st, Express News from Xuan Chuan. Our correspondent in Shaanxi, Li Qing</p>
<p>After the Battle of Ma Lan, the strength of both sides on the confrontation line has only increased. This advance on Yan'an is generally regarded as the second act of the former, or the former as the opening prelude to the latter.</p>
<p>On the Communist side, it was reported earlier this month that two to three brigades or more were transferred from western Shanxi across the river, attempting to strengthen the southern line of Yan'an. The famous 358th Brigade and 359th Brigade under He Long are the two brigade numbers that were transferred west to reinforce northern Shaanxi. The deployment of the Communist army, it is said, is to use the Yan'an Defense Regiment, the New Fourth Brigade, the 358th Brigade, and the 359th Brigade as the city defense forces of Yan'an. The Communist forces gathered in the southeast, southwest, and south have also included the Garrison 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Brigades, the New 8th Brigade, the New 9th Brigade, the Teaching 1st Brigade, the Teaching 2nd Brigade, the 27th Division, the 120th Division, and the 6th Cavalry Division. In total, apart from the militia increasing to 100,000, the regular Communist army has reached a maximum of 60,000 to 70,000 troops. This number is at least one-third to one-half more than the week before the war began. In some military strongholds, such as Linzhen Town, Jinpen Bay, and Niuwu Town, the increase is probably one to two times the peacetime level.</p>
<p>From the outbreak of the war to the capture of Yan'an, the focus was on the frontal line of the Yan'an-Luochuan highway and the area east of the highway. The battlefield experienced in the meantime was not as broad as ideal. In short, it was somewhat like an equilateral triangle, with Yan'an as the vertex of the triangle and the connecting line from Luochuan County to Zhujiawan (northwest of Yichuan County) as the base, covering an area of approximately 2,000 square kilometers. However, the area is mostly mountainous, with only sheep gut trails remaining between some highlands, so topographically, it is conducive to the defending side. In terms of terrain, it is also unfavorable to the attacking side, because going north from the Guanzhong Plain to the mountainous area of northern Shaanxi is from low to high, especially north of Yaoxian and Tongchuan. The National Army's risky choice of this difficult area as the main route of march for this advance on Yan'an may have been unforeseen by the CCP leaders. We also remember that certain publications one or two months ago predicted that the route to attack Yan'an would come from the southwest.</p>
<p>The strongholds passed by the National Army before breaking through the pillbox line are roughly as shown in the attached diagram. The first line of important strongholds of the Communist army starts from Fuxian County in the west, passes through Jiaodao Town and Longquan Town in the middle, and reaches Linzhen Town in the west, with a distance of sixty to seventy kilometers in between. Slightly north of this first line are Niuwu Town and Qingquan Town, which are also important strongholds contested by both sides. According to the topography and deployment of the Communist army, the second line of defense of the Communist army seems to be roughly in Ganquan County, north and east of Jinpen Bay, with a distance of less than thirty kilometers. Jinpen Bay is where He Long's headquarters is located. Therefore, it is said that the journey from Xi'an to Yan'an is only from Luochuan to Jinpen Bay.</p>
<p>On the 14th and 15th, the first two days after the war began, the battle situation between the two sides was not very fierce. The first climax was on the third day, the Battle of Jinpen Bay. On the 16th, the National Army recaptured it, and the next day, it captured Ganquan County. At this point, half of the aforementioned equilateral triangle battlefield had been cut off.</p>
<p>The second climax was the Battle of Laushan north of Ganquan. The Communist army used the strategic highlands to concentrate the strength of five brigades (the Independent First Brigade, the Garrison Second Brigade, the Garrison Third Brigade, the New Fourth Brigade, and the New Eighth Brigade), personally commanded by He Long. After several bloody battles, the National Army finally captured several important highlands. Until the afternoon of the 18th, the National Army crossed the mountain ridge, from which it went downhill and directly towards the city of Yan'an.</p>
<p>The advance on Yan'an, which has attracted worldwide attention, had its advance sentries enter at dawn on the 19th, belonging to the First Division under General Luo Lie. (In the Battle of Jinpen Bay, this division made great contributions). Around eight or nine in the morning, the advance troops successively entered. After a small-scale street battle, this Yan'an, known as the "Holy Land of Democracy," no longer saw the red flag with crossed sickle and axe. The battle lasted five days and six nights.</p>
<h3>The Democracy Train has Started (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Guyuan</p>
<p>In precedents of the recall system, if a recall motion is rejected, no further recall motion may be made against the same person sought to be recalled during their current term. The reason for this is to avoid acting on whims and misusing the right to recall, and to allow the person sought to be recalled to perform their duties with peace of mind without fear. However, this design unduly restricts the right to recall, and there is no need to adopt it for representatives of the National Assembly. However, in the case of legislators, because they are constantly involved in political affairs and bear the task of legislation, voters in the original electoral district or unit will certainly hope that they will seek special benefits for a locality or a group. If the legislator has some sense of justice and takes into account the interests of the state, they will inevitably be dissatisfied by the voters in the original electoral district or unit. If there are no remedial provisions, it will be difficult to avoid repeated recall motions from voters in those areas. This threat is too severe! Therefore, the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law stipulates that if a recall motion is rejected, no further recall motion may be made against the same legislator during their original term. The Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law also has similar provisions, namely, if a recall motion is rejected, the original petitioner may not make another recall motion against the same Supervisory Committee member during their original term. The President and Vice President Election and Recall Law still follows this example, stipulating that if a recall motion is rejected, the original petitioner may not make another recall motion against the same President and Vice President. This only means that the original petitioner may not make another motion; others may still make a recall motion in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(6) Establishment and Passage of a Recall Motion</p>
<p>The submission of a recall petition must be signed by a certain number of voters, which is as serious as the signing of a nomination for a candidate. However, too few legally required signatures are not serious enough, and too many are difficult. In the precedents of various countries, the number of signatures required to submit a general recall motion is at most 30% of the voters and at least 5%. When China first implemented the recall system, it goes without saying that the submission of a recall petition must be based on the general practice of requiring a certain percentage of the total number of votes cast when the person was elected in the electoral unit to sign the petition before it can be submitted. However, how is the percentage to be determined so that it is in line with theory and reality? In the recall of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators, the method of "signatures of more than 10% of the voters in the original electoral unit when they were elected" was adopted. For example, when a representative to the National Assembly is elected, even if they are elected with 200,000 votes, if there were 500,000 people who voted in that electoral unit when they were elected, the signatories of the recall petition must be more than 50,000 people. The electoral districts of legislators are larger, and the percentage of people is also relatively large. In the recall of Supervisory Committee members, the method of requiring the joint signatures of more than one-quarter of the total number of voters in each election committee is adopted. For example, if a city council has only sixteen members, at least four councilors must jointly sign to submit a recall petition. In the recall of the President and Vice President, the method of requiring the signatures and seals of more than one-sixth of the total number of representatives of the National Assembly is adopted. If the National Assembly has 2,937 representatives, the recall petition must have at least 489.5 signatures, or to be exact, 490 signatures, before it can be submitted. This type of regulation is nothing more than to make the submission of a recall motion more serious, but the percentage is not necessarily too high, and it is not extremely difficult to submit a recall petition. The submission of a recall petition, in the recall of representatives to the National Assembly or legislators, is submitted to the head of the competent administrative organ of the original electoral unit. The head of the competent administrative organ shall, within thirty days of receiving the petition, verify that the signatures are genuine and that the number of signatories meets the requirements, and shall notify the person sought to be recalled of a copy of the petition, who shall submit a written reply within fifteen days of receipt. Within three days of receiving the written reply, it shall be announced together with the petition, so that voters have a basis for understanding and judging both sides of the recall motion before voting, and then the vote shall be held within thirty days after the announcement. In the recall of Supervisory Committee members, the recall petition is submitted to the speaker of the provincial or municipal council or the head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission or the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The other procedures are the same as the recall of legislators. In the recall of the President and Vice President, the recall petition is sent to the Secretary-General of the National Assembly for announcement. If no one denies the fact of signing within thirty days from the date of announcement, or if there are denials but the number of signatories is still sufficient to meet the one-sixth requirement, the recall motion is established, and the petition is sent to the President of the Legislative Yuan. The President of the Legislative Yuan sends a copy of it to the person sought to be recalled, and convenes a temporary meeting of the National Assembly within one month. After receiving a copy of the petition, the person sought to be recalled submits a written reply to the National Assembly, which is announced by the Secretary-General of the National Assembly. The passage of a recall motion, in the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law, stipulates that the recall motion is passed by a majority of the total number of votes cast when the person was elected, which is extremely fair and reasonable. Because if the calculation is not based on the majority of the total number of votes cast when the person was elected, then if the total number of votes cast in the recall election is extremely small, even if it is calculated by a majority, it is actually a recall motion passed by a very small number of people. Conversely, if we calculate based on the majority of the total number of votes cast when the person was elected, then if the person was elected by a relatively large number of votes, and is recalled by a majority vote, slightly increasing the threshold, it is in line with the principle that recall should be more cautious than election. The provisions of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law do not have the three words "when elected," but there may be supplementary provisions in its implementation regulations. In the Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law, because the Supervisory Committee members are voted on for recall by the councilors of the council, this type of problem does not arise, and only the secret ballot method is used to pass the motion by a majority of the total number of votes cast. In the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law, it is stipulated that the recall motion is passed by a majority of the total number of representatives by secret ballot, which can also be said to be calculated based on the number of votes cast when elected.</p>
<p>After the recall motion is passed, the vacancy of the person recalled is filled by the alternate candidates in the order in the case of National Assembly representatives or legislators. Originally, there are several ways to choose a successor: (1) Hold an election in accordance with the law after the recall motion is passed; this is the fairest and most flawless method, but its disadvantage is that it is cumbersome. (2) The consent to the recall motion and the choice of successor are indicated on the same ballot. All those who support the recall motion simultaneously circle the successor candidate, and if the recall motion is passed, the candidate with the most votes is elected; although this is simpler in procedure, it may not be convenient in China today. (3) The vacancy is filled by appointment; this is a method that violates democracy. (4) The vacancy is left unfilled. This method can be used except in the case of women, when there is no female successor. However, in normal circumstances, if there are too many vacancies and the meeting does not have a quorum, it will constitute a serious situation. (5) The vacancy is filled by alternate candidates in order. Although this method may not avoid the suspicion that alternate candidates deliberately initiate recall motions, in fact, it is not easy to hold by-elections, and the establishment and passage of recall motions are not successful in one fell swoop. Therefore, when China first established the recall system, it had to adopt this method. Conversely, by-elections for Supervisory Committee members are easier, so the successor after the recall of a Supervisory Committee member is not produced by the alternate system, but by election. As for the President being dismissed after being recalled, and the Vice President taking office until the end of the original term of the former President, in another interpretation, it can also be said to be similar to the alternate system.</p>
<p>The above paragraphs are my analysis of the main points of the four election and recall laws.</p>
<p>(7) The New Era of the State</p>
<p>In addition to the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law, the other three election and recall laws have implementation regulations and quota distribution tables for each electoral unit, which are currently under review in the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, there are still many issues regarding elections and recalls, such as election expenses, voting by soldiers and officers, voters and electoral districts, women and electoral districts, false number of signatures, the form of election rights certificates, and all technical issues during implementation, which must be detailed in the implementation regulations. However, the outlines of these four election and recall laws are fully known, allowing the democracy train to start. The election of representatives to the National Assembly, legislators, and Supervisory Committee members will be completed before September of this year, and the election of the President and Vice President will be completed after the National Assembly convenes on December 25, all in accordance with the respective election and recall laws. Talking about democracy on paper is writing on paper. Talking about democracy with one's mouth is a castle in the air. It can also be said that they are blueprints or locomotives that have not left the factory. Having these various election and recall laws promulgated and implemented is tantamount to taking a train out of the factory, placing it on the tracks, lighting the fire, and starting it. This is democracy that is put into practice.</p>
<p>Due to the promulgation of the ten laws related to the Constitution, especially the various election and recall laws, I deeply feel that China is moving in a new direction towards democracy, which is one of the great changes in China's thousands of years of history. Before the Spring and Autumn Period, class distinctions were obvious in the feudal politics of China. The son of a scholar was always a scholar, and the son of a farmer was always a farmer. This was a situation in which noble families held power, and common people could not rise. The situation changed in the Warring States period, when itinerant scholars persuaded various countries, and in the morning they were commoners, and in the evening they were ministers of state. The two Han Dynasties used local recommendations to select scholars, and the Six Dynasties used family status to interfere in politics. The situation was different in each period. The Sui and Tang dynasties emphasized examinations, and scholars were initially unaccustomed to it, and even felt ashamed to submit petitions to recommend themselves. However, as time went on, poor but studious scholars could eventually stand out and discuss state affairs. From the end of the Qing Dynasty to the 30th year of the Republic of China, the practice of recommendation flourished, and the situation was different from before. After the promulgation of the Constitution, the people can now be involved in public affairs, and the way to do so depends entirely on elections, and recalls are used to remedy its shortcomings. This is a brand new system, and it depends on how we adapt to it, how we act in accordance with the various election and recall laws, and thereby exert the power of this democracy train. Advance! Advance! The new era is beginning, the new China is emerging, advance on the road to democracy!</p>

<h3>How to Deal with the Flood of Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>Recently, trains and ships have refused to use the 2-Yuan legal tender notes of 1945, which has led to shops in various places also refusing to use them. The reason for this is probably that too many counterfeit versions of this edition have been produced, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake. If no measures are taken to remedy this, allowing the common people to suffer this innocent loss and affecting the credibility of the legal tender is no small matter. I am writing this letter to appeal, hoping that the authorities will have good methods to deal with this, so that the national economy and the people's livelihood will both benefit. (Wen Mu)</p>
<h3>A Brief Sketch of a Figure in Yan'an: "Labor Hero" Zhang Yongtai</h3>
<p>Zhang Yongtai, the "Labor Hero" of Yan'an, was a former Qing Dynasty scholar, now 68 years old. Since the Communist army settled in Yan'an twelve years ago, all his property, including more than 300 mu of land, more than 600 sheep, more than 60 heads of cattle, three donkeys, one horse, and more than 300 dan of food, were confiscated as "public" property through "struggle". Only more than 30 mu of land were left as Zhang Yongtai's property. Later, under the pressure of coercion, Zhang Yongtai continued to cultivate, and Mao Zedong especially praised him as a "Labor Hero." Zhang Yongtai's grandson, Zhang Dazhong, was coerced by the Communist Party and joined the Party. Taking the opportunity of the National Army's recovery of Yan'an, the grandfather and grandson have surrendered to the National Army authorities. They answered the inquirer's questions in great detail, and their words were filled with grief and indignation!</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Reading Methods</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>The purpose of reading is to seek knowledge, and its ultimate goal is practice. The process of reading should be a dynamic, developing, and practical process of life. That is to say, reading must be for application. Initially, we must learn something from books. Every book is organized. We cannot only understand the details and the meanings of sentences and words, but also grasp a system of thought. The theories presented in books all have a system. Understanding the form without focusing on the substance cannot be considered true understanding. Every book also has a center. Some pages of theoretical expositions can be said to be embellishments, not all of them are the backbone. In addition, it is necessary to understand the narrative method of a book, and see how it is structured and organized. This seems to belong to form, but in fact it is closely related to theory. It has a consistent connection with grasping the system of thought, grasping logic, and grasping the center.</p>
<p>After learning a little concept and knowledge, we must further use our minds. We cannot always accept other people's ideas, but should establish our own ideas. At this time, we must maintain a skeptical attitude. With doubt, we can generate the function of thinking and judgment. Doubt and criticism must pay attention to the facts, and compare what is said in the book with what you have seen, heard, and experienced. Criticism must have a standpoint. Ignoring the essential, individual, and scientific facts, that thought will not be able to stand.</p>
<p>In order to unify and deepen and broaden the acquired knowledge and one's own thinking, it is best to write notes and summaries while reading and thinking. These skills are of great help to scholarship. After reading a book, you may wish to write a book review. If there is nothing to review, it is also okay to extract the main points of the content succinctly. Reading must have insights. At least you have to grasp some important ideas. You cannot have no impression at all and let the concepts and thoughts pass before your eyes. Therefore, reading must have a serious attitude, and you must never be perfunctory and think it's over after one look. Liang Qichao said: "Reading is like attacking a city and seizing land, you must concentrate all your energy on it." I think that the fun and insights of reading can only be obtained and experienced by those who read seriously and conscientiously.</p>
<p>After reading, we should talk about the issue of application. Great Confucian scholars in our country have always advocated the saying that "learning is for application," but few people can understand the true meaning of this. Literally, application may have two interpretations: one is that learning (Chinese people have always regarded doing scholarship as the same thing as reading) is used to help the world and is necessary to solve practical problems; the other is that seeking knowledge is for adapting to the world, and the means of making a living lies in this. Of course, the first interpretation is more correct. However, in today's world, we should not completely regard continued learning as a "preparation" effort, but should make reading related to the entire "life". Reading can expand horizons, fill ideas, transform life experiences, and enhance the meaning of life. Chinese people really do not pay enough attention to the cultivation of reading habits. Except for students, there is no widespread reading atmosphere in society. This is influenced by traditional education. Most people regard reading and application as two separate things. Application begins after preparation is complete (such as students reading in school). There is no need to prepare when applying, so there is no need to read. You only care about preparation when preparing, and you don't have to think about application when reading. In fact, this is a huge misunderstanding. We should consider application when reading. The process of reading should be regarded as the process of the whole life. The application referred to here is not only that you can use the information in the book as a quotation after reading it, but the most important thing is to use it to cope with the dynamic environment of life and solve difficult problems in real life.</p>
<p>In short, the meaning of reading is to apply knowledge to practice, and the reading methods we should adopt must implement this ideal and read books in a dynamic and developing way.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Story of an English Learner in Difficulties"</h3>
<p>— Ren Wen</p>
<p>Written by Fang Dawen, Published by Mingshan Bookstore</p>
<p>At least for the moment, English has become a world language. According to scholars' statistics, the number of people who directly use English in the world is as high as 400 million, and the number of people who are indirectly related to it is even unknown. In terms of language itself, whether English can be improved and become a world language in the future is naturally a matter of much debate and not within our discussion. Today, all levels of schools in the country use English as the first foreign language. The amount of time that every university graduate spends learning English during their studies is staggering, but the number of these people who can really use this language is indeed limited. Therefore, this matter has become a serious problem in education. Is it that the language itself is difficult? Is the teaching method inappropriate? Is the choice of teaching materials inappropriate? Is the learning environment unsuitable? It can be said that these are all reasons. Because of this, those engaged in language education are constantly racking their brains to find ways to remedy it, and the greatest gains in this regard have been the continuous adaptation of teaching materials and the publication of supplementary reading materials. Today, no matter which bookstore we go to, we can see many English reading materials. As far as the author knows, these reading materials have a common shortcoming, that is, they have not escaped from the way of rote knowledge and lack the function of enlightenment. This shortcoming has now been made up for by "The Story of an English Learner in Difficulties."</p>
<p>According to the author's preface, this book is divided into three volumes: elementary, middle, and high school levels. It describes the process of several students learning English in the style of a story. In terms of the story, it takes the process of Lin Yiyi, a student who originally had no interest in English, being influenced by the environment and becoming extremely fond of English, as the warp, and the mutual guidance and research of his classmates and teachers as the weft; in terms of English knowledge, it takes the logical development of grammar as the warp, from shallow to deep, from simple to detailed, and circular and repetitive, like a bamboo shoot, and intersperses it with situational conversations, reading materials, compositions, article analysis, and various methods of learning English, so that people feel like they are reading a novel when reading, without feeling boring.</p>
<p>For teaching reference, I spent a whole afternoon and evening reading fourteen chapters of this book and found that several chapters are particularly worth recommending. For example, Chapter 2, "Stimulated by a Female Classmate," Chapter 5, "The Wall Full of English Words," and Chapter 6, "Little Wind and Sand," all make the most of realistic themes. The richness of its interest makes people unable to put it down until they have finished reading this chapter. The last two chapters synthesize the knowledge of the previous chapters and open a path for beginners of English to continue their studies. Generally speaking, this is a very good English reader; the first characteristic is that it starts from the learner's point of view, not from the teacher's point of view; the second characteristic is that it adopts realistic themes and provides enlightenment at random; the third characteristic is that it guides various learning methods from the story, pays attention to developing habits, and does not have a doctrinaire tone, which makes people feel close after reading it. Speaking of its shortcomings, it is naturally not without them. For example, the materials quoted in the book are Nash's grammar in terms of grammar (although the author particularly emphasizes citing example sentences, which Nash's grammar cannot match), and Fifty Western Anecdotes and Aesop's Fables in terms of reading materials, while articles in recent newspapers and magazines are rarely quoted; in terms of learning, in addition to mentioning a Webster's phonetic symbols and international phonetic symbols, it fails to fully elaborate on pronunciation precautions that can be expressed in words and correction of common mistakes for beginners of English; the ninth child lists as many as 140 correction sentences for nouns and pronouns, and fails to find a way to distribute them in various places, making it seem a bit dull and lengthy to read. In addition, some places seem to have no connection between the story itself and English knowledge, which is also a shortcoming. Even so, for those who are new to English, or those who find it difficult to learn English and lack interest in it, this is a very beneficial book that is worth reading and rereading. If the author thinks that the above criticisms are worth referring to, I hope that he can pay more attention to them when reviewing the middle and lower volumes, and at the same time, I hope that they can be published soon.</p>
<h3>Introducing an Excellent Chemical Reference Book</h3>
<p>— Shen Juecheng</p>
<p>Title: Dictionary of Chemical Drugs Editor: Gao Xian Publisher: Xin Ya Bookstore</p>
<p>Dictionaries are tools for learning. Those who read English cannot do without an English dictionary; those who study chemistry naturally need a chemistry dictionary. However, looking at the publishing world, apart from linguistics, only the Commercial Press published several types of dictionaries of animals and plants in the early years of the Republic of China. Regarding chemistry, there is silence. Even if you search for a makeshift, you can only find a few small booklets and compilations, which can only be called vocabulary. The reason for this is, as the editor himself stated: "The creation of a dictionary is not an easy task." Chemistry dictionaries are especially complex. Chemistry deals with the study of matter; where does matter exist? If it does not belong to animals and plants, it must enter minerals. Therefore, speaking of chemistry must involve animals, plants, and minerals; in other words, it must involve the study of natural history. There is no doubt that chemistry dictionaries must involve animals, plants, and minerals. Just speaking of chemistry, there are thousands of things, which are already diverse and varied, and naming them is not easy. Adding natural history terms is like adding flowers to embroidery.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, there is still a chemistry dictionary that is difficult to appear, but today one has been published. However, this is a dictionary of chemical drugs related to chemistry, not a chemistry dictionary. Therefore, many terms, methods, and historical figures related to chemistry are not mentioned. Although it is suspected of being biased, in China's barren cultural world, it can already be called an extremely good tool for chemistry.</p>
<p>Calling it extremely good is not to praise the editor or to promote the bookstore. It is only because the publishing world today is subject to various fetters and difficulties, and is already on its last breath. What we see are just some small books. This kind of giant work is almost impossible to publish. Even if there are one or two, they are not this kind of rigid scientific book. It is worthy of praise that Xin Ya Bookstore was able to publish it resolutely at this time. The publishing world is lonely, and writers are naturally depressed; at this time, no one will make such an attempt. We can see the date recorded on the preface to see the editor's starting date, which is almost ten years ago, and the so-called date of going to press is also four years ago, so it is naturally inevitable that it is not perfect. Many of the names used are based on the existing ones, and it seems inevitable that they will be inherited. However, the editor said in his preface: "A name is the guest of reality. The only worry is that it is uncertain and has no system. The debate about good and bad is secondary." Therefore, the names of animals, plants, and minerals; chemical and medical names are all inherited from the existing ones, nothing more than to make them commonly used. This book is based on the English version. All places that are not reached by the original book have been corrected. Now I will list its advantages here.</p>
<p>(1) The search is extensive. As long as we count the number of pages and the number of lines in the English index attached at the end, we can know that about 10,000 terms are listed. Those with different names for the same thing should have been detailed. In addition to what was originally listed in the book, the work of supplementing and compiling it seems not easy, but it is also valuable.</p>
<p>(2) The content is substantial. In addition to the above-mentioned English terms, the editor has also widely searched and listed Chinese names. And the molecular formula, molecular weight, or atomic number, atomic weight, and atomic valence are added. In theory, these are all important items. In addition to the properties and constants, there are two items for the method of manufacture: origin and refining. In addition to the use, there are also grades and packaging to clarify the actual situation of the product, which is naturally practical for the project. There is also a special article on fires and explosions. These are essential knowledge for storage and transportation, and are very important in practical use. There is also a point that can be mentioned, that is, various constant tables are attached at the end, which are indispensable for practical use. After the editor's supplement, it is even more complete.</p>
<p>(3) The naming is uniform. The editor adopts an attitude of describing but not creating for many terms, so each term has a basis. Many common names and other names are not abandoned, and are listed below, and special articles are established for each to allow for easy checking.</p>
<p>(4) The arrangement is clear. The main name is listed first according to the stroke count. If there are other names or common names, they are added in parentheses and listed after them. The English name is then attached in parentheses, and if there is more than one name, they are separated by ";". The explanatory text is divided into multiple items, the first is the chemical formula, and the second is the properties, constants... uses, etc. are all distinguished by heavy square brackets, so the outline is extremely clear.</p>
<p>Based on these points, I said earlier that it is an extremely good tool for harm. The editor hopes that the aftercomers will make it even better in his preface. Then the editor certainly does not think that it is extremely good, and hopes that this so-called extremely good can pass with the times and be replaced by the so-called extremely good in the future. Then, for the sake of the culture and academics of the motherland, I hope that the trend will continue, and not be like the dictionaries of botany and zoology, which have not changed a word for decades, and that no second type will appear for decades, becoming the only treasure in chemistry in our country.</p>
<p>Now I will introduce the author. The author, Gao Xianjun, is engaged in chemical engineering. His achievements are as described in Zhang's preface. In his spare time, he also engages in writing. His works were mostly published by the Commercial Press in the past, so he is not an unfamiliar figure in the engineering world and the writing world. Then this book is also not an unfamiliar text for the reader.</p>
<h3>"History and Geography of the Soviet Union"</h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>One of the Rejuvenation Series • Written by Wu Qingyou • Published by the Commercial Press</p>
<p>Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, in his book "Mission to Moscow," expressed the following sentiments about the Soviet Union: "The Soviet Union is a large country, occupying one-sixth of the world's land area and home to approximately one-tenth of the world's population. God has blessed them with abundant natural resources – minerals, agriculture, fisheries, and forests – and a great, capable, and strong people. The Soviet Union's potential matches its demonstrated achievements, and it is destined to become one of the world's greatest powers."</p>
<p>The current world is divided into two types: capitalism, represented by countries like the United States and Britain, and socialism, represented by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Many young people are already quite clear about the formation of capitalist countries like Britain and the United States, but few are aware of the formation of the socialist state of the Soviet Union. However, given current trends, understanding the Soviet Union is essential.</p>
<p>Previously, this publication introduced several books on studying the Soviet Union, but because these were research-oriented, they were not suitable for young readers, as young people must first have an understanding before embarking on research. The book "History and Geography of the Soviet Union" that I am now introducing can be said to be the only book for understanding the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Within this book, young people are told about the historical development of the Soviet Union, the reasons for the creation of its socialist state, and a clear explanation of all aspects of the Soviet Union is provided. Every piece of writing is worth reading.</p>
<p>The contents of this book are as follows:</p>
<p>It first explains the Soviet Union's topography and boundaries, mountains and rivers, and its climate and products. Next, it discusses the Soviet Union's ethnicities and population, geographical conditions, and the distribution of Soviet production. The above covers the geographical aspects of the Soviet Union, and the descriptions are very detailed.</p>
<p>Then, it discusses: Russia in ancient and medieval times, the rise and fall of the Russian Empire, the October Revolution and the birth of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union during the Five-Year Plan period. Finally, it discusses the Soviet Union during wartime. This historical section is even more detailed and accurate than the geographical section.</p>
<p>In addition to this, this book also discusses the Soviet Union's economy, culture, and future trends.</p>
<p>This book can be said to be an overview of the Soviet Union. Although some parts are still brief, it is very suitable for general readers to read. After reading it, you will definitely have a considerable understanding of the Soviet Union, and then you can further research the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>After reading this book, if you want to have a deeper understanding of the Soviet Union, we can also look at the following books: (1) "The Soviet Union Today" – written by Wu Qingyou, Reading Edition, (2) "Mission to Moscow" – written by Davies, also available in translation, (3) "Return from the Soviet Union" – written by Shao Lizi, published by the China Cultural Service Society. After reading all these books, I can confidently say that you will have a very deep understanding of the Soviet Union. As for books on researching the Soviet Union, there are truly too many to list here.</p>
<p>In short, understanding the Soviet Union is essential for young people today, and "History and Geography of the Soviet Union" is the basic text for understanding the Soviet Union. Reading it can increase our knowledge – understanding the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>News from the Publishing World</h3>
<p>The educational books published by Wentong Bookstore include "Cultivation of the Mind," a book on self-cultivation that educators must read. The first edition sold out quickly upon publication. It is now known that the bookstore has already released a second edition to thank readers who love this book.</p>
<h3>Arc de Triomphe</h3>
<p>— Written by Remarque • Translated by Zhu Baoguang • Published by the Zhongwai Publishing House</p>
<p>Previously, the literary supplement of the Zhengyan Daily had published a lengthy serialization of Remarque's novel "Arc de Triomphe," translated by Mr. Zhu Wen, which attracted the attention of general readers at the time. Unfortunately, for some reason, it was suddenly discontinued halfway through and not completed. Recently, in a bookstore, I happened to find a Chinese translation of "Arc de Triomphe," signed by the translator Zhu Baoguang. The writing style is also quite elegant, but unfortunately, it is only translated from an abridged version of the original book, and we have not yet been able to see the whole picture.</p>
<p>"Arc de Triomphe" is a work completed in 1945 by Remarque (Erich Maria Remarque), a famous anti-war and anti-Nazi writer. After the publication of this novel, it caused a sensation in the reading world and became one of the best-selling books in the United States last spring.</p>
<p>The story is as follows:</p>
<p>Ravic, a German surgeon, was expelled by the Nazi Party after 1938 and wandered to Paris. He lives in an old small hotel, in front of which is a square. At night, there are scattered lights. In the foggy rainy season, the tomb of the Unknown Soldier lying under the memorial stone tower often appears even more gloomy and melancholy, and the magnificent Arc de Triomphe is not far from here.</p>
<p>Ravic has no passport in Paris. In order to pay for room and board, he has to work as an assistant for a French doctor with less-than-stellar skills. The life of a refugee is dim and lonely. When he is bored, he can only stay in the underground dining hall of the hotel to smoke or chat with some wanderers. A Russian man named "Morosow" is Ravic's good friend; he is a doorman at a nightclub.</p>
<p>One night, on his way home, Ravic encountered a woman near the Arc de Triomphe. She seemed to have suffered a major shock, was not very clear-headed, and was extremely tired, swaying as if about to fall. He quickly helped her and took her to a small tavern to rest, and they drank some wine together. Afterwards, he placed this homeless woman in the hotel—Ravic did this entirely out of pity, without any ulterior motives. This young woman is called Madou Roang, an Italian singer wandering here, lonely and nameless, but she has a strangely beautiful head of hair and elegant manners. She wears a finely tailored blue dress.</p>
<p>Later, through Ravic's introduction, Roang sings in the nightclub guarded by Morosow. There is a Gypsy band, the lights are very soft, and Ravic often spends a lot of time here. He begins to find that Roang has a mysterious face, full of confusion and charm, which he had never seen before. Once, late at night after the nightclub closed, they drank Calvados again—the same drink they had in the small tavern when they first met. When Roang's hand was placed on Ravic's body, warmth passed through his clothes and reached his heart. He felt intimacy, and his heart gradually changed from emptiness to fullness. They fell in love with each other.</p>
<p>Soon, Ravic and Roang spent eight quiet and comfortable days in the beautiful Riviera, the cost of which was Ravic's newly received consultation fee. They were so happy in this new place. Under the moonlight, their dark figures were shattered by each other's footsteps, they drank delicious sparkling wine, and spoke countless incomprehensible words. The joy of those eight days exceeded what they had experienced in the previous eight years, but it was as short as eight minutes. In the blink of an eye, everything was over.</p>
<p>Ravic returned to Paris and encountered an unexpected misfortune. He was arrested by the police and, because he was found without a passport, he was banished to the Swiss border, spending three months there. When he was released and returned, Roang had already moved in with another man. He felt angry and bitter, although Roang still expressed her love for him and wanted to return to his side, he completely refused. At this moment, Ravic met the terrible Nazi agent—Hake—in the hotel. Hake came from Berlin. He was treacherous and fierce, and had killed countless people. Ravic's former lover was poisoned to death by him. This time, he was unwilling to let go of this opportunity easily. He used great wisdom and courage to murder Hake and bury his body in the bushes of the wilderness, without leaving a trace. Only then did Ravic feel the pleasure and relief of revenge.</p>
<p>Finally, Roang was also shot. It was too late for Ravic to treat her; he could not save her. The woman he had cared for and loved finally lay in his arms, tightly closing her lips. The last sound from those lips would forever ripple in Ravic's ears; she had said to him: "I love you"!</p>
<p>On this very night, the German army began to invade Poland. France was immersed in an atmosphere of panic and tension. Ravic took his suitcase and a blanket, followed the police, and jumped into a truck. The truck drove through the Arc de Triomphe. The square was completely dark. They couldn't even see the huge, gray shadow stretching into the clouds—the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>"Arc de Triomphe" is a great novel that expresses human love and hate. The author lets us see a true picture in his creation. We cannot forget how the refugee under Nazi violence struggled towards a difficult situation with eager desire. Ravic is a "heart." He needs the rights of a free man. He needs the nourishment of warmth. He loves and is loved. He is also despised. He also retaliates against those who despise him. He finally killed Hake, one of the many enemies. He has endured these bitter and cold days. What exactly does he rely on? What kind of strange power is supporting him? Remarque tells us here: because Ravic always tightly embraces one thing—that is, his faith.</p>
<p>With amazing writing skills and delicate psychological descriptions, the success of this novel is undeniable. In addition to Remarque's great contribution in consciousness, his writing is also very fascinating. The dialogue and narration contain many epigrams, beautiful and profound, often causing people to think deeply after reading, and then read again. For example, when Roang returns to Ravic, he refuses her and says: "Roang, don't be with me. A person cannot lock up the wind, nor can he lock up the water. If he locks them up, the wind and water will decay. The wind that is confined will become corrupt air. You have come and cannot stay in any place for long." He also said: "Doctors are like women, we monitor death, you monitor love. All the reasons in the world are in this matter."</p>
<p>Remarque is a German who participated in the First World War, was wounded five times. After the war, he worked as a teacher, stonemason, motor vehicle inspector for a car company, and assistant editor for a certain pictorial. In 1929, he wrote a world-shattering novel "All Quiet on the Western Front," which was initially rejected by one publisher, but later reluctantly accepted by another. In the first year of its publication, it sold 1.2 million copies in Germany alone and was translated into 29 languages. Since the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, his books have been banned, and his German citizenship has been revoked. In 1939, he came to the United States and has now applied for U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>In addition to "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Arc de Triomphe," Remarque's works also include "The Road Back," "Three Comrades," and "Flotsam."</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: Recently, we received a letter from Mr. Zhu Wen, informing us that the translation of this book, which he previously published in installments in the Zhengyan Daily, has now been completed and is being typeset by the Cultural Life Publishing House, scheduled for publication at the end of May. According to this, it can be known that there are already two Chinese translations of this book.)</p>

<h3>"Life is Meaningless"?</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>A young man in Beiping, feeling that life was meaningless, committed suicide at the Beijing Hotel on the first of this month. Before his death, he played the song "The Wind of May." (See the Beiping telegram in this newspaper on the 4th) This kind of death belongs to another side, that is, it does not belong to the general suicides caused by economic oppression or unrequited love and unemployment.</p>
<p>For a person to explore the problem of life, especially to pursue it to the problems that belong to the category of philosophy of life, it can really be said to be asking for trouble. Life is life, just as a dog is a dog, and a tree is a tree. If we were to ask why we were born to be human, and why being human means eating, defecating, walking, and sleeping like this, then for this major question, we really have an endless number of answers. Moreover, it's better not to ask or answer. Once we ask and answer, the problem becomes more and more complicated, and the more we say, the more confused we become. In the end, we become inexplicable.</p>
<p>I say this not to tell people to live like zombies, muddling through one day at a time. It is unnecessary for a person to think too far ahead and try to understand the mysteries of life, but it is also wrong to live in a daze. A more moderate view of life in between is to give oneself a place in life. I am studying now, so I must understand my lessons clearly; I am working, so I should complete this work thoroughly; as a clerk, I must fulfill my responsibilities meticulously. In short, today's life is about completing the work that I should do today. As for what benefits this work has for society and life, why am I doing this, and what does it mean to do it... it is best not to think about such thoughts that are far from reality. "Only hear the plowing, not the harvest," this is not to say that we ignore the purpose, but that the purpose is actually in the plowing itself.</p>
<p>Many people are too calculating about utilitarianism. Whenever they feel that their work will not help the future, they are unwilling to spend time now. In this way, they often leave their time empty. It doesn't matter if it's empty, but because of the emptiness, many irrelevant associations arise. So they feel that there is nothing to do, and what they can do has no meaning. I believe that this young man who committed suicide must have had too much free time, allowing him to imagine a mysterious problem of life in this free time. Unfortunately, he was ultimately swallowed up by this vast problem and it devoured his real life. Otherwise, if he were as busy as a farmer who goes out early and returns late or a rickshaw driver who runs all day long, how could he have time to think about this pitiful problem? Naturally, he would not commit suicide. Life is inherently without incident; fools disturb themselves! Those who do not grasp reality and only circle around those unrealistic problems, you say they are clever for a lifetime, but in fact, they are confused for a lifetime!</p>
<p>However, having said that, if reality could satisfy people more, then young people might not think about those unattainable problems at all!</p>
<h3>Normal School Movement Week: The Drums Are Not Loud</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Today, talking about "the Way of the Teacher" is generally considered pedantic and a step backward. Fashionable people will not listen. However, everyone clearly understands that the next generation of the nation inherits this generation of the nation, and their hopes for them are very sincere and infinite. However, how to educate them and cultivate them into knowledgeable and capable mainstays so that they can shoulder the important task of inheriting the previous generation of the nation, then, those who bear the responsibility of education are extremely important! The government has emphasized this point, launched the "Normal School Education" Movement Week, aroused the people of the country to advocate normal school education, improve the status of teachers, and encourage normal school students, making educators, who have always had bitter faces, reveal a moment of a smile. – Just a moment of a smile!</p>
<p>Every movement, at the beginning, only makes opening drums, and rarely has a successful ending. Other movements are like this, how can this "Normal School" movement escape this category? Moreover, during this movement, the drums are not loud, so it is easily forgotten. Those adults, bald heads, will not be interested; university professors are clamoring for subsidies; the lives of primary and secondary school teachers, especially, are arduous and struggling; those normal school students, not caring about the ridicule of their classmates, bury their heads in their studies. Because, the future of those who study normal school has long been destined. It seems that studying general subjects has a future, and they can go to higher schools for further studies, so they are proud and despise those who study normal school. Normal school students hold the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?", the belief of "Education Saves the Nation", which is really admirable; unfortunately, graduation means unemployment, although there are many who have the ambition to dedicate themselves to education, this wish is often not realized. Given an opportunity, they all changed their professions. Otherwise, they can only be frustrated and despondent all day long. Who else pays attention to them? The past sorrow of normal school students is like this, what dare the future ask for?</p>
<h3>Random Chat</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>"Adding flowers to embroidery" is not as good as "sending charcoal in the snow," because adding flowers to embroidery is not very necessary. But how much warmth is needed in the cold!</p>
<p>I especially love the lonely feeling of upwardness, so I like to approach the old nobles who have fallen into the rivers and lakes and the powdered skulls of the red powder legends.</p>
<p>Because the friendship in the wind and dust will be more lovely than the innocent innocence.</p>
<p>The middle age in the wind and dust is the second nine years of life in the crucial point. Women are like peaches and plums, valued in color; women in the wind and dust are like plum blossoms, valued in breath.</p>
<p>Emotions that have been through the sea are not easy to move. If they move, they cannot be suppressed.</p>
<p>Compared to the ladies who are "everyone's wife," the women in the wind and dust are worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Someone said: "Time and space are a function of emotion." Obviously, I don't like this sentence very much. I don't believe that all old friends are good friends.</p>
<p>Wang Bo said: "A bosom friend afar brings a distant land near." This experience is worth cherishing.</p>
<p>The Buddhist said, meeting is complete, emphasizing the word "complete". Therefore, people's acquaintance does not necessarily require an interview. Wang Shixian visited Dai Andao, and returned without entering his door. He explained to himself: "I went for fun and returned with satisfaction; why bother to see Dai?" Yuan Zhong's spirit of expressing himself as much as possible in front of a good friend is much better than the general Jin people's hypocritical talks.</p>
<p>Didn't Dante instantly confirm the love he was forever attached to when he was nine years old? Wasn't this entanglement sublimated into the brilliant classic of poetry—"The Divine Comedy"? Who dares to deny that this is the most beautiful emotion?</p>
<h3>On the Obstinacy of Gangyi</h3>
<p>— Mu Tao</p>
<p>Gangyi was one of the culprits of the Gengzi Incident, and also the worst example of adulating and welcoming the imperial edict. He came from a translator's degree (this specifically refers to translating Manchu text, there was such a subject in the Qing Dynasty, not translating the languages of various countries). Although he was not completely ignorant, his absurdity in writing and his confusion in views were rare even among the Manchu officials. However, he was appointed as the governor and entered the Grand Council. The Eastern Dynasty used this kind of person, it is really what is called Zheng Wu as the prime minister, the current affairs can be known.</p>
<p>After the Jiawu-Yihai War of Guangxu and before the Gengzi Incident, the Western Palace became increasingly water and fire, and those attached to Cixi and those attached to Emperor Dezong each established a party, and Gang was the mainstay of the Cixi party. Therefore, he always said to people: Our emperor must learn from Emperor Shun, satirizing Guangxu's unfilial piety to cater to Cixi. When he was the Minister of the Ministry of Punishment, on the day of his appointment, he gathered the officials and said: We, as officials of the Ministry of Punishment, must learn from Gao Tao (that is, continue like the original character said Tao). The position of the Xingcao's position (the position of Xingcao is Manchu for what he is responsible for) is not held by Han Chinese unless they have two rankings, or they must have a formal background. Hearing this, they all couldn't help but cover their mouths and smile. When he was the Governor of Jiangsu, he styled himself as Shi Shilun (Shi Gong in the old drama), and used Long Dianyang as Huang Tianba, even expressing it in his memorials. Therefore, Weng Songchan made a quatrain: "The emperor descends to the king in great surprise, Gao Yao covers his ears and fears hearing his name. Now there is Huang Tianba again, who is the Sai Erdun of the year." Gang knew this and hated Weng to the bone. Weng was Emperor Dezong's teacher and naturally belonged to the Dezong party. Gang, in front of Cixi, reported his shortcomings (Gang made friends with Li Lianying very closely), which led to the dismissal of the Wuxu coup, and even handed him over to the local officials for strict control, and used his donated patriotism of 50,000 gold to enter the embezzlement library, how could he not humiliate him with all kinds of embarrassment? In fact, Gang was a translator's degree, and Weng was actually the examiner, and they had a teacher-student friendship, but he bit back like this, his person is really a scoundrel. The late father entered the Grand Council in Yihai and was in the same rank with him for four years, and told us: When Gang read Jin Wu Liu Ding's memorial, he always read Ding as "cai", and Weng told him: This character is not pronounced as "cai", Gang retorted Weng: Why is the Ding character in Sun Jian's name pronounced as "nai"? His obstinacy and incomprehension were like this. No wonder he flattered Cixi, trusted the Boxers, brought disaster to the country, and died with a broken reputation without repentance.</p>
<h3>Remembering Old Events</h3>
<p>— Zhou Tingwu</p>
<p>The late Qing Sheng (Gongbao) Xuanhuai Shi, when he traveled east to inspect factories and mines, met with Ito Hirobumi. He eagerly said: The two countries of China and Japan should carefully maintain friendship and never allow external insults to take advantage of internal friction. If there is any change, Japan, fearing the cold of lips and teeth, can hardly stand by and watch? Your Excellency has been an old friend for twenty years, so I do not hesitate to confide my true feelings, and I have eight words to offer: "Take care of the overall situation and do not dispute small things." This should be pleasing to your Excellency. I don't know that those who took office later were arrogant and domineering, treating China as a forbidden area, and eventually ran into a wall. According to their generation's reversal of words, it is appropriate to have this retribution.</p>
<p>New Knowledge</p>
<h3>Sound Movie Mobile House</h3>
<p>— Jun Xuan</p>
<p>Recently, I visited a sound projector that was shipped to China for the first time, and I feel that it can be used as a tool to promote electrified education, so I would like to introduce it:</p>
<p>The body is quite large, quite like a square cabin, with four wheels underneath, which is very easy to push. The inside of the machine is pitch black, and the sound projector film, amplifier, and all the mechanical parts are installed in it. The screen is a square beryllium glass, installed on the upper section of the front of the machine. From the outside, it looks like a radio receiver for wireless image transmission.</p>
<p>After turning on the power, the indicator light emits a red light, and then pressing the start button, the movie will move on the glass screen. The picture of the film is reflected from the outside of the machine, and at the same time, the amplifier also plays the recordings on the soundtrack.</p>
<p>Its newest feature is that it can automatically, continuously, repeatedly, and cyclically play each 400-foot film, four films, or a 1,600-foot film. In addition, once it is installed and started, it will take care of itself. Even if there is any obstacle in the machine—such as the film being interrupted, too tight, or too wide—it will automatically stop and cut off the power.</p>
<p>The installation procedure is very simple: (1) Wind the film to be circulated into a specially made disc; (2) A total of six or eight feet of film is drawn from the inner and outer rings of this disk; (3) Glue the drawn film, that is, the beginning and end of the film, together; (4) After a few "rollers" and lenses, the inner film is exactly connected to the outer periphery of the film. The reason why it can be played continuously and repeatedly is due to the clever mechanical design of the glued film start and end.</p>
<p>Educational textbook films are mostly 400 feet per film. By gluing four films (that is, four topics) together, they can be played for 40 minutes. If it is played for four hours every night, it can automatically circulate six times. If each audience is 100 people, then 600 people can be taught every night, and 20,000 people will gain academic knowledge due to the movie every month. From the perspective of popularizing mass education, it is indeed a noteworthy tool.</p>

<p>The Wanye Bookstore has recently published two new books, one old and one new. The first is a six-act historical drama, "Lang Tao Sha" (Waves Wash the Sand), compiled by Shu Yan. It depicts the historical facts of the corrupt political situation at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the vigorous revolutionary movement. The scenes are complex and the writing is fluent. The second is Mei Linpu's "Respect for the Elderly Society," a collection of short stories reflecting various aspects of reality during the war. The writing style is pungent and the character portrayals are vivid.</p>
<p>Shi Zhengcun is currently planning to write thirty short stories reflecting the various aspects of the Great Rear Area during the Anti-Japanese War. When completed, the book will be titled "Yu Zhan" (With the Plank Road).</p>
<p>Xiong Foxi will lead the [unclear text] School's [unclear text] to Hangzhou for a performance later this month, and is expected to return to Shanghai in early next month.</p>
<h3>Money · Wealth</h3>
<p>— A Lin</p>
<p>Before his death, Chichikov's father left his son not a fortune, but a saying that he would benefit from for the rest of his life: "The most trustworthy thing is money."</p>
<p>Standing in front of life, money is indeed the best [unclear text]. It can make a person jump from a thirteenth-rank civil official to a first or second-rank civil official. It can also make Yan Huagui's group favor you regardless of your background. In the countryside, there is a market in the middle of the day where goods can be exchanged. In the city, if you don't have it, you will feel that the world is so big that there is no place for you. Money is a [unclear text] beam between you and life.</p>
<p>Therefore, the more fully one lives, the more one loves the importance of money. Therefore, the more one is involved with money, the more one finds it lovable. This is why there are tigers in Jinhu, and why senior officials in the Central Bank use their positions to purchase gold.</p>
<p>A poet once described money as an immoral bacterium. In fact, it is better to compare it to yeast, which ferments a person's desires without end. The origin of wealth is worth studying. Originally, human beings either worked or competed. As time has passed to this day, it is still the same. The competition for more or less in the exchange is an example. The speculation of gold and all goods is not actually a plunder of the common people? Honest labor will not increase wealth a thousandfold in five minutes. To get rich, one must be violent. Only improper behavior is allowed here. Therefore, today, a legitimate businessman often does not operate, not because he does not want to operate, but because he feels that such operation is unreasonable and unbearable.</p>
<p>One wave of gold rush made many people thin and hungry, but how many people actually became rich in this opportunity? Although it is said that there will be investigations and handling, such as the Central Bank's gold discount officials, it is only a matter of dismissal. The money that comes [unclear text] is still in their own pockets. Locking the stable door after the horse is stolen is already too late.</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Is there a solution? Aili, let me tell you, when the country is in trouble and there is no solution, no matter how resourceful an individual is, there will be no solution!" Suddenly he realized that these words were like playing the lute to a cow when speaking to Jin Aili, so he immediately changed his tone. "In short, Aili, don't compare me to Xu the Fat or the Zhus! They are gods and generals, I am a little ghost! What solution do you think I have?"</p>
<p>Jin Aili chuckled.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at?" Old Zhu said solemnly, "Even you are much better than me now! You are a fairy! Aren't you leaving tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Then, do you want me to help them?" Old Zhu's words, when Jin Aili heard them, were 100% flattery, which made her even happier.</p>
<p>Old Zhu hesitated for a moment. He knew that at least in these few days, Jin Aili was a treasure of the Zhus. If she said a few words, it might be effective. However, he knew Lan's personality too well. She would not easily ask for help from him, how would she be willing to see Jin Aili and the Zhu's assistant's faces?</p>
<p>"Okay! But I have to ask them myself!" He wiped his lips with his hand, "If [unclear text] really can't get on the train, I will definitely come and hit you. I know where the Zhu's live."</p>
<p>Jin Aili looked at him meaningfully.</p>
<p>"However you want me to [unclear text], I will do so [unclear text]." She said gently.</p>
<p>"Okay, thank you, Aili." Old Zhu also seemed very happy. He stood up and paid the bill first, not giving Aili a chance to fight him.</p>
<p>When he was about to go out, she enthusiastically grabbed Old Zhu's hand again and asked diligently:</p>
<p>"When are you planning to leave yourself?"</p>
<p>Old Zhu knew her heart very well, and at the same time, he was very clear about the goodwill she had for him.</p>
<p>"You go first!" Old Zhu said as if comforting a child, "When I get to Guiyang, I will definitely come and hit you!"</p>
<p>After he put her on the car, he strode off, looking towards the Art Museum. The situation that day was indeed particularly tense. Lu Qian, Zhang Chang and that group of people all lost their original composure. Everyone was showing a very flustered look, urging Old Zhu to quickly decide whether to leave, when to leave, and the principles of how to leave. From morning on, Old Zhu [unclear text] was busy for most of the day; holding meetings, making phone calls, looking for people, preparing [unclear text], until about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, he finally had some clue.</p>
<p>He lay diagonally on a dilapidated rattan chair, ate three or four peanut candies in a row, and was planning to take a little rest. Suddenly, a thought flashed into his mind. "Ah!" he exclaimed in shock. (39)</p>
