<h3>主席親主持國務會議　總預算案重付審查　郵電加價維持原議送立院完成程序　增加鹽稅明年元旦實行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕國務會議廿六日例會中，曾討論要案七件，茲誌案由如次：　卅七年度中央政府上牛年預算，決重付審査。　文武職人員待遇調整計劃委會研究要點，決議重付審查。　全國鹽稅增加，自明年一月一日實施。　海關設臨時附加稅實施辦法通過。　郵電加價之職權案，決議仍按原議送立法院。　選舉補充條例案，按原審査意見通過。　請增設滿族立·監委名額事，決議通過。計立委十五人，監委八人，惟尙待審査，並經立法程序後始可施行</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕中央政府卅七年度上半年總預算，主管方面提出後，國務會議以該預算收支差額甚鉅，未予通過，當決定與此案同時提出之公務人員待遇案一併交付由五院院長·主計長·財長暨府委王雲五，余家菊·戢翼翹·翁文灝·陳輝德等組成之特種審査委員會再加審査。廿六日會議中，主計長徐堪·財長兪鴻鈞·行政院長張羣·副院長王雲五等，對以上兩案曾就編列經過發表長篇報吿，會議一度暫行休息，若干委員認爲當前國家財政困難，預算收支應力求平衡，開源節流，截員簡政，始爲勵精圖冶之根本辦法。蔣主席今日親臨主特國務會議，並對國家預算問題有所指示。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕卅七年度中央政府上半年之預算，共計九十萬二千二百六十四億五四九萬，較之卅六年度全年度全國總預算增加二借，該案決重付審査。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕聞卅七年上半年國家總預算，其最大特點爲設費，諸如交部，資委會等經費，較前增加若干，並主根據憲法·將敎育·科學·文化預算增至總額百至十五，至公務負薪津則因尙未決定，將列入第二預備金項下。至收入部門，主耍聞仍將爲稅收，國營事業收益，日賠償物資及債務等。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕公教人員待遇調整問題，廿六日國務會議中提出討論，經過兩小時之縝密研討，猶未獲得結論，當討論至中途時，蔣主席並退至另一室內，當即交特種委員會審查。五等詳商後，再行與會討論，但終以問題牽涉太廣，一時未能決定，當即交特種委員會審査。據今日提會討論這，係由主計處組織之文武職人員待遇調整計劃委會所研究之要點，會中徐堪，　鴻鈞等之發言，均表示國府負擔過重，有若干人士則為：過去所辦公教人員之配給事宜，未免流於偏頗，不能普遍。又聞徐傳　在會中談話時，曾認爲與其嫌預算大，不如裁撤駢枝機構，減少元員，一面發給相當數量之遣散費，俾使在職者薪津可以充裕發給，惟此項談話唯在表示渠之意見而已，未有何種具體建議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕政府對進口物資之徵稅，已決在海關設臨時附加稅，自卅七年元旦起，暫征半年，增百分之五十，惟其中棉花·米·麵粉·麥·煤係已定官價者，不在此例，其次汽油·柴油·煤油亦已增加進口稅，不在此例，其餘各進口物資，均得征收。又郵電加價事，再提出於國務會議，當經決議在此動員戡亂期間，國務會議爲國家最高權力機關，有權作權宜之處理，不必先經立法院，並由行政院補送立院，完成立法程序。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕全國鹽稅增加案，已於廿六日國務會議中通過，計決定自卅七年度元旦起實施，普通食鹽每担增至廿五萬元，土膏漁晨鹽各增至廿萬元。</p>

<h3>向仁愛與民主前進！　——讀敎宗庇護十二世廣播詞的感想——</h3>
<p>敎宗庇護十二世於聖誕前夕，向全世界四萬萬天主敎信衆廣播：在其演辭中，對目前中國之處境，表示深刻之關心。我們如今還沒有機會讀到敎宗廣播的全文，但從報紙上所刋載的一鱗半爪，已不難窺見全文的一般精神。這精神就是指示着人類，應該向仁愛與民主前進。是的，我們須以仁愛克服仇恨，以民主克服極權。</p>
<p>本來，敎宗在每年聖誕節，例有廣播，除了天主敎敎友及歐美各國外，我們原不會加以一般的注意。我們旣非一個基督敎的國家，更非一個天主敎的國家，敎宗的演說，雖是一篇四平八穩，面面俱到，含義甚深的文章，但在一般人看來，好像總有點和我們痛癢無關。這原是極自然的，但今年敎宗的演辭，旣直接提到中國，且就現有的種種跡象，我們也實在不能像從前那樣存着漠不關心的態度。在某督敎以內，雖則有所謂天主敎和耶穌敎之分，在耶穌敎內又有各種會派，但無論信奉耶穌敎也好，信奉天主敎也好，他們同爲信奉耶穌基督的基督敎信衆則一。羅馬敎宗爲全世界四萬萬天主敎信衆所共奉的精神領袖，雖耶穌敎各派對羅馬敎宗的態度不同，然以天主敎信衆之多，歷史之長，羅馬敎宗在實際上無寗說是現在基督敎的一個最高領袖。這是因爲他是基督敎內最崇高的領袖，所以他的一言一行，均爲世界所關注，到了現在就是連我們中國也不應忽視了。</p>
<p>爲什麼呢？在目前的世界大勢下，我們已可顯然地看出基督與反基督的鬥爭。我們前天於憲政的光榮開始時著論，曾說：我們肝衡世界大局，如果世界眞有分裂，則此一分裂，決不是東方與西方的分裂，而將是基督敎與反基督敎世界的分裂。反某督敎的勢力也許能稱覇一時，然其結果，却沒有不失敗的。其原因就是基督敎的勢力代表民主，而反基督敎的勢力則象徵極權。在這樣一種世界局勢下，賴我主席的英明領導，我們已可看出此後我們應該行進的方向。這方向是什麼？就是向基督敎世界行進，也就是向民主自由前進，而反對極權專制。在主席於行憲前夕向全國人民廣播的演辭內，已經明晰地指出：「我們新憲法的特點就是它保證要把某督敎理的基本要素，卽個人的尊嚴與自由，普遍給予我們全國的同胞」。這部具有基督敎理成分的憲法施行，又在「中華民國三十六年就是耶穌降生一九四七年的聖誕節，將是我們中華民國和全體人民統一獨立平等自由新生機運肇始的一天」。可知此後我國的民主憲政必將和那代表着民主力量的基督敎結着深緣。惟其如此，今後我們對於某督敎世界裏的的動態，自當時刻注意，不可故步自封的了。</p>
<p>因爲如此，我們讀到敎宗庇護十二世的廣播，特別感到興奮；而最使我們感慰的是敎宗對於中國的關心。他說：「歐洲以及全世界，包括遙遠而滿被創傷的中國，距眞正的和平，完全而肯定的復興，以公理協議爲據的新秩序，較前益見疏遠。創否認與分歧說者，自信彼等之日子已愈見接近，而和平的友人，持久協調之促進者，以基督精神與今日世界遠離基督精神之困苦情形相較之下，不禁衷心深自悲切。然眞正之基督力量，較任何人更能認識吾人目前所處時代之意義。在兩大勢力競爭世界主人地位之今日，仇恨對於人類具有更大的吸引力，各種象徵似均趨向分裂之途，然人類之眞愛可以完成世界之團結。吾人謹於是日向世界奉信眞主及和平之人，發出吾人內心的呼籲。」敎宗又曾引了莎士比亞名劇哈孟雷德中的名句，重新提出「信從基督呢？還是反對　督？這是一個問題。」正如我們所言，目前的世界局勢可以說是基督與反基督的鬥爭，仁愛與仇恨的鬥爭，民主與極權的鬥爭，在這個時候而敎宗重提「信從基督呢？還是反對基督？」這一個問題，益加上了一種新鮮的意義，就是「信從民主呢？還是信從極權？，」目前世界的紛擾，美蘇兩大國的角逐，其起因主要怕也就由於這個問題。何去　從，中國人民當能自己審擇！</p>
<p>從敎宗這篇演辭裏，我們可以看見基督敎的理想中正和平，　與我立國的基礎三民主義相脗合。敎宗所講的眞愛就是我們的仁愛。只有基於仁愛，世界纔能團結，「天下一家」和我們所具有的世界大同的理想纔能實現。仇恨對於人類也許具有更大的吸引力，但仁愛終能克服仇恨。我們以仁愛爲基礎的三民主義作我們建國的最高指導原則，我們願以我們的力量來致力於世界和平和秩序的重建，同時亦願以仁愛為基礎的基督敎國家，對於我們目前所處的困難能有更深的認識，在我們的戡亂建國上，能有同情的援助。全世界的民主力量能如此聯合一致，則一定可以制止極權力量脫胎換骨的重現，而世界和平秩序的重建，也自然可以期望在最短的時期內得以達到目的。我們必須以仁愛克服仇恨，以民主克服極權。</p>

<p>霍氏對過去發生行政過失及舞弊事件，坦白承認管理及制度方面未能週密，但稱：據本署調査處所經辦之案件僅佔員工總數二萬餘人中千分之三，比較而言，當不算過大之過失。</p>
<p>聯總克署致詞，略謂聯總駐華分署即將正式結束，此推行國際間合作的試騐亦吿一段落。</p>
<p>聯總運華物資尙未完畢者約有十萬噸，其中包括來自澳洲之火車頭，及英國器械等。本署應中國政府之請，酌留一部份技術人員照顧工作，另有五外籍人士參加保管委員會。此外並特贈美金五百萬元作爲延續該會計劃之外匯費用。本人則擬再留華一個月，俟將職務移交與保管會後返國。</p>
<p>茲悉，霍署長於行總結東後決足任輸出入管理委員會主任委員之職云。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕行德經政院核准於年底結束，自明年一月起，該署即專辦全部淸理工作，此後救濟工作將由社會部繼續辦理，善後工作則由新近成立之善後事業委會接辦。</p>

<h3>劉峙談遊臺觀感　風俗習慣人情均與內地無異　各界對國際陰謀家一致嚴斥</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕劉峙將軍月初應魏主席道明之邀，赴台灣遊歷，歷時逾半月，於日前自台乘機飛滬。記者昨往晋謁　詢台遊觀感，承告：台灣爲中國固有之領土，最近少數國際陰謀家，企圖使台灣脫離中國，妄主所謂「自決」「託治」，台省各地民意機關及新聞界無不，嚴詞駁斥，一致抨擊，就余此次在台實地觀察所得，台省無論風俗習慣人情，均與內地各省無異，日人統治台灣五十一年，並未達到同化台人之目的，台人大部由閩粤兩省移殖，亦有自內地各省移往者，如在前淸，由江西移往者，即有數千人，在台從事各種手工業。日人統治台灣，純採殖民地政策，以建立爲南進根據地，遂其侵略野心，故在政治，敎育，經濟各方而，待台人均不平等，政府高級官吏全係日人，敎育上施行奴化，合人鮮有受高等敎育之機會，如台灣大學學生三千人，台人僅及十公之一，在經濟上盡量榨取原料，土地百分之七十收歸政府，經過土劣之手，轉租農民，農民辛苦耕耘後，須以百分之七十五繳納政府，自留百分之二十五。光復後則成反比例，故農民生活大見改善，合人在日人統治時代，處於奴隸地位，現則省市縣各級民意機關，均已普遍建立，省府亦能尊重民意，勵精圖治。余此次在台，曾至最北之基隆與最南之鵝鑾鼻，並參觀日月潭大發電廠，阿里山大林塲，嘉南大　礦塲，糖廠，鉛廠，煉油廠，水泥廠，覺其一切建設頗為偉大艱巨，有非內地各省所能及，地震，颶風，暴雨，　　等，素稱臺灣五害，尚能有此成績，足見人爲可以勝天，據建廳規　長語　，如在　她用一分力量建設，在臺灣須用八分，可見內地各省茍能集中力量，銳意建設，其成效必凌　臺省之上。　在台時，曾應邀參加　　市政府成立二週年紀念典禮，並為林故主席紀念碑揭幕，　林故主席靑年時代曾服官該地，嘉義人士特為建碑紀念，以示迫思。</p>

<h3>東京國際法庭座無隙地　戰爭罪魁東條受審　由美律師當庭宣讀六萬言之辯護狀　竟稱日本作戰係出於自衛</h3>

<p>東條自戰犯席上，步入見證席時，其淸癯之面頰上，迄露富於自信之微笑。今日國際法庭中，人山人海，此諸好奇之聽審者，咸欲一睹此一度叱咤風雲之日本獨裁者，並親聆其辯護。平日半虛其席之記者座，今亦吿客滿。按東條內閣被控爲應負襲擊珍珠港之責任，東條否認轟炸珍珠港爲預定之偸襲。渠稱：若謂日本以曖昧手段，故意延宕宣戰之照會，從而使此偸襲獲得成功，乃不可置信之事，且戰事實證明美國對於吾人之襲擊，事先早已獲悉，且早有準備，故　延宣戰之照會，實無任何特別作用。渠並謂：英美援助中國政府，致令日本無法解決「中國事件」，且英　美旣以經濟壓力加諸日本，日本乃不得不行使其自衛之絕對權力，以擊破包圍日本之障碍，故日本政府買個心施用武力，乃係出自自保自衛之需要一點，實不言可喻。</p>

<h3>東條辯護書要點</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿六日電〕東條供詞全文要點如下：「余從未意料，生持此次戰爭竟被勝利國斥爲國際罪行，戰敗國之合法官史，被個別認爲罪犯，余以爲身爲首相，罪無可逃，該方面之責任余虔誠願意全部接受。」東條始終企圖開脫日皇對戰爭之責任：「關於天皇之眞正地位，不應有所誤解，事實全部責任均應由內閣及總司令部負責人員担當。關於突襲珍珠港未先期警吿美國一節，供狀稱：日皇「曾屢次詔示本人及陸海軍參謀總長，應在進攻前發出警吿，天皇之意志曾傳達與聯絡會議。本人良知上相信，宣戰通知常時恪　外務省訓令傳遞美方，吾人常然在執行如此大事上信賴吾人之外交官員。」關於美國及盟邦飛行員處死事，東條承認制定有關戰俘法律之資，然辯稱日本從未批准日內瓦公約，「日本關於戰俘之觀念與歐美不同。」東條並指斥美國飛行員違反國際公法，作爲日本於一九四三年通過戰俘懲戒法之藉口：「一九四二年四月十八日，杜立德所座飛行員侵犯東京地區，違反國際公法及規程，犯有暴行，蓋依公認之國際法，攻擊平民係一種罪行。」東條稱：渠曾以陸軍大臣之身份，減輕因轟炸日本而被判死刑八美空軍中五人之刑罰。東條否認曾延遲將美故羅斯福總統最後一分鐘之函件呈遞日皇。渠稱，初聞此函時，機動部隊上之機羣已起飛矣，「蓄意阻延國元首致日皇之函件，等於凟犯皇上，日本無人敢爲此事。」東條自陳初奉組閣命之驚異及遲疑不決，然而再爲日本之地位辯護，渠稱，由於美英荷之「包圍」日本，致解決「中國事件」成爲不可能。東條圖將三國公約之責任推諉故外相松岡洋右，並稱：日本其後之國策不稍受該約之影響，尤其是日本在談判公約時，被德蘇之表面睦誼所愚。松岡乃於事後與蘇聯簽訂中立條約，然亦乏實際利益。其後蘇聯於取得擴地之保證後，於中立條約仍有效時即答應並進攻日本。東條稱：松岡在談判三國公約時，赴柏林一行，養成一種政治成見，對美國力求妥協之努力表示冷淡。近衛二次內閣之所以續辭職，亦由於松岡之態度，冀藉以排擠松岡，而與美國及同盟國之談判，冀能順利完成。東條又稱：「中國事件之迅速解決需要斷絕重慶與英美荷在南方之合作。三國在南方積極備戰，完成對日包圍　，美國高級官員屢有挑戰性之言論及行動，經濟壓力之加强，吾人獲取生存必需品之受阻撓，及英美聯合越南泰國之企圖，在在表現敵性行動，日荷關係荷印商業談判破裂後，包圍圈遂告完成。」日本在美資產之凍結　英荷之具有「最密切之聯　」，各國將日本之商業驅向毀滅之境。「吾人與世界兩最大國家抗衡，勝利希望顯然不大，然日本不得不在太平洋及印度洋上前進，堅守重要戰略據點，爲軍事目的佔據地區，盡力擊退敵方之攻擊。然最高指揮部及日政府並無針對特別敵人之戰爭計劃。吾人目的在防止戰爭而不在準備戰爭」。東條力斥日皇贊成戰爭之說，「一九四一年十一月二日，天皇接獲兩項抉擇性之計劃時，余自其表情上看到其由愛好和平信念听引起之悲感，天皇於聽取吾人之計劃時，莊重深慮之至，然後對此抱憾「如吾人無法打破僵局，除違反本意與英美作戰外，豈別無他途可循否！聯希望諸君盡力克復談判中之困能』。」東條稱，渠　　一天皇之焦慮」，已盡全力維護和平。</p>

<h3>潘議長夫人　廣播募寒衣</h3>
<p>潘議長夫人唐冠玉女士，昨日下午七時，應上海市婦女會之邀，在中央廣播電台播講，呼籲全市婦女界爲冬令救濟，加緊勸募寒衣及現金，茲錄其廣播詞於左：</p>
<p>諸位同胞：天氣是一天天地冷了。當次年近歲逼，風雪交加的時候，街頭啼飢號寒的難民，也一天天地多了。他們或來自蘇北，或來自安徽，或來自山東。他們的家鄕受共匪的騷擾破壞，田園荒蕪，房屋損毀。他們的產業，他們的工作，已經一無所有，成了失業待救的一羣！</p>
<p>這一大羣的難民，他們同樣是黃帝的子孫，同樣是中華民國的國民，但人家在慶祝聖誕，歡度新年；而他們却無衣無食，朝不保暮。他們都是我們的同胞，自身並沒有罪過，可是因爲喪心病狂的共匪，到處流竄擾亂，他們遭受到無可形容的災禍，不能再在匪區裏生活下去。同時，他們又不願聽命於共匪的擺佈，祗好離鄉背井，扶老携幼，不遠千里百里，流浪到大上海這都市裏來，作死裏求生的掙扎。上海市的同胞們！我們雖然也感覺到物價高漲，生活困難，但無論如何，總還可以勉强過日子；何况上海還有不少生活優裕的家庭，樂善好施的仁人君子，一定會同情這此成千成萬的難胞，伸出溫暖的手去援助他們的。</p>
<p>上海市婦女會因此發起，在冬令救濟會的號召之下，擴大我們的徵募寒衣運動。我們大家立志，要在這極短期間，呼籲全上海的太太小姐們，趕緊將各人自己家裏多餘的棉衣棉被，或其他可以禦寒的衣服，檢點一下，盡量捐助到浦東同鄕會三樓三二○號，或南京西路五八○號上海市婦女會　收，以便縫時分批送給各庇寒所的難胞穿着，使得他們勉强可以度過嚴寒的冬天。假使沒有舊衣舊袴，我們更其盼望儘量捐輸現款，送到上海市婦女會來，我們自然會立刻代爲定製棉衣，分贈難胞，爲諸姑姊妹大家造福。</p>
<p>諸位同胞，我們中國人向來講究做好事的。所謂「積善之家，必有餘慶」，以及「助人爲快樂之本」，無非說明帮助人家，濟困扶危，一定自身可以得到無上的安慰，子孫可以得到大德的蔭庇。而士海一市，賑災濟難的善舉，尤其一向站在中國全國的最前綫。諸姑姊妹們，大家看到這許多寒風瑟瑟中衣不蔽護，食不果腹的難胞，力其是婦女和孩子們的苦况，一定都感覺到不忍袖手旁觀，讓他們去凍死餓死的。誠懇的希望諸位，發揮人類的同情心，踴躍捐　寒衣或現欵，伸出大家一雙　暖的手來，援助那些被共匪迫害而無家可屬的難胞。「救人一命，勝造七級浮屠！」我在這　廣播呼觀，敬爲樂審好施的諸姑姊妹們祝福！</p>

<p>其他復且大學，上海法學院，輩約翰，之江，東美，上海商學　　討　，市立工　，交通大　均紛紛　　或分頭勸募，或社各區向難民分發，進行均極熱烈。</p>
<h3>又一共匪補給機關破獲　要犯十餘名解南通審訊</h3>
<p>﹝中央社訊﹞南通漁民自衛隊彭繼雲部，於本月七日在呂泗港外海緝獲匪方運輸船一艘，抄獲製圖印幣用之重磅道林紙二十八令，乾電池一百六十打。經檢査其押運員身份，獲悉該項物資係運交奸匪華中第九軍分區江海貿易公司總經理張渭淸（化名陳永福）。轉解軍區當局，幷供認該項道林紙乾電池，係由軍分區所撥之公棉運滬脫售換來，經手人爲上海某花行經理某人，負責者爲某地某人等語。第一區綏靖司令部乃派第二處上校課長季仲鵬，組長朱崇文，率同偵辦人員來滬偵查。嗣又令死二處處長蔣劃民來滬策動指揮，復經季娛長亭先商准警備司令部稽查處陶處長一珊，仍假該處水上　六隊部爲臨時辦公處，幷由該大隊隊長馮仲　指派幹負一批協助、部署完成。於本月十七日夜開始行動。於戴日間，即騰匪方在要關人犯奸商重要者共十餘名，予以　　　軟　。抄　文件中，有匪方採辦軍需　貸雙三大張，品名數百磁；尙有　　澤東傑版肖像一枚，匪新華日報　質報　二方及煽動學潮之宣傳品一大批。抄獲臟物，有　自匪　運來之「公棉」大小二百餘包，及其一部份生財。蔣處長已將有關案犯，訊供筆錄，贓物等，悉解南通司令部訊究後，呈報國防部核辦。</p>

<h3>影院業堅拒查賬　決自動調整座價　公會負責人稱日期在元旦左右</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕電影院商爲電影票漲價問題，昨日集會交換意見。據公會負責人談稱：電影票價自九月六日調整以來，物價已一再上升，各項開支浩大，實感不能維持。本市平劇院票價一再自動調整，至今最高票價十六萬，約爲戰前之八萬倍。其他地方戲票價亦爲戰前之五萬餘倍。獨電影院目前最高票價二萬五千元，猶爲戰前一萬二千五百倍，而每次調整票價均須呈准後方得施行，不若其他劇院之得縫時自動調整。前次反對於票價附征二成冬令救濟捐，係因牴觸娛樂稅法，此次各電影院呈請自十二月十五日起將粟價調整一倍，社會局至今猶在審核中，並表示需呈核營業賬目查明有虧蝕情形後方准漲價。同業認爲並無營私舞弊情形，該項査賬並無根據，故堅決拒絕。該會負責人並表示電影票之漲價至今已非「勢在必爭」而爲「勢在必行」。各電影院將實行自動調整，其日期當爲元旦左右。各院此舉，「甘受處分」。該業日內將召開全體會員大會，對此作正式決定。</p>

<p>自殺·　·前夕</p>
<p>前日聖誕節，朱女異常興奮，購來大批糖果遍贈同事，昨日下午又邀友好共進晚餐，並親自做菜，飯後共赴舞場遊玩，談笑如常，僅於舞塲中戲語友伴，謂：「今晚在此共歡，明日我將走矣」。詢以何往？曰：「上天堂」。衆以其家住抗州，將去杭省母，亦未深究。至午夜十二時，始由友伴送回宿舍。與朱同住一室之另一同事潘一萍，適於上日吿假去京，遂予朱從容自殺機會。</p>
<p>發覺·　·已遲</p>
<p>殆至昨晨六時許，潘由京歸來，見宿舍房門緊閉拉之即啓，竟未上鍵，潘入室即嗅到强烈之來沙而藥水味，朱見潘入，突自床上一躍起身，奪門而出作嘔吐狀，潘見狀知生變故，且發見桌上留有來沙而空瓶，乃高呼鄰室同事，一陣忙亂，車送鐵路醫院，雖經洗胃等急救，然中毒已深，回生無術，延至七時四十八分殞命。</p>
<p>遺書·　·同事</p>
<p>後悉朱自殺之念，早於二星期觀即已決定，其致同事李冰潔遺書中有：「幾個星期前我即想死，人生對我已不値得留戀，二星期前會向同事借手槍」（按便衣女警無槍）云云。遺　中並附贈照片一張，又稱：「你是我最好的朋友，自你結婚以後，　我們冷淡了，這是環境使然，這是尋，送你的照片，這是你留着，永遠紀念」。最後連書「我爲什麽」與「我好苦」三句。遺書全文約二千字之多。至其所有已記及往來書信，自殺前均已燒毀，對遺物何者贈送同事，何者送予姑媽，亦均預爲詳細標明。</p>
<p>原因·　·揣測</p>
<p>警務處於案發後，即電無錫，召朱友李冰潔來滬訊問，李已於昨日下午抵滬。記者昨晚往訪，據李談，朱有未婚夫名白水，現在東北任職於交警十七中隊，與朱素不善，近有白友張運康者，係空軍駕駛員，來滬訪朱，並數邀其出遊，頗有追求之意，惟朱對之毫無好感。張求愛不成，不免憎恨，向白進讒，挑撥離間，此亦使朱受一大刺激。朱之家庭亦甚複雜，不容於父，故自殺原因必非單純云。</p>
<h3>情婦復操賤業　姘夫欲與共死</h3>

<p>西藏客商·　·找到活佛</p>
<p>現在的達賴十四世乃是他的四弟。他們一家本是育海藏族，務農爲業，自達賴十三世物化後，藏人四出尋覓替身，歷三年餘尙未找到。民國廿七年時他們家中來了一批西藏客商借宿一宵，其實這批人是喬裝而來尋找活佛的。達賴十四世當時年僅四歲，他們發現後詢問之下，生日時辰完全符合，並且還識得老達賴的造物，後來就把這位小達賴護送到拉薩登位，到今年已有十三歲了。</p>
<p>次弟肄業·　·中央軍校</p>
<p>他們弟兄共有五人，第三第五兩位弟弟現仍在靑海，第二位弟弟名呌嘉榮，現年十九歲，去年隨西藏國大代表東來，後進中央軍校唸書，現在國語已講得很不差。昨天他到上海來迎接他哥哥，記者訪問時，就由他翻譯，他穿了空軍制服皮夾克，完全像一個摩登的都市靑年，與他哥哥站在一起有如兩個時代的人物了。</p>
<p>託布丹結美諤布活佛，在西藏宗敎方面的地位相當高，但他對於政治並無接觸。據他說西藏最近局勢尙屬安定，英國人在拉薩辦醫院很得人心，達賴則於最近曾講經兩次，在西藏是很大的盛典。</p>

<h3>市府緊縮編制　可能明春實施　各局處裁員十之一　副局長職仍擬留任</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府編制緊縮問題，昨日市政會議中曾作鄭重討論。政院核定之市府組織規程中，原有機構均准設置，惟員額方面，市府申請之總人數爲三千五百七十六人，政院令飭裁減達三分之一。市府於奉到訓令後，即令各局處主管詳細硏究，分別提供意見，由人事處彙齊，並會同研究後，決依照編制員額，各局處平均栽減十分之一，約爲三百餘人。各局之副局長，以事實上有需要，仍擬留任。至於其他若干實際困難點，如新組織規程中，公用局現有之卞四科裁爲六科，其他各局亦有同樣裁撤情形，市府以事實上　以遵辦，決暫予維持現狀，一面將具體情形申覆政院，至於業經決定之裁員標準，係根據其資歷，及平時工作考動標準爲原則，可能於明春起實施。</p>

<h3>曲阜朝聖　魯西南行</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿三日航訊〕山東一〇七縣中，截至目前，有爾個縣共黨已告絕跡，其一是衆所週知由張天佐專員兼攝縣篆的昌樂縣，另外一個就是「聖賢桑粹」的曲阜縣。</p>
<p>曲阜在王縣長震宇治理下，先後已逾十年，遠在抗戰期間，就由他率領全縣廿三萬民衆與敵寇打游擊，卅四年年底，共匪集中三萬餘人來攻，王縣長率地方團隊抗拒，至卅五年元旦日，終以衆寡懸殊，被匪攻陷，王縣長於</p>
<p>黑夜中化裝</p>
<p>自城牆跳出，得以身免。卅六年三月九日，王在國軍協助下，光復縣城後，即銳意組織民衆，訓練民衆，指導民衆，控制民衆，對眞正自新來歸的共黨份子都一律予以優容，勵行寬大政策，嚴禁人民自由報復，平日無事時，幾乎三分之二的時問都往來巡視於各鄉鎭保閭間，深入民間，與民衆打成一片，切實剷除了貪汚士劣，與民更始，與民同甘苦，因此，八路便很自然的再不能在該縣容身，而切實做到了「當地無賊賊不來」。</p>
<p>曲阜舊城，原在城東四五里處，明移今址，城周圍計十二里，孔廟佔三分之一，我在王縣長陪同下贍仰了廟內的杏壇，先師手植檜，大成殿，魯壁，詩禮堂等聖蹟後，復往聖府參觀，適大成至聖先師奉祀官孔德或在家。談話中，知道他至暹於明年一月十五日前</p>
<p>必赴美考察</p>
<p>，爲期八一月，所有一切出國手續皆已辦妥，這次返里非爲競選，乃係「家祭」。他對政府提名爲曲阜縣的國大代表候選人，嘗三度懇辭，俱未獲准孔德成係孔子七十七世孫，現年約卅歲，美豐姿，御皮袍，戴皮帽，孔府的房屋是中國世家建築的典型，孔氏本人亦仍保留着很濃重的中國傳統的世家子弟的作風。在房屋的三門裏廳側仍掛着職司傳達的「承啓處」的白底黑字木牌，四門裏進復有「秘書處」，「庶務處」等木牌，只有在秘書處對面一座會客室係有白泥頂天花板及花磁磚的半中半西建築。孔與黨國元老張溥泉係忘年交，當我吿訴他溥老已於本月十六日患狹心症逝世時，他於表示極度沉痛及惋後告訴我：「溥老原有心臓病，此次突然</p>
<p>溘逝的近因</p>
<p>恐與山東選舉問題有關，原因是當丁淮汾老先生在濟將山東國大代表候選人名單帶京時，有幾位榜上無名的同鄉來京活動，溥老乃商得丁老先生同意後，在原擬名單中更動了幾位，此事被聞於被除名者，乃赴溥老處表示抗議，並謂：我們山東本有元老，而你是河北省的元老，請你別再顧問山東的事。薄老乃又將預擬名單予以復原，薄老的突然以狹心症病逝，對此或不無關係。」</p>
<p>八路在佔領曲阜期間，對孔廟及北門外孔林俱未破壞，只是孔林兩側紅色圍牆上被八路塗滿了標語，國軍於收復後，將標語洗括後並未東行粉刷，故一目望去，牆上斑剝特甚，然仍無損於孔林的莊嚴偉大。孔廟的廟產究竟有多少，外界知道者甚少，但據可靠方面傳出，原有地六千餘頃，東面直至黃海之濱，都有</p>
<p>孔家的廟產</p>
<p>八路佔領期間，嘗有一部被族人鬥爭，現在據說已發還，惟在外縣非國軍控制區域迄今仍始終收不到租。孔德成原係遺腹子，當他的父親衍聖宮孔令貽逝世後，由其叔孔靈儁代理，凡八年，但族人中因眼紅此「獎缺」亦一直將孔靈儁控吿攻擊了八整年，直待孔德成正式接事後，始吿平靜，他現在已有一子二女，子年六歲半，這一向成爲中國舊家庭中的嚴重問題，在孔府當可不再重演了吧。（特派員麗天）</p>

<p>錢兌業同業公會並應撤銷登記</p>
<p>上海金融管理局，以本市錢兌業向多經營外幣兌換業務，自政府明令取締黃金置賣及外幣流通後，該錢兌業早失其業務對象，不復有存在可能。惟查該業率多使用銀號錢莊牌名，殊與財政部核准之銀錢行莊名義淆混。該局爲止一視聽，並防杜流幣起見，決予整飭，爰經公告各該錢兌莊號，自即日起，除該業經營之錢兌務自應停止外，所有原用之銀號錢莊名稱及其市招，應予取銷。該業同業公會，並應撤銷登記，以符事實，而杜冒濫，如有延不遵照，或隔奉陰違者，一經查出，決予送法院依法嚴辦。該局除呈報財政部備案外，特函請市府查照。市府於廿六日分令警局，會同社會財政兩局　予執行，應取締之錢兌莊號，計共二零四家，其名單如次。</p>

<p>小型普遍劇降·華股情勢恍惚</p>
<p>華股昨有普遍性之出小進大活動，小型股漸有夕陽無限好之情况，永紗則尚穩定，惟過程亦見恍惚。空方反在塲外收貨，前途恐有大變動。</p>
<p>晨開見高，尤以小型股最爲吃香，勤興開高至五七元，新華且達漲限，開後情形轉變，小股暴漲過甚，瞬即下落，永紗則進至五五一元及五六〇元後，退至五四四元及五五三元。豐安掛漲停，永紗回上至五五〇元及五六〇元光景，塲外息價開低至二角四及二角八分半。永紗不久復疲，降至五四三元及五四九元，一度則漲到五六〇元及五六九元高峯，而迫降至五四七元及五五三元。永業掛漲停板，永紗午收爲五五四元及五六一元，各小型股除管理者放棄維持外，並有極普遍之出小進大活動，以致次熱反雜牌反以低價收市。信和則以高價結束，結果較前收即交股新光景福跌半成，景綸閘北小挫，信和火柴中興升半成，新華豐安永公華豐漲一成，永業漲停，中紡統益大通美亞商務均平，餘均小升。遞交股計華豐信和升半成，景福跌半成，新光勤興小挫，餘均徵升。</p>
<p>後市某種流言助長賣氣，國行差進不少，永紗急切下降，劇瀉殊多，尤以勤興曾跌至四一元爲最慘，旋得管理者之維持，小股轉危爲安，永紗收市即交爲五四八元，遞交反倒掛爲五四六元，結果校長收即交股計統益大通商務華豐景綸塵安景福新華華新各低半成，勤興跌一成，火柴平，餘均小挫。遞交股信和華豐勤興新光各跌半成左右，餘均徵降，塲外各老股仍見倘利，尤以大生一廠昂二成，三廠南洋新新華商世界各漲一成爲最多。</p>
<p>食米價又回漲·油市直綫上升</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬七千八百餘石，內地重見回漲，連帶影響，粳秈米均見回升二三萬元，白元堅挺之狀，陰之提高殺次。麵粉供不敷求，開盤後直綫上升，猛加萬餘元，漲價限度，各粉一致突出四十大關。麩皮亦然狂升萬元，尚乏貨應市。</p>
<p>豆餅交易雖淡，奈各物俱升，貨主益堅，跟漲萬元。黃豆客帮去化仍呆，本街平常，高貨平平，杜黃亦然少神，惟中下客豆則油廠納胃加强，提高萬餘元。蠶豆零化不振，平疲之局。菉豆供求兩稀，暫無波動，赤豆去化亦淡，價無出入。小麥到存兩枯，續漲二三萬元。</p>
<p>紅糧酒坊動辦甚股，挺升一二萬元。苞米北洋消化活洛，步漲萬元。生仁廣胃仍續，高貨再漲三五萬元，中次本街成交不多，暫成平平之狀。芝蔴天津暢辦，猛烈搜購，廣帮亦有染指，市形混亂，臨收飛奔不一，狂跳十餘萬至二十餘萬元不一。</p>

<p>紗管會召集棉紡業領袖談話希望民營廠切實合作</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國花紗布管理委員會主委袁晨，昨下午四時，召集六區棉紡公會首腦王啓宇，唐星海，劉靖基，榮爾仁等談話，袁氏表露全國花紗布管理辦法通過後，深望各紗廠切實合作，諸如存棉量，需棉量棉紗生產最等數字之申報，應從詳實。管理辦法如能切實執行三月至半截，即知該辦法決非剝削紡織業，而對紡織業前途之發展，極有帮助。民營廠各代表旋即表示意見數點：（一）管理辦法中，對增產並未提及。例如目前全國有紗錠四百五十萬枚，而開足者僅三百六十萬枚，停開之九十萬錠，應查明停開原因，速予開足，俾增產百分之廿棉紗，調　供需。（二）管理辦法中，對棉紗運銷各地，仍需憑證。此於各廠業務，　疑甚大。處茲物質短絀時期，似應减少阻礙棉紗運銷之規定。（三）紡紗織布各部門，過去均有密切之關係。統購統銷局面下，尤須注意及此。庶免因花紗布各部門固有優質原料供應之脫節，致各廠原有產口商標之令譽，毀於一旦。（四）棉花易紗之硬性規定，如遇生活指數或物價波動，而棉價依舊時，應請覓求變通辦法。袁生委當表示：祇需各廠能推誠合作，一切實施後可能遭遇之困難，無不願意接受考慮云。</p>
<h3>棉紗議價掛高廿支爲二九五二萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會棉紗議價，昨日業已調整，廿支紗掛高爲二九五二萬元。其他各支紗，按比例並參酌市况，分別規定。</p>
<p>又該會昨與紡建公司分別售紗，結果共售一六二六，五件，合廿支紗二三〇四·五件·申購單共三六四張。紡調會售紗價，廿支共十種，自如意三千萬元起，至紅魁星三二〇〇萬元止。卅二支鹽鳳三九五〇〇萬元，四十支日光四三〇〇萬元，四十二支雙股藍鳳四九五〇萬元。</p>
<p>紗價盤堅</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因紡建公司開售議價提高，更以同業銀根轉鬆，胃口較健，客帮亦來問津，市塲情勢，又以青島紗廠彼迫停工，人心大都看好，行情盤堅。詎至十一時半，紡建突然懸牌，接受同業申請喊價趨疲，迨至收時，各方進取不絕，價復挺秀。結果四十二支藍鳳細紗，即期價五千萬關，明日期五千零五十萬元，比上日步昂五十萬元。此外四十支卅二支各紗亦漲一·二十萬至七八十萬，廿支紗互有升沉，十六及十支等粗紗，軋好十五萬至五六十萬不一云。</p>
<p>布市略軟</p>
<p>棉布市况，晨開因隔日紡建開布，一律統配，嗶嘰售出尤多，市上籌碼增加，浮多了吐甚夥，並聞山西帮敗進之大量嗶嘰通知單，已有少數吐出，行情一度下挫，嗣至十點半後，有漢口帮突來吸收嗶嘰棧單頗多，廣帮亦有進胃，市勢轉堅，廠家則因分發員工年賞關係，頭寸軋緊，進意懈怠，本街買戶亦稀。結果十二磅龍頭細布限價一百傘七萬二千元不動，但塲外喊高至一百卅八萬六七千元有成交。其餘各檔細布，軋小四·八千至一，二萬元。此外除直貢及藍布挺秀，其餘各布大都呈明平暗軟之勢</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡織品外銷委員會息：該會自上月廿四日起，迄今業已辦妥出口換取印棉之棉布，共達一二三七四一疋。</p>
<h3>棉商昨開大會力爭今後地位</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市棉花商業同業公會，昨下午二時假市商會召開臨時會員大會，主席團劉屏蓀，鄭哲丞，陳清琤三人，首由劉陳二氏致辭，略謂：通過之花紗布管理辦法中，棉商並無地位。而棉商已有八千餘年歷史，抗戰時棉商對搶購棉花，厥功殊偉。此次統購政策公佈後，棉價貶跌，棉商受損尤大。現管理辦法中，紗商布商均有地位，而棉前幾天獨無。旋即開始討論，最後決議：推定劉屏蓀等十七人，於今日下午三時，召開小組會，研究詳細辦法，然後再於下週一往訪調會袁主委請願云。</p>
<h3>燃管負責人談煤斤供應狀况</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據燃管會負責人稱：最近以北寗路運輸不暢，爲增加存底計，今後當向台灣及津浦路方向設法，務使其來源暢達，以補不足。台省經常輸出煤斤，每月共四萬噸，內中二萬噸運至粵閩兩地，五千噸至青島，其餘則歸上海。本月份已運到者，共一七四〇吨，并有台南輪已於本月廿三日裝七千餘噸，月底準可到滬。津浦沿綫之淮南華東中興各礦，其產量每月共達廿萬噸，已運至浦口者四萬噸。已向路局　接洽運輸，不久即可源源南下。又悉：北寗路曾於本月九日被匪破壞路軌甚多，是以本月上旬運至秦皇島之煤斤，僅五萬噸。經搶修後，業於廿四日起恢復運輸，并有少數煤斤由產地運出。并鑒於青島存煤不如上海豐富，爲提前供應計，最近已由秦皇島運青者，計七各六百噸，內中以二千噸撥交中國紡建公司，其餘交與該地電廠云。</p>
<h3>三年同盟債票限期換發竣事</h3>
<p>逾限即作捐獻論</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：財政部以卅三年盟債經收事宜，結束已久，惟各地對於該項債票，尚有未經換發完竣，該部項頃已通飭各省市財政廳局，統限於卅七年三月底以前換發竣事，渝限作捐獻國家，轉解國庫云。</p>
<h3>統債外股平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨頗爲平庸，統丙晨開三〇〇〇〇元，低價二九三〇〇元，高價三一〇〇〇元，而後以〇五〇〇元之價收市。較前收計甲乙平，丙升二百元，丁漲四百元，戊挫二百元，成交三百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨升沉不一，但大體平庸少變，怡紗晨開四二萬八，自四三萬步降至四一萬五而後略定，但後市仍鮮振作，廣帮則出，證券帮洋行帮均納。結果較前收計英聯電車墾植業廣尚平，電車跌半成，餘股榮辱俱微。</p>
<h3>美國戰時公債廿四日起跌價</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據有關方面稱：美國戰時公債於二十四日開始，聯合準備銀行已表示將一九六七—七二年九月之二，五釐公債行情，由7037-32元跌至7038-32，一九六七—七二年十二月之二·五釐公債行情由7077-32元跌至7038-32元，一九五九—六二年之二·五釐公債行情，由70073-32元至100元。聯準並曾於二十三日晚，召集經營此項公債之經紀人，公開表示，對跌價後之公債新行情，鑒予全力維持。此項消息，對我國美匯前途，不無關係。另據本市某金融界權威人士談稱，此項消息，可確證美國貨幣現亦在繼漲貶值中。聯合準備銀行此舉，因恐經營此項公債之銀行及經紀人因貨幣之貶值而拋售持有之公債，而作其他不利於金融市塲之營運，故表示對跌價後之公債　準價顯予維持。因此吾人可預測我國對美匯匯率，在短期內尚不致再放長云。</p>
<h3>銀行業同業公會理監事聯席會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行業同業公會，於昨日下午五時許，召開理監事聯席會議，理事長李馥蓀主席。重要討論提案有：財政前向各行借款，多以戰前發生之公債，將以一對一折還，銀行業所受之虧損太大，且銀行業戰前存款，亦已通過加一千七百倍發還，故咸主呈請財政部另商妥善處理辦法。又對於繳付特種營業稅亦獲重要決定如次：（二）稅率不變按照百分之四繳付。（三）由各總行彙集交稅，以資正確而得便利。（四）俟年終總結算後，通告會各會員一體辦理。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>中央銀行貼放委員會主任要崇墉，奉派兼任漢口金融管理局局長，在林氏離滬期間，所有貼會秘書職務，業經張總裁派該行顧問陳述曾暫代。</p>
<p>全國花紗布管理委員會，將於今日下午召開首次臨時委員會議，由袁主委指示會務開展方針會亦將於年內召開會議，俾討論結束會務事宜。</p>
<p>中國紡建公司定於今日上午嬉開董事會議，董事長陳啓天將親臨主持，　聞對花紗布管理後，公司業務應如何開展，又如紗管委會託公司代辦業務時，應如何處理，均將提出討論云。</p>
<p>又晨林部棉產諮詢委員會，亦定今日下午四時假該公司開例會。</p>
<p>淮南礦路及大通煤礦兩公司，昨日下午假中國銀行四樓嬉開聯合股東臨時會。主席朱用　，除報告淮南大通兩公司合併經過外，並核定重估兩公司固定資產價值調整資本方案，計調整後資本總額一百八十億元，分一億八千萬股，每股一百元。</p>
<p>昨銀根略緊，暗息二角四，四行兩局差進一一〇一億，中央入七四四億，大交換八三四億，外商入一五六億，小交換出一二九一億，中國出一四八億，交通入二二三億，中信局入三〇七億，其他行局無大出入。</p>

<p>文史胡適題</p>
<h3>立芬司董—論歷史和文學在敎育上的功用</h3>
<p>— 毛子水</p>
<p>英國牛津大學副校長立芬司董（Livingstone）爵士，於一九四三年寫了一本小書，名爲「一個浮漂世界的敎育」。這本書和立氏前後所寫的討論敎育的書一樣，極値　關心現代問題的人和敎育家的仔細抽讀。書中有一章係用敎育的關點來看歷史和文學的，立論極爲平正通達。我現在把這章的大意約略軍述出來，以當介紹。</p>
<p>立氏以爲敎育應以養成德操爲第一要務，而德操的養成，在使學子多看人生中的偉大的，多識人生中的上上品的。人生中的偉大的景象，每個學校中的文學和歷史兩種科目都敎給我們。</p>
<p>但我們如果要把人生中的上上品的景象看得眞切，我們須用一種特別的眼光來讀文學和歷史。書的讀法，非止一種。請先談歷史。我們可以把他看作一朝一姓盛衰興亡的紀錄；但掩卷不久，我們便把那些事迹忘却了。當然，我們可以注意到特別一種事情上，如文明的生長，政治思想的發達等等。這些都是應該有的，必要的學問。但這還不是歷史在敎育上的大目的。如果我們要在歷史上和文學上得到精神的價値和「良善」的榜樣，我們須仔細去尋覓。數十年來，歷史敎學的風尙，凡有三變。最先是注重在帝王和將相，外交和戰爭　後來乃注意到社會的狀况和平民的生活；最後，歷史乃成爲人類由動物而進於野人，由野人而進於文明的故事。人類的進步，有多種原因。生理，氣候，經濟各爲一因；大的人物亦爲一因。民族的興衰，文明的消長，的確可以給我們一偉大」的景象，但在大人物的言行裏，我們可以把人類的勇敢和堅忍，人類對於智慧的欲望和對於「善」的誠敬，—這些是人類由暗到明由野到文的純正力量，—看得很淸楚。</p>
<p>我們可以把創造文明的人分爲三大類。一是行動的人，一是思想的人，一是啓示的人。這三種人乃文明大索的三股。我們如果有一股認不淸，我們便不知全索的結構。法拉第，達爾文，巴斯　，亞丹斯密等人的影響，自然很大；但他們的影饗和蘇格拉底，柏拉岡，斯多噶，耶穌，奧古斯丁等人的不同，和亞歷山大，奧古斯　，格蘭惠爾，拿破崙等人的更不同。我們如果把歷史當作人類進化的紀錄讀，我們須把這文明大索的三股—精神的，知識的，政治的，—全看淸楚。在紀元前第五世紀的雅典，我們須記到蘇格拉底和德謨克力　（古代希臘原子學說的闡揚者）以及彼理克力斯（雅典政治家）；在十二世紀的時候，我們須記到聖伯納（St.Bernard）以及亨利第；十六世紀的時候，我們須記到脫麥氏　爾，哥白尼，以及亨利第八和馬丁路德；在第十九世紀的時候，我們須記到達爾文和舒治伯（Shatesbury）以及俾士麥和加富爾。歷史家往往　於偏見。早期的敎士，看不見思想和知識的那一股；現代的袁爾士，除却科學的一糾外，又忽略了他股。</p>
<p>在　　緩的，迂迴的以及斷續的人類的進步上面，蘇格拉底好像比彼理克力斯重要，聖伯納比弗力得力克重要，脫麥氏摩爾比亨利第八重要，巴斯德和達爾文又比俾士麥重要。不過這樣看法，我們不免有看輕事業家的危險。實在，一個兼有偉大和良善兩樣成分的政治家，對文明的貢獻可能少一點，但和宗敎家改革家科學家一樣値得敬崇；因爲他的工作，或許比他們還要艱難一點。</p>
<p>精神生活方面，我們亦可以分爲幾等。有一等人是開創新生面的。何錫亞（Hosea）說，「我希望有仁慈而不需要犧牲。」耶穌說，「你們聽人說過，你須愛你的鄰人而恨你的仇人。但我吿訴你：愛你們的仇人；恨你們的人，你們亦好好待他們。這樣，你們就可以做上帝的子孫。」選種說話，這種見解，是可以改變世界的；是啓示較高的生存水準的；是孕育新生命的。</p>
<p>其次就是修身潔行的人。蘇格拉底是這樣的人；聖伯納亦是這樣的人。在艱難困苦的時代，沒有幾個人比聖伯納更値得效法了。在他那時代，盜賊橫行，宗敎腐敗。他可以隨波逐流，以茍全性命於亂世，亦可以流入悲觀而自暴自棄。但他却不然。他用他的毅力和決心，置身於一無望的戰爭中，以冀轉變這個世界改良這個世界。要是世界上沒有幾個這樣的人，人類或許不會有什麽進步。</p>
<p>我們再轉到文學方面。文學和歷史一樣，是貯藏人生中第一等成就的寳庫。讀文學亦如讀歷史，要看我們所取的途徑怎樣。平常我們唸一篇散文或一首詩，我們可以注意到寫作的時期，文章的來歷，作者的履歷和同時人對於他的作品的欣賞；我們亦可以注意到技術方面，爲文字，聲調，結構等；我們亦可以用一副消磨歲月的心情來讀他；我們亦可以因爲要得先哲的人生觀和世界觀的目的而　他。文學在敎育上的功用，就是由於最後這個觀點。</p>
<p>有些文學，是直捷的啓示人類生活和性情的上上品的，如安諾特的「道德」，渥茲渥夫的「義務贊「或他的」一個幸福的戰士的品性。」這些詩讀起來幾乎和柏拉圖，斯賓諾莎或康德的篇章一樣。在這些文字上面，我們覺得詩歌是人生的批評，是沒有系統的道德哲學。道樣的詩，和哲學一樣，二十歲以後的人比二十歲以前的人易於領會，易於欣賞。</p>
<p>在有些詩歌中，人生的意想，不是單純的說出，而是附着在事物上邊的。如渥茲渥夫的「水蛭採集人」是一個例。這首詩的副題「決心和獨立」，是顯示詩人心中當時的意想的。</p>
<p>還有一等詩歌，如斯賓塞的「神后」，密爾敦的「失去了的樂園」，雪萊的「解放了的普羅密法氏」，鄧尼生的「王風」，都含有人生觀在裏面，但不是很明顯的。</p>
<p>這些詩人，都是要想把他們的道德觀念　訓的。但是道德家不一定是最好的講道德的人。幸運得很，英國非特產生世界最大的詩人，並且這個詩人的善惡的觀念，是一點不含糊的。人類各種性格，各種興趣，除開宗敎和科學二端以外，都可在莎士比亞作品中找到。他所描寫的人物，有好的，有壞的，有大的，有小的；但誰善誰惡，分得很淸楚。</p>
<p>人生和人性中的上上品，散見於歷史和文學中的很多，只要人們知道去找。但這裏又有一偶間題起來了。好的和壞的，嘉　和秕稗，混雜的生長在這些田地上。阿鐵拉，坡佳，弗理德力克大帝，在一個意義上，是偉人。Villon,Boccaccio亦可以說是第一等的文人。但這種優越，不是我們所要找的。文學和歷史中，正像人生中，是善惡都有的，並且是混起來的。要是不管好歹，不細心去選擇，那是很危險的。最壞的是染着那些不正常的意見，受了「誨淫誨盜」的毒；最好的亦只成了一個「無是非之心」的人。我們決不願意呌我們心地純潔的靑年，受着這種作品的害處。這是教育上一大問題。</p>
<p>我們要實行抽燬或删改的方法麽？這是差不多不可的。我們能抽　歷史麽？大奸巨兇的紀載，難道我們都能抹去麽？別的不講，耶敎　經由　有　有壞　這　一本　　機去　訂　？不過我們雖然不能去抽燬或删訂，我們總須有個善惡的分別。</p>
<p>歷史中的偉大人物，有的如恒星，是永遠放着光耀的；有的如隕星，看起來雖比恒星還要亮，但只閃燦很短的時間。我們不可把偉大和良善兩個　類混在一起。一七七零年至一八七零年中間，有三個入是變動歐洲的局面的：弗理德力克大帝，拿坡崙，俾士麥克。許多讀史的人，都爲他們的光彩所矇蔽。實在，他們的偉大並不能掩蓋他們　罪惡。世界上如果沒有他們，要好得多。我說這話，並不是厭惡政治。政治的力量和公正，並不是勢不兩立的。美國的林肯，亦生在這個時期中；但他是合偉大和良善在一身的，他是模範的政治家，他是我們個個人所當效法的。</p>

<h3>「甘肅考古」</h3>
<p>— 裴文中博士講北大史學會記</p>
<p>大夏河流域　　當仰韶文化極盛的時候，這種文化亦曾傳佈到這一區域。惟這區域中有另一種文化，就是用安特生先生的「齊家期」，我改爲的「齊家文化」。安特生先生以爲齊家期是彩陶文化最早之一期，但據我們這次觀察的結果，我認為齊家是另一系統的文化，發達在大夏河流域，極盛時期曾達到洮河流域。齊家文化所佔的時間甚長，較彩陶文化，或出現同時。齊家文化似曾受細石器（Microlithic）文化之影響。細小石器及篦紋陶（Combceramics）的存在，是受細石器文化影響的證明。</p>
<p>三，帶回來的問題</p>
<p>我們這次在甘肅，經過五個月的野外考査，只帶回了許多問題，談不上已有什麼發現，我們希望將來能够繼續工作，好解決這許多問題。我現在只舉幾個大的問題，同大家談談。</p>
<p>（一）彩陶文化之發源問題</p>
<p>彩陶文化在河南山西陝西境內均有發見，比次在甘肅境內也見有極盛的彩陶文化。究竟彩陶文化是發源於河南？或發源於甘肅？這是前入爭論，而未能解決的問題。這次我們走了甘肅一次，仍把這個問題帶回來，依然沒有解決。至與國外彩陶文化，如中亞者，歐洲者的關係，自然更無法談起</p>
<p>（二）中國文化起源問題</p>
<p>中國文化是怎樣發生出來的？我們現在尙不知道。我們只知道：有一個殷文化（即小屯文化），周滅股，再傳至漢，中國文華的特性具備，發達最盛。在我此次所經過的四個區域中，我們可以看出，漢代文化代替了其他較早的任何文化。殷文化是不是中國文化，是一個問題，殷以前的中國文化如何？更是一個無從談起的問題。我曾說：在渭河上游，彩陶文化之所以衰落，是受了「原始的中國文化」的影響，就是說，原始的中國文化，在渭河上游，代彩陶文化而興起。所謂的「原始的中國文化」是一個假定的名詞。代彩陶文化而興起的文化，是不是可以算中國文化，實在尙屬問題多端。如果我們能解決了道個問題，距我們解決中國文化起源的間題，則近了一步。每決這許多相關連的問題，尙待我們今後的努力。</p>
<p>（三）周民族文化的問題</p>
<p>據古籍記載，周民族來自西方，在謂河下流，發達起來，更東進而滅殷，惟今日我們所知周初的文化，幾乎全係承襲殷文化而來。周是一個民族，在滅殷之前，秘有它本身的文化。如果周民族確由西方而來，則必來自渭河上流。我們這次在渭河上流考查所得，彩陶文化之衰落期，就時代上講，約相當於周民族居住在那裏的時代。衰落後的彩陶文化，是不是周民族的本身固有文化？是一個很個得硏究的問題，可惜我們今年的工作，沒有解決了這個問題。我們把它帶回來，請大家來解決。</p>
<p>（四）石灰住室問題</p>
<p>此次在甘肅旅行，起初看見薄石灰層，後來試　了幾處。在洮河流域的一個地方，開掘的結果，發見這石灰層是方形的，中間爲一圓坑，似燒火之地。在一個石灰層裏，掘得四個粗繩紋陶器及一個三足陶鬲。又發見一女人及二幼童之遺體。由種種方面觀察，這石灰層是古代人　住室內所鋪的室地，其年代約相當於彩陶文化衰落的時期，最晚亦在漢前。至此住室與渭河下流及河南等地者之關係若何？此住屋之確實年代若何？此住室之上部及其門戶若何？均待我們將來解決。</p>
<p>（五）安特生先生各分期問題</p>
<p>我們這次在甘肅觀察的結果，覺得安特生先生的分期，也有相當問題。第一是安先生的「齊家期」，安先生因爲這一期中彩陶極少，故以爲這是彩陶文化最早的一期。據我們這次所貝，所謂齊家期的遺址，在大夏河流域分佈甚廣，發達甚麽。我個人以爲齊家期代表另一種文化，暫時呌作「齊家文化」。這種文化是一個複雜臘（Anphora）式的大耳陶罐，同時又有打擊而成的石器，及細石器。我揣測齊家文化是另一系統的文化，與彩陶文化之孰為先後，現尙不知。很奇怪。安先生的「辛店期」，在渭河上流則沒有。</p>
<p>至安生的「寺　期」，我們這次所遇見的，只有墓葬，未發見住地。這一期廢於彩陶文化系統，抑或屬於齊家文化系統？與石灰住室有無關係？現時均無法斷定。</p>
<p>總結我們這次在甘肅的考古工作，並沒有解決了問題，而是帶回了許多問題，求大家同我們共同解決。現在解決不了，我們應當繼續工作下去，以求將來有解決之一日。我們從事於學術工作，不能希望快而有結果。例如我們這次用了幾個月的工夫，走了很有限的路程，不會有什麼結果的。但是我們能够帶回許多問題來，能够同大家談一談，在學術研究上說，也可以說不虛此行了。（續完）</p>
<h3>談佛典翻譯文學（中）</h3>
<p>— 周一良</p>
<p>第二個觀點是把翻譯佛典當寓言，故事，這一類通俗文學來看，我們知道印度是全世界許多寓言童話的發源地，佛家經典裏吸收了不少這種故事，又輾轉傳譯到中國。中國許多故事神話，都是受了翻譯佛典的影響而產生的。最膾炙人口的如同西游記玄奘的三個弟子—孫悟空，猪八戒和沙和尙，都有印度原型，陳寅條先生早已指出。（西游記玄奘弟子故事之演變，載中硏院史語所集刋第二本第二分）再早一點，如敦煌所出的通俗文學作品—變文，也有許多是利用佛經裏的題材作成的。更溯上去，像六朝的志怪小說，其中大部分多多少少也都是佛典影饗下的產品。所以，要談比文學佛典固是寳藏，要硏究中國通俗文學的源流演變，佛典也是不可缺少的一個通鎖。</p>
<p>巴利文佛典以本生經中寓言最多，漢譯佛典中，也以生經六度集經等所收爲集大成。我現在舉一個例。這個寓言的梵文木見於五卷書Pancatantra。漢譯佛典則吳康僧會譯六度集經，西晋竺法護譯生經和侑　那崛多譯佛本行集經裏都有同樣的記載。我這兒舉生經的本子作代表，因爲它在三者之中寫得最好。不僅有敎訓的意義而已，並且充滿機智，幽默和人情味。原文是這樣：</p>
<p>乃往過去無數刧時，有一獮猴王。處在林樹，食果飲水。　念一切妓行喘息人物之類，皆欲令度，使至無爲。時與一　以爲知友。親親相敬，初不相忤。　數往來到獮猴所。飲食言談，說正義理。其婦見之數出不在，謂之於外淫蕩不節。即問夫　：「卿數出，爲何所至凑？將無於外放逸無道？」其夫答曰：「吾與獮猴結爲親友。聰明智　，又曉義理。出輒往造，共論經法，但說快事，無他放逸。」其婦不信，謂為不然。又瞋獮猴誘述我夫，數令出入，常圖殺之，吾夫乃休。因便佯病，困劣著床。其　瞻勞，醫藥療治。竟不肯差。謂其夫言：「何須勞意損其醫藥？吾病甚重，當得卿所親親獮猴之肝，吾乃活耳。」其夫答曰：「是吾親友。寄身託命，終不相疑。云何相圖，用以活卿耶？」其婦答曰：「今爲夫婦，同共一體。不念相濟，反爲獮猴，誠非誼理。」其夫逼婦，又敬重之，往請獮猴：「吾數往來到君所頓。仁不枉屈詣我家門。今欲相請到舍小食。」獮猴答曰：「吾處陸地，卿在水中。安得相從？」其鼈答曰：「吾當負卿，亦可枉儀！」獮猴便從。負到中道，謂關猴言：一仁欲知不？所以相講，吾婦病困，欲得仁肝，服食除病。」獮猴報曰：「卿何以故不早相語？吾肝掛樹，不齎持來。促還取肝，乃相從耳。」便還樹上，跳跟歡喜，時鼈問曰：「卿當　肝來到我家。反更上樹，跳跟踴躍，爲何所施？」獮猴答曰：「天下至愚無過於卿！何所有肝而掛在樹？共爲親友，寄身託命。而還相圖，欲危我命？從今已往，各自別行！」</p>
<p>這段裏的「仁」是第二人稱的尊稱，是「仁者」的省略，「至凑」「親親」也都早期翻譯佛典裏常見的語彙。</p>
<p>寓言之外佛典中還有不少好的故事，主要的結集有支謙譯撰集百橡經，比魏慧覺等譯賢愚經，比魏吉迦夜曇　共譯雜賓藏經等，而義凈所譯根本說一切有部律裏長篇而且內容複雜的故事尤多，這些故事的梵文原本，只有幾個avadana的結集存在。最近聽說迦濕迷耳發現有部律的梵文本，將來印出後，對於硏究這些故事定要增加不少寳貴的材料。可惜故事都太長，不能徵引。我只撮要舉一個來作例。這故事也見於生經，但根本說一切有部毘奈耶破僧事卷一二所載文詞和構造都比較好些，所以我就用義淨的譯文，是講織師的舅舅和外甥一同作賊的事：</p>
<p>織師所得恣意有餘。外甥問舅：「我今與舅同作一業，何故舅室恒得充饒，而我家中每不支濟？」舅報外甥：「我作二業，汝即爲一」。外甥問舅：「第二業何？」彼便報曰：「我夜竊盜」。外甥白言：「我亦隨盜」。舅即報曰：「汝不能盜」。答曰：「我甚能作」！　作是念：「我且先試」。你是念已，便共向市。舅買一兎，使令料理：「我暫洗浴，即來當食」。彼料理已，舅未至間，便食一脚。舅洗浴回，問其外甥：「料理竟不」？答曰：「已了」。舅曰：「料理旣竟，將來我看」！外甥擎兎過與其舅。舅見其兎遂少一脚。問外甥曰：「兎第四脚今在何處」？外甥報曰：一其兎本來有此三脚。云何問我索第四耶」？舅作是念：「我先是賊，今此外甥大賊勝我」。……即與外甥於夜分中穿他牆壁，擬盜財物。旣穿孔己，其舅即先將頭欲入孔中。外甥吿曰：「舅不閑盜法！如何先以己頭入於孔中？此事不善，應先以脚入孔。若先以頭入，被他割頭，衆人共識，禍及一族。今應先以脚入」。舅聞是己，便以脚入。財主旣覺，便即唱賊。衆人聞聲，即共於內孔中捉其賊脚。爾時外甥復於孔外挽出其舅。力旣不禁，恐禍及己，即截其頭持己而走。于於君臣奏王此事。王吿羣臣：「截頭去奢最是大賊！汝可將彼賊尸置四衢中，密加窺覘。或有悲泣將尸去者，此是彼賊，便可捉取」。羣臣奉命，即將死尸如王設法。彼賊外甥便思念云：「我今不應直抱舅尸，恐衆人識我！我應佯狂於諸四衢，或抱男女，或抱樹石，或抱牛馬，或抱猪狗」。是念己，便行其事。時世間人旣見其人處處抱物，咸知是狂。然賊外甥始抱其舅，盡哀悲泣，便即而去。羣臣奏王，皆曰：「守尸，唯一狂人抱月哀泣而去，更無餘人。王便吿曰：「彼是狗賊，如何不捉」？………爾時彼　復作是念：「我今如何不葬我　？我必須葬」！便作一駕車人，滿着柴束，驅至尸上。速解牛絡，放火燒車。便走而去。當爾之時車柴之火燒尸遂盡。……爾時彼賊復作是念：「我今要須於葬舅尸之處設諸祭祀」。念己，便作凈行婆羅門形，於國城內遍行乞食，即以其食於燒尸處五處安置，陰祭其舅，作己便去。……爾時彼賊復作是念：「我今要將　骨投於彌伽河中」。作是念己，便作一事髑髏外道形，就彼骨所，取其餘灰以塗其身。收取燒骨於髑　中安　。投彌伽河中，作已便去。</p>

<h3>日本人的丟人國策矮簷回憶之二</h3>
<p>「七七」事變的爆發點是在平西蘆溝橋邊的小城（舊時駐西路廳，今為宛平縣治），日軍在附近演習，說收隊點名時，「丟了一個人」，說「代為尋覓」，皆不允，非進城證明他們「他們」不可。守軍責任所在，認為外兵隨便搜城，是大恥辱，決意抵抗，雙方開火，引起全面戰爭，茶毒中華國土，掠奪殘害中華人民，又發動太平洋戰爭，最後一敗塗地，至一九四五之八月接受波次坦宣言，全面投降。由趾高氣揚而低頭下氣，可眞「丟了人」了。</p>
<p>日本藉口「丟人」尋眾，非止一次（北平話謂之「找碴兒」，蘇白謂之「扳差頭」存心搗亂也），即如「九一八」之事，亦以「中村失蹤」措詞，而向北大營開砲。即上海方面「一二八」以至「八一三」，幾乎無次不以「丟人」為口實。</p>
<p>民國二十三年六月，南京日本副領事藏本忽然不見。日使與日政府又借題發揮，危詞嚇詐。汪精衛時在行政院長任，驚惶失措，下令懸重賞，各處搜查，結果在市郊僻靜處山洞裏發現了，原因是他悲觀厭世，郤對於其國之「丟人」國策，大開玩笑。汪氏趕緊派人護送到日使館，使館甚難為情，以「辱國」罪名，遣送回國。其實藏本個小事，無所謂「辱國」，惟日方恫嚇示威，結果一塲沒趣，國際騰笑，實在有點「丟人」！</p>
<h3>智能</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>司法重證據，證據確鑿，使人服罪而無怨，否則，即犯人首服（犯者固，而旁觀終不明所以，難以昭信也。然證據之搜求，誠非易事。王東漵柳南隨筆載：「時敏，字子求，常熟人，嘗知固始縣，有二鄉人入城，維舟一處，一為賣米者，一為賣菜子者，爭一栲栳，至相撲擊，其栲楮本賣菜子者物也，遂訟於官。子求乃宣言於眾曰：「此事不必審人，即審栲栳足矣。」於是命隸取栲栳杖之，時觀者如堵，不解所以，迨杖下而栳栲破，有菜子自縫中滾出，賣米者乃叩顙服罪。一時頌為神明。」又「吳縣人盛玉贊者，嘗為蘭谿知縣，有兩氏爭一犢成訟，盛乃使牽兩母牛置於旁，而　其掠其犢，一母牛作　觫狀，遂得寶，歸其主」。其明察與時略同，葢皆理解力精密所致也。又陸以湉冷廬雜識引載富陽周芸　所述羅思舉提督逸事云：「提督嘗率兵入南山搜餘賊，村人苦猴羣盜食田中作物，每晨必發火器以驚之，提督問故，令獲一猴來，命人薙其毛，以顏色畫其面，為大眼諸醜怪狀，明　俟羣猴來，縱之去，羣猴見之，皆驚走。猴故其羣也，不知彼所以驚走之意，而尚以為棄已，恐再被執，緊追不舍，羣猴益驚，越山數十重，後遂不復至。人皆服其智。」此事雖與上述二者不同，要皆以理解力勝則一也，故拉雜錄之。</p>
<h3>瓷部消息</h3>
<p>— 周敬庠</p>
<p>凌霄漢閣主在本刊談到了景德鎭的「瓷」，頗為沒有全燬而欣慰，筆者旅居贛省數月，雖然對於「瓷」全外行，可是欣賞「瓷」的興趣很高，問常沒事，總在各瓷器店細的觀摩，跟業中人瞎談，略述一二，料為關心所樂聞。</p>
<p>景德鎭在勝利後雖添設了勝利窑，可是勝利窑的出品並不多，其中以創造的勝利茶壺，總算以新穎而頗受歡迎，茶壺嘴下端的二側，有凸印的圓形勝利二字，這算是勝利窑的代表作，也算是「瓷都」給勝利紀念的一種產物。</p>
<p>景德鎭雖有「瓷都」的尊號，可是實際上只是一個貧苦的手工業區，當地人自稱為「草鞋頭，」因為十之七八都穿草鞋。顧名思義，也該知貧苦的程度了。目下產業工人只有戰前的三分之一，一般　主的資本都不够充實，所以產量日見减少。</p>
<p>精緻的細瓷，現在出品很少，仿古的作品也漸見稀少。通常以光胎加以細繪，算是上品了。畫瓷的人材，後繼亦稀，目下以張志湯畫馬，劉雨岑畫竹，算是畫瓷的名家，此外鄒侯文的山水，熊夢渭的花卉，也都是有名的老作家。</p>
<p>一把名畫的茶壺，市價十餘萬，小品的五件文具，須要二十萬。近二個月來漲起了二倍多，一桌的細瓷餐具，要一千多萬，普通的也要五六百萬。瓷業中人對於瓷價認為還便宜，他們說：要是跟彩色顏料作比，瓷價的漲度，纔眞差遠呢！這也是實情。</p>
<p>九江現在是瓷器的集散地，瓷器店次鱗櫛比，大都有三步一店，五步一家之慨，都陳列了新異的花樣，來招引路人，看了有些眼花撩亂。每一艘輪船停靠九江，多少總背了些瓷器出去，不過背走的都屬中等以下的瓷器，細瓷的銷路較呆些。</p>
<p>眞的舊瓷已很少，只有一家華昌瓷店還有陳列。瓷的人像，像福祿壽三星，關公，濟顛，觀音等塑像，以光華的出品為最精，小件的畫瓷，要算立生磁店最多最精緻。因為瓷店多，所以生意也分散了，顯得還是不景氣。眼前水道淺個，景德鎭的貨，運來很受阻碍，用人力走陸路挑，每担要五十萬挑力，所以成本愈來愈貴了。</p>
<p>江西的瓷業還在黯淡過程中，現在亟須要輸血强心，才能繁榮·同時，質的改進，和技工的再訓練，也是很急切需要的。因為　工們的守舊性很深，缺少新的科學技術，因此很多人想起了我們的瓷業專家杜重遠先生，他具有改革「瓷都」的決心，為了抗戰，打碎了整個革新計劃，並且在遼遠的魔堂中犧牲了生命，不僅國家短少了一員專門人才，也是江西瓷業的一大損失！（寄自九江）</p>
<h3>論减低學生負担</h3>
<p>— 惕齋</p>
<p>前兩天各報都刊載了敎育部決定修改中學課程標準，以减輕學生負担的消息。大約主要科目如國算英等將酌减，英文每週不過三四時，數學亦在五時以下云云。這自然是敎育界一件值得討論的事，雖然，到今天還未曾見到有何意見。</p>
<p>减輕學生負担的呼聲，戰前就有了，第一個是提出的是陳衡哲女士，在大公報星期論文中發揮他的學生負担過重論，例證是他自己的孩子。到抗戰軍與，課程標準（以廿五年的為根據）曾經修改，其主要趨向，除增加抗戰技術課程如軍訓看護之類外，學科時數，都是减低的，可以說陳女士的主張已見諸實行。</p>
<p>為了第二代青年的身體健康，我們絕不反對减少他們精神上的負重。然而這裏我們感覺到有許多問題，似乎必須連帶解決，否則負担雖然减輕，好處恐怕是沒有。</p>
<p>按照敎育部的意旨，正課雖减少；但要在課外多增自學時間，即所謂自學輔導是。自學輔導這一名詞，在中國敎育界流行，亦已有年，但眞能辦到自學而雙加以輔導者有幾，恐怕只有上帝曉得。自學輔導的先決條件是設備人才，以上海市數百個公私中學而論，有完備充實的圖書館和實驗室的有幾？敎員人選，眞能盡到輔導的責任而且有輔導能力者有幾？殊覺不無疑問。</p>
<p>從前是林語堂曾做過一篇關於自學的文章，他主張大學不必花那麼多錢聘請講師，敎授，而把這筆經費來擴充圖書館，一個大學生應該有利用圖書自己增加知識的本領，蹩脚敎授尸位素餐還不如够程度的學生多讀幾本書好。這話誠然不錯，而且，我想在敎育的進程上說不定會眞有這麼一天，譬如今日之函授學校等，何嘗不是此意？唯在目前，最難的就是怎樣可以有這麼一筆錢來買這許多書，公立學校經費是有限的，私立學校不必談，有錢也不來幹這個。學生除了國文課本英文課本三Ｓ幾何之外，腦袋幾乎是空的，巴不得一聲下課，大家向電影院蜂擁而去（電影亦是敎育，然在上海就很難說），下焉者跳舞塲，越劇塲也是他們消磨時間唯一塲所，做先生的舌敝唇焦講了半天，還是一個胡裏胡塗，若是索性不講，結果如何，大約也就不必再講。每年各大學招生，都有人致慨於學生程度之低落，是學生自己要低落嗎？是因為功課多了負担重而低落嗎？我想不該把罪惡都放在學生頭上，若使我在這個時期，上這種空無一物的「學店」，除程度低落外，恐怕也沒有別的路可走。</p>
<p>大學敎授去作官，中學敎師遞升上去，同理，今日的中學敎師也有若干成問題。可是能怨他們嗎？薪水低，不能維持生活，不用說根本程度資歷不够，即使够，誰又有心思好好敎書？誰又能够有進修的閒暇？敎師如此，設備如此，專門减輕學生負担就會有效果？</p>
<p>可是，在當前環境下，我們有什麼資格要求充實設備和提高敎師素質？</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第五章　飛來橫禍　（二六）</p>
<p>綺紈給渚齊這幾句話，深深打入心坎裏，覺得別人所不能原諒，他竟能原諒，自己說不出的苦處，他竟能完全代為說出，眞是平生第一知已！這時心上受到極度感觸，雙手抱住渚齊手臂，一個臉伏在他手背上，鳴鳴哭了！渚齊心裏也覺得難過，勸道「你別哭呀，身體要緊！」綺紈愈想愈傷心，那能忍得住，足哭了一氣，把平日所受刺激，所蘊存的積　，所受委曲，由這一塲大哭之下，全發洩盡了，才覺心頭略為一舒，拭着眼淚道：「我的苦心，也祇有你能了解，就是我父親，我母親，我哥哥，全不知道，別人更不用說了。我這次吃虧，若給他們知道，只怕還要譏笑我，我實在無顏回去。」渚齊道：「這已經是過去的事，你不要再提，你養好傷回去，誰能知道！就知道也只認你翻車受傷。請寬心吧，一個人多一番經騐，增長一番閱歷，現在社會人心，是如此險惡，尤其是你們小姐們，天眞爛縵，那知道人心是這樣壞？你今天總算是不幸之幸！」綺紈見渚齊語語體貼入微，竟稱她「小姐」，足見他心裏對她是如何尊重，沒有一絲兒輕視。當認識他的時候，目中祇認他是一個美男子，和他談話後，也祇知道他這人很誠實，不是浮薄子弟，到現在更看出他是一個肫摯，熱心，見義勇為，並且能深切知道女子心理的男子，這種人，目中是少見的了，祇可惜他已經使君有婦！綺紈感激欽慕交織之中，口裏雖然沒說出一句感謝話，可是兩眼含情脉脉，感激，欽慕的情緒，已流露言外。二人又款談一會，渚齊一看腕上手表，已指十二點鐘，時間不早，勸綺紈早些安歇，辭了回去。自此每天渚齊有工夫，便抽空來醫院看視，一連數日，綺紈家裏人，和外界戚友，都知道綺紈因翻車在醫院養傷，至其他一切，完全不知道。綺紈在醫院，每日只盼望渚齊早來談話，覺得和渚齊談談說說，比什麼都愉快。經過一星期，綺紈臉上手臂上的傷已漸漸好了，渚齊奉總行使命，到天津分行調查業務，前來告別。綺紈一聽渚齊要遠出，雖然為期很短，心裏也覺黯然。自渚齊赴天津後，每隔兩三天，便接到綺紈一封信，報告他傷痕痊愈，報告他出醫院回家，並希望他能早日回來。渚齊因業務纏身，有時間便回她的信，沒有時間便把信擱下，最後接到綺紈一封快信，希望他即日能回北平再圖一面，遲了不能等待，原來她也要離平他往了。（本章完）</p>

<h3>談美國雜誌</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>自從勝利以來，上海就發現了許許多多的「美式配備」，其中之一，就是熱門街頭電影院左近的美國雜誌攤，花花綠綠的佈滿一大塊地方，有幾種如讀者文摘皇冠雜誌生活畫報，高高的一大堆，足見銷路之不壞。我不知道每種時髦的美國雜誌在上海能銷行若干，但歡乎擁頭之多，備貨之豐，恐怕和普通的中國雜誌比較起來，未必遜色多少。</p>
<p>這是值得玩味的現象。上海說起來是國際都市，現在却是「美式配備」都市了。以雜誌而論，英國雜誌的文字雖和美國雜誌的如雙生子，在攤頭上就已踏破鐵鞋無覓處，更不要說俄文法文雜誌了。今日的美國在海陸空軍或其他按術科學上即使較勝於英國，但別的地方為敎育藝文上英國未必遜於美國，中國人旣然一樣能讀英文，何以羣趨美國的英文雜誌而瞧不起英國的？</p>
<p>俄法文雜誌之少，當然由於中國人懂俄法文者之希。何以希？自是中國中小學之只有英文科而無俄法文科的一定結果。中國敎育當局與敎育界提倡英文敎育，公立的中心小學四年級就有英文科了，帶點敎會學校色彩的私立小學，則二年級就敎ＡＢＣＤ。曾有一位英語專家對我說：我人學英文至遲不能過八歲。問其故。我的幾個小孩都是八歲以前就在學校讀起英文來，發音空間準備與否，因我讀英文時已經四十八歲，不得而知，但無論如何我的小孩的國語發音却都不準確，連鄉音亦已了不少，這是失之國文收之英文，還是駝子跌觔斗，兩頭勿着實呢？我不得而知之。</p>
<p>但英化敎育的效果總算有了，這就是美國雜誌的銷路日見增加。讀者文摘聽說有外文版，如法文版，西班牙文版，日文版等，我會疑問何以沒有中文版，現在歡乎其原版的暢銷上海，始悟中國的知識階級旣已成了英文階級，自然何必勞民傷財的譯成中文！</p>
<p>不過中國人之愛讀美國雜誌，却也頗有理由，一般美國雜誌的內容和中國雜誌的有其不同，簡而言之，前者着重人生，後都着重天下與國家，誰是誰非，不易論定，但如有人願多讀貼切人生之作，而不歡迎治國平天下之言，則其愛看談人生的美國雜誌，原屬自然之理，未可與月亮也是美國的好之徒並論也。</p>
<h3>光明禮讚</h3>
<p>— 白蕪文　龍生畫</p>
<p>說來其實是幼稚可笑的，在重慶住了將近三千個黑夜，而把這六分之一的生命，是消耗在半明不滅的菜洞桐油所發的光燄下的。</p>
<p>像一個天地嚮爆竹一樣，一聽到勝利之聲，心上輕輕一點便爆裂開來，孩子似的聞來，一進城，便把「亮油燈」，植物油燈，電石燈，美孚燈，一古腦兒砸得粉碎；為光明慶祝，向黑暗洩憤：啊！不再在這憐火下寫字，苦吟！啊！不再在作秋墳唱詩的鬼了！</p>
<p>這並不是我稚氣到夢想一朝勝利，重慶電力廠的新機器，便立刻從海外飛來，發十萬瓩電，補償我八年來未老眼昏花的損失。不可能！但這估計我是有的：若干機關，若干人口，若干戰時工廠東歸之後，將省去多少電力，一個作為首都的地方的消耗量，轉移為一個普通城市之光，無論如何不會再「停電」了．</p>
<p>兩年以來，受到妻的十二次以上的抱怨倒不由於打碎了油燈，而是千不該萬不該把兩箱「魚燭」（註：這是重慶名詞，源於鯨油）換了香烟吃，化為裊裊青烟了。</p>
<p>在東北，練習打槍的限力是黑夜燃一要香，插在若干米以外，逐漸移遠，瞄凖了打中香頭火苗，不停電的日子，一百燭光的電燈便有此訓練眼力之功。光在依稀有無之彰，倘要把它形象化，最好備用批評宋詞的成語：「意到筆不到」。倘再通俗一點，便是江南冬夜，老嫗不寐，起坐閒撥手爐里的炭基光景，您總該體會到這「意境」了吧？</p>
<p>除每週兩次固定分區停電以外，有時突然熄滅，謂之臨時停電，滿城的人便如蟻羣被頑童吐了一口唾沫，立刻手忙脚亂，騷動起來，爭向小舖子買燭打油。說是蟻羣，一點出不誇張，往往黑巷之中，「兩蟻」相觸，一聲不響，便似會意，各走各的路，決不會爭吵。</p>
<p>昨晚在一個新聞專校授夜課，電燈突然熄了，我立在高高的講台上，看學生和工友七手八脚的點了一排白燭在案前，我便阿Ｑ似的有點飄飄然，恍惚我已登了祭壇——成為天使了，特別是電燈恢復後在我頭頂上縹緲地加了一圈（！）神光。</p>

<h3>President Personally Presides Over the State Council Meeting: General Budget Re-submitted for Review; Postal and Telecommunications Price Increases Maintained; Sent to the Legislative Yuan to Complete Procedures; Salt Tax Increase Implemented on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The State Council meeting on the 26th discussed seven important cases. The details are as follows: The central government budget for the first half of the 37th year of the Republic of China has been decided to be re-submitted for review. The key points for the research of the committee on the adjustment plan for the treatment of civil and military personnel have been resolved to be re-submitted for review. The national salt tax increase will be implemented from January 1st of the following year. The implementation measures for setting up a temporary additional tax on customs duties have been passed. The case regarding the authority to increase postal and telecommunications prices has been resolved to be sent to the Legislative Yuan according to the original proposal. The supplementary election regulations have been passed according to the original review opinions. The request to increase the number of Manchu legislators and supervisors has been resolved to be passed, with 15 legislators and 8 supervisors. However, it is still subject to review and can only be implemented after legislative procedures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The central government's general budget for the first half of the 37th year of the Republic of China, after being submitted by the responsible authorities, was not approved by the State Council due to the large deficit in revenue and expenditure. It was decided that the civil servant treatment case submitted at the same time would be jointly submitted to a special review committee composed of the presidents of the five yuan, the director of budget, the minister of finance, and government officials Wang Yunwu, Yu Jiaju, Ji Yiqiao, Weng Wenhao, and Chen Huide for further review. During the meeting on the 26th, Budget Director Xu Kan, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, Premier Zhang Qun, and Deputy Premier Wang Yunwu, among others, gave lengthy reports on the compilation process of the above two cases. The meeting was temporarily adjourned. Some committee members believed that the current national financial difficulties require that the budget revenue and expenditure should strive for balance, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and reduce personnel and simplify administration, which is the fundamental way to be diligent in governing the country. President Chiang personally attended and presided over the State Council meeting today and gave instructions on the national budget issue.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The budget for the first half of the 37th year of the Republic of China totals 902,264.549 billion yuan, an increase of 200 billion compared to the total national budget for the entire 36th year of the Republic of China. The case has been resolved to be re-submitted for review.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] It is reported that the biggest feature of the national general budget for the first half of the 37th year is the establishment of fees. For example, the expenses of the Ministry of Communications, the Resources Commission, etc., have increased compared to the past, and it is mainly based on the Constitution to increase the education, science, and culture budget to 15% of the total amount. As for the salaries of public officials, because it has not yet been decided, it will be listed under the second reserve fund. As for the revenue sector, the main sources are still expected to be tax revenue, state-owned enterprise income, Japanese reparations in kind, and debts.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The issue of adjusting the treatment of public and education personnel was brought up for discussion at the State Council meeting on the 26th. After two hours of meticulous discussion, no conclusion was reached. When the discussion reached the middle, President Chiang withdrew to another room and immediately handed it over to a special committee for review. After detailed consultations among the five parties, they reconvened to discuss, but in the end, because the issue was too broad, it could not be decided for a while, and it was immediately handed over to a special committee for review. According to what was submitted to the meeting for discussion today, it was the key points studied by the Committee on the Adjustment Plan for the Treatment of Civil and Military Personnel organized by the Directorate General of Budget, and the speeches by Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, etc., all indicated that the national government was bearing too much burden, and some people believed that the distribution of supplies to public and education personnel in the past was inevitably biased and could not be universal. It was also heard that Xu Kan, when speaking at the meeting, believed that rather than disliking the large budget, it would be better to cut redundant institutions and reduce staff, and issue a considerable amount of severance pay so that the salaries of those in office could be adequately paid. However, this statement only expressed his opinion and did not have any specific suggestions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The government has decided to levy a temporary additional tax on import goods at customs, starting from New Year's Day of the 37th year of the Republic of China, temporarily levied for half a year, increasing by 50%. However, cotton, rice, flour, wheat, and coal, which have fixed official prices, are not included in this example. Secondly, gasoline, diesel, and kerosene have also increased import taxes and are not included in this example. All other imported goods are subject to taxation. Furthermore, the matter of increasing postal and telecommunications prices was brought up again at the State Council meeting. It was decided that during this period of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, the State Council, as the highest power organ of the country, has the power to make expedient decisions without first going through the Legislative Yuan, and the Executive Yuan will supplement and send it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The national salt tax increase case has been passed at the State Council meeting on the 26th. It was decided to implement it from New Year's Day of the 37th year of the Republic of China. The ordinary edible salt will be increased to 250,000 yuan per dan, and the earth paste and fishing morning salt will each be increased to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Draft Organization Act of the Presidential Office: The Office of Civil Affairs Drafts the Full Text of 25 Articles, Establishing an Office and a National Policy and Strategic Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The draft Organization Act of the Presidential Office has been prepared by the Office of Civil Affairs of the National Government with reference to the national conditions and practical needs, using the Organization Acts of the Office of Civil Affairs and the Office of Military Affairs as blueprints. It adopts a unified approach, prefixes it with the Office of the President, and establishes political participation and advisory bodies in addition to the Merit Review Committee, setting up two advisory institutions for national policy and strategy, with the aim of assisting the head of state in exercising the powers conferred on the president in the Constitution. As for the original Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Design and Evaluation Office, which were originally under the National Government, they have been transferred to the Executive Yuan. The number of personnel listed, in addition to the necessary organizations for the President to consult and the very few added due to the adoption of a unified approach, are all based on the old system for the personnel of the Office of Civil Affairs and the Office of Military Affairs, with no increases or decreases. This configuration is more professional than the existing organizations of the various units within the National Government. The full text of the draft Organization Act consists of 25 articles, stipulating: The Presidential Office shall have a number of political participants and advisors, who shall be appointed by the President from among highly respected personnel and shall provide opinions to the President on major military and political plans and provide consultation.

<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Fishing Across Borders: Allied Headquarters Has Agreed to Stop It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Regarding the matter of Japanese fishing vessels fishing across borders, the Ministry of Agriculture previously reported based on the reports of the China Fisheries Company that five pairs of iron-hulled hand-operated fishing vessels such as Tokyo Maru, Kujira Maru, and Yeliu Maru, and three iron-hulled trawlers, were fishing in the sea area at 123 degrees 42 minutes east longitude and 30 degrees 27 minutes north latitude, which had indeed crossed beyond the fishing area restricted by the Allied Headquarters and infringed upon our fishing rights. The Ministry then requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the delegation stationed in Japan to make representations to the Allied Headquarters. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now received a telegram from the delegation stationed in Japan stating that after the case was submitted to the Allied Headquarters, the Japanese Fisheries Agency has conducted an investigation and interrogation, and the Allied Headquarters is planning to patrol the eastern waters of the Chinese sea to prevent its recurrence.</p>

<h3>Ambassador to Turkey, Li Dijun, Explains the Features of the New Constitution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 25th Dispatch] On the day when our country began to implement the Constitution, our ambassador to Turkey, Li Dijun, specially published a statement to the Turkish press, saying: "The Chinese government and people, regardless of the cost required, are determined to implement the Constitution from today." The ambassador explained to the Turkish people all the democratic features of the new Constitution, and continued: "In the past 36 years, there has been the destruction of feudal warlords, followed by the invasion of Japan, and now there is the rebellion of the Communist Party. However, the Chinese people have persevered and strived for democracy and finally succeeded." The ambassador said: The Chinese government and people "do not underestimate the hostile forces that are currently preventing the country from being unified and democratic. In fact, the Communist Party is currently trying to overthrow the legitimate government of China by force and trying to impose the most oppressive totalitarian regime on the country. However, under the wise leadership of President Chiang, the Chinese people will surely quell the Communist rebellion, just as they have previously defeated the warlord separatism and crushed the Japanese invaders. They firmly believe that the new Constitution will be fully implemented, and China will be a bastion of democracy in the Far East. Their confidence is not only based on their own inherent strength but also relies on the broad support of all freedom-loving nations in the world, and the Turkish people are also one of them."</p>

<h3>Assets of the China Textile Corporation: Priority Purchase Principle: A Total of Four Items Awaiting Approval from the Executive Yuan Before Implementation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The method for applying for priority purchase of the assets of the China Textile Corporation has been approved by the meeting of the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises and is being reviewed by the National Economic Council. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, it can be announced and implemented. As of now, more than ten units, including Dahua, Yuxing, Daxing Textile Company, Puyi Jingwei Company, Tianjin Huaxin Textile Company, and the Postwar Private Textile Factory Restoration Committee, have applied for priority purchase. The Supervisory Committee has not made any decision on this. The meaning of priority purchase is that, under the same price and the same principles of the Supervisory Committee's sale, manufacturers are allowed to submit evidence based on the facts and reasons they have, and after review by the committee, they are approved to purchase with priority. The principles of priority purchase are: Private textile companies in the rear, which suffered losses during the war due to supplying military needs, may be allowed to purchase with priority depending on the amount of losses caused by supplying military needs, but they must submit evidence from relevant agencies proving the facts and figures of the losses caused by supplying military needs. If the original factory property was forcibly occupied and damaged by the enemy puppets during the occupied period, or if it was forced to sell a part or all of it, and concrete and legal evidentiary documents can be submitted, the committee may review and determine that it is indeed the case, the original factory may be applied for priority purchase, but if the enemy puppets continue to operate after the sale and the increased assets exceed the scope of the original factory assets, or if the enemy puppets merge the two factories and the original assets cannot be subdivided, this is not included. Textile manufacturers who voluntarily sold to the enemy puppets before or during the war cannot request priority to repurchase the original factory property. The request of local governments to operate and sell to private individuals is not in line with the purpose, and it is proposed that according to the above four principles, if the manufacturer is allowed by the committee to purchase with priority, if they fail to comply with the regulations of the committee and pay the factory price to the national treasury within a certain period of time, the priority purchase will be revoked after the deadline.</p>

<h3>Forward to Benevolence and Democracy! - Thoughts on Pope Pius XII's Broadcast Address -</h3>
<p>On the eve of Christmas, Pope Pius XII broadcast to 400 million Catholic believers worldwide, expressing deep concern in his address for the current situation in China. We have not yet had the opportunity to read the full text of the Pope's broadcast, but from the snippets published in the newspapers, it is not difficult to discern the general spirit of the entire address. This spirit is to guide humanity to move forward to benevolence and democracy. Yes, we must overcome hatred with benevolence and overcome totalitarianism with democracy.</p>
<p>Originally, the Pope has a customary broadcast every Christmas. Apart from Catholic followers and various European and American countries, we would not have paid general attention to it. We are neither a Christian nor a Catholic country. The Pope's speech, although a well-rounded, comprehensive article with profound meaning, seems to many people to be somewhat irrelevant to us. This is extremely natural, but this year, the Pope's address directly mentioned China, and based on the existing signs, we really cannot maintain the same indifferent attitude as before. Within Christianity, there is a distinction between Catholicism and Protestantism, and within Protestantism, there are various denominations, but whether they believe in Protestantism or Catholicism, they are all Christian believers who believe in Jesus Christ. The Roman Pope is the spiritual leader revered by 400 million Catholics worldwide. Although various Protestant denominations have different attitudes towards the Roman Pope, given the large number of Catholic believers and the length of history, it would be no exaggeration to say that the Roman Pope is, in fact, the highest leader of Christianity today. Because he is the most exalted leader within Christianity, his every word and deed are of concern to the world, and now even we in China should not ignore them.</p>
<p>Why? In the current world situation, we can clearly see the struggle between Christ and anti-Christ. When we discussed the glorious beginning of constitutionalism the day before yesterday, we said: weighing the overall world situation, if the world is truly divided, this division will definitely not be between East and West, but will be between the Christian world and the anti-Christian world. The forces against Christianity may be able to dominate for a time, but the result will inevitably be failure. The reason is that the forces of Christianity represent democracy, while the forces against Christianity symbolize totalitarianism. In such a world situation, under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, we can already see the direction in which we should move forward in the future. What is this direction? It is to move towards the Christian world, that is, to move towards democracy and freedom, and to oppose totalitarian autocracy. In Chairman Chiang's address to the people of the whole country on the eve of the implementation of the constitution, he clearly pointed out: "The characteristic of our new constitution is that it guarantees to universally grant to our compatriots the basic elements of Christian doctrine, namely, individual dignity and freedom." The implementation of this constitution with Christian doctrine components, and "the year 1947 of the Republic of China, which is the year 1947 of the birth of Jesus, will be the day when the unified, independent, equal, and free new opportunities of our Republic of China and all its people begin." It can be seen that from now on, our country's democratic constitutionalism will be deeply connected with Christianity, which represents the forces of democracy. Only in this way, we should always pay attention to the trends in the Christian world, and not be complacent and refuse to make progress.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are particularly excited to read Pope Pius XII's broadcast, and what comforts us most is the Pope's concern for China. He said: "Europe and the whole world, including distant and wounded China, are further away than before from true peace, complete and certain restoration, and a new order based on the agreement of public opinion. Those who deny and create division are confident that their days are getting closer and closer, while the friends of peace, the promoters of lasting harmony, comparing the spirit of Christ with the difficult situation of today's world far from the spirit of Christ, cannot help but feel deeply saddened. However, the true strength of Christ knows the meaning of the era in which we live better than anyone else. In today's competition between two major forces for the position of master of the world, hatred has a greater attraction for mankind, and all symbols seem to be heading towards division, but the true love of mankind can complete the unity of the world. We hereby issue our heartfelt appeal to those who believe in the true God and peace in the world." The Pope also quoted the famous line from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, re-proposing "To follow Christ or to oppose Christ? That is the question." As we said, the current world situation can be said to be a struggle between Christ and anti-Christ, a struggle between benevolence and hatred, and a struggle between democracy and totalitarianism. At this time, the Pope's re-mention of "To follow Christ or to oppose Christ?" adds a fresh meaning, which is "To follow democracy or to follow totalitarianism?" The root cause of the current world's disturbances and the competition between the two major powers of the United States and the Soviet Union is probably due to this question. Where to go, the Chinese people should be able to judge for themselves!</p>
<p>From the Pope's address, we can see that the ideal of Christianity, moderation and peace, coincides with the Three Principles of the People, which are the foundation of our nation. The true love that the Pope speaks of is our benevolence. Only based on benevolence can the world be united, and "the world as one family" and the ideal of world harmony that we possess can be realized. Hatred may have a greater attraction for mankind, but benevolence will eventually overcome hatred. We take the Three Principles of the People based on benevolence as the highest guiding principle for our nation-building. We are willing to use our strength to devote ourselves to the reconstruction of world peace and order, and at the same time, we hope that Christian countries based on benevolence can have a deeper understanding of the difficulties we are currently facing, and can provide sympathetic assistance in our efforts to quell the rebellion and build the country. If the democratic forces of the world can unite in this way, they will surely be able to prevent the reincarnation of totalitarian forces, and the reconstruction of world peace and order can naturally be expected to be achieved in the shortest possible time. We must overcome hatred with benevolence and overcome totalitarianism with democracy.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan and the United Relief Agency Announce Their Closure - The Two Directors Report on Two Years of Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Huo Baoshu, and the Director of the UNRRA China Office, Cleveland, jointly held their last press conference yesterday before the closure of the two agencies. They delivered speeches on the spot, announcing the closure of the two agencies and briefly reporting on the main work in the past two years. After the two directors finished their speeches, Director Huo also answered various questions from reporters.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of fishing boats by the Fisheries Administration, Director Huo stated that the fishing vessels of the administration have complex equipment and must be used by trained personnel. There are currently a total of 128 ships of various sizes. The general policy of the government is to resell about 60 of them to private fishing companies, but they will not be concentrated in Shanghai. The detailed sales plan will be announced soon. The conditions are quite favorable, with installment payments and a long repayment period. Some of the ships are temporarily kept by the Fisheries Administration because other equipment has not been completed.</p>
<p>Also, the Executive Yuan's Air Transport Brigade will also be closed at the same time as the Executive Yuan, as agreed. However, this brigade has made great contributions to our government and export commodities, and there is a real need for it to continue to exist, so it is currently in contact with the Ministry of Communications. After the closure of the two agencies, the Post-War Affairs Committee will continue to handle fisheries recovery, rural industry, pharmaceutical manufacturing, agricultural machinery and other tasks and various materials. The committee is scheduled for two years.</p>
<p>Regarding past administrative errors and corruption incidents, Huo frankly admitted that the management and system aspects were not thorough, but said: According to the cases handled by the Investigation Department of this agency, it only accounts for 3/1000 of the total number of more than 20,000 employees. Comparatively speaking, it should not be considered too great an error.</p>
<p>Director Cleveland of UNRRA said in his speech that the UNRRA China Office is about to officially close, and this experiment in promoting international cooperation has also come to an end.</p>
<p>About 100,000 tons of UNRRA materials have not yet been completed, including locomotives from Australia and British equipment. At the request of the Chinese government, this office has retained a number of technical personnel to take care of the work, and five foreign personnel have joined the Management Committee. In addition, a special gift of US$5 million was given as foreign exchange expenses to continue the association's program. I plan to stay in China for another month and return home after transferring my duties to the Management Committee.</p>
<p>It is learned that Director Huo has decided to take the post of Director of the Import and Export Management Committee after the closure of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has been approved by the Executive Yuan to close at the end of the year. From January next year, the agency will focus on all clearing work. In the future, relief work will continue to be handled by the Ministry of Social Affairs, and post-war work will be taken over by the newly established Post-War Affairs Committee.</p>

<h3>The Directorate General of Telecommunications Holds - Telecommunications Technology Competition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The 28th of this month is the first Telecommunications Memorial Day in our country. The Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications has specifically held a telecommunications technology competition in Nanjing on this day, with items such as sending and receiving telegrams and telephone switching. The participants in the competition are all outstanding technicians selected from various places. In addition, the bureau hosted reporters on the evening of the 26th to report on the development of the telecommunications industry in our country. The Deputy Director of the Bureau, Qian Qishen, presided over the meeting and briefly stated: Our telecommunications industry has a history of 66 years, which can be divided into four periods. The first is the founding period, from the seventh year of Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. The second is the expansion period, from the establishment of the National Government to the beginning of the War of Resistance. The third is the period of resistance and construction, which is the situation during the eight years of the War of Resistance. The fourth is the period of revival, which refers to the situation after the victory of the War of Resistance and the return to peace. The bureau has formulated a five-year plan for post-war telecommunications construction, the main points of which are that domestic communications are mainly based on wired telegraphs, supplemented by wireless telegraphs, and international communications are mainly based on wireless telegraphs. The construction of the domestic communication network will divide the country into several regions, select a key point in each region as the regional center bureau, and select several key points in each region to establish external regional center bureaus, etc., to establish a national communication network. According to this plan, a total of about 350,000 pairs of kilometers of telegraph and telephone lines, 467,000 telephones in cities, and about 240,000 tons of foreign materials are needed, along with other equipment. More than 90,000 staff are needed, but now due to banditry and military needs, everything cannot be implemented as scheduled, and materials are difficult to obtain, so it is difficult to realize for a while.</p>
<h3>Our Trade Delegation to Japan - Can Arrive in Tokyo in the Middle of Next Month</h3>

<h3>Liu Zhi Talks About His Impressions of Visiting Taiwan - Customs, Habits, and Human Feelings Are No Different From Those in the Mainland - All Circles Unanimously Condemn International Conspirators</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] General Liu Zhi was invited by Chairman Wei Daoming at the beginning of the month to visit Taiwan for more than half a month. He flew from Taiwan to Shanghai by plane a few days ago. Yesterday, reporters went to pay their respects and asked about his impressions of visiting Taiwan. He said: Taiwan is an inherent territory of China. Recently, a few international conspirators have attempted to separate Taiwan from China and arrogantly advocated so-called "self-determination" and "trusteeship." The local public opinion organs and the press in Taiwan Province have all sternly refuted and unanimously criticized them. Based on my on-the-spot observations in Taiwan this time, Taiwan's customs, habits, and human feelings are no different from those in the mainland provinces. The Japanese ruled Taiwan for 51 years and did not achieve the goal of assimilating the Taiwanese people. Most of the Taiwanese people migrated from Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and there are also those who migrated from various provinces in the mainland. For example, in the former Qing Dynasty, thousands of people migrated from Jiangxi. They engaged in various handicrafts in Taiwan. The Japanese ruled Taiwan and adopted a purely colonial policy to establish a base for advancing south and fulfilling their aggressive ambitions. Therefore, the Taiwanese people were treated unequally in politics, education, and economics. All senior government officials were Japanese, and they implemented enslavement in education. The Taiwanese people had few opportunities to receive higher education. For example, out of 3,000 students at Taiwan University, only one-tenth were Taiwanese. In the economy, they squeezed raw materials as much as possible. 70% of the land was taken over by the government and rented to farmers through the hands of local tyrants. After the farmers worked hard to cultivate the land, they had to pay 75% to the government and keep 25% for themselves. After the restoration, it became inversely proportional, so the farmers' lives have been greatly improved. The Taiwanese people were in a state of slavery during the Japanese rule. Now, people's opinion organs at all levels of provinces, cities, and counties have been generally established, and the provincial government can also respect public opinion and strive for good governance. During my stay in Taiwan, I went to Keelung in the far north and Eluanbi in the far south, and visited the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant, the Alishan Logging Area, the Chianan Irrigation Project, the mines, sugar factories, lead factories, oil refineries, and cement factories. I felt that all the constructions were quite grand and arduous, which could not be achieved by the provinces in the mainland. Earthquakes, typhoons, rainstorms, and others are known as the five disasters of Taiwan, but they can still achieve this result, which shows that human effort can overcome nature. According to the Director of the Construction Department, if they use one point of strength in other places for construction, they must use eight points in Taiwan, which shows that if the provinces in the mainland can concentrate their efforts and focus on construction, the results will definitely surpass those in Taiwan Province. During my stay in Taiwan, I was invited to participate in the second anniversary celebration of the establishment of the Chiayi Municipal Government and unveiled the memorial monument to the late Chairman Lin. The late Chairman Lin served as an official in the area in his youth, and the people of Chiayi specially built a monument to commemorate him to show their remembrance.</p>

<h3>Tokyo International Tribunal Packed, War Criminal Tojo on Trial, US Lawyer Reads 60,000-Word Defense, Claiming Japan Acted in Self-Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo appeared at the Far East International Military Tribunal on the afternoon of the 20th for his defense. The audience was exceptionally large, but military police forbade standing for security reasons. At the opening of the court, Tojo's defense lawyer Kiyose delivered an address, calling Tojo a strict disciplinarian who faithfully followed the Emperor's will. He claimed Japan was provoked by the United Nations and fought for self-defense and survival. Tojo would not evade political or administrative responsibility for any actions. The defendant then stepped into the witness box, and his 60,000-word statement was read by his American lawyer, Blakeney. Tojo attempted suicide with a pistol after Japan's surrender but failed and has now fully recovered. He appeared in court in military uniform but without insignia.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 26th] The Tokyo International Military Tribunal concluded its interrogation of former Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo at 3:00 PM on the 26th. From 3:15 PM, the interrogation of former Prime Minister Tojo, who is attracting worldwide attention, began. Anticipating Tojo's interrogation, the audience began arriving in the morning, causing the courtroom to be crowded with almost no space to stand. Former Prime Minister Tojo, without his general's insignia or waist sword, stood in the defendant's seat wearing a light yellow military uniform. News photographers vied to capture this historical moment, with flashes of magnesium lighting creating a grand spectacle. During this time, the sound of Tojo reading his written testimony was constant. The main points of his written testimony totaled seven: Japan did not plan or prepare for war against the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands; the war against the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands was caused by their provocations, and Japan started it out of necessity for self-preservation and self-esteem; the Japanese government completed the procedures with thorough good faith to deliver a legal declaration of war to the United States before initiating the attack; the true meaning of the Greater East Asia was not aggression; there was no such thing as a military clique; the independence of the supreme command and the operation of the Liaison Conference and the Imperial Conference; Tojo's so-called specialty in military administration lay in control and discipline.</p>
<h3>Tojo Accuses Britain and the United States of Aiding China During the War, Making it Impossible for Japan to Resolve the "China Incident"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 26th] Former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, the first Japanese war crime suspect, stated that the United States succeeded in its scheme to force Japan into war in the Pacific. Reports from Japanese intelligence personnel before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor indicated that Britain and the United States were determined to wage war against Japan, forcing Japan to take decisive action.</p>
<p>As Tojo stepped from the war criminal's dock to the witness stand, a confident smile was visible on his gaunt face. The International Tribunal was packed today, as curious spectators wished to see the once powerful Japanese dictator and hear his defense. The reporters' seats, usually half-empty, were also full. The Tojo Cabinet is accused of responsibility for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Tojo denied that the bombing of Pearl Harbor was a premeditated surprise attack. He stated: It is unbelievable to say that Japan deliberately delayed the declaration of war by ambiguous means, thereby enabling this surprise attack to succeed. The facts of the war prove that the United States had prior knowledge of our attack and was prepared. Delaying the declaration of war had no special effect. He also said that Britain and the United States aided the Chinese government, making it impossible for Japan to resolve the "China Incident," and that since Britain and the United States had applied economic pressure on Japan, Japan had no choice but to exercise its absolute right of self-defense to break down the obstacles surrounding Japan. The Japanese government's use of force was out of the need for self-preservation and self-defense, which goes without saying.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 26th] Former Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo, under repeated interrogation at the International Military Tribunal this morning, testified that Japan wanted to use Soviet aid to fight the Allies when Germany was about to collapse in 1945.</p>
<h3>Greek Guerrillas Launch Offensive, Army Chief Goes to the Front to Supervise Battle, Large-Scale Arrests of Communists in Athens</h3>

<p>[Reuters Belgrade, 26th] Markos Vafiades, commander-in-chief of the Greek guerrillas and prime minister of the provisional democratic government, gave a radio address on the 26th, stating that the main goal of the provisional government is to liberate Greek democrats from the shackles of foreign imperialists and their lackeys. The new government will govern the liberated areas according to democratic principles. The provisional government will establish friendly relations with all countries that support the purposes of the United Nations, and will pay particular attention to the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>British Christmas Gift - Trade Agreements to Be Signed Separately with Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] The best gifts from Britain this Christmas and New Year are the trade agreements that have been and will be signed to save US dollars, totaling twelve groups.

<h3>Earth-Penetrating Bombs Destroy Underground Defense Works - Successful Testing by US Military in Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] US Air Force personnel revealed today that they had invented a method of bombing underground defense works during three months of testing in Germany. The US military used 25,000-pound bombs, dropped from high altitude, on German submarine factories near the port of Bremen, bombing the crust and reinforced concrete. The results were completely satisfactory, and the accuracy was better than expected. The German submarine factory had a roof of up to 24 feet thick. More than 40 of the giant bombs and some 100-pound small bombs were used in the test. The giant bombs included 30 "Amazon" and "Samson" 25,000-pound bombs. All the bombs used were not filled with explosives, only to determine their penetration and the strength of the bomb casing. If explosives were loaded, it would endanger nearby residents. Earth-penetrating bombs can generally be loaded with atomic explosives.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Tojo's Defense Statement</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] The main points of Tojo's statement are as follows: "I never expected that the war I waged would be denounced by the victorious countries as an international crime, and that the legal officials of the defeated country would be individually regarded as criminals. As Prime Minister, I believe that there is no escape from guilt, and I am sincerely willing to accept all responsibilities in that regard." Tojo consistently attempted to exonerate the Emperor from responsibility for the war: "There should be no misunderstanding about the true position of the Emperor. In fact, all responsibilities should be borne by the Cabinet and the responsible officers of the General Headquarters." Regarding the failure to warn the United States before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the statement said: The Emperor "repeatedly instructed me and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy to issue a warning before the attack. The Emperor's will was conveyed to the Liaison Conference. I believe in my conscience that the notification of the declaration of war was always transmitted to the United States in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We naturally trusted our diplomatic officials in carrying out such an important matter." Regarding the execution of American and Allied pilots, Tojo admitted to enacting laws concerning prisoners of war, but argued that Japan never ratified the Geneva Convention. "Japan's concept of prisoners of war is different from that of Europe and the United States." Tojo also accused American pilots of violating international law as a justification for Japan's passage of the Prisoner of War Disciplinary Act in 1943: "On April 18, 1942, the pilots led by Doolittle violated international law and regulations and committed atrocities in the Tokyo area, because attacking civilians is a crime under recognized international law." Tojo said that as Minister of the Army, he reduced the death sentences of five of the eight American airmen sentenced to death for bombing Japan. Tojo denied delaying the presentation of US President Roosevelt's last-minute letter to the Emperor. He claimed that when he first heard of the letter, the planes on the mobile task force had already taken off. "Intentionally delaying a letter from the head of state to the Emperor is tantamount to offending the Emperor, and no one in Japan would dare to do this." Tojo described his surprise and hesitation when he first received the order to form a cabinet, but then defended Japan's position, claiming that the "encirclement" of Japan by the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands made it impossible to resolve the "China Incident." Tojo attempted to shift the responsibility for the Tripartite Pact to the late Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, and claimed that Japan's subsequent national policy was not affected by the Pact, especially since Japan was deceived by the superficial amity between Germany and the Soviet Union when negotiating the Pact. Matsuoka later signed a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, but it also lacked practical benefits. Subsequently, after obtaining guarantees of territorial expansion, the Soviet Union agreed to and advanced on Japan while the neutrality treaty was still in effect. Tojo said that Matsuoka's trip to Berlin when negotiating the Tripartite Pact fostered a political prejudice that was indifferent to efforts to seek compromise with the United States. The successive resignations of the Konoe Second Cabinet were also due to Matsuoka's attitude, hoping to oust Matsuoka so that negotiations with the United States and the Allied countries could be completed smoothly. Tojo also said: "The rapid resolution of the China Incident required cutting off cooperation between Chongqing and Great Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in the South. The three countries actively prepared for war in the South, completed the encirclement of Japan, and US senior officials repeatedly made provocative remarks and actions. The strengthening of economic pressure, the obstruction of our access to essential supplies, and the attempts of Great Britain and the United States to unite Vietnam and Thailand all demonstrated hostile actions. After the breakdown of commercial negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, the encirclement was completed." The freezing of Japanese assets in the United States and the British and Dutch having "the closest ties" drove Japanese commerce toward destruction. "We are competing against the two largest countries in the world. The hope of victory is obviously slim, but Japan had no choice but to advance in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, defend important strategic strongholds, occupy areas for military purposes, and do its best to repel enemy attacks. However, the Supreme Command and the Japanese government had no war plans against specific enemies. Our purpose was to prevent war, not to prepare for war." Tojo strongly refuted the notion that the Emperor approved the war, "On November 2, 1941, when the Emperor received two decisive plans, I saw in his expression the grief caused by his love of peace. When listening to our plan, the Emperor was solemn and thoughtful, and then regretted it. 'If we cannot break the deadlock, is there no other way but to fight Great Britain and the United States against our will! I hope you will do your best to overcome the difficulties in the negotiations.'" Tojo said that he "shared the Emperor's anxiety" and had done his best to maintain peace.</p>

<h3>Two Supervisory Commissioners Elected in This City, Tao Baichuan and Yang Hu Elected, More Than Two Hundred City Councilors Solemnly Cast Their Votes, Many Coming Despite Illness or Returning from Afar</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The election of Supervisory Commissioners by the City Council was completed yesterday afternoon. At 6:00 PM that evening, the election supervisor, Mayor Wu, unsealed the ballots and counted them in public. As a result, Tao Baichuan (78 votes) and Yang Hu (68 votes) were elected. Another candidate, Councilor Jin Longzhang of the Democratic Socialist Party, received 51 votes. Councilor Jiang Hao, although he had formally announced his withdrawal from the election, still received three votes. In addition, there were four invalid ballots.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 204 city councilors from various parties in this city went to the City Council on Tanggu Road to vote for the Supervisory Commissioners. The other thirteen councilors were unable to attend due to illness or being out of Shanghai. Mr. Du Yuesheng personally went to the meeting yesterday afternoon, but because the voting booth was located on the third floor of the Council, and Mr. Du's health was not good, with a very high fever, and he could not stand, he was helped by his car to the front of the Council, where voting supervisor Jiang Huaisu waited in front of the car for him to circle his choices, stamp the ballot, and take the ballot. Youth Party Councilor Li Fadao flew back to Shanghai from Guam specifically to vote. Yang Minghui, Mao Jiaju, and Jiang Jizhou also rushed back from Taiwan to vote. Wang Zhuyi was originally nominated as a voting supervisor, but because he was ill and could not stay long, he still voted despite his illness. In addition, Gu Baoyu and Deng Chuankai rushed back from Nanjing, and Cao Ziyan returned to Shanghai from Suzhou, all of which are sufficient to show the enthusiasm and importance attached to the election of Supervisory Commissioners by individual councilors. Furthermore, Xu Shihao was originally scheduled to go to the United States on the 24th, but the departure date was changed to the 26th, and the election was also changed from the 24th to the 26th, so he was able to catch up.</p>
<p>The thirteen councilors who did not vote were Ye Fenghu (in Wenzhou), Wang Zhengting (in Qingdao), Shi Bangfan (in Beiping), Cheng Junguan (in Changzhou), Zhuang Heqi and Cao Jun (in Nanjing), Quan Daoyun (in Hefei), Shen Chunhui, Wu Qiding (sick), Sun Yunjun, Ding Shanming, Zhang Yuliang, and Bao Wenxin (all not in Shanghai).</p>
<p>Voting ended at 5:00 PM. Mayor Wu arrived at the meeting at 5:50 PM. Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Bureau, as well as councilors from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, also arrived successively to observe the counting of ballots. Councilor Tian Shujun and Ms. Yang Hu, daughter of Yang Hu, had arrived early to wait for the counting of ballots. The mood on all sides was quite enthusiastic. During the counting of ballots, in addition to Mayor Wu, Qun Yue, Xu Yongzuo, and Shui Xiangyun served as supervisors. The method of counting ballots involved calling out the votes and marking "正" (zheng, meaning "correct") characters. After the results were announced, Secretary-General Xiang broadcast the results of the ballot counting, and Mayor Wu officially announced the names of the elected Supervisory Commissioners. It is also understood that there are no alternate positions for Supervisory Commissioners.</p>

The founding meeting is scheduled for the 30th.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Speaker Pan Broadcasts to Raise Funds for Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Mrs. Tang Guanyu Pan, the wife of Speaker Pan, was invited by the Shanghai Women's Association to broadcast on the Central Broadcasting Station at 7:00 PM yesterday afternoon, calling on women's circles throughout the city to step up fundraising for winter clothing and cash for winter relief. The following is a transcript of her broadcast speech:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots: The weather is getting colder day by day. As the end of the year approaches and the new year is approaching, the number of refugees on the streets crying out in hunger and cold is also increasing day by day. They come from northern Jiangsu, Anhui, or Shandong. Their hometowns have been harassed and destroyed by the Communist bandits, their fields are barren, and their houses are damaged. Their properties and their jobs have been completely lost, and they have become a group of unemployed people waiting for rescue!</p>
<p>This large group of refugees are also descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and are also citizens of the Republic of China. But while people are celebrating Christmas and the New Year, they have no clothes or food, and they do not know what tomorrow will bring. They are all our compatriots, and they themselves are innocent, but because of the insane Communist bandits who are wandering around and causing chaos, they have suffered indescribable disasters and can no longer live in the bandit areas. At the same time, they are unwilling to obey the Communists' arrangements, so they have to leave their homes and families, and travel thousands of miles to the big city of Shanghai to struggle to survive. Fellow compatriots in Shanghai! Although we also feel that prices are rising and life is difficult, we can still勉强 (miǎn qiǎng, barely, manage to) make a living; moreover, there are still many wealthy families and philanthropists in Shanghai who will sympathize with these thousands of refugees and extend a warm hand to help them.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Shanghai Women's Association has launched, under the call of the Winter Relief Association, to expand our campaign to solicit winter clothing. We are all determined to call on all the ladies and misses in Shanghai in this very short period of time to quickly check the extra cotton clothes and quilts, or other clothes that can keep out the cold, in their own homes, and donate them to Room 320, 3rd Floor, Pudong Native Association, or Shanghai Women's Association at 580 Nanjing West Road, so that they can be sewn and distributed to the refugees in various shelters in batches, so that they can勉强 (miǎn qiǎng, barely, manage to) survive the severe winter. If there are no old clothes or pants, we hope that you will donate cash as much as possible and send it to the Shanghai Women's Association. We will naturally immediately make cotton clothes on your behalf and distribute them to the refugees, for the benefit of all sisters.</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, we Chinese people have always emphasized doing good deeds. The so-called "A family that accumulates virtue will surely have surplus blessings" and "Helping others is the source of happiness" all explain that helping others and helping those in need will definitely bring unparalleled comfort and the children and grandchildren can get great virtue. And in Shanghai, acts of charity and disaster relief have always stood at the forefront of the whole country. Sisters, seeing these many refugees who are shivering in the cold wind, with insufficient clothes to cover themselves and not enough food to eat, especially the plight of women and children, they must all feel unbearable to stand by and let them freeze to death and starve to death. Sincerely hope that you will show your human compassion and actively donate winter clothing or cash, and extend your warm hands to help those refugees who have been persecuted by the Communists and have no home to belong to. "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda!" I am broadcasting this, and I wish all the sisters who are happy to do good deeds!</p>
<h3>·Chennault's Wedding· The President and Mrs. Chiang Send Gifts</h3>

<h3>Student Fundraising ·Coming to a Close</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the students of Tongji University launched a fundraising committee to solicit winter clothing, as of yesterday, a total of more than 7,000 pieces of winter clothing have been distributed, benefiting more than 5,000 refugees. The Association has decided to use the holiday time this Sunday to mobilize all students to expand the fundraising for one day. This work will then come to a close.</p>
<p>Other universities and colleges such as Fudan University, Shanghai Law School, St. John's, Soochow, Dongmei, Shanghai Commercial College, etc., the Municipal Technical College, and Jiaotong University have also successively mobilized or distributed to refugees in various districts, and the progress is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Another Communist Bandit Supply Organization Smashed, More Than Ten Key Criminals Sent to Nantong for Interrogation</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Peng Jiyun's Nantong Fisherman Self-Defense Force seized a bandit transport ship on the 7th of this month in the waters off Lusi Port, confiscating twenty-eight reams of heavy-weight drawing paper used for mapmaking and currency printing, and one hundred and sixty dozen dry batteries. Upon inspecting the identity of the escorts, it was learned that the materials were to be handed over to Zhang Weiqing (alias Chen Yongfu), the general manager of the Jianghai Trading Company of the 9th Military Subdistrict of the Communist bandits in Central China. They were transferred to the military district authorities and confessed that the drawing paper and dry batteries were exchanged for public cotton allocated by the military subdistrict and sold in Shanghai, the person in charge of the transaction was a certain manager of a certain flower shop in Shanghai, and the person responsible was someone from a certain place. The First District Pacification Command dispatched Ji Zhongpeng, a senior colonel section chief from the Second Department, and Zhu Chongwen, a group leader, along with investigators, to Shanghai to investigate. Later, Jiang Huamin, director of the Dead Second Department, was also ordered to come to Shanghai to plan and direct. After Ji Yuchang first consulted with Tao Yishan, director of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters, the No. 6 Water Patrol Team of the department was temporarily used as an office. Captain Feng Zhong of the brigade designated a batch of cadres to assist and complete the deployment. Actions began on the night of the 17th of this month. During the day, more than ten key criminals, including those involved in bandit activities and important merchants, were placed under house arrest. Among the documents seized were two large lists of hundreds of military supplies purchased by the bandits; a portrait of Mao Zedong, and two editions of the bandit's Xinhua Daily newspaper, as well as a large batch of propaganda promoting student unrest. More than two hundred large and small packages of "public cotton" transported from bandit areas, and part of the proceeds, were seized. Director Jiang has sent the related criminals, transcripts of their confessions, and the spoils to the Nantong Headquarters for interrogation and then reported to the Ministry of National Defense for verification.</p>

<h3>Movie Theater Industry Firmly Refuses Auditing, Decides to Automatically Adjust Ticket Prices, Association Official Says Date Around New Year's Day</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Movie theater merchants gathered yesterday to exchange opinions on the issue of movie ticket price increases. According to the association official, since the adjustment of movie ticket prices on September 6, prices have risen again and again, and various expenses are huge, making it impossible to maintain operations. The prices of Peking Opera theaters in this city have been automatically adjusted again and again, and the highest ticket price is now 160,000, about 80,000 times the pre-war price. The prices of other local operas are also more than 50,000 times the pre-war price. However, the current highest ticket price for movie theaters is 25,000 yuan, which is still 12,500 times the pre-war price, and each ticket price adjustment must be approved before it can be implemented, unlike other theaters that can automatically adjust prices as needed. The previous opposition to adding a 20% winter relief donation to the ticket price was because it violated the entertainment tax law. This time, each movie theater requested to adjust the price by one time from December 15, and the Social Affairs Bureau is still reviewing it and has stated that it needs to submit business accounts for verification to confirm a loss before it can approve the price increase. The industry believes that there is no case of operating for personal gain or committing fraud, and there is no basis for this audit, so it firmly refuses. The association official also stated that the increase in movie ticket prices is now no longer "a battle that must be fought for" but "a battle that must be fought." Each movie theater will implement automatic adjustments, and the date should be around New Year's Day. Each theater will "willingly accept punishment" for this move. The industry will convene a general meeting of all members in the next few days to make a formal decision on this matter.</p>
<h3>Electrical Engineering Society Tea Party Welcomes Lu Zongcheng</h3>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers held a tea party yesterday afternoon at the Water Hotel to welcome Lu Zongcheng, the Chinese representative to the International Telecommunications Conference, who returned from the United States. Zhao Zengjue, chairman of the association, attended the meeting. More than fifty members, including Zhuang Zhongwen, Li Ximou, Li Kaidi, and Yu Bingjian, were also in attendance. Zhao delivered an introductory speech praising Lu's success in attending the conference.</p>
<h3>Shen Siliang Released from Prison</h3>
<p>Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison for treason years ago. He has now served his sentence and was released from prison at nine o'clock yesterday morning. However, Shen Siliang's appeal to the Supreme Court against the sentence has not yet been answered.</p>
<p>Suicide… The Night Before</p>
<p>On Christmas Day the day before yesterday, Miss Zhu was exceptionally excited, purchasing a large batch of candies to distribute to her colleagues. Yesterday afternoon, she invited friends to have dinner together and personally cooked the dishes. After the meal, they went to a dance hall together and chatted and laughed as usual, only jokingly telling her friends in the dance hall, "Let's have fun together here tonight. Tomorrow I will be leaving." When asked where she was going, she said, "To heaven." Everyone thought she was going to Hangzhou to see her mother because her home was there, so they didn't investigate further. It wasn't until midnight that her friends sent her back to her dormitory. Another colleague, Pan Yiping, who shared a room with Zhu, happened to have taken leave to go to Nanjing the day before, giving Zhu a chance to commit suicide at her leisure.</p>
<p>Discovery… Too Late</p>
<p>It wasn't until around six o'clock yesterday morning that Pan returned from Nanjing and saw that the dormitory door was tightly closed. She pulled it open, but it wasn't locked. As soon as Pan entered the room, she smelled a strong Lysol odor. Zhu, seeing Pan enter, suddenly jumped up from the bed, rushed out the door, and began to vomit. Seeing this, Pan knew something was wrong and discovered an empty Lysol bottle on the table. She shouted for her colleagues in the next room. After a flurry of activity, she was rushed to the Railway Hospital. Although she received emergency treatment such as gastric lavage, the poisoning was too severe, and there was no hope of recovery. She died at 7:48.</p>
<p>Suicide Note… To a Colleague</p>
<p>It was later learned that Zhu's intention to commit suicide had been decided as early as two weeks prior. In her suicide note to her colleague Li Bingjie, she said, "I wanted to die a few weeks ago. Life is no longer worth living for me. I borrowed a handgun from a colleague two weeks ago" (note: undercover female police officers do not have guns). A photo was attached to the suicide note, and it also said, "You are my best friend. Since you got married, we have been distant. This is due to the environment. This is a photo for you to keep as a permanent memento." At the end, she wrote "Why am I" and "I am so miserable" three times. The full text of the suicide note was about two thousand words long. All her diary entries and correspondence had been burned before the suicide. She had also clearly marked in advance which of her belongings were to be given to her colleagues and which to her aunt.</p>
<p>Reason… Speculation</p>
<p>After the case occurred, the police department telegraphed Wuxi to summon Zhu's friend Li Bingjie to Shanghai for questioning. Li arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. According to Li, Zhu had a fiancé named Bai Shui, who is currently working in the 17th Traffic Police Detachment in the Northeast. He and Zhu were not on good terms. Recently, a friend of Bai, Zhang Yunkang, who is an air force pilot, came to Shanghai to visit Zhu and repeatedly invited her out, showing a strong intention to pursue her. However, Zhu had no affection for him. Zhang was resentful because he couldn't win her over, and he slandered her to Bai, sowing discord. This also gave Zhu a major shock. Zhu's family was also very complicated, and she was not tolerated by her father, so the reason for her suicide must not be simple.</p>
<h3>Mistress Resumes Prostitution, Paramour Wants to Die Together</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Pan Xiaomei, a prostitute in the Hong Ji brothel at No. 5 Yin Yu Lane, Liulin Road, lived with Zhu Yongci, a flour factory employee, two years ago. Later, Zhu lost his job, and they could not maintain their livelihood, so Pan resumed her old profession. On the 16th of this month, Zhu went to the brothel, hoping to see Pan, but she was not there. Zhu then committed suicide by taking poison, but fortunately, he was rushed to the hospital and saved. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Zhu took a bottle of disinfectant to the brothel and falsely told Pan that they were going to a lawyer's office on Taicang Road to discuss ending their cohabitation relationship. When they reached the west end of Xing'an Road and Huangpi South Road, Zhu pulled out the disinfectant and poured it on Pan's face, injuring her eyes. Zhu also swallowed disinfectant and committed suicide. The police arrived and sent both of them to the hospital.</p>

<h3>Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha Returns to Qinghai to Visit Relatives, Stops Over in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha, the elder brother of the Dalai Living Buddha of Tibet, arrived in Shanghai yesterday noon on a China National Aviation Corporation flight from Calcutta. Also coming were the Tibetan National Government official Dan Jigme Norbu Living Buddha. Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha is returning to Qinghai to visit relatives. Due to inconvenient transportation between Tibet and other regions, he took a detour through India, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. He will also go to Beijing to represent the Dalai Lama in paying respects to President Chiang.</p>
<p>Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha is very young, only twenty-seven years old this year. He became a monk at Tar Temple in Qinghai at the age of seven, and went to Zhaba Temple, one of the three famous monasteries in Tibet, at the age of twenty to study Buddhist scriptures. He has been away from his hometown in Qinghai for seven years. Yesterday, he stayed at the Dadong Hotel. He had a tall and thin figure and wore a golden-embroidered black and yellow dragon robe with a yellow silk belt around his waist, but he wore leather shoes on his feet. He had a fountain pen in his collar and a flat top haircut. He had a very handsome face, but otherwise, there was nothing special about him.</p>

<p>Tibetan Merchants… Found the Living Buddha</p>
<p>The current 14th Dalai Lama is his fourth younger brother. Their family is originally a Tibetan ethnic group from Yuhai, engaged in agriculture. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Tibetans searched everywhere for a replacement, but they had not found one after more than three years. In 1938, a group of Tibetan merchants came to their home and stayed overnight. In fact, this group of people were disguised to find the Living Buddha. The 14th Dalai Lama was only four years old at the time. After discovering him, they asked him, and his birthday perfectly matched. He also recognized the creations of the old Dalai Lama. Later, they escorted this young Dalai Lama to Lhasa to ascend the throne. He has been there for thirteen years now.</p>
<p>Second Younger Brother Studies… at the Central Military Academy</p>
<p>There are a total of five brothers in their family. The third and fifth younger brothers are still in Qinghai. The second younger brother is called Jia Rong. He is nineteen years old this year. Last year, he came to the East with the Tibetan National Assembly representative. Later, he entered the Central Military Academy to study. Now he speaks Mandarin very well. Yesterday, he came to Shanghai to welcome his brother. When reporters interviewed him, he translated. He wore an air force uniform and a leather jacket, looking completely like a modern urban youth, standing with his brother as if they were from two different eras.</p>
<p>Tubten Jigme Norbu Living Buddha has a very high position in Tibetan religion, but he has no contact with politics. According to him, the current situation in Tibet is still stable. The British run a hospital in Lhasa, which is very popular. The Dalai Lama has recently given two lectures, which is a major event in Tibet.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Tightens Staffing, Possibly Implemented Next Spring, Each Bureau and Department Cuts Staff by One-Tenth, Position of Deputy Bureau Chief Still Intended to Remain</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The issue of municipal government staffing cuts was seriously discussed at yesterday's municipal meeting. The municipal government's organizational regulations approved by the Executive Yuan allowed all existing institutions to be established, but in terms of staffing, the total number of people applied for by the municipal government was 3,576, and the Executive Yuan ordered a reduction of one-third. After receiving the instruction, the municipal government ordered the heads of each bureau and department to study in detail and provide opinions separately.

The deputy directors of each bureau are intended to remain in office because they are actually needed. As for other actual difficulties, such as the current four sections of the Public Works Bureau being cut to six sections in the new organizational regulations, and similar reductions in other bureaus, the municipal government believes that it is actually difficult to comply and has decided to maintain the status quo for the time being. The specific situation will be reported to the Executive Yuan. As for the staffing reduction standards that have already been decided, they will be based on their qualifications and usual work performance evaluation standards and may be implemented starting next spring.</p>

First, Li Fuxun, Shen Rixin, and Qi Zhi, the directors of the Three Industry Association, gave speeches, roughly saying that the purpose of financial control is to stabilize prices, which is necessary. However, the general public often blames financial practitioners for price fluctuations. In fact, today, each industry colleague has an average deposit of only a few hundred million yuan and has no ability to speculate. They deeply hope that the financial control authorities should analyze the current ailments and prescribe the right medicine, and not only implement negative controls, but also pay more attention to the development of the financial industry.</p>
<h3>Investing in Production: An Ideal Way Out</h3>
<p>Then Director Li gave a speech, roughly stating that all industries currently need stability, especially the financial industry. The control authorities will actively resolve the current difficulties and not only engage in negative controls.

The establishment of the Financial Administration of this city has three characteristics: 1. Simple organization. 2. Simple and practical management methods. 3. The government takes the lead and manages national banking institutions even more strictly than commercial banks. The management authorities have long had a deep understanding of everyone's insights.

<h3>"Social Butterfly" Leads to Embezzlement and Robbery, Boyfriend Conspires with Accomplices to Rob, Exposed and Arrested One After Another</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) "Social Butterfly" Wang Yuefen, whose original name is Zhou Fengzhen, lives at No. 21 Fuxi Lane, Xiangyang South Road, and frequents dance halls and theaters. She and her friend Shen Xingben have a deep affection. Shen often goes to her home and thus gets to know Wang's younger sister, Meili, and Di Yonggao. Over time, the younger siblings told him that Yuefen had $1,000 in US currency, and he had evil intentions. He then conspired with his friends Liang Zhenyue and Wang Yunian. He purchased a cotton rope and an empty coat box, agreeing that around 3:00 PM on the 27th, Shen would invite Wang to drink coffee at the Four Sisters Cafe. At that time, he would order Liang and Wang to enter the tea house under the pretext of giving a coat as a gift. Meili cordially welcomed them and went into the kitchen to make coffee. Seeing that the time was ripe, the two took out the cotton rope and first tied up her younger brother Yonggao on a chair and stuffed his mouth with cotton. Zhao Meili heard the noise in the outer room and saw Yonggao struggling through the crack in the door. Knowing that they were not good people, she secretly went out to report to the police. Liang had already fled, and only Wang Yunian was arrested and taken to the Changshu Police Sub-bureau. According to his confession, he lives at No. 9, Lane 89, Jinxian Road.

<h3>Pilgrimage to Qufu: A Trip to Southwestern Shandong</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Jinan Office, 23rd] Of the 107 counties in Shandong province, the Communist presence has been eradicated in two counties. One is Chang Le County, notoriously managed by Commissioner Zhang Tianzuo concurrently. The other is Qufu County, the "essence of sages and virtuous men."</p>
<p>Under the governance of County Magistrate Wang Zhenyu in Qufu for over a decade, even during the War of Resistance, he led the 230,000 people of the county in guerrilla warfare against the enemy. In late 1945, the Communist bandits amassed over 30,000 troops to attack. County Magistrate Wang led local forces in resistance. By New Year's Day 1946, they were ultimately defeated due to the disparity in numbers. County Magistrate Wang,</p>
<p>disguised in the darkness,</p>
<p>jumped from the city wall, managing to escape. On March 9, 1947, with the assistance of the National Army, after recovering the county seat, he earnestly organized the people, trained the people, guided the people, and controlled the people. He treated genuinely repentant and returning Communist members with leniency, implemented a policy of generosity, and strictly prohibited the people from taking revenge freely. On ordinary days, he spent almost two-thirds of his time traveling and inspecting the villages and townships, going deep among the people, and blending with them. He effectively eliminated corrupt officials and gentry, started anew with the people, shared their joys and sorrows. Thus, the Eighth Route Army could no longer find a foothold in the county, truly achieving "no thieves locally, so thieves do not come."</p>
<p>The old city of Qufu was originally located four or five li east of the city. It was moved to its current location during the Ming Dynasty, with a circumference of twelve li. The Confucius Temple occupies one-third of the area. Accompanied by County Magistrate Wang, I admired the Apricot Platform in the temple, the cypress planted by the Master, the Dacheng Hall, the Lu Wall, the Poetry and Ritual Hall, and other sacred sites. Then, I visited the Saintly Residence. Fortunately, Kong De-cheng, the Sacrificial Official of the Dacheng Zhi Sheng Xian Shi, was at home. During our conversation, I learned that he would</p>
<p>definitely go to America for inspection</p>
<p>before January 15th next year, for a period of eight months. All the procedures for going abroad have been completed. This return to his hometown is not for election campaigning but for a "family sacrifice." He has declined the government's nomination as a National Assembly representative candidate for Qufu County three times, but all requests were denied. Kong Decheng is a 77th-generation descendant of Confucius, currently about 30 years old, with a handsome appearance. He wore a fur robe and a fur hat. The Kong residence is a typical example of Chinese aristocratic architecture. Kong himself still retains a strong traditional aristocratic style. Inside the three-door main hall, the white-on-black wooden plaque of the "Chen Qi Chu" (Reception Office), responsible for communication, is still hung. Beyond the four-door entrance, there are wooden plaques for "Secretariat" and "General Affairs Office." Only the reception room opposite the Secretariat is a semi-Chinese, semi-Western building with white mud ceilings and floral ceramic tiles. Kong is a close friend of the veteran statesman Zhang Puquan, despite their age difference. When I told him that Elder Pu had passed away from angina pectoris on the 16th of this month, he expressed deep sorrow and regret and told me, "Elder Pu originally had heart disease. The</p>
<p>proximate cause of his sudden demise</p>
<p>may be related to the Shandong election issue. The reason is that when Mr. Ding Huaifen brought the list of Shandong National Assembly representative candidates to Beijing, several fellow villagers whose names were not on the list came to Beijing to lobby. Elder Pu, after discussing it with Mr. Ding, agreed to change a few names on the original list. This was heard by those who were removed from the list, who then went to Elder Pu to protest, saying: We in Shandong have elders of our own. You are an elder from Hebei Province. Please do not interfere in Shandong matters. Elder Pu then restored the preliminary list. Elder Pu's sudden death from angina pectoris may not be unrelated to this."</p>
<p>During their occupation of Qufu, the Eighth Route Army did not damage the Confucius Temple or the Confucius Forest outside the North Gate. They only plastered slogans on the red walls on both sides of the Confucius Forest. After the National Army recovered it, they washed and scraped off the slogans but did not repaint the walls. Therefore, at first glance, the walls appear very mottled, but this does not detract from the solemn grandeur of the Confucius Forest. Few outsiders know how much property the Confucius Temple actually has, but reliable sources say that there were originally over 6,000 hectares of land, extending east to the shores of the Yellow Sea, all being</p>
<p>Kong family temple property.</p>
<p>During the Eighth Route Army's occupation, some of it was struggled against by clansmen. It is now said to have been returned, but in counties outside the control of the National Army, rent has still not been collected. Kong Decheng was originally a posthumous child. After his father, Duke Yansheng Kong Lingyi, passed away, his uncle Kong Lingjun served as acting duke for eight years. However, clansmen, envious of this "vacant post," continuously accused and attacked Kong Lingjun for eight whole years. It was not until Kong Decheng officially took over that things calmed down. He now has one son and two daughters. The son is six and a half years old. This has always been a serious problem in old Chinese families, and hopefully, it will not be repeated in the Kong residence. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)</p>

It was later confirmed that this was a misreport. However, small groups of bandits entrenched in Taihu Lake were indeed former subordinates of Yang. The authorities then appointed Yang as a pacification commissioner to comfort the refugees. Amidst the suppression in Jiangnan, he temporarily became a news figure, and Yang's crimes as a traitor were spared prosecution. However, the Suzhou High Procuratorate recently received accusations that Yang arbitrarily killed people during his tenure in puppet positions. After investigation, the crimes were confirmed, and he was indicted today and transferred to the criminal court for trial according to law.</p>

<h3>Haining's Rising Sandbank Begins to Collapse</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Haining Office, 25th] The rising sandbank at the seawall outside the South Gate of this county has lasted for almost a year. At its largest, the sandbank reached fifteen li and could be walked on to the opposite bank of the Qiantang River, causing sea transport to be cut off. The transit business has moved to the two warehouses, and the commerce in the urban area has become doubly desolate. According to the person in charge of the Hangzhou-Haining section of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, the rising sandbank has recently begun to collapse. As of now, only about three li remain. If the tide is slightly stronger, it will all be submerged. The famous "Haining Tide" will return to its former glory. However, seawall projects have already been emphasized by all parties. The vicissitudes of life are unpredictable.</p>

<h3>Senator Ou Humiliates Councilor Ma Qu to be Transferred</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Haining Office, 25th] County Councilor and Director of the Press Association, Wu Jingya, had criticized the police station director's protection of gambling and neglect of public security at past council meetings. This incurred the hatred of Ma Qu, the director of the said police station, who on the 8th of this month, took advantage of Wu's presence at home, threatened him and humiliated him on the main street, causing public outrage. Representatives from Yanguan Town had petitioned the county government several times, almost leading to a town-wide strike. The county council and all its members also appealed to all sectors with justice. The County Press Association, the Press Friendship Association of the ten districts and the Press Associations of Jiaxing, Chongde and Pinghu counties sent telegrams of condolence and support for freedom of speech and personal freedom, vowing to provide support. County Councilor Wu Jingya also filed a lawsuit with the district court. The court opened a trial on the 13th of this month, but Ma Qu failed to appear in court. The County Council specially convened a temporary county administration review meeting on the 20th and resolved to request the county government to promptly dismiss Ma Qu and punish him severely.</p>
<p>After the incident, parties and government officials mediated. According to the county government's announcement today, three agreements have been reached: Ma Qu will be transferred and the position of director will be taken over by Zhu Bodi. Ma Qu will publish in the newspaper: "It is difficult to shirk responsibility, so I hereby publish an apology and respectfully apologize to the County Council." Also apologize in person. Councilor Wu withdraws his lawsuit from the District Court. However, it is heard that the press will file a complaint against Ma Qu again.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Emphasizes Normal School Education: Orders Promulgation of Improvement Measures for Elementary Normal Schools: Provinces Must Not Reduce Existing Schools Under Any Pretext</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, 26th] The Ministry of Education emphasizes normal school education and has recently issued improvement measures for elementary normal schools, with six key points, ordering their implementation: 1. Regarding the age of admission to elementary normal schools, a previous order had been issued to all provinces and cities to raise it to 15 years of age. Since some provinces and cities are still unclear, it is proposed to reiterate the previous order. 2. The original temporary duration of study at the school was four years. However, since the provinces needed teachers urgently, the number of schools offering a three-year system has increased. Now, provinces can still offer a four year program if teacher quantities are still insufficient. 3. Regarding the reduction in the number of schools due to the abandonment of rural towns, it is proposed to order all provinces to earnestly follow the provisions of the Second Five-Year Plan for National Education, and should expand the number of classes year by year, and shall not reduce the original schools under any pretext. 4. Provinces should give priority to employing elementary normal school graduates and teachers who have been trained and certified as qualified to serve as primary school teachers, and implement an internship system, training unqualified teachers in phases. 5. It is ordered to all provinces to earnestly improve the treatment of primary school teachers so that outstanding young people will enter normal schools and make excellent teachers feel at ease in their work, thereby promoting the early popularization of national education. 6. Provinces where elementary normal school graduates are sufficient for allocation may consider converting them into normal schools.</p>

<h3>American Educational Institutions Discriminate Against Minority Students</h3>
<p>[Reuter's News Agency, Washington, 25th] Legislation prohibiting secondary schools and universities from discriminating against minority students is expected to face strong opposition in Congress. This law was drafted by the President's Higher Education Committee, but its fate in Congress is expected to be the same as the ban on employment discrimination, which has been discussed for more than a decade without a resolution. It is universally acknowledged here that a system of discrimination against minority students still exists in American educational institutions, but those who oppose correcting the racial discrimination system believe that correcting this traditional system will inevitably cause resentment among people in the southern states. Even a small number of members of the President's Higher Education Advisory Committee also advocate "only setting up schools exclusively for blacks, rather than allowing blacks and whites to study in the same place." For example, in Washington, only Howard University simultaneously accommodates black students. The Advisory Committee's report also recommends suspending government funding for schools with racial discrimination systems. Although this legislation will be submitted to Congress, southern state lawmakers will definitely find ways to obstruct it.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Xu Peikun, president of the National Beiping Railway Management College, has recently traveled to Beijing to consult with the heads of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Transportation regarding the expansion of funding and the issue of property rights.

<h3>President Cheng of Jiaotong University Has Returned to School from Beijing: Discusses Financial Strain at Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Cheng Xiaogang, president of National Jiaotong University, returned to school the other day after traveling to Beijing last week to request the Ministry of Education to increase the university's operating expenses. According to him, the university's current operating expenses and equipment funds are extremely strained. The Ministry of Education only approved an increase based on the university's pre-war expenses. However, pre-war expenses were based on the number of students. The number of faculty and students has increased dramatically since the war, and the increase in expenses has not been proportional. This is a common feeling among all national universities today. The significant inadequacy of operating expenses is obvious.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] As for the engineering machinery and instruments allocated to various schools from the Japanese war reparations materials, Jiaotong University has been allocated ten machines, which will be used for student practice.</p>

<h3>City Government Orders Closure of 204 Silver Shops and Money Exchanges</h3>
<p>Money Exchange Trade Association to Also Cancel Registration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Financial Administration has determined that the money exchange industry in this city has mostly engaged in foreign currency exchange business. Since the government explicitly banned gold sales and foreign currency circulation, the money exchange industry has long lost its business objectives and is no longer viable. However, it has been found that the industry mostly uses the names of "silver shops" and "money exchanges," which is confusing with the names of "silver and money houses" approved by the Ministry of Finance. In order to prevent confusion and prevent the circulation of illegal currency, the bureau has decided to rectify the situation. It has announced to all money exchange shops that, from this date, in addition to ceasing money exchange operations, all original names of "silver shops" and "money exchanges" and their signs must be removed. The industry's trade association must also cancel its registration to reflect the actual situation and prevent abuse. Those who fail to comply or secretly violate the order will be sent to the court for strict legal action upon discovery. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance for record, the bureau has specifically requested the City Government to investigate and execute the order. The City Government issued an order to the police department on the 26th to cooperate with the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus to enforce the order. A total of 204 money exchange shops are to be closed, and their names are as follows:</p>

<p>Small Stocks Generally Plummet; Hua Shares' Situation Uncertain</p>
<p>Hua shares experienced a general trend of "selling small and buying big" activities yesterday. Small stocks are gradually facing a "sunset is infinitely good" situation. Yongsha is still stable, but the process also appears uncertain. Short sellers are instead buying goods off-market, suggesting a potentially major change in the future.</p>
<p>Opening prices were high, especially for small stocks. Qinxing opened high at 57 yuan, and Xinhua even reached the涨停(price limit). However, the situation changed after the opening. Small stocks rose too sharply and quickly fell. Yongsha advanced to 551 yuan and 560 yuan, then retreated to 544 yuan and 553 yuan. Feng'an挂涨停(price limit up), and Yongsha returned to the 550 yuan and 560 yuan range. Off-market interest rates opened lower at two jiao four and two jiao eight and a half fen. Yongsha soon weakened again, falling to 543 yuan and 549 yuan, before once rising to a high of 560 yuan and 569 yuan, only to fall again to 547 yuan and 553 yuan. Yongye 挂涨停板(price limit up). Yongsha's noon closing price was 554 yuan and 561 yuan. All small stocks, except those whose managers abandoned maintaining them, experienced a very general trend of "selling small and buying big" activities, resulting in second-tier and miscellaneous brands closing at lower prices. Xinhuo, however, closed at a high price. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, the immediate delivery shares Jingguang and Jingfu fell by half a percent, Jinglun and Zhabei fell slightly, Xinhuo and Huochai Zhongxing rose by half a percent, Xinhua, Feng'an, Yonggong, and Huafeng rose by one percent, Yongye 涨停(price limit up), Zhongfang, Tongyi, Datong, Meiya, and Shangwu were flat, and the rest rose slightly. Among the deferred delivery shares, Huafeng and Xinhuo rose by half a percent, Jingfu fell by half a percent, and Xinguang and Qinxing fell slightly. The rest rose slightly.</p>
<p>Some rumors in the after-market fueled selling pressure, and state-owned banks intervened significantly. Yongsha fell sharply, especially Qinxing, which fell to a low of 41 yuan, the most severe. However, with the support of the managers, small stocks were rescued. Yongsha's immediate delivery closing price was 548 yuan, while the deferred delivery price was instead 546 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, the immediate delivery shares Tongyi, Datong, Shangwu, Huafeng, Jinglun, Chen'an, Jingfu, Xinhua, and Huaxin were all down by half a percent, Qinxing was down by one percent, Huochai was flat, and the rest were down slightly. Among the deferred delivery shares, Xinhuo, Huafeng, Qinxing, and Xinguang were all down by about half a percent, and the rest were down slightly. Off-market, old shares continued to see gains, especially Dasheng No. 1 Factory, which rose by 20 percent. The largest gains were by No. 3 Factory, Nanyang, Xinhua, Shang, and Shijie, which each rose by 10 percent.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise Again; Oil Market Rises Straight Up</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 17,800 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. Inland prices rose again, and as a result, both japonica and indica rice rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan. The price of white rice remained firm, secretly increasing to kill the trend. The supply of flour was insufficient to meet demand, and prices rose straight up after the opening, increasing by more than 10,000 yuan. The price limit was consistently above 40,000 yuan for all flours. Bran also rose sharply by 10,000 yuan, and there was still a shortage of supply.</p>
<p>Although soybean cake trading was slow, all commodities rose, making sellers even more firm and following the rise by 10,000 yuan. Guest help for yellow soybeans remained stagnant, and the local market was normal. High-quality goods were average, and Duhuang was also lackluster. However, oil factories increased their intake of medium and low-quality guest soybeans, raising prices by more than 10,000 yuan. Broad beans were sluggish and uncompetitive. The situation was flat and weak. The supply and demand of mung beans were both scarce, and there were no temporary fluctuations. Red beans were also traded lightly, with no price changes. The arrival and storage of wheat were both scarce, and prices continued to rise by 20,000-30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum spirits were actively traded, rising by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Northern corn was actively digested, rising by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to be digested, and high-quality goods rose again by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Few transactions of medium-quality goods occurred in the local market, and the situation was temporarily flat. Tianjin sesame seeds were actively traded, with aggressive purchases. Guangdong merchants also participated, and the market was chaotic. At the closing, prices jumped wildly and unevenly, soaring by more than 100,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market was soaring. Ningbo merchants purchased, and southern China inquired. Prices soared by more than 100,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, and the situation was chaotic, with no formal market conditions.</p>
<p>Yarn Control Committee Convenes Cotton Textile Industry Leaders to Discuss and Hope for Sincere Cooperation from Private Factories</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yuan Chen, Chairman of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, convened the heads of the six district cotton textile associations, including Wang Qiyu, Tang Xinghai, Liu Jingji, and Rong Erren, at 4:00 PM yesterday. Yuan expressed that after the passage of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations, he deeply hoped that all yarn factories would cooperate sincerely and provide detailed reports on their cotton inventory, cotton demand, and cotton yarn production. If the management regulations can be effectively implemented for three months to half a year, it will be clear that the regulations are not intended to exploit the textile industry, but rather to help the development of the textile industry's future. Representatives from private factories immediately expressed several opinions: (1) The management regulations did not mention increased production. For example, there are currently 4.5 million spindles nationwide, but only 3.6 million are operating. The reasons for the 900,000 spindles that are not operating should be investigated and quickly put into operation to increase cotton yarn production by 20% to adjust supply and demand. (2) The management regulations still require permits for the transportation and sale of cotton yarn to various locations. This creates great doubts for the operations of each factory. In the current period of material shortage, regulations restricting the transportation and sale of cotton yarn should be reduced. (3) The spinning and weaving sectors have had close relationships in the past. This should be taken into account under the unified purchase and sale system. This will avoid the separation of high-quality raw material supply in the cotton yarn and cloth sectors, which could damage the reputation of each factory's original product trademarks. (4) If the rigid regulations on cotton-for-yarn exchanges encounter fluctuations in the cost of living or commodity prices while cotton prices remain the same, a flexible solution should be sought. Yuan stated that as long as all factories can cooperate sincerely, he is willing to consider any difficulties that may be encountered after implementation.</p>
<h3>Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Raised to 29.52 Million Yuan for 20-Count Yarn</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The negotiated price of cotton yarn by the Spinning and Textile Adjustment Committee has been adjusted yesterday. The price of 20-count yarn has been raised to 29.52 million yuan. The prices of other counts of yarn have been determined separately in proportion and with reference to market conditions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the committee and the Spinning and Construction Company sold yarn separately, resulting in a total sale of 1,626.5 pieces, equivalent to 2,304.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were a total of 364 applications. The selling price of yarn by the Spinning and Adjustment Committee for 20-count yarn varied from 30 million yuan for Ruyi to 32 million yuan for Hongkui Xing. 39.5 million yuan for 32-count Yenfeng, 43 million yuan for 40-count Riguang, and 49.5 million yuan for 42-count double-strand Lanfeng.</p>
<p>Firm Yarn Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was firm due to the increased negotiated prices for yarn sold by the Spinning and Construction Company. Furthermore, with looser credit among industry players and a healthier appetite, and with the arrival of guest traders to inquire, the market situation was generally optimistic due to the forced shutdown of the Qingdao Yarn Factory. Until 11:30, the Spinning and Construction Company suddenly suspended the price and accepted bids from industry players, leading to a weakening trend. However, by closing time, continuous purchases from all parties caused prices to recover. As a result, the immediate price of 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn reached 50 million yuan, and the forward price was 50.05 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, prices for 40-count and 32-count yarns rose by 100,000-200,000 yuan to 700,000-800,000 yuan. Prices for 20-count yarn fluctuated. Prices for 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns, etc., varied from 150,000 yuan to 500,000-600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Slightly Softer Cloth Market</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened yesterday with the Spinning and Construction Company's unified allocation of cloth, with more gabardine being sold, increasing the amount of chips on the market. Many floats sold off heavily. It was also heard that the Shanxi gang's large orders of gabardine notices had been sold off in small amounts, causing prices to fall once. However, after 10:30, a Hankou gang suddenly came to absorb many gabardine warehouse receipts, and Guangdong gangs also increased their intake, strengthening the market. Manufacturers, however, were tied up with employee year-end bonuses, weakening their willingness to increase their intake. Local buyers were also scarce. As a result, the limited price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth remained unchanged at 1.372 million yuan, but off-market bids rose to 1.386-1.387 million yuan with transactions. Prices for other grades of fine cloth fell slightly by 4,000-8,000 to 12,000 yuan. In addition, except for Zhigong and blue cloth, which were firm, most other cloths showed a flat or soft trend.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Export Committee reported that since the 24th of last month, the committee has processed a total of 123,741 pieces of cotton cloth for export in exchange for Indian cotton.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Hold General Meeting Yesterday to Fight for Future Status</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Merchants Association of this city held a temporary members' meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM yesterday. The presidium consisted of Liu Pingxun, Zheng Zhezheng, and Chen Qingzheng. Liu and Chen first delivered speeches, stating that cotton merchants have no status in the passed management regulations for cotton yarn and cloth. Cotton merchants have a history of over 8,000 years, and they made great contributions to the purchase of cotton during the Anti-Japanese War. Cotton prices have depreciated since the announcement of the unified purchase policy, and cotton merchants have suffered significant losses. The management regulations give status to yarn and cloth merchants, but cotton merchants are excluded. A discussion was then held, and it was finally decided to appoint 17 people, including Liu Pingxun, to convene a small group meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon to study detailed measures, and then visit Chairman Yuan of the Adjustment Committee next Monday to petition.</p>
<h3>Responsible Person from Fuel Management Discusses Coal Supply Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to the responsible person of the Fuel Management Committee, due to the recent difficulties in transportation on the Beining Railway, in order to increase reserves, efforts will be made in the future to source coal from Taiwan and the Jinpu Railway to ensure smooth supply and make up for shortages. Taiwan regularly exports coal, totaling 40,000 tons per month, of which 20,000 tons are shipped to Guangdong and Fujian, 5,000 tons to Qingdao, and the rest to Shanghai. This month, a total of 1,740 tons have been shipped, and the Tainan ship loaded with over 7,000 tons on the 23rd of this month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of the month. The output of the Huainan, East China, and Zhongxing mines along the Jinpu Railway totals 200,000 tons per month, of which 40,000 tons have been shipped to Pukou. Transportation has been coordinated with the Railway Bureau and will soon be shipped south in a steady stream. It was also learned that the Beining Railway was severely damaged by bandits on the 9th of this month, resulting in only 50,000 tons of coal being shipped to Qinhuangdao in the first ten days of this month. After emergency repairs, transportation was restored on the 24th, and a small amount of coal was shipped from the production area. In view of the fact that coal reserves in Qingdao are not as abundant as in Shanghai, in order to supply in advance, 7,600 tons have recently been shipped from Qinhuangdao to Qingdao, of which 2,000 tons have been allocated to the China Textile Construction Company, and the rest to the local power plant.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Exchanging Three-Year Allied Bonds Completed</h3>
<p>Those Who Exceed the Deadline Will Be Considered Donations</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has stated that the affairs of the 33rd year Allied Bonds have been concluded for a long time, but some areas still have not completed the exchange of the bonds. The ministry has now issued a general order to the finance departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to complete the exchange before the end of March of the 37th year. Those who exceed the deadline will be considered to have donated to the country and will be transferred to the national treasury.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds and Foreign Shares Mediocre</h3>
<p>Public bonds were quite mediocre yesterday. Unified C opened at 30,000 yuan, with a low price of 29,300 yuan and a high price of 31,000 yuan, before closing at a price of 0.05 yuan. Compared to the previous closing price, A and B were flat, C rose by 200 yuan, D rose by 400 yuan, and E fell by 200 yuan. 3 million yuan was traded.</p>
<p>Foreign shares rose and fell unevenly yesterday, but were generally mediocre with little change. Yisha opened at 428,000, gradually falling from 430,000 to 415,000 before stabilizing slightly. However, there was still little improvement in the after-market. The Guangdong gang sold, while securities companies and foreign companies bought. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, British Union, Tram, Agriculture, and Guangdong Commerce were flat, Tram fell by half a percent, and the gains and losses of other shares were minimal.</p>
<h3>US Wartime Bonds to Fall in Price from the 24th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to relevant sources, the Federal Reserve Bank has stated that the price of the 2.5% bonds of September 1967-72 will fall from 7037-32 yuan to 7038-32, the price of the 2.5% bonds of December 1967-72 will fall from 7077-32 yuan to 7038-32 yuan, and the price of the 2.5% bonds of 1959-62 will fall from 70073-32 yuan to 100 yuan. The Federal Reserve also convened brokers dealing in these bonds on the evening of the 23rd, publicly stating that it would fully maintain the new prices of the bonds after the price drop. This news is relevant to the future of the US dollar exchange rate in our country. Another authoritative figure in the financial sector in this city stated that this news confirms that the US currency is also continuing to depreciate. The Federal Reserve's move is due to the fear that banks and brokers dealing in these bonds will sell the bonds they hold due to the depreciation of the currency, which would be detrimental to the operation of the financial market. Therefore, it has stated that it will clearly maintain the quasi-price of the bonds after the price drop. Therefore, we can predict that the exchange rate of our country's US dollar will not be further lengthened in the short term.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Banking Association</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Banking Association of this city convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at around 5:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Chairman Li Fusun. Important discussion proposals included: The Ministry of Finance previously borrowed from various banks, mostly using public bonds issued before the war, which will be repaid at a rate of one to one, resulting in too much loss for the banking industry. In addition, pre-war deposits in the banking industry have also been repaid after being increased by 1,700 times. Therefore, it was generally agreed to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to negotiate a proper solution. Important decisions were also made regarding the payment of special business tax: (2) The tax rate remains unchanged at 4%. (3) Each head office will collect and pay the taxes to ensure accuracy and convenience. (4) After the year-end final settlement, all members of the association will be notified to handle the matter together.</p>
<h3>Business Briefs</h3>
<p>Yao Chongyong, Director of the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee, has been concurrently appointed Director of the Hankou Financial Administration Bureau. During Mr. Lin's absence from Shanghai, all secretarial duties of the Committee will be temporarily handled by Mr. Chen Shuceng, an advisor of the bank, as assigned by President Zhang.</p>
<p>The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee will hold its first temporary committee meeting this afternoon. Chairman Yuan will provide instructions on the development of committee affairs. The committee will also convene a meeting within the year to discuss the conclusion of its business.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Company is scheduled to hold a board meeting this morning. Chairman Chen Qitian will personally preside. It is reported that how the company's business should develop after the management of cotton yarn and cloth, and how to handle the business entrusted to the company by the Yarn Management Committee will be discussed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Cotton Production Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is also scheduled to hold a routine meeting this afternoon at 4:00 PM at the company.</p>
<p>Huainan Mining Railway and Datong Coal Mine Companies held a joint extraordinary shareholders meeting at the Bank of China on the fourth floor yesterday afternoon. Chairman Zhu Yong reported on the merger of the two companies and approved the capital adjustment plan for revaluing the fixed assets of the two companies. The total adjusted capital is 18 billion yuan, divided into 180 million shares, each share worth 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the money market was slightly tight, with the unofficial interest rate at 0.24. The four banks and two bureaus had a net inflow of 11.01 billion, with the Central Bank receiving 7.44 billion, large exchange at 8.34 billion, foreign banks receiving 1.56 billion, small exchange at a net outflow of 12.91 billion, China Bank with an outflow of 1.48 billion, Bank of Communications with an inflow of 2.23 billion, China Trust Bureau with an inflow of 3.07 billion, and other banks and bureaus with no major inflows or outflows.</p>

<h3>Livingstone's Views—On the Functions of History and Literature in Education</h3>
<p>— Mao Zishui</p>
<p>Sir Richard Livingstone, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, wrote a small book in 1943 entitled "Education for a World Adrift". Like Livingstone's other books discussing education, this book is well worth reading carefully by those who care about modern problems and educators. One chapter in the book examines history and literature from an educational perspective, and the arguments are very balanced and insightful. I will now summarize the main points of this chapter as an introduction.</p>
<p>Livingstone believes that the primary task of education is to cultivate moral character, and the cultivation of moral character lies in enabling students to see the greatness in life and to recognize the highest qualities in life. The great scenes in life are taught to us by the two subjects of literature and history in every school.</p>
<p>However, if we want to see the highest qualities in life clearly, we must read literature and history with a special eye. There is more than one way to read a book. Let's talk about history first. We can see it as a record of the rise and fall of dynasties; but soon after closing the book, we forget those events. Of course, we can pay attention to specific things, such as the growth of civilization, the development of political thought, and so on. These are all necessary and essential knowledge. But this is not the main purpose of history in education. If we want to obtain spiritual value and "good" examples from history and literature, we must search carefully. In recent decades, there have been three changes in the fashion of history teaching. At first, the emphasis was on emperors and generals, diplomacy and war; later, attention was paid to social conditions and the lives of ordinary people; finally, history became the story of human beings evolving from animals to savages, and from savages to civilization. There are many reasons for human progress. Physiology, climate, and economics are all factors; great figures are also a factor. The rise and fall of nations, the ebb and flow of civilizations, can indeed give us a "great" picture, but in the words and deeds of great figures, we can see clearly human courage and perseverance, human desire for wisdom, and human sincerity and reverence for "good"—these are the pure forces that drive humanity from darkness to light, from savagery to civilization.</p>
<p>We can divide the people who created civilization into three categories. One is the people of action, one is the people of thought, and one is the people of revelation. These three types of people are the three strands of the great rope of civilization. If we cannot recognize one strand clearly, we will not know the structure of the whole rope. The influence of people like Faraday, Darwin, Pasteur, and Adam Smith is naturally great; but their influence is different from that of Socrates, Plato, the Stoics, Jesus, and Augustine, and even more different from that of Alexander, Augustus, Cromwell, and Napoleon. If we read history as a record of human evolution, we must see clearly all three strands of this great rope of civilization—the spiritual, the intellectual, and the political. In fifth-century BC Athens, we must remember Socrates and Democritus (the expounder of ancient Greek atomism), as well as Pericles (the Athenian statesman); in the twelfth century, we must remember St. Bernard as well as Henry I; in the sixteenth century, we must remember Thomas More, Copernicus, as well as Henry VIII and Martin Luther; in the nineteenth century, we must remember Darwin and Shaftesbury, as well as Bismarck and Cavour. Historians often suffer from prejudice. Early priests could not see the strand of thought and knowledge; modern Wells, in addition to science, also neglected other strands.</p>
<p>In the slow, roundabout, and discontinuous progress of mankind, Socrates seems more important than Pericles, St. Bernard more important than Frederick, Thomas More more important than Henry VIII, and Pasteur and Darwin more important than Bismarck. However, with this view, we inevitably risk looking down on entrepreneurs. In reality, a politician with both greatness and goodness may contribute less to civilization, but is as worthy of respect as religious figures, reformers, and scientists; because his work may be even more difficult than theirs.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, we can also divide it into several levels. Some people are pioneers of new ideas. Hosea said, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." Jesus said, "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven." These kinds of words and views can change the world; they are revelations of higher standards of living; they are pregnant with new life.</p>
<p>The second is those who cultivate themselves and act with integrity. Socrates was such a person; St. Bernard was also such a person. In times of difficulty and hardship, few people are more worthy of emulation than St. Bernard. In his time, bandits roamed and religion was corrupt. He could have drifted along with the tide to preserve his life in troubled times, or he could have fallen into pessimism and given up on himself. But he did not. He used his perseverance and determination to engage in a hopeless war in the hope of changing the world and improving it. If there were not a few such people in the world, humanity might not have made much progress.</p>
<p>Let's turn to literature. Like history, literature is a treasure trove of the first-class achievements in life. Reading literature is like reading history, it depends on what path we take. Usually when we read an essay or a poem, we can pay attention to the time of writing, the origin of the article, the author's resume, and the appreciation of his work by his contemporaries; we can also pay attention to technical aspects, such as words, tones, and structure; we can also read it with a mood of passing the years; we can also read it with the purpose of obtaining the life and world views of the wise men of the past. The function of literature in education lies in this last point of view.</p>
<p>Some literature is a direct revelation of the highest qualities of human life and nature, such as Arnold's "Morality," Wordsworth's "Ode to Duty," or his "Character of the Happy Warrior." These poems read almost like the chapters of Plato, Spinoza, or Kant. In these words, we feel that poetry is a criticism of life, it is unsystematic moral philosophy. Such poems, like philosophy, are easier for people over twenty to understand and appreciate than for people under twenty.</p>
<p>In some poems, the ideas of life are not simply stated, but are attached to things. Wordsworth's "Leech Gatherer" is an example. The subtitle of this poem, "Resolution and Independence," shows the poet's intentions at the time.</p>
<p>There is also a class of poems, such as Spenser's "The Faerie Queen," Milton's "Paradise Lost," Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound," and Tennyson's "Idylls of the King," that contain a view of life, but it is not very obvious.</p>
<p>These poets all want to express their moral concepts didactically. But moralists are not necessarily the best moral teachers. Fortunately, Britain has produced the world's greatest poet, and this poet's concepts of good and evil are very clear. All kinds of human character and interest, except for religion and science, can be found in Shakespeare's works. The characters he describes are good, bad, great, and small; but who is good and who is evil is very clear.</p>
<p>The highest qualities in life and human nature are scattered in many places in history and literature, as long as people know how to find them. But here, a problem arises again. Good and bad, wheat and chaff, grow mixed together in these fields. Attila, Borgia, and Frederick the Great, in one sense, are great men. Villon and Boccaccio can also be said to be first-class writers. But this kind of superiority is not what we are looking for. In literature and history, just like in life, there is both good and evil, and they are mixed together. It is very dangerous to ignore good and bad and not to choose carefully. The worst thing is to be infected with those abnormal opinions and poisoned by "teaching obscenity and theft"; the best thing is to become a person "without a sense of right and wrong." We certainly do not want to subject our pure-hearted youth to the harm of such works. This is a major problem in education.</p>
<p>Do we want to implement the method of withdrawal or deletion? This is almost impossible. Can we withdraw history? Can we erase the records of great traitors and villains? Not to mention anything else, the Christian Bible also has good and bad in it. Who can have the opportunity to revise it? But even though we cannot withdraw or delete, we must always have a distinction between good and evil.</p>
<p>Some great figures in history are like stars, always shining brightly; some are like meteors, looking brighter than stars, but only flashing for a short time. We must not confuse greatness and goodness. Between 1770 and 1870, there were three people who changed the situation in Europe: Frederick the Great, Napoleon, and Bismarck. Many history readers are blinded by their brilliance. In reality, their greatness cannot cover up their sins. The world would be better off without them. I say this not out of disgust for politics. Political power and justice are not mutually exclusive. Abraham Lincoln of the United States also lived in this period; but he combined greatness and goodness in one person, he was a model politician, he was someone we should all emulate.</p>

<h3>"Archaeology in Gansu"</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Dr. Pei Wenzhong, recorded by the Peking University History Society</p>
<p>The Xiahe River Basin During the height of the Yangshao culture, this culture also spread to this area. However, there is another culture in this area, which is the "Qijia period" used by Mr. Andersson, which I changed to "Qijia culture". Mr. Andersson believed that the Qijia period was one of the earliest periods of painted pottery culture, but according to the results of our observation this time, I believe that Qijia is another system of culture, developed in the Xiahe River Basin, and reached the Taohe River Basin at its peak. The Qijia culture occupied a long period of time, earlier than or appearing at the same time as the painted pottery culture. The Qijia culture seems to have been influenced by the Microlithic culture. The existence of small stone tools and Comb ceramics is proof of the influence of the microlithic culture.</p>
<p>3. Questions brought back</p>
<p>This time in Gansu, after five months of fieldwork, we only brought back many questions. We cannot talk about any discoveries. We hope to continue working in the future to solve these many questions. I will now just mention a few big questions and talk to you about them.</p>
<p>(1) The Origin of Painted Pottery Culture</p>
<p>Painted pottery culture has been found in Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, and this time we saw the heyday of painted pottery culture in Gansu. Where did the painted pottery culture originate, in Henan? Or did it originate in Gansu? This is a question that our predecessors debated but failed to solve. This time we went to Gansu, but we still brought this question back and still haven't solved it. As for the relationship between foreign painted pottery cultures, such as those in Central Asia and Europe, it is naturally even more impossible to talk about.</p>
<p>(2) The Origin of Chinese Culture</p>
<p>How did Chinese culture come about? We still don't know. We only know that there was an Yin culture (that is, Xiaotun culture). The Zhou dynasty destroyed the Shang, and then passed it on to the Han dynasty. The characteristics of Chinese culture were complete and the development was at its peak. In the four regions I passed through this time, we can see that Han culture replaced any earlier culture. Whether Yin culture is Chinese culture is a question. What was Chinese culture like before the Yin dynasty? It is even more impossible to talk about. I once said that the reason why painted pottery culture declined in the upper reaches of the Wei River was due to the influence of "primitive Chinese culture", that is, primitive Chinese culture rose in the upper reaches of the Wei River, replacing painted pottery culture. The so-called "primitive Chinese culture" is a hypothetical term. Whether the culture that rose to replace painted pottery culture can be considered Chinese culture is really still full of questions. If we can solve this question, we will be one step closer to solving the question of the origin of Chinese culture. To solve these many related questions, we still need our future efforts.</p>
<p>(3) The Question of the Zhou Ethnic Culture</p>
<p>According to ancient records, the Zhou ethnic group came from the west, developed in the lower reaches of the Wei River, and then moved east to destroy the Shang dynasty. However, what we know today about the culture of the early Zhou dynasty is almost entirely inherited from the Yin culture. The Zhou was an ethnic group. Before destroying the Shang, they secretly had their own culture. If the Zhou ethnic group did come from the west, then they must have come from the upper reaches of the Wei River. What we obtained from our investigation in the upper reaches of the Wei River this time was that the decline period of the painted pottery culture, in terms of the era, was approximately equivalent to the era when the Zhou ethnic group lived there. Is the painted pottery culture after the decline the Zhou ethnic group's own inherent culture? This is a question worthy of study, but unfortunately our work this year did not solve this question. We brought it back and asked everyone to solve it.</p>
<p>(4) The Question of Limestone Dwellings</p>
<p>During this trip to Gansu, we initially saw thin layers of limestone, and later we tried excavating several places. In one place in the Taohe River basin, excavation revealed that this limestone layer was square, with a round pit in the middle, which seemed to be a place for burning fire. In a limestone layer, four coarse rope-patterned pottery and a tripod ding were unearthed. The remains of a woman and two young children were also discovered. Observed from various aspects, this limestone layer was the floor paved in the ancient people's dwellings, and its age was approximately equivalent to the period of the decline of the painted pottery culture, and at the latest before the Han dynasty. What is the relationship between these dwellings and those in the lower reaches of the Wei River and Henan? What is the exact age of this dwelling? What about the upper part of this dwelling and its doors? All these need to be solved in the future.</p>
<p>(5) The Question of Mr. Andersson's Various Stages</p>
<p>Based on the results of our observation in Gansu this time, we feel that there are also considerable problems with Mr. Andersson's staging. The first is Mr. Andersson's "Qijia period". Because there is very little painted pottery in this period, Mr. Andersson believes that this is the earliest period of painted pottery culture. According to what we have found this time, the so-called Qijia period sites are widely distributed in the Xiahe River Basin and are very developed. I personally believe that the Qijia period represents another type of culture, which is temporarily called "Qijia culture". This culture is a complex Amphora-style large-eared pottery pot, and at the same time has struck stone tools and microliths. I speculate that the Qijia culture is another system of culture. I don’t know whether this culture and the painted pottery culture came before or after. It's very strange. Mr. Andersson's "Xindian period" does not exist in the upper reaches of the Wei River.</p>
<p>As for Andersson's "Siba period", what we encountered this time were only tombs, and no dwellings were found. Does this period belong to the painted pottery culture system or the Qijia culture system? Is there any relationship with limestone dwellings? At present, it is impossible to determine.</p>
<p>In summary, our archaeological work in Gansu this time did not solve the problems, but brought back many questions, asking everyone to solve them with us. If we cannot solve them now, we should continue to work hard to find a solution in the future. We are engaged in academic work, and we cannot hope for quick results. For example, we spent several months this time and walked a very limited distance, and there will be no results. However, we can bring back many questions and talk to everyone about them. In terms of academic research, it can be said that this trip was not in vain. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>On the Translation of Buddhist Scriptures as Literature (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yiliang</p>
<p>My second point is to regard the translation of Buddhist scriptures as fables, stories, and popular literature of this kind. We know that India is the origin of many fables and fairy tales in the world. Buddhist scriptures absorbed many of these stories and were translated and transmitted to China. Many Chinese stories and myths were influenced by the translation of Buddhist scriptures. The most popular example is the three disciples of Xuanzang in *Journey to the West*—Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Heshang—all have Indian prototypes, as Mr. Chen Yinke has already pointed out. (See "The Evolution of the Story of Xuanzang's Disciples in *Journey to the West*," published in the Bulletin of the Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica, Volume 2, Part 2.) Earlier, many popular literary works unearthed in Dunhuang, such as *bianwen* (transformation texts), were also based on Buddhist scripture themes. Going back even further, most of the *zhiguai* (records of anomalies) novels of the Six Dynasties were more or less products influenced by Buddhist scriptures. Therefore, when discussing literature, Buddhist scriptures are undoubtedly a treasure trove. To study the origin and evolution of Chinese popular literature, Buddhist scriptures are also an indispensable key.</p>
<p>Pali Buddhist scriptures contain the most fables in the Jataka tales. In the Chinese translations of Buddhist scriptures, the collections in the *Sheng Jing* (Scripture of Births) and *Liudu Ji Jing* (Collection of Six Perfections Sutras), etc., are the most comprehensive. Let me give an example. This fable's Sanskrit text can be found in the *Panchatantra* (Five Chapters). In the Chinese translations of Buddhist scriptures, the *Liudu Ji Jing* translated by Kang Senghui of the Wu dynasty, the *Sheng Jing* translated by Zhu Fahu of the Western Jin dynasty, and the *Fo Benxing Ji Jing* translated by Baoyun and Nanjotara all contain the same account. I will use the version in the *Sheng Jing* here as a representative because it is the best written of the three. It is not only instructive but also full of wit, humor, and humanity. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"In the countless eons of the past, there was a monkey king. He lived in the forest, eating fruits and drinking water. He thought that all beings, moving and breathing, should be liberated and reach Nirvana. At that time, he befriended a turtle. They respected each other and never quarreled. The turtle often visited the monkey, eating and drinking, and discussing the righteous principles. His wife saw him often going out and not staying at home, and suspected him of being promiscuous outside. She asked her husband, 'Why do you go out so often? Are you being unrestrained and immoral outside?' Her husband replied, 'I have become friends with a monkey. He is intelligent and wise and understands the principles of righteousness. I often visit him to discuss the scriptures and laws. We only talk about pleasant things and there is no licentiousness.' His wife did not believe him and thought otherwise. She was also angry at the monkey for enticing her husband to go out so often and always plotted to kill him so her husband would stop. She then pretended to be sick and lay weakly in bed. Her husband took care of her, providing medicine and treatment, but she still did not recover. She said to her husband, 'Why bother with medicine? My illness is very serious. Only by obtaining the liver of your close friend, the monkey, can I live.' Her husband replied, 'He is my close friend. I entrust my life to him and have no doubts about him. How can I plot against him and use him to save you?' His wife replied, 'We are husband and wife, one body. If you don't think of helping me but instead protect the monkey, that is not reasonable.' Her husband, pressured by his wife and respecting her, went to ask the monkey, 'I have often visited you. I hope you will not refuse to visit my humble home for a small meal.' The monkey replied, 'I live on land, and you live in the water. How can I follow you?' The turtle replied, 'I will carry you on my back. It will be alright!' The monkey then agreed. The turtle carried him to the middle of the river and said to the monkey, 'Do you want to know the truth? The reason I invited you is that my wife is sick and needs your liver to cure her illness.' The monkey replied, 'Why didn't you tell me earlier? I hung my liver on the tree and didn't bring it with me. Let's go back and get the liver, and then I will go with you.' He then returned to the tree, jumping and rejoicing. The turtle asked, 'You said you would bring your liver to my house. Why did you go back to the tree, jumping and leaping? What is the reason?' The monkey replied, 'There is no one more foolish than you in the world! How can anyone have a liver and hang it on a tree? We are friends, entrusting our lives to each other, and yet you plotted against me, wanting to endanger my life? From now on, let us go our separate ways!'"</p>
<p>In this passage, "Ren" (仁) is a respectful term for the second person, an abbreviation of "Ren zhe" (仁者, benevolent one). "Zhi cou" (至凑) and "Qin qin" (亲亲) are also common terms in early translations of Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>In addition to fables, there are many good stories in Buddhist scriptures. The main collections include the *Zhi Qian Yi Zhuan Ji Bai Xiang Jing* (Collected Parables of Zhi Qian), the *Xian Yu Jing* (Sutra of the Wise and Foolish) translated by Huijue and others of the Northern Wei dynasty, and the *Za Bi Zang Jing* (Miscellaneous Collection of the Vinaya) translated by Jijiaye and Tan Yao of the Northern Wei dynasty. The *Mulasarvastivada Vinaya* translated by Yijing contains many long and complex stories. Only a few collections of *avadana* exist in the original Sanskrit versions of these stories. I recently heard that the Sanskrit text of the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya has been discovered in Kashmir. When it is printed in the future, it will undoubtedly add valuable materials for studying these stories. Unfortunately, the stories are too long to quote. I will only give a brief example. This story also appears in the *Sheng Jing*, but the wording and structure in the *Mulasarvastivada Vinaya*, *Po Seng Shi*, Volume 12, are better, so I will use Yijing's translation. It tells the story of a weaver's uncle and nephew who committed theft together:</p>
<p>"The weaver obtained what he wanted with plenty to spare. The nephew asked the uncle, 'I am working in the same trade as you, why is your house always full and prosperous, while my home is always in need?' The uncle told the nephew, 'I do two trades, and you only do one.' The nephew asked the uncle, 'What is the second trade?' He replied, 'I steal at night.' The nephew said, 'I will also steal with you.' The uncle replied, 'You cannot steal.' The nephew answered, 'I am very capable!' He thought, 'I will try first.' After thinking this, they went to the market together. The uncle bought a rabbit and asked the nephew to prepare it: 'I will take a bath and come back to eat.' After he prepared it, before the uncle arrived, he ate one leg. When the uncle returned from his bath, he asked his nephew, 'Is it ready?' The nephew replied, 'It is ready.' The uncle said, 'Since it is ready, bring it here for me to see!' The nephew brought the rabbit to his uncle. The uncle saw that the rabbit was missing a leg. He asked the nephew, 'Where is the fourth leg of the rabbit?' The nephew replied, 'The rabbit originally had only three legs. Why are you asking me for the fourth leg?' The uncle thought, 'I am already a thief, but this nephew is a greater thief than I am.' ... That night, he and his nephew dug a hole in someone else's wall, intending to steal valuables. After digging the hole, the uncle first put his head into the hole. The nephew said, 'Uncle, you don't know the art of stealing! How can you put your head into the hole first? This is not good. You should put your feet in first. If you put your head in first, they will cut off your head, and everyone will recognize it, bringing disaster to the whole family. You should put your feet in first.' Hearing this, the uncle put his feet in. The owner of the house woke up and shouted 'Thief!' The people heard the noise and grabbed the thief's feet inside the hole. At that time, the nephew pulled his uncle out from outside the hole. He was not strong enough and feared that disaster would befall him, so he cut off his uncle's head and ran away. He reported the matter to the king and his ministers. The king told his ministers, 'The one who cut off the head is the biggest thief! You should place the thief's body in the middle of the four streets and secretly watch. If anyone mourns and takes the body away, that is the thief, and you can arrest him.' The ministers obeyed the order and placed the body as the king instructed. The thief-nephew thought, 'I should not directly carry my uncle's body, lest people recognize me! I should pretend to be crazy in the four streets, hugging men and women, trees and stones, cows and horses, and pigs and dogs.' After thinking this, he acted accordingly. When the people of the world saw him hugging everything everywhere, they all knew he was crazy. Then the thief-nephew hugged his uncle, weeping bitterly, and left. The ministers reported to the king, saying, 'Those guarding the body saw only a crazy man hugging the body and weeping, and no one else.' The king said, 'He is the dog thief, why didn't you catch him?' ... At that time, the thief again thought, 'How can I not bury my uncle? I must bury him!' He pretended to be a cart driver, loaded with firewood, and drove to the body. He quickly untied the ox and set fire to the cart. Then he ran away. At that time, the fire from the cart burned the body to ashes. ... At that time, the thief again thought, 'I must set up sacrifices at the place where I buried my uncle's body.' After thinking this, he pretended to be a pure Brahmin and went around the city begging for food. He then placed the food in five places at the cremation site to secretly sacrifice to his uncle, and then left. ... At that time, the thief again thought, 'I must throw my uncle's bones into the Miqia River.' After thinking this, he pretended to be a skull heretic, took the remaining ashes from the bones, and smeared them on his body. He collected the burned bones and placed them in a skull bowl. He threw them into the Miqia River and left."</p>

<h3>Remembering the Humiliating National Policy of the Japanese - Low Eaves, Part Two</h3>
<p>The breaking point of the "July 7th" Incident was the small town by the Lugou Bridge in Pingxi (formerly the seat of the Xilu Subprefecture, now Wanping County). The Japanese army was conducting exercises nearby, claiming that during the roll call, "one person was lost." They insisted on entering the city to prove "themselves," which was not allowed. The defending army, responsible for its territory, believed that foreign soldiers searching the city at will was a great disgrace and decided to resist. Both sides opened fire, triggering a full-scale war that poisoned Chinese territory, plundered and harmed the Chinese people, and launched the Pacific War. Ultimately, they suffered a crushing defeat and, in August 1945, accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered completely. From high-spirited arrogance to bowing their heads in submission, they truly "lost face."</p>
<p>The Japanese used the excuse of "losing someone" to search for the missing soldier more than once (in Beijing dialect, it's called "zhao cha'er," in Shanghai dialect, it's called "ban cha tou," meaning deliberately making trouble). For example, the "September 18th" Incident also used the wording "Nakamura's disappearance" to justify shelling the Beida Camp. In Shanghai, from the "January 28th" to the "August 13th" incidents, almost every incident used "losing someone" as a pretext.</p>
<p>In June of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the Japanese Vice-Consul in Nanjing, Kuramoto, suddenly disappeared. The Japanese ambassador and the Japanese government again used this as an excuse to make a fuss, making threatening and intimidating statements. Wang Jingwei, who was then the President of the Executive Yuan, panicked and ordered a large reward and searches everywhere. As a result, Kuramoto was found in a secluded mountain cave in the suburbs. The reason was that he was pessimistic and world-weary but was playing a joke on his country's "losing face" policy. Wang quickly sent someone to escort him to the Japanese embassy. The embassy was very embarrassed and sent him back to Japan on charges of "humiliating the country." In fact, Kuramoto's case was a minor matter and did not constitute "humiliating the country." However, the Japanese side's intimidation and demonstrations resulted in an anticlimactic situation and international ridicule, which was indeed a bit "humiliating"!</p>
<h3>Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>The judiciary emphasizes evidence. Solid evidence makes people confess their crimes without resentment. Otherwise, even if the criminal confesses, those watching will still not understand the reason, making it difficult to establish credibility. However, the search for evidence is truly not easy. Wang Dongxu's *Liunan Suibi* records: "Shi Min, courtesy name Ziqiu, was a native of Changshu. He once served as the magistrate of Gushi County. Two villagers entered the city and moored their boats in the same place. One was a rice seller, and the other was a rapeseed seller. They argued over a bamboo basket and started wrestling. The basket originally belonged to the rapeseed seller, so they sued in court. Ziqiu declared to the crowd, 'This matter does not need to be judged by people, judging the basket is enough.' He then ordered a constable to take the basket and beat it with a stick. The onlookers were puzzled. When the stick struck the basket and broke it, rapeseed rolled out from the seams. The rice seller kowtowed and confessed his crime. Everyone praised him as a divine magistrate." Also, "Sheng Yuzan of Wuxian County once served as the magistrate of Lanxi County. Two families argued over a calf and filed a lawsuit. Sheng then had two mother cows brought to the side and ordered someone to stroke the calf. One mother cow made a mournful sound, and he was able to find the owner and return the calf." His discernment was similar to Shi Min's, both due to precise understanding. Also, Lu Yitian's *Lenglu Zashi* quotes Luo Siju of Fuyang's anecdotal stories as a regional commander: "The commander once led troops into the South Mountain to search for remaining bandits. The villagers complained that monkeys stole crops from the fields. Every morning, they fired firearms to scare them away. The commander asked the reason and ordered a monkey to be captured. He ordered someone to shave its hair, paint its face with colors, creating large eyes and ugly features. The next morning, when the monkeys came, he released the monkey. The monkeys saw it and were all startled. The monkey belonged to their group, but they did not understand why they were startled and thought they had abandoned it, fearing they would be captured again. They chased after it relentlessly, crossing dozens of mountains. After that, they never came again. Everyone admired his intelligence." Although this matter is different from the previous two, they all relied on superior understanding. Therefore, I have recorded them together.</p>
<h3>News from the Porcelain Department</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jingxiang</p>
<p>Lord Ling Xiaohan'ge discussed the "porcelain" of Jingdezhen in this publication, expressing relief that it was not completely destroyed. The author has lived in Jiangxi Province for several months. Although I am completely ignorant of "porcelain," I have a high interest in appreciating it. When I have nothing to do, I always carefully observe the porcelain shops and chat with people in the industry. I will briefly describe some of my observations, which I believe will be of interest to those who care.</p>
<p>Although the Victory Kiln was added to Jingdezhen after the victory, the output of the Victory Kiln is not much. Among them, the innovative Victory Teapot can be considered a novel and popular product. On both sides of the lower end of the teapot spout, there are embossed circular Victory characters. This can be regarded as a representative work of the Victory Kiln and also a product of the "Porcelain Capital" commemorating the victory.</p>
<p>Although Jingdezhen has the title of "Porcelain Capital," it is actually a poor handicraft industry area. The locals call themselves "grass shoe heads" because seven or eight out of ten people wear grass shoes. As the name suggests, one should know the degree of poverty. The number of industrial workers is only one-third of what it was before the war. The capital of most factory owners is insufficient, so production is decreasing daily.</p>
<p>Exquisite fine porcelain is now rarely produced, and antique imitations are also becoming scarce. Usually, a plain body with fine painting is considered a high-quality product. There are also few successors to the talent of porcelain painting. Currently, Zhang Zhitang's horse paintings and Liu Yucen's bamboo paintings are considered famous porcelain painters. In addition, Zou Houwen's landscapes and Xiong Mengwei's flowers are also well-known old masters.</p>
<p>A teapot with a famous painting costs more than 100,000 in the market, and a small set of five stationery items requires 200,000. In the past two months, prices have increased by more than two times. A table of fine porcelain tableware costs more than 10 million, and ordinary tableware costs 5-6 million. People in the porcelain industry believe that porcelain prices are still cheap. They say: If you compare it with the price of colored pigments, the price increase of porcelain is far behind! This is also a fact.</p>
<p>Jiujiang is now a distribution center for porcelain. Porcelain shops are lined up like scales, with a shop every three steps and a store every five steps. They all display new and different patterns to attract passersby, which is a bit dazzling. Every time a ship docks in Jiujiang, it carries some porcelain out. However, the porcelain carried away is all of medium and lower quality. Fine porcelain sells more slowly.</p>
<p>Genuine old porcelain is very rare. Only Huachang Porcelain Shop still has some on display. Porcelain figurines, such as the Three Stars of Fortune, Longevity, and Prosperity, Guan Gong, Ji Dian, and Guanyin statues, are most exquisitely produced by Guanghua. Small pieces of painted porcelain are most numerous and exquisite at Lisheng Porcelain Shop. Because there are many porcelain shops, business is also dispersed, which still seems to be sluggish. Currently, the waterway is shallow, and the transportation of goods from Jingdezhen is greatly hindered. Transporting by manpower on land costs 500,000 per load, so the cost is getting more and more expensive.</p>
<p>Jiangxi's porcelain industry is still in a dim process. It urgently needs blood transfusions and heart strengthening to prosper. At the same time, quality improvement and retraining of technicians are also urgently needed. Because the craftsmen have a deep conservatism and lack new scientific technology, many people think of our porcelain expert, Mr. Du Chongyuan. He had the determination to reform the "Porcelain Capital," but he broke the entire renovation plan for the sake of the war and sacrificed his life in the remote Magicians' Hall. Not only did the country lose a specialized talent, but it was also a great loss to Jiangxi's porcelain industry! (Sent from Jiujiang)</p>
<h3>On Reducing the Burden on Students</h3>
<p>— Tizhai</p>
<p>The other day, all the newspapers published the news that the Ministry of Education had decided to revise the secondary school curriculum standards to reduce the burden on students. It is said that the main subjects such as Chinese, mathematics, and English will be reduced appropriately. English will be no more than three or four hours per week, and mathematics will also be less than five hours, etc. This is naturally a matter worthy of discussion in the education community, although I have not seen any opinions on it to this day.</p>
<p>The call to reduce the burden on students existed before the war. The first person to propose it was Ms. Chen Hengzhe, who elaborated on her theory of the excessive burden on students in a Sunday essay in the *Ta Kung Pao*, citing her own children as examples. During the War of Resistance, the curriculum standards (based on the 25th year of the Republic, 1936) were revised. The main trend was to increase war-related technical courses such as military training and nursing, and the number of class hours for academic subjects was reduced, which can be said to be the implementation of Ms. Chen's proposal.</p>
<p>For the sake of the physical health of the second generation of youth, we absolutely do not oppose reducing their mental burden. However, we feel that there are many problems here that must be solved in conjunction; otherwise, although the burden is reduced, the benefits may not be there.</p>
<p>According to the intentions of the Ministry of Education, although regular classes will be reduced, more time for self-study will be added outside of class, which is the so-called self-study guidance. The term self-study guidance has been popular in the Chinese education community for many years, but how many can truly provide self-study and guidance? Only God knows. The prerequisites for self-study guidance are equipment and talent. Taking the hundreds of public and private middle schools in Shanghai as an example, how many have complete and well-equipped libraries and laboratories? How many teachers are truly able to fulfill their guiding responsibilities and have the ability to guide? I feel that there are many doubts.</p>
<p>Lin Yutang once wrote an article about self-study. He argued that universities do not need to spend so much money hiring lecturers and professors but should use the funds to expand libraries. A university student should have the ability to use books to increase their knowledge independently. Incompetent professors sitting idly in their positions are not as good as students reading a few more books. This is indeed true, and I think that in the process of education, there may be such a day, such as today's correspondence schools, etc., which are not this idea? However, at present, the most difficult thing is how to have such a sum of money to buy so many books. The funding for public schools is limited, and private schools don't even need to be mentioned. Even if they have money, they won't do it. Students' heads are almost empty except for Chinese textbooks, English textbooks, and trigonometry and geometry. They can't wait for the bell to ring and flock to the cinemas (movies are also education, but it's hard to say in Shanghai). Lower down, dance halls and Yue opera theaters are also the only places for them to pass the time. The teachers lecture until their throats are dry, but they are still confused. If they simply don't lecture, what will be the result? I probably don't need to say it again. Every year, when universities enroll students, people lament the low level of students. Is it that the students themselves want to be at a low level? Is it because there is too much homework and the burden is heavy that they are at a low level? I don't think we should put the blame all on the students. If I were to go to this kind of empty "school" at this time, there would probably be no other way to go than to be at a low level.</p>
<p>University professors go to be officials, and middle school teachers are promoted similarly. Today's middle school teachers also have some problems. But can we blame them? The salary is low, and they cannot make a living. Not to mention that the basic level and qualifications are not enough, even if they are, who has the mind to teach well? Who can have the leisure to improve themselves? With teachers like this and equipment like this, will simply reducing the burden on students have an effect?</p>
<p>However, in the current environment, what qualifications do we have to demand more equipment and improve the quality of teachers?</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Unexpected Calamity (26)</p>
<p>Qihuan was deeply moved by what Zhu Qi said. She felt that others could not forgive her, but he could. He could completely express the unspeakable pain in her heart, truly her first soulmate in life! At this moment, she was extremely moved, hugged Zhu Qi's arm with both hands, buried her face on the back of his hand, and cried! Zhu Qi also felt sad and comforted her, "Don't cry, your health is important!" The more Qihuan thought about it, the more heartbroken she became. She couldn't hold back her tears and cried for a while, venting all the stimuli she had received, the accumulated depression, and the grievances she had suffered. Only after this great cry did she feel a slight relief. She wiped her tears and said, "Only you can understand my pain. Not even my father, my mother, or my brother know. Not to mention others. If they knew I suffered this loss, I'm afraid they would laugh at me. I really have no face to go back." Zhu Qi said, "This is already in the past. Don't mention it again. Get well and go back. Who will know! Even if they know, they will only think you were injured in a car accident. Please rest assured. A person gains more experience and increases their knowledge. The hearts of people in society today are so sinister, especially you young ladies, so innocent and romantic. You don't know that people's hearts are so bad? You are lucky to be unlucky today!" Qihuan saw that Zhu Qi's words were considerate and called her "Miss," which showed how much he respected her in his heart and that he did not look down on her in the slightest. When she first met him, she only thought he was a handsome man. After talking to him, she only knew that he was honest and not a frivolous young man. Now, she saw that he was a sincere, enthusiastic, righteous, and empathetic man who deeply understood women's psychology. Such people are rarely seen. It's just a pity that he already has a wife! Gratitude and admiration intertwined, and although Qihuan didn't say a word of thanks, her eyes were full of affection, and her feelings of gratitude and admiration were revealed beyond words. The two chatted for a while, and Zhu Qi looked at his watch, which pointed to twelve o'clock. It was getting late, so he advised Qihuan to rest early and took his leave. From then on, whenever Zhu Qi had time, he would take the time to visit the hospital. For several days in a row, Qihuan's family and outside relatives and friends knew that Qihuan was injured in a car accident and was recovering in the hospital, but they knew nothing else. In the hospital, Qihuan only hoped that Zhu Qi would come early to talk, feeling that talking to Zhu Qi was more enjoyable than anything else. After a week, the wounds on Qihuan's face and arms had gradually healed. Zhu Qi received a mission from the head office to investigate the business of the Tianjin branch and came to say goodbye. When Qihuan heard that Zhu Qi was going away, even though it was for a very short time, she felt sad in her heart. After Zhu Qi went to Tianjin, every two or three days, she received a letter from Qihuan, reporting that his scars had healed, reporting that he had left the hospital and returned home, and hoping that he could return to Peiping as soon as possible to see her again. If he was late, she could not wait. It turned out that she was also leaving Peiping. (End of this chapter)</p>
<h3>In Memory of Comrade Zhang Puquan of the National History Museum</h3>
<p>— Jin Gong</p>
<p>First Poem</p>
<p>Joining the Tongmenghui, at the age of twenty-four (in the thirty-first year of Guangxu, he and I joined the association in Tokyo), I was just a youth, running around like a shadow, advocating righteousness together, having faced danger several times, clearly a secret society (formed the Mingmingshe in Hongo District, Tokyo, secretly discussing revolutionary plans), relying on the eastern neighbor for protection.</p>
<p>Second Poem</p>
<p>Uniquely having extraordinary aspirations, sharing difficult and bitter years, a word related to revolutionary affairs, astonishing the four seats, driving out the Qing court, the Yuan government was new, the cattle and horses of Longmen, lamenting this cold year.</p>
<h3>On American Magazines</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>Since the victory, Shanghai has discovered many "American accessories," one of which is the American magazine stands near the popular street cinemas. They are filled with a colorful array, with several types such as Reader's Digest, Crown Magazine, and Life Magazine piled high, indicating good sales. I don't know how many copies of each fashionable American magazine can be sold in Shanghai, but the enthusiasm and abundance of stock probably compare favorably with ordinary Chinese magazines.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon worth pondering. Shanghai is said to be an international city, but now it is a "city of American accessories." As far as magazines are concerned, although British magazines are written in a language similar to that of American magazines, they are nowhere to be found on the stands, let alone Russian or French magazines. Even if today's America is superior to Britain in terms of army, navy, air force, or other technical sciences, Britain is not necessarily inferior to America in education and arts. Since Chinese people can read English anyway, why do they flock to American English magazines and look down on British ones?</p>
<p>The scarcity of Russian and French magazines is, of course, due to the rarity of Chinese people who understand Russian and French. Why is it rare? This is certainly the result of Chinese primary and secondary schools only having English classes and no Russian or French classes. Chinese education authorities and the education sector advocate English education; public central primary schools have English classes in the fourth grade, and private primary schools with some church school characteristics teach ABCD in the second grade. An English expert once said to me: I believe learning English should start no later than eight years old. When asked why, he said, “My children all started learning English at school before they were eight years old. Whether their phonetic foundation was properly prepared, I don't know because I was already forty-eight years old when I learned English. But in any case, my children's Mandarin pronunciation is inaccurate, and they have lost much of their native accent. Is this a gain in English at the expense of Chinese, or is it like a hunchback somersaulting, failing on both ends? I don't know."</p>
<p>But the effect of Anglicized education has finally emerged, which is the increasing sales of American magazines. Reader's Digest is said to have foreign language editions, such as French, Spanish, and Japanese editions. I once wondered why there was no Chinese edition, but now I understand that since the Chinese intellectual class has become an English-speaking class, there is naturally no need to waste manpower and money translating it into Chinese!</p>
<p>However, there are good reasons for Chinese people to love reading American magazines. The content of general American magazines is different from that of Chinese magazines. In short, the former emphasizes life, while the latter emphasizes the world and the nation. It is not easy to determine who is right and who is wrong, but if someone prefers to read works that are closely related to life and does not welcome speeches about governing the country and bringing peace to the world, then it is natural for them to like reading American magazines that talk about life, and they should not be equated with those who believe that even the moon is better in America.</p>
<h3>Ode to Light</h3>
<p>— Bai Wuwen, Painting by Long Sheng</p>
<p>It's actually childish and laughable to say that I lived in Chongqing for nearly three thousand dark nights, and spent this sixth of my life under the flickering light of vegetable oil and tung oil.</p>
<p>Like a firecracker exploding in the sky and earth, the sound of victory lightly touched my heart and it burst open. Like a child, I smelled the air, and upon entering the city, I smashed the "bright oil lamps," vegetable oil lamps, carbide lamps, and Mobil lamps to smithereens; celebrating the light, venting anger at the darkness: Ah! No longer writing and chanting poetry under this pitiful flame! Ah! No longer being a ghost composing poems in a autumn grave!</p>
<p>I wasn’t naive enough to dream that the moment victory arrived, the Chongqing power plant's new machinery would immediately fly in from overseas, generating 100,000 kilowatts of electricity to compensate me for the eight years of failing eyesight. Impossible! But I did have this expectation: after several organizations, a certain population, and several wartime factories returned east, how much electricity would be saved? The consumption of a place serving as the capital would shift to the light of an ordinary city, and there would be no more "power outages" no matter what.</p>
<p>For two years, my wife complained more than a dozen times, not because I broke the oil lamps, but because I shouldn't have exchanged two boxes of "fish candles" (Note: This is a Chongqing term, derived from whale oil) for cigarettes and turned them into wisps of smoke.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, the force of aiming practice was limited to burning an incense stick in the dark, placing it a certain distance away, gradually moving it further away, aiming and hitting the flame on the incense stick. In days without power outages, a 100-candlepower electric light had the same eye-training effect. Light lies in the ambiguity of existence. If you want to visualize it, it's best to use an idiom for criticizing Song Dynasty lyrics: "The idea arrives, but the brush doesn't." To put it more simply, it's like an old woman who can't sleep on a winter night in Jiangnan, sitting up and idly stirring the embers in her hand warmer. You should be able to appreciate this "artistic conception," right?</p>
<p>In addition to the fixed area power outages twice a week, sometimes the lights suddenly went out, which was called a temporary power outage. The people in the city were like ants spat on by a naughty child, immediately scrambling and bustling about, rushing to the small shops to buy candles and oil. It's not an exaggeration to say they were like ants. Often in dark alleys, "two ants" would touch each other, and without a sound, they seemed to understand each other and went their separate ways, never arguing.</p>
<p>Last night, I was teaching a night class at a journalism school when the lights suddenly went out. I stood on the high platform and watched the students and workers busily lighting a row of white candles on the table. I felt a bit self-satisfied, like Ah Q, as if I had ascended to the altar—becoming an angel, especially after the lights came back on and a halo (!) faintly appeared above my head.</p>
