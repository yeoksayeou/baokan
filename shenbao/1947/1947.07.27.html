<h3>美對華政策協會發表　致魏特使公開函　促美尊重諾言予我經濟軍需援助　蘇應償還中國東北損失</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿六日電〕美對華政策協會（已故密勒士評論報發行人鮑威爾曾爲該協會會長），頃發表致總總統特別代表魏德邁將軍之公開函件，促請尊重「僅予中國國民政府以經濟援助及軍需供應」之諾言，該函日期爲七月十七日，係經由南京美大使館轉交魏氏者，茲節要錄後　故羅斯福總統批准國務卿赫爾於一九四一年十一日廿六日致日本駐美大使野村吉三郎之照會時，渠終於採取元全實現前國務卿海約翰於一八九九年宣布並由前國務卿休士列入一九二二年九國公約中之門戶開放政策之堅定立塲，赫爾國務卿於其致野村之照會中，堅持美日兩國應同意僅與中國國民政府在「政治經濟及軍事方面」之合作，但在雅爾達密約中，羅斯福總統却又將中國東北之若干特權權予蘇聯，從而同意破壞門門開放政策，雙方並以明白表示之諒解，約定蘇聯僅承認中國國民政府。翌年八月，上述諒解即正式載文於中蘇條約中，蘇聯則同意僅予中國國民政一付以經濟援助及軍需供應，自彼時起，蘇聯即蓄意違反該條約之幾乎每一點竟然僅予中國共共產黨以援助及軍需供應，吾人則亦已違反雅爾達協定。蓋吾人竟同樣予中國共產然及國民政府以援助也。吾人認爲：目下吾人應尊重重一九二二年之門戶開放政策及對中國之獨立與領土完整之謠言，因此，吾人必須仍以吾人最充分之支持給予中國國民政府，一如吾人在危機時「由於此一危機始產生珍珠港事件」所為者然。吾人亦應尊重羅斯福總統在開羅會議中所作神聖之諾言，「　將東北歸還中華民國」，如今已屆蘇聨遵守其神聖協定及　選中國國民政府認識各項原則及義務，而在太平洋方面作戰一點爲葛礎，自對日勝利日以來，吾國政府即拒絕中國國民政府在天購買軍火或彈藥，並請英國亦取同樣態度，但今日已屈給予中國以援助，使其擊敗蘇聨所授意蘇指示及蘇武裝之共產黨叛亂之時機矣。中國國民政府　今日正為吾人而戰，一若英國在一九四零年至一九四一年所為者然，吾人應樹定一項政策，使之尊重吾人之一切語言及國際協定，使之恢復吾人在亞洲十億人民心目中之信譽及使之進免必將更為恐怖之第。次珍珠港事件。</p>

<h3>對日和約有關國運前途　政府應早宣示立場　監委士等提五緬建議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十六日電〕美邀　東委會十一會員國興行對日和約初步會識　，監院　委劉士篤，楊宗培，蔡自聲，王冠吾，劉延濤等五人，特提出五項建義，主張政府就對白和約問題，作鮮明之表示。該建議經于右任核准，已　向行政院提出。劉等於提出建議前，首說明：「我國對日抗戰，血戰八年勝利雖已獲致，和約迄未訂立，近聞關國邀請盧東委會各會員國於八月十九日初步商計對日和約問題。查對日和約，不但為清算抗戰血債之總結，亦爲開啟未來國運之前奏，我政府對此重大問題，早應宣示明確之立塲與態度，俾與會諸國得以明瞭，並　重我抗日領導國家之意見。乃迄至今日，政府對此並無　毫表示，對於佔領日本亦從未發表何種見解，在遠東委會中，亦未提過何種文件，外國與論，頗以爲異，時至今日。勢不能由事含　」</p>
<p>劉等之五項建議爲：（一）我國對於日本雖一以寬火爲懷，不念議悲，在和約中應由各方面嚴密規定，以保證無再被侵略之危險，如永遠不許成立軍隊，　毁軍需工業，及再敎育日本人民等。（二）麥帥主張日本保留一九三領至一九三四年永準以上之工業標準，我國應表示反對，蓋根據開羅宜害，日本應退爲農業國，我國必須堅持我國決不能讓日本工業超過中國工業水準，以致再度發生經濟侵略，且日本工業趕過現時中國工業水準之一切設備，應全部拆遷，作爲　償抗戰期間一切公私損失之用，我國應得之賠償物資，並應索償足够搬運之船隻，以供運輸。（三）日本及其傀儡政府，在中國發行僞幣所吸去之物資之價値，應由日本全部賠償。聞現在日本銀行之黃金珍寶，約値二億美元，又日本政府通司藏　價値七百五十億元之鑽石黃金，及布疋等物，在應充作賠償之用，我國至少應要求半數，以爲整理我國幣制之用。（四）我國與日本，必須要在相等的工業水準之上，始能開放對日貿易，否則我國工業必將遭受壓迫。（五）利約簽訂後，我國應繼續參加相當時期的軍事佔領，政治監督，以使日本澈底民主化，不致再有獨佔資本的財閥，軍國主義的軍閥出現，再度發生侵略的危險。其結論稱；以上數點，均爲開啓我國未來國運，滿足安全要求之最低條件，自應本戰勝國家之立塲，作鮮明表示。</p>
<h3>暫緩開放對日貿易案　參會駐委會通過　決定辦法送衣政府辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕暫緩開放對日貿易問題，廿六日晨參政會駐委會舉行全體審查會討論，並請外交·經濟·財政三部派代表出席報吿。會議由草德惠主席，報吿後主席以廿五日在駐委會討論未竣之對日貿易兩案提出討論，一爲鄭揆一等提「請政附在未簽訂對日和約前暫　開放對日貿易案」，一爲薛明劍提「擬請政府暫緩開放對日貿易案」。經各參政員熱烈爭辯，至十二時始獲　論如次：「兩案合併討論，辦法兩點：（一）請政府在和約未簽訂前，暫緩開放對日私人貿易；（二）謀與日本臨時互通有無起見，可將過去已與日本進行之物物交換辦法，予以改善或擴充。送請政府辦理。」廿六日會議爲全體審查會，惟經州廿五日駐委會全體會時決定，全體審查曾所作結論，即駐委會之結論，故即照審查會之決定送請政府辦理。</p>
<p>三部代表報告</p>
<p>今日開會時，外部代表黃正報報吿稱：外部自獲悉麥帥總部已決定開放日本對外貿易之消息，及我駐日代表團報吿各國均將派遺赴日商務考察團後，即邀集有關機關研討辦法，旋經決定　赴日商務考察團，俾對日工商各業實况予以研討，同時向我駐美大使顧維鈞電詢三事：（一）對日貿易是否需要管制日本機構之決定，是否需在遠東委塵會通過？（二）已否在遠東會通過？（三）我代表有無一表示？經顧大使答覆，遠東委會對此間題正討論小。因此，我方所老慮者爲，如我反對，是否可阻止其開放？如我取反對態度，不予開放，而其他各國仍可與之通商貿易，在外交上亦爲我方之損失。財部代表朱　報吿稱，開放對日貿易問題，與財部有關者爲兩點：（一）對日貿易須付美金，而我美金存底太少，有人認爲我可以糖鹽換取美金，不致有困難，唯根據調查，我國過去和日本貿易，均係入超甚大，故此點値得注意。（二）盟總規定貨價，係依照世界市塲價格，以支持日本出口商，將來對我商業係于大打擊。經濟部代表楊樹人亦續就接獲外部通知以後及赴日商務老察團之籌組作簡略報吿。參政員薛明劍，武肇煦，廿家　鄭揆一等於各部報吿後紛紛提出詢問，各代表即席作答，然後退忠</p>
<p>各參政員意見</p>
<p>旋各參政員再度提出對「暫綏開放」之意見，提案人及發言者，幾悉反對開放，惟因須顧及國際外交，容有考慮之處，故發言者中並無正面維設開放一說者。武肇煦稱；本人認爲開放對日貿易問題，並非政策上之決定，而係技術上之商討，吾人以原料運出，以消耗品入口，且我旣派商務老察團赴日，自然不能阻止日商業團體至我國境。循此，日人可至我東北，可至我台灣，今後問題紛爭，將不斷發生，而萬寶山事件亦可重演，吾人能不引爲警惕？甘家馨認爲開放對日貿易後，在政治上，對中日關係是否有所影響，可予老慮慮。同時吾人可着重以下數點予以討論：（一）請政府通知盟總對日貿易應採嚴格管制政策不能對日帝國主義殘餘予以扶植（二）開放日本對外貿易政策中之不合理辦法，明州總應予改正。如我前頒佈進出口補貼辦法後，美即宣佈對策，以抵銷我國之鼓勵出口辦法，類此事件，是否亦在對日貿易時出現？應注意及之。（三）對日貿易之開放，政府應就當前財　　濟國際貿　　盤計劃。（四）在　項準備未完成前，暫　開放對費貿易。其後尙有若干參政員提出意見，認爲如將來日貨充斥市上，市塲各物競相傾銷，我國工商業經濟勢將遭受嚴　打擊，　未來再有戰事發生，則將本能　今日視之。</p>
<p>決定兩案合併</p>
<p>又財部代表會聲明在對日和約未訂前，可以不受會際貿易會議之限制，關稅可自由決定，提高或改變之，故我國對日稅則可能元一特別稅則，即（一）與我工業生產有幫助者不必提高，如漂白粉，硫磺等化學原料等；（二）奢侈品及與我有競爭性者，均可提高。然薛明劍復提出日本發表計劃在本年度內對我國貿易，擬出超五十萬美金，緒續其經濟侵略，此點一業已足使我人警惕，而如我人復有走私等情發生，則我開人起可能達一千萬美金，贊不堪設想。靈論甚久，最後決定以兩案合併。原有第一案中第二項辦法，召集人民社團代表並羅政工商專家，制定貿易方案，以爭取對日貿易主動地位一點，認爲施行不易，劉予保留。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約廿六日電〕新聞週刋最近一期載稱：美國政府將不顧蘇聯拒絕參加而逕進行主持召開對日和會。該刋並指陳美國將在和會中提出如下之建議，美國代表團將奉命促致非報復性之和平，務使廢止軍政之日本，能獲經濟上之生存，而成爲遠東之安定因素。日本政府將獲每一機會，得向盟軍總部表達其對各項和約條款之意見，而由盟軍總部轉達和會。美國將提議和約中，不得載列給付賠款之條款，美國且準備放棄其本身之賠償要求，並將敦促其他國家亦同樣放棄要求。</p>
<p>〔合業社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國務院今日宣佈：遠東委會十一會員國除蘇聯外，均贊成依據美國所建議之方針，舉行初步對日和會。除中法兩國外，美國已接獲其他所有國家之正式答復，中法兩國亦已非正式表示贊成，中國且主張對日和會應在上海而非美國所建議之華府或舊金山舉行。</p>

<h3>社論　豈容荷蘭一意孤行？</h3>
<p>自荷蘭於廿一日向印尼共和國用兵以來，我們不僅爲我國百萬僑胞担憂，恐將遭到「城門失火殃及池魚」之命運；而且也爲南洋的和平憂慮。據法國新聞社的報導，自荷蘭向印尼發動大規模的攻勢之後，蘇門答臘北部棉蘭之華僑區，已被焚毁；此在三賓壠之華僑區，亦遭軍隊洗劫。消息傳來，格外加深我們劉於僑胞生命財產安全的關切。同時又據美國合衆社的報導，荷蘭以印荷衝突係屬內政不容他國置喙爲理由，已拒絕中國出面調處：這一個消息如果是事實，則我們對於荷蘭當局在印尼的一意孤行，不能不表示萬分的遺憾了！</p>
<p>第一，中國對於印荷衝突，不僅直接受其影響，使我國百萬儒胞遭到「城門失火殃及池魚」的厄運；而且也間接受其影響，足以擾亂亞洲的和平；所以不論在何種情況之下，不論荷蘭對印尼用兵有如何充分的理由，中國終是不能袖手旁觀的；而且中國對於印尼問題，並沒有偏袒任何一方面的意向，只希望雙方能採取外交談判的方式，獲得和平解決的辦法，使雙方都能相安無事。我們在林伽牙蒂協定簽字時，曾表示非常的快慰，其後雙方因混合憲兵問題，不能解決，以致談釗陷於僵局，我國政府卽表示非常的關切並曾訓令駐巴達維亞總領事蔣家棟，需力調處印荷糾紛：以免再度引起戰禍；但是結果仍不免發生衝突，我國外交部又訓令蔣總頒事，繼續就地努力，最好能出面調處，化干戈爲玉帛，藉以維護百萬僑胞的安全以及亞洲的和平。這種好意與苦心，不僅未能爲荷蘭政府所諒解：而且竟拒絕我國的調處。荷蘭這種一意孤行的行爲，必然引起我國人民的憤怒；同時我們關切印尼的心情，也勢必增加，我們決不因荷蘭的拒絕而袖手旁觀；相反的我們還要繼續努力，中國在聯合國安全理事會中，是亞洲唯一的常任理事國，自可代印尼將印荷衝突，訴諸聯合國機構，促成國際的共同干涉。</p>
<p>第二，荷蘭必須重視國際的與情，不僅英美兩國對於荷蘭在印尼用兵，認爲不智；就是亞洲各國，對於荷蘭軍隊開到亞洲來屠殺印尼人民，無一不表示憤慨，印度國民大會尼赫魯，早已公開指出，荷蘭對印尼用兵，對於亞洲，實爲一大侮辱；並表示印度將以一切可能的方法，援助印尼作戰到底；澳洲前天也有許多大學生在荷籣領事館門前示威，對於荷蘭在印尼用兵，表示抗議；此在中國人民，對於荷蘭採用高壓政第，或以武力威脅印尼，也一致認是荷蘭的自絕於印度。亞洲各國人民的怒吼，荷蘭當局怎能置若罔聞？英國工黨機關報每日民聲報，也認爲荷印衝突對於世界經濟，實爲一大損失，其結果不僅使印尼的資源消耗殆盡，而且使荷印兩國將來合作，更加困難。這些珍貴的言論，荷蘭當局都應該特別重視而加以考慮的。</p>
<p>第三，荷蘭政府在印尼所採取的現行政策，雖經荷蘭議會通過，共產黨的提議立卽停止戰爭行動，雖該議會否決，但是荷蘭的政局，仍在動湯不定的狀態之下，不僅有共產黨堅決反對荷蘭對印尼用兵，就是一般開明的人士，也無不認爲荷蘭對印尼採取帝國主義對待殖民地的辦法，遲早必歸於失敗。我們站在第三者的立塲，平心而論，荷蘭對印尼用兵，在戰爭開始的階段，或能獲得順利的進展；但是將來事實必能證明印尼好比是一個「泥沼」，使荷蘭陷在泥沼裏永不能自援。</p>
<p>要之，我們環顧目前的國際形勢，再看荷蘭國內的政局；荷蘭對印尼用兵，絕對是一種不智的舉動，荷蘭社會黨中，也不乏明智之士，怎能引導荷蘭走上自殺的途徑而不能自覺呢？要知世界各國，不論是英美或亞洲各國，都是不容荷蘭在印尼一意孤行的。</p>
<h3>上海市民的一大攷騐</h3>
<p>上海各界人民團體，於本月廿日，舉行剿共建國勞軍大會，當塲決議，發起萬元勞軍運動，並定於今天起，開始勸募工作。前天籌備會開會，也決定了幾項具體辦法，不僅切實可行，而且顧念到民生疾苦，預定捐款的總額爲百億；這一筆數目，不可謂不大，但是只要勸募有方，有錢者踴躍捐輪，所謂「集腋成裘」，當不難達到百億的目的。</p>
<p>這次勸募萬元勞軍辦法的最大特色，乃在完全聽這人民的自動與自願，絕對不帶有絲毫强迫性質，更不採取攤派的方式。籌備食所以要採取這種辦法，由我們看來，實有兩種深長的意義。</p>
<p>第一，萬元勞軍的作用，不在乎人民捐出一萬元或十萬元，而在人民眞正了解剿共建國的意義。老實說，中國的政治經濟所以攪到這種地步，全國人民的生計所以痛苦到這種情形，完全是典匪一手所造成的。共匪是國內一切的亂源，它企圖毁滅國家光明燦爛的前途，而欲在全國紊亂民不聊生的情况之下，奪取政權；假如沒有我們的忠勇的將士在前綫浴血作戰，就是在上海的人民，也不能像現在那樣度着亞常的生活；關於這一點，美國隨着魏德邁將軍來華的事實調查團一到了中國，就看得出中國政治經濟的病根，乃在共產黨的威脅，使政府不能實行大規模的社會的經濟的改革。所以今後中國的唯一的出路，只有像「壯士斷腕」一樣，努力戡亂；在後方的人民，切不可忽視剿共工作的重要性。剿共不成，建國就無法進行。吳市長在勞軍大會中演說，「剿共與抗戰有同樣的重要。」這句話，最値得全上海人民深思的。</p>
<p>第二，上海是我國唯一的通商大埠，也就是我國工商業的中心，當有不少的富有之家，本着「有力出力，有錢出錢」的原則，富有之家應該多多捐款；俾對於在前綫出入於生死之間的將士，作一有力的表示，鼓勵他們爲入民戡亂，但是上海在另一方面，也有許多食不飽衣不能蔽體的貧苦市民，他們雖然也明瞭目前的國家大事，甚至其愛國心，並不在任何人之下；但是困於經濟，力不從心，對於勞軍運動，在金錢不能有所獻捐。我們應該顧及民生疾苦，聽其自然，決不能强人所難。非敎他們捐款不可。</p>
<p>要之，上海不論在經濟上政治上文化上，都是全國的首善之區，這次勞軍運動，能否達到百億的目的，實爲上海市民的一大玫騐！</p>

<h3>國行張總裁由京返滬　暢談財政經濟問題</h3>
<p>改革幣制非短期間所能實現　對日貿易決不放鬆管制手續</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行總裁張嘉璇，昨已由京返滬，渠經政府指定爲我與美特使魏德邁將羣接洽五代表之一。承語記者，魏使任務在收集中國軍事政治經濟各項資料，吾政府方面，正在積極收集各項有關資料。如財政經濟等各項，均在收集中，以便魏氏返國報吿杜羅門總統。國行行員負責編製金融部門材料。（一）關於幣制問題，政府不斷縝密研究中，但改革二字，必須有充份之準備，非短期間可倉卒從事。（二）美對華貸款事，仍在繼續接洽中。（三）開放對日貿易，問題關係重大，現尙在研究中。渠偶人認爲關係並不如何重大，因吾國對外貿易，現採取管制政策，任何國家商品進口，均須經過事先核准手續，對吾國不必需要之物品，一律不准進口。將來對日貿易，亦當如此。惟工業原料，極爲缺乏，其出品尙難在國外市塲競爭。何稱物品，我有需要，何稱物品，我無需要，均宜詳加研究，米便完全放任。（四）此次赴京，已與農部商妥。對於華北，擬按十萬噸，源源接濟，由上海以巨額麵粉，交換北方煤斤。首批三十萬包麵粉，現已開始運往北方。（五）華南走私問題，最近略見好轉。香港當局，逐步與我合作，現象尙佳。華南輸出入管理委員會人事均已決定，不久即將成立，積極展開工作。（六）第三期選口限額，定下月公布，其數字與上期相較，無大出入。分配數額，正俟全國經委會核定中云。</p>

<h3>堅後轉疲情况恍惚　華股漲勢遭阻遏　永公會一再升達限度</h3>

<p>晨開見高，良以隔前交換，國行差出數更巨，人心成奔向榮。遞永紗以二三八元開後，八九號一三〇號一六〇號一四一號即賣到二三三元，八號二二三號二二四號一七一號有納，升至二四四元。二三五號四號一四二號脫手，降至二三五元，一二號六五號六一號一一〇號八三號二四號復進至二四三元，一五二號一五七號二三四號賣出，一二號一三三號二一八號買進，而在二四〇元內外徘徊不定。二三五號二三二號二三四號賣出，低至二三五元以下，四五號二〇七號一〇六號銀行買意甚股，一九號七八九號亦買。十時十分，永公現遲均由三二號掛高至漲停限度，遞永紗漲到二四七元，一六〇號二二三號賣到二三七元，一〇六號四五號金融帮以及紗花帮六一號仍進，復升至二四四元。</p>
<p>十時五十分後，二二四號九一號一八三號九四號一六〇號五二號一五二號紛售，遞永紗乃跌至二二七元低價，散戶吸納，補空殷切，一七一號二三五號九五號二〇七號四號三二號七六號一四號八九號一八五號三六號一〇二號六九號一五三號紛紛吸納，短時間中，忽起反動，遞永紗急切回好到二四八元高價。一〇五號一七七號一八六號八五號一四二號一五二號紛紛脫手，仍吿不支。美亞景福新光華豐等更現低價，永紗午收以二三〇元及二三二元結束。收後喊價稍穩。</p>

<p>麵粉升沉不一，洋粉續升二三千元，廠粉亦加二三千元。雜牌粉平平之局，統粉去化不振，下挫一二千元，麩皮銷消有動，回漲三五百至千元不一。豆餅廠方執貨者扳價甚堅，回漲三四千元元。</p>
<p>營口餅猛加五六千元，惟實銷依然寥寥，形成呆漲之格。黃豆連跌之後，油廠轉辦，本街隨之吸進，陳豆轉昂三五千元。惟新豆則湘鄂浙贛均有到貨，欲漲乏力，暫呈平定之勢。</p>
<p>蠶豆久疲之後，零化略動，微升三四千元，赤豆來去兩少，無甚榮辱。菉豆依然平疲，莞豆汕頭進胃尙可，市勢挺立，苞米立定，芝蔴彷彿，生仁南洋採購，頓形活躍，猛漲一二萬元。元麥平正，小委廠家客方背道而馳，擯而不開。</p>

<p>各種內銷茶，昨本街及客帮去化依然　接，市勢迭吐秀氣。至於洋莊峯市，交易仍不比隔“生色，良　隊低檔陳祁門，午昌茶葉公司活動不戰外，他若抽珍珍眉等綠茶，本市出口商鑒於最近擬運銷非洲摩洛哥之九百噸花色，需額漸足，乃大都無意搜求也。惟過程仍因賣戶售意緊俏，依然靜中帶堅。</p>
<h3>呢羢業歇夏　毛織物趨勢平穩</h3>
<p>毛織物呢羢嗶嘰趨勢，近仍穩平無榮辱。夏令貨因銷日已過，無一不回跌，秋冬貨因到產與存底枯簿，廠方定價高昂，及中紡開價步貴關係，始終堅挺。實地交易，零　倶見清淡，買買雙方，先後均在晒霉歇夏中。</p>

<h3>共軍洗刧北票</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員勁風</p>
<p>錦州廿一日航訊</p>
<p>煉焦專家遇害</p>
<p>六月裏，東北燒起來紅了半邊天的戰火，瀋陽長春間，火車走不通，代替的是騾馬大車，東北的眼睛—小豐滿，由於電力放不出來，有因蓄水無法排洩造成了崩潰的情勢；西安，本溪，北票，礦區停工，各城市的工業，也都直接間接停的停，歇的歇。</p>
<p>東北共軍第五次的攻勢，造成了東北窒息局面、這次攻勢的尾聲，更發生一樁慘跌事件，那就是北票煉焦專家兪再麟先生的被殺害，暴屍四天，戰事過去了，剩下的是兪再麟糢糊的頭顱，和下體不全的十三根骨頭</p>
<p>遼西的北票，是一個有名的賤煤礦區，那裏一個大發電廠更關係着阜新·錦州·錦西的工礦事業。</p>
<p>北票的煤，是國內有數的煉焦煤質，已經證明了的埋藏量，在二萬萬公噸以上，淸末，民初，再早一些，都是零星的採用，民國十年，官商合辦公司，正式開發，九一八事變前，煤礦每日最高產量，已達二千五百噸左右，九一八後，到三十四年八月十五日，日人十四年的經營，最高日產量，是四千餘噸。</p>
<p>日本投降了，礦上設備，先經蘇軍搬運，後有共軍破壞，三十五年一月初旬，國軍進入北票，同月中旬，經濟部</p>
<p>派員接收，當時中日職員有千多人，工人約八千人，鑛廠機器，器材，旣然大都搬運走了，屋舍和電力設備，又大規模遭受破壞，復工後，每日生產量减到了百餘噸</p>
<p>同年，十月，改由資源委員會經營，設北票煤礦有限公司，經過員工努力，修理機器，補充器材，採辦物質，到了本年六月間，已大有可觀，煤的日產量，已經達到一千五百噸，本年預定，、四十萬噸產額，本可提早究成的不幸的又遭到了這次的劇變！</p>
<p>過去，已經經過了共軍四五次的攻佔，破壞，搬遷，冠山，三寳，南票等礦，損失都大，鑛區附近，更幾乎沒天沒有共軍侵擾的情報，賴着員工各站崗位，努力生產，渡過了重重難關。</p>
<p>這次，日期是六月廿六日早晨四點鐘。遭到大部</p>
<p>共軍圍攻，兇猛情形，打破歷次侵攻記錄，同時鑛區和外界交通咽喉所在地—金嶺寺鐵路大橋，先被共軍控制，礦廠職工，進退無路，總經理雷寳華，在錦州請兵，這時廠內負責人有職工，處長丁耀中，總務處長張慶春，工務處長兪再麟等，親率礦警官兵，拚死抵抗，以待援軍。</p>
<p>廿九日，駐礦國軍的一部被共軍繳械，七月一日午前，最後一部國軍，又被繳械，該礦礦警七百餘人，因彈藥用盡，死亡甚衆，遂於七月一日和全礦職員同時被俘，工程處處長兪再麟，當時被殺害，其他高中級職員，丁耀中·張慶春等人員五十餘人被俘</p>
<p>全礦於七月一日午後二時失陷，共軍在北票八天，將所有可能搬動的工作機器，工具，和採礦用物質器材，像煤車·滾珠·安全燈·炸藥·雷管·電汽·馬達·鋼板·鋼條等，搬運一空，因爲援軍開來，知不可留，遂在八日午後捆帶</p>
<p>被俘人員退去，救援礦區國軍，被阻滯中途，七月九日，纔得進入北票。</p>
<p>今天，礦區已經收復，重大的電廠等設備，誰幸未被毀壞，但人員·器材·自衛武力，全部損失，員工因生命失卻保障，工程首腦人員，又被擄去，都萬分灰心，不願再冒險前往。</p>
<p>現在礦方正請求急賑，安撫流亡員工，遣送被俘人員眷屬，另組成臨時機構，在礦區維持一切，陸續運糧款，安定工人，至於如何復工，因爲難關重重，那要有兩個月以後了！</p>
<h3>台灣水災</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>台北二十日航訊</p>
<p>合灣幾乎沒一年沒有災殃：風災，水災，這些自然的災害，阻礙了工程的進行，破壞了旣成的建設，加深了農民大衆生活的苦難。政府在建設的同時，就得準備和建設費同等的　修費，要不然只有求建設的一勞永逸，但過去日本人沒法這樣做，接收以後的當局，更無法担負雙重的建設費。</p>
<p>本省五月下旬到六月旬下整整的一個月間，全島浸在雷雨裏，這情形却更甚於內地的黃霧時節。因爲雷雨，帶來的是溪流湧急，堤防潰決，結果演變成田禾淹沒，家畜房屋流失破壞，村民死傷，加以山洪暴發，山崩地裂，直接破壞了道路橋樑，阻塞了交通。據總計所示，五月二十四日至六月十六日這二十二天的降雨量爲一·二六五·八公厘，超出了卅五年同年降雨量。以台中縣論，六月間連續降十二天的降雨量計七七四·三公厘，為數十年來所未見。</p>
<p>這美次水災中情勢最嚴重的是合中縣。該縣複查結果的換失數字是：（一）堤防崩壞潰決計六十一處；（二）土地埋沒流失五萬畝，（三）人民死二一人，傷九一人；（四）家畜牛羊豬死六八〇隻；（五）家屋被害計一八二六戶，（六）財產，稻穀，蕃薯曁交通損失；總價値是·五八五五·二〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>一個老年的參議員在魏主席召開的座談會上大聲疾呼的說：在都市裏看不到災情的，在災區裏看到了，其慘狀却令人不忍目覩。當記者們隨魏主席視察烏溪的決堤時，導引的人說，這祗不過一個決口，有很多決口都亟待搶修，農民都在哀求救濟，搶修。</p>
<p>據公共工程局水利組調查，全省有一一一處堤防發生問題，包括台中，新竹，台南，高雄，東台南灣，冲毀長度計九六五六m：缺口長度也達七五八九m·大部份是堤脚，堤坡，冲毁，崩決，和缺口。</p>
<p>災荒是足以測騐民衆的羣力和政府的關心。台灣同胞在這一表現上，是達高潮的。台中水災發生後，縣參議會和政府便成立了水災緊急救護委員會，先向縣內銀行借款搶修，以免溪流再漲，擴大缺口。同時迅捷地辦理損害調查，救濟工作。在財力支絀之下，教濟費需一千三百萬元，省縣補助外，幷發動各鄉鎭募捐，發給災民衣服，伙食費：死亡撫恤金等，情緒緊張得一如救火。在堤防的搶修上，公共工程局及縣府土木科的工程人員，予以技術上的合作，並發補助費，缺口部份堤防採用筍形簍築擋水壩及臨時堤防，冲毀部份以竹蛇簍搶修，其中霧峯缺口，每日動員工人五百名搶修，沒幾天就完成。</p>
<p>公路和鐵路，直接遭遇到損害。可是由於緊急搶修，通車時並沒長久的躭誤，在台灣是可以看到緊急完成加工監製的情景的，工程技術人員在這時是絕好的試鍊。</p>
<p>沒有水利，就沒有台灣，台灣是經過日本人用人工構築的水利，始建設成一個盛產蔗糖，米糧菓實的島嶼。任何機械的科學的力量，都無法改變海島的地形。中央山脈這分水嶺，一下雨就像倒注似的急流入海，旣短湍，又危急，過去洧防水有造林的計劃防雨，現在壓根兒可還沒動，看樣子，要憑人為的力量來防範自然的災厄，是一天天困難了！</p>
<p>水災還是本年度災情的第一頁，隨時可在太平洋上席捲而來的颭風，正伸着它的廢手，會衝過氣象合的預報網，冷不防的向海鳥襲擊！</p>

<p>煉焦專家兪再麟，字醉令，今年卅九歲。浙江嵊縣東鄕典岡村人。民國廿一年七月畢業於天津國立北洋工學院，歷充開灤礦務局實習員，建設委員會技佐，國防設計委員會及齊源委員會礦室助理研究員，經濟部礦冶研究所技士。卅一年十一月奉派赴美老察，卅四年四月歸國，任天府礦業公司洗焦廠主任。勝利後，調任經濟部東北特派員辦公處接收專員，先後派赴長春及撫順礦務局工作。卅五年十二月調任北票煤礦公司工程處長，服務礦冶界達十五年，老成特重，爲國內有數之冶煉專家，著作頗爲宏富。父母早故，遺妻及三子二女，現均在浙江嵊縣原籍，家無恒產，身後蕭條。兪氏係於七月一日午後二時北票煤礦失陷時，慘遭殺害。暴屍至七月九日該礦收復，始經收殮，因被鳥獸啄食，僅剩頭顱及骨殖十二段，幾至無法辨認，厥狀至慘。現遺骸已運至錦州重行裝殮，並定八月一日舉行追悼大會。（勁風寄自錦州）</p>
<h3>廣西農業全貌　從荒土走向綠洲</h3>
<p>— 本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>梧州廿日航訊</p>
<p>荒涼的沙漠，也許不會開放美麗的花朵結下茁壯的時實，然而在荒土上拓植的勞動者，往往使人感到地無上的佩慰。廣西地處南陲，自有秦開疆，便已是荒凉得那末可怕，幾千年來，流徙桂嶺的人們用雙手開拓了生產的大路，到今天止，不毛之地已經從不毛走向綠洲。</p>
<p>廣西的農業，惟東南大河一帶可以呌得上稍有出產，西北一隅，荒山萬疊，蠶烟千里，除了倚山爲田，勉强種植一些包粟，甘薯以作一年食糧之外，可謂一無所有，所以人民的生活也就過得特別苦，長年不見粒米，僅以雜糧充飢者，爲數在百分之十五以上，荒年一至，山洪爆發，山谷作物即被一掃而空；偶遇旱魅，山地水源最易枯竭，所以每逢災害，桂西北一隅的同胞也就特別死得快，死得慘，說起來何堪浩嘆！</p>
<p>米豆粟著　下濟粵港</p>
<p>東南一帶農產，雖然算不上豐盛可貴，但是每年辛勤收益，其數亦有可觀，如果能够迅速改善生產方法，减少天然人爲災害，前途亦正可觀。產品釭米，豆，粟，薯，花生等項，如果不逢歉收，均有極大剩餘，從而下濟粵，港等地，去今兩年，湘粵大飢，如果不是桂米濟遝，恐怕後果將會更形嚴重，以自己鬧荒的糧食，還要攤一份給別人，人民的辛苦，可以想見。沿江流域，百分之六十五是水田，自南寗以迄梧州的東南半壁中，大抵年收兩造（七月一次，十月一次），約在千四百萬担左右，供銷全省，遠及港澳粵各地，今年慘遭洪水，損失不下二萬畝，鎭邊等縣農民竟有被迫到全家自殺的，一米下腹，實不勝其辛酸！</p>
<p>五種植物　萬民所賴</p>
<p>稻豰雜糧之外，為了桂省境內多屬丘陵地帶及亞熱帶氣候，所以依靠其他作物爲生的農民，亦不在少，舉凡棉，蔴，菸，蔗，桐油，近年來都有甚爲可觀的出產，倚賴這五株植物吃飯的人，數逾四百萬人。</p>
<p>產棉區域　四百萬畝</p>
<p>棉花的出產只不過是民國廿五年後爲人注意桂西南一帶是植棉區的事，所以遠比不少陝西江浙的產量，然而產棉區域亦己於十年內迅速增至四百餘萬畝，年產一百一十二萬四千餘担，產地分佈在珠江流域上游一帶，每年出產，加工製成棉紗，即行運銷內地，遠及雲貴，成爲家庭手工業的最大泉源，桂林土布的美觀耐用，抗戰時期留居大後方的人，大概總會有一個很深的印象，其次如桂東的平樂，賀縣，鬱林一帶，紡織業亦極發達，部分婦女竟有以終身嫁與機杼而不適人者，亦可霑足度生。最近建設當局爲謀發展全省輕工業，特地先從紡織業着手，投鉅資在王林等地組設紡織業生產合作社，以爲規範。</p>
<p>苧蔴產量　遜於棉花</p>
<p>至於藏田產最遠不及棉花發達，只有桂北及桂西一帶約有蔴田四十五萬五千餘畝，每年約可出產六十萬餘担左右，苧蔴的市塲，則集結於桂東的平樂等地，大部均向外省輸出，因爲質素尙符改良，所以銷路甚微。</p>
<p>種菸發財　每担廿萬</p>
<p>在廣西，今年種菸的人都發了財，一担菸葉，可以得價廿餘萬元，而且商人還是得之惟恐不遑，估計全省菸葉銷路，可獲收益一千億元，外匯價高，洋烟銷路日蹇之際，貴陽，廣州等地紛紛設廠自製，廣西境內昔日倒閉的烟廠亦紛紛東山再起，以與外烟爭一日之短長，就地取材，於是菸草身價十倍，加以今年收穫又豐，所以稍可開眉者，惟菸農而己，產烟地段，當以桂北爲多，約三十餘萬畝。</p>
<p>大烟問題　方生未死</p>
<p>從一個烟字而想及許多問題，往往使人極增神秘之感，菸烟以外的大烟，在桂西北的山野中，似乎尙有在再生而未死的狀態裏，雖然儘管法令把一個「死」字放在人的頭上，然而許多人都感覺錢字比「死」字更有興趣，今春各地動手剷烟，天河一縣一剷便是十萬株，派到桂滇黔邊界去做縣長的幾乎沒有一個不是爲烟丟官，西隆，西林等縣，罌粟種在路旁亦無視於中，熬好膏丸，在桂西以每兩十五萬元成交，沿江東下，越下利也越長，所以桂西的小都市百色，也就適與其會的變成了冒險家的樂園，如果罌粟也列入農產的時候，不禁使人想起了半年前的西康……。</p>
<p>製糖工業　堪為表率</p>
<p>在廣西，比較爲人熱稔的工業品，只有製糖業堪爲表率，自南寗經貴縣以迄桂平大湟江口，堪稱甜城，綿延此地的蔗田達二二三三三三畝，年產蔗糖六百七十萬祖，其中尤以貴縣一地，省府曾於民國廿五年在此建立全國最大規模的糖廠，延聘外籍技師，從事大量生產，後雖因戰事爲敵機炸平，但己建立了廣西的製糖業基礎”如今省方正力謀恢復，前途殊可樂觀，目前貴縣各地小型糖廠林立，每年傾銷桂北·湘·黔·粵各地者，不下三百萬担，厥爲廣西小工業中最有希望的一途，可借今年洪水所至，虫　相繼，損失蔗田不可以數計，爲糖業中一大浩刼。</p>
<p>桐油產銷　漸趨抬頭</p>
<p>桐油的產銷，在戰前廣西亦頗負時譽，種地面積近廿五萬三千餘畝，年產卅一一萬八千餘担，外銷港粵者即達廿二萬担，佔產量百分之七十强，戰後外銷路斷，繼以戰火洗刦，所以幾至一蹶不振，但以桐油爲工業必需原料，所以戰時走私濟敵之風，盛極一時，成爲一大禍患。戰後基於國際市塲的需要，桐油業又復抬頭，雖然一時未能增產，但是當局已經積極注意提倡廣植，本省土地，百分之七十可以適於植桐，尤以桂西北等地，重山濯濯，赤野千里，即官有荒地亦迷四十萬畝，如果能够力加拓櫃，十年樹木，綠原龍葱之時，還怕甚麼永災旱魅？最可怕是一方面爲餓死的人流淚，一方面又不想一想餓死的人所以餓死之由，顧念國計民生，實在要及時努力。</p>
<p>茴香肉桂　普銷內外</p>
<p>此外，像桂南龍州一帶的特產，有茴香和肉桂，前者入藥榨油，雜爲八角油，年產一萬八千餘担，爲國藥珍品，後者每年亦產桂枝達四萬担，桂油七百餘担，銷及國內外，苟能細加改良，亦正有無限好處。</p>
<p>熱帶水菓　大量生產</p>
<p>等而下之，數到熱帶水菓也算得上應有盡有，北流，容縣等地菓園，有廣至數十里者，荔枝，龍眼，香焦，西瓜……都有大量出產，容縣沙田柚，更是舉國聞名，比諸福州文旦有過之而無不及。如果不是連年的災害，廣西實在不應該苦得那末可怕，然而事實上今日的廣西却深陷在飢餓的深淵裏，一年兵火，兩年水旱，農村經濟以山崩海裂之勢向下直倒，一粒穀裏面包着一顆淚珠，還要祖受着許多無名的苦痛，誰知道甚麼時候才有一塲豐收？</p>
<h3>大鵬灣洋面　豐慶輪　觸礁後焚燬</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者程志政</p>
<p>一號風球·難挽厄運　船主機警·外艦施救</p>
<p>香港廿三日航訊</p>
<p>財物：　蕩然無存</p>
<p>人命：　倖獲安全</p>
<p>自今春行駛港粵綫之「西安」輪，在香港發生大火，焚斃乘客百餘人後，海行旅客，莫不深具戒心，詎知本月十九日排水量六一六七噸之「豐慶」巨輪，又在由港赴汕途中深夜觸礁失事，該輪向駛星加坡·香港·汕頭·厦門航綫，此次由星埠載來歸國華僑幾二千人。慘劇發生時，正値颶風大作，一時風聲雨聲，與婦孺號哭求救聲和成一片，幸英美軍艦，飛駛往援，乘客均慶生還，惟公私財物，已全部損失，其中不少爲華僑多年辛勤之汗血，一旦蕩然無存，倍覺悽慘萬分。</p>
<p>豐慶輪原爲德國太子郵船公司所有，第一次世界大戰後，列爲美國之戰利品，旋由美將該輪售予舊金山中國郵船公司，更名麗利，一九三三年和豐公司以七十五萬港元購得該輪，改名豐慶，行駛南洋航綫，第二次世界大戰發生，英政府即將豐慶征用，專在印度洋面遝輸軍實，兩度遇險均免於難，戰後仍駛原航綫，因係國輪，故爲僑胞所樂乘，生涯鼎盛，盈利極豐。聞國父生前，奔走革命，曾搭乘該輪赴美兩次，至今爲和豐公司所津津樂道。</p>
<p>遇颶風　船主機警</p>
<p>豐慶輪此次由星加坡駛港，共戴三千餘人，除在港登岸者不計外，計赴汕頭者六百三十人，赴厦門者五百八十人，連同小孩，約爲一千四百餘人，外加船員小販等，總數近二千人。於十八日下午七時離港，半小時後香港海關即掛出一號風球。（如該輪定於七時半以後啓椗，則因颶風將至，勢必將行期展緩）惜船已開出，不及折返，至十九日晨三時五十分，狂風大作，巨浪如山，該輪正駛至大鵬灣洋面，不勝暴風衝擊，遂致觸礁，當時船主爲保全乘客生命計，乃于觸礁後，繼續前駛，蓋前進之結果，船身雖裂，仍可擱之礁上，如打倒車，則全船有立即沉沒之虞，因船王之機警果斷，二千人之生命，盡獲保全，可謂不幸中之大幸矣。</p>
<p>船身裂　哭聲震天</p>
<p>記者為明瞭出事後之實際情形起見，特訪問遇險歸來之乘客陳爲雄君，據吿：船離港後，即有風浪，入夜後乘客成早入睡鄕，渠亦以顚簸過甚，不覺頭眩，午夜風勢更緊，暴雨驟臨，約三時餘，忽聞隆然巨響，余即躍起，步至艙面，時船上鑼聲大作，蓋已觸礁遇險矣。全船電炬通明，秩序大亂，婦孺哭聲震天，爭奪救生圈，驚悸之狀，難以描述。船身既擱礁上，巨浪衝擊，漸裂爲三段，頭部朝天，餘均下沉。乘客咸集船頭，靜待死神之降臨。余之皮鞋，亦於慌亂中失落，行李七件，悉數落海。</p>
<p>三兵艦　奮勇施救</p>
<p>十九晶晨六時，適一俄國商船「拿荷打」號經過，知豐慶遇難，乃駛近記法營救，無如風勢甚厲，又多礁石，俄輪不敢駛近，六時三十分，始見英艦「哈特」號疾駛而來，最初該艦擬用過船方法，靠近豐慶，兩次泊近，鋼纜均爲大風所折斷，不得已由該艦用小艇施救，每艇容十餘人，婦孺最先，老弱次之，秩序尙佳，嗣美艦「鶴金司」「福斯」兩艦於八時駛到，十一時太古公司「湖南」輪亦來，乃協力施救，由英兵守扶梯，以防擁擠，惟中間一度以船身將傾，後立者搶先欲出，秩序大亂，英艦乃以化學彈之機關槍向向「豐慶」掃射，衆乃稍定，至晚七時半、全部乘客，均平安離船登艦返港。</p>
<p>獲生還　財物盡失</p>
<p>陳君到港時，隨同其他乘客，由和豐公司，送至陶園暫時收容。記者嗣入陶園視察，見千餘僑胞，席地而坐，一身以外，已無長物，蓋軍艦於救生時，對於大小行李，一律不准携帶即小至包袱，亦須擲入海中，華僑之中，有不少在外工作數十年，携眷返里退休者，此次生命倖獲保全，惟財物全失，歸里後何以爲生，悲戚之情，形諸顏色，亦云慘矣。</p>
<p>殘骸焚　禍不單行</p>
<p>和豐公司對於善後問題，已決定免費遺送汕頭廈門乘客回里，另發每人旅費港幣五十元。至於行李損失，公司以事出非常，且本身已損失不貲，無法賠償，被難歸僑，刻正向港政府請願，要求救濟，尙無結果。至豐慶尙未沉沒之殘骸，忽又起火焚燬，料係海盜掠刼後縱火所致，眞所謂禍不單行也。</p>
<h3>豫宜陽煤礦大慘劇　百餘工人葬身窰底</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員博泉</p>
<p>開封廿二日航訊</p>
<p>豫省宜陽煤礦，產量豐富，煤質亦佳，自安陽豐樂鎭焦作等處各大煤礦被共軍先後破壞後，當局對於宜陽煤礦極爲注意。該縣李溝礦塲，於三十五年六月，由宜洛煤礦工程處開採以來，日夜加工，不遺餘力，數月之間，每日出煤達二百噸之多。因此，該工程處極力於礦穴下路道擴充，但地面井眼，僅有兩處，空氣旣不流通，設備又極簡陋，對於工人安全，向來不大注意，一遇空氣窒息，軋手無策，聽其待斃，鮮聞有改善之舉。七月三日夜十二許，礦穴中突發生爆炸之聲，響澈雲霄，水旱工人一百四十六人，經及時逃出者四十一人，負輕重傷者三十七人，尙有一百餘人，均壓在窰底，生死不明。截至四日下午三時，尙未想出急救辦法，殊堪焦慮。此次不幸事件，僉認爲設備簡陋所致。被害家屬一片哀號聲，聞之酸鼻。</p>

<h3>論電影藝術</h3>
<p>— 閻哲吾</p>
<p>電影藝術的進步，已超越過去各種藝術的成就，他是廿世紀新生藝術的小妹妹，比戲劇更綜合而更曠達，有人說他是「第八藝術」。的確的，自從電影藝術的究成，宇宙，人生俱形成奇異的變幻，我們欣賞電影藝術本身的賜予，此外，更發現到她對人類在哲學上的宇宙觀人生觀的「眞價」。—這眞價顯示着電影藝術別乎其他藝術的特質。</p>
<p>科學與藝術的一體</p>
<p>電影的發明，非若其他藝術純賴乎人工，他不像雕塑之單靠刀刻，音樂之單靠管弦，繪畫之單靠彩色筆桿，他的成長過程却是一連串的科學發明與進步。</p>
<p>電影原於照相術之發明，「呆片」進而述續，產生了「幻燈」，幻燈進而有了「活動寫眞」，終於完成故事式的默片—無聲電影。</p>
<p>更從科學上的發現，由於音波之變爲光波，光波回射出聲浪，無聲電影進而成爲有聲。</p>
<p>再由天然色片的產出，彩色電影獨覇了現階段的世界電影市塲，受到廣大人民的愛護。</p>
<p>從視覺聽覺滿足而外，「氣息快感」將由電影放映上噴射，電影將又成爲有色有香的藝術欣賞！</p>
<p>上面的推演敘述，證明這藝術天地的開展却由於科學的賜予。科學的成就正是藝術的成就，把過去認爲與藝術對立的科學，如今却結合成爲一體，在科學的領域中開放了炫爛的藝術蓓蕾！這不能不算是宇宙間的新猷。</p>
<p>時間與空間的交織</p>
<p>戲劇是立體的三乘積的時空藝術，電影，雖然也限於一定的空間—銀幕上—但其表現却仍是立體的事物現象，亦屬時空三乘的產物。銀幕與舞臺有同樣地效能，在有限長的時間空間內，表現出無限長的時化與空間裏所發生的事象。這種縮短了時間上「過去」「現在」與「未來」的距離，復縮小了空間上宇宙中的天地—東，西，南，北，—各個地地帶！</p>
<p>不僅如此，宇宙現象乃一變基之大流，時空便是宇宙萬象的間本架子。在任何藝術的表達上必受空間的局限；電影的編製境界獨包羅萬有，宇宙一切全可收入鏡頭，不受任何的阻撓。瞬息間可從莽原轉向海洋，更從熱帶轉入寒帶。現實了莎士比亞的名言。「世界一舞臺，人生即戲子」。電影取材的曠達性是超越了任何藝術的。</p>
<p>還有，「時間」的變動，在有限大的銀幕園地—方丈之間—仍有其無限的廣大。時間常形成空間的動之軌跡，電影的神奇，却把時間透過空間而推進，使想像中的若干空間座標盡收在「一個」不變的「空間」裏。</p>
<p>至於人生的時序，在水銀燈下，往往可以隨意變調，有時先拍攝了「結婚」的塲面，而後才「訂婚」，這種「時間底空間」的跳躍，突破了凡庸的生命程序，也是電影藝術的偉大創造。</p>
<p>動與靜的相對</p>
<p>宇宙萬物，生生不已，所以宇宙本是一個變化的流，而時閩使以變爲本性；因時間無不在樊，宇宙萬物便無不在動，事實上所記「靜」不過是「動」的相對的名詞，那只是具有一種物質情性的存在而已。這種哲理如果認爲玄妙，却可以電影來作證明。</p>
<p>人類的「動作」，無　是　一個姿態變換到另一個姿態的過程之連續的表現。照相常是物謐　性「片時存在」的「呆影」，「動」常由此種連續的個體「靜」的「呆影」在短速時間裏連續變換的結果；一分鐘裏可獲換十六張呆片，這十六張靜的不同的姿　，連續地在燈光下照映起來，便形成「動作」，而付與了生命。所以電影藝術無非是說明宇宙間「靜」與「動」的關係而已。</p>
<p>在電影攝製的技術方面，有許多「快攝」「慢攝」等速度上的變化，從人生眞實動作與攝製時速度的變化「配合」，又可形成若干的幻象，這幻象常說明或解析了人生與自然事象。這也是電影的一大神奇。</p>
<p>電影放映在銀幕上，本體是一個靜的方丈空間；但這靜的內包，却藏着無數的「動」態！在火車上坐着的人似乎是靜體，但火車開着却是動體，這是愛因斯坦相對論的一例；相倣的電影藝術中表現的故事是個動體，但銀幕本身却是靜的，這彷彿說明了相對論的另一面。</p>
<p>本於此種「動」「靜」相對的觀感，所以電影的攝製常利用錯覺而顚倒了動靜的事物。比如攝製火車或飛機的走動，常在攝影塲裏拍攝，然後反以動的背景「複製」地襯托上去。放映起來觀衆反以爲火車在走動，飛機在飛行。這種欺騙觀衆的攝影技術便是深晤動和靜的相對性而造成；這又是電影藝術對宇宙觀念的一種說明。</p>
<p>夢幻與現實的聯結</p>
<p>夢幻常是相像的產物，想像常是可望而不可即的東西。在文藝的領域中，任何一種創作，不能把想像具體而微地立體地表現出來。因爲「理想」的頭縱然高昂在天上，「現實」畢竟只是地下的東西。但、自從有了電影，她却突破了往昔難關，把可望而不可即的事物，一體地且象地表達出來。比如難能說話，樹能生火，神飛雲海，妖迷聖侣，陸上行舟，海裂大這，由於電影藝術技巧的精進，克制了一切「難能」！在電影領域中沒有「難」之一字。一切夢幻均可成爲現實，足可滿足人格精神上的追尋，電影的三昧便在使人做那「白晝的夢」。他是人類精神的「黑暗之光」！電影藝術是值實中的夢幻，更是夢幻中的眞實！</p>
<p>尤其神幻的天下沒有人可以看到自己以外的自己，電影却可使演員坐在觀衆席上欣賞自己的創作。這不是人生的夢幻是什麼？然而這是「眞實」。</p>
<p>視覺與聽覺的極</p>
<p>任何一種藝術，皆供「視聽之娛」，但所謂視聽兩方面的享受，各種藝術却有其不同的重點！比如繪畫上有色彩的視覺之感受，音樂即祗屬聽覺之領略，舞台藝術已進至聲，光，綫條等綜合的表現，但終不及以科學爲援助而表達的電影藝術賜予之登峯造極！影利用電，光，聲，色直接的兼容，給予觀衆視聽感覺上以最大的事受！所謂「五彩立體電影」可謂是廿世紀感覺藝術中的新生驕子！</p>
<p>戲劇表演常以演員自己爲其藝術表達之工具，動的藝術創造常無法保存，但，有了電影，可彌補了這種缺陷！一次聚精會神驚人的表演常可傳之後世！所以電影又奪去了戲劇藝術尊貴的寳座！他完成了人類感覺李受的交響樂！</p>
<p>總這之，電影藝術在廿世紀擁有全世界人民的愛好，他的獨特性與普遍性値得讚美！而在藝術哲學上我們却又不得不求得他的成就之所以然！上面的解析，便是說明電彩藝術引人入於三昧境的綠由。</p>

<p>古人落筆，未有無來歷者。庾開府泳畫屛風詩：『竹動蟬爭散，連搖魚暫飛。』張燕公相州北亭詩：『萍散魚時舞，林幽鳥作歌。』蟬散鳥歌，语係習見，以飛舞言魚，似甚奇僻。然養魚經有：「魚無隨守，則乘雨飛去：』「漢書」亦有『宣帝東浮大河，神魚舞於河』之語，则「飛」「舞」一一字，亦非無自也。</p>
<h3>Ballet的敎</h3>
<p>— 寶迦</p>
<p>寶迦(Hagar　Degas　Sesg-1017）是印象派畫家之一，作品以人物居多，尤其善作粉畫。色彩嬌艷，筆觸輕鬆，品格高逸，此作足稱代表。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>漫談題畫</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>吾友牛鼻子黃堯兄，初扒桂林時曾囑以介紹二十位同行相聚小飲，其附帶條件爲須有「眞風趣者」，余期以不敏，蓋能畫者因如過江之鯽，解畫者直如鳳毛麟角，其腥膻相聚者，徒以聲息相吹，實不知「風趣」何在。</p>
<p>今重返春申，即鏤金刋　亦束諸高閣，以海上才人萃聚，不敢以臭皮匠冒充舟才，頂一塊風雅招牌，換取斗方名士以貽笑於鄭板橋之流，余雖不能畫，然頗好强做解人，偶與陸丹林兄談及中國畫，恒感流風漸悖、徒自鳴高，畫人每以聲色相喧，皮毛是尙，益覺北平玻璃廠亦不及今日上海畫壇生意眼之獨到也。（關於這方面，丹林兄已有書文論及，故略而不談。）</p>
<p>茲以畫題而言，每感覺不成名堂者亦揭　豎幟，相互標榜，凡畫事旣竟。題畫雖非點睛，亦可增損畫品，是以題畫產首重書法，次重文采，再次印章，三者缺一，便易落俗。李思訓山水若題以懷素狂草，則細緻畫面破壞無遺；是必以趙松雪董其昌之行草題四王山水，題摩詰詩、撝叔印。至於　　２畫，則反是，故缶老詩，書，畫，印四絕，缺一殆不可矣。</p>
<p>若題竹用「葉垂千口劍，枝聳萬條槍」，不特屁股可笞，直似對門王屠戶賣梅花，風雅得可笑也。又題畫最惡莫過賣弄聰明，昔年在滬曾見某畫家畫魚，題曰：「翩若驚鴻，蜿若游龍。」題得頗好，可惜畫蛇添足，下面畫一節尾巴曰：「摘自洛神賦」，如此玩弄小聰明，便有自高之議；目前能欣賞此題者，自必讀過半部文選之流，若謂恐隔壁王阿大不知出處，則點出洛神賦對於王阿大之流，勢必仍不知是何名堂也。</p>
<p>王靜安先生論詞以境界分上下，並倡隔與不隔之議，以之論題畫，亦甚相洽；前者竟分淸濁，後者實貼與不貼。偶閱「竹嫰　」有題：</p>
<p>『石邊品　低檀口，月下臨實聳翠　。』</p>
<p>品鳳已成死竹之勢，由弄王騐鷺而聯想及三寸翠翹，則匪夷所思，品格低下，直如東施效顰，捧心反惡。若：</p>
<p>「人家　烟樹，帆影落空江。」</p>
<p>『一簾疎雨侵堦綠，數葉春風逐指生。』</p>
<p>不見其畫而可知其品類，其品自高，前者山水，後者蘭竹，不問可知，後聯雖嫌味實，然題得不隔也算佳製，蓋以雨襯竹聲、風雲門　香，題，畫兩貼，便是不隔。</p>
<p>前赴靑年會宴，見有畫展俗惡不堪、其中描模四王南田，如小兒習帖，而榜書則爲「名書畫展」云云，自欺欺人，莫此爲甚，中國繪事一道，首重用墨，凝滯未化，曷可成家？勿怪稍懷潔癖者，終身鮮以畫展招徠矣。</p>
<p>吾爲此文，以畫人不應以驚名是尙，胸中多容三兩升墨水，出手自必不凡，否則畫人與畫匠之間，所差者實無法說出也。</p>
<h3>近百年書畫展之意義</h3>
<p>— 謝稚柳</p>
<p>上海市立美術館籌備處最近將舉辦近百年書畫展覽，百年的時期，自滿淸咸豐元年迄民國三十六年、這九十七年中的書畫家，在民國認識的人很多，就是在淸末，也與現在不少耆老是故舊親知。因此這個展覽，將與社會人士以格外親切的印象，</p>
<p>滿淸一代的書畫，盡人皆知是四王憚吳，彷彿除此以外，也就再沒有書畫了。但事實上四王惲吳確也籠罩了這一代，沒有人能超過這幾位的成就。這六十有一年的滿淸末葉，並不是一個發揚時期。</p>
<p>然而近百年間，實不乏聰明才智之士，與夫忠臣孝子，隱逸闔閣方外者流，也能在書畫上佔有一席地的。元朝所謂的士大夫畫（文人畫）越到後來，發揮得越普遍，除純粹的書畫家外，就是上面所說的以其他地位而從事書畫爲遊戲與寄託。這些作品，若從純粹舊畫講，則當然另有解釋，而以文物與歷史的眼光來看，要亦不能一律抹殺。本來論書畫，即以滿淸一代而言，也就在有可議之處，何况這區區不是發揚時期的近百年間。</p>
<p>這個展覽，將使人發傷逝懷舊之情，將使人獲得批評這一時期的證據，將使人趨於從事整理的道路，這只是一個開端。這個開端，將不僅僅是使人對這些作品贊嘆與傷感，嚴格與正直的批評，應該是這個展覽的最大意義與收穫。</p>
<h3>揮扇偶談</h3>
<p>— 定山</p>
<p>書扇之樂，無逾金面，自有一種奕奕王謝家丰采。但不可用粉拭，宜用細布輕擦，勿傷金面。否則墨黯光，精彩全失矣。</p>
<p>金面扇最可玩，明人金面尤多，余當聚之至百，戰時失去，近年喜聚四王吳惲，然有一難，蓋烟客廉州多金面，簏合石谷南田多白面，而墨井扇面可謂絕無僅有，遑論金白。</p>
<p>予嘗費三年之功得烟客廉州設色白扇面各一頁，烟客作湖上春，垂柳桃花，古豔無匹，廉州一頁設色全做香光，皆合作也。墨井求之三年，僅得竹石一頁，蔣氏密韻樓有一頁，亦聊聊修竹數筆耳。鐵琴銅劍樓有一頁，爲早年作，湖帆藏一頁，則山水也。平生所見墨井扇面，僅此可謂鳳毛麟角矣。</p>
<p>明人扇皆紅金面，淸初則用靑金，至康熙則皆用白扇。故收四王白扇面，烟客廉州較難，若收金面，則麓台石谷亦不易，有之皆四十以前作，無老年筆也。</p>
<p>扇節畫竹不宜作大幹粗葉。文山南田多作綠竹，尤爲秀雅。蓋緊頭出入懷袖，若藏舟負山，使人浹背，可取大力。</p>
<p>畫扇山水宜於水墨，不宜於靑綠；宜於平遠，不宜於壘煒。必使見者絛然意遠，在逸品妙品間。</p>
<p>宋人畫紈扇，雖互手筆若郭熙惠崇，皆作江天小景，不讓馬遙父夏禹玉輩專美也。</p>
<p>畫竹以少爲難，蓋在於分枝，而不在葉也。仲圭畫竹多如此，嘗見張葱玉所藏一幅，其紫僅三十七筆，不覺其少。夏太常繁枝累葉，雖多奚爲。</p>
<p>震荷自來無專家者，然唐解無惲南田皆有絕作。龐萊老藏惲田翁巨册，中有設色荷花一幀，以朱砂演粉作花，石靑石綠作葉，穠豔如先秦美人，非時世妝也。畫扇不宜用重色，畫荷獨能豔而不俗，柳屯田詞云：『奇葩異卉是深紅』。</p>
<p>近避著湖上，每於凌晨棹小舟，携紅翠入荷花深處，爲花寫照，聚之扇頭，求扇者輒於蘇小墳前隔水招呼，畫成即與，菱藕瓜果皆可易，固不必洛下牡丹千金始售耳。</p>
<p>扇骨以水磨竹不加鐫刻者爲最上，湘妃已俗，檀香則鮑市耳。海濱之夫乃多捨彼而取此，揮之於五都之市，雖有佳作，吾無以觀之。</p>
<h3>林心傳扇面個展</h3>
<p>— 錢君匋</p>
<p>我國的畫壇，可分爲二大壁壘。第一個壁壘就是中國畫，還有一個壁壘就是西洋畫。西洋畫在二十年前是非常蓬勃的到了現在，因環境關係，似乎已漸趨消沉，沒有二十年前那般的熱鬧了，倒是中國畫，向來就熟鬧的，一直到現在還沒有衰落，但把今日來比過去，則牠的「質」似乎也差得多了。</p>
<p>不過像上述所謂「質」的情形，也有例外的，在國畫方面，近來也有傑出的人才。譬如張大千的山水以及齊白石的花卉等、就是例外。至以後起的靑年畫家羣中，爲我們所熟識而將來甚有前途，則有一位名林心傳的，他是具有獨特的繪畫天才的，我會見過他所作的花卉扇面，覺得他的筆調異常潑刺蒼勁，設色古樸雅潔，構圖險宕新奇，大槪新羅，淸藤，白陽以及撝叔缶廬，白石諸家的長處都給他攝取殆盡也又把這些長處能够鎔成自己的蹊徑，而成一格，所以他有他獨自的畫面。陳列在我們眼前的百餘件作品，都洋　着他的淸新磅礴的氣韻。這個展作爲一個里程碑，是非常得當的。如果照現在的情形而努力到中年，我想，成爲一個大家是不難的。至以題跋這一方面，以及印章的布置，有些件我以爲還可斟酌，以不落前人窠臼爲上，但這一層究竟還是小疵，無足重輕的罷。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　359</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「咳……紀姨？」小老虎低聲喚着耀羣，低的幾乎聽不見；害怕耀羣還未醒困，被他喚醒了似的。</p>
<p>「嗯……？耀羣嗓音有些沙啞；踵得太沉乍醒的緣故：「虎弟嗎？」緊接聽得　草沙沙拉拉一陣，耀羣已經走出　　了。</p>
<p>「嗯！」羣耀一眼見我坐在那裏，驚喜得有些證不出的樣子；「余先生……！喀，來了一會兒嗎？眞的，怎麼不言語一聲？」這末一句話是　言小老虎說的…………</p>
<p>我想誰這時見了　等，也不肯承認她就是十來天前，在北平汕州一帶活躍的那位漂亮小姐。當初她旗袍革履，自不用說，就無論便裝，急裝、或不中不西的男裝打扮，臉上雖也上些顏料，却還不離少女的嫵媚綽約姿態。這時却完全改了樣兒，就令我在路上碰見，也決不會認識。</p>
<p>她改裝的巧處，是把女性的輪廓綫條，究全消沒；然而並不像　手化裝，顯得　腫做作。這們熱的天氣，大槪也辦不到。她的眼唇口鼻，雖然不現改造痕跡，却像移動過似的；部位，大小，高低、都與原來不同。皮膚也變得粗糙枯乾。原來那一口整齊雪白的牙齒，這時張口一笑，竟好像鄕下從來沒使過牙刷似的、黃裏還鑲着黑條，又像有些破缺的地方。</p>
<p>我固然承認她化裝功夫高妙；因這不像舞台化裝，只在燈光下，遮過一時，就算成功。也不像偵探小說裏描寫的福爾摩斯，弄些假髮假養，障眼一時。她這是長期的，並且是在倭軍特工一羣裏周旋，個個都有一副化裝手段，一副透視僞裝的眼光。</p>
<p>但耀羣並不承認這種改裝有什麼巧妙。她說當初跟着師父練習的時候，要拿本身化成另外一個原有的活人，那才算眞功夫：「譬如萍子，或那位僞金司令，只要我見過了一眼，就應當化成她們一模一樣、連言語笑貌都呌人不　眞偽、那才算化裝。」</p>
<p>總而言之，眼面前這個穿着一身不三不四軍服的粗鹵少年，不能承認她就是耀羣的僞裝，只能說是另外一人。</p>
<p>「我可眞悶壞了余先生，」耀羣開口就這們吿訴我。「碰見申隊長以後、時間太短，他也說不淸楚，總隊的消息，一點兒也聽不到，簡直隔膜……我热请您先生吿訴我一點、我再把這幾天的經過報吿給您聽——總而言之，我美得有些　……　透　！」</p>
<p>滬濱閑話</p>
<h3>魏德邁的任務</h3>
<p>— 海風</p>
<p>魏德邁將軍以杜魯門總統特使名義，已於廿二日飛抵南京。魏特使來中國，除掉官方所宣布的調查中韓實際情况以外，有無其他使命，直到目前爲止，尙難加以臆測。</p>
<p>但有一點，谷方都已加以肯定的，就是魏德邁與馬帥來華任務，已逈然不同；馬帥是奉令「執行」和談，而魏使却是搜集資料，以供美國今後對華決策的參考。</p>
<p>在魏使來華以前，各方盛傳魏使携有援華計劃，內容包括軍事及經濟兩項。但馬帥對此，已正式加以否認。</p>
<p>但中國問題，已經不能再和世界問題分割。當馬帥的援歐計劃高唱入雲的時候，魏使的中韓調查團是與援歐計劃不可分的。</p>
<p>合衆社記者於廿三日在南京發出的電訊，就指出了這一點。</p>
<p>魏使此行對於中國今後的復興，不可否認是一個極大的轉捩點。合衆社記者於廿四日南京專電中，就指出：</p>
<p>「蔣主席在最近數日內之行動，對於美國將來在中國之地位，將發生極大之影響。」</p>
<p>換句話說，魏特使最近在中國之調查，對中國將來之地位，將發生極大的影蟹。</p>
<p>中國政府爲此，已搜集各有關文件，送交魏使，其中最顯著的、有如下數點：</p>
<p>（一）中蘇關係——包括北塔山，旅大等等問題。</p>
<p>（二）經濟方面——經濟改革方案，及一切建設復興計劃。</p>
<p>（三）政治方面——說明總動員的必要性以及實施憲政的計劃。（在軍事上，自有更詳盡的說明。）</p>
<p>魏使在中國停留時間爲四星期，如若分組至谷地調查，實在太短促了。</p>
<p>我們希望魏使此行能够獲得充分的情報材抖，能够切實對中國現狀，加以援助，在目前，實在是刻不容緩了。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>夫婦之間</h3>
<p>— 明森</p>
<p>一男一女結了婚，就不得不過互相合作的共同生活。即使最理想的結合，開頭也總有一些衝突——在欲望方面，態度上，和興趣上。這些衝突解決了，結婚生活才可幸福。如果繼續衝突下去而不獲解決，男的也許要去尋找別的伴侶或安慰，而女的呢，如不想離異，就要用「呶呶督責」的手段來求解決了。</p>
<p>細分析起來，造成呶呶督責的女人的根本原因不外下列四個：</p>
<p>（一）兩性關係的失調—據勞勃脫，狄金生博士在他所著的「成千的結婚：兩性調整的醫學硏究」一書中說，婚後的完全統一，是有賴於性關係的統一的，保羅，普班諾博士在「家庭之保全」一書中，還有漢寗爾登和麥古　溫在他們合著的「婚姻上有什麼錯了」中，都表示性的失調為多數夫婦不和的根本原因。</p>
<p>許多女子在結婚時沒有一點關於兩性的知識，以後也始終沒有超過她們的初度經騐，普通的女人，如不能在她的丈夫那裏得到充分的愛情和慇懃照拂，幾乎一定要變成呶呶督責的妻子的。她往往不肯承認性關係的失調爲她的不滿意的主因，却要嚕嚕囌囌地來責備他「吃相」不好啊，態度不好啊……。</p>
<p>伊賽兒可作爲一個很好的實例：她最初愛上了一個年靑的提琴家、可是他爲自己的前途着想、拒絕跟她結婚；以後她嫁給了一個年紀較大的，生意興隆的服裝製造業者。</p>
<p>她的新家庭一成立，她立刻就發生了一種「潔癖」·她從早到晚，洗擦着她屋裏的一切東西。她不許她的丈夫躺在任何一張臥榻上，除非先舖上一塊保護的布。她不斷地注視着來訪的客人，恐怕他們把香烟灰彈在地板上。這樣過了十一年，她的丈夫終於走了——一去不復返。</p>
<p>原因全在兩性關係的失調。愛賽兒的丈夫不比那個提琴家，不是一個「優牙的」男子；他的態度很粗魯。對於愛賽兒，跟她丈夫的性的經騐、是「粗俗」，「不潔」的。在那十一年的結婚期間，她不曾有過一些正當的戀愛生活——她呶呶不已地督責着，不斷地警戒着，把她的屋裏弄得非常淸潔，算是補償了那個。</p>
<p>（二）羅曼蒂克的好夢——一般電影，通俗小說，和流行歌曲，使年靑的女子對於戀愛得到了一種深刻的浪漫的觀念。據E·D·毛勒在「家庭的瓦解」Ｇ　書中說：「這種羅曼蒂克的婚姻觀，成了夫婦失和的焦點。」</p>
<p>華德·李普曼在「道德的序文」中說得好：「除了相愛以外，什麼也不做的一對愛人，其實並不値得豔美；什麼也不附有的戀愛，很快的將成爲什麼都不是。一對愛人不僅彼此相愛，且一道愛着許多的事物——這樣的愛情才會持久。撇開了生活上的其他正經事許，戀愛是　以有仔細果的。」</p>
<p>堅持着浪漫的變　　念的女人，時時在拿她的文天來跟　在小說中讀到或電影裏看到的一　想的愛人」相比較。不幸，這種樂事只能送她到求婚或結婚的一天，等到她自已的結婚美夢失去其桃色的光澤時，她就要大失所望，覺得受了欺騙，而毫不猶豫地訴之於呶呶督責了。（上）</p>
<h3>新聞剪輯</h3>
<p>收藏家的悲哀</p>
<p>江陰　山鎭民盧萬泉，業屠，抗戰時專事收集各種輔幣鈔券，積藏於米囤內，數以擔計，五花八門，蔚爲大觀。近年物價迭漲，幣値劇跌，盧因此竟憂鬱而死。據悉：其所囤輔幣，當時至少可易稻一千二百擔。</p>
<p>老太婆當保長</p>
<p>河北豐潤縣殷官屯，歷經戰禍，男子逃避一空，去年收復之初，縣府以該地保甲負責無人，乃指定該村老婦崔楊氏（六十五歲）及何南氏（六十歲）爲正副保長，辦理村內事務，任職以來，已一年有半，成績斐然。對各機關應付甚爲圓滑，徵糧徵款，尤能認眞辦理。但兩老婦均不識字，其徵糧徵款記賬之方法，據兩婦自謂：徵糧一斗，在紙上畫一「十」字，半斗畫一月牙，微款每萬元畫一小圈，從來未生錯誤。</p>
<p>如此局長</p>
<p>安徽歙縣警察局長蔡伯超，目前將該局科長朱某用繩五花大綁，綑送　縣縣府法辦，其拘捕原因係「密兼屯漢某報記者」。縣府審訊後，認爲「兼新聞記者犯罪」於法無據，不予受理，現朱某正以「妨害自由」向蔡提出上訴。</p>
<p>也是辦法</p>
<p>靑島市新運促進會，爲整飭市容並維持曰淸潔起見，規定沿街谷戶，於每晨六時至七時間，將各戶門前街道，打掃淸潔，違者處罰。又規定在路隨時吐痰者，徐處以罰金或勞役之外，並着其將所吐之痰洗刷乾凈。</p>

<h3>記紐約城</h3>
<p>— 溥倫</p>
<p>—是世界第二城市，住着七十五個國籍的人民</p>
<p>一七七六年，紐約還是一個很小的城市，居民大都是英國人和荷蘭人；但今日的紐約已成爲世界第二大的城市了。在那裏居住着七十五個不同國籍的民人，說着谷種各樣的方言。</p>
<p>紐約城開始有人住着的時候是一八四七年，人口慢慢就增加起來。到了一九〇五年達到了一百萬的人口，如今咧，已超過了七百萬人。像一個大的鍋爐一樣，這個大城市竟然變成了一個公共的「分母」，因爲它不是屬於英格兰人·荷蘭人·俄羅斯人·也不是德國人·更不是愛爾蘭人，而是包括着每一個「分子」。</p>
<p>最有趣的是居住紐約城的愛爾蘭人，居然比較居住在他們自已的京城—都比林—還多；他們在衙门裏做事的不少，而在警察界亦佔有地位。紐約的意大利人亦一隊比住在羅馬多，一共有一·〇九五·〇〇〇人，他們是在一九〇〇至一九二〇年這一時期大量湧入紐約城的，是紐約城外邦人中最多的一羣；他們多有懷鄕病，很想回返祖國。</p>
<p>紐約城的中國人有一萬二千人，實際上恐怕要比這個數目多一倍；他們是第一次世界大戰時移入的軍官，大部住在中國街。在那裏的中國女人，十個當中祗有一個可以嫁得出去；這就是說，那裏的中國男人，結婚的條件很差。他們多數在酒吧或餐館工作，而且習慣夜生活。</p>
<p>紐約的法國人祗有一萬九千人，他們沒有固定的社團，因爲是組織散淺的緣故，他們以本國人所設的酒吧做聚集的塲所。組國的貧窮和混亂，使他們奔入紐約來希望一點好運氣；他們從事於酒吧·出入口·化裝品·和流行工業等職業，許多法國人最後還希望遄返祖國。</p>
<p>紐約的俄羅斯人，有三分之二是俄羅斯革命前來的，現有五萬七千人，而多數已歸化美國了，他們很少自稱爲白俄，大部份不喜歡共產主義。他們從事建築，另有一都份是商人。</p>
<p>德國人在紐約很有組織，他們常常聯絡；每個星期全部的德國人家庭聚會在一起，穿着他們本國的服裝，講自己的話，跳祖國的舞，和喝着多量的啤酒。他們的民族意識强得很可怕。</p>
<p>紐約的捷克人和德國人有點相同，他們有着自已設立的學校，以祖國的語言教授小學生關於本國的民俗學·歷史·　歌和這個老國家的舞蹈。這是業餘的學校，目的在使小孩子忘不掉自己的祖國。他們對慶祝他們的國慶非常熱心；他們亦很忠實地熱烈地支特用他們本國文字的四家報紙。他們大部從事商業。</p>
<p>佔着紐約城總人口百分之八的四十一萬二千的波蘭人，大部份是熟練的工業工人。</p>
<p>紐約的猶太人相富多，幾乎佔該城人口三一分之一，是該城成衣業的熟練工人。這些沒有祖國的猶太人倒很團結，他們所組織許多人民團體是沒有一個國家可以比較的。這是由於他們共同的文化遺產和古代的民族習慣，使他們有着一種團體的特性。許多年老的猶太人依然虔誠地信奉正教。</p>
<p>希臘人因為會做美味的菜，所以他們在紐約的職業大半是廚子那裏的希臘人有五萬三千人。南斯拉夫人在紐約有一萬一千人，許多人信仰共產主義，他們房子裏掛着史達林和狄托的肖像。</p>
<p>紐約的匈牙利人有一二三·〇〇〇人，大部從事商業。</p>
<p>其他挪成人有五萬四千人，他們在商界很佔地位。荷蘭人有一萬一千人，他們是最初來到羅約城的。最少是印度人，祗有一百五十人。</p>
<p>以上是紐約城一些重要國家的人民一般的情形。</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>「追」—值得推荐的好戲</p>
<p>無疑地「八千里路雲和月」後，這是一部正視現實，反映現實的好戲。筆者願意向每一個愛好國產電影的觀衆推荐。</p>
<p>在這部片子裏，你可以看到苦難中國的社會縮影。抗戰是勝利了，可是那些發國難財的，發勝利財的　　暴發戶，他們更胡作非爲了。而另一方面，那些堅苦奮鬥的民族工業家，却在風雨中苦撐，工廠的命運是朝不保夕，甚至那位民族工業家方子久，己經被逼得成了癱瘓症。還是那些中起民　工業衆所遭遇的苦難命運的縮影。</p>
<p>導演　全片處理極為漲機，義之於「聖城記」，顯然更　進了一步。</p>
<p>黃家英雖然初上銀幕。但極能把握住道　善良而天眞的性格。魏鶴齡，　　，韓濤，都有着相當的成就。黃寄江樸實的演技，證明他在電影上將與舞台上同樣有着優秀的成績。</p>
<p>攝影、錄音，均在水平以上，置景較差。</p>
<p>傷感的「龍鳳花燭」</p>
<p>這是一部從鴛鴦蝴蝶派的言情小書「玉梨瑰」改編　來的，雖然有着一個反對封建反禮教的題材，但是劇中那些人物，都是缺少了「熟」與「力」，因此他們所留下來的只是一些　人眼淚的故事，傷　而　　的感情。</p>
<p>故事是被編排得够纏綿憐憫，哀　數人的，不過屠光啓的導演技術差了些、許多畫面都缺少了詩情畫意、而被弄得相得的庸俗。周炳文與方麗　婚後的幾段生活描寫，在過程的處理上也較生硬。</p>
<p>演員中。　熱　　　　相　優秀的收　·尤其後半段的　、給人很深的印象，馮喆一人分飾二角，而成績平平。比較起來，徐大平要較佳於周炳文。</p>
<p>偵探片「泣殘紅」</p>
<p>「泣殘紅」是蓓蒂，葛蘭實改變作風之作，故事是一般的美國流行小說，從一個女人的被謀殺到破案。此劇唯一可取的是編劇者的寫作技巧，尙較誘頴可喜。</p>
<p>蓓蒂葛蘭寳的琪兒，演技平穩而己。</p>
<p>無卿的「雙雄喍血」</p>
<p>一個賭塲首領，一個女學生，二個人莫明其妙的戀愛了，故事就從這裏展開，尤莫無聊的，是賭塲首領還是個專跟女人「講戀愛」的老手，可是在劇本中，却般描寫得那末神聖，這真是那位影劇老的異想天開。</p>
<p>假　不吿訴你這是名導演茂文李勞　導演的片子，你簡　不會相信，成說會如此平庸。</p>
<p>其他</p>

The Northeast Administration, in response to this reality, has consulted with the North China authorities to implement a material exchange system between Guan Nei and Guan Wai, and the specific measures are discussed as follows: (1) The Pingjin area will purchase grain in the Northeast, tentatively set at 10,000 to 20,000 tons per month, with each city allocating half. (2) The Northeast will purchase daily necessities such as flour, gauze, and kerosene, based on the negotiated price or wholesale price of the Pingjin area after the food from the Northeast arrives in Pingjin, and transport them out of Guan with trucks at the same value as the grain price. (3) For transporting rice to North China, the Northeast Vehicle Allocation Committee will form two grain transportation trains, transporting grain twice to seven times per month.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing; Issues Written Statement Clarifying Purpose of Visit to Shanghai; Invites Chinese and American Figures to Exchange Views Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, Jiangwan Airport presented a lively scene due to General Wedemeyer's arrival in Shanghai. Commander Xuan and Chairman Fang arrived around 9:00 AM and waited quietly for the distinguished guest. At 9:45 AM, Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan drove in and, seeing the people on the scene, exclaimed, "You came very early." Representatives of 36 Shanghai organizations, led by Xie Renzhao, Wang Zhuyi, and Shui Xiangyun, arrived successively. American Consul General Davis, Flying Tiger General Chennault, and American military personnel also arrived one after another. The number of welcoming personnel at the airport exceeded two hundred, forming a long line with a welcome flag inscribed in Chinese and English with "Welcome General Wedemeyer Delegation." The 701st Platoon of the U.S. Military Police stood ready for inspection by the special envoy. At exactly 10:00 AM, an airplane shadow appeared in the clear sky. At 10:05 AM, the silver giant Samsung aircraft with tail number 49149 landed. The tall and slender Special Envoy Wedemeyer, wearing a Han blue casual suit and a white pith helmet, stepped down from the aircraft door. Consul General Davis took the lead to shake hands and pay respects. Mayor Wu then shook hands to express his welcome, saying: Shanghai representatives from all walks of life originally planned to hold a grand welcome ceremony, but because they learned that the investigation was busy with official duties and time was precious, they only sent representatives to the airport to welcome them. He then introduced Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, and Director Chen Guolian to meet with the Special Envoy. Wedemeyer walked to the front of the welcoming line, shaking hands and greeting everyone one by one. There were many old friends among the special envoy, and they were very happy to meet. Hu Yunqiu, the manager of the Sino-Belgian Bank, brought his family to the airport to welcome Wedemeyer. When they met, he asked, "Is your nose better?" Wedemeyer repeatedly said, "Better, better." Ms. Wu Weici, representative of the Chinese Women's Association, and Ms. Yang Tianlin, daughter of Yang Xiaotian, presented flowers to pay their respects. Wedemeyer thanked them repeatedly. At 10:15 AM, Special Envoy Wedemeyer and the investigation personnel drove to their private residence to rest.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>After arriving, Wedemeyer issued a written statement, stating the purpose of his visit to Shanghai and his impressions of China. The content is as follows: "As I pointed out in my first press release after arriving in Beijing on Tuesday, during this short trip, members of our delegation will visit various places as much as possible and obtain authoritative materials from a variety of different sources. Over the past four days, we have sought factual information and gained a lot. We have obtained statistical data from various government departments, as well as materials from the education, industry, commerce, and other professional sectors. We hope to obtain a cross-section of the political, economic, and psychological state. Therefore, the initial visit to Shanghai will provide a good opportunity to supplement the financial and economic materials we have already obtained. We have received many suggestions of different natures from many authoritative sources. Those who made these suggestions are all people of your country who hope to establish a stable political and economic system. Therefore, what we said in our first speech, that we are most concerned about learning about the measures taken by China in the hope of revival and how effective they are, has aroused the sympathy and resonance of countless patriotic and selfless people of your country. At the same time, I have obtained affirmative expressions from these sources: that in order to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of China's politics and the smooth restoration of economic stability, many constructive steps should be taken. What our delegation is now concerned about is what constructive steps have been taken."</p>

In addition, the Beijing Municipal Council's plan to host Wedemeyer has been replied to. Wedemeyer expressed his gratitude for the kind invitation, citing the limited time and busy work schedule in China. The Municipal Council has decided to cancel the proposed reception.</p>
<h3>Developing Sino-American Trade; Chamber of Commerce to Submit Written Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to Ge Jiecun, a standing director of the Chamber of Commerce, who told reporters: General Wedemeyer originally planned to talk with representatives of China's industrial and commercial circles during his visit to Shanghai, but this has been cancelled due to the excessive time. Shou Jingwei, secretary-general of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, said: Marshal Marshall's visit to China in the past focused on the political aspects, while Wedemeyer's visit this time has also involved the economic sector. The Federation of Chambers of Commerce will submit written opinions within a few days for General Wedemeyer's reference, focusing on developing Sino-American trade. Industrial and commercial circles originally planned to publicly host Wedemeyer, but this has been cancelled. However, before Wedemeyer came to Shanghai, the American side hoped that China's industry and commerce would prepare materials, so it is not impossible for some industrial and commercial leaders, such as Xu Jizhen, Li Fuxun, and Han Huiqing, to visit Wedemeyer in their private capacity for a few minutes of conversation. Zhang Yujiu believes that Wedemeyer's trip to Shanghai is too hasty to meet with representatives of China's industrial and commercial circles, but he may leave economic advisors in Shanghai when he goes to Beijing tomorrow to contact China's industrial and commercial circles and conduct investigations.</p>

<h3>U.S. Policy Toward China Association Issues Open Letter to Special Envoy Wedemeyer, Urging the U.S. to Honor Promises and Provide Economic and Military Assistance to China, and for the Soviets to Compensate for Losses in Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] The U.S. Policy Toward China Association (the late Powell, publisher of the China Weekly Review, once served as its president) has recently issued an open letter to General Wedemeyer, Special Representative of the President, urging the U.S. to honor its promise of "providing only economic assistance and military supplies to the National Government of China." The letter, dated July 17, was forwarded to Wedemeyer through the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing. The salient points are excerpted below:</p>
<p>When President Roosevelt approved Secretary of State Hull's note to Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura Kichisaburo, on November 26, 1941, he finally adopted a firm stance to fully realize the Open Door Policy announced by former Secretary of State John Hay in 1899 and included in the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 by former Secretary of State Hughes. In his note to Nomura, Secretary of State Hull insisted that the U.S. and Japan should agree to cooperate only with the National Government of China in "political, economic, and military affairs." However, in the Yalta Secret Agreement, President Roosevelt granted certain privileges in Northeast China to the Soviet Union, thereby agreeing to undermine the Open Door Policy. Both sides also made a clear understanding that the Soviet Union would only recognize the National Government of China. The following August, the above understanding was formally documented in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and the Soviet Union agreed to provide only economic assistance and military supplies to the National Government of China. Since then, the Soviet Union has deliberately violated almost every point of the treaty, providing only assistance and military supplies to the Chinese Communist Party. We have also violated the Yalta Agreement, as we have provided assistance to both the Chinese Communists and the National Government. We believe that at present, we should respect the Open Door Policy of 1922 and the rumors about China's independence and territorial integrity. Therefore, we must continue to give our fullest support to the National Government of China, as we did in times of crisis, "because this crisis gave rise to the Pearl Harbor incident." We should also respect President Roosevelt's sacred promise made at the Cairo Conference to "return the Northeast to the Republic of China." Now is the time for the Soviet Union to abide by its sacred agreement and for the National Government of China to recognize various principles and obligations, and for the United States to make a decisive contribution to the war in the Pacific. Since the Victory over Japan Day, our government has refused the National Government of China to purchase military arms or ammunition and requested the United Kingdom to take the same attitude, but today is the time to provide China with assistance so that it can defeat the Communist rebellion instigated, directed, and armed by the Soviet Union. The National Government of China is fighting for us today, just as the United Kingdom did in 1940 to 1941. We should establish a policy that respects all our words and international agreements, restores our credibility in the eyes of one billion people in Asia, and avoids a more terrifying Second Pearl Harbor incident.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Japanese Peace Treaty and the Future of the Nation, the Government Should Declare its Position Early; Supervisory Committee Members Propose Five Recommendations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] As the United States invited the eleven member countries of the Far Eastern Commission to hold preliminary discussions on the Japanese peace treaty, members of the Supervisory Yuan, Liu Shidu, Yang Zongpei, Cai Zisheng, Wang Guanwu, and Liu Yantao, proposed five recommendations, advocating that the government make a clear statement on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. The recommendations, approved by Yu Youren, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan. Before presenting the recommendations, Liu and others first stated: "Our country's war of resistance against Japan, after eight years of bloody battles, has achieved victory, but a peace treaty has not yet been signed. Recently, it has been heard that the United States has invited the member countries of the Far Eastern Commission to preliminarily discuss the issue of the Japanese peace treaty on August 19. The Japanese peace treaty is not only the conclusion of settling the blood debts of the war of resistance but also the prelude to opening up the future of the nation. Our government should have declared a clear position and attitude on this major issue so that the participating countries can understand it and respect the opinions of our country, which led the war of resistance against Japan. However, to this day, the government has not made any expression on this matter, nor has it ever expressed any views on the occupation of Japan. It has not submitted any documents in the Far Eastern Commission, which foreign critics find strange. As of today, it is impossible to remain silent."</p>
<p>The five recommendations of Liu and others are: (1) Although our country embraces forgiveness toward Japan and does not dwell on past grievances, the peace treaty should strictly stipulate in all aspects to guarantee that there is no danger of being invaded again, such as never allowing the establishment of an army, destroying military industries, and re-educating the Japanese people. (2) MacArthur's advocacy that Japan retain the industrial standards above 1930 to 1934 should be opposed by our country. According to the Cairo Declaration, Japan should be reduced to an agricultural country. Our country must insist that Japan's industry cannot exceed China's industrial level, so as to prevent economic aggression from happening again. All equipment of Japan's industry that exceeds the current level of China's industry should be dismantled and used to compensate for all public and private losses during the war of resistance. The materials to be compensated to our country should also include sufficient ships for transportation. (3) The value of the materials absorbed by Japan and its puppet government in China by issuing counterfeit currency should be fully compensated by Japan. It is reported that the gold and treasures in the Bank of Japan are worth about 200 million U.S. dollars, and the Japanese government secretly holds diamonds, gold, and cloth worth 75 billion yuan, which should be used as compensation. Our country should demand at least half of it to reorganize our monetary system. (4) Our country and Japan must open up trade with each other only on an equal industrial level, otherwise, our country's industry will inevitably suffer oppression. (5) After the peace treaty is signed, our country should continue to participate in military occupation and political supervision for a considerable period so that Japan can be thoroughly democratized, and there will be no more monopolistic capitalists or militaristic warlords, and there will be no danger of aggression again. The conclusion states that the above points are the minimum conditions for opening up the future of our country and meeting security requirements, and we should make a clear statement based on the position of a victorious country.</p>
<h3>The Motion to Postpone Opening Trade with Japan is Passed by the Standing Committee of the Senate, and the Decided Measures are Submitted to the Government for Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Standing Committee of the Senate held a plenary review meeting on the issue of temporarily postponing the opening of trade with Japan on the 26th. Representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Economy, and Finance were invited to attend and report. The meeting was chaired by Cao Dehui. After the report, the chairman presented the two proposals on trade with Japan that had not been concluded in the Standing Committee meeting on the 25th for discussion. One was proposed by Zheng Kuiyi and others, "Requesting the government to temporarily postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty with Japan," and the other was proposed by Xue Mingjian, "Proposed to request the government to temporarily postpone the opening of trade with Japan." After heated debate among the senators, a conclusion was reached at 12 o'clock as follows: "The two proposals are merged for discussion, with two measures: (1) Request the government to temporarily postpone the opening of private trade with Japan before the peace treaty is signed; (2) In order to seek temporary exchange of goods with Japan, the past barter trade methods with Japan can be improved or expanded. Submit it to the government for handling." The meeting on the 26th was a plenary review meeting. However, as decided by the plenary meeting of the Standing Committee on the 25th, the conclusion made by the plenary review meeting is the conclusion of the Standing Committee, so it will be submitted to the government for handling according to the decision of the review meeting.</p>
<p>Reports from Representatives of the Three Ministries</p>
<p>At today's meeting, Huang Zheng, a representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported that after learning that MacArthur's headquarters had decided to open Japan's foreign trade, and after our delegation to Japan reported that various countries would send business inspection groups to Japan, the ministry invited relevant agencies to study the methods. It was then decided to send a business inspection group to Japan to study the actual situation of industry and commerce in Japan. At the same time, he telegraphed our ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, about three things: (1) Does the decision on whether trade with Japan requires the control of Japanese institutions need to be passed by the Far Eastern Commission? (2) Has it been passed by the Far Eastern Commission? (3) Has our representative expressed any views? Ambassador Gu replied that the Far Eastern Commission is discussing this issue. Therefore, what we are considering is whether we can prevent it from opening if we object? If we take an opposing attitude and do not open up, and other countries can still trade with it, it will also be a loss for us diplomatically. Zhu, a representative from the Ministry of Finance, reported that the issue of opening up trade with Japan is related to the Ministry of Finance in two points: (1) Trade with Japan requires payment in U.S. dollars, but our U.S. dollar reserves are too small. Some people believe that we can exchange sugar and salt for U.S. dollars, so there will be no difficulty. However, according to the investigation, our past trade with Japan has always had a large deficit, so this point is worth noting. (2) The Allied Headquarters stipulates that the price of goods is based on the world market price to support Japanese exporters, which will be a major blow to our commerce in the future. Yang Shuren, a representative from the Ministry of Economy, also continued to give a brief report on the receipt of the notice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the preparations for the business inspection group to Japan. Senators Xue Mingjian, Wu Zhaoxu, Gan Jiaxin, and Zheng Kuiyi raised questions one after another after the reports from the various ministries, and the representatives answered them on the spot before leaving.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Senators</p>
<p>Then, the senators once again raised their opinions on "temporary postponement." Almost all of the proposers and speakers opposed the opening, but because international diplomacy had to be taken into account, there was room for consideration. Therefore, none of the speakers advocated opening. Wu Zhaoxu said: "I believe that the issue of opening up trade with Japan is not a policy decision, but a technical discussion. We transport raw materials out and import consumer goods. And since we have sent a business inspection group to Japan, we naturally cannot prevent Japanese business groups from coming to our country. Following this, the Japanese can go to our Northeast and our Taiwan. In the future, disputes will continue to occur, and the Wanbaoshan Incident may be repeated. Can we not take this as a warning?" Gan Jiaxin believes that after opening trade with Japan, whether there will be any impact on Sino-Japanese relations politically should be considered. At the same time, we can focus on discussing the following points: (1) Please notify the government that the Allied Headquarters should adopt strict control policies on trade with Japan and should not support the remnants of Japanese imperialism; (2) The unreasonable measures in the policy of opening up Japan's foreign trade should be corrected by the Allied Headquarters. For example, after our country promulgated the import and export subsidy measures, the United States immediately announced countermeasures to offset our country's export promotion measures. Should similar events also occur in trade with Japan? Attention should be paid to this; (3) The government should make plans for the current financial and international trade situation for the opening of trade with Japan; (4) Before these preparations are completed, temporarily postpone the opening of trade. Later, several senators raised their opinions, believing that if Japanese goods flood the market in the future, and various market items compete to dump, our country's industrial and commercial economy will inevitably suffer a severe blow. If there is another war in the future, it will not be possible to see it today.</p>
<p>Decision to Merge the Two Proposals</p>
<p>Also, the representative of the Ministry of Finance stated that before the peace treaty with Japan is signed, it is not subject to the restrictions of the International Trade Conference, and tariffs can be freely determined, increased, or changed. Therefore, our country's tariffs on Japan may have a special tariff, that is, (1) those that help our industrial production need not be increased, such as bleaching powder, sulfur, and other chemical raw materials; (2) luxury goods and those that compete with us can be increased. However, Xue Mingjian reiterated that Japan has announced a plan to trade with our country for a surplus of 500,000 U.S. dollars this year to continue its economic aggression. This point alone is enough to alert us, and if our people commit smuggling and other acts, our surplus may reach 10 million U.S. dollars, which is unimaginable. After much discussion, it was finally decided to merge the two proposals. The second measure in the original first proposal, which was to convene representatives of people's organizations and industrial and commercial experts to formulate a trade plan to strive for the initiative in trade with Japan, was considered difficult to implement and was reserved.</p>
<h3>Wan Can Recommends Again, Emphasizing Four Points</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The "Re-recommendation" proposed by Supervisory Committee member Wan Can and others regarding the opposition to the opening of trade with Japan has been drafted and is being submitted to the President of the Yuan for review, and it will be formally submitted soon. In addition to restating the various opinions in the original recommendation, the re-recommendation specifically emphasizes the following four points: (1) Our country has not yet restored normal relations with Japan; (2) According to the plan proposed by Japan, our deficit will exceed 50 million U.S. dollars, which is obviously unfavorable to us; (3) Our wounds have not yet recovered, and it is not appropriate to resume trade with Japan in terms of law and reason; (4) If we resume trade with Japan at this time, it will not be easy to speak at the peace conference in the future.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Will Host the Japanese Peace Conference Regardless of the Soviet Union's Refusal, and All Countries Except the Soviet Union Agree to the U.S. Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] Newsweek recently reported that the U.S. government will proceed with hosting the Japanese peace conference regardless of the Soviet Union's refusal to participate. The magazine also pointed out that the U.S. will make the following recommendations at the conference: The U.S. delegation will be ordered to promote a non-retaliatory peace, so that a demilitarized Japan can achieve economic survival and become a stabilizing factor in the Far East. The Japanese government will have every opportunity to express its views on the various peace treaty terms to the Allied Headquarters, which will forward them to the conference. The U.S. will propose that the treaty not include clauses for paying reparations, and the U.S. is prepared to waive its own reparations claims and will urge other countries to waive their claims as well.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] The U.S. State Department announced today that all eleven member countries of the Far Eastern Commission except the Soviet Union have agreed to hold a preliminary Japanese peace conference according to the guidelines proposed by the United States. Except for China and France, the United States has received formal replies from all other countries. China and France have also informally expressed their agreement, and China also advocated that the Japanese peace conference should be held in Shanghai rather than Washington or San Francisco as proposed by the United States.</p>

<h3>Luo Jialun Gives a Speech in India Titled "Freedom from Fear"</h3>

Among the distinguished guests were Miss Charlie Mountbatten and members of the diplomatic corps in Delhi. Ambassador Luo gave a speech entitled "Freedom from Fear." As Mr. Luo arrived, the orchestra played our national anthem, and all the guests stood at attention. The garden where the evening was held was decorated with our national flag. In his speech, Mr. Luo mentioned the war of ideas, saying: "Whether deception has no malicious intent or may even be motivated by altruism, deception seems to be the cause of hatred, and there is no doubt that this kind of hatred will inevitably cause a strong reaction. Thought is not as good as deceiving others. I firmly believe that the freedom of the nation is closely linked, but it is by no means in the form of a Nazi concentration camp." Mr. Luo also said: "I hope that other countries will no longer provide weapons or armed assistance to the parties of neighboring countries to continue the open rebellion against their legitimate governments and to fight against their motherland, which they did not have to split from." According to Mr. Luo's opinion: "Whenever and wherever there is interference or restraint, there is no freedom." Mr. Luo also asked: "What happiness is there in life if you live in self-made fear?"</p>
<h3>The Fushun Massacre That Shocked the Country Fifteen Years Ago is Investigated on the Ground</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th] Yamashita Mitsunan, Kinuyama Yumikan, and other major criminals in the Fushun Pingdingshan case that shocked the country fifteen years ago have been arrested one after another. The Northeast Headquarters Military Tribunal recently sent personnel to investigate the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders on the ground and will exhume the remains of the victims and collect evidence of the crimes. Pingdingshan is a small village six kilometers northeast of Fushun, where Huangri Fushun miners lived. On September 15, 1932, anti-Japanese martyr Deng Diaohang led the Volunteer Army to attack Fushun at night, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The next day, the Japanese army searched extensively and captured a volunteer soldier living in Pingdingshan. They then falsely accused the village of communicating with the Volunteer Army, falsely claimed to take pictures of the residents of the village, and coerced them to an open space outside the village, where they were strafed with machine guns. More than 2,700 innocent people, women, and children were killed.</p>

<h3>Editorial: How Can We Allow the Netherlands to Act Unilaterally?</h3>
<p>Since the Netherlands used force against the Republic of Indonesia on the 21st, we are not only worried about the fate of our millions of overseas Chinese, fearing that they will be affected as innocent bystanders, but also concerned about peace in Southeast Asia. According to reports from Agence France-Presse, the Chinese district of Medan in northern Sumatra has been burned down since the Netherlands launched a large-scale offensive against Indonesia; and the Chinese district in Sambas has also been looted by the military. The news has further deepened our concern for the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese. At the same time, according to reports from the United Press, the Netherlands has refused China's offer to mediate, arguing that the Dutch-Indonesian conflict is a matter of internal affairs and does not allow other countries to intervene. If this news is true, then we cannot help but express our deep regret for the unilateral actions of the Dutch authorities in Indonesia!</p>
<p>First, China is not only directly affected by the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, causing our millions of overseas Chinese to suffer the misfortune of being affected as innocent bystanders, but also indirectly affected, which is enough to disrupt peace in Asia. Therefore, under any circumstances, no matter how sufficient the reasons for the Netherlands to use force against Indonesia, China cannot stand idly by. Moreover, China has no intention of siding with any party in the Indonesian issue, only hoping that both parties can adopt diplomatic negotiations to reach a peaceful resolution so that both parties can live in peace. We expressed great satisfaction when the Linggadjati Agreement was signed. Subsequently, the talks fell into a stalemate due to the unresolved issue of mixed constabulary. Our government expressed great concern and instructed Jiang Jiadong, the consul general stationed in Batavia, to exert efforts to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute to avoid another outbreak of war. However, the conflict still inevitably occurred. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs again instructed Consul General Jiang to continue to work hard on the ground, preferably to mediate and turn hostility into friendship, in order to safeguard the safety of millions of overseas Chinese and peace in Asia. This goodwill and painstaking effort has not only failed to be understood by the Dutch government, but it has even rejected our mediation. This unilateral behavior of the Netherlands will inevitably arouse the anger of the Chinese people; at the same time, our concern for Indonesia will inevitably increase. We will never stand idly by because of the Netherlands' refusal. On the contrary, we will continue to work hard. China, as the only permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in Asia, can bring the Dutch-Indonesian conflict to the United Nations on behalf of Indonesia, promoting international common intervention.</p>
<p>Second, the Netherlands must pay attention to international public opinion. Not only do Britain and the United States consider the Netherlands' use of force in Indonesia unwise, but all Asian countries express indignation at the Dutch army's arrival in Asia to massacre the Indonesian people. Nehru of the Indian National Congress has long publicly pointed out that the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia is a great insult to Asia, and expressed that India will assist Indonesia in fighting to the end by all possible means. Many Australian university students also demonstrated in front of the Dutch consulate the day before yesterday, protesting the Netherlands' use of force in Indonesia. As for the Chinese people, they unanimously believe that the Netherlands' adoption of high-pressure policies or threats of force against Indonesia is a way for the Netherlands to cut itself off from India. How can the Dutch authorities turn a deaf ear to the roars of the people of various Asian countries? The British Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, also believes that the Dutch-Indonesian conflict is a great loss to the world economy, which will not only exhaust Indonesia's resources but also make future cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia more difficult. The Dutch authorities should pay special attention to and consider these valuable comments.</p>
<p>Third, although the current policy adopted by the Dutch government in Indonesia has been approved by the Dutch parliament, and the Communist Party's proposal to immediately cease war actions has been rejected by the parliament, the Dutch political situation is still in a state of flux. Not only does the Communist Party resolutely oppose the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia, but all enlightened people believe that the Netherlands' adoption of an imperialist approach to treating colonies will inevitably lead to failure sooner or later. Standing in a third-party position, we can say impartially that the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia may achieve smooth progress in the initial stage of the war; but future facts will certainly prove that Indonesia is like a "quagmire," trapping the Netherlands in the quagmire and making it unable to save itself.</p>
<p>In short, as we look around at the current international situation and look at the Dutch domestic political situation, the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia is absolutely an unwise move. There are also many wise people in the Dutch Socialist Party. How can they lead the Netherlands on a path of suicide without realizing it? It should be known that all countries in the world, whether it is Britain, the United States, or Asian countries, will not allow the Netherlands to act unilaterally in Indonesia.</p>
<h3>A Major Test for the Citizens of Shanghai</h3>
<p>People's organizations from all walks of life in Shanghai held a Great Meeting for Suppressing Communists and Building the Nation and Comforting the Troops on the 20th of this month. At the meeting, a decision was made to launch a 10,000-yuan troop-comforting campaign, and it was scheduled to start fundraising today. The preparatory committee held a meeting the day before yesterday and also decided on several specific measures that are not only practical but also take into account the hardships of the people. The total amount of donations is expected to be 10 billion yuan. This amount is not small, but as long as the fundraising is done properly and those with money donate enthusiastically, the so-called "many a little makes a mickle," it will not be difficult to achieve the goal of 10 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The biggest feature of this 10,000-yuan troop-comforting fundraising method is that it is completely based on the people's autonomy and willingness, and does not have any compulsory nature, let alone adopt an apportionment method. From our point of view, there are two profound meanings for the preparatory committee to adopt this method.</p>
<p>First, the role of comforting the troops is not about the people donating 10,000 or 100,000 yuan, but about the people truly understanding the meaning of suppressing Communists and building the nation. To be honest, the reason why China's politics and economy have been brought to this point, and the reason why the livelihood of the people across the country is so painful, is entirely due to the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits are the source of all chaos in the country. They attempt to destroy the bright future of the country and seize power in a situation where the country is in chaos and the people are living in misery. If it were not for our loyal and brave soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines, even the people in Shanghai would not be able to live a normal life like they do now. Regarding this point, the United States' fact-finding mission that came to China with General Wedemeyer saw that the root cause of China's political and economic ills was the threat of the Communist Party, which prevented the government from implementing large-scale social and economic reforms. Therefore, the only way out for China in the future is to strive to quell the rebellion like a "brave man cutting off his wrist." The people in the rear must not ignore the importance of suppressing the Communists. If the Communists are not suppressed, the nation cannot be built. Mayor Wu said in his speech at the troop-comforting meeting, "Suppressing the Communists is as important as resisting Japan." These words are most worthy of deep thought by all the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Second, Shanghai is China's only treaty port, and it is also the center of China's industry and commerce. There must be many wealthy families who, based on the principle of "those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money," should donate more money to make a strong expression to the soldiers who are on the front lines risking their lives to suppress the rebellion for the people. However, on the other hand, there are also many poor citizens in Shanghai who cannot get enough food or clothing. Although they also understand the current national affairs, and even their patriotism is no less than anyone else's, they are constrained by their economy and cannot contribute money to the troop-comforting campaign. We should take into account the hardships of the people and let them act naturally. We must not force them to donate money.</p>
<p>In short, Shanghai is the best area in the country, both economically, politically, and culturally. Whether this troop-comforting campaign can achieve the goal of 10 billion yuan is a major test for the citizens of Shanghai!</p>

<h3>Dutch Government Directly Refuses China, Britain, and the United States to Participate in Mediation; Gromyko Expresses No Intention to Interfere; Dutch Offensive Stalls, Yogyakarta Front Temporarily Stabilizes</h3>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Although Indonesia has appealed to the United Nations to intervene in the Dutch-Indonesian war, no party has yet submitted this issue to the Security Council. Neither the Arab countries nor Australia have taken action. The most noteworthy is the Soviet Union's attitude. According to Gromyko, the Soviet Union has not considered submitting a complaint to the Security Council on behalf of Indonesia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] According to sources, the Dutch government has notified the Chinese government that it does not want a third party to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian conflict. The Dutch government has also delivered similar notes to Britain and the United States, arguing that the Indonesian conflict is a purely internal affair. The notes state that the actions in Java are "police actions," and express gratitude to the Chinese government for its concern. They also imply that this dispute is not a matter for any foreign country. The purpose of the Dutch note to the Chinese government is to reassure China's expression of concern about the Indonesian war and to instruct the Consul General in Batavia, Jiang Dong, to "do his best to mediate to prevent the situation from worsening." Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot immediately elaborate, it is believed that the note will prevent the Chinese government from making further attempts at mediation. According to qualified observers here, due to the Dutch government's direct refusal of the intervention of China, Britain, and the United States, any similar steps thereafter must be taken by the United Nations. They believe that if the United Nations intervenes in the Indonesian dispute, the Dutch government will likely take the same position, that this matter is purely an internal affair and not within the scope of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The Dutch Embassy in Paris recently issued a statement, expressing gratitude for Britain's obvious intention to mediate the Indonesian conflict, but stating that it must depend on how the situation develops before deciding whether it is appropriate to appeal to friendly countries again.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 25th] When interviewed by a reporter from the Central News Agency, An Du, Chairman of the American Indonesian Association, commented on the news report that the Chinese government would formally propose mediating the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, saying, "The Republic of Indonesia will welcome this move," and that before action is taken by the United Nations, any mediation method proposed by any country related to the Asian colonial issue is acceptable to the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Melbourne, 25th] Opposition leader Menzies said that the Australian government's permission for the Waterside Workers' Federation to boycott Dutch ships is tantamount to tacit support for Indonesia. Although there are those in Java who seek genuine independence, there are also those who have colluded with the Japanese. The Netherlands is Australia's ally, and in the current conflict, Australia should at least maintain a neutral attitude.</p>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: According to a Dutch communique, the Dutch army is now doing whatever it pleases and is invincible. The Indonesian army along 150 miles of the northwest coast of Java has been cleared. Although the Indonesian side claims to have launched successful counterattacks in Java and Sumatra, this has been denied by the Dutch.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 26th] The Indonesian army's resistance has gradually increased, so the Dutch army's advance towards the Republic's capital, Yogyakarta, has gradually slowed down. The two Dutch prongs advancing towards Yogyakarta from Cirebon have also stopped advancing. In the last 24 hours, the Dutch army has only made progress in western Java. The Dutch army is currently attempting to regroup mechanized units in Cirebon and continue to advance along the coast towards Cirebon, with the aim of completely isolating western Java. The Indonesian army is currently obviously avoiding frontal warfare. Dutch communiques indicate that they are working to defend their supply lines and avoid being sabotaged by the Indonesian army. The Dutch army's progress in Sumatra has also been slow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 26th] Yogyakarta Radio broadcast today that although the Dutch army announced that casualties on all sides "have not reached three digits" so far, the total number of Dutch casualties has reached 9,000.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 25th] According to Indonesian sources, a half-battalion of foreign volunteers has joined the Indonesian army and is preparing to go to the front to fight.</p>

<h3>Security Council Continues to Discuss Balkan Issue; Eastern Bloc Countries Attempt to Delay</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 25th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a conflict arose again between the US and Soviet representatives over whether the Security Council has the power to establish a permanent Balkan investigation team.

The meeting then adjourned and will reconvene next Monday. The US proposal is expected to be voted on in the middle of next week.</p>

<h3>Striving for Quotas for National Assembly Representatives and Legislators - National Federation of Vocational Groups - Resolves Six Measures - Cables Request for Swift Reconsideration and Correction</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Federation of Vocational Groups held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Federation, presided over the meeting and reported that the Legislative Yuan had repeatedly and arbitrarily reduced the quotas for National Assembly representatives and legislators from vocational groups, even disregarding the decisions of the State Council. The Chamber of Commerce Federation had held multiple meetings and strongly argued against this, and had also issued a declaration of protest at a joint meeting of supervisors. It is willing to unite with all vocational groups to act together until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Rule of Law - Must Be Fought For</p>
<p>Subsequently, representatives expressed their opinions. Xu Junwu of the Nanjing Journalists Association reported on the Legislative Yuan's reduction of the quotas for legislators from vocational groups and said that the capital was sympathetic to the vocational groups' request for reconsideration. The Ministry of Social Affairs also believed that the calculations were incorrect. Wu Yun Chu, Chairman of the Industrial Association, stated the circumstances of the industrial sector's petition in Beijing. Luo Qinghua pointed out that the Legislative Yuan's violation of the State Council's decision and arbitrary reduction was an illegal act. To maintain the spirit of the rule of law, the quotas for legislators and national assembly representatives from vocational groups must be fought for.</p>
<p>Fair Competition - Should Not Be Biased</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Danping said: Being elected as a legislator and national assembly representative is purely a national duty and not a right. Competition is a virtue. The Legislative Yuan should not be biased. If it is said to be modeled after Europe and the United States, focusing on district elections, the low level of education of the people in our country makes it difficult to achieve democratic results and does not conform to national conditions. Xu Xueyu stated that the Shipping Federation would be in the same step with various vocational groups. Mao Xiaosen of the insurance industry proposed the slogan "No representatives, no taxes." Xu (blank) Chu, Zhu Huiqing, and others also spoke successively.</p>
<p>Finally, Six Measures Were Resolved</p>
<p>Finally, six measures were resolved: (1) Cable Chairman Chiang of the National Government and the State Council, requesting that the Legislative Yuan's illegal and arbitrary decision be swiftly reconsidered and corrected in the shortest possible time, and cable relevant agencies to unanimously support this. (2) Cable vocational groups in various provinces and cities and overseas Chinese vocational groups to act together. (3) Organize a special committee to preside over and promote the vocational participation movement. (4) For legislators who violate public opinion and obstruct the vocational participation movement, this federation should publicly rebuke them. (5) Cable the Ministry of Social Affairs to temporarily suspend vocational elections until this issue is legally resolved. (6) If necessary, this federation will notify various national vocational groups to convene a temporary joint meeting of representatives to jointly seek a practical and reasonable solution. In addition, a telegram was sent to various vocational groups across the country and various ministries and commissions of the National Government.</p>
<h3>If Volunteer Soldiers Cannot Be Recruited Sufficiently - Conscripting Draftees According to Law - Limited to Those Who Are 21 Years Old</h3>
<p>The procedures for applying for deferment and exemption from military service for draftees in this city have been launched in various districts and neighborhoods. Draftees are enthusiastically going to various districts and neighborhoods to apply. The Military Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Department has also extended office hours. Yesterday, the Propaganda Committee of the Military Service Association convened its first meeting. In the afternoon, Mayor Wu also summoned Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Chen Tianqiao, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, for talks. According to Zhang's statement after attending the mayor's meeting, "This city's conscription will first recruit 3,000 volunteer soldiers. It is estimated that this time, the number of volunteer soldiers can be recruited sufficiently. If 3,000 cannot be recruited, draftees will be conscripted according to law, limited to those who are 21 years old (born in 1927)." Zhang also said, "Many citizens in this city are still unclear about the laws on deferment, call-up, and exemption from military service, so there is anxiety. I would like to specifically state a few important points regarding deferment, call-up, and exemption from military service."</p>
<h3>Summary Explanation</h3>
<p>As follows: (1) Those who are studying in high school and have not graduated can apply for deferment according to law. Those who have graduated from high school and the reason for deferment no longer exists cannot apply, but those who are admitted to university and obtain a certificate of study can apply for deferment at any time (not subject to time restrictions). (2) Current employees engaged in national defense technology who have obtained a technical employee registration certificate from the Labor Bureau of the Ministry of Social Affairs can apply for deferred call-up, but those who have not registered must first have their affiliated agency or factory prepare a register and provide proof before processing the application. (3) Those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their family and have no siblings, or whose father is over 58 years old, will be deferred from call-up, but those who have siblings who are under 18 years old can also be deferred from call-up. However, the neighborhood and district chiefs will use the original household registration booklet as a basis for proof. If the draftee himself is serving in Shanghai, he must have proof from the neighborhood chief of his original county (city), township, or town. Before this proof is obtained, the service agency, factory, or store will provide proof temporarily, pending the arrival of the proof from the original residence, and then the formalities will be processed. (4) Those with physical deformities, disabilities, or chronic illnesses will be exempted from military service with proof from the neighborhood chief. (5) The application period was originally scheduled to end on the 29th of this month, but fearing that some draftees may be away in other places and unable to arrive to complete the application procedures before the 29th, they will also be allowed to complete the application procedures before August 5th during the review of deferment, call-up, and exemption from military service applications at the neighborhood office. The neighborhood chief shall not refuse. Zhang also said that the amendment to the regulations on punishing those who evade military service and those who obstruct military service by military service personnel or other personnel</p>
<h3>Neighborhood Chiefs Engage in Corruption - Citizens Can Secretly Report</h3>
<p>The first conscription work in this city will begin in early August. On the eve of this conscription, it is reported that some unscrupulous neighborhood chiefs are using their authority to engage in corruption. The authorities in charge of military service were extremely angry after hearing about this. Yesterday, they specifically stated to reporters: If citizens learn of any corrupt practices, they can secretly report them to the Shanghai Garrison District and the Municipal Garrison District, and the Municipal Government. Once verified, they will be severely punished. According to the Shanghai Garrison District, the age for volunteer conscription was originally set from 21 to 25 years old, but now, in order to encourage enlistment, it has been relaxed to 30 years old.</p>
<h3>Punishment Regulations</h3>
<p>There are detailed and explicit provisions in each article. I hope citizens will pay attention to them. As for the punishment of personnel handling military service, there are also detailed provisions in the regulations, such as those who deliberately release or conceal draftees, evade military service, and make false certifications for exemption from service, prohibition from service, removal from service, deferment from conscription, and deferment from call-up, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years but not more than five years. Those who obtain property from conscripts or their relatives by fraudulent means, demand, promise, or accept bribes for official actions, or obtain improper benefits shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years but not more than ten years and have all their bribes confiscated. Those who force men who should not be conscripted to serve in the military or commit acts of humiliation against men who have been conscripted into active service shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years but not more than seven years. If such acts result in death, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment; if such acts result in serious injury, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than ten years. Therefore, as long as citizens in this city understand the laws and follow the legal procedures, there is no need for anxiety.</p>

<h3>Enriching the Spiritual Food of Armed Comrades - Discussing Promotion of Cultural Services to the Military - Nine Measures Resolved to Collect Books and Pictorials</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party and the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee, considering that the front-line combat troops are extremely lacking in spiritual food, decided to hold a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. at the New Life Club to discuss the promotion of the cultural services to the military movement. Dozens of celebrities from the cultural, publishing, film, theater, and broadcasting industries were invited, as well as Shi Yongling, a specialist from the News Department of the Xinjiang Garrison Headquarters who recently came to Shanghai, and Yu Jizhong, Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Headquarters, who reported on the actual situation in the Northeast and Northwest regions, respectively.</p>
<p>Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Committee presided over the meeting and stated in his speech: The suffering of the material life of the front-line combat troops is self-evident, and even worse is the panic of spiritual food. Due to transportation difficulties, soldiers regard seeing pictorials and magazines as if they had obtained a treasure. Shanghai is the central area of culture, with numerous writers, and should take on the responsibility of providing assistance so that their inhuman lives can receive spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Specialist Shi and Director Yu gave speeches separately. In addition to reporting on the local situation, they unanimously believed that the destructive power of the external cultural invasion forces in the border areas was more violent than the atomic bomb. Therefore, the significance of the cultural services to the military movement is extremely important. Shanghai is the cultural center, and it is firmly believed that the cultural services to the military movement will have satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Pan Gongzhan, who is also the Director of the Cultural Committee, stated in his speech: All citizens of Shanghai should appreciate the hardships of the soldiers fighting to the death with the communists on the front lines. "Spirit is more important than material," was what the leader used to encourage the people from beginning to end during the War of Resistance. He firmly believed that the effect of 100,000 books would be better than a 10,000 yuan military comfort movement. He hoped that people in the cultural field would rise up together, show their strength, and prove with facts that Shanghai is not a dead city!</p>
<p>Later, Tao Baichuan, Liu Shi, Ji (blank), Xie Renzhao, and others spoke successively. The following cultural services to the military measures were resolved: (1) Collect existing cultural works. (2) Collection scope: A. Magazines, B. Pictorials, C. Books, D. Novels, E. Newspapers. (3) Collection standards: A. Rich in national consciousness and patriotic thought, B. Enhancing interest in life, C. Rich in humor, D. Simple and easy to understand, E. Each book should not exceed 100 pages. (4) Collection period: A. Long-term, B. One-time collection. (5) Collection procedures: A. General books and publications should be sent directly to the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee (address: No. 128 Seymour Road), B. Sent directly to the designated location. (6) Please ask all Shanghai broadcasting companies to increase military comfort programs, such as lectures, songs, and stories, to show military comfort. (7) Please ask Shanghai calligraphers and painters to jointly hold a military comfort charity exhibition and donate calligraphy and paintings to comfort the military. (8) Please ask theater and film directors and screenwriters to write and perform more stories related to the national spirit to inspire morale. (9) The Shanghai press should organize a military comfort visiting group to visit the Northeast, recording the touching stories of the soldiers.</p>
<h3>District Chief Bao Strongly Denies Being Falsely Accused - Willing to Accept the Death Penalty If Extortion Is Found - Councilors Testify - Did Invite Guests Indeed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Xu Jia Hui District Chief Bao Dachuan being accused of extortion and corruption was heard in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday. Bao stated in court, "The demolition of the plaintiff's house was ordered by the Municipal Government. There was no extortion. If the court finds anything, I will accept the death penalty." The plaintiff, Zhou Yinchun, said, "The house was built in 1938, and raised by four feet this year. I have been contracting air force projects in the big field. When the district chief came to notify me of the demolition, I was not at home. Later, my wife, Cheng Xiaobao, told me. The police station came with the district chief to demolish the house and said that if I paid 10 million, the district chief could help. So, on April 19, I went to Councilor Xie Qingbai to ask him to intercede with the district chief. On the 27th, Xie invited Bao to the Jieerjing restaurant, and Bao agreed to help, but he did not talk about money." Subsequently, Cheng Xiaobao was questioned and claimed that "The district chief came before 9 pm on April 16 and told me about the demolition of the house. My husband was not at home at the time. I asked him to help, and he said it would cost 10 million. Qiao Zhihe, an accountant who had recently fled from northern Jiangsu, was present." Eighth District Councilor Xie Qingbai also rushed to the court to testify, saying that Zhou had asked him to ask Bao for help and that he did invite guests on the 22nd. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer argued, pointing out that Councilor Xie had publicly called Zhou a rascal at the previous district people's congress, claiming that the request for 10 million was false, and that there were records. The plaintiff claimed that Qiao Zhihe had recently fled from northern Jiangsu, but Qiao had been in Shanghai since 1940, with a household registration booklet as proof. Wu Shaoshu's private letter was also presented, stating that Wu was willing to come to court to testify. The court ordered the case to be adjourned for further investigation and the defendant was released on the original bail.</p>

<h3>Retrial of the Maocheng Fire Case, Interrogation of Welder and Coppersmith</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Maocheng fire case was retried in the District Court yesterday. The defendants Chen Asan, a worker at Xinhua Welding Company, Yin Baozi, and Zhu Fusheng and Zhang Jingen, coppersmiths at Maocheng Company, appeared in court for the first time. Judge Cao questioned them in detail. According to Chen, "I have worked at Xinhua for nearly ten years. The sparks from the welding on the day of the fire would definitely not have caused a fire." Yin Baozi's testimony was roughly the same as Chen's. The coppersmith Zhu Fusheng stated, "There was chaff and asphalt in the interlayer between the third and second floors, but before welding, the gaps were sealed with waterproof cement. After welding, the pipe became hot, and cold water was poured on the pipe with a lead tube. After welding, I also asked Yang Shisheng, an employee of the Telecommunications Bureau, to inspect it. Although the defendant was not at the scene when the fire broke out, according to the people watching the alley, thick smoke first came out of the Naxun Road window of the warehouse, which was a long distance away from the welded pipe, and there was also a wall in between. Please investigate further." Zhang Jingen's testimony was similar to Zhu's. Then the witness Hou Xianting, who discovered the fire, was called. According to him, he returned home on the 8th at night, passed by Naxun Road, and found thick smoke coming out of the Maocheng warehouse window and heard an explosion. Next, Jiang Fuxiang, Cheng Jiajian, and Xu Xuebin, employees of the Telecommunications Bureau, were called. Jiang and Cheng both speculated that the fire must have been caused by debris in the interlayer. Xu, who was a resident employee of the Telecommunications Bureau, stated that the defendant did not pour water on the pipe with a lead tube after welding. At the end of the hearing, it was decided that the debate would be held at 10:00 AM on the 30th. The defendant remained on bail.</p>

<h3>High Court Continues to Hear Li Shiyu, Claims to Have Been Ordered to Serve in Puppet Positions with Letters and Telegrams as Evidence, Requests Testimony from Yu Xiangqin and Liu Guanxiong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Shiyu's case of suspicion of being a traitor was heard again in the High Court yesterday. Li is from Funing, Hebei. He served as the Chief Secretary of the Puppet Tianjin High Court, Standing Committee Member of the Puppet Tianjin Municipal Party Department, Puppet Legislative Member, Chief of the Military Law Department of the Puppet Shanghai Security Command, Chief of the Fourth Division of the Puppet Shanghai Branch of the Qingxiang Committee, and Chief of the Judicial Department of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. When Li appeared in court yesterday, he was wearing a white linen short shirt and trousers, light gray linen socks, and round-toed black cloth shoes. He looked thinner than before. He stated, "The puppet positions listed in the indictment are all real. Before the War of Resistance, I served as the Deputy Director of the Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Northeast Information Station of the Institute of International Affairs. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I was ordered to participate in puppet organizations to provide political and economic information to the central government. I was led by underground workers He Shizhen and Zhu Jinghua." The court asked if he knew Li Wenni, another underground worker who was the Director of the Puppet Qingxiang Training Class. He replied that he did, and that he introduced Li Wenni to the Military Intelligence Bureau in the spring of the 34th year. The court questioned him based on the testimony of witness He Quanbao, stating that they were all opportunists and had no actual work. Li replied that only the leaders knew his work, and the speculation of outsiders could not be trusted. He cited that the Military Intelligence Bureau had a telegram to prove it, and the Institute of International Affairs also had a letter of proof. He also requested that Yu Xiangqin and Liu Guanxiong of the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Office be called to testify. The court adjourned for another hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>President of Jiaotong University, Wu Baofeng, Left Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Baoli, President of National Jiaotong University, notified all departments to prepare for the handover after returning to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. Wu has been the President of Jiaotong University for six years. He initially established a branch school in Chongqing, which gradually expanded into a main campus.

<h3>Hu Shi Summoned Ma Dayou Yesterday to Discuss Accepting Beiyang University</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] After the Ministry of Education ordered Peking University to take over Beiyang University in Beiping, Hu Shi summoned Ma Dayou, the person in charge of the College of Engineering, in the morning to talk about technical issues. Ma said: After Peking University added a College of Engineering last year, only the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering were established first due to limited equipment, with a total of more than 70 students. This year, the departments of Civil Engineering and Chemical Engineering will be added, accommodating more than 200 students. The reason for not planning to take over Beiyang University in Beiping was because of the different academic systems. The College of Engineering of Peking University is a five-year system, with the first two years for basic education, and the next three years for undergraduate studies. Beiyang University in Beiping is a four-year system. Now that it has been decided to take over, it will maintain its original system. The original students of Peking University will move to the department to attend classes. The equipment is sufficient for use, and professors will be selected for employment based on their merits. It is also learned that the majority of the faculty, staff, and workers of Beiyang University in Beiping have held meetings to oppose it due to concerns about employment issues, and the alumni association of the College of Engineering of Beiping University also opposes it.</p>
<h3>Relief for Northwest Textbook Shortage, Textbooks Also Shipped</h3>
<p>[Xi'an News] The textbooks in the northwestern provinces were previously uniformly supplied by the Seventh Joint Office, with each family coordinating the supply and adjusting the surplus to make up for the shortage. This summer, the Ministry of Education changed the method of printing and supplying national textbooks, ordering the education departments of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces to find their own ways to be printed by local printing houses. After many discussions, the cost was much higher than the price limited by the Ministry of Education, making it impossible to compete with the bookstores, so no one was willing to undertake it. Therefore, they turned to consult the publishing industry to find ways to transport and sell them. However, the small bookstores in the "Shanghai Publishing Forecast" were not trustworthy, and the schools did not dare to trust them. Occasionally, those who sent money to order books did not receive any response at the deadline. As for the Commerce, Zhonghua, and Zhengzhong families of the Seventh Joint Office, they no longer have the obligation to supply national textbooks without fail at this time, and they are unwilling to waste huge transportation costs and interest and risk sacrifice. After repeated consideration, they cabled and obtained approval from the Shanghai General Administration Office to allocate a certain amount from the libraries of the Chongqing and Chengdu printing offices and ship them as soon as possible, which may be able to meet some of the needs, but it is still far from the original required amount.</p>

<h3>Chaoyang College's Finances are Extremely Tight, President Shi Hosted a Report for Tianjin Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Tianjin, 26th] Shi Zhiquan, President of Chaoyang College in Beiping, came to Tianjin a few days ago to raise funds for the college. He hosted a report for reporters from various newspapers in Tianjin on the 26th. According to the report, the college was founded in the first year of the Republic of China by Wang Youling, formerly known as Chaoyang University. Later, due to non-compliance with the establishment, it was changed to a college in the 19th year, with three departments of Law, Politics, and Economics. More than 6,000 students have graduated, and there are currently more than 1,000 students. Before the 77th Incident, the college received a government subsidy of 10,000 yuan per month. This year, it was increased to 50 million yuan, which is not enough to cover the tuition fees and subsidies received. The degree of financial difficulty is unprecedented since the establishment of the college. The salaries of faculty and staff in the college are less than half of those in other universities. Taking the president as an example, after兼主任, he only gets 600,000 yuan per month so far. Shi hopes that all sectors will provide more assistance.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] The Philippine Qunsheng Basketball Team finished their tour of Singapore and took the opportunity to play two exhibition matches in Hong Kong. They played South China on the 23rd and Hong Kong United on the 24th?</p>
<p>On the 23rd, the weather was sunny and rainy. Although the game was held at 6:00 PM, it could not be completed due to the rain, and the fans were not satisfied. Although South China is the Hong Kong champion, their skills are not yet fully developed, and they are all rising stars. It feels like Liao Hua is the vanguard, as there are no great generals in Shu. The match was simply a performance by Qunsheng. For a considerable amount of time, even the South China players were watching the other team practice "passing." There was no real competition.</p>
<p>At the start of the match, Qunsheng sent Li Shiqiao, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Jinde, and Yang Renhui to play, while South China sent Zhan Shejiang, Li Zhuowen, Che Xuan, Li Jingcheng, and Shi Zhenda to fight. In the first quarter, Qunsheng took a small victory with a score of 17 to 13. In the second quarter, South China could not cope. Qunsheng quickly scored points. Before the end of the first half, the score was already 35 to 16, with the visiting team leading by more than half. By the third quarter, the visiting team's good players were substituted off. South China took the opportunity to counterattack. When they forced the score to 44 to 26, a heavy rain fell, and the game was ended. It was a match with "nothing to see." Let's see how they do against Hong Kong United today?</p>

<h3>President Zhang of the National Bank Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing: Talks Freely on Financial and Economic Issues</h3>
<p>Reform of the Monetary System Cannot Be Achieved in the Short Term; Trade with Japan Will Never Relax Control Procedures</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Zhang Jiaxuan, President of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. He was designated by the government as one of the five representatives to liaise with Mr. Weidemei, the US special envoy. He told reporters that Mr. Wei's mission is to collect various military, political, and economic data of China. Our government is actively collecting relevant data, such as finance and economics, for Mr. Wei to report to President Truman upon his return to the United States. The staff of the National Bank is responsible for compiling financial sector materials. (1) Regarding the monetary system issue, the government is constantly conducting meticulous research. However, the word "reform" must be fully prepared, and it cannot be rushed in the short term. (2) The US loan to China is still under negotiation. (3) The issue of opening trade with Japan is of great importance and is still under study. He occasionally believes that the relationship is not very important, because our country's foreign trade is currently adopting a control policy. The import of goods from any country must be approved in advance. Items that our country does not need are not allowed to be imported. Future trade with Japan should also be like this. However, industrial raw materials are extremely scarce, and their products are difficult to compete in foreign markets. What items do we need, and what items do we not need, should be studied in detail, so as not to be completely laissez-faire. (4) During this trip to Nanjing, an agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Agriculture. For North China, it is planned to provide a steady supply of 100,000 tons, exchanging huge amounts of flour from Shanghai for coal from the north. The first batch of 300,000 bags of flour has now begun to be shipped to the north. (5) The problem of smuggling in South China has recently improved slightly. The Hong Kong authorities are gradually cooperating with us, and the phenomenon is good. The personnel of the South China Import and Export Management Committee have all been determined and will be established soon to actively carry out work. (6) The third term quota will be announced next month. The number will not be much different from the previous term. The allocation amount is awaiting approval from the National Economic Committee.</p>

<h3>The Situation of Strength Turning to Weakness Is Vague; The Rise of Chinese Stocks Is Obstructed; Yonggonghui Reaches the Limit Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were very vague yesterday, and many turned into a weak state after being strong. The yarn and flower gangs and banks bought a lot of stomach stocks. Yongsha repeatedly tried to move forward, but the ticket help had a lot of deposits and the young and strong faction of the northern gang, etc., repeatedly sold hard when they were high, and the countertop was doubled and loosened, and the upward momentum was finally obstructed. The activities were limited to Yongsha. The remaining hot stocks have the phenomenon of being unable to afford the burden and being unable to revive. Except for Yonggong, which is currently stimulated by the increase in capital, it has repeatedly reached the limit of price increase. Yongsha's price increased obviously but slightly, and Xinnuo and miscellaneous stocks, such as Commerce, Cement, and National Goods, saw an increase. The remaining stocks have had a fallback, and the trend is vague.</p>
<p>The morning opening was high, because the exchange before the gap, the number of national bank differences was even greater, and people's minds ran towards glory.

No. 235, No. 232, and No. 234 were sold, and the price dropped to below 235 yuan. No. 45, No. 207, No. 106, the banking industry had a strong buying intention, and No. 19, No. 789 also bought. At 10:10, Yonggong's current average was raised from No. 32 to the limit of price increase. Yongsha rose to 247 yuan. No. 160 and No. 223 were sold to 237 yuan. No. 106, No. 45, the financial industry, and the yarn and flower gang No. 61 still entered, and it rose again to 244 yuan.</p>
<p>After 10:50, No. 224, No. 91, No. 183, No. 94, No. 160, No. 52, and No. 152 were sold one after another, and Yongsha fell to a low price of 227 yuan.

No. 105, No. 177, No. 186, No. 85, No. 142, and No. 152 were sold one after another, and they still couldn't support it. Meyer, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Huafeng all showed lower prices. Yongsha closed at 230 yuan and 232 yuan at noon. The asking price was slightly stable after closing.</p>
<p>As a result, Yongsha's price was obviously higher but slightly equal to that of Xinnuo, with a slight increase of about half a percent compared with the previous closing price. Yonggong rose with a subsequent fallback, squeezing the rise by a little less than one and a half percent. Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, China-France, and Xinhua slightly decreased, and Mayer fell by half a percent. Commerce, Group Goods, Cement, and Labor fell by half a percent.

After continuous declines in soybeans, oil mills turned to handle them, and the street followed suit, absorbing them. Old soybeans turned to increase by 35,000 yuan. However, new soybeans from Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi all arrived, and there was not enough power to rise, so they temporarily showed a stable trend.</p>
<p>After a long period of fatigue, broad beans slightly moved, rising slightly by 34,000 yuan. There were few arrivals and departures of red beans, and there was not much honor or disgrace. Mung beans were still flat and tired. The purchase taste of Dongwan beans and Shantou was still acceptable, and the market was firm. Corn was stable, sesame was similar, and peanut kernels were purchased in Southeast Asia, suddenly becoming active, rising sharply by 120,000 yuan.

Important matters include: (1) Since taking over the Clearing House, the number of exchanges has increased month by month. The daily average amount of exchanged instruments in June of this year was over 11,694 billion yuan, with over 126,700 instruments, averaging over 9.22 million yuan per instrument, which is sufficient to indicate the gradual expansion of the scope of exchange.

The association has held repeated meetings to discuss this, and recently obtained understanding from the authorities. For banks that have not been audited, they can fill out an actual business report form, a balance sheet, an income statement, and a detailed expense statement, and submit them to the association for transmission to the National Bank's auditing department for verification. (3) Pre-war deposit issues: After repeated negotiations, the current general interpretation is that "pre-war" refers to before December 9, 1947. The maximum increase in the payment multiple is 925 times, and the minimum is 20 times." After Li's report, Wang Jiashu, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Wang Xianqing, a representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, delivered speeches successively. The discussion then began, and the following proposals were passed: (1) Regarding the solicitation and sale of US dollar bonds: The standard is the total deposit balance of each bank as of the end of July, and short-term treasury bills should be purchased in accordance with the full amount of the deposit reserve. In addition to half of the reserve that has already been purchased, the other half should be purchased as soon as possible. If any bank has difficulty in paying the full amount at once due to capital turnover, it can be paid in two installments, limited to the end of September to the end of November. As for US dollar bonds, each bank should also work hard to solicit and sell them. When encountering a tight position, the National Bank should be allowed to use them as collateral for financing at 70% of the face value. (2) The association's funding: The monthly fee portion is changed from 3,000 yuan per unit to 5,000 yuan, and the temporary fee is changed to a temporary subsidy. (3) Regarding the application for registration and licensing of the same industry, the association will submit it to the competent authority for prompt handling. (4) In accordance with the resolution of the National Banking Federation, the collection of various donations is prohibited. (Temporary motions) Research on the new tax rates for special business tax and stamp tax, and the pre-war pledge loans and other points were all passed and handed over to the board of directors and supervisors for continued discussion and handling. Finally, the revised draft of the Shanghai Banking Regulations was passed.</p>

<h3>Communists Loot Beipiao</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jing Feng</p>
<p>Jinzhou, 21st (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>Coking Expert Murdered</p>
<p>In June, the flames of war in the Northeast blazed red across half the sky. Trains between Shenyang and Changchun were impassable, replaced by mule-drawn carts. The eye of the Northeast, Xiaofengman, was unable to release electricity, and the inability to discharge water created a situation of collapse. Xi'an, Benxi, and Beipiao mining areas shut down, and the industries of various cities were directly or indirectly suspended.</p>
<p>The fifth offensive by the Northeast Communist Army created a suffocating situation in the Northeast. In the aftermath of this offensive, a tragic incident occurred: the murder of Mr. Yu Zailin, a coking expert from Beipiao. His body was exposed for four days. After the battle, all that remained of Yu Zailin was a blurred head and thirteen incomplete bones from his lower body.</p>
<p>Beipiao in western Liaoning is a well-known low-quality coal mining area. A large power plant there is even more important to the industrial and mining enterprises of Fuxin, Jinzhou, and Jinxi.</p>
<p>Beipiao's coal is one of the best coking coals in the country. Proven reserves are over 200 million tons. From the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic, and even earlier, the coal was extracted sporadically. In 1921, a joint government-business company was established for formal development. Before the September 18th Incident, the daily maximum coal output of the mine had reached about 2,500 tons. After the September 18th Incident, during the fourteen years of Japanese operation until August 15, 1945, the highest daily output was over 4,000 tons.</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrender, the mine equipment was first transported away by the Soviet army and then destroyed by the Communist army. In early January 1946, the National Army entered Beipiao. In the middle of the same month, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to take over. At that time, there were more than a thousand Chinese and Japanese employees and about eight thousand workers. Since most of the mine's machinery and equipment had been transported away, and the buildings and power equipment had been extensively damaged, the daily output after resumption of work was reduced to a hundred tons.</p>
<p>In October of the same year, the mine was taken over by the Resources Committee, which established Beipiao Coal Mine Co., Ltd. Through the efforts of employees, repairing machinery, supplementing equipment, and procuring materials, by June of this year, significant progress had been made. The daily coal output had reached 1,500 tons. The planned annual output of 400,000 tons could have been achieved ahead of schedule, but unfortunately, this drastic change occurred again!</p>
<p>In the past, the mine had been occupied, destroyed, and relocated by the Communist army four or five times. The losses in the Guanshan, Sanbao, and Nanpiao mines were significant. There was almost daily intelligence of Communist army intrusions near the mining area. Relying on employees to stand their posts and work hard, they overcame many difficulties.</p>
<p>This time, it was at 4:00 AM on June 26th. The mine was attacked by a large force of the Communist army. The ferocity broke all previous invasion records. At the same time, the Jinlingsi Railway Bridge, the transportation hub between the mining area and the outside world, was first controlled by the Communist army, and the mine employees had no way to advance or retreat. General Manager Lei Baohua requested reinforcements from Jinzhou. At this time, the responsible persons in the factory, including Ding Yaozhong, the director of the employee affairs department, Zhang Qingchun, the director of the general affairs department, and Yu Zailin, the director of the engineering department, personally led the mine police and soldiers to resist desperately, waiting for reinforcements.</p>
<p>On the 29th, a part of the National Army stationed in the mine was disarmed by the Communist army. Before noon on July 1st, the last part of the National Army was also disarmed. The mine police of more than seven hundred people died in large numbers due to the exhaustion of ammunition. On July 1st, they and all the mine employees were captured at the same time. Yu Zailin, the director of the engineering department, was killed at that time. More than fifty other senior and middle-level employees, including Ding Yaozhong and Zhang Qingchun, were captured.</p>
<p>The entire mine fell into enemy hands at 2:00 PM on July 1st. During their eight days in Beipiao, the Communist army transported away all the movable working machines, tools, and mining materials and equipment, such as coal cars, ball bearings, safety lamps, explosives, detonators, electricity, motors, steel plates, and steel bars. Because the reinforcements were coming, knowing that they could not stay, they retreated on the afternoon of the 8th, taking the captured personnel with them.</p>
<p>The National Army rescuing the mining area was delayed in the middle of the journey and was only able to enter Beipiao on July 9th.</p>
<p>Today, the mining area has been recovered. Fortunately, the major equipment such as the power plant has not been destroyed, but all the personnel, equipment, and self-defense forces have been lost. The employees have lost their sense of security, and the engineering leaders have been captured. They are all extremely discouraged and unwilling to risk going again.</p>
<p>Now, the mine is requesting urgent disaster relief, appeasing the displaced employees, sending the families of the captured personnel, and forming a temporary agency to maintain everything in the mining area, transporting grain and funds to stabilize the workers. As for how to resume work, because of the many difficulties, it will have to be two months later!</p>
<h3>Taiwan Flood</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Taipei, 20th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiwan almost never has a year without disasters: typhoons, floods, these natural disasters hinder the progress of construction, destroy existing construction, and deepen the suffering of the general public of farmers. The government, while constructing, has to prepare repair costs equal to the construction costs, or else it can only seek permanent construction. However, the Japanese were unable to do this in the past, and the authorities after the takeover are even more unable to bear the double construction costs.</p>
<p>From late May to early June of this year, the entire island was immersed in thunderstorms for a whole month, which was even worse than the yellow fog season in the interior. Because of the thunderstorms, the streams surged, and the embankments collapsed, resulting in the submergence of fields, the loss and destruction of livestock and houses, and the death and injury of villagers. In addition, mountain torrents erupted, and landslides and ground fissures directly destroyed roads and bridges and blocked transportation. According to statistics, the rainfall in these twenty-two days from May 24th to June 16th was 1,265.8 mm, exceeding the rainfall in the same period in 1946. Taking Taichung County as an example, the continuous rainfall for twelve days in June was 774.3 mm, which has not been seen in decades.</p>
<p>The most serious situation in this flood was in Taichung County. The revised loss figures of the county are: (1) 61 sections of embankments collapsed; (2) 50,000 mu of land was buried and lost; (3) 21 people died and 91 were injured; (4) 680 heads of livestock such as cattle, sheep, and pigs died; (5) 1,826 households were affected; (6) Property, rice, sweet potatoes, and transportation losses: The total value is 5,855,200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>An elderly senator, at a symposium convened by Chairman Wei, loudly exclaimed: "You can't see the disaster in the city, but when you see it in the disaster area, the devastation is unbearable." When reporters followed Chairman Wei to inspect the breach of the Wu River, the guide said, "This is just one breach, there are many breaches that need to be repaired urgently, and the farmers are begging for relief and repairs."</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Water Conservancy Group of the Public Works Bureau, there are problems with 111 embankments throughout the province, including Taichung, Hsinchu, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Dongtainan Bay. The total length of the washout is 9,656m, and the length of the gaps also reaches 7,589m. Most of them are embankment feet, embankment slopes, washouts, collapses, and gaps.</p>
<p>Disasters are sufficient to test the strength of the people and the concern of the government. The people of Taiwan have reached a climax in this performance. After the Taichung flood, the County Council and the government established a Flood Emergency Relief Committee, first borrowing money from banks in the county to repair the embankments to prevent the streams from rising again and expanding the gaps. At the same time, they promptly handled damage surveys and relief work. Under the financial constraints, the relief funds required 13 million yuan. In addition to provincial and county subsidies, they also launched donations in various townships, distributed clothes and food allowances to the victims, and provided death compensations. The emotions were as tense as putting out a fire. In the repair of the embankments, the engineering personnel of the Public Works Bureau and the Civil Engineering Section of the County Government provided technical cooperation and issued subsidies. For the gap parts, bamboo baskets in the shape of bamboo shoots were used to build dams and temporary embankments. For the washout parts, bamboo snakes were used for emergency repairs. Among them, the Wufeng gap was repaired by mobilizing 500 workers every day, and it was completed in a few days.</p>
<p>Highways and railways were directly damaged. However, due to emergency repairs, there were no long delays in traffic. In Taiwan, you can see the scene of emergency completion of processing and manufacturing. Engineering technicians are at their best trial at this time.</p>
<p>Without water conservancy, there would be no Taiwan. Taiwan was constructed into an island with abundant sugarcane, rice, and fruits through the artificial construction of water conservancy by the Japanese. No mechanical scientific power can change the topography of the island. The Central Mountain Range, this watershed, pours into the sea like a waterfall when it rains. It is short, turbulent, and dangerous. In the past, there were plans to prevent floods and afforestation to prevent rain, but now they have not been moved at all. It seems that it is becoming more and more difficult to prevent natural disasters with human power!</p>
<p>The flood is still the first page of this year's disaster. The typhoon that can sweep across the Pacific at any time is stretching out its ruined hand and will attack seabirds without warning, even if it breaks through the meteorological forecast network!</p>

<h3>Yu Zailin's Martyrdom Before and After</h3>
<p>Yu Zailin, a coking expert, whose courtesy name is Zuiling, was 39 years old this year. He was from Diangang Village, Dongxiang Township, Sheng County, Zhejiang. In July 1932, he graduated from Tianjin National Beiyang Institute of Technology. He served as an intern at the Kailuan Mining Bureau, a technician at the Construction Committee, an assistant researcher at the National Defense Design Committee and the Qiyuan Committee Mining Office, and a technician at the Ministry of Economic Affairs Mining and Metallurgy Research Institute. In November 1942, he was sent to the United States for investigation. In April 1945, he returned to China and served as the director of the Washing and Coking Plant of Tianfu Mining Company. After the victory, he was transferred to the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Northeast as a takeover commissioner and was successively sent to work at the Changchun and Fushun Mining Bureaus. In December 1946, he was transferred to the Beipiao Coal Mine Company as the director of the Engineering Department. He had served in the mining and metallurgy industry for 15 years and was particularly respected for his experience. He was one of the few smelting experts in China and had written many works. His parents died early, leaving behind his wife and three sons and two daughters, who are now all in their hometown of Sheng County, Zhejiang. His family has no permanent property, and his death was bleak. Yu was brutally murdered at 2:00 PM on July 1, when the Beipiao Coal Mine fell. His body was exposed until July 9, when the mine was recovered. Because it had been pecked at by birds and animals, only the head and twelve sections of bones remained, making it almost impossible to identify. The situation was extremely tragic. His remains have now been transported to Jinzhou for re-burial, and a memorial service is scheduled for August 1. (Sent by Jing Feng from Jinzhou)</p>
<h3>A Complete Picture of Guangxi Agriculture: From Barren Land to Oasis</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>Wuzhou, 20th (Airmail)</p>
<p>A desolate desert may not bloom with beautiful flowers or bear abundant fruit, but the laborers who cultivate barren land often inspire a sense of utmost respect. Guangxi, located on the southern border, has been dauntingly barren since the Qin dynasty expanded its territory. Over thousands of years, people migrating to the Guiling mountains have opened up avenues of production with their own hands. To this day, barren lands have transformed from infertility to oases.</p>
<p>In Guangxi agriculture, only the southeastern river areas can be considered to have some produce. In the northwest corner, mountains stretch endlessly, and smoke from cooking fires extends for miles. Besides relying on mountains for fields and struggling to plant corn and sweet potatoes for a year's sustenance, there is practically nothing. Therefore, people's lives are especially difficult. The number of people who do not see a single grain of rice all year round, and only fill their stomachs with miscellaneous grains, accounts for more than 15%. When famine strikes, mountain floods erupt, and crops in the valleys are swept away. When drought comes, mountain water sources dry up easily. Therefore, during disasters, compatriots in the northwest corner of Guangxi die particularly quickly and tragically. It is truly lamentable to speak of!</p>
<p>Rice, Beans, and Millet: Alleviating Guangdong and Hong Kong's Needs</p>
<p>Although agricultural products in the southeast are not abundant or precious, the yearly income from hard work is considerable. If production methods can be rapidly improved and natural and man-made disasters reduced, the future is promising. The products include rice, beans, millet, potatoes, peanuts, etc. If there are no poor harvests, there is a considerable surplus, which is then used to alleviate the needs of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and other places. In the past two years, there was a great famine in Hunan and Guangdong. If it were not for the rice from Guangxi, the consequences would have been even more severe. Having to share their own scarce food with others, the hardships of the people can be imagined. In the river basin area, 65% is paddy fields. In the southeastern half, from Nanning to Wuzhou, there are generally two harvests a year (once in July and once in October), yielding about 14 million dan, which is supplied to the whole province and as far as Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong. This year, severe floods have caused a loss of no less than 20,000 mu. Farmers in towns like Zhenbian have even been forced to commit suicide as entire families. Putting a grain of rice in their mouths is filled with indescribable bitterness!</p>
<p>Five Kinds of Plants: Relied Upon by Millions</p>
<p>Besides rice and miscellaneous grains, because most of Guangxi province is hilly terrain and has a subtropical climate, many farmers also rely on other crops for a living. Cotton, hemp, tobacco, sugarcane, and tung oil have all had considerable production in recent years. The number of people who depend on these five plants for food exceeds four million.</p>
<p>Cotton-Producing Areas: 4 Million Mu</p>
<p>Cotton production only became noticed after 1936. The southwest area of Guangxi is a cotton-growing area, so the yield is far less than that of Shaanxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. However, the cotton-growing area has rapidly increased to more than 4 million mu in ten years, with an annual output of more than 1.12 million dan. The production areas are distributed in the upper reaches of the Pearl River. Every year, the products are processed into cotton yarn and then transported and sold to the interior, as far as Yunnan and Guizhou, becoming the largest source of family handicrafts. The beauty and durability of Guilin homespun fabric is something that those who stayed in the rear during the War of Resistance probably have a deep impression of. Secondly, in areas such as Pingle, Hexian, and Yulin in eastern Guangxi, the textile industry is also very developed. Some women even dedicate their entire lives to weaving and do not marry, also making a living. Recently, in order to develop the province's light industry, the construction authorities have started with the textile industry, investing heavily in setting up textile production cooperatives in Wanglin and other places, to provide standards.</p>
<p>Ramie Production: Less Than Cotton</p>
<p>As for ramie production, it is far less developed than cotton. Only in northern and western Guangxi, there are about 455,000 mu of hemp fields, which can produce about 600,000 dan per year. The market for ramie is concentrated in Pingle and other places in eastern Guangxi, and most of it is exported to other provinces, because the quality still needs to be improved, so sales are very low.</p>
<p>Growing Tobacco Makes a Fortune: 200,000 per Dan</p>
<p>In Guangxi, people who grew tobacco this year have made a fortune. A dan of tobacco leaves can fetch a price of more than 200,000 yuan, and merchants are still afraid of not getting enough. It is estimated that the total tobacco sales in the province can generate 100 billion yuan in revenue. As foreign exchange rates are high and the sales of foreign cigarettes are declining, Guiyang, Guangzhou, and other places have set up factories to manufacture their own cigarettes. The cigarette factories in Guangxi that had closed down in the past have also made a comeback, competing with foreign cigarettes. Taking advantage of local materials, the value of tobacco has increased tenfold, and this year's harvest has also been bountiful, so the only ones who can smile are the tobacco farmers. The tobacco-producing areas are mostly in northern Guangxi, about 300,000 mu.</p>
<p>The Opium Problem: Not Quite Dead</p>
<p>Thinking about many issues from a single word like "tobacco" often increases a sense of mystery. Besides tobacco, opium seems to be in a state of rebirth and not dead in the mountains of northwestern Guangxi. Although the law puts the word "death" on people's heads, many people feel that the word "money" is more interesting than "death." This spring, various places started to eradicate opium, and Tianhe County eradicated 100,000 plants in one go. Almost none of the county heads sent to the border between Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou did not lose their positions because of opium. In Xilong and Xilin counties, poppies were planted on the roadside, ignoring the authorities. The cooked opium paste is sold for 150,000 yuan per liang in western Guangxi, and the further east along the river, the more profitable it becomes. Therefore, Baise, a small city in western Guangxi, has appropriately become a paradise for adventurers. If poppies are also included in agricultural products, one cannot help but think of Xikang half a year ago....</p>
<p>Sugar Industry: A Model Example</p>
<p>In Guangxi, the only industrial product that is relatively well-known is the sugar industry, which can be regarded as a model. From Nanning through Guixian to Dakoujiang of Guiping, it can be called a sweet city. The sugarcane fields stretching across this area reach 223,333 mu, with an annual output of 6.7 million zu of cane sugar. Among them, Guixian is a special case. In 1936, the provincial government established the largest sugar factory in the country here, hiring foreign technicians to engage in mass production. Although it was bombed by enemy aircraft during the war, it has established the foundation of the Guangxi sugar industry. Now the province is working hard to restore it, and the future is promising. At present, there are small sugar factories everywhere in Guixian, selling no less than 3 million dan to northern Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangdong every year, which is the most promising path in Guangxi's small industry. Unfortunately, this year's floods and subsequent insects have caused incalculable damage to sugarcane fields, which is a major catastrophe for the sugar industry.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Production and Sales: Gradually Heading Upward</p>
<p>Tung oil production and sales were also quite reputable in Guangxi before the war. The planting area was nearly 253,000 mu, with an annual output of 311,800 dan. Exports to Hong Kong and Guangdong reached 220,000 dan, accounting for more than 70% of the output. After the war, exports were cut off, followed by the destruction of the war, so it almost fell into decline. However, because tung oil is an essential raw material for industry, the trend of smuggling to help the enemy during the war was rampant, becoming a major disaster. After the war, based on the needs of the international market, the tung oil industry has revived. Although it has not been able to increase production for a while, the authorities have been actively paying attention to promoting widespread planting. 70% of the province's land is suitable for planting tung trees, especially in northwestern Guangxi, where the mountains are bare and the fields are barren for miles. Even the official wasteland is as much as 400,000 mu. If it can be vigorously developed, with ten years of tree planting, when the green plains are lush, what are we afraid of: perpetual disasters and drought? The most terrible thing is to shed tears for the starving on the one hand, and not to think about the reasons why the starving are starving on the other hand. Considering the national economy and people's livelihood, we really must make timely efforts.</p>
<p>Fennel and Cinnamon: Sold Widely at Home and Abroad</p>
<p>In addition, specialties such as fennel and cinnamon in Longzhou, southern Guangxi, have fennel for medicine and oil extraction, mixed with star anise oil, with an annual output of more than 18,000 dan, which is a treasure of Chinese medicine. The latter also produces 40,000 dan of cinnamon twigs and 700 dan of cinnamon oil every year, which are sold at home and abroad. If it can be improved in detail, there are also unlimited benefits.</p>
<p>Tropical Fruits: Mass Production</p>
<p>Next in line, tropical fruits can also be said to have everything. In Beiliu, Rongxian, and other places, the orchards are as wide as dozens of miles. Lychees, longans, bananas, watermelons... are all produced in large quantities. Rongxian Shatianyous are even famous throughout the country, more than Fuzhou pomelos. If it were not for the years of disasters, Guangxi should not be so terribly bitter. However, in fact, today's Guangxi is deeply mired in the abyss of starvation. One year of war and two years of drought have caused the rural economy to collapse like a mountain. A grain of rice contains a tear, and they have to endure many nameless sufferings. Who knows when there will be a good harvest?</p>
<h3>The Abundance Celebration Ship Struck a Reef and Was Destroyed by Fire in the Waters of Dapeng Bay</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Wind Signal No. 1: Could Not Avert Disaster - Alert Captain: Foreign Warships Rescued</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 23rd (Airmail)</p>
<p>Property: All Gone</p>
<p>Lives: Fortunately Safe</p>
<p>Since the "Xi'an" ship, which sailed the Hong Kong-Guangdong line this spring, caught fire in Hong Kong and burned more than 100 passengers to death, sea passengers have been deeply wary. Unexpectedly, on the 19th of this month, the "Fengqing" giant ship with a displacement of 6,167 tons struck a reef and had an accident in the middle of the night on the way from Hong Kong to Shantou. The ship was sailing on the Singapore-Hong Kong-Shantou-Xiamen route. This time, it carried nearly 2,000 returning overseas Chinese from Singapore. When the tragedy occurred, there was a hurricane raging. For a time, the sound of the wind and rain was mixed with the cries for help from women and children. Fortunately, British and American warships rushed to the rescue, and the passengers were all rescued. However, public and private property was completely lost, including the hard-earned blood and sweat of many overseas Chinese over the years, which was all gone in an instant, making them feel extremely miserable.</p>
<p>The Fengqing ship originally belonged to the German Prince Mail Ship Company. After World War I, it was listed as a U.S. war trophy. Later, the U.S. sold the ship to the San Francisco China Mail Ship Company, renamed Lili. In 1933, Hefeng Company bought the ship for HK$750,000, renamed Fengqing, and sailed on the Nanyang route. When World War II broke out, the British government requisitioned the Fengqing, specializing in transporting military supplies in the Indian Ocean. It encountered danger twice but escaped unscathed. After the war, it still sailed on the original route. Because it was a national ship, it was popular with overseas Chinese. Its career was prosperous, and its profits were very high. It is said that before his death, the Founding Father traveled to the United States twice on this ship to promote the revolution, which is still talked about by Hefeng Company.</p>
<p>Encountering a Hurricane: Alert Captain</p>
<p>The Fengqing ship sailed from Singapore to Hong Kong this time with more than 3,000 people. Excluding those who disembarked in Hong Kong, there were 630 people going to Shantou and 580 people going to Xiamen, including children, about 1,400 people, plus crew members, vendors, etc., totaling nearly 2,000 people. It left Hong Kong at 7 pm on the 18th. Half an hour later, the Hong Kong Customs hung up Wind Signal No. 1. (If the ship was scheduled to set sail after 7:30 pm, the departure would inevitably be postponed due to the impending hurricane.) Unfortunately, the ship had already set sail and could not return. At 3:50 am on the 19th, a strong wind blew and huge waves were like mountains. The ship was sailing in the waters of Dapeng Bay and could not withstand the impact of the storm, so it struck a reef. At that time, in order to protect the lives of the passengers, the captain continued to move forward after hitting the reef. As a result of moving forward, although the hull was cracked, it could still be stranded on the reef. If it went into reverse, the whole ship would be in danger of sinking immediately. Because of the captain's alertness and decisiveness, the lives of 2,000 people were preserved, which can be said to be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Hull Cracked: Cries Shocked the Sky</p>
<p>In order to understand the actual situation after the accident, the reporter interviewed Mr. Chen Weixiong, a passenger who returned from the accident. According to reports, there were winds and waves after the ship left Hong Kong. After nightfall, the passengers went to sleep early. He also felt dizzy due to excessive turbulence. Around 3 am, he suddenly heard a loud noise. He jumped up and walked to the deck. At that time, the ship's gong was ringing loudly, indicating that it had hit a reef and was in danger. The whole ship was lit up with electric lights, and the order was disrupted. The cries of women and children shook the sky, and they scrambled for lifebuoys. The state of panic was indescribable. After the hull was stranded on the reef, the huge waves gradually cracked it into three sections, with the head facing the sky and the rest sinking. The passengers gathered at the bow of the ship, waiting for the arrival of death. His leather shoes were also lost in the chaos, and all seven pieces of luggage fell into the sea.</p>
<p>Three Warships: Rescued Bravely</p>
<p>At 6 am on the 19th, a Russian merchant ship "Nahoda" happened to pass by. Knowing that the Fengqing was in distress, it sailed closer to attempt to rescue. However, the wind was very strong and there were many reefs. The Russian ship did not dare to get close. At 6:30 am, the British warship "Hart" sped in. Initially, the warship planned to use the method of transferring ships, approaching the Fengqing. Twice it attempted to dock, but the steel cables were broken by the strong wind. It had no choice but to use small boats to rescue. Each boat could hold more than ten people. Women and children were first, and the old and weak were second. The order was still good. Later, the American warships "Herkins" and "Fox" arrived at 8 am, and the Taikoo Company's "Hunan" ship also arrived at 11 am. They cooperated to rescue. British soldiers guarded the ladders to prevent crowding. However, once the ship was about to tip over, the people in the back rushed to get out first, and the order was disrupted. The British warship fired chemical bullets from the machine gun at the "Fengqing," and the crowd calmed down slightly. By 7:30 pm, all the passengers had safely left the ship, boarded the warships, and returned to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Rescued Alive: Property All Lost</p>
<p>When Mr. Chen arrived in Hong Kong, he and other passengers were sent to Taoyuan by Hefeng Company for temporary accommodation. The reporter then went to Taoyuan to inspect and saw more than a thousand overseas Chinese sitting on the ground, with nothing but the clothes on their backs. During the rescue, the warships did not allow any luggage to be brought on board, even small packages had to be thrown into the sea. Among the overseas Chinese, many had worked abroad for decades and brought their families back to their hometowns to retire. This time, their lives were saved, but all their property was lost. How would they make a living after returning to their hometowns? The sadness was evident in their faces, which was truly tragic.</p>
<p>Wreckage Burned: Misfortunes Never Come Singly</p>
<p>Hefeng Company has decided to send the passengers to Shantou and Xiamen back to their hometowns for free to deal with the aftermath. In addition, each person will be given HK$50 for travel expenses. As for the loss of luggage, the company said that the matter was extraordinary and it has suffered heavy losses itself, so it cannot compensate. The stranded overseas Chinese are currently petitioning the Hong Kong government, asking for relief, but there is no result yet. The wreckage of the Fengqing that had not yet sunk suddenly caught fire and was destroyed, which is believed to have been caused by pirates looting and setting fire. It is truly a case of misfortunes never come singly.</p>
<h3>Major Coal Mine Disaster in Yiyang, Henan: More Than 100 Workers Buried in the Mine</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Boquan</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 22nd (Airmail)</p>
<p>The Yiyang coal mine in Henan Province has abundant output and good coal quality. Since the major coal mines in Fenglezhen, Anyang, Jiaozuo, and other places were destroyed by the Communist army one after another, the authorities have paid close attention to the Yiyang coal mine. The Ligou mine in the county has been working day and night since it was exploited by the Yiluo Coal Mine Engineering Office in June 1946, sparing no effort. In a few months, the daily coal output reached more than 200 tons. Therefore, the engineering office has been working hard to expand the underground roadways in the mine, but there are only two well eyes on the ground. The air is not circulating, and the equipment is very simple. The safety of the workers has never been paid much attention to. Once suffocated by the air, they have no solution and are left to die. There have been few improvements. At around 12 o'clock on the night of July 3, a sudden explosion occurred in the mine, the sound of which reverberated through the clouds. 146 miners working above and below ground were there and 41 managed to escape in time. 37 were slightly or seriously injured. Over 100 people were trapped at the bottom of the mine. As of 3 pm on the 4th, no emergency rescue measures had been found, which is very worrying. It is generally believed that this unfortunate event was caused by simple equipment. The victims' families cried and wailed, which was heartbreaking.</p>

<h3>Appealing to Compatriots from All Walks of Life to Economize on Food and Clothing to Help the Flood Victims in Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Our newspaper will collect donations on behalf of the bank from today and transfer them to the bank</p>
<p>This summer, floods in Guangdong and Guangxi have inundated hundreds of miles, and dozens of counties have become swamps. The number of people and animals who died is countless. The fields and crops have been submerged, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. The houses have been washed away, and the losses are enormous. The flood victims have no way to appeal for help. The tragedy is indescribable. Mr. Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, Bai Chongxi, Song Ziwen, Shao Lizi, Ye Gongchao, Dong Xianchu, and other people from Guangdong and Guangxi have been rescuing the victims and raising relief funds. The newspapers have all reported on it. I know that people at sea will not be able to sleep or eat well when they hear of this tragedy. So how can we help? The key is to save money to help the victims, contribute effort, run around to raise funds, and donate money. The more the better. If our 4 million citizens in Shanghai have this heart and work together to raise funds, the effect will be considerable. "Helping neighbors in distress" is an ancient lesson. People often say "It is most joyful to do good." Let all the citizens of Shanghai rise up and take action. I pay my respects to the victims of disaster nine times.</p>
<p>Letter from the Fund-Raising Committee of the Guangdong-Guangxi Flood Relief Association: Dear Sir, Our association officially started working on the second floor of No. 336 Jiangning Road (Gordon Road) on July 20. The donation books have also been printed. There are three copies. The first copy is a temporary receipt, which is given to the donor. The second copy is the donation delivery form, which is used to pay the donation to the bank. The third copy is the stub, which is kept by the fundraiser or organization for future reference. After each book is used up, the stub will be sent to our association for verification. As for the banks that collect donations on our behalf, our association has designated four banks: Shanghai, Xinhua, Guangdong, and Zhonghui. It has been noted on the cover of the donation book that you have a thorough understanding of social services and benefit the people. Therefore, we have sent 20 donation books from our association to you and hope you will check and promote them. We are grateful.

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>Leaving Home for Eight Years and Returning in Triumph: The Old Residence Was Assessed and Completely Changed</p>
<p>Dear Editor: In 1916, my friend Mr. Ling gave me a house in lieu of money worth one thousand yuan. The term was six years, and it expired in 1922. Mr. Ling was unable to redeem it and did not request to renew the lease. In 1937, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and I withdrew westward with the army. After the victory, I returned and saw that the house was still standing alone, but it was occupied by Mr. Ling again, and he had registered with the government before me. According to the Civil Code, if the redemption period of an item exceeds twenty years, the property rights should belong to the pledgee. Please ask: (1) According to the above situation, should this house belong to the pledgee? (2) To whom should the land occupied by the house belong? (3) Is it valid to apply for an objection after the government's land registration announcement period expires and before the property ownership certificate has been reissued? (4) If the land registration authority refuses to accept it, can a lawsuit be filed in court? Please give me answers to the above four points, and I will be very grateful. Reader Wu Yizhi</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan's Answer] (1) If the pledger does not redeem the item at the original pledge price after two years of the expiration of the pledge period, the pledgee obtains the ownership of the pledged item. (2) Since the pledged item is a house, it does not include the land. (3) To claim ownership of the pledged house, a lawsuit should be filed in court to resolve the issue. As for declaring an objection to the land administration authority, it can be done at any time. (4) If the land administration authority refuses to accept the declaration of objection, a lawsuit can be filed in court to resolve the issue.</p>

<h3>On the Art of Cinema</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>The progress of cinematic art has surpassed the achievements of all past art forms. It is the younger sister of the new arts of the 20th century, more comprehensive and expansive than theater. Some call it the "Eighth Art." Indeed, since the perfection of cinematic art, the universe and human life have undergone extraordinary transformations. We appreciate the gifts of cinematic art itself, and, moreover, we discover its "true value" to humanity in terms of philosophy, cosmology, and outlook on life. This true value shows the unique qualities of cinematic art compared to other arts.</p>
<p>The Unity of Science and Art</p>
<p>The invention of cinema, unlike other arts, does not rely solely on human effort. It is not like sculpture, which relies solely on carving, music, which relies solely on orchestras, or painting, which relies solely on colored brushes. Its growth process is a series of scientific inventions and advancements.</p>
<p>Cinema originated from the invention of photography. "Still films" then evolved continuously, giving rise to "lantern slides." Lantern slides further developed into "moving pictures," eventually culminating in story-driven silent films—movies without sound.</p>
<p>Further scientific discoveries, such as the conversion of sound waves into light waves and the reflection of light waves back into sound waves, led to the evolution of silent films into talkies.</p>
<p>With the emergence of natural color film, color movies have dominated the world film market at this stage, cherished by the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>Beyond the satisfaction of sight and sound, "sensory stimulation" will be projected during movie screenings, making movies an art form with both color and aroma!</p>
<p>The above deduction and narration prove that the development of this artistic realm is due to the gifts of science. The achievements of science are precisely the achievements of art, uniting what was previously considered to be science in opposition to art, and now blooming into magnificent artistic buds in the realm of science! This cannot but be regarded as a new creation in the universe.</p>
<p>The Interweaving of Time and Space</p>
<p>Theater is a three-dimensional spatial-temporal art. Cinema, although also limited to a certain space—the screen—still expresses three-dimensional objects and phenomena, also products of the spatial-temporal dimension. The screen and the stage have the same effect: within a limited time and space, they can express events occurring in an infinitely long time and space. This shortens the distance between "past," "present," and "future" in time, and also shrinks the vastness of the universe in space—the east, west, south, and north—every place!</p>
<p>Moreover, the universe's phenomena are a great flowing current of change, with time and space being the basic framework of all things. The expression of any art is limited by space; the scope of cinema is all-encompassing. Everything in the universe can be captured by the camera, without any obstacles. In an instant, it can switch from the wilderness to the ocean, and from the tropics to the arctic. It realizes Shakespeare's famous saying: "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." The expansiveness of cinema's subject matter surpasses that of any other art.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the changes of "time" have unlimited breadth within the limited garden of the screen—within a small space. Time often forms the trajectory of movement in space. The magic of cinema is that it advances time through space, incorporating several imagined spatial coordinates into "one" unchanging "space."</p>
<p>As for the sequence of human life, under the mercury lamps, it can often be changed at will. Sometimes, the "wedding" scene is filmed first, and then the "engagement." This kind of "spatialization of time" jumps breaks the mundane life sequence and is a great creation of cinematic art.</p>
<p>The Relativity of Motion and Stillness</p>
<p>All things in the universe are constantly being created, so the universe is inherently a flow of change. Time is inherently a part of that change; because time is ever-present, all things in the universe are in motion. In fact, what we call "stillness" is merely a relative term to "motion." It only signifies the existence of a certain material state. If this philosophy is considered profound, cinema can be used to prove it.</p>
<p>Human "movement" is nothing more than the continuous expression of a process of changing from one posture to another. Photography is often a "still image" of an object's momentary existence. "Motion" is often the result of the continuous transformation of individual "still images" in a short period. Sixteen still images can be obtained in one minute, and these sixteen different postures, when projected continuously under light, form "movement" and are endowed with life. Therefore, the art of cinema is nothing more than an explanation of the relationship between "stillness" and "motion" in the universe.</p>
<p>In terms of the technical aspects of filmmaking, there are many variations in speed, such as "fast motion" and "slow motion." By "coordinating" real-life movements with changes in the speed of filming, several illusions can be created. These illusions often explain or analyze human life and natural phenomena. This is another great wonder of cinema.</p>
<p>When a movie is projected on the screen, the screen itself is a static space; however, this static container conceals countless "dynamic" states! A person sitting on a train appears to be static, but the train is moving, which is an example of Einstein's theory of relativity. Similarly, the story portrayed in cinematic art is dynamic, but the screen itself is static, seemingly illustrating another aspect of relativity.</p>
<p>Based on this relative perception of "motion" and "stillness," filmmaking often uses illusions to reverse the order of moving and still objects. For example, the movement of trains or airplanes is often filmed in a studio, and then a moving background is "replicated" and superimposed. When projected, the audience believes that the train is moving and the airplane is flying. This kind of photographic technique that deceives the audience is created by deeply understanding the relativity of motion and stillness. This is another explanation of the universe's concepts by cinematic art.</p>
<p>The Connection of Dreams and Reality</p>
<p>Dreams are often products of imagination, and imagination is often something that is desirable but unattainable. In the realm of literature and art, no creation can express imagination concretely, subtly, and three-dimensionally. Because the head of "idealism" may soar into the sky, "reality" is, after all, merely something on the ground. However, since the advent of cinema, it has overcome past difficulties, expressing what is desirable but unattainable, holistically and realistically. For example, talking birds, trees that can make fire, gods flying through the clouds and seas, demons charming holy couples, boats sailing on land, and the splitting of the sea. Due to the advancement of cinematic art techniques, all "impossibilities" have been overcome! There is no such word as "impossible" in the realm of cinema. All dreams can become reality, which can satisfy the pursuit of personality and spirit. The essence of cinema is to make people have "daydreams." It is the "dark light" of the human spirit! Cinematic art is reality in dreams, and even more so, it is reality in dreams!</p>
<p>Especially in the realm of fantasy, no one can see themselves outside of themselves, but cinema can allow actors to sit in the audience and appreciate their own creations. What is this if not a dream of life? Yet it is "real."</p>
<p>The Extreme of Sight and Sound</p>
<p>All art forms provide "entertainment for the senses," but the enjoyment of sight and sound differs in each. For example, painting has the visual experience of color, while music belongs solely to the realm of hearing. Performing arts have advanced to a comprehensive expression of sound, light, lines, etc., but they ultimately cannot match the pinnacle of achievement bestowed by cinematic art, which is aided by science! Cinema uses electricity, light, sound, and color directly and compatibly, giving the audience the greatest sensory experience of sight and sound! The so-called "three-dimensional color movie" can be called the new pride of sensory art in the 20th century!</p>
<p>Theatrical performance often uses the actors themselves as tools for artistic expression. Dynamic artistic creations often cannot be preserved, but cinema can make up for this defect! A concentrated and astonishing performance can be passed down to future generations! Therefore, cinema has also taken away the honorable throne of theatrical art! It has completed a symphony of human sensory enjoyment!</p>
<p>In conclusion, cinematic art has enjoyed the love of people all over the world in the 20th century. Its uniqueness and universality are worthy of praise! In the philosophy of art, we must seek the reasons for its achievements. The above analysis explains the reasons why the art of cinema leads people into a state of meditative concentration.</p>
<h3>Fish Dance and Fly</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Ancient people did not write without origin. Yu Kai’s poem “Swimming in the Painting Screen” says: "Bamboo moves and cicadas contend to scatter, and even fish fly temporarily." Zhang Yan’s poem “North Pavilion of Xiangzhou” says: “Duckweed scatters and fish dance, and the forest sings with birds." Cicadas scattering and birds singing are common phrases, but the use of "fly" and "dance" to describe fish seems rather unusual. However, the "Classic of Fish Farming" states: "If the fish is not guarded, it will fly away in the rain." The "Book of Han" also has the saying: "Emperor Xuan floated east on the Yellow River, and the divine fish danced in the river." Thus, the words "fly" and "dance" are not without origin.</p>
<h3>Ballet Lessons</h3>
<p>— Bao Jia</p>
<p>Bao Jia (Hagar Degas Sesg-1017) is one of the Impressionist painters, whose works are mostly figures, and he is especially good at pastels. With gorgeous colors, light brushstrokes, and noble character, this work can be regarded as a representative. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Casual Talk on Painting Inscriptions</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>My friend, Huang Yao, nicknamed "Cow Nose," once asked me to introduce twenty colleagues to gather for a small drink when he first arrived in Guilin, with the condition that they must be "genuinely humorous." I excused myself due to my lack of talent, because there are countless painters, but few who understand painting, and those who gather together with the smell of money only praise each other, not knowing where "humor" lies.</p>
<p>Now that I have returned to Chun Shen, I am putting aside my desire to make a name for myself, because there are so many talented people in Shanghai, and I dare not pretend to be an expert. I would not want to hang a refined sign and try to be a famous artist, only to be ridiculed by Zheng Banqiao and others. Although I cannot paint, I like to pretend to be an expert. When I talk to my friend Lu Danlin about Chinese painting, I always feel that the prevailing trend is going against tradition, and people are only trying to make a name for themselves. Painters are often loud and flashy, focusing on superficiality, and I feel that even the glass factory in Beiping is not as good as the Shanghai art scene in terms of business acumen. (Danlin has already written about this, so I won't go into detail.)</p>
<p>As for the inscription on the painting, I often feel that even those who are not famous raise flags and boast about each other. Although inscription is not the most important aspect of painting, it can enhance or detract from the quality of the work. Therefore, the most important thing in inscription is calligraphy, followed by literary talent, and then the seal. If any of these three is missing, the inscription will easily become vulgar. If Li Sixun's landscape painting were inscribed with Huai Su's cursive script, the delicate picture would be ruined. Therefore, Zhao Songxue and Dong Qichang's running script should be used to inscribe Wang Shi's landscape paintings, and Mo Jie's poems and Hui Shu's seals should be used. As for [unclear characters] painting, the opposite is true. Therefore, Master Wu Changshuo's poetry, calligraphy, painting, and seals are all indispensable.</p>
<p>If the inscription for bamboo painting uses "Leaves drooping like a thousand swords, branches towering like ten thousand spears," it is not only worthy of scolding, but also as laughable as the butcher Wang selling plum blossoms. The worst thing in inscription is to show off cleverness. I once saw a painter in Shanghai painting fish and inscribing it with "Graceful as a startled swan, sinuous as a swimming dragon." The inscription was quite good, but unfortunately, he added a tail below, saying "Excerpted from the Rhapsody on the Goddess of the Luo River." Such playfulness with small cleverness reveals a sense of self-importance. Those who can appreciate this inscription must have read half of the "Wen Xuan." If you are worried that Wang A-da next door does not know the source, then pointing out the "Rhapsody on the Goddess of the Luo River" to Wang A-da will still not make him know what it is.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingan divides words into upper and lower levels based on their artistic conception and advocates the separation and non-separation theories, which are also very suitable for discussing inscription. The former distinguishes between clarity and turbidity, and the latter between relevance and irrelevance. I once read an inscription on "Tender Bamboo Shoots":</p>
<p>"Tasting the [unclear character] by the stone, mouth low, admiring the verdant peaks under the moon."</p>
<p>The [unclear character] has become a dead bamboo, and the association of Wang Yan’s egrets with three-inch verdant hairpins is unthinkable. The character is low, like Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi, clutching her chest and becoming even uglier. If:</p>
<p>"Houses, smoke trees, sails falling into the empty river."</p>
<p>"A curtain of sparse rain invades the green steps, and several leaves of spring breeze blow through the fingers."</p>
<p>One can know its type without seeing the painting, and its quality is high. The former is landscape painting, and the latter is orchid and bamboo painting. The latter couplet, although somewhat mundane, is still a good work because it is relevant. Rain sets off the sound of bamboo, and the wind clouds smell of incense. The inscription and the painting are closely related, which means they are not separated.</p>
<p>I attended a banquet at the Youth Association and saw an art exhibition that was vulgar and unbearable. Among them, the copying of Wang Shi and Yun Nantian was like a child learning calligraphy. The inscription was "Famous Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition," which was self-deceiving. The most important thing in Chinese painting is the use of ink. If it is stagnant and unrefined, how can it become a family? No wonder those who are slightly fastidious rarely attract customers with art exhibitions throughout their lives.</p>
<p>I wrote this article because I believe that painters should not focus on being shocking. If they have enough ink in their chests, their works will naturally be extraordinary. Otherwise, the difference between a painter and a craftsman cannot be explained.</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Recent Hundred Years of Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xie Zhiliu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office will hold an exhibition of calligraphy and painting from the recent hundred years. The period of one hundred years is from the first year of Xianfeng in the late Qing Dynasty to the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China. Many people know the calligraphers and painters of these ninety-seven years in the Republic of China. Even in the late Qing Dynasty, many elderly people today are old acquaintances. Therefore, this exhibition will give people in society an exceptionally intimate impression.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the calligraphy and painting of the Qing Dynasty were dominated by the Four Wangs and Yun. It seems that there was no calligraphy and painting other than them. But in fact, the Four Wangs and Yun did dominate this era, and no one could surpass their achievements. The sixty-one years of the late Qing Dynasty were not a period of development.</p>
<p>However, in the recent hundred years, there were indeed many intelligent and talented people, as well as loyal officials, filial sons, hermits, and monks, who were also able to occupy a place in calligraphy and painting. The so-called literati painting of the Yuan Dynasty became more and more popular later. In addition to pure calligraphers and painters, those who engaged in calligraphy and painting as a game and sustenance occupied other positions mentioned above. If we talk about purely old paintings, there will of course be other explanations. But from the perspective of cultural relics and history, we should not obliterate them all in the same way. Originally, even if we talk about calligraphy and painting of the Qing Dynasty, there are questionable points, not to mention these recent hundred years, which are not a period of development.</p>
<p>This exhibition will evoke feelings of grief for the deceased and nostalgia, will enable people to obtain evidence for criticizing this period, and will lead people to engage in the path of sorting things out. This is just the beginning. This beginning will not only make people admire and feel sad about these works. Strict and upright criticism should be the greatest significance and harvest of this exhibition.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk on Waving Fans</h3>
<p>— Dingshan</p>
<p>The joy of painting on fans is unmatched by golden surfaces, which have a unique Wang Xie family style. But don't wipe it with powder, but gently wipe it with a fine cloth, so as not to hurt the golden surface. Otherwise, the ink will be dull and the brilliance will be completely lost.</p>
<p>Golden-faced fans are the most fun to play with. There were many golden faces in the Ming Dynasty, and I once gathered up to a hundred of them, but they were lost during the war. In recent years, I like to collect the Four Wangs and Yun, but there is a difficulty, because Yan Ke and Lian Zhou have many golden faces, and Lu He and Shi Gu Nantian have many white faces, but the fan surface of Mo Jing can be said to be unique, let alone gold and white.</p>
<p>I once spent three years to get a page of color-painted white fan surface by Yan Ke and Lian Zhou. Yan Ke made a lakeside spring scene, with weeping willows and peach blossoms, which is unparalleled in its ancient beauty. Lian Zhou made a page of color entirely in the style of Xiangguang, all of which were collaborative works. After seeking for three years, Mo Jing only got a page of bamboo and stone. There is a page in Jiang Shi's Miyun Lou, which is also a few strokes of slender bamboo. There is a page in Tieqin Tongjian Lou, which was made in his early years. Hu Fan Collection contains a page, which is landscape painting. The fan surface of Mo Jing that I have seen in my life can be said to be extremely rare.</p>
<p>The fans of the Ming Dynasty were all red gold faces, while the early Qing Dynasty used green gold, and by the Kangxi Dynasty, they all used white fans. Therefore, it is more difficult to collect white fan surfaces of the Four Wangs, Yan Ke, and Lian Zhou. If you collect golden faces, Lu Tai and Shi Gu are also not easy to find. All of them were made before the age of forty, without the writing of the elderly.</p>
<p>It is not suitable to make large trunks and thick leaves when painting bamboo on fan sections. Wen Shan and Nantian often make green bamboos, which are especially elegant. Because the tight head enters and exits the sleeves, if you hide a boat and carry a mountain, it will make people feel sweaty, and you can take great strength.</p>
<p>Landscape painting on fans should be ink painting, not green and green; it should be in the distance, not in the fortress. It must make the viewer feel far away, between the casual and wonderful products.</p>
<p>Although the painting of silk fans by Song Dynasty artists, such as Guo Xi and Hui Chong, are all small scenes of rivers and sky, they do not let Ma Yaofu and Xia Yuyu surpass them.</p>
<p>It is difficult to paint bamboo with few strokes, because it lies in the branching, not in the leaves. Zhonggui painted bamboo like this a lot. I once saw a picture collected by Zhang Congyu, which was only thirty-seven strokes, and it did not feel less. Xia Taichang's numerous branches and leaves, although many, are useless.</p>
<p>There has never been an expert in lotus painting, but Tang Jie and Yun Nantian both have excellent works. Pang Lai Old Collection contains a huge album of Yun Tianweng, which contains a painting of lotus flowers in color. The flowers are made of cinnabar and powder, and the leaves are made of turquoise and green. They are as gorgeous as the beauties of the pre-Qin period, not the costumes of the times. It is not appropriate to use heavy colors when painting fans. Lotus painting is unique in being able to be gorgeous without being vulgar. Liu Tuntian's words: "Strange flowers and herbs are deep red."</p>
<p>Recently, I have avoided living on the lake. Every morning, I row a small boat and carry red and green into the depths of the lotus flowers to take pictures of the flowers. The collectors of the fans greet me across the water in front of Su Xiao's tomb. When the painting is finished, they give it to me. Water chestnuts, lotus roots, melons, and fruits can all be exchanged, so there is no need to sell peonies in Luoyang for a thousand gold.</p>
<p>The fan bones are best made of water-grinding bamboo without carving. Xiang Fei is already vulgar, and sandalwood is a market. The husband by the sea often abandons them and takes this, waving it in the cities of the five capitals. Although there are good works, I have no way to see them.</p>
<h3>Lin Xinchuan Fan Surface Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Qian Juntao</p>
<p>Our art world can be divided into two major camps. The first camp is Chinese painting, and the second camp is Western painting. Western painting was very prosperous twenty years ago. Now, due to environmental reasons, it seems to have gradually declined, not as lively as it was twenty years ago. On the other hand, Chinese painting has always been lively and has not declined until now. But comparing today to the past, its "quality" seems to be much worse.</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions to the above-mentioned "quality" situation. In terms of Chinese painting, there are also outstanding talents in recent times. For example, Zhang Daqian's landscapes and Qi Baishi's flowers are exceptions. As for the rising group of young painters, there is one named Lin Xinchuan, whom we know well and who has a very promising future. He has a unique painting talent. I have seen the flower fan surface he made, and I think his brushstrokes are exceptionally vigorous and vigorous, the colors are simple and elegant, and the composition is precarious and novel. Roughly, the strengths of Xinluo, Qing Teng, Bai Yang, as well as Hui Shu, Qianlu, and Baishi have been absorbed by him, and these strengths can be melted into his own path to form a style, so he has his own unique picture. The hundreds of works displayed in front of us all radiate his fresh and magnificent charm. This exhibition is very appropriate as a milestone. If he works hard in the current situation until middle age, I think it will not be difficult to become a master. As for the inscription and the arrangement of the seals, I think some pieces can still be considered, so as not to fall into the clichés of predecessors, but this layer is still a small flaw, not worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 359</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Cough... Aunt Ji?" Little Tiger whispered, almost inaudibly; afraid that Yaoqun was not yet awake and would be awakened by him.</p>
<p>"Hmm...? Yaoqun's voice was a little hoarse; it was because he woke up suddenly from a deep sleep: "Brother Tiger?" Immediately after hearing the rustling sound of the grass, Yaoqun had already walked out of the [unclear character].</p>
<p>"Yes!" Yaoqun saw me sitting there and was so surprised that he couldn't recognize me; "Mr. Yu...! Have you been here for a while? Really, why didn't you say something?" This last sentence was said to Little Tiger...</p>
<p>I think whoever saw [unclear character] at this time would not admit that she was the beautiful young lady who was active in the Beiping and Shantou areas ten days ago. At first, she was wearing a cheongsam and leather shoes, needless to say, whether she was dressed in casual clothes, emergency clothes, or non-Chinese and non-Western men's clothes, although she also put some paint on her face, she still had the charming and graceful posture of a young girl. At this time, she had completely changed her appearance. Even if I met her on the road, I would never recognize her.</p>
<p>The cleverness of her makeover is to completely eliminate the contours of the female figure; however, it doesn't look like [unclear character] makeup, which appears swollen and artificial. In this hot weather, it is probably impossible to do. Her eyes, lips, mouth, and nose, although not showing any signs of transformation, seemed to have been moved; the parts, size, height, and position were all different from the original. The skin also became rough and dry. The original neat and white teeth, when she opened her mouth and smiled at this time, seemed like she had never used a toothbrush in the countryside; the yellow was also inlaid with black stripes, and there seemed to be some broken places.</p>
<p>I certainly admit that her makeup skills are superb; because this is not stage makeup, which only needs to be covered up temporarily under the lights to be considered successful. Nor is it like Sherlock Holmes described in detective novels, who uses some wigs and fake beards to blind people temporarily. She is doing this for a long time, and she is also in the midst of a group of Japanese military agents, each of whom has a set of makeup skills and a pair of eyes that can see through disguise.</p>
<p>But Yaoqun did not admit that this makeover was skillful. She said that when she followed her master to practice, she had to transform herself into another original living person, and that was true skill: "For example, Pingzi, or the pseudo-Commander Jin, as long as I had seen them once, I should be able to transform into them exactly the same, even their words and smiles would be indistinguishable from the real ones, that would be considered makeup."</p>
<p>All in all, the crude young man in front of her, wearing an out-of-place military uniform, could not admit that she was Yaoqun's disguise, but could only say that she was another person.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu, I'm really bored," Yaoqun told me as soon as she opened her mouth. "After meeting Captain Shen, the time was too short, and he couldn't explain clearly. I couldn't hear any news from the general team, it was completely isolated... I earnestly ask you to tell me something, and I will report to you the experiences of the past few days - in short, I am a little [unclear character]... [unclear character]!"</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer's Mission</h3>
<p>— Sea Breeze</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer, as a special envoy of President Truman, arrived in Nanjing on the 22nd. Besides the officially announced investigation into the actual situations in China and Korea, whether Special Envoy Wedemeyer has other missions remains difficult to speculate at this time.</p>
<p>However, one point that all parties have affirmed is that Wedemeyer's mission is vastly different from Marshall's. Marshall was ordered to "execute" peace talks, while Wedemeyer is collecting data for the US to reference in future policy decisions regarding China.</p>
<p>Before Wedemeyer's arrival, there were widespread rumors that he was carrying an aid plan for China, including both military and economic aspects. However, Marshall has officially denied this.</p>
<p>But the China issue can no longer be separated from world issues. When Marshall's aid plan for Europe was being highly touted, Wedemeyer's China-Korea investigation team was inseparable from the aid plan for Europe.</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Associated Press in Nanjing on the 23rd pointed this out.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer's trip is undeniably a major turning point for China's future revival. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th stated:</p>
<p>"Chairman Chiang's actions in recent days will have a significant impact on America's future position in China."</p>
<p>In other words, Special Envoy Wedemeyer's recent investigation in China will have a significant impact on China's future position.</p>
<p>To this end, the Chinese government has collected relevant documents and submitted them to Wedemeyer, including the following prominent points:</p>
<p>(1) Sino-Soviet relations—including the Beitashan and Lushun-Dalian issues.</p>
<p>(2) Economic aspects—economic reform plans and all construction and revival plans.</p>
<p>(3) Political aspects—explaining the necessity of general mobilization and the implementation plan for constitutional government. (In military terms, there will be more detailed explanations.)</p>
<p>Wedemeyer's stay in China is four weeks. If divided into groups to investigate the valley areas, it is indeed too short.</p>
<p>We hope that Wedemeyer's trip can obtain sufficient information and materials, and can practically assist China's current situation, which is now of utmost urgency.</p>

<h3>Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Ming Sen</p>
<p>When a man and a woman get married, they must live together cooperatively. Even in the most ideal union, there are always some initial conflicts—in desires, attitudes, and interests. Resolving these conflicts is essential for a happy married life. If the conflicts continue unresolved, the man may seek another partner or solace, while the woman, if she does not want a divorce, will resort to "nagging" as a means of resolution.</p>
<p>Upon closer analysis, the root causes of nagging women are no more than the following four:</p>
<p>(1) Imbalance in sexual relations—According to Dr. Robert Latou Dickinson in his book "A Thousand Marriages: A Medical Study of Sexual Adjustment," complete marital unity depends on the unity of sexual relations. Dr. Paul Popenoe in "The Conservation of the Family," as well as Han Ninguerden and McGu Wen in their co-authored "What's Wrong with Marriage," all indicate that sexual imbalance is the root cause of discord in most couples.</p>
<p>Many women have no knowledge of sexuality when they marry, and they never surpass their initial experiences. Ordinary women who cannot get enough love and attentive care from their husbands are almost certain to become nagging wives. She often refuses to acknowledge sexual imbalance as the main cause of her dissatisfaction, but instead grumbles and complains about his "eating habits," his bad attitude, and so on.</p>
<p>Isabel can serve as a good example: she initially fell in love with a young violinist, but he refused to marry her for the sake of his own future; later, she married an older, prosperous garment manufacturer.</p>
<p>As soon as her new family was established, she immediately developed a kind of "cleanliness obsession." She spent all day cleaning and scrubbing everything in her house. She would not allow her husband to lie on any couch unless he first covered it with a protective cloth. She constantly watched visiting guests, fearing they would flick cigarette ash on the floor. After eleven years, her husband finally left—never to return.</p>
<p>The cause was entirely the imbalance in sexual relations. Isabel's husband was not like the violinist, not a "sophisticated" man; his attitude was very crude. For Isabel, the sexual experience with her husband was "vulgar" and "unclean." During those eleven years of marriage, she never had a proper love life—she nagged endlessly, constantly vigilant, and kept her house extremely clean as compensation.</p>
<p>(2) Romantic Dreams—In general, movies, popular novels, and popular songs give young women a deep romantic concept of love. According to E. D. Maurer in "The Ruin of the Family," "This romantic view of marriage has become a focal point of marital discord."</p>
<p>Walter Lippmann put it well in "A Preface to Morals": "A couple in love who do nothing but love each other are not really worth admiring; love without any attachments will soon become nothing. A couple in love not only love each other but also love many things together—such love will last. Apart from the other serious things in life, love is unlikely to bear fruit."</p>
<p>A woman who insists on romantic notions is always comparing her husband to the "ideal lover" she reads about in novels or sees in movies. Unfortunately, this happiness can only last until the day she proposes or gets married. When her own marital dream loses its rosy luster, she will be greatly disappointed, feel cheated, and unhesitatingly resort to nagging. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Collector's Sorrow</p>
<p>Lu Wanquan, a resident of Jiangyin Zhoushan Town, was a butcher. During the Anti-Japanese War, he specialized in collecting various auxiliary coins and banknotes, accumulating them in rice bins, amounting to tons, a wide variety to behold. In recent years, prices have risen repeatedly and the value of currency has plummeted, causing Lu to die of depression. It is reported that the auxiliary coins he hoarded could have been exchanged for at least 1,200 dan of rice at the time.</p>
<p>Old Woman as Ba長</p>
<p>Yin Guantun in Fengrun County, Hebei, has been devastated by war, and all the men have fled. At the beginning of its recovery last year, the county government, finding no one to be responsible for the baojia system, appointed the village's elderly women, Cui Yangshi (65 years old) and He Nanshi (60 years old), as the chief and deputy bao heads, respectively, to handle village affairs. They have been in office for a year and a half and have achieved remarkable results. They are very adept at dealing with various agencies, and they are particularly diligent in collecting grain and taxes. However, both elderly women are illiterate. According to the two women themselves, their method of recording grain and tax collection is as follows: for every dou of grain collected, they draw a "+" on the paper; for half a dou, they draw a crescent moon; for every 10,000 yuan in taxes, they draw a small circle, and they have never made a mistake.</p>
<p>Such a Bureau Chief</p>
<p>Cai Bochao, the chief of the Police Bureau in She County, Anhui, has currently tied up the bureau's section chief, Zhu, and sent him to the county government for legal action. The reason for the arrest is that Zhu was "secretly working as a reporter for a certain newspaper in Tunxi." After interrogation, the county government considered that "working as a newspaper reporter is not a crime" and refused to accept the case. Zhu is now appealing to Cai for "infringement of freedom."</p>
<p>Also a Solution</p>
<p>The Qingdao New Transport Promotion Association, in order to improve the city's appearance and maintain cleanliness, stipulates that all households along the street must clean the streets in front of their doors from 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM every morning, or face penalties. It is also stipulated that anyone who spits on the road at any time will be fined or sentenced to hard labor and must also scrub the sputum clean.</p>

<h3>Chen Yanyan in a Scene from "Dragon and Phoenix Bracelets"</h3>
<h3>A Record of New York City</h3>
<p>— Pu Lun</p>
<p>—The second largest city in the world, inhabited by people of seventy-five nationalities</p>
<p>In 1776, New York was still a small city, mostly inhabited by British and Dutch people; but today, New York has become the second largest city in the world. It is inhabited by people of seventy-five different nationalities, speaking all kinds of dialects.</p>
<p>New York City began to be inhabited in 1847, and the population slowly increased. By 1905, it had reached a population of one million, and now, it has exceeded seven million. Like a large boiler, this large city has become a common "denominator," because it does not belong to the English, the Dutch, the Russians, the Germans, or the Irish, but includes every "molecule."</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is that there are more Irish people living in New York City than living in their own capital—Dublin; many of them work in government offices, and they also hold positions in the police force. There are also more Italians in New York than in Rome, a total of 1,095,000 people. They poured into New York City in large numbers between 1900 and 1920 and are the largest group of foreigners in New York City; many of them are homesick and want to return to their homeland.</p>
<p>There are 12,000 Chinese people in New York City, but in reality, it is probably double that number; they are officers who moved in during World War I and mostly live in Chinatown. Only one in ten Chinese women there can get married; this means that the marriage conditions for Chinese men there are very poor. Most of them work in bars or restaurants and are accustomed to nightlife.</p>
<p>There are only 19,000 French people in New York, and they do not have a fixed community, because their organization is scattered. They use bars set up by their compatriots as gathering places. The poverty and chaos of their country have driven them to New York in hopes of some good luck; they are engaged in bars, import and export, cosmetics, and fashion industries, and many French people ultimately hope to return to their homeland.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the Russians in New York came before the Russian Revolution, and there are now 57,000 of them, most of whom have been naturalized as Americans. They rarely call themselves White Russians and mostly dislike communism. They are engaged in construction, and a portion are merchants.</p>
<p>Germans in New York are very organized and often communicate with each other; every week, all German families gather together, wearing their national costumes, speaking their own language, dancing their national dances, and drinking large quantities of beer. Their national consciousness is terribly strong.</p>
<p>The Czechs in New York are somewhat similar to the Germans, they have their own schools, teaching elementary school students about their national folklore, history, songs, and dances of the old country in their native language. These are amateur schools, with the purpose of preventing children from forgetting their own country. They are very enthusiastic about celebrating their national day; they also faithfully and enthusiastically support four newspapers in their native language. Most of them are engaged in commerce.</p>
<p>The 412,000 Poles, who make up eight percent of the total population of New York City, are mostly skilled industrial workers.</p>
<p>There are many wealthy Jews in New York, almost a third of the city's population, and they are skilled workers in the city's garment industry. These Jews without a homeland are very united, and the many people's organizations they have organized are unmatched by any country. This is because their shared cultural heritage and ancient national customs give them a sense of community. Many older Jews still piously believe in Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Greeks are mostly cooks in New York because they can make delicious food. There are 53,000 Greeks there. There are 11,000 Yugoslavs in New York, many of whom believe in communism, and they have portraits of Stalin and Tito hanging in their homes.</p>
<p>There are 123,000 Hungarians in New York, mostly engaged in commerce.</p>
<p>Other Norwegians number 54,000, and they occupy an important position in the business world. There are 11,000 Dutch people, and they were the first to come to New York City. The fewest are Indians, only 150.</p>
<p>The above is the general situation of the people of some important countries in New York City.</p>
<h3>Film Scene This Week</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>"The Chase"—A Good Play Worth Recommending</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, after "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," this is a good play that confronts reality and reflects reality. I would like to recommend it to every audience member who loves domestic films.</p>
<p>In this film, you can see the social microcosm of suffering China. The Anti-Japanese War has been won, but those who made fortunes from the national crisis and the victory are even more reckless. On the other hand, those national industrialists who are struggling hard are struggling in the wind and rain. The fate of the factory is precarious. Even the national industrialist Fang Zijiu has been forced into paralysis. It is still a microcosm of the suffering fate encountered by those Chinese industrialists.</p>
<p>The director's handling of the whole film is extremely sharp, and it is obviously a further step beyond "Record of the Holy City."</p>
<p>Although Huang Jiaying is on the screen for the first time, she is extremely capable of grasping the kind and innocent character of Dao. Wei Heling, Zhou Feng, and Han Tao have all achieved considerable success. Huang Jijiang's simple acting skills prove that he will have excellent achievements in film as well as on stage.</p>
<p>The cinematography and sound recording are both above average, but the set design is poor.</p>
<p>Sad "Dragon and Phoenix Bracelets"</p>
<p>This is adapted from a love story "Yu Li Gui" from the Mandarin Duck Butterfly School. Although it has a theme of opposing feudalism and anti-rites, the characters in the play all lack "ripeness" and "power," so what they leave behind is just some tear-jerking stories, sad and weak emotions.</p>
<p>The story is arranged to be quite lingering and sympathetic, grieving for several people, but Tu Guangqi's directing skills are poor, and many scenes lack poetic and artistic charm and are made quite vulgar. The descriptions of Zhou Bingwen and Fang Li's life after marriage are also rather rigid in the process.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Chen Yanyan has the best performance, especially in the second half, which is very impressive. Feng Zhe plays two roles, but his performance is mediocre. In comparison, Xu Daping is better than Zhou Bingwen.</p>
<p>Detective Film "Tears of Red"</p>
<p>"Tears of Red" is Betty Grable's change of style work. The story is a general American popular novel, from the murder of a woman to the solving of the case. The only thing commendable about this play is the writing skills of the screenwriter, which are still relatively witty and pleasing.</p>
<p>Betty Grable's performance as Qi'er is stable and that's it.</p>
<p>Wu Qing's "Double Heroes Blood"</p>
<p>A gambling den leader and a female student fall in love inexplicably. The story unfolds from here. What's especially boring is that the gambling den leader is also a veteran who specializes in "talking about love" with women, but in the script, he is described as so sacred. This is really the whimsical idea of that old film and drama writer.</p>
<p>If I don't tell you that this is a film directed by the famous director Mervyn LeRoy, you simply wouldn't believe that his work would be so mediocre.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>The slapstick film "Muddleheaded Hero," which imitates Harpo Marx's acting skills, is completely nonsensical, and "Swordsman Errant" is also much inferior to the previous film.</p>
