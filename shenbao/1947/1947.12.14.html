<h3>立院辯論郵電加價　呈請國府停止執行　各委慷慨力爭法治精神</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕郵電未經立院完成立法程序，遽行調整，是否合法問題，爲十三日晨立院三四二次例會最激烈之議題，各立委發言踴躍而激昂，多數主張停止加價，後由政院副院長王雲五代表張院長蒞院說明，交部郵電司長陶鳳山亦列席以備諮詢，經三小時辯論後，最後決議，呈請國民政府令主管機關將十一月十日發布郵常調整命令停止執行，並令行政院將該案送立院審議。</p>
<p>今日會議因孫院長出席中常會，由法制委會委長劉克儁代理主席，議程開始徠，王毓祥即首起資難，對主管當局此次不顧立法院建議，對郵電遽行加價，表示不滿，各立委紛起發言，陳顧遠憤然指出，張院長就任時曾表示尊重立法權，而政院此次行動即在宋子文內閣時代亦所未有，顯爲政院忽視立院之表示，認今日立院已成強弩之末，乃有此迫不及待之行動，殊不知將被人批評爲違法。鄧鴻業亦認張院長就職不滿一年，竟做出歷來行政院長向未做過之事，與其尊重立法權之言論完全違背，應請院說明。陳紫楓更激烈，建議將此案送交監察院。譚惕吾認法治精神非力爭不可，站在法律立塲，任何人皆不應有違法行動，主張根據法律宣布此次命令無效，並附議請張院長來院說明。上沭動議經全院同意，乃由樓秘書長電請張院長來院。</p>
<p>十時三刻許，王副院長雲五代表張院長來院，說明政院此次措施經過，指出郵電將損過鉅，增加國庫負擔，為欲自給自足，當須經常調整，若每次調整皆經過立法程序，未免麻煩，乃援過去銀行法公布時，其中關於停閉銀行須經司法手續一條暫緩實行之先例，由政院請國務會議授權，對郵電加價暫予特許作隨時調整，至此次命令，係奉國務會議命令後，由政院飭交部，再由交部轉令各地郵局執行者，由於地區廣大，命令早已發下，此係事實經過，政院張院長絕對尊重法律，並重視立法權，此舉決無其他用意。</p>
<p>王氏說明畢，各委員紛起質詢，陳顧遠指出援引銀行法先例，並不恰切，禍去未完成立法程序先行加價，然後再作補救，亦非無例可援，政院此次草率行動，存心先已不良，難免不有「生於其心，書於其政」之譏，絕不能謂爲遵守法律。王世憲詢問此事辦理急速倉皇，一若急迫之至，是否非如此郵政經濟將不堪設想。建國特捐僅關係少數當人，然一再討論，迄未實行，郵資加價國人普遍負擔，而如此草率執行，實說不通。再者，交部重視開源，對節流是否已盡心力，郵局於各地大興土木，郵務人員待遇優厚，且多冗員，何不從糧節着手。王毓祥謂：旣可以命令變更法律，何不可以命令變更命令。（以國府命令變更十一月十日郵電加價命令）？民主政治即麻煩政治，若嫌立院麻煩，何不將其取消。鍾天心指出此事之重要性，請行政當局注意，目前此種行爲，若在將來行憲後立院發生，立委可請行政院長辭職。</p>
<p>至此，孫九錄提出折衷方案，盼政院立即下令暫行加價若千時期，再交立院謀所以補救。王副院長亦起立說明政院決無半點想違法或不尊重立院之意，並歷沭採此揹施之苦衷。各委員仍不滿意，認人民可照原價寄信，郵局若作欠資論，人民可提出控訴。林彬說明，授權應依據法律，以法律之方式爲之，國務會議不能授權，政院直接向立院提案，前例甚多，政院爲免自增麻煩計，可逕向立院提出。各立委詢問畢，王雲五擬退席，委員中有主應請張院長蒞院者，爭執頗烈，王等於十二時廿分始退席。立委繼續討論，根據林彬建議，作成決議，呈請國民政府令主管機關將十一月十日發布郵資調整命令停止執行，並今行政院將該案送立院密議，會議至十二時半始散。</p>
<h3>立院下午會議通過　管理外匯條例　滿族立監委名額不再增加</h3>
<p>下午二時半繼續開會，通過下列各案：　國務會議決議關於政黨提名補充法規，與本院制定國代選舉罷免法第十二條。立委選舉罷免法第十二條規定之原意相符。按政黨提名補充規定內容爲：1國國民黨。靑年黨。民主社會黨黨員參加國大代表及立法委員競選者，均須由各所屬政黨提名。2用選民等署手續登記提名者，以無黨派者爲限。　交通事業人員任用條例。　中央銀行管理外匯條例。我滿族代表溥　請援照蒙藏成案此例，增加滿族立。監委名額，案照審查意見對該項請求予以同情之考慮，惟監委。立委名額已多，擬不再行增加，可由主管機關作事實上之調劑。　修正監委選舉法規案。照審查意見以監院所請修正監委選舉罷免法第六條關於候選人速署部份業已公布，無庸再議，至於修正同法第七條及其施行條例第二條所定各省市行政首長兼爲選舉監督，以監委執行職務時，每以行政首長爲糾彈對象，爲杜絕流弊，不應以行政首長兼任一節，原則甚表同情，惟本屆各雀市監委選舉監督，業經國府明令派定，目下未便加以變更。最後通過卅四年度，卅五年度追加預算案數起，五時半散會。（央行管理外匯條例全文列二版左角）</p>
<h3>糧部調節盈虛　充裕各地糧食　京滬舉辦糧貸千億元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕糧食部向來對於各地糧食著重盈虛調節，使供需獲得相當平衡，糧價亦可趨於平穩，近以各地糧價上漲，復經促請京滬各主要消　都市疏暢糧源，幷向四行貸款，購儲民糧，以備調節，（南京向四行貸款三百億，購儲民糧設廿萬石，滬向四行貸款七百億，購儲民糧敷米十萬石），復由政院核定糧食流通管理辦法，規定長江各省區糧食應自由流通，以期來源充裕，現各地糧價已較穩定。</p>

<h3>中印民航協定　決展延三個月</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕印大使梅農稱：「中印民用航空協定，茲經中印政府雙方協議，決自十二月十五日有效截止日期起，延長三個月，預期在此期間，印度方面可派遣一民航代表團來華進行談判，重新締結新協定。按中印民航協協定係一九四三年一月締定，爲中國戰時對外民航協定之最早者，在是項協定之下，中印空運及飛行人員，曾作空運道上最車越之供獻。原協定定今年十二月十五日截止，今後之民航協定，則爲中國政府與獨立之印度政府締定。</p>
<h3>外部發言人談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕外部發言人頃發表談話稱：王外長十二日在國務會議席上所報告之種種事實，各報所載互有出入，均不正確，凡國務會議之外交，軍事報告，如未經國務會議正式公布，報端所載，不得視爲準確。</p>
<h3>英答覆中蘇照會　拒絕在華討論對日和約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播，英國對蘇聯建議於明年一月在中國召開對日和約準備會議一節，已明自加以拒絕，並對中。蘇兩國所提太平洋四強應保有否決權之議亦不接受。英政府以照會分致中。蘇兩國，其中力主早日起草對日和約，一切決定因根據三分之二多數表決。英方認為此項會議在華盛頓召開較爲便利，良以遠東各國目下均有專　在華府故也日和約問題，關於否決權問題。英方認為如不能以平等立塲顧及參加各國之利益，反足以遷延和約之早日簽訂。英政府致中國之照會，措詞較爲緩和，但對於中國所是　遠　委員會各會員國參加對日和約準備會議一點，拒不接受，以意度之，英國或擬使緬甸亦能參預此項工作也。</p>
<h3>處理美國救濟物資　我計劃即交美方　三千萬救濟欵不敷分配</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕據悉：政院處理美國救濟物資委會討論中之「利用美救濟物資實施救濟計劃」中，統計全國受天災及匪患之人民總數達四千八百九十萬，內非救濟不活者一千二百萬，赤貧者八百七十萬，現被救濟者五十七萬，共計必須予以救濟者在二千一百萬人。以上三個月所需糧食約九七〇萬噸。依此估計，三千萬美元之救濟款項勢不敷用，此一計劃提交美方代表後，或將促其注意並考慮如何可使美方之救濟援助更爲有效。該項計劃中之工作項目分爲三類：　臨時緊急救濟，　以工代賑，　建設性救濟，包括救濟機構之增加並補充，傷殘救濟院及特別兒童轉導院之設立，並選大都市辦理家庭福利，在京及其他房荒城市建立小規模平民住宅等。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十三日電〕據官方消息：行政院處理美國救濟物資委員會十三日已完成利用救濟物資方案，其副本即將送交司徒雷登大使，轉送華盛頓中國救濟委員會主席。</p>

<h3>在華美軍人員　不准搭京滬車　來往均乘軍用交通機</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕據悉：美在華陸軍人員不准乘搭京滬綫火車，蓋恐捲入共匪游盤隊破壞所引起之任何事件。此舉係因蘇北局勢又形緊張之故。美軍顧問團團長魯克斯少將在南京告合眾社記者稱：美軍人員不許乘搭京滬綫火車，已數日於茲，所有由京赴滬人員，均以軍用交通機載往。</p>
<h3>對日易貨政策　明年繼續實施　中信局正草擬計劃</h3>

<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>從史的立塲觀察新疆（上）——關於重寫新疆史的幾點竟見——</h3>
<p>一.認識新疆，我認為先決條件，是要認淸牠的歷史，至少對於新疆自來的文化及社會演變，要有一個系統化的槪念。我們如願新疆長治久安，就應該信賴客觀知識的功效，從根本上去做溯導流的工作。</p>
<p>因此我希望目前應有一部理想的新疆通史問世，這部通史的哲學觀點必須站在全世界人類進步的和諸關係上，在方法上，必須絕對根據科學；在內容上，更必須將中國和回敎諸國的古典史料及近氏中西學者之硏究心得全部包括在內；祇有這樣客觀地把握歷史經騐，世人纔能够完美無缺地認識新疆，認淸大陸的心像，並使煙沒巳久的大陸文明得以更生，而賦與其所應得的新世界地位。</p>
<p>當然，這種工作極不容易，決非一二人的學識經驗所能勝任。根據現代文明的要求，最好是成立一個國際文化合作機構，專門負責去辦，以便可自複雜的關係中，去從容檢討一切地質學，地理學，人類學，民族學，考古學，語言學，與比較宗敎學的總成績，而後加以通體的綜合，務使新疆史能以不帶絲毫意氣的純科學性質介紹給世人，這是較高的理想。若認為困難，則降而求其次，提早約同一批人到新疆去，先做一些工作，這些人必須要有足够的廉虛，能見此世界之大而曉得自身的限度，願意認淸其理想工作的完成。祗少要孜孜不倦地致力於拓荒的工作，他們的讀者對像，不是世界上的專門學者，而是一般對新疆具有科學觀點及歷史情操的人士，和廣大社會的感應與覺悟；對新疆方面，則儘量多找原始資料，多與土著各民族的學者合作，多請敎人，多學習回敎諸國的語文及文化，以求在球境雜的邊疆社會裏樹立一種負氣，一種客觀精神的基礎，為來日專心致力於此的人開闢一條道路。</p>
<p>中國雖有一個兩棲性的國土，但近百年來來人文薈萃海岸一綫，大多數的國人，祇是「半中國人」，在其文化的潛能上，祇有海洋性的一半，另外大陸性的一半，形成癱瘓，也沒有機會去培養發育，好容易日本戰敗，綿延百載的口岸威脅得以解除，才有回向內陸的機會，今後要在文化上重視內陸，就首須重視全國中最內陸化的新疆；因為祇有新疆，才有那種可以養成一反南朝金粉氣息的大陸天地及氣宇，才會在文化的接觸上，增加想象不到的生機和血液，而恢復那久已癱瘓的半個中國人。也祇有新疆是中國與世界之間之唯一橋梁，我們要生存在這個世界上，就必須從這個橋梁走到世界上去，今後中國在一個長時期內，在政治經濟社會上，要跟人家學步，有志者，必更企望在學術文化上，能有自發自啓的文化精神表現，能有俯仰無愧的為人及立國之道，能有我們自己的世界觀，及對於世界秩序的看法，因此我又覺得從事新疆史之價値，有非筆　所能形容者。</p>
<p>新疆問題之命根應寄托於歷史，而論史則須基於今日之時代精神，今日登高四望，遠之則　　虎視，國步艱難；近之則兄弟　牆，哀鴻遍野，好像沒有多大希望，但是時代指針所示的意養則並不如是。在歷史進各的遠方，仍有良辰美景可尋，但視吾人是否具有決心求達彼岸而定。由此論史便成為鬬爭，要從奮鬥中尋求光明的途徑，要從各種小天下的狹窄網羅中衝出去，走向康莊的大道，要從新疆這一基點出發，四面八方去樹立我們世界精神和文化信念；苟能作如是觀，如是幹，則新疆史的再硏究工作，就不僅有其時代的意義，而且成為必要了。</p>
<p>基於這種時代鼓勵，我想提供幾點重新整理新疆史的意見：</p>
<p>新疆文明為世界文明的一環，決不能孤立發而必須接受外的影響。故要批判任何牽涉到新疆的史觀，都必須透過整個世界文明的影響而不可專憑一種文明的角度去看。</p>
<p>新疆的現存史料，更多半是新疆外　各文明集團之觀念及利益的產物，都是一時一地的片斷印象，夜郞自大，多不可靠，事過境遷，更無價値，故在整理史料時，必須非常客觀地淸除其主觀性，揭發其殘缺性。</p>
<p>根據比較硏究的結論定出一個綜合性的網領來，然後把經過洗　的資料各置於其所應置的地位。</p>
<p>二.新疆文明的四個階段</p>
<p>目前世界上有四條解決新疆史的道路，分別指向中國·回敎諸國·西洋·蘇聯四個方向，我們祇要着手硏究新疆歷史，就無法避免不與此種已成傳統性的觀點碰頭，更容易不自覺而受其影響，所以必須堅定立塲，確立態度，在心理上不泥古，不盲從，才不會跌進這些小天下的網羅。勇敢地站到世界文明進化之總立塲去展開廣大的視野，我們不但要自此凌空的，俯識的角度去觀察新疆歷史，而且要以這凌空的，俯職的客觀態度去觀察中國·回敎諸國·西方·及蘇聯的歷史，我們我們祇有竭其所能地守住此一超然的崗位，才可能發現那些現象是有助於策這體的進步，那些現象是妨害通體進化的反動，和如何才是世界整體的福利，而知有所適從。</p>
<p>在世界文明的光還限於江河內海之濱的時候，新疆文明亦與其他各處相繼出現的光芒一樣，範團很小，大　祇凝集在塔里木河沿岸，這時因為各方文明彼此多無往來接觸的機會，故各自發展而成不同樣式的孤立文明，今天世界還保留着的許多古舊傳與習慣，就都是在那時形成的，以後便沒有這種與世無爭的環境了。</p>
<p>江河內海文而發廢到高峯，各種孤立文明，紛紛出穴，開疆拓土而成面，鐵兵和戰馬形成新疆被包園的大勢，東面的兩漢文明，西面之中東各大帝國及希臘羅馬文明，南面的摩揭陀貴霜笈多帝國文明，北面的　奴鮮卑柔然　遊牧帝國文明，均以新疆堡壘為逐鹿之塲。在文化交流的急　渦中，東面的司馬遷和西面的希羅多德，首先發起歷史寫作，兩位歷史之父，各就不同的角度觀察新疆，「西域」與「伊　山外的塞國」之定名，初步形成了新疆最基本的古典史料，新疆亦由此而在世界文明中開始佔有地位。</p>
<p>在這個階段，新疆在文化上，承受波斯希臘之餘緒，在政治上則採牽漢之形式，具有戰國遊俠刺客風尙的漢人創立了很大的事業，段會宗在北疆，班超在南疆的工作，是綠洲與草原兩種政制的典型，因為這些漢人都有很高的組織能力，故新疆的國際武裝和平，亦得到最長久的紀錄。</p>
<p>遊收民族從北徼荒遠的草原上大量湧出，以後浪逐前浪的形態，關開大陸交通，世界文明由戰馬的速率，擴成帶狀，大批的駝馬，紛自裏海北岸的低地，海拉特門，和鐵關侵入東歐中東和印度，佛敎和基督敎分頭向東西旅行，新疆在貴霜朝的控制下，成為佛敎國際之一環，在空前的泛神藝術繁榮下，隋唐帝國和大食帝國的學者繼續書寫歷史，從司馬遷和希羅多德前對抗，到司馬光和塔巴里Tabari（大食史家）的對抗，隋唐人以河西為根據地，向西展望；阿刺伯人以呼羅珊（Khorassan）為基點，向東展望；加上拓跋族及東羅馬史家對於北原牧民的展望，新疆古典史料，極絢爛凌亂之致。</p>
<p>大陸時期的長期繁榮和古代各種孤立文明的古典傳統，根深蒂固地構成了舊世界人類對新疆的不同觀感，及習慣的成見與錯覺，退向長江流域的漢族在心目中仍不願放棄其盛世的觀念，和一些基於漢唐傳統而發生的英雄主義，傳奇精神及封建帝國主義性的手法，他們的態度是一種向大陸方面擴張的態度，其史觀是大陸國防的史觀，但事實上則以退縮東南日久，其知識份子對於大陸時期曾在新疆發生過的重大事故，如黑汗國，察合台汗國，鐵木爾王朝的文物制度等，已陷於完全不能明瞭的地步，另一方面則自蓋古帝國以後，諸回敎國史家的落後心理，亦始終迷戀着大回敎國際的理想，以為祇有中東中亞才是文明樂土，而發揮其小天下的孤立主義，把世界其他區的異敎徒異文化永遠視作宗敎及民族鬥爭的對象，可是世界史的大陸階殿已入尾聲，遠方看不見的哥倫布已經上陸於新大陸了。這是當時脫節的悲劇，歷史的諷喩。</p>
<p>十九世紀是大洋時代是高峯，這時中國更被逼而不得不以背向大陸面對大洋的姿勢救生存，印度和回敎諸國亦走上不走資本主養途徑便要淪為殖民地的命運，但他們的形體縱有變化，他們的觀念却依然不曾有何改變，他們已經遠地落在世界文明的背後，却遠要憑藉過去的光榮餘烈來要求其歷史權利，當中國左宗棠西進時，土爾其的阿不都哈密德蘇丹Soltan　Abdol　Hamid發動其泛伊斯蘭運動時，他們都仍是站在不同的平面角度去看新疆，並且充滿誇大狂與　他性的心理，這是今日新疆許多不率　端的對立遠因。</p>
<p>因此，我們在技術上必須澈底檢查潛伏在此四種史觀中的理念，是否尙含有江河內海，大陸，及大洋時期之各種成見，並估計這些殘餘的成見是否尙能引起文化及社會上的不良影響；然後再從反面去檢查在今日的新疆社會中尙在有多少主觀傳統的因素，我們必須無畏地去發覺牠，揭露牠，說服牠，去促成純客觀的新疆歷史槪念之提早成熟與建立，及其先濯條件科學精神之喚起與勝利，去盡一份拓荒的努力。</p>
<p>在中國的古典史料裏面，要檢查牠那些不負責的英雄主義，傳廳精神，及封建商國主義性的因棄，如西域觀念的傳統，班超主義，左宗棠主義等。因為我們估計這些觀念之存在，對於眞正促成中國人民的精誠團結並不會有何帮助，故必須加以剔棄。</p>
<p>在回敎國家的古典史料裏面，要檢查出那些宗敎狂及狹議民族主義學誇大狂與排他性來，如在整個世界進化上已經落伍的泛伊斯蘭主義，泛土耳其主義等，因為這些思想對於眞正促成新疆人民的自由幸福解放實無益處可言，有之亦徒足以招致極端的脫節與頑固。</p>
<p>在西方諸國的史料方面，要能够精密地辦別出某些基於科學僞證而流行的意見，為及其中於忽視其他文明價値所形成的愚昧論斷，如以西方為世界文明之母的優越感，如認為新疆文明之基礎，亦必屬亞利安文明，希臘文明的粗忽結論之類，因為這種具有科學僞證的言論，其影響之深，實有甚於缺乏科學訓絲之說敎，對於思辨及稽古的繼續發展亦有害處，故必須予以注意。</p>
<p>在蘇聯的史料方面，也要一方吸收其較新的科學成績，一方則注意其巧妙的宣傳技術，這是因為蘇聯的史觀不僅具有絕對「一元論」的特性，並且正在以其獨斷的精神，在進行支配其他思想之故，牠雖有無所不包的內容，却沒有尊重其他文明的雅量，在此新的歷史動力之前，不但其他有價値的不同觀念要被消滅，即善良的客觀精神，亦將不容存在。我們雖極願接受蘇聯在思想上之一切有價値的科學貢獻，却祇能以之作為現代思想主流之一而與之合作，而不能以之為現代思想之全體而受其支配，也不能承認蘇聯的看法是一種客觀的看法，這就是我們對蘇聯史料運用上的限度。同時在本質上，我們更不得不承認蘇聯史觀的主觀性，實與中國及回敎諸國古典史料的主觀性，初無二致。（未完）</p>
<h3>對日易貨政策</h3>
<p>（上接一版）按日本為職敗國家，在佔領期間其政府與人民不得自由與他國貿易，所有日元亦不應有國際匯率，但其產品有為各戰勝國所急需者，故管制當局遂決定以易貨記賬方式，由駐日盟軍總部與各國政府經營管制當局，規定此項日本易貨政策，係各國同　辦理。各國政府國處於戰勝之地位，無不光向日本取貨，然後陸續以貨淸付，其取得態速，償付愈緩者，愈為有利益，唯戰勝國始能透支。我國因屬近隣，運輸較易，故輸入數額亦較多，如開鑛用之　木現已運入六，一九〇，五一八根，鐵路用之枕本已達五七九，一六五根，炸　八，二八三箱，戰後最應恐慌之煤電供應，迄今尙未發生大問題者，泰半基於此項易貨之進行，故行政院此項決策對於經濟復員　益甚鉅，蓋爭取物資愈運對於主張　員亦愈有利。同時因貨運關係，入超出超時有變動。以最近情形　，共欠盟部美金價款約數百萬美元，其原因為：　我國　取物資迅速，　過去一年中餘　運出减少，如按照原定數量運出不僅可免入超且必能增加工　器付之輸入量，最近資姿委會　將海南島鐵砂實與中信局運往日本，就易貨本岙而言，日本所乏原料倘不再　　住則　國所需之銅鐵成品，如火車頭，鐵軌等均不得再有輸入。同時此項鐵砂運出，中信局可向盟軍總部交涉，到少可以半數歸由我國船隻裝運，更將有利於我國航運事業。至中信局供應資委會之器材業已交貨者，約値美金五十一萬元，業已訂約尙未交貨者，約値美金五十六萬元，共計美金一百十七萬元。此項易貨，明年仍將照當進行。鹽政總局，亦將在可能範團內供應較多之餘鹽。</p>

<h3>對西方國家對德政策蘇外長猛　施抨擊雙方劍拔弩張情勢緊張外長會延期至明日再開</h3>
<p>「本報訊」倫敦十三日廣播：山於星期五晚上之激烈爭執，預定於今日舉行之四外長會議，暫定延期至下星期一舉行，藉以和緩空氣。美代表團某團員稱，如今日繼續舉行會議，勢將引起混亂之塲面。兩日之休息可予四國外長對今後行動作審愼之考慮。權威方而人士謂，關於德國賠償問題，業已陷入無法解決之僵局，　賠償問題不獲解決，則其他經濟　問題均無從討論。在本週末，馬歇爾對於是否繼續外長會一點，勢將有所決定，一切胥視　洛托夫於下星期一開會時所採取之態度而定。據悉，莫氏願意使會議繼續進行，蘇方某發言人曾謂會議前　　於馬歇爾之態度云。</p>
<p>「路透社倫敦十二日電」今日之外長會議又轉入方相指　之階段。莫洛托夫指責西方盟國不經德國同意，强迫其接受援助，不啻代拆代行，其用意在抨擊馬歇爾方案。今日之會大部份時間均爲莫洛托夫就賠償問題所發表之長篇演辭所佔，事後貝文表示：「吾人如此遭受侮辱，整個英共和邦人民均將發生反感。」皮杜爾亦曰　，莫洛托夫之　與事實完全相反。馬歇爾則曰，就本會目的及與會代表在政府中所佔之地位觀，使人感覺此等程序方法，將難以令人產生對蘇聯政府之尊敬。莫洛托夫關於賠償問題之聲明，具有下列諸項指責：　三西方國家代表團反對蘇賠償，是與雅爾達及波茨坦之態度相悖；　德西部之生產，已陷入窒息狀態，西方國家之壓制德工業，意在使輸入品湧入德國；　德西部烘斤木材及類似物產之輸出，使外國銀行家及企業家經手時獲利不少；　由於輸入品之湧入西部佔領區，使德國負債累累，聞德國對美負債六億美元，對英負債七億美元，卒使德工業不得不倚賴外資；　西方國家利用德西部作爲向德國內外施用政治壓力之基地，及反民主國之戰略基地。</p>
<p>今日開會之初，首先討論蘇聯建議之廢止德境英美區之經濟合併協定。莫洛托夫謂德西部三佔領區已有政治及經濟合併之計劃，法國對於此事亦表同意，渠並曰，德國分裂愈益加深，已趨向建立統一德國之絕望。馬歇爾聞言立即否認西部三區已有合併計劃之存在，並曰英美區之經濟合併，原屬暫時措施，以待整個德經濟之統一，且英美政府已一再表示準備擴大此等合併制度至於他區，以究成德全國經濟之統一。馬歇爾並聲明英美區之合併乃自衛措施，以防正當英美資助德西部之際，而蘇聯方急於移運德國東部之經濟資源。</p>
<h3>英外相宣示　願促進國際諒解</h3>
<p>「聯合社倫敦十三日電」英外相貝文昨夜亦在基督敎英美邦交促進會發表演說，響應美國務卿馬歇爾。貝文稱，「吾人之友誼並不排除他人，全世界凡屬人類，無不竭忱與之親善。吾英美人能彼此諒解，更望全世界均能諒解。」其時法外長皮杜爾亦在座，惟蘇外長莫洛托夫未見列席。</p>

<p>「路透社華盛頓十二日電」勞工部長許威倫巴赫十二日向國會提出管制工資抑低物價之特別建議，渠謂物價管制，應祇限於下列物品：　基本影響生活費用之主要物品，　對於晨工生產價値有基本關係之物，　對於推進美國外交政策有主要關係之物。</p>

<h3>美蘇樽前聯歡　馬歇爾欵宴莫洛托夫</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾今晚在美大使館中宴請莫洛托夫，維辛斯基及蘇駐英大使柴魯平，　以答宴莫洛托夫於十二月五日款待馬歇爾。當莫洛托夫款待馬歇爾之時，蘇大使拒絕談及有關政治之事，祗限社交問題，但此次馬歇爾將能改變作風，預料渠將表明美國立塲，以試探蘇聯最後態度。各代表皆感覺此次會議之攤牌時期業已到達，若干代表指出如莫洛托夫不改變共主張，則在此次會議休會前，可能廢去若干時日整頓各問題。</p>

<p>「本報訊」倫敦十二日廣播：巴黎訊，據此間蘇聯大使館方面人士稱，日來又有蘇聯公民四人在巴黎被拘，另有三人在馬賽被拘。渠不知被捕者之姓名，亦不知其被捕原因。先前被驅逐出境者，係業已取得蘇聯公民籍之「白俄」。法國內政部發言人今日宣稱，在上月份中，計有蘇聯公民廿四人被逐出境，另有二人因不願前往德境蘇佔區，目下仍在法國。至於新近又有人被拘一節則非事實，僅有蘇僑遣返委員會之委員數人，因尙未離開法境，而被護送至國境。按法國境內有「白俄」七萬五千人，自第二次大戰以來，已有一萬一千人取得蘇聯公民籍，其中已有一千五百人返歸蘇聯矣。</p>

<p>房門反鎖</p>
<p>從容逸去。死者二子並同告失蹤，案情撲朔迷離。茲分誌詳情如次：緣被害者晋德明，係四川簡陽縣人，現年卅三歲，娶妻鄒氏，係再醮，夫婦感情融洽，迄今已育有二子一女，長子五歲，次子三歲，三女甫於．本年四月出生。抗戰時期，晋原在萬區警備指揮部迫擊砲第一營任准尉彈　隊長，旋升任中尉排長，勝利後編餘，入廿八軍官總隊，今年二月，始入吳縣團管區任職，寶林寺前房屋內，同居共有六家，晋有勤務兵楊惠民，</p>
<p>出入相從</p>
<p>晚間亦宿於晋臤室外聞，晋素性暴戾，時將楊責打，十日晚，晋公畢後會往小酒店買醉，並看電影，至九時許始返家安寢，翌日中午，同居者見晋房門反鎖，意爲外出，初尚不疑有他，旋以兒啼不止，乃啓疑甯，隔門相詢，祗開房內有細微呻吟，始知有異，急取梯爬高，自沿街窗內觀望，見晋夫婦均已倒臥血泊，經奔告保甲長轉報該管警所，憲兵隊及團管區，會同撬門入內，見晋妻仆臥鐵牀上，頸部斧創七處，血跡糢糊，奄奄一息，　伏臥牀前地板上，短褲赤足，頭部</p>
<p>被砍八斧</p>
<p>流出，平已氣絕　上，披褥滿染鮮血，凌亂異常，似在被害時曾竭力掙扎，兇器柴斧一柄，匿單被下，勤務兵楊惠民，及晋之二子，問告失蹤，幼女則安然臥於被內，啼哭不已，室內僅失去手提箱一只，及自衛左輪手槍一支。傷者　鄒氏旋即經送公啓院急救。</p>

<p>今日乘危之</p>
<p>晉妻鄒氏</p>
<p>傷勢益見好　，巳能斷　作語。團管區司令杜緒上校及警局刑警隊長錢樹霖，得報後，即先後赴公醫院病房探訊，期自被害人口中獲得兇犯綫索，及出事經過。惟因晉鄒氏被砍七斧，均在頭部，前腦，後腦，當時均受劇烈震動，致神智失常，言語糢糊，對所訊均答非所問，結果毫無所獲。據該院副院長張雷醫師稱：該晉鄒氏恢復神智，恐將非三四日所可能。</p>

<h3>處理特快電話之因難及今後改進計劃</h3>
<p>— 季良</p>
<p>上海電信局自去歲十二月開放京　間，及本年一二月相繼開放吳縣，杭州，嘉興，鎭江，無錫，鄞縣等處特快電話以來，迄將一載。創辦之始，市民莫不稱便，蓋當時情形，確能做到「迅速」「準確」「便利」之地步，爲各界所稱許。惟近來用戶需要量與日俱增，而本局限於機綫容量，致時有停掛情事發生，外界不明內中實情，似有所不滿，但一經解釋，即不難瞭解。茲謹將處理特快電話之困難情形闡述於後，以供各界之參考。</p>
<p>上海爲國內唯一大商埠，全國金融商情，均以上海馬首是瞻，而上項消息，多賴以特快電話傳遞。經統計，開放初期每日由上海發往各地之特快電話總數，僅約三百次左右，嗣後逐漸增加，迄今則日違千餘次，其中以發往南京，無錫，杭州，鄞縣等地爲較擁擠，無錫尤甚。本局至上述各地之直　電路，為滬京十六路，滬杭八路，滬吳七路，滬鎭四路，滬都四路，滬嘉三路，均需與受話地點來去各半，簡言之，上海能寬際使用之電路，僅佔上述數字之半數，而每一電路，每小時能實際通話者最多六次，試就以無錫爲例，每小時祇能通十八至二士次，用戶呌發特快電話，又均集中於辦公時間（即上午九時至下午五時）咸盼於該時間內接通，但本局應顧及接通時限（十分鐘）及電路容量，故遇過分擁擠時。迫不得已，祇有暫停掛號，俟已掛者疏通後，再行繼續接受新掛用戶，此爲不能暢通原因之一。其次爲上海長話用戶，百分之九十八爲美商上海電話公司之用戶，共有六萬餘號，按照規定，每一長途電路，應配備出中繼綫（由長途台叫接本市用之連絡錢）一對，目前本局通達國內各地之有綫電路共七十路，無綫電路三路，（通重慶，漢口，天津，靑島，北平，廣州，台北，濟南等地）中美國際無綫電路兩路。但現有之出中繼綫，連通知綫等一併計算在內，共僅六十對，不敷甚鉅，致通常訊有二十餘長途電路，因中繼綫無着，虛位空待，此實為造成擁擠之最大原因。再次，在通話繁忙時間，市內電話之表軌聲，往往異常遲緩，浪費時間，致　　於長話接通次數頗多。</p>
<p>綜上而觀，可知欲求改善目前之長途電話業務，第一應增加出中繼綫，本局雖　向公司要求增加，但公司正因機綫缺乏，申請外匯困難，無法答應。為謀民衆之利益計，本局已與公司取得密切之聯絡，俾便共同設法研究解決此　困難問題。第二，為增加長途電話電路在此方面，本局已作種種準備，除沿京滬鐵路綫，已完成四心電纜一條，沿京滬公路新架長途話棧兩對，及添裝大量載波電話機外，復向美國訂購最新式長途台座席數十座，以期「量」與「質」同時獲得改進，故不久之將來，上海之長話業務，當可以新姿態爲社會服務也。</p>
<h3>電話用戶常識</h3>
<p>— 慕曾</p>
<p>試想假如在像上海這樣的都市中，一旦全市電話都失了靈，其後果將怎樣？政治上，商業上的各項接洽，皆須親自跑腿解決，不要說引起的麻煩怎樣重大，簡直都市的活動可以整個被麻木的！事實上，電話交通是成了都市繁榮不可或缺的一環了。不過，電話的重要儘管人人皆知，但能充份善加利用的，恐怕全市市民中百得一，由於誤用或不謹愼，以致使電話交通在技術上或者管理上蒙受不必要的因難，這對於用戶和局方兩方都是損失。本文的目的就想提供一些關於電話方面的簡明知識（限於市內電話），而且在解釋上，我們將偏重在上海電信局方面的用戶，即俗稱「〇二」電話。</p>
<p>上海電話分區</p>
<p>原來上海全市電話交通分屬於二個機構，一爲上海電信局，是交通部的附屬機關；一爲美商上海電話公司。前者管轄的地區是虹口，閘北，南市，浦東，市中心等地，後者的地區是舊二租界及越界築路等地。這二個機構是完全獨立不相關的，由於雙方採用根本不同的接錢制度，以致雙方的互通電話，須經煩瑣的手續，加以雙方都採用伍位號碼，往往彼此的用戶號碼有類伺的，譬如上海電信局（以下簡稱電局南市有七〇七三一用戶，上海電話公司（以下簡稱公司）亦有七〇七三一用戶，這樣誤接的機會是很多的。</p>
<p>今將二方面的分區情形略述一如下：</p>
<p>屬於電局者：</p>
<p>（一）「五」字頭——市中心區。</p>
<p>（二）「六」字頭——虹口，閘北，（武進路以北）傎茹，吳淞等區，（虹口）</p>
<p>（三）「七」字頭——南市，浦東，龍華等區。（南市）</p>
<p>屬於公司者：</p>
<p>（一）「一」字頭——黃浦以西，蘇州河以南，河南路以東，巾正東路以北。（中央）</p>
<p>（二）「二」字頭——滬西越界　路區。（江蘇）</p>
<p>（三）「三」字頭——蘇州河以南，梵王渡路以東，中正中路以北，黃河路以西，（西局）</p>
<p>（四）「四」字頭——蘇州河以北，沙涇河以西，武進路以南，西藏北路以東。（北局）</p>
<p>（五）「五」字頭——沙涇河以東舊租界區。（匯山）</p>
<p>（六）「六」字頭——一部在「西」局，一部在「汾陽」局。</p>
<p>（七）「七」字頭——中正中路以南，徐家匯路以北，華山路以東，重慶南路以西。（汾陽）</p>
<p>（八）「八」字頭——重慶南路以東，徐家匯路以北，民國路以西，中正東路以南。（雲南）</p>
<p>（九）「九」字頭　蘇州河以南，河南路以西，中正東路以北，黃河路以東。</p>
<p>由上可知，電局的市中心用戶可能與公司的匯山區用戶號碼相同，電局的南市用戶與公司的汾陽區用戶戶號數相等。</p>
<p>如何打電話</p>
<p>現在我們可以講到如何打電話了，若是電局用戶打電局用戶，或公司用戶打公司用戶則僅須先聲表軌聲，然後撥號即可，之後等着，聽到搖鈴聲則被打用戶是空閒着，一定有回答的，苦是聽到繁忙聲，則被打的不空，須稍歇再打，以上恐怕是每個人都知道的。現在問題是電局用戶打到公司用戶，及公司用戶打到電局用戶，若是電局用戶打到公司用戶，則須照樣先聽表軌聲，然後撥「〇」，再聽另一種稍有不同的表軌聲，（注意，必須「不同」，若是相同的，則再撥「〇」），聽到後，再撥所須要的號碼，以後的事情是同樣的。</p>
<p>反過來說！若是公司用戶打到電局用戶則亦照例先聽表軌聲，然後撥「〇2」，等着，有一個女性聲音回答你「〇2打啥號頭？」你就告訴她要什麼號碼，後以的事情也是同樣的。</p>
<p>所以，在你打電話之前，先要確定被打的到底是屬於電局或者公司，然後再能着手撥號，要確定到底屬於那一家，請查電話簿，凡有「　」者則勝電局，否則屬公司。</p>
<p>注意：有時在你沒有撥完號碼之前，已經聽到繁忙驟，那表示機鍵繁忙，無法爲你服務，你只有等一會再打。總之，只要聽到繁忙聲，硬敲硬撥是無用的，（機件可能因此損壞！）你只有等待再打。</p>
<p>電話的障礙</p>
<p>凡爲機械，必有發生障礙的機會，電話亦不能例外。不過一架電話發生障礙，用戶也應該知道一點對付的方法，否則徒說電話不靈，責斥管理常局，與事無補的，因爲良好的維護是要靠用戶與局方（公司）兩方合作的。</p>
<p>障碳的種類，大別可分三類：第一類是話機本身，其病狀是：講得出而講不出，或者聽得到而講不出，再有雜音，音遠等。第二類障礙是「電纜」，即自用戶機接至局內（公司）機鍵室中間的速綫。電纜發生障礙，則當用戶將話機聽筒提起靜聽時，必不能聽得表軌聲，而對話筒吹風時，聽筒中必毫無感覺。（平常機綫正常時，對話筒吹風，在聽筒中可聽到。）第三類障礙在於局中（公司）的機鍵方面，若用戶在聽筒中靜聽有特殊怪聲發生，則障礙可能屬於此類。</p>
<p>上述分類，只是大概的鑑別方法，事實上非經詳細機械測試，障礙是不能確定的，不過，遇有障碼發生時，用戶切勿自作總明，動手修理，因爲盲目的動手，原來障礙未經修復，而新的障礙倒又添加了！</p>
<p>用戶遇有障礙時，第一步是通知局方（公司），若是電局的則撥呌「1〇1」（或者直接至局內報告），値機人員當即加以測試，而後決定修復的步驟。若屬公司者則撥呌「〇1」，必有同樣的答復。修復的日期，可能是當日，或者須數日之久，那　看障礙的重大程度了？（用戶有一種心理，往往想一經通　　立即修復，不過事實上，有時在技術方面是不可能的。）</p>
<p>電話的維護</p>
<p>最後，要講到電話機應如何維護，維護的責任當然是在局方（公司）當局，不過用戶亦有一點維護的義務。換句話說，只要用戶使用小心，方法確當，不必說可以省去局方（公司）許多不必要的修理，而對於電話交通的效率也可以增進不少。現在就普通簡單的用戶維護電話應注意的幾點申述如下：</p>
<p>（A）使電話機隔離潮濕，「電」的能性最怕潮濕，所以茶水等物最好不要接近電話天雨，亦足以使電話失靈。</p>
<p>（B）不要將電話機過於　動。（像傾跌衝撞等）</p>
<p>（C）撥號時，當指孔扳轉回時，切勿以手指强迫其回原，强迫回原，是以使撥號擊損壞，且使撥號不準確。</p>
<p>（D）勿將「擱又」（即擱住聽話筒的東西）任意敲撳。</p>
<p>（E）不要將話機拆開，加以不必要的檢修。</p>

<h3>介紹交際電報</h3>
<p>— 陶庸</p>
<p>年節將至，用交際電報作賀禮，最經濟，最迅速，最大方。</p>
<p>「交際電報」不是新興的業務，遠在抗戰前已經開放，後來戰時軍事通訊頻繁。各地電路容量不够，不得己中止辦理。勝利後電信業務恢復了常態，自三十六年一月一日起，先在各特局及一等局恢復。因爲「交際電報」具有許多優點和方便的地方，就逐漸被國人注意起來，特別在這個節約的年頭，要用實物來慶賀或弔唁，非特不經濟。並且，要是親友處在遠地。不便送禮，交際電報便可解決這些困難。賀電之外，還可以附贈禮券，傎是說得上「經濟迅速」，「美觀大方」。</p>
<p>那幾種事情屬於「交際」</p>
<p>「交際電報」的範圍很廣，大體說，有慶賀，弔唁，慰問，歡迎歡送，答謝等等，慶賀類最多，婚姻，壽誕，添嗣，典禮，紀念，開張，年節都爲這類。</p>
<p>到什麼地方去拍</p>
<p>上海電信局的總營業處（福州路七〇號）和幾個示範營業處，（長治路二五號，中山南路五九號）都收受這種電報</p>
<p>計費和字數</p>
<p>「交際電報」是一種康價電報，照普通電報半價收費（中文每字五百元，英文每字一千元），並且電文可由電信局譯出，不收譯費。每通電報中文的以廿字英文的以十字起算，換句話說，每份以一萬元起碼，如果選用電局備好的現成辭句，只按八個字計算，至於收報人的姓名住址和發報人在電文內的署名，也都按字計算，這樣。除了八個字的電文成語外，至少還有十二個宇可寫，：報費不會超過太多的。</p>
<p>現成辭句供你選用</p>
<p>「交際電報　的去報紙和普通去報紙不同，它的紙張光潔較大，上面印着「交際」（SLT）作爲納費標識。背面印着九十四條各種不同性質的現成辭句，任你選擇錄用，詞句典雅，切合實際需要。</p>
<p>美觀大方意義深遠「交際電報」的來報紙是特製的，分緋色和藍色二種，除弔唁事項用藍色外，其餘的概用緋色，紙質聲實，印刷精繳，圖案美麗，足以引起對方的好感。舉個例來說，假如你的親友在外埠結婚，在舉行婚禮前的數小時內拍張「交際電報」，它可在你無想的時間內送達，對方在欣喜之餘接到那張粉紅色的比禮券還精緻華麗的賀電紙，會覺得分外喜悅的，它要比一副對聯或喜幛有趣，有意義得多，何况寄給遠地親友們的對聯或喜幛要好幾天才送到呢！「交際電報」旣可克服時間上的困難，又可解決金錢上的無謂浪費，使對方感到新奇滿意，所以它是現代社交塲中不可或缺的一種工其，是講究交際人們的新鮮玩意兒。</p>
<p>附贈禮券就是現金</p>
<p>拍「交際電報」還有一種特別的便利；如果你要送禮給對方，禮金不必由銀行匯去，只要附送「交際電報」的禮券就够了。禮券自一萬元起至二十萬元止。每電除應收報費外，不計禮金多寡，每電只收手續費三千元，如此，又可以省下一筆匯費或郵費。收報局收到附有禮券的交際電報，就在投撻電報時附送禮券或現金，用不着收報人自己來領取，傎是方便之至。</p>
<p>交際新花樣</p>
<p>「交際電報」還可以用傎蹟書寫拍發，價格比普通傎　電報便宜二成，對方看見親筆書寫的，尤其重視。它同樣可以附送禮劵。這種辦法，自本年十二月起在京滬兩地開始實行，還看「交際電報」中專門慶賀最近當選的國大代表，呌做「賀送電報」，價格也是减半收費的。</p>
<p>現在開放地點</p>
<p>「交際電報」現在已經開放的地方有上海，南京，漢口，天津，北平，唐山，昆明，桂林，西安，貴陽，長沙，南昌，牯嶺，衡陽，重慶，成都，曲江，萬縣，瀘縣，宜濱，合川，內江，廣元，汕頭，廣州，福州，蘭州，廈門，九江，吉安，鄞縣，永嘉，徐州，宜興，無錫，鎭江，吳縣，杭州，濟南，靑島，台北等四十一址，其中除廣州台北外，都可以附贈禮券。</p>
<h3>特快電報</h3>
<p>— 君仲</p>
<p>各種電報中，最快，最準確的要算特快電報了。拍一次特快電報，比起同樣字數的加急電報來，只多化了八千元的「特快專送費」，但論起速率和效果，比加急電更合算，它能保證在一小時半內傳遞到收報人。在任何塲合，電信局對於特快電報是特別優待的；收發報人享有優先遞送和拍發的權利，免費校對，保證絕對無誤。當發報局拍出以後，對方須拍回一個「收妥承認」，如此，「遺失」就根本不可能了</p>
<p>在特快電報的去報紙上應寫明「特快」字樣，最近上海電信局正在設計一種專用的「特快電報去報紙」，以資醒目。</p>
<p>這種電報通達的地方，比較有限制，必需發報局和收報局有直達電路而且要在工作不擁擠的情况下才能開放。上海電信局可以通達的地方有南京，天津，北平，漢口，靑島，福州，廣州，台北，重慶！蘇州，無錫，鎭江，杭州，鄞縣等地。</p>
<h3>電花</h3>
<p>上海電信局中文電報掛號已續充三萬號，自五四〇〇〇一至五六九九九九。今後電報掛號自能供給裕如，無需登記。</p>
<p>特快電報自十二月一日起繼續開放西安，南昌，永嘉，蕪湖四處。</p>
<p>凡屬上海電信局「〇二」電話用戶電話費，各分營業處均可照收。</p>
<h3>電信常識講話</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>第三講　怎樣選用特別業務（續）</p>
<p>分送　當某廠有某種新出品敢某特約經銷商有某種新貨品開始應市的時候，如果能用電報向各地經銷商介紹推薦，一定會使收受電報的經銷商感覺情意殷勤而樂意接受；在物價動　的當口，製造或批發廠商如果能把每次的整後的新價格隨時用電報通　各地徑銷商，必然會使經售者感覺服務週到面增進信用；講到這裏，或許有人要問：　拍發電報的費用比較印發傳單或登載報紙廣告要貴得多，如果一次拍發幾十或幾百份電報，這　費用相當可觀，呌我們那裏負得起！好，請且慢着急吧！這裡，筆者正要給你介紹一種拍發多數電文詞句相同的電報的最最經濟實惠的好方法，那就是選用分送特別業務辦法。　如果能把握住選用分送特別業務的訣竅，也就等於握有了一把發展業務增進推銷力的鎖鑰。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我們隨便舉個例子來說明分送特別業務的用法：假定上海有一家大中肥皂廠新出一種電話牌肥皂，他可以在開始應市的時候，先把各地平時向該廠定貨最多的經銷商的名稱和地址逐一查明統計，然後分別每地拍發採用分送特別業務的電報一份，把設在同一地方的各經銷商的名址逐一列入（如收報人在當地電局掛有電報掛號，也可用電報掛號代漿收報人的名址），并在電首寫明「分送若千份）或TM……（份數）標識，例如：TM3漢口＝中山路（15）號華中公司＝中正路（24）號漢口商店＝江漢路（181）號大衆行＝（電文和發報人署名）。或：TM30022＝3352＝1129C　漢口＝（電文和發報人署名）＝假定上面三組碼子是華中公司，漢口商店和大衆行的電報掛號。</p>
<p>漢口電局在收到這張電報之後，立即抄成三份，分別投送給華中公司，漢口商店和大衆行各家一份，而且每一份上祗抄收報人名址一處，即送給華中公司的一份祗在收報人名址內寫華中公司處，并不把漢口商和大衆行的名址列入，送給漢口商店和大衆行的亦然，這樣，可以使發報人保持商業上的機密。如果發報人因特殊需要，要求漢口電局把所列多個收報人名址在每一份分抄的電報裏完全錄出，也就是說發報人希望讓每一個收報人都能够看出這張電報是分送給那幾個收報人的，祇要在分標識之送後，再加寫一「全錄」或CTA　標識，電局就可以照辦。</p>
<p>另一方面，如果你準備拍發一張極有時間性的當報給一位居住在重慶的身兼數職的重要人物，假定這位收報人現在所擔任的職務是天星化工廠的廠長，新大百貨公司的總經理，同時又是當地商會的會長，他每天要輪流到上面三處去辦事。有時又要回到他自己的住宅裏去，而且那個廠，公司，商會和住宅之　的距離都很遙遠，你如果把電報打到廠裏而當電報送到他都在百貨公司辦事，或則你把電報打到商會裏而收報人恰巧剛綫返回住宅，稍不湊巧，便會遭受延　。在這種塲合下，你也可以選用分送特別業務，把同一收報人在同一地方的多個住址完全列入（如有電報掛號者可用掛號　代名址），並在電首加託「分送若干份」或TM……：（份數）標語，例如：</p>
<p>TM4重慶＝化龍橋天星化工廠王天一＝中山一路（58）號新大公司王天一＝市商會王天一＝兩浮支路（38）號王天一＝（電文及署名）</p>
<p>常重慶電局收到這張電報後，立即抄成四份，分別送往上面所開的四個地址，這樣，當電報送達的時候，無論收報人現在什麼地方，都能立刻接到這封電報。</p>
<p>採用分送特別　務的電報，不論分抄多少份數，祇照一張電報收費，電報裏所列的各個收報人名址的字數，一併照實有字數照算，並另外加收分抄費，現行分抄費的價日是每份不滿五十字者收費二千五百元（相當於華文明語尋常電二個半字的報費），超過五十字名每加一至五十字加收二千五百元，這樣低廉的費用，連買一份信封信箋加上一封平信的郵費都不到嘿！（待續）</p>

<h3>全國花紗布管制委會　委員顧問人選决定　管理實施細則亦經擬訂就緒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國花紗布管制委員會管理實施細則，刻已經紡調會主委袁良，會同各關係方面擬訂就緒，一二日內將由袁氏親自携呈中樞當局，俾討論通過後，即部署會務成立事宜。</p>
<p>管制委會委員及　問人選，昨亦由經濟部　到，計委員有袁良，劉泗英·劉攻芸·顧敏瑔·胡竟良·王嵐生·劉文騰·等七人，以袁良兼主委，劉泗英兼　主委。顧問東云章·李升伯·王啓宇·吳味經·榮爾仁·唐星海·第十七人。</p>
<p>管制委員成立後，勢將物色大批管制及執行業務之人員，惟一時羅致匪易，故頗有意借調紡建公司全國各分支機構原有人員，採用代營方式。聞紡建當局，以管制與業務不同，擅理業務者，未必善於執行管制政務，故對代營一點，表示　於接受云。</p>
<h3>紗價又見回升　布疋買氣甚盛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市又見回漲，紡調會特臨時在棉紗市塲售紗，結果准購者共一五七戶，售紗共一一二件，合廿支紗一三五四件，標價亦較前略增。</p>
<p>廿支金城三一二〇萬元，廿支五子·帆船·仙女·金　鷄·新三多三〇七萬元。廿支紅蜂·富貴·金元寶·三〇三〇萬元。六支一五四〇萬元，卅二支四千萬元，四十支四二八〇萬元，四十二支　股四九〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉紗市况以織廠見價低吸納，客帮亦有採辦，喊價頻頻上揚。四十二支藍鳳細紗最到五千萬　，十一點半紡建再度掛牌，接受同業申請，以廿支為大宗，配售有十四種之多，行情頓吿虛軟，一般浮多，獲利吐售，臨收價稍回硬。結果四十二支藍鳳細紗昂至四千九百二十萬元，比上日猛漲二百萬，四十支各檔張勢更烈，有自一百五六十萬至三百萬之譜，其他各支粗細紗，一致回升一百十萬至一百四五十萬不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開交易闊散，行情平穏，旋因門莊吸進甚夥，客帮亦來採納，染廠對低檔細布頗加　靑，實力派捷提愈恒，買勢加强，市勢頓見飛揚。迨至最後，十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，一致續漲二萬至五萬元。龍頭細布週一出貨，昂至一百卅七萬成交，其他漂粗布色布及嗶嘰直貢等，市均挺秀。</p>
<h3>取消官價外滙說　純屬謠言</h3>
<p>調整市價滙率亦不可能</p>
<p>全經會日前通過米麥麵粉棉花煤肥料等、　要進口貨，均將按掛牌市價結外滙，俟國務會議通過後，可望即實行。惟昨日此間忽謠傳當局即將取消官價滙率，且將澈底調整市價匯率說，致人心頗起激盪。</p>
<p>據外匯平凖會某委員透露，上項傳說，純為不確。因上述各項物資進口情形特殊，如棉花有行總救濟棉花，國行與花旗銀行簽訂之貸款棉花，曁以紗向印度掉換棉花等數種，均係政府所控制，米麥麵粉等情形亦相仿，毋須消耗官價外匯。</p>
<p>且該曾成立後，迄今並未有同人申請購買上項進口外匯情事，所謂取消官價外匯說·純屬無稽。至澈底調整市價滙率說，亦為事實上所不可能，決不至實現云。</p>

<p>菉豆南洋搜羅，高貨進胃極貪，飛升三五萬元，中次去化平平，無甚榮辱，提高殺低甚烈，赤豆所交有限，依然少神。豇豆成交亦稀，呆漲之局，　豆零化轉暢，突漲二三萬元。</p>
<p>紅糧北洋進胃蟬聯，續升萬元，苞米北方銷路平平，暫無變化。生仁到銷兩接，高俏次疲。芝蔴油廠抓吸，天津暢納，本街隨之加强，飛奔六七萬元。</p>
<p>油市全面上漲，生油奔跳七八萬元，菜蔴油相繼上漲八九萬元，豆油亦升五六萬元，淸油及小車蔴油飛騰十萬元，午時消胃轉懈，略見軟化。</p>
<p>過程乍起乍落　華股動盪不定</p>
<p>華股昨情况見混亂，外匯有開放之傳說，賣買雙方各持成見，業外游資有納，但有力集團，則在塲外力售，且有翻空行動，過程乍起乍落，除華豐搪瓷遞交股在收市時驟吿漲停外，餘者起仆不一。</p>
<p>晨開以報載美總統有三億元之援華計劃而見疲，永紗以四四三元，及四五六元之價開盤，開後即有利買流言，當即哄高至即交四五七元，遞交四七二元高價。旋以紛加了結者多，仍吿下降至四四〇元及四五〇元，塲外息價仍開二角五分半及三角，尙少變化。及進至四五〇元及四六〇元外時，塲外有某方集團力售，並有翻空傳說，而見四三七元及四四六元低價。其後又好起十餘元，但不久又遭迫低，情况混亂，各出全力相搏鬥，午收為四四二元及四五四元。遞交華豐漲停彩，商務新股以高價收市，較增資前亦見漲高。結果較前收即交股華豐中法各漲一成左右，新亞國貨升半成，閘北中紡榮豐勤興內衣新華微升，中泥景綸大通中興均平，永紗言和華新統益美亞中絲火柴新光景福永公　安微降。遞交股華豐漲停，勤興小升，永紗信和美亞新光景福咸吿微降，塲外各老股仍見堅挺，漢冶萍獨昂一成。</p>
<p>統債加漲　外股平穏</p>
<p>公債昨吿回漲，統丙晨開二六五〇〇元，自二六三〇〇元起，漲到二八三〇〇元而後略平，成交維五百萬。結果較前收計甲乙升一千元，丙漲一千三，丁升八百元，統戊昂起二千一。</p>
<p>外股昨　股咸在高檔盤旋，過程狹窄，港申電仍在三元半光景，尙乏特變，怡紗晨開四一五〇〇〇元，自四〇九〇〇〇元起，升至四一七〇〇〇元而後稍平。金匯帮大戶有買，散戶則出，結果較前收計戶德豐祥泰電話電車　植平平，怡啤漲半成，餘股榮　均微。</p>
<p>行總配棉</p>
<p>行總公佈：六日一週內，本　依照與紗廠所訂以棉易紗辦法，配與中紡公司及大同統益、利泰，德豐，嘉豐等紗廠之棉花，共八·三九〇噸，計中紡公司七·〇三一噸，其他五紗廠一·三五九噸。換來之紗，由本署出售，以平抑紗價，得款充長期善後事業之用。本週在滬分配及運往外埠物資共計一〇·九八九噸，就中棉花一項佔統分配量百分之七十二。</p>
<p>呢絨交易稀少</p>
<p>昨星期六，呢絨交易不多，大批　戶進出咸少，門市零剪生意亦趨寂寞。標準行情，雖有種種利買消息，然受實銷荽疲及銀根關係，始終只能保持現狀。平厚呢大衣呢麥而登等，因實銷已過半，齊成明穏贈降之象。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>又中國紡建公司昨亦循例售布，共售布二二一八〇疋，被　四四〇條，申購　共五五〇張，內除廠商廿九張，購布一四八〇疋外，餘均屬各布號所申購云。</p>

<p>肥皂狂漲</p>
<p>昨肥皂市面，以原料價貴，禪商鮮有共售，市上現貨不充，塲內無做開，但塲外倣價異常混亂·一百廿塊一箱同本皂，竟哄商一百十五萬元，最後十三萬元有人賣出。箭刀皂一百十萬，　詳茂八十萬，其他光華亨利等皂，亦均上揚十萬左右。</p>

<h3>大鈔發行以來　出口貨價尙穏定　輸出情形仍未見開展</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自千元關金劵發行後，我國出口物資價格，上漲並不劇烈。蓋此類物資之價目，向以央行掛牌外匯為標準，後者旣無更動，故能暫時保持穏定。</p>
<p>至於目前之出口情形，據本市進出口業公會秘書長張耀章吿記者：由於政局及通貸情勢，出口殊無開展，匯率調整當時雖有助力，但非根本之計。</p>
<p>棉布外銷，國內期望甚股，但最近日與印度成立物物交易之協定，日本之棉布折合盧比價格，較之國產棉布為低廉。例如龍頭細布，日貨僅折合印幣三十九盧比，而國貨布四十盧比以上，對我棉布外銷計劃，自將發生困雖。</p>
<p>海味堅挺</p>

<h3>行局棉花押匯　四聯簽請主席核示</h3>
<p>國家行局，此次奉令停止各項貸款，對於穏定物價，安定市塲，頗著功效。據中央銀行某負實人談：此次國家行局停止貸款之直接作用二：　减少新購買者，　增加售貨者，因此物價可得平衡。</p>
<p>又悉：此次行局停止貸款，　花，麵粉押　，亦在停止之列，是否即予恢復，四聯總處已簽請主席核示。出口物資押匯，行局已斟酌情形求做，使出口物資，得以源源輸出，換取外匯。</p>

<h3>漁業近貌</h3>
<p>在烟波浩渺的萬頃海洋巾，在八千六百餘公里的中國漁區中，一邊是帆檣點點的木船以網罟等待魚蹤，一邊是乘風破浪的漁輸操縱着水族的生命；前者是民營漁業公司辛苦的經營，後者是行總漁管處新式的設備。在這種酷烈的對照下，民營漁業終於發出了絕望的呼喊，生產過程的懸殊造成他們兩者間今日的衝突。</p>
<p>民營漁業要求獲配漁輸，要來减少卸貨量；但是漁管處認爲：他們尚未具備運川新式漁輸的技術，貨量减少足够成脅民食。民營漁業又以爲因大量生產而使魚價跌落到快要成爲市民們主食的時候，他們的命運將不堪設想；但是漁管處在着眼於市民營養的觀點上表示不同意這種說法。</p>

<p>「西洋也有臭蟲的」，這句話的意思是說我們中華民國儘管這點不行那個不好，西洋各國也並不是如白　之無瑕，猶中國固有臭蟲，西洋又何嘗沒有。這話說得一點不錯。例如中國有過一次革命二次革命，西洋各國何嘗沒有，而且革得比我們還早，革掉的命比我們還多，我們有爲世詬病的內戰，美國的南北戰爭　道是外戰？我們偶有一二官吏於公餘之暇稍事貧汚，美國的記者們就手指頭戳着我們的額角大事指摘，其實正如聖經上所說：「爲甚麼看見你弟兄眼中有刺，却不想自己眼中有梁木呢？你自己眼中有梁木，怎能對你第兄說，容我去掉你眼中的刺呢？」說美國的眼中有梁木，我們一點也不寃枉他，只要稍去翻閱一下歷史，你就知道他們於南北戰爭時那稱官更貪活上下交征利的情形，和我們比較起來傎如耶穌所說的梁木與刺。</p>
<p>故西洋之也有臭蟲，也有混帳忘八蛋，是無可懷疑的史實，問題是何以西洋雖有臭蟲而床上被單不像我們這樣的血汚斑斑。此中道理，第一是西洋臭蟲是臭蟲，人是人，二者並非一物。因之第二是人給臭蟲咬了或一見到臭蟲就動手捉，越提越少，終至於絕無而僅有。</p>
<p>而中國則似乎不然。第一人與臭蟲好像不分，換言之，人即是蟲，蟲亦就是人。舉凡上床之動物，原爲臭蟲者固仍爲奧蟲，即本非臭蟲者亦大有一變而爲臭蟲之勢，故在床下時儘管指指點點的大駡臭蟲而不肯提，一上床之後更自然而然的爲臭蟲所同化。於是臭蟲就就越來越多，日久年深，一室皆滿，豈僅床上而已哉。</p>
<p>所以我們不必也不應指臭蟲而駡之，因爲我們本身就是候補臭蟲。</p>
<h3>美國軍人的出家熱</h3>
<p>— 凉庵</p>
<p>美國在今天是一個物質文明最發達，生活享受最充裕的地方；然而却年有大量美國人民，拋棄了塵世的繁華，走向淸凈的修院來過模實淸苦的宗敎生活。在天主敎的修會中，講到生活的淸苦和規律的嚴廑，莫過於所謂「脫拉比斯脫」（Trappist）了；但近年來，走向美國「脫拉比斯脫」修院的人却特別多。美國羅特島州的廣原聖母修院，最近就收了三十五位修士，其中二十五位且是美國的出征軍人。在美國的其它四個「脫拉比斯脫」修院，請求入院的人也很多。其中出征軍人的數H也很高。戰爭邀動了人的虛性，出征軍人在前線作戰，對於宗教的感覺，益爲銳敏，所以出征歸來，他們的紛紛走向修院尋求和平，原是可以了解的。據廣原聖母修院的院長說，有一個出征軍人之加人他們修院的經過是這樣的的：『我在前綫的時候，我們學會了夜巡邏和恐怖，又學會了祈禱。我之決定接受「西斯德辛」（Cistercian）生活就在這個時候；我側臥在一個淺淺的「狐洞」裏，當子彈在我們的頭上，呌囂飛過爆炸的時候，聽見一個孩子在不斷地唸着「天主啊，天主啊！」……我就感到我的信德還不够堅强，我的信心及愛心也不够。所以我向聖母祈禱，請他保全我，並且答應她加入「西斯德辛」會，來學習仁愛。他保全我了，要也加入「西斯德辛」會了。』</p>
<h3>混亂的製造者</h3>
<p>一個律師，一個醫生，一個建築師，一個共產黨——四個人爭論起來，論題是：這四種事業中那一種的資格最老，歷史最悠久。</p>
<p>律師說：「當然是我們律師。試問這世界上如果沒有法律統治一切，人類能相處到今天嗎？」</p>
<p>醫生冷笑一聲，說道：「你別忘了當年如果沒有產科醫生，亞當和夏娃的子孫就不會出世了。」</p>
<p>建築師悠悠抽了一口香烟，把眼鏡推了一推說：「你們琊是胡說。宇宙間最初祇是一片混亂，慢慢的使混亂成爲有秩序的各種建築，就都是建築師的功績了！」</p>
<p>共產黨起初祇是喝酒，默不作聲，聽到此地，哈哈大笑。他呌道：「對呀，宇宙間最初祗是一片混亂！但是，這混亂又是誰造成的呢？」（風）</p>
<p>原來所謂「脫拉比斯脫」本是從「西斯德辛」修會在法國諾曼地地方所建的一座「脫拉比修院」（Abbey　La　Tarppe）而得名的。這座修院在十七世紀時，對於他們所遵奉的會規有所修改，主張嚴格遵守會規；所以他們就被稱爲西斯德辛修會嚴守會規宗，此在英文，就是所謂（Cistercians　ofthe　Strict　Observance）因此就簡稱爲「脫拉比斯脫」或「脫拉比」宗。依照他們的會規，他們在平日每天須上午二時起床，在星期日及其它重大節日還要早，每天只能睡七小時，神修祈禱約亦占七小時，一小時用膳，四小時　書及私人祈禱，五小時勞作。除了生病療養以外，他們不食肉，喫魚，連鷄蛋也不喫；因此，他們以做乳酪，即所謂「且士」（Cheese）出名。除了和院長接談，或經院長指定爲指揮工作起見外，地們彼此間不許交談。所以他們是應該最能了解沉默的人。</p>
<p>在我們中國，也有一所「脫拉比斯脫」修院，那就是在察哈爾省懷來縣楊家坪的「神　院」。依據一九四〇年的統計，那裏有中國藉修士十一人，外國藉修士十三人。在荒凉的口北，他們在度着沉默的宗敎生活。</p>
<h3>天下之大</h3>
<p>英國議會的公報中，對普通的議員稱爲「可敬的議員」，對曾服軍職的議員稱爲r可敬而英勇的議員」，對會從軍而又執行過律師業務的議員則稱爲「可敬，英勇，而又淵博的議員」。</p>
<p>近有法格斯其人者，戴了養氣面其，自法國的賽特地方潛入地中海底，深八海平面下三百九十三呎（每方吋壓力爲一百七十五磅），造成新紀錄。舊紀錄爲二百九十五呎（每方吋壓力爲一百三十一磅）。但是法格斯終因體力不支，浮起後數小時即死。</p>
<p>美國國會在一七七六年通過了獨立宣言後，宣言的底稿即由原起草人傑弗遜帶回了家裏，久而久之，大家都忘了。一直過了四十七年之後，因爲要考據這底稿究係何人起草，才從他的家裏找出了這一件歷史上極珍貴的文戲。（樂）</p>
<h3>談玻璃絲襪</h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>讀十二日申報本埠版，有「市長向女界呼籲：何必穿破璃絲襪」一則新聞，其主體則是寫的「上海市市民服印國貨協會成立大會」，上面兩句是果市長在會中致詞的內容。</p>
<p>在今日强調提倡國貨之重要，是極應該的事情；而提倡國貨自服用國貨着手，的　也不失爲一種腳踏實地的做法，我們當然是　　之不遠的。</p>
<p>因爲我們擁護這個原則，所以我們要求：必須要正正經經地執行，換言之，要有效地執行，而不容許敷衍了事。</p>
<p>吳市長對太太小姐們說「何必穿玻璃絲襪」，用意是當然再好也沒有，但是，這樣稅法能產生多少效果，却實在就難說得很。我看古今中外無論那一位大政治家若要對太太小姐們的時裝有所生張，其成效恐怕往往都不甚車著的。以前禁止過女子燙頭髪，結果今日連我家的女傭都燙頭髪了；北平也禁止過穿短袖旗袍，結果在春夏之交，短袖旗袍之盛行如故；吳市長是淸華大學畢業的，淸華在十六七年以前禁止女同學穿西裝袴，遠者「拖尸」（“Toss”——老同學對新同學督責也），而今天淸華園裏的女同學穿西裝　的就決不在少！</p>
<p>我們男人的想法，的確，太太小姐們「何必」一定要穿玻璃絲襪呢？不過，再仔細一想，「何必」的事多極了：何必抹上了冷霜而又把它迎忙拭掉？何必搽粉——而且還要早晚搽不同的粉？何必涂口紅——而且還要以衣服　色之不　而稍異口紅志深淺？何必每年買幾只不同式樣的手提包？何必——對啊，何必穿玻璃絲襪，而且根本何必穿絲襪呢？</p>
<p>說是積極難改嗎？我看太太小姐們之喜歡打扮打扮，大概已由「積習」進而成為「天性」，如生物學者所謂「後天習得性」也者。故曰：呌她們不穿玻璃絲襪，老實說十之八九是辦不到的，恐怕吳市長自己也很明白。然則提倡國貨之道如何呢——曰：與其呌太太小姐們不要穿玻璃絲襪，不如國貨廠商們自己趕快設法仿造！</p>
<h3>記久大復業</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>華北方面國人自己辦的實業，有三個很有名的：啓新洋灰公司（河北），張裕釀酒公司（山東），久大精鹽公司（河北）。久大有益於民食，衛生關係尤巨，成績最彰。「七七」事變時，日寇摧殘擄掠，受損極大。光復後，始由內地歸來之幹部，及當地舊侶，收回整理，煞費經營，於今年十一月九日在津開戰後第一次股東大會，會議復員復工，一切就緒，實是値得紀念的盛典。</p>
<p>民以食爲天，人類不能淡食，故鹽又爲食之要素。中國「煮海」之業，自古有之，惟數千年來，只知食用「原鹽」不能科學製造，至於近代風氣開通，新工藝朋興，而此影響民族健康，國家利權的製鹽工業，直到民國初年始由「久大」幾個同志，經過長期問的努力，而克告成功，其製品爲精鹽；再製鹽，磚鹽，結晶鹽，洗滌鹽，及一切副產品。除民食外，工業用鹽及鹽的化學工業，關係各項工業之扳興者，至足注意。其總廠在天津之塘沽，其行銷遍及長江各埠及各大都市。民國二十六年一月改名「久大鹽業公司」，範圍擴大，事業蒸蒸日上，乃至七月，日寇發動「七七」事變，華北淪陷，敵人即將公司工廠全然據爲己有，北平之範圍（創辦人景　之住宅及公司辦事處）亦被佔。幹部人員先南下，後西行，入川「另起爐竃」（此典名實恰合）。據此次大會主席報告，隨國軍撤退轉向四川自流井從事「煮井」，扶植了西南半壁的鹽業，使西南食鹽受了科學洗禮，共同致力於戰時增產，八年的坎坷，演出了不少可泣可歌的史蹟，現在又踏上了復興之途。此種奇蹟，爲其他公司所未有，確是値得誇耀！</p>
<p>天津的久大總廠，日寇佔據之八年中，對於華人股東之權利，一字不提，郤肆意宣傳其工業技術之優良，鹽產之豐實，規模之擴大。乃勝利後久大所接收之　屋之機械，均已破壞修爛。塘沽製鹽廠只留得烟突半　。靑區之公司辦事處樓房被敵憲兵佔　，投降時樓上雜物全數帶走，甚至門上鎖鑰，也被卸去。乃知倭人惟知據掠資產，依然海寇積習，可笑可恨。</p>
<p>會塲上，創辦人景叟　　登台，此古稀老人，飽歷滄桑，依然淸健。他是癸卯科浙榜的舉人，與僞「維新政府」的梁鴻志，僞「華北政委會」的王揖唐都是鄉舉同年（梁閩榜，王江南榜）。觀於梁王之遺臭萬年，益覺克全名節如景叟之不可多得。然景叟爲董事之長，綜持大綱，至事實上之經營奮鬥，則總經理范旭東肩負尤巨。三十年之盤根錯節，「七七」以後之驚濤駭浪，艱難應付，其才實有大過人者。惜乎勝利初臨，即以積勞病故重慶。因思陸放翁遺囑詩：「死去。王師北定中原日，家祭毋忘告乃翁！」范君得見光復而死，亦足以傲放翁矣。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第三章　台上典台下（一四）</p>
<p>這時綺紈業已上台，飾着蘇三，跪在台上，大家都靜靜聽他唱，只有鳳笙仍是嘰咕嘰咕，問這戲是什麼戲情，蘇三爲什麼犯罪，爲什麼會審？雲　起初還告訴她，後來見她不理會，不願多說，只道你靜靜看，就知道了。鳳笙那看得懂，東張西望，信口批評，說綺紈臉上胭脂披得太紅，述手背上都擦雪花膏，又說鼻子太大，好似象一樣，唱的聲音太刺耳，又說這齣戲太沒意思，一點不會呌人發笑。小王媽就坐在旁邊，她所說的話，全聽在耳裏，不時抿着嘴笑一笑，趁便向渚齊拋了一兩眼，只急得渚齋渾身出汗，恨不得過去把鳳笙多話的嘴，給她堵住。再看台上的綺紈，一邊唱，一邊眼神也不斷向鳳笙身上掃來。這一齣玉堂春，本是渚齋最愛總的戲，很想藉此領略個中好處，以便明日和綺紈硏究，現在給鳳笙如此一來，弄得心神不安，台上的戲，一句也沒聽到耳裏。糊裏糊塗，這一　玉堂春就　完了，急忙忙引鳳笙和雲卿出去，好似逃難一般，擠出門口，　軍回去。到家裏，這位多話太太還不斷批許，說雪卿今天花錢請看這樣的戲，實在太寃。渚齋　務一肚子悶氣，對這位太太實在無話可說。料風笙所說的話，小王媽一定都告訴綺紈，次日覺得沒有而子再去見綺紈，在銀行裏，心中關悶，如有所失。</p>
<p>一直挨下午三點多鐘，意馬心猿，竟按捺不住，很想冒險往看綺紈，常面賠罪，又覺沒這勇氣，正在爲難，突然桌上電話機鈴聲響動，渚　接過一聽，竟是綺紈來的電話，立時渾身血液都沸騰起來，抖着嘴　應道：「我就是徐浙齋呀！」只聽綺紈格格笑了兩聲道：「徐先生：你今天早上爲什麼不來？現在快下班嗎？我有話給你說，五點鐘在亞北番菜館等你，有工夫嗎？」渚齋連連應這：「有，有，準到，準到！」那邊又輕輕笑了兩聲，爲聲「再見」，電話就掛上了。淅齊在失望之下，突接綺紈電話，約他前去，受寵若驚，神經極度激刺，一個人幾乎喜得發狂，對桌上排列着許多簿記單據，那有心情再稽核，一古腦把牠放在抽屜內，在屋內　來踱去，眼巴巴只望着壁上大錶的秒針，一秒一秒的移動，渚齋的心弦，也一刻比一刻緊張。心上雖是興奮，可是一想到見面時，對綺紈應如何解釋，才能把昨晚鳳笙所說的話，得她諒解，又覺爲難；果然綺紈爲了聽小王媽報告，今天時約去質問，那就糟糕了！並且她在需話東曾說：「有話給你說」，是不是就爲這事呢？更是可慮。渚齋在這半點鐘之內，心頭忽喜忽憂，去，怕她質問；不去又覺錯過機會，心裏竟有些把特不定。（本章完）</p>
<h3>女人的心</h3>
<p>— 馮允莊</p>
<p>聖經上曾說起上帝造人，在造女人的時候因爲材料用盡了，祇好拚凑起來，而以亞常的肋骨爲女人。後來不知道是經過幾度進化呢還是退化？據說婦人之心是最毒的了，這也怪不得她們，因爲受壓抑愈甚，其所蘊結之怨恨愈深，一旦發作起來自然難以收拾的了。而且社會上的眼光本是勢利的，人打狗視爲當然，狗咬人乃是大逆不道。因此張巡殺妾　壯士，平原君斬美人頭以謝客等故事，千古傳爲美談，而刁劉氏謀殺親夫却非遊四門唱小調以羞辱之不可，羞辱以後再加以剮刑，然後大快人心。便在自由平等民主的今日吧，詹周氏殺夫也比男子因外遇而謀斃髪妻的新聞要鬨動一些，蓋女人向被視爲低等動物故也。</p>
<p>婦女運動自十八世紀的後半期起，提倡是有人提倡過了，如法國的辜傑與羅蘭夫人，英國的華爾斯東克拉夫脫女士等，她們都主張男女應受同樣的敎育，經過同樣的職業訓練，然後可以自謀生存，不依賴男子。不渦在還個社會裏，自謀生存可也不大容易的事。而且即使女人能够自立了，因爲公共廚房與托兒所之缺乏，女人還得負起職業與家庭的雙重責任。有錢的男人喜歡太太是專任　，沒錢的男人在沒錢時固然不得不允許太太出外謀生，藉以减輕他的負担，然而不久以後他自己的收入增加了，還是希望太太能够安安穩穩地回到廚房來的。因此聯業婦女在婚姻方面很受打擊，同時在事業方面也不容易得到成功與安慰，因此婦女運動的提倡者雖言之諄諒，而社會上大多數婦女還是聽者藐藐的。</p>
<p>而且，女人若是傎能够永遠安安穩穩的在家裏做太太也還罷了，偏遇男人的心都不大安穩，同時他的地位及收入也大不安穩，因此女人要適應他們的要求頗不容易。許多有才或有貌的婦女在外面兜了一轉，要想再入籠也不可能了，因爲在人口比例說起來，即使未必一定女多於男，而是現在頂房子買傢俱的價錢太貴了，有許多應該結婚的男人討不起老婆，在少數有力負担家庭的男人羣中，要容納這許多待嫁的婦女，却也不是一件容易的事。偏偏憲法上面又明文規定一夫一妻制，於是許多「失嫁」或嫌獨身從事職業太苦的女人便都存着賣淫心理，蓋旣可獲得性的滿足，而又可解決經濟問題，又何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>尤其是長住在上海的女人，人家聽見她交了一個手面閥綽的男朋友，送給她鐵戒汽車與洋房，人人無不對她投射出羡慕的眼光；反之，她的男朋友著是貧困的，她稍予以事業或金錢上帮助，犬家就要鄙夷似的目她爲倒貼了，嗚呼，從事于婦女運動者該如何亟謀剷除此類娼妓心理！</p>
<h3>「自由」談</h3>
<p>— 少榮</p>
<p>自由不會降臨到一個民族，一個民族應當上進達到自由；這是一種應先獲得而後能享受的幸福。——卡爾登</p>
<p>自由與聯台，一體而不可分裂；現在是如此，而永久是如此。——韋白斯脫</p>
<p>當自由喪失了，生命就變爲無趣，並且失去了滋味。生命是什麼？牠不是走來走去，呼吸新鮮的空氣，或者是看望太陽；牠是要自由。——安迪生</p>
<h3>公私之間</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>人非草木，孰能無情，不過「情」要分開公和私來講，公是公，私是私，公私要分得淸楚。但若要將公私的界限分得淸楚，那非有冷靜的頭腦或者被目爲「戇頭　腦」的人不能辦到。據說姜太公斬妲己時，當姐己綁赴刑塲，太公命令創子乎殺頭，創子手看着妲己的面孔，「魂靈兒飛去了半天」，手骨軟了想不起來，刀也跌到地上去了，太公喝令再殺，結果仍是如此。太公知道這是姐已的美貌遏住了他的「殺心」，於是用布將妲己的面孔包起來，再令那劊子手去殺，結果毫不費力的身首異處了。我以爲姐己的「美」就是私情，那塊蒙面的「布」便是公事，辦公事的人，都要有這麼的一塊「布」，才可以執行任務；否則，手骨一軟，刀便落地了。但漢朝的蘇文需却沒有這塊布，也能公私不混，這便是蘇公的過人處。漢　蘇章傳略云：「章爲冀州刺史，有故人爲淸河太守，多姦贓。章行部至，將案之，乃請太守，爲設酒肴，叙生平甚懽。太守喜曰：人皆有一天，吾獨有二天。章曰：今日蘇文儒與故人飲，私恩也；明日冀州刺史案事，公法也。徑正其罪，郡吏肅淸。」我想：蘇公如果生在今日，一定是個「打虎」名將無疑。</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Debate on Postal and Telecommunications Price Increases, Petitioning the National Government to Halt Implementation, Various Committee Members Vigorously Defending the Spirit of the Rule of Law</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] Whether the adjustment of postal and telecommunications rates without completion of legislative procedures by the Legislative Yuan is legal became the most intense issue at the 342nd regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 13th. Legislators spoke enthusiastically and passionately, with a majority advocating for a halt to the price increases. Subsequently, Wang Yunwu, Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan, arrived at the Legislative Yuan on behalf of Premier Zhang to provide an explanation. Tao Fengshan, Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications, was also present for consultation. After three hours of debate, it was ultimately resolved to petition the National Government to instruct the relevant authorities to halt the implementation of the postal rate adjustment order issued on November 10th and to order the Executive Yuan to submit the case to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation.</p>
<p>Today's meeting was chaired by Liu Kejun, Chairman of the Legal System Committee, in place of Premier Sun, who was attending a meeting of the Central Standing Committee. As the agenda began, Wang Yuxiang immediately initiated criticism, expressing dissatisfaction with the relevant authorities for disregarding the Legislative Yuan's recommendations and hastily increasing postal and telecommunications rates. Legislators spoke up in succession. Chen Guyuan angrily pointed out that Premier Zhang had stated his respect for legislative power upon taking office, but the Executive Yuan's current actions were unprecedented even during the era of Song Ziwen's cabinet, clearly indicating the Executive Yuan's disregard for the Legislative Yuan. He believed that the Legislative Yuan had become a spent force, hence this impatient action, unaware that it would be criticized as illegal. Deng Hongye also believed that Premier Zhang, having been in office for less than a year, had done something that no previous Premier had done, completely contradicting his statements of respecting legislative power, and requested an explanation from the Executive Yuan. Chen Zifeng was even more vehement, suggesting that the case be referred to the Control Yuan. Tan Tiwu believed that the spirit of the rule of law must be vigorously defended, and from a legal standpoint, no one should engage in illegal actions, advocating for the declaration of the order as invalid according to the law and seconding the motion to invite Premier Zhang to the Legislative Yuan to provide an explanation. The above motion was approved by the entire Legislative Yuan, and Secretary-General Lou telegraphed Premier Zhang to come to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Around 10:45 AM, Deputy Premier Wang Yunwu arrived at the Legislative Yuan on behalf of Premier Zhang, explaining the process of the Executive Yuan's measures, pointing out that postal and telecommunications services were incurring significant losses, increasing the burden on the national treasury. In order to achieve self-sufficiency, frequent adjustments were necessary. He cited the precedent of the promulgation of the Banking Law, where a clause regarding the suspension of bank closures requiring judicial procedures was temporarily suspended. The Executive Yuan requested authorization from the State Council to grant a temporary special permission for the postal and telecommunications price increases to be adjusted at any time. As for the current order, it was issued by the State Council, then instructed to the Ministry of Communications by the Executive Yuan, and then transmitted to local post offices by the Ministry of Communications for implementation. Due to the vastness of the area, the order had already been issued. This was the factual process. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan absolutely respects the law and values legislative power, and this action had no other intention.</p>
<p>After Wang's explanation, legislators questioned him one after another. Chen Guyuan pointed out that citing the precedent of the Banking Law was inappropriate. It was not unprecedented to complete legislative procedures retroactively after prematurely increasing prices. The Executive Yuan's hasty action had malicious intent from the start, inevitably inviting the criticism of "what is in the heart is written in the policy," and could not be said to be complying with the law. Wang Shixian inquired whether the handling of this matter was so rapid and hurried, as if it were extremely urgent, whether the postal economy would be inconceivable without it. The National Reconstruction Special Contribution only concerned a small number of people, but it was repeatedly discussed and has not yet been implemented. The postal rate increase affects the entire population, yet it was implemented so hastily, which is illogical. Furthermore, while the Ministry of Communications emphasizes increasing revenue, has it exerted its utmost efforts to reduce expenditure? Post offices are extensively engaged in construction in various locations, postal workers receive generous salaries, and there are many redundant personnel. Why not start with food conservation? Wang Yuxiang said: If laws can be changed by order, why can't orders be changed by order? (Using a National Government order to change the postal and telecommunications price increase order of November 10th?) Democratic politics is troublesome politics. If the Legislative Yuan is considered troublesome, why not abolish it? Zhong Tianxin pointed out the importance of this matter, requesting the Executive Authorities to pay attention. If such behavior occurs in the future after the constitution is implemented, legislators can request the resignation of the Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>At this point, Sun Jiulu proposed a compromise solution, hoping that the Executive Yuan would immediately order a temporary price increase for a certain period, and then submit it to the Legislative Yuan for a remedy. Deputy Premier Wang also stood up to explain that the Executive Yuan had absolutely no intention of violating the law or disrespecting the Legislative Yuan, and recounted the hardships of adopting this measure. The legislators were still not satisfied, believing that the people could still send letters at the original price, and if the post office considered them underpaid, the people could file a complaint. Lin Bin explained that authorization should be based on the law, in a legal manner. The State Council cannot authorize; the Executive Yuan can directly submit a proposal to the Legislative Yuan. There are many precedents for this. To avoid increasing trouble for itself, the Executive Yuan can directly submit it to the Legislative Yuan. After the legislators finished questioning, Wang Yunwu intended to withdraw. Some legislators advocated for inviting Premier Zhang to the Legislative Yuan, and the debate was quite heated. Wang and others finally withdrew at 12:20 PM. The legislators continued to discuss, and based on Lin Bin's suggestion, made a resolution to petition the National Government to instruct the relevant authorities to halt the implementation of the postal rate adjustment order issued on November 10th and to order the Executive Yuan to submit the case to the Legislative Yuan for secret deliberation. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management in Afternoon Meeting, No Further Increase in the Number of Manchu Legislative and Supervisory Committee Members</h3>
<p>The meeting continued at 2:30 PM and passed the following resolutions: The State Council's resolution regarding the supplementary regulations for party nominations is consistent with the original intention of Article 12 of the National Assembly Delegate Election and Recall Law and the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Member Election and Recall Law. The content of the supplementary regulations for party nominations is as follows: 1. Members of the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party participating in the National Assembly delegate and Legislative Member elections must be nominated by their respective political parties. 2. Registration nominations using elector signatures are limited to non-party members. Regulations on the Appointment of Personnel in the Transportation Industry. Central Bank Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. Our Manchu representative, Pu, requested that the precedent set by the Mongolian and Tibetan cases be followed and that the number of Manchu Legislative and Supervisory Committee members be increased. The case was handled in accordance with the review opinion, giving sympathetic consideration to the request. However, the number of Supervisory Committee and Legislative Committee members is already large, and it is proposed that no further increase be made, but that the relevant authorities can make de facto adjustments. Amendments to the Supervisory Committee Election Regulations. According to the review opinion, the Supervisory Yuan's request to amend Article 6 of the Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law regarding the candidate's signature portion has already been promulgated and need not be discussed further. As for the amendment of Article 7 of the same law and Article 2 of its implementation regulations, which stipulates that the administrative heads of each province and city concurrently serve as election supervisors, in order to prevent abuses, as the Supervisory Committee members often target administrative heads for impeachment, it is deemed inappropriate for administrative heads to concurrently serve. The principle is highly sympathetic, but the election supervisors for the Supervisory Committee of each province and city in this session have already been clearly appointed by the National Government, and it is not convenient to change them at this time. Finally, several supplementary budget proposals for the 34th and 35th years were passed. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. (The full text of the Central Bank Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management is listed on the left corner of page two.)</p>

<h3>Sino-Indian Civil Aviation Agreement Decided to Be Extended for Three Months</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Indian Ambassador Menon said: "The Sino-Indian Civil Aviation Agreement has been agreed upon by both the Chinese and Indian governments to be extended for three months from its effective expiry date of December 15th.

<h3>Britain Replies to Sino-Soviet Note, Refuses to Discuss Japanese Peace Treaty in China</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 13th Broadcast: Britain has explicitly rejected the Soviet Union's suggestion to hold a preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty in China in January next year and does not accept the proposal by China and the Soviet Union that the four major Pacific powers should have veto power. The British government sent notes to China and the Soviet Union, strongly advocating that the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted as soon as possible and that all decisions should be based on a two-thirds majority vote. The British side believes that it would be more convenient to convene this meeting in Washington, as various Far Eastern countries currently have specialists in Washington. Regarding the veto power issue in the Japanese peace treaty, the British side believes that if the interests of all participating countries are not taken into account on an equal footing, it would only delay the early signing of the treaty. The British government's note to China was worded more mildly, but it refused to accept the participation of all member states of the Far Eastern Commission in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty. It is inferred that Britain may intend to allow Burma to participate in this work as well.</p>
<h3>Handling American Relief Supplies, Our Plan to Be Submitted to the U.S. Soon, 30 Million in Relief Funds Insufficient</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] It is learned that the "Implementation Plan for Relief Using American Relief Supplies" being discussed by the Executive Yuan's American Relief Supplies Committee estimates that the total number of people in the country affected by natural disasters and banditry reaches 48.9 million, of which 12 million cannot survive without relief, 8.7 million are destitute, and 570,000 are currently receiving relief, totaling 21 million people who must be provided with relief. The food needed for the above three months is approximately 9.7 million tons. According to this estimate, the 30 million US dollars in relief funds will be insufficient. After this plan is submitted to the U.S. representatives, it may prompt them to pay attention and consider how to make U.S. relief assistance more effective. The work items in the plan are divided into three categories: 1. Temporary emergency relief, 2. Work relief, 3. Constructive relief, including increasing and supplementing relief agencies, establishing rehabilitation centers for the disabled and special children's guidance centers, and establishing small-scale affordable housing in major cities to address housing shortages in Nanjing and other cities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to official sources: The Executive Yuan's American Relief Supplies Committee completed its plan for utilizing relief supplies on the 13th. A copy will be sent to Ambassador Stuart, who will forward it to the chairman of the China Relief Committee in Washington.</p>

The Kowloon Natives Association also sent representatives to the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi on the 12th to state their position and request that their views be conveyed to the central government.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Personnel in China Not Allowed to Take Beijing-Shanghai Trains, Travel by Military Transportation</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City] It is learned that U.S. Army personnel in China are not allowed to take the Beijing-Shanghai train line, fearing involvement in any incidents caused by Communist guerrilla sabotage.

All personnel traveling from Beijing to Shanghai are transported by military aircraft.</p>
<h3>Barter Policy with Japan to Continue Next Year, Central Trust Bureau Drafting Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Trust Bureau is currently drafting a barter plan for Japan for next year, which will be handled according to the precedents set this year. Sino-Japanese barter began in the winter of the 34th year. It was initially handled directly by the Executive Yuan, and from April of the 35th year, it was continued by the Central Trust Bureau. To date, this barter has lasted for more than two years, and the transaction amount has been increasing daily. At that time, the Executive Yuan established this policy because it was participating in the Allied nations' joint restriction of trade with Japan, and all industries and mines were in urgent need of restoration after the victory of the War of Resistance, and Japanese equipment could supply our country's needs. Therefore, after the decision was made, it was immediately implemented, focusing mainly on importing industrial and mining equipment. (Continued on page two, column one)</p>

<p>[Our Kaifeng Correspondent, 13th] Based on the current situation, it seems likely that the Chen Yi bandit troops in eastern Henan, who have long been rumored to be planning a major invasion of Bian and Zheng, are indeed planning one. Yesterday afternoon, approximately 80,000 to 90,000 bandits from the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th, and 11th columns had infiltrated the Weishi, Chenliu, Tongxu, Taikang, and Minquan areas, forming a fan-shaped formation for an invasion of Kaifeng.

The National Army has redeployed and believes that the prelude to the next major battle in the Dabie Mountain area will begin within days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] The remnants of Liu's 17th and 2nd columns, on the border of Henan and Hubei, failed to cross the Pinghan Railway and retreated back east of Jilong Mountain, currently waiting for an opportunity to escape on both sides of the Luoshan-Xuanhuadian highway. His 6th column fled northwest from near Huang'an to the Qiliping, Huangbeizhan, and Xuanhuadian line. On the night of the 12th, one unit secretly moved southwest, but they were defeated by the National Army and security regiments.

<h3>Differences in U.S. Congressional Foreign Aid Bill, Joint Committee May Reach Agreement, Zhou Yide Criticizes U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] China's chances of obtaining temporary and long-term economic assistance from the United States became slightly clearer on the 12th, as two definitive developments emerged on the 12th, showing a glimmer of hope. Representative Zhou Yide said that he believes that after Congress reconvenes on January 6th next year, the State Department will submit a report on China's long-term needs. At the same time, according to friends in Congress with authority to visit, China may receive all of its $60 million in the temporary foreign aid bill, as the joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives has made some compromises, believing that this amount can be issued from other funds.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, which is adjusting the differences in the temporary foreign aid bill passed by the two houses, decided today that $150 million could be advanced by the Development Banking Group and distributed to countries receiving temporary U.S. aid, but did not reveal whether China would share this right with France, Italy, and Austria.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] After the U.S. Senate and House Joint Committee held a meeting to adjust the emergency assistance measures of the Senate and House of Representatives and adjourned without results, Senator Vandenberg said that an agreement is expected to be reached before the evening of the 13th. This move indicates that the possibly accepted revised plan can be included in the final draft. It is reported that the House Republicans have opposed removing aid to China from the bill and restricting emergency aid to France, Austria, and Italy before the Senate has fulfilled the State Department's request for $300 million in aid to China. The compromise bill may: stipulate that the $590 million approved by the House of Representatives be modified to provide assistance to China, or simply state that Congress is willing to establish another aid to China bill as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] U.S. Representative Zhou Yide criticized the U.S. government's policy toward China today, calling it "hands-off." Zhou said that unless the government changes its policy toward China, Congress will question this matter. Some of his colleagues want to know the extent to which the U.S. work in China is being carried out. He also criticized the American Maritime Administration, saying that the agency has not yet delivered ships to China, and the payment for these ships has been proposed and can be paid at any time. Zhou accused the authorities of focusing on Europe in the case and ignoring the situation in the Far East. He believes that the only way to prevent Soviet aggression is to keep it restrained in both Europe and Asia. Zhou concluded by saying that unless the government corrects its policy, Congress will definitely investigate this erroneous diplomatic policy.</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Observing Xinjiang from a Historical Perspective (Part 1) - A Few Suggestions on Rewriting the History of Xinjiang -</h3>
<p>I. To understand Xinjiang, I believe that the prerequisite is to understand its history. At least, there should be a systematic concept of the culture and social evolution of Xinjiang. If we want Xinjiang to have long-term stability and security, we should trust the effectiveness of objective knowledge and work from the root to guide the flow.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that an ideal general history of Xinjiang will be published soon. The philosophical point of view of this general history must be based on the progress of all mankind in the world and the relations between them. In terms of methods, it must be absolutely based on science; in terms of content, it must include all the classical historical materials of China and Islamic countries, as well as the research results of modern Chinese and Western scholars. Only by objectively grasping historical experience in this way can the world perfectly understand Xinjiang, recognize the image of the mainland, and regenerate the long-lost mainland civilization, giving it the new world status it deserves.</p>
<p>Of course, this work is extremely difficult and cannot be accomplished by the knowledge and experience of one or two people. According to the requirements of modern civilization, it is best to establish an international cultural cooperation organization to be responsible for it, so that it can calmly review all the general achievements of geology, geography, anthropology, ethnology, archeology, linguistics, and comparative religion from complex relationships, and then make a comprehensive synthesis. The history of Xinjiang can be introduced to the world with a purely scientific nature that does not carry any emotion. This is a higher ideal. If it is considered difficult, then take the second best approach and invite a group of people to Xinjiang as soon as possible to do some work. These people must have sufficient humility, be able to see the vastness of the world and understand the limits of themselves, and be willing to recognize the completion of their ideal work. At least, they must devote themselves tirelessly to pioneering work. Their readers are not specialized scholars in the world, but people who have a scientific point of view and historical sentiment towards Xinjiang, and the response and awakening of the broad society; as for Xinjiang, they should try to find more original materials, cooperate more with scholars of indigenous ethnic groups, consult more people, and learn the languages and cultures of Islamic countries, in order to establish a foundation of righteousness and an objective spirit in the complex border society, and to open up a path for those who will devote themselves to this in the future.</p>
<p>Although China has an amphibious territory, in the past hundred years, talents have gathered on the coast, and most Chinese people are only "half Chinese." In terms of their cultural potential, they only have half of the maritime nature, and the other half of the continental nature is paralyzed and has no chance to be cultivated and developed. It was not until Japan was defeated and the threat of the treaty ports, which had lasted for a century, was lifted that there was a chance to return to the interior. In the future, if we want to attach importance to the interior in terms of culture, we must first attach importance to Xinjiang, which is the most inland area in the country; because only Xinjiang has the kind of continental atmosphere and spirit that can cultivate a reverse of the atmosphere of wealth and luxury of the Southern Dynasties, and will increase unimaginable vitality and blood in cultural contact, and restore the half of the Chinese that has been paralyzed for a long time. Only Xinjiang is the only bridge between China and the world. If we want to survive in this world, we must walk to the world from this bridge. In the future, China will have to follow others in politics, economy, and society for a long time. Those with ambition must hope that in academics and culture, there can be a spontaneous cultural spirit, a way of being a person and a country that can be proud of, and our own worldview and views on the world order. Therefore, I also feel that the value of engaging in the history of Xinjiang cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>The lifeline of the Xinjiang issue should be entrusted to history, and the discussion of history must be based on the spirit of the times today. Looking around today, from a distance, there are tigers eyeing us covetously, and the country is in a difficult situation; closer, brothers are fighting each other, and refugees are everywhere. It seems that there is not much hope, but the meaning shown by the pointer of the times is not like this. In the distance of historical progress, there are still good times and beautiful scenery to be found, but it depends on whether we have the determination to reach the other shore. Therefore, discussing history becomes a struggle. We must seek a bright path in the struggle, break out of the narrow nets of various small worlds, and move towards the broad road. We must start from the base point of Xinjiang and establish our world spirit and cultural beliefs in all directions. If we can observe and act in this way, then the re-research work of Xinjiang history will not only have its significance of the times, but also become necessary.</p>
<p>Based on this kind of encouragement from the times, I would like to offer a few suggestions for reorganizing the history of Xinjiang:</p>
<p>The civilization of Xinjiang is a part of world civilization, and it must not be developed in isolation but must accept external influences. Therefore, to criticize any historical view involving Xinjiang, it must be done through the influence of the entire world civilization and not just from the perspective of one civilization.</p>
<p>Most of the existing historical materials of Xinjiang are products of the concepts and interests of various civilizations outside Xinjiang. They are all fragmentary impressions of a certain time and place. The boastful arrogance of a small kingdom is mostly unreliable, and after the event, they are even more worthless. Therefore, when sorting out historical materials, it is necessary to very objectively remove their subjectivity and reveal their incompleteness.</p>
<p>Based on the conclusions of comparative research, establish a comprehensive outline, and then place the cleansed data in their proper positions.</p>
<p>II. Four Stages of Xinjiang Civilization</p>
<p>Currently, there are four paths in the world to solve the history of Xinjiang, pointing to China, Islamic countries, the West, and the Soviet Union respectively. As long as we start to study the history of Xinjiang, we cannot avoid encountering these already traditional viewpoints, and it is easier to be unconsciously influenced by them. Therefore, we must firmly establish our position and attitude, and not cling to the past or blindly follow others in our minds, so that we will not fall into the nets of these small worlds. Bravely stand on the overall position of world civilization evolution and expand our broad vision. We must not only observe the history of Xinjiang from this aerial and condescending perspective, but also observe the history of China, Islamic countries, the West, and the Soviet Union with this aerial and condescending objective attitude. Only by doing our best to maintain this detached position can we discover which phenomena are helpful to the progress of the overall strategy, which phenomena are reactionary that hinder the evolution of the whole, and how to achieve the overall welfare of the world, and know what to follow.</p>
<p>When the light of world civilization was still limited to the shores of rivers and inland seas, the civilization of Xinjiang, like the light that appeared in other places, was very small in scope and mostly concentrated along the Tarim River. At this time, because there were few opportunities for various civilizations to interact with each other, they developed into different styles of isolated civilizations. Many ancient traditions and habits that are still preserved in the world today were formed at that time, and there has been no such peaceful environment since then.</p>
<p>Inland river and sea civilization developed to its peak, and various isolated civilizations emerged one after another, opening up territories and forming a surface. Iron soldiers and war horses formed the general trend of Xinjiang being surrounded. The Han civilization in the east, the major Middle Eastern empires and Greco-Roman civilization in the west, the Magadha Kushan Gupta Empire civilization in the south, and the Xiongnu Xianbei Rouran nomadic empires in the north all took the Xinjiang fortress as a hunting ground. In the rapid whirlpool of cultural exchange, Sima Qian in the east and Herodotus in the west first initiated historical writing. The two fathers of history observed Xinjiang from different angles. The naming of "Western Regions" and "countries outside of Yishan" initially formed the most basic classical historical materials of Xinjiang, and Xinjiang began to occupy a position in world civilization.</p>
<p>In this stage, Xinjiang inherited the legacy of Persia and Greece in culture, and adopted the form of reconciliation with the Han in politics. The Han people, who had the chivalrous spirit of the Warring States period, created great undertakings. The work of Duan Huizong in northern Xinjiang and Ban Chao in southern Xinjiang is a typical example of the oasis and grassland systems. Because these Han people had very high organizational abilities, the international armed peace of Xinjiang was also recorded for the longest time.</p>
<p>Nomadic peoples poured out from the remote grasslands in the north in large numbers. In the form of later waves chasing the former waves, they opened up continental transportation. World civilization expanded into a belt at the speed of war horses. A large number of camels and horses invaded Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and India from the lowlands on the north bank of the Caspian Sea, the Herat Gate, and the Iron Gate. Buddhism and Christianity traveled east and west separately. Under the control of the Kushan dynasty, Xinjiang became a part of the Buddhist international. Under the unprecedented prosperity of pantheistic art, scholars of the Sui and Tang empires and the Arab empires continued to write history. From the confrontation between Sima Qian and Herodotus in the past to the confrontation between Sima Guang and Tabari (Arab historian), the Sui and Tang people took Hexi as their base and looked westward; the Arabs took Khorassan as their base and looked eastward; coupled with the prospect of the Tuoba clan and Eastern Roman historians for the pastoral people in the north, the classical historical materials of Xinjiang were extremely splendid and chaotic.</p>
<p>The long-term prosperity of the continental period and the classical traditions of various ancient isolated civilizations have deeply constituted the different perceptions and habitual prejudices and illusions of the old world people towards Xinjiang. The Han people, who retreated to the Yangtze River basin, were still unwilling to give up their concept of the prosperous era and some heroism, legendary spirit, and feudal imperialism based on the Han and Tang traditions. Their attitude was one of expanding towards the mainland, and their historical view was one of continental defense. However, in fact, they had been retreating to the southeast for a long time, and their intellectuals had fallen into a state of complete incomprehension of the major events that had occurred in Xinjiang during the continental period, such as the cultural relics system of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, the Chagatai Khanate, and the Timur Dynasty. On the other hand, since the collapse of the ancient empire, the backward mentality of the historians of various Islamic countries has always been obsessed with the ideal of a large Islamic international, believing that only the Middle East and Central Asia are paradise for civilization, and exerting their isolationism of a small world, forever regarding the heretics and different cultures in other regions of the world as objects of religious and ethnic struggle. However, the continental stage of world history has come to an end, and Columbus, who could not be seen from afar, has landed on the New World. This is the tragedy of being out of touch at that time, the irony of history.</p>
<p>The 19th century was the peak of the oceanic era. At this time, China was even more forced to face the ocean with its back to the mainland in order to save its survival. India and Islamic countries also embarked on the fate of becoming colonies if they did not take the path of capitalism. However, even if their forms have changed, their concepts have not changed at all. They have already fallen far behind in world civilization, but they still want to rely on the remaining glory of the past to demand their historical rights. When Zuo Zongtang of China advanced westward and Sultan Abdol Hamid of Turkey launched his Pan-Islamic movement, they were still looking at Xinjiang from different angles, and they were full of megalomania and exclusion. This is the remote cause of many disharmonious oppositions in Xinjiang today.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must technically thoroughly examine whether the ideas lurking in these four historical views still contain various prejudices of the inland river and sea, continental, and oceanic periods, and estimate whether these remaining prejudices can still cause adverse cultural and social effects; then, we must examine from the opposite side how many subjective traditional factors still exist in Xinjiang society today. We must fearlessly discover it, expose it, and persuade it to promote the early maturity and establishment of a purely objective concept of Xinjiang history, and to awaken and win the scientific spirit that is its prerequisite, and to do our part in pioneering efforts.</p>
<p>In the classical historical materials of China, we must examine those irresponsible heroism, legendary spirit, and feudal commercial nationalistic factors, such as the tradition of the Western Regions concept, Ban Chaoism, and Zuo Zongtangism. Because we estimate that the existence of these concepts will not help to truly promote the sincere unity of the Chinese people, they must be discarded.</p>
<p>In the classical historical materials of Islamic countries, we must examine religious fanaticism and the megalomania and exclusiveness of narrow ethnic nationalism, such as Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, which have fallen behind in the entire world evolution. Because these ideas are not beneficial to truly promoting the freedom, happiness, and liberation of the people of Xinjiang, they can only lead to extreme disconnection and stubbornness.</p>
<p>In the historical materials of Western countries, we must be able to accurately distinguish some opinions that are popular based on scientific pseudoscience, as well as ignorant judgments formed by neglecting the value of other civilizations, such as the sense of superiority that the West is the mother of world civilization, and the rough conclusion that the foundation of Xinjiang civilization must also belong to Aryan civilization and Greek civilization. Because the influence of this kind of scientifically pseudoscientific speech is deeper than that of preaching without scientific training, and it is also harmful to the continued development of speculation and antiquities, it must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>In the historical materials of the Soviet Union, we must both absorb its newer scientific achievements and pay attention to its clever propaganda techniques. This is because the Soviet historical view not only has the characteristic of absolute "monism," but is also using its dogmatic spirit to dominate other thoughts. Although it has all-encompassing content, it does not have the tolerance to respect other civilizations. Before this new historical dynamic, not only will other valuable different concepts be eliminated, but even the good objective spirit will not be allowed to exist. Although we are extremely willing to accept all the valuable scientific contributions of the Soviet Union in thought, we can only use them as one of the mainstream of modern thought and cooperate with them, but we cannot take them as the whole of modern thought and be dominated by them, nor can we admit that the Soviet view is an objective view. This is the limit of our use of Soviet historical materials. At the same time, in essence, we have to admit that the subjectivity of the Soviet historical view is no different from the subjectivity of the classical historical materials of China and Islamic countries.

<h3>Barter Policy with Japan</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) According to the regulations, Japan is a defeated country, and its government and people are not allowed to trade freely with other countries during the occupation period. All Japanese yen should not have an international exchange rate, but its products are urgently needed by the victorious countries. Therefore, the controlling authorities decided to operate under a barter accounting method between the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and the governments of various countries. It is stipulated that this Japanese barter policy is jointly handled by various countries. Since the governments of various countries are in a victorious position, they all want to take goods from Japan, and then gradually pay for them with goods. The faster the goods are obtained and the slower the repayment is, the more beneficial it is. Only the victorious countries can overdraw. Since our country is a neighbor and transportation is easier, the number of imports is also relatively large. For example, 6,190,518 mining timber have been shipped in, and 579,165 railway sleepers have been shipped in, as well as 8,283 boxes of explosives. The coal and electricity supply, which should have been the most panicked after the war, has not had any major problems so far, mostly based on the implementation of this barter. Therefore, the Executive Yuan's decision is of great benefit to economic recovery, because the more goods are obtained, the more beneficial it is to the recovery. At the same time, due to cargo transportation, the excess of imports over exports changes from time to time. According to the recent situation, there is a total debt of approximately several million U.S. dollars to the Allied Headquarters. The reasons are: 1. Our country has been taking goods quickly; 2. In the past year, the export of surplus goods has decreased. If the export is carried out according to the original quantity, not only can the excess of imports be avoided, but also the import volume of industrial equipment can be increased. Recently, the Resource Committee has been shipping iron sand from Hainan Island to Japan through the China Trust Bureau. In terms of barter, if the raw materials lacked by Japan are no longer supplemented, then the copper and iron products needed by the country, such as locomotives and rails, cannot be imported anymore. At the same time, with the export of this iron sand, the China Trust Bureau can negotiate with the Allied Headquarters to have at least half of the goods transported by our country's ships, which will be more beneficial to our country's shipping industry. As for the equipment supplied by the China Trust Bureau to the Resource Committee that has already been delivered, it is worth approximately 510,000 U.S. dollars. The equipment that has been ordered but not yet delivered is worth approximately 560,000 U.S. dollars, totaling 1,170,000 U.S. dollars. This barter will continue next year. The Salt Administration will also supply more surplus salt within the possible scope.</p>
<h3>Suzhou and Wuxi Rice Prices Rise</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 13th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government reported that after the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, commodity prices in the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line have risen sharply. It is actually caused by blind price increases by some illegal merchants. The provincial government has issued a circular to all counties, urging them to adopt effective methods to suppress the price increases. After receiving the order, the county government of this county assigned the Social Affairs Section to cooperate with the police station to be responsible for the implementation. Today, all industries and markets are densely packed with police officers and plainclothes police officers, monitoring transactions. However, the price of rice in the food market continues to rise. The opening price in the morning was 820,000, and there was no standard for the closing price, approximately around 920,000. The future of people's food is obviously quite serious.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 13th] Because of water flooding, transportation difficulties, and withering of rice crops here, Liu Yuan is declining and is willing to lightly sell.

Wheat is opened at 890,000, exceeding the price of rice. Military ship flour is 337,000, edible oil is 1,920,000, rising by 100,000, and other daily necessities are soaring in unison.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Invites Experts to Discuss Stabilizing Prices, Guangzhou Rice Prices Fall, People's Hearts are Settled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 13th] One thousand dollar gold certificates were issued and circulated here on the 12th. The two thousand and five thousand denominations have not yet been transported. In order to prevent the opportunity to raise prices and sell foreign currency, the customs has dispatched inspection teams to earnestly carry out their work. Chairman Song also invited economic experts to discuss effective countermeasures to stabilize prices, including ordering the county governments in rice-producing areas to persuade large households to release surplus grain, and strengthening anti-smuggling work in eastern rice-producing areas. In order to adapt to the actual situation in the city, the prices of major commodities such as flour, oil, sugar, beans, firewood, salt, cotton, and yarn are rigidly regulated, and all futures trading is absolutely prohibited. Following the implementation of the in-kind ration system for public school employees, the system of rationing grain according to the number of people will be promoted, and a subsidy policy will be adopted to set public prices and ration major daily necessities for people's livelihoods. In addition, the Guangdong Food Design Committee is now actively purchasing foreign rice to maintain the food supply for the people, in response to current needs. More than 1,000 large bags of Hubei grain have been transported to Guangzhou, and Hong Kong rice is also being shipped to Guangdong in a steady stream. Therefore, the price of rice has continued to fall in recent days. The price of 100 jin has fallen from more than 1.2 million to more than 800,000. As for the black market for Hong Kong dollars, it has continued to fall due to the tightening of credit, and people's hearts have been settled.</p>

<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Vehemently Criticizes Western Countries' Policy Towards Germany, Tensions Rise, Foreign Ministers' Conference Postponed to Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 13th Broadcast: Due to the fierce dispute on Friday evening, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, originally scheduled to be held today, has been temporarily postponed to next Monday to ease the atmosphere. A member of the US delegation said that if the meeting continued today, it would cause a chaotic scene. Two days of rest can give the four foreign ministers a careful consideration of future actions. Authoritative sources said that the German reparations issue has fallen into an unresolvable stalemate. If the reparations issue is not resolved, other economic issues cannot be discussed. This weekend, Marshall will make a decision on whether to continue the Foreign Ministers' Conference, all depending on Molotov's attitude at the meeting next Monday. It is reported that Molotov is willing to keep the meeting going. A Soviet spokesperson said that Marshall's attitude before the meeting was crucial.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Today's Foreign Ministers' Conference turned into a phase of mutual accusations again. Molotov accused the Western allies of forcing Germany to accept aid without German consent, which is tantamount to acting on their behalf, with the intention of criticizing the Marshall Plan. Most of today's meeting was taken up by Molotov's long speech on the reparations issue. Afterwards, Bevin said: "The way we have been insulted will cause resentment throughout the British Commonwealth." Bidault also said that Molotov's statements were completely contrary to the facts. Marshall said that judging from the purpose of the meeting and the positions of the delegates in their governments, it gives the impression that such procedures will make it difficult to generate respect for the Soviet government. Molotov's statement on the reparations issue contained the following accusations: The three Western delegations' opposition to Soviet reparations is contrary to the attitudes of Yalta and Potsdam; The production in West Germany has fallen into a state of suffocation. The Western countries' suppression of German industry is intended to allow imports to flood into Germany; The export of timber and similar products from West Germany allows foreign bankers and entrepreneurs to profit greatly; Due to the influx of imports into the Western occupation zone, Germany is heavily in debt. It is heard that Germany owes the United States $600 million and the United Kingdom $700 million, which ultimately forces German industry to rely on foreign capital; The Western countries are using West Germany as a base for exerting political pressure on Germany both domestically and abroad, and as a strategic base for anti-democratic countries.</p>
<p>At the beginning of today's meeting, the Soviet Union's proposal to abolish the economic merger agreement of the British and American zones in Germany was first discussed. Molotov said that the three Western occupation zones already have plans for political and economic merger, and France also agreed to this matter. He also said that the division of Germany is becoming increasingly deep, tending towards the despair of establishing a unified Germany. Marshall immediately denied the existence of a merger plan for the three Western zones, and said that the economic merger of the British and American zones was a temporary measure pending the unification of the entire German economy, and that the British and American governments have repeatedly stated their willingness to expand these merger systems to other zones to achieve the unification of the German national economy. Marshall also stated that the merger of the British and American zones was a self-defense measure to prevent the Soviet Union from rushing to transfer the economic resources of Eastern Germany while the British and Americans were properly funding West Germany.</p>

<h3>Out of Jail and Welcomed by an Empty Sedan Chair: A Dispute Over Marriage Contracts and Compensation Heard in Court, with the South Seeking Damages and the Woman Explaining the Reason for Contract Termination</h3>
<p>[Our Own Reporter] Lu Yongshi, a villager from Pudong, became engaged to Wang Azhang's daughter, A Wu, in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). At that time, both parties were underage. All betrothal gifts, including gold hairpins, gold rings, and silver dollars, were entrusted to the matchmaker. Later, when they grew up, they chose to marry in November of the 34th year (1945). Lu prepared a sedan chair, formal attire, phoenix coronet, candles, and a wedding feast for the appointed day. However, at this moment, he suddenly received a letter from a lawyer entrusted by Wang A Wu, canceling the marriage contract. Lu was deeply saddened by this sudden change and estimated that he had already spent over ten million yuan. He then filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting a judgment ordering the return of the gold items and compensation of 11,872,000 yuan, and requesting a declaratory judgment for provisional execution. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Yingqiao of the Seventh Civil Division held a hearing. Both parties engaged in a heated debate in court. Lu claimed that he was detained on criminal suspicion before the wedding and had requested the woman to postpone the wedding date, which was not approved. After being released, he went to pick up the bride as agreed a few days before the wedding. However, Wang refused to get into the sedan chair, resulting in an empty return. The next day, Wang announced the termination of the marriage contract in the newspaper, implying that she was in love with someone else. However, he had already spent a lot of money and requested a judgment ordering the return of the betrothal gifts. According to Wang's statement, Lu's accusations were inconsistent with the facts. Lu was released from prison in the 34th year (1945), and the wedding date was November 21 of the same year. Lu was released from prison only one day before the wedding date. How could he have made preparations in such a short time? She had originally intended to marry, but because the wedding date was mistaken, she announced the termination of the marriage contract in the newspaper. Furthermore, the marriage was arranged by the parents when both the man and woman were underage, and she could legally request the cancellation of the marriage contract. She requested the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. After the conclusion of the arguments by both parties, the court announced that the judgment would be delivered on the 16th of this month.</p>

However, due to the winter season, hot meals have been provided since the day before yesterday, using specially made insulated containers to hold the food. The meal served on the flight the day before yesterday was half a portion of spaghetti with cheese. In the future, noodles and meatballs will be used to cater to the habits of domestic passengers. This approach is currently experimental. If it is well-received by passengers, it will be widely adopted.</p>
<h3>Executive Council for Seized Enemy Assets: Chairman Pan Appointed as Member</h3>

<h3>Impersonating a Messenger to Solicit Tips: Another Attempt Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>Qian Jigen and Bao Haibin, former deliverymen of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, were arrested on August 4 for impersonating messengers and forcibly selling towels. They were handed over to the police station by Xiao Jin'ao, a messenger from the post office, and transferred to the court for detention as a warning. Unexpectedly, after their release, they resumed their old ways, wearing green uniforms and impersonating messengers. On the 5th, at noon, they solicited New Year's tips from residents of the Shanghai New Village on Lin Sen Road and were recognized by Zhai, a messenger from the post office, who handed them over to the Changshu Road Police Station for legal action.</p>
<h3>Living Expenses for Families of Traitors: Stipulation of 10% to % of Total Assets</h3>
<p>[Our Own Reporter] Regarding the punishment of traitors after their sentencing, the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors stipulate that all their assets, except for the necessary living expenses for their families, shall be confiscated. However, there is no clear provision in the law on the standard for determining the amount of necessary living expenses. Therefore, courts have encountered difficulties when executing judgments on traitor cases. The Shanghai judicial authorities have recently received instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stipulating that the standard for the necessary living expenses for the families of traitors shall be 10% to 20% of the total assets. Within this range, the court may consider the number of family members, their age, and their ability to work to make a ruling. In the future, both the confiscation of assets and the provision of living expenses will be based on this standard.</p>

<h3>Brazen Robbers Rob a Jewelry Store and Dare to Arrange a Meeting to Demand Money: Arrested on Time in Front of the Great World and Confess to Planning to Rob Women with Missing Diamonds</h3>
<p>[Our Own Reporter] At 7:00 PM the night before last, the police station arrested a lone robber in front of the Great World. The robber, named Yan Zifei, was 25 years old and from Qiqihar. On the day of the arrest, at 12:00 PM, the robber impersonated an economic section staff member of the local authorities, using the pseudonym Song Chengwei. He went to the Fang Zijin Jewelry Store at No. 386 Henan Road and entered the store under the pretext of investigating the black market for gold and cash. He rushed directly to the second floor, pulled out a pistol, and attempted to extort four large bars of gold without success. He then ordered the manager of the store, Jin Chuxiang, to open the safe and stole the only remaining 2 million yuan. He then forced Jin to follow him out of the store. They walked along Second Mazhong Road, Third Mazhong Road, Guangdong Road, and Shandong Road, negotiating along the way. He instructed Jin to call the store and prepare the money. As a result, Jin promised to hand over six taels of gold, arranged to be delivered at 7:00 PM that night in front of the Great World. After escaping and returning to the store, Jin reported the information to the police station. Section Chief Chen Jinsheng, staff member Li Xiqing, Sun Liting, and Police Officer Hua Jinuo were dispatched by the police chief on time to set up an ambush. At the appointed time, they saw Yan pacing back and forth on the roadside and arrested him.

At the same time, a business card with the pseudonym Song Chengwei was found on his body, with the words "Mrs. Gu, No. 12 Xingan Road" written on the back. After questioning, Yan confessed that he had seen a report about Mrs. Gu losing a seven-carat diamond ring while watching a play at the Cathay Theatre. He therefore recorded the address, intending to rob her when the opportunity arose. Unexpectedly, he was arrested in this robbery case. After verifying the confession, the police station is continuing its investigation.</p>

<h3>Wuxi's Cunning Bandit Chief: You Jugeng Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Own Reporter, Wuxi, 12th] In the case of the kidnapping of Huang Genxiang, owner of the Xiexing Foundry under the Huiban Bridge in the north of Wuxi, it was learned from the confession of wanted criminal Su Xiaoquan and others apprehended by the Criminal Police Brigade that the mastermind behind the case was the notorious bandit chief You Jugeng. The county authorities stated that You had defected from the guerrilla forces to the enemy puppets during the occupation, committed many evils, and had long been wanted for treason. Now, he dared to collude with bandits and commit kidnapping, which was extremely illegal. Therefore, they strictly ordered their subordinates to intensify their efforts to track down and arrest him for investigation. After four months, You was finally captured in Shitang City on the night before yesterday. His accomplice Zhou Shenggen was also arrested on the spot, and a light machine gun and a revolver were seized. Sun Ruyuan and Sun Muji, the landlords who had harbored the bandits, were also taken into custody. You will be interrogated by the Wuxi Command due to his status as a traitor and former collaborator, while the other criminals have been handed over to the police bureau and transferred to the county government for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Former Boatman and Puppet Darling</p>
<p>You Jugeng, a native of Liu Village in the northern part of the county, was originally a boatman before the Anti-Japanese War. When Wuxi fell in the winter of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), he first joined the Sixth Detachment of the Zhongjiu Army under the command of Hui Min and engaged in guerrilla warfare. Known for his bravery, You quickly rose to prominence because he was naturally violent and killed people like grass without blinking an eye. After the deaths of guerrilla leaders You Guozhen and others, You's position in the guerrilla forces in the north became even more important. At that time, an enemy vehicle passed through the north and was intercepted by our guerrillas, and several enemies were captured. The enemy puppets were alarmed but since then the enemy puppets have paid extra attention to the north, with large numbers of enemy troops going to harass the area. As a result, the general guerrilla personnel sought their own way out and transferred to the "New Fourth Army" or the "Peace Army". You also joined the enemy army organ and served as a secret agent. After several activities, he became the puppet chief of the Qianzhou District Police Branch.</p>
<p>Hiding Beauty in a Golden House: Wife and Concubine Both Died</p>
<p>Since taking office, You had unscrupulously plundered the area and had savings in his hands. After having enough food and warmth, he began to think about lasciviousness. You, who was in his prime, had a handsome appearance and liked to flirt with women. He frequented brothels and became acquainted with Chen Yuanyuan, a well-known Pingtan actress. They fell in love at first sight and were deeply devoted to each other. Soon, they rented a house and lived together. However, just as You was feeling triumphant, the enemy police suddenly received information that You was colluding with bandits. He was taken to the troop and tortured to force him to confess. As a result, the enemy police escorted him to the enemy military law office in Shanghai. You's wife, who was also naturally shrewish, witnessed her husband's life being in danger and secretly returned to her hometown, gathering her followers, kidnapping, extorting ransoms, and setting up checkpoints to commit evil deeds. She first had Su Weibin, the director of our underground county government, strangled to death, and then rekindled the flames by shooting Chen Yuanyuan. However, You's wife was soon killed by Su's cousin, resulting in a situation of "he who kills will also be killed."</p>
<p>Committing Evil: Unable to Escape the Grasp of the Law</p>
<p>In the spring of the 34th year (1945), You was released and returned home. His wife and concubine had both died. The mountains and rivers were still the same, but the people were no longer the same. He could not help but feel a sense of regret, so he often traveled between Wuxi and Shanghai. When the enemy troops surrendered, You regained his former prestige, with guards accompanying him in and out. Later, after the Third Front Army arrived in Wuxi, the situation changed. You knew that it would be difficult to gain a foothold in the city, so he retreated to the north and continued to collude with the bandits, regarding robbery as a regular occurrence. Later, because kidnapping was more profitable than robbery, he set his sights on extortion and invited his accomplices to come to the city and kidnap Huang Genxiang of the Xiexing Sand Factory, extorting 70 million yuan before he was redeemed. Later, after the Criminal Police Brigade solved the case, the details of the case became clear. Therefore, the local security authorities stated that You had long been wanted and still dared to mastermind kidnapping, which was a disregard for the law. Therefore, they strictly ordered their subordinates to arrest him and bring him to justice. Now, the arrest and investigation of You has finally been carried out, which greatly pleased the people.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse Discovered in Wuxi: Tied to a Giant Stone</h3>
<p>[Our Own Reporter, Wuxi, 12th] An unidentified female corpse was discovered under the Fanqi Bridge in Tangtou City, north of the city, at 8:00 AM on the 11th of this month. The corpse was approximately 20 years old and was wearing a velvet vest with a printed silk cotton qipao on top, yellow shorts underneath, and was barefoot. The entire body was bound with gray leggings, and a large stone weighing approximately 40 to 50 jin was tied to the chest. The left and right calves were covered with scars, and the facial muscles were severely decomposed. Judging from the circumstances, the corpse had been immersed in the river for about half a month. The township chief Yuan Meilin reported the incident to the local prosecutor's office, requesting an autopsy. After receiving the report, Prosecutor Liu brought a forensic examiner to the countryside for an autopsy. It was determined that the deceased had been strangled to death and then the body had been abandoned in the river. Since there were no family members to claim the body, the government ordered the Tu Zheng (village head) to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Anhui Improves Agricultural Technology: Large-Scale Farms to Be Established</h3>
<p>[Our Own Reporter, Huizhou, 10th] The farming techniques in the agricultural production areas of various counties in the northern and southern parts of the province are mostly old and have not been improved, resulting in a decline in the production of agricultural products and the economic poverty of rural areas. In particular, the frequent floods in the Jianghuai area in recent years have left vast areas of the northeast barren. The provincial government believes that the establishment of large-scale farms is urgently needed and is currently discussing the matter with relevant parties. Once the farm locations are determined, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be requested to send personnel to assist in the design in the short term, and tractors will be used for reclamation in the northeastern Anhui region. At the same time, the provincial relief branch will also establish two cooperative farms in northeastern Anhui. The Executive Yuan will allocate 49 tractors to this province through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for use by cooperative farms and mechanized farms to expand production in agricultural areas. Furthermore, the China Agricultural Bank has issued a letter to the Wuhu branch of the China Agricultural Bank, increasing the loan quota by 1.7 billion yuan for ordinary agricultural loans in this province, including 400 million yuan for production loans, 800 million yuan for extension loans, and 500 million yuan for small-scale water conservancy projects. The provincial government will first allocate the increased production and water conservancy loans to the counties and cities, and then send telegrams to the counties and cities to inform the community that they can directly contact the Wuhu branch for loans. The 800 million yuan for extension loans is still being planned and allocated by the provincial government.</p>
<h3>Jin Deming's Posthumous Affairs: Handled by Friends from His Lifetime</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Bureau, 13th] A bizarre murder case occurred on the 11th at No. 23, Lin, inside the Suzhou Gate. The victims were Jin Deming, a lieutenant attached to the 5th Company of the 1st Battalion of the Xuxian County Regiment Management District, and his wife. The occupants of the house heard nothing when the incident occurred. After committing the crime, the murderer:</p>
<p>Locked the Door</p>
<p>and calmly fled. The deceased's two sons are also missing, making the case confusing and perplexing. Details are as follows: The deceased, Jin Deming, was from Jianyang County, Sichuan, 33 years old. His wife, Zou, was a remarried woman. The couple had a harmonious relationship and had two sons and one daughter. The eldest son is five years old, the second son is three years old, and the daughter was born in April of this year. During the War of Resistance, Jin served as a warrant officer of ammunition in the 1st Battalion of Mortars in the Wan District Garrison Headquarters. He was later promoted to lieutenant platoon leader. After the victory, he was assigned to the 28th Army Officer Corps. In February of this year, he began working in the Xuxian County Regiment Management District. He lived with six other families in a house in front of Baolin Temple. Jin had a batman named Yang Huimin who:</p>
<p>Followed Him Everywhere.</p>
<p>He also slept outside Jin's bedroom at night. Jin was known for his violent temper and often beat Yang. On the evening of the 10th, Jin went to a small restaurant after work to get drunk and watch a movie. He returned home to sleep around 9 p.m. The next day at noon, the other occupants saw that Jin's door was locked. Thinking he had gone out, they initially did not suspect anything. However, when the child cried incessantly, they began to suspect something was wrong. They asked through the door and heard a faint moan from inside. They realized something was amiss and quickly climbed a ladder to look through the window facing the street. They saw Jin and his wife lying in pools of blood. They ran to tell the Baojia chief, who reported it to the police station, the military police, and the regiment management district. They forced the door open and saw Jin's wife lying on the iron bed, with seven axe wounds on her neck, the bloodstains blurred, barely alive. Jin was lying face down on the floor in front of the bed, wearing shorts and barefoot, his head:</p>
<p>Chopped with Eight Axes.</p>
<p>Blood flowed out. He had already died. The bedding on the bed was stained with blood and in disarray, suggesting he had struggled desperately when attacked. The murder weapon, a wood-chopping axe, was hidden under a sheet. The batman, Yang Huimin, and Jin's two sons were missing. The baby daughter was safely lying in the quilt, crying. Only a handbag and a self-defense revolver were missing from the room. The wounded Zou was immediately sent to the Gongqi Hospital for emergency treatment.</p>
<p>All the aftermath of the deceased is now being handled by friends from his lifetime. His young daughter is also being temporarily taken care of by colleagues.</p>
<p>The Critical Situation Today</p>
<p>Jin's Wife Zou's</p>
<p>Condition is Improving. She is now able to speak intermittently. Colonel Du Xu, commander of the regiment management district, and Qian Shulin, captain of the police criminal investigation team, rushed to the hospital ward to inquire about the case after receiving the report, hoping to obtain clues about the murderer and the incident from the victim. However, Zou had seven axe wounds to the head, the front and back of her head, and suffered severe shock at the time, resulting in mental derangement and incoherent speech. Her answers were irrelevant to the questions asked, and nothing was gained. According to Dr. Zhang Lei, deputy director of the hospital, it may take three or four days for Zou to regain her senses.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Handling Express Telegrams and Future Improvement Plans</h3>
<p>— Ji Liang</p>
<p>It has been almost a year since the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau opened express telegram services between Beijing and Shanghai last December, followed by Wuxian, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Yinxian in January and February of this year. At the beginning of the service, citizens praised its convenience, as it was indeed able to achieve "speed," "accuracy," and "convenience," and was praised by all sectors of society. However, in recent times, the demand from users has been increasing daily, and the bureau is limited by the capacity of its machines and lines, which has resulted in frequent suspensions of service. The outside world, unaware of the real situation, seems dissatisfied, but once explained, it is not difficult to understand. Here, I would like to explain the difficulties in handling express telegrams for the reference of all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the only major commercial port in China, and the nation's financial and commercial information all looks to Shanghai for guidance. Most of this information is transmitted via express telegrams. According to statistics, in the early days of the service, the total number of express telegrams sent from Shanghai to various places was only about 300 per day. Subsequently, the number gradually increased, and now it exceeds 1,000 per day, with the most congested routes being those to Nanjing, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Yinxian, especially Wuxi. The direct-circuit telephone lines from the bureau to the above-mentioned locations are sixteen lines to Shanghai-Beijing, eight lines to Shanghai-Hangzhou, seven lines to Shanghai-Wuxi, four lines to Shanghai-Zhenjiang, four lines to Shanghai-都, and three lines to Shanghai-Jiaxing. All of these lines need to be shared equally by the originating and receiving locations. In short, only half of the above numbers represent the telephone lines available for Shanghai to use. Each telephone line can only handle a maximum of six actual calls per hour. Taking Wuxi as an example, only eighteen to twenty calls can be handled per hour. Users call to send express telegrams, and they all concentrate their calls during office hours (from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), hoping to get through within that time. However, the bureau has to consider the connection time limit (ten minutes) and the telephone line capacity, so when there is excessive congestion, it has no choice but to temporarily suspend registration and only continue accepting new users after the registered users have cleared. This is one of the reasons why the service cannot run smoothly. Secondly, 98% of Shanghai's long-distance telephone users are users of the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, with a total of more than 60,000 numbers. According to regulations, each long-distance telephone line should be equipped with a pair of outgoing trunk lines (used by the long-distance exchange to connect to local city lines). Currently, the bureau has a total of seventy wired telephone lines to various parts of the country, three radio telephone lines (to Chongqing, Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, Beiping, Guangzhou, Taipei, Jinan, etc.), and two China-US international radio telephone lines. However, the existing number of outgoing trunk lines, including notice lines, is only sixty pairs, which is far from sufficient, resulting in more than twenty long-distance telephone lines being vacant due to the lack of trunk lines. This is the biggest reason for the congestion. Thirdly, during peak calling hours, the dial tone of city telephones is often very slow, wasting time and affecting the number of long-distance calls that can be connected.</p>
<p>In summary, in order to improve the current long-distance telephone service, the first step should be to increase the number of outgoing trunk lines. The bureau has repeatedly requested the company to increase them, but the company is currently unable to agree due to a shortage of machines and lines and difficulties in applying for foreign exchange. In order to protect the interests of the public, the bureau has established close communication with the company to jointly find ways to solve this difficult problem. Secondly, in order to increase the number of long-distance telephone lines, the bureau has made various preparations. In addition to completing a four-core cable along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line and erecting two pairs of new long-distance telephone poles along the Beijing-Shanghai highway, and installing a large number of carrier-wave telephone machines, it has also ordered dozens of the latest model long-distance console seats from the United States, in order to improve both the "quantity" and "quality" of the service simultaneously. Therefore, in the near future, Shanghai's long-distance telephone service will be able to serve society with a new image.</p>
<h3>Common Sense for Telephone Users</h3>
<p>— Mu Zeng</p>
<p>Just imagine, what would happen in a city like Shanghai if all the telephones in the city suddenly stopped working? All political and commercial contacts would have to be resolved by running errands in person. Not to mention the serious inconvenience caused, the entire activity of the city could simply be paralyzed! In fact, telephone communication has become an indispensable part of urban prosperity. However, although everyone knows the importance of telephones, only a tiny fraction of the city's residents can make full and good use of them. Due to misuse or carelessness, telephone communication suffers unnecessary difficulties in terms of technology or management, which is a loss for both users and the authorities. The purpose of this article is to provide some simple knowledge about telephones (limited to local city telephones), and in our explanations, we will focus on users of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, commonly known as "〇2" telephones.</p>
<p>Shanghai Telephone Zones</p>
<p>Originally, the city's telephone traffic was divided between two organizations: the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, an affiliate of the Ministry of Transportation; and the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company. The former's jurisdiction covered Hongkou, Zhabei, Nanshi, Pudong, the city center, and other areas, while the latter's area covered the old two concessions and the areas beyond the concession boundaries. These two organizations are completely independent and unrelated. Due to the fundamentally different switching systems used by the two sides, intercommunication between the two sides requires cumbersome procedures. In addition, both sides use five-digit numbers, and often the user numbers are similar. For example, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Electric Bureau) has the user number 7〇731 in Nanshi, and the Shanghai Telephone Company (hereinafter referred to as the Company) also has the user number 7〇731, so the chance of misconnections is very high.</p>
<p>Now I will briefly describe the zoning situation of the two sides as follows:</p>
<p>Belonging to the Electric Bureau:</p>
<p>(1) Numbers starting with "5" - the city center area.</p>
<p>(2) Numbers starting with "6" - Hongkou, Zhabei, (north of Wujin Road) 傎茹, Wusong, and other areas. (Hongkou)</p>
<p>(3) Numbers starting with "7" - Nanshi, Pudong, Longhua, and other areas. (Nanshi)</p>
<p>Belonging to the Company:</p>
<p>(1) Numbers starting with "1" - West of Huangpu, south of Suzhou Creek, east of Henan Road, and north of 巾正东路. (Central)</p>
<p>(2) Numbers starting with "2" - the area beyond the Shanghai-West concessions　路区. (Jiangsu)</p>
<p>(3) Numbers starting with "3" - South of Suzhou Creek, east of Fanwangdu Road, north of Zhongzheng Middle Road, and west of Huanghe Road. (West Bureau)</p>
<p>(4) Numbers starting with "4" - North of Suzhou Creek, west of Shajing River, south of Wujin Road, and east of Xizang North Road. (North Bureau)</p>
<p>(5) Numbers starting with "5" - The old concession area east of Shajing River. (Huishan)</p>
<p>(6) Numbers starting with "6" - Some are in the "West" Bureau, and some are in the "Fenyang" Bureau.</p>
<p>(7) Numbers starting with "7" - South of Zhongzheng Middle Road, north of Xujiahui Road, east of Huashan Road, and west of Chongqing South Road. (Fenyang)</p>
<p>(8) Numbers starting with "8" - East of Chongqing South Road, north of Xujiahui Road, west of Minguo Road, and south of Zhongzheng East Road. (Yunnan)</p>
<p>(9) Numbers starting with "9" South of Suzhou Creek, west of Henan Road, north of Zhongzheng East Road, and east of Huanghe Road.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that the city center users of the Electric Bureau may have the same numbers as the Huishan district users of the Company, and the Nanshi users of the Electric Bureau and the Fenyang district users of the Company have equal household numbers.</p>
<p>How to Make a Phone Call</p>
<p>Now we can talk about how to make a phone call. If an Electric Bureau user is calling another Electric Bureau user, or a Company user is calling another Company user, you only need to first hear the dial tone, and then dial the number. After that, wait. If you hear a ringing tone, it means the called user is free and will definitely answer. If you hear a busy tone, it means the called user is busy and you need to wait a while and dial again. Everyone probably knows the above. The problem now is how an Electric Bureau user calls a Company user, and vice versa. If an Electric Bureau user is calling a Company user, you need to listen to the dial tone as usual, and then dial "〇". Then listen for another slightly different dial tone (note, it must be "different". If it is the same, then dial "〇" again). After you hear it, then dial the number you need. After that, things are the same.</p>
<p>Conversely, if a Company user is calling an Electric Bureau user, you also listen to the dial tone as usual, and then dial "〇2". Wait. A female voice will answer you "〇2 What number are you calling?" Then you tell her what number you want. After that, things are also the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, before you make a phone call, you must first determine whether the party you are calling belongs to the Electric Bureau or the Company, and then you can start dialing. To determine which one it belongs to, please check the telephone directory. All those with "　" belong to the Electric Bureau, otherwise they belong to the Company.</p>
<p>Note: Sometimes, before you finish dialing the number, you already hear a busy tone. That means the switchboard is busy and cannot serve you. You can only wait a while and dial again. In short, as long as you hear a busy tone, it is useless to force the dialing (the machine may be damaged because of it!). You can only wait and dial again.</p>
<p>Telephone Obstacles</p>
<p>Anything that is a machine is bound to have the opportunity to experience obstacles. Telephones are no exception. However, when a telephone has an obstacle, the user should also know a little about how to deal with it. Otherwise, it is useless to simply say that the telephone is not working and scold the administration. Good maintenance depends on the cooperation of both the user and the bureau (company).</p>
<p>Obstacles can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is the telephone itself. The symptoms are: you can speak but cannot hear, or you can hear but cannot speak, or there is noise, the sound is too far away, etc. The second category of obstacle is the "cable", that is, the quick line from the user's phone to the machine room in the bureau (company). When a cable has an obstacle, when the user lifts the handset of the phone and listens quietly, they will definitely not be able to hear the dial tone, and when blowing air into the microphone, there will be no feeling in the handset. (Normally, when the line is normal, blowing air into the microphone can be heard in the handset.) The third category of obstacle lies in the machine in the bureau (company). If the user hears a special strange noise when listening quietly in the handset, the obstacle may belong to this category.</p>
<p>The above classification is just a rough method of identification. In fact, obstacles cannot be determined without detailed mechanical testing. However, when an obstacle occurs, users should never act clever and repair it themselves, because blind action will not only fail to repair the original obstacle, but will also add new obstacles!</p>
<p>When a user encounters an obstacle, the first step is to notify the bureau (company). If it is the Electric Bureau, then call "1〇1" (or report directly to the bureau). The operator on duty will immediately test it and then decide on the steps for repair. If it belongs to the Company, then call "〇1", and there will definitely be the same response. The repair date may be the same day, or it may take several days, depending on the severity of the obstacle. (Users have a kind of mentality, often wanting it to be repaired immediately after reporting it, but in fact, this is sometimes technically impossible.)</p>
<p>Telephone Maintenance</p>
<p>Finally, we need to talk about how to maintain a telephone. The responsibility for maintenance is of course the responsibility of the bureau (company) authorities, but users also have a little maintenance obligation. In other words, as long as users use it carefully and properly, it will not only save the bureau (company) many unnecessary repairs, but also improve the efficiency of telephone communication. Now, I will state the points that ordinary simple users should pay attention to when maintaining a telephone:</p>
<p>(A) Keep the telephone away from moisture. "Electricity" is most afraid of moisture, so it is best not to bring tea water and other things close to the telephone. Rainy days are also enough to cause the telephone to malfunction.</p>
<p>(B) Do not move the telephone too much (like dropping it, bumping it, etc.).</p>
<p>(C) When dialing, when the finger hole is turned back, do not force it back to its original position with your finger. Forcing it back will damage the dial and make the dialing inaccurate.</p>
<p>(D) Do not arbitrarily tap or press the "hook" (i.e., the thing that holds the handset).</p>
<p>(E) Do not disassemble the telephone and carry out unnecessary repairs.</p>

<h3>Introducing Social Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Tao Yong</p>
<p>As the New Year approaches, using social telegrams as gifts is the most economical, fastest, and most generous.</p>
<p>"Social Telegrams" are not a new service. They were opened long before the War of Resistance, but military communications were frequent during the war. The telephone line capacity of various locations was insufficient, and they had to be suspended. After the victory, the telecommunications business returned to normal, and they were restored first in special bureaus and first-class bureaus starting on January 1, 1947. Because "Social Telegrams" have many advantages and conveniences, they have gradually attracted the attention of the Chinese people, especially in this year of economy. It is not only uneconomical to use physical objects to celebrate or mourn. Furthermore, if friends and relatives are far away, it is inconvenient to send gifts, and social telegrams can solve these difficulties. In addition to congratulatory telegrams, you can also attach gift certificates, which can be described as "economical and fast" and "beautiful and generous."</p>
<p>What kinds of things belong to "Social"</p>
<p>The scope of "Social Telegrams" is very wide. Generally speaking, there are congratulations, condolences, condolences, welcomes and farewells, thanks, etc. Congratulations are the most common type, including weddings, birthdays, births, ceremonies, commemorations, openings, and New Years.</p>
<p>Where to Send Them</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's main business office (70 Fuzhou Road) and several demonstration business offices (25 Changzhi Road, 59 Zhongshan South Road) all accept this type of telegram.</p>
<p>Fees and Word Count</p>
<p>"Social Telegrams" are a type of discounted telegram, charged at half the price of ordinary telegrams (500 yuan per Chinese character, 1,000 yuan per English word), and the telecommunications bureau can translate the text without charging a translation fee. Each telegram is calculated starting with 20 Chinese characters or 10 English words. In other words, each telegram costs at least 10,000 yuan. If you choose to use ready-made phrases prepared by the bureau, they are only calculated as eight characters. As for the recipient's name and address and the sender's signature in the text, they are also calculated according to the number of characters. In this way, in addition to the eight-character idiom in the telegram, there are at least twelve characters that can be written, and the cost will not exceed too much.</p>
<p>Ready-made Phrases for You to Choose From</p>
<p>"Social Telegrams" are different from ordinary telegrams. The paper is glossy and larger, with "Social" (SLT) printed on it as a payment mark. The back is printed with ninety-four pre-written phrases of various natures for you to choose and use. The phrases are elegant and meet practical needs.</p>
<p>Beautiful, Generous, and Meaningful</p>
<p>The incoming telegram paper for "Social Telegrams" is specially made, divided into scarlet and blue. Except for condolence matters, which use blue, all the others use scarlet. The paper quality is real, the printing is exquisite, and the patterns are beautiful, enough to arouse the other party's goodwill. For example, if your friends and relatives get married in another city, send a "Social Telegram" within a few hours before the wedding ceremony. It can be delivered in no time. In addition to joy, when the other party receives that pink, more delicate and gorgeous congratulatory telegram paper than a gift certificate, they will feel extra joy. It is more interesting and meaningful than a couplet or a congratulatory banner. Besides, a couplet or a congratulatory banner sent to friends and relatives in remote areas will take several days to arrive! "Social Telegrams" can not only overcome the difficulty in time, but also solve the unnecessary waste of money, making the other party feel novel and satisfied. Therefore, it is an indispensable tool in modern social occasions and a new toy for people who value social interaction.</p>
<p>Attaching a Gift Certificate is Like Cash</p>
<p>There is also a special convenience in sending "Social Telegrams": if you want to give a gift to the other party, the gift money does not need to be remitted by the bank. Just attach the "Social Telegram" gift certificate. The gift certificates range from 10,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan. In addition to the telegram fee, regardless of the amount of the gift money, each telegram only charges a handling fee of 3,000 yuan. In this way, you can save a remittance fee or postage fee. When the receiving bureau receives a social telegram with a gift certificate attached, it will send the gift certificate or cash when delivering the telegram, without the need for the recipient to come and pick it up themselves. It is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>New Social Tricks</p>
<p>"Social Telegrams" can also be sent handwritten, and the price is 20% cheaper than ordinary handwritten telegrams. The other party will especially value it when they see the handwritten text. It can also be sent with gift certificates attached. This method has been implemented in Beijing and Shanghai since December of this year. There is also a special "congratulatory telegram" in "Social Telegrams" dedicated to congratulating the newly elected National Assembly representatives, and the price is also reduced by half.</p>
<p>Currently Open Locations</p>
<p>"Social Telegrams" are now open in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Tangshan, Kunming, Guilin, Xi'an, Guiyang, Changsha, Nanchang, Guling, Hengyang, Chongqing, Chengdu, Qujiang, Wanxian, Luxian, Yibin, Hechuan, Neijiang, Guangyuan, Shantou, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Xiamen, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Yinxian, Yongjia, Xuzhou, Yixing, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Taipei, and other 41 locations. Except for Guangzhou and Taipei, gift certificates can be attached to all the others.</p>
<h3>Special Express Telegram</h3>
<p>— Jun Zhong</p>
<p>Among all kinds of telegrams, the fastest and most accurate is the special express telegram. Sending a special express telegram, compared to an urgent telegram of the same length, only costs an additional 8,000 yuan for the "special express delivery fee." However, in terms of speed and effectiveness, it is more cost-effective than an urgent telegram. It guarantees delivery to the recipient within one and a half hours. In any situation, the telecommunications bureau gives special treatment to special express telegrams. Senders and receivers have the right to priority delivery and sending, free proofreading, and a guarantee of absolute accuracy. After the sending bureau transmits the telegram, the receiving party must send back a "receipt confirmation," so "loss" is simply impossible.</p>
<p>The word "Special Express" should be clearly written on the application form for a special express telegram. Recently, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has been designing a special "Special Express Telegram Application Form" to make it more conspicuous.</p>
<p>The areas this type of telegram can reach are relatively limited. It requires a direct circuit between the sending and receiving bureaus and can only be opened when work is not congested. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau can reach the following locations: Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Taipei, Chongqing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Yinxian, and others!</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Sparks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has added another 30,000 Chinese telegram registration numbers, from 540001 to 569999. Telegram registration numbers will now be sufficiently available, and no registration is needed.</p>
<p>Special express telegrams will continue to be available to Xi'an, Nanchang, Yongjia, and Wuhu from December 1st.</p>
<p>Telephone bills for all Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau "02" telephone users can be collected at all branch offices.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Common Sense Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Lecture 3: How to Choose Special Services (Continued)</p>
<p>Distribution: When a factory has a new product or a specially appointed distributor has a new product on the market, if telegrams can be used to introduce and recommend them to distributors in various regions, the recipients will definitely feel sincerely cared for and be happy to accept. At a time of fluctuating prices, if manufacturers or wholesalers can promptly inform distributors in various regions of new prices after each adjustment by telegram, it will surely make the distributors feel well-served and enhance their trust. Speaking of this, some may ask: The cost of sending telegrams is much higher than printing leaflets or placing newspaper advertisements. If dozens or hundreds of telegrams are sent at once, the cost would be quite considerable. How can we afford it! Well, please hold on! Here, I am going to introduce you to the most economical and practical method of sending multiple telegrams with identical wording, which is to use the special distribution service. If you can grasp the knack of using the special distribution service, it is equivalent to holding the key to developing business and increasing sales power.</p>
<p>Here, let's take a simple example to illustrate the use of the special distribution service: Suppose there is a large-sized soap factory in Shanghai that has just released a new "Telephone" brand soap. When it first enters the market, it can first find out and compile a list of the names and addresses of the distributors in various regions who usually order the most goods from the factory, and then send a telegram using the special distribution service to each region, listing the names and addresses of each distributor located in the same place (if the recipient has a telegram registration number at the local telecommunications bureau, the recipient's name and address can also be replaced with the telegram registration number), and write "Distribute (Number of Copies)" or TM... (Number of Copies) at the beginning of the telegram, for example: TM3 Hankou = Zhongshan Road (15) Huazhong Company = Zhongzheng Road (24) Hankou Store = Jianghan Road (181) Dazhonghang = (Text and sender's signature). Or: TM3 0022 = 3352 = 1129C Hankou = (Text and sender's signature) = Assume that the above three sets of codes are the telegram registration numbers of Huazhong Company, Hankou Store, and Dazhonghang.</p>
<p>After receiving this telegram, the Hankou Telecommunications Bureau immediately copies it into three copies and delivers them separately to Huazhong Company, Hankou Store, and Dazhonghang, and each copy only copies the recipient's name and address in one place, that is, the copy sent to Huazhong Company only writes Huazhong Company in the recipient's name and address, and does not include the names and addresses of Hankou Store and Dazhonghang, and so on for the copies sent to Hankou Store and Dazhonghang. This can allow the sender to maintain commercial confidentiality. If the sender, due to special needs, requests the Hankou Telecommunications Bureau to completely record the names and addresses of all the recipients listed in each distributed copy of the telegram, that is, the sender wants each recipient to be able to see which recipients the telegram is distributed to, just add "Complete Record" or CTA after the distribution identifier, and the telecommunications bureau can do so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are preparing to send a very time-sensitive urgent telegram to an important person who lives in Chongqing and holds several positions, assuming that the recipient's current positions are the director of Tianxing Chemical Factory, the general manager of Xinda Department Store, and the president of the local Chamber of Commerce, he has to take turns going to the above three places every day. Sometimes he has to return to his own residence, and the distance between the factory, company, chamber of commerce, and residence is very far. If you send the telegram to the factory and the telegram arrives when he is working at the department store, or if you send the telegram to the chamber of commerce and the recipient has just returned to his residence, a slight miscalculation will cause a delay. In this case, you can also choose the special distribution service, and completely list the same recipient's multiple addresses in the same place (if there is a telegram registration number, the registration number can be used to replace the name and address), and add "Distribute (Number of Copies)" or TM... (Number of Copies) at the beginning of the telegram, for example:</p>
<p>TM4 Chongqing = Wang Tianyi, Hualongqiao Tianxing Chemical Factory = Wang Tianyi, Xinda Company, Zhongshan 1st Road (58) = Wang Tianyi, Municipal Chamber of Commerce = Wang Tianyi, Liangfuzhi Road (38) = (Text and signature)</p>
<p>After receiving this telegram, the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau immediately copies it into four copies and sends them to the four addresses listed above. In this way, when the telegram arrives, the recipient can receive the telegram immediately no matter where he is.</p>
<p>Telegrams using the special distribution service are charged as one telegram regardless of how many copies are distributed. The number of words in the names and addresses of each recipient listed in the telegram are all counted and charged according to the actual number of words, and an additional distribution fee is charged. The current distribution fee is 2,500 yuan for each copy of less than 50 words (equivalent to the telegram fee of two and a half words for ordinary Chinese language telegrams), and an additional 2,500 yuan is charged for each additional one to fifty words. This low cost is even less than the cost of buying an envelope and stationery plus postage for a regular letter! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ethnic Border Disputes: Local Chieftain Demands Self-Management of National Muli Elementary School</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xichang Air Dispatch] Muli, located in southern Xikang Province, has always been known for its mystery. Not long ago, a conflict arose between the National Muli Elementary School and the local chieftain over enrollment issues. The Xichang Garrison Command sent personnel to Muli to investigate and handle the matter together with the school principal and the chieftain's representative. They have now returned to Xichang. According to the investigators, "Muli" is not as mysterious as people generally imagine. It is best for outsiders to have an acquaintance to introduce them when doing business. Otherwise, as long as they do not violate the rules of "no smoking," "no drinking," "no gambling," and "no stealing," they can still travel freely. Muli has a total of 8,000 households and a population of over 40,000, with Han Chinese accounting for about one-third, and the rest being Xifan, Miao, Yao, Tibetan, Tuban, and Luo. However, most of them can speak fluent Chinese. Muli has three major scripture halls, where Chieftain Xiang Songdian Chunpin rotates, living in each scripture hall for only one year. The scripture hall is the place where all orders are issued, like a government, and the chieftain has supreme authority, and the security situation is good. The chieftain employs a Han Chinese secretary to handle foreign documents and letters, and the documents still use the feudal title "Muli Pacification Commissioner." According to the investigation, the chieftain requested them to report to the government: The Muli Elementary School should be handed over to the chieftain for self-management. The current principal should be replaced.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball Showdown: Transportation Automotive vs. Dagong at 7:00 PM at the City Gymnasium; No Tickets Available in the Afternoon to Avoid Crowds</h3>

<p>The visiting team has had smooth sailing, and under the leadership of veteran Wang Shixuan and Captain Jia Zhijun, their strength is impressive and worthy of appreciation. The Dagong Team is newly formed, gathering the elite of Qunsheng and Zhenglun, and has a momentum of catching up. Tonight's meeting is a touchstone for both sides to test their strength and should be a wonderful battle.</p>

<h3>Qingbai Defeated: Transportation Automotive Unleashes Lightning Tactics; 64 to 44</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] In its third game last night, the Transportation Automotive 16th Regiment Basketball Team met the new force Qingbai, a veteran group. The gymnasium was packed with 3,000 spectators, making it watertight. It was expected to be a very interesting game. The former had the natural physical strength, while the latter relied on human experience and technology. The facts were contrary to expectations, and it was not exciting at all. Qingbai was defeated by Transportation Automotive under irresistible circumstances. Transportation Automotive took the lead with 30 to 20 in the first half, and the final result was 64 to 44, a difference of 20 points. The most significant contrast between the two teams was that Qingbai's shooting was unskilled, while everyone in Transportation Automotive could shoot. Qingbai's cooperation was not pure, and when defending, they used zone defense, with many loopholes. Except for Cai Yanxiong, Zhuo Guorong, and Zhang Shaoqing, the rest had lost their former skills. In the second half, Transportation Automotive saw that victory was in their grasp and was psychologically calm, further increasing the accuracy of their shooting. Transportation Automotive relied on its physical advantage, and its fast lightning tactics were very exciting. Yesterday, Transportation Automotive used a completely native team, and the battle was better than in the past.</p>

<h3>National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee: Members and Advisors Selected; Management Implementation Rules Also Drafted</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Management Implementation Rules of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee have been drafted by Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, together with relevant parties. Within a day or two, Yuan will personally take them to the central authorities for discussion and approval, so that the establishment of the committee can be deployed.</p>
<p>The candidates for members and advisors of the Control Committee were also received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday. The members are Yuan Liang, Liu Siying, Liu Gongyun, Gu Minquan, Hu Jingliang, Wang Lansheng, and Liu Wenteng, with Yuan Liang concurrently serving as the chairman and Liu Siying concurrently serving as the vice chairman. The advisors are Dong Yinzhang, Li Shengbo, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai, and Seventeen others.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Control Committee, it will inevitably need to recruit a large number of control and executive personnel. However, it is difficult to recruit them at once, so there is a strong intention to borrow existing personnel from various branches of the Textile Construction Company across the country, adopting a proxy operation method. It is said that the Textile Construction authorities believe that control and business are different, and those who are good at business may not be good at executing control policies, so they have expressed hesitation to accept the proxy operation.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices See Another Rise; Fabric Buying is Very Active</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, yarn prices rose again. The Textile Adjustment Committee specially sold yarn at the cotton yarn market on an ad-hoc basis. As a result, a total of 157 households were approved to purchase, and a total of 112 lots of yarn were sold, comprising 1354 lots of 20-count yarn. The listed prices were also slightly higher than before.</p>
<p>20-count Jincheng yarn was 31.2 million yuan. 20-count Five Sons, Sailboat, Andromeda, Golden Rooster, and New Sanduo were 30.7 million yuan. 20-count Red Bee, Prosperity, and Gold Ingot were 30.3 million yuan. 6-count was 15.4 million yuan, 32-count was 40 million yuan, 40-count was 42.8 million yuan, and 42-count double-ply was 49 million yuan.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw weaving factories absorbing at low prices, and out-of-town merchants also made purchases, pushing prices up frequently. The best price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn reached 50 million yuan. At 11:30 AM, Fangjian Textiles relisted, accepting applications from fellow businesses, with 20-count yarn being the majority. Allocation involved as many as 14 types, and the market turned soft and weak. Many were floating high, selling to realize profits, and prices hardened slightly near the close. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn soared to 49.2 million yuan, a sharp increase of 2 million yuan compared to the previous day. The price increases for various grades of 40-count yarn were even more intense, ranging from 1.56 million to 3 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn all rose by 1.1 million to 1.45 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton fabric market saw broad and dispersed trading at the opening in the morning, with stable prices. Subsequently, due to significant absorption by shop owners and purchases by out-of-town merchants, dyeing factories showed considerable interest in low-end fine cloth. Powerful players quickly made purchases, strengthening the buying momentum, and the market took off. Towards the end, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, all continued to rise by 20,000 to 50,000 yuan. Dragon Head fine cloth, to be delivered on Monday, was traded at a high of 1.37 million yuan. Other bleached coarse cloth, colored cloth, serge, and straight tribute cloth also showed strong performance in the market.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Abolishing Official Exchange Rates are Purely False</h3>
<p>Adjusting Market Exchange Rates is Also Impossible</p>
<p>The National Economic Council recently approved that foreign exchange for essential imported goods such as rice, wheat, flour, cotton, coal, and fertilizer will be settled at posted market prices. It is expected to be implemented soon after approval by the State Council. However, yesterday, rumors suddenly spread here that the authorities would abolish official exchange rates and thoroughly adjust market exchange rates, causing considerable agitation.</p>
<p>According to a committee member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund, the above rumors are completely inaccurate. The import situation of the aforementioned materials is special. For example, cotton includes relief cotton from the Cotton Control Administration, loan cotton signed between the National Bank and Citibank, and cotton swapped with India for yarn, all of which are controlled by the government and do not require the consumption of official exchange rates.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the establishment of the council, no one has applied to purchase the above-mentioned import foreign exchange. The so-called abolition of official exchange rates is purely groundless. The thorough adjustment of market exchange rates is also factually impossible and will definitely not happen, he said.</p>
<h3>Money Market Remains Tight</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market remained tight, with private lending rates at 2.4%. The four banks and two bureaus had a net deficit of 95.1 billion yuan.

Large clearing outflowed 45.9 billion yuan, foreign firms inflowed 54.7 billion yuan, small clearing outflowed 103.9 billion yuan, and Chinese firms outflowed 80.4 billion yuan.</p>

<p>Sudden Ups and Downs in the Process; Chinese Stocks Fluctuated</p>
<p>The situation of Chinese stocks yesterday was chaotic. With rumors of the opening of foreign exchange, buyers and sellers held their own views. Outside speculative funds were being absorbed, but powerful groups were actively selling off-market and even taking short positions. The process experienced sudden ups and downs. Except for China Porcelain Enamel delivery shares, which suddenly closed at the limit-up, the rest experienced mixed ups and downs.</p>
<p>The morning opening was weak due to reports of the US President having a 300 million yuan aid plan for China. Yong Yarn opened at 443 yuan and 456 yuan. Immediately after opening, there were rumors of favorable buying, which immediately pushed prices up to 457 yuan for spot and 472 yuan for delivery. Subsequently, with many closing positions, prices fell again to 440 yuan and 450 yuan. Off-market interest rates remained unchanged at 2.55% and 3%. When prices reached 450 yuan and 460 yuan, a certain group sold off-market, and there were rumors of short selling, causing prices to fall to 437 yuan and 446 yuan. Later, they rebounded by more than ten yuan, but soon were forced down again. The situation was chaotic, with all parties fighting with all their strength. The noon close was 442 yuan and 454 yuan. China Porcelain Enamel delivery shares closed at the limit-up, and Commercial Press new shares closed at a high price, rising higher than before the capital increase.

<p>Scarce Woolen Fabric Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, woolen fabric transactions were not numerous. Large wholesale customers rarely came and went, and retail business in stores also became quiet. Although there were various favorable buying news for standard prices, due to sluggish actual sales and tight money supply, they could only maintain the status quo. Plain, thick woolen overcoat fabrics, melton, etc., showed signs of stability and slight decline as actual sales had passed the halfway point.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Sells Fabric</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market saw firming trend, but due to tight money supply and inability of buyers to turn over capital, most transactions were shelved. Transactions were not numerous, and prices did not fluctuate much. The total daily turnover was 670 bales.</p>
<p>Soaps Soar</p>
<p>Yesterday's soap market saw prices soaring due to expensive raw materials. Merchants rarely sold together. The supply of spot goods on the market was insufficient.

<h3>Since the Issuance of Large Denomination Notes, Export Commodity Prices Have Remained Stable; Export Situation Has Not Yet Improved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the issuance of the 1,000-yuan Customs Gold Unit notes, the prices of China's export commodities have not risen sharply. The prices of these commodities have always been based on the Central Bank's posted foreign exchange rate, and since the latter has not changed, prices have been able to remain stable temporarily.</p>
<p>Regarding the current export situation, Zhang Yaozhang, secretary-general of the local Import and Export Association, told reporters: Due to the political situation and the inflation situation, there has been no improvement in exports. The exchange rate adjustment provided some assistance at the time, but it is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>There are high domestic expectations for cotton cloth exports, but recently, Japan and India have established a barter agreement. The rupee price of Japanese cotton cloth is lower than that of domestically produced cotton cloth. For example, the Japanese Dragon Head fine cloth is only equivalent to 39 rupees, while the domestic cloth is above 40 rupees, which will inevitably cause difficulties for our cotton cloth export plan.</p>
<p>Seafood Holds Firm</p>
<p>Recently, merchants in the seafood industry stated that the digestion of various goods this month has been exceptionally smooth. There has been a lot of trading in the market, and the market has been soaring. Yesterday, shark fins soared to 100 million Customs Gold Units per dan, followed by squid, which also rose by 14-15 million yuan, dried scallops by 54-55 million yuan, sea cucumber top bald by 25-26 million yuan, and flower vase sea cucumber by 14 million yuan. Other Wen Kaiyang, Golden Hook Tail, Thick Mushrooms, and Fragrant Mushrooms also showed consistently strong performance.</p>
<p>Another report: Among North-South goods, walnuts, red and black dates, longan, vermicelli, and dried bamboo shoots had the best sales. Xiang Lian lotus seeds were even more actively sold, with prices reaching 3.6 million yuan, Longkou vermicelli at 6.5 million yuan, and the prices of other goods also followed suit, rising.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Decides on Artificial Silk Allocation Price Next Week</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's artificial silk meeting on the 13th decided on the artificial silk list prices for the third week from the 15th to the 20th as follows: (A) Toyo brand: A 75.6 million yuan per case, A 74.08 million yuan, A 71.82 million yuan, A 68.04 million yuan. (B) Sky Bridge brand: A 75 million yuan, A 73.5 million yuan, A 7.12 million yuan, A 6.75 million yuan.</p>
<p>(C) Golden Three Horses and Early Day brands: A 7.6 million yuan, A 7.31 million yuan, A 7.088 million yuan, A 6.714 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank Bureau Cotton Mortgage - Four-Agency Jointly Request Chairman's Approval</h3>
<p>This time, the National Bank Bureau was ordered to stop various loans, which has had a significant effect on stabilizing commodity prices and stabilizing the market. According to a responsible person from the Central Bank, the direct effects of this stoppage are twofold: 1. Reducing new buyers; 2. Increasing sellers, so prices can be balanced.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is understood that this time, the stoppage of loans by the Bank Bureau also includes mortgages on cotton and flour. Whether to restore them will be jointly requested by the Four-Agency Headquarters for the Chairman's approval. The Bank Bureau has carefully considered and is working on mortgage on export commodities so that export commodities can be exported steadily in exchange for foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Fishing Industry</h3>
<p>In the vast ocean shrouded in mist, in China's fishing grounds spanning over 8,600 kilometers, on one side are wooden boats with sails dotted here and there, waiting for fish with nets, and on the other side are fishing vessels riding the waves, manipulating the lives of aquatic creatures. The former is the hard work of private fishing companies, and the latter is the new-style equipment of the Relief Administration's Fisheries Management Office. Under this stark contrast, private fisheries have finally issued a desperate cry. The disparity in production processes has caused today's conflict between the two.</p>
<p>Private fisheries are demanding to be allocated fishing vessels to reduce unloading volumes; however, the Fisheries Management Office believes that they do not yet possess the technology to operate new-style fishing vessels, and reduced cargo volumes are enough to threaten the people's food supply. Private fisheries also believe that if mass production causes fish prices to fall to the point where they almost become the staple food of the citizens, their fate will be unimaginable; however, the Fisheries Management Office disagrees with this statement from the perspective of focusing on citizen nutrition.</p>
<p>The dispute will eventually be resolved properly. Here, we first introduce several realistic scenes of the fishing industry under contrasting production methods to the readers!</p>

<h3>Western Bedbugs</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>"The West also has bedbugs," which means that even though our Republic of China is lacking in this aspect and not good in that aspect, Western countries are not as flawless as pure jade. Just as China has its inherent bedbugs, how can the West not have them? This is quite right. For example, China had one revolution and two revolutions, and how could Western countries not have them, and even had them earlier than us, and got rid of more lives than us. We have civil wars that are criticized by the world. Is the American Civil War an external war? We occasionally have one or two officials who are slightly corrupt in their spare time, and American journalists point their fingers at our foreheads and criticize us loudly. But as the Bible says: "Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye?" It is not wrong for us to say that there is a log in the eye of the United States. Just take a look at history, and you will know the corruption and exploitation of officials during the American Civil War, which is like the log and the speck mentioned by Jesus compared to us.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fact that the West also has bedbugs and scoundrels is an undeniable historical fact. The question is why, although the West has bedbugs, the sheets are not as blood-stained as ours. The reason for this is that, first, Western bedbugs are bedbugs, and people are people. The two are not the same. Therefore, the second reason is that people catch bedbugs when they are bitten by them or see them, catching more and more and reducing them, until they are almost non-existent.</p>
<p>But it seems that China is not like this. First of all, people and bedbugs seem to be indistinguishable. In other words, people are bugs, and bugs are people. All animals that get into bed, those who were originally bedbugs are still bedbugs. Even those who were not originally bedbugs have a tendency to become bedbugs. Therefore, despite pointing fingers and scolding bedbugs under the bed, they are unwilling to catch them. After getting into bed, they are even more naturally assimilated by the bedbugs. As a result, there are more and more bedbugs, and over time, the whole room is full, not just the bed.</p>
<p>Therefore, we don't have to and shouldn't scold the bedbugs, because we ourselves are candidate bedbugs.</p>
<h3>The American Soldier's Enthusiasm for Becoming a Monk</h3>
<p>— Liang An</p>
<p>The United States today is a place with the most developed material civilization and the most abundant enjoyment of life; however, a large number of Americans abandon the prosperity of the world every year and go to quiet monasteries to live a simple and hard religious life. Among the Catholic orders, the "Trappist" is the most austere and disciplined. In recent years, however, there has been a particularly large number of people going to American "Trappist" monasteries. The Our Lady of the Prairies Monastery in Rhode Island, USA, recently admitted 35 monks, 25 of whom are American soldiers on expedition. In the other four "Trappist" monasteries in the United States, there are also many people applying for admission. The number of soldiers on expedition is also very high. War shakes people's humanity, and soldiers on expedition on the front lines are more sensitive to religion, so it is understandable that they go to monasteries to seek peace after returning from the expedition. According to the abbot of the Our Lady of the Prairies Monastery, the story of one of the expeditionary soldiers joining their monastery is as follows: "When I was on the front line, we learned night patrols and terror, and we also learned to pray. It was at this time that I decided to accept the "Cistercian" life; I lay on my side in a shallow "foxhole," and when bullets screamed over our heads and exploded, I heard a child constantly chanting "God, God!" ... I felt that my faith was not strong enough, and my faith and love were not enough. So I prayed to the Virgin Mary, asking her to protect me, and promising her to join the "Cistercian" Society to learn charity. She protected me, and I also joined the "Cistercian" Society."</p>
<h3>The Creator of Chaos</h3>
<p>A lawyer, a doctor, an architect, and a communist - four people argued about which of the four careers was the oldest and had the longest history.</p>
<p>The lawyer said, "Of course it's us lawyers. If there is no law to govern everything in this world, how could mankind have gotten along until today?"</p>
<p>The doctor sneered and said, "Don't forget that if there were no obstetricians, Adam and Eve's descendants would not have been born."</p>
<p>The architect leisurely took a puff of his cigarette, pushed up his glasses and said, "You're talking nonsense. The universe was initially just a chaos, and gradually, making chaos into an orderly structure of various buildings is the merit of the architect!"</p>
<p>The communist had been drinking and remained silent at first. When he heard this, he laughed loudly. He shouted, "That's right, the universe was initially just a chaos! But who created this chaos?" (Wind)</p>
<p>It turns out that the so-called "Trappist" is originally named after the "La Trappe Abbey" built by the "Cistercian" order in Normandy, France. In the 17th century, this monastery made some changes to the rules they followed, advocating strict adherence to the rules; therefore, they were called the strict observance sect of the Cistercian order, which in English is called (Cistercians of the Strict Observance). Therefore, it is simply called the "Trappist" or "Trappist" sect. According to their rules, they have to get up at 2:00 AM every day, and even earlier on Sundays and other major holidays. They can only sleep for seven hours every day, spend about seven hours on spiritual practice and prayer, one hour for meals, four hours for reading and personal prayer, and five hours for labor. Except for illness and recuperation, they do not eat meat, eat fish, or even eat eggs; therefore, they are famous for making cheese. Except for talking with the abbot, or being designated by the abbot to direct work, they are not allowed to talk to each other. Therefore, they should be the people who understand silence the most.</p>
<p>In China, there is also a "Trappist" monastery, which is the "God Hall Monastery" in Yangjiaping, Huailai County, Chahar Province. According to statistics in 1940, there were 11 Chinese monks and 13 foreign monks there. In the barren north of the pass, they are living a silent religious life.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of the World</h3>
<p>In the British Parliament's gazette, ordinary members are called "Honorable Members", members who have served in the military are called "Honorable and Brave Members", and members who have served in the military and also practiced law are called "Honorable, Brave, and Learned Members".</p>
<p>Recently, a man named Fagus wore an oxygen mask and dived from Sète, France into the Mediterranean seabed to a depth of 393 feet below sea level (pressure of 175 pounds per square inch), setting a new record. The old record was 295 feet (pressure of 131 pounds per square inch). However, Fagus eventually died a few hours after surfacing due to physical exhaustion.</p>
<p>After the US Congress passed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the draft of the declaration was taken home by Jefferson, the original drafter, and over time, everyone forgot about it. It was not until forty-seven years later, when they wanted to investigate who drafted this draft, that this historically precious document was found in his home. (Le)</p>
<h3>Talking About Glass Stockings</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Having read the Shanghai local news section of the 12th's "Shen Bao," there's a news item titled "Mayor Appeals to Women: Why Wear Glass Stockings?". The main body of the piece concerns the "Inaugural Meeting of the Shanghai Citizens' Service for Promoting Domestic Goods Association," and the above two sentences are from Mayor Wu's address at the meeting.</p>
<p>In today's strong emphasis on promoting the importance of domestic goods, it is extremely appropriate. And to start by advocating the use of domestic goods in clothing is indeed a practical approach, which we naturally support wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Because we uphold this principle, we demand that it be implemented in a proper and serious manner, in other words, that it be implemented effectively, and not be allowed to be done perfunctorily.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's saying to ladies, "Why wear glass stockings?", of course, the intention is as good as it can be, but how much effect this kind of persuasion can produce is really hard to say. In my view, throughout history, both in China and abroad, the effectiveness of any great statesman making pronouncements on the fashions of ladies has probably always been quite limited. In the past, women were forbidden to perm their hair, but today even my family's maid perms her hair; Beiping also forbade wearing short-sleeved cheongsams, but as spring and summer arrived, the popularity of short-sleeved cheongsams remained unchanged; Mayor Wu is a graduate of Tsinghua University. Sixteen or seventeen years ago, Tsinghua forbade female students from wearing Western trousers. More senior students "dragged corpses" ("Toss" - a way senior students urged new students) and today the number of female students in Tsinghua University wearing Western trousers is definitely not small!</p>
<p>Indeed, from our men's point of view, ladies, "Why" do you have to wear glass stockings? However, on further reflection, there are countless "Why" questions: Why put on cold cream only to wipe it off hurriedly? Why apply powder - and apply different powders in the morning and evening? Why use lipstick - and vary the shade of lipstick according to whether it matches the color of the clothes? Why buy several different styles of handbags every year? Why—ah, why wear glass stockings, and why wear stockings at all?</p>
<p>Is it said to be difficult to change ingrained habits? In my opinion, the ladies' fondness for dressing up has probably evolved from "accumulated habits" to become "natural instincts," as biologists call "acquired characteristics." Therefore, telling them not to wear glass stockings, frankly, is something that will fail in eight or nine cases out of ten. I'm afraid Mayor Wu himself understands this very well. So, what is the way to promote domestic goods—I say: Instead of telling the ladies not to wear glass stockings, it would be better for domestic manufacturers to quickly find ways to imitate and produce them!</p>
<h3>A Record of the Resumption of Jiuda</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In North China, there are three very famous industrial enterprises run by Chinese themselves: Qixin Cement Company (Hebei), Zhangyu Winery (Shandong), and Jiuda Refined Salt Company (Hebei). Jiuda is beneficial to the people's diet, especially in terms of hygiene, and its achievements are most obvious. During the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese invaders devastated and plundered, causing enormous damage. After the restoration, cadres who had returned from the interior, along with local old colleagues, recovered and reorganized the company, sparing no effort in its management. On November 9th of this year, they held the first shareholders' meeting in Tianjin after the war, discussing the resumption of operations and production. Everything is in order, and this is truly a commemorative event.</p>
<p>The people regard food as heaven, and humans cannot eat bland food, so salt is an essential element of food. The Chinese "boiling sea" industry has existed since ancient times, but for thousands of years, people only knew how to eat "raw salt" and could not manufacture it scientifically. As modern trends opened up and new technologies emerged, this salt-making industry, which affected national health and national interests, was not established until the early years of the Republic of China by a few comrades at "Jiuda" who, through long-term efforts, succeeded. Their products include refined salt, reprocessed salt, brick salt, crystalline salt, washing salt, and all kinds of by-products. In addition to food, industrial salt and the chemical industry of salt are essential to the prosperity of various industries, and this deserves attention. Its main factory is located in Tanggu, Tianjin, and its sales extend to various ports along the Yangtze River and major cities. In January of the 26th year of the Republic of China, it was renamed "Jiuda Salt Industry Company," and the scope expanded, and the business flourished. Until July, when the Japanese invaders launched the "July 7th" Incident, North China fell, and the enemy completely seized the company's factories. The scope of Peiping (the residence of the founder, Jing, and the company's office) was also occupied. The cadres first went south, then west, to Sichuan to "start a new stove" (this classic term is indeed appropriate). According to the report of the chairman of this conference, they retreated with the national army and engaged in "boiling well" in Zigong, Sichuan, supporting the salt industry in the southwest, enabling the southwestern people to experience scientific salt, and jointly dedicated themselves to increasing production during the war. Eight years of hardship have created many moving and praiseworthy historical events, and now they have embarked on the road to revival. This kind of miracle is not found in other companies and is truly worthy of boasting!</p>
<p>During the eight years of the Japanese occupation of the Jiuda General Factory in Tianjin, they did not mention a word about the rights of Chinese shareholders but wantonly promoted the excellence of their industrial technology, the abundance of salt production, and the expansion of scale. However, the houses and machinery received by Jiuda after the victory were all damaged and dilapidated. Only half of the chimneys were left in the Tanggu salt factory. The company's office building in the Qing district was occupied by the enemy's military police, and all the sundries on the upper floor were taken away when they surrendered, and even the locks on the doors were removed. It is known that the Japanese only knew how to seize assets, retaining the accumulated habits of pirates, which is ridiculous and hateful.</p>
<p>At the meeting place, the founder, Jing Sou, took the stage. This old man, in his seventies, has experienced the vicissitudes of life, but he is still healthy and strong. He was a successful candidate in the Zhejiang list of the Gui Mao year, and Liang Hongzhi of the pseudo "Reformed Government" and Wang Yitang of the pseudo "North China Political Affairs Commission" were all successful candidates from the same year in the rural examinations (Liang from the Fujian list, Wang from the Jiangnan list). Seeing that Liang and Wang are infamous for ten thousand years, one feels that it is even more rare to be able to preserve one's reputation like Jing Sou. However, Jing Sou is the head of the board of directors, overseeing the overall situation, while the general manager, Fan Xudong, bore the greater responsibility for the actual management and struggle. Thirty years of complex roots, the storms and waves after the "July 7th" Incident, were difficult to deal with, and his talent was truly exceptional. Sadly, he died of overwork in Chongqing shortly after the victory. Thinking of Lu You's will in his poem: "When I die and the Royal Army has pacified the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice!" Mr. Fan was able to see the restoration and die, which is enough to make him proud of Lu You.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Three On Stage and Off Stage (14)</p>
<p>At this moment, Qiyun had already gone on stage, dressed as Su San, kneeling on the stage, and everyone was quietly listening to her sing. Only Fengsheng was still chattering, asking what the play was about, why Su San was a criminal, and why there was a trial. Yun Qing initially told her, but later, seeing that she didn't pay attention, didn't want to say more, and just told her to watch quietly, and she would understand. Fengsheng couldn't understand, looking around, criticizing at will, saying that the rouge on Qiyun's face was too red, that the back of her hands were covered with snow cream, and that her nose was too big, like an elephant's, that the singing was too harsh, and that the play was too boring and didn't make people laugh at all. Little Wang's mother was sitting next to her, and she heard everything she said, smiling with pursed lips from time to time, and occasionally casting a glance or two at Zhuzhai. Zhuzhai was so anxious that he was sweating all over, wishing he could go over and shut Fengsheng's talkative mouth. Looking at Qiyun on the stage, she kept glancing at Fengsheng while singing. This "Yu Tang Chun" was originally Zhuzhai's favorite play, and he wanted to take the opportunity to appreciate its merits so that he could discuss it with Qiyun tomorrow. Now, with Fengsheng's interference, he was disturbed and didn't hear a word of the play on stage. In a daze, this act of "Yu Tang Chun" ended. He hurriedly led Fengsheng and Yunqing out, as if escaping, and squeezed out of the door to return home. At home, this talkative lady continued to criticize, saying that Xueqing was really wasting money to invite them to see such a play today. Zhuzhai was full of anger and had nothing to say to this lady. He figured that Little Wang's mother must have told Qiyun everything Fengsheng said, and he felt uneasy the next day when he didn't go to see Qiyun. At the bank, he felt depressed, as if he had lost something.</p>
<p>He endured until after three o'clock in the afternoon, his mind wandering, and he couldn't help but want to risk going to see Qiyun to apologize in person. But he didn't have the courage. While he was struggling, the telephone on the desk suddenly rang. Zhuzhai picked it up and heard that it was Qiyun calling. His blood immediately boiled, and he answered with a trembling mouth: "I am Xu Zhuzhai!" He heard Qiyun giggle twice and say: "Mr. Xu: Why didn't you come this morning? Are you getting off work soon? I have something to tell you. Wait for you at the Yabei foreign restaurant at five o'clock. Do you have time?" Zhuzhai repeatedly replied: "Yes, yes, I'll be there, I'll be there!" He heard another soft laugh on the other end, a "Goodbye", and the phone hung up. Zhuzhai, after being disappointed, suddenly received a call from Qiyun, inviting him to go. He was flattered and extremely excited. He was almost ecstatic. He had no mood to check the many accounting documents arranged on the desk. He put them all in the drawer and paced back and forth in the room, watching the second hand of the large clock on the wall move, one second at a time. Zhuzhai's heart was getting more and more nervous. Although he was excited, he felt embarrassed when he thought about how to explain to Qiyun when they met, so that she could understand what Fengsheng had said last night. He was afraid that Qiyun, because she had heard Little Wang's mother's report, would make an appointment today to question him, which would be terrible! And she once said on the phone, "I have something to tell you," is it for this matter? It's even more worrying. Within this half hour, Zhuzhai was suddenly happy and suddenly worried. If he went, he was afraid she would question him; if he didn't go, he felt he would miss the opportunity, and he felt a little unsure. (End of this chapter)</p>
<h3>The Heart of a Woman</h3>
<p>— Feng Yunzhuang</p>
<p>The Bible once mentioned that when God created humans, he ran out of materials when creating women, so he had to piece them together, using Adam's rib to make the woman. Later, I don't know if it was through several degrees of evolution or degeneration? It is said that the heart of a woman is the most poisonous. This is not surprising, because the more suppressed they are, the deeper the resentment they accumulate, and once it erupts, it is naturally difficult to control. Moreover, the eyes of society are inherently snobbish. It is considered natural for people to beat dogs, but it is heinous for dogs to bite people. Therefore, stories such as Zhang Xun killing his concubine to encourage his soldiers, and Lord Pingyuan beheading the head of a beauty to apologize to his guests, have been passed down through the ages as beautiful tales. However, if Liu murdered her husband, it was necessary to parade her around the four gates and sing small tunes to humiliate her. After the humiliation, she was subjected to dismemberment before everyone felt satisfied. Even in today's free, equal, and democratic society, the news of Zhan Zhou killing her husband is more sensational than the news of a man murdering his wife because of an affair, because women have always been regarded as inferior animals.</p>
<p>The women's movement began in the second half of the eighteenth century, and some people advocated it, such as Goge and Madame Roland in France, and Ms. Wales Dongkelaft in England. They all advocated that men and women should receive the same education and undergo the same vocational training, so that they can support themselves and not depend on men. However, in this society, it is not easy to support oneself. And even if women can be self-reliant, because of the lack of public kitchens and nurseries, women still have to bear the double responsibility of career and family. Rich men like their wives to be full-time housewives. Poor men, when they are short of money, naturally have to allow their wives to go out to work to reduce their burden. However, before long, when their own income increases, they still hope that their wives can return to the kitchen and settle down. Therefore, working women are greatly affected in marriage, and at the same time, it is not easy to achieve success and comfort in their careers. Therefore, although the advocates of the women's movement speak earnestly, most women in society still listen with indifference.</p>
<p>Moreover, it would be fine if women could always stay at home and be housewives forever, but men's hearts are not very stable, and their status and income are also very unstable, so it is not easy for women to adapt to their requirements. Many talented or beautiful women have wandered around outside, and it is impossible to enter the cage again, because in terms of population ratio, even if there are not necessarily more women than men, it is now too expensive to rent houses and buy furniture. Many men who should get married cannot afford wives. Among the few men who can afford families, it is not easy to accommodate so many women waiting to be married. However, the constitution clearly stipulates monogamy, so many women who are "unmarried" or feel that being single and engaged in a career is too hard have a prostitution mentality, because they can not only obtain sexual satisfaction, but also solve economic problems, so why not do it?</p>
<p>Especially women who live in Shanghai for a long time, when people hear that she has made a boyfriend with a lavish hand, who gave her iron rings, cars, and foreign houses, everyone will cast envious eyes on her. On the contrary, if her boyfriend is poor, and she helps him in business or financially, people will despise her as if she is paying for him. Alas, those engaged in the women's movement should strive to eradicate this kind of prostitution mentality!</p>
<h3>Talking about "Freedom"</h3>
<p>— Shaorong</p>
<p>Freedom will not descend upon a nation; a nation must strive to attain freedom. It is a happiness that must be earned before it can be enjoyed. — Colton</p>
<p>Freedom and unity are inseparable; it is so now, and will be so forever. — Webster</p>
<p>When freedom is lost, life becomes uninteresting and loses its flavor. What is life? It is not walking around, breathing fresh air, or looking at the sun; it is to be free. — Edison</p>
<h3>Between Public and Private</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Humans are not plants or trees, so who can be without feelings? However, "feelings" must be separated into public and private. Public is public, and private is private. Public and private must be clearly distinguished. But if you want to clearly distinguish the boundaries between public and private, you must have a calm mind or be regarded as a "fool." It is said that when Jiang Taigong beheaded Daji, when Daji was tied to the execution ground, Taigong ordered the executioner to behead her. The executioner looked at Daji's face, and "half of his soul flew away," his hand bones weakened and he couldn't remember what to do, and the knife also fell to the ground. Taigong shouted to kill again, but the result was still the same. Taigong knew that this was because Daji's beauty had stopped his "killing heart," so he used cloth to wrap Daji's face and ordered the executioner to kill again. As a result, he was easily separated from his body. I believe that Daji's "beauty" is private feeling, and the "cloth" covering her face is public affairs. People who handle official business must have such a "cloth" to perform their tasks; otherwise, their hand bones will weaken, and the knife will fall to the ground. However, Su Wenxu of the Han Dynasty did not have this cloth and could still keep public and private separate. This is where Su Gong was extraordinary. The Han Shu Su Zhang Zhuan Lue says: "Zhang was the governor of Jizhou. A former friend was the governor of Qinghe and committed many corrupt acts. Zhang went to inspect the area and was about to arrest him, so he invited the governor, set up wine and delicacies, and talked about their lives with great joy. The governor was happy and said: Everyone has one heaven, but I have two heavens. Zhang said: Today, Su Wenru drinks with an old friend, which is private kindness; tomorrow, the governor of Jizhou will investigate the case, which is public law. He directly corrected his crime, and the county officials were cleared." I think: If Su Gong was born today, he would definitely be a famous general in "fighting tigers."</p>

<h3>The Supplementary School of the Social Service Department Decides to Continue Enrolling Students.</h3>
<p>The Service Vocational Supplementary School, organized by the Shanghai Social Service Department to guide young people in further education and employment, has received an extremely enthusiastic response from students since its opening due to its very low fees and the provision of reduced or free tuition for poor students. There are currently more than one hundred students in each department, and there are still many people who continue to request admission. It is heard that the school has decided to continue expanding enrollment once in order to avoid disappointing ambitious young people who are seeking education. Students can register and attend classes immediately. The registration location is at the Shanghai Social Service Department in the Municipal Gymnasium on South Shaanxi Road.</p>
<p>Books Wanted: We are now seeking to acquire a copy of "Implementation of National Defense Education in Elementary Schools" (published by Zhengzhong Book Company in 1938). If you are willing to part with it, please indicate the price and detailed address to Yang Zhenqi, Shuji National School, No. 3 North Henan Road, Shanghai.</p>
