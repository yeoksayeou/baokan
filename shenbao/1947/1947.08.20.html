<h3>魏使再謁主席長談　陳述考察各地印象　兩顧問曾赴漢搜集資料</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕美大使館公布，十九日魏德邁大部時間，均與蔣主席曾談於黃埔路官邸，魏氏自晨十時偕五漢民上尉驅車前往，午間並與蔣主席夫婦共餐，直至下午三時許方辭歸。此外全日無其他拜訪，僅淸晨與近晚與顧問等有所聚談，並趕寫報告。魏氏自華南歸來後，尙係首次與蔣主席晤面。據魏使新聞顧問華生稱，五小時長談當已涉及極廣泛之各種話題，唯具體內容究竟如何，則非所知。記者十九日曾持本報奉贈之魏使初抵京下機時之照片請華生顧問轉交特使。華氏閱後，極為欣奮，謂魏使必將珍惜此友誼之禮物，為此行留一可貴之紀念。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十九日電〕魏德邁特使今晨十時訪謁蔣主席，在密室中長談歷五小時，說明最近訪問台灣，廣州及上海等地所獲印象，態度甚為坦白。按魏氏調查華北與東北後，亦會向主席提出證據，率直批評一部份軍政官員之缺點。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十九日電〕魏德邁特使團工程顧問屈克賽爾，經濟顧問華爾克，偕美使館商務參贊鮑鱗哲等一行三人，於今午十一時自京飛抵漢。渠等午後一時接見此間工礦及交通，金融界代表夏光宇，譯獄泉，孫保茲，朱有騫，鄒安眾，賀衡夫，茅伯笙，徐維榮，王野白等十餘人，聽取渠等意見，尤注意煤礦生產及交通建設近况，因時間匆迫，所有官方招待，均未及參加，僅於午後四時驅車遊畢市區一週，四時四十分即乘原機飛返京。</p>
<p>〔報南京十九日電〕魏使新聞顧問華生語記者，工程顧問屈克　爾，經濟顧問華克爾，十九日晨飛漢攷察該區之經濟情况，晚六時半返京。</p>
<h3>魏使將向美總統　報告我複雜局勢</h3>
<p>〔合眾社南京十九日電〕魏德邁將報告杜魯門總統稱，目前中國情形，比中國對日戰爭結束時尤劣。此項情形，實際上可引用於各方而。魏德邁之報告，將坦白而公正，指出過失究為何方，對於國民政府以及目前與之作內戰之對方，皆加以批評。魏德邁使命，不獨判斷中國之情勢，並且為美國未來對華政策提供建議。自渠抵此間後，則守口如瓶，多聽而不願多談。魏德邁之報告，必以混亂及難以了解之複雜情形為其敍述之背景。渠所發現之事，有下述數項：</p>
<p>（一）中共佔有百分之八十之東北富饒地區以及華北廣大重要地區</p>
<p>（二）通貨膨脹日趨悲劣，顯然無終止曲綫上升之望。</p>
<p>（三）對外貿易，由於政府一再實施新管制條例，仍在不良狀况下</p>
<p>（四）人民開始感覺局勢無望，尙不及渠等以前之敵國日本。</p>
<p>（五）黃河新舊道間之水災，使數百萬人無家可歸，本年冬天有遭逢飢饉之憂。</p>
<p>（六）交通遝輸在可怕情况下。此使政府對遼遼之邊疆，難於保持接觸與控制，並使主要物資移動困難。</p>
<p>（七）政府預算至少有百分之八十作軍費用。此使甚多軍要復興計劃及若干非軍事性質之計劃，不得不延緩。</p>
<p>（八）有大規模之逃避納稅之事實存在。</p>
<p>（九）大國在華商人，感覺中國對於渠等之限制太多，雖則政府正式宣佈歡迎外資，此間大部分美國商人勸告採取小心之觀望等待態度。美國商人宣稱，中國要人有多達五億元之巨款，貯存於美國銀行，由於通貨膨脹威脅，不　提回國內，投資於復興計劃之用。</p>
<p>（十）實際上自蔣主席以下之每一中國人，承認在國民政府內，需要多方改革，但迄今為止，並無多大或就可書。</p>
<p>（十一）前屬於日本之台灣，聞在戰後歸中國後、其行政效率不高</p>
<p>（十二）中國有廣大未受敎育之羣眾，缺乏領導才能及代表資格。</p>
<h3>港美總領痛斥　共方電台造謠</h3>
<p>〔合眾社香港十九日電〕中共電台廣播，美國已與葡萄牙訂立協定，共同使用及改進澳門海港一事。美駐港總領事覆潑十九日駁斥此說為「荒謬絕論」。霍潑同時亦担任澳門領事職，渠宣稱過去十八月中，此項謠諑已數見不詳。渠稱，美國海軍作娛樂性之訪間香港，澳門，已有多時，故美水手及軍官之出現，可能被誤解。霍氏又稱，葡萄牙始終允許美國使用澳門海港，惟除登陸艇之流小型船隻外，其他船艦一概不得入內。霍氏承認曾應美大使館之請，與魏德邁晤談，藉使魏使對華南有更明白印象。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十九日電〕據此間十九晨收聽共黨廣播，斥責魏德邁便幽赴廣州一事稱：「此行乃美國勢力伸至華南之信號，并將引起美英間在該處發生直接之利益衝突。為支配華南，美國將首光逐出英國之勢力。此可由魏德邁八月十五訪問廣州時何故與駐香港美領事會談解釋之」。</p>
<p>該廣播又稱：「美國最近與澳門葡萄牙當局簽訂一協定，准允美國使用澳門海港，由美國撥出三百萬元改進海港設備。眾信此乃美國使香港陷於孤立之步驟之一」。（按澳門當局最近曾否認上項謠言）</p>
<h3>顧維鈞晤羅維特　商談遠東諸問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日電〕我駐美大使顧維鈞，今日會晤美副國務卿羅維特，約達四十分鐘，兩氏對新朝鮮，印尼形勢與對日和會各種問題，曾交換意見。顧氏語記者稱，彼與羅氏之談話，包括聯總在中國之計劃之若干問題。據稱，彼亦曾討論對聯總物炎輸入戰事正在進行之區域問題。中國政府之意見，認為聯總物資運輪安全之保證，須來自雙方。關於租借淸算協定事，彼稱，中美專家刻正研究方案，以便將來談判。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江十九日電〕蘇省選舉事務所十九日正式成立，各縣選所限本月底以前成立。</p>
<h3>主席批覆救進協會　決維護東北主權　武肇煦等將晤魏特使提供資料</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕政府堅決維護東北九省主權之決心，頃又得一確切之證明。此即蔣主席對「九方廿九省市救建協會」之從示。該會為在京北方籍參政員·監察委員等所組成，前因盛傳政府軍將退出東北，曾上書蔣主席，痛陳利害，請求絕不放棄。蔣主席頃已覆示，原文云：「呈悉，查我國八年抗戰，犧性無量數軍民之生命財產，即為收復東北主櫂，豈有輕予放棄之理？無格謠言，不可信也」。又該會負責人武　煦·馬亮·王冠吾·杜光塤·梁先達等，定廿一日晨十一時訪晤魏德邁，提供有關北方之資料及意見。武等十九日下午曾開會研討提供之意見，聞對共匪在北方各省之暴行，將有具體之陳述。</p>
<h3>國際貿易好轉　有待幣值穩定　對日貿易辦法經部將加說明</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕主管國際貿易之政府某高級人員十九日語記者，改訂外滙及進出口管制辦法公布後，我國進出口貿易可望漸有起色，據種：我國過去管理國際貿易機構繁多，權責不明，此番將其合併，而成輸出入管理委會，負責人又為一時之選，對進出口管制當可不若以前之凌亂，戰前我國每年出口額約美金兩億元，去年約一億五千萬元，今年上半年情况較差，新辦法公布後，國內物價如不上漲，則出口可　活躍。當局　出口物資原料產地價格上漲頗注意，渠信上漲程度如不超過三分之一或四分之一，則經營出口者，尙有利可圖，希望上漲勿超過此數。主管方面自新辦法公布後，自當在積極方面協助推進並加張品費，改進商品檢騐等工作，使物資得源源外銷。渠晨後指出，新辦法規定周詳，用意極好，然欲使國際貿易好轉，仍有待幣值之穩定，張院長就任後，對幣值穩定再三注意，實為可喜現象。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕經部發言人談：組織赴日商務代表團實施辦法，業經對日貿易指導委員會初步擬訂，呈請政院核示，俟正式決定後公布。代表人選完全以民勞工商界為主，其中所定公營事業代表五人，並非純粹公營性質，大都為公私合辦事業，在擬議中售予民營者，亦在其列，至對日貿易所擬各種辦法及政府用意所在，在必要時本部可對外作一祥書說明。</p>
<h3>某經濟專家談話　主取消外匯官價</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕消息靈通之某經濟專家，十九日與記者談新外滙政策時，認此舉僅為針對當前金融經濟情勢而採之初步補救步驟，實行以後，雖可收相當效果，然欲使非常經濟趨於正常，仍有待於幣制改革之實行。渠認此舉稱為幣制改革前奏曲亦無不可，此一不願宣布姓名之專家，認新辦法僅為消極性消除障礙，作為積極性鼓勵仍據不够。渠指出、政府所規定之第三季限額，恐不足適應實際需要，如需要超過限額，而限額執行又極嚴格，所需外滙定將超出供給量，在此情形下，唯有求之牌價所能供給以外之外滙，如是極可能發生另一價格，渠對至今尙有官價存在，深引為異，指出除對外財務原因外，迄未見官價有維持必要、蓋公家如需外滙，由財部與國行辦理轉賬手續即可，至糧食煤等五項日用必需品用官價結滙，此舉以前亦曾辦理，惟是否能達到平價目的，眞正襲其利者是否為消貨者，咸有問題，此五項”用品平價，旣為國家政策，且由國庫支出，何不亦用轉賬手續，渠認有官價存在，即為一漏洞，應設法取消。</p>
<h3>平市塲情形穩定　貿易商公會集議</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕外滙市價公布後，北平市場情澎穩定，糧價方面大米平穩，本地麵粉與小委略升，滬粉微落，棉紗開價即下落，四十二支疲七十萬，三十二支降四十萬，廿支紗削價六十萬，棉布亦小落，各種布均降五千元。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕北平貿易商公會，昨下午召開理　事會議，討論外滙開會後之北平貿易問題，僉認　出旣不必按官價結滙，北平輸出即可大量增加，惟大多數仍認為在新外滙及貿易法規中規定確保出口商相當進口數額實有必要。北平主要貿易為出口，如只有大量出口，不能換回相當數量之入口，長時期後，北平經濟即不免枯竭也。此外，彼等並希望中央信託局放棄其過去在華北經營之出口貿易，留為民間各業公司經營。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十九日電〕杭市外銷各貨頓見活躍，平水茶自卅萬漲至五十五萬，桐油自六十六萬談至七十五萬，D級生絲二千九百萬泓至三千二百萬。惟人心觀望、交易淸稀，均靜候市場正常發展。</p>

<h3>京美兵拋入落水案　正兇阿多瑞定罪　俟幫兇賽凡尼審畢一併宣布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕中和橋慘案十九日晨起續審，首對兩被告及美憲兵隊長波　上尉略一詢問，繼即開始辯論，午後舉行秘密投票，以定被告阿多瑞應受之刑罰，下午六時，審判長茂蕭上校宣告，判決結果，俟帮兇賽凡尼改日審畢，呈奉主管長官（按係魯克斯將軍）批准後，一併公布，六時半退庭。</p>
<p>晨九時三刻開庭後，先訊阿多瑞，阿不否認渠與該案有關，但係事後由同事告知，已於驚詫中報告憲兵隊長。繼訊賽几尼，渠之供詞概為不知道。波瑪上尉則報告渠曾就此案訊問阿賽二人。辯論開始後，檢察官甘德首述理由三點，（一）犯罪事實俱在，有證人目睹被告連續將二人推落水中一，且被害人屍首經醫生檢騐確屬溺斃，此等由自由意志作成之行為，實為預謀。（二）無人證明被告並未醉至神志不淸之程度。（三）在神志淸醒中，竟將人推落河中溺斃，顯有殺人意圖。繼由被告辯議人術斯少校及馬基少校辯稱，被告因結婚在即，過度興奮，故稍飲即醉，將人拋下河去，實以歡樂之餘，『拖屍』作戲，不意竟　巨禍，至返營後與機曰場塲憲兵電話所云，亦　後下意識之亂語，均不足證明被告為預謀。檢察官駁稱，此案之罪行極為嚴重，不能以戲謔掩飾，且證人均會證明死者係被告推掀入水，故仍堅持阿多瑞所犯為殺人罪。上午十時辯論終結，下午二時眾法官開秘密會後，並投票決定阿多瑞有罪，至此，中和橋慘案之審訊乃告一段落。</p>
<h3>海軍司令部將再派艦　第二次巡邏西沙羣島　台肥公司派員隨往調查磷礦</h3>

<h3>社論　聯總在華職員的不智！</h3>
<p>聯總中國分署，前以中國政府不保護救濟物資在戰區分配，致使聯總停止以救濟物資遝往共匪控制區，認為有背救濟物資平均分配之原則，乃向聯總提出停運華北之辦法。聯總中央執行委員會不明實際情形，竟訓令中國分署照辦，並提出兩項辦法，要求中國政府接受。聯總以「停運」為手段，要挾中國政府接受其所提出的辦法，自非中國政府所能接受。因此這個問題一直陷於僵局、迄今未能解決。據昨日英文大陸報載合眾社本埠訊稱，聯總中國分署職員，曾聯名電請聯總中央執行委員會，立即停止以救濟物資運華。我們在報端看到了這個消息、眞是啼笑皆非。同時據舊金山十九日上午七時廣播，聯總高級職員對於中國分署職員的要求，一致認為「不智且不當」，足以使這個問題更形複雜，造成更大的惡果。</p>
<p>本報對於聯總物資停運華北，早有所論列，並曾率直指出，中華民族是至大至剛的民族，與其向人搖尾乞憐，以求「嗟來之食」，遺不如咬緊牙關，忍饑耐寒，而謀自力更生之道。所以我們建議政府、要斷然拒絕聯總的建議，如果聯總一意孤行，我們寗顧敎聯總在中國的工作，提早結束。至於我們為什麼要提出這種建議？說來很單純：</p>
<p>第一，聯總對於運來中國的救濟物資，主張不分政府管轄區或是共匪控制區，都應該公平分配。聯總的物資運到共匪區去之後，如能直接分配與老百姓，我們當然也竭誠贊成；但是按之共匪區的實際情形，不要說是自外而運來的救濟物資，就是老百姓自己所有衣食住行的必需品，也不能保留為自己生活而使用。所以聯總將救濟物資運往共匪區，在表面上看來，是救濟那裏的老百姓；但在實際上，無異於接濟共匪，培養他們作亂禍國的實力而已。自政府明令戡亂動員全國人力物力剿共建國之後，當不能再容許聯總假救濟的美名而行接濟共匪之實</p>
<p>第二，最近一二月來，國內災情的報導，紛至杳來，除了黃河的大汛而外，兩廣·四川·蘇北·也在那裏閑水災，災情的慘重，觸目驚心，社魯門總統特使魏德邁將軍也說：『黃河新舊河道間之水災，使數百萬人無家，可歸，本年冬天有逢饑寒交迫之虞。」我們相　聯總中國分署電請聯總中央執行委員會停運物資來華的職員們，，對於中國當前的災情，一定知之甚諗，為什麽一定要置災　於不顧而欲接濟共匪呢？聯總是一個國際救濟機構，又怎能　因噎廢食」呢？</p>
<p>聯總中國分署在華工作，將近兩年，人民直接受其接濟的，固然獲益匪漢，但一般人對於聯總職員的印象，並不甚佳，終覺得他們平時的生活，養珍處優，僅就聯總的，汽車滿街飛一項而論，就足以說明聯總職員待遇的優　了。現在他們旣要求聯總停運物資來華，我們自要請他們早日返國，以免將大批救濟難民的物資，用於無益之處！</p>
<h3>阿根廷將放棄否決權</h3>
<p>泛美會議已於十五日在巴西京城開幕，討論西半球的聯防問題；數日以來，已獲有重大進展，據合眾社的報導，阿根廷外長已有放棄「否決權」之意，這不能不說是美國外交的一大成功。按馬歇爾國務卿曾於是日向泛美洲聯防協定，主張泛美洲二十共和國於反抗侵略時，不得保守中立，置身事外：任何集體行動，如經三分之二之　成，各締約國即應一致執行；但並不要求任何國家供給兵力。當時這個建議就遭遇到極大的阻力，尤其是阿根廷的外長白萊曼基利，堅持着集體行動須經「全體」贊成的原則，使馬歇爾團務卿感覺到相當的苦悶。</p>
<p>從法理上講，美國對於這次泛美會義的期望，乃在根據一九四五年三月成立的查普爾特貝克協定的原則，另訂一個久永性的西半球聯防條約，以維持西半球的和平與安全，與聯合國憲章第八章所規定的區域安全辦法，是完全符合的。自然容易獲得泛美洲各國的贊助，但從另一方面去觀察，美國的計劃，欲求其完全實現，亦有其困難：第一是西半球以外的猜忌，尤其是蘇聯的反對，英國的懷疑，是無法避免的。西半球的聯防，在英蘇看來，無異於美國加强其對於泛美洲各國的控制；自非與　國處於對立地位的蘇聯所能容忍的。第二是西半球內在的障碍，義國不僅主張西半球實行聯防，遇有外來　侵略時，採取一致行動；而且　提議泛美洲各國的軍備標凖化；在若干國家看來，尤其是阿根廷，對於自己的軍備也要依照美國式而標準化，不能不感到本國的國防，更要依賴美國而不能獨立了。同時還有若干國家的人民，對於西半球的聯防計劃　認為一且實行勢必增加人民的負担，在感情上也不免表示　對。</p>
<p>上述的幾種困難，在美國當局看來，最值得重視的。還在西半球內在的障碍，尤其是特別重視阿根廷的倔強態度。所以自從美洲會議開幕之後，馬歇爾國務卿運用外交手段，一直以，阿根廷為其對象，合眾社的報導，如果是事實，則馬歇爾國務卿的外交，可謂已獲得相當的成功了。</p>
<p>預料這次泛美注會議可望圓滿閉幕，西半球的和平與安全，也可　因此而獲得確保：在西半球而首，固然是區域安全制的成立；對於整個世界和平而言，自然也會有相當的貢獻。當此舉世擾亂之際，西牛球聯防條約的締成，尤為我們所珍貴！</p>

<h3>狙擊黃伯惠案重行偵查　鄭德昇被提公訴　涉有教唆殺人未遂罪嫌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鄭德昇被前時報主入黃伯惠控告敎唆殺人案，經高檢處發回重行偵查後，昨經地院檢察官提起訴。茲將起訴書大意摘錄於後：告訴人黃伯惠，爲湖北路一七九號時報大樓業主，住於該大樓之五層樓上，被告鄭德昇居於該大樓三樓三〇三號及三〇七號室，因房屋糾紛，兩人感情漸同冰炭。鄭有美籍友人二人，即在逃之加士韋脫及墨休（爲聯總萬儉輪之大副與二副），鄭曾與兩人談起與黃伯惠房屋糾紛事，協商對付方法。本年二月十八日深夜，黃自外返寓，行至三樓四樓轉角處，突有二西人，一拉其右臂，另一人</p>
<p>發槍擊之</p>
<p>因發彈不準，僅擦過右頭角，受傷未致命，二西人倉卒逸去。該大樓管門吳克昌於十一時回家，見鄭女鄭瀞艷送二西人下樓。黃因素知鄭有西友，且與之有隙，認有敎唆暗殺嫌疑，具狀告訴，業經本處處分不起訴。告訴人不服，聲請再議，發回重行偵查到案，經本檢察官於五月二十三日勘騐出事地點，並令黃伯惠表演當時情形，復奪以五洲美房X光治療室所攝取之</p>
<p>頭骨照片</p>
<p>暨震旦大學法醫學敎授楊士達所鑑定，證明係為槍彈所傷。黃伯惠被害之夕，據被告鄭德昇稱在南京，當時報紙沸揚，鄭氏母女均被羈押，鄭儘可挺身而出，何以至一屋期後，始行投案。又被告稱住於南京劉健羣家中，經囑託詢問，劉稱日期已記不淸楚。查被告稱，二月十八日早車到上海當晚十一時黃被刺，十九日報紙登載，以常理度之，劉健羣即不能記憶準確時日，但　可說，案發前一日確曾住在我家，何以竟以記不淸爲答詞？出事之後，警局派員調查，　　艷·鄭保紋</p>
<p>頗為慌張</p>
<p>關於房屋糾紛事，被告承認曾告知加士韋脫，吳克昌受優於鄭，亦證稱見鄭鄰斃送二外人下來。被害之處，該兇手曾遺留不同之手套兩隻，一鷄皮，一黃皮，均屬軍用手套，查加士韋脫與黃並無寃仇，何以欲置之死地，其爲被告教唆，可以斷定。加士韋脫畏罪潛逃，業已下令通稱，鄭德昇有敎唆殺人未遂罪嫌，依法提起公訴云云。</p>

<h3>冀察聯防　隨軍踏上征程</h3>
<p>〔本報張家口十五日訊〕冀察聯防，終於在　　中實現了，這一支能征慣戰的步騎勁旅，曾經縱橫察綏戰塲，又將馳臨於河北平原。記者很榮幸的參加這次冀中征程，在隨軍出發的人們中。以記者身分出現的，我可以算是僅有的一人。</p>
<p>夜色蒼茫中，火車在平綏路上爬行，目前北方的鐵路，完整而敢於夜間行駛的，這是僅有的一條。戰士們很疲累，呼呼的進入睡鄉。夜，分外恬靜，只有鋼鐵撞整聲，夾雜着幾聲急促的汽笛聲。記者隨指揮所的列車，過康莊已是次日黎明了。站台甚爲冷落，僅有幾個賣茶水的孩子，穿梭於顧客之間，不論碗大小，每碗一律五百元。車繼續行進，出南口別是一番風光，察境的麥苗還不及五寸高，冀北的麥莖已掛上結實的穗子，轉入平保綫上，已是夏麥登塲的光景。</p>
<p>平保綫上　三百里淒涼景象</p>
<p>車過西直門站，休息的時間較長。這裏停的列車很少，旅客無多，比起前門車站，顯得閑靜而有秩序。指揮所於接受保垣綏署的命令後，下午二時，軍車轉人平保綫上，開始戰備行軍。由於沿途情况不明，邊走邊問，車行至爲謹愼。經過宛平縣，遙見蘆溝橋圪立永定河上，同車的人，多係廿六年即參加抗戰的戰友，時隔十年，還得在戰火中奔波，默默中禁不住感慨萬千。</p>
<p>長辛店以南，各站凄凉冷寂，充滿着戰爭景象。良鄉車站，兵士們正在趕修碉堡工事，寶店車站遭共匪焚毀後，僅剩斷垣頽壁而已。每一車站的進出口處，每一座橋樑的兩端，都築有洋樓式的砲樓，並派有一部兵力守護。他們夜間縮在砲樓裏，孤立，守望而不能互援，呼應，碉堡以外的地方，就是共匪活動的領域。　三百餘星的平保錢，在「破壞』與搶修的厄運裏掙扎，有人說，若將一年來搶修的工料積攢起來，儘够另築一條平保路。這一次的破壞，損失尤爲重大，定興以南，幾乎沒有一根完好的枕木和鐵軌。共匪實行有組織有計劃的破壞，將鐵路沿綫的村莊組織起來，分段限時課以破壞責任，否則即以「國特」罪名格殺，所以破壞程度實在可說廣泛而且澈底。</p>
<p>部隊於涿縣下車，往南隨時都會與共　接觸。涿縣還算安謐，當年傅作義將軍守涿州的佳話，仍流行在民間，傳頌不歇。農忙正殷，田野間很少看到　力，曾見一家老少七口人，牽引着一具犁耙播種，水車亦用人挽，一問底細，才知道他們的牲畜已在戰爭中損失凈盡。</p>
<p>流動掃蕩</p>
<p>共匪晋冀察邊區司令員聶榮臻，可算傅作蘇將軍的手下敗將，綏包保衛戰，集衛會戰，收復察省，都曾給聶部一迎串的慘重打擊，從來沒有給他佔過一點便宜。這次冀中掃蕩戰中，共匪更是躱閃避戰，始終保持一百華里的距離。當傳軍收復徐水，共軍盡撤保定之圍，平保路即告打通。起初還以爲共匪要固守河間，等到收復高陽，共匪又回竄平漢路西側，嗣即移師，經蠡縣，博野，安國，望都，而到達定縣，是時共匪已遠遁曲陽，鑽山，始終未與其主力接觸。經過了一個多月的流動掃蕩，軍事算告一段落。</p>
<p>冀中的人民在共匪主力三個縱隊（第二，三，四）的侵擾下喘息，他們希望國軍全力解救，保障永遠的和平與安全，更期待康能的官吏，修明的政治，增進人民的生活福利。（記者竭忠）</p>

<h3>鄱陽樂平交界區　發現三野人</h3>

<p>晨初以隔前央行美滙市價正式揭曉，高於前日謠言，人心略回而開高盤。遞永紗閉後形勢徘徊二三五號二二四號六〇號及散賣紛紜，一〇六號一八六號一八〇號則進，市價在二三〇元左右，大事拉鋸。後經一四號二二四號二二三號一六號號賣出，自二三三元起，盤低至二二五元，八五號九七號二一九號一二九號尙進，仍能回升至二三一元。迨後七樓忽來警局人員拆除對講電話，人心忽怯，二二三號一六三號八二號一〇四號三六號賣出，二三五號雖進，一六號八三號一三〇號亦舊現永紗，跌至二二二元。</p>
<p>十時半，場外息價仍開一角八分二角二分半，一〇四號一〇五號八四號四號二〇七號一五四號一三五號一四號二四號俱進，逐漸回升，永紗盤漲到二二八元，近午銀行界有停止拆放之謠，一六三號二三五號二二三號一一二號斬售，臨收前永紗降低至現遞均為二一九元，而後以二二〇元</p>
<p>收後二二〇號一六三號來進，喊高至二二三元有求，結果較前收，即交股計永紗美亞新光永公勤興中法微升，景福跌半成，新華尙平，榮豐中紡統益中絲商務五和麗安內衣各跌半成，國貨景綸微挫。遞交各股計永紗美亞華　新光景福公司成告徵挫，場外各老股計大生南洋漲起半成，中華浦東五洲跌半成，餘者平疲而已。</p>
<h3>紡綢小組會決定　棉紗維持原議價　仍繼續配紗調劑紗市供需</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會議價小組會各委員，昨日交換意見結果，決定仍維持棉紗原定議價，俾使穩定棉紗市價。同時仍將繼續增配棉紗，以調劑紗市供需云。</p>
<p>紗價回堅</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開以隔日紡建公司及廠家大量開出後，各方銀根略為緊迫，市勢一度疲軟。旋因逢低需求尙佳，布價亦低後回高，人心轉堅，收時價略回上。</p>
<p>結果四二支藍鳳紗比上日軋降十萬元，為一千七百三十萬元。二十支特雙馬則步升十萬，為一千二百萬元。輕雙馬步升十五萬，為一千零七十五萬元。十六支光明步升二十萬，為九百六十萬元。</p>
<p>其他四二支水月，四十支藍鳳，卅二支銀月，二二支金鷄，二十支天女大發，十六支特好做三明海龍等牌粗細紗，一致步升十萬至二三十萬元不一。惟十支童子軍及金寶星，則軋低五萬至十萬元。</p>
<p>棉布平定</p>
<p>昨日棉布，晨開市仍下挫，旋以漢口對元直賃及嗶嘰略有垂靑，而本街染廠對細布亦有吸收，間時更有浮空靈　，指開頭個布頗子不多，終以買賣　他下，行情跌後即回。十二磅龍頭細布由四十四萬元昂至五萬二千元，午收為四十五萬元，四君子嗶嘰由四十六萬回升至四十七萬元，與上日軋平。惟收後浮戶轉賣，聞龍頭細布價低至四十四萬八千元有成交。其餘五福藍竊彩球陽鶴振中等各檔細布，軋挫五千至一萬五千元。白坯漂布組布細斜亦降一二萬元，花布藍布及士林布則互有升沉。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售布三一五〇〇疋，被單七五〇條，申購單共九〇八張。白坏掛牌陽鶴細布為三十六萬四千元，四君子直貢呢為五十二萬元，金蓮妙舞元嗶嘰四十四萬六千元，申購者甚多，並聞加價收購者亦不少。</p>
<p>現棉沉寂</p>
<p>昨日現棉交易沉寂，紗廠納胃甚懈，趨勢呆化，市况疲軟。靈寶做開棧交價二〇三萬，二〇五萬，二〇七萬，周浦籽花三〇萬五千。</p>
<h3>中信局配售人造絲　決維持上週原價　昨市價初開昂升臨收回跌</h3>
<p>人造絲配價問題，前日絲織業代表蔡昕濤等，曾與中信局吳局長任滄一度商談，昨日（十九日）中信局提出會議討諭，據悉：該局對人絲配價，決維持上週原價。</p>
<p>人絲</p>
<p>昨市上午仍告升昂，直至下午，得悉中央信託局已決定於今日配售絲織業人造絲一三期同時配出，約共有一千箱之譜，人心漸呈軟化，始告回跌。上午一二〇號旭字高山有光等喊價二千六百八十萬元，迄中午升至七百二十萬元，最大到過四十萬元。東洋六十萬元，最後價降至六百八十萬元，尙無成交。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市堅穩，成交價與上日相同。DE等級均有做開，前者三千〇五十萬元，後者三千萬元，另担貨亦有十餘担成交，中級貨二千八百五十萬至九百萬元，高另握三千萬至〇五十萬元，開口貨優級干經五祖頭，昨成交價一千八百八十萬元。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市被面慘跌六十萬元，因廠方不斷拋售，以致節節下挫。華强貨開市後一千一百十四五萬元有成交，旋又降跌，最小做一千〇九十八萬元，收市即期做一百萬元，隔日期加四萬元。大誠貨最後價一百十萬元，隔日期喊十五萬元，格子　縐喊價三萬六千五百元，殊乏成交。華錦縐二萬三千五百元，次者二千元，其餘各貨，成交有限，價格尙稱穩定。</p>
<h3>五金略升</h3>
<p>五金貨但他較上日已見上昇洋釘略漲二萬，其他亦有趨上之勢。</p>
<h3>食米重入疲境</h3>
<p>昨日滬甫閘北共到米糧三千七百餘石，店方寶蘿　懈，市　成交閒　，形勢再入疲境，粳秈米　見回跌三五千至萬元不一，白一元亦然挫跌三五千元。新粳仍少軒輕，而以秈米去化最為呆滯。</p>
<p>麵粉堅疲互有，洋粉本粉適成背道，廠粉雜牌粉銷路尙可，挺升一二千元，洋粉　呆，下挫二三千元。統粉暫平之格，麩皮散戶紛紛出籠，供多求少，午時急轉直下，回跌二千餘元·豆餅依然站立，黃豆到銷兩旺，高定次</p>
<p>油市趨勢看疲，生豆油均跌一二萬元，桶生油因轉口停頓，猛跌三四萬元·菜油隨之跟跌一二萬元·蔴油供求兩稀，定中帶軟</p>
<h3>江海關布告　禁食油轉口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關頃布告，略稱：案奉總稅務司電令，層奉財政部長令海關對於食油（包括豆油，花生油，菜籽油，）應暫行停止由上海轉口輸往廈門，　　，汕頭，廣州，及廣州灣等口岸等因，仰尅日施行云。</p>
<h3>白煤市況堅俏</h3>
<p>烟煤廠銷不振，去化甚為情淡，並自經濟部燃料管理委員會，對自由運購煙煤廠商每月暫限一百噸之限額取銷以來，漢口方面辰谿統煤到貨絡續見增，白煤到貨續稀，市況堅俏。</p>
<p>售煤因目前售價與辦本懸殊，市上存　雖多，然各經售商均藉詞報俏，萍鄉焦同行拆價已提同時提高十萬元，焦作篩塊二百五萬元有成交。</p>
<h3>百合干低廉</h3>
<p>百合干以陸續有到，供適於求，故市價日見低廉，現市行盤又降二三萬元，　售六千五六萬元。</p>
<h3>結匯率公佈後　外銷茶喊價上升　所有在滬存貨已可全部出口</h3>
<p>據悉：自外滙新辦法公佈後，外銷茶市况頓現活潑氣象，喊價均見上升。據該業公會唐理事長季珊稱：依照新訂市價雁率，所有在滬存貨，已可全部出口，惟本年度新茶，由於過去經騐所得，產地價格往往隨滙價升漲倍數而遞增，故將來是否能順利出口，尙難逆料。而國外售價亦難保其不跌價，惟茶商方面雖遭受歷次打擊，然其振奮精神，始終堅定不移。本年度產茶，數量確較去年為多，祁門紅茶已製成者，達三萬餘箱，正絡續運滬中。其他如平綠可達八萬箱，屯綠亦在數萬箱，此項茶葉，雖大部獲得中農行貸款，然因其成本高昂，本身摯款仍鉅。如紅茶成本每箱需二百萬，而所得貸款，自三十萬至六十萬元不等，大部仍賴自己資力云。</p>
<p>又訊：各種內銷茶，賣戶雖仍不多，但本街店莊及客帮之去化，廣續乏暢，情况以供求平衡，起伏俱狹，收市結果，多基盤旋之狀。</p>

<h3>醫事人員　甄訓釋疑</h3>
<p>答讀者陸彬林君</p>
<p>准貴科社字第一一九九號函，暨附讀者陸彬林君諮詢關於醫事人員甄訓疑問函一件，茲分別解答如次：（一）仍需參加甄訓，以取得法定資格。（二）甄訓登記，在首都舉行，全國分區，並分三期。第一期爲各省雀會，各院轄市，省轄市及京滬鐵路沿綫各縣，自本年八月至十月。其他兩期，請參閱本會在報紙上所刋載之通告。此項甄訓，係全國性，僅舉行一次，以補救確實具有醫藥專門技術而未具備法定執業資格者，自以參加登記聽候甄訓爲宜。（三）高等檢定考試科別及格者，仍應參加下屆檢定考試，補考未及格科目，全部科目及格後，可取得高等考試醫師考試應考資格，或檢齊證件參加甄訓。准函前由，相應函復，即希查照轉知爲荷！此致申報館社會服務科老選委員會秘書處啓</p>
<h3>代郵　上海市公用局復函</h3>
<p>查　台端函詢本局關於上海煤氣公司增收價格）案，茲逐項核覆如后：</p>
<p>（一）目下實行之煤氣價格本局嚴密審查訂定後，呈奉全國物價委員會核准施行者。現在每度價格三千六百元，係參酌原料用煤及一般物價工價所訂定。本年初，各公用事業公司大多受政府補貼，致從未調整價格；現公用事業貼補已經明令取消，而燃管會方面亦因不受補貼關係，致煤價劇增，因而影響煤氣售價。</p>
<p>（二）關於消耗量限制，據過去紀錄，一般普通用戶四十五度尚足敷用。此項限度，實因公司方面製氣設備生產量已達最高點，無法再予增加，供不應求，不得不採取嚴格限制，以節消耗。</p>
<p>（三）押櫃金乃煤氣公司方面防止用戶欠費之保陣，近經本局核定，以用戶一個月用量之費用爲限。每年得調整兩次，上海煤氣公司爲每年之六月與十二月。</p>
<p>以上三項，特以函覆，即希查照！此致林壽淇君</p>

<p>（一二）過岳陽望洞庭湖</p>
<p>册年夢想洞庭遊，至竟於今願未酬；不免飄然神往也，此時應泛五湖舟。</p>

<p>隻村姑　呌　，黃蕉丹荔　　　；今　喜極　疑夢，　物鄉音忽嶺南。</p>
<p>（二二）車過北江</p>
<p>山程水驛問歸途，地近家鄉意更舒，修竹淸江三百里，雨中沿岸進輕車。</p>
<p>（二三）車抵穗垣，親友到迎者甚衆，賦謝</p>
<p>深慚此日見逢迎，滄海飛波萬刦經；持謝諸公無別語，仍能大節保生平！</p>

<p>翰苑　磻老　仙，高風百粤仰鄉賢；喜經滄海揚塵後，道貌重逢益岸然。（桂南屛先生）</p>

<p>誰從天上落　槍，容我逍遙返故鄉；感到收京功業大，無人能忘郭汾陽！</p>
<p>詩約如今端不負，郊坰枉駕見深情；（三十二年余爲尤靑題「呼江吸海集」末二句云：「平夷指日還鄉去，更赴郊坰野老期」）歸來倘證相期意，一片心光萬里明—（羅尤靑主席見訪嶺南大學寓廣因贈，尤　壽余詩有「一片心光萬里明」之句。）</p>

<p>幾處人家已廢墟，長林今亦盡平蕪；惟餘一棹淸溪水，來訪吾師舊書廬。</p>
<p>（二七）抵穗後各方款待慇懃普遍，桑梓情隆，益令吾看知所勉矣，賦謝一章受盼知非爲組響，白頭遊子極懷慚，衷塲風物山川外，未有涓埃報嶺南！</p>

<p>志同這合老丹靑，一事猶餘憾未平；喜馬拉山峯絕頂，不曾抗手共抄生。</p>

<p>（三五）隔山觀渡</p>
<p>一度山二文寬，龍舟隊　手堪捫；蔽空旗幟轟天鼓，夾岸遊人暍釆看。</p>
<p>（三六）還鄉一月獨坐嶺　校舍成吟</p>
<p>故里歸來才一月，山花野鳥不相　；丹靑可是逃名處，但得潛修願亦讀。</p>
<p>（三七）明羅謁祖</p>
<p>十丈龍舟出海迎，傾鄉大衆致歡誠；拜酬祖德知無似，依舊淸寒一老生。</p>
<p>（三八）將離穗垣淸遊會友餞別即席賦謝</p>
<p>十六年離逾月聚，今朝又萍雲；我持一事堪相慰，至友精神永不分。</p>
<p>如今滄海尚橫流，偶作清　豈浪遊；但使陳隅終砥礪，吾人各自有千秋。</p>
<p>滄桑世事何庸問，此會應能歷久傳；請看近來文讌上，交游都已到兒孫！（諸友每携其子或孫赴會）</p>
<h3>夜深沉</h3>
<p>— 蓮子</p>
<p>夜深沉　，月吻着星的夢！</p>
<p>我靜臥在窗畔的牀上，細數夏夜的星星，一陣陣「的篤，的篤」的竹板聲由遠而近，隨着賣餛飩老人的沉重而滯緩的脚步聲，慣例地又復路過我的窗下。夜似乎給他敲得更深了，但在失眠的我聽來，却倍感親切，彷彿是一個剛自遠方歸來的久別的戀人，在輕叩我的窗門。——當我記起這老人搜弱的背影時，我又情不自禁地倚到穿畔。　夜色溟濛，馬路靜靜地躺在它的懷抱裏，養息這一天的疲勞；在明潔的月色下，路燈發着病黃的光輝，昏然欲睡。守門的狗一也已倦睡在主人的門前了，只有這唯一的夜行者，掮着生活的重擔，像夢遊神一般地蹲躅街頭；我跟望着他的影子消失在樹蔭中，但我又欣喜地看見他在更遠的路燈的光裏重復出現。</p>
<p>人行得更遠了，背影亦已模糊，遙遠地只見一點黑影，在夜色裏掙扎，抖動！「的篤」的竹板聲隨着晚風隱隱地傳入耳鼓，像帶着主人的悲哀來向這唯一的獨醒者訴苦；但是在一個同樣地掙扎在生活的旋渦裏的人聽來，更頻添了一份凄凉。</p>
<h3>母子</h3>
<p>— 杜米埃</p>
<p>杜米埃（Honore　Daumier　1808—1877）是法蘭西新寫實主義的代表者，二十歲左右，就以漫畫著名，一生不得志，直至晚年，受到柯羅（Corot）的物質接濟和精神鼓勵，始獲得從事繪畫生活的機會，故所作油畫不多，而頗受當時名小說家雨果，巴爾扎克等人賞識，曾爲其主辦個展於巴黎，於是聲譽大著。</p>
<p>作品簡潔明快，題材現實，表現善誇張而帶諷刺意味，代表作有「三等車箱」，「法堂」，「求婚」等，此作爲其開始油畫之第一張，乃一　有紀念意義之作品。（劉師）</p>
<h3>「射干」</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>司馬相如子虛賦：『其上則有鵷雛孔　，騰遠射干。』上林賦云：『揭車衡蘭，　木射干。』射干凡兩見，而一獸一草，義殊不同。子虛賦服虔注曰：『射干似狐，能緣木；』而上林賦司馬彪注云：『射干，香草也。』然荀子謂西方有木焉，名曰射干，莖長四寸，生於高山之上，而臨百仭之淵。則又以木名之矣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　381</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>總而言之，要是可能從雲端裏，作個鳥瞰的話，就可看出偌大一片疆域中，還有不少零碎山河地帶，許多民間團體，還在過着舊日山寨生活，紅鬍子也罷，黑鬍子也能，義勇團也罷，游擊隊也罷，無非都是要守護祖國這片零碎山河，不叫敵　侵奪了去。却又缺少了富有新智識的首領指導，同時中央政府，關山阻隔，也離開得太遠了些，交通困難，不易聯絡，所以除了栽種薔牧，採鑛掘獲之外，還兼帶幹些出沒無常，剽刧狙擊的勾當；不問異族同種，只要你對他們不利，戚不順眼，他們就要來稍稱驚動你一下。然而却絕對同情一般純善百姓，不僅不去驚動，只要可能辦到，反而嘯中扶持。這是占代遺傳下來半俠半　的行爲</p>
<p>小老虎回來的這個老　，就是許多　子之一，本來有個名目，只是這個寨子，如今仍舊存在，他們又不需宣傳，所以把這名目暫且不提；只是「老寨」就是。這老寨據　已經　傳了兩三代了，所以能　　一百多戶口，隔三百根「杆子」，數百名男女壯丁，九一八以來，常常抽出一小部分壯丁來，幹着游擊工作。不明內容的人，因其出沒無常，還當牠是另外的集團。</p>
<p>老寨領袖，人家稱他龍五爺，或五爺；不知這個「龍」是他的姓還是名，還是許多同盟派給他的字號；年紀不過四十多歲，也很說得上精明强幹四個字，最大的好處還是「深明大義」；新式說法、就是「正義感，」沒有卑劣行爲，所以能得人心。許多同時代的寨子，好些都土崩瓦解了，惟有這個老寨，始終屹然不動。</p>
<p>這龍五爺的祖父，據說在甲武之戰中，當過武官，是個游擊的前程；一聽走了馬關條約，立即辭官，帶着部下，找到老寨這個地點，立了寨子，安頓下來。傳到龍五爺的生父手裏，幹了不多幾年，看見龍五爺資質都好，早就把寨子的事，交付給他，自己出了家，不問俗事了。那時龍五爺才二十幾歲，武事方面，家學淵源之外，還有祖父手下的幾位老人，文武都有，常常指點一些，方式雖然舊了，倒是些文才武學精華，在這窮山惡水區域內，也將就應用得着，所以二十來年工夫，把這個老寨，統轄得很有規模。</p>
<p>老寨的地勢並不特別，不過東北千萬個山峽之一，而峽背後，都是數十仭高的絕嶺削壁，壁外又有惡林外圍。峽的兩頭，本來有羊腸一般，葠道樵路，通到谷內，然而四季之中，只有秋季草　時候，可以尋跡，其餘季節，冬季大雪，直到春天三四月才肯融化，夏季惡車荆叢，橫生　長，連個路的影兒都看不見。</p>
<p>當初龍五爺祖父，看中了峽內一條長谷，地土不惡，可以闢出數十頃高欒地來，兩壁山坡不陡，又有瀑布泉水；反正國事不堪聞問，壯志已灰，所以把東頭蜿蜒的樵路，開拓了一頭，可以通到大路，就在谷裏築下了寨子，又招集關內一些鄉親窮戶，把這峽谷開墾起來。</p>

<h3>走馬英倫</h3>
<p>— 楊鴻烈譯</p>
<p>—除了孩子，英國人誰都嘗受着饑饉！</p>
<p>編者按：這是一篇似怨似訴，記錄英國貧困現狀的好文章，希望讀者化一點時間讀完他。英國人，有比我們更堅固的民族工業，和一切有利的條件，但是經過長期戰爭後，他們的人民是過着怎樣艱辛飢饉的生活，你看，邱吉爾與英國工黨和他們的人民，是怎樣和他們的環境在搏鬥！</p>
<p>英國人在哀訴，在低泣，但他們却堅靱地咬着牙齒，全民一致地度過這個罕有的難關！</p>
<p>當我到達戰後倫敦後的第一個侵晨，我以電話通知餐室送早點：</p>
<p>「現在我可以呌早點吧？」</p>
<p>「當然可以—先生，你要什麽？」</p>
<p>「兩個煎蛋；——」</p>
<p>「你已經得了兩個雞蛋？先生，我到你那裏來拿？」</p>
<p>「但是我沒有鷄蛋。」</p>
<p>「呵，先生，——我們也沒有！」</p>
<p>當然，我老早已經曉得是英國極端缺乏糧食，衣著，燃料，但在三千哩外觀底不易明瞭眞象，吃過一餐粗黑麵包和一點代用品似的果醬後，我才猛然感到自己置身在一個貧困艱辛的國家。</p>
<p>衣檻人饑黃</p>
<p>在英倫，每一人每星期可買到價値二角錢猪肉，大約有三四兩，或可購到七分錢的罐頭牛肉，每天九兩麵包，一星期三兩牛油，三兩「壘及淋」，可能有時可購得一個鷄蛋。</p>
<p>三十二張配給票，可用作購衣著之用，一雙皮鞋須九張，一雙錢　三張，羊毛背心須用七張，而一套衣服，需用去配給證二十六張！</p>
<p>一個汽車夫曾向我訴苦：「我們現在簡直過著地獄似的生活，我和妻的配給票完全用在孩子們身上去了，自己平日有的一套便裝及一套禮服，便裝已老早破碎不堪，只有一年四季穿著一襲禮服。近據商長克利浦斯爵士宣布，我們現存的配給票還須賴以多維持二個月！」</p>
<p>每日只能用電數小時的一位名女畫家曾告訴我，她淸晨往某美術家畫室工作時，只有藉打火機的微光塗上口紅。</p>
<p>我曾經和一位終日氣憤焦燥的太太談起，其實她是大西洋兩岸極爲熟悉的名作家一，這裏，我只好姑隱其名。</p>
<p>「我在綿長的行列中站了兩點鐘，等購麵包，魚，和蔬菜，回來馬馬虎虎洗淨。無牛乳，鷄蛋，或者牛肉，白白淡淡地燒了吃，如果一個稍能溫飽國家的人跑到英國，不到數月必定要面黃飢瘦而餓殺了。」</p>
<p>人們的焦怒，的確也是出於無可奈何的，雖然現在正是熱天，偶爾一陣急兩狂風，一雨成秋，從人們瘦削的臉上，又似乎看到兩眉緊鎖，他們似乎又在焦慮著嚴冬又快來臨。</p>
<p>庭院裹，綠草如茵，百花齊放，眞是萬紫千紅，一樹細柳長垂，一切仍顯得那樣恬靜，和諧，忽然街上傳來一陣軍號聲，鼓聲咚咚，一隊兵士走來，後面隨着一隊童子軍。</p>
<p>「這些小孩似乎弄得相當強壯，他們好像平日營養很好似的。」我自語着。</p>
<p>汽車夫點首同意：「的確，今日英倫吃得鮑的，就只有孩子們了，一家最好的食物都是他們吃去。」</p>
<p>應一位律師及其畫家的邀請，去看雜劇，我們到戲院七點鐘，因爲是“光節約運動將時間變平，實際還只午後五點鐘，人們大多沒精打釆的坐在等着，台上一位演員幾句趣語，却也引起一陣嘈雜喝釆聲。</p>
<p>「你們忍蔥　個月　這　鐵的地方來，第一幕劇也許在　　喧闊中過去，而第二幕腹內空畫咕路作響，第三慕必將頽然入　！」</p>
<p>邱翁的談話</p>
<p>和英國一些政治領袖們晤見時，我對邱吉爾先生的印象最初幷不太好，當我到他家裏去訪晤，他引我到一間壁畫高懸，畫架林立的美術室，當我從畫架中穿過時，我看到一幅極佳的雪景畫</p>
<p>「這張　」，我說，「該是一些畫中最好的一張了！」</p>
<p>我望着主人臉上似乎浮上一層不可思議的微笑，用他那淸晰有力而又帶有幾分誘惑性似的音調答着；</p>
<p>「這張畫是別人的作品。」</p>
<p>「這裏那些是你的傑作！」</p>
<p>「我的幾張畫已經送到別地方去了。」</p>
<p>（數星期後，作者得悉邱氏的畫，果以溫特之名，在全國展覽會榮獲首選）</p>
<p>邱吉爾，穿着一套不太齊潔的防空服，身强力壯，臉上浮着一層微笑，走上柴特，邁勒寓所的樓上，往沙發上一躺，一小　，敏捷的爬上肩頭，眼不轉睛的朝我望着。那所房子曾為許多英國先賢的住所，亨利第八也曾在那裏住過，邱吉爾現爲政府的賓客留居在此，但幾十年後他那　所恐又將如羅斯福總統的海德公園一樣，爲千萬人瞻仰的紀念地了。</p>
<p>他滔滔不絕的說着，他始　主張英美兩國應該有着密切的　絡，彼此相助無間的合作，（上）</p>

<h3>頑貓阿咪（五）</h3>
<p>— 張樂平作</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>內容貧乏的「青青河邊草」</p>
<p>「靑靑河邊草」是根據西片「魂斷藍橋」的故事改編的。顯而易見的，這改編是失敗的。中西的習俗不同，從「魂斷藍橋中」中襲取過來的故事，在中國土地上無法生根。調中男女主角王子超與　靑，在短短的一段時間裏，由　車，相嚴，而至熱戀，訂婚，這是美國式的「戀愛」所以後來藍青的被騙失身，　落風襲，以至重　子　，及新婚之夜的出走，僅僅是情節的編耕，　作者並沒有從生活的深度上去　掘，這大時代裏的悲　，　得空泛而無力。再載四片「魂斷藍橋」雖是部感　的悲劇，但它多少包合着一個反封建的主題，　「靑靑河邊草」所企圖表現的恰是十分模糊的。</p>
<p>除了劇本報製上的先天不足外，導演方沛霖，是應當　相當失敗　　　。　　一　　　誤差　有故事，導演者除了　着一些當春江的風景來襯托外，那些　　的塲　，是被處理得極爲生硬枯燥的。因　全片缺少了一種哀惋纏綿的情調而味同嚼臘。這自然是導演者的能力問題了。</p>
<p>王丹鳳的藍青，除了具備一個美麗的外型外，對於人物性格的創造，尚需摸索。嚴俊的工程師王子超，那是個十足的洋楊少年，浮　而做作。全劇較佳的是鄭敏的沈經理與子伶的　母。</p>
<p>富春江的外景與山城的景色，攝影與置景上顯得動者的美麗與後者的拙劣。</p>
<p>文藝之片「孽魂鏡」</p>
<p>作爲一部文藝片來看，那末這部從王　爾德的「陶林幫　的畫像」改編的「　　饒」與原著是有着極大距離的。可以說現在　成的「　魂鏡」與王滬　的唯美主義哲學與原畫的主題是有樻檻度的曲解　游離。其實這是好萊塢拍攝文藝片的　病，製片察只　取原著中部份２　怯較淺的故事，而忽略與帮裂了原著，甚　不　　　它的主題。</p>
<p>以還　「　　格留的畫像」被重　或了一部表現追求肉欲　犯罪心理的恐怖片。</p>
<p>但是，如果丟開原著與改編問題，那末我們不能不推崇導演者阿爾伯萊文的優異成績。他對於整個戲的調子把握，全劇氣氛與節奏的控制，許多佈局與暗示的千凈利落，在在都使你感到導演者的才華橫溢。允其那一塲格當刺殺畫家巴錫爾後，動盪的吊燈，襯出了格雷的情緒與當時的氣氛，這是超越的收穫。</p>
<p>演員中，飾陶林格雷的赫特海菲爾，是演得恰到好處，喬治山德的亨利爵士與勞威爾吉爾　的畫家巴錫爾均極穩重稱職</p>
<p>此片攝影價景亦佳。</p>
<p>優秀的卡通片　「失落過的公文」</p>

<h3>Wei Envoy Re-visits Chairman for Extended Talk: Recounting Impressions from Various Localities; Two Advisors Previously Conducted Data Collection in Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The American Embassy announced that Wei Te-Mai spent most of the 19th in talks with Chairman Chiang at his official residence on Huangpu Road. Mr. Wei, accompanied by Captain Wu Han-Min, drove there at 10:00 AM, had lunch with Chairman Chiang and his wife, and did not depart until after 3:00 PM in the afternoon.  No other visits took place that day, only gatherings with advisors in the early morning and late evening, along with rushing to write reports.  This was Mr. Wei's first meeting with Chairman Chiang since his return from Southern China. According to Mr. Watson, the press advisor to Mr. Wei, the five-hour-long talk likely covered a wide range of topics, but the specific content remains unknown. On the 19th, a reporter presented Advisor Watson with a photograph of Envoy Wei upon his arrival in Nanjing, a gift from this newspaper, and requested that it be delivered to the special envoy. Mr. Watson was extremely pleased upon reading this, stating that Envoy Wei would surely cherish this gift of friendship as a valuable memento of this trip.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Special Envoy Wei Te-Mai visited Chairman Chiang at 10:00 AM this morning for a lengthy five-hour discussion in a closed room. He explained the impressions he gained during his recent visits to Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, with a very frank attitude.  Reportedly, after investigating North and Northeast China, Mr. Wei also presented Chairman Chiang with evidence, directly criticizing the shortcomings of some military and government officials.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 19th] Mr. Cooksell, engineering advisor, Mr. Walker, economic advisor, of the Wei Te-Mai Special Envoy Delegation, along with Mr. Bowlin Zhe, Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy, and three others, arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at 11:00 AM today. At 1:00 PM this afternoon, they met with over ten representatives from local industrial, mining, transportation, and financial circles, including Xia Guang-Yu, Yi Yu-Quan, Sun Bao-Zi, Zhu You-Qian, Zou An-Zhong, He Heng-Fu, Mao Bo-Sheng, Xu Wei-Rong, Wang Ye-Bai, to hear their opinions. They paid particular attention to the current status of coal production and transportation construction.  Due to time constraints, they were unable to attend any official receptions, and only took a drive around the city for one hour at 4:00 PM before returning to Nanjing by the original plane at 4:40 PM.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing of the 19th]  Mr. Watson, press advisor to Envoy Wei, told reporters that Mr. Cook Er, the engineering advisor, and Mr. Walker, the economic advisor, flew to Hankou on the morning of the 19th to investigate the economic situation in that area and returned to Nanjing at 6:30 PM in the evening.</p>
<h3>Wei Envoy to Report Complex Situation in China to US President</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Wei Te-Mai will report to President Truman that the current situation in China is even worse than it was at the end of the war with Japan. This situation can, in fact, be attributed to all sides.  Wei Te-Mai's report will be candid and impartial, pointing out where the faults lie, and will criticize both the National Government and the opposing side currently engaged in civil war with it. The Wei Te-Mai mission is not only to assess the situation in China but also to provide recommendations for future US policy toward China.  Since arriving here, he has remained tight-lipped, listening more and talking less. Wei Te-Mai's report will necessarily be set against a background of chaotic and difficult-to-understand circumstances.  Among the things he has found are the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese Communists occupy eighty percent of the wealthy Northeastern region and a vast, important area of North China.</p>
<p>(2) Inflation is becoming increasingly dire, with no end to the upward spiral in sight.</p>
<p>(3) Foreign trade remains in a poor state due to the government's repeated implementation of new regulatory ordinances.</p>
<p>(4) The people are beginning to feel hopeless about the situation, even more so than under their former enemy, Japan.</p>
<p>(5) The floods between the old and new courses of the Yellow River have left millions homeless, with fears of famine this winter.</p>
<p>(6) Transportation is in a terrible state. This makes it difficult for the government to maintain contact and control over the vast border regions and hinders the movement of essential materials.</p>
<p>(7) At least eighty percent of the government budget is spent on military expenses. This has forced the postponement of many important reconstruction projects and some non-military projects.</p>
<p>(8) There is widespread tax evasion.</p>
<p>(9) Foreign businessmen in China feel that China has too many restrictions on them. Although the government has officially announced that it welcomes foreign investment, most American businessmen here advise taking a cautious wait-and-see attitude. American businessmen claim that important Chinese figures have as much as 500 million yuan stored in American banks, and due to the threat of inflation, they are unwilling to bring it back to the country and invest it in reconstruction projects.</p>
<p>(10) Virtually every Chinese person, from Chairman Chiang downwards, acknowledges that extensive reforms are needed within the National Government, but to date, little or nothing commendable has been achieved.</p>
<p>(11) Taiwan, formerly belonging to Japan, is said to have low administrative efficiency after its return to China after the war.</p>
<p>(12) China has a vast uneducated populace, lacking leadership skills and representation.</p>
<h3>US Consul General in Hong Kong Denounces Communist Radio for Spreading Rumors</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong Dispatch of the 19th] Communist radio broadcasts that the United States has concluded an agreement with Portugal to jointly use and improve the port of Macau. The US Consul General in Hong Kong, Mr. Hooper, refuted this claim on the 19th as "utterly absurd."  Mr. Hooper also serves as Consul in Macau.  He stated that this rumor has surfaced countless times in the past eighteen months. He said that the US Navy has been making recreational visits to Hong Kong and Macau for some time, so the presence of US sailors and officers may be misunderstood. Mr. Hooper further stated that Portugal has always allowed the United States to use the port of Macau, but only small vessels such as landing craft are allowed to enter. Mr. Hooper admitted that he had met with Wei Te-Mai at the request of the US Embassy to give Envoy Wei a clearer picture of Southern China.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] According to Communist broadcasts heard here on the morning of the 19th, Wei Te-Mai's visit to Guangzhou was denounced, stating: "This trip is a sign that American influence is extending to Southern China and will cause a direct conflict of interest between the United States and Britain there. To dominate Southern China, the United States will first expel British influence. This can be explained by why Wei Te-Mai met with the US Consul in Hong Kong during his visit to Guangzhou on August 15."</p>
<p>The broadcast also claimed: "The United States recently signed an agreement with the Portuguese authorities in Macau, allowing the United States to use the port of Macau, with the United States allocating three million yuan to improve port facilities. Many believe that this is one of the steps the United States is taking to isolate Hong Kong." (Note: The Macau authorities recently denied the above rumors.)</p>
<h3>Gu Wei-Jun Meets Lovett to Discuss Far Eastern Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch of the 18th] Our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Wei-Jun, met with US Under Secretary of State Lovett today for approximately forty minutes. They exchanged views on the situations in the new Korea and Indonesia, and on various issues concerning the peace treaty with Japan. Mr. Gu told reporters that his conversation with Mr. Lovett included several questions regarding the UNRRA program in China. It is reported that he also discussed the issue of ensuring the safe transport of UNRRA supplies to areas where the war is ongoing. The Chinese government's view is that guarantees for the safe transport of UNRRA supplies must come from both sides. Regarding the Lend-Lease settlement agreement, he said that Chinese and American experts are currently studying proposals for future negotiations.</p>
<h3>Pingjinji Inspection Group Establishes Complaint Box in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] The Pingjinji Military Discipline and Officialdom Inspection Group, organized according to the organizational regulations promulgated by the National Government, will be formally established within this week. The main personnel appointments are as follows: Head: Li Si-Cong; Committee Members: Wu Qi-Wei, Deputy Director of the Xing Yuan; Ma Fa-Wu, Deputy Director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters; Hu Bo-Shan, Central Supervisory Committee Member; Gu Zhong-Xiu, Speaker of the Beiping Temporary Consultative Council; Shi Zi-Zhou, Speaker of the Tianjin Temporary Consultative Council; Liu Yao-Zhang, Speaker of the Hebei Temporary Consultative Council. The group's complaint box has already been set up here and has begun accepting complaint letters. Similar complaint boxes will also be set up in Tianjin and Baoding.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Members' Association Exchanges Views on General Election</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The National Assembly Members' Association held a meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 8:00 PM on the 19th to discuss election issues. Over 150 National Assembly members attended, with Ma Yuan-Fang, Huang You-Chang, and others serving on the presidium. First, the secretariat reported, stating briefly that it is quite difficult to hold a general election during this period of mobilization for the suppression of the rebellion. Branch associations in Hunan, Guangdong, Shantou, and other places have sent telegrams requesting postponement. After several discussions, the secretariat intends to seek the opinions of various representatives to make recommendations to the government. After the report, the representatives spoke one after another, and the secretariat then proposed a motion: "Initiate a collection of opinions from representatives across the country to advise the government to carefully handle the election, convene a temporary National Assembly, and decide on implementation methods and related issues to facilitate the country's construction during the rebellion." The resolution was passed and handed over to the secretariat. Finally, a temporary motion was raised, "Propose to schedule a constitutional seminar inviting members from four institutions: the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, and the Political Participation Council, and ask them to discuss the case," which was also passed and handed over to the secretariat for handling.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] According to information from the Election Headquarters: Election offices have been reported to have been established in Dalian, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hejiang, Yunnan, Guangdong, and seven other provinces and cities. As of the 19th, including the previous ones, there are a total of thirty-one units. Among the total of fifty units, nineteen provinces and cities have either already been established (such as Nanjing and Shanghai) or are in the process of preparing for establishment but have not yet reported.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 19th] The Jiangsu Provincial Election Office was formally established on the 19th. Election offices in various counties are required to be established by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Chairman Approves Assistance Association's Resolution to Uphold Sovereignty over Northeast; Wu Zhao-Xu and Others to Meet with Special Envoy Wei to Provide Information</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The government's determination to resolutely uphold sovereignty over the nine provinces of the Northeast has once again received concrete proof. This is Chairman Chiang's approval of the "Nine Provinces and Twenty-Nine Cities Assistance and Reconstruction Association." The association is composed of councilors and supervisors from the northern provinces in Nanjing. Fearing that the government troops would withdraw from the Northeast, they submitted a letter to Chairman Chiang, emphasizing the pros and cons and requesting that he never give up. Chairman Chiang has now replied, stating, "I have received your submission. Our country's eight-year War of Resistance, which sacrificed countless lives and property of soldiers and civilians, was precisely for the recovery of sovereignty over the Northeast. How could we lightly give it up? Groundless rumors are not to be believed." Furthermore, Wu Zhao-Xu, Ma Liang, Wang Guan-Wu, Du Guang-Xun, Liang Xian-Da, and other responsible members of the association have scheduled to meet with Wei Te-Mai at 11:00 AM on the 21st to provide relevant information and opinions regarding the North. Wu and others held a meeting on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss the opinions to be provided. It is said that there will be specific accounts of the communist bandits' atrocities in various provinces in the North.</p>
<h3>Improved International Trade Awaits Currency Stability; Ministry of Economy to Explain Measures for Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] A senior government official in charge of international trade told reporters on the 19th that after the publication of the revised foreign exchange and import-export control measures, China's import and export trade is expected to gradually improve. According to this source: In the past, China had numerous institutions managing international trade with unclear responsibilities. This time, they will be merged into the Import-Export Management Committee, and the responsible person is also a well-chosen candidate. Import-export control can be expected to be less chaotic than before. Before the war, China's annual exports were approximately US$200 million, last year approximately US$150 million, and the situation in the first half of this year was worse. After the publication of the new measures, if domestic prices do not rise, exports can be activated. The authorities are paying close attention to the rising prices of raw materials at the origin of export goods. They believe that if the increase does not exceed one-third or one-quarter, then those engaged in exports can still make a profit and hope that the increase does not exceed this number. Since the publication of the new measures, the responsible department will actively assist in promotion and improve product inspection, etc., so that materials can be sold abroad in a continuous stream. The source pointed out that the new measures are detailed and well-intentioned. However, for international trade to improve, currency stability is still required. Since Premier Zhang took office, he has repeatedly paid attention to currency stability, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The Ministry of Economy spokesperson stated: The implementation measures for organizing a business delegation to Japan have been preliminarily drafted by the Japan Trade Guidance Committee and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. They will be announced after a formal decision. The selection of representatives will be primarily based on private labor, industrial, and commercial sectors. The five representatives of public enterprises specified therein are not purely public in nature but are mostly public-private joint ventures, including those proposed to be sold to private operation. When necessary, the Ministry can provide a detailed explanation of the various measures proposed for trade with Japan and the government's intentions.</p>
<h3>Economic Expert Discusses Need to Abolish Official Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] A well-informed economic expert told reporters on the 19th that the new foreign exchange policy is only a preliminary remedial step taken in response to the current financial and economic situation. Although it may achieve considerable results after implementation, the implementation of currency system reform is still required to normalize the abnormal economy. This expert, who did not want to be named, believes that this measure can be called a prelude to currency system reform. The expert believes that the new measures only passively eliminate obstacles, while the active incentives are still insufficient. He pointed out that the government's prescribed quota for the third quarter may not be sufficient to meet actual needs. If the need exceeds the quota and the quota execution is extremely strict, the required foreign exchange will definitely exceed the supply. In this case, the only way to obtain foreign exchange beyond what the official rate can provide is to seek it at the market rate. In this case, another rate is very likely to occur. He was deeply surprised that the official rate still exists, pointing out that except for foreign financial reasons, he has not seen any need to maintain the official rate. If the public sector needs foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank can handle the transfer procedures. The use of the official rate for the settlement of foreign exchange for five daily necessities such as food and coal has also been done before. However, whether it can achieve the goal of price parity and whether the real beneficiaries are the consumers are both questionable. Since the low price of these five "necessities" is a national policy and paid for by the national treasury, why not also use transfer procedures? He believes that the existence of an official rate is a loophole and should be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Situation in Beiping Market Stabilizes; Trade Association Convenes Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] After the announcement of the foreign exchange market price, the situation in the Beiping market has stabilized. In terms of grain prices, rice is stable, local flour and wheat have risen slightly, and Shanghai flour has fallen slightly. Cotton yarn prices have fallen immediately. 42-count yarn is 700,000, 32-count yarn has dropped 400,000, and 20-count yarn has been discounted by 600,000. Cotton cloth has also fallen slightly, and all kinds of cloth have fallen by 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] The Beiping Trade Association held a board meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the trade issues in Beiping after the foreign exchange meeting. It was generally believed that since exports do not need to be settled at the official rate, Beiping's exports can be greatly increased. However, most still believe that it is necessary to ensure that exporters have a considerable import quota in the new foreign exchange and trade regulations. Beiping's main trade is export. If there are only a large number of exports but no corresponding number of imports can be exchanged back, after a long period of time, Beiping's economy will inevitably be exhausted. In addition, they also hope that the Central Trust Bureau will abandon its past export trade operations in North China and leave them to private companies.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 19th] Various export goods in Hangzhou have suddenly become active. Ping Shui tea has risen from 300,000 to 550,000, tung oil has risen from 660,000 to 750,000, and D-grade raw silk has risen from 29 million to 32 million. However, people are waiting and watching, and transactions are light. All are waiting for the market to develop normally.</p>
<h3>Engineering Train on the Ping-Bao Section Hits Mine; Employees Shot and Killed by Communist Bandits, Many Wounded</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] The opening of the Ping-Han Line's Ping-Bao section on the 20th has become a problem again. An engineering train heading to Xu Shui at 8:00 AM on the 19th to repair the track hit a mine, derailing three engineering cars. The communist bandits ambushed on both sides then opened fire with machine guns, killing eight employees on the spot and seriously wounding six. In addition, many were slightly injured and captured. According to another report, at 3:00 PM, a regiment of communist bandits was discovered near Songlin Dian, attempting to attack Songlin Dian. Last night, the communications between Beihe Dian and Gucheng were destroyed. The Railway Bureau is very concerned about the unfortunate encounters of several technical personnel and has reported the matter to the Ministry, the Beiping Xing Yuan, and the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, requesting effective protection.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] Two freight cars on the Bei-Ning Line hit mines again this morning, one between Chadian and Jinxihe, and the other between Chadian and Hangu.</p>

<h3>Shen Xi-Zhen and Others Assassinated; Zhonghe Party Members Indignant; Resolution to Send Telegram Condemning Mao Zedong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Shen Xi-Zhen, head of the Zhonghe Party's Haimen branch, and Shi Wen-Han, director of general affairs, were assassinated by communist bandits in Haimen on the 28th of last month.

<h3>Northeast "Sealed Legal Tender" Exchanged for Circulation Certificates One-to-One; Jinzhou Central Bank Ordered to Handle</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch of the 19th] The "sealed legal tender" that was once circulated in the Northeast in 1945 is now allowed to be exchanged for circulation certificates at a one-to-one ratio. The Central Bank of Jinzhou has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to handle the exchange. Teng Mao-Tong, deputy director of the Northeast Xing Yuan Economic Committee, explained this matter, saying that in 1945, when the National Army was expediting its entry through the pass, it advanced rapidly along the Bei-Ning Road. The officers and soldiers of its vanguard troops purchased goods using legal tender at the same rate as the puppet Manchukuo currency at that time. When Commander Du Yu-Ming was stationed in Jinzhou, he learned the truth. In order to avoid losses for merchants, Du's seal was added to the legal tender before it was circulated on the market. At the same time, merchants were allowed to register the legal tender they had used and seal it up for future compensation by the government. The total amount registered was approximately 40 million yuan in legal tender. Later, the Ministry of Finance considered this method to be detrimental to the regulations. After several consultations between the Economic Committee and the Ministry of Finance, it was finally decided to exchange it at a one-to-one ratio. Currently, the county governments and councils of Jinzhou, Jinxi, Suizhong, and Xingcheng counties are each responsible for handing over the sealed legal tender to the Central Bank of Jinzhou for joint inspection and exchange to the registered people.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Staff Stationed in China Request Suspension of Transport; Headquarters Deems it Unwise; Central Committee will Discuss the Resumption of the Transport of Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>[Washington Dispatch from Central News Agency, 18th] UNRRA officials here believe that the request by the agency's staff stationed in China to suspend the transport of relief supplies to the National Government is an "unwise and inappropriate move." According to a Shanghai dispatch, more than half of the UNRRA staff stationed in China have cabled the UNRRA Central Committee requesting that UNRRA ships and vehicles not be used by the National Government. UNRRA staff also requested to be transferred away from "a position that supports one side of the truce."

It would not only fail to solve the problem but would make it even more difficult to solve. The spokesperson said that they had heard that the UNRRA staff in China were preparing to make a request, but had not yet received it. If the request was made by staff of various countries to their national representatives, rather than through the proper procedures of the UNRRA China Office Director, then UNRRA could not recognize it. The UNRRA Central Committee will meet to discuss China's proposal to resume the transport of relief supplies to China.</p>
<h3>CNRRA Henan Branch Formulates Plan to Provide Relief for Autumn Plowing in the Yellow River Flood Area; Allocates Funds to Purchase Wheat Seeds for Distribution to Needy Residents</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from this City] The CNRRA Henan Branch implemented a spring plowing and sowing plan in the flood area this year, spending 250,000 euros to subsidize needy residents in spring plowing, with good results. In order to provide relief for autumn plowing in the flood area, the branch has formulated an autumn planting purchase, transportation, and distribution plan, allocating funds to purchase wheat seeds for distribution to the needy residents in the flood area. The main points of the plan are as follows: (1) In view of the inability of needy residents to clear the fields, all wheat seeds will be distributed free of charge this time to conform to the purpose of relief. (2) The amount of funds for purchasing wheat seeds is estimated to be 10 billion yuan, and a request has been submitted to the headquarters for approval and remittance. (3) The time limit for sowing is set from September 20 to October 10 according to the climate habits of Henan Province. The wheat seeds will be purchased, transported, and distributed at any time within the time limit. (4) The 10 billion yuan for purchasing wheat seeds is planned to be remitted in three installments: 2.5 billion yuan for the first installment, 3.5 billion yuan for the second installment, and 4 billion yuan for the third installment. (5) The wheat seeds will be purchased separately in four locations: Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe. The branch will send personnel to organize a wheat seed purchasing committee with various units to be responsible for handling the matter. The distribution quota is stipulated as: 1.5 billion yuan for Kaifeng, 1.5 billion yuan for Zhengzhou, 3.5 billion yuan for Xuchang, and 3.5 billion yuan for Luohe. (6) Based on a market price of approximately 1,500 yuan per catty of wheat, the entire amount of funds can purchase approximately 7.5 million catties of wheat seeds. Calculating 7.5 catties of wheat seeds per mu of land, a total of 1 million mu of land can be sown. (7) In terms of storage and transportation, it is decided that the warehouses in the purchasing locations and the wheat seed purchasing committees will handle the matter jointly with local transportation agencies. The required transportation tools will prioritize the use of CNRRA trucks, and rubber-wheeled vehicles will be available at any time for transportation.

<h3>US Soldier in Nanjing Bridge Incident Convicted; Accomplice's Trial Awaited for Joint Announcement</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch from this Newspaper, 19th] The Nanjing Bridge Tragedy continued to be heard on the morning of the 19th. After briefly questioning the two defendants and US Military Police Captain Potter, the debate began. In the afternoon, a secret vote was held to determine the punishment to be imposed on the defendant Adore. At 6 p.m., Presiding Judge Colonel Mao Xiao announced that the results of the verdict would be announced jointly after the accomplice Savane was tried on another day and submitted to the responsible officer (General Rooks) for approval. The court adjourned at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>After the court opened at 9:45 a.m., Adore was questioned first. Adore did not deny his involvement in the case, but said that he was informed of it by a colleague afterwards and reported it to the military police captain in surprise. Next, Saveani was questioned. His testimony was generally that he didn't know. Captain Potter reported that he had interrogated Adore and Saveani regarding the case. After the debate began, Prosecutor Gan De first stated three reasons: (1) The facts of the crime are all there. Witnesses saw the defendants continuously pushing the two people into the water, and the victims' bodies were confirmed by doctors to have drowned. This behavior, done of free will, was premeditated. (2) No one proved that the defendants were not so drunk as to be unconscious. (3) In a clear state of mind, pushing people into the river and drowning them clearly shows intent to kill. Next, defense lawyers Major Eustis and Major Markey argued that the defendants were overly excited because they were about to get married, so they got drunk after drinking a little. Throwing people into the river was actually a "dragging corpse" prank in a moment of joy, but unexpectedly resulted in a catastrophe. As for what was said to the machine gun and field military police over the phone after returning to camp, it was also an unconscious rambling after the fact, which is not enough to prove that the defendant premeditated. The prosecutor refuted that the crime in this case was extremely serious and could not be concealed with a prank. Witnesses proved that the deceased were pushed into the water by the defendants, so he still insisted that Adore was guilty of murder. The debate ended at 10 a.m. In the afternoon, after a closed meeting, the judges voted to find Adore guilty. At this point, the trial of the Nanjing Bridge Tragedy came to an end.</p>
<h3>Navy Headquarters to Send Ships Again for Second Patrol of Xisha Islands; Taiwan Fertilizer Company to Send Personnel to Investigate Phosphate Deposits</h3>
<p>[Taipei Dispatch from Central News Agency, 19th] The Navy Headquarters has decided to send warships again from Guangzhou to the Xisha Islands for the second patrol since our country took over the islands. The islands are rich in guano (i.e., phosphate deposits), which is an important raw material for manufacturing chemical fertilizers. Although the island is currently under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, the phosphate rights belong to the Resources Committee. The Taiwan Fertilizer Company, run by the committee, has decided to send two engineers, Lin Hanting and Shen Ke'e, to accompany the ships to investigate and plans to transport the phosphate deposits to Taiwan to manufacture fertilizers. According to Tang Yuanji, the general manager of the company, the company has two factories that produce phosphate ore, one in Kaohsiung with an annual output of 17,000 tons and one in Keelung with an annual output of 15,000 tons. However, it is heard that the harbors on the Xisha Islands are poor and the beaches are too shallow, and it will be necessary to wait until the 400-meter-long pier is repaired before seagoing vessels can dock. It is also heard that the warships sent by the Navy Headquarters will depart within this month.</p>

The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene another assessment committee on the 21st to discuss the matter.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Unwise Actions of UNRRA Staff in China!</h3>
<p>The China Office of UNRRA previously, because the Chinese government did not protect relief supplies distributed in war zones, resulting in UNRRA halting the transport of relief supplies to Communist-controlled areas, considering it a violation of the principle of equal distribution of relief supplies, proposed to UNRRA headquarters a plan to cease transportation to North China. The Central Executive Committee of UNRRA, not understanding the actual situation, actually instructed the China Office to comply and presented two measures, requesting the Chinese government to accept them. UNRRA using "cessation of transport" as a means to coerce the Chinese government into accepting its proposed measures was naturally unacceptable to the Chinese government. Therefore, this issue has been deadlocked and unresolved to this day. According to a Reuters report from this city published in yesterday's English-language *Continental Daily News*, staff members of the UNRRA China Office jointly telegraphed the UNRRA Central Executive Committee, requesting an immediate halt to the transport of relief supplies to China. When we saw this news in the newspapers, we were truly dumbfounded. At the same time, according to a broadcast from San Francisco at 7:00 AM on the 19th, senior UNRRA officials unanimously considered the demands of the China Office staff to be "unwise and inappropriate," sufficient to further complicate the matter and create even greater negative consequences.</p>
<p>This newspaper has previously commented on the suspension of UNRRA supplies to North China and has frankly pointed out that the Chinese nation is a great and strong nation. Rather than wagging our tails and begging for "leftover food," it would be better to grit our teeth, endure hunger and cold, and seek ways to regenerate ourselves. Therefore, we suggest that the government resolutely reject UNRRA's recommendations. If UNRRA insists on its own way, we would rather have UNRRA's work in China end sooner. As for why we make this suggestion, it is very simple:</p>
<p>First, UNRRA insists that relief supplies sent to China should be distributed equally, regardless of whether it is a government-controlled area or a Communist-controlled area. If UNRRA's supplies could be directly distributed to the common people after being transported to the Communist areas, we would, of course, wholeheartedly agree; however, according to the actual situation in the Communist areas, not to mention relief supplies transported from abroad, even the necessities of life for the people themselves, such as food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, cannot be kept for their own use. Therefore, UNRRA transporting relief supplies to the Communist areas, on the surface, seems to be relieving the people there; but in reality, it is tantamount to assisting the Communists and cultivating their strength to create chaos and harm the country. Since the government explicitly ordered the suppression of the rebellion, mobilizing national manpower and resources to suppress the Communists and build the country, it should no longer allow UNRRA to practice the reality of assisting the Communists under the guise of charitable relief.</p>
<p>Second, in the recent one or two months, reports of disasters in the country have been pouring in. In addition to the major flood of the Yellow River, Guangdong, Sichuan, and northern Jiangsu are also experiencing floods. The severity of the disasters is shocking. General Albert Wedemeyer, President Truman's special envoy, also said: "The floods between the old and new courses of the Yellow River have left millions homeless and at risk of starvation and cold this winter." We believe that the UNRRA China Office staff who telegraphed the UNRRA Central Executive Committee to halt the transport of supplies to China must be well aware of the current disasters in China. Why must they disregard the disaster victims and want to assist the Communists? UNRRA is an international relief organization, so how can it "refuse to eat for fear of choking"?</p>
<p>UNRRA's China Office has been working in China for nearly two years. Those who have been directly assisted by the people have certainly benefited significantly, but the general public's impression of UNRRA staff is not very good. They ultimately feel that their daily lives are luxurious. Just the fact that UNRRA's cars fill the streets is enough to illustrate the superior treatment of UNRRA staff. Now that they are requesting UNRRA to halt the transport of supplies to China, we should ask them to return home as soon as possible to avoid using the supplies for relieving refugees in unproductive places!</p>
<h3>Argentina Will Abandon Veto Power</h3>
<p>The Pan-American Conference opened in the Brazilian capital on the 15th to discuss the issue of Western Hemisphere collective defense. In recent days, major progress has been made. According to a Reuters report, the Argentine Foreign Minister is inclined to abandon the "veto power," which cannot be said to be a major success in American diplomacy. According to Secretary of State Marshall, he advocated that the twenty republics of the Americas should not remain neutral or stand aloof when resisting aggression in the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. Any collective action, if approved by a two-thirds majority, should be uniformly implemented by all contracting states, but does not require any country to provide troops. At the time, this proposal encountered great resistance, especially from Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, who insisted on the principle that collective action must be approved by "all" parties, causing Secretary Marshall considerable distress.</p>
<p>Legally speaking, the United States hopes for this Pan-American Conference to establish a long-term Western Hemisphere collective defense treaty based on the principles of the Chapultepec Agreement established in March 1945 to maintain peace and security in the Western Hemisphere, which is fully in line with the regional security measures stipulated in Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. Naturally, it is easy to gain the support of various American countries, but from another perspective, the United States' plan also has its difficulties in achieving complete implementation: First, the suspicion outside the Western Hemisphere, especially the opposition from the Soviet Union and the suspicion from the United Kingdom, is unavoidable. In the eyes of Britain and the Soviet Union, the collective defense of the Western Hemisphere is tantamount to the United States strengthening its control over the various American countries; naturally, it cannot be tolerated by the Soviet Union, which is in opposition to the United States. Second, there are internal obstacles within the Western Hemisphere. Not only does Argentina advocate collective defense in the Western Hemisphere and take unified action in the event of foreign aggression; it also proposes the standardization of military equipment among the various American countries. In the eyes of some countries, especially Argentina, the fact that their own military equipment must also be standardized according to the American model cannot help but feel that their national defense must rely more on the United States and cannot be independent. At the same time, some people in several countries believe that the implementation of the Western Hemisphere collective defense plan will inevitably increase the burden on the people, and they cannot help but express opposition emotionally.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the US authorities, the above-mentioned difficulties are most worthy of attention. It is also the internal obstacles in the Western Hemisphere, especially the stubborn attitude of Argentina. Therefore, since the opening of the American Conference, Secretary of State Marshall has been using diplomatic means, always targeting Argentina. If Reuters' report is true, then Secretary of State Marshall's diplomacy can be said to have achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>It is expected that this Pan-American Conference will come to a satisfactory conclusion, and the peace and security of the Western Hemisphere can also be guaranteed as a result. For the Western Hemisphere, it is naturally the establishment of a regional security system; for the entire world peace, it will naturally make a considerable contribution. At a time when the world is disturbed, the conclusion of the Western Hemisphere Collective Defense Treaty is particularly valuable to us!</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council resumed discussion of the India-Netherlands dispute today.

<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 18th] It was officially revealed here: The United Kingdom has already withdrawn its proposal to mediate the India-Netherlands dispute. The Dutch government has received a telegram from the British Foreign Office stating that the United Kingdom will not take measures to mediate the India-Netherlands dispute unless both India and the Netherlands request British mediation again, in which case the United Kingdom can reconsider the matter. It is reported that the Dutch government is more willing to accept the American mediation proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Dutch Ambassador to the United States Dr. Eelco van Kleffens strongly stated on the evening of the 18th that the Dutch government believes that the Security Council has no right to intervene in the Indonesian dispute. After a 45-minute meeting with US Acting Secretary of State Robert Lovett, van Kleffens said that the Netherlands is still willing to accept the United States' "mediation" in the Dutch-Indonesian dispute.

It is said that Socialist cabinet members advocate proposing more liberal peace conditions, while non-Socialist cabinet members fear that too many concessions will cause other French colonies to imitate the Viet Minh's actions, so they advocate that the conditions proposed to the Vietnamese side should not be overly lenient.

<h3>Party Strife in Japan Surface; Liberal Party Decides to Abandon Four-Party Agreement; Government Parties Publicly Condemn It</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Liberal Party held an executive meeting today and decided to abandon the four-party political agreement, placing the Katayama Cabinet in the position of a purely opposition party. In the afternoon, it convened a meeting of the party's members of parliament, and the executive meeting's resolution was unanimously approved. The main points of the resolution are: The cabinet is already facing practical political difficulties and is hesitant to move forward, using the constraints of the four-party policy agreement as a pretext to embellish the matter. It has violated the four-party agreement on the issue of national coal mine management, and even publicly stated that there is no room for negotiation with the Liberal Party on the decision of national coal mine management. Therefore, the Liberal Party is not bound by the four-party policy agreement, and from now on, will move forward in its own direction.</p>
<p>President Yoshida also issued a statement saying: The Liberal Party will stand in the position of a model opposition party in the future and judge issues from a purely right and wrong perspective. Nishio of the Socialist Party also commented on this, saying: The Liberal Party's statement of being an opposition party is nothing more than a couple who have been separated for a long time now issuing a divorce statement, so there is no change in the political situation. The Socialist Party initially wanted to form a four-party coalition cabinet, but because the positions of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party were extremely opposed, and it was deeply feared that this kind of atmosphere would seep into the cabinet, it resolutely formed a three-party cabinet. Since then, it has not particularly actively valued the existence of the Liberal Party, nor has it severed ties with it. The three governing parties also convened a representative meeting this afternoon and issued a statement saying: Since the establishment of the Katayama Cabinet, the Liberal Party has provided no cooperation, and this time it has automatically betrayed the four-party policy agreement.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] When the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Councillors was discussing the bill to establish a Ministry of Labor, Liberal Party member Mitsuhiro Ono suddenly proposed an amendment, and Socialist Party member Suetsugu Yoshikawa requested a postponement of the vote, so it was decided to postpone the vote to the 20th.</p>

<h3>Acheson's Hopes for Survival Dim; Diplomatic Circles Express Condolences; Rumor Has It That Acheson Carried a Draft of the Peace Treaty with Japan on This Trip</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] After George Atcheson, Chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, went missing after a plane crash, there is still no news of his whereabouts, and hopes of rescue are dwindling. Acheson's friends in diplomatic circles have expressed their concern. Sir Alvary Gascoigne, head of the British Liaison Mission in Japan, said that the disaster occurred at this time and is terrible. General Shang Zhen, head of the Chinese Military Mission in Japan and a 20-year friend of Acheson, believes that Acheson's death was untimely and is a cruel blow and an irreparable loss. Acheson's statesmanship and political wisdom will be mourned by all parties.

<h3>Zhao Zengjue Discusses Public Utilities Issues: Guarantees No Price Increases Within Ten Days; Automatic Adjustment Method Under Review; National Economic Council Dispatches Counselor to Shanghai to Confer with City Government</h3>
<p>Since the foreign exchange adjustment, public utilities and transportation industries have wanted to raise prices under the pretext of increased exchange rates.

Although they can barely maintain this month, they will be unable to continue maintaining from next month.</p>

It is reported that the automatic adjustment method is based on foreign exchange, salaries, and fuel as the principles for calculating adjustments. Whenever the above three items increase by more than 20%, the price will be adjusted. If it decreases by 20%, the price will also be reduced proportionally.</p>

<h3>Disregarding Railway Safety: Colluding to Load Cargo Over the Limit; Railway Bureau Employee Dismissed for Negligence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has recently carried out a major reorganization of internal personnel. It is reported that several employees in the Transportation Department of the bureau and the North Station General Station will be dismissed for violating regulations and negligent behavior. One of them has already been announced, named Diao Pingqing, an employee of the Wei Gen Road Freight Station. Recently, the Yuantong Transportation Company in the city applied to the freight station to transport 15 tons of groceries to Nanjing, which was approved and a freight car was allocated, and employee Diao Pingqing was assigned to supervise the loading and unloading. Later, the bureau suddenly received a confidential report from Yuhuai Company, saying that Yuantong Company had colluded with Diao to load an excessive amount of goods. After receiving the confidential report, the bureau immediately telegraphed the Nanjing Station to inspect, and indeed found that the new goods in the car amounted to 21 tons, exceeding the limit by 6 tons, and the number of pieces also exceeded by 42. According to regulations, the load capacity of each freight car is limited and must not exceed 2%, otherwise the vehicle will be damaged and the entire train will be very dangerous. This time, Yuantong's load exceeded the limit by one-third, and although it has safely arrived in Beijing, it is actually a matter of luck. The bureau attaches great importance to this case. In addition to dismissing Diao, Yuantong Company was also fined ten times the freight fee. The person who confidentially reported this case has been rewarded with a bonus of one million yuan according to regulations, and yesterday a letter was sent to Yuhuai Company to notify them to collect it.</p>

<h3>Re-Investigation of the Attempted Assassination of Huang Bohui: Zheng Desheng Indicted; Suspected of Instigating Attempted Murder</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Zheng Desheng being accused of instigating murder by Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shibao (The Times), has been returned by the High Prosecutor's Office for re-investigation. Yesterday, the prosecutor of the District Court filed a lawsuit. The main points of the indictment are excerpted below: The plaintiff, Huang Bohui, is the owner of the Shibao Building at 179 Hubei Road and lives on the fifth floor of the building. The defendant, Zheng Desheng, lives in rooms 303 and 307 on the third floor of the building. Due to housing disputes, the relationship between the two gradually became cold. Zheng has two American friends, namely Caswell and Mexiu (the chief mate and second mate of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Wan Jian ship), who are at large. Zheng had talked to them about his housing dispute with Huang Bohui and discussed ways to deal with it. Late at night on February 18 of this year, Huang returned home from the outside and walked to the corner of the third and fourth floors. Suddenly, two Westerners, one pulled his right arm, and the other</p>
<p>Fired a shot at him.</p>
<p>Because the bullet was inaccurate, it only grazed the corner of his right head, causing injury but not death. The two Westerners fled in a hurry. Wu Kechang, the gatekeeper of the building, returned home at 11:00 PM and saw Zheng's daughter, Zheng Jingyan, escorting the two Westerners downstairs. Huang knew that Zheng had Western friends and had a grudge against him, so he suspected that he had instigated the assassination and filed a lawsuit, which had been dismissed by this office. The plaintiff refused to accept the decision and applied for reconsideration, which was returned for re-investigation. After arriving at the case, this prosecutor inspected the scene of the incident on May 23 and ordered Huang Bohui to demonstrate the situation at the time, and then seized the</p>
<p>Skull photos</p>
<p>Taken by the Wuzhou American X-ray Therapy Room and identified by Yang Shida, a professor of forensic medicine at Aurora University, proving that it was caused by a gunshot wound. On the evening of Huang Bohui's attack, the defendant Zheng Desheng claimed to be in Nanjing. At that time, the newspapers were full of reports, and Zheng's mother and daughter were detained. Zheng could have stood up, but why did he only surrender after a period of time? Also, the defendant claimed to live in Liu Jianqun's home in Nanjing. After being asked, Liu said that the date was not clear. According to the defendant, Huang was assassinated at 11:00 PM on the same night when he arrived in Shanghai by car on February 18, and the newspaper published it on the 19th. According to common sense, Liu Jianqun could not remember the exact date, but he</p>
<p>Can say, he did live in my house the day before the incident, why did he answer that he could not remember clearly? After the incident, the police sent personnel to investigate, 　　Yan and Zheng Baowen</p>
<p>Were very flustered.</p>
<p>Regarding the housing dispute, the defendant admitted that he had told Caswell about it. Wu Kechang, who was treated better than Zheng, also testified that he saw Zheng's neighbor escorting two foreigners downstairs. At the scene of the crime, the murderer left behind two different gloves, one sheepskin and one yellow leather, both of which were military gloves. Caswell has no grudge against Huang, so why would he want to kill him? It can be determined that he was instigated by the defendant. Caswell fled to avoid punishment and has been ordered to be apprehended. Zheng Desheng is suspected of instigating attempted murder and is being prosecuted according to law.</p>

<p>According to a report by the Republican News Agency, a so-called "UNRRA Staff Association" sent a letter to the agency yesterday, listing 13 points of "facts" about the "shady dealings" of UNRRA in the past two years. Among the more glaring ones are: (1) Only Dong Chengdao and Li Zhuo signed the UNRRA's business payment procedures, and Director Huo never asked about them. (2) What the Director of the UNRRA said about having accounting personnel stationed in the office only refers to the funds allocated by the National Treasury, which is insignificant compared to the entire business expenses of the UNRRA. (3) The newspapers received by the General Affairs Office are cut into small sheets from large sheets for each person, but the number of sheets recorded in the ledger is still the same. (4) More than 2,000 large and small cars were shipped by UNRRA, and the wooden boxes used to load the cars were sold for 200,000 yuan per bag last year, but were not recorded in the accounts. (5) UNRRA has no inventory of assets to date.</p>
<p>Custom-Made Flour Bags Given as Gifts of Western-Style Houses</p>

(7) The Wufu Company was opened by Dong Chengdao, and the first batch of American military food boxes of UNRRA was purchased by the company. (8) Deputy Director Li has exclusive control of UNRRA, employs private individuals, and important supervisors are all from the same background. (9) The Storage and Transportation Bureau was allocated more than 100 wooden barges and iron ships, which were transferred to the United and Fuxin trading houses for management. In fact, these two trading houses are just dummy companies.</p>

<h3>Joint Defense of Hebei and Chahar: Embarking on a Journey with the Army</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Zhangjiakou on the 15th] The Joint Defense of Hebei and Chahar has finally been realized amidst hardship. This battle-hardened force of infantry and cavalry, which once swept across the battlefields of Chahar and Suiyuan, will once again arrive on the plains of Hebei. I am honored to participate in this journey to central Hebei, and as a reporter, I am probably the only one accompanying the army.</p>
<p>In the dim night, the train crept along the Ping-Sui Railway. Currently, this is the only railway in the north that is intact and dares to operate at night. The soldiers were very tired and quickly fell asleep. The night was exceptionally quiet, with only the sound of steel clanging mixed with a few sharp whistles. I accompanied the command post's train and passed Kangzhuang at dawn the next day. The platform was very deserted, with only a few children selling tea, shuttling between customers. Regardless of the size of the bowl, each bowl cost 500 yuan. The train continued to move, and the scenery outside Nankou was different. The wheat seedlings in Chahar were less than five inches tall, while the wheat stalks in northern Hebei were already bearing plump ears. Entering the Ping-Bao Line, it was already time for summer wheat to ripen.</p>
<p>Three Hundred Li of Desolate Scenery on the Ping-Bao Line</p>
<p>The train spent a relatively long time resting at Xizhimen Station. Few trains stop here, and there are not many passengers. Compared to Qianmen Station, it appears quiet and orderly. After the command post received orders from the Bao-Yuan-Sui Pacification Office, the military train switched to the Ping-Bao Line at 2 PM and began combat marching. Due to the unclear situation along the way, they proceeded cautiously, asking questions as they went. Passing through Wanping County, the Lugou Bridge could be seen standing on the Yongding River. Many of the people on the train were comrades who had participated in the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937. After ten years, they still had to travel through the flames of war, and they could not help but feel a thousand emotions in silence.</p>
<p>South of Changxindian, the stations were desolate and lonely, full of signs of war. At Liangxiang Station, soldiers were rushing to build bunkers and fortifications. Baodian Station was destroyed by the communists, leaving only broken walls. At each station's entrance and exit, and at both ends of each bridge, there were Western-style pillboxes, and a force of soldiers was stationed to guard them. They huddled in the pillboxes at night, isolated, watching and unable to support each other. Outside the bunkers was the territory of communist activity. The three hundred-plus li of the Ping-Bao Line struggled in the misfortune of "destruction" and repair. Some said that if the labor and materials used for repairs in the past year were accumulated, they would be enough to build another Ping-Bao road. This time, the destruction was particularly severe. South of Dingxing, there were almost no intact sleepers or rails. The communists carried out organized and planned destruction, organizing the villages along the railway line and assigning them the responsibility of destruction by section and time limit. Otherwise, they would be killed for the crime of "national special agent," so the degree of destruction can be said to be widespread and thorough.</p>
<p>The troops got off the train in Zhuozhou County, and they could come into contact with the communists at any time to the south. Zhuozhou was still peaceful. The story of General Fu Zuoyi's defense of Zhuozhou that year is still popular among the people and is endlessly praised. The busy farming season was in full swing, and few cattle were seen in the fields. I saw a family of seven, old and young, pulling a plow to sow seeds, and the waterwheel was also cranked by people. When I asked, I learned that their livestock had been lost in the war.</p>
<p>Mobile Mopping-Up</p>
<p>Nie Rongzhen, the commander of the communist Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, can be considered General Fu Zuoyi's defeated opponent. The Battle of Suiyuan-Baotou, the Battle of Jining-Weihui, and the recovery of Chahar Province all gave Nie's troops a series of heavy blows and never allowed him to gain any advantage. In this mopping-up campaign in central Hebei, the communists avoided battle even more, maintaining a distance of one hundred li at all times. When the army recovered Xushui, the communist army lifted the siege of Baoding, and the Ping-Bao Road was opened. At first, it was thought that the communists would hold on to Hejian, but after the recovery of Gaoyang, the communist army fled back to the west side of the Ping-Han Road. Then the army moved, passing through Lixian, Boye, Anguo, Wangdu, and arriving at Dingzhou. At that time, the communist army had already fled far away to Quyang, drilling into the mountains, and never came into contact with its main force. After more than a month of mobile mopping-up, the military operation came to an end.</p>
<p>The people of central Hebei were breathing under the harassment of the communist army's three main columns (second, third, and fourth). They hoped that the National Army would fully rescue them, ensure lasting peace and security, and looked forward to capable officials and enlightened politics to improve the people's livelihood.

Fortunately, the armed conflict was stopped, and transportation in Guangwu has now been restored. As for the number of casualties, there are no accurate statistics because neither side wants to report to the authorities. The cause of the incident was a gathering to watch a play.</p>
<h3>Smuggling by Japanese Ships in Southern Fujian: Customs Search Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Fuzhou on the 19th] Smuggling is rampant on the waters of southern Fujian. The Xiamen Customs previously received a tip that two Japanese ships were unloading smuggled goods in the Chongwu waters near Xiamen Port. They dispatched anti-smuggling boats to arrest them, but they had already fled after hearing the news. They are still being searched for. [Another Dispatch] The National Goods Exhibition is about to be held in Beijing. The lacquerware, paper umbrellas, carvings, and wooden clogs here are all special artistic products. It was originally intended to participate in the exhibition, but due to transportation difficulties and high transportation costs, merchants are hesitating and unable to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Three Wild Men Discovered in the Border Area of Poyang and Leping</h3>
<p>Blue Eyes, Brown Hair, Teeth Like Saws, Covered in Scales, Hands Like Baskets</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanchang on the 15th] Three giant wild men were recently discovered near Ciyi Village in the border area of Poyang and Leping, in the "Bobaijian" mountain. They often roam between the paddy fields, devouring the loaches in the fields and the pigs and dogs nearby, causing hardship to the villagers. Those who work in the fields during the day carry sticks to defend themselves. The wild men mostly appear at dusk. When evening approaches, the villagers close their doors and do not dare to go out. Some people secretly peek through the cracks in the doors and see the three wild men marching in formation. The larger two are about seven or eight feet tall, and the smaller one is over five feet tall. They have blue eyes, brown hair, teeth like saws, hands like baskets, and are covered in scales. Their feet are more than a foot long, and they walk very fast. The villagers are all surprised and afraid, daring not to chase them, nor daring to attack them. Every night, they hear extremely loud howls from the wild men. The villagers are spreading the news, but due to superstition, they have not yet devised a countermeasure.</p>
<h3>Sun Liangyu, Director of Qingpu Field Grain Office, Temporarily Placed Under Supervision</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Orders Limited-Time Completion of Registry and Transfer</p>
<p>Former Deputy Director Deng Liangnan of this County Field Grain Office was dismissed from his post due to a case. After Jin Xingtan came to the county to take over, two months have passed. The financial income and expenditure of Deng's tenure has always been handled by Accounting Director Sun Liangyu, and the accounts are unclear and a mess, and have not yet been settled and handed over. Recently, the County Council discovered financial malpractices such as the accounting office privately transferring warehouse construction costs for personal gain and falsely reporting the concentration warehouse Teng Branch public funds of the township offices, and the County Council is issuing a letter to the County to thoroughly investigate. Unexpectedly, the recent Jin Deputy Director found in the office two ledgers (offsetting a tax quota of more than 7,000 shi) with more than 3,000 advance receipts of grain households from the city office paid as field tax; the director claimed the books are managed by the office; the director stated that the ledgers were lost; according to the office, Statistician Li Jingmei had already handed them to the Sun Director's Office, but Li Jingmei said that he had already handed them to Sun. Each side sticks to his own explanation, so Director Jin Xun reported to the County Chief and placed Li Jingmei under supervision first, and he was soon released on bail. Yesterday morning, the Director Sun Liangyu, was suddenly discovered at the Qing-Hu Road Songze Village Station by County Chief Liu in the course of returning to Qing from Shanghai. The Director was walking to the station from Qing and was waiting for a train to Shanghai. County Chief Liu believed that the Director's whereabouts were mysterious and obviously intended to abscond, so he sent police officers to arrest him back to the city, placing him under temporary supervision, ordering him to hand over the receipt ledgers, while supervising the clearing of Deng's accounts, setting a deadline for the creation of a registry and transfer, in order to stress the handover of the case.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Council</h3>
<p>Second Day of the General Assembly</p>
<p>Inquiries Bring a Series of Climaxes</p>
<p>Councilors Think the Military Service Allotment is Unequal</p>
<p>Requests to Review the Shen Kai Embezzlement Case Files</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Suzhou on the 19th] Today was the second day of the Suzhou Council's Second General Assembly. At nine o'clock sharp, the swearing-in ceremony for the newly elected Speaker and Deputy Speaker was held first, followed by the start of the meeting. In the morning, there was a report on the county government's administration, including civil affairs, finance, education, construction, security, society, police affairs, accounting, land administration, field grain, taxation, and military law. Councilors raised inquiries one after another, first pointing out that the collection of grain and rent did not distinguish between rich and poor, causing many malpractices and making it difficult for the villagers to bear the harassment, causing the assembly to invite the Deputy Director of the Field Grain Office, Zhu Shaoqing, to reply, promising to strive to improve it, and the atmosphere at the meeting began to ease. Then there were also inquiries about the issue of rickshaws collecting construction subsidies. The meeting continued in the afternoon, with repeated climaxes. Councilors expressed their incomprehension about the handling of the Shen Kai embezzlement case at the General Tax Collection Office. After the assembly resolved, it was decided to invite County Chief Shen, Chief Guan of the District Prosecutor's Office, and Shen Kai to the meeting on the afternoon of the 20th, bringing with them the case files and ledgers to report. Secondly, councilors from various township districts believed that the current military service quota was unfairly distributed and should be the responsibility of the competent personnel to reply, and requested the County Government to re-determine the number of conscripts in consultation with the Regiment Management District; otherwise, the township district councilors would all withdraw. The assembly decided to invite relevant agencies such as the Regiment Management District to the meeting on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss and confirm. The assembly adjourned at 7:00 PM. The morning of the 20th was for subcommittee review, and the general assembly continued in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Zhang Lingfu's Remains Still Being Searched For</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Liao Kuanghua's Dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th] It has been almost two months since the Battle of Menglianggu. The remains of the late Deputy Division Commander Cai, the late Brigade Commander Lu, and the late Deputy Brigade Commander Ming have been transported to the rear one after another. Only the remains of Division Commander Zhang Lingfu have not yet been found, and looking north at the sky, we feel even more sorrow. For this matter, Division Commander Qiu once inquired about the returning soldiers who witnessed Division Commander Zhang's suicide at the time. According to Division Commander Qiu's statistics, there are three different versions: (1) After the communist army discovered Division Commander Zhang Lingfu's body, they put it in a coffin and transported it to the north bank of the Yi River, where there is a stele with the words "Zhang Lingfu's Corpse" engraved on it. This was witnessed by local people! (2) The late Division Commander Zhang's remains were buried by the communist army thirty li southwest of the Yi River. The inscription on the stele reads, "The grave of Zhang Lingfu, the lieutenant general and division commander of the 74th Division, the lifeline of the Chiang army, who was killed for carrying out reactionary tasks." This stele is made of six-foot-high bluestone. (3) After discovering the late Division Commander Zhang's body, the communist army threw it into the river. According to their judgment based on the circumstances, versions (1) and (2) are quite reliable. Now that the Yi River has been recovered, Division Commander Qiu is making arrangements to send specialists to investigate. In the near future, his remains, I believe, will definitely be transported back. At that time, the loyal and good will be properly settled, which can slightly relieve the feelings of remembrance.</p>

<h3>US Dollar Exchange Rate Maintained Yesterday, Limited Trading by Designated Banks</h3>
<p>Mostly Export Settlements, Fewer Imports</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, representatives from designated banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Citibank, and HSBC, suggested to the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee that the exchange rate from the 18th be maintained. The committee approved this suggestion. The benchmark exchange rate for US dollar settlements yesterday remained 39,000 yuan.

Export settlements were mostly exempt from handling fees.</p>
<p>Trading by designated banks was limited yesterday, mostly involving export settlements. Import settlements were scarce because the settlement rate had just been changed from the official rate to the market rate, and due to issues with obtaining licenses. The Stabilization Fund Committee and the Central Bank had not yet delivered the necessary forms to the designated banks, which were instructed to report their daily trading volume to the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittances Allowed to be Sent to All Parts of the Country Free of Charge</h3>

<p>Hardware goods, however, have seen an increase compared to the previous day. Wire nails have slightly increased by 20,000, and others also have a trend to rise.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Re-enters a Weak State</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 3,700 shi of rice arrived in Zhabei and Hupudong in Shanghai. Shops were tired of hoarding, and the market traded quietly. The situation re-entered a weak state. Japonica and Indica rice saw declines of 30,000 to 10,000 yuan. White rice also declined by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. New Japonica rice was still rare, while Indica rice was the most sluggish.</p>
<p>Flour had mixed trends, with firm and weak conditions coexisting. Foreign flour and domestic flour developed in opposite directions. Factory flour and mixed brand flour sold well, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while foreign flour was sluggish, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Unified flour was temporarily flat. Bran was being sold off by retail investors, with supply exceeding demand. At noon, it fell sharply, declining by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake remained stable. Soybeans had strong arrival and sales, high fixed times.</p>
<p>The oil market's trend looked weak. Both raw soybean oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Canned raw oil fell sharply by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan due to the suspension of transit. Rapeseed oil followed suit, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame oil had low supply and demand, with fixed times being soft.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Notice Banning Edible Oil Transit</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Customs recently issued a notice, stating: In accordance with the order of the Director-General of Customs, and the order of the Minister of Finance to the Customs, the customs shall temporarily stop the transit of edible oil (including soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil) from Shanghai to Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Bay ports. It is ordered to be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Anthracite Market is Firm and Brisk</h3>
<p>The sales of bituminous coal from factories were sluggish, and the turnover was very weak. Since the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs cancelled the limit of 100 tons per month for companies that freely purchase bituminous coal, the arrival of Chenxi Unified Coal from Hankou has been continuously increasing, while the arrival of anthracite coal has been scarce, and the market has been firm and brisk.</p>
<p>Since the current sales price of coal is far from the cost, although there is a large amount of coal in stock on the market, all the dealers are reporting at high prices. Colleagues in the Pingxiang coke industry have also raised the price by 100,000 yuan. Screened coke from Jiaozuo was sold at 2.05 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Lily Bulbs Cheap</h3>
<p>Lily bulbs have been arriving continuously, and the supply is adequate for the demand, so the market price is getting cheaper every day. The current market price has dropped by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and they are being sold for 65 to 66 million yuan.</p>
<h3>After the Announcement of the Exchange Rate, the Quoted Price of Export Tea Rose and All Goods in Stock in Shanghai Can Be Fully Exported</h3>
<p>It is understood that since the announcement of the new foreign exchange measures, the export tea market has suddenly become active, and the quoted prices have all risen. According to Director Tang Jishen of the Tea Industry Association, according to the newly revised market exchange rate, all goods in stock in Shanghai can be fully exported. However, based on past experience, the prices in the producing areas often increase with the multiple increases in the exchange rate, so it is difficult to predict whether they can be successfully exported in the future. It is also difficult to guarantee that the selling prices abroad will not fall. However, although tea merchants have suffered repeated blows, their determination to cheer up has always been unwavering. The output of tea this year is indeed more than last year. The amount of Keemun black tea that has been produced has reached more than 30,000 boxes and is being continuously transported to Shanghai. Other teas, such as Ping green tea, can reach more than 80,000 boxes, and Tun green tea is also in the tens of thousands of boxes. Although most of these teas have obtained loans from the Central Agricultural Bank, their own funds are still huge due to their high cost. For example, the cost of each box of black tea is 2 million, and the loans obtained range from 300,000 to 600,000 yuan, and most of it still relies on its own resources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although there are still not many sellers of various domestic teas, the turnover of shops and guest firms in this street is generally not smooth. The situation is that supply and demand are balanced, and the fluctuations are narrow. As a result of the closing, most of them are hovering.</p>

<h3>Clarification on Qualification Training for Medical Personnel</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Lu Binlin</p>
<p>Letter No. 1199 from your Social Affairs Section, and a letter from reader Lu Binlin attached, inquiring about questions regarding the qualification training for medical personnel. We hereby answer them separately as follows: (1) It is still necessary to participate in the qualification training in order to obtain legal qualifications. (2) Qualification training registration is held in the capital, divided into districts nationwide, and divided into three phases. The first phase is for provincial associations, municipalities directly under the central government, municipalities under provincial jurisdiction, and counties along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, from August to October of this year. For the other two phases, please refer to the announcements published by this association in the newspapers. This qualification training is nationwide and is held only once to remedy those who do have medical and pharmaceutical expertise but do not have the legal practice qualifications. It is advisable to participate in the registration and wait for the qualification training. (3) Those who have passed the subjects of the higher qualification examination should still participate in the next qualification examination, retake the failed subjects, and after passing all the subjects, they can obtain the qualification to take the higher-level physician examination, or gather the documents to participate in the qualification training. The above is hereby replied to for your reference and dissemination. Sincerely, Social Service Section of Shen Bao Newspaper, Secretariat of the Old Election Committee</p>
<h3>Reply from Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Via Post</h3>
<p>Regarding your letter inquiring about the Shanghai Gas Company's increased price case, we hereby reply to each item as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The current gas price is determined after strict examination and approval by this bureau and submitted to the National Price Committee for approval. The current price of 3,600 yuan per unit is determined by referring to the raw material coal and general commodity prices and labor prices. At the beginning of this year, most public utility companies received government subsidies, so the prices were never adjusted. Now that the subsidies for public utilities have been explicitly canceled, and the Fuel Management Committee is also affected by the cancellation of subsidies, the price of coal has increased sharply, thus affecting the price of gas.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the consumption limit, according to past records, 45 units is sufficient for ordinary users. This limit is actually because the company's gas production equipment has reached its maximum production capacity and cannot be increased further. To restrict consumption because demand exceeds supply, it has to take strict restrictions.</p>
<p>(3) The deposit is a guarantee for the gas company to prevent users from owing fees. Recently, this bureau has approved that the deposit amount should be limited to the cost of one month's consumption for the user. It can be adjusted twice a year, in June and December by the Shanghai Gas Company.</p>
<p>The above three items are hereby replied to, and you are expected to refer to them! Sincerely, Lin Shouqi</p>
<h3>Hiring Female Reporter</h3>

<h3>Fifty Poems of Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Chen Shuren</p>
<p>(1) On Setting Sail, An Occasional Verse</p>
<p>Returning home, I feel light as a feather, despite traveling ten thousand miles by boat.</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of my homeland must be laughing at me,</p>
<p>Still a bookish old scholar, true to my original nature.</p>
<p>(2) Passing Jiangyin</p>
<p>A small boat suddenly sails up the Yangtze River again.</p>
<p>The ruined forts and remnants of beacon fires are also indistinct.</p>
<p>Standing alone at the舷頭, stroking my white hair,</p>
<p>How many vicissitudes of life have I seen in my eyes?</p>
<p>(3) Yangtze River Wind and Night</p>
<p>Let the wind and waves outside the cabin beat against the sky,</p>
<p>This old man sleeps peacefully tonight.</p>
<p>Having crossed the turbulent sea before,</p>
<p>How much more easily can I navigate this river.</p>
<p>(4) Feelings on River Travel</p>
<p>I've almost forgotten that the mountains and rivers have been renewed by calamity.</p>
<p>Old inscriptions are found everywhere, recognized from the past.</p>
<p>The scenery remains completely unchanged since my last visit,</p>
<p>I only feel as if I am a person from another world.</p>
<p>(5) Harbor Pilot Chen, of Jiang'an Steamer, Speaks of Seeing Me Twenty Years Ago, Expressing Feelings on Recording the Scenery</p>
<p>So fate is determined even by a fleeting trace,</p>
<p>As I age, the scenery I painted is like fading smoke.</p>
<p>I never imagined that the boatman would still remember me,</p>
<p>Recalling copying life twenty years ago.</p>
<p>(6) Sketching Little Orphan Mountain Quickly from the Boat</p>
<p>I cherish Little Orphan Mountain's independent grace,</p>
<p>Whose support does her graceful image reflected in the water rely on?</p>
<p>How many times have I captured her likeness, right or wrong?</p>
<p>I fear others will laugh at this old man.</p>
<p>(7) Gaze at Mount Lu</p>
<p>It's like welcoming an old friend who has returned alive,</p>
<p>The Five Elders (peaks) look ancient and seem to smile.</p>
<p>Returning with white hair, I still ask myself,</p>
<p>Can I be without shame before Mount Kuang?</p>
<p>(8) Reflections on Current Events</p>
<p>Is there not a patriotic Wang Anshi?</p>
<p>There was also the ungrateful Lü Huiqing.</p>
<p>Except for the simplicity and sincerity of fishermen and woodcutters,</p>
<p>Where in the world can one find human kindness?</p>
<p>(9) Painting Madang</p>
<p>In the past, relying on its strategic importance for blockade,</p>
<p>A thousand iron warships sank in this river.</p>
<p>Today, I paint it from my small boat,</p>
<p>Quietly sitting at the舷頭, painting Madang.</p>
<p>(10) Appreciating Rain from a Carriage</p>
<p>This year again, I rejoice at the promise of a bountiful harvest.</p>
<p>How many thousands of 里 of fields in shallow green?</p>
<p>The early summer scenery in the countryside is extremely beautiful,</p>
<p>In the season of rice planting, the rain drizzles continuously.</p>
<p>(11) Passing the Miluo River</p>
<p>Daring to emulate Zhifang's purity and integrity,</p>
<p>I would rather drink dew and eat flowers.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as the poet's festival approaches,</p>
<p>I can come to this place to mourn Qu Yuan.</p>
<p>(12) Passing Yueyang and Gazing at Dongting Lake</p>
<p>For years, I dreamed of traveling on Dongting Lake,</p>
<p>But in the end, my wish has not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>I cannot help but let my spirit wander,</p>
<p>At this moment, I should be sailing on a boat on the Five Lakes.</p>
<p>(13) Writing to Express Comfort</p>
<p>The scenery and customs of Lingnan are endlessly missed,</p>
<p>How long have I been separated from my hometown?</p>
<p>One thing is truly comforting this time:</p>
<p>Returning home just in time for the lychee season.</p>
<p>(14) Passing Yueyang and Remembering Du Shaoling</p>
<p>It's a pity to pass by Yueyang City,</p>
<p>Without being able to ascend Yueyang Tower.</p>
<p>Who wouldn't feel the same?</p>
<p>Du Zimei, old and ill, on a boat in those years.</p>
<p>(15) Rainy Night at Changsha Station</p>
<p>The pattering night rain records my journey by carriage.</p>
<p>It's hard to sleep in the ancient驿, thoughts wandering endlessly.</p>
<p>I am ashamed that I have no good strategies for maintaining order,</p>
<p>Emptily recalling buying Changsha to save the world.</p>
<p>(16) An Occasional Verse in the Rain Along the Xiang River from a Carriage</p>
<p>The rainy scenery of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers has been my lifelong dream.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I comfortably travel and recline in a light carriage.</p>
<p>If Heaven bestows its kindness again another day,</p>
<p>I hope it won't begrudge me a small boat.</p>
<p>(17) Dengjia Tang</p>
<p>Dengjia Tang marks the boundary of the Xiang River's fishing nets.</p>
<p>Just a few steps away, and I'm in my hometown.</p>
<p>Returning today, my hair is also white,</p>
<p>It's hard to forget the vicissitudes of Zhongzhou!</p>
<p>(18) Gazing at Mount Heng in the Rain</p>
<p>I love to see Mount Heng shrouded in mist and rain.</p>
<p>Daring not hope for clear skies and silently pray for longevity.</p>
<p>The Purple Cover Peak is deeply hidden, and the Heavenly Pillar is obscured,</p>
<p>I can only remotely recognize Mount Zhurong.</p>
<p>(19) Passing Meiling</p>
<p>Plum blossoms bloom on Meiling in October.</p>
<p>How often have I personally seen the flowers in full bloom?</p>
<p>The peaks overlap, 濠 rains incessantly,</p>
<p>But I come when the plums are yellow.</p>
<p>(20) In the Carriage, Appreciating New Poems with Ruowen</p>
<p>Originally different from official duties,</p>
<p>Also different from the startled crows at dawn;</p>
<p>Burdened with talent, now also burdened with official duties,</p>
<p>There truly are earthbound immortals in this world.</p>
<p>(21) Painting at 　　Station</p>
<p>Only the village girl　calls　,</p>
<p>Yellow bananas and red lychees　　　;</p>
<p>Today　, overcome with joy　, I suspect it's a dream,</p>
<p>The local dialect and things of my hometown suddenly feel like Lingnan.</p>
<p>(22) Passing the North River by Carriage</p>
<p>Asking about the way home through mountain paths and water stations,</p>
<p>The closer to home, the more comfortable I feel.</p>
<p>Three hundred 里 of clear river and bamboo,</p>
<p>A light carriage advances along the banks in the rain.</p>
<p>(23) Arriving at Suiyuan by Carriage, Welcomed by Many Friends; Thanking Them in Verse</p>
<p>Deeply ashamed to see such a welcome today,</p>
<p>Flying across the vast sea, passing through myriad calamities.</p>
<p>I offer no other words to thank you all,</p>
<p>Still able to maintain my integrity and survive!</p>
<p>(24) Ten Quatrains to Friends</p>
<p>The old immortal of Hanlin 　磻,</p>
<p>His noble character is admired in the Cantonese region.</p>
<p>After the vicissitudes of life,</p>
<p>Meeting again, his moral character is even more upright. (Mr. Gui Nanping)</p>
<p>It is our generation's responsibility to revive the arts,</p>
<p>And we still cannot shirk this burden today.</p>
<p>You and I, old friends of forty-seven years,</p>
<p>Should encourage each other to cherish our remaining years. (Gao Jianfu)</p>
<p>Warm, gentle, and fond of your excellent writing,</p>
<p>How could I forget our friendship based on morality?</p>
<p>I hope you will continue to study diligently,</p>
<p>So that the Cantonese literary world can soar again. (Chen Shufeng)</p>
<p>I have long admired your heroic name as an iron soldier,</p>
<p>The Central Plains relied on you to sweep away the barbarians.</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of Guangdong will gain even more color,</p>
<p>And Guangzhou will become a city of surrender. (The day after returning home, General Zhang Xianghua presented a victory map and requested an inscription, which I readily composed in two stanzas.)</p>
<p>Who fell from the sky with a　spear,</p>
<p>Allowing me to return leisurely to my hometown?</p>
<p>Feeling your great achievements in recovering the capital,</p>
<p>No one can forget Guo Fenyang!</p>
<p>The poetry appointment has now been fulfilled,</p>
<p>You graciously honored me with a visit to the countryside out of deep affection.</p>
<p>(Thirty-two years ago, I wrote the last two lines for You Qing's "Calling to the River and Sucking the Sea Collection": "The day of peace is at hand when we return home, and then go to the countryside to meet the old farmers.") If I can confirm our agreed intentions upon my return,</p>
<p>A single ray of light shines ten thousand miles away— (Chairman Luo Youqing visited me at Lingnan University in Guangzhou, so I presented this poem. You寿's poem to me contained the line "A single ray of light shines ten thousand miles away.")</p>
<p>Never forgetting the heart to brave difficulties in those years,</p>
<p>Although we share deep cups of wine tonight,</p>
<p>I cannot help but hold back tears of joy,</p>
<p>As I recite the "Song of the Night Rain on Ba Mountain." (Presented to Li 　　 at a banquet. When traveling in Chongqing, I sent Ze　 the "Song of the Night Rain on Ba Mountain.")</p>
<p>Your elegies are still being published at home and abroad,</p>
<p>Your integrity was admired at that time,</p>
<p>Meeting again today, we both laugh,</p>
<p>A true friendship that can be sworn for three lifetimes. (Chen Luosheng) (Five years ago, it was rumored that Chen Luosheng had died in Hong Kong, and I wrote a poem to mourn him). Who is like you in seeking little fame and profit?</p>
<p>Press forward diligently and don't let others surpass you.</p>
<p>Our friendship has lasted for forty years,</p>
<p>And our hearts are close to each other every day. (Li Gemin).</p>
<p>You widely depict the different customs of the north,</p>
<p>And meticulously select the unique mountains and rivers of the southeast.</p>
<p>I only feel that the younger generation is truly to be feared,</p>
<p>I'll take off my tiger skin and wait to see who will wear it? (Guan Shanyue)</p>
<p>(25) Visiting the Ancestral Graves</p>
<p>Where can I recognize the graves among the ashes of calamity?</p>
<p>A lifetime of sorrow for not repaying the hardship of my parents.</p>
<p>It's unbearable to return to visit the graves as a white-haired orphan</p>
<p>after twenty years of exile!</p>
<p>(26) Boating from Xiaogang to Geshan</p>
<p>Several houses have been abandoned,</p>
<p>And the tall forests are now all barren.</p>
<p>Only a clear stream of water remains,</p>
<p>As I come to visit my teacher's old study.</p>
<p>(27) After Arriving in Guangzhou, I Received Widespread Hospitality and Cordial Treatment. The Deep Affection of My Hometownspeople Has Made Me Realize What I Should Strive For. Thanking Them in Verse: I Know My Hope Is Not to Create a Stir. A Gray-Haired Traveler Feels Extremely Ashamed. Apart from the Scenery and Customs of My Hometown, I Have Not Done the Slightest Bit to Repay Lingnan!</p>
<p>(28) Staying Overnight at Someone Yu's Old Residence</p>
<p>Who has swept away the old traces of the deserted nest?</p>
<p>Coming to stay for three nights, I have to offer excuses.</p>
<p>Silver candles and brocade beds and tables,</p>
<p>How can they compare to a few thatched huts in a mountain cave? (During the Anti-Japanese War, I lived in the mountains of Chongqing and Xiang for eight years)</p>
<p>(29) The Guangzhou Revolutionary Comrades and Twenty-Seven Overseas Chinese Organizations Jointly Welcomed Me with a Banner; Composing a Poem on the Spot</p>
<p>Gray heads and aged voices gather in one hall,</p>
<p>The speeches are impassioned and fly with passion.</p>
<p>"Model of Civic Virtues" (written on the banner), how can I dare accept it?</p>
<p>I am so ashamed that sweat bursts out like a spring.</p>
<p>(30) Inscribing Jianfu's Painting of the Scenery of the Himalayas</p>
<p>Like-minded old painters,</p>
<p>One thing remains that is still a regret:</p>
<p>At the absolute peak of the Himalayas,</p>
<p>I never had the chance to sketch alongside you.</p>
<p>Mount Emei and the Rocky Mountains,</p>
<p>I have also climbed to their towering heights.</p>
<p>How could I willingly lose to you in the end,</p>
<p>Not pursuing strange victories and grasping the entire world?</p>
<p>(31) Listening to Cicadas</p>
<p>I firmly believe that human happiness requires a pure heart,</p>
<p>As I age, I feel leisurely and my intentions are completely peaceful.</p>
<p>Everyone says that it's good to spend the summer in my hometown,</p>
<p>And even more so to hear the clear cicada sounds in the study.</p>
<p>(32) The Night Before the Dragon Boat Festival, Unable to Sleep in the Dormitory of Lingnan School, I Compose a Poem</p>
<p>Counting the remaining village clappers in the small doctor's building,</p>
<p>The crickets are singing mournfully, but it's not autumn.</p>
<p>I don't feel that the scenery and customs of my hometown are different,</p>
<p>But I'm happy to watch the dragon boats tomorrow.</p>
<p>(33) Dragon Boat Festival in Guangzhou</p>
<p>Ten-丈 long dragon boats race,</p>
<p>Embroidered flags and agricultural drums fill the river with noise.</p>
<p>Crimson sun, white rain, and red pomegranate fire,</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>(34) Slogan During the Welcome Meeting of All the People of Geshan Township</p>
<p>Eighty-eight years ago, I once studied with great ambition,</p>
<p>And people couldn't help but laugh at my mighty presence.</p>
<p>The elders and children of the entire township welcome me together,</p>
<p>The flags and banners, swords and spears have the momentum of a dragon.</p>
<p>(35) Watching the Dragon Boats from Geshan</p>
<p>Once across the mountain, twice across the stream,</p>
<p>The oars of the dragon boat team can almost be touched by hand.</p>
<p>Flags block out the sky, and drums thunder,</p>
<p>The tourists on both banks are thirsty for a glimpse.</p>
<p>(36) One Month After Returning Home, Sitting Alone in the Lingnan School Dormitory, I Compose a Poem</p>
<p>It's only been a month since I returned to my hometown,</p>
<p>And the mountain flowers and wild birds don't　　each other.</p>
<p>Is painting a place to escape fame?</p>
<p>But obtaining a place for quiet study is also what I wish for.</p>
<p>(37) Paying Respects to the Ancestral Graves</p>
<p>Ten-丈long dragon boats came out to sea to welcome me,</p>
<p>The entire township expressed joy and sincerity.</p>
<p>I know that there is no way to repay the virtues of my ancestors,</p>
<p>So I remain a simple and poor old scholar.</p>
<p>(38) As I Am About to Leave Suiyuan, I Am Bidden Farewell with a Pure Tour and Gathering of Friends; Composing a Poem of Thanks on the Spot</p>
<p>Separated for sixteen years, gathered for over a month,</p>
<p>Today we are drifting clouds again.</p>
<p>I hold one thing that can comfort you:</p>
<p>That our eternal friendship will never be broken.</p>
<p>Now the vast sea is still turbulent,</p>
<p>Occasionally making a clear 　, how can it be a frivolous journey?</p>
<p>But if Chen隅can be grinded into a whetstone,</p>
<p>We each have our own future.</p>
<p>Why ask about the vicissitudes of life?</p>
<p>This meeting should be able to last for a long time.</p>
<p>Please look at the recent literary banquets,</p>
<p>Where our friends have brought their sons and grandsons! (Every friend brings their sons or grandsons to the meeting)</p>
<h3>Deep Night</h3>
<p>— Lotus Seed</p>
<p>Deep night, the moon kisses the dreams of the stars!</p>
<p>I lie quietly on the bed by the window, counting the stars of a summer night. A series of "di du, di du" sounds of bamboo clappers come from afar, and with the heavy and sluggish footsteps of the old wonton seller, routinely pass under my window again. The night seems to be made deeper by his knocking, but to me, suffering from insomnia, it feels especially intimate, as if a long-separated lover has just returned from afar and is gently knocking on my window. — When I remember the old man's frail figure, I can't help but lean on the window again. The night is misty, and the road lies quietly in its embrace, resting from the fatigue of the day; under the bright moonlight, the streetlights emit a sickly yellow glow, drowsy and wanting to sleep. The guard dog is also tired and sleeping in front of its owner's door, only this sole night traveler, shouldering the burden of life, roams the streets like a sleepwalker; I follow his shadow as it disappears into the shade of the trees, but I am also happy to see him reappear in the light of a more distant streetlamp.</p>
<p>The person walks further, and the figure becomes blurred, a distant black shadow struggling and shaking in the night! The "di du" sound of the bamboo clappers faintly enters my ears with the evening breeze, as if carrying the owner's sorrow to complain to the only one who is awake; but to someone who is also struggling in the vortex of life, it adds a touch of sadness.</p>
<h3>Mother and Child</h3>
<p>— Daumier</p>
<p>Honoré Daumier (1808-1877) was a representative of French Realism. He became famous for his cartoons around the age of twenty. He was unsuccessful throughout his life until his later years when he received material assistance and spiritual encouragement from Corot, which gave him the opportunity to pursue a life of painting. Therefore, he did not create many oil paintings, but they were highly appreciated by famous novelists such as Victor Hugo and Balzac, who organized a solo exhibition for him in Paris, and his reputation grew greatly.</p>
<p>His works are simple and lively, with realistic themes, expressing exaggeration with a satirical meaning. His representative works include "Third-Class Carriage," "The Courtroom," and "The Proposal." This work is his first oil painting and is a work of commemorative significance. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>"Belamcanda chinensis"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Sima Xiangru's "Rhapsody on Sir Fantasy": "Above them are phoenixes and peacocks, soaring belamcanda." "Rhapsody on the Imperial Park": "Uncover the Henglan, Xiangmu belamcanda." Belamcanda appears twice, once as an animal and once as a grass, with very different meanings. In "Rhapsody on Sir Fantasy," Fu Qian's annotation says: "Belamcanda resembles a fox and can climb trees;" while in "Rhapsody on the Imperial Park," Sima Biao's annotation says: "Belamcanda is a fragrant grass." However, Xunzi said that there is a tree in the West called Belamcanda, with a stem four inches long, growing on high mountains and overlooking a hundred-ren abyss. So it is also named after a tree.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 381</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>In short, if it were possible to have a bird's-eye view from the clouds, one would see that in such a large territory, there are still many fragmented mountains and rivers, and many folk groups are still living the old mountain village life. Whether they are Red Beards or Black Beards, Volunteer Corps or guerrillas, they all want to protect this fragmented mountain and river of the motherland, and not let the enemy invade and seize it. However, they lack the guidance of leaders with new knowledge, and at the same time, the central government is separated by mountains and rivers, and too far away. Transportation is difficult, and it is not easy to contact them. Therefore, in addition to planting roses and pasturing, mining and obtaining, they also do some elusive, plundering and sniping activities; regardless of whether you are a different race or the same kind, as long as you are unfavorable to them, or they don't like the look of you, they will come and disturb you a little. However, they absolutely sympathize with ordinary, kind people, and not only do not disturb them, but also provide support if possible. This is a semi-chivalrous and semi-bandit behavior inherited from ancient times.</p>
<p>The old village that Little Tiger returned to is one of many villages. It originally had a name, but because this village still exists today and they do not need publicity, the name will not be mentioned for the time being; it is simply "Old Village." It is said that this Old Village has been passed down for two or three generations, so it has over a hundred households, separated by three hundred "poles," hundreds of male and female strong laborers. Since the September 18th Incident, a small portion of the strong laborers have often been drawn out to do guerrilla work. People who do not understand the situation, because of their elusive nature, still consider them to be a separate group.</p>
<p>The leader of the Old Village is called Lord Long Five, or Fifth Lord; it is not known whether this "Long" is his surname or his name, or a title given to him by many allies; he is only in his forties, and can be said to be shrewd and capable. His greatest advantage is that he "deeply understands righteousness"; in modern terms, it is "a sense of justice," and he has no base behavior, so he can win people's hearts. Many villages of the same era have collapsed, but only this Old Village has always stood firm.</p>
<p>It is said that Lord Long Five's grandfather served as a military officer in the Jiawu War, and was on the path to becoming a guerrilla; upon hearing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, he immediately resigned his official position, led his subordinates, found the location of the Old Village, established the village, and settled down. When it was passed on to Lord Long Five's biological father, he worked for only a few years, and seeing that Lord Long Five was of good quality, he handed over the affairs of the village to him early, became a monk, and no longer asked about worldly affairs. At that time, Lord Long Five was only in his twenties. In terms of martial arts, in addition to the family's origins, there were also several old men under his grandfather, both literate and martial, who often gave pointers. Although the methods were old, they were the essence of literary and martial arts. In this poor mountain and remote area, they could still be applied, so in twenty years, he managed the Old Village on a very large scale.</p>
<p>The terrain of the Old Village is not special, but it is one of thousands of mountain gorges in the northeast, and behind the gorge are precipices hundreds of feet high, and outside the precipices is a dense forest. At both ends of the gorge, there were originally sheep intestines, narrow paths leading to the valley, but during the four seasons, traces could only be found during the autumn when the grass withered; in other seasons, the winter snow would not melt until March or April of the spring, and in the summer, thorny bushes would grow rampantly, and even the shadow of a road could not be seen.</p>
<p>Initially, Lord Long Five's grandfather took a fancy to a long valley within the gorge, with good land that could be cultivated into dozens of hectares of highland soil. The slopes of the two walls were not steep, and there were waterfalls and springs; anyway, the affairs of the country were unbearable to ask about, and his ambitions had been dashed, so he opened up the winding path at the east end, which could lead to the main road, and built a village in the valley, and recruited some fellow villagers and poor households from Guannei to open up this canyon.</p>
<p>When it was passed on to Lord Five's father, he opened up the narrow path at the west end for the convenience of trading due to some production in the valley. But when it came to Lord Long Five, seeing that the Japanese invasion was becoming more and more serious; first there was the "Wanbaoshan Incident," and then the September 18th Incident, he felt that this village was not easy to protect, so he discussed it with several surviving elders and decided to adopt ancient military tactics, on the one hand using military methods to control the strong laborers, and on the other hand arranging several layers of traps at the paths at both ends of the east and west. This kind of trap arrangement is called the "Qimen Dunjia" arrangement in ancient military books and war strategies.</p>

<h3>Fairness and Others</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>The Shen Chong rape case was actually denied. If a cheap　　　Kong, Zhang raped a white woman, I wonder what this would be dyed into!　　　　 , violent, ignorant human nature! In these places, we do not quite understand how Americans interpret "fairness" and "law"?</p>
<p>Japanese goods have finally arrived. In Guangzhou's street stalls, there are already smuggled clothing materials. Guangzhou's Japanese goods are taking the route of smuggling from Hong Kong, Macau, to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Once Japanese goods arrive in Guangzhou, can you prohibit them from coming to Shanghai?</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a university student and a middle school student became bandits. Everyone was not very interested in this "social news," and only regarded it as an ordinary robber and petty thief, thinking that "they brought it on themselves and cannot survive," and no one paid attention to it. Today, there is another piece of "news" saying that a middle school student has started robbing, only stealing things that look like half-sold hams; if no one teaches them again, and a young man embarks on the path of a bandit, how can they not become a big thief holding a fast rifle and jointly looting?</p>
<p>Social customs often judge people by their clothing. Even the watchmen and patrol officers have to look at a well-dressed robber with respect.</p>
<p>Therefore, the drug lord transports drugs in a "streamlined car." He has indeed learned about "social philosophy."</p>
<p>If we are to draw a dogmatic conclusion: those who ride in "streamlined cars" are likely to be "male thieves and female prostitutes."</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau's transportation vehicles have several routes that have adopted the same type of vehicle as Route 10, but some vehicles still use the old style. From the perspective of a passenger, paying the same price but receiving different treatment is unfair. The Public Utilities Bureau must not bully passengers by using bad vehicles just because there are too many people wearing uniforms.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Britain</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yang Honglie</p>
<p>— Except for children, everyone in Britain is suffering from famine!</p>
<p>Editor's note: This is a good article that is both complaining and pleading, recording the current state of poverty in Britain. It is hoped that readers will take a moment to read it. The British have a more solid national industry and all the favorable conditions than us, but after a long war, what kind of difficult and famine-stricken lives are their people living? Look, how are Churchill and the British Labour Party and their people fighting with their environment!</p>
<p>The British are lamenting, weeping, but they are tenaciously gritting their teeth, and the whole nation is united to overcome this rare difficulty!</p>
<p>On my first morning after arriving in postwar London, I called the dining room to order breakfast:</p>
<p>"Can I order breakfast now?"</p>
<p>"Of course, sir, what would you like?"</p>
<p>"Two fried eggs;——"</p>
<p>"You already got two eggs? Sir, should I come to your place to get them?"</p>
<p>"But I don't have eggs."</p>
<p>"Oh, sir,——we don't have them either!"</p>
<p>Of course, I already knew that Britain was extremely short of food, clothing, and fuel, but it was not easy to understand the truth from 3,000 miles away. After eating a meal of coarse black bread and some substitute-like jam, I suddenly felt that I was in a poor and difficult country.</p>
<p>Thin Clothes, Hungry People</p>
<p>In Britain, each person can buy two dimes worth of pork per week, about three or four taels, or buy seven cents worth of canned beef, nine taels of bread per day, three taels of butter per week, and three taels of "leiji lin," and may sometimes be able to buy an egg.</p>
<p>Thirty-two ration coupons can be used to buy clothing. A pair of leather shoes requires nine coupons, a pair of　　 three coupons, a wool vest requires seven coupons, and a set of clothes requires twenty-six coupons!</p>
<p>A car夫 once complained to me: "We are now living a hellish life. My wife and I's ration coupons are completely used on the children. We usually only have a set of casual clothes and a set of formal wear. The casual clothes have long been broken, so we only wear a formal dress all year round. Recently, Commercial Secretary Sir Cripps announced that our existing ration coupons will have to be relied on for another two months!"</p>
<p>A famous female painter who can only use electricity for a few hours each day told me that when she goes to a certain artist's studio to work in the morning, she can only use the faint light of a lighter to apply lipstick.</p>
<p>I once talked to a wife who was always angry and anxious. In fact, she is a well-known writer on both sides of the Atlantic. Here, I can only conceal her name.</p>
<p>"I stood in a long line for two hours, waiting to buy bread, fish, and vegetables, and then washed them casually. Without milk, eggs, or beef, I cook them plainly and eat them. If a person from a country that is slightly able to feed itself runs to Britain, they will definitely become yellow and emaciated and starve to death in a few months."</p>
<p>People's anxiety is indeed out of helplessness. Although it is now hot weather, occasionally a gust of wind and a sudden rain make it feel like autumn. From people's thin faces, it seems that they are frowning, and they seem to be worried that the severe winter is coming soon.</p>
<p>In the courtyard, the green grass is like a carpet, and all kinds of flowers are blooming, truly colorful. A slender willow tree hangs long, and everything still seems so tranquil and harmonious. Suddenly, a military bugle sound came from the street, the drums thumping, a team of soldiers walked by, followed by a team of Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>"These children seem to be quite strong. They seem to have good nutrition on weekdays," I said to myself.</p>
<p>The car夫 nodded in agreement: "Indeed, the only ones who eat well in Britain today are the children. The best food in the family is eaten by them."</p>
<p>At the invitation of a lawyer and his painter wife, I went to see a vaudeville show. We arrived at the theater at seven o'clock, because the "Light Conservation Movement changed the time to make it flat, but it was actually only five o'clock in the afternoon. Most people sat waiting listlessly. A few witty words from an actor on stage also aroused a burst of noisy applause.</p>
<p>"You endure　months　　this　　iron land. The first act of the play may pass in the　　 noise, while in the second act your empty stomachs growl, and in the third act you will definitely collapse and 　!"</p>
<p>Churchill's Talk</p>
<p>When I met with some British political leaders, my initial impression of Mr. Churchill was not very good. When I went to visit him at his home, he led me to an art room with high murals and lined with easels. As I passed through the easels, I saw an excellent snow scene painting.</p>
<p>"This　", I said, "should be one of the best paintings!"</p>
<p>I looked at the host's face, which seemed to have an incredible smile on it, and answered in his clear, powerful, and somewhat seductive tone;</p>
<p>"This painting is the work of someone else."</p>
<p>"Which of these are your masterpieces!"</p>
<p>"My paintings have been sent elsewhere."</p>
<p>(Weeks later, the author learned that Churchill's painting, indeed under the name of Winter, won first place in the national exhibition)</p>
<p>Churchill, wearing a not very neat air-raid suit, strong and vigorous, with a smile on his face, walked up the stairs of the Chatter, Myler residence, lay down on the sofa, a small　　, nimbly climbed onto his shoulder, staring at me unblinkingly. That house had been the residence of many British sages, and Henry VIII had also lived there. Churchill is now residing there as a guest of the government, but in a few decades, his　place may become a memorial place admired by thousands of people, just like President Roosevelt's Hyde Park.</p>
<p>He spoke eloquently. He always advocated that the United States and Britain should have close　 connections and mutually supportive cooperation. (Above)</p>

<h3>Naughty Cat Amy (5)</h3>
<p>— Made by Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>A Week in Film</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>The impoverished content of "Green Green Grass by the River"</p>
<p>"Green Green Grass by the River" is adapted from the Western film "Waterloo Bridge." It is obvious that this adaptation is a failure. Chinese and Western customs are different, and the story taken from "Waterloo Bridge" cannot take root on Chinese soil. In the play, the male and female protagonists, Wang Zichao and Lan Qing, in a short period of time, from encounters by carriage, admiration, to passionate love and engagement, this is an American-style "romance." Therefore, Lan Qing's deception and loss of virginity, falling into prostitution, remarriage, and the runaway on the wedding night, are merely plot constructions. The author did not delve into the depth of life, making this tragedy of the era feel empty and weak. Moreover, although "Waterloo Bridge" is a moving tragedy, it contains, to some extent, an anti-feudal theme, which "Green Green Grass by the River" attempts to express is quite vague.</p>
<p>In addition to the inherent deficiencies in the script's creation, director Fang Peilin should be considered quite unsuccessful. Aside from relying on some of the scenery of the Fuchun River to set off the story, those dramatic scenes are handled extremely stiffly and monotonously. As a result, the entire film lacks a kind of mournful and lingering sentiment, tasting like chewing wax. This is naturally a matter of the director's ability.</p>
<p>Wang Danfeng's Lan Qing, apart from possessing a beautiful appearance, still needs exploration for the creation of the character's personality. Yan Jun's engineer Wang Zichao is a completely foreignized young man, superficial and affected. The better performances in the entire play are Zheng Min's Manager Shen and Zi Ling's mother.</p>
<p>The exterior scenes of the Fuchun River and the scenery of the mountain city show the beauty of the former and the clumsiness of the latter in terms of photography and set design.</p>
<p>The Literary Film "Portrait of Dorian Gray"</p>
<p>As a literary film, this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray," is a great distance from the original. It can be said that the current and Wilde's aesthetic philosophy and the theme of the original painting have a high degree of distortion and alienation. In fact, this is a common problem with Hollywood's production of literary films. Producers only take a relatively superficial part of the original story and ignore or tear apart the original, and even fail to grasp its theme.</p>
<p>Thus, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is rewritten into a horror film expressing the pursuit of carnal desires and criminal psychology.</p>
<p>However, if we put aside the issue of the original work and adaptation, then we cannot but praise the outstanding achievements of director Albert Lewin. His grasp of the overall tone of the play, the control of the atmosphere and rhythm of the entire play, and the neatness of many layouts and hints, all make you feel the director's overflowing talent. Especially that scene where Dorian Gray stabs the painter Basil after Basildon is a moving shot that amplifies grays emotions.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Hurd Hatfield, who plays Dorian Gray, is perfectly cast. George Sanders as Lord Henry and Lowell Gilmore as the painter Basil are both very stable and competent.</p>
<p>The photography is also excellent in this film.</p>
<p>Excellent Cartoon "The Lost Letter"</p>
<p>It is the first time that a Soviet color cartoon has been screened in Shanghai. After watching "The Lost Letter," we feel surprised. Because when compared to those Hollywood's elaborate and ingenious cartoons, this one appears rough. Especially the Ukrainian wilderness and Cossacks under the pen of the great master Gogol, appear lively and powerfully expressing their kinship. This should be considered a successful product.</p>
<p>"Kiss and Tell" and "The Thin Man Goes Home"</p>
<p>The former is a light British-style comedy starring Shirley Temple and Robert Cummings. The latter is another work by MGM, co-starring Alan Curtis and the dog star Asta. These two films are below average.</p>
