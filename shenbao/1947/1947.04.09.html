<p>中共濫發邊幣　共區物價驚人</p>
<p>〔中央社延安八日電〕偽「邊幣」在中共控制硤北時，即已毫無價値，一般百姓，視同廢紙。其與法幣比値，爲廿對一，即「邊幣」二十元，換法幣一元。中共見其幣價日落，知難取信民間，另發「商業流通券」一種，初定「邊幣」廿元兌「流通券」一元，今年元月因其發動春季攻勢，軍需浩繁，强迫提高比率，規定「邊幣」七元，換法幣一元。「流通券」一元，換法幣三元，但各種僞幣，只發不收，民間不許儲存金銀，亦不准使用法幣，必須向「邊區銀行」兌換「邊幣」或「流通券」後，始准在市面通用。延安物價在中共統治時，較國內任何地方均高，黃米每石售「邊幣」一百四十萬元，麥每石一百廿萬元，小米八十餘萬元，高梁四五十萬元，白布每尺一萬八千元，色布每尺三萬一千元，燒餅一個四千元，油酥一千元，油條一個四千元，火柴一小盒四千元。</p>

<h3>行總豫分署長報告　黃泛區善救工作　復堤尙需時日災區亟應重建</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總河南省善救工作，目前已由堵口復堤而進入黃泛區復興之階段。該署河南分署署長馬傑，昨日下午三時特偕副署長潘澄侯，聯總河南分署代表哈特及泛區重建呼籲團代表尙少衡等，在都城飯店舉行記者招待會，報吿豫省災情，及黃河堵口復堤暨過去與今後之善救工作。　席間馬署長再三聲稱：「復興河南農業，河南可成爲中國糧食倉庫」。堵口工作已於上月十五日如期完成，但復堤尙須時日，黃泛區因災情嚴重，難民衆多，復因內戰之故，救濟及復興作工異常困難。</p>
<p>行總分署工作</p>
<p>河南分署之工作，一方面舉辦福利救濟事業，一方面進行建設。農業方面，盡量設法供給農具，肥料，種籽等。就水利方面言，曾以工賑興修河南境內最有經濟價値之三大渠，即湍惠，中和，公興三渠，共可灌田十五萬二千畝。其他工程如鑿井二千眼，浚塘一千個，興修公路七百公里，以及其他小型工振。福利事業方面，如：補助慈幼救濟機關，免費供應營養品，遍設粥廠，設平價食堂，修建難民新邨，設工藝訓練班。此外，黃泛區特另設各種福利事業機構等。</p>
<p>黃河泛區災情</p>
<p>繼由潘副署長報吿黃泛區災情，謂：河南省被淹縣份計二十縣，其中有十縣較輕，但一般災况，實悽慘萬分，賣兒鬻女，牽衣號哭，草根皮樹，亦被羅掘殆盡，自黃河改歸故道，難民已紛紛回籍，然謀生依舊乏術。</p>
<p>農村必須健全</p>
<p>哈特氏對於若干靑年放棄學業，大學學位，而前往參加黃泛區救災工作，表示極大之欽佩。同時對馬署長以及善救工作人員服務精神，亦深爲感動。渠並稱：中國百分之八十之人民皆爲農民，爲建設一新中國，建立健全之農村經濟，實爲重大任務，而欲完成此項任務，必須依賴在艱苦困難中生活之農民，吾人當盡力救濟協助，而中國同胞之努力爲國，此其時矣。</p>
<p>呼籲團之希望</p>
<p>呼籲團一部份代表現正在京請願，尙少衡則代表在此呼籲，對行總工作表示感激，但謂堵口乃消極工作，重建泛區方爲積極工作，故希望三點：（一）時間問題，希望重建工作要趕快去做，否則過二年，目前可耕地將成不毛。（二）機構問題，希望能統一健全，勿使成一個計劃一個機構之現象。（三）向國內及各國請求更多之財力與物力之帮助。</p>
<p>會間，本市若干記者曾要求往泛區一行，以便實地視察災情，當由馬署長等允與當局接洽後答覆。馬氏定今日返豫。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>國營事業配售民營辦法之檢討</h3>
<p>自「經濟緊急措施方案」公怖後，政府卽準備將國營事業讓渡民營，並多方與上海工商界交換意見。現「國營事業配售民營辦法」，已經國府核准，於七日公怖，全文刋昨日本報。這個辦法，根據「經濟緊急措施方案」第一條丁項所訂。其目的是誘政游資，以平衡預算。國營事業讓渡民營，乃整個措施方案中，最得民間同情的一項：因實施辦法久議未決，頗引起民間的疑竇，現在辦法旣公怖，則國營事業讓渡民營，必於最近期內實現，此一經濟界的大事，其發展，其結果，自爲工業界曁社會人士所重視！</p>
<p>綜觀「國營事業配售民營辦法」，計有八條，關於出售國營事業的部門及方式，均作原則上的規定。以言出售事業的範圍，計（一）中國紡織建設公司，先行出售七成，其餘三成，曹由公司繼續經營：（二）中國水產公司中華烟草公司等八單位，全部售予民營；中國紡織機器製造公司原有官股四成亦全部售予民營；（三）原設國營公司，如中國蠶絲公司中國鹽業公司，先就股份五成，向人民發行股票，公開出售。以言出售方式，凡中紡中烟等事業之部份售予或全部售予，槪由主管機關組織專門委員會。依據市塲價格及營業狀况，估訂出售價格，於六個月內有效。各出售事業，採公開投標方式，較大者由收購人組織股份有限公司，將一定股票，公開招募並得在交易所開招。至原設國營事業公司發行股票辦法，係由公司向人民及其營業組織發行，國立行局不得收購。官股與民股採平等精神，將來依公司法改組，互無特權。其餘五成官股，政府認有售予人民必要時，仍售予民營。關於這個辦法，所指的出售事業部門。其輕重如何，且不置論，惟出售方式，從簡單的內容中，已窺知技術上的問題很多，實有研討的必要。</p>
<p>先言出售方法。依規定，中紡係出售七成，幷不全部出售。按中紡爲一龐大約有機組織，共有七十一個廠，計上海二十六，靑島十二，天津十三，東北十。其性質包括棉紡，印染，毛紡，麻，絹絲，機械及附屬單位。如出售方法，不能配合出售，或僅出售印染而無紡織，或出售紡染而又把握機械，則民間經營自必困難叢生。尤其價格方面，勝利後的估價，中紡所有工廠價値已超出二萬億以上，其他原料共値一萬億至一萬五千億以上，共値三萬五千億之多。如今次配售，以「市塲價格」和「營業狀况作標的，値此物價上漲，原料騰貴之今日，是否合乎民間要求，誘導游資的興味，此時尙未敢樂觀。至中蠶中鹽，不採全部配售方式，係由公司發行五成股票，作用在招商股，幷非民營，辦法上依然是國營。如此，所謂國營事業配售民營，是「國營」「民營」滲雜，與澈底的轉讓政策仍有距離。所以說，關於出售方法，尙有待主管機關，在政策上和技術上，作合理的決定。</p>
<p>國營事業售予民營，政府勢在必行，而民間亦期待已久。我們希望最得民間同情的此一措施，政府在技術上必須多作檢討，幷博取民間意見；政策上不妨放寬尺度，切勿持「待善價而沽」的態度；縱使便宜民問，亦無損於國庫，且可收扶助民族資木之效。我們認此項問題的重要，茲作下列意見，以爲主管機關之參考。</p>
<p>一，政府應從速公佈配售事業之價格。委員會對價格之估計，工廠機件之記置，應滲入工業界曁民間之意見，使之合理，以收誘致游資，扶助民營政策之效。如獨斷獨行，民間必觀望不前。</p>
<p>二·標賣對賣方有利，因賣方必以投標之最高額售予，中華烟草公司等最能獲利之企業，可用標售方式，共他部門或規校較大者，應儘先由收購人組織公司，自發股票。同時，關於發行股票的地點，似亦不可限上海一隅，可同時於全國各地普遍發行，一方面避免大戶操縱股票，一方面可限制調換中紡之股額，而以其他國營事業，搭配之。</p>
<p>三·必須杜絕豪門資本的操縱活動。現今豪門資本，對中國經濟的控制，事實無可否認。此决國營事業之配售，必須讓民間工業眞正樹立起來，如果爲豪門資本所收購，將來對國家人民的危害，實可憂可懼。日本三菱三井，殷鑑不遠，不可不察！</p>
<p>四·各項國營事業改歸民營以後，是否能享受國營時期各種便利，似應加以注意。假如未來的民營工業，仍如往昔的處境，遭受賦稅高利及原料統制的苦厄，生產必趨萎縮，民營工業仍不能健全的樹立起來。爲欲求未來民營工業單位增加後的繁榮，政府於當前又必須有合理的工業政策，予轉讓後的民營工業，各種事業上發展的便利。</p>
<p>總之，國營事業出售民營，爲民間所擁護，爲工業界所盼望的一件措施。現在辦法公佈，出售事業的範圍確定，而技術上招來的問題正多，關係甚大，希望政府速作決定，並博取民間意見，對於這件措施，不要偏從財政上着眼，而應從國家工業政策上着力，則國營事業出售民營的意義，必為民間擁護，它的成功，在經濟史上必有燦爛的成果！</p>

<h3>美國援助希土兩國方案　葛羅米柯猛施抨擊　謂此舉等於干涉希土內政　英代表賈德幹完全支持美國立塲</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖七日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯今日在安理會中發表演說，指責美國援助希臘及土耳其之政策，就聯合國機構言，實屬越俎代庖。渠云：「美國力辯其援助希土之行動，有助於增强聯合國機構之力量，與聯合國機構之原則及目標莫不相符。此項聲辯，實難以令人同意。美國之行動，不但不足以增强聯合國機構之地位，且足以削弱其地位損害其職權，足以令人懷疑聯合國機構眞正之目標，妨碍國與國間友好關係之發展。」</p>
<p>關於美國擬派教練至希臘一事，葛羅米柯稱：無人能否認此舉構成對希臘內政之干涉，爲對於該國獨立之嚴重打擊。希臘人民理應獲得較美國對待希臘更尊敬之待遇。援助希臘，應以希臘人民之利益爲前提，決不可成爲外國在希勢力之工具。以言土耳其，就其在上决戰爭中之地位而言，實不應有權取得外界之援助，蓋土耳其在戰爭期內，並失蒙有損害故也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖七日電〕葛羅米柯在安理會抨擊美國援助希土兩國之計劃後，英代表賈德幹加以答覆稱：聯合國不能以希臘所需要之援助給予該國，故英國贊成之美國計劃，此舉乃與聯合國之原則完全符合，賈氏繼亦贊成美代表所提在巴爾幹設立一常設委員會，負責警衛巴爾幹各國疆界一項建議。澳大利亞代表荷琪對於美國動議，亦表贊同。敍利亞代表柯萊則要求安理會擱置希臘問題，主張待接獲聯合國巴爾幹調查委員會之報吿後，再行提出討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖七日電〕聯合國安理會今日決定延至星期四再行討論希臘問題，事前，對於蘇代表葛羅米柯建議將援希問題移交聯合國辦理，及美代表奧斯汀建議巴爾幹調查團繼續留在希臘以待安理會決定處理辦法兩案，均未付表決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖八日電〕蘇代表葛羅米柯七日夜在安理會猛烈抨擊美國之「片面行動」，以杜魯門總統援助希土方案爲干涉兩國內政。葛氏提議，援助希臘應由安理會特設委員會處理，將使聯合國機構有權與以監督，此事殊出意外，各國代表今日已急電本闕政府謂示。蘇聯提議所引起之第一個反應，即使人感覺其所擬監督，必將切實規定不得以援助款項供任何軍事用途，但此爲美國方案中主要目的之一，故其提議殊難爲美方所接受。</p>
<h3>討論援助希土方案　美參院完成準備　范登堡或將答覆蘇指責</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕參議院今日已完成手續，準備於星期二討論援助希臘與土耳其方案，不顧蘇聯代表葛羅米柯所謂此項方案破壞聯合國機構。參院外交委員會主席范登堡稱，渠或將答覆葛氏昨日在聯合國安全理事會之指責。其他各參議員見解不一。民主黨參議員喬治稱，「葛氏以聯合國保衛者自居，似屬不近人情。吾人嘗千方百計昭示吾人並不丟棄聯合國機構，反欲加以增强。」民主黨參議員裴柏則贊同葛氏之提議，認爲蘇聯願意共同援助希臘。裴柏並提議美國將救濟希臘之資金交與聯合國機構，而以對希土兩國軍事援助問題交由安全理事會辦理。共和黨參議員史密斯稱，渠認爲葛氏之反響出於自然，但不承認美國丟　聯合國。據稱，「余以爲奧斯汀之聲明，益以范登堡之修正案，使聯合國機構引入其間，殊爲正當。」民主黨參議員麥克倫則在參院審查委員會中提議美國對蘇聯及其七個附庸國斷絕一切財政援助。麥氏要求修正三億五千萬美元之對外救濟法案，禁止以現款援助蘇聯·阿爾巴尼亞·匈牙利·捷克·波蘭·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞與保加利亞，因此一法案與杜魯門總統之援助希土阻止共產主義法案勢難並存，且屬矛盾。</p>
<h3>華萊士抵英　談游歐任務</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：華萊士今抵此，完成其歐游之第一階段，據其在機塲中語記者稱：目前世界危機，極爲嚴重。並謂，國與國之間若無眞正之互解，則決無聯合之可言，華氏將逗留至十七日離英。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約七日電〕前商務部長華萊士今日在登機赴英之前談稱，渠此去　有美國數百萬進步份子對於歐　有力進步民主份子之善意及友情。各前進份子必須連合起來，蓋世界之和平及人民的福利，實以此項團結爲據。渠述及美國援助希土之計劃，謂當渠任商長時，即贊成援助希臘之計劃，當時反對者頗多，而渠仍竭力創導，但渠從不主張對希　從事軍事援助，此項主張至今不變。渠在辭職時即聲明反對一切形式之帝國主義，不論係英國或美國之帝國主義。華萊士復認參議員范登堡所提修正案，使聯合國機構在某種條件下得以干涉美國援助希土，爲一良好的姿態。渠認有關世界和平之任何事件，均應由聯合國機構處理。華萊士此次赴歐，意在獲取普通一般人民對於美國外交政策之反響，並擬與各歐洲政府領袖會晤，以謀增强聯合國機構之任務，並提助國際復興計劃。</p>
<h3>英工黨團體　抨擊貝文政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦七日電〕刻在莫斯科出席四外長會議之英外長貝文，今日再度受工黨內有力團體對其「有害」外交政策之抨擊。在復活節日內，出席合作黨年會及較小規模之總工會會議之甚多代表，已通過決議，要求改變貝文之外交政策。按合作黨爲工黨之一重要部份，合作黨幾有二分之一反對貝文之外交政策。</p>
<h3>蘇聯採取拖延政策　外長會毫無成就　德政體問題討論無結果</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科八日廣播：過去四週英美在外長會議中，對蘇聯輒避免作正面之抨擊，但在昨夜會議中已公然指斥蘇聯赤化德國之企圖。馬歇爾企圖積極討論議程之後半節，但在過去十日中，屢遭莫洛托夫之留難，馬歇爾對此極表不滿，一二日中將有更嚴厲之表示，聲明美方無法再事退讓，蘇聯若不中止其阻撓政策，則會議必將無疾而終。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科八日電〕馬歇爾與貝文昨晚均間接指責蘇聯企圖利用德國人民作爲工具，以確保共黨能在德國政府中佔多數位置。昨日蘇聯堅持要求舉行德國人民之公民投票，以決定是否應有堅强之中央政府或聯邦政府。英美法即斥之爲對世界和平之威脅。馬歇爾稱，「美國不願德國有可能變爲獨裁政府之中央政府，此將爲世界和平之威脅，美國僅欲德國有寄託於各洲之中央政府」。</p>
<p>渠並謂，「在今日或最近期內欲使德國人民表示其眞正民意爲不可能者，制定憲法爲非常複雜之程序，在過渡時期中舉行公民投票，對和平必極度危險」。</p>
<p>貝文並提醒莫洛托夫稱，堅强之德政府已兩决繫起世界大戰，而希特勒即在此種政治機構下，以公民投票作爲工具而攫取政權。「余決不贊成英國安全將由德國人民加以決定之建議」。馬歇爾又批評公民投票可能造成「外長會議之會員國以德國人民爲工具，而玩弄政治手腕之印象」。貝文則謂，「莫洛托夫先生之建議，在理論上或有根據，然爲安全計，余決加反對，余根本不問德國之政府是共產主義者，社會主義者，或獨裁者，余所關心者，爲和平耳。」莫洛托夫亦反唇相譏稱，貝文之立塲乃眞能造成四强欲分割德國之印象。貝文答稱，渠已同意德國之統一，然中央政府之權力，必須有限制耳。渠直不欲再討論如此重要之問題可移交德國人民決定之意見。馬歇爾稱，公民投票可待德國永久憲法制定後，由盟國之批准而舉行。經過三小時半之激辯後，此問題遂擱置，而討論明日之議程。馬歇爾建議討論德國國境，魯爾，萊茵，與美國所提之德國解除武裝案，莫洛托夫加以反對，渠欲先解決各項懸案，馬歇爾遂亦同意。貝文對星期來之毫無協議並尙有十四項議程根本未曾討論，表示厭倦與不耐。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科八日電〕美方人士今日聲稱：除非蘇方在外長會議停止其橫施阻撓之策略，吾則整個會議，結束在即。會議中蘇外長莫洛托夫與西方國家外長間之攤牌，已在形成中。基本問題厥爲四國是否仍須繼續從長計議德國問題，抑可轉而討論邊界及其他事項，並對奧國有成立協議可能。關於德國，問題已經詳細商議，各國意見，現均說明，已無從再談，如果蘇方不願討論其他事項，則會議將吿結束。據西方外交官意見，蘇方建議准許德國人民投票自擇將來政府之方式，其目的乃在藉此抵銷蘇方要求賠償一百億美元，對於德國人民所產生之反響。</p>
<h3>四外次完成　奧和約報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科八日廣播：討論對奧和的之四强外决會議，今日宣佈結束草擬對奧和的之工作，並通過英美建議，即日起延會，四外决已完成對各外長之報吿，除非四外次再頒佈命令，彼等不再討論對奧和約。</p>
<h3>議程十四項　尙未獲協議</h3>
<p>〔路通社莫斯科七日電〕外長會議已於今日進入第四週，代表相互指摘，使進展甚爲困難。今日開會因調整委員會之報吿提出較遲，故開始會議亦遲一小時。關於設立德　臨時政府之問題，經一度討論仍無協讓，祗得再交調整委員會覆議。今尙待外長會議討論者，猶有十四點之多，計（一）經濟　統一；包括工業水凖及賠償；（二）調整委員會之再一報告；（三）討論盟管會報吿書內其餘事項之特別委員會之報吿；（四）人口問題，包括流亡人民及職爭俘虜；（五）德國軍事動力之解除；（六）外次會關於訂立德和約程序之報吿；（七）外次會就盟國賠償會之報吿；（八）外次會關於較小盟國意見之報吿；（九）土地問題，包括魯爾萊茵之未來；（十）美國建議之四强公約；（十一）煤斤專家之報吿；（十二）　國和約（外長尙未開始討論）；（十三）特里埃斯特特別財政委會之報吿，（十四）限制駐德佔領軍之問題。</p>
<h3>壽臻耄耋富埒王公　汽車大王福特病逝</h3>
<p>〔合衆社　　根州底特　八日電〕福特汽車公司發言人本日發表簡單聲明稱：「亨利福特於七日下午十一時四十分病逝她埃旁寓所」。　　特為英國之汽車大王，生於一八六三年七月卅日，享年八十三歲，一生致力於汽車事業，曾手創舉世聞名之福特汽車公　，任該公司董事長之職者達十八年（一九〇一至一九一九）。福特　有獨子一人，巳於一九四三年五月亡　，現　　下髮　及孫兒二人，一名奔遜福特，一名亨利福特第二，後者即爲福特汽車公司董事長之承繼人云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社底特律八日〕福特死因尙朱截悉。福特循例於冬季赴喬治亞之福特別　，一星期前返家時，據聞精神尙極　爍。綜氏一生，早歲身在田間，沒沒無聞，後藉親友之助，以二萬八千元投資汽車工業，竟能積累至十億之鉅，成爲世界一大富豪。</p>
<p>〔合衆社底特律八日電〕福特逝世時，適大雨如注，致電力受阻，故室中僅以蠟燭及煤油燈取火，並燃木取暖。在其逝世前四小時，爾特猶往勞琪河畔之工廠巡視，調查該處風災損失。在福特牀前送終者爲其妻及一僕。當時電話亦受阻，故由其汽車夫駕車急召醫生，待逝世半小時後，方行趕到。據其繼承人福特第二稱，福特係因腦溢血逝世。</p>
<h3>葛羅米柯論裁軍　主張早日設立裁軍機構　反對英美所提裁軍辦法</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖七日電〕蘇聯今日聲明反對英美所陳在聯合國機構得以裁减軍備以前，應先確立安全保陣制度之意見。蘇代表葛羅米柯吿聯合國裁軍委員會稱：去年十二月聯合國全體大會通過之裁軍決議案，並未顯示裁軍必先設立安全制度爲先決條件，亦未規定必須設立如英美代表所要求者之安全保證。該決議案並未直接或間接述及在裁軍以前須先確立保障，反之該決議案且指出裁軍機構有早日設立之必要。軍備裁减以後，自然能促進國際之安全及信任。葛羅米柯繼重申蘇聯政府之立塲謂：最緊急之步驟，即爲訂立公約，防止原子能供作戰之用。如無此一公約，甚難甚至不能順利解決國際管制原子能之問題。國際管制原子能雖屬絕對必要，但與裁軍係屬兩事。葛羅米柯又反對英國所生張在聯合國機構開始裁軍以前，應建立聯合國陸軍以維持安全之議。就執行裁軍案之觀點而論，此一建議殊屬不佳，足以阻碍裁軍之進行。</p>
<h3>美不欲使韓分裂　霍奇論南韓樹立政權問題</h3>
<p>〔亞東社漢城八日電〕最近自美返韓之霍奇將軍今日上午十時在軍政廳舉行記者招待會，就樹立朝鮮政府問題，發表談話稱：余在美就朝鮮問題曾與杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿及其他政府要員面談多次，返美時間雖短，但已盡最大努力，使美國朝野人士認識朝鮮問題。目前美國對韓政策絕拒非樹立南朝鮮單獨政府，使朝鮮南北分裂；反之，美國正欲朝鮮樹立民主統一的政府。關於此次南朝鮮總選舉後組織之政府，係使朝鮮人自己行使行政權與司法權，但並非將全部主權讓與此政府。至於統一朝鮮問題，霍奇將軍發表，只須蘇聯接受美國提案，履行莫斯科三外長會議決議案，隨時均可再開美蘇共同委員會，討論組織朝鮮民主統一的臨時政府問題。</p>
<h3>日本首相主張　建聯合內閣</h3>
<p>〔亞東社東京八日電〕甫自鄉間返京之吉田首相，七日就目下政局發表談話稱必須在舉國一致的聯合之下始能安定政局，吉田謂民主政治必須各政黨皆保持相當之勢力，相互提携，使政治趨於民主化。以此，余認爲此時必須避無謂之政爭，在經濟上重建日本，而在日本經濟重建以前，各政黨在政治上必須協力一致。余之建立聯合內閣之構想，乃基於此信念。</p>
<h3>佛國淪為地獄　聖雄徬徨無計</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新德里七日電〕甘地今日聲稱，孟加拉省諾海里區之宗教衝突，似欲使印度教徒在熱狂之中抉擇死生。甘地發表國大黨黨員自諾海里來電，說明該區回教徒擬將印度教徒活焚。甘地已電各該黨員自行決定印度教徒應吾退出該區，並電孟加拉回盟政府領袖蘇拉華第，促其迅速恢復治安。</p>
<h3>印度英軍司令　歐慶萊將留職</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里八日電〕印度英軍總司令歐慶萊元帥頃在高級軍官集會席上談稱，某種改革方案即將實行，此舉恐將使印度陸軍人數大爲减弱，總額將减至二十萬人，艦隊則將由陸軍部隊加以補充。據聞歐慶萊在印度極孚衆望，復因　易以印度人出任司令長官一職，恐又將引起印回兩派間之新鬥爭，故衆料歐氏徇印政府之要求，殆仍將在印度留任原職。</p>
<h3>緬甸着手組織　十萬革命軍</h3>
<p>〔路透社仰光七日電〕前緬甸臨時政府委員，最近所成立「緬甸人的緬甸」運動領袖巴森今日在此談稱，渠已着手組織革命軍十萬人，以與英帝國主義及反法西斯人民自由聯盟奮鬥。</p>
<h3>美國烟煤礦　幾已全部停工</h3>
<p>魯易士地位漸見增强</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕美國全國烟煤　　巳全部停工，官方人土亦承認礦工聯合會主席魯易士之地位，以視其去年十一月號召礦工罷工時，尤爲堅强，魯易士現以煤礦不安全爲由而下令礦工罷工，政府當局殆無法再要求法庭下令禁止礦工罷工。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕美政府本日宣稱：在礦工聯合會主席魯易士領導下之四十萬烟煤礦工中，巳有五萬四千人不　魯易士之命令而恢復工作，但大部份礦工仍堅決擁護魯易士，政府事實上對「安全罷工」竟毫無辦法。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社里斯本七日電〕西班牙王位繼承人唐璜今晚向全國人民發表宣言，正式聲明其本人不擬放棄其繼承王位之不可否認之權利。內稱：弗朗哥之王位繼承法，並未計及西班牙有設立堅定制度之必要，亦未計及世界仇視西班牙主要原因係由於弗朗哥身爲西班牙元首所致之一項事實。弗朗哥之建議，僅足以使其在君主政體之美名掩護下終身獨裁云。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕業已舉行罷工之全國電話工人聯合會主席貝爾恩與聯邦調解主任華倫舉行四十五分鐘之商談後，昨晚吿報界稱，該會已準備舉行長期罷工，「停止全國卅二萬五千電話工人罷工之談判無新發展。吾人幷未接得政府解決罷工之建議。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕美國歷史上第一次全國性電話罷工，已使長途電話百分之八十斷絕，各區電話亦多停頓。但官方稱，調解工潮進行順利，紐約州吉姆斯城罷工工人已迭受加薪百分之九一條件，首先結束罷工。</p>

<h3>日本普選面觀</h3>
<p>…這種選舉，不過是各黨對政治機構之爭，日本人在依照盟國願望實行澈底自治之前，仍須長期的再敎育。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京七日電〕嚴肅的日本人本月內正在舉行四大選舉，他們覺察麥帥最近提出及早締結對日和的的建議已激起全世界對日本政局的注意。日本各報都稱這是日本當前的「重大試煉」。這種選舉目的在肅淸舊憲法，實施五月三日起生效的放棄戰爭的新憲法。依照盟國觀察家們預測，這種選舉大抵忠實，而無紛擾，證明此一依然半封建的國家正繼二向民主政治進展。但根本上不過是各黨對政治機構之爭，日本人在依照盟國願望實行澈底自治之前，仍須長期的再敎育。</p>
<p>本月份內四大選舉</p>
<p>投票自四月五日開始，第一爲縣長市長與村長的選舉，這是日本歷史上創舉，以前地方官都是任命的。其次爲四月二十日參議院議員三百席的選舉，參議院將代替從前的貴族院。再隔五日選民又將選舉衆議院議員四百六十六席。到四月三十日，還要選舉縣市村的參議會議負。</p>
<p>左右兩派互相對立</p>
<p>在各種選舉中，幾千個候選人，包括女子百餘人在內，巳申請考核其履歷，他們在獲准參加競選之前，必須證明戰時並無黷武的言行。所有各决選舉中的根本問題，就是左右兩派的對立，換言之，就是現狀與社會主義或更激進的方案之對立。社會民主黨提議主要工業立即收歸國營，以便完成社會主義。共產黨則大呼「平民的權利」。保守派各大黨並無明顯的政綱，只有和調吉田首相領導的自由黨（名爲曰由實係保守）可望在衆議院多得三十席，併入原有之席數，將爲一百七十席，果然是一個多數黨了，但仍遠不能成爲過半數黨。自由黨的希望，寄於舊官僚政治機構的多宗遺產及最近公衆對勞工策略的反感，勞工方面大抵與社會黨與共產黨一致。進步黨爲保守派第二大黨，預料其失去的席數，將與自由黨所贏得的席數，不相上下，但可保持相當的力量，俾與百由黨聯合而在衆議院成爲過半數。進步黨　有九十七席。據說進步黨已決定改組，並更換黨名，以應黨中靑年積極份子的要求。吉田首相爲自由黨衆議員候選人。選舉可以給他蟬聯的機會，不管左派怎樣反對他。</p>
<p>新憲法特別規定首相必須爲議會議員。社會黨可望大獲勝利，一躍而爲第二大黨。共產黨原有衆議員六席，或可增至十五席。還有相當數目的無黨派人士，也可當選，因爲普遍日本選民仍在尋覓各黨所未揭示的中間路綫。一部份小黨或將落選。</p>
<p>進行競選費用可觀</p>
<p>麥帥總部各專家坦白承認地方選舉將爲重大問題，因舊官僚正設法利用投票而保持勢力。反對派候選人甚少。同時舊政治的作風到處可見，保守黨以數億日圓作爲競選費，甚至共產黨也耗去一千萬日圓。一部份日人揣測衆議員一人當選，代價爲五十萬日圓（一萬日圓折合美金一元），他們又預料四千萬公民將踴躍投票，但並不說明踴躍的程度。</p>

<h3>今晨茂昌堆棧奇火　門窗緊鎖猜疑火種何來　建國西路火警曾有縱火證據發現</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今晨零時廿分，茂昌公司南潯路六十號准棧二樓，突有濃烟冒出，迨路人發覺，狂鳴警笛，剎時已見火舌昇騰，黑烟蔽天。常經電告消防處，派車到塲灌救，迄本報截稿時止，火勢仍未見稍戢。</p>
<p>該處爲茂昌公司虹口辦事處，共有倉庫多所，佔地極廣。正門在黃浦路二二九號，起火處則爲南潯路倉庫，倉屋互相毘連。此起火之南潯路倉庫爲一三層樓高之鋼骨水泥房屋，其底層與二層之一部份及三樓全部，均係交通部電信局所堆置之大批電訊材料。據該公司職員談，二樓其餘地位，爲某俄人所租用，堆有葡萄乾黑棗等乾果，前日且會堆入大包棉花約計一百餘件。堆置安妥後，即經上鎖對閉門窗，倉庫內部亦並無職工駐派住宿，今長該倉庫二樓突然無故起火後，消防人員雖及時到達火塲，竟一時無法入內撲滅火源，僅賴雲梯與強有力水苗，衝破二樓窗牗，遙遙灌射。至一時許，濃黑烟柱，昇騰屋頂者，高達十數丈。記者自窗際遙望內部，亦能隱隱見火舌東西呑捲。是時亦時而偶聞一二炸裂之聲，據悉即係電信局尺許長之巨型眞空管被燃爆裂所致。此次損失之數，必甚浩大，一時尚未能獲悉其詳，唯知俱保有火險。</p>
<p>茂昌公司此一火案，起因殊爲離奇。查最近本市大火已連續發生多起，此次又爲一奇突之火案。前夜九時許，建國西路六二七號附近弄內亦曾發生火警，事後檢得燒毁蒲包一隻，滿佈火油氣息，可知必係歹徒縱火。當局對此十分注意。今晨救火時警局並出動大歡員警，手持輕機槍，嚴密戒嚴，形勢極度緊張。</p>

<h3>同濟罷課風潮擴大　對士兵毆打同學認為有組織陰謀　提出三項要求今向市府警部請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市同濟大學七號校車，於前日午後二時，由新市區法學院（院址與輜二團三營七連毘隣，由該校博物館門共同進出）駛出時，有士兵因搭車不遂，致起爭執，毆傷李博勤等學生八人，引起全體學生公憤，前日起，該校法學院及新生院一致罷課抗議。罷課風潮，且遂漸擴大，該校工學院，文理學院及醫學院等全體學生三千餘人，爲表示響應起見，今日起一致罷課。並提出三項要求：（一）駐軍立即撤離學校區域。（二）負責機關應嚴懲此次肇事官兵。（三）由軍事機關公開登報，歉，並保證今後不發生同樣事件。</p>
<p>董校長勸令復課</p>
<p>昨日下午二時，學生自治會假工學院召開全體代表緊急大會，並請該校校長董洗凡報告事後交涉經過，略稱：本次事件發生之因素，起於軍人之搭乘校車，本校校車極爲擁擠，自無法允許軍人搭乘，且公用局曾數度來函警告，校車絕對不准外客搭乘，因此而釀成衝突，誠屬憾事。事件發生後，本人曾分訪警備司令，港口司令及何參謀長等，彼等均表示萬分抱歉，並決予澈查，保證今後不發生同樣事件。又稱，軍人滋事當然錯誤，查實後必予嚴辦。董校長並表示，此事旣已由校方出面交涉，且有相當結果，切盼同學自明日起一律復課，以免徒然荒廢學業。至於博物館原屬本校所有，且市府已撥回本校應用，駐兵自應儘速撤退，此事校方正交涉中。</p>

<p>迨董校長離去後，各學院代表紛紛起立，報告目擊當日出事情形及身受侮辱經過，並一致認爲事情並未澈底解決，僅屬口頭上之保證，前固有之，而士兵每每朱予遵守，且此番土兵糾衆圍毆，顯係有組織之陰謀，因最近一月來，此種事件迭决發生，同學林偉被駐軍槍傷在前，陳達信被軍車輾傷在後，此次竟公然園毆法學院同學，故一致認爲已忍無可忍，不獲澈底解決，決不復課。學生自治會並定於今日上午推派代表，分赴市政府，警備司令部請願，如不獲得圓滿結果，將實行大遊行，並籲請本市各大學羣起響應，採取一致行動云。</p>

<h3>工業界一大計劃　建廠七所自造嫘縈　美專家來滬磋商計技術協助契約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在華懋飯店一間精緻華麗的房間內，記者和一位美國人造絲公司的代表，長談了一小時。從他的談話中，獲悉人造絲工業可能於短期內在我國建立。這位來賓是美國奧斯格柯亨公司的秘書勞爾夫柯事氏（見圖），他來華已將旬日，任務是和我國某大工業家進行談判，希望能在短期內訂立建廠的契約。</p>
<p>據柯亨說：預定在我國建立的螺縈（人造絲的新名詞）廠，一共有七個之多，其中包括三類：（一）五噸的Rayon廠三個，（二）五噸與十噸的Steple　Fiber廠各一個，（三）一噸的Cellophane廠兩個。建廠的地點是在上海附近兩百哩左右，精確的位置要取決於水源的品質和數量。資本的數目很大，據這位專家的估計，一個五噸工廠所需的全部資本，達一千萬美元之鉅，全部數字的驚人，可推算而得。不過柯亨氏力言資本是完全由國人負担的，他在美國的公司只是在技術上作全面的協助。這種制度他們呌Single　Contract　System，這裹面包括五項工作：（一）選擇建廠的地址，（二）交付所需要的機器，（三）承造一切所需的機件，（四）工廠研需的技師全部選送美國柯亨公司加以訓練，（五）由柯亨公司派遣專家來華指導，直至這七家工廠全部順利開工製造時爲止。截至昨日爲止，契約的內容尚在雙方磋商談判之中，其中有兩項實際上已無問題。他相信在本月廿五日離華之時，契的可以順利簽字。簽字之後，公司可以書面保證，於十八個月之後正式開工。柯亨不願說明與他談判的是誰，只是說過去有三個人赴美接洽，而我國駐美大使館對此亦多方促成的。</p>
<p>他一再指出在中國辦理這種工業，是十分有利的。在美國製造人造絲不過六角五分美元一磅但在中國市塲上竟要賣到三元五角美金。中國人造絲的需要量，戰前的進口量是每月三十五噸，但不包括走私在內，正確的需要量估計是七十五噸一天。以中國的面積人口觀察，人造絲工業前途未可限量。人造絲廠之建立，困難是在需要的資本太大，但是這種工業用途至廣，將來可能趕過紡織工業。</p>
<p>奧斯裕柯亨公司是美國最大的人造絲企業，成立於一九〇九年，創始者是奧斯格柯亨，就是這位來賓的父親。這家公司共擁有六十四家人造絲工廠，在美國的只有五家，其餘的都在海外，最大部份是在日本。其餘的分佈在南美和歐洲，最近又發展到了非洲。因爲事業分佈之廣，在這次戰爭中頗有損失。戰後，他們本着美國人在工業上的「浮士　」精神，向世界每一個角落去發展，經過埃及印度之後，現在又尋到了我國。</p>

<h3>西摩路火案竊盜嫌疑犯　四消防警昨審結　被告等均否認曾趁火打劫　定十五宣判申卿保未准</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案中失職消防警尚志魁，戴光榮李成鈞，蔡治英四人，因有趁餘火未熄之時，入二十七號災戶，竊取毛巾，手帕，棉毛衫等財物嫌疑，經地檢處沈祖壽檢察官依盜匪罪提起公訴。其餘隊長黃寳琦，李壎，朱慶瀾等十九人，另案以公共危險及竊盜罪起訴。昨晨十時由地院刑八庭梅爾和推事提訊犯有盜匪罪嫌之尚志魁等四被告，辯論終結，定本月十五日宣判。關於公共危險及竊盜罪部份之被告十九人，定於十五日審理。</p>
<p>梅推事點名過後，採用隔別審問。據尚志魁供：任宜昌路區消防隊警長，本年一月二十二日晚九時半，武定路四五二號銅匠作起火，延燒及六六〇弄全弄，被告奉命率屬戴光榮，李成鈞，蔡治英前往火塲灌救，其時因二十七號尚有餘火，即命蔡治英上樓灌救，戴李二人，亦上樓協助。後蔡先離去。尚供稱：任消防警，已二十一年，從未有不規行爲，所被控竊取財物之事，全非事實。戴光榮，李成鈞，蔡治英三被告，亦均否認曾趁火打劫，並謂：災戶被災後，無處洩怨，故揑造誣攀。庭上乃傳證人周企舫（二十七號屋主周秀珍之姨甥），據稱：二十三日上午八時餘火未熄，因掛念家中，設法借得長梯，從窗口爬入探視，見四消防警正翻箱倒篋搜刧財物，見其毫不規避，且令開箱，以便搜尋，並當庭指認尚志魁，李成鈞，戴光榮確係當時行劫之人。蔡治英是否亦在內，則已糢糊不淸。審訊旣畢，庭上宣告開始辯論，檢察官沈祖壽起立論告，請庭上以盜匪罪嚴懲被告等四人。被告辯護律師辯稱：取毛巾，手帕之類，乃爲揩抹水漬之用，未能謂之竊盜財物。局企舫上樓，四消防員不可能給予不能抗拒之威脅，故不足構成盜匪罪。末並申請交保，仍爲庭上駁回。</p>

<p>交通委員會方面由柴子飛代爲說明：（一）滬閔公司之合的不完備。（二）漕寳路地價未，路權未可確定。（三）地方用意以通車盈餘作地方公益。（四）地方並不抹煞閔公司過去之損失。旋經公用局副局長張仁滔發表意見：（一）未發通車執照係因該公司貼費未經付淸。（二）補付之貼費二千餘萬元，因倍數未經中央確定，以是該項給付當係非正式之暫收性質。（三）給付地價一節，二十六年市政府並無明文規定。</p>

<p>〔本報北平八日電〕教部計劃將國立北平蒙藏學校，改爲國立蒙藏學院，業誌二日本日，惟此項計劃，須蒙藏學校澈底充實整頓後，始可實現。據悉：蒙藏學校創立於民國二年，勝利之初，由蒙藏委員會接辦，最近奉政院令，改隸教育部，並派陳克孚爲校長，陳氏即北來視事。現該校爲中學性質，設有初高中六班，並爲初由蒙藏來平學生設一初習班。學生共三百三十三人中，蒙生二百十五人，藏生十八人，漢族學生百人。全校女生佔十分之二弱，計六十人，其中蒙生三十五，藏生二，餘爲漢生。其中蒙藏子弟多爲蒙藏貴族保送，內藏生三人，係駐藏辦事處遠道來自拉薩，漢生則係邊政人員子弟，或有志邊陲者。課程除增設蒙文藏文蒙藏史地外，與一般中學無異，惟爲遷就邊疆靑年，永準，略低。聞教部曾規定蒙藏學生，受公費名額爲百名，最近自邊疆來求學者甚多，已達二百卅人，故頗有僧多粥少之苦。教部爲予邊疆青年以深造機會幷從事培植邊疆幹部，已計劃在短期內將該校改爲專科性質之蒙藏學院。</p>

<p>首由校長吳保豐主席致詞，略謂：交通大學之五十一年歷史，與鈑代中國的歷史是休戚相關的。慶祝校慶，要歸功於創辦人盛宣懷。交大向來注重理工與技術，學生對於政治並不發生興趣。今後更應實事求是，養成勤樸風氣。吳校長特別提出校訓：「富貴不能淫，威武不能屈，貧賤不能移」，爲五十年來交大之傳統精神，希望永遠保持。</p>
<p>董洗凡致詞</p>

<p>吳國楨致詞</p>
<p>市長吳國楨亦發表演詞，略謂：今日在此慶祝交大五十一週紀念，回想建校初年之中國暗淡歷史，不得不痛駡上一代的未盡責任。深知上一代的錯誤，而自己趕緊勞力，那末中國還有救，就怕我們這一代將來受你們痛駡，甚而你們再讓下一代痛駡，那中國是永無希望了。爲什麼國事愈攪愈壞？——爲了沒有安定。年年兵荒馬亂，進步兩字，無從談起。所以靑年人要求進步，惟有先求國家的安定。希望交大同學，秉承其傳統精神，在自己崗位上努力，以研究充實其本身學識，而爲效力建設，明日中國之出發點。</p>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>市長盃籃球賽昨夕揭幕，美海軍哥侖布與明星隊，分戰華隊綠林·培爾，市體育館上座祗四五成。</p>
<p>明星對培爾之役，初次暴露其實力，不過一中上隊伍，全隊以動作快速，合作純熟見長，但投籃無把握，僅一羅卡斯差强人意，防守亦不嚴密，所勝培爾四球，全在籃下球佔盡優勢。</p>
<p>綠林是本屆籃球聯賽甲二組亞軍，哥侖布曾在對油隊，華聯，仁餘幾塲友誼賽中，博得好評，是一個守優於攻的隊伍，僅中鋒愛許一人靈活善射，昨夕綠林於上半時，未能防阻愛許的活躍，以五球落後。</p>
<p>下半時之初，綠林改採攻勢，急傳疾攻不能奏效，遂改用緩攻，伺機作覓空擋，走位置之近籃投擲，一路迫成二十六比二十的接近局面，但因身材高低懸殊，綠林在進攻時，出手搶接，皆有默契，而球在本籃時，反被哥侖布奪獲十之八九，綠林舒家義表演出色，全隊已盡最大努力，初登大塲，經騐與心理均有不良的影響。（昌年）</p>

<h3>兪財長招待新聞界　闡述財政金融問題　募銷美金債券力求普及決不攤派　本市物價騰紗有關方面定能平抑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部兪部長，昨日下午三時，在外灘江海關財政部長辦公室，招待本市新聞界，對所提各項有關財政金融問題多則，曾作廣泛之答覆。茲誌其大要如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於美金債券部份：（甲）對新債券募銷工作之推進，渠認爲此次債券發行目的，在於吸收游資，故發行務求普及公開，深入各地各階層，且特別須貫澈自由認購之前提，決下擬派。（乙）政府此次發行債券，以美金爲單位，此事已有先例可援，並非新創。其目的無非在使法幣回籠，穩定金融，平衡物價，並無其他用意。（丙）此次發行之債券，因各項條件，俱極懷異，基金担保，又極雄厚，且基委會職權獨立，例如担保美金公債之外匯基金，於美金公債到期還本前六個月，即須撥付基委會保管。又担保短期庫券之國營事業，如一旦出售，其出售所得之價款，即須劃歸基委會保管，故債信堅硬，相信必能推行順利。（丁）此次發行之債劵，分函期按月平均銷售，並不擬一蹴即就，故有謂目前全國行莊存款總額，不過數千億元，何能承銷該項鉅額債券，實可不必願意。（戊）至於該項債劵之用途，凡能帮助政府實現發行公債之目的者，政府均願考慮。（己）該項債券，待正式債劵印就後，當考慮准予上市。</p>
<p>政府必能維持債信</p>
<p>（二）對處理舊債之看法，渠認爲政府對償還戰前及戰時所發行之各種舊債，均能切實履行，向未延期，過去如此，現在及將來亦如此。政府對債券措施，常以顧到國家及人民之利益爲目標，以維債信，</p>
<p>（三）戰前銀行存款之償還問題，渠稱此事正由國防最高委員會縝密硏究中。蓋此事須同時並顧債權債務雙方之權益，故不得不從長計戚。一俟核定辦法，當即公布。</p>
<p>整頓稅制　平衡收支</p>
<p>（四）對開闢新稅源及開征特種營業稅問題，渠稱：財部目前推進稅政，着重調整稅制，簡化機構，整飭稅人風紀。故與其謂爲開闢新稅源，毋寗謂爲整理舊捐稅。至特種營業稅條例，刻已擬妥，正待完成立法程序後，再付施行。</p>
<p>（五）關於本年政府收支決算，較往年龐大一點，渠認爲自經濟緊急措施新方案施行後，政府一方面整頓稅收，一方面積極節流。凡非必要之支出。均暫緩撥付。而收入方面，整頓稅制結果，根據過去數月稅收情形而言，則今年稅收，必較預期爲大。同時尙將利用物資政策，向國內外拋售剩餘物資，並加緊處理敵僞產業，將國營生產事業配售民營以及發行新債券，日本之賠償等等，對政府均係龐大之收入。故在此財政經濟金融各項政策面面配合之下，相信政府收支，必能逐漸達到平衡。</p>
<p>（六）美國新貸款美金五億元之事，因尙未屆發表時期，未便透露任何意見。</p>
<p>（七）近日市食米食油紗布價格之上漲，有關方面已密切注意中，將採有效辦法，相信定能平抑之。</p>
<p>抱定方針　渡過難關</p>
<p>（八）對政府在國內戰事延續中，將如何維持收支平衡一點，渠稱：政府在不斷努力爭取和平之餘，當更根據最近中央決策，於經濟政策方面，覓求種種辦法，俾經濟金融趨於穩定。我國頻受戰禍，渡過無數難關，深望此次能再忍耐一過，堅持信念，抱定方針，則難關不難渡過。</p>
<p>（九）任何政府，在採行管理外匯政策時，對輸入貿易，勢必亦加以管理。惟政府對必需工業輸人品所需之外匯，決儘量供給。政府現有充分之外匯基金，以供給國內必需輸入品所需之外匯頭寸。</p>
<p>管理證交促使發展</p>
<p>（十）對逾期債劵，是否將予加倍還本問題，渠稱：政府對此事尙未決定。（十一）證劵交易所之業務，渠認爲一方面應嚴格管理，一方而需在合法範圍之內，使作順利之發展。（十二）國行成立貼放委員會後，外界以各行莊資力及業務範圍大小不一，或將因此而不能得到均沾之利益。渠稱：此係各行莊本身之事，當局無從調處。而當局對各行莊之貼放通則，對大小行莊，並未分別待遇云。</p>
<h3>美金債劵　基金監委會成立　李馥蓀當選為主委</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年短期庫券及美金公債基金監理委員會成立會議，於昨日中午十二時許，在中央銀行三樓會議室舉行。財政部俞部長，特親自出席主持。到委員張嘉璈，陳炳章，王曉籟，徐寄廎，李馥蓀，歐陽崙，沈日新，徐永祚，秦潤卿，吳任滄，李光前（陳維龍代），在康培，楊綿仲等。苜由兪部長致詞，略稱：今天爲民國卅六年短期庫券及美金公債基金監理委員成立會。政府爲昭示大信，所以要設立此會。監理會的職權，特別重要。依照組織規程，基金監理委員會在監理範圍之內，得獨立行使其職權。而在木息全部淸償之前，其監理權限，不得變更。故監理會對於鞏固政府債信，維護持票人權益，已山政府賦予特權。監理會於處理基金，行使職權之中，相信必定能够絕對公開切實，確實達到政府與人民的期望云云。</p>
<p>次由國行張總裁致詞，略稱：此次政府發行債券，實爲一大試金石。由此可測騐人民對國家債券，是否信仰。國行對該項俊券基金之管理，一切當遵照基金監理委員會之規定辦理。</p>
<p>旋由李馥蓀致詞，略稱：近年來人民亟望能與政府合作。現政府發行新債券，表示決心與民更始。旣已規定以若干資產及外匯基金，作爲該項債券之担保，甚望能將該項担保品，開具詳單，送交基委會備查。</p>

<h3>物價評議會　油糖等組開會　彙集意見提供大會參考</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕週來各項物價又起波動，社會局長吳開先及定提早於十日召開物價評議會大會。昨日該會食油，米糧及食糖三小組，分別召開會議，交換意見，以便提供大會，作爲議價之參攷。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>小組，出席張超等多人，由吉科長任主席，決定向大會提供實際成本，計（一）豆油：民營油廠根據九萬八千元大豆價，成本爲四十三萬五千元。中植油廠根據九萬一千元大豆價，成本爲卅九萬三千五百元。（二）蔴油：民營油廠根據上海芝蔴市價，成本爲四十一萬一千元。中植油廠根據產地販價，成太爲卅八萬三千三百元。（三）生油：民營油廠根據上海花生米市價，成本爲四十六萬五千元。中植油廠根據靑島生仁販價，成本爲卅八萬四千五百元。吉科長並囑各廠商搜集各項有關證據，於今午十二時前送社會局，以便彙集後提供大會。各廠商皆望議價有彈性，不予硬性規定。</p>
<p>米糧</p>
<p>小組，亦由吉科長主持，由出席米商報吿產地市價，互相交換意見，決定搜集資料，計算成本，提供大會作爲議價標準。</p>
<p>食糖</p>
<p>小組由邵科長主持，與會之糖商及南貨業，皆盼台糖公司能增加供應數量而不使中輟。價格方面則因外埠之土糖價較本埠爲高，影響來貨稀少。且外銷今已擴及蘭州東北等地，而上决議價係決定於去年九十月間，迄今未有變更。今因實際情形，或當酌予調整，將由十日之大會決定。</p>
<h3>全國經委討論　京滬物價問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕全國經濟委員會物價委員會，定十日召開，商討邇來京滬物價之跳漲問題，國行總裁張嘉璈曁吳市長國楨兩委員，均已被邀請來京出席。</p>
<h3>統債升降甚微</h3>
<p>公債昨過程更爲平庸，中途頗多小盤頭。統丙晨開一一七〇〇元，高價不過一二二〇〇元，價爲一一五〇〇元。結果較前收計甲乙丁各降二百元，丙升五百元，戊種亦漲二百元，成交約四百萬。</p>
<h3>三種公債　還本抽得籤</h3>
<p>財政部發行之廿五年統一公債丙種債票，廿七年國防公債及卅年建設公債第三期債票，定於四月十日午前九時在仁記路七十四號中央信託局四樓執行還本抽籤。</p>
<h3>新光股東會通過　每一老股送八股</h3>
<p>新光內衣公司昨日召開股東大會，到股東代表五百餘人，由該公司董事長傅良駿氏爲主席，報吿業務狀况及卅五年度帳略。决即討論增資方案，該公司原有資本二億一千萬元，增資爲三十八億元，其辦法除由每一老股，得以現金認購六股外，該廠曾出資三億元與建業銀團出資廿三億三千萬元合作投資新大織造廠。此次股東會通過，將該廠全部收購，即以建業銀團投資額，加入該公司爲股份。此次增資後，提撥六億五千萬元之新股，作爲收購新大廠之價値。尙有餘額十六億八千萬元，平均分配與該公司老股東，每一老股可得送股八股云。</p>
<h3>北帮買胃增強　華股繼續盤好</h3>
<p>華股昨業中人若北帮少壯派等買胃增强，永紗繼續盤好，美亞經大部份獲利多頭出籠後，頗見鬆懈，掉期迫近，中途屢有小盤頭。晨開現永紗故意做低外，餘均見高。近午由二一八號二一三號一四五號二三一號八九號四號之脫手而回跌至二八〇〇元有零，臨收仍由一九八號一五五號之維持而仍穩，收後喊價續昂，結果較前收計永紗信和華豐微升，美亞新華跌半成不到，勤興新光平平，中法漲半成强。遞交永紗信和華豐新光微升，美亞稍跌，冷股統益大通水泥升半成，餘者榮辱俱微。</p>
<p>午後二三五號一九八號九七號一八五號一七九號九五號陸續賣出，遞永紗開後步降至二七六〇元以下·六一號一一七號二二三號趁低維持，得以支持，此後因一五二號之不時活動，時有現遞倒掛之象，漸漸轉穩。迨三五號九四號九九號二二六號八九號四號一九八號一五二號連袂吸收，逐步盤高至二八七〇元。信和美亞亦吿回挺，九七號八五號七七號逢高有售而稍回落，結果較前收計勤興平平，美亞新光新華微挫，永紗華豐信和微升，中法漲一成弱。遞交計永紗信和徵升，美亞新光稍跌，華豐平平，冷股永公漲一成，水泥統益大通各升半成，榮豐火柴微降，國貨新亞尙平，餘均微升。塲外各股仍趨上漲。</p>
<h3>募銷債劵進行順利　已逾美金千萬元　張總裁聘專家組設計會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年短期庫劵及美金公債之募銷情形，昨日據各經募行局負責人報吿，總額迄已達美金一千二百萬元。其中公債五百七十萬元，庫券六百三十萬元。又各行局門市售出美金數千元不等，各商業銀行零星售出，亦不在少數。據悉：國家行局方面認購者，計中交兩行各認購三百萬元，農行二百萬元，中信局一百萬元。商業銀行認購者，計浙江實業銀行一百萬元，上海銀行一百萬元。</p>
<p>本市募銷委員會，因時間匆促，內部組織，尙未完成。聞已定在秘書長之下，分設總務，募銷，統計，及宣傳四組。總務宣傳兩組，今日起即開始辦公。</p>
<p>推銷期中暫不開拍</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中央銀行行爲促進債劵推銷工作，昨由張總裁指聘專家十九人，組織設計會議。以陳副總裁健庵爲召集人，四聯總處刁民仁，中央銀行王紫霜，李惕生，陳延祚，高方，鄔志陶，中國銀行徐廣遲，蔡公椿，潘久芬，史久驚，林旭如，交通銀行李道南，莊叔豪，朱通九，李軔哉，農民銀行王伯天，周紀曜，中信局沈　瑞，郵匯局谷春帆爲委員，昨日上午十時，在中央銀行三樓舉行第一次會議。由陳副總裁主席就（一）加強債售，（二）推銷對象，（三）推銷技術三點，分別討論，十二時散會。有人提出債劵是否由交易開拍，經反復硏討，以目前債劵推銷工作旣在順利進行，殊無開拍必要。且發行伊始，人民對債券利益，容有未盡明瞭，現時開拍亦非所宜，經議決定暫緩。</p>
<p>債券抵繳有款凖備</p>
<p>美金債券條例規定可充保證準備之用，據悉：中央銀行已允本市商營行莊之請，繳存國央存款準備金中百分之五十，得以債券抵繳云。</p>
<h3>對連日物價波動　宣司令發表談話　物價上漲影響治安　警備部將採取行動</h3>
<p>中央社記者以物價波動影響民生及治安甚鉅，昨午特訪警備部宣司令鐵吾，叩詢意見，及是否將採取平抑措施，承吿：自經濟監察團結束以後，經濟檢察之工作仍秘密進行，惟以調查爲主，不直接處理物價問題。然以最近情形視之，如物價之上漲，影響治安之安定，則警備部將直接與聞此事。宣氏除已令「經濟檢察網」各方人員，對投機操縱有據者予以查辦外，昨日下午二時，並致函市商會，盼勸吿各業勿妄抬物價，連日已抬之價格，應立即敉平，原函云：</p>
<p>函市商會勸勿抬價</p>
<p>「查連日本市物價，又吿動盪，昨日起更呈普遍上漲之趨勢，不僅平民感受重大之威脅，尤其軍警生活實不堪再事壓迫，影響所及，將使維特治安責任之人員陷於無法維持之境地，其因少數投機商人而造成之惡果，將有不堪設想者，本部目擊危機，不忍以淞滬治安爲投機商人所危害，特函請貴會轉飭各業，勿藉口供求關係，任意抬高物價，連日已抬之價格應即立謀敉平，以慰喁望而安閭里，無任切盼。」</p>
<p>投機心理死灰復燃</p>
<p>市商會接獲宣司令函後，即於當午轉文各同業公會，分飭所屬會員一體切實遵照並加吿誡「切莫輕舉妄動，以身試法」。據市商會理事長徐寄廎稱：最近物價波動之主要原因，爲投機心理之復燃，乃爲不合理之現象，政府近有美金公債之發行，擁有游資者，大可走向購買公債一途，於國於己均有裨益。若以囤積物資爲能事：而遭受法律嚴厲之制裁，實屬不智。據渠預測，宣司令之函發佈後，物價可能於一二日內重趨穩定。</p>
<p>鄭介民氏留滬監視</p>
<p>國防部第二廳廳長鄭介民將軍，自於週前來滬公幹，原定昨晚返京，詎因本市物價又有上漲趨勢，臨時中止，決暫滯滬，設法壓平物價。鄭將軍已於昨日手令經濟偵察網，加緊監視市塲工作，苟若發現操縱物價，壟斷市塲之奸商，決予嚴懲云。米市來源减少，米商格於限價，批貨不售，形勢頗爲嚴重主管經濟檢察當局，對此密加注意，昨日上午九時，警局經濟科奉宣司令交下之囤積食米密報一件，令即查辦。徐科長當即派出幹員，依據密報，至穩藏大批白米之福佑路五〇一一號調查。查得該處確存有白米一百二十餘拒，惟該屋屋主任佐卿之妻推諉責任，否認貨主。警局人員又查悉任佐卿時出入於同德里一號益興號，按址密查，始將任佐卿尋獲。據任稱，是項白米非渠本人所有，而爲渠之友名張竹銘者所寄存。張竹銘住於福佑路福佑坊十四號，業草邊帽料進出口生意。經警局傳詢，供稱白米已購多時，並無囤積之意。警局令張竹銘，任佐卿兩人具保後，該案已呈送警備部處辦。</p>
<p>社局動員　澈查奸商</p>
<p>社會局以日來物貨暴漲，殊不合理，該局職司主管本市物價事宜，壓平物價責無旁貸，決動員物權管理課全體工作人員澈查。苟若發現奸商操縱物價，無論其身份及背景如何，決繩之以法，不稍寬貸。社會局長吳開先昨與記者談稱：本市米價，係受產地影響，而產地價高，則因被人採購大量北運之故。油價波動，亦因出口南運香港等地所致。本市配豆八千噸，用以搾油，原可自給自足，今因被人南運出國，換取外匯購奢侈品後再走私進口。本人爲此已面謁吳市長，請速設法予以制止。食油轉口，行政院原未加以限制，今因實際需要，故請吳市長呈請行政院禁止食油轉口。此兩漏洞如能予遏止，相信漲風即可抑平。而社會局已準備於必要時，隨時拋售食米。吳市長並要求糧食部撥給本市五萬噸食米，業蒙應允。</p>

<h3>管制下的日本（三）</h3>
<p>— 陳訓悆</p>
<p>軍事佔領與遣送戰俘（上）</p>
<p>自一九四五年九月二日在「米蘇里號」軍艦上簽訂受降書以後，麥帥即以盟軍最高司令官名義簽發第一號命令，飭各地日軍向下列各盟軍統帥投降：</p>
<p>（一）中國（除東北外）台灣及北緯十六度以北之越南所有日本軍隊，（包括一切陸上海上航空及補助部隊），應向中國統帥蔣委員長投降。</p>
<p>（二）中國東北，北緯卅八度以北之朝鮮庫頁島及千島羣島之日軍，應向蘇聯遠東最高司令官投降。</p>
<p>（三）安達曼羣島，尼科巴羣島，緬甸，暹羅，及北緯十六度以南之越南，馬來亞，蘇門答臘，爪哇，小巽達羣島，錫蘭，安班來，加依，阿爾，泰隆貝爾及阿拉甫勒羣島，與荷屬新幾內亞各島之日本軍隊，應向東南亞軍最高司令官投降。</p>
<p>（四）婆羅洲英屬新幾內亞，俾斯麥，及沙羅門界島之日本軍隊，應向澳洲陸軍最高司令官投降。</p>
<p>（五）日本委任統治各島，小笠原羣島，及其他太平洋各島之日本軍隊，應向美國太平洋艦隊最高司令官投降。</p>
<p>（六）日本國大本營及日本國本土與其陴接各小島北緯三十八度以南之朝鮮，琉球羣島，及菲律賓羣島之日本軍隊，應向美國太平洋陸軍部隊最高司令官投降。　以上各地區，合計約七百萬之日本軍隊。應完全解除武裝，艦船，兵器，彈藥，應照現狀保全移交上述各聯合國指揮官。</p>
<p>美國陸軍先遣部隊，係於一九四五年八月廿八日開始進駐日本，三十日麥克阿瑟元帥到達東京。美陸軍第八軍由艾克勃格中將指揮，旋即在東京成立司令部，分駐濱松以東至北海道一帶之主要地區克魯格中將所率之第六軍，則在京都成立司令部，分駐於濱松以西及九州之各要隘。此外，美遠東空軍由威德海中將率領，海軍由遠東艦隊司令格里芬中將（Vice　Admiral）率領，進駐各軍港，總兵力達四十萬人。當時陸海軍之駐在地區如下：</p>
<p>（一）第八軍所屬：（A）第十軍團駐橫濱；（B）第十四軍團駐仙台；（C）第九軍團駐江田島。</p>
<p>（二）第六軍所屬（A）第五水陸兩棲部隊駐佐世保；（B）第二海軍陸戰隊駐長崎；（C）第五海軍陸戰隊駐佐世保；（D）第一軍團駐大阪（E）第二十四軍團駐京都。</p>
<p>其後，麥帥於一九四六年一月三十一日發表與英國締結英軍進駐協定。英軍由白賴亭司令官率領，於二月開始進駐。自英軍進駐後，美佔領軍感於人數過多，特於四月間將第六軍全部調回。各佔領軍駐在地區，亦經一度予以調整。（參見下表）</p>
<p>自盟軍佔領日本後，其首要工作厥在摧毀日本作戰力之基礎，並集中全力於日軍復員工作。　日政府在盟軍最高司令官指導與監督之下，於一九四五年八月廿六日設置「終戰聯絡事務局，下設政治，經濟，設營及遣送四部，由常時外務省調查局局長岡崎勝男任局長職，主持其事。嗣由兒玉謙决繼任，稱爲總裁，改設六部：（一）總務，（二）政治，軍事，治安，文教，（三）財政，金融，（四）陸海空軍運輸，通訊，（五）軍隊整理，（六）留日外僑之遣送。此後，總裁一職，因兒玉列入放逐名單奉盟軍最高司令官令將其撤免，改由前外相吉田茂接充。此爲第三次改組，改組後僅分：政治，經濟，交通，設營，管理五部。又據日本行政區分設各地為戰聯絡事務局八所。</p>
<p>一九四五年十月十五日，解除日本武裝事宜，巳在盟軍總部指導下完成，當時麥克阿瑟元帥曾在向世界廣播演說中宜布日軍解體的詳情。八月廿三日撤廢日本最高戰爭指導會議，九月十三日撤廢日本海陸軍大本營；十月十五日撤廢日本海陸軍大本營參謀本部及軍令部；十一月卅日撒廢日本陸海軍省，至十二月一日正式成立第一復員省，及第二復員省，前者專司陸軍復員事宜；後者專司海軍復員事宜。一九四六年四月一日復員省亦予撤廢，改在內閣中設一復員應，廳長由前外相吉田茂兼任。復員應下設第一復員局（負陸軍復員工作之責。）及第二復員局（負海軍復員工作之責。）十月一日撒廢陸軍士官學校及其他類似的軍事學校。十月十”撤廢作戰部隊，如聯合艦隊司令部等組織。他如國民義勇隊（八月廿日），兵役法，（十月十七日）內閣情報局第一部專司陸海軍情報工作之機構與法令，亦均先後予以撤消。</p>
<p>麥克阿瑟統帥在廣播演講中又曾向全世界宣稱：日本國本土內日軍四百萬侵略武裝，悉已全部解除，計陸軍五十七個師團二百五十萬人，海軍一百二十萬人，其中包括海陸軍中之空軍二十萬人。</p>
<p>至此，明治元年一月十七日開始建軍巳屆七十七週年之日本軍部組織，宣吿全部解體。</p>
<h3>民主列車開動了（中）</h3>
<p>— 陳顧遠</p>
<p>各特有單位選舉之規定固係遵守憲法的指示，而憲法所以有這此規定主旨，無非爲保護在競選中的弱者而設。國民大會代表的選舉，由婦女團體選出者一百六十八名，各縣市如人口逾五十萬人者每增加五十萬人增選代表一人，在增加之代表中即有婦女代表一名；職業代表四百五十名中有婦女代表七十二名，加以其他各特項選舉中均有婦女代表名額之分配，合計佔百分之十。立法委員的選舉，無論爲某項選舉，十名以下者婦女一名，超過十名者每滿十名應有婦女當選名額一名，亦近於百分之十。監察委員的選舉，每省五名，須有婦女一名，其他選區或單位未再作硬性規定，雖然說不上是百分之二十，却也更爲接近。此外，婦女的候選人提名在立法委員方面僅須二百人簽署，與男子爲一與十五之比；在監察委員方面更不受簽署者人數之限制。同時婦女的票數旣係單獨計算，而如所規定之婦女名額，無婦女競選時，或當選後出缺無婦女候補人時，一律任其缺額，可認爲盡保護競選時弱者之能事。婦女界或希望一律暫以百分之二十爲起點，逐漸達到百分之五十，纔算公允，我却希望將來的選舉法規不再對婦女有特殊規定，纔算理想。因爲到了那時，婦女和男子同樣競選，且有把握，類此的規定，婦女界也不願再有了。</p>
<p>職業選舉在政治學上　有相當的理論，但係取區域選舉而代之，並非與區域選舉同時並存；且必屬於特殊的政治組織，不是現代的一般的民主國家所能採用的。憲法上旣列有職業代表，無論何人自應遵守，但其名額則授權法律定之。國民大會代表人數旣多，又非經常直接過問實際政治，爲應職業團體的要求，保持四百五十名的代表，約佔六分之一，倒也說得下去。惟立法委員的總名額旣不能過多，憲法所規定省及特別市選出者將近六百人，蒙藏僑民及土著民族選出者合計佔去五十七名，職業團體選出的立法委員不能增多，這固然是一個原因。同時，立法的事業應顧及全民的利益，職業方面的立法委員人數如高，很可能彩響立法的使命·譬如說，立法委員多數是資產階級的人，那節制資本扶助勞工的法律，就狠難通過了。何况現有職業團體的組織尙未普遍，而會員人數並有少至數百人者，區域選舉每百萬人總能出立法委員一名，職業團體的立法委員名額若多，也是極不公允的事。區域選舉並非失業集團的選舉，職業團體的會員正可憑其各種優秀條件，在區域方面活動，而將職業團體所出的名額，讓農工兩界多多佔有，方不失特設職業團體一個選舉單位的用意，它仍舊應該是爲保護競選中的弱者而如此的。</p>
<p>（三）要平等要目由並要公開</p>
<p>一般人孰無職業，却不必都加入職業團體，而加入職業團體的會員却都有其住居之區域是在。同時，一人而加人兩職業團體者有之，一人而於本籍之外另設寄籍者有之。爲了平等起見，無論國民大會代表或立法委員的選舉，就規定了每一選舉人只有一個選舉權，於各項選舉有二個以上選舉權者，限參加一抓，由選舉人於登記選舉人名冊時自行聲明，監察委員之由華僑團體選舉者，亦有此種限制。根據同一理由，有被選舉權人也不得爲二個以上候選人之登記，旣可使每個有被選舉權人在競選時取得平等的機會，並可免去兩處當選必須辭去其一的複繁手續。</p>
<p>候選人的提名，在歐美國家是由政黨介紹，或繳納一定之保證金而登記爲候選人，這是防止候選人過多，徒費造册時間並增加多少無意義的繁重程序。繳納保證金而登記爲候選人之例，在中國是行不通的，且旣爲自由競選，亦不應在金錢方面限制候選人的登記。國民大會代表及立法委員各該候選人的提名，除由一定數額的選舉人介紹外，便採用了政黨提名的辦法。雖然中國今日的政黨如雨後春筍，難計其數，果爲政黨與否亦不盡確，此門一開似乎過濫。然社會上公認的政黨究屬不多，一側集團倘眞具有政黨性，依民主國家的通例，即難限制其提出候選人。當茲開動民主的列車之際，創爲定規，實所必然，不能因噎廢食，付之缺如。政黨提名在中國目前僅作爲示範之舉，並非獨以政黨提名的辦法爲限，因而比例代表制即難實施；換言之比例代表制不能用於多數無黨無派的選民方而，中國今日正是如此情形。</p>
<p>政黨提名辦法，旣以樹立制度爲主要目的，那麼爲了切合實際上的需要，自不能不兼採選舉人簽署提名的辦法。由選舉人簽署爲候選人提名，在國民大會代表方面是要五百人以上的簽署，每選舉人以簽署一人爲限，對於各特別單位的選舉一律適用。在立法委員方面是要三千人以上的簽署，如為職業團體的候選人，則减爲五百名以上的簽署，如爲婦女候選人則减爲二百名以上的簽署；每選舉人皆以簽署候選人一人爲限。國民大會代表方面之簽署人數較少者，因代表的名額旣多，候選人自應加多；而縣市的選舉區又小，簽署人數若多，不啻剝奪競選者的權利。立法委員方面之簽署人數較多者，目然是由於立法委員的名額少選區大的一關係，而立法委員需要有才能的人常選，從簽署人數上爲候選人的限制也是一個理由。對職業國體候選人之簽署减爲五百名者係因職業團體人數較少，易於提出候選人而然。婦女候選人更减少其簽署人爲二百名者，以其非由婦女團體選出立法委員，係將婦女名額分配於各項選舉中，故特加以保護。</p>
<p>在監察委員方面，每一候選人的提出，各省市及蒙藏僅經選舉人五人以上的述署即可，這因爲省市議會或蒙藏地方議會，有時僅有議員十餘人，自不能將簽署人數提高。其在華僑團體選舉者，候選人的提出應經選舉人三十人以上的連署；其在蒙古地方議會成立以前由各聯合選舉區之各旗代表會，選舉時的候選人的提出，應經代表會以外依法有選舉區的　民三十人以上之連署；簽署人數仍不過高。婦女候選人的提出，其簽署人數更不受限制。在總統副總統方面，係由國民大會代表一百人以上於大會決定之期限內連署提出候選人，每一代表僅得提名或連署一决。所以須有一百人的連署，乃防止無聊的人僅以被提名爲總統副總統候選人即其目的所在，而自視爲榮，便不能不鄭重地加以限制。</p>
<p>現任官吏不得於其任所所在地之選舉區當選爲國民大會代表，這是憲法第二十八條第三項的規定，因事關重要在國民大會代表選舉罷免法第八條又作了注意的規定。立法委員選舉罷免法第十三條採其意規定爲現任文職或軍職之官吏於其管轄區以任所所在地之選舉區爲候選人者，應於選舉前五個月辭職，其規定的目的，不外乎排斥特殊勢力的操縱，俾人人有公開競選的機會。推而如選舉機關委員或監督及職員於其辦理選舉之區域或團體內不得爲國民大會代表或立法委員之候選人更係應然。監察委員的選舉，雖在其選舉罷免上沒有類似的規定，但辦理選舉的監督及職員應無候選人的資格實無疑義，將來在施行條例或有補充規定。但在監察委員選舉罷免法中却規定了每省市議會議員當選爲監察委員者以一名爲限，也是爲防止選舉人團有所操縱之故。而如此。</p>
<p>順便地在這裹說到選舉機關：原本想依過去成例在各種選舉事務所設選舉監督，後因各黨各派人士認爲辦理選舉機關宜容納各方參加，俾參加制憲的各黨派均有共同推進選政的機會。所以除蒙藏選舉事務所及監察委員選舉外，關於選舉事務所的組織，一律採用選舉委員會制。監察委員之選舉方而不用選舉委員會制者，因其程序較爲單純，且是罷免案通過後須另行補選，為補選一人而組織選舉委員會也覺過於繁難，故即以省市行政長官爲選舉監督。有人主張以議長爲其選舉監督，但如此，無形中剝奪議長的被選舉權，自不適宜。總統副總統的選舉由國民大會依法自行辦理，且係主席團制而非議長制，故不發生一切有關選舉機關的問題。</p>
<p>（四）如何當選？如何補缺？</p>
<p>無論爲國民大會代表或立法委員，都是依照法定名額，以得票比較多數者依次當選，票數相同時以抽籤定之。按照純粹的理論說，比較多數常選主義不無缺點：當選容易，所選出者未必即爲衆望所歸，這是一。當選旣不在最大多數，即不能鼓勵人民踴躍投票，這是二。候選人亦因之懶於爲大規模的競選活動，無以培養政黨在選舉中的實力，這是三。故有人主張候選人以得票超過投票總數之半數者爲常選，不足常選票數時再决投票，然後以比較多數爲當選。這一理想雖高，但在中國今日初行普選，大多數人民對於選舉尙缺乏習慣，如採絕對多數當選主義，任何選區或皆不免兩次之投票，耗復費時，種種不便，實非今日所宜。不特國民大會代表及立法秀員的當選採比較多數制，即監察委員的當選亦然。惟總統或副總統的當選，都係以得代表總額過半數之票數爲當選；如無人足此票數，則就得票比較多數之首三名重行投票，倘無結果，再作第三次投票：第一次仍無人足此票數，則以得票比較多數之首二名再來投票，才以得票較多者當選；票數相同者仍須投票而取決於比較多數。程序愼重，而亦繁難，自不能普行於其他各選舉中的當選方面。至於總統副總統的選舉應分別舉行，先選舉總統，再選舉副總統，無論爲絕對多數當選爲比較多數常選，彼此之間均不發生速繫關係。這兩種選舉所以分別舉行者爲了競選總統而落選的人，還可以有機會爲副總統的候選。</p>
<p>無論爲國民大會代表或立法委員如出缺時便由候補人依次遞補；候補人的產生係依法選足國民大會代表或立法委員名額後，其他得票之候選人本於票數多寡依次爲各該候選人，票數相同時以抽籤定之。有人認爲這種辦法不如補缺選舉之合理，並且與罷免制度並行時，不免誘發候補人運用罷免以求補缺的野心，時時乘隙而動，國家從此多事矣。然補缺選舉須正式辦理選舉；缺額時時有，選政亦時時在繼續中，對於中國現况終覺不宜。惟因其不採補缺選舉，故每選舉區或單位當選人在二名以下者；候補人名額定爲三名，當選人超過二名者候補人名額與常選人同，就是爲了預防候補人過少，而無候補人可補缺額時又須朮辦選舉的麻煩　候補人制度是不得而用之，所以監察委員出缺時就採了補缺選舉其繼任人之補選日期授權命令決定之，繼任監察委員任職至原任期屆滿之日爲止。總統缺位時或因罷免而解職時，由副總統繼任，至總統原任期屆滿之日爲止；因而副總統在實質上又不啻爲總統候補人。總統副總統均缺位時，依憲法第四十九條規定，除暫由行政院院長代行其職權外，並召集國民大會，臨時會，補選總統副總統，其任期以補足原任總統未滿之任期爲止，也可以說是一種補缺選舉。</p>
<p>（五）罷免權的愼用與濫用</p>
<p>罷免制度在中國爲創行，憲法上僅在第一百三十三條規定「被選舉人得由原選舉區依法罷免之」，如何在法律上爲有效的規定，頗費斟酌。旣不可因試行而將範圍縮小，予以限制，致人民空有罷免翩之名而無其實。又不可粗心地將尺度放寬，陷於濫用，致政治時常處於不安的狀態中，亦係失策。於是在四種選舉罷免法中對於罷免的規定，即不能不小心翼翼地下筆求全。</p>
<p>按照若干國家採用罷免制度的成例，對於就任未久者不得聲請罷免，這是防止罷免權的濫用。且在理論上，當選人的是否賢明，能否稱職，非經過相常期間實難判明；倘不定出相當期間的限制，今日選出，明日罷免，未免近於兒戲。况罷免是不需要法定理由的，雖在罷免聲請書上應叙述理由，這不過爲取得罷免投票人的同情，縱在客觀上無充分理由，只要罷免案通過後，一樣達到目的。那麼，爲了對於罷免聲請人一時的好惡，略加限制，更不能不如此了。國民大會代表選舉罷免法就規定原選舉單位之選舉人，對於所選之代表非經過六個月後，不得提出罷免聲請書。譬如說，本年九月前選出代表，十二月二十五日開會，那麼，代表常選後經過六個月是已執行過職務，自可因其成績不佳或其他情事予以罷免。但如無此限制，連會都未曾開過，選出後隨時罷免就難乎其爲代表了：立法委員選舉罷免法，監察委員選舉罷免法皆有同樣規定，予以六個月的期間以觀成效，總統副總統的罷免，對於政局影響更大，故國民大會代表對就任未滿十二個月之總統副總統不得聲請罷免。有人說，這雖免於罷免案的輕率提出，致影響總統副總統的威望，但如萬一總統副總統就任十二月內犯有內亂外患罪之重大嫌疑，倘不能罷免，又將如何穴洩民衆？須知總統副總統如有此種行爲，監察院自可提出彈劾，不受此一規定的限制。換言之，監察院對於總統副總統向國民大會提出彈劾案時，國民大會便可就總統副總統之罷免為決議，不受就任未滿十二個月的期間限制。</p>

<h3>一個百貨公司女店員的日記</h3>
<p>— 澧莉</p>
<p>我們的辦公地點以前是一個百貨公司，我的辦公抽屜中還遺留着許多發票簿，在發票簿中我發現了一本日記本，翻開來，字跡還秀麗。</p>
<p>三月三日</p>
<p>坐在櫃台中無聊，把五光十色燦爛耀目的小東西，一點一點拿出來玩，對着合上的圓鏡子，扣上胸針，戴上耳環，夾上髪夾，我很有點顧影自憐的感覺。又把一個個粉盒子打開來照照，主任先生走過來，我拿起一個我最喜歡的粉盒子對他說：</p>
<p>「送給我！」</p>
<p>「好，開一張發票好啦！」</p>
<p>他祗是說說，我若是開了發票，問誰去收錢去？</p>
<p>三月八日</p>
<p>下午彭說今天是婦女節，的我偸偸的溜出去，到對面去吃點心。吃完我們又約好，我先走，由旁門回來，彭去付賬，然後由正門回來，結果沒有人知道我們一同出去，</p>
<p>今天我覺得有點春天的意思了。</p>
<p>三月十一日</p>
<p>我在玩具部玩各式的玩具，彭走過來，我拿起一支木槍對準他的心，他嚇得發抖了；我想他是假裝的。</p>
<p>三月二十日</p>
<p>我到彭的櫃台中去買粉，出我的意外，彭說粉對於我不適宜</p>
<p>我說：「售貨員有什麼權力拒絕顧客？」</p>
<p>他說：「我是爲妳好，因爲妳內心很熱，粉會阻止妳皮膚的呼吸。」</p>
<p>「我的心很冷，」我說。</p>
<p>「不對，因爲妳臉上的雀斑證實了妳內心很熱。」</p>
<p>我非常氣憤。</p>
<p>三月二十一日</p>
<p>吃完中飯從樓上下來，看見麥伏在彭的櫃台少談笑。她有什麼理由和彭親密，她已是一個十歲女孩的母親，我輕輕走到她身邊，她嚇了一跳，很不好意思的回到她的襪子櫃台。</p>
<p>三月二十二日</p>
<p>彭要我請他吃糖。</p>
<p>我說：「不請，因爲我們之間沒有甜蜜。」</p>
<p>三月二十四日</p>
<p>麥到隔壁的伙食店裏買了一根生黃瓜，咬着吃，我覺得她太粗魯，但是彭却偏要愛她，我眞不懂，男人是什麼心理。</p>
<p>三月二十六日</p>
<p>午飯後，麥提議買花生糖吃，彭也贊成。</p>
<p>剛吃完飯又吃東西，不衛生，又花錢，我雖不贊成，也祗好服從多數，據說這就是「民主」</p>
<p>三月三十日</p>
<p>彭撫摸着麥的頭髮說：「麥小姐頭髮梳得眞好，前面高高的，兩旁向後一拉。」</p>
<p>我立刻走到鏡前一照，我的頭髮是一邊向下埀的，我覺得比麥的頭髮好看得多。</p>
<p>四月一日</p>
<p>今天是公司成立一週年紀念，大减價一星期。顧客的光臨是如潮湧，打鈴的聲音，鉛筆敲櫃台的聲音，雜亂一陣，一位同事急得用算盤拍着櫃合。——熟鬧極了！</p>
<p>四月三日</p>
<p>我們吃飯是分三班，我是吃第三班，時間是一點鐘。今天生意太好，打鈴的聲音太响，忙得沒有聽見飯鈴，一看已經一點二十分，我奇怪怎麼這樣晚還不開飯，一問第三班的飯已經開過，我非常着急，彭要請我吃飯，我不肯，因爲我知道他喜歡麥。結果主任先生請客，菜很好。</p>
<p>四月五日</p>
<p>我愛的粉盒子被顧客買去了。當我開那張發票時，我的心都痛了，不，我的心都碎了！開好設票，拿起粉盒子作最後一次的注視。</p>
<p>「多麼好看的粉盒子！」我說着。</p>
<p>顧客發出得意的微笑。</p>
<p>四月七日</p>
<p>一位顧客要買白色的轆輾綫，我在櫃台中尋了一回，尋不着，我吿訴她白色的賣完了，她覺得很失望，我於是拿了一軸淺藍色的問她；「這個可以嗎？」她拿了看看，不大一喜歡，她自己向櫃台中尋找了一回，指着一軸呌我拿出來，我一看那也是淺監色的，並且很不好拿，我就說：「那是淺藍色的」，一妳拿出來看看」！「拿出來也是藍色」，她一定要我拿，我祇好服從顧客的意思，把所有的綫軸都搬出來，然後把她所指的那軸拿了出來給她，她接過來一看，笑了一笑又還給我，我當時氣憤到極點。</p>
<p>四月八日</p>
<p>今天是麥的生日，晚上她請我們吃麵。</p>
<p>下班以後，麥坐在彭的自由軍後面先回去，我和趙先生劉先生乘電車去。地點是麥選定的，我們不大熟悉，費了很多時間纔找着，原來是一個又髒又小的麪店，說出來眞難爲情。</p>
<p>一進去就望見蒙着鮮艷頭中的麥和彭對坐着吃麪，我還有什麼話說。</p>
<p>四月九日</p>
<p>我接到一張通知單，那是我開錯了發票，應該賠償一萬餘元。</p>
<p>公司生意好，對於我有什麼好處，壞處倒是有的。以後還是少做一點生意吧！一種東西還分許多貨號，許多價目，顧客們的挑選又是來勢汹汹，呌我怎麼弄得淸。</p>
<p>聽說龍華桃花已謝，今年的春天算是完了！</p>
<p>下班彭又約麥坐在的自由車後面送她回去。哼，他們還在我面前假裝正經呢！……</p>

<h3>巴蕾答額問</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>英國戲劇界，元老巴蕾（James　Metlew　Barrie　1860），是一個很詼諧的人。有一次，有許多人去訪問他，問到關於他作品成功的過程時，他有趣地回答說：新聞記者是兩袋烟等於一小時，二小時等於一個思想，一個思想等於三段新聞，三段新聞等於一個領袖。但小說家却是八袋烟等於一英兩，七英兩等於一星期，兩星期等於一章，二十章等於一個筆尖，兩個筆尖等於一部小說。大文豪高爾斯華綏有一次演講自己的寫作經騐時，也引用了這幾句話。</p>
<h3>四月</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>四月——</p>
<p>枝繁葉茂城市的樹</p>
<p>開滿霓虹燈的花。</p>
<p>這大樹</p>
<p>將根植在黃浦江上</p>
<p>雙生的樹幹</p>
<p>（南京路和林森路</p>
<p>多花的枝條…）</p>
<p>遊蜂浪蝶歡狂了</p>
<p>霓虹燈是他們的驕傲。</p>
<p>然而</p>
<p>貧乏的都市將更貧乏</p>
<p>乾枯的樹枝和生滿</p>
<p>霓虹燈的樹枝對比之下</p>
<p>城市的面孔</p>
<p>更加顯得蒼白。</p>
<p>看護　監蕙</p>
<p>從膿汚的　血挨鄰出來，</p>
<p>仍然是一身潔白。</p>
<p>讓病人們畫一個感激的十字吧，</p>
<p>紅紅地嵌在你胸口上。</p>
<p>做一個大衆的母親，</p>
<p>你的孩子們是不論年紀的；</p>
<p>八十歲的病人，</p>
<p>一樣需要你安慰的乳汁呵！</p>
<p>無名的醫生，</p>
<p>用溫柔和疾病爭鬥的戰士；</p>
<p>你時時親近着死，</p>
<p>却日夜保護人們向生，</p>
<p>晨花　呂莊</p>
<p>昨宵，揚着緋色帆影</p>
<p>總晨風而傾發</p>
<p>今朝，來到世間尙未見過陽光</p>
<p>却落在賣花女的竹籃中</p>
<p>影子　郊奔</p>
<p>清晰的時候，</p>
<p>像眼前的火；</p>
<p>糢糊的時候，</p>
<p>像夢裏的烟；</p>
<p>十年長征呵，</p>
<p>壓上了多少悲哀</p>
<p>多少塵灰！</p>
<h3>窗及其他</h3>
<p>— 張勉之</p>
<p>窗</p>
<p>流寓在這郊區小村鎭的盡頭，屈指又已半年了。佔屋雖祗一間，半臥室，半客座，總算一個家。爲减少過往吃食祖給與孩子的誘惑，每天總把前門緊緊拴上，屋子也要深邃些。反心這裏熟人極少，也難得有遠客來。所好還有一口明淨的玻窗，吾者我將更沉悶更窒息，它是我的眼目，我的光明的灌溉者。</p>
<p>今天，孩子們午睡未醒，屋子裏異樣沉寂。它却陣陣顫抖，時時發出格格的聲音來。</p>
<p>刮風了，還含着些沙，原野和天際迷濛着一片混濁的土黃色，雲也是那麼灰黃，漫無邊際的。前面連綿着丘陵起伏的土饅頭，看不見草色，半遮着的叉枒樹枝，中間雖夾幾棵低矮的長綠樹，點綴在露出的幾家村莊老屋的角落，也顯得幽暗而糢糊，再後面那座新蓋稻草的三角形藏冰房，宛然金字塔般矗峙在風沙中。</p>
<p>我木呆地站在窗邊，有意無意地望着這些景色，慢慢注視到樹枒裏有隱的搖曳的風箏影兒，她是多麼瀟洒出塵，可望而不可即，她織成了我底故鄉原野的夢；</p>
<p>麥浪已經翻風，其間還發出雉　的求侶聲。罐豆也擠着媚眼，蝴蝶似的眼，野孩們借着挑齊菜的名目，逃避了大人們的督責，追逐在田野中，有的躺在那裹，躺在風輪聲中，麥睡早已用鋤牙　剔過了，刮風天，大人們大抵躱在屋子裏，希望二月八雨汎，麥田才得滋潤，還有麵長魚吃，不聽嗎，風聲虎虎，掩着門的人家，布機聲吱呀吱呀竄過留檔。那些熟悉的臉容，一張張浮現眼前，我的兩個失去了母親的孩子，正讀着村塾，該有些凉了，多帶了衣裳沒有？……</p>
<p>一陣凄酸，遠遠仍然是連綿起伏的土饅頭，我又想故鄕那裏已少有一張開朗的笑臉，也少有一餐整齊的饌食，他們都穿着破爛的衣裳，晚上點着豆油燈，常常槍響，難得聽見狗呌，故鄕巳瘦得只賸一副骨頭，成千成萬的人流亡到異地，那是個甚麼世界呀。</p>
<p>我不忍再想，大道上已無菜販們的踪影了，偶然有賣甘蔗或學嘴的担兒，肩上蓋滿風沙，瞞跚地走回他們的臨時寓所。</p>
<p>今天日腳異樣長，一分一刻都很沉重。</p>
<p>風愈刮愈緊，我底窗口也愈呌愈響。一陣機聲掠過，我重重地把玻窗打開，讓風吹進來，吹我發燙的臉頰，雖然塵沙封住我窗沿下的桌子。</p>
<p>報</p>
<p>是一個浪跡天涯，無以營生的人了，肩負着連喝乳嬰孩四口子的負祖。我不知道以前怎樣渡過許多日子，更茫然怎樣打發將來的許多日子。</p>
<p>綠衣人也顯得冷淡，漠然紙過，並不進來，送報人却做了我唯一的門客，每夭等待着他，如一顆投石激動平淡的淺流。它帶給我溫情和淚水，激勵我也深深地磨折我。見了面猶如家人晤對作親切的心語，一天離開，就無所歸依，天哪，它竟這樣地糾纏我，抓住了我靈魂，再也不肯放鬆我。</p>
<p>最難忘的是雨夜孕育着恬靜我獨自輕輕就燈前虔敬地翻開堆蓄着的日報，逐頁逐頁剪下喜讀的文字和木刻，無異乎風雨故人來的那一種衷心的喜悅。當然，內戰的殺聲，物價的直錢上昇，無日不苦惱着我，但惟其緊張之強烈且久，稍得鬆弛，也就分外矜貴了。</p>
<p>質</p>
<p>小時候讀「朝回日日典春衣」等詩句時以爲典質一事，似乎有些雅趣存乎其間的。</p>
<p>當我懷着怯頹的心情和朝奉們討價還價時，又覺得完全不是讀詩時的那麼一回事了。</p>
<p>幾回看見短打英雄們，冷天，脫下身穿的棉襖或毛絨衫之類，他們的神情多麼坦然，多麼洒脫，感覺我那種顫巍巍的樣子，簡直是十足的頭中氣了，要不得，要不得。！</p>
<p>近來計算幣値，高利貸可說已不復存在，可是經過幾番限滿加利時的奔波，看見衙門似的典舖，實在有些敬而遠之，有時甚至佯作不見，連忙盯住其他店餽或車輛，以减少那稱無聲的威脅。不過轉念着有辦法親友們的臉色，未必比朝奉們和悅，倒又有些眷念之思了。</p>
<h3>哭翁銅士有序</h3>
<p>— 王翰仙</p>
<p>與翁山翁都門別後，瞬及十年；前歲自蜀東歸，在滬探詢，迄無知者。旋翀　兄吿我住永嘉路和邨，急驅車往訪，値翁他出；乃翌日即來視余，且述近狀，謂腕力未衰，書法益進，願對衆揮毫，以暢積愫，余亦擬邀宴而未果也。復以事冗極少過從，而山翁疾歿之耗驟至，震悼之餘，哭之以詩。</p>
<p>東歸苦憶老山翁，但識申江作寓公；幾度和邨邨畔路，故人却在此邨中</p>
<p>喜來舊雨從今雨，相見悲歡隔世同；太息而今眞隔世，修文赴召忒匆匆</p>
<p>勞燕西飛今又還，不堪桑海十年間；舊遊零落知多少？一老憗遺造物慳</p>
<p>自說揮毫力未痛，欲共知好一淸娛；如何此的終虛負，斷楮零縑問有無</p>
<p>情兼師友輙隨肩，契合苔岑詎偶然？史局追陪辰夕共，狂　捲霧廿餘年</p>
<h3>婚後的情書</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>你接受我的邀請，我們一同看戲，其實我們自身也正在扮演一幕劇——這個劇本的內容，你或許不甚明瞭，但是，我却了解它的始終。</p>
<p>以下就是全部眞相：</p>
<p>我們初次見面的那一個夏天，那時我還是一個無拘束的男孩，我對你發生了好感，不過，那時你別有知己友人，我祗有暗中用淚水來消滅心裏的熱情。……。後來，我也和一位小姐認識，互相了解，訂了婚的，可是，我還忘不了你，最近，方才知道你和那一位朋友並無特殊的友誼，因此，每當夜深人寂，我常起遐想：我此刻還有資格向你表示心中的情愫嗎？</p>
<p>你現在已經明白全部經過，我的說話，坦白無所畏忌，我相信能將性格和感情支配行爲的人類，方才懂得人生的快樂。</p>
<p>感情是可愛，也是可怕的，它決不是罪惡，更無法約東，不過，我決定把這一個不可能的愛情，改為對你的尊敬。因爲：丈夫的愛情，應該全部屬於他的妻子的。</p>
<p>再會！祝你快樂。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉風</p>
<p>民國十七年間，國軍北伐成功，上海西南郊，就有着這們一個團體，地點本來是一個大家族的祠堂，後來他們自己人改稱「百忍莊」。</p>
<p>這個小集團，到眼面前爲止，一共才有二十位左右的幾個人。據說這集團的領袖人物，是一位六十幾歲的老人，全團稱他爲「覺厂老人」。上海這個百忍莊，僅是一個徵集人才的臨時駐足的所在。原來的發祥地，還在浙皖交界，西天目餘脈的一個天然世外桃源裏。那是一個大谷，四面有絕嶺險崖的屛障，題名呌「大　谷」。</p>
<p>這位沒錢厂老人，歷盡宦途的險　，人海的滄桑，却又不甘自暴自棄；於是揀定了這個深山大谷，實施他的「烏托邦理想』。他說中國是個農國，最理想的岡强方式，莫如新村教育。他知道同時代同一理想的人，也不在少數，除了大部分有心無力之外，實行這理想的人，也着實有幾個。回奈這些人中，有的計劃不徹底，只呌人家脫了赤脚下田，呌螞蟥去釘，自己却穿了熨成四條綫輪廓的西裝長褲，在一旁拍美術照，預備作募捐的廣吿。還　些不三不四的什麼之類的課本，說是農村教育。</p>
<p>他又知道，有的人神通廣大，居然有本事募了中外偌大一個數目的捐款，弄些三四路的鍍金博士碩士學士，說是農林專家，把募來的巨款，花在改良猪改良鷄上，自己却拿那些改良名義的外國鷄鴨，薰了炙了來當英法大菜吃。</p>
<p>覺厂老人，却不是這等辨法。他首先在大覺谷裏，開闢一個實騐新村，算是一個單位。在這單位裏，他招集了幾位埋沒了的農林實用人才，儘量採用適合我國土壤人情的西法，耕植畜牧。又遣送一些可培植的少年，到各外國去實地學習實用科目，回來襄助發展。</p>
<p>關於教育一項，不僅僅在認識幾個基本字上；他們採用國外最新式的教育利器；電影，無綫電收音器，幻燈，小組講演，戲劇，音樂，等等，等等，讓這新村裏的人，吸收各種新知識。</p>
<p>這新村裏，只有一個教條：效忠國家，盡一切國民當盡的義務？愛護人類，謀人類一切應謀的幸福。</p>
<p>村中除了發展知識和道德外，覺厂老人尤其着重人人體質的健康。普通的體育運動，新式的，他們有各種體操，球戲，競賽，游泳；舊式的，却是特別；因為覺厂老人自己，就精通養生術，內外功，和各門技擊。所以全村的人，最低限度，也練過您家祖傳的秘本八段錦和易筋經。至於一般體質適合，性情習近的，則按各人的本質，鍜鍊着內外功拳術，和專門本領，類如擒拿手，達摩掌，蝦蟆功，一指禪，等等。還有幾位特別精進的，竟能運用「太極禪功空勁」。……</p>
<p>「你說得太美了些吧」！　見聽了正岩這段報告，心下覺得奇獲，極端興奮，卻好像聽了一個神話故事似的，有些不敢相信。</p>
<p>「不，隊長；部下不敢造一個字謠言；只恨說得不眞切……」</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>一個碼頭工人，白天勞果不堪；晚上想安安穩穩地睡一覺，可是在夢裏他仍是操着笨重的工作，第二天仍是勞累不堪。</p>
<p>吃了幾十年長素的人，如果有一天突然想開　而大啖其豬肉。這便是證明此人不久人世了。</p>
<p>人們原是正常地循着生活習慣的軌道去覓得每一個平靜安穩的明天。生命的彈性絕不能容忍理想與實踐後同一個時候崩潰。</p>
<p>是以，我認爲和尙或尼姑的突然結婚，比紈袴子弟的縱慾更爲可怕。</p>
<p>人類悄感上的懲結（Complex）如找不到通當的昇華，而只是勉强地鬱壓；道後果是不可想象的。</p>
<p>矯飾偉大以原恕他人，其本身的罪東，必爲不可赦免。</p>
<p>而被視爲洪水猛獸底偉大的靈魂；由於先知，故必受難，——這是無法避免的定律。他們釘在十字架上，忘記了羣小的誣譏與自身的流血，却抱着一腔的悲憫；向人類呼喚着永生之道，看自私的汪洋淹減了多少靈曉的小舟，</p>
<p>這偉大的　禍，不是一種「表情」，也不是一種「姿態」，而是「眞」，是「着」，是「美」，是舉世　酒中的一個小　。</p>
<p>原恕敵人比加惠朋友更需有寬大的樣　了。</p>
<p>何况，基督所要求我們的是拯救敵人！</p>
<p>「以怨報德」眞是一件極不易的行爲。</p>
<p>藥石是救治病人的，如果將配尼西靈注射入死人的臂膀上，是大可不必的。有些人喜歡送死人到殯儀館去梳粧打扮，這種「死要臉」的惡作劇；遠不如燒些元寳到陰間去，來得有趣。如果剖開死人的胸膛，納進魚翅燕窩，死人雖不嘔吐，生人何忍？蓋沽名之法正多着也。</p>
<p>正因爲藥石不能妄投死人以求愈。同理「以怨報德」自有其相當的限度；我不敢想象某些吾國人所謂的美德。故敢爲此一論。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>上海人的荷包</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>半個月來上海人的遊春，可謂到了如痴如在的程度。龍華的遊人如　，北火車站擁擠得婦孺死傷日有所聞，上海人的荷包裏有的是錢，這是一個事實的證明。這些有錢的上海人到了鄉下，他們那種揮金如土的豪情勝槪，眞有些兒像太平洋戰爭剛結束時紛紛從上海來到此地的美國水手們，那種氣派彷彿是在說，祗要你們暍價，我們總買得起；你們「一切的一切」都是可以用錢購買的，我們也能够用錢購買你們「一切的一切！」這引號裏的五個大字，雖然是刺耳的爛調，却足以描摹出上海人擺在鄕下人面前氣吞山河的吃相。</p>
<p>外國記者曾經說我們「全國饑餓，上海跳舞」。看到半個月來上海人遊春的佳興，以及內地同胞們生活的貧苦，可知這句話實在沒有說錯。可是話得說回來，所謂全國也者，不論從文字上或從實情上說，跳舞的上海也在其內。上海近四百萬的人口之中，就有半數以上的人們在饑餓綫上挨着日子。所以我們倘然把那外國記者的話改爲「上海饑餓，上海跳舞，」也不會說錯。</p>
<p>我的意思不但是說上海有些人密饑餓，有些人在跳舞，而且是說同一個饑餓的人，他在跳舞，同一個跳舞的人，他的肚子裏也在饑餓着。所以再把上面的話改爲「上海人饑餓，上海人跳舞，」也不能算錯。上海人遊春落鄕時的荷包是裝得滿滿的，然而你可知道他們的錢是從那裏來的？有不少人是遊一决春，準備一個月不天亮了。可是明知下個月天不亮，遊春這個熟鬧還不能不參加。這便是上海人「今日有酒今日醉」的人生觀。他們的享受，就建築在饑餓綫上。鄕下人看上海人衣飾華麗，舉止闊綽，以爲他們平日一定吃的山珍海味、住的高樓大厦，殊不知他們往往住在擱樓裏面，吃着鹹泡飯，朝不保夕的，反過來看看鄕下人，似乎是處處寒酸，其實他們倒是穩紮穩打，在自己所有的三間茅屋裏面，布衣菜根，不用天天着急，日日發愁。</p>
<p>上海宛如厄普頓辛克萊的小說裘所描寫的一個工廠。工人們日夜勞作所得的一點工資，都消耗在工廠附設的酒排間和賭塲裏面。你看他們在這些娛樂塲所，放蕩得多麼快樂，你却不知道他們其實快樂得多麼可憐。</p>
<h3>向敎部請願</h3>
<p>— 錢永發</p>
<p>四月一日，教育部修正的三條專科以上學校的學籍規則第二條是：「職業與師範學校的畢業生，均須服務四年，始准升學。」我們職校的學生看了，眞有哭笑不得之槪。</p>
<p>四年之時間不算短，敎育部尤其說四年以後始准升學，還是爽快的說職校畢業的同學不准升學的好。要是我們僥倖的找到了職業，並且服務了四年，我們　中的一些幾何，代數，早就忘之一空了。如果教育部說：「在服務的四年中，你們可以努力溫習」，那末教部能否再肯定的說一句：「在你們服務的過程中，一定有相當的空閒時間，可供你們溫習入學考試的科目。」</p>
<p>教育部沒有說明職業和師範學校不能立刻升學的理由，我想，師校學生大槪受了教部免費的「恩惠。」但我們職校學生却並沒有受到那種「恩惠」啊，我們也是和其他的學校一樣，每學期繳了一大疊，一大疊的學費。教部要是說：「你們入職校的目的是求業，何必又要升學呢？道話本來不錯，但教育部能不能担保，在目前不景氣的社會中，我們中等學歷的學生必能找到職業無疑？萬一找不到職業，教部又不准我們升學，難道呌我們眞的寄生在家裏嗎？</p>
<p>教部的規定，實在沒有理由，我們職校的學生旣不低能，亦不笨拙，我們非但要應付校中的專門課程，而升學時照樣也要應付校中教不到的普通科目。所以我們請求教育部，廢止這一條不合理的規定，否則我們職校學生的前途是堪慮的。</p>
<h3>開倒車</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>國定本教科書之印行，據聞尙無確切辦法，各書店爲防止物價工價再漲，成本恐再加重，據悉多已紛紛印製戰前舊審定本，以便作秋銷書的供應。這種書是否適合於現時代的需要，眞是一個疑問，教科書開倒車，的確是一種不合理的壞現象。（編者按：此訊未知確實否，望各書局給我們一個答覆。）</p>
<h3>讀「無梯樓雜筆」</h3>
<p>— 飛塵</p>
<p>這是一本經過搥鍊而又充滿戰鬥意味的報吿文學。在燈下，我承受了作者豐滿奔放的感情，幾乎不能自己！</p>
<p>收在這集子裏的，一共是卅五篇，都是作者卜少夫先生在抗戰八年期中，先後在大後方留下來的感情的綴拾。正因爲卜少夫先生是一位獻身新聞工作廿餘年的戰士，因之，經過了感情的搥鍊，抗戰之火的陶冶，而再吐納出來的華篇，它都閃爍着感情的火花，炫耀着作者無邊的才華。</p>
<p>當我靜靜地讀着他在重慶，在貴陽，在昆明，在柳州，在甫寗所記述的文裏邊，我好像聽到了他的風濤之聲，我好像也看到了那淸澈潺潺的長流。在記叙重慶時「轟炸」裏，作者寫着：</p>
<p>「……炸彈落到地面後，冲起一陣烟燄，一派火花，隨後又慢慢的消逝了。……揚子嘉陵兩江的江水潺潺地流，靑綠的花木，搖曳着夏之色香味，我的感情浸沉在這種黏性的韌性的，强勁耐力的百節蟲之執拗的氣氛裏。</p>
<p>這短短的片斷裏，已為我們畫下抗戰八年「戰鬥重慶」怎樣堅强地站在轟炸烟燈的前哨。</p>
<p>「病院行走」「一　萬金」寫出了一個新聞工作者在抗戰期中生活的艱苦與難熬；寫人物有「憶英茵」「憶魯少飛」「四大名將」；論戲劇·圖畫，有「杏花春雨江南」「蛻變」與「安魂曲」；「沈鐵如畫展」等。</p>
<p>卅五篇中，有詩史式的報吿文學，有雜感，有小品，有讀書扎記，有人物訪問……。它包含得那樣開闊而多樣性，它在明麗淸　之中，而又現出它的豪放與奔流。</p>
<p>這是四月新春中，一部値得推荐的佳作。</p>

<h3>論科舉付佳話</h3>
<p>— 慕陶</p>
<p>兪曲園先生，自河南學政罷官後，在春在堂中，度其優游著舊之歲月，故曾文正曾語先君曰：吾有兩門生，一爲李少荃，拚命倣官，一爲兪曲園，拚命著書，所謂春在堂者，乃庚戌朝考時，試帖詩題，乃係淡雲疎雨落花天，文正賞其首句，爲花落春常在，拔置第一，（即朝元）故曲翁即以春在名堂。此與袁隨　之人似隔天河一語，爲尹文端所賞，同爲科舉佳話。然隨園得子遲，曲園得孫早，階靑太史，以注元補博士弟子員，己卯鄉舉高魁，廷試探花及第，實爲曲翁晚年最得意之事。故自製一聯曰：「老夫旣耄，藏書數萬卷，　齊數千卷，著書數百卷；小子何知，院試第一人，鄉試第二人，殿試第三人。」下聯同爲科名佳話，上聯則非曲園無此身分，亦無此口吻也，余謂廢科舉之得失，又雷別論，然實不免煞風景，蓋科舉時代之遺文逸事，傳諸人口者，實多風趣，即如阮文達府試時，交卷後，偶折庭中杏花一枝，爲府尊所見，出一對曰：「小小書生，袖底暗藏春色。」文達即應聲對曰：「堂堂太守，目中明察秋毫。」可謂工極。又文達爲浙江學政時，曾充鄕試監臨，曾製一聯曰：「下筆千言，正槐子黃時，桂花香囊，出門一笑，看西湖月滿，東浙潮來。」興會　舉，氣象闊大，亦一科場佳話也</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 春瘦鷗</p>
<p>伙近十年的出賣　　的生活還沒有磨凈金愛麗的忠厚的天性，聽老祝這麼赤裸裸地一說，臉上便顯得怪不好意思地。</p>
<p>老祝很注意地看了她一眼。</p>
<p>「愛麗，你是個好人！可惜你少念了幾年書。」</p>
<p>「你又不肯教我！」又像怨恨，又像感激的答覆。</p>
<p>她也把面前的一杯豆漿喝完了。顯然，她對老祝所說的話認爲很有理，覺得自己的問題已解決了，心裏不由鬆了許多。</p>
<p>「假使你不生氣的話，現在我就把五百元美金一起給你。」她的手輕輕地覆在老祝的手上，傳達了一種無言的情感。</p>
<p>老祝倒並不生氣，祗忍不住要笑。</p>
<p>「愛麗，我不會對你生氣的。可是，我並不需要錢！我也有錢！」他橡哄一個孩子似的說。</p>
<p>「你也有錢？」金愛麗有一些詫異，但並不十分詫異。因爲老祝這個人，對她實在是一個謎，平時並不見他做什麼生意，或勾結什麼官塲中人，可是也從未見他有衣衫襤褸，或向人借錢的時候；甚至有幾次，她的確知道小沈還向老祝借過錢。所以，老祝的生活究竟怎樣，經濟情形究竟怎樣，她簡直糢糊得很。</p>
<p>老祝又向她點了點頭，表示自己確實有錢。</p>
<p>「那末你爲什麼不走呢？」女的忍不住又追問了一句。</p>
<p>男的知道跟她解說，她也不會明瞭，便含混地說：</p>
<p>「許多朋友在一起，不好意思先走。」</p>
<p>「你是有良心的，我知道！」金愛麗很有一些感慨。</p>
<p>老祝覺得無話可談了，便繼續張口大吃，一面又勸金愛麗也多吃一些。</p>
<p>「你哪好朋友胡太太聽說也還沒有走，你不替她想想辦法嗎？」金愛麗倒吃不下去，心裏有許多話想說，第一就提到　。</p>
<p>「老朋友，不是好朋友。愛麗，別那麼說！朋友都是一樣的。」老祝苦笑了一下。「她們倒很想走，可是弄不到車子，也是無法。今天晚上，也許她們再要上火車站去試試，只是一位太太帶着兩個孩子，也未必能上得去。」</p>
<p>「你不是很有辦法嗎？」金愛麗挑上一句。</p>
<p>老祝給她這麼一問，倒湧起了滿腔的牢騷。（三八）</p>

<h3>National Army Intensifies Suppression in Shaanxi and Gansu, Anbian and Qingyang Reclaimed Successively, Battles Along the Tongpu Railway Becoming Increasingly Fierce</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] Shaanxi Northern Battle Reports: (1) The National Army advancing north along the Yellow River cut off Wubao on the 7th. The communist route into Shanxi from Suide was blocked. The battle for Suide City continued on the 7th. The National Army broke into the city several times, and the seesaw battle was fierce. (2) The National Army that captured Bao'an continued north, heading directly for Jingbian. The vanguard had crossed the Xunjiansi mountains. Another unit annihilated more than 500 communist troops northeast of Bao'an on the morning of the 7th. The Ma Hongbin unit advancing eastward fought fiercely with the communist army in Shikou Village, two li south of Anbian Fort on the 7th, and Anbian could be captured soon. The communist forces in Jingbian and Hengshan are retreating eastward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia Urgent Telegram, 8th] The National Army attacking Anbian began to attack the city at 5:00 AM on the 8th. After nine hours of fierce fighting, Anbian Fort was completely recovered at 2:00 PM. The communist army retreated in defeat towards Jingbian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia Dispatch, 8th] The National Army advancing east from Dingbian attacked Zhuanjing, 40 li west of Anbian, on the morning of the 7th. After a day of fierce fighting, the communist army suffered more than 200 casualties and collapsed in defeat. The National Army then recovered Zhuanjing at 9:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch, 8th] The remnants of the communist army entrenched in Suide and Mizhi in northern Shaanxi will soon be finally eliminated within one or two days. The National Army advancing north along the Xianyu Road has joined forces with the National Army from the Wabu area and has crossed the narrow passes and steep mountains along the way. It is reported that the vanguard troops have now reached the vicinity of Tianzhuang in the southern part of Suide. At the same time, the National Army from Yulin is advancing towards Mizhi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia Dispatch, 8th] The National Army that recovered Dingbian continued to advance east and arrived at the suburbs of Anbian Fort on the 7th. Anbian can be captured soon. When this National Army recovered Dingbian on the 4th, it achieved brilliant results, including killing communist guerrilla commander Guo Baoshan, two battalion commanders, capturing alive Wang Dunchuan, commander of the 8th Police Regiment, Gao Yuanshan, deputy commander of the 11th Brigade, more than 2,000 officers and soldiers who surrendered, killing more than 200 horses, and seizing 13 mortars, 39 light and heavy machine guns, more than 1,000 long and short guns, a generator, more than 50 horses, and a large number of clothing and other items.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch, 8th] The National Army recovered Qingyang County in northeastern Gansu Province at 8:00 AM on the 8th. This place was the base of the communist army in the Shaanxi-Gansu border area. Now the remaining communist forces are fleeing northeast, and the National Army is pursuing them.</p>
<p>[Our Yan'an Dispatch, 7th] The remnants of the communist army under Wang Zhen, eight regiments totaling 20,000 men, were entrenched in Cuitou Village, 40 li south of Wabu. Since 1:00 PM on the 6th, after the National Army encircled and suppressed them from three sides and fought fiercely all night, more than 1,000 communist troops were annihilated by 4:00 AM on the 7th. The seized war spoils are being inventoried. The remaining communist forces are collapsing westward.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 7th] The communist army has burned down the Yingpan south of Suide City. Mizhi is also under the pressure of the National Army moving south. The communist army in northern Shaanxi is on the verge of collapse. A large number of staff members and their families are also continuing to cross the river from eastern Shaanxi to Qikou. Observers believe that after the disastrous defeat of the CCP in northern Shaanxi, it will concentrate more than 200,000 troops from Shanxi and Shaanxi and mobilize communist forces from Hebei and Henan to launch a desperate and risky attack on Taiyuan. The recent southward movement from northern Shanxi and the extensive attacks launched in southern Shanxi to force the situation in the north are symbolic of this. The battlefield in southern Shanxi is expanding, and it is particularly fierce along the Tongpu Road. Starting on the evening of the 4th, the communist army attacked Houma from Jiangxian and occupied it by the morning of the 6th. Quwo County is also surrounded, and Yixian is still in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] After the communist army's Chen Ji unit of five brigades launched a general attack on the counties in southern Shanxi, Houma on the Tongpu Line was captured on the morning of the 7th. Yixian, Quwo, Jiangxian, Xinjiang and other counties are still under fierce attack. In addition, more than 1,000 troops of Wang Yong's unit once invaded the airport from Shuitou, southwest of Wenxi. Three regiments of communist troops who sneaked into the eastern part of Xiaxian have attempted to attack Anyi and Yuncheng. A part of the communist army also sneaked into the vicinity of Fencheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch, 8th] The two counties of Xinjiang and Fushan in southern Shanxi were occupied by communist troops on the 7th.</p>
<p>[Our Guihua Dispatch, 7th] The communist army's Kang Jianmin Brigade has lost contact with Kelan Mountain and sneaked into the area south of Zhuozishan Station on the Ping-Sui Railway on the 7th and was encircled and suppressed by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Lu National Army Divides into Three Routes, Advancing Towards the Yimeng Mountain Area, Jiaoji Line Recovers Tanjiafangzi Station</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The National Army in central and southern Shandong is currently advancing towards the Yimeng Mountain area from the southwest in three routes. The National Army advancing from Dawenkou towards Xintai recovered Loude Town, 45 kilometers west of Xintai, at noon on the 7th. The National Army advancing east from Sishui recovered Guanshan Tou, nine kilometers northeast of Bianchang, and Siding Mountain, four kilometers away, in the afternoon of the 7th, defeating more than 2,000 communist troops and capturing more than 50. This National Army is now only 25 kilometers away from Mengyin. The National Army in Feixian continued to advance towards Shangye, south of Mengyin, on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The National Army, which continues to sweep the mountainous areas in southern Shandong on the east side of the Jinpu Line, surrounded more than 3,000 communist troops in the area north of Fushan, 20 kilometers east of Tengxian, and south of Zhaoshuling on the 7th, and is now annihilating them. Another National Army recovered Zhengcheng, 12 kilometers northwest of Liangqiu, on the 7th, and seized a small communist arsenal and more than 20 trucks.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 8th] The communist army on the Jiaoji Line continues to retreat towards the mountainous areas in southern Shandong. The more than 10,000 New Fourth Army troops and police regiments who were originally based in Yidu Chengguan and Zhangmenkou Lanliushu, and the police regiment at Yangzhuang Station, all sneaked into Linqu on the 7th. There are no main communist forces near Yidu, and the National Army has recovered Tanjiafangzi Station.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, 8th] The highway between Jinan and Tai'an has been repaired and is open to traffic. The highway from Tai'an to Jining is also under construction.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] More than 3,000 remnants of the communist army's Jin Shaoshan unit in eastern Henan sneaked into Xunmukou, four kilometers southwest of Taikang, on the 7th. The National Army is pursuing them. In addition, more than 1,000 remnants of the communist army's Li Biao and Shou Songtao units sneaked into Huqiao, southeast of Xiayi, on the 6th and have been surrounded by the National Army and are being severely attacked.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 8th] When the communist army's Liu Bocheng unit invaded northern Henan this time, the National Army left behind to guard the counties of Jun, Hua, Hui, and Chang, and when the communist army collapsed, they all came out to intercept them, causing the communist army to suffer unexpected losses. However, the reports that Hui and Hua counties were recovered are not true.</p>
<h3>Military and Civilian Cooperation, Greening Shandong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, 8th] Lu Chairman Wang Yaowu launched a afforestation movement to green Shandong. The plan is to plant 500 million trees this year. He has now mobilized the National Army stationed in Jinan and the people to plant millions of trees in the suburbs.</p>
<h3>Lu Construction Department to Develop Mineral Resources in the Yimeng Mountain Area</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, 8th] The Yimeng Mountain area in Shandong Province has abundant resources. The Lu Bureau is gradually expanding, and the Construction Department plans to develop its mineral products. The producing areas are Jinxing Village, Hongshiqiao, Tongjing and other places in Yishui, which produce gold. There was small-scale mining before the war. Mercuric Mountain produces mercury, and Mengyin Hongmianzhuang Zhenxiaoya also produces gold. Tie, jade, diamonds, mercury, crystals, etc. are found everywhere in the Changmazhuang area. Gang is produced in Tongcun, Xixiang, Huangcaiyan. Jinbaoshan, at the junction of Juxian and Yishui, produces gold and silver. Zhangdian, 60 li southwest of Tancheng, produced silica sand before the war. This kind of ore is a crystal with very large particles, which can be used to make cement and as a raw material for glass. Before the war, the people established the Hongxing Factory to mine it. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese used the latest machinery to mine the Zhangzhuang Coal Mine in southeast Xintai, and its output surpassed the Zaozhuang Coal Mine, and the scale was large. In addition, the Xinlai area is rich in glass raw materials. In addition to minerals, the agricultural products in the area, such as soybeans, tobacco, ginger, and sesame, are also abundant.</p>
<h3>Rongcheng Relieved, National Army Presses on Anxin</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 8th] The flames of war are raging in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The Battle of Rongcheng has come to an end. The communist army suffered heavy casualties. At 2:00 AM on the 8th, the three National Armies rushed to the city. The communist army could not hold on and retreated in different directions. The siege of Rongcheng was lifted. The National Army is now severely suppressing the remaining communist troops in the suburbs. This battle is another major victory for the National Army after the battles of Yaocun and Xushui. In addition, the National Army in Baoding has penetrated into Anxin and is currently fighting fiercely with the communist army 6 kilometers away from the city. The communist army has transported all the supplies in the city to the east, and the recovery of Anxin County is just around the corner. Also, the flames of war have risen again in Mancheng. Nie Rongzhen's troops have been attacking the suburbs for days, and the National Army is fighting bravely. The communist troops in the Baoshi section have recently been transferred north. A unit attacked Yujiazhuang yesterday but failed and retreated.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] Rongcheng in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway was besieged by two brigades of the communist army. On the 7th, the National Army reinforced it, and the communist army suffered more than half of its casualties. By noon on the 8th, the communist army could not hold on and retreated eastward, and the siege of the city was lifted. The communist army northeast of Baoding is preparing to retreat. The railway between Xushui and Caohe that was destroyed has been repaired.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 8th] Chen Jicheng, deputy director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, said that the traffic on the Pingjin Railway is becoming more and more stable due to the recovery of Yongqing. The recovery of Xiongxian and Baxian is only a matter of time. The Pingjinbao triangle area will continue to be cleared. The traffic between Tianjin and Cangxian on the Jinpu Line is good, with very little damage. It is expected that it will not be difficult to open up the line between Cangxian and Jinan.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan's Routine Meeting Passes Amended Stamp Tax Law, Chen Yanjiong Appointed Chairman of the Chinese Changchun Railway</h3>

<p>CCP's Indiscriminate Issuance of Border Currency Causes Alarming Prices in the Communist Area</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yan'an Dispatch, 8th] The pseudo "border currency" was already worthless when the CCP controlled northern Shaanxi. Ordinary people regarded it as waste paper. Its exchange rate with the legal tender was twenty to one, that is, twenty yuan of "border currency" could be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender. Seeing that its currency price was falling day by day, the CCP knew that it was difficult to gain the trust of the people, so it issued another kind of "commercial circulation voucher." Initially, it was determined that twenty yuan of "border currency" could be exchanged for one yuan of "circulation voucher." In January of this year, because it launched the spring offensive, the military needs were huge, and it forcibly increased the ratio, stipulating that seven yuan of "border currency" could be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender. One yuan of "circulation voucher" could be exchanged for three yuan of legal tender. However, all kinds of pseudo-currencies were only issued but not collected. The people were not allowed to store gold and silver, nor were they allowed to use legal tender. They had to exchange "border currency" or "circulation voucher" from the "Border Region Bank" before they were allowed to circulate in the market. The prices in Yan'an under the rule of the CCP were higher than anywhere else in the country. Yellow rice sold for 1.4 million "border currency" per dan, wheat for 1.2 million yuan per dan, millet for more than 800,000 yuan, sorghum for 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, white cloth for 18,000 yuan per foot, colored cloth for 31,000 yuan per foot, a sesame cake for 4,000 yuan, oily pastry for 1,000 yuan, a fried dough stick for 4,000 yuan, and a small box of matches for 4,000 yuan.</p>

This communication has eight articles and was found by the National Army near Yan'an.</p>

<p>Deputy Director Pan then reported on the disaster situation in the Yellow River flood area, saying that there are 20 counties in Henan Province that have been flooded, of which 10 counties are less severely affected, but the general disaster situation is extremely tragic. Selling children and selling daughters, pulling clothes and crying, and even grass roots and tree bark have been completely dug up. Since the Yellow River was diverted back to its old course, refugees have returned to their hometowns one after another, but it is still difficult to make a living.</p>
<p>The Countryside Must Be Sound</p>
<p>Mr. Hart expressed his great admiration for some young people who abandoned their studies and university degrees to participate in the disaster relief work in the Yellow River flood area. At the same time, he was deeply moved by the service spirit of Director Ma and the disaster relief workers. He also said: 80% of the people in China are farmers. To build a new China and establish a sound rural economy is a major task, and to complete this task, we must rely on the farmers who live in hardship. We should do our best to provide relief and assistance, and it is time for the Chinese people to work hard for the country.</p>
<p>Hopes of the Appeal Group</p>
<p>Some representatives of the Appeal Group are currently petitioning in Beijing, while Shang Shaoheng, representing the group here, expressed gratitude for the work of the Executive Yuan, but said that closing the breach is a passive task, and rebuilding the flood area is an active task. Therefore, he hopes for three things: (1) In terms of time, he hopes that the reconstruction work will be done as soon as possible, otherwise the arable land will become barren in two years. (2) In terms of organization, he hopes that it can be unified and sound, and not become a situation where one plan is one organization. (3) To request more financial and material assistance from China and other countries.</p>
<p>During the meeting, some reporters from this city requested to go to the flood area to inspect the disaster situation in person. Director Ma and others agreed to contact the authorities for a reply. Mr. Ma is scheduled to return to Henan today.</p>

<h3>Lattimore Looks at China: Social Structure Needs to Be Reorganized; Labor Still Feels Extremely Lacking</h3>
<p>[United Press Princeton, New Jersey Dispatch on the 8th] Owen Lattimore, Director of the International Relations Department of Johns Hopkins University (formerly translated as "La Tiemoer," the name Lattimore was taken by Xu Shiying for him), who once served as a political adviser to Chairman Chiang, said today at the 200th Anniversary Symposium on Far Eastern Cultural Society at Princeton University: China's ability to accept industrial and technical assistance is currently limited, so its social structure needs to be reorganized. Although China has a large population, the extreme shortage of labor still exists throughout the country. In addition, Clesse of Syracuse University, who once served as an assistant professor at Shanghai University, predicted that China will have some great industries within ten years. China has abundant coal reserves, but lacks other minerals, so China's industrialization is difficult to match the United States or Europe.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of Methods for Allotting State-Operated Enterprises to Private Management</h3>
<p>Following the announcement of the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan," the government immediately prepared to transfer state-operated enterprises to private management and exchanged opinions with Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. The "Methods for Allotting State-Operated Enterprises to Private Management" has now been approved by the National Government and was promulgated on the 7th; the full text was published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. These methods are based on item D of the first article of the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan." Its purpose is to attract idle capital to balance the budget. The transfer of state-operated enterprises to private management is the most popular item among the people in the entire measures plan. Because the implementation methods have been under discussion for a long time without a decision, it has caused considerable doubts among the people. Now that the methods have been promulgated, the transfer of state-operated enterprises to private management will surely be realized in the near future. This major event in the economic world, its development and its results, are naturally valued by the industrial community and society!</p>
<p>Overall, the "Methods for Allotting State-Operated Enterprises to Private Management" consists of eight articles, which make general provisions regarding the departments and methods for selling state-operated enterprises. In terms of the scope of the enterprises to be sold, they include: (1) The China Textile Construction Corporation, initially selling 70%, with the remaining 30% to be continued to be operated by the company; (2) The China Aquatic Products Company, China Tobacco Company, and eight other units, to be sold entirely to private management; the original 40% government shares of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company will also be sold entirely to private management; (3) For originally established state-operated companies, such as the China Silk Company and the China Salt Industry Company, 50% of the shares will first be issued to the people through public sale of stocks. In terms of sales methods, the partial or complete sale of enterprises such as China Textile and China Tobacco will generally be handled by a special committee organized by the competent authority. The selling price will be estimated based on market prices and operating conditions, and will be valid for six months. The sale of each enterprise will be through public bidding; larger ones will be organized into a joint-stock company by the acquirer, and a certain number of shares will be publicly offered and may be listed on the exchange. The method for issuing shares for the original state-operated companies is for the company to issue shares to the people and their business organizations; state-owned banks and bureaus are not allowed to purchase them. Government shares and private shares will be treated equally. In the future, they will be reorganized in accordance with the Company Law, with no special privileges. If the government deems it necessary to sell the remaining 50% of the government shares to the people, they will still be sold to private management. Regarding this method, the importance of the departments of the enterprises to be sold is not discussed for the moment. However, from the simple content of the sales method, it is possible to see that there are many technical problems, and it is necessary to study them.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the sales method. According to regulations, China Textile is selling 70% and not the entire company. China Textile is a large organic organization with a total of 71 factories, including 26 in Shanghai, 12 in Qingdao, 13 in Tianjin, and 10 in the Northeast. Its nature includes cotton spinning, printing and dyeing, wool spinning, hemp, silk, machinery, and affiliated units. If the sales method cannot match the sale, or only the printing and dyeing is sold without the textile, or the spinning and dyeing are sold but the machinery is retained, then private operation will inevitably be fraught with difficulties. Especially in terms of price, after the victory, the value of all China Textile factories has exceeded two trillion, and other raw materials are worth more than one trillion to one and a half trillion, for a total value of three and a half trillion. This time, the allotment is based on "market prices" and "operating conditions." At a time when prices are rising and raw materials are expensive, it remains to be seen whether it will meet the needs of the people and stimulate the interest of idle capital. As for China Silk and China Salt, they do not adopt a full allotment method, but rather the company issues 50% of its shares, which serves to attract business shares and is not private management. The methods are still state-operated. Thus, the so-called allotment of state-operated enterprises to private management is a mixture of "state-operated" and "private management," which is still a distance from a thorough transfer policy. Therefore, it is said that the competent authority still needs to make reasonable decisions on the sales method in terms of policy and technology.</p>
<p>The sale of state-operated enterprises to private management is something that the government is bound to do, and the people have been waiting for it for a long time. We hope that for this measure, which is most favored by the people, the government must conduct more technical reviews and solicit public opinion; the policy may as well be relaxed, and do not hold the attitude of "waiting for a good price to sell"; even if it is cheap for the people, it will not harm the national treasury, and it can also have the effect of supporting national capital. We believe that this issue is important, and we offer the following opinions for the reference of the competent authority.</p>
<p>1. The government should promptly announce the prices of the enterprises to be allotted. The committee's estimation of prices and the placement of factory machinery should incorporate the opinions of the industrial community and the people to make it reasonable, so as to achieve the effect of attracting idle capital and supporting private management policies. If they act arbitrarily, the people will inevitably wait and see.</p>
<p>2. Bidding is beneficial to the seller, because the seller must sell to the highest bidder. The China Tobacco Company and other most profitable enterprises can use bidding methods. For other departments or larger institutions, the acquirer should organize a company as soon as possible and issue its own shares. At the same time, it seems that the location for issuing shares should not be limited to Shanghai; it can be issued widely throughout the country at the same time. On the one hand, it avoids large households manipulating stocks, and on the other hand, it can limit the exchange of China Textile's shares, and match them with other state-operated enterprises.</p>
<p>3. It is necessary to prevent the manipulation of capital by powerful families. The control of China's economy by powerful families is an undeniable fact. The allotment of state-operated enterprises must allow private industries to truly establish themselves. If they are acquired by powerful families, the harm to the country and the people in the future is worrying. The examples of Mitsubishi and Mitsui in Japan are not far away and must be observed!</p>
<p>4. It is necessary to pay attention to whether various state-operated enterprises can enjoy the various conveniences of the state-operated period after they are transferred to private management. If the future private industries are still in the same situation as in the past, suffering from high taxes and monopolized raw materials, production will inevitably shrink, and private industries will still not be able to establish themselves soundly. In order to seek the future prosperity of private industrial units after the increase, the government must have a reasonable industrial policy at present, giving the transferred private industries various conveniences for development in their careers.</p>
<p>In short, the sale of state-operated enterprises to private management is a measure supported by the people and hoped for by the industrial community. Now that the methods have been announced and the scope of the enterprises to be sold has been determined, there are many technical problems and the relationship is very important. It is hoped that the government will make a decision quickly and solicit public opinion. For this measure, do not focus solely on financial considerations, but should focus on the country's industrial policy, then the significance of the sale of state-operated enterprises to private management will surely be supported by the people, and its success will surely have brilliant results in economic history!</p>

<h3>Gromyko Vigorously Criticizes the US Aid Plan to Greece and Turkey, Saying It Is Equivalent to Interfering in the Internal Affairs of Greece and Turkey; British Representative Cadogan Fully Supports the US Position</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Lake Success, New York, 7th] Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a speech in the Security Council today, accusing the United States of its policy of aiding Greece and Turkey, saying that it is overstepping its bounds as far as the United Nations is concerned. He said: "The United States argues that its actions to aid Greece and Turkey will help strengthen the strength of the United Nations organization and are in line with the principles and goals of the United Nations organization. This argument is difficult to agree with. The actions of the United States not only fail to enhance the status of the United Nations organization, but also weaken its status, damage its authority, and are enough to make people doubt the true goals of the United Nations organization and hinder the development of friendly relations between countries."</p>
<p>Regarding the US plan to send coaches to Greece, Gromyko said: No one can deny that this move constitutes interference in the internal affairs of Greece and a serious blow to the country's independence. The Greek people should receive more respectful treatment than the United States treats Greece. Aid to Greece should be based on the interests of the Greek people and should never become a tool for foreign forces in Greece. As for Turkey, in terms of its position in the last war, it should not have the right to obtain external aid, because Turkey did not suffer any damage during the war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] After Gromyko criticized the US plan to aid Greece and Turkey in the Security Council, British Representative Cadogan replied, saying: The United Nations cannot provide Greece with the aid it needs, so Britain approves of the US plan. This move is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations. Cadogan also agreed with the US representative's proposal to establish a standing committee in the Balkans to be responsible for guarding the borders of the Balkan countries. Australian Representative Hodge also expressed approval of the US motion. Syrian Representative El-Khoury requested that the Security Council put aside the Greek issue and argued that it should be submitted for discussion after receiving the report of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The United Nations Security Council decided today to postpone the discussion of the Greek issue until Thursday. Prior to that, no vote was taken on Soviet Representative Gromyko's suggestion to transfer the aid to Greece issue to the United Nations for handling, and US Representative Austin's suggestion that the Balkan Investigation Team continue to stay in Greece pending the Security Council's decision on how to handle it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] Soviet Representative Gromyko vehemently criticized the United States' "unilateral actions" in the Security Council on the night of the 7th, calling President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey an interference in the internal affairs of the two countries. Gromyko proposed that aid to Greece should be handled by a special committee established by the Security Council, which would give the United Nations organization the power to supervise it. This was unexpected, and representatives of various countries have urgently telegraphed their governments to indicate this. The first reaction caused by the Soviet proposal is to make people feel that the proposed supervision will definitely stipulate that aid funds must not be used for any military purposes, but this is one of the main purposes of the US plan, so its proposal is difficult for the US to accept.</p>
<h3>The US Senate Completes Preparations to Discuss the Aid Plan to Greece and Turkey; Vandenberg May Reply to Soviet Accusations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The Senate today completed the procedures to prepare for a discussion of the aid plan to Greece and Turkey on Tuesday, regardless of Soviet Representative Gromyko's claim that this plan undermines the United Nations organization. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said that he might reply to Gromyko's accusations in the United Nations Security Council yesterday. Other senators have different views. Democratic Senator George said, "It seems unreasonable for Gromyko to portray himself as a defender of the United Nations. We have tried every means to show that we are not abandoning the United Nations organization, but rather want to strengthen it." Democratic Senator Pepper agreed with Gromyko's proposal, believing that the Soviet Union is willing to jointly aid Greece. Pepper also proposed that the United States hand over the funds for relief to Greece to the United Nations organization, and that the issue of military aid to Greece and Turkey be handled by the Security Council. Republican Senator Smith said that he believed Gromyko's reaction was natural, but he did not admit that the United States had abandoned the United Nations. It is said that "I believe that Austin's statement, coupled with Vandenberg's amendment, makes it very proper to introduce the United Nations organization into it." Democratic Senator McClellan proposed in the Senate Review Committee that the United States cut off all financial aid to the Soviet Union and its seven vassal states. McClellan requested an amendment to the $350 million foreign relief bill to prohibit the use of cash to aid the Soviet Union, Albania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, because this bill is difficult to coexist with President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey to prevent communism bill, and is contradictory.</p>
<h3>Wallace Arrives in England to Discuss His Mission to Europe</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] London, 8th Broadcast: Wallace arrived here today, completing the first stage of his European tour. According to his statement to reporters at the airport, the current world crisis is extremely serious. He also said that if there is no true mutual understanding between countries, there will be no union. Wallace will stay until the 17th before leaving England.</p>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, New York, 7th] Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace said before boarding the plane to England today that he is taking the goodwill and friendship of millions of progressive people in the United States to the powerful progressive and democratic people in Europe. All progressive people must unite, because world peace and the welfare of the people are based on this unity. He mentioned the US aid plan to Greece and Turkey, saying that when he was Secretary of Commerce, he approved of the aid plan to Greece. There were many opponents at the time, but he still tried his best to advocate it, but he never advocated military aid to Greece, and this position remains unchanged to this day. When he resigned, he stated his opposition to all forms of imperialism, whether it is British or American imperialism. Wallace also believes that Senator Vandenberg's proposed amendment, which allows the United Nations organization to intervene in US aid to Greece and Turkey under certain conditions, is a good gesture. He believes that any event related to world peace should be handled by the United Nations organization. Wallace's trip to Europe is intended to obtain the reaction of ordinary people to US foreign policy, and he plans to meet with leaders of various European governments to enhance the mission of the United Nations organization and promote the international recovery plan.</p>
<h3>British Labor Party Groups Criticize Bevin's Policies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, who is currently attending the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow, was once again criticized today by powerful groups within the Labor Party for his "harmful" foreign policy. During the Easter holiday, many representatives attending the Cooperative Party annual meeting and the smaller-scale Trades Union Congress meeting have passed resolutions calling for a change in Bevin's foreign policy. The Cooperative Party is an important part of the Labor Party, and almost half of the Cooperative Party opposes Bevin's foreign policy.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Adopts a Delaying Policy; The Foreign Ministers Conference Achieves Nothing; Discussions on the German Political System Are Fruitless</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] Moscow, 8th Broadcast: In the past four weeks, the United Kingdom and the United States have avoided making direct criticisms of the Soviet Union in the Foreign Ministers Conference, but in last night's meeting, they openly accused the Soviet Union of its attempt to communize Germany. Marshall attempted to actively discuss the second half of the agenda, but in the past ten days, he has been repeatedly hindered by Molotov. Marshall expressed great dissatisfaction with this, and in the next day or two, he will make a more severe statement, stating that the US cannot make any more concessions. If the Soviet Union does not stop its obstructive policy, the conference will end without success.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 8th] Marshall and Bevin indirectly accused the Soviet Union last night of attempting to use the German people as tools to ensure that the Communist Party can occupy a majority position in the German government. Yesterday, the Soviet Union insisted on holding a referendum of the German people to decide whether there should be a strong central government or a federal government. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France condemned it as a threat to world peace. Marshall said, "The United States does not want Germany to have a central government that may turn into a dictatorial government, which would be a threat to world peace. The United States only wants Germany to have a central government based in various states."</p>
<p>He also said, "It is impossible for the German people to express their true will today or in the near future. Drafting a constitution is a very complicated procedure, and holding a referendum during the transition period would be extremely dangerous for peace."</p>
<p>Bevin also reminded Molotov that a strong German government has twice caused world wars, and Hitler used referendums as a tool to seize power under this kind of political system. "I will never agree to the suggestion that British security should be decided by the German people." Marshall also criticized the referendum for possibly creating "the impression that the member states of the Foreign Ministers Conference are using the German people as tools and playing political tricks." Bevin said, "Mr. Molotov's suggestion may have a basis in theory, but for the sake of security, I will definitely oppose it. I don't care whether the German government is communist, socialist, or dictatorial, what I care about is peace." Molotov also retorted that Bevin's position could truly create the impression that the four powers want to divide Germany. Bevin replied that he had agreed to the unification of Germany, but the power of the central government must be limited. He simply did not want to discuss the idea that such an important issue could be handed over to the German people for a decision. Marshall said that a referendum could be held after the German permanent constitution is drafted and approved by the Allied countries. After three and a half hours of heated debate, the issue was shelved and the agenda for tomorrow was discussed. Marshall suggested discussing the German border, the Ruhr, the Rhineland, and the US proposal for German disarmament. Molotov opposed it, saying that he wanted to resolve the outstanding issues first. Marshall then agreed. Bevin expressed fatigue and impatience with the lack of agreement in the past week and the fact that there are still fourteen agenda items that have not been discussed at all.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 8th] US sources said today: Unless the Soviet side stops its obstructive tactics at the Foreign Ministers Conference, the entire conference is about to end. A showdown between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the foreign ministers of the Western countries is in the making. The basic question is whether the four countries should continue to deliberate on the German issue at length, or whether they can turn to discuss borders and other matters, and whether there is a possibility of reaching an agreement on Austria. Regarding Germany, the issue has been discussed in detail, and the opinions of various countries have now been explained. There is no way to discuss it further. If the Soviet side is unwilling to discuss other matters, the conference will end. According to Western diplomats, the Soviet suggestion to allow the German people to vote to choose the form of their future government is intended to offset the reaction of the German people to the Soviet demand for 10 billion US dollars in reparations.</p>
<h3>The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Complete the Report on the Austrian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] Moscow, 8th Broadcast: The Four Power Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty announced today the end of drafting the Austrian Peace Treaty, and passed the British and American suggestions to extend the conference from today. The four Deputy Foreign Ministers have completed their report to the foreign ministers, and unless the four Deputy Foreign Ministers issue further orders, they will no longer discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Items on the Agenda Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Moscow, 7th] The Foreign Ministers Conference has entered its fourth week today, and mutual accusations among representatives have made progress very difficult. Today's meeting started an hour late due to the late submission of the report by the Adjustment Committee. After a discussion on the issue of establishing a temporary German government, no compromise was reached and it had to be returned to the Adjustment Committee for review. There are still fourteen points that need to be discussed by the Foreign Ministers Conference, including: (1) Economic unification, including industrial standards and reparations; (2) Another report from the Adjustment Committee; (3) A report from the special committee discussing the remaining matters in the report of the Allied Control Council; (4) Population issues, including refugees and prisoners of war; (5) The disarmament of German military power; (6) The report of the Deputy Foreign Ministers on the procedures for concluding the German Peace Treaty; (7) The report of the Deputy Foreign Ministers on the Allied Reparations Committee; (8) The report of the Deputy Foreign Ministers on the opinions of the smaller Allied countries; (9) Land issues, including the future of the Ruhr and the Rhineland; (10) The Four Power Pact proposed by the United States; (11) The report of the coal experts; (12) The Austrian Peace Treaty (the foreign ministers have not yet started to discuss it); (13) The report of the Trieste Special Finance Committee, (14) The issue of restricting the stationed German occupation forces.</p>
<h3>The Automotive King Ford Passes Away at the Age of Eighty, Wealthy Beyond Royal Princes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Detroit, Michigan, 8th] A Ford Motor Company spokesman issued a brief statement today stating: "Henry Ford passed away at his Edsel Ford residence at 11:40 pm on the 7th." Ford was the Automotive King of England, born on July 30, 1863, and lived to be 83 years old. He devoted his life to the automotive industry, and founded the world-renowned Ford Motor Company, serving as chairman of the company for 18 years (1901 to 1919). Ford had one only son, who passed away in May 1943. He is now survived by his wife and two grandsons, one named Benson Ford and the other named Henry Ford II, the latter being the successor to the chairmanship of the Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p>[United Press, Detroit, 8th] The cause of Ford's death is still unknown. Ford followed the usual practice of going to Ford's winter estate in Georgia. When he returned home a week ago, it was said that he was in extremely good spirits. Throughout his life, he was unknown in the fields in his early years. Later, with the help of relatives and friends, he invested 28,000 yuan in the automotive industry, and was able to accumulate as much as 1 billion, becoming one of the world's richest people.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Detroit, 8th] When Ford passed away, it was raining heavily, causing the power to be cut off, so the room was only lit with candles and kerosene lamps, and wood was burned for warmth. Four hours before his death, Ford still went to the factory on the banks of the Rouge River to inspect the damage caused by the windstorm. Those who saw Ford off in front of his bed were his wife and a servant. At that time, the telephone was also cut off, so his driver drove to urgently summon the doctor, who only arrived half an hour after his death. According to his successor, Ford II, Ford died of a cerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<h3>Gromyko on Disarmament Advocates for the Early Establishment of a Disarmament Agency; Opposes the Disarmament Measures Proposed by the United Kingdom and the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Lake Success, New York, 7th] The Soviet Union stated today that it opposes the opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States that a system of security guarantees should be established before the United Nations organization can reduce armaments. Soviet Representative Gromyko told the United Nations Disarmament Committee that the disarmament resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly last December did not indicate that disarmament must be preceded by the establishment of a security system as a prerequisite, nor did it stipulate that security guarantees such as those required by the British and American representatives must be established. The resolution did not directly or indirectly mention that guarantees must be established before disarmament. On the contrary, the resolution pointed out the necessity of establishing a disarmament agency as soon as possible. After armaments are reduced, international security and trust will naturally be promoted. Gromyko then reiterated the position of the Soviet government, saying that the most urgent step is to conclude a convention to prevent atomic energy from being used for combat purposes. Without such a convention, it is difficult or even impossible to smoothly resolve the issue of international control of atomic energy. International control of atomic energy is absolutely necessary, but it is a separate matter from disarmament. Gromyko also opposed the British proposal to establish a United Nations army to maintain security before the United Nations organization begins disarmament. From the perspective of implementing the disarmament plan, this proposal is not good and is enough to hinder the progress of disarmament.</p>
<h3>America Does Not Wish to See Korea Divided: Hodge Discusses Establishing a Government in South Korea</h3>
<p>[Asia East News Agency, Seoul, 8th] General Hodge, recently returned to Korea from the United States, held a press conference at the Military Government Office at 10:00 AM today. Regarding the establishment of a Korean government, he stated: "While in the United States, I had numerous meetings with President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and other government officials to discuss the Korean issue. Although my time in the US was short, I made every effort to ensure that American officials and the public understood the situation in Korea. The current US policy towards Korea is definitely against establishing a separate government in South Korea that would divide the Korean peninsula. On the contrary, the United States desires to see a democratic and unified government established in Korea. Regarding the government to be formed after the upcoming general election in South Korea, it will allow Koreans to exercise administrative and judicial power themselves, but it does not transfer all sovereignty to this government." Regarding the unification of Korea, General Hodge stated that as long as the Soviet Union accepts the US proposal and fulfills the resolutions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the US-Soviet Joint Commission can be reconvened at any time to discuss the organization of a democratic and unified provisional government for Korea.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Advocates Forming a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Asia East News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Prime Minister Yoshida, who recently returned to Tokyo from the countryside, issued a statement on the current political situation on the 7th, stating that political stability can only be achieved under a national coalition. Yoshida stated that democratic politics requires all parties to maintain considerable strength, cooperate with each other, and move politics towards democratization. Therefore, he believes that it is necessary to avoid unnecessary political disputes at this time, to rebuild Japan economically, and that before Japan's economic reconstruction, all parties must work together politically. Yoshida said his idea of forming a coalition cabinet is based on this belief.</p>
<h3>The Land of Buddha Turns into Hell: Mahatma Gandhi Helpless and Confused</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] Gandhi stated today that the religious conflict in the Noakhali district of Bengal seems to be forcing Hindus to choose between life and death in a frenzy. Gandhi released a telegram from Congress Party members in Noakhali, stating that Muslims in the district intend to burn Hindus alive.

<h3>British Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, Auchinleck, Will Remain in His Post</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] Field Marshal Auchinleck, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, recently stated at a gathering of senior military officers that a certain reform plan is about to be implemented, which may greatly reduce the number of the Indian Army, reducing the total to 200,000 men, and the fleet will be supplemented by army units. It is heard that Auchinleck is highly regarded in India, and since it is easy to cause new struggles between the Indian and Muslim factions if an Indian is appointed as commander-in-chief, it is expected that Auchinleck will remain in his original position in India at the request of the Indian government.</p>

<h3>American Bituminous Coal Mines Almost Entirely Shut Down</h3>
<p>Lewis's Position is Gradually Strengthening</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] All bituminous coal in the United States has been shut down. Officials also acknowledge that the position of Lewis, president of the Miners' Union, is even stronger than when he called for a miners' strike last November. Lewis is now ordering miners to strike on the grounds that coal mines are unsafe, and the government is unlikely to be able to ask the court to issue an injunction to prohibit the miners' strike.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The US government announced today that 54,000 of the 400,000 bituminous coal miners under the leadership of Lewis, president of the Miners' Union, have disobeyed Lewis's orders and resumed work, but most miners still firmly support Lewis, and the government has in fact no way to deal with the "safety strike."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lisbon, 7th] Don Juan, the heir to the Spanish throne, issued a declaration to the people of the country tonight, formally stating that he does not intend to give up his undeniable right to inherit the throne. It stated: "Franco's law of succession to the throne does not take into account the need to establish a firm system in Spain, nor does it take into account the fact that the main reason the world hates Spain is that Franco is the head of Spain. Franco's proposal is only enough to allow him to continue his dictatorship for life under the guise of a monarchy."</p>
<h3>US Telephone Labor Dispute Deadlocked: Union Says it is Prepared for a Long-Term Strike</h3>

"There are no new developments in the negotiations to end the strike of 325,000 telephone workers across the country. We have not received any suggestions from the government to resolve the strike."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The first national telephone strike in American history has cut off 80% of long-distance calls, and many local calls have also been suspended. However, officials said that the mediation of the labor dispute is proceeding smoothly, and the striking workers in Jamestown, New York, have repeatedly received a 91% pay increase and ended the strike first.</p>

<h3>A Look at the General Election in Japan</h3>
<p>...This election is just a contest between parties for political institutions. The Japanese still need long-term re-education before they can implement thorough autonomy according to the wishes of the Allied countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] Serious Japanese are holding four major elections this month, and they realize that MacArthur's recent proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible has aroused worldwide attention to the Japanese political situation. Japanese newspapers are calling this Japan's current "major trial." The purpose of this election is to eliminate the old constitution and implement the new constitution that renounces war, which will take effect on May 3. According to Allied observers, this election is largely faithful and without disturbances, proving that this still semi-feudal country is continuing to progress towards democratic politics. But fundamentally, it is just a contest between parties for political institutions. The Japanese still need long-term re-education before they can implement thorough autonomy according to the wishes of the Allied countries.</p>
<p>Four Major Elections This Month</p>
<p>Voting began on April 5, the first being the election of county governors, mayors, and village chiefs, which is an innovation in Japanese history, as local officials were previously appointed. The second is the election of 300 members of the House of Councilors on April 20, which will replace the former House of Peers. Five days later, voters will elect 466 members of the House of Representatives. On April 30, there will also be elections for members of the county, city, and village councils.</p>
<p>The Left and Right Wings Confront Each Other</p>
<p>In various elections, thousands of candidates, including more than 100 women, have applied to have their resumes reviewed. Before they are allowed to participate in the election, they must prove that they did not engage in warmongering during the war. The fundamental issue in all elections is the opposition between the left and right wings, in other words, the opposition between the status quo and socialism or more radical programs. The Social Democratic Party proposes that major industries be immediately nationalized in order to complete socialism. The Communist Party is shouting "the rights of the common people." The major conservative parties do not have clear political programs. Only the Liberal Party (nominally Liberal, but in fact conservative) led by Yoshida, can be expected to win more than 30 seats in the House of Representatives, adding to its existing number of seats, making it 170 seats, which is indeed a majority party, but still far from being an absolute majority party. The Liberal Party's hopes are pinned on the many legacies of the old bureaucratic political institutions and the recent public aversion to labor tactics, which are largely consistent with the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The Progressive Party, the second largest conservative party, is expected to lose about the same number of seats as the Liberal Party wins, but it can maintain considerable strength to form a coalition with the Liberal Party and become a majority in the House of Representatives. The Progressive Party has 97 seats. It is said that the Progressive Party has decided to reorganize and change its name in response to the demands of young and active members of the party. Prime Minister Yoshida is a candidate for the House of Representatives for the Liberal Party. The election may give him the opportunity to be re-elected, no matter how the left wing opposes him.</p>
<p>The new constitution specifically stipulates that the prime minister must be a member of parliament. The Socialist Party is expected to win a great victory and jump to become the second largest party. The Communist Party has six existing members of the House of Representatives, and may increase to fifteen. There are also a considerable number of non-partisan people who may be elected, because the general Japanese voters are still looking for the middle ground that the parties have not revealed. Some small parties may lose the election.</p>
<p>The Cost of Campaigning is Considerable</p>
<p>Experts at MacArthur Headquarters frankly admit that local elections will be a major problem, as the old bureaucrats are trying to use voting to maintain their power. There are very few opposition candidates. At the same time, the style of old politics is visible everywhere. The conservative parties are spending hundreds of millions of yen on campaign expenses, and even the Communist Party has spent 10 million yen. Some Japanese speculate that the price of one member of the House of Representatives being elected is 500,000 yen (10,000 yen is equivalent to one US dollar). They also predict that 40 million citizens will vote enthusiastically, but they do not explain the extent of the enthusiasm.</p>

<h3>Strange Fire at Maochang Warehouse This Morning: Doors and Windows Locked, Suspicions of Arson: Evidence of Arson Found in a Fire on Jianguo West Road</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 0:20 AM this morning, thick smoke suddenly emerged from the second floor of the Maochang Company's warehouse at 60 Nanxun Road. When passers-by discovered it and sounded the alarm, flames were already rising and black smoke covered the sky. The fire department was contacted and sent vehicles to the scene to extinguish the fire. As of the time this newspaper went to press, the fire had not yet abated.</p>
<p>The site is the Hongkou office of Maochang Company, which has many warehouses, covering a very wide area. The main entrance is at 229 Huangpu Road, and the fire broke out at the Nanxun Road warehouse, where warehouses are connected to each other. The Nanxun Road warehouse where the fire broke out is a three-story steel-concrete building. The ground floor, part of the second floor, and the entire third floor are used by the Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Bureau to store a large number of telecommunications materials. According to employees of the company, the remaining space on the second floor is rented by a Russian, who has stored dried fruits such as raisins and black dates. The day before yesterday, about 100 bags of cotton were also stored. After the storage was properly secured, the doors and windows were locked and closed. There were no employees stationed in the warehouse. After the fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of the warehouse, although firefighters arrived at the scene in time, they were unable to enter and extinguish the source of the fire for a while. They only relied on ladders and powerful water seedlings to break through the windows on the second floor and spray them remotely. At about 1:00 AM, the thick black smoke rising from the roof reached a height of tens of feet. The reporter could faintly see the flames rolling east and west inside from the windows. From time to time, there were one or two explosions. It is reported that it was caused by the explosion of the Telecommunications Bureau's foot-long giant vacuum tubes. The amount of loss this time must be huge, and the details are not yet known, but it is known that they are all insured.</p>
<p>The cause of the Maochang Company's fire is very strange. Inquiries have shown that there have been many consecutive major fires in the city recently, and this is another strange fire. The night before last, at about 9:00 PM, a fire also broke out in the alley near 627 Jianguo West Road. Afterwards, a burned-out straw bag filled with the smell of fuel oil was found, indicating that it must have been arson by criminals. The authorities are paying close attention to this. When firefighters were putting out the fire this morning, the police station also dispatched a large number of police officers with light machine guns to impose a strict curfew, and the situation was extremely tense.</p>
<h3>New Legal Tender Shipped from Abroad: One Box Missing During Delivery: Valued at 24 Million Yuan in 1,000 Yuan Denominations</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The American liner Raphael Semmes, which arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month, was represented by Hua Lun Yangxing and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. In addition to thousands of tons of goods shipped from the United States, there were 390 boxes of legal tender. Whenever the National Bank has new banknotes shipped in, it entrusts the Yuanhe Public Customs Brokerage on Sichuan Road to handle customs declaration and delivery procedures. After the above-mentioned banknotes arrived in Shanghai, the brokerage proceeded with customs declaration procedures. The customs declaration was completed on Saturday afternoon, and it was planned to submit them to the National Bank on the ship immediately. However, because the National Bank was closed on Saturday afternoon, no one accepted them, so they were not picked up. When they went to pick them up on Monday, they found that one box was missing, valued at 24 million yuan in 1,000 yuan denominations. It is reported that two overnight workers and several coolies have been detained and are currently under investigation.</p>

<h3>Sewage Treatment Plan: Tea Party Held for Review</h3>

<h3>Occupational Group Representatives Return to Shanghai: Yan Yilin Talks About the Petition Process</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wang Xiaohua, Wu Xiangxian, Yan Yilin, Ding Jiwan, Chen Cunren, Shi Zhifu, and other 30 representatives of Shanghai's occupational groups went to Beijing by train on the evening of the 6th to petition for an increase in the number of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators. They returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited the representative Yan Yilin to inquire about the petition process. According to the report, the petition of Shanghai's occupational groups this time coincided with the opinions of occupational groups across the country. After the representatives arrived in Beijing, they went to the National Defense Supreme Council to petition, and Zhang Daofan received them. The representatives put forward their opinions and requested that the ratio of the number of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators be increased to 36% (the National Defense Conference passed it as 18.4%). If this is not possible, the minimum should be 33.3%. The number decided by the Legislative Yuan this time is only more than 7%, which is extremely disappointing. Zhang immediately expressed sympathy and promised to convene a National Defense Conference specifically for the request of representatives of occupational groups to increase the number of seats within days, so as to reply after the decision. The representatives then went to the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, and other agencies to petition.</p>
<p>According to the petition representatives, if the government still does not accept the request this time, the representatives of the occupational groups will refuse to participate in the National Assembly and serve as legislators.</p>
<h3>The Tongji University Strike Wave Expands: Allegations of Organized Conspiracy in Soldier Assault on Students; Three Demands Presented for Petition to City Government and Police Department Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, at 2 PM, a school bus from Tongji University in this city, originating from the Faculty of Law in the new city district (the faculty's address is adjacent to the Third Battalion, Seventh Company of the Second Transport Regiment, sharing a common entrance through the university's museum), was departing when soldiers, unable to board the bus, initiated a dispute, resulting in injuries to eight students, including Li Boqin. This sparked outrage among the entire student body. Since yesterday, both the Faculty of Law and the Freshman Academy have been protesting through a coordinated strike. The strike wave is steadily growing, and over three thousand students from the university's Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Faculty of Medicine are striking today to show their support. Three demands have been put forward: (1) The stationed troops must immediately withdraw from the university area. (2) The responsible authorities must severely punish the officers and soldiers responsible for this incident. (3) The military authorities must issue a public apology in the newspapers and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.</p>
<p>President Dong Urges Resumption of Classes</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2 PM, the Student Union convened an emergency meeting of all representatives at the Faculty of Engineering and invited University President Dong Xifan to report on the negotiations following the incident. He stated that the cause of the incident stemmed from the soldiers' attempt to board the school bus. The school buses are extremely crowded, making it impossible to allow soldiers to ride. Furthermore, the Public Utilities Bureau had repeatedly warned that non-students were strictly prohibited from boarding the school buses. The resulting conflict was regrettable. After the incident, he had visited the Garrison Commander, the Port Commander, and Chief of Staff He, all of whom expressed their deepest apologies and pledged a thorough investigation to ensure that similar incidents would not happen again. He added that the soldiers' troublemaking was undoubtedly wrong and would be dealt with severely after verification. President Dong also stated that since the university had already intervened and achieved considerable progress, he hoped that the students would resume classes from tomorrow to avoid wasting their studies. As for the museum, it originally belonged to the university, and the city government has already returned it for the university's use. The stationed troops should therefore withdraw as soon as possible, and the university is currently negotiating this matter.</p>
<p>Students Refuse to Yield</p>
<p>After President Dong left, representatives from various faculties rose to report on what they had witnessed on the day of the incident and their experiences of being insulted. They unanimously believed that the matter had not been thoroughly resolved and that the promises were merely verbal. This has happened before, and soldiers often failed to comply. Moreover, the current collective assault by soldiers clearly indicated an organized conspiracy. In the past month, similar incidents have occurred repeatedly. Student Lin Wei was previously shot and wounded by stationed troops, and Chen Daxin was later run over by a military vehicle. This time, the blatant assault on students from the Faculty of Law was considered intolerable. Unless a thorough resolution is reached, they will not resume classes. The Student Union has scheduled representatives to petition the city government and the Garrison Headquarters this morning. If a satisfactory outcome is not achieved, they will stage a large-scale demonstration and call upon all universities in the city to respond and take united action.</p>
<h3>Labor and Management in the Private Shipping Industry Reach Agreement; Mediation of the Hua Cheng Tobacco Factory Dispute Yields No Result</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Labor and management in the private shipping industry have reached an agreement. The key points agreed upon are: (1) Seamen's wages are 320,000 yuan per month for short voyages and 330,000 yuan per month for long voyages, with food expenses to be borne by the labor side.

<p>A woolen dyeing and weaving factory at No. 31, Lane 98, Xujiahui Road, Yude Road, due to poor business and inability to weave on its own, has decided to provide commissioned weaving services as a means of covering expenses. Ninety-four employees expressed their willingness to support this, while forty-four opposed it. The factory has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to dismiss the forty-four uncooperative employees.</p>
<p>Employees of the Hua Cheng Tobacco Factory have presented ten demands to the management, the main ones being: (1) Employees who have reached the age of sixty should be allowed to retire and receive retirement pay equivalent to one month's salary for each year of service. (2) Piecework should be based on a seven-hour workday. If there is no work and the workday is less than seven hours, the management should provide a subsidy of one jiao per hour based on the basic salary. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties for mediation, but no agreement was reached.</p>

<h3>Paying Respects at the Battlefield: Luo Zhuoying Visits Luodian</h3>

<h3>Major Industrial Project: Building Seven Factories to Produce Rayon, US Experts in Shanghai to Discuss Technical Assistance Agreement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In an exquisitely decorated room at the Cathay Hotel, a reporter had a long conversation with a representative from an American rayon company lasting over an hour. From this conversation, it was learned that the rayon industry may soon be established in China. The visitor, Ralph Coe, Secretary of the American Osgoe Koe Company (pictured), has been in China for nearly ten days with the mission of negotiating with a major industrialist in China, hoping to sign a factory construction contract in the near future.</p>
<p>According to Coe, there are plans to build as many as seven rayon (the new term for artificial silk) factories in China. These will include three categories: (1) three 5-ton rayon factories, (2) one 5-ton and one 10-ton staple fiber factory each, and (3) two 1-ton cellophane factories. The factories will be located within approximately 200 miles of Shanghai. The exact location will depend on the quality and quantity of the water source. The amount of capital involved is substantial. According to the expert's estimate, the total capital required for a 5-ton factory is as high as 10 million US dollars. The total number is enormous, as can be seen from this figure. However, Mr. Coe emphasized that the capital is entirely borne by Chinese investors. His company in the United States will only provide comprehensive technical assistance. This system is called the Single Contract System, which includes five tasks: (1) selecting the factory site, (2) delivering the necessary machinery, (3) constructing all the required components, (4) selecting all the technicians needed for the factory to be trained at Coe's company in the United States, (5) dispatching experts from Coe's company to China to provide guidance until all seven factories are successfully operational and manufacturing. As of yesterday, the terms of the contract were still under negotiation, but two items are practically resolved. He believes that the contract can be signed smoothly when he leaves China on the 25th of this month. After signing, the company can guarantee in writing that the factory will officially start production within 18 months. Coe declined to identify who he was negotiating with, only saying that three people had visited the United States for negotiations in the past, and the Chinese Embassy in the United States had also facilitated this in many ways.</p>
<p>He repeatedly pointed out that running this kind of industry in China is very profitable. In the United States, it costs only 65 cents US dollars per pound to manufacture rayon, but it sells for 3.50 US dollars in the Chinese market. The demand for Chinese rayon, before the war, had imports of 35 tons per month, not including smuggling, The accurate estimated need is 75 tons a day. Judging from China's area and population, the future of the rayon industry is unlimited. The difficulty of establishing a rayon factory is the large amount of capital needed, but this industry has a wide range of uses and may surpass the textile industry in the future.</p>
<p>The Osgoe Koe Company is the largest rayon enterprise in the United States, founded in 1909 by Osgoe Koe, who is the father of this visitor. This company owns 64 rayon factories, only five of which are in the United States, with the remainder overseas, mostly in Japan. The rest are distributed in South America and Europe, and recently have developed into Africa. Because of the wide distribution of its business, the company suffered considerable losses in this war. After the war, with the "Faustian" spirit of Americans in industry, they are developing to every corner of the world, and after Egypt and India, they have now found China.</p>

<h3>Suspects in Seymour Road Fire Case: Four Firefighters Interrogated Yesterday; Defendants Deny Looting During Fire; Sentencing Set for the 15th; Shenqing Bail Denied</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Shang Zhikui, Dai Guangrong, Li Chengjun, and Cai Zhiying, four firefighters who were derelict in their duties during the Seymour Road fire, are suspected of entering the residence of victim number 27 while the fire was still smoldering and stealing towels, handkerchiefs, cotton undershirts, and other items. Prosecutor Shen Zushou of the District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution against them on charges of banditry. The other nineteen individuals, including team leaders Huang Baoqi, Li Xun, and Zhu Qinglan, are being prosecuted in a separate case on charges of public endangerment and theft. At 10 AM yesterday morning, Judge Mei Erhe of the Eighth Criminal Division of the District Court interrogated the four defendants charged with banditry. After the debate concluded, sentencing was scheduled for the 15th of this month. The nineteen defendants facing charges of public endangerment and theft are scheduled to be tried on the 15th.</p>
<p>After Judge Mei called the roll, he conducted separate interrogations. According to Shang Zhikui's testimony: He is the police chief of the Yichang Road Fire Brigade. On the evening of January 22nd of this year, a coppersmith's workshop at 452 Wuding Road caught fire, spreading to the entire Lane 660. He, the defendant, was ordered to lead his subordinates Dai Guangrong, Li Chengjun, and Cai Zhiying to the fire scene to extinguish the flames. At that time, because there were still smoldering embers at number 27, he ordered Cai Zhiying to go upstairs to put out the fire, and Dai and Li also went upstairs to assist. Later, Cai left first. Shang testified that he has been a firefighter for twenty-one years and has never engaged in any misconduct. The allegations of stealing property are completely false. The three defendants, Dai Guangrong, Li Chengjun, and Cai Zhiying, also denied looting during the fire, claiming that the victims, after suffering from the disaster, had nowhere to vent their grievances and therefore fabricated false accusations. The court then summoned witness Zhou Qifang (nephew of Zhou Xiuzhen, the owner of house number 27), who testified that at around 8 AM on the 23rd, while the embers were still smoldering, he was concerned about his home and managed to borrow a ladder to climb in through the window to check. He saw the four firefighters rummaging through boxes and cabinets, looting property. They made no attempt to hide their actions and even ordered him to open boxes for them to search. He identified Shang Zhikui, Li Chengjun, and Dai Guangrong in court as the ones who were looting at the time. He was less certain about whether Cai Zhiying was also present. After the interrogation was completed, the court announced the start of the debate. Prosecutor Shen Zushou stood up to argue, requesting that the court severely punish the four defendants for banditry. The defendants' defense lawyer argued that taking items like towels and handkerchiefs was for wiping up water stains and could not be considered stealing property. It was impossible for the four firefighters to give irresistible threats for Zhou Qifang on the top floor, so it was not enough to constitute banditry. He also applied for bail, which was rejected by the court.</p>

<h3>A Cook is Strangled to Death at the Shanghai Provincial High School</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A strangled male body was discovered at around 6 AM yesterday morning in the canal in front of the gate of Shanghai Provincial High School, Wujia Lane, Hu Min Road, in the southern suburbs of Shanghai. After the Changqiao Police Station of the Suppression of Bandits Police Branch received the report, they immediately sent personnel to retrieve the body.

<h3>The Ministry of Justice Specifies Precautions for Handling Cases Involving Accused Civil Servants</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court recently received instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration regarding precautions to be taken by judicial authorities when handling cases involving accused civil servants. The regulations are very detailed, and the main points are summarized as follows: (1) People who accuse or report civil servants are legally responsible, and the prosecutor should conduct a preliminary investigation and sincerely explain this. (2) When the prosecutor conducts an investigation, he should pay attention to both favorable and unfavorable circumstances for the defendant. Unless necessary, the defendant should not be summoned for questioning in advance. (3) For cases where the most severe punishment is detention or a fine, the court or prosecutor should allow the defendant to appoint an agent to appear on their behalf, unless there is a necessary situation. (4) In cases where a civil servant is the defendant, the court or prosecutor should not notify the relevant superior officer when summoning or detaining the defendant, unless it is deemed necessary. However, if the defendant is a current military personnel or military dependent, the relevant superior officer should be notified of the detention warrant to assist in its execution. (5) After the court or prosecutor detains or arrests a civil servant, they should notify the relevant superior officer and pay attention to the defendant's physical health and reputation. (6) The court may question the plaintiff and collect or investigate evidence in a non-public manner before the first trial date. If it is discovered that the case is a civil matter or is using the private prosecution procedure to intimidate the defendant, the court may advise the plaintiff to withdraw the prosecution. If the court believes that there is insufficient evidence or no crime was committed, it may reject the prosecution. (7) The defendant should be questioned with a sincere attitude and not through violence, coercion, bribery, deception, or other improper methods. After the defendant has been questioned, the court or prosecutor should not detain them unless it is deemed necessary under the circumstances specified in Article 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (8) If the defendant has legal grounds for detention but detention is not necessary, the court or prosecutor may directly order bail, bail with guarantee, or restricted residence. (9) In cases where a detention fine should be imposed or where a verdict of pardon or acquittal should be made, the court may render a judgment in absentia without waiting for the defendant's statement if the defendant has been legally summoned and fails to appear in court without justifiable reason. (10) If the court or prosecutor knows of any possible false accusation when handling cases involving accused civil servants, they should immediately report it. (11) The outcome of the trial may be notified to the relevant superior officer, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<h3>Letter from a Child Clarifying a Mistake</h3>

Yesterday, an eight-year-old child, Huang Junjie, sent a letter clarifying that "Junjie" was a misprint for "Junjie".

This is appended above and apologies are given.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Right of Way on CaoBao Road: City Council Mediation Yields No Result</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the dispute over the right of way on CaoBao Road, the City Council convened a meeting yesterday at 3 PM, bringing together the responsible parties from both sides, along with several councilors and representatives from the Public Utilities Bureau, to review the points of contention. The meeting concluded without a final decision, as both sides maintained their positions. According to the report from Gao Liansun, the representative of the Shanghai-Minhang Transportation Company: (1) The company was established in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], and the road construction subsidy totaled 65,000 yuan, payable in three installments. The first two installments were already paid in full, and the third installment was due on August 14th of the 26th year, but was suspended due to the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, and was only paid this year with an additional 20 million+ yuan. (2) The inability to open the road to traffic immediately is due to the lack of a traffic permit. (3) The company has not received an order to open the road to traffic by a certain deadline and cannot be held responsible. (4) The Transportation Committee proceeded to open the road to traffic without the permission of the Public Utilities Bureau, which seems inappropriate. (5) The company hopes for formal mediation.</p>
<p>From the Transportation Committee side, Chai Zifei provided the following explanation: (1) The Shanghai-Minhang Company's contract is incomplete. (2) The CaoBao Road land price has not been finalized, and the road rights cannot be determined. (3) The local intention is to use the traffic surplus for local public welfare. (4) The local side does not deny the Shanghai-Minhang Company's past losses. Subsequently, Zhang Rentao, the Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, expressed his views: (1) The traffic permit was not issued because the company's subsidy had not been fully paid. (2) The supplementary subsidy of 20 million+ yuan is provisionally collected because the multiple has not been confirmed by the central government. (3) Regarding the payment of the land price, the municipal government had no clear regulations in the 26th year.</p>

<h3>### Reader Consultation: Legal Inquiries</h3>
<p>Yin Bingsan asks: I am a businessman. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], due to financial difficulties, I mortgaged 2,060 shi of wheat to the Bao Ying Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank for 13,400 yuan, with a one-month term. Later, due to the extraordinary times, I was unable to repay on time. To maintain my credit, I added 355 dan of wheat and 750 yuan (with a receipt). The following spring, the bank transported all the mortgaged goods of all customers. Now the bank has resumed operations in Bao Ying. Can I, according to legal procedures and banking regulations, settle this matter with the bank?</p>
<p>[Attorney Mi Xitong answers:] You should study the clauses and regulations stated in the mortgage agreement with the Farmers Bank at the time of the mortgage.</p>
<h3>Delayed Marriage Arrangement</h3>
<p>Tang Dihua asks: My girlfriend, Miss Jia, got engaged to Mr. Yi at the age of eighteen. Mr. Yi is suspicious and fears that Miss Jia is having an affair, so he often tests her. Later, the War of Resistance broke out, and Mr. Yi disappeared. After the victory, Mr. Yi sent a letter to Miss Jia, but after Miss Jia replied, he disappeared again. Now I have several questions to ask: (1) Jia and Yi have been engaged for ten years. The woman's youth is fading due to adherence to the marriage agreement, but Mr. Yi continues to delay. What procedures should be followed to terminate the engagement? (2) If the woman proposes to terminate the engagement, should she be liable for compensation to Mr. Yi? (3) If the woman cannot give a written notice, is it effective to publish a notice of termination of the engagement in the newspaper? (4) If the woman legally terminates the engagement, what legal methods can be used to deal with Mr. Yi if he deliberately harasses her?</p>
<p>[Attorney Mi Xitong answers:] (1) You should ask a lawyer to legally terminate it. (2) The party without fault can request compensation from the party at fault for the damages suffered as a result. This is the provision of Article 977 of the Civil Code. (3) There is no regulation that legally publishing a notice in the newspaper is effective. It is best to publish it in three local newspapers. (4) If the termination is legal, Mr. Yi must not deliberately harass her, otherwise, Mr. Yi will violate criminal law.</p>

<h3>National Mongolian-Tibetan College to be Reorganized and Established in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] The Ministry of Education plans to convert the National Beiping Mongolian-Tibetan School into a National Mongolian-Tibetan College, and has made a record of it today. However, this plan can only be realized after the Mongolian-Tibetan School is thoroughly enriched and reorganized. It is learned that the Mongolian-Tibetan School was founded in the second year of the Republic [1913]. At the beginning of the victory, it was taken over by the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission. Recently, it was ordered by the Executive Yuan to be transferred to the Ministry of Education, and Chen Kefu was appointed as the principal. Mr. Chen has already come to Beiping to take office. Currently, the school is of a secondary school nature, with six junior and senior high school classes, and a preliminary class is set up for students from Mongolia and Tibet who come to Beiping for the first time. There are 333 students in total, including 215 Mongolian students, 18 Tibetan students, and 100 Han students. Girls account for less than two-tenths of the entire school, a total of 60 people, including 35 Mongolian students, 2 Tibetan students, and the rest are Han students. Most of the Mongolian and Tibetan children are sent by Mongolian and Tibetan nobles. Among them, three Tibetan students are from Lhasa, sent by the office in Tibet from afar. The Han students are children of border affairs personnel, or those who aspire to the border areas. The curriculum, in addition to Mongolian, Tibetan, and Mongolian-Tibetan history and geography, is no different from ordinary secondary schools. However, in order to accommodate border youths, the standards are slightly lower. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has stipulated that the number of Mongolian and Tibetan students receiving public funding is 100. Recently, many students from the border areas have sought education, reaching 230 people, so there is quite a problem of too many monks and too little porridge. In order to provide border youths with advanced study opportunities and cultivate border cadres, the Ministry of Education plans to convert the school into a Mongolian-Tibetan College with a specialized nature in the short term.</p>

President Wu especially put forward the school motto: "Wealth and rank cannot corrupt, power and force cannot subdue, poverty and lowliness cannot move," as the traditional spirit of Jiaotong University for 50 years, hoping to maintain it forever.</p>
<p>Dong Xifan Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Then, Dong Xifan of the Ministry of Education delivered a speech, stating that the progress of Jiaotong University over the years is organic and is in constant growth. The development of Jiaotong University over the past 50 years can represent the development of China, and the progress of Jiaotong University is a symbol of the progress of China.</p>
<p>Ling Hongxun Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Ling Hongxun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications, delivered a speech, saying that both the Ministry of Communications and Jiaotong University have a long history and hope to cooperate closely in the future. He also said that the most important thing after the great war is reconstruction, and the revival of transportation is undoubtedly above all else. He hopes that Jiaotong University will meet the needs of the trend and serve as the vanguard of transportation industry thinking!</p>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, praised that among the universities in the country that can be integrated with national undertakings, only Jiaotong University! After a long period of resistance and fire, the four characters "Jiaotong University" can still stand alone, which symbolizes that China will eventually live forever. During my reception of the Northeast, I deeply felt the lack of talent. I hope that the students of Jiaotong University will serve the society with the spirit of one person resisting three!</p>
<p>Wu Guozhen Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Guozhen also delivered a speech, stating that today, celebrating the 51st anniversary of Jiaotong University, recalling the dark history of China in the early years of the school, we must bitterly scold the previous generation for their unfinished responsibilities. Knowing the mistakes of the previous generation and working hard ourselves, then China can still be saved. What we fear is that our generation will be scolded by you in the future, and even you will let the next generation scold, then China will never have hope. Why is the country getting worse and worse? - Because there is no stability. Years of war and chaos make it impossible to talk about progress. Therefore, if young people want to make progress, they must first seek national stability. I hope that the students of Jiaotong University will inherit its traditional spirit and work hard in their own positions, enriching their own knowledge through research, and becoming the starting point for the construction and development of China tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the Basketball Court</h3>
<p>The Mayor's Cup basketball tournament opened last night. The US Navy Columbia and the All-Stars faced the Hua team Green Forest and Peer. The Municipal Gymnasium was only 40-50% full.</p>
<p>The All-Stars' game against Peer revealed their true strength for the first time. Although they are only a mid-level team, they excel in quick movements and seamless teamwork, but their shooting is not accurate. Only Luo Kasi is somewhat satisfactory. Their defense is also not tight. Their four-point victory over Peer was entirely due to their dominance under the basket.</p>
<p>Green Forest is the runner-up of Group A2 in this year's Basketball League. Columbia has received good reviews in several friendly matches against the Oil Team, Hualian, and Renyu. They are a team whose defense is better than their offense. Only center Ash is agile and a good shooter. Last night, Green Forest failed to stop Ash's activity in the first half, falling behind by five points.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Green Forest switched to an offensive strategy, but their fast passes and attacks were ineffective. They then switched to a slow attack, seeking opportunities to find openings and shooting near the basket, gradually narrowing the gap to a score of 26-20. However, due to the disparity in height, Green Forest had good coordination in reaching out and intercepting the ball during their offense, but when the ball was under their own basket, Columbia won it eight or nine times out of ten. Green Forest's Shu Jiayi performed well. The whole team tried their best, but the lack of experience and psychological factors had a negative impact when stepping onto the big stage for the first time. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>Minister Yu of Finance Hosts Press Conference; Elucidates Fiscal and Financial Issues; Strives for Popularization in Selling US Dollar Bonds, Absolutely No Apportionment; Relevant Parties Will Surely Curb Rising Prices in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Minister Yu of Finance hosted a press conference for the local press at 3 p.m. yesterday at the Minister of Finance's office in the Jianghai Customs Building on the Bund. He provided extensive answers to various financial and economic questions raised. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding US dollar bonds: (A) Regarding the promotion of the new bond sales, he believes that the purpose of this bond issuance is to absorb idle funds, so the issuance should strive for popularity and openness, penetrating into various regions and levels of society. In particular, the premise of free subscription must be strictly adhered to, and no apportionment will be imposed. (B) The government's issuance of bonds in US dollars is not a new creation; there is precedent for this. The purpose is simply to bring back legal currency, stabilize finance, and balance prices, with no other intention. (C) Because of various conditions, the bonds issued this time are extremely unusual. The fund guarantee is also extremely strong, and the powers of the Fund Supervisory Committee are independent. For example, the foreign exchange fund guaranteeing US dollar bonds must be allocated to the Fund Supervisory Committee for safekeeping six months before the US dollar bonds mature for repayment. In addition, if state-owned enterprises guaranteeing short-term treasury bills are sold, the proceeds from the sale must be transferred to the Fund Supervisory Committee for safekeeping. Therefore, the creditworthiness is solid, and it is believed that the promotion will be smooth. (D) The bonds will be sold in installments on a monthly average basis, and there is no intention to achieve results overnight. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the fact that the total amount of savings deposits in banks and firms nationwide is only several hundred billion yuan, and how it will be able to underwrite such a large amount of bonds. (E) Regarding the use of the bonds, the government is willing to consider anything that can help the government achieve the purpose of issuing public bonds. (F) The bonds will be considered for listing after the official bonds are printed.</p>
<p>The Government Will Surely Maintain Creditworthiness</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the handling of old debts, he believes that the government can effectively fulfill its obligations to repay various old debts issued before and during the war, without delay. This has been the case in the past, and it will be the same now and in the future. The government's bond measures always aim to take into account the interests of the state and the people, in order to maintain creditworthiness.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the repayment of bank deposits from before the war, he said that this matter is currently being carefully studied by the Supreme National Defense Council. This matter must take into account the rights and interests of both creditors and debtors, so it must be considered carefully. Once the method is approved, it will be announced immediately.</p>
<p>Rectify the Tax System and Balance Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the opening of new tax sources and the levying of special business tax, he said that the Ministry of Finance is currently promoting tax administration, focusing on adjusting the tax system, simplifying institutions, and rectifying the conduct of tax officials. Therefore, rather than calling it opening up new tax sources, it is better to call it reorganizing old taxes and levies. As for the Special Business Tax Regulations, they have been drafted and are awaiting the completion of the legislative process before being implemented.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding this year's government revenue and expenditure budget, which is slightly larger than in previous years, he believes that since the implementation of the new Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the government has been reorganizing tax revenue on the one hand and actively cutting expenditures on the other. All unnecessary expenditures have been temporarily suspended. On the revenue side, as a result of the reorganization of the tax system, based on the tax revenue situation in the past few months, this year's tax revenue will definitely be greater than expected. At the same time, the government will also use material policies to sell surplus materials at home and abroad, and speed up the disposal of enemy and puppet industries, distribute state-owned production enterprises to private ownership, issue new bonds, and receive compensation from Japan, all of which are huge sources of income for the government. Therefore, with the cooperation of various financial and economic policies, the government's revenue and expenditure will gradually achieve balance.</p>
<p>(6) He declined to comment on the US $500 million in new loans from the United States, as it was not yet time to disclose any opinions.</p>
<p>(7) The recent rise in the prices of rice, cooking oil, and cloth is being closely monitored by relevant parties, and effective measures will be taken to curb it.</p>
<p>Maintain the Direction and Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>(8) Regarding how the government will maintain a balance of revenue and expenditure while the domestic war continues, he said that while the government continues to strive for peace, it will further seek various methods in economic policies, based on recent central decisions, to stabilize the economy and finance. Our country has suffered frequent wars and overcome countless difficulties. We hope that we can endure this once again, adhere to our beliefs, maintain our direction, and then the difficulties will not be difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>(9) Any government, when implementing foreign exchange management policies, will inevitably also manage import trade. However, the government will provide as much foreign exchange as possible for essential industrial inputs. The government currently has sufficient foreign exchange funds to supply the foreign exchange needed for essential imports.</p>
<p>Manage Securities Trading to Promote Development</p>
<p>(10) Regarding whether overdue bonds will be repaid at double the value, he said that the government has not yet made a decision on this matter. (11) Regarding the business of the securities exchange, he believes that it should be strictly managed on the one hand, and it needs to be developed smoothly within the legal scope on the other hand. (12) After the establishment of the National Bank's discount committee, there are concerns that banks and firms may not be able to obtain equal benefits due to the different sizes of their capital and business scope. He said that this is a matter for the banks and firms themselves, and the authorities cannot mediate. The authorities' discount guidelines for the banks and firms do not differentiate between large and small banks.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bond Fund Supervisory Committee Established; Li Fusun Elected Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The inaugural meeting of the Fund Supervisory Committee for the 36th Year Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds was held at noon yesterday in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank. Minister Yu of Finance personally attended and presided over the meeting. Committee members present included Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Bingzhang, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiqing, Li Fusun, Ouyang Lun, Shen Rixin, Xu Yongzuo, Qin Runqing, Wu Rencang, Li Guangqian (represented by Chen Weilong), Zai Kangpei, and Yang Mianzhong. Minister Yu first gave a speech, stating: "Today is the inaugural meeting of the Fund Supervisory Committee for the 36th Year Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds. The government is establishing this committee to demonstrate its great credibility. The powers of the supervisory committee are particularly important. According to the organizational rules, the Fund Supervisory Committee has the right to independently exercise its powers within the scope of supervision. And before all the interest is paid off, its supervisory powers cannot be changed. Therefore, the supervisory committee has been granted special powers by the government to consolidate government creditworthiness and protect the rights and interests of bondholders. The supervisory committee, in handling the fund and exercising its powers, I believe will be able to be absolutely open and practical, and truly meet the expectations of the government and the people."</p>
<p>Next, President Zhang of the National Bank gave a speech, stating: "The government's issuance of bonds this time is truly a major touchstone. This can test whether the people have faith in national bonds. The National Bank will manage the bond fund in accordance with the regulations of the Fund Supervisory Committee."</p>
<p>Then, Li Fusun gave a speech, stating: "In recent years, the people have eagerly hoped to cooperate with the government. Now the government is issuing new bonds, indicating its determination to start anew with the people. Since it has been stipulated that certain assets and foreign exchange funds will be used as collateral for the bonds, it is hoped that a detailed list of the collateral will be sent to the Fund Supervisory Committee for record."</p>
<p>Finally, Li Fusun, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Wu Rencang, and Chen Bingzhang were elected as standing committee members of the Fund Supervisory Committee, and Li Fusun was publicly elected as chairman. The meeting adjourned at 1 p.m. After the meeting, Minister Yu and President Zhang jointly hosted a banquet for all members of the Fund Supervisory Committee and the Sales Committee at the Cathay Hotel, which ended happily around 2 p.m.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Standing Committee of the Fund Supervisory Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at the National Bank at 4 p.m. today. At that time, the organizational rules of the Fund Supervisory Committee and detailed rules of procedure will be discussed.</p>

Zhongzhi Oil Mill, based on a soybean price of 91,000 yuan, has a cost of 393,500 yuan. (2) Sesame oil: Private oil mills, based on the Shanghai sesame market price, have a cost of 411,000 yuan. Zhongzhi Oil Mill, based on the wholesale price in the production area, has a cost of 383,300 yuan. (3) Peanut oil: Private oil mills, based on the Shanghai peanut market price, have a cost of 465,000 yuan. Zhongzhi Oil Mill, based on the Qingdao peanut wholesale price, has a cost of 384,500 yuan. Section Chief Ji also instructed the manufacturers to collect all relevant evidence and send it to the Social Affairs Bureau before 12 p.m. today for compilation and provision to the general meeting. All manufacturers hope that the price negotiation will be flexible and not rigidly stipulated.</p>
<p>Rice</p>
<p>The group was also chaired by Section Chief Ji. Attending rice merchants reported market prices in the production areas and exchanged opinions. It was decided to collect data and calculate costs to provide the general meeting as a price negotiation standard.</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>The group was chaired by Section Chief Shao. Sugar merchants and South Goods businesses present all hoped that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation could increase the supply quantity without interruption. Regarding prices, because the price of local sugar in other cities is higher than that in Shanghai, the impact is that incoming goods are scarce. Moreover, exports have now expanded to Lanzhou, Northeast China, and other places, while the Shanghai price decision was made between September and October last year and has not been changed since then. Given the current situation, it may be appropriate to make adjustments, which will be decided at the general meeting on the 10th.</p>

The remaining 1.68 billion yuan will be distributed equally to the company's old shareholders, with each old share receiving 8 bonus shares.</p>
<h3>Increased Buying Interest from Northern Traders; Chinese Stocks Continue to Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the buying interest from young traders of the Northern faction and others increased. Yong yarn continued to improve. After most of the profit-taking bulls exited Meiya, it appeared relaxed, and as the settlement date approached, there were frequent small transactions in between. Except for Yong yarn deliberately being lowered in the morning, all others were higher. Near noon, selling from numbers 218, 213, 145, 231, 89, and 4 caused a fallback to 2,800 yuan and change. Before closing, the steady support from numbers 198 and 155 maintained stability. Bids after closing continued to rise. As a result, Yong yarn, Xinhe, and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya and Xinhua fell by less than half a percentage point, Qinheng and Xinguang were flat, and Zhongfa rose by more than half a percentage point compared to the previous close. In deferred delivery, Yong yarn, Xinhe, and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya fell slightly, and Huafeng was flat. Among the cold stocks, Tongyi, Datong, and Cement rose by half a percentage point, and the remaining ones had mixed fortunes.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, numbers 235, 198, 97, 185, 179, and 95 were successively sold. After the opening of deferred Yong yarn, it gradually decreased to below 2,760 yuan. Numbers 61, 117, and 223 took advantage of the low to maintain support, enabling it to stabilize. Then, due to the frequent activity of number 152, there were occasional inversions of spot and deferred prices, gradually becoming stable. Later, numbers 35, 94, 99, 226, 89, 4, 198, and 152 jointly absorbed, gradually pushing it up to 2,870 yuan. Xinhe and Meiya also rebounded. Numbers 97, 85, and 77 sold at high prices, causing a slight decline. As a result, Qinheng was flat compared to the previous close, Meiya, Xinguang, and Xinhua fell slightly, Yong yarn, Huafeng, and Xinhe rose slightly, and Zhongfa rose by slightly less than 10%. In deferred delivery, Yong yarn and Xinhe rose slightly, Meiya and Xinguang fell slightly, Huafeng was flat, and among the cold stocks, Yonggong rose by 10%, Cement, Tongyi, and Datong each rose by half a percentage point, Rongfeng Matches fell slightly, Guohuo Xinya was still flat, and the remaining ones rose slightly. The prices of various stocks outside the market continued to rise.</p>
<h3>Bond Sales Proceed Smoothly; Exceeds US$10 Million; President Zhang Hires Experts to Form Design Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] According to reports from those in charge of various agencies involved in the sale of 36th Year Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds, the total amount has reached US$12.2 million as of yesterday. Among them, public bonds account for US$5.7 million and treasury bills account for US$6.3 million. In addition, various agencies have sold several thousand US dollars through retail sales, and sporadic sales by various commercial banks are also not small. It is understood that among those who subscribed from the National Bank, China and Communications Bank each subscribed for US$3 million, Agricultural Bank subscribed for US$2 million, and China Trust Bureau subscribed for US$1 million. Among commercial banks, Zhejiang Industrial Bank subscribed for US$1 million and Shanghai Bank subscribed for US$1 million.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sales Committee has not yet completed its internal organization due to time constraints. It is reported that it has been decided to establish four groups under the Secretary-General: General Affairs, Sales, Statistics, and Propaganda. The General Affairs and Propaganda groups will begin operations today.</p>
<p>No Public Auction During Promotion Period</p>
<p>[Another Report] In order to promote bond sales, the Central Bank hired 19 experts yesterday to form a design committee. Vice President Chen Jian'an was appointed as the convener. Diao Minren from the Joint Treasury, Wang Zishuang, Li Tisheng, Chen Yanzuo, Gao Fang, and Wu Zhitou from the Central Bank, Xu Guangchi, Cai Gongchun, Pan Jiufen, Shi Jiujing, and Lin Xuru from the Bank of China, Li Daonan, Zhuang Shuhou, and Zhu Tongjiu from the Communications Bank, Li Renzai from the Farmers Bank, Wang Botian and Zhou Jiyao from the China Trust Bureau, and Gu Chunfan from the Postal Savings Bureau were appointed as committee members. The first meeting was held at 10 a.m. yesterday on the third floor of the Central Bank. Vice President Chen chaired the meeting and discussed the following three points: (1) strengthening bond sales, (2) target audience for sales, and (3) sales techniques. The meeting adjourned at 12 p.m. Someone raised the question of whether the bonds should be auctioned on the exchange. After repeated discussions, it was concluded that since the bond sales were proceeding smoothly, there was no need to open an auction. Moreover, at the beginning of the issuance, the people may not fully understand the benefits of the bonds, and it is not appropriate to open an auction at this time. After deliberation, it was decided to postpone the auction.</p>
<p>Preparation for Using Bonds as Reserve</p>
<p>It is understood that the Central Bank has agreed to the request of commercial banks in Shanghai to use bonds to pay up to 50% of their deposit reserve requirements with the National Bank, as stipulated in the US Dollar Bond Regulations that bonds can be used for guarantee reserves.</p>
<h3>Regarding Daily Price Fluctuations, Commander Xuan Issues Statement: Rising Prices Impact Security, Garrison Command to Take Action</h3>
<p>Our Central News Agency reporter, noting the significant impact of price fluctuations on people's livelihoods and public security, made a special visit yesterday afternoon to Commander Xuan Tiewu of the Garrison Command to inquire about his views and whether measures would be taken to stabilize prices. Commander Xuan stated: Since the Economic Supervisory Group concluded its work, economic investigation efforts have continued secretly, primarily focusing on investigation and not directly addressing price issues. However, considering the recent situation, if rising prices affect the stability of public security, the Garrison Command will directly intervene. In addition to already ordering personnel from the "Economic Investigation Network" in various locations to investigate and prosecute those with evidence of speculation and manipulation, Commander Xuan also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM yesterday, hoping to persuade various industries not to raise prices arbitrarily and to immediately level out the prices that have been raised in recent days. The original letter stated:</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urging No Price Hikes</p>
<p>"It has been observed that prices in our city have been fluctuating again in recent days, and since yesterday, there has been a general upward trend. This not only poses a significant threat to ordinary people, but also places unbearable pressure on the livelihoods of military and police personnel. The repercussions will lead to those responsible for maintaining public security being unable to sustain their duties. The detrimental consequences caused by a few speculative merchants will be unimaginable. Witnessing this crisis, this Command cannot bear to see the security of Songhu undermined by speculative merchants. Therefore, this letter urges your esteemed Chamber to instruct all industries not to arbitrarily raise prices under the pretext of supply and demand. The prices that have been raised in recent days should be immediately leveled out to appease the public and reassure the community. We earnestly hope for your cooperation."</p>
<p>Speculative Mentality Resurfaces</p>
<p>After receiving Commander Xuan's letter, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded it to various trade associations on the same day, instructing all members to strictly comply and warning them "not to act rashly or test the law." According to Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the main reason for the recent price fluctuations is the resurgence of speculative mentality, which is an unreasonable phenomenon. The government is soon to issue US dollar bonds, and those with floating capital can certainly invest in purchasing these bonds, which would benefit both the country and themselves. To hoard goods as a means of making profit, only to face severe legal sanctions, is unwise. He predicts that after the release of Commander Xuan's letter, prices may return to stability within a day or two.</p>
<p>Zheng Jiemin Stays in Shanghai to Monitor</p>
<p>General Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the National Defense Ministry, came to Shanghai on official business last week and was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing last night. However, due to the rising price trends in the city, he temporarily halted his departure and decided to stay in Shanghai to find ways to stabilize prices. General Zheng has already issued orders to the economic investigation network yesterday, intensifying their monitoring of the market. He has declared that any unscrupulous merchants found manipulating prices or monopolizing the market will be severely punished. The supply of rice has decreased, and rice merchants, constrained by price limits, are not selling goods, creating a rather serious situation. The economic inspection authorities are closely monitoring this situation. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Economic Section of the police received a confidential report from Commander Xuan regarding the hoarding of rice and ordered an immediate investigation. Chief Xu immediately dispatched officers to investigate 5011 Fuyou Road, based on the confidential report, where a large quantity of rice was suspected to be hidden. The investigation confirmed the presence of over 120 bags of rice. However, the wife of Ren Zuoqing, the owner of the premises, evaded responsibility, denying ownership of the goods. Police officers further learned that Ren Zuoqing frequently visited Yixing Company at No. 1 Tongde Lane. After a discreet investigation at that address, Ren Zuoqing was located. According to Ren, the rice did not belong to him but was stored there by his friend Zhang Zhuming. Zhang Zhuming, who resides at No. 14 Fuyou Fang, Fuyou Road, is in the business of importing and exporting straw hat materials. After questioning by the police, Zhang claimed that he had purchased the rice some time ago and had no intention of hoarding it. The police ordered Zhang Zhuming and Ren Zuoqing to post bail, and the case has been submitted to the Garrison Command for handling.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Mobilizes to Thoroughly Investigate Unscrupulous Merchants</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the recent surge in commodity prices is unreasonable. As the bureau responsible for managing commodity prices in the city, it has an unshirkable duty to stabilize prices and has decided to mobilize all staff members of the Property Rights Management Section for a thorough investigation. If any unscrupulous merchants are found manipulating prices, regardless of their identity or background, they will be brought to justice without leniency. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the price of rice in the city is affected by the production areas, and the high prices in the production areas are due to large-scale purchases for transportation to the north. Fluctuations in oil prices are also due to exports to Hong Kong and other places in the south. The city is allocated 8,000 tons of soybeans for oil extraction, which should be sufficient for self-sufficiency. However, due to exports to foreign countries in the south, foreign exchange is earned to purchase luxury goods, which are then smuggled back into the country. The director has already met with Mayor Wu to request that measures be taken to stop this practice immediately. The transshipment of edible oil was not originally restricted by the Executive Yuan, but due to the current needs, Mayor Wu is requested to petition the Executive Yuan to ban the transshipment of edible oil. If these two loopholes can be closed, it is believed that the price surge can be curbed. The Social Affairs Bureau is prepared to sell rice at any time when necessary. Mayor Wu has also requested the Ministry of Food to allocate 50,000 tons of rice to the city, which has been approved.</p>

<h3>Japan Under Control (III)</h3>
<p>— Chen Xunyü</p>
<p>Military Occupation and Repatriation of Prisoners of War (Part 1)</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Instrument of Surrender on the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945, General MacArthur, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, issued General Order No. 1, instructing Japanese forces in various regions to surrender to the following Allied commanders:</p>
<p>(1) All Japanese forces in China (excluding Manchuria), Taiwan, and Vietnam north of 16 degrees North latitude (including all land, sea, air, and support units) shall surrender to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Supreme Commander of China.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese forces in Manchuria, Korea north of 38 degrees North latitude, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands shall surrender to the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Far East.</p>
<p>(3) Japanese forces in the Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, Burma, Siam, and Vietnam south of 16 degrees North latitude, Malaya, Sumatra, Java, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Ceylon, Ambon, Kai, Aru, Tanimbar, and the Arafura Islands, and the islands of Dutch New Guinea shall surrender to the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia Command.</p>
<p>(4) Japanese forces in British Borneo, British New Guinea, Bismarck, and the Solomon Islands shall surrender to the Supreme Commander of the Australian Army.</p>
<p>(5) Japanese forces in the Japanese-mandated islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and other Pacific islands shall surrender to the Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet.</p>
<p>(6) Japanese forces in the Japanese mainland and its adjacent small islands, Korea south of 38 degrees North latitude, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Philippine Islands shall surrender to the Commander-in-Chief of the US Army Forces in the Pacific. In total, these regions contained approximately 7 million Japanese soldiers. They were to be completely disarmed, and ships, weapons, and ammunition were to be preserved as is and handed over to the aforementioned Allied commanders.</p>
<p>The advance units of the US Army began to enter Japan on August 28, 1945. On August 30, General MacArthur arrived in Tokyo. The US Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Eichelberger, immediately established its headquarters in Tokyo, garrisoning the main areas east of Hamamatsu to Hokkaido. The Sixth Army, led by Lieutenant General Krueger, established its headquarters in Kyoto, garrisoning the key areas west of Hamamatsu and Kyushu. In addition, the US Far East Air Forces, led by Lieutenant General Whitehead, and the Navy, led by Vice Admiral Griffin, Commander of the Far East Fleet, entered various naval ports. The total strength reached 400,000 men. The garrison areas of the Army and Navy at that time were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Under the Eighth Army: (A) The Tenth Corps stationed in Yokohama; (B) The Fourteenth Corps stationed in Sendai; (C) The Ninth Corps stationed in Etajima.</p>
<p>(2) Under the Sixth Army: (A) The Fifth Amphibious Force stationed in Sasebo; (B) The Second Marine Division stationed in Nagasaki; (C) The Fifth Marine Division stationed in Sasebo; (D) The First Corps stationed in Osaka; (E) The Twenty-Fourth Corps stationed in Kyoto.</p>
<p>Later, on January 31, 1946, General MacArthur announced the conclusion of an agreement with the United Kingdom for British troops to enter Japan. British troops, led by Commander Brian, began to enter Japan in February. After the British troops entered, the US occupation forces felt that their numbers were excessive and transferred the entire Sixth Army back in April. The garrison areas of the various occupation forces were also adjusted once. (See table below)</p>
<p>Since the Allied forces occupied Japan, their primary task was to destroy the foundation of Japan's war-making capabilities and concentrate all efforts on the repatriation of Japanese soldiers. Under the guidance and supervision of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the Japanese government established the "Bureau for Liaison with the Termination of War" on August 26, 1945. It comprised four departments: Political, Economic, Construction, and Repatriation. Katsuo Okazaki, Director of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was appointed as the Director of the Bureau. Later, Kenketsu Kodama succeeded him as President and reorganized it into six departments: (1) General Affairs, (2) Political, Military, Public Security, and Cultural Education, (3) Finance and Banking, (4) Land, Sea, and Air Transportation and Communications, (5) Army Reorganization, (6) Repatriation of Foreign Residents in Japan. Subsequently, Kodama was placed on the purge list and dismissed by order of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. Shigeru Yoshida, the former Foreign Minister, took over. This was the third reorganization, after which it was divided into only five departments: Political, Economic, Transportation, Construction, and Management. In addition, Japan established eight local liaison offices in accordance with its administrative divisions.</p>
<p>On October 15, 1945, the disarmament of Japan was completed under the guidance of the Allied Headquarters. At that time, General MacArthur announced the details of the dissolution of the Japanese army in a broadcast speech to the world. On August 23, the Japanese Supreme War Guidance Council was abolished. On September 13, the Japanese Army and Navy General Headquarters were abolished. On October 15, the General Staff and Naval General Staff of the Japanese Army and Navy were abolished. On November 30, the Japanese Army and Navy Ministries were abolished. On December 1, the First Demobilization Ministry and the Second Demobilization Ministry were formally established, the former responsible for the demobilization of the Army, and the latter responsible for the demobilization of the Navy. On April 1, 1946, the Demobilization Ministries were also abolished, and a Demobilization Agency was established within the Cabinet, headed by former Foreign Minister Shigeru Yoshida. The Demobilization Agency had a First Demobilization Bureau (responsible for Army demobilization) and a Second Demobilization Bureau (responsible for Navy demobilization). On October 1, the Army Officer School and other similar military schools were abolished. On October 10, operational units, such as the Combined Fleet Headquarters, were abolished. Other organizations and laws, such as the National Volunteer Corps (August 20), the Conscription Law (October 17), and the First Department of the Cabinet Information Bureau, which specialized in Army and Navy intelligence work, were also abolished one after another.</p>
<p>In his broadcast speech, General MacArthur also announced to the world that the four million invading Japanese troops within the Japanese mainland had been completely disarmed, including 57 army divisions with 2.5 million men, 1.2 million men in the navy, including 200,000 airmen in the army and navy.</p>
<p>Thus, the Japanese military organization, which had been established since January 17, the first year of Meiji (1868), for 77 years, was declared completely dissolved.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Train Has Started (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Chen Guyuan</p>
<p>The regulations for the elections of various special units are indeed in compliance with the instructions of the Constitution, and the main purpose of these regulations in the Constitution is none other than to protect the weaker parties in the elections. In the election of representatives to the National Assembly, 168 representatives are elected by women's organizations, and each county or city with a population exceeding 500,000 will elect one additional representative for every additional 500,000 people, and among these additional representatives, there will be one female representative; among the 450 vocational representatives, there are 72 female representatives. In addition to the allocation of female representative quotas in other special elections, this accounts for a total of 10%. In the election of legislators, regardless of the type of election, there is one female representative for every ten or fewer legislators, and one female representative should be elected for every additional ten, which is also close to 10%. In the election of supervisors, each province has five representatives, one of whom must be a woman. No other explicit regulations have been made for other electoral districts or units, but although it is not 20%, it is even closer to it. In addition, the nomination of female candidates only requires 200 signatures in the case of legislators, a ratio of one to fifteen compared to men; in the case of supervisors, there is no limit to the number of signatures required. At the same time, since women's votes are calculated separately, if the required number of female representatives is not met, or if there are no female candidates running, or if a vacancy occurs after the election and there are no female alternates, the vacancy will be left unfilled, which can be considered as doing everything possible to protect the weaker parties in the election. Some in the women's community may hope that 20% should be the starting point across the board, gradually reaching 50% before it can be considered fair, but I hope that future election laws will no longer have special provisions for women, which would be ideal. Because by then, women and men will compete equally and with confidence, and the women's community will no longer want such provisions.</p>
<p>There is considerable theory behind vocational elections in political science, but they are used to replace regional elections, not to coexist with them; and they must belong to special political organizations, which cannot be adopted by modern general democratic countries. Since the Constitution lists vocational representatives, everyone should abide by it, but the number is authorized by law. Since the number of representatives to the National Assembly is large and they do not directly interfere with practical politics on a regular basis, it is acceptable to maintain 450 representatives, about one-sixth, in response to the demands of vocational groups. However, since the total number of legislators cannot be too large, the number of representatives elected by provinces and special municipalities stipulated in the Constitution is nearly 600, and the number of representatives elected by Mongolians, Tibetans, overseas Chinese, and indigenous peoples totals 57, so the number of legislators elected by vocational groups cannot be increased, which is one reason. At the same time, legislative affairs should take into account the interests of the entire people. If the number of legislators in vocational fields is high, it is very likely to affect the mission of legislation. For example, if the majority of legislators are capitalists, then laws to regulate capital and support labor will be very difficult to pass. Moreover, the organization of existing vocational groups is not yet widespread, and the number of members in some cases is as few as several hundred. Regional elections can produce one legislator for every million people, so if the number of legislators from vocational groups is large, it would be extremely unfair. Regional elections are not elections for unemployed groups. Members of vocational groups can rely on their various excellent conditions to engage in activities in the regional sphere, and allow the agricultural and industrial sectors to occupy more of the quotas allocated by vocational groups, so as not to lose the original intention of establishing a separate electoral unit for vocational groups, which should still be to protect the weaker parties in the election.</p>
<p>(3) Want Equality, Want Freedom, and Want Openness</p>
<p>Everyone has a profession, but not everyone needs to join a vocational group, and members who join vocational groups all have a residential area. At the same time, some people join two vocational groups, and some people establish a secondary domicile outside their place of origin. For the sake of equality, whether it is the election of representatives to the National Assembly or legislators, it is stipulated that each voter has only one vote. Those who have more than two votes in various elections are limited to participating in one, and the voter must declare this when registering in the voter list. The election of supervisors by overseas Chinese groups also has this restriction. Based on the same reason, a person with the right to be elected shall not register as a candidate in more than two elections. This can not only give each person with the right to be elected an equal opportunity to compete in the election, but also avoid the complicated procedures of having to resign from one of the two positions if elected in both places.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, candidates are nominated by political parties, or they register as candidates by paying a certain deposit. This is to prevent too many candidates, which would waste time creating lists and increase many meaningless and cumbersome procedures. The practice of registering as a candidate by paying a deposit is not feasible in China, and since it is a free election, there should be no restrictions on the registration of candidates in terms of money. In addition to being introduced by a certain number of voters, the nomination of candidates for representatives to the National Assembly and legislators adopts the method of party nomination. Although there are countless political parties in China today, like bamboo shoots after a rain, and it is not entirely certain whether they are truly political parties, opening this door seems excessive. However, there are not many political parties that are recognized by society. If a certain group truly has the nature of a political party, it is difficult to restrict it from putting forward candidates according to the general practice of democratic countries. At this time when the democratic train is starting, it is inevitable to create rules, and we cannot abandon it for fear of choking. The party nomination is only a demonstration in China at present, and it is not limited to the method of party nomination alone, so the proportional representation system is difficult to implement. In other words, the proportional representation system cannot be used for the majority of voters who have no party affiliation, which is the case in China today.</p>
<p>Since the main purpose of the party nomination method is to establish a system, it is necessary to adopt the method of voter signature nomination in order to meet the actual needs. To nominate a candidate by voter signature, 500 or more signatures are required in the case of representatives to the National Assembly, with each voter limited to signing for one person, which applies to all special unit elections. In the case of legislators, 3,000 or more signatures are required. However, if the candidate is from a vocational group, the number is reduced to 500 or more signatures. If the candidate is a woman, the number is reduced to 200 or more signatures. Each voter is limited to signing for one candidate. The number of signatures required for representatives to the National Assembly is smaller because there are more representatives, so there should be more candidates; and the electoral districts of counties and cities are small, so if the number of signatures is large, it would be tantamount to depriving the right of candidates to compete. The number of signatures required for legislators is larger, which is naturally due to the small number of legislators and the large electoral districts, and it is also a reason to restrict candidates from the number of signatures required, as legislators need to be talented and often elected. The number of signatures for vocational group candidates is reduced to 500 because vocational groups have fewer members and it is easier to nominate candidates. The number of signatures for female candidates is further reduced to 200 because female legislators are not elected by women's groups, but rather the female quota is allocated among various elections, so special protection is given.</p>
<p>In the case of supervisors, the nomination of each candidate only requires the signature of five or more voters in each province, city, and Mongolia and Tibet, because the provincial and municipal councils or Mongolian and Tibetan local councils sometimes have only a dozen or so members, so the number of signatures cannot be increased. In the case of elections by overseas Chinese groups, the nomination of candidates should be co-signed by 30 or more voters; in the case of elections by the representatives of each banner council of the joint electoral district before the establishment of the Mongolian local council, the nomination of candidates should be co-signed by 30 or more citizens with electoral districts outside the council. The number of signatures is still not too high. The number of signatures for female candidates is even unrestricted. In the case of the President and Vice President, candidates are nominated by 100 or more representatives to the National Assembly within the time limit determined by the Assembly, and each representative may only nominate or co-sign one decision. The reason why 100 signatures are required is to prevent frivolous people from considering it an honor to be nominated as a candidate for President or Vice President, which must be seriously restricted.</p>
<p>Incumbent officials may not be elected as representatives to the National Assembly in the electoral district where they are located. This is stipulated in Article 28, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution. Because it is of great importance, Article 8 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law makes a special provision. Article 13 of the Legislative Member Election and Recall Law adopts this intention and stipulates that incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in the electoral district where their office is located in their jurisdiction shall resign five months before the election. The purpose of this regulation is nothing more than to exclude the manipulation of special forces, so that everyone has the opportunity to compete openly. By extension, it is even more appropriate that members or supervisors and staff of the election organization should not be candidates for representatives to the National Assembly or legislators in the area or group where they handle the election. Although there are no similar provisions in the election and recall of supervisors, there is no doubt that the supervisors and staff who handle the election should not have the qualifications of candidates, and there will be supplementary regulations in the implementing regulations in the future. However, the Election and Recall Law for Supervisors stipulates that each provincial and municipal councilor elected as a supervisor is limited to one person, also to prevent manipulation by the electoral college. And so.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I would like to mention the election organization here: Originally, I wanted to set up election supervisors in various election offices according to past practice, but later, people from various parties and factions believed that the election organization should accommodate participation from all parties, so that all parties that participated in the constitution-making had the opportunity to jointly promote the election administration. Therefore, except for the Mongolia and Tibet Election Office and the election of supervisors, the organization of the election office uniformly adopts the election committee system. The reason why the election of supervisors does not use the election committee system is because the procedure is relatively simple, and a by-election must be held after the recall case is passed. It is also too difficult to organize an election committee for the by-election of one person, so the provincial and municipal administrative heads are the election supervisors. Some people advocate that the speaker of the council should be the election supervisor, but in this way, the speaker's right to be elected is implicitly deprived, which is not appropriate. The election of the President and Vice President is handled by the National Assembly according to law, and it is a presidium system rather than a speaker system, so there is no issue of election organization.</p>
<p>(4) How to be Elected? How to Fill Vacancies?</p>
<p>Whether it is a representative to the National Assembly or a legislator, they are all elected in order according to the legal number of seats, based on the number of votes obtained. According to pure theory, the plurality voting system is not without its shortcomings: it is easy to be elected, and those elected may not be what the public wants, which is one. Since the election is not by the largest majority, it cannot encourage people to vote enthusiastically, which is two. Candidates are also lazy to engage in large-scale election activities, and there is no way to cultivate the strength of political parties in the election, which is three. Therefore, some people advocate that candidates should be elected if they get more than half of the total number of votes, and if the number of votes is insufficient, another vote should be held, and then the plurality should be elected. Although this ideal is high, in China today, when universal suffrage is just beginning, the majority of the people lack the habit of voting. If the absolute majority voting system is adopted, any electoral district will inevitably have two votes, which is time-consuming and inconvenient, and is not suitable for today's situation. Not only the election of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators adopts the plurality system, but also the election of supervisors. However, the election of the President or Vice President is based on obtaining more than half of the total number of representatives' votes; if no one reaches this number of votes, the top three candidates with the most votes will be re-voted, and if there is no result, a third vote will be taken: If no one reaches this number of votes in the first vote, the top two candidates with the most votes will be voted again, and the candidate with the most votes will be elected; if the number of votes is the same, another vote must be taken and decided by the plurality. The procedure is cautious, but also cumbersome, and cannot be widely applied to the election of other candidates. As for the election of the President and Vice President, they should be held separately, first the President and then the Vice President. Whether it is an absolute majority election or a plurality election, there is no necessary connection between them. The reason why these two elections are held separately is that those who run for President and lose can still have the opportunity to be candidates for Vice President.</p>
<p>Whether it is a representative to the National Assembly or a legislator, if there is a vacancy, it will be filled by the alternate in order; the alternate is produced by electing the full number of representatives to the National Assembly or legislators according to law, and the other candidates who get votes are in order according to the number of votes, and if the number of votes is the same, it is determined by drawing lots. Some people believe that this method is not as reasonable as a by-election, and when it is carried out in parallel with the recall system, it will inevitably induce the alternate to use the recall to seek a vacancy, and to act whenever there is an opportunity, and the country will have more troubles from now on. However, by-elections must be formally held; vacancies occur from time to time, and elections are always in progress, which is ultimately not suitable for the current situation in China. However, because it does not adopt by-elections, the number of alternates is set at three when there are two or fewer elected in each electoral district or unit; when there are more than two elected, the number of alternates is the same as the number of elected, which is to prevent too few alternates and the trouble of having to hold elections again when there are no alternates to fill the vacancy. The alternate system is used only when it is unavoidable, so the by-election for the successor is adopted when a supervisor is vacant, and the date of the by-election is determined by order. The successor supervisor will serve until the original term expires. When the President is vacant or removed from office due to recall, the Vice President will succeed to the office until the original President's term expires; therefore, the Vice President is essentially a presidential candidate. When both the President and Vice President are vacant, in accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution, in addition to the President of the Executive Yuan temporarily acting in their capacity, the National Assembly will be convened for a temporary session to elect the President and Vice President, whose terms will be to make up for the unexpired term of the original President, which can also be said to be a kind of by-election.</p>
<p>(5) Prudent Use and Abuse of the Right of Recall</p>
<p>The recall system is being implemented for the first time in China. Article 133 of the Constitution only stipulates that "those who are elected may be recalled by the original electoral district according to law." It takes a lot of consideration to make effective regulations in law. We must not narrow the scope and restrict it because it is being tried out, so that the people have the name of recall but not the reality. It is also a mistake to carelessly broaden the scope and fall into abuse, so that politics is often in a state of unrest. Therefore, in the four election and recall laws, the provisions on recall must be carefully written to seek perfection.</p>
<p>According to the precedents of several countries that have adopted the recall system, those who have been in office for a short time should not be allowed to apply for recall. This is to prevent the abuse of the right of recall. In theory, it is difficult to determine whether the elected person is virtuous and competent without a considerable period of time; if a considerable period of time is not set, it would be almost child's play to elect today and recall tomorrow. Moreover, recall does not require legal reasons. Although the reasons should be stated in the recall petition, this is only to gain the sympathy of the recall voters. Even if there are no sufficient reasons objectively, the purpose can still be achieved as long as the recall case is passed. Therefore, in order to slightly restrict the temporary likes and dislikes of the recall petitioners, it is even more necessary to do so. The National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law stipulates that voters in the original electoral unit may not file a recall petition against the elected representative until six months have passed. For example, if the representatives are elected before September of this year and the meeting is held on December 25, then six months after the representatives are elected, they have already performed their duties, and they can be recalled due to their poor performance or other circumstances. But if there is no such restriction, it would be difficult for them to be representatives if they are recalled at any time after being elected without even having attended a meeting. The Legislative Member Election and Recall Law and the Supervisor Election and Recall Law have the same provisions, giving a period of six months to observe the results. The recall of the President and Vice President has a greater impact on the political situation, so representatives to the National Assembly may not apply for the recall of the President and Vice President who have been in office for less than twelve months. Some people say that although this avoids the frivolous filing of recall cases, which affects the prestige of the President and Vice President, what if the President and Vice President commit serious crimes of internal strife and foreign aggression within twelve months of taking office? It should be noted that if the President and Vice President have such behavior, the Control Yuan can file an impeachment, which is not subject to this provision. In other words, when the Control Yuan files an impeachment case against the President and Vice President with the National Assembly, the National Assembly can decide on the recall of the President and Vice President, which is not subject to the twelve-month period restriction.</p>

<h3>A DEPARTMENT STORE SALESGIRL'S DIARY</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>Our office used to be a department store. In my office drawer, there were still many receipt books left behind. In one of the receipt books, I found a diary. Opening it, the handwriting was still delicate.</p>
<p>March 3rd</p>
<p>Sitting at the counter, bored, I took out the colorful and dazzling little things one by one to play with. Looking at myself in the closed round mirror, fastening a brooch, putting on earrings, and clipping on a hair clip, I felt a bit self-pitying. Then, opening the powder boxes one by one to look at myself, Mr. Director walked over. I picked up my favorite powder box and said to him:</p>
<p>"Give it to me!"</p>
<p>"Okay, just issue a receipt!"</p>
<p>He was just saying that. If I issued a receipt, who would I ask to collect the money?</p>
<p>March 8th</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Peng said it was Women's Day. I secretly slipped out to have some refreshments across the street. After eating, we agreed that I would go first, return through the side door, and Peng would pay the bill and then return through the front door. As a result, no one knew we went out together.</p>
<p>Today, I felt a bit of spring in the air.</p>
<p>March 11th</p>
<p>I was playing with various toys in the toy department. Peng walked over. I picked up a wooden gun and aimed it at his heart. He trembled with fright; I think he was pretending.</p>
<p>March 20th</p>
<p>I went to Peng's counter to buy powder. To my surprise, Peng said the powder was not suitable for me.</p>
<p>I said, "What right does a salesperson have to refuse a customer?"</p>
<p>He said, "I'm doing it for your own good because your skin is too warm, and the powder will block your skin's breathing."</p>
<p>"My heart is very cold," I said.</p>
<p>"That's not right, because the freckles on your face prove that your heart is very warm."</p>
<p>I was very angry.</p>
<p>March 21st</p>
<p>After lunch, coming down from upstairs, I saw Mai leaning on Peng's counter, chatting and laughing. What reason did she have to be so close to Peng? She is already the mother of a ten-year-old girl. I quietly walked up to her. She was startled and embarrassedly returned to her stocking counter.</p>
<p>March 22nd</p>
<p>Peng wanted me to treat him to candy.</p>
<p>I said, "I won't, because there's no sweetness between us."</p>
<p>March 24th</p>
<p>Mai bought a raw cucumber from the food shop next door and was eating it. I thought she was too crude, but Peng seemed to like her. I really don't understand what men are thinking.</p>
<p>March 26th</p>
<p>After lunch, Mai suggested buying peanut candy to eat, and Peng agreed.</p>
<p>Eating again right after finishing lunch is unsanitary and costs money. Although I didn't agree, I had to submit to the majority. It is said that this is "democracy."</p>
<p>March 30th</p>
<p>Peng stroked Mai's hair and said, "Miss Mai's hair is combed so well, high in the front and pulled back on both sides."</p>
<p>I immediately went to the mirror to look at myself. My hair droops down on one side. I think it looks much better than Mai's hair.</p>
<p>April 1st</p>
<p>Today is the company's first anniversary. There's a week-long sale. Customers are flooding in like a tide. The sound of ringing bells and pencils tapping on the counter is chaotic. One colleague was so anxious that she was hitting the counter with an abacus. - It's extremely lively!</p>
<p>April 3rd</p>
<p>We eat in three shifts. I eat on the third shift, the time is one o'clock. Today, business was so good, the sound of ringing bells was so loud, that I was too busy to hear the meal bell. When I looked, it was already 1:20. I wondered why lunch hadn't started so late. When I asked, the third shift's lunch had already started. I was very anxious. Peng wanted to treat me to lunch, but I refused because I knew he liked Mai. In the end, Mr. Director treated me, and the dishes were very good.</p>
<p>April 5th</p>
<p>The powder box I loved was bought by a customer. When I issued that receipt, my heart ached, no, my heart was broken! After issuing the receipt, I picked up the powder box for one last look.</p>
<p>"What a beautiful powder box!" I said.</p>
<p>The customer gave a smug smile.</p>
<p>April 7th</p>
<p>A customer wanted to buy white sewing thread. I searched in the counter for a while but couldn't find it. I told her the white one was sold out. She seemed very disappointed. So I took a spool of light blue thread and asked her, "Is this okay?" She took it and looked at it, but didn't like it very much. She searched the counter herself for a while and pointed to a spool, asking me to take it out. When I looked, it was also light blue and difficult to take out. I said, "That's light blue. Take it out and see!" "Taking it out will also be blue." She insisted that I take it out. I had no choice but to follow the customer's wishes, move out all the spools of thread, and then take out the spool she pointed to and give it to her. She took it, looked at it, smiled, and gave it back to me. I was extremely angry at that moment.</p>
<p>April 8th</p>
<p>Today is Mai's birthday. She's treating us to noodles tonight.</p>
<p>After getting off work, Mai sat on Peng's bicycle and went back first. Mr. Zhao, Mr. Liu and I took the tram. The location was chosen by Mai, and we weren't familiar with it. It took us a lot of time to find it. It turned out to be a dirty and small noodle shop. It's embarrassing to say.</p>
<p>As soon as I went in, I saw Mai and Peng sitting opposite each other eating noodles, with a bright scarf on Mai’s head. I had nothing to say.</p>
<p>April 9th</p>
<p>I received a notice that I issued the wrong receipt and had to pay more than ten thousand yuan in compensation.</p>
<p>What good is the company's good business to me? There are drawbacks. I should do less business in the future! One item is divided into many item numbers and many prices. Customers' selections are overwhelming. How can I keep things clear?</p>
<p>I heard that the peach blossoms in Longhua have withered. This year's spring is over!</p>
<p>After work, Peng again asked Mai to sit on the back of his bicycle and send her back. Hmph, they're still pretending to be serious in front of me! ...</p>
<h3>AUTUMN FOREST CHIMATA (CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK) (WATERCOLOR)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shaoling</p>
<h3>BALAY ANSWER</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>James Metlew Barrie (1860), a veteran in the British drama circle, is a very witty person. Once, many people visited him and asked about the process of his work's success. He interestingly replied: A journalist is two bags of tobacco equals one hour, two hours equals one idea, one idea equals three news stories, and three news stories equals a leader. But a novelist is eight bags of tobacco equals one ounce, seven ounces equals one week, two weeks equals one chapter, twenty chapters equals one pen nib, and two pen nibs equals a novel. The great writer Galsworthy once quoted these words when lecturing on his own writing experience.</p>

<h3>WINDOW AND OTHERS</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mianzhi</p>
<p>WINDOW</p>
<p>I've been living at the end of this small suburban village for half a year now. Although the room I occupy is just one, half bedroom, half guest room, it's still a home. To reduce the temptation for passing food peddlers to give to my children, I always keep the front door tightly bolted, so the house is also deeper. On the contrary, there are very few acquaintances here, and it's rare for distant guests to come. Fortunately, there's a clear glass window, otherwise I would be even more depressed and suffocated. It is my eyes, my source of light.</p>
<p>Today, the children are napping and haven't woken up yet. There is an unusual silence in the room. It is trembling in bursts, constantly making creaking sounds.</p>
<p>The wind is blowing, still containing some sand. The fields and the sky are hazy with a turbid yellowish-brown color. The clouds are also so gray and yellow, boundless. In front, there is a continuous line of rolling hills of earth mounds, no grass can be seen. The half-covered, forked tree branches, although interspersed with a few low-lying evergreen trees, dotted in the corners of the exposed old village houses, also appear dark and blurred. Behind that, a newly built triangular ice storage house made of straw stands like a pyramid in the wind and sand.</p>
<p>I stood woodenly by the window, intentionally or unintentionally looking at these scenes. I slowly noticed the faint, swaying shadows of kites in the tree branches. They are so dashing and otherworldly, within sight but out of reach. They wove the dream of my hometown fields;</p>
<p>The wheat waves are already turning in the wind, and there are also the mating calls of pheasants among them. The broad beans are also squeezing their charming eyes, butterfly-like eyes. The wild children, under the guise of picking vegetables, escape the adults' supervision and chase each other in the fields. Some lie there, lying in the sound of the wind wheel. The wheat fields have already been weeded with hoes. On windy days, the adults mostly hide in their houses, hoping for the eighth rain in February, so the wheat fields can be nourished and there will be noodles and fish to eat. Don't you hear? The sound of the wind is roaring, the sound of the loom creaking in the houses with closed doors. Those familiar faces, one by one, appear before my eyes. My two children who lost their mother are studying in the village school. Should they be a little cold? Did they bring more clothes?...</p>
<p>A wave of sorrow. In the distance, there are still continuous rolling hills of earth mounds. I also think that there are few cheerful smiling faces in my hometown, and few complete meals. They are all wearing tattered clothes, lighting bean oil lamps at night. There are often gunshots, and it is rare to hear dogs barking. My hometown has become so thin that only bones remain. Thousands upon thousands of people have fled to other places. What kind of world is that?</p>
<p>I can't bear to think anymore. There are no more traces of vegetable vendors on the main road. Occasionally, there are those selling sugarcane or learning bird calls, their shoulders covered with wind and sand, trudging back to their temporary residences.</p>
<p>Today, the days are unusually long, every minute and every second is heavy.</p>
<p>The wind is blowing harder and harder, and my window is also creaking louder and louder. A sound of machinery whizzed by. I heavily opened the glass window, letting the wind blow in, blowing on my burning cheeks, even though the dust and sand sealed the table under my windowsill.</p>
<p>NEWSPAPER</p>
<p>Is a drifter, unable to make a living, shouldering the burden of four children, including a nursing infant. I don't know how I got through so many days before, and I'm even more at a loss as to how to spend the many days to come.</p>
<p>Even the green-clothed people appear indifferent, passing by indifferently, not coming in. The newspaper delivery man has become my only guest. I wait for him every day, like a stone thrown into a shallow, calm stream. It brings me warmth and tears, encouraging me and also deeply tormenting me. Seeing him is like family members facing each other, exchanging intimate heartfelt words. Being away from him for a day leaves me with no place to turn. Heaven, it entangles me so much, grabbing my soul and refusing to let go.</p>
<p>What I can't forget the most is the quiet rain night. Alone, I gently sat before the lamp, reverently opening the accumulated daily newspapers, page by page, clipping out the texts and woodcuts that I enjoyed reading. It was no different from the heartfelt joy of an old friend coming in the wind and rain. Of course, the sounds of civil war and the soaring prices constantly plagued me, but precisely because the tension was so intense and prolonged, any slight relaxation was particularly precious.</p>
<p>PAWN</p>
<p>When I was a child, when I read lines like "Returning from court, I pawn my spring clothes every day," I thought that the matter of pawning seemed to have some elegance to it.</p>
<p>When I haggle with pawnshop clerks with a timid heart, I feel that it is completely different from what I imagined when reading poetry.</p>
<p>Several times, I saw short-dressed heroes, in the cold weather, taking off their cotton-padded or velvet shirts. Their expressions were so calm and unrestrained. I felt that my trembling appearance was simply the behavior of a weak person. It's not good, not good!</p>
<p>Recently, calculating the value of currency, it can be said that high interest loans no longer exist. However, after running around for several times to extend the deadline and add interest, seeing the pawnshop that looks like a government office, I really have some respect and distance. Sometimes I even pretend not to see it, and quickly stare at other shops or vehicles to reduce that kind of silent threat. But thinking about the faces of relatives and friends who have ways to help, they may not be as pleasant as the clerks, so I have some longing.</p>
<h3>PREFACE TO MOURNING WENG TONGSHI</h3>
<p>— Wang Hanxian</p>
<p>It has been ten years since I parted with Weng Shanweng in the capital; two years ago, I returned east from Sichuan, and inquired about him in Shanghai, but no one knew. Later, brother Chong told me that he lived in the Heyi Village on Yongjia Road, so I hurried to visit by car, but Weng was out; so he came to see me the next day, and told me about his recent situation, saying that his wrist strength had not weakened, and his calligraphy had improved, and he wanted to wield the brush in front of everyone to express his accumulated feelings. I also planned to invite him to a banquet, but it didn't work out. After that, I rarely visited due to work, and suddenly the news of Shanweng's death arrived, and in shock and grief, I mourned him with a poem.</p>
<p>Returning east, I bitterly remember the old Shanweng, but I only knew that he made Shanghai his home; Several times I passed through Heyi Village, but my old friend was in this village</p>
<p>Happy to see old friends like new rain, meeting with sorrow and joy feels like a different world; Alas, now truly separated by worlds, Cultivating literature and answering the summons, so hurried</p>
<p>Swallows fly west, returning again now, unbearable these ten years of changing seas; How many old travels have fallen away? One old man left, a miserly act of the Creator</p>
<p>I said myself, wielding the brush, my strength is not yet painful, wanting to enjoy Qing pleasure together; How is this destiny ultimately unfulfilled, broken paper and silk, I ask if there are any</p>
<p>Love combined with teacher and friend, following closely, a bond that fits like moss and cypress, not by chance? Accompanying in the history bureau, together morning and evening, Crazy and unrestrained, stirring up mist for more than twenty years</p>
<h3>LOVE LETTER AFTER MARRIAGE</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>You accepted my invitation, and we went to the theater together. In fact, we ourselves are also playing a drama - you may not understand the content of this script very well, but I understand it from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Here is the whole truth:</p>
<p>The first summer we met, when I was still an uninhibited boy, I developed a good feeling for you. However, you had other close friends at that time, and I could only secretly extinguish the passion in my heart with tears… Later, I also met a young lady, understood each other, and got engaged. However, I still can't forget you. Recently, I learned that you and that friend have no special friendship, so every time when the night is deep and people are quiet, I often have fantasies: Do I still have the right to express my feelings to you at this moment?</p>
<p>You now understand the whole process. My words are frank and fearless. I believe that only human beings who can control their behavior with character and emotion can understand the happiness of life.</p>
<p>Emotion is lovely and terrible. It is definitely not a sin, and it cannot be restrained. However, I have decided to change this impossible love into respect for you. Because: A husband's love should all belong to his wife.</p>
<p>Goodbye! Wish you happiness.</p>
<h3>ONE INCH OF MOUNTAIN, ONE INCH OF RIVER, ONE INCH OF BLOOD</h3>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>During the Republic of China's 17th year, after the successful Northern Expedition of the National Army, on the southwest outskirts of Shanghai, there was such a group. The location was originally a large family's ancestral hall, later they themselves renamed it "Bai Ren Zhuang."</p>
<p>This small group, up until now, has only had about twenty people. It is said that the leading figure of this group is an old man in his sixties, and the whole group calls him "Old Man Juechang." Shanghai's Bai Ren Zhuang is just a temporary residence for recruiting talents. The original birthplace is still in a natural paradise on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui, in the remaining veins of West Tianmu Mountain. That is a large valley, with screens of towering cliffs on all sides, titled "Da Jue Valley."</p>
<p>This Old Man Juechang, having experienced the dangers of officialdom and the vicissitudes of the world, was unwilling to give up on himself; so he chose this deep mountain valley and implemented his "Utopian Ideal." He said that China is an agricultural country, and the most ideal way to strengthen the country is through new village education. He knew that there were not a few people with the same ideals in the same era. Apart from most of them being willing but unable to act, there were indeed a few people who implemented this ideal. However, among these people, some had incomplete plans, only telling people to take off their bare feet and go to the fields, letting leeches bite them, while they themselves wore Western-style trousers with four neatly ironed lines, taking artistic photos on the side, preparing them for fundraising advertisements. There were also some unorthodox textbooks of some sort, saying they were rural education.</p>
<p>He also knew that some people were incredibly resourceful and actually had the ability to raise a huge amount of donations from home and abroad, hiring third- or fourth-rate gilded doctors, masters, and bachelors, saying they were agricultural and forestry experts, spending the huge sums raised on improving pigs and chickens, while they themselves took those improved foreign chickens and ducks, smoked and roasted them to eat as French cuisine.</p>
<p>Old Man Juechang, however, did not use this method. He first opened an experimental new village in Da Jue Valley, counting it as one unit. In this unit, he recruited a few buried practical agricultural and forestry talents, and tried to use Western methods suitable for Chinese soil and human nature as much as possible, cultivating and raising livestock. He also sent some cultivable youths to various foreign countries to study practical subjects on site, to return and assist in development.</p>
<p>Regarding education, it was not just about recognizing a few basic characters; they used the latest educational weapons from abroad; movies, wireless radios, slide projectors, group lectures, dramas, music, etc., etc., allowing the people in this new village to absorb various new knowledge.</p>
<p>In this new village, there was only one creed: to be loyal to the country, to fulfill all the obligations that citizens should fulfill? To love humanity, to seek all the happiness that humanity should seek.</p>
<p>In addition to developing knowledge and morality in the village, Old Man Juechang especially emphasized the health of everyone's physique. For ordinary sports, both new and old, they had various gymnastics, ball games, competitions, swimming; the old ones were special; because Old Man Juechang himself was proficient in the art of nourishing life, internal and external exercises, and various martial arts. Therefore, everyone in the village, at a minimum, had practiced your family's ancestral secret editions of the Eight Brocades and the Yijin Jing. As for those with suitable physique and similar temperament, they were trained in internal and external martial arts and specialized skills according to their individual qualities, such as Chin Na hand, Damo Palm, Toad Gong, One Finger Zen, etc. There were also several particularly advanced ones who could even use "Tai Chi Zen Gong Empty Strength." …</p>
<p>"You're making it sound too good!" Seeing Zheng Yan's report, I felt strangely enlightened and extremely excited, but it seemed like I was listening to a fairy tale, and I couldn't quite believe it.</p>
<p>"No, Captain; your subordinate dares not fabricate a single word of rumor; I only regret that I can't speak clearly enough..."</p>
<h3>DUBOU MAN TALK</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>A dock worker, exhausted from labor during the day; wants to sleep peacefully at night, but in his dreams, he is still doing heavy work, and the next day he is still exhausted.</p>
<p>A person who has eaten vegetarian food for decades, if one day he suddenly has a whim and indulges in eating pork. This is proof that this person will not live long.</p>
<p>People originally follow the normal trajectory of life habits to find every peaceful and stable tomorrow. The elasticity of life cannot tolerate the collapse of ideals and practice at the same time.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think the sudden marriage of monks or nuns is more terrifying than the debauchery of playboys.</p>
<p>If human psychological complexes cannot find appropriate sublimation and are only barely suppressed; the consequences are unimaginable.</p>
<p>To pretend to be great in order to forgive others, their own sins must be unforgivable.</p>
<p>And the great souls that are regarded as floods and beasts; because of their prescience, they must suffer - this is an unavoidable law. They are nailed to the cross, forgetting the slander of the small groups and their own bleeding, but embracing a heart full of compassion; calling out to humanity the way to eternal life, seeing how the ocean of selfishness has submerged many small boats of inspiration,</p>
<p>This great misfortune is not an "expression," nor a "posture," but "truth," "goodness," "beauty," and a small drop in the world's drunkenness.</p>
<p>Forgiving enemies requires more generosity than benefiting friends.</p>
<p>Moreover, what Christ asks of us is to save our enemies!</p>
<p>"Returning evil for good" is truly an extremely difficult act.</p>
<p>Medicine is for treating patients. If you inject penicillin into the arm of a dead person, it is unnecessary. Some people like to send the dead to the funeral home for grooming. This kind of "face-saving" prank is far less interesting than burning paper money in the underworld. If you open the chest of a dead person and put in shark fins and bird's nests, even if the dead person doesn't vomit, how can the living bear it? The ways to seek fame are many.</p>
<p>Precisely because medicine cannot be recklessly given to the dead to seek healing. By the same token, "returning evil for good" has its corresponding limits; I dare not imagine some of the virtues that my countrymen call virtues. Therefore, I dare to make this argument.</p>
<p>FREE TALK</p>
<h3>Shanghai People's Wallets</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou</p>
<p>In the past half-month, Shanghai people's spring outings can be described as reaching a state of infatuation. The number of tourists in Longhua is like , and the crowding at the North Railway Station has led to news of injuries and deaths of women and children daily. The fact that Shanghai people have money in their wallets is a testament to this. When these wealthy Shanghai people go to the countryside, their lavish spending and generosity are somewhat reminiscent of the American sailors who flocked to this place from Shanghai after the end of the Pacific War. Their demeanor seems to say, "As long as you name a price, we can afford it; everything you have can be bought with money, and we can also buy everything you have!" These five large characters in quotation marks, although a jarring cliché, are enough to depict the ravenous appearance of Shanghai people in front of the villagers.</p>
<p>A foreign journalist once said, "The whole country is starving, but Shanghai is dancing." Seeing the joyous spring outings of Shanghai people in the past half-month, as well as the poverty of compatriots in the interior, it can be seen that this statement is indeed not wrong. But on the other hand, the so-called "whole country," whether in words or in reality, includes Shanghai, which is dancing. Among Shanghai's nearly four million people, more than half are struggling to survive on the brink of starvation. Therefore, if we were to change the foreign journalist's words to "Shanghai is starving, Shanghai is dancing," we wouldn't be wrong either.</p>
<p>My point is not only that some people in Shanghai are secretly starving while others are dancing, but also that the same starving person is dancing, and the same dancing person is hungry in their stomach. So, changing the above statement to "Shanghai people are starving, Shanghai people are dancing" wouldn't be wrong either. The wallets of Shanghai people on spring outings to the countryside are full, but do you know where their money comes from? Many people take one spring outing, preparing to live in darkness for a month. But knowing that the next month will be dark, they still cannot help but participate in the lively spring outing. This is the Shanghai people's "drink today's wine and be drunk today" philosophy of life. Their enjoyment is built on the brink of starvation. Villagers see Shanghai people's gorgeous clothes and extravagant behavior, assuming that they eat delicacies and live in high-rise buildings, but they don't know that they often live in attics, eat salted rice porridge, and are uncertain about their future. On the contrary, looking at the villagers, they seem to be frugal everywhere, but in fact, they are steady and grounded, living in their own three thatched cottages, wearing simple clothes and eating simple food, without having to worry every day.</p>
<p>Shanghai is like a factory described in Upton Sinclair's novel "The Jungle." The small amount of wages earned by the workers day and night is consumed in the factory's affiliated bars and gambling dens. You see how happily they indulge in these entertainment venues, but you don't know how pitiful their happiness actually is.</p>
<h3>Petition to the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>— Qian Yongfa</p>
<p>On April 1st, the Ministry of Education revised Article 2 of the three articles of the academic regulations for schools above the vocational level: "Graduates of vocational and normal schools must serve for four years before being allowed to further their education." When students of our vocational schools saw this, they didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Four years is not a short time. The Ministry of Education especially stated that they can only further their education after four years, it would be better to say frankly that students graduating from vocational schools are not allowed to further their education. If we are lucky enough to find a job and serve for four years, some of the geometry and algebra in our mind will have long been forgotten. If the Ministry of Education says, "You can work hard to review during the four years of service," then can the Ministry also definitively say, "During your service, there will definitely be enough free time for you to review the subjects for the entrance exam."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education did not explain the reason why vocational and normal schools cannot immediately further their education. I think, normal school students probably received the "grace" of the Ministry of Education's free education. But we vocational school students did not receive that kind of "grace." We also paid a large stack of tuition fees every semester, just like other schools. If the Ministry of Education says, "Your purpose of entering vocational school is to seek employment, why do you want to further your education?" This statement is originally correct, but can the Ministry of Education guarantee that students with secondary education can definitely find a job in the current depressed society? If we cannot find a job, and the Ministry of Education does not allow us to further our education, are we really supposed to be parasites at home?</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's regulations are really unreasonable. Vocational school students are neither incompetent nor clumsy. We not only have to cope with the professional courses in school, but also have to cope with the general subjects that cannot be taught in school when we further our education. Therefore, we request the Ministry of Education to abolish this unreasonable regulation, otherwise the future of our vocational school students is worrying.</p>
<h3>Moving Backwards</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>It is said that there is still no definite plan for the printing of national standard textbooks. In order to prevent further price and labor increases, and fearing that costs will increase again, it is reported that many bookstores have begun to print the old pre-war approved editions in order to supply them as autumn sales books. Whether these books are suitable for the needs of the present era is truly a question. Moving backwards with textbooks is indeed an unreasonable and bad phenomenon. (Editor's note: It is not known whether this news is true or not, we hope that the bookstores will give us an answer.)</p>
<h3>Reading "Miscellaneous Notes from a Ladderless Building"</h3>
<p>— Feichen</p>
<p>This is a piece of reportage literature that has been hammered and is full of combativeness. Under the lamp, I received the author's full and unrestrained emotions, and almost couldn't control myself!</p>
<p>Collected in this collection are a total of thirty-five articles, all of which are emotional pickings left behind by the author, Mr. Bu Shaofu, in the rear during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. Precisely because Mr. Bu Shaofu is a warrior who has dedicated himself to journalism for more than twenty years, therefore, after the hammering of emotions and the tempering of the Anti-Japanese War, the eloquent articles that he regurgitates all shimmer with emotional sparks and flaunt the author's boundless talent.</p>
<p>When I quietly read his descriptions of Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, Liuzhou, and Funing, I seem to hear the sound of his wind and waves, and I seem to see the clear and gurgling long stream. In the description of Chongqing during the "Bombing," the author writes:</p>
<p>"...After the bomb fell to the ground, it rushed up a burst of smoke and flames, a burst of sparks, and then slowly disappeared... The river water of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers flows gurglingly, the green flowers and trees sway with the color and fragrance of summer, and my emotions are immersed in this sticky, resilient, strong, durable, and obstinate atmosphere of the centipede."</p>
<p>In this short fragment, he has already painted for us how "Fighting Chongqing" stood firmly at the forefront of the bombing smoke lamp during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>"Walking in the Hospital" and "Ten Thousand Gold" write about the hardship and difficulty of a journalist's life during the Anti-Japanese War; writing about characters includes "Remembering Ying Yin," "Remembering Lu Shaofei," and "The Four Great Generals"; discussing drama and painting includes "Apricot Blossom Spring Rain Jiangnan," "Transformation," and "Requiem"; "Shen Tieru's Painting Exhibition," etc.</p>
<p>Among the thirty-five articles, there are epic reportage literature, essays, sketches, reading notes, character interviews... It contains such a wide range and diversity, and it shows its boldness and torrent in the midst of brightness and clarity.</p>
<p>This is a recommended masterpiece in the new spring of April.</p>
<h3>Li Xia Day</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>"I asked my child to buy two pounds of dried apricots, but you only gave me one and a half pounds?"</p>
<p>"My scales are not wrong at all, Madam. Have you weighed your child?"</p>
<h3>On the Imperial Examination, a Fine Tale</h3>
<p>— Mutao</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Quyuan, after being dismissed from his position as the education commissioner of Henan, spent his leisurely years writing about the past in the Chunzai Hall. Therefore, Zeng Wenzheng once said to my late father: I have two students, one is Li Shaoquan, who desperately imitates officials, and the other is Yu Quyuan, who desperately writes books. The so-called Chunzai Hall was the topic of the examination poem in the Gengxu Dynasty Examination, which was "Light Clouds, Sparse Rain, and Falling Flower Day." Wenzheng appreciated his first sentence, "Flowers Fall, Spring Always Remains," and placed him first (that is, Chaoyuan), so Mr. Qu used Chunzai to name the hall. This is similar to Yuan Suiyuan's saying "The distance between people is like the Milky Way," which was appreciated by Yin Wenduan, both being fine tales of the imperial examination. However, Suiyuan had children late, while Quyuan had grandchildren early. Historian Jie Qing, with the title of annotating yuan and filling the post of doctorate disciple, was a high scorer in the Jimao township examination, and passed the palace examination with the title of Tan Hua, which was Mr. Qu's most proud thing in his later years. Therefore, he made a couplet himself: "The old man is old and has a collection of tens of thousands of books, arranges thousands of books, and writes hundreds of books; What does the young man know? He is the first in the college examination, the second in the township examination, and the third in the palace examination." The second line is also a fine tale of fame, and the first line is that without Mr. Qu's identity, there would be no such tone. I say that the gains and losses of abolishing the imperial examination are another matter, but it is inevitable that it spoils the scenery, because the anecdotes and stories of the imperial examination era, which are passed down by word of mouth, are really interesting. For example, when Ruan Wenda took the government examination, he accidentally broke off a branch of apricot blossom in the courtyard after handing in the paper, which was seen by the prefect, who gave a pair: "A small scholar, secretly hiding the spring color in his sleeves." Wenda immediately replied: "A dignified prefect, clearly observing autumn hair in his eyes." It can be said to be extremely ingenious. Also, when Wenda was the education commissioner of Zhejiang, he once served as the supervisor of the township examination, and made a couplet: "Writing thousands of words, it is the time when the locust seeds are yellow, the osmanthus fragrant bag, leaving the door with a smile, watching the full moon in the West Lake, and the tide coming in the East Zhejiang." The excitement is high and the atmosphere is grand, which is also a fine tale of the imperial examination.</p>
<h3>Art and Literature Scene</h3>
<p>The "Rixin Literary Series" edited by Hu Shanyuan has been issued by Rixin Publishing House, including Hu Shanyuan's "Early Love" "My Writing Life," Zhongyuan's "Calamity," Tang Xianhua's "Transformation," Zhang Luo's "Hazy," Fang Peiyin's "Birth," Cheng Yuzhen's "Sound of Nature," Shen Ji's "Two Generations Map," Shi Qi's "Street Art," Xiao Qun's "On the Border," and other ten kinds, in this period of literary publishing decline, it is no less than a strong shot in the arm, all those who love literature and art should be eager to see it first, and it is sold in all bookstores.</p>
<p>Wang Jinshan's "Mountain Residence Sketches" is a collection of essays and thoughts written by the author during the war. Among them, "Ode to Flame" "Imitation Love Letter" "Mountain Residence" "Autumn Rain" and other articles, not only reflect the life of the literati in the rear, but also have many timeless writings, which have been widely circulated for a time. The book has recently been published by Zhengzhong Book Company.</p>
<p>The "Semi-Monthly Drama" edited by the owner of the Plum Blossom Pavilion was founded in April of the 26th year of the Republic of China, and the sales were smooth. It was once suspended after the war. It was resumed at the end of last year. The content is more substantial than before. The third issue of the sixth volume has just been published. It costs 3,000 yuan. The general distributor is the Semi-Monthly Drama Publishing House at No. 10, Lane 434, Section 2, Zhongzheng South Road, this city.</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Crisis</h3>
<p>— Chunshou Ou</p>
<p>Nearly ten years of selling her life has not worn away Jin Aili's loyal and honest nature. Hearing Lao Zhu say it so nakedly, she felt embarrassed on her face.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu looked at her very carefully.</p>
<p>"Aili, you are a good person! It's a pity you didn't study for a few more years."</p>
<p>"You don't want to teach me!" It was a reply that was both resentment and gratitude.</p>
<p>She also finished the cup of soy milk in front of her. Obviously, she thought that what Lao Zhu said was very reasonable, and felt that her problem had been solved, and she felt a lot more relaxed.</p>
<p>"If you're not angry, I'll give you the five hundred U.S. dollars now." Her hand gently covered Lao Zhu's hand, conveying a silent emotion.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu was not angry, but couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Aili, I won't be angry with you. But, I don't need money! I also have money!" He said as if coaxing a child.</p>
<p>"You also have money?" Jin Aili was a little surprised, but not very surprised. Because Lao Zhu was really a mystery to her. She never saw him doing any business or colluding with any officials, but she never saw him wearing ragged clothes or borrowing money from others; even a few times, she did know that Xiao Shen had borrowed money from Lao Zhu. Therefore, she simply had no idea what Lao Zhu's life was like and what his economic situation was like.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu nodded to her again, indicating that he did have money.</p>
<p>"Then why don't you leave?" The woman couldn't help but ask again.</p>
<p>The man knew that she wouldn't understand even if he explained, so he said vaguely:</p>
<p>"Many friends are together, I'm embarrassed to leave first."</p>
<p>"You have a conscience, I know!" Jin Aili felt a lot of emotion.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu felt that there was nothing to talk about, so he continued to eat heartily, and at the same time persuaded Jin Aili to eat more.</p>
<p>"I heard that your good friend Mrs. Hu hasn't left yet, aren't you thinking of a way for her?" Jin Aili couldn't eat anymore, and had a lot of things to say in her heart, and first mentioned .</p>
<p>"Old friend, not a good friend. Aili, don't say that! Friends are all the same." Lao Zhu smiled bitterly. "They really want to leave, but they can't get a car, so there's nothing they can do. Maybe they'll go to the train station again tonight to try, but a wife with two children may not be able to get on."</p>
<p>"Aren't you very resourceful?" Jin Aili challenged.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu was asked by her like this, and a belly full of complaints welled up. (38)</p>
