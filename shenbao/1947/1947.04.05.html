<p>〔本報南京四日電〕中樞近已在考慮征收一次財產稅，以期平衡本年度預算，一次財產稅之征課方案，由財部草擬中，征課範圍，將為：（一）城市之土地及鄕區非自耕之土地同一業主在五十畝以上者，（二）城市之房屋每幢現値在三千萬元以上者，（三）國人存在國內國外之外匯資產，（四）營利事業財產三千萬元以上者。又個人所有財產現値超過五萬萬元及法人財產淨値超過五萬萬元者，加征一次超額財產稅。惟公有財產經確切證明者，得免征一次財產稅。</p>

<h3>趙家驤抵瀋</h3>
<p>接收大連事在交涉中</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：接收大連之困難，除共軍之陰擾外，尚有其他問題，有待外交方法解決。例如依中蘇條約之規定，由中蘇共同管理大連自由港之碼頭，但據聞目前蘇方擬保存設備優良者，而以殘存不堪使用者移交我國，此其一。同時，在日本初投降時，大連市內之白俄紛與日僑訂約，取得大部房產之所有權，故我國接收大連後，如承認此類契約為有效時，則所接收者不啻為一空城，此其二。聞以上兩問題，均由主管機關與蘇方積極交涉中</p>

<h3>美政府訓令麥帥　日首期賠償品　立即開始艘運　我獲總數百分之十五</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕美國不顧遠東委員會其他各國之抗議，今日向麥師發出「臨時訓令」，囑其立即開始執行分配日太賠償物資。此項訓令仍將交由遠東委員會審查，但因美國係具有否決權國家之一，故除非美方同意，無法改變。據外交界官員稱：美國採取此種激列行動尚屬初次，對中國及其他受兵　各國有利，曾獲加拿大。中國·荷蘭·及菲律賓等國支持。</p>
<p>今日遠東委員會討論時時·蘇·法·印·澳等國均加反對，英國則未參加爭論。國務院今日舉行秘密會議，旋即發表遠東委員會美國代表麥克柯伊聲明全文，事能進展始見明顯。裏氏告中該委員會稱：二月十三日美國政府曾向該會提出立即開始分配日本賠償方案，美國認爲開始搬運賠償物資乃當前急務。麥氏指出開始搬運日本賠償現已稽延逾年後，隨即宣佈美國「臨時訓令」麥帥之決定。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓三日電〕遠東委員會今日舉行會議，美國代表麥克伊將軍發表聲明，內稱：「美國政府已決定對駐日佔領軍當局發出一項臨時命令，受權麥帥，立即將一部工業設備搬運至若十被戰爭摧毀國家，充常先期賠償之用。中國將獲得總數百分之十五，菲津賓百分之五，荷蘭百分之五（代荷印），聯合王國百分之五（代頃甸·馬來亞及其他殖民地）。在此先期賠償項下，美國一無所獲。」</p>
<p>按此項賠償工廠將達一千所，可分十大類，其中主要部份爲鋼鐵·造船·熱力電力廠·機械工其·航空工業·陸海軍兵工廠·及一部化學工業。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科三日電〕關於立即分配日本賠償事，美國向麥帥所發出之「臨時訓令」，係以遠東委員會法規爲根據，該項法規規定如遇緊急事件而委員會尚未決定政策時，美國有權發出臨時訓令，先行辦理，事後再提交委員會審查。</p>
<h3>美國斷然行動　將與蘇聨攤牌　爭門程度與德賠償問題相同</h3>
<p>〔聯台社華盛頓四日電〕分配日本賠償品事，美國今日已有行動，將與蘇聯攤牌，一切徵象均指示必有一塲爭鬥，其激烈常與莫斯科會議現因德國賠償問題而進行之爭鬥相同。日本工廠的一千所，已指定將運交各國，賠償戰爭損害，美國不顯蘇聯反對，擬將其中的三百所立即運往中國，菲律濱及英荷兩國東方屬地。美國昨日已在十一國組成之遠東委員會獲得初步勝利，斷然向麥帥發出「臨時訓令」。囑其立刻着手進行此計劃。據熟悉情勢之官方人士稱：初步討論時，蘇聯即加反對，其理由爲對於日本賠償應先商妥整個解決辦法，蘇方主張中國東九省價值二十億美元之戰爭工廠，應在最後解決日本賠償辦法時加以考慮，實爲主要問題之一。美國前於二月十三日，早已提出預先賠償之臨時計劃，遠東委員會對此，並無行動，美國遂繞過遠東委員會，直接訓令委帥，此舉固爲委員會法規所容許者。法國與印度不在臨時賠償之例，故加反對，澳洲則堅持一切賠償之撥付，須待日本和的簽訂，中國，紐西關，加拿大，荷請與菲律濱均擁護美國此舉。</p>

<p>泛亞洲會議於三月廿三日在新德里揭幕以來，會期十日，其間集三十二民族的代表相聚一堂，分組討論，頗有協議；除空泛的國際關係原則予以重申外，此次泛亞會議的召開，決定設置一個定名爲亞洲關係協會的常設機關，並組織一包含亞洲各國代表三十人之臨時理事會。此實爲亞洲各民族加緊團結的具體表現；對此亞洲世紀的來臨，位居亞東的我國人民，自然表示衷誠的慰藉和歡欣。茲當泛亞會議閉幕之際，願略申我們的觀感。</p>
<p>在這個亞洲世紀到來的今日，亞洲人的需要團結是無待多所闡明的。但亞洲僅是一個地理的名稱，爲世界大陸面積的一部。由於其幅員的遼闊，歷史的悠長，亞洲人民雖同居於同一大陸上，不特有人種上的殊異，抑且有文化上的不同。此次召開的泛亞會議，有埃及代表的參加，可見所謂亞，所謂泛亞，其意義實至含混。歐洲的歷史過程與亞洲的不同，由於羅馬帝國及基督敎的流行，歐洲的民族雖繁多，在文化歷史上却是一個單位，亞洲的歷史就並不如此。美洲在文化上原是歐洲的延績，加以西班牙在南北美的開拓，故美洲的獨立國家在數量上雖不少，但彼此脈絡相承，本係一家。泛美運動，泛歐運動，因此，是有其歷史的因素在起着作用的。亞洲各民族的歷史發展，與歐美的過程不同；成吉思汗和帖木兒之流雖形成某種大一統的局面，但對於整個亞洲的歷史却不曾有永恒的印痕。亞洲各民族沒有相同的歷史背景，因此，泛亞運動的展開，實較泛歐泛美運動爲艱難。過去的日本軍閥於是想以「八紘一宇」爲號召，掀起所謂大亞細亞運動。這是以日本軍閥爲中心的侵略運動，其結果的失敗，本在意中。</p>
<p>正因爲亞洲各民族缺乏共同的歷史背景，所以此次泛亞會議召開的成功，我們表示無限的欣慰。歷史文化乃至語言種族上，彼此有着極大差異的各亞洲民族而能相聚一堂，召開所謂泛亞洲會議，幾乎是一件不可想像的事，然而這一次者屆泛亞會議却竟然召開了，而且還有這樣的成功。這在一方面固然是受了甘地尼赫魯等個人聲譽的感召，一方面也表示出亞洲各民族有加緊團結的自覺。今日的亞洲是處在兩大壁壘之問，而亞洲各民族在政治經濟以及社會各方面的發展，還多少停留在一個落後的階段。當人類已經進入原子能的時代，而亞洲各民族的生活與他們過去燦爛的歷史時期，並沒有多大的改觀。聖雄甘地的手搖紡紗機和他的一隻山羊，當我們想起是出現在一個人類已進入原子能的時代，眞使我們感觸多端。正惟其在各方面的落後，今日亞洲各民族，允需要密切的團結。這是爲此，所以我們看見有泛亞會議召開的成功。</p>
<p>然而一種運動的得以持久，却不能全持心理上共同的要求；必須有一種精神上活的泉源，始能將這種心理上共同的要求趨淤凝固。亞洲各民族在人種上，思想上，文化上並沒有共同的因素，欲使這一運動的持久成功，必須尋覓一種共同的精神源泉。馬克思列寗主義不能不說是一種活的精神因索，而西方世界的一種共同精神因素又不能不悅是基督敎的傳統。如今當泛亞運動展開之際，我們旺衡當前局勢，深覺惟有三民主義綫能爲此一運動的活的精神源泉。三民主義的中正和平與甘地尼赫魯在印度所倡導的運動之目的，不謀而合，應該可爲泛亞運動的指導原則，茲當泛亞會議閉幕之際，我們願提供此點，以供參考。</p>

<h3>外長會議仍少進展　賠償問題僵局一時難打開　德選舉制度問題引起激辯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科四日廣播二關於德國賠償問題，自馬歇爾捉出折衷方案後，各方均注意莫洛托夫。馬歇爾之方案，雖有打破僵局之可能，但距離蘇方之需求仍甚遠。按照馬歇爾主張，蘇方究能獲得多少賠償，現未獲悉。據最近消息：莫洛托夫絕無妥協之意向。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科四日〕四外長會議之調整委員會由於該委。會爲便對四外長至今爲止之元成工作整理就緒起見，今日之會議中，幾完全受該委員會支配。爲便於予該委員會增加時間進行工作，四外長決定將開會時問，比尋常延遲兩小時，即至下午六時，而非四時開會。在今晚之會議中，據四外長指出，渠等希望對德國和約解決兩項最嚴重之問題，即德國未來邊疆及向之提出之賠款要求問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新開社莫斯科三日電〕開於德國之選舉制度，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫本日在四國外長會議席上提議。主張採取比例代表制，但爲英國外相貝文所反對，因而發生激辯。貝文外相稱：比例代表制實爲舊式之社會民主制度，余對於任何制度凡足以造成一黨專政者，均表示反對。莫洛托夫外長當即答曰：余承認比例代表制，爲舊式之民主制度，但吾人至少應拒絕爲希臘國內現行之獨裁制及反民主制有所聲辯。貝文外相駁粵曰：閣下所提議之比例代表制，已在希臘實施。莫洛托夫外長反唇相議曰：此足以證明一項元善之制度，落入過份有經騐人之手中後，即能生產別種結果。以余個人而集結，寗願採取法國所行之比代表制，而不願採取希臘所行之比例代表制。四國外長旋即討論某小組委員會（負責審議調整委員會之工作情形者）所提出之報告書，歷時頗久，對於一切政治問題，均未獲致協議，僅在原則上通過法國外長比杜爾所提淸理德國戰爭潛力之建議。但四國外畏對於比杜爾所提出各種日期，並未成立協議。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科四日廣播：莫洛托夫今向美記者稱。蘇聯有關德國統一之建議及美方促成德國採用聯邦制之主張，甚有妥協可能性，但採　聯邦制問題，應由德國人民以公民投票方式自行決定。</p>
<h3>美參院外交委會　通過援助希土案　艾克遜答覆議員質詢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕參院外交委員會業於本日通過杜魯門總統所提援助希土二國之法案，但主席范登堡提出一驚人修正案，主張安理事會或聯合國大會倘表反對，隨時可以多數票將此一計劃取消，國務院對此亦表擁護，以對聯合國與國會抨繫人士表示好感，蓋彼等皆譴責此舉乃踰越世界機構之職權故也。據稱，美國當不致否決聯合國使共退出希土二國之命令，但聯合國若不謀一補救辦法，則亦不能使其停止援助之計劃。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕參院外交委員會通過援助希土法案之後，各委員相繼提出詢問，有詢以「政府是否在考慮採取對希臘之同樣措施，以援助中國政府抵禦中共軍」，代理國務卿艾克遜答曰，希臘情形乃與中國逈不相同，故政府不擬對二國採取同樣之行動，但美國已在財政上對中國政府予以極大之借款，並已以武器，配備中國軍隊的三十九師。有詢以「美國是否在擬定一般原則，作爲對世界各地政策之根據，尤其是對於中國，波蘭，芬蘭，伊朗，伊拉克，阿富汗，內蒙古等」，艾克遜答曰，凡外國政府要求予以援助時，吾人當就各個情形，加以考慮，所將採取之措施，自當與對希土二國者相近似云。</p>
<h3>美國務院解釋　援助希土眞義</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕美國國務院本日發表長達四十六頁之文件，答獲各參議員對於美國援助希土兩國計劃所提出之問題一百十一件，略稱，美國援助希土兩國計劃，不能視爲一包圍」蘇聯或任何其他國家，希臘境內共產黨所領導之武裝匪徒，正受外國之鼓勵，殆無疑義。蘇聯政府對於美國援助希土兩國，不應視爲一種需要蘇聯採取報復手段之行動。國務院對於此一問題之觀點如次：（一）美國擬將「有限」數量之剩餘軍事物資，運往伊朗；（二）美國並不欲以援助希土兩國爲手段而成爲韃靼尼爾海峽之「共同看守者」，良以美國對於韃靼尼爾海峽並不負有任何特殊責任故也；（三）美國之計劃不應視爲「包圍」碌聯或任何其他國家；（四）共產黨所領導並加以武裝之匪徒，實希臘獨立之主要威脅。</p>
<p>〔路透社稚典三日電〕希臘外交部長蔡爾達理斯今日稱：蘇聯駐希大使羅狄亞諾夫之被召返國，或與蘇政府最近召回駐英美大使述職之性質相同。按羅狄亞諾夫於一月底返希後，即未州與希政府接觸，亦未向喬治王呈遞國書，渠僅曾向前攝政達馬斯　諾斯主敎呈國書。</p>

<h3>杜魯門答記者問　解釋國內外各項問題</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕杜魯門總統頃舉行每週記者招待會上答覆各項問題，發表談話如次；（一）余元全信任內長克魯格並無要求其辭職之意，克魯格當於日內答復路易斯；（二）關於電話工人罷工一事，余已命令勞工部研究辦法，如若工人罷工，政府即將征用電話綢；（三）國務卿馬歇爾元帥是否將遄返美國，余在此未便表意見；（四）余對於援助希土兩國，心胸中尚無緊急計劃；（五）芝加哥市長改選民主黨候選人凱向民主黨；（六）余最近對於各政府機關公務員所頒佈之命令，乃在取得公務員之效忠政府，並非恐懼共產黨推翻美國政府，此種說法，實屬荒謬云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三電〕關於美國取締共產黨一項問題，頃據消息靈通人士談稱，杜魯門總統縝密研究之後，對於胡佛主張國會不應採取任何措施，使共產黨成爲非法政黨一層表示同意，良以共產黨不論在選舉方面或直接行動方面均無成功之機會，而今取締共產黨對於美國民主自由足以成爲一大危機云。</p>

<h3>旁聽席擁擠不堪　退庭時萬家燈火　林楊詹分別傳提到案　金潮案初次公審　詳代介暗信過程　承信五家商事情悉由央行圈定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕官商勾結操縱黃金案，地院於昨日下午二時，初次傳被告中央銀行前業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，及提金號業公會理事長詹業生等三人到案審訊，並傳證人馮淸庵（楊慶和發記銀樓經理）·張柏園（大豐恒金號經理）·倪祖光（方九霞昌記銀樓經理）。謝秉泉（大康源金號經理）·王麗源（同豐餘金號職員）。王松濤（央行業務局襄理兼出納股主任）·應鳴和（同豐餘金號經理），到庭作證。除應嗚和因接到傳票過遲，不及趕到外，餘皆到案。經在家焯推事六小時之隔別訊問後，諭知改期再審。被告林鳳苞•楊安仁仍交原保中央銀行，詹蓮生還押。退處時已萬家燈火。</p>
<p>地院刑二庭昨因「金潮案」開審，特加派法警守衛，旁聽席滿座，後來者咸被擯門外。律師席記者席上允擁擠。庭上詢過被告林·楊·詹三人年齡籍貫後，即由書官記朗誦上月廿八日所傳訊馮淸庵·張柏園·倪祖光·謝秉泉四證人口供筆錄。讀畢後，詹之辯護人陳霆說律師聲稱：證人中所供，詹蓮生參加央行決定黃金一點，與事實不符，請詳詢三被告。方九霞經理倪風光亦請更正，謂詹未參加決定價格，一切均由央行自定。庭上申斥云：作僞證要負刑責，上次已說明，何以今日又翻供。嗣即開始個別訊問。</p>
<p>林鳳苞</p>
<p>供稱：中央銀行業務局之組織，設局長一人，副局長六人，襄理十餘人。局長，副局長及各股主任，對業務上均分層負責。央行黃金拋售政策，係根據去年二月廿五日國防最高會所決議之開放外匯黃金自由賣買方案，並有開放外匯方案第二十九條規定國有黃金授權中央銀行，察酌市情，自由賣買。中央銀行前總裁貝祖詒親自決定明配暗售，以金號業銀樓業爲對象。去年三月八日起開始辦理最初之十餘日，黃金價格明配暗售均由貝親自主持，其後交業務局負責。</p>
<p>明配暗售·初曾收效</p>
<p>明配價格，每日於上午十時參照市情決定。黃金市塲雖九時即已開始交易，然黃金與外匯有不可分離之關係，而外匯需十時方有行情，故金價亦於每晨十時決定。暗售於去年三月九日開始，明配每大僅有一次，因央行旨在抑平金價，如金市中途高漲，即以暗告方式經過指定商號拋出，使市塲上不知係央行售出。價格係照當時行情之最高價，以增加國庫收人。而同時籌碼增多，供給增加，可收抑平之效。庭上詰詢：央行旣時時以抑平金價爲職志，何以金價仍日日上漲。林答稱：去年三·四·五·六•七數月來，央行之黃金政策頗有成績，此時期中金價始終在二百萬左右。八月十九日國府調整外匯，金價曾一度暴漲，央行即全力抑制，不二日又告穩定，十月以後游責葉中黃金，央行拋售已不能控制，故於二月初由最高當局決定停配。</p>
<p>承售五店·央行所定</p>
<p>至放與詹生並非素識，當決定配售黃金時，貝總裁召前金業理事徐波聲來行接治時所介紹。詹以金號業公會理事長身份來見，並隨帶來金號業會負六十餘家名册，經擇其中信譽素著者五家，指定承售。黃金明配，由央行無限制供給，毋需申請。同豐餘，太康潤，方九霞，楊慶和，大豐恒等五家亦係央行逕行圈定，並未經過申請手續。央行配金亦不用申請單。更因央行金塊化成十兩重之金條工作，係委託同豐餘代辦，故有時爲便利計，配金直接向同豐餘領取。配金上午成交者，當天交割，下午成交者，隔日交割，不能欠款。庭上又以央行賬目與承配金號銀樓賬目不符處詰詢，林稱：央行賬目因每日必需與現款數目平衡，故決無錯誤。</p>
<p>楊安仁</p>
<p>供稱：任央行副局長職，專管金銀部份。配售黃金係政府國策，央行業務局僅奉行而已。明配由央行無限制供給，暗售亦無硬性規定。申請單係金號銀樓業會員與公會間之一種手續，與央行無關。央行明配定價十分公開，故未用繁複手續。詹　生係素職，因彼戰前爲金業經紀人公會會長，與央行早有往來，故早熟悉。暗售黃金，指定五家，分二組。太康潤獨立，取金時毋需詹連生蓋章擔保。方九霞，同豐餘，大豐恒，楊慶和四家取金時，如款不足，需詹蓋童擔保。</p>
<p>詹蓮生</p>
<p>供稱；同豐餘係合夥組織，共分十五股，央行職員並無股份。與林鳳苞以前並不認瞰，楊安仁則認識已有十餘年。黃金配價，無論明暗，皆由央行自定，我無從參加。明配時先由金號銀樓決定條數，然後央行開價。如嫌貴可减少條數，但不許增加。暗售則不定時，亦不定數。上午交割常用本票，下午則有少數現鈔。庭上提出同豐餘客戶賬上，有「中職」，「中役」，「中央友」記名，作何解釋。詹答：「中職」係央行中下級職員購金時所用，「中役」係央行門房，工役，老司務買賣黃金戶名，「中央友」大槪係央行職員朋友。王松濤係央行業務局襄理，兼出納主任，曾向同豐餘購黃金百餘條。至於賬目上詳細情形，需訊應鳴和可知。</p>
<p>三被告訊畢，庭上逐一遍訊各證人。王松濤否認購金，謂僅代親友介紹。王麗源亦否認有央行高級職員託其購賣金條。其餘諸證人所稱大致與前相仿。</p>
<h3>「洋老虎」案　今晨實地查勘</h3>

<h3>敵僞時期　虹口一覇　自稱「人頭」熟被迫做區長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕曾任敵海軍保甲第三區區長吳紀發，昨晨在高院受審。因吳居住虹口多年，在敵僞時期爲虹口著名之惡覇，聞風而來旁聽者極爲擁擠，座無隙地，後至者佇立諦聽。吳肥頭胖耳，着灰布罩袍，足登黃皮鞋，對劉庭長訊問各節，侃侃答辯。</p>
<p>查吳紀發，四十三歲，丹陽人，住塘山路七七三號，開設麵館。敵軍盤踞上海時期，曾將蘇州河以北地帶，劃爲敵海軍警備地區，設保甲本部於平凉路廿五號，派戚守禹負責，將大連灣路，兆豐路，朱家巷，黃浦江間地域，定為第三區，三十年十一月起派吳任該區區長，兼該區偽靑年團團長，擅作威福，爲害商民，曾向民衆徵銅，勒收保甲捐，飛機捐，强迫參如自警團站崗，及防空訓練，隨時封鎖交通，搜抄行人。又曾開設吳芳旅館，有旅客王燕華，羅家裕販賣麻袋八百隻，該旅館賬房戴翼擬强買二百隻未遂，報告敵軍，指麻袋爲軍用品，全部沒收。勝利後經被害人人余森康，王燕華，馮二毛等告訴，高檢處以吳罪嫌重大，以漢奸嫌疑案提起公訴。</p>
<p>吳昨答辯時，對於曾任敵海軍保甲第三區區長兼僞靑年團團長，承認不諱。惟稱：「因戚守禹常到我店裹來吃麵，看我在地方上人頭很熟，他說：小開出來做事吧，不做不行的，除非把你的店搬到重慶去。後來東洋人又來壓迫我，沒有辦法出來當區長」。對於庭上運續發問之徵銅，徵收保甲捐，飛機捐，均稱不知道，諉之於保甲本部。乾咳一聲，以掩飾其窘態。對於自警團站崗，稱係防小癟三偸東西。對於封鎖，稱沒有這個權柄。對於沒收吳芳旅館旅客王燕華，羅家裕麻袋八百隻，稱：「吳芳旅館房閒很小，根本放不下八百隻麻袋」。</p>
<p>嗣傳王燕華，馮二毛，及另一被害人之陳扣弟之母，訊問一過，以本案尚需調查，諭知改期再訊，被告遠押。</p>

<h3>師範敎育運動週的意義</h3>
<p>— 顧毓琇</p>
<p>敎不倦，學不厭，敎學相參，知及仁守。嚴如父，慈如母，嚴慈互濟，禮立樂成。</p>
<p>今天是師範敎育運動週，我準備簡單地叙述一下師範敎育運動週的意義。</p>
<p>先講師範二字的意義，所謂師就是老師，範就是模範。師範學校，在中國新學制開始時，已經有了相當的數目，它的目的，在於敎人如何做老師，所以，是一個培養老師的塲所。我們之提倡師範敎育運動，乃是說明今日師資，在數量上還不够分配。因為大學都認為，大學敎授，如何敎學，另有辦法；只有中小學與幼稚園的敎師，則非有專門學校來從事專業訓練不可。</p>
<p>記得這次師範敎育運動週的紀念會上，陳鶴琴先生曾經用機器來比喻兒童，他說：機器損壞了，并非任何人都可以來修理的，至於一個兒童，其心理發展狀態，遠較機器為繁複，更非任何人都可以敎的，除非他具有方法，熱情與認識。我們必先學會如何做老師，然後才能做一個好的老師。</p>
<p>幾年來，由於學校增加，知識進步，師資大感缺乏。於是，我們舉辦了很多的師範學校，並且用公費來獎勵師範學生，使他們在學校中免費求學，離學校後，能够長時間服務敎育界。但因學生入學很少，師資缺乏問題，仍然無法解決。因此，提倡師範敎育運動週，一方面可使學生得一訓練機會；另一方面，由於師範敎育運動週，要學生在面前舉行宣誓典禮，使他們了解做老師，須有不斷服務的精神。同時，在抗戰時期中，由於生活的壓迫，不得不離開敎師，而勝利後又重返敎育界的老師們，我們也借此機會，來表示歡迎。這樣，對於師資缺乏問題的解答，可以得到一點帮助了。</p>
<p>師範敎育運動從開始到今天，已有五年，這一次已是第六次的師範敎育運動週了。當第一次舉行的時候，本人正在敎育部服務，陳部長與本人商量了一聯對子，現在順便吿訴大家。這個對子，原先已經忘記了，幾天前由於復旦大學章校長的提醒，才重新記起來的。</p>
<p>這對子的上聯第一句是「敎不倦」，誨人不倦的意思，就是說敎別人永遠不感到疲倦。其次是「學不厭」，因為學無止境，必須繼續求學，這不僅是對老師而言，同時也是對每一個人說的。「敎學相參」，老師自修學習，固然可以充實自己的學問，可是由於敎讀而得到的參證工夫，進步也是很大的。當我們在學校的時候，總以為自己對各種學科都能頭頭是道，一旦離開了學校去敎別人，才感覺到自己敎不出什麼東西來，敎而後知不足，於是，你就得準備。有許多大學敎授，就因為敎學生而成為專家的。中小學及幼稚園的敎師，時時和活潑的兒童接觸，一定會有很大的進步，所以說敎與學是互相啓發增進。下一句即「知及仁守」，就是說知識探求得到了，於是以仁，以博愛來繼續維持久遠。上面的話合起來，便是「敎不倦，學不厭，敎學相參，知及仁守」，這一聯是針對着老師的求學來說的。</p>
<p>下聯也是對老師講的，這要所講的乃是老師的態度和敎育的功能與目的。一位老師應當要「嚴如父」，像父親樣的嚴肅，「慈如母」，像母親樣的慈祥。敎師如父母，父母是兒童最親愛的人，也是最受兒童歡迎的人，俗語說的「勿誤人子弟」，可見敎師地位是如何的緊要。但敎師僅僅慈如母，則不免失之於寬，僅僅嚴如父，則不免失之於厲，寬則易使兒童放縱，厲則易使兒童痛苦。所以敎師必當「嚴慈互濟」，不可偏廢。以往敎師每以嚴師自居，但新敎育則並不如此，他要求了解兒童心理，感化兒童行為，要嚴慈兼施，這樣，做起來似乎不大容易，但要敎育成功，則非做到這樣不可。最後一句是「禮立樂成」，古人有說的，制定立禮，功成作樂。禮以嚴肅為主，如父親一般，樂以慈和為主，如母親一般。假使只有禮，則呆板而流於可怕的束縛；只有樂，則又易流於柔　和散漫。所以，孔子制禮樂互相為用，缺一不可。六藝敎育的基本目的在於建國，建國的成功要素，當視敎育的完成。這一聯合起來，便是「嚴如父，慈如母，嚴慈互濟，禮立樂成」。</p>
<p>總之，師範敎育運動的意義，一方面是在喚起社會尊敬敎師，另方面在鼓勵敎師奮起完成其偉大的任務。希望大家齊來廣泛推動師範敎育運動，無論是敎師，家長，及社會各界人士，一致參加這個師範敎育運動週，羣策羣力，做到敎育第一，建國成功！</p>

<h3>婦女的乳巖</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>乳巖是婦人乳病中最險惡的病，壯盛者不多見，衰老者再易患之。由來甚遠，先於乳內起一硬核，乳內有時覺有一抽之痛，就是初徵，此時即着手醫治，多可治癒，失期延誤，變成如拳如碗，體硬如石，或至潰爛，現出無數瘡口，勢如　巖，雖有良醫，也不易着手。</p>
<p>中國醫家對乳巖的成因，各有各的理由。陳遠公謂氣血大虧所致。陳實功謂憂鬱傷肝，思慮傷脾，積想在心，所願不得志者，以致經絡痞澀，結聚成核所致，則與外國學者所謂神經系對於種種腫痬之限局與發生有關之說相似。</p>
<p>汪省之外科理例說：「乳巖四十以下可治，五十以上不可治，治之則死，不治則反得其天年。」</p>
<p>漢卿說：「女子已嫁未嫁，俱生此候，乃陰極陽衰，虛陽與血相積，血滲入心經而成，未破可治，已破即難治。」</p>
<p>胡公弼說：「乳巖乃女子性情多疑忌，或不得志於翁姑，或不得意於夫子，失於調理，忿邕所釀，憂鬱所積，以致厥陰之氣不行，陽明之血沸騰，乳竅不通，結成堅核，形如棋子，或五七年不發，或十餘年不發，後因歲運流行，或因大怒觸動，一發起爛，開如翻花石榴，凡三十歲內氣血旺者可治，四十以外氣血衰敗者難治。」</p>
<p>綜合右列諸說，關於乳巖的預後，就可想見一般了。</p>
<p>女子患了乳巖，是極可扼腕的病。醫生治乳巖，是極不痛快的事。患乳巖其欲冀恢復健康，必須具備基礎的原則：第一須有充裕之家庭經濟，可以供服藥之用。第二須心氣和平，悉聽醫者之指導。第三保持優良的營養。</p>
<p>乳巖的剔除手術，其面積及核不廣大者可以施之。</p>
<p>乳巖的藥物治療，憑多年經騐覺得初起之症，只要十至二十劑左右的陽和湯或小金丹槪可消滅。陳遠公之化巖　，綫靑榆之消乳巖丸俱可參酌槮用。</p>
<p>輕而初起之癌，簡易方若鯽魚膏蟹瞉散都很通用的。</p>
<h3>痛經</h3>
<p>— 朱渧然</p>
<p>月經是婦女生理上一種特殊機能，原為生死的一種準備，月經的經常與病變，對婦女的健康，有極密切的關係，而對於生育問題，更有影響。</p>
<p>一般婦女的月經病，種類很多，最普通的是痛經，上海婦女的痛經，更比內地的婦女要普遍。</p>
<p>痛經的原因很多，或因生理上的畸形，或花柳的潛伏，或因房慾的過度，或因物理的刺激，尤其服裝的拘束，往往也形成痛經的病候。</p>
<p>痛經的病徵，就是婦女月經於將來時期，腰脹小腹痛，乳發硬，而覺脹，四肢疲倦，食慾减衰，或於月經來時，腹部脹痛，經血有時結塊。</p>
<p>痛經病的偶然性，有時不治也會自愈，常習性者愈演愈劇。</p>
<p>痛經病不治愈，到了中年以後，往往變成乾血　，子宮癌等病。</p>
<p>我把痛經的治法，槪括起來，有下列數法：</p>
<p>（一）疎肝法　起於情志抑鬱的月經痛，在中醫的治法中，有疎肝法，就是用逍遙散加减，一面可以條達肝氣，一面可以增暢血液，那是很穩妥的方法。</p>
<p>（二）養血法　因血液乾枯，血道不能暢流，只要把血培養充足，循環自能有力，疼痛等病機就會消退。</p>
<p>（三）逐瘀法　因血塊阻塞，血道不通，隨而發痛經病者，只要將血塊消除，經行自暢，而痛也自能消失。</p>
<p>（四）溫經法　子宮陰寒，血陰不行，用肉桂，吳萸等可以根治。</p>
<p>（五）凉血法　血海有熱，發為疼痛，大槪子宮內膜，子宮實質，以及喇叭管等，都有發炎的症象，惟一治法，就要用丹皮，生地等凉血之品。</p>
<p>（六）解憂法　此法是心理療法的一種，昔有一友人之妻，患痛經頗劇，百醫罔效，我為其講述些故事，竟受忘其痛苦。</p>
<h3>藥事二則</h3>
<p>— 岑志良</p>
<p>改良製藥　中藥和中醫有密切關係，中藥之功效，誰亦不能否認之，惟是製法永不進步，乃至不能出國門一步，此後應當採科學方法來改良，庶幾為醫者在臨床上應用，較為便利，而收效亦自倍蓗。</p>
<p>種植藥材　中國所謂道地藥材，都是自然產品，然有幾種藥因需要者多，而其產量又少，以致價格高昂，影響營業，故有採用泊來品者，欲救其弊，必需產量豐富，欲產量豐，必須提倡人工種植。</p>

<h3>『莧菜』在醫學上之價値</h3>
<p>— 龔佩英</p>
<p>含維他命丙特富</p>
<p>我們在本草綱目上，看見莧菜可以治病，初很奇怪，因為他不過是一種普通菜肴，沒有什麼了不得所以我們也就藐視了它！</p>
<p>可是經最近的硏窿，覺到它的功效不少。從前韓保昇道「：莧菜有赤莧，白莧，人莧，紫莧，五色莧，馬莧六種。人莧，白莧，可入藥用。赤莧味辛，別有功用。」蘇頌說：「人莧，白莧，性寒，一名糖莧。一名胡莧。又名細莧。其實一樣。不過大的稱白莧，小的稱人莧罷了。白莧補氣，除熱，通九竅，赤莧治赤痢。紫莧殺虫毒，治氣痢。人莧能利大小腸，治一切痢疾滑胎。」現在科學家報吿白莧與赤莧，都含有鈣質，而赤莧含鐵更多，普通市塲所售的白莧，每公分有一又百分之九公厘的丙種維生素。赤莧則每公分僅含百分之二五公厘，於此可見丙種維生素的含量，白莧多五倍。</p>
<p>並且斷定莧菜所含維生素丙種的功用，與美國橘子相同，也能治壞血病。反一句說，常食這東西，能免壞血病的侵襲。</p>
<p>現在壞血病在小兒極多，這種含有實貴成分的莧菜，不妨多多的選擇着，作為不藥的醫治呀。</p>
<p>滿大地</p>
<h3>砂眼</h3>
<p>— 葉勁秋</p>
<p>前幾年，某醫誌要我寫些單方一類的稿子。就寫了胡蝶梅蘭芳一行出國前之一段小故事，給他。大意說：</p>
<p>歐西各國，對砂眼一症，頗為注視，縱有些微小恙，亦必嚴得防範，吾華人之旅彼邦者，檢視尤嚴，因為我國人太不注意了。那次胡蝶梅蘭芳等一行出國之前，有隨從十三人，皆稍有目患，因以頗受留難，求治又不易速痊。正在無法解决之際，中委李石曾先生，出一秘方。方為鯉魚胆汁，調東丹敷塗患處，頓獲痊可。秘方之奇，誠有出人意料之外者。</p>
<p>自此揭載後，頗蒙多數人士注意。有鄭君緘三者，首先致書本市國醫公會，詢問藥理。晶報記者，西階先生，亦曾間接詢問梅博士究竟。旋得覆函云：</p>
<p>前承囑轉詢砂眼治療事，昨夜畹華（梅博士字）招飲，當於席上叩之。據云：赴美以前，團中患砂眼者不少，有人開一偏方，以靑魚胆及黃丹（此係藥品，各藥店均有之。）共硏末，以水調和，滴入眼中少許。患者照此療治，後經檢騐，皆得通過。惟此方對於砂眼，是還確實有效，則不敢知，但知當時團中確有行之者耳。—見廿五年八月四日晶報</p>
<p>旣而（八月八日）晶報復刋包君澄馥一文云：</p>
<p>敝人小兒今年十二歲，正患有砂眼病症，延醫診治，殊鮮有效。閱報不覺喜躍。諺云，丹方一味，氣煞名醫。即往藥店，購就靑魚胆及黃丹，如法調治。不意藥甫入眼，小兒即喊痛甚，至眼球紅筋驟起。敝人不諳醫理，是否初治有此現象，迨後即可奏效。更不知梅先生劇團團員，療治時，亦有此現象否。</p>
<p>攷該方出自南唐陳士良所撰聖惠方中，方用鉛丹半兩，鯉魚胆汁和如膏，日點二三次，專治眼生珠管，東丹即鉛丹，又名黃丹，丹粉，朱粉，皆以鉛所煉成。查砂眼有顆粒性，乳頭性，瘢痕性，混合性之不同。鉛質於限亦有不利，但古方眼藥中每用之，或亦古今發煉之不同歟。再眼藥大都水飛，即細至無可再細者，入眼驟起疼痛，大槪與粗細有關係。</p>
<p>（存仁按：此方已交眼科陸南　，李岐　兩君硏究中。徵求患砂眼者若干人免費醫治，可函威海衛路一號　覆。）</p>
<h3>痧子用西河柳之疑問</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>西河柳之治療痧子，已盡人皆知，且為民間治痧子習用之一　單方。照吾鄕無錫之習慣，小兒於痧子初見之時，即訪取西河柳煎湯服之，謂其有透發之性，可以催促痧子之速透，以免有意外之變也。然據鄞縣人之習慣，迨痧子回時，方始服西河柳。故余初來上海，治痧子用西河柳，遇鄞縣人，必請問西河柳可服否？怪面究其故，始知「各土各法，各廟菩薩。」自此對於西河柳之治痧子，即發生一疑問：蓋痧子初起，重在透發，藥須採用發揮而含有少許刺激性者，即老法所謂性熱之品；痧子回時，重在解毒，藥須採用消炎退熱或有養陰作用者，即老法所謂性寒之品。西河柳性味若何？於痧子方面，究有何種作用？此則不能不加以考慮者。</p>
<p>同一病症，市區吳鄕區，其發生之徵象往往互異，即以痧子而言，鄕區小兒，往往面紅氣粗，大渴求飲，大便秘結，舌苔黃厚或舌質綠乾。治療之法，不出二途：一即表裏雙解一面透表發其痧子，一面導下通其大便，功用雖相反，其收效實能相成。一即用「黑靑湯」法一面透表，一面養陰，以救其垂涸之津液而增加其抵抗力，因其內熱熾盛，故性寒之品不特不禁，甚且有以速用為妥者，如「麻杏石甘湯」一方，並不以其內有石膏而廢除之，且有視為痧子變逆時之急救效方焉。至於市區—尤其上海一隅，患痧子之小兒，雖有高熱，往往面色　白，亦少見絳乾之舌質，故通常祗採用開肺宣表之一法，以助其外達之勢。於此而有所悟，竊意西河柳之治痧子，非透發也，實取其淸解也，吾錫之用於初始見點，乃就身熱面來氣組者而設，與鄞人之用於回時，時間雖各異，於作用上實有異曲同工之妙焉。</p>
<p>此後，余於痧子初見而熱扃渴飲煩燥氣粗者，即於處方中用西河柳，無此現象，即置不用，其目的不在於透發，而在於淸熱，十餘年來，幸無事故。然西河柳之實際功能，究竟如何？個人私見，是否可靠？尚為一疑團，望吾同道，其有眞知灼見者，進而敎之，幸甚！</p>

<h3>國行指定二十三城市　募銷美金債券　上海　銀錢業憶認講四千萬元美金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年短期美金庫券及美金公債，今日起，即由中央銀行國庫局，及上海受委託之八十一家行莊，先行發售預的券。迄目前爲止，上海銀錢兩業公會，業已認購短　庫券美金三千萬元，合國幣三千六百億元。美金公債美金一千萬元，合國幣一千二百億元。已佔該項償券第一期發行總額美金二億元五分之一。南京銀錢兩業公會，亦已認講債券十億元。南京中國水泥公司，亦已認購一億元。至各地之發行事宜，國行亦已分電南京，重慶，廣州，杭州，天津，西安，漢口，昆明，北平，靑島，南昌，九江，蕪湖，蚌埠，無錫，鎮江，長沙，衡陽，桂林，蘭州，福州，厦門，汕頭等二十三地國行分支行，即日籌組募銷委員會，及委託各地合格行莊，代理經銷事宜。</p>
<h3>上海募委員公開會　錢新之當選主任委員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年短期　劵及美金公債上海募銷委員會，於昨日下午四時，在國行三樓會議室，召開成立會議，到全體委員十七人，討論迄六時許散會，當選主委錢新之，副主委杜月笙·徐寄廎。並聘　倫爲委員會秘書長，范鶴言爲副秘書長。會後主委錢新之對新聞界發表談話，略稱：美金庫券公債，尚係勝利後首次發行之債券。目的在穩定經濟現狀，蓋戰時財政，大部借重於通貨之發行，致形成通貨彭脹，物價騰漲，支出浩繁，影響及於一般人民。茲者欲穩定物價，减少通貨之發行，同時吸收市塲游資，則需大家踴躍認購債券。對國家對人民，均有利益。按此次發行之美金庫券公債，均有外匯基金及殷實之財產作保證。又基金監理委會，每六月需報告基金收付之數額。且該項債券，又得自由買賣抵押，可作金融業之保證準備，亦可用作繳付國行存款準備金，故條件非常優異。現上海銀錢兩業公會，包括三行兩局，已先認購該項債券共美金四千萬元。現該項債券之預約券，已分發各委託行莊，即希各界踴躍認購云。</p>
<h3>公債司長　陳炳章談　充份運用公債政策</h3>
<p>旋斯部公債司司長陳炳章，應各報記者之請，答覆問題數則，茲誌大要如次：（一）黃金成色鑑別辦法，待財部與國行洽商後決定。（二）各委託行莊經銷之手續費，已決定爲債劵發行額千分之一。其分配辦法，由國行決定。（三）各行莊收之債款，按規定係十日一結。（四）基金監理委會可能在下週二在上海成立，屆時財部俞部長，或將親自出席參加。（五）美金公債基金，已由財部飭國行撥出外匯基金若干作抵。短期庫券，係以國營生產事業及敵僞產業作抵。由經濟部，資委會，及敵僞產業處理委會洽商擬定辦法，呈行政院核定，再呈國府明令公布。（六）該項債券，原則上擬充份運用公債政策，應予自由流通。惟何時可上市買賣，則尚待正式債劵印竣，方可付用。（七）按原則上任何國家發行公債後，其在市塲上流通之價格，恒低於票面。故即使美金債劵發行後，市慣或低於票面，此亦不足怪，更非顯示債信不强之謂云。</p>
<h3>米市價格續挺</h3>
<p>昨日南北市到米糧共計九千四百餘石，店方納胃加强，產區頻升，隨受影響。粳秈元米均一致續漲二三千元，麵粉亦因內地高昂，搬運不通，消化活絡，價格續挺千餘元。洋粉則再加二千元，麩皮四鄉銷路活發，軋升二千元左右。豆餅亦隨各物上漲，步一升一千三五百元。</p>
<p>油市店胃甚爽，重見回振，生油豆油及蔴油淸油，均一律上漲近萬元。黃豆油廠進胃頗貪，依然求過於供，漸　高翔。大豆漢貨均高一二子元，杜豆亦然緊俏。菉豆暫乏榮　，缸豆汕頭去化轉呆，回挫一二千元。</p>
<p>苞米到銷兩少，平定之格。紅糧　坊去路尚可，盤升千元／芝蔴洋莊蔴聯，軋升二三千元。生仁外埠本街去胃均見平淡，早疲午豎，無甚軒經。赤豆胃呆平渡，價　千元。</p>
<h3>多頭獲利出籠　外股堅後步降</h3>
<p>外股昨成交稍淸，證券帮中人供意較股，獲利多頭頗多出籠，缺乏給持，堅後步低。怡紗晨開三一三〇〇元，高價三一七〇〇元後，即告爭賣，午收回落至二九一〇〇元低價。午後稍見穩定，怡　略見生動外，和股均在低檔徘徊。結果與前收想較計業廣回跌一成弱，除均跌落半成强。</p>
<h3>華股大勢趨盤　美亞漲風獨勁</h3>
<p>華股昨美亞漲風仍勁，多方對永紗仍在待機加碼中，雖漲而多掙扎，不逮美亞遠甚，成交較多，業中大戶尚以觀望居多，趨勢多盤各漲半成，餘平平及微升不等。</p>
<p>晨開見高，開後形成盤局，二〇七號九七號一九八號七六號有供，九四號一一七號六九號有納，而告掙扎，後經一四五號一九八號三一號二三一號一六九號二一九號賣到二四二五元。美亞經二二三號一一七號力購而告俏利，九七號二三五號一六〇號七六號二號二二三號二四號一八〇號一九八號二三一號一〇二號四號均納，又逐漸拉高至二五七〇元，九五號九七號二一九號二〇七號一九八號一五四號一九七號脫手，降低至二五三〇元。四號一八叫號二二三號一四二號一六〇號一八三號買胃見强，遞永紗見二六〇〇元高價，六五號一四五號七六號一八三號二二六號一四二號趁勢紛紛了結，回低至二五〇〇元。一一七號一八五號均加吸納，臨收扳上至二五四〇元，收後喊高至二五七〇元。結果較前收計水紗中法升半成弱，信和華豐新光新華徵升，美亞漲一成不到，遞交計美亞升一成弱，永紗信和各漲半成弱，華豐新光微升，統益商務火柴</p>
<p>午後二一三號一四五號均進，遞永紗升為二五七〇元，二一五號一八五號一五三號六八號逢高了結，曾退至二五四〇元內。美亞漲勢仍勁，不久由二二三號抬高至停限，二二號二〇號三五號七一號一六九號均進，麗安漲停，遞永紗乃漲到二六一〇元·一九八號八四號一〇六號逢高脫手，退至二五七〇元，八九號一九七號二三一號四七號一四九號仍其買胃，終於扳高至二六四〇元，九七號四七號二〇二號一〇〇號七六號再加供給，降至二六〇〇元。一〇六號二三五號一八三號一〇七號　買，臨收再被拉上，遞美亞亦告漲停，收授稍低。結果較前收計美亞漲停，中法升一成　，水紗信和華豐新光各漲半成張，勸興新業　升。遞交計美亞漲停，永紗升一成不到，信和新光　　各漲半成，冷股　安漲停，統益火柴內衣各漲一成强，餘徽升迄半成不等。塲外股大生平平，餘均上升。</p>
<h3>決定運大豆十五萬包　食油原料有著落　市府今晨商討配銷問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油原料之供應，頃悉國行張總裁，巳允向東北方面，先洽運大豆十五萬包，供給本市榨油廠應用，預計可榨油三萬担。此事一俟呈請行政院核定，即可施行。又聞此後每月將經常由政府供給大豆十五萬包，以維本市食油之生產。食油議價。則仍維持不變，每担仍爲廿五萬元。聞吳市長爲商討食油之配銷問題，將於今日上午十時，在市府召集有關油商談話云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕經濟部長王雲五，對食油問題，極為重視，定今日由京來滬，半與有關學呢避會商遏止食油黑市猖獗有效辦法。</p>
<h3>統債閑散</h3>
<p>公債昨成交閑散，不到三百萬元。統丙晨開一三二〇〇元，高價一三八〇〇元八〇〇元，低　一二八〇〇元，最後在一三三〇〇元左右徘徊。結果較前收計甲乙丁成各升二三百元，統丙升七百元，大戶按兵不動，北帮稍售而已。</p>

<h3>協助茶商出口　準許增加押款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕擄悉：卅六年外銷茶葉貸款最大原則，係根據毛茶貸給精製貸款，然後憑箱茶叙做押匯，到達出口地點後，則可叙做質押借款。出口時，再憑信用證書，叙做打包貨款，凡此種種，皆在杜絕非茶商申請貸款。蓋貸款之第一階段，即需憑毛茶，始可申貸。貸款之最高限額，祁紅爲六十萬元，屯綠爲五十萬元，平絲爲四十萬元。至卅五年度之外銷茶葉，白因國庫不能負担收購之盈虧後，經濟部亦曾於一日函國行，略以收購外銷茶葉，不元與民爭利之嫌，故收購原案，終告撤銷。國行業於三日將撤銷收購原賽之事，函陳行政院，並分函中國農民銀行，中央信託局，及茶商查照。惟爲扶助各茶商出口計，允許各茶商自向中國農民銀行，加做　款。其限額以卅六年外銷茶葉預定押款限額人折計算。押款總額，約在二百億元以上。惟須扣還原押款。原押款祁紅爲三十五萬元，屯綠爲二十八萬元，平綠爲二十萬元，國去共押一百四十餘億元。現祁紅增爲四十八萬元，屯綠四十萬元，平綠三十二萬元，增加在七十餘億元之着。</p>
<h3>國際貨幣基金　具有兩種功能　美政府以一力支持</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國際貨幣基金我團代表顯　羣氏，三日由美國返抵上海，接見記者時稱：目下各國代表均返國向本國政府述職，本人此次除向政府報告之外，尚有要公接洽。惟接洽者爲何事，內容與性質如何，顧氏均不頻有所透露。但云大槪在國內有三四星期勾留，公畢即返美國。</p>
<p>顧氏表示：貨幣基金已於三月起正式工作，不過現在之作風很謹慣，因此「不大熱鬧」。截至此時爲止，各國認定的基金已先後繳付，匯率亦大都提出。現在尚未提出者，包括我國在內，當亦不致延遲過久。以基金之貢獻而論，可從兩方面去看：第一種功能是各國對外收支有短期的失衡時，其金可以帮助它；不過任同國家如果本身還有一點辦法者，都不會向基金借貸，而　意以自已之力量求其平衡。因此基金的作用，不啻是「第二準備」。基金之第二種功能，比較積極，尤其在目前更有意義。即各國代表可時時接獨，互相交換意見，研究各國金融財政上各問題，藉此增進瞭解和同情。此種辦法，石家莊能解瘊一些問題，而使國際經濟合作之展認，增中光明。</p>
<p>記者叩詢：自基金發起人羅斯福總統逝世後，美政府對於支持貨幣基金的實施，是否有充分熱情？顧氏表示：美政府不但有熱情，而且有具體的辦法，現在已經成立一個National　AovisoryCouncil，由財政部。國務院·商務部，聨邦準備銀行·進出口銀行·五機關首長擔任委員。對於在基金中工作之美方人員，予以直接指導，其重視之程度可見一班。至於蘇聨之熊度，前後初不一致，基金成立時會議她會參加，以後態度則趨於冷淡，基金未繳，會議亦不參加。但顧氏相信此係暫時之現象。</p>
<p>願氏認為如我國局勢趨於安定時，蒸金將對我大有帮助，目前有一好現象，即基金內各國代表，對於我國　服經濟困難之努力，寄以深切同情。對於我國未來之貨幣，顧氏有雨點主張：認爲我國應該參加國際合作，但同時本身必須有確定之貨幣政策。並稱，國際銀行前途極光明，有許多大計劃正在擬訂之中，對五億美元借款事則避而不談，認爲不屬於其職務範圍。</p>

<h3>江春二十年祭</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>江春於十六年四月三日去世，到今天整整二十年，我再不能不寫幾個字，來耙念他一下。</p>
<p>江春是我的同學，朋友，知交，如果情人不限於異性，他也是我的情人，總之，除了骨肉之外，人與人之間和我最親密的人！我嗜好文學，他也嗜好文學，和我共同發起「彌潇社」，我嗜好遊覽，他也嗜好遊覽；雖然他所嗜好的，例如拉梵啞林，並不樣樣都是我所嗜好的，但我們嗜好的，却似乎他都有興趣，譬如看足球，他的興趣並沒有我的高，却往往被我拉了和他的夫人一。和我去。……</p>
<p>我有困難，不必我說出口來，他早就爲我解決，安排好。最普通的，我沒有錢寄回家，他不必等我開口，或常他眞眞不知道時，至多對他說一聲，他一定就會借錢給我，借了從來不會問我索付，，我還給他時，他也不會不要。他眞正是一個緩急可恃的人！</p>
<p>尤其重要的，他在我的精神上不知給了多少安慰。二三十年前，我是一個善發牢騷的人，而所遭遇的，幾乎沒有一種不是拂意的。這並不是我的命遝不佳，實在我的脾氣不能從俗，而生活困難，又不能不向人有所週旋甚至請託，他竭盡了他言詞上的譬解，實際上的援助，使我安定以至奮發。我的話，說給別人聽，也許曾被輕忽，更可能會被恥笑，反對；但說給他聽，似乎就從來沒有一次不被重視和同意過。我的行動，當然更有許多人不以爲然的，但在他看來，似乎都是對的，當面對我是說贊成，背地也總說我不錯。一句話，在感情上，他對我有無條件的融洽！</p>
<p>管仲說，「生我者父母，知我者飽叔，」我不能不說，「生我者父母，知我者江春，」不幸，他在二十年前，以二十入歲正當有爲的年齡，却因傷寒症去世了！</p>
<p>但他去世後，我沒有寫過什麽來紀念他。在他的追悼會中，我沒有送過一字一句的聯幛。其他任何刋物上，我也沒有直接提到過他。這不是我不會寫，實在我不要寫。</p>
<p>不要寫的理由，當然不是根本不要寫，正是「藎有待也」。待什麽？待我能够暢快徹底地寫，待寫出來後馬上能够刋佈，傳之不久遠。任何敷衍塞責的寫，我不要。可是這樣一待就待了二十年！</p>
<p>在這二十年中，前十年我只困頓憔悴於生活的掙扎中，後十年，自從抗戰到現在，是個什麽時代，誰都知道，當然我還只是在掙扎中，我不能寫，寫了也不能刋佈。我只有待，待一個機會，待什麽奇蹟出現，可以償我的宿願。</p>
<p>現在，機會來了麽？沒有！奇蹟出現了麼？更沒有！但我覺得不能再待了：時世如此，「俟河之淸，知在何日！」而我自已，攬鏡自照，白髮即將盈額，埀埀老矣，還待什麽！</p>
<p>我已在暢快徹底地寫，已寫好我預計的五分之四，的六七十禺字，希望本年就可以寫好，寫好後，刋佈的機會當然沒有把握，能否傳之久遠，尤其渺茫。但我想：只要寫好，其他都不成問題：奇蹟是不會出現的，（例如那一個江春其他的好友，或任何人，會助成我這事，）而機會却總是有的。在我生前不能刋佈出去，也許我的子孫會給我刊佈出去，至少我的子孫總一直會將我所寫的這些紀念江春的手稿，保留下去，雖不遠，亦久矣。</p>
<p>我不再待了，我在他的二十年祭，先要寫這一篇小文來紀念他。實在他死得太寂寞了，在這二十年中，我沒有看見或聽見一個人，連他的家屬在內，對他有過什麽紀念的表示。我這篇小文固然沒有什麼大力量，正如我那百萬字的長篇，也不見得有什麽力量一般，但我總算對他盡了一些心。</p>
<p>二十年中，我無時無刻不紀念他，此後，我還是無時無刻不紀念他！這是我對他的真正紀念，不單在他這二十年祭的一天！</p>
<p>江春姓錢，字蓉孫，松江人，東吳大學法學士，會任商務印書館編譯多年，手創松江初級中學，爲松江上海景贤女子中學負責人之一。著述散見各刋物，我當為之收集，出一全集。</p>
<p>他與社會國家的關係，應該有人爲他寫；如果沒有，我也要另外爲他寫，這裏不贅。</p>
<h3>夾竹桃</h3>
<p>— 羅明</p>
<p>當我到這個屋子裹來的時候，我對這前面院子裏遮蔭的三枝夾竹挑就有些兒好感。以後我的桌子放在一個窗口，這個窗口的外面，正植着一校夾竹桃，每日閒來，我就憑窗望着它，看它在一陣微風裏擺動，或是掉下一二片絳色的花片。</p>
<p>朋友到我這裏來玩，也嘆賞着，說環境好。環境好者，因前有夾竹桃屏窗，後有菜園也。</p>
<p>不過我是並不對菜園有好感的，我喜歡這三株夾竹桃，它長得那樣高，高過了圍墻，它是那樣茂盛，而且是常綠著的，它矯健的挺立着，在枝頭上綻放了美麗的桃花似的花朶。可是並不柔媚，或是播送着芳香來討人的歡喜。它是寂寞的生長着的，在這個園子裏。</p>
<p>每天我爲這充滿着生命力的嫩芽底抽長而欣喜，當我　散地在園子裏踱着的時候，我常常撫摩着這綠色的葉子，我歡喜這個陰　的顏色，它像是奐徴著一個艱難中發育著的生命。</p>
<p>當冷雨黃昏之時，我是恒常深感孤寂，一盞昏黃的檯燈伴着我，燈絲燃發着幽微的光，散着幽微的熱。我靜靜地記下一天的生活，或是打開書册，以我呆滯的眼光在書頁上爬行。雨聲不時打斷的思緒，沉悶的氣忿使我窒息與煩燥起來。於是我打開百葉窗，一陣冷風吹來，將我從寥落中吹醒。向外望去，依稀地辨明園子中的一枝夾竹桃正在苦痛的搖　着。雨珠打響着葉子，鳴咽地在訴說，像被啓示般，我開始理解生命在寂寞中，在風雨中也是生長的。因此，我又安靜了下來，束起自己的感情，輕輕地關上窗子，準備休息，也準備起明日生活所需要的一份熱情。</p>
<p>未幾，秋盡冬至，夾竹桃衰頹起來了，葉子一片一片的飄下，飄得十分疏漏。然而仍然那麼鬰緣，枝頭的芽苗緊緊的包藏着，似乎準備與寒冬搏鬥。我也並不因舊的葉子的吹落而悲哀，國為芽苗沒有夭折，舊的死亡紙是新的成長開始。</p>
<p>又是嚴寒的日子，霜雪飛舞着，園子裏堆積了厚厚的雪。讓凍僵的身子烤在火爐邊，數著年歲，我想起祖父花白的鬍子，和母親咳嗆的夜晚，我埋沉在紛亂的苦憶中。抬起頭，我看到窗前蹬着的夾竹桃，它負荷了雪片，重累地壓彎了身子。祇是仍然那麼倔強，沒有萎黃了葉子，也沒有折壞腰肢，無言地承擋著冬天的襲擊。</p>
<p>我感到斸愧，我感到自己是那樣軟弱得可憐的，連一份生物的勇氣都沒有。我無能，我無能站在大風雪中，雖然我有着春天的信念，然而，冬天的日子是多麼令人難耐呀。</p>
<p>在這有爐火的室中，我終究挨過了這一個冬天，如今，早春復至，窗著的夾竹桃正在春風裏笑語着，苗芽已為春風物開而抽生了，蔥綠的葉　中漸漸地添增着新綠的幼葉。</p>
<p>我信守着，這不再是一個無花的春天，夾竹桃這象徵著堅強的生命底生物，它會盛開那象徵青春底可愛的花朵的。</p>
<p>一個春暖的清晨，我折下一枝夾竹桃的椏枝，把他插在案上，我像得到一份鼓勵。</p>
<h3>寒食與清明</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>寒食，據一般的傳說，是附會介子推焚身的故事。但據左傳和史記，並無介子推被焚之事。然而周禮所說：「今寒食准節氣，是仲春之末，淸明是三月之初。然而焚火，蓋周之舊制，不因子推也。」同時周禮也有一段稍爲含　的記載，說：「司炬氏仲春，以木鐸修火禁於國中，爲春季將出火也。」因為禁火綫寒火。寒食起於局代，這是一種的說明。</p>
<p>至介子綏抱木而焚死，晋文公哀之：通令國中在五月五日不得舉火來哀思他，這是琴操上說的。介之推與介子綏是否即是一人，五月五日，是否即現在淸明節的前一天，那就要考證了。</p>
<p>荊楚歲時紀載：「去冬節一百五日，即有疾風甚爾，謂之歲寒。」如此，則據曆算，是淸明的前兩天。但沈　期的寒食詩云：「嶺外逢寒食，春來不見晴。洛中新甲子，明日是淸明。」那麽，寒食是冬至後一百六天了。禁火期限，也有數說的不同，魏武帝明罰令；「冬至後百五日，皆絕火寒食。」後漢書：「周舉遷幷州刺史……春中寒食一月，老小不堪。」粼中記：「爲介子推斷火，冷食三日。」斷火百五日，對於飲食的不便，是不近人情，尤其是北方的寒冷地城。或說冬至後百五日，是指冬至後的第一百五十日的一天而已，並非一百五十日都絕火寒食的。好在這是民問傳說的歷史上名詞，只有舊體詩人把他作吟詠的資料，他的實際生命；早已斷絕的了。</p>
<p>淸明節來源很久了，最膾炙人口的一首詩，是杜牧的淸明詩：「淸明時節雨紛紛，路上行人欲斷魂！借問潤家何處有，牧童遙指杏花邨。」歐陽修的蝶戀花詞：「雨積風狂三月暮，門掩黃昏；無計留春住。淚眼問花花不語，亂紅飛過秋千去。」這是何等的　綿　　的詞句，使人感到寒食淸明的景象。</p>
<p>淸明掃墓，是最近幾百年間的習慣，並不是自古有之的禮祭。如蔡邕見靈帝到陵的時候，儀態軍然，對人說：「墓祭雖古無，亦不妨創設。」後來魏文晋宣，唐太常博士彭景直，唐紹都主張「墓祭菲三禮之所許，應實行禁革。」兩者各走極端。可是到了現在，掃墓，祭墓已成普遍的事，每逢春秋佳節，各地都有掃墓，到親友的境墓去憑弔一下，表示追思，這還是較正常的禮儀。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血308</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「當然緊張…」鶴見剪斷了正岩的話，「各人都準備升級發財，再要不乘勢把傢伙敲得響些，害怕戲台上不能出塲咧…」，鶴見冷笑着，「拿幾萬，幾十萬，幾百幾千萬人的姓命，來換他們的功名，這個買賣倒是很合算的！」鶴見表示十分償恨，沉吟了一會，又問正岩，「東京，瀋陽，有我們自己的消息嗎？」</p>
<p>「有的；『〇十二』和『〇二』特別注意時局的發展；長谷川請的消息就是『〇十二』發送來的。瀋陽方面，值得注意的，還是大軍往山西推進的一條；『〇二」說隊長已有移植幹綫的計劃…』</p>
<p>「是的，預飾移確北平的一部分，很有幾位新的好手，另外組織了一大帮人物、正在進行；力量十分强旺，供給也算充分。哦…』鶴見好像想起了什麽，一雙劍眉，蹙在一齊，同時瞧了瞧手錶，「咦…到哪裏去了呢？」</p>
<p>正岩不知道鶴見問的什麽人，沒敢回答。鶴見從座位裏一躍站起，在地上起那張怪字條，遞給正岩，「解說得出來嗎？」一面又開了房門，拍着雙掌。鶴見因見這裏一切，大部分部是日本舊式佈置，所以也用舊式方法，招呼下女。</p>
<p>下女並沒應　聲而來。抹正岩本來瞧着那張字條在出神，忽然悟到鶴見擊掌，是要招呼下女，便立從椅上躍身起來，四下掃射了一眼，見門捺側電燈開　處，有一隻電鈴擊鈕，便上前捺了一兩下，仍舊瞧　那張怪字條：</p>
<p>「華鬰飯店是西人開設的大飯店之一」。</p>
<p>「在什麽地方？」鶴見瞧着林正岩，但神色上顯然有些不自在。</p>
<p>「在中區，外灘大馬路口上」，正岩應聲而答，「這個號碼，倒是奇怪，可絕對與飯店沒有關係。」</p>
<p>「何以見得？」</p>
<p>「上海任何路沒有這個號碼，任何居宅區或旅社房間，也不會有這號碼，—沒有「〇」字起頭的奇怪號碼。」林正岩很絕斷似的。</p>
<p>「哈…除了房宅號碼以外，還有其他見解嗎？」鶴見追問。</p>
<p>「時怕推想不出…這字條可是那位同隊長同來的小姐留下的嗎？」正岩把字條，很謹愼地安放在桌子上。</p>
<p>「哦…我忘了告訴你；」鶴見三兩句語，簡短的把早晨下船時的情形說明了。</p>
<p>「這個，我可以託一位朋友去打聽。他恐怕可以解釋…」</p>
<p>鶴見剛要問明這朋友是誰，却發見那個下女已經站在門外了。</p>
<p>「請進來」，鶴見對那下女點着頭，「我想請問你一件事，就是：中村小姐回來沒有？」」鶴見的語句，有此羅嗦，可見心思亂了。</p>
<p>「沒有，…」下女好像很抱歡似的。</p>
<p>「我知道，你可聽見中村小姐說明上什麼地方去？」</p>
<p>那下女還在追想似的，林正岩却插口說：</p>
<p>「我倒聽見那位…中村小姐，好像是問過下面的管事，「汽車到大使館要多少時間？…筆懋飯店離大使館有多少路程？」等等」。</p>
<h3>與舊上海競爭</h3>
<p>— 葉林</p>
<p>許多人慶幸着這一决戰爭，沒有對上海過份嚴重的損害。其實這是短視的說法，這一次戰事打盡了都市的建設，使我們的都市在建設一停就是十年，而且現在還是在半停頓狀態中的這十年，使我們的都市在今天造成了「擠」和「亂」的現象。</p>
<p>本來「擠」和「亂」是可以以都市的立體與平面的建設和發展來克服的，然而，在今天，我們誰也不敢與不能作這樣的奢望。因此，雖則這是一個大都會，而曠地還存在在市區內，因此，雖則這是一個不夜城，而破落的鄕村就在街的盡頭，郊區的四週。誰都會覺得這樣的都市，這樣的都市底繁榮是建築在少數人奢侈的享受，和衆多的失業者身上的。</p>
<p>也因此，我們的都市不能保持秩序上的安寗，和狀態的平衡，房荒造成了工　B.貧血，窄道凍住了行人與車輛，不景氣使工廠關門，員工失集，高物價形成了一個不可避免的現象：是百貨公司門庭的冷落，門售數字不能隨着物價比例的上升，因爲，失業，指數的凍結，一般待遇的微薄，限制了購買力。</p>
<p>在戰前，租界存在時，紫局有一個維心，建立新的市中心，减低與削弱租界的地位和價值，現在，租界收回了，市政府還入了中心區，競爭似乎無須再行存在，事實上，競爭是應該更深更廣的，因爲我們的都市面臨着危機，應該與「擠」與「亂」與房荒，與太窄的街道，與太多的車輛失事，與工商業的不景氣，與二三百萬人的失業現象來一决更大的競爭。</p>
<p>這一次競爭勝利了，才眞正是大上海的勝利。</p>

<h3>談法治</h3>
<p>— 馨</p>
<p>最近教接到一包由美國寄來的書，用一張舊報紙包着，打開一看原來是一九四三年九月二十九日的紐約論壇報，在不受人注意的後頁角落裏，登載一段新聞</p>
<p>「本市皇后匾拿含街二〇三三號之老婦克和茜夫人，於一九四一年三月十二日前往中村之克利夫納公園遊玩。是日適值大雪，夫人因雪滑，跌倒路旁，傷右腿筋骨，經醫院治療，半年後才痊愈。出院後，即請律飾向法院控告紐約市政府，忽職不掃街道，以致跌傷行人，故要求賠償損失。此案訴訟年餘，迭經審訊，至昨日，皇后區高等法院才宣告判決，認爲夫人之控告完全合理，市政府應賠償夫人之損失費一萬二千五百元美金。又因夫人在醫院養病期間內，其丈夫失去夫人之家庭勞役，此項家庭生活之損失費二千五百元美金，亦應由市政府賠償之。</p>
<p>高等法院判決此案所根據的理由是：人民納稅給市政府，主要的目的是要市政府維持市內的治安，街道的淸潔和市民的安全，市政府不打掃街道，以致跌傷行人，這是市政府的過失，所以應該負責賠償。</p>
<p>這在美國人看來是一件很平常的事情，否則不會把這新聞登在不受人注意的地方，然而在我們看來，却是一椿很出奇的新聞。</p>
<p>法治不祗是呌人民守法，而且是要政府守法，人民犯法自然要受法律的制裁，政府也是一樣的。美國政治儘管有許多黑幕，但確確實實尊重人民權利。</p>
<h3>兩和尚</h3>
<p>— 玄石</p>
<p>靜安寺兩和尚德悟與密迦，因漢奸罪而各判徒刑二年六個月。某夜報在判決書後面還加了一句「酌留家屬生活費用」。這大概是由於同樣的東西寫得多了，所以不自覺地拖了這麼一筆。其實兩個和尚（在判決書上）並無家屬，因而他們的財產，可說是例外地全部被沒收了。</p>
<p>和尚旣然出家，當然沒有家屬。然而在這個社會裏面，要眞正出家實在也不容易。不守淸規和畜妻室的和尚，且不去說它，就說那些眞正光桿兒的和尚，又何嘗能做到出家。即如上面兩個和尚，他們雖無眷屬，却也有私房的財產，有了私產，當然有在家人所有的一切欲望與煩惱，名日出家人，其實却未嘗走出家的圈子。</p>
<p>這還是小焉者的說法。出家人四大皆空，而現實終是現實，無法逃避。他們能逃出家庭的小家，終逃不出國家的大家。上面兩個和尚，在國家多難的時候，他們就無法不受到影響。祗因他們走了違反國策的路，就變成了兩個漢奸。同樣如太虛法師，他也是出家人，他同樣跳不出國家的圈子。可是他走的却是全國朝野所同走的路綫，因而他成爲抗戰的英雄。有人稱他爲政治和尚，其實處此時代，要和政治不發生關係，並無多大的可能。和尚猶且如此，我們非和尚的俗家人更然。</p>

<h3>「黑夜到天明」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>近來許多片子都把地下工作者描寫成新的英雄，這部「黑夜到天明」中的主角注德，一個地下工作者，抗戰時，他在淪陷區內從事破壤漢奸與敵僞合作，被捕後帶了同夥越獄逃亡，勝利後領導着一羣難民從事修築公路，剷除土劣，努力鄉村建設，但是我們觀一翻報紙，時常出現在我們面前的那些自稱地下工作者，則又是怎樣一副抹着白鼻子的小丑嘴臉呀！</p>
<p>我們不否認戰時地下工作者對祖國抗戰的貢獻，但是在這個劇本中，作者對汪德的描寫就太神化了。他的逃出敵人的監獄，恰巧會逃入漢奸黃逸民的家裏，（就是報告敵人，使他被捕的告密者）而且又會闖入他女兒的房間裏，當敵人進房來搜查時，竟會沒有發現，可是畫面上敵人敲了很久房門，汪德才把門打開，，而此時漢奸的女兒却姑在距房門很遠的窗邊，那末開門的又是誰，敵人會沒有發現可疑之點嗎？接着是敵兵隊長進來求歡，被汪德用花瓶打死了，難道房門外面的翻譯等，會一點不聽到房內的聲音嗎？這一切都沒法使觀衆相信它的可能。而劇情的安排，也是處處巧合，不免减弱了這故事的眞實性。</p>
<p>漢奸的女兒黃慕蘭隨注德逃走後，竟成了一個前進的女孩子，勝利後勉「白天替大家管孩十，晚上還要當老師敎大家唸書，」然而出現在畫面上，她那漂亮時髦的服裝，又誰能相信她是深入民間的工作者。</p>
<p>總之這裏只誇張的表揚了個人英勇，沒有廣大的民衆力量。但是在作者筆下的那個漢奸，後來竟搖身一變，又出任勝利後的鄕長，爲非作歹，這個人物的安排，却是全劇最好的一筆了。</p>
<p>以「天字第一號」全班人馬演出作號召，顯然這個戲是失敗了。故事的鬆散，導演處理全劇的軟弱，都是註定了這個戲的命運。</p>
<h3>清明節語</h3>
<p>— 飛塵</p>
<p>中國人數千年來受着儒佛的影響、以爲「爲人之十」者，必須盡「孝道」，如若對先輩「生時」未能「奉養」盡心，那麽「死後」必定設法「耀祖揚宗」。</p>
<p>淸明時節之遄返祖瑩爲先祖「掃墓」，也便是光耀門楣炫揚鄉里的之一種。</p>
<p>但當這廿世紀五十年代裏，這班兒孫們翻滾在歷史的巨流裏，有些人在戰爭裏，在失業浪潮裏，失落了田勝，燬壤了家園，面對着靑草蔞蔞的社塋，將如何泗涕橫流！</p>
<p>有些人在戰爭中，雖然戴上了出賣民族的冠冕，但識時務者爲俊傑，依然冠蓋還鄕，衣錦榮歸。祖　　下有知，面對如此兒孫，將是憤怒還是羞愧？</p>
<p>有些兒女們，這十年來，衣不暖，食不　　　　　　　，困頓半生；今朝得以　伏祖先的靈前，他們　　　　哭，遙是飲泣無聲？</p>
<p>如若今日的「淸明節」仍然是「苦雨悽厲」，則路上大半的兒孫，都將爲着生活，爲着前程，欲泣無淚吧。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>這些情形蘭自已都沒有告訴過老祝，而是老祝從徐紹明夫婦和緋緋的說話裏探聽到的。</p>
<p>小巷裏的紛擾漸漸平息了，可是外面六合路上早又是車水馬龍的景象；隔着一個大院子，老祝可以不斷塊聽到車聲鄰鄰，人聲嚷嚷。</p>
<p>他獨自坐在竹榻上沉思着，一時竟想不出什麽好的辦法；他吁了一口氣，跳起來，披上黃卡其的夏威夷衫，順手從衣袋裏掏出一顆太妃糖，放到了嘴裏去，一面取起桌上的冷水瓶，一連喝了三四口。</p>
<p>「5111……」他從一這又窄又破的小木梯上走下去，不自覺地又吹起口哨來。</p>
<p>小學校　僅剩的一個校工還沒有起身，他自已打開大門，走到了街上去。</p>
<p>靑灰色的曉色照遍了桂林城郊內外，山還是那麽淸，水還是那麽秀，然而人却是這樣的亂！走完六合路，折到建幹路，他眼前所見到的簡直已成了人，車子，貨物和行李所積聚成的一片汹湧的動的海。沒有一個人不在慌慌張張地奔，沒有一輛車子不高高地滿載着各色各樣的東西。老祝心裏一冷，覺得這景象眞有些不祥。</p>
<p>東江區的那些精美無比的小洋房裹都亂成了一片，好好的花圃踐踏得不知所云</p>
<p>「好吧！可憐的人兒。再積聚吧！再搜括吧！再亨樂吧！看你們到那一天才覺悟！」他，一個幹戲劇的窮光蛋，這時候倒真覺得自己是世界上最幸福的人了！沒有家庭，沒有財產，沒有貨，也沒有永遠填不滿的貪慾；現在可以冷冷地看着道些平日昏天黑地，利慾　心的家伙，像喪家之犬那樣的狼狽地逃竄出去。</p>
<p>過了東江大橋，他站在橋堍，正遲疑着不能決定應該先上那裏去的時候，忽然聽到有女人的聲音在呌他；他還沒有來得及回頭去看，一輛外表不很新的小包車已開到了他面前。</p>
<p>一個滿頭鬈發的女人從車子里一躍而下，老祝覺得眼前一亮。原來就是金愛麗。三天不見，金愛麗已變了個樣兒了；原是很敝蘭的衣衫，已換上了挺鮮明的新裝，精神也顯得振作了許多。眉　眼角，很透着幾分喜氣。</p>
<p>「老祝，上那兒去？」她很嬌媚地向他一笑，本來還想伸出手來和老祝握一下，但立刻似乎又想到車上還有個司機在注視着，便臨時縮了回去。（三）（五）</p>

<h3>Between Jinan, Tai'an, and Dawenkou, Various National Army Units Divide and Deploy; Victory Reported in Northern Henan, Warfare Approaching Conclusion</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 4th] The National Army's Wang Jingjiu Corps has entirely reached Tai'an and its surrounding areas. Currently, it is simultaneously commencing local pacification work and making new military deployments to conduct a planned pursuit of the Communist forces in Xintai and Laiwu. In the area east of Tai'an, the Communist forces have again gathered over 20,000 troops, seemingly with the intent to counterattack. The National Army has taken strict precautions. The Ou Zhen and Tang Enbo Corps have also been actively advancing towards the outer perimeter of the Yimeng Mountain area in recent days, aiming to resolve the main force of the Communist forces in the mountainous region with a steady and solid encircling strategy.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] The National Army, advancing from Sishui towards Mengyin in southern Shandong, recovered Anluzhuang, Caojiazhuang, and Shijiazhuang, located over 20 kilometers southwest of Mengyin, on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] The mop-up operation in the central section of the Jinpu Railway was successfully completed on the 4th. National Army units converged between Dawenkou and Tai'an, and between Tai'an and Jinan. There were no traces of Communist forces along the way.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 4th] The Communist forces on the north bank of the Yellow River, outside Jinan, have been quite busy with troop movements in recent days. Approximately 7,000 to 8,000 Communist troops have been deployed north of Yancheng, seemingly eyeing Yancheng and Sangzidian.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] Following the great victory of the National Army in northern Henan, in an attempt to reverse the decline, Communist commander Liu Bocheng personally led the First, Second, Third, Sixth, and Seventh Columns, along with the Independent Fourth Brigade and the New Fifth Brigade, totaling approximately 70,000 troops, to invade Xinxiang along the north bank of the Yellow River on March 26th. Their objective was to destroy the Yellow River Railway Bridge and breach the Yellow River embankments. On the 26th, they captured our Yanjin and continued to advance westward. On the 28th, their First and Seventh Columns fiercely attacked the Zhongyi Army station and the Yellow River Railway Bridge, while their Second, Third, and Sixth Columns, the Independent Fourth Brigade, the Fifth Brigade, and the Seventeenth Division, the Independent First Brigade, the Independent Second Brigade, and the New Twelfth and Thirteenth Brigades of the Taihang Military Region, besieged Xinxiang and Jixian. The defending troops valiantly counterattacked, engaging in five days and nights of bloody battle. The Communist forces suffered heavy casualties, and the remnants scattered in disarray towards Huaxian and the Taihang Mountain area. The National Army is currently pursuing and expanding the victory. The Second and Sixth Columns of the Communist forces were nearly wiped out, the Third Column suffered over 3,000 casualties, and the First and Seventh Columns suffered over 4,000 casualties. In total, the Communist forces suffered over 20,000 casualties, with over 2,000 captured. The National Army seized over 1,000 rifles and numerous other war spoils.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Kaifeng Dispatch, 4th] In the ten-day battle in northern Henan, the National Army achieved victory, attaining the originally planned strategic objectives. Yangwu, Yuanwu, Fengqiu, Yanjin, and other counties were successively recovered in a single day. Currently, the warfare in northern Henan is approaching its conclusion. The 40,000-strong invading force of Communist commander Liu Bocheng's troops gained nothing and has now abandoned their armor and dragged their weapons away. The National Army is currently clearing up the aftermath. There are no traces of Communist forces on either side of the Pinghan Railway line in the area. The Railway Bureau is working day and night to expedite repairs, and traffic should be restored within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Zhengzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Liu Bocheng troops of the Communist forces, retreating from the Pinghan Railway line in northern Henan, were fleeing in groups of three to five towards the area north of Huaxian on the 2nd and 3rd. Currently, there are no traces of Communist forces in the Changyuan area. Telephone service between Xinxiang and here was restored on the 4th. According to a telegram from Qixian, the results of this battle were extremely significant. The Communist casualties were confirmed to be over 10,000. It is reported that Liu Bocheng has ordered the reorganization of his seven columns into three columns. The National Army also captured over 600 Communist soldiers, seized 12 artillery pieces, over 50 light and heavy machine guns, over 300 rifles, and a large quantity of other military supplies.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 4th] The Communist atmosphere in the Anhui-Henan border area remains tense. In the Feihekou area southwest of Haoxian, there are over 2,000 troops under Wei Fenglou; in the Zaotianji area northwest, there are over 2,000 troops under Li Changyin; and in the Guanyintang area southeast, there are over 200 troops under Li Haoran.

<h3>National Army Recaptures Dingbian City, Dealing a Fatal Economic Blow to the Chinese Communists; National Army in Southern Suiyuan Pursuing Towards Pianguan</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The right wing of the National Army on the eastern route in northern Shaanxi occupied Lijiacuan, southeast of Suide, on the 3rd. The left wing, bypassing the western foot of Jiuli Mountain, also approached Nangoucha. Fighting is fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xi'an Dispatch, 4th] The Ningxia National Army recovered Dingbian County seat at 1:00 AM on the 4th. The Communist police regiment and units of unknown numbers were stationed inside the city. After a fierce battle, the entire police regiment was annihilated. The remaining Communists fled eastward. Pursuit is currently underway. Furthermore, the National Army captured Wayaobao at noon on the 3rd and is continuing to advance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Ningxia Dispatch, 4th] The National Army attacking Dingbian defeated the elite troops of the Communist forces at noon on the 3rd and continued to attack the city at 5:00 PM. The Communist forces stubbornly resisted. It was not until 11:00 PM that the National Army entered the city. After an hour of intense street fighting, the National Army completely recovered Dingbian County seat.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] In the battle of Dingbian City, the head of the Communist police regiment, Guo Binshan, and two other officers named Rong Sheng were killed. The National Army captured over 400 Communist soldiers and seized eight mortars, over 40 light and heavy machine guns, and a radio station.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Dingbian County seat, newly recovered by the National Army, was the base for the Communist forces' harassment of the Ikh Juu League. Geographically, it is also one of the most important of the three "bians" (i.e., Dingbian, Anbian, and Jingbian). In the past, merchants gathered here, mostly those engaged in Mongolian business. Since the Communist forces occupied it, it has declined drastically. Dingbian belongs to Shaanxi Province, located on the edge of the Great Wall and bordering Yanchi County in Ningxia. The two cities are 60 li apart and are both salt-producing areas in the border region. The two counties have a total of five large salt lakes, which are extremely abundant. It is reported that four-fifths of the total expenditure of the Communist Yan'an puppet government in 1942 and 1943 relied on this abundant salt production. Therefore, the successive recovery of Yanchi and Dingbian is a fatal blow to the Communist economy.</p>

According to him, it is unlikely that the Communist forces in Hebei will make any major moves.

The war spirit in the provincial capital has subsided, and grain from the countryside is being transported in continuously, and the market is gradually becoming prosperous.</p>
<h3>Press Delegation Arrives in Yan'an Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Yan'an Dispatch, 4th] A press delegation of Chinese and foreign reporters arrived in Yan'an on the 4th after its recapture to visit this place that has been occupied by the Communist Party for thirteen years. The 60 of us, accompanied by Chief of Staff Sheng Wen of the Garrison Headquarters and others, departed from Xi'an at 8:30 AM in three planes and flew north. We arrived in Yan'an at 9:47 AM, a flight of 67 minutes. When the plane first took off, looking down from the sky, we saw the crisscrossing fields of the Guanzhong Plain stretching endlessly. After half an hour, we entered the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi, where we saw undulating hills, intersecting gullies, terraced fields on the plains, and cave dwellings scattered irregularly along the mountains, which showed the difficult lives of the residents. Finally, when we discovered Yan'an among the mountains, we were overwhelmed with emotions. At that time, the plane slowly descended at the newly repaired airfield next to Pagoda Hill. After getting off the plane, we saw Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, Gu Xiping, Director of the Political Department of the Garrison Headquarters, Deputy Director Wang Chaofan, Deputy Commander of the Xi'an Garrison Zhao Caibiao, Deputy Director of the General Staff Office Liu Qingceng, and County Magistrate Bai Chongxu of [Shi] Shi County, all welcoming us at the airfield. We then took cars through Yanchuan to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government of the Communist Party to rest, and we stayed there. This was the highest administrative organ of the Communist Party in northern Shaanxi. The houses were all cave-style mansions built of brick and stone, quite grand and impressive. All the equipment was complete and intact, which proves that the Communist army was in a hurry to retreat and did not have time to destroy it. After a short rest, we gathered in the office of the "Border Region Government" to listen to Chief of Staff Sheng report on the details of the recapture of Yan'an, which lasted an hour. After lunch, we visited the airfield and the National Army's battle achievements near Yan'an, and then visited the important organs and residences of the Communist Party. We returned to our lodging at sunset.</p>

<h3>Breakwater in Keelung: Port Authority Is Designing Repairs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Keelung Dispatch, 4th] A section of the Keelung Port breakwater, which was destroyed by bombing during the war, is 35 meters long, 14 meters wide, and 7 meters high.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Planning to Solicit Business Shares for Enemy and Puppet Salt Industry Assets; Considering Levying a One-Time Property Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Ministry of Finance is planning how to solicit business shares for the assets of the enemy and puppet salt industry. It is heard that a gradual promotion method will be adopted, and the government will still hold half of the shares for the sake of transition. Scattered enemy and puppet salt industry assets in Shandong, Lianghuai, and Hainan will be entirely transferred to private operation. The enemy and puppet salt industry assets in the three regions of Northeast, Changlu, and Taiwan will be assigned to the China Salt Industry Corporation. The original plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan to openly solicit shares in the form of stocks, with private shares limited to 50%. The assets in these three regions are estimated to be worth between 55 billion and 60 billion yuan. It is said that the total capital of the China Salt Industry Corporation is set at 80 billion yuan, with the government and businesses each holding half. Of the 40 billion yuan raised from business shares, 15 billion to 20 billion yuan will be deposited into the treasury, and 25 billion to 20 billion yuan will be retained as the company's working capital. Business shares will be paid in installments, and the company can be established legally when half of the shares have been paid. After the company is established, the stocks can be allowed to be auctioned on the exchange and can be mortgaged to facilitate circulation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The central government has recently been considering levying a one-time property tax in order to balance this year's budget. The plan for the levy of the one-time property tax is being drafted by the Ministry of Finance. The scope of the levy will be: (1) Urban land and rural non-cultivated land owned by the same owner exceeding 50 mu, (2) Urban houses with a current value of more than 30 million yuan per building, (3) Foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens deposited at home and abroad, (4) Profitable business assets of more than 30 million yuan. In addition, a one-time excess property tax will be levied on individuals whose total assets currently exceed 500 million yuan and legal entities whose net assets exceed 500 million yuan. However, publicly owned property that has been verified may be exempted from the one-time property tax.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Regarding the issue of using the assets of foreign exchange deposits of Chinese citizens, it is heard that the Ministry of Finance has inquired about the opinions of the British and American governments and has been negotiating through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, recently, the Financial Counselor of the British Embassy in China, Thomas, and the American Embassy in China have replied to the Ministry of Finance, saying that they are instructed by their respective governments and are unable to assist due to legal restrictions. Therefore, the authorities are now trying to persuade Chinese citizens to voluntarily convert their foreign exchange deposits into US dollar bonds or use them to import machinery and raw materials that are currently needed in China, or to use foreign currency to deposit them in national banks. If they still fail to comply after the deadline, the government will investigate and punish them based on confidential reports.</p>

<h3>Uchida Takayuki's Heinous Crimes Are Obvious; War Crimes Tribunal Files Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The war criminal Uchida Takayuki (commander of the Japanese 70th Division) has recently been publicly prosecuted by the prosecutors of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense. The indictment is over 4,000 words long. The following is a record of his criminal facts:</p>
<p>Uchida Takayuki is a native of Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from the Japanese Army University and held various military positions, rising from infantry colonel to lieutenant general. He was a fierce and skilled Japanese general. In December 1937, he led his 16th Regiment to invade China and participate in the Battle of Taiyuan. Afterwards, he fought in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi area, such as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign in May 1942, the Guangde Campaign in September 1943, the Quzhou Campaign in June 1944, and the Lishui Campaign in August of the same year. Uchida Takayuki supervised the battles on the battlefield and personally participated in them. Wherever his troops went, they indiscriminately slaughtered people, subjected non-military personnel to torture and malicious starvation, and forced them to engage in work related to the enemy's military operations. The various atrocities are countless. For example, on January 11, 1943, the troops stationed in Fenghua fatally shot Xu Ying, a resident passing through the Wenchang Bridge, hitting a vital point. In December, the troops stationed in Wuxing successively shot 14 residents, including Huang A Yao, in Xinshi, Xilin Yan, Jintai Xiang, Yangjia Village, Baima Xiang, Yunqiao, and other places; Tan Shunpu and another person were captured and stabbed to death with bayonets on the shore of Taihu Lake, and their bodies were never found; Zhou Zifeng and other five people in Enze Xiang, Manyuan Dou, Xilin Xiang, Yigao, Mayao, Zhenze, and other places, were forced to lead the way but did not comply and were confined and starved to death; Zhu of Yunqiao in Hongcheng Xiang was driven into the river and drowned; Wu A Da was captured to the Wuzhen area and shot to death. In March and May of the same year, the troops stationed in Yuyao successively subjected Rong Siquan and Wang Wenkun, two residents, to either burning their faces with fire and stabbing their limbs with knives before throwing them into the river to their deaths, or arresting them to Henghe Street and stabbing them to death with sharp knives, abandoning their bodies for two days before they could be buried. On June 21 and July 11 and 12, the troops stationed in Xiaoshan killed residents Chen Zhang and vendors Shen Chunmu, Shen Zhangyuan, Shen A Jin, and other three people in Boshan Chen and Qian Qing in Yu Xi Xiang for no reason. On April 15, the troops stationed in Hangzhou forced Zhou A Zhen, a civilian laborer, to lead the way because of a summer sweep, but he did not comply and was dragged to Taicang Xiang and stabbed to death with a bayonet, and his body was thrown into the river; on May 1, Lang Wenhuan, a resident, was captured to Yinzi Ling in Dalu Xiang after injuring his leg, and was stabbed to death with a bayonet. He forced a traveling monk to lead the way, but he did not get his wish, so he was taken to Shishuo in Yuhang, subjected to torture, and starved to death. On August 6, Yu Yongsheng, a KMT intelligence officer, was buried alive on the Tucheng of Baoguo Temple, and resident Zhou Gengsheng was forced to pull a cart for him, but he was stabbed in the abdomen with a sharp blade because he did not understand the language, and his internal organs flowed out and he died. On May 3, 1944, the troops stationed in Zuoyi captured Shen Fuli, a civilian, from Hengjie in Wuyang Zhen, subjected him to torture, took him to Bailing Cave, and killed him with a quick knife. On June 16, Xu Xinfu, a resident, was tied up and forced to work in the Lutan official residence, and was subjected to torture and was covered in injuries. He was then abandoned in the fields. His father led him back, and he vomited blood and died. On September 24 of the same year, the troops stationed in Yongkang killed 12 residents, including Lü Congxin, in Paixi in Dachuan Xiang, Yazhuang, Yingcun, Changtian, Shaotong, and other places in Dexi Xiang because they could not escape the Japanese army's sweep. Moreover, wherever their troops went, they burned, looted, and raped women. For example, Huangdian Side on Yangming Road in Nanchang and Lingying Bridge in Baihuazhou, and the area around the county government and the Jiangdong Temple Fuzhou Gate, were burned and destroyed in 1939, reaching 1,288 buildings. The Hong family in Jinhua Xiang was looted in its entirety on December 29, 1944, suffering heavy losses. An octagonal pavilion on the Lianpodai slope under the Shangqiao Xiang Mountain in Fenghua, a historical building with hundreds of years of history, was set on fire and burned to ashes on January 19, 1943.

<h3>Withdrawal of U.S. Army Personnel from the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping Complete Next Tuesday; General Gillem to Return to the U.S. on the Same Ship</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 3rd] The withdrawal of U.S. Army personnel from the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping will be completed when the transport ship General Weigel leaves China on April 9th. Only a small number of personnel will remain to handle closing tasks. A special train will depart Peiping on April 8th, carrying passengers of the General Weigel. The list of departing personnel includes officers and soldiers of the 332nd Air Transport Squadron and the 701st Military Police Battalion of the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping. With this departure, all remaining personnel of the Military Police Battalion will be completely withdrawn and relocated to their new post in Shanghai. General Gillem, commander of the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping, and his family will also leave on the General Weigel. Most passengers on the ship will return to the United States, except for one corporal, twenty-six soldiers (assigned to the U.S. Army Graves Registration Service in China), and eighty-four officers and soldiers of the 701st Military Police Battalion, who will disembark in Shanghai. The U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping will be closed at midnight on April 8th. The U.S. military warehouse in Peiping will be maintained for a considerable period under the direction of Colonel Ward, U.S. Chief of Staff of the former Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, to dispose of all remaining supplies in accordance with U.S. Army regulations. The remaining personnel will consist of twenty-five officers and twenty-three soldiers. The first group of U.S. military personnel arrived in Peiping in early January 1946 to assist in the establishment of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation. Later, due to the expansion of tasks, the U.S. Military Headquarters in Peiping was organized to assist in the execution of U.S. supply matters. After the United States withdrew from the Chinese mediation agency, the U.S. Military Headquarters declared its mission complete, and its closing work began on February 7, 1947, when the General Weigel first left China. The General Weigel is currently anchored outside the breakwater of Qinhuangdao Port, loading luggage and cargo, and passengers will board the ship at Tanggu.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jiaxiang Arrives in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Negotiations for the Takeover of Dalian are Underway</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command, left Nanjing at 9:10 AM on the 4th aboard an air transport squadron plane to return to Shenyang. He was accompanied by Zhang Tingmeng, Commander of the First Air Force District, and several others.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] Zhao Jiaxiang returned to Shenyang by special plane at 4:00 PM on the 4th. It is said that information about Dalian must be requested before it can be released.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] According to reliable sources, the restoration of the administration of Lushun and Dalian has reached the final stage. Our side will proceed by both land and sea routes. It is reported that the Soviet side has agreed to this method. Furthermore, the central government will soon send official documents to this area regarding this matter.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] It is learned that the difficulties in taking over Dalian, in addition to the interference from the Communist forces, include other issues that need to be resolved through diplomatic means. For example, according to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the wharves of the Free Port of Dalian are to be jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union. However, it is reported that the Soviet side intends to retain the well-equipped facilities and hand over the dilapidated and unusable ones to our country, which is one such issue. At the same time, when Japan initially surrendered, White Russians in Dalian signed contracts with Japanese residents, acquiring ownership of most of the real estate. Therefore, if our country recognizes the validity of such contracts after taking over Dalian, what we would receive would be little more than an empty city, which is another issue. It is reported that the relevant authorities are actively negotiating with the Soviet side on the above two issues.</p>

<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Answers Reporters' Questions, Accuses the United States of Interfering in Greek Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Moscow, 4th (Broadcast): Molotov issued his first statement on the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 4th, which was reviewed by Stalin beforehand.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Disregarding the protests of other countries in the Far Eastern Commission, the United States today issued an "interim directive" to MacArthur, instructing him to immediately begin distributing Japanese war reparations materials. This directive will still be reviewed by the Far Eastern Commission, but because the United States is one of the countries with veto power, it cannot be changed unless the U.S. agrees. According to diplomatic officials, this is the first time the United States has taken such drastic action, which is beneficial to China and other countries that suffered from the war and was supported by Canada, China, the Netherlands, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>At today's discussion in the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet Union, France, India, Australia, and other countries opposed it, while Britain did not participate in the debate. The State Department held a closed-door meeting today and then released the full text of a statement by McCoy, the U.S. representative to the Far Eastern Commission, making the progress clear. McCoy told the committee that on February 13, the U.S. government had submitted to the commission a plan to immediately begin distributing Japanese reparations, and the United States believed that starting to transport reparations materials was an urgent task. McCoy pointed out that the start of transporting Japanese reparations had been delayed for more than a year, and then announced the U.S. "interim directive" for MacArthur's decision.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 3rd] At a meeting of the Far Eastern Commission today, U.S. Representative General McCoy issued a statement stating: "The U.S. government has decided to issue an interim order to the occupation authorities in Japan, authorizing MacArthur to immediately transport a portion of industrial equipment to several war-torn countries for early reparations. China will receive 15 percent of the total, the Philippines 5 percent, the Netherlands 5 percent (on behalf of the Dutch East Indies), and the United Kingdom 5 percent (on behalf of Burma, Malaya, and other colonies). Under this early reparations item, the United States will receive nothing."</p>
<p>It is estimated that this compensation will involve 1,000 factories, which can be divided into ten major categories, the main parts of which are steel, shipbuilding, thermal power plants, machinery, aviation industry, army and navy arsenals, and some chemical industries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] Regarding the immediate distribution of Japanese reparations, the "interim directive" issued by the United States to MacArthur is based on the regulations of the Far Eastern Commission, which stipulate that in the event of an emergency and the commission has not yet decided on a policy, the United States has the right to issue an interim directive and handle the matter first, and then submit it to the commission for review afterward.</p>
<h3>U.S. Decisive Action: To Confront the Soviet Union; Level of Contention Similar to the German Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Regarding the distribution of Japanese reparations, the United States has taken action today to confront the Soviet Union. All indications are that there will be a struggle, the intensity of which will be the same as the struggle currently underway at the Moscow Conference over the issue of German reparations. Of the 1,000 Japanese factories, the United States, disregarding Soviet opposition, intends to immediately ship 300 of them to China, the Philippines, and the Eastern territories of Britain and the Netherlands to compensate for war damage. The United States gained an initial victory in the 11-nation Far Eastern Commission yesterday, decisively issuing an "interim directive" to MacArthur, instructing him to immediately begin this plan. According to official sources familiar with the situation, the Soviet Union opposed it from the initial discussion, arguing that the entire solution for Japanese reparations should be agreed upon first. The Soviet side argued that the war factories in the three eastern provinces of China, worth 2 billion U.S. dollars, should be considered when the final solution for Japanese reparations is reached, which is one of the main issues. The United States had already proposed a temporary plan for preliminary reparations on February 13, but the Far Eastern Commission did not take action on it, so the United States bypassed the Far Eastern Commission and directly instructed MacArthur, which is allowed by the commission's regulations. France and India, not being included in the temporary reparations, opposed it, while Australia insisted that all reparations should be paid only after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty. China, New Zealand, Canada, the Netherlands, and the Philippines all supported the U.S. move.</p>

<h3>Pingxi Shooting Range Tragedy: Police Bureau Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Stern Negotiations with the U.S. Underway</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 4th] The Peiping Police Bureau issued a statement on the 4th stating that the main cause of the Hongshankou explosion was that U.S. soldiers failed to immediately clear unexploded shells after artillery practice at the shooting range, and that ignorant children playing with them led to the tragedy. The bureau is currently conducting stern negotiations with the U.S. based on the investigation records and expects results soon. The statement also stated that the investigation was conducted jointly by Huang, a prosecutor from the Peiping District Court, and First Lieutenant O'Dowd, a military police officer from the U.S.-China Police and Military Police Liaison Office in Peiping. The events of the incident, according to the oral statements of the injured children Shen Dazhuang, Yang Erdingzi, Song Qiyou, and other related persons Yan Zhou, Yan Dazhen, Yuan Wenxing, etc., were completely consistent. They stated that at 4:30 PM on March 31, when U.S. troops finished target practice, villager Yan Zhou and her young daughter found an unexploded shell on the west hillside. A U.S. soldier saw it and took it from them. As he walked near the artillery vehicle, he suddenly spoke in Chinese, jokingly saying to Yuan Wenxing, a child watching, "Buy me?" Yuan replied: "Broken shell casings can be sold for 100 yuan a pound, but unexploded ones are not wanted." The U.S. soldier did not answer after hearing this, and threw the shell to the west. Later, Li Xiaoliu [deceased] picked it up and took it to a place 15 meters northwest of the artillery vehicle, where he played with it with his younger brother Li Xiaomazi (deceased) and Liu Chongyuan (deceased). Unfortunately, it suddenly exploded, killing three people on the spot and injuring three others nearby, including Song Qiyou. In addition to this incident, a young child named Ma Xiaowu also died at the same location around 4:00 PM on the same day from picking up shell casings. The court has examined the body and buried it.</p>

<h3>Investigation of the Jiangyin Grain Embezzlement Case Completed: Former County Magistrate Fang Jiling and Others Indicted</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th] The Wu District Prosecutor's Office has completed its investigation of the major embezzlement case in the Jiangyin County Grain Bureau. Fang Jiling, former county magistrate, Xu Jiechang, secretary of the Grain Bureau, Zeng Chiping, director of the Qingyang Office, Xu Zukun, deputy director, Zhu Hongji, weigher, Qian Xiaojiang, Xi Junru, and Xu Jingru, all accomplices in violating Article 3, Paragraph 6, Article 3, Paragraph 7, and Article 13 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, were indicted on the 4th. As for the involvement of Wu Liang, deputy director of the Grain Bureau, Zhang Jianqiu, inspector, Chen Kejiong, warehouse manager, and Bian Yinjie, merchant, the District Prosecutor's Office found that Wu Liang had long been at odds with Fang Jiling and had secretly reported the case to the provincial office before it was exposed, indicating that he was not an accomplice. Zhang Jianqiu and others were also found to be unrelated, so they were all dismissed from prosecution. The facts of Fang and others' crimes are briefly recorded below: During the grain collection in Cheng County, Xu Jiechang relied on the county magistrate's favor and colluded with Zeng Te and other influential local figures to form the Xinyi Rice Firm, which specialized in collecting cash from grain households and using the firm's receipts as proof of payment of taxes, and then going to the warehouses to settle the exchange procedures. On the one hand, Xu Jingru was instructed to purchase rice in Wuxi with the cash collected and hand it over to the warehouse, ostensibly for the convenience of the people, but in reality, the market price was raised, and various exorbitant expenses such as transportation fees and handling fees were collected, with officials and merchants colluding to exploit the people for their own benefit. As many as 21 branches were set up, and Fang Jiling's protection and profit-sharing were clearly visible. After the case was exposed, it was transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial High Court and then referred to the Wu District Prosecutor's Office for investigation as above.</p>

Furthermore, when Yang served as the General Manager of the Puppet Central Trust Bureau, he colluded with the Japanese Mitsui and Mitsubishi companies and lent more than 400 million yuan of counterfeit currency to 40 Japanese companies.

<h3>The Pan-Asian Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>The inaugural Pan-Asian Conference concluded on the 2nd. Mahatma Gandhi of India delivered a speech at the closing session, stating that Asia would conquer the world with its love, non-violence, and true blessings; the Western nations would have to acknowledge this. He added that the Western nations are currently busy manufacturing atomic bombs, which will destroy the world; it is Asia's mission to liberate the world from this threat. Jawaharlal Nehru, Deputy Prime Minister of the Interim Government of India, also delivered a speech, asserting that Europe's domination of the world is a thing of the past. The world has followed Europe for too long, and now that Europe is divided by countless conflicts, the world is turning to Asia and America. The Asian nations must all be nation-states, but they must also have a common plan for future action. Nehru further stated that the next Pan-Asian Conference will be held in China in 1949. Thus, the inaugural Pan-Asian Conference, which had captured the world's attention, came to an end.</p>
<p>Since its opening in New Delhi on March 23rd, the Pan-Asian Conference has lasted for ten days. During this period, representatives from thirty-two nations gathered to discuss various issues in groups, achieving some agreements. In addition to reaffirming vague principles of international relations, the conference decided to establish a permanent organization named the Asian Relations Association, and to form a provisional council comprised of thirty representatives from various Asian nations. This is a concrete manifestation of the increasing solidarity among Asian nations. For the arrival of this Asian century, we, the people of the Far East, naturally express our sincere congratulations and joy. As the Pan-Asian Conference concludes, we would like to offer our thoughts.</p>
<p>In this day of the arrival of the Asian century, the need for Asian unity is self-evident. However, Asia is merely a geographical name, a part of the world's landmass. Due to its vast expanse and long history, the people of Asia, although living on the same continent, not only differ in race but also in culture. The participation of Egyptian representatives in this Pan-Asian Conference shows that the term "Asia" and "Pan-Asia" are rather ambiguous. The historical process of Europe differs from that of Asia. Due to the Roman Empire and the prevalence of Christianity, the European nations, despite their multitude, are a unit in terms of culture and history. The history of Asia is not so. In culture, America is an extension of Europe, and with Spain's exploration of North and South America, the independent countries of the Americas, although numerous, are interconnected and belong to the same family. Therefore, the Pan-American movement and the Pan-European movement have their historical factors at play. The historical development of Asian nations differs from the processes of Europe and America. Although figures such as Genghis Khan and Timur created certain unified situations, they did not leave a lasting mark on the entire history of Asia. Asian nations do not have the same historical background; therefore, the development of the Pan-Asian movement is more difficult than the Pan-European and Pan-American movements. In the past, Japanese militarists wanted to use "Hakkō ichiu" as a slogan to launch the so-called Greater East Asia movement. This was an aggressive movement centered on Japanese militarists, and its failure was expected.</p>
<p>It is precisely because Asian nations lack a common historical background that we express our immense joy at the success of this Pan-Asian Conference. It is almost unimaginable that various Asian nations, with vast differences in history, culture, and even language and race, could gather to convene the so-called Pan-Asian Conference. Yet, this inaugural Pan-Asian Conference has actually been convened, and it has been successful. This is, on the one hand, due to the appeal of the personal reputations of figures such as Gandhi and Nehru, and, on the other hand, it also reflects the awareness of Asian nations to strengthen unity. Today, Asia is situated between two major camps, and the political, economic, and social development of Asian nations still remains in a relatively backward stage. As humanity has entered the atomic age, the lives of Asian nations have not changed much from their past glorious historical periods. Mahatma Gandhi's spinning wheel and his goat – when we think of them appearing in an era when humanity has entered the atomic age, it truly evokes many feelings. It is precisely because of the backwardness in various aspects that Asian nations need close unity today. This is why we see the success of convening the Pan-Asian Conference.</p>
<p>However, the sustainability of a movement cannot rely solely on a shared psychological demand; it must have a living spiritual source to solidify this shared psychological demand. Asian nations do not have common factors in race, thought, or culture. To ensure the lasting success of this movement, it is necessary to find a common spiritual source. Marxism-Leninism must be said to be a living spiritual factor, and a common spiritual factor in the Western world must be the tradition of Christianity. Now, as the Pan-Asian movement unfolds, we carefully assess the current situation and deeply feel that only the Three Principles of the People can be the living spiritual source for this movement. The moderation and peace of the Three Principles of the People coincide with the goals of the movement advocated by Gandhi and Nehru in India. It should be the guiding principle for the Pan-Asian movement. As the Pan-Asian Conference concludes, we would like to offer this point for consideration.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Still Shows Little Progress; Reparations Issue at an Impasse, Difficult to Break; Debate on German Electoral System Arouses Heated Discussion</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Moscow Broadcast on the 4th Regarding the German reparations issue, since Marshall put forward a compromise proposal, all parties have been paying attention to Molotov. Although Marshall's proposal has the possibility of breaking the deadlock, it is still far from the Soviet side's demands. According to Marshall's proposal, how much reparations the Soviet side can obtain is currently unknown. According to the latest news, Molotov has absolutely no intention of compromising.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow 4th] The Adjustment Committee of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, in order to prepare the work completed by the four foreign ministers so far, today's meeting was almost entirely dominated by the committee. In order to allow the committee more time to work, the four foreign ministers decided to delay the meeting time by two hours than usual, that is, to meet at 6 p.m. instead of 4 p.m. At tonight's meeting, the four foreign ministers pointed out that they hope to resolve the two most serious issues in the German peace treaty, namely the future borders of Germany and the issue of reparations demands.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Moscow 3rd] Regarding the German electoral system, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference today, advocating the adoption of a proportional representation system, but was opposed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin, thus arousing heated debate. Foreign Secretary Bevin said: The proportional representation system is actually an old-fashioned social democratic system. I am opposed to any system that is sufficient to create a one-party dictatorship. Foreign Minister Molotov immediately replied: I admit that the proportional representation system is an old-fashioned democratic system, but we should at least refuse to defend the dictatorship and anti-democratic system currently practiced in Greece. Foreign Secretary Bevin retorted: The proportional representation system you proposed has already been implemented in Greece. Foreign Minister Molotov retorted: This is enough to prove that after a perfect system falls into the hands of excessively experienced people, it can produce other results. Personally, I would rather adopt the proportional representation system practiced in France than the proportional representation system practiced in Greece. The four foreign ministers then discussed the report submitted by a small subcommittee (responsible for reviewing the work of the Adjustment Committee) for a long time, and no agreement was reached on all political issues. Only in principle did they pass the proposal of French Foreign Minister Bidault to eliminate Germany's war potential. However, the four foreign ministers did not reach an agreement on the various dates proposed by Bidault.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Moscow Broadcast on the 4th: Molotov told American reporters today that the Soviet Union's proposal on German unification and the American advocacy of Germany adopting a federal system have great possibilities for compromise, but the issue of adopting a federal system should be decided by the German people through a referendum.</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Aid to Greece and Turkey Act; Acheson Answers Questions from Senators</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 3rd] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed President Truman's proposed bill to aid Greece and Turkey today, but Chairman Vandenberg proposed a surprising amendment, arguing that if the Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly opposes it, the plan can be cancelled at any time by a majority vote. The State Department also supports this, in order to show goodwill to the United Nations and those who criticize Congress, because they all condemn this move as overstepping the authority of the world organization. It is said that the United States will not veto the United Nations' order to withdraw from Greece and Turkey, but if the United Nations does not find a remedy, it cannot stop its aid plan.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 3rd] After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act, the committee members successively raised questions, asking, "Is the government considering taking the same measures for Greece to aid the Chinese government in resisting the CCP army?" Acting Secretary of State Acheson replied that the situation in Greece is very different from that in China, so the government does not intend to take the same action for the two countries, but the United States has already provided a large financial loan to the Chinese government and has already armed thirty-nine divisions of the Chinese army with weapons. Asked whether "the United States is drafting general principles as the basis for its policies around the world, especially for China, Poland, Finland, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Inner Mongolia, etc.", Acheson replied that when foreign governments request aid, we will consider each situation separately, and the measures to be taken will naturally be similar to those for Greece and Turkey.</p>
<h3>US State Department Explains True Meaning of Aid to Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 3rd] The US State Department today issued a 46-page document, answering 111 questions raised by senators regarding the US aid plan to Greece and Turkey, stating that the US aid plan to Greece and Turkey should not be seen as an "encirclement" of the Soviet Union or any other country. There is no doubt that the armed bandits led by the Communist Party in Greece are being encouraged by foreign countries. The Soviet government should not regard the US aid to Greece and Turkey as an action that requires the Soviet Union to take retaliatory measures. The State Department's views on this issue are as follows: (1) The United States intends to transport a "limited" amount of surplus military supplies to Iran; (2) The United States does not want to use aid to Greece and Turkey as a means to become a "joint guard" of the Dardanelles Strait, because the United States does not have any special responsibility for the Dardanelles Strait; (3) The US plan should not be seen as an "encirclement" of the Soviet Union or any other country; (4) The bandits led and armed by the Communist Party are the main threat to Greek independence.</p>

<h3>Truman Answers Questions from Reporters, Explaining Various Domestic and Foreign Issues</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 3rd] President Truman recently held a weekly press conference to answer various questions and issued statements as follows: (1) I completely trust Secretary of the Interior Krug and have no intention of asking him to resign. Krug will respond to Lewis within days; (2) Regarding the telephone workers' strike, I have ordered the Department of Labor to study the matter. If the workers strike, the government will requisition the telephone company; (3) Whether Secretary of State Marshall will return to the United States soon, I am unable to express an opinion here; (4) I have no emergency plan in mind regarding aid to Greece and Turkey; (5) The Chicago mayoral election candidate Kay is a Democrat; (6) The recent order I issued to civil servants in various government agencies is to obtain the loyalty of civil servants to the government, and it is not fear that the Communist Party will overthrow the US government.

<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 3rd] Regarding the issue of the United States banning the Communist Party, it is reported that after careful study, President Truman agreed with Hoover's argument that Congress should not take any measures to make the Communist Party an illegal political party, because the Communist Party has no chance of success in elections or direct action, and banning the Communist Party now would pose a major crisis to American democracy and freedom.</p>

<h3>The Gallery Was Extremely Crowded; Lights Were On in Every Home When the Court Adjourned; Lin, Yang, and Zhan Were Separately Summoned to Court; Initial Public Hearing of the Jin Chao Case; Detailed Account of the Secret Letter Process; All Matters Regarding the Five Trusting Businesses Were Determined by the Central Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The court held the first trial yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM for the case of officials and merchants colluding to manipulate gold prices. The defendants were Lin Fengbao, former director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank; Yang Anren, deputy director; and Zhan Yesheng, chairman of the Gold Businesses Association. The witnesses summoned were Feng Qing'an (manager of Yang Qinghe Fa Ji Gold Shop), Zhang Baiyuan (manager of Dafeng Heng Gold Shop), Ni Zuguang (manager of Fang Jiuxia Chang Ji Gold Shop), Xie Bingquan (manager of Dakang Yuan Gold Shop), Wang Liyuan (employee of Tong Fengyu Gold Shop), Wang Songtao (assistant manager and chief of the Cashier Section of the Central Bank's Business Bureau), and Ying Minghe (manager of Tong Fengyu Gold Shop). All but Ying Minghe, who received the summons too late to arrive, appeared in court. After six hours of separate questioning by Judge Jia Zhuo, the court announced that the trial would be adjourned and rescheduled. Defendants Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren remained on bail from the Central Bank, while Zhan Liansheng was returned to custody. By the time of adjournment, lights were on in every home.</p>
<p>The Second Criminal Court of the District Court added court police yesterday to guard the "Jin Chao Case" trial, the gallery was full, and latecomers were denied entry. Lawyer seats and reporter seats were also crowded. After the court inquired about the ages and hometowns of the three defendants Lin, Yang, and Zhan, the clerk read aloud the recorded statements of the four witnesses, Feng Qing'an, Zhang Baiyuan, Ni Zuguang, and Xie Bingquan, who were summoned on the 28th of last month. After reading, Chen Tingshuo, the lawyer defending Zhan, claimed that the witness's statement that Zhan Liansheng participated in the Central Bank's decision on gold prices was inconsistent with the facts and requested a detailed inquiry of the three defendants. Ni Fengguang, the manager of Fang Jiuxia, also requested a correction, stating that Zhan did not participate in deciding the price and that everything was determined by the Central Bank itself. The court rebuked: "You will be held criminally liable for perjury. It has been explained last time. Why are you recanting today?" Then began individual questioning.</p>
<p>Lin Fengbao</p>
<p>Testified that the organization of the Central Bank's Business Bureau consisted of one director, six deputy directors, and more than ten assistant managers. The director, deputy directors, and heads of various sections were responsible for their respective levels of business. The Central Bank's gold sales policy was based on the resolution passed by the National Defense Supreme Council on February 25 of last year, which opened up free trading of foreign exchange and gold, and Article 29 of the Foreign Exchange Opening Plan authorized the Central Bank to freely trade based on market conditions. Bei Zuyi, the former president of the Central Bank, personally decided on the explicit and secret distribution, targeting gold shops and silver shops. Starting from March 8 of last year, he personally oversaw the initial ten days or so, with Bei personally presiding over both explicit and secret gold price distribution, which was then handed over to the Business Bureau.</p>
<p>Explicit and Secret Distribution Initially Effective</p>
<p>The explicit distribution price was determined daily at 10:00 AM with reference to market conditions. Although the gold market started trading at 9:00 AM, gold was inseparable from foreign exchange, and foreign exchange rates were not available until 10:00 AM, so the gold price was also determined at 10:00 AM every morning. Secret sales began on March 9 of last year. There was only one explicit distribution per day because the Central Bank aimed to suppress gold prices. If the gold market rose sharply in the middle of the day, it would be sold through designated businesses in a secret manner so that the market would not know that it was sold by the Central Bank. The price was the highest price at that time to increase national treasury revenue. At the same time, increasing chips and increasing supply could achieve the effect of suppressing prices. The court questioned: Since the Central Bank was always committed to suppressing gold prices, why did the gold price still rise every day? Lin replied: "In the months of March, April, May, June, and July last year, the Central Bank's gold policy was quite successful. During this period, the gold price remained around 2 million. On August 19, the National Government adjusted the foreign exchange rate, and the gold price once skyrocketed. The Central Bank immediately made every effort to suppress it, and it stabilized again in two days. After October, profiteers speculated on gold, and the Central Bank's sales could not be controlled. Therefore, at the beginning of February, the highest authorities decided to stop the distribution."</p>
<p>Central Bank Determines the Five Trusting Businesses</p>
<p>As for Zhan Liansheng, they were not previously acquainted. When it was decided to distribute gold, President Bei summoned Xu Bosheng, the former chairman of the Gold Industry Association, to the bank and introduced them. Zhan came as the chairman of the Gold Businesses Association and brought a list of more than 60 gold businesses, from which five with good reputations were selected and designated to purchase. For explicit gold distribution, the Central Bank supplied it without limitation, without the need to apply. Tong Fengyu, Taikang Run, Fang Jiuxia, Yang Qinghe, and Dafeng Heng were also directly designated by the Central Bank without going through application procedures. The Central Bank also did not use application forms for gold distribution. Moreover, because the Central Bank entrusted Tong Fengyu to handle the work of converting gold blocks into ten-tael gold bars, gold distribution was sometimes directly received from Tong Fengyu for convenience. For gold distribution transactions completed in the morning, settlement was done on the same day, and transactions completed in the afternoon were settled the next day, and no arrears were allowed. The court questioned the discrepancies between the Central Bank's accounts and the accounts of the gold shops and silver shops. Lin stated that the Central Bank's accounts must be balanced with the amount of cash every day, so there were no errors.</p>
<p>Yang Anren</p>
<p>Testified that as the deputy director of the Central Bank, he was in charge of the gold and silver section. The distribution of gold was a national government policy, and the Central Bank's Business Bureau only followed it. Explicit distribution was supplied by the Central Bank without limitation, and there were no mandatory regulations for secret sales. Application forms were a procedure between gold shops, silver shop members, and the association, and had nothing to do with the Central Bank. The Central Bank's pricing for explicit distribution was very open, so complicated procedures were not used. Zhan Liansheng was an old acquaintance because he was the chairman of the Gold Brokers Association before the war and had dealings with the Central Bank, so he was familiar with him. For secret gold sales, five businesses were designated and divided into two groups. Taikang Run was independent, and Zhan Liansheng's seal was not required for guarantee when taking gold. When Fang Jiuxia, Tong Fengyu, Dafeng Heng, and Yang Qinghe took gold, Zhan's seal was required for guarantee if funds were insufficient.</p>
<p>Zhan Liansheng</p>
<p>Testified that Tong Fengyu was a partnership organization, divided into fifteen shares, and Central Bank employees did not have shares. He did not previously know Lin Fengbao, but had known Yang Anren for more than ten years. The gold distribution price, whether explicit or secret, was determined by the Central Bank itself, and he could not participate. For explicit distribution, the gold shops and silver shops would first determine the number of bars, and then the Central Bank would offer a price. If it was too expensive, the number of bars could be reduced, but not increased. Secret sales were not fixed in time or quantity. Bank drafts were often used for settlement in the morning, and a small amount of cash was used in the afternoon. The court presented the customer accounts of Tong Fengyu, with the names "Zhongzhi," "Zhongyi," and "Central Friend" recorded. What was the explanation? Zhan replied: "Zhongzhi" was used when lower-level employees of the Central Bank purchased gold, "Zhongyi" was the account name for the Central Bank's doormen, workers, and old clerks to buy and sell gold, and "Central Friend" was probably friends of Central Bank employees. Wang Songtao, the assistant manager and cashier director of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, once purchased more than a hundred gold bars from Tong Fengyu. As for the detailed situation on the accounts, it would be known by questioning Ying Minghe.</p>
<p>After the three defendants were questioned, the court questioned each witness one by one. Wang Songtao denied purchasing gold, saying that he only introduced relatives and friends. Wang Liyuan also denied that senior Central Bank officials had entrusted her to purchase gold bars. The statements of the other witnesses were generally similar to before.</p>

At 7:00 AM, more than 10,000 children, orphans, and infants gathered at the dim and huge Tianchan Stage, under the supervision of their fathers, brothers, and teachers, to celebrate their own program. The whole venue was filled with a naive and lively atmosphere, and the sound of the scout music alternated. The rostrum was full of great figures who had lost their youth, all of whom, as elders, gave fairy tales one after another.</p>
<p>The mayor said in his speech: "I hope that everyone in the world will maintain the innocent and unadorned heart of a child, because this is the vitality of the nation."</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi said: "The rise and fall of a country lies in the people, and the rise and fall of a family lies in the children. So we must pay attention to children.

<p>Chen Kuitang, a blind child representing all blind children from the blind school, gave a speech. He said painfully: "Today I want to file a complaint to the society. The reason why we became blind is not our fault, but the unsoundness of the social medical institutions. Otherwise, at least 80% or more can be guaranteed not to become disabled." He made two demands to the society: (1) Strengthen medical institutions. (2) Provide as much assistance as possible to the unfortunate blind people.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan was slightly late to the meeting due to other official duties. He gave a brief speech, roughly saying: "China is now moving towards the avenue of democratic politics. The future is bright and optimistic. Children are closely related to the national fortune. I firmly believe that the future of children will be bright and promising."</p>
<p>Finally, children's representatives Huang Junjie, Dai Ying, Wu Jiezong, and others gave thank-you speeches separately. Then Mayor Wu began to award prizes for the health competition. The strong spotlights on the stage lit up, and the baby suddenly cried. Mayor Wu heard the sound and showed a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Finally, there were performances by Pan Yuzhen, the national music of Wei Shenle, and the screening of movies by the American News Office, which did not end until about 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Refugee and Orphan Reception Center in Caohejing was recently sponsored by Guan Sheng Yuan Food Company General Manager Xi Guansheng. Yesterday morning, the refugee children representatives presented a banner to express their gratitude.</p>

<h3>During the Enemy and Puppet Period, A Bully in Hongkou Claimed to Be Familiar with "Head" and Was Forced to Be District Chief</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Jifa, who once served as the district chief of the Third District of the Enemy Navy Baojia, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. Because Wu had lived in Hongkou for many years, he was a well-known bully in Hongkou during the enemy and puppet period. The gallery was extremely crowded with those who came to listen. Wu was fat-headed and big-eared, wearing a gray cloth gown and yellow leather shoes. He answered the questions of Judge Liu in a confident manner.</p>
<p>It was found that Wu Jifa, 43 years old, from Danyang, lived at No. 773 Tangshan Road and ran a noodle restaurant. During the period when the enemy army occupied Shanghai, the area north of the Suzhou River was designated as the enemy navy garrison area. A Baojia headquarters was established at No. 25 Pingliang Road, and Qi Shouyu was sent in charge. The area between Dalianwan Road, Zhaofeng Road, Zhujia Lane, and the Huangpu River was designated as the Third District. From November of the 30th year, Wu was sent as the district chief of the district and concurrently served as the leader of the pseudo-Youth League in the district. He acted arbitrarily and harmed merchants and people. He once collected copper from the people, levied Baojia donations and aircraft donations, forced participation in self-defense team sentry duty, and air defense training, and blocked traffic at any time to search pedestrians. He also opened Wu Fang Hotel. A traveler Wang Yanhua, Luo Jiayu, sold 800 sacks. The hotel accountant Dai Yi planned to buy 200 forcibly but failed. He reported to the enemy army and pointed out that the sacks were military supplies, and all were confiscated. After the victory, victims Yu Senkang, Wang Yanhua, Feng Ermao, and others filed a complaint. The High Procuratorate prosecuted Wu on suspicion of being a traitor due to his serious crimes.</p>
<p>When Wu defended yesterday, he admitted that he had served as the district chief of the Third District of the Enemy Navy Baojia and concurrently as the leader of the pseudo-Youth League. However, he said: "Because Qi Shouyu often came to my store to eat noodles, seeing that I was very familiar with the people in the area, he said: 'Little guy, come out and do things. You have to do it, unless you move your store to Chongqing.' Later, the Japanese came to oppress me again, and there was no way to come out and be the district chief." As for the continuous questions about the collection of copper, the collection of Baojia donations, and the aircraft donations, he said that he did not know and shirked responsibility to the Baojia headquarters. He coughed dryly to cover up his embarrassment. As for the self-defense team sentry duty, he said that it was to prevent petty thieves from stealing things. As for the blockade, he said that he did not have this power. Regarding the confiscation of the 800 sacks of travelers Wang Yanhua and Luo Jiayu in Wu Fang Hotel, he said: "The rooms in Wu Fang Hotel are very small and cannot hold 800 sacks at all."</p>
<p>After summoning Wang Yanhua, Feng Ermao, and the mother of Chen Koudi, another victim, and questioning them, it was announced that the case still needed to be investigated, and the defendants were sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Two Foremen in the Same Case as Zhou Liesheng Are Retried; The Court Summons the Wives of the Two Accused; Each Is Given A Proclamation: "Eliminate Extortion and Bribery"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ren Tianfu and Que Chuyang, the foremen of Rihuigang, who are in the same case as Zhou Gengsheng, who is currently starving to death in the High Court detention center, were accused of being suspected of being traitors and were retried in the High Court yesterday. Ren and Que vehemently denied the accuser Wo Fulin's accusation that they acted as secret agents in the enemy gendarmerie, and said that this matter was purely because Wo was trying to seize the position of foreman. Judge Liu announced that the case still needed to be investigated and summoned the wives of the two defendants Ren and Que to the front of the case, each giving them a small proclamation of "Eliminate Extortion and Bribery" and said: "If anyone comes to your house to extort money, do not be deceived. You can twist this person to this court for legal action." The two women, who were dressed in blue cloth shorts and looked simple-minded, took the proclamation, covered their faces, and retreated.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at a Central Textile Factory: Shooting Leads to Tragedy; Four Workers Injured or Killed; Union Chairman Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A labor dispute at Central Textile Factory No. 12 (formerly known as Dakang Yarn Factory), No. 195, Tengyue Road, Hudong, yesterday afternoon at about 4:00 PM. According to practice, the union fees were deducted from the workers' wages by the union account class. When Cai Zhichun and Ni Jiaju, the union cadres of the Fourth District Textile Workers Union, collected union fees, some workers objected to the deduction, resulting in a conflict and being surrounded and beaten. Union Chairman She Jingcheng rushed to mediate upon hearing the news, but more and more workers gathered. To avoid being harmed innocently, She drew his own pistol and fired seven shots in succession, injuring workers Liu Jilin and Li Zhen in the chest, Wang Zhankui in the arm, and Yan Sixi in the waist. The factory hired a car to send them to Hudong Hospital. Liu and Li eventually died of their injuries. Wang and Yan were fortunately slightly injured and temporarily stayed in the hospital for treatment. The Yangshupu Police Branch reported the case. Branch Director Wang Xinheng led Section Chief Wang and all the criminal section police officers to the scene and arrested Yu Jingcheng. She confessed that he had two rows of bullets, a total of fourteen, and had fired seven shots.</p>

<h3>Another Small Loan Organization</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the Relief Society's establishment of small business loans, another organization, the Intermediate Credit Trust Company, together with Jincheng, Dalu, Siming, China Industrial and Mining, Women's Commerce, and other banks, a total of ten units, have jointly established a Joint Credit Small Loan Office, with a fund of 300,000 yuan. The loan recipients are limited to public school teachers and commercial and industrial employees, with an interest rate of five percent and a term of three months. The loan amount each time is from 300,000 to 1,000,000 yuan, managed by Mr. Mao Xiaocen. According to Mr. Mao, with 300,000 yuan, assuming each person borrows 800,000 yuan at a time, only about 400 people can be loaned to, and it is estimated that it will be exhausted in less than a month. This meager amount is hardly enough to speak of as a welfare service for society, but it is hoped that all sectors of the city's banking and finance community can continue to respond and organize separately. If the city's more than 200 banks can each contribute 30 million yuan as a welfare loan fund, the total amount will exceed 7,000,000 yuan. If used well, the beneficiaries will be extremely widespread. Furthermore, this loan is expected to be implemented in mid-month. One million yuan can be loaned each time, at an interest rate of five percent.</p>

The small exams originally scheduled to begin on the 7th will also be postponed for one week. The board of directors held a temporary meeting yesterday afternoon and accepted the recommendations of the school affairs administration committee. It was decided that after the students resume classes, starting next week, students will be allowed free entry and exit during the hours of 7:30 am to 6:00 pm if they have no classes. However, this is still a trial. Furthermore, at 3:00 pm yesterday, the school hosted reporters from various newspapers at No. 6 The Bund. Secretary-General Sun Ruilin, Dean of Students Geng Yuanxue, and Secretary Lu Shixiong reported on the course of the student unrest.

<h3>The Significance of the Normal Education Movement Week</h3>
<p>— Gu Yuxiu</p>
<p>Teach tirelessly, learn without end, teaching and learning complement each other, knowledge and benevolence are upheld. Be strict like a father, kind like a mother, strictness and kindness complement each other, rites are established and music is achieved.</p>
<p>Today is Normal Education Movement Week, and I plan to briefly describe the significance of Normal Education Movement Week.</p>
<p>First, I will explain the meaning of the two words "Normal Education." The so-called "teacher" is a teacher, and "normal" means a model. Normal schools already existed in considerable numbers when the new school system in China began. Its purpose is to teach people how to be teachers, so it is a place to cultivate teachers. Our promotion of the Normal Education Movement is to illustrate that today's teachers are not sufficient in number for distribution. Because universities believe that university professors have other methods for teaching, only teachers in primary and secondary schools and kindergartens must have specialized schools to engage in professional training.</p>
<p>I remember that at the commemorative meeting for this Normal Education Movement Week, Mr. Chen Heqin used machines to compare children, saying: If a machine is damaged, not just anyone can repair it. As for a child, their psychological development is far more complex than a machine, and it is not something that just anyone can teach unless they have methods, passion, and knowledge. We must first learn how to be a teacher before we can be a good teacher.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the increase in schools and the advancement of knowledge, there has been a great lack of teachers. Therefore, we have established many normal schools and used public funds to encourage normal school students, allowing them to study for free in school and serve the education field for a long time after leaving school. However, because few students enroll, the problem of teacher shortage remains unresolved. Therefore, promoting Normal Education Movement Week can, on the one hand, provide students with a training opportunity; on the other hand, Normal Education Movement Week requires students to take an oath in front of everyone, allowing them to understand that being a teacher requires a spirit of continuous service. At the same time, during the Anti-Japanese War, we also take this opportunity to express our welcome to the teachers who had to leave the teaching profession due to the pressure of life but returned to the education field after the victory. In this way, the answer to the problem of teacher shortage can be helped a little.</p>
<p>The Normal Education Movement has been going on for five years, and this is the sixth Normal Education Movement Week. When it was held for the first time, I was serving in the Ministry of Education. Minister Chen and I discussed a couplet, which I will now tell you about. I had forgotten this couplet at first, but I remembered it again a few days ago thanks to the reminder from President Zhang of Fudan University.</p>
<p>The first sentence of the first line of this couplet is "Teach tirelessly," which means teaching others without ever feeling tired. The second is "Learn without end," because learning is endless and must continue to be pursued. This is not only for teachers but also for everyone. "Teaching and learning complement each other." Teachers self-study and learn, which can enrich their knowledge, but the progress made through teaching is also very significant. When we are in school, we always think that we are proficient in various subjects. Once we leave school to teach others, we realize that we cannot teach anything. We only know our shortcomings after teaching, so we must prepare. Many university professors become experts because of teaching students. Primary, secondary, and kindergarten teachers are in constant contact with lively children, so there will definitely be great progress, so it is said that teaching and learning mutually inspire and enhance each other. The next sentence is "Knowledge and benevolence are upheld," which means that after knowledge is gained, benevolence and universal love are used to continue to maintain it for a long time. The words above combined are "Teach tirelessly, learn without end, teaching and learning complement each other, knowledge and benevolence are upheld." This line is aimed at the teacher's pursuit of learning.</p>
<p>The second line is also for teachers. What is said is the teacher's attitude and the function and purpose of education. A teacher should be "strict like a father," as strict as a father, and "kind like a mother," as kind as a mother. Teachers are like parents. Parents are the people that children love the most and are also the most popular among children. As the saying goes, "Do not mislead children," which shows how important the teacher's position is. But if teachers are only kind like a mother, they will inevitably be too lenient. If they are only strict like a father, they will inevitably be too severe. Lenience can easily make children indulge, and severity can easily make children suffer. Therefore, teachers must "complement strictness and kindness," without neglecting either. In the past, teachers often regarded themselves as strict teachers, but the new education does not. It requires understanding children's psychology, influencing children's behavior, and combining strictness and kindness. This seems difficult to do, but to be successful in education, it must be done. The last sentence is "Rites are established and music is achieved." The ancients said, "Establish rites and make music upon success." Rites are mainly solemn, like a father, and music is mainly kind and harmonious, like a mother. If there are only rites, then it is rigid and a terrible shackle; if there is only music, then it is easy to be soft and scattered. Therefore, Confucius created rites and music to be used together, one is indispensable. The basic purpose of the six arts of education is to build a nation, and the key to the success of nation-building depends on the completion of education. This line combined is "Be strict like a father, kind like a mother, strictness and kindness complement each other, rites are established and music is achieved."</p>
<p>In summary, the significance of the Normal Education Movement is, on the one hand, to awaken society to respect teachers, and on the other hand, to encourage teachers to rise up and complete their great tasks. I hope that everyone will widely promote the Normal Education Movement. Whether they are teachers, parents, or people from all walks of life, everyone should participate in this Normal Education Movement Week, work together, and achieve education first and successful nation-building!</p>

<p>Chinese Medicine and Chinese Herbs Published on the 5th of Every Month</p>
<h3>Breast Cancer in Women</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zanchen</p>
<p>Breast cancer is the most dangerous disease among women's breast ailments. It is not common in the strong and healthy, but it is easier to suffer from in the weak and elderly. Its origin is very distant. It first starts as a hard lump in the breast. Sometimes there is a twitching pain in the breast, which is the initial sign. If treatment is started at this time, it can often be cured. If the opportunity is missed and delayed, it becomes as large as a fist or a bowl, the body is as hard as stone, or it even ulcerates, revealing countless wounds, like a cancerous rock. Even with a good doctor, it is not easy to start.</p>
<p>Chinese doctors have their own reasons for the causes of breast cancer. Chen Yuangong said it is caused by a large deficiency of qi and blood. Chen Shigong said it is caused by melancholy damaging the liver, contemplation damaging the spleen, and accumulated thoughts in the heart, with unfulfilled wishes, leading to meridian obstruction and gathering into a lump. This is similar to the foreign scholars' theory that the nervous system is related to the limitation and occurrence of various tumors.</p>
<p>Wang Sheng's Surgical Principles says: "Breast cancer can be treated in women under 40, but not in those over 50. Treating it will lead to death, but not treating it will allow them to live out their natural lifespan."</p>
<p>Han Qing said: "Whether a woman is married or unmarried, they can all develop this condition. It is caused by the extreme yin and declining yang, where deficient yang accumulates with blood, and the blood permeates the heart meridian. If it has not broken, it can be treated; if it has broken, it is difficult to treat."</p>
<p>Hu Gongbi said: "Breast cancer is caused by women's suspicious nature, or dissatisfaction with their mother-in-law, or dissatisfaction with their husband and children. Failing to take care of themselves, resentment brews, and depression accumulates, leading to the qi of the jueyin meridian not flowing, and the blood of the yangming meridian boiling. The breast orifices are blocked, forming a hard lump, shaped like a chess piece. It may not develop for five or seven years, or even more than ten years. Later, due to the prevailing age or a sudden anger, it erupts and rots, opening like a flipped pomegranate flower. It can be treated in those under 30 years old with strong qi and blood, but it is difficult to treat in those over 40 years old with declining qi and blood."</p>
<p>Combining the above statements, the prognosis of breast cancer can be generally imagined.</p>
<p>It is an extremely regrettable disease for women to suffer from breast cancer. It is an extremely unpleasant thing for doctors to treat breast cancer. To restore health, patients with breast cancer must have the following basic principles: First, there must be sufficient family financial resources to supply the use of medicine. Second, the mind must be peaceful and listen to the doctor's guidance. Third, maintain excellent nutrition.</p>
<p>Surgical removal of breast cancer can be performed if the area and lump are not widespread.</p>
<p>Drug treatment of breast cancer, based on many years of experience, feels that for early-stage symptoms, about ten to twenty doses of Yang He Tang or Xiao Jin Dan can generally eliminate it. Chen Yuangong's Hua Yan Dan and Xian Qingyu's Xiao Ruyan Wan can all be considered for reference.</p>
<p>For mild and early-stage cancer, simple formulas such as crucian carp paste and crab shell powder are very commonly used.</p>
<h3>Painful Menstruation</h3>
<p>— Zhu Diran</p>
<p>Menstruation is a special physiological function in women, originally a preparation for life and death. The regularity and abnormalities of menstruation are closely related to women's health and have an impact on fertility.</p>
<p>Among the many types of menstrual disorders in women, the most common is dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation). Dysmenorrhea is even more prevalent among women in Shanghai than among those in inland areas.</p>
<p>There are many causes of dysmenorrhea, including physiological deformities, latent venereal diseases, excessive sexual desire, physical stimulation, and especially restrictive clothing, which can often lead to the symptoms of dysmenorrhea.</p>
<p>The symptoms of dysmenorrhea are that women experience abdominal distension and pain, breast hardening and distension, limb fatigue, and decreased appetite before their period. During menstruation, there may be abdominal distension and pain, and the menstrual blood may sometimes clot.</p>
<p>The occurrence of dysmenorrhea is sometimes accidental and can resolve itself without treatment, but chronic cases tend to worsen over time.</p>
<p>If dysmenorrhea is not treated, it often turns into conditions such as dry blood and uterine cancer in middle age.</p>
<p>I have summarized the treatment methods for dysmenorrhea into the following:</p>
<p>(1) Soothing the Liver: For menstrual pain caused by emotional depression, Chinese medicine uses the method of soothing the liver, which involves using Xiaoyao San (Free and Easy Wanderer Powder) with modifications. This can both regulate liver qi and promote blood circulation, which is a very reliable method.</p>
<p>(2) Nourishing the Blood: When blood is depleted and the blood vessels cannot flow smoothly, simply nourishing the blood sufficiently will strengthen circulation, and pathological conditions such as pain will subside.</p>
<p>(3) Removing Blood Stasis: For dysmenorrhea caused by blood clots blocking blood vessels, simply removing the blood clots will allow the menstrual flow to become smooth, and the pain will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>(4) Warming the Meridians: If the uterus is cold and the blood cannot circulate, using herbs such as cinnamon and Evodia rutaecarpa can provide a radical cure.</p>
<p>(5) Cooling the Blood: If there is heat in the blood sea (a concept in traditional Chinese medicine), causing pain, it is likely that the endometrium, the uterine substance, and the fallopian tubes are inflamed. The only treatment is to use blood-cooling herbs such as Moutan bark and rehmannia root.</p>
<p>(6) Relieving Worries: This method is a type of psychological therapy. A friend's wife used to suffer from severe dysmenorrhea, and many doctors were ineffective. I told her some stories, which helped her forget her pain.</p>
<h3>Two Pharmaceutical Matters</h3>
<p>— Cen Zhiliang</p>
<p>Improving Pharmaceutical Manufacturing: Traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are closely related. The effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine is undeniable. However, the manufacturing methods never improve, preventing it from stepping one foot out of the country. In the future, scientific methods should be adopted to improve it, so that it is more convenient for doctors to apply clinically, and the effectiveness will naturally be doubled.</p>
<p>Cultivating Medicinal Materials: The so-called authentic medicinal materials in China are all natural products. However, some medicinal materials are in high demand but low in production, resulting in high prices and affecting business. Therefore, some people use imported products. To remedy this drawback, it is necessary to have abundant production, and to achieve abundant production, artificial cultivation must be promoted.</p>
<p>A Thought</p>
<h3>The Medicinal Value of "Amaranth"</h3>
<p>— Gong Peiying</p>
<p>Especially Rich in Vitamin C</p>
<p>We were initially surprised to see in the Compendium of Materia Medica that amaranth can be used to treat diseases, because it is just a common vegetable and doesn't seem to have any special properties. Therefore, we looked down on it!</p>
<p>However, recent research has revealed that it has many benefits. Han Baosheng once said: "There are six types of amaranth: red amaranth, white amaranth, man amaranth, purple amaranth, five-colored amaranth, and horse amaranth. Man amaranth and white amaranth can be used for medicinal purposes. Red amaranth has a pungent taste and other uses." Su Song said: "Man amaranth and white amaranth are cold in nature, also known as sugar amaranth, Hu amaranth, and fine amaranth. In fact, they are the same. The larger one is called white amaranth, and the smaller one is called man amaranth. White amaranth replenishes qi, clears heat, and opens the nine orifices. Red amaranth treats red dysentery. Purple amaranth kills insect poisons and treats qi dysentery. Man amaranth can benefit the large and small intestines and treat all types of dysentery and induce abortion." Scientists now report that both white amaranth and red amaranth contain calcium, and red amaranth contains even more iron. Ordinary white amaranth sold in the market contains 1.09 mg of Vitamin C per cubic centimeter. Red amaranth contains only 0.25 mg per cubic centimeter. This shows that the content of Vitamin C is five times higher in white amaranth.</p>
<p>It has also been determined that the function of Vitamin C contained in amaranth is the same as that of American oranges and can also treat scurvy. In other words, eating this regularly can prevent the invasion of scurvy.</p>
<p>Now there are many children with scurvy, so choose this amaranth, which contains valuable ingredients, as a non-medicinal treatment.</p>
<p>Everywhere</p>
<h3>Trachoma</h3>
<p>— Ye Jinqiu</p>
<p>A few years ago, a medical journal asked me to write some articles on single prescriptions. I wrote a short story about Hu Die and Mei Lanfang before they went abroad and gave it to him. The general idea was:</p>
<p>Western countries pay close attention to trachoma. Even the slightest problem must be strictly prevented. Those who travel to those countries from China are inspected particularly closely because Chinese people pay too little attention to it. Before Hu Die, Mei Lanfang, and their entourage went abroad that time, thirteen followers all had some eye problems, so they were greatly hampered, and seeking treatment was not easy to cure quickly. Just as they were at a loss, Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, came up with a secret recipe. The recipe was carp bile juice, mixed with oriental cinnabar and applied to the affected area, and they were immediately cured. The secret recipe was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Since its publication, it has attracted the attention of many people. Mr. Zheng Jian-san was the first to write to the Municipal National Medical Association to inquire about the pharmacology. Mr. Xi Jie, a reporter from Jingbao, also indirectly inquired about Dr. Mei. The reply was:</p>
<p>I was asked to inquire about the treatment of trachoma. Last night, Wan Hua (Dr. Mei's name) invited me to dinner, and I asked him about it at the banquet. According to him, many people in the troupe suffered from trachoma before going to the United States. Someone came up with a prescription: grind green fish bile and yellow cinnabar (this is a medicinal product, available in all pharmacies) into a powder, mix it with water, and drop a little into the eyes. The patients treated themselves according to this method, and after examination, they all passed. However, I don't know for sure whether this prescription is effective for trachoma, but I do know that some members of the troupe did use it at the time. — See Jingbao, August 4, 1936</p>
<p>Then (August 8), Jingbao published an article by Bao Jun-cheng:</p>
<p>My little boy is twelve years old this year and is suffering from trachoma. He has been treated by doctors, but with little effect. I couldn't help but be overjoyed when I read the newspaper. As the saying goes, "A single prescription of medicine can infuriate a famous doctor." I immediately went to the pharmacy, bought green fish bile and yellow cinnabar, and treated him according to the method. Unexpectedly, as soon as the medicine entered his eyes, the little boy screamed in pain, and the red veins in his eyes suddenly appeared. I don't know much about medicine. Is this a phenomenon that occurs at the beginning of treatment, and will it be effective later? I also don't know if the members of Mr. Mei's troupe had this phenomenon when they were treated.</p>
<p>It is recorded that the prescription comes from the Sheng Hui Fang written by Chen Shiliang of the Southern Tang Dynasty. The prescription uses half an ounce of lead cinnabar, mixed with carp bile juice into a paste, and applied two or three times a day, specifically to treat eyes with pearl tubes. Oriental cinnabar is lead cinnabar, also known as yellow cinnabar, cinnabar powder, and vermilion powder, all made from lead. It is found that trachoma has different types: granular, papillary, cicatricial, and mixed. Lead quality is also harmful to the limited, but ancient prescriptions for eye medicine often use it, or perhaps the ancient and modern refining are different. In addition, most eye medicines are water-flying, that is, as fine as possible, and sudden pain in the eyes is probably related to the thickness.</p>
<p>(Note by Cunren: This prescription has been submitted to ophthalmologists Lu Nanzhi and Li Qizhi for research. Seeking several trachoma patients for free treatment, you can write to No. 1 Weihaiwei Road for reply.)</p>
<h3>Questions about Using Tamarix chinensis for Measles</h3>
<p>— You Xuezhou</p>
<p>It is well known that Tamarix chinensis is used to treat measles, and it is also a single prescription commonly used by the people to treat measles. According to the custom in my hometown of Wuxi, when children first show signs of measles, they immediately seek out Tamarix chinensis to decoct and drink, saying that it has the property of promoting eruption and can speed up the eruption of measles to avoid unexpected changes. However, according to the custom in Yin County, Tamarix chinensis is only taken when the measles recedes. Therefore, when I first came to Shanghai and used Tamarix chinensis to treat measles, I would ask people from Yin County whether Tamarix chinensis could be taken. Strangely, I asked the reason, and then I realized that "different places have different methods, and different temples have different Bodhisattvas." Since then, I have had doubts about the use of Tamarix chinensis to treat measles: when measles first appear, the focus is on eruption, and the medicine must use those that are volatile and contain a little stimulating, that is, the old method calls it "hot in nature"; when measles recede, the focus is on detoxification, and the medicine must use those that reduce inflammation and fever or have a yin-nourishing effect, that is, the old method calls it "cold in nature." What is the nature and taste of Tamarix chinensis? What kind of effect does it have on measles? This is something that must be considered.</p>
<p>The symptoms of the same disease often differ between urban and rural areas. Taking measles as an example, children in rural areas often have red faces, coarse breath, a great thirst for drinking, constipation, and a thick yellow tongue coating or a green dry tongue. The treatment methods are nothing more than two: one is to relieve both the exterior and interior at the same time, to erupt the measles while inducing the bowel movement, although the functions are opposite, the effects can be complementary. The other is to use the "black and blue soup" method, which not only relieves the exterior, but also nourishes the yin to save its depleted body fluids and increase its resistance. Because the internal heat is strong, herbs that are cold in nature are not only not forbidden, but even used quickly, such as the "Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang" prescription, which is not abandoned because it contains gypsum, and is even regarded as an emergency prescription when measles change adversely. As for the urban area—especially Shanghai—children with measles, although they have a high fever, often have pale faces and rarely see a red and dry tongue. Therefore, usually only the method of opening the lungs and relieving the exterior is used to help its outward expansion. From this, I realized that the treatment of measles with Tamarix chinensis is not to promote eruption, but to take its Qing Jie (clear and resolve toxicity). In my hometown of Xixi, it is used when the initial signs of spots appear, which is designed for those with fever and heat on the face, which is different from the Yin people's use when it recedes. Although the time is different, the effects are actually the same.</p>
<p>Since then, I have used Tamarix chinensis in my prescriptions for those who have just shown signs of measles with fever, thirst, irritability, and coarse breath, and I do not use it if there is no such phenomenon. The purpose is not to erupt the skin rash, but to clear away the heat. Fortunately, there have been no accidents for more than ten years. However, what is the actual function of Tamarix chinensis? Is my personal opinion reliable? It is still a doubt, and I hope that my colleagues who have true knowledge and insight will come forward to teach me.</p>

<h3>The National Bank Designates 23 Cities to Solicit and Sell US Dollar Bonds; Shanghai Banking and Financial Industries Pledge to Subscribe to US$40 Million</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Starting today, short-term US dollar treasury bills and US dollar bonds for 1947 will be pre-sold by the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank and 81 entrusted banks and firms in Shanghai. To date, the Shanghai Banking and Financial Industries Association has subscribed to US$30 million in short-term treasury bills, equivalent to CN¥360 billion, and US$10 million in US dollar bonds, equivalent to CN¥120 billion. This already accounts for one-fifth of the first phase issuance of these bonds, totaling US$200 million. The Nanjing Banking and Financial Industries Association has also pledged to subscribe to CN¥10 billion in bonds. The Nanjing China Cement Company has also subscribed to CN¥100 million. As for issuance matters in various regions, the National Bank has also telegraphed to its branches in Nanjing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Xi'an, Hankou, Kunming, Beiping, Qingdao, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Bengbu, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Lanzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and 23 other cities to immediately form solicitation and sales committees and entrust qualified banks and firms in various regions to act as agents for sales.</p>
<h3>Public Meeting of the Shanghai Solicitation Committee; Qian Xinzhi Elected Chairman</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Solicitation Committee for the 1947 Short-Term Treasury Bills and US Dollar Bonds held its inaugural meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday in the conference room on the third floor of the National Bank. All 17 members attended, and the meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m. Qian Xinzhi was elected chairman, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiqing were elected vice chairmen. Lun was hired as the secretary-general of the committee, and Fan Heyan was the deputy secretary-general. After the meeting, Chairman Qian Xinzhi gave a speech to the press, stating that US dollar treasury bills and bonds are the first bonds issued after the victory. The purpose is to stabilize the current economic situation, as wartime finance relied heavily on the issuance of currency, resulting in currency inflation, soaring prices, and huge expenditures, affecting the general public. Now, in order to stabilize prices, reduce the issuance of currency, and absorb idle funds in the market at the same time, everyone needs to actively subscribe to bonds. This is beneficial to both the country and the people. According to this issuance, US dollar treasury bills and bonds are guaranteed by foreign exchange funds and solid assets. In addition, the Fund Management Committee needs to report the amount of fund receipts and payments every six months. Moreover, these bonds can be freely bought and sold for mortgage purposes, can be used as a guarantee reserve for the financial industry, and can also be used to pay the National Bank's deposit reserve, so the conditions are very superior. Currently, the Shanghai Banking and Financial Industries Association, including the Three Banks and Two Bureaus, has already subscribed to a total of US$40 million of these bonds. The pre-subscription vouchers for these bonds have been distributed to the entrusted banks and firms, and it is hoped that all sectors will actively subscribe to them.</p>
<h3>Director of the Public Debt Department Chen Bingzhang Discusses Fully Utilizing Public Debt Policies</h3>
<p>Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, answered several questions at the request of reporters from various newspapers. The main points are as follows: (1) The method for identifying the fineness of gold will be determined after consultation between the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. (2) The handling fee for each entrusted bank and firm for distribution has been determined to be one-thousandth of the bond issuance amount. The distribution method will be determined by the National Bank. (3) The bond proceeds collected by each bank and firm will be settled every ten days as stipulated. (4) The Fund Management Committee may be established in Shanghai next Tuesday, and Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance may personally attend the meeting at that time. (5) The US dollar bond fund has been instructed by the Ministry of Finance to the National Bank to allocate a certain amount of foreign exchange funds as collateral. Short-term treasury bills are secured by state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet assets. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Resources Committee, and the Enemy and Puppet Assets Handling Committee will negotiate and formulate methods, submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then submit them to the National Government for promulgation. (6) These bonds are intended to fully utilize public debt policies in principle and should be freely circulated. However, the time when they can be listed for trading still needs to wait until the formal bonds are printed before they can be put into use. (7) In principle, after any country issues public bonds, the price circulating in the market is always lower than the face value. Therefore, even if the market price of US dollar bonds is lower than the face value after issuance, this is not surprising, and it does not mean that the credit of the bonds is weak.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 9,400 dan (a unit of dry measure) of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The merchants' appetite for purchases strengthened, and production areas frequently increased prices, which were affected accordingly. Japonica and indica rice both continued to rise by CN¥2,000 to CN¥3,000. Flour also rose by more than CN¥1,000 due to high prices in the interior, poor transportation, and lively digestion. Foreign flour increased by another CN¥2,000. Bran sales in the surrounding countryside were active, increasing by about CN¥2,000. Soybean cake also rose with the increase in various items, increasing by CN¥1,300 to CN¥1,500 per step.</p>
<p>The oil market merchants' appetite was very refreshing, and it regained its vigor. Raw oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, and refined oil all rose uniformly by nearly CN¥10,000. Soybean oil factories had a rather greedy appetite for imports, and demand still exceeded supply, gradually rising. Soybeans and Chinese goods both increased by CN¥1,000 to CN¥2,000, and mung beans were also in short supply. Mung beans temporarily lacked glory, and cowpeas from Shantou became sluggish and fell back by CN¥1,000 to CN¥2,000.</p>
<p>Corn had little arrival and sales, and the price was stable. Red sorghum still had a good market for the mill, and the price increased by CN¥1,000. Sesame and foreign sesame were both crushed and increased by CN¥2,000 to CN¥3,000. Peanut kernels had a dull appetite in both foreign ports and local streets, and they were tired in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, with no significant fluctuations. Red beans were dull and stable, priced at CN¥1,000.</p>
<h3>Bulls Take Profits, Foreign Stocks Fall After Being Strong</h3>
<p>Trading in foreign stocks was slightly sluggish yesterday. People in the securities business intended to buy more shares, but many profit-taking bulls appeared, lacking support, and they fell after being strong. Ewo Silk opened at CN¥31,300, reached a high of CN¥31,700, and then was sold off sharply. The afternoon closed fell back to a low of CN¥29,100. After noon, it stabilized slightly. Apart from Ewo Silk being slightly active, He shares all lingered at low levels. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the industry generally fell back by slightly less than 10%, and the others fell by slightly more than 5%.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Tend to Consolidate, Mei Ya's Rise Is Particularly Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mei Ya's rise in Chinese stocks was still strong. The bulls were still waiting for an opportunity to increase their holdings in Yong Silk. Although it rose, it struggled more and was far less than Mei Ya. There were more transactions, and most of the major players in the industry were still waiting and watching. The trend was mostly consolidation, with each rising by half a percent, and the rest were flat or slightly rising.</p>
<p>It opened high in the morning, and then formed a consolidation pattern. Nos. 207, 97, 198, and 76 were in supply, and Nos. 94, 117, and 69 were purchased, and then struggled. Later, Nos. 145, 198, 31, 231, 169, and 219 were sold to CN¥2,425. Mei Ya was keenly bought by Nos. 223 and 117 and was quickly profitable. Nos. 97, 235, 160, 76, 2, 223, 24, 180, 198, 231, 102, and 4 all purchased, and then gradually raised to CN¥2,570. Nos. 95, 97, 219, 207, 198, 154, and 197 sold off, reducing to CN¥2,530.

<h3>Assisting Tea Merchants in Exporting; Permission to Increase Pledge Funds</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It has been learned that the largest principle for loans for tea exports in 1947 is to grant loans based on the value of raw tea for refined manufacturing, and then make export remittances based on the value of boxed tea. After arriving at the export location, pledge loans can be made. When exporting, packing loans are made based on letters of credit. All of these are to prevent non-tea merchants from applying for loans. The first stage of the loan requires raw tea to be eligible for application. The maximum loan limit is CN¥600,000 for Qihong, CN¥500,000 for Tunlv, and CN¥400,000 for Pingsi. As for the export tea of 1946, after the National Treasury could no longer bear the profits and losses of the purchase, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also sent a letter to the National Bank one day, stating that the purchase of export tea was not a matter of competing with the people for profits, so the original purchase plan was finally withdrawn. The National Bank sent a letter to the Executive Yuan on the third day to report the withdrawal of the original purchase plan, and also sent letters to the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and tea merchants for reference. However, in order to assist tea merchants in exporting, they are allowed to apply for additional loans from the China Farmers Bank. The limit is calculated based on the estimated pledge limit for export tea in 1947. The total amount of pledge funds is about CN¥20 billion or more. However, the original pledge funds must be deducted. The original pledge funds were CN¥350,000 for Qihong, CN¥280,000 for Tunlv, and CN¥200,000 for Pinglv, totaling more than CN¥14 billion. Now, Qihong has increased to CN¥480,000, Tunlv to CN¥400,000, and Pinglv to CN¥320,000, an increase of more than CN¥7 billion.</p>
<h3>International Monetary Fund Has Two Functions, US Government Supports It with All Its Strength</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Gu Shuiqun, the representative of our group to the International Monetary Fund, returned to Shanghai from the United States on the 3rd. When meeting with reporters, he stated that representatives from various countries are now returning to their respective countries to report their duties to their governments. In addition to reporting to the government this time, he also has important matters to discuss. However, Mr. Gu did not frequently disclose what the matters were, nor the nature and content of the discussions. He only said that he would stay in the country for about three or four weeks, and return to the United States after finishing his work.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu stated: The Monetary Fund officially started working in March, but its current approach is very cautious, so it is "not very lively". So far, the funds recognized by various countries have been paid successively, and exchange rates have also been mostly submitted. Those that have not yet been submitted, including our country, should not be delayed for too long. In terms of the contribution of the fund, it can be viewed from two aspects: The first function is that when countries have short-term imbalances in their foreign income and expenditure, the fund can help them; however, no country with any ability of its own would borrow from the fund, but would rather seek to balance itself with its own strength. Therefore, the role of the fund is no less than a "second reserve". The second function of the fund is more active, and it is especially meaningful at present. That is, representatives from various countries can meet at any time to exchange opinions and study various financial and fiscal issues of various countries, thereby enhancing understanding and sympathy. This method can solve some problems and increase the light of international economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Reporters asked: Since the death of President Roosevelt, the initiator of the fund, does the US government have sufficient enthusiasm for supporting the implementation of the monetary fund? Mr. Gu said: The US government not only has enthusiasm, but also has concrete measures. A National Advisory Council has now been established, with the heads of the Ministry of Finance, the State Department, the Ministry of Commerce, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the Export-Import Bank serving as members. The direct guidance given to the US personnel working in the fund shows the degree of importance attached to it. As for the attitude of the Soviet Union, it was inconsistent before and after. It participated in the meeting when the fund was established, but later its attitude became indifferent. It has not paid the fund and does not participate in the meeting. However, Mr. Gu believes that this is a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu believes that if the situation in our country becomes stable, the fund will be of great help to us. There is a good phenomenon at present, that is, the representatives of various countries in the fund deeply sympathize with our country's efforts to overcome economic difficulties. Regarding our country's future currency, Mr. Gu has two points of view: He believes that our country should participate in international cooperation, but at the same time, it must have a definite monetary policy. He also said that the future of the International Bank is very bright, and many large plans are being drafted. However, he avoided talking about the US$500 million loan, believing that it is not within his scope of duties.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Jiang Chun on the 20th Anniversary of His Death</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>Jiang Chun passed away on April 3rd of the sixteenth year [of the Republic], and today marks exactly twenty years. I can no longer avoid writing a few words to commemorate him.</p>
<p>Jiang Chun was my classmate, friend, and confidant. If the definition of "lover" isn't limited to the opposite sex, he was also my lover. In short, he was the closest person to me besides my own flesh and blood! I loved literature, and so did he. Together, we founded the "Mi Xiao Society". I loved traveling, and so did he. Although some of the things he loved, such as playing the violin, weren't always things I loved, it seemed that he was interested in everything I loved. For example, his interest in watching soccer wasn't as great as mine, but I often dragged him and his wife along. …</p>
<p>Whenever I faced difficulties, he would resolve them and make arrangements for me before I even had to say anything. Most simply, when I didn't have money to send home, he wouldn't wait for me to ask or pretend that he didn't know. At most, I would mention it to him, and he would definitely lend me money. Once he lent it, he would never ask me to repay it, and he wouldn't refuse when I returned it to him. He was truly someone I could rely on in times of need!</p>
<p>More importantly, he gave me countless comforts in my spirit. Two or three decades ago, I was someone who often complained, and it seemed that almost everything I encountered went against my wishes. It wasn't that my fate was bad, but rather that my temperament couldn't conform to the mundane world. Moreover, facing financial difficulties, I couldn't help but have to interact with people, even to the point of pleading and entrusting them. He exhausted his verbal explanations and practical assistance to stabilize me and encourage me to strive forward. When I spoke to others, my words might be ignored or even ridiculed and opposed. But when I spoke to him, it seemed that he always valued and agreed with me. Of course, many people disagreed with my actions, but in his eyes, they always seemed right. He always expressed his approval to my face, and always said I was right behind my back. In a word, emotionally, he had unconditional harmony with me!</p>
<p>Guan Zhong said, "My parents gave me life, Bao Shu knows me." I can't help but say, "My parents gave me life, Jiang Chun knows me." Unfortunately, he passed away twenty years ago at the age of twenty-odd, a promising age, due to typhoid fever!</p>
<p>However, after his death, I never wrote anything to commemorate him. At his memorial service, I didn't send a single couplet or banner. I never directly mentioned him in any other publications either. It's not that I couldn't write, but rather that I didn't want to write.</p>
<p>The reason I didn't want to write, of course, wasn't that I didn't want to write at all, but rather that "there was something to wait for". What was I waiting for? I was waiting for the ability to write freely and thoroughly, and for the ability to publish it and spread it far and wide immediately after writing it. I didn't want to write anything perfunctory. But that wait lasted twenty years!</p>
<p>In those twenty years, I was trapped and haggard in the struggle for survival for the first ten years. The last ten years, from the War of Resistance to the present, what kind of era is it? Everyone knows. Of course, I was still struggling. I couldn't write, and even if I wrote, I couldn't publish it. I could only wait, waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a miracle to appear, so that I could fulfill my long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>Has the opportunity come now? No! Has the miracle appeared? Even less so! But I feel that I can't wait any longer: the world is like this, "Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, who knows when that day will come!" And as for myself, looking in the mirror, my white hair is about to fill my forehead. I am old and decrepit, what am I still waiting for!</p>
<p>I have already written freely and thoroughly, and have already written four-fifths, or sixty to seventy thousand words, of what I planned to write. I hope to finish it this year. After finishing it, of course, there is no guarantee of a chance to publish it, and it is even more uncertain whether it can be passed down for a long time. But I think: as long as I write it well, everything else is no problem. Miracles will not appear (for example, none of Jiang Chun's other friends, or anyone else, will help me with this matter), but there will always be opportunities. If I can't publish it during my lifetime, perhaps my descendants will publish it for me. At the very least, my descendants will always keep the manuscripts I have written to commemorate Jiang Chun. Although not distant, it is long enough.</p>
<p>I won't wait any longer. On the 20th anniversary of his death, I want to write this short article to commemorate him first. In reality, he died too lonely. In these twenty years, I have not seen or heard anyone, including his family, express any commemoration of him. Of course, this short article of mine doesn't have much power, just as my million-word long novel may not have any power either, but at least I have done my best for him.</p>
<p>In these twenty years, I have commemorated him every moment. From now on, I will still commemorate him every moment! This is my true commemoration of him, not just on this one day of the 20th anniversary of his death!</p>
<p>Jiang Chun's surname was Qian, his given name was Rongsun, he was from Songjiang, a Bachelor of Laws from Soochow University, and he worked as a translator at the Commercial Press for many years. He founded Songjiang Junior High School and was one of the responsible persons of Songjiang Shanghai Jingxian Girls' High School. His writings are scattered in various publications, and I will collect them for him and publish a complete collection.</p>
<p>His relationship with society and the country should be written by someone else. If not, I will write it for him separately. I won't elaborate on it here.</p>
<h3>Oleander</h3>
<p>— Luo Ming</p>
<p>When I came to this house, I had a good impression of the three oleander trees that shaded the front yard. Later, I placed my desk by a window, and right outside this window was an oleander tree. Every day when I was free, I would lean against the window and watch it sway in a gentle breeze, or drop one or two crimson petals.</p>
<p>Friends who came to visit me also admired it, saying that the environment was good. The good environment was due to the oleander screen in front and the vegetable garden in the back.</p>
<p>However, I didn't have a good impression of the vegetable garden. I liked these three oleander trees. They grew so tall, taller than the surrounding wall. They were so lush and evergreen. They stood tall and vigorous, blooming beautiful peach-like flowers on their branches. However, they were not gentle or charming, nor did they spread fragrance to please people. They grew lonely in this garden.</p>
<p>Every day, I was delighted by the vigorous growth of the tender buds. When I was leisurely pacing in the garden, I often stroked the green leaves. I liked this shady color, which seemed to symbolize a life developing in hardship.</p>
<p>During cold, rainy evenings, I often felt deeply lonely. A dim yellow lamp accompanied me, the filament emitting a faint light and radiating a faint heat. I quietly recorded the day's life, or opened a book and crawled through the pages with my dull eyes. The sound of rain constantly interrupted my thoughts, and the depressing atmosphere suffocated and irritated me. So I opened the blinds, and a gust of cold wind blew in, waking me up from my desolation. Looking out, I could vaguely make out an oleander branch in the garden swaying painfully. Raindrops struck the leaves, sobbing and telling their story. As if enlightened, I began to understand that life grows in loneliness and in wind and rain. Therefore, I calmed down again, restrained my emotions, gently closed the window, and prepared to rest, as well as to prepare a portion of the enthusiasm needed for tomorrow's life.</p>
<p>Before long, autumn ended and winter arrived, and the oleander began to decline, with leaves falling one by one, falling very sparsely. However, it was still so verdant, the buds on the branches tightly wrapped, seemingly preparing to fight against the cold winter. I was not saddened by the falling of the old leaves, because the buds had not died, and the death of the old was just the beginning of the new growth.</p>
<p>It was another harsh day, with frost and snow flying, and thick snow piled up in the garden. Letting my frozen body bake by the stove, counting the years, I thought of my grandfather's white beard and my mother's coughing nights. I buried myself in chaotic and bitter memories. Raising my head, I saw the oleander standing in front of the window, burdened with snowflakes, heavily bent over. It was still so stubborn, neither withering its leaves nor breaking its waist, silently enduring the attacks of winter.</p>
<p>I felt ashamed, I felt that I was so weak and pathetic, not even having the courage of a living thing. I was incompetent, I was unable to stand in the blizzard, although I had faith in spring, but the days of winter were so unbearable.</p>
<p>In this room with a stove, I finally made it through this winter. Now, early spring has returned, and the oleander standing by the window is laughing and talking in the spring breeze, the seedlings have been opened by the spring wind and sprouted, and the green leaves are gradually adding new green young leaves.</p>
<p>I keep my faith, this will no longer be a flowerless spring. The oleander, this organism that symbolizes strong life, will bloom those lovely flowers that symbolize youth.</p>
<p>One warm spring morning, I broke off a branch of the oleander and inserted it on the table. I felt like I had received a dose of encouragement.</p>
<h3>Cold Food Festival and Qingming Festival</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>The Cold Food Festival, according to general legend, is associated with the story of Jie Zitui burning himself to death. However, according to the Zuo Zhuan and the Records of the Grand Historian, there was no such thing as Jie Zitui being burned to death. However, the Rites of Zhou says: "Now the Cold Food Festival follows the solar terms, which is the end of mid-spring, and Qingming is the beginning of the third month. However, burning fire is an old system of the Zhou Dynasty, and is not due to Jie Zitui." At the same time, the Rites of Zhou also has a slightly vague record, saying: "The Siju official in mid-spring uses a wooden clapper to repair fire prohibitions in the country, for the spring season when fire will be released." Because the fire ban is cold fire. The Cold Food Festival originated in ancient times, which is one explanation.</p>
<p>As for Jie Zitui embracing a tree and burning to death, Duke Wen of Jin mourned him: he issued an order throughout the country that no fire should be lit on the fifth day of May to mourn him. This is what is said in the Qin Cao. Whether Jie Zitui and Jie Zisui are the same person, and whether the fifth day of May is the day before the current Qingming Festival, remains to be verified.</p>
<p>The Chronicle of Seasonal Customs in Jingchu records: "One hundred and five days after the Winter Solstice, there is a strong wind, which is called the Cold Food Festival." In this way, according to the calendar calculation, it is two days before Qingming. However, Shen Quanqi's Cold Food Festival poem says: "Meeting the Cold Food Festival outside the mountains, spring comes but there is no sunshine. In Luoyang, the new Jiazi year, tomorrow is Qingming." Then, the Cold Food Festival is one hundred and six days after the Winter Solstice. There are also different theories about the duration of the fire ban. Emperor Wu of Wei's decree on punishment says: "One hundred and five days after the Winter Solstice, all fires must be extinguished for the Cold Food Festival." The Book of Later Han says: "Zhou Ju was transferred to the position of Inspector of Bingzhou... In mid-spring, the Cold Food Festival lasts for a month, which is unbearable for the old and the young." Lin Zhong Ji says: "To cut off fire for Jie Zitui, cold food for three days." Cutting off fire for one hundred and five days, considering the inconvenience of eating, is inhumane, especially in the cold regions of the north. It is said that one hundred and five days after the Winter Solstice refers to only one day, the 150th day after the Winter Solstice, and not one hundred and fifty days of extinguishing fire and eating cold food. Fortunately, this is a historical term in folk legends, and only old-style poets use it as material for chanting, and its actual life has long been cut off.</p>
<p>The Qingming Festival has a long history. The most popular poem is Du Mu's Qingming poem: "During the Qingming Festival, it rains incessantly, and the travelers on the road are heartbroken! May I ask where there is a tavern, and the shepherd boy points to Xinghua Village." Ouyang Xiu's Butterfly Loves Flowers lyrics: "Rain accumulates and wind rages at the end of the third month, the door closes at dusk; there is no way to keep spring. Tearful eyes ask the flowers, but the flowers do not speak, and the messy red flies over the swing." What a sad and moving verse, making people feel the scene of the Cold Food and Qingming Festivals.</p>
<p>Sweeping tombs during the Qingming Festival is a custom of the last few hundred years, and not a ritual that has existed since ancient times. For example, when Cai Yong saw Emperor Ling visiting the mausoleum, he was awe-struck and said to others: "Although tomb worship is not found in ancient times, it may as well be created." Later, Emperor Wen of Wei and Emperor Xuan of Jin, Peng Jingzhi, a Doctor of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices in the Tang Dynasty, and Tang Shaodu advocated that "tomb worship is not allowed by the three rites, and should be prohibited." The two took extreme positions. But now, sweeping tombs and worshiping tombs has become a common thing. Every spring and autumn festival, people go to sweep tombs in various places and visit the tombs of relatives and friends to express their remembrance, which is still a more normal ritual.</p>

It also says: But thank the people in the scenery, come to visit the scenery outside the people. Refine the stones to mend.

Ji Tang chants. Liangfen's poems have a sequel to the Tang Collection.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 308</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Of course it's tense..." Tsurumi cut off Zheng Yan's words, "Everyone is preparing to get promoted and make a fortune, and if they don't take the opportunity to make their instruments sound louder, they're afraid they won't be able to perform on stage..." Tsurumi sneered, "Taking the lives of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or hundreds of millions of people to exchange for their fame, this deal is very cost-effective!" Tsurumi expressed his deep regret, pondered for a while, and then asked Zheng Yan, "Tokyo, Shenyang, do we have our own news?"</p>
<p>"Yes; '〇十二' and '〇二' are paying special attention to the development of the situation; Hasegawa's news was sent by '〇十二'. In Shenyang, what is worth noting is the advance of the army to Shanxi; '〇二' said that the captain has a plan to transplant the trunk line..."</p>
<p>"Yes, pre-decoration and relocation of a part of Peiping, there are several new experts, and a large group of people is being organized; the strength is very strong and the supply is considered sufficient. Oh..." Tsurumi seemed to remember something, his sword-like eyebrows furrowed together, and at the same time he looked at his watch, "Huh... where did she go?"</p>
<p>Zheng Yan didn't know who Tsurumi was asking about, so he didn't dare to answer. Tsurumi jumped up from his seat and handed the strange note on the ground to Zheng Yan, "Can you decipher it?" He then opened the door and clapped his hands. Tsurumi used the old-fashioned method to greet the maid because he saw that most of the furnishings here were old-fashioned Japanese.</p>
<p>The maid did not respond. As Zheng Yan was staring at the note in a daze, he suddenly realized that Tsurumi was clapping his hands to greet the maid, so he immediately jumped up from the chair, glanced around, saw a light switch on the side of the door, and went forward to press it a couple of times, still staring at the strange note:</p>
<p>"The Hualu Hotel is one of the large hotels opened by Westerners."</p>
<p>"Where is it?" Tsurumi looked at Lin Zheng Yan, but his expression was obviously a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"In the central district, at the mouth of the Bund," Zheng Yan replied, "This number is strange, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the hotel."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"No road in Shanghai has this number, and no residential area or hotel room would have this number - no strange number starting with '〇'." Lin Zheng Yan was very sure.</p>
<p>"Ha... besides the house number, do you have any other insights?" Tsurumi asked.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I can't guess... did this note was left by the lady who came with the captain?" Zheng Yan carefully placed the note on the table.</p>
<p>"Oh... I forgot to tell you;" Tsurumi briefly explained what happened when he disembarked in the morning in a few words.</p>
<p>"I can ask a friend to inquire about this. He may be able to explain..."</p>
<p>Tsurumi was about to ask who this friend was, but he found that the maid was already standing outside the door.</p>
<p>"Please come in," Tsurumi nodded to the maid, "I want to ask you something, that is: Has Miss Nakamura returned?" Tsurumi's words were a little rambling, which shows that his mind was confused.</p>
<p>"No,..." the maid seemed very happy.</p>
<p>"I know, did you hear Miss Nakamura say where she was going?"</p>
<p>The maid was still trying to recall, but Lin Zheng Yan interjected:</p>
<p>"I did hear that... Miss Nakamura seemed to have asked the steward below, "How long does it take to go to the embassy by car?... How far is the Bimao Hotel from the embassy?" etc."</p>
<h3>Competing with Old Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ye Lin</p>
<p>Many people are glad that this war did not cause excessively serious damage to Shanghai. In fact, this is a short-sighted statement. This war exhausted the construction of the city, causing the construction of our city to stop for ten years, and even now it is still in a state of semi-stagnation. These ten years have caused the phenomenon of "crowding" and "chaos" in our city today.</p>
<p>Originally, "crowding" and "chaos" can be overcome by the three-dimensional and planar construction and development of the city, but today, none of us dare to or can have such extravagant hopes. Therefore, although this is a metropolis, vacant land still exists in the urban area. Therefore, although this is a city that never sleeps, dilapidated villages are at the end of the street and around the suburbs. Everyone will feel that such a city, such prosperity of the city is built on the extravagant enjoyment of a few and the many unemployed.</p>
<p>Therefore, our city cannot maintain order and tranquility, and balance of state. The housing shortage has caused worker anemia, narrow roads have frozen pedestrians and vehicles, the recession has caused factories to close, employees to lose their jobs, and high prices have formed an inevitable phenomenon: the desertedness of department stores, and the sales figures cannot rise in proportion to prices, because unemployment, the freezing of indexes, and the meager general treatment have limited purchasing power.</p>
<p>Before the war, when the concessions existed, the Ziju had a Weixin, establishing a new city center to reduce and weaken the status and value of the concessions. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the municipal government has also entered the central area. Competition seems to no longer need to exist. In fact, competition should be deeper and broader, because our city is facing a crisis, and should compete on a larger scale with "crowding" and "chaos", with housing shortages, with streets that are too narrow, with too many traffic accidents, with the recession of industry and commerce, and with the unemployment of two or three million people.</p>
<p>Only when this competition is won can it truly be a victory for Greater Shanghai.</p>

<h3>On the Rule of Law</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Recently, I received a package of books from America, wrapped in an old newspaper. Upon opening it, I found it was a September 29, 1943, issue of the New York Herald Tribune. In an inconspicuous corner of the back page, there was a news item:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Claire Clancy, an elderly woman residing at 2033 Queens Boulevard, in this city, went to Cliffner Park in Nakamura on March 12, 1941, for recreation. On that day, due to heavy snow, Mrs. Clancy slipped and fell by the roadside, injuring the tendons in her right leg. After being treated in the hospital, she recovered after six months. Upon discharge, she hired a lawyer to sue the New York City government, accusing it of negligence in failing to sweep the streets, resulting in injury to pedestrians, and demanding compensation for damages. After more than a year of litigation and repeated trials, the Queens Supreme Court finally rendered a verdict yesterday, finding the Mrs. Clancy's accusations to be completely reasonable, and ordering the city government to compensate Mrs. Clancy for damages of $12,500. Furthermore, because the husband lost his wife's domestic labor during her hospital stay, the city government should also compensate $2,500 for this loss of domestic life."</p>
<p>The reasons the Supreme Court based its ruling on were: The main purpose of people paying taxes to the city government is for the city government to maintain public order, street cleanliness, and the safety of citizens within the city. The city government's failure to sweep the streets, resulting in injury to pedestrians, is the city government's fault, so it should be responsible for compensation.</p>
<p>This seems like a very ordinary matter to Americans, otherwise this news wouldn't have been printed in an inconspicuous place, but in our opinion, it is quite an extraordinary news story.</p>
<p>The rule of law is not only about people obeying the law, but also about the government obeying the law. People who break the law will naturally be punished by the law, and the government is the same. Despite the many shady dealings in American politics, it truly respects the rights of the people.</p>
<h3>Two Monks</h3>
<p>— Xuan Shi</p>
<p>Two monks from Jing'an Temple, De Wu and Mi Jia, were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for treason. A certain evening newspaper added a sentence after the verdict, "Appropriately reserve living expenses for family members." This was probably because the same thing was written so many times that such a stroke was unconsciously added. In fact, the two monks (in the verdict) had no family members, so their property can be said to have been exceptionally completely confiscated.</p>
<p>Since monks have renounced the world, of course they have no family members. However, in this society, it is not easy to truly renounce the world. Not to mention monks who do not abide by the precepts and keep wives and concubines, even those truly solitary monks, how can they truly renounce the world? For example, the two monks above, although they have no dependents, they also have private property. With private property, they naturally have all the desires and troubles of laypeople. They are called renunciates, but in fact they have never truly left the circle of home.</p>
<p>This is still a minor saying. Renunciates are supposed to be free of worldly concerns, but reality is reality after all, and cannot be escaped. They can escape the small home of the family, but they cannot escape the large home of the country. The two monks above could not avoid being affected during the country's difficult times. Just because they took a path that violated national policy, they became two traitors. Similarly, Master Taixu is also a renunciate, and he also cannot escape the circle of the country. However, he is walking the same path taken by the entire country, and therefore he has become a hero of the resistance against Japan. Some people call him a political monk, but in this era, it is not very possible to have no relationship with politics. If monks are like this, then we laypeople who are not monks are even more so.</p>

<h3>"From Black Night to Dawn"</h3>
<p>— Wu Bian</p>
<p>Recently, many films have depicted underground workers as new heroes. The protagonist of this film, "From Black Night to Dawn," Zhu De, an underground worker, engaged in sabotage against collaborators and puppet regimes in the occupied areas during the Anti-Japanese War. After being arrested, he led his comrades in a prison break. After the victory, he led a group of refugees in building roads, eliminating local tyrants, and working hard for rural construction. However, when we look through the newspapers, what kind of clownish faces do we often see in those who call themselves underground workers?</p>
<p>We do not deny the contribution of underground workers to the country's resistance against Japan during the war, but in this script, the author's depiction of Wang De is too deified. His escape from the enemy's prison happened to lead him to the home of the collaborator Huang Yimin (who was the informant who reported him to the enemy and caused his arrest), and he even happened to break into his daughter's room. When the enemy came into the room to search, they did not find him. However, in the scene, the enemy knocked on the door for a long time before Wang De opened the door, while the collaborator's daughter was sitting by the window far from the door. So who opened the door? Wouldn't the enemy find it suspicious? Then the enemy squad leader came in to solicit favors and was killed by Wang De with a vase. Wouldn't the translator and others outside the door hear any sound from inside the room? All of this makes it impossible for the audience to believe its possibility. And the arrangement of the plot is also coincidental everywhere, which inevitably weakens the truthfulness of the story.</p>
<p>Huang Mulan, the daughter of the collaborator, became a progressive girl after running away with Zhu De. After the victory, she strived to "take care of the children for everyone during the day and teach everyone to read at night," but in the picture, her beautiful and fashionable clothes, who can believe that she is a worker who goes deep into the people?</p>
<p>In short, this only exaggeratedly praises individual heroism, without the power of the broad masses. However, the collaborator in the author's writing later transformed himself and became the post-victory village chief, doing all kinds of evil. The arrangement of this character is the best part of the whole play.</p>
<p>It is touted as being performed by the entire cast of "Top Secret," but obviously this play is a failure. The looseness of the story and the weakness of the director's handling of the whole play are what doomed the fate of this play.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Qingming Festival</h3>
<p>— Fei Chen</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the Chinese people have been influenced by Confucianism and Buddhism, believing that those who "behave as human beings" must fulfill "filial piety." If they fail to "support" their ancestors wholeheartedly "during their lifetime," then they must find ways to "honor their ancestors and elevate their family after death."</p>
<p>Returning to the ancestral tombs to "sweep the graves" during the Qingming Festival is also a way to honor the family and show off in the village.</p>
<p>But in this 20th century, in the 1950s, these descendants are tumbling in the great torrent of history. Some have lost their fields and destroyed their homes in wars and unemployment waves. Facing the lush ancestral tombs, how will they weep bitterly!</p>
<p>Some, although they wore the crown of betraying the nation in the war, those who know the times are heroes, and they still return home in glory. If the ancestors knew, would they be angry or ashamed to face such descendants?</p>
<p>Some sons and daughters have not had enough clothes or food for the past ten years, and have been struggling for half their lives. Today they can [illegible] before the spirits of their ancestors, will they cry [illegible], or will they sob silently?</p>
<p>If today's "Qingming Festival" is still "bitter rain and desolation," then most of the descendants on the road will have no tears to cry for the sake of life and future.</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Lan herself had not told Lao Zhu about these situations; rather, Lao Zhu had found out from the conversations of Xu Shaoming and his wife, and Fei Fei.</p>
<p>The commotion in the small alley gradually subsided, but outside on Liuhe Road, it was already a scene of busy traffic again. Separated by a large courtyard, Lao Zhu could constantly hear the sounds of cars and people clamoring.</p>
<p>He sat alone on the bamboo couch, deep in thought, and couldn't think of any good solutions for a while. He sighed, jumped up, put on his khaki Hawaiian shirt, and casually took a toffee from his pocket and put it in his mouth. Then he picked up the cold water bottle on the table and drank three or four mouthfuls in a row.</p>
<p>"5111..." He walked down from the narrow and broken wooden ladder, unconsciously whistling again.</p>
<p>Only one school worker was left in the elementary school, and he had not yet gotten up. He opened the gate himself and walked onto the street.</p>
<p>The blue-gray dawn shone all over the suburbs of Guilin, the mountains were still so clear, the water was still so beautiful, but the people were so chaotic! After walking through Liuhe Road and turning onto Jiangan Road, what he saw before him was simply a surging sea of people, cars, goods, and luggage. No one was not rushing around in a panic, and no car was not heavily loaded with all kinds of things. Lao Zhu felt a chill in his heart, and felt that this scene was somewhat ominous.</p>
<p>Those exquisitely beautiful small Western-style houses in the Dongjiang District were all in a mess, and the well-maintained flower beds were trampled beyond recognition.</p>
<p>"Okay! Poor people. Keep accumulating! Keep plundering! Keep reveling! See when you will wake up!" He, a poor dramatist, really felt like the happiest person in the world at this moment! No family, no property, no goods, and no insatiable greed. Now he could coldly watch those guys who were usually obsessed with profit and greed, scurrying away like dogs who lost their homes.</p>
<p>After crossing the Dongjiang Bridge, he stood at the bridge pier, hesitating and unable to decide where to go first, when he suddenly heard a woman's voice calling him. Before he could turn around to look, a small car that wasn't very new had already driven up to him.</p>
<p>A woman with curly hair jumped out of the car, and Lao Zhu's eyes lit up. It turned out to be Jin Aili. Having not seen her for three days, Jin Aili had changed. Her original shabby clothes had been replaced with bright new clothes, and she looked much more energetic. There was a hint of joy in her eyebrows and eyes.</p>
<p>"Lao Zhu, where are you going?" She smiled charmingly at him, originally wanting to reach out and shake Lao Zhu's hand, but immediately seemed to remember that there was a driver watching in the car, so she temporarily retracted her hand. (3)(5)</p>
