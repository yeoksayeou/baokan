<h3>日郵務人員　集團曠職擴大</h3>
<p>﹝新亞社東京廿六日電〕日遞信省工作人員之集團曠職，自二十日起開始時，包裹間工作入員之簽到辦公者，即减至約百分之四十，其程雖表面不以根據勞動組合之指令之方式，而以之爲各工作人員自動之行爲，連日美團曠職，更形擴大。辦公者已不過百分之二十至三十。二十日東京中央郵政局未送出之包裏達二千件，而連日又增加不已，故二十五日遞信省發表不收寄往許多地區之包裏，新聞，雜誌等大型郵件。</p>
<h3>日片山首相　解釋新刑法　廢止對日皇不敬罪</h3>
<p>﹝新亞社東京廿六日電﹞日本改正至新刑法將於本日公佈。片山首相廿五日接見新聞記者時特就此發表談話稱，「此次改正之要點如下：　廢止對外國元首及使節制特別罪；　廢止對天皇之不敬罪；　加強對言論出版之保護；　廢止通姦罪。惟對外國元首及使節仍尊重其尊嚴，根據一般法律，充分取締不敬行爲，廢止對天皇之不敬罪，係根據日本憲法之民主性而廢止特殊罪名。至於保護言論出版，並非由此即許可不良之出版之謂，廢止通姦罪亦非承認爲合法行爲，而通姦在道德上乃屬不正當之仃爲，故在民法上承認其爲離婚之理由之一。</p>
<h3>三黨國代候選人名單　月底可提交選總　僑胞選舉辦法決予變通</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕民靑兩黨提交政府之國代候選人名單中跨黨份子（即原爲國民黨黨員者），業經兩黨允予取消其候選人資格並另行選補，但兩黨表示在去年國大以前之所謂跨黨份子，應不于道究，國大之後而有跨黨之行爲者，則取消其爲候選之資格。因此原定本月二十六日以前送交全國總所之政黨候選人名單，勢非延期不可，現民，靑兩黨何日提出　訂之名單，尚不可知，但國民黨方面則希望於三日內提父，俾於月底前以三黨聯合名單向選舉主管機關提出。</p>
<p>﹝又電〕海外僑胞參加選舉之問題，迄未獲具體結果。僑民選舉事務所業將各各華僑听在地辦理選舉之實際困難情形，呈報總選所，轉呈國府，請示進行辦法。國外僑胞究應採何種方式參加選舉、中央仍在考慮中。爲運行直接普選之原則，而以通訊方式投票選舉，似非適當，在各國國土內行使公民權，亦非可行，中央或將暫行變更僑民選舉之程序，以不喹十二月廿五日召開國大爲原則。(其他有　選舉消息刋二版四欄）</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統的呼籲</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統鑒於歐洲期待援助的迫切與國內通貨膨脹的警人，　乃決定於十一月十七日召開國會舉行特別會議，共商緊急援助計畫的實施以及遏止國內物價的上漲。同時又於二十四日夜間，向美國人民發表演說，立時明當前國內外的局勢；一方面指出，美國國內生活費用的高漲，足以威脅國內的繁榮；另一方面又宣稱，海外人類的饑寒與受苦，美國必需予以援助。最後並敦請全國人民自動節省糧食，以救濟海外的人民。</p>
<p>美國政府當局如此關切歐洲人民的饑寒，並將立即採取行動，以減輕歐洲人民的痛苦，站在人道的立場上，聽聽杜魯門總統的演說，終不能不認為這是歐洲人民的福音。歐洲各國在這次大戰期間，受盡了納粹德國的蹂躪，受盡了砲火的摧毀，在物質上所受的損失，實非數字所能估計；尤其是法國與義大利，可謂民窮財盡，國計民生，都已到了山窮水盡的地步；美元的缺乏，使她們無法取得國內貨物的輸入，維持她們最低的需要。戰後歐洲各國的窮閑，本來可使她們全神貫注於經濟的複興，而不致被被捲入國際紛爭的業渦；但因戰後國際局勢的演變，欲求舊時的安定也不可行。所以歐洲若幹窮困的國家，仍在國際的紛爭中沉浮，這實在是人類的一大悲劇。</p>
<p>戰後各國均將遭受饑寒的痛苦，原為世人意料所及，故在大戰期間，就有組織「聯總」計畫的倡導，戰後聯總雖也曾發揮其救濟戰災各國的功能，但終未能拯救人類脫離苦海，而聯總在歐洲早已結束，歐洲人民饑寒交迫，依舊如故，馬歇爾國務卿的援歐計畫，論理可以獲得歐洲各國人民的歡迎與喝彩，但是又因國際上的紛爭使其遭遇到極大的陰撓，至今還沒有實施，尙待美國國會的討論。現在美國當局又在那裏大聲疾呼緊急援助歐洲了，照目前歐洲的實際情形而論，似乎不致再遭受阻力；但是國際上紛爭，仍足以構成杜魯門總統實施緊急援助歐洲的障礙。據合衆社紐約二十六日電稱，蘇聯對美國將展開其全面的外交攻勢，其迫切之目標，乃在擊敗馬歇爾的經濟歐計畫。我們拋開一切不論，只談歐洲各國窮困的情形，急待外國予以援助，現有富有之國，一本其悲天憫人的胸懷，願意予以援助；若有他國，不僅袖手旁觀，而且企圖從中破壞，不論站在那一方面，終覺得這種行為不入道。</p>
<p>今日歐洲問題的症結，一言以蔽之，乃在美蘇兩國的爭取領導權，因此造成積不相容的局面，美蘇對於歐洲任何問題，無不抱着相左的態度，不要說戰後歐洲所發生的問題，得不到合理的解決；就是世界各國均有切身利害關係的對德和約問題，至今仍陷於僵局，無法打開。而且蘇聯早已在歐洲樹立鐵幕，不僅使鐵幕以外的人不能通過鐵幕，登堂入室，而且連鐵幕以內的一切活動，也無法探悉。戰後世人莫不期望「一個世界」的實現，對於歐洲期望尤切；但因鐵幕的存在，使兩個陣營的對立，更為明顯。從新共產國際在華沙發表的宣言看來，蘇、法、義、匈、羅、南、保、波蘭暨捷克九國共產黨共同奮鬥的目的，乃在反對美國的援歐計畫。</p>
<p>我們在馬歇爾的援歐計畫發表之後，早已看到蘇聯報章雜志的反對論議，在蘇聯的眼中看來，美國的援助歐洲，就無異於役使歐洲，誰願意接受美國的援助，就是甘願為美國的奴隸，這種論議竟能引起歐洲八國共產黨的共鳴，乃在蘇聯領導之下，成立新共產國際，針對　美國的金元外並發動反攻，在鐵幕以內的若干國家，受了蘇聯的控制，早已身不由主，參加新共產國際，原不足為奇；但是　兩國的共產黨，竟不顧人民的痛苦及法義國的利斧，也加入新共產國際，無怪乎要受到國人的唾棄了。法義兩國共產黨的陷於迷途，適足以證明今日的歐洲尙徘徊於十字路口，對於今後將何去何從？還不能當機立斷呢？歐洲若干人士猶抱著這種狐疑的態度，確實足以增加美國人民對於援歐問題的顧慮。</p>
<p>但是我們也要美國朝野反躬自省一下，歐洲各國窮困的情形，已臻於極點，所謂「饑者易為食，渴者易為飲」，為什麼歐洲若干國家　於美國的援助，仍抱着狐疑的態度呢？我們拋開國際紛爭的因素不談，美國也不能不負相當的責任。我們首先要美國人民明瞭，強權政治時代的外交作風，在第二次大戰結束之後，早就不應該存在了。在美人的腦海裏，造成不能存着「金元外交」的陳舊觀念，「在金錢上援助你，在政治上就得聽我說話」；否則歐洲各國實願饑餓而死，而不願接受美國的援助。我們固然相信美國援助歐洲，純粹出於人類的同情人，而絲毫不含有任何的作用在內，但是在外交的作風上，我們仍不得不　請美國當局特別加以注意。以美國援華問題而論，我們也深深地感到同樣的痛苦。</p>
<p>要之，歐洲的冬天，轉瞬將屆，饑寒交迫的慘狀，又將出現於人類的眼前；杜魯門總統的呼聲，確是歐洲人民的福音；但是馬歇爾援歐計畫如何能貫滿？　我們但願美國國會能立即覓獲圓滿的辦法。</p>

<h3>高雄港　沿革及現狀</h3>
<p>高雄港為台灣以及華南唯一優良海港，張院長於二十九年前遊覽高雄港時，尙稱「打狗」，正在築港。溯荷人於明萬曆末年間，佔據北港，一八六　〇年天津條約後，英國復以廈門為踏腳石而進入高雄，設立海關，德人亦於　山建燈塔。日佔台灣時以高壓力　場土地，費時四十年，經營此南方唯一咽喉，於是由海的時代進入為太平洋時代。</p>
<p>高雄臨港一帶均屬平原，氣候溫和，多晴少雨，重工業工廠大部設於此，港南有沙堤，長達十二公里，寬二百公尺，與外港隔絕，形成天然防波堤。港內面積六萬六千平方公尺。港口狹一〇六公尺，戰時以日本人利用為南進基地，故遭破壞達百分之九十，光複後經港務局打撈沉船一百七十艘，港內外予以清理，諸如信號，浮標，浮筒，碼頭，倉庫，起重機沿港鐵路栰橋等，大部修複完竣，目前可同時繫靠萬噸以下船只二十九艘，倉庫可容　貨物十二萬四千噸。本年一月至八月，船舶進出五一一艘，共九一六，一七五噸，現下更積極加強　港工程，本年底萬噸以下船舶可望自由進出，並着手增設夜航設備。該港不但須負荷當地鋁，　，肥料，制碱，造船，水泥，煤油等　出產品與原料輸入，且本省南部特富米及水果，除供應本省自用外，且可大量輸出，尤以糖　為大宗，該港得天時之利，為　糖唯一之出口港。本年七月間，全國航政會議決定將高雄　國際貿易港，吞吐國內外物資，故港務局現已擬定三期擴展計畫，使於二年內建成健全之國際貿易港。惟該港受損太甚，前美籍專家勘察結果，認為若以美國之雄厚實力，其複興亦須在三年以上，故須一改支離破碎海港之景像，顯大獲得最磊這經濟援助不可。</p>

<h3>基隆肥料廠現況</h3>
<p>第一廠：為台灣肥料公司最重要之製造廠，廠地設於基隆市外禾山，佔地一六五點二九為平方公尺。重要設備有六點〇〇〇KW　兩座，每座日產電石四十公噸，液化空氣機一座，每小時可產氫氣一點〇〇〇立方公尺，氧氣二五〇立方公尺，　　化　爐十二座，每座日產三公噸半，石灰窯一座，日產石灰七十公噸。戰時被炸甚烈，現已修複，明年起可望年產氫氣化鈣三五點〇〇〇公噸，較日治時增加二分之一。</p>
<p>第二廠：戰前生產品有硫酸，過燐酸鉀，及其他各種配合肥料，年產濃硫酸八〇〇公噸，過磷酸鈣一六點〇〇〇公噸，各種配合肥料二〇點〇〇〇公噸，戰時被炸，現僅存硫化鐵　三座，每座日燃七五〇〇公斤硫化鐵礦石，製造磷酸鈣之設備已蕩然無存。接收後去年二月着手修復，八月月間即製造硫酸磷肥，可年產一五點〇〇〇公噸。</p>
<h3>張院長在基隆演說詞</h3>
<p>〔上接一版〕余於廿九年前來台灣時，亦曾在基隆留住一宵。彼是余所住之官舍，現已炸毀。今日回憶過去，感觸極多。過去半世紀中，台胞遭受日本帝國主義之壓迫，基隆市又複被毀於戰爭。所幸，台灣現已光複，諸君今已成為享有自由平等之中國國民。基隆乃遠東之東要海港，無論平時在經濟方面，或戰時在軍事方面，皆有重大價值。此次戰爭中，基隆損失特大，其理由亦即在此。吾人今後必須重建基隆市，成為我國之軍要海港。」</p>
<h3>魏道明廣播詞中所述台生產狀況</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿六日電〕台省主席魏道明昨下午廣播中曾列興趣各項重要生產數字，說明台省光復兩年來之進步情形。據魏氏稱，臺糖生產量，雖在日本　據時最高達到一百餘萬噸，但吾人接收時，生產已完全陷於依賴。今年度可望恢復產量至卅餘萬噸。茶葉在接收時全年僅產一百四十三萬公斤，電力在接收時僅能　電四萬三千　，今年則增至二十一萬　，煤炭在接收時每月僅產一萬四千噸，今年增產至每月十一萬噸，全年可產一百三十餘萬噸，水泥在接收時每年只產六萬噸，現已增至全年十六萬噸，鳳梨在接收時只產二萬六千八百噸，今年可產四萬二千六百餘噸，上述皆係較為重要之生產　業，其他如交通道路等，亦均有顯著之進步。</p>

<h3>白崇禧播講　回敎忠孝節意義</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕廿五日為世界伊斯蘭敎「忠孝節」，全國回敎協會理事長白崇禧，於當日下午八時假中央廣播電台，對全國回胞廣播忠孝節的意義與希望，略謂：「忠孝節」有譯為「禮祀節」或「犧牲節」的，犧牲節是全世界穆斯林紀念以布拉欣聖人服從主命，以斯　儀服從父伯的偉大忠孝事蹟，要是按照事實的涵義，用中國的倫理觀念和術語來詮釋，乃是聖祖以布拉欣「視令如命」，以斯瑪儀「視死如歸」，一門忠孝的盛事，所以中國回敎協會為使意義更為明白起見，便譯為忠孝節了。按忠的涵義很廣，如忠於主宰，忠於領袖，忠於國家，忠於職守，忠於人民，忠於朋友等等，我們待人接物，涉身處世，隨時隨地都需要忠實，所以「忠」是我們立身之本。其次，能孝於親者，才能友於兄弟要，然後才能發揮「老吉老，以及人之老，幼吉幼，以及人之幼」的召感，和人類慈愛和平，精誠團結，一視同仁的偉大首先，所以「孝」是齊家之本，能修身齊家，然後才能談治國平天下之的道理，而且能盡孝的人，才能盡忠。中國古代選忠臣必於孝子之門，意義是很深長的，所以孝宇意義擴大，仍然是忠，忠孝二字，原是不可分的，因此古蘭經訓「孝親」，僅次於「事主」，忠孝的首先應為人類共同的倫理原則，我可以說，人類如果不實踐忠孝的敎訓，即無世界，更談不到國家民族了。現在有一部分武裝叛亂的共匪，不服從最高領袖的命令，破壞國家統一，擾害地方治安，使全國同胞處於水深火熱之中，對民族為不孝，我們應當肅清他，我希望全國敎胞，大家本着忠孝敎訓，犧牲精神負起戡亂救國的責任來。</p>

<h3>戰後德國　訪世界女靑年大會德國代表</h3>
<p>— 本報記者洪絮才</p>
<p>在杭州召開的世界女靑年會代表大會中，有一個德國代表蔡娜克女士，她是唯一的戰敗國的代表，因為日本雖也受大會邀請，但因遭遇東管　制委會反對，未能成行。無疑地，蔡女士將成為新聞的中心人物，但她是全場中。最沉默最孤獨的一位代表，有一個墨西哥代表吿訴記者：「她的眼睛既大且圓，眼珠呆滯，說話聲音低微沙啞，德國女人真可憐哪」！</p>
<p>本月二十一日的夜晚，我探獲了她的住所後，便悄悄地跑到西冷飯店去訪她。這是旅館中最小的房間，裏面除了一張床及桌椅各一外，便沒有空隙了，在暗淡的燈光底下，看到蔡女士灰白的頭髪，和枯幹多縐的額角，估計她該是五十以上的老婦人了。</p>
<p>我說明來意，她立即很客氣地接待了我，請我坐在床沿上，開始述說德國人為何在艱難中度着淒涼的歲月。她說：「窮啊！餓啊！我們每天吃了早餐，就再也不會有午飯和晚飯，現在的德國人要是有一天不餓，這就是個奇跡。」她的聲調異常沙啞而且　急，且時時因劇烈的咳嗽而中斷，但她總是竭力設法抑制住，並　描：</p>
<p>德國在蘇蘇法美四國統治之下，全境已被分成四部份，人民皆不能自由來往，現時德國到處都鬧房荒，煤荒，糧食荒，所以每個部分都不准人口入移，致妻離子散，一家不得團聚者極多，德國經大轟炸後，完整住房已寥寥無幾，人民中有到親戚家暫避者，現豐均無法回去。蔡女士來自柏林，現時柏林為盟軍總部所在地，所以房荒更形嚴重，人民多籍斷壁殘垣遮蔽風雨，加上氣候異常寒冷，白天辦公室中墨水凍結可達六小時，因去冬無煤，致活活被凍死者，僅柏林一地，已達一千五百餘人。她說：「我永遠不會忘記，去冬的一個深夜，我恍惚聽見附近有顫抖的呼救聲，翌晨有二個婦人凍死了。」</p>
<p>記者實在不願多聽這些悲慘的故事，我打斷了她，請她說一些戰時婦女的生活情形。她憤慨地說：希特勒的輕視女性，是顯而易見的，在戰事之前，他把婦女當作生育的工具，規定每家不得少於四個孩子，父親的薪水，須以孩子的多少為標準，強迫婦女回廚房去，戰事起了，他把十七歲以上的男子全部徵去作戰，婦女就必須操勞一切的苦工。</p>
<p>蔡女士是德國女靑年女靑年會主席，所以記者問她在希特勒統治之下，靑年會是否也曾受到摧殘呢？她的回答是：「只有讀聖經和做禱吿的自由」，德國人民有百分之卅五是基督徒，然而他們是不允許有任何組織的，連三個人同時走在路上的自由都沒有，蔡女士曾數度被傅，盤問達數晝夜，有一位女靑年會幹事，因為在路上談論到厭惡戰爭而被判徒刑。</p>
<p>這時候，她的情緒憶漸趨激昂，聲音更加沙啞，她一字一頓的說：「德國人民如何在納粹統治之下磨難和煎熬，是超乎你們想像能力以外的，當柏林遭大轟炸時，我們有整整四十晝夜沒有睡覺，那情景，如颶風暴雨，如火山迸發，如天之將坍，我簡直無法形容它有多少恐怖……」</p>
<p>記者問：「你相信希特勒真死了嗎？」</p>
<p>她肯定地回答：「百分之一百，我有絕對的把握，這一類人是不可能再活在如今這個世界裏了。」</p>
<p>記者又問：「嚴冬將屆，柏林今冬情形可能好轉嗎？」</p>
<p>她聳了聳雙肩，搖着頭回答：「我不知道，但我們日夜祈禱，並深信上帝會願意我們活下去的。」</p>
<p>她突然抬起頭來看天，時正殘月高掛，寒意自窗外襲來，夜已深了，我向這位老婦人道聲「晚安」，帶着沉重的心情，踏着枯黄的残葉歸來。</p>

<h3>蘇聯抵制國際重要活動　聯合國未見隱伏　目前蘇聯不致賀然退盟　惟東歐諸過遲造將與聯合國脫輻</h3>
<p>合衆社紐約廿六日電）聯合國若干代表及舊金山會議開始即注意聯合國之外交觀察家，頃有一相同之觀點，即蘇聯事實上刻正「逐步自聯合國撤退。」惟在可見之將來，不致正式放棄其會　，蘇聯將儘可能長期留在聯合國內，以利用此國際組織，作爲試探思想之工具。同時，蘇聯及其　　國正逐漸拒絕參加聯合國之特別讓你無，此政策可名為「抵制技術。」由此蘇聯及其衛星國拒絕參預聯合國之四大計劃，並抵制若干重要之輔助性活動。蘇聯拒絕參加托管理事會爲時一年，其理由爲託管協定草案之完成，未　蘇聯磋商，故蘇聯不同意參加草案之實施。蘇聯復稱，託管協定並未賦予不獨立人民足以達到自治階段之機會。第二方面，蘇聯與波蘭率直拒絕參加經濟政治委會通過而聯大必予核准之巴爾幹調查團，調査團尚虛位以待此兩國，然彼等決不參加，二國及其他東歐國家亦決不與調查團合作。第三方面，在起草終年舉行會議討論和平安全問題之「小型聯大」章程之小組委會中，蘇聯亦有一席地，然蘇聯亦拒絕參加，而堅稱小型聯大之計劃「實係非法，且與聯合國憲翠抵觸」。蘇聯及其衛星國担絕與之發生關緊。第四方面，蘇聯已聲明將抵制朝鮮委員會，委員會之任務係在監視韓國之選舉及美蘇軍隊之撤退。依目前之情况，聯大將通過美國此項提案，若然，則蘇聯拒絕合作之機構，又將增加一個。據悉，最後美國將在南韓建立政府，並使之具有軍隊，以防禦在北韓蘇區之親蘇團體，雖無人（包括美人）希望分裂韓國，然一般承認，依現下局面，此事將爲合乎邏輯之結果。除抵制聯合國重要機構外，蘇聯及其衛星國且拒絕參加若干輔助性組織。藏聯早已拒絕參加日內瓦國際貿易局大會，上星期六又宣佈拒絕參加年底貿易局召開哈伐那貿易會議。蘇聯抵制國聯難民局，並拒絕與其他聯合國有關團體合作。然多數代表僉信蘇聯將永不放棄其聯合國會員籍，除非東西集團澈底分裂，被逼而出此。蘇聯之所以不退盟，除擬利用聯合國作爲發表其見解之論壇外，並有一大考慮，即無人敢正式爲破滅舉世美夢之作俑者。雖然，一般意見以爲蘇聯之在聯合國已成爲多數國家之反對勢力，必有一日蘇聯或由於自動或由於被動，將脫離世界紐織而獨樹一幟。</p>
<h3>聯合國大會成交戰場　蘇對美展開攻勢　潘友新使美配合新戰略</h3>
<p>（合衆社紐約十月廿六日電）聯現已對美國展開世界規模之全面外交攻勢。目前聯大辯論益形激烈，而蘇聯在歐洲之宣傳亦已廣泛展開。關於蘇聯外交攻勢之初步目標，已由於政治局委員日丹諾夫予以坦白闡明。氏儼然已爲戰後蘇聯思想界發言人，並代表蘇聯出席歐洲九國共產黨華沙會議。渠稱：蘇聯外交政策之迫切目標，爲擊敗馬歇爾經濟援歐計劃。蘇聯外交代表現已全面行動蘇聯宣傳之主要講合爲聯合國大會外交次長維辛斯基，其主要助手　羅米柯，烏克蘭外長曼努伊斯基（曼氏一度曾為一九四三年解散之共產國際負責人之一）及其他人物，均已發表滔滔不絕之演說。莫斯科決定派潘友新爲駐美大使，蓋亦與比全面攻勢有關。潘友新爲蘇聯外交界新進，入外交界不過六七年，由一九三九至一九四四年曾任駐華大使，其後因病返國，病愈後則在外交部任職。由日丹偌夫在波瀾之聲明及維辛斯基在成功胡之演詞觀之，則蘇聯已不耐於作「冷酷戰爭」中採取外交守勢，此事己屬明白之至。</p>
<p>（聯合社北平廿六日電）蘇聯前駐華大使潘友新出任駐美大使一事，此間熟悉潘氏之外國人士一致表示歡迎，但亦均表驚奇。若輩認為潘氏非嚴峻人物，且個性謙和，並無外交家之特殊性格，及具大學教授風度，表面上為嚴備，但絕不傲慢。</p>
<h3>小型大會設置案　我國提建議　限於處理情勢問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約二十五日電〕中法兩國今聯合國中，建議「小型大會」不得考慮一切「糾紛」問題，蓋「情勢」實不若「糾紛」之迫急也。中國代理首席代表顧維鈞本日告起草小組委會稱，「倘擬議之小型大會獲有考慮關於「斜紛」之問題之權力，則可能引起對設置小型大會之　正目的之懷疑。顧大使復發疑間，「倘小型大會考慮關於糾紛之間題，則是否可能降低大會之道義地位。顧氏謂，渠所憧憬之小型太會，主要爲實施全體大會之決議之機構，其職資雖諒將包括關於糾紛之議題，然非待大會討論後，不得接受此種議題。</p>
<h3>聯大三國委會　自澳抵吧城　印尼拒絕荷機降落日意</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿六日電〕聯合國斡旋印荷之三國委員會幹部九人，今日下午自雪梨飛抵吧城，荷印政府及東印尼政府均遣代表往迎，印尼共和國政府則無代表在機塲迎迓。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿六日電〕安尼泰通訊社報告荷印政府昨廣播稱，戰事發生時，印尼方面軍事聯絡員十七人曾被荷方扣留，故要求印尼共和政府允許荷機一架在日惹降落，交還此十七名軍官。印尼政府頃已訓令在巴達雜亞之　總理蓋尼，於廿六日通知荷方，事實上拒絕荷蘭之建議，而稱逕可由國際紅會代理此事。</p>
<h3>蘇聯或將建議盟軍退出德國</h3>
<p>（合衆社倫敦廿六日電〕據英國權威方面消息，蘇聯在十一月外長會議中，或得提議盟撤出德國。觀察家相信蘇聯提出撤兵建議，係企圖獲得全世界輿論對蘇聯政策表同情，據稱，蘇聯最近提議盟軍撤出朝鮮，業已獲得好感。英方稱無論朝鮮或德國蘇軍撤出後，已能有親蘇之强大政治組織在此等地區活動。通過反黷武法案</p>
<h3>巴伐里亞邦　通過反武法案</h3>
<p>（聯合社慕尼黑廿五日電）巴伐里亞邦　會今日一致通過法案，准許人民有權拒絕主動或被動參加作戰。巴伐里亞人民對於普營土人迫其接受　武主義，數有年來深表不滿，此次立法在德國史上尚屬　舉。</p>
<p>德境蘇軍佔區仍有反攻部隊</p>
<p>〔聯合社　尼黑廿五日電〕波蘭流亡政府某要員前來巴伐里亞省遊歷，談及蘇佔區情形，略謂蘇聯軍隊背後，至少有五萬反共隊伍，正在進行游擊戰爭。</p>
<h3>英代表率直勸告蘇聯　應放棄褊狹觀念　譴責戰販案今日付表決</h3>
<p>（聯合社成功湖廿五日電）聯合國政委會今日就蘇聯提出反對戰爭販子一案，舉行初次試驗投票，結果廿九票對十二票，拒絕以該案提交起草小組會，拉丁美四國，印度與阿比西尼亞加入蘇聯集國爲少數派。該案將於星期一正式表決，各代表預料並無通渦希望。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿五日電〕英國今日控訴蘇聯「毒害」聯合國之空氣，並要求明確答覆。蘇聯控制歐亞兩洲由易北河至海參崴之地區後，是否仍不能滿足其安全感。英代表麥克尼爾在大會上要求蘇聯領袖棄其「憎恨政策」。</p>
<p>渠稱，如蘇需要和平，則應相信非共產黨員並不等於法西斯主義者，而獨佔資本家亦不等於游擊隊。麥氏此言，係在西方諾國反擊蘇聯提出譴責戰爭販子建議之鬥爭最後階段中發表。麥氏要求維辛斯華撒回其建議。此靑年外交家蓋即英外部第二號人物，渠認為蘇聯人民能有機會藉新聞自由以發表其觀感，則發生新戰爭之機會將大减矣。在一般討論中，美國反對聯大通過任何溫和之決議案最烈，蓋美國認爲任何決議案，將使蘇聯認爲渠又獲勝利，且任何決議案將等於承認西方列強確有散播戰爭宣傳之嫌，雜辛斯基現在準備作最後攻擊</p>
<h3>眞理報無消息消息報無真理</h3>
<p>（路透社成功湖廿五日電）聯大政委會繼續辯論蘇聯所提之「戰販」決議案，英國及南非代表對於蘇聯之宣傳方法，均有猛烈之抨擊。英代表麥克尼爾稱，渠對維辛斯基之使用「剪刀漿糊」方法，對於報章文字斷章取義，深表反對。但若蘇聯喜用此等方法，則渠亦將報以同樣方法。於是麥氏遂節述蘇聯報章之言論，以證蘇聯報章對於英代表　克羅斯及其他代表在聯合國機構中之言論，極盡曲解之能事。並曰「余代表英國之報人鄭重否認英國報人從事虛僞報道之說，維辛斯基極善援用俄羅斯成語，余知有一俄人之成語，乃「「眞理報」無消息，「消息報」「無眞理。」</p>
<h3>戰爭販子定義隨時季而變動</h3>
<p>麥氏並爲土耳共癖護，對於維辛斯基之罔顧禮儀，抨擊土代表賽伯，深覺痛惡。蓋强國決不應使用此等方式攻擎較小國家，因而增加業已存在的誤解。人人均知土耳其於積極發展共民主制度之際，並同時以顯著的勇氣，反航蘇聯　其發動了大規模　經　。述及戰爭宜傳之問題時，麥氏並要求經明戰爭販子之定養。麥氏於此特別指出莫曰洛托夫於一九三九年德蘇互不侵犯條約簽訂後曾發表演說，指責同盟國對德國發動帝團主　　爭。渠又指出正當英法向德國作殊死戰時，莫洛托夫又嘗指英法之社會黨領袖若艾　禮，勃　姆等為戰陣取子，縣見蘇聯之戰爭販子定義，係隨時季而變動，</p>
<h3>美國慶祝海軍節　武器戰術將澈底革新</h3>
<p>（聯合社華盛頓廿七日電）今日爲美國海軍節，海軍當局現擬實行海軍歷史一百七十二年來之根本革命，設計新式軍艦，武器與戰術。其要點有三：即研究主力艦潛水方法，配備原子彈之火箭，超光速之飛機以及在必要時肅淸天空。超光速戰術問題尤其重要，海軍部　已發明一種數字自動速算法，是以解決該點，但因嚴守秘密，詳情無從探悉。</p>
<h3>法市選舉行二次投票　戴高樂仍佔優勢　赫里歐再度膺選里昂市長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：巴黎訊，法國約九千城村之市政選舉，可於今日完成，戴高樂之「人民聯盟」仍佔優勢，壓倒共產黨。根據最近統計，所獲票數約佔全部票數之百分之四十。法鐵路工人協會星期一將集會，務必達到增加工資百分之十一之目的，工務員中央協會則將提出總罷工建議，上述組織，均屬於共黨所領導之勞工聯合會者。工人之拗執態度，對共黨競選顯有不利影響。</p>
<p>（合衆社巴黎廿六日電）法國人口在九千以下之小鎭一萬四千座，廿六日舉行市政選舉，法國之法律規定，在小鎭中獲選應具有絕對之多數。廿六日之選舉係由鎭民就上星期日初步選舉中得票最多之候選人中加以抉擇。在金風颯爽中，法人情緒高漲，參加政治戰爭，共黨與戴高樂派以死力相搏，而社曾黨則竭力設法改善其兩黨間之地位。政治觀察家預測，上屆市政選舉中，共黨任市長者等一千七百人，此次雖在農村大事宣傳，由於法農民傳統之保守性，共黨恐將失去其市長席之半數。國民議曾主席赫禮歐廿六日重行當選爲里昂市長，按渠任此職已逾二十年。</p>
<h3>賴瑪迪政府臨嚴重危機　議會明復會命運可決定</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿五日電〕法國國民議會奉召討論賴瑪迪總理所稱之對於法國制度及內部和平所感受之威脅，定於星期二提前十六日復會。個瑪迪總理業已整肅其內開，以更堅決地抵抗要求增加工資之壓力，並實施緊縮措施。國民議會所將面臨之局勢，已因下列二大發展而愈呈念迫：　共產情報局之在貝爾格特成立，法共之加緊反對政府及共黨控制之全國總工會之要求普遍增加工資，　美元危機之愈益尖銳化，　戴高樂所領導人民團結運動之脫頴而出。惟此種複維微妙的政治局勢，當不能長久拖延。就政府之立場言，如欲加以廓淸，當有賴於政府之採取肯定堅決之措施。</p>

<p>路透社巴黎廿五日電）法議會極右派議員領袖慕德，已於今日向國民議會秘書處提出要求政府解散共產黨之決議案。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電）商務部長兼審查馬歇爾計劃之總統顧問委員會主席哈里受今日談稱：渠所領導之委員會，業已確認若千歐洲國家之要求應予修改若千可予整個接受，若干將子暫時拒絕，若于要求須予以减少，使其所要求之物品，得與美國此等物品之供應量相符。哈氏復謂：渠之委員會於審査巴黎會議之報告後，已就有關馬歇爾計劃之主要問題成立協議，委員會定十一月五日舉行末次會議，通過委員會之最後報告書，呈覆杜魯門總統。</p>

<p>（中央社安加拉廿五日電）右派「素描」報今稱，寇特族武裝暴徒於前昨兩夜，侵略土國疆界，襲擊哈台附近之村莊，土國農民」一死亡，數人受傷。該報稱，蘇聯利用土耳其與該族雙方歷史性科紛，煽動不利於土國之寇特民族主義。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫數廿五日電〕英國海軍部今日發表報告稱：希特勒曾於一九四一年親自命令德國海軍避免與美國艦隊發生一切事端，意欲進免對美戰爭，以待擎敗蘇聯爲止。希特勒甚至在故總統羅斯福擴大美國海軍活動至冰島之後，尚欲展延在大西洋之行動，厥後日本襲擊珍珠港時，希魔仍擬避免公開價突。海軍部報告之材料，得自戰時抄獲之德國檔案。其中透露希魔對征服蘇聯，極具信心，認爲一九四一年九月底蘇聯即可失敗。東錢戰役結東後，即可保特對美國採取嚴厲行動之機利。</p>
<h3>保加利亞祖國陣綫發表宣言抨擊英美</h3>
<p>〔聯合社保加利亞京城廿五日電〕祖國陣綫委員會近日製表宣言稱：世界各國已組成兩大陣營，一面為帝國主義者陣營，另一方面反帝國或民主陣營。前者由美國領導，志在從經濟與政治上制服因戰爭而破壞及貧窮之國家，窒息其民主政治，重建反動與法西斯力量之統治。保國受希　與土耳其之束縛，該函國已化為英帝國主義者之基地，實爲我國及巴爾幹其他民主國家獨立　安全之經常威脅。</p>
<p>孰爲友人，孰爲敵人，今日每一誠實之國民均能了然。美人憶及英美帝國主義者在一九四五年對保國議會選舉出以不公正的干涉，巴黎和會時，若　復對保國出以數對態度，若輩在希　國際調查團中之行爲，及其關于保國國奸貝特柯天案之粗暴千涉，凡此種種，均已不打自招，鑒于上述國際形勢，祖國陣綫委員會與陣綫內容各黨一致宣布，保國之重大利益與大蘇聯領導的反帝國陣營完全一致。</p>

<h3>索賭債要照米價先下手結果一命　新北門殺人慘案十小時三犯俱獲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新北門安仁街六十四號，昨晨四時四十分許，突發生一男子被人暗殺血案，計身中十餘刀之多，氣息奄奄，橫臥路側，因時在黎明，行人稀少，兇手於肇事後從容逸去，未幾邑廟警分局福佑路派出所崗警，聞訊到塲，急召車將傷者舁送仁濟醫院急救，祇說：我名沈杏賓，卅四幾，湖州人行兇者徐杏林·張阿三·沈阿二·三名在城內喬家路英雄口琴廠爲廚司云云。延至昨午十一時許，卒以傷勢過重，不治身死。嗣邑廟警分局沈·陳正副局長據報，即飭刑事股長周南跴緝，當由巡官司賈文林齊警長白慶祥，警員洪宇澄，章明輝，李學淮，劉志誠等，赴出事地點調查後，拾得</p>
<p>手指一枚</p>
<p>及死者遺留綱綫袋，內貯肥皂等用品，帶局呈案，繼往喬家路一一〇號上海口琴廠賬房問調查名冊，獲悉徐杏林其人，係由魏陳三介紹入廠爲飯司務，即傳魏詢問，據供：天未破曉時徐伴送同鄉人沈杏賓至北車站，迄未歸來，徐有友在成都路六十八弄六十一號華成造罐廠做工，乃由警員伴魏至該廠查訪，</p>
<p>不得要領</p>
<p>繼復偕至呂班路花園邨四號徐友沈宏仁處調查，再從沈處致電在復興中路六一弄三號爲女傭魏之表姊楊氏，詢徐有否來過？答云在此。警員乃即乘車趕往，當塲將徐杏林·張阿三·沈阿二三人，一併拘獲，帶局偵查。徐供認砍斃沈杏賓不讀，據云：我與沈杏寶均係湖州島鎭人，正月間爲財牌九，我與姪兒阿三賭負，向沈吿貸三萬元。</p>
<p>迄未歸楚</p>
<p>詎廿三日沈由鄉來滬，至口琴廠向我索欠一萬五千元，要照米價計算，非一担不可，我乃向其商量至十一日返鄉料理，徐不允，並謂如果不還，我要燒你房子。說罷就走。翌日我因張阿三，沈阿二也曾吃過他的虧，乃與兩人商量，皆稱我們不如先下手爲强，如果不殺他，我們</p>
<p>要被他害</p>
<p>廿五日下午，沈復來廠，云明天搭早車下鄉，你的錢有否，我回答他凖定十一月還他，他就說十一月我是不答應，我當時忍氣吞聲，殷勤敷衍，留他宿在我處。至昨晨黎明四時許，伊起身欲赴車站搭車，我與張，沈假裝送伊至站，由張阿三取菜刀一把，暗藏身畔，中途張將該刀交我，迨行抵安仁街六十四號門口，我對凖徐之頭頂，方欲</p>
<p>舉刀下砍</p>
<p>不料被其轉身將刀奪去，反向張阿三砍來，致張之右手大拇指，削去少許，繼我竭力將刀搶回，並由張，沈兩人協助，將其雙手拖住，連續砍其頭，面，四肢等處十餘刀，始踣地不起，僅存一息。我等亟向楊家柵弄逃去，不敢回廠工作，下午同至張楊氏處，擬借用資潛回湖州鄉間，不料突被捕獲云云。是案發生，以迄兇手全部落綱，爲時僅十小時，可謂速矣。</p>

<h3>浦東棉田面積擴展　紗花工廠改良進步</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕陰雨霏霏中，隨中國紡建公司副總經理吳味經，和農林部棉產改進處處長胡竟良兩氏，出發浦東，對該區的棉田，軋花廠，紗廠等，作了一整天的巡禮。從上午九時起，到下午七時的十個鐘點中，在顛簸的吉普中，也不過走了楊思，周浦，南匯，新塲四處，看了一家紗廠，四家軋花廠，和一些零星的棉田。</p>
<p>吉普跨下塘橋渡口時，第一個目的地，就直指楊思區的恒大紗廠。這廠也有廿七年的歷史了。廠房尙新，機器還是一九一九年份Lowell牌的。現有紗錠二一六〇〇錠，開足一八〇〇〇錠，平均每十小時產紗〇·八磅。現在正計劃在本年底前，全部改裝中國標準式大牽伸設備。改裝費每錠須扯法幣四十萬元。明年秋前，該廠所定新紗錠一九四七年英貨Smelly牌一萬錠，可望裝到。目前棉紗產品，以紅飛機彩飛機牌六支，十六支，廿支紗爲主。本年初又新添面機四百台，現正試開六十台，專出十二磅細布，大致明年底可望開足。</p>
<p>看過的四家軋花廠，一家是楊思區的恒源與軋花廠，一家是周浦的正昌軋花廠，一家是南匯的申久軋花廠，最後的是新塲的榮昌軋花廠。值得一提的，是申久軋花廠。該廠除原有老廠外，現又添置葢了新廠，並向美國買到了整套最新式的氣流式鋸齒軋花機。這種美式卅二吋徑的軋花機，每部能力相當於我國同時徑輥軸軋花機四十部。牠的特，在從吸進籽花起，到打包階段爲止，全部利用機器動作。皮花，棉籽，皮壳，均能自動分開彙集，毋勞多費人力。這整套軋花機，現在裝置已裝完成，約在三星期內，可以試車，每天最高的軋花量，可產皮花二千担。可稱國內獨步的新軋花設備。</p>
<p>棉產方面，奉賢南匯沙各地合計本年約可產廿五萬担，據花商說：今年年成好，較去年可增收三成。不過比較戰前年產六十萬担之數，又不免相形見絀了。產量以南匯佔首，約佔總產量二分之一，次爲奉賢，川沙最少。農林部棉產改進處的改良棉種，本年也首次的哥廣東省推廣。計奉賢周浦推廣柯字棉七千畝，川沙南匯推廣德字棉八千畝，兩共一萬五千畝，估計改良棉花可產五千担。</p>
<p>籽花價格最高時，每担到過七十四萬元，昨日價格爲六十三萬五千元。照這種價計算，皮花每担已扯三百三十萬元。改良棉花比這種價格再加三成。照這種價格計算下來，種棉花的利潤，已超過種米的多多。所以一般的估計，明年棉田將大大增加。</p>

<h3>恐怖的職業　美化女屍　業園殯儀館黃小姐談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕樂園殯儀館裏有一位黃小姐，年紀三十上下，風韻楚楚有致，鼻上架着一副金絲邊眼鏡，打扮得很文靜，行動也很溫和，好像一個女敎員，她常坐在賬房間裏電話總機邊上，替人家接綫，人家以爲她是不負衆望館裏一個普通女職員，其實她學有專長，她的職務是專門替女屍首清潔·化裝·注射消毒等工作，無論黑夜白天，她總是一個人在一間小房間裏，對着屍首，解衣穿衣，洗浴化裝，從來不叫人帮助，這種工作是謝絕參觀的，殯儀館只有她一個女人，所以女人的事只有她一個人來幹。有時生意忙了，一連接來三四個女客，黃小姐周旋其間，分別替她們洗浴洗面，拍粉點脂，打扮得如花如玉，陳屍堂上，大家都說面色如生，漂亮不减當年，那裏知道這是黃小姐的辛苦呢？聽說有一次同時來了兩個女屍，一個正在打扮，一個身子忽然牽動起來，眼睛似張，嘴唇一動一動，膽小朋友，眞要嚇出魂來，黃小姐若無其事的對她看着，她倒不動了，詳細檢查，業已死透死透，並無還希望，於是相應不理。據說確有一個老太婆到她手裏又還陽的，但是不到兩天，又朝來的路上去了。這次記者因爲筱丹桂的新聞，又去訪問了一次黃小姐，據黃小姐說，這一次筱丹桂的飾終典禮，都是她一手經辦的。她認爲報紙上有許多記載主誇張了，而且與事實大不相符。第一筱丹桂的一具棺材，是向紹興會館永錫堂買的，並非楠木，也非沙方，叫做梓木。價值不過三四千萬元，外傳一億五千萬，因此到現在還有人事誠去參觀棺材的。第二含口的東西，呌做含口菱，是一個銅質金色的小菱，面積不過像一粒荳板樣大，根本不值錢。大都是壽衣店家作贈品的，外傳口含一兩重金菱一只，亦非事實。第三手握銅質金元寶，銀元寶各一只，也是假貨。其他東西如身前所穿的旗袍二十餘件，化裝品，香水，玻璃粉盒等，那倒是有的，不過都非值錢東西，還有衣服上釘的珠子，那是最起碼的小珠子，僅值二三千元一粒。最後黃小姐說：這次最晦氣的是樂園殯儀館，損失桌椅，門窗，花木等約值二億左右，到現在還沒有人來理這一筆賬呢！記者於黃小姐嘆氣聲中吿辭，黃小姐追出來高聲說道：「拜託新聞記者先生，在報上提一筆，要他們快來賠償呢」。</p>
<h3>筱丹桂飾終情形外傳多不實　樂園損失二萬萬元無人償還</h3>
<h3>心理學專家孫貴定播講羣衆心理檢討</h3>
<p>足以推翻專制政體不能建設自由國家　足以毀滅一切罪惡不能創造任何福利</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨假座九九電台舉行第三十次特別廣播，請心理學專家名敎授孫貴定博士播講「羣衆心理的檢討」，茲紀錄其演詞大意如左：</p>
<p>什麼是羣衆？一般人以爲許多人聚在一起就是羣衆，這是不對的。羣衆的構成有其一定的條件：（一）集中在一個地方有同一目標者，（二）有共同情感者，（三）其行動足以發生影響與刺激者，例如南京路上熙熙攘攘的人羣，來來往往，各人有各人的目的，這不算是羣衆，假如發生大火，許多人有同一看大火的目標，同樣有好奇心及恐怖心，這許多人就是羣衆。</p>
<p>行動不得自由</p>
<p>個人在羣衆當中，受羣衆的暗示力量很大，在羣衆當中，個人的行動不得自由，同時因同情心作用，個性湮沒，所以一個人在羣衆當中完全是沒有個性而失去理智的。一個有經驗的演說家走進羣衆的塲合，先要看看是在露天禮堂，因爲環境的不同，羣衆的反應也不同。有經驗的演說家能够針對不同的塲合而對羣衆作適度的刺激，個人心理和羣衆心理完全不同，個人是溫和謙恭的，到了羣衆裏面，常常變得粗暴而不講禮貌了，甚至事後自己也要詫異爲什麼在羣衆中有這樣大的改變，失掉本來的面目。</p>
<p>主張善於改變</p>
<p>現在，來檢討一下羣衆心理的四個特徵：（一）羣衆是反覆無常的羣衆與有組織的團體不同，成千成萬的羣衆，會因一塲大雨而各自散去，毫無踪跡。羣衆在情緒激昂的時候，會因外來的影響而改變自己的主張。法國有名的史學家Tain，在他的菱當中描寫巴黎羣衆暴動的一段，他說「巴黎一條街上擁護着很多的羣衆，指明一個女人是反動份子，要殺死她，一個老翁說你們不要殘暴吧，她不過是一個女人。於是羣衆嚷起來說這個老翁就是反動份子，轉過來要殺死他，忽然從當中跳出一個　三，說這個女人就是老翁的女兒，羣衆聽了發狂的大笑，有人灣下腰笑痛了肚皮，一天大事化爲鳥有了。」羣衆就是這樣善變的。</p>
<p>失去控制能力</p>
<p>（二）羣衆是輕信的，在羣衆面前不必講道理，因爲他們分析和批判的能力都失去了，一個不正確的意見在羣衆中提出來，不經考慮的就被接受了。（三）羣衆是頭腦簡單的，和羣衆講話，只要斬釘截鐵的幾句話就够了，如果用「假使」「然而」等拖泥帶水的話，羣衆就感到討厭，一個善於支配羣衆頭腦的煽動者，對羣衆只要簡單的說「打倒某某」「擁護某某」就够了。（四）羣衆是不道德的，因爲羣衆已經失去控制自己約束自己的能力，而且個人在羣衆中做的事情不必要負責任，所以容易放肆，越軌，所謂「暴行」就是從這一個心理下產生的。美國名敎授洛斯Ross有兩名名言：「羣衆有力量可以推翻專制的政體但不能建設自由的國家。羣衆可以毀滅一切的罪惡，但不能創造任何福利。」</p>

<h3>宿遷的寳藏石英</h3>
<p>〔本報宿遷廿日訊〕靑　的馬陵山脈，承着沂蒙山脈的餘緒，蜿蜒在駱馬湖的旁邊，一直伸張到宿遷城。這裏有一個很大的富藏，它是玻璃的家鄕——石英礦。記者此次一到宿遷，馬上就和視察團　鸞翔團長及董建華縣長等乘專車到產區去參觀。</p>
<p>白馬澗　藏量最</p>
<p>石英的產區，就目前知道的，是在馬陵山脈的周　都有蘊藏。南北約三十餘華里，東西約二十華里，面積約六百餘方里。以前有一位外籍專家，曾佔計其藏量足供世界三十年之用。</p>
<p>我們跨過了六塘河，公路兩旁的泥土下面，即有不純粹的石英發現，現在這六百方里以內的地區，據　縣長說，差不多全是如此。但是　量最豐富的要算白馬澗。</p>
<p>用土法　開採淘製</p>
<p>白馬澗只是一個地名，沒有村落。那裏有很多的溝和洲，中間還有很少量的水在流着。在這許多溝和澗的兩面土層當中，就是潔白的石英。有的離地面只有數寸，最厚的也不過三四尺。現在工廠還沒有設立，只有一些當地人用土法開採淘製，很少量的運到上海。因為　地好，所以很受廠方的歡迎。我們在白馬澗就增到有一堆堆石英，經過淘洗之後，它外頭呈着不規則的細粒狀。</p>
<p>張季直　經營成績</p>
<p>關於過去開採的經過，有一段很長的歷史。在光緒三十年七月，南通張季直先生和許九香，黃伯雨等幾位，集資五十萬兩，呈請前淸商部南洋大臣准予開設耀徐玻璃公司。光緒卅二年七月正式開工，由黃伯雨任經理。製造品以平面玻璃，及玻璃燈眾爲主，成績很不錯。辛亥革命後，因受戰爭影響，營業不振，遂於民國元年停辦。</p>
<p>訪遺址　渺無覓處</p>
<p>該廠設於運河北岸，廠基二百餘畝，房　約六百餘間。停辦以後，廠地，機器等，仍有專人保管。一直到民國廿七年宿遷淪陷。有漢奸吳子雲（僞宿遷縣第八區區長)串通敵齋藤部隊，將機件由敵人拆運。房屋由由吳逆全部拆賣。現在瓦　無存，欲訪遺址，蓋已渺不可得。</p>
<p>玻璃校　一度開辦</p>
<p>戰前在宿遷，還有一個玻璃職業學校，也是張季直先生創辦的儀器多而完備。抗戰期間，已損失了一部份，有一部份事先埋到地下的，因時間過久，標記　沒，現在正尋覓中。學校校址，在城之西南，從前的試驗室，現在只有一個大烟肉在　立着，機件，房屋，什麼也沒有了。</p>
<p>玻璃機　運費無着</p>
<p>去年十月，聯總有人來宿遷視察，會表示可以以玻璃機兩架，無條件供給使用，可是當時這兩架機器的運費，即需四十餘億，這在貧窮的縣城裏，是無論如何。負擔不起的。這個計劃因此便告吹</p>
<p>籌備會　策劃開採</p>
<p>可是，玻璃亮晶晶的光，始終在宿遷人們的內心中閃耀着。他舞認為這是一個國家的富源，因為曾經有人估計過這裏的藏量，要推為世界第二位。他舞現在正組織籌備會，準備向省方及資源委員會建議早日策劃開採，以利地方而增國富。(特派記者凌松壽）</p>

<h3>南海發現童匪　腰掛短槍　威脅柴船</h3>
<p>〔本賴廣州廿二日航訊〕雈苻遍地之廣東，入秋以來，匪勢益張，各江河道輸船被刦者，日有所聞，尤足使人駭異者，　為無法無天之童匪出現，緣南海縣屬南福附近冬瓜吼，銀河等一帶河而，近日刧殺頻仍，凡各江柴船經過每隻勒收「保護行水費」二十萬元，如有拒不繳交船隻，即將柴船扣留或開槍掃射，而盤據該處之匪帮，竟供爲年約十二三歲之小童，一律穿着黃斜衫褲，腰配短槍，儼然梁山泊好漢。據識者言：此批童匪嘯聚約近百人，係敵偽時代大　「護沙大隊長」　公綽餘孽指揮，大部係匪徒之子女，可謂「世盜」。該地區位處南海番禺順德三縣交界，久爲大匪帶出沒地帶，自發現此帮童匪後，竟使柴商裏足不前，牽通廣州近日柴價高漲，亦可謂亂世一個新鏡頭。</p>
<p>又據揭陽來客談：揭陽縣屬謝厝寮村張某，日前在該村五里外之祖山開坑之際，忽掘起一木棺，外表均已腐爛，以手捻棺，隨手粉碎，度常爲二百年前之舊棺，乃其中之尸體絲增未化，形骸依然，死者爲一個二八少女，面目姣好如生，但衣服觸手盡行霉爛，五官四肢均極完好，一時開棺者，竟至驚愕不知所措。當地善堂得訊，急具香楮牲醴前往致祭，並爲女另易衣冠，重築隹城，鄕人紛往叩祭，惜無碑識，不知此女爲何許人耳。(記者梁小中)</p>
<h3>閩農業改進處　發動冬耕</h3>
<p>〔本報福州廿二日訊〕閩省農民本無冬耕習慣，惟近年來由於農產缺乏，農村困苦及政府積極推動之結果，從事冬耕者漸多。省農業改進處，近正發動大規模冬耕計劃，組織督導團，分赴各縣指導農民，今年推廣之冬耕作物，據悉：除大豆小麥等類外，將以「綠肥」為主，此項「綠肥」為野生豆類作物，有紫雲英等廿餘種，搖種後無須施肥，即可自行繁旭，俟其成孰時，將其翻耕於泥土內，即成天然肥料，可使來年春耕作物，獲得巨量增產，閩西北農田使用此項肥料，巳著成效。又閩省農出虫害堪虞，該處將協助農胞防治。</p>

<h3>搶救安陽棉花　鬧了一塲糾紛</h3>
<p>〔本報鄭州廿日訊〕由飛機搶運留在安陽的一萬包棉化的事情，剛剛在昨天給束。可是在結束中，却鬧了一塲糾紛。因爲當時中美公司負責人陳納德肯派飛　搶運安陽棉花，是聽了搶救委會的人說，要拿出百分之十五的所値，來救濟安陽逃鄭學生，同時試會也開了一張支票給墨生，說搶出棉花後，每一學生應得棉大衣一件，棉被一條。如今棉花擔出來了，但只肯給每一學生救濟費五十萬元。安陽學生憤憤不平，跟到一位姓劉的國大代表(安陽人)的地方去訴苦，並要求他主持公道。</p>
<p>據說：安陽棉花運出來的雖然一萬包，但其中一部份是某部隊的，因此商人有一部份棉花還沒有運出來，同時還吃了一個虧，就是五百多包棉花雖還沒有遝出來，却由商人負責攤款償付了，因此救濟費的數目更减少了。在分配救濟費中，有些不識相的機關與無聊的人也去爭沾，弄得搶救會更爲難，結果只有出之以登報鳴謝的辦法，以免開罪於要不到錢的一些人。</p>

<h3>周鯁生對滬校友談　武大四研究所　擬大規模擴充設備　使成爲華中學術硏究中心</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕武大校長周經生，赴京出席院士評議會，日前來滬。該校上海校友會監理事，昨假南京路四明銀行儲蓄部舉行歡宴，資委會會計處長張直夫教授亦應邀作陪。席間周氏表示當教授易於接近學生，辦行政則無形中與同學同事疏遠，精神上至感苦痛。</p>
<p>武大遠從川西復員，未獲政府給予任何交通工具上之便利，而復員工作之迅速確實，周氏認此實屬校內外師生團結努力所致。復負以後，除恢復原有農學院外，幷加文醫學院，尤以院舍及醫院之建築，爲最可慰之成績，否則當時十數億元之建築費，今日勢棄百億莫辦。</p>
<p>對於武大發生這六一慘案，周氏認爲純屬政治問題，惟鵝用政治方法方可獲致合理解決，武大作風向主獨立與寬大，只要無破壞政府之行動，則師生之安全與自由，學校絕對負賣。本期旣未任意開除學生，從不藉端解聘教授。武大年來對學術工作漸有建樹，文哲社會科學理科及工程四大季刊，即將全部恢復。文理法工四研究所亦擬大規模擴充設備，增加圖書，使成爲華中方而硏究學術之中心。</p>
<p>周氏對於胡適之教育獨立計劇，原則上表未贊同，惟五校或十校，則屬另一問題。周氏末對敎育經費認爲如不設法充實，難期有良好成就，如更能配以全面安定之環境，則學術水準之提高不難迎頭趕上。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕武大上海校友會，定於十一月二日午後二時，假南京路南國酒家舉行慶祝母校校慶大會，本擬邀請周校長出席主持，聞周氏表示今日在滬晤見王部長世杰後，當即返京飛漢，親自主持武大三十五週年校慶盛典。</p>

<h3>常勝軍傑志隊一球勝香港會　星島二比一倖勝聖約瑟</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕一個星期　，四天有球賽，這是今年香港足球賽的特殊鏡頭，因此週三週四又見處處炸煙，相當熱鬧。</p>
<p>迪雲又敗</p>
<p>週三〔廿二日)，三塲戰事。　掃桿埔塲，兩枝陸軍動旅火拼，態尼斯門迪雲，結果無隊火出人意，竟以四對二勇挫迪雲。於是洋兵最强的隊伍在聯賽也失去四分，奪標形勢，盡居下風。　警察塲，中　戰　察，論實力，無可比較，但警察隊素以「煙」稱於時，踢來充滿打鬥氣味，中華但求勝便東了，結果　二比一。</p>
<p>傑志捷報</p>
<p>銅　畔，是今年長勝軍傑志出戰，對手是香港會，香港會踢得好，造成傑志前半時僅勝三對一，下半塲却負二比三的局面，總結果五對四，傑志僅勝一球，</p>
<p>戰情的發展，兩　　情表演，所進之球，均淸　玲瓏，兆榮先開紀錄，香港會右翼早拉却用頭撞入扳成平手，此後兆榮挑入，英祺單刀都告得手，上半塲成三比一。再戰，香港會花留射入十二碼，成三比二，英祺和香港會中鋒烈文各搶兩球完塲，傑志陣容：</p>
<p>朱兆恒　曾仲雲　侯榕生　譚振輝　宋靈聖　劉松生　黃景聽　黎兆榮　郭英祺　何慶芬　鄧廣森</p>
<p>星島初勝</p>
<p>週四(廿三日)，一樣是三塲對壘，星島自以二比七慘敗於傑志後，今日戰聖約瑟，本該有較好演出，但踢來仍然是一盤散沙，勝球二比一，實在是從倖遝巾得來。</p>
<p>從陣脚來說，星島動員八名遠遊大將，聖隊也得小告山奴壓陣，並向澳門借來加華路，陳利西維亞等好手，於是踢得起勁了。</p>
<p>戰程全在搏殺巾過渡，前半時，形勢屬於聖隊，下半塲自加華路傷後，星島始能轉提優勢。前半時各得十二碼球，但加華路事入，景祥却請客，於是星烏先負了。下半塲，加華路受傷，里島全師湧進，李殿祺射空門，打成和局。此後，聖隊雖被圍攻，門將　當高演得好，也使星島奈何不得，看看，時間終了，秋事偸得一個越位機會，將球撥入，就此氣走聖隊。兩陣對列如下：</p>
<p>星島</p>
<p>余耀德　莫節松　劃天申　許竟成　單友生　馮坤勝　曹秋亭　霹樹萍　張金海　馮景祥　李嚴祺</p>
<p>另外二塲</p>
<p>另兩報，勝負是必然的，巴士大勝光華六比零，光華敗是活該，輸得慘却因爲陣容變動太大，塲塲不同，人脚如何踢得好。東方羸海軍，是四比二。</p>

<h3>明日的飛機</h3>
<p>— 孟琨</p>
<p>飛機進步的迅速，比其他的發明都快得多。從初懂得烏翼的構成與翱翔的原理到今日大概有近五百年的歷史，可是美國萊特(Wright)兄弟造成第一架飛行器的日期却是一九○三年了，離現在不過四十四年。道四十四年中，一切的枓學成功，如印刷術，火藥，防癆劑，槍砲，輪船，摩天厦，以及原子理論等雖也有驚人的猛晋，但總不及飛機的進步快，尤其是經過這一次大戰。</p>
<p>四十四年前的第一架飛機只在空中駛行了十二秒鐘，距離是一百餘呎，四十四年後的今天，不久前奧頓乘的「雷諾彈壳」號祗以七十四小時的時問環地球一週。在這四十四年的短短時期裏，飛機的發展委實是太快了。它發展的里碑可從下述一迎串的事實來證明：一九○五年萊特兄弟造成四十公里的飛行記錄；一九一一年義大利攻擊的黎波里時有第一架飛機助戰；一九二七年林白(C．A．　Lindbergh）獨駕一機自　約逕抵巴黎；一九三三年波斯特(Post)駕機繞地球一週；一九三五年蘇聯高爾基號飛機出現，乘客百餘人。再以後便是飛行技術的突進時期，也就是第二次世界大戰的爆發，這一段慘酷的過程裏，飛機的速度超過了音速，載重滿二十噸，高度逾一萬公尺，產量在不到五分鐘裏平均可有一架完成。</p>
<p>當然，這一進展是還在持續着，並且更快地發展着的，因此明日的飛機與昨日的和今日的自亦不同了。這一不同，不祗是數　上的或數字上的，更多是屬於性能和質地方面，此後將展開了飛機的新世紀是毫無疑問的事。根據最近一些報章雜誌的報導，關於明日飛機的進步路綫大致循着以下的一些方向。</p>
<p>形式方面。以往的飛機只有單　或雙寰之分，大戰中的最新型飛機在逐漸模彷雪茄烟；爲了速度和防止物體所受的空氣阻力，明日的飛機將是以一種砲彈的形狀出現，似乎沒有尾巴，而　子也眞的跟烏翼一般，更短而圓。此外形式上的變更是過分地大或特殊地小。當然，形式的改良雖是最憲著的改良，却不是最主要的改良，並且形式的改良是附屬於性能的改良方面。</p>
<p>性能方面。有人以爲飛機的性能已盡善盡美了，可是事實上和理論上證明飛機灣有好多可供　展的餘地。速度在大戰終了時最高紀錄是每小時近八百公里，這二年已喧傳有一千公里的飛機出現；這種飛機的速度已超着音速而接近地球的自轉速了，假如有繼續不斷的原子能供應，那麼二十四小時可繞地球一週，永遠費行在太陽光的籠照裏。關於容　，美國最大的旅行機已不啻一艘小輪船，能有餐廳，舞塲，電影院，圖書館，和游泳池，便是移作軍事用的最新「波音」三十六式，亦能載重近五十噸，同時據說「波音」四十二式也在產生。最高方面大概可達一萬三千公尺，已在平流層裏了。續航力祇少可達一萬公里。這樣，飛機便代替了一切的飛行器，氣球氣船飛　等都被淘汰了。此外，飛機的直昇和直降的理恕也在逐漸完成，可能不須要什麽廣闊的飛行塲，但目前還只適用於袖珍型的小飛機，供人民玩玩的，已能在馬路上降落或起飛了，有的就能泊在屋頂。</p>
<p>駕駛方面。以前用各種引　摧動的飛機，很可能以原子能發動器來代替，原子能的飛機，據說在美國和蘇聯都有相彷的設計告成，用原子核的潛能來供輸力源，在這一新的成功下，飛機的速皮及續航力等都可大加改良，並且飛機還能輕得多。原子能外，以火箭原理(Rocket)應用於飛機的裝置，更因爲飛彈（V1)的成功而可日實現；不過要達到將飛機射往月球去，使飛機能脫離空氣而在眞空要挺進，怕還不是馬上能實現的事。動力的改良以外，無綫電的駕駛工程亦在日漸完備，最近已有一架這類的飛機渡過了大西洋，實在是飛機史上値得欣慰的一大紀念，這制度的確立，應用於遠距離或高空的飛行，可以使不致於會有困倦犧犧牲遭遇到一飛行人員的命運上。</p>
<p>效用方面。飛機的效用本不限於戰爭，但爲了服務於戰爭，飛機在平時的服務能力也擴大了。現在的飛機可以運輸，作爲醫院，測量土地，地面，星辰，和氣候，不祗是載送旅客及郵件。並且即以載送旅客言，不日無聲飛機的出現，也將使得旅客們的舒適程度大增。此外，明日的飛行駕駛技術將格外簡單，跟開一輛汽車相近，任何人只需要短暫期問的學習和練習。飛機大衆化，與一班民衆都有緣。</p>
<p>除了這些，如飛機的將採用塑膠做材料，使飛機輕堅美觀，如飛機製迭技術的改良，將使飛機能大量地增產，都是明日必有的進步。一般的預計，等待到飛機發明五十週年時，飛機的各方面都一定較今日更改善幾倍。飛機的進步，是人類智慧工程的一部分。</p>
<h3>物理學年會追記</h3>
<p>— 陳嶽生</p>
<p>今年的十月十日，雖然看不見什麼特別熟鬧的跡象，聽不見什麼特別愉快的歡聲，但是上海却有中國物理學會年會的盛舉，點綴了我們勝利後第三度的國慶佳節。京滬杭區的會員，都帶着興奮的精神，輕鬆的情緒，跑到岳陽路中央研究院去，參加這一個很有意義的學人大集會，同時又懷着一顆欣遇舊雨新知之心，要借此與久不相晤或不易常晤或久欲識荊的同道，彼此一吐積愫</p>
<p>中央大學校長吳有訓，是年會的演講人，老早就到了會塲。吳氏衣裳樸素，容貌淸　，祇覺得他是一個士而不是一個大夫。老前　曹惠羣未到，聽說是有病。曹氏接連十一天在交通大學與裘維裕，周昌壽等審查物理學新名詞，每天深晚始歸，又沒有汽車送他回家，老年人經不起過分勞苦，以致感冒而失去了三日六餐佳　，不禁爲之叫屈。地磁專家陳宗器手巾常提大皮包一個，未知內藏甚麼寳貝。海生堡的弟子我國量子力學專家王福山，大智若愚地靜候開會。人類學家劉咸，神經學家盧子道，亦以來實資格到會參加。</p>
<p>大會主席藏本棟致開會辭時，曾說公分吳厘米決不可並存，億字決不可用以稱萬萬。他的話，使笨者想起了數墨與算學的爭辯，想起了玄學與科學的論戰，更想起了國內其他的雙包案。天下定於「一」，要做到這個「一」字，實在很難很難。化學專家吳學周以敎育部代表的身份出現於台上。他從東西思想發展史的比較，預卜我國物理學乃至全部科學，總該有發揚光大之一日。致力我國提倡科學事業二十餘年的任鴻雋，以科學社代表的資格登台發言，以爲亟宜修補我國物理學硏究機關的創傷。但願這創傷趕快修補起來，傳可早日恢復健康而向前邁進，不要弄到舊創未復新創又加纔好，</p>
<p>吳有訊的演講差不多全用偏鋒，而且聲調忽揚忽抑，詞語亦諧亦莊，確使筆者心折。他以爲物理學的「進展」與「普及」宜同時並進；他要我們「互相欣賞，互相激勵」；他提出了「嚴格」與「不騙人」的口號。學術的研究當然不應該「騙人」，而且也「騙不了人一，周某某獲得諾貝爾獎金的謠言，究竟是中國人的一件不體面的事情。其實在「普及」一方面，也應該「不騙人」而有創作的精神。假定有一本中國的通俗科學雜誌偏要印個英文名字Scientirhc　China在封面，而內容多半不是中國的東西，這似乎跡近於騙人而有掠美之嫌。假定另有一本中國的通俗科學雜誌，差不多全部轉載國外書報上的作品，那些作品的所有人寫信給中國的編者，用很婉轉的語氣要求抽轉載的版稅，那位編輯居然會牛頭不對馬嘴的來一　譯文，與原信一同刋出，說是希望他代出中文版，這簡直比騙人更不如了。萬一這「騙人」的習氣給人舉做了去，將來怎能堅守「不騙人」的　言呢？吳氏還講了一則很有趣味很有弦外之音的故事，說是二十餘年前郎謬爾初來我國，目中無人，後來得見我國居然也有X射錢設備，居然更有韋爾生霧室，方始由倨而恭。這一段故事使筆者想起了劉咸在七科學團體座談會席上，所說等待我國有了原子能研究後再向世界發表對於原子能的意見那一節話。</p>
<p>宣讀論文時，丁緒實表演示教儀器數種，態度滑稽，傳得笑聲不少。論文中重要的有陸學善「氧化鈾品體初步報告」，施汝爲「脅强對矯頑力之影響」，陳宗器「中國東南部地磁」　篇，都是在國內精心硏究而得的結果。尚有束星北「力—虛構之概念」一篇，因本人未來，托人代讀，不免有美中不足之嫌。陸氏的硏究，據謂美國曼哈坦計劃中亦有，但尚在守秘之中。</p>
<p>空軍表演雷達，得預先參覜之優待。數十里外飛機經過，屏上綠色熒光綫則起波動。白色熒光綫上即現一點，方向距離，立刻可知。全機大小，不過像一隻書橱，然而其中的學理按巧，豈是一橱之嘗可盡，又豈是一朝一夕可致。</p>
<p>開座談會時，有人說上海某某中學。所用教木都是大學物理，似嫌太深。有人說某大學招考新生的試題，不知是考中學生的抑是考大學生的。這些話，博得全塲鼓掌。丁緒寶又出新奇玩意，表演一番。好像聽見有人說，沒有什麽希奇，筆者大不以爲然。丁氏的創作精神，與夫意在教化的婆心苦口，豈可不予以欽佩。須知發明原子彈發明相對論固是了不得的事情，而使愚昧的大衆了解物理學的基本知識，恐怕也不是一件容易的工作罷。</p>

<h3>冷光</h3>
<p>— 靑茵</p>
<p>物理學告訴我們，當一個物體熱到某種程度時，便會發光。光與熱總是連帶在一起的。天空中，太陽是最平常的發熱發光物體，晚上的星辰，許多是比太陽更熱更壳，但是因爲距離地球太遠了，所以我們僅能覺察到微光與測到極微的熟量。因此之故，當我們遇到光時，總會聯想到熱的存在，這兩者簡直似一對親兄弟一樣難分難捨。</p>
<p>但是，提到所謂一冷光」，却不能不使這一對親兄弟分開了，原來，一冷「光是與「熟」不相干的。</p>
<p>冷光雖然不是由熟而成的，但它的作用却仍與普通由熟生成的光相同，能使各種物質發生鄰光與螢光，能使照相底片感光，植物幼苗能向着它的方向彎曲，也能使葉子發生葉綠素。</p>
<p>這種冷光的來源，差不多都在生物身上，晒乾的乾魚，死獸肉上，往往在夜問能够發光，這是由一種細菌所致，這類細菌有三十種，最普通的叫Bacteerium</p>
<p>Phosphreum日，生於魚肉上，發光是它活動的副作用。海洋附近也往往可以看到死了的魚，在腐壞初期的夜間，發出草綠色的光輝這也是由於這種細菌所致。</p>
<p>在幽邃的石　中，也每每有發光的苔，這種苔的原因，是由於它表皮上一種透鏡狀的細胞反射日光所致，貓眼能在暗處發光，也不過是由於它眼的背面有一種極發達的鏡狀層反射光綫之故。</p>
<p>發光動物中最多的是海中的魚蝦之類，它們發光的部份很多，多在腹部附近，如海筆，星魚，脆魚等都是，有一種叫光焰余的，它的光竟可以藉之閱讀書報。有些海里常含有無數的夜光蟲，那是單細胞的小動物，受刺激時即能發光，所以往往當海船駛過或人們走過剛退潮的沙灘上，便留下一道金色的光痕。</p>
<p>其他動物能發光的很多：在南美有一種土名汽車蟲的，前部發白光，後部發紅光；在紐西蘭有一個大地負，牆上頂上滿是成千成萬的火螢，熙耀得整個地窟通明；在蘇門答臘有種火螢，有二十八個光點，因其發光而著名。此外，還有無數種的水母，海綿，海蟲，蚯蚓，蛇尾類棘皮動物，軟體動物，蝦，蟹，烏賊以及槍鯛等也都能發光。</p>
<h3>突變是化學性的改變嗎？（續）</h3>
<p>— 郝天和</p>
<p>在另一方面，芥子氣的改糾效率，右時並不低於X光錢，司里欽斯基及司里欽斯克(Slizynska)二人川各種方法，作細胞學的研究，去產生性運致死因基，曾經發見百分之二十的實例中，祗產生一個致死因基。這種的潰傳改變，是由於染色體上負有微細的缺陷所致。而且產生這種因基的出現率無論是經過X光綫或紫外光綫的輔射，或是經過芥子氣的處理都是相同的。雖則有的是因基眞的發生突變了。有的是染色體發動了輕微的改組。潰傳學家都着重在這相同的一點上，就是爲什麼發生相同的出現率，而毫無參差，也許是由於因基突變和染色體改組，沒有顯著的差別，因爲那種改組極爲輕微的。不能用細胞學的方法去檢視出來的。至於染色體上的小小缺陷是否就是造成致死因基相同的比例，這是値得注意的。那種致死因基有時也能川比芥子氣力量小的化學藥品去產生的。</p>
<p>在X光綫和芥子氣的理化作用之問還有弟二種的異點，化學藥品處理以後，發見一種可用目見的突變，這個硏究有一點是失敗了。因爲在研究過程中所，觀察到的突變，和用X光綫輻射之後，所得的那種突變，都是同一類的。而且這種氣體對於因基的個體並沒有顯出任何特別的影響。所以芥子氣和X光綫的輻射作用似乎沒有什麼分別。然而這兩種力量之間，確有一種不同之處，不在乎所產生的突變的種類，而在於被處理過的果蠅的子代裏的突變所顯出不同的趨向，雄果蠅經過X光綫處理之後，在多數突發的子代中發生了變態，如同黃的體色，代替了正常的灰白色。籠罩着他們身體整個的表面，祗有一小部分(少於百分之十五)的突變個體是屬於鑲嵌式的，就是身體一部分的色澤，顯出變態，其他部分還是正常的。相反的，雄果蠅經過芥子氣處理以後，所有突變的子孫，鑲嵌式占有較高的比例數(普通介於百分之三十到五十之間)而且那種因X光綫所引起的鑲嵌式的果蠅的生殖腺裏，極少含有正常的和突變的兩種細胞，而且那種因芥子氣所引起的鑲嵌式果蠅倒很通常的產生這兩種細胞。關於這種鑲嵌式生殖腺的特別硏究已經做過，專門注重在性迎致死因基的突變。一個雌果蠅(從被處理過的雄果蠅所產生的的卵巢如有一部分組織所含的細胞裘，帶有一個性連致死因基，將來所產生的男兒，往往比正常的雌果蠅爲少，男兒缺少的程度，須視卵巢裏的正常部分與特變部分大小的比例而定。要是一個雌果蠅有一種性述半死的突變因基，(Sex－linked“Semilethal”　Matations)很平均的分佈在卵巢所有的細胞襄，此種突變，勢必减少男兒的產生。因此雄性的子代中，祗有一部分能够完全發育，因此她所產的子孫裏的兩性比率，也會同樣的减低。推究原因，這種雌果蠅是遭受錯誤輔射的雄果蠅的女兒，她們所產生的子孫中，兩性比率較低，這種變態幾乎全是由於半死的突變因基影響到整個的卵巢而發生的。在另一方面，雄果蠅如用芥子氣處理以後，所產生的女兒，每二十個中，有九個將來會缺少男兒的。這是因爲在她們不正常的卵巢裏，有一部分鑲嵌式的細胞，帶有一種性連致死因基。最後還要提到一種很顯著的鑲嵌式的實例，一個受過芥子氣處理的雄果蠅所生的男兒，無論在她們的生殖腺，或身體細胞裏，都是種鑲嵌式的細胞。假定在精細胞裏的因基受了處理的影響之後，雖不立刻起突變，但是可以得到一種突變的傾向，而且道種傾向，可以潛伏起來。直到以後細胞分裂的時候，這個假定也得到了事實的支持。因爲在幾個實例中，曾經發見那種具有鑲嵌式的生殖腺的果蠅所產生的子孫。還是具有同樣鑲嵌式的生殖腺，在道種例子裏，可以見到一種由外力所引起的某種不穩定的突變性質，在變成穩定以後，好像也能够從這一代，傳到下一代，在輔射遺傳方面，還沒有同樣平行的觀察報告。但是這種所謂不穩定的因基，似乎値得注意，這種因基在未經處理的材料中，曾經發見過幾次，都有向同一方向繼續突變的傾向。</p>

<h3>論悲劇主角</h3>
<p>— 陳瘦竹</p>
<p>關於悲劇中的主角，亞里士多德在「詩學」第十三章中，會有詳細說明。道是亞里士多德戲劇理論中最重要的問題之一，茲先譯其原文如次。</p>
<p>「凡完美之悲劇，必須安排複雜之結構，不應安排簡單之結構，此義前文業已說明。再者，悲劇應表現足以激發憐憫與恐怖之動作，蓋悲劇表現之特色，即在於此。據此推論，則第一點，悲劇中所寫命述之轉變，不應表現善人自幸運陷入厄運之景象；蓋此旣不令人憐憫亦不令人恐怖，僅使吾人驚愕而已。第二點，不應表現惡人自厄運轉爲幸運，蓋此最不合於悲劇精神，其中毫無悲劇性質，旣不足以滿足道德意識，亦不足以激發憐憫或恐怖。第三，極惡之人終得惡果，亦不宜入劇。此種結構固可滿足道德意識，但亦不足引起憐憫與恐怖；蓋無辜受難，乃能喚起吾人之憐憫，而唯類似吾人之人遭遇不幸，始能喚起吾人之恐怖。是故惡人而得惡報，旣不可憐亦不可怖。由此言之，最宜於悲劇之人物，厥為處此兩種極端之間—其人並非極端善良正直，而其遭受不幸，非由邪德敗行，係由某種錯誤或缺點所致。故其人必須名高望軍，聲勢煊赫，例如　狄浦斯密斯特斯或其他顯族中人」</p>
<p>亞里士多德之意，認爲悲劇主角，必須介乎全善全惡之間，具有人所難免的錯誤或缺點，然後方能獲得悲劇效果。悲劇是一種衝突，是一種苦難；假如一個十全十完的人，幾乎不可能有衝突，即使因衝突而受苦難，亦必不動聲色，泰然自若，彷彿未曾受苦難一般。神仙不會遭難，聖賢反以受苦爲樂；因此，我們不相信神仙眞會產生悲劇，而聖賢的悲劇亦超乎我們的同情。我們雖然羡慕神仙，崇拜聖賢，但是我們到底不是神仙聖賢，他們超乎我們之上，我們並不眞愛他們，亦不眞恨他們，所以對於他們，並無最深刻的同情。我們同情於像我們一樣的人，有人性，近人情，我們眞愛他們，眞恨他們，所以發生最濃厚的興趣。因此，唯有他們的悲劇，才能使我們感動。</p>
<p>悲劇旣以不圓滿的結局爲正宗，則無論善人得善報或惡人得善報，自然均不足以成悲劇。至於惡人得惡報，雖合於「詩的公道」，但亦不足以產生悲劇的結果。無論悲劇在於使人得到發洩或是感動，然而決非勸人爲善，培養道德觀念；而惡人之得惡報，除令人拍手稱快而外，別無意義可言。</p>
<p>德國劇作家席勒（Schiller)，據傳並未讀過「詩學」，但是關於悲劇主角的看法，部與亞里士多德所見相同。席勒在其「論悲劇藝術」（Ueber　die　Tiagische　Kunst）一文中，曾說：「悲劇舉仿動作，而此動作讓我們看到一個人在受難。人這一個字，量足以標明悲劇的範圍。唯有像我們一樣的人受難時，扌匪引起我們的憐憫心。因此，惡鬼邪神，或甚至像他們一樣毫無道德的人，以及毫無缺點精靈，都不適宜於悲劇。所謂受難，意指十足的一個人的受難而言。精靈決無受難之理，近乎精靈的人亦引不起我們深厚的同情心。一個邪惡的人固然要遭過到可怕的苦難；但是人若毫無道德意識，祗是苦難的傀儡而已，凡是受苦而不關乎理性那種景象適足令人厭惡而已。故悲劇家情願描寫複合的性格，而使理想的悲劇主角介乎全惡全善之間，實在極有見地。」</p>
<p>在希臘悲劇中，我們可以攀出三個悲劇來硏究亞里士多德的理論。悲劇主角的厄運，係由於不知而犯或明知故犯的錯誤，或莫須有的錯誤所造成。「窩狄浦斯王」的悲劇成因，由於窩狄浦斯王的殺父娶母。然而此種錯誤，係受命運播弄，主角未能未卜先知，故而演成悲劇。此種悲劇，純爲希臘宗教的產物，如按近代觀念，則凡無意中鎊成大錯，自身並不能負責。故在近代悲劇中，此例已不多見。「美狄亞」一劇，足爲明知故犯的錯誤之佳例。美狄亞蓄意報復，審思熟慮逐步實現她的毒計，她明知將要產生何種結果，雖則心中不無矛盾，然其毒計終於實現。關於「安蒂高妮」一劇，黑格爾雖認爲主角失之太偏，然吾人細加思索，誰能承認她眞有錯誤？她爲友愛而遠犯國法，誰說她不應該？所以安蒂高妮遭遇厄遝，自身亦不能負責。</p>
<p>這第三個例，即主角無辜受難，顯與亞里士多德所謂悲劇主角必須具有人所難免的錯誤或弱點之說相反。而近代社會悲劇，大都屬於此例。在近代不合理的社會制度之下，一般善良的人，本身可說毫無缺陷，平白遭受各種不合理的壓迫以及傷害，而至於滅亡。蓋越劇旨在表現人生，人類生活時在變化之中故凡悲劇　喜劇的基本精神，古今亦復興　。</p>
<p>關於悲劇主角的身份或地位，亞里士多德認爲「必須位高名重，　勢煊赫」。此種見解，僅足以解釋古代悲劇；按諸近代悲劇，未必盡然。在歐洲神權時代及　權時代，神祇帝王以及英雄美人，在一般人的心目中佔有重要地位，故不僅希臘悲劇，即如莎士比亞悲劇，其中主角，無不名高位重，聲勢煊赫。但自十八世紀民主政治盛行，家庭悲劇勃興之後，中產附級甚至無產階級已在悲劇中取得合法地位。近代觀衆到劇塲去，愛看他們自己的生活表現在舞台上，對於古代劇中的神祗帝王以及英雄美人，已不如古代觀衆那樣感到興趣。一般普通人的愛和恨，物質生活甚至心靈生活方面的苦悶，正是近代劇中的絕好題材。因此，我們對於悲劇主角的要求，並不在其身份或地位的尊卑高下，而是在其高貴的性格以及堅强的毅力。</p>
<p>關於人物性格，「詩學」第十五章中，另有一種規定：</p>
<p>「關於性格，所應注意者有四事。第一，性格必須善良，此點最爲重要。凡顯示任何道德目的之語言或動作，無不足以表現其人物之性格；倘此道德目的善良者，其性格亦必善良。此項規則，對於每一類人，均適用之。蓋婦女雖劣於男子，奴隸雖卑不足道，然婦女或奴隸，亦不無善良之處。第二，描寫性格，力求得體。剛毅勇敢，乃大丈夫之氣概，如謂婦女剛勇，或靈巧而無所　　，則不相宜。第三，性格必須力求眞實，合於人生謂之眞實，不可與善良得體混爲一談。第四，描寫性格，必須力求前後一致；蓋所表現之某種人物之性格雖不一致，然於其不一致之中，必有一致者在。」</p>
<p>亞里士多德此處所謂善良，係指品性而言，並非完美無缺之意，籃一位十全美的完人不適宜於悲劇，已如上述。然而人物性格是否必須善良，我們近代人的看法，則與亞里土多德不無出入之處。攸里匹德斯爲寫實計，將悲劇中頗多卑劣的人物，如「美狄亞」中的伊阿宋（Gason），「奧雷斯特」（Orestes)中的美納洛（Menelaus）等。英國依利薩伯時代悲劇中，尤多　漢角色。由此可見，悲劇中的人物，並非必須善良。我們所要朮於劇中人物者，並非在其性格是否善良，而是在於確實具有一種特殊性格，明顯而且深刻。</p>
<p>關於描寫性格必須力求得體一點，我們所見，亦與亞里士多徳未盡相同。所謂得體(Propriety)，意指合於類型或合於通性（True　to　Type)。古代作家，每將人物分爲若干類型，而深究其共同特性，以相區別。每一類人的通性各不相同，故描寫某一類人的性格，必須介乎某一類人的通性。希臘悲劇取材神話傳說，其中人物均有定型，故悲劇詩人必須力求合乎類型性格，而後方能取信於人。希臘哲人蕭夫拉斯托斯（Theophrastus）曾作「人物素描」（Characters）三十六篇，將三十六類人物的通性，寫得生動加畫。他對於當時作家影響甚大，歐洲世態喜劇（Comedy　of　Manners）之　希臘喜劇火師梅南德（Menander)深得力於他。我們從僅存的梅南德的殘稿以及模倣他的特倫斯（Terence）與普勞托斯（Plautus）的喜劇中，隨時遇到昏庸老朽的父親，荒唐熱　的兒子，以及智足多謀的僕人。這些人物，都是類型人物，具有明顯的通性，缺乏特殊的個性。描寫人物通性，雖然便於識別，但其最火缺點，人物性格大抵千篇一律，類型人物竟成俗套人物（Stock　Character），每使讀者觀衆望而生厭。蓋人類生活日趨繁複，社會環境對於人類的影響亦日漸强烈，而人性的硏究亦更精細深刻。故在近代戲劇中，不僅性格重於情節，而關於性格的描寫，個性重於通性。亞里士多德雖然主持人物性格必須合乎類型，但以合乎類型四字批評近代戲劇，其意貶多於褒。假如我們墨守亞里士多德的理論，堅持類型性格，則我們將要像英國新古典主義泰斗賴麥（ThomasRymer）一樣的錯誤。賴麥認爲「興賽羅」中亞高這個人物不能成立。何故？因爲在賴麥看來，軍人誠實，以德報德，乃爲世所公認之事。藝術家之可貴，在於隨處獨出心裁，發人之所未發，切忌人云亦云。現代愛爾蘭文豪夏芝（Yeats）在其「劇本與論爭」（Plays　and　Controversties）中曾說：「凡屬藝術，無不基於個人的幻想，藝術愈偉大，幻想愈是個人的；一切拙劣藝術，基於非個人的類型與形象，普通一般男女，因爲缺乏想像，不敢神游幻境，或因只知苦工而無奇才，所以接受那種非個人的類型與形象。」所謂非個人的是指概括，個人的是指獨創。科學的精神在於概括，藝術的精神在於獨創。</p>
<p>近代人的見解雖與亞里士多德稍有出入，但此並不足以减低亞里士多德的價値。誠如英國　萊登所說：「如謂亞里士多德會作如是說，未足以爲定論，蓋亞里士多德所依據者，僅爲索福克勒斯與攸里匹德斯之悲劇而已；倘彼生於今日，得見今人作品，彼或將改變其論調。」文學藝術轉人類生活而進化，古今各殊，假如我們墨守他的理論，而不加補充發明，適足違反他的批評精神。</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Discusses the Peace Treaty with Japan, Reaffirms China's Stance, Control Issues Discussed with MacArthur</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th) Before his departure on the afternoon of the 26th, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie told Allied reporters that China still expects the United States and the Soviet Union to respond to the "compromise plan" regarding the peace treaty with Japan. He stated that according to his "compromise plan," China would insist on retaining the veto power of the four major powers. China fought Japan for the longest time and suffered the most. It hopes that peace will have some guarantee. He does not believe that any of the four major powers will abuse the veto power in the peace conference with Japan. China has also tried to limit the veto power in the United Nations. Wang denied that his compromise plan would delay the convening date of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference. He stated that the compromise suggestion is intended to ensure that all countries participating in the Far East war are able to participate, and to make the future "peace treaty a true and lasting peace treaty." The United States' proposal to completely abolish the veto power and the Soviet Union's proposal that the foreign ministers of the four powers draft the peace treaty are both unacceptable to China. His compromise plan advocates for a majority vote of the eleven countries, which must include the four major powers. Wang, as the chief representative of China at the United Nations, discussed the difficulties of the United Nations, saying that unless the two major peace treaties with Germany and Japan are concluded, the tension within the United Nations cannot be reduced, nor can the member states be expected to restore their spirit of cooperation. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, he stated that China's policy is generally no different from that of the United States or other allied countries in basic aspects. We all believe that Japan should be economically self-sufficient. We all believe that non-military factories, and other industries that can be converted to military use, should be dismantled or strictly restricted. Furthermore, any differences of opinion regarding Japanese reparations can be resolved after thorough discussion at the peace conference. Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese trade, Wang stated that China is currently unable to export or import large quantities, which is a major difficulty in promoting international trade. In addition, since the last war, China's international trade has been mostly handled by government agencies. The late arrival of Chinese trade representatives in Japan is not purely due to opposition from the general public to the restoration of trade relations between the two countries. Wang does not believe that the issue of Japanese immigration to China is economically serious. He pointed out that the number of Japanese immigrants to Northeast China is extremely small, which proves that the Japanese are unwilling to move far from their islands. The Chinese government does not intend to formulate immigration laws solely for economic reasons. Wang did not comment on how Japan would be controlled and supervised after the signing of the peace treaty, or for how long. However, he said that he had discussed this issue with MacArthur for an hour.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Leaves Japan Today, Passes Through Shanghai in the Afternoon and Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing, 26th dispatch] External news: Foreign Minister Wang can fly from Tokyo to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th and is scheduled to return to Beijing by special plane at approximately 2 p.m. that afternoon.</p>
<h3>Prosperity of Sino-Japanese Trade Awaits the Completion of Two Conditions, Japanese Reporters Praise Foreign Minister Wang's "Enlightenment"</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie took a car to Hakone, a famous scenic spot 60 miles southwest of Tokyo, on the morning of the 26th. Accompanying him were General Shang Zhen, Shen Jinding, and others. Wang held a press conference at the official residence of the Chinese mission here in the afternoon. Wang declined to comment on the DeMeyer mission report currently in the State Department's files, as he had not yet learned of its contents. At the same time, he remained silent about an article written by Bullitt advocating for a $1.3 billion loan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie said at a reception for Japanese reporters on the evening of the 26th that Sino-Japanese trade can only prosper after Japan has been thoroughly democratized and China's production capacity has increased. After these two conditions are met, trade between the two countries will be the largest. Regarding the peace treaty and the international situation, Wang had already elaborated on his views at the reception for Allied reporters. At the reception for Japanese reporters, he reiterated his views, but also specifically stated that China still doubts whether Japan has truly gotten rid of the past warlords and aggressors in the short period after its surrender. However, whether China's doubts are correct is another question. Wang explained that after Japan's surrender, all demobilized officers and soldiers, regardless of the atrocities they committed during the long period of suffering in China, have safely returned home. China has no intention of retaliating for Japan's past actions, but is extremely concerned about Japan's future potential. China is concerned about whether Japan's militarism and aggressive nationalism have been eliminated, and the future relationship between the two countries will depend on this. Japanese reporters said that Wang's views explained some issues that the Japanese people had not previously understood. The reporters also praised Wang's "enlightening" meeting, believing that Wang's remarks could encourage the Japanese to strive for self-improvement, move towards democracy, and warn the Japanese that there is still much work to be done.</p>
<h3>Japanese Industrial Equipment to be Used for Reparations to China, Removal to Begin at the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The scientific group of our mission in Japan told reporters today that the transfer of industrial equipment from Japan as reparations to China will begin at the end of November. The person in charge of the group said that although the initial batch of reparations to China amounts to 9,700 pieces of machinery, it is impossible to ship them all back to China by the end of November. He pointed out that some machinery may be traded with the other three countries that received reparations, or rejected. It was also learned from Japan that large-scale dismantling work on the industrial equipment for reparations will begin at the beginning of next month. 1,400 machine tool mother machines from the former Japanese Navy Technical Factory in Yokohama will be dismantled and packaged, ready for shipment to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. These are the first machine tool mother machines to be dismantled from the seventeen factories designated for reparations.</p>
<h3>British Delegation in Taiwan, Visiting Factories in Groups</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Taipei, 26th dispatch] Lord Ammon of the British delegation held a reception for reporters at 9:30 a.m. on the 26th, praising the beauty of Taiwan Island. He said: Although the Chinese are thrifty, they are still richer than the British. The British are overcoming difficulties and rebuilding Europe with a spirit of hard work. They have never voluntarily issued any documents on inland navigation and must wait for the Sino-British trade agreement negotiations. Regarding China's internal strife, the members of parliament have different views due to different parties. It is reported that the British are quite interested in setting up businesses in Taiwan. They are now visiting factories in three groups and will hold a reception for all sectors of society at a dinner party in Tamsui in the evening.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th dispatch] It is reported that the British Parliamentary Delegation will fly to Guangzhou on the 3rd of next month. The provincial and municipal agencies have prepared to welcome them. It is heard that the delegation will stay in Guangzhou for three days.</p>
<h3>President Zhang Inspects Keelung, Visits National Taiwan University, Departs for Kaohsiung and then Pingtung Today Before Returning to Beijing</h3>

<h3>Japanese Postal Workers' Group Work Stoppage Expands</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Since the Japanese Ministry of Communications personnel's group work stoppage began on the 20th, the number of package workers signing in for office has been reduced to about 40%. Although the process is ostensibly not based on the instructions of the labor union, but as an automatic act of the workers, the daily work stoppage has expanded further. Those in office are now no more than 20% to 30%. On the 20th, 2,000 packages were not sent out of the Tokyo Central Post Office, and the number has continued to increase daily. Therefore, on the 25th, the Ministry of Communications announced that it would not accept large postal items such as packages, newspapers, and magazines to many areas.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Katayama Explains the New Criminal Law, Abolishes the Crime of Disrespecting the Emperor</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The revised new criminal law of Japan will be promulgated today. Prime Minister Katayama met with reporters on the 25th and made a statement on this, saying, "The main points of this revision are as follows: Abolish special crimes against foreign heads of state and envoys; Abolish the crime of disrespecting the Emperor; Strengthen the protection of speech and publication; Abolish the crime of adultery. However, foreign heads of state and envoys are still respected, and disrespectful behavior is fully suppressed under general laws. The abolition of the crime of disrespecting the Emperor is based on the democratic nature of the Japanese Constitution and abolishes special crimes. As for protecting speech and publication, this does not mean that bad publications are permitted. The abolition of the crime of adultery does not mean that it is recognized as legal. Adultery is morally improper, so it is recognized as a reason for divorce under civil law.</p>
<h3>List of Candidates for National Assembly from the Three Parties; Can be Submitted to the Election Headquarters by Month's End; Changes to the Overseas Chinese Election Method Resolved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the candidates for the National Assembly submitted to the government by the Democratic and Youth Parties, those with dual-party membership (i.e., former Kuomintang members) have been permitted by both parties to have their candidate qualifications revoked and be replaced through supplementary elections. However, both parties stated that those who were so-called dual-party members before the National Assembly last year should not be investigated, while those who engaged in dual-party behavior after the National Assembly will have their candidate qualifications revoked. Consequently, the original deadline of the 26th of this month for submitting the list of party candidates to the National Election Headquarters cannot be met, and will inevitably be postponed. The date on which the Democratic and Youth Parties will submit their revised lists is currently unknown, but the Kuomintang hopes to submit their list within three days, so that a joint list from the three parties can be submitted to the election authorities before the end of the month.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] The issue of overseas Chinese participation in elections has not yet yielded concrete results. The Overseas Chinese Election Office has reported to the General Election Headquarters the practical difficulties in conducting elections in various overseas Chinese communities, which has been forwarded to the National Government for instructions on how to proceed. The central government is still considering what method should be used for overseas Chinese to participate in the election. In order to uphold the principle of direct universal suffrage, voting by mail seems inappropriate, and exercising citizenship rights within the territory of other countries is also unfeasible. The central government may temporarily change the procedures for overseas Chinese elections, with the principle of not delaying the convening of the National Assembly on December 25th.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>President Truman's Appeal</h3>
<p>President Truman, in view of Europe's urgent need for aid and the alarming domestic inflation, decided to convene a special session of Congress on November 17th to jointly discuss the implementation of an emergency aid plan and curb rising domestic prices. Simultaneously, on the night of the 24th, he delivered a speech to the American people, clearly outlining the current domestic and international situation. On the one hand, he pointed out that the high cost of living in the United States was threatening domestic prosperity; on the other hand, he declared that the United States must provide assistance to alleviate the hunger and suffering of people overseas. Finally, he urged the entire nation to voluntarily conserve food to help those in need overseas.</p>
<p>The US government is so concerned about the hunger of the European people and will take immediate action to reduce the suffering of the European people. From a humanitarian standpoint, listening to President Truman's speech, one cannot help but think that this is good news for the European people. During the last war, European countries suffered greatly from the ravages of Nazi Germany, and were devastated by artillery fire. The material losses suffered cannot be estimated. France and Italy are especially impoverished, and their national economies and the people's livelihoods have reached the end of their rope. The lack of US dollars prevents them from importing domestic goods to maintain their minimum needs. The poverty of European countries after the war should have allowed them to concentrate on economic recovery, and avoid being caught up in the vortex of international disputes; but due to the evolution of the international situation after the war, it is impossible to seek the stability of the past. Therefore, some impoverished countries in Europe are still struggling in international disputes, which is truly a great tragedy for humanity.</p>
<p>It was generally expected that countries would suffer from hunger and cold after the war. Therefore, during the war, there was an initiative to organize the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA). After the war, UNRRA did play a role in relieving war-stricken countries, but it ultimately failed to save humanity from the sea of ​​suffering. UNRRA has long ended in Europe, and the hunger and cold of the European people remain the same. Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan for Europe should logically be welcomed and applauded by the people of European countries, but it has encountered great obstacles due to international disputes, and has not yet been implemented, awaiting discussion by the US Congress. Now the US authorities are loudly calling for emergency aid to Europe. Considering the actual situation in Europe, it seems that there will be no further resistance. However, international disputes are still enough to create obstacles to President Truman's implementation of emergency aid to Europe. According to a United Press report from New York on the 26th, the Soviet Union will launch a full-scale diplomatic offensive against the United States, with the urgent goal of defeating Marshall's economic plan for Europe. Putting everything aside, let's just talk about the impoverished situation of European countries, which urgently need foreign aid. Now there is a wealthy country that is willing to provide assistance with a compassionate heart. If another country not only stands idly by, but also attempts to undermine it, no matter from which perspective, one feels that this behavior is immoral.</p>
<p>The crux of the European problem today can be summed up in one sentence: it is the struggle for leadership between the United States and the Soviet Union. This has created an incompatible situation. The United States and the Soviet Union hold opposing attitudes on any issue in Europe. Not to mention that the problems that have occurred in Europe after the war cannot be reasonably resolved; even the German peace treaty, which is of vital interest to all countries in the world, is still in a stalemate and cannot be broken. Moreover, the Soviet Union has already erected an iron curtain in Europe, not only preventing people outside the iron curtain from entering, but also preventing any activities within the iron curtain from being detected. After the war, the world hoped for the realization of "one world," especially for Europe; but due to the existence of the iron curtain, the confrontation between the two camps is even more obvious. Judging from the declaration issued by the new Communist International in Warsaw, the common goal of the communist parties of the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia is to oppose the US aid plan for Europe.</p>
<p>After Marshall's aid plan for Europe was announced, we had already seen the opposition in Soviet newspapers and magazines. In the eyes of the Soviet Union, American aid to Europe is tantamount to enslaving Europe. Whoever is willing to accept American aid is willing to be a slave of the United States. This argument was able to resonate with the communist parties of eight European countries, and under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the new Communist International was established, targeting the US financial offensive and launching a counterattack. Some countries within the iron curtain, controlled by the Soviet Union, have long been involuntary. It is not surprising that they participated in the new Communist International. However, the communist parties of France and Italy, ignoring the suffering of the people and the interests of France and Italy, also joined the new Communist International. No wonder they are being spurned by the people. The misguidedness of the communist parties of France and Italy is sufficient to prove that Europe is still at a crossroads today. What will happen in the future? Can't make a decisive decision yet? The hesitating attitude of some people in Europe does increase the concerns of the American people about the issue of aiding Europe.</p>
<p>However, we also want the United States, both government and people, to reflect on themselves. The poverty of European countries has reached its extreme. As the saying goes, "a hungry person easily becomes food, and a thirsty person easily becomes drink." Why do some European countries still hold a hesitant attitude towards American aid? Putting aside the factors of international disputes, the United States cannot but bear considerable responsibility. First of all, we want the American people to understand that the diplomatic style of the era of power politics should no longer exist after the end of World War II. In the minds of Americans, the outdated concept of "dollar diplomacy" should not exist, that is, "if I help you financially, you have to listen to me politically"; otherwise, European countries would rather starve to death than accept American aid. We firmly believe that American aid to Europe is purely out of human compassion, and does not contain any intention. However, in terms of diplomatic style, we still have to ask the US authorities to pay special attention. Taking the issue of American aid to China as an example, we also deeply feel the same pain.</p>
<p>In short, the winter in Europe is coming soon, and the tragic scene of hunger and cold will appear before humanity again. President Truman's call is indeed good news for the European people. But how can Marshall's aid plan for Europe be fully implemented? We only hope that the US Congress can immediately find a satisfactory solution.</p>

<h3>Kaohsiung Port: History and Current Status</h3>
<p>Kaohsiung Port is the only excellent seaport in Taiwan and South China. When Director Zhang visited Kaohsiung Port 29 years ago, it was still called "Takow" and was under construction. Tracing back to the late Ming Dynasty, the Dutch occupied Beigang. After the Treaty of Tianjin in 1860, the British entered Kaohsiung via Xiamen, and established a customs office. The Germans also built a lighthouse on Shaochuantou Mountain. During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, they used high-pressure tactics to seize land and spent 40 years developing this only gateway in the south, ushering in the era of the sea and the Pacific era.</p>
<p>The area around the port of Kaohsiung is mostly plains, with a mild climate, mostly sunny and with little rain. Most of the heavy industry factories are located here. To the south of the port is a sandbar, 12 kilometers long and 200 meters wide, which is separated from the outer harbor, forming a natural breakwater. The area inside the port is 66,000 square meters. The port entrance is narrow, at 106 meters. During the war, the Japanese used it as a base for southward advancement, so it was 90% destroyed. After the restoration, the Port Authority salvaged 170 sunken ships, and cleared the port inside and out. Signals, buoys, floating barrels, docks, warehouses, cranes, port railways, and bridges have been mostly repaired and completed. Currently, it can simultaneously moor 29 ships under 10,000 tons. The warehouse can accommodate 124,000 tons of goods. From January to August of this year, 511 ships entered and exited, totaling 916,175 tons. Currently, port engineering is being actively strengthened. By the end of this year, ships under 10,000 tons are expected to be able to enter and exit freely, and the installation of night navigation equipment is underway. The port not only has to handle the import and export of local aluminum, alkalis, fertilizers, alkali manufacturing, shipbuilding, cement, kerosene, etc., but also the rich rice and fruits of southern Taiwan. In addition to supplying Taiwan's own use, it can also be exported in large quantities, especially sugar, which is the only export port for sugar, benefiting from the favorable weather conditions. In July of this year, the National Maritime Affairs Conference decided to make Kaohsiung an international trading port, handling domestic and foreign materials. Therefore, the Port Authority has now formulated a three-phase expansion plan to build a sound international trading port within two years. However, the port was severely damaged. After an inspection by an American expert, it was believed that even with the strong strength of the United States, its restoration would take more than three years. Therefore, it is necessary to change the fragmented view of the harbor and obtain the most generous economic assistance.</p>

<h3>Current Situation of Keelung Fertilizer Plant</h3>
<p>First Factory: The most important manufacturing plant of Taiwan Fertilizer Company, located in Waiheshan, Keelung City, covering an area of 165.29 square meters. Important equipment includes two 6,000 KW generators, each with a daily output of 40 tons of calcium carbide, one air liquefaction machine, which can produce 1,000 cubic meters of hydrogen and 250 cubic meters of oxygen per hour, twelve chemical kilns, each with a daily output of 3.5 tons, and one lime kiln, with a daily output of 70 tons of lime. It was heavily bombed during the war, but has now been repaired. From next year, it is expected to produce 35,000 tons of calcium hydride annually, an increase of one-half compared to the Japanese occupation period.</p>
<p>Second Factory: Before the war, it produced sulfuric acid, potassium superphosphate, and other various compound fertilizers, with an annual output of 800 tons of concentrated sulfuric acid, 16,000 tons of calcium superphosphate, and 20,000 tons of various compound fertilizers. It was bombed during the war, and now only three pyrite piles remain, each burning 7,500 kilograms of pyrite ore per day. The equipment for manufacturing calcium phosphate has completely disappeared. After the takeover, repairs began in February last year, and sulfuric acid phosphate fertilizer was produced in August, with an annual output of 15,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Director Zhang's Speech in Keelung</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] When I came to Taiwan 29 years ago, I also stayed in Keelung for one night. The official residence I lived in at the time has now been destroyed by bombing. Today, recalling the past, I have many feelings. In the past half-century, Taiwanese compatriots have suffered from the oppression of Japanese imperialism, and Keelung City has been destroyed by war. Fortunately, Taiwan has now been restored, and you are now Chinese citizens who enjoy freedom and equality. Keelung is an important seaport in the Far East. Whether in peacetime in terms of economics, or in wartime in terms of military affairs, it has great value. Keelung suffered particularly great losses in this war, and that is the reason. In the future, we must rebuild Keelung City and make it an important naval port for our country."</p>
<h3>The Production Situation in Taiwan Described by Wei Daoming in a Radio Address</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th] Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming listed various important production figures in his radio broadcast yesterday afternoon, explaining the progress made in Taiwan Province in the two years since its restoration. According to Wei, although the sugar production in Taiwan reached a maximum of over one million tons during the Japanese occupation, production had completely fallen into dependence when we took over. This year, the production is expected to recover to over 300,000 tons. Tea production was only 1.43 million kilograms per year at the time of takeover. Electricity could only generate 43,000 kilowatts at the time of takeover, but this year it has increased to 210,000 kilowatts. Coal production was only 14,000 tons per month at the time of takeover, but this year it has increased to 110,000 tons per month, with an annual output of over 1.3 million tons. Cement production was only 60,000 tons per year at the time of takeover, but it has now increased to 160,000 tons per year. Pineapple production was only 26,800 tons at the time of takeover, but this year it is expected to reach over 42,600 tons. The above are all more important production industries. Other aspects, such as transportation and roads, have also made significant progress.</p>
<h3>Xia Wei Talks About the Battle Situation in Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 26th] Our reporter recently interviewed Commander Xia Wei in Hefei and asked about the recent situation in the central and western Anhui war zones. According to him: (1) In the past ten days, only Qianshan and Taihu counties in central and western Anhui are still in the hands of the bandits, and the rest have been recovered. About a thousand bandits once reached the vicinity of Wangjiang, but only a very few smuggled across the river due to the river blockade. (2) Chen Yi's bandit troops returned from eastern Anhui to the south bank of the Yellow River to receive winter clothing from the bandits on the north bank and will continue to be stationed south of the Yellow River. (3) Although Liu's bandits are temporarily using the Dabie Mountains as a respite, the conditions for staying there for a long time are insufficient. Therefore, they often take advantage of opportunities to harass. At present, the pacification area's military force is very familiar with the geography around the Dabie Mountains. Fighting with them can suppress their arrogance.</p>

<h3>Bai Chongxi Broadcasts: The Meaning of Islamic Loyalty and Filial Piety</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Bai Chongxi, Chairman of the National Islamic Association, broadcast the meaning and hope of the "Loyalty and Filial Piety Festival" to Muslims nationwide from the Central Broadcasting Station at 8 p.m. on the 25th, which was the World Islamic "Loyalty and Filial Piety Festival." He briefly stated, "The 'Loyalty and Filial Piety Festival' can also be translated as the 'Sacrifice Festival' or the 'Festival of Sacrifice.' The Sacrifice Festival is for Muslims worldwide to commemorate the great acts of loyalty and filial piety of the Prophet Ibrahim, who obeyed the Lord's command, and Isma'il, who obeyed his father. According to the factual meaning, interpreted using Chinese ethical concepts and terms, it is a grand event of loyalty and filial piety within the family of the Holy Ancestor Ibrahim, who 'regarded command as life,' and Isma'il, who 'regarded death as returning home.' Therefore, the Chinese Islamic Association translated it as the Loyalty and Filial Piety Festival to make the meaning clearer. The meaning of loyalty is very broad, such as loyalty to the Lord, loyalty to the leader, loyalty to the country, loyalty to one's duties, loyalty to the people, loyalty to friends, and so on. We need to be loyal at all times and in all places in our dealings with people and in our lives, so 'loyalty' is the foundation of our lives. Secondly, those who can be filial to their parents can be friendly to their siblings, and then they can develop the great call to 'respect the elderly as we respect our own, and cherish the young as we cherish our own,' and the great beginning of human compassion, peace, sincere unity, and treating everyone equally. Therefore, 'filial piety' is the foundation of managing the family. Only by cultivating oneself and managing the family can one talk about governing the country and bringing peace to the world. Moreover, only those who can fulfill filial piety can fulfill loyalty. In ancient China, loyal ministers were always selected from the families of filial sons, which has a very profound meaning. Therefore, the meaning of filial piety is expanded, and it is still loyalty. The two words loyalty and filial piety are inseparable. Therefore, the Quran instructs 'filial piety to parents' as second only to 'serving the Lord.' Loyalty and filial piety should be the common ethical principles of mankind. I can say that if mankind does not practice the teachings of loyalty and filial piety, there will be no world, let alone a nation. Now, there is a group of armed rebellious bandits who disobey the orders of the supreme leader, destroy national unity, disturb local security, and put our compatriots throughout the country in dire straits. This is unfilial to the nation, and we should eliminate them. I hope that all Muslims across the country, based on the teachings of loyalty and filial piety, will bear the responsibility of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country with a spirit of sacrifice."</p>

<h3>Post-War Germany: Visiting the German Delegate to the World Young Women's Christian Association Conference</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Hong Xucai</p>
<p>In the World Young Women's Christian Association Conference held in Hangzhou, there was a German delegate, Ms. Cai Nake. She was the only representative from a defeated country because Japan, although also invited to the conference, was unable to attend due to opposition from the Eastern Control Commission. Undoubtedly, Ms. Cai will become the center of the news, but she is the most silent and lonely representative in the entire venue. A Mexican delegate told the reporter: "Her eyes are big and round, her pupils are dull, and her voice is low and hoarse. German women are really pitiful!"</p>
<p>On the night of the 21st of this month, after discovering her residence, I quietly ran to the Xileng Hotel to visit her. This was the smallest room in the hotel. Besides a bed and a table and chairs, there was no space left. Under the dim light, I saw Ms. Cai's gray hair and dry, wrinkled forehead. I estimated that she was an old woman over fifty years old.</p>
<p>After I explained my purpose, she immediately received me very politely and invited me to sit on the edge of the bed. She began to tell me why Germans were spending their bleak years in hardship. She said: "We are poor! We are hungry! After we eat breakfast every day, we will never have lunch and dinner again. It is a miracle for Germans today if they are not hungry for a day." Her tone was unusually hoarse and anxious, and she was interrupted from time to time by severe coughing, but she always tried to suppress it and described:</p>
<p>Germany is under the rule of the Soviet, U.S., French, and British four countries, and the entire territory has been divided into four parts. People cannot move freely. There is a housing shortage, coal shortage, and food shortage everywhere in Germany. Therefore, no part is allowed to move people in, resulting in wives and children being separated, and many families cannot reunite. After the great bombing of Germany, there are very few complete houses left. Some people are temporarily sheltering with relatives, but now they cannot go back. Ms. Cai came from Berlin. Berlin is now the location of the Allied headquarters, so the housing shortage is even more serious. People mostly use broken walls to shelter from the wind and rain. In addition, the climate is extremely cold. In the office during the day, the ink freezes for up to six hours. Because there was no coal last winter, those who were frozen to death alive, in Berlin alone, reached more than 1,500 people. She said: "I will never forget that one late night last winter, I vaguely heard trembling cries for help nearby. The next morning, two women were frozen to death."</p>
<p>The reporter really didn't want to hear more of these tragic stories. I interrupted her and asked her to talk about the living conditions of women during the war. She said angrily: Hitler's contempt for women was obvious. Before the war, he regarded women as tools for reproduction and stipulated that each family should have no fewer than four children. The father's salary must be based on the number of children, forcing women to return to the kitchen. When the war started, he conscripted all men over seventeen to fight, and women had to do all the hard work.</p>
<p>Ms. Cai is the chairman of the German Young Women's Christian Association, so the reporter asked if the Young Women's Christian Association had also been destroyed under Hitler's rule. Her answer was: "Only the freedom to read the Bible and pray." Thirty-five percent of the German people are Christians, but they are not allowed to have any organizations, and they do not even have the freedom for three people to walk on the road together. Ms. Cai was arrested several times and interrogated for several days and nights. One female youth association executive was sentenced to prison for talking about her dislike of war on the road.</p>
<p>At this time, her emotions gradually became agitated, and her voice became even more hoarse. She said word by word: "The suffering and torment that the German people endured under Nazi rule is beyond your imagination. When Berlin was heavily bombed, we did not sleep for forty days and nights. The scene was like a hurricane, like a volcanic eruption, like the sky was about to collapse. I simply cannot describe how terrifying it was..."</p>
<p>The reporter asked: "Do you believe that Hitler is really dead?"</p>
<p>She answered affirmatively: "One hundred percent, I am absolutely sure. This kind of person cannot live in this world now."</p>
<p>The reporter asked again: "Winter is approaching, will the situation in Berlin this winter improve?"</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders and shook her head, answering: "I don't know, but we pray day and night and believe that God will allow us to live."</p>
<p>She suddenly looked up at the sky. The waning moon was hanging high, and the cold air was coming from outside the window. It was late, and I said "good night" to this old woman, and returned with a heavy heart, stepping on the withered yellow leaves.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Resists Important International Activities: No Underlying Concerns in the United Nations; The Soviet Union Will Not Withdraw From the Alliance in the Short Term; However, Eastern European Countries May Withdraw From the United Nations Sooner or Later</h3>
<p>(United Press International, New York, 26th) Some representatives of the United Nations and diplomatic observers who have been paying attention to the United Nations since the beginning of the San Francisco Conference have recently reached the same point of view, that is, the Soviet Union is in fact "gradually withdrawing from the United Nations." However, in the foreseeable future, it will not formally abandon its membership. The Soviet Union will remain in the United Nations for as long as possible in order to use this international organization as a tool to explore ideas. At the same time, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries are gradually refusing to participate in the special activities of the United Nations. This policy can be called "technical resistance." As a result, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries refuse to participate in the four major plans of the United Nations and resist several important subsidiary activities. The Soviet Union has refused to participate in the Trusteeship Council for a year, on the grounds that the draft trusteeship agreement was not consulted with the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union does not agree to participate in the implementation of the draft. The Soviet Union also stated that the trusteeship agreement does not give non-independent people the opportunity to reach the stage of autonomy. Secondly, the Soviet Union and Poland bluntly refused to participate in the Balkan investigation team passed by the Economic and Political Committee and approved by the General Assembly. The investigation team is still waiting for these two countries, but they will never participate. The two countries and other Eastern European countries will never cooperate with the investigation team. Thirdly, the Soviet Union also has a seat on the small committee drafting the charter of the "Small General Assembly" that meets throughout the year to discuss peace and security issues, but the Soviet Union also refuses to participate and insists that the plan for the Small General Assembly is "illegal and contrary to the United Nations Charter." The Soviet Union and its satellite countries refused to have any connection with it. Fourthly, the Soviet Union has stated that it will resist the Korean Committee, whose task is to monitor the elections in South Korea and the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops. Under the current situation, the General Assembly will pass this U.S. proposal. If so, another institution that the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate with will be added. It is reported that the United States will eventually establish a government in South Korea and equip it with troops to defend against pro-Soviet groups in the Soviet-controlled area of North Korea. Although no one (including Americans) hopes to split Korea, it is generally recognized that under the current situation, this will be a logical result. In addition to resisting important institutions of the United Nations, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries also refuse to participate in several subsidiary organizations. The Soviet Union has long refused to participate in the Geneva International Trade Bureau Conference and announced last Saturday that it would refuse to participate in the Havana Trade Conference convened by the Trade Bureau at the end of the year. The Soviet Union resists the League of Nations Refugee Bureau and refuses to cooperate with other United Nations-related groups. However, most representatives believe that the Soviet Union will never abandon its United Nations membership unless the East and West groups are completely split and forced to do so. The reason why the Soviet Union does not withdraw from the alliance is that, in addition to intending to use the United Nations as a forum to express its views, there is also a major consideration, that is, no one dares to be the culprit for shattering the world's dreams. Although it is generally believed that the Soviet Union has become an opposing force to most countries in the United Nations, one day the Soviet Union, either voluntarily or passively, will break away from the world organization and stand on its own.</p>
<h3>The United Nations General Assembly Becomes a Battlefield: The Soviet Union Launches an Offensive Against the United States; Pan Youxin Is Instructed to Coordinate With the New Strategy</h3>
<p>(United Press International, New York, October 26) The Soviet Union has now launched a full-scale diplomatic offensive against the United States on a global scale. The debates in the current General Assembly are becoming increasingly intense, and Soviet propaganda in Europe has also been widely launched. The initial goals of the Soviet diplomatic offensive have been frankly clarified by Politburo member Zhdanov. He seems to be the spokesman for the Soviet ideological circles after the war and represented the Soviet Union at the Warsaw Conference of Communist Parties of Nine European Countries. He said: The urgent goal of Soviet foreign policy is to defeat the Marshall Plan for European economic assistance. Soviet diplomatic representatives are now fully active. The main speaker of Soviet propaganda is Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky at the United Nations General Assembly. His main assistants, Gromyko, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky (Manuilsky was once one of the persons in charge of the Communist International, which was dissolved in 1943), and other figures have all given endless speeches. Moscow's decision to send Pan Youxin as the ambassador to the United States is also related to this full-scale offensive. Pan Youxin is a newcomer in the Soviet diplomatic circles. He has only been in the diplomatic circles for six or seven years. From 1939 to 1944, he served as the ambassador to China. Later, he returned to his country due to illness. After recovering from his illness, he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Judging from Zhdanov's statement in Poland and Vyshinsky's speech in Success Lake, it is clear that the Soviet Union is impatient to adopt a diplomatic defensive position in the "Cold War."</p>
<p>(United Press, Beiping, 26th) Foreigners familiar with Pan Youxin here unanimously welcomed the appointment of Pan Youxin, the former Soviet ambassador to China, as the ambassador to the United States, but were also surprised. These people believe that Pan is not a stern person, and has a humble personality, and does not have the special characteristics of a diplomat, and has the demeanor of a university professor. He is serious on the surface, but never arrogant.</p>
<h3>China Proposes Suggestions for the Establishment of a Small General Assembly: Limited to Dealing With Situational Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, October 25] China and France jointly suggested in the United Nations that the "Small General Assembly" should not consider all "dispute" issues, because "situations" are not as urgent as "disputes." Gu Weijun, the acting chief representative of China, told the drafting committee today that "if the proposed Small General Assembly is granted the power to consider issues related to 'disputes,' it may arouse doubts about the real purpose of establishing the Small General Assembly. Ambassador Gu also asked, "If the Small General Assembly considers issues related to disputes, will it be possible to lower the moral status of the General Assembly. Gu said that the Small General Assembly he envisioned is mainly an institution for implementing the resolutions of the entire General Assembly. Although its responsibilities will include issues related to disputes, it shall not accept such issues until after the General Assembly has discussed them.</p>
<h3>The United Nations Committee of Three Arrives in Batavia From Australia: Indonesia Refuses Dutch Planes to Land in Yogyakarta</h3>
<p>(United Press International, Batavia, 26th) Nine members of the United Nations Tripartite Committee mediating between Indonesia and the Netherlands flew to Batavia from Sydney this afternoon. Representatives from the Dutch and Indonesian governments and the government of East Indonesia welcomed them.

<h3>The Soviet Union May Propose That Allied Forces Withdraw From Germany</h3>
<p>(United Press International, London, 26th) According to British authoritative sources, the Soviet Union may propose the withdrawal of Allied troops from Germany at the November foreign ministers' conference. Observers believe that the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw troops is an attempt to win world public opinion's sympathy for Soviet policy. It is said that the Soviet Union's recent proposal that Allied forces withdraw from Korea has already gained goodwill. The British side said that whether in Korea or Germany, after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, there will be strong pro-Soviet political organizations active in these areas.</p>
<h3>Bavaria Passes Anti-War Law</h3>
<p>(United Press International, Munich, 25th) The Bavarian parliament today unanimously passed a law allowing people to refuse to participate in combat, either actively or passively.

<h3>Anti-Communist Forces Still Exist in the Soviet-Occupied Zone of Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, Munich, 25th] A senior official of the Polish government-in-exile visited Bavaria and talked about the situation in the Soviet-occupied zone, saying that behind the Soviet troops, there are at least 50,000 anti-communist forces conducting guerrilla warfare.</p>
<h3>The British Representative Frankly Advises the Soviet Union: Should Abandon Narrow-Minded Ideas; The War Criminals Case Will Be Put to a Vote Today</h3>
<p>(United Press International, Success Lake, 25th) The United Nations Political Committee held its first test vote on the Soviet Union's proposal against war criminals today. As a result, 29 votes against 12 votes rejected the submission of the case to the drafting committee. The four Latin American countries, India, and Abyssinia joined the Soviet Union as a minority group. The case will be formally voted on Monday, and representatives expect that there is no hope for it to pass.</p>
<p>(United Press International, Success Lake, 25th) Britain today accused the Soviet Union of "poisoning" the atmosphere of the United Nations and demanded a clear answer. Is the Soviet Union still unable to satisfy its sense of security after controlling the area from the Elbe River to Vladivostok in Europe and Asia? British representative McNeil asked Soviet leaders to abandon their "policy of hatred" at the General Assembly.</p>
<p>He said that if the Soviet Union needs peace, it should believe that non-communists are not equal to fascists, and monopoly capitalists are not equal to guerrillas. McNeil made this statement in the final stage of the Western countries' fight against the Soviet Union's proposal to condemn war criminals. McNeil asked Vyshinsky to withdraw his proposal. This young diplomat is the second most important person in the British Foreign Office. He believes that if the Soviet people have the opportunity to express their views through freedom of the press, the chances of a new war will be greatly reduced. In general discussions, the United States strongly opposed the General Assembly passing any mild resolution, because the United States believes that any resolution will make the Soviet Union think that it has won another victory, and any resolution will be equal to admitting that the Western powers do have the suspicion of spreading war propaganda. Zhinsky is now preparing to make a final attack.</p>
<h3>"Truth News" Has No News, "News News" Has No Truth</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Success Lake, 25th) The Political Committee of the General Assembly continued to debate the Soviet Union's proposed "war criminals" resolution. The British and South African representatives both strongly criticized the Soviet Union's propaganda methods. British representative McNeil said that he strongly opposed Vyshinsky's use of the "scissors and paste" method to distort the meaning of newspaper texts out of context. But if the Soviet Union likes to use such methods, then he will retaliate with the same methods. So McNeil cited the remarks of the Soviet newspapers to prove that the Soviet newspapers did their best to distort the remarks of British representative Crow and other representatives in the United Nations institutions. He also said, "I, representing the British journalists, solemnly deny the claim that British journalists are engaged in false reporting. Vyshinsky is very good at using Russian idioms. I know a Russian idiom, which is 'Truth News' has no news, 'News News' has no truth."</p>
<h3>The Definition of War Criminal Changes With the Seasons</h3>
<p>McNeil also defended Turkey and felt deeply disgusted by Vyshinsky's disrespect for etiquette in attacking Turkish representative Saber. Strong countries should never use such methods to attack smaller countries, thus increasing the already existing misunderstandings. Everyone knows that Turkey, while actively developing a democratic system, is also resisting the Soviet Union, which has launched large-scale economic operations, with remarkable courage. When talking about the issue of war propaganda, McNeil also asked for a clear definition of war criminals. McNeil pointed out here that Molotov delivered a speech after the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty in 1939, accusing the Allied countries of launching an imperialist war against Germany. He also pointed out that just when Britain and France were fighting a desperate battle with Germany, Molotov also accused the leaders of the British and French socialist parties, such as Roy and Blum, of being war promoters. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's definition of war criminals changes with the seasons.</p>
<h3>The United States Celebrates Navy Day: Weapons and Tactics Will Be Completely Innovated</h3>
<p>(United Press International, Washington, 27th) Today is U.S. Navy Day. The Navy authorities are now planning to implement a fundamental revolution in the Navy's 172-year history, designing new warships, weapons, and tactics. There are three main points: studying the method of submarine diving for battleships, equipping rockets with atomic bombs, supersonic aircraft, and clearing the sky when necessary.

<h3>French Municipal Elections See Second Round of Voting: De Gaulle Still Holds Advantage; Herriot Re-elected Mayor of Lyon Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 26th Broadcast: Paris dispatch: The municipal elections in approximately nine thousand French towns and villages are expected to conclude today. De Gaulle's "People's Rally" still holds a dominant position, overshadowing the Communist Party. According to recent statistics, they have obtained approximately 40% of the total votes. The French Railway Workers' Association will convene on Monday, determined to achieve an 11% wage increase. The Central Association of Civil Servants will propose a general strike. The aforementioned organizations are all affiliated with the Labor Confederation led by the Communist Party. The workers' obstinate attitude seems to have a negative impact on the Communist Party's election campaign.</p>
<p>(United Press Paris, 26th) Municipal elections are being held on the 26th in 14,000 small towns in France with populations under 9,000. French law stipulates that an absolute majority is required to win in small towns. The election on the 26th is a choice by the townspeople from the candidates who received the most votes in the preliminary election last Sunday. In the brisk autumn breeze, the French people are in high spirits, participating in the political battle. The Communist Party and the De Gaulle faction are fighting to the death, while the Socialist Party is trying its best to improve its position between the two parties. Political observers predict that of the 1,700 mayors who were Communists in the previous municipal elections, the Communist Party, despite extensive publicity in the countryside this time, fears losing half of its mayoral seats due to the traditional conservatism of French farmers. National Assembly President Herriot was re-elected as Mayor of Lyon on the 26th, a position he has held for over 20 years.</p>
<h3>Ramadier Government Facing Serious Crisis; Parliament to Reconvene Tomorrow to Decide Its Fate</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 25th] The French National Assembly has been summoned to discuss the threats to French institutions and internal peace, as claimed by Prime Minister Ramadier. It will reconvene on Tuesday, 16 days earlier than scheduled. Prime Minister Ramadier has already reorganized his cabinet to more firmly resist pressure for wage increases and implement austerity measures. The situation the National Assembly will face is increasingly urgent due to the following two major developments: the establishment of the Communist Information Bureau in Belgrade, the French Communist Party's intensified opposition to the government, and the widespread demands for wage increases by the General Confederation of Labor controlled by the Communist Party; the increasingly acute dollar crisis; and the emergence of the People's Unity Movement led by De Gaulle. However, this complex and delicate political situation cannot be prolonged. From the government's point of view, if it wants to clarify the situation, it must take affirmative and resolute measures.</p>

<h3>British Admiralty Publishes Hitler's Secret Plan: Planned to Deal with the United States and the Soviet Union Separately</h3>
<p>(Associated Press London, 25th) The British Admiralty today released a report stating that Hitler personally ordered the German Navy in 1941 to avoid all incidents with the American fleet, intending to avoid war with the United States until after defeating the Soviet Union. Hitler even wanted to postpone operations in the Atlantic after President Roosevelt expanded American naval activity to Iceland. Even after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hitler still intended to avoid open conflict. The materials for the Admiralty report were obtained from German archives captured during the war. It revealed that Hitler was extremely confident in conquering the Soviet Union, believing that the Soviet Union could be defeated by the end of September 1941. After the end of the Eastern Front battle, he could seize the opportunity to take severe action against the United States.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Fatherland Front Issues a Declaration Criticizing Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Bulgarian Capital, 25th) The Fatherland Front Committee recently issued a declaration stating: The countries of the world have formed two major camps, one being the imperialist camp and the other the anti-imperialist or democratic camp. The former is led by the United States, aiming to economically and politically subdue countries devastated and impoverished by war, stifle their democracy, and rebuild the rule of reactionary and fascist forces. Bulgaria is bound by Greece and Turkey, and those countries have been transformed into bases for British imperialists, posing a constant threat to the independence and security of our country and other democratic countries in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Who is a friend and who is an enemy, every honest citizen can clearly understand today. The people remember the unfair interference of British and American imperialists in the Bulgarian parliamentary elections in 1945. At the Paris Peace Conference, they repeatedly adopted a hostile attitude towards Bulgaria. Their behavior in the Greek international investigation team and their rude intervention in the case of the Bulgarian national traitor, Petkov, have all revealed their true colors. In view of the above-mentioned international situation, the Fatherland Front Committee and all parties within the Front unanimously declare that Bulgaria's major interests are fully aligned with the anti-imperialist camp led by the great Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Suspected Embezzlement in Auction of Enemy Property; District Attorney's Office Indicts Four Customs Officials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The warehouse of Ruichang Hardware Store at No. 340 Dengtu Road was originally a secret warehouse of the Japanese, containing a large amount of materials. After the victory, it was taken over by the Third Front Army and handed over to the Bureau for Handling Puppet Properties, which then transferred it to the Customs for auction. It was discovered that a large amount of materials were missing. After three people, including Sun Zhuting, filed a complaint with the District Attorney's Office, the suspects, including Lu Shishang, were repeatedly summoned by the District Attorney's Office. The investigation was concluded the day before yesterday, and four people were indicted: Qian Zongqi, Deputy Commissioner of Customs; Huang Guojie, a detained Customs official; Lin Xuequ; and He Hengshan, who has repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned. According to the prosecutor's investigation, the Customs auction of materials on Dengtu Road advertised over 2,000 tons of pig iron, but only over 900 tons were sold, with over 1,000 tons missing. Huang Guojie and others involved are suspected of embezzlement. They are prosecuted under Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs; Liu Gongyun, former Director of the Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Properties; Chen Shouzhi, Chief of the Audit and Award Section; and Wu Rencang, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, are not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of crime.

The District Attorney's Office will report this to the Capital Judicial Administration Department and forward a letter to the National Defense Department for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Demanding Gambling Debts Requires First Striking Based on Rice Prices Results in Death: Three Suspects in the Brutal Murder Case at Xinbeimen Apprehended Within Ten Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 4:40 AM yesterday, a bloodstained murder case suddenly occurred at No. 64 Anren Street, Xinbeimen. A man was found lying on the roadside, covered in more than ten knife wounds, barely breathing. Due to the early hour, few pedestrians were around, and the assailant(s) calmly fled the scene after the incident. Shortly after, officers from the Fuyou Road Police Station, under the Yimiao Police Precinct, arrived upon receiving the report. They urgently summoned a vehicle to transport the injured man to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. He only managed to say: "My name is Shen Xingbin, in my thirties, from Huzhou. The perpetrators are Xu Xinglin, Zhang Asan, and Shen A'er, all three working as cooks at the Hero Harmonica Factory on Qiaojia Road in the city," and so on. He eventually succumbed to his severe injuries around 11:00 AM yesterday. Upon receiving the report, Deputy Precinct Chiefs Shen and Chen of the Yimiao Police Precinct immediately ordered Criminal Division Chief Zhou Nan to investigate. Investigator Jia Wenlin, Sergeant Bai Qingxiang, and officers Hong Yucheng, Zhang Minghui, Li Xuehuai, and Liu Zhicheng went to the scene of the crime, where they found:</p>
<p>A Finger</p>
<p>and a wire mesh bag left behind by the deceased, containing soap and other items, which they took to the precinct as evidence. They then went to the accounting office of the Shanghai Harmonica Factory at No. 110 Qiaojia Road to check the employee roster, which confirmed the existence of Xu Xinglin, who had been introduced to the factory as a food service worker by Wei Chensan. They summoned Wei for questioning, who stated: Xu accompanied his fellow villager Shen Xingbin to the North Railway Station before dawn and had not yet returned. Xu had a friend working at the Huacheng Can Factory at No. 61, Lane 68, Chengdu Road. The officers accompanied Wei to the factory to investigate, but</p>
<p>To No Avail</p>
<p>They then went with Wei to the residence of Xu's friend, Shen Hongren, at No. 4, Garden Village, Luban Road, and from Shen's place, they called Wei's cousin, Ms. Yang, who worked as a maid at No. 3, Lane 61, Fuxing Middle Road, to ask if Xu had been there. She replied that he was. The officers immediately drove over and apprehended Xu Xinglin, Zhang Asan, and Shen A'er all together, bringing them to the precinct for interrogation. Xu confessed to the murder of Shen Xingbin, stating: "Shen Xingbin and I are both from Daozhen, Huzhou. During the first month, we played pai gow for money, and my nephew, Asan, and I lost, so I borrowed 30,000 yuan from Shen.</p>
<p>Never Returning Home</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Shen came to Shanghai from our hometown on the 23rd and demanded 15,000 yuan from me at the harmonica factory, insisting on calculating it based on the price of rice, requiring no less than one dan. I negotiated with him to return home on the 11th to settle the matter, but Xu refused, saying that if I didn't pay, he would burn down my house. After he said that, he left. The next day, Zhang Asan, Shen A'er, and I discussed that he had also taken advantage of them, so we decided that we should strike first. If we didn't kill him,</p>
<p>We Would Be Harmed By Him</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 25th, Shen came to the factory again, saying he was taking the early train home tomorrow and asking if I had the money. I told him I was sure to pay him in November, but he said he wouldn't agree to November. I held back my anger at the time, being very polite and accommodating, and let him stay at my place. At around 4:00 AM yesterday, he got up to go to the station to catch the train. Zhang, Shen, and I pretended to escort him to the station, with Zhang Asan taking a cleaver and hiding it on his person. On the way, Zhang handed the knife to me. When we reached the entrance of No. 64 Anren Street, I aimed at Xu's head, intending to</p>
<p>Raise the Knife and Strike Down</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he turned around and snatched the knife away, slashing at Zhang Asan, causing a slight cut on Zhang's right thumb. Then, I struggled to regain the knife, and with the assistance of Zhang and Shen, we held his hands and repeatedly slashed at his head, face, limbs, and other areas more than ten times, until he collapsed to the ground, barely alive. We hurriedly fled towards Yangjiashan Alley, not daring to return to the factory. In the afternoon, we went together to Zhang Yang's place, intending to borrow money to sneak back to our hometown in Huzhou, but unexpectedly, we were apprehended," and so on. The entire case, from its occurrence to the arrest of all the perpetrators, took only ten hours, which can be considered swift.</p>

<h3>Police Officers Abuse Power, Destroy Local Autonomy, and Lead a Crowd to Demolish the Bao Office</h3>
<p>The joint office building of the 40th and other five Bao (neighborhood units) in the Xincheng District was previously demolished by police officer Song Shaomei of the Laozha Police Bureau, who abused his power and led a crowd. This has aroused anger among residents throughout the district. The district's residents' representative council has resolved to request that the city councilors from the district, Yu Chuanding, Zhu Yakui, Chen Gongda, and Tang Shichang, submit a request to the Municipal Council to forward it to the Municipal Government and the Police Bureau for investigation and to severely punish the illegal acts in court.</p>
<h3>Cotton Field Area in Pudong Expands; Cotton Ginning and Spinning Factories Improve</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the drizzling rain, accompanied by Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, and Hu Jingliang, Director of the Cotton Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, we set off for Pudong to tour the cotton fields, cotton ginning factories, and spinning mills in the area for an entire day. From 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM, for ten hours, bouncing around in a jeep, we only managed to visit Yangsi, Zhoupu, Nanhui, and Xinchang, seeing one spinning mill, four cotton ginning factories, and some scattered cotton fields.</p>
<p>When the jeep crossed the Tangqiao ferry, the first destination was the Hengda Spinning Mill in Yangsi District. This factory has a history of 27 years. The factory buildings are still new, and the machines are Lowell models from 1919. It currently has 21,600 spindles, with 18,000 spindles in operation, producing an average of 0.8 pounds of yarn every ten hours. It is currently planning to completely retrofit with Chinese standard large drafting equipment by the end of the year. The retrofitting cost is 400,000 Legal Tender (fabi) per spindle. The factory expects to install 10,000 new spindles of the 1947 English Smelly brand before the autumn of next year. Currently, its cotton yarn products are mainly six-count, sixteen-count, and twenty-count yarns under the Red Airplane and Color Airplane brands. At the beginning of this year, it added 400 new weaving machines, with 60 currently in trial operation, producing 12-pound fine cloth. It is expected to have all machines in operation by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The four cotton ginning factories we visited were the Hengyuan Cotton Ginning Factory in Yangsi District, the Zhengchang Cotton Ginning Factory in Zhoupu, the Shenjiu Cotton Ginning Factory in Nanhui, and the Rongchang Cotton Ginning Factory in Xinchang. The Shenjiu Cotton Ginning Factory is worth mentioning. In addition to its existing old factory, it has built a new factory and purchased a complete set of the latest American-style airflow saw ginning machines. Each of these American 32-inch diameter ginning machines has a capacity equivalent to 40 of our domestic roller ginning machines with the same diameter. Its characteristic is that from the intake of seed cotton to the packaging stage, all operations are done by machine. Lint, cottonseed, and hulls can all be automatically separated and collected, without requiring much manual labor. This entire set of ginning machines has now been installed and is expected to be test-run within about three weeks. The maximum daily ginning capacity can produce 2,000 dan of lint. It can be called the most advanced new cotton ginning equipment in the country.</p>
<p>Regarding cotton production, the total production in Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, and other places this year is estimated to be about 250,000 dan. According to cotton merchants, this year's harvest is good, with an increase of 30% compared to last year. However, compared to the pre-war annual production of 600,000 dan, it is still significantly lower. Nanhui accounts for the largest share of the production, about half of the total, followed by Fengxian, with Chuansha having the least. The improved cotton varieties from the Cotton Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry were also promoted in Guangdong Province for the first time this year. In Fengxian and Zhoupu, 7,000 mu were planted with Kezi cotton, and in Chuansha and Nanhui, 8,000 mu were planted with Dezi cotton, totaling 15,000 mu. It is estimated that these improved cotton varieties can produce 5,000 dan.</p>
<p>The highest price for seed cotton was 740,000 yuan per dan, and yesterday's price was 635,000 yuan. Based on this price, lint is worth 3,300,000 yuan per dan. Improved cotton fetches a price that is 30% higher than this. Based on these prices, the profit from growing cotton is much higher than that from growing rice. Therefore, it is generally estimated that the cotton field area will increase significantly next year.</p>
<h3>US Embassy Official Disappears While Flying a Plane; Found in the Suburbs of Nanjing After an Overnight Search</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] William, Taiaff, the Head of the Personnel Department of the US Embassy, went missing after practicing flying a small plane at Hongqiao Airport at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. A search was conducted throughout the night. At 7:00 AM yesterday, the Chinese Air Force finally located him 30 miles southwest of Nanjing. Fortunately, both the person and the plane were safe. According to William, he lost his way after flying out of Shanghai and was forced to land in the countryside.</p>
<h3>City's Land Tax Approved for Reduction; Grain Price Conversion Standard to be Determined by the Ministry</h3>
<p>The city's land tax for this year, after the city government submitted a request to the central government for a reduction, has been approved by the Ministry of Food to be reduced to 2.16 dou (unit of dry measure) per mu (unit of area), consisting of 1.2 dou in actual grain, 0.6 dou in requisitioned grain, and 0.36 dou in public grain. It was also stipulated that the conversion standard for the land tax should be calculated based on the grain prices during June and July of this year. However, the city government believes that it should be converted based on the grain prices of the two months before the tax collection, i.e., the average price of August and September of this year. The Finance Bureau has now drafted the conversion standard for this year's land tax.</p>
<h3>Car Fueling Temporarily Follows Previous Method</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Before a method for tiered allocation of fuel to automobiles is decided, the Public Utilities Bureau will continue to handle fuel distribution to cars in the city according to the original method. It has been decided to issue car fueling permits for November starting from October 30th. However, each fueling permit will indicate the car's tier so that the tiered allocation method can be implemented once it is decided.</p>

<h3>A Terrifying Profession: Beautifying Female Corpses - Conversation with Ms. Huang of Leyuan Funeral Home</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] There is a Ms. Huang at Leyuan Funeral Home, around thirty years old, with a charming demeanor. She wears a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, is dressed very demurely, and acts very gently, like a female teacher. She often sits in the accounting room by the switchboard, answering calls for people. People think she is an ordinary female employee of the funeral home, but she is actually highly skilled. Her job is to specifically clean, make up, and inject disinfectant into female corpses. Whether it is day or night, she is always alone in a small room, facing the corpses, undressing and dressing them, bathing and making them up, never asking for help. This kind of work is not open to viewing. She is the only woman in the funeral home, so she handles women's affairs by herself. Sometimes, when business is busy, three or four female clients arrive in a row. Ms. Huang bustles around, washing and cleansing their faces, applying powder and rouge, and dressing them up like jade flowers. When they are laid out in the mourning hall, everyone says their complexions are lifelike and their beauty is no less than in their prime. Who would know that this is Ms. Huang's hard work? It is said that once, when two female corpses arrived at the same time, one was being made up when her body suddenly twitched, her eyes seemed to open, and her lips moved. Someone timid would have been frightened out of their wits. Ms. Huang looked at her calmly, and she stopped moving. Upon closer examination, she was already completely dead and there was no hope of revival, so she ignored it. It is said that there was indeed an old lady who came back to life in her hands, but she went back to the road she came from within two days. This time, because of the news about Xiao Dangui, the reporter visited Ms. Huang again. According to Ms. Huang, she handled Xiao Dangui's final rites entirely on her own. She believes that many of the reports in the newspapers are exaggerated and do not match the facts. First, Xiao Dangui's coffin was bought from Yongxi Hall in the Shaoxing Guild Hall. It was not made of Phoebe zhennan, nor was it of Sha fang, but of Catalpa wood. It was worth only 30 to 40 million yuan. There were rumors of 150 million yuan, so even now, some people are sincerely going to see the coffin. Second, the item placed in the mouth is called Han Kou Ling (mouth filler), which is a small, copper-colored rhombus. The area is no larger than a lentil bean and is not valuable at all. It is mostly given as a gift by shroud shops. The rumor that a one-tael gold rhombus was placed in the mouth is also not true. Third, the copper gold ingots and silver ingots held in the hands were also fake. Other items, such as the more than twenty qipaos (traditional Chinese dresses) she wore before her death, cosmetics, perfumes, glass powder boxes, etc., were indeed present, but they were not valuable items. And the beads that were nailed on her clothes were the most basic small beads, worth only two or three thousand yuan each. Finally, Ms. Huang said: "The most unlucky thing this time was Leyuan Funeral Home, which lost tables, chairs, doors, windows, flowers, and trees worth about 200 million yuan, and no one has come to settle this bill yet!" The reporter said goodbye amid Ms. Huang's sighs. Ms. Huang chased after him and said loudly: "Please, reporter, mention in the newspaper that they should come and compensate quickly."</p>

<h3>Psychological Expert Sun Guiding Broadcasts Review of Mass Psychology</h3>
<p>Sufficient to Overthrow Despotic Regimes, but Unable to Build Free Countries; Sufficient to Destroy All Evils, but Unable to Create Any Welfare</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Our newspaper held its 30th special broadcast at the 99 Radio Station yesterday, inviting psychological expert and renowned professor Dr. Sun Guiding to broadcast a "Review of Mass Psychology." The gist of his speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>What is a mass? People generally think that a gathering of many people is a mass, but this is incorrect. The composition of a mass has certain conditions: (1) those who are concentrated in one place with the same goal, (2) those who have common emotions, and (3) those whose actions are sufficient to have influence and stimulation. For example, the bustling crowds on Nanjing Road come and go, each with their own purpose, which is not considered a mass. If a big fire occurs, many people have the same goal of watching the big fire and have the same curiosity and fear. These many people are the mass.</p>
<p>Freedom of Action Restricted</p>
<p>An individual in the mass is greatly influenced by the suggestive power of the mass. In the mass, an individual's actions are not free. At the same time, due to the effect of empathy, individuality is submerged. Therefore, an individual in the mass is completely without individuality and loses reason. An experienced orator, when entering a mass gathering, must first see if it is an open-air auditorium, because the reaction of the mass will be different depending on the environment. An experienced orator can make appropriate stimulation to the mass according to different occasions. Individual psychology and mass psychology are completely different. Individuals are mild and humble, but when they get into the mass, they often become rude and impolite. Even afterwards, they are surprised why there is such a big change in the mass, losing their original face.</p>
<p>Advocacy Prone to Change</p>
<p>Now, let's review the four characteristics of mass psychology: (1) The mass is fickle. The mass is different from an organized group. Tens of thousands of people will disperse due to a heavy rain, leaving no trace. When emotions are agitated, the mass will change its opinion due to external influences. The famous French historian Tain, in his writings, describes a passage about the Parisian mob riot. He said, "A crowd was gathered on a street in Paris, pointing out that a woman was a reactionary and wanted to kill her. An old man said, 'Don't be brutal, she is just a woman.' So the crowd shouted that the old man was a reactionary and turned to kill him. Suddenly a rascal jumped out of the crowd and said that the woman was the old man's daughter. The crowd laughed wildly, some bent over and laughed until their stomachs hurt, and the whole thing became nothing." The mass is so fickle.</p>
<p>Loss of Control</p>
<p>(2) The mass is credulous. There is no need to reason in front of the mass, because their ability to analyze and criticize is lost. An incorrect opinion is put forward in the mass and is accepted without consideration. (3) The mass is simple-minded. When talking to the mass, a few decisive words are enough. If words such as "suppose" and "however" are used in a dragging and repetitive manner, the mass will be bored. An agitator who is good at controlling the mass's mind only needs to simply say "Down with so-and-so" or "Support so-and-so" to the mass. (4) The mass is immoral. Because the mass has lost the ability to control and restrain itself, and individuals do not need to take responsibility for what they do in the mass, it is easy to be presumptuous and transgress. The so-called "atrocity" is produced from this psychology. The famous American professor Ross has two famous sayings: "The mass has the power to overthrow a despotic regime but cannot build a free country. The mass can destroy all evils, but cannot create any welfare."</p>

<h3>The Treasure Trove of Quartz in Suqian</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Suqian, 20th] Green Maling Mountains, inheriting the legacy of the Yimeng Mountains, meander beside Luoma Lake and extend all the way to Suqian City. Here lies a vast treasure, the home of glass – the quartz mine. As soon as our reporter arrived in Suqian, they immediately joined the inspection team led by Chairman Luan Xiang and County Magistrate Dong Jianhua, taking a special car to the production area for a visit.</p>
<p>White Horse Ravine Holds the Most Reserves</p>
<p>The quartz production area, as far as is known currently, is all around the Maling Mountains. It stretches approximately thirty li from north to south and twenty li from east to west, covering an area of about six hundred square li. A foreign expert once estimated that its reserves are enough to supply the world for thirty years.</p>
<p>We crossed the Liutang River, and impure quartz was found beneath the soil on both sides of the road. According to the County Magistrate, almost the entire area within these six hundred square li is like this. However, the richest reserves are in White Horse Ravine.</p>
<p>Crude Methods of Extraction and Processing</p>
<p>White Horse Ravine is just a place name, there is no village. There are many gullies and sandbars there, with a small amount of water flowing in between. In the soil layers on both sides of these numerous gullies and ravines lies the pure white quartz. Some are only inches from the ground, and the thickest are no more than three or four feet. Currently, no factories have been established yet; only some locals are using crude methods for extraction and processing, transporting a small amount to Shanghai. Because the quality is good, it is very popular with factories. In White Horse Ravine, we saw piles of quartz, which, after washing, had an irregular, granular appearance.</p>
<p>Zhang Jian's Achievements in Operation</p>
<p>There is a long history regarding past extraction efforts. In July of the 30th year of the Guangxu reign (1904), Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong, along with Xu Jiuxiang, Huang Boyu, and others, raised 500,000 taels of silver and petitioned the Nanyang Minister of the former Qing Ministry of Commerce for permission to establish the Yao Xu Glass Company. Formal operations began in July of the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign (1906), with Huang Boyu serving as the manager. The main products were plate glass and glass lamps, and the results were quite good. After the Xinhai Revolution (1911), due to the impact of war, business declined, and operations were suspended in the first year of the Republic (1912).</p>
<p>Visiting the Ruins, Nowhere to be Found</p>
<p>The factory was located on the north bank of the Grand Canal, covering more than two hundred mu of land with over six hundred rooms. After the shutdown, the factory land, machinery, and other items were still kept in the care of specific individuals, until Suqian fell to the enemy in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). A traitor, Wu Ziyun (the puppet District Chief of the 8th District of Suqian), colluded with the Saito unit of the enemy forces, who dismantled and transported the machinery. Wu, the traitor, sold off all the buildings. Now, not even a tile remains, and it is impossible to find the ruins.</p>
<p>Glass School Once Established</p>
<p>Before the war, there was also a glass vocational school in Suqian, founded by Mr. Zhang Jian. It had many complete instruments. During the War of Resistance, some of it was lost, and some was buried underground beforehand. Because the time was too long, the markers were gone, and it is currently being searched for. The school site was southwest of the city. The former laboratory now only has a large opium den standing, with no machinery or buildings left.</p>
<p>Glass Machines Lack Funds for Transport</p>
<p>Last October, someone from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) came to Suqian to inspect and indicated that they could provide two glass machines unconditionally for use. However, at that time, the transportation costs for these two machines would require more than 4 billion (currency units), which was unbearable in the impoverished county town. Therefore, this plan fell through.</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee Plans for Mining</p>
<p>However, the bright, sparkling light of glass continues to shine in the hearts of the people of Suqian. They believe this is a national resource, as someone once estimated that the reserves here would rank second in the world. They are now organizing a preparatory committee, preparing to suggest to the provincial authorities and the Resources Commission that they plan for mining as soon as possible, to benefit the local area and increase national wealth.

<h3>Child Bandits Discovered in the South China Sea Brandishing Short Guns, Threatening Sampans</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guangzhou, 22nd] In Guangdong, where bandits are rampant, their power has been increasing since autumn. News of robberies of transport ships on various rivers is heard daily. What is even more shocking is the emergence of lawless child bandits. Recently, frequent robberies and killings have occurred on rivers near Donggua Hou and Yinhe in the Nanfu area of Nanhai County. Every sampan passing through is forced to pay a "protection fee" of 200,000 yuan. If a boat refuses to pay, the sampan is detained or shot at. The bandits entrenched there are actually children around twelve or thirteen years old, all dressed in yellow twill shirts and pants, with short guns at their waists, resembling heroes of Liangshan Marsh. According to informed sources, this group of child bandits numbers nearly a hundred and is commanded by remnants of the "Protecting Sand Brigade Commander," a large bandit group from the enemy-puppet era named Gong Zhuo. Most of them are the children of bandits, truly "hereditary thieves." The area is located at the junction of Nanhai, Panyu, and Shunde counties and has long been a hideout for major bandits. Since the discovery of this group of child bandits, sampan merchants have been hesitant to move forward, contributing to the recent surge in firewood prices in Guangzhou. This can be described as a new scene in a chaotic world.</p>
<p>According to a visitor from Jieyang, Mr. Zhang of Xiecuoliao Village in Jieyang County recently unearthed a wooden coffin while digging on his ancestral mountain five li outside the village. The exterior was completely rotten, and it crumbled at the touch. It was believed to be an old coffin from 200 years ago. However, the corpse inside was not decayed at all, and the remains were still intact. The deceased was a sixteen-year-old girl, with a beautiful face as if alive, but the clothes disintegrated upon touch. The features and limbs were perfectly preserved. The coffin opener was shocked and at a loss. Upon receiving the news, the local charity urgently prepared incense, paper money, and sacrificial offerings to pay respects and replaced the girl's clothes before reburying her. Villagers flocked to offer sacrifices. Unfortunately, there was no inscription, so it is unknown who this woman was. (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)</p>
<h3>Fujian Agricultural Improvement Office Launches Winter Cultivation</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou, 22nd] Farmers in Fujian Province traditionally do not practice winter cultivation, but in recent years, due to the shortage of agricultural products, rural hardship, and the government's active promotion, more people are engaging in winter cultivation. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Office is now launching a large-scale winter cultivation plan, organizing supervisory teams to go to various counties to guide farmers. It is reported that the winter crops being promoted this year will mainly focus on "green manure" in addition to soybeans, wheat, and other crops. This "green manure" consists of more than twenty types of wild legume crops, such as Chinese milk vetch. They can grow and flourish on their own after sowing without the need for fertilization. When they mature, they are plowed into the soil to become natural fertilizer, which can greatly increase the yield of spring crops in the coming year. The use of this fertilizer in the farmland of northwestern Fujian Province has already shown effective results. In addition, the office will assist farmers in preventing and controlling agricultural insect pests, which are a concern in Fujian Province.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Makes and Issues "Glory Plaques" to Encourage Servicemen and Their Families</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Pinghu, 24th] To encourage the honor of soldiers serving in the military and to comfort the spirits of their families, the Pinghu County Government has specially made and issued "Glory Plaques," which are nailed to the doors of military dependents' homes to provide inspiration. A Dispute Arises Over Rescuing Cotton in Anyang</p>
<h3>A Dispute Arises Over Rescuing Cotton in Anyang</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhengzhou, 20th] The matter of rescuing the 10,000 bales of cotton left in Anyang by air transport was just concluded yesterday. However, a dispute arose during the conclusion. Because Chennault, the person in charge of the China-America Cooperation Organization (中美公司), agreed to send planes to rescue the cotton in Anyang after hearing the Rescue Committee say that they would take 15% of the value to help Anyang students who had fled to Zhengzhou, the Trial Committee also issued a check to the Mo Sheng, saying that each student should receive a cotton coat and a cotton quilt after the cotton was rescued. Now that the cotton has been carried out, they are only willing to give each student a relief fund of 500,000 yuan. The Anyang students were indignant and went to a National Assembly representative surnamed Liu (from Anyang) to complain and ask him to uphold justice.</p>
<p>It is said that although 10,000 bales of Anyang cotton were transported out, some of them belonged to a certain military unit, so some of the merchants' cotton has not been transported out yet. At the same time, they also suffered a loss, which is that although more than 500 bales of cotton have not yet been transported, the merchants are responsible for the assessment and payment, so the amount of relief funds has been reduced even more. In the distribution of relief funds, some ignorant agencies and idle people also went to compete for a share, making it even more difficult for the Rescue Committee. As a result, they had to resort to the method of publishing a thank-you notice in the newspaper to avoid offending some people who could not get the money.</p>
<h3>Those Who Stole and Sold Ammunition Caught Red-Handed, Three Soldiers Executed by Firing Squad, Remaining Criminals Punished with Caning in Public</h3>

<h3>Zhou Gengsheng Talks to Wuhan University Alumni in Shanghai, Four Research Institutes of Wuhan University Plan to Expand Equipment on a Large Scale to Become the Academic Research Center of Central China</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Zhou Gengsheng, President of Wuhan University, went to Nanjing to attend the Academician Review Meeting and came to Shanghai the other day. The supervisors and directors of the Shanghai Alumni Association of the school held a banquet yesterday at the savings department of Siming Bank on Nanjing Road. Professor Zhang Zhifu, Director of the Accounting Department of the National Resources Commission, was also invited to attend. During the banquet, Zhou said that it is easier for professors to approach students, while administrative work unconsciously alienates students and colleagues, causing spiritual pain.</p>
<p>Wuhan University returned from western Sichuan without receiving any transportation conveniences from the government. Zhou believes that the speed and certainty of the repatriation work were due to the unity and efforts of teachers and students inside and outside the school. After returning, in addition to restoring the original College of Agriculture, colleges of Arts and Medicine were also added. The construction of college buildings and hospitals is the most gratifying achievement, otherwise the construction cost of billions of yuan at that time would cost hundreds of billions today.</p>
<p>Regarding the June 1st Massacre that occurred at Wuhan University, Zhou believes that it is purely a political issue. However, rational political methods can achieve a reasonable solution. Wuhan University's style has always been independent and generous. As long as there is no action to undermine the government, the school is absolutely responsible for the safety and freedom of teachers and students. The school has not arbitrarily expelled students this term, nor has it dismissed professors without cause. Wuhan University has gradually made achievements in academic work in recent years. The four quarterly journals of Arts, Philosophy, Social Science, Science, and Engineering are about to be fully restored. The four research institutes of Arts, Science, Law, and Engineering also plan to expand equipment on a large scale and increase the number of books to become the center of academic research in Central China.</p>
<p>Zhou expressed his agreement in principle with Hu Shi's plan for educational independence, but five or ten schools are another issue. Zhou finally believed that if educational funding is not enriched, it will be difficult to achieve good results. If it can be combined with a comprehensive and stable environment, it will not be difficult to catch up with the improvement of academic standards.</p>
<p>[Another News] The Shanghai Alumni Association of Wuhan University will hold a celebration meeting for the anniversary of the mother school at the Nanjing Road Nanguo Restaurant at 2:00 PM on November 2nd. It was originally intended to invite President Zhou to attend and preside over the meeting. It is heard that Zhou said that after meeting Minister Wang Shijie in Shanghai today, he will return to Nanjing and fly to Wuhan to personally preside over the grand celebration of the 35th anniversary of Wuhan University.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Dispatch] One week, four days of matches, this is a special scene in this year's Hong Kong football league. Therefore, Wednesday and Thursday were lively with cheering everywhere.</p>
<p>Devon Defeated Again</p>
<p>On Wednesday (the 22nd), there were three matches. At the So Kon Po ground, two army teams fought fiercely. Against expectations, the Tai Nees Mundiven team defeated the Devon team 4-2. As a result, the strongest team of foreign soldiers lost four points in the league, and their chances of winning the championship were greatly reduced. At the police ground, China played against the police. In terms of strength, there was no comparison, but the police team has always been known for their "smokiness." The match was full of fighting spirit. China only wanted to win and barely won 2-1.</p>
<p>Kitchee's Good News</p>
<p>At Causeway Bay, the defending champion Kitchee played against the Hong Kong Club. The Hong Kong Club played well, causing Kitchee to win only 3-1 in the first half, but lose 2-3 in the second half. The overall result was 5-4, Kitchee winning by only one goal.</p>
<p>The development of the match was full of emotion. The goals scored were exquisite. Zhaorong opened the scoring first. The Hong Kong Club's right winger quickly headed in to tie the score. After that, Zhaorong passed in, and Yingqi's one-on-one attack was successful, making the score 3-1 in the first half. In the second half, Hualiu of the Hong Kong Club scored a penalty, making the score 3-2. Yingqi and Hong Kong Club's center forward Lie Wen each scored two goals to end the match. Kitchee's lineup: Zhu Zhaoheng, Zeng Zhongyun, Hou Rongsheng, Tan Zhenhui, Song Lingsheng, Liu Songsheng, Huang Jingting, Li Zhaorong, Guo Yingqi, He Qingfen, Deng Guangsen.</p>
<p>Sing Tao's First Victory</p>
<p>On Thursday (the 23rd), there were also three matches. After Sing Tao suffered a crushing defeat of 2-7 to Kitchee, they should have performed better against St. Joseph's today, but they still played like a scattered sand, winning 2-1, which was really a lucky win.</p>
<p>In terms of lineup, Sing Tao mobilized eight major players who had traveled far. The St. Joseph's team also had Xiao Gaoshan Nu in the lineup and borrowed good players such as Jia Hualu and Chen Lixiweiya from Macau, so they played vigorously.</p>
<p>The match was spent in fierce competition. In the first half, the situation belonged to the St. Joseph's team. In the second half, after Jia Hualu was injured, Sing Tao was able to turn the tide. In the first half, each team got a penalty kick, but Jia Hualu scored, while Jingxiang missed, so Sing Tao lost first. In the second half, Jia Hualu was injured, and the Lido team poured in, Li Dianqi shot an empty goal, tying the score. After that, although the St. Joseph's team was besieged, the goalkeeper Zhang Dangao performed well, so Sing Tao could not do anything. As time was running out, Qiu Shi stole an offside opportunity and pushed the ball in, thus angering the St. Joseph's team. The two teams' lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Sing Tao: Yu Yaode, Mo Jiesong, Hua Tianshen, Xu Jingcheng, Shan Yousheng, Feng Kunsheng, Cao Qiuting, Pi Shuping, Zhang Jinhai, Feng Jingxiang, Li Yanqi.</p>
<p>Other Two Matches</p>
<p>In the other two reports, the outcomes were inevitable. Ba Shi defeated Guanghua 6-0. Guanghua's defeat was their own fault. The reason for the crushing defeat was that the lineup changed too much. The lineup was different in every match, so how could the players play well? Eastern won against the Navy 4-2.</p>

<h3>Hualian Says Goodbye in Singapore; Defeats Malaysia 2-0; Li Yao and Long Hai Cooperate to Break the Enemy's Goal Twice</h3>
<p>[Guoguang News Agency, Singapore, 20th Dispatch] The Shanghai Hualian Football Team said goodbye yesterday, competing against the Malaysian team. The Malaysian team is known for being brave. The audience was very enthusiastic. Consul General Wu and his wife, and Deputy Consul General Xu and his wife, also attended on time, with enthusiastic mood.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, the referee Rong Yu took the field, and the two armies chose their positions. Shanghai was in the south and Malaysia was in the north. Malaysia kicked off from the center line and attacked, but were repeatedly blocked. Hualian tried to attack, but there was no development. After about five minutes of stalemate, Li Yuan got an opportunity and dribbled the ball quickly. La Shou was tackled, and hurriedly passed to Neng Hai, who scored a corner kick. Li Yuan attacked again without success. In the melee in front of the enemy, Chunhua was alert and tried a cold shot. Long Hai headed the ball into the net. Cheers erupted, and Hualian took a 1-0 lead. The agile Lianji Foot showed again, advancing on the left, right, and center, but there was no chance to enter. Malaysia counterattacked, like overturning mountains and overturning seas. Qixiang, Shixin, and Nengbo stood guard, forming a bronze wall and iron fortress. The enemy's offensive gradually declined. Hualian took a break. Jinshun and Yichen went deep on the left and passed to Li Yao. Li Yuan raised his arm and shot hard. Long Hai jumped up and added a header, which was wonderful. The Shanghai army scored again, and the first half ended with 2-0.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>In the sound of the resumption of the battle, Hualian was as steady as Mount Tai. Jinshun had seen success in the first half, and at this point, he swung the ax boldly, slashing wildly, but it was still ineffective. Malaysia lost two cities and fought to the death. However, the defenders such as Qixiang were seamless. After maneuvering for more than ten minutes, the Malaysian army suddenly stopped. La Shou was especially fiery. Seeing that the forwards were powerless, he personally came to the rescue. However, he was exhausted from the long journey, and there were also many concerns in the rear, so the attack was difficult to achieve. The veteran Banglun calmly dealt with it. When the legal time was over, Hualian still defeated Malaysia 2-0.</p>

<h3>Government Implements Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn; Hopes Cotton Spinning Industry Will Cooperate to the End; Minister Chen Expresses Determination Not to Exploit Legal Profits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs met with Mr. Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, at his residence at about 3:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on the upcoming joint distribution system of cotton yarn. Minister Chen stated that since he took office as the Minister of Economic Affairs, he has attached great importance to the cotton spinning industry. The National Textile Industry Production Conference held in September this year was to study how to guide China's textile industry to gradually achieve the plan of increasing production and development in a short period of time. The implementation of this joint distribution system of cotton yarn is only a link in the government's overall policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, and can only be handled under orders. The government is determined not to exploit the legitimate profits of the cotton spinning industry, so it is hoped that the industry will understand the government's good intentions and cooperate to the end.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang then explained to Minister Chen the difficulties currently faced by the private cotton spinning industry, one being the difficulty in sourcing raw cotton, the second being the shortage of operating funds, and the third being the frequent disconnection between the agreed price and the actual cost, which makes the general industry feel that the problem of reproduction is often threatened. Therefore, the industry felt that it was difficult to comply with the implementation of the joint distribution system. Minister Chen requested that the industry's willingness to cooperate would be conveyed to all colleagues.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association to Hold Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association will hold a temporary council meeting this morning, at which the chairman of the association, Wang Qiyu, will report on the meaning of the meeting with Minister Chen, and discuss it at the same time, so as to collect the industry's final opinions on the joint distribution system.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Import and Export Industry; 300 Companies Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Industrial and Commercial Counseling Office is conducting an investigation of the import and export industry in this city. The investigation period is three months, and the estimated number of companies to be investigated is 1,300. Currently, about 300 companies have been investigated. The scale of import and export companies in this city varies greatly. Large companies have many employees, while small companies are simple in scale, and some even have only one person handling all affairs. As for the business situation, it is generally good, because due to foreign exchange fluctuations, it is possible to make a large profit with just one successful transaction.</p>
<h3>Domestic Exchange Rate Decreases</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The domestic exchange rate of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be adjusted again by region from the 27th, and most of them will be reduced. The adjusted exchange rates for each region are as follows:</p>
<p>Xiamen: 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan; Fuzhou: 80 yuan; Quanzhou: 120 yuan; other places in Fujian: 100 yuan; Guangzhou: 80 yuan; Shantou: 90 yuan; Haikou: 100 yuan; other places in Guangdong: 90 yuan; Wuzhou: 80 yuan; Nanning: 80 yuan; other places in Guangxi: 80 yuan; Changsha, Hengyang, and other places in Hunan: 60 yuan; Lianyungang and Xinpu: 25 yuan; Hankou and Wuchang: 60 yuan; Shashi, Yichang, and other places in Hubei: 100 yuan; Nanchang: 30 yuan; Jingdezhen: 50 yuan; Jiujiang and Ji'an: 40 yuan; Ganzhou and other places in Jiangxi: 50 yuan; Ningbo: 6 yuan; Shaoxing: 8 yuan; Chongqing and Chengdu: 10 yuan; Yunnan: 25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tungsten Sand Smuggling Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs increased the purchase price of tungsten sand, tungsten sand smuggling has gradually decreased. The amount of tungsten sand purchased by the Third Special Mining Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has doubled compared to the past.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Exports in South China; Rice and Oil Account for the Majority</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Due to the recent rise in Hong Kong dollars, the amount of smuggling in South China has also been affected and has suddenly increased. It is reported that smuggling exports are mostly rice and oil. Many smugglers have shifted their routes, using Xintang in the East River and Jiangmen in the West River as their bases. However, under the strict investigation by the customs, more than 10,000 kilograms of smuggled rice have been seized in three weeks of this month.</p>
<p>Cigarette Crushed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened steadily. At 9:15, a small number of transactions began. Because Yizhong and other out-of-town colleagues were still selling, the purchase sentiment was slack. As a result, ten Old Knife cigarettes from British American Tobacco fell by 150,000 yuan. The prices of other Chinese and foreign brands of cigarettes fell more than they rose.</p>
<p>Soap Candle Downstream</p>
<p>The daily-use soap market was not smooth, and there were sales, so the price of Guben Arrowhead soaps fell by 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The markets for other brands of soap, matches, and candles also trended downstream.</p>
<p>Kerosene Fell</p>
<p>The wholesale kerosene market has a large supply of goods at the price of 2.9 million yuan per barrel, so the market is well-stocked and the price has also fallen. The price for high-grade barrel goods was 2.9 million to 3 million yuan, and the price for canned goods also fell by 400,000 yuan. The retail price was 8,000 yuan per box and 8,500 yuan per full pound.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The first meeting of the Council of the Central Trust Bureau after the reorganization will be held at the bureau at 3:00 PM today. At the meeting, the standing directors and chairman will be elected, and the director of the bureau will be appointed.</p>
<p>The Textile Export Committee, jointly formed by the Textile Adjustment Committee of the Central Bank and the China Textile Company and other relevant agencies, has been prepared and will be formally established today, and will be working at the China Bank at 15 The Bund.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the absorption of overseas remittances, the government will expand the remittance locations in Southeast Asia, expanding remittances by the Postal Savings Bureau and the Bank of China. Using post offices across the country to remit money will facilitate overseas Chinese and greatly absorb overseas remittances.</p>
<h3>Allocation Quota Announced Too Late; Guangdong Customs Revenue Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Since the implementation of the import management system, the allocation of import quotas for each quarter is announced and implemented too slowly. It is only announced at the end of each quarter. Therefore, in order to purchase their needs, manufacturers and importers have to rely on smuggled imports. This affects the industrial and commercial sector on the one hand, and has a significant impact on customs revenue on the other. After the completion of the import of the second quarter of this year, the daily tax revenue of the customs has dropped from 600 million yuan to more than 30 million yuan, a sharp decrease of nearly 20 times. As of the 26th of the third quarter, the first permit has not yet been issued.</p>

<h3>The Airplane of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Meng Kun</p>
<p>The progress of airplanes is much faster than that of other inventions. It has been almost 500 years since we first understood the structure of bird wings and the principles of soaring, but the date when the Wright brothers in the United States created the first aircraft was only 1903, which is only 44 years ago. In these 44 years, all scientific successes, such as printing, gunpowder, anti-tuberculosis drugs, guns, ships, skyscrapers, and atomic theory, have also made amazing leaps forward, but they are not as fast as the progress of airplanes, especially after this great war.</p>
<p>The first airplane 44 years ago only flew in the air for 12 seconds, a distance of more than 100 feet. 44 years later today, not long ago, Orton flew the "Renault Shell" around the world in just 74 hours. In this short period of 44 years, the development of airplanes has indeed been too fast. Its milestones can be proven by the following series of facts: In 1905, the Wright brothers created a flight record of 40 kilometers; in 1911, the first airplane assisted in the Italian attack on Tripoli; in 1927, Lindbergh (C.A. Lindbergh) flew alone from New York to Paris; in 1933, Post flew around the world; in 1935, the Soviet Gorky airplane appeared, carrying more than 100 passengers. After that was the period of rapid advancement in flight technology, which was also the outbreak of World War II. In this cruel process, the speed of airplanes exceeded the speed of sound, the load reached 20 tons, the altitude exceeded 10,000 meters, and the average output was one airplane completed in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, this progress is still continuing, and developing even faster. Therefore, the airplane of tomorrow will also be different from the airplane of yesterday and today. This difference is not only in the numbers, but more in the performance and quality. There is no doubt that a new century of airplanes will unfold from now on. According to recent reports in newspapers and magazines, the progress route of tomorrow's airplanes roughly follows the following directions.</p>
<p>In terms of form. In the past, airplanes were only divided into single-wing or bi-wing. The latest type of airplanes in the war gradually imitated cigars; in order to increase speed and prevent air resistance to objects, tomorrow's airplanes will appear in the shape of a projectile, seemingly without a tail, and the wings will really be like bird wings, shorter and rounder. In addition, formal changes will be excessively large or exceptionally small. Of course, although the improvement of form is the most obvious improvement, it is not the most important improvement, and the improvement of form is subordinate to the improvement of performance.</p>
<p>In terms of performance. Some people think that the performance of airplanes is perfect, but in fact and in theory, it proves that airplanes still have a lot of room for development. The highest speed at the end of the war was nearly 800 kilometers per hour. In the past two years, it has been rumored that an airplane with a speed of 1,000 kilometers has appeared; the speed of this airplane has exceeded the speed of sound and is approaching the Earth's rotational speed. If there is a continuous supply of atomic energy, it can circle the Earth in 24 hours and fly forever in the sunlight. In terms of capacity, the largest American airliner is no less than a small steamer, with restaurants, dance halls, cinemas, libraries, and swimming pools. Even the latest "Boeing" Model 36, which is used for military purposes, can carry nearly 50 tons. At the same time, it is said that "Boeing" Model 42 is also being produced. The maximum altitude can reach about 13,000 meters, which is already in the stratosphere. The range can reach at least 10,000 kilometers. In this way, airplanes will replace all flying machines, and balloons, airships, and kites will be eliminated. In addition, the theory of airplanes taking off and landing vertically is also gradually being completed. It may not require any wide flying field, but it is currently only applicable to pocket-sized small airplanes for people to play with, and they can already land or take off on the road, and some can be parked on the roof.</p>
<p>In terms of driving. Airplanes that were previously propelled by various engines are likely to be replaced by atomic energy engines. Atomic energy airplanes, it is said, have similar designs completed in the United States and the Soviet Union. The potential energy of the atomic nucleus is used to supply power. With this new success, the speed and range of airplanes can be greatly improved, and airplanes can also be much lighter. In addition to atomic energy, the application of the rocket principle to airplane devices is becoming increasingly realized due to the success of missiles (V1); however, it may not be possible to immediately achieve the goal of launching airplanes to the moon, enabling airplanes to escape the air and advance in a vacuum. In addition to the improvement of power, radio driving technology is also gradually being perfected. Recently, an airplane of this type has crossed the Atlantic Ocean, which is indeed a major commemoration worth celebrating in the history of airplanes. The establishment of this system, applied to long-distance or high-altitude flights, can prevent flight personnel from encountering the fate of being tired and sacrificed.</p>
<p>In terms of effectiveness. The effectiveness of airplanes is not limited to war, but in order to serve the war, the service capacity of airplanes in peacetime has also been expanded. Airplanes can now be used for transportation, as hospitals, measuring land, ground, stars, and climate, not just carrying passengers and mail. Moreover, even in terms of carrying passengers, the emergence of silent airplanes will greatly increase the comfort of passengers. In addition, the flying skills of tomorrow will be particularly simple, similar to driving a car. Anyone only needs a short period of learning and practice. Airplanes will be popularized, and will be related to the general public.</p>
<p>In addition to these, such as the use of plastic as a material for airplanes, making airplanes light, strong, beautiful, and the improvement of airplane manufacturing technology, which will enable airplanes to be produced in large quantities, are all inevitable advances in the future. It is generally expected that by the time of the 50th anniversary of the invention of the airplane, all aspects of the airplane will definitely be several times better than today. The progress of airplanes is part of the engineering of human wisdom.</p>
<h3>A Postscript to the Annual Meeting of Physics</h3>
<p>— Chen Yuesheng</p>
<p>Although there were no particularly lively signs or particularly pleasant cheers to be seen or heard on October 10th this year, Shanghai had the grand event of the annual meeting of the Chinese Physical Society, adorning our third National Day holiday after victory. Members from the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas, with excited spirits and relaxed moods, ran to the Academia Sinica on Yueyang Road to participate in this very meaningful gathering of scholars. At the same time, they also held a heart of happily meeting old and new friends, wanting to take this opportunity to pour out their accumulated feelings with colleagues whom they had not seen for a long time, or whom they could not often meet, or whom they had long wanted to know.</p>
<p>Wu Youxun, the president of National Central University, was the speaker at the annual meeting, and arrived at the venue long ago. Wu was simply dressed and had a clear appearance. He felt like a scholar rather than a high official. Elder Qian Xuesen did not arrive. It was said that he was ill. Qian had been reviewing new physics terms with Qiu Weiyu, Zhou Changshou, and others at Jiaotong University for eleven consecutive days, returning late every day. There was no car to send him home. The elderly could not withstand excessive hardship, which led to a cold and the loss of three days and six meals of good flavor, which could not help but make people complain. Chen Zongqi, a geomagnetism expert, often carried a large leather bag. It was unknown what treasures were hidden inside. Wang Fushan, a disciple of Heisenberg and a quantum mechanics expert in China, waited quietly for the meeting to begin with great wisdom. Liu Xian, an anthropologist, and Lu Zidao, a neurologist, also attended as participants.</p>
<p>When President Zang Bentong delivered his opening remarks, he said that centimeters and millimeters should never coexist, and the word "yi" should never be used to refer to ten thousand times ten thousand. His words reminded the fool of the debate between counting and mathematics, the debate between metaphysics and science, and even more of the other double-dealing cases in the country. The world is determined by "one," but it is really difficult, very difficult to achieve this "one." Wu Xuezhou, a chemical expert, appeared on the stage as a representative of the Ministry of Education. From a comparison of the development history of Eastern and Western thought, he predicted that Chinese physics, and even all of science, should have a day of flourishing. Ren Hongjun, who has devoted himself to promoting science in China for more than 20 years, took the stage as a representative of the Science Society, believing that it was urgent to repair the wounds of China's physics research institutions. It is hoped that these wounds will be repaired quickly so that science can recover its health and move forward as soon as possible, and not end up with new wounds being added before the old ones have healed.</p>
<p>Wu Youxun's speech was almost entirely delivered from a biased perspective, and his tone was sometimes high and sometimes low, and his words were sometimes humorous and sometimes solemn, which indeed impressed the author. He believed that the "advancement" and "popularization" of physics should be promoted simultaneously; he wanted us to "appreciate and encourage each other"; and he put forward the slogans of "rigor" and "not deceiving people." Academic research should certainly not "deceive people," and it also "cannot deceive people." The rumor that Zhou Moumou had won the Nobel Prize was ultimately an unflattering thing for the Chinese people. In fact, in terms of "popularization," there should also be a spirit of "not deceiving people" and creation. Suppose a Chinese popular science magazine insists on printing an English name Scientific China on the cover, and most of the content is not Chinese, this seems to be close to deceiving people and has a suspicion of plundering the beauty. Suppose there is another Chinese popular science magazine that almost entirely reprints works from foreign books and newspapers. The owners of those works write letters to the Chinese editors, requesting royalties for the reprints in very tactful terms. The editor actually comes up with a mistranslation that makes no sense, and publishes it together with the original letter, saying that he hopes they will publish a Chinese version. This is simply worse than deceiving people. If this habit of "deceiving people" is exposed, how can we uphold the words of "not deceiving people" in the future? Wu also told a very interesting story with overtones, saying that more than 20 years ago, Langmuir came to China for the first time and looked down on everyone. Later, he saw that China actually had X-ray equipment and even Wilson cloud chambers, and only then did he go from being arrogant to respectful. This story reminded the author of what Liu Xian said at the symposium of seven scientific groups, that we should wait until China has atomic energy research before expressing our opinions on atomic energy to the world.</p>
<p>When reading the papers, Ding Xushi performed several demonstration teaching instruments with a humorous attitude, which brought a lot of laughter. The important papers included Lu Xueshan's "Preliminary Report on Uranium Oxide Crystals," Shi Ruwei's "Influence of Magnetic Coercivity on Coercive Force," and Chen Zongqi's "Geomagnetism in Southeastern China," all of which were the result of careful research in China. There was also Shu Xingbei's "Force - A Fictitious Concept," but because the author did not come, he asked someone to read it on his behalf, which was inevitably a bit unsatisfactory. It is said that Lu's research also exists in the American Manhattan Project, but it is still being kept secret.</p>
<p>The Air Force performed radar, and was given the privilege of previewing it. When an airplane passed dozens of miles away, the green fluorescent line on the screen fluctuated. A point immediately appeared on the white fluorescent line, and the direction and distance were immediately known. The whole machine is only like a bookcase in size, but the theories and skills in it cannot be exhausted by a cabinet, nor can they be achieved overnight.</p>
<p>During the symposium, someone said that the teaching materials used in a certain middle school in Shanghai were all university physics, which seemed too deep. Someone said that the test questions for recruiting new students at a certain university were unknown whether they were testing middle school students or university students. These words won applause from the whole hall. Ding Xubao came up with new and strange things again and performed them. It seemed that someone heard someone say that there was nothing special about it, but the author strongly disagreed. How could one not admire Ding's creative spirit and his good intentions in education? It should be known that inventing the atomic bomb and the theory of relativity are certainly amazing things, but making the ignorant public understand the basic knowledge of physics is probably not an easy task.</p>

<h3>Cold Light</h3>
<p>— Qing Yin</p>
<p>Physics tells us that when an object is heated to a certain degree, it will emit light. Light and heat are always linked together. In the sky, the sun is the most common heating and luminous object. Many of the stars at night are hotter and larger than the sun, but because they are too far from the earth, we can only detect faint light and measure extremely small amounts of heat. For this reason, when we encounter light, we always associate it with the existence of heat. The two are simply like a pair of close brothers who are difficult to separate.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to so-called "cold light," we cannot help but separate this pair of close brothers. Originally, "cold light" is not related to "heat."</p>
<p>Although cold light is not made from heat, its function is still the same as ordinary light generated by heat. It can make various substances produce adjacent light and fluorescence, can make photographic film sensitive to light, plant seedlings can bend in its direction, and can also make leaves produce chlorophyll.</p>
<p>The source of this cold light is almost all in living things. Dried fish and dead animal meat often emit light at night. This is caused by a kind of bacteria. There are 30 kinds of these bacteria, the most common of which is called Bacterium Phosphoreum, which lives on fish and meat. Light emission is a side effect of its activity. Near the ocean, one can often see dead fish emitting a grass-green glow in the early stages of decay at night. This is also due to this bacteria.</p>
<p>In deep caves, there is also often luminous moss. The reason for this moss is that a kind of lens-shaped cell on its epidermis reflects sunlight. The reason why cat eyes can glow in the dark is also because there is a very developed mirror-like layer on the back of their eyes that reflects light.</p>
<p>Among luminous animals, the most numerous are fish and shrimp in the sea. Many parts of them emit light, mostly near the abdomen, such as sea pens, starfish, and brittle stars. There is a kind called the luminous anchovy, whose light can even be used to read newspapers. Some seas often contain countless noctiluca, which are single-celled small animals that can emit light when stimulated. Therefore, often when sea ships pass by or people walk on the beach that has just receded, they leave a golden trail of light.</p>
<p>There are many other animals that can emit light: in South America, there is a kind of beetle called the automobile worm, which emits white light in the front and red light in the back; in New Zealand, there is a large cave whose walls and ceiling are full of thousands of fireflies, illuminating the entire cave; in Sumatra, there is a kind of firefly with twenty-eight luminous spots, which is famous for its light emission. In addition, countless kinds of jellyfish, sponges, sea worms, earthworms, ophiuroids, mollusks, shrimp, crabs, squid, and anglerfish can also emit light.</p>
<h3>Are Mutations Chemical Changes? (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hao Tianhe</p>
<p>On the other hand, the corrective efficiency of mustard gas is sometimes no lower than that of X-rays. Slizynska and Slizynski used various methods for cytological research to produce sex-linked lethal factors, and found that in 20% of the cases, only one lethal factor was produced. This kind of hereditary change is caused by minor defects on the chromosomes. Moreover, the occurrence rate of this factor is the same whether it is irradiated by X-rays or ultraviolet rays, or treated with mustard gas. Although some factors have truly mutated, others have undergone slight reorganization of the chromosomes. Geneticists focus on this common point, which is why the same occurrence rate occurs without any difference. Perhaps it is because there is no significant difference between gene mutation and chromosome reorganization, because that kind of reorganization is extremely slight and cannot be detected by cytological methods. It is worth noting whether small defects on chromosomes are the cause of the same proportion of lethal factors. That kind of lethal factor can sometimes be produced by chemical drugs that are weaker than mustard gas.</p>
<p>There is also a second difference between the physical and chemical effects of X-rays and mustard gas. After chemical drug treatment, a visible mutation was found, but this study was a bit of a failure. This is because the mutations observed in the research process were of the same type as those obtained after X-ray irradiation. Moreover, this gas did not show any special effect on the individual factors. Therefore, there seems to be no difference between the radiation of mustard gas and X-rays. However, there is indeed a difference between these two forces, not in the type of mutation produced, but in the different trends shown by the mutations in the offspring of the treated fruit flies. After male fruit flies are treated with X-rays, abnormalities occur in most of the offspring, such as yellow body color, replacing the normal gray-white color, covering the entire surface of their bodies. Only a small part (less than 15%) of the mutated individuals belong to the mosaic type, that is, the color of a part of the body shows abnormalities, while other parts are still normal. On the contrary, after male fruit flies are treated with mustard gas, the proportion of mosaic offspring is higher (usually between 30% and 50%). Moreover, the gonads of mosaic fruit flies caused by X-rays rarely contain both normal and mutated cells, while mosaic fruit flies caused by mustard gas usually produce these two types of cells. Special studies have been done on this mosaic gonad, focusing specifically on the mutation of sex-linked lethal factors. If a female fruit fly (whose ovary produced by a treated male fruit fly contains cells carrying a sex-linked lethal factor in some tissues), the males produced in the future are often fewer than normal female fruit flies. The degree of male deficiency depends on the ratio of the normal part to the mutated part in the ovary. If a female fruit fly has a sex-linked "semi-lethal" mutation factor evenly distributed in all the cells of the ovary, this mutation will inevitably reduce the production of males. Therefore, only a part of the male offspring can fully develop, and the sex ratio in her offspring will also be reduced accordingly. The reason is that this female fruit fly is the daughter of a male fruit fly that has been wrongly radiated, and the low sex ratio in her offspring is almost entirely due to the semi-lethal mutation factor affecting the entire ovary. On the other hand, if male fruit flies are treated with mustard gas, nine out of every twenty daughters produced will lack males in the future. This is because in their abnormal ovaries, some mosaic cells carry a sex-linked lethal factor. Finally, it is also necessary to mention a very significant example of mosaicism, a male fruit fly born to a male fruit fly treated with mustard gas, whether in their gonads or body cells, are all mosaic cells. Assuming that after the factors in the sperm cells are affected by the treatment, although they do not mutate immediately, they can obtain a tendency to mutate, and this tendency can be latent until the cells divide later, this assumption has also been supported by facts. Because in several cases, it has been found that the offspring produced by fruit flies with mosaic gonads still have the same mosaic gonads. In this example, a certain unstable mutation characteristic caused by external forces can be seen. After becoming stable, it seems that it can also be passed from this generation to the next. There is no similar parallel observation report in radiation genetics. However, this so-called unstable factor seems to be worth noting. This factor has been found several times in untreated materials and has a tendency to continue to mutate in the same direction.</p>

<h3>On the Tragic Protagonist</h3>
<p>— Chen Shouzhu</p>
<p>Aristotle gave a detailed explanation of the protagonist in tragedy in Chapter 13 of "Poetics." This is one of the most important issues in Aristotle's drama theory. The original text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>"All perfect tragedies must arrange complex structures and should not arrange simple structures, as has been explained in the previous article. Furthermore, tragedies should express actions that can arouse pity and terror, because this is the characteristic of tragedy. Based on this inference, the first point is that the change in fate written in the tragedy should not express the scene of good people falling into misfortune from good fortune; because this neither makes people pity nor terrifies people, it only amazes us. The second point is that it should not express the scene of bad people turning from misfortune to good fortune, because this is the most inconsistent with the spirit of tragedy. There is no tragic nature in it, and it is not enough to satisfy moral consciousness, nor is it enough to arouse pity or terror. Third, it is also not suitable to include in the play the fact that extremely evil people eventually get evil results. This kind of structure can indeed satisfy moral consciousness, but it is also not enough to arouse pity and terror; because innocent suffering can arouse our pity, and only people similar to us encountering misfortune can arouse our terror. Therefore, evil people getting evil retribution is neither pitiful nor terrifying. In other words, the most suitable character for tragedy is one who is between these two extremes—the person is not extremely good and upright, and his misfortune is not caused by evil deeds or bad behavior, but by some kind of mistake or shortcoming. Therefore, the person must be famous and respected, with a prominent position and influence, such as Oedipus, Themistocles, or other members of prominent families."</p>
<p>Aristotle's intention is that the tragic protagonist must be between all good and all evil, with errors or shortcomings that are unavoidable for people, so that a tragic effect can be achieved. Tragedy is a kind of conflict, a kind of suffering; if a perfect person has almost no conflict, even if he suffers because of conflict, he will definitely remain calm and composed, as if he has never suffered. Gods will not suffer, and saints regard suffering as happiness; therefore, we do not believe that gods will truly produce tragedy, and the tragedy of saints is beyond our sympathy. Although we admire gods and worship saints, we are ultimately not gods or saints. They are above us, and we do not truly love them or truly hate them, so we do not have the most profound sympathy for them. We sympathize with people like us, who have humanity and are close to human feelings. We truly love them and truly hate them, so we have the most intense interest. Therefore, only their tragedy can move us.</p>
<p>Since tragedy takes an imperfect ending as the orthodox, it is natural that neither good people getting good retribution nor evil people getting good retribution is sufficient to constitute a tragedy. As for evil people getting evil retribution, although it conforms to "poetic justice," it is also insufficient to produce a tragic result. Whether tragedy is to make people get catharsis or to be moved, it is definitely not to persuade people to do good and cultivate moral concepts; and the evil retribution of evil people has no meaning other than making people applaud and cheer.</p>
<p>The German playwright Schiller is said not to have read "Poetics," but his views on the tragic protagonist are the same as those of Aristotle. Schiller once said in his "On Tragic Art" (Ueber die Tiagische Kunst): "Tragedy imitates actions, and this action allows us to see a person suffering. The word 'person' is enough to mark the scope of tragedy. Only when people like us suffer can we arouse our pity. Therefore, evil ghosts and gods, or even morally depraved people like them, and flawless spirits, are not suitable for tragedy. Suffering means the suffering of a complete person. Spirits have no reason to suffer, and people who are close to spirits cannot arouse our deep sympathy. An evil person will certainly encounter terrible suffering; but if a person has no moral consciousness, he is just a puppet of suffering, and any scene of suffering that is not related to reason is enough to make people disgusted. Therefore, the tragedian prefers to portray complex characters, and it is very insightful to make the ideal tragic protagonist between all evil and all good."</p>
<p>In Greek tragedy, we can find three tragedies to study Aristotle's theory. The tragic protagonist's misfortune is caused by mistakes that are unknowingly committed or knowingly committed, or unwarranted mistakes. The tragic cause of "Oedipus Rex" is due to Oedipus Rex's patricide and marriage to his mother. However, this kind of mistake is caused by fate, and the protagonist was unable to foresee it, so it evolved into a tragedy. This kind of tragedy is purely a product of Greek religion. According to modern concepts, anyone who unintentionally makes a big mistake cannot be held responsible. Therefore, this example is rare in modern tragedy. The play "Medea" is a good example of a knowingly committed mistake. Medea deliberately retaliates, carefully considers and gradually realizes her poisonous plan. She knows what kind of results will be produced. Although there is no lack of contradiction in her heart, her poisonous plan is finally realized. Regarding the play "Antigone," although Hegel believes that the protagonist is too biased, if we think carefully, who can admit that she really has a mistake? She violates national law for the sake of friendship, who says she shouldn't? Therefore, Antigone encountered misfortune, and she herself cannot be held responsible.</p>
<p>This third example, that is, the protagonist suffers innocently, is obviously contrary to Aristotle's saying that the tragic protagonist must have errors or weaknesses that are unavoidable for people. And most modern social tragedies belong to this example. Under the unreasonable social system of modern times, ordinary good people, who can be said to have no defects in themselves, suffer all kinds of unreasonable oppression and harm in vain, and even die. Tragedy aims to express life, and human life is always changing, so the basic spirit of tragedy and comedy is the same in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Regarding the identity or status of the tragic protagonist, Aristotle believes that "they must be of high status, famous, and influential." This kind of view is only enough to explain ancient tragedies; it may not be true for modern tragedies. In the era of theocracy and monarchy in Europe, gods, emperors, and heroines occupied an important position in the minds of ordinary people. Therefore, not only Greek tragedies, but also Shakespearean tragedies, the protagonists are all of high status, famous, and influential. But since the prevalence of democratic politics in the eighteenth century and the rise of family tragedies, the middle class and even the proletariat have acquired a legitimate position in tragedy. Modern audiences go to the theater to see their own lives expressed on the stage, and they are not as interested in the gods, emperors, and heroines in ancient plays as ancient audiences were. The love and hate of ordinary people, the material life and even the spiritual life, are excellent themes in modern plays. Therefore, our requirements for the tragic protagonist are not in the superiority or inferiority of their identity or status, but in their noble character and strong perseverance.</p>
<p>Regarding character, there is another regulation in Chapter 15 of "Poetics":</p>
<p>"Regarding character, there are four things to pay attention to. First, character must be good, this point is the most important. All languages or actions that show any moral purpose are enough to express the character of the person; if this moral purpose is good, the character must also be good. This rule applies to every type of person. Because women are inferior to men, and slaves are humble and insignificant, women or slaves are not without goodness. Second, when describing character, strive to be appropriate. Perseverance and bravery are the spirit of a man. It is not appropriate to say that a woman is brave, or clever and reckless. Third, character must strive to be real, and what is consistent with life is called real. It cannot be confused with goodness and propriety. Fourth, when describing character, strive to be consistent; because although the character of a certain person is inconsistent, there must be consistency in its inconsistency."</p>
<p>The goodness Aristotle speaks of here refers to character, not perfection, as mentioned above that a perfect person is not suitable for tragedy. However, modern people's views on whether a character must be good are somewhat different from those of Aristotle. For the sake of realism, Euripides included many base characters in his tragedies, such as Jason in "Medea" and Menelaus in "Orestes." In English Elizabethan tragedies, there are even more villains. From this, it can be seen that the characters in tragedy do not have to be good. What we require of the characters in the play is not whether their character is good, but whether they do have a special character, which is obvious and profound.</p>
<p>Regarding the point that the description of character must strive to be appropriate, our views are also not entirely the same as those of Aristotle. So-called propriety means being consistent with the type or being consistent with the general nature (True to Type). Ancient writers often divided people into several types, and deeply studied their common characteristics to distinguish them. The general nature of each type of person is different, so when describing the character of a certain type of person, it must be between the general nature of a certain type of person. Greek tragedies are based on myths and legends, and the characters in them are stereotyped. Therefore, tragic poets must strive to conform to the character of the type before they can be trusted. The Greek philosopher Theophrastus wrote thirty-six "Characters," vividly depicting the general nature of thirty-six types of people. He had a great influence on the writers of the time, and the Greek comedian Menander, who founded European comedy of manners, was deeply influenced by him. From Menander's surviving fragments and the comedies of Terence and Plautus, who imitated him, we can always encounter昏庸老朽的父親,荒唐熱的兒子,以及智足多謀的僕人. These characters are all typical characters, with obvious general natures and lacking special personalities. Although describing the general nature of characters is convenient for identification, its biggest shortcoming is that the characters are mostly the same, and the typical characters become clichéd characters (Stock Character), which often makes readers and audiences bored. Because human life is becoming more and more complex, the influence of the social environment on human beings is also becoming stronger and stronger, and the research on human nature is becoming more refined and profound. Therefore, in modern drama, not only is character more important than plot, but also in the description of character, individuality is more important than general nature. Although Aristotle advocated that the character of a person must conform to the type, he criticized modern drama with the four words "conform to the type," and his meaning was more derogatory than commendatory. If we stick to Aristotle's theory and insist on typical character, we will make the same mistake as Thomas Rymer, the master of English neoclassicism. Rymer believes that the character of Iago in "Othello" cannot be established. Why? Because in Rymer's view, it is a universally accepted fact that soldiers are honest and repay kindness with kindness. The value of an artist lies in being unique everywhere, expressing what others have not expressed, and avoiding following others blindly. The modern Irish literary giant Yeats once said in his "Plays and Controversties": "All art is based on personal fantasy, and the greater the art, the more personal the fantasy; all clumsy art is based on impersonal types and images. Ordinary men and women, because they lack imagination, do not dare to travel in fantasy, or because they only know hard work and have no talent, so they accept that impersonal type and image." The so-called impersonal is generalization, and the personal is originality. The spirit of science lies in generalization, and the spirit of art lies in originality.</p>
<p>Although modern people's views are slightly different from those of Aristotle, this is not enough to reduce Aristotle's value. As Dryden said: "To say that Aristotle would say so is not enough to be a conclusion, because Aristotle's basis is only the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides; if he were born today and could see the works of modern people, he might change his tone." Literature and art evolve with human life, and the past and present are different. If we stick to his theory without adding supplements and inventions, we will be violating his critical spirit.</p>
<h3>Touching Fish Tune - Autumn Sound (Using Jiaxuan's Rhyme)</h3>
<p>— Gu Yiqiao</p>
<p>Who is worried about the misty rain in a building, and the swallows flying away from the reef? The Qinhuai River is green, and Zhongshan is purple, with countless frost leaves and building clouds; autumn doesn't stop. Mourning the rouge at the bottom of the well, the lonely road of Taicheng, the rivers and mountains are silent, asking about the falling flowers, the opening flowers, the withered flowers, the good flowers, neither fog nor catkins. Board game is needed, but the lives of the people are completely mistaken. How many times have the winds and moons envied each other; do the winds know the changing phases of the moon? Who can tell the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion? Wind, don't dance, I'm afraid that the fallen leaves will be swept away by the wind to the central plains. The rise and fall of dynasties are the most bitter, let's hold the dangerous railings together, the autumn sound surrounds us, let's go to a higher place.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Fortunately, after arriving at Changping, I used a golden cicada shedding its shell to slip away for most of the night. I also luckily encountered engineer Mr. Wu. Immediately afterwards, Brother Hu also found me. Brother Hu then discovered the large group of comrades outside the pass (I don't know how they ended up here). Only then did I regain my full freedom.</p>
<p>"I only explained these few things, so you can imagine how difficult it was for me to meet Brother Hu in Tianjin. It's better to say it's impossible than difficult... truly impossible! I remember that after I came out of the Japanese "Action Command," I immediately tried to make a phone call to the hotel. The old receptionist told me that "Brother Chu had already been there, and the note and one hundred yuan bill left behind had already been given to Brother Hu." This was the only direct news I received about Brother Hu in Tianjin, and I was almost discovered by Maisaf...</p>
<p>Yaoqun continued his narration:</p>
<p>"That very night, Maisaf told me personally, as if reporting some special news, that "a monster" had appeared in Tianjin! When I saw the spirit in which he spoke, I determined that the word "monster" referred to Brother Hu. Here is a section of our conversation at the time:</p>
<p>"What monster?" — I asked.</p>
<p>"A monster who kills people!" — Maisaf answered.</p>
<p>"Kills people?" — I asked.</p>
<p>"That's right... and doesn't use weapons!" — Mai answered.</p>
<p>"How do you mean?" — I asked.</p>
<p>"Doesn't use a gun, and doesn't use a knife. Don't you think that's special?" — Mai answered.</p>
<p>"Then, how can he kill people?" — Actually, I had already understood that it was Brother Hu's doing, but I still pretended to be surprised and asked.</p>
<p>"It's very special!" — Mai said.</p>
<p>"But does he kill people with poison?" — I pretended not to understand and asked him.</p>
<p>"Don't pretend to be stupid. Maybe this trick can fool the Japanese, but you and I have both practiced a little Chinese martial arts. How could we not know?" — Mai squeezed me coldly.</p>
<p>"Practiced martial arts? Doesn't that just mean killing people with fists?" — I still didn't change my attitude.</p>
<p>"Hmm, pretty close!" — Maisaf said in a strange tone, as if saying that I shouldn't pretend.</p>
<p>"How many people did he kill; who were they?" — Because I wanted to understand why Brother Hu had to do that, I wanted to find out from Mai Saf, so I asked him this.</p>
<p>"I heard that two Japanese secret agents, two guards, died; you know, the guards who watch the prison, and also a few Chinese police officers - probably this guy thought his partner had disappeared, thought he was arrested, so he did this so ruthlessly" -</p>
<p>Haha, not bad results, I intentionally said, what do you think Mai Saf.</p>
