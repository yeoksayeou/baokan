<h3>和約草案審議就緒　我國對日仍主寬大　對琉球主權我闡明態度</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕外部關於對日和約之準備工作，自抗戰末期開始以來，經數年之愼重精密處理，業已大部完成。所有各項問題，經該部負責官員曁對日和約審議委會多次集議及全國專家·學者書面提出意見，已各於充分考慮後，獲得答案，全部工作於今瀕臨結束，唯審議委會仍繼續存在，以備隨時集議諮詢。據權威人士語本報記者，此項任務之圓滿達成，厥功殊大，此草約內容囊括一切重要問題，非唯代表我國對於和議條件之意見，且係基於保障世界和平，懲兇除恨之人類原則，以解決問題，將來召開對日和會時，可提出以爲最合理之討論根據。據記者獲悉：對日和約審議委會參加工作之結果，已使若干問題經愼重考慮而有所變更，領土條款中已確定我對琉球羣島之要求。此已經張羣院長在上月提出參政會報吿。此外，日本南洋各島，則以託管爲宜。政治條款中，關於根除其侵略精神之種種敎育措施與思想改造之主張，業經一致確認，並規定自其社會組織中消滅　武傳統現任天皇之身份，其與戰爭之關係，必依事實法理加以估定。其未來元首之職責稱謂，亦須重新考慮。賠償條款部份，其保留工業之水準，巳採年限根據，可能係一九三○年後三年中之標準，唯保留工業之類別，我國不擬讓步。凡直接間接可作軍事生產應用之工業，必予拆除。我國要求賠償之百分比，仍不得少於百分之四十八。在國外佔領區以强力迫使當地人民流血出汗，而爲鞏固佔領加强侵略所爲之「建設」及一切含有侵略性之貸款，均不能認係其海外資產，而須視爲各該地區人民之財富。</p>
<h3>蘇自東北所獲設備　應在賠償品中扣除</h3>
<p>至蘇聯自我東北移去之資產及工業設備，則不能視爲獲自日本之「戰利品」，須自其應得之日本賠償額中扣除若干，以爲公正之補償。至於軍事條款，仍堅持解除其全部武裝，並限制以後有超過維持國內秩序治安之任何發展。此外，和約簽訂後之履行問題，我國仍主張必須有所中證。軍事佔領，由於事實上或有困難，可從長討議，民政監督則萬不可廢。總括言之，我國最後決定並擬提出對日和會之和約草案，在若干方面可能較原先預計者放寬。此爲大多數專家就事實考慮之結果，而王外長訪日所得之印象，亦具重要分量、王氏歸國後，曾公開宣稱：片山及其內閣，確有領導日本步上民主和平之願望，且已有所表現。王氏亦同情日本人民之一般困苦。權威人士並再强調，我對於處理日本問題，決無報復心理作用，祗求其痛改前非，對遠東及世界有所貢獻。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕關於我對日和會準備會議之建議，英國繼蘇聯之後，亦予拒絕後，首都方面頗感遺憾。按：我國之建議乃係兼容蘇聯及英·美歧視中之主要部份，以求博成雙方之妥協，乃竟遭雙方先後之拒絕，不免有維谷之感。惟中國亟盼對日和會早日召開之意願絕未放棄，且因之更爲熱切，蓋對日和約草案之準備，業瀕最後決定階段，而於法律上終止戰爭之時期，亦不容更事拖延。據官方人士稱：美國對我建議，尙無覆文，唯對我國是否將俟美方有所決定或立即爭取美國之合作，以爲打開僵局之最後努力，則不加評論。</p>
<h3>白宮舉行會議　檢討援外計劃　四年需一六五億美元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十五日廣播：華盛頓訊，杜魯門總統今日與國會兩黨領袖晤談十八分鐘。事後共和黨參議員范登堡稱：總統希望於星期五國會特會休會前提出馬歇爾援歐長期計劃。　並謂：渠曾詢問兩黨領袖有關國會特會休會之時間問題，彼等吿以兩院均希望於星期五休會。范氏並未透露總統之咨文究將於何時提出。杜魯門亦未透露之咨文內容，諒以會晤時間過份匆促之故。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕杜魯門總統十五日邀請國會議員領袖至白宮檢討政府援助西歐復興之長期計劃，四年內共需美金一百六十五億，被邀諸人與總統全盤討論國外情形後，即　返議會，將由參議院採取迅速行動，通過對法。茲·奧·中四國之五億九千七百萬元臨時援助案。據參院外委會主席范登堡稱：此項緊急援助法案，係代表參衆兩院多令救濟方案之折衷辦法，即日當可由兩院通過，送交總統簽署。但傳聞衆院撥款委員會或建議减削五千萬元至一萬萬元以上。關於馬歇爾之長期救濟計劃，總統似砍先知共和、民主兩黨領袖之意見，並堅決主張淸國會議員先行通過一四年計劃，其每年撥款數目，可聽由國會決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕據悉：衆院撥款委員會有力小組，現仍擬削减援外法案所規定五億九千七百萬元之數，中國部份亦有被删除之慮。目下聞已商定草案，規定：　中國部份不列入緊急救濟法案，　對法·義·奧三國救濟費削减五千萬至六千萬元。尙待磋商者，即中國部份旣經刪除，則原擬資助該國之六千萬元是否亦隨之刪除。撥款委員會小組討論此事嚴守秘密，定十五日繼續會議，一俟商定成案，即提付撥款委員會全體會議審核，惟該小組與撥款委員會主席均屬共和黨議員泰波，小組所決定者，撥款委員會全體會議自必予以核准。</p>
<h3>郭德華今飛香港　議續交涉九龍城事件</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕外交部兩廣特派員郭德華，爲九龍城事件晋京請示後來滬，定今晨乘機飛港，將與香港當局就九龍城事件繼續交涉。</p>
<h3>陳啟天返京　暢談赴濟感想</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕經濟部長陳啓天，十五日由濟乘車返京，與記者于車次談述其赴濟感想。陳氏稱：本人此次赴濟，係應邀參加浦濟通車典禮，兼視察津浦沿綫煤產煤運及濟南工商情况，濟南為孤城，與四面斷絕交通甚久，賴山東軍政當局與人民共同苦撑至今，實爲難得。本人在濟，曾與山東軍政當局及工商界領袖晤談多次，幷視察電廠，紗廠及麵粉廠多家，深覺各方多能切實苦幹，至可欽佩，惟欲永保濟南，必須從速恢復山東全省，欲從速恢復山東全省，除必須有足够防剿之國軍外，尚須擴充地方保安部隊，山東人民之性格，最適合於軍隊要求，如由山東人民組成之部隊加多，不惟有益於山東一省，而且有益於全國也。（下接二版一欄）</p>
<h3>平黨政軍各界　歡迎傅作義　傅氏强調軍政配合</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕傳作義今日在北平各界歡迎會上演說，强調軍政配合，實行民生主義，必須克復目前難局。歡迎會係藉市黨部擴大紀念週之便舉行，李宗仁主持，在平各黨政軍首長皆參加，李宗仁首致詞稱：渠相信傅氏必能以其克苦奮鬥作風，完成華北五省剿匪重任。繼之，傳氏於掌聲雷動中步上講台。傅氏謂局勢雖嚴軍而經多方分析，深信共匪終必失敗，當舉五點以證明此種結論：　因民主憲政之實施，有助於戡亂；　過去認爲可和平解決共匪問題之人士，今已覺悟從而助政府戡亂；　政府和平自由區人民已飽嘗共匪所招致之戰禍，吾人應實施民生主義，改革政治，以解教人民；　共匪統治人民，全賴恐怖政策，種仇已深，人民必將因國軍之救援起而反抗；　歡日來之視察，知道各部隊應付共匪之戰術，戰略，軍風紀已改進。最後傅氏稱：今日局面，僅軍隊不能解決問題，必須軍政配合，軍事掩護政治，政治掩護經濟方克有成，過去爲作官而入黨之現象亦將不再見於今日。</p>

<h3>慶祝招商局七十五周年</h3>
<p>國營招商局以今日爲其創立七十五周年，本報與該局有同年之雅，逢此盛典，不能無一辭以爲祝賀。過去的七十五年，確是中國歷史上一個非常重要的時期。由於淸廷的昏庸，列强對華的侵略步步加緊，終至欲閉關自守都不可能，於是門戶大開，甚至到了瓜分的邊綠。由於與列强的接觸，此在政治上，激盪而成國民革命的高潮，賴先烈的前仆後繼，卒能顚覆淸室，建立民國。於是又引起日本軍閥的侵略，終至全面抗戰，和抗戰的勝利結束，在經濟文化方面，我們漸知不能墨守陳法，必須向西方學習堅甲利兵，提倡科學，一面致力於本國重工業及近代交通事業的建立。同時又須啟發民智，使民衆一般的知識水準得以提高。如此雙方並進，中國方能躋於近代富强國家之林。申報和招商局都在此項的感召之下而創立。本報的七十五周年之慶，過去還不久，如今又逢招商局創立七十五周年，誼切「同年」，我們願於此，首致祝賀。</p>
<p>就招商局的歷史來說，過去的七十五年，誠不能不使我們感觸多端。招商局的創立與日本郵船會社的創立同時。在戰前日本郵船會社有輪舶一百五十餘艘，其總噸數達一百餘萬噸，航綫遍全球，已列爲世界一等的航運機構；而我們的招商局，抱殘守闕，旣沒有什麼新的發展，就是創業時的那一番勇氣和雄心，也已消沉，十足變成一副破落戶的樣子。中國人民看見了當時招商局和日本郵船會社的對照，誰也不禁晞噓太息。然而造成招商局不振的，原因本也並不單純。不平等條約的存在，竟運中國領水內的航運都爲列强所控制，這對於招商局的發展，當然是一個致命的打擊。人謀的不臧，自然也不可辭咎。積此多種原因，招商局的發展，於是處處遭頓挫。今日我們來慶祝招商局的七十五周年，有幾點我們似乎不能不首先加以提出：　在抗戰期中及勝利來臨之後，招商局以其有限的船隻，致力於軍運及復員的工作，可以說對國家民族曾盡了它最大的努力；　自徐學禹氏接任招商局以來，銳意整頓經營，不特舊欠淸債，抑且添置新船，致力於遠洋航綫的擴展，頓使招商局遭逢了新生。茲當招商局七十五周年的今日，正該局遭逢新生之時，我們懍於慘痛的過去，展望將來，更願再進數言：</p>
<p>第一，招商局以國營的航運機關，目前所擁有的噸位還很低，不特沒有戰前日本郵船會社的一百餘萬噸，卽離其半數五十餘萬噸還有相當的距離：我們的航運業也實在離開我們的理想還很遠很遠。如今日本戰敗，它從前在東方乃至世界航運界所有的地位，應該讓給我國。然而以我國現有的商船噸位，實在還不能担仟這一種使命。爲今之計，政府應迅向有關方面提出，至少以日本現有商船總噸數的三分之一，讓予中國，作爲部份的賠償。中國對德義也是交戰國，德義的一部商船，亦應交予我國。</p>
<p>第二，我們應該積極建立我們的造船工業。我國的造船工業，瓶辦於淸末。當時的馬尾造船廠及江南造船所，都曾享一時盛名，其奈以後就一蹶不振，今日我們的造船工業連原有的一點基礎也不保了。沒有造船工業的建立，則航運業的發展，便有了先天不足的限制。我們在平時固能向國外購得船隻，此不特消耗外滙，一旦發生戰事，可能更受到打聲。我們如果要發展航業，必須建立我們自己的造船工業。造船工業爲重工業，依照三民主義的經濟政策，應歸國營；所以我們願政府能注意及此，及早將我們的造船工業建立起來。</p>
<p>第三，就國防的觀點，商船艦隊爲國防中不可或缺的一部門。不用說，商船艦隊在戰時就能參加海軍勤務，成爲海軍的一部；就是不直接參戰，它所能担任的運輸警衛等勤務，也對於國防直接間接有關。我們如今旣致力於海軍的重建，來保衛我們的海疆，更不可忽略了商船艦隊的建立。向以海軍聞名於世的英國，就以商船艦隊爲它的商海軍（　Merchant　Navy）。我國之能有强大海軍的建立，目前的條件，似猶未够，則如何擴充我們商船艦隊的噸位，政府對於航運業自應予以最大的協助。</p>
<p>末了，就經濟的觀點來論，遠洋航綫的經營，是發展對外貿易的一種重要工具。在今天外匯萬分困難的情形下，自運自銷，益感重要。過去國際收支不能平衡，入超固然是一個主要原因，其中由於運費的支出，數量也頗可驚人。據報傳消息，我國此次以剩餘物資的廢鋼鐵售與美鋼廠，其中一筆運費就須占美金一千八百萬元，可知在國際貿易上，如果沒有自己經營的海外航錢。所耗外滙的數量實在可觀。如今招商局已有遠洋航綫的開闢，我們希望由於將來噸位的增加，招商局更能擴充它的海外航錢，來爭取我們海外的市塲，來協助我國民族經濟的發展。</p>
<h3>陳啓天談赴濟感想</h3>
<p>（上接一版）山東在全國之地位，無論從軍事上，政治上，交通上以及文化上言，均屬重要，中央自應繼續加以注意，目前最要之掌，莫急於加强兵力，肅淸殘匪，以便恢復交通，發展實業，山東礦　，如煤，鐵，金等及農產如棉花，小麥，花生，烟葉等均甚豐富。表式工業亦有相當基礎，但刻下以鐵路交通及礦廠，工廠多被共匪破壞之故，各種產品旣大量减少，即現有少量各種產品，亦不易運至需要之地，例如山東煤礦產量之多，本可供全國之用，而濟南電廠曾因交通阻塞，煤運不濟，致停電數月，欲根本解決濟南用煤問題，必須從速修復膠濟路，使淄博煤，可由鐵路大量運至濟南，目前救濟之法，惟有從臨城，及徐州方面運煤至濟。至關於津浦及膠濟沿綫各礦，目前產煤及存煤狀况，約如下述。淮南區之淮南礦，月產九萬噸，存煤三萬五千噸，賈永區之華東礦，月產六萬噸，存煤三萬噸。上述兩礦，均機器完全，臨　區之中興礦，月產三萬三千噸，存煤四萬二千噸，新萊區之新泰等礦，月產僅一千噸，泰寗區之華縣等礦，月產亦僅一千五百噸，以上三礦機器已完全破壞，目前均以土法開採，淄博區之淄博等礦機器，亦破壞一半，月產二萬噸，存煤二萬五千噸，濰縣區之坊子礦，則機器大部完全，月產一萬噸，章邱區各礦，則已完全破壞，毫無生產。根據上述情况統計，魯省煤產月約十萬八千噸，存煤約一十三萬二千噸，爲預防各地煤荒起見，刻正設法趕運各礦存煤，至京·滬及濟南，除商請路局撥定運煤專車三列，經當運煤至京滬外，計將自臨城南運之中興煤約三萬六千噸，北運者約六千噸，又自徐州北運濟南電廠之華東煤，將有五千噸，所有津浦及膠濟沿綫各　，除淮南，華東及坊子外，幾全被共匪破壞。此種破壞，不惟直接制死礦區以內之人民，且間接困死礦區以外之人民，實在令人痛心。山東共匪之所以能一再破壞擾亂不已者，據云：以有日製槍械自東北渡海源源接齊，庄此吾人可以證明共匪叛亂不僅為國內戰爭，而且具有國際意味，如不從速撲滅，則中國固不易實現和平民主，即整個世界亦難獲得安寗也。</p>

<h3>蘇實施幣制改革　新盧布今起流通以一比十兌換舊幣　統一物價廢止配給制度</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十四日典〕蘇聯業已廢止配給制度，實施幣制改革，新盧布定於十二月十六日起流通。蘇聯內閣會議及共產黨中央委員會頒發之命令有云：蘇聯今已面臨改革幣制以加强盧布之交兌率，及廢止供應配給制度，以擴大貿易之任務。在戰爭時期，軍隊之維持費及軍需工業之　展急遽增加，支出之猛增，需要鉅額幣劵之流通，此種情形，在其他各參戰國莫不盡然，同時供人民消費用之物品，產量亦吿减少，零售物交易額大减，幣制改革意在减輕世界戰爭關於幣券流通之後果，並得有助於工人物質福利之提高。人民國家合作所及國有事業所握之幣劵，除輔幣劵外，將兌換新幣券，且在戰爭期問，德軍及其他侵入者，在暫時佔領之蘇聯領土內，發行大量偽盧布劵，使通貨流通數量更見增加，超過國家經濟所需要者之上，因此貨幣購買力减少。時至今日，實已不得不採取步織以加强蘇聯盧布之價値。雖在戰爭條件之下，蘇政府在戰爭期間，由於糧食及工業品之實施配給制度，故配給物之價格，始終得以維持，惟以國家及合作社消費物品貿易之减少，以及人民對集體農塲生產物耍求之增加，引起市價之增加，竟有超出戰前十五倍者，復有投機份子，國積大量物品，以圖獲取暴利。</p>
<h3>新貨幣兌換標準　勞工方面所受損失輕微　暴利份子將遭嚴重打擊</h3>
<p>蘇內閣之命令，旋宣布新貨幣兌換舊盧布之細則辦法如下：銀行存款在三千盧布以下者，以等値兌換新幣，在三千至一萬盧布問者，以其中之三千盧布等値兌換新幣，餘數以三與二之比折換新幣，在一萬盧布以上者，其中三以等値折換新幣，七千以三與二之比折換新幣，其餘部份，以二與一之比折換新幣。手頭持有之現鈔則以舊幣十盧布兌換新幣一盧布。</p>
<p>合作事業集體農塲持有之貨幣，以舊幣五盧布折換新幣四處布，一九四七年以前，國家所發公債，將以舊幣三處布折合新幣二盧布，改名統一公債。在十二月十五，十六，十七三天，銀行存款停止劃付，命令復宣布，今後商價（自由市價）及現給價（官價）問之區別，將予廢止，以統一全國零售價格，將令商務部依照此次宣布之改革，訂定糧食及工業產品之新價。工業產品價格，平均將較目前商價减低三分之一，命令並指出大多數勞工階級所受之損失，僅短期而輕微，暴利份子所受打擊最重。勞工階級雖有損失，但可因較高商價之廢止及現行麵包及穀物配給價之减低而獲補償，但人民必須負担一部份之重大犧牲，何况此已爲最後一次之犧牲。麵包及穀物價格，將各减低百分之十二及十，啤酒價格將减低百分之十，其他糧食大致將維持現價，酒類價不變，工業產品，將較配給價爲高，惟將較商價减低三分之一，肉，魚，脂肪，糖，菸草，糖果，蕃薯，及其他蔬菜，維持與現下配給價相等之價，牛乳及禽蛋，將另定新價。</p>

<h3>英美人士的觀察　預料蘇將建立盧布集團　以對抗馬歇爾援歐方案</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕此間官員看料蘇聯之改革幣制及廢止配給，可以帮助蘇聯與馬歇爾援歐方案對抗者。預料蘇聯或將設法建立盧布之國際價値，目前盧布雖有名義上的國際價値，但實際上並無盧布之國際交易。迄至目前爲止，蘇聯與他國貿易，悉以對方國家之貸幣折價，從事物之交換，若蘇聯能建立盧布之國際購買價値，則他國對蘇貿易，可以盧布折價，使蘇聯可以擴大對斯坎的那維亞及東隊諸國之貿易。此間官員且料蘇聯且將建立盧布集團以與英鎊區域及美元集團對抗，而便於與馬歇爾方案競爭。蘇聯經濟家料已提出計劃，以黃金爲準備，使盧布成爲金本位之貨幣，以穩定其價値，而與馬歇爾方案對抗。蘇黃金存量據估計價値在八億七千五百萬英鎊至四十二億五千萬英鎊之間。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十五日電〕此問國際觀察家，認爲蘇聯決定重新　訂盧布之價値，乃爲蘇聯將在歐洲爭取權力之預兆。其目的在加强蘇聯國內之經濟，而與未來之馬歇爾計劃搏戰。此間又有謠傳蘇聯或將以盧布放入世界市塲，與美元競爭，根據蘇聯政府之幣制改革案，盧布與美元之比率仍爲五·三與一之比。英國之若干蘇聯問題專家稱：蘇聯之幣制改革，對波羅的海蘇維埃共和國以及其他蘇維埃新領土人民之打擊最爲重大，如此可能加速其獨立農民階級之崩潰。專家等繼續指出，所謂集體農塲在波羅的海諸國，實際上至今仍未成立前彼關之西烏克蘭以及前捷克之喀爾巴阡烏克籣等地，集體農塲亦仍未臻堅强，今幣制之改革，可能促使其長成也。蓋在改革中，損失甚重之中農階級，此後將改取集體形式，以保蹬其財產之安全也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕聯邦準備局茶官員稱：莫斯科電台所廣播之改革幣制命令，實表示蘇聯國內通貨膨脹之嚴重，實較外間觀察家預料者更爲惡化。國務院東歐司副司長史旦文斯，渠指出有一點極爲明顯者，即「蘇聯政府已將其負債一下子减爲三分之一矣。」渠又稱，握有儲蓄者在新命令下，財產竟有减至十分之一損失，實最爲慘重。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十五日電〕紐約各晨報評論蘇聯政府之宣佈改革幣制，廢止配給，認爲蘇聯所遭之經濟困難，與若干資本主義國家之困難相同。紐約時報稱：蘇聯此舉爲對類似資本主義的病症，施用極權制度的補救藥品，就蘇政府之命令觀，可知俄羅斯經三十年之共產主義統治後，謀取利益的人類天性，在蘇聯境內亦已復活。紐約先鋒論壇報評稱：蘇聯經濟之病態，正與資本主義經濟之病態相似。然蘇聯之制度，未始不能渡過此等狀態。</p>
<h3>外長會議昨重開　馬歇爾書面答覆蘇詰責　否認自德取得商業利潤</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦五日電〕此間認爲上週末莫洛托夫曾與克里姆林長談，以決定蘇聯之政策，故今日英美法三國迫切注視莫洛托夫是否將使外長會議由此決裂。西方國家各代表團均問意今日午後之集會，將決定外畏會議之是否能繼續。</p>
<p>今晨馬歇爾曾與其代表團討論任何莫洛托夫可能行動之對策，貝文亦曾與艾德禮首相商討外長會議之危機。馬歇爾最後之決定，當視兩日冷塲後莫洛托夫有否改變其立塲而定。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕參加四强外長會議之美代表團發表聲明，否認在佔領期內已有任何美國金業取得德國之商業財產。此項聲明係於星期六向外長會之秘書處提出，係用以答覆蘇聯之質問者。其聲明有云：美國前已建議禁止外國權益取得德國財產之所有　，並建議由每一佔領國向盟管會報吿關於此點之政策，及在每一佔領區內財產所有權變更之事實報吿。此一建議雖未被接受，但美國仍始終恪遵此一原則。美代表團之聲明復曰，自英美區輸出之物資，均接世界市價出售，其出售所得，未有分文係由佔領强國所取得，悉用以購買德經濟需要之主要物品輸入德國，自本年一月一日至十一月一日爲止，英美佔區輸出總額共達一億六千五百萬元。</p>
<h3>具中間偏左色彩　義閣改組就緖</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十四日電〕義總理加斯貝利今日已完成其政府居中偏左之改組，新閣名單向尼古拉總統提出報吿後，可望於明日宣佈。加斯貝利之新閣中，仍排斥共黨與社會黨左翼之參加，而羅致溫和左派五人入閣。</p>
<h3>英保守黨前輩政治家鮑爾溫爵士逝世曾迫使愛德華八世放棄王位</h3>
<p>〔合衆社　倫敦十四日電〕三度任首揆之英保守黨前輩政治家鮑爾溫侯爵，十四夜在睡眠中溘然長逝。飽氏一九三七年自動放棄首相職務後，即卜居史達波城之故居，以度其暮年，渠因患瘋濕病而半身不遂，並患重聽。</p>
<p>鮑氏小史</p>
<p>鮑爾溫爵士，生於一八六七年，今年剛好入十歲。鮑爾溫從一九○八年當選爲下院議員起，直到一九三七年卸任首相爲止，整整地過了三十年的政治生涯。他是保守黨的前輩，被認爲英國保守主義的典型人物。在兩次世界大戰之間，曾三度出任首揆，對於英國近數十年政治上和財政上的影響頗大。鮑爾溫於四十一歲時，開始爲下院議員，此後代表其還區達廿九年之久。一九二一年加入內閣任財相，一九二三年洛波納內閣崩潰，鮑爾溫出而組閣，此爲第一次出任首相。未幾因保證關稅問題而下台。一九二四年，大選勝利，飽爾溫再度出任苜相，迄一九二四年止。在這期間建設新加坡軍港，斷然對俄絕交，實行政治封鎖政策，都是鮑爾溫所堅決推行的，一九二六年煤礦大罷工，更實現了他所標榜的「實業上的和平和善意」一句話。一九三一年爲了應付財政上的危機，由麥唐納領導組織聯合內閣，得到他的助力不少。一九三五年鮑爾溫三度出任首相。</p>
<p>一九三六年十二月迫使愛德華八世（即溫莎公爵）遜位，旋即自行退休，讓位於張伯倫。常時鮑爾溫曾與康登伯萊大主敎迫愛德華於王位及美人二者，擇一而行。愛德華寗願敝屣尊榮，而與兩度離婚之辛浦遜夫人結婚，成爲不愛江山愛美人之千古佳話。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國營招商局問今日慶祝七十五週年，記者叩詢潘議長公展之感想，潘氏謂：招商局與日本郵船會社，幾乎同時成立，但戰前兩者規模相差甚遠，日輪航綫遍及全球，而招商局航綫不出本國江海範圍，吾人實深慚悚。淸季大員能如李鴻章之肯爲維護航業挽回利權着想者甚少，而招商局歷屆主持人物，能如盛宣懷之收買旗昌洋行全部產業之勇氣與魄力者亦不多觀，此爲內在的致命傷。現幸招商局因抗戰勝利而得解放，可望得復興。該局在抗戰期中的復員準備，與勝利後所成就的復員工作，更値得稱道。六艘在川江幸逃刧運之江輪，竟能克服困難，全部修復，即以用作軍公復員之運輸，收效之宏，實非其他交通機關所能企及。此其一。抗戰前夕，招商局產業抵押殆盡，八年血戰，積欠更鉅，而尤以外商銀行之債款爲最多。勝利以後，在財力正感竭蹶之時，毅然以償還價款爲急務，經年餘之折衝，竟能全部淸償，所有抵質在外的契據，亦經全數收回，從此該局基礎益固，乃得一意發展其航運業務。其解決之痛快，又非一般銀行對於存欠涉訟不決者所可幾及。此其二。復興以後適値國家多故，共匪作　，　路公路到處破壞，水上軍公運輸，因之更加頻繁，招商局戰查所在，獨在艱巨，今天靑島仍得保全，烟台得以收復，整個東北尙未全陷匪手，不可謂非該局軍運迅速之勒。假使航權至今尚未收復，外商船隻不能徵用，恐共匪之猖獗，將更不堪設想。此其三。招商局雖是國營，却能與民營航業和衷共濟，精誠合作，權利義務，毫無軒輊，以視其他國營事業，非與民爭利，便互相傾軋，以致在往兩敗俱傷者，不可同日而語。此其四。即此四者，巳可爲招商局夀。吾人當更希望該局於慶祝其七十五周年紀念之後，奮其老當益壯的精神，致力於社會大衆的服務與遠洋航綫的開闢，以連成其應負之使命云云。</p>

<h3>千瘡百孔一波三折　浦濟段通車歷程本報特派記者</h3>
<p>— 凌松夀</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日航訊〕在津浦正綫上，滄縣至黃河北岸，泰安至韓莊，及蚌埠南北兩面，都被共匪澈底地破壞，而截成三段。在三十五年一月十三日，政府頒布停戰命令時，津浦路僅有天津至滄縣，濟南至泰安，及韓莊至浦口三段，能够通車。而最堪痛心的是沿路淄博，南新泰，和棗莊三大煤礦的骰備，悉遭共匪摧毀。由於整個的煤荒，成千的車輪停止轉動，全路的交通，入於癱瘓狀態。</p>
<p>停戰令頒布以後，共匪不但不停止他們這種爲害民生，斷傷國家元氣的叛逆的行爲，幷且變木加厲地用盡種種方法佔據車站，扣留車輛，　奪票款，自組路局，而破壞整個的鐵路管理系統。執行小組在泰安時，曾一度協議向南搶修，但是當修到大汶口時，復遭匪軍阻撓，幷且匪軍更攻陷泰安至炒米店間的九個車站。</p>
<p>局勢演變到這一個地步，事實上已經說明共匪的野心和企圖，他們絕不願意這條貫通南北的大動脈順利地復員起來，而有助於民生的安定。</p>
<p>隨着軍事局面的開展，路局決定不顧一切艱險和困難於卅五年十月九日起開始由韓莊向北興修。到十月廿四日，到達臨城。按照當時材料的充裕，和員工的興奮，原可繼讀向前搶修，無如其時臨城以北，烽火未靖，只有暫時停頓。</p>
<p>今年春間，山東戰事急轉直下，魯南重鎭的杏州，亦吿解圍。於是從三月十一日起開始從臨城向兗州搶修，工作五十六天後，終於在五月十八日，完成了徐查間通車這個偉大的任務。</p>
<p>從兗州到濟南這一段，全程計一四三公里，這一段因爲是在泰山山地附近，不但灣道，陡坡特多，而沿綫橋樑，都很高而長。如大汶河橋有半公里以上的長度，其餘如石甸橋，津河橋，其高度都在十四公尺至十八公尺之間。這一段的工程，是津浦全綫工程最困難的一段。</p>
<p>受了熱血和責任心的驅使。</p>
<p>津浦路局四萬二千位員工，不因環境的惡劣和工程的浩大而畏縮，在徐兗段通取以前，就開始了濟兗間土工的工作。舖軌和架橋，則於五月三十一日開始。起初的計　，本準備南自兗州，北自濟南，雙管齊下，以期工作早日完成。可是其時膠濟路已吿第二次中斷，濟南又形成了一座孤島。材料之運輸，困難異常。於是利用膠濟路撤退下來的員工，把濟南附近次要的岔綫，拆下來舖軌釘過。於七月底修到崗山站的南面，材料吿罄。復將這批人馬南調至兗州，參加自兗州向北搶修的工作。</p>
<p>從兗州向北的這一部份工程，進展相當順利。七月十日，已舖軌至後河南岸。可是因爲其時大汶口南驛一帶，戰雲密布，被迫停工兩月，到了九月十日重行開工。十四天後，最因難的工程—汶河橋的便橋已快架好，誰知二十三日夜間大雨，山洪暴發，致將即行竣工的便橋冲壞。直到十月六日，才竣工通車。鋪軌的工作，繼續了一個月後，已經到達泰山之麓，不期徐蚌交通，兩度中斷，材料接濟不上，稍有躭延。等到南段交通恢復以後，工作</p>
<p>加速前進終於在十一月二十九日夜間十一時，在張夏站北公里384到400處接軌。勝利後迄今兩年有餘，這條百孔千瘡的鐵路，終於在一波三折中完成了它最艱險的一份。</p>
<p>我登上了典禮專車，看看向蒲前面伸展出去的軌道，和鐵道兩旁的斷壁頹垣，以及若干破壞甚劇的橋樑，我實在形容不出我內心中是甚麼樣子的一個心境。記者於專軍中看到安文瀾隊長。他把接軌的那一夜的情形說給我聽。路局奉到交部的命令，是限十一月三十日前接軌通車。安隊長便決心在二十九日完竣。那天晚間，當他們的工作尙差一，七公里的距離的時候，忽然有一個情報，說是有股匪前來竄擾。安隊長於鄭重考慮之後，乃對全體員工說，四面鄕村中，並沒有狗呌的聲音，足以說明這個情報的不確實，乃繼續加工，卒於當日完成。其實，在當時安氏本人，根本也不能判斷匪情究竟如何，不過爲了貫澈</p>
<p>接軌通車的最終目標起見，自不得不以此安定員工之心，而完成這一段最後的工作。</p>
<p>修築汶河橋時，因六雨驟降，水位突增，波濤澎湃，因而落水者有七十餘人。再　修築者，有若干員工，冒深秋　水，裸體入水，以致罹疾，直到現在，尙在醬治之中。</p>

<p>浦濟段在千萬個人流血流汗之下，終算通車了。記者乘此由浦；到濟南的第一次直達專車，經過沿途各大小城池村鎭，千千萬萬的民衆皆以微笑的神情，來接受這一列車子所帶來的興奮和即將到來的一個光明的遠景。</p>

<h3>業外游資滲入　華股普遍上升</h3>
<p>華股昨初疲後回，業外游資滲入後，小型股及雜股，鋒芒畢露，引起普遍性之漲風。永紗等　股反形落後，前途續形恍惚。</p>
<p>晨初以外滙牌價並無變動之兆，且抽查倉庫管制行莊等不利影響忽起，永紗開四三三元及四四六元。開後升至四三六元及四四九元，施退至即交四二八元，遞交四三七元低價。華豐搪瓷現遞均吿漲停，永紗升至四三八元及四五二元，後微降為四三二元及四四四元，塲外終於軋空，較塲內提高達十元，人心步俏，各小型股籌碼甚涸，更易提高，各路游資吸收不已，燦爛滿目。閘北內衣統益中絲火柴在混亂中先迫漲限，繼之而永公統益中法商務新百中紡景綸麗安華新掛高至漲停板，近午永紗漲到即交四六六元，遞交四八〇元高價，而後以四六一元及四七五三元收市。結果較上週六計永紗升半成不到，中興小升，中泥新亞平平，信和美亞新光景福勤興五和各漲一成强，閘北中法新華內衣大通榮豐中紡漲停後有回，軋漲一成至成半，新華華豐麗安火柴商務中絲統益漲停板。遞交股計華豐永公漲停，信和美亞景福新光勤興各漲一成强，永紗升半成。</p>
<p>後市仍見俏利，上塲時漲停者達十六種之多，永紗進至四七五元及四八五元新高價，旋回低至四六六元及四七二元，後雖進至四七〇元四八〇元，國行差進甚多，以有了結及進後即出者，跌至四六一元及四六七元，收市為四六四元及四六八元，僅華豐新華景綸中泥中紡商務漲停外餘咸回落。結果較晨收即交股計勤興永公大通平平新亞升半成，華新閘北信和新光景福內衣麗安火柴中絲統益榮豐徵挫，華豐新華中泥景綸商務漲停，餘均小升。遞交股除華豐漲停餘咸微回，塲外各老股新新上泥漲一成，五洲亦然，大生文化股各升半成。</p>
<h3>造紙增產計劃決定　明處白紙木漿將大量加多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國經濟委員會曾於本月十二十三兩日，召開造紙增產會議，出席機關及民營廠代表及專農業用地三十餘人。經兩日這研究及討論，產生重要決議如下：</p>
<p>增產：今年國內白紙產量為六萬六千噸，明年擬提高至十一萬噸，今年之紙版產量為五萬噸，明年度預計提高至七萬噸，共計增產約七萬噸，希望其中一半用報紙。</p>
<p>木漿增產：除明年度凖備進口五萬噸之外，並擬提高國內工廠之生產並建立新木漿廠，新廠共計五個，靑島廠，日產二十噸；上海廠，日產三十至五十噸；浙江廠，日產二十噸；另設機械木漿廠，日產三十噸；天津廠日產十至二五噸；湖南廠，日產五十噸。此外台南紙廠決定實行增產，預定四個月後，每日可產蔗渣漿六十噸，但以有煤為先決條件，因原料即以有煤為先決條件，因原料即以煤易取。宜賓中國造紙廠，半年後每日可生產杉木漿五噸，一年半後可產四十噸。</p>
<p>會議中並決定，製造木漿及造報紙之機器，應予以結滙之便利。在各項造紙用之器材中，鈾銅絲綱准予進口，製造上等紙所用之毛毯亦准入口，製造次等紙所用之毛毯則限制進口，中國不能自造之帆布亦允其輸入。</p>
<p>此外並擬開設銅絲毛毯廠各一個，所需外滙由政府供給，流通資本則由民廠目籌。關於銅絲綱毛毯帆布三項器材之今後供應，決定組織一器材供應委員會，由工商輔導處資委會及各區代表合組，共同審查。</p>
<p>又據出席會議之輔導處化工組長陳陶心吿記者：在此計劃之下，如各方能通力合作，則二三年內我國紙張將能自給。今後進口之先紙張，原則上將限於三類，即報紙捲烟紙及玻璃紙；其中捲烟紙一項，每月平均用去十萬捲，但民豐造紙廠明年可出六萬至八萬捲，希望於一年關至二年之內，進口能逐漸减少，進而完全自給。</p>
<p>此次全經會召開之會議，有兩項重大收穫，一為如無以上之計劃，明年靑島廠恐將停工，本市紙償將减產，台灣西南之紙廠亦只能維持現狀；二為增產計劃實行，節省外滙多，可移用於購買造紙之設備。</p>
<p>食糖續升</p>
<p>昨糖市因去化略增而趨上展，白糖續升四六七萬不一，靑赤糖升三四五萬包。公會劃盤，二四粗白大包一百二十七八萬元，二〇中砂白一百廿三萬元，台赤一百廿三萬元，計百餘包。興化白高貨一百廿二萬五千無，簍莊一百十八九萬元，興赤一百十二萬元至十萬元，計八百餘件。刁靑八十八萬地，計三百餘包。</p>
<p>商業簡訊</p>
<p>中信局十一月份標售敵產，共得一千五百億元，較上月份多五百億元</p>
<p>國行會計處處長金國寳，八月間赴美出席國際統計學公議，已公畢自美返國，於十四日抵滬。</p>
<p>昨日捲烟初低後回，十支犬英老刀二烟，比上日軋升卅五萬至廿五萬元，此外中外各烟亦較堅挺</p>
<p>日用品肥皂，交易尙佳，固本箭刀祥茂軋軟光華牛牌亭利等，挺升五六七萬元，火柴市亦不振。</p>
<p>木材市况，杉木因產地吿漲，市氣堅挺，市價巳穿五千元外</p>
<p>據靑市港務局統計：十一月份進出口貨計進口總量六萬零一百八十一噸，煤炭估百分之卅，麵粉木料魚類次之。出口一萬八千五百四十四噸，鹽類棉紗各估百分之八十二，次為酒類。</p>

<h3>嚴復與黑格爾</h3>
<p>— 佐禹</p>
<p>嚴幾道先生在我國思想界之地位至高。淸末民初西洋新思想之　入嚴氏之力爲多。憶兒時就讀鄕間高級小學，敎師李某，思想稍新，授余等嚴譯天演論。余讀而好之，幾能全篇背誦。後進中學大學，嚴譯名著，如社會通詮，羣已權界論，穆勒名學，注意，原富等書，遂爲余搜尋硏讀之對象。此不獨喜其思想之新穎，亦喜其文章之古雅謹嚴也。民初學子爲文，一提筆輒有「物競天擇，適者生存」等語，其爲受嚴氏影響，經無疑義。居今日而論我國之新文化運動、嚴氏之功，不可沒也。</p>
<p>惟以嚴氏所譯各書言，嚴氏介紹之西洋思想，似僅以十九世紀英國之進化論及功利主義爲限。如斯賓塞（Spencer），如赫胥黎（Huxley），言進化者也。如亞當斯密士（Adam　Smith），如穆勒（Mill），言功利者也。進化論與功利主義之輸入我國，嚴氏當負其責。西洋哲學上之正統思想，如康德（Kant），黑格爾（Hegel）諸賢之說，嚴氏無專書介紹。此今日言西洋正統哲學者，頗引爲憾事。世之論嚴氏者，亦因嚴氏未譯康黑諸賢之　，或誤認嚴氏對此諸賢之說無所知。實則嚴氏雖未譯康黑書，然於康黑之說非無所知，亦非絕無介紹。嚴氏嘗著「述黑格兒惟心論」一文，刋諸寰球中國學生報第二期。此文知者甚少，坊間嚴氏文鈔中亦不載。吾人讀嚴氏此文，即知嚴氏於黑格爾之說，固深有硏究者。文末附嚴氏按語，尤足表現嚴氏對西洋正統思想之認識。特錄其按語如下；</p>
<p>「嚴復曰，歐洲之言心性，至迪迦爾（Descartes）而一變，至汗德（Kant）而再變，自是以降，若拂特（Fichte），若勰林（Schelling），若黑格兒（Hegel），若壽朋好兒（Schopenhauer），皆推大汗德之所發明者也。然亦人有增進，足以補前哲之所未逮者。而黑壽二子，所得尤多。故能各有所立，即德意志之哲學，遂與古之希臘，後先競爽矣。考汗德所以爲近代哲學不祧之宗者，以澄澈宇宙二物爲人心之良能，其於心也，猶五官之於形幹。夫空間時間，二者果在內而非由外矣，則喬答摩境由心造，與儒者致中和，天地位，萬物育之理，皆中邊澄澈，而爲不刋之說明矣。黑格兒本於此說，故惟心之論興焉。古之言化也，以在內者爲神明，以在外者形氣，二者不相謀而相絕者也。而黑則以謂一切惟心，特主客二觀異耳。此會汗德迪迦爾二家之說以爲說者也。由是而推古今歷史之現象，起伏變减，皆客觀心理想之所爲。然而其中有秩序焉，則化之進而共趨於無對待之心境此鄙人所譯爲皇極是已。故其言化也，往往爲近世天演家之僑矢，又於吾國往聖之精旨微言有相發者。（如張橫渠云：「爲大地立心」，試問天地之心於何而見？）黑氏著論至多，後之學者，輒苦難讀。丙午夏日，鄙人自皖旋滬。適寰球學生報出。總理李君登輝等，　門求文字，前後書七八通，殆不可己，則勉强揮汗，爲發黑氏之蘊如右。所論止於生客觀二心，尙有無對待心者，則未暇及也。」</p>
<p>此按語雖僅寥寥百字，然非於西洋正統思想已入其門奧者，不能道也。嚴氏之於黑格爾，其非無研究，即此可爲明證。此外嚴氏文中對黑氏哲學名辭之中譯，亦有一二點可注意。如普通譯Dialectic爲辯證法，此不甚安。張東蓀氏嘗譯爲對演法，賀薩氏又嘗譯爲矛盾法，而嚴氏在此文中則譯爲「相生名曰」。且　：「黑氏之吾名學也、謂理之相克者恒相生。近而譬之，如管察之法愈嚴，將奸究之術亦愈密。老子所言，大抵皆此等名學。」此一譯名實近人所未注意及之者。又普通譯Sbsolute爲絕對，賀麟氏曾譯爲太極，而嚴氏在此文中，則譯爲「皇極」。太極之與皇極，孰爲可取，似亦不易輕爲判斷者。作者因世人多知嚴氏與進化論及功利主義有淵源，而不知彼於黑氏哲學，亦有研究，因略言之如右。</p>
<h3>羅素的童年　謝幼偉</h3>
<p>·羅素自述之一·</p>
<p>英哲羅素（Bertrand　Russell）是當代最偉大的思想家，他的學問文章，早爲國人所知道。他曾來我國講學，對我國思想界實有相當的影響。他的學問非常廣博，他不僅是哲學家，也是科學家。他談政治問題，談社會閒題，復談敎育問題。所談均不落故常，時有新意。他現在將近八十歲了，依然健在，依然不斷的寫作。前年尙出版了一本八百多頁的鉅著；西洋哲學史。精力充滿，令人驚佩。他怎樣造成他現在的地位？他的治學經過爲何？他的思想發展的階段爲何？這些都有我們知道的價値。最近美國西北大學所編的當代哲人業書中有「羅素哲學」（The　Philosophy　of　Bertradd　Russell　一九本人的自述一文題爲「我的心態發展」（My　Mental　Eental　Eevelopment），詳述他個人治學的經過。關於他早年，中年，及晚年思想轉變的原因，都有確切的表白。凡研究學問的人似乎都有一讀的必要。惜篇幅過長，不能全部介紹。作者打算握要的分爲三段，加以叙述。現在先來叙述他童年的思想和生活。</p>
<p>羅素出身貴族，他的祖父約翰·羅素（Lord　John　Russell）曾做過英國的外相。他的父親恩巴利·羅素（Lord　AmberleyRuessll）也曾做過英國國會議員。羅素早孤，也的父親死時，也僅三歲，他的母親死時，他僅二歲。他是由他的祖父撫義成人的。他的思想似乎直接沒有受到他的父母的影響，可是他的思想，奇怪得很，却和他的父親有不少相同處。他是自由主義者，他的父親也是自由主義者。他的父親很相信約翰穆勒（J．S．　Mill）的學說，主張女子參政，和生育節制。他對宗敎沒有熱誠，他的父親在二十一歲的時候也不相信基督敎，不到敎堂。就是他的母親，思想也很前進，也主張男女平等。假如一人的思想是可以遺傳的話，羅氏思想便是得諸遺傳的一例。</p>
<p>羅素自認爲他在幼年，頗受他的祖母的影響。他的祖母是一位淸敎徒，生活非常嚴肅。對於衣食，不重視，對於飲酒吸烟，尤爲反對。她願意她的子孫成爲有用和有品德的人，却不需要他們獲取世俗的榮華。她相信私人判斷和個人良心的尊嚴。在他十二歲生日的時候，羅氏的祖母送他一本聖經，這本聖經羅氏到現在還保存着。在這本聖經上，他的祖母寫上多少聖經上她所喜歡的格言，其中之一是，「你不當追隨羣衆，去做惡事；「又一是，「要自强，要勇敢；不要怕，也不要驚；因你所到之處你主上帝是隨着你的。」這些格言，羅氏說：「曾深切的影響我的生活，到我不相信上帝之後，似乎仍保留着多少意義。」</p>
<p>當羅氏十一歲時，他即開始讀歐立克的幾何學。首先他對歐氏頗爲失望，因歐氏以公理開始，而公理是須得沒有證明而被接受的。但讀完之後，他却非常歡喜他。因此在他全部的童年期內，大部分的興趣便集中在數學上。他對於數學發生興趣，自謂其原因是複雜的：一部分是由於他發現他有某種按巧，一部分是由於他喜歡演繹推理的能力，一部分是由於數學確定性的寗靜；但最主要的理由（當他尙是幼年）是由於他相信自然乃依照數學定律而運行，如我們有充分的技巧，則人類行動，也如天體行動一樣，是能被預測的。他自謂在十五歲的時候，他即想出一種和法哲笛卡兒極爲相同的理論。他深信有機體的行動完全爲機械定律所支配；所以自由意志之說必定是虛假的。不過，他又不能接受唯物諭，因爲他相信意識是一種不可懷疑的「與料」（Datum）。這時候他仍相信上帝，緣他認爲上帝存在的第一因論證（FirstCanse　Argnment）是不可駁斥的。</p>
<p>羅氏的童年並沒有進過學校。他幼年的敎育，完全是家庭敎師的敎育。他由幾位德國和瑞士的看護和保姆敎導，以後則由英國敎師在家內訓誨。他自謂在十四五歲的時候，對於宗敎的興趣很濃。他逐漸把自由意志，靈魂不朽，及上帝存在等論證加以硏究。他的生活非常枯寂。他感覺沒有可以談話的人。他硏究所得，只能自己用希臘字母寫在日記上，不敢對人說。足足有三年的時間，他的精神集中在宗敎問題上。首先他把自由意志之說抛棄，後又把靈魂不朽之說抛棄，但直到十八歲的時候，他才不信上帝。原因是，那時候他適讀穆勒的自傳，中有一語云：「我的父親敎導我說，「誰造我？」的問題是不能回答的，因爲這問題馬上引起了另一問題，即「誰造上帝呢？」這樣他便決定認爲上帝存在的第一因論證是錯誤的。</p>
<p>在家庭敎育期內，羅氏讀書的範圍很廣。他讀書沒有人指導，所以他自認爲讀了許多無用的書。他曾讀過許多壞詩，特別是但尼孫和拜崙。直到十七歲的時候，他才找到雪萊的詩來讀。在許多年內，雪萊是他最喜歡的古人。他也曾讀過不少加萊的文章，尤崇拜他「過去與現在」一書。和他的意見最爲相同的是穆勒。穆勒的書，如「政治經濟學」，如「論自由」及「論婦女的壓迫」，都曾深切的影響他。他也曾把穆勒的名學細讀過，且寫了許多眉批。但穆勒視數學命題爲經騐的槪括的主張，他是不能同意的，雖然他尙不知道數學命題能是什麼。</p>
<p>直到十八歲，他才進劍橋大學。這樣才終止了他在家庭內的枯寂生活，而開闢了他在學術上的新天地。</p>

<p>一，審美經騐裏的心是靜觀的或冥想的靜觀或冥想這個詞　常常用在審美底態度上，換句話說，我們常常說審美底態度是靜觀的或冥想的。例如我們說一個自然底愛好者，一個藝術品底欣賞者或批評者，對於他們所愛好的，欣賞的，或批評的對象所持的態度是靜觀的或其想的。同時，我們說他們底態度是審美的；雖然他們底態度之審美底成分不如創作的藝術家所表現者眞切而充分；因爲眞正審美底態度消極方面不能陷溺於所欣賞的對象之中，昏迷流蕩，往而不返，一至失其湛然明覺，超然淸淨之本心；但一般藝術底欣賞者，如戲劇或跳舞底觀衆，音樂會底聽衆却很容易被他們所欣賞的對象所淹沒或牽走了；創作的藝術家就必須保特他底淸明，很自由地追尋他審美經經底情節而設法如實地表現出來。由此我們可以知道，眞正審美底態度，積極方面，是表現的，主動的；而不僅僅是一種被動的享受。總而言之，審美經騐裏，靜點的心，是淸明的，湛寂的，主動的；牠沒有物質享受之中的饜足，也沒有物質享受之中的貪着。這種靜觀底態度和理論底，以及實踐底態度都有牠們底對象，或是向着向牠們底對象而發的。但是理論底和實踐底態度對於牠們底對象都有所造作，有所改變，實踐底特點是以意志創造對象。理論底特點是用概念去說明對象。審美底特點是靜觀地表現對象，而不去改變牠底對象。即在創造的藝術中，那創造品也是一種知覺，而附屬於充分的想像，完全的「觀」，「聽」，這一點以後再　。</p>
<p>二，審美經騐裏的情是具體表現在一個結構或形體之中的。這是審美底情感　常重要的一個特點。因爲一般沒有結構的，或沒有一定的形式之表現的情感，是不淸楚的，私有的，隨着個人底身心之變化遷流不定，容易消逝的。牠底對象是帶有思想的自然物，而不是情感底表現。在這裏面不能有較深刻的高級的審美經騐。如果你有力量把你底情感所寄託的對象或內容刻畫出來，而給牠一個想像的形式，或表現爲詩，或表現爲畫，或表現爲音樂等等。那麼你底對象成了一種確定的有法則的客觀的對象；並且你底以及別人對於牠底情感都要服從牠底法則，而不能任意法轉，起減不定；相反地，這時的情感必須是常住的，有秩序的，和諧的，簡單言之，有價値的了。如果牠是喜，你那個喜的心淸淸楚楚地感覺到你底喜悅，同時也了然你所喜的是什麼；如果牠是憂，你那個憂的心也淸淸楚楚的感覺到你底哀戚，同時也了然你所悲的是什麼。總而言之，你這時的對象譬如一顆雕刻透露，鑲嵌精緻的寶石，是有具體的形式可觀，一定的準繩可帶，而全體是你底情感之表現，所以這時你底情感和你底對象變成了一體，也有了具體的形式和法則歷久不變，明晰瑩澈，可以傳遞。人所共喩，而不是一種混沌糢糊，自我專注，昏迷的私情了·這一種具體表現的情感，當你感覺到的時候，就是審美底情感。</p>
<h3>學林叢話（二）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>生聚之科學</p>
<p>美國約翰霍普金大學校長鮑曼傳士（Inaiah　Bowman）曾任美國科學促進會會長一九四三年九月十一日該會在俄亥俄州利夫蘭（Cleveland）舉行年會，鮑氏致　，題爲「國富之掌握」，（Commanding　Our　Wealth）原稿載於美國科學周判。（Soicnce同年九月十五日）此篇特別提到中國，請略述要旨以供參鏡。</p>
<p>飽曼謂倘使大戰以後，人民仍未能享受合乎情理的生活，則可謂勝利並未獲得。他引德國俾斯麥的話，國民擁有豐富資源而茫昧無知，或雖知之而不能充分利用，則資源之富適足以招致國難。所以他主張建國之道人民第一，土地第二。中國與美國不同之處在於中國單靠農業，所謂以農立國，土地爲養命之源，而農民常在飢餓綫上掙扎。在美國則農業不過爲立國要素之一，工業發達，技術精進」工業與農業，城市與鄕村，互相扶掖，當保平衡，故人民生活較爲美滿。今日建國之道，列舉要點爲墾荒造林，治水保土，利用機械，開發資源，振與工業，發展運輸，藉以增加就業機會，提高生活水準，維護社會正義，促進國際合作。僅就農產一項言之，如何增加產額，改善品質，推廣市塲，穩定價値，條理紛繁，關係錯綜。但此類事業決非空泛原則所能收效，必須從事於精詳之區域研究，何處宜林，何處宜牧，即在同一地方，因高度不同，氣候植物與人民生計亦隨之而異，分區考察，與實驗工作，爲建國大業之基本。和平之樹，其根須深植於科學研究之上，方能爛漫向榮。此類學問，鮑曼名之曰生聚之科學，（Science　of　Settlhment）斯學之宗旨即爲土地人口資源三者之掌握與調劑。</p>
<p>目前世界各國之國界不能任意加以變更，各國均注重於國內統一與民族團結，對外來移民不能同化者多不表歡迎。建國方針莫如就自己領土以內，講求發展富源利用厚生之道。中國亦如歡洲，誠能和平建設，足以支持全國人口。求人不如求己，海外移民方面，欲求維持南洋僑胞之歷史地位，已極費心力。鮑曼之意，白澳主義一類政策，如承認其有現由，則扶助中國之經濟建議乃當然之結論。中國工業化問題對於世界和平至爲重要。世界不能一部分殘破荒凉，一部分繁榮快樂。自誇國力，不恤他人者等於自欺，其危險性極大。以美國工業之盛，而自鄧刻爾克（Dunkirk）一役以後，經過四年之經營，始能發揮國力，克敵制勝，足爲前車之鑒·有此觀點，方知美國援華，非惟助人，亦爲自助之舉。</p>
<p>羅士培與萊德論中國</p>
<p>英國文化委員會駐華代表羅士培敎授（Percy　Manld　Poxby）於今年三月間歿於南京任所，中國失一知心之友。羅氏早年在牛津大學讀歷史，畢業後又從侯伯特生敎授（A.J.Herbertson）研究地理學·一九○八年因侯氏之推薦任利物浦大學講師，一九一七年升敎授，前後幾四十年，敎澤至廣。氏曾三次來華，一九一二年初來，一九二一年重遊，一九四五年偕夫人同蒞陪都，担任中英文化合作之職務。氏會著關於遠東問題之諭文多篇，大英百料全書中中國諸節亦多出於氏之手筆，於促進兩國瞭解的同情，貢獻甚大。氏深愛中國之哲學與藝術，對於我國農村之貧苦，關懷至深。戰時曾寫成「中國」一書，供英國軍事當局之參攷，聞不久可印行公世。氏生於一八八○年，事夀六十七歲。</p>
<p>倫敎大學退休敎授萊德（LionelWillian　Lyde）於本年一月間逝世，氏生於一八六三年，年八十四歲。氏爲英國地理學耆宿之一，與侯伯特生麥欽德（Mackinder）等齊名，各有貢獻。氏亦爲牛津大學畢業生，於文學史學根據特深。早年著作敎本，風行英國·一九〇三年始在倫敦大學講學，至一九二八年退休。所著如歐洲地理（一九三年）亞洲地理（一九三三）等書，學者據爲典要。氏對於中國文化有深刻之認識，據倫敦大學斯坦普敎授（L.D.Stamp）言，萊氏的地理哲學實受中國思想之影饗</p>
<p>羅士培與萊德這一輩學者對於中國問題是有很通達的見解。他們喜以中國與歐洲相提並諭，蓋以中國幅員之廣，人口之衆，確乎可與整個歐洲相比。中國自泰漢以來，雖有分廚離析之時，但始終能保持大一統的規模。歐洲自羅馬衰亡以後，不曾再度統一，其故殊耐深思。他們以為中國文化自有其優點，以歐洲比中國，方可知我建國事業之艱鉅。我國先哲之論國是，貴於使離心力與向心力保其平衡，今日建國思想，仍應發揮這種優良傳統，一面使地方自治潑進行，一面使國家統一圓滿成功，內外相維，以固邦基，庶可毋負海外知音對我的期望。</p>

<h3>祝國營招商局七十五週年紀念</h3>
<p>— 李景</p>
<p>我國航輪組織之　始，首推船商局，招商局目前淸同治十一年創辦，迄今歷七十五載。當其創辦之初，粗具規模；惜因政治，人事種種未能配合，進步阻滯，民國以後，第一次世界大戰時，我國雖獲發展航業之機緣，而以政府扶　乏力，外輪排擠，業務亦末獲合理之發展。政府奠都南京，重視航運建設，迭經交通部派員整理，至二十六年事變之前，招商局共有大小輪船薨駁五三艘，計八萬餘噸。抗戰軍興，沿海淪陷，所有航海輪船，於担任革公運輸之餘，或沉或燬，或暫轉外籍，故戰時招商局，西遷入川者，僅大小江輪二十餘艘，計二萬五千餘噸而已。勝利復員，航權收回，招商局接管敵僞船隻，並積極購進盟國海輪，業務擴展，迄現在爲止，共有輪船四百六十艘，計三十三萬三千餘噸，與戰時比較，增加已多，較諸戰前，亦已增加四倍，是誠我國艱苦奮鬥之所獲，良堪慶慰。現招商局徐總經理學禹曁全體員工，均能體念責任重大，戳力推進、外則淸理債務，內則革除積弊，局務一新，前途無量，尤爲交通界同人所欽慰。</p>
<p>我國航業政策，採取國營民營並重，此與郵電鐵路有別者，是以國營航業，宜致力於艱巨工作之担負，避免與民營爭利，兼以扶植民營航業。此項政策之推進，其顯而易見者，即招商局於戰後側重發展外洋航行，對於內河航行期能由民營航業担任。蓋外洋航業，有關國際競爭，如以國力領導，較易爲功，日本旣已戰敗，其遠東之航運勢力，理應由我國起而代之，欲達此項鵠的，深望以國營爲中堅，配合民營，抱同舟共濟之精神，合作邁進，俾與世界航業，並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>茲値招商局成立七十五週年紀念，追念前賢創業之宏規，懍於第一次大戰後我國航業失去振興機會之前轍，瞻念今後航業與日更新之前途，譬諸七十五齡之老人，業已返老還童矣。略述往跡，兼勵來茲，謹抒所見，用期共勉。</p>
<h3>國營招商局勝利復員來業務槪況</h3>
<p>— 胡時淵</p>
<p>我國唯一國營輪船業機構「國營招商局，」遠創於前淸同治十一　（西歷一八七二年），當時命名爲「輪船招商公局」，由北洋大臣　　總督李鴻章氏率淸廷之　設立，迄今已七十五年於茲。在過去七十五年之中，我國迭受敵國外患之侵脅，以及不平等條約之束縛，招商局由萌芽以至成長，可云無時不在艱若階段之中，此次抗戰勝利，招商局於八年戰爭慘　損失之餘，迅速復興，不僅恢復戰前舊觀，且業務情形及運　力量，均勝過戰前數倍之多，其發展情形，諒爲國人所同關心，茲特擇要舉述如次·</p>
<p>（一）船舶之增加</p>
<p>招商局在抗戰以前，原有江輪十二艘共三三·七八四·五四總噸，海輪十六艘，共三七·五七五·九九總噸，小輪十二艘共一·一二○·三三總噸，另有鐵駁六艘，夢船七艘，總共噸位八萬餘噸，抗戰發生後，招商局輪船被炸沉者有九艘，炸燬者三艘，被徵用塞港者十五艘，損失綦重，勝利後除戰時在後方保存之一部份船舶及留用若干接收敵偽之船舶外，經先後向國外購到大批海輪以供運用截至最近爲止招商局所有船舶及噸位計如左列：</p>
<p>（一）海輪　六一艘　一八六·二七八·四六總噸</p>
<p>（二）江輪　二八艘　五六·一二八·二四總噸</p>
<p>（三）拖輪及小輪　一四二艘　一五·九一一·五一總噸</p>
<p>（四）鐵木駁及特種船隻　二二九艘　七四·八四○·六四總噸</p>
<p>共計　四六○艘　三三三之·六四四·六三總噸</p>
<p>（按本篇船隻及噸位數字係本年十一月底止之統計包括新添之成功鴻章敎仁鐵橋四艘在內其餘資料則根據八月底之統計故有差異　請讀者注意　編者）依照右表所列噸位約合戰前噸位之四倍就運輸力量增加情形而言可云進步甚速（二）航綫之分佈勝利後，招商局除迅即恢復長江中下游及沿海各口岸航運外並將航綫展至國外各地，其現有之航綫，計如左列：甲·長江錢：</p>
<p>除上述各航綫及船隻外，其餘船駁均作爲輔助　　船·供應各項重要運輸，並一部份祖任天津上海各港駁運工作，　因臘商局祖任軍公商運，業務至爲繁重，現在所有船隻，實際上仍不數需要甚鉅，而開關海外射綫，尤盼添浩大批新船，始足以臘　要，預計明年內招商局可有購自國外之客輪四艘及江甫造船所承造之客輪兩艘加入航運，當可適應一部份需要，又招商局爲辦理各線業務，在國內外各坦設立之分支機構及代理處計如左列！</p>
<p>重慶分局，萬縣辦事處，宜昌分局，沙市辦事處，漢口分</p>
<p>局，長沙辦事處，九江分局，安慶辦事處，蕪湖分局，南京分</p>
<p>局，鎭江分局，營口分局，葫蘆島分局，秦皇島辦事處，天津</p>
<p>分局，塘沽辦事處，煙台辦事處，靑島分局，海州分局，寗波</p>
<p>分局，鎭海辦事處，溫州辦事處，福州辦事處，台北分局，基</p>
<p>隆辦事處，高雄辦事處，厦門分局，汕頭分局，香港分局，廣</p>
<p>州分局，湛江辦事處，馬尼刺代理處，海防代理處，曼谷代理</p>
<p>處，新加坡代理處，仰光代理處，加爾各答代理處，海口代理</p>
<p>處，就上述航錢分佈及分支機構設置情形而論，招商局在航運界之地位，顯甚重要，並巳具備相當之基礎，今後如何更加發展推進，當爲其主要課題。</p>
<p>（三）業務上之新措施：</p>
<p>我國航業，素稱落後，舍工具不善問題而外，管理方面亦頗有必須改進之處，招商局對於革新工作，至爲注意，茲舉其重要之措施，槪述如次：</p>
<p>（1）澈底摧毁買辦制度：我國辦理航運業務，一切法制大都參照洋商成規辦理，買辦制度，即係洋商所一手造成，流弊所及，造成買辦特殊階級，處處居間漁利，上下其手，而爲業務上之重要阻礙。招商局爲澈底整刷業務，使能負荷發展中國航業之重任，對於過去買辦制度，及類似買辦制度，悉予擴淸摧毁，不容絲毫遺留，故目前招商局工作人員，决無絲毫買辦習氣，實爲改革航業之要着。</p>
<p>（2）改革理貨制度：輸船理貨制度，爲買辦制度附帶產生之制度，在昔輪船業務由買辦承辦之時，其所謂買辦者，均自僱有若干理貨人員，隨船居住，辦理輪船理貨工作，此制最大之弊端，厥爲船上用人增多，船上客位爲一部份理貨人員佔據，旣增開支，又糜舖位，船隻較少之公司，其所受損失尙不甚大，擁有數目　船之招商局，即感頗不經濟。故招商局自三十六年起，　　　　　口威例，　輪船理貨制度，逐步改爲碼頭理貨制度，原有船上　貨人員，調至各埠岸上工作，此制推行以來，騰出輪船賽位甚多，旣可利用疏運部份旅客，　可增加客運收益，而岸上理貨效率復較輪船理貨效率提高甚多，故此項改革，可云我國航業界一大革新。</p>
<p>（3）輪船服務生：　侍應工作，現代旅館業及運輸業，均極注重，良以旅客在故途之中，最需享受安逸與舒適，輪船服務生之使命，即爲如何待應旅客，使有賓至如歸之感。惟欲辦到此點，事實上頗不易易，招商局基於侍應工作之重要性，爲提高輪船服務生之侍應能力起見，特開設訓練班，長期辦理服務生抽調訓練事宜，其目的即務期使每一輪船服務生能確切執行侍應工作，切實爲旅客服務。</p>
<p>（4）舉辦聯運業務：招商局爲便利商貨遠銷起見，特與平漢鐵路及大美輪船公司辦理聯運，凡向該局託運聯運貨物，一經報裝完妥，即可在起運地點取得聯運提單，向銀行辦理押滙，對於商人資金之週轉，殊爲便利，惟國外聯運因船期銜接及部份運費須結付外滙關係，尙蕪成效，此則有賴出口商與招商局共同商討改進者也。</p>
<p>（5）注意客貨服務：運輸業霧之性質，即爲出售服務，故辦理運輸，而不知服務者，其必非優良之業務，顧所謂服務之目標，除運輸自身必備之條件，如安全迅速舒適必須具備而外，尙須處處爲客商方面着想，斯方足以云盡服務之精神，招商局有鑒於此，對於推進服務工作，極爲注意，例如辦理代客報關，代客保險，汽車接送旅客行李，設立碼頭售票處，候船室，問訊處，以及改進客貨運業務手續等等，皆其一例。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>現代世界强國，無不注意海洋運輸，藉以拓展國力，爭取世界市塲，以爲繁榮富强之計，我國欲談復興建設，亦必循此途徑努力，戰後列强內河航行特權取消，我國航業欣欣向榮，殊具無限之希望，國營招商局在政府領導及各界匡助之下，幸已粗具相當規模，今後自當益爲戮力推進，以副國人期望，所冀羣策羣力，庶使成爲遠東最大航運機構，並使我國成爲世界主要海運國家，則國家前途實所利賴焉。</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 徐學禹</p>
<p>國營招商局創立至今，已是七十五年了，在此七十五年悠長的歲月中，國事的變遷，政局的動盪，外交的得失，組織的改易，人事的更替，設施的更張，業務的興衰，實爲中國交通史中重要之一頁，吾人在此紀念日檢討過去，應付現在，策劃將來，自覺無限興奮，除編了一本紀念册子以外，還在與招商局同有七十五年歷史的申報附印一張特刋，無非要使關心航業的人士知道一些關于招商局的報道，並且賜予我們以指敎，寄予我們以同情，給予我們以鼓勵，使得我們更加奮勉，使得同業間更相合作，使得中國航運事業日趨進步而至于理想的境地。</p>
<p>中國航業在此七十五年中，雖于碼頭倉庫的設備樹立了一些基礎。而于船舶的噸位和性能，以及造船修船的設備，實在無足稱道，差與世界其他海洋國家相比較，更是望塵莫及了，我們今天反躬自省，祗有慚悚和警惕的分兒，那裏敢存些微自慰日豪的念頭！</p>
<p>勝利復員以來的二年中，中國航業由殘剩的不及十萬噸的船舶逐漸增加至八十五萬餘噸，可謂有史以來進步最速的一個時期，這固然是有賴于政府的賢明政策，但也有賴于友邦的協助，和同業的通力合作，如此繼續進行下去，不久的將來我們的航業使可與世界其他海洋國家相角逐了，如果招商局的創立可以代表中國航業發　的話，那十二月十六日的一天，應該不是慶祝年逾古稀的華誕，而是慶祝甫經出世的湯餅盛會，將來這個嬰孩由小而大，立身揚名，當有賴于大衆的愛護咧。</p>
<h3>國營招商局七十五週年紀念</h3>
<p>— 劉鴻生</p>
<p>創業難，守成不易，而不知復興尤爲艱難，在七十五年以前，海禁開放，外輪出入我國沿海內河者，絡繹不絕，組織航業公司，把持航運，而本局方於此時設立，購得輪船四艘，承運漕糧，兼運商貨，在天津上海各購碼頭一處，以資儲轉。其時本局尙在萌芽期間，旣有沙船之阻撓，復有外輪之競爭，甚至局輪向外商保險公司，投保水險，竟遭拒絕。幸在北洋大臣李公鴻章，毅力主持之下，卒能招集商股，添勝船隻，收購美商旗昌輪船公司之全部輪船碼頭，復由盛公宣懷督辦，局務着着進行，本局基礎方吿奠定，創業之難，於此可見。</p>
<p>本局基礎奠定之後，自宜運用其固有之人力財力，力謀發展，乃不幸國勢孱弱，有中法，中日，及八國聯軍之戰事，致本局船隻一再換旗，內港航權，迭次開放，外商輪船公司，復得其政府之協助，稱雄於我國江海之上，本局雖亦陸續添置船隻碼頭，但欲與資力雄厚之外輪公司競爭，實非易事，以致南北洋長江航錢業務幾爲外輪所包辦。至商辦時期之最後數年，營業衰落，舉債度日，船舶陳舊，無款修理，維特現狀，尙且不遑，焉能發展？守成之不易也如此。迨改國營，鴻生承乏總經理，幸承朱部長主持，借用中英庚款，建造海輪四艘，及以借款添購海雲輪船，但舊輪之因不堪行駛而停航者亦有五艘，一消一畏，噸位如舊，蹉跎三年，愧無成績，遂乃退避賢路。不久抗戰軍興，本局船隻有自行擊沉者，有被敵機炸燬者，有出售於英商者，所存大小船舶，祗十八艘，且有向來行駛長江上游者，船身大，吃水深，無法在川江運用，在此非常時期，幾屬無成可守，本局遭遇重重之困難，回首前塵，斯時眞有風雨飄搖之感。</p>
<p>幸在勝利前二年，英美取銷不平等條約，收回航權，其後日寇投降，日輪絕跡於我國領海之內，此正復興本局業務之一絕大機會，而復員期間，本局所負軍公運應之使命，極爲重大，幸徐總經理在日寇投降之前，抱抗戰必勝之信念，將在渝大小江輪，借款修竣，勝利後，復員工作得以順利完成，其眼光之遠大大可知矣。本局遷滬以來，徐總經理秉承交通部之指揮，及同仁等在徐總經理領導之下，努力把持機會、埋頭苦幹，現在船隻方面：連政府預向美加兩國訂購之船隻在內，有三十三萬總噸；棧埠方面：在淪陷期間，碼頭倉庫，損壞不堪，收回之後，逐一修理，復向敵僞產業處理局，租得碼頭四座，配合業務之用；業務方面：恢複長江南北洋航綫之外，復開闢新航錢，遠至曼谷，加爾各答，新加坡，馬尼拉，日本，南美等處。業務蒸蒸日上，此外整頓碼頭秩序，取銷貼力，改行碼頭理貨制度等等，凡所設施，無一非復興本局業務之要團，蓬蓬勃勃，如朝日之初升，充滿新生之氣象，徐總經理復興民營航業公司，通力合作，抱共榮之目的，負起整個運輸之全責，具此毅力，前途之發展，未可限量，但當局之慘淡經營，其艱難比之創業，爲尤甚也。今値本局七十五週年紀念日，鴻生備位理事，躬逢其盛，極爲榮幸，撫古思今，略述感想，特慚衰病交侵，未能稍盡棉力耳</p>

<p>遜淸北洋大臣（後升爲傅相）李鴻章氏，以輸船運輸，可禦外侮，利商旅，决心創辦華商輪船局，經一再籌備，於同治十一年（一八七二）扎委朱其昂，朱其詔昆季至滬，籌劃資本，購買輪船，擇定航線，在十二弓十六日正式開局。最初之數年中，局輪爲數雖少，但航線甚長，當以上海爲中心，東行神戶，長畸，南往香港，汕頭，北去天津，大沽。原在吾國經營輪運之英商太古，怡和及美商旗昌諸洋行，忌之甚深，一再跌似以事競爭，一度本局幾難維持，幸李傅相規定漕米必須用局輪儎遝，方得安渡危機。旗昌洋行以跌價過甚賠累至巨無法縱續，於光緒三年將其全部產業包括輪船，介庫等售與本局，自此招商局聲勢日壯，此時期之主持人，初有朱其昂氏昆仲，繼有盛宣懷，唐廷樞，徐潤，在李傳相鴻章之　籌碩畫，知人善任之領導下，辛苦經營，盡瘁局務，招商局乃得奠定基礎。</p>
<p>（二）發展時期（一八八四一一九○○）</p>
<p>中法海上糾紛起後，局輪無法行駛，曾一度與旗昌洋行訂定合同，將各棧船售與該行代爲經營，未幾戰息，仍行收回，本時期前後包括十六年，初因與太古怡和兩洋行訂有齊價合同，故營業順利；乃添置新輪，修理舊輪，購建倉庫碼頭達吾國通航各地，同時投資興辦中國通商銀行，開採唐山，萍鄕，東流等煤鑛，局務發展，與日仝增。遜淸政府以木局自開辦來，艱苦維持，辦理運兵運遭等務，均能迅妥，曾訂獎勵辦法如免除北洋出口稅二成，減收運茶稅，增給運漕水脚等，皆足使本局奮發前進者也。本期之主持人，除庸廷樞氏逝世外，局務大都由盛宣懷督辦及馬建忠，謝家福，沈能虎，顧肇熙諸會辦一同負責。</p>
<p>（三）衰退時期（一九○——一九一一）</p>
<p>本局惟一創辦人李鴻章氏以磋商辛丑和約，心力交瘁，於光緒廿七年（一九○一）病逝北京，袁世凱任北洋大臣，派楊士琦來局任總理，盛宣懷一度引退；股東大會召開於宣統元年，產生董事會，盛宣懷氏等九人被推爲首任　事，然是時値各地革命謠言紛起，淸廷派局輪裝兵運糧，差事頻繁，又因當順，海琛，協和等輪相繼失事沉沒，雖在宣統元年改隸郵傳部管轄，新訂規章以事整頓，無奈國家多事，難期振作，洎民國成立，本局則以歷年賠累至鉅，舉債數百萬兩矣。</p>
<p>（四）中興時期（一九一二—一九二七）</p>
<p>民國成立以後，適逢全國豐收，各地土貨，均急待運，營業因而增進，除民元添置江華輪外，他輪均加大修。新董事會成立，楊士琦，盛宣懷被推爲正副會長，設立主船，營業，會計三科，以董事唐德熙，陳猷，施亦爵三人分任科長，民三復成立積餘產業公司將本局與航業無關之產業　歸經營。盛宣懷氏於民五春間，因病長逝，盛氏在職三十餘年，悉心擘劃，慘淡經營，其功實不可沒也。</p>
<p>本期中段適逢歐戰，外輪西返，本局幾爲中國惟一航運機構，營業鼎盛，自可想見，及歐戰結束，局輪亦由廿六艘增至卅九艘，同時建購修理倉庫，碼頭，市房等，創設招商公學以便利局員子弟肄業。</p>
<p>本期先有盛宣懷，楊士琦，主持局務，後有孫寳琦，李國杰，盛重頤等負責經營，除期末零亂情形外，實爲本局之中興時期。</p>
<p>（五）改革時期（一九二七—一九三七）</p>
<p>國民革命軍北伐克武漢後，即擬整頓本局局務，楊銓奉令來「辦理招商局事宜」。政府奠都南京，派張靜江等十一人組織「淸査整理招商局委員會」，審査會計賬目，調査營業情况，關於購煤，租船，內河局等均有詳細淸査。十七年，本局正式改組，部派趙鐵橋氏為總辦，趙氏抵局後，即從事大加改革，創辦航海學校，辭退外籍船員，取消積餘公司，改良會計制度，惜於十九年七月廿四日，被　徒狙擊。竟以身殉。趙氏旣逝，部派蔡培爲總辦，未久又派陳希曾繼任，在職時期均極短暫。</p>
<p>廿一年十一月，行政院頒令改本局爲國營，股票由中央銀行作價收回，任劉鴻生氏爲首任總經理，劉氏在職三年，曾借庚款添置海元，海亨，海利，海貞四輪，且整頓局務，不遺餘力。劉辭職後，部派蔡增基氏爲總經理。</p>
<p>（六）抗戰時期（一九三七—一九四五）抗戰事發，本局一部份人員隨國府西上，經漢而渝，組長江業務管現處負責內河航運，蔡前總經理則率領另一部份人員遷港設辦事處，未幾該地淪陷，原有檔案賬册，大多在港喪失，各項江海輪船，除元亨利貞四輸出售英商怡和及江順等六大江輪及小輪七艘勉强駛入四川外，其他皆爲應徵塞港，或被敵機炸沉，成爲敵人擄走，損失慘重</p>
<p>三十二年春竹養甫氏爲交通部長，以戰時軍運亟須加强，戰後復興亦待規劃，局務不能中斷，即令本局在渝恢復辦公，派徐學禹氏爲總經理，於是坏四月二十六日正式復局，徐氏到任後，一方面派小輪七艘輔助川江水運，一方面將六大江輪一一修復，幷將輪上員工，仍予留用，以資維繫，是以日寇投降後，本局立即負起長江軍公復員運輸，皆事先策劃有方有以致之也。</p>
<p>（七）現在情况（一九四五—一九四七）</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，本局人員於三十四年九月初先後來滬，在總經理徐學禹並副總經理沈仲毅，胡時淵，韋煥章共同策劃　導下，兩年餘來，舉辦及革新之局務極多，茲分爲八大項簡述如次：</p>
<p>（甲）接收敵僞航產暨美加船雙—復原時奉令所接收之敵為杭產（包括船隻及房地產等）除一部份國家航運必需者經向中信局洽購外，其他均交換該局或代為船隻，到滬並經接收船舶總噸位○六艘，故現在本局船舶總噸位大三二六，八○○噸</p>
<p>（乙）負責復員水運—勝利後各地匪亂未平，本局船隻十之七八撥充軍運，餘者多供接運川贛米糧，台北之糖，米，靑島等地之鹽，並遣送日僑回國，協運公敎人員及流亡義民還鄕之用。</p>
<p>（丙）淸償舊—戰前因與列强競爭航業，維持局面，歷次向中外各銀行借款，致全部局產抵押殆盡。經兩年來之積極淸還，現已全部償淸矣。</p>
<p>（丁）船舶及碼頭，棧房之修理—各項船舶因過於破舊，或不適應用，均須予以修理，八年烽火，各地局屋，碼頭等被燬奇重，亦經分別緩急，次第修復。</p>
<p>（戊）革除舊習—改船上茶房之稱呼爲服務生，實行調訓，嚴厲取締收取小費，碼頭之包工，貼力，均經取消，改爲自辦扛力，樹立新風氣。</p>
<p>（己）擴充航線—除派專輪定期行駛長江，南洋，北洋三線而外，增設海外線，派輪至印度，菲島，暹　，緬甸，藉利易貨，而增國光。</p>
<p>（庚）爲便利客　運　，增設服務委員會，在碼頭設招待所以利旅客候輪，辦現接送旅客卡車，及浦江運　輪渡。</p>
<p>（辛）投資創設中國油輪公司，台灣航業公司，並與民營航業密切聯繫，互收合作之效。</p>
<p>今以後，將爲中國航業振興時期，因航權收回以後，航業發展機會較佳，而所負責任亦愈大，「自强不息」，唯吾航業同人，其共勉之。</p>
<h3>乘船在今日</h3>
<p>— 徐逸</p>
<p>勝利二年多了，飄揚着國旗的船隻早已負起了戰後國內航運的重任，但提起「乘船」，恐怕你仍會想到，碼頭上的混雜，買票的困難，船上茶房的傲慢，和種種惡習陋規的猖獗，這種長夜惡夢的餘悸，不能不使你發生寸步難行的感想。</p>
<p>最近你也許又會乘船，假使乘的是今日招商局的船，我相信你一定會發生一種不同的感想—一種在今日環境中使你稍覺安慰的感想。</p>
<p>說起買船票的困難，已往是太多，太可怕了，雖然船少乘客多是最大的原因，但招商局在忙於復員的時候，延遲了這一方面管理的改善，是無可否認的事實，在今日當你踏進他們的售票處，看見的雖然依舊是川流不息的客人，但在那裏已沒有你意料中的擠軋和混亂，經過改裝過的售票處，確是顯得寬敞和便利，當你在壁上掛着的客位牌上見到還有空餘的話，你就可以很快地買到你的船票，假使你來遲了，在問訊處裹的小姐們會請你留下你的住址，替你登記下一班的船票，她們會不厭其詳地解答你的疑問和誠　地帮助解决你的困難，不必說，在那裏黑市票是决不會存在的。</p>
<p>在招商局的碼頭上，往日困擾的黑幕和混亂的情况，也都切實的加以整頓了，他們更進一步的在碼頭上設立了旅客招待所，佈置得整潔大方，剛從船上下來的乘客找一個幽靜的地方來恢復旅途勞頓的需要眞是太迫切了，碼頭上的候船客人也同樣需要一處歇息和遮風避雨的地方，假使你有充裕的時間，船還沒有啓椗的話，你和你的親友們也可以到那裏去坐上一會兒，用些熱的茶點，那裏有播音器會隨時報吿你開船的時間，當你付帳時，你準會發現所付的代價還比你想像中的要便宜多多呢。</p>
<p>在船上你最怕見的恐怕就是你從前慣見的傲慢的「茶房」吧，好了，現在接待着你的已是一班經過嚴格訓練的「服務生』，週到，謙和，他們知道怎樣照顧着年長和年幼的乘客們上船，怎樣使你感到舒適和滿意。</p>
<p>船上的「吃」，也許是你最關心的一點了，現在招商局指派負責船上餐務的是一位曾經留學英國的餐務專家，他曾經很坦白的承認不能使船上的菜餚適合着每一個乘客的口味，但他在努力做到「淸潔」「營養」和「可口」三點，你再有嘗試的機會時，你决不會失望，而認他的話爲不兌現的支票。</p>
<p>當你在甲板上望着又長又大的海面江岸時，你不免要感到一陣莫名的岑寂，也許你會感到需要一些消磨時間的娛樂，當然在今日招商局的船上，像賭博一類的事，已是懸　為例了，但你可以找到你所喜歡的書報和雜誌，在有幾艘輪船上，已裝了廣播設備，轉播各項重要新聞，船舶動態，和悅耳的音樂，當你一卷在手，靜聆着美歌名曲時，你會相信你是在船上嗎？一艘中國的船上嗎？</p>
<p>你的健康和安全，也正是他們所關心的，雖然現在招商局的船上，還沒有像醫院的醫藥設備，但是在一個短期航程中，旅客所需要的救急藥品，已都置備得很完全了。</p>
<p>你的舒適和滿意，不論你住的是頭等或者四等艙，都是招商局的各主管部門日夜殫精竭慮在設法改善的目標，在他們努力的過程中，他們遭遇者的困難，是艱鉅的，現在的客船仍是那樣的少，物力又是那樣的艱難，假使我們體認現實和不事苛求的話，他們這樣的成績，自是值得　揚的，但要幫助他們達到更完美的前途，恐怕還需要着我們更大的協助和策勵吧。</p>
<p>編餘</p>
<p>（一）這一張特刋爲使讀者們明瞭一些關於國營招商局的過去現在和將來，所以所有的資料，多是關於事實的報導。</p>
<p>（二）除本報以外，在今天的商報裏，也有同樣的特刋，可是內容完全不同，要目如國營招商局淸償債款始末記，談談現在的客遝業務情形，六大江輪修理經過，我在招商局服務四十八年的回憶，國營招商局現有船隻一覽表等，請讀者注意。</p>
<p>（三）希望讀者給我們以匡正和指敎。</p>

        <h1>1947.12.16</h1>
<h3>Draft Peace Treaty Review Completed: Our Country Still Advocates Lenience Towards Japan, Clarifies Attitude on Ryukyu Sovereignty</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] The foreign ministry's preparatory work regarding a peace treaty with Japan, which began at the end of the War of Resistance, has been largely completed after years of careful and precise handling. All issues have been thoroughly considered and resolved after multiple meetings of responsible officials of the ministry and the Peace Treaty Review Committee, as well as written opinions from experts and scholars nationwide. The entire work is nearing completion, but the Review Committee will continue to exist to convene meetings and provide consultation as needed. According to an authoritative source speaking to our reporter, the satisfactory completion of this task is a great achievement. The draft treaty encompasses all important issues, not only representing our country's views on peace terms but also resolving issues based on the human principles of safeguarding world peace, punishing the guilty, and eliminating hatred. It can be presented as the most reasonable basis for discussion when a peace conference with Japan is convened in the future. According to our reporter, the result of the Peace Treaty Review Committee's participation has led to changes in some issues after careful consideration. The territorial provisions have confirmed our claim to the Ryukyu Islands. This has already been reported to the Political Consultative Council last month by President Zhang Qun. In addition, it is appropriate for Japan's South Sea islands to be placed under trusteeship. In the political provisions, the proposals for various educational measures and ideological reforms to eradicate its aggressive spirit have been unanimously confirmed, and it is stipulated that the martial tradition be eliminated from its social organization. The identity of the current Emperor and his relationship with the war must be assessed based on facts and legal principles. The duties and titles of his future successor should also be reconsidered. In the reparations section, the level of retained industry has adopted a standard based on a time limit, possibly the standard of the three years after 1930. However, our country does not intend to compromise on the types of retained industry. Any industry that can be directly or indirectly used for military production must be dismantled. Our country's percentage of reparations claimed should not be less than 48%. The "construction" carried out in overseas occupied areas by forcibly compelling the local people to shed blood and sweat in order to consolidate the occupation and strengthen aggression, as well as all loans containing aggressive intent, cannot be recognized as its overseas assets and must be regarded as the wealth of the people in those regions.</p>
<h3>Equipment Obtained by the Soviet Union from the Northeast Should Be Deducted from Reparations</h3>
<p>As for the assets and industrial equipment removed from our Northeast by the Soviet Union, they cannot be regarded as "spoils of war" obtained from Japan and should be deducted from the amount of Japanese reparations it is entitled to, as fair compensation. As for the military provisions, we still insist on the disarmament of all its forces and restrict any future development beyond maintaining domestic order and security. In addition, regarding the implementation of the peace treaty after it is signed, our country still insists that there must be some form of certification. Military occupation may be discussed at length due to practical difficulties, but civil administration supervision must not be abolished. In summary, the draft peace treaty with Japan that our country has finally decided on and intends to submit to the peace conference may be more lenient in some respects than originally anticipated. This is the result of the majority of experts considering the facts, and Foreign Minister Wang's impressions from his visit to Japan also carry significant weight. After returning to the country, Wang publicly declared that Katayama and his cabinet do have the desire to lead Japan onto a path of democracy and peace, and have already shown some signs of it. Wang also sympathizes with the general suffering of the Japanese people. An authoritative source further emphasized that our country has no vengeful motives in dealing with the Japanese issue, only seeking to ensure that they thoroughly repent of their past mistakes and contribute to the Far East and the world.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] After Britain, following the Soviet Union, also rejected our proposal for a preparatory meeting for a peace conference with Japan, the capital felt quite regretful. Note: Our country's proposal was to accommodate the main parts of the discrimination between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, in order to seek a compromise between the two sides, but it was rejected by both sides one after another, inevitably feeling embarrassed. However, China's desire for an early convocation of a peace conference with Japan has not been abandoned and has become even more urgent because the preparation of the draft peace treaty with Japan is nearing the final decision stage, and the time to legally end the war cannot be further delayed. According to official sources: the United States has not yet responded to our proposal. However, they did not comment on whether our country will wait for a decision from the United States or immediately strive for US cooperation as a final effort to break the deadlock.</p>
<h3>White House Holds Meeting to Review Foreign Aid Plan, $16.5 Billion Needed Over Four Years</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman met with Congressional leaders from both parties for eighteen minutes today. Afterwards, Republican Senator Vandenberg said: The President hopes to submit the long-term Marshall Plan for European aid before Congress adjourns the special session on Friday. He also said: He had asked the leaders of both parties about the timing of the adjournment of the Congressional special session, and they told him that both houses hope to adjourn on Friday. Fan did not reveal when the President's message would be submitted. Truman also did not reveal the content of the message, presumably because the meeting time was too short.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] President Truman invited Congressional leaders to the White House on the 15th to review the government's long-term plan to assist Western European reconstruction, which would require a total of US$16.5 billion over four years. After the invited guests discussed the overall foreign situation with the President, they returned to Congress. The Senate will take swift action to pass the temporary aid bill of $597 million for France, Italy, Austria, and China. According to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: This emergency aid bill represents a compromise solution for the relief program between the Senate and the House of Representatives, and it should be passed by both houses today and sent to the President for signature. However, it is rumored that the House Appropriations Committee may recommend a reduction of $50 million to $100 million or more. Regarding Marshall's long-term relief plan, the President seems to want to know the opinions of the Republican and Democratic leaders first, and resolutely insisted that Congressional members first pass a four-year plan, and the annual appropriations could be decided by Congress.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] It is reported that a powerful group on the House Appropriations Committee still intends to reduce the $597 million stipulated in the Foreign Aid Bill, and there is a concern that the China portion may also be deleted. It is currently heard that a draft has been agreed upon, stipulating that: the China portion will not be included in the emergency relief bill, and the relief funds for France, Italy, and Austria will be reduced by $50 million to $60 million. What remains to be discussed is whether the $60 million originally intended to aid that country will also be deleted now that the China portion has been deleted. The Appropriations Committee group discussed this matter in strict secrecy and is scheduled to continue the meeting on the 15th. Once an agreement is reached, it will be submitted to the full Appropriations Committee for review. However, since the head of the group and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee are both Republican Congressman Taylor, what the group decides will definitely be approved by the full Appropriations Committee.</p>
<h3>Guo Dehua Flies to Hong Kong Today to Discuss Continued Negotiations on the Kowloon Walled City Incident</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, came to Shanghai after seeking instructions in Beijing regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident. He is scheduled to fly to Hong Kong this morning to continue negotiations with the Hong Kong authorities on the Kowloon Walled City incident.</p>
<h3>Chen Qitian Returns to Nanjing, Talks About Impressions of Trip to Jinan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Economic Minister Chen Qitian returned to Nanjing by train from Jinan on the 15th and spoke to reporters on the train about his impressions of his trip to Jinan. Chen said: I went to Jinan this time at the invitation to attend the opening ceremony of the Puji Railway and to inspect the coal production, coal transportation, and industrial and commercial conditions in Jinan along the Jinpu Railway. Jinan is an isolated city with its transportation cut off on all sides for a long time. It is rare that the Shandong military and political authorities and the people have worked together to support it until now. While in Jinan, I met with the Shandong military and political authorities and business leaders many times and inspected several power plants, textile mills, and flour mills. I deeply felt that all parties were able to work hard in a practical manner, which is admirable. However, in order to permanently protect Jinan, it is necessary to quickly restore the entire province of Shandong. In order to quickly restore the entire province of Shandong, in addition to having sufficient National Army to suppress the bandits, it is also necessary to expand the local security forces. The character of the people of Shandong is most suitable for military requirements. If more troops composed of the people of Shandong are added, it will not only benefit Shandong Province but also the entire country. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>Party, Government, and Military Circles in Peiping Welcome Fu Zuoyi, Fu Emphasizes Military-Political Coordination</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch on the 15th] Fu Zuoyi gave a speech at a welcome meeting held by all sectors in Peiping today, emphasizing military-political coordination and implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood in order to overcome the current difficult situation. The welcome meeting was held in conjunction with the expanded memorial week of the municipal party headquarters, presided over by Li Zongren. All party, government, and military leaders in Peiping participated. Li Zongren first gave a speech, saying that he believed that Fu would be able to complete the heavy task of suppressing bandits in the five provinces of North China with his hard-working style. Then, Fu stepped onto the podium amidst thunderous applause. Fu said that although the situation is grim, after many analyses, he firmly believes that the communists will eventually fail. He listed five points to prove this conclusion: the implementation of democratic constitutionalism will help suppress the rebellion; people who previously believed that the communist problem could be resolved peacefully have now realized this and are helping the government suppress the rebellion; the people in the government's peaceful and free areas have already tasted the horrors of war caused by the communists, and we should implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and reform politics to relieve the people; the communists rule the people entirely through terror policies, and the hatred is deep-seated, and the people will rise up in resistance because of the National Army's rescue; During the recent inspection, I learned that the tactics, strategies, and military discipline of the various units in dealing with the communists have improved. Finally, Fu said: In today's situation, the problem cannot be solved by the military alone. Military-political coordination is necessary, with the military covering politics and politics covering the economy in order to achieve success. The phenomenon of joining the party to become an official in the past will no longer be seen today.</p>
<h3>Chu Xichun to Head Hebei Province</h3>
<p>Approval Possible at Today's Executive Yuan Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] The central government has recently decided to appoint Chu Xichun as the chairman of Hebei Province. This case will be approved at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 16th. (Note: This decision was passed by the Central Political Committee held today).</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch on the 15th] The chairman of Hebei has been confirmed as Chu Xichun, who will be announced after being approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 16th. Chu will also concurrently serve as the deputy commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in North China. This morning, Fu and Chu jointly visited Zhang Yinwu, Zhang Bojin, and other important local figures in Hebei to seek their opinions.</p>
<h3>Northeast Headquarters Convene Military Review Meeting, Fierce Fighting Breaks Out on All Fronts in Western Liaoning</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 15th] The Northeast Headquarters convened a military review meeting on the 15th, with generals above the division commander level from various fronts coming to Shenyang to participate. The meeting will last for two days. At today's meeting, Luo Zhuoying presided over the meeting and listened to reports from various units. Pan Yukun, commander of the New First Army, arrived in Shenyang yesterday to participate in the meeting.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The situation on the Guanjie section of the North Liao Line is becoming increasingly tense. A part of the bandit's Eighth Column captured Beizhen City, a major pear-producing area in western Liaoning, on the night of the 14th. Beizhen is a militarily important area, 25 kilometers southeast of Goubangzi Station. Another unit attacked Luyangyi, 15 kilometers west of Goubangzi, with fierce fighting throughout the night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 15th] The Northeastern war, which had been silent for almost a month, has now entered a new stage due to the bandit's Eighth and Ninth Columns harassing western Liaoning again. The bandit's Eighth Column, from the Rehe-Liaoning border area, passed through the Songling Bianmen (about 30 kilometers northwest of Jinzhou), Xuejiatun (5 kilometers north of Jinzhou), and other places, directly harassing the Shuangyangdian and Dalinghe stations on the Beining Qian Line, attempting to disrupt railway traffic. The National Army is currently intercepting in separate directions, and fierce battles have broken out along the railway line. The main force of the bandit's Ninth Column has not made any rash moves in the Songling Bianmen area. There has been no major contact in northern Liaoning, and the communist troops are moving frequently. Its First Column has moved to Xifeng, and the Third Column has moved south from Xi'an, with unclear intentions. The bandit's Second Column on the west side of the Middle-Long Line has also moved to the vicinity of Bamiancheng. The local National Army, in order to control the enemy first, has dispatched troops in separate directions to suppress them. Since the recovery of Haicheng Dashiqiao in southern Liaoning, that area has been consolidated. However, the bandit army southeast of Liaoyang has recently attempted to move again. The National Army has made strict deployments in response to this, and if the bandits invade, they will suffer a serious blow.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Fierce fighting has broken out in various parts of western Liaoning under the frozen sky: The bandit's Eighth Column, 22nd Division, and other units that attacked Erdaohuzi (north of Jinzhou) and Shuangyangdian (northeast of Jinzhou) have been severely defeated by the National Army, and the bandit forces have been frustrated. The 23rd and 24th Divisions of the bandit's Eighth Column crossed the Daling River and fled east. The Daling River Station is being firmly defended by the National Army, and a group of them attacked Beizhen (north of Goubangzi) and Shishan Station on the 14th, engaging in fierce fighting with the defending troops.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] About 7,000 communists crossed the Liao River from the Liao River Estuary on the 14th and attacked Faku in separate directions this morning. The defending troops fought back bravely and are currently in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Zhang Ji Passed Away in Nanjing Yesterday</p>
<p>Died Suddenly from Angina Pectoris at the Age of 77</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Emergency Dispatch on the 16th at 2 AM] National Government Member Zhang Ji suddenly suffered from angina pectoris on the evening of the 15th and passed away at his private residence in Houzai Lane at 11:30 PM. After Zhang's sudden illness, his family immediately notified Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan. Yu immediately went to Zhang's residence with doctors, but Zhang had already lost consciousness when they knocked on the door and died before they could be treated. Zhang's wife, Ms. Cui Zhenhua, is currently in Peiping. President Yu telegraphed Zhang's wife to report the death that night. Zhang's courtesy name was Puquan, and he was from Cang County, Hebei. He was 77 years old. (Image: Zhang Ji's posthumous portrait)</p>
<h3>Huang'an City Continued to be Recovered in Eastern Hubei, Bandits Attacking Lanfeng Station in Eastern Henan Repelled, Fangcheng Tongbai Biyang Recovered in Western Henan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] A certain unit of the National Army recovered Huang'an City on the morning of the 14th and is clearing out the remaining bandits in the vicinity.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Liu Bocheng's bandit troops suffered setbacks on all fronts on the 14th. The remnants of his Second Column, the 5th and 6th Brigades, were defeated while fleeing from the Gushi area. At 4:00 PM on the 14th, they were defeated at Guliudian, east of Liuan. The bandits suffered 553 casualties. His First Column was attacked by the National Army's advancing force and moved north between Zhaihe and Huangchuan on the evening of the 14th. Its vanguard, about two regiments, appeared to be crossing the Huai River at 2:00 PM on the 15th; his Third Column was completely defeated by all routes of the National Army in the Baiquanyuan area southeast of Guangshan from 2:00 PM on the 14th, killing 688, wounding 691, and capturing 60 bandits, seizing many supplies.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 15th] The National Army in southern Henan is stepping up its suppression. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops, who fled north from Gushi, must cross the Huai River, pass through Sanhejian into Yingshang territory, and Fengtai is in dire straits. Another group arrived west of Linquan and have become roaming bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hefei, 15th] Liu's First Column has suffered heavy losses after being attacked by the National Army in successive joint attacks from various routes. On the evening of the 14th, it fled north from the area between Zhaihe and Huangchuan.

<h3>Communist Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Repeatedly Defeated</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 15th] Official News: Rugao County belongs to Qu You and is the National Army's coastal defense corridor. At the beginning of this month, it was besieged for ten days by communist bandits with a force of four regiments and about 10,000 local militia. After Commander Li heard the news, he dispatched crack troops, braving the rain to provide assistance. They finally arrived a few days ago and completely defeated the bandits, killing countless bandits and seizing many light and heavy weapons. The bandits concentrated about 3,000 people from the new first, second, and third detachments of the Huaihai Military Region, as well as the Dulai Battalion of the Dushusi, and other units, and harassed Shuyang a few days ago. The Guanhai National Army encircled and suppressed them in two directions, broke into the core, and defeated the bandits. The remnants fled to Ciji and Lirenji. In this battle, more than 300 people, including the commander of the third detachment of the bandits, Wu Lin, and the commander of the Dulai battalion, were killed or wounded, and more than 200 rifles and machine guns were seized. The old fourth regiment of the bandits, the Xinghua Regiment, the Zhituan Independent Regiment, and the sixth regiment of the second army, totaling about 3,000 people, with many cannons attached, besieged the two strongholds of Dadao and Zhuhonggang southeast of Xinghua County a few days ago.

<p>Legislative Yuan Convenes Subcommittee to Review the Organization Laws of the Five Yuan and the Preliminary Draft of the Organization Law of the Presidential Office</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] The organization laws of the five yuan are currently being reviewed by a subcommittee convened by the Legislative Yuan. The organization law of the Legislative Yuan has now been amended, and the entire work will be completed before the end of this month, and then submitted to the State Council for discussion. It is learned that the organization of the Legislative Yuan stipulates that the number of people attending the meeting must be one-third, that is, if the number is less than one-third, the meeting cannot be held, but it has now been changed to one-fifth, because the total number of new legislators is as many as 773. If one-third is counted, there will be more than 200 people, which is more difficult to convene and hold a meeting, so it is changed to one-fifth. In addition, the Legislative Yuan's various committees have added special committee members, mostly serving legislators. The organization of the Control Yuan will not undergo major changes. Only the retention or abolition of the Supervisory Envoy's Office is still under study. Because the Constitution stipulates its abolition, and it is currently needed in reality, all parties are requesting its restoration. Regarding the Judicial Yuan section, the current Supreme Court is cancelled according to the Constitution. Under the Judicial Yuan, there are civil and criminal chambers, and the chamber director is concurrently held by the President of the Yuan. Some people believe that it is not appropriate for the great power to be concentrated in the President of the Yuan and advocate maintaining the original proposal. Regarding the Executive Yuan section, there may not be any changes, but the Information Bureau will be included in the formal organization of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 15th] The organization law of the Presidential Office has been drafted after several meetings of the Civil Service Office of the National Government and the designation of a person responsible for drafting the articles. It is learned that the regulations have been initially finalized and are being studied by the Civil Service Office.

It is reported that Mr. Feng has investigated the actual circumstances of the case in Hong Kong and believes that the incident was purely due to negligence.

<h3>Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Today marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This newspaper, having the same vintage as the company, cannot help but offer a few words of congratulations on this grand occasion. The past 75 years have indeed been a very important period in Chinese history. Due to the incompetence of the Qing Dynasty, the powers intensified their aggression against China step by step, until it was impossible to close the country off. Thus, the doors were opened wide, even to the brink of partition. Due to contact with the powers, this politically stirred up the high tide of the National Revolution. Relying on the successive sacrifices of the martyrs, the Qing Dynasty was finally overthrown, and the Republic of China was established. This in turn triggered the invasion of Japanese warlords, culminating in the full-scale War of Resistance and the victorious end of the war. In economic and cultural terms, we gradually realized that we could not stick to old ways and that we must learn from the West's strong armor and sharp weapons, promote science, and devote ourselves to the establishment of domestic heavy industry and modern transportation. At the same time, we must enlighten the people and improve the general level of knowledge of the masses. Only by advancing on both fronts can China join the ranks of modern, prosperous, and strong nations. Both the Shen Bao and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were founded under this call. The 75th anniversary of this newspaper was not long ago, and now we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. As "contemporaries," we would like to offer our heartfelt congratulations here.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the past 75 years cannot but fill us with many feelings. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was founded at the same time as the Nippon Yusen Kaisha. Before the war, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha had more than 150 ships with a total tonnage of over one million tons, and its routes spanned the globe. It was listed as a world-class shipping institution. Our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, on the other hand, clung to the old and neglected the new. Not only did it not have any new developments, but the courage and ambition of its founding had also waned, and it had completely turned into a dilapidated household. When the Chinese people saw the contrast between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha at that time, everyone couldn't help but sigh. However, the reasons for the decline of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were not simple. The existence of unequal treaties meant that even the shipping within China's territorial waters was controlled by the powers, which was, of course, a fatal blow to the development of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Mismanagement also cannot be excused. Due to these multiple reasons, the development of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was frustrated everywhere. Today, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, there are a few points that we seem to cannot help but put forward first: During the War of Resistance and after the victory, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company devoted its limited ships to military transportation and reconstruction work, which can be said to have done its best for the country and the nation. Since Mr. Xu Xueyu took over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has been determined to reorganize its operations. Not only has he cleared old debts, but he has also added new ships and devoted himself to the expansion of long-distance routes, which has given the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company a new life. Today, on the 75th anniversary of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, when the company is experiencing a new life, we are mindful of the painful past and look forward to the future, and we would like to offer a few more words:</p>
<p>First, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as a state-owned shipping institution, currently has a very low tonnage. Not only does it not have the one million tons of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha before the war, but it is also quite far from half of that, 500,000 tons. Our shipping industry is still very, very far from our ideal. Now that Japan has been defeated, its former position in the Eastern and even world shipping industry should be given to our country. However, with our country's current merchant ship tonnage, it is really not enough to shoulder this mission. The government should promptly submit a proposal to the relevant parties to grant at least one-third of the total tonnage of Japan's existing merchant ships to China as part of the compensation. China is also a belligerent country against Germany and Italy, and part of the merchant ships of Germany and Italy should also be handed over to our country.</p>
<p>Second, we should actively establish our shipbuilding industry. Our country's shipbuilding industry began in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Mawei Shipyard and the Jiangnan Shipyard both enjoyed a temporary reputation, but they then declined. Today, our shipbuilding industry does not even have the original foundation. Without the establishment of a shipbuilding industry, the development of the shipping industry will have inherent limitations. We can certainly purchase ships from abroad in peacetime, but this will not only consume foreign exchange, but may also be affected by war once it occurs. If we want to develop the shipping industry, we must establish our own shipbuilding industry. The shipbuilding industry is a heavy industry and should be state-owned in accordance with the economic policy of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we hope that the government can pay attention to this and establish our shipbuilding industry as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Third, from a national defense perspective, the merchant ship fleet is an indispensable part of national defense. Needless to say, the merchant ship fleet can participate in naval service during wartime and become a part of the navy. Even if it does not directly participate in the war, the transportation, guard, and other services it can undertake are directly or indirectly related to national defense. Now that we are committed to rebuilding our navy to defend our seas, we must not ignore the establishment of a merchant ship fleet. The United Kingdom, which is known for its navy, uses its merchant ship fleet as its Merchant Navy. Our country's current conditions for establishing a strong navy seem to be insufficient, so how to expand the tonnage of our merchant ship fleet, the government should give the greatest assistance to the shipping industry.</p>
<p>Finally, from an economic point of view, the operation of long-distance routes is an important tool for developing foreign trade. In today's situation of extremely difficult foreign exchange, self-transportation and self-sales are even more important. In the past, the imbalance in the balance of payments, the excess of imports was certainly a major reason, but the amount of expenditure on freight was also quite alarming. According to reports, our country sold surplus scrap steel to American steel mills this time, and the freight alone accounted for US$18 million. It can be seen that in international trade, if there is no overseas shipping line operated by ourselves, the amount of foreign exchange consumed is really considerable. Now that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has opened up long-distance routes, we hope that due to the increase in tonnage in the future, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can further expand its overseas shipping lines to win our overseas markets and help the development of our national economy.</p>
<h3>Chen Qitian Talks About His Impressions of Visiting Jinan</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Shandong's position in the country is important from a military, political, transportation, and cultural point of view, and the central government should continue to pay attention to it. The most urgent task at present is to strengthen military strength and eliminate the remaining bandits in order to restore transportation and develop industry. Shandong is rich in minerals such as coal, iron, and gold, and agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, peanuts, and tobacco. The table-style industry also has a considerable foundation, but at the moment, because the railways, mines, and factories have been destroyed by the communists, the output of various products has been greatly reduced. Even the existing small amount of various products is not easy to transport to the places where they are needed. For example, Shandong's coal production is so high that it can be used for the whole country, but the Jinan power plant has been shut down for several months due to traffic congestion and insufficient coal transportation. To fundamentally solve the problem of coal consumption in Jinan, the Jiaoji Railway must be repaired as soon as possible so that Zibo coal can be transported to Jinan in large quantities by rail. The current method of relief is to transport coal from Lincheng and Xuzhou. As for the coal production and storage of the mines along the Jinpu and Jiaoji lines, the situation is as follows: The Huainan Mine in the Huainan District produces 90,000 tons per month and has 35,000 tons in storage. The Huadong Mine in the Jiayong District produces 60,000 tons per month and has 30,000 tons in storage. The above two mines are fully equipped. The Zhongxing Mine in the Linyi District produces 33,000 tons per month and has 42,000 tons in storage. The Xintai Mine in the Xinlai District produces only 1,000 tons per month. The Huaxian Mine in the Taining District also produces only 1,500 tons per month. The machinery of the above three mines has been completely destroyed, and they are currently mined by indigenous methods. The machinery of the Zibo Mine in the Zibo District has also been half-destroyed, producing 20,000 tons per month and storing 25,000 tons. The Fangzi Mine in the Weixian District is mostly fully equipped and produces 10,000 tons per month. The mines in the Zhangqiu District have been completely destroyed and have no production. According to the above statistics, the monthly coal production in Shandong Province is about 108,000 tons, and the coal reserves are about 132,000 tons. In order to prevent coal shortages in various places, we are currently trying to transport the coal reserves of various mines to Beijing, Shanghai, and Jinan. In addition to requesting the railway bureau to allocate three special coal transportation trains to transport coal to Beijing and Shanghai, it is planned to transport about 36,000 tons of Zhongxing coal from Lincheng to the south, and about 6,000 tons to the north. In addition, 5,000 tons of Huadong coal will be transported from Xuzhou to the Jinan power plant. All the mines along the Jinpu and Jiaoji lines, except for Huainan, Huadong, and Fangzi, have been almost completely destroyed by the communists. This kind of destruction not only directly kills the people within the mining area, but also indirectly starves the people outside the mining area, which is really heartbreaking. The reason why the Shandong communists have been able to destroy and disrupt again and again is said to be that they have been receiving a steady stream of Japanese-made guns from the Northeast across the sea. This proves that the communist rebellion is not only a domestic war, but also has international implications. If it is not put out as soon as possible, it will not be easy for China to achieve peace and democracy, and the whole world will be difficult to obtain peace.</p>
<h3>Macao Authorities Order a Ban on Gold Imports and Exports</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th] The Portuguese authorities in Macao have ordered a ban on the import, export, and transit of gold and platinum. Hereafter, the transfer of these precious metals will require a special permit, with a limit of 50,000 ounces of gold and 20,000 ounces of platinum per application, and subject to taxation. The same applies to transit gold. The Macao authorities stated that the continued free movement of these precious metals would inevitably have an adverse impact on Macao's economy, so the promulgation of restrictive measures was unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Customs Cracks Down on Smuggling; Outskirts of Macao to be Blockaded</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th] According to Zhang Yongnian, the customs officer of the Guangdong Customs, who is about to be transferred to the Jianghai Customs, the center of smuggling in South China has shifted from Macao. Smugglers in the Zhongshan area have reached an unprecedented level of rampant activity. The main export smuggling is rice. The customs has now decided to blockade the outskirts of Macao to cut off the smuggling route. In addition, smuggling in the Dongjiang area has recently been slightly curbed, and it is hoped that smuggling in South China will be reduced in the future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] From the 5th to the 9th, the Guangdong Customs seized a total of 2,512 cases of smuggled goods by sea, land, and air, worth more than 20 billion yuan. Most of the smuggled goods were prohibited from import and export and evaded foreign exchange settlement.</p>
<h3>Price Fluctuations Seen in Various Places</h3>
<p>Wuxi [This newspaper, Wuxi, 15th] Today's prices are soaring. The price monitoring team has stationed special commissioners in the rice, flour, oil, and yarn markets to suppress prices, resulting in no market for rice, wheat, and flour. Only white japonica rice is being traded at 930,000, wheat at 900,000, flour at 360,000, and cooking oil at 1,930,000.</p>
<p>Suzhou [This newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] Suzhou rice prices are still rising. Although credit is tight, scattered households are doing their best to absorb it, and speculators are manipulating and raising prices. The market is chaotic. Although the social science department of the county government has worked hard to persuade and advise, it has not seen any effect. The price of white rice is as high as 880,000, and various rice shops are selling black market rice for 930,000 yuan. The prices of other items such as wheat, cooking oil, and sugar have also increased.</p>
<p>Nantong [This newspaper, Nantong, 15th] Although the source of rice is smooth and the stock is abundant, the price increase has not stopped. Today, japonica rice has reached 990,000 per shi, and indica rice has reached 860,000, which is higher than Shanghai and Wuxi. The source of wheat is not smooth, and flour has increased by 120,000 per bag.</p>
<p>Wuhu [This newspaper, Wuhu, 15th] The prices of rice and yarn have slightly decreased. 20-count Sando yarn is 800,000 yuan, down 50,000, and machine-milled rice is 710,000 yuan, down 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin [This newspaper, Tianjin, 15th] The Tianjin military and police authorities continue to monitor the market. On the 15th, they arrested more than 20 illegal brokers. Grain prices have fallen again, and flour has returned to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] The Tianjin branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation was officially established on the 15th. In addition to handling the transportation and sales of grain and regulating military and civilian food in the north, the company will also try to export soybeans and peanuts from North China and the Northeast in exchange for foreign exchange to purchase foreign wheat.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Shops Closing Down</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Fuzhou, 15th] The market here has been changing a lot lately. On the one hand, due to the stimulation of large denominations, prices of everything have soared. On the other hand, due to the suspension of lending by banks, credit has tightened, leading to the active participation of usurers, with high interest rates reaching 7%. Some shops cannot withstand the exploitation and have announced their closure, and the act of suspending interest and returning capital has become a trend. It is expected that the trend of closures will intensify by the end of the year. The Fuzhou Four-Bank Joint Office is studying this economic crisis and discussing remedial measures. It has decided to invite representatives from the city's industrial, commercial, and financial circles to meet tomorrow to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou's Trade Surplus Exceeds 30 Billion Last Month</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Fuzhou, 15th] According to statistics, Fuzhou's foreign trade in November reached 105,226,247,140 yuan in total exports and 73,333,690,999 yuan in imports, resulting in a surplus of 31.8 billion. Among the export goods, tea, sugar, and timber have increased sharply compared to the previous month, while paper bamboo shoots have decreased slightly. Imports are still dominated by fabrics.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Implements Currency Reform New Ruble in Circulation from Today, Exchanging Old Currency at a Rate of One to Ten Unified Prices and Abolition of the Rationing System</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] The Soviet Union has abolished the rationing system and implemented currency reform. The new ruble is scheduled to be in circulation from December 16th. The order issued by the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party states: The Soviet Union is now facing the task of reforming the currency system to strengthen the exchange rate of the ruble and abolishing the supply rationing system to expand trade. During the war, the maintenance costs of the army and the development of military industries increased rapidly. The sharp increase in expenditure required the circulation of huge amounts of currency, which was the case in all other participating countries. At the same time, the production of goods for people's consumption also decreased, and the volume of retail trade transactions decreased significantly. The purpose of currency reform is to alleviate the consequences of the world war on currency circulation and to help improve the material welfare of workers. The currency held by the people's national cooperatives and state-owned enterprises, except for auxiliary currency, will be exchanged for new currency. Furthermore, during the war, German troops and other invaders issued a large number of counterfeit ruble notes in the temporarily occupied Soviet territory, which further increased the amount of currency in circulation, exceeding what the national economy needed, thus reducing the purchasing power of the currency. Today, it has become imperative to take steps to strengthen the value of the Soviet ruble. Although under war conditions, the Soviet government was able to maintain the prices of rationed goods throughout the war due to the implementation of the rationing system for food and industrial products, the reduction in trade in consumer goods by the state and cooperatives, as well as the increase in people's demand for collective farm products, led to an increase in market prices, which exceeded fifteen times the pre-war level. Moreover, speculators accumulated large amounts of goods in an attempt to obtain windfall profits.</p>
<h3>New Currency Exchange Standards Minor Losses Suffered by Labor Seriously打击打击 Serious Blow to Profiteers</h3>
<p>The Soviet Cabinet's order then announced the detailed rules for the exchange of new currency for old rubles as follows: Bank deposits of 3,000 rubles or less will be exchanged for new currency at equal value; deposits between 3,000 and 10,000 rubles will have the first 3,000 rubles exchanged for new currency at equal value, with the remainder converted to new currency at a ratio of three to two; for deposits above 10,000 rubles, the first 3,000 rubles will be exchanged for new currency at equal value, 7,000 rubles will be converted at a ratio of three to two, and the remaining portion will be converted at a ratio of two to one. Cash on hand will be exchanged at a rate of ten old rubles for one new ruble.</p>
<p>Currency held by cooperative businesses and collective farms will be converted at a rate of five old rubles for four new rubles. Government bonds issued before 1947 will be converted at a rate of three old rubles for two new rubles and renamed Unified Bonds. For three days on December 15, 16, and 17, bank deposits will be suspended. The order also announced that the distinction between commercial prices (free market prices) and current prices (official prices) will be abolished to unify retail prices nationwide. The Ministry of Commerce will be instructed to formulate new prices for food and industrial products in accordance with the announced reform. On average, the prices of industrial products will be reduced by one-third compared to current commercial prices. The order also pointed out that the losses suffered by the majority of the working class will be short-term and minor, while profiteers will suffer the most severe blow. Although the working class will suffer losses, they can be compensated by the abolition of higher commercial prices and the reduction of current bread and grain rationing prices. However, the people must bear a significant portion of the sacrifice, which is considered to be the last sacrifice. Bread and grain prices will be reduced by 12% and 10% respectively, beer prices will be reduced by 10%, other grains will generally maintain current prices, liquor prices will remain unchanged, industrial products will be higher than rationing prices, but will be reduced by one-third compared to commercial prices. Meat, fish, fat, sugar, tobacco, candy, potatoes, and other vegetables will maintain prices equal to current rationing prices, and new prices will be set for milk and eggs.</p>
<p>The exchange of new currency is expected to be completed within two weeks starting from December 16. During the exchange period, old currency can be used at one-tenth of its face value. From a certain date, the old currency will cease to circulate. Government-issued public debt and special savings certificates will be exchanged for new currency bonds at a ratio of three to one between May 3 and July 3, 1948. The two phases of the Reconstruction Bonds issued in 1947 are not included in the exchange. The aforementioned order was signed by Stalin, the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Central Committee, Zhdanov.</p>
<h3>Soviet Official Regulations New Food Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 15th Broadcast: Moscow, according to the new food prices posted here today, roughly as follows: black bread at three rubles per kilogram, second-class white bread at 4.4 rubles, first-class white bread at seven rubles, black flour at 4.8 rubles, second-class white flour large, two rubles, first-class white flour at eight rubles, macaroni at ten rubles, lump sugar at fifteen rubles, first-class meat at thirty rubles, white pagoda sixty-four rubles, sunflower oil thirty rubles, fresh fish twelve rubles, salt 1.6 rubles, oats 2.5 rubles, apples sixteen to twenty-five rubles, coffee seventy-five rubles, ice cream twenty rubles, milk three to four rubles.</p>
<h3>Observations by British and American Figures Expected that the Soviet Union Will Establish a Ruble Bloc to Counter the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] Officials here believe that the Soviet Union's currency reform and the abolition of rationing can help the Soviet Union counter the Marshall Plan. It is expected that the Soviet Union may try to establish the international value of the ruble. Although the ruble has a nominal international value, there are actually no international ruble transactions. Until now, the Soviet Union's trade with other countries has been conducted by exchanging goods at the discounted currency of the other country. If the Soviet Union can establish the international purchasing value of the ruble, then other countries can trade with the Soviet Union at the discounted price of the ruble, allowing the Soviet Union to expand trade with Scandinavia and Eastern European countries. Officials here also expect that the Soviet Union will establish a ruble bloc to compete with the sterling area and the dollar bloc, and to compete with the Marshall Plan. Soviet economists are expected to propose a plan to make the ruble a gold standard currency with gold as a reserve to stabilize its value and counter the Marshall Plan. The Soviet gold reserves are estimated to be worth between 875 million and 4.25 billion pounds.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] International observers here believe that the Soviet Union's decision to re-establish the value of the ruble is a sign that the Soviet Union will seek power in Europe. Its purpose is to strengthen the Soviet domestic economy and fight the future Marshall Plan. There are also rumors here that the Soviet Union may put the ruble on the world market to compete with the dollar. According to the Soviet government's currency reform plan, the ratio of the ruble to the dollar remains at 5.3 to 1. Some British experts on Soviet affairs said: The Soviet currency reform will have the most significant impact on the people of the Baltic Soviet Republics and other new Soviet territories, which may accelerate the collapse of their independent peasant class. Experts continued to point out that the so-called collective farms in the Baltic countries have not yet been established in practice, and collective farms in the former Western Ukraine and the former Czech Carpatho-Ukraine are still not strong. The currency reform may promote their growth. Because in the reform, the middle peasant class, which suffered heavy losses, will thereafter take a collective form to protect the security of its property.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Federal Reserve officials said: The currency reform order broadcast by Radio Moscow actually indicates that the severity of inflation in the Soviet Union is even worse than outside observers had expected. State Department Deputy Director of the East European Division, Steven Stance, pointed out that one thing is very clear, that is, "the Soviet government has reduced its debt by one-third at once." He also said that savers have lost as much as one-tenth of their property under the new order, which is most tragic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] New York morning newspapers commented on the Soviet government's announcement of currency reform and the abolition of rationing, believing that the economic difficulties faced by the Soviet Union are the same as those of some capitalist countries. The New York Times said: The Soviet Union's move is to use totalitarian remedies for similar capitalist diseases. From the Soviet government's order, it can be seen that after thirty years of communist rule in Russia, the human nature of seeking profit has also revived in the Soviet Union. The New York Herald Tribune commented: The Soviet economy is as sick as the capitalist economy. However, the Soviet system may not be able to overcome such states.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Reopens Yesterday Marshall Responds in Writing to Soviet Accusations Denies Obtaining Commercial Profits from Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] It is believed here that Molotov had a long talk with the Kremlin last weekend to determine Soviet policy, so the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are eagerly watching today whether Molotov will cause the Foreign Ministers' Conference to break down. The delegations of Western countries are questioning whether the meeting this afternoon will determine whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference can continue.</p>
<p>This morning, Marshall discussed with his delegation countermeasures for any possible actions by Molotov. Bevin also discussed the crisis of the Foreign Ministers' Conference with Prime Minister Attlee. Marshall's final decision depends on whether Molotov has changed his position after two days of cold reception.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The U.S. delegation participating in the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference issued a statement denying that any U.S. gold industry had obtained German commercial property during the occupation period. This statement was submitted to the secretariat of the Foreign Ministers' Conference on Saturday to answer questions from the Soviet Union. The statement said: The United States has previously suggested prohibiting foreign interests from acquiring all German property and suggested that each occupying country report to the Allied Management Committee on its policies on this point, as well as factual reports on changes in property ownership in each occupied area. Although this suggestion was not accepted, the United States has always adhered to this principle. The statement of the U.S. delegation further stated that the materials exported from the Anglo-American zone were all sold at world market prices, and none of the proceeds from the sale were obtained by the occupying powers, and were used to purchase the main items needed for the German economy to import into Germany. From January 1 to November 1 of this year, the total exports of the Anglo-American occupied area reached 165 million US dollars.</p>
<h3>With a Center-Left Tone Italian Cabinet Reorganization Ready</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 14th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi has completed the center-left reorganization of his government today.

Gasperi's new cabinet still excludes the participation of the Communist Party and the left wing of the Socialist Party, and recruits five moderate leftists into the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Former British Conservative Politician Sir Baldwin Dies He Once Forced Edward VIII to Abdicate</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] The Marquess of Baldwin, a former British Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister three times, passed away in his sleep on the night of the 14th. After automatically relinquishing the position of Prime Minister in 1937, Baldwin settled in his old residence in Stanhope to spend his old age. He suffered from rheumatoid disease and was hemiplegic, and suffered from severe hearing loss.</p>
<p>Baldwin's Brief History</p>
<p>Sir Baldwin was born in 1867 and is exactly eighty years old this year. Baldwin has been a member of the House of Commons since he was elected in 1908, until he resigned as Prime Minister in 1937, having spent thirty years in his political career. He is a senior member of the Conservative Party and is considered a typical figure of British Conservatism. Between the two world wars, he served as Prime Minister three times, and had a significant impact on British political and financial affairs in recent decades. Baldwin began as a member of the House of Commons at the age of forty-one, and has represented his district for 29 years. He joined the cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1921. In 1923, when the Law Cabinet collapsed, Baldwin came out to form a cabinet, which was his first time serving as Prime Minister. Shortly thereafter, he stepped down due to the issue of guaranteeing tariffs. In 1924, he won the general election, and Baldwin again served as Prime Minister, until 1929. During this period, the construction of the Singapore Naval Base, the resolute severance of diplomatic relations with Russia, and the implementation of political blockade policies were all resolutely promoted by Baldwin. The great coal miners' strike in 1926 further realized his proclaimed "industrial peace and goodwill." In 1931, in order to cope with the financial crisis, McDonald led the organization of a coalition cabinet, and he provided a lot of help. In 1935, Baldwin served as Prime Minister for the third time.</p>
<p>In December 1936, he forced Edward VIII (i.e., the Duke of Windsor) to abdicate, and then retired himself, handing over the position to Chamberlain. At that time, Baldwin and the Archbishop of Canterbury forced Edward to choose between the throne and the beauty. Edward would rather abandon the throne and marry Mrs. Simpson, who had been divorced twice, becoming a timeless story of not loving the country but loving the beauty.</p>
<h3>New Iranian Prime Minister Heykmat Elected</h3>

<h3>Jin Du Bloodshed Case Sentenced in Nanjing Seven Military Police Given Sentences Luo Guoxin Executed Immediately Eight Police Officers Transferred to Local Court for Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 15th] The bloodshed case of the military police conflict at the Jin Du Theater in Shanghai, after more than four months of investigation and trial by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense, announced the verdict approved by the highest authorities on the 15th, and executed it immediately. The main criminal, Luo Guoxin (22 years old, from Liuzhou, first class private of the 8th Company, 23rd Regiment of the Military Police), was sentenced to death.

<h3>Various Tax Rates to Be Increased Next Year Property Tax and Business Tax to Be Doubled Municipal Government Revenue to Increase by Approximately 40 Billion</h3>
<p>All tax rates in the city will be comprehensively adjusted starting next year. The Ministry of Finance has already sent official documents to the Municipal Government to increase the following six items: property tax, business tax, slaughter tax, business license tax, vehicle license tax, and hospital prescription business tax. According to Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, who told the Dagong News reporter yesterday: This adjustment of tax rates is nationwide. The adjusted tax rates are as follows: The property tax will be doubled. The original tax of 5% is now 10%, and the original tax of 2.5% is now 5%. The business tax will be doubled. The original tax of 1.5% is now 3%, and the original tax of 3% is now 6%. The vehicle license tax (automobile license, etc.) is now increased to a minimum of 500,000 yuan and a maximum of more than 1 million yuan. The business license tax is increased tenfold. The original tax of 3/1000 is now 30/1000. The slaughter tax maintains the original tax rate of 5%, but increases the slaughter tax on cattle and horses.

It is estimated that the Municipal Government's tax revenue will increase by more than 40 billion yuan next year after the tax rate is increased. However, according to Tian, even after the tax rate is increased, it will still be difficult to balance the Municipal Government's revenue and expenditure.</p>

<h3>Heated Debate at Postal Workers' Congress, Membership Qualification Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The National Postal Workers' Representative Congress continued its ninth and tenth meetings yesterday to discuss the articles of association of the National Federation and the articles of association of various district unions. In the morning, 146 representatives attended, and in the afternoon, 102 representatives attended. Shui Xiangyun, Wang Yisheng, Ren Yue, and Wang Zhenbai took turns presiding. The issue of membership qualifications for postal workers' unions in various districts sparked a heated debate that lasted for over an hour before a resolution was reached. The principle was decided that all formal employees serving in the postal districts within the scope of the district unions, with the exception of the Director of the Postal Administration, Assistant Directors, Section Chiefs, and other bureau chiefs, as well as Deputy Postmasters and above, and the managers and assistant managers of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, are considered members. This provision is intended to prevent a small number of individuals from using their union positions to control the union or using the union as a tool to pressure the bureau. The publicity program for the postal workers' movement was also decided. After the meeting, all representatives attended a joint reception hosted by the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Senate at the Kangle Restaurant.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Special Committee to Handle Year-End Bonus Disputes, Two Extreme Factions Are Willing to Mediate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] To handle the year-end bonus issue for industries and businesses this year, the Social Affairs Bureau previously established a Research Committee on Year-End Bonus Issues. After convening industrial associations, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union to solicit opinions, a method was formulated and submitted to the Municipal Council for approval and implementation. The task of the Research Committee has now come to an end. Currently, the Bureau believes that it is inevitable that labor and management in various industries will have disagreements regarding year-end bonuses, leading to disputes. Therefore, it has decided to establish a special committee, named the Committee for Handling Year-End Bonus Issues, to be responsible for handling these disputes. The Bureau has appointed Lu Jingshi, the newly appointed Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor, as the chairman of the committee. Zhao Banfu is appointed as the vice-chairman, and Shen Ding, Fan Zhenbang, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Kaidi, Ling Yingzhen, Zhang Yongqin, and Gu Zusheng are appointed as committee members.</p>
<p>[Further News] Since the Municipal Council approved the method for distributing year-end bonuses to various factories and businesses in this city this year, stipulating one month's salary as the principle, calculated based on the index of that month, the industrial association first expressed that due to the economic downturn this year, they are unable to afford it. The General Labor Union also expressed disagreement with the points stipulating phased payments and allowing for amounts less than one month's salary, and both intend to appeal to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau separately. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that these are two extreme positions, and the Social Affairs Bureau will mediate to bring them together, and all issues must be resolved.</p>
<h3>One Month Bonus Stipulated for Six Major Public Utilities</h3>
<p>Cotton Textile Industry Annual Bonus to be Discussed Further Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses for employees of the six major public utilities in this city, namely electricity, telephone, gas, tap water, the British tram company, and the French water and electricity company, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau stated yesterday that a resolution has been reached. It is stipulated that bonuses will be issued according to last year's method, equivalent to one month's salary, and will be paid uniformly on January 15th of next year, calculated based on the cost of living index of that month. The payments on January 15th will be based on the December index of this year, with adjustments to be made after the January index is released.</p>
<p>Additionally, regarding the year-end bonus issue for the cotton textile industry in this city, labor and management attempted to negotiate on their own without success, and voluntarily convened at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon for further discussion. Zhao Banfu participated in the mediation. The management proposed three levels for the annual bonus: ten days, twelve and a half days, and fifteen days, which the labor side did not accept. Preliminary mediation did not yield any results, and it was decided to continue discussions tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Additional Wards to be Built at the Eighth Hospital</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Since Li Zhonglin, the director of the Caohejing Municipal Eighth Hospital, was ordered to make preparations, eight months have passed. After painstaking planning, most of the hospital buildings have been completed. However, due to insufficient funding, local gentry were especially asked to donate, and with the support of Mr. Xi Guansheng's transfer of funeral expenses, it was decided to add more wards and expand the hospital significantly.</p>
<h3>Theft of Mail from the Longshun Steamer, Two Passengers Suspected and Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] On the 8th of this month, while the Longshun steamer was sailing from Tianjin to Shanghai, it was discovered that several postal bags out of the ten large parcels entrusted by the post office had been slashed open, and the contents were stolen. Subsequently, a passenger, beef vendor Wang Yongchang, was found hiding in the cargo hold. Due to strong suspicion, he was detained. On the 10th, the incident was telegraphed to the Shanghai Post Office Management Office, which reported it to the Port Police Station. On the morning of the 11th, when the ship arrived in port, officers were dispatched to investigate. It was found that there was also a cotton quilt, a pair of woolen shoes, a Russian-style hat, and a bundle next to the postal bags. Under the cotton quilt, twelve bolts of Changdang brand colored cloth, a grass-green military blanket, and three wooden boxes of various sizes that had fallen out of the postal bags were discovered. Members of the post office were sent to identify and claim the above-mentioned cloth and other items. At this time, Ye Jingduo, who had previously posed as a public official while wearing a uniform, stepped forward and claimed that the cotton quilt belonged to his friend, who had gone ashore to buy cigarettes, and that he intended to collect it on his friend's behalf. The police station suspected that Ye was also involved, and took both suspects, Wang and Ye, into custody. They were later transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, the prosecutor held a hearing. Wang Yongchang stated that he had purchased a third-class ticket and that the cabin was extremely crowded. Due to the strong sea breeze outside, he had no choice but to find a gap in the cargo hold to rest, and denied any theft. Ye Jingduo stated that he had previously served as a soldier in the salt tax police corps in Wenzhou Haimen and other places and was currently working as a freelance laborer. He had purchased a fake seal of the Tianfu Management Office of Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, for 1,000 yuan and wore it to buy half-price tickets. He also denied theft. The prosecutor ordered both men to be temporarily detained and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>US Information Service Director Talks About Study Abroad Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The US Information Service held a tea party yesterday to welcome the new Director of the Shanghai Branch, Paul Furey. According to Mr. Furey, the US will use US$20 million for the exchange of Chinese and American professors and students. He estimated that the current cost for a Chinese student to study in the US, including round-trip travel expenses and tuition and board, is at least US$2,500 per year. At the same time, the most difficult problem currently is that all universities in the US are overcrowded. The exchange methods and detailed procedures for the aforementioned students will be discussed today at a meeting in Beijing convened by US Ambassador Stuart Leighton, Chairman of the US Education Foundation in China, with relevant ministers and US representatives.</p>

<h3>Putuoshan Kidnapping Case Concluded, Awaiting Verdict, Victims Testify in Court, All Four Defendants Granted Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The case of Chen Jinliang, the owner of the Huasheng Silk and Satin Printing and Dyeing Factory in this city, being kidnapped by bandits while visiting the Sansheng Hall on Putuoshan Island to worship Buddha, has been under court investigation. The abbot of the Sansheng Hall, Xingkong, the receptionist, Xingxian, and the incense keepers, Zhou Xiaoxiang and Jiang Shengquan, are suspected of colluding with the bandits. The case was concluded yesterday and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 22nd of this month. During the court session yesterday, the victim, Chen Jinliang, personally testified that on the night of July 12th, while he was playing mahjong with Xingkong and others in the Sansheng Hall, bandits broke into the hall, kidnapped him, and hid him in Zhujiajian. Xingkong and others accompanied Tang Shanxing, a representative of the bandits, to Shanghai to negotiate the ransom. The bandits demanded 40 gold bars, but in the end, they were released after receiving three gold bars and 100 million yuan in cash. As for whether Xingkong and others were suspected of colluding with the bandits, he did not know. All four defendants, Xingkong and others, firmly denied colluding with the bandits. Their dealings with the bandits were solely to rescue the benefactor, Chen Jinliang, and there was no malice or premeditation. The court concluded the debate, scheduled a date for the verdict, and ordered all four defendants in custody to be released on bail. Xingkong and others thanked the court and left.</p>

<h3>Charged with Carrying Gold, Passenger Detained on the Bus</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The patrol team of the Jing'an Temple Police Station saw two men riding a rickshaw at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Taixing Road at around 8 PM on the 13th, their behavior was suspicious. They were stopped and searched, and seven gold bars, each weighing five taels, were found on Wang Feirong. Suspecting that the source was unknown, he was taken to the station for questioning. Wang claimed that he had been working at the Binfeng Tobacco Shop on Nanjing East Road. Last year, he was laid off and received 10 million yuan in severance pay, which he used to purchase the gold bars. Recently, due to unemployment, he planned to invest in stocks, so he took the gold bars to Jiang Chonghui, a fellow villager at the Cunyi Yong Tobacco Shop at No. 20 Jiangxi Road, to mortgage them for cash. The police station believed that he was not without suspicion and decided to report to his superiors for a decision.</p>

<h3>The Crux of the Fisheries Dispute, Unideal Distribution, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Has No Authority to Deal With It, Minister Zuo Suggests Two Points</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] This reporter inquired about the handling of the fisheries dispute in this city with Minister Zuo Shunsheng. According to him, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has no authority to deal with this matter. He believes that the crux of this dispute lies not in overproduction, but in unideal distribution. If the Fisheries Management Office can supply fish to cities other than Shanghai on a wider scale, increasing production further would not seem to be a problem. During his visit to Shanghai, he suggested two points to the newly appointed Director of the Fisheries Management Office, Zhao Junmai: CNRRA should expand the fish market outside of Shanghai as much as possible. CNRRA should use new equipment to focus on fish processing, such as making salted fish or canned fish, for distribution to the interior. He believes that this approach is beneficial and harmless to the Fisheries Management Office, and private fishing companies can avoid going bankrupt due to excessive losses. He believes that this matter will be appropriately discussed at today's Jiangzhe Fisheries Improvement Conference. However, he has not received any complaints or requests from the private fisheries sector. Due to urgent matters within the Ministry, he returned to Nanjing by overnight train last night.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Plenary Session of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Improvement Conference, Minister Zuo Hopes Everyone Can Eat Fish</h3>

Furthermore, he said that from a personal perspective, he hopes everyone can eat fish. In the afternoon, the meeting continued at the Bankers Association, where the rules of procedure were adopted, and then divided into four groups: administration, construction, economy, and technology, to review proposals.</p>
<h3>Shenyang Textile Factory Staff Impersonating CNRRA to Commit Fraud, Air Freight of Dyes Worth Over 100 Billion, Extensive Involvement, Complex Inside Story, Liu Tianhong and Other Three Detained and Sent to the District Court for Questioning</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Liu Tianhong, director of the Shanghai office of the state-owned Shenyang Textile Factory, along with employees Chen Shanmin, Zhang Jingqiu, and Chen Jinping, impersonated the Northeast Branch of the CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and entrusted the Chennault Air Transport Command to transport 319 barrels of dyes, each weighing 603 catties. The barrels were all painted with the words "Northeast Branch of the CNRRA". The Air Transport Command dispatched eight aircraft to transport the dyes. The planes took off from Panyang and first landed at Beijing Airport, where 43 barrels of dyes were unloaded. The remaining 276 barrels flew directly to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the CNRRA had received a tip-off in advance and sent people to wait at Jiangwan Airport. When the plane landed, they immediately detained it in conjunction with the police bureau. Liu and the other three were arrested one after another, while Chen Jinping fled upon hearing the news. The police bureau, on the grounds that Liu and the others were all civil servants, transferred the suspects and stolen goods to the District Court for trial yesterday on charges of special criminal corruption. It is reported that the value of the dyes is over 100 billion yuan, involving the Panyang Textile Factory, the Air Transport Command, the Northeast Branch of the CNRRA and other agencies, and the inside story is extremely complex. The case is being heard by Judge Meng Tingke, and a hearing is scheduled to be held within this week.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's 75th Anniversary, Speaker Pan Expresses His Thoughts</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Today marks the 75th anniversary of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. When a reporter asked Speaker Pan Gongzhan for his thoughts, Pan said: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) were established almost at the same time, but before the war, the scale of the two was vastly different. The Japanese ships' routes covered the globe, while the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's routes did not go beyond the rivers and seas within the country. We are deeply ashamed. Few Qing Dynasty officials were willing to think about protecting the shipping industry and recovering profits like Li Hongzhang, and few people in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company over the years had the courage and boldness of Sheng Xuanhuai to acquire all the assets of the American-owned Russell &amp; Company. This is an inherent and fatal wound. Fortunately, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was liberated due to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and it is hoped that it can be revived. The company's demobilization preparations during the Anti-Japanese War and the demobilization work achieved after the victory are even more commendable. The six ships that fortunately escaped the robbery in the Sichuan River were able to overcome difficulties and be completely repaired. They were used for the transportation of military personnel and public servants, and the macro benefits were achieved, which could not be achieved by other transportation agencies. This is one. On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's assets were almost completely mortgaged. The eight years of bloody battle resulted in even greater debts, especially the debts of foreign banks. After the victory, at a time when financial resources were exhausted, it resolutely made repaying the price its top priority. After more than a year of negotiations, it was able to pay off all debts, and all the deeds that had been pledged were also fully recovered. From then on, the company's foundation became stronger, and it was able to focus on developing its shipping business. The quick resolution is unmatched by ordinary banks for those who have outstanding debts and unresolved lawsuits. This is two. After the revival, it happened that the country had many misfortunes, the Communist bandits were operating, and roads were destroyed everywhere. Waterborne military and public transportation became more frequent, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's battle was particularly difficult. Today, Qingdao is still preserved, Yantai has been recovered, and the entire Northeast has not yet fallen completely into the hands of the bandits, which cannot be said to be due to the company's rapid military transportation. If shipping rights had not been recovered by now and foreign ships could not be requisitioned, I am afraid that the rampant Communist bandits would be even more unimaginable. This is three. Although the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is state-owned, it can coexist harmoniously with private shipping companies, cooperate sincerely, and have equal rights and obligations. Compared with other state-owned enterprises, they do not compete with the people for profit, but instead fight each other, resulting in both sides being hurt in the past, which cannot be compared. This is four. Just these four points can be considered the longevity of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. We should hope that after celebrating its 75th anniversary, the company will strive to serve the public and develop ocean shipping routes with the spirit of its old age, in order to fulfill its due mission.</p>
<h3>Celebrations Held by All Branches Nationwide</h3>

<h3>Reports of Complete Repatriation of Japanese Nationals Are Definitely Inaccurate, In Fact, It Is Impossible</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Regarding the widespread rumors that all 1,300 or so Japanese nationals in this city will be completely repatriated to Japan by the end of the year, the person in charge of the Japanese National Management Section of the Police Bureau stated yesterday that this is definitely inaccurate. It is said that the Executive Yuan recently issued an order requiring all agencies to retain Japanese technical personnel, not to increase their numbers and to reduce them as much as possible, and the rumors of complete repatriation may have originated from this. Moreover, in terms of shipping, it would be impossible to repatriate all of them within the year.</p>

<h3>A Disaster Ridden, Twist-Filled Saga: The Whole Story of the Pukou-Jinan Section Opening to Traffic - Special Correspondent of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Aviation News from Jinan, This Newspaper, 11th] On the Tianjin-Pukou Railway main line, Cangxian to the north bank of the Yellow River, Tai'an to Hanzhuang, and the areas north and south of Bengbu have all been thoroughly destroyed by the communist bandits, cutting the line into three sections. When the government issued a ceasefire order on January 13, 1946, only three sections of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway were able to operate: Tianjin to Cangxian, Jinan to Tai'an, and Hanzhuang to Pukou. What is most heartbreaking is that the equipment of the three major coal mines along the line in Zibo, Southern Xintai, and Zaozhuang were all destroyed by the communist bandits. Due to the overall coal shortage, thousands of train wheels stopped turning, and the entire railway's transportation entered a state of paralysis.</p>
<p>After the ceasefire order was issued, the communist bandits not only did not stop their rebellious acts of harming the people's livelihood and damaging the nation's vitality but also intensified their efforts to occupy stations, detain vehicles, seize ticket revenue, and set up their own railway bureaus, thereby disrupting the entire railway management system. When the Executive Headquarters was in Tai'an, there was once an agreement to rush repairs southward, but when the repairs reached Dakou, they were again obstructed by the bandit army, and the bandit army even captured nine stations between Tai'an and Chaomidian.</p>
<p>The evolution of the situation to this point has in fact demonstrated the ambition and intentions of the communist bandits. They absolutely do not want this major north-south artery to be smoothly restored and contribute to the stability of the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Following the development of the military situation, the Railway Bureau decided to disregard all dangers and difficulties and began construction northward from Hanzhuang on October 9, 1946. By October 24, they had reached Lincheng. Based on the abundance of materials at that time and the enthusiasm of the employees, they could have continued to rush repairs forward. However, the flames of war north of Lincheng had not yet subsided, so they had to temporarily stop.</p>
<p>This spring, the war situation in Shandong took a sharp turn for the worse, and Xingzhou, an important town in southern Shandong, was also relieved. Thus, starting from March 11, repairs began from Lincheng towards Yanzhou. After 56 days of work, the great task of opening the Xuzhou-Zhaqian section to traffic was finally completed on May 18.</p>
<p>The section from Yanzhou to Jinan is 143 kilometers long. Because this section is near the mountainous area of Mount Tai, there are not only many curves and steep slopes, but also the bridges along the line are very high and long. For example, the Da Wen River Bridge is more than half a kilometer long, and the remaining bridges, such as the Shidian Bridge and the Jin River Bridge, are all between 14 meters and 18 meters in height. This section of the project is the most difficult section of the entire Tianjin-Pukou Railway project.</p>
<p>Driven by hot blood and a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>The 42,000 employees of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau did not flinch due to the harsh environment and the enormity of the project. Before the Xuzhou-Yanzhou section was opened to traffic, they began the earthwork for the Jinan-Yanzhou section. Track laying and bridge construction began on May 31. The initial plan was to work simultaneously from Yanzhou in the south and Jinan in the north, in order to complete the work as soon as possible. However, at that time, the Jiaoji Railway had been interrupted for the second time, and Jinan had become an isolated island. The transportation of materials was extremely difficult. Therefore, the employees who were evacuated from the Jiaoji Railway were used to dismantle the minor branch lines near Jinan and lay and nail the tracks. By the end of July, they had reached the south side of Gangshan Station, and the materials were exhausted. This group of people was then transferred south to Yanzhou to participate in the work of rushing repairs northward from Yanzhou.</p>
<p>The progress of this part of the project from Yanzhou northward was quite smooth. By July 10, the tracks had been laid to the south bank of the Houhe River. However, because the area south of Dakou South Station was filled with war clouds at that time, work was forced to stop for two months. Work resumed on September 10. Fourteen days later, the most difficult project—the temporary bridge of the Da Wen River Bridge—was almost completed. Who knew that a heavy rain on the night of the 23rd caused a mountain flood, which washed away the temporary bridge that was about to be completed. It was not until October 6 that it was completed and opened to traffic. The track laying work continued for a month and had already reached the foot of Mount Tai. Unexpectedly, the traffic between Xuzhou and Bengbu was interrupted twice, and the supply of materials could not keep up, causing a slight delay. After the traffic on the southern section was restored, the work</p>
<p>accelerated forward, and finally, at 11:00 p.m. on November 29, the rails were connected at kilometer 384 to 400, north of Zhangxia Station. More than two years have passed since the victory, and this disaster-ridden railway has finally completed its most difficult part after many twists and turns.</p>
<p>I boarded the special ceremony train and looked at the tracks extending towards Pukou and the broken walls and ruins on both sides of the railway, as well as several severely damaged bridges. I really couldn't describe what kind of mood I was in. The reporter saw Captain An Wenlan on the special train. He told me about the situation on the night of the rail connection. The Railway Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications to complete the rail connection and open the line to traffic before November 30. Captain An was determined to complete it on the 29th. That night, when their work was still 1.7 kilometers away, there was suddenly intelligence that a group of bandits was coming to disturb them. After careful consideration, Captain An said to all the employees, "There is no sound of dogs barking in the surrounding villages, which is enough to show that this intelligence is not accurate." So he continued to work and finally completed it that day. In fact, at that time, An himself could not judge what the bandit situation was like. However, in order to achieve the final goal of</p>
<p>connecting the rails and opening the line to traffic, he had no choice but to use this to stabilize the morale of the employees and complete this final part of the work.</p>
<p>When the Da Wen River Bridge was being built, due to a sudden downpour, the water level suddenly rose, and the waves surged, resulting in more than 70 people falling into the water. Those who continued to build, several employees braved the deep autumn cold water, stripped naked and entered the water, resulting in illness, and are still under treatment.</p>
<h3>Eight Bandits Came to Suzhou, Buying Weapons and Were Arrested</h3>
<p>[Suzhou This Newspaper, 15th] The Suzhou Garrison Command received a report that communist bandits from northern Jiangsu were disguising themselves as self-defense forces from Rugao County to sneak into the Suzhou-Shanghai area to purchase weapons. After days of careful investigation, yesterday, they successively arrested eight key criminals, including Zhang Fangce, who falsely claimed to be the captain of the 34th Company of the 12th Brigade of Rugao County.

<h3>Cotton Merchant Representatives Visit Chairman Yuan of the Textile Adjustment Committee; Report on Cotton Transportation and Sales Situation; Unified Purchase Measures Can Be Implemented Once Approved by the Central Government</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Representatives from the Shanghai Cotton Commercial Association, including Liu Pingsun and Zou Zhecheng, visited Chairman Yuan of the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday at 3:30 PM. Mr. Liu and others reported in detail on the recent cotton transportation and sales situation: The cotton purchasing season has only one and a half months left this year. If the announcement of the unified purchase measures is delayed, it will affect the cotton picking season. Transportation on the Longhai, Pinghan, and other railways, as well as in various cotton-producing areas, is frequently blocked, so timely emergency transportation should be carried out. Currently, the cost of transporting cotton from Hankou to Shanghai already accounts for half of the cost. Although Shanghai cotton merchants currently have goods arriving, various yarn factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude because the unified purchase is imminent and are not purchasing. On the one hand, the unified purchase measures have not yet been promulgated, and the unified purchase organization has not been established, so cotton merchants are feeling financially strained. It is hoped that under the future unified purchase situation, the position of the cotton merchants will still be taken into account.</p>
<p>Chairman Yuan indicated that the unified purchase measures can be implemented as soon as they are approved by the central government. In the future, the unified purchase measures will still be willing to use the original cotton purchasing agencies, including cotton merchants. Applications will be made by various agencies to purchase on behalf of the government in various locations, according to the regulations. Chairman Yuan finally expressed the hope that cotton merchants would continue to purchase cotton, and the Control Committee would definitely not allow cotton merchants to suffer losses.</p>
<p>Another report: The implementation measures for cotton yarn and cloth management, after being drafted by Chairman Yuan Liang and others of the Textile Adjustment Committee, are now being personally submitted to Nanjing by Mr. Yuan for approval today. Once approved, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee can be prepared to be established and actively carry out its work.</p>
<h3>Price of Textile Construction Allocation Unchanged; Cotton Yarn Initially Stable, Then Lower</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday in the yarn market, Textile Construction opened for sale as usual, and the allocation price was unchanged. The market situation was initially stable, then lower. Near closing, it rebounded slightly, but as a result, 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn fell 200,000 compared to Saturday's closing price, falling to 49 million. In addition, various counts of coarse and fine yarns mostly fell back.</p>
<p>Another report: The China Textile Construction Company and the Textile Adjustment Committee sold yarn separately yesterday as usual, resulting in a total sale of 1,720 pieces of various counts of yarn, equivalent to 2,295 pieces of spun yarn. There were a total of 649 applicants.</p>
<p>The price of various counts of yarn sold yesterday, the 20-count yarn sold by Textile Construction, was still calculated at 28.11 million. The Textile Adjustment Committee sold yarn in the cotton yarn market, with a reserve price of 31.6 million for 20-count Hong Kuixing.</p>
<p>Cloth Steady</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was mostly stable, but there were few customers. Internal traders were unable to make any progress. Near closing, there were occasional scattered transactions, and as a result, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, continued to rise compared to Saturday, from 5,000 to 14,000. Serge sales were relatively strong, also rising 5,000 to 10,000, while the market for other cloths was firm and steady.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was quiet, with few transactions. Yarn factories were short on cash, and traders were also short on funds. Sellers were holding on to their goods, so transactions stalled.</p>
<h3>Committee of Private Textile Factories in the Rear Area Hosts the Press; Plans to Request Three Points from the Authorities</h3>

<p>During the War of Resistance, the various private yarn factories in the rear area, including Yuhua, Yufeng, Dahua, Zhenhuan, and Shenxin No. 4 Factory, suffered significant losses, totaling sixteen units, while also making great contributions to supplying military and civilian needs. Now, two years after the victory, the situation of these factories is still extremely difficult, and the government has not yet provided any assistance. It has recently been heard that the state-owned Textile Construction Company will soon sell off private enterprises, so it is planned to request three points from the authorities, with the following steps:</p>
<p>Request priority purchase rights (this point has recently been approved by the National Economic Council). Please ask the government to implement priority purchase rights as soon as possible. It is hoped that representatives can be dispatched to attend the valuation and sale committee's subcommittee meetings, so as to contribute opinions.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The rice market was relatively stagnant yesterday, with a total arrival of 12,363.6 shi. Due to the influence of rain and high prices in the production areas, market prices were 340,000 higher than last Saturday. White Jing sold for 895,000 in the southern market and 930,000 in the northern market, and Extra High Jing sold for 940,000. Bao Dao sold for 930,000, Early Rice sold for 890,000, Yang Xian sold for 925,000, Du Xian sold for 890,000, White Yuan sold for 950,000, and Yin Yuan sold for 940,000.</p>
<p>Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau stated yesterday that there is still no consideration for implementing comprehensive food rationing from next year. Currently, preparations are only being made to expand rice rationing for poor households. In the second phase of rice rationing for poor households, the total amount requested by various districts was 130,000 dan, and as a result, 100,000 dan were approved. The amount will be increased in the next phase.</p>
<p>Flour Rises, Oil Market Stable</p>
<p>Flour digestion is very active, prices soaring, a jump of seven skins, a wind of speculation, rising again by 8,9000 yuan. Soybean cake trading is normal, initially firm then weak, rising unevenly by 3-5000 yuan. Yellow soybeans were flat, buyers and oil mills did not see a boom, but sellers were still firm, with small increases for customer beans of 10,000 yuan. Red beans made gains of 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Green beans had little supply and demand, with no fluctuations for the time being. Cowpeas had stagnant digestion, with few buyers, in a situation of stagnant price rises. Broad beans had some activity, stepping up 120,000 yuan, red sorghum from the north was cold and sluggish, adding slightly 5,6000 yuan. Corn from the north was smoothly consumed, hitting new high prices, flying up 3-40,000 yuan. Raw peanuts competed with each other between the Guangbang market and the street, continuing to rise 3-40,000 yuan, quickening digestion. Sesame from Tianjin was smoothly handled, with oil mills grabbing it, and purchases on this street were also not weak, wildly jumping 6-70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market was mixed, with raw oil arriving in succession, appearing balanced. Soybean oil was first firm then weak, rising slightly 1-20,000 yuan. Vegetable and sesame oil sales were active, prices rising 7-80,000 yuan, small-scale sesame oil was scarce and firm, sharply rising 100,000 yuan, and oil rationing is currently being handled urgently, to be released soon.</p>
<h3>British Merchants Order Keemun Black Tea</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Four Banks Joint Treasury has approved a two-month mortgage period for export boxed tea mortgages this year. Any tea that is not redeemed after the mortgage period will be handled according to the processing measures. The mortgaged boxed tea has been expiring continuously since the 20th of last month. The Shanghai Export Association wired the Four Banks Joint Treasury requesting a two-month extension due to export difficulties, but it was not approved. Now, tea companies are rushing to raise funds to redeem the large batch of mortgaged boxed tea that is due to expire on the 13th of this month, fearing that it will be processed, but the issue of exporting after redemption is causing much hesitation. It has been learned that the Anhui Tea Company recently sent samples to London, England, to actively promote sales, and yesterday received a reply from there, stating that they were ordering several hundred boxes of Keemun black tea, which could be packaged and exported in the near future. This is the beginning of Keemun black tea producers exporting to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's tea market: Domestic sales and export tea trading were almost completely stagnant. Due to the impact of the rain, both buyers and sellers were hesitant to move forward. In this situation, the overall trend was one of consistent calmness and immutability.</p>
<h3>Outside Speculative Funds Infiltrate; Chinese Stocks Generally Rise</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially weakened yesterday, then rebounded. After the infiltration of speculative funds from outside the industry, small-cap and miscellaneous stocks showed their strength, causing a general rise. Evergreen Silk and other major stocks, however, lagged behind, and the future continued to look uncertain.</p>
<p>Initially in the morning, there were no signs of changes in exchange rates, and the unfavorable effects of checking warehouses and controlling brokerage houses suddenly arose. Evergreen Silk opened at 433 yuan and 446 yuan. After opening, it rose to 436 yuan and 449 yuan, then retreated to a low of 428 yuan for immediate delivery and 437 yuan for deferred delivery. China Enamel for both prompt and deferred delivery were at their daily limit. Evergreen Silk rose to 438 yuan and 452 yuan, then declined slightly to 432 yuan and 444 yuan, the off-exchange finally squeezed shorts, higher than the on-exchange by as much as 10 yuan, sentiment was brisk, the number of small-cap stocks was extremely low, even easier to increase, all kinds of hot money absorbed endlessly, a dazzling scene. Zhabei Underwear, Tongyi, China Silk, and Firewood first forcibly reached the rising limit in the chaos, followed by Yonggong, Tongyi, French Business, New Hundred, China Textile, Jinglun, Lianan, and Huaxin raising high to the upper limit. Near noon, Evergreen Silk rose to a high of 466 yuan for prompt delivery and 480 yuan for deferred delivery, and then closed at 461 yuan and 475.3 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Evergreen Silk rose less than half a percent, China Xing rose slightly, China Cement and New Asia were flat, Xinhe, American Asia, New Guang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Wuhe each rose strongly by 10%, Zhabei, French, Xinhua Underwear, Datong, Rongfeng, and China Textile rose after hitting the limit, squeezing up 10% to 15%, Xinhua, China Enamel, Lianan, Firewood Business, China Silk, and Tongyi reached the daily limit. For deferred delivery shares, China Enamel and Yonggong reached the daily limit, Xinhe, American Asia, Jingfu, New Guang, and Qinxing each rose strongly by 10%, and Evergreen Silk rose half a percent.</p>
<p>The after-market continues to be brisk, with as many as sixteen kinds of stocks hitting the upper limit during the morning session. Evergreen Silk advanced to new highs of 475 yuan and 485 yuan, and then fell back to lows of 466 yuan and 472 yuan. Although it later advanced to 470 yuan and 480 yuan, with many National Bank trades in and out, it fell to 461 yuan and 467 yuan, with settlement and then exits. The closing price was 464 yuan and 468 yuan, with only China Enamel, Xinhua, Jinglun, China Cement, and China Textile rising to the limit, and the rest falling back. As a result, compared to the morning closing price for prompt delivery shares, Qinxing and Yonggong were flat, New Asia rose half a percent, Huaxin, Zhabei, Xinhe, New Guang, Jingfu, Underwear, Lianan, Firewood China Silk, Tongyi, and Rongfeng slightly retreated, China Enamel, Xinhua, China Cement, Jinglun, and Business rose to the limit, the rest all rose slightly. For deferred delivery shares, in addition to China Enamel hitting the limit, the rest all rebounded slightly. Off-exchange old shares Xinxin and Shanghai Cement rose 10%, as did Wuzhou, Dasheng and Culture shares each rose half a percent.</p>
<h3>Paper Production Increase Plan Decided; Bright White Paper and Wood Pulp Will Increase Greatly</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The National Economic Council convened a paper production increase conference on the 12th and 13th of this month, attended by more than thirty representatives from government agencies, private factories, and agricultural land. After two days of research and discussion, the following important resolutions were produced:</p>
<p>Increase Production: This year's domestic production of white paper is 66,000 tons, and it is planned to increase it to 110,000 tons next year. This year's production of paperboard is 50,000 tons, and it is projected to increase to 70,000 tons next year, for a total increase of approximately 70,000 tons, hoping that half of it will be used for newspapers.</p>
<p>Increase Wood Pulp Production: In addition to preparing to import 50,000 tons next year, it is also planned to increase the production of domestic factories and establish new wood pulp mills. There will be a total of five new mills: Qingdao Mill, producing 20 tons per day; Shanghai Mill, producing 30 to 50 tons per day; Zhejiang Mill, producing 20 tons per day; another mechanical wood pulp mill will be established, producing 30 tons per day; Tianjin Mill will produce 10 to 25 tons per day; Hunan Mill will produce 50 tons per day. In addition, the Tainan Paper Mill has decided to implement an increase in production. It is expected that after four months, it will be able to produce 60 tons of bagasse pulp per day, but with the prerequisite of having coal, because the raw material is easily obtained with coal. The Yibin China Paper Mill will be able to produce 5 tons of fir pulp per day after six months, and 40 tons per day after a year and a half.</p>
<p>The meeting also decided that convenience in foreign exchange settlements should be given to machines used to manufacture wood pulp and newspaper. Among the various materials used in papermaking, uranium copper wire netting will be allowed to be imported. Blankets used for manufacturing high-quality paper will also be allowed to be imported, while blankets used for manufacturing lower-quality paper will be restricted. Canvas that China cannot manufacture itself will also be allowed to be imported.</p>
<p>In addition, it is planned to open one copper wire blanket factory and one copper wire netting factory. The foreign exchange needed will be provided by the government, while the working capital will be raised by private factories. Regarding the future supply of copper wire netting, blankets, and canvas, it was decided to organize a material supply committee, jointly composed of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, the National Resources Commission, and representatives from various regions, to conduct a joint review.</p>
<p>According to Chen Taoxin, head of the Chemical Engineering Section of the Guidance Office, who attended the meeting, if all parties can cooperate, China will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in paper within two to three years under this plan. In the future, imported paper will in principle be limited to three categories: newsprint, cigarette paper, and cellophane; among them, cigarette paper consumes an average of 100,000 rolls per month, but the Minfeng Paper Mill can produce 60,000 to 80,000 rolls next year, and it is hoped that imports can be gradually reduced within one to two years, and eventually completely self-sufficient.</p>
<p>There were two major gains from the meeting convened by the National Economic Council. One was that without the above plan, the Qingdao Mill might shut down next year, and paper production in the city would decrease, and the paper mills in southwestern Taiwan would only be able to maintain their current status; the other was that the implementation of the production increase plan would save a lot of foreign exchange, which could be used to purchase papermaking equipment.</p>
<p>Sugar Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended upwards due to a slight increase in digestion, white sugar continued to rise 4-67,000, red sugar rose 3-45,000 per package. The Guild traded, two-four coarse white large bags were 1.278 million yuan, two-zero medium sand white was 1.23 million yuan, Taiwan red was 1.23 million yuan, totaling a hundred or so packages. Xinghua white high goods were 1.225 million yuan without any, Louzhuang was 1.189 million yuan, Xing red was 1.12 million yuan to 100,000 yuan, totaling over eight hundred items. Diao Qing was 880,000, totaling over three hundred packages.</p>
<p>Commercial Briefs</p>
<p>The China Trust Bureau's auction of enemy property in November yielded a total of 150 billion yuan, 50 billion yuan more than the previous month.</p>
<p>Jin Guobao, head of the accounting department of the National Bank, went to the United States in August to attend the International Statistical Congress and has returned to China after completing his work, arriving in Shanghai on the 14th.</p>
<p>Yesterday, cigarette prices initially fell and then rebounded. Ten Sticks of Gouying Old Knife No. 2 cigarettes were up 350,000 to 250,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes were also firmer.</p>
<p>Daily necessities soap, trading was still good, Gu Ben, Arrow, Xiangmao, soft Guanghua, Niupai, and Tingli, etc., strongly increased by 5-670,000 yuan, the match market was also not prosperous.</p>
<p>In the timber market, cedar wood was firm due to rising prices in the production areas, and the market price has exceeded 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Qingdao Port Authority: In November, the total volume of imports and exports was 60,181 tons, of which coal accounted for an estimated 30%, followed by flour, wood, and fish. Exports totaled 18,544 tons, of which salt and cotton yarn each accounted for an estimated 82%, followed by alcohol.</p>

<h3>Yan Fu and Hegel</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yu</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Jidao holds an extremely high position in the Chinese intellectual world. Yan's contributions to the introduction of new Western ideas at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China were significant. I remember when I was a child, I studied at a senior primary school in my hometown, and a teacher named Li, with slightly newer ideas, taught us Yan's translation of Evolution and Ethics. I read it and liked it, and I could almost recite the whole article. Later, in middle school and university, Yan's famous translations, such as A System of Sociology, On Liberty, Mill's Logic, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, became the object of my search and study. This was not only because I liked the novelty of the ideas, but also because I liked the elegance and rigor of the writing. When students of the early Republic wrote, they would often use phrases such as "survival of the fittest" at the drop of a hat, which was undoubtedly influenced by Mr. Yan. Looking back today at China's New Culture Movement, Mr. Yan's contribution cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Judging from the various books translated by Mr. Yan, the Western thought introduced by Mr. Yan seems to be limited to the evolutionism and utilitarianism of 19th-century England. Such as Spencer, such as Huxley, were speakers of evolution. Such as Adam Smith, such as Mill, were speakers of utilitarianism. Mr. Yan should be held responsible for the introduction of evolutionism and utilitarianism into China. Mr. Yan has no special books introducing the orthodox schools of Western philosophy, such as Kant and Hegel. This is why those who speak of orthodox Western philosophy today feel quite regretful. Those who discuss Mr. Yan also mistakenly believe that Mr. Yan was unaware of the theories of Kant and Hegel because Mr. Yan did not translate the works of Kant and Hegel. In fact, although Mr. Yan did not translate the works of Kant and Hegel, he was not unaware of the theories of Kant and Hegel, nor was he completely unfamiliar with them. Mr. Yan once wrote an article entitled "On Hegel's Idealism," which was published in the second issue of The Chinese Students' Quarterly. This article is little known, and it is not included in the collection of Mr. Yan's writings. When we read Mr. Yan's article, we know that Mr. Yan has a deep understanding of Hegel's theories. The author's note at the end of the article is especially sufficient to show Mr. Yan's understanding of orthodox Western thought. Here is a special record of his author's note as follows:</p>
<p>"Yan Fu said that the European theory of mind and nature underwent a change with Descartes, and a second change with Kant. Since then, all those like Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer have promoted what Kant invented. However, there are also people who have made progress, which is sufficient to make up for what previous philosophers have not achieved. And Hegel and Schopenhauer have gained even more. Therefore, they have been able to establish their own theories, and German philosophy has competed with ancient Greece in terms of brilliance. The reason why Kant is regarded as the supreme master of modern philosophy is that he clarified that the two things of the universe are the good abilities of the human mind, and the human mind is like the five senses to the form. If space and time are indeed internal and not from the outside, then the theory of 'the world is created by the mind' by Gautama, and the Confucian doctrine of 'achieving balance and harmony, the heavens and the earth are in their proper places, and all things are nurtured,' are all clear and unambiguous, and are explanations that cannot be erased. Hegel was based on this theory, so the theory of idealism arose. In ancient times, the theory of transformation was based on the idea that what is internal is the divine, and what is external is the material, and the two do not conspire with each other and are completely separate. But Hegel believed that everything is in the mind, but the subject and object have different views. This combines the theories of Kant and Descartes. From this, the phenomena of ancient and modern history, ups and downs, changes and subtractions, are all the actions of objective psychology. However, there is order in it, so the evolution is to move towards a state of mind without opposition, which I have translated as 'Imperial Ultimate.' Therefore, his theory of transformation is often a borrowed arrow for modern evolutionists, and it also has points of intersection with the subtle words and exquisite meanings of our country's past sages. (Such as Zhang Hengqu's saying: 'Establishing a heart for the earth,' try to ask where the heart of heaven and earth is seen?) Hegel wrote many theories, and later scholars often find them difficult to read. In the summer of Bingwu, I returned to Shanghai from Anhui. Just as The Chinese Students' Quarterly was published, the president, Mr. Li Denghui, and others came to me to ask for writing, writing seven or eight letters before and after, almost unable to stop, so I reluctantly waved my sweat and revealed Hegel's essence as above. The discussion is limited to the two minds of living and objective, and there is still no time to discuss the mind without opposition."</p>
<p>Although this author's note is only a few hundred words, it cannot be said by those who have not entered the door of orthodox Western thought. That Mr. Yan had researched Hegel, can be clearly demonstrated here. In addition, there are one or two points in Mr. Yan's translation of Hegel's philosophical terms that are also worth noting. For example, Dialectic is usually translated as dialectics, which is not very satisfactory. Zhang Dongsheng once translated it as "opposed performance method", He Sa once translated it as "contradiction method", and Yan Fu translated it as "mutual generation". Moreover : "Hegel's dialectics, that the conflicting principles generate each other. For example, the stricter the rules, the more secret the means of trickery. What Lao Tzu said, is mostly this kind of name studies." This translation is one that has not been noticed by recent people. Also, Absolute is usually translated as absolute, He Lin once translated it as Taiji, and Yan Fu translated it as "Imperial Ultimate". Which is better, Taiji or Imperial Ultimate, is not easy to judge lightly. The author knew that many people know that Mr. Yan has a deep relationship with evolutionism and utilitarianism, but do not know that he also has research on Hegel's philosophy, so I will briefly explain it as above.</p>
<h3>Russell's Childhood - Xie Youwei</h3>
<p>·One of Russell's Autobiographies·</p>
<p>The British philosopher Bertrand Russell is one of the greatest thinkers of our time. His scholarship and writings have long been known to the Chinese people. He once came to China to lecture and had a considerable influence on China's intellectual circles. His scholarship is very broad; he is not only a philosopher but also a scientist. He discusses political issues, social issues, and educational issues. His discussions are never conventional and are always innovative. He is now nearly eighty years old, still alive and well, and still writing constantly. Just two years ago, he published a monumental work of over eight hundred pages: *A History of Western Philosophy*. His energy is astonishing. How did he achieve his current position? What was his academic journey like? What were the stages of his intellectual development? These are all things that are worth knowing. Recently, in the *Library of Living Philosophers*, edited by Northwestern University in the United States, there is "The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell," including Russell's autobiography, titled "My Mental Development," which details his personal academic journey. It provides a clear account of the reasons for his intellectual transformations in his early, middle, and later years. It seems that anyone who studies knowledge should read it. Unfortunately, the article is too long to introduce in its entirety. I intend to divide it into three sections and describe them succinctly. Now, let's start by describing his childhood thoughts and life.</p>
<p>Russell was born into an aristocratic family. His grandfather, Lord John Russell, had served as the British Foreign Secretary. His father, Lord Amberley Russell, had also served as a member of the British Parliament. Russell lost both parents early in life. He was only three years old when his father died, and only two years old when his mother died. He was raised by his grandfather. His thoughts seem to have been directly unaffected by his parents, but strangely, his thoughts had many similarities to his father's. He was a liberal, and his father was also a liberal. His father strongly believed in the doctrines of John Stuart Mill, advocating for women's suffrage and birth control. He had no enthusiasm for religion; his father also did not believe in Christianity at the age of twenty-one and did not attend church. Even his mother was very progressive in her thinking and advocated for gender equality. If a person's thoughts can be inherited, Russell's thoughts are an example of such inheritance.</p>
<p>Russell believed that he was greatly influenced by his grandmother in his childhood. His grandmother was a Puritan and lived a very austere life. She did not value clothing or food, and she was especially opposed to drinking alcohol and smoking. She wanted her descendants to be useful and virtuous people, but she did not want them to pursue worldly glory. She believed in the dignity of private judgment and individual conscience. On his twelfth birthday, Russell's grandmother gave him a Bible, which Russell still keeps to this day. In this Bible, his grandmother wrote down many of her favorite maxims from the Bible, one of which was, "You shall not follow a crowd to do evil;" and another was, "Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." Russell said that these maxims "deeply influenced my life, and even after I stopped believing in God, they seemed to retain some meaning."</p>
<p>When Russell was eleven years old, he began to read Euclid's *Elements*. At first, he was quite disappointed with Euclid because Euclid started with axioms, and axioms had to be accepted without proof. But after reading it, he was very happy with it. Therefore, during his entire childhood, most of his interest was concentrated on mathematics. He said that his interest in mathematics was due to complex reasons: partly because he discovered that he had a certain knack for it, partly because he liked the power of deductive reasoning, and partly because of the quiet certainty of mathematics; but the main reason (when he was still young) was because he believed that nature operated according to mathematical laws, and if we had enough skill, human actions, like the movements of celestial bodies, could be predicted. He said that at the age of fifteen, he came up with a theory very similar to that of Descartes. He firmly believed that the actions of organisms were completely governed by mechanical laws; therefore, the doctrine of free will must be false. However, he could not accept materialism because he believed that consciousness was an undeniable "datum." At this time, he still believed in God because he thought that the First Cause Argument for God's existence was irrefutable.</p>
<p>Russell did not attend school in his childhood. His early education was entirely provided by private tutors. He was taught by several German and Swiss nannies and governesses, and later by English tutors at home. He said that at the age of fourteen or fifteen, he had a strong interest in religion. He gradually began to study the arguments for free will, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of God. His life was very lonely. He felt that there was no one he could talk to. He could only write down what he had learned in his diary in Greek letters, and he dared not tell anyone. For a full three years, his mind was focused on religious issues. First, he abandoned the doctrine of free will, and then he abandoned the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, but it was not until he was eighteen years old that he stopped believing in God. The reason was that at that time, he happened to read Mill's autobiography, which said, "My father taught me that the question, 'Who made me?' cannot be answered, because this question immediately raises another question, 'Who made God?'" Thus, he decided that the First Cause Argument for God's existence was wrong.</p>
<p>During his home education, Russell read a wide range of books. No one guided his reading, so he felt that he had read many useless books. He had read many bad poems, especially those of Tennyson and Byron. It was not until he was seventeen that he found Shelley's poems to read. For many years, Shelley was his favorite ancient writer. He had also read many of Carlyle's essays, especially admiring his book *Past and Present*. He agreed most with Mill. Mill's books, such as *Principles of Political Economy*, *On Liberty*, and *The Subjection of Women*, had deeply influenced him. He had also carefully read Mill's *Logic* and written many marginal notes. But he could not agree with Mill's claim that mathematical propositions are empirical generalizations, although he still did not know what mathematical propositions could be.</p>
<p>It was not until he was eighteen that he entered Cambridge University. This ended his lonely life at home and opened up a new world for him in academia.</p>
<h3>The Heart and Emotion in Aesthetic Experience - Han Yuwen</h3>
<p>In aesthetic experience, the heart is contemplative or meditative, and emotion is expressed in a concrete structure or form. Now, let's briefly explain these two points separately.</p>
<p>I. The Heart in Aesthetic Experience is Contemplative or Meditative.</p>
<p>The term "contemplative" or "meditative" is often used in the aesthetic attitude. In other words, we often say that the aesthetic attitude is contemplative or meditative. For example, we say that a lover of nature, an admirer or critic of a work of art, holds a contemplative or meditative attitude towards the object they love, admire, or criticize. At the same time, we say that their attitude is aesthetic; although the aesthetic component of their attitude is not as genuine and complete as that expressed by a creative artist; because the truly aesthetic attitude, on the negative side, cannot be immersed in the object being admired, becoming lost and adrift, never to return, even to the point of losing the clear, bright, transcendent, and pure original mind; but general admirers of art, such as theater or dance audiences, concert audiences, are easily overwhelmed or led away by the objects they admire; the creative artist must maintain their clarity, freely pursuing the emotional narrative of their aesthetic experience and trying to express it faithfully. From this, we can know that the truly aesthetic attitude, on the positive side, is expressive and active; it is not merely a passive enjoyment. In short, in aesthetic experience, the still heart is clear, tranquil, and active; it has neither the satiety of material enjoyment nor the greed of material enjoyment. This contemplative attitude, like the theoretical and practical attitudes, has its objects, or is directed towards its objects. But the theoretical and practical attitudes both manipulate and change their objects; the characteristic of the practical attitude is to create objects with will; the characteristic of the theoretical attitude is to use concepts to explain objects; the characteristic of the aesthetic attitude is to contemplatively express objects, without changing them. Even in creative art, the creation is a perception, attached to full imagination, complete "seeing" and "hearing," which will be discussed later.</p>
<p>II. Emotion in Aesthetic Experience is Concretely Expressed in a Structure or Form.</p>
<p>This is a very important characteristic of aesthetic emotion. Because emotions that generally lack structure or a definite form of expression are unclear, private, and constantly changing with the changes in an individual's body and mind, easily disappearing. Its object is a natural object with thoughts, not an expression of emotion. There cannot be deeper, higher aesthetic experiences in this. If you have the power to depict the object or content in which you place your emotion, and give it an imaginative form, or express it as poetry, or express it as painting, or express it as music, etc., then your object becomes a definite, lawful, objective object; and your and others' emotions towards it must obey its laws, and cannot be arbitrarily changed, increased, or decreased; on the contrary, the emotion at this time must be permanent, orderly, harmonious, and simply put, valuable. If it is joy, your joyful heart clearly feels your joy, and also clearly understands what you are joyful about; if it is sorrow, your sorrowful heart also clearly feels your grief, and also clearly understands what you are sad about. In short, your object at this time is like a carved, translucent, intricately inlaid gemstone, with a concrete form to observe, a definite standard to take, and the whole is an expression of your emotion, so your emotion and your object become one, and also have a concrete form and law that lasts unchanged, clear and transparent, can be transmitted. Universally understood, and not a chaotic, blurry, self-focused, confused private emotion. This kind of concretely expressed emotion, when you feel it, is aesthetic emotion.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Academic World (2) - Zhang Qiyun</h3>
<p>The Science of Livelihood and Settlement</p>
<p>Isaiah Bowman, President of Johns Hopkins University in the United States, served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. On September 11, 1943, at the Association's annual meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, Bowman gave a speech entitled "Commanding Our Wealth," the original manuscript of which was published in *Science* (September 15 of the same year). This article specifically mentions China. Please briefly describe the main points for reference.</p>
<p>Bowman said that if, after the war, people still cannot enjoy a reasonable life, then it can be said that victory has not been achieved. He quoted Bismarck's words that a nation with abundant resources but ignorance, or even if it knows them but cannot make full use of them, the richness of resources is enough to invite national disasters. Therefore, he advocated that the way to build a nation is people first, land second. The difference between China and the United States is that China relies solely on agriculture, so-called building the country on agriculture, land is the source of life, and farmers often struggle on the poverty line. In the United States, agriculture is only one of the elements of building a nation. Industry is developed, technology is advanced, industry and agriculture, cities and villages, support each other and maintain balance, so people's lives are more satisfactory. Today, the key points for building a nation are to reclaim wasteland, afforest, control water and conserve soil, use machinery, develop resources, revitalize industry, and develop transportation, in order to increase employment opportunities, improve living standards, maintain social justice, and promote international cooperation. Just in terms of agricultural production, how to increase production, improve quality, expand markets, and stabilize prices, the details are complicated and the relationships are intricate. But such undertakings cannot be effective with empty principles, and must engage in detailed regional research. Where is suitable for forestry, where is suitable for animal husbandry? Even in the same place, due to different altitudes, climate, plants and people's livelihoods also vary. Regional investigation and experimental work are the foundation of the great cause of building a nation. The tree of peace can only flourish if its roots are deeply planted in scientific research. Bowman named this kind of knowledge the Science of Settlement, the purpose of which is to master and adjust land, population, and resources.</p>
<p>The national boundaries of various countries in the world cannot be arbitrarily changed, and each country pays attention to domestic unity and national unity. Those who cannot assimilate foreign immigrants are often not welcomed. The policy of building a nation is better to develop resources and utilize the way of improving life within one's own territory. China is also like Europe. If it can build peacefully, it is enough to support the national population. It is better to seek help from oneself than from others. In terms of overseas immigration, it is already extremely difficult to maintain the historical status of overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Bowman's intention is that if policies like the White Australia policy are recognized as having present reasons, then the economic recommendations to help China are a natural conclusion. The industrialization of China is very important to world peace. The world cannot be partly broken and desolate, and partly prosperous and happy. Boasting about national power and disregarding others is tantamount to deceiving oneself, which is extremely dangerous. Even with the prosperity of American industry, after the Battle of Dunkirk, it took four years of operation to exert national power to defeat the enemy. This is a lesson for the future. With this point of view, one knows that American aid to China is not only helping others, but also helping oneself.</p>
<p>Roxby and Lyde on China</p>
<p>Professor Percy Maude Roxby, the representative of the British Council in China, died in Nanjing in March this year. China lost a true friend. Roxby studied history at Oxford University in his early years, and after graduation, he studied geography with Professor A. J. Herbertson. In 1908, he was recommended by Herbertson to be a lecturer at the University of Liverpool, and was promoted to professor in 1917. For nearly forty years, his teachings were extensive. He came to China three times, first in early 1912, revisited in 1921, and came to the temporary capital with his wife in 1945, serving in the position of Sino-British cultural cooperation. He wrote many treatises on Far Eastern issues, and many sections on China in the *Encyclopædia Britannica* were also written by him, making great contributions to promoting understanding and sympathy between the two countries. He deeply loved Chinese philosophy and art, and was deeply concerned about the poverty of our country's rural areas. During the war, he wrote a book "China" for the reference of the British military authorities, and it is said that it will soon be published to the world. He was born in 1880 and lived to the age of sixty-seven.</p>
<p>Lionel William Lyde, a retired professor at the University of London, passed away in January of this year. He was born in 1863 and was eighty-four years old. He was one of the elder geographers of the United Kingdom, and was as famous as Herbertson and Mackinder, each making contributions. He was also a graduate of Oxford University, with a deep foundation in literature and history. In his early years, he wrote teaching materials, which were popular in the United Kingdom. He began lecturing at the University of London in 1903 and retired in 1928. His books, such as *The Continent of Europe* (1913) and *The Continent of Asia* (1933), are regarded as classics by scholars. He had a deep understanding of Chinese culture. According to Professor L. D. Stamp of the University of London, Lyde's geographical philosophy was actually influenced by Chinese thought.</p>
<p>Scholars of Roxby and Lyde's generation had very thorough insights into Chinese issues. They liked to compare China with Europe, because China's vast territory and large population are indeed comparable to the entire Europe. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, although there have been times of division and separation in China, it has always been able to maintain a unified scale. Since the decline of Rome, Europe has never been unified again, and the reason is worthy of deep thought. They believed that Chinese culture has its own advantages. Comparing Europe with China, one can know the difficulty of our nation-building cause. Our country's sages valued the balance of centrifugal force and centripetal force in their discussion of national affairs. Today's nation-building thought should still give play to this excellent tradition, on the one hand, making local autonomy vigorous, and on the other hand, making national unity a complete success, maintaining each other internally and externally, so as to consolidate the foundation of the country, and not disappoint the expectations of overseas confidants for us.</p>

<h3>Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company - Li Jing</h3>
<p>The earliest navigation organization in our country was the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was founded in the eleventh year of Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, and has been 75 years since then. At the beginning of its establishment, it had a basic scale; unfortunately, due to political and personnel reasons, progress was hindered. After the Republic of China, during the First World War, although our country had the opportunity to develop the shipping industry, due to the lack of government support and the squeezing out of foreign ships, the business did not get reasonable development. The government established its capital in Nanjing and attached importance to shipping construction. The Ministry of Transportation repeatedly sent people to reorganize it. Before the Incident in 1937, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a total of 53 large and small ships, totaling more than 80,000 tons. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the coastal areas were occupied, and all seagoing ships, in addition to undertaking transport for the government, were either sunk or destroyed, or temporarily transferred to foreign flags. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which moved westward into Sichuan during the war, had only more than 20 large and small river ships, totaling more than 25,000 tons. After the victory and recovery, the shipping rights were recovered. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company took over enemy and puppet ships and actively purchased Allied seagoing ships. The business expanded. As of now, there are a total of 460 ships, totaling more than 333,000 tons, which is a large increase compared with the war, and has also increased four times compared with the pre-war period. This is indeed the result of our country's arduous struggle, which is gratifying and comforting. Now, General Manager Xu Xueyu and all employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can all understand the importance of their responsibilities, and are working hard to promote it. Externally, they are clearing up debts, and internally, they are eliminating long-standing malpractices. The bureau's affairs are new, and the future is limitless, which is admired by colleagues in the transportation industry.</p>
<p>Our country's shipping policy adopts the principle of equal emphasis on state-owned and private enterprises. This is different from postal and telecommunications and railways. Therefore, state-owned shipping should be committed to undertaking arduous work, avoiding competing with private enterprises for profit, and supporting private shipping. The obvious advancement of this policy is that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company focused on developing ocean voyages after the war, hoping that private shipping companies would take on inland river voyages. Ocean shipping is related to international competition. If the state leads, it is easier to succeed. Now that Japan has been defeated, its shipping power in the Far East should be replaced by our country. To achieve this goal, it is hoped that state-owned enterprises will be the backbone, cooperate with private enterprises, and embrace the spirit of mutual assistance to move forward together, so as to keep pace with the world's shipping industry.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, we recall the grand plans of our predecessors in starting the business, are wary of the precedent of our country's shipping industry losing the opportunity to revitalize after the First World War, and look forward to the future of the shipping industry being renewed day by day. It is like an old man of 75 years old, who has already returned to his youth. Briefly describe the past and encourage the future. I sincerely express my views and hope that we can encourage each other.</p>
<h3>The Victory and Restoration of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: A General Overview of Operations</h3>
<p>— Hu Shiyuan</p>
<p>"State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company," the only state-owned shipping enterprise in China, was founded in the eleventh year of the reign of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (1872 AD), initially named "China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau." It was established by the Northern Ocean Minister and Governor-General Li Hongzhang on behalf of the Qing court, marking its 75th year. Over these 75 years, China has suffered from foreign invasions and unequal treaties. The growth of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been fraught with difficulties. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the company swiftly revived after suffering significant losses during the eight-year war. It not only restored its pre-war state but also significantly improved its operational capacity and transportation capabilities. Its development is of national interest, and a summary is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) Increase in Ships</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company possessed twelve river steamers with a total tonnage of 33,784.54 tons, sixteen ocean-going vessels with a total tonnage of 37,575.99 tons, twelve small vessels with a total tonnage of 1,120.33 tons, six iron barges, and seven motorized boats, totaling over 80,000 tons. During the war, nine ships were sunk by bombing, three were destroyed, and fifteen were requisitioned to block ports, resulting in heavy losses. After the victory, besides the ships preserved in the rear and those obtained from seized enemy and puppet assets, a large number of ocean-going vessels were purchased from abroad. As of recently, the company's fleet and tonnage are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ocean-going Vessels: 61 ships, 186,278.46 total tons</p>
<p>(2) River Steamers: 28 ships, 56,128.24 total tons</p>
<p>(3) Tugs and Small Vessels: 142 ships, 15,911.51 total tons</p>
<p>(4) Iron and Wooden Barges and Special Vessels: 229 ships, 74,840.64 total tons</p>
<p>Total: 460 ships, 333,644.63 total tons</p>
<p>(Note: The ship and tonnage figures in this article are based on statistics as of the end of November of this year, including the newly added "Chenggong," "Hongzhang," "Jiaoren," and "Tieqiao" vessels. The other data is based on statistics from the end of August, hence the discrepancy. Please note this, Editor.) The tonnage listed in the table above is approximately four times the pre-war tonnage. The increase in transportation capacity is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>(2) Distribution of Shipping Routes</p>
<p>After the victory, in addition to rapidly restoring shipping in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coastal ports, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company extended its routes to various locations abroad. Its current routes are as follows: A. Yangtze River Routes:</p>
<p>In addition to the above routes and ships, other ships and barges serve as support vessels, providing important transportation services, and some are engaged in barging operations in Tianjin and Shanghai. Because China Merchants Steam Navigation Company undertakes military, government, and commercial transportation, its workload is very heavy, and the number of ships is not sufficient to meet the needs. To open up overseas routes, a large number of new ships are needed. It is expected that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will have four passenger ships purchased from abroad and two passenger ships built by the Jiangnan Shipyard put into operation next year, which will meet some of the needs. To manage its operations, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has established branches and agencies at various locations domestically and abroad, as follows:</p>
<p>Chongqing Branch, Wanxian Office, Yichang Branch, Shashi Office, Hankou Branch, Changsha Office, Jiujiang Branch, Anqing Office, Wuhu Branch, Nanjing Branch, Zhenjiang Branch, Yingkou Branch, Huludao Branch, Qinhuangdao Office, Tianjin Branch, Tanggu Office, Yantai Office, Qingdao Branch, Haizhou Branch, Ningbo Branch, Zhenhai Office, Wenzhou Office, Fuzhou Office, Taipei Branch, Keelung Office, Kaohsiung Office, Xiamen Branch, Shantou Branch, Hong Kong Branch, Guangzhou Branch, Zhanjiang Office, Manila Agency, Haiphong Agency, Bangkok Agency, Singapore Agency, Yangon Agency, Kolkata Agency, Haikou Agency. Based on the distribution of the above routes and branch locations, the position of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the shipping industry is significant, and it has a considerable foundation. How to further develop and promote it is its main task.</p>
<p>(3) New Measures in Business Operations:</p>
<p>China's shipping industry has historically been backward. Besides the issue of poor equipment, there is much room for improvement in management. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has paid great attention to innovation. The following are some of the important measures:</p>
<p>(1) Thoroughly Destroying the Comprador System: In China's shipping industry, most of the legal systems refer to the rules of foreign merchants. The comprador system was created by foreign merchants, resulting in a special class of compradors who profited by acting as intermediaries and hindering business operations. To thoroughly overhaul its operations and shoulder the responsibility of developing China's shipping industry, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has completely eradicated the comprador system and similar systems, allowing no trace to remain. Currently, there is no comprador mentality among the staff of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is a key step in reforming the shipping industry.</p>
<p>(2) Reforming the Cargo Handling System: The cargo handling system in shipping is a byproduct of the comprador system. In the past, when shipping operations were handled by compradors, they hired cargo handling personnel who lived on the ships and handled cargo operations. The biggest drawback of this system was the increased number of personnel on board, occupying passenger berths, which increased expenses and wasted space. For companies with fewer ships, the losses were not significant, but for China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which owned many ships, it was uneconomical. Therefore, since 1947, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has gradually changed the cargo handling system from on-board to dockside. The original on-board cargo handling personnel were transferred to work onshore at various ports. Since the implementation of this system, many berths have been freed up on the ships, which can be used to transport passengers and increase passenger revenue. The efficiency of onshore cargo handling is much higher than that of on-board cargo handling. This reform can be considered a major innovation in China's shipping industry.</p>
<p>(3) Ship Service Staff: Hospitality and service are highly valued in modern hotel and transportation industries. Passengers need to enjoy comfort and convenience during their journeys. The mission of the ship service staff is to serve passengers and make them feel at home. To achieve this, it is not easy. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recognizes the importance of service and has established training classes to improve the service skills of the ship service staff. The goal is to ensure that every ship service staff member can effectively perform their duties and serve passengers diligently.</p>
<p>(4) Conducting Intermodal Transportation: To facilitate the long-distance sales of goods, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has partnered with the Pinghan Railway and the Great American Shipping Company to conduct intermodal transportation. Once the cargo is properly declared, shippers can obtain an intermodal bill of lading at the origin and use it to obtain bank financing. This is very convenient for merchants' capital turnover. However, overseas intermodal transportation has not been successful due to the lack of coordination between ship schedules and the need to settle some freight costs in foreign currency. This requires exporters and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to discuss and improve.</p>
<p>(5) Paying Attention to Passenger and Cargo Services: The nature of the transportation industry is to sell services. An enterprise that handles transportation without understanding service cannot be considered excellent. The goal of service is not only to meet the basic requirements of transportation, such as safety, speed, and comfort, but also to consider the needs of customers. Only then can it be considered to fulfill the spirit of service. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recognizes this and pays great attention to promoting service. For example, handling customs declarations and insurance for customers, providing car pick-up and delivery of passenger luggage, establishing ticket offices and waiting rooms at docks, information desks, and improving passenger and cargo handling procedures.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Modern world powers all pay attention to maritime transport to expand their national power and compete for the world market, as a plan for prosperity and strength. If China wants to talk about revival and construction, it must follow this path. After the war, the special privileges of foreign powers in inland navigation were abolished. China's shipping industry is thriving and has unlimited hope. Under the leadership of the government and with the assistance of all sectors, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has fortunately achieved a considerable scale. In the future, it should work harder to meet the expectations of the people. It is hoped that everyone will work together to make it the largest shipping organization in the Far East and make China a major maritime power in the world, which will benefit the country's future.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Xu Xueyu</p>
<p>The State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been established for seventy-five years. In these seventy-five long years, the changes in national affairs, the turmoil of the political situation, the gains and losses of diplomacy, the changes in organization, the replacements of personnel, the adjustments of facilities, and the rise and fall of business operations are all important pages in the history of China's transportation. On this anniversary, we review the past, respond to the present, and plan for the future. We feel infinitely excited. In addition to compiling a commemorative booklet, we have also attached a special edition to the Shen Bao, which has the same seventy-five-year history as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. We want to inform people who care about shipping about China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's reports, and to give us guidance, sympathy, and encouragement, so that we can work harder, so that the industry can cooperate more, and so that China's shipping industry can progress towards an ideal state.</p>
<p>In these seventy-five years, China's shipping industry has established some foundations in the equipment of docks and warehouses. However, in terms of the tonnage and performance of ships, as well as the equipment for shipbuilding and repair, it is not worth mentioning. Compared with other maritime countries in the world, it is even more unattainable. Today, when we reflect on ourselves, we only feel ashamed and vigilant. How dare we harbor any self-consolation or pride!</p>
<p>In the two years since the victory and restoration, China's shipping industry has gradually increased from less than 100,000 tons of ships to more than 850,000 tons, which can be said to be the fastest period of progress in history. This is certainly due to the wise policies of the government, but also to the assistance of friendly countries and the cooperation of the industry. If we continue to do so, our shipping industry will soon be able to compete with other maritime countries in the world. If the establishment of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can represent the development of China's shipping industry, then December 16 should not be a celebration of the birthday of an old man, but a celebration of the birth of a newborn baby. In the future, the growth and success of this child will depend on the love and care of the public.</p>
<h3>75th Anniversary of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>— Liu Hongsheng</p>
<p>Starting a business is difficult, maintaining it is not easy, and restoring it is even more difficult. Seventy-five years ago, when the maritime ban was lifted, foreign ships entered and exited China's coastal and inland rivers in an endless stream. Shipping companies were organized to control shipping. At this time, this bureau was established and purchased four ships to transport grain and commercial goods. Docks were purchased in Tianjin and Shanghai for storage and transfer. At that time, this bureau was still in its infancy. It was obstructed by sand ships and competed with foreign ships. Even when the bureau's ships were insured with foreign insurance companies, they were rejected for marine insurance. Fortunately, under the strong leadership of the Northern Ocean Minister Li Hongzhang, it was finally able to raise commercial shares, add ships, and acquire all the ships and docks of the American-owned Qi Chang Steamship Company. Sheng Xuanhuai was then appointed to supervise the bureau, and the bureau's affairs were carried out smoothly. The foundation of this bureau was laid. The difficulty of starting a business can be seen here.</p>
<p>After the foundation of this bureau was laid, it should have used its inherent human and financial resources to seek development. Unfortunately, the national strength was weak, and there were the Sino-French, Sino-Japanese, and Eight-Power Allied Forces wars, which caused the ships of this bureau to change flags repeatedly, and inland port navigation rights were opened up several times. Foreign shipping companies were assisted by their governments and dominated the seas of China. Although this bureau also added ships and docks one after another, it was not easy to compete with foreign shipping companies with strong financial resources. As a result, the business of the North and South Oceans and the Yangtze River routes was almost monopolized by foreign ships. In the last few years of the commercial operation period, business declined, debts were incurred, ships were old, and there were no funds for repairs. Maintaining the status quo was not possible, let alone development. The difficulty of maintaining a business is like this. When it was changed to state-run, Hongsheng took over as general manager. Fortunately, under the leadership of Minister Zhu, a loan was borrowed from the Sino-British Gengkuan to build four ocean-going vessels, and the Haiyun vessel was also purchased with a loan. However, five old vessels were also taken out of service because they were not able to operate. The tonnage remained the same. Three years passed, and I was ashamed that there were no achievements, so I retreated to a more qualified person. Not long after, the Anti-Japanese War broke out. Some of the ships of this bureau were sunk by themselves, some were destroyed by enemy aircraft, and some were sold to British merchants. There were only eighteen ships of all sizes left, and some of them had always traveled in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The ships were large and had deep drafts, so they could not be used in the Sichuan River. In this extraordinary period, it was almost impossible to defend anything. This bureau encountered many difficulties. Looking back on the past, there was a feeling of being in a storm.</p>
<p>Fortunately, two years before the victory, the United Kingdom and the United States abolished unequal treaties and recovered navigation rights. Later, the Japanese surrendered, and Japanese ships disappeared from China's territorial waters. This was a great opportunity to restore the business of this bureau. During the recovery period, this bureau bore the mission of military and public transportation, which was extremely important. Fortunately, General Manager Xu had the belief that the Anti-Japanese War would be won before the Japanese surrendered. The small and large river steamers in Chongqing were repaired with loans. After the victory, the recovery work was successfully completed. His foresight is evident. Since this bureau moved to Shanghai, General Manager Xu has followed the instructions of the Ministry of Communications, and colleagues, under the leadership of General Manager Xu, have worked hard to seize the opportunity and bury themselves in hard work. Now, in terms of ships: including the ships ordered by the government from the United States and Canada, there are 330,000 tons; in terms of wharves: during the occupation, the docks and warehouses were damaged and unusable. After the recovery, they were repaired one by one, and four wharves were leased from the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for business use; in terms of business: in addition to restoring the Yangtze River North and South Ocean routes, new routes were opened up to Bangkok, Calcutta, Singapore, Manila, Japan, South America and other places. The business is booming. In addition, the rectification of wharf order, the abolition of tips, and the implementation of the wharf cargo handling system are all important measures to restore the business of this bureau. It is booming, like the rising sun, full of the atmosphere of new life. General Manager Xu is restoring private shipping companies, working together, with the goal of co-prosperity, and taking on the full responsibility of the entire transportation. With this perseverance, the future development is unlimited. However, the difficult operation of the authorities is even more difficult than starting a business. Today is the 75th anniversary of this bureau. Hongsheng is a director and is very honored to attend this event. Looking at the past and thinking about the present, I will briefly describe my feelings. I am especially ashamed that I am old and sick, and I have not been able to contribute my strength.</p>

<h3>The Significance and Methods of Establishing a Shipping Scholarship</h3>
<p>— Tang Xin</p>
<p>All the employees of this bureau, in view of the rapid progress of shipping restoration after the war, and the urgent need for shipping talents, which cannot be achieved without speeding up large-scale training, take the opportunity of this bureau's 75th anniversary to initiate a donation scholarship movement, borrowing the meaning of a hundred-year tree, to congratulate the eternal existence and continuous development of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.

<h3>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Over Seventy-Five Years and its Leaders Through the Ages</h3>
<p>— Wang Shaozeng</p>
<p>Due to limited space, this article is divided into seven major periods for narration:</p>
<p>(I) The Founding Period (1872-1884)</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Beiyang (later promoted to Grand Secretary) of the waning Qing Dynasty, believing that shipping could defend against foreign aggression and benefit merchants, resolved to establish the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. After repeated preparations, in the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872), he appointed Zhu Qiang and Zhu Qizhao to Shanghai to plan capital, purchase ships, and select routes, officially opening the bureau on the sixteenth day of the twelfth month. In the initial years, although the number of ships owned by the bureau was small, the routes were very long, centered on Shanghai, going east to Kobe and Nagasaki, south to Hong Kong and Shantou, and north to Tianjin and Dagu. British companies such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire, and the American company Russell &amp; Co., which were already engaged in shipping in our country, were deeply jealous and repeatedly lowered prices to compete. At one point, the bureau was almost unable to sustain itself. Fortunately, Grand Secretary Li stipulated that all grain tribute must be transported by bureau ships, which enabled it to safely overcome the crisis. Russell &amp; Co. suffered huge losses due to excessive price reductions and could not continue, so in the third year of Guangxu, it sold all of its assets, including ships and warehouses, to the bureau. From then on, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company grew stronger day by day. The leaders of this period initially included Zhu Qiang and his brother, followed by Sheng Xuanhuai, Tang Tingshu, and Xu Run. Under the wise planning and leadership of Li Hongzhang, they worked hard and devoted themselves to the bureau's affairs, laying the foundation for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<p>(II) The Development Period (1884-1900)</p>
<p>After the Sino-French maritime conflict arose, bureau ships were unable to operate. A contract was once signed with Russell &amp; Co. to sell the ships to the company for management, but after the war ended, they were reclaimed. This period lasted for sixteen years. Initially, business was smooth due to a price agreement with Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson. New ships were added, old ships were repaired, and warehouses and wharves were built in various navigable locations in our country. At the same time, investments were made in establishing the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank and exploiting coal mines in Tangshan, Pingxiang, and Dongliu. The bureau's affairs developed, increasing day by day. The Qing government, recognizing that the bureau had maintained itself with difficulty since its establishment and had been able to handle the transportation of troops and relief supplies quickly and appropriately, established incentive measures such as exempting 20% of the Beiyang export tax, reducing tea transportation tax, and increasing grain tribute transportation fees, all of which were sufficient to encourage the bureau to move forward. The leaders of this period, in addition to the death of Tang Tingshu, were mostly overseen by Sheng Xuanhuai, with Ma Jianzhong, Xie Jiafu, Shen Nenghu, and Gu Zhaoxi co-responsible.</p>
<p>(III) The Decline Period (1900-1911)</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang, the sole founder of the bureau, died of exhaustion in Beijing in the 27th year of Guangxu (1901) while negotiating the Boxer Protocol. Yuan Shikai, as the Minister of Beiyang, sent Yang Shiqi to the bureau as general manager, and Sheng Xuanhuai retired for a time. The shareholders' meeting was held in the first year of Xuantong, and a board of directors was established. Sheng Xuanhuai and eight others were elected as the first directors. However, at this time, revolutionary rumors were spreading everywhere, and the Qing government sent bureau ships to transport troops and grain frequently. Furthermore, the Dangshun, Haichen, and Xiehe ships successively encountered accidents and sank. Although the bureau was placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Posts and Communications in the first year of Xuantong and new regulations were established for reorganization, the country was in turmoil, and it was difficult to expect revitalization. By the time the Republic of China was established, the bureau had accumulated huge losses over the years and owed millions of taels.</p>
<p>(IV) The Revival Period (1912-1927)</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Republic of China, a national harvest occurred, and there was an urgent need to transport local goods from various places, thus increasing business. In addition to adding the Jianghua ship in the first year of the Republic, the other ships were all extensively repaired. A new board of directors was established, with Yang Shiqi and Sheng Xuanhuai elected as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. Three departments—shipping, business, and accounting—were established, with directors Tang Dexi, Chen You, and Shi Yijue serving as department heads. In the third year of the Republic, the Jiyu Property Company was re-established to manage the bureau's assets unrelated to shipping. Sheng Xuanhuai passed away from illness in the spring of the fifth year of the Republic. Sheng had been in office for more than thirty years, carefully planning and working hard. His contributions were truly undeniable.</p>
<p>During the middle of this period, World War I occurred, and foreign ships returned west. The bureau was almost the only shipping organization in China, and the prosperity of its business can be imagined. By the end of World War I, the number of bureau ships had increased from 26 to 39. At the same time, warehouses, wharves, and city houses were built and purchased, and the China Merchants Public School was established to facilitate the education of bureau employees' children.</p>
<p>During this period, Sheng Xuanhuai and Yang Shiqi initially presided over the bureau's affairs, followed by Sun Baoqi, Li Guojie, and Sheng Chongyi. Aside from the chaotic situation at the end of the period, this was truly the bureau's revival period.</p>
<p>(V) The Reform Period (1927-1937)</p>
<p>After the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition captured Wuhan, it planned to reorganize the bureau's affairs. Yang Quan was ordered to come and "handle the affairs of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company." The government established its capital in Nanjing and appointed Zhang Jingjiang and ten others to organize the "Committee for Investigation and Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company" to audit accounting records and investigate business conditions. Detailed investigations were conducted on coal purchases, ship rentals, and inland river bureaus. In the seventeenth year, the bureau was formally reorganized, and the ministry appointed Zhao Tieqiao as director-general. After Zhao arrived at the bureau, he immediately engaged in major reforms, establishing a navigation school, dismissing foreign sailors, abolishing the Jiyu Company, and improving the accounting system. Unfortunately, on July 24th of the nineteenth year, he was assassinated by thugs and died in the line of duty. After Zhao's death, the ministry appointed Cai Pei as director-general, but he was soon succeeded by Chen Xizeng. Both of their terms in office were very short.</p>
<p>In November of the twenty-first year, the Executive Yuan issued an order to convert the bureau into a state-owned enterprise, and the Central Bank repurchased the shares at a price. Liu Hongsheng was appointed as the first general manager. During his three years in office, Liu borrowed Boxer Indemnity funds to add four ships, the Haiyuan, Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen, and spared no effort in reorganizing the bureau's affairs. After Liu resigned, the ministry appointed Cai Zengji as general manager.</p>
<p>(VI) The War of Resistance Period (1937-1945)</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a portion of the bureau's personnel followed the National Government westward, via Hankou to Chongqing, forming the Yangtze River Business Management Office responsible for inland river shipping. Former General Manager Cai led another portion of the personnel to Hong Kong to establish an office. Not long after, the area fell, and most of the original archives and accounts were lost in Hong Kong. All of the Yangtze River and ocean-going ships, except for the four ships Yuanheng, Lizhen, sold to British company Jardine Matheson, and the six major Yangtze River ships, Jiangshun etc., and seven small ships barely able to sail to Sichuan, were either requisitioned to block the harbor, bombed by enemy aircraft, or seized by the enemy, resulting in heavy losses.</p>
<p>In the spring of the thirty-second year, Zhu Yangpu, as Minister of Communications, believed that military transportation during the war needed to be strengthened, and postwar reconstruction also awaited planning. The bureau's affairs could not be interrupted, so he ordered the bureau to resume operations in Chongqing, appointing Xu Xueyu as general manager. Thus, the bureau officially resumed operations on April 26th. After Xu took office, he sent seven small ships to assist with river transport on the Sichuan River on one hand, and repaired the six major Yangtze River ships one by one on the other hand, while retaining the employees on the ships to maintain operations. Therefore, after the Japanese surrendered, the bureau immediately took on the responsibility of military and public repatriation transport on the Yangtze River, all due to careful planning in advance.</p>
<p>(VII) Current Situation (1945-1947)</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, the bureau's personnel came to Shanghai in early September of the thirty-fourth year. Under the joint planning and guidance of General Manager Xu Xueyu and Deputy General Managers Shen Zhongyi, Hu Shiyuan, and Wei Huanzhang, many bureau affairs have been organized and innovated in the past two years. These are briefly described in eight major categories as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Taking over enemy and puppet shipping assets and U.S. and Canadian ships—When ordered to recover after the war, the enemy shipping assets (including ships and real estate, etc.) were taken over. Except for a portion necessary for national shipping, which was purchased from the China Trust Bureau, the others were exchanged with or on behalf of that bureau for ships. The total tonnage of ships received in Shanghai was 60,000 tons, so the total tonnage of the bureau's ships is now 326,800 tons.</p>
<p>(B) Responsible for repatriation water transport—After the victory, banditry was rampant in various places. Seventy to eighty percent of the bureau's ships were allocated for military transportation, and the remainder was mostly used to transport rice from Sichuan and Jiangxi, sugar and rice from Taipei, salt from Qingdao, and to send Japanese nationals back to their country, assisting in the transportation of public education personnel and displaced civilians returning to their hometowns.</p>
<p>(C) Clearing old debts—Before the war, in order to compete with the powers in shipping and maintain the situation, loans were taken out from various Chinese and foreign banks, resulting in almost all of the bureau's assets being mortgaged. After two years of active repayment, all debts have now been cleared.</p>
<p>(D) Repairing ships, docks, and warehouses—Various ships were too dilapidated or unsuitable for use and needed to be repaired. After eight years of war, bureau buildings and docks in various places were severely damaged and have been repaired in order of urgency.</p>
<p>(E) Eliminating old habits—The name of the ship's "tea room attendant" was changed to "waiter," training was implemented, and the practice of collecting tips was strictly prohibited. The contracting and labor arrangements for docks were abolished and replaced with self-managed labor, establishing a new atmosphere.</p>
<p>(F) Expanding routes—In addition to dispatching dedicated ships to regularly operate the Yangtze River, Nanyang (Southeast Asia), and Beiyang (Northern China) lines, overseas lines were added, dispatching ships to India, the Philippines, Thailand, and Burma, benefiting from barter trade and increasing national glory.</p>
<p>(G) To facilitate passenger transport, a service committee was established, and a reception center was set up at the dock to facilitate passengers waiting for ships, providing shuttle trucks for picking up and dropping off passengers, and ferry services across the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>(H) Investing in the establishment of the China Tanker Company and the Taiwan Shipping Company, and maintaining close contact with private shipping companies, mutually benefiting from cooperation.</p>
<p>From now on, it will be a period of revitalization for China's shipping industry. Because shipping rights have been recovered, the opportunity for the development of the shipping industry is better, and the responsibilities are also greater. "Striving for Self-Improvement" is what all of us in the shipping industry should encourage each other to do.</p>
<h3>Riding the Ship Today</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>It has been more than two years since the victory. Ships flying the national flag have long taken on the heavy responsibility of domestic shipping after the war. But when it comes to "riding the ship," I am afraid you will still think of the chaos on the dock, the difficulty of buying tickets, the arrogance of the ship's tea room attendants, and the rampant spread of various bad habits and陋規. The lingering fear of this long nightmarish experience cannot but make you feel like you are寸步難行.</p>
<p>Recently, you may be乘船 again. If you are riding a ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company today, I believe you will definitely have a different feeling—a feeling that makes you feel a little安慰 in today's environment.</p>
<p>Speaking of the difficulty of buying ship tickets, it used to be too much and too terrible. Although the biggest reason is that there are too few ships and too many passengers, it is an undeniable fact that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company delayed the improvement of management in this area while it was busy with repatriation. Today, when you step into their ticket office, although you still see a constant stream of guests, there is no squeezing and chaos that you expected. The renovated ticket office does appear spacious and convenient. When you see that there are still vacancies on the passenger seat牌掛 on the wall, you can quickly buy your ship ticket. If you are late, the ladies at the information desk will ask you to leave your address and register for the next ship ticket. They will answer your questions in detail and诚懇ly help you solve your difficulties. Needless to say, black market tickets will never exist there.</p>
<p>On the dock of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the dark secrets and chaotic situation that plagued you in the past have also been thoroughly rectified. They have further established passenger reception centers on the docks, which are decorated neatly and generously. It is really too urgent for passengers who have just come down from the ship to find a quiet place to recover from the fatigue of the journey. Passengers waiting for the ship on the dock also need a place to rest and shelter from the wind and rain. If you have ample time and the ship has not yet启錨, you and your friends can also go there to sit for a while and have some hot refreshments. There is a播音器 there that will report the departure time at any time. When you pay the bill, you will be sure to find that the price you pay is much cheaper than you imagined.</p>
<p>On the ship, what you are most afraid of seeing is probably the arrogant "tea room attendant" that you used to see. Well, now the people接待ing you are a group of "waiters" who have been rigorously trained. They are attentive, humble, and know how to take care of elderly and young passengers getting on the ship, and how to make you feel comfortable and satisfied.</p>
<p>The "food" on the ship may be the point you are most concerned about. Now, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has appointed a catering expert who once studied in the UK to be responsible for the ship's meals. He has frankly admitted that he cannot make the ship's dishes suit the tastes of every passenger, but he is striving to achieve the three points of "cleanliness," "nutrition," and "deliciousness." When you have another chance to try it, you will definitely not be disappointed, and you will recognize that his words are not an un兑現ed check.</p>
<p>When you look at the long and large sea surface on the deck, you can't help but feel a burst of inexplicable岑寂. Maybe you will feel the need for some entertainment to pass the time. Of course, on the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company today, things like gambling are already悬掛為例. But you can find the books, newspapers, and magazines that you like. On several ships, broadcasting equipment has been installed to转播 various important news, ship dynamics, and pleasant music. When you have a book in your hand and quietly listen to beautiful songs and famous songs, will you believe that you are on a ship? On a Chinese ship?</p>
<p>Your health and safety are also what they are concerned about. Although the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company do not yet have medical equipment like hospitals, the emergency medicines needed by passengers on a short voyage have been prepared very completely.</p>
<p>Your comfort and satisfaction, whether you live in first class or fourth class, are the goals that the various management departments of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are trying to improve day and night. In the process of their efforts, the difficulties they encounter are arduous. There are still so few passenger ships, and material resources are so difficult. If we recognize reality and do not ask for perfection, their achievements are of course worthy of揚. But to help them achieve a more perfect future, I am afraid we still need our greater assistance and策勵.</p>
