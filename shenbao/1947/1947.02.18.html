<h3>安定民生緊急措施　國府明令嚴格執行　人民在國外存款總數逾三億美元　名單已調查自行申報</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕國府十七日命令，本府茲鍳於當前經濟情形足以影響全體國民生計，釀成社會重大不安，特制定「經濟緊急措施方案」，提出國防最高委員會第二一八次常務會議，決議「（一）修正通過，（二）在各該辦法內關於處罰部分，併交立法院補定立法程序，（三）凡中華民國之人民，公司或團體存有外匯在外國者，應向政府自行申報，此項外匯存款，除有合法用途者外，應由政府定期按照法定匯率收買，其不申報或拒收買及收存於本國銀行者，應嚴予處罰，其詳細實施辦法，由行政院迅即擬訂呈核」，除分行外，合行抄發各該關係文件，令仰激照辦理，並轉飭所屬一體負責切實遵辦，嚴格執行，為要，此令。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕經濟緊急措施方案公布後，各方反饗極佳。經濟政策研究委會日內將再開會，續商有關安定民生穩定金融之根本辦法。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕對平抑物價，政府已具最大決心，將嚴格執行經濟緊急措施方案，切實管制物價，除引導游資投資於生產事業外，嚴防奸商囤積居奇，操縱物價，對於此類行為之商人，將嚴重處罰。</p>
<p>〔又電〕四聯總處十七日下午開臨時會議，出席者，有各國家行局負責人，會商嚴格執行「加強金融業務管理辦法」各項放款，以協助民生必需品及出口物資之增產為主。數額在五千萬元以上即需經四聯總處核定，否則不得承放，並對各放款案件事前調查及放款用途之考核，由經辦行局切實負責辦理，而各行局多餘款項應一律存放中央銀行，不得以買匯貼現及其地方式以資金轉放省市銀行或商業行莊。軍政及國營事業機關支用存款時，一律使用抬頭支票，必需提取現款時，應註明用途。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國人存放國外之外匯總數逾三億美元，存戶名單政府已有調查。存款人若不自行申報，則必要時政府將公布其名單，並予懲處。又一部份經濟專家認為與其由政府按法定匯率收買，不若由政府借用為愈。另一部專家則主張用長期公債方法，收　此類存款。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕匯率提高至一萬二千元後，僑匯送港問題，可不致如過去嚴重，僑委會週前曾會同海外部，財部國庫署，中，中，交，農四行商定僑匯貼補辦法，決定採進出口貼補辦法補助百分之百，惟自緊急措施方案發表，此一一辦法已無實施必要。</p>
<h3>各地銀樓均停業　財部擬處理辦法　平漢昆台北物價多下跌</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕政府公布金鈔停止公開買賣後，十七日晨起，京市各金店銀樓及美鈔買賣商店一律閉門停市。據聞係公會方面分別口頭通知，並定即日下午集會討論飾金是否繼續買賣問題。據社局長謝徵孚語人，此為政府實行緊急措施後之必然現象。局方決遵政府指示辦理，對各號停業決不予以重視。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕此間經營美鈔之錢兌店的十家，因政府下令禁止外幣交易，已自動除下其玻璃招牌。據某大銀樓職員稱，南京約有大銀樓四十家若政府永久禁售金銀首飾，則銀樓業職工因此失業者將達二千人。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕銀樓業及首飾店製成金飾之處理辦法，正由財政部草擬中，即將公佈施行。今日京市各銀樓及外幣券兌換店，均舖門深鎖，停止營業。央行京分行因尚未舉到上海總行命令，本日並未開始收購外幣券及掛牌收購黃金。今日物價無若何波動。</p>
<p>〔本報無錫十七日電〕今日全邑各銀樓一律停業。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口十七日電〕此間接獲政府管制金融消息後，條錠交易即告停止，各金號多未開門，僅少數金飾店尚有零星買賣，其他各項物價均持平，動盪之人心已趨平穩。</p>
<p>〔中央社昆明十七日電〕昆市各金號今均停止活動，金業公會召開緊急會議。本日起黃金外幣已無行市，棉紗布疋受金業停頓影饗，價格一致回落。大美亨布（疋）三十六萬元，百貨仍趨堅俏，米糧下挫，上米（石）五萬八千元。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十七日電〕最高國防委會決定經濟緊急措置停止黃金買賣提高外匯後，杭市銀樓全部停業，街頭收購黃金之游擊商人亦告歛跡，而洋貨上漲，報紙每令又到十五萬。日用品亦蠢然欲動，米價今高呼十三萬。一般市民又喜又愁，一如今日陰沉下雪之天氣。</p>
<h3>杭配售平價米</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十七日電〕杭市民食日趨嚴重，尤以公敎人員為最。經省府撥穀十萬石，交民食調節委會以平價米方式配售，民心稍安。茲悉，已由財廳電飭富春江流域及沿滬杭綫各縣即運五萬石穀來杭，預計三月間可望回到七萬三千。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕政府經濟緊急措施公布後，平市一般物價均徵落，如平產最高麪粉落至六萬八千元一袋。惟購戶意存觀望，甚少成交，黃金美鈔禁正流通命令尚未到平，故今兌換業照常應市。美鈔出一萬二千四百，進一萬二千，黃金暗盤六十四萬。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北十七日電〕經濟緊急措施方案公佈後，台灣米糧及物價均稍平穩。米每斤三十六元，一級白糖每斤九十五元。百物狂漲期間台省公營事業均未漲價，陳儀長官且令火車自來水及電力三項事業减價百分之十。陳氏認為非公營事業之各項物價，亦應抑低。今下午令民政處召集台北市各業同業公會商討議價事宜，冀使日來在漲之物價，逐漸降低，台北銀行購買黃金及收兌美鈔。今日掛牌，黃金每兩台幣一萬一千五，美欽一百五十八元，港幣卅四元，惟無交易。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州十七日電〕蘇省府頃電令縣府謂，京滬沿綫各縣日用品價格不得超過上海之百分之七十，否則惟各該行政長官是問。現蘇縣府已着手調查平抑。</p>
<h3>法幣在港　行情轉好</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港十七日電〕中國政府之緊急管制金融方案宣布後，法幣在港行情轉好，今晨開盤法幣十萬元，等於港幣四十一元，上星期六之行情則為法幣十萬元易港幣三十七元又二分之一。金價則已下降，開盤每盎斯港幣二七七元，上星期六收盤價為每盎斯二九一元。此間某華人銀行家告本社記者稱，新方案是否能奏效，尚屬懐疑，尤以令持有外幣者，以官價兌換法幣一點，恐更難有普遍之響應。</p>
<h3>立院會　定後日舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕立院三一五次會，定廿日上午九時舉行，廿一日將續開會，並請宋院長子文蒞院報告，開會通知昨已發出。</p>
<h3>嚴防黃金　走私出國</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕政府公布之經濟緊急措施辦法中，有禁止携帶黃金條塊出國境，違者沒收充公一項，頃悉：財部已分電各海關一切囑　防黃金走私出國。</p>
<h3>新運十三週紀念前夕　主席向全國廣播　昨在中樞紀念週致訓先說明重要性　勗勉提高精神道德力量</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕新生活運動十三週年紀念前夕（十八日）下午八時，蔣主席向全國廣播，屆時由中央廣播電台以中波「四五四」公尺，「六六〇」千週短波，「三〇·八」公尺，「九七三〇」千週及「二五·三五」公尺，「一一八三五」千週同時播送，並由全國各地廣播電合準時轉播。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中樞十七日上午九時舉行擴大國父紀念週，蔣主席領導行禮如儀後，即席致訓詞，就建國工作現階段之形勢，說明新生活運動之重要性，茲摘錄訓詞大意如后：</p>
<p>後天（十九日）即為新生活運動之十三週年紀念，我另有文告勗勉全國同胞，今天特光對各位同人提起注意，新生活運動發起之初，賴命國同胞努力實行，使社會風氣為之丕變，廿六年政府決心抗戰，即以新生活運動為主要的精神力量之一，後來全國同胞激勵奮發，卒能擊敗敵寇者實為新生活運動實行之明騐也。然本人發起新生活運動之目的，不僅資以抵禦外侮，而尤視此為建設國家之基本工作。國父有言，「精神重於物質］革命必先革心」，我國歷代政治家的施政，亦以移風易俗為先務，因國家之　礎在於社會，社會如不能樹立良好的風氣，國民如不能習於現代的生活，則國家決不能現代化。但自抗戰結束以來，敵偽餘毒未能滌除，國家秩序未能安定，以至風氣頹靡，精神消沉，人心陷溺，社會墮落，投機取巧者，自以為能，縱慾敗度者，恬不知恥，禮義廉恥掃地無餘。上海最近發生之金融風潮，即其明證，故在今日允非厲行新生活運動，提高精神道德的力量，不足以挽救社會之危機。</p>
<p>新生活遝動之要義，在納禮義康恥四維於日常生活之中，故新生活運動之實行，必自衣食住行的改造作起，人人要檢查自己的生活·行動，是否符合新生活運動中所舉之簡單·樸素·整齊·淸潔·迅速·確實六個條件，我黨政軍人員，允當以身作則，澈底實行，由本身推及家庭，推及所主持之機關，推及於整個社會，如此始能造成一種積極向上的新風氣，而形成建國之力量。主席最後提及南京之市容，以為與抗戰以前比較，相去甚遠，市政府·警察局及社會·衛生兩局，今後必須督促谷保甲，發動民衆力量，力求改進，第一步尤須嚴禁隨地便溺，隨地吐痰，以保持本市之淸潔衛生，決不可認此等事為小節，而不加注意，須知文野之分，即在此點，我們必先做到整齊·淸潔，然後始能談到其他建設。</p>
<h3>參政會駐委會　檢討經濟措施　通過六項辦法送請政府核辦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕參政會駐委會，十七日晨九時舉行臨時會，莫德惠，傳斯年等出席，江南主席，檢討十六日政府公布之經濟緊急措施方案，對平抑物價一項，討論甚詳盡，認為物價平抑應依本年元旦之指數，不能再予增加，對美鈔之調整價格驟增四倍，認為不當，政府應鄭重考慮。國人在國外之存款，主張律由政徴借，旋即就審查會所送來對財政·經濟業經整理之提案予以討論，並即通過，即日送政府核辦，原文如次：（一）此次黃金風潮，行政院長以及有關當局不能預為防止，貽誤國計民生至鉅，應請國防最高委會查明責任，認眞處分。（二）建議政府由本會及立法院·監察院會同組織調查團，澈查此次黃金風潮，京·滬兩地金融現况與官僚資本壟斷作祟情形。（三）政府應妥定辦法，吸收游資，用於生產事業。為促進生產事業之切實發展，凡生產貸款有經手中飽及移作投機用途者，應嚴辦之。（四）凡利用公款·聯權，從事非法牟利者（包括延期發薪以牟利者），應嚴厲取締。（五）日用必需品應採有效辦法全面管制，並須實行節約，禁止浪費。（六）復速制定平抑物價辦法，切實施行，務期恢復一月份物價標準。</p>
<h3>緊急措施反響良好　京中人士認為係輿論勝利</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十七日電〕據京方中立人士之意見，認為政府新金融經濟措施，乃輿論之勝利。據渠等指稱，此種　峻措施，早為公正與論之所要求，而一直為官僚及旣得利益集團所阻止，直至最後由蔣主席個人出而干涉始實現。又稱：政府此次乃屬最大阻與無所不包之應付經濟情形措施，但其前途如何，尚不可樂觀，因其成效尚有待於實施如何也。因此，渠等指出，新措施之實施，乃政府面臨之行政效率之最大試騐。吾人須視政府是否有充分力量禁止黃金美鈔之賣買，控制黑市投機牟利，貯藏黃金，凍結黃金，日用必需品之力量，以及恢復一月之生活指數之水準。</p>
<p>樓桐孫談措施方案</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕立院經濟委會主席樓桐孫今談稱，最高國防委會通過經濟緊急措施方案，足見政府已認識經濟危機及其解決方法。樓氏在立院中首先主張禁止黃金及外幣交易。據稱，方案中各項措施，如能忠實　行，對於安定國民經濟，當可收效。政府決定徴集華人在國外所存資產，以購買糧食及主要貨物，此舉允應讚美。據美國財政部報告，一九四一年六月，華人在美序款，不下三億五千六百四十萬美元。此項外匯如由政府收購，在建設方面必可大有供獻。政府對於私人公司工廠之生產貨款，極應嚴密監督其用途，過去常有利用貸款作投機交易者。另一立法委員簡貫三，擁護樓氏統制黃金外幣主張。據稱，此項經濟緊急措施方案，係根據過去政府在經濟方面所受之痛苦經騐，實行增加生產，以裕稅收，簡化行政，以節經費之口號；其主要目的則在减少中國通貨膨脹程度。關於收買華人在美存款一節，簡氏提出進一步建議，主張政府應立請美。各銀行暫時凍結華人所有存款及證券，以待中國政府發行十年至二十年之公債加以收買，簡氏竭力反對用法幣收買外匯存款，因大量法幣泛濫全國，必致危害人民生活云。</p>
<p>徐傳霖氏兩點感想</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃晤民社黨要員徐　霖氏，詢以對經濟緊急措施方案有何感想？答謂：「本人不習經濟未能提出精當之意見，但就大處而論，有兩點感想：（一）目前之一切措施，應先求安定人心，吾則人心浮動，對物價有推波助瀾之作用；同時實行時應注意效能，以免引起有作用之抨擊，再度損害政府之信用；（二）外鈔之禁止在我國市塲上流通，實為必要，一則任何主權國家，在其本國境內只能使用本國之貨幣；二則我國經八載苦戰，一切殘破，經濟力量絕不能與美國相比擬，在此時期如有美鈔在國內流通，而一切物價以之為尺度時，則法幣一經比較，其購買力自更形慘跌。記得英人收復馬來亞時，立即宣布日本所發行之七十億軍用票作廢，另發新幣以供使用。此舉甚為「毒辣」，華僑吃虧甚大，但純就技術上言，亦有其成功之處，蓋不願在新收復區經濟未穩定之時，本國之貨幣有一比較之標準存在。嚴格而論，外幣之流通在勝利後即應禁止，不待今日。</p>
<p>孫九錄評經濟政策</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕立委孫九錄，頃評述政府之黃金外匯政策，略謂：目前中國金融危機，經濟恐慌情形，除客觀不可抗制之原因所造成無法避免外，歷來行政當局應負政策上錯誤之責任，右最大之兩點：（一）孔祥熙長財政部時代，將美匯釘住於法幣二十元，形成物價與匯價相距至數千倍之不合理狀況，政府所得利益為外幣來中國可討此小便利，而中國人亦有很多不正當之外匯，用二十元結美金一元逃出中國，後來外匯一提，物價一跳，物價與匯價之比率，永遠不能使之合理。匯價如不提高，外國貨廉價進口，本國生產事業永遠無法立足，此乃孔應負之政策上錯誤責任。（二）宋子文於勝利後提高美匯匯價，但無限制供應進口商外匯，致外貨充斥市塲，使本國生產事業不能生存。這一年來，外匯可說是枉費，實在是國家之損失，到不可收拾以後，才用輸人限額分配辦法，實已太晚，這是宋應負之政策上錯誤　任。至政府出售黃金，原意在收縮通貨，抑制物價，本人自始即認為辦不到，故在渝時即不贊成採此政策，今日政府決定央行不再拋售黃金，實不待今日早應辦理之峯，此與黃金國有不同，國有須在政治安定，幣値穩定之後，方能不失信用於人民，現在政府停止出售黃金，就是設政府暫不規定黃金之法幣價格，而任憑人民把民問所有的黃金視為貴重奢侈品保存，黃金不能吃，不能穿，醉迷黃金，而有游資者，聽其高價去買，何嘗不可。但唯一的條件是在　生日用物品價格之穩定，使其不再依賣金之價格漲落，此乃政府嚴重之任務。</p>
<h3>彭部長重要聲明　駁正外電曲解主席談論</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕彭部長學沛，十七午夜發表談話如下：「余頃接由美發來美國報紙所載聯合社南京二月十五日電，該電包含若干錯誤與歪曲；其中一部份內容，似摘取於蔣主席對數位美國報館社長·主筆所作之非正式談論，乃完全改變其意義。</p>
<p>聯合社謂：「接近蔣主席方面談稱，蔣主席責備美國決定停止供給軍器與貸款予中國，以致延長中國之內戰」云云。余當時在座，余覺對此不得不即作嚴正之更正。蔣主席於談話中並不否認美國停售軍　或停給借款之權利，但表示渠不願公開之意見。謂公開宣布以中國組織包含共產黨之聯合政府為售賣軍器供給貸款之條件，則使中共態度愈變強硬，而拒絕與政府作任何談判。以此語改為蔣主席　備美國延長中國內戰，顯係歪曲。</p>
<p>聯合社電又謂蔣主席之親信謂，主席認定，如美國會繼續供給軍火及借款，共產黨問題應可解決較速，而其軍隊可擊破共軍。此說當亦係根據主席之上述談論，其為歪曲，至為明顯。</p>
<p>至聯合社所引某高級方面所談，謂蔣主席深恨其議論未能轉移杜魯門總統及馬歇爾將軍，此語無隻字為將主席所曾提及。</p>
<p>聯合社電又謂，蔣主席嚴峻拒絕收受中共政治領袖所提之文件，此想係指中共所謂否認政府所訂條約之文件，當時國府主管收發人員，認為以一政黨而否認政府對外條約，殊嫌怪誕不經，故將文件退還。』</p>

<h3>八年戰爭破壞　中國損失鉅重　聯合國秘書處提報告</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十六日電〕聯合國秘書處已提出一報告草案，詳述中國八年來所遭戰爭破壞之慘狀，此項報告，係作爲戰爭災區遠東工作組下月向經濟社會理事會提交報告之根據例則，此報告全文尚未公佈，但確悉，此項龐大文件，包括遠東戰災之一般調查，以及各別國家之情况，該報告中關於中國情况如下：</p>
<p>人口死亡九百萬　房屋缺四千萬間</p>
<p>（一）生活狀况及人力，據估計戰爭死亡者，達九百萬，同時由於戰爭關係，死於疾病及受傷者，達數百萬人，而刦後餘生者，由於窮困，營養不良，及生活艱苦，被迫離鄉流亡，同時由於敎育之缺乏，其身心兩方面，所受之損害甚巨，且其中多數由於交通運輸之脫節，以及憤况之不安定，迄不能重返家園。（二）房屋問題，除上海一地外，中國目前所需房屋，據估計當在四千萬間以上。</p>
<p>學校設備極不敷　衣着匱乏難恢復</p>
<p>（三）敎育，戰爭時，中國淪陷區內教育設備曾遭日本人破壞，故戰後此等地區之教育，推行大感困難，據估計，一九四六年度中國各級學校之入學人數大增，但學校之設備，仍極度不敷應用，而尤以中大學爲然。抑有進者，中國一般敎育水準，由於戰爭關係而形低落。（四）衣着，戰爭結束時，中國棉花之生產量减至戰前生產量三分之一，同時由於其遲慢復與之敵，一九四六年度之　　，仍未及戰前產量之百分三十八，比即表明中國過去八年來所感受之衣着缺乏，「在未來之長期間，似不能有所補救」。</p>
<p>糧食進口將繼續　機器損失十之九</p>
<p>（五）糧食及農業，去年所作之調查，表明中國各地區均有不同程度之災荒情况，據估計，廣西災荒及瘟疫地區，有居民的六百萬人，湖南災瘟區約一千萬人，雖則預測豐收，當可减輕若干災荒，但在未來長時期內，尋覓及價購大量糧食進口之事，仍將繼續，而此糧荒問題，，迅速解決之唯一方法，則厥爲農業生產之擴展也。在聯總及行總之協助推行下，對於被水淹沒及荒廢之農田之重墾，以及在建立漁業方面，曾獲有若十進展。（六）工礦業，由於戰爭，盟軍對淪陷區之轟炸，以及接收時之情況，據估計，中國所損失之工業機器，為其原有量十分之九，據聞唯一能維持戰前生產量百分之十五至二十者，則爲鋼鐵工業及煤電工業，然最後若干迹象，曾表示在煤礦方面曾有顯著之恢復。</p>
<p>交通重建感不足　鐵路材料最急需</p>
<p>（七）運輸與交通，戰爭會使中國之鐵道車輛遭受巨大損失，同時重建工作則極感不足，目前最急需者，則爲鐵路材料，以恢復杭州至衢州以及衡陽至桂林之鐵路交通也。據進一步之估計，即使在整個聯總之鐵道計劃完成後，仍將繼續支持中國之各種善後需要，二年內之對華鐵道運輸進口，據估計逾四萬美元，中國在戰時除損失漁船三萬噸外，其他船隻，總噸位之二分之一以上，亦遭損失，預料美國之剩餘船隻一百六十艘，共八十萬噸，不久即將移交中國，最後中國之航運噸位，可達一百五十萬噸，此數已暫時可足供國內航行之用，然欲恢復中國商務之航運總需要，則將需三億美元。兩年公路復興計劃，約需一億餘美元，電訊及空運之需要則達五千萬美元。</p>
<p>進出口差四倍餘　公務員收入低落</p>
<p>關於對外貿易之償付事宜，中國之進口率，似爲出口率之四倍餘，最近所獲一九四五年最初十一個月內之進出口數字，可表示進口較出口的多四億五千萬美元，以官價外滙計，聯總之進口不計在內，該項進口，又可使此項數字增加百分之二十，戰後中國對外貿易之恢復，因生產及運輸之不健全狀態，及隨通貨膨脹而來之出口貨價格過高，而至「令人失望」。關於財政通貨膨脹之嚴重結果，即爲公務員收入之低落，中國正面臨使共國際收支相當平衡之一大問題，然糧食，資源，在國外之財產，及敵產等仍可用作緩和之用，其基本問題，即爲國家預算之不平衡。</p>

<h3>司法部令各地高院　加速審判漢奸案件</h3>

<h3>政治重於經濟</h3>
<p>由黃金風潮引起的經濟危機，茲已由國防最高委員會通過經濟緊急措施方案，政府將以大刀闊斧推行十項緊急措施。旣有這樣的精神和決心來處理當前的經濟危難，祗要能够澈底認眞執行，則當前經濟困難之克服，遲早該是沒有問題的。對於這一決策的採行，全國人民在戰後生治未能安定之會，自莫不寄予深切的期望。他們感到生活的困難，主要是由物價的不斷波動：在現階段的我國局勢下，他們縱不存物價下降的奢望，郤總希望一般物價能够穩定下來，使他們能够稍資喘息。本來物價的波動，及由物價的波動而引起的經濟危機，是一種經濟上的現象；而經濟現象之所以變動，這其間原受着經濟法則的支配。明瞭這些經濟法則而善加運用，未始不能克服這些經濟上的危難，導使國民經濟入於當軌。可是在我國，當前的經濟危難，導因於經濟關係者，似不若導因於政治關係者之甚。造成此次經濟上的危機者，其間原有政治因素在起著作用。所以在政府拿出了處理目前經濟危難的緊急措施辦法以後，我們郤要指出爲解除我們的經濟危難，政治的措施之重要性，亦不亞於經濟的措施。在某一意義下，政治的措施，或更甚於經濟：此卽所謂政治重於經濟。</p>
<p>就政治方面言，對於處理及解除當前的經濟危難，至少可分爲下列的三方面。</p>
<p>第一，當我們讀到　蔣主席在通過經濟緊念措施方案後所發表的談話裏，可以明悉，我國當前經濟的危難之所以造成，主要由於共黨的不顧民族利益，蓄意破壞。『由上所述，吾人必能深明當前之經濟困難，實由於八年來抗戰中所受之毀壞，以及一年來共黨擾亂國家破壞和平之所致。』可見我們賢明的主席對於造成當前經濟的困難之主因，已爲我們剖述無餘。對此一點，本報曾一再著論有所闡述。共黨稱兵作亂，破壞交通，致使我國民族經濟不能復蘇，復又掀風作浪，搗亂金融；凡此事實，應爲國人所共曉，共黨的作亂一日不止，民族經濟的危難一日不能解除；政府縱有經濟妙策，倘若共黨問題一日不解決，則是項妙策必將橫遭打擊。値戰亂之後，政府爲挽救民族經濟所最迫切應爲的措施，便在整理幣制；而幣制之所以未能整理，就因爲有共黨的破壞。爲解除我們的經濟危難，我們必首先對共黨問題有個解決。</p>
<p>第二，政府所定的十項緊急措施，法良意美，適爲一種合宜的措施。但是由於歷年來政治上的積弊，政府縱有法良意美的政策，在執行之際，往往盡失原意，弄得徒成畫餅。戰時的慘痛經騐，我們印象猶新。所以這次的緊急措施，萬不能再有失敗，只許成功。爲欲使這次的措施成功，我們必須加强行政上的效率；此在消極方面爲防制弊端的重演。我們的民族經濟已到了景後關頭，我們決不能使焦頭爛額的人民生活，再受打擊。所以對於這次的緊急措施，必須認眞執行，嚴加考核，其有營私舞弊者，必須處以應得之罪。這也是一個政治上的問題，是一個如何維持政治紀律，行政效率的問題。對於這一問題，不外勤加考核，賞罰嚴明，總要弄出一個是非來；萬不可不分皂白，致使一般忠貞自守的人爲之氣餒，甚至同流合汚。方案固然重要，但最重要的還是執行之際，是否盡符決定此一方案的本意。</p>
<p>第三，黃金市塲的在潮，如今雖已過去；但人民却已受了莫大的損害。此次風潮的起因，雖非單純；然主持財政金融的當局，旣未能防範於事先，復未能善爲應付於事發之後，失策失職之咎，實難辭卸。一昨留滬國大代表及參政員，上電主席，建議七項；其中就有這樣一點：「追究財政金融失策最高負責者之責任，整飭紀綱，挽回人心。」對於這一點，我們覺得也實在有考慮採納的必要。這又是一種政治上的舉措，但却關係此後我國民族經濟的前途。倘若對於財政金融失策最高負責者的責任不加追究：那政府又何以對遭受莫大損害的人民，所謂維持政治紀律，加强行政效率，又將從何樹立？</p>
<p>要之，目前我國的經濟危難，不單是一個經濟問題，同時又是政治問題。必從經濟政治雙方入手，然後始能有解決之望。政府所採行的十項緊急措施是合宜的措施；但我們希望同時也有政治上平行的措施，然後纔能解除目前的危局。</p>

<h3>太平洋戰略島嶼　美要求單獨託管　正式向安理會提協定草案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十七日電〕美國今日不顧英蘇兩國之勸吿，而要求聯合國安理曾將太平洋日委治島，歸美國代管。據昨夜美方消息透露，關於馬里安納羣島·馬紹爾羣島·及加羅林羣島諸戰略要地之託管協定草約，將於今日提交聯合國，要求其列入當前之議程內。惟據最可靠方面消息，如英蘇堅持此事須暫不討論，待簽訂日本和的後再行定奪，則美國亦可同意無限期討論。此間美官方己接奉訓令，將美國對各島嶼之單獨託管案，於今日安理會開會時，詳盡陳明</p>
<p>杜魯門總統曾於去年十一月公開說明美國要求單獨保衛太平洋各島嶼之條件，同時美國認為有關之各國政府，亦曾要求渠等發表美國此項建議之意見。英蘇雙方隨後皆通知美國務院謂，渠等認為此事須少待，直至對日和的商談以後再行討論。澳洲亦曾向美提出類似勸吿照會，指出澳洲在適當時期到來時，歡迎美國託管此項島嶼。英蘇照會之內容，美迄未加以公佈，但聞兩國無一國對美國之建議有何詳盡之反對提出。此問及華府官方坦白承認美陸海兩部，即使安理會對此一軍略地帶託管計劃反對，亦決意將其置於美國絕對控制之下。渠等表示，美國無意接受對此項建議主要原則之任何變更措施。</p>
<p>美方對此一問題，寗願直接送交安理會處理，而不願交付託管委會或聯合國大會處理，因美國所要求者，乃為一戰略地帶之託管，此一地帶在其一部分或全部不准外人進入，而又建築美國所需要之任何海陸空軍事基地及要塞也。根據聯合國憲章，戰略託管之建議，乃為安理會所直接管轄之下。</p>
<h3>英擬請聯合國　召開緊急會議　處理巴勒斯坦問題　安理會今日展開原子論戰</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十七日電〕英政府或將請求聯合國大會召集緊急會議，以處理巴勒斯坦問題，英官方已決定越過安理會而將此案直接提交聯合國大會或托管委員會。英工黨政府深信巴勒斯坦局勢之嚴重，實有請聯合國大會立即召集特別會議之必要，然各國能否同意，則尙未敢確言。按聯合國下屆常會定十月間在紐約舉行，大會常委均認為巴勒斯坦糾紛，未經大會受理前，恐不能向托管委會提出。托管委員會第一次定下月廿六日集會處理各委治地問題，巴勒斯坦亦為問題之一。</p>
<p>至於安理會則目前之議程已糾纏不淸，英國不再向其提呈另一糾纏之巴勒斯坦問題，當所樂聞，星期二安理會將重聞原子能管制問題之論戰。據云，屆時蘇代表將發表其原十管制之建議，而英國又將在星期三重提其久延不決之阿爾巴尼亞問題，安理會亦已準備受理，阿爾巴尼亞代表卡波己於星期六抵達此向，準備　覆英國指其曾在柯孚海峽敷雷危害四十四名英水手之控訴。</p>
<h3>消息報指責　美聯英反蘇</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十六日電〕一消息報」今日載稱：美共和黨已凖備與英國聯合，對蘇聯作「軍事攻擊」。該報指責美政論家杜爾斯於四外長會議前夕發表言論，因謀破壞美蘇談判。自共和黨去秋在國會中得佔多數後，「消息報」此次攻擊最為激烈。據稱，杜爾斯與共和黨其他領袖已從事破壞和平，其反蘇運動之原因，則以蘇聯近在聯合國會議中已「證明美國為一帝國主義的　武國家」。一月十七日杜氏在紐約發表演說，實際上係答覆邱吉爾關於英美合作之請求，其言無異曰，「邱吉爾君，我共和黨已準備加速與英國聯合，對條聯實行軍事進攻」。</p>
<h3>美國裁軍　三大前提</h3>
<p>尼米茲發表演說</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕美海軍軍令部長尼米茲今日在大學致訶稱，「先須實現三項前提，面後美口方能裁减其軍力，（一）為訂定完善之和約，俾消除將來戰爭之起因；（二）須有可靠保障，包括監察制度；（三）須有合理的保證聯合國機構，確係能够發揮力量之機構。全體國家倘能忠誠合作，則另一次大戰並非不可避免。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社馬德里十六日電〕弗朗哥頃向美國某記者發表談話稱：余若認為余之放棄政權，為拯救西班牙所必要時，則吾將樂於出此。若千方面曾指斥吾人，在戰時協助德國，實則吾人與德國之貿易，從未達戰前之數量。在珍珠港事變之前，英法兩國早已對軸心國宣戰，且日本終將參戰，亦為衆所週知之事實。但美國是時仍不斷以軍火及化學品輸往日本，直至珍珠港事變前數星期方始終止，此或即為美國欺敵之外交措施，但吾人何故不能採取同樣措施，實無理由可言，以言聯合國對於西班牙所採取之步驟，各國之業已召回其駐西大使者，亦應召回其駐在波蘭南斯拉夫乃蘇聯之大使云</p>
<h3>日衆院月杪解散　將於四月年五日重行選舉</h3>

<h3>下屆美總統竸選時　誰將出任候選人？</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓電〕美國自共和黨控制兩院以後，一般趨向，為阻止國際經濟主義之發展，集中注意力於國內勞資關係問題，國內市塲，稅率，退伍軍人福利，及農產價格等問題。如此項趨向繼續至一九四八年，則下屆美國總統之主要任務，當為：（一）對於保護關稅及剩餘農產等問題，則將採取美國國民利益與世界政治制度調和政策；（二）一方面平衡預算，他方面則更减低徵稅政策；（三）建立有組織勞工權利與資本家間之穩定情勢；（四）擴展農產價格之穩定及控制剩餘農產計劃（五）滿足退伍軍人所要求援助。由於共和黨重控制兩院，共和黨總統有獲選可能性大為增加，而受人注意。蓋此在歷史上，兩院中途改選，獲多數之政黨，而繼續能獲得政權者，頗不乏前例。</p>
<p>惟杜魯門總統，在民主黨中，仍保持其領袖地位，尤其在馬歇爾表示無其他政治野心以後。新國務卿之目的祇希望在內閣職內，獲有成功，即不願妨礙杜魯門之成為一九四八年之總統候選人。</p>
<p>至共和黨方面，則希望一九四八年能獲勝利，當前最關切之問題為：何人能獲選？</p>
<p>此一人選寗願其為有效率之立法家與行政家而不願其為改革家與理想家。就目前言之，紐約州長杜威參議員范登堡與塔虎特，為共和黨最孚衆望之人物。他如參議負布里克爾，前明尼蘇泰州長史泰遜，加州州長瓦倫，亦非無望之人。如明年共和黨全國候選人指名大會中發生政治僵局，則出諸人意料之外之人獲選為候選人，亦非不可能。馬歇爾旣不參加候選人競爭共和黨現已不再討論以軍人如麥克阿瑟等人為候選人，華盛頓方面盛傳紐約州長杜威，假定為最有希望之共和黨候選人。參議晨范登堡，雖孚衆望，然由於其為參院外交委員會主席，在政治地位上極屬重要，或將退居其次。參議員塔虎特亦由於其在共和黨控制下之參院佔重要地位之故，似亦對總統候選人不十分關心。參議員布里克爾對總統候選人，亦未採取積極能度。至史泰遜，在美國國內政治上，則仍有一謎。若干人認為史泰遜去年米競選參議員，為其失著。蓋一經當選，即將受人之注意也。然史氏現雖未担任公家職務對未來總統一職，却已躍躍欲試，在華府設立其辦事處。此事在美國史上，尙未有前例。瓦倫之當選為加州州長，獲得共和·民主兩黨之擁護，渠以有效之行政專家獲名，將為一九四八年之「黑馬」。</p>
<p>民主黨方面，有人推測現商務部長哈里曼可能為一九四八年之民主黨候選人。然衆料渠至今不過為副候選人。至於華萊士之地位將來究屬如何，仍為各方聚訟紛云之問題。顯然渠已不為民主黨重視，惟若干研究政治者，認為如國際或經濟形勢有大變動，或使渠有成為進步黨或第三黨總統候選人可能。惟此類候選人，獲得之票數或不多云。</p>
<p>美國新政系的分裂</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓電〕美國新政系之左翼及進步份子，由於羅斯福總統之死以及戰後共和黨大捷等連續之打擊，至少須四年之久，始能復原，甚至有謂尙須待至六年或八年以後，左翼及進步份子始能拾頭。而在此等份子之內部，又因親共與吾之問題，使力量一時不能集中。</p>
<p>其中之左派人物，以前商長華萊士為領導，前聯總署長賴迦第亞，前助理國務卿麥克利許，前國民政治行動會會長金鄧等，均為其主要人物。彼等主張對於蘇聯應採更合理而友好的政策。</p>
<p>更該派觀念不同之新政系人物，為　斯福夫人及其子，前物價管理局長漢特森，保德及鮑爾斯，前戰時情報局長台維斯等。彼等主張眞正的進步主義與親共產主義間應有明晰之分界棧，彼等對前國務卿貝爾納斯之對蘇政策亦殊贊成。</p>
<p>前述兩派新政系人物，已各有其組織產生，華萊土領導者名為「美國進步公民協會」，係聯合「美術科學職業獨立公民委員會」及「國民政治行動會」之力量而組成，主張擴大並繼續羅斯福之新政內政政策。在外交方面，主張反對法西斯主義及帝國主義，更要求積極改樂國務院目前之外交政策。與其相對之組織名「美國民主行動會」，由羅斯福夫人及若干前任政府要員，為對抗前兩被指為共產之組織而組成者。彼等主張擴大並繼續故羅斯福總統之內政政策，似贊成國務院之大部份外交政策。</p>
<p>美國工會左派份子支持前兩派者之人數，大約相等。新政系人物除因共產問題而分裂外，復因是否應組第三黨之問題而難以融洽。其中有主張支持兩大黨中之任何進步份子者，有主張繼續與民主黨保特連繫者，亦有主張逕行設立第三黨者，預料在數年以內，，前三種意見尙無從成立協議。</p>

<h3>市長昨召開各業領袖會談　王部長應邀出席表達政府意向　闡明經濟方案要旨　深盼人民合作共渡難關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中樞宣布經濟緊急措施方案後，吳市長特於昨晨九時召集本市工商業領袖在市府舉行會談，並邀請經濟部長王　五參加，至十一始時散。王氏對此次所訂經濟措施，曾作詳盡闡述：論及實施物價管制一點，認爲必須人民與政府有密切之合作，始能收效。關於此次方案中平衡預算一項，主要在緊縮非迫切需要之支出，及着重民營事業，政府己經營之國營事業，或正將由政府經營之國營事業，均可公開出售於民營，用意在導游資於正軌。</p>
<p>關於取締投機買賣，安定金融市塲一點：上海工商界有兩種矛盾，一方面係資金短絀，請求政府辦理工貸及商貸；一方面係遊資充斥，競相投機於黃金買賣。政府有鑒於國內工業成本高，工資高，國產品輸出不易，爲欲爭取國外市塲，始有照價補貼百分之百及微收進口附加稅百分之五十之舉，不料此項辦法實行後，外貨飛漲，國貨亦隨之上漲，遠超過百分之五十，其原因即由於人民未能與政府合作之故。此次決定取締黃金投機買賣，及禁止外幣流通，主要用意仍在穩定物價。又提高外匯，目的亦在鼓勵輸出，政府現準備以二萬萬美元作爲正常工業品輸入之用，惟政府此次將有限之外匯控制後，深望全國人民養成愛用國貨之習慣。</p>
<p>關於工資以一月份爲最高指數一點，深望勞工界體念政府之至意，刻苦自特。同時政府在顧念勞工生活之原則下，行將以食糧，布疋，燃料，實行普遍配給。至言管制物價，及供應民生日用必需品，政府根據「非常時期農礦工商管理條例」及「取締違反限價議價條例」，決定嚴格執行。同時亦望工商界領袖與政府合作，各本愛國熱忱，艱苦支撑，共渡難關。</p>
<p>繼由市商會理事長徐寄廎致詞，謂本人所欲言者，外匯黃金美鈔問題解決後，物價問題仍不能解決。同時希望政府，對澈查黃金美鈔投機事件，不致苛擾正當商人。</p>
<p>市長提出兩點意見</p>
<p>最後市長致詞：謂最近本市物價波動甚烈，誠如市商會徐理事長及駱理事上次在市府討論物價會所稱，各項物價雖直綫上漲，而貨物成交則甚少，可見物價波動，各業均蒙不利，本人願提出兩項意見，與諸位商討：（一）前數日本市黃金黑市漲至九百七十萬元，美鈔黑市至二萬一千元，現在黃金價格，中央銀行已有規定，美鈔價格政府亦規定爲國幣一萬二千元折合美鈔一元，黃金與美鈔，均見跌落，各項物價，即應比例跌價，絕不應再漲。（二）政府所定之法令極嚴，但本人過慮今後社會遊資重將轉人囤積貨物一途，深盼諸位轉告各業，切弗囤積居奇，尤以有關民生日用必需物品，如棉紗，棉布，食糧爲然。關於經濟措施，政府並不願用政治壓力，所望各業與政府合作，同心協助。勉渡難關。苟有任何困難，政府必負責設法予以解決。關於穩定物價與平抑物價之詳細辦法，請市商會明日召開全市各業同業公會詳細商討，王部長倘能參加，當屬更善，本人屆時定當參加。</p>

<h3>修汽車舞弊案初審　患通虛開發票　俱犯貪污罪嫌</h3>

<p>馮培芳稱·利潤特薄</p>
<p>第二被告馮培芳供稱：本人乃正當商人，從事汽車事業，已數十年，此次承接市府生意，乃欲建立信用，故所取利潤特別低。且修理市府汽車地點，皆在市府停車廣塲就地修理，修理究竣後亦必需由市府派員騐收，並無虎開發票串通舞弊情形，繼由兩被告辯護律師聲請交保，經庭上駁回，諭還押，俟改期再訊。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕前工部局華籍職員之退職金償還問題，雖經數度請願，然迄今仍未解決。昨日上午有前工部局警務處警員三百餘人，由代表沈耀庭，劉少卿，等八人，率領前往市府，再度向市長請願，提出二項要求：（一）請明示發還之日期，（二）請按照生活指數之倍數發給。常由吳市長接見，答以對上决所計算發還之數字，因爲數甚鉅，須待有關各國之同意，故日期難以確定。關於倍數問題，市長當代爲據理力爭。</p>
<p>據淸理委員會有關方面人士透露：關於退職金之償還倍數問題，市府方面已決定以一千倍賠還之。其償償還之年份，則決定算至二九四一年十二月卅一日爲止。外籍職員，一律以外幣償還，其詳細辦法，已呈請中央核示云。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）遺產贈與</p>
<p>徐禮東問茲有法律問題數則，請賜答；（一）生前贈與子女之產業，是否作爲遺產論？（二）該項產業受撥付時未隨即過戶，是否仍作遺產論？</p>
<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕生前撥付，乃贈與行爲，該撥付之產，已因贈與而移轉於受撥付人，不能以未經過戶，認為贈與無效。故（一）五年前已撥付之產，不應列入遺產範圍，（二）旣於生前撥付，並已移交管理，不能與未撥付同視。</p>
<p>（二）夫婦關係</p>
<p>陳瑛問（一）丈夫死後，夫妻關係是否存在？（二）夫妻之任何一方有意作難是否有罪？（三）夫妻之任何一方能否不徵求對方同意而解的？（四）離婚後嫁粧是吾歸女家收回，倘彼方不允，是否犯侵佔罪？</p>
<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕（一）夫妻間互負同居之義務，亦互有繼承遺產之權，丈夫死亡，妻之同居義務，固不復存在；而遺產之繼承，則且開始，要不能謂法律關係，均已消滅。（二）不作迅速答復，不能認爲有罪。（三）家屬與家分離，須經請求，若改嫁，則當然脫離關係。（四）嫁粧爲妻之特有財產，夫家　權留置，但若僅因反對脫離，阻止搬動，而無吞沒之意行，尚不能謂爲犯罪。</p>

<h3>英國文化委會駐華代表　羅士培敎授昨逝世　中英文協停止聚餐誌哀</h3>
<p>英國文化委員會駐華代表羅士培敎授，昨日（十七日）上午，忽於南京逝世。羅敎授生前積極推進中國教育，其在中國之華籍西籍友人爲數衆多，遽傳　耗，同深哀悼。羅士培敎授生於一八八〇年，曾就讀於葛洛斯格洛芙學校與牛津大學。於牛津攻讀現代史時，曾榮獲葛蘭德斯東紀念獎金。自一九一七年至一九四四年，羅敎授會於利物浦大學担任地理學敎授。</p>
<p>初次來華</p>
<p>羅敎授於一九一三年，持亞爾培康氏獎金週遊世界時，曾初次來華。此獎金，由法國著名銀行家亞爾培康氏所設立，目的在鼓勵大學靑年獲得有關外國文化之學職，以便促進國際間之源解。一九二一年秋季，羅敎授復以基督敎敎育委員會之委員身份，一一度來華，進行敎會大學與中學校間以及敎會學校與政府敎育制度間之調節工作。常時羅敎授與其他人員曾在前任燕大校長，即今美大使司徒雷登博士之領導下，旅行華北與華中各地。</p>
<p>再度出席</p>
<p>一九三一年秋，太平洋學會在上海與漢口開會，羅敎授再度出席爲英國組之代表，此外，渠又曾代表倫敦之大學中國委員會，在上海，南京與北平，舉行演講。羅敎授在英倫時，經常與留英學生保持密切之聯絡。自大學中國委員會成立後，渠即爲委員之一，且時常兼執行委員會之職務。</p>
<p>曾駐重慶</p>
<p>一九四五年五月，羅敎授偕夫人同來重慶，任英國文化委員會駐華代表之職。夫人亦爲該會演講歷史之一名委員，過去渠曾在利物浦大學歷史系任職多年。去年秋季，羅敎授夫婦，始來滬訪問，先後在上海若干學校及敎育機關，發表頗具學術價値之講演。羅敎授並在上海英國商會，上海英橋俱樂部，發表演說，以及在國際廣播電台播講一次。</p>
<p>在華活動</p>
<p>羅敎授始終爲中英兩國間文化交流之密切關係而在華活動，從而爲促進中英間友誼之英國文化委員會而努力，並無政治目的，抑或商業目標；更爲中英科學合作館之工作，取得密切聯繫。中英科學合作館，刻劃入英國文化委員會科學部內，總處設於南京。羅敎授對中國史地方面，著文甚夥，包括第十四版大英百科全書中之中國部分，並爲牛津小叢書撰一「中國」小册。羅敎授之逝世，實爲中國文化與敎育界方面失一良友，蓋渠曾以畢生精力，促進並鞏固中英友誼及兩國之瞭解。又：中英文化協會原定明日（十九日）聚餐，刻已予取銷，以誌哀悼。</p>

<h3>美敎育界積極推行　「進步敎育」</h3>
<p>— 晋</p>
<p>從實際生活中擷取活的敎材　不從死課本刻板的敎導學生</p>
<p>美國敎育界對於「進步敎育」的制度，推行頗力。這種制度是廢除學院派的死板敎育方法，而採納與實際生活相關的敎材。美國許多中學，都已普遍採用這種制度了。</p>
<p>美國哥倫比亞大學敎授凱爾派屈里克，在一九四六年五月號的「進步敎育」刋物上，曾對「進步敎育」與傳統敎育的不同之點，加以如下的說明：傳統的敎育方法，是刻板的僅將課本中死的智識來敎導學生，「進步敎育」則是從實際生活中，擷取活的敎材，學生不但能從中獲得新鮮豐富的智識，幷能培養多方面的才能。</p>
<p>曼恩（1796-1859）和狄威（1859-）兩人，對於美國敎育原理有極大的貢獻。曼恩是馬賽諸塞州敎育局局長，他曾改進該州學校設施，提高敎育標準，及改善敎師待遇等，其後他又担任安梯渥區專科大學校長，該校實行輪流讀書與工作的制度（兩個學生合做一樁工作，彼此輪流工作，以便兩人都有讀書的時間）。狄威是哥倫比亞大學的哲學敎授，他竭力提倡從經騐及現實中獲取敎材，他的許多關於敎育的著作，不論在美國或其他國家，都受到熟烈的歡迎，幷被選爲課本的敎材。</p>
<p>下面這些圖片，顯示美國若干公立學校推行「進步敎育」的情形：</p>
<p>〔圖一〕美國的「進步敎育」制度下的維斯康辛大學附設的「實例表明學校」裏，用有聲電影來敎導學生。</p>
<p>〔圖二〕喬治亞州的沙山小學是喬治亞大學附設的「敎育實騐室」，該校推行「進步敎育」制度，圖示一年級生用無綫電留聲機，收聽民謠。</p>

<h3>星期日甲組足球賽　東華會逢戰蘇聯　幼級盃星期四決奪冠軍</h3>
<p>足球委員會昨日發出第十九號通告云：除對各球隊違背運動道德之球員，予以警告處罰，已於日前公布各報外，本週秩序，亦經排定公佈，本週四下午三時，幼級盃決賽，靑白乙相逢鐵路於逸國。週末晨十時起，市長盃甲組及丙組決賽共五場，分別假逸園及中正公園球塲比賽。</p>
<p>幼級盃決賽，靑白乙對鐵路，靑白乙麾下擁有名將甚夥，如黃仕傑，黃振東，張鳳崗，經靈桂等實力甚强，而鐵路陣內，亦不乏奸手如陸慶祥，蕭子文，吳炳浩，瞿錫根，張其昌輩，戰鬥力頗强，一旦相逢，鹿死誰手，殊難逆料。</p>
<p>甲組東華逢蘇聯，雙方均已休息多時，在養精蓄銳之現狀下，屆時會師，必各出全力以赴，東華爲保持常勝軍榮譽，當以精銳登塲，蘇聯則企圖名位擢升，亦將以驍將應戰也。本週秩序錄下：</p>
<p>二月二十日（星期四）</p>
<p>靑白乙—鐵路（幼級盃決）　三時正　逸園</p>
<p>二月廿三日（星期日）</p>
<p>東華—蘇聯（甲組）　三時半　逸國</p>
<p>華光—捷馳（市長盃）　十時正　中一</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽精彩戰　春茂今晚遇仁餘　綠林對華陽女組青紫逢強華</h3>
<p>二屆籃球聯賽，今日五時半開始，在市體育館循例有甲女組三慕戰事，門票照舊，秩序及裁判錄下：</p>
<p>女青紫—强華（女組）五時半</p>
<p>裁判兪菊廬</p>
<p>綠林—華陽（甲二）六時半</p>
<p>裁判許蘭姆金伯陶</p>
<p>仁餘—春茂（甲一）七時半</p>
<p>裁判瞿鴻律楊烈誠</p>
<p>女組女青紫逢強華，此役無關大局，但以兩隊實力之均等，戰情乃趨緊張。緣女靑紫有王務釀等好手，乃新興之勁旅，而强華曹氏姊妹，更苦練不輟，球藝猛晋，屆時未卜勝利誰屬。</p>
<p>次幕甲二部綠林逢華陽，前者原抱奪標雄圖，惜上週冷門突出，敗於培爾，遭受打擊，惟麾下多年靑勇將，實力非可輕視，華陽多胖部舊部，沙塲久戰，經騐豐富，陣容與綠林可頡頏，且雙方均僅負一次，今日之遇，有關亞軍名位。</p>
<p>壓軸甲一部仁餘對春茂，爲精彩之戰，蓋春茂初組成軍，曾敗上屆盟主華聯，一時籃壇人士為之側目，惜最近二仗，敗於巨人及海陸靑，殊爲可惜，仁餘球藝，一日千里，合作功夫，高人一等，出師以來，戰勝恩卡斯而受挫於巨人，與春茂可謂旗鼓相當，一塲鏖戰，勢所不免。</p>
<h3>加拿大少女獲　世界溜冰錦標</h3>

<h3>籃球友誼戰</h3>
<p>體育館敗於體育堪</p>
<p>籃球友誼賽市體育塲與市體育館二隊，昨日下午二時會師於體育館，敎育局顧李兩局長及雙方領隊蔣湘靑及邵汝幹，俱親臨督戰，故賽來緊張非凡。裁判陳良　，第一節體育塲僅以十三比十二勝一分，第二節體育塲李文元大見活躍，體育館僅賴姚明華龔師尹得六分，故前半結束，體育塲以二十八比十八佔先。易籃後，競爭益烈，成拉銀局面，第三節四十一對卅，塲方仍領前。　節館方胡宗瀋姚明華李國元等，力圖挽回，無奈塲方不肯放鬆，迨終塲時，體育塲以五十五比卅八克體育館。</p>
<h3>鐵路處際小型球營業今逢材料處</h3>
<p>鐵路處際小型球賽，因速日天雨，球塲積水，未能成賽，茲以天時放晴，定今日下午一時起，繼續比賽，由營業處對抗材料處，前者除有名將韓龍海外，復得靑白健將高保正來歸，故實力倍增，後者人材平均，雙方實力相等，屆時必有精彩演出，比賽地點，在虬江路鐵路球塲。</p>
<h3>籃球聯賽形勢日緊　甲組女子組各隊近狀錄</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕第二屆籃球聯賽，比賽迄今，戰程已去大半，男子甲一二兩組，形勢日見緊張，女子組漸達決定階段，茲將各組形勢，分折如下：</p>
<h3>女子組錄隊稱雄　對雪白最後決賽</h3>
<p>錄隊之稱雄女子組，　聯寳座，已無問題，前晚又以五十四與十二之比克靑聯，游刅有餘，僅待與雪白最後一塲決戰，便可分曉。微聞靑聯雪白業訂攻守同盟之約，深欲情讓給雪白以機會，且看雙方補賽如何。據一般人說：綠隊陣容，過去恐較本屆堅强，然乎？吾乎？迄今雪白三戰全勝，觀其成績，似堪一爭榮銜，惟以綠隊劉珍寳黃明媛李蘊芝等有把握之投籃，將與雪白後衛，一較身手，屆時鬥爭之劇烈，常在意料中。他如力隊女靑等雖一再失利，究因年事尚幼，惟動作均已略具雛形，若假以時日，不難登堂人室，觀其每次之比賽精神，令人欽佩。</p>
<h3>京市體育會主辦　首屆室內籃球賽　十二日起在中大舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕南京市體育會主辦南京市室內籃球聯賽，於每星期六下午二時至九時，及星期日上午九時至下午九時，假中央大學體育館舉行。此次第一屆聯賽，定二十二日在中大體育館比賽，京市區內之各機關團體學校軍警所組織之籃球隊，已報名參加聯賽之數將近二十單位。球隊球藝及球員，分男子甲乙及女子三組，男子每隊以十人爲限，女子每隊十二人，男子採用一九四六至一九四七年之最新規則，女子則採用第六屆全運會規則，每次比賽，勝隊得兩分，負隊零分，各組獲分最多之一隊，即爲各該組冠軍，如遇一組中兩隊或兩隊以上獲分最多，而分數相等時，則另行訂期決賽，各組冠軍，由京市居育會贈給獎杯以資紀念。</p>
<h3>女運動員特寫　運動全材黃明媛</h3>
<p>綠隊的台柱，本市女籃排球一員健將，黃明媛小姐最近幾年來在上海運動塲上，是出盡了風頭。所以「女遝動員特寫」，黃明媛小姐確是最理想。或有人要疑問，我的回答是：她是各項運動中，件件皆能，而且多是有特殊的成績，綠隊連年得了多少冠軍錦標，黃小姐功居大半。</p>
<p>有野孩子的作風</p>
<p>她至少有點「野孩子」的作風，因此—在球塲裏，她獲得了「阿媛」的雅號，自然—不脫孩子氣的雅號，的確—她有時候會活潑得毫無遮飾，看球看得出神時，她會忘形的呌，跳，甚至莫名其妙的手舞足蹈起來。總之，她外面表演出來的，純粹是天眞的自然。至於她的體格，不能說胖，也不能說瘦，高度方面，在國人體格方面看，還可說得差不多，大致是五呎二吋的高度。腿部很發達，當然是運動的效果。性情方面，告訴你，在她外形看來，一定是極暴躁的，事實上恰巧相反，她在球事之外，終是那麽靜默寡言。</p>
<p>學校及運動生活</p>
<p>她是工女中出身，在初中時，她在該校已在運動中露頭角，什麼都來得，那時該校有張麗珠，張惠珠，楊斐璧等稱霸於時，她因爲年紀還小，一時　不上去，直到她到初中三年級，她被選入學校代表後，居然一鳴驚人，她的演出却並不在幾位老將之下，於是大家都刮目相看，再加上她有運動的天材，成績使一日千里，籃排球已是成爲要角，而她的徑賽五十米，百米，田賽跳遠，以及自由車賽，她都是名列前茅，稱絕一時，到高中三時，她轉學到民立女中，所以她該算是民立的高材生。</p>
<p>籃排球中是全材</p>
<p>旣是全材，我就來替她分析一下。籃球：她是一員前鋒良將，也是　分之　，她能搶刦，她懂球路，她能妙射，她更能作跟進，實實在在是標準前鋒。可說是完全男運動員的作風。排球方面：她是二排的好手，也是一隊中的獲分者，她的劈殺，較之男子，亦相差無幾，碰到她殺下去時，一般小姑娘們都會怕的，其力量可見。再說她的百米及跳遠成績，過去據說都是很優異的，這基於她有彈性和速度，不過幾年來，塲地關係，因此不能確定她的成績。她曾經說過，要是讓她練習起來，全運會中得分是有把握的。全遝在即，希望她能努力一下。</p>
<p>家庭裏她是小姐</p>
<p>阿媛到如今還是待字閨中，家庭境况相當可以，因此，—她在家處裏，就不需要那麽克勤克儉地勞作。她問來時便聽聽無綫電，看看雜誌。有時她興之所至，會獨自展開了　　，和着無綫電中高謌一番。據聽見過的朋友說，阿媛是具有很甜的喉音，對干音樂又是頗有硏究，稱得上余嗓子，這也是她家庭生活消遣中的一項。據說，她高興的時候，居然也上廚房間，穿上白號衣，燒幾樣她母親及自己喜歡吃的菜。除了家庭生活之外，她便完全在球塲上活躍了。（梅子）</p>
<h3>籃聯名位之爭　仁餘今晚應勝春茂</h3>
<p>過去，仁餘常是華南的手下敗將，今夕出戰華南化身的春茂，以兩隊目前狀况而論，仁餘應勝春茂。</p>
<p>華南有三個射手：何金貴，李瑞雄，劉福善，春茂祗保有福善一人，而仁餘射籃人材較爲平均。</p>
<p>仁餘必以兩人看牢福善，春茂便陷半身不遂狀態，仁餘可以　機爲所欲爲了。</p>
<p>但春茂的防守力也不容輕視，何涵夫，黃天烈，鄭家彪都有捉換不定的射中率，春茂可加意防衛，比數必不致相整過大，福善如何擺脫雙人的牢守，更是精彩所在，和得失的關鍵。</p>
<p>就後勁來說，仁餘較者茂更爲充沛，而今夕之戰，後勁也該是勝利的一個因素。（昌年）</p>

<h3>中央銀行奉令收兌金鈔　黃金官價四八〇萬　昨日收進美鈔較黃金為多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行外匯牌價昨起對美電匯率，已遵照規定，改爲每美元賣價一二〇〇〇元。依此推算，每美元買價一一九〇〇元。對英電匯率每英鎊賣價四八三六〇元，買價四七九六〇元。其他各國電匯率，均可依此推算。又昨晨十時，中央銀行對黃金牌價，亦己定爲每十兩大條一條之收兌價，爲四百八十萬元。昨日該項牌價公布後，持有美鈔之中外市民，曾持鈔前往該行求兌，情形尚稱踴躍。該行特由業務局外匯科，直接收兌。每元美鈔，須附扣百分之三運送費，故實際收兌價，爲一一六四〇元。聞全日收兌之數，在美金廿五萬元左右。黃金之收兌量尚不及美鈔之多，且大多係屬銀錢業中迫於頭寸之同業，乃以黃金求兌移抵云。</p>
<p>又訊，中央銀行於昨日十時公布收兌黃金美鈔似格，計（一）黃金：每條爲四百八十萬元，（二）美匯：進爲一萬一千一百九十元，賣出一萬二千元。（三）遠期外匯：第一月進爲一萬二千二百六十元，賣出一萬二千三百六十元；第二月進爲一萬二千六百二十元，賣出一萬二千七百二十元；第三月進爲一萬二千九百八十元，賣出爲一萬三千〇八十元。（四）英匯：進爲四萬七千九百六十元，賣出爲四萬八千三百六十元。（五）港幣：出為三千〇二十二元五角。（六）美鈔：進爲一萬一千六百四十元，賣出爲一萬二千元。</p>
<h3>金號銀樓全部停業　錢兌業亦停止金鈔外幣買賣</h3>
<p>自中央公佈經濟緊急措施方案後，本市金鈔市塲及銀樓業，昨即全部停業，記者特分訪錢兌業及銀樓業負責人，探詢各該業反響，據錢兌業公會理事長在雲程稱：錢兌業自於昨晨閱悉中央公佈之方案後，即遵令停止各項金鈔及外幣之　買，錢兌業對政府此項措置，絕對擁護，公會方面並已決定二項步驟，（一）靜候政府對錢兌業今後業務之範圍如何規定，以及如何推行之，（二）如三日後仍無辦法公佈，則錢兌業擬推派代表晋京，向財部請願，解決職工之生活問題。最後，在氏並表承，昨日本市所有錢兌業，半數以上仍照常開門營業，唯對金鈔或外幣之賣買，則停止交易。</p>
<p>叧據銀樓業公會整理委員會負責人姚聯芳談稱：銀樓業公會獲悉此項消息後，即召開臨時會員緊急會議，決定全市二百餘家銀樓業暫將全部停業，並於昨晨推派代表姚聯芳，姚桂卿，吳彭年，陳德彰，裘雲良等五人，於十時許往謁央行業務局局長林鳳苞，據林氏表示，對銀樓業今後之配金問題，須出央行貝總裁等商妥後，公佈詳細辦法，在此項辦法尚未公怖前，盼銀樓業力持　靜態度，靜候當局之處置。繼於十一時許轉訪社會局吳開先局長，吳局長去京未返，由社局經濟行政處處長顧炳元代見，對銀棋公會之暫時停業，表示同情，並囑於午後四時晋謁吳市長請示今後各項問題，銀樓業公會乃備貝書面報告，於四時正晋謁吳市長，唯吳市長以要公緊身，改的今晨九時接見，銀樓業本定昨晚召開會員大會，由王代表報告晋謁各方之經過及商討今後各項業務問題，旋因吳市長改今日接見而改期。</p>
<p>又訊：全市銀樓業之加入公會者共有一五八家，據多數會員表示，如央行仍照以前配金方式配售銀樓業，則銀樓不論央行以任何價格配售，決照常營業云。金業公會於昨日下午二時，召開臨時緊急會議，商討今後業務方針，查該會會員截至目前止，共有六十餘家。</p>
<h3>二千美元以下　輸入許可證</h3>
<p>指定銀行不得再發</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行業務局及外匯審核處，昨曾銜分發通函三份予各指定銀行。第二類第十三號通函略稱：茲爲邀奉政府命令，自一九四七年二月十七日起，附表一及附表三（甲）所列貨品，其C．I．F．價不超過美金二千元或相等之幣値者，各指定銀行對該項貨品之輸入許可申請，已不得再予核定。第八十一號通函則對前此所發第七十七，七十九，及八十號通函，有關政府津貼出口貿易之規定，聲膽即予註銷。第八十二號通函，係促各指定銀行注意修正中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法第十九條之規定，即：「各銀行應將所收之外匯存款，截至本修正辦法公布之前一日止，其各外幣存款總額，迅行報告中央銀行。嗣後並須於每月月終報告一次，至各戶結淸爲止」。着各指定銀行應即增照塡報云。</p>
<h3>出口津貼　進口附加　江海關奉令　公告廢止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕出口津貼進口附加制取消後，昨日江海開特揭示第一一六號公告，略稱：案查進口貨物，自本年二月六日起，應按海關估價，徵收從價百分之五十之附加費，經以第一一五號布告周知在案。茲奉總稅務司令曾奉政府令，該項附加費，自本日予以廢止等因，飭即遵照等因奉此，除遵辦外，合行布告周知此布。三十六年二月十七日，稅務司劉雨彝。</p>
<h3>中信局繼續　配售人造絲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代理出售政府物資財產委員曾，於昨日下午三時，舉行會議，出席王子健·楊津生等，會議至四時許散會。當決定繼續配售人造絲，按去年十二月份之配售額爲準，昨日先配絲織業五分之一，約五百餘箱。又本週四配織帶業五分之一，計三十七箱半。配售價格照舊。如一百廿號高山，價仍爲二百七十六萬元。</p>
<h3>原料若不配給　配油無法恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據榨油公會某負責人稱：食油中斷配售，實有萬不得已之原因在，各油廠不能在大量虧蝕中繼續維持配油，因豆油議價過低，而黃豆之價格則淺無限制，目前黃豆喊價，已高至七八萬元，如豆油價格仍規定十八萬元一担，則每担勢須虧蝕一萬元左右，且外埠油價，如崑山等地，已高至二十七八萬元，黃豆價格亦在七八萬元間，各油廠格於成本與高利貸關係，大都虧蝕不堪，此次當局雖允許配給平價黃豆，然配給日期與數量，尚未確定，如平價黃豆未能配下，則配售食油，一時亦不能恢復。</p>
<h3>第二類貨品　二月至四月進口限額　輸管會昨已公布　總計九九六七五〇〇〇美元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會昨日宣布修正進出口貿易暫行辦法內第二類貨品本年二至四月之限額，並發表談話如下：政府深信此次所訂各項貨品之限額，足以適應本國工業上之需要，同時引導國家之外匯資源，使入於最有利之途徑。例如石油產品一項，其限額均大於戰前輸入量。蓋目前煤斤來源困難，柴油爲工業及航運方面所必需，而汽油及煤油亦各有其迫切之需要。棉花限額係按紡織業之重要性，棉紗出口之可能性而定。同時，政府於管制貿易之外，正在竭力籌謀本年度國棉之增產，俾能减少外棉之消費。民食所需米，小麥，及小麥粉三項，其限額應可補助國內糧食之不足。捲菸業爲國家主要稅源之一，菸葉之許可輸入，與維持國家稅收關係綦大。大蔴及蔴袋之限額，則幾三倍於戰前之輸入。蓋因其用於包裝出口貨品，對於鼓勵輸出貿易，裨益殊鉅。至人造絲，金屬品，及木材之限額，則並不包括與日本易貨可得之數量在內。其他第二類貨品之限額，大多係按戰前三年平均輸入價値而定。對於國內生產之情况，及國貨代用之可能性，亦已加以考慮。吾人明知國外價格增漲，若干種貨品限額，頗有未能滿足國內一切需要者，但應鑒於國步維艱，外貨之使用必須力求撙節。深信全國人士亦必能在節省國家外匯方面，作共同之努力也。至第二類貨品本年二至四月限額數字，公布如左：</p>
<p>（單位美金千元或其等値外幣）</p>
<p>貨品名稱　二至四月限額</p>
<p>汽油柴油煤油　一二，〇七五</p>
<p>棉花　四〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>米小麥小麥粉　二〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>菸葉　八，〇〇〇</p>
<p>蔴及蔴袋　一，二五〇</p>
<p>煤及焦炭　五〇〇</p>
<p>金屬品　三，七五〇</p>
<p>化學品　二，〇〇〇</p>
<p>紙（包括紙漿）　三，四五〇</p>
<p>木柴　一，八三〇</p>
<p>羊毛及條絨綫　一，四〇〇</p>
<p>人造絲靛硫化元及染料　二，二七五</p>
<p>橡膠及製品　一，一〇〇</p>
<p>滑物油油脂蠟　一，一六〇</p>
<p>機器帶藥粉拷皮料　三四五</p>
<p>硫酸錏及其他肥料　（暫停）</p>
<p>人造絲（原料）　五六五</p>
<p>藥品　（暫停）</p>
<p>水泥　（暫停）</p>
<p>汽車　（暫停）</p>
<p>糖　（暫停）</p>
<p>總計　九九，六七五</p>
<h3>大戶欲擒故縱　統債先漲後跌</h3>
<p>公債昨大戶欲出先抬，是以漲後即回，統丙晨開即見爭買，六〇四室等有補，多頭乘機力抬，自七二〇〇元起，扳高至九千元外，始見高而止，紛加脫手。大戶若誠德及五〇四室等賣意頗殷，近午回跌至五五〇〇元內，而後始盤。結果較上週六計甲乙丁戊各跌六〇〇元至九〇〇元不等。統丙跌落一八〇〇元，成交的八百萬元。</p>
<h3>各帮到貨擁擠　米價繼續挫落　食油雜糧市價多趨下游</h3>
<p>昨日米糧到源登記，南市塲有一五六六·四八五石，北市塲有七八九六石，二市共到九千四百六十二石四斗八升半。各帮來貨擁擠，此係審議調整後，各路客商認爲有利可圖，紛紛自產區運申之故，惟適逢政府採取經濟緊急措施，禁止金鈔買賣，故多數米商，亦深具戒心。一般販戶認此價格依然相宜，脫意甚濃，而各米店則反裹足不前。在此供多求少情形下，市勢一蹶不振，各貨均跌進暫定限價內。的較上週末挫落七八千至萬元光景。後市脚地仍虛，塲內交易完全公開。若後到可繼，米市趨勢續跌有望。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>晨間因社局人員巡視甚密，粉商及掮客等均各避風頭，不做交易。迄近午始稍有市面，但因米價續跌，人心一致看小，進戶寥落，成交極少。僅中途做開利朗洋粉七萬二千元，後市缺乏受主，午收買戶祗吃七萬元。兵船粉五萬二千元有做開，後市亦帶軟，各牌粉的續跌三四千元。麩皮跌勢較緩，價微降五百餘元。小麥仍未聞成交。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>再告下挫，在各貨頻報低落聲中，市氣恍惚，執貨者售意殷切，故市上供源充沛，而本街銷化則頗狹隘。簍生油開盤即小萬元，臨收廿二萬元，尚無顧問者，比前市回跌二萬餘元，新舊桶生油亦隨之削落萬餘元。豆油形勢亦虛，跌萬三五千元。本廠淸油跟低二萬餘元，廿一萬六千元有做開。小車蔴油再挫三萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市價多趨下游。黃豆交易不多，僅本街授受而已。各貨修削一二千元，獨平湖豆到源特多，市氣急轉下落，猛挫四五千元。芝蔴本各均形束手，價挫萬餘元，赤豆平疲之格，紅糧軟弱，苞米回落千餘元，生仁退落萬元光景，豆餅客胃微細，供者衆多，下降二千元。獨蠶豆物稀爲貴，續見加砌五千元，菉豆南方有吸，市勢堅挺。</p>
<h3>游資趨向華股　市況盤旋上漲</h3>
<p>華股昨攤續盤高，金融帮及外商買胃殊健，永紗曾迫漲停，惟證劵帮之存多，見高出籠，漲後屢有回風，晨開即昂，開後仍有爭買，二二〇號四七號銀行帮即進，二一八號一九九號二二號九五號一七二號紛購，遞交永紗逐步上升至一七八〇元，始稍掙扎，七六號九五號二一八號九四號一〇五號二三二號二二四號一二五號等均再購買，華豐勤興中法（高價達六十元）次第漲停，遞永紗升至一九五〇元，現交達一九一五元漲停，一七八號一〇五號九七號一五一號二〇三號逢高脫手，降至一八七〇元，遞交美亞及內衣亦告漲停，四三號二一七號尚進，而有回升，一四號二八號三五號一八六號二一七號一〇二號一九八號三六號九一號咸有供舊，乃將遞永紗降至一八一〇元，一三三號一五八號二一八號逢低尚納，曾回升至一八五〇元外，十一時後漸形　落，三六號三五號九一號八四號一七一號一四五號再賣，見一七八〇元低價，二三〇號一八〇號四七號二〇七號雖進，九一號一四號二一八號一〇〇號二二四號一二號仍賣到一七六〇元，一七七號九五號二二四號八九號二二號一八八號逢低來進，再回升至一八二〇元，一九八號八五號九一號一四五號賣氣仍濃，低價仍站一七八〇元左右，二二四號買胃尚健，午刻又越出一八一〇元左右，收後稍低，結果較上週六計永紗微升，信和美亞勤興升半成，新光量福華豐各漲一成，遞交永紗新光華豐景福各漲一成左右，冷股國貨升半成，餘均漲起一成左右，午後一四號一三號二二四號二二三號二一一號均售，開後即步降至一七二二元，由九七號三一號二二〇號進好二十元，傳銀行界銀根奇緊，有將金價削低售予央行以担缺單之說，人心見怯，一四五號一九九號八四號八三號九四號二一一號二一三號七六號九一號奮售，乃跌至一七〇〇元，入後九七號一四五號二二四號一〇二號四七號一五六號曾進至一七七〇元，九一號一四五號一七八號一九八號一九七號一五二號尚具賣胃，再退至一七一〇元左右，一七一號九九號七六號二一一號九五號來進，美亞忽起漲風，且有貼價五十元以上者，而回升至一七九〇元，一四號一二號尚有供給，降至一七四五元，九五號二八號二一九號一四五號一五四號紛紛購買，臨收復告回好，結果較上週六計永紗信和升半成强，新光勤興升一成弱，華豐美亞景福各漲成半，遞交永紗信和升半成強，新光升一成弱，華豐景福美亞各漲一成半光景，冷股統益因除息而告平，內衣水泥永公各升一成半光景，餘升半成至一成不等，場外各股尚無特變。</p>
<h3>中信局長劉攻芸談　洋米運華實情</h3>
<p>三月份在百萬担以上</p>
<p>中央社記者，以大批洋米陸續來華，其實際情形，頗爲各方關切，爰叩詢負責購運之中央信託局局長劉攻芸氏，承接見告稱，華盛頓國際糧食緊急處理委負會，分配我國本年上半年得在各地購運洋米數量甚鉅，我政府三月份在暹羅可購二萬四千九百噸，在越南可購三萬五千零七十噸，在緬甸可購二萬三千六百噸，總計八萬三千五百七十噸，的合一百零五萬担，至四五六月分我政府購運洋米之數額，亦甚鉅大，尚未列計在內，中央信託局奉命儘量購運，業已分派畢囊理慶康，黃專員兆鳴，岳副主任揚烈等，馳赴曼谷，仰光，西貢等地，分別洽購，並請當地使領館中國銀行等有關方面協助，劉局長復稱，上海洋米，已有存底，加以上項洋米進口，本市民食，絕對不成問題云。</p>
<h3>呢絨內堅外秀</h3>
<p>昨呢絨趨勢，內堅而外秀。標準行情，轉瞬增加，一經售出往往難以補進。自外滙滙率改訂爲法幣一萬二千元合美金一元後，同業中人莫不以有限之手貨互相居奇，暫不開盤。掮客之轉手交易，因此亦愈見困難。除大衣呢類，冬貨外，其餘不論粗毛細毛織成之男女色大路西裝各貨，西服裏襯用品等，無不全部軋俏。</p>
<h3>紗綫價繼續傾瀉　紡建掛承購者寥寥</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益形不支，晨初特雙馬及四十二支雙綫一跌五十萬，後者成交六百五十萬，前者成交三百九十五萬元，普通念支跌勢稍緩，亦落一二十萬，因銀根突然抽緊，加以當局已派員至市塲監視，又傳警備部紗布調查組已開始查賬工作，致一般投機者極度恐慌，人心大軟，頗有疲莫能興之况。迄收市時，特雙馬復降至三百八十萬，尚乏買主，午後二時紡建掛牌代紡管會出售民營紗廠，各牌紗綫價與市塲相仿，然承購者殊爲寂寥。</p>
<h3>外股軟化</h3>
<p>外股昨亦初高後回，午後更爲軟化，怡紗自一六二〇〇元開始回跌，而以低價結束，結果較上週六計抬紗英聯各跌半成，餘者升降俱微。</p>
<h3>中興保險公司　昨日遷移新址</h3>
<p>保險業在過去以洋商勢力比較雄厚，利權外溢，識渚傷之。自抗戰軍興，形勢一轉。國人深感保險事業與工商關係之密切，紛紛集資自營。迄乎現在，業務與日俱進，中興產物保險公司尤其佼佼者。該公司董事長爲交通銀行副總經理湯筱齋，總經理爲南豐實業公司副總經理談峻聲，營業範圍除人壽險外，其他一切水火物產等險，無不承做。近以業務日繁，原設江蘇銀行二樓之寫字間，不敷應用，乃於昨日遷入寗波路三十三號二樓新址辦公。輪奐一新，賀客盈門，頗極車水馬龍之盛云。</p>
<h3>金鈔停止買賣後　一般商品跌多於漲　物價前途可望長期穩定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自國防最高委員會通過將黃金美鈔，按中央銀行掛牌價，由該行收兌後，昨日本市金鈔行市，全部停頓。各金號，錢兌莊，證券字號等，均遵令未做金鈔交易。其他一般商品行市，亦屬跌多於漲。</p>
<p>行莊頭寸比較緊俏</p>
<p>華股交易，曾一度高漲，惟旋即回平，交易不多。至於各出口物品如猪鬃腸衣等價格，均未開出，亦無成交。桐油·乾蛋白·冰蛋·等，曾開出價格，已較上週六價漲起一成至二成不等，惟亦無成交。蓋各方對新經濟措施，尚多抱觀望資態。惟市面頭寸，自上週六起，即告緊縮。各行莊大多只收不放。蓋以昨日中信局標售大批零星物資，及配售人造絲，紡建公司又代紡管會開售棉紗。本週四台糖公司仍將照舊售糖，故預料頭寸前途，將日趨緊俏。昨日各行莊以迫於頭寸，持金向央行求兌者，頗不乏人。蓋按新頒行之金融業務管制辦法，各行莊如因週轉不靈，經央行停止票據交換，應即勒令停業，吊銷執照。故各行莊無不力求謹愼，以防萬一。昨日票據交換所各行莊交換頭寸，雖不無較平日爲緊，惟尚無擱淺之事發生。</p>
<p>面面顧到相當主動</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟學家楊蔭溥氏應記者之請，發表其對經濟緊急措施方案之見解如下：（一）新辦法有兩大優點：一爲多方面的，並非如過去之「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚」，物價外匯工價等均面面顧到。二爲相當主動，較現實局勢走前一步，如匯率之調整，即屬此一端。故此方案爲目前比較理想之辦法，相信物價能長時期穩定。（二）過去之經騐爲外匯調整後，國內物價激漲，但今日之情形爲例外，因游資已爲黃金所凍結，市上之銀根奇緊，暗息奇高。永紗上午並未因漲價而停拍，更無力量擾亂市場矣。今後以黃金吸收通貨之政策停止後，代之者爲以國營工廠之股票出售，如紡建公司，固早已有經營兩年後售與民營之意，如此游資當亦有正當之出路。（三）工資之限制亦爲合理之措置，因工資成本之高，實爲我國工業之危機，今政府配給日用必需品，而同時限制工資之上漲，殊爲合理。惟最重要之一點，即執行時必需求其切實。</p>
<p>對出口業殊為有利</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪進出口協會邱良營氏，詢以經濟緊急措施方案對於我國出口貿易之影饗，承爲解答如下：（一）此項措施對於我國之出口業殊爲有利，因其能顧及各方面也。出口補貼辦法如實施，則出口品之成本將飛漲，而將政府之補助完全抵消無餘。目前之新辦法則於提高匯率之外，並嚴密管制國內之物價，如出口品成本不高，則海外之銷塲必可改善。（二）依照新匯價折算，我國主要之出口物品，例如桐油·猪鬃·等，過去因價高而無法成交者，今日均處於有利之地位。惟絲茶兩物，國際商塲上競爭甚烈，故展望並不良好。（三）關於出口物資由香港出口之情形，今後是否能消滅，現尚不能肯定，此須視外匯今後是否發生黑價以爲斷。過去之取道華南出口，運輸取道陸路，成本亦高。商人將考慮在本國海港出口，與在香港出口孰爲合算。（四）政府此次措施中，有限制工價之辦法，目的亦在减低成本，並减少通貨之發行，在國民言，則爲一種節的之行爲。主席在今日談話中，已請求工人發揮其愛國心及勤儉精神矣。</p>
<p>進口商業勢將萎縮</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口業公會負責人周經為氏，對經濟緊急措施方案與今後之出口業，作如下之看法：（一）新辦法實施後，如國內物價不漲，則因匯價之提高，對於我國之出口業有利。惟我國大部之出口業，均在政府掌握中，民營者僅爲一小部份，而在目前通貨膨脹之過程中，一般人重視保存物資，故雖有新訂匯率之刺激，未必願立即脫手。（二）以進口業而言，今後將超於萎縮，因六個月內外匯限額僅有二億美元，各業能配到之數額甚少，國內工業用之原料仰給外國者，在存貨用罄後，將深感無以爲繼之困難。（三）政府目前之政策，爲抽緊銀根，减少市塲上之購買力，以求不致因游資之波動而造成物價之波動，用意至美。惟當注意者爲人民購買力薄弱後，亦影響正當商品之消費，而致造成商業之蕭條。此則與政府提高稅收之計劃，頗有妨礙矣。</p>
<p>美貨價格約增一成</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府公佈「經濟緊急措施方案」後，禁止黃金美鈔買賣，美金牌價提高至一萬二千元，此間各百貨公司及美貨商塲之反響，尚稱平靜。因各貨價早已依照黑市美鈔價格調整，另一方面則由於商人對物價趨勢，尚在觀望之中。若干美貨價格，約增一成，克寗奶粉售二萬五千元一磅，花牌淡奶四千五百元，駱駝牌香烟三千五百元，固齡玉牙膏大號一萬五千元，旁氏冷霜一萬八千元，沙利文餅乾九千元一磅，阿華利巧格力糖一千五百元一塊。</p>

<h3>淮南煤礦後備軍　新莊子煤層的新業況</h3>
<p>— 蕪湖六日快訊　本報特派員康風</p>
<p>順着津浦鐵路走到蚌埠，再轉乘淮南鐵路的火車，到達了淮南路礦局所在地—九龍崗。</p>
<p>九龍崗是舜耕山下一個小村落。民國十九年淮南煤礦打井時，道兒只有六家居民，現在，十六年下來了，淮南礦略局在這兒鐵路與煤礦區城里建築了一座供員工居住的小天地。路礦方面比較有點地位的人，都住在這里面。一所寬大的精美招待所，也在這住宅區中。九龍崗這地方孤立在淮河流城的田野里，路礦方面的人都是由上海，南京，天津，北平，重慶，昆明等地方來的，有的甚至剛離開都市化頂峯的紐約不久，自然歡迎大城市里來的人談談天。去年八月間地質權威，對於淮南現有煤礦的看法另有城府的謝家榮氏從南京到臨此地，自然深受他們的歡迎。</p>
<p>謝家榮氏，本身原不過到這個目下供應津浦綫南段以及京滬錢交通，工業，電廠的用煤底地來觀光一下，並不打算有什麽貢獻，可是，這個九龍崗礦路局里埋藏有許多深遠人物，其中柴登榜工程師，原先就是隨謝家榮氏在資源委員會探勘處工作的。二個人在九龍崗會見了，就不覺要談一談九龍崗這一帶的地質情形。</p>
<p>他們談到了淮南煤礦的壽命，牠的自然壽命與社會壽命，讀者當然可以想像到，他們兩位是專門發掘地殼秘密的，所以能準確的判定這個目前聚集了將近七萬人的礦路區域的繁榮期還有多久，同樣的，他們決定把他們心中的疑點來在實際探勘中求一判決，他們設想在淮河的南岸旣有九龍崗，大通，這一條灣鯽魚形的煤系地層，這一地層一定還有牠的來龍去脈，兩個人決定去查一下淮南煤糸地層，走到什麽地方去了！</p>
<p>淮南礦路局目前結構是一個混合經濟體，牠旣不是國有國營，也不是純粹私人資木，在上海的總公司有一批眼光遠大的指揮者，在礦路地區則有一班明快的執行幹部，像謝家榮這樣熱心的科學家旣願看看煤系在地下如何流走，礦路方面馬上供應着唯一的一輛漆成紅色的小吉普給他們使喚。</p>
<p>查勘淮南煤系</p>
<p>謝家榮與柴登榜二人，開始了淮南煤系去向的查勘。</p>
<p>第一天從九龍崗到大　，二個人在車中，不時下車硏看舜耕山石岩。</p>
<p>第二天由大通到鴨背埠，吉普過不去，前面是邱陵，棄車沿山路走，經過孫家崗，車羅山，李家凹。</p>
<p>山路表面是黃土，因此不敢判定煤系是否走道一條路，但這一帶正是淮南礦區的盆狀地形的里沿，九龍崗，大通這連綿十公里的煤系地層，位居淮南盆地的南部里沿；當然，若是其他三個方面里沿地質情形與九能崗以及大通相同，那煤層可以判定是在其中了！</p>
<p>二個人認爲沒有再走的必要，回到九龍崗礦區，謝家榮決定與柴登搒把這個在他編製的重要獲產分佈圖上，（申報六十年紀念中國分省圖中）不占地位的淮南煤層查出一個下文。</p>
<p>他回到南京，不久帶來一個測勘隊，這是資委會他的一套老人，八年來隨他敲遍了西南西北的塊有礦藏的山石，爬過高山與深谷！</p>
<p>這探勘隊與淮南礦局柴登榜所抽調的人會合着，在李家凹過去的蔡家崗，山王集一帶追查。到淮南盆地的爲淮河隔斷的邊岸，當然，河床會把煤系地區冲隔到淮河北岸去。謝柴探測隊爲此追蹤渡了淮河，徘徊在北岸錢家湖邊大丁家山與新莊子間的邱陵上　　鑽探煤層延長可以不必打得太深，打到第一層就止，探鑛層層延長的新鑽孔以新莊子第一鑽孔爲圓心，在其週圍東南四北五百公尺距離鑽孔，以新莊子地質地形判定這煤層延長走向大致由西北向東南，故此擬定以新莊子爲中點，在其西北至東南的五千五百公尺長度內探鑽煤層延長，（淮南煤層延長的爲十公里，即一萬公尺），首先在新莊子前後各打一鑽，第四鑽擬在錢家湖北岸施鑽，這麽決定了之後謝家榮就會到南京去。</p>
<p>發現新奇煤層</p>
<p>記者在十一月訪問淮南路礦時，淮河邊的空氣已是冬季了，柴登榜氏在他的家中給我比較新莊子新煤礦與淮南煤系地質的異同，淮南煤系地層是八十餘度的傾斜，而新莊子的只有三十度傾斜，傾斜小的開採時成本小些，所以經濟價値新礦區要大。</p>
<p>關於新莊子新煤層的儲量，他很謹愼的告訴了我求儲量的一個公式，這公式是：</p>
<p>煤層厚×延長×深度×比重＝儲量。</p>
<p>隨後他假設新莊子煤層延長倘爲十公里（一萬公尺）（與淮南者同）深度普通煤礦爲六百公尺，比重爲一·二·煤層厚據已鑽子的新莊子四層煤厚爲六公尺，其數字公式應爲：</p>
<p>六×一〇〇〇〇×六〇〇×一·二＝四三·二〇〇·〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>四千三百二十萬噸烟煤，儲量這自然是一個頗爲不小的數目字，但這個數字在謝家榮氏的全國重要礦產分佈圖所列烟煤有一千九百萬萬噸儲量中儘占到五千分之一（謝氏那張圖上沒有淮南煤的地位）但儘管如此，這已知數的新礦源旣在交通通達處，又在一套完整的老礦手伺侯下，這新　開採是勢在必行的了。</p>
<p>柴登榜說在三十六年春，完成初步探明煤層厚度工作。</p>
<p>卅六年年底以前探明煤層延長</p>
<p>卅七年春計劃開採。</p>
<p>這就是今年八月以後淮南礦區所發生的新莊子探礦故事，全部探測隊住帳幕，在野地工作三十天，以後還要工作一個長期，這情形等於一支小隊伍在過作戰爭生活這一段生活正是未來新淮南礦苗生長的開始，除了這個新莊子新礦區，柴登　與謝家榮還在計劃到平義山（　遠與鳳台交界處，爲　南盆地正北面邊沿）去看地質，淮南臘路局因此與資委會定下了一年探測計劃，這自然要導引出新礦區：也許在三年以後，新礦區架設着吊井高架，伸着大烟囱濃濃的吐着黑烟，工人們又像今日在九龍崗與大通的礦井里上下那麽的　鬧，那個時候，這兩位到處運用地質學原理以及一己豐盛經騐的地質專家謝家榮柴登榜也許在東北或其他地區去冒風寒踏冰雪了，但在今日我記述淮南礦區故事時，不能不特別着重這二個人的功績！</p>
<p>記住：安徽鳳台縣新莊子，新煤礦，可能儲量四千萬噸以上，民國三十五年在中國　亂中，由二個地質專家在謝家榮柴登榜以及二人的探測隊在資委會與淮南礦路局支持下探明了！這是新礦區今後數十年生涯的開始，別忘了這二個科學家！</p>
<h3>謝柴探測隊　追渡淮河北岸　石灰岩是一根引針</h3>
<p>到了九月間，有一天，探測隊在新莊子浮土下找到蚄　蟲石灰岩。</p>
<p>蚄　蟲石灰岩等於一根引針，探測隊停下來研究了，在九龍崗與大通，煤層是在蚄　蟲石灰岩以北的浮土下覆蓋着。（舜耕山在九龍崗大通礦區之南）那麽在新莊子的東北浮土下，一定可以找到爲淮河河床所割裂了的淮南煤系地層的藏煤。</p>
<p>謝家榮帶探測隊來淮南礦區時，也帶來了資委會他所常用的利根式150至250型鑽機，他們覺得眼前已在淮河北岸找到淮南煤系地層了，但這煤系的煤層厚度是決定今後開採有無利益的重要條件，謝柴二人決定在新莊子以東二百公尺處用鑽機打第一鑽，以求探明煤層厚度，</p>
<p>九月三十日鑽機入土，預定鑽孔至一百五十公尺深處。整整一個月，利根式鑽機鑽到地下一百二十公尺深處時，鐵　中的磁石發電器損壞了，十月二十九日只好停頓。可是這已探明的一百二十公尺深的煤系地層藏煤的厚度記錄，以大大的喜悅報酬了探測隊及其主領人謝柴二氏。記錄是；</p>
<p>十九·四公尺至二十三公尺處見第一層煤，煤厚三公尺餘。</p>
<p>六十二·三公尺至六十三·二公尺處見第二層煤煤厚〇·六二公尺。</p>
<p>六十五·四二公尺至六十六·〇五公尺處見第三層煤煤厚〇·五二公尺。</p>
<p>六十七·二四公尺至七十八·四七公尺處見第四層煤煤厚一·八五公尺。</p>
<p>一百二十公尺深的鑽孔里出現了四層煤，其中第一層達一丈厚，第四層達五尺餘厚均在一人高度之上。這種豐盛的厚煤層決定了這個新煤藏的開採可以大爲有利，（經濟價値具備），一百二十公尺以下即使不再有厚煤層，這一條煤系地層也已經够値價了，但預定探鑽到一百五十公尺必需辦到。謝家榮就此回南京整理一下其他業務，叧派了人到上海購買新的磁石發電器，以備續探之用。</p>
<p>就在謝家榮回南京之前，他與柴登榜商定了今後第二步目標爲探鑽煤層延長。</p>
<h3>西沙羣島　建設跡象</h3>
<p>西沙羣島，位於南中國海北部，西北去海南島楡林港一百八十里，東北去廣州珠江口三百六十里，西距南托倫二百五十里，東距菲律賓馬尼刺五百四十里，形勢險要，爲我國通達南洋之門戶。</p>
<p>西沙羣島主權之屬我國，爲一毫無疑問之事實，見於歷代史書及志書。一八八七年中法界勘專條中，亦明白指出該羣島爲我國所有。目下我政府已由日軍手中收回該羣島，自當努力建設，並開發富源，以期　固南洋國防，促進國際航運。下圖四幀，足以顯示西沙羣島建設遺跡一斑。</p>

<h3>盟長坐牢監　樹倒猢猻散　王慧生組「黨」　黨派史上壽命最短　十個月夭亡</h3>
<p>— 昆明六日航訊　本報特派員徐繼濂</p>
<p>這也算是一個「黨派」－「中國民主自由大同盟」，它的崛起在昆明市，固然盛極一時，只是沒落的經過也是意外的快速。</p>
<p>說到「中國民主自由大同盟」的盛衰，也眞敎人興起人事滄桑之感，它正式成立於三十五年三月，然而到今年一月便宣佈壽終正寢，連頭帶尾還不上一年，在近代黨派歷史中，恐怕壽命要算是最短促的了。</p>
<p>提起盟長　此馬來頭大</p>
<p>俗語說：「蛇無頭不行」，我們要介紹「中國民主自由大同盟」，自然不能忽略他們的「盟長」，也眞是「提起此馬來頭大」，王慧生三個字，一時紅透了半個山城，論軍職，他是黃埔第一期出身，論官階，他曾經是紅邊符號兩顆星，出生地在貴州一個小縣份，外貌一表堂堂，很有點書生氣概，可是滿臉風霜，一望而知他是被頻年奔波的生活，折磨得有些蒼老了！</p>
<p>身爲一盟之長，當然有着他獨到的長處，一眼望去，他的玳　眼框後面，兩個眸子放射着光芒，精幹是不用說的，且長於交際，常常會把一個陌生人混得跟多年的老朋友一樣熟。嗓子永遠是那麽響亮，衷氣足，談鋒健，性子非常急躁，北伐時，他當過連營長，帶着一枝雄兵，馳駛於閩粤之間。</p>
<p>王慧生也眞是「不堪回首話當年」，近幾年來他確實是鬱鬱不得「志」，手底下沒有兵，掌握中沒有權，每况愈下，因之「窮則變，變則通」，在無路可走的當兒，妙想天開，王慧生便組織了「中國民主自由大同盟」。</p>
<p>袍哥袍弟　望風而來歸</p>
<p>盟部設在昆明市總工會內，一時袍哥袍弟望風來歸，勢聲是够浩大的。盟下設部設廳，委任狀，滿天飛，部長廳長股長之類的人物多如「過江之鯽」，而一些失職的軍人以及閒散的　流，也都願意有這樣一塊安身之地。招牌是可以唬得住人的。</p>
<p>總部的怖置並不考究，正中堂高懸着某將軍親筆題贈的「民主自由」四個大字，這筆跡在當時也可以算得是一張靈符，許多人都把這地方看作為一個「神秘之谷」。</p>
<p>跟着他們選出了常務理事和監事，而且正式宣誓就職，聲言西康四川等省都要設立分部，宣傳盟員已達二十餘萬人，他們的「盟網」是「爲國爲民」，盟旗很別緻，三角形，杏黃色，上面還塗繪着一個金黃色的太陽徽，這鮮明的標幟在一次　雪國恥宣傳週裏出現過，那一次，他們一列蜿蜒的隊伍，穿過昆明全城作過一次空前的大游行。</p>
<p>經濟問題　盟長找出路</p>
<p>一個沒有經濟基礎的國體，要想另起爐灶，打開門路，那眞是談何容易的事？因此，王慧生很抓不開，他雖然到戲拉關係，找門道，但終究杯水車薪，濟得了啥事？</p>
<p>記得有一次，他跑去　警總備司令關麟徴，開門見山，拉開嗓子便說，「老關！拿點錢出來花花」！關總司令沒法不應付，終於掏了腰包，多少給了一個數目，可是砂石焉能塡滿得江海？自然，王大哥必須要另找路子才行！</p>
<p>有人開始懷疑他們的行徑了，然而王慧生早已脫離了黃埔的系統，加上和國民黨的歷史又沒有什麽多大的關係，因之局外人只得靜觀其究竟。</p>
<p>滿載槍彈　直奔昭通去</p>
<p>三十五年九月，盟長王懇生面臨他們經濟的危機，於是他也無暇顧及許多弟兄，親自駕着一輛G．M．C．子輪大卡車，上面滿載搶彈兵士，打着「民主自由大同盟」的番號，插着三角杏黃旗，浩浩蕩蕩直向昭通（滇東大縣，前省主席龍雲故里）駛去，不說別人，便是沿路的檢查人員也摸不着邊際。</p>
<p>用　東路上風塵滾滾，通行無阻，到了昭通城邊，入境停車檢查，王　生取出了警備總部的讓照，自稱「民主自由大同盟」　長，來勢洶洶，誰也奈何他不得！</p>
<p>最後命運　王慧生被捕</p>
<p>當天晚上，昭通城內屬上出現了一個新機關，門口衛兵林立，荷槍實彈，形相頗爲威武，而且昭通街上滿是配備齊全的武裝兵士。這一來，當地專員公署不能不動動腦筋了，也該王　生倒霉，同時昭通保安總隊恰恰接獲了昆明方面警備總部扣押王慧生的電報。於是經過了一番妥善的佈置，由電燈廠首先實施警報，這一來，王慧生到庭沒有料得着，只好束手被捕。</p>
<p>跟着王慧生被押回了昆明，「樹倒　　散，」不待一紙正式解散令下，「民主自由大同盟」已經土崩瓦解，「盟員」們紛紛改作他計，另謀出路，警備總部會同市府警局各機關查封會址，抄出印件文件。</p>
<p>經過保安司令部數度偵訊，王慧生以營私植黨，圖謀不戰的罪名，被判處徒刑十年，送進了雲南第一監獄，一人別室一間，倒也顯得非常安逸。</p>
<p>據說王慧生去昭通的動機，純粹是商業上的性質，並無其他政治目的，不想一去便成階下囚，怪不得王慧生曾對記者說：「不要以成敗論英雄，這是我命該如此！」口氣倒也爽直，很有點氣魄。再說入盟約哥弟中，想藉此正派作一番政治活動的也大有人在，然而惜乎領導者不得其人，再加上舉棋無定，浮燥乘張，以致事敗名裂，落得如此一個凄凉的下塲！</p>
<h3>世界婚姻市塲新景　結婚難離婚多　訂婚亦鮮見</h3>
<p>— 柏林三日航訊　本報特約記者宏負</p>
<p>回憶九十年前我國同治初元，洪楊戰後逃難歸來之民衆，飽衣暖食，生活低廉，猶安享二三十年承平之福，今則不然。新時代戰爭而後，食荒錢荒，甚至引起結婚市塲停頓之恐慌，絕非我前代祖先夢想所及。</p>
<p>巴西前任總統　為女公子擇婿</p>
<p>西方女性向苦「結婚難』，美國爲婦女之天堂，然大城市生活，不若農村之恬定，大多數女子之靑春，其智且美者，乃如中國歌壇劇院之明星，似水流光，任其消逝，下於此者更不堪言。南美文化，不逮北美之高，而結婚之難，却大相似。昔予旅南美，親見已故巴西前任總統之四位女公子，莫不坐擁珍寳園莊，富有大宗資產，聲光赫奕，舉止端莊，志在擇婿，惜尚無人問津，外交界播爲美談。迨抵東歐，瘡痍未復，自奧匈以逮巴爾幹半島各國，因受第一屆歐戰影響，女性多於男性，男子貪戀一時之娛，面逃避正式夫婦間之義務。女性有所追求，或者物質與精神，已饜對方之欲望，女性以絕大代價所換得之慰安，係至「訂婚」之階段爲止。</p>
<p>今日德國婦女　益感過剩之苦</p>
<p>西方女性之習慣，今每以接受異性求婚，爲一生至難得之「榮譽」。德爲好戰之邦，男性大抵死於戰，女性至今，益苦過剩。柏林爲德國首都，據一九四六年之調查統計，二十歲以上三十歲以下正待婚嫁之女靑年，有十九萬二千人，面年相若之青年男子，不過七萬一千。女國民之多，幾乎三倍於男子。其甚可異者，離婚之事尚加多，而訂婚者竟屬不可得見，是以女性接受異性求婚之「譽榮」，在彼德京，已成「夢想」。</p>
<p>非法的私生子　數量不斷激增</p>
<p>德國非法之私生兒，暗地激增，此以女子之需求，其第一件，固在得到如意郞君，而第二件，仍在得子於今不能「得夫」，則退一步而求「得子」。德國新女性之家庭生活，不復有並棲之男子，而男性在德國之地位，頗似舊時代之中國太本，僅憑以「製造兒童」。德國男女兩性之關係，却等於舊時代中國納妾之風，暗中造成「普媾Goly-gamy」式之一夫多妻制。此外職業競爭，多數之位置，旣爲婦女所有，不肯讓給男子，彼此相衝突，均足貽人羣社會之憂，此見好戰之害，至大且深。我國提倡女權維護公衆福利之代表人物，苟能退一步如瑞典瑞士之力保本國中立致和平，進一步如英國人篤好和平不好戰，一切佳望，無不可得最後之成功，此爲根本之謀，非頭痛治頭脚痛治脚者之徒講末節也。</p>
<h3>猪頭稅變質　竟成人頭稅</h3>
<p>— 六日南昌航訊　本報南昌記者劉藻</p>
<p>本省財政改制後，縣級財政有田賦與營業稅，各百分之五十，屠宰稅，營業牌照稅，使用牌招稅，房捐，筵席娛樂捐，契稅，還產稅。土地增値稅的全部，與公產整理所得經若各種稅捐整理就緒，點滴歸公，縣政府與所屬各機關的經費，不應該有什麽大的困難。但是，現在縣政府經費的窮困，已是到了山窮水盡的地步，星子縣長赴任，沒米舉炊，接任後的第一件大事，借了三十斤米開伙食。德安縣長到差，縣金庫分文無存，顆粒沒有。有許多縣，是金庫沒錢，會計無賬。</p>
<p>目前縣級財政完全靠屠宰稅，他們吃的是屠稅，穿的是屠稅，用的還是屠稅。國民小學的敎員，一方面敎書，一方面還要自己去收屠稅。我遇到許多縣級公敎人負，他們可以隨時在自己的腰袋裏，掏出一大把屠稅票，原因是不容易收到，祗好把它當着法幣看，安愼保存。現在的屠稅，照省府的規定，按價征收百分之五，每猪重量，在十一月份以前，規定爲一百五十斤，現在已經「肥壯到二百斤，屠稅的征收辦法，却花樣百出，各有千秋。</p>
<p>屠宰稅征收的辦法，除了由縣政府的保警隊警察局和鄉鎭公所的武裝兵警，挨戶坐收外，稅額的分配與征收的方面。</p>
<p>（一）由縣政府直接按鄕攤派。</p>
<p>（二）由縣政府採取「明委暗巴」的委辦。</p>
<p>（三）由鄉鎭公所經辦，解交縣政府統收統支。</p>
<p>（四）由鄉鎭公所經辦，以依鄉鎭經費，旣不報縣，亦不向縣政府請領經費。</p>
<p>（五）由鄉民代表承辦。</p>
<p>這些五花八門征收辦法下的江西屠宰稅，攤到老百姓頭上，又是怎樣呢？按頭征稅的良法善政，却變成爲「人頭稅一，而實際完稅的是養猪的窮苦老百姓，設案賣肉的屠商；和吃猪肉的人們，倒不負完稅的義務。並且有時一頭猪，須要負担二重稅，（甲鄉的猪，已是完了活猪稅，假如賣到乙鄉去屠宰，又須完」筆出境屠宰稅）。這些攤派的方法，是這樣；</p>
<p>（一）安義縣每月屠宰稅的配額，現在是九七五〇頭，（以前是七二〇〇頭），各鄉公所係按各該鄉人口爲比例，分配各保。查該縣現有人口計六六六八五口，一一二五三戶，每月屠稅的攤派幾每戶一頭，每頭按省府規定，猪重二百斤每斤市價以一千元計算，的征稅一萬元。</p>
<p>（二）安　縣的母猪，子猪，養猪，均須按月完稅，每頭每月的納稅一千五百元。</p>
<p>（三）奉新的屠宰稅是由縣政府飭令各鄉征解，統　支配，這算是比較合法的辦法。</p>
<p>（四）永修縣的屠宰稅，亦是按鄉攤派，艾城鎭（即城區）加了五倍征收，各鄉照縣配額加倍，保又照着鄉的配額加借，經辦的鄉保人員，加倍征收後，又來個新的花樣，說是「征額不足」，還要征收母猪稅，子猪稅，和沒有養猪的處罰金，活猪的稅率，是以猪的體重爲標準，由征辦人估計重量，完以每斤五元到十元的屠宰稅。</p>
<p>（五）德安縣的屠宰稅，是一方面攤派，一方面征收，活猪的稅率，已經漲到每一百元。</p>
<p>（六）星子縣的屠宰稅，不但是猪頭稅，並且是「人頭稅」，不論養猪與吾，屠稅一律攤抖征收。</p>
<p>（七）九江有一個鄉公所，每月經費預算是廿一萬，每月配給的屠宰稅是四十五頭，以二百斤的猪重計算，屠稅的征收是四十五萬，這籬稅攻旣不解縣，縣政府亦不催收。</p>
<p>假若從江西全省屠稅實收的統計數字看，不明眞象的人們，一定會懷疑到江西老俵，是吃猪肉最多的一省，同時却又是面有菜色，營養不足的一省！</p>

<p>編輯先生：本市所行駛之紅色廿二路公共汽車，市民稱便，且賣票員賣票認眞，絕不揩油，甚爲可嘉。惟該路公共汽車尚有一劣點，即賣票員不論在乘客稀少或較擠之情形下，在乘客未完全上車前即按鈴開車，致使甚多之乘客在車已行動時攀登，其時車門未閉，乘客時有跌落之危險，尤在婦孺爲甚。例如上月廿日在鄭家木橋即有一乘客自車上跌下，幸未致命。以往滬上各報對此事時有報道，但未引起公用局及公司當局之注意改良。故懇貴報一角批露，以促當局加以糾正。（沈思康）</p>
<p>上海站開出之54·52·23次各列車，當停在站上，車內燈光可以說全沒有的旅客均須於黑暗中摸索，這時正扒掱大施其技的好機會，我每次出門每次聽到人家遺失東西，尤其南京開來的51次車，及杭州開來的62次車，在中途時天色已黑，而車中的燈終是沒有人開亮，每到一個沒電燈的小站上下的旅客在暗中擠軋，扒掱便大肆活動，連日報上所登「四大名山」等竊案，可見車上竊風之猖獗，請路局當事，對車廂燈光，加以整頓，亦防止扒掱之良法也。（王得仁）</p>
<h3>廣西的吐納口　梧州</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者樑小中　梧州四日航訊</p>
<p>春序初臨，椒花輕頌，屠蘇低醉時節，一個偶然的機會，去來西江，飄然又行抵這廣西的門戶。</p>
<p>從桂林到梧州，由桂北而桂東，是一段漫長的路程。記者坐過通車剛五天的桂柳段火車，舒適寗靜，比諸粤漢路的喧囂雜擾，眞是不可同日而語。再從柳州坐汽車，挨盡了公路上「騰雲駕霧的苦况，返達翼王故里，然後再讓十八世紀的大木船拖到梧州。</p>
<p>十三年的睽別，梧州依舊景况依稀，白雪山儲　着不盡的江流，暮暮朝朝，不知送盡多少來去行客。踏上長堤，舉目四望，又是一片敗　　垣，再仔細看，眞是「有室皆破，無屋不殘」。廣西四大城市，個個如此，感慨得多少？</p>
<p>一步一菜館　五步一茶室</p>
<p>然而梧州畢竟是廣西的吐納口，貨物千萬，滾進推出，何可勝算，據說每日出入貨値，總有九個數目字。江面上來的是船，去的也是船，熙熙攘攘，簡直難以數計。由於商業的繁盛，於是行莊林立，酒食處處，人道食在廣州，以梧州的人數作比例，我敢担保廣州的酒食館比梧州有不及而難過之。鼓腹大賈，有的是錢，有的是金條，然處容身，自然恣意歡樂，於是乎梧州走了衣食運，一步一菜館，五步一荼室，河堤路一直經大南路而至南環路，無不如是，夜夜元宵，熱鬧景况，比之桂林的店舖八點鐘便打烊的凄凉，難以數說。一座破樓上面生滿野草，野草底下便是荼館，何處有蒼梧如此風味。</p>
<p>貨價步步高　冒險家歡笑</p>
<p>交通便利是促成梧州熱鬧的主因，從廣州上溯，兩日可達，貨物直通貴縣南寗，行銷全省，不外是三五日的時光。進口貨十成八九脫不離「Made　in　Ｕ.S．A．」的招牌，出口貨則以山貨，牲畜，茴油等為大宗。其中關關卡卡，遂至貨價步步高昇，一枝牙膏在梧州賣七百元，到柳州便一千元。到桂林便一千二百元。雖然這一個大門曾經斷了門框，榻了檻架，然而門內外却彷彿堆滿了耀眼的金銀，引起冒險家的興趣，忙着進，搶着出，好不起勁！</p>
<p>人多街道窄　汽車不入市</p>
<p>梧州的街道，依山臨水，窄隘不堪，馬路比諸南京的人行道還要小。人旣多，路又窄，擠得密密實實，極像漢口的花樓街。幸而爲了兩水之隔，汽車過不了江，只能够在對而河戎玗停下，不能入市。（梧州市上，從來沒有一架汽車，連人力車都沒有。）否則眞不知如何打算！</p>
<p>文化太荒凉　雞肋充飢腸</p>
<p>生意塲談的是生意經，在梧州想買一太像樣的書，有時彷彿總有「升天入地，兩處茫茫」之嘆。書店未嘗沒有一兩處，賣的不是敎科書，便是十二月以前的雜誌。書攤子比對面河的廢機塲還荒凉。記者行遍桂省東西南北，處處境况，莫不如是，不禁爲廣西的文化嘆一口氣！此地報紙，僅有梧州日報一家，編排呆滯，內容有如雞肋。更因市民除了喜歡廣州報紙的甚麼「憐香記」「記取眼前人」「篇篇怪」之外，甚麼都不懂，因而銷數亦頗惡劣。</p>
<p>來也匆匆，去也匆匆，三日的寄寓，不知道是梧州討厭我，還是我討厭梧州，簡直不願意再有一刻的停留，下筆疾書的當兒，左房間的客人正與私娼破口大笑，右房間的客人高談着「運鹽到韶關賺錢」。對面房間的客人拉着盲歌女高唱「情惆悵，意凄凉……」的廣東調，似乎一切都在造反。無數的蛆蟲們在樂土中現了原形。</p>

<h3>赴會以前</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>石科長一個人坐在書室裏的寫出桌旁，一手舉着一枝七柴三羊毫，一手挾着一枝香烟，在寫他的演講稿：</p>
<p>「現在已經到了原子時代，一切都要機械化，可是我們的交通工具，還在需用人力車，道不特是趕不上時代，並且簡直是違反人道！人力車夫……」</p>
<p>他寫到這兒，預備把人力車天的痛苦，儘量述說）番，可是平時誰注意到他們的痛苦呢？他不得不把筆擱在筆架上，香烟黏在嘴唇上，袖着手，兩眼注視着面前的綠罩子的檯燈，極力在思索着。</p>
<p>香烟頭上的烟灰已積了一寸，可是還沒有思索什出麽來他把香烟取下，彈了一彈烟灰，接着伸出一個給香烟燻得焦黃的手指，撳一下呌人鈴：</p>
<p>「叮……」</p>
<p>跑進來一個胖胖的女傭：</p>
<p>「科長，什麽事？」</p>
<p>「你去把阿喜找來！」</p>
<p>「是！」女傭退去了。</p>
<p>按着走進來的是包車夫阿喜。他穿了一件破棉袍，腰間束了一根靑布帶，衣服下擺也被束在裏面，衣領散開，一頂破呢帽歪戴在額角上。他的個子相常的高，背有一點駝，臉上已有很多皺紋，望見他，總以爲是二三十歲的人了，可是實際上他只有十七歲。恐怕人家嫌他過於年輕，所以他現在的年齡，多報了三歲。</p>
<p>「我有幾個問題要問你！」石科長把坐在屁股下的轉椅，輕輕地一轉，對着筆直地站着的阿喜說着。他的語氣很和婉，從來沒有這樣的和婉。</p>
<p>「是！是！」阿喜有點受寵若驚。</p>
<p>「你今年多大歲數了？」</p>
<p>「十……噢！二十！」</p>
<p>「哦，只有二十歲！」石科長對着那個相當蒼老的臉兒，表示驚訝：「你拉了幾年車子了！」　「已經拉了兩年，從前是拉的散車，當包車夫還是前兩個月的事！」</p>
<p>「公家一個月給你幾個錢？」</p>
<p>「六萬塊。」</p>
<p>「够嗎？」石科長吸口烟。</p>
<p>「那裏够呢？我一個月要穿掉一雙鞋子，化尖兩萬塊，餘下四萬塊，要養三個人，就是把錢磨碎了，還是不够的！」</p>
<p>「哦，你家裏有什麼人？」「有年老的媽媽，還有一個妹子！」</p>
<p>「你沒有父親嗎？」</p>
<p>「父親？」阿喜停了一下，哽咽地：「他也是拉車子的，可是有一天，跌傷了身子，吐了幾個月的血，他……就死了！」</p>
<p>「哦！」石科長仍把椅子轉回原位：「你去吧！」</p>
<p>阿喜莫明其妙地很出去。</p>
<p>石科長在阿喜嘴裏找到了材料，他把人力車夫的生活，寫得像牛馬一樣的痛苦。結論是人拉人的現象得永遠絕跡。</p>
<p>他做好演講稿以後，接着就對了一面鏡子預先習講了一番，他的一雙眼珠突出着，一張大嘴巴直冒着熱汽，講得激昂的時候，發着宏大的聲音，把隔壁房間睡着的妻兒們都吵醒了。</p>
<p>每天都是一樣，在八點鐘的時候，阿喜拉着車送少爺小姐上學校，接着又拉太太上小菜塲，回來以後，大概在十點左右，再送科長上縣政府辦公。</p>
<p>可是今天的情形有些不同，把太太從小菜場拉回來的時候，科長急得在大門口發脾氣。</p>
<p>「你們誤我的事，誤我的事！」</p>
<p>「你不是每大要在十點鐘上辦公廳嗎？」太太回答着。</p>
<p>「你不知道，九點鐘有一個會，我要去演講呢！」說着，石科長跳上了車子：「快拉！」</p>
<p>一輛漆得光亮的黑色包車，石科長坐在上面，他戴着一頂皮帽，頸項縮在皮大衣的領裏，右腿架在左腿上，露着脚上雪亮的皮鞋尖。</p>
<p>阿喜在喘着氣流着汗，很快地拉着，跑着，車上插着的紅綠鷄毛帚，在舞擺着。</p>
<p>「快！快拉！眞不中用！」石科長仍舊感到不滿足，一面在踏着脚鈴，一面在呌着，阿喜拼命地直向前衝。</p>
<p>石科長已經遠遠地見到縣政府門前掛着一幅布的廣告：「廢止人力車座談會」。他咳了兩聲，掃一掃喉嚨，預備要在座談會上發出驚人的言論；那知道阿喜因爲餓着肚子跑了許多路，感到精疲力盡，忽然一陣頭暈，兩腿一軟，就跌在地上了。車子和車上人也跟着跌了下來。</p>
<p>「死東西！沒用的東西！人力車趕快要廢除！要廢除！……」石科長一面駡着，一面爬起來，舉起他雪亮的皮鞋尖，恨恨地踢着阿喜的身子。</p>
<p>結果，阿喜仍奮掙扎着起來，拉着石科長衝進縣政府大門。</p>
<h3>溫暖的敬意</h3>
<p>— 陳因譯</p>
<p>狄更司曾經說對於他的工作最溫暖的敬意是某一天他經過紐約所遇見的。當時有一個不相識的女人認出了這位大作家，便伸出手來說：「狄更司先生，你可願意讓我握握那隻使我的家中充江那麽多好朋友的手嗎？</p>
<h3>負着重載的牲口</h3>
<p>— 冒亨作·夢農譯</p>
<p>當你第一次在路上看見苦力負載着重重的東西時，你會覺得它是一種使人悅目的景物。穿的是破破爛爛的藍衫，或帶靛銅色，或帶綠玉色，或帶乳黃色，跟自然界的景色極諧和面相襯。當他沿着稻田塍走着或是藜援着青山面前進的時候，看來是很健步的。他所穿的僅僅是一件短衫和一條袴子。即使他初穿時是一件完整的新衣，當它需要補衲的時候，他也決不煩心到選用一塊同樣色彩的布去加以修補。手頭有什麽，便補什麽。不論天晴天雨，他總是戴着一頂帽邊特別闊大而扁平的舊草帽——像熄燈帽那樣的草帽。</p>
<p>你也可以看見一行列的苦力，一個接着一個的跋涉過來，各人的肩頭都有一根扁祖，扁担的兩端吊着兩個大包裏，形成了一種好看的圖案。看看他們快步地涉水而過的倒影，是非常有趣的。當他們掠過你眼前的時候，你不妨對他們的臉孔細細地端詳一番。只要你不曾被東方是神秘的那種成見所灌迷，那麽一定曾說，他們的那副面孔，是善良，是率眞。當你看見他們放下重負，躺倒在凉亭旁邊榕樹之下，抽起烟來，或高高興興地聊起天來的時候，如果你試去提一提他們一天要挑負一百里光景的大包裹，你自然而然會震驚於他們的耐心之强，和精力之佳。但如果你拿你這種觀感訴之於中國的老百姓，那他們是會認爲不値一笑的。他們並且會聳聳肩膀，告訴你說：苦力就是牲口一類的東西，而且父親傳給兒子，兒子又傳給孫子，兩千年來都毫不變更的負載過重重的東四，因此，他們對於這事情，都幹得高高興興，是不足驚異的。眞的，你可以看見，他們幹這事情，是在年輕時就已經開始的。你會遇見年紀輕輕的孩子們，肩頭一個重聯，挑的是重重的菜　子正在蹣跚而過</p>
<p>歲月像流水一樣消逝過去，天氣漸漸地暖和起來。苦力們脫下了短衫，袒露着上身而開始出現在人們的面前了。有時候，他暫時休息一下了，他的重負已經放給下，但他的扁担還是擱置在肩上，因此他不得不微微地傴着背，這時你可以瞧一瞧那可憐的衰弱的心臟多麽緊急地敲擊着他的肋骨；像在醫院病室中對心臟病患者的情形看得一樣淸楚。看這光景，是够悽苦的。你不妨再瞧一瞧苦力們的背脊。多多少少的年頭兒，一天又一天的，扁担的重壓已經壓出了紅紅的硬硬的創痕，有時甚至壓成裂開了的瘡疤，壓出了全無繃帶或服裝的和竹頭木片磨擦而成的大瘡疤。面最奇特的是：有時候，造物彷彿有意　傳　　　　　　　　　　的苦役似的，一個畸形的隆隆然突起的東西，在肩頭形成了，像駝峯一樣，讓扁担可以擱置在那裏。不管心臟的劇跳，不管瘡疤的腫痛，也不管暴雨的侵襲，不管烈日的熱灸，他們總是永遠地永遠地前進着，從朝一直到夜，從年頭一直到臘尾，從兒童時代一直到風燭殘年。你還可以瞧一瞧那些老頭兒，身上已經連一兩的脂肪也沒有，皮膚像是跟骨骼脫離了似的鬆弛不堪，枯乾得很，瘦小的面孔皺　得彷彿猴子一樣，頭髪都呈現着稀疏的蒼白的樣子。他們蹣跚地前進着，在重重的負載之下，向着那獲取他們長後安息的墓墳的邊緣進着。然而，苦力們依然是前進着，不像奔跑，也不像散步，而是迅速地走着，眼睛儘是一邊可視着地面，一邊就發脚，趕路，臉孔儘是呈現着緊張的忙迫的表情。你再也沒法搆成他們趕路的那幅圖案。他們喫力的情能使你起一種壓迫之感。你不由得不油然地充塞着一片空泛的同情。</p>
<p>在中國，負着重載的牲口，便是人。</p>
<p>「受盡了人生的磨折，怱忽地過度其一生的行程而絲毫不能緩緩進行者，不是眞太可憐了嗎？無休止的勞役，絲毫不能在活着的時候享受其成果，只是盡瘁一生，溘然長逝，而又不知其歸宿是在哪裏——這可不就是一種苦痛之起因嗎」！中國神秘主義的哲學家如是說。</p>

<h3>風景</h3>
<p>— 德·可可綏楷</p>
<h3>長堤</h3>
<p>— 林詠泉</p>
<p>長渠傍長堤而流着。</p>
<p>長堤導引着長渠，衛　着長渠。</p>
<p>長渠如一條綿，鞭的帶子，</p>
<p>靜靜地偎臥於長堤之旁。</p>
<p>長堤因長林而顯現，</p>
<p>長林是保育着長堤的，</p>
<p>長林底根鬚與長堤底泥土盤結，</p>
<p>而長堤愈固，長渠愈安寗。</p>
<p>春天，渠水淸澈而明潔，</p>
<p>長堤遍生着繁花茂草。</p>
<p>而渠水鑽潤於堤土之深處，</p>
<p>滋養着花草，滋養着長林。</p>
<p>長林苗條約　姿倒映在渠水裏；</p>
<p>花草美麗的面顏攬照在渠水裏；</p>
<p>渠水有着曼妙的圖畫了，</p>
<p>而淙的水流聲，又與羣鳥底歌聲應合着。</p>
<p>多長的小徑伸寫在長堤上；</p>
<p>多少活潑的鳥雀飛竄在長林中；</p>
<p>多少弓形的古石橋跨越着長渠；</p>
<p>多少默然的遠行人撫石橋而過啊。</p>
<p>到長堤來啊，</p>
<p>你擅繪的來繪聲繪影啊，</p>
<p>你　歌的來參加合唱之羣啊，</p>
<p>你沉默者來這兒的石橋邊坐坐啊。</p>
<p>他曳着長林底長影而去了，</p>
<p>他携着羣鳥底歌譜而去了，</p>
<p>她挽着她底愛戀黯然消逝，</p>
<p>長林，長堤，與長渠在竊竊私語着。</p>
<h3>宫灯</h3>
<p>— 克人</p>
<p>那用枬木或斑竹做成架子，以深紅的絲絛纏紥着，四面到八面嵌滿大小玻璃，每年正月家家隆重地燃上紅燭懸揖起來，在故一鄉是呌做宮燈的。</p>
<p>宮燈不同於風燈，八角紗燈，以明角燈，壁燈之類，那些不過是掛在宅門口，牆壁和天花板上，用漆紙或紗羅或玻璃装紮着，一半點綴佳節一半照明的；而宮燈却含有雍容富貴的氣氛，敬神祈福的意義，一向被端正地懸在大廳或客堂上的。</p>
<p>宮燈原是古代宮廷的用品，後來潮漸傳到民間的；它走進富貴人家的大廳上，它也走進四壁土牆的庄稼人家，就是寒苦無告的孤兒寡婦的草堂裏，偶然也會不嫌窮酸的安身下來了。而家家從此有了宮燈；宮燈的打扮從此也就有濃　簡陋的分別了。歲初忽賭宮燈曳落牆角的片片紅光，人心便充滿溫暖和希望：今年的麥穗要　實面大熟了，膝下小兒子將愈長愈結實了。</p>
<p>宮燈的絳紗或玻璃上彩繪着的，往往是劇曲話本中婦孺通曉的民間故事，例如「桃園結義」，「天官賜福」，「麻姑獻壽」之類。小兒女總是喜歡紅燈的，宮燈便迷惑了他們童年的夢，從小他們就憧憬着天官，仙人，和英雄了；雖然這種夢到後來一一粉碎了，但偶一念及童年時對宮燈的印象，還是親切而神秘的。</p>
<p>在有好月亮的夜裏，或當晚來大雪紛飛，遍野銀粧的時候，宮燈幌動着的紅光，該是哀怨而憂鬱的。我想起封建王朝宮廷裏失寵老去的妃子，和千百個辜負了靑春的宮女們，在月光雪光燈光下灑落的眼淚。</p>
<p>……我想着。</p>
<p>這是活在什麼日子裏呀？我竟無端無緒的提起宮燈來，故鄉此時想已沒有再懸點着驚宮燈的人家了，這眞如「白頭宮女話天寳遺事」，是會令人疲倦而神傷的</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　177</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>湊巧，我們把計劃剛要硏究完畢，這一個小會集，也剛要結束，正式着手突擊上的準備利行動的當口，「〇四」的手下，拿着兩份秘電進來，一發自東京，一發自瀋陽。兩封密電，都是答覆鶴見關於「八」的問題的：奇怪的一點，瀋陽的電文內容，却比東京「〇十二」的，還要詳蓋得多：</p>
<p>「平，密，急萍子係松組八號，咸子係蘭組八號，另有芳子係特組八號，喜子係梅組八號，喜子現尚在東京受訓，下月調滬，芳子主持華南。「八」的秘密，此處無聞，萍子無法接近，當「勉强」，藩，三一五。」</p>
<p>我把電文宣佈後，W君和耀羣發生了高度興趣，同時笑着問我，「怎麽這麼多『八』？小老虎聽得要笑了，然又竭力摹倣大人派頭，把笑忍回去了。</p>
<p>「問題多哪！」我隨意這麽答覆他們。隨即又把鶴見和我所研究『八』的問題和經過，簡略說明出來。</p>
<p>W君對鶴見所親明『八個先頭祕密站的話，補充了一點意見。他說日本人一切　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，是假定旣經佔領區的行動總站，眞正的秘密特務站，恐怕是英國心臟倫敦，及其他軍港附近，美國的華盛頓，及巴拿馬；蘇聯的莫斯科，等等。</p>
<p>羣擬思了一會，忽地問着鶴見和我們：『日本人這次發動侵略戰，在我們國內，一共有幾個大規模的秘密行動站？』</p>
<p>鶴見好像忽然拾到一柄打開秘密金窟的鑰匙一般立刻跳起來，把桌上一堆書籍壓着的一張地圖，抽了出來展開，口裏數着一，二，…手上用鉛筆劃着圈：</p>
<p>「嘿，至少三十多個大站！』鶴見喃喃自語，又似乎是說給我們聽的；但立時又像發現了什麼秘密似的大聲嚷道，…「慢着！」一面又搯出了他那本萬寳全書的小記事册，縐起眉尖，細心翻閱。</p>
<p>我在一旁，默默觀察鶴見的動作和神態，分析他的心理，我看出他這時有兩種不同的表現；一種是天眞的坦白，一種是靑年的好勝：他在展開地圖，一面數一面劃圈的當口，完全如同小孩子一般—心有所得，立即公開。但在這時候，大的瞥見　羣有走過去帮忙的意思，所以立刻大聲　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　數學難題，演算得差不多到了答案了，因爲好勝關係，不願人家來帮忙。</p>
<p>耀羣大的也明瞭鶴見這時的心理變化，所以聽他一　立刻又坐到原位上；盈盈注視鶴見，等候他的答案。從一陣一陣吐出的濃烟裏，我看見W君眼角傳出的笑意。</p>
<p>『對了！』鶴見眼睛還注射在小記事册上，口裏吐出了這兩個字。說着又在地圖上，一面劃圈，一面數着，從一直數到八。數畢，重又細心斟酌似的，複數了一遍。</p>
<p>『大家都來看！』鶴見仍舊注視着地圍：喊的口氣，很像演西洋景的山東佬；只少了一套小鑼小鈸。</p>
<p>『三十多個小區，可以歸並成八個大區。』鶴見把地圖上的大小圈都數給我們瞧。</p>
<p>瀋陽的總站除外，鶴見把津平到大同畫在一個圈內，濟南爲中心，算是第二圈；太原中心一圈，武漢一圈，滬寗一圈，其餘就是廣州，昆明，宜昌，等三個圈，總共八大區。說明可分區的道理，鶴見又從他的記事册裏，念出八個人名，正是主持這八個大區的魔王。這麽一對證，們微當下都認爲這一個發見，正是揭露了萍子口裏的「八之秘密。」僅僅只有W君，我微沉吟了一下，似乎相信得本大十分透徹。</p>
<h3>張家阿姨　在廚房裏發楞</h3>
<p>— 珠光</p>
<p>張家阿姨，道位新搬來的後廂房年輕的主婦，今天從小菜塲回來像是着了魔似的，目瞪口呆，直是站在廚房裏發楞。</p>
<p>這世界眞在發瘋了，前幾天說是黃金漲，美鈔升，這幾天該是平穩了，但日用物品可依然還是不肯跌。</p>
<p>小菜塲裏的菜販們全像着了魔，向他們買菜買肉倒像是不給錢的，那股氣熖萬丈的「慓」勁兒呀，可眞要氣死人，說是多賣多蝕本，還說是金子快到一千萬呢！</p>
<p>「荳腐要賣肉價鈿」，這日子，簡直是荳腐賣到金價鈿了。往常三五千元小菜，雖不能大魚大肉，但五顏六色的總也可以煮這麽三五隻菜，今天可不然了——還不够買一斤肉。</p>
<p>翻着淺淺舖在籃底的小菜，她重復咕噥着方才小菜塲裏鬧哄哄的市價：</p>
<p>猪肉五千元一斤，帶魚二千元一條，雞蛋三百五，蚶子二千四，螺絲八百元起碼，連靑菜黃豆芽也得六百元一斤。</p>
<p>可不是油，糖，醬，醋，鹽的價錢，也莫不如此。金子九百五十萬，白米十八萬的時候，食廳五百元，白糖四千元，荳油三千二，而今金子白米全小了，只是這些東西不肯落價。</p>
<p>使我們張家阿姨更爲莫明其妙的，是這幾天燃料的市價，不但未見隨金子面俱跌，反而還在冉冉上升呢。譬如煤球吧，當天（黃金白米最高峰的那一天）煤球每担二萬五，今天倒反漲到三萬三了，原先炭是五百元一斤，今天也漲了一倍，那天火油跳到一千二（每斤），人們已經感到驚奇了，但今天却終於到了一千五。</p>
<p>亭子問嫂嫂堆着滿臉笑容蘭進來，說是香烟今天跌價了，十支大英牌只賣七百元，前門（廿支）三千元，早幾天大英一千一，前門要賣四千外。亭子閒嫂嫂瞇着眼睛盡是笑，還說：美國貨的六根（幸運）牌早先賣到四千元，今天跌剩二千六了。</p>
<p>但後廂房的張家阿姨是素不吸烟的，香烟跌價，與她無涉，她只是看着煤油爐上靑色的火熖在苦笑。（二月十六日）　她對着煤油爐上青色的火焰苦笑</p>
<h3>公務員　　歌頌德政</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>在這一個多星期來，黃金白米和必需日用品，驚人的飛漲，引起着薪水階級的極度恐慌，尤其是一般不依照「生活指數」的公務員，坐在寫字問喪；「眼　報章」「耳聽消息」一個個在發慌！</p>
<p>講到公務員的薪水，在去年十二月份調整之後，是十七萬元和一千一百倍的加成數，以一百元低薪而論，共計二十八萬元，在當時可購五担米，而照現在的米價，僅可購米二担，無形中已加了一倘「四扣」。</p>
<p>唯其是如此，公務員都引起了極度的「悲愴」。</p>
<p>政府當局，擬議公務員「配售實物」，有米，油，煤，糖，鹽，布等六棟。同時公務員的待遇，底數將增至卅五萬元，基本數增至千三百倍，在十五日本報登着這兩段消息。</p>
<p>一般公務員，看到這兩段「好消息」，不免「雀躍三百」，歌頌德政了。</p>
<p>但是仔細地想起來，却又發生着一種漪漣的「感觸」，那過去公教人員「配給」的東西，質又不好，價又不便宜，尤其是配價老是追隨着「黑市騰漲」，這些「憂慮」，以後可以澄淸麼？</p>

<h3>但願手輕脚健　百病永不上身　西藥行市跳躍·可病不得呵呵！</h3>
<p>— 朱廣</p>
<p>這年頭，再也沒有比生病吃藥更可怕的事情了。即使是頭痛傷風，感冒小恙，若要早獲痊愈，乞靈於藥石，那末動輙便是數千元乃至數萬元，醫生的診費還不計在內，至於藥味苦澀，難於下嚥更在其次！</p>
<p>這次黃金漲風，物價跳得最凶的是西藥，不僅漲勢猛烈，簡直報價亂喊，有行無市，一般持貨商人活像驟然間變成「無價至寳」的擁有者了。</p>
<p>當黃金喊高九百五十萬，白沐漲到十八九萬的那一天，幾稱熱門的日用藥品，簡直出了高價也無處搜購，這情景眞像是世界末日果眞已經到來了一樣。</p>
<p>拜耳藥廠出品與美國貨的新藥，若有持貨者肯脫手，那末在「祗要寳寳肯開口」的情形之下，莫不爭先恐後的搶購一空，如拜耳的阿司匹靈（十片）一萬五，加當（十片）四萬，克利西佛（每瓶）二萬五至三萬，黑獅六〇本（每支）五萬五至六萬，度冷丁針二十八至三十萬（每盒）。他如美貨藥品，消發地亞淨（每千粒）三十萬，消發噻唑（每千粒）十三四萬，六〇六每枝一萬二，孟山都糖精每磅四十七萬，雙桃奎寗四十五萬，上項貨品，偶爾能買到，在那天，眞要算是「幸運」了。</p>
<p>不僅外國貨如此，國產新藥也如脫　野馬，瘋狂奔騰。以一般市民家常使用最爲普遍的幾種藥品面言，萬金油「大行情」（每打）三萬八九千，門市另買時這麼小小的一個圓合子，便是四千千元，他如八卦丹，頭痛粉等也都一樣。所謂「小兒良藥」的鷓鴣菜，竟亦跳到六萬八至七萬元，消治龍片劑針劑，都在四千五至五千左右，藥膏也漲到了二千五。</p>
<p>自從政府聲言即將公佈緊急措施，在平金價，一面委派大員，來滬澈查賬目，西藥行市也隨之逐日下降，在一般商品市塲中，西藥是或多或　具有投機性的商品之一種，因爲它實銷的作用遠不及「籌碼」的作用來得更大。也就因此，這幾天市價的下跌，比較其他商品，更爲顯著而迅速。</p>
<p>即以上述各種藥品而論，大抵都跌價百分之二十至四十不等。下表所列，是截至政府公布新匯率前爲止的最後市價：</p>
<p>阿司匹靈八千至一萬元，加當三萬，克利西佛二萬二千，黑獅六〇六四萬三，度冷丁針十八九萬。美貨消發地亞淨十八萬，消發噻唑儿萬，六〇六五千元，孟山都糖精三十九萬，雙桃奎寗三十八至四十萬，國產新藥萬金油每打二萬八，門售三千元，八卦丹自四萬跌至三萬，頭痛粉也跌到二萬二，鶴鴣菜已跌進六萬元。</p>
<p>雖然如此，比諸黃金漲風之前，這些價目還是高出好多。就說三四千塊錢買包八卦丹吧，算來該也是够呌人難於負擔的了。至於　　　　　　　　　　　　多肺新」那樣的藥品，像你我這樣的「小市民」是壓根兒就無福嘗試的。聽說初到時每一克需費三四十萬，前幾天最低的行市也得廿五萬左右。雖說「特效」，終也不一定能「起死回生」，何况即使有這個「特效」，至少也非得三四十支不爲功呢！</p>
<p>但消息傳來，說是外滙率調整到一萬二千比一了，跌價的西藥，看來是曇花一現，看來又將上漲了。</p>
<p>從此但願淡飯三碗，手輕脚健，連傷風咳嗽的小病都能永不上身，我說，這年頭，西藥這樣貴，難道還有比生病吃藥更可怕的事嗎，朋友，你說是不是？！</p>
<h3>市井淺語</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>近日金價物價，漲勢與跌風互見，但畢竟是漲得多，跌得少，漲得快，跌得慢，漲得像在跳，跌得像在爬。但願它「跳得高，跌得重」！</p>
<p>三色恐怖包圍着全國市民：白色指白米，黃色指黃金，而其中掀風作浪者，還是黑色，這是指一切「黑心」的投機活動。當局的唯一對策，在目前就是加緊澈查這些「三色恐怖份子」，不久，這些囤積肥己者將無法遁身，必至全數抑平而後已。這簡直是「死鬼要賬，活該活該」！</p>
<p>物價越漲，投機越盛，反過來看，投機越盛，物價亦成正比例的越漲。這是當前的經濟大危機，正所謂：「紙糊的板櫈兒，做（坐）不得！」</p>
<p>大投機家沒看見自己搗蛋，却偏偏說是人家　事，此之謂「丈八燈臺，照遠不照近」！</p>
<h3>一個小商人　談化學工業原料</h3>
<p>— 韓沁</p>
<p>無意間遇到了幾年不見的遠房表兄，堅邀我到他店裏去坐一會兒，好在路還不遠，便跟了他去。</p>
<p>靠近中匯大樓一帶，有不少化學原料號，他領我走進了一家去。</p>
<p>「你幾時搬來這兒住的？」我有點奇怪。</p>
<p>「好幾年了，自從我和幾個朋友，打夥開了這家原料號以後，便住進此此地來。」</p>
<p>我記得他從前是做出版生意的，怎麼一會改做化學原料起來，問他，他笑了。</p>
<p>「你從前不是學畫圖的嗎？現在怎麼到交易所裏去做了呢？？」</p>
<p>我被問得無話可說，他却絮絮地告訴我，這家店開起初生意很不錯，但在舊年下半年生意十分淸淡，坐吃了半年多，若是今年再無起色，他又想要改行了。我欽　他的善於經營之後，外行地問他：</p>
<p>「你們這兒可以做多少生意一天呢？」</p>
<p>他笑了起來，「我們靠門市生意有　得很，這許多老　和伙討早餓死了，主要還是靠大批進出，熟悉的客戶一個電話來，我們就成交，因爲我們資本短，自己存貨並不多，在這麽高利息之下，自己不敢背進，還是代客賣買做成一筆交易，爲數也很可觀。去年年底化工原料的市價忽然動了，今年一開春，隨着外匯飛漲，原料也跟着漲起來，有幾樣東西，告訴你不相信，簡直漲上了幾百倍！」</p>
<p>我担起心來，問道：「這和民生有關嗎？」</p>
<p>「說有關，那樣東西和民生無關？但貨價要漲，却不是我們這些代客賣買的人能操縱的。」</p>
<p>「究竟漲得怎樣呢？說點熟門的聽聽看！」</p>
<p>「像舊年廢曆年底，燒鹼不過三百萬一筒，黃凡士林不過五六百塊，小蘇打祗三四萬元，白油祗念萬左右，甘油也祗三四十萬元。現在燒鹸要六百萬，黃凡士林一千元，小蘇打十五六萬，白油近一百萬左右，甘油要八十幾萬了」。</p>
<p>「這會影響工業品的本嗎」？</p>
<p>他諷刺地笑着：「這就不必問我了」。</p>
<p>「那麽，和外國貨競爭的問題呢」？我索性做傻瓜到底。</p>
<p>「我又不是經濟學家」。</p>
<p>不錯，他不過是個小商人，他也不過祗能告訴我市價是這樣情形吧了。至於影響生活一類問題，還議我們自己去解答吧。</p>
<h3>電影院</h3>
<p>— 路</p>
<p>拒絕批駁悍然加價</p>
<p>電影院拒絕社會局漲價的批駁，「悍然」加價了。一家戲院最高的票價是七千元，而門口的黑市却呌一萬二千元。</p>
<p>假使我有很多的美金的話，那倒是挺方便的，因爲官價是一萬二呵，可是……</p>
<h3>我們不是牛　向「可的」公司提抗議</h3>
<p>— 果華</p>
<p>我是「可的」牛奶公司一個忠實的飲戶，十年如一日，至今不　。可是在最近的將來，我們的關係恐怕要中斷了。</p>
<p>以最近的一年來說，自從勝利以後，美貨如潮湧來，克寗奶粉的傾　，使牛奶公司感到威脅，許多飲戶都不再訂飲而改吃奶粉了，然而我們這些老定戶却矢志不渝。這一半固然是由於惰性，一半却由於相當的情誼，希望這樣能使牛奶公司維持下去。</p>
<p>我們以此待公司，公司却不以此待飲戶。一再漲價的事那倒不必說了，然而最近突然漲價百分之五十，並且要預先付款（定半磅須先付九萬元，漲復以前是三萬九千元一月），否則便須按日繳款，那就太對不起飲戶了。</p>
<p>牛奶公司從未吃過飲戶的倒賬，尤其是我們老定戶，公司不應這樣不信任我們，要我們先付鉅款，或者以普通的零購戶相音。</p>
<p>牛奶公司對於物價的看法，似乎也太刺激人心了。黃金與美鈔都並不是每天漲價，何以牛奶就要有天天調整的準備，我們不信公司天天在計算生活指數，更不信公司的支出（如工資草料等）也按日計算，按日漲價。</p>
<p>被牛奶公司所榨取的，應該是一條一條乳牛，而不是作爲忠實主顧的飲戶。然而現在公司彷彿要將榨乳的手段，用在我們飲身上了。</p>
<p>我不願做這樣牛，因此我說在最近的將來，恐怕要將十年的親睦關係，斷絕於一旦。</p>
<p>我現在的手段是決不先付，等待停送。並且呼籲飲戶同志們，都不要做牛。因爲從我們身上榨出來的，究竟不是營養大衆的牛奶，而是鉅　的現款和拆息啊。</p>

<h3>Emergency Measures to Stabilize People's Livelihoods: National Government Orders Strict Implementation. Total Amount of People's Overseas Deposits Exceeds US$300 Million; List Already Investigated, Self-Declaration Required.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The National Government issued an order on the 17th, stating that in view of the current economic situation, which is sufficient to affect the livelihoods of all citizens and lead to significant social unrest, the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" has been specially formulated. It was submitted to the 218th Standing Committee Meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, which resolved: "(1) To amend and pass the plan; (2) To submit the penalty sections in the respective measures to the Legislative Yuan for supplementary legislation; (3) All people, companies, or organizations of the Republic of China with foreign exchange deposited abroad shall voluntarily declare it to the government. This foreign exchange deposit, except for legitimate uses, shall be purchased by the government periodically at the statutory exchange rate. Those who fail to declare, refuse to sell, or deposit it in domestic banks shall be severely punished. Detailed implementation measures shall be promptly drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted for approval." In addition to separate distributions, copies of the relevant documents are hereby issued to the relevant parties, ordering them to act accordingly and strictly comply. They are also instructed to direct their subordinates to take full responsibility, earnestly comply, and strictly implement this order, which is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Economic Emergency Measures Plan has been promulgated, and the response from all quarters has been extremely positive. The Economic Policy Research Committee will hold another meeting in the coming days to continue discussing fundamental measures to stabilize people's livelihoods and stabilize finance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The government is fully determined to stabilize prices and will strictly implement the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, effectively control prices, guide floating capital to invest in productive enterprises, and strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and manipulating prices. Such merchants will be severely punished.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The Four Joint Offices held an extraordinary meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, attended by responsible persons from various national banking bureaus, to discuss the strict implementation of various loans under the "Measures for Strengthening the Management of Financial Operations," focusing on assisting the increased production of daily necessities and export goods. Amounts of 50 million yuan or more must be approved by the Four Joint Offices; otherwise, they cannot be granted. The handling banks and bureaus shall be fully responsible for conducting investigations and assessing the uses of loan applications in advance. All surplus funds from the various banks and bureaus shall be deposited in the Central Bank and shall not be transferred to provincial and municipal banks or commercial firms through foreign exchange purchases, rediscounting, or other means. When military, political, and state-owned enterprise agencies use deposit funds, they must use crossed checks. When cash withdrawals are necessary, the purpose must be stated.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The total amount of foreign exchange deposited abroad by Chinese nationals exceeds US$300 million. The government has already investigated the list of depositors. If depositors do not voluntarily declare, the government will publish their names when necessary and impose penalties. Some economic experts believe that it would be better for the government to borrow these funds rather than purchase them at the statutory exchange rate. Other experts advocate using long-term bonds to collect these deposits.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] After the exchange rate was raised to 12,000 yuan, the issue of remittances to Hong Kong should not be as serious as in the past. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission previously consulted with the Overseas Department, the Ministry of Finance's Treasury Department, and the four banks of Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture to determine a remittance subsidy method, deciding to adopt an import and export subsidy method to subsidize 100%. However, since the announcement of the Emergency Measures Plan, this method is no longer necessary.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Stores in Various Locations Close Down; Ministry of Finance Plans Handling Measures; Prices Fall in Beiping, Hankou, and Taipei.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] After the government announced the suspension of public trading of gold and banknotes, all gold shops, jewelry stores, and US dollar trading shops in Nanjing closed their doors on the morning of the 17th. It is reported that the guilds verbally notified them separately and scheduled a meeting that afternoon to discuss whether to continue trading jewelry. According to Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, this is an inevitable phenomenon after the government implemented emergency measures. The bureau has decided to follow government instructions and will not pay attention to the closure of businesses.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The ten money exchange shops here that deal in US dollars have voluntarily removed their glass signs because the government has ordered a ban on foreign currency transactions. According to an employee of a large jewelry store, there are about 40 large jewelry stores in Nanjing. If the government permanently bans the sale of gold and silver jewelry, the number of jewelry store employees who will lose their jobs will reach 2,000.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Finance is drafting measures to handle the processing of gold jewelry made by jewelry stores and will soon announce and implement them. Today, all jewelry stores and foreign currency exchange shops in Nanjing are closed, with their doors locked. The Nanjing branch of the Central Bank has not yet received orders from the Shanghai head office, so it has not started purchasing foreign currency or posting prices for gold purchases today. There was no price fluctuation today.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 17th] All jewelry stores in the county are closed today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th] After receiving news of the government's financial controls, the trading of silver ingots immediately stopped. Most gold shops did not open, and only a few jewelry stores had scattered sales. Other commodity prices remained stable, and the restless public sentiment has calmed down.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th] All gold shops in Kunming have stopped trading today, and the Gold Industry Association convened an emergency meeting. From today, there is no market for gold or foreign currency. Cotton yarn and cloth prices have fallen in unison due to the suspension of the gold industry. Da Mei Heng cloth (per bolt) is 360,000 yuan. Department stores remain firm and brisk. Rice prices have fallen, with top-grade rice at 58,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th] After the Supreme National Defense Council decided on emergency economic measures to suspend gold trading and raise foreign exchange rates, all jewelry stores in Hangzhou closed. Guerrilla merchants who collected gold on the streets also disappeared. Foreign goods have risen in price, with newspapers now costing 150,000 yuan each. Daily necessities are also stirring. Rice prices are now shouting for 130,000 yuan. The general public is both happy and worried, just like the gloomy and snowy weather today.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Allocates Low-Priced Rice</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th] The food situation for Hangzhou residents is becoming increasingly serious, especially for public servants and teachers. With the provincial government allocating 100,000 dan of grain, the Civil Food Regulation Committee is allocating it in the form of low-priced rice, which has somewhat calmed the public's mind. It is understood that the Financial Department has telegraphed the counties in the Fuchun River basin and along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to immediately transport 50,000 dan of grain to Hangzhou, with the expectation of reaching 73,000 dan in March.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] After the government's emergency economic measures were announced, commodity prices in Beiping generally declined, such as the highest-grade flour produced in Beiping, which fell to 68,000 yuan per bag. However, buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and very few transactions have been made. The order to prohibit the circulation of gold and US dollars has not yet arrived in Beiping, so the exchange industry is operating as usual today. The US dollar is offered at 12,400 and purchased at 12,000. Gold is traded in the black market at 640,000.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] After the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was announced, rice and commodity prices in Taiwan have stabilized somewhat. Rice is 36 yuan per catty, and first-grade white sugar is 95 yuan per catty. During the period of soaring prices, public enterprises in Taiwan Province did not raise prices. Chief Executive Chen Yi also ordered a 10% reduction in the prices of trains, tap water, and electricity. Chen believes that the prices of various commodities in non-public enterprises should also be lowered. This afternoon, he ordered the Civil Affairs Department to convene trade associations in Taipei to discuss pricing matters, hoping to gradually reduce the prices that have been rising recently. The Bank of Taipei is purchasing gold and collecting US dollars. Today's listed prices are 11,500 NT dollars per tael of gold, 158 yuan for US dollars, and 34 yuan for Hong Kong dollars, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] The Suzhou Provincial Government has recently telegraphed the county governments, stating that the prices of daily necessities in the counties along the Shanghai-Nanjing line must not exceed 70% of those in Shanghai; otherwise, the respective administrative officials will be held accountable. The Suzhou County Government has now begun investigating and stabilizing prices.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender in Hong Kong; Market Conditions Improve</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 17th] After the Chinese government announced its emergency financial control plan, the market conditions for legal tender in Hong Kong improved. This morning, the opening price for 100,000 yuan of legal tender was equivalent to 41 Hong Kong dollars, while the price last Saturday was 37 and a half Hong Kong dollars for 100,000 yuan of legal tender. Gold prices have fallen, with the opening price at 277 Hong Kong dollars per ounce, while the closing price last Saturday was 291 Hong Kong dollars per ounce. A Chinese banker here told our reporter that it is doubtful whether the new plan will be effective, especially the order for foreign currency holders to exchange legal tender at the official rate, which may be difficult to receive a widespread response.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting; Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The 315th meeting of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 20th. Another meeting will be held on the 21st, and President Song Ziwen will be invited to report to the Legislative Yuan. Meeting notices were sent out yesterday.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prevent Gold; Smuggling Out of the Country</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Among the government's announced Economic Emergency Measures, there is a clause prohibiting the carrying of gold bars out of the country, with violators' goods being confiscated and forfeited. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed all customs offices to strictly prevent the smuggling of gold out of the country.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the 13th Anniversary of the New Life Movement; Chairman Broadcasts to the Nation; Emphasizing Its Importance in His Address at the Central Memorial Week Yesterday; Encouraging the Enhancement of Spiritual and Moral Strength</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] On the eve of the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement (18th), Chairman Chiang will broadcast to the nation at 8:00 PM. At that time, the Central Broadcasting Station will broadcast simultaneously via medium wave at "454" meters, short wave at "660" kilocycles, "30.8" meters, "9730" kilocycles, and "25.35" meters, "11835" kilocycles, and all broadcasting stations across the country will rebroadcast on time.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] At 9:00 AM on the 17th, the Central Government held an expanded Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, he gave an impromptu address, explaining the importance of the New Life Movement in the current stage of national construction. Excerpts from the address are as follows:</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow (19th) is the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement. I have a separate announcement to encourage compatriots nationwide. When the New Life Movement was initiated, we relied on the efforts of our compatriots to implement it, which brought about a fundamental change in social customs. In the 26th year, the government resolved to resist Japan, using the New Life Movement as one of the main spiritual forces. Later, our compatriots across the country were inspired and able to defeat the enemy, which is a clear testament to the implementation of the New Life Movement. However, the purpose for which I initiated the New Life Movement was not only to resist foreign aggression but also to regard it as the basic work of national construction. As Sun Yat-sen said, "Spirit is more important than matter; revolution must first reform the heart." The policies of political leaders throughout Chinese history have also prioritized changing customs, because the foundation of a country lies in society. If society cannot establish good customs and if the people cannot adapt to modern life, then the country can never be modernized. However, since the end of the War of Resistance, the remaining poison of the enemy and puppets has not been eradicated, and national order has not been stabilized, leading to a decline in customs, a slump in spirit, a descent into depravity, and a degeneration of society. Those who speculate and seek advantages for themselves consider themselves capable, and those who indulge in excess and ruin are shameless. Propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame have been swept away. The recent financial turmoil in Shanghai is clear evidence of this. Therefore, today, only by vigorously implementing the New Life Movement and enhancing spiritual and moral strength can we save the social crisis.</p>
<p>The essence of the New Life Movement lies in incorporating the four pillars of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame into daily life. Therefore, the implementation of the New Life Movement must begin with the transformation of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Everyone must examine their own lives and actions to see if they meet the six conditions of simplicity, frugality, neatness, cleanliness, speed, and certainty mentioned in the New Life Movement. Our party, government, and military personnel should take the lead and thoroughly implement it, extending it from themselves to their families, to the institutions they preside over, and to the entire society. Only in this way can we create a new atmosphere of positivity and form the strength for national construction. The Chairman finally mentioned the appearance of Nanjing, believing that it is very different compared to before the War of Resistance. The Municipal Government, the Police Department, and the Social Affairs and Health Bureaus must urge the Gu, Bao, and Jia and mobilize the people to seek improvement, especially strictly prohibiting public urination and spitting to maintain the city's cleanliness and hygiene. We must not regard these matters as trivial and ignore them. We must know that the distinction between civilization and barbarism lies in this point. We must first achieve neatness and cleanliness before we can talk about other construction.</p>
<h3>Council of Political Affairs Commissioners Reviews Economic Measures; Passes Six Measures for Government Approval</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Council of Political Affairs Commissioners held an extraordinary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 17th. Mo Dehui, Fu Sinian, and others attended, with Jiangnan presiding. They reviewed the Economic Emergency Measures Plan announced by the government on the 16th and discussed the stabilization of prices in great detail, believing that price stabilization should be based on the index of this year's New Year's Day and should not be increased further. They considered the sudden fourfold increase in the adjusted price of US dollars to be inappropriate and believed that the government should give it serious consideration. Regarding the deposits of Chinese nationals abroad, they advocated that the government should borrow them. They then discussed the proposals for finance and economy that had been reviewed and submitted by the review committee and immediately passed them, sending them to the government for approval that same day. The original text is as follows: (1) The Premier of the Executive Yuan and relevant authorities failed to prevent the gold rush, causing great harm to the national economy and people's livelihoods. The Supreme National Defense Council should investigate the responsibility and impose serious punishment. (2) It is recommended that the government form an investigation team jointly with the Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate the current financial situation in Nanjing and Shanghai and the manipulation by bureaucratic capital in this gold rush. (3) The government should properly determine methods to absorb floating capital and use it for productive enterprises. In order to promote the practical development of productive enterprises, those who embezzle production loans or divert them to speculative purposes should be severely punished. (4) Those who use public funds and power for illegal profiteering (including delaying salary payments for profit) should be strictly prohibited. (5) Effective measures should be taken to fully control daily necessities, and frugality must be practiced and waste prohibited. (6) Swiftly formulate measures to stabilize prices, implement them effectively, and strive to restore the price standards of January.</p>
<h3>Positive Response to Emergency Measures; People in Nanjing Believe It Is a Victory for Public Opinion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] According to the opinion of neutral sources in Nanjing, the government's new financial and economic measures are a victory for public opinion. According to these sources, these drastic measures were demanded by just public opinion long ago but had been blocked by bureaucrats and vested interest groups until Chairman Chiang personally intervened to make them a reality. They also said that the government's measures are the most comprehensive to address the economic situation, but their prospects are not optimistic because their effectiveness depends on how they are implemented. Therefore, they pointed out that the implementation of the new measures is the greatest test of the government's administrative efficiency. We must see if the government has sufficient power to prohibit the buying and selling of gold and US dollars, control black market speculation, store gold, freeze gold, and daily necessities, and restore the level of the living index of January.</p>
<p>Lou Tongsun Discusses Measures Plan</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Lou Tongsun, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan, said today that the Supreme National Defense Council's approval of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan shows that the government has recognized the economic crisis and its solution. Lou was the first in the Legislative Yuan to advocate banning gold and foreign currency transactions. It is said that if the measures in the plan can be faithfully implemented, they will be effective in stabilizing the national economy. The government's decision to collect the assets of Chinese people stored abroad to purchase food and major goods is commendable. According to a report from the US Treasury Department, in June 1941, the deposits of Chinese people in the United States were no less than US$356.4 million. If this foreign exchange is purchased by the government, it will make a great contribution to construction. The government should strictly supervise the use of production loans for private companies and factories. In the past, loans were often used for speculative transactions. Another legislator, Jian Guansan, supported Lou's proposal to control gold and foreign currency. It is said that this Economic Emergency Measures Plan is based on the painful economic experiences of the government in the past, implementing the slogans of increasing production to increase tax revenue and simplifying administration to save expenses. Its main purpose is to reduce the degree of inflation in China. Regarding the purchase of US dollar deposits of Chinese people, Jian made a further suggestion, advocating that the government should immediately request the United States. Various banks should temporarily freeze all deposits and securities owned by Chinese people, pending the issuance of 10- to 20-year government bonds by the Chinese government to purchase them. Jian strongly opposed the use of legal tender to purchase foreign exchange deposits, because a large amount of legal tender flooding the country would inevitably harm people's lives.</p>
<p>Two Thoughts from Xu Chuanlin</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] This reporter recently met with Xu Chuanlin, a key member of the Democratic Socialist Party, and asked him for his thoughts on the Economic Emergency Measures Plan. He replied: "I am not familiar with economics and cannot offer sophisticated opinions, but in general terms, I have two thoughts: (1) All current measures should first seek to stabilize people's hearts. If people's hearts are restless, it will have a ripple effect on prices. At the same time, attention should be paid to effectiveness during implementation to avoid causing criticism of the effect and further damaging the government's credibility; (2) It is necessary to prohibit the circulation of foreign currency in our country's market. First, any sovereign country can only use its own currency within its borders; second, our country has suffered eight years of hard fighting, and everything is devastated. Our economic strength is by no means comparable to that of the United States. During this period, if US dollars are circulated domestically and all prices are measured by them, then the purchasing power of legal tender will be even more severely depreciated once compared. I remember that when the British recovered Malaya, they immediately declared the 7 billion military tickets issued by Japan invalid and issued new currency for use. This move was very "poisonous," and overseas Chinese suffered greatly, but purely in technical terms, it was also successful, because they did not want a comparative standard for the country's currency to exist in the newly recovered area when the economy was not stable. Strictly speaking, the circulation of foreign currency should have been prohibited immediately after the victory, not today."</p>
<p>Sun Jiulu Comments on Economic Policy</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Sun Jiulu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, recently commented on the government's gold and foreign exchange policy, saying: "In addition to the objective and irresistible causes that have caused the current financial crisis and economic panic in China, the administrative authorities have been responsible for policy errors in the past. The two largest points are: (1) During the time when Kong Xiangxi was the Minister of Finance, he pegged the US dollar to 20 yuan of legal tender, creating an unreasonable situation in which prices and exchange rates were thousands of times apart. The government's benefit was that foreign currency could come to China and reap this small convenience, and many illegitimate foreign exchanges were used to escape from China at 20 yuan per US dollar. Later, when foreign exchange was raised, prices jumped, and the ratio of prices to exchange rates could never be made reasonable. If the exchange rate is not raised, foreign goods will be imported cheaply, and domestic production enterprises will never be able to stand on their own feet. This is Kong's policy error that he should be responsible for. (2) After the victory, Song Ziwen raised the US dollar exchange rate but supplied importers with unlimited foreign exchange, causing foreign goods to flood the market and preventing domestic production enterprises from surviving. This foreign exchange can be said to have been wasted in the past year, and it was truly a loss to the country. It was too late to use the import quota allocation method after it was out of control. This is Song's policy error that he should be responsible for. As for the government selling gold, the original intention was to contract the currency and suppress prices. I have always believed that this could not be done, so I did not agree with this policy when I was in Chongqing. Today, the government has decided that the Central Bank will no longer sell gold, which should have been done a long time ago, not today. This is different from gold nationalization. Nationalization must be done after political stability and currency stability, so as not to lose credibility with the people. Now the government has stopped selling gold, which means that the government will temporarily not set the legal tender price of gold and allow the people to treat all the gold in their hands as valuable luxury goods for preservation. Gold cannot be eaten or worn. Those who are obsessed with gold can buy it at a high price. Why not? But the only condition is to stabilize the prices of daily necessities so that they no longer rise and fall according to the price of gold. This is the government's serious task."</p>
<h3>Minister Peng's Important Statement; Refuting Foreign Media Distortions of the Chairman's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Minister Peng Xuepei issued the following statement at midnight on the 17th: "I have recently received an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on February 15, as reported in American newspapers. The dispatch contains several errors and distortions; some of its contents appear to be excerpts from Chairman Chiang's informal discussions with several American newspaper publishers and editors but completely change their meaning.</p>
<p>The Associated Press stated: 'Sources close to Chairman Chiang say that Chairman Chiang blames the United States for deciding to stop supplying arms and loans to China, thereby prolonging China's civil war.' I was present at the time, and I feel I must make a serious correction to this immediately. Chairman Chiang did not deny the right of the United States to stop selling arms or providing loans in his speech but expressed his unwillingness to make it public. He said that publicly announcing that the condition for selling arms and providing loans was for China to organize a coalition government containing the Communist Party would only make the CCP's attitude more rigid and refuse to negotiate with the government. To change this to Chairman Chiang blaming the United States for prolonging China's civil war is a clear distortion.</p>
<p>The Associated Press dispatch also said that Chairman Chiang's confidants said that the Chairman believes that if the United States continues to supply arms and loans, the Communist Party problem can be resolved more quickly and its troops can be defeated. This statement is also based on the Chairman's above-mentioned remarks, and the distortion is extremely obvious.</p>
<p>As for what the Associated Press quoted a senior official as saying, that Chairman Chiang deeply regrets that his arguments failed to move President Truman and General Marshall, this statement has not a single word that Chairman Chiang ever mentioned.</p>
<p>The Associated Press dispatch also said that Chairman Chiang sternly refused to accept the documents submitted by the political leaders of the CCP. This is presumably referring to the CCP's so-called document denying the treaties signed by the government. At that time, the responsible personnel in charge of receiving and sending documents in the National Government considered it strange and unfounded for a political party to deny the government's foreign treaties, so they returned the document."</p>

<h3>Northeast Region Telegram and Telephone Fees to be Adjusted Next Month</h3>

<h3>Washington Officials Praise Our Country's Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 17th] Officials and diplomatic circles here today unanimously praised Chairman Chiang's emergency measures to curb China's economic disorder. However, they expressed doubts about whether China's turbulent administrative structure could implement them.</p>
<p>Some people believe that this move is "a step in deciding who should truly lead China." This group believes that Chairman Chiang has realized that the United States cannot mediate China's internal conflicts and that Western economic aid may be insufficient and unable to stabilize China's economic disorder in time. Therefore, he has taken his own strong steps, disregarding the displeasure of outsiders and old forces.</p>

<h3>National Forces Make Progress Between Peiping and Baoding; Communist Forces Launch Counterattack on Xushui and Are Repelled; Fierce Fighting Between Two Armies Outside Jiangcheng</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] National forces have made repeated progress between Peiping and Baoding. The National forces advancing southwest from Yishui and Gucheng reached the south bank of the Baoshui River on the 16th. The Communist forces fled to the mountains. Mancheng is now in sight.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 17th] A small-scale battle is underway in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The Communist forces, with a force three times larger than the National forces, numbering more than 50,000, are maneuvering with the National forces around Baoding and are showing signs of decline. A military expert said that the Communist forces' formation is "one point, two surfaces," forming a triangular shape. Their point in Mancheng is already under the encirclement of the National forces on three sides. The "surface" of Xushui Caohe has also been defeated, and the Communist forces have suffered heavy losses. Now, fierce fighting is taking place in the area of ​​Dawangzhuang, Yaocunzhen, and Suichengzhen, another "surface" west of Xushui. Suicheng has been captured by the National forces. Fierce fighting is underway in Yaocunzhen today. The Communist forces have surrounded Yaocun with six brigades. Strong reinforcements from the National forces arrived last night and encircled them in turn. Military authorities said that the outcome can be decided tonight. After this "surface" of Communist forces is defeated, Mancheng will collapse without being attacked. Rumors that Sun Lianzhong went to Zhuozhou to supervise the battle are inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 17th] At 10 PM on the 16th, 5,000 Communist troops launched a counterattack, re-attacking Xushui, and invaded the South Gate, engaging in fierce fighting with the defending troops.

<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 17th] Two companies of National forces in Dongximacun and Ximacun, 20 li southwest of Zhuoxian in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, were besieged by more than 5,000 Communist troops last night.

<h3>Eight Years of War Devastation; China Suffers Heavy Losses; Report Submitted by the United Nations Secretariat</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York Dispatch, 16th] The United Nations Secretariat has submitted a draft report detailing the tragic devastation suffered by China during the eight years of war. This report serves as the basis for the Far East Working Group on War Disaster Areas to submit a report to the Economic and Social Council next month. The full text of this report has not yet been published, but it is known that this massive document includes a general survey of war disasters in the Far East, as well as the situation in individual countries. The report on the situation in China is as follows:</p>
<p>Nine Million Deaths; Forty Million Houses Needed</p>
<p>(1) Living conditions and manpower: It is estimated that the number of war deaths reached 9 million. At the same time, due to the war, millions of people died from diseases and injuries. Survivors were forced to leave their homes due to poverty, malnutrition, and difficult living conditions. At the same time, due to the lack of education, they have suffered greatly both physically and mentally, and most of them have not been able to return to their homes due to the disruption of transportation and the instability of the situation. (2) Housing problem: Except for Shanghai, it is estimated that China currently needs more than 40 million houses.</p>
<p>School Facilities Extremely Inadequate; Clothing Shortages Difficult to Restore</p>
<p>(3) Education: During the war, educational facilities in the Japanese-occupied areas of China were destroyed by the Japanese, so it is very difficult to promote education in these areas after the war. It is estimated that the number of students enrolled in schools at all levels in China increased greatly in 1946, but the facilities in the schools are still extremely inadequate, especially in middle and high schools. Moreover, China's general education level has declined due to the war. (4) Clothing: At the end of the war, China's cotton production decreased to one-third of its pre-war production. At the same time, due to its slow recovery, in 1946, it still did not reach 38% of pre-war production. This means that the clothing shortage that China has experienced in the past eight years "seems unlikely to be remedied in the long term."</p>
<p>Food Imports Will Continue; 90% of Machinery Lost</p>
<p>(5) Food and agriculture: Surveys conducted last year showed that there were famines of varying degrees in various regions of China. It is estimated that there are 6 million residents in the famine and plague areas of Guangxi, and about 10 million in the famine and plague areas of Hunan. Although a bumper harvest is predicted, it can alleviate some of the famine. However, in the long term, the search for and purchase of large quantities of food imports will continue, and the only way to quickly solve the food shortage problem is to expand agricultural production. With the assistance of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, some progress has been made in the reclamation of flooded and abandoned farmland, as well as in the establishment of fisheries. (6) Industry and mining: Due to the war, the bombing of the occupied areas by the Allied forces, and the situation at the time of the takeover, it is estimated that China lost 90% of its original industrial machinery. It is reported that the only industries that can maintain 15% to 20% of their pre-war production are the steel and coal power industries. However, some recent signs have indicated a significant recovery in the coal mining sector.</p>
<p>Insufficient Transportation Reconstruction; Railway Materials Most Needed</p>
<p>(7) Transportation and traffic: The war has caused huge losses to China's railway vehicles. At the same time, reconstruction efforts are extremely insufficient. Currently, the most urgently needed are railway materials to restore railway traffic from Hangzhou to Quzhou and from Hengyang to Guilin. According to further estimates, even after the entire United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's railway plan is completed, it will continue to support China's various rehabilitation needs. It is estimated that imports of railway transportation to China will exceed US$40,000 within two years. During the war, China lost 30,000 tons of fishing boats, and more than half of the total tonnage of other ships was also lost. It is expected that 160 surplus ships from the United States, totaling 800,000 tons, will soon be transferred to China. Eventually, China's shipping tonnage will reach 1.5 million tons, which is temporarily sufficient for domestic navigation. However, to restore China's total commercial shipping needs, it will require US$300 million. A two-year highway restoration plan will require more than US$100 million, and the needs for telecommunications and air transport will reach US$50 million.</p>
<p>Imports Exceed Exports by More Than Four Times; Low Salaries for Civil Servants</p>
<p>Regarding the payment of foreign trade, China's import rate appears to be more than four times its export rate. The most recent import and export figures for the first eleven months of 1945 show that imports exceeded exports by US$450 million. Calculated at the official exchange rate, imports from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are not included, and these imports can increase this figure by 20%. The recovery of China's foreign trade after the war has been "disappointing" due to the unsound state of production and transportation, and the excessively high prices of export goods due to inflation. A serious consequence of fiscal inflation is the low salaries of civil servants. China is facing a major problem of balancing its international payments. However, food, resources, foreign assets, and enemy property can still be used to alleviate the problem. The fundamental problem is the imbalance in the national budget.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Politics More Important Than Economics</h3>
<p>The economic crisis caused by the gold rush has now led to the adoption of an economic emergency measures plan by the Supreme National Defense Council. The government will vigorously implement ten emergency measures. Given this spirit and determination to deal with the current economic crisis, as long as it can be thoroughly and earnestly implemented, overcoming the current economic difficulties should be no problem sooner or later. The people of the whole country, who have not seen stable governance since the war, naturally place deep expectations on the adoption of this decision. They feel that the difficulties in their lives are mainly due to the constant fluctuations in prices. Under the current situation in our country, even if they do not harbor extravagant hopes for lower prices, they still hope that general prices can stabilize so that they can have some respite. Originally, price fluctuations and the economic crisis caused by price fluctuations are economic phenomena. The changes in economic phenomena are governed by economic laws. Understanding and properly applying these economic laws may well overcome these economic difficulties and guide the national economy onto the right track. However, in our country, the current economic crisis seems to be caused more by political relations than by economic relations. Political factors played a role in creating the current economic crisis. Therefore, after the government has come up with emergency measures to deal with the current economic crisis, we must point out that the importance of political measures to resolve our economic crisis is no less than that of economic measures. In a sense, political measures may be even more important than economic measures: this is what is meant by politics being more important than economics.</p>
<p>In terms of politics, there are at least three aspects to dealing with and resolving the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>First, when we read Chairman Chiang's remarks after the economic emergency measures plan was passed, we can clearly understand that the current economic crisis in our country is mainly caused by the Communist Party's disregard for national interests and deliberate sabotage. "From the above, we must be able to deeply understand that the current economic difficulties are actually due to the destruction suffered in the eight years of the War of Resistance and the disruption of the country and the destruction of peace by the Communist Party in the past year." It can be seen that our wise chairman has explained to us the main causes of the current economic difficulties without reservation. This newspaper has repeatedly discussed and elaborated on this point. The Communist Party's armed rebellion and sabotage of transportation have prevented the national economy from recovering, and they have stirred up trouble and disrupted finance. All these facts should be known to the people of the country. As long as the Communist Party's rebellion does not stop for a day, the national economic crisis cannot be resolved for a day. Even if the government has economic magic strategies, if the Communist Party problem is not resolved for a day, this magic strategy will inevitably be attacked. After the war, the most urgent measure for the government to take to save the national economy is to reorganize the currency system. The reason why the currency system has not been reorganized is because of the Communist Party's sabotage. To resolve our economic crisis, we must first resolve the Communist Party problem.</p>
<p>Second, the ten emergency measures formulated by the government are good in law and intention, and are an appropriate measure. However, due to the accumulated malpractices in politics over the years, even if the government has good laws and well-intentioned policies, they often lose their original meaning during implementation and become a pie in the sky. The painful experiences of wartime are still fresh in our minds. Therefore, these emergency measures must not fail again, only success is allowed. To ensure the success of these measures, we must strengthen administrative efficiency, which in the negative aspect is to prevent the recurrence of malpractices. Our national economy has reached a critical juncture, and we must not allow the people's lives, which are already in dire straits, to be hit again. Therefore, these emergency measures must be implemented earnestly and strictly assessed. Those who engage in corruption and fraud must be punished with the penalties they deserve. This is also a political issue, an issue of how to maintain political discipline and administrative efficiency. For this problem, there is nothing more than diligent assessment, clear rewards and punishments, and a clear distinction between right and wrong must be made. It is essential not to confuse black and white, so as not to discourage the generally loyal and self-respecting people, and even cause them to follow the crowd. The plan is important, but the most important thing is whether the implementation fully conforms to the original intention of deciding on this plan.</p>
<p>Third, the gold market craze has now passed, but the people have suffered enormous damage. Although the causes of this craze are not simple, the authorities in charge of finance and economy have failed to prevent it beforehand and have failed to respond properly after it occurred. It is difficult to shirk the blame for mistakes and dereliction of duty. Yesterday, the National Assembly representatives and senators staying in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Chairman, suggesting seven items, including this point: "Investigate the responsibilities of the highest responsible persons for financial and economic policy failures, rectify discipline, and restore public confidence." We feel that this point really needs to be considered and adopted. This is another political measure, but it is related to the future of our national economy. If the responsibilities of the highest responsible persons for financial and economic policy failures are not investigated, how can the government claim to maintain political discipline and strengthen administrative efficiency to the people who have suffered enormous damage?</p>
<p>In short, the current economic crisis in our country is not just an economic problem, but also a political problem. We must start from both economic and political aspects before there is hope for a solution. The ten emergency measures adopted by the government are appropriate measures, but we hope that there will also be parallel political measures at the same time, so that we can resolve the current crisis.</p>

<h3>Strategic Islands in the Pacific; US Requests Exclusive Trusteeship; Formally Submits Draft Agreement to the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] Disregarding the advice of Britain and the Soviet Union, the United States today requested the United Nations Security Council to place the Pacific islands formerly under Japanese control under US trusteeship. According to US sources last night, a draft trusteeship agreement for the strategic locations of the Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, and Caroline Islands will be submitted to the United Nations today, requesting that it be included in the current agenda. However, according to the most reliable sources, if Britain and the Soviet Union insist that this matter should not be discussed temporarily and should be decided after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, then the United States may also agree to postpone the discussion indefinitely. US officials here have received instructions to fully explain the US proposal for exclusive trusteeship of the islands when the Security Council meets today.</p>
<p>President Truman publicly stated in November of last year the conditions under which the United States would seek exclusive defense of the Pacific islands. At the same time, the United States believes that the relevant governments have also requested them to express their opinions on this US proposal. Both Britain and the Soviet Union subsequently notified the US State Department that they believed this matter should wait until after negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty. Australia also submitted a similar advisory note to the United States, pointing out that Australia would welcome the US trusteeship of these islands when the appropriate time comes. The contents of the British and Soviet notes have not been made public by the US, but it is heard that neither country has raised any detailed objections to the US proposal. Officials in Washington frankly admit that the US Army and Navy are determined to place this strategically important area under absolute US control, even if the Security Council opposes this trusteeship plan. They stated that the United States has no intention of accepting any changes to the main principles of this proposal.</p>
<p>The US prefers to submit this issue directly to the Security Council for handling rather than submitting it to the Trusteeship Committee or the United Nations General Assembly, because what the US is requesting is the trusteeship of a strategic area where foreigners are not allowed to enter in part or in whole, and where any naval, land, and air military bases and fortresses needed by the US will be constructed. According to the United Nations Charter, strategic trusteeship proposals are directly under the jurisdiction of the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Ask the United Nations to Convene an Emergency Meeting to Handle the Palestine Issue; The Security Council Launches Atomic Warfare Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] The British government may request the United Nations General Assembly to convene an emergency meeting to handle the Palestine issue. British officials have decided to bypass the Security Council and submit the case directly to the United Nations General Assembly or the Trusteeship Council. The British Labour government firmly believes that the seriousness of the situation in Palestine warrants the immediate convening of a special meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. However, it is not yet certain whether other countries will agree. The next regular session of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in New York in October. The members of the General Assembly believe that the Palestine dispute cannot be submitted to the Trusteeship Council before it has been addressed by the General Assembly. The first meeting of the Trusteeship Council is scheduled to be held on the 26th of next month to handle the issues of various trusteeship territories, and Palestine is one of the issues.</p>
<p>As for the Security Council, its current agenda is already entangled and unclear. Britain is happy to no longer submit another entangled Palestine issue to it. The debate on the issue of atomic energy control will resume in the Security Council on Tuesday. It is said that the Soviet representative will present his original ten control proposals at that time, and Britain will re-submit its long-delayed Albania issue on Wednesday. The Security Council is also prepared to accept the Albania issue. Albanian representative Kapo arrived here on Saturday to prepare a reply to Britain's accusation that it laid mines in the Corfu Strait, endangering forty-four British sailors.</p>
<h3>Izvestia Accuses US of Anti-Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 16th] The Izvestia newspaper carried a report today stating that the US Republican Party is prepared to unite with Britain to carry out a "military attack" on the Soviet Union. The newspaper accused US political commentator Dulles of making remarks on the eve of the four foreign ministers' conference to undermine US-Soviet negotiations. Since the Republican Party gained a majority in Congress last autumn, this attack by Izvestia is the most intense. It is claimed that Dulles and other Republican leaders have engaged in undermining peace, and the reason for their anti-Soviet movement is that the Soviet Union has recently "proven in United Nations meetings that the United States is an imperialist armed country." Dulles's speech in New York on January 17 was actually a response to Churchill's request for British-American cooperation, and his words were tantamount to saying, "Mr. Churchill, we Republicans are prepared to accelerate uniting with Britain to carry out a military offensive against the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>US Disarmament: Three Major Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Nimitz Delivers Speech</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] US Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz said in a speech at a university today, "The US can only reduce its military strength after three prerequisites have been met: (1) the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty to eliminate the causes of future wars; (2) there must be reliable guarantees, including a monitoring system; (3) there must be reasonable assurance that the United Nations organization is a truly effective organization. If all countries can cooperate sincerely, another great war is not inevitable."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union to Build a Large Sluice Gate in Siberia</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 16th] Moscow Radio announced that the Soviet Union will build a sluice gate on the Angara River in central Siberia, with a power generation capacity equivalent to the Soviet Union's famous Dnieper River Sluice Gate.</p>
<h3>Franco Expresses Willingness to Step Down Voluntarily if Necessary</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Madrid, 16th] Franco recently told an American reporter that if he believes that his abandonment of power is necessary to save Spain, he would be happy to do so. Some quarters have accused us of assisting Germany during the war. In fact, our trade with Germany never reached pre-war levels. Before the Pearl Harbor incident, Britain and France had already declared war on the Axis powers, and it was well known that Japan would eventually participate in the war. However, the United States continued to ship arms and chemicals to Japan until a few weeks before the Pearl Harbor incident. This may have been a deceptive diplomatic tactic by the United States, but there is no reason why we cannot adopt the same tactic. As for the steps taken by the United Nations towards Spain, countries that have recalled their ambassadors to Spain should also recall their ambassadors to Poland, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, he said.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives to Be Dissolved at the End of the Month; Re-election to Be Held on April 25</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] The Japanese Cabinet decided today to dissolve the House of Representatives on the 28th of this month, and then hold another election on April 25, so that "national public opinion can be expressed in a democratic way" in accordance with MacArthur's instructions. The House of Councillors is scheduled to be elected on April 20 to replace the House of Peers, whose members were previously appointed by the Emperor. Municipal councils and village councils are scheduled to be elected on April 30, and local government officials are scheduled to be elected on April 5. Popular election of officials is an unprecedented event in Japanese history. The new constitution will be implemented on May 3 after the national and local elections are completed. MacArthur's headquarters said that it does not oppose the election dates decided by the Japanese cabinet.</p>
<p>Hirohito's Property Reaches 3 Billion Yen</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Emperor Hirohito and his family today completed the declaration of all their property in accordance with the new property tax law, totaling 3 billion yen. This property will be taxed by the government. Royal property is taxed the same as civilian property, which is an unprecedented event in Japanese history. The property tax paid by the royal family will account for 90% of its total property value, so the property that it can actually retain will be very little.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] There are currently 93,000 police officers in Japan. The Ministry of Home Affairs plans to increase the number to 130,000 starting in April to maintain law and order during chaotic times. During the war, the number of police officers in Japan was reduced from 90,000 to 70,000. After the surrender, the army was disbanded, and the number of police officers increased to the current number.</p>
<p>Japanese Buddhists Oppose the Communist Party</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th, United Press] The Tokyo Times claims that 5 million Japanese Buddhists are expected to launch a political offensive against the Communist Party during the election to be held in April because Buddhism has realized that the Communist Party is launching an anti-religious movement.</p>
<h3>On the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Yoshida Hopes for Speedy Convening</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Prime Minister Yoshida indicated today that he believes Japan will be able to have a representative attend the conference in which the Allied countries will finally decide on the contents of the Japanese peace treaty.

For the sake of Japan's revival, he hopes that the peace treaty conference can be held as soon as possible and that Japan can be granted permission to participate in international trade.</p>

<h3>Rumors that the US Agrees to Abolish the "Enemy Trade Agreement"</h3>
<p>Japanese Trade May Become More Active</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] An authoritative source here told a United Press reporter today that the "Enemy Trade Agreement" governing commerce between Japan and the US will be abolished within a month after Japan's surrender. However, this does not mean that private trade with Japan can be completely opened up. The control of the Allied Headquarters will continue to be maintained, and all import and export trade will temporarily be handled by the original agencies. It is said that at the beginning of January, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs inquired with the Allied Headquarters whether it agreed to cancel the trade agreement. The Headquarters immediately replied that it agreed. Since then, there have been various signs that the agreement can be abolished in three or four weeks.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: An earthquake occurred in the French port of Marseille this morning, lasting for three minutes, causing considerable damage to buildings, but no casualties.</p>
<p>[United Press, Marseille, 17th] It is estimated that the epicenter of the earthquake was about 90 miles outside of Marseille. There is an old volcanic area northeast of Marseille, so earthquakes are frequent, but such a severe earthquake along the Mediterranean coast is rare.</p>
<h3>India and France Exchange Ambassadors</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] It is officially announced here that India and France will exchange ambassadors.</p>
<h3>US Press Delegation Arrives in the Philippines for Inspection</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 17th] A nine-member US press delegation, led by Howard, publisher of the Howard newspaper chain, arrived here today to inspect US facilities in the Pacific. They flew to Baguio for inspection and returned here on the same day. Tomorrow, they will inspect the military facilities at Corregidor and are scheduled to depart for Guam on the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3>Who Will Be the Candidates in the Next US Presidential Election?</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington] Since the Republican Party gained control of both houses of Congress, the general trend has been to prevent the development of international economicism and focus attention on domestic labor-management relations, domestic markets, tax rates, veterans' benefits, and agricultural product prices. If this trend continues until 1948, the main tasks of the next US president will be: (1) to adopt a policy of reconciling US national interests with the world political system on issues such as protective tariffs and surplus agricultural products; (2) to balance the budget while further reducing taxes; (3) to establish a stable situation between organized labor rights and capitalists; (4) to expand the stability of agricultural product prices and control surplus agricultural product plans; and (5) to satisfy veterans' requests for assistance. Due to the Republican Party regaining control of both houses of Congress, the possibility of a Republican president being elected has greatly increased, and it is receiving attention. Historically, there are many precedents for a party that gains a majority in midterm elections to continue to hold power.</p>
<p>However, President Truman still maintains his leadership position within the Democratic Party, especially after Marshall expressed no other political ambitions. The new Secretary of State's goal is only to succeed within the cabinet and does not want to hinder Truman from becoming the presidential candidate in 1948.</p>
<p>As for the Republican Party, hoping to win in 1948, the most pressing question is: who can be elected?</p>
<p>This candidate should preferably be an efficient legislator and administrator rather than a reformer and idealist. Currently, New York Governor Dewey, Senator Vandenberg, and Taft are the most popular figures in the Republican Party. Others such as Senator Bricker, former Minnesota Governor Stassen, and California Governor Warren are also not without hope. If a political deadlock occurs at the Republican National Convention next year, it is not impossible for someone unexpected to be elected as a candidate. With Marshall not participating in the candidate race, the Republican Party is no longer discussing military figures such as MacArthur as candidates. Washington is rumored that New York Governor Dewey is the most promising Republican candidate. Senator Vandenberg, although popular, is in a very important political position as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and may take a backseat. Senator Taft also does not seem very concerned about the presidential candidacy because of his important position in the Republican-controlled Senate. Senator Bricker has also not adopted an active attitude towards the presidential candidacy. As for Stassen, he remains a mystery in American domestic politics. Some believe that Stassen's failure to run for senator last year was a mistake because once elected, he would have received attention. However, although Stassen does not currently hold public office, he is eager to try for the presidency in the future and has established his office in Washington. This is unprecedented in American history. Warren's election as Governor of California, supported by both the Republican and Democratic parties, and his reputation as an effective administrative expert, will make him a "dark horse" in 1948.</p>
<p>On the Democratic side, some speculate that current Secretary of Commerce Harriman may be the Democratic candidate in 1948. However, it is generally expected that he will only be a vice-presidential candidate. As for what Wallace's position will be in the future, it remains a subject of much debate. He is clearly no longer valued by the Democratic Party, but some political researchers believe that major changes in the international or economic situation may make it possible for him to become a progressive or third-party presidential candidate. However, such candidates may not receive many votes.</p>
<p>The Division of the American New Deal Faction</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington] The left wing and progressives of the American New Deal faction will need at least four years to recover from the successive blows of President Roosevelt's death and the Republican victory after the war. Some even say that the left wing and progressives will not be able to raise their heads until six or eight years later. Furthermore, within these factions, the issue of being pro-communist or not has made it impossible to concentrate their strength for the time being.</p>
<p>Among them, the leading figures of the left wing include former Secretary of Commerce Wallace, former UNRRA Director LaGuardia, former Assistant Secretary of State MacLeish, and former National Citizens Political Action Committee President Kintner. They advocate a more reasonable and friendly policy towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>New Deal figures with different views include Mrs. Roosevelt and her son, former Price Administrator Henderson, Bowles, and former War Information Bureau Director Davis. They advocate a clear demarcation between genuine progressivism and pro-communism, and they particularly approve of former Secretary of State Byrnes' policy towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The aforementioned two factions of New Deal figures have each established their own organizations. Wallace's group is called the "American Progressive Citizens Association," which is formed by combining the forces of the "Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions" and the "National Citizens Political Action Committee." It advocates expanding and continuing Roosevelt's New Deal domestic policies. In foreign policy, it advocates opposing fascism and imperialism and demands actively changing the State Department's current foreign policy. The opposing organization is called the "American Democratic Action Society," which was formed by Mrs. Roosevelt and several former government officials to counter the former two organizations that were accused of being communist. They advocate expanding and continuing the domestic policies of the late President Roosevelt and seem to approve of most of the State Department's foreign policy.</p>
<p>The number of left-wing members of American labor unions who support the former two factions is roughly equal. In addition to being divided over the communist issue, New Deal figures are also difficult to reconcile over the issue of whether to form a third party. Some advocate supporting any progressive figures in the two major parties, some advocate continuing to maintain ties with the Democratic Party, and some advocate directly establishing a third party. It is expected that within a few years, the first three opinions will not be able to reach an agreement.</p>

<h3>Mayor Convenes Meeting of Leaders from Various Industries; Minister Wang Invited to Attend and Express Government's Intentions; Elaborates on Key Points of Economic Plan; Expresses Deep Hope for People's Cooperation to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the central government announced the emergency economic measures plan, Mayor Wu convened leaders from the city's industrial and commercial sectors at the City Hall yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, and invited Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Wentao to participate, adjourning at 11:00 AM. Wang gave a detailed explanation of the economic measures that have been decided upon this time: regarding the implementation of price controls, he believed that it would only be effective if the people and the government had close cooperation. Regarding the balancing the budget item in this plan, the main focus is on reducing non-urgent expenditures and emphasizing private enterprises. State-owned enterprises already operated by the government, or state-owned enterprises that are about to be operated by the government, can be publicly sold to private ownership, with the intention of guiding floating capital to the right track.</p>
<p>Regarding suppressing speculation and stabilizing the financial market: Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles have two contradictions. On the one hand, there is a shortage of funds, and they request the government to handle industrial and commercial loans; on the other hand, there is a surplus of floating capital, and they compete to speculate in gold trading. The government, in view of the high domestic industrial costs, high wages, and difficulty in exporting domestic products, in order to compete for foreign markets, has introduced a 100% subsidy and a 50% import surcharge. Unexpectedly, after the implementation of this method, foreign goods skyrocketed, and domestic goods also rose accordingly, far exceeding 50%, the reason being that the people failed to cooperate with the government. This time, the decision to suppress gold speculation and prohibit the circulation of foreign currency is mainly intended to stabilize prices. Furthermore, increasing foreign exchange is also intended to encourage exports. The government is now preparing to use US$200 million for the normal import of industrial products. However, the government hopes that after this time, the limited foreign exchange will be controlled, and that the people of the whole country will develop the habit of using domestic goods.</p>
<p>Regarding wages being based on the January index as the highest point, it is deeply hoped that the labor community will appreciate the government's sincerity and work hard on their own. At the same time, under the principle of taking care of the lives of workers, the government will implement universal distribution of food, cloth, and fuel. As for price controls and the supply of daily necessities, the government has decided to strictly implement them according to the "Regulations for the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry and Commerce During Extraordinary Times" and the "Regulations for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiations". At the same time, it is also hoped that leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors will cooperate with the government, each with patriotic enthusiasm, to support each other through difficulties and overcome the difficulties together.</p>
<p>Next, Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the City General Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, saying that what he wanted to say was that after the foreign exchange, gold, and US dollar issues were resolved, the price issue still could not be resolved. At the same time, he hoped that the government would not harass legitimate merchants when thoroughly investigating gold and US dollar speculation incidents.</p>
<p>Mayor Puts Forward Two Points</p>
<p>Finally, the Mayor delivered a speech: he said that recently the price fluctuations in this city have been very severe, as the City General Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xu and Director Luo said at the City Hall's price discussion meeting some days ago, although the prices of various items have risen in a straight line, very few goods have been traded, indicating that price fluctuations are unfavorable to all industries. He would like to put forward two points for discussion with everyone: (1) Some days ago, the black market price of gold in this city rose to 9.7 million yuan, and the black market price of US dollars rose to 21,000 yuan. Now, the central bank has regulations for the price of gold, and the government has also stipulated the price of US dollars as 12,000 yuan in national currency equivalent to one US dollar. Gold and US dollars have both seen a decline in price, and the prices of various items should fall in proportion, and should never rise again. (2) The laws and regulations set by the government are very strict, but he is concerned that in the future, social capital will once again be transferred to hoarding goods. He deeply hopes that everyone will tell each industry not to hoard for profit, especially daily necessities related to people's livelihoods, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and food. Regarding economic measures, the government does not want to use political pressure, and hopes that each industry will cooperate with the government and work together to overcome difficulties. If there are any difficulties, the government will be responsible for finding ways to solve them. Regarding the detailed methods for stabilizing prices and suppressing prices, please ask the City General Chamber of Commerce to convene a detailed discussion with the industry associations of each industry in the city tomorrow. It would be even better if Minister Wang could participate, and he will definitely participate at that time.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Convenes Price Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The City General Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to hold a price conference at 3:00 PM today in the standing committee room of the Chamber.

Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu and Mayor Wu Guozhen will both be invited to attend.</p>

<h3>Three Arrested for Selling US Dollars Privately</h3>
<p>To Be Sentenced to Up to Five Years in Prison</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the resolution to prohibit the free trading of gold and US dollars was passed by the Supreme National Defense Council, this city began to implement it yesterday, sending police to strictly investigate throughout the city. Yesterday, most silver shops and money shops stopped operating, but some scalpers who specialize in buying and selling gold and US dollars still dared to break the law. Yesterday morning, the First Inspection Brigade of the Inspection Department patrolled to Sichuan Road and discovered Xu Jinfa, Song Ziming, and Zhang Chiheng violating the law and selling US dollars privately. They were immediately arrested, and 100 US dollars were found in Xu Jinfa's bag, 50 US dollars were found in Song Zi's bag, and Zhang Chiheng was the middleman who introduced the transaction.

<h3>President Song Supervises the Implementation of the Plan; Listens to Reports from All Sides All Day</h3>
<p>Since the central government promulgated the emergency economic measures plan, President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday and went to the Bank of China Building yesterday morning at 8:00 AM to supervise the implementation of the plan and listen to reports from all sides. Wang Yunwu and Wu Guozhen went to pay their respects, reporting on the process of convening the leaders of various industries at the City Hall that day, explaining the outline of the government's plan, and the main purpose of stabilizing the people's livelihood.

<h3>Director Zhou's Earnest Solicitation; Firefighters Dismiss the Idea of Resignation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After being stimulated by the Westmoreland Road fire case, all 514 firefighters in the city's fire department recently submitted their resignations. However, Director Zhou did not approve them and made an earnest exhortation to all firefighters at the memorial week meeting yesterday. Unexpectedly, the firefighters' intention to resign was firm, and they unanimously refused to attend the memorial week meeting yesterday morning. Director Zhou, considering the seriousness of the situation, in order to avoid escalation, ordered two long-time police officers from each district sub-team to be selected and held a temporary meeting at the Central District Team at 2:00 PM yesterday. Director Zhou earnestly advised them to work with peace of mind, not to be afraid of hard work, and to serve the society with a consistent spirit, and not to be concerned about external criticism. If anyone has concrete opinions or reasonable demands regarding the current fire administration, they can submit them in writing, but they must not take any out-of-line actions. After listening to the speech, the representatives expressed their willingness to accept it and are currently considering offering concrete opinions.</p>
<p>In addition, since the Xiku Road fire case occurred, Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang and three section chiefs had unanimously resigned to take responsibility, but after the authorities appeased them, their intention to resign has also been dismissed.</p>
<h3>Gu Chunfan Transferred to Head of Savings and Remittance Bureau; When He Will Go to Nanjing Is Still Uncertain</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, was recently transferred to be the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau. When the reporter visited yesterday, he was told that he had gone to Nanjing last time to decline the position of Director of the Savings and Remittances Bureau, but it was not approved. Now, everything is still pending discussion with Mayor Wu, and when he will go to Nanjing is still uncertain. The rumor that he left Shanghai last night is not accurate. It is feared that it will have to wait until the City Council meeting is held and this year's budget is finalized. Mayor Wu also has this intention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that after Gu's departure, there will be no changes in personnel at the Finance Bureau, only He Jiayu, Chief of the Housing Tax Section, Han Xiaochi, Chief of the Audit Section, and Fang Tinghua, Secretary, who were originally borrowed from the Postal Bureau, may still return to the Postal Bureau this time.</p>
<h3>Good News for Traitors: "Lack of Talent," "Should Give Jobs"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] In light of the current talent shortage, the Municipal Higher Court believes that traitors sentenced to imprisonment who possess specialized skills should not be buried. They should be given work opportunities to utilize their strengths and atone for their crimes through meritorious service. Based on the "Parole" and "Service Outside Prison" regulations, the court has recently issued a single list requiring sentenced traitors to fill out their special skills, such as proficiency in foreign languages, writing, translation, and other talents. The court will review these forms, conduct individual assessments, and submit them to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Tool of the Puppet Regime, "China Film" General Manager Feng Jie's Trial Concludes; Also Claims to Have Received Secret Orders from the Central Government</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Feng Jie, accused of being a traitor, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. Feng Jie, styled Jieru, is from Shunde, Guangdong, and is 44 years old. In 1940, he served as the education director of the Propaganda Training Institute of the puppet Propaganda Department. In 1941, he also served as a standing committee member of the puppet Relief Committee. In June 1943, he was elected as an alternate central committee member of the puppet regime and served as the deputy minister of the puppet Propaganda Department. He then became the director of the Shanghai Office of the puppet Propaganda Department, the general manager and executive director of the puppet China Film Company, and other positions. Anti-British and anti-American films such as "Regrets of Spring River" and "Ten Thousand Generations of Glory" were produced under Feng's supervision during his tenure as general manager of "China Film." Feng, who appeared thin, testified in court yesterday that he had received secret orders from the Central Government in 1939 to engage in intelligence work within the puppet regime. After 1940, he used his puppet positions to cover his work and presented several pieces of evidence. After a lengthy hearing, the court announced the conclusion of the case and scheduled the verdict for the morning of the 24th.</p>
<h3>Sun Biwei's Traitor Suspicions; Yan Huiqing Called to Testify</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Sun Biwei, accused of being a traitor, is the cousin of Sun Zhongli, a prominent businessman during the enemy occupation. He served as the deputy manager of Zhongfu Bank. The High Court held its first hearing yesterday. The defendant was tall and wore black riding breeches, a wool overcoat, and a gray-blue woolen scarf. The court asked: "Is it true that Sun Zhongli has gone to the United States?" The defendant replied: "I have not met Sun Zhongli for a long time and do not know where he is now." He flatly denied the accusations in the indictment that he helped Sun Zhongli purchase wheat and grains, providing resources to the enemy, and that he used bank funds for speculation. Yan Huiqing was then called to testify, stating that the defendant had not engaged in any activities on behalf of the enemy or puppet regime. Finally, attorney Duan Benkai presented documents favorable to the defendant. The court ordered the defendant to post a cash bail of 10 million yuan and provide a guarantee from a substantial business establishment, pending further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Under the Supervision of the Supervisory Group, Merchants Dare Not Act Recklessly</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Economic Supervisory Group officially began its work yesterday. After meeting yesterday morning to discuss the implementation steps and various technical matters requiring attention, the responsible personnel of the group began their work separately. The Gold and Currency Group continued to investigate the gold trading accounts of various banks and gold shops and illegal acceptance of gold mortgages, confirming that the Central Bank had sold a total of over 16,000 gold bars since the 13th of this month. The investigation of other banks and gold shops could not be completed in a day or two, so no results had been announced as of yesterday. Reports that the authorities had submitted a blacklist of over 100 people suspected of manipulating speculation to Chairman Chiang were inaccurate. According to the person in charge of the group yesterday, the blacklist has not yet been finalized as the investigation is still ongoing. The Food Group dispatched personnel throughout the day to monitor transactions in the North and South Rice Markets and implement the policy of requiring rice prices to fall by 4,000-5,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight) each day. Therefore, the situation in the rice market yesterday was very good, with white japonica rice falling back to 115,000 yuan per dan. The Yarn and Cloth Group, fearing that speculative funds would shift in this direction after the ban on gold and currency trading, closely monitored the market. Merchants did not dare to act recklessly, and yarn prices also fell slightly. Today, personnel from each group will continue to investigate accounts and monitor the market, and rice and yarn prices are expected to continue to fall.</p>
<h3>American Giant Aircraft Arrives Today; Carrying Madam Zhu Shiming</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The second DC-4 giant aircraft of Northwest Airlines, conducting a test flight on the North Pacific route, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon today. The aircraft is carrying the company's general manager, Hunter, several directors, and the wife of General Zhu Shiming, the head of the Chinese Military Mission to Japan.</p>
<h3>Compensation for War of Resistance Losses Should Await Unified Planning; Executive Yuan Denies Municipal Government's Request</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Municipal Government requested instructions from the Central Government, citing a resolution passed at the first meeting of the Municipal Council, requesting that the government advance the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet properties confiscated in Shanghai to compensate the people of the city for the losses suffered during the War of Resistance. It is learned that the Municipal Government has now received a letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan stating: "It is not appropriate to use the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet properties in a certain area as compensation for the war losses in that area. All proceeds from the aforementioned sales should be submitted to the National Treasury in full. How to allocate funds for loss compensation in the future should await unified planning by the Central Government. The Shanghai Municipal Council's request to advance the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet properties confiscated in Shanghai to compensate the people of the city for their losses is difficult to approve."</p>
<p>However, the Municipal Government believes that the second meeting of the Municipal Council also made similar recommendations, which are related to public opinion, and will resubmit the matter to the Central Government for review.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony of the Laozha Volunteer Police</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Laozha Brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Volunteer Police Corps held a graduation ceremony for 200 new police officers at the Police Club on Shaoxing Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Team Leader Xuan delivered a speech, followed by a dinner and photo session at 6:00 PM, with entertainment afterwards.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Prices Will Increase Again; Application Submitted to the Government for Approval</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] After the National Defense Supreme Council approved the revision of the exchange rate to 12,000 yuan per US dollar, gasoline prices in the market will increase again in the coming days. According to reliable sources, various gasoline companies in the city have requested government approval to increase prices yesterday. The amount of the proposed increase has not been disclosed by the companies. It is only known that the increase will not be proportional to the change in the exchange rate. In other words, the gasoline price increase will not be more than three times the exchange rate. The rationing system, prepared to prevent hoarding and congestion at gas stations, has already begun, with car owners receiving application forms to be submitted to the companies by the 22nd of this month. However, a person in charge of a certain company said yesterday that if the rush to purchase gasoline disappears after the price increase, the rationing system may not be necessary, as the company finds this system quite troublesome. The reason for adopting it this time is following the recommendation of the Public Utilities Bureau.</p>
<h3>Former Concubine of Traitor Recognized as Foster Mother; A Puppet Official Awaits Sentencing</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Chen Mingde, 31 years old from Fuzhou, accused of being a traitor, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. The defendant had a hometown friendship with the traitor Chen Qun and served as Chen's personal secretary. He also became acquainted with Chen's concubine, Luo Wenru, and recognized Luo as his foster mother. During the puppet Provisional Government, the defendant served as a staff member of the General Affairs Department of the puppet Ministry of Interior, director of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Youth Corps, and secretary of the puppet Control Yuan. After a hearing, the court announced the conclusion of the case and scheduled the verdict for the morning of the 24th.</p>
<h3>Shao Youren Declared Not Guilty; Xu Zigeng Sentenced to Two Years</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Shao Youren was reported for demolishing the China Merchants Bureau Wharf during the occupation of Shanghai. After the High Court inquired with the Police Bureau and the China Merchants Bureau, it was reported that the facts were not true and there was no supporting evidence. The case was announced in the High Court yesterday: Shao Youren is not guilty. Also, Xu Zigeng, accused of being a traitor, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for two years by the High Court yesterday morning. His property will be confiscated according to law.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Hearing of Car Repair Corruption Case; Collusion to Issue False Invoices; All Suspected of Corruption</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Last summer, when the Investigation Group came to Shanghai, the corruption case of the Municipal Government's automobile receivership, which was first discovered and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, was investigated by Prosecutor Cao Hong of the District Prosecutor's Office. Based on the list of vehicles transferred by Shen Zhenjia, the former head of the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, to Chen Wusong, and the original list of vehicles received by the Municipal Government, the condition of the vehicles was clearly stated. Among them, three Chevrolet trucks received from the puppet Air Defense Headquarters were produced in 1940 and had completely new components. However, Feng Peifang of Wan Tai Motor Company issued repair invoices for these three vehicles, totaling 4,955,000 yuan. In addition, three Ford sedans were property of the traitor Wang Jingwei, with only the batteries damaged. However, Chen Wusong's report stated that they were dilapidated and unusable. Using this kind of fraudulent method, it was confirmed that 16 intact vehicles were not actually repaired, and Chen Wusong colluded with Wan Tai Motor Company to issue repair invoices, defrauding more than 40 million yuan. Therefore, the two defendants were suspected of violating Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 3, Clause 6, and Article 5 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption and were prosecuted according to law.</p>
<p>Chen Wusong Claims: Never Profited</p>
<p>The case was preliminarily heard at the District Court at 3:00 PM yesterday. Shi Bangrui, the former director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, and Shen Zhenjia, the former head of the Vehicle Affairs Department, did not appear in court. Presiding Judge Meng Tingke signed for the defendants, Chen Wusong, the former head of the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, and Feng Peifang, the manager of Wan Tai Motor Repair Shop, to be brought to court. According to Chen, all received vehicles were first appraised, rated, and a vehicle score table was compiled. Vehicles with a score of 60 or more could be used, and vehicles with a score of less than 60 had a separate damage report prepared and submitted for approval before ordering repairs from the repair shop. The procedures were complicated, and corruption was impossible. He also claimed that he never profited from it. Regarding the repair of new cars, Chen argued that new cars left unused for a long time would have rusty parts that needed to be replaced, which should not be regarded as evidence of corruption. He also said that after Mayor Wu took office, he sent Yang Ke to Wan Tai Motor Company three times in June of last year to repair cars, which proves that there was no corruption in Wan Tai's repairs.</p>
<p>Feng Peifang Claims: Very Low Profit Margin</p>
<p>The second defendant, Feng Peifang, claimed that he was a legitimate businessman who had been engaged in the automobile business for decades. He accepted the business from the Municipal Government to establish credit, so the profit margin he took was particularly low. Moreover, the repair of Municipal Government cars was carried out on-site in the Municipal Government parking lot. After the repairs were completed, the Municipal Government had to send someone to inspect and accept them. There was no case of issuing false invoices and colluding for fraud. The defense lawyers for both defendants applied for bail, but the court rejected the application and ordered them to be detained, pending further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Notorious Night Thief in Pudong Arrested; Possesses Over a Thousand Gang Members, Specializing in Stealing Warehouse Goods; Four-Time Thief of Tobacco Factory Also Detained</h3>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Inquiries</h3>
<p>(1) Inheritance and Gift</p>
<p>Xu Lidong asks: I have several legal questions; please advise: (1) Is property given to children during one's lifetime considered part of the estate? (2) If the transfer of ownership of said property was not immediately completed upon allocation, is it still considered part of the estate?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] Allocation during one's lifetime constitutes a gift. The allocated property has already been transferred to the recipient due to the gift. Failure to complete the transfer of ownership does not invalidate the gift. Therefore, (1) property allocated five years ago should not be included in the estate; (2) since it was allocated during one's lifetime and management has been transferred, it cannot be treated the same as property that has not been allocated.</p>
<p>(2) Marital Relationship</p>
<p>Chen Ying asks: (1) Does the marital relationship still exist after the husband's death? (2) Is it a crime if either spouse intentionally makes things difficult? (3) Can either spouse dissolve the marriage without the other's consent? (4) After a divorce, does the dowry belong to the wife's family and can they reclaim it? If the husband's family refuses, is it considered embezzlement?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) Spouses have mutual obligations to cohabitate and mutual rights to inherit property. Upon the husband's death, the wife's obligation to cohabitate ceases, but the inheritance of the estate begins. Therefore, it cannot be said that all legal relationships have been extinguished. (2) A lack of a quick reply cannot be considered a crime. (3) Separation of family members requires a request. If one remarries, the relationship is naturally dissolved. (4) The dowry is the wife's private property. The husband's family has no right to retain it. However, if they only oppose the separation and prevent its removal, without intending to misappropriate it, it cannot be considered a crime.</p>
<h3>Talent Wanted</h3>
<p>We are now seeking the following talent: (1) A certain clinic is seeking one male pharmacist. Must be qualified with skills in preparing traditional Chinese medicine pills and powders. Salary: 200,000 yuan per month. (2) A certain school in Guangxi is seeking one high school English and one mathematics teacher. Gender is not restricted.

<h3>British Council Representative to China, Professor Joseph Needham, Passed Away Yesterday; Sino-British Association Cancels Dinner in Mourning</h3>
<p>Professor Joseph Needham, the British Council Representative to China, suddenly passed away in Nanjing yesterday (the 17th) morning. Professor Needham actively promoted Chinese education during his lifetime, and he had many Chinese and foreign friends in China. The sudden news of his death has caused deep sorrow. Professor Needham was born in 1880 and studied at Oundle School and Cambridge University. While studying modern history at Cambridge, he won the Gladstone Memorial Prize. From 1917 to 1944, Professor Needham served as a professor of geography at the University of Liverpool.</p>
<p>First Visit to China</p>
<p>Professor Needham first came to China in 1913 while traveling the world on the Albert Kahn Traveling Fellowship. This fellowship was established by the famous French banker Albert Kahn to encourage university students to acquire knowledge of foreign cultures in order to promote international understanding. In the autumn of 1921, Professor Needham returned to China as a member of the Christian Education Committee to coordinate the work between church universities and middle schools, as well as between church schools and the government education system. At that time, Professor Needham and others traveled throughout North and Central China under the leadership of the former President of Yenching University, now the U.S. Ambassador, Dr. John Leighton Stuart.</p>
<p>Second Attendance</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1931, Professor Needham attended the Pacific Science Congress in Shanghai and Hankou, again as a representative of the British delegation. In addition, he also represented the Universities' China Committee in London, giving lectures in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Peiping. When in England, Professor Needham maintained close contact with students studying in England. Since the establishment of the Universities' China Committee, he has been a member and often served on the executive committee.</p>
<p>Stationed in Chongqing</p>
<p>In May 1945, Professor Needham and his wife came to Chongqing to serve as the British Council Representative to China. His wife was also a member of the Council's history lecture team, having previously worked in the history department at the University of Liverpool for many years. Last autumn, Professor and Mrs. Needham began visiting Shanghai, giving academic lectures at several schools and educational institutions in Shanghai. Professor Needham also gave speeches at the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, the Shanghai British Club, and broadcast on international radio once.</p>
<p>Activities in China</p>
<p>Professor Needham has always been active in China to promote close cultural exchange between China and Britain, thereby working for the British Council to promote friendship between China and Britain without political or commercial goals; he also closely cooperated with the Sino-British Science Co-operation Office. The Sino-British Science Co-operation Office is now incorporated into the British Council's science department, with its headquarters in Nanjing. Professor Needham has written extensively on Chinese history and geography, including the China section in the 14th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica and a booklet on "China" for the Oxford University Press. Professor Needham's death is a loss to the Chinese cultural and educational circles, as he devoted his life to promoting and consolidating Sino-British friendship and understanding.

<h3>National Higher Normal Education; Recent Statistics from the Ministry of Education; There Are Nine National Normal Colleges</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] National higher normal education, according to recent statistics from the Ministry of Education, is as follows: In 1938, the Ministry of Education established the system of normal colleges. Colleges should be established independently or within universities. Some educational colleges were converted into normal colleges. In 1940, a women's normal college was established. All colleges have a five-year course of study, but the affiliated specialized courses have a three-year course of study. Normal colleges have affiliated primary and secondary schools for student teaching, and may establish a second department to recruit graduates from other university departments with similar characteristics, providing them with one year of professional training. Normal colleges may also have the following departments: (1) A junior department that enrolls high school or equivalent graduates for a three-year course of study; (2) A normal research institute for two years of research, awarding a master's degree in education; (3) A high school teacher in-service training class, studying for one year; (4) A junior high school teacher in-service training class, studying for one year; (5) A primary school teacher in-service training class, with a duration of one year. According to the investigation and statistics, there are nine national independent normal colleges: (1) Hunan, (2) Chongqing (Women's Normal College), (3) Guiyang (in Guizhou), (4) Hubei, (5) Guilin (in Du Xi), (6) Kunming, (7) Peiping, (8) Northwest (in Lanzhou) (9) Changbai (in Yongji).

According to the investigation, the total number of normal students in normal colleges and specialized schools is no more than 10,000, but the number of secondary schools is increasing, and the shortage of teachers is increasing. In order to remedy this situation, the Ministry of Education stipulates that universities that have not established normal colleges can also establish education departments in the liberal arts to allow students in arts and sciences colleges to select 22 credits of education courses in the education department to obtain secondary school teacher qualifications; universities that have established agricultural and engineering colleges can also use this method to train vocational school teachers.</p>

On that day, representatives from the Supervisory Yuan, the Shanghai Audit Office of the Ministry of Audit, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Government Accounting Office were present to supervise the opening of bids, and representatives selected by the Municipal Primary School Principals' Association and the Municipal Primary School Faculty and Staff Association were invited to attend. The contractors who won the bids that day were also jointly decided upon by the representatives of the various agencies and organizations. The allegations made by the carpentry shop to the Municipal Council on the 16th of this month are obviously fabricated, and we hereby request that you make a correction.

<h3>Ministry of Education Specifically Sets Aside a Room for Education Committee Members to Work; Full-Time Members Cheng Qibao and Others Come to the Ministry Every Day</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Education has hired more than ten people, including former or current university presidents, senior education administrators, and education experts, to serve as members of the Education Research Committee. These members are divided into full-time and part-time, and they are all advisors. All important educational issues are consulted or submitted for research in order to achieve perfect solutions. Previously, only a few full-time members, such as Tang Guhe, worked in the Ministry every day, and the rest were mostly mobile, mostly going out to inspect educational work. Now the Ministry of Education has specifically set aside a room for education committee members to work on a regular basis. In addition to part-time members who often come and go, full-time members Cheng Qibao, Tang Jihe, Cheng Shijun, Wang Maozu and others all come to the Ministry to work every day. The foreign member is currently Mr. John Leighton Stuart. It is also heard that in order to develop research work and communicate Chinese and foreign cultures, the Ministry of Education will still need to hire British and American education experts in the near future to join as members of the Education Research Committee.</p>
<h3>American Education Circles Actively Promote "Progressive Education"</h3>
<p>—Jin</p>
<p>Extracting Living Teaching Materials from Real Life; Not Rigidly Teaching Students from Dead Textbooks</p>
<p>American education circles are vigorously promoting the system of "progressive education." This system abolishes the rigid educational methods of the academic school and adopts teaching materials related to real life. Many middle schools in the United States have widely adopted this system.</p>
<p>Professor Kilpatrick of Columbia University in the United States, in the May 1946 issue of the "Progressive Education" publication, made the following explanation of the differences between "progressive education" and traditional education: Traditional educational methods are rigidly teaching students only the dead knowledge in textbooks, while "progressive education" extracts living teaching materials from real life. Students can not only gain fresh and rich knowledge from it, but also develop many kinds of talents.</p>
<p>Mann (1796-1859) and Dewey (1859-) made great contributions to the principles of American education. Mann was the Director of the Massachusetts Education Bureau. He improved school facilities in the state, raised educational standards, and improved teacher compensation. Later, he served as the president of Antioch College, which implemented a system of alternating reading and work (two students do one job together, taking turns working so that both have time to read). Dewey was a professor of philosophy at Columbia University. He worked hard to promote the acquisition of teaching materials from experience and reality. Many of his writings on education have been warmly welcomed in the United States and other countries, and have been selected as teaching materials for textbooks.</p>
<p>The following pictures show the implementation of "progressive education" in some public schools in the United States:</p>
<p>[Picture 1] At the "Demonstration School" affiliated with the University of Wisconsin under the "progressive education" system in the United States, sound movies are used to teach students.</p>
<p>[Picture 2] The Sands Hill Elementary School in Georgia is the "Educational Experiment Room" affiliated with the University of Georgia. The school implements the "progressive education" system. The picture shows first graders listening to folk songs with a wireless phonograph.</p>

<h3>Sunday First Division Football Match; Donghua Will Face the Soviet Union; Youth Cup Championship Decided on Thursday</h3>
<p>The Football Committee issued Notice No. 19 yesterday, stating: In addition to warning and punishing players who violate sportsmanship, which has been announced in the newspapers, this week's schedule has also been arranged and announced. This Thursday at 3:00 PM, the Youth Cup final, Qingbai B will face the Railway at the Yiguo Stadium. From 10:00 AM on the weekend, there will be a total of five Mayor's Cup First and Third Division finals, which will be played at the Yiyuan and Zhongzheng Park stadiums respectively.</p>
<p>In the Youth Cup final, Qingbai B will face the Railway. Qingbai B has many famous players, such as Huang Shijie, Huang Zhendong, Zhang Fenggang, and Jing Linggui, so their strength is very strong, while the Railway also has many capable players, such as Lu Qingxiang, Xiao Ziwen, Wu Binghao, Qu Xigen, and Zhang Qichang, so their combat effectiveness is quite strong. Once they meet, it is difficult to predict who will win.</p>
<p>In the First Division, Donghua will face the Soviet Union. Both sides have been resting for a long time. Under the current situation of conserving energy, they will meet at the time and must do their best. In order to maintain the honor of the ever-victorious army, Donghua will send its elite to the stage, while the Soviet Union will also send its brave generals to fight in an attempt to improve its ranking. The schedule for this week is recorded below:</p>
<p>February 20 (Thursday)</p>
<p>Qingbai B—Railway (Youth Cup Final) 3:00 PM Yiyuan Stadium</p>
<p>February 23 (Sunday)</p>
<p>Donghua—Soviet Union (First Division) 3:30 PM Yiguo Stadium</p>
<p>Huaguang—Jiechi (Mayor's Cup) 10:00 AM Zhong No. 1</p>
<p>Kangle—Paramount (Third Division Final) 10:00 AM Zhong No. 2</p>
<p>Jingwu—Customs (Third Division Final) 10:00 AM Zhong No. 3</p>
<p>Second Division—Final (First Week) 2:30 PM Zhong No. 1</p>
<p>The match schedule for the Second Division final teams Shanyun, Railway, and Qingbai B will be decided by drawing lots at the office of this Association at 4:00 PM on February 19 (Wednesday). It is hoped that each team will send one representative to the scene to draw lots at that time.</p>
<h3>Exciting Basketball League Matches; Chunmao Meets Renyu Tonight; Green Forest Faces Huayang, Women's Qingzi Faces Qianghua</h3>
<p>The Second Basketball League will begin at 5:30 PM today. There will be three First Division women's matches at the City Stadium as usual. Tickets will remain the same. The schedule and referees are recorded below:</p>
<p>Women's Qingzi—Qianghua (Women's Division) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Referee Yu Julu</p>
<p>Green Forest—Huayang (Second Division) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Referees Xu Lanmu Jin Botao</p>
<p>Renyu—Chunmao (First Division) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Referees Qu Honglv Yang Liecheng</p>
<p>In the women's division, Women's Qingzi will face Qianghua. This game is not of great importance, but due to the equal strength of the two teams, the battle will be tense. Women's Qingzi has good players such as Wang Wunang, and is a newly emerging force, while the Cao sisters of Qianghua have been training hard and their skills have improved greatly. It is not known who will win at that time.</p>
<p>In the second match, the Second Division Green Forest will face Huayang. The former originally held the ambition to win the championship, but unfortunately, an upset occurred last week, and they were defeated by Peier, suffering a blow. However, their young and brave generals over the years cannot be underestimated. Huayang is mostly composed of old men from the Fat Department, who have fought on the battlefield for a long time and have rich experience. Their lineup is comparable to Green Forest, and both sides have only lost once. Today's meeting is related to the runner-up position.</p>
<p>The finale is the First Division match between Renyu and Chunmao, which is a wonderful game. Chunmao was first formed and defeated the defending champion Hualian, which was the focus of the basketball world for a time. Unfortunately, they have lost to Giants and Hairenqing in the last two games, which is a pity. Renyu's skills are improving rapidly, and their teamwork is superior. Since their debut, they have defeated Encas and were defeated by Giants. They are comparable to Chunmao, and a fierce battle is inevitable.</p>
<h3>Canadian Girl Wins; World Skating Championship</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Stockholm, Sweden, 17th] Canadian beauty Barbara Ann Scott, 18, won the World Women's Figure Skating Championship here today. British girl Walker was second.</p>
<h3>Basketball Friendship Match</h3>
<p>The Gymnasium Loses to the Sports Ground</p>
<p>In a basketball friendship match between the City Sports Ground team and the City Gymnasium team, the two sides met at the Gymnasium at 2:00 PM yesterday. Both Director Gu and Director Li of the Education Bureau, as well as the team leaders Jiang Xiangqing and Shao Rugan, were present to supervise the battle, making the game exceptionally tense. The referee was Chen Liang. In the first quarter, the Sports Ground barely won by a score of 13 to 12, leading by only one point. In the second quarter, Li Wenyuan of the Sports Ground was very active, while the Gymnasium only relied on Yao Minghua and Gong Shiyin to score six points. Therefore, by the end of the first half, the Sports Ground was in the lead with a score of 28 to 18. After switching sides, the competition became more intense, leading to a stalemate. In the third quarter, the score was 41 to 30, with the Sports Ground still in the lead. In the final quarter, Hu Zongshen, Yao Minghua, and Li Guoyuan of the Gymnasium team tried hard to recover, but the Sports Ground team refused to relax. By the end of the game, the Sports Ground defeated the Gymnasium with a score of 55 to 38.</p>
<h3>Railway Department Small Ball League: Business Department to Meet Materials Department Today</h3>
<p>The Railway Department small ball league, which had been postponed due to rain and flooded fields, will resume today at 1:00 PM. The Business Department will face off against the Materials Department. In addition to the famous player Han Longhai, the former team has also welcomed back the strong Gao Baozheng, thus doubling its strength. The latter has evenly distributed talent, and the two sides are evenly matched, so a wonderful performance is expected. The match will be held at the Railway Ball Field on Qiujiang Road.</p>
<h3>Basketball League Situation Tightens Daily: Records of Recent Conditions of Teams in Group A and Women's Group</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The second basketball league is now more than halfway through. The situation in both Group A and Group B of the men's division is becoming increasingly tense, while the women's division is nearing the final stage. The current situation of each group is analyzed as follows:</p>
<h3>Green Team Dominates Women's Group: Final Decisive Battle Against Snow White</h3>
<p>It is virtually certain that the Green Team will dominate the women's group and secure the league title. The night before last, they defeated Qinglian with a score of 54 to 12, with plenty to spare. They only need to wait for the final decisive battle against Snow White to determine the outcome. It is rumored that Qinglian and Snow White have made a defensive alliance agreement, deeply intending to let Snow White have the opportunity. Let's see how the replay between the two sides goes. According to general opinion, the Green Team's lineup may have been stronger in the past than it is this year. Is this true? Snow White has won all three of its matches so far, and based on its performance, it seems capable of contending for the title. However, the Green Team's Liu Zhenbao, Huang Mingyuan, Li Yunzhi, and others have confident shots, and they will compete with the Snow White guards. The intensity of the struggle at that time is expected to be high. Other teams such as the Power Team and the Women's Youth Team have repeatedly lost, mainly because they are still young, but their movements are already showing some promise. Given time, they will easily master the basics. Their spirit in each game is admirable.</p>
<h3>Sponsored by the Jing City Sports Association: First Indoor Basketball Tournament to Be Held at Central University Starting on the 12th</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office] The Nanjing Indoor Basketball League, sponsored by the Nanjing City Sports Association, will be held every Saturday from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and every Sunday from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM at the Central University Gymnasium. This first league is scheduled to begin on the 22nd at the Central University Gymnasium. Nearly 20 basketball teams organized by various government agencies, organizations, schools, military, and police in the Nanjing city area have already registered to participate in the league. The teams' skills and players are divided into men's Group A, Group B, and women's groups. Each men's team is limited to 10 players, and each women's team to 12 players. The men's games will use the latest rules from 1946-1947, while the women's games will use the rules from the 6th National Games. In each game, the winning team will receive two points, and the losing team will receive zero points. The team with the most points in each group will be the champion of that group. If two or more teams in a group have the same number of points, a final match will be scheduled separately. The Jing City Sports Association will award trophies to the champions of each group as a memento.</p>
<h3>Special Feature on Female Athletes: All-Around Athlete Huang Mingyuan</h3>
<p>Miss Huang Mingyuan, a pillar of the Green Team and a strong player in both basketball and volleyball in this city, has been in the limelight in Shanghai sports arenas in recent years. Therefore, Miss Huang Mingyuan is indeed the most ideal subject for a "Special Feature on Female Athletes." Some may question this, but my answer is: she is capable in all sports, and many of them have yielded exceptional results. Miss Huang has contributed greatly to the Green Team's many championship trophies over the years.</p>
<p>Has the Style of a Tomboy</p>
<p>She has at least a bit of a "tomboy" style, so—on the court, she has earned the nickname "A Yuan," a natural—childish nickname, indeed—she is sometimes so lively and uninhibited. When she watches the game with rapt attention, she will exclaim, jump, and even dance for joy for no apparent reason. In short, what she shows on the outside is purely natural and innocent. As for her physique, she cannot be said to be fat or thin. In terms of height, she is about average for a Chinese person, approximately five feet two inches tall. Her legs are very developed, of course, due to exercise. In terms of temperament, judging by her appearance, one would think she is extremely impatient, but in fact, the opposite is true. Outside of sports, she is always so quiet and taciturn.</p>
<p>School and Sports Life</p>
<p>She is a graduate of the Gongyi Girls' Middle School. In junior high school, she began to show promise in sports at the school, participating in everything. At that time, Zhang Lizhu, Zhang Huizhu, Yang Feibi, and others dominated the scene, and because she was still young, she couldn't quite catch up for a while. It wasn't until her third year of junior high school, when she was selected as a school representative, that she amazed everyone. Her performance was not inferior to that of several veteran players, so everyone began to look at her in a new light. Coupled with her natural talent for sports, her achievements improved rapidly. Basketball and volleyball became her main focus, and she also excelled in track and field events such as the 50-meter, 100-meter, and long jump, as well as cycling races, becoming famous for a time. In her third year of senior high school, she transferred to Minli Girls' Middle School, so she can be considered a top student of Minli.</p>
<p>An All-Around Player in Basketball and Volleyball</p>
<p>Since she is an all-around player, let me analyze her skills. Basketball: She is a good forward and also scores points. She can steal the ball, she understands the game, she can shoot accurately, and she can follow up effectively. She is truly a standard forward and can be said to have the style of a complete male athlete. Volleyball: She is a good second-line player and also a scorer on the team. Her spikes are almost as powerful as those of a man. When she spikes the ball, most young girls are afraid, which shows her strength. Furthermore, her 100-meter and long jump results were said to be very good in the past. This is based on her elasticity and speed. However, due to field conditions in recent years, her results cannot be confirmed. She once said that if she were to practice, she would be confident in scoring points in the National Games. The National Games is imminent, and I hope she can work hard.</p>
<p>At Home, She is a Young Lady</p>
<p>A Yuan is still unmarried. Her family is quite well-off, so—at home, she doesn't need to work so diligently. She listens to the radio and reads magazines when she has time. Sometimes, when she is in the mood, she will hum along to the songs on the radio by herself. According to friends who have heard her sing, A Yuan has a very sweet voice and has quite a bit of knowledge of music, making her a true singer. This is also one of her family leisure activities. It is said that when she is happy, she will even go into the kitchen, put on a white coat, and cook a few dishes that her mother and she like to eat. Aside from family life, she is completely active on the sports field. (Meizi)</p>
<h3>Contest for Places in the Basketball League: Renyu Should Beat Chunmao Tonight</h3>
<p>In the past, Renyu was often defeated by South China. Tonight, when they face Chunmao, the reincarnation of South China, Renyu should beat Chunmao based on the current state of the two teams.</p>
<p>South China has three shooters: He Jingui, Li Ruixiong, and Liu Fushan. Chunmao only retains Fushan, while Renyu has more evenly distributed shooting talent.</p>
<p>If Renyu assigns two players to keep a close eye on Fushan, Chunmao will be in a paralyzed state, and Renyu can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>However, Chunmao's defense should not be underestimated. He Hanfu, Huang Tianlie, and Zheng Jiabiao all have unpredictable shooting accuracy. Chunmao can focus on defense, and the score difference will not be too large. How Fushan can break free from the double-teaming is the highlight and the key to victory or defeat.</p>
<p>In terms of stamina, Renyu is more abundant than Chunmao, and tonight's battle, stamina should also be a factor in victory. (Changnian)</p>
<p>Women's Youth Purple: Four wins, one loss, 13 points, 1250 goals</p>
<p>Women's Youth Red: Four wins, zero losses, 13 points, 250 goals</p>
<p>Power Team: Five matches, zero wins, five points, 000 goals</p>
<h3>Hoping That the Shantou Team Will Stand Out: The Veterans of the Hualian Team Are Not Old</h3>
<p>In Group A, the Shantou team has already won three out of three matches, and its hope for this year's championship seems to be higher than that of other teams. Overwhelming the Hailu Youth team in the first match boosted their morale even further, so dealing with the Railway, Jing, and All Blacks teams was of course easy. Watching their guest appearance against Columbus the night before last, they were defeated due to the disparity in height, which was "not due to a fault in strategy." The Giants have also won four consecutive matches, but they struggled quite a bit when they fought Chunmao, and their match against Renyu was also in a precarious situation. That team also has championship ambitions, and the reporter sincerely hopes that the Shantou team will work hard and stand out. The Hualian team was the champion of the first Group A. This time, they were unfortunately defeated by Chunmao by a narrow margin of one point, which dampened their spirits, but they still have the aura of "old people are still strong." If they can take good care of themselves, hope is not lost.</p>
<h3>Chenyou in Group B Has Hope: Major Battle Against Green Forest Imminent</h3>
<p>In Group B, Chenyou easily defeated Jiashen by a score of 60 to 31 the night before last. In the four matches, they have been a consistent winner, and Chenyou has the highest voice in Group B. However, Green Forest has emerged with talented people, and their ages are all in their prime. This Saturday, there will definitely be a grand spectacle. Although Huayang A was defeated by Chenyou, they are still waiting for an opportunity to act. Their hope lies entirely in subduing the "Green Forest" heroes, and they hope that Green Forest can defeat Chenyou, as they are afraid of the world being too peaceful.</p>
<h3>Jingwu Sports Association: Organizes Weightlifting Class</h3>
<p>In order to discover weightlifting talent, the Jingwu Sports Association has organized a weightlifting training class to cultivate talent using standard tools and methods. It convened a meeting of comrades yesterday and decided to appoint Chen Xuliang as the head teacher and Weng Kangting as the volunteer instructor. Training will be held every Sunday morning from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. All are welcome to participate, and tuition is free.</p>
<h3>France-Italy Basketball Game</h3>
<p>French National Team Wins</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Boulogne, 16th] The French national basketball team played against the Italian team today, with a huge crowd watching. They won with a score of 36 to 28.</p>
<h3>Two Badminton League Matches Today</h3>
<p>The first badminton league organized by the Badminton Committee will have two Group B matches starting at 6:00 PM today, held at Yucai Middle School and Municipal Girls' Middle School respectively. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Central Bank Ordered to Collect Gold Certificates: Official Gold Price 4.8 Million: More US Dollars Collected Than Gold Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Central Bank's exchange rate for telegraphic transfers of US dollars has been changed to 12,000 yuan per US dollar selling price, in accordance with regulations. Based on this, the buying price per US dollar is 11,900 yuan. The exchange rate for telegraphic transfers of British pounds is 48,360 yuan per pound selling price, and 47,960 yuan buying price. Exchange rates for other countries can be calculated accordingly. Furthermore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, the Central Bank's gold price was also set at 4.8 million yuan for the purchase price of each ten-tael bar. After the announcement of the price yesterday, Chinese and foreign citizens holding US dollars went to the bank to exchange them, and the situation was quite enthusiastic. The bank's Foreign Exchange Section of the Business Bureau directly collected the currencies. Each US dollar had to be deducted 3% for shipping costs, so the actual purchase price was 11,640 yuan. It is said that the total amount collected throughout the day was about 250,000 US dollars. The amount of gold collected was not as much as the US dollars, and most of it was from fellow silver and coin shops who were forced to exchange due to their position.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a report, the Central Bank announced the exchange prices for gold and US dollars at 10:00 AM yesterday, as follows: (1) Gold: 4.8 million yuan per bar; (2) US Dollars: buying price 11,900 yuan, selling price 12,000 yuan; (3) Forward Foreign Exchange: first month buying price 12,260 yuan, selling price 12,360 yuan; second month buying price 12,620 yuan, selling price 12,720 yuan; third month buying price 12,980 yuan, selling price 13,080 yuan; (4) British Pounds: buying price 47,960 yuan, selling price 48,360 yuan; (5) Hong Kong Dollars: selling price 3,022.50 yuan; (6) US Notes: buying price 11,640 yuan, selling price 12,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Shops and Silver Shops All Closed: Money Exchange Businesses Also Stopped Buying and Selling Gold Certificates and Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Since the Central Government announced the emergency economic measures, the gold certificate market and silver shop industry in this city all closed down yesterday. The reporter interviewed responsible persons from the money exchange industry and the silver shop industry to inquire about their reactions. According to Zai Yuncheng, Chairman of the Money Exchange Industry Association, after learning of the plan announced by the Central Government yesterday morning, they immediately complied with the order to stop buying and selling all gold certificates and foreign currencies. The money exchange industry absolutely supports the government's measures, and the association has decided on two steps: (1) to wait for the government to stipulate the scope of the money exchange industry's future business and how to implement it; (2) if no measures are announced after three days, the money exchange industry plans to send representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance to resolve the livelihood issues of employees. Finally, Zai Yuncheng also stated that more than half of the money exchange businesses in the city still opened as usual yesterday, but they stopped trading in gold certificates or foreign currencies.</p>
<p>According to Yao Lianfang, the person in charge of the Silver Shop Industry Association's reorganization committee, after learning of the news, the Silver Shop Industry Association immediately convened an emergency meeting of members and decided to temporarily close all of the city's more than 200 silver shops. In the morning, they sent representatives Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, Chen Dezhang, and Qiu Yunliang to visit Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, at around 10:00 AM. According to Lin, the issue of gold allocation for the silver shop industry in the future must be agreed upon by Central Bank President Bei and others before detailed measures are announced. Before these measures are announced, he hoped that the silver shop industry would maintain a calm attitude and wait for the authorities' disposition. Then, at around 11:00 AM, they visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, who had not returned from Beijing, so Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Bureau, met with them instead. He expressed sympathy for the temporary closure of the silver shop association and instructed them to visit Mayor Wu at 4:00 PM to request instructions on various issues in the future. The Silver Shop Industry Association prepared a written report and visited Mayor Wu at 4:00 PM, but Mayor Wu was too busy with official business and changed the meeting to 9:00 AM this morning. The Silver Shop Industry Association originally planned to convene a general meeting of members last night, where Wang would report on the visits to various parties and discuss various business issues in the future, but the meeting was postponed because Mayor Wu changed the meeting to today.</p>
<p>According to another report, a total of 158 silver shops in the city have joined the association. According to the majority of members, if the Central Bank still allocates and sells gold to the silver shop industry in the same way as before, the silver shops will continue to operate as usual, regardless of the price at which the Central Bank allocates the gold. The Gold Industry Association convened an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss future business policies. As of now, the association has more than 60 members.</p>
<h3>Import Licenses for Less Than 2,000 US Dollars</h3>
<p>Designated Banks Must No Longer Issue Them</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Business Bureau and the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank issued three circulars to all designated banks yesterday. The thirteenth circular of the second category stated: "In order to invite government orders, from February 17, 1947, for the goods listed in Schedules 1 and 3 (A), if their C.I.F. price does not exceed US$2,000 or equivalent currency value, the designated banks may no longer approve the import permit applications for these goods." Circular No. 81 stated that the provisions of Circulars No. 77, 79, and 80 regarding government subsidies for export trade were hereby canceled. Circular No. 82 urged the designated banks to pay attention to revising Article 19 of the Central Bank's Interim Measures for Foreign Exchange Management, namely: "Each bank shall promptly report to the Central Bank the total amount of its foreign currency deposits as of the day before the promulgation of this revised measure. Thereafter, it shall report once at the end of each month until all accounts are settled." It requested the designated banks to increase the reporting accordingly.</p>
<h3>Export Subsidies: Import Surcharges: Jianghai Customs Ordered: Announcement of Abolition</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] After the abolition of the export subsidy and import surcharge system, Jianghai Customs posted Announcement No. 116 yesterday, which stated: "It has been found that imported goods, from February 6 this year, shall be subject to a surcharge of 50% ad valorem based on the customs valuation, as announced in Proclamation No. 115. Now, the Inspector General of Customs has received an order from the government that the surcharge shall be abolished from today, etc., and is ordered to comply with it, etc. Apart from complying with it, it is hereby announced for public knowledge. February 17, 36th year of the Republic of China, Tax Officer Liu Yuyi."</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Continues: Rationing of Artificial Silk</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The committee of the Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the sale of government materials and property, held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, attended by Wang Zijian, Yang Jinsheng, and others. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. It was decided to continue rationing artificial silk, based on the rationing quota for December of last year. Yesterday, one-fifth of the quota was first allocated to the silk weaving industry, about 500 boxes. Also, one-fifth of the quota will be allocated to the ribbon weaving industry this Thursday, totaling 37 and a half boxes. The rationing price remains the same. For example, the price of 120 count Gaoshan silk is still 2.76 million yuan.</p>
<h3>If Raw Materials Are Not Allocated: Oil Rationing Cannot Be Restored</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] According to a responsible person from the Oil Pressing Association, the suspension of edible oil rationing is due to unavoidable reasons. The oil mills cannot continue to maintain oil rationing while incurring large losses. Because the negotiated price of soybean oil is too low, while the price of soybeans has no limit. Currently, the asking price for soybeans has risen to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. If the price of soybean oil is still set at 180,000 yuan per load, each load will inevitably incur a loss of about 10,000 yuan. Moreover, the oil price in other ports, such as Kunshan, has risen to 270,000 to 280,000 yuan, and the price of soybeans is also between 70,000 and 80,000 yuan. Due to the relationship between cost and high interest rates, most oil mills are suffering from losses. Although the authorities have allowed the allocation of par-priced soybeans this time, the allocation date and quantity have not been determined. If par-priced soybeans cannot be allocated, the rationing of edible oil cannot be restored for the time being.</p>
<h3>Import Quotas for Category II Goods: February to April: Import Control Committee Announced Yesterday: Totaling US$99,675,000</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Provisional Import Management Committee announced yesterday the revised quotas for Category II goods in the Interim Measures for Import and Export Trade for February to April of this year and made the following statement: "The government firmly believes that the quotas for various goods set this time are sufficient to meet the needs of domestic industry while guiding the country's foreign exchange resources into the most advantageous channels. For example, the quota for petroleum products is greater than the pre-war import volume. Because the source of coal is currently difficult, diesel is necessary for industry and shipping, and gasoline and kerosene each have their own urgent needs. The cotton quota is determined according to the importance of the textile industry and the possibility of cotton yarn exports. At the same time, in addition to trade control, the government is also striving to plan for the increased production of domestic cotton this year in order to reduce the consumption of foreign cotton. The quotas for rice, wheat, and wheat flour, which are needed for the people's livelihood, should be able to supplement the shortage of domestic food. The cigarette industry is one of the country's main sources of tax revenue, and the permitted import of tobacco leaves is closely related to maintaining national tax revenue. The quotas for jute and burlap bags are almost three times the pre-war import volume. This is because they are used to package export goods, which is of great benefit to encouraging export trade. As for the quotas for rayon, metal products, and wood, they do not include the quantities that can be obtained through barter trade with Japan. The quotas for other Category II goods are mostly determined based on the average import value in the three years before the war. The domestic production situation and the possibility of using domestic goods as substitutes have also been taken into consideration. We know that foreign prices have increased, and the quotas for some goods may not be able to meet all domestic needs, but we should be aware that the country is facing difficult times, and the use of foreign goods must be economized as much as possible. It is believed that people across the country will also be able to make joint efforts in saving the country's foreign exchange." The quota figures for Category II goods for February to April of this year are announced as follows:</p>
<p>(Unit: US$1,000 or equivalent foreign currency)</p>
<p>Name of Goods: Quota for February to April</p>
<p>Gasoline, Diesel, Kerosene: 12,075</p>
<p>Cotton: 40,000</p>
<p>Rice, Wheat, Wheat Flour: 20,000</p>
<p>Tobacco Leaves: 8,000</p>
<p>Jute and Burlap Bags: 1,250</p>
<p>Coal and Coke: 500</p>
<p>Metal Products: 3,750</p>
<p>Chemicals: 2,000</p>
<p>Paper (including pulp): 3,450</p>
<p>Wood: 1,830</p>
<p>Wool and Velvet Yarn: 1,400</p>
<p>Rayon, Indigo, Sulfurized Metanil, and Dyes: 2,275</p>
<p>Rubber and Products: 1,100</p>
<p>Lubricating Oil, Grease, Wax: 1,160</p>
<p>Machine Belts, Powder, Tanning Materials: 345</p>
<p>Ammonium Sulfate and Other Fertilizers: (Suspended)</p>
<p>Rayon (Raw Materials): 565</p>
<p>Medicines: (Suspended)</p>
<p>Cement: (Suspended)</p>
<p>Automobiles: (Suspended)</p>
<p>Sugar: (Suspended)</p>
<p>Total: 99,675</p>
<h3>Major Investors Want to Catch Them Off Guard: Unified Bonds Rise and Fall First</h3>
<p>The major investors in public bonds yesterday wanted to raise the price before selling, so they rose and then fell back. As soon as Tongbing opened in the morning, there was competition to buy it. Rooms such as 604 had to cover their positions. The bulls took the opportunity to raise the price forcefully, starting from 7,200 yuan, and raised it to over 9,000 yuan before it stopped rising. They rushed to sell. Major investors such as Chengde and Room 504 were eager to sell, and it fell back to within 5,500 yuan near noon, and then began to consolidate. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu all fell by 600 yuan to 900 yuan. Tongbing fell by 1,800 yuan, with a transaction volume of 8 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Congestion of Goods Arriving from Various Guilds; Rice Prices Continue to Plummet; Market Prices of Cooking Oil and Miscellaneous Grains Mostly Trend Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday's registration of rice and grain arrivals showed 1,566.485 shi at the Southern Market and 7,896 shi at the Northern Market, totaling 9,462 shi, 4 dou, and 8.5 sheng for both markets.  The arrival of goods from various guilds is congested. This is because, after deliberation and adjustments, merchants from all routes considered it profitable and transported goods from the production areas to Shanghai.  However, coinciding with the government's adoption of emergency economic measures prohibiting the buying and selling of gold and currency, most rice merchants are also deeply wary.  General peddlers believe this price is still appropriate and are eager to sell, while rice shops are instead hesitant.  In this situation of supply exceeding demand, the market is in a slump, and the prices of all goods have fallen within the provisional price limits.  They have fallen by 7,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to last weekend.  The future foundation of the market is still weak, and transactions within the market are completely open.  If subsequent arrivals continue, there is hope that the rice market trend will continue to fall.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>In the morning, due to close inspection by the Social Affairs Bureau personnel, flour merchants and brokers avoided the limelight and did not trade.  It was not until near noon that the market slightly improved, but because rice prices continued to fall, everyone was pessimistic, few buyers came in, and there were very few transactions.  Only "Kaililang" foreign flour was traded at 72,000 yuan midway. The later market lacked buyers, and the afternoon takeover price was only 70,000 yuan. "Warship" flour was traded at 52,000 yuan, and the later market also showed weakness.  The prices of various brands of flour continued to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.  The decline in bran prices was slower, with a slight decrease of just over 500 yuan.  No transactions for wheat have been reported.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>There was another decline. Amidst frequent reports of falling prices for various goods, the market atmosphere was uncertain, and those holding goods were eager to sell.  Therefore, the supply on the market was abundant, but the local sales were quite limited.  Crude raw oil opened at just below 10,000 yuan and closed at 220,000 yuan, with no inquirers. This was more than 20,000 yuan lower than the previous market. New and old barrelled raw oil also fell by more than 10,000 yuan accordingly.  The situation of soybean oil was also weak, falling by 13,000 to 15,000 yuan.  Our factory's clear oil followed the decline by more than 20,000 yuan, with trades at 216,000 yuan.  Small cart sesame oil fell by another 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Market prices mostly trended downward.  There were few transactions for soybeans, only local purchases and sales.  The prices of various goods were reduced by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.  However, the arrival of Pinghu soybeans was especially high, and the market atmosphere turned sharply downward, plummeting by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.  Sesame merchants were all helpless, and the price fell by more than 10,000 yuan. Red beans were sluggish, red sorghum was weak, corn fell by just over 1,000 yuan, raw peanuts fell by around 10,000 yuan, and soybean cakes had few customers and many suppliers, falling by 2,000 yuan.  Only broad beans were scarce and expensive, continuing to increase by 5,000 yuan. Green beans had demand from the South, and the market trend was firm.</p>
<h3>Floating Capital Tends Towards Chinese Stocks; Market Conditions Rotate and Rise</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to rise yesterday. Financial institutions and foreign firms had particularly strong buying appetite. Wing On Textile once approached the limit up, but the securities firms with large holdings sold when prices were high, and there were frequent pullbacks after the rise. The opening was high, and there was still competition to buy after the opening. Nos. 220, 47 bank groups entered, and Nos. 218, 199, 22, 95, and 172 bought one after another. Wing On Textile gradually rose to 1,780 yuan before struggling slightly. Nos. 76, 95, 218, 94, 105, 232, 224, and 125 bought again. China Flour, Kin Hsing, and Franco-Chinese (high price reached 60 yuan) successively hit the limit up. Wing On Textile rose to 1,950 yuan, and spot delivery reached 1,915 yuan, the limit up. Nos. 178, 105, 97, 151, and 203 sold at high prices, falling to 1,870 yuan. Spot delivery of Mei Ya and Innerwear also hit the limit up. Nos. 43 and 217 were still buying, and there was a rebound. Nos. 14, 28, 35, 186, 217, 102, 198, 36, and 91 all offered old stock, lowering Wing On Textile to 1,810 yuan. Nos. 133, 158, and 218 still took deliveries at low prices, once rebounding to 1,850 yuan. After 11 o'clock, it gradually declined. Nos. 36, 35, 91, 84, 171, and 145 sold again, seeing a low price of 1,780 yuan. Although Nos. 230, 180, 47, and 207 entered, Nos. 91, 14, 218, 100, 224, and 12 still sold down to 1,760 yuan. Nos. 177, 95, 224, 89, 22, and 188 came in at low prices, rebounding again to 1,820 yuan. The selling pressure from Nos. 198, 85, 91, and 145 was still strong, and the low price remained around 1,780 yuan. No. 224 had a healthy buying appetite, and at noon it again surpassed around 1,810 yuan. It closed slightly lower after the close. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Textile rose slightly, China Flour, Hsin Ho, and Mei Ya rose by half a percent, Hsin Kwang, Liang Fu, and China Flour each rose by one percent. Spot delivery of Wing On Textile, Hsin Kwang, China Flour, and Ching Foo each rose by about one percent. Cold stocks of domestic goods rose by half a percent, and the rest all rose by about one percent. In the afternoon, Nos. 14, 13, 224, 223, and 211 all sold. After the opening, it gradually fell to 1,722 yuan. No. 97, 31, and 220 entered at a good price of 20 yuan. It was rumored that credit in the banking sector was extremely tight, and that some were selling gold at a reduced price to the Central Bank to cover shortfalls. People were timid. Nos. 145, 199, 84, 83, 94, 211, 213, 76, and 91 sold aggressively, and it fell to 1,700 yuan. After entering, Nos. 97, 145, 224, 102, 47, and 156 once rose to 1,770 yuan. Nos. 91, 145, 178, 198, 197, and 152 still had selling appetite, and retreated again to around 1,710 yuan. Nos. 171, 99, 76, 211, and 95 came in. Mei Ya suddenly rose sharply, and some even had a premium of more than 50 yuan, rebounding to 1,790 yuan. Nos. 14 and 12 still had supply, falling to 1,745 yuan. Nos. 95, 28, 219, 145, and 154 bought one after another. Near the close, it recovered again. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Textile and Hsin Ho rose by a strong half a percent, Hsin Kwang and Kin Hsing rose by a weak one percent, China Flour, Mei Ya, and Ching Foo each rose by one and a half percent. Spot delivery of Wing On Textile and Hsin Ho rose by a strong half a percent, Hsin Kwang rose by a weak one percent, China Flour, Ching Foo, and Mei Ya each rose by around one and a half percent. Cold stock Tung Yih was flat due to ex-dividend, Innerwear, Cement, and Wing Kung each rose by around one and a half percent, and the rest rose by between half a percent and one percent. There were no special changes in off-market stocks.</p>
<h3>Liu Gongyun, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, Discusses the Real Situation of Foreign Rice Transportation to China</h3>
<p>More Than One Million Dan in March</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter, concerned about the actual situation of large quantities of foreign rice arriving in China, inquired with Liu Gongyun, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, who is responsible for purchasing and transporting the rice. Director Liu kindly informed us that the Washington International Emergency Food Committee allocated a large quantity of foreign rice for our country to purchase and transport from various regions in the first half of this year. In March, our government can purchase 24,900 tons in Siam, 35,070 tons in Vietnam, and 23,600 tons in Burma, totaling 83,570 tons, equivalent to 1,050,000 dan. The amount of foreign rice purchased and transported by our government in April, May, and June is also very large and has not yet been included in the calculations. The Central Trust Bureau has been ordered to purchase and transport as much as possible and has dispatched Bi Nangli, Qing Kang, Commissioner Huang Zhaoming, Deputy Director Yue Yanglie, and others to Bangkok, Rangoon, Saigon, and other places to negotiate purchases and request assistance from local embassies, consulates, the Bank of China, and other relevant parties. Director Liu also stated that Shanghai already has a reserve of foreign rice, and with the import of the above foreign rice, the food supply for the citizens will absolutely not be a problem.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Are Internally Strong but Outwardly Subdued</h3>
<p>Yesterday's trend in woolen fabrics was internally strong but outwardly subdued. Standard quotations increased in an instant, and once sold, they were often difficult to replenish. Since the foreign exchange rate was revised to 12,000 legal currency per US dollar, those in the industry have been mutually hoarding limited stocks and temporarily not opening for business. The transfer transactions of brokers have therefore become increasingly difficult. Apart from winter goods such as overcoating fabrics, all other widely-used men's and women's suits of various colors made of coarse and fine wool, as well as suit lining materials, were all in short supply.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Plunge; Few Buyers for Spinning and Weaving Listed by the Trustee</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became increasingly unsustainable. At the beginning of the morning, "Special Double Horse" and 42-count double-ply yarn fell by 500,000, with the latter trading at 6,500,000 and the former trading at 3,950,000 yuan. The decline in ordinary combed yarn was slightly slower, also falling by 100,000 to 200,000. Due to the sudden tightening of credit, coupled with the authorities dispatching personnel to the market for supervision, and rumors that the Garrison Command's yarn and cloth investigation team has begun auditing accounts, speculators were extremely panicked, morale was greatly weakened, and the situation was quite exhausted. By the close, "Special Double Horse" had fallen again to 3,800,000, and there were still few buyers. At 2 p.m., the Trustee for Spinning and Weaving listed yarns from private cotton mills, and the prices of various brands of yarn were similar to those in the market, but there were very few buyers.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Weaken</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also initially rose and then fell yesterday, and were even weaker in the afternoon. Ewo Silk began to fall back from 16,200 yuan and ended at a low price. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jardine Spinning and British American Tobacco each fell by half a percent, while the rest had minimal increases and decreases.</p>
<h3>China United Insurance Company Moves to New Address Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the past, the insurance industry was dominated by foreign merchants with strong influence, and the outflow of benefits was regrettable. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the situation has changed. The Chinese people deeply felt the close relationship between the insurance industry and industry and commerce, and they pooled funds to operate on their own. Up to now, the business has been progressing day by day, and China United Property Insurance Company is particularly outstanding. The chairman of the company is Tang Xiaozhai, Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and the General Manager is Tan Junsheng, Deputy General Manager of Nanfeng Industrial Company. The scope of business includes all types of insurance other than life insurance, such as water, fire, and property insurance. Recently, due to the increasing business, the original office space on the second floor of Jiangsu Bank was insufficient, so yesterday it moved to a new office building on the second floor of No. 33 Ningbo Road. The building has been renovated, and congratulatory guests filled the door, which was very lively.</p>
<h3>After the Cessation of Gold and Currency Trading, Prices of General Commodities Fell More Than They Rose; The Prospect of Long-Term Price Stability Is Hopeful</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the Supreme National Defense Council passed the resolution to have the Central Bank collect and redeem gold and American currency at the listed price, the market for gold and currency in this city completely stalled yesterday. All gold shops, money exchange shops, securities firms, etc., complied with the order and did not conduct gold and currency transactions. The market prices of other general commodities also mostly fell more than they rose.</p>
<p>Tight Headwinds in Business Circles</p>
<p>Chinese stock transactions once rose sharply, but then quickly returned to level, and transactions were not high. As for the prices of various export goods such as pig bristles and sausage casings, none were opened, and there were no transactions. Tung oil, dried egg white, and frozen eggs, etc., had prices opened, which had risen by 10% to 20% compared to last Saturday's prices, but there were also no transactions. It is generally thought that all parties are still taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the new economic measures. However, since last Saturday, the market capital has been tightening. Most firms and exchanges are only receiving and not releasing. This is because the Central Trust Bureau auctioned off a large number of miscellaneous materials yesterday, and allocated rayon. The Spinning and Construction Company also sold cotton yarn on behalf of the Spinning Management Committee. The Taiwan Sugar Company is still expected to sell sugar as usual this Thursday, so it is anticipated that the future of capital will become increasingly tight. Yesterday, not a few firms and exchanges were forced by tight capital to seek redemption from the Central Bank. This is because, according to the newly promulgated Measures for the Control of Financial Business, if any firm or exchange becomes illiquid and the Central Bank stops its bill clearing, it should be ordered to suspend business immediately and have its license revoked. Therefore, all firms and exchanges are trying to be cautious to prevent any unexpected events. Although the capital clearing of various firms and exchanges at the bill clearing house was somewhat tighter than usual yesterday, no cases of grounding occurred.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Consideration and Considerable Initiative</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] Economist Yang Yinpu, at the request of our reporter, expressed his views on the emergency economic measures plan as follows: (1) The new method has two major advantages: one is that it is multifaceted, and not like the past of "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts." Prices, foreign exchange rates, wage rates, etc., are all comprehensively considered. The second is that it is quite proactive, taking a step ahead of the actual situation. The adjustment of the exchange rate is one such aspect. Therefore, this plan is a relatively ideal solution at present, and I believe that prices can be stabilized for a long time. (2) The experience of the past has been that after foreign exchange adjustments, domestic prices have risen sharply, but today's situation is an exception, because floating capital has been frozen by gold, and market credit is surprisingly tight with surprisingly high underground interest rates. Wing On Textile did not stop auctions in the morning due to price increases, and there is no power to disrupt the market. After the policy of absorbing currency with gold is stopped in the future, it will be replaced by the sale of shares of state-owned factories, such as the Spinning and Construction Company, which has long had the intention of selling to private operators after two years of operation. In this way, floating capital will also have a legitimate outlet. (3) The restriction of wage rates is also a reasonable measure, because the high cost of wages is indeed a crisis for our country's industry. Now the government rations daily necessities while restricting wage increases, which is very reasonable. However, the most important point is that the implementation must be practical.</p>
<p>Extremely Beneficial to the Export Industry</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] Our reporter recently interviewed Qiu Liangying of the Import and Export Association and asked about the impact of the emergency economic measures plan on our country's export trade. Mr. Qiu answered as follows: (1) This measure is extremely beneficial to our country's export industry because it can take all aspects into consideration. If export subsidy measures are implemented, the cost of export goods will skyrocket and completely offset the government's subsidies. The current new method not only raises the exchange rate but also strictly controls domestic prices. If the cost of export goods is not high, the overseas sales market will definitely improve. (2) According to the new exchange rate, our country's main export goods, such as tung oil and pig bristles, which could not be traded in the past due to high prices, are now in a favorable position. However, competition in the international market for silk and tea is very fierce, so the outlook is not good. (3) It is not yet certain whether the situation of exporting goods from Hong Kong can be eliminated in the future. This depends on whether a black market price for foreign exchange occurs in the future. In the past, exporting via South China, with transportation by land, also had high costs. Merchants will consider whether exporting from domestic seaports is more cost-effective than exporting from Hong Kong. (4) One of the measures taken by the government this time is to restrict wage rates, with the aim of reducing costs and reducing currency issuance. For the people, this is an act of thrift. The Chairman has already requested workers to demonstrate their patriotism and frugality in today's speech.</p>
<p>The Import Business Will Inevitably Shrink</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] Zhou Jingwei, the person in charge of the city's Import and Export Industry Association, gave the following views on the emergency economic measures plan and the future of the export industry: (1) After the implementation of the new measures, if domestic prices do not rise, the increase in the exchange rate will be beneficial to our country's export industry. However, most of our country's export industry is under the control of the government, and only a small portion is privately operated. In the current process of currency inflation, the general public attaches importance to preserving goods, so even with the stimulus of the newly revised exchange rate, they may not be willing to dispose of them immediately. (2) In terms of the import industry, it will shrink in the future, because the foreign exchange quota within six months is only 200 million US dollars, and the amount allocated to each industry is very small. After the raw materials used by domestic industries that rely on foreign countries are exhausted, they will deeply feel the difficulty of continuing. (3) The government's current policy is to tighten credit and reduce the purchasing power of the market in order to avoid price fluctuations caused by the fluctuations of floating capital, and the intention is excellent. However, attention should be paid to the fact that after the people's purchasing power is weakened, it will also affect the consumption of legitimate goods, leading to commercial depression. This is quite obstructive to the government's plan to increase tax revenue.</p>
<p>Prices of American Goods Increased by About 10%</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the government announced the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" and prohibited the buying and selling of gold and American currency, and the official price of the US dollar was raised to 12,000 yuan, the reaction of department stores and American goods stores here was relatively calm. This is because the prices of various goods had already been adjusted according to the black market US dollar price. On the other hand, it is also because merchants are still watching the price trend. The prices of some American goods have increased by about 10%. Carnation milk powder sells for 25,000 yuan per pound, Carnation evaporated milk for 4,500 yuan, Camel brand cigarettes for 3,500 yuan, Colgate toothpaste (large size) for 15,000 yuan, Pond's cold cream for 18,000 yuan, Sullivan biscuits for 9,000 yuan per pound, and Ovaltine chocolate candy for 1,500 yuan per piece.</p>

<h3>Reserve Force of Huainan Coal Mine: New Developments in the Xinzhuangzi Coal Seam</h3>
<p>— Wuhu Dispatch on the 6th, Special Correspondent Kang Feng</p>
<p>Following the Jinpu Railway to Bengbu, and then transferring to the Huainan Railway, I arrived at Jiulonggang, the location of the Huainan Mining Bureau.</p>
<p>Jiulonggang is a small village at the foot of Mount Shungeng. When the Huainan Coal Mine began drilling in 1930, there were only six households. Now, sixteen years later, the Huainan Mining Bureau has built a small world for its employees to live in, in the area between the railway and the coal mine. Those with some status within the mining bureau all live here. A spacious and exquisite guesthouse is also located in this residential area. Jiulonggang is isolated in the fields of the Huai River basin. The people from the mining bureau come from places like Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Chongqing, and Kunming; some have even recently left the urban peak of New York. Naturally, they welcome people from big cities to chat. Last August, Xie Jiarong, a geological authority with a different perspective on the existing Huainan coal mines, came from Nanjing, and was naturally welcomed by them.</p>
<p>Xie Jiarong himself only intended to visit this place, which currently supplies coal to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway and for the transportation, industry, and power plants of the Beijing-Shanghai area, without intending to make any contribution. However, many profound figures are buried in this Jiulonggang Mining Bureau. Among them, engineer Chai Dengbang originally worked with Xie Jiarong in the Exploration Department of the Resources Committee. When the two met in Jiulonggang, they couldn't help but discuss the geological conditions of the Jiulonggang area.</p>
<p>They discussed the lifespan of the Huainan Coal Mine, its natural lifespan and social lifespan. Readers can imagine that these two are specialists in excavating the secrets of the Earth's crust, so they can accurately determine how long the prosperity of this mining area, which currently gathers nearly 70,000 people, will last. Similarly, they decided to resolve the doubts in their hearts through actual exploration. They hypothesized that since there is a bay-shaped coal-bearing stratum on the south bank of the Huai River, including Jiulonggang and Datong, this stratum must have its origins and destination. The two decided to investigate where the Huainan coal-bearing stratum went!</p>
<p>The current structure of the Huainan Mining Bureau is a mixed economy. It is neither state-owned nor purely private capital. The head office in Shanghai has a group of far-sighted commanders, while the mining area has a group of efficient executives. Since a scientist like Xie Jiarong was willing to see how the coal-bearing stratum flowed underground, the mining bureau immediately provided them with the only small jeep, painted red, for their use.</p>
<p>Investigating the Huainan Coal System</p>
<p>Xie Jiarong and Chai Dengbang began their investigation of the whereabouts of the Huainan coal-bearing stratum.</p>
<p>On the first day, from Jiulonggang to Da _, the two frequently got out of the car to study the rocks of Mount Shungeng.</p>
<p>On the second day, from Datong to Yabeipu, the jeep could not pass. Ahead were hills, so they abandoned the car and walked along the mountain road, passing through Sunjiagang, Cheluoshan, and Lijia'ao.</p>
<p>The surface of the mountain road was loess, so they dared not determine whether the coal-bearing stratum followed this path, but this area is precisely the inner edge of the basin-shaped terrain of the Huainan mining area. The coal-bearing stratum of Jiulonggang and Datong, stretching for ten kilometers, is located on the southern inner edge of the Huainan basin. Of course, if the geological conditions of the inner edges of the other three sides are the same as those of Jiulonggang and Datong, then the coal seam can be determined to be within it!</p>
<p>The two believed that there was no need to go further, and returned to the Jiulonggang mining area. Xie Jiarong decided to work with Chai Dengbang to find out the subsequent story of the Huainan coal seam, which does not occupy a position on the important mineral distribution map he compiled (in the "Shen Bao" 60th Anniversary China Provincial Map).</p>
<p>He returned to Nanjing, and soon brought a surveying team. This was a group of his old colleagues from the Resources Committee, who had followed him for eight years, knocking on the mountains and rocks with mineral deposits all over the southwest and northwest, and climbing over high mountains and deep valleys!</p>
<p>This exploration team joined forces with the people drawn by Chai Dengbang from the Huainan Mining Bureau, and traced the area from Caijiagang and Shanshanji past Lijia'ao. To the edge of the Huainan basin, which is separated by the Huai River. Of course, the riverbed would have eroded and separated the coal-bearing area to the north bank of the Huai River. For this reason, the Xie-Chai exploration team crossed the Huai River and wandered on the hills between Dadingjiashan and Xinzhuangzi, near the Qianjia Lake on the north bank. Drilling to explore the extension of the coal seam need not be too deep, stopping after hitting the first layer. The new boreholes for exploring the extension of the ore layer are centered on the first borehole in Xinzhuangzi, with boreholes drilled at distances of 400 meters to the southeast and 500 meters to the north and west around it. Judging from the geological topography of Xinzhuangzi, the extension of the coal seam generally runs from northwest to southeast. Therefore, it is proposed to drill to explore the extension of the coal seam within a length of 5,500 meters from northwest to southeast, with Xinzhuangzi as the midpoint (the extension of the Huainan coal seam is ten kilometers, or 10,000 meters). First, drill one borehole each in front of and behind Xinzhuangzi. The fourth borehole is planned to be drilled on the north bank of Qianjia Lake. After this decision, Xie Jiarong went to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Discovery of a New Coal Seam</p>
<p>When the reporter visited the Huainan Mining Bureau in November, the air by the Huai River was already wintry. Chai Dengbang showed me the similarities and differences between the new coal mine in Xinzhuangzi and the geology of the Huainan coal system in his home. The Huainan coal system has an inclination of over 80 degrees, while the Xinzhuangzi only has an inclination of 30 degrees. A smaller inclination means lower mining costs, so the economic value of the new mining area is greater.</p>
<p>Regarding the reserves of the new coal seam in Xinzhuangzi, he cautiously told me a formula for calculating reserves. The formula is:</p>
<p>Coal seam thickness × extension × depth × specific gravity = reserves.</p>
<p>Then, he assumed that the extension of the Xinzhuangzi coal seam is ten kilometers (10,000 meters) (the same as Huainan), the depth of an ordinary coal mine is 600 meters, the specific gravity is 1.2, and the thickness of the coal seam, according to the four layers of coal already drilled in Xinzhuangzi, is 6 meters. The numerical formula should be:</p>
<p>6 × 10,000 × 600 × 1.2 = 43,200,000 tons</p>
<p>43.2 million tons of bituminous coal. This is naturally a considerable figure, but this figure only accounts for 1/5000th of the 190 million tons of bituminous coal reserves listed in Xie Jiarong's national important mineral distribution map (Huainan coal has no position on Xie's map). Nevertheless, this known new mineral source is both easily accessible and served by a complete set of experienced miners, so the opening of this new _ is inevitable.</p>
<p>Chai Dengbang said that the preliminary exploration of the coal seam thickness will be completed in the spring of 1947.</p>
<p>The extension of the coal seam will be explored by the end of 1947.</p>
<p>Mining is planned to begin in the spring of 1948.</p>
<p>This is the story of the Xinzhuangzi mining exploration that occurred in the Huainan mining area after August this year. The entire exploration team lived in tents and worked in the wild for 30 days, and will continue to work for a long time. This situation is like a small team living through a war. This period of life is precisely the beginning of the growth of the future new Huainan mine. In addition to this new Xinzhuangzi mining area, Chai Deng _ and Xie Jiarong are also planning to go to Pingyishan (_ far from the junction with Fengtai, the northernmost edge of the _ Nan Basin) to see the geology. Therefore, the Huainan Wax Railway Bureau has set a one-year exploration plan with the Resources Committee, which will naturally lead to a new mining area: perhaps in three years, the new mining area will have hoisting frames and tall chimneys spewing thick black smoke, and workers will be as lively going up and down the mines in Jiulonggang and Datong as they are today. At that time, these two geological experts, Xie Jiarong and Chai Dengbang, who apply the principles of geology and their own rich experience everywhere, may be braving the cold and stepping on ice and snow in the Northeast or other regions. But today, when I am writing the story of the Huainan mining area, I cannot help but emphasize the contributions of these two people!</p>
<p>Remember: Xinzhuangzi, Fengtai County, Anhui Province, a new coal mine with possible reserves of over 40 million tons, was explored and identified in 1946, amid the chaos of China, by two geological experts, Xie Jiarong and Chai Dengbang, and their exploration team, with the support of the Resources Committee and the Huainan Mining Bureau! This is the beginning of the new mining area's decades of life. Don't forget these two scientists!</p>
<h3>The Xie-Chai Exploration Team Crossed the North Bank of the Huai River: Limestone is a Needle</h3>
<p>In September, one day, the exploration team found _ _ insect limestone under the topsoil in Xinzhuangzi.</p>
<p>_ _ insect limestone is like a needle. The exploration team stopped to study it. In Jiulonggang and Datong, the coal seam is covered under the topsoil north of the _ _ insect limestone (Mount Shungeng is south of the Jiulonggang Datong mining area). Then, northeast of Xinzhuangzi, under the topsoil, the coal-bearing stratum of the Huainan coal system, which has been cut by the Huai River bed, must be found.</p>
<p>When Xie Jiarong brought the exploration team to the Huainan mining area, he also brought the Liggen-style 150 to 250 drill, which he often used from the Resources Committee. They felt that they had already found the coal-bearing stratum of the Huainan coal system on the north bank of the Huai River, but the thickness of the coal seam of this coal system is an important condition for determining whether mining will be profitable in the future. Xie and Chai decided to use a drill to drill the first borehole 200 meters east of Xinzhuangzi in order to explore the thickness of the coal seam.</p>
<p>On September 30, the drill entered the soil, with the intention to drill the borehole to a depth of 150 meters. For an entire month, when the Liggen-style drill had drilled to a depth of 120 meters underground, the magneto generator in the iron _ broke down, and it had to be stopped on October 29. However, the thickness record of the coal-bearing stratum at a depth of 120 meters that had already been explored rewarded the exploration team and its leaders Xie and Chai with great joy. The record is:</p>
<p>The first layer of coal was seen from 19.4 meters to 23 meters, with a coal thickness of over 3 meters.</p>
<p>The second layer of coal was seen from 62.3 meters to 63.2 meters, with a coal thickness of 0.62 meters.</p>
<p>The third layer of coal was seen from 65.42 meters to 66.05 meters, with a coal thickness of 0.52 meters.</p>
<p>The fourth layer of coal was seen from 67.24 meters to 78.47 meters, with a coal thickness of 1.85 meters.</p>
<p>Four layers of coal appeared in the 120-meter-deep borehole, with the first layer reaching a thickness of one zhang and the fourth layer reaching a thickness of over five chi, both above the height of a person. This rich thick coal seam determines that the mining of this new coal deposit can be very profitable (economic value is available). Even if there are no more thick coal seams below 120 meters, this coal-bearing stratum is already valuable enough, but the planned drilling to 150 meters must be done. Xie Jiarong returned to Nanjing to sort out other business and sent someone to Shanghai to buy a new magneto generator for continued exploration.</p>
<p>Just before Xie Jiarong returned to Nanjing, he and Chai Dengbang agreed on the next step: exploring the extension of the coal seam.</p>
<h3>Signs of Construction on the Xisha Islands</h3>
<p>The Xisha Islands are located in the northern part of the South China Sea, 180 li northwest of Yulin Port on Hainan Island, 360 li northeast of the Pearl River Estuary in Guangzhou, 250 li west of Nantolun, and 540 li east of Manila in the Philippines. The situation is dangerous and is our country's gateway to Nanyang.</p>
<p>The sovereignty of the Xisha Islands belongs to our country, which is an undoubted fact, seen in historical books and gazetteers of past dynasties. The Sino-French Boundary Survey Treaty of 1887 also clearly pointed out that the islands belong to our country. Currently, our government has recovered the islands from the Japanese army and should strive to build and develop resources to consolidate Nanyang's national defense and promote international shipping. The following four pictures are enough to show a glimpse of the construction remains on the Xisha Islands.</p>

<h3>Alliance Leader Jailed, the Tree Falls and the Monkeys Scatter: Wang Huisheng Forms a "Party," the Shortest-Lived Party in History: Dies After Ten Months</h3>
<p>— Kunming Dispatch on the 6th, Special Correspondent Xu Jilian</p>
<p>This can also be considered a "party" - the "China Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance." Its rise in Kunming was indeed a sensation for a time, but its decline was unexpectedly rapid.</p>
<p>Speaking of the rise and fall of the "China Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance," it really evokes a sense of the vicissitudes of life. It was formally established in March 1946, but announced its demise in January of this year. Including the beginning and the end, it didn't even last a year, which is probably the shortest lifespan in modern party history.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Alliance Leader, _ This Horse Has a Big Background</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A snake cannot move without a head." To introduce the "China Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance," we naturally cannot ignore their "Alliance Leader." It's really "Speaking of This Horse, It Has a Big Background." The three words Wang Huisheng were a sensation in half of the mountain city for a time. In terms of military rank, he was a graduate of the first class of Huangpu Military Academy. In terms of official rank, he was once a two-star general. He was born in a small county in Guizhou. He had an impressive appearance, somewhat of a scholar's temperament, but with a weathered face, one could tell that he had been worn down by years of restless life!</p>
<p>As the leader of an alliance, he naturally had his unique strengths. At a glance, behind his tortoise shell glasses, two eyes radiated light. It goes without saying that he was capable, and he was also good at socializing, often making a stranger feel as familiar as an old friend. His voice was always so loud, with plenty of energy, and he was eloquent. He was very impatient. During the Northern Expedition, he served as a company commander, leading a valiant force, speeding between Fujian and Guangdong.</p>
<p>Wang Huisheng really "cannot bear to look back and talk about those years." In recent years, he had indeed been unable to realize his ambitions. He had no soldiers under his command, no power in his hands, and things were getting worse and worse. Therefore, "when one is poor, one must change; change leads to progress." When there was no way out, Wang Huisheng had a brilliant idea and organized the "China Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance."</p>
<p>Gang Members and Brothers Flock to Join</p>
<p>The alliance headquarters was located in the Kunming City Federation of Trade Unions. For a time, gang members and brothers flocked to join, and the momentum was quite impressive. The alliance had departments and offices, and appointment letters were flying everywhere. Officials, heads of departments, and section chiefs were as numerous as "crucian carp crossing the river." And some dismissed soldiers and idle _ _, were also willing to have such a place to settle down. The signboard could scare people.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the headquarters was not meticulous. In the center hall hung the words "Democracy and Freedom," personally inscribed by a certain general. At the time, this calligraphy could be regarded as a talisman. Many people regarded this place as a "mysterious valley."</p>
<p>Then they elected the executive directors and supervisors, and formally swore an oath of office, declaring that branch offices would be established in provinces such as Xikang and Sichuan. They claimed that the alliance members had reached more than 200,000 people. Their "alliance network" was "for the country and the people." The alliance flag was very unique, triangular, apricot yellow, and painted with a golden sun emblem. This bright symbol appeared once during a _ Shame National Humiliation Propaganda Week. On that occasion, a winding column of their members paraded through the entire city of Kunming in an unprecedented grand march.</p>
<p>Economic Problems: The Alliance Leader Finds a Way Out</p>
<p>It is really difficult for a nation without an economic foundation to start anew and open up a new path. Therefore, Wang Huisheng was very anxious. Although he tried to build relationships and find connections, it was ultimately a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>I remember once he ran to the Kunming Garrison Commander Guan Linzheng, opened the door, and began to speak loudly, "Lao Guan! Take out some money to spend!" The Garrison Commander had no choice but to respond, and finally took out his wallet and gave him a certain amount, but how could sand and gravel fill the rivers and seas? Naturally, Brother Wang had to find another way!</p>
<p>Some people began to suspect their actions. However, Wang Huisheng had already left the Huangpu system, and he did not have much of a relationship with the Kuomintang in history. Therefore, outsiders could only wait and see what would happen.</p>
<p>Loaded with Guns and Ammunition, Heading Straight for Zhaotong</p>
<p>In September 1946, the Alliance Leader Wang Kensheng faced their economic crisis. Therefore, he had no time to take care of many of his brothers. He personally drove a GMC car, fully loaded with guns, ammunition, and soldiers, carrying the banner of the "Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance," and flying the triangular apricot yellow flag, marching mightily towards Zhaotong (a large county in eastern Yunnan, the hometown of former Provincial Chairman Long Yun). Not to mention others, even the inspectors along the road could not figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>On the _ Dong Road, dust billowed and passage was unimpeded. Upon arrival at the edge of Zhaotong City, they stopped for inspection at the border. Wang _ Sheng took out the permit from the Garrison Headquarters, claiming to be the _ Leader of the "Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance," coming with great momentum, and no one could do anything about it!</p>
<p>That night, a new agency appeared in Zhaotong City, with guards standing at the door, fully armed, looking quite mighty. Moreover, the streets of Zhaotong were full of fully equipped armed soldiers. As a result, the local commissioner's office had to use their brains. Wang _ Sheng was also unlucky. At the same time, the Zhaotong Security Corps happened to receive a telegram from the Kunming Garrison Headquarters ordering the arrest of Wang Huisheng. So, after careful arrangement, the power plant first sounded the alarm. As a result, Wang Huisheng did not expect it and had to surrender and be arrested.</p>
<p>Following the arrest, Wang Huisheng was escorted back to Kunming. "The tree falls and the _ _ scatter." Without waiting for a formal dissolution order, the "Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance" had already collapsed. The "alliance members" changed their plans and looked for other ways out. The Garrison Headquarters, together with the city government and police bureau, sealed up the headquarters and seized printed matter and documents.</p>
<p>After several interrogations by the Security Command, Wang Huisheng was sentenced to ten years in prison for the crimes of forming a party for personal gain and plotting without fighting and was sent to the Yunnan First Prison, one person in a separate room, which seemed very comfortable.</p>
<p>It is said that Wang Huisheng's motivation for going to Zhaotong was purely commercial in nature and had no other political purpose. He did not expect to become a prisoner as soon as he arrived. No wonder Wang Huisheng once said to reporters: "Don't judge heroes by success or failure. This is my fate!" His tone was straightforward and quite heroic. Furthermore, there were many people among the alliance members who wanted to use this organization to engage in legitimate political activities. However, unfortunately, the leader was incompetent, and coupled with indecision, impetuosity, and arrogance, he suffered defeat and infamy, ending up in such a miserable end!</p>
<h3>New Scene in the World Marriage Market: Difficult to Marry, Many Divorces: Engagements are Also Rare</h3>
<p>— Berlin Dispatch on the 3rd, Special Correspondent Hong Fu</p>
<p>Recalling ninety years ago, in the early years of the Tongzhi reign in our country, the people who returned after fleeing the floods of war, were full of food and warm clothing, living cheaply, and still enjoying twenty or thirty years of peace. Now it is not the same. In the new era, after the war, food shortages and money shortages have even caused panic in the marriage market, which is by no means what our ancestors dreamed of.</p>
<p>Former Brazilian President _ Chooses a Son-in-Law for His Daughter</p>
<p>Western women have long suffered from "difficulty in marrying." The United States is a paradise for women, but life in big cities is not as peaceful as in the countryside. The youth of most women, those with intelligence and beauty, are like the stars in China's music scene and theaters, flowing like water, allowing them to fade away. Those below this level are even more unbearable. South American culture is not as advanced as North America, but the difficulty of getting married is very similar. In the past, when I traveled to South America, I personally saw the four daughters of the late former President of Brazil, all of whom possessed precious gardens and villas, with large assets, brilliant reputations, and dignified manners, determined to choose a son-in-law. Unfortunately, no one asked, which was spread as a good story in diplomatic circles. When they arrived in Eastern Europe, the wounds had not yet recovered. From Austria-Hungary to the Balkan Peninsula countries, due to the impact of the First European War, there were more women than men, and men were greedy for temporary pleasure and avoided the obligations of formal couples. What women pursue, either material or spiritual, has already satisfied the other party's desires. The comfort that women have exchanged at a great price is only up to the "engagement" stage.</p>
<p>Today, German Women Feel the Suffering of Being Too Many</p>
<p>Western women's habits now often regard accepting a man's proposal as the most difficult to obtain "honor" in their lives. Germany is a war-loving country, and most of the men died in the war. To this day, women are increasingly suffering from being too many. Berlin is the capital of Germany. According to a survey in 1946, there were 192,000 unmarried young women between the ages of 20 and 30, while there were only 71,000 young men of the same age. The number of female citizens is almost three times that of men. What is even more strange is that divorces are increasing, and engagements are simply not to be seen. Therefore, the "honor" of women accepting a man's proposal has become a "dream" in Beijing, Germany.</p>
<p>The Number of Illegal Illegitimate Children Continues to Increase</p>
<p>The number of illegal illegitimate children in Germany is increasing secretly. This is because the first demand of women is to find a satisfactory husband, and the second is still to have a child. If they cannot "get a husband" now, they will take a step back and seek to "get a child." The family life of new German women no longer has a coexisting man, and the status of men in Germany is quite similar to that of the Chinese _ in the old era, only relying on "making children." The relationship between men and women in Germany is equivalent to the style of concubinage in the old era of China, secretly creating a "poly-gamy" style of polygamy. In addition, occupational competition, most of the positions are already occupied by women, unwilling to give way to men, and conflicts with each other, all of which are enough to cause concern for the community and society. This shows that the harm of warmongering is great and profound. Representatives of our country who advocate women's rights and protect public welfare, if they can take a step back like Sweden and Switzerland to protect their country's neutrality and maintain peace, and take a step forward like the British who are fond of peace and do not like war, all good hopes can be achieved in the end. This is the fundamental plan, not the followers of those who treat the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt, talking about trivial matters.</p>
<h3>Pig Head Tax Becomes Corrupted, Actually Becomes Poll Tax</h3>
<p>— Sixth of the Month Nanchang Airmail, Our Newspaper Nanchang Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>After the fiscal reform in this province, the county-level finances have land tax and business tax, each accounting for 50 percent, slaughter tax, business license tax, usage license tax, house tax, feast and entertainment tax, deed tax, and property return tax. All of the land value increment tax, and the income from public property reorganization, if various taxes are properly organized, and every bit goes to the public, the expenses of the county government and its affiliated agencies should not have any major difficulties. However, the current financial distress of the county government has reached the point of utter destitution. The Magistrate of Xingzi County went to his post without rice to cook; the first major task after taking office was to borrow thirty catties of rice to start the meals. The Magistrate of Dean County arrived at his post to find the county treasury completely empty, not a single grain. In many counties, the treasury has no money and the accounting books are blank.</p>
<p>Currently, county-level finances rely entirely on slaughter tax. They eat slaughter tax, wear slaughter tax, and use slaughter tax. Elementary school teachers, on the one hand, teach, and on the other hand, have to collect slaughter tax themselves. I met many county-level public educators who could readily pull out a large handful of slaughter tax tickets from their pockets, because they are not easy to collect, and they have to treat them as legal tender and carefully preserve them. Currently, the slaughter tax, according to the provincial government's regulations, is collected at 5% of the price. Before November, the weight of each pig was stipulated to be 150 catties. Now they have become "fat and strong to 200 catties," but the methods of collecting slaughter tax are full of tricks, each with its own merits.</p>
<p>The methods of collecting slaughter tax, in addition to the county government's security police, police局, and the armed police in township offices going door-to-door to collect it, involve the allocation and collection of tax amounts by:</p>
<p>(1) Direct apportionment by the county government to each township.</p>
<p>(2) "Explicitly entrust, secretly contract out" by the county government.</p>
<p>(3) Handling by the township offices, which submit it to the county government for unified collection and expenditure.</p>
<p>(4) Handling by the township offices to cover township expenses, without reporting to the county, nor requesting funds from the county government.</p>
<p>(5) Undertaking by township representatives.</p>
<p>How is the Jiangxi slaughter tax, collected under these diverse methods, apportioned to the common people? The sound policy of taxing according to the head of the animal has become a "poll tax." In reality, it is the poor farmers who raise pigs and the butchers who sell meat who pay the tax, while those who eat pork do not bear the obligation to pay the tax. Moreover, sometimes a pig has to bear double taxation (pigs from Village A have already paid the live pig tax, but if they are sold to Village B for slaughter, they have to pay an "exit slaughter tax"). These are the apportionment methods:</p>
<p>(1) The monthly slaughter tax quota for Anyi County is now 9,750 heads (previously 7,200 heads). The township offices allocate the quota to each bảo according to the population of each township. The county's current population is 66,685 people, 11,253 households. The monthly slaughter tax is apportioned at nearly one pig per household. According to provincial government regulations, each pig weighs 200 catties, and the market price per catty is calculated at 1,000 yuan, the tax levied is 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) In Anfu County, sows, piglets, and pigs being raised must all pay tax monthly, at 1,500 yuan per head per month.</p>
<p>(3) The slaughter tax in Fengxin is collected and disbursed uniformly by the county government on the orders of each township, which is considered a relatively legal method.</p>
<p>(4) The slaughter tax in Yongxiu County is also apportioned by township. Aicheng Town (i.e., the urban area) is charged five times the amount, and each township is charged double the county's quota. The bảo then charges double the township's quota. The township and bảo personnel then come up with a new trick, claiming "insufficient quota" and also collecting sow tax, piglet tax, and fines for not raising pigs. The tax rate for live pigs is based on the pig's weight, estimated by the collectors, and slaughter tax of 5 to 10 yuan per catty is paid.</p>
<p>(5) The slaughter tax in Dean County is both apportioned and collected, and the tax rate for live pigs has already risen to 100 yuan per head.</p>
<p>(6) The slaughter tax in Xingzi County is not only a pig head tax but also a "poll tax." Whether one raises pigs or not, the slaughter tax is uniformly apportioned and collected.</p>
<p>(7) A township office in Jiujiang has a monthly budget of 210,000 yuan, and the monthly slaughter tax quota is 45 heads. Calculating at 200 catties per pig, the slaughter tax collected is 450,000 yuan. This tax is neither remitted to the county, nor does the county government urge its collection.</p>
<p>If we look at the actual collected statistics of slaughter tax from the entire Jiangxi Province, those who do not understand the truth will surely suspect that the Jiangxi people eat the most pork in the province, while at the same time they are sallow-faced and malnourished!</p>

<h3>Public Buses Please Improve Quickly</h3>
<p>Editor: The red No. 22 public buses running in this city are convenient for citizens, and the ticket sellers are conscientious in selling tickets and never cheat, which is commendable. However, this route's public buses still have a drawback, that is, the ticket sellers ring the bell and start the bus before the passengers have fully boarded, regardless of whether there are few passengers or crowded conditions, causing many passengers to climb on when the bus is already moving. At this time, the bus door is not closed, and passengers are often in danger of falling, especially women and children. For example, on the 20th of last month, a passenger fell from the bus at Zhengjia Muqiao, fortunately not fatally. In the past, Shanghai newspapers often reported on this matter, but it has not attracted the attention of the Public Utility Bureau and company authorities to improve it. Therefore, I implore your esteemed newspaper to expose it in a corner, in order to urge the authorities to correct it. (Shen Sikang)</p>
<p>The 54, 52, and 23 trains departing from Shanghai Station, when stopped at the station, the lights inside the carriages can be said to be completely absent. Passengers must grope in the dark. This is a good opportunity for pickpockets to show their skills. Every time I go out, I hear people losing things, especially the 51 train from Nanjing and the 62 train from Hangzhou. The sky is already dark when they are halfway there, but the lights in the carriages are never turned on. At every small station without electric lights, passengers squeeze on and off in the dark, and pickpockets are rampant. The "Four Famous Mountains" and other theft cases published in the daily newspapers show the rampant theft on trains. Please the road bureau to rectify the carriage lights, which is also a good way to prevent pickpockets. (Wang Deren)</p>
<h3>Guangxi's Mouth of Respiration: Wuzhou</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Wuzhou, 4th of the Month by Airmail</p>
<p>As spring arrives, and the pepper flowers are lightly praised, during the time of slightly drunken Tusu wine, by chance, I went to the West River and drifted to this gateway of Guangxi again.</p>
<p>From Guilin to Wuzhou, from northern Guangxi to eastern Guangxi, is a long journey. The reporter sat on the Guiliu section train, which had only been open for five days, comfortable and quiet, incomparably better than the noisy and chaotic Yuehan Road. Then, from Liuzhou, I took a car, enduring the "cloud-driving and fog-riding" misery on the highway, returning to the former residence of the Wing King, and then letting the 18th-century wooden boat tow me to Wuzhou.</p>
<p>After thirteen years of separation, the scenery of Wuzhou remains vaguely similar. Baixue Mountain stores endless river flows, morning after morning, and evening after evening, not knowing how many incoming and outgoing travelers have been sent off. Stepping onto the long embankment, looking around, it is another scene of ruined walls. Taking a closer look, it is truly "every room is broken, no house is undamaged." Each of the four major cities in Guangxi is like this, how much can one feel?</p>
<p>One Restaurant Every Step, One Teahouse Every Five Steps</p>
<p>However, Wuzhou is, after all, the mouth of respiration for Guangxi. Millions of goods roll in and out, how can one calculate it? It is said that the daily value of goods in and out totals nine figures. On the river, there are boats coming and going, bustling and difficult to count. Due to the prosperity of commerce, firms stand in rows, and food and drink are everywhere. People say that food is in Guangzhou, but with the population of Wuzhou as a proportion, I dare guarantee that the number of restaurants in Guangzhou is less than in Wuzhou. Belly-drumming merchants have money and gold bars. Naturally, they indulge in joy. Therefore, Wuzhou has good fortune in clothing and food. One restaurant every step, one teahouse every five steps, from Hedi Road straight through Danan Road to Nanhuan Road, it is all like this. Every night is the Lantern Festival, the lively scene is beyond description compared to the desolate scene of Guilin's shops closing at eight o'clock. A dilapidated building is covered with weeds, and under the weeds is a teahouse. Where else can one find such a style of Cangwu?</p>
<p>Goods Prices Rise Step by Step, Adventurers Laugh</p>
<p>Convenient transportation is the main reason for Wuzhou's liveliness. From Guangzhou, it takes two days to reach, and goods go directly to Guixian and Nanning, selling throughout the province, taking no more than three to five days. Eight or nine out of ten imported goods cannot escape the "Made in U.S.A." label, while exports are mainly mountain products, livestock, and fennel oil. Among them, checkpoints and customs lead to rising prices. A tube of toothpaste sells for 700 yuan in Wuzhou, 1,000 yuan in Liuzhou, and 1,200 yuan in Guilin. Although this big gate has a broken door frame and a collapsed threshold, the inside and outside of the gate seem to be filled with dazzling gold and silver, arousing the interest of adventurers, who are busy coming in and rushing out, enjoying themselves!</p>
<p>Many People, Narrow Streets, Cars Cannot Enter the City</p>
<p>Wuzhou's streets are built against the mountains and by the water, extremely narrow. The roads are even smaller than the sidewalks in Nanjing. There are many people and the roads are narrow, packed tightly, much like Hankou's Hualou Street. Fortunately, due to the separation of the two rivers, cars cannot cross the river and can only stop in the opposite Rongcheng, unable to enter the city. (There has never been a car in Wuzhou, not even a rickshaw.) Otherwise, I really don't know what to do!</p>
<p>Culture Too Barren, Chicken Ribs Fill the Hungry Stomach</p>
<p>The business scene talks about business. In Wuzhou, if you want to buy a decent book, sometimes you seem to have a sigh of "rising to heaven and entering the earth, both places are vast and boundless." There may be one or two bookstores, but they sell textbooks or magazines from before December. The book stalls are even more barren than the abandoned airport across the river. The reporter has traveled all over Guangxi, east, west, north, and south, and the situation is the same everywhere, and cannot help but sigh for Guangxi's culture! The local newspaper is only the Wuzhou Daily, with dull layout and content like chicken ribs. Moreover, because the citizens only like Guangzhou newspapers' "Lianxiang Ji", "Remember the Person Before You", and "Strange Articles", they don't understand anything else, so the circulation is also quite poor.</p>
<p>Coming and going in a hurry, three days of lodging, I don't know if Wuzhou dislikes me or I dislike Wuzhou, I simply don't want to stay for another moment. While I am scribbling quickly, the guest in the left room is laughing loudly with a prostitute, the guest in the right room is talking loudly about "transporting salt to Shaoguan to make money." The guest in the opposite room is pulling the blind singer, singing the Cantonese tune of "Sadness and sorrow, melancholy intention..." It seems that everything is in rebellion. Countless maggots have revealed their true forms in the land of happiness.</p>

<h3>Before Attending the Meeting</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>Section Chief Shi was sitting alone at his desk in the study, holding a Seven-Wolf Three-Goat hair brush in one hand and a cigarette in the other, writing his speech:</p>
<p>"We have now reached the atomic age, and everything must be mechanized, but our transportation is still using rickshaws. This is not only lagging behind the times, but also simply violating human rights! Rickshaw pullers..."</p>
<p>He wrote to this point, preparing to describe the suffering of rickshaw pullers as much as possible, but who usually pays attention to their suffering? He had to put the pen on the pen rest, the cigarette stuck to his lips, his hands in his sleeves, his eyes fixed on the green-shaded desk lamp in front of him, trying hard to think.</p>
<p>The ash on the cigarette had accumulated an inch, but he still hadn't thought of anything. He took the cigarette off, flicked off the ash, and then extended a finger that had been yellowed by the cigarette smoke, pressing the call bell:</p>
<p>"Ding..."</p>
<p>A chubby maid ran in:</p>
<p>"Section Chief, what's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Go and find Axi!"</p>
<p>"Yes!" The maid retreated.</p>
<p>Next to walk in was Axi, the rickshaw puller. He was wearing a broken cotton robe, a blue cloth belt tied around his waist, the hem of the robe tucked inside, the collar open, and a broken woolen cap tilted on his forehead. He was quite tall, with a slight hunchback, and many wrinkles on his face. Looking at him, you would think he was in his twenties or thirties, but in reality, he was only seventeen years old. Perhaps fearing that people would think he was too young, he now reported his age three years older.</p>
<p>"I have a few questions to ask you!" Section Chief Shi gently turned the swivel chair under his bottom, facing Axi, who was standing straight. His tone was very gentle, never so gentle before.</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!" Axi was a little flattered.</p>
<p>"How old are you this year?"</p>
<p>"Te... oh! Twenty!"</p>
<p>"Oh, only twenty years old!" Section Chief Shi expressed surprise at that rather old face: "How many years have you been pulling a rickshaw?" "I've been pulling for two years. I used to pull casual rickshaws, but I've only been a full-time rickshaw puller for the past two months!"</p>
<p>"How much does the government pay you a month?"</p>
<p>"Sixty thousand yuan."</p>
<p>"Is that enough?" Section Chief Shi took a puff of his cigarette.</p>
<p>"How could that be enough? I wear out a pair of shoes a month, costing twenty thousand yuan. The remaining forty thousand yuan has to support three people. Even if I grind the money into powder, it's still not enough!"</p>
<p>"Oh, who is in your family?" "There's my elderly mother and a younger sister!"</p>
<p>"Don't you have a father?"</p>
<p>"Father?" Axi paused, choking up: "He was also a rickshaw puller, but one day, he injured himself in a fall, coughed up blood for several months, and he... died!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" Section Chief Shi turned the chair back to its original position: "You can go!"</p>
<p>Axi left, feeling inexplicably confused.</p>
<p>Section Chief Shi found the material in Axi's mouth. He wrote about the life of rickshaw pullers as painfully as cattle and horses. The conclusion was that the phenomenon of people pulling people must disappear forever.</p>
<p>After he finished his speech, he looked in the mirror and practiced it in advance. His eyeballs bulged, and his large mouth emitted hot air. When he spoke passionately, he made loud noises, waking up his sleeping wife and children in the next room.</p>
<p>Every day was the same. At eight o'clock, Axi pulled the rickshaw to send the young master and young lady to school, and then pulled the wife to the small market. After returning, around ten o'clock, he would send Section Chief Shi to the county government office.</p>
<p>But today's situation was a little different. When he pulled his wife back from the small market, Section Chief Shi was anxiously losing his temper at the gate.</p>
<p>"You're ruining my business, ruining my business!"</p>
<p>"Aren't you supposed to go to the office at ten o'clock every day?" his wife replied.</p>
<p>"Don't you know there's a meeting at nine o'clock? I have to go and give a speech!" Saying that, Section Chief Shi jumped into the rickshaw: "Pull quickly!"</p>
<p>A shiny black rickshaw, Section Chief Shi sat on it, wearing a leather hat, his neck shrunk into the collar of his leather coat, his right leg crossed over his left leg, revealing the shiny leather tips of his shoes.</p>
<p>Axi, breathing heavily and sweating, pulled quickly, running. The red and green chicken feather dusters inserted on the rickshaw were dancing.</p>
<p>"Faster! Pull faster! You're really useless!" Section Chief Shi was still dissatisfied, stepping on the foot bell and shouting. Axi desperately charged forward.</p>
<p>Section Chief Shi could already see from afar a cloth banner hanging in front of the county government: "Symposium on Abolishing Rickshaws." He coughed twice, cleared his throat, preparing to make shocking remarks at the symposium. But what he didn't know was that Axi, because he had run so many roads on an empty stomach, felt exhausted. Suddenly, he felt a burst of dizziness, his legs weakened, and he fell to the ground. The rickshaw and the person on it also fell down.</p>
<p>"Useless thing! Useless thing! Rickshaws must be abolished quickly! Must be abolished!..." Section Chief Shi, while scolding, climbed up, raised the shiny leather tip of his shoe, and kicked Axi's body hatefully.</p>
<p>As a result, Axi still struggled to get up, pulling Section Chief Shi into the county government gate.</p>
<h3>Warm Respect</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>Dickens once said that the warmest respect for his work was what he encountered one day when he passed through New York. At that time, an unknown woman recognized the great writer, reached out her hand, and said, "Mr. Dickens, would you be willing to let me shake the hand that has filled my home with so many good friends?"</p>
<h3>Beasts Bearing Heavy Loads</h3>
<p>— Written by Mao Heng, Translated by Meng Nong</p>
<p>When you first see coolies carrying heavy loads on the road, you will find it a pleasing sight. They wear tattered blue shirts, either indigo bronze, or jade green, or milky yellow, extremely harmonious and contrasting with the natural scenery. When they walk along the rice paddy ridges or climb the green mountains in front of them, they seem to be walking very vigorously. They wear only a short shirt and trousers. Even if they initially wear a complete new garment, when it needs to be patched, they will never bother to choose a piece of cloth of the same color to repair it. They patch with whatever they have on hand. Regardless of sunny or rainy days, they always wear an old straw hat with a particularly wide and flat brim - a straw hat like a lampshade.</p>
<p>You can also see a line of coolies, marching one after another, each with a carrying pole on their shoulders, two large packages hanging from each end of the pole, forming a beautiful pattern. It is very interesting to see their reflections as they quickly wade through the water. When they pass before your eyes, you might as well carefully examine their faces. As long as you have not been instilled with the preconceived notion that the East is mysterious, then you must have said that their faces are kind and sincere. When you see them put down their heavy burdens and lie down beside the cool pavilion under the banyan tree, smoking or chatting happily, if you try to mention that they carry large packages for about a hundred li a day, you will naturally be shocked by their strong patience and excellent energy. But if you tell the Chinese people about your feelings, they will think it's not worth laughing at. They will also shrug their shoulders and tell you: coolies are just like livestock, and fathers pass it on to sons, and sons pass it on to grandsons. For two thousand years, they have been carrying heavy things without any change. Therefore, they are happy to do this thing, and it is not surprising. Indeed, you can see that they start doing this thing when they are young. You will meet young children, with a heavy pole on their shoulders, carrying heavy vegetable baskets, staggering by.</p>
<p>Years pass like flowing water, and the weather gradually warms up. The coolies take off their short shirts, baring their upper bodies and beginning to appear before people. Sometimes, he rests for a while, his heavy burden has been put down, but his carrying pole is still placed on his shoulder, so he has to slightly hunch his back. At this time, you can see how urgently the poor, weak heart is beating against his ribs; as clearly as you see the condition of a heart patient in a hospital ward. Seeing this scene is sad enough. You might as well take another look at the backs of the coolies. Year after year, day after day, the heavy pressure of the carrying pole has pressed out red, hard marks, sometimes even pressed into cracked sores, pressed out large sores without any bandages or clothing, rubbed against bamboo heads and wood chips. The most peculiar thing is: sometimes, it seems that the creator intentionally adds to the harshness of their servitude. A malformed, protruding thing forms on the shoulder, like a camel hump, allowing the carrying pole to be placed there. Regardless of the heart's rapid beating, regardless of the swelling and pain of the sores, regardless of the invasion of torrential rain, regardless of the scorching heat of the sun, they always move forward forever and ever, from morning until night, from the beginning of the year until the end of the year, from childhood until old age. You can also see those old men, without even an ounce or two of fat on their bodies, their skin as loose as if it were detached from their bones, withered and dry, their small faces wrinkled like monkeys, and their hair showing sparse whiteness. They stagger forward, under heavy loads, toward the edge of the grave that will grant them rest after a long life. However, the coolies continue to move forward, not running, nor walking, but walking quickly, their eyes constantly looking at the ground while they take steps, hurrying on their way, their faces showing tense and hurried expressions. You can no longer form the pattern of them hurrying on their way. Their strenuous situation can make you feel a sense of oppression. You cannot help but be filled with a vague sympathy.</p>
<p>In China, beasts bearing heavy loads are people.</p>
<p>"Is it not too pitiful that those who have suffered the磨折of life and hurriedly pass their entire journey without being able to proceed slowly? Endless labor, unable to enjoy its fruits while alive, only exhausting one's life and suddenly passing away, and not knowing where one's destination is—is this not a cause of suffering?" So say the philosophers of Chinese mysticism.</p>

<h3>Scenery</h3>
<p>— De·Ke Kesui Kai</p>
<h3>Long Embankment</h3>
<p>— Lin Yongquan</p>
<p>A long canal flows beside a long embankment.</p>
<p>The long embankment guides the long canal, protecting it.</p>
<p>The long canal is like a soft, whip-like ribbon,</p>
<p>Quietly nestled beside the long embankment.</p>
<p>The long embankment is revealed by the tall forest,</p>
<p>The tall forest protects the long embankment.</p>
<p>The roots of the tall forest are intertwined with the soil of the long embankment,</p>
<p>Making the long embankment firmer, and the long canal more peaceful.</p>
<p>In spring, the canal water is clear and bright,</p>
<p>The long embankment is covered with blooming flowers and lush grass.</p>
<p>The canal water seeps deep into the embankment soil,</p>
<p>Nourishing the flowers and grass, nourishing the tall forest.</p>
<p>The slender figures of the tall trees are reflected in the canal water;</p>
<p>The beautiful faces of the flowers and grass are mirrored in the canal water;</p>
<p>The canal water holds a beautiful picture,</p>
<p>And the murmuring of the water echoes the songs of the birds.</p>
<p>Long paths stretch along the long embankment;</p>
<p>Countless lively birds flit about in the tall forest;</p>
<p>Many arched ancient stone bridges span the long canal;</p>
<p>How many silent travelers pass over the stone bridges in contemplation.</p>
<p>Come to the long embankment,</p>
<p>You skilled painters, come paint the sounds and sights,</p>
<p>You singers, come join the choir,</p>
<p>You silent ones, come sit by the stone bridge.</p>
<p>He trails the long shadows of the tall forest as he leaves,</p>
<p>He carries away the scores of the birds' songs,</p>
<p>She departs, her love fading sadly away,</p>
<p>The tall forest, the long embankment, and the long canal whisper secrets to each other.</p>
<h3>Palace Lanterns</h3>
<p>— Ke Ren</p>
<p>Those lanterns made with frames of Phoebe nanmu or bamboo, bound with deep red silk ribbons, with small and large glass panes on all four to eight sides, solemnly lit with red candles and hung up every year during the first month of the lunar new year, are called palace lanterns in my hometown.</p>
<p>Palace lanterns are different from wind lanterns, octagonal gauze lanterns, bright horn lanterns, wall lanterns, and such. Those are merely hung at the entrance of houses, on walls, and on ceilings, decorated with lacquered paper, gauze, or glass, serving both to embellish the holiday and to provide illumination. Palace lanterns, however, possess an air of elegance and wealth, and the significance of revering the gods and praying for blessings, and have always been properly hung in the main hall or living room.</p>
<p>Palace lanterns were originally items used in ancient imperial courts, but later the trend gradually spread to the common people. They entered the halls of wealthy families, and also the homes of common farmers with mud walls. Even in the thatched cottages of poor and helpless orphans and widows, they would occasionally settle without fear of appearing out of place. From then on, every family had palace lanterns; and the decoration of palace lanterns thus came to have differences in richness and simplicity. At the beginning of the year, the sight of the red glow of palace lanterns flickering on the corners of walls fills people's hearts with warmth and hope: This year's wheat will surely have full and ripe heads, and the youngest son will grow stronger and sturdier.</p>
<p>The crimson gauze or glass of the palace lanterns is often painted with popular folk stories from operas and novels that are well known to women and children, such as "Oath of the Peach Garden," "The Celestial Official Bestows Blessings," and "Magu Offers Longevity." Children always like red lanterns, and palace lanterns fascinate their childhood dreams. From a young age, they long for celestial officials, immortals, and heroes; although these dreams may eventually be shattered, even a passing thought of the impression palace lanterns made during childhood is still intimate and mysterious.</p>
<p>On nights with good moonlight, or when heavy snow falls and the fields are covered in silver, the red glow of the palace lanterns flickers, making them seem melancholic and mournful. I think of the aging, out-of-favor concubines in the imperial courts of feudal dynasties, and the countless palace women who wasted their youth, shedding tears in the moonlight, snowlight, and lamplight.</p>
<p>...I think.</p>
<p>What kind of times are we living in? I have, for no reason or purpose, brought up palace lanterns. My hometown probably no longer has families hanging and lighting palace lanterns. This is truly like "an old palace woman talking about the Kaiyuan Era," which is tiring and saddening.</p>
<h3>### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 177</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Coincidentally, just as we were about to finish studying the plan, and this small gathering was about to end, right when we were formally beginning preparations for the sudden attack, "04's" subordinate came in with two secret telegrams, one from Tokyo and one from Shenyang. Both telegrams were replies to Tsurumi regarding the "Eight" question: The strange thing was that the content of the telegram from Shenyang was much more detailed and comprehensive than "012's" from Tokyo:</p>
<p>"Secret, urgent. Pingzi is Pine Group Number Eight, Xianzi is Orchid Group Number Eight, also Fangzi is Special Group Number Eight, Xizi is Plum Group Number Eight. Xizi is currently undergoing training in Tokyo and will be transferred to Shanghai next month. Fangzi is in charge of South China. The secret of 'Eight' is unknown here, Pingzi is unapproachable, act 'reluctantly', Fan, 315."</p>
<p>After I announced the telegram, Mr. W and Yaoqun became highly interested and asked me with a smile, "How come there are so many 'Eights'?" Little Tiger wanted to laugh upon hearing this, but tried his best to imitate the demeanor of an adult and held back his laughter.</p>
<p>"There are many problems!" I replied casually. Then I briefly explained the 'Eight' issue that Tsurumi and I had researched and the process.</p>
<p>Mr. W added some opinions to what Tsurumi had made clear about the "eight secret advance stations." He said that the Japanese always , it is assumed that the real secret spy stations were near the British heart of London, and other military ports, Washington, D.C., and Panama in the United States, and Moscow in the Soviet Union, and so on.</p>
<p>Qun pondered for a while, and suddenly asked Tsurumi and us: "How many large-scale secret operation stations did the Japanese have in our country when they launched this war of aggression?"</p>
<p>Tsurumi seemed to have suddenly found a key to open a secret vault, and immediately jumped up, pulled out a map from under a pile of books on the table, and unfolded it, counting with his mouth, one, two,... drawing circles on it with a pencil:</p>
<p>"Hey, at least more than thirty large stations!" Tsurumi muttered to himself, as if he was saying it to us; but immediately shouted out as if he had discovered something secret, ... "Wait!" He also pulled out his handy almanac notebook, furrowed his brow, and carefully flipped through it.</p>
<p>I stood aside, silently observing Tsurumi's actions and expressions, analyzing his psychology. I saw that he had two different expressions at this time; one was innocent frankness, and the other was youthful competitiveness: when he unfolded the map, counting and circling, he was completely like a child—immediately revealing what he had gained. But at this time, seeing that Qun was about to come over to help, he immediately loudly since the mathematical problem was almost solved, he didn't want anyone to help because of his competitive nature.</p>
<p>Yaoqun also understood Tsurumi's psychological change at this time, so after hearing him , he immediately sat back in his original position; gazing at Tsurumi with a smile, waiting for his answer. From the thick smoke that was being exhaled in puffs, I saw the smile in the corner of Mr. W's eye.</p>
<p>"That's right!" Tsurumi's eyes were still fixed on the small notebook, and he spat out these two words. As he spoke, he continued to draw circles and count on the map, from one all the way to eight. After counting, he carefully considered it again, as if reconsidering it.</p>
<p>"Everyone come and see!" Tsurumi was still staring at the map: the tone of the shout was very much like a Shandong performer of Western-style shows; only missing a set of small gongs and cymbals.</p>
<p>"More than thirty small districts can be merged into eight large districts." Tsurumi showed us all the large and small circles on the map.</p>
<p>Except for the main station in Shenyang, Tsurumi drew a circle from Tianjin to Datong, Jinan as the center, which was considered the second circle; Taiyuan as the center of a circle, Wuhan as a circle, Shanghai-Nanjing as a circle, and the rest were Guangzhou, Kunming, Yichang, and other three circles, for a total of eight major districts. Explaining the reason for the zoning, Tsurumi also read out eight names from his notebook, who were the demons in charge of these eight major districts. With this comparison, we immediately believed that this discovery was precisely revealing the "secret of the Eight" from Pingzi's mouth. Only Mr. W, I pondered for a moment, and did not seem to believe it very thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Aunt Zhang, Daydreaming in the Kitchen</h3>
<p>— Zhuguang</p>
<p>Aunt Zhang, the young housewife who had just moved into the back wing, had come back from the vegetable market today as if possessed, staring blankly, simply daydreaming in the kitchen.</p>
<p>This world is truly going crazy. A few days ago, they said gold was rising, and the U.S. dollar was going up. These days, it should be stable, but daily necessities still refuse to fall in price.</p>
<p>The vegetable vendors in the vegetable market are all like they're possessed. Buying vegetables and meat from them is like not paying. The "rapacious" force of their anger is truly infuriating. They say that selling more means losing more, and that gold is about to reach ten million!</p>
<p>"Tofu is going to sell at the price of meat." In these days, tofu is practically selling at the price of gold. Usually, three to five thousand yuan could buy enough vegetables for three to five dishes, even if there wasn't much meat. Today, however, that's not the case—it's not even enough to buy a pound of meat.</p>
<p>Turning over the few vegetables spread thinly at the bottom of the basket, she repeatedly muttered the bustling market prices from the vegetable market just now:</p>
<p>Pork five thousand yuan per pound, ribbonfish two thousand yuan each, eggs three hundred and fifty, blood clams two thousand four, snails eight hundred yuan at the very least, even greens and bean sprouts have to be six hundred yuan per pound.</p>
<p>Not to mention the prices of oil, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, and salt, they are all the same. When gold was nine million five hundred thousand and white rice was one hundred and eighty thousand, a canteen meal was five hundred yuan, white sugar four thousand yuan, soybean oil three thousand two, but now gold and white rice have all fallen, but these things refuse to drop in price.</p>
<p>What makes our Aunt Zhang even more inexplicable is that the market price of fuel in these few days has not only not fallen with the price of gold, but has actually been rising. For example, coal briquettes, on the day (the day of the peak of gold and white rice) coal briquettes were twenty-five thousand per load, but today they have actually risen to thirty-three thousand, and coal, which was originally five hundred yuan per pound, has also doubled today. That day, kerosene jumped to one thousand two (per pound), and people were already surprised, but today it finally reached one thousand five.</p>
<p>Tingzi asked her sister-in-law, Lan, to come in with a smile, saying that cigarettes had fallen in price today, ten cigarettes of the Great Britain brand only sold for seven hundred yuan, and Qianmen (twenty cigarettes) for three thousand yuan. A few days ago, Great Britain was one thousand one, and Qianmen had to sell for four thousand and more. Tingzi Xian's sister-in-law squinted her eyes and smiled all the time, and also said: The American brand Lucky Strike used to sell for four thousand yuan, but today it is down to two thousand six.</p>
<p>But Aunt Zhang in the back wing is a non-smoker, so the price of cigarettes falling is irrelevant to her. She just looked at the green flame on the kerosene stove and smiled bitterly. (February 16th) She smiled bitterly at the green flame on the kerosene stove.</p>
<h3>Civil Servants Singing Praises of Benevolent Governance</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>In the past week or so, the alarming rise in gold, white rice, and essential daily necessities has caused extreme panic among the salaried class, especially civil servants who are not paid according to the "cost of living index," sitting in the office in mourning; "eyes reading the newspapers" and "ears listening to the news," each one is panicking!</p>
<p>Speaking of civil servants' salaries, after the adjustment in December last year, it was 170,000 yuan plus 1,100 times the increment. Taking a low salary of 100 yuan as an example, the total was 280,000 yuan. At that time, this could buy five loads of rice, but according to the current rice price, it can only buy two loads, and in effect a "40% discount" has been added.</p>
<p>Because of this, civil servants have been thrown into extreme "grief."</p>
<p>The government authorities plan to "distribute in-kind" to civil servants, including six items: rice, oil, coal, sugar, salt, and cloth. At the same time, civil servants' salaries will increase to 350,000 yuan as the base amount, and the basic number will increase to 1,300 times, according to the news published in this newspaper on the 15th.</p>
<p>When civil servants see these two pieces of "good news," they can't help but "jump for joy," praising benevolent governance.</p>
<p>But thinking about it carefully, another ripple of "feeling" arises. The things "allocated" to public school teachers in the past were of poor quality and not cheap, especially since the allocation price always followed the "black market soaring." Can these "worries" be clarified in the future?</p>

<h3>May My Hands Be Light and My Feet Strong, May a Hundred Diseases Never Approach - Wild Jumps in the Western Medicine Market - One Can't Afford to Get Sick, Ha Ha!</h3>
<p>— Zhu Guang</p>
<p>In this day and age, there is nothing more frightening than getting sick and taking medicine. Even if it is just a headache, a cold, or a minor ailment, if you want to recover quickly and seek relief from medicine, it will cost thousands or even tens of thousands of yuan, not to mention the doctor's consultation fee, let alone the bitter taste of the medicine, which is difficult to swallow!</p>
<p>During this gold rush, the prices that jumped the most fiercely were those of Western medicines. Not only was the increase rapid, but the prices were simply being shouted out randomly. There was no market, and the merchants holding the goods were like owners of "priceless treasures."</p>
<p>On the day that gold was quoted at nine million five hundred thousand and white rice rose to one hundred and eighty to ninety thousand, it was almost impossible to find even the most popular daily medicines, even at high prices. This scene was truly as if the end of the world had really arrived.</p>
<p>If anyone who had Bayer pharmaceutical factory products and new American medicines was willing to let go of the goods, then in a situation where "as long as Baby is willing to open his mouth," they were all snapped up, such as Bayer's Aspirin (ten tablets) fifteen thousand, Gardan (ten tablets) forty thousand, Crisalbine (per bottle) twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand, Black Lion 606 (per ampoule) fifty-five thousand to sixty thousand, Dolantin injection two hundred and eighty to three hundred thousand (per box). Other American medicines, such as Sulfathiazole (per thousand tablets) three hundred thousand, Sulfathiazole (per thousand tablets) one hundred and thirty to forty thousand, 606 per ampoule twelve thousand, Monsanto saccharin four hundred and seventy thousand per pound, and double peach quinine four hundred and fifty thousand. Being able to buy even some of the above items was considered "lucky" on that day.</p>
<p>Not only were foreign goods like this, but domestic new drugs were also like wild horses that had broken free of their reins, galloping madly. Taking several of the most common medicines used by ordinary citizens as an example, Universal Oil "big market" (per dozen) thirty-eight to thirty-nine thousand, retail sales when buying such a small round container, was four thousand yuan, and so were Bagua Dan and headache powder. The "good medicine for children," Partridge Cuisine, jumped to sixty-eight to seventy thousand yuan, and Xiaozhilong tablets and injections were around four thousand five to five thousand, and ointment also rose to two thousand five.</p>
<p>Since the government announced that it would announce emergency measures to stabilize the price of gold, and at the same time sent senior officials to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the accounts, the Western medicine market has also declined daily. In the general commodity market, Western medicine is one of the commodities that is more or less speculative, because its actual sales role is far less than the role of "chips." Therefore, the decline in market prices in these few days has been more significant and rapid than that of other commodities.</p>
<p>For example, all the above-mentioned drugs have generally fallen by 20 to 40 percent. The following table shows the final market price up to the government's announcement of the new exchange rate:</p>
<p>Aspirin eight thousand to ten thousand yuan, Gardan thirty thousand, Crisalbine twenty-two thousand, Black Lion 606 forty-three thousand, Dolantin injection one hundred and eighty to ninety thousand. American Sulfathiazole one hundred and eighty thousand, Sulfathiazole eighty thousand, 606 five thousand yuan, Monsanto saccharin three hundred and ninety thousand, double peach quinine three hundred and eighty to four hundred thousand, domestic new drug Universal Oil twenty-eight thousand per dozen, retail sales three thousand yuan, Bagua Dan fell from forty thousand to thirty thousand, headache powder also fell to twenty-two thousand, and Partridge Cuisine has fallen to less than sixty thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Even so, these prices are still much higher than before the gold rush. Just talking about spending three or four thousand yuan to buy a pack of Bagua Dan should be enough to make people feel burdened. As for such medicines as " , as a "small citizen" like you or me, we are fundamentally unable to try it. It is said that when it first arrived, each gram cost three to four hundred thousand, and the lowest market price a few days ago was about two hundred and fifty thousand. Although it is said to have "special effects," it may not necessarily be able to "bring back the dead," and even if it does have this "special effect," at least thirty or forty ampoules are required.</p>
<p>But news came that the exchange rate had been adjusted to twelve thousand to one, and the falling prices of Western medicines seem to be a flash in the pan and will rise again.</p>
<p>From now on, I hope to have three bowls of light rice, light hands and feet, and that even small illnesses like colds and coughs will never approach. I say, in this day and age, with Western medicine so expensive, is there anything more frightening than getting sick and taking medicine, my friend, don't you think so?!</p>
<h3>Shallow Words from the Marketplace</h3>
<p>— Menglong</p>
<p>Recently, the price of gold and the price of goods have seen both rises and falls, but after all, the rise is more, the fall is less, the rise is fast, and the fall is slow, the rise is like jumping, and the fall is like crawling. I hope it "jumps high and falls heavily"!</p>
<p>Three-color terror surrounds the citizens of the country: white refers to white rice, yellow refers to gold, and the one that stirs up the wind and waves is black, which refers to all "black-hearted" speculative activities. The only countermeasure of the authorities at present is to step up the investigation of these "three-color terrorists." Soon, these hoarders who fatten themselves will have no way to escape, and they will all be suppressed until the end. This is simply "the dead ghost demands payment, they deserve it"!</p>
<p>The higher the price of goods rises, the more prevalent speculation becomes. Conversely, the more prevalent speculation, the more the price of goods rises in direct proportion. This is the current major economic crisis, which is aptly described as: "a paper-glued bench, you can't sit on it!"</p>
<p>Big speculators don't see their own mischief, but insist on saying that others are meddling, which is what is called "a foot-long lampstand, illuminating far but not near"!</p>
<h3>A Small Businessman Talks About Chemical Industrial Raw Materials</h3>
<p>— Han Qin</p>
<p>I unintentionally met a distant cousin I hadn't seen in a few years, and he insisted on inviting me to sit in his shop for a while. Luckily, the road wasn't too far, so I went with him.</p>
<p>Near the Zhonghui Building, there are many chemical raw material shops, and he led me into one.</p>
<p>"When did you move here?" I asked, a little strangely.</p>
<p>"It's been several years. Ever since I and a few friends opened this raw material shop together, I've been living here."</p>
<p>I remembered that he used to be in the publishing business, how did he suddenly switch to chemical raw materials? I asked him, and he smiled.</p>
<p>"Didn't you used to study drawing? How are you now working at the exchange?"</p>
<p>I was left speechless by his question, but he chattered on, telling me that the business of this shop was very good when it first opened, but in the second half of the old year, the business was very slow, and he had been living off his savings for more than half a year. If there was no improvement this year, he wanted to change careers again. After I admired his business acumen, I asked him, as an outsider:</p>
<p>"How much business can you do in a day here?"</p>
<p>He laughed, "We don't rely much on retail business. These many old friends and staff would have starved to death long ago. The main thing is still large-scale imports and exports. A familiar customer calls, and we make a deal, because our capital is short, and we don't have much stock ourselves. With such high interest rates, we don't dare to import ourselves, we still act as agents to sell and buy for customers, and each transaction is quite substantial. At the end of last year, the market price of chemical raw materials suddenly moved, and at the beginning of this year, with the soaring foreign exchange, raw materials also rose. There are a few things, you won't believe me when I tell you, they have simply risen hundreds of times!"</p>
<p>I became worried and asked, "Is this related to people's livelihoods?"</p>
<p>"If you say it's related, what is not related to people's livelihoods? But the price increases are not something we, who act as agents to sell and buy for customers, can control."</p>
<p>"How much have they risen exactly? Tell me some things that I'm familiar with!"</p>
<p>"Like at the end of the old lunar year, caustic soda was only three million per barrel, yellow petrolatum was only five or six hundred yuan, baking soda was only thirty to forty thousand yuan, white oil was only ten thousand or so, and glycerin was only thirty to forty thousand yuan. Now caustic soda is six million, yellow petrolatum is one thousand yuan, baking soda is fifteen to sixteen thousand, white oil is nearly one million or so, and glycerin is over eighty thousand."</p>
<p>"Will this affect the cost of industrial products?"</p>
<p>He smiled sarcastically: "You don't need to ask me this."</p>
<p>"Then, what about the problem of competing with foreign goods?" I simply played the fool to the end.</p>
<p>"I'm not an economist."</p>
<p>That's right, he's just a small businessman, and he can only tell me that the market price is like this. As for issues affecting life, let us answer them ourselves.</p>
<h3>Cinema</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Refusing Rebuttal, Brazenly Raising Prices</p>
<p>The cinema refused the Social Bureau's rebuttal of the price increase and "brazenly" raised prices. The highest ticket price at one cinema is seven thousand yuan, but the black market at the entrance is quoting twelve thousand yuan.</p>
<p>If I had a lot of US dollars, it would be very convenient, because the official price is twelve thousand, but...</p>
<h3>We Are Not Cows Protesting to "Kedi" Company</h3>
<p>— Guohua</p>
<p>I am a loyal consumer of "Kedi" Milk Company, and I have been for ten years, without change. But in the near future, our relationship may be interrupted.</p>
<p>In the most recent year, since the victory, American goods have poured in like a tide, and the dumping of Klim milk powder has threatened the milk company. Many consumers have stopped ordering and switched to milk powder, but we old customers have remained steadfast. Half of this is due to inertia, and half is due to considerable affection, hoping that this will allow the milk company to maintain itself.</p>
<p>We treat the company this way, but the company does not treat its consumers this way. There is no need to talk about repeated price increases, but recently, the price has suddenly increased by 50%, and prepayment is required (ordering half a pound requires paying 90,000 yuan in advance, while before the increase it was 39,000 yuan per month), otherwise you must pay daily, which is too unfair to consumers.</p>
<p>The milk company has never suffered bad debts from its consumers, especially us old customers. The company should not distrust us in this way, requiring us to pay a large sum in advance, or treating us as ordinary retail customers.</p>
<p>The milk company's view of prices also seems to be too stimulating. Gold and the US dollar do not rise in price every day, why should milk be prepared to adjust every day? We do not believe that the company is calculating the cost of living index every day, nor do we believe that the company's expenses (such as wages and feed) are also calculated and priced daily.</p>
<p>What the milk company should be squeezing is cows, not consumers who are loyal customers. But now the company seems to be using milking methods on us consumers.</p>
<p>I am unwilling to be such a cow, so I say that in the near future, I am afraid that the ten years of friendship will be cut off in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>My current method is to never prepay, and wait for delivery to be stopped. And I call on fellow consumers not to be cows. Because what is squeezed out of us is not milk that nourishes the masses, but huge sums of cash and interest.</p>
