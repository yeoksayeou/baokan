<h3>恢復和談四項原則　主席大致已予同意　政府可能派員携赴延安</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京十五日電〕蔣主席十五日晚七時宴政府政協代表及吳鼎大維等，至八時散。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕蔣主席今晚七時半在官邸召　政府要員，研究恢復和談方案，到孫科，王寵惠，吳鼎昌，張羣，張治中，邵力子，王世杰，陳立天，張厲生，雷震等十一人。政府谷代表昨日在孫科寓邸會談之初步結果，今日上午已中雷震向主席報告，渠等今晚並就此方案繼續提供意見。主席對各代表所擬恢復和談方案之四項原則，大致同意，並有所指示。又悉，恢復和談方式，今尚未作具體決定，但僉信派員赴延安事，最有可能。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕邵力子十五日談，政府方案尚未作最後決定、其內容現不能宣布。延安方面若同意，即由赴延者携往。政府方面人士，日內可能再度集會，商討方案。政府意見或將經由司徒大使轉知共黨。記者詢以政府將派何人赴延？部答：那一個人去都一樣」。另一記者詢將來舉行圓桌會議抑直接談判？邵謂：此事須視延安方面意見如何。並謂，政府所重視者，爲恢復和談，並下拘泥何稱方式，希望共產黨勿認政府並無誠意。恢復和談或認政府因情勢不好非恢復和談不可，其實爲國爲民皆應恢復和談，不因那一方有此需要，始作和多努力。目前和談能否恢復，關鍵所在厥爲共產黨態度能否轉變。記者詢以對周恩來聲明之看法如何？邵氏稱，全文尚未見及。</p>
<p>政府方面和談意見　將由司使轉和共方</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕主席十五日晚宴政府政協代表後，曾接見司徒大使。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕司徒大使十五日晚會謁蔣主席，聞政府方面意見，可能經司使轉知共方。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日〕司徒大使十五日，上午十時偕傅涇波訪張羣，午間司使邀王炳南共進午　。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第三方面某有力人士告記者：和談固爲困難之工作，但目前政府之方案，中共可能加以考慮。又中共在魯南蘇北大軍之請動，及種種誇耀軍力之宣傳，目的在和而不在戰。蓋「能戰者始能和」，用意在製造談判之資本。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五電〕接近中共人士對報載政府所提和談方案之四項內容，作批評稱：若方案之內容，確如報上所載，則談判「經接觸，即將擱淺。政府所提「就地停戰」一點，等於要中共承認去年一月十三日以來，國軍所統領之中共地區，故若不實行一月之停戰協定，無法解決停戰問題與長期和平。關於整軍·交通·地方政權各點，整軍方案爲去歲一月所簽訂三個協定之一，恢復交通爲六月之四項協議中一項，地方政權爲政協中之一部份，故中共所盼望者，爲全部協定之實行，不能單獨提出有利的一部分作爲條件」。</p>
<h3>美將採間接方式　幹旋國共間衝突　司使正與各方保持接觸</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京十五日電〕此閒政治觀察家預測，美國將重行斡旋國共間之衝突，惟將採取間接方式。並謂：馬歇爾過去之努力，則並未採此方式，今司徒大使仍經常與南京中共代表團保持接觸，此點意義極爲重大。聞張羣曾以在滬與少數黨代表會談之經過情形，及政府解决現行僵局之决心，告知司使，並向司使保證美國之斡旋在未來談判中，仍有其重大任務。另一政府要員，係專事草擬準備送達中共之建議，頃告本社訪員稱：馬歇爾離華回國，並非美國停止斡旋之謂，事實適得其反，將再以較爲非正式而有效之方式，從事調解。故司使或將迅謀促成恢復和談及改級中國政府，一如馬歇爾在對華聲明中所要求者。</p>
<h3>周恩來發表演說</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕周恩來政協週年紀念日在延安演說，評論馬帥聲明。周演詞文長三千餘字，僅誣指政府破壞政協決議及停戰協定之詳細經過，對當前局勢並提有新意見。</p>
<h3>民社黨之批評</h3>
<p>目前最好不算舊賬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨發言人孫寶毅稱：民社黨一二日內將考慮發表宣言，站在人民之立塲，表明該黨對於重開和談之態度。論及周恩來之演辭，孫氏認爲周氏所指責之限制人民自由，缺乏省憲法，不採取內閣制等缺點，將來均可在憲法中加以修正，但不能否認國大，撕毀憲法。而政府召開國大，通過憲法，亦無所謂「不合法」，當前之問題，根本並非一法律問題，最好不算舊賬，誠心求取和解。站在黨的利益上，可有各種運用，但在人民之立塲，唯有和平方能生存。以駐軍地區而論，實施整軍方案後，全體軍隊屬於國家，無彼此之分。以地方政權而言，民主實現這後，統一亦必然形成。在民主國家，中央與地方之政權，常有分握於兩黨之手者。故如雙方均有誠意時，並無不能解決之困難。反之，如有人不顧人民之痛苦，故意造成和談之失敗者，全國人民當知責任之所歸。</p>
<h3>國民黨北平市　代表大會揭幕</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕中國國民黨北平市首次代表大會，今晨九時揭幕，中委李宗仁，駱美奠，陳繼承，何思源等親臨觀禮，並致訓詞後，即開預備會，推定大會主席團，午十一戰區長官部歡宴出席代表，下午三時續開第一次大會，通渦（一）電蔣主席致敬。（二）對死難同志哀悼之臨時動議兩件，並聽取黨務，政治報告，各代表熱烈詢問，迄下午五時半始散。七時半起舉行各組委員會審查提案，定十六晨賡續舉行大會。</p>
<h3>施諦文晤張發奎　談粵港中英關係</h3>
<p>〔由央社廣州十五日電〕英大使施諦文，十五日晨與張主任發奎，羅主席卓英，就粵港中·英關係有所會談，下午三時舉行記者招待會，答覆記者之詢問。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十四日電〕倫敦泰晤士報本日載其特派記者所撰長文，敦促英政府決定香港與中國長遠關係之政策，并建議發展香港社會經濟之五年或十年計劃。文中指出英國在香港公共工作上致力甚多，然對减輕大量中國居民之赤貧情况，致力甚少。</p>
<h3>軍調部下月解放　姜文人員業經決定召回</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十五日電〕權威方面本日對記者稱：北平軍調叫部將於下月第二星期中解散。駐京美方當局已決定在此後三週中召回軍調部美方人員，三十五年一月十日國共成立停戰協定後，馬帥所樹立之和平機構一俟國共代表召回後，即將「瓦解」矣。此舉殆爲美國調停中國內爭任務活動宜告終止之表示也，雖然，司徒大使在任期內，仍將繼續爲和平工作效力。</p>
<p>據悉：此間中共連絡處正焦急等待美國對軍調部之政策，中共發言人王炳南，曾數度向美大使館探詢軍調部將吾解散之消息。</p>
<h3>憲政實施促進委會　組織條例已通過　會長委員等由國府聘任</h3>
<p>中常國防　聯席會議</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕中常會第五十一次會，國防最高委會第二二六次會，十五日上午十時在中央黨部聯合舉行，出庭三十餘人，戴傳賢主席，通過憲政實施促進委會組織條例，全文計十九條，設下會長一人，副會長二至四人，設常務·考察·研究·宣傳四委會除國大代表全體爲當然委員外，正副會長，四委會負責人及其他委負，均由國府聘任。常務委員名額定九十五至一百廿五人，任期至下屆國大開幕時爲止，組織條例全文俟呈請蔣主席核定後，即由國府正式公布·又本日會議因研討本案甚久，其他例案多未及討論。</p>
<h3>臨棗台棗淺激戰方面酣　徐州成攻守重心　膠東共軍發動策應攻勢</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十五日電〕魯南戰事重心，現已移至棗莊煤礦之攻防戰，日來沿台棗支綫共軍之主刀，幾全部北移，且集中全力，對棗莊作殊死之猛攻，守軍上氣旺盛，沉着抗拒，共軍屢攻屢挫，損失慘重，刻共軍攻勢業呈聲嘶力竭之象。國軍某有力兵團，現已開抵棗莊附近，棗莊之國日內可解。魯南國軍目前已處於完全有利地位，戰避好轉乃指顧間事。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十五日電〕魯南共軍因南犯合兒莊不逞，現正集中全力，圍攻棗莊，共軍企圖攻陷棗莊後，重佔臨城，與津浦北段之共軍相呼應，聞昨曾有小股共軍竄至臨棗支綫，圖截斷棗莊國軍後路，旋被擊退。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州十五日電〕歷史上號稱兵家必爭之徐州，現又成爲國軍與共軍兩方守攻之塲。共軍目前分攻徐州東北之臨棗。台棗支綫，西北之金鄉，以及西南之永城，顯欲拔除徐州外圍之拱星，造成徐州之孤立。共軍挾其兵力數量較多之優勢，對國軍採用各個擊破之蠶食政策，國軍恪遵停止衝突命令，多所顧忌，招致軍事上若干損失，亦無庸諱言，惟國軍忍議亦有限度，棗莊。金鄉·永城所作屹然不動之固守，即係貪婪共軍以有力暗示，並促其覺悟引退，國是聽候政治商談解決。</p>
<p>〔又電〕（一）十萬共軍對棗莊之圍攻，迄十五日並未鬆弛，國軍堅强固守中。（二）竄至永城·亳縣間之共軍張太生部，十五日晨對永城縣城取包圍攻勢，國軍正奮力迎戰中。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南十五日電〕膠東共軍爲策應魯南作戰，向膠濟綫發動新攻勢，解四師·解九師各一部及新二·新三·新六團，萊蕪子弟兵團警一旅主力的二萬餘人，集結博山，明水以南地區，企岡北犯。膠南縱隊獨二旅，濱海獨一·獨二·獨三團及濱北軍分區隊約一萬五千人，竄集諸城，楊言進攻高密。其解五師竄據坡子（濰北二十五公里）西海，獨一二兩團竄據靑埠（昌邑東南十五公里），有攻犯昌濰企圖，另有解十一師侵據索鎭附近，右南犯長山鄒平及張店跡象。</p>
<h3>蘇北國軍　收復陰平</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十五日電〕據悉：（一）隴海東段劉伯誠部，目前集中主力達五個師以上，其中有日俘砲手及機槍手的一個團之衆，配合作戰。沭北廟頭陰平激戰已達兩畫夜，今晨六時國軍某團開始反擊，已將共軍完全全擊潰，於九時收復陰平。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十五日電〕灌　雖已收復，境內殘共日軍竄擾未已，殘殺據掠，無所不爲，中正塲以南楊家集以北週圍六十里之村莊，房屋全被焚燬，屍橫遍野，雞犬亦稀。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十五日電〕蘇北　，沐，灌，榆境內殘餘共事，確已北移突遷，肥皂河，　灣一綫，雙方激戰三日夜後，共軍因傷亡慘重，現已成對態峙。該綫共軍似期待　南援軍，加緊竄擾。</p>
<h3>淮陰漸告復興　沐陽缺乏現鈔</h3>
<p>銅元一枚當法幣念元</p>
<p>〔本報淮陰十四日電〕記者今自沭陽抵淮陰，該城自收復以來，在軍政當局協力下，已漸告復興，一般居民皆購年貨，準備歡渡此最興奮之農歷新年。</p>
<p>〔本報淮陰十四日電〕記者十一日隨軍抵沭陽城西南之毛大莊，午後隨李天霞師長入城，街道上除部隊來往逡巡外，沉寂異常，若干虎口餘生之居民，咸立於門首，注視國軍。法幣缺乏居民皆以銅元代替，每枚以法幣二十元計。蘇甯分署第一批賑粉已運到，並陸續裝運中。記者前謁見七十四師師長張靈甫，渠對記者樓述連水城之慘况，相與唏噓不置。十二日江蘇省政府民政廳長主公璵氏至沭陽視察，渠向記者稱，此行爲視察戶口整編之情形，並代縣政府設法籌集現金，俾責流通。渠復告記者，今後收復區行政機關之艱困，自不能免，但應以苦幹精神，打破當前之苦難。</p>
<h3>美經濟援華問題　參院外委會將重加檢討　馬歇爾返國期尙待決定</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十四日電〕一俟馬歇爾返國，美國會磋商後，美參院外交委員會將重新檢討對華之廣泛經濟援助問題。該委員會主席共和黨議員范登堡稱：馬氏於前往莫斯科參加三月十四日外長會議之前，將被邀檢討其使華經過。據今日最近消息，馬氏何時可我華府，尙未確定　，須俟杜魯門總統與馬氏再度通話後，方可決定。又訊：馬氏在　香山之休息時間，已較其預定者爲久，華府中界咸亟盼馬氏早日返美。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平十五日電〕美方檢察官與辯護律師今日同意「美軍強姦女學生」案提早至十七日上午九時審判。美方此舉在謀此案從　　得法律解決，以免滋生國際糾紛。事前辯護律師曾提議二十日（星期一）審判，可連續審判六日，不致中輟，但美軍當局認爲此案應儘量提早結束，並與全部證人（包括華人）會晤後，遂於本日下午決定，於十七晨九時開始審判此案。</p>

<p>外傳被槍擊落實不確一</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十五日電〕上海一某報載稱，美軍用機一架在開平一附近被擊墮寺，駕駛員業已受傷等情，殊與事實不符。緣陸戰隊軍用機一架，因引擎發生障碍，在被迫降落時墮於唐山附近，駕駛員並未受傷。</p>

<h3>投城共軍長報告　冀東「解放區」內幕　物資乏壯丁逃亡民財枯竭　士兵五分之三無衣被</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津十五日電〕共軍十四旅副參謀長趙卓然，課長溫振華，三十三團第三營長傅珊亭，新近次第向冀東國軍投誠，日前幷招待記者，報告冀東「解放區」內慕，茲綜誌如下：</p>
<p>（甲）政府方面：共軍目前主要政治工作，（一）鼓動靑年參戰，（二）展開淸算運動，（三）封鎖物資，致冀東「解放區」各縣物資匱乏，壯丁逃亡與被殺戮者比比皆是。共軍封鎖物資之方式，爲「區不離區，縣不離縣」，百物均須就地交易，促使物資紛紛流入共軍手中。淸算運動貧民分得物資或土地，而其名爲「勝利果實」，尤以一般終年游手好閒之村民，遽得「果實」，情不自禁，作惡無忌，貧農則認爲坐食「果實」，何須耕種，致各縣田地荒蕪，雜草　生，共軍乃得遂其破壞經濟之企圖。</p>
<p>（乙）經濟方面：冀東「解放區」邊幣發行，以遵化爲中心，規定法幣一元八角換邊幣一元，村民深知邊幣命運不長，忍痛以物換物，三升玉米換布二尺，白　一斤換王米半斤。共軍高級官佐利用權勢，於旅以上部隊，設有生產合作社，榨取民財，如布疋入「區」，每疋抽稅三萬，不論其價值如何。軍以上則設貿易局，公開售毒。</p>
<p>（丙）軍事方面：冀東共軍主力共有三旅之衆，番號爲第十，第十一，第十二，轄八個團一個警備團，此外有獨立團一團，砲兵團一團，人數一萬，民兵十萬，其中多係新兵，新萬官兵簡猜忌日深，其下級士兵，三年未發襯衣，每一營中，五分之三無衣被，每養以玉米爲主，菜名，「太平洋」，意即白水漂菜葉。最近厭戰情緒日高，最近坨子頭一戰，共軍一連人，棄槍而逃者即有三十六人之多，第三十一團第三營只剩排長一人。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>對於四國外次會議的期望</h3>
<p>英美法蘇四國外决會議，已於十四日在倫敦開慕，英國外相貝文親臨主持，並發表歡迎詞，希望不復造成足使德國東山再起之局勢。從十五日起，已開始討論對德奧兩國之和的草案，並將爲莫斯科四國外長會議商定議事日程。所以道一决的四國外决會議，實可目爲對德奧和談的序慕，據過去的經騐，四國外長每遇意見不一致的時候，輒將問題提交外决會議處理，即能獲得四國一致的協議。而德奧問題，尤其是對德和的問題，巴黎四國外長會議旣未能予以解決，紐約四國外長會議又未能獲致協議，現提交倫敦四國外次會議處理，我們站在一九四七年的歲苜，對於今年這一次的國際會議，不能不表示殷切的期望。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰的爆發，日本軍國主義者與納粹德國，同爲罪魁禍首；照理一經戰爭勝利結束之後，聯合國就應該首先處置德日兩國的；但是戰事迄今已歷十八個月，對日德兩國的和談，尚未開始，不能不說是近代外交史上罕有的現象。推原其故，因爲英美法蘇等主要戰勝國的意見，未能趨於一致；一九四五年七月波茨坦會議時，本可使應先解決的德國問題，獲得解決的，惟因英國首相邱吉爾的下野，美國總統羅斯福的突然逝世，使世界三巨頭更換了兩個巨頭，艾德禮與社魯門，均以國際新人物的姿態出現，與斯丹林不免有互相隔膜之處，從此德國問題也就擱淺下來了。</p>
<p>一直到日本屈膝投降第二次世界大戰完全告終之後，中英美法蘇五國外長在倫敦開會，大家都覺得有進行對德和談的必要，但不幸在倫敦五國外長會議中，英美與蘇聯對於德國問題的見解，截然不同，不啻是南轅北轍，無法成立協議，因此五國外長會議也就不歡而散。其後三國外長在莫斯科會議，雖在原則上成立妥協，但是巴黎四國外長會議，並未能擴大莫斯科三國外長會議所獲得妥協約基礎，僅能避重就輕，通過了對義，羅，匃，保，芬五國的和的草案；並決定召開巴黎廿一國和會。因此使對義羅匃保芬五國的和的，先對德和的而產生，吾人對此雖不免有舍本逐末之感，但亦不失爲外交上的一種權宜之計。</p>
<p>上决紐約四國外長會議的主要任務，乃在討論德國問題，惟因法國國內的政局發生了極大的變動，使外長比社爾不能離開國門一步，同時法國外交常局，又堅持，非由法國外長比杜爾親自參加，外長會議不得先行討論德國問題。所以紐約四國外長會議僅僅決定莫斯科四國外長會議討論對德奧和約的議程六項而已。其要點如次：（一）討論盟國管制德國委員會所提出之報告；（二）決定德國臨時政治組織之形式及其範圍；（三）起草對德和的；（四）討論美國所起草的解除德國武裝四十年條約之草案；（五）審議關於德國煤斤生產與分配所提出之報告書；（六）起草對奧和的。我們對於外長會議處理德國問題一年餘以來所獲得的結果，雖不能表示十分滿意，但是看到德國問題一步步走向解決的途徑，內心終存着幾分希望。</p>
<p>本報對於去年紐約外長會議的成就，曾一再提出其影響所及；一方面使一九四六年的國際政治獲得一個平靜的歸趨；另一方面又巷一九四七年的國際政治展開一個美妙的遠景；所以對於本年第一次的國際會議，特別關切，竭誠祝望其成功。但是我們檢討過去，對德問題研以不能解決，乃因各國的利害衝突與意見紛歧，各國的外長不是堅持成見，就是唯自已的利益是圖，不肯稍讓一步，當難獲得妥協。我們再默察外次會議中各國代表的態度，即不難獲悉各國代表的見解，依然如故，仍以各該國的利益爲出發點。所以我們不得不在這裏憂慮，四國代表如果不改變態度，仍斤斤於本身的利益，而不能顧全大局，則這次四國外决會議仍難有獲得圓滿結果的希望。我們雖不是不切現實的理想主義者，但是終覺得這次四國外次會議以及三月間召開的莫斯科四國外長會議，如欲元成其旣定的任務，則四國的外交當局對於德奧兩國的態度，均應以合理與正義爲基礎，以謀得德奧問題的澈底解決。德奧兩國間題，論其性質截然不同，不能一概而論，自應分別處理。例如對於德國，自應予以嚴懲，即責其賠償戰時損失，亦屬合理，但是國際外交家應該高囑遠瞻，特別重視德國人民的再教育，以肅淸德國人民所受納粹的麻醉及餘毒，務使其在國際間也成爲一個愛好和平的國家，下再威脅歐洲的和平與安全。同時對於德國的戰爭工業，決不能聽其存在，而應剝奪乾净，不許某再留禍根，至一二十年之後，德國侵略勢力又能東山再起。所謂防微杜漸，處處要特別小心謹愼，隨時要提高警覺，千萬不能再造成足使德國東山再起的局勢。</p>
<p>至於奧地利，她是希特勒侵略主義者的犧牲者，四國對於奧國都應該負起扶助奧國獨立的義務，不僅在口頭上應允許其獨立，而且在實際上也應該予以經濟的援助，使其成爲中歐的一個安定勢力，一方面旣爲東歐與西歐的橋樑，另一方面又爲多瑙河各國在經濟上實行合作的中堅。中歐是歐陸的心臟，奧地利的自主與獨立，實爲歐陸安危所繫。歷史的教訓，最值得國際政治外交家的深思。</p>
<p>我們展望四國外决會議處理德奧問題的前途，雖然充滿了光明與希望，但是在四國外次次議的四週，却也看到滿佈着暗礁與寒流。</p>
<p>第一是蘇聯與英美之間的關係。在紐約外長會議與聯合國大會第二次大會相繼閉會之後，蘇聯與英美的關係，已見好轉，尤其是蘇聯對於國際的態度，已有顯著的改變，可謂由强硬變爲和緩了。此在英美方面，對於蘇聯也有尊重其安全感之誠。意，尤其是英國，深恐蘇聯輕信英美軍事同盟約傳說，特田陸軍參謀長梅萊一點蘇聯訪問，對於英蘇關係的好轉，將有莫大的裨益。但是從美國內政外交未來的趨勢看來，美國的外交政策在共和黨的控制之下，美蘇關係的好轉，又不能樂觀過早了。。</p>
<p>第二是法蘇兩國之間的關係。戰後法國政治已有顯著的進步，確已走上和平民主的大道，當爲蘇聯所樂於接近。所以戰後法蘇兩國的關係，一直非常友好密切，抑且法國外交家在歷屆國際會議中，雖站在第三者調處的立塲，但終不免有袒　蘇聯的地方。戰後法國外交的成功，也是靠了這一點微妙的關係。以對德問題而論，英美的意見大體相同；德境英美兩國佔領區在經濟上合併，早已經實行了，雖千方百計，誘致法國參加，但是到現在，還沒有成功。由此可知法國的見解與英美的政策，大有　別，而比較與蘇聯的見解相似，這也是衆所週知的事實。英國爲歐洲的前途計，同時也爲本身的利益計，與法國謀得意見上的一致，實爲非常必要的。因此在本年初乃有法國運輸部長莫許作倫敦之行，這幾天來，法國內閣總理勃魯姆亦赴英倫聘問，與艾德禮首相互相交換對德問題的意見，在旁觀者的蘇聯看來，不能不發生「酸性」作用，蘇聯駐法大使鮑格莫洛夫的突然返國述職，實在值得我們的重視，所以法國在蘇聯與英美之間的三角翻係，也是以引起外次會議的寒流。</p>
<p>第三是荷蘭，比利時，丹麥，捷克，盧森堡等十八國的紛紛提出備忘錄，站在正義的立塲，這些小國的意見是應該予以尊重的，因爲英美蘇三國嚴格地說來，不能認爲眞正的歐洲國家，而這些小國，才是眞正的歐洲國家；但是如何調和各國互相矛盾的意見？足使外次會議的工作，更加困難了。</p>
<p>要之，倫敦四國外次會議的舉行，實爲莫斯科四國外長會　的前奏，其成敗對於本年國際政治的發展，將有莫大的影響，就是對於遠東，也有密切關係，足以決定對日和約起草的遲早。所以我們對於這次四國外次會議以及三月間在莫斯科的外長會議，都竭誠祝望其圓滿結束。</p>

<p>讀報知自三十六年元旦起，全國中等以上學校學生公費一律停止，消息傳來，我們學子不勝驚異，目睹內戰相煎，百政供敝之今日，已感苦悶萬端，徬徨無路，而政府猶復忽視敎育，苛及畏宮，我們對於民族文化，不能不傷心！我們對於黯淡之現實，不能不墮淚！</p>
<p>我們國家，抗戰八年，物力財力，損毀過鉅，淪陷區域，則因學校播遷，師徒轉徙，流離顚沛之結果，衣食縱艱，豈復有金錢讀書，而未　敵人蹂　之區，亦因爲國捐輸，而呈匱乏之象，是以我們同學，為人耕作者有之，厠身勞役者有之，（在國立四川大學同學，有爲校擦黑板者，有當店員者，有作郵佐者，其他如西南聯大同學，為人挖地鋤草比比皆是），藜　自甘，簞瓢屢空，興亡責重，夫復何言，所望者；勝利後，天日重光，弦誦毋輟，而乃今以取消公費聞，令寒畯之士，無深造之機會，則千里卓特之士，又何以培植乎？</p>
<p>夷考公費制度，其來已久，漢畫載文翁起學官於成都市中，招下縣子弟之開敏有才者為『學官弟子』，即其例也，後世科舉，因襲前制設置『陳生』，亦由官府給以陳祿，至明洪武二年，月陳人六斗，且由有司給以魚肉，名額加多，號『增廣生』，因是蓬墓之士，亦得上翔，即如近世之蘇俄，於民國二十六年，大學生每人月給二十餘盧布，薪給之多，可以敵一小公務員而有餘，遠如美國，國家之教育經費，古全國總預算百分之三十以上，其重視敎育可知，是以二大國皆科學昌明，文物稱盛，東西相望，兩相頡頏，回顧我國今日之敎育經費。乃不足總預算百分之六，而政府猶欲以區區之數减少之以補充軍費（我國今日軍費占全國預算百分之七十五）則誠可謂利盡雄刀之末，善『節流』之能凍矣，</p>
<p>中外歷史上之大英雄大豪傑，科學界之權威，哲學界之　斗，多出自變　繩樞，西洋人之孤兒院，貧兕所，亦能培養傑出之人才，由此可微，髦俊之徒，固不必皆爲宮厚之子，而我賢明之政府，偏反歷史之原則，開此不合理之先例，將貧士剝削之，壓抑之，則我們相信，不造成『上品無寒門，下品無士族』不止。　利益交征，衣裳顚倒，銀行之工友，壟望之市儈，乃大腹便便，席豐履厚，而為人師表之敎授，攪腦汁運思慮之學生，則鳩形鵠面，懸　百結，寗非咄咄怪事？吳又陵先生曰：『昔魏徵之序儒林，常謂古之學者，祿在其中，今之學者，困於貧賤，明達之人，安能滯於所習，以求貧賤哉？此所以儒罕通人，學多鄙俗」是知易風移俗，其必由學，不然，詎能振此頹運？</p>
<p>為了建國計，為了民族文化計，為了高等敎育發展之前途計，我們不能不抗議，不能不嚴重的抗議，我們並以最熱愛沉痛之心情，向社會人士作合理的呼籲，希望給予我們有力之聲援，務使政府對今日之敎育，速給以最大之重視，使公費制度繼續維特，培養優美之研究環境，以達成敎育之建國任務，則不特靑年學子之幸，社會國家亦拜惠多矣。</p>

<p>一個騎巡隊員申述</p>
<p>昨天看到貴報刋載，市參議會發表的消息，內有參議員丁着明，陸薩初兩先生，對警察局的質詢，是關於騎巡隊的事、情。因為我是騎巡隊的一份子，有出入的地方，不得不來聲明一下。參議員丁善明等先生說：「近日北新涇每夜有盜案，騎巡隊能否前往該區巡邏彈壓等語」，查騎巡隊駐滬西分隊，除專任該區日夜巡邏外，另由部隊加派一分队，協助巡　，新涇分局記錄簿內，有案可查，各報曾刋載「匪盜待機而動，騎警發覺繫散，昨晚林肯路上警匪格鬥，紛紛逃逸，深夜尙在搜尋」等消息可以印證，元旦前後我們奉到命令，不放假，不林息，加紫巡邏，每日午後五時由隊部出發，直至次晨五時，漫長的深夜，整個的在郊外風雨泥泊中跋涉着，有誰知道，人家甜夢的時候，正是我們一羣在凍餒中工作的當兒呢！希望貴報將我們實際情况，批露一下，給諸公先生們知道我們的任務。「自鳴」　在蘇州河畔四川路橋東以前是中國花園，現在改舖煤屑成為汽車停車塲，是本市的公有地。自開闢成為停車塲以後，最初因為路口有水泥階沿，未曾剷平，汽車進出不便，很少車輛前往停留。後來剷平幾處，逐漸有汽車在停放了。然而一大部份空塲，被幾千只空油桶所堆置，另一部份被修船人佔用，有用作木工作塲，亦有堆置船上拆下的廢鋼板，形形色色，不能盡述。筆者為市民一分子，目此大好公地，未能妥善利用，故提出下列問題，擬請有關當局予以解答。（一）查該地旣已闢為停車塲，應予以整頓，設置公用電話，及管理人地上劃定車輛位置，出入途徑，不應常此無人管束，類如空塲。同時有公用電話，雖路遠汽東亦可來停放，如稍收費用，管理之費亦有着落。（二）該塲所堆公物，亦不相宜。因旣闢作停車塲，即應作停車塲運用。否則界限不分，貨物進出，難免不與汽車碰撞，汽車主決不願其車輛為停放而受損失。（三）該塲所堆貨如屬商貨，係由某一機關或某一個人所許其堆置，是否收受費用，其費用是否歸公？（四）如所堆貨物公家未收費用，是否有第三者利用機會，收受費用？有關機關不能視若無覩，以公地任入免費運用，總上各點務望有關機關速即予以解答，並速即予該地以合理運用。在此市庫支絀時期，能利用該地增加市收益，則亦市民减輕負担之一助也。（申與光）</p>

<h3>史比資貝根羣島聯防　蘇挪成立基本協定　莫斯途公面雙方談判經過　引起英國反響美暫守緘默</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十五日電〕蘇聯電台負責宣布：挪威與蘇聯政府就修改一九二八年巴黎條約所規定之史比資貝根羣島問題進行談判，業已成立基本協定。談判曾於一九四四－四五年內一度進行，直至上月間重開。當時蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在紐約出席聯合國大會，與挪威外長會晤，乃舊事重提，雙方均認爲有聯防該島之必要。</p>
<p>蘇聯提出之修約理由有三：（一）蘇聯政府並未參加該的之擬訂，而參加草擬該約之若干國家，後來又對盟國作戰。（二）條約中規定以米特維奇島界予挪威，該島以前實在屬於蘇聯。（三）史比資貝根目前之地位，在經濟與國防上均與蘇聯不利。蘇聯代表在談判時，復申明戰前蘇聯海軍自史島煤礦得蘇聯人掘出煤斤之接濟，在每年總產量六十五萬噸中，得其四十萬噸。該電台後稱，史島在第二次世界大戰中所處地位異常重要。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕英外部發言人今日責問蘇聯對史比資貝根羣島中梅特維齊島之新要求之稱，一九二〇年國際條約解除該島武裝，蘇聯仍受此條約之約束，「該區係挪威領土，吾人不知蘇聯有何權力，可要求該區任何島嶼」。按蘇聯塔斯通訊社引述「蘇聯權威人士」之言·謂梅特維齊「實係蘇方島嶼」，又宜佈蘇聯與挪威已商妥，必需在該區「共同防衛」，一九二〇年條約下復有效，因其簽字國中有對聯合國交戰之國家在內。按此語係指義兩國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十五日電〕外傳挪威與蘇聯已就「在必要時聯防史比資貝根羣成立基本協定」之說，此間國務院官負在未獲莫斯科方面正式報告之前，拒不加以評論。</p>

<h3>霧雪·破颶風　人力萬能！</h3>
<p>最近世界各地時有飛機失事，殞命者達三百人以上，但是對於科學家未嘗不是一種新刺激，他們決心要用人力來戰勝大自然。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕近來世界各地時有飛機失事，死傷頗衆，其　　最大原因，厥爲機塲迷霧，視綫不淸，未能安然降落。美國氣候學家現正動員研究，爲一勞永逸之計，欲以人力操縱氣候，</p>
<p>大功靠成　或需數載</p>
<p>並謀驅散航空港周圍之濃霧，以保安全。美國氣候局與陸海軍及優秀之私人科學家，現正聯合進行普遍研究計劃，或須歷時數載，方可得有成績，但皆期望能確知是否可以龐大之人力，如原子能或大火，以打破海上颶風，世界上多數風暴雪暴，及其所致破壞，皆綠此等颶風所致。問題則在如何認認醖釀中之風暴，而用充分力量將其打破，或使之改道。研究重心爲一種新式計算要，其計算之速將十百萬倍於目前所有者。按照所擬計劃，其進和步驟如下：</p>
<p>（一）　在氣象學方面獲知更多之事實，允着重於空氣行動之定律，此非在全世界普遍觀察不可。</p>
<p>（二）　作成數學公式，內中包含由氣象觀察所得之許多事實，以供　計算　，其所得天氣預測，亦以公式出之。</p>
<p>（三）　科學家將密切觀察世界風暴之產生，　以決定在　　風暴之任可地點，是否　用一種　大力量將其打破，　次使之改道。若　　　此可能，科學家將決定人類如何對之作張有力，之反攻，若係應用原子能，並將設法安全利用</p>
<p>改變氣候　尙在初階</p>
<p>人類會小規模的證明可以改變當地之氣候，奇　電氣公司實騐研究室主任許弗會駕飛驪駛過雲層，拋出乾冰層，地面　　者即見正當·高爾夫擬作進一步研究，以馴散航空港周國之迷霧。紐遮賽普林期登高等研究院牛門博士，爲世界最有名，學家之一，現有若干科學家與之共同研究，以計算　應用於氣象學使之開　一新局面。尚有氣候局專門科學組主任偉克斯勒博士亦在從事研究。此外陸海軍航空學家與氣象學家，如紐約大學之潘諾夫斯基教授，阿爾奇爾土壤學學院之毘萊博土，及航空氣候這湯姆生中尉，皆在共同協助，以解決一切問題。氣候局每週輒　到來函十餘通，對於人造氣候提供意貝。實則「造雨」爲古代一種職業。美國晨業都曾於一八九一年試騐一種學說，如用足量之化學炸彈在雲層內或雲層附近爆發，可使水氣沉澱，此事曾在華盛頓及丹克薩兩地試騐果能致雨。據　克期進博士稱，世界止多數颶風之發生地點業已確定，即大西洋南部與客立此因海，美國東海岸之風暴皆由此而來。</p>
<p>此外則爲南洋羣島，印度洋及太平洋之西部與南部。後者所發生之風暴掠過日本與阿流申羣島，其旁支觸及加拿大，再向東南展至美國，發生狂風或大雪。</p>
<p>燃燒汽油驅散颶風</p>
<p>某科學家曾提出建議，颶風初起時，若用汽油或煤油在其發源處之洋面上燃燒，火勢冲天，可使之分裂成許多小　兩而不致爲　。因熱力使空氣上升，可以開散停留在洋面上之隊空氣。科學家觀爲颶風之發生，即由此音留之　空氣而來。章克斯勒博士現尚未知如何應用原子能以　破正在進行中之颶風取颶風。據稱，駝　係一　空氣，發出大量熱力，迨水蒸氣　而爲雲，即將降雨。熱使一部份空氣上升，其四周之空氣即乘虛而入，成一大　渦，如水自浴盆放出，惟空氣像廻旋上升。此廻旋之　個氣　將在洋面上移動。日本某科學家會觀察琉球羣島之颱風，的計每秒鐘產生之能，等於四十萬噸ＴＮＴ炸藥。科學家曾估計原子炸彈之爆炸力等於二萬噸ＴＮＴ，是則須有二十枚原子彈在一秒鐘內爆炸，始能與琉球羣島　風之力相等。</p>

<p>費氏自於去年八月抵華後，對促進中阿邦交，致力極多，渠將於舊曆新年期間，以渠佩帶歷十五年之寶劍一柄，贈獻與蔣主席，該劍爲渠肄業阿根廷軍校時，前任阿總統伍立本所授之獎品。　經費氏之努力協助，中阿商會及中阿文化社交協會，業已成立，後者之主要目的，係自阿國運輸布疋糧食來華，以濟匱乏。費氏以誠摯之態度聲稱，「經由上述兩項組織，中國人民將了解阿國，更爲深切，同時經由阿國之同樣組織，　國人民亦將對中國獲致更深刻的了解，中阿兩國具有甚多之共同點，阿國人民對中國爲爭取自由獨立與民主之英勇抗戰，極爲欽佩」。</p>

<p>記者詢以對中國政治局勢之意見，費氏認爲目前之困難局勢，爲中國八年長期抗戰後所不可避免。渠深信基於中國之豐當資源及民主精神，和平統一，終必實現，蓋以最近舉行之國民大會及制憲工作而觀，不僅充分證明中國之民主精神，且亦引導中國向民主之目原前進也。</p>

<h3>瘋牛人鬧事亂竄傷人　北浙江路　一塲驚擾　警察趕來立時正不法　槍斃牛排味道若何</h3>

<h3>翟桂如女士學成歸來　談美國婦女生活概況　女子多于男子普遍鬧着男子荒　社交絕對公開婚變因是特別多</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕翟桂如女士，民盟領袖周鯨文的夫人，新近自美國學成回來，昨午和記者暢談留美經過和美國婦女的生活概況。</p>
<p>翟女士是二年前赴美的，出國的目的純粹是爲了旅行。曾經在紐約的蒙哈頓大學及賓雪凡尼亞的瑪琍大學讀過家政學，這兩個學校，都是女子大學，所以翟女士對於美國婦女問題，尤其是女學生的生活情形，是比較淸楚，也曾下過一番研究工夫，因而我們談話中心，也就轉向這一面。</p>
<p>女子大學貴族化　據翟女士漁：目前的美國，普遍地鬧着「男子荒」。也許是戰爭的後果吧，據美國的人口統計結果，女子是多於男子的。這情形尤其是在紐約城特別器重，因爲鄉村裏的女子，多願意到城裘來學時髦，所以紐約男女的比例，是十與一之比。於是未婚的男子，在紐約小姐的眼目中，是視爲最珍貴的了。每一個女學生，只要在例假日能够得到男友的邀請，她便會雀躍三百！即使是吃一杯最平凡的咖啡，她會引爲無上的光榮，而必須向女友作一番喜悅的誇耀！</p>
<p>美國的女子大學大多是比較貴族化的，校中除了授與自立之基本技能外，還着重於社交上之禮節，目的在訓練成善於交際之賢妻良母。每當晚餐時，大家必須換上長長的夜禮服，一舉一動都要合乎禮貌。每屆節日來臨，校方特舉辦舞會，讓每個學生謂她們的男朋友來跳舞。此外，游水，打球，騎馬……求學生活輕鬆而渝快。</p>
<p>滿足愛美的慾望</p>
<p>在這種舒適的生活中，美國婦女，甚至可以說包括男子在內，很少會注意政治的。女人們把最多的時間和金錢，耗費在化妝和服飾上。紐約時裝公司是足够驚人的，差不多三天二天翻一次新花樣，不是百萬大富翁就休想追得上。</p>
<p>職業婦女佔美國婦女總數的大半，而打字員又佔職業婦女的大半。她們任職的目的，大多是爲了賺點錢來可以把自己打扮得更漂亮一點。因爲化妝品是如此節貴，靠着丈夫有限的收入實難以滿足自己愛美的慾望，於是不得不自己找一點事情，以謀貼補了。</p>
<p>迷路兒童特別多</p>
<p>主婦們有了職業，孩子們如何安放呢，紐約沒有大規模的托兒所，而美國的情形和國國不同，可以把孩子交給老媽子。在美國，一個老媽子的月薪是美金一百元，恰好等於一個辦事員的薪水的全部，所以極少人願得赴老媽子。美國人住洋房，坐汽事，然而雇不起老媽子的例十多得很。於是做母親的，只得把孩子任意留在家裏，所以美國警察局中，收留的迷途兒童特別多。也有因此肇成滔天大禍的。就在最近，紐約城中的一家人家，當父母都出外工作時，七歲的哥哥，把三歲的弟弟裝閉在大木箱中開玩笑，結果便把他活活地窒息死了。</p>
<p>緣何自已打自己</p>
<p>美國的社交是絕對公開的，任何女子可以和一個從不相識的男子出去跳舞，吃飯，看電影，生活過於羅曼蒂克的結果，使婚變特多。美國有一個雷諾城，是以離婚聞名的？美國人稱之爲離婚城，那兒的法律，離婚特別自由。所以雷散丈夫或妻子的任何一方有意離異時，只要到　諾域歲行一次，在幾小時內，便可把一切手續辦妥了。</p>
<p>號說中美邦交頻繁，但是一般美國人對中國的瞭解還是有限度的。到少在他們眼中的中國已倒退了數十　。特別是對我國政治情形的觀察更形　淺，　們奇怪爲什麼中國人老變內戰？中國　年來未曾間斷的內戰，使他們覺得中國人有好　的　性，每個中國人都是　尚戰爭的　　當他們遇見了中國人，十　倒　九個要聞：「爲什麼你們老愛自己人打自己人　！」</p>
<p>說　這兒，　女士長　一聲說，　每當聽到了這一類的問題，頭總有說不出的難過。其實，那一個中國人民願意再有戰爭呢？</p>
<h3>農林部積極策劃　發菜沿海漁業　電滬市府請予協助</h3>
<p>農林部爲謀發展沿海漁業，改善漁民生計，現決着手漁民團體組識，發動漁民識字運動，爲謀便于推行起見，頃特函請全國各地方機關，協助推行，本市市政府于昨日接獲該部代電云「查吾國海岸綿長漁塲面積廣泛，漁港散列于沿海及島嶼間，漁輪出沒于公海及領海之中，人民直接間接依靠漁業爲生者數達七百餘萬之衆，以是關于「漁民運動」，實爲主要，戰前沿海漁民智識低淺，向無健全組織，致遠處漁塲盡爲外人採捕，成爲侵漁事實，因此漁村瀕于破產，漁民多淪盜匪。抗戰事起，沿其衝，八年來，又復殘，漁民流離失所，滋值勝利復員，失地重光，漁民還鄉復業，對于沿海漁業及改善漁民生計，以來設施便利起見，極應先從漁民組織及發動漁民識字運動着手，以期漁村整理，灌輪漁民智識，技能改進漁民生活，得以并籌兼顧，而收羣力護漁之功，此不僅收效普遍而深切，且亦爲樹立將來沿海漁業建設之基礎，庶幾漁政，可以順利推行，事關我國漁民生計，極宜協助本部各該　區海洋漁業督導處積極辦理，以謀補救」。市府接文後，已飭令社會局遵照聯理云。</p>
<h3>滬商品檢驗局　訓練檢驗人才</h3>

<h3>前工部局華員請願　吳市長懇切勸諭　債務業已轉移　迎向市府商洽　賑目紛繁清算稽延　决催財局從速辦理</h3>

<p>英鎮事館以租界所有產業債權均已移交市府，債務亦迎由市府淸償，故昨晨即通知我方由外交部駐滬辦事處特派員孫玉書，市政府外事室主任董壽鵬，至領事署接見請願代表。孫氏等向衆解釋稱，按照接收租界條例，今日論位之值權，即係市府之債務，故請大家要認清請願對象。至於市府對於此項儲蓄金之發還問題，已與有關機關組織清理委員會亟謀解決，且吳市長對於諸位境况亦極爲關切，關於善後辦法，請派代表至市政府商談。但在塲仍堅持向英領事署交涉，且羣情激昂，　持至下午二時餘仍無結果，吳市長乃親自理至英領事館，曉諭羣衆，並囑推代表循正當途徑謀合理解決。四時後請願人員始離英領署轉至市政府，推派代表九人，並會同前工部局警務處華人督察長姚家瑞晉謁市長。</p>
<p>市長首謂「此事大家請願我固要辦理，下請願我也要辦理的。」並懇切說明市府已於去年八月間成立淸理委員會負實類似事件，惟因賬目極爲紛煩，一時不易算淸，且依法必須向中樞請示，俟獲批准後方可實施。本人現決催財政局谷局長速辦，並儘量爲大家着想，將數　提高，諸位代表與姚家瑞君以後均社隨時見面洽辦·最後又諄囑「寬有頭，債有主」，市府已承認大家爲債主，萬勿再聚集向英領署請願，以免引起不必要之麻煩，且事關關家榮譽，尤希大家特別注意。各代表對於市長所言，均感滿意，請願羣衆旋即在「拜託我們的市長做大家總代表」聲中散去，一塲風波暫告平息。</p>

<p>王曉　稱：我國之工廠不論範圍大小，目前均已遭受莫大危機。全國商業聯合會，市參議會及市商會等皆紛紛向政府請求救濟。救濟之方法，可分兩步：一爲除病，即了解其困難，然後對症下藥；理一步則爲使其健康。政府現舉辦之生產貸款法中，若僅允許以原料及製成品抵押，廠房及機器均不能作押，則本市工商業仍無法謀得發展。金融界及工商界有相互連繫，無工商界，即無金副界，望金融界能注意及此，而謀枝葉並茂。王氏復以國家與人民爲喻，謂國家猶如金融界，人民猶如工商界，若國家不顧人民之生活，則當人民活不下去時，亦必將發生大變亂，大革命也。</p>
<p>繼由議長潘公展致詞稱：生產貸款與工業貸款稍有不同，工業貸款祗准原料及成品作爲抵押，其後果可能使原料及成品呆滯囤積。所以這是矛盾的，一方面要使生產增加一方面又要讓原料囤積。現政府舉辦之生產貸款已較改進，其中一半可以廠房機器作抵押，惟祇限於大型廠商，一般中小廠商仍無法貸得。而事實上中小廠商對於社會經濟秩序之影響頗大，對於物價及市民日常生活，均有影響。故中國生產促進會上海分會此次舉辦中小型廠商生產貸款，極有意義，望各界羣起推動，期於金融界工商界密切合作之下，獲得　滿之結果。</p>
<p>後由該會委員盛公恕，沈鶴峰等。相繼報吿工作情形，略謂舊曆年內，亟待救濟之小型廠商，計五十餘家現該會已向本市各商業銀行發出信件二百餘封，然尙無具體結果。廠商表示一切貸款手續，均願遵辦，有押品，有担保，只求渡此舊曆年關，於明春即可歸還。僅望利息能較現行黑市便宜三分之一，盼金融界加以協助。</p>
<h3>國貨展覽商塲昨閉幕　原址將建永久性場屋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國生產協會上海分會所主辦之國貸展覽商塲，已於昨日宣告期滿閉幕。昨午四時假靜安寺路該塲大禮堂中舉行閉幕典禮，出席商界名流及各廠商代表等五百餘人。典禮於樂聲中準時開始，吳市長因要公未到，由參事葛克信代表。閉幕禮由商塲委員胡伯翔主持，報吿舉辦國貸展覽商塲之目的，在於引起國人對國貨之注意，以謀與外貨競爭。繼由塲長蔣仲和及工業協會請幹事田和卿等相繼致詞，闡明民族工業瀕放絕境之目前，提倡國貨實屬刻不容緩。市府參事葛克信則謂我國經過長期戰爭之后，都市鄉村遭受破壞頗烈，勝利后，正是工業抬頭擴展之好機會，尤期是美貸充斥全市舊，國貸商塲之成立，意議重大。葛氏詞畢，閉幕典禮即吿完成。明日起，商場木屋即開始拆卸。據該商塲場長蔣仲和稱，爲謀提倡國貨之激底實現起見，必須建造一永久性之展覽商塲，經過多數廠商之會商後，決利用原有之空地，彼等並已與地主接洽，地主極表贊助，關於建造永久性商場事，該會正積極推進中。</p>
<h3>一千數百罪犯　合於赦免例</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市高院地院及兩檢察處，已於昨日上午，接獲載有大赦令之國府公報，內容與元且日本報第一版所登載者相同。因本市法院迄未接到正式大赦命令，僅見諸報端，不能發生法律效用，故以前地院釋放之赦免犯人僅採用交保方式，自今日起，高地兩院對犯罪在民國三十五年十二月三十一日以前，最畫本刑爲有期徒刑以下者，將正式開始赦免。至於減刑部份，則尙待奉到大赦細則後，始能辦理。又悉高院經調查合於赦免條例之罪犯達七百餘名，地院八百六十名，據高院負責人稱，俟減刑詳細辦法頒到後，即可正式公佈姓名。</p>
<p>又訊〕上海監獄連日漏夜趕造囚犯名册，俾便呈報司法行政部，以決定赦免或減刑，該項名册，可關於今晚完成。因每一犯人，均須查出其起訴書，判決書，詳加審核，故手續異常繁複。聞犯人釋出後，獄中囚衣均須脫下繳還，若十貧苦犯人將無衣禦寒，茲有某救濟委員會贈遂該監棉衣四百套，（內男裝三百套，女裝一百套）業經該監點收，另有陳姓律師通知渠亦已經手募集寒衣四百套，贈送該監，惟尙未）送到。此項寒衣對於貧苦犯人，誠可謂爲雪中送炭。</p>

<p>「」在上海特輯　　據說　們中國，是一個以「　」著名的　　，使物質的美，一直　精　的美，然不兼收　　。大魚大肉固然　　，甚至　從事教育，也呌股「　」教　飯，　信教也呌做「　」敎。　　上海道些大都市裏，　　都可以事受你所鹽事受的口福。這原是「　」的都市啊！　　辦完了公，肢副屬路上，想找個　館來填胞壯子，織長的了幾位朋友，想出去低斟個讓一下，若是你對酒館飯店不大然悉的話，你華給眩目的市招，菜餚的香味，攬得　細·酒館飯店，馬路上多的是，什麼廣東菜，北平菜，四川菜，河南菜，甚至印度菜，屬來菜等，五花八門，然而，酒館飯店雖多，良　却有不齊，　着好的，自然僅量享受，滿意而返，磁着不好的，，化了錢還不算，換來了一肚子的不舒服。　　最好，你先打　明自某一家食店是特別擅長某一搬食品，如茶一家以擠爐鴨出名，某一家以炸排骨出名，某一家的麵食特別可口，某一家的咖啡特別講究，打聽明白，那麼在　　飯店時，先已有一個大槪的觀念。　　注意那些門面神氣，　具考究，侍役制服漂亮的餐館，不一定就會有好的寫品，也許裝修外觀的錢，常會在食品方面取償的，有些簡單粗　的食店，倒常會有意外精美的食品，當然，碗碟必須淸潔，地飯桌椅也要乾净，衛生　竟要緊！　　先看門前的菜牌子，菜色是否合你的口味，免得進去坐了下來，却覺得那些菜都不合口味，平添許多麻煩。在食單上，你常會看到不少離奇的菜名：什麽「神仙飯」「爵爺鵝」「踏　　梅」「母女會」等，雖然有些的確美宋，但你應切記你來道裏的目的是吃菜，並不是吃菜的名稱。新奇的菜名，並不一定便是新奇的食品，不要被餐館老閩所玩弄！　　留心你打算進去的菜館，如果聞到一設濃厚的油炸氣味，那麽這是勸你過門不入，因為油炸的東西，烹調起來比較可以馬虎些，迅速些，而且不大新鮮的食物，也可以用油炸來掩飾一下。上等廚司，是常以烤，灸，敦來烹飪的。　　以「舞蹈表演」「名歌手演唱」「爵士音樂」「女招待一等等號召的，不少是是為了，品，足動人的緣故，純粹為了「吃」不必踏入這類餐館，如果為了「聲色自娛」，那富然又作別論。　　總之，你得打定主意，你到菜館中的目的是為了「吃的享受」——其他一切都丟開！「吃」的享受　　要「吃」，晴到上海來！　　俗語說得好：「着在蘇州（一說杭州），吃在在廣州。「不錯，蘇杭乃產綢之區，可是他們的衣着，未必比上海人來得漂亮，華廣·州的吃固然聞名，然而在廣州，也畢竟只能客到本鄉風味·只有上海，纔集「吃」的大成。　　這兒有粵菜館，閩菜館，川菜館，平津館，蘇錫飯館，鎭揚點心，徽州杭州的館子，以及其他各省人開設的館子，應有盡有！這兒可以喫到四川泡菜，喫到廣東的叉燒，喫到南京的板鴨，喫到杭州的酷溜魚，喫到河南的鐵鍋蛋，喫到福建的西施舌，喫到鎭江的煮干絲，喫到江西的甜火腿，喫到…………不諭「南甜北鹹，東酸西辣」，這兒都有！　　這兒有十幾層的大酒店，有本地風光的菜飯館，有裝璜別級的西菜館，有麵食店，有茶食店。小喫，包飯作，咖啡茶座，幾百種不同方式的營業塲所，正在為全市五百萬人的「吃」而活動着　一吃」是人類的本能，是人們必不可少的活動，同時，也是一種享受！一種應有的享受！　　穿着畢挺的西服，在高貴的餐廳裏啃着火鷄腿，和坐在小麵店的長攙上吃着陽春麵，甚至在大餅攤旁嚼着大餅，在「吃」的意義上，是絲毫沒有甚麽不同之處！　舊曆年底又快到了，年夜飯，春酒，家家戶戶又該為着「吃」而忙起來吧！馬路上的菜館更其顯得熱鬧，店門口掛着的鷄　，　陽，也似乎更引誘起行人的食慾。　　誰不想痛快地「吃」一頓？誰不想讓自已的肚子得到最舒服的享受？——若是你的錢袋許可的話。西菜　　凡常住上海的人，除了生活過份低下貧苦的不計外，差不多喜歡跑跑餐館，所謂「吃大菜」是·說起來，西菜確比中菜經濟些，現在一般人家舉辦喜事，也是西菜餐客的較多·不過也有一部分人，以「吃大菜」為榮耀的，這不免帶有要不得的國民劣根性。　　最初上海西菜，不過供應外僑，像禮查，匯中等，都由外僑經營。國人之好時髦者，亦偶而光顧。其後外僑來滬者日增，吃西菜之風，亦較普遍，西菜館相繼創設者不少，其中也有由國人經營的·橘逾淮而為枳，西菜到了上海，已變了質，除由外人指導烹調外，許多中國人所弄的西菜，皆富有本國風味，以配合中國主顧的口味。　　西萊也有許多式樣，正像中國菜有粵·川·徵·閩之分一般。較盛行者，為德國式和法國式。法國本以烹調精美著稱，昔日上海麥瑞西菜，名聞一時，可作為一法國菜的代表。麥瑞停業之後，水上飯店，新都飯店，都假名麥瑞廚司。據說上海西菜名廚，十之八九為麥瑞所傳授。至德國菜在上海，像來喜，華府等，也曾受一部份人歡迎。　　目下上海的西菜館，就其性質言，可約略分為三個區域：福州路西段近跑馬廳一帶，這一類的西菜館，像大西洋，中央，新利查，看　，印度　　飯店等，事假上　一般事業男女　請教，所以它們的生童，大部份在晚上，但也有　　　　的宴會·外　四川　一帶的西菜館，那是多得數不大清楚，有的擬璜考究，氣派輩貴，有的却因　就簡，佈置樸實。這　西菜館的生意，大都靠寫字間裏的人義，所以公司菜的價格，差不多很一律。至於　飛路一帶：完全是俄開菜館的勢力，其他還有散佈各處的小西餐館，那是廣東店的附　品，不能列入西餐館之內。　　目離，西菜業生意還算不錯，尤其是　人崇尙「美化」的時候，「歐美大菜」「　　適口」等的字樣似乎更能吸引閱人了。至於「　　大菜」，則因售價較平民化，　　公務員及學生們所歡迎。三十二圍扦的盛筵　　昔日酒席，注意圍扦，國扦　多，愈足表示其高貴。所謂團扦，乃是水果糖食，上置竹托，陳列四週。最起碼的筵席，祇　四葷盆，不用圍扦，稍　　始有八圍扦，即四　盆之外，再加兩水果兩乾果。更　者十二圍扦：四葷盆，四水果，兩乾果，兩糖食，多則十六團扦：葷盆，水果，乾果，糖食各四碟·每逢喜事款待上　，有事至三十二圍扦者，第碟　拼，名曰「鴛鴦碟」，十六碟成三緒初年，庚子以後，稍殺，圍扦以十六爲度。民國以來，打倒漢錠　，圍扦亦一律撤去。船菜　　船菜向來馳　全國·吳中山明水秀，勝跡如林，從前一班有閒階級，每逢春秋佳日，結伴出遊。城鄉相距稍遠，河港又歧，非舟莫達。於是一舸中流，憑舷細酌，確是雅人雅事。洽菜者多屬船　，頗　烹　之術，菜極精潔。　　從前大加利蘇錫船菜著稱，做得十分細微，不過取價太昂，營業不盛，現已改爲辦喜慶筵席的蘇式菜飯了。後來又有一家緣舫，同以船菜相標榜，今亦關門大吉。這頗有詩意的船菜，目下上海人是無福享受了。雄視同業的粵菜　　粵菜在今日，無疑地是酒菜業中的巨　。本來「吃在廣州」的一句話，是夠誘惑人的了，何況烹調確是精美，「色香味」俱臻上乘，不特廣東人忘不了他們的家鄉風味，即各地的人也無不踴躍欲試。加以粵人長袖善　，扶其雄厚的資本，完善的設備，使粵菜營業，蒸蒸日上。今日上海第一流的菜館，幾乎已是清一色的粵菜館。。尤其是「華」字北輩的幾家酒家，杯盤精緻，排塲闊綽，更足傲視同業。夠得上華貴兩字，但菜價　昂，也不免令人咋舌·二十年前，一席猴腦或烤猪，已非千金不可，照今日的物價算起來，恐須數百尤，甚至數千萬了。廣式菜館原有大小之分，規模宏大，設備華麗的廣東菜館，固然一席千萬，使窮小子望而却步，但也有很簡陋的小館子，照樣可以嘗到粵菜風味，雖然菜有精粗，味有美惡，但價格和大館子比較起來，却「相去不可以道里計」。　　考　式酒家，起先在上海，原不甚發達，像從前在北四川路上的味雅，會元　，西湖樓，洞天等店，規模雖然够偉大但織客只限於旅滬的一粵人而已，外帮人是絕少去光顧的，即是小吃，沒有廣東朋友的領導，也不敢去上宵夜館。　　那時的粵菜館，的略可以分做三種：一種是高等的，如會元，嶺南，西湖等酒；一種是適宜於小酌的，如味雅，檀香之類；又有一種西式的小「大菜」館，在當時也頗受市民的歡迎。除了第三種全市皆有外，其他兩種，都集中在武昌路北四川路一帶，當經濟恐慌的潮流襲擊上海時，一般高級廣式酒家，因為開支浩大，而營業又不振，支持不住，都紛紛改組。次等菜館，便應一運而生，一變以前方針，竭力將一菜價减低，促成其經濟化和零賣一化，果然，在這樣一改革以後，上海人對於粵菜不像從前那樣趣一趄不前了，而粵菜業也就此交上一了好運。　　所以粵菜館的發達，還是不久的事。抗戰發生後，虹口成了特殊區城，本來緊集在那裏的粵菜館，紛紛遷移，南京路和福州路，成為大廣東館的集中地，如新雅，大三元，味雅，冠生園等皆一是。永安，先施，新新，大新四一公司，因主持者全是粵人，所以附設的菜館，均以粵菜爲主，嗣後紅棉，南華，榮華，美華，京華等先後成立，由於設備富麗，資本雄厚，經營又得法，業務　　日上。甚至要找一家宴會塲所，非到粵菜館中去找不可，第一流的館子，幾為粵菜業所包辦。像金門，康樂，紅棉，大三元，新雅，美華，新都，杏華樓，南國，大東，萬壽山，五層樓，京華，榮華，新華等，均粵菜館中之佼佼者，國際飯店的中菜，也為於粵菜一派，其中以杏花樓的歷史為是悠久，迄今巳三十年了·至於中等以下的粵菜館，那是一每一條較熱鬧的馬路上，都有一一兩家，愛多亞路一帶，滿目皆是，勝利後的北四川路，小型的粵菜館，也恢復了戰前的盛况。一其次該講粵菜的內容了。粵菜烹調精緻，早巳膾炙人口，像魚翹，鮑魚，信豐鷄等，有口皆碑，不必細說，幾樣炒菜，不僅味鮮可口，即顏色之美，亦令人垂涎欲滴。幾個名手廚司，更是花樣百出，假如有人每天去吃他四樣，在一個月內，決不會炒「冷飯」·冷盤在粵菜中雖不十分謂究，但柱候鹵味，明爐又燒，也是大家所熟知的。其實在廣東，吃的東西很多，果品中的茘子，柑橘，稱為珍品，點心中的又燒包，茶食中的盲公餅，也頗特異，不僅在菜餚上出名也。　　粵菜之得名，不在「精」，而在「奇」，貓狗蛇猴，均為佐餐佳肴，尤其是蛇肉，可以煮出許多名稱來：如同鷄合煮的，「呌「龍鳳會」，同菓子貍合煮呌「龍虎會」，有用三種蛇合煮的呌一「三蛇會」在廣東館子門前，一時常可以看到「今日準宰金錢豹一」等的字牌，這就是通知顧客本日有新鮮蛇應市。　　據善於吃蛇的廣東人說，蛇肉一非常鮮美，並有　風，去寒，活血，强身，潤膚的功效，所以每到冬令，非吃不可。在粵菜館的玻璃櫥窗內，常有蛇陳列着，電　地在鐵絲籠中活動，外鄉人看了不免胆怯，但他們却司空見慣。剝了皮的蛇肉，潔白肥嫩，使粵籍老曁們垂涎三尺。蛇胆又能明目，對於人體，大有裨益，一杯膏漿，滴上幾滴胆汁，那碧緣的顏色，也是怪動人的。廣東本有一種轉吃蛇胆的風氣，其法將活蛇用很純熟的手法，把他的組取出來，說來令人可佈。　　　和猴子，是粵菜中的珍品·在那些專賣野味的廣東館子中，用着廣吿，大大地宣傳，「今日一宰猴大王」，「敎補老黑　」上市，用紅紙寫着斗大的字，在門口張貼着。吃猴腦是很慘的一件事，一張中央開洞的桌子，猴頭　露在外面，那圓溜溜的眼睛，向四周的座客呆看，尙不知死之將至。其時用鐵鎚，將天靈蓋擊破，大家用匙來勺腦汁吃，那猴子的哀鳴，有點「聞其聲而不忍食其肉」，但好嘗異味者，却滿　　其他如龍風，桂花　，禾蟲等，都是難看得怕人的東西，但粵菜中亦視同珍品·「吃在廣東」，斯言非　·而粵菜館遍設於海內外，旣因粵人善於經營，復因菜多特色，營業發達豈偶然哉！教門館中　涮羊肉　　回激捷不需會　通菜鉉裏的由一　，於是有專為回敎徒而設的菜館，稱為敎門館，如春華樓是也·那裏一切連照教門規則，菜肴是很潔净的。　　敎門館以牛羊肉聞名，尤其在這吃羊肉的季節，像南來噸，洪長與的涮肉，頗為人所稱道。爐火熊熊，濃湯欲沸之時，把紅白相同的花肥羊肉，用筷挾着，在沸湯裏涮上一涮，潰着醬油，醬豆腐　，和其他酸辣香甜的住味材料，自然芬芳撲鼻。此時一杯酒，一　肉，且食且飲且談，眞是「此中有眞味，欲辨巳忘言」了。異軍突起的　川菜　　川菜的特性，盡人皆知，那種特別的辛辣味，刺激着食客的味覺，使人喫起來覺得又舒服又好像有點離過，有時甚至吃到舌頭癢，嘴巴痛，眼淚直淌，但是還捨不得放下筷子，這便是川菜的魔力·這一層，上過四川館子的人教領略過·川菜中自然也有一些沒有辛辣味的，但因爲烹調的別緻，同樣有他的特性，這對於喫慣了本地菜的上海人拿來換換口味倒是挺不錯的。據說，有些川菜館裏，還不時有外國主織光臨！　　川菜在上海流行，僅不通十年間事，可是他那淸腴辛辣的滋味，已誘惑了不放人。有一度居然在爲最時髦的菜館，素爲上海人所歡迎的粵菜，反屈居其下。現在川菜勢力，雖已退居粵菜之下，但仍不失爲菜業中的一支動旅在昔川菜全盛時代，廣西路小花園一帶，有好幾家川菜館，華格果路入他橋一帶，竟變爲川菜館的天下。每富華燈初上之時，車水馬龍，座客常滿。川菜最早成名的是「都益處」，那時的雜震動了上海的老曁們。此後廣西路的「蜀腴」，華格果路的「錦江」等，相繼而起，於是別有風味的川菜，纔爲滬人所重，香穌鴨，貴妃鷄等幾味名菜，便流行一時了。　　川菜館裏，女老閣獨多，錦江經理童竹君，原籥江蘇，于歸四川，故以川菜聞名·梅龍鎭上座客，頗多藝術界中人物，這是因為女主人吳湄，有聲於話劇界的綠故。新仙林隔壁的上海酒樓，也是女主人，乃　家朱爾貞朱蘊靑所股立，胞術家和川菜有　，她們都是有修養的人，經營方法，當然與衆不同。　　川菜不鐵別有呈味，即名色也十分別織·像「姑姑鐵」，就是一個很動人的名詞，在抗戰幾年中，轟動了整個山城，西上避　的下江人，一有錢都要想嘗些具味。姑姑籲是一位名呌王老太爺所創製的，他曾做暹一任知縣，當過前淸慈禧太后的御廣，燒得一手好菜，可是菜雖做得好，　氣却很特別，他又不靠此營生，高典時答應下來，不高興時便拒絕了。復目則特別昂賣，在抗織初年，每席已非三數十元至五六百元不辦，但據說不論貴賤。菜實在是差不多的，不過沒有一樣不可口，沒有一樣不出人意外而已。這位王老太爺，的確是易牙再世。可惜現已去世，但姑姑筵却巳搬到了酒菜館中，誰都可以問津了。　　揚州地鐵長江運河之交，昔日海運未通之時，實為交通要　，又是　商　集之地，故飲食亦極講究，搬饞點心，莫不精美·上海亦有揚州菜館幾家，大都兼賣點心，而點心營乘，反勝於菜餚。近來揚點和川菜，好似結了不解之　，有幾家川菜館，　緣楊村等，大都兼賣揚州點心，「揚點川菜」，合為一詞，人人皆知。成都的小吃，也是很有名的，他們為什麽不賣川點呢，是上海人不歡迎麽？上海人好嘗異味，經營川菜的老闆們，大可一試。北平菜　　早年的上海，民風　儉，菜館除本帮外，祇有徵寗兩帮。直至租界開闢，始有各地菜館，其中以北平菜，當時稱爲「京菜一，營業最盛，取徵館之地位而代之，官塲酬酢，京菜最宜。首創者爲新樓，在今南京新新公司對面，此乃同治年間事。北平菜在上海，即在其時奠定基礎。　　平菜館的營業，日盛一日，相繼開設者亦漸多，至民國初年，四個馬路一事實，幾乎全是平菜館的世界·直至粵菜館興起，　良營業方式，貪客遂捨平菜而　粵菜，平采營業，逐漸下落，但今日平菜在上海，仍有一部份勢力。如規模較大，年代很久的會賓樓，悅賓樓等，已設法改良，兼顧外表，不單從質的方面取勝了。　　「南甜北鹹，」平菜以味鹹為主。但事實上，並沒有平菜這一種特別菜色，祇民當初北平乃「帝王之都」，開封·廣州。四川。揚州。福建等各地特色的廚師都匯集一地，各使手段，在王侯之家，爭個高低。結果逐漸受了城市風的洗鍊，製出了非在平菜館中就喫不到的口味。譬如像開封的名菜，倘到開封本地去吃，却只能嘗到粗劣的鄉下味道，斷沒有平菜館中煮得考究入味。其實滬上平菜，乃是山東菜而不是北平菜，山東菜又分登州和濟南二　　，上海平菜乃登州菜的變相，去其糟粕，存其精華而已。　　平菜自受粵菜打擊後，竭力改良，終不能恢復昔日之盛。然大宴會中，平菜雖敵不過粵菜，可是在小吃方面，却足與粵菜匹敵，此川菜要有勢力得多。平津食品，以麵食爲主，售麵食而兼售菜肴的，不知有幾百家，其中三和樓規模最大。中的小的，遍佈在大世界附近，門口掛着黨臘，煮着鍋貼，蒸氣騰　，十分熱鬧。老吃客，一定還知道一月甚爲著名的平津小吃館，叫做「吉昇棧門前的小館子」，在福建路福州路南的一個弄堂裏，因弄內開着一　吉昇棧房，故有此稱，其本名為「福　居」，反而不為人所知。上流社會的人，不因其設備簡陋而　足。店裘還保持數十年前平津館的的習俗，沒有賬單，全靠黨　口報。徽菜　在沒落途中　　「無微不成鎭」的黃金時代，早已過去，上海的微館，也漸趨沒落了。不過徽館在上海，已有很悠久的歷史，在平菜未盛行前，全是微菜的天下。今日徽館因抱薄利多賣主義，故仍擁有不少顧客。　　徽館的範圍，總是不大不小，介乎中庸之間。在上海，徽館的蹤跡，是不難找的，這類館子中，有一特色，就是裏面除却廚房間的庖丁以外，其餘賬房間，跑堂，打雜夥計等，無一不是徽州人，有着濃重的地方風味和保守氣息。　　徽飽裏最擅煎炒的拿手菜，是淸炒２背，炒划水，炒　腰，炒鷄片，醋溜黃魚，煨海參，走油拆燉，紅燒鷄，三絲湯等。如果踏進微菜館要點菜的話，上列各菜，能着各人的胃口點去，確是他們的拿手傑作。　　當徽館全盛時代，滬人宴客，不用全翅，而以三絲三鮮為主菜。三絲刀鋒齊整，湯汁濃鮮，略加魚翅者稱為翅絲，價較昻貴，配置則特別精緻。三鮮中魚圓嫩而肉圓細，入口即化，配以海參，謂之參鮮，火候到家，故不生活硬。皆是徽菜精品。　　一般徽館在早午兩時，還帶做些麵點生意，像火鷄麵，划水麵，鮮湯螺仁鍋麵等，東西很這地，而價錢也想當克己，老饗們最為歡迎。遵有一種特別菜，即大血湯，燒得非常道地，據說，這血湯收入是歸入夥計名下的，由老闆整本，賣下來的錢，除去了本錢，利益由夥計們分拆，所以夥計們對於大血湯的生意，特別馬結一些。　　上海的徽州菜館，早年南市大舖樓，與前法租界的醉白園均頗有名，其萃樓及聚賓樓和聚樂　國，皆在其後，尤以大館樓開設最先，迄今已百餘年。起先設在龍德檔如意街北口，局面不甚堂良，座上每常客滿，後來又添設分館於中奉路大購頭大街四口，小吃如炒　常，紅燒圓菜，　爪湯及冬令的羊膏等，別具　味，尤以麵點著稱於時，又創行「蝴蝶麵」，足數三人飽餐，非常便宜，各徵館亦均見而效之。　　近年來上　的菜館酒縴，有了很大的改革，經濟菜和便宜菜，普遍流行市上，這對於徽館最爲不利，而且一般經營搬館的，大都條守寫主，不思改遺，因比醫乘日趨　落，其勢力已建不如徒前之盛了。現存徽館，較著名的有大富貴，老大中華及鼎新樓　家。杭州菜及其他　　杭州西潮，名聞　這，「　魚」「　菜」便占了西湖的光，論其滋味，確有動人的地方，凡是遊客，總得上樓外樓去嘗他一嘗，滬杭雖近在咫尺，但從前上海人對於杭州菜，却不大注意，早年大世界畔的杭州飯莊，大家不過認作一爿通常菜館。自杭州天杳樓到上海來設立分店後，杭菜始為滬人所嗜？本來天香樓在杭州，是挺有名的，上海分店，因此也同杭州一樣的熱鬧。還有石路上的知味觀，也以杭菜號召，生涯頗不惡。　　閩菜在上海，雖僅曇花一現，但也露過頭角。那時的小有天，經淸道人的賞識，一班遣老們，把他當作「西山」，朝朝「寒食』，夜夜元宵。論閩菜本有特點，善用海鮮，可惜現在已無人了」。　　鎭江亦通商大埠，吃的一道，並不後人。硝肉勝於火腿。獅子頭到口即融，不煩細嚼，可惜油膩得利害。現在上海的鎭江館子，較大的只剩了老半齋一家。新半齋已改換牌號了。世界食譜誌異　　在茅立鐵司與麥拉排地方的人，吃一種蝙蝠，長尺許。　　義大利人的食譜裏，有狐肉一項。　　火坦托司人吃　肉，屬來半島的土人吃虎肉，　　猶太人所吃的東西，在讓　利朱記中所記的，有　炸，　　，蚱蜢。所謂滿漢筵席　　從前酒菜館的門口，都　着「滿漢筵席」的市招。考滿漢席本分等級。滿席分六等，一等滿寫：用麵一百二十斤，物品為玉露霜，方酥，夾韜各四盤，白賽印子，鶉蛋印子各一盤，黃白點子松餅各兩盤，盒圓例用大　靜六盤，不　　二盤，紅白　子三盤，乾果十二盤，鮮果六盤，磗　一碟，陳設高一尺五寸。漢席亦分三等，一等漢席有：鵝魚鶉鴨猪肉等三十二　，果食八　，　食三盤，蔬菜四盤。　　普通酒菜館中的所謂滿漢筵席，乃漢菜以外，另加滿菜，然所謂滿菜，已僅有處名。從前請新親上門時所用的燒烤席，或者即是滿菜。燒烤席之前半席，皆為漢菜，至燒烤登筵，憶席者在客座前，換上泰　杯，大如胡，滿斟燒酒於中·四角分置大　甜醬各兩碟，中央另置薄餅兩大碟，然後送上燒猪四盤，兩肥　精，烤鴨四盤，薄批成片。同時再進滿茶一道，杯為點錫所製，外鑲紅木，杯中滿裝蓮子·桂園·松子·瓜仁·棗仁等物。頂　紅緣色拮皮絲，外觀頭美，座客不過沾脣而已·食燒烤畢，又易熬茶一道，味鹹，似為靑豆釀成，略加牛乳，此即北人所嗜之奶子茶。所謂「滿漢全席」，如是而已。各國人的胃口　　（一）中國人喜歡吃猪肉。　　（二）英國人宣歡吃火腿。　　（三）美國人喜歡吃巧克力。　　（四）法國人喜歡吃蝸牛。　　（五）土耳其人喜歡吃烟。　　（六）巴西人喜歡吃咖啡。　　（七）德國人喜歡吃啤酒。　　（八）義大利人喜歡吃牛油。　　（九）印度人喜歡吃咖喱。　　（十）日本人喜歡吃生魚。　　（十）（一）阿根廷人喜歡吃牛肉。　　（十）（二）安南人喜歡吃檳榔。</p>

<p>出版界每星期四出版評「中國經濟的分析與改造」  丁經章　　胡沂生著　世界書局出版　　　在勝利後衰頹貧乏的中國出版界，所見到的不是色情文藝，便是些攻訐漫屬，學術性的著述，很是少見，有之也只是雖零狗碎的意見，有系統結構的著作，絕無僅有，這不庸說是戰後種種原因阻碍了中國出版界的正常發展，而此種事實給與今後中國民智民德的影響，至重且鉅，我們不禁深以爲憂！　　前月我以赴滬之便，得購續世界書局出版胡沂生著「中國經濟的分析與改造」，費三日之力，通讀一過，認爲雖不能爲經濟巨著，但列論自成系統，所見確中時弊，在目下中國出版界確屬難能可貴，全書內容分成分析與改迭二方面，前者以史學家之眼光闡明中國經濟之過去與現在，後者則以充分之例證說明中國將來應採之經濟政策，而尤其値得我們注意的，便是後者經濟政策部份，他毫不客氣地指出戰後中國經濟之紊亂係山於政府之失策與民間趨向之混亂，長此以往，可能招致戰爭勝利建設失敗之局面。但他並不祗消極的指出缺陷，更積極約有所主張，「謂能及時補救則事非不可爲」。他的主張怎樣呢？在序論裏很明白地指出：「結論認爲國父遺敎應爲中國經濟建設之最高指標，而於現階段則應採重產抑商政策，即振興工業，保護農業，抑制商業，管理貿易，使全國人力物力資力集中於生產建設，對此計劃的生產又須計劃的分配，使國民生活幸福優裕而期三民主義中民享之可以充分實現」。　　自由經濟　是否適合中國　　這短短幾句就是說明其所主張和全書的主要內容，他的思想構造是立脚在三民主義的思想體系上，而對這三民主義的解釋，又明白地指出絕非自由經濟而是以「統制」爲要件之計劃經濟，經過八載抗戰，國民因經濟的統制而受盡物質生活的限制，所以一聽「統制」，便感頭痛，追逐「自由」，勢所必然，本著却指出：民間趨向往往是盲目的，趨於近利的，雖有背國父遺敎而不自覺：試問：節制資本是自由經濟的範疇嗎？平均地權是自由經濟的範疇嗎？設是自由經濟則資本不容節制，地權不容平均，這眞是一針見血的見解，民間趨向已突，我們所最不明白的身爲黨員身爲負責全國經濟重任的政府要員還多曲解三民主義是自由主義，資本主義！　　我認爲那一種經濟體制最能擴充載後中國經濟生產力，使中國由不足而至富足，國民生計由貧苦而至幸福，那種經濟體制便是良制。現在中國實施自由經濟的結果，不但不能擴充生產力，即旣存生產力也日就萎疲！停頓日日聞，倒帳處處是，這嚴然的事實最足證明自由經濟不但有背　　國父遺敎，即對中國現實也不適合。現在中國盛倡民主，但我們絕不能把民主政治與自由經濟混作一談。在政治言民主，在經濟須計劃，胡君所著能正確予以把握，眞有空谷　音之感？　　重產抑商　著者一個建議　　本著重點在闡明重產抑商政策，中國古有重農抑商政策，今有重產抑商政策，先後相映成趣，重產的內容是振興工業，保護農業，這是衆見一政，沒有問題的，抑商的內容是抑制商業，公然主張尙屬少見，政府要員有所發表，須面面俱到，所以祗會有「振興工商」「救濟工商」，不會有「抑商」，而要員又多兼營商業，「抑商」更難於啓口，但著者却以「抑商」爲基主要內容，他說明中國商業：「第一，從它的性格上說是崎形的商業，它自五口通商以來即列入侵華機構的一環，促成中國經濟的半殖民地性格；第二，從它對國民經濟的比重說總是太大，試問資本之葉中於商業者究多少？貸放於農村的高利又多少？爲掮客業者若干人？專靠投機營生者又若有十人？我們不問恐慌期抑景氣期都得以「太多」兩字答之，其過度的發展就個人說，自然有損有益，就全體說，却決定的是有損無益。」抑商在今日中國確有共必要，中國商業的畸形性存在則中國商業愈是發展，中國血液愈被吸吮以去，愈是國弱民貧，中國商業的過度性存在則它一方面使生產者成木加重而壓抑生產者，它方面使物價昻貴而壓抑消費者，我們知道美國的國富增加是山於商業發展，可是它的商業是貿易上的發展，並不是對內的榨取，現今先進國家不問美國或蘇聯，其商業對內的地位日就减削，在美國：（一）工業侵入商業領域，大規模生產機構都附設門市部；（二）大經營合併中小經營，如百貨店與連鎖店之發達使零售商業領域縮小；　合作社發展，直接排除商人之介在。在蘇聯：國營和合作社的商業機構的積極發展，私人商業已逐漸淘汰幾至於零，也獲得社會主義化的效果，但我國商業却在整個萎疲的經濟園地裏會獨繁特茂」　　畸形發展　可以是解糾正　　政策的意義不在敷衍現實，也不是現實的法規化，須領導現實，糾正現實，在這裏才有着政策的意義，著者對中國商業畸形的過度的發展現實，儼然主張抑商，不失爲切中時弊的改造意見，我們希望政府能予推行，這不但中國經濟由此可以轉入新機，即中國商業自身也蒙其利，不致再像今日高喊商業危機了。　　對於抑商的方法，本著也予提及，認爲商業畸形發展的緣由不外：（一）廻轉率快，（二）利潤率大，（三）可以投機，（四個）輕而易舉，（五）安全性較農工爲大，其中商　利潤的最大尤其是最根本的原因，所以以言抑商尤須以抑制商業利潤爲主要內容，抑制商業利潤的過高，「可於以下二法中進　其一；一是事前的抑制，即根據成一本加人一定的商業利潤求出販賣公定價格以作買賣時的準備，販賣價格當然還有批發與　售之別，此制實現，將從來的自由價格一制度打破無餘，從來的自由價格一決定於供需關係，而個人商業活一動則依最大利潤的原則，成本求共最低，販賣價格求其最高，以求其差額利潤之最大，今販賣價格予以固定，自與市塲的供需關係無關，而商業利潤旣參照產業利潤決定，其與從前之最大利潤向也不同，實質上成了手續費或佣金的性質了。二是事後的抑制，即商業活動，一切一任故舊，其利潤率也不加限制或干涉，但對其營利結果的所得，課以累進率的極重的所得稅，超過某一限度的稅率爲百分之百。」在目下中國採用後者的可能較大，可是欲期擴充最大的經濟生產力，則務須採用前者使商業與產業的對立性减至最低，而一切產業生產均根據「需要原則」以代替從來之「營利原則」，一步步走上計一劃經濟的大道。　　對於抑商的方法本著言之甚簡，我股望著者能作進一步的研究，加深造詣，我相信給與中國經濟前途的影響是很大的。（完）中國擦劇運動  納雅　　著作者：田　　　出版者：商務印書館　　版期：三十五年六月　　目前中國的戲劇運動，是趨於低潮底時期，這祗要看看事實，就會明白。而在過去中國　劇運動，是有一段轟轟烈列的奮鬥史，由於這一政奮鬥史，才促成了中國新劇的基石。因之，道光　的一　，是我們所要知道的，並且有推動這中國劇運的任務，使它仍對着蓬勃底一方面轉向。　　這迫切的任務，不庸我們再忽視，因爲戲劇是有時代的推動性的——它對廣大的人民起相當大的宣傳作用；如果中國的戲劇一蹶不振，則上海將形成一個醉生夢死的世界。忘記了祖國正待復興。　　促成戲劇運動前進蓬勃的使命，是生在大衆的眼前，需要大家把它培植而發榮滋長。　　田禽的這本「中國戲劇運動」，是說明了過去劇運底一頁，寫得也較正確明淨。正如作者所說：「我不敢誇口我寫的這些東西怎樣正確，然而我從着筆到結果止，始終保持着客觀的態度，從不敢塗抹上一層主觀的色彩，致造成偏頗的論調。」　　的確，在這本集子裘，所說的種種是站在戲劇的立脚點上出發，公正地去述明過去的時代。　中國的新劇，無論在編劇，導演。表現。舞台裝置上，各方面是有了進步，而戲劇家們，正需把握道一成功，辛勤地，勞苦地，去努力耕耘。至於戲劇批評家的正確批評，也應該接受，正如聖經所說：「你只看到你弟兄的眼裏有刺，而沒有注意自己眼裏有梁木。」在於批評家方而，則是：「批評家之成功與失敗，是在他所有的眞理底永久，以及他傳述眞理的技術。」這種搜術，才是眞正的態度。　　戲劇是時代的鏡子，它所反映的是時代的精神。在「七七」之後，中國劇壇萌育了『抗戰劇」的花朶，並且盛開着·書中也有說到戰時戲劇創作之演變，而較詳地舉例述出這一時代的劇運　　至於中國戲劇理論建設，它說出戰前戲劇運動的收獲，戰率戲劇理論建設的鳥瞰。中國劇作家方面，它指曹禺錯誤點是「宿命論」，而改正這錯誤，是有他的前途的。其餘郭沫若·夏衍·熊佛西·陳白塵·洪深·侯曜·田漢。歐陽予倩。丁西林·宋之的。允競等，均予以分別的批評和介紹。女劇作家方面的丁玲·白薇·濮舜卿·趙淸閣等，也寫到論到。　　「中國戲劇運動的路向」一文，更吿訴我們這運動的開始與實踐。五四時代是思想革命時代，新的怒潮爲這一新時代的人們施了洗禮。那時起，舊時代的枷鎖打碎了，吃人的舊禮敎經這巨浪的冲刷，也就逐漸的被淹沒殆盡。當時受封建社會和軍閥淫威的桎梏，外來帝國主義的欺凌壓迫，而道新時代的思潮，更飛躍地洶湧澎湃於全國。　　戲劇運動，也隨着這新時代而漸漸滋長，此後，「戲劇大衆化」，農村演劇運動的推動，成畸形的發展。現在，正需改正這畸形。這改進演劇，作者有四點意見：一·捐除己見加强團結；二·展開募集新劇塲建築基金運動；三·擴大軍中演劇工作；四·發揚初期的幹戲精神。這四點意見，正可作現在演劇運動的座右銘。　　最後，作者將三十年來戲劇的繙譯作一比較，詳細地列表說明。　　這新演劇運動已經是三十年光榮底歷史，戰前是建立了可貴的文學底建設和實踐。到目前，受着「美化」而略衰，戲劇工作者和觀衆們，快迎頭趕上去！錢鐘書一長篇　列入晨光業書　　晨光出版公司編印之晨光文學叢書，最近所出之老舍創作惶惑，偸生及巴金之第四病室等，聞頗受歡迎。該叢書第二批新書已付排者，有巴金之長篇創作寒夜及錢鐘書之長篇小說圍城，該兩大長篇均曾速載於一九四六年之文藝復興月刊，爲去年度最受好評之長篇小說。學習的衘道  傅統先　　西方有一句俗話說，沒有一條御道可以求到學問。我們相信這句話。我們覺得做學問應該用切磋琢磨的工夫。所以一向個人最懷疑「英文一月通」，「作文模範」一類書的效用。　　最近編者接到一位讀者的來信，說明他將在高中畢業，爲了準備畢業考試，希望把三年所學習過的功課加以複習。祗是因爲抗戰期間學業受了戰爭的影響，各方面都覺得很差。他覺得英文程度允不行。希望我們介紹一本優良的中學生輔導書。同時據我們從一位高中生的來函觀察起來，我們對於他的國文也抱有相當的杞憂。　　編者這些年來都是和靑年學生在一起，對於他們這種苦悶深表同情，而對於這位來函的讀者的誠懇坦白的態度尤為感動。一般的講起來中學畢業生在各方面的程度都够不上標準。這種現象，我們以爲第一是戰爭的結果，第二是辦敎育的人也應該負責，第三纔是有關於書本的問題。　在戰爭期間老實說學校與其說是一個求學的地方，還不如說是一個敎師謀生計的地方。無論是負責學校行政的人或負責敎學的人當時心目中求生是第一件事，敎育成功了一種工具。所以對於學生的教學管理都幾乎無暇顧及。這類的學校，我們希望它們現在趕緊回過頭來多多替靑年學生着想。例如對於畢業班的同學特別予以複習的指導，不要讓他們像迷途的羔羊似的，徬徨無主。　　其次，我們對於一般所用的敎科書也表示不滿，其內容祗有骨骼面沒有血肉，那些抽象而不切實際活的材料怎樣能使靑年自己領會呢？至於一般的自習輔導書更是骨骼之架格，恐怕連人影都找不到了。靑年們想到這一方面去淘金恐怕希望不大。不得已求其次，還是請你們揀幾本較好的敎科書從頭至尾的複習，多花一些工夫，不懂的向老師們去求敎，這倒比較是一條容易的路。　　最後關於語言文字的訓練這絕不是短時間所能奏效的。無論國文或英文祗要平常簡易的材料讀得多，寫得多，講得多，日久自然會通，但千萬不能好高驚遠，貪多嚼不下，語言學習更找不到一條御道。　　屠格涅夫的「春潮」  宇文潔　　正如屠格湼夫的其他小說一樣，一個細緻的性格描寫在他的生花之筆下，更活龍活現地顯露在我們面前了，而那裏面又蘊藏着無窮的眞諦，要我們去探索，去體味。猶如喝一口葡萄美酒後的甜醇，使人感到那末美好的回味而追求於無窮盡。　　人生畢竟是多變的，在生之旅途上匆匆來去，誰疏忽於一剎之間，就把幸福從自己的手指縫中蹤去，那末，羞憤與懊喪，滿苦與懺悔，焦急與暴燥，一連串回憶的毒蛇將永）遠噬傷他負疚的心靈，他將帶着無比的遺恨，爬進自己的墳墓。　　「春潮」里的主角薩寗不就是這樣一個人嗎？　　故事的內容兄這樣的：　　說是在法萊克福，一個年靑的過路客薩寗，由於上火車時間還早，無意中踱進了大街旁的一家糖果店，那里的主人是個意大利寡婦，那天她正巧出去了，在薩寗走進店里的當兒，那寡婦的兒子兒突然昏舉了過去，於是她女兒吉瑪急忙懇求關寗救治，事後女主人回來了，她和她的女兒都很感覺他，晚上留他吃飯，這樣把他搭車的時間躭誤了。　　吉瑪—薩寗第一次看見就驚異她出奇美麗的姑娘的未婚夫，一個道貌岸然的布店店員總管，一個德國人，知道了這件事，也來到薩寗的寓所致謝，他的着薩寗和吉瑪愛彌兒一起郊遊，薩寗欣然接受了道個邀請。　　翌日，他們遠足去了，顯然地吉瑪已不像他在店里遇見時那樣地活潑了，她未婚夫的一本正經的紳士氣的束了每個人，遊覽興趣大爲减低，偏偏在山上酒館內進餐時，吉瑪被一個薰醉的德國軍官所侮尋，她未婚夫憤然地要求大家停止進餐而歸家，吉瑪的臉色氣很慘白，薩寗怒不可過地走過去，給那軍官一個相當的責駡，却換得了決鬥的挑戰。　　薩寗對此沒有顧慮，但在已不滿意於自己未婚夫的市儈氣和假正經的吉瑪看來，該是多麼地感動啊！當後來她知道薩寗安全地決鬥歸來時，她堅決的向她母親要求解除和那個紳士式的店員總管的婚的。　　薩寗是愛吉瑪的，他終於取而代之，成爲吉瑪的未婚夫，爲了這點，他必須回去賣掉他在俄國的僅有的幾畝田，恰巧在那時，他遇見了小時的同學頗洛佐夫，他太太是很有錢的，他答應和薩寗一起去巴黎向他太太辦理售下薩寗的田。　　吉瑪鼓勵薩寗去，但希望他辦完手續拿了錢就回來。　　到巴黎時，薩寗遇見了頗洛佐夫太太，一位美艷的年青的貴婦，起先薩寗還想念着吉瑪，誰知在頗洛佐夫太太挽留着陪她玩二天中，僅僅是二天的誘惑，年輕而缺乏世故的薩寗不自持地跪在她的面前，成了她的感情的奴隸，忘掉了再回吉處，連行李也是偸偸地差人去拿的。　　在他生之跋涉中，受盡了顚沛，直至老年，薩寗還是孤獨的，爲了債還他的宿債，他又去法萊克福，但吉瑪已去紐約嫁了人，生了孩子，她媽媽死了，弟弟愛　兒在衛國戰爭中死去，當她接到薩寗的懺悔的信後，她回信給他說，她沒有恨他，反而感謝他，至少使她擺脫了市儈的婚姻的覊絆，在他離開她的最初幾日，也許過的很艱難，但現在她和她丈夫過了廿餘年美滿的生活，並寄了一張和她很像的她女兒的照片，吿訴他，最近她女兒要和別人訂婚了…………　　年靑的朋友，人生的悲劇不是往往在一瞬問的錯覺和意志薄弱中造成的嗎？愛情亦和事業一樣，成功的果實永遠地屬於堅貞不拔的戰士的，「春潮」該使我們有所警惕的吧！　　我鄭重地把它介紹給你們！</p>

<p>自由談	北極探險記  建華　　英倫北極探險隊出發不久，美國南極探險隊繼續出發，現在途中，將來定有新的紀錄。這是英倫金星探險隊，新從北極歸來的，隊長摩士畢克的報吿。　　冰山兀立　　一九四六年八月八日，我們出發到現在，已經三星期了。今天行經北冰洋的卡唐嘉河，沿途冰山元立，閃爍的光彩，非常觸目。海濱有耐寒的水鳥，結隊飛過，像天空中飛舞的雪團。我們三大艦，向着監狐島前進，上流時有冰塊衝來，假使沒有遠測冰流儀器，艦身也許要遭受損壞。艦行三晝夜，始達藍狐鳥，售風怒吼，氣候更覺冷了。這裏是捕鯨老的目的地，但在我們到達的時候，並無捕鯨船隻，也沒有見到任何國旗。　　離開藍狐島北進時，洋面常有濃霧，我們雖然勇氣百倍，但是鼓浪汪洋大霧中問，一面不免心悸，一面在家聚精會神，避免危險。一日大義忽散，遙見一黑點，我們歡呼前進，好像發現了新大陸一樣，駛近黑點，原來是一個無名的小島。海象成羣，在波濤中翻騰出沒·我們設法上陸，在島上樹立了一塊預製的鐵質路牌，上書「英倫金星探險隊尋獲本土」。　　滿目荒涼　　康斯爾島，相傳爲黃金的生產地，全鳥面積約二千餘方哩，地廣人無，荒凉滿目。我們到達以後，在島上架起帳幕，因冷氣逼人，輪流圍火取暖，並分五小隊，入山探索，隊員維爾克斯尋得一巨塊的土金，葛立透也得一塊，計兩人所得，達四個啓羅六十格蘭姆，其他隊員祗知島產狐狸外，一無所得。不過旣有土金，如能大規模的採掘，必得好的成績。十月十九日，是我的生辰，我們正在飲酒取樂，忽聞砲聲，隊員們都喜極大呼，因我們先得無綫報吿，金星第二探險隊，也追踪趕到了。　　第二大隊，有艦五艘，連我們的三艘，共計八艘。我們在島上植立金星隊路牌後，離去康斯爾島，一直北進。現在我們聲勢浩大，增加了不少勇氣。海行五日，蘭推克艦被冰流撞傷，幸在左舷繫有大木十五株，否則，也許遭到極大危險。一日抵斐的來巫島（Viti　Levu），這島由二百五十餘小島合成，面積七千四百三十四方哩，其中最大的，就是斐的來巫島。我們決議登陸滿山冰雪，沒有道路可走，冷風凜冽，有墮指裂膚的可能。我們行經一深谷，隊員們斗見谷底有帳幕，不覺驚呌起來，這時各人態度若狂，血熱如沸，奔至谷底，只見一架破碎的大型飛機，並非帳幕，飛機內外，發現十五其殘缺不全的骷髏，白骨散地，景家似可怖的魔窟。我們回憶塔斯社披露飛機失踪消息，也許就是這一架，我們表示憐惜同情外，並欽佩他們的雄心。於是我們檢收殘骸，掘地埋葬，加上了一個十字架。　　一無所得　　這個不幸事件，增加了我們前進的決心。但是北進不滿五天，却使我們無法再進，實因前途滿佈着冰排冰塊，沒有間隙可走，我們開砲二百餘發，也不能轟開航路，而且各艦上面，都穿了一層冰的外套，又使我們步履艱難，束手無策。現在我們雖尙有半年的食糧，但是逗留冰洋中，決非善策，所以旣不能進，只有速退。八艦馳進特望波脫（Devonport）時，受到　萬人的歡迎，可是我們捫心自問，此行一無所得，很覺慚愧！（譯自本期世界週刋）早茶總統的出身  良譯自本月號「）　　假使你有野心想做總統的話，最好是讀法律。在美國，獲得總統高位的三十二個男人中，有十九個人，在未登政治舞台之前，是法律界中相當活躍的人物。五個是農夫，兩個是軍人，其餘的六個包括一個裁縫師傅，一個作家，一個敎育家，一個編輯先生，一個工程師，以及一個布匹零　　　。上海橫斷面叫化子迎春（上）  黃喜謨　　在魚曆年底和新年的二十日中，是乞丐們的黃這吉日。乞丐是封建傳統留下來的垃圾，他們是祖傳奉行農　的。在這期間家家戶戶都在準做過年，誰也不情願和乞丐惹氣，以致引起了不吉祥的呌駡。於是只好佈施，毫無猶豫地佈施。乞丐們也投機地唱奏各種應市的歌曲，以博取施主們的歡心，而造成了周遭的喜氣。在道季節的乞討花樣與唱詞，與平時截然不同。因爲一年祗好利用一度，這現象在本埠是可以看得到的。　　掉灶王　　在臘底送灶神的日期，有一種「掉灶王」的　曲，乃是女流乞丐的專利表演，於是乞丐戶的全部娘兒們都全體出動，　她們打扮得極風騷，滿面塗着紅脂白粉，頭上還戴着一朶朶的宮花，挨戶去唱小調。後面還跟個老丐，手裏拿着一面小銷羅，在門口嘡嘡地一陣敲着。於是娘兒們便嬌聲唱着：　　「梅花雪裏開，桃花等春來！　　灶王到，人家好　　灶王那裏來？灶玉天上來；　　灶王掉一掉，人家好一好！　　一份人家掉不到灶司菩薩要動惱　　賀新年　　北帮的乞丐，在新年初一到初十止，每到人家門口，不得像平時開口便喊「大爺大奶奶」，必須先念一套吉祥的歌曲。宣達「新春發財」之意。其詞如下　　「新年新月過新春，花紅對子貼滿門　　斗大的元寶抬進來。　　前門進的搖錢樹　　後門進的聚寶盆。　　聚寳盆，插金花。　　富貴榮華到一家。」　　念完了歌兒，接着才喊着：　　「大爺大奶奶，給你拜年啦！給個　吃罷」　　扮烏龜　　本帮乞丐在進期間常扮鳥龜ｈ　門乞討，以二人爲一小組，一長一幼，頭上各戴着稻草帽　，眼圈畫着眼鏡，　狀令人生　。合唱詞如下：　　「烏龜上街頭，生意閙稠稱。　　綫香鼻頭胡椒眼　　錐鎮尾巴橄欖頭。　　小烏龜，那哼呌：「吱吱吱」！　　大烏龜，那哼呌：「咖咖咖」！　　吱吱咖咖眞會吵　　讓我來討個銅鈿買藥料，　　藥殺烏龜勿來討。今昔不同  黃接青　　古時各國的元旦　　古時希臘的元旦，係在公歷六月；馬其頓的元旦在九月；羅馬帝國的元旦先在三月，後改在一月三日；墨西哥定二月十三日爲元旦；回敎人的元旦，却在七月間；　蘭，阿刺伯等國的元旦，却是十二月二十八日。掌故五十年前　目海人過陰歷年  錦霞　　五十年前，每逢年節，上海的士紳商賈，多用梅紅或洋紅的名片，面積較目前所用的卡片大兩倍，正面書寫姓名，反面印有字號，到親友處投片賀年。　　賀年時候，對於長輩，照例要行跪拜，向平輩，則行作揖。所以賀年的人，雇有跟班僕役，執了毡子隨行，跪拜前，跟班先舖毡在地。　　當時婦女出門拜年，已嫁的大都穿起紅裙披風；未嫁的，單着紅裙。　　那時候的春聯，除了商家嵌川店招名號以外，一般居戶，多沿用「皇恩浩蕩，帝道一遐昌。」「國恩家慶，人壽年豐。」等句。直到民國成立，帝制革除，方才改變。返老還童有良藥  溪譯　　科學家研究牡牛荷爾蒙的結果，證明睪丸素有减輕年齡至少十歲的功效。施用睪丸素的人，他的性活力和工作能力都能返弱爲强。醫生臨床經騐，證明睪丸素對於治療乳癌，產婦出血，狹心症和肌肉萎縮等症，都有顯著的功效。　　但是要獲得良好的結果，必須連續或大量施用睪丸素，而睪丸素不易多得，且每公分售美金一百元，非富有者是無力購買的　　現在，從墨西哥傳來了驚人的消息：人們正從「撒沙爾」根中大量提取睪丸素代價低廉，只及動物性睪丸素的十分之一。墨西哥和南美各地的藥房裏面，已有此種睪丸素藥片出售。發明者蘇爾摩博士，此公居住墨西哥二十年，曾聽得當地土人的迷信傳說，謂血紅的撒沙爾根有强身之功用。蘇氏對此迷信非特不加漠視，反而潛心研究，却不料得到意外的收穫。　　蘇爾摩以動物和人類作數千次的實騐以後，證明撒沙爾荷爾蒙具有和動物性荷爾蒙同樣的性能。他此刻正在研究自根撒沙爾提取荷爾蒙的更愛有效的方法。目前的提製法是先將細長的撒沙爾根剝去外皮，磨成粉末，再經化煉而成白色無臭結晶體，使與一種鹽性熔液化合，類似人體的分泌液，然後裝入供注射用的小玻管，或壓成藥片。　　很奇怪的，撒沙爾並不是一種「新藥」。早在十大世紀時代，歐洲醫生已用撒沙爾治療梅毒，皮膚恙，腺病和風濕病。即在今日，撒沙爾糖漿仍被用作內服藥的混合劑，因爲它能增加腸壁對於其他藥物的吸收力。　　撒沙爾生長於熱帶地方，而以墨西哥，中美洲及南美較熱地區產量最豐，大都野生，無須人工種植。蘇爾摩預料此植物性睪丸素將來大量生產以後，全世界各國的人民都可以享受這價廉物美的保持靑春藥劑，像現在服用維他命或阿斯匹靈一樣。　　年靑的新歌星凱塞琳葛蕾遜在「錦繡天堂」中。月球旅行非不可能英國工業家肯納狄最近設計一種用原子能發動的行星間飛船模型，陳列於倫敗模型展覽會中。此次理想一旦實現，則月球旅行可能於兩天至五天之時期內達到目的矣。圖示設計者肯氏及其模型。余毒未盡  若斯　　警務　在「嗎啡大王」舊宅中，一次搜到烟土一千零五十八斤，這個數目可不算小。據說依「市價」算，要値到卅三四億之譜，更是可觀。（息見十四日本報）　　據說「嗎啡大王」已在敵僞時期案發潛逃，可是是烟土還在，可稱「餘毒未盡」。　　而且烟土有「市價」，更是說明，根本有「毒」，不是「盡」或「未盡」的問題了。　　敵僞時期，烟土公賣公吸，毫無忌憚，烟土常然有「市似」，可是現在爲何有「市價」？（我想也許是記者的筆誤）如有「市價」當然是名符其實的「黑市」了。　　不過，不久以前，當局曾公佈過一個數字，說是陝川等幾省，目前「尙有」烟民六十萬人，道「尙有」兩個字就大有「餘毒未盡」的意思。我們如果來算一算，少算一點，十個烟民每天吸一兩烟土，六十萬人吸六萬兩，用廿兩稱算，每天就要吸三千斤，一個月要吸九百担，假使個個是「老槍」，算二千祖也不算多。　　那麼這個數目比之於「嗎啡大王」的「餘毒」，就毒得厲害得多！因爲一千餘斤還不够裝滿一卡車，兩千担可就儘够用火車裝了。　　「餘毒未盡」乎？毒猶猖獗乎？烟土還有「市價」，看是該作如何解釋？幕後人阿根廷總統夫人（上）  佐溪　　一位謎樣的少婦　　當約翰。貝隆（Juan　Peron）當選阿根廷總統時，一般的北美洲人都覺得驚奇不置。他們心目中認爲阿根廷在多年失却自由以後可以自由投票時，必然打倒獨裁政治無疑。至少在理論上阿根廷是推　世界法西斯主義的盟國。旣然是聯合國之一，一定不會投票贊成法西斯復活的。　　可是這些推想畢竟是一種熱望罷了。事實上，只隆的當選總統，只是技巧上的成功而已。在佔有決定性多數的阿根廷勞動階級選民的頭腦中，「貝隆」兩個字自然地引出一位豔麗動人的少婦的印象來。她——伊娃·貝隆——憑着她的美色和甘言蜜語，替她丈夫拉到了許多選舉票。　　權在總統之上　　今日最後人注意的人物不是阿根廷總統，而是他的夫人。伊娃貝隆據有阿根廷政治舞合的最高地位，她的一切活動的目標是比她丈夫所領導者更澈底的一種革命。曾　　過拉丁美洲歌劇皇后的阿根廷總統夫人伊娃貝隆，在错綜複雜的政治世界裏，堪稱獨一無二奇特人物了　　想從正式的訪問確認伊娃貝隆是阿根廷的眞正權威者，是很困難的。她在電話裏竭力裝做是貝陸的單純的妻子和賢內助的樣子，說話是那樣的閃鑠其詞。當記者問及妙關於她的政治活動的情形時，她回答說：「政治？不！不！我對於政治從來不曾感到過興趣。我一點也不了解政治是什麼東西。我完全不懂得政治！我所關心的工作祗有社會福利事業和救濟貧民的事情。」　　但是事實是這樣的：據芝加哥太陽報的記載，伊娃貝隆的主要工作是有組織的政治運動。她每天在阿根廷京城郵政總局大厦內她的總機關裏接見許多人物，討論到有關政府的事情。她此刻正在把阿根廷的婦女組織起來，準備賦與她們以選舉權。據消息靈通方面人士稱：此項權利一經賦與以後，現政府將在一九四八年大選中獲得鉅大的票數。　　根據貝隆夫人自己的話，她一天的工作忙碌於社會服務，她說：「我每天早晨七點鎮便起身，我參觀工廠，和工人們隨便談話。在吃中飯的時候，我把有關工人問題吿訴貝隆將軍。我所最關心的一件事便是怎樣改善窮人的生活狀况。」　　與政客們爲伍　　但是新聞記者已經注意到：聚集在貝隆夫人辦公處的會客室裏的工會代表和婦女團體領袖中間夾雜省長，市長，在野政客，甚至內閣部長，都急於向她報吿。他們同時又注意到：來訪的嘉賓都經過德阿混血種秘書恩斯特的甄別。　　伊娃貝隆和納粹的關係此較她的丈夫更密切，這可以從多方面來證明。貝隆夫人在私人談話中並不否認弗呂德父子是她的知己的同志。據調查報吿，美國務院的籃皮書稱弗氏是阿根廷的第一號納粹份子。他的兒子魯道爾夫曾隨同貝隆夫婦從事選舉動，支付一切費用，指導伊娃怎樣贏　　票選，在貝隆獲勝以後，弗呂德　勢力並沒有減退。當美國要求將大弗呂德逐出阿根廷國境時，貝隆却任侖他的兒子魯道爾夫爲他的「特別秘書」。（明日續完）春秋略談形式與內容  楊同芳　　關於藝衛品的形式與內容間題，近代美學家頗多創見。哥爾樣（Gourmont）說：「要想把形式與實質截然分開，實在是不可能的」、我們研究學術，所以要立名詞，不過爲了探討便利，即如藝術上的形式與內容便是不能載然分開的。我們的思想和情緒，瞬息萬變，絕對不易把握，但在某種情形下，也必須加以限制，使它凝成一體，成爲具體的東西，然後能傳達於人，因此就需要有一種形式。警如說文學作品，形式與內容必需配合起來，而後辭義會融，纖微必達，表現力才能臻於完善。所以爲求表現完善，便不能不講求形式。一般人所說的方法即指此。怎樣範字　辭，怎樣選材布局，怎樣在辭采聲調上用功夫，差不多都是每個成功的作家所必需審愼考慮的。　　溫奇斯特（widchester）認爲形式爲傳達情感思想方法的總和，就是說傳達情感思想必藉重形式，不過，我們要認淸形式只是手段，而非目的。藉形式把內容的實質充分地表現出來，才能完成一種完美的作品。於此我們可以看出形式與內容關係的密切。古今中外的文評家大概都有同樣的一種見解，那就是說要使形式完美，一定要先充實內容。溫奇斯特要作家注重內容的實質，否則就該不到形式。曾滌生求闕齋日記有云：「凡作詩文，有情極眞摯，不得不一傾吐之時，然亦須平時積理旣富，不假思索，左右逢源，其所言之理，足以達其胸中至眞至正之情，作文時無鐫字刻句之苦，文成後無鬱塞不吐之情，皆平日讀書積理之功也。」王充論文，亦重內容，它稱爲「文辭之本〕。他有有幾句話說得極好：「文辭舉說，文人之榮葉皮殼也。實誠在　臆，文墨作竹帛，內外表裏，自然相副，意奪而筆縱，故文見而實露」。這個譬喩很恰當。　　從各家的話看來，內容決定形式，形式表現內容。有形式而無實質，則形式徒爲空洞的具文，好像一個人有骨骼而無血肉，仍不成其爲人。有實質而無形式，好像有材料而無結構，仍不能成爲一種建築。所以內容是決定形式的唯一條件，但是在另一方而，形式也是文學作品臻於完善的一個主要因素，同樣一種實質，一種材料，一種內容，可以因表現技巧的優劣而分作品的好壞。辭采之於一篇文章，一如離琢之於金玉，紋彩之於布帛，藻飾華麗，光彩絢爛，可以顯示實質的瑰奇，增加讀者欣賞的興趣。　　我想任何人都有或多或少的情感和思想，可是表現力却非每個人都具備，或每個人都很優越的，所以要把心中所想的，如實地傳達出來實在不是一件容易的事。欲形式與內容兩得其美，兩相吻合，毫無缺憾，的確很難。因爲情感和思想是飄渺莫定變幻多端的，沒有定型，而文字的形義則爲習慣所拘。因此有不少作家感於中國語　的貧乏，要求創造新的活的語彙，使表現上能更加充分，意義上更加確切。　　文心雕　福思　說：「方其搦管，氣倍辭前。暨乎成篇，半折心始。何則？意翻空而易奇，文微實而難巧也。」作家能暸然於心者，未必能瞭然於手，所以每感意不稱物，文不達意之苦，我們一向所說的「眼高手低」，也含有這種意思。有些人儘管心中想不到，但　到到別人的作品，便會意有所觸，心有所動，這時已經悟到別人的思想，但他能枇判辨審人家的作品，可是自己却不一定寫得出。　　作家對於所要表現的思想，要能得心應手，文如其意，無論寫人物或記事說理能恰到好處，一定要精研寫作技巧，在表現方法上有一番深切的條養。一般地說，思想的傳達比感情爲容易，如果文學僅僅發表純粹的思想，那普通的語言，也可以勉强够用了，可是一涉及到情感方而的發抒，那就非借助完美的形式不可·通常記事析理的文章，所需要的修辭技巧，決不若抒情詩歌的繁難。在讀者也是如此，要想　到眞正的欣賞的目的，澈底抓住詩歌的眞意，也比較其他文辭要難得多。　　我們要想創作優良的文學作品，必須計究形式，但先決問題似乎還在內容的實質，因爲形式是附麗於實質上的。　稱立誠是我們寫作應有的信條。章學誠說：「言貴識，不尙飾」，的　　　　形式與內容對於構成一篇文學作品都同樣重要．我們不必爭辯形式決定實質，抑實質決定形式。一　好的作品應該是形式與實質相乘的積數，其交互影響作品的好壞是顯然的．所以除非思想情感語文發生凝合作用，成爲一個化合體，然後寫出來，決不能有完美的作品。朱光潔先生說：「思想是實體，語文是投影」，是最好的形式與內容解釋。詩談片  林風　　詩是我們最親熱的友伴，我們向它申訴，向它乞援，向它責問，向它呼喊……在最貧困的日子它也不離開我們，而它最優越的特質，是永遠無盡的賜給我們精神的慰安，從不在我們身上平分一點什麼，即便一單位的熱量，反之，有時它到會增加我們的體溫的。　　風景  Zingg〔法國近代名畫〕抑制  臧贊　　多年沒有看見下大雪了。這些日子都流落在異鄕，像遊蕩者一樣，像敲着木魚化綠的山僧一樣，到處是家，到處找尋溫情的佈施。可是郤始終是孤寂的。　　如今是回到家園來了，看着多年沒見的大雪：　　雪如蘆花似的飛舞，漲漫天空，一層層地舖滿大地，大地白得刺眼，白得寂寞。在寂寞滿蘊的時候，一羣歡樂的孩子從各個角落裏衝了出來，揚起一片充滿生命的呌嚷，立刻打起雪仗，堆起雪人來了。一年一度人們由於寒冷而引起的歡樂展開在白雪之上；雪上踏滿足跡——有人的也有狗的。　　雪不斷地下着，層積它的寒冷的白光。這白雪穿進我的胸腔，層積在我的心上，我總想溶解這些寒冷，可是終敵不過這不斷湧來的寒冷；我的心幾乎失去正常的躍動，如雪般慘白。這顆失去節奏的跳躍着的心，未始不想隨着孩子們的歡樂跳躍，可是總跳得那般蹌跟，如心臟病患者一樣，我的心受了頑固的創傷。　　我也有過童年。也有足够的然力與天眞在冰雪中任情地揮洒，任情地浪費，我不相信冷，我相信熱，我相信更多的冷能產生更多的熱。於是我帶着這熱誠與信心決然地啓程了，我將遊遍這冰雪的世界，如阿拉斯加的探礦者，追尋他們的希望。我的心白而發光，如礦工們的燈一樣，我將在高舉在頭頂，希冀看到同樣的證光。滿懷着希望，越過一個山谷又一個山谷，一個村落又一個村落……　　而原野是多麼荒涼啊！我隔着烏雲找尋星星，而摸觸到的只是沉寂，海一般的沉寂，聽不見一聲招乎，呌不出一個回聲。　　終於我又襤褸地，一無所獲的走回了故鄕，那十年來毫無所繫的心，懷着那最後的希冀，可是故鄕的田園是荒蕪了故鄕如他鄉一樣陌生，甚或令人更爲憎惡……我的希望幾乎變成絕望，我舉在頭頂的理想幾乎絕滅。　　一個冬天過去又是一個冬天，我毫無所獲，只學會了心中熱情的抑制——它已是浪費得太多了。綠色  葉風　　綠色是生命的象徵。　　植物吸取陽光製造綠色素予生命以永恒的延貫和發展，於是枝中茂盛，繁花怒放，大自然便襯托出一片濃蔭。　　綠色給予人們的感覺是親切的。　有綠色的地方，生命是跳躍而豐沛，茁壯而堅實的。　　當我們躺在春天底緣茵裏時，我們底心將感到如何的開朗，它常常會給我們帶來一個高遠的埋想和一個崇高的信念：　　生命是不息的工作和戰鬥！哀孤女篇  習喜　　北平北海有一個座落叫做攬翠軒，在所謂瓊島的最高處，循石級迤遷而登，忽見一掌平　，近俯皇城，重重黃瓦國映於綠樹之中，金　玉　橋有如一帶，軍馬往來，只如羣　，而看起來清晰可數，憑闌遙望西北諸山，日色照之，有陰陽顯晦之不同，遂斑較各呈異狀。想起來身在城中而能見三四十里以外，不可謂非奇觀，而況　登並不甚費力，又有籐椅淸茶之榮。這一次記得正當雪後，翠柏蒼松都灑上了白粉，遠山戴着殘雪，分外襯出蔚藍的天色，空氣是那樣的澄着，只聽見覓食的省聲，喚破了岑寂，我便悠然長懷人生萬物的拘束，在無情的歲月中是永永不放鬆的，冬天雖然是靜止的狀態，又安知正在蘊蔽艱難的掙扎的心情呢？　　隔壁的茶坐上有幾個外路口音的女學生也彷彿此唱彼和的對景物而興永歎。其中一個注目看了我幾回，忽然在我不留意的時候走過我這邊而很謙恭的向我說：「光生：年在××講習所演講的時候，還記得有我這個學生麼？」　　我愕然不能置答。　　她繼續委婉的吿訴我：她是北平東部某城的一個孤寒女子，好容易熬到大學畢業之後，滿想可以靠自己的能力尋個職業養她的老母了，誰知本鄕的事業是向來由木鄕一班先進把持着的，新出來的人總是說他們資格不彀，就是勉强礙着人情不好反對，總必將薪俸定得極低使人實在不能幹下去，，結果落得說，年輕人旣沒有資格，只知道要拿錢。他看透了這種伎倆，知道一個弱女子是不配與他們鬥法的了，所以忍氣吞驟作了點小事之後，想藉保送到這個「某某講習所」的機會，混個資格，在大城市裏比較還容易存身些。　　說到這裏，我便插嘴說：「記得你所學的那一門，出路也相當的窄，北平找事還容易麼？」　　她又吿訴我，所學的是什麼，與找事的難易是沒有什麼關繫的，反正找事要有人情，那有眞正是爲事擇人的呢？我的困難倒不在乎此，而在乎人家都嫌我外鄉的士氣太重，覺得我不是這帮口的人，所受的揶揄白眼，也就難以形容，我也知道天不會安排一個滿意的環環境我，所以極力容忍，也極力和同塵以免孤立，凡事遷就，圖個眼前淸凈；但是像我這樣微薄的收人而要重新全身打扮起來，以徇時俗的耳目，可憐我的老母就不免要多忍些飢寒了。言下凄然之色，令人不忍仰視，我只好竭力想幾句安慰的話，答應替她留意設法，在這黯淡的急景凋年，更增一番惆悵。　　過了些時，我在市塲閑步，突然又遇着她迎面走來，似乎很倉皇的說：「光生，可以借個地方容許我十分鐘的談話麼？」我一而點頭，一面同她步入一家小館。她坐定之後，劈頭一句話是：「我已經是無母之人了。」我說：「這無怪你傷心，但人生這段痛苦是不能逃避的，你有需要我帮助的地方麼？」她便嗚咽的吿訴我：「她們的先世本來是某城的一個世族，因爲家庭的不幸事故，她的母親只剩得三間破屋，帶着她姊妹兩人過了二十幾年孤苦伶仃的生活，不幸妹妹又在將要成人的時候死去，自從她讀書以至就事，在母親跟前的日子實在無幾，而母親盼望她成名立家以奉養其餘生則二十幾年如一日。到了晚年幻想愈切，而離事實愈遠，除掉假期帶一點可口的東西稍爲安慰安慰老母而外，竟沒有使她開眉歡笑的一天；一年之中母親盼女歸來，女兒則思母而又欲歸不得，人事的乘違，就這樣將有限的血肉之軀消磨盡了。人生的悲苦，竟是無有窮期，茫茫天地，各何處申訴呢？她想我母女一生的抑鬱，只有在羅前立一塊碑，盡情的傾吐出來，或者身世相同的博他們一掬同情淚。　　我說：「你不妨自己寫將出來，我可以替你斟酌　　過幾天果然寄來一篇文稿，所叙述的母女之愛，至性動人，情景副眞，我覺得竟不能易一字，就替她寫了，大概某城的公墓中至今有這哀哀欲絕的墓碑在。每逢天寒欲雪，我總想起她的凄淸的語調來。一寸山河一寸血152  葉勁風　　「恐急糾舉」，鶴見一聽有人這般吼着，便也如此答應。一面答應，早已發現近衛的矮床後面，有人站着，黑影裏看去，眞像「半座寳塔」。　　〔鶴見王，奉首腦命，恐急糾舉……」鶴見按着會裏方式，把來意說明出來。　　「盟友都在外塲」，那位「哼」的脚色說，「要盡職務的，從這窗口跳出去」！武士道發話，歷來就是這種吃了生米的口氣。　　那矮床後面不是有一座大屏風嗎？那屏風後面就有幾扇大窗戶，　見經他一　引，便奔到屏風後面；一看，那窗上的格扇都是合上的。拉開了裕扇，外面又是一層玻璃格子。這玻　格子一開，立刻就聽到可噹的刀聲，這間雜着　哈的交鬥吆喝。　　鶴見剛從窗口　下，於聽得砰的一聲，是一種極小型的手槍，發射的聲音，嗤的一饗，子彈却從自己頭上掠過。　　鶴見沒有留心這一下，所以也來不及俯身躱避。他心下明白，這只是一種「打招呼」的表示，因爲在這種塲面上出現的脚色，要就不帶手槍，如要帶槍，必是射無不中的高手，哪裏肯讓子彈從人家頭上掠過的道理！「打招呼」，同時也是警告；呌來人心下明白，是敵是友，赶快明白表示。不過有時却是自已，恐防來人沒有知道當塲的危險，預先射他一槍，關照一聲。　　鶴見一聽子彈飛過，立刻大聲吆喝「恐急糾舉」！表明自己的</p>

<h3>Four Principles for Resuming Peace Talks - Chairman Generally Agreed - Government May Send Personnel to Yan'an with Them</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet for government and Political Consultative Conference (PCC) representatives and Wu Dingchang, Da Wei, and others on the 15th evening at 7:00 PM, which concluded at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang summoned government officials to his residence tonight at 7:30 PM to study a plan for resuming peace talks. Those present included Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Chen Li-fu, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, and eleven others. The preliminary results of yesterday's talks between the government representatives at Sun Ke's residence were reported to the Chairman by Lei Zhen this morning. They continued to offer opinions on this plan tonight. The Chairman generally agreed with the four principles of the proposed plan for resuming peace talks drafted by the representatives and gave some instructions. It is also understood that the specific method of resuming peace talks has not been decided yet, but it is most likely that personnel will be sent to Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Shao Lizi stated on the 15th that the government's plan has not yet been finalized and its content cannot be announced at this time. If the Yan'an side agrees, it will be conveyed by those going to Yan'an. Government officials may meet again within days to discuss the plan. The government's views may be conveyed to the Communist Party through Ambassador Stuart. When a reporter asked who the government would send to Yan'an, the reply was, "It doesn't matter who goes." Another reporter asked whether a round table conference or direct negotiations would be held in the future. Shao said: "This matter depends on the opinions of the Yan'an side." He also stated that what the government values is the resumption of peace talks, and it does not adhere to any particular format. He hoped that the Communist Party would not think that the government is not sincere. He said that resuming peace talks is not because the government is in a bad situation and must resume peace talks. In fact, peace talks should be resumed for the sake of the country and the people, not because one side has this need. Whether peace talks can be resumed at present depends on whether the Communist Party's attitude can change. When a reporter asked about his views on Zhou Enlai's statement, Shao said that he had not yet seen the full text.</p>
<p>Government's Peace Talk Opinions to Be Conveyed to the Communist Side by the Ambassador</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang met with Ambassador Stuart after hosting a banquet for government and PCC representatives on the 15th evening.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Ambassador Stuart met with Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 15th. It is heard that the government's opinions may be conveyed to the Communist side through the Ambassador.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Ambassador Stuart, accompanied by Fu Jingbo, visited Zhang Qun at 10:00 AM on the 15th. At noon, the Ambassador invited Wang Bingnan to lunch.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] A well-informed person from a third party told reporters: Peace talks are indeed a difficult task, but the current government plan may be considered by the CCP. Furthermore, the CCP's troop movements in Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, and various propaganda boasting of military strength, are aimed at peace rather than war. The idea is that "those who can fight can make peace," and the intention is to create bargaining chips for negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] People close to the CCP criticized the four points of the government's proposed peace talk plan reported in the newspaper, saying: "If the content of the plan is indeed as reported in the newspaper, then negotiations will 'run aground immediately after contact.' The government's proposed 'ceasefire in place' is equivalent to asking the CCP to recognize the CCP areas led by the National Army since January 13th of last year. Therefore, if the January ceasefire agreement is not implemented, the ceasefire issue and long-term peace cannot be resolved. Regarding the points of military reorganization, transportation, and local government, the military reorganization plan is one of the three agreements signed in January of last year, the restoration of transportation is one item in the June four-point agreement, and local government is part of the PCC. Therefore, what the CCP hopes for is the implementation of the entire agreement, and it cannot unilaterally put forward beneficial parts as conditions."</p>
<h3>The United States Will Adopt an Indirect Approach to Mediate the Conflict Between the Kuomintang and the Communists - The Ambassador Is Maintaining Contact with All Parties</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 15th] Political observers here predict that the United States will resume mediation of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists, but will adopt an indirect approach. They said: Marshall's past efforts did not take this approach. The fact that Ambassador Stuart still maintains contact with the CCP delegation in Nanjing is of great significance. It is heard that Zhang Qun told the Ambassador about the situation of the talks with representatives of minority parties in Shanghai and the government's determination to resolve the current stalemate, and assured the Ambassador that the United States' mediation still has an important task in future negotiations. Another government official, who is specifically drafting suggestions to be sent to the CCP, recently told our reporter: Marshall's departure from China and return to his country does not mean that the United States has stopped mediation. In fact, the opposite is true, and it will engage in mediation in a more informal and effective way. Therefore, the Ambassador may soon seek to promote the resumption of peace talks and reorganize the Chinese government, as Marshall requested in his statement on China.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Zhou Enlai delivered a speech in Yan'an on the anniversary of the PCC, commenting on Marshall's statement. Zhou's speech was over 3,000 words long and only detailed the government's alleged destruction of the PCC resolutions and ceasefire agreement. He did not put forward new opinions on the current situation.</p>
<h3>Criticism from the Social Democratic Party</h3>
<p>It's Best Not to Dwell on Past Grievances</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Sun Baoyi, a spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, said: The Social Democratic Party will consider issuing a declaration within a day or two, taking a stand on the people's perspective and stating the party's attitude towards reopening peace talks. Regarding Zhou Enlai's speech, Sun believes that the shortcomings Zhou pointed out, such as restrictions on people's freedom, lack of provincial constitutions, and failure to adopt a cabinet system, can all be corrected in the future in the constitution, but it cannot be denied that the National Assembly tore up the constitution. The government's convening of the National Assembly and passing the constitution is also not "illegal." The current problem is fundamentally not a legal issue. It is best not to dwell on past grievances and sincerely seek reconciliation. From the perspective of the party's interests, there can be various strategies, but from the perspective of the people, only peace can survive. Regarding garrisoned areas, after the implementation of the military reorganization plan, all troops belong to the state and there is no distinction between them. As far as local government is concerned, unification will inevitably form after democracy is realized. In democratic countries, the power of the central and local governments is often held by two parties. Therefore, if both parties are sincere, there are no difficulties that cannot be resolved. On the contrary, if someone disregards the suffering of the people and deliberately causes the failure of peace talks, the people of the whole country should know where the responsibility lies.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the Kuomintang Peiping Municipal Representative Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 15th] The first representative assembly of the Kuomintang in Peiping opened at 9:00 AM this morning.

<h3>Stevenson Meets with Zhang Fakui to Discuss Relations Between Guangdong, Hong Kong, China, and the UK</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] British Ambassador Stevenson held talks with Director Zhang Fakui and Chairman Luo Zhuoying of Guangdong Province this morning regarding relations between Guangdong, Hong Kong, China, and the UK. He held a press conference at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to answer reporters' questions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The London Times published a lengthy article by its special correspondent today, urging the British government to determine a policy for the long-term relationship between Hong Kong and China, and suggesting the development of a five- or ten-year plan for Hong Kong's socio-economic development. The article pointed out that Britain has made many efforts in Hong Kong's public works, but has made little effort to alleviate the extreme poverty of a large number of Chinese residents.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department to Be Dissolved Next Month - Jiang Wen Staff Already Decided to Be Recalled</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Authoritative sources told reporters today that the Peiping Military Mediation Department will be dissolved in the second week of next month. The US authorities stationed in Peiping have decided to recall the US staff of the Military Mediation Department in the three weeks thereafter. The peace mechanism established by Marshall after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party signed a ceasefire agreement on January 10, 1946, will "collapse" once the Kuomintang and Communist representatives are recalled. This move is probably a sign that the United States' task of mediating China's internal strife will come to an end. However, Ambassador Stuart will continue to work for peace during his tenure.</p>
<p>It is understood that the CCP Liaison Office here is anxiously awaiting the US policy on the Military Mediation Department. CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan has repeatedly inquired about the news that the Military Mediation Department will be dissolved at the US Embassy.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Linzao and Taizao Fronts - Xuzhou Becomes the Focus of Offense and Defense - Communist Army in Jiaodong Launches a Supporting Offensive</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 15th] The focus of the war in Southern Shandong has now shifted to the battle for the defense of the Zaozhuang coal mines. In recent days, almost all of the main forces of the Communist army along the Taizao branch line have moved north and concentrated their forces to launch a desperate attack on Zaozhuang. The defending troops are full of vigor and calmly resisting. The Communist army has repeatedly attacked and failed, suffering heavy losses. At this moment, the Communist army's offensive is showing signs of exhaustion. A powerful corps of the National Army has now arrived near Zaozhuang. The siege of Zaozhuang can be lifted within days. The National Army in Southern Shandong is currently in a completely advantageous position, and the situation will improve in a matter of time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] Because the Communist army in Southern Shandong failed to attack Heerzhuang, it is now concentrating all its forces to besiege Zaozhuang. The Communist army attempts to capture Zaozhuang, reoccupy Lincheng, and echo the Communist army in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. It is heard that a small number of Communist troops sneaked into the Linzao branch line yesterday, attempting to cut off the National Army's retreat in Zaozhuang, but were repelled.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] Xuzhou, historically known as a strategic location for military strategists, has now become the battlefield for both the National Army and the Communist Army to defend and attack. The Communist Army is currently attacking Lincheng on the northeast of Xuzhou, the Taizao branch line, Jinxiang on the northwest, and Yongcheng on the southwest, apparently wanting to remove the surrounding satellite cities of Xuzhou, creating the isolation of Xuzhou. The Communist Army takes advantage of its numerical superiority and adopts a piecemeal policy of defeating the National Army one by one. The National Army strictly abides by the order to stop conflicts and has many concerns, resulting in some military losses, which cannot be denied. However, the National Army's tolerance is also limited. The immovable defense made in Zaozhuang, Jinxiang, and Yongcheng is a powerful hint to the greedy Communist Army, urging them to realize and withdraw, and the country's affairs are awaiting political consultation to resolve.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] (1) The Communist Army's siege of Zaozhuang, which numbered 100,000 troops, has not slackened as of the 15th. The National Army is firmly defending. (2) The Communist Army Zhang Taisheng's unit, which had sneaked into the area between Yongcheng and Boxian, launched a siege of Yongcheng County on the morning of the 15th. The National Army is fighting hard to meet the attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 15th] In order to support the Southern Shandong campaign, the Communist Army in Jiaodong launched a new offensive on the Jiaoji Railway. Parts of the 4th and 9th Divisions, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th New Regiments, the Laiwu Zidibing Corps, and the main force of the 1st Brigade, totaling more than 20,000 people, gathered in the area south of Boshan and Mingshui, attempting to move north. The Jiao Nan Column's 2nd Independent Brigade, the Binhai 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Independent Regiments, and the Binbei Military Sub-district teams, totaling about 15,000 people, sneaked into Zhucheng, claiming to attack Gaomi. The 5th Division sneaked into Pozi (25 kilometers north of Weibei) Xihai, and the 1st and 2nd Independent Regiments sneaked into Qingbu (15 kilometers southeast of Changyi), intending to attack Changyi and Wei. Another 11th Division invaded the vicinity of Suozhen, with signs of moving south to attack Changshan, Zouping, and Zhangdian.</p>
<h3>National Army in Northern Jiangsu Recovers Yinping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] It is learned that: (1) Liu Bocheng's troops in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway have currently concentrated their main forces of more than five divisions, including a regiment of Japanese prisoner gunners and machine gunners, to cooperate in the battle. The fierce fighting in Miaotou Yinping in Northern Shubei has lasted for two days and nights. This morning at 6:00 AM, a certain regiment of the National Army began a counterattack and completely defeated the Communist Army, recovering Yinping at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] Although Guan Yun has been recovered, the remnants of the Communist army are still harassing the area, killing and looting without doing anything. Villages within 60 li south of the Zhongzheng Square and north of Yangjiaji have been completely burned down, corpses are lying all over the place, and even chickens and dogs are rare.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] The remaining communist forces in Northern Jiangsu, in Mu, Guan, and Yu, have indeed moved north and broke through. After three days and nights of fierce fighting on the Feizao River and Wan Wan line, the Communist Army has become hostile because of heavy casualties. The Communist Army on this line seems to be expecting reinforcements from Southern Shandong and is stepping up harassment.</p>

<h3>Qing Yun Troupe's Work Effective: Cargo Transport on the Beining Railway Greatly Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Dispatch, 15th] The Qing Yun (Clearance and Transport) Troupe organized by the Pingjin Railway Bureau has achieved great success in its work. Cargo transport volume between Ping and Yu on the Beining Railway has increased from 2,500 tons per day to 8,000 tons. The detention of railcars and delays in loading and unloading have become rare. In addition, 10,000 tons of Kailuan coal are transported daily (the mine currently produces 12,000 tons per day), and 2,500 tons of Mentougou coal are transported, along with military transport. There are 2,400 vehicles regularly transported between Ping and Yu. On the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway (between Ping and Zhang), traffic has reached Qinglongqiao, with seven trains running in each direction daily, including three passenger trains, one train for coal and road materials, and three trains for cargo and military transport. Due to the outflow of grain and hides controlled by the Chahar province, empty cars often return to Ping. The transport capacity on the central section (between Zhangjiakou and Datong) is even smaller, with only three trains running in each direction daily, taking two days for the entire trip. The Railway Bureau plans to request funds from the Ministry of Communications to resume construction of the unfinished Shatang section, which was started by the Japanese, running from Shacheng to Tanggu without passing through Qinglongqiao.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Representatives in Vietnam Host Journalists, Requesting the Government to Protect Overseas Chinese Urgently, or Take Immediate Measures to Relieve the People from Suffering</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Yan Renyi and Yang Wenzhong, representatives of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, hosted a tea party for the local press at Xinghualou Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. First, Representative Yang reported: “We, representing overseas Chinese, returned to China to report the tragic situation of overseas Chinese in various parts of northern Vietnam and to urge the government to find ways to protect overseas Chinese. We departed from Hanoi before the Lunar New Year, on December 17. At that time, the Battle of Haiphong had ended, but the suburbs were still at war. Conflict started in Hanoi on that very day. Since arriving in the capital, we have repeatedly appealed to the relevant authorities to take effective measures to protect overseas Chinese. The authorities have also expressed deep concern, but it has been over twenty days since we arrived in the capital, and we have not yet obtained concrete solutions, so we have not been able to return to Vietnam to reassure our hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese. The war in Hanoi is still continuing. The overseas Chinese area is occupied by Vietnamese troops, surrounded by French troops, and cut off from the outside world. Food is scarce, garbage is piled up, and hunger, cold, disaster, and disease are unavoidable. It has been a month since the siege began. The miserable situation is self-evident. We now hope that our authorities will do the following: (1) The government has expressed deep concern about the tragic situation of overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam and is studying various ways to protect overseas Chinese. However, the government has many affairs to attend to, and this is just one of them, so it has not been able to quickly decide everything. On the overseas Chinese side, saving lives is like putting out a fire and cannot be delayed. Otherwise, if the overseas Chinese are injured or killed, then compensation and relief will not bring the dead back to life. Therefore, we hope that our government will quickly implement its determination to protect overseas Chinese and handle it with emergency methods, instead of following routine procedures, to relieve the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese from suffering. (2) What overseas Chinese are requesting is (1) relief, (2) sending senior officials to appease and investigate losses, (3) ordering the French and Vietnamese sides to compensate for losses, (4) requesting the Vietnamese side to release arrested overseas Chinese and release overseas Chinese who are blocked in various places along the way, so that they can return to the cities, (5) allocating planes to transport rice and medicine to assist the trapped overseas Chinese, and using the same planes to transport women and children back to the country.”</p>

<h3>Hundreds of Overseas Chinese Obtain Vietnamese Approval to Evacuate the Hanoi Overseas Chinese District, Executive Yuan Decides to Allocate 400 Million for Relief</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 15th] Hundreds of overseas Chinese have obtained the approval of the Vietnamese government to leave the Hanoi Overseas Chinese District. Some overseas Chinese in the area hope to evacuate to the neutral area prepared by the Vietnamese government outside Hanoi. Our Consul General in Hanoi will assist in this evacuation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Executive Yuan has decided to allocate 200,000 Vietnamese currency (equivalent to 400 million national currency) to relieve overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam. Relevant departments will organize an investigation team to go to northern Vietnam to investigate the damage suffered by hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in the French-Vietnamese conflict.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 13th] For nearly a month, communication between here and the motherland has been completely cut off. Our military post office, telegraph office, and China National Aviation Corporation have all suspended operations. Overseas Chinese are unable to obtain news from the motherland and hope that China National Aviation Corporation will resume flights immediately so that transportation to Hanoi can be fully restored.</p>

<h3>A Communist Army Commander Who Surrendered Reports the Inside Story of the Jidong "Liberated Area": Resources Are Scarce, Strong Men Flee, People's Wealth Is Depleted, Three-Fifths of the Soldiers Lack Clothing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] Zhao Zhuoran, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Communist 14th Brigade, Wen Zhenhua, Section Chief, and Fu Shanting, Commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 33rd Regiment, recently surrendered to the National Army in Jidong. They also hosted journalists the other day to report the inside story of the Jidong "Liberated Area." A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Government Aspect: The main political tasks of the Communist army at present are: (1) mobilizing young people to join the war, (2) launching liquidation movements, and (3) blockading materials, resulting in a shortage of materials in various counties in the Jidong "Liberated Area," and the number of strong men who flee and are killed is numerous. The Communist army's method of blockading materials is "districts do not leave districts, counties do not leave counties." All goods must be traded locally, causing materials to flow into the hands of the Communist army. In the liquidation movement, poor people are given materials or land, which are called "fruits of victory." Especially villagers who are idle year-round suddenly get "fruits" and are unbridled in their evil deeds. Poor farmers think that if they sit and eat "fruits," there is no need to farm, resulting in the abandonment of fields in various counties, and weeds grow. The Communist army is thus able to carry out its plan to destroy the economy.</p>
<p>(B) Economic Aspect: The Jidong "Liberated Area" issues border currency, with Zunhua as the center. It is stipulated that one national currency yuan can be exchanged for 1.8 border currency yuan. Villagers know that the border currency's fate is not long and painfully exchange goods for goods: three *sheng* of corn for two *chi* of cloth, one *jin* of white flour for half a *jin* of corn. Senior Communist officers use their power to set up production cooperatives in units above the brigade level to squeeze the people's wealth. For example, when cloth enters the "district," a tax of 30,000 is levied per bolt, regardless of its value. Units above the army level set up trade bureaus and openly sell drugs.</p>
<p>(C) Military Aspect: The main force of the Jidong Communist army consists of three brigades, numbered 10, 11, and 12, with eight regiments and one garrison regiment, plus one independent regiment, one artillery regiment, totaling 10,000 men and 100,000 militiamen. Most of them are new soldiers. There is deep suspicion among new officers and soldiers. Their lower-ranking soldiers have not received undershirts for three years. In each battalion, three-fifths lack clothing. They are mainly fed with corn, and the vegetable is called "Pacific," meaning vegetable leaves floating in white water. Recently, war-weariness has been increasing. In the recent Battle of Tuozitou, as many as 36 soldiers in one company of the Communist army abandoned their guns and fled. The 3rd Battalion of the 31st Regiment is left with only one platoon leader.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Municipal Council Requests Guangzhou to Be Changed to a Municipality Under the Direct Jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] At its first meeting this morning, the Municipal Council passed a motion proposed by Councilor Yuan Lianghan to "urge the Central Government to quickly change Guangzhou into a municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan." The motion listed that Guangzhou's population has exceeded one million, and it is important in terms of economy, culture, and politics. According to the provisions of the Autonomy Law, it should be changed into a municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Moreover, Guangzhou is the birthplace of the revolution, so Sun Yat-sen designated Guangzhou as a special city. Now, Jing, Ping, and Tianjin are all municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and Guangzhou has sufficient conditions and is no less than the above cities.</p>
<h3>Five Principles Set for the Central Work of the Relief Administration, Work Relief Conference Continues to Be Held</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting</h3>
<p>The meeting of the deputy foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union commenced in London on the 14th, with British Foreign Secretary Bevin personally presiding and delivering a welcoming address, expressing the hope that a situation allowing Germany to rise again would not be created. Starting from the 15th, discussions began on draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria, and an agenda will be agreed upon for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. Therefore, this Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting can be regarded as a prelude to peace talks with Germany and Austria. Based on past experience, whenever the four foreign ministers encountered disagreements, they would submit the issues to the deputy foreign ministers' meeting for resolution, often achieving unanimous agreement. The German and Austrian questions, especially the German peace treaty, were not resolved by the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, nor could an agreement be reached at the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Now, they are submitted to the London Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting for handling. Standing at the beginning of 1947, we cannot help but express our earnest expectations for this international conference.</p>
<p>The outbreak of World War I, Japanese militarists and Nazi Germany were the main culprits; logically, after the victorious end of the war, the United Nations should have first dealt with Germany and Japan. However, eighteen months have passed since the end of the war, and peace talks with Japan and Germany have not yet begun, which can only be described as a rare phenomenon in modern diplomatic history. The reason for this is that the opinions of the major victorious powers, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, have not converged. At the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the German question, which should have been resolved first, could have been resolved, but the resignation of British Prime Minister Churchill and the sudden death of US President Roosevelt led to the replacement of two of the world's three giants. Attlee and Truman both emerged as new figures on the international stage, and there was inevitably a sense of distance between them and Stalin. From then on, the German question was shelved.</p>
<p>Until Japan surrendered and World War II came to a complete end, the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union met in London, and everyone felt that it was necessary to proceed with peace talks with Germany. Unfortunately, during the London Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the views of the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union on the German question were completely different, like going south while wanting to go north, and no agreement could be reached. Therefore, the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference broke up in disagreement. Later, the three foreign ministers reached a compromise in principle at the Moscow Conference, but the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to expand on the basis of the compromise reached at the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and could only avoid the important and focus on the trivial, passing draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland and deciding to convene the Paris Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference. This resulted in peace with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland being achieved before peace with Germany. Although we cannot help but feel that this is putting the cart before the horse, it is also a kind of expedient measure in diplomacy.</p>
<p>The main task of the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference was to discuss the German question, but the drastic changes in the domestic political situation in France prevented Foreign Minister Bidault from leaving the country. At the same time, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs insisted that the Foreign Ministers' Conference could not proceed with the discussion of the German question unless French Foreign Minister Bidault personally participated. Therefore, the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference only decided on six agenda items for the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the peace treaties with Germany and Austria. The main points are as follows: (1) Discuss the report submitted by the Allied Control Council for Germany; (2) Determine the form and scope of Germany's temporary political organization; (3) Draft the peace treaty with Germany; (4) Discuss the draft of the Forty-Year Treaty for the Disarmament of Germany drafted by the United States; (5) Review the report on German coal production and distribution; (6) Draft the peace treaty with Austria. Although we cannot express complete satisfaction with the results achieved by the Foreign Ministers' Conference in handling the German question for more than a year, we are still hopeful in our hearts, seeing the German question moving step by step towards a resolution.</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly pointed out the impact of last year's New York Foreign Ministers' Conference: on the one hand, it brought a peaceful conclusion to international politics in 1946; on the other hand, it unfolded a beautiful vision for international politics in 1947. Therefore, we are particularly concerned about this year's first international conference and sincerely wish it success. However, reviewing the past, the reason why the German question has been difficult to resolve is due to conflicts of interest and differences of opinion among the countries. The foreign ministers of each country either insisted on their own opinions or only sought their own interests, unwilling to concede even a small step, making it difficult to reach a compromise. Observing the attitudes of the representatives of each country in the deputy foreign ministers' meeting, it is not difficult to see that the views of the representatives of each country remain the same, still taking the interests of their respective countries as the starting point. Therefore, we cannot help but worry here that if the representatives of the four countries do not change their attitudes and remain fixated on their own interests without considering the overall situation, then this Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting will still be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Although we are not unrealistic idealists, we still feel that if this Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in March are to complete their established tasks, then the diplomatic authorities of the four countries should base their attitudes towards Germany and Austria on reason and justice to seek a thorough resolution of the German and Austrian questions. The nature of the issues between Germany and Austria is completely different and cannot be generalized. They should be handled separately. For example, Germany should be severely punished, and it is reasonable to demand compensation for wartime losses. However, international diplomats should have foresight and attach particular importance to the re-education of the German people to eliminate the Nazi anesthesia and residual poison suffered by the German people, so that they can become a peace-loving country in the international community and no longer threaten European peace and security. At the same time, Germany's war industry must not be allowed to exist and should be stripped clean, not allowing any future troubles to remain, so that Germany's aggressive forces can rise again in ten or twenty years. Prevention is better than cure, and we must be particularly careful and vigilant at all times, and never create a situation that would allow Germany to rise again.</p>
<p>As for Austria, she was a victim of Hitler's aggression. The four countries should all bear the obligation to help Austria achieve independence. Not only should they verbally allow its independence, but they should also provide economic assistance in practice, making it a stable force in Central Europe, serving as a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe on the one hand, and as the backbone of economic cooperation among the countries of the Danube River on the other. Central Europe is the heart of Europe, and Austria's autonomy and independence are crucial to the safety of Europe. The lessons of history are most worthy of reflection by international political diplomats.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the future of the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting in handling the German and Austrian questions, although it is full of light and hope, we also see reefs and cold currents all around the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting.</p>
<p>The first is the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States. After the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference and the Second General Assembly of the United Nations successively closed, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States has improved, especially the Soviet Union's attitude towards the international community has changed significantly, from tough to moderate. On the part of the United Kingdom and the United States, there is also sincerity in respecting the Soviet Union's sense of security. In particular, the United Kingdom, fearing that the Soviet Union might lightly believe the rumors of a military alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States, sent Chief of the Army Staff Montgomery to visit the Soviet Union, which will greatly benefit the improvement of British-Soviet relations. However, judging from the future trends of US domestic and foreign policy, the improvement of US-Soviet relations under the control of the Republican Party cannot be viewed with optimism too early.</p>
<p>The second is the relationship between France and the Soviet Union. Post-war French politics has made significant progress and has indeed embarked on the path of peace and democracy, which the Soviet Union is happy to approach. Therefore, the relationship between France and the Soviet Union has been very friendly and close after the war, and even French diplomats, although standing in the position of a third-party mediator in previous international conferences, inevitably favored the Soviet Union. The success of post-war French diplomacy also relied on this subtle relationship. Taking the German question as an example, the opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States are generally the same; the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany has long been implemented, and although they have tried every means to induce France to participate, they have not yet succeeded. From this, it can be seen that the views of France and the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States are very different, and are more similar to the views of the Soviet Union, which is also a well-known fact. For the sake of the future of Europe, and also for its own interests, it is very necessary for the United Kingdom to seek consensus with France. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, French Minister of Transport Moch made a trip to London. In recent days, French Prime Minister Blum also went to London to visit and exchange views on the German question with Prime Minister Attlee. From the perspective of the Soviet Union, an observer, a "sour" effect cannot but occur. The sudden return of Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov to his country to report on his work is indeed worthy of our attention. Therefore, France's triangular relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States is also a cold current that may affect the deputy foreign ministers' meeting.</p>
<p>The third is that the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, and other eighteen countries have successively submitted memoranda. Standing on the side of justice, the opinions of these small countries should be respected, because the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, strictly speaking, cannot be considered true European countries, while these small countries are the true European countries; but how to reconcile the mutually contradictory opinions of each country? This makes the work of the deputy foreign ministers' meeting even more difficult.</p>
<p>In short, the holding of the London Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting is a prelude to the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and its success or failure will have a great impact on the development of international politics this year, and is also closely related to the Far East, enough to determine the timing of the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan. Therefore, we sincerely wish the London Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow in March a successful conclusion.</p>

<h3>Situation in Northern Jiangsu Gradually Clearing Up, Communist Troops Attempting to Flee to Southern Jiangsu, Wuxi Garrison Command Strictly Preventing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 15th] The Communist troops in the Northern Jiangsu region have now been progressively cleared, and all Communist troops have been divided into smaller units and are attempting to flee to Southern Jiangsu. It is learned that the Wuxi Garrison Command of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, in order to strictly prevent this, yesterday specially ordered the county governments of each county to complete a household registration check and report within five days. If any village or town headman conceals bandits or firearms without reporting them, they will be executed on the spot upon discovery.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 15th] It is reported that the provincial government, in view of the fact that everything in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu is waiting to be rebuilt, reduced minor taxes last year to reduce the burden on the people in the recovered areas, resulting in extremely strained county finances. It plans to gradually establish tax collection offices in various counties in Northern Jiangsu after the Spring Festival to levy various autonomous taxes, so as to enrich county governance expenses and eliminate the practice of disguised apportionment.</p>
<h3>Yong Security Police Stationed in Suzhou Moved to Mudu, Suppressing Lake Bandits' Unrest</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Suzhou] At the beginning of the restoration of the Suzhou Provincial Water Police organization, it was based on the pre-war water police organization, divided into five districts, and then reorganized into a general team, responsible for preventing and suppressing bandits and maintaining water security. However, water police administration was still lacking. Recently, in order to adapt to actual needs, the Suzhou Provincial Government reorganized each general team into a bureau, which would control the water police, equip them with warships, and be responsible for the security of rivers, lakes, and coasts. Zhang Shaohua, the head of the Second Water Police General Team stationed in Suzhou, has now received a reorganization order and has been transferred to the position of Director of the Taihu Lake Water Police Bureau. The teams under his command have been reorganized into water security police teams and moved to Mudu to deploy at various key points, in order to suppress the unrest of lake bandits.</p>
<h3>Wu Yu Li Shipping Steamer Encountered Robbery</h3>
<p>Police Chief Fought Bandits</p>
<p>Suffered Serious Injuries and Died</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Wuxing] The No. 2 steamer of the Lihang Shipping Bureau in this city departed from Hu to Meixi Town at 7:00 a.m. on the 10th with 41 passengers. When passing through Tangkou, there were three people dressed in military uniforms who had been lying in ambush in the boat, speaking with a northern accent. Two of them each took out wooden guns and fired several shots outward, ordering the boat to stop. At this time, Shen Mingshi, the police chief of Anqing County, and Inspector Lu Zhongxin, who were on board, saw the situation and knew that they were bandits. They immediately returned fire with the automatic and manual weapons they were carrying, hitting one bandit, who bled profusely. Then another bandit disregarded everything and pounced on Inspector Lu, eventually seizing one of the automatic and manual weapons. After obtaining the gun, the bandit swept the gun at Shen and Lu, causing serious injuries to Shen and Lu, as well as Wang Shixian, passengers Wang Yongcai, Li Dexing, Xu Li's, and Hu Xiuzhen, all of whom were covered in blood. Order was completely disrupted, and cries shook the sky. After obtaining the gun, the bandits disembarked and left. When the boat arrived in Hucheng, the injured were sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. Chief Shen died the next day due to his serious injuries.</p>
<h3>Anti-Bandit Campaign East of Songyin Town, Jinshan</h3>
<p>Security Team Soldier Zhou Weilin Killed in Action</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Jinshan] At about 1:00 p.m. on the 12th, Zheng Hansan, the captain of the 3rd Security Company stationed in Songyin Town of this county, believed that the security of the surrounding four villages was not peaceful and ordered four soldiers to go on patrol. When they reached the vicinity of Nanxun Dam east of the town, they discovered five or six people who looked flustered and whose movements were suspicious, hurrying eastward. The soldiers shouted at them to stop, but the bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately drew their guns and fired. The soldiers also returned fire, and a fierce battle broke out. Soldier Zhou Weilin disregarded his own safety and rushed forward, only to be shot and killed by the bandits. The bandits retreated northward. After receiving the report, the company captain immediately led soldiers, self-defense forces, and police to encircle and suppress them, and urgently telegraphed the brigade headquarters for reinforcements. Brigade Commander Li immediately led a team to search for them, but the bandits had already fled far away. They arrested one suspect and took him back for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin County Government Investigates</h3>
<p>Taking Bribes to Release Drug Offenders</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Jiangyin] Gao Sheng, the head of the Three Principles of the People Youth League in Zhouzhuang District, learned on the 4th of this month that a traveler named Wang Shoupeng (also known as Ren Zhi) was smoking opium in the Yanling Hotel in Zhouzhuang Town. He immediately ordered the team members Wu Jian'en, Wu Longcai, and Xing Zheng to investigate and seize six fen of opium. They claimed that they would take the team to the district combat office, but Wang Shoupeng, fearing the law, later asked a resident, Zhao Erji, to intercede and released Wang for 450,000 yuan in legal tender. The money was all received by Gao Sheng, who proposed to give 150,000 yuan as a bonus to the team members. The county government has now received a report that youth league members have committed this illegal act and will send personnel to investigate and severely punish them according to the law.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Big Traitor You Liumen</h3>

<p>[Report from this newspaper in Fuzhou] The case of Fuzhou's top traitor You Liumen has been publicly tried by the Fujian High Court and sentenced at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th. The main text of the judgment was: "You Liumen colluded with the enemy and plotted to resist his own country, and is sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for life, and his property confiscated except for a reasonable amount to be left for the living expenses of his family." When the traitor heard the verdict, his attitude was still stubborn and he expressed his dissatisfaction and appeal. The people of Fuzhou hated the traitor's actions as a henchman for the enemy, oppressing the people. Now, hearing the verdict, the people's hearts are greatly relieved.</p>
<h3>Seven Banks in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Organize a Syndicate</p>
<p>Loans to Rescue Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Totaling 1.05 Billion</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Fuzhou] Regarding the small-scale industrial and commercial loans held by the Central Bank in this city to save the current industrial and commercial crisis, the matter has now become concrete. The total amount is 1.05 billion yuan, which is organized by seven banks, including the China Industrial Bank, the Provincial Bank, and the Jiyou Bank, in a joint guarantee manner. Each bank will underwrite 150 million yuan. At present, the central problem is how to determine the standards for collateral and what conditions must be met in order to qualify for the loan. According to the central government's regulations, the collateral for industrial and commercial loans should be limited to the export goods of local products, but in this province, there are no products other than special products for export. This issue is being actively investigated and discussed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce with the responsible authorities. In addition, the monthly interest rate for this loan is set at 5%, with a limit of three months.</p>

<h3>At a Time When Hao County's City Defense Was Precarious, National Army Arrived to Assist, People Welcomed Them Madly</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Hao County] The Communist troops captured Guoyang on the 8th and approached Dasi Town in this county. For a time, the city defense was empty. The city gates were tightly closed during the day, restricting entry, and at night, lights were hung on every household, and patrols were constant. In addition, watchtowers were built, hoping to hold the city walls firmly and fight the Communist troops to the death. Because of this, the people in the city were living in terror, tossed by the wind and rain. Suddenly, at 11:00 a.m. on the 11th, the alarm bell rang loudly, implementing an emergency curfew. The four city gates were closed at that time, and sentries were densely deployed in the streets and alleys, cutting off pedestrians, as if facing a formidable enemy. It was not until about 12:00 p.m. that it was learned that the National Army's 58th Division 30th Regiment had come from Piqiao in Yongcheng to assist. Due to a misunderstanding in the telegraph transmission, the people were slightly alarmed, but seeing the National Army passing through the streets, their military appearance neat and their heroism invigorating, they all automatically hung flags and set off firecrackers to welcome them, and sent cigarettes to comfort them, their emotions were enthusiastically crazy.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Industrial and Commercial Loan</h3>
<p>Negotiations Have Not Yet Yielded Results</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Songjiang] In order to save the industrial and commercial crisis, the county government followed the provincial order to form a banking group and applied to the Shanghai Four Joint Office for a commercial loan of 5 million yuan to solve the urgent need. The county government and the county chamber of commerce sent personnel to Shanghai, and it was decided that the county bank, the Dianye Bank, and the Songjiang branch of the Farmers' Bank would act as guarantors. However, the result of the negotiations with the Shanghai Four Joint Office was that the office mainly handled production loans that required collateral and was limited to counties with branch offices of the four banks. The industrial and commercial loan requested by this county should be applied for from the Nanjing Four Joint General Office. Subsequently, the business bureau of the Central Bank was consulted, and the reply was the same as that of the Four Joint Office. Therefore, after the representatives returned with the report, the county government has reported the situation to the provincial government and requested that it send a letter to the Nanjing Four Joint General Office to apply for a loan as soon as possible.</p>

On average, approximately 84,000 people turn 21 each year. Approximately 60% of those who fail the physical examination, and only 40% are qualified, totaling more than 30,000 people. Using a lottery system, the number of people conscripted each year is not very large, so conscription is not difficult.</p>

<p>Upon learning that public funding for students in middle and higher education across the country would be completely terminated starting from New Year's Day in the 36th year of the Republic, we students were extremely surprised. Witnessing the internal strife and the government's neglect of many affairs today, we already feel deeply troubled and at a loss. Yet, the government continues to disregard education and impose harsh measures on students. We cannot help but feel heartbroken about our national culture! We cannot help but shed tears for the bleak reality!</p>
<p>Our country endured eight years of resistance against Japan, during which material and financial resources were severely depleted. In the occupied territories, schools were forced to relocate, teachers and students were displaced, and life was precarious. Even affording food and clothing became difficult, let alone affording to study. In areas that had not been ravaged by the enemy, people made donations for the country and became impoverished. As a result, some of our classmates till the land for others, while others serve in menial jobs (at National Sichuan University, some students clean the blackboard for the school, some work as shop assistants, some work as postal assistants, and at Southwest Associated University, students dig and weed for others). They willingly endure hardship and often go hungry, but they bear the heavy responsibility of the nation's fate, so what more can they say? What they hope for is that after victory, the world will be bright again, and they can continue their studies. But now, hearing of the cancellation of public funding, the poor will have no opportunity for advanced studies, and how can talented individuals be cultivated?</p>
<p>Examining the public funding system, it has a long history. The Han dynasty records state that Wen Weng established schools in Chengdu, recruiting talented young people from the lower counties to become "school officials' disciples." This is an example. Later generations followed this system in the imperial examinations, establishing "Chen students" who were given a stipend by the government. In the second year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming dynasty, each person received six dou of rice per month, and the government provided fish and meat. The number of students increased, known as "extended students." As a result, even poor scholars could rise in society. In modern times, the Soviet Union provided each university student with more than twenty rubles per month in 1937. This salary was more than enough to rival a small civil servant. In the United States, the national education budget accounts for more than 30% of the total budget. The emphasis on education is evident. As a result, both major countries have flourishing science and culture, standing side by side in the East and West. Looking back at our country's education budget today, it accounts for less than 6% of the total budget. Yet, the government still wants to reduce this small amount to supplement military spending (military spending accounts for 75% of our country's budget today). This can truly be described as squeezing the last bit of profit from the end of the sword and being good at "reducing expenses."</p>
<p>Throughout Chinese and foreign history, great heroes and outstanding figures, authorities in the scientific community, and leaders in the philosophical community have often come from humble backgrounds. Western orphanages and poorhouses have also been able to nurture outstanding talents. From this, we can see that talented people do not necessarily have to be the sons of wealthy families. Yet, our wise government is going against historical principles, setting an unreasonable precedent, and exploiting and suppressing the poor. We believe that this will only lead to a situation where "the upper class has no poor origins, and the lower class has no educated families." When interests clash and values are inverted, bank employees and profiteers are well-fed and well-clothed, while professors who rack their brains and students who study diligently are thin and tattered. Isn't this a strange phenomenon? Mr. Wu Youling said: "In the past, when Wei Zheng wrote the preface to the scholars' biographies, he often said that scholars of ancient times had a livelihood, but scholars of today are plagued by poverty. Intelligent people will not be willing to remain in their studies and seek poverty. This is why there are few polymaths among scholars, and learning is often vulgar." It is known that changing customs and habits must start with education. Otherwise, how can we reverse this declining trend?</p>
<p>For the sake of national construction, for the sake of national culture, and for the sake of the future development of higher education, we must protest, and we must protest strongly. We also make a reasonable appeal to the public with the most ardent and painful feelings, hoping to receive your strong support so that the government will give the greatest importance to education today, maintain the public funding system, and cultivate a favorable research environment to achieve the national construction mission of education. This will not only be fortunate for young students, but society and the nation will also benefit greatly.</p>

<p>Protest Against New Year's Rent Increase</p>
<p>The reader lives in a three-room sublet at No. 950, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi. Last year, they received a New Year's gift from the landlord, Gongji Shantang - a notice stating that the rent would be increased by three and a half times starting from January of this year. Upon hearing this, the common people felt both cold and frightened because although the landlord's increase of three and a half times to the second landlord isn't much, the second landlord will increase the rent by at least ten times to the third subtenant. Second landlords in this city rely on this for a living and increase rent to the third subtenants. This is a common phenomenon. Moreover, those who live in Nanshi and Zhabei are truly common people. At a time when all industries are declining, how can the common people bear the burden? (A Third Subtenant)</p>
<p>A Mounted Patrol Officer's Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in your newspaper the news released by the Municipal Council, including the inquiries from Councilors Ding Zhaoming and Lu Sachu to the police bureau regarding the mounted patrol. As a member of the mounted patrol, I feel compelled to clarify certain points. Councilors Ding Shanming and others said, "There have been robbery cases in Beixinjing every night recently. Can the mounted patrol go to patrol and suppress the area?" The mounted patrol stationed in the West Shanghai branch, in addition to being dedicated to patrolling the area day and night, has also been assigned a detachment by the headquarters to assist in patrolling. There are records in the Xinqiong Sub-bureau's logbook, and newspapers have published news such as "Bandits are waiting for opportunities, and mounted police discovered them and scattered them. Last night, there was a shootout between police and bandits on Lincoln Road, and they fled in all directions. They were still searching late at night." This can be confirmed. Around New Year's Day, we received orders to not take holidays or rest and to increase patrols. Every day, we depart from the headquarters at 5 PM and continue until 5 AM the next morning. We spend the long nights wading through wind, rain, and mud in the suburbs. Who knows that while others are dreaming sweetly, we are working in the cold and hunger? I hope that your newspaper will reveal our actual situation so that the gentlemen know our mission. "Ziming" East of the Sichuan Road Bridge along the Suzhou River used to be the Chinese Garden. It is now paved with coal cinders and has become a parking lot for cars. It is public land of the city. Since it was opened as a parking lot, initially, because there were concrete steps at the entrance that were not leveled, it was inconvenient for cars to enter and exit, and few vehicles went to park there. Later, after leveling a few places, cars gradually parked there. However, a large part of the open space is piled with thousands of empty oil drums, and another part is occupied by ship repairers, some used as carpentry shops, and some piled with scrap steel plates removed from ships. There are many types, too many to list. As a citizen, I see that this great public land is not being properly utilized, so I raise the following questions and would like the relevant authorities to answer them: (1) Since the land has been designated as a parking lot, it should be rectified, and public telephones and managers should be set up to designate vehicle positions and entry and exit routes on the ground. It should not remain unmanaged like an empty space. At the same time, if there is a public telephone, even car owners from far away can come to park. If a small fee is charged, the management costs can also be covered. (2) It is also not appropriate to pile public property on the site. Since it has been designated as a parking lot, it should be used as a parking lot. Otherwise, if the boundaries are not clear, the entry and exit of goods may inevitably collide with cars, and car owners will definitely not want their vehicles to be damaged while parked. (3) If the goods piled on the site are commercial goods, and permission is granted by a certain agency or individual to pile them there, is a fee charged, and does the fee go to the public? (4) If the public sector does not charge a fee for the piled goods, is there a third party taking the opportunity to charge a fee? Relevant agencies cannot turn a blind eye and allow public land to be used for free. In short, I hope that the relevant agencies will promptly answer these questions and give the land a reasonable use. In this period of city treasury deficits, being able to use the land to increase city revenue will also help reduce the burden on citizens. (Shen Yu Guang)</p>
<h3>Postal Matters</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Zheng Jimin: Regarding your letter stating the slow postal delivery between Qingpu and Jingjiang, we received a reply from the Jiangsu Postal Administration stating that your letter did not include an address, so they could not process it. Please provide Mr. Zheng's address so that they can retrieve the relevant envelope and investigate the cause of the delay. This is conveyed specifically for your information, please contact the Postal Administration directly.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Zhang Buming: Regarding your letter asking about the election of district chiefs in this city, we received a reply from the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government stating: "The qualifications of district chief candidates, according to regulations, are that they must be citizens of this district who have passed the Class A or B civil service candidate examination or review, and the current chairman of the district people's representative assembly and the current district chief can participate as candidates if they meet the above qualification requirements. There are no regulations or procedures for suppression." This is conveyed to you.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Zhang Bingnan: Regarding your letter regarding the demobilization of young soldiers, we received a reply from the Ministry of National Defense stating, "The Ministry of National Defense has been handling the collection and training of unemployed military officers as a major plan for the government's military demobilization. Since its implementation, it has repeatedly extended the deadline for collection and training and has repeatedly relaxed the standards for collection and training to take care of the actual difficulties of those seeking training. All officers who served the country during the war of resistance and did not defect mid-way have been accommodated as much as possible to give them the opportunity for further education and career change. Those who cannot continue to serve will be processed for retirement and protected by law. Simplification of the collection and training procedures has also been improved. The statement in Mr. Zhang's original letter that "there are those who are rejected because they are not military school students or National Army" is not the truth." This is the reply.</p>

<h3>Joint Defense of the Spitsbergen Archipelago: Soviet Union and Norway Reach Basic Agreement, Moscow Publicly Discusses Negotiations, Arouses British Reaction, U.S. Remains Temporarily Silent</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th] Soviet Radio officially announced that the Norwegian and Soviet governments have reached a basic agreement on negotiations to revise the Paris Treaty of 1928 regarding the Spitsbergen Archipelago. Negotiations had been conducted in 1944-45 and reopened last month. At that time, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the Norwegian Foreign Minister at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and the matter was raised again. Both sides believed that it was necessary to jointly defend the island.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union proposed three reasons for revising the treaty: (1) The Soviet government did not participate in the drafting of the treaty, and some countries that participated in drafting the treaty later fought against the Allied powers. (2) The treaty stipulates that Mitvitch Island be ceded to Norway, but the island actually belonged to the Soviet Union before. (3) The current status of Spitsbergen is economically and defensively unfavorable to the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative stated during the negotiations that before the war, the Soviet Navy received coal from the Soviet coal mines on Spitsbergen, which accounted for 400,000 tons of the annual output of 650,000 tons. The radio station later stated that Spitsbergen's position was extremely important in World War II.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 15th] A British Foreign Office spokesman today questioned the Soviet Union's new claim to Mitvitch Island in the Spitsbergen Archipelago. He stated that the international treaty of 1920 demilitarized the island, and the Soviet Union is still bound by this treaty. "The area is Norwegian territory, and we do not know what right the Soviet Union has to claim any island in the area." According to the Soviet TASS news agency, an "authoritative Soviet source" said that Mitvitch Island "is actually a Soviet island" and declared that the Soviet Union and Norway have agreed that "joint defense" is necessary in the area. The 1920 treaty is still valid because some of its signatories fought against the United Nations. This refers to Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Regarding the rumor that Norway and the Soviet Union have reached a basic agreement on "jointly defending the Spitsbergen Archipelago when necessary," officials at the State Department here refused to comment until they received an official report from Moscow.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The United States today offered a $100 million line of credit to Italy. This is the result of Prime Minister De Gasperi's visit to the United States. Three hours after the Export-Import Bank announced the matter, De Gasperi boarded a plane to return home. The bank also told Italian representative Cambieri that individual credit loans from the United States to Italian industries would depend entirely on the stability of Italy and the imports it needs. Official interpretation of this statement implies a warning that political turmoil in Italy may cause the bank to change its initial intention.</p>

<h3>Security Council Discusses Procedures, China and Britain Approve, U.S. Advocates</h3>
<p>Discussion of Atomic Control Should Come First</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] The United Nations Security Council will meet tomorrow to discuss the issue of world disarmament. It is rumored that China and Britain have decided to support the U.S. request to discuss the control of atomic energy first. It is said that U.S. Chief Representative Austin has received notification from Secretary of State Marshall confirming that he does not intend to change the State Department's established atomic energy control policy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 14th] Well-informed sources announced today that when the United Nations Security Council meets tomorrow to review the general disarmament plan, U.S. Representative Austin will demand that the discussion of the atomic energy control plan be limited to before the 4th of next month and will insist on an immediate vote. The U.S. chose the 4th of next month as the deadline for two reasons: (1) to avoid unnecessary delays; (2) to allow representatives of various countries to consult with their governments in a timely manner. The Soviet side had originally advocated that the disarmament plan should be discussed in its entirety. The British side believed that the U.S. and Soviet positions were not irreconcilable, but it was feared that tomorrow's meeting would not be able to reach any solution.</p>
<h3>Spanish Envoy to Britain Recalled</h3>

<h3>Famine Remains Severe, Twelve Countries Request Relief</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 14th] Twelve countries that have suffered from war, including the Philippines, Korea, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, China, Italy, Hungary, Austria, Finland, and Abyssinia, submitted requests to the United Nations expert committee last week, informing them that the countries would need to transfer themselves to the United Nations agencies. Some countries, such as the United States, have indicated that they are prepared to carry out relief efforts independently after the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ends its work, but they did not expect the amount requested to be so large. According to Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee will undoubtedly discuss legislation to engage in such relief efforts to supplement the work of the United Nations, and is currently discussing allocating $40 million for relief purposes.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives Meeting: Discussion of the German Treaty First; Netherlands and Czechoslovakia Submit Memoranda; Debate to be Public, Reporters Allowed to Observe</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] The four deputy foreign ministers reached an agreement last night on which of the German and Austrian peace treaties should be discussed first, after a compromise suggestion was made by the French representative, Mr. Meville. It is reported that discussions on the German issue will begin this morning, and it is not yet certain whether the discussions on Austria will continue this afternoon. Before reaching the agreement, there was a lengthy discussion. The British representative, Mr. Strung, suggested discussing the Austrian issue in the morning and the German issue in the afternoon. The actual issue is whether Germany and Austria should be treated equally and simultaneously. The United Kingdom and the United States want to quickly resolve the Austrian issue. As the British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in his opening remarks, Austria is the link between the East and the West, and all Western countries want to prevent Germany from becoming an aggressor again. The meaning of this is self-evident. It is also learned that the four deputy foreign ministers have decided to make the debate public, and reporters can attend and observe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The Czech Foreign Minister today broadcast on Prague Radio, briefly outlining the main points of the memorandum submitted by Czechoslovakia to the four foreign ministers' representatives meeting. According to him, "We believe that regardless of whether the future German political system is federal or centralized, the strictest control by the Allies is urgently needed."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The U.S. State Department revealed today that the Netherlands has submitted a memorandum to the deputy foreign ministers' meeting, demanding that Germany compensate for all occupation expenses and adopt strict measures to ensure the disarmament of Germany. In addition, it also requested that the Ruhr and Rhineland regions be changed to a country.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 15th Broadcast: Australia requested that all small allies be allowed to participate in the four-power discussions on peace treaties. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister expressed opposition, while the British Deputy Foreign Minister believed that it should be considered.</p>
<h3>Election of the President of the French Assembly; Presidential Election to be Held Today; De Gaulle Unwilling to Run as a Candidate; Provisional Government Holds Last Meeting of Great Importance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] General de Gaulle is unwilling to run for president of the French Fourth Republic, but at least 30 other French people are willing to be presidential candidates. Who will be elected will be decided by the National Assembly in the presidential election on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] The French provisional government is scheduled to hold its last meeting a few hours before the election of the President of the Republic at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th, which is of great importance. Prime Minister Blum will personally preside over the meeting and report on his trip to London. Colonial Minister Moutet will also report on the situation in Vietnam.</p>

The leader of the Socialist Party, Mr. Auriol, was elected as the Speaker of the National Assembly in the first round of voting, receiving 294 votes out of 575. The candidate of the People's Republican Party, former Finance Minister Schumann, lost with 194 votes. The competition for the position of Speaker of the Senate of the Republic was fierce, with four candidates: Mr. Le Beaul, the former speaker of the People's Republican Party, Mr. Maran of the Communist Party, Mr. Robé of the Socialist Party, and Mr. Gassé of the Radical Socialist Party. As a result, Mr. Le Beaul was elected in the third round of voting with 129 votes, due to his age.</p>
<p>Major Dispute Between Left and Right Wing Members</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] When the French National Assembly opened today, a major incident was triggered by the Vietnam issue, which was the result of the right-wing opposition to the opening remarks of Mr. Giachino, the head of the Communist Party parliamentary delegation. Mr. Giachino said: "We believe that the French people hope that 1947 will bring us a peaceful resolution to the Vietnam dispute. French workers recognize that conducting a new colonial war is extremely dangerous. It is not too late to resume negotiations with the Viet Minh based on the March 1946 agreement. What France is currently and will be concerned about is stopping this bloodshed and implementing a policy of peace and order in Vietnam. Equal peace can still be achieved." When Mr. Giachino spoke to this point, the right-wing and center-wing members immediately responded with resistance and hostile shouts. While the communist members applauded enthusiastically, the opposition began to bang on the table to cover up the applause. Most of the right-wing representatives immediately left the scene, and half of the Radical Socialist Party representatives also followed suit, but order was finally restored.</p>
<h3>Draft of the Austrian Peace Treaty Drawn Up by the United Kingdom and the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lee Chisholm, 14th] The diplomatic reporter of the Texarkana Gazette stated: Although the British draft of the Austrian treaty has not been published, its content has been learned, including nine main points: (1) establishing a free and independent Austria; (2) withdrawing Allied troops stationed in Austria; (3) free navigation of the Danube River; (4) supporting Austria's accession to the United Nations organizations; (5) restoring the Austrian border of 1938; (6) not recognizing Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia's territorial claims against Austria; (7) not demanding reparations; (8) complete freedom of religion, no discrimination in trade; (9) only factories established by Germany in Austria after 1938 may be considered German capital. The diplomatic reporter also said that the US draft is similar to this. The United Kingdom and the United States will also advocate that Austria maintain its public security forces to protect its borders.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Hanoi, 14th] There is little hope of an early end to the Vietnam War. The reporter met with officials in charge of both sides, and the impression gained and the opinions of ordinary people are that a long period of bloody war is still needed before political negotiations can be resumed. The French have decided to stay in Vietnam, while the Viet Minh are trying to force them to withdraw.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] The Viet Minh radio station broadcast: French troops have landed in Da Nang, the central city on the east bank of Hanoi, and are advancing along the highway, attempting to relieve the French troops in Hue. Hue has been besieged for three weeks. Da Nang is 60 miles from Hue. The French side did not express any opinion on this report. At the same time, United Press Hanoi reported that a Viet Minh military organization called the "Self-Defense Corps" has appeared with 1,000 members, attempting to break out of the besieged area of Hanoi. Yesterday, several assaults were repelled by the French army, and the war will continue afterwards. The authorities are now working hard to restore normalcy in areas outside the war zone. A theater in Hanoi that has not been damaged has reopened, and the audience is crowded.</p>

I have replied to Colonel Ho Ning, asking him to come here around the 23rd of this month to discuss this plan together."</p>
<h3>Nomonhan Battle; Over Ten Thousand Japanese Soldiers Killed; Ashes Discovered in Northeast Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The ashes of more than 10,000 Japanese soldiers who died in the conflict between the Japanese army and the Soviet Union on the Nomonhan border between Siberia and Northeast China in 1939 were accidentally discovered in Ichikawa Castle, Chiba Road, northeast of Tokyo. These were the ashes of the Guofutai troops (who were annihilated during the battle with the Soviet Union at that time). The ashes were discovered by a person who demolished a part of a completed war memorial monument under the order of the Japanese government. No one knows when and how this ash was buried under the unfinished monument, because the administrator is deceased and all the documents were lost during the war. This was obviously secretly hidden by the Japanese military authorities under the unfinished monument to cover up the true losses of Japan in the Nomonhan War.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Visited the Emperor Twice Yesterday; Three-Party Cabinet to be Established; Internal Negotiations Continue</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 15th] The work of forming a coalition cabinet centered on Prime Minister Yoshida is progressing smoothly. In addition to the Socialist Party convening a standing committee today, it was very quiet on the surface, but the government and the Socialist Party have been in considerable contact. The qualifications of the candidate for the new cabinet are also being investigated. Yoshida visited the Emperor twice in the morning and afternoon to report on the current situation. The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party did not make any motion on the grounds that the government had not officially expressed its will. However, because Mr. Suzuki Mo Saburo and Mr. Kato Kanji published their left-wing policy guidelines without consulting the party organs in advance, they were accused by the right-wing and center-wing factions of being a split action. The internal negotiations between the government and the Socialist Party have progressed to the number of people who will enter the cabinet and the chair. The Socialist Party may have four to five people enter the cabinet. Committee Chairman Katayama and Secretary-General Nishio will serve as state ministers, Hirano Rizo will serve as Minister of Agriculture, Matsuoka Komakichi will serve as Minister of Labor, and Mizutani Chozaburo will serve as Minister of Commerce. Regarding the experience of all cabinet members, it is said that Yoshida will decide to have six from the Liberal Party, five from the Progressive Party, and four from the Socialist Party. The cabinet members from the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party will not have major changes.</p>

The retention or departure of other senior officials of the State Department will be decided by Marshall. Deputy Secretary of State Axon has long intended to return to his old law profession. He recently told President Truman that if Marshall wants him to stay, he can dispel his intention to resign. Another Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Clayton, is said to be planning to resign when his term of office comes to an end.</p>
<h3>Severe Labor Unrest in London; Urgently Seeking Negotiated Solution; Sympathy for Strikers Increasing</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] Mr. Shakesling, vice chairman of the British Trades Union Congress, declared that the labor unrest of 30,000 truck drivers and market workers is expected to be resolved through negotiations. Other workers should continue to work and wait for negotiations, without responding. However, 1,500 Thames barge workers have unanimously voted to strike and called on 4,000 other barge workers to strike unanimously today, and hope that 24,000 London dockworkers and 16,000 Liverpool dockworkers will join. Liverpool dockworkers leader Campbell, who led strikes twice in the past, advocated a "truce" of 72 hours during the negotiation period.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] The labor unrest of 30,000 truck drivers and market workers has expanded to dockworkers. At the same time, government, union, and industry leaders are urgently establishing negotiation mechanisms, hoping to resolve the labor unrest within 48 hours. The number of troops assigned to distribute food in the market by the labor unrest faction is increasing.</p>
<h3>Soviet Diplomatic Representative to Mexico Leaks Soviet Espionage Secrets</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] After Mr. Alexander Iv, former commercial counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, abandoned his position and refused to return to the Soviet Union, he recently gave a speech to reporters here, saying that Mr. Alexandrov, the Soviet observer who participated in the Bikini atomic bomb test, was actually a representative of the Soviet secret police. Although the Soviet Union has not yet learned the secrets of the atomic bomb, Soviet scientists are now trying their best to explore them and want to get to the bottom of it. Soviet spies are now conducting large-scale activities in the United States, especially concerned about the inside story of the atomic bomb.</p>
<h3>Charlton Dies; Another Weakness for the United States Next Week</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Lieutenant General Charlton, former commander of the U.S. Army General Inspector and former commander of the U.S. forces in the India-Burma theater, died today at Walter Reed Hospital.

<h3>Fog and Snow; Breaking Hurricanes; Human Power is Omnipotent!</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent plane crashes around the world, resulting in the deaths of more than 300 people, but this is not a new stimulus for scientists, who are determined to use human power to overcome nature.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Recently, there have been frequent plane crashes around the world, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The biggest reason is the fog at the airport, poor visibility, and failure to land safely. American climatologists are now mobilizing to study a permanent solution to manipulate the climate with human power.</p>
<p>Great Work May Take Several Years</p>
<p>And seek to disperse the fog around the airports to ensure safety. The U.S. Weather Bureau is now working jointly with the Army, Navy, and outstanding private scientists on a comprehensive research program that may take several years to achieve results, but all hope to know for sure whether a huge amount of human power, such as atomic energy or a large fire, can break sea hurricanes. Most of the world's storms, snowstorms, and the damage they cause are caused by these hurricanes. The question is how to recognize the brewing storm and break it with sufficient force, or divert it. The focus of the research is on a new type of calculation, which will be a million times faster than the current one. According to the proposed plan, the steps are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Obtain more facts in meteorology, emphasizing the laws of air movement, which requires universal observation around the world.</p>
<p>(2) Create mathematical formulas that contain many facts obtained from meteorological observations for calculations. The weather forecasts obtained are also based on formulas.</p>
<p>(3) Scientists will closely observe the generation of world storms to determine whether a large force can be used to break or divert them at any location in the storm. If this is possible, scientists will decide how humans can make a forceful counterattack against it. If atomic energy is used, they will also find ways to use it safely.</p>
<p>Changing the Climate is Still in its Early Stages</p>
<p>Humans have proven on a small scale that they can change the local climate. Mr. Shufer, director of the General Electric Experiment and Research Laboratory, drove a plane over the clouds and dropped a layer of dry ice. The observers on the ground immediately saw that the golf course was planning to conduct further research to tame the fog around the airports. Dr. Newman of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, is one of the world's most famous scholars. Several scientists are now working with him to calculate the application of meteorology to open up a new situation. Dr. Wechsler, director of the Climate Bureau's special science team, is also engaged in research. In addition, naval and army aviators and meteorologists, such as Professor Panofsky of New York University, Dr. Virey of the Alger Soil Academy, and Lieutenant Thomson, an aviation climate specialist, are all helping to solve all the problems. The Climate Bureau receives more than a dozen letters a week providing ideas for man-made climates. In fact, "rainmaking" was an ancient profession. The U.S. Morning Industry tested a theory in 1891 that if enough chemical bombs were exploded in or near the clouds, it could cause water vapor to precipitate. This was tested in Washington and Dunkirk and was able to cause rain. According to Dr. Kriss, the locations where most of the world's hurricanes occur have been determined, namely the South Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea, from which the storms on the east coast of the United States originate.</p>
<p>Others are the South Sea Islands, the Indian Ocean, and the western and southern Pacific. The storms that occur in the latter sweep across Japan and the Aleutian Islands, and their branches touch Canada and extend southeast to the United States, causing strong winds or heavy snow.</p>
<p>Burning Gasoline to Disperse Hurricanes</p>
<p>A scientist once suggested that when a hurricane is just beginning, if gasoline or kerosene is burned on the ocean surface at its source, the fire can split it into many small ones. Because the heat causes the air to rise, it can open up the stagnant air that remains on the ocean surface. Scientists believe that the occurrence of hurricanes is caused by this stagnant air. Dr. Wechsler does not yet know how to use atomic energy to break the hurricane. It is said that the hurricane is stagnant air, which emits a lot of heat. When the water vapor condenses into clouds, it will rain. Heat causes part of the air to rise, and the air around it takes the opportunity to enter, forming a large vortex, like water being released from a bathtub, but the air rotates and rises. This rotating air mass will move on the ocean surface. A Japanese scientist observed the typhoons in the Ryukyu Islands and estimated that the energy produced per second was equivalent to 400,000 tons of TNT explosives. Scientists have estimated that the explosive force of an atomic bomb is equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT, so 20 atomic bombs would have to be exploded in one second to be equal to the force of a typhoon in the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>U.S. Aircraft Reduced in Number</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] Most U.S. airlines admit that the number of passengers has decreased in recent days. For example, yesterday, only half of the 35 planes that flew from the West arrived here, and there were many empty seats. This is probably due to seasonal factors and recent plane crashes. This situation will soon improve.</p>
<p>[United Press, Puebla, Mexico, 14th] A Mexican G-54 military transport plane crashed at the airport here today, killing all four pilots and 18 officers. According to witnesses, one of the plane's engines fell to the ground shortly after takeoff, and the pilot's attempt to land again was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Mr. Wafferton, chairman of the House Interstate Commerce Committee, announced today that Congress has a plan to investigate plane crashes. Mr. Wafferton also said that Congress is considering authorizing the committee to summon airline employees. The committee has now taken steps to obtain all necessary information and is considering thoroughly investigating all plane crashes.</p>

<h3>National Government Commends Martyrs of the Local Press</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Reporters Association previously passed a motion during the "September 1st" Reporters' Day commemorative meeting, requesting the Central Propaganda Department to forward a request to the National Government to issue an order commending the martyrs of the local press who died during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and to provide compensation to their families. The National Government issued a commendation order on December 22nd of last year. The order has been sent by the Central Propaganda Department to the Shanghai News Reporters Association. The original letter is as follows: "Previously, your association reported a list of martyrs of the news media who died during the War of Resistance Against Japan and their deeds, requesting that they be forwarded to the National Government for commendation and compensation to their families. After the Central Propaganda Department forwarded the letter to the Civil Service Department of the National Government, it was replied that: "By order of the National Government on December 22nd of the 35th year, it is hereby ordered: 'During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the patriots of the news media in the occupied areas faced the enemy's flames, did not fear the strong, promoted national policies, and were strict and unyielding, thus incurring the enemy's jealousy and harming them recklessly. In the past few years, the number of martyrs who died one after another, even in Shanghai, has reached as many as 15. In addition to Shao Lubai, Zhang Sixu, Jin Huating, and Li Junying, who have already been commended by order, all the reporters who died, Zhu Xinggong, Cheng Zhenzhang, Zhao Guodong, Feng Mengyun, Zhou Weishan, Qin Jinghuan, Chen Tongxuan, Wu Hongshao, Zhu Mingchun, Wang Anlu, Chen Kunlin, etc., all sacrificed themselves for the country, and their loyalty is admirable. They should be commended by order and given a pension of 30,000 yuan each to show their loyalty.' This order." Therefore, it is hereby replied, and it is hoped that you will take note and inform us of the compliance." To the Shanghai News Reporters Association, Central Propaganda Department.</p>

<h3>Pro-Japanese White Russian Intellectual Granted Bail of 10 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Alexander Panlin, a White Russian, was tried yesterday in the High Court. The defendant was old and frail, with a white beard, and had difficulty walking, requiring assistance to reach the court. The original indictment from the High Prosecutor's Office stated that the defendant was a known pro-Japanese White Russian intellectual. In the autumn of the 116th year (presumably of the Republic), when enemy troops attacked Shanghai, the defendant's "Schuss Magazine" published opinions unfavorable to China's resistance against Japan. He also served as the chief writer for the pro-Japanese White Russian newspaper "Russian Voice," using the name Antoloff to publish articles opposing the Soviet government and sowing discord between allied nations like Britain, America, and China. Furthermore, in the 28th year (presumably of the Republic), he served as an employee of the intelligence bureau of the enemy consulate in Shanghai, contacting accomplices in other cities to carry out pro-Japanese activities. When questioned, the defendant denied ever working for the enemy intelligence bureau and denied any contact with the Japanese. As for his past statements, he claimed they contained no pro-Japanese sentiments or anything detrimental to China's war of resistance. He presented a book of his past writings and clippings as proof. After the hearing, the defendant, citing his old age, requested bail. The collegiate panel ruled that he be released on bail of 10 million yuan, subject to being summoned at any time.</p>

<h3>Brothers in Misfortune Collude and Act Corruptly - Shao Yunxiang to be Ordered Arrested</h3>
<p>Shao Yunli, formerly the head of the puppet Tonghai District Tax Bureau, is the cousin of the traitor Shao Shi-jun.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was reported, but the defendant had already fled without a trace along with the traitor Shao Shi-jun. Now, the High Prosecutor's Office has concluded its investigation of the case, believing that Shao Yunxiang's guilt is certain. Although he has not surrendered to face interrogation, he was formally prosecuted yesterday according to law.

<h3>Sino-Argentine Commercial Treaty - Soon to be Signed - Argentine Chargé d'Affaires Talks - Hopes for Mutual Exchange of Students and Journalists</h3>
<p>Argentine Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General in Shanghai, Fineda, (see photo) told reporters yesterday that "Chinese Ambassador to Argentina Chen Jie, and He Molin, the head of the Chinese commercial delegation to Argentina, are conducting commercial negotiations with the Argentine government on behalf of the Chinese government. The new Sino-Argentine Commercial Treaty will be signed once the negotiations are completed." Mr. Fineda described the bright prospects for commercial relations between China and Argentina, saying "China and Argentina both have many unique products that the other lacks, such as silk, which is China's main export and is urgently needed by Argentina." Mr. Fineda firmly believes that after the signing of the new Sino-Argentine Commercial Treaty and the smooth operation of shipping, commercial relations between the two countries will inevitably develop. Mr. Fineda also stated that he has suggested to major shipping companies in his country that they have drafted plans to open direct shipping lines between China and Argentina.</p>
<p>Since arriving in China in August last year, Mr. Fineda has devoted much effort to promoting Sino-Argentine relations. During the Lunar New Year, he will present President Chiang with a sword he has worn for fifteen years, a prize awarded to him by former Argentine President Uriburu when he was studying at the Argentine Military Academy. With Mr. Fineda's efforts and assistance, the Sino-Argentine Chamber of Commerce and the Sino-Argentine Cultural and Social Association have been established. The latter's main purpose is to transport cloth and grain from Argentina to China to relieve shortages. Mr. Fineda sincerely stated, "Through the above two organizations, the Chinese people will understand Argentina more deeply, and at the same time, through similar organizations in Argentina, the Argentine people will gain a deeper understanding of China. China and Argentina have many things in common. The Argentine people greatly admire China's heroic resistance to fight for freedom, independence and democracy."</p>
<p>Mr. Fineda believes that the mutual exchange of students and journalists is extremely important for enhancing friendly understanding between the two countries. He said that he has suggested to his government to establish scholarships and honorary degrees for Chinese students. This suggestion is being considered by a special committee set up by the Argentine government. Mr. Fineda also said that Argentina welcomes journalists from all countries to engage in news reporting, because the ideal of freedom of the press has been realized after President Perón took office in Argentina.</p>
<p>At the recent meeting of the Shanghai Consular Corps, Mr. Fei suggested establishing a monument to the "unknown heroes" of China. Chen Guolian, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, wrote to Mr. Fei, praising the above suggestion as an epoch-making event in the history of Sino-Argentine diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>When asked about his views on the Chinese political situation, Mr. Fineda believes that the current difficult situation is inevitable after China's eight-year long war of resistance. He firmly believes that based on China's abundant resources and democratic spirit, peaceful unification will eventually be realized, because the recent National Assembly and the work of constitution-making not only fully demonstrate China's democratic spirit, but also guide China to move forward towards the goal of democracy.</p>

<h3>Mad Cow Causes Havoc, Runs Wild, and Injures People - North Zhejiang Road - A Scene of Chaos - Police Arrive to Stop the Illegal Act - What Does "Shot Cow Steak" Taste Like?</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Near North Zhejiang Road and Anqing Road (Avenue Edward VII), just when it was the rush hour of the morning market yesterday, suddenly there was a great uproar, and everyone saw vehicles and horses running wildly, and pedestrians running madly, and the order was in great chaos for a while. Then a head of cattle was seen, with eyes straight, running wildly. At that time, two pedestrians were knocked down to the ground because they couldn't avoid it in time. At that time, cars honked wildly, shouting loudly, and it was in a state of chaos. Therefore, the cattle heard the sound and became more and more terrified, and its crazy state was almost to an unmanageable point, and it was no longer possible for human power to stop it. Running east and west, jumping left and kicking right, it was like entering a no-man's land. After such a disturbance for a long time, it suddenly turned into Huaxing Road, and then turned its head and rushed to the mouth of Tianbao Lane, blocked by a bamboo fence. The mad cattle didn't care about anything, lowered its head and picked it up, with a bang,</p>
<p>broke away and entered. Unexpectedly, inside, there was a car factory. It happened that a worker named Ni Qijin was bending over to repair a car. The mad cattle was ignorant and could not distinguish between kindness and hatred. As soon as he saw the horns pointing down, Ni Qijin had been rushed out more than ten feet away, lying injured and unable to get up. At that time, the mad cattle suddenly turned and ran out again, re-entering the road. People became more and more frightened. At that time, the matter had spread all over the northern district. Soon, two policemen from the North Station post learned about it and ran to the scene with guns. They ordered the passersby to move away on both sides, and immediately raised their guns and fired at the mad cattle. After eight shots, the mad cattle finally collapsed to the ground. At that time, the cattle owner, a local farmer named Tan Shaoxing, also ran to the scene, horrified.</p>
<p>did not know what to do.</p>
<p>After investigation by the police, it was learned that Tan Shaoxing had led the cattle from Beiyangjing in the morning, originally intending to wait for the price to sell it, but unexpectedly, when walking to North Zhejiang Road, two naughty children chased the cattle from behind with tree branches. The cattle was frightened and ran wildly, and then this farce occurred. Afterwards, the dead cattle was still returned to the farmer and resold to the slaughterhouse. It is expected that yesterday some restaurants in Shanghai may have "shot cow steak" for sale.</p>

<h3>Ms. Zhai Guiru Returns from Studying Abroad - Talks About the General Situation of Women's Lives in the United States - More Women than Men, Generally Experiencing a Shortage of Men - Social Life Absolutely Open, Especially Many Cases of Divorce</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Ms. Zhai Guiru, the wife of Zhou Jingwen, a leader of the China Democratic League, recently returned from studying in the United States. Yesterday afternoon, she chatted with reporters about her experience studying in the United States and the general situation of women's lives in the United States.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhai went to the United States two years ago, and the purpose of her going abroad was purely for travel. She studied home economics at Manhattan College in New York and Mary College in Pennsylvania. Both schools are women's colleges, so Ms. Zhai is relatively clear about the problems of American women, especially the living conditions of female students, and has done some research, so the focus of our conversation has also shifted to this aspect.</p>
<p>Women's Colleges are Aristocratic. According to Ms. Zhai, the current United States is generally experiencing a "shortage of men." Perhaps it is the result of the war. According to the results of the US population statistics, there are more women than men. This situation is especially important in New York City, because women in rural areas are more willing to come to the city to learn fashion, so the ratio of men to women in New York is ten to one. Therefore, unmarried men are regarded as the most precious in the eyes of New York ladies. Every female student will jump for joy as long as she can get an invitation from a boyfriend on a holiday! Even if it is just to drink a cup of the most ordinary coffee, she will consider it as the highest honor, and must make a joyful boast to her girlfriends!</p>
<p>Most of the women's colleges in the United States are relatively aristocratic. In addition to imparting basic skills for self-reliance, the schools also focus on etiquette in social situations, with the aim of training them to become virtuous wives and good mothers who are good at communication. Every time at dinner, everyone must change into long evening gowns, and every move must be in accordance with etiquette. Every time a festival comes, the school specially holds a dance party to allow each student to invite their boyfriend to dance. In addition, swimming, playing ball, riding horses... the study life is easy and happy.</p>
<p>Satisfying the Desire to Love Beauty</p>
<p>In this comfortable life, American women, and even men, can be said to pay little attention to politics. Women spend most of their time and money on makeup and clothing. New York fashion companies are quite amazing, changing new patterns almost every two or three days, and you can't catch up unless you're a multi-millionaire.</p>
<p>Working women account for most of the total number of women in the United States, and typists account for most of the working women. Most of their goals in working are to earn some money so that they can dress themselves up more beautifully. Because cosmetics are so expensive, it is difficult to satisfy their desire to love beauty with their husband's limited income, so they have to find something to do to subsidize it.</p>
<p>Many Lost Children</p>
<p>What about the children when housewives have jobs? There are no large-scale nurseries in New York, and the situation in the United States is different from that in the country, and you can hand over the children to the nanny. In the United States, a nanny's monthly salary is 100 US dollars, which is exactly equal to the entire salary of a clerk, so very few people are willing to go to the nanny. Americans live in bungalows, drive cars, but they can't afford nannies. Therefore, mothers have to leave their children at home at will, so there are many lost children in the US police station. There are also terrible disasters caused by this. Just recently, in a family in New York City, when the parents were both out working, the seven-year-old brother joked by closing the three-year-old brother in a large wooden box, and as a result, he suffocated him alive.</p>
<p>Why Hit Oneself</p>
<p>Social life in the United States is absolutely open. Any woman can go out dancing, eating, and watching movies with a man she has never met. The result of a life that is too romantic is that there are particularly many divorces. There is a city of Reno in the United States, which is famous for its divorces? Americans call it Divorce City, where the laws are particularly free for divorce. Therefore, when either party of a Reno husband or wife intends to divorce, they only need to go to Reno once, and they can complete all the procedures in a few hours.</p>
<p>It is said that Sino-US relations are frequent, but the understanding of China by the general American people is still limited. At least in their eyes, China has regressed for dozens of years. Especially their observations on the political situation in our country are even more superficial. They wonder why the Chinese always change their internal war? The uninterrupted civil war in China for many years has made them feel that the Chinese have a good war nature, and every Chinese is a war-mongering. When they meet Chinese people, nine out of ten ask: "Why do you always like to hit your own people!"</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Ms. Zhai sighed and said that whenever she heard this kind of question, she always felt unspeakably sad. In fact, which Chinese people want to have war again?</p>
<h3>Department of Agriculture and Forestry Actively Plans for Coastal Fisheries and Initiates Seaweed Farming, Requests Assistance from Shanghai Municipal Government via Telegram</h3>
<p>To develop coastal fisheries and improve the livelihood of fishermen, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to organize fishermen's groups and launch literacy campaigns among fishermen. To facilitate the implementation of these measures, the Department has sent letters to local authorities throughout the country requesting assistance. The Shanghai Municipal Government received a telegram from the Department yesterday, stating: "Our country has a long coastline and extensive fishing grounds, with fishing ports scattered along the coast and islands. Fishing vessels operate in both the high seas and territorial waters. Over seven million people directly and indirectly rely on fisheries for their livelihood. Therefore, the 'Fishermen's Movement' is of utmost importance. Before the war, coastal fishermen had limited knowledge and lacked sound organization, leading to distant fishing grounds being exploited by foreigners, resulting in encroachment on fishing resources. Consequently, fishing villages were on the verge of bankruptcy, and many fishermen resorted to banditry. The War of Resistance began, severely impacting coastal areas. Over the past eight years, the situation has further deteriorated, with fishermen displaced and losing their livelihoods. Now that victory has been achieved and territories have been recovered, fishermen are returning to their hometowns to resume their occupations. To facilitate the development of coastal fisheries and improve the livelihood of fishermen, it is imperative to start with the organization of fishermen and the launch of literacy campaigns. This will help reorganize fishing villages, educate fishermen, improve their skills, and enhance their living standards, while also collectively protecting fishing resources. This approach will not only have widespread and profound effects but will also lay the foundation for future coastal fisheries development, ensuring the smooth implementation of fisheries administration. This matter concerns the livelihood of our country's fishermen and requires the active assistance of the Department's marine fisheries supervisors in various districts to remedy the situation." After receiving the document, the Municipal Government instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Trains Inspection Personnel</h3>
<p>Since its post-war restoration, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been making tireless efforts in commodity inspection and other related work. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, they recently submitted a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs outlining the work to be carried out this year. The main points are (1) expanding the internal organization, (2) training inspection personnel, and (3) researching commodities. The three main points are explained as follows: (1) Before the war, the Bureau had offices on the fourth and ninth floors. Since the restoration, all personnel have been working on the ninth floor, which is too small and has hampered operations. Therefore, the Bureau will first acquire additional office space before undertaking other tasks. (2) The Bureau's main work is technical, but over the years, there has been a shortage of skilled commodity inspection personnel. In the future, the Bureau plans to recruit and train such personnel. (3) Commodities that dominate the market, both domestically and internationally, are those with excellent quality. The Bureau needs to not only inspect the quality of commodities but also conduct research to continuously improve them. This is crucial for international trade, so research efforts will be strengthened.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Over one thousand Chinese staff members of the former Shanghai Municipal Council's police force and fire brigade, seeking the return of savings, retirement funds, and pensions deducted by the Municipal Council during their employment, gathered at the Bund English Consulate on the 12th of this month to petition. At that time, the English Consul responded that he would consult with Mayor Wu and provide feedback on the 15th. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, these thousand-plus retired Chinese staff members gathered again on the lawn in front of the English Consulate to await news.</p>
<p>The English Consulate stated that all assets and creditor's rights of the former Shanghai Municipal Council had been transferred to the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government would be responsible for settling the debts. Therefore, the Consulate notified Sun Yushu, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and Dong Shoupeng, Director of the Municipal Government's Foreign Affairs Office, to meet with the petition representatives at the Consulate yesterday morning. Sun and others explained to the crowd that, according to the regulations for the takeover of the former Concessions, the current debts were the responsibility of the Municipal Government, and therefore everyone should recognize the proper target for their petitions. Regarding the issue of the Municipal Government returning these savings, a liquidation committee had been organized with relevant agencies to seek a solution. Furthermore, Mayor Wu was extremely concerned about everyone's situation, and representatives should be sent to the Municipal Government to discuss settlement methods. However, the crowd persisted in negotiating with the English Consulate and became increasingly agitated. By 2:00 PM, there was still no resolution. Mayor Wu personally went to the English Consulate to speak to the crowd, urging them to send representatives through proper channels to seek a reasonable solution. After 4:00 PM, the petitioners left the English Consulate and went to the Municipal Government, sending nine representatives, along with Yao Jiarui, the former Chinese Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, to meet with the Mayor.</p>
<p>The Mayor first said, "I must handle this matter whether you petition me or the English. Both will be done". He sincerely explained that the Municipal Government had established a liquidation committee in August of last year to handle similar matters. However, due to the complex and numerous accounts, it was difficult to clear them up quickly. Furthermore, it was necessary to seek instructions from the central government before implementation. He would now urge Director Gu of the Finance Bureau to expedite the matter and do his best to consider everyone's situation, increasing the payment amount as much as possible. He also stated that representatives and Yao Jiarui could meet at any time to discuss the matter. Finally, he advised them that "debts have owners," and the Municipal Government had recognized everyone as creditors. They should not gather and petition the English Consulate again to avoid unnecessary trouble, as it concerned the honor of the country. He hoped everyone would pay special attention to this. The representatives were satisfied with the Mayor's words, and the petitioning crowd dispersed in the sound of "Entrust our Mayor to be everyone's representative," bringing a temporary end to the incident.</p>

<h3>Production Association Organizes Loans for 50 Small and Medium-Sized Factories, Urgently Seeking Relief to Pass the New Year, Collateral Secured with Goods Pledged on a Monthly Basis, to be Repaid Next Spring, Hoping Interest Rates will be One-Third Lower than Black Market Rates</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Production Loan Committee for Small and Medium-Sized Factories, organized by the China Production Association, held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM in the grand auditorium of the National Goods Exhibition Marketplace at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Meibai Road in this city. Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Wang Xiaolai attended. The meeting was presided over by the Vice Chairman of the Association, Hu Boxiang, who reported on the preparatory process. Li Jishen then delivered a speech, stating that China's industry is backward and the social economy has not yet stabilized since the victory. At a time when the crisis in the business community is deepening, the government has implemented measures to provide production loans, but these are limited to large factories. In reality, it is the small and medium-sized factories that urgently need relief. Recently, there has been a surge in factory closures in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, and the majority of these are small and medium-sized factories. Therefore, to stabilize domestic order, the government and the people must cooperate with each other.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai stated that factories in our country, regardless of their size, are currently facing enormous crises. The National Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have all requested relief from the government. Relief can be divided into two steps: first, to diagnose the illness, that is, to understand the difficulties and then prescribe the right medicine; the second step is to restore health. In the government's current production loan law, if only raw materials and finished products are allowed as collateral, and factory buildings and machinery cannot be used as collateral, then the city's industry and commerce will not be able to develop. The financial and industrial and commercial sectors are interconnected. Without the industrial and commercial sectors, there would be no financial sector. He hoped that the financial sector could pay attention to this and seek to flourish together. Wang also used the analogy of the state and the people, saying that the state is like the financial sector, and the people are like the industrial and commercial sector. If the state does not care about the livelihood of the people, then when the people cannot survive, there will inevitably be great turmoil and revolution.</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, stating that production loans are slightly different from industrial loans. Industrial loans only allow raw materials and finished products as collateral, which may result in raw materials and finished products becoming stagnant and stockpiled. Therefore, this is a contradiction: on the one hand, production is to be increased, and on the other hand, raw materials are allowed to be stockpiled. The government's current production loans have been improved somewhat, with half of the collateral being allowed in the form of factory buildings and machinery, but this is limited to large factories. Generally, small and medium-sized factories are still unable to obtain loans. In fact, small and medium-sized factories have a significant impact on social and economic order, as well as on commodity prices and the daily lives of citizens. Therefore, the Shanghai branch of the China Production Promotion Association's initiative to provide production loans to small and medium-sized factories is extremely meaningful. He hoped that all sectors would promote this initiative and that fruitful results would be achieved through close cooperation between the financial and industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>Subsequently, committee members of the association, Sheng Gongshu and Shen Hefeng, reported on the progress of their work, stating that there are over fifty small factories urgently in need of relief before the Lunar New Year. The association has sent over two hundred letters to commercial banks in the city, but there have been no concrete results yet. Factory owners have expressed their willingness to comply with all loan procedures and have collateral and guarantors. They only seek to get through this Lunar New Year and will repay the loans next spring. They only hope that the interest rates will be one-third lower than the current black market rates and hope that the financial sector will provide assistance.</p>
<h3>National Goods Exhibition Marketplace Closed Yesterday: Permanent Venue to be Built on the Original Site</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The National Goods Exhibition Marketplace, sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Association, officially closed yesterday after its term expired. The closing ceremony was held at 4:00 PM yesterday in the grand auditorium of the marketplace on Jing'an Temple Road. Over five hundred people attended, including prominent figures from the business community and representatives from various factories. The ceremony began promptly amidst music. Mayor Wu was unable to attend due to official duties and was represented by Counselor Ge Kexin. The closing ceremony was presided over by Marketplace Committee member Hu Boxiang, who reported that the purpose of holding the National Goods Exhibition Marketplace was to arouse the attention of the Chinese people to national goods in order to compete with foreign goods. The Marketplace Director Jiang Zhonghe and the Secretary of the Industrial Association, Tian Heqing, then delivered speeches, clarifying that the promotion of national goods is urgently needed at the current time when national industries are on the verge of collapse. Municipal Government Counselor Ge Kexin said that after a long period of war, cities and villages in our country have suffered severe damage. After the victory, it is a good opportunity for industries to rise and expand. Especially since American goods are flooding the city, the establishment of the National Goods Marketplace is of great significance. After Ge's speech, the closing ceremony was completed. Starting tomorrow, the wooden structures of the marketplace will be dismantled. According to Marketplace Director Jiang Zhonghe, to fundamentally realize the promotion of national goods, it is necessary to build a permanent exhibition marketplace. After discussions with a majority of factory owners, it was decided to use the original open space. They have also contacted the landowner, who has expressed strong support. The association is actively promoting the construction of a permanent marketplace.</p>
<h3>One Thousand Several Hundred Criminals Meet Amnesty Criteria</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The city's High Court, District Court, and two Procuratorates received the National Government Gazette containing the amnesty decree yesterday morning. The content is the same as that published on the front page of this newspaper on New Year's Day. Because the city's courts have not yet received the official amnesty order, only seeing it in the newspapers, it cannot have legal effect. Therefore, the amnesty prisoners released by the District Court previously were only released on bail. From today onwards, the High Court and District Court will officially begin to pardon those convicted of crimes committed before December 31, 1946, with a maximum sentence of imprisonment of less than a fixed-term prison sentence. As for the reduction of sentences, it will have to wait until the detailed amnesty regulations are received before it can be processed. It is also learned that the High Court has investigated and found that over seven hundred criminals meet the amnesty criteria, and the District Court has found eight hundred and sixty. According to the person in charge of the High Court, the names will be officially announced after the detailed regulations for sentence reduction are issued.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Shanghai Prison has been working overtime in recent days to compile a list of prisoners to be submitted to the Ministry of Justice for a decision on amnesty or sentence reduction. This list is expected to be completed tonight. Because each prisoner's indictment and judgment must be checked in detail, the procedure is extremely complicated. It is reported that after the prisoners are released, their prison uniforms must be taken off and returned. If impoverished prisoners have no clothes to keep warm, a certain relief committee has donated four hundred sets of cotton clothing to the prison (three hundred sets of men's clothing and one hundred sets of women's clothing), which the prison has already received. A lawyer named Chen has also notified the prison that he has raised four hundred sets of winter clothing to be donated to the prison, but they have not yet been delivered. This winter clothing can truly be said to be like sending charcoal in the snow for impoverished prisoners.</p>

<h3>中國農民銀行委製 平水區珠茶 每擔成本廿三萬元</h3>
<p>Chinese Farmers Bank Commissions Production of Ping Shui Green Tea: Cost Per Dan Not to Exceed 230,000 Yuan</p>
<p>平水區珠茶向以銷北菲最多，卅五年度首批出產約三萬餘擔，因品質特優，戰後該地消費力減低，故雖有外商定購然出價甚低，是以甚少出口，中國農民銀行有豐於此，特商洽上海市茶業輪出業同業公會代製二批次級平水珠茶一萬二千擔，並規定成本價格最高每擔不得超過國幣廿三萬元，限兩個月內全部交貨，開該會已委託興華，久與之滬地最大兩茶業公司承製。並悉此批茶葉將與即將在滬收購之外銷茶由政府統舉輪出。</p>
<p>Ping Shui green tea has traditionally been mostly sold to North Africa. The first batch produced in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) was about 30,000 dan. Due to its excellent quality, the purchasing power in that region has decreased after the war. Therefore, although there were foreign merchants placing orders, their prices were very low, resulting in very little export. The Chinese Farmers Bank, with surplus funds, specifically consulted with the Shanghai Tea Export Traders Association to produce two batches of 12,000 dan of second-grade Ping Shui green tea on its behalf. It was stipulated that the cost price should not exceed 230,000 yuan per dan, and all goods must be delivered within two months. The association has entrusted Xinghua and Jiu Yu, the two largest tea companies in Shanghai, to undertake the production. It is understood that this batch of tea, together with the export tea to be purchased in Shanghai, will be exported by the government in a unified manner.</p>
<p>中國農民銀行滬行負責人稱：該行本年度特種貸款，以茶絲　項爲主，已後就易體計劃，呈誌行審核，約二月初旬可望批准後施行，茶葉貸款之　放，爲使不失時效起見，至週於三日間核准各外銷茶商貸款數額，如去幾新茶未收購完竣，將同時並進，範圍自茶農，製造，運輸，外銷，兼及押歷，數額一五〇億元，必要時得按照實際情況，酌損增加。絲業方面，以去年度絲絲廠，原料困難，及秋　生　收購價格迄未載定，一般蠶絲界，咸以爲本年度蠶絲業振興希壞甚小，惟以生絲爲出口物品之一，該行據政府扶植外銷物品之哲憲，決統籌計劃自製種塲，桑園，蠶室用具，蠶行設衛，繅絲車改良等，希望本年內對茶絲二項外銷情況，能予改觀云。</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Farmers Bank stated: The bank's special loans for this year are mainly focused on tea and silk. The exchange plan has been submitted to the head office for review and is expected to be approved and implemented in early February. In order to ensure that tea loans are released in a timely manner, the amount of loans for each export tea merchant will be approved within three days of the week. If the acquisition of new tea from the previous season has not been completed, it will be carried out simultaneously. The scope covers tea farmers, manufacturing, transportation, export, and collateral, amounting to 15 billion yuan, and may be increased or decreased appropriately according to the actual situation if necessary. Regarding the silk industry, due to the difficulties in raw materials faced by silk factories last year and the failure to determine the purchase price of autumn silkworms, the general silk industry believes that the hope of revitalizing the silk industry this year is very small. However, given that raw silk is one of the export items, the bank, based on the government's policy of supporting export items, has decided to plan comprehensively for the self-production of seed fields, mulberry gardens, silkworm room equipment, the establishment of sanitary facilities for silkworm farms, and the improvement of silk reeling machines, hoping to change the export situation of tea and silk this year.</p>

<h3>外埠紗廠請購外棉 亦依新辦法辦理</h3>
<p>Outport Yarn Mills Request to Purchase Foreign Cotton: Also Handled According to New Methods</p>
<p>關於外埠紗廠請購外棉問題，前紡管會議決，根據收購棉紗新辦法，對原棉之供給，均照該項辦法辦理，曾分飭各區紡織公會轉知各紗廠查報現有存棉，及今後需要外棉數量，俾資統計。惟各外埠紗廠，迄未報到，有時進行。茲以各區路途較遠，辦理轉輾需時，若不寬限期間，則事實上或不克趕辦，業再分電各區紡織公會迅即查報。又據該會劉業務處長稱：外埠紗廠請購外棉，如不將該項需要數量塡報到　則本會無從統計，以後如有需要，手續上極感困難，故希望各地紗廠切勿自行放棄。</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of outport yarn mills requesting to purchase foreign cotton, the previous Spinning Management Conference decided that the supply of raw cotton should be handled in accordance with the new method of purchasing cotton yarn. The textile associations in each district were instructed to inform each yarn mill to check and report the existing cotton inventory and the amount of foreign cotton needed in the future for statistical purposes. However, the outport yarn mills have not yet reported, and progress is sometimes made. Because the distances to each district are relatively far, and it takes time to handle the transfers, if the period is not extended, it may not be possible to complete the work in time. A separate telegram has been sent to the textile associations in each district to quickly check and report. Furthermore, according to the association's business director, Liu: If outport yarn mills do not fill in and report the required quantity, the association will have no way to collect statistics, and if there is a need in the future, the procedures will be extremely difficult. Therefore, it is hoped that yarn mills in various places will not give up on their own.</p>

It was originally scheduled to be sold simultaneously in more than 60 coal shops in the urban area yesterday, but due to incomplete procedures, it was decided to publicly sell them at a fair price starting at 9:00 AM today, at 11,000 yuan per dan, based on household registration certificates, and will end at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Due to the excessive cost of raw silk exports in China in recent years, exports have become increasingly difficult, and silk reeling manufacturers are on the verge of bankruptcy. The silk reeling manufacturers originally had no intention of purchasing, but after the authorities allowed loans for purchasing, the cost of silk reeling exceeded the government's purchase price of raw silk by more than one time. They have repeatedly appealed to the central government, requesting to adjust the purchase price according to the cost of raw silk, and have contacted the Central Bank authorities several times. So far, it has been delayed for two months and has not been resolved. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, silk factories cannot allow further delays. A few days ago, Wang Huanan and Shen Jiuru, managing directors of the Silk Industry Association, went to the Central Bank to meet with President Bei to discuss the matter, but the results were not satisfactory. The Silk Industry Association specifically held a meeting of managing directors yesterday to discuss countermeasures. During the meeting, it was decided to send a letter to President Bei of the Central Bank in the name of the Silk Industry Association, making an urgent appeal, hoping that the bank would order the China Silkworm Company to immediately review and handle the matter within two days. The association also scheduled a general meeting of all members this afternoon to jointly resolve the crisis of the industry. If the Central Bank cannot decide on the purchase price, the association will further request 3 million yuan per dan of raw silk to alleviate the urgent needs of the New Year. If it is not approved again, the factories will have to close down and await death, and the consequences will be borne by the government. The association's letter to President Bei is recorded below:</p>
<p>逕啓者，需政府准予按照秋期生絲成本收購並酌給利潤，以免整個繅絲業崩潰一案，前經敝會分呈院部迅予核辦並於卅五年十二月初，推派代表晉京請求，業於十二月中旬奉行政院宋院長批交台端核議，關於秋期生絲成本，復經政府機構之中蠶公司，據實調查送請察核各在案，敝會迭向貴行接洽，一再延諉，置敝會會員各廠痛苦於不顧，茲屆廢歷年關整個絲業存亡迫眉睫，台端對於本案旣負核議之責任，自應趕速遵辦，何以遲遲視若無賭，陷敝會失信於會員，各廠深爲駭異，爲此函請爺遵宋院長交核之旨，迅於二日內照中蠶公司查覆辦理，以便轉達各會員，萬一拖延，各會員不能維持而發生嚴重後果，咎將誰竭，專此奉陳，務祈立購惠覆，此致中央銀行貝總裁。</p>
<p>Respectfully, regarding the case where the government needs to approve the purchase of autumn raw silk at cost and provide a reasonable profit to avoid the collapse of the entire silk reeling industry, our association previously submitted it to the Yuan Department for swift review and handling, and in early December of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), representatives were dispatched to Beijing to request it. In mid-December, President Song of the Executive Yuan approved it and handed it over to you for review. Regarding the cost of autumn raw silk, the China Silkworm Company, a government agency, conducted a factual investigation and submitted it for review. Our association has repeatedly contacted your bank, but it has been repeatedly delayed, ignoring the suffering of our association's member factories. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the survival of the entire silk industry is imminent. Since you are responsible for reviewing this case, you should expedite its handling. Why do you delay it as if it were nothing, causing our association to lose credibility with its members and causing deep consternation among the factories? Therefore, we hereby request you to comply with President Song's instructions and handle the matter according to the China Silkworm Company's investigation and reply within two days so that it can be conveyed to all members. In the event of further delays, if members cannot maintain operations and serious consequences occur, who will bear the blame? We respectfully submit this and urge you to reply promptly. Respectfully to President Bei of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>僑匯逃避 多經民信局</h3>
<p>Remittance Evasion Mostly Through Private Postal Agencies</p>
<p>頃據金融思權威方面告稱：關於上年度大量僑匯之逃避，其　結所在，當係外匯牌價具黑市相差縣殊，但是項逃避僑匯，亦非如外傳之甚，均落在當地錢兌莊手中，實則多半爲當地民信局所包攬。因民信局之歷史較郵局悠久，我國在明末清初之時，已有局信局之設立，故延至目前，仍握有相當勢力，且頗得各地僑胞之信賴。最近復據中行方面統計，上年十二月份該行收入僑匯，其數字又較十一月份减少，故今後對民信局之承兌寄遞僑匯，確值得注意之。</p>
<p>According to financial authorities: Regarding the large-scale evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese last year, the crux of the matter lies in the significant difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate. However, the evasion of remittances is not as widespread as rumored, and it does not all fall into the hands of local money exchange shops. In fact, most of it is handled by local private postal agencies. Because the history of private postal agencies is longer than that of the post office, private postal agencies were established in China during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Therefore, they still hold considerable power to this day and are quite trusted by overseas Chinese in various places. According to recent statistics from the Bank of China, the bank's income from remittances in December of last year decreased compared to November. Therefore, the acceptance and delivery of remittances by private postal agencies in the future is indeed worth paying attention to.</p>

<p>The Taiwan Navigation Company, sponsored by the Taiwan Provincial Government, has been officially established with a total capital of 10 billion yuan, of which 60% is from the Taiwan Provincial Government and 40% is from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Xu Xueyu is the chairman, and Ren Xianzhe, director of the Department of Transportation of the Taiwan Provincial Government, is the general manager. The company already has the "Taipei" and "Tainan" vessels, which operate regularly, and it has now decided to open regular routes from Shanghai to Taiwan, Taiwan to Guangzhou, and Taiwan to Qingdao. The smooth flow of the Shanghai-Taiwan route is of great benefit to the supply of coal and rice in this city. Currently, the amount of coal shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai reaches 60,000 tons per month. If transportation is smooth, the amount of Taiwan coal shipped to Shanghai can continue to increase.</p>

<p>Recently, the number of live pigs from Jiangbei arriving in Shanghai has decreased slightly. As it is the end of the Lunar year, the sales of fresh meat in the city are particularly brisk, resulting in prices rising daily. Yesterday, the wholesale price of fresh meat was 340,000 to 360,000 yuan per dan. Fresh meat shops retailed leg meat for 4,700 to 4,800 yuan per catty, lean meat for 4,000 yuan, and ribs for 3,800 yuan. However, the price of fresh meat transported from the suburbs and Suzhou-Wuxi to Shanghai was slightly cheaper, at 3,500 yuan to 4,000 yuan per catty.</p>

<p>Xu Boguo, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, came to Shanghai from Beijing last week to promote the work of the Provisional Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans, investigate the current status of various production agencies, and examine the actual use of their funds. It is learned that Mr. Xu has completed his official duties and returned to Beijing yesterday morning. The reporter, in view of the fact that various factories believe that the committee is a temporary organization and that the end of its term is not expected to extend beyond the end of the Lunar year, specifically raised the above question to him before his departure and received the following answer from Mr. Xu: The committee will continue to advance until the review of all loan applications is completed. It is estimated that it will take at least another month before it can be temporarily concluded. Even if all cases have been processed in the future, the work of the committee will not be fully concluded, because at that time, based on the committee's loan principles, personnel will be regularly sent directly to various factories to investigate the use of funds and production status.</p>

<h3>Arctic Expedition Account Jianhua</h3>
<p>The British Arctic expedition departed not long ago, and the American Antarctic expedition continues to depart, now en route, and will surely have new records in the future. This is the report from the British Venus Expedition, newly returned from the Arctic, by its leader Morse Bick.</p>
<p>Standing Icebergs</p>
<p>On August 8, 1946, we set off, and it has been three weeks now. Today, we are passing through the Katanga River in the Arctic Ocean. Along the way, icebergs stand tall, their shimmering light very eye-catching. There are cold-resistant waterfowl along the coast, flying in flocks, like snowflakes dancing in the sky. Our three major warships are heading towards Jianhu Island. From upstream, ice floes sometimes rush down. If there were no remote ice flow instruments, the ship's hull might have been damaged. The ship traveled for three days and nights before reaching Blue Fox Island, where the strong winds roared and the climate felt even colder. This is the old destination for whaling, but when we arrived, there were no whaling vessels, nor did we see any national flags.</p>
<p>When leaving Blue Fox Island and heading north, the ocean surface was often shrouded in thick fog. Although we were full of courage, we inevitably felt apprehensive in the vast and foggy ocean. We concentrated our minds at home to avoid danger. One day, the thick fog suddenly dissipated, and we saw a black dot in the distance. We cheered and advanced as if we had discovered a new continent. As we approached the black dot, it turned out to be an unnamed small island. A group of walruses were tumbling in the waves. We tried to land and erected a prefabricated iron road sign on the island, which read "British Venus Expedition Discovered Native Land."</p>
<p>A Scene of Barrenness</p>
<p>Consel Island, traditionally said to be a gold-producing area, has a total area of ​​more than 2,000 square miles, with a vast land and no people, and a scene of utter barrenness. After we arrived, we set up tents on the island. Because the cold air was overwhelming, we took turns warming ourselves by the fire, and divided into five small teams to explore the mountains. Team member Wilkes found a huge piece of native gold, and Greaves also found a piece. The total amount obtained by the two people reached four kilos and sixty grams. Other team members only knew that the island produced foxes and found nothing else. However, since there is native gold, large-scale mining will surely yield good results. October 19th was my birthday. We were drinking and having fun when we suddenly heard gunfire. The team members cheered with joy because we had received a wireless report that the second Venus expedition had also caught up.</p>
<p>The second team had five warships, which, together with our three, totaled eight. After we erected the Venus team road sign on the island, we left Consel Island and continued north. Now our momentum is strong, and we have gained a lot of courage. After five days at sea, the Lantek ship was damaged by an ice flow. Fortunately, there were fifteen large pieces of wood tied to the port side, otherwise, it might have suffered great danger. One day, we arrived at Viti Levu Island, which is composed of more than two hundred and fifty small islands, with an area of ​​7,434 square miles. The largest of these is Viti Levu Island. We decided to land, but the mountains were covered with ice and snow, and there were no roads to follow. The cold wind was biting, and there was a possibility of fingers and skin cracking. As we passed through a deep valley, the team members suddenly saw tents at the bottom of the valley and exclaimed in surprise. At this time, everyone's attitude was frenzied, and their blood was boiling. They ran to the bottom of the valley and saw only a large, broken airplane, not tents. Inside and outside the airplane, fifteen incomplete skeletons were found, with white bones scattered all over the ground, a scene like a terrifying demon cave. We recalled the TASS report of the missing plane, which may have been this one. In addition to expressing our pity and sympathy, we also admired their ambition. So we collected the wreckage, dug a pit and buried it, and added a cross.</p>
<p>Nothing Gained</p>
<p>This unfortunate incident increased our determination to move forward. However, less than five days of northward progress made it impossible for us to advance further because the future was full of ice floes and ice blocks, with no gaps to walk. We fired more than two hundred shots, but could not blast open a passage, and each ship was covered with a layer of ice, which made it difficult for us to move and left us helpless. Now, although we still have half a year's worth of food, staying in the Arctic Ocean is definitely not a good idea, so since we cannot advance, we can only retreat quickly. When the eight ships entered Devonport, they were welcomed by tens of thousands of people, but we asked ourselves and felt ashamed that we had gained nothing from this trip!

<h3>Early Tea President's Background良translated from this month's issue of ")"</h3>
<p>If you have the ambition to become president, it is best to study law. In the United States, of the thirty-two men who have attained the high office of president, nineteen were quite active in the legal profession before entering the political arena. Five were farmers, two were soldiers, and the remaining six included a tailor, a writer, an educator, an editor, an engineer, and a cloth retailer.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cross-Section Beggars Welcoming Spring (Part 1) Huang Ximo</h3>
<p>During the twenty days at the end of the lunar year and the new year, it is the auspicious time for beggars. Beggars are the garbage left over from feudal traditions. They are hereditary followers of agriculture. During this period, every household is preparing for the New Year, and no one wants to get angry with beggars, lest it causes inauspicious scolding. So they have no choice but to give alms, giving alms without hesitation. The beggars also speculatively sing and play various songs suitable for the market to win the favor of the almsgivers and create a festive atmosphere around them. The begging patterns and lyrics in this season are completely different from usual. Because they can only use it once a year, this phenomenon can be seen in this city.</p>
<h3>Dropping the Kitchen God</h3>
<p>On the day of sending off the Kitchen God at the end of the lunar month, there is a kind of "Dropping the Kitchen God" song, which is the exclusive performance of female beggars. Therefore, all the women and girls of the beggar households are dispatched in full force. They dress up in an extremely flirtatious manner, with their faces covered with red rouge and white powder, and their heads adorned with palace flowers. They go from house to house singing ditties. Behind them is an old beggar, holding a small gong in his hand, striking it at the door. Then the girls sing in a delicate voice:</p>
<p>"Plum blossoms bloom in the snow, peach blossoms wait for spring!</p>
<p>Kitchen God arrives, the family is good.</p>
<p>Where does the Kitchen God come from? The Kitchen God comes from heaven;</p>
<p>The Kitchen God drops once, the family is better once!</p>
<p>If a family doesn't drop, the Kitchen God will be annoyed."</p>
<h3>Happy New Year</h3>
<p>From the first to the tenth day of the New Year, the northern beggars, whenever they arrive at someone's door, must not shout "Master and Madam" as usual, but must first recite a set of auspicious songs, conveying the meaning of "New Year's fortune". The lyrics are as follows:</p>
<p>"New Year, new moon, passing the New Year, red couplets pasted all over the door,</p>
<p>Large ingots are carried in.</p>
<p>Money tree comes in through the front door,</p>
<p>Treasure pot comes in through the back door.</p>
<p>Treasure pot, with golden flowers inserted,</p>
<p>Wealth and glory come to one family."</p>
<p>After reciting the song, they then shout:</p>
<p>"Master and Madam, Happy New Year to you! Give me something to eat."</p>
<h3>Pretending to Be a Turtle</h3>
<p>During the New Year period, the local beggars often dress up as turtles and beg at the door, in small groups of two, one tall and one young, each wearing a straw hat, with glasses drawn around their eyes, making them look funny. The chorus lyrics are as follows:</p>
<p>"Turtles on the street, business is booming.</p>
<p>Incense stick nose, pepper eyes,</p>
<p>Awl town tail, olive head.</p>
<p>Little turtle, croaking: "Squeak, squeak, squeak"!</p>
<p>Big turtle, croaking: "Ka, ka, ka"!</p>
<p>Squeak, ka, ka, really noisy,</p>
<p>Let me beg for some copper coins to buy medicine,</p>
<p>Medicine kills turtles, don't come begging."</p>
<h3>Different Now and Then Huang Jieqing</h3>
<h3>New Year's Day in Ancient Countries</h3>
<p>In ancient times, the Greek New Year's Day was in June according to the Gregorian calendar; the Macedonian New Year's Day was in September; the Roman Empire's New Year's Day was first in March, and then changed to January 3rd; Mexico designated February 13th as New Year's Day; the Muslim New Year's Day was in July; the New Year's Day of Holland, Arabia, and other countries was December 28th.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes Fifty Years Ago Old Shanghainese Celebrating Lunar New Year Jinxia</h3>
<p>Fifty years ago, during the New Year festivals, Shanghai gentry and merchants mostly used plum red or magenta business cards, which were twice the size of the current cards. The name was written on the front, and the store name was printed on the back, and they were delivered to relatives and friends to wish them a Happy New Year.</p>
<p>When offering New Year's greetings, it was customary to kneel and bow to elders, and bow with hands clasped to peers. Therefore, people who offered New Year's greetings hired accompanying servants, who carried felt mats with them. Before kneeling and bowing, the servant would first spread the felt on the ground.</p>
<p>At that time, women who went out to pay New Year's visits, married women mostly wore red skirts and capes; unmarried women wore only red skirts.</p>
<p>At that time, the Spring Festival couplets, in addition to businesses embedding the names of their stores, ordinary households mostly used sentences such as "The Emperor's grace is vast, and the imperial way is long" and "National grace and family celebration, people's longevity and abundant years." It was not until the establishment of the Republic of China and the abolition of the imperial system that they changed.</p>
<h3>Good Medicine for Reversing Aging Stream Translation</h3>
<p>Scientists' research on bull hormones has proven that testosterone has the effect of reducing age by at least ten years. People who use testosterone can restore their sexual vitality and work ability from weak to strong. Clinical experience of doctors has proven that testosterone has significant effects in treating breast cancer, postpartum bleeding, angina pectoris, and muscle atrophy.</p>
<p>However, to obtain good results, testosterone must be used continuously or in large quantities, and testosterone is not easy to obtain and sells for US$100 per cubic centimeter, so only the wealthy can afford to buy it.</p>
<p>Now, amazing news has come from Mexico: people are extracting large amounts of testosterone from "sarsaparilla" roots at a low price, only one-tenth the price of animal testosterone. Testosterone tablets of this kind are already on sale in pharmacies in Mexico and South America. The inventor, Dr. Sulmo, has lived in Mexico for twenty years and has heard local natives' superstitious legends that blood-red sarsaparilla roots have the effect of strengthening the body. Sulmo not only did not ignore this superstition, but instead devoted himself to research, and unexpectedly obtained an unexpected gain.</p>
<p>After conducting thousands of experiments on animals and humans, Sulmo proved that sarsaparilla hormones have the same properties as animal hormones. He is currently studying a more effective method of extracting hormones from sarsaparilla roots. The current extraction method is to first peel off the outer skin of the slender sarsaparilla roots, grind them into powder, and then chemically refine them into white, odorless crystals, which are combined with a saline solution similar to human secretions, and then put into small glass tubes for injection or pressed into tablets.</p>
<p>Strangely, sarsaparilla is not a "new drug." As early as the tenth century, European doctors had used sarsaparilla to treat syphilis, skin diseases, glandular diseases, and rheumatism. Even today, sarsaparilla syrup is still used as a mixture in oral medications because it can increase the absorption of other drugs by the intestinal walls.</p>
<p>Sarsaparilla grows in tropical regions, and the most abundant production is in Mexico, Central America, and the hotter regions of South America. It is mostly wild and does not require artificial cultivation. Sulmo predicts that after this plant-based testosterone is produced in large quantities in the future, people all over the world can enjoy this cheap and high-quality youth-preserving drug, just like taking vitamins or aspirin now.</p>

<h3>Remnants Still Remain Ruosi</h3>
<h3>Police Affairs</h3>
<p>In the old residence of the "Morphine King", 1,058 catties of opium were seized in one search. This number is not small. It is said that according to the "market price", it is worth 3.3 to 3.4 billion, which is even more considerable. (See this newspaper on the 14th)</p>
<p>It is said that the "Morphine King" had already fled after the case occurred during the enemy-puppet period, but the opium is still there, which can be called "the remnants still remain."</p>
<p>Moreover, opium has a "market price," which further illustrates that there is fundamentally "poison," and it is not a question of "exhausted" or "not exhausted."</p>
<p>During the enemy-puppet period, opium was publicly sold and publicly smoked without any scruples. Opium naturally had a "market value," but why is there a "market price" now? (I think it may be a reporter's typo.) If there is a "market price," of course it is a veritable "black market."</p>
<p>However, not long ago, the authorities announced a figure, saying that several provinces such as Shaanxi and Sichuan currently "still have" 600,000 opium addicts. The two words "still have" have a strong meaning of "the remnants still remain." If we calculate it, let's count a little less, ten opium addicts smoke one ounce of opium every day, and 600,000 people smoke 60,000 ounces, which is 3,000 catties per day, calculated using a 20-ounce catty, or 900 dan per month. If everyone is an "old gun," even counting 2,000 is not too much.</p>
<p>Then this number is much more poisonous than the "remnants" of the "Morphine King"! Because more than 1,000 catties is not enough to fill a truck, and 2,000 dan is enough to fill a train.</p>
<p>"The remnants still remain"? Or is the poison still rampant? Opium still has a "market price," how should it be explained?</p>
<h3>The Woman Behind the Argentine President (Part 1) Zuo Xi</h3>
<h3>A Mysterious Young Woman</h3>
<p>When Juan Perón was elected president of Argentina, most North Americans were surprised. In their minds, they believed that after years of losing freedom, Argentina, when it could vote freely, would inevitably overthrow the dictatorship. At least in theory, Argentina was an ally that promoted world fascism. As one of the United Nations, it would certainly not vote in favor of the revival of fascism.</p>
<p>But these assumptions are just a kind of ardent hope. In fact, only Long's election as president was just a technical success. In the minds of the Argentine working-class voters who hold a decisive majority, the name "Perón" naturally evokes the impression of a beautiful and moving young woman. She—Eva Perón—used her beauty and sweet words to win many votes for her husband.</p>
<h3>Power Above the President</h3>
<p>Today, the person who is most noticed is not the Argentine president, but his wife. Eva Perón occupies the highest position on the Argentine political stage, and the goal of all her activities is a more thorough revolution than that led by her husband. Eva Perón, the former Latin American opera queen and current Argentine president’s wife, can be called a unique and bizarre figure in the complex political world.</p>
<p>It is difficult to confirm from formal interviews that Eva Perón is the true authority in Argentina. On the phone, she tries her best to pretend to be Baylor's simple wife and good helper, and her words are so evasive. When reporters ask about her political activities, she replies: "Politics? No! No! I have never been interested in politics. I don't understand what politics is at all. I don't understand politics at all! The only work I care about is social welfare and relieving the poor."</p>
<p>But the fact is this: according to the Chicago Sun, Eva Perón's main job is an organized political movement. Every day, she meets many people in her headquarters in the Argentine capital's post office building to discuss government matters. She is currently organizing Argentine women to prepare to grant them the right to vote. According to informed sources, once this right is granted, the current government will obtain a huge number of votes in the 1948 general election.</p>
<p>According to Mrs. Perón herself, she is busy with social services all day long. She said: "I get up at seven o'clock every morning. I visit factories and chat casually with the workers. At lunchtime, I tell General Perón about the workers' problems. The thing I care about most is how to improve the living conditions of the poor."</p>
<h3>Associating with Politicians</h3>
<p>But journalists have noticed that among the union representatives and women's group leaders gathered in Mrs. Perón's office waiting room are mixed governors, mayors, opposition politicians, and even cabinet ministers, who are all eager to report to her. They also noted that visiting guests are screened by Ernst, a secretary of German-Argentine descent.</p>
<p>Eva Perón's relationship with the Nazis is closer than her husband's, as can be proven from many aspects. Mrs. Perón does not deny in private conversations that the Frued family are her close comrades. According to investigation reports, the US State Department's Blue Book states that Frued is Argentina's number one Nazi. His son Rudolf accompanied the Perón couple in their election campaign, paying all expenses and guiding Eva on how to win votes. After Perón's victory, the Frued family's power did not diminish. When the United States demanded that the elder Frued be expelled from Argentina, Perón appointed his son Rudolf as his "special secretary." (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Spring and Autumn Form and Content Yang Tongfang</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the form and content of art, modern aestheticians have many original ideas. Gourmont said, "It is impossible to completely separate form from substance." Our research is therefore to establish nouns, but for the convenience of exploration, such as the form and content of art, it is impossible to separate them completely. Our thoughts and emotions change rapidly, and it is absolutely not easy to grasp them, but under certain circumstances, we must also limit them so that they condense into one, become concrete things, and then can be conveyed to people, so we need a form. For example, literary works, form and content must be matched, and then the meaning of the words will be integrated, the subtleties will be conveyed, and the expressive power can reach perfection. Therefore, in order to achieve perfect expression, we cannot but pay attention to form. What people generally call method refers to this. How to frame words and phrases, how to select materials and layout, and how to put effort into diction and tone are almost all things that every successful writer must carefully consider.</p>
<p>Widchester believes that form is the sum total of methods for conveying emotions and thoughts, that is to say, conveying emotions and thoughts must rely on form. However, we must recognize that form is only a means, not an end. By using form to fully express the essence of the content, can a perfect work be completed. From this we can see the close relationship between form and content. Literary critics in ancient and modern China and abroad probably have the same view, that is, to make the form perfect, we must first enrich the content. Winchester wants writers to pay attention to the essence of the content, otherwise, they should not pay attention to the form. Zeng Disheng's "Qiu Que Zhai Diary" says: "When writing poetry and prose, there is a time when emotions are extremely sincere and must be expressed, but it is also necessary to have a rich accumulation of knowledge in ordinary times, without speculation, to be resourceful. The reason for what he said is enough to reach the most sincere and upright emotions in his heart. There is no suffering of chiseling words and carving sentences when writing, and there is no feeling of stagnation after the article is completed. All this is due to the accumulation of knowledge from reading in ordinary days." Wang Chong's theory of literature also emphasizes content, which he calls "the foundation of diction." He has a few words that are very well said: "Diction is the glory of a writer, the skin and shell. The essence is in the heart, and the text is written on bamboo and silk. Inside and outside are naturally consistent, the intention is taken and the pen is released, so the text is seen and the reality is revealed." This metaphor is very appropriate.</p>
<p>From the words of various families, content determines form, and form expresses content. If there is form without substance, then the form is merely an empty formality, like a person with bones but no flesh, still not becoming a person. If there is substance without form, it is like having materials but no structure, still not becoming a building. Therefore, content is the only condition that determines form, but on the other hand, form is also a major factor in making literary works perfect. The same kind of substance, the same kind of material, and the same kind of content can be divided into good and bad works due to the quality of expression skills. The diction of an article is like the refinement of gold and jade, and the pattern of cloth and silk. The decoration is gorgeous and the light is brilliant, which can show the magnificence of the substance and increase the reader's interest in appreciation.</p>
<p>I think everyone has more or less emotions and thoughts, but not everyone has the ability to express them, or everyone is very superior in it. Therefore, to convey what is in your heart truthfully is really not an easy task. It is indeed difficult to make both form and content beautiful, and both coincide without any regrets. Because emotions and thoughts are ethereal, uncertain, and changeable, without a fixed form, and the form and meaning of words are restricted by habits. Therefore, many writers feel the poverty of Chinese language and demand the creation of new and living vocabulary, so that the expression can be more complete and the meaning can be more accurate.</p>
<p>Liu Xie, in "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons," says: "When one picks up the pen, the spirit is twice as strong as the words. But when the article is completed, half the heart begins to fold. Why? Because the intention turns empty and is easy to be strange, and the text is subtle and real and difficult to be ingenious." Writers may not be able to understand with their hands what they can understand in their hearts, so they often feel the pain that the intention does not match the object and the text does not express the meaning. What we have always said about "eyes high, hands low" also contains this meaning. Some people, even if they can't think of it in their hearts, but when they see other people's works, they will be touched and moved. At this time, they have already realized other people's thoughts, but they can criticize and judge other people's works, but they may not be able to write it themselves.</p>
<p>Writers must be able to handle the thoughts they want to express with ease, and the text should be as intended. Whether writing about characters or recording events, or explaining principles, they must be just right. They must study writing skills carefully and have a thorough cultivation in expression methods. Generally speaking, the communication of thoughts is easier than emotions. If literature only publishes pure thoughts, then ordinary language can barely be enough, but when it comes to expressing emotions, it must be done with the help of perfect form. Usually, the rhetorical techniques required for articles that record events and analyze principles are by no means as difficult as those for lyrical poetry. It is also the same for readers. It is more difficult to grasp the true meaning of poetry in order to achieve the true purpose of appreciation than other words.</p>
<p>If we want to create excellent literary works, we must consider the form, but the prerequisite seems to be the essence of the content, because the form is attached to the essence. To be sincere is the creed we should have in writing. Zhang Xuecheng said, "Words are valued for knowledge, not for decoration," which is correct.</p>
<p>Form and content are equally important for composing a literary work. We do not have to argue whether form determines essence or essence determines form. A good work should be the product of form and essence multiplied, and their mutual influence on the quality of the work is obvious. Therefore, unless thoughts, emotions, and language condense together and become a chemical compound, and then written, there can be no perfect work. Mr. Zhu Guangjie said, "Thought is the entity, and language is the projection," which is the best explanation of form and content.</p>
<h3>Poems Talk Fragmentarily Lin Feng</h3>
<p>Poetry is our closest companion. We complain to it, beg it for help, question it, shout to it… In the poorest days, it never leaves us, and its most superior quality is that it always gives us endless spiritual comfort, never divides a little of anything with us, even a single unit of heat. On the contrary, sometimes it will increase our body temperature.</p>
<h3>Landscape Zingg [French Modern Painting]</h3>
<h3>Suppression Zang Zan</h3>
<p>It has been many years since I saw heavy snow. These days I have been wandering in foreign lands, like a vagrant, like a mountain monk with a shaved head knocking on a wooden fish, everywhere is home, everywhere looking for the alms of warmth. But it is always lonely.</p>
<p>Now I have returned home and am looking at the heavy snow that I haven't seen for many years:</p>
<p>The snow is flying like reed catkins, filling the sky, covering the earth layer by layer, the earth is blindingly white, lonely white. When loneliness is full, a group of happy children rush out from all corners, raising a piece of life-filled shouting, and immediately start a snowball fight and build a snowman. The annual joy caused by the cold unfolds on the white snow; the snow is filled with footprints—some human and some dog.</p>
<p>The snow keeps falling, accumulating its cold white light. This white snow penetrates into my chest and accumulates in my heart. I always want to dissolve this cold, but I can't resist this constantly gushing cold; my heart almost loses its normal beating, as pale as snow. This heart beating out of rhythm does not fail to want to jump with the joy of the children, but it always jumps so staggeringly, like a heart patient, my heart has suffered a stubborn wound.</p>
<p>I also had a childhood. I also had enough enthusiasm and innocence to splash and waste at will in the ice and snow. I don't believe in cold, I believe in heat, I believe that more cold can produce more heat. So I resolutely set off with this enthusiasm and confidence. I will travel all over this icy and snowy world, like the prospectors in Alaska, chasing their hopes. My heart is white and shining, like the lights of the miners. I will hold it high above my head, hoping to see the same proof of light. Full of hope, crossing one valley after another, one village after another…</p>
<p>But how desolate the wilderness is! I search for stars through the dark clouds, but what I touch is only silence, a sea-like silence. I can't hear a greeting, I can't shout out an echo.</p>
<p>Finally, I limped back to my hometown raggedly and empty-handed. That heart that had been unattached for ten years, holding that last hope, but the fields of my hometown were barren. My hometown was as strange as another country, or even more hateful… My hope almost turned into despair, and the ideal I held above my head almost died out.</p>
<p>One winter passes and another winter passes. I have gained nothing, but I have only learned to suppress the enthusiasm in my heart—it has been wasted too much.</p>
<h3>Green Leaf Wind</h3>
<p>Green is a symbol of life.</p>
<p>Plants absorb sunlight to produce chlorophyll, giving life eternal continuity and development, so the branches are lush, the flowers are in full bloom, and nature sets off a shade of lush greenery.</p>
<p>The feeling that green gives people is kind.</p>
<p>Where there is green, life is jumping and abundant, vigorous and solid.</p>
<p>When we lie in the spring's edge of green, how open our hearts will feel, it will often bring us a lofty buried thought and a noble belief:</p>
<p>Life is endless work and battle!</p>
<h3>Lament for the Orphaned Girl Xi Xi</h3>
<p>In Beihai Park, Beijing, there is a place called Lancui Xuan, located at the highest point of the so-called Qiong Island. Following the stone steps upwards, you suddenly see a flat surface, looking down at the imperial city, with layers of yellow tiles reflecting in the green trees. The Jin’ao Yuyong Bridge is like a belt. The passing soldiers and horses are just like groups of ants, but they look clearly countable. Leaning on the railing and looking at the mountains in the northwest, the sunlight shines on them, showing different degrees of light and darkness, each presenting a different appearance. Thinking about it, being in the city and being able to see beyond thirty or forty miles away cannot be said to be a spectacle, and moreover, climbing does not require much effort, and there is also the glory of rattan chairs and clear tea. This time I remember it was just after the snow, the green cypress and pine were covered with white powder, the distant mountains were wearing residual snow, especially setting off the azure sky, the air was so clear, I only heard the sound of foraging sparrows, breaking the silence, I then leisurely cherish the constraints of all things in life, which are never relaxed in the ruthless years. Although winter is a state of stillness, who knows that it is hiding the struggling hearts?</p>
<p>Several female students with accents from other places at the tea seat next door also seemed to be echoing each other, sighing at the scenery. One of them looked at me several times, and suddenly, when I was not paying attention, walked over to my side and very respectfully said to me: "When Mr. Guang Sheng gave a lecture at the ×× training center, do you still remember me, this student?"</p>
<p>I was stunned and could not answer.</p>
<p>She continued to tell me euphemistically: She was a poor woman from a certain city in eastern Beijing. She had finally managed to graduate from university, and she had thought that she could rely on her own ability to find a job to support her old mother. Who knew that the career in her hometown had always been controlled by a group of advanced people from the hometown. The newly emerged people always said that they were not qualified enough. Even if they reluctantly embarrassed people and did not object, they would always set the salary extremely low, making it really impossible for people to continue working. As a result, they said that young people were not qualified and only knew how to take money. She saw through this trick and knew that a weak woman was not worthy of fighting with them. So she swallowed her anger and did a little work. After that, she wanted to take the opportunity of being recommended to this "certain training center" to get a qualification and find a place to stay in a big city.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I interjected and said: "I remember that the major you studied has a relatively narrow outlet, is it easy to find a job in Beijing?"</p>
<p>She also told me that what she studied had nothing to do with the difficulty of finding a job. Anyway, finding a job requires connections. Where is there really choosing people for the job? My difficulty is not in this, but in the fact that people嫌弃 my accent from other places is too strong, and they feel that I am not one of their group. The ridicule and cold looks I have received are also difficult to describe. I also know that Heaven will not arrange a satisfactory environment for me, so I try my best to tolerate it, and I try my best to be the same as everyone else to avoid being isolated. I accommodate everything and seek immediate peace; but with my meager income, I have to re-dress myself completely to cater to the ears and eyes of the times, and I am afraid that my old mother will have to endure more hunger and cold. The sad expression in her words made it unbearable to look up at her. I had no choice but to try my best to think of a few words of comfort and promised to pay attention to her and find a way to help her, which added another layer of melancholy in this bleak and declining year.</p>
<p>After some time, I was strolling in the market when I suddenly met her walking towards me. She seemed very flustered and said: "Mr. Guang Sheng, can you lend me a place for ten minutes of conversation?" I nodded and walked into a small restaurant with her. After she sat down, the first thing she said was: "I am already a motherless person." I said: "No wonder you are sad, but this pain in life is unavoidable. Is there anything you need me to help you with?" She then sobbed and told me: "Their ancestors were originally a noble family in a certain city. Because of an unfortunate accident in the family, her mother only had three dilapidated houses left, and she and her sisters lived a lonely life for more than twenty years. Unfortunately, her sister died when she was about to become an adult. Since she went to school and even worked, there were really few days with her mother, and her mother hoped that she would become famous and establish a family to support her for the rest of her life for more than twenty years. In her old age, her fantasy became more and more intense, but she was getting further and further away from the facts. Apart from bringing a little delicious food to comfort her old mother during the holidays, she never made her smile happily for a day; throughout the year, her mother looked forward to her daughter's return, and her daughter missed her mother but could not return. The contradiction of human affairs has exhausted the limited flesh and blood. The suffering of life is endless, where to complain in the vast world? She wanted to erect a monument in front of her mother’s grave, venting all her suppressed emotions, or gaining a tear of sympathy from those who had the same experience."</p>
<p>I said: "You might as well write it out yourself, I can revise it for you."</p>
<p>A few days later, she indeed sent a manuscript. The love between the mother and daughter described in it was so sincere and moving, and the situation was so real that I felt I couldn't change a single word, so I wrote it for her. I think there is probably still this mournful tombstone in the public cemetery of a certain city. Whenever the weather is cold and it is about to snow, I always think of her sad tone.</p>

<p>"Fear of urgently correcting," He Jian heard someone shouting like this, and he also agreed like this. As he agreed, he had already discovered that behind Konoe's low bed, someone was standing, and looking at it in the shadows, it really looked like "half a pagoda."</p>
<p>"[He Jian Wang, according to the head's order, fear of urgently correcting..." He Jian explained his intention according to the way of the society.</p>
<p>"The allies are all outside," the character who "hmph" said, "those who want to fulfill their duties, jump out of this window!" Bushido's words have always been in this kind of tone of eating raw rice.</p>
<p>Isn't there a big screen behind that low bed? There are several large windows behind that screen. He Jian, after being led by him, ran behind the screen; looking at it, the lattice windows were all closed. Opening the Yu lattice, there was another layer of glass lattice outside. As soon as the glass lattice was opened, he immediately heard the clanging sound of knives, mixed with the shouting of fighting.</p>
<p>As soon as He Jian jumped down from the window, he heard a bang, which was the sound of a very small pistol firing. With a chi sound, the bullet passed over his head.</p>
<p>He Jian did not pay attention to this, so he did not have time to lean over to avoid it. He understood in his heart that this was just a "greeting" expression, because the characters that appear on this kind of scene either do not carry a pistol, but if they do carry a gun, they must be a master who never misses a shot. How could they let the bullet pass over someone's head! "Greeting" is also a warning; to let the visitor understand in his heart whether he is an enemy or a friend, and quickly make a clear expression. However, sometimes it is oneself, fearing that the visitor does not know the danger of the scene, and shoots him a shot in advance to let him know.</p>
<p>As soon as He Jian heard the bullet fly over, he immediately shouted "Fear of urgently correcting"! Expressing his</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Laryngeal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Liu Yisheng asks: I am 46 years old, male. I suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis and had air injections for half a year. Later, I stopped due to pleurisy and rested at home. Recently, I have been suffering from a sore throat (slight redness and swelling of the larynx, pain when swallowing in the afternoon, and a slightly hoarse voice, with bacterial evidence), and the otolaryngologist said it is laryngeal tuberculosis. I would like to ask: (1) Because I have had pleurisy, the pleura and rib pleura are adhered and cannot be injected with air again. Are there any other ways to treat pulmonary tuberculosis? (2) How should laryngeal tuberculosis be treated? (3) I plan to be hospitalized for treatment. Which hospital has better equipment?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) Nerve resection and rib resection can be performed. Please consult a pulmonary surgery specialist. (2) Consult a specialized otolaryngologist. (3) Ruishijiusi of the Red Cross Society on Haige Road, Gongji Hospital, and various municipal hospitals may offer reduced fees for treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Persistent Asthma</p>
<p>Shen Dimin asks: I am 21 years old and have had a cough since childhood. I developed asthma due to a cold in the autumn of my thirteenth year, and it has recurred intermittently since then. Because I live in a rural town, it is inconvenient to see a doctor, so I have not been treated. Now, eight years later, I have several questions to ask: (1) Is it a lung disease? What are the harms to the body? (2) Are there any special effective medicines, and other nutritional methods? (3) Can this disease be cured?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) What you described is bronchial asthma, not pulmonary tuberculosis. Frequent attacks can affect the circulatory system. (2) Ephedrine and adrenaline are particularly effective, or go to another place for treatment. (3) It is very difficult to cure.</p>
<h3>Seventh Approval of the Qingxia Relief Fund for Ten People (Part 1) Han Describes His Solitude, Poverty, and Suffering, Every Word a Tear, Too Painful to Read</h3>
<p>Nineteen people applied for the seventh round of the Qingxia Relief Fund for the Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick.

I wonder if your newspaper can provide relief to alleviate my urgent need.</p>

<h3>President Song Convenes Relevant People to Discuss Export Promotion Strategies to Promote Exports and Earn Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the government promulgated the revised Interim Measures for Import and Export Trade on November 19 last year, a comprehensive licensing system has been adopted for imports. A temporary import management committee was established under the Supreme Economic Council to be responsible for handling import licensing matters. In order to cooperate with the above-mentioned import licensing policy, the government has decided to establish an export promotion committee under the Supreme Economic Council to promote export trade. All the details have been reported in this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on January 8. It is now learned that President Song of the Executive Yuan specially convened Bei Zuyi, Liu Gongyun, Qin Fen, Shu Zhen, Lin Fengbao, Yang Xiren, and Central Bank advisors Rogers and Mike at the Executive Yuan office in the Bank of China Building on the Bund at 11:00 AM yesterday. Song first expressed the government's decision to promote export trade, and then sought the opinions of all the people present. The meeting ended at 12:30 PM. It is understood that the focus of yesterday's meeting was to study how to promote the export of general commodities under conditions that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Raw silk, tea, tung oil, hog bristles, and eggs occupy an important position in my country's export commodities. However, the future promotion plan will also encourage other exportable commodities, so as to earn foreign exchange resources for the country and seek to balance my country's international balance of payments. It is heard that the Export Promotion Committee will be chaired by President Song, and Wang Wuwu, Yu Hongjun, Yu Dawei, Zhou Yichun, Bei Zuyi, and Qian Changzhao will serve as members. An executive committee will also be set up under the committee. It is rumored that the chairman will be Bei Zuyi, and other executive committee members include Liu Gongyun and Chen Changtong. Detailed information will be officially announced in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Just Stabilized, Then Driven Up by Rumors Again</h3>
<p>The price of gold remained stable yesterday. It opened at 3.69 million in the morning, then hovered around 3.7 million. After the high price of 3.71 million, it continued to be pressured down, and soon fell back to 3.68 million before stabilizing. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 207 gold bars at a price of 3.7 million. The supply of gold bars gradually stabilized, but there were not many transactions, and it once rose to 3.72 million, but it was difficult to sustain. At noon, it fell back to around 3.69 million again. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly arose about the issuance of large Central Bank gold notes, and same-day delivery once soared to 3.78 million. The price fell back after the Central Bank supplied 1,000 gold bars. As a result, it closed up 25,000 compared to the previous day. Gold ornaments were listed at 394,000. Silver dollars were stable, and the black market money market was tight, with interest rates remaining at around 15%.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market remained mediocre yesterday, with even fewer transactions. The black market price of US dollars hovered between 6,500 yuan and 6,600 yuan. In the afternoon, stimulated by the large denomination notes, the gold market rose, and the foreign exchange market rose slightly as a result. As a result, it closed up 150 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars remained unchanged, and there were no gains or losses. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 1,240 yuan, with a slight turnover. The Indian exchange rate was 1,490 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,500 yuan, both with little demand and a market without transactions.</p>
<h3>Securities Firms Absorb, Government Bonds Close Up</h3>
<p>The government bond market became gradually uncertain yesterday. Large securities firms suddenly came to favor it, and the market became profitable near the close. After the close, prices were shouted even higher. The Tongbing bond opened at 2,100 yuan in the morning with demand. Rooms 550 and 604 had sales. It fell to around 1,900 yuan. Rooms 552 and 503 made purchases, and it continued to rise to around 2,300 yuan. Before the close, it had fallen back to 2,150 yuan. Afterwards, with large securities firms intending to absorb, it rose again after the close. As a result, A and B bonds closed up 50 yuan, C bonds rose 70 yuan, and Tongding and Tongwu fell 50 yuan. The turnover was approximately 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Commission Approves Quality Standards for Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile Control Commission held a routine meeting today. It is heard that the meeting will approve the quality standards and grades for cotton yarns of various counts, so as to provide a basis for inspection and to determine the prices of cotton yarns of various counts. In addition, the selection of the person in charge of the sales agency of the Textile Construction Company will also be approved at today's meeting. After the selection of the person in charge, the sales agency will be deployed and established.</p>
<h3>Sentiment Improves in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The trend of falling prices in the yarn market has stopped yesterday. The morning opening continued the previous day's weakness, falling by 230,000. Then, with buyers arriving, the price of 10-count yarn gradually rose, and the people's sentiment improved. The trend of falling prices disappeared. As a result, 20-count and 32-count yarns rose by 230,000, while 42-count knitting yarn was relatively sluggish due to fixed prices and fell by 100,000. Textile Construction announced its prices at 11:00 AM. The price of 10-count Lanen Shuiyue was 100,000 lower than the previous period, and the price of 42-count yarn was 4.45 million yuan, which was a huge decrease of 400,000 compared to the previous period. However, the number of applications to purchase was not as enthusiastic as before, because the goods allocated in the previous period had already suffered losses, and with the end of the year approaching, they dared not try easily.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Continues to Allocate Yarn, a Total of 925 Pieces</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company continued to allocate yarn yesterday. A total of 218 manufacturers applied, including 122 factories and 96 yarn merchants. A total of 925 pieces of medium-count cotton yarn were allocated, including 494 pieces to factories and 431 pieces to yarn merchants.</p>
<h3>Few Transactions in Silk and Satin</h3>
<p>The Lunar New Year is approaching, and the money market is showing signs of tightening. Therefore, the silk and satin market is unusually quiet, with few transactions. Yesterday, the price of rayon remained the same as the previous day. Gaoshan was 350,000 yuan, and Xuzi was 330,000 yuan. There were a few transactions in factory-operated silk at other prices. Yesterday, factory-operated silk at other prices was opened at 450,000, 500,000, and 600,000 yuan for the best grade. Most of it was bought by out-of-town manufacturers. Dried warp also remained at the same price as the previous day. Warp cargo was even more deserted because the merchants had stopped purchasing. Yesterday, rayon quilt covers were 50,000 yuan for small ones, and Huazhong crepe was 100 yuan for small ones.</p>
<h3>The Production Loan Review Committee Is Working Very Intensively, Transferring People from Various Banks to Assist</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 13th regular meeting of the Temporary Review Committee for Production Loans of the Four Banks Joint Treasury was held at 1:30 PM on the 15th in the conference room of the Bank of China Building. The meeting was chaired by Huo Yamin, director of the committee, and attended by Li Fusun, Qin Zhongqing, Xu Qiqi, Lin Fengbao, Liu Gongyun, Cai Gongchun, and more than 20 specialist committee members. More than 40 loan applications were approved, with a total loan amount of more than 7 billion yuan. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM. It is heard that due to the approaching Lunar New Year and the imminent turnover, the number of loan applications to the committee from various factories has increased significantly. The committee has decided to borrow 10 more people from various banks to assist in handling affairs. The office will be open as usual this Sunday, and the next regular meeting on Monday will be held earlier at 3:00 PM on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Cloth Market Continues to Be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to be strong, taking advantage of the sharp rise of the previous day. The current spot stock of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is exhausted, resulting in a lack of transactions. The price of Wufu fine cloth rose by 1,500 yuan, and the prices of other brands were also strong. The price of Shilin cloth Meiting is flourishing because of the lack of high-end grey cloth, and the bleached cloth of the Hankou firm is very healthy.</p>
