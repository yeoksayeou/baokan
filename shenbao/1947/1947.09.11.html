<h3>建設改造兩項綱領黨團聯會廣泛討論　交付整理併成具體方案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕黨的新建設綱領及黨的改造綱領兩案，十日竟日由黨團聯席會作廣泛之交換意見，並於十日下午九時舉行之整理委會中作最後整理工作，以兩案合而爲一具體方案，十一日可提會討論。整理委員會名單，業由主席團擬定，並經大會通過，委員卅三人爲張厲生，谷正綱，梁寒操，康澤，蕭靜，賴璉，黃少谷，柳克述，王啓江，洪蘭友，余井塘，谷正鼎，李惟果，鄭彥棻，蔣經國，李俊龍，趙仲容，胡軌，方治，李翼中，龐鏡塘，余俊賢，黃季陸，李錫恩，李蒸，李樹森，周世光，任覺五，王政，劉蘅靜，許素玉，任卓宜，郭紫峻，召集人梁寒操，黃少谷，李蒸。黨的新建設綱領已見本報，茲誌改造方案要點如次：（一）原則，採取民主集權制，今後發展求普遍深入，能擴及農村，工廠，鑛塲，以至交通生產部門與海外。（二）黨員，重訂黨員標準，淘汰腐化惡劣份子，整肅革命陣容，就員團員重新登記編組後，根據民主原則，限期重新完成各級組織，並定於卅七年五月五日召開本黨全國代表大會，嚴防小組織。（三）對從政黨員繩以嚴格之紀律，如有在黨內造成或參加小組織者，開除黨籍，同時辦理黨員財產登記。</p>
<p>當前政治綱領部份，着重於下列各點：（一）動員全國力量剿匪。（二）積極收回東北主權，加強邊防。（三）如期實施憲政。（四）嚴懲貪汚，澈底刷新政治。（五）改善公教人員待遇。（六）力行土地改革。（七）限制通貸膨脹，禁止投機壟斷等。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕蔣總裁十日在黨團聯席會議中之書面訓詞，乃係於六月末在某次會中對黨內人員之訓詞，爲對當前時局之檢討與重要之決策，綜其大要，在歷述勝利以來共匪叛亂演變之經過，以及敵我軍事實力之比較。總裁在此項檢討中所獲得之結論，乃認爲共匪之優點不在軍事，長處不在政治，而是黨的組織紀律與宣傳，吾人實應就此有所認識並改善，是則我當可操勝券也，亦可謂一切軍事·政治·經濟之改革、均應從健全黨的組織，集中黨的力量着手。總裁復指出黨的當前急務爲團與黨的組織統一，以增新的力量，並盼黨員應對黨對革命負責任，堅定革命信心，恢復革命精神，爲黨負責，爲黨努力，同時，勉以確遵民主憲政之道路，完成建國工作。</p>
<h3>會塲空氣嚴肅融洽　各委員踴躍發言　僉盼積極領導羣衆消除匪患　對青年運動今後尤不可忽視</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕黨團聯席會議，今晨九時半在國大會堂舉行，出席五百卅七人，蔣總裁親自主席，秘書處報告事項後，宣讀總裁訓示「當前時局之檢討與本黨重要之決策」，宣讀畢，吳秘書長鐵城起立報告，略稱：四中全會暨黨團聯席會議之議題，現經中常會決定爲「如何加强本黨革命組織，革新政治，完成戡亂建國，貫澈後期某鄧之任務」，除一面徵詢各級黨部，團部同志意見外，一面由黨團統一組織委員會詳加硏究，擬具黨的新建設綱領草案，俾供討論之基礎，三民主義靑年團中央幹事會又擬定黨的改造綱領草案，而各級黨部團部同志對於此項議題亦發表甚多意見，茲一併提供大會，請就本案廣泛發表意見，提供具體辦法，並請推定整理委員彙總整理，再提出討論。至此休息廿分鐘，繼進行討論，鄧文儀等六人先後發表意見，會塲空氣極爲嚴肅融洽。</p>
<p>鄧文儀就渠最近巡視匪區歸來印象，發表意見，認爲針對目前剿匪情勢，本黨應就政策，方法，組織，宣傳各方面重新配合，始能收戡亂建國之效，匪區人民對本黨政策咸具信心，惟認在執行上尙欠澈底，致使共匪有可乘之機。鄧氏並揭露共匪在我後方策動三罷政策之陰謀，並提出我方應有之對策。</p>
<p>李金章指出，黨的組織訓練應避免形式化，着重科學化，加强戰鬥性重點，尤宜置於基層組織，以接近羣衆，領導羣衆爲中心，黨內考察監督並應加强。</p>
<p>周增霖說明共黨雖甚險毒，但本黨具有光榮歷史，博大組織，偉大主義，英明領袖，凡此優越條件，均非共匪所及，只要吾人振作努力，共匪實不足懼，而本黨一切革新，均應先由提高監察權着手。</p>
<p>湯如炎指出，共匪爲高度特務化，違反人性之組織，一切只重黨紀，而無感情，此其失敗之主因，故主張在本黨組織綱領中，必須紀律與感情並重，而政治綱領，應注重力行，同時建議在誓詞內要加入同生死，共患難，愛黨，愛同志之詞句。</p>
<p>羅才榮討論黨團所提之方案，首先必須提高愛黨的觀念，愛黨高於一切，黨是國家大動脈，團如國家新血輪，二者相輔相成。羅氐並主張在組織及政治綱領之外，應有行動綱領，對從政黨員，應嚴加考核，並動員同志，參加戰地工作。</p>
<p>鎭天錫就主持學校團務之經騐，指出共匪在策動學運是職業化，專門化，以金錢誘惑學生，惟多數學生均具正義感愛國心，希望德高望重之黨團先進，本其愛護靑年之熱忱，親赴各校講演指導，俾能感化靑年思想入於正軌，十二時五分散會。</p>
<p>下午三時續開黨團聯席會議，仍由總裁主席，各代表就「黨的新建設綱領草案」及「黨的改造綱領草案」廣泛交換意見，茲誌發言者及其內容要點如下：王志遠檢討方案內容，認爲應加强學校黨務，宜揚本黨光榮歷史，以三民主義救國救人之目的，必可獲得靑年之擁護。</p>
<p>馮雲仙特別提請大會注意邊疆問題，健全邊疆黨部，並積極領導婦女運動。</p>
<p>臧建心對由於社會經濟之動盪，致易引起靑年之苦悶，希望本黨先進積極領導，俾靑年有所寄託。</p>
<p>陳雪屛認爲在黨的綱領中，對靑年問題未能提及，實爲一大憾事，學生靑年因學校設備不够，社曾一般不克普遍，均有對現狀不滿之現象，吾人必須盡量設法，解決靑年所遭遇之若干困難。對由匪區逃出之靑年學生，尤須特別愛護，勿爲異黨利用。對若干自由主義之敎授，更不能因其言諭批評稍增偏激，即認其思想已有問題，要知彼等批評的動機　，實多出於愛護國家之熱忱，不能以此爲罪。</p>
<p>林永年主張在黨的組織及政洽綱領外，應有一行動綱領，惟此必須務實克己，避免自我宣傳，黨團統一組織後，此新生之黨在今後推行黨務時，要有新的作風，方能與當前之敵人共匪鬥爭，吾人應切實與民衆配合，先取得民衆同情信仰，然後始可建立黨的基礎，是以黨的工作人員與民衆打成一片，實爲首要。</p>
<p>謝仁釗發言，說明黨政革新黨國統一後所應注意者，即在如何迅速實行民生主義，吾人勢須由破壞走到建設，由不生產進入生產，是以本黨要鼓勵黨員從事工業生產，早日完成之建國之使命。至於靑年運動，今後尤不可忽視，希望在最近能在若干地區成立靑年運動委會，積極領導靑年</p>
<p>韓文溥認爲黨團統一組織後，應特別注重以下數項工作：（一）在民衆對共匪不希望其成功，而對國民黨則寄以深切希望，今天正是吾人努力機會。（二）吾人應努力爲民衆服務。（三）應普遍管理地方從政人負。（四）要輔助黨員向農工發展。</p>
<p>李曼魂檢討兩個方案內容，似均忽視思想領導之重要，因之主張：（一）加强文化工作，應以文化工作爲組織之基礎。（二）吸收站在國家民族利益上之進步份子，不可因其言論稍激，而即認爲思想不正，失去羣衆‘（三）培植有創造性之靑年，多設獎學金，積極扶助靑年深造。　集中力量，創辦幾種日報刊物，俾收宣傳之效。</p>
<p>四時三刻休息十五分鐘繼續開會，由居正主席，續有李曜林，鄧飛黃等發表意見。</p>
<p>李曜林謂：爲解救人民痛苦及完成建國使命，非黨團統一組織不足以達成此目的，黨團必須相互諒解，相互讓步，才可團結力量，消滅共匪。</p>
<p>鄧飛黃指出，從政黨員中小部分有脫黨之傾向，中央應嚴加管束，並使之參與黨的組織，而本黨基層組織不健全，亟應加强。至少數腐化份子，必須及時淸除，始能澈底改造。</p>
<p>胡秋原認爲，共匪能否消滅，不僅關係本黨之興衰，且決定國家之存亡，對目前局勢，胡氏主張澈底遴拔人才，加强黨內管治，並切實行動，以滿足人民之需要。</p>
<p>郭紫峻主張提高黨內下級工作同志之素質，並以工作能力決定其在黨內的地位，然的政策必須與行動一致，要用事實作對外之宣傳。</p>
<p>雷股提請大會注意民生主義之實行，今日因貧窮而引起之不安，只要本黨努力執行總理遺敎及總裁訓示，則此項問題不難解決，對此次所擬之黨的新建設方案，認爲應規定時限，始能如期完成。</p>
<p>任卓宣認爲、必須先有新的理論，然後能有新的行動，希望大家注意硏究後期革命之理論，以爲本黨改造之根據。任氏幷謂：本黨應從宣傳中求發展，從訓練中求黨的鞏固，二者不可偏廢，然最根本的是思想問題，要明瞭黨員一般之心理狀態，作正本淸源的工作。</p>
<p>童懷政以農民同志代表的身份，向大會指出，黨的基礎應建立在廣大的農村，今日之農民羣衆，在共匪殘酷之屠殺中，正期待本黨同志之援助與解救，他們信仰三民主義，擁護我們的領袖，此後加强農村工作，爲打擊共匪最有效的方法。</p>
<p>崔垂言主張加強本黨的鬥爭性，健全本黨基層組織，以接近羣衆，嚴格執行黨的任務。</p>
<p>孟淑範謂：當前剿匪期中，政治應配合軍事，　黨應加强匪區宣傳工作，使人民了解中央對彼等之關切，幷努力於除患及建設的任務。</p>
<h3>青年黨全代會宣言</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨第十一屆全國代表大會，於本月一日揭幕，會期九天，九日圓滿閉幕，頃該黨發表全代大會宣言，分就政治，軍事，外交，經濟，財政各點有所論述，略稱：</p>
<p>（一）就政治言，吾人確認當前政治有澈底改革的必要，亦確有逐漸改進的可能，其所以成爲今日之麻痺現象者半由歷史的因襲，半由制度之不良，而表現於戰時與戰後的一切措施，又爲構成此一麻痺現象的主要原因之所在。</p>
<p>補救之道，第一，在謹守民主憲政之軌道，力求其逐步實施。第二，黨德不立，民德不彰，爲樹立政然風範計，寗以公道守法而失欺，不可以巧取豪奪而成功。第三，政策之運用，不貴乎面面俱到，而貴乎把握重點，至於矯正泄沓敷衍之習，杜絕奔競傾軋之風，此對於當前政象，尤爲必要。第四，中央與地方權責之劃分，宜一本憲法所規定，中央束縛地方，即自治　度無從樹立，而民主精神亦無從普及於全國。第五，人才之登用，固宜有一公平寬大之制度，而人才之培育，則實有待於獎進與混磨，必須使國民慎用其選舉權，營論界慎用其批評權，政黨能勤於其黨員之訓練，而今日第一大黨如國民黨者，又必須能本公平原則，對於中央政權尤其地方政權，更能使其他黨派與無黨派人士各視其力量之大小，而有參與實際政治之機會。</p>
<p>（二）以言軍事，吾人素主軍隊國家化，欲實現此一原則，不外軍事教育宗旨與制度之確立，軍隊質素與訓練之提高，兵役義務之公平與普遍，軍官晋級之慎重與嚴格，軍需分配之要實與公開，尤要者則在軍民分治之實行，軍區制度之確定，至於目前動員戡亂之舉措，吾人亦確認欲解決此一問題，決非單純寄希望於軍事所能有效，如政治不作澈底的改革，亦決無以確保其戰果。</p>
<p>（三）就外交言，吾民族崇尙和平，其擁護聯合國憲章一點，且明定於，因之，凡願與吾人和平相處者，吾人莫不願引以爲友，但以今日國際關係之密切，所謂和平，必需以確保世界和平爲先決條件，至吾人對於日本之重建，果能以禁止其恢復武裝爲基本條件，幽不願作過分的苛求，果其全國人民能繼續發揮其勤儉之良好習慣，以從事和平民主之建設，而其經濟發展，又不致威脅我國之生產前途，吾人即不惜與之恢復正常關係。</p>
<p>（四）就經濟言，吾人主張除極少數非民力所能經營之重工業或交通事業之帶有全國性，及與國防直接有關之若干事項以外，一切應以民營爲原則，官商合辦之方式，旣爲腐化之謀，官督商辦，幽爲罪惡之　，今後必須澈底加以矯正。就財政言，吾人主張澈底整頓中國之財政，必以改革幣制發其端，以增加生產固其本，然後以　定稅制，整飭紀綱神其用，否則公債決難暢銷，外債亦難籌措，稅收亦爲無源之水，而一切貪汚中飽之風，乃更足以促整個局面之屬潰，所謂廉潔政治，將徒託空談，所謂支收平衡，將適成盡併。（完）</p>
<h3>黨員財產登記　辦法指定交全會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕國民黨爲欲普遍瞭解黨員之生活狀態，防止黨員貪汚及其他不正當經濟行爲，決定舉辦然員財產登記，辦法業經擬定，大致如次：</p>
<p>黨員入黨時，即行辦理登記，黨的各級領導幹部從政主管官吏以及參加國營公營事業之主管人員，其登記應特別詳盡。登記係就目前社會經濟狀况而論，平日收支足以相抵而財產合戰前五千元以上者，視爲生活可能自給之黨員，以上類推。如有因過去不正當行爲而成爲特別富裕之黨員，其不參加財產登記者，應厲行黨紀制裁。該項辦法經全會通過即可付諸實行。</p>
<h3>王外長今飛紐約與各國領袖商對日媾和主張和約應受普遍支持</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山九日電〕我外長王世杰，定十一日飛往紐約，在聯合國大會開幕前，不擬訪問華盛頓，王氏九日在記者招待會中稱，其來美之職責之一，將爲與直接關切於日本媾和之其他各國領袖接觸。渠重申「吾人之目標，應爲一受衆人支特之全體和約」。王氏係鑒於蘇聯一再要求草擬日本和約之工作限於四強，而不由美國建議之遠東委會十一會員國主持一節而發表此項言論者。王外長解釋稱，蘇聯採取此種立塲之原因，在於蘇聯惟恐十一國家參加會議中，因三分之二多數通過表決制之故，其發言可能極爲無效也。至於和約中賠償一端，王氏謂：中國不擬要求使日本永久束縛之任何事物，同時，表明中國與日作戰最久，受創最深，自應獲得賠償之大部份。王外長於答覆大迎僵局問題時稱，蘇聯認爲對日戰爭尙未終了，彼等仍有權利在軍事上佔據該港。中國政府認爲對日戰爭早已結束，大連依理應屬於中國。渠且謂蘇聯對中蘇條約中若干條款之解釋，將非客觀人士所能接受者。王氏警吿謂，遠東和平，端賴忠實遵守中蘇條約之文字與精神，否則遠東情勢將十分惡劣。工氏亦曾論及共產黨問題及若干美國人士指責中國政府分配聯總救濟物資時有過失行爲一說。渠認爲中國政府與共產黨在交通恢復及共產黨主力未殲滅前，決無和談可能。共產主義在中國與在其他國家相同，如能建立有效且有力</p>
<h3>蘇不參加對韓會議我政府表示極失望</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕行政院新聞局十日下午四時半舉行中外記者招待會，由　局長親自主持，茲擇誌問答如下：</p>
<p>問，舉行四國會議討論朝鮮問題之建議，已被蘇聯拒絕，中國政府對此有何反響？中國政府曾否接到美國政府之正式照會，謂此項會議因蘇方拒絕而將延緩舉行？</p>
<p>答，蘇聯政府不同意美國召開四國會議之建議，中國政府感覺非常失望，朝鮮統一日實現，實爲中國政府一貫之期望，今年四月中國政府即曾建議倘佔領朝鮮兩國不能協議，則須召集來加一九四五年十一月在莫斯科成立有關朝鮮協定之四個國家會商，爲對朝鮮人民之公允及求遠東之政治穩定起見，中國政府竭誠希望關於解決朝鮮問題四國仍能得一致行動。關於問題中所詢第二點，中國政府尙未接到美國方面之正式照會。</p>
<p>問，蘇船「伊里奇」號載運客貨駛滬，中國政府之抗議蘇方已有答復否？</p>
<p>答，中國政府尙未接獲蘇方之答復。</p>
<p>問，中國政府曾否訓令王外長於聯合國大會席間代表中國有特殊事項之提議？</p>

<h3>白部長在四中全會　軍事報告全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕國防部長白崇禧：九日下午在四中全會首次大會中報告軍事，就「軍事設施」「制度推行」「剿匪概况」分別詳加檢討，茲誌全文於次：</p>
<p>甲　前言</p>
<p>自共匪背棄民國以來，先後破壞政府所頒之停戰令，否認全國民意所制定之憲法，窮兵　武，包藏禍心，非使中華民國淪於萬刼不復不止，本部秉承最高統帥之命令，繼續實行剿匪戡亂，拯救匪區人民，同時建立軍事制度，以為建軍之宏規，自七月四日政府頒布全國總動員令後，使我政軍兩略之協調，益臻緊密，軍事行動之目的，亦更為顯明，故政策得以推行順利。蓋動員令下後，即進入「一切為剿匪，一切為勝利」階段，全國上下，一致奮起，淬勵進行，所有政治經濟上睹般設施，皆以集中於剿匪勝利為目的，而軍事方面，自更宜以貫澈軍事上之勝利為核心，而　　　　剿匪局勢。今後之軍事政策，在「剿匪第一」之前提下，第一，為充實第一綫兵團兵員缺額，適時徵補，以維經常戰力；第二，建立第二綫兵團，為國軍之總預備隊，以新生之力量，提早達成勝利；第三，健全地方自衛組織，普遍加强民衆組訓，使軍民配合，以發揮全面戰術，確保面的控制；第四，一般軍政方面，着重現代化軍事制度之建立與推行，以奠定國軍百年之基礎，與國防安全之確保。</p>
<p>總之，為適應總動員，俾軍事政策能配合一切人力，物力之動員，確切達成軍事上之勝利，依此改訂計劃，作合理之推行，俾能克復一切困難，完成戡亂使命。茲　舉半年來剿匪經過及有關軍政措施，分別加　報告。</p>
<p>乙　關於軍政之設施</p>
<p>軍政設施，經　萬　，本部在不斷達行中。茲舉當前需要及國人所關心者，略述如左：</p>
<p>（一）復員官佐之安置：復員官佐之安置，前係依預定計劃實施，自動員令頒布後，所有復員軍官，除已有安置者外，其不能轉業及年富力强者，一律留用，儲為補充幹部，現各軍官總（大）隊已全部結束，而復員軍官佐安置之工作，亦已告一段落矣。茲將過去安置情形，分述於左：一，復員軍官佐之人數，自國軍整編後，卅五年底共計約廿四萬人（內編餘軍官佐約十六萬餘人），失業者約七萬餘人，分由各軍官總（大）隊收訓。二，復員軍官佐之安置，分留用，轉業，退（除）役三種，原定留用二萬人，轉業十五萬人，退役一萬五千人，　因編餘人數較預定者增多，約計廿四萬人，且以時局影響，轉業困難，結果留用約七萬人，轉業五萬五千餘人，退役十萬餘人。三，復員將官之安置　共計二千五百餘人，除轉業退役外，大部留用。四，復員軍官轉業人數，統計為五萬餘人。</p>
<p>（二）官兵待遇之調整：官兵待遇受物價影響，維持生活異常艱苦，因之直接影響作戰，間接影響人民觀感，雖經本年二五兩月作二次稍加調整，然以物價不斷高漲，軍官生活仍無法改善，士兵生活尤為惡劣，幸蒙政府採取文武待遇一致之措施，於八月份起調整官兵待遇，其大要如左：一，官佐底薪，比較同級文官之中間級薪額支給，如少將將按簡任五級計，上尉按委任二三級中間級計。二，士兵依抗戰前實得餉額，即軍士按一萬倍，上等兵按一萬二千倍，一二等兵按一萬五千倍計算增加。三，武職官兵，因部隊調動頻繁，為使於補給，不予分區，各地待遇，均按文職第二區標準計算，即基本數三千九萬元，底薪一千六百倍，東北新疆台灣另予提高。四，嗣後文職人員調整待遇時，軍職人員同時比照調整。（未完）</p>

<p>日本政局，月來又在動盪不定之中了。片山內閣為了和緩議會反對黨的攻勢，請議會自九月一日至十四日，延期兩週。在此兩週期間，日本政局并無好轉的跡象。一方面反對黨領袖吉田茂，發動自由黨幹部，作全國各地旅行演說，多方抨擊政府，以為倒閣的準備：另一方面現任外務大臣兼中央聯絡事務局長官蘆田均，突於六日發表反政府演說，指出「片山內閣之政策，業已碰壁，現內閣已失去國民信仰，處於不得不讓出政權之時。」并指出吉田現正籌組新黨，若能成功，民主黨將有多人脫黨，且暗示新黨新政策，為應付盟國對日和會，渠對此事深有興趣，看趨勢，反對黨力量似很强烈，現內閣陣容已有裂痕；片山如何應付？麥帥如何點頭？已成為現內閣生死存亡的關鍵了。</p>
<p>片山內閣，係於本年六月一日組成。片山為社會黨領袖，社會黨於四月選舉中，躍居國會中第一大黨，依日本憲法規定，首相由國會選舉，片山遂獲得壓倒的勝利，總攬新憲法首屆內閣。片山為了團結各黨，曾進行籌組四黨聯合政府，因自由黨的不合作而告失敗，乃轉舵爭取民主黨，結果蘆田入　，勉强成立三黨聯合政府，但片山三月來的施政，則以「四黨政策協定」為依歸，期待自由黨的合作。平心而論，片山本人有政治家的胸襟與氣度，頗能獲得一般公正的好評。片山是以「進步」姿態出現的，他為了日本的復興，不斷進行各種改革，更不斷爭取美國的援助，而麥帥也相當獎掖片山的改革，尤其滿意片山政府之恭順態度。論理，片山政府應受人民的擁護，應受在野黨的支持，然而片山遭遇的暗礁重重，在野黨堅强的反政府活動，及蘆田分裂政府的態度，勢已至攤牌的局面了。</p>
<p>反對黨反對片山政府的理由有二：一在經濟上，他們認為現政權未能安定日本的經濟，片山改良社會主義性的改革，如準備將煤礦產歸國家管制，民間產業界卽堅決反對，吉田茂之自由黨，更公開表示反對：致使片山的施政障礙重重。二在政治上，他們認為現政權懦弱無能，對內不能芟除共產黨力量，對外不能爭取對日和會的良機，使日本在非常有利形勢下，獲取「和約勝利，」倖僥以得「平等待遇，」「不喪權，不賠償。」自由黨基於經濟上政治上的理由，反對片山政府，顯然是為了保衛日本的舊勢力，為了保衛日本的軍國主義，而意圖日本舊勢力的復活。今天的日本，仍以舊勢力為支柱，所以反對黨在野的活動，能够一呼百諾，甚至蘆田均也投機附和了。此乃片山政府命運之不幸，也是日本保守勢力暗流的橫決，達到了政治的分水嶺。</p>
<p>日本保守勢力的抬頭，不僅是日本民主政治之不幸，並且也是日本和平安定前途之不幸。現在吉田醞釀組織的新黨，便是為了結合保守派頑固勢力，彼輩預備以爭取「和約勝利」為號召，推翻現政府，主宰次期政權，俟和約完成，再謀日本主義的復活。據本月四日東京讀賣新聞報導：前首相吉田茂，前首相幣原重喜郎，樞密院長松平恒雄，前駐蘇大使佐藤尚武，正以第一流外交家的姿態，於和會前組成新黨，並取得次期政權。看情勢，「新外交家」蘆田，也醉心新黨的活動，如果這個新黨真能組成，麥帥又點頭同意，則片山內閣必瓦解無疑。吉田為保守派的主腦，幣原松平不僅保守，並有極度的頑固，佐藤與蘆田，乃日本侵略戰中的陰謀家，本應列為戰犯，嚴重懲處，也並不苛刻，但今天的蘆田，彈冠相慶不够，現文在政治上大肆投機取巧，佐藤更從事新的陰謀，實為遠東和平的威脅。此種情事說明了今天的日本，民間並無所謂與論制裁，麥帥的寬大縱容，並無所謂戰爭責任的追究。照這情形演變下去，保守勢力必愈益抬頭，日本政治永無光明，這是誰的錯誤？我們很願聽聽美國的論斷如何。</p>
<p>總之，日本政局的動盪不安，是保守勢力抬頭的結果，是反動勢力輻射的必然反映。日本政治現已至分水嶺，片山內閣和的生死命運，勢將讓反動勢力和麥帥去安排了。日本議會復開後，片山以第一黨地位，論理應安然渡過難關，暫時苟延其壽命。至新黨成熟後，片山政府則有兩條路可走：一為爭取「和約勝利」，投降新黨；另為財政經濟所困擾，反動勢力所脅迫，讓出政權於保守派。除此以外，片山似乎很少有新的途徑可循。</p>

<h3>波拉爾正式宣布法對越停戰條件　越盟是否同意尚成問題　法方堅持越盟須人部接受或拒絕</h3>
<p>〔合衆社西貢十日電〕法國十日對越南，允許其全部政治獨立，成立法國聯邦之一部。此項條件，由法國駐越高級專員波拉爾在海防發表演說時加以宣佈。其目的乃在終止自去年十二月來即發生於法國與越盟共和國間之流血戰爭。按波拉爾在巴黎與法總理賴瑪迪及其他政府領袖經過長時期之會議後，最近始返越南。法國對越南所提出之條件要點如下：（一）法國將越南全部國內行政權交與越南各邦；（二）法國要朮對親法之越南人士加以保障其安全；（三）法越交換軍事及政治俘虜；（四）在平時，越南各邦由警察維持國內秩序，但如遭受外國侵略，法國對越負有防衛責任，則越南各邦警察力量應加入於法軍之內作戰；（五）越南各邦須遵守一切法國聯邦政府與外國所締結之條約。波拉爾强調法國所提出之條件，應全部加以接受，或全部加以拒絕。同時，如接受此項條件，應先由雙方下停戰令。波拉爾呼籲所有越南政治團體，皆起而解決越南國內之糾紛，共同參加建設曾受戰爭蹂躪之越南。渠力稱，渠代表法國政府，作此項正式呼籲，「在法國聯邦機構下，越南獲得自由，此將成爲法人與越南人民未來關係之基礎。除開此等領土屬於法國聯邦一項事實以外，並無其他限制。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕此間今日接獲西貢來電稱，法駐越南高級專員波拉爾今日在發表廣播演說，允將越南政權交還越盟共和國，惟以越南仍應處於法蘭西聯邦以內，且准許法國保留軍事設備，支配越南外交政策爲條件。末一點即去年巴黎會議時越盟領袖胡志明所曾反對者。</p>
<p>〔中央社河內九日電〕越南戰事漸近尾聲。據半官方報道，法政府已決定與胡志明政府成立協議，以澄淸越南狀况。據三日前自越南軍控制區退出之越南人稱，該區一般狀况仍良好，越南軍係由秘密路徑獲得大部軍火，越南人多半仍支持胡志明。</p>
<p>越右派擁載保大</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港十日電〕越南二十一個右派政治社會及宗敎團體代表，正式要求前越南王保大接受越南政權，與法國談判，恢復越南和平。越南大部份代表於九日自西貢抵港，痛斥胡志明政府，謂其採用政治之極權反民主及反民族行動，促成分裂，破壞越南之物質及文化。各代表請求書中力言越南人民深信保大能完成人民要求，統一獨立之希望。代表中包括交趾支那邦之臨時總統在內。</p>
<h3>聯合國干涉印尼事件　范莫克深致不滿　認爲反使爭端遲不解決</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕荷督范莫克今日談稱：余以爲聯合國對印尼問題不能予以有效之解決，惟荷蘭之「警衛行動」始爲消滅該島不穩武裝部隊之辦法，但荷蘭仍當待吧城六領事向聯合國提出報吿之後，再行採取下一行動。</p>
<p>鑒於安理會過去處理其他爭端之經過情形，余對其解決印尼問題之能力不甚樂觀，聯合國之干涉印尼事件，適足使之遲遲不獲解決，但倘能探明事實眞相，則亦屬有其用處。印尼政府雖無改組之象徵，但爲消滅欲使該地局勢不獲安定之份子，則在共和國完成其獨立之前，殊需先加改組。荷軍現在印尼境內共有九萬三千人，其中七萬人係荷蘭人，餘者皆爲島民。余此次來美，自與馬歇爾國務卿會議及荷駐美大使克里芬斯所盡之種種努力後，美國今亦已瞭解荷蘭之立塲。其次，印尼糾紛中之共產勢力，亦不可忽視。今聯合國領事官員所將提出之報吿，就余所知，惟雙方皆能遵守停戰令始可解決，而印尼方面實至今未遵停戰令云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞十日電〕安尼泰通訊社稱：荷軍司令斯波爾將軍業已允准華僑保安隊担任自動協助警衛隊之職，保護房屋工廠及倉庫，惟祇准値班時佩帶武器。</p>
<h3>中比兩總領赴戰區視察</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞十日電〕中國總領事蔣家棟與比利時總領事史蒂契倫今日啓程赴爪哇西部，將於本週末向聯合國領事調査團報吿萬隆，蘇甲巫眉，與塔西克馬拉耶等地停戰令執行經過情形。</p>
<p>〔中央社雪梨九日電〕澳軍官四人，已首途至爪哇，以軍事視察者地位，視察荷印戰事。美政府同時亦派軍事視警員八人。</p>
<h3>緬獨立法案　英下院下月討論</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕英下院於十月底復會時，英王喬治六世將蒞塲致辭，屆時當宣布緬甸政權之立法方案，權威政界人士預料下院秋季節目中，當以移轉緬甸政權案爲最先討論之案。該案丙容必甚簡短與移轉印度政權之法案相似。</p>
<h3>英南舉行　秘密會談</h3>
<p>〔路透社維也納九日電〕此間今日透露英駐：奧高級專員史蒂爾中將，曾與南期拉夫總理狄托元帥在南國夏都勃萊特舉行秘密會談，關於若干重要問題業已成立協議。</p>
<p>此間英方人士謂，此次會談之舉行，係因狄托元帥鑒於史蒂爾中將處理南奧邊界事件手法之微妙，故欲乘史氏離奧就任新職前與其一晤，就英南間之若干重要問題舉行商討。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕此間外交界人士認爲狄托之決定逖英駐奧高級專員史蒂爾與其當面晤談，乃英埃緊張關係减輕之明證，近數月來由於南國與奧國英軍區卡林西亞省之邊疆一帶一再發生事件，已成英南間摩擦之主要間題。狄托之發起與史蒂爾晤談，可證狄托之具有解決兩國間爭執之誠意。此間官方人士不信在勃萊特之會談中，業已成立重大決議。</p>
<h3>美糧食供給希軍</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典九日電〕美援希使鄧團團長葛里斯伍持今日透露：美國於九月一日起，業已替代英國負担以糧食供應希臘正規軍十尤人之責任，此筆費用佔計當需美金二千八百萬元，業已儲積之糧食今已足敷三個月之用。</p>
<h3>美國聯合國大會　馬歇爾親自出席　對日和約將在會外討論</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕國務卿馬歇爾下週領導美代表團出席聯合國大會時，希望在會外與他國外長會商對日和約起草問題，以獲得他國對其原來決定之支持。如蘇聯仍不改變其立塲，則將不令蘇聯參加。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓九日電〕聯合國全體大會定下週二展幕，美國方面極爲重視，將由馬歇爾國務卿親自担任代表團團長之職，率領代表團於本週五飛赴紐約。據國務院發言人稱，國務院將留於紐約，直至四强外長會議十一月在倫敦舉行。馬卿決以兩個月之時間，在聯合國大會中努力，足見未來大會重要性之一斑。自一九四六年員爾納斯親率代表團出席聯大會以還，美國務卿親自率領代表此爲首次。美代表團將於週五開始工作，籌備討論工作。此次出席大會之五强，除蘇聯之莫洛托夫外，其他四國均由外長出席。中國外長王世杰可於事前到達，參加開幕典禮。法外畏皮杜爾則可望於數日後到達。貝文與莫洛托夫均將於大會開始進行後參加出席。此次美代表團除馬歇爾國務卿外，尙有美駐聯合國代表奧斯汀曁羅斯福夫人。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫境內發現　反共武裝游撃隊　狄托已無法再予以掩飾</h3>
<p>〔中央社安加拉九日電〕關於巴爾幹問題有一重大之局勢，世人迄尙未注意及之，即南斯拉夫境內有大規模之反共武裝游擊隊。據各方面消息，南國游擊隊係由反對共黨及蘇聯控制之愛國份子所組成，與希臘游擊隊甚爲相似。二者均以由外國鼓動反抗本國之統治政權，惟其代表之主義與國家則有不同。觀察家認爲此事不啻係以狄托慣用之手法，（即訓練裝備供應希臘叛黨）予狄托之打擊。</p>
<p>惟狄氏因亟欲宣揚其鐵腕而盡力避免國際方面明瞭國內有叛黨存在。昨日貝爾格勒方面首次正式承認叛黨之存在，此係由貝爾格勒新）聞處長發表聲明承認者。據稱，山區中現有隱匿叛軍，據希臘報紙稱，希境已可聞及砲聲，故狄托已無法再予掩飾。據聞南國游擊隊均係由奧境英佔領區供應訓練，自本年七月以來實力突增，因而隨即佔領南國國內之若干要地。</p>
<h3>英代表團人選</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫教九日專電〕英出席聯合國大會代表團，昨晚已公佈。員文爲首席代表，其他代表則為國務大臣麥克尼爾，檢察長蕭克勞斯，殖民部大臣瓊斯，英出席安理會代表買德幹。</p>

<p>白俄羅斯代表團長爲白俄羅斯部長會議副主席兼外長基塞萊夫，團員爲斯科羅波加台·施謨果夫·斯摩利雅。卡明斯基。</p>
<h3>實施馬卿援助西歐計劃美須貸欵二百十九億元　歐洲十六國專家已完成草案</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎九日電〕可靠方面息，討論馬歇爾援歐計劃之歐洲十六國專家業已決定爲執行歐洲之四年經濟復興計劃起見，當需要美國供給貸款二百十九億元，此項數字雖經擔任起草工作之專家通過，尙未經十六國經濟合作委員會批准，但料後者之批准，必不致發生問題。此二百十九億元之數已較數日前原來之估計减少八十億元。據可靠之非正式方面稱，美國務院已曾暗示援助額近於二百億元者，當較近於三百億元者易爲國會通過，歐洲國家估計數字之减低，原因或即在此。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十日電〕義大利外長沙福柴業已接受英外相貝文之邀請，出席九月十五日在巴黎舉行之馬歇爾會議，屆時法外長皮杜爾亦將出席。</p>
<h3>國際新關稅協定大部份已告完成</h3>
<p>英美關稅談判進展順利</p>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦九日電〕日內瓦之關稅談判預定至星期三結束，屆時可望業已完成或近乎完成之新關稅協定，將有七十組，所餘者尙有三十八組，包括比較最重要之若干組。秘書處之拉加特氏報吿關稅談判之進展情形時，謂談判之進展苟能保持目前之速度，則全部談判於八月中旬即可完成。大致而論，世界之貿易壁壘將可因此減低，英共和邦代表團今晨曾與美代表團舉行談判，前此曾提出關於减低帝國貿易優惠制之若千建議，該組之談判固爲各組中之最重要者。美方代表威爾柯克於接獲新建議後定週三飛巴黎晤美副國務卿克萊頓，商美國應取之行動，預料克萊頓若無突然轉硬之態度，則英美間之關稅談判今後當可順利展開。</p>
<h3>調解英埃爭端　我提折衷案　安理會辯論展期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：安理會各代表現均努力促使英埃問題在下週二聯合國大會展幕前吿一段落。中國代表對於此事，進行尤爲不遺餘力，聞已提出折衷方案。本方發言人稱：凡促成恢復英埃談判及承認一九三六年英埃條約有效性之建議，英方均表示歡迎。目前除中國代表外，其他各國代表亦在進行覓取折衷方案。</p>
<h3>兩大國際金融機構開會　商世界財政局勢　美元恐慌將爲討論主題</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕國際銀行及國際貨幣基金會定於星期四起在此舉行爲期十五日之會議，四十五國之代表及顧問二百餘人，已於今日在此舉行籌備會議。</p>
<p>同時與會之英自治領及殖民地代表，並準備舉行英鎊區各帝國國家之會談，以討論財政局勢及美元恐嚇。帝國代表雖不願預示此項會談之結果，僅表示如能成立若干統一的計劃，以渡過得以擬具正常國際貿易計劃以前之美元危機，則英鎊區之討論可望提高至政府階級之討論。觀察家對於國際銀行及國際貨幣基金會之是否均得彼利用以解決英國及歐洲之美元恐慌，尚表懷疑，但彼等認爲此次會議之討論中心，必將爲世界普遍的美元缺乏現象。此兩國際金融機構，固握有數十億億美元，若能予以流通運用，可使歐洲在獲得馬歇爾計劃下援助前之過渡期間，得以保持生存而不致窒息。惟以國際銀行及國際貨幣基金會之創立宗旨，原不在處理國際財政困難，　料英財相道爾頓於首次會議中，即將建議修正該兩機構之創立宗旨，俾得應付當前之危局。</p>
<h3>歐洲急需資金　世界銀行碍難協助</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓九日電〕世界銀行副行長嘉納，今於記者招待會中稱：凡以爲世界銀行可以緊急基金供歐洲購買食物及其他重要物品者，均屬錯誤。嘉納强調世界銀行本有種種規定之限制，貸款須用於生產方面使用。關於該行是否舉辦穩定通貨貸款，以重建貨幣制度一頭，據稱，渠尚無所悉。據該行常務理事之解釋，該行可允諾　定幣制之長期貸款。關於波蘭申請六億美元貸款事，因其決定不參加歐洲經濟復興會議，嘉氏暗示此項申請，可能長時延擱。</p>
<h3>法設特別委會　應付美元危機</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎九日電〕法國政府步英國之後塵，今亦採取嚴厲措施，以節省日在減縮中之美匯及應付即將到來之經濟風瀨。同時特組織一「節省法郎」之六人特別委員會，由賴瑪迪埃總理兼任主席，財長施曼，國民經濟部長費里蒲，國務員戈殷，法蘭西銀行總裁莫尼克，五年復興計劃</p>
<h3>美臨時援歐計劃幽須由國會通過　馬卿認爲有實施此項計劃必要</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：馬歇爾今日聲稱：在馬歇爾計劃未能生效實施前，需要一種臨時過渡時期之援助計劃，以便應付今冬不可忍受之飢寒。但此項過渡計劃，亦須美國會通過。至于國會是否召集特會，馬鄉表示：對于細則尙未有所決定，無論如何。此種過渡計劃亦爲馬歇爾計劃之一部份。</p>
<h3>勞動界發動九月攻勢　日政府考慮讓步　國民協同黨否認參與新黨運動</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十日電〕片山內閣對於最近自由黨之政治攻勢，雖在進行對抗中，然片山等在政策上頗爲堅定，對政權亦頗有自信，但關於所謂「九月勞動攻勢」，則似有難於應付，而呈捉襟見肘之勢。商相水谷在九州視察時，接見中小工業代表談稱：自十一月一日起，普通主食亦可完全配給，故生活將大可改善。而在十一月一日以前之問題果如何解決，正在與米窪勞動相研究中。</p>
<p>標凖工資過低政府決予補救</p>
<p>現行一千八百元之平均工資，頗不合理，將來或應考慮採用赤字津貼方法。又經濟安定本部長官和田於九日抵秋田視察水產工業時，幽戈示一千八百元標凖平均工資不能維持生活，且謂政府並無將其凍結之必要。綜觀水谷，和田等之意見，片山內閣對於現正蓬勃於各地要求增加工資運動，將表示讓步，以求緩和勞動攻勢，</p>
<p>煤礦國營法案難期順利通過</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十日電〕日政府與各黨協商擬訂之臨時煤礦國家管理法案，於國會復會時即將提出，就現在情勢，除自由黨及各小黨，煤礦業公會（資本家）等有反對表示外，參院方面亦有難色。再者，最近之新黨運動，對此問題亦有影響，故將來是否可在國會中順利通過，殊難逆料。西尾就此特於十日談稱：「煤礦國家管理問題，已成爲決定片山內閣命運之關鍵。國會中審議，預料自必有相當困難，然政府仍確信其能通過。至若由煤礦業公會之反對而流產，則將予勞動大衆以惡劣之影響，而三千萬噸之產炭量，亦難實現。故此法案若流產，則今後之主要政策亦將無法維持」。</p>
<p>礦業堅決反對商相束手無計</p>
<p>水谷商相在福岡，亦曾就煤礦國家管理問題接見九州之煤礦經營業者，但因煤礦業猛烈反對，商相不能說服，終至不歡而散。</p>
<p>〔新亞社南京十日電〕日本國民協同黨出身之片山內閣遞相三木，九日在松江市談稱：外傳國民協同黨幹部有參與吉田自由黨總裁之新黨運動之事，全非事實。</p>
<h3>盟軍總部宣佈開放中日商電</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十日電〕盟軍總部十日宣佈重開中國，日本，冲繩，韓國間之商業無綫電，中國及冲繩來電須經馬尼刺轉送，韓國來電則由舊金山或馬尼剌轉送。</p>
<h3>德境英美區佔領費英請美担任大部份</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕參議院撥款委員會九日奉召湍返華盛頓，俾於本月二十日舉行緊急會議，討論英國籲請美國担任德境佔領費之大部份，英國方面認爲應付此項費用，大感困難。緊接撥款委員會之召集，陸軍部發表英美討論佔領費問題之會議，將於十月初在此間舉行。英國政府對現行佔領費分配方式要求全盤考慮。按目前合併後之英美佔領區費用，係兩國平均負担。陸軍部透露、英國認爲重行考慮一事，在去歲十二月之協定中曾有規定、現已屆其時矣。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕此間十日獲悉：美國將要求無條件管制德國西部經濟，以抵償其担負火部份佔領費。高級政府人士稱：英國每年在德國之費用、超過二萬七千萬金元。美國如担當其主要部份，當堅持對德國西部事務負更大之責任，甚至由美國在經濟方面加以管制。此項新佔領方略將使美國具有全部權力及責任，主宰德國之善後努力。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕今日據悉，美國已應倫敦方面之緊急請求，凖備負担德境英軍佔領經費中大部份，爲數恐在七千五百萬美元至一億美元間。專員蒙納皆爲該會委員，此因美匯黑市已跳至二百八十七法郎，而官定匯率爲一百廿法郞，遂採取此項緊急措施云。</p>
<h3>自知罪無可逭　東條皈依佛法</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十日電〕東條英機自知其發動太平洋戰爭罪無可逭，故命其親近家屬及早代爲凖備死後之法謚，今春四月間曾飭其夫人轉囑其在小倉市萬德寺出家之外甥德永哲天方丈代爲命名。德永經長期之推敲後，即命以「英照院釋慈光明朗居士」之名，並朝夕爲東條誦經，祈其超生。德永並就此項命名談稱：初擬命以適合軍人身份之法謚，結果想由佛力挽救其生前罪惡，故採用「道光明朗而超然」之佛語。</p>
<h3>溥儀登台係出自願</h3>
<p>提出重要證詞</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十日電〕在華担任記者多年之伍德海，今晨於送致此間國際軍事法庭之證詞中稱，傀儡皇帝溥儀，並非被日人自天津綁架至東北者。伍氏之證言，係以其一九三二年九月在長春訪問溥儀時之談話爲根據，據伍氏稱：溥儀對於「滿洲國皇帝」之職位，甚感愉快。渠並吿伍氏稱：　因　項動權　出任「滿洲國皇帝」之職，此二動機爲：（一）自滿淸企圖將主權交付人民後，中國即發生內戰及　擾；（二）國民黨對渠極「不敬」，取消其俸錄，且沒收其私人財產。伍氏並稱：溥儀　時謂渠決定從事改進其祖先發源省份之一切情况。</p>
<h3>盟總將解散日農民協會</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處東京九日電〕基督敎科學箴言報特派員華克，在其最近之通訊中、討論日本之土地改革計劃。渠稱：日本之農民現正進行一種雙重革命，現已遍及小鎮與鄉村最遠之角落。第重革命即盟總所謂土地專分計劃，旨在打破封建之佃租制度。盟總之另一革新尙未發動，但已成熟，此計劃之目的在於解散農業協會，此等協會代表中央政府管制日本農民之一切事宜，達四十八年之久。</p>

<h3>英將實行裁軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：政府高級官員談稱：英國將實行裁減軍隊，至首相艾德禮前所建議之數字以下。至裁减程度尙未確定，但決非改變戰略之謂。按艾德禮曾建議在一九四八年三月底將英國軍隊减至一百萬零七千，藉以减少政府支出，並騰出人力、從事民間工作。</p>
<h3>最後</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：馬歇爾在新聞記者招待會中稱：蘇聯確已拒絕美國召開四强會議討論朝鮮問題之建議。馬氏謂美國正與其他相關之十國商討召開十一國會議事。在不久將來，美國即將發出請柬至對日和會相關各國。</p>
<h3>尼赫魯決心產最大力量　制止印種族鬥爭　甘地呼籲放下屠刀恢復和平</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里九日電〕尼赫魯今夜廣播，堅決表示決以一切力量制止暴動。渠力言報復不是奸事，而目前之現象猶更甚於報復。在世界人士之目光中，此直屠殺行爲。自軍事觀點而論，此等屠殺行爲必須予以制止。「吾人將建立新印度，抑將加以毀滅乎，吾人必須制止此一惡現象，吾人必須拯救西本哲布之人民，並制止殺人放火搶刧之行爲。」</p>
<p>苦口婆心</p>
<p>〔合衆社新德里十日電〕甘地今日宣稱，由於德里之種族鬥爭，渠已展緩本哲布之行，並將長住德里，「至其回復原狀爲止」。甘地稱，「余必須對印度首都適用「行動或死亡」之老公式，就本人言，務必盡我的一份力量，以平殂此等瘋狂的空氣。渠向「從事無意義之謀殺縱火及搶刧」之輩，呼籲放下屠刀，如不給新政府以「重整秩序之機會」，等於「犯罪性之自殺」　？</p>
<p>德里戒嚴</p>
<p>〔合衆社新德里十日電〕正當新德里混亂區全體士兵接獲「格殺不論」命令之際，年高德邁之和平大師甘地，十日晤見蒙巴頓總督，討論種族仇殺情形，並共商防止暴行之對策。甘蒙二人晤談時，德里地區司令長官辛傳禮少將下令歷下官兵，以任何代價恢復秩序。九日城中之混亂較八日之大屠殺顯然减退，然一回敎堂仍被縱火，戒嚴令因之立即恢復。德里行政長官下令，禁止佩劍，携帶武器及棍棒。內閣緊急事態委負會頒佈公報，下令在火車乘客身上搜査武器。</p>
<h3>猶人英兵發生激戰　猶難民千五百名　拒絕在漢堡登陸</h3>
<p>〔路透社漢堡九日電〕英船「倫尼梅特派克」號所載第三批猶太難民一千五百名今日在此登陸時，曾與徒手英兵激戰一小時半之久。當英兵進入船艙時，並未使用棍棒，及至戰鬥趨於普遍後，英兵始使用棍棒。消防隊之高壓水管，曾被用以澆射艙內之猶太人。婦女及兒童亦均奮力抵抗，較男子猶爲勇猛。猶太領袖昨竟夜在船上召集會議，今晨並舉行宗敎儀式。戰鬥時猶人均高唱猶太國歌。在下令登陸前英軍長官曾給予猶人以兩小時之時間，使其自動登陸，猶人不理，始調軍隊入艙，迫其離開船隻。</p>

<h3>法官投票認定有罪宣判馬萊終身監禁　民事部份被突破口人家屬在交涉中　要求賠償六億收回金條</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍事法庭昨經五小時之秘密會商後，判決馬萊無期徒刑，並罰作苦役終身，長達九日之審判遂告結束。此項判決將送呈美軍事顧問團團長魯克斯將軍審核，魯氏有權同意此項判決，亦有權將判刑减輕，但不能加重·馬萊苦役之地點，亦可由魯氏決定。昨晨九時開庭後，檢察官以二十分鏡之時間，列舉法律條文，說明馬萊之罪狀。被告辯護人起而聲辯，謂余盛孝之諜殺案並非同謀（Conspiracy），判罪只能限於一人。却利供詞之前後矛盾，實爲馬萊無罪之最好證明云云。辦論至此，主審官宣佈辯論終結，全體怯官退入休息室，舉行馬萊是否有罪之秘密投票。自上午九時半至十二時五分，帕爾謨上校宣有午後一時再開。</p>
<p>法官一再秘密會商</p>
<p>午後準時開庭後，復作二十分鐘之秘密會商，法官復座後，即請檢察官宣續被告之履歷及其過去犯罪情形。宣讀畢，法官復經長達一小時之秘密會商，至二時二十分始重新開庭，由主審官帕爾謨上校宣談判詞，馬萊及被告辯議人均肅立靜聽。判詞謂馬萊犯謀殺罪被控，經全體泆官中三分之二以上之多數，　定其有罪，並以四分之三之多數，判定其應受終身監禁並終身苦役之處罰。</p>
<h3>被告聞判強作鎮定</h3>
<p>馬萊聆判時，可色紅脹，下頗外伸，力作英勇鎭定之態，但由其面部之呆滯表情不難看出其內心之痛苦。馮萊十八歲即犯持械搶刧罪，入獄至一九四五年始獲釋放。又判終身監禁之罪，此生殆將長以牢獄爲家矣。怯庭判決後，被害人家屬律師何海晏對記者表示：此案之民事部份，爲被害人家屬要求馬業來及却利兩人共同賠償死者家屬之生活費及子女激養費的六億元，並要求收回五根金條。</p>
<p>馬萊部份賠償向美軍交涉中</p>
<p>其中關於馬萊之部份，正向美軍賠償委員會交涉，惟委員會有權決定之最高數額僅爲五千美金，過此則需移至華府辦理，時間可能延畏至兩年以上。甚吩賠償委員會能將支付之限額設法提高。或以其他方法變通辦理。因死者尚遺下寡婦一人孤兒三人，生活無着，基於人類之同情心，於情於理，固當如此也。至於却利方面，在滬之財產情形，尚待調查，但同謀殺人，自當責成其儘最賠償云。，</p>

<h3>濬浦局臨時工人　停工請願求增待遇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海浴浦局五百餘臨時工，爲要求增加待遇，昨日全體停工、下午集合三查餘人至社會局請願。據稱：該局除五百餘臨時工外，另有四十餘長工。長工之薪水按生活指數計算，短工薪水四月前每工爲三萬元，最近工人要求增加，經調整爲三萬五千元，仍不能維持生活。短工因鑒於薪水與長工相差甚遠，故要求亦依生活指數計算，爲局方拒絕，爰呈請社會局予以援助云云。社會局因濬浦局係屬國營機構，該項糾紛未便進行調解，當時該項請願呈文轉送濬浦局請自行處理速謀解決，三百名請願工人因未獲結果，又因多數係自高橋及吳淞來滬，不及趕返，經商得社會局勞工處長沈鼎同意，昨晚全體住宿於社會局廣塲前。並定今日績向市政府，市參議會，總工會等處請願。</p>
<h3>市府明年總預算昨誶決編製標凖　生活補助凖備金改爲千二百億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府爲商討明年度總預算，於昨午三時，在會議室召開會議，出席有各局處長，由吳市長生席，主席表示明年度之預算，務必量入爲出以不超過明年度市府之可能收入額九千八百三十餘億爲原則。因中央旣無法補貼，市府收入有限，故各局務必將預算再度核减，於最短期間，交會計處彙齊後，提參議會大　通過之。；</p>
<p>記者於會後走訪會計處長閔湘帆，據稱：會間決定編製預算之禁準，爲經常費按照目前之人員及現有工作開支爲依據。臨時費（新興事業費）則以按照三十六年度總預算之二倍爲標準。依此比例估計，明年度預算，當以工務局佔首位，公用，警察，教育等局次之。又根據市府原來規定在明年度總收入九千餘億中，保留一千八百億作爲調整生活補助費準備金，昨日會中，皆認爲此項保留數額過大，決將其减爲一千二百億。因此剩餘之六百億元，將再行分配各局，其比例如下：公用局三三〇億，工務局一八〇億，警察局八四億，社會局三六億，衛生局四十億，地政局三十億。</p>
<h3>工務局長　搖首長嘆</h3>
<p>記者往訪時，工務局長趙祖康正爲預算問題，與閔處長激論。趙局長表示預算過少，一切工程將無法進行，閔處長則表示市府已盡最大努力，實已無法可想。趙局長並曾向記者搖首長嘆謂；工程原料漲十倍，預算祗准漲三倍，明年工作將如何進行。</p>

<h3>漢奸善變　法綱難逃　吳埀瑩經告發扣押　李士羣義子無錫僞警局長勝利後任漁市塲運輸股長</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕敵僞時期歷任偽方要職，作惡多端，勝利以後，搖身一變，現爲滬市漁市塲運輸股股長及義務警察總隊督導主任之漏網漢奸吳垂瑩，（原名義賡，一名義耕，見圖）近經告發，淞滬警備司令部於十日上午派員將該犯於楊樹浦漁市塲其辦公處逮捕，現暫押於警備部看守所，即將移送高檢處法辦。該犯爲本市江灣人，戰前任本市保衛第二團團長，名吳義賡。抗戰爆發，更名垂瑩投僞，任僞無錫縣警察局局長，及僞七十六號特工總部特工人員訓練班之少將副主任等職。（七十六號惡魔李逆士翠兼該班主任，吳曾認李爲義父。）所訓練之人員，在所謂「淸鄉地區，」爲日軍作引路等工作，無錫一帶之人民對吳均恨之入骨。民卅年，現任警備部督察處長之路鵬，（別號大達）奉命潛入敵後，從事反間諜工作，於是年十月卅日，即會一度爲吳逮捕。吳接受僞命，出任僞官後，作惡多端，逮捕政府地下工作人員。詎勝利以後，吳以其搜括得來之鉅額金銀，奔走活動，竟得逍遙法外。吳又以義耕之名，於漁市塲任運輸股股長之職，並任義務警察總隊之督導主任。路鵬爲伸張正義，乃於最近以被害人之身份，具呈宣鐵吾司令告發吳之罪行，經宣氏批准，爲防激犯逃匿計，派社偵組副組長相强偉率領幹員於十日上午將該犯逮捕。該犯當時着香港衫，並無抵抗，僅謂欲返家取衣。經拒絕後，隨稽查人員乘吉普車至司令部看守所暫押。據悉：於看守所內雖强作鎭定，但無法掩露其惶恐之心情。其隨身携有若干所謂證明文件、似預知「東窗事發」者然。</p>

<p>本報爲了擴大「讀者助學金」徽集捐款的效能，我們發動了「特別勸募隊」，深入了社會的各階層去勸募捐款，參加特別勸募隊的單位，有銀行，有廣告公司，也有普通公司商號，許多商業團體的熱忱協助，我們希望勸募工作，能够得到廣泛的展開，但是這種「特別勸募隊」，如果得不到熱心讀者的擁護和支特，是不會得到滿意的效果的一。現在我們在這裏謹以至誠，向愛護我們的讀者呼翻，希望能够對「特別勸募隊」賦予最大的擁戴和推動，以冀早日達到預期的十億元的目標。</p>

<h3>淄博礦區踏勘　輕金屬工廠　東亞首屈一指</h3>
<p>〔本報張店五日航訊〕在由淄博區回張店，途經南定（淄川馬）時，我會參觀了這被日寇譽爲在東亞首屈一指的輕金馬工廠。</p>
<p>這個工廠正式開工於卅二年卡月，當時日寇定名爲「華北　土公司張店輕金屬工廠」。僅鋁的蘊藏量，據估計在王村有二千萬噸，湖田五千萬噸，其餘各地不計其數，而其食量則又高至百分之四十五至百分之七十五，無怪日寇要讚不絕口的說：「山東鋁鑛無盡廠」了。</p>
<p>日本本國因產鋁過少，不敷戰時大量消耗，故自卅二年十月在南定正式築廠後，最初計劃七年完成，繼改爲五年，再改爲三年，最後又以全副精神，突擊方式改爲一年半，至卅四年五月，卒完成計劃中五個鍋爐的第一個，先行開工，正式製鋁。</p>
<p>在正式修築同時，日寇在天津張店兩地招募了高小及初中畢業生共八百名赴日受訓，爲期八月，至卅四年春，學成歸國，作爲該廠基本亦即低級技術及管理人員，至於中級職員，則由台灣人担任，高級的爲日人，直到卅四年八月日寇</p>
<p>投降前夕　在該廠繼續　担任修築其餘四個鍋爐工程的員工即達三萬五千人，當時由張店經南定淄川至博山，空中是高壓電綫及電話重車電燈綫，地下是鐵路，公路，電車路，輕便鐵路，縱橫交义，猶如天羅地網，蔚爲奇觀。據當時在該地從事地下工作現任魯省參議員耿占元先生語記者：該廠東西兩廠連同住宅警衛等區，其面積共達五平方公里，內中廿四個倉庫計存五馬力至二百馬力電器器材二千五百部，庫藏雜糧五千噸，麵粉一萬噸，布五萬疋，所有興築該廠</p>
<p>需用機器幾已全部運到，但至卅四年八月廿一日日軍投降，同月廿三日共匪入侵，駐守之日軍千五百人不戰而退，共匪乃趁機將所存糧劊麫，布，及可以遝走機件，搶劫一空。共匪佔據十八天，至九月十四日，日軍在政府命令下將該廠收復，經濟部乃派時在西河悅昇煤礦任工程師之韓炳鐸爲代表與該廠小田廠長辦理「刧」收，韓要小田重造原始淸册，以多報少，小田當時嘗雙目垂淚地說：「不改對不起朋友，改了又對不起國家」。</p>
<p>韓「刧」收後，即由國軍地方團隊担任守衛，地方團隊在戰時向無固定經費而多就地征糧，工廠旣無糧可征，乃就拆賣廠內東西過日子，當時據耿氏談，僅碱料一項，原存千噸，至卅五年一月十三日停戰令下時，已只剩二三百噸了！</p>
<p>三十五年一月十三日，匪不顧停戰協定，作第二次侵佔，將韓炳鐸俘而殺之。至三十五年七月十一日比第二次撤退前，又將重要可運機件鋼鐵材料及一切家具等由張博支綫經八陡改以汽車南運沂蒙山區。</p>
<p>三十五年七月十一日，國軍二次恢復淄博，國軍七十三軍乃派兵一營駐守南定，同時資委會成立山東鋁業公司，由阮某負責接收。</p>
<p>一度開工　用工人百名，開始整理內部，惟未及一月，又行停工，原因是資委會不拿錢出來員工生活成問題，停工後乃改派張某保管，於是一部份機器馬達零星器材等又出了「後門一。本年二月廿三日，共匪三度入侵，保管人員退駐濟南，至八月十七日國軍三度收復，迄今半月有餘，尚未見資委會派人前往接管，該地國軍未派正規部隊駐守，亦未見資委會要朮加派，記者前往參觀時，只見破屋頹樓，殘機敗件，觸目皆是，而野草蔓生，高可沒膝，尤顯出一片荒凉景象。記者等往參觀前，原已請由張店駐軍</p>
<p>派兵一連在　附近佈防，與記者隨行作獲衛者復有兵一排，初未料於記者等正參觀至中途時，廠區南部忽傳來密集槍聲，心知內中必潛伏有共匪土八路，無奈，只得于倉猝間中途退出，在嚴密警戒下馳車至張店。</p>
<p>過去該廠廠長小田嘗語人，該廠建築及設備費共達三百億日元，而此項廠碱，已由日方列入作戰債賠償，但目下所殘存機器，據耿氏云，已僅剩十分之二。同行某君爲此嘗不勝感慨地語記者：「拉鐵摩爾嘗謂：「中國在抗戰中所獲勝利成果，將在以後的若干戰爭中趨于毀減。」今天參觀了東亞第一輕金屬工廠，無形中正證實了拉氏這句預言，而毀減中國勝利成果的不是別人，而正是中國共產黨人。」（特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>港華貿易窒息期　來了新玩兒　通天輸入證</h3>
<p>〔本報香港五日航訊〕籠罩在一片愁靈慘霧裏的香港貿易市塲，自從八月十七日政府公佈了「中央銀行管理外匯辦怯」的修正案，和「進出口滬易辦法」的修正案以後，非但沒有得到一點實惠，反因結應辦法燮更，把出口重心也連帶由香港轉移到上海去了。</p>
<p>香港商人正在徬徨失措的時候，忽然在無意之中，九龍關來了一個「通天輸入證」的新花樣。辦法是這樣的：海關特准由華南各地載運牲畜，家禽，魚鮮，菜蔬，蛋類等貨來港，同時准在港採辦附表二及附表三（甲）類貨物（汽車及影片除外）入口，憑該證經九龍關各卡所時，可以查騐放行，無須領輸入許可證，自八月廿三日起實行。</p>
<p>爲什麼九龍關會來這個新花樣呢？有人說是港華經濟合作協定的交換條件之一，香港政府允許協助我國海關緝私，中國海關允許由廣州輪入香港所急需的食品。但是港華經濟合作協定旣然難產，何以單獨先實行這一條，不無疑問。另一說是中國海關鑒於港華貿易奄奄一息，走私日益猖獗，想試用這種新辦法來益底抽薪。</p>
<p>不管動機如何，「通天輪入證」的確給予香港市塲一個很大的興奮，它立刻成爲大家搶着收購的有價證券，而且每天有行市，最初是比原額高四成，現在已漲到六成了。廣東商人以利之所在，不惜大量搜購牲畜，家禽，蔬菜，魚鮮，蛋類來港，其中尤以牲畜爲大宗，近來香港牲畜供過於求，價格猛跌，商人在貨價上都吃了大虧，好在「通天輸入證」奇貨可居，貨價上所虧蝕的，還可以從另一方面撈回來。</p>
<p>「通天輸入證」並不是法定的名詞，按其性質，也不是可以「通天」的。它有下面的許多限制：（一）回頭貨物，紙以運逹廣州爲限，（二）所有貨物，到廣州後不准轉口；（三）數目零星，大數難購；（四）進出祗在大鏡關一處，該處規定二百噸以下的船隻可以來往，所以運往廣州的貨物，不能交大輪船輸送，風險較大。</p>
<p>這個新花樣究竟試辦多久，尚無明文規定，但一般預測，這祇是一個臨時變通辦法，給窒息了的港華商人透一口氣，將來香港的食品輸入過多，商人的虧蝕，到了不能從「通天輸入證」上取償以後，這個辦法，自動的會失去了作用而中止。我們且瞧着吧！（特約記者程志政）</p>

<h3>米業公會理鹽事討論　組織聯運公司問題　決定擬具意見候吳主委核辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）上海市民食調配委員會値此新榖登塲之際，爲謀充實本市糧食存底，擬設立儲運處，並委託米商組織聯運公司向產區大量收購食米來滬儲存，以備不時之需，俾使糧價維持正常。聯運公司資金暫定五十億，必要時政府可貸款一百億。吳主任委員開先爲此曾於前日召集米商微詢意見。米商業同紫公會乃於昨日卞午三時召開理監事會議。出席瞿振華，徐頌仁，胡文安，査寳三等二十餘人，由萬　林任主席、對組織聯運公司問題討論甚爲熱烈，有人贊成亦有人反對。反對者所持之理由爲聯運公司成立後，米價是否有把握能使平定？且大量向產區搜購食米來滬，幽能刺激米價，是時設米價上漲，能否担保社會一般與論討米商之攻撃能爲緩和？經詳密商討後，決定先由公會擬是對此問題之意見盡及聯運公司組織章程呈民食調配會，待主任委員吳開先自克返滬後再作決定。席間對　賽聯運公司資金五十億一點，則一致認爲米商無力負担。會議至六時半始散，據萬墨林與記者談。米商在過去經騐已多，如舉辦糧貸未有成就，反使本市米商飽受驚慌。待張嘉璈氏主持中央銀行後，已數度欲米商協助平抑米價，並提出可允米商將食米向政府八折抵押貸款，米商未曾應允。現當局又欲委託籌組聯運公司，米商對此尙須愼重攷慮。</p>

<h3>經部注意麵粉漲價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四區麵粉工業同業公會，九日接獲市社會局轉到市政府四日訓令，略謂：案准糧食部電開：「査上海連日麵粉食米價格上漲，在茲食米轉口，須報經本部核准，而小麥且禁止出口，價格穩定，麵粉採取限額報運轉口期間，麵粉漲價，殊爲不應有之現象，特電請督促各大麵粉廠大量拋售，並監視市塲，取締競爭囤購，平穩糧價，一面疏導食米來源，以資平抑。「聞四區麵粉公會決遵令辦理云。</p>

<h3>秋蘭收購價格一百零八萬元　政院覆電照准</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十日電〕張羣爲顧念蠶農生計，頃將本年江浙秋繭收購價格核定爲每市担一百零八萬元，以示體恤。聞政院即將電知四聯總處飭主管行局，遵照新訂價貸放。</p>
<h3>中農初步決定秋蘭貸欵數額</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行十日已將本年度江浙兩省各地秋繭貸款額度，收繭擔數，繭行家數，作初步估計，分配如下：（一）江蘇省貸款總額爲六一四〇，〇八〇萬元，擔數四九·〇二九，繭行一四二至一六四家。包括無錫貸款五·三六七·六〇〇萬元，擔數四二·八〇八，報行一三〇至一四七家，蘇州貸款七七二·四八〇萬元，擔數六·二二一，繭行一二至一七家。（二）浙江省貸款總額爲四九七〇·〇〇〇萬元，擔數四三·四七三，繭行七七至八七家。包括杭州貸款一，九五九·六〇〇萬元，擔數一七·一四六，繭行三五至三八家。嘉興貸款二·五七〇·二〇〇萬元，擔數二二·四九三，繭行三六至四一家，湖州貸款二六三·五二〇萬元·擔數三·一七四，繭行四至五家，嵊縣貸款七六·六八〇萬元，擔數六六〇，繭行二至三家。</p>
<h3>提高貸欵利息　四聯總處今日開會討論</h3>
<p>提高貸款利息，日來又盛囂　上。頃悉此事討論已歷數年之久，近又舊事重提，聞四聯總處今日將提出理事會解決。據有關方面息，我國工業現已逐漸奠定基礎，國家行局低利資金之資助，不爲無功。但其所需貸助之資金，十分之八，來自普通商業行莊，國家行局不過佔十分之二。故其計算生產成本，利息部門，均以商業行莊爲凖。一般生產成本之計算，原料佔百分之五十，工繳百分之四十，開支百分之五，利息以市息計，尙不及百分之五，以國家行局之利息計，則爲百分之一。　工業之生產過程，爲時極短、故提高貸款利息，於生產成本無影響，更不能刺激一般物價。如一般廠商將低利生產成品，囤積不售，其利息自然加高。惟一般貸款者，均爲日用必需品。旣為日用必需品，當有其適當之銷場，不應有囤積情事發生，或將低利資金流入投機之途。</p>
<h3>團體分紅儲蓄　第二期預定四十億</h3>
<p>中央信託局主辦之團體分紅儲蓄存　，第一期二十億元，已告圓滿完全。該局儲蓄處負責人吿記者，第二期數字預定爲四十億元。日來因開辦伊始，存戶雖不甚多。但根據第一期經騐，下旬存戶將較前兩旬必爲踴躍，故本期成績或可能超過預定數字。</p>
<h3>棉紗議價又提高　二十支紗漲起二十萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會之棉紗議價昨日廿支紗改掛一千一百四十萬元，較前又漲廿萬元。其他各支紗，依比例推算調整。</p>

<p>又該公司配售外埠布廠棉紗，原定每月第第週之星期三配售一次，茲改爲每月第二及第四週之星期三，各配一次，每月配二次。</p>
<p>紗價堅俏</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以紡建公司代紡調會配售脾價，又予提高，四二支細紗掛高七十萬，廿支紗高二十萬元，人心頓呈堅昂，市上實需不弱，業外乘機拉抬，是以四二支藍鳳紗哄高至一千九百萬元，比上日續漲六十五萬。其他廿支十六支四二支四十支等粗細紗，一致步升三四十萬至五六十萬元不等。</p>
<p>棉布挺升</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因各地實銷漸見起色，長江路客帮吸胃加强，染廠家添補甚亟，本街門銷轉活，行情抉搖直上。全日做開，以廿支特細布較多，染廠家收進四五百件，價爲四十萬零四千元，比上日步昂七千元。龍頭細布曾高至五十二萬五千，嗣因交易不多，回低至五十一萬七千，軋升九千元。其他各檔細布及漂布府綢斜紋　嘰色布士林布等，一致挺升一二萬元不一。</p>
<h3>六區棉紡公會常務理事開會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會第八十五次常務理事會，於昨日上午十一時起，在該會會議室舉行，由王啓宇主席。當討論要案六起，其中較重要者爲第四案，案由爲全國紗廠聯合會第二屆會員大會，召開在即，本會擬就提案二件，爲自紡紗支之織成品，不應課征營業稅，及機單貼花按寄存單據每件（即每張）貼用五百元，請大會籲請財部鑒賜核准提案，全文請予審核案。議決：請程敬堂負實審核後，再提會討論。</p>

<h3>統債再跌外股續升</h3>
<p>公債昨跌勢再勁，二三〇室五三八室大成新雖進，五五〇室等均售，統丙自一四〇〇〇一，後步降至一二九〇〇元結束。結果較前收計甲乙跌八〇〇元，統丙跌落七〇〇元，統丁挫一一〇〇元，統戊亦降九〇〇元，成交不過五百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨買風仍見發動，小型股之漲勢，亦依然有力，猶太帮有供，廣帮進而復出，證券帮散戶俱買。怡紗晨開九二八〇〇元，低價九二二〇〇元，高價九三八〇〇元，午刻在九三〇〇〇元左右徘徊。結果較前收計祥泰漲起一成弱，業廣紙業鋼業升半成，餘股咸吿微漲。</p>

<h3>戰後二年的太平洋</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈譯</p>
<p>（譯者按）本文作者鮑勃·白魯姆柏，爲美國戰地記者，太平洋戰爭期間曾隨軍遍歷各島，戰後二年重遊斯地，感慨良多，而作本文。</p>
<p>我最近自太平洋三萬哩的旅程中歸來，這是一次幽靈似的旅行。曾經在太平洋担任過戰地記者的我，原以爲極熟悉那無際的天藍色海水，但我錯了，我竟不能尋到那的界石，韋克島的墓地，我吏在冲繩島上迷路了，沒有一處能够準確地找到，潮水和叢林都使我糢糊，我感到了孤獨，我疑問我能否把自己帶離這塊地方，下面是我在太平洋前哨所見所聞：</p>
<p>珍珠港（Pearl　Harbor：我們在星期日到逹火奴魯魯——一個平靜得正如珍珠港日（日機愉褻的一天）的星期日，我們珍藏着一張照片，那是紊亂的珍殊港，船體都冒着烟火，陸地上沒有人能够作緊急的措施；現在港口中靜靜地停着五百餘艘戰艦，與照片中同一地點，一驅逐艦正緩駛着巡邏海面，「中國號」停泊在港邊。岸上只有三三兩兩的軍用車輛，一切顫示平靜，這鑽石似的城市已漸漸地回復到戰前的節奏。</p>
<p>塔拉瓦（Jarawa）：三日以後，我們的飛機在塔拉瓦着陸，在島上一角，我發現那裏過去是瓦礫焦土，屍體遍地，簡直不堪入目；今日此地已大爲改觀，官員們閒步海濱，充滿着和平快樂的景象，只有一輛日本戰車半沒在海灘邊。塔拉瓦一部的荒凉依舊可畏，這是我們所接觸的僅有需要借以援手的島嶼。幾株新裁的棕櫚算是替代了被戰爭破壞的幾棵。</p>
<p>塞班島（Saipan）：我們發現這裏是太平洋中的樂園，我曾純在此地的機塲中目覩B－29機的升降；今日重遊，覺面目全非，它巳不再成爲攻擊日本的基地，更看不見大隊的飛機，除了幾個橡皮輪胎外，不能發現戰爭的痕跡，塞班岛已很快地建設起來。</p>
<p>關島（Guam）：在戰時，這是美日兩軍「捉迷藏」的所在地，碉堡和山洞現已開聲成康莊的公路，吉普行駛無間。在日輩佔領期內，只有二萬四千個關島居民倖能生存，他們現在軍政府的監督下·勤勞地從事關島的復興，把它發展成太平洋中的新珍珠港。</p>
<p>馬尼刺（Manila）：在戰爭中破壞得最慘酷的要算馬尼刺了，但戰後復興也相當快，雖然百分之六十仍是廢墟，可是大規榜的建設計劃已經開始。菲列濱人覺得，他們在戰時與美軍駢肩作戰，犠牲最烈，應該在戰後得到美國最大的援助。</p>
<p>冲趣：這一個作戰最猛烈的島嶼，差不多步步爲營，每一尺土地均經作殊死戰，即使一座破碎的教堂也是如此；當我第二次來到此地，激堂還未能完全恢復舊觀，一個美國兵對我說這裏沒有使人抑鬱的地方。</p>
<p>東京：日本的首都顯然地有一個極大的變化，我曾經與其他新聞記者在佔領軍未到達時先入東京，那時，我們所得的印象是紊亂，荒蕪和沒有秩序；這次我又來東京，在一高廈上俯瞰全市，進人我限　的是新式的建築，整齊的街通，美麗的花園，今日東東在文化上的發展已臻最高半了，維能施出戰時東京曾經飽受無數的炸蟬！我在東京街頭看見美軍出賣紀念物，也看見美國憲兵和日本警察共同指揮交通。</p>
<p>廣島：我們旅程的終點是廣島，我淸楚地記得在原子彈降落後不久進入廣島的情景，倖存者求生掙扎的面孔，一個老婦在破瓦頹垣中掘掏雜物，像一顆禿了的樹一個死城。廣島的轉變太使我驚奇，五萬餘幢房屋已建築起來，電車和公共汽車已行駛市內，廣岛已完全恢復了活力。我問一個老者爲什麼到廣島來，他說：「這是我的家。」對，每個人有他的家，我於是也匆匆地給束了這次太平洋的長途旅行。</p>
<p>（九三勝利紀念日譯畢）</p>
<p>纙者按：戰後二年太平洋的現狀，是値使人感慨的。尤其是東京和廣島二地，她給予我們的啟示性十分濃郁。人家已經邁步向前，我們必須迎頭趕上。</p>
<h3>盂半盆會</h3>
<p>— （錄自光緒十九年八月卅一日本報）</p>
<p>歷七月，是鬼的月令，許多里弄中又在舉行一年一度的孟闌盆會了。現今是這樣，在五十年前，當然格外被人重視。</p>
<p>「本埠水姻袋業，於前日舉行閑盆勝會，晚間排齊全副執事，遊行各處。有五色龍燈一條，鱗甲如生：牌燈數對，光明四射；抬擱一座，扮成故事：採運船一艘，清歌互答，如遊西子湖頭。逍遙扇十頂，萬民旗數面，凉傘八柄，中燃蠟炬，恍疑不夜城開。殿以僧通數名，內大東門大術，益慶橋廟東等處繞行一周，始回公所。當行至小東門內時，有從人等沿途焚化冥　。忽有甲乙兩丐，飛奔而來，爭奪錠灰，甲力大如牛，不准乙攫取。乙向之責問，田　　擦掌，屢批其頰，致乙口流鮮血，當即倒地，大呼救命。行人駐足觀者，莫明其故，詢問何爲？乙歷告前情，有某丙代抱不平，向前迫趕，甲已毫無踪影矣。」</p>
<p>夫闌盆會，原是迷倌舉動，耗財費力，爲數不少。五十年前之中國，科學不昌，作此舉止，還有可說，而正人君子，尚有不取。現今處於十九批紀之五十年代，原子能巳開始應用，尚作此迷信之舉動，其愚莫甚於此。况現今烽烟未息，瓦爍未復，又復水災嚴重，吏不宜以有用之金錢，作此種無爲之舉動。（本報資料室輯）</p>

<h3>冰上的理想國</h3>
<p>— 明森</p>
<p>人們老是在夢想世界上有這麼一個「烏托邦」，其中沒有軍隊，沒有要塞，沒者失業，沒有文盲，沒有飢寒，沒有罪犯。唔，世界上確有這樣一個地方的，且已存在了若干時候。</p>
<p>這地方名時「冰島共和國」。它沒有海陸空軍或任何軍事機關；每一個人都有職榮；它的預算是平衡的；每一個成年男女和學齡兒童都會讀習寫字。</p>
<p>如果說這島國裏沒有罪犯，也許不十分正確。小小的盜竊家有時要發生的，但煩惱其他國家的重大罪案却絕無僅有。冰島的最近一件殺人案發生於一九二八年。一個小偸殺死了事主。至今時隔二十年，人們還在談論這事。</p>
<p>對於這個國家的當足，如還有什麼疑義，試想這一事實：現在世界上只有冰島一國不在向美國請求貸款。二次大戰時，駐紥在該國的美軍，據說找不到一個「吉普女郎」來共盤桓。</p>
<p>也許出乎你的意外，冰島的氣候是相當溫和的。雖然它高踞在北極圈上，有時要被浮冰和冰河包圍着，它的沿海却有「墨西哥澎流」的喛潮流過。所以，它的冬季是跟美國的費城差不多。它的夏季——六·七·八·三月——寒暑表有時会昇至七十幾度。它的常年平均溢度是三十九度四。</p>
<p>可是冰島有一點確很奇特：由於它的位置太偏在北方了，它的冬季幾乎全是黑夜，它的夏季全是白晝。在夏季，冰島人是依照着時鐘——不是隨着天黑而睡覺的，因爲晚上亮得跟早晨一樣，在仲冬，一天二十四小時中間只有四個鐘頭左右是天亮的。</p>
<p>許多人以爲冰島上的大部分居民，是住在積州雪下冰屋裏的原始愛斯基摩人，其實，非但現在不如此，就是以前也從未如此。在公元第九世紀初，有些愛爾闌的修道士來到島上，以逃避們本國的俗氣。約莫七八十年以後，斯堪的維亞半島上的冒險家開始來到冰島。最先成家立業於那邊的，是一個挪咸入，名呌殷古爾夫，阿拿爾孫。他隨身帶着他建築住宅的棟柱；一望見了冰島，他就把它們拋在海裏，說是要卜居在它們漂上岸去的地點。他後來稱他建立家宅的地方爲「雷克雅維克」，就是今日的冰島首都所在地，現有人口四萬八千。</p>
<p>隨着阿拿頒孫而移居該島的人是這麼多，不出六十年，可居之地都住滿了人。實在，那邊擁擠得使那些愛爾蘭修道士覺得太熱閙了，以致放棄了冰岛。現在的冰島人是白虜金髪碧眼，體格很魁梧的，可以冒充美國中西部的人。</p>
<p>捕魚是冰島人主要的生活因素。它的海一義充滿着鯊魚·靑魚·蟹魚·比自魚·　魚·甚至於鯨魚。有一個時候，冰島曾爲世界最大漁業國之一；雖然它的船隻在戰時被毁壞了許多，它仍在希望恢復它以前的優越地位。它的兩大工業州是製煉魚汕和魚肉。</p>
<p>冰島人多麼愛好學問，可在這事實上看出來：出身冰局的人約有三萬名住在美國和加拿大境內——因爲這些地方用知識來謀生的機會比在冰島更多——這些人幾乎全是「自由職業者」，例如醫生。律師。教員……。</p>
<p>啓：「出版界」展延一天。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>徐　園</p>
<p>美國人造房子，有許多是不請教木匠或泥水匠的，但他們本身並不經營木匠作或泥水作，木匠或泥水匠在美國的工資相當高，所以一般人都不願意去勞他們的駕，寗可自己動手，在美國造房子並不是一件難事，圖樣都是現成的，祗須在建築雜誌上選一所合意的，然後到材料公司去酊材料，門框窗戶，屋頂地板，都有現貨可買，尺寸是一定的，呌一部貨車把現成材料搬回來，按照現成圖樣及說明書裝配起來，這裏敲一鎚，那裏加一釘·一所四五間的小平房，在三四天之內就搭造好了，再打一個電話到傢具公司，一會兒全堂倞其連同鏡框都運來了，如果再要節省的話，可買毛坯傢具，自己加漆，這種毛坯傢具，比漆好一的便宜一倍有餘，小號笠屜樹才賣九塊錢，而且毛坯傢具斑疤較少，可以任選。美國女人除了辦理家務外，空下來穿上工人裝，汕漆地板，粉聖牆壁，揩洗汽車，喂飼牛羊，幾乎無所不精，工作完畢，馬上打扮得花招枝展，　麗欲滴，中國女性有的乎不彈絲，酗酒赌博跳舞交際，樣樣俱精，有的荊釵布裙，完全成爲一個老媽子型，却很少有彈性的，一個標準的女性應該是高貴太太和神聖勞工合而爲一，出去是貴婦，居家是賢妻，晚上是倘侶，我不贊成希特勒的「女子回廚房去」，却主張她們常常往廚房走走，不要天天上館子吃飯，上無塲喝茶。（五十）</p>
<h3>救救交通</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>軍輛「交」織路不「通」，</p>
<p>爭光恐後亂烘烘；</p>
<p>路人看作如蟻命，</p>
<p>「救救交通」義無窮！</p>
<p>上海的街頭，車輛「交織不通」，祗因爲車輛太多，而偏偏大家「爭先恐後」，「横衝直撞」，視路人連「蟻命都不値」。現在當局舉行「九九交通節」，「九九與救救」諧音，以今日的交通秩序混亂，死於輸下者日必多起，所以「九九交通」，不如說「救救交通」。</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>寄居蟹</h3>
<p>— 周性初</p>
<p>折來馬路旁有出賣「台灣田螺」，索價很昂，每只須五千元，好奇的人都購回飼養，貯在玻璃缸中，加以黄沙，常常換水，　以食物，可以歴久不死，頗魏雅趣。其實牠的大名呌做「寄居蟹」一名寄居蟲，或稱巢螺，又稱螖嬋，俗呼蟹螺。</p>
<p>寄居蟹是海渭最多見而又最有趣的動物。初遊激濱的人，看見水潭裏一樣東西，分明倮個玉黍螺或織紋螺殻的空瑴，忽然伸出一只寄居蟹的腿，晃　而爬去，就歡喜得了不得，也驚奇得了不得，一舊子也忘不了。有　甲的動物，竞要用軟體動物的戴來自衛，誠然很奇異。可是我們一見寄居蟹的尾，就明白牠爲什麼要寄居他物來保護自己的生命了。實在因爲尾巴太軟，太鬆垂，所以須要依賴他物獲衛，用以繁値。</p>
<p>細細概察寄居　，不由你要欽得。牠們旣警惕，而又便捷。雖負有重殼，而行動起來，仍很伶俐。牠們好爭鬥，有時一只竟能强拉別一只出殼，而去佔領。有時牠在那裏等候隣居的朋友，如果日險出殼遠離，牠就不客氣去佔據，縮進瑴的深處，皮口門門　然關閉。那時出去的朋友回來看見了這幕慘劇，也無法可想，只得另謀別聞。牠們在爭鬥時，或和異族對抗時，常失落一肢，或傷壞一肢，這却不要緊，因爲也像許多甲殼動物，到了下次　殼，即改換外皮時，總多少完全的重長再生。</p>
<p>寄居蟹在平時，頭先小心地伸出，露出有柄的限，短而顫震的觸角，（基部帶有平衡器富）和長而活動生姿的觸角。隨後火警顯露，右螯總比左整大得多。再後有二對行路用的長腿，其餘二對短而不露，尾梢有一對像鐮的强勁附肢，扣在借來的殻上，十分緊密。其俆尾部附肢祇偏生在左側。據說雄體有三而小，雌體有四，起始三個張有力，用來挾持已釋出的卵。牠二對腿定得頗快，但是一遇阻礙，立刻縮回，仍如一個螺殼。這反射性的回製的神速，異乎尋常。還有一種動作不當見就是從舊殼竄人新殼。牠找着一個滿意的新居，就要突然遷入，速如閃電。普通寄居蟹一生長大起來時，中間換過多種住所。</p>
<p>寄居蟹受過精的卵，闹着在雌體的第二，三，四的腹肢上的剛毛上，成紫色團，就在那裏發育，不拘時季，孵出來的就是小的自由游泳幼體。雌的跟緊地步出借住的殻，露出身體的一部，而刷落所生的小賽實到水中，須經過四個自由游泳期（水蚤體），中間關着蛻榖過程，然後到一短期奇異雙態相，呌銀灰幼體，這幼髁晝間住在海底上，夜間到海面來游泳。不多幾天，就長齊寄居蟄所有的一切特徵。</p>
<p>寄居蟹能吃許多種類的東西，食欲　宏，幾乎沒有一物不要吃的，牠喜吃動物，不問死活，莫不狂熱地吃下去。有時也吃海藻。大　用來攫食，並送進口去，又送到顎和鰓脚那裏去，鰓脚就撕碎或搗爛那食物，隨後食物通進一個奇異的沙襄內而消化。</p>
<p>關於寄居蟹吃飯事，另有一件奇事，就是常有一種海　蠕蟲呌做「色沙蠶」，伏居在寄居蟹所借來的殼裂隱秘地方，平時不食不動。等到寄居蟹吃飯時，牠鑽出來向前去分澗池口澡落下的碎屑。有些地方的漁人，甚至專為捕「色沙蠶」當鈎餌，用以捕捉「寄居蟹」。</p>

<h3>The Party and Youth League Joint Meeting Broadly Discusses the Two Major Guidelines of Construction and Transformation, and Submits Them for Sorting and Integration into a Concrete Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The two proposals, the Party's New Construction Guidelines and the Party's Transformation Guidelines, were the subject of broad exchanges of views throughout the day of the 10th by the Party and Youth League Joint Meeting. A final sorting was conducted in the Sorting Committee meeting held at 9 p.m. on the 10th, to combine the two proposals into a concrete plan, which can be submitted for discussion on the 11th. The list of members of the Sorting Committee has been drafted by the Presidium and approved by the General Assembly. The 33 members are Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, Liang Hancao, Kang Ze, Xiao Jing, Lai Lian, Huang Shao-gu, Liu Keshu, Wang Qijiang, Hong Lanyou, Yu Jingtang, Gu Zhengding, Li Weiguo, Zheng Yanfen, Jiang Jingguo, Li Junlong, Zhao Zhongrong, Hu Gui, Fang Zhi, Li Yizhong, Pang Jingtang, Yu Junxian, Huang Jilu, Li Xi'en, Li Zheng, Li Shusen, Zhou Shiguang, Ren Jue-wu, Wang Zheng, Liu Hengjing, Xu Suyu, Ren Zhuoyi, Guo Zijun, with Liang Hancao, Huang Shao-gu, and Li Zheng as conveners. The Party's New Construction Guidelines have already been published in this newspaper. The main points of the transformation plan are as follows: (1) Principles: Adopt a democratic centralism system; future development seeks universality and depth, extending to rural areas, factories, mines, and even transportation and production sectors, as well as overseas. (2) Party Members: Revise the standards for party members, eliminate corrupt and malicious elements, rectify the revolutionary ranks, re-register and reorganize members and Youth League members, and, based on democratic principles, complete the organization at all levels within a limited time. A National Congress of the Party will be convened on May 5, 1948, to strictly prevent small factions. (3) Impose strict discipline on party members holding government positions. Those who create or participate in small factions within the party will be expelled from the party. At the same time, party members' property registration will be carried out.</p>
<p>The current political program focuses on the following points: (1) Mobilize the nation to suppress bandits. (2) Actively recover sovereignty over the Northeast and strengthen border defenses. (3) Implement constitutional government as scheduled. (4) Punish corruption severely and thoroughly refresh politics. (5) Improve the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants. (6) Vigorously implement land reform. (7) Restrict currency inflation and prohibit speculation and monopolies, etc.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] President Chiang's written instruction at the Party and Youth League Joint Meeting on the 10th was a speech given to party members at a meeting in late June, a review of the current situation and important decisions. In summary, it recounted the evolution of the communist rebellion since the victory, as well as a comparison of the military strength of the enemy and our forces. The conclusion President Chiang reached in this review was that the Communists' strength lies not in military affairs, nor their advantage in politics, but in the party's organization, discipline, and propaganda. We should recognize this and improve accordingly, so that we can be assured of victory. All military, political, and economic reforms should begin with strengthening the party's organization and concentrating the party's strength. President Chiang also pointed out that the party's immediate task is to unite the party and youth league organizations to increase new strength, and hoped that party members should be responsible to the party and to the revolution, strengthen their revolutionary faith, restore the revolutionary spirit, and be responsible for the party and work hard for the party. At the same time, he encouraged them to firmly follow the path of democratic constitutionalism and complete the task of national construction.</p>
<h3>The Atmosphere at the Meeting Was Solemn and Harmonious, with Committees Speaking Enthusiastically, all Hoping for Active Leadership of the Masses to Eliminate the Scourge of Bandits, and the Youth Movement in Particular Cannot Be Ignored in the Future.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Party and Youth League Joint Meeting was held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:30 this morning, attended by 537 people. President Chiang himself presided. After the Secretariat reported on matters, he read President Chiang's instruction "A Review of the Current Situation and Important Decisions of Our Party." After the reading, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng stood up and reported, stating briefly: The topics of the Fourth Plenary Session and the Party and Youth League Joint Meeting have been decided by the Central Standing Committee as "How to Strengthen the Revolutionary Organization of Our Party, Reform Politics, Complete the Suppression of Rebellion and National Construction, and Carry Out the Tasks of the Late Mr. Deng." In addition to soliciting opinions from comrades of party headquarters and youth league headquarters at all levels, the Party and Youth League Unified Organization Committee has also studied the matter in detail and drafted a draft of the Party's New Construction Guidelines to serve as the basis for discussion. The Central Executive Committee of the Three Principles of the People Youth League has also drafted a draft of the Party's Transformation Guidelines. Comrades of party headquarters and youth league headquarters at all levels have also expressed many opinions on this topic. These are provided to the General Assembly together. Please express your opinions on this matter broadly, provide concrete measures, and appoint a Sorting Committee to summarize and sort them out before submitting them for discussion. At this point, there was a 20-minute break. Then, the discussion proceeded. Deng Wenyi and five others spoke in succession. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn and harmonious.</p>
<p>Deng Wenyi expressed his opinions based on his recent impressions from inspecting bandit areas, believing that in response to the current situation of bandit suppression, the party should re-coordinate in terms of policies, methods, organization, and propaganda in order to achieve the effect of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. The people in the bandit areas have confidence in the party's policies, but believe that implementation is not thorough enough, giving the communists an opportunity to exploit. Deng also revealed the communists' conspiracy to instigate the "three strikes" policy in our rear and proposed countermeasures that we should take.</p>
<p>Li Jinzhang pointed out that the party's organizational training should avoid formality, focus on scientific approaches, strengthen combat focus, especially at the grassroots level, with the focus on approaching the masses and leading the masses. Party internal evaluation and supervision should also be strengthened.</p>
<p>Zhou Zenglin explained that although the Communist Party is very insidious and poisonous, our party has a glorious history, a broad organization, great ideals, and wise leadership. All these superior conditions are beyond the reach of the communists. As long as we cheer up and work hard, the communists are not to be feared. All reforms of the party should start with raising the supervisory power.</p>
<p>Tang Ruyan pointed out that the Communist Party is a highly specialized organization that violates human nature, emphasizing only party discipline and lacking emotion. This is the main reason for its failure. Therefore, he advocated that in the party's organizational program, discipline and emotion must be given equal importance, and the political program should focus on vigorous implementation. At the same time, he suggested adding phrases such as "share life and death, share weal and woe, love the party, and love comrades" to the oath.</p>
<p>Luo Cairong discussed the plans proposed by the Party and Youth League, emphasizing first of all the need to raise the concept of loving the party, with love for the party above all else. The party is the major artery of the country, and the Youth League is like the country's fresh blood. The two complement each other. Luo also advocated that in addition to the organization and political programs, there should be an action program. Party members holding government positions should be strictly assessed, and comrades should be mobilized to participate in battlefield work.</p>
<p>Zhen Tianxi, based on his experience in presiding over school youth league affairs, pointed out that the communists' instigation of student movements is professionalized and specialized, using money to lure students. However, the majority of students have a sense of justice and patriotism. He hoped that respected party and youth league elders, based on their enthusiasm for protecting young people, would personally go to various schools to lecture and guide them, so as to influence the thinking of young people into the right track. The meeting adjourned at 12:05.</p>
<p>The Party and Youth League Joint Meeting continued at 3:00 p.m., still presided over by President Chiang. Representatives broadly exchanged views on the "Draft of the Party's New Construction Guidelines" and the "Draft of the Party's Transformation Guidelines." The speakers and their main points are recorded below: Wang Zhiyuan reviewed the content of the plan, believing that school party affairs should be strengthened, and the glorious history of the party should be promoted. The goal of saving the country and the people with the Three Principles of the People will surely win the support of young people.</p>
<p>Feng Yunxian especially called the attention of the General Assembly to the border issue, strengthening the border party headquarters, and actively leading the women's movement.</p>
<p>Zang Jianxin expressed concern that the instability of the social economy easily causes the depression of young people. He hoped that the party's elders would actively lead, so that young people would have something to rely on.</p>
<p>Chen Xueping believed that the failure to mention the youth issue in the party's program was a major regret. Students and young people are dissatisfied with the status quo due to insufficient school facilities and the general inability of the society to accommodate them. We must try our best to solve some of the difficulties encountered by young people. Special care must be given to young students who have escaped from the communist areas to prevent them from being used by other parties. As for some liberal professors, we cannot immediately consider their thinking to be problematic because their remarks and criticisms are slightly more radical. We must know that their motives for criticism mostly stem from their enthusiasm for protecting the country, and this cannot be considered a crime.</p>
<p>Lin Yongnian advocated that in addition to the party's organization and political programs, there should be an action program. However, this must be pragmatic and self-disciplined, avoiding self-promotion. After the party and youth league are unified, this new party must have a new style when promoting party affairs in the future in order to fight against the current enemy, the communists. We should truly cooperate with the people and first gain the sympathy and belief of the people, and then we can establish the foundation of the party. Therefore, it is essential for party workers to become one with the people.</p>
<p>Xie Renzhao spoke, explaining that what should be paid attention to after the party and government reforms and the unification of the party and the country is how to quickly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. We must move from destruction to construction, and from non-production to production. Therefore, the party must encourage party members to engage in industrial production and complete the mission of national construction as soon as possible. As for the youth movement, it cannot be ignored in the future. He hoped that youth movement committees could be established in some areas in the near future to actively lead the youth.</p>
<p>Han Wenpu believed that after the unification of the party and youth league, special attention should be paid to the following tasks: (1) The people do not hope for the success of the communists, but place deep hopes on the Kuomintang. Today is our opportunity to work hard. (2) We should work hard to serve the people. (3) We should universally manage local government officials. (4) We should assist party members to develop towards agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>Li Manhun reviewed the contents of the two programs and believed that they both ignored the importance of ideological leadership. Therefore, he advocated: (1) Strengthening cultural work, which should be the basis of organization. (2) Absorbing progressive elements who stand on the interests of the country and the nation. We should not consider their thinking to be incorrect and lose the masses because their words are slightly radical. (3) Cultivating creative young people, setting up more scholarships, and actively helping young people pursue further education. Concentrate efforts to create several daily newspapers and periodicals to achieve propaganda effects.</p>
<p>At 4:15, there was a fifteen-minute break, and the meeting continued, presided over by Ju Zheng. Li Yaolin, Deng Feihuang, and others continued to express their opinions.</p>
<p>Li Yaolin said: In order to relieve the people's suffering and complete the mission of national construction, the unification of the party and youth league is necessary to achieve this goal. The party and youth league must understand each other and make concessions to unite forces and eliminate the communists.</p>
<p>Deng Feihuang pointed out that a small number of party members holding government positions have a tendency to leave the party. The central government should strictly control them and involve them in the party's organization. The party's grassroots organization is not sound and needs to be strengthened urgently. At least a few corrupt elements must be eliminated in time to thoroughly transform.</p>
<p>Hu Qiuyuan believed that whether the communists can be eliminated is not only related to the rise and fall of the party, but also determines the survival of the country. Regarding the current situation, Hu advocated thoroughly selecting talents, strengthening internal party management, and taking practical actions to meet the needs of the people.</p>
<p>Guo Zijun advocated improving the quality of grassroots working comrades within the party and determining their position in the party based on their working ability. The policy must be consistent with action, and facts must be used for external propaganda.</p>
<p>Lei Gu called on the General Assembly to pay attention to the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The unrest caused by poverty today can be easily resolved as long as the party works hard to implement the teachings of the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang's instructions. He believed that the party's new construction plan drafted this time should stipulate a time limit in order to be completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>Ren Zhuoxuan believed that there must be a new theory before there can be new actions. He hoped that everyone would pay attention to studying the theory of the later revolution as the basis for the party's transformation. Ren also said that the party should seek development through propaganda and consolidate the party through training. The two should not be biased, but the most fundamental thing is the ideological issue. It is necessary to understand the general psychological state of party members and do the work of setting things right.</p>
<p>Tong Huaizheng, as a representative of peasant comrades, pointed out to the General Assembly that the foundation of the party should be built in the vast rural areas. Today's peasant masses, in the cruel massacres of the communists, are waiting for the assistance and rescue of party comrades. They believe in the Three Principles of the People and support our leader. Strengthening rural work in the future is the most effective way to combat the communists.</p>
<p>Cui Chuiyan advocated strengthening the party's fighting spirit, strengthening the party's grassroots organization to approach the masses, and strictly implementing the party's tasks.</p>
<p>Meng Shufan said: During the current period of bandit suppression, politics should cooperate with military affairs. The party should strengthen propaganda work in the communist areas to make the people understand the central government's concern for them, and strive to eliminate the scourge and carry out the task of construction.</p>
<h3>The Youth Party's National Congress Declaration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The 11th National Congress of the Youth Party opened on the 1st of this month, lasting for nine days, and concluded successfully on the 9th. The party has just released the declaration of the National Congress, which discusses politics, military affairs, diplomacy, economics, and finance. It states briefly:</p>
<p>(1) In terms of politics, we recognize that the current political situation needs to be thoroughly reformed, and it is indeed possible to gradually improve it. The reason why it has become the paralyzed phenomenon of today is partly due to historical inertia and partly due to the defects of the system. Everything measured during and after the war is the main reason for the formation of this paralyzed phenomenon.</p>
<p>The remedy is, first, to adhere to the track of democratic constitutionalism and strive for its gradual implementation. Second, if party ethics are not established, civil morality will not be promoted. In order to establish political and natural norms, it is better to lose trust through fairness and compliance with the law than to succeed through clever plundering. Third, the use of policies is not about covering everything, but about grasping the key points. As for correcting the habit of sluggishness and perfunctoriness and stopping the wind of competition and infighting, this is especially necessary for the current political situation. Fourth, the division of powers and responsibilities between the central and local governments should be based on the provisions of the Constitution. If the central government binds the local government, the autonomy system cannot be established, and the democratic spirit cannot be popularized throughout the country. Fifth, the recruitment of talents should have a fair and generous system, while the cultivation of talents depends on awards and tempering. It is necessary to make the people use their right to vote carefully, the public opinion circles use their right to criticize carefully, political parties can work diligently to train their members, and today's largest party, the Kuomintang, must be able to base itself on fair principles, and for the central political power, especially local political power, enable other parties and non-party people to have the opportunity to participate in actual politics according to the size of their strength.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of military affairs, we have always advocated the nationalization of the military. To realize this principle, we must establish the purpose and system of military education, improve the quality and training of the military, ensure the fairness and universality of conscription obligations, be careful and strict in the promotion of officers, and ensure the reality and openness of military needs distribution. Especially important is the implementation of the separation of military and civilian governance and the determination of the military region system. As for the current measures to mobilize to suppress rebellion, we also recognize that to solve this problem, it is by no means effective to simply place hope on military affairs. If politics is not thoroughly reformed, there is no way to ensure the results of the war.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of diplomacy, our nation respects peace, and its support for the United Nations Charter is clearly stated in it. Therefore, we are willing to befriend all those who are willing to live in peace with us. However, given the closeness of today's international relations, the so-called peace must take ensuring world peace as a prerequisite. As for our reconstruction of Japan, if we can take prohibiting its restoration of arms as a basic condition, we are unwilling to make excessive demands. If its people can continue to display their good habits of diligence and frugality to engage in peaceful and democratic construction, and its economic development does not threaten the future of our country's production, we will not hesitate to restore normal relations with it.</p>
<p>(4) In terms of economics, we advocate that everything should be based on private operation, except for a very small number of heavy industries or transportation enterprises that are beyond the capacity of private power and have a national scope, and some matters that are directly related to national defense. The mode of official-business joint operation is a plot for corruption, and official supervision of business operation is a sin. In the future, it must be thoroughly corrected. In terms of finance, we advocate thoroughly rectifying China's finances. It must start with reforming the monetary system, take increasing production as its foundation, and then set the tax system and rectify discipline for its use. Otherwise, public bonds will be difficult to sell, foreign debts will be difficult to raise, and tax revenue will be a source of water without a source. All the winds of corruption and embezzlement will be enough to promote the collapse of the entire situation. The so-called clean politics will be empty talk, and the so-called balance of payments will become exhausted. (The End)</p>
<h3>Measures for Party Members' Property Registration Designated to be Submitted to the Plenary Session for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] In order to comprehensively understand the living conditions of party members and prevent party members from engaging in corruption and other improper economic behavior, the Kuomintang has decided to conduct property registration for party members. The measures have been drafted and are generally as follows:</p>
<p>Party members should register when they join the party. The registration of leading cadres of the party at all levels, government officials in charge, and persons in charge of state-owned and public-owned enterprises should be particularly detailed. Registration is based on the current social and economic conditions. Party members whose daily income and expenses are sufficient to offset each other and whose property is more than 5,000 yuan before the war are considered to be able to support themselves, and so on. If there are party members who have become particularly wealthy due to past improper behavior and do not participate in property registration, party disciplinary sanctions should be strictly enforced. The measures can be implemented after being passed by the Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Flies to New York Today to Discuss Peace Talks with Japan with Leaders of Various Countries, Arguing that the Peace Treaty Should Receive Universal Support</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 9th] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie is scheduled to fly to New York on the 11th and does not intend to visit Washington before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Wang said at a press conference on the 9th that one of his responsibilities in the United States will be to contact leaders of other countries directly concerned with the Japanese peace talks. He reiterated that "our goal should be a comprehensive peace treaty supported by the public." Wang made this statement in view of the Soviet Union's repeated requests to limit the work of drafting the Japanese peace treaty to the four major powers, rather than being presided over by the eleven member states of the Far Eastern Commission proposed by the United States. Foreign Minister Wang explained that the reason why the Soviet Union adopted this position was that the Soviet Union was afraid that in the meeting of eleven countries, its speech might be extremely ineffective due to the two-thirds majority vote system. As for the compensation in the peace treaty, Wang said that China does not intend to demand anything that would permanently bind Japan. At the same time, he made it clear that China, which has been at war with Japan for the longest time and suffered the most, should receive the largest share of the compensation. In response to the question of the stalemate in Dalian, Wang said that the Soviet Union believes that the war against Japan has not ended, and they still have the right to occupy the port militarily. The Chinese government believes that the war against Japan has ended long ago, and Dalian should belong to China in accordance with reason. He also said that the Soviet Union's interpretation of certain clauses in the Sino-Soviet Treaty would not be accepted by objective people. Wang warned that peace in the Far East depends on faithful adherence to the words and spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, otherwise the situation in the Far East will be very bad. Wang also discussed the Communist Party issue and the allegation by some Americans that the Chinese government made mistakes in distributing UN relief supplies. He believed that there is no possibility of peace talks between the Chinese government and the Communist Party until transportation is restored and the main force of the Communist Party is annihilated. Communism in China is the same as in other countries, if it can establish effective and powerful</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Does Not Participate in the Meeting on Korea, Our Government Expresses Extreme Disappointment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists at 4:30 p.m. on the 10th, presided over by Director General [blank] himself. The Q&amp;A is recorded below:</p>
<p>Q: The suggestion to hold a four-nation conference to discuss the Korean issue has been rejected by the Soviet Union. What is the Chinese government's reaction to this? Has the Chinese government received a formal note from the US government stating that this meeting will be postponed due to the Soviet Union's rejection?</p>
<p>A: The Chinese government feels very disappointed that the Soviet government disagrees with the US's suggestion to convene a four-nation conference. The realization of the unification of Korea is the Chinese government's consistent expectation. In April of this year, the Chinese government suggested that if the two countries occupying Korea cannot agree, the four countries that formed the agreement on Korea established in Moscow in November 1945 should be convened for consultation. For the sake of fairness to the Korean people and for the sake of political stability in the Far East, the Chinese government sincerely hopes that the four countries can still act in unison on the issue of resolving the Korean issue. Regarding the second point inquired in the question, the Chinese government has not received a formal note from the US.</p>
<p>Q: Has the Soviet Union replied to the Chinese government's protest against the Soviet ship "Ilyich" sailing to Shanghai carrying passengers and goods?</p>
<p>A: The Chinese government has not yet received a reply from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Q: Has the Chinese government instructed Foreign Minister Wang to represent China on special matters during the UN General Assembly?</p>
<p>A: I am sorry I cannot answer this question.</p>
<p>Q: If the Soviet Union opposes holding a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, does the Chinese government support holding a peace conference without the presence of the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>A: Regarding this point, Foreign Minister Wang made a very clear statement in Shanghai on the eve of his departure for the United States. I have no other opinions to add besides asking you to refer to that statement.</p>

<h3>Nearly 100 Billion Yuan in Profits from the Allotment and Sale of Yarn and Cloth, Half of which is Allocated to Improve Cotton Production, and 50.9 Billion Yuan is Used as a Development Fund for the Textile Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs said: The total profit from the allotment and sale of yarn and cloth by the former Textile Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs last year was approximately 95.9 billion yuan. In accordance with the original regulations for stabilizing yarn prices, it should be stored in a special government account for the purpose of subsidizing cotton production and developing the textile industry. The distribution method has been decided by the 17th Executive Yuan meeting, with 45 billion yuan allocated to the Cotton Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for the improvement of cotton production. It has been ordered by the office to prepare a production plan for approval and implementation. The remaining 50.9 billion yuan will be used as a development fund for the textile industry. The plan and budget are being prepared by experts designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the "Ministry of Economic Affairs Textile Industry Development Fund Management Committee" is being organized in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan. Relevant institutions and textile industry tycoons are being appointed as members to jointly bear the responsibility of reviewing income and expenditure and investment. How this fund will be distributed and used is yet to be decided. In addition, 16 billion yuan was allocated from the 35th year profit distribution plan of China Textile Corporation as an academic research fund. The distribution method has also been approved by President Zhang, and most of it is for technical research institutions directly or indirectly related to the textile dyeing industry.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan said: Our party has led the revolution and experienced decades of struggle, and has a glorious history. We are confident that this thorough reform of our party from top to bottom, from inside to outside, will be able to exert the greatest effect. If this force is used to promote society, there will be positive development. Pan also emphasized that there are many talented people in the party, but they have not been valued by ordinary comrades, so it is not easy to exert a positive effect.</p>
<p>Li Jingshi pointed out that the separation of the party from the masses is a serious mistake. As long as the party actively leads, it can eliminate the communists who endanger the people.</p>
<p>Fan Xipin said that correcting one's own mistakes is the only way to defeat the enemy. Standing on the position of seeking benefits for the people and eliminating the communists will surely gain the trust of the people, and thus can generate power and complete the unification and construction of the country. After Fan's speech, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting at 6:45.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech at Plenary Session Prominently Published in American Newspapers</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, flew from  to Nanjing at 4:40 PM on the 10th. Zhou Zhirou, Yu Jishi, Lan , and students from the Frontier School in Nanjing were among those who greeted him at the airfield. After disembarking, Zhang returned to his official residence to rest. At 7:00 PM, he was summoned to the Chairman's residence to report on the border situation. Zhang is scheduled to attend the Plenary Session within days to report on the Xinjiang issue and the Beitashan incident.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Zhizhong met with reporters at his residence at 5:00 PM on the 10th and spoke candidly about the border situation. He mentioned that the current situation in Xinjiang is at a standstill, but the government's established peaceful policy will not change. The government will not consider the other side's request to replace Mesut Sabri, as this decision is aimed at "governing with new people and new policies." Zhang also stated that he had presented four demands to the other side on the 1st of this month, which have not yet been answered. It is estimated that the three districts occupied by the other side have a population of only over 800,000 and a military force of only six regiments, totaling 12,000 men. In contrast, our side has a population of over 3 million in seven districts. From this perspective, the other side's demands are unlikely to lead to a further deterioration of the situation. We are currently awaiting their response before making a final decision. When reporters inquired about the recent situation at Beitashan, Zhang said there were only minor skirmishes. He declined to answer questions about the participation of a certain side's aircraft and the nature of the war at Beitashan.</p>

<h3>Minister Bai's Full Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi: This afternoon, at the first meeting of the Fourth Plenary Session, a military report was given, meticulously reviewing "Military Installations," "Implementation of Systems," and "Overview of Bandit Suppression." The full text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A. Preface</p>
<p>Since the communist bandits betrayed the Republic of China, they have successively violated the armistice orders issued by the government, denied the constitution formulated by the national will, exhausted military force, and harbored malicious intentions, aiming to bring the Republic of China to utter ruin. This ministry, following the orders of the Supreme Commander, continues to carry out bandit suppression and pacification, rescuing the people in the bandit-controlled areas, and simultaneously establishing a military system as a grand plan for building the army. Since the government issued the National General Mobilization Order on July 4th, the coordination between our political and military strategies has become closer, and the purpose of military actions has become clearer, allowing policies to be implemented smoothly. After the mobilization order was issued, we entered the stage of "Everything for bandit suppression, everything for victory." The entire nation rose up together, striving forward, and all political and economic measures were focused on achieving victory in bandit suppression. In the military aspect, it is even more appropriate to focus on achieving military victory and the situation of bandit suppression. The future military policy, under the premise of "Bandit Suppression First," includes: First, replenishing the personnel shortages of the front-line corps in a timely manner to maintain regular combat effectiveness; Second, establishing a second-line corps as the general reserve force of the national army, using new forces to achieve victory earlier; Third, improving local self-defense organizations and universally strengthening the organization and training of the masses to ensure military-civilian cooperation, exert comprehensive tactics, and ensure area control; Fourth, in general military and political aspects, emphasizing the establishment and implementation of a modernized military system to lay a foundation for the national army for a century and to ensure national defense security.</p>
<p>In summary, to adapt to the general mobilization and enable military policies to coordinate with the mobilization of all manpower and resources, we will revise plans accordingly and implement them rationally to overcome all difficulties and complete the pacification mission. I will now report on the bandit suppression efforts and related military and political measures over the past six months.</p>
<p>B. Regarding Military and Political Installations</p>
<p>Military and political installations have been . This ministry is continuously implementing them. I will briefly describe the current needs and concerns of the people as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Placement of Demobilized Officers: The placement of demobilized officers was previously implemented according to a predetermined plan. After the mobilization order was issued, all demobilized officers, except those already placed, who could not change careers or were strong in their prime, were retained and stored as supplementary cadres. The general (major) teams of officers have now all been concluded, and the work of placing demobilized officers has also come to an end. I will now describe the past placement situation as follows: 1. The number of demobilized officers totaled approximately 240,000 at the end of the 35th year after the national army reorganization (including approximately 160,000 surplus officers), with approximately 70,000 unemployed, who were received and trained by various officer general (major) teams. 2. The placement of demobilized officers was divided into three types: retention, career change, and retirement (discharge). The original plan was to retain 20,000, transfer 150,000, and retire 15,000. Because the number of surplus personnel increased more than expected, totaling approximately 240,000, and due to the impact of the situation, career changes were difficult. As a result, approximately 70,000 were retained, approximately 55,000 were transferred, and more than 100,000 were retired. 3. The placement of demobilized generals totaled more than 2,500, most of whom were retained, except for those who changed careers or retired. 4. The number of demobilized officers who changed careers totaled more than 50,000.</p>
<p>(2) Adjustment of Officer and Soldier Compensation: Officer and soldier compensation is affected by prices, making it extremely difficult to maintain livelihoods, which directly affects combat and indirectly affects public perception. Although two slight adjustments were made in February and May of this year, due to continuous price increases, officers' lives still could not be improved, and soldiers' lives were even worse. Fortunately, the government adopted measures to equalize civilian and military compensation, adjusting officer and soldier compensation starting in August, with the main points as follows: 1. Officers' base salaries are paid according to the intermediate salary level of civil officials of the same rank, such as a major general being calculated according to the fifth level of simplified appointment, and a captain being calculated according to the intermediate level of the second and third levels of delegated appointment. 2. Soldiers are calculated and increased according to the actual salary amount before the War of Resistance Against Japan, i.e., sergeants are increased by 10,000 times, superior privates by 12,000 times, and first and second class privates by 15,000 times. 3. Because military officers and soldiers are frequently transferred, they are not divided into regions for supply purposes, and compensation in all regions is calculated according to the second region standard for civil servants, i.e., a basic number of 39 million yuan and a base salary of 1,600 times, with higher amounts for the Northeast, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. 4. In the future, when civil servants' compensation is adjusted, military personnel will be adjusted simultaneously in comparison. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Turbulent Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>The Japanese political situation has been in turmoil again in recent months. The Katayama cabinet, in order to ease the opposition party's attacks in the Diet, requested the Diet to postpone its session for two weeks, from September 1st to 14th. During these two weeks, the Japanese political situation did not improve. On the one hand, opposition leader Shigeru Yoshida launched the Liberal Party's executives to travel and give speeches throughout the country, attacking the government in various ways to prepare for a no-confidence vote. On the other hand, incumbent Foreign Minister and Director-General of the Central Liaison Office Hitoshi Ashida suddenly delivered an anti-government speech on the 6th, pointing out that "the Katayama cabinet's policies have run into a wall, the current cabinet has lost the people's trust, and it is time to relinquish power." He also pointed out that Yoshida is currently preparing to form a new party, and if successful, many members of the Democratic Party will defect, and hinted that the new party's new policies are to cope with the Allied countries' peace treaty with Japan, and he is very interested in this matter. Looking at the trend, the opposition party's strength seems very strong, and the current cabinet lineup already has cracks. How Katayama will cope, and how MacArthur will nod, has become the key to the survival of the current cabinet.</p>
<p>The Katayama cabinet was formed on June 1st of this year. Katayama is the leader of the Socialist Party, which became the largest party in the Diet in the April election. According to the Japanese constitution, the prime minister is elected by the Diet, and Katayama won an overwhelming victory, taking over the first cabinet under the new constitution. In order to unite the parties, Katayama attempted to form a four-party coalition government, but failed due to the Liberal Party's lack of cooperation. He then changed course to win over the Democratic Party, and as a result, Ashida joined the government, barely forming a three-party coalition government. However, Katayama's administration over the past three months has relied on the "Four-Party Policy Agreement," expecting the Liberal Party's cooperation. In all fairness, Katayama himself has the breadth and magnanimity of a statesman, and has won general favorable reviews. Katayama appeared as a "progressive," and for the sake of Japan's revival, he has continuously carried out various reforms and constantly sought assistance from the United States. MacArthur has also quite encouraged Katayama's reforms, especially satisfied with the Katayama government's obedient attitude. Logically, the Katayama government should be supported by the people and the opposition parties. However, Katayama has encountered many hidden reefs, the opposition parties' strong anti-government activities, and Ashida's divisive attitude towards the government have already reached a showdown.</p>
<p>The opposition parties oppose the Katayama government for two reasons: First, economically, they believe that the current regime has failed to stabilize Japan's economy. Katayama's socialist-leaning reforms, such as preparing to place coal mines under state control, have been firmly opposed by the private sector. Shigeru Yoshida's Liberal Party has openly expressed opposition, causing many obstacles to Katayama's administration. Second, politically, they believe that the current regime is weak and incompetent, unable to eliminate communist forces domestically and unable to seize the opportunity for a peace treaty with Japan, allowing Japan to obtain a "victory in the peace treaty" under very favorable circumstances, and luckily obtain "equal treatment," "without losing rights or paying compensation." The Liberal Party opposes the Katayama government based on economic and political reasons, obviously to protect Japan's old forces and Japan's militarism, and intends to revive Japan's old forces. Today's Japan still relies on the old forces as its pillar, so the opposition party's activities in the opposition can receive widespread response, and even Hitoshi Ashida has opportunistically echoed them. This is the Katayama government's misfortune, and also the horizontal break of the undercurrent of Japan's conservative forces, reaching a political watershed.</p>
<p>The rise of Japan's conservative forces is not only a misfortune for Japan's democratic politics, but also a misfortune for Japan's future of peace and stability. The new party that Yoshida is brewing to organize is to unite the conservative stubborn forces. They are prepared to use the slogan of striving for "victory in the peace treaty" to overthrow the current government, dominate the next regime, and wait for the completion of the peace treaty before seeking the revival of Japanism. According to a report in the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun on the 4th of this month, former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, former Prime Minister Kijuro Shidehara, Privy Council President Tsuneo Matsudaira, and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Naotake Sato are forming a new party as first-class diplomats before the peace conference, and are obtaining the next regime. Looking at the situation, "new diplomat" Ashida is also infatuated with the activities of the new party. If this new party can really be formed and MacArthur nods in agreement, then the Katayama cabinet will undoubtedly collapse. Yoshida is the mastermind of the conservatives, Shidehara and Matsudaira are not only conservative, but also extremely stubborn, Sato and Ashida were schemers in Japan's war of aggression and should have been listed as war criminals and severely punished, which would not be harsh. But today's Ashida is not satisfied with celebrating his promotion, and is now speculating politically. Sato is engaged in new conspiracies, which is a threat to peace in the Far East. This situation shows that in today's Japan, there is no so-called public opinion to impose sanctions, and MacArthur's leniency and tolerance do not involve the pursuit of war responsibility. If this situation continues to evolve, the conservative forces will inevitably rise further, and Japanese politics will never be bright. Whose fault is this? We would like to hear how the United States judges this.</p>
<p>In short, the turbulent Japanese political situation is the result of the rise of the conservative forces, and is a necessary reflection of the radiation of reactionary forces. Japanese politics has now reached a watershed, and the life and death fate of the Katayama cabinet will be arranged by the reactionary forces and MacArthur. After the Japanese Diet reconvenes, Katayama, with his position as the largest party, should logically be able to safely overcome the difficulties and temporarily prolong his life. After the new party matures, the Katayama government has two paths to take: one is to strive for "victory in the peace treaty" and surrender to the new party; the other is to be困扰 by financial and economic problems and coerced by the reactionary forces, and hand over the regime to the conservatives. Other than that, Katayama seems to have few new paths to follow.</p>

<h3>Bollaert Formally Announces France's Conditions for Truce in Vietnam; Whether Viet Minh Agrees Is Still a Question; French Insist Viet Minh Must Accept or Reject in Full</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Saigon, 10th] France announced today to Vietnam that it would allow it full political independence and establish it as part of the French Union. This condition was announced by French High Commissioner to Vietnam Bollaert in a speech in Haiphong. Its purpose is to end the bloody war that has been going on between France and the Viet Minh Republic since last December.

Bollaert emphasized that the conditions proposed by France should be accepted in full or rejected in full. At the same time, if these conditions are accepted, both sides should issue a ceasefire order first. Bollaert called on all Vietnamese political groups to rise up and resolve the disputes in Vietnam and jointly participate in the reconstruction of Vietnam, which has been ravaged by war. He stressed that he represents the French government in making this formal appeal, "Under the French Union structure, Vietnam will gain freedom, which will become the basis for the future relationship between the French and Vietnamese peoples. There are no other restrictions except for the fact that these territories belong to the French Union."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] A dispatch from Saigon received here today stated that French High Commissioner to Vietnam Bollaert gave a broadcast speech today, agreeing to return political power in Vietnam to the Viet Minh Republic, provided that Vietnam should still be within the French Union, and that France be allowed to retain military facilities and control Vietnam's foreign policy. The last point was opposed by Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh during the Paris conference last year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 9th] The war in Vietnam is nearing its end. According to semi-official reports, the French government has decided to establish an agreement with the Ho Chi Minh government to clarify the situation in Vietnam.

Most of the Vietnamese representatives arrived in Hong Kong from Saigon on the 9th, denouncing the Ho Chi Minh government for adopting totalitarian, anti-democratic, and anti-national actions that promote division and destroy Vietnam's material and culture. The representatives stressed in their petition that the Vietnamese people deeply believe that Bao Dai can fulfill the people's demands and hopes for unity and independence. The representatives include the provisional president of Cochinchina.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] Dutch Governor-General Van Mook said today: I believe that the United Nations cannot provide an effective solution to the Indonesian problem, and only the Dutch "police action" is a way to eliminate unstable armed forces on the island, but the Netherlands should still wait for the six consuls in Batavia to submit their report to the United Nations before taking further action.</p>
<p>In view of the past handling of other disputes by the Security Council, I am not very optimistic about its ability to resolve the Indonesian problem. The UN intervention in Indonesian affairs is sufficient to delay its resolution, but it is also useful if it can ascertain the true facts. Although there is no sign of reorganization of the Indonesian government, in order to eliminate those who want to destabilize the situation there, it is necessary to reorganize the republic before it completes its independence. There are currently 93,000 Dutch troops in Indonesia, 70,000 of whom are Dutch, and the rest are islanders. After my visit to the United States, after all the efforts made by Secretary of State Marshall and Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kleffens, the United States now understands the Dutch position. Secondly, the communist forces in the Indonesian conflict cannot be ignored. As far as I know, the report to be submitted by the United Nations consular officials can only be resolved if both parties can abide by the ceasefire order, but the Indonesian side has not yet complied with the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 10th] Aneta News Agency reported that Dutch Commander General Spoor has allowed the Overseas Chinese Security Team to serve as automatic auxiliary guards to protect houses, factories, and warehouses, but they are only allowed to carry weapons while on duty.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Belgian Consuls-General Inspect War Zone</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 10th] Chinese Consul-General Chiang Chia-tung and Belgian Consul-General Steichen set off today for western Java and will report to the United Nations consular investigation team this weekend on the implementation of the ceasefire order in Bandung, Sukabumi, and Tasikmalaya.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sydney, 9th] Four Australian military officers have set off for Java to inspect the Dutch-Indonesian war as military observers. The U.S. government has also sent eight military police officers at the same time.</p>
<h3>Burmese Independence Bill to be Discussed in British House of Commons Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] When the British House of Commons reconvenes at the end of October, King George VI will attend and deliver a speech, during which he will announce the legislative plan for the Burmese regime. Authoritative political figures expect that the transfer of the Burmese regime case will be the first case discussed in the House of Commons' autumn program. The case is very brief and similar to the bill to transfer power in India.</p>
<h3>Secret Talks Held in Southern England</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 9th] It was revealed here today that British High Commissioner to Austria, Lieutenant General Steele, held secret talks with Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito in the Yugoslav summer capital of Bled, and an agreement has been reached on several important issues.</p>
<p>British sources here said that the talks were held because Marshal Tito, in view of the subtle way in which Lieutenant General Steele handled the South-Austrian border incident, wanted to meet with him before Steele left Austria to take up his new position to discuss several important issues between Britain and South.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Diplomatic figures here believe that Tito's decision to directly meet with British High Commissioner to Austria Steele is clear evidence of the easing of tense relations between Britain and Egypt. In recent months, the main issue of friction between Britain and South has been the repeated incidents in the border area between South and Carinthia province in the British-occupied zone of Austria. Tito's initiative to meet with Steele proves Tito's sincerity in resolving the disputes between the two countries. Officials here do not believe that a major resolution has been reached at the meeting in Bled.</p>
<h3>US Food Supply to Greek Troops</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 9th] Griswold, head of the US aid mission to Greece, revealed today that the United States has taken over from Britain the responsibility of supplying food to 100,000 regular Greek troops since September 1st. This cost is estimated at US$28 million, and the accumulated food is now sufficient for three months.</p>
<h3>Marshall to Personally Attend the UN General Assembly; Japanese Peace Treaty to be Discussed Outside the Meeting</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] When Secretary of State Marshall leads the US delegation to the UN General Assembly next week, he hopes to confer with foreign ministers of other countries outside the meeting on the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty in order to gain the support of other countries for his original decision. If the Soviet Union still does not change its position, it will not allow the Soviet Union to participate.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 9th] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open next Tuesday. The United States attaches great importance to it and will be led by Secretary of State Marshall himself as the head of the delegation, leading the delegation to New York this Friday. According to a State Department spokesman, the State Department will remain in New York until the four-power foreign ministers' meeting is held in London in November. Marshall's decision to spend two months working hard at the UN General Assembly shows the importance of the upcoming conference. Since Arne Lie led the delegation to attend the UN General Assembly in 1946, this is the first time that the US Secretary of State has personally led the delegation. The US delegation will begin work this Friday to prepare for the discussions. Of the five major powers attending this conference, except for the Soviet Union's Molotov, the other four countries will be attended by their foreign ministers. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie may arrive in advance to attend the opening ceremony. French Foreign Minister Bidault is expected to arrive in a few days. Bevin and Molotov will attend after the conference begins. In addition to Secretary of State Marshall, the US delegation also includes US Ambassador to the United Nations Austin and Mrs. Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Anti-Communist Armed Guerrillas Discovered in Yugoslavia; Tito Can No Longer Conceal It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 9th] There is a major situation regarding the Balkans that the world has not yet paid attention to, namely, the existence of large-scale anti-communist armed guerrillas in Yugoslavia. According to various sources, the South Country guerrillas are composed of patriotic elements who oppose the communist party and Soviet control, and are very similar to the Greek guerrillas. Both are instigated by foreign countries to resist the ruling regime in their own countries, but their representative doctrines and countries are different. Observers believe that this is tantamount to a blow to Tito with Tito's usual methods (namely, training, equipping, and supplying Greek rebels).</p>
<p>However, Tito has tried his best to avoid international knowledge of the existence of rebels in the country because he is eager to promote his iron fist. Yesterday, Belgrade officially acknowledged the existence of rebels for the first time, which was acknowledged by a statement issued by the head of the Belgrade News Agency. It is said that there are hidden rebels in the mountains, and Greek newspapers claim that artillery fire can already be heard in Greece, so Tito can no longer conceal it. It is heard that the South Country guerrillas are supplied and trained by the British-occupied zone in Austria, and their strength has increased sharply since July of this year, and as a result, they have occupied several important locations in South Country.</p>
<h3>British Delegation Personnel</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th Special] The British delegation to the UN General Assembly was announced last night. Bevin is the chief representative, and the other representatives are Minister of State McNeil, Attorney General Shawcross, Colonial Minister Jones, and British Representative to the Security Council Cadogan.</p>
<h3>Lineup of the Soviet Delegation to the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[TASS, Moscow, 9th] The Soviet Council of Ministers appointed the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly, with the following list: Delegation leader Vyshinsky, members being Soviet Permanent Representative to the Security Council Gromyko, Ambassador Zorin, Ambassador Rodionov, and Minister Sharapkin. Deputy members are Ambassador Stein, Minister Dolgilevsky, Counselor Arzumanian, and Counselor Roshchin.</p>
<p>[TASS, Kiev, 9th] The list of the Ukrainian delegation to the UN General Assembly is as follows: Delegation leader Manuilsky, Deputy Chairman of the Ukrainian Council of Ministers and Foreign Minister, members being Voina and Tymoshenko.</p>
<p>The leader of the Belorussian delegation is Kiselev, Deputy Chairman of the Belorussian Council of Ministers and Foreign Minister, members being Skorobogatko, Shmygov, Smolyar, and Kaminsky.</p>
<h3>To Implement the Marshall Plan for Aid to Western Europe, the United States Must Lend 21.9 Billion US Dollars; Experts from 16 European Countries Have Completed the Draft</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 9th] Reliable sources said that the experts from the 16 European countries discussing the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe have decided that in order to implement the European four-year economic recovery plan, the United States must provide loans of 21.9 billion US dollars. Although this figure has been approved by the experts responsible for drafting the plan, it has not yet been approved by the Economic Cooperation Committee of the 16 countries, but it is expected that the latter's approval will not be a problem. This figure of 21.9 billion US dollars is 8 billion US dollars lower than the original estimate a few days ago. According to reliable unofficial sources, the US State Department has hinted that aid amounting to nearly 20 billion US dollars is easier for Congress to pass than aid amounting to nearly 30 billion US dollars. The reduction in the estimated figures by the European countries may be due to this reason.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 10th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza has accepted the invitation of British Foreign Secretary Bevin to attend the Marshall Plan meeting to be held in Paris on September 15, at which French Foreign Minister Bidault will also attend.</p>
<h3>International New Tariff Agreement Mostly Completed</h3>
<p>Smooth Progress in Anglo-American Tariff Negotiations</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 9th] The Geneva tariff negotiations are scheduled to conclude on Wednesday. It is expected that 70 new tariff agreements will have been completed or nearly completed by then. The remaining 38 include some of the most important ones. Mr. Lagat of the Secretariat, when reporting on the progress of the tariff negotiations, stated that if the negotiations can maintain their current pace, all negotiations could be completed by mid-August. Generally speaking, global trade barriers will be reduced as a result. The UK and Commonwealth delegation held negotiations with the US delegation this morning, having previously proposed several suggestions for reducing Imperial trade preferences. These negotiations are considered the most important of all. After receiving the new proposals, US representative Mr. Wilcox is scheduled to fly to Paris on Wednesday to meet with US Undersecretary of State Mr. Clayton to discuss the actions the US should take. It is expected that, barring a sudden change in Clayton's attitude, Anglo-American tariff negotiations should proceed smoothly from now on.</p>
<h3>Mediating the Anglo-Egyptian Dispute, China Proposes a Compromise, Security Council Debate Postponed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Representatives on the Security Council are currently striving to bring the Anglo-Egyptian issue to a conclusion before the UN General Assembly opens next Tuesday. The Chinese representative is making particularly relentless efforts in this regard and is reported to have put forward a compromise proposal. A spokesperson for our side stated that the British side has welcomed any suggestion that facilitates the resumption of Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and acknowledges the validity of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Currently, in addition to the Chinese representative, representatives from other countries are also working to find a compromise solution.</p>
<h3>Two Major International Financial Institutions Meet, Discussing Global Financial Situation, Dollar Panic to be Key Topic of Discussion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The International Bank and the International Monetary Fund are scheduled to hold a 15-day meeting here starting Thursday. Over 200 representatives and advisors from 45 countries held a preparatory meeting here today.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, representatives from the British Commonwealth and colonies will also hold talks amongst the Imperial nations of the Sterling Area to discuss the financial situation and dollar panic. While Imperial representatives are unwilling to predict the outcome of these talks, they have indicated that if some unified plan can be established to navigate the dollar crisis before a normal international trade plan can be formulated, the Sterling Area discussion could be elevated to governmental level. Observers express doubts as to whether the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund can both be used to resolve the British and European dollar panic, but they believe that the focus of this meeting will inevitably be the widespread global dollar shortage. These two international financial institutions hold billions of dollars, and if they can be circulated and utilized, Europe can maintain its survival and avoid suffocation during the transitional period before receiving aid under the Marshall Plan. However, as the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund were not originally established to address international financial difficulties, it is expected that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton will suggest amending the founding principles of these two institutions at the first meeting in order to address the current crisis.</p>
<h3>Europe Urgently Needs Funds, World Bank Unable to Assist</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] World Bank Vice President Garner stated at a press conference today: "It is a mistake for anyone to think that the World Bank can provide emergency funds for Europe to purchase food and other essential goods." Garner emphasized that the World Bank is subject to various regulations, and loans must be used for productive purposes. Regarding whether the bank will offer currency stabilization loans to rebuild the monetary system, he claimed that he was not aware of this. According to the bank's managing director, the bank can grant long-term loans to stabilize currencies. Regarding Poland's application for a $600 million loan, Garner hinted that this application may be delayed for a long time due to its decision not to participate in the European Economic Recovery Conference.</p>
<h3>France Establishes Special Committee to Cope with Dollar Crisis</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] Following in the footsteps of Britain, the French government has also taken strict measures today to conserve its dwindling dollar reserves and to cope with the impending economic storm. It has also formed a special six-member "Franc Saving" committee, chaired by Prime Minister Ramadier, with Minister of Finance Schuman, Minister of National Economy Philip, State Councilor Goin, Governor of the Bank of France Monick, and the Five-Year Reconstruction Plan</p>
<h3>US Interim Aid to Europe Plan Must be Passed by Congress, Marshall Believes it is Necessary to Implement this Plan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Marshall stated today that before the Marshall Plan can take effect and be implemented, an interim transitional aid plan is needed to cope with the unbearable cold and hunger this winter. However, this interim plan must also be passed by the US Congress. As for whether Congress will convene a special session, Marshall stated that no decisions have been made regarding the details. In any case, this transitional plan is also part of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Labor Movement Launches September Offensive, Japanese Government Considers Concessions, National Cooperative Party Denies Involvement in New Party Movement</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] While the Katayama Cabinet is resisting the recent political offensive by the Liberal Party, Katayama and others are quite firm on policy and have considerable confidence in their power. However, they seem to be having difficulty dealing with the so-called "September Labor Offensive," and are showing signs of being stretched thin. Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani, while inspecting Kyushu, met with representatives of small and medium-sized industries and stated that from November 1st, staple foods can be completely rationed, so life will be greatly improved. He is currently studying with Labor Minister Yonekuba how to resolve the problem before November 1st.</p>
<p>Government Determined to Remedy Too Low Standard Wage</p>
<p>The current average wage of 1,800 yen is quite unreasonable, and the use of deficit subsidies should be considered in the future. Furthermore, when Economic Stabilization Board Director-General Wada inspected the fisheries industry in Akita on the 9th, he hinted that the standard average wage of 1,800 yen could not sustain life, and said that the government did not need to freeze it. Looking at the opinions of Mizutani, Wada, and others, the Katayama Cabinet will make concessions to the movements demanding wage increases that are flourishing in various places in order to ease the labor offensive.</p>
<p>Coal Mine Nationalization Bill Unlikely to Pass Smoothly</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The Provisional Coal Mine National Administration Bill, drafted by the Japanese government in consultation with various parties, will be submitted when the Diet reconvenes. Based on the current situation, in addition to the Liberal Party, various small parties, and the Coal Mine Industry Association (capitalists) expressing opposition, the House of Councillors is also showing reluctance. Furthermore, the recent New Party movement also has an impact on this issue, so it is difficult to predict whether it can be passed smoothly in the Diet in the future. Nishio specifically stated on the 10th: "The coal mine national administration issue has become the key to determining the fate of the Katayama Cabinet. Deliberation in the Diet is expected to be quite difficult, but the government remains confident that it can pass. If it is aborted due to the opposition of the Coal Mine Industry Association, it will have a negative impact on the working masses, and the target of 30 million tons of coal production will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, if this bill fails, the main policies in the future will also be impossible to maintain."</p>
<p>Mining Industry Firmly Opposes, Minister of Commerce and Industry Helpless</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani also met with coal mine operators in Kyushu in Fukuoka regarding the coal mine national administration issue, but because of the fierce opposition from the coal mine industry, the Minister of Commerce and Industry could not persuade them, and they eventually parted on unhappy terms.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Minister of State Miki of the Katayama Cabinet, who is from the Japanese National Cooperative Party, stated in Matsue City on the 9th that the rumors that executives of the National Cooperative Party are involved in the New Party movement of Liberal Party President Yoshida are completely untrue.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Announces Opening of Sino-Japanese Commercial Telegrams</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Allied Headquarters announced on the 10th that it would reopen commercial wireless communication between China, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea. Telegrams from China and Okinawa must be relayed through Manila, while telegrams from Korea will be relayed through San Francisco or Manila.</p>
<h3>Britain Asks US to Bear Majority of Occupation Costs in British-American Zone of Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Senate Appropriations Committee was summoned back to Washington on the 9th to hold an emergency meeting on the 20th of this month to discuss Britain's request that the United States bear the majority of the occupation costs in Germany. Britain believes it is having great difficulty paying these costs. Following the summoning of the Appropriations Committee, the Department of the Army announced that a meeting between Britain and the United States to discuss the occupation costs issue will be held here in early October. The British government is requesting a comprehensive review of the current occupation costs allocation method. According to the current expenses of the merged British-American occupation zone, the costs are borne equally by the two countries. The Department of the Army revealed that Britain believes that the reconsideration was stipulated in the agreement of last December and that the time has come.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] It was learned here on the 10th that the United States will demand unconditional control of the economy of West Germany to offset its burden of bearing most of the occupation costs. Senior government officials stated that Britain's annual costs in Germany exceed 270 million gold dollars. If the United States bears the majority of it, it should insist on taking greater responsibility for West German affairs, even to the point of having the United States economically control it. This new occupation strategy will give the United States full power and responsibility for dominating the German recovery effort.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] It was learned today that the United States has responded to an urgent request from London and is prepared to bear a large portion of the expenses of the British military occupation of Germany, possibly between 75 million and 100 million US dollars. Commissioner Monnet is a member of the committee, because the black market exchange rate of the US dollar has jumped to 287 francs, while the official exchange rate is 120 francs, so these emergency measures are being taken.</p>
<h3>Knowing He Cannot Escape Punishment, Tojo Converts to Buddhism</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Hideki Tojo knows that he cannot escape punishment for launching the Pacific War, so he ordered his close family members to prepare his posthumous Buddhist name as soon as possible. In April of this spring, he instructed his wife to ask his nephew Tokunaga Tetsuten, the chief priest of Mantoku-ji Temple in Ogura City, who had become a monk, to name him. After a long period of deliberation, Tokunaga named him "Eisho-in Shakushi Komyo Rango Koji" and chanted sutras for Tojo day and night, praying for his rebirth. Tokunaga also stated regarding this naming: "Initially, I planned to give him a Buddhist name suitable for a military person, but as a result, I wanted to use the power of Buddha to save his sins in his lifetime, so I adopted the Buddhist phrase 'bright and transcendent.'"</p>
<h3>Pu Yi Took the Stage Voluntarily</h3>
<p>Providing Important Testimony</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Woodbridge, who has been a journalist in China for many years, stated in his testimony submitted to the International Military Tribunal here this morning that the puppet emperor Pu Yi was not kidnapped from Tianjin to Northeast China by the Japanese. Woodbridge's testimony is based on his conversations with Pu Yi during his visit to Changchun in September 1932. According to Woodbridge, Pu Yi was very happy with the position of "Emperor of Manchukuo." He also told Woodbridge that the two motivations for him to take the position of "Emperor of Manchukuo" were: (1) Since the Qing Dynasty attempted to hand over sovereignty to the people, civil wars and disturbances have occurred in China; (2) The Kuomintang was extremely "disrespectful" to him, revoked his salary, and confiscated his private property. Woodbridge also said that Pu Yi at that time said that he had decided to improve all aspects of his ancestors' place of origin.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters to Dissolve Japanese Farmers Association</h3>
<p>[American News Bureau, Tokyo, 9th] Walker, a special correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, discusses the land reform plan in Japan in his recent communication. He stated that Japanese farmers are currently undergoing a dual revolution, which has now spread to the farthest corners of towns and villages. The first revolution is the land allocation plan of the Allied Headquarters, which aims to break the feudal tenancy system. Another innovation of the Allied Headquarters has not yet been launched, but it is ripe. The purpose of this plan is to dissolve the agricultural associations, which have represented the central government in controlling all matters of Japanese farmers for 48 years.</p>
<h3>Turkish Cabinet Resigns, Saja Ordered to Form New Cabinet</h3>
<p>[United Press, Ankara, 9th] Turkish Prime Minister Beq resigned today due to illness, as his policies gradually came under criticism from public opinion inside and outside the party. President Inonu appointed Foreign Minister Saja to form a new cabinet. Mr. Saja has been in office for three years, and he has contributed greatly to the plan when the United States provided Turkey with a military aid loan of 100 million US dollars. He once served as Minister of Finance and is generally recognized as an expert in handling financial affairs. The new cabinet will be temporary in nature.</p>
<h3>US Population Statistics</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Census Bureau announced today that the US population in April of this year has exceeded 143 million.</p>
<h3>Britain to Implement Disarmament</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: Senior government officials stated that Britain will implement a reduction in troops to below the number previously proposed by Prime Minister Attlee. The extent of the reduction has not yet been determined, but it is by no means a change in strategy. Attlee had suggested reducing the British army to 1,007,000 by the end of March 1948 in order to reduce government spending and free up manpower for civilian work.</p>
<h3>Last</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Marshall stated at a press conference that the Soviet Union has indeed rejected the US suggestion to hold a Four-Power conference to discuss the Korean issue. Marshall said that the US is discussing the holding of an Eleven-Nation Conference with the other ten related countries. In the near future, the US will issue invitations to all countries related to the Japanese peace conference.</p>
<h3>Nehru Determined to Exert Utmost Strength to Stop Indian Ethnic Strife, Gandhi Calls for Laying Down Arms and Restoring Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] Nehru broadcast tonight, firmly stating that he will use all his strength to stop the riots. He strongly stated that revenge is not a good thing, and the current phenomenon is even worse than revenge. In the eyes of the world, this is simply an act of slaughter. From a military point of view, these acts of slaughter must be stopped. "Will we build a new India, or will we destroy it? We must stop this evil phenomenon. We must save the people of West Bengal and stop the acts of murder, arson, and robbery."</p>
<p>Persuading With Earnestness</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 10th] Gandhi announced today that due to the ethnic strife in Delhi, he has postponed his trip to Bengal and will reside in Delhi for a long time, "until it returns to its original state." Gandhi said, "I must apply the old formula of 'action or death' to the capital of India. As far as I am concerned, I must do my part to calm this mad atmosphere." He called on those "engaged in meaningless murder, arson, and robbery" to lay down their arms and said that not giving the new government a "chance to restore order" is tantamount to "criminal suicide."</p>
<p>Delhi Under Martial Law</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 10th] Just as all soldiers in the chaotic areas of New Delhi received "shoot-on-sight" orders, Gandhi, the elderly and respected master of peace, met with Governor-General Mountbatten on the 10th to discuss the ethnic killings and to discuss countermeasures to prevent atrocities. While Gandhi and Mountbatten were meeting, Major General Sin Chuan-li, commander of the Delhi region, ordered all officers and soldiers to restore order at any cost. The chaos in the city on the 9th was clearly reduced compared to the massacre on the 8th, but a mosque was still set on fire, and the martial law order was immediately restored as a result. The Delhi administrator ordered a ban on wearing swords, carrying weapons, and sticks. The Cabinet Emergency Committee issued a public announcement, ordering searches for weapons on train passengers.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Jews and British Soldiers, 1,500 Jewish Refugees Refuse to Disembark in Hamburg</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hamburg, 9th] The third batch of 1,500 Jewish refugees on the British ship "Runnymede Park" engaged in a fierce battle with unarmed British soldiers for an hour and a half when disembarking here today. When the British soldiers entered the cabin, they did not use clubs, but after the battle became widespread, the British soldiers began to use clubs. Firefighters' high-pressure water hoses were used to spray the Jews inside the cabin. Women and children also fought hard, even more bravely than men. Jewish leaders held meetings on the ship all night yesterday, and held religious ceremonies this morning. The Jews sang the Jewish national anthem during the battle. Before ordering the disembarkation, the British military officer gave the Jews two hours to disembark voluntarily. The Jews ignored him, so he transferred troops into the cabin to force them to leave the ship.</p>

<h3>Judges Vote to Find Guilty, Sentence Ma Lai to Life Imprisonment, Civil Portion Broken Through, Family Members in Negotiations, Demand Compensation of 600 Million, Recover Gold Bars</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After five hours of secret deliberations yesterday, the US military court sentenced Ma Lai to life imprisonment and hard labor for life, ending the nine-day trial. This sentence will be submitted to General Rooks, the head of the US military advisory group, for review. Mr. Rooks has the right to agree to the sentence, and also has the right to reduce the sentence, but cannot increase it. The place where Ma Lai performs hard labor can also be decided by Mr. Rooks. After the court opened at 9:00 yesterday morning, the prosecutor listed the legal provisions in twenty minutes, explaining Ma Lai's crimes. The defendant's defense lawyer rose to argue that the Yu Shengxiao espionage case was not a conspiracy, and the conviction can only be limited to one person. The contradictions in Que Li's testimony are the best proof that Ma Lai is innocent, and so on. After the debate reached this point, the presiding officer announced the end of the debate, and all the judges retired to the lounge to hold a secret vote on whether Ma Lai was guilty. From 9:30 a.m. to 12:05 p.m., Colonel Palmer announced that it would reopen at 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Judges Repeatedly Hold Secret Deliberations</p>
<p>After reopening on time in the afternoon, they held another twenty minutes of secret deliberation. After the judges resumed their seats, they asked the prosecutor to announce the defendant's resume and his past criminal history. After reading it, the judges held a secret deliberation lasting one hour. At 2:20, the court reopened, and the presiding officer, Colonel Palmer, announced the verdict. Ma Lai and the defendant's defense lawyer stood silently to listen. The verdict stated that Ma Lai was charged with murder, and was found guilty by a majority of more than two-thirds of all the judges, and by a majority of three-quarters, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and hard labor for life.</p>
<h3>Defendant Forcibly Maintains Composure Upon Hearing Verdict</h3>
<p>When Ma Lai heard the verdict, his face was flushed, his lower lip was stretched out, and he tried to appear brave and composed, but it was not difficult to see the pain in his heart from the dull expression on his face. Feng Lai committed armed robbery at the age of eighteen and was imprisoned until he was released in 1945. If he is sentenced to life imprisonment again, he will probably spend the rest of his life in prison. After the court's verdict, He Haiyan, the lawyer for the victim's family, told reporters that the civil portion of the case is that the victim's family demanded that Ma Yielai and Que Li jointly compensate the deceased's family for living expenses and children's education fees of 600 million yuan, and demanded the return of five gold bars.</p>
<p>Ma Lai's Portion of Compensation Under Negotiation with the US Military</p>
<p>Among them, the portion concerning Ma Lai is under negotiation with the US military compensation committee. However, the maximum amount that the committee has the right to decide is only 5,000 US dollars. If it exceeds this amount, it needs to be transferred to Washington for processing, and the time may be delayed for more than two years. It is hoped that the compensation committee can find a way to raise the payment limit or handle it in other ways. Because the deceased left behind a widow and three orphans who have no means of livelihood, based on human sympathy, this should be the case both emotionally and rationally. As for Que Li's situation of assets in Shanghai, it remains to be investigated, but as an accomplice to murder, he should be responsible for making as much compensation as possible.</p>
<h3>Over Ten Thousand Tons of Surplus Materials Arrive in Shanghai on the Haitian Ship</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Haitian freighter, which went to Minas Island in July to carry the US surplus materials from the Materials Supply Bureau, completed loading and returned to Shanghai on the 1st of this month. A total of 10,200 tons were loaded, and it is scheduled to arrive at the Pier today and dock at the Qujiang Pier for unloading.</p>
<h3>Temporary Workers of the Huangpu Bureau Stop Work and Petition for Increased Benefits</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Over 500 temporary workers of the Shanghai Huangpu Bureau stopped work yesterday to demand increased benefits. In the afternoon, more than 300 people gathered to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. It is reported that in addition to the 500 temporary workers, there are also over 40 permanent workers in the bureau. The salaries of permanent workers are calculated according to the cost of living index. Before April, the salary for each temporary worker was 30,000 yuan. Recently, the workers requested an increase, which was adjusted to 35,000 yuan, but it still cannot sustain life. The temporary workers, seeing that the salary difference between them and the permanent workers is too great, demanded that it also be calculated according to the cost of living index, but it was rejected by the bureau. Therefore, they petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance. Because the Huangpu Bureau belongs to a state-owned institution, the Social Affairs Bureau was inconvenient to mediate the dispute. At that time, the petition was transferred to the Huangpu Bureau and asked to handle it themselves as soon as possible. The 300 petitioning workers did not get results, and because most of them came to Shanghai from Gaoqiao and Wusong, they could not make it back. After negotiating with Shen Ding, director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, they agreed to stay overnight in front of the Social Affairs Bureau Square last night. They are also scheduled to continue petitioning the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and the General Labor Union today.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Finalizes Budget Preparation Standards for Next Year, Living Allowance Reserve Changed to 120 Billion</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Government convened a meeting in the conference room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the general budget for next year. The meeting was attended by the heads of various bureaus and departments, chaired by Mayor Wu. The chairman stated that the budget for next year must be based on income and expenditure, and must not exceed the Municipal Government's possible income of over 983 billion next year. Because the central government cannot subsidize it, and the Municipal Government's income is limited, each bureau must re-reduce the budget, and after it is collected by the accounting office in the shortest possible time, it will be submitted to the council for approval.</p>
<p>The reporter visited Min Xiangfan, the director of the accounting office, after the meeting. He said that the standards for preparing the budget decided during the meeting were as follows: regular expenses are based on the current personnel and current work expenses. Temporary expenses (newly emerging business expenses) are based on two times the total budget for the 36th year. According to this ratio, the budget for next year will be led by the Public Works Bureau, followed by the Public Utility, Police, and Education Bureaus. Furthermore, according to the original regulations of the Municipal Government, 180 billion yuan was reserved in the total income of over 900 billion next year as a reserve for adjusting living allowances. At yesterday's meeting, it was generally believed that this reserve amount was too large, and it was decided to reduce it to 120 billion. Therefore, the remaining 60 billion yuan will be redistributed to the bureaus, and the proportions are as follows: Public Utility Bureau 33 billion, Public Works Bureau 18 billion, Police Bureau 8.4 billion, Social Affairs Bureau 3.6 billion, Health Bureau 4 billion, Land Administration Bureau 3 billion.</p>
<h3>Director of Public Works Bureau Shakes Head and Sighs</h3>
<p>When the reporter visited, Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau was hotly debating the budget issue with Director Min. Director Zhao said that the budget was too small and all projects could not be carried out. Director Min said that the Municipal Government has made the greatest efforts and there is really nothing else that can be done. Director Zhao also shook his head and sighed to the reporter, saying that the cost of engineering materials has increased tenfold, but the budget is only allowed to increase threefold. How will next year's work be carried out?</p>
<h3>The Residents of Zhu Zhai Oppose Being Under the Jurisdiction of Jiading County</h3>
<p>Representatives from Various Bureaus to Inspect the Area</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the provincial and municipal boundary demarcation, after the Executive Yuan instructed that the Panlong Port and Xiao Lai Port in the western suburbs of Shanghai be the natural boundary, the news that Zhu Zhai Township was to be placed under the jurisdiction of Jiading County was received. The various sectors of Zhu Zhai Township expressed that if this division is followed, although the southeastern half of the township would still belong to the urban area, the northwestern half would be under county jurisdiction, thus the township would again fall into a situation of being split into two, which they find difficult to accept. Therefore, on the 9th, they convened a township-wide residents' assembly, resolving to, in addition to appealing to the relevant authorities for consideration and calling on the Municipal Council for righteous assistance, also appoint representatives to appeal to the Central Government, hoping that they will respect the public's opinion and keep the northwestern Zhu Zhai Township north of the Panlong Port within the urban area, so as to maintain its integrity. Otherwise, they vow to not cooperate with the county government, which lacks any facilities, to show their firm determination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to reports: After the boundary demarcation issue was decided, the municipal and provincial public works, police, and other bureaus, as well as the Department of Civil Affairs, have each dispatched representatives, who were scheduled to depart together this afternoon to conduct on-site inspections in the respective areas and discuss handover and subsidy issues with the local county government.</p>
<h3>Traitors are Changeable, but Justice is Inevitable. Wu Chuiying Reported, Arrested, and Detained. Li Shi Qun's Adopted Son, Former Chief of the Wuxi Puppet Police Bureau, Becomes Transportation Section Chief at the Fishery Market After the Victory.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] Wu Chuiying (originally named Yi Geng, also known as Yi Geng, pictured), a captured traitor who held important positions in the puppet regime, committed numerous evils, and transformed himself into the transportation section chief of the Shanghai Fishery Market and the director of the volunteer police force after the victory, was recently reported. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters dispatched personnel on the morning of the 10th to arrest the criminal at his office in the Yangshupu Fishery Market. He is currently being temporarily held at the Garrison Headquarters Detention Center and will soon be transferred to the High Procuratorate for legal action. The criminal is a native of Jiangwan in this city and served as the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Shanghai City Defense Corps before the war, under the name Wu Yi Geng. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he changed his name to Chuiying and defected to the enemy, serving as the chief of the Wuxi County Police Bureau and the major general deputy director of the 76th Special Operations Headquarters' training class (the notorious Li Shi Qun of the 76th Headquarters also served as the class director, and Wu once recognized Li as his adoptive father). The personnel he trained served as guides for the Japanese army in the so-called "Clean-up Areas." The people in the Wuxi area hated Wu to the bone. In 1941, the current Director of the Supervisory Office of the Garrison Headquarters, Lu Peng (alias Dada), was ordered to infiltrate behind enemy lines to engage in counter-espionage work and was once arrested by Wu on October 30 of that year. After accepting the puppet regime's orders and serving as a puppet official, Wu committed numerous evils and arrested underground government workers. Unexpectedly, after the victory, Wu used the large amount of gold and silver he had plundered to lobby and operate, actually managing to escape justice. Wu also served as the transportation section chief at the Fishery Market under the name Yi Geng and as the director of the volunteer police force. In order to uphold justice, Lu Peng recently, in his capacity as a victim, submitted a report to Commander Xuan Tie Wu, accusing Wu of his crimes. After Xuan approved it, to prevent the criminal from escaping, the deputy head of the investigation team, Xiang Qiang Wei, led officers to arrest the criminal on the morning of the 10th. The criminal was wearing a Hong Kong shirt at the time and did not resist, only saying that he wanted to return home to get clothes. After being refused, he was taken to the Garrison Headquarters Detention Center in a jeep car for temporary detention. It is reported that although he tried to remain calm inside the detention center, he could not hide his panicked expression. He carried with him some so-called supporting documents, as if he knew that his "crime would be exposed."</p>

<h3>Bai Lu's Fatal Fall, Manager of the International Hotel Summoned</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Regarding the case of female movie star Du Xiaomu (Bai Lu) fatally falling in the International Hotel elevator, Mr. Yves Jiang Chao filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing the manager of the International Hotel, Foge, and others of negligence, resulting in death. This morning, Prosecutor Fang Zheng summoned the manager of the hotel, Foge, and the deputy manager and engineer, Wu Shuang Yin, to the court for questioning. According to Foge, the elevator used by the hotel was produced by the American Otis Elevator Company, and it is entirely electrically operated. The elevator door has two layers, inside and outside, which are automatically opened and closed. The inner door closes quickly, and the outer door closes slightly slower to prevent passengers from being crushed. When the elevator inner door closes, the elevator starts to rise. At this time, there is still a four-inch gap in the outer door, and Du suddenly rushed to this place, trying to pull open the outer door and step in. Unexpectedly, the elevator had already risen at this time, causing Du to fall to her death. The court hearing was adjourned for another hearing. Both defendants were ordered to return home.</p>

They had been married for several years, and their relationship was harmonious.

<h3>Dance Industry Representatives Petition Separately, Requesting the Revocation of the Ban on Dancing or Implementation of a Similar Plan to the Ban on Opium, to Give Employees a Chance to Change Careers Gracefully</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] In order to request a postponement of the ban on dancing in this city, in addition to sending representatives to Nanjing to petition various central government agencies, this morning they also went to the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and local associations in two groups to petition. In the afternoon, they continued to petition the Federation of Trade Unions and the Women's Association. One group that went to the Social Affairs Bureau arrived at around 10:00 AM, and the petition representatives included investor Chuan Fang Gui, Ni Ming De, Zhuang Hong Cheng, Gu [Blank], musician Chen Run Sheng, employee Wu Shou Gen, dancers Shen Li Fang, Jin Mei Hong, Hong Xiao Ping, and workers Wang Bu Dou, Lao Zhi, Chuan Huan Ting, and Liu Xue Geng, totaling more than ten people. The written appeal requested three points: (1) Revoke the order banning dancing. (2) If it cannot be revoked, the government should immediately resolve the issue of career change. (3) If neither of the above two points can be achieved, the government should implement a plan similar to the five-year opium ban, to give employees a chance to change careers gracefully, to avoid the suffering of unemployment and starvation.</p>
<p>Relying on Dance for a Livelihood</p>
<p>The petition representatives originally intended to meet Director Wu to express their plight in person, but because Director Wu had gone to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, they were received by Section Chief Yuan Wenzhang of the Fourth Section. The dancer representatives again stated that it is not easy for dancers to change careers to become female workers. Most dancers have heavy family burdens, relying on their livelihood to support several family members, and dancers rely on their dance skills to make a living. Once unemployed, the consequences would be unimaginable. At this point, they covered their faces and were about to cry. Section Chief Yuan expressed that he sympathized with the plight of the dance industry, but said that the principle of banning dancing was determined by the central government, and the local government could only be responsible for its implementation. Director Wu is very clear about the situation of the dance industry, and in the opinion on banning dancing submitted to the central government, he stated the plight of the dance industry in this city in great detail. All the appeals and written appeals of the dance industry were also submitted to the central government for reference.</p>
<p>Many Letters of Complaint Received</p>
<p>Section Chief Yuan believes that the extravagant lifestyle of general red dancers also needs to be reviewed by the dance industry itself. If Chuan Xia Danwei's dance ticket income reaches tens of millions of yuan in one night, this kind of extravagant style cannot be allowed to continue, and China and England are paying close attention to this. The petition representatives said that this is a very small number of exceptional cases, and they asked the authorities to still consider the livelihoods of the majority of dancers. Section Chief Yuan promised to forward the written appeal to the central government, and the petition representatives then left.</p>
<p>It is reported that before the petition yesterday, a dancer originally intended to take her child to the Social Affairs Bureau to complain to Director Wu, but was later dissuaded. In addition, Director Wu has recently received many letters of complaint from dancers, one of which stated that her husband is unemployed, and she has two children, so a family of four relies on her dancing as a living. After losing her job, she has no way to make a living.</p>
<p>Going to Nanjing to Petition, Returning to Shanghai on the Evening Train</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Shanghai dance industry representatives, including Sun Hong Yuan, Shen Zhi Min, and Meng Yan, and a group of ten people, arrived in Nanjing by plane at around 10:00 AM on the 10th. They went to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to petition, requesting (1) the revocation of the ban on dancing; (2) responsibility for providing career changes; (3) reference to the opium ban method of a five-year ban. Director Yao of the Ministry of Interior and Secretary Yang of the Ministry of Social Affairs expressed that the ban on dancing is a government law and is difficult to change, but promised to forward their difficult situation. When the representatives went to the venue of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, they were received by Hong Lan You. Shen Zhi Min and Meng Yan tearfully stated that they were forced to dance due to the heavy pressure of life in order to maintain the livelihood of their families, and hoped that the authorities would be sympathetic to their difficulties. Hong promised to convey this situation to the entire meeting. The representatives, having completed their business in Nanjing, returned to Shanghai on the evening train that day.</p>
<h3>XMHD Stops Broadcasting Because of Failure to Register</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, Dong Xian Guang, replied to a reporter's question about "Why was Shanghai's XMHD radio station ordered to stop broadcasting" by saying: The station began broadcasting on August 15th without the approval of the Ministry of Communications and without applying for registration. This violates the regulations for the establishment of radio stations, so it was ordered not to broadcast until approved by the government. Last Saturday, the Shanghai Western newspaper also reported that the Songhu Garrison Command ordered the station to stop broadcasting foreign language programs because "English programs are not allowed to be broadcast in China." This is completely inconsistent with the facts. There are no regulations in our country prohibiting the broadcasting of foreign language programs. Article 24 of the regulations for the establishment of radio stations stipulates that "The language of broadcasting should be mainly Chinese language, unless the radio station has a special mission approved by the Ministry of Communications." The order for XMHD radio station to stop broadcasting is entirely because it has not completed registration procedures. Any radio station may not broadcast without approval.</p>
<h3>Elderly People Who Have Not Reached 60 Years of Age Are Not Allowed to Hold Extravagant Birthday Celebrations. The Municipal Government is Considering Limiting All Unnecessary Entertainment.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] A reporter visited the responsible authorities of the Municipal Government yesterday to inquire about the implementation steps of the city's savings measures.

As for the implementation steps, it will be discussed at the municipal meeting tomorrow. In addition, the municipal government is also considering saving on unnecessary entertainment, such as not allowing elderly people under 60 years of age to hold extravagant birthday celebrations, not allowing banquets to be held for non-official matters, and simplifying celebrations of joy and funerals as much as possible, in order to gradually cultivate a thrifty atmosphere.</p>
<h3>North-South Ocean and Yangtze River Freight, Additional Levy of Charity Donations in Various Places, Fees Received in Guangdong and Guangxi to be Reported and Remitted Within a Time Limit</h3>

<h3>Conscription About to Start, Implementation Must be Thorough, Volunteer Registration Shows Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>According to a statement issued by Zhang Tingsong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government: Shanghai's handling of military affairs was originally a pioneering effort, and there are many difficulties. However, conscription is one of the mobilization tasks, and its execution must be thorough to complete the major task. The conscription period is approaching, and what can be reported is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The registration of volunteers in this city began on the 25th of last month and has lasted for two weeks. Initially, because issues such as family settlement fees had not been resolved, the number of people going to various districts to register was small. After improvements were made, such as ordering each district to organize a farewell meeting for volunteers joining the army and launch a comfort campaign, and setting up a volunteer registration office in the new recruit conscription center, according to reports from conscription supervisors sent to various districts, the registration situation has become enthusiastic. It is scheduled to begin conscription on the 15th of this month, and by the end of this month, the 3,000 volunteers will be completely conscripted.</p>
<p>(2) The family settlement fee for volunteers should be 4 million yuan, which is to be raised by the Military Service Association of this city. This amount requires more than 100 billion yuan. The preferential treatment funds for draftees exempted from military service and the preferential treatment funds for households with no draftees going to war have just begun to be collected, and there is a shortage of funds. Currently, the mayor has negotiated with the municipal bank to borrow 2.5 billion yuan to advance to the Military Service Association. The Military Service Association is currently handling the procedures. This 2.5 billion yuan will be used to pay the family settlement fees for volunteers to be conscripted on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>(3) The crime regulations for obstructing military service formulated by the central government are very strict. Conscription is mobilization. If efforts are not made to conscript enough volunteers, personnel at all levels in districts and baos will be punished. The Civil Affairs Department has repeatedly ordered each district to work hard to meet the needs of mobilization and has recently sent personnel to various districts to supervise and urge the work.</p>
<p>(4) The first batch of volunteers conscripted in this city has been negotiated with the regiment management area and is scheduled to be allocated to a department on the 15th of this month. At that time, the Military Service Association will hold a warm send-off meeting for them to join the army. It is heard that citizens in various districts will also spontaneously launch send-off events.</p>

<h3>Expanding Fundraising for Student Aid, Forming "Special Fundraising Team," Hoping Enthusiastic Readers Will Do Their Best to Support</h3>
<p>In order to expand the effectiveness of fundraising for the "Reader Student Aid Fund," we have launched a "Special Fundraising Team" to solicit donations from all levels of society. The units participating in the special fundraising team include banks, advertising agencies, and general companies and businesses. With the enthusiastic assistance of many commercial groups, we hope that the fundraising work can be widely carried out. However, this kind of "Special Fundraising Team" will not achieve satisfactory results without the support of enthusiastic readers. Here, we sincerely appeal to our readers to give the "Special Fundraising Team" the greatest support and promotion, in order to achieve the expected goal of ten billion yuan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zhuang and Mr. Wang Juerong each generously donated one million yuan, and Mr. Wang is our familiar sponsor. I recall that during the Anti-Japanese War, when we held the first "Reader Student Aid Fund," Mr. Wang donated a large sum of money to kick off the event. This time, he transferred one million yuan of manuscript fees for student aid. We express our highest respect for Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for student aid (donation report published in the Social Service Column).</p>

<h3>Field Inspection of Zibo Mining Area: Light Metal Factory, Leading in East Asia</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Zhangdian, 5th] On the way back to Zhangdian from the Zibo area, passing through Nanding (Zichuanma), I had the opportunity to visit the light metal factory that was praised by the Japanese invaders as being the leading one in East Asia.</p>
<p>This factory officially started construction in February of the 32nd year [1943], when the Japanese invaders named it the "North China Clay Soil Company Zhangdian Light Metal Factory." It is estimated that the reserve of aluminum alone is 20 million tons in Wangcun, 50 million tons in Hutian, and countless tons elsewhere, and the alumina content is as high as 45% to 75%. No wonder the Japanese invaders praised it incessantly, saying, "Shandong's aluminum mine is inexhaustible."</p>
<p>Because Japan itself produced too little aluminum to meet the massive consumption during the war, after formally building a factory in Nanding in October of the 32nd year, the initial plan was to complete it in seven years, then changed to five years, then to three years, and finally, with full spirit, the strike method was changed to one and a half years. By May of the 34th year, the first of the five boilers in the plan was finally completed and formally started to produce aluminum.</p>
<p>While officially building, the Japanese invaders recruited 800 elementary school and junior high school graduates from Tianjin and Zhangdian and sent them to Japan for eight months of training. By the spring of the 34th year, they returned to China to serve as the factory's basic, that is, low-level technical and management personnel. As for middle-level staff, they were filled by Taiwanese, and high-level staff by Japanese. Until the eve of the Japanese invaders' surrender in August of the 34th year, the employees who continued to be responsible for building the remaining four boiler projects in the factory reached 35,000. At that time, from Zhangdian through Nanding, Zichuan, to Boshan, the air was full of high-voltage power lines and telephone heavy car electric light lines, and the underground was railways, highways, tramways, light railways, crisscrossing like a dragnet, creating a spectacle. According to Mr. Geng Zhanyuan, a current Shandong Provincial Senator who was engaged in underground work at that time, the factory's east and west plants, together with the residential guards and other districts, covered an area of five square kilometers. Inside, 24 warehouses stored a total of 2,500 pieces of electrical equipment ranging from 5 horsepower to 200 horsepower, 5,000 tons of miscellaneous grains, 10,000 tons of flour, and 50,000 bolts of cloth. All the machines needed to build the factory had almost been shipped in, but until August 21st of the 34th year, when the Japanese army surrendered, the communist bandits invaded on the 23rd of the same month. The 1,500 Japanese troops stationed there retreated without a fight, and the communist bandits took the opportunity to loot all the stored grain, flour, cloth, and machinery that could be moved. The communist bandits occupied the area for 18 days. On September 14th, the Japanese army, under government orders, recovered the factory. The Ministry of Economic Affairs then sent Han Bingduo, who was then an engineer at the Xihe Yuesheng Coal Mine, as a representative to handle the "looting" with the factory director, Oda. Han asked Oda to recreate the original inventory list, overreporting the value. Oda once said with tears in his eyes, "I can't change it without letting down my friends, but I can't change it without letting down my country."</p>
<p>After Han "looted" the factory, the local National Army team was responsible for guarding it. The local team had no fixed funding during the war and mostly requisitioned grain on the spot. Since the factory had no grain to requisition, it dismantled and sold things from the factory to make a living. According to Geng, only in terms of alkali material, the original storage was 1,000 tons, but by the time the ceasefire order was issued on January 13th of the 35th year, only 200 to 300 tons remained!</p>
<p>On January 13th of the 35th year, the bandits disregarded the ceasefire agreement and made a second invasion, capturing and killing Han Bingduo. Before the second withdrawal on July 11th of the 35th year, they again transported important movable machinery, steel materials, and all furniture to the Yimeng Mountains via the Zhangbo branch line and then by car from Badou.</p>
<p>On July 11th of the 35th year, the National Army recovered Zibo for the second time. The National Army's 73rd Army then sent a battalion of troops to garrison Nanding, and the National Resources Commission established the Shandong Aluminum Company, with a Mr. Ruan in charge of the takeover.</p>
<p>It once started operation employing a hundred workers to begin reorganization inside but less than a month later, operation stopped again. The reason being that the National Resources Commission didn't come up with the money to cover the employees' living expenses. After operations ceased, a Mr. Zhang was assigned to guard it. As a result, some machines, motors, scattered equipment, and other materials left through the "back door." On February 23rd of this year, the communist bandits invaded for the third time, and the custodians retreated to Jinan. By August 17th, the National Army had recovered it for the third time. It has been more than half a month since then, and the National Resources Commission has not sent anyone to take over. The local National Army has not dispatched regular troops to garrison the area, nor has the National Resources Commission requested additional troops. When the reporter visited, all I saw were dilapidated houses, ruined buildings, and broken machine parts everywhere, and wild grass grew luxuriantly, reaching knee-high, making it appear even more desolate. Before the reporter and others went to visit, they had already asked the garrison in Zhangdian to</p>
<p>deploy a company of soldiers to the nearby area to defend them. There was also a platoon of soldiers accompanying the reporter as guards. Initially, we did not expect that while the reporter and others were in the middle of the visit, dense gunfire suddenly came from the southern part of the factory area, and we knew that there must be communist bandits lurking inside. Helplessly, we had to withdraw hastily midway and drive to Zhangdian under strict guard.</p>
<p>Oda, the factory director in the past, once told people that the total construction and equipment costs of the factory amounted to 30 billion Japanese yen, and this factory alkali had been listed by the Japanese side as part of the war debt compensation. However, according to Geng, only one-fifth of the machinery that remains today is left. A gentleman traveling with us once said to the reporter with great emotion: "Lattimore once said: 'The fruits of victory that China has won in the War of Resistance will tend to be destroyed in the subsequent wars.' Today, I visited the first light metal factory in East Asia, and it has implicitly confirmed Lattimore's prediction. It is not others who are destroying China's victory, but the Chinese Communist Party." (Special Correspondent Li Tian)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong-China Trade Suffocates, a New Trick Appears: the "All-Access Import Permit"</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hong Kong, 5th] The Hong Kong trade market, shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere, has not benefited at all since the government announced the amendment to the "Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Management Measures" and the amendment to the "Import and Export Shanghai Trade Measures" on August 17th. On the contrary, due to changes in the settlement methods, the focus of exports has also been shifted from Hong Kong to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Just as Hong Kong merchants were at a loss, a new trick of an "all-access import permit" suddenly appeared at the Kowloon Customs by accident. The method is as follows: The customs specially allows livestock, poultry, fresh fish, vegetables, eggs, and other goods to be transported from various parts of South China to Hong Kong. At the same time, it allows the purchase of goods in categories II and III (A) (excluding automobiles and films) listed in the appendix to be imported, and when passing through the Kowloon Customs at all checkpoints with the permit, they can be verified and released without the need to obtain an import permit, which has been implemented since August 23.</p>
<p>Why did the Kowloon Customs come up with this new trick? Some say it is one of the exchange conditions of the Hong Kong-China Economic Cooperation Agreement. The Hong Kong government allows assisting China's customs in cracking down on smuggling, and the Chinese customs allows Guangzhou to import food urgently needed by Hong Kong. However, since the Hong Kong-China Economic Cooperation Agreement has been aborted, there is no doubt that it is implemented separately first. Another saying is that the Chinese customs, seeing that Hong Kong-China trade is dying and smuggling is becoming increasingly rampant, wants to try this new method to completely cut off the source.</p>
<p>Regardless of the motivation, the "all-access import permit" does give the Hong Kong market a great excitement. It immediately became a valuable security that everyone scrambled to buy, and there is a daily market price. Initially, it was 40% higher than the original amount, but now it has risen to 60%. Guangdong merchants, seeing where the profit lies, do not hesitate to massively purchase livestock, poultry, vegetables, fresh fish, and eggs to Hong Kong, especially livestock. Recently, the supply of livestock in Hong Kong has exceeded demand, and prices have plummeted. Merchants have suffered heavy losses in the price of goods, but fortunately, the "all-access import permit" is a rare commodity that can be stocked up, and the losses in the price of goods can still be recovered from another aspect.</p>
<p>The "all-access import permit" is not a legal term, and according to its nature, it is not "all-access." It has the following many restrictions: (1) Return goods are limited to Guangzhou; (2) All goods are not allowed to be re-exported after arriving in Guangzhou; (3) The number is small and difficult to buy in large quantities; (4) Imports and exports are only at the Da Jing Pass, which stipulates that ships under 200 tons can come and go, so goods transported to Guangzhou cannot be transported by large ships, and the risk is greater.</p>
<p>It is not clear how long this new trick will be tested, but it is generally predicted that this is only a temporary expedient to give Hong Kong merchants who have suffocated a breather. In the future, when Hong Kong's food imports are too much and the merchants' losses reach the point where they can no longer be compensated by the "all-access import permit," this method will automatically lose its function and be terminated. Let's watch! (Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng)</p>

<h3>Our Delegation Proposes to the YMCA to Establish Universal Principles of Basic Education; Full Text of Proposal to Be Submitted to General Assembly Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Far East Basic Education Conference held its first and second group meetings on the morning of the 10th. All representatives and experts who originally participated in each group attended. The meeting's situation and resolutions are recorded as follows: (Shen) Group 1, "General Administration Group," chaired by U Ba Lwin (Burma), resolved the following key points: (1) The definition of basic education should adhere to the fundamental concepts established in the publications of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), with particular emphasis on "a common foundation for all people," and should adapt to the needs of children and their social and material environment. (2) No rigid decisions were made regarding the duration of schooling; further research is needed, and decisions should be based on each country's national conditions, local environment, and other factors. (3) The ultimate responsibility for basic education rests with the central government, but assistance should be obtained from other agencies and local organizations to determine the nature and content of education. (4) Adult education should be based on the principle of non-compulsion, but compulsory methods may be adopted in certain special circumstances in large industrial and urban areas. (5) All schools should emphasize moral education, the meaning of which is to promote correct thought and life. Religious instruction should be determined by each country. (6) Basic education should be co-educational. (7) Education authorities should obtain the cooperation of other government agencies and social organizations. (8) Specialized agencies should be established to train adult education personnel. (9) Under the guidance of UNESCO, each country may obtain international assistance through voluntary donations within the next five years. This assistance is limited to special projects in certain regions of each country. (10) Each country may levy an education tax for basic education, the details of which shall be determined by each country. The education tax rate and the national economic capacity should be studied, especially in the Far East countries. (11) Improving the treatment of teachers is a problem that should be addressed worldwide. To attract talented young people with modern professional training to engage in education, teacher compensation should be sufficiently high to guarantee their basic living needs and be equal to other professions. (12) Basic education should be completely free. (13) The training of basic education personnel is generally the same as the opinions put forward by the preparatory meeting. Vocational training and intellectual education should be given equal importance.</p>
<p>Language Teaching Outline</p>
<p>(B) Group 2, "Technical Methods Group," chaired by Dikshya (Nepal), discussed the language teaching outline drafted by our delegation, represented by Cheng Qibao, based on the opinions of the preparatory meeting and UNESCO. Key points of the resolution: (1) Language teaching should pay attention to the different levels, different individuals, and different social needs of the educated. (2) The mother tongue should be the main teaching tool. Experts should conduct thorough research, improve it, and assist ethnic groups without written languages in creating a writing system or selecting a suitable writing system. (3) Those who have successfully learned their mother tongue should be encouraged to learn other auxiliary languages. (4) Experts should be assembled to conduct research on phonetics and phonetic symbols. UNESCO can also establish a central research institution and several working branches to conduct research. (5) Regarding basic literacy vocabulary, it is hoped that it will be gradually and greatly expanded according to the needs of the educated to read newspapers and write letters, the differences between grades and life, and the requirements of modern knowledge, and divided into central vocabulary, auxiliary vocabulary, and 30 categories of specialized vocabulary. (6) In addition to learning from reading materials, teaching methods should make extensive use of visual aids, projectors, charts, specimens, and other new-style collective teaching tools and methods. UNESCO should provide assistance in a unified plan for the supply of these needs.</p>
<p>The discussion items of the two group meetings were completed on the morning of the 10th. The reports will be submitted to the general assembly in the next few days. Once passed, they will become resolutions of the general assembly, and will be sent to the UNESCO regional research meeting and the UNESCO Second General Assembly for reference and adoption.</p>
<p>Passed Three Proposals</p>
<p>At 3 p.m., the third group, the "Content and Teaching Material Group," held a group meeting (the originally scheduled general assembly was postponed to the morning of the 11th), chaired by Basson (New Zealand), passed three proposals: (1) Wang Zongjing (Malaysia) proposed to investigate local customs that are harmful to health and hygiene, and carry out educational reforms within the scope that does not hinder freedom of religion. (2) Luo Ruisi (UNESCO) proposed that UNESCO prepare a complete set of wall charts and teaching aids for general knowledge, which will be distributed to various places for application. Ai Weidang, advisor to our delegation, proposed that in addition to widely using various indirect teaching aids, we should also pay attention to the actual education methods of using real objects, such as the promotion and education of good seeds. Direct methods are far more effective than indirect methods, which was accepted by the meeting. (3) Qu Juchen proposed to formulate basic principles for basic education, which will be applicable to any region and any country, so that basic education can truly be the foundation for all people. Every person can understand their rights and responsibilities as a citizen of the world.

<h3>Rice Industry Association Discusses Salt Affairs; Issue of Organizing a United Transportation Company; Decision to Prepare Opinions for Chairman Wu to Review</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Food Allocation Committee intends to establish a storage and transportation office in order to enrich the city's food reserves during the new grain season. It will entrust rice merchants to organize a United Transportation Company to purchase a large amount of rice from the producing areas to be stored in Shanghai for emergencies, so as to maintain normal grain prices. The funds for the United Transportation Company are tentatively set at 5 billion yuan, and the government can lend 10 billion yuan if necessary. Chairman Wu Kaixian convened rice merchants a few days ago to solicit their opinions on this matter. The Rice Industry Trade Association then convened a meeting of directors and supervisors at 3 p.m. yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Qu Zhenhua, Xu Songren, Hu Wenan, and Zha Baosan. Wan Molin served as chairman. The discussion on the issue of organizing the United Transportation Company was very heated. Some people agreed and some people opposed it. The reason for those who opposed it was whether the rice price could be stabilized with certainty after the establishment of the United Transportation Company? Furthermore, purchasing a large amount of rice from the producing areas to Shanghai can stimulate the price of rice. If the price of rice rises at that time, can it be guaranteed that the public opinion's attack on rice merchants can be eased? After careful discussion, it was decided that the association would first draft its opinions on this issue and the articles of association of the United Transportation Company and submit them to the Food Allocation Committee, and then make a decision after Chairman Wu Kaixian returned to Shanghai. During the meeting, it was unanimously believed that rice merchants were unable to bear the funds of 5 billion yuan for the United Transportation Company. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. According to Wan Molin's interview with the reporter, rice merchants have had many past experiences. For example, the implementation of grain loans has not been successful, but has caused panic among rice merchants in the city. After Zhang Jia'ao took charge of the Central Bank, he has repeatedly wanted rice merchants to assist in stabilizing rice prices and proposed that rice merchants could be allowed to mortgage rice to the government at an 80% discount. Rice merchants have not agreed. Now the authorities want to entrust the establishment of a United Transportation Company, and rice merchants still need to consider this carefully.</p>

It is hoped that all industries will strictly abide by this and assist the government in stabilizing prices.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Pays Attention to Rising Flour Prices</h3>

At this moment, the re-export of rice must be approved by this Ministry, while the export of wheat is prohibited, and the price is stable. Flour is subject to a quota-based re-export period. The rising price of flour is a phenomenon that should not occur.

<h3>Raising Loan Interest Rates: Four Banks Joint Office to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss</h3>
<p>The issue of raising loan interest rates has been a topic of much discussion recently. It has been learned that this matter has been debated for several years, and the old issue has been brought up again. It is reported that the Four Banks Joint Office will submit the issue for resolution at today's board meeting. According to relevant sources, China's industry has gradually laid its foundation, and the low-interest funding provided by state banks has not been without merit. However, 80% of the funds needed for loans come from ordinary commercial banks, with state banks accounting for only 20%. Therefore, the calculation of production costs and interest expenses is based on commercial banks. In general, raw materials account for 50% of production costs, labor costs account for 40%, expenses account for 5%, and interest, calculated at market rates, is less than 5%. Interest calculated at state bank rates is only 1%. The production process for industry is very short; therefore, raising loan interest rates has no impact on production costs and cannot stimulate general price increases. If general manufacturers hoard low-interest products and do not sell them, their interest costs will naturally increase. However, most borrowers are for daily necessities. Since they are daily necessities, they should have appropriate sales channels and there should be no hoarding. Otherwise, low-interest funds may flow into speculation.</p>
<h3>Group Dividend Savings, Second Phase Projected at 4 Billion</h3>
<p>The Group Dividend Savings program, sponsored by the Central Trust Bureau, has successfully completed its first phase of 2 billion yuan.

Although there have not been many depositors since the program started, based on the experience of the first phase, the number of depositors in the last ten days of the month will be significantly higher than in the first two ten-day periods, so the results of this phase may exceed the projected figures.</p>
<h3>Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices Increase Again; 20-Count Yarn Rises by 200,000 Yuan</h3>

In total, the two sessions sold 2,705 pieces of yarn, equivalent to 4,645 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 1,618 purchase orders received.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company's allocation of cotton yarn to cloth factories in other areas, originally scheduled for the first Wednesday of each month, has been changed to the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month, with two allocations per month.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices are Firm and Brisk</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw higher allocated prices from the Textile Adjustment Committee through the China Textile Construction Company. The price of 42-count fine yarn was raised by 700,000 yuan, and 20-count yarn was raised by 200,000 yuan, immediately boosting market sentiment. Actual market demand was strong, and speculators took the opportunity to drive up prices. As a result, 42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was pushed up to 19 million yuan, a further increase of 650,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of yarn, both coarse and fine, such as 20-count, 16-count, 42-count, and 40-count, also rose across the board by varying amounts from 300,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw improved sales in various regions, increased demand from merchants on Changjiang Road, and urgent restocking from dye factories. Local sales turned brisk, and prices rose sharply. The most traded item throughout the day was 20-count extra fine cloth, with dye factories purchasing 400 to 500 pieces at a price of 400,400 yuan, an increase of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day. "Dragon Head" fine cloth once rose to 525,000 yuan, but after limited trading, it fell back to 517,000 yuan, an increase of 9,000 yuan. Other grades of fine cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, twill, khaki, and shirting also rose by varying amounts from 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Holds Meeting of Standing Directors</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The 85th meeting of the standing directors of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association was held yesterday at 11:00 AM in the Association's meeting room, chaired by Wang Qiyu. Six important cases were discussed. Among the more important ones was the fourth case, concerning two proposed motions for the upcoming Second General Meeting of the National Yarn Factory Association. The motions were that woven products made from self-spun yarn should not be subject to business tax, and that machine printing fees should be based on the number of deposit slips at a rate of 500 yuan per piece (i.e., per slip). The motions requested the General Meeting to appeal to the Ministry of Finance for approval. It was resolved that Cheng Jingtang would be responsible for reviewing the motions before they were submitted to the meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Ease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended soft, continuing its downward trend. The Association's quoted prices for spot goods were initially 690,000 yuan for Grade 2 raw sugar and "White Chu," later falling to 687,000 yuan, a decrease of over 10,000 yuan. "Hechi" was at 690,000 yuan, "Shanti Qing" at 627,000 yuan, down 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, with dozens of bags traded. "Diao Qing" was at 580,000 yuan, then down to 570,000 yuan, with hundreds of bags traded, down over 10,000 yuan. "Xinghua White" (bagged, high-quality) was at 760,000 yuan, down 10,000 yuan, and "Xing Chi" was at 640,000 yuan, down 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with 300 to 400 pieces traded. It is observed that recent actual sales have been relatively low, hence the market price is gradually easing.</p>
<h3>Eight Types of Public Bonds Drawn for Redemption</h3>
<p>The following eight types of public bonds, were drawn yesterday in Shanghai for principal redemption: the Republic of China 25th Year Unified Public Bond (Class B), the 17th Year Long-Term Financial Public Bond, the 25th Year Readjustment of Guangdong Financial Public Bond, the 25th Year Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bond, the 26th Year Guangdong Province Port River Engineering U.S. Dollar Public Bond, the 28th Year Construction Public Bond (First Issue), the 28th Year Military Supplies Public Bond (Second Issue), and the 30th Year Military Supplies Public Bond (Third Issue). All winning bonds, except for the 26th Year Guangdong Province Port River Engineering U.S. Dollar Public Bond, where the assigned Guangdong Customs surtax for principal and interest payment was seized by the enemy, resulting in a temporary suspension of payment of principal and interest until the funds are cleared and a new repayment date is set, the principal and interest of the remaining bonds will be paid by the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with the original repayment dates stipulated in the bond regulations.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Fall Again, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Public bonds fell sharply again yesterday. Rooms 230 and 538 saw some buying of "Dacheng New," while Room 550 and others were selling. "Unified C" fell from 14,001 to 12,900 yuan at the close. As a result, "Unified A" and "B" fell by 800 yuan compared to the previous close, "Unified C" fell by 700 yuan, "Unified D" fell by 1,100 yuan, and "Unified E" also fell by 900 yuan. Trading volume was only around 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to see buying interest yesterday, and the upward trend of small stocks remained strong. Jewish investors provided support, Guangdong investors entered and exited, and securities firms and retail investors were buying. "Ewo Yarns" opened at 92,800 yuan, with a low of 92,200 yuan and a high of 93,800 yuan, hovering around 93,000 yuan at noon. As a result, "Jardine Matheson" rose by slightly less than 10%, while "Wing On," "Paper Industries," and "Steel Industries" rose by 5%, and other stocks saw slight gains.</p>
<h3>Bullish Investors Take Profits, Chinese Stocks Trend Weak</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks appeared to be ignored yesterday. Any apparent gains at the opening quickly dissipated, as short-term profit-taking bullish investors took profits, causing prices to fall again. Interest rates in the over-the-counter market opened high at 19.5 fen and 24 fen, but soon became unsustainable, with even less trading and a bleak situation. Prices stabilized somewhat near the close.</p>
<p>The market opened strong, carrying the momentum from the previous close. "Wing On Yarns" opened higher, and No. 32 was still being bought, rising to 247 yuan. Nos. 186 and others collectively took profits, creating an oversupply situation. Nos. 104 and 152 were slightly bought in the middle of the day, but the momentum could not be sustained, and prices eventually fell to 239 yuan. Nos. 157 and 152 absorbed the selling pressure, slightly recovering.</p>
<p>After 10:30 AM, over-the-counter interest rates opened at 19.5 fen and 24 fen. With Nos. 85 and others selling heavily, signs of borrowing also appeared, and prices fell to 235 yuan. Spot trading also saw a low price of 235 yuan. After 11:30 AM, No. 157 maintained stability, and Nos. 223 and others bought in, briefly rising to around 240 yuan near noon. Nos. 65 and 235 sold again, and "Wing On Yarns" spot trading closed at 238 yuan. Bidding prices were weak after the close.</p>
<p>As a result, among spot trading stocks, "Hua Feng," "New Light," and "King Fook" saw slight gains. "Wing On Yarns," "Meiya," "Wing On Public," and "Qin Xing" saw slight declines. "New China" fell by 5%, "Sino-French," "Xinghe," and "Innerwear," "China Textile" were flat. "Li An" fell by 5%. "Rong Feng," "Matches," and "Jing Lun" saw slight gains. "Tai Tung," "China Silk," and "Commercial Press" saw slight declines. Among deferred trading stocks, "Hua" and "Jing" were flat. "Wing On Yarns," "Xinghe," "Meiya," "New Light," and "Qin Xing" saw slight declines. Over-the-counter old stocks were generally stable.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Water and Electricity Stocks to be Listed on a Trial Basis Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, the Stock Exchange held its 24th Board Meeting, passing three important cases: (1) Zhabei Water and Electricity Co., Ltd. stocks will be listed on a trial basis on September 12th. (2) The deadline for deferred trading is approaching at the end of September, and it was decided to consult with the base to extend the deadline. (3) The Stock Exchange's 1 billion yuan scholarship fund will be jointly managed with the Municipal Government's Scholarship Review Committee.</p>
<h3>Financial Industry Special Business Tax: Bankers Association Requests Reduction</h3>
<p>The National Financial Industry previously stated that the special business tax promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, with a tax rate of 4% and a tax law based on income (including interest, handling fees, exchange spreads, etc.), was too burdensome. They had submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for exemption, which was subsequently rejected by the Ministry. The Ministry instructed local bankers' associations to comply. It is now learned that the National Bankers Association has resolved to reduce the burden on member banks in various regions and to comply with national policies and increase national treasury revenue. They have once again requested the Ministry of Finance to reduce the originally set tax rate and re-determine the calculation of income. The submission was telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance for review on the morning of the 10th. Once the Ministry of Finance decides on the measures, the special business tax for the financial industry nationwide can begin to be implemented.</p>
<h3>Rayon Market is Quiet</h3>
<p>Rayon's 38th allocation is due for payment and delivery today, so the market was quiet yesterday, and prices remained unchanged, fluctuating between 5.8 million and 5.9 million yuan throughout the day. The transaction price for No. 120 "Gold Three Horses" was 25.9 million yuan, and the selling price was quoted at 6 million yuan, similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Because the autumn flood season was poor, market sentiment was positive, and yesterday's trading volume increased by 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The asking price for D-grade was 32 million yuan, and for E-grade it was 1.5 million yuan, both with 7-day futures. Although there were no transactions for ABC grades, asking prices also rose accordingly. The head price for 28.5 dan of dried silk was 21.5 million yuan, also up 500,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Because factories were bullish, raw silk comforter covers opened higher, but because merchants had tight cash flow, selling outweighed buying, and prices fell back. "Dacheng Huajiang" prices were the same, opening at 2.63-2.64 million yuan, then gradually falling to close at 2.42 million yuan spot price, and 2.5 million yuan for deferred delivery, up more than 200,000 yuan from the previous day. There were still no transactions for "Meiya" goods. "Grid Crepe" asking price was up 1,000 yuan, and other autumn sales goods remained firm.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil and Bristle Purchase Work Concludes</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] According to the Central Trust Bureau, the Bureau was previously ordered to purchase tung oil and bristles, but the purchase work was concluded after the government revised the exchange settlement and import/export trade measures. To date, the total amount purchased by the Bureau is approximately 7,500 metric tons of tung oil and approximately 6,300 quintals of bristles. The total amount sold is approximately metric tons of tung oil and approximately 3,300 quintals of bristles</p>

<h3>Endless Rent Increases; Poor Civil Servants are Overwhelmed</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a low-ranking civil servant currently living in a flat (a small room) in the Xujiajiao area of Yulin Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai. When I moved in in October of the 34th year, I spent a small fee, and the monthly rent was only 1,500 yuan. From December of the 34th year, it increased to 3,500 yuan. From February of the 35th year, it increased again to 10,000 yuan. In May, it suddenly increased to 60,000 yuan. It has increased forty-fold in seven months. At that time, I was too busy with my own life, and because of time constraints, I was unable to negotiate with the landlord. Now the landlord is asking for two dou of white rice per month in rent. The price of rice has risen to more than 500,000 yuan per dan. Sir, how can someone like me, with a monthly income of several hundred thousand yuan and burdened with the heavy responsibility of supporting a family, afford a monthly rent of more than 100,000 yuan? Generally speaking, this rent price exceeds the rent price of Western-style houses in the city center. Now I have several questions, please answer: (1) Is their unlimited and outrageous price increase legal? (2) Can this price increase be refused? (3) Now he wants to use white rice as a basis for rent. If the second item cannot be refused, can I pay according to the official rice price? (4) Can I file a lawsuit with the court as a last resort?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Chuan Kuangling] (1) The rent for houses in urban areas is limited to 10% of the declared total value of the land and buildings per annum and cannot be arbitrarily increased. (2) You can legally refuse. (3) The Municipal Government has explicitly prohibited changing the rent payment to rice. (4) The parties may petition the court to increase or decrease the rent.</p>

<h3>The Pacific Two Years After the War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>(Translator's Note) The author of this article, Bob Bloomber, is an American war correspondent. He traveled to various islands with the military during the Pacific War. Two years after the war, he revisited these places and was filled with many emotions, leading him to write this article.</p>
<p>I recently returned from a 30,000-mile journey in the Pacific, a ghostly trip. Having served as a war correspondent in the Pacific, I thought I was very familiar with the endless azure sea, but I was wrong. I couldn't find the landmarks, the cemetery on Wake Island, and I got lost on Okinawa. I couldn't accurately locate any of them. The tides and jungles blurred my memories. I felt alone and wondered if I could bring myself to leave this place. Below are my observations and experiences at Pacific outposts:</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor: We arrived in Honolulu on a Sunday—a Sunday as peaceful as the day of Pearl Harbor (the day of the Japanese sneak attack). We cherish a photo of the chaotic Pearl Harbor, with ships engulfed in smoke and flames, and no one on land able to take emergency measures. Now, over five hundred warships are quietly docked in the harbor. At the same location as in the photo, a destroyer is slowly patrolling the sea. The "China" is docked at the pier. On the shore, there are only a few military vehicles. Everything indicates peace. This diamond-like city is gradually returning to its pre-war rhythm.</p>
<p>Tarawa: Three days later, our plane landed on Tarawa. In one corner of the island, I found what used to be rubble, scorched earth, and corpses everywhere, a truly unbearable sight. Today, this place has greatly changed. Officials stroll along the beach, filled with a peaceful and happy atmosphere. Only one Japanese tank is half-submerged on the beach. Some of Tarawa's desolation remains daunting. This is the only island we encountered that still needs assistance. A few newly planted palm trees replace the ones destroyed by the war.</p>
<p>Saipan: We found this place to be a paradise in the Pacific. I once witnessed the takeoff and landing of B-29 planes at the airfield here. Revisiting it today, it feels completely different. It is no longer a base for attacking Japan, and there are no large groups of aircraft to be seen. Except for a few rubber tires, no traces of war can be found. Saipan has been quickly rebuilt.</p>
<p>Guam: During the war, this was the site of a "hide-and-seek" game between American and Japanese forces. Bunkers and caves have now been transformed into wide highways, with jeeps driving endlessly. During the Japanese occupation, only 24,000 Guam residents survived. They are now diligently engaged in the restoration of Guam under the supervision of the military government, developing it into a new Pearl Harbor in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Manila: Manila suffered the most severe destruction during the war, but its post-war reconstruction has been quite rapid. Although 60 percent is still in ruins, large-scale construction plans have already begun. Filipinos feel that they fought side by side with the American forces during the war, making the greatest sacrifices, and should receive the greatest American assistance after the war.</p>
<p>Okinawa: This island, where the fighting was most intense, was almost fought inch by inch, with every foot of land subjected to a desperate battle, even a broken church. When I came here for the second time, the church had not yet been completely restored. An American soldier told me that there was nothing depressing about this place.</p>
<p>Tokyo: The capital of Japan has clearly undergone a great change. I once entered Tokyo with other journalists before the occupying forces arrived. At that time, our impression was of chaos, desolation, and disorder. This time, I came to Tokyo again. Overlooking the entire city from a high building, what entered my eyes were modern buildings, neat streets, and beautiful gardens. Today, Tokyo's cultural development has reached its peak. Who would have thought that Tokyo had suffered countless bombings during the war! I saw American soldiers selling souvenirs on the streets of Tokyo, and I also saw American military police and Japanese police jointly directing traffic.</p>
<p>Hiroshima: The end of our journey was Hiroshima. I clearly remember the scene of entering Hiroshima shortly after the atomic bomb was dropped: the faces of the survivors struggling to survive, an old woman digging through debris in broken tiles, like a bald tree in a dead city. The transformation of Hiroshima surprised me greatly. More than 50,000 houses have been built, and trams and buses are running in the city. Hiroshima has fully recovered its vitality. I asked an old man why he came to Hiroshima. He said, "This is my home." Yes, everyone has his home, so I hurriedly concluded this long journey through the Pacific.</p>
<p>(Translated on the Victory Day of September 3rd)</p>
<p>Translator's Note: The current state of the Pacific two years after the war is deeply moving. In particular, Tokyo and Hiroshima offer us very profound insights. Others have already moved forward, and we must catch up.</p>
<h3>The Ghost Festival</h3>
<p>— (Recorded from this newspaper on August 31st, Guangxu Year 19)</p>
<p>The seventh month is the month of ghosts, and many neighborhoods are holding the annual Ghost Festival again. This is how it is now, but fifty years ago, it was naturally even more valued.</p>
<p>"The water and rice bag industry in this port held a grand Ghost Festival a few days ago. In the evening, they arranged a full set of ceremonial items and paraded around. There was a five-colored dragon lantern, with scales and armor looking lifelike; several pairs of illuminated signs, shining brightly; a raised platform, with people dressed up as characters from stories; a flower boat, with clear singing answering each other, as if touring the West Lake. Ten 'free and easy' fans, several 'ten thousand people' banners, eight parasols, with candles burning in the middle, creating the illusion of an open city that never sleeps. Led by several monks, they circled around the Great East Gate, Da Shu, Yiqing Bridge, Temple East, and other places, before returning to the guildhall. When they reached the Small East Gate, some of the attendants burned paper money along the way. Suddenly, two beggars, A and B, rushed over, vying to grab the ashes. A was as strong as an ox, not allowing B to take anything. B questioned him, and A rubbed his palms and repeatedly slapped B's face, causing B to bleed from the mouth. B immediately fell to the ground, shouting for help. Pedestrians stopped to watch, not understanding what was happening. They asked what was going on. B recounted the events. A certain C, feeling indignant, stepped forward to drive A away, but A had already disappeared without a trace."</p>
<p>The Ghost Festival is originally a superstitious activity, costing money and effort. Fifty years ago in China, when science was not prevalent, there might have been some justification for such actions, but even then, upright gentlemen did not approve. Now, in the 1950s of the twentieth century, atomic energy has begun to be applied, yet such superstitious actions are still being performed, which is extremely foolish. Moreover, with the smoke of war still lingering, the rubble not yet cleared, and severe floods occurring, it is even more inappropriate to use useful money for such useless activities.

<h3>Utopia on Ice</h3>
<p>— Ming Sen</p>
<p>People are always dreaming of a "Utopia" in the world, where there are no armies, no fortresses, no unemployment, no illiteracy, no hunger, no cold, and no criminals. Well, there is indeed such a place in the world, and it has existed for some time.</p>
<p>This place is called the "Republic of Iceland." It has no army, navy, air force, or any military organization; everyone has a job; its budget is balanced; every adult man and woman and school-age child can read and write.</p>
<p>If it is said that there are no criminals in this island nation, it may not be entirely accurate. Petty theft sometimes occurs, but the serious crimes that plague other countries are extremely rare. Iceland's most recent murder occurred in 1928. A small thief killed the owner of something he stole. Even after twenty years, people are still talking about it.</p>
<p>Regarding the merits of this country, consider this fact: Iceland is currently the only country in the world that is not requesting loans from the United States. During World War II, the American soldiers stationed in the country reportedly could not find a single "Jeep girl" to socialize with.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, Iceland's climate is quite mild. Although it is high up in the Arctic Circle and is sometimes surrounded by ice floes and glaciers, its coast is warmed by the "Gulf Stream." Therefore, its winters are similar to those of Philadelphia in the United States. Its summers—June, July, and August—sometimes see the thermometer rise to the seventies. Its average annual temperature is 39.4 degrees.</p>
<p>However, one thing about Iceland is indeed very peculiar: due to its location so far north, its winters are almost entirely dark, and its summers are entirely daylight. In the summer, Icelanders follow the clock—not going to sleep when it gets dark, because the nights are as bright as the mornings. In midwinter, there are only about four hours of daylight in a 24-hour day.</p>
<p>Many people think that most of the residents of Iceland live in igloos under accumulated snow, like primitive Eskimos. In fact, not only is this not the case now, but it never has been. In the early ninth century AD, some Irish monks came to the island to escape the secularity of their homeland. About seventy or eighty years later, adventurers from the Scandinavian Peninsula began to arrive in Iceland. The first to settle there was a Norwegian named Ingólfr Arnarson. He carried the pillars for building his house with him; when he saw Iceland, he threw them into the sea, saying that he would settle at the place where they washed ashore. He later named the place where he built his home "Reykjavík," which is the location of Iceland's capital today, with a current population of 48,000.</p>
<p>So many people migrated to the island following Arnarson that within sixty years, all habitable land was filled. In fact, it was so crowded that the Irish monks found it too noisy and abandoned Iceland. The current Icelanders are white, blonde, blue-eyed, and of robust build, and could pass for people from the American Midwest.</p>
<p>Fishing is the main source of livelihood for Icelanders. Its seas are full of sharks, herring, crabs, cod, haddock, and even whales. At one time, Iceland was one of the largest fishing nations in the world; although many of its ships were destroyed during the war, it still hopes to restore its former prominence. Its two major industries are the refining of fish oil and fish meat.</p>
<p>How much Icelanders love learning can be seen in this fact: about 30,000 people of Icelandic descent live in the United States and Canada—because the opportunities to make a living using knowledge are greater in these places than in Iceland—and almost all of these people are "freelancers," such as doctors, lawyers, teachers...</p>

<h3>Miscellany in America</h3>
<p>Xu Yuan</p>
<p>Many Americans build houses without consulting carpenters or bricklayers, but they themselves do not run carpentry or bricklaying businesses. Carpenters and bricklayers in America are quite expensive, so most people are unwilling to bother them, preferring to do it themselves. Building a house in America is not a difficult task. The blueprints are readily available. You only need to choose a suitable one from a building magazine, and then go to the materials company to order the materials. Door frames, windows, roofs, and floors are all available in stock. The sizes are fixed. Call a truck to bring the ready-made materials back, and assemble them according to the ready-made blueprints and instructions. Hammer here, add a nail there, and a small bungalow with four or five rooms can be built in three or four days. Then, make a phone call to the furniture company, and in a while, all the furniture, including the mirror frames, will be delivered. If you want to save even more, you can buy unfinished furniture and paint it yourself. This unfinished furniture is more than half the price of finished furniture. A small bedside table only costs nine dollars, and the unfinished furniture has fewer blemishes, so you can choose as you like. American women, in addition to managing household affairs, put on work clothes in their spare time, paint floors, whitewash walls, wash cars, and feed cattle and sheep, and are proficient in almost everything. After finishing work, they immediately dress up in flamboyant clothes, looking beautiful and charming. Some Chinese women are not good at needlework but are proficient in drinking, gambling, dancing, and socializing. Others wear coarse clothes and skirts, completely becoming an old nanny type, but there is little flexibility. A standard woman should be a combination of a noble lady and a sacred worker, a lady when going out, a virtuous wife at home, and a romantic companion at night. I do not agree with Hitler's "women back to the kitchen," but I advocate that they often go to the kitchen, and not eat out or drink tea at restaurants every day. (50)</p>
<h3>Save Traffic</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Military vehicles "intersect," roads "do not pass,"</p>
<p>Competing for light, fearing to be behind, a chaotic commotion;</p>
<p>Passersby are seen as ant-like lives,</p>
<p>"Save Traffic" is infinitely meaningful!</p>
<p>The streets of Shanghai are "intersected and impassable" because there are too many vehicles, and everyone is "competing to be first and fearing to be behind," "rushing and colliding," viewing passersby as not even "worth an ant's life." Now the authorities are holding the "Double Ninth Traffic Festival." "Double Ninth" is homophonous with "Save, Save." With the current chaotic traffic order and the daily increase in deaths under the wheels, "Double Ninth Traffic" is better said as "Save Traffic."</p>
<p>Science Essay</p>
<h3>Hermit Crab</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xingchu</p>
<p>There are people selling "Taiwan Field Snails" by the roadside, asking a very high price, five thousand yuan per piece. Curious people buy them back to raise, store them in glass tanks, add yellow sand, change the water frequently, and feed them food, so they can live for a long time, which is quite elegant. In fact, its grand name is "Hermit Crab," also called "Parasitic Crab," or "Nest Snail," also called "Bochan," commonly known as "Crab Snail."</p>
<p>Hermit crabs are the most common and most interesting animals on the seashore. People who visit the beach for the first time see something in the pool, clearly an empty shell of a jade corn snail or a textured snail, suddenly a hermit crab's leg stretches out, shakes, and crawls away, and they are very happy and very surprised, and they can't forget it for a long time. An arthropod actually uses a mollusk's shell to defend itself, which is indeed very strange. But once we see the tail of a hermit crab, we understand why it has to live in something else to protect its life. It is really because the tail is too soft and too drooping, so it needs to rely on something else for defense, in order to reproduce.</p>
<p>If you carefully observe a hermit crab, you can't help but admire it. They are both alert and agile. Although they carry a heavy shell, they still move very nimbly. They like to fight, and sometimes one can forcibly pull another out of its shell and occupy it. Sometimes they wait there for a neighboring friend, and if they risk leaving the shell far away, they will unceremoniously occupy it, shrink into the depths of the shell, and close the door tightly. When the friend who went out comes back and sees this tragedy, there is nothing they can do but find another shell. When they are fighting, or confronting foreign races, they often lose a limb, or damage a limb, but it doesn't matter, because like many crustaceans, the next time they shed their shell, that is, when they change their outer skin, they will always regrow a complete limb.</p>
<p>In peacetime, the hermit crab first carefully stretches out its head, revealing its stalked eyes, short and trembling antennae, (the base of which has a balancer) and long and lively antennae. Then the claws are revealed, the right claw is always much larger than the left. Then there are two pairs of long legs for walking, and the other two pairs are short and not exposed. The tip of the tail has a pair of strong appendages like sickles, which are fastened to the borrowed shell, very tightly. The remaining tail appendages are only on the left side. It is said that males have three and are small, and females have four, the first three are strong and used to hold the released eggs. It is destined to move its two pairs of legs quite fast, but if it encounters obstacles, it immediately shrinks back, still like a snail shell. The speed of this reflexive return is extraordinary. Another action that should not be missed is moving from an old shell into a new shell. When it finds a satisfactory new home, it will suddenly move in, as fast as lightning. Ordinary hermit crabs change multiple homes during their lives as they grow larger.</p>
<p>The fertilized eggs of the hermit crab are adhered to the bristles on the second, third, and fourth abdominal limbs of the female, forming a purple mass, where they develop, regardless of the season. The hatched young are small, free-swimming larvae. The female closely steps out of the borrowed shell, exposing a part of her body, and brushes the laid seedlings into the water, which must go through four free-swimming periods (water flea body), which involves the process of molting, and then to a short, strange dimorphic phase, called silver-gray larvae. These larvae live on the seabed during the day and swim to the surface of the sea at night. In a few days, they will grow all the characteristics of a hermit crab.</p>
<p>Hermit crabs can eat many kinds of things, their appetite is huge, and there is almost nothing they don't eat. They love to eat animals, whether dead or alive, they eat them frantically. Sometimes they also eat seaweed. The large claws are used to grab food and send it into the mouth, and then to the jaws and gill feet, which tear or crush the food, and then the food passes into a strange sand sac for digestion.</p>
<p>Regarding the hermit crab's eating, there is another strange thing, that is, there is often a kind of sea worm called "Sesame Worm," which lives in the cracks and hidden places of the shell borrowed by the hermit crab, and usually does not eat or move. When the hermit crab eats, it comes out to share the scraps of food that fall from its mouth. In some places, fishermen even specialize in catching "Sesame Worms" as bait for catching "Hermit Crabs."</p>
