<h3>國務會議通過要案　大選投票展期一月　各黨參加地方民意機構</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京廿六電〕國大代表選舉之投票日期，決定延展一個月。此案經選總提交國府後，廿六日晨國務會議予以通過。按國大投票期原定為十月廿一日至廿三日，頃以選務進程上尚有若干困難（如綏靖區選舉之阻礙及政黨提名之尚未完成等問題），投票期延至十一月廿一日至廿三日舉行。據悉，綏區選務問題於會中亦經討論，朱收復匪區之選舉應如何進行，尚未作決定，已收復之綏　區之選務，則照常進行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕民。靑兩黨於參加中央政府之後，現繼之提出要求參加地方民意機構。此事業由兩黨府委徐傅霖，戢翼翹，胡海門，余家菊，曾琦廿六日在國務會議中提出修改各省市縣參議會法規，遴選各黨人士參加之提案一件，業經國務會議通過，送立院根據原則辦理。原提案稱：査施政方針第十二條「各省市縣之參會或臨參會儘量由各黨派及無黨派人士共同參加」，又査監委之選舉日期極近，而選舉法規定監委候選人須有參議員五人以上之提名，現在各黨雖參加政府，但因各省市縣之參會早經成立，各黨人士尚未有一人依據施政方針第十二條之商定參加各省市縣之參曾，以致各黨對於監委之選舉，依法無提名之入，且各參會之滿期者又已公布延期。在現階段中，尚朱有改選之可能，則各黨人士之參加省市縣之參會，一時無法進行，似對於施政方針第十二條旣有未符，而對監委之選舉亦無從辦起。擬請依據施政方針第十二條之原則，由立院修改各省市縣參會及臨參會法規，用遴　方式，遴選各黨人士共同參加各省市縣參會或臨參會。至於人數擬爲：省或院轄市爲十五人至廿人，縣或省轄市爲五人至十人。</p>

<h3>重慶委員長辦公地點　捐予教會設遺族小學　·並非主席夫婦私有產業</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕査本社前日所發紐約來電，內稱蔣主席夫婦將重慶附近「黃山」地產一百英畝石砌房屋廿棟，作爲戰時孤兒之學校及家園、並交陳文淵會督負責。茲探悉，該處房屋地產並非主席夫婦私人所有，而係前軍事委員會委員長辦公之地點，共佔山地二百餘畝，房屋大小計十幢，皆係戰時臨時建築者。勝利以後，政府還都，委員長鍳於敎會在戰時服務之熱誠及重慶市民在抗戰期間　受空襲之災害，造成無數孤兒，而軍委會又已結束，乃建議政府，將該處地產捐與中華全國基督敎協進會，並委託其設立敎堂，辦理遺族小為基金，至聯合社　二日所傳主席夫婦捐私產萬餘畝與美金五萬元一節，則賢愚事實不符。</p>
<h3>從政黨人過去黨務資歷　銓叙部應予承認　國務會討論後原則通過</h3>

<h3>斯揣克主張放棄日賠償　我國各方極為不滿　我「賠償與歸還委會」在束京成立</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕關於日本賠償問題，久延未決，早爲國人所懷疑，自美國方面最近發表斯揣克建議後，已益引起我國各方之不滿。茲據有關方面人士稱，本年內兩度赴日協助盟軍總部處理日本賠償問題之美國七人委員會主席斯揣克，最近於「美國雜誌」上發表「報復即浪費」一文，對於日本賠償問題，竟主張美國應放棄鮑萊計劃，推翻遠東委員會有關賠償之決議。此種論調與目前盟軍總部對賠償所採之遲延態度，以及其姑息並扶植日本之策略，似可互相印證，而於盟國對日賠償之要求，亦多不利影響，爰將該文要點誌後，以喚起國人注意與警惕。斯氏首先引述對德賠償之經騐謂，美國一而允許蘇聯拆遷工業設備及船舶，一面復撥　款以匡助德國戰後經濟。此種現象寶甚矛盾，故主張對日賠償應愼重處理，以免重蹈覆轍。並謂，美國並不需要德國及日本工廠，惟應鼓勵此兩國自給自足，並生產其所需以外之物品。如此，美國不但可毋須再　救濟，且可使美國工廠及農民獲得市塲。史氏復稱：「鮑萊計劃對摧毀日本經濟，從而加重美國救濟之負担」，並暗示麥帥實不滿遠束委員會根據鮑萊計劃所作之決議，希望加以改變，故對業經指定拆遷之一一零零座工廠，仍准暫時啓用其中之七零零座。史氏續述其調査結果稱：「縱令目前所有設備留有日本，日本亦難再行從事戰爭。遠東委員會之政策，要求鉅額賠償，勢必別起日本經濟崩潰與今後不斷之經濟需要」。故其結論爲：「遠東委員會之決議應于推翻，而在和約中置日本於安定之經濟基礎上，傳充實其生產能力」云。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿六日電〕我駐日代表團所設置之「中國賠償與歸還五人委員會」于廿一日正式成立，完全負責賠償與被掠之財產歸還事宜。該會委員或將增至廿至廿五人，並聘請十五至　名技術助鉀員，代表團之經濟與科學組組長吳半農，兼該委員主委，王樹皋，李　琛，周茂柏與　崇孔四人爲委員。</p>

<h3>核發子備外匯貨物證當局正擬議辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕滬市商會　滬市進出口商業同業公會等十六團體，為請核發自卑外匯登記貨品許可證，特推代表壽景偉等十六人於六日晨乘車抵京，問題頃正擬議辦法，決於短期內解決，聞此短期或不至超過十日。壽等向參會，全經會，財部請願所獲結果亦同。壽等一行廿六日夜車返滬。據壽氏稱，八月廿一日轍出入管理委會公告：「凡八月十六日前已裝運或到埠之貨。准予先行發記，而十六日以後運出者，將按官價外匯收購或強迫運離口岸，並取消該商執照」，但商人獲悉此項公告時，即使急電國外停止裝運，亦已不及。十六日至廿一日間已經裝船起遝之貨物亦無法辦理，且國外廠商並非設於海口，如貨物已由廠址運至口岸，船隻雖未起行而艙位等皆已先行訂定或到達口岸候輪裝運，種種準備業已完成，而無法止裝，故特提兩項要求：　自備外匯之已登記物資合於現行貿易管制辦法其屬於准許進口之項目者，請迅即補發許可證，傳得早日報關輸入；其屬於禁止進口之項目者，自當禁止進口。　將已定貨物裝船日期寬展至九月底止，由廠商及進口商提供證件補行登記，予以放行。現未領許可證之自備外匯到滬貨物，大部份爲機器，鋼鐵，五金，顏料，紙張，橡膠及化學原料等，其中或為生產器材或工業原料，滬日用必需品，其來源約有下列數端：爲在去年十一月十七日貿易管制辦法頒佈以前之定貨，一爲　管委會一度規定每周每家進口商可得二千美元辦法之廢止，一爲四月間自備外匯一度開放，一爲八月廿一日新貿易辦法公佈前，政府未硬性規定進口商必須先取得許可證始可向國外訂貨，經此一再累積，致達總値七千萬元之多。</p>

<h3>王寵惠在京談　美蘇對壘僵局　可能延續至三五十年</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕外交權威府委王寵惠，廿六日對本報記者暢論世界大局，結論稱：目前業已形成美，蘇兩大對壘之僵局，可能延續三十年，五十年然「經騐爲最佳之敎師」，若干非說理可獲解決之癥結，可於經騐若干困難敎，吾人之外交無所謂親美或親蘇，亦決不願從中漁利，就事論事，義之所在，必有中國，吾人容或於此事開罪美國，而於另一事開罪蘇聯，然此絕非親　或親蘇之謂，蓋吾人爲選擇公理正義，亦可能並美，蘇而齊開罪之。渠認爲：王外長出國前後所發言論及所採措施，均爲獨立外交之長現。且較以出主動而進取。對於聯合國大會，渠預言除非有奇跡出現，能獲得協議者僅次要問題而已。至於重大爭執，因涉及主義及思想，恐不易有解決希望。王氏就最近數年之大局稱，聯合國於戰爭期問有共同恐懼之敵人，英美日多讓步精神，故可合作，共同贏得勝利，戰後共同恐懼目標消失，英美亦不願繼續過多之讓步，蘇聯安全感特重，加以主義　溝間隙，兩大　　於焉形成，而至有如今急切不得打開之僵局，然渠信此大局不過爲僵局，舉世之厭戰心理，可消弭兵戎相見之狠心。現聯大開會情形表而似無和諧可言，然各將眞話坦率道出，實爲可　現象，此爲聯合國機構勝於國際聯盟之重要點。國聯表面當　和諧，實際權　欺詐，爲其失敗主因，聯合國機構矩期間雖難有極大成效，然已種下好因，今後僵持之雙方得經騐之敎訓，於發現「若干部份解決勝於毫無解決」之至理時，即爲僵局解決之始。</p>

<h3>陳誠勵精求治　東北面目一新　人心清晰光明</h3>
<p>〔中央社潘陽廿六日電〕東北自行　陳　主任　任后，力本〔務本〕精神，對各種不全法與不合理之現象，大力闊斧，迅速　辦，兩旬來，已使過去紊亂形勢，又納入正軌，沉　沉悶之東北局勢，與悵惘之東北人心，頓現清晰光明。記者茲根據事實，將出水芙蓉氏在東北之成就，分述如次。</p>
<p>整飭軍紀</p>
<p>陳氏以接受民眾要求，首先整飭軍風紀，對於過去有不　軍人強占公私房屋，侵害百姓，嚴禁士兵經商牟利，貪污舞弊，　扣車輛與假借名義，招搖募兵，以及不循正規開辦報紙，舞場，電影院等行為，均已極力　正，對於貪污舞弊人員，已分別嚴辦，并獎勵人民檢舉或密告貪污案件，禁止公務人員　　商業，不論其背景如何，違者重處。</p>
<p>裁并積極</p>
<p>光復以來之東北行政機構，　雜紊亂，頗受中央暨地方若干人士之指責，陳　主任於蒞任伊始，即采納各方意見，將不必要機關，予以裁并，如命令將東北敵偽事業資產統一接收委會，東北生產管理局，東北房地產管理局三機關，改并為東北區敵偽資產處理局，將各機關所接收之敵偽事業資產，分別性質，或歸中央，或　給地方機關接管，或發還人民，或標售民營，處理局內　設秘書，會計兩室，與審議估價兩委員會，該局於十月初即可成立。</p>
<p>人盡其用</p>
<p>東北行　原附設政治與經濟兩委員會，刻為增加行政效能，業經中央決定將上述兩委員會合并為政務委員會，對於尚未接收各省市政府，亦予縮編，并令前進接近各該省區地方，準備接收，其編馀人員，同將編為政治工作大隊，并　予調練，派赴各地工作，俾使人才盡得其用。故陳兼主任之簡化政策，其意義不在簡化行政機構，而在增加政治效能，其縮編目的，不是裁員，而是動員。</p>
<p>兩年以來之敵　　　，幾　少　人占用，近來有若干人員，　將所據政府　　，私自出項，從中取利，陳兼主任已命令查禁，其出項者，項費沒收，受項者，加倍懲罰，　　則相作救濟災民之用。</p>
<p>嚴防逃資</p>
<p>又近來因東北形勢　變，非　利得已難活　，致大批官僚與市儈，攜鑫粉粉企圖逃避關內，自陳氏蒞任之后，　往國內東北流通券，有十五億馀，而嚴近數日內，　　　往關內流通券，竟　　六億元之鉅，其中不免有貪污所得，與非法利潤，均　東北民衆　血，陳兼主任當即召集有關機關主管人員，飭令澈查，如有上述非法資金逃避，即予沒收，充作救濟難民之用，并商定　　審核辦法，合理限制資金外流。</p>
<p>以身作則</p>
<p>陳氏個人，以身作則，　飭僚　，力除頹唐風氣，本人舉行　內食宿，俾便利辦公，并免浪費時間，與生活消耗，并無自行　作起，所有各　官佐，均須準時進退，各處長以上人員，實行聯合佃公，所有重要事件，即時處理，毫無停滯，并提倡節約，不盛宴　客，不作　贈，不以紙煙招待來賓，每月節馀，用以補助兵役伙食，并禁止公務人員有賭博及跳舞等不正當娛樂行為。</p>
<p>陳兼主任有人首重品德才器，而不論久　關系，亦不　重資歷，如屬有為有守，　才實能之士，得于不次　用，故各僚　，多深知感舊，罷勉從公。</p>

<h3>紡織會議后的實行問題</h3>
<p>第二屆全國紡織業聯合會甫於本月廿二日閉幕，經濟部召集的全國紡織工業生產會議，又於廿五日開幕，　　三日，定於本日結束。這可　紡織業關系之重要，與全國上下對此之重視。</p>
<p>紡織業聯合會提案凡七十二起，生產會議的提案，凡一百零一起；自原料，機械，技術，運銷，以及如何提高生產效率，減輕制造成本，劃品質標準等問題，皆有詳盡的建設，討論，與議決。如果能自坐而　，進於起而行，行而果，則在不久的將來，所謂一千萬枚紡　，三十二萬臺織機，二千五百萬擔棉花的生產，自不難循序漸進，日起有功，　到我們預期的效果。國父曾說過：行之非　，　之維艱。政府與工商界各方面，既然認定了目標，通力合作，共向　總目標　進，則　行期問，　　　多，終不難打破難　，完成這項重大的使命。</p>
<p>我們對於紡織業，具有天時，地利，人和這三大優越條件。</p>
<p>大　現前增產的困難，其原因雖不止一端，而要以配合不上這一點為最重要。例如紡織廠限於動力，缺乏配件；毛紡織業缺乏原料，國產羊毛，運輸不　；機械制造這廠扼於資金，無法開展；進口限額，限於外匯頭寸，不易大量增加；以及高利貸與高工資的壓迫，運銷限制的未盡合理等等，皆是目下重大的障礙，亦是官商各方面所最感棘手的問題。</p>
<p>不過困難雖多，要非無可解救，只須認定重點，在通力合作　大前提下，盡可權衡綏急，斟酌輕重，予以全部或局部的解決。所可扼腕的，是此方急待處置，而彼方或尚存漠視，加以　　不一，牽制太多，少數人更急於近利，別具用心，以致算盤打得太緊，副作用發生得太多，就不免左支右　，削弱了整個的力量，和擾亂了　定的計劃。</p>
<p>所以在　　的種種計劃，經過兩次會議　重的論和議決以后，我們　為最大的要求，仍在於大家對這　目標已否完全認識？　事的人是否大公無私，把握得住？假如認定，是項生產確是現前　　　的工業，現前的工業計劃，確應置其重心於紡織　一點，　　，精誠所至，金石為開，我們相信，決沒有難以克服的困難。</p>
<h3>節約用電暫緩禁舞</h3>
<p>上海市　　　第四次大會　昨已入時論階段，其論題當漸　　　注目。昨日大會　過　　　　辦法和　　　　，都經過熱烈的　論，而終於　得大多數的支持；這　是處理市政事　　　　　　　的明證，也是中國民主政治逐漸健全的一種新氣象。</p>
<p>本市　　，戰后供不應求，生產工業大受影響，而尤其每日下午六時至十時為甚。若長此不改，故任一般用戶浪費，則結果不是迫令工廠每月只做十八天工，就將迫使電力公司采用分區輸流停電辦法，以為應付。前者必更使生產受到打擊；后者將使市民普遍輸值“黑夜”，且更可招致妨礙治安的惡果。參議員鄭重辯論之后，修正通過了市長交議的簡約用電辦法，不失為負責任而賢明的舉措。除普通用戶每月以四十度為標準，并以本年三四五等三個月的最高用電量為限度外，其他商業用戶工業用戶及學校醫院等均有分別規定，大體都可行得通的。議眾中并特別強調機關用電一律收費尤為市民所樂聞。我們深愿大空共體時艱，注意增產，切實的自動的簡約用電，使得省下來的電力可以移用於發動機器生產物資之途。必須市民與政府　誠合作，然后政令可以收其大效，而市參議會適已盡其橋梁之責任。</p>
<p>至于禁舞，行政院雖有通令，但截至止前為止，中國尚無禁止跳舞的法律，則營業性的跳舞固尚不能目之為違法，　令禁止，質欠根據。若說為節約而禁舞，則交際舞與營業性的跳舞又有何分別？所應節約的，只是隨舞而有的外國飲料等等，與跳舞本身無干。何況本市為國際都市，舞場均領有政府的執照，恃此為生者，直接問接何止數萬人？目前時局動　，難民充盡街頭，失業者尚患無可安置，而舞女等等又一時未必即盡能轉業，何必定欲於此時制造更多的失業　？市政府固須舉行中央政令，而中央又一再迫促本月底勒令舞場停業，似乎難以　　。但我們知道中央正欲努力準簡行　，在　法上，應由中央立法或執行的事項都有明白列舉，　　　　一類，　非中央硬性的　　　行政　以內的事，應讓地方政府有權衡綏包，因地制宜之　。何況　　市　　地方自治的單位，而上海市　議會　　以后，又有　請中央　　　　并請市府　　禁　的決議，　民　　　，可想而知，為中區計，發政施仁，宜　其　者大者，辦於　　似可放寬一步，收回成命了。中央此時應該　辦的事多　，社會上比舞場更　到不知多少的東西也多哩，行政院　有大事要事可辦，想必不致於固執成見吧！</p>
<h3>出售國營事業　估價標準決定　方式分標售招股兩種</h3>

<h3>台省當局委托商業銀行　承做臺滬間匯款　酌收匯費手續費每日懸牌公告</h3>
<p>〔中央社臺北廿六日電〕臺灣省府三日前分布令取締臺幣兌換法幣之黑市場后，黑市雖無交易，然臺幣更見貶值，暗盤僅為臺幣一元合法幣四十九元，臺省當局今下午再度集議，另定新辦法，即自明日起，由臺灣銀行委托此間工商，彰化，及華面三家商業銀行公開承做臺滬間商業匯款，不限數額，匯率仍依官價一比七十二為準，然須酌收匯費及手續費，此項匯費及手續費之多少，每日由三銀行隨時懸牌公告，明日之匯費及手續費定為百分之廿五，即每臺幣一元二角五分折合法幣七十二元，亦即每臺幣一元實匯法幣五十七元六角。據臺灣銀行稱：此項辦法實行后，可使商業匯款獲得出路，同時可使臺幣黑市消減，并進而逐漸使臺幣之價值提高至一比七十二之規定。另據記者獲悉：臺灣銀行上海分行亦將以法幣六十元折合臺幣一元之比率，公開承做滬臺間匯款。</p>

<h3>英國向聯大正式宣佈　決退出巴勒斯坦　表示頗放棄委任統治權　阿拉伯聯盟國家堅決反對分治計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿六日廣播：五十五國聯大巴勒斯坦特別委員會，於今日標準時間十五時卅分（上海時間廿七日上午零時卅分）開會，英國代表即殖民大臣環斯宣稱，英國已決定完全退出巴勒斯坦，其後果如何，已無法顧及。渠繼稱，英國主張立即結束舊國際聯盟委任英國統治巴勒斯坦廿五年之權利。並云，巴勒斯坦之前途，現在聯合國之手中，荀無適常解決辦法，英國已決定儘早撤退其巴勒斯坦駐軍以及行政機稱云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿六日廣播：英殖民大臣瓊斯代表英帝國政府，對聯大委員會之長途跋涉，進行困難之調査工作，表示感謝。並謂，委員會曾提十二項一般性質之建議，其中十一項獲得該委會一致認可，另有一項則獲得多數認可。英國對十二項建議表示同意，而其第一項建議，即爲規定巴勒斯坦之委任統治，應儘早予以結束是也。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿五日電〕此間觀察家咸信出席聯大之英美代表團，均尚不願逮即宣布巴勒斯坦問題之最後政策。美國之政策所以尚未決定，蓋猶太在紐約州有極大勢力，在明年之總統選舉中，猶人之票數對於杜魯門或紐約州長杜威之獲勝，有重大影響。今杜威以及另一共和國候選人搭虎脫均已表示贊成巴勒斯坦調査委會之多數建議，即分治辦法，此固猶太復國派所贊成者。杜魯門顧及其本身之地位，自不得不審愼從事。</p>
<p>各國代表並指出聯大若通過分治辦法，尚有兩項問題須待解決：　在籌建猶阿兩國之過渡期間，由何人負巴勒斯坦之行政責任。　聯合國那幾國常供給執行聯大決議所需之軍隊。聯合國醫察軍旣尚未成立，軍隊自當由會員國個別供給，美國於第一次大戰後即拒絕接受巴勒斯坦之委治，自不欲派兵前往聖地。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕叙利亞已通知英國，謂阿拉伯問盟各國均不承認巴勒斯坦分治辦法。各該國總理並於上週舉行會議，擬對聯合國機購贊成分治之會員國，實施經濟抵制，埃及，沙地阿拉伯·伊拉克·葉門·外約坦及黎巴嫩等國，料將提出同樣警告。</p>
<h3>和平解決巴爾幹糾紛　美國提出新建議　阿保參加討論須附條件</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿六日電〕美國今日在巴爾幹爭端試騐投票中，已對蘇聯獲得決定的勝利，要求聯大設立一特別委員會，包括五大國在內，再謀制止希臘與其隣國間之長期衝突。美國並指斥受蘇聯支持之希臘鄰邦阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞及南斯拉夫三國，請大會判定其援助遊擊隊與希臘政府作戰之罪。大會政治委員會辦事迅速，首先考慮准許非會員國阿爾巴尼亞與保加利亞參加巴爾幹問題辯論之申請。美國表示同意，但須兩國保證於被邀參加希臘問題之討論時，必尊重憲章規定下和平解決爭端之義務。蘇聯集團則全部加以反對，謂大會不應束縛阿保兩國。委員會卒以卅八票對六票通過美國主張，阿拉伯民族各國棄權。</p>
<h3>藐視聯大決議南非受譴責　我代表劉鍇仗義執言</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿五日電〕南非代表勞倫斯，今日在聯大托管委會中，重申南非拒絕將西南非交由聯合國機構託管之意。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿五日電〕南非聯邦未能遵守上屆聯大決議，將西南非洲產於聯合國托管之下，今在托管委員會中，會遭受非殖民地國家之攻擊。中國代表劉錯同情非自治政府人民之運動，指責南非未能履行托管協定。劉氏指出，將以前委治之領土置於聯合國托管之下，乃管理國家道德上之義務，委治國現仍置身於托管制度之外，實乃不可原宥者。劉氏復稱，大會應授權托管理事會，考慮南非聯邦所提關於南非之情教，而不應授續托管委員會担責此項工作。今日首先對南非發動攻擊者爲印度，印代表指資南非藐視大會意志。</p>

<h3>蘇聯突向美國建議明春同撤韓境駐軍</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城廿六日電〕蘇聯首席代表希鐵科夫中將，本日在美蘇混合委員會第六十一次會議席上，突提議美蘇兩國駐韓軍隊於明年春由韓國撤退。希鐵科夫之提議大意謂。莫斯科三外長會議時，蘇聯主張韓國託治，但美國迄無誠意合作。蘇聯爲朝鮮之自由獨立，會到力求其實現，目下朝鮮人民均企求美蘇駐軍由朝鮮撤退，吾人認爲亟須滿足韓人之願望，乃提議美蘇軍隊於明春撤退，希美方對比即予答覆。</p>
<h3>杜魯門關切歐洲局勢　考慮作權宜援助　克萊頓估計需需款廿五億</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕杜魯門總統今稱：如欲維護並促進歐洲十六國之政治穩定與經濟復原，則美國務須施以迅速之「權宜援助」。渠稱：歐洲之緊急局面，刻有待於馬歇爾計劃之命運，美政府正擬不召開國會特別會議，而即行草擬援助西歐計劃，推此問題須由國會諸領袖決定之，渠定廿九日與彼等會晤。</p>
<p>杜總統不願估計權宜財政援助之費用，惟稱：副國務卿克萊頓已估値其數目達廿五億美元，國務院亦未予否認。總統並贊譽歐洲十六國巴黎會議報告之正式聲明謂：此對經濟合作，係一「重要而令人欣慰之第一步驟」。巴黎會議報告所述及之經濟復原問題，非但係歐洲政治與經濟安寗之關係所在，且係世界穩定和平之關鍵，該文件僅係初步報告，尚須交予美國加以謹愼審查與修訂，並與歐洲各專家共磋商，以擴大其範圍。杜氏又稱：渠所任命之三委會，已受命根據美國應付歐洲需要之能力，評定歐洲計　。</p>

<h3>德復興已具基礎美財長表示樂觀</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿五日電〕美財長史奈德今日下午離柏林赴巴黎，行前發表談話，謂德國局勢雖嚴重，但復興之基礎業已安置。渠云：余信德國在今後數年內茍能堅決苦幹，必能大布改進其經濟生活。據美軍區長官克萊稱，史奈德此行係為收集關於可否將德國列入馬歇爾援歐計劃內之情報。</p>
<h3>塔虎脫抨擊政府認為外交政策已鑄大錯堅決反對美國對外貸款</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓泰科瑪廿五日電〕共和黨參議員塔虎脫令日在此間世界學會發表演說，詳細闡明共和黨對於美國外交政策之立塲，抨擊政府在國際局勢中所抱「頑固哲學」鑄成大錯。據稱，以戰爭言，吾人雖獲勝利，以和平言，實已失敗。目前世界局勢危急，不下於一九四〇年時。僅麥帥佔領日本工作，聯合國機構之設立，以及最近巴西京城泛美聯防協定之簽訂等，帶來一綫光明。美國應即停止對全世界貸款，深信美國憑藉金錢必不能拯救世界。馬歇爾援歐計劃，應基於特殊借款原則，且以償付美國貨款等特殊用途爲限。對日和約必須立即締結，俾准許該國自給自足。吾人若使一國生活水準低於其他各國，則該國將能生產廉價貨物，在全世界各地與美國競爭。此即大西洋憲章原則所繫，美國政策當力求切實提高各國生活水準，雖戰敗國亦不能例外。</p>
<h3>前軸心五附庸國入會問題陷僵局安理會一場爭辯無結果</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿五日電〕安理會今對前五軸心附庸國要求加入聯合國之申請，重新予以考慮時，因英國指責蘇聯之行爲，爲「不正常之買賣行爲」，而再度形成僵局。安理會今晨係討論波蘭之建議，請安理會介紹養　　羅芬加入聯合國。蘇代表葛羅米柯表示謂，現在和約業已批准，渠願支持養大利之申請。不到一月前，渠會否決此項申請，但以介紹匈保羅芬四國加入爲條件。此點引起極大爭辯，多數會員國包括中·美·英三國，持相同立塲，要求對每一國家之申請分別考慮，而不應作整個之表決。萬氏（任安理會主席）最後終於同意大多數意見，旋即開始討論匈牙利之由請，美國對匈牙利現政府予以猛烈攻擊，而蘇聯則極力爲之辯護，結果無任何決定。安理會乃定廿九日再行討論。</p>

<h3>日參議院右派議員響應吉田新黨運動</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿六日電〕日本參議院右派議員所組之綠風會，因對日和會迫近眉睫，認爲時機成孰，決進行紀織政黨。日木前任首相即自由黨總裁吉田茂氏，與綠風會會長松平恒雄之間，今夏以來，已協議組織保守新黨問題，迄九月二日，吉田與松平之外，復加入民主黨名譽總裁幣原，參院外交委長佐藤尚武二名，舉行四巨頭會談，並表明樹立以對付和會之强力保守內閣爲目標之保守新黨。今日綠風會由新黨籌備人尾崎行雄等七名召開第一次會議，當即先行決定錄風會之政黨化，惟政黨之名稱及政綱等，則尚未發表。該黨黨魁以松平恒雄希望最大。但在約佔參議員半數之綠風會會議中，不滿在自由黨影響下組成政黨者，頗感不寗，聞已有一部份將加入社會民主兩黨者。</p>

<h3>參議員一致通過　請中央暫緩禁舞　大會表決時無舉手反對者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日下午舉行第五次會議，對本市簡約用電辦法及禁無問題二大議案，均有重要決定，且有詳盡熱烈之附論。</p>
<p>關於禁舞一案，參議員九十六人中以八十二票之數，通過決議「由本曾中述理由，請中央重行考慮禁舞明令，本市對此項明令謂市政府暫緩執行」。而當議長提付表決微詢有無反對前項決議時，參議員中無一人舉手。</p>
<p>討論開始，首先發表意見表示不必禁舞者爲一居住上海三十六年而從未同任何人跳過舞〕之余副職長寄　。徐氏說明不必禁舞之理由，有三點：　舞塲營業乃由政府及社會局核准者，若政府對業經准許之營業塲所突然加以禁止，則以後對任何營業之機構皆可禁止。　跳舞爲公開之娛樂，舞塲爲公衆塲所，如果公開之娛樂亦不許，則許多人勢必都流入不公開之娛樂處所。　上海失業人數極多，已失業者尚未設法救濟，豈可再增加失業人數。其他各參議員亦繼起反對禁舞，張志韓稱：上海之奢侈，應由政府負責，因奢侈品的進口，在在是造成這種風氣的原因。所謂簡約，乃節省外匯，如取之於國人，用之於國人，且間接救濟人民，則根本不應禁止。譬如以夏丹維一日收入一億多舞票來講，實可聽由當豪們踴躍輸將，問接增加抽稅收入，否則若企圖請財政局長向他們收稅，是一定辦不到的。</p>
<p>水祥雲謂「簡約事小，餓死事大」禁舞後不但舞女，舞業職工失業，且與舞應有關之各方如百貨商店，時裝公司等等失業的人將更多。</p>
<p>討論中途，參議員請吳開先局長報告禁舞後之救濟辦法。吳局長乃將市府以前公布之三點辦法說明，並謂本人深知禁舞後問題非常困難，本人係奉命辦理。當時即發生一小插曲，張志韓　問：政府既發表明令，市政府旣已接受，何以又要提參議會徵求意見？既　　詢民意，又何以尊重議會意見，豈不矛盾？吳局長當即報以妙語：一本人乃一任命官，並非民選，由中央任命，故必須對中央服從。但木人乃受民意機關所監督，故不能不尊重民意，因此一點也不矛盾」。王先靑認爲非但不應禁舞，而且要提倡跳舞，他說跳舞一見怪不怪，其怪自敗」。</p>
<p>後由女參議員田淑君對禁舞問題發表意見。田女士亦不主張禁舞，對舞女表示同情，希望禁舞暫緩三年後舉辦。繼由陶百川根據憲法說明禁舞問題乃屬人民立法而不在中央立法施圍內。政府發表明令不應牴觸憲法，若有牴觸則地方政府不負責任，不必服從中央，否則即成錯誤。故不僅關於禁舞，將來政府對類似之立法均應撤銷。但吳市長起立說明市政府對中央明令旣不能不執行，亦不可能暫緩執行。最後由潘議長集合各方意見，擬定上述議案，經大會通過。</p>
<h3>大會修正通過節約用電辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議員對於「節約用電」一案意見頗不一致。參會公用委員會前日審査結果，對節約用電表示贊成，但對市府擬定之節約用電辦法則曾加以修正。然昨日大會討論時，參議員中則有根本</p>
<p>反對</p>
<p>節約用電者，其理由亦頗多：路式導堅決反對，謂節電後徒然使若干査火表及管理員一皇帝」增加一筆收入。况市民納稅多種，連一點點水電享受權利都沒有，則何以得民心。楊撫生表示，大工業工廠用電雖屬重要，但其他工業，尤其是手工業如印刷所，排字房等均需用電燈電力者，不能節省。張中原並謂商店用電減少後，對於營業將受影響。</p>
<p>贊成</p>
<p>節電者則　多，朱文德表示：舞弊乃社會上一病態，不能因此病態即不談節電。此外，節電可增加生產，提高工作效率。發展工業增加生產必需要靠電力，商務發展與電力多少無關，商業不發達因人民購買力薄弱，決非因電燈裝得不漂亮而致營業收人减低。章祝三，張志韓亦列舉理由同意節電。嗣討論告一段落，議長先將是否根本反對節約用電一案先提付表決，結果反對者僅十二票，未通過。</p>
<h3>普通電力用戶四十度爲標準</h3>
<p>繼討論市長交議之節約用電辦法，對於小組會審査意見復加修正。決議原辦法（詳見九月九日本報第四版）第一條修正爲普通電燈電熱用戶用電量，以四十度爲標準，（同一戶名之電表合併計算），以本年三，四，五三個月之最高用電量爲限度。在標準以內電度照規定電價收費在標準以上限度以內部份，照規定電價二倍收費，超過限度以上部份，第一次照規定電價四倍處罰，第二次六倍處罰，（均包括木數在內）。第三次及三次以上除六倍外。得視情節　　，予以　電處分，</p>
<h3>補充四點　　此外小組會並在市府七辦法外補充四點，亦經大會加以修正決定：凡工廠已有發電設備者，限至本辦法通過後一個半月內發電，如不足需要時，再由電力公司供給用電。工廠發電供給自用者不予發電補貼費，如用時供給市民應用者，得酌予貼補。學校及有電療設備之醫師診所用電寬予優待。軍事機關用電應一律收費，請有關機關嚴格執行。市長意見　　吳市長對上述　　兩條中「工廠自備發電設備者」等項，向大會表示希望修正，仍給予補貼費，因工廠自備發電應加鼓勵，几其成木較電力公司供給者昂貴，盼給予貼補。但遭參議員反對。若干參議員認爲如中紡紗廠等皆有發電設備，雖其成本較高，但紗價日漲，稍加電力成本對實際收入損失甚少，故除非供給平民應用，不得貼補。以上修正及補充意見，經參議員一百十二人中一百十人之多數通過。　　又趙局長昨答覆參議員詢問「節約用電何時可解除？」稱：至明年新發電機到後即可解除，美商有一架發電一一萬五千瓩之新發電機業已到達。審查徵借愛儷園案四委會討論無結束　　〔本報訊〕市參議會工務，地政，財政，法規四委會，昨日上午聯席審査徵借哈同花園開放爲公園案。首由吳市畏報告與哈同花園業主交涉經過，略謂業主初則拒絕租借，後工務局主張徵收，卒因土地法上既無明確規定，抑亦無此一百二十一億元鉅額徵收金。根據羅迦陵第二遺囑，市府可得贈金二百萬元，當時約値哈同花園之半，若能根據此遺囑，則市府祗需徵收其一半。惟因業主方面不承認第二遺囑有效而未果。後經杜月笙，奚玉書，顧嘉棠調解，業主允捐獻基地十五畝，並在其慈善基金中撥十分之三，約美金四十五萬元建造圖書館云云，繼由潘議長解釋第三次大會中此案係根據第一次大會工字第一號提案，原案是「徵借」與「租借」，而非「徵收」，如必欲「徵收」，需另案討論。嗣諸議員紛紛發表意見，有主張徵收者，有主張接受捐獻者。至中午仍無結果，乃決交大會討論。伏波艦撞沉慘案戴儒林判處徒刑船舶碰撞後未盡救助義務　　〔本報訊〕伏彼號軍艦與海閩輪碰撞沉沒案，海閩輪船長戴儒林，因有殺人及過失致死案嫌疑，被提起公訴，昨晨在地院刑八庭由朱念慈庭長率同謝志英，鐘顯達二推事宣判：「戴儒林於船舶碰撞後未盡應行救助之義務，處有期徒刑一年二月，其餘部分無罪。」被告律師呈請交保不准　時旁聽之伏波艦少數死難官兵遺屬，猶嫌判刑不重，當庭大哭大鬧，並將請求檢察官再度提起公訴。綁架菲律賓華僑蘇萬雷四日受審　　〔本報訊〕綁架菲律賓華僑李孝錦之子　安泰匪黨首領蘇萬雷，自經警局捕獲後，即向地檢處提起公訴，定於下月四日開審。舞業願獻一日所得　　建議每月州義資一次　　〔木報訊〕昨日本市舞盛業推舉代表孫洪元，唐宗傑等五人，携一建議書赴市參議會呈交，該　內容係說明舞業爲響應當局節約運動，願於下月起每月舉行義賣一天，此一天中資方之全部營業收入，舞女之舞票，職工之小賬，及樂師之薪金，均將全部　齊呈獻參會分配，據估計本市二十九家舞廳，一日義賣可得三億元。筵席稅起征點決改為三萬元　　〔本報訊〕市參議會昨通過其他提案數起，　議長交議案「上海市酒業公會函請筵席稅起征點請照物價指數爲調整標準」，經大會決議起征點改爲三萬元。　金潤庠，嚴諤聲，劉靖基等臨時動議「請市府咨請財部解除支票不得抵用限制」案，決議通過。　陶百川等臨時動議「爲此次徵兵斗各區保長備賞艱苦，賢勞可念，擬請市政府擇優頒給獎狀或獎品以資激勸」案，通過。軍警待遇菲薄大會通過改善　　〔本報訊〕參會改善士兵警察待遇問題硏究委員會昨提出硏究結論數點，經大會通過：　本市軍警待遇實太菲薄，有改善必要。　改善之道，擬由本會於最短期內邀集本市各領袖團體商討籌募軍警福利事業基金若干億元，推派代表共同保管，其使用辦法另定。　籌募對象應集中於殷富，以免加重一般市民之負担。破獲套匯機關兩起抄出可疑函電帳冊　　最近本市私套外匯之風甚熾，警局經濟科，昨日依據截獲之秘密電報與密報，査獲具有重大嫌疑之私套外匯案二件：　吉祥街一一〇弄七號集和隆號，業務爲進出口，經理吳秉彝，最近有一電致其香港友人，電文爲「杞子四十箱」，警局於獲得此一電稿後，深致疑寶，乃於昨午派員前往檢査，査獲密碼簿，電報稿，信稿及賬册等數十本，並將吳秉彝及該號賬房陳伯年帶局訊問。吳招供私套外匯不諱，上月共套取約六億元，電文中所稱「杞子四十箱」，實爲「港匯四萬元」之暗號云，吳陳二犯已暫准交保。　仁記路一一九號三樓四十七號室光明進出口，經人密告有私套外匯情事，警局人員赴該處檢査，穫可疑之賬册及來往函件便條等甚夥，該行負責人陳紹言被帶局訊問，據供：該行係由渠與鄭愼百，倪曾祥等合夥經營，外匯來源一爲國外存款，二爲撥賬，三由中央銀行所供給，業務範圍頗爲寵大，該行私套外匯部份·將由中央銀行審核査獲之賬册後予以確定，陳紹言暫准交保。　　資方不接受條件海寗洋行昨罷工　　〔本報訊〕美商海寗洋行由我國防部收買，即將接收。該行二百餘長工及臨時工因恐被解僱，於日前向資方提出要求，發給解僱金六月及年賞二月，並其他倏件。資方未允，二百餘職工乃於前晚包圍廠方直至深夜昨日又實行罷工，現正由社會局勸導調解中。　　〔本報訊〕四行一局職工，因本月份待遇减低，而所提要求，迄未獲具體答覆，終於昨日中午，集體絕食一餐，表示「無聲的抗議」，惟仍照常工作。據行局方面負責人表示：四行一局職工，上下並無勞資階級之分，一體爲國家服務，性質與一般商業銀行逈異。各行局當局對職工目前處境艱困，甚表同情，惟亦愛莫能助。至職工方面所提要求，業已轉呈政府當局，聽候最後批示云。鐵駁爆炸慘案家屬懇求撫卹　　〔本報訊〕中國運輸公司七四九號鐵駁，於本月十七日下午四時五十分，在公和祥碼頭，因駁運化學品爆炸，老大胡益炳，水手阿四，二老大妻賣張氏三人失蹤，胡益炳妻受傷，各情業誌前報。聞水手阿四，及賈張氏屍體獲，其妻受傷輕微，早已痊愈，對其夫之屍首迄未撈獲，不免耿耿，又因尚有小孩三口，生計艱難，再三要求該公司救濟，昨午胡妻又帶領小孩三口，至該公司懇求撫卹，未獲要領，胡氏乃與三小孩坐守，聞至傍晚，該公司已允設法救濟。理由不定宣告無罪　　〔本報訊〕滬江大學學生羅覺華，因洩漏該校上學期學期考試試題，涉嫌被開除後，向地院控告該校訓道長耿元學及校工繆根元妨害名警，昨午經地院刑庭審結，以羅覺華理由不足，宣判被告耿元學及繆根元無罪。婦女討論禁舞問題　議決請政府延期一年　成立委員會協助舞女轉業　　〔本報訊〕本市舞女爲禁舞後生許瀕絕，特推派孫致敏，孟燕，沈麗芳，洪小萍，金美虹等五代表，於昨晨在舞業職業工會集合，往興中學會請市婦女會理事田淑君引導，前往東平路主席官邸普　蔣夫人，請予援助。田告以蔣夫人因事不克按見，市婦女會下午三時在新生活俱樂部舉行第二次理監事聯席會議，討論禁舞問題，巾央派有陳逸雲出席指導，可往列席參加。　　蔣夫人關懷　　婦女會理監聯席會會議席上，由金振玉任主席，說明開會意旨後，即請中央委員女參玫員陳逸雲致詞。陳稱日前在京曾與蔣夫人談及禁舞問題，蔣夫人對禁舞後舞女之出路甚爲關懷。惟因政府已定法令不能反對，且禁舞日期急迫，故蔣夫人甚望上海婦女能設法解決禁舞後舞女之善後問題。陳參政員並稱：常參政會開會張之江等參政員提出禁舞案時，渠會加反對，惟因力量不够，卒經大會通過云云。舞女代表金美虹繼報吿生活實際情形，聲稱伴舞為一種正當職業，如言跳舞爲傷風敗俗，則禁舞後，亦許有甚多舞女將被迫作更傷風敗俗之事。現本市各舞廳舞女多已自動實行節約，如政府不能收回禁舞成命，亦望能代爲安排好舞女之轉業問題。且禁舞後各舞女本身問題尚小，其平時賴以生活之家屬及賴以受敎育之弟妹或子女，亦將失去依賴及培植機會。嗣由與會各理監事相繼發表意見，對舞女處境甚表同情，咸望能妥籌解決。　　決議五點　　最後經討論議決：　請政府延長禁舞期限一年，在此期內不再增設舞廳，並不得再有舞女登記。舞女不用奢侈品，其服裝改用國貨。　由婦女會辦理職業學校及手工補習班，請政府撥助一部份經費，並請規定在目前舞票中加一成或二成作爲開辦經費。　由婦女會推派代表向中央及蔣夫人表達對禁舞問題意見。　請蔣夫人及中央婦女運動委員會，新運婦女指導委員會一致協助。　成立協助舞女轉業委員會，推選金振玉，田淑君，凌英貞，張紅薇，陸惠民，陳韶型，陸蘊茜，朱素萼，謝詠華，凌其愼，趙芝玫，凌其瑞，兪鴻羣，程海倫，李素珍等十五人爲委員。　　妾媳對簿公庭庭論調查決定　　〔本報訊〕巨奸梁鴻志伏法後，其財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外，業已沒收，惟大部份細軟金飾爲其數妾隱匿逃避，梁媳吳蔓音，女梁卓立，曾因向翁妾梁趙氏，梁丁氏，淸算財產，致發生糾紛。昨日下午對簿高院刑庭，四人均到，吳蔓音，梁卓立稱梁趙氏等擁有財產甚多，而對渠等之生活漠不關心。梁趙氏梁丁氏則稱，自勝利後家中即被査封，所携走者僅少數箱籠，迄今已將川罄，外傳擁有巨額財藍，實係誤會云云。當山庭上記明筆錄，俟調査後再作決定。　　奢華不是榮舉惡習應速革除節約運動宣傳會舉行大會　　〔本報訊〕本市節約運動宣傳大會，昨晨九時假體育館舉行，到各界代表千餘人。大會主席吳市長致詞：略稱節約是中國固有之美德，外人素贊國人忍苦，耐勞，自奮，節儉之精神，惟在戰後中國，特別是上海，奢侈風氣日甚，影響過去之節約美德。今日國內窮苦人及公務員，均已無約可節，然而上海還有許多人度着紙醉金迷的奢侈生活，此種風氣應迅速革除，使整個市民一致節約。吾人應忠告上海市民，奢華不是榮譽，而是恥辱，上海市民應切實實行節約，爲全國人民表率。潘議長致詞。略謂：上海節約宣傳開始實行，盼全市市民盡量勸導，督促社會，勵行節約，增加生產，减少消費，用社會力量，自動自發，補救當前危機，深盻每個市民在生活習慣上，盡量節約，完成節約運動。最後由宣司令，方主委等相繼演說，大會至午始散。該會復爲加强宜傳效能，使市民普遍認識節約意義起見，特於昨日起約請本市黨政軍首長，地方名流，輪流就本市大西路七號上海廣播電台播講。市長等發起組織　　〔本報訊〕吳市長，潘議長，方治，吳紹澍，張知本，査良鑑，吳開先，張曉崧，馬君碩及趙仰雄等，以憲法業經公布，厲行法治實爲目前當務之急，特發起組織中國行政法學會，以硏究中國行政法規之科學，及促進我法治與憲政之完成。警局行政處抽查羣玉坊　　〔本報訊〕本市警察局行政處長第三科吳科長，昨晚八時卅分，督率警訓所警官班學員七十三名，至老閘警分局所轄汕頭路羣玉坊抽査戶口，當由施分局長督同第一股股長劉錦麟，巡官林鐸警士十五名，會同前往，計抽査三·四·五·七·九·十·十一·十三·四九·五五·六一·六九·七九號等戶，至九時半結束，除帶回無照妓女十二名，按違警法處理並移送總局補領執照。盛毓度案審結候判　　〔本報訊〕盛宮保後裔盛毓度，日本京都帝大經濟系畢業，被控於淪陷期問，任工部局物資統制委員會委負，保甲指導委員會委員，物資統制處公會科首席顧問，日人岡崎總董協辦，該案昨在高院審結，定二十九日宣判。萬國藥房職員丁南方服毒死　　〔本報訊〕福州路萬國藥房職員丁南方，二十歲，家住柳河路十八號，不知如何，遽萌死念，於昨晨六時五十分許，清服安眠藥片自盡，經人發覺，用軍送入仁濟醫院，施治罔效，延至十時身死。　　學徒訴苦請求解答市府已設法改善不得再有凌虐行為　　〔本報訊〕市政府前日接自稱文具業一學徒呈函，陳訴生活苦狀，並列舉各項問題請求解答。市府鑒於我國工商業學徒制度，乃畸形契約行爲，其業師或店主對學徒關切備至，現若家人子弟者固所在多有，而恣意差使，不加體恤，視同奴役僕隸者，亦不乏其人。且學徒多屬童年，因工作繁重，營養不足，妨碍正常發育，影響身心健康，莫此爲甚，對此種違背人道主義之積習，亟應設法革除，以資改善。市政府已令警察局隨時取締凌虐學徒行爲，並令社會局轉飭各業公會通告所屬會員商號，對於學徒之待遇，務就各該號實際情形，迅即設法改善，不得囿於成見，再有摧殘凌虐之行爲。最後四天　申報助學金盼踴躍捐輸　　按照預定的計劃，「讓者助學金一在本月廿二日截止收款，因爲一部份慨任勸募熟心人士，認爲限期過於短促，爲了應付事實上的需要，在一度磋商後，我們決定將限期延長一個星期，到本月月底爲止。　　光陰駸駸的逝去，四天又已很快的過去了，連今天算在裏面，到月底還有四整天，在這四天裏面，我們殷切的希望社會上愛護靑年的人士，多多的捐助，務使這次「讀者助

<h3>堡艷壘屍　濟南發現離奇命案　繩勒刀斬血跡斑斑</h3>
<p>本報濟南廿三日航訊〕二十三日上午九時，濟南市經四路禪十路口，防禦工事保壘中，發現裸體少女艷屍一具，經警局法院派員到塲勘驗後，拘押嫌疑犯多人，案情離奇，正由當局縝密偵察中，茲報道其經過情形如次。</p>
<p>屍體發現未辨雌雄</p>
<p>濟南市經四路緯十路一五五號，新泰縣旅濟同鄕會，住有難民牛鼎臣，年五十九歲，於廿三日上午九時許，起身小便，因時正降雨，且身患癱病，不良於行，乃赴其門外所築防禦保壘內解手，詎行至堡壘中，突見有赤身屍體一具，常時未遑辨認是男是女，亦未小便，即趕急走出，告知其同鄕唐玉林，赴保甲長處報告，立由保甲長報告該管商西分局，局長鐘殿賓，即率官警趕赴出事地點，一面維持秩序，一面通知濟南地方法院。</p>
<p>年可雙十赤身裸體</p>
<p>記者聞訊，亦冒雨趕到，見堡壘內一女屍橫陳，剪髮天足，估其年齡，約可雙十，面龐俏麗，肌膚豐盈潔白，全身赤裸，屍體附近亦無衣物遺留，係一少女艷屍，不類風塵中人物，頸項正中，有一刀傷，約寸許，呈三角形，血跡點滴，項間並勒有白色布帶一條，口部用花布杜塞，其花布又似所着之下衣，兩目緊閉，眼皮呈紅色，此堡壘對面尚築一堡壘，兩者隔馬路東西相對峙。女屍係發現於路西堡壘中，惟在路束堡壘射擊口，發現藍色士林布女大衫一件，及靑布底鞋一雙，該堡壘臨街無門可通，門在某被服塲內，當由刑警折入被服廠査勘，則見保壘門口，堆積棉衣包甚多，衣包上灰塵重重，似未經人移動。警局因法院尚未派員勘驗，乃保存其原狀。是時雖在雨絲風片中，但竚觀者極衆。</p>
<p>法院派員到塲勘騐</p>
<p>至下午四時，法院檢察官秦碩甫·吳廷獻，書記官吳振三，及檢驗吏，法警等到塲勘驗，書驗得該女屍係先被用繩勒斃，後以刀斬致命，該女已非處女，但無姦情，復由被服廠進入堡壘，取出射擊口內衣物，除大衫布鞋外，尚有粉紅洋紗內衣一件，米色錢襪一雙，皆摺疊整齊，其上均無一血跡，繼又至新泰縣同鄕會內査勘，並令被服廠男女工頭詢問，均答稱並不認識死者。</p>
<p>拘押疑犯掩埋艷屍</p>
<p>法院響局會勘詢問後，對一干人證分別處理，當將濟南被服廠工人負責人張靜波，工人岑玉亭二人，因涉嫌較大，經通知廠主後，暫交防守司令部第三督察區隊長于經五看押，女工路秀英，王鳳英，亦令取保候訊。其餘發現人牛鼎臣，被服廠傳達長費勉，傳達李燕明，警長楊仁鈞等，均釋放，並因死者無人認領，由法院發給抬埋證，飭令地保掩埋。</p>

<h3>香港驚人巨刦　冒充水果店夥計打開保險箱</h3>
<p>〔本報香港廿五日航訊〕香港警務當局，對治安方面雖然十分注意，可是香港的匪徒，却愈幹愈兇，最近發生了一宗很有趣的刧案，某大商號的提款員，剛從銀號裏提到美金三萬元，不知如何被歹徒落了眼，一直跟到華人行的電梯裏，就在電梯上升的時候，拔出手槍，强令司機停駛，一面搶去美金三萬元，趕走了乘客，再從容不迫的乘原機下來，大踱步而去。美金三萬，合港幣要十六萬元，這是何等驚人的數目！警探雖然加緊査緝，至今依然毫無消息。</p>
<p>不料一波未平一波又起，昨天（九月廿四）上午九時五十分，蘇杭街又發生了一件驚人巨刧案，事主損失達港幣九萬元之多。蘇杭街九十四號三樓振益出入口莊，經營疋頭，已有多年歷史。在昨日上午九時五十分的時候，忽有三人冒充相熟的水菓店夥計，叩門送入生菓一筐，豈料門開以後，內中一人，忽然拿出手槍，另一人則拔出利刃，將全店人員驅往閣樓監視，一面勒勒店東打開保險櫃，將內中所存的黃金二百五十兩全數刧去，依照時價估計，價値在港幣九萬元以上，後來警察局派了大隊衝鋒隊趕到，可是歹徒早已遠屬了。</p>
<p>香港的巨刧案，往往發生在白晝，而且地點又往往在最繁盛的皇后道和德輔道，他們似乎故意和警察開玩笑，入們說香港是習險家的樂園，這裏正是一個好證明。（特約記者程志政）</p>
<p>事主損失港幣九萬大隊趕來歹徒遠颺。又：蘇高院今令所屬限三個月內，將因案覊押之被告一律依法予以處分，如有特殊情形，須專案呈請展現，罪犯如判三年以下徒刑而情節輕微，且尚未確定者，均可聲請停止覊押。</p>

<p>聯合宣言。該項意見頃發表如下：　原子能問題：吾人以爲</p>
<p>科學硏究，應以增進人類福利爲目的，原子能之硏究亦非例</p>
<p>外。原子核可以分裂之發現，適値民主國家與獨裁國家進行</p>
<p>生死舊鬥之時，科學家乃將原子能用之於戰爭武器，原子能</p>
<p>之不幸，亦科學硏究之不幸也。今大戰旣已告終，民主國家</p>
<p>正在努力合作，吾人主張此種硏究，應爲公開的，自由的，</p>
<p>向世界和平及人類福利之前途邁進；不願見此可爲人類造福</p>
<p>之發明作成殘酷之武器，更不願見以原子能武器競賽或保守</p>
<p>原子彈製造秘密之故，而破壞民主國家之團結或危及科學硏</p>
<p>究之自由。爲此，吾人對於愛因斯坦敎授所倡導之原子能敎</p>
<p>育委員會，及美國原子科學家所組織之同盟，願予以支持。</p>
<p>國內科學研究問題：我國人民處原子能時代，仍在飢餓綫</p>
<p>上掙扎，其原因之一，乃由於科學各後。蓋科學發達之意義</p>
<p>，原爲提高人民之生活水準，其提高之程度應與科學發達之</p>
<p>程度成正比例。國人以往，對於基本科學旣未重視，一旦進</p>
<p>入原十能時代，乃追追然欲輸入一二有關原子能硏究之儀器</p>
<p>，與當時科學先進國家並駕齊驅，是誠不可能之事。吾人以</p>
<p>爲欲謀我國科學之發展，宜從根本上着手，如科學敎育之圖</p>
<p>書儀器應予以充實，實行硏究及敎育人才之科學家生活宜予</p>
<p>以保障；尤要者，科學事業宜有確定之經費與長久之計劃，</p>
<p>不可如三峽水利工程之旋辦旋止，庶幾提倡科學不至如囊昔</p>
<p>之船砲政策，徒供世界人士之訕笑，而科學乃可成爲我建國</p>

<h3>考試閑話</h3>
<p>— 闕疑之</p>
<p>編者按：本文作者應編者之請，用考塲的角度看學</p>
<p>府的雜景。這裏，作者提出了問題，指出了月前大學生</p>
<p>就學的困難，寫出了考塲的形形式式。這是大學學府開</p>
<p>學聲中，一篇珍貴的文字。</p>
<p>一年一度的新生入學考試，循例在大熱天的八月裏舉行，學</p>
<p>校要費一筆大錢，考生不遠千里而來，疲於奔命，有人說，這也</p>
<p>是勞民傷財的一椿</p>
<p>爲的要保守考試的機密，試題要關起門來印的，幾位職員和</p>
<p>工友，自開始入「關」之後，起居飲食，都不得越雷池一步，直</p>
<p>到考試完畢，方才放出來。洩漏了試題，是可以判徒刑的。</p>
<p>閱卷是一樁苦差事，太單調</p>
<p>，天天看着相同的卷子，答案對</p>
<p>的少，錯的多，引不起閱卷人的</p>
<p>興趣；考卷那末多，天氣道樣熱</p>
<p>，揮扇拭汗，還來不及，硬要聚</p>
<p>精會神的一本一本有下去，眞有</p>
<p>些呌人着急；看疲了之後，也就</p>
<p>難免眼高手低的畫分數，可是考</p>
<p>生的命運，就決定在此　眞要筆</p>
<p>下留情，體恤考生們的一塲辛苦</p>
<p>，多花點精神和時問，切不要「</p>
<p>以意爲之」，「善觀氣色」。</p>
<p>考生一年比一年多起來，錄</p>
<p>取也愈來愈艱難了。據說今年全</p>
<p>國有高中畢業生二十萬，全國專</p>
<p>科以上的學校約可容納三萬人，</p>
<p>剩下的十七萬人怎麼辦？個個程</p>
<p>度都不够水準嗎？程度不够格，</p>
<p>根本就不能讓他們畢業，旣畢業</p>
<p>，就要設法讓他們升學，高中畢</p>
<p>業雖不是個個都要升學，但大多</p>
<p>數是預備升學，少少的說，十七</p>
<p>萬人中，至少有十萬是要失學了</p>
<p>。這是敎育上一個大問題，同時</p>
<p>也是一個很嚴重的社會問題。當</p>
<p>今黨團方面正在注意「保障靑年</p>
<p>升學就業機會均等」，盼能爲他</p>
<p>們想想切實的辦法。</p>
<p>考生的家庭經濟情形，很是</p>
<p>懸殊，就考塲所見，有西裝華挺</p>
<p>的，也有穿單汗衫的，有穿白皮</p>
<p>鞋的，也有穿草鞋的，有抹脂搽</p>
<p>粉，手帶鑽戒的時髪都市小姐，</p>
<p>也有逢首垢面，穿藍布大褂的鄕</p>
<p>下大姑娘。更有遠道來上海的考</p>
<p>生，無錢住旅記，於考完之後，</p>
<p>留在考塲裏過夜，至於在投考的</p>
<p>學校走廊或敎室裏臨時打地舖的</p>
<p>更多了。這說明了一部分　家庭</p>
<p>經濟不景氣，和農村破產，這些</p>
<p>學生是讀不起大學的。反過來看</p>
<p>，有力量讀書的也不少。我在一</p>
<p>個坐着二百二十人的考塲上，算</p>
<p>了算考生用用型新式派克自來水</p>
<p>筆的有四十八支之多，用國貨自</p>
<p>來水海的不必說了。倘以此推測</p>
<p>考生的家庭經濟狀况，至少可說</p>
<p>有四分之一的人很當，四分之一</p>
<p>的很窮，「保障升學機會均等」</p>
<p>，政府的獎學金應該專門獎勵這</p>
<p>些淸寒優秀有志上進的智識靑年</p>
<p>，不要讓那些公子哥兒，拿了公</p>
<p>費去跳舞和看電影！</p>
<p>充實學力，要在平時。臨渴</p>
<p>掘井，緩不濟急，考生中有一個</p>
<p>普遍的現象，在入考塲之前，幾</p>
<p>乎人人捧着一本「投考指南」，</p>
<p>「升學指導」，「大學試題詳解</p>
<p>」，……這充分表露了平時學習</p>
<p>之不足，只好臨時抱佛脚了。考</p>
<p>塲上舞弊的事也是司空見慣，打</p>
<p>派司，偸看，夾帶，換卷子，掉</p>
<p>座位，和罰名頂替的都有。夾帶</p>
<p>花樣很多，最妙的是有位女學生</p>
<p>把數學公式川墨筆寫在她那雪白</p>
<p>的大腿上，寫在手掌心裏的，不</p>
<p>算稀奇。對照片是防止考生冒替</p>
<p>的有效方法，有些面貌特殊，一</p>
<p>看就是，有些似是而非，難以判</p>
<p>斷，尤其兄弟代考，更難辨認，</p>
<p>個人經騐比較耳形可辨眞僞。</p>
<p>上考塲如同上戰塲，全靠眞</p>
<p>本領，程度好的，到處爭售，不</p>
<p>必託人「先容」，「介紹」，「</p>
<p>提携」，……我敢說現在一般的</p>
<p>大學，招生都是組織委員會辦理</p>
<p>的，事權獨立，連校長也不能干</p>
<p>與。考試手續那末繁，人數那末</p>
<p>多，又是用彌封的，錄取標準，</p>
<p>是開會決定的，誰能通得了「關</p>
<p>節」？所以要想考「關係」，或</p>
<p>做點「底下工作」二錄取，是絕</p>
<p>對不可能的。我常泰勸投考落第</p>
<p>的學生，考試是公平的，不要灰</p>
<p>心，應再接再厲，今年不取，明</p>
<p>年再來，有志竟成竟必可如願以</p>
<p>償的了。</p>
<p>的確，招考新生是學校的一</p>
<p>件大事，同時更是考生生命史上</p>
<p>的一個重大關鍵，考進了火學，</p>
<p>可以深造，前程萬里，朱可限量</p>
<p>；不幸落第，因而改業，不求上</p>
<p>進，終生碌碌，所以這關鍵對於</p>
<p>智識靑年的前途，影響太大了。</p>
<p>我們現行的額少「僧」多的考試</p>
<p>制度，是不是盡善盡美？可不可</p>
<p>以仿照巴黎，倫敦，紐約的大學</p>
<p>，收納幾萬名通學生大大的開放</p>
<p>一下，使有志上進的智識靑年，</p>
<p>人人有書讀？我想這是值得政府</p>
<p>當局和社會人士加以考量的。</p>
<h3>生死之交</h3>
<p>— 曙風</p>
<p>在這「祗重衣衫不車人」的社會中，一</p>
<p>般人唯以利相傾，勢利相交，朋友之間，眞</p>
<p>正能見仁見義，推心置腹的，怕是鳳毛麟角</p>
<p>，絕無僅有的了。在在所見，舞非多的是一</p>
<p>些落井下石，翻目若不相識的一羣所謂「戚</p>
<p>友」也者。至於談到「生死相交」這個「名</p>
<p>辭」時，眞不覺引起無限量的感慨，喟嘆人</p>
<p>心不古，世態炎凉起來了。</p>
<p>傳說春秋時，楚元王慕仁好義，招賢納</p>
<p>士，士人多聞風歸之，有一個名呌左伯桃的</p>
<p>寒士，也携書囊糧食奔向楚國，希望能蒙楚</p>
<p>王重用，一展他的雄圖大略，及</p>
<p>至雍州，結識了羊角哀，就此這</p>
<p>兩介寒儒因爲彼此契合而結爲金</p>
<p>蘭，於是一同往楚走去，路經梁</p>
<p>山，正遇風雪，左伯桃以爲此去</p>
<p>路程迢迢，所帶衣裝糧食有限，</p>
<p>決不能兩全，於是「脫衣共糧」</p>
<p>，自己凍斃在森林裏，却呌羊角</p>
<p>袁帶着自己的衣服糧食，隻身投</p>
<p>楚，後來羊角哀果然被拜爲中大</p>
<p>夫，而且棄請楚王，厚葬了左伯</p>
<p>桃。……但是因爲左伯桃的墳墓</p>
<p>太逼近了荆軻的墓，因此陰靈時</p>
<p>爲荆軻所辱，羊角哀不忍左伯桃</p>
<p>被荆軻所欺，也自刎於左伯桃墓</p>
<p>前，殮葬其側，以死助左拒荆，</p>
<p>從左伯桃於地下。此事雖不免涉</p>
<p>及荒誕，而左伯桃羊角哀二人以</p>
<p>死殉友，却値得稱頌。「生死相</p>
<p>交」這四個字，在左羊二人眞當</p>
<p>之無愧了。</p>
<p>可巧的是在同時（公元前六</p>
<p>百年左右），在希腦史裏也有兩</p>
<p>個「生死相交」的雅典靑年，一</p>
<p>個呌克拉底瑙司（Cratinos），一</p>
<p>個呌阿里斯託德託司（Aristode</p>
<p>mos），其時雅典正在西倫（C</p>
<p>ylon）之亂後，人心浮動，不易</p>
<p>平息.西倫旣掌握了大權，便想</p>
<p>起必須有一個轟轟烈烈的表示來</p>
<p>掩飾他的罪過，好名正言順地與</p>
<p>民更始，改變人民的意向。於是</p>
<p>請得了賢德著名的依庇奈尼特（</p>
<p>Dpinenide）來舉行這種贖罪的</p>
<p>典禮。於是各處的神壇上,又重</p>
<p>新點上了「聖火」，豐盛的祭品</p>
<p>又獻上了祭壇，但是，隆重的儀</p>
<p>式中，還得要一個「人」來作犧</p>
<p>牲。而克拉底瑙司和阿里斯託德</p>
<p>摩司兩人，都極願意犧牲了自己</p>
<p>爲謀得祖國幸福。但是，無論他</p>
<p>們中間的那一個人死了，另外的</p>
<p>一個也決不願意獨存於世，因爲</p>
<p>他們有着深厚的友誼，和有着「</p>
<p>死願同日」的情分，所以，他們</p>
<p>兩人，一起做了犧牲，在這種迷</p>
<p>信的舉動下，爲着他們的祖國，</p>
<p>爲着他們的友誼，流了他們兩個</p>
<p>人的血，塗刷在神壇上。這個故</p>
<p>事，正說明了在和左羊二人同時</p>
<p>代，却並不同地域的一對「生死</p>
<p>相交」的朋友的故事。正所謂是</p>
<p>「無獨有偶了」。</p>
<p>綜觀以上的兩個東西映照的</p>
<p>故事，我們可以看出他們雖然處</p>
<p>於兩種稍有相似的情形下，和兩</p>
<p>個從不相往返的地域中，個他們</p>
<p>各自以身殉友的壯舉，眞可義照</p>
<p>千秋，愧煞一般不義之士了。</p>

<h3>美國派頭素菜生吃</h3>
<p>美國人進膳，一定先來一碟生菜，種類繁多，普通是生</p>
<p>番茄和生白菜，考究些的鷄絲和生白菜，或華錦水菓。何以</p>
<p>美國人吃生菜不生蛔蟲呢，因爲美國農塲不用大糞澆菜，而</p>
<p>用消過毒的自來水，所以生菜不能成爲傳染病的媒介。在美</p>
<p>國吃生菜，決不會吃出草紙來。上海的各西菜館也依樣葫蘆</p>
<p>，十足美化，我在下著之先，一定把生菜翻幾個身，看有無</p>
<p>草紙在內，但躱在纖維裏的傳染病菌却無法把牠捉住，爲了</p>
<p>表示洋化起見，祗得把那不衛生的菜吃下肚去，旣不使主人</p>
<p>失面子，也不被特者當洋盤，但在未座止用大黨作黨榮肥料</p>
<p>之前，于案菜生吃總是不合衛生的，同然　捐是市政當局的</p>
<p>筆大收入，大糞本身的巨額代價也造成了許多糞大王的財富</p>
<p>，但大糞的收入，有一大部分被防疫的支出所抵消了，每年</p>
<p>從生菜上傳播的病菌如果加以統計的話一定有驚人的數字。</p>
<p>當我偶爾亦坐進華懋飯店或惠中飯店的時候，看到鄰座的人</p>
<p>在吃生菜，我便起了一種感覺，好像他運草紙及病菌都狼吞</p>
<p>虎嚥地吃下去了，吃過之後少不得要打防疫針來預防病菌作</p>
<p>祟，事先何以不把生菜燒熟了再吃。美國派頭要具有美國條</p>
<p>件，至少可以說，大糞和大菜是不共戴天的。</p>
<h3>中·印·日摺扇之喩</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>讀了印度大使羅家倫八月十</p>
<p>八日在新德里所發的廣播辭，說</p>
<p>印度不流血革命圓滿成功，宣爲</p>
<p>歷史中的空前成就云云。我因此</p>
<p>想起章氏業書中的幾篇文章，太</p>
<p>炎先生對於印度有深刻的硏究，</p>
<p>他有送印度鉢邏罕保什二君序，</p>
<p>記鉢羅罕君之言曰：「吾聞千年</p>
<p>以往，有印度日本二沙門，同時</p>
<p>至支那，支熱沙門延之入，與語</p>
<p>甚驩，因曰：吾三國其猶摺扇耶</p>
<p>？印度其紙，支那其竹格，日本</p>
<p>其繫柄之　繩也。異日二國中興</p>
<p>，與日本相約結處於亞洲，當如</p>
<p>此摺扇矣。悲夫，今紙與竹格皆</p>
<p>糜爛，獨環繩在耳，其能復摺扇</p>
<p>之舊形歟？不可知也。……」（</p>
<p>此文明治四十年作，又重複見於</p>
<p>記印度西婆耆王紀念會事一文中</p>
<p>，）</p>
<p>現在抗戰勝利的中國，雖然</p>
<p>還在糜爛之中，但總算把環繩撤</p>
<p>掉了，很慶幸地作爲摺扇之紙的</p>
<p>印度，煥然一新，我們這柄不甚</p>
<p>完整的竹格，有急於修理的必要</p>
<p>，假如修理好了，裝上新美的紙</p>
<p>，（意思是說與印度合作）豈不</p>
<p>是足以形成很漂亮的一柄摺扇嗎</p>
<p>？摺壩並不必需要什麽繫柄的環</p>
<p>繩，易以他物，棄之可也，但怕</p>
<p>有人利用那環繩，以束縛這一柄</p>
<p>有紙有竹格的精美之摺扇耳。</p>

<p>不倫不類的「南島相思曲」</p>
<p>這部戲是以</p>
<p>一個三角戀愛的</p>
<p>故事來描寫馬來</p>
<p>亞土女荷花的殉情記，但由於綿劇者的缺</p>
<p>乏創造能力，所以劇本中的故事顯得東拚</p>
<p>西凑，荷花的被綁架失蹤，男主角羅强倫</p>
<p>旣知道是他父親的陰謀，爲何又願意隨他</p>
<p>父親返香港？從這個例子中，是够說明這</p>
<p>位編劇者不顧劇情的發展是否合理，只是</p>
<p>隨心所欲的要完成這部悲劇。結果，除了</p>
<p>像現在這樣不倫不類的悲劇之外，這還能</p>
<p>希能什麽？</p>
<p>演員中，季禾子平平，王豪永遠是那</p>

<p>「朱門怨」企圖表</p>

<p>故事，使觀衆感到厭膩，尤其重要的，作</p>
<p>者並沒有着力的批判這些人物，所以沒落</p>
<p>的原因，使觀衆有了這部片子，結果是一</p>
<p>蕪所得。</p>
<p>演出上也一無可取，導演的低能是失</p>
<p>的是主要原因。同時這些演員除了罷秋</p>
<p>霞尚較爲差强人意之外，其他的沒有一個</p>
<p>是可取的，尤以張瑛的表少爺與巴鴻的三</p>

<p>克拉克蓋博戰</p>
<p>後重返片子，再配上了</p>
<p>葛麗亞嘉蓀的女主角，陣容是堅强的，但</p>
<p>戲却不能使我們滿意。首先這個劇本的內</p>
<p>容，描寫一個水手與一個圖書館女管理員</p>
<p>的戀愛，那是純粹「美國式」的，從相織</p>
<p>到戀愛，不到一天，僅只三天的時間，他</p>
<p>們便結了婚。一個星期後，他們又宣告離</p>
<p>婚了，一切都是形同兒戲，誰能說這不是</p>
<p>胡閙。</p>

<p>平庸的「新紅花豔曲」</p>
<p>「新紅花豔</p>
<p>曲」是以南認人的</p>
<p>哈瓦納　背景，</p>
<p>穿插了一個並不新奇的多角戀愛故事，主</p>
<p>要的原因是要安排號稱「南美人妖」的卡</p>
<p>門密蘭坦的熱帶歌舞，可是這位奇形怪狀</p>
<p>的「人妖」在上海觀衆的觀感中，已經是</p>
<p>不覺得新鮮了。再加上故事本身缺少動人</p>
<p>，南美的風光也未能盡量介紹，所以「新</p>
<p>紅花豔曲」僅是部平庸的歌舞片。</p>
<p>卡門密闌坦總是那一套老花樣，愛麗</p>
<p>絲費與約翰潘恩在這樣的片子裏，自然也</p>
<p>不會有什麼精彩的表演的。</p>
<p>此片彩色尚隹。</p>

<p>們似乎還沒有看</p>

<p>介紹中國抗戰史實的片子，現在正在放映</p>
<p>的「中國之抗戰」是一部較能令人滿意的</p>
<p>紀錄片。</p>
<p>這裏我們得感謝美國導演佛蘭克卡潑</p>
<p>拉優秀的剪輯按巧，雖然有好些地方過多</p>
<p>的運用了重複的鏡頭，那也許由於他對中</p>
<p>國情形的不太熟悉所致，以致把某一事件</p>
<p>的鏡頭分用在幾件不同地域的事件上，在</p>
<p>熟悉的中國人而前，這是無法不被認出來</p>
<p>的。——但我依然推蔫這部値得一看的紀</p>
<p>錄片。</p>
<p>不值一看的「棄婦」</p>
<p>「棄婦」是以</p>
<p>色情的廣告來誘惑</p>
<p>觀衆的，結果觀衆</p>
<p>留失望了。因爲，事實上這部片子是不値</p>
<p>一看的。故事極爲平淡，演出上也是沉悶</p>
<p>不堪，而且片子又短，根本就沒有宣傳上</p>
<p>的那一套什麽「艷」「蕩」之類，這些都</p>
<p>是哄　觀衆的噱頭。至於正開片加映勞萊</p>
<p>哈台的「悍婦呆夫」，那是一張陳舊的滑</p>

<h3>Major Cases Passed by the State Council: General Election Voting Postponed by One Month; All Parties to Participate in Local Public Opinion Organizations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peking, 26th Dispatch] The voting date for the National Assembly representative election has been decided to be postponed by one month. This case was submitted by the Election Headquarters to the National Government and was passed by the State Council on the morning of the 26th. According to the original schedule, the National Assembly voting period was set for October 21st to 23rd. However, due to some difficulties in the election progress (such as the obstruction of elections in the pacification zones and the unresolved issue of party nominations), the voting period has been postponed to November 21st to 23rd. It is reported that the election issues in the pacification zones were also discussed at the meeting. How to conduct elections in the areas recovered from the bandits by Zhu has not yet been decided, but the election affairs in the recovered areas will proceed as usual.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] After participating in the central government, the People's Party and the Youth Party are now requesting to participate in local public opinion organizations. This matter was proposed at the State Council meeting on the 26th by the government commissioners Xu Fulin, Ji Yiqiao, Hu Haimen, Yu Jiaju, and Zeng Qi. The proposal was to amend the regulations of the provincial, municipal, and county councils, and to select people from various parties to participate. The proposal has been passed by the State Council and sent to the Legislative Yuan for handling in accordance with the principles. The original proposal stated: Article 12 of the policy guidelines states that "the participation in the conferences or provisional conferences of various provinces, cities, and counties should be as far as possible by various parties and non-party people." Also, the election date for the supervisors is very near, and the election law stipulates that candidates for supervisors must have nominations from at least five councilors. Now, although various parties participate in the government, because the councils of various provinces, cities, and counties have already been established, no one from any party has yet participated in the councils of various provinces, cities, and counties in accordance with the agreement of Article 12 of the policy guidelines. As a result, various parties have no legal basis to nominate candidates for supervisors in the election of supervisors, and the terms of the councils have been announced to be extended. In the current stage, there is still no possibility of re-election. The participation of people from various parties in the councils of provinces, cities, and counties cannot be carried out for the time being, which seems to be inconsistent with Article 12 of the policy guidelines, and the election of supervisors cannot be carried out. It is proposed that, in accordance with the principles of Article 12 of the policy guidelines, the Legislative Yuan should amend the regulations of the councils and provisional councils of various provinces, cities, and counties, and use the method of selection to select people from various parties to jointly participate in the councils or provisional councils of various provinces, cities, and counties. As for the number of people, it is proposed to be: 15 to 20 people for provinces or municipalities directly under the central government, and 5 to 10 people for counties or municipalities under the jurisdiction of provinces.</p>

<p>1.  The Central Trust Bureau's pilot construction loan was inquired about in June of last year. The highest authority instructed the Central Trust Bureau to pay attention to and assist in the housing problem of public educators in the capital and other important cities, and to plan and promote the business of urban real estate management. The bureau drafted construction loan plans and measures for Peking and Shanghai, but it did not immediately implement them due to many practical difficulties. In April of this year, the bureau submitted revised measures, which were approved by Chen Feng and piloted in Nanjing. The loan amount was temporarily set at 5 billion yuan, and detailed measures were formulated. The main points are: Applicants must be public educators with their own base, and they must mortgage their base and the planned building. The total loan amount shall not exceed 50% of the mortgage value, and the maximum amount per household shall not exceed 200 million yuan. Repayments will begin in the fourth month after the loan is granted, and must be paid off in the sixth month. If the debt cannot be paid off on time, the mortgage shall be disposed of. A reliable guarantee must be provided. The above loan began to be handled in May of this year. The bureau reviewed and approved 35 households in succession according to the order, and the approved loan amount was a total of 5.12 billion yuan. The loan of 3.353 billion yuan has been paid. The detailed list has been published in the newspaper on the 14th.</p>
<p>2.  The Capital Zhongshan North Road Construction Loan: This loan is aimed at prospering the construction of houses on both sides of the vacant land on Zhongshan North Road. It was handled in accordance with the Chairman's telegram. The original approval was 20 billion yuan, and detailed loan measures were formulated and published in the newspaper. The main points are: The applicant's own base must be located on both sides of the road along Zhongshan North Road. The applicant is limited to individuals. Institutions, banks, companies, and firms are not allowed to apply. The loan per household can only be 50% of the total construction price, and the maximum shall not exceed 200 million yuan. The applicant must provide a land certificate from the Land Bureau and a construction permit from the Public Works Bureau. Repayments will begin in the seventh month and must be paid off within one year. In order to handle the matter properly, the Loan Syndicate was organized by this office to handle it. The managers of the Nanjing branches of the national banks and bureaus were appointed, and the directors of the Land Bureau and the Public Works Bureau of the municipal government were invited to jointly participate in the organization. All applications were reviewed one by one and forwarded to the Central Trust Bureau for lending. This loan began to be handled on May 17 and ended on July 2. A total of 28 households were approved for loans, with a loan amount of 3.997 billion yuan. The list of borrowers and the loan amount are listed as follows: Zhu Xian (Ministry of Education) 197.5 million yuan, Chen Youbing (businessman) 26 million yuan, Chen Youxin (contractor) 100 million yuan, Gong Yu (Sixth Office of the Ministry of National Defense) 77.5 million yuan, Liu Jicheng (doctor) 180 million yuan, Ha Xiongwen (Ministry of the Interior) 200 million yuan, Liu Rongbian, etc. (flour merchants) 60 million yuan, Li Jia (school) 150 million yuan, Chen Jiadong, Zheng Yuanxing (businessman) 100 million yuan, Zhang Fengwu (businessman) 150 million yuan, Zheng Zizheng (engineer) 170 million yuan, Zhou Huaxin (Ministry of Finance) 200 million yuan, Wu Songlin, etc. (watch industry) 60 million yuan, Hu Qingrong (grain merchant) 120 million yuan, Huang Cilun (local merchant) 200 million yuan, Zhao Wangzhi (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) 100 million yuan, Xu Baochu (Lequn Middle School) 200 million yuan, Jiang Jifan 31 million yuan, Sun Fushou (businessman) 95 million yuan, Jiang Shihua 100 million yuan, Zhou Yuncheng (China Real Estate Company) 200 million yuan, Luo Mingkun (film industry) 200 million yuan, Wang Anxiu (academic circles) 200 million yuan, Zhang (academic circles) 200 million yuan, Xu Zhizhong (businessman) 120 million yuan, Gao Hua (businessman) 200 million yuan, Ge Sukan 160 million yuan, Gu Shuwei (businessman) 200 million yuan.

<p>The purpose of all the above loans is to solve the housing shortage problem in the capital city, and special attention and assistance are given to public educators, but all loans must fully meet the loan conditions before they can be applied for. As for the payment of each loan, it is collected by the borrower together with the construction manufacturer according to the progress of the remittance, so as not to be diverted to other uses. In short, the Loan Syndicate and the Central Trust Bureau are all handling the matter in accordance with the approved measures, and if there is any situation where the repayment cannot be made on time, the pledged property will be disposed of in accordance with the agreement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Central Trust Bureau recently issued a statement on the housing construction loan situation in Nanjing, and the content is the same as before.</p>
<h3>The Office Location of Chairman Chiang in Chongqing is Donated to the Church to Establish an Elementary School for Orphans; It is Not Private Property of the Chairman and His Wife</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] It has been found that the New York telegram issued by this agency the day before yesterday stated that Chairman Chiang and his wife would donate 100 acres of land and 20 stone buildings near "Huangshan" in Chongqing as a school and home for wartime orphans, and entrust it to Bishop Chen Wenyuan for management. It is now learned that the houses and land there are not privately owned by the Chairman and his wife, but the office location of the former Chairman of the Military Committee, covering more than 200 acres of mountainous land and a total of 10 buildings of various sizes, all of which were temporary buildings during the war. After the victory, the government returned to the capital. The Chairman, in view of the enthusiasm of the church in serving during the war and the disaster suffered by the citizens of Chongqing during the war against the Japanese aggression, which caused countless orphans, and the Military Committee had ended, suggested that the government donate the land to the National Christian Council of China and entrust it to establish a church and manage the elementary school for orphans as a foundation. As for the report on the 2nd by the United Press that the Chairman and his wife donated more than 10,000 acres of private property and 50,000 US dollars, it is an obvious misrepresentation of the facts.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Personnel Should Recognize the Past Party Affairs Qualifications of People from Political Parties; It Was Approved in Principle After Discussion by the State Council</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Six government commissioners from the People's Party and the Youth Party, including Xu Chuanlin, believe that after participating in the government, their past experience in party affairs work should be recognized by the Ministry of Personnel as the years of service for grading purposes. On the 26th, Zeng Qi, He Luzhi, Yu Jiaju, Xu Chuanlin, Hu Haimen, and Ji Yiqiao jointly submitted a proposal to the State Council: "Please instruct the Examination Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Personnel that all political parties participating in government work, the party affairs work experience of their staff at all levels should be recognized as the years of service for appointment and grading, provided that the nature of the party affairs work is comparable to the position to be appointed." The proposal was approved in principle. The proposal stated: "The knowledge and skills required by party affairs workers and the nature of their work are no different from those of general administrative personnel. It is easy to achieve mastery through proficiency by applying this experience to administrative work. However, in the past, this experience was generally limited to the Kuomintang. Now that all parties are participating in government work, the party affairs work experience of other political parties participating in the government should be recognized uniformly, and there is no reason for the same experience to be treated differently. It is feared that the staff handling the matter may not understand this intention, or may use the excuse that there is no basis for it without clear instructions. It is proposed that the National Government instruct the Examination Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Personnel, and instruct other Yuans to instruct their subordinates to inform them of the matter."</p>
<h3>Strik Advocates Abandoning Japanese Reparations; All Parties in Our Country Are Extremely Dissatisfied; Our "Reparations and Restitution Committee" is Established in Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The issue of Japanese reparations has been pending for a long time, and has long been suspected by the people of the country. Since the United States recently published Strik's recommendations, it has increasingly aroused dissatisfaction among all parties in our country. According to relevant sources, Strik, chairman of the seven-member American committee who went to Japan twice this year to assist the Allied Headquarters in handling Japanese reparations, recently published an article entitled "Retaliation is Waste" in "American Magazine." On the issue of Japanese reparations, he advocated that the United States should abandon the Pauley Plan and overturn the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission on reparations. This argument seems to be mutually confirmed with the current delaying attitude of the Allied Headquarters towards reparations and its strategy of appeasing and supporting Japan, and it has many adverse effects on the Allied countries' demands for reparations from Japan. Therefore, the main points of the article will be recorded below to arouse the attention and vigilance of the people of the country. Strik first quoted the experience of reparations from Germany, saying that the United States allowed the Soviet Union to dismantle industrial equipment and ships, while at the same time allocating funds to help the German post-war economy. This phenomenon is very contradictory, so he advocated that the issue of reparations from Japan should be handled with caution to avoid repeating the same mistakes. He also said that the United States does not need German and Japanese factories, but should encourage these two countries to be self-sufficient and produce items other than those they need. In this way, the United States can not only avoid providing relief, but also enable American factories and farmers to gain markets. Strik also stated: "The Pauley Plan is destroying the Japanese economy, thereby increasing the burden of American relief," and implied that MacArthur was dissatisfied with the decisions made by the Far Eastern Commission based on the Pauley Plan, hoping to change them, so he allowed 700 of the 1,100 factories that had been designated for dismantling to be temporarily put into operation. Strik continued to state his findings, saying: "Even if all the current equipment remains in Japan, it will be difficult for Japan to engage in war again. The policy of the Far Eastern Commission, which demands huge reparations, will inevitably lead to the collapse of the Japanese economy and continuous economic needs in the future." Therefore, his conclusion is: "The decisions of the Far Eastern Commission should be overturned, and Japan should be placed on a stable economic foundation in the peace treaty to enhance its production capacity."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th Dispatch] The "Chinese Reparations and Restitution Committee" established by our delegation to Japan was officially established on the 21st, and is fully responsible for reparations and the return of looted property. The number of members of the committee may be increased to 20 to 25, and 15 to 20 technical assistants will be hired. Wu Bannong, the leader of the economic and scientific group of the delegation, also serves as the chairman of the committee. Wang Shugao, Li Chen, Zhou Maobai, and Chong Kong are the four members.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The External Affairs Committee for the Review of the Japanese Peace Treaty held another meeting on the morning of the 26th. Chairman Ye Gongchao attended, and the attendees were still representatives from relevant ministries and commissions. Personnel from the army and navy expressed their opinions. Wang Chonghui, the guiding committee member of the committee, told reporters that he would return to Shanghai on the 27th and immediately begin drafting his personal opinions, which would be submitted to the External Affairs Committee next week.

<h3>The Far Eastern Economic Commission Plans to Establish in Hangzhou; I Am Preparing to Participate in the International Trade Conference</h3>

<h3>Authorities are Considering Methods for Issuing Foreign Exchange Certificates for Self-Provided Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 26th Dispatch] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Import and Export Trade Association, and 14 other groups, in order to request the issuance of licenses for self-provided foreign exchange registered goods, specially sent representatives Shou Jingwei and 15 others to Beijing by car on the 6th. The matter is currently under consideration and a solution will be reached in the near future, reportedly no more than ten days. Shou and others attended meetings with the Participating Council, the Entire Economic Council, and the Ministry of Finance, with similar results from their petitions. Shou and his party will return to Shanghai by night train on the 26th. According to Mr. Shou, the announcement issued by the Committee for the Management of Arrivals and Departures on August 21st stated: "For goods already shipped or arrived in port before August 16th, permission will be granted for registration. For goods shipped after the 16th, foreign exchange will be purchased at the official rate or forcibly shipped out of port, and the merchant's license will be revoked." However, when merchants learned of this announcement, even if they urgently telegraphed foreign countries to stop shipments, it was too late. Goods already loaded onto ships between the 16th and 21st could not be processed, and foreign manufacturers are not located at seaports. If goods have already been transported from the factory to the port, even if the ships have not yet departed but berths have been reserved and other preparations have been completed, it is impossible to stop loading. Therefore, two requests are specifically made: For self-provided foreign exchange materials that have been registered and comply with current trade control regulations, and that fall under the categories of permitted imports, please promptly reissue licenses so that they can be declared and imported as soon as possible; for items that are prohibited from import, imports should be prohibited. Extend the date for loading goods that have already been ordered until the end of September, allowing manufacturers and importers to provide documentation for supplementary registration and release. A large portion of the goods that have arrived in Shanghai with self-provided foreign exchange but without licenses are machinery, steel, hardware, pigments, paper, rubber, and chemical raw materials, among which some are production equipment or industrial raw materials, and daily necessities for Shanghai. The sources of these goods are roughly as follows: Orders placed before the promulgation of the trade control regulations on November 17th of last year; the abolition of the regulation by the Management Committee that each importer could obtain $2,000 per week; the temporary opening of self-provided foreign exchange in April; the government not strictly requiring importers to obtain licenses before ordering from foreign countries before the announcement of the new trade regulations on August 21st. Through this repeated accumulation, the total value has reached as much as 70 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Meets with Truman, Submits Investigation Report and Recommendations on China and Korea, Marshall Sends Special Letter to Stuart, Hoping to Strengthen Sino-American Trade</h3>

Wedemeyer met with the President for half an hour. Afterwards, he declined to comment on his report or on what he discussed with the President.

When asked if the recommendations he made were based on his statement before leaving China, he replied: "The report I submitted today has nothing to do with my departure with my entourage."</p>

According to reliable sources, after the Wedemeyer Mission left Nanjing, General Marshall sent a special letter asking him to continue his outstanding work and strengthen Sino-American understanding and friendship. The Ambassador is currently awaiting the reaction from Washington regarding the Wedemeyer Mission's work report. Before that, he will not make any statements or take any actions that could affect fundamental policies.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses in Nanjing the Standoff Between the United States and the Soviet Union, Which May Continue for Thirty to Fifty Years</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 26th Dispatch] Diplomatic authority Wang Chonghui discussed the global situation with our reporter on the 26th, concluding that the current standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union may continue for thirty to fifty years. However, "experience is the best teacher." Some issues that cannot be resolved through reasoning may be resolved through experiencing some difficulties. Our diplomacy does not involve being pro-American or pro-Soviet, nor do we wish to profit from it. We will address matters on a case-by-case basis, and China will be on the side of justice. We may offend the United States on this matter and offend the Soviet Union on another, but this is by no means being pro-American or pro-Soviet. We choose public reason and justice, and it is possible that we will offend both the United States and the Soviet Union. He believes that the statements and measures taken by Foreign Minister Wang before and after his trip abroad are all manifestations of independent diplomacy, and are more proactive and progressive. Regarding the United Nations General Assembly, he predicted that unless a miracle occurs, only minor issues will be agreed upon. As for major disputes, because they involve ideologies and beliefs, it may be difficult to find solutions. Wang said regarding the overall situation in recent years that during the war, the United Nations had a common enemy of fear, and the United Kingdom and the United States showed more willingness to compromise, so they could cooperate and win the victory together. After the war, the common goal of fear disappeared, and the United Kingdom and the United States were unwilling to continue to make too many concessions. The Soviet Union placed particular emphasis on security, coupled with ideological gaps, resulting in a major standoff that is now difficult to resolve. However, he believes that this overall situation is only a stalemate. The world's anti-war sentiment can eliminate the cruel intention of engaging in war. The current situation of the United Nations General Assembly appears to be lacking in harmony, but frankly stating everyone's true feelings is actually a commendable phenomenon. This is an important point where the United Nations organization is superior to the League of Nations. The League of Nations appeared harmonious on the surface, but in reality, power and deception were the main causes of its failure. Although the United Nations organization may not have great achievements in a short period of time, it has already sown good seeds. In the future, when the two sides in the stalemate learn from experience and discover the principle that "some partial solutions are better than no solutions," it will be the beginning of the resolution of the stalemate.</p>

<h3>War Situation in Jinxi Tending Towards Stability, Beining Railway Inside the Pass Repeatedly Damaged</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Office, 26th Dispatch] There may be noteworthy battles in the Jilin-Changchun area within the week.

It is generally believed that the victory will be a prelude, and a large annihilation battle will occur east of Sipingjie.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 26th Dispatch] The war situation in Jinxi is gradually stabilizing. Although the Communist bandits have gradually increased the number of their units from the 13th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Brigades, and the 12th Brigade has also been discovered, the actions of the bandits are encountering difficulties due to the arrival of the elite troops of the National Army and the deployment of the air force.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Office, 26th Dispatch] In order to cover the three independent brigades, the 10th, 11th, and 13th, of the Communist bandits in eastern Hebei as they cross the pass to participate in the fighting in the Suizhong area, the Communist bandits, in coordination with local armed forces, are actively destroying the Beining Railway inside the pass and attacking National Army strongholds in the Hangu area. At the same time, they are secretly using civilian labor to actively build four highways inside and outside the pass (from Qian'an to Pingquan, from Zunhua to Fushun, from Lengkou to Lingyuan, and from Jiekou to Suizhong). It is reported that the Communist bandits' Independent 10th Brigade has also been discovered in the Jinxi area.

<p>[Our Baoding Office, 26th Dispatch] The situation in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is becoming tense. The 2nd and 4th Columns of the Communist bandits' Rong Zizhen unit, and more than 20,000 people from the "Bohai Military Region" and the "Jizhong Military Region," have been moving east towards the coast for days. The main force of the Communist bandits on both sides of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is advancing north in a roundabout way from Wen'an, Renqiu, and Liucheng. Local Communist bandit units are concentrating on the west side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The township administrations between Jinghai and Dacheng are under siege. The Communist bandits have attacked Wujiakou, west of Jinghai, several times, and the fighting is extremely fierce. The National Army unit in the Xiongxian area in the Pingjin-Baoding triangle has already opened up and is intercepting them.

<h3>Former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e Accused of Receiving and Embezzling</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 26th Dispatch] Former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e has recently been accused of embezzlement by the Tianjin Local Autonomy Promotion Association to the Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group. According to the association's petition: During the early days of the recovery, Zhang closed the front doors of the large warehouses in Tianjin and sold goods through the back doors day and night. It is estimated that the warehouses contained enough food to supply the citizens of Tianjin for three years, and half of the warehouses were emptied after the theft. It is heard that the authorities ordered Li Zongren to investigate this matter, but there have been no results to date. In addition, the Japanese technicians retained by Zhang were all wealthy merchants and not genuine technicians. The situation can be imagined. It is imperative that a thorough investigation be carried out to meet the expectations of the public.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Striving for Effective Governance, Northeastern China Taking on a New Look, People's Hearts Becoming Clear and Bright</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th Dispatch] Since Chen Cheng took office as the Director of the Northeast Administrative Region, he has adhered to the spirit of "striving for the fundamentals" and has quickly rectified various imperfect laws and unreasonable phenomena with great courage and decisiveness. In the past two weeks, he has brought the chaotic situation of the past back on track, and the depressed and sullen situation in Northeast China, and the dismay of the people of the Northeast, have suddenly become clear and bright. According to the facts, this reporter will describe Chen's achievements in Northeast China as follows:</p>
<p>Rectifying Military Discipline</p>
<p>Chen has accepted the demands of the people and has first rectified military discipline. He has strictly prohibited soldiers from forcibly occupying public and private houses, infringing on the people, engaging in commercial profiteering, corruption, and embezzlement, detaining vehicles, recruiting soldiers by false pretenses, and running newspapers, dance halls, and cinemas without following proper procedures. He has worked hard to correct these behaviors. He has severely punished corrupt officials and has encouraged people to report or secretly report corruption cases. He has prohibited civil servants from engaging in commercial activities, regardless of their background, and will severely punish those who violate this.</p>
<p>Streamlining and Merging Agencies</p>
<p>Since the recovery, the administrative institutions in Northeast China have been complex and chaotic, and have been criticized by some people in the central government and local areas. Upon taking office, Chen immediately adopted the opinions of various parties and merged unnecessary agencies. For example, he ordered the merger of the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise Assets Unified Reception Committee, the Northeast Production Administration, and the Northeast Real Estate Administration into the Northeast District Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau. The enemy and puppet enterprise assets received by the various agencies will be classified according to their nature, and will either be transferred to the central government, assigned to local agencies for management, returned to the people, or sold to private enterprises. The bureau will have two offices for secretary and accounting, and two committees for deliberation and valuation. The bureau will be established in early October.</p>
<p>Making the Best Use of Talent</p>
<p>The Northeast Administrative Region originally had political and economic committees. In order to increase administrative efficiency, the central government has decided to merge the above two committees into a political affairs committee. The provincial and municipal governments that have not yet been recovered will also be reduced in size, and will be ordered to move closer to the local areas of the provinces and regions in order to prepare for recovery. The remaining personnel will be reorganized into a political work team and will be trained and sent to various places to work, so that talents can be put to the best use. Therefore, the significance of Chen's simplification policy lies not in simplifying administrative institutions, but in increasing political efficiency. The purpose of his downsizing is not to lay off employees, but to mobilize them.</p>
<p>In the past two years, enemy and puppet properties have been occupied by few people. Recently, some people have secretly sublet the government properties they have occupied in order to profit from them. Chen has ordered that these activities be investigated and banned. The subletters will have their sublet fees confiscated, and the sublessees will be punished double the amount. The properties will be used for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Strictly Preventing Capital Flight</p>
<p>Recently, due to the changing situation in Northeast China, it is difficult to survive without illegal profits, resulting in a large number of officials and merchants carrying funds and attempting to escape into the pass. Since Chen took office, the outflow of Northeast circulation notes into the country was more than 1.5 billion yuan, and in the past few days alone, the outflow of circulation notes into the pass has reached as much as 600 million yuan. Among them, there are inevitably corrupt gains and illegal profits, which are all the blood and sweat of the people of Northeast China. Chen immediately convened the heads of relevant agencies, ordering them to conduct a thorough investigation. If the above-mentioned illegal funds are found to be fleeing, they will be confiscated and used for disaster relief. He also agreed on measures to strengthen auditing and reasonably restrict the outflow of capital.</p>
<p>Leading by Example</p>
<p>Chen personally leads by example, rectifies officials, and strives to eliminate the decadent atmosphere. He lives and eats within the office to facilitate work and avoid wasting time and resources. He has no private affairs. All officials must arrive and leave on time. All department heads and above will hold joint office hours. All important matters will be dealt with immediately without delay. He also promotes frugality, does not host lavish banquets, does not give gifts, and does not offer cigarettes to guests. The monthly savings will be used to subsidize the food expenses of the soldiers. He also prohibits civil servants from engaging in gambling and dancing and other improper entertainment activities.</p>
<p>Chen places great emphasis on the morality and talent of people, regardless of their seniority or connections, and does not place undue emphasis on qualifications. If they are capable and principled and have real talent and ability, they will be promoted without regard to seniority. Therefore, the officials are deeply grateful and work hard in the public interest.</p>
<h3>Rice and Wheat Prices Soar in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Office, 26th Dispatch] Due to low arrivals and sales, and the implementation of currency reform, rice and wheat markets are experiencing tight credit, even during the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, people's hearts are unsettled. Today, rice prices have soared by four to five ten thousand yuan, and wheat prices have also risen by more than two ten thousand yuan due to large purchases. Flour prices are expected to rise. The opening prices are as follows: broken white rice, 555,000 yuan; new japonica rice, 516,500 yuan; port wheat, 472,500 yuan; old white yuan rice, 462,500 yuan; new japonica paddy, 209,000 yuan; old japonica paddy, 228,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province to Start Collecting Land Tax, He Yushu Hosts Press Conference, Provincial Government Decides on Additional Levies for Various Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 26th Dispatch] He Yushu, Director of the Land Tax Department of Jiangsu Province, announced that Jiangsu Province has decided to start collecting land tax on October 1st. He held a press conference on the 26th, where he emphasized two points: 1. Eliminating malpractices and making things convenient for the people, and resolving to investigate all reports and handle them once they are verified. 2. Strengthening supervision work and promoting the collective tax payment movement. The department has also scheduled a province-wide tax collection propaganda week to begin on the 28th. In order to prevent apportionment by various counties and alleviate the financial difficulties of the counties, the provincial government has decided to add the following levies for the land tax collection in various counties: Jiangdu, one dou; Jurong, four sheng; Yangzhong, one dou and seven sheng; Jinshan, five sheng; Shanghai, nine sheng; Nanhui, eight sheng and four ge; Kunshan, five sheng; Danyang, six sheng; Chongming, eight sheng.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Implementation Issues After the Textile Conference</h3>
<p>The Second National Textile Industry Federation Conference just concluded on the 22nd of this month, and the National Textile Industry Production Conference, convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, opened on the 25th, lasting for three days and scheduled to end today. This shows the importance of the textile industry and the importance that the country attaches to it.</p>
<p>The Textile Industry Federation Conference had 72 proposals, and the Production Conference had 101 proposals. All issues, from raw materials, machinery, technology, sales, and how to improve production efficiency, reduce manufacturing costs, and standardize quality standards, have been thoroughly discussed, discussed, and resolved. If we can move from sitting down and talking to standing up and acting, and acting with results, then in the near future, the so-called production of ten million spindles, 320,000 looms, and 25 million dan of cotton will not be difficult to achieve step by step, day by day, and achieve the results we expect. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "It is not difficult to know, but it is difficult to act." Since the government and the business community have identified the goal and are working together to advance towards the overall goal, then no matter how many difficulties are encountered during the implementation period, it will not be difficult to overcome the difficulties and complete this major mission.</p>
<p>We have the three major superior conditions of timing, geography, and human resources for the textile industry.</p>
<p>The current difficulties in increasing production are due to more than one reason, but the most important is the failure to coordinate. For example, textile factories are limited by power and lack accessories; the wool textile industry lacks raw materials, and domestic wool is difficult to transport; machinery manufacturing plants are strangled by funds and cannot expand; import quotas are limited by foreign exchange reserves and are not easy to increase; and high interest rates and high wages are a burden, and sales restrictions are not entirely reasonable. These are all major obstacles at present, and they are also the most thorny problems for both the government and the business community.</p>
<p>However, although there are many difficulties, they are not insurmountable. As long as we identify the key points and work together under the major premise, we can weigh the urgency and priorities and resolve them completely or partially. What is regrettable is that some parties urgently need to take action, while others may still be indifferent. In addition, opinions are divided and there are too many constraints. A few people are even eager for short-term gains and have ulterior motives, so the calculations are too tight and too many side effects occur. This inevitably leads to being overwhelmed and weakens the overall strength and disrupts the established plans.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the various plans have been carefully discussed and resolved at the two conferences, our greatest requirement is whether everyone fully understands the goals and whether the people in charge are impartial and can maintain their grip. If it is determined that this production is indeed the most important industry at present, and that the current industrial plan should focus on the textile industry, then with sincerity, gold and stone can be opened. We believe that there are no insurmountable difficulties.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Electricity Restrictions and Dance Ban</h3>
<p>Shanghai City. The fourth municipal assembly has now entered the stage of current affairs discussions, and its topics are gradually attracting attention. Yesterday's assembly passed measures and resolutions, all after heated debate, and ultimately gained majority support. This is clear evidence of how municipal affairs are being handled and a new sign of China's democratic politics gradually becoming sound.</p>
<p>Electricity supply in this city has been unable to meet demand since the war, greatly impacting industrial production, especially from 6 PM to 10 PM daily. If this situation continues without change, allowing general users to waste electricity, the result will either force factories to operate for only eighteen days a month or compel the power company to adopt a zoned rotating power outage system to cope. The former will undoubtedly further hinder production, while the latter will subject citizens to widespread "darkness" and could lead to adverse consequences that disrupt public order. After serious debate, the councilors amended and passed the mayor's proposed measures for conserving electricity, which is a responsible and wise move. In addition to setting a standard of forty kilowatt-hours per month for ordinary users, with limits based on the highest electricity consumption in March, April, and May of this year, there are separate provisions for commercial, industrial, and institutional users such as schools and hospitals, which are generally feasible. Councilors particularly emphasized that charging all government agencies for electricity usage is welcome news to the public. We sincerely hope that everyone will share the burden of these difficult times, pay attention to increasing production, and conscientiously and voluntarily conserve electricity, so that the saved electricity can be used to power machines for the production of materials. Only with sincere cooperation between citizens and the government can policies achieve their full effect, and the City Council has fulfilled its role as a bridge.</p>
<p>As for banning dancing, although the Executive Yuan has issued a directive, there is still no law in China prohibiting dancing as of the present moment, so commercial dancing cannot be regarded as illegal, and banning it lacks a legal basis. If the ban is for the sake of conservation, then what is the difference between social dancing and commercial dancing? What should be conserved are the foreign drinks and other things that accompany dancing, which are not related to dancing itself. Moreover, this city is an international metropolis, and dance halls hold government licenses, supporting tens of thousands of people, directly and indirectly. The current situation is volatile, with refugees filling the streets and the unemployed still struggling to find placement. Dancers and others may not be able to switch careers immediately. Why create more unemployment at this time? The municipal government must implement central government directives, but the central government has repeatedly urged the closure of dance halls by the end of this month, which seems difficult. However, we know that the central government is striving to streamline administration, and matters that should be legislated or executed by the central government are clearly listed in law. This type of issue does not fall within the rigid administrative scope of the central government and should allow local governments to weigh the situation and adapt to local conditions. Furthermore, the municipality is a unit of local autonomy, and after the Shanghai City Council met, it also requested the central government to reconsider and asked the municipal government to suspend the ban. The popular sentiment is evident. For the sake of the entire municipality, the government should administer with benevolence, focusing on the greater issues. Perhaps it is appropriate to relax the dance ban and withdraw the order. There are many more important matters for the central government to handle at this time, and countless other things in society are more wasteful than dance halls. The Executive Yuan has major issues to address and should not cling to preconceived notions!</p>
<h3>State-Owned Enterprise Sales: Valuation Standards Determined; Methods Include Public Bidding and Share Offering</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises, under the National Economic Council, held its second meeting on the 26th. The meeting was chaired by [blank], with committee members Liu Gongyun, Wu Rencang, Xie Chengping, Li Zhong [blank], Zhang Zizhu, and over ten others in attendance. The following important matters were discussed: Valuation standards: The unit price in 1937 will be used as the valuation standard for each entity.

All valuations will be submitted to the Supervisory Committee for review within two weeks. Methods of sale: divided into public bidding and share offering. It was decided that China Textile, China [Blank], and China [Blank] will be sold through share offerings (selling government-owned shares of China Textile). China Fisheries Corporation, Tianjin [Blank] Paper Company, Central Automobile Parts Manufacturing Plant, and China Tobacco Company will be sold through public bidding. De Foe Trading Company and Bayer [Blank] are [Blank] businesses and will also be sold through bidding in the same manner as state-owned enterprises.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Authorities Commission Commercial Banks to Handle Remittances Between Taiwan and Shanghai; Exchange Rates and Fees to Be Announced Daily</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th] Three days after the Taiwan Provincial Government issued an order to crack down on the black market for exchanging Taiwan currency for legal tender, the black market stopped trading, but the Taiwan currency depreciated further. The unofficial rate was only 49 legal tender dollars for one Taiwan dollar. The Taiwan Provincial Government convened another meeting this afternoon and decided on a new measure: Starting tomorrow, the Bank of Taiwan will commission three commercial banks here—Industrial and Commercial Bank, Chang Hwa Bank, and [Blank] Bank—to publicly handle commercial remittances between Taiwan and Shanghai, without any limit on the amount. The exchange rate will still be based on the official rate of one to seventy-two. However, remittance fees and handling fees will be charged. The amount of these fees will be announced daily by the three banks. Tomorrow's remittance fee and handling fee will be set at 25 percent, meaning that 1.25 Taiwan dollars will be exchanged for 72 legal tender dollars, or one Taiwan dollar will effectively exchange for 57.6 legal tender dollars. According to the Bank of Taiwan, this measure will provide an outlet for commercial remittances, reduce the black market for Taiwan currency, and gradually increase the value of Taiwan currency to the prescribed rate of one to seventy-two. In addition, this reporter has learned that the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Taiwan will also publicly handle remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan at a rate of 60 legal tender dollars for one Taiwan dollar.</p>

<h3>Britain Formally Announces to the United Nations Its Decision to Withdraw from Palestine; Indicates Intention to Abandon Mandate; Arab League Nations Firmly Oppose Partition Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 26th (Broadcast): The 55-nation UN Special Committee on Palestine met at 15:30 standard time today (00:30 AM on the 27th Shanghai time). The British representative, Colonial Secretary Jones, declared that Britain had decided to withdraw completely from Palestine, regardless of the consequences. He continued, stating that Britain advocated immediately ending the old League of Nations mandate granting Britain authority over Palestine for 25 years. He also stated that the future of Palestine was now in the hands of the United Nations, and in the absence of a suitable solution, Britain had decided to withdraw its troops and administrative organs from Palestine as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 26th (Broadcast): British Colonial Secretary Jones, on behalf of the British Imperial Government, expressed gratitude to the UN committee for its long journey and difficult investigative work. He said that the committee had made twelve general recommendations, eleven of which were unanimously approved by the committee, and one of which was approved by a majority. Britain agreed to all twelve recommendations, and the first recommendation was that the mandate over Palestine should be terminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] Observers here generally believe that the British and American delegations attending the UN are not yet willing to immediately announce their final policies on the Palestine issue. The reason why the US policy has not been decided is that the Jews have great power in New York State, and in next year's presidential election, the Jewish vote will have a significant impact on whether Truman or New York Governor Dewey wins. Now Dewey and another Republican candidate, Taft, have expressed support for the majority recommendations of the Palestine Inquiry Committee, namely the partition plan, which is what the Zionist movement supports. Truman, considering his own position, has to proceed cautiously.</p>
<p>Representatives of various countries also pointed out that if the UN passes the partition plan, there are still two issues to be resolved: (1) Who will be responsible for the administration of Palestine during the transitional period of establishing the two countries? (2) Which countries will provide the troops needed to implement the UN resolution? Since the United Nations Military Force has not yet been established, the troops will have to be provided individually by member states. The United States refused to accept the mandate over Palestine after World War I and is unwilling to send troops to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] Syria has notified Britain that the Arab League nations do not recognize the Palestine partition plan. The prime ministers of these countries held a meeting last week and planned to impose economic boycotts on UN member states that support the partition. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Yemen, Outer Jordan, and Lebanon are expected to issue similar warnings.</p>
<h3>United States Proposes New Plan to Resolve Balkan Disputes Peacefully; Albania and Bulgaria Must Meet Conditions to Participate in Discussions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] The United States has achieved a decisive victory over the Soviet Union in a test vote on the Balkan dispute, requesting the UN to establish a special committee, including the five major powers, to seek to stop the long-term conflict between Greece and its neighbors. The United States also accused Greece's Soviet-backed neighbors, Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, asking the General Assembly to condemn their support of guerrillas fighting the Greek government. The General Assembly's Political Committee acted quickly, first considering applications from non-member states Albania and Bulgaria to participate in the debate on the Balkan issue. The United States agreed, but only if the two countries guaranteed that when invited to participate in discussions on the Greek issue, they would respect their obligations to peacefully resolve disputes under the provisions of the Charter. The Soviet bloc opposed this entirely, saying that the Assembly should not bind Albania and Bulgaria. The committee ultimately passed the American proposal by a vote of 38 to 6, with Arab nations abstaining.</p>
<h3>South Africa Condemned for Disregarding UN Resolutions; Chinese Representative Liu Kai Speaks Righteously</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] South African representative Lawrence reiterated today in the UN Trusteeship Council that South Africa refused to place Southwest Africa under the trusteeship of UN institutions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 25th] Because the Union of South Africa failed to comply with the resolutions of the previous UN General Assembly to place Southwest Africa under UN trusteeship, it was attacked by non-colonial countries in the Trusteeship Council today. Chinese representative Liu Kai sympathized with the movement of the people of non-self-governing territories and criticized South Africa for failing to fulfill the trusteeship agreement. Liu pointed out that placing formerly mandated territories under UN trusteeship was a moral obligation of the administering state, and that the administering state's continued exclusion from the trusteeship system was inexcusable. Liu further stated that the General Assembly should authorize the Trusteeship Council to consider the information provided by the Union of South Africa regarding the South African situation, rather than continuing to assign this task to the Trusteeship Committee. The first to launch an attack on South Africa today was India, whose representative accused South Africa of disregarding the will of the General Assembly.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 26th] At the 61st meeting of the US-Soviet Joint Commission today, the Soviet chief representative, Lieutenant General Shtikov, suddenly proposed that US and Soviet troops withdraw from Korea next spring. Shtikov's proposal stated in essence: At the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union advocated Korean trusteeship, but the United States has been uncooperative. For the freedom and independence of Korea, the Soviet Union has tried its best to achieve it. At present, the Korean people are all seeking the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea. We believe it is necessary to satisfy the wishes of the Korean people, so we propose that US and Soviet troops withdraw next spring. We hope the US will respond immediately.</p>
<h3>Truman Concerned About European Situation; Considers Interim Aid; Clayton Estimates $2.5 Billion Needed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] President Truman said today that in order to maintain and promote the political stability and economic recovery of the sixteen European countries, the United States must provide rapid "interim aid." He said that the urgent situation in Europe is awaiting the fate of the Marshall Plan, and the US government is planning to draft a plan to aid Western Europe without convening a special session of Congress. This issue must be decided by the leaders of Congress, and he will meet with them on the 29th.</p>
<p>President Truman declined to estimate the cost of interim financial assistance, but said that Undersecretary of State Clayton had estimated the amount at $2.5 billion, which the State Department did not deny. The President also praised the formal statement in the report of the Paris Conference of the sixteen European countries, calling it an "important and gratifying first step" toward economic cooperation. The economic recovery problem mentioned in the Paris Conference report is not only related to the political and economic stability of Europe but also is the key to world stability and peace. The document is only a preliminary report and must be carefully reviewed and revised by the United States, and discussed with European experts to expand its scope. Truman also said that the three committees he appointed have been tasked with assessing the European plan based on the ability of the United States to meet European needs.</p>
<p>[United Press, Southampton, England, 26th] US Undersecretary of State Clayton and Ambassador to Britain Douglas departed today on the Queen Elizabeth liner to return home to report to President Truman on the economic situation in Britain and Europe.</p>
<h3>France's US Dollar Reserves Will Be Exhausted Within a Month</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that France's US dollar reserves would be exhausted within a month, and that if the United States did not provide assistance, it would have to stop all US dollar purchases. Without assistance in October, the entire prospect of France's economic recovery would be hampered. Assistance in November or December would be too late.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Optimistic That German Recovery Has a Foundation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 25th] US Treasury Secretary Snyder left Berlin for Paris this afternoon. Before leaving, he gave a speech, saying that although the situation in Germany was serious, the foundation for recovery had been laid. He said: "I believe that if Germany can work hard in the coming years, it will definitely be able to greatly improve its economic life." According to US military governor Clay, Snyder's trip was to gather information on whether Germany could be included in the Marshall Plan for European aid.</p>
<h3>Taft Criticizes Government, Believes Foreign Policy Has Made a Big Mistake; Firmly Opposes US Foreign Loans</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tacoma, Washington, 25th] Republican Senator Taft gave a speech here today at the World Affairs Council, detailing the Republican Party's position on US foreign policy, criticizing the government for making a big mistake with its "stubborn philosophy" in the international situation. It is said that in terms of war, we have won, but in terms of peace, we have failed. The current world situation is as critical as it was in 1940. Only MacArthur's occupation of Japan, the establishment of the United Nations, and the recent signing of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance in Brazil have brought a ray of light. The United States should immediately stop lending to the world, believing that the United States cannot save the world with money alone. The Marshall Plan for European aid should be based on the principle of special loans and limited to special purposes such as repaying US goods. A peace treaty with Japan must be concluded immediately to allow the country to be self-sufficient. If we allow a country's living standards to be lower than other countries, then that country will be able to produce cheap goods and compete with the United States around the world. This is related to the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and US policy should strive to effectively raise the living standards of all countries, including defeated countries.</p>
<h3>Impasse on Admission of Five Former Axis Satellite States; Security Council Debate Yields No Result</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 25th] The Security Council today reconsidered the applications of the five former Axis satellite states to join the United Nations, but a new deadlock formed again due to British accusations of Soviet behavior as "unusual bargaining." The Security Council discussed Poland's proposal this morning, asking the Security Council to recommend [Blank] and [Blank] to join the United Nations. Soviet representative Gromyko stated that now that the peace treaty has been approved, he is willing to support the application of [Blank]. Less than a month ago, he would have vetoed the application, but with the condition of recommending Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and [Blank] to join. This caused great debate, with most member states, including China, the United States, and Britain, holding the same position, requiring that each country's application be considered separately and not voted on as a whole. [Blank] (Chairman of the Security Council) finally agreed with the majority opinion and immediately began discussing Hungary's request. The United States launched a fierce attack on the current government of Hungary, while the Soviet Union tried its best to defend it. As a result, no decision was made. The Security Council then decided to discuss the matter again on the 29th.</p>

<h3>Right-Wing Members of the Japanese House of Councillors Respond to Shigeru Yoshida's New Party Movement</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The Ryokufūkai, a group of right-wing members of the Japanese House of Councillors, believing that the time is ripe due to the imminent approach of the Japanese peace treaty, has decided to form a political party. Shigeru Yoshida, the former Japanese Prime Minister and President of the Liberal Party, has been in talks with Tsuneo Matsudaira, the Chairman of the Ryokufūkai, since this summer regarding the formation of a new conservative party. On September 2nd, in addition to Yoshida and Matsudaira, Tameharu Katayama, Honorary President of the Democratic Party, and Naotake Satō, Chairman of the House of Councillors Foreign Affairs Committee, joined the talks, forming a "Big Four" meeting. They stated their goal of establishing a strong conservative cabinet to deal with the peace treaty. Today, the Ryokufūkai held its first meeting convened by seven new party preparatory members, including Yukio Ozaki. At the meeting, they first decided to turn the Ryokufūkai into a political party. However, the party's name and political platform have not yet been announced. Tsuneo Matsudaira is considered the most likely candidate for party leader. However, within the Ryokufūkai, which comprises about half of the House of Councillors members, there is considerable unease among those dissatisfied with forming a party under the influence of the Liberal Party. It is rumored that some members will join the Social Democratic and Democratic parties.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] General MacArthur today completed his review of the Japanese Coal Mine Law and returned it to Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama with an attached letter stating that he would not oppose the nationalization of coal mines.

<h3>Councillors Unanimously Pass Resolution Requesting Central Government to Temporarily Suspend Dance Ban; No One Opposed During the Vote</h3>
<p>[Our own dispatch] The Municipal Council held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon. Important decisions were made on both the proposal for electricity conservation in the city and the dance ban issue, with detailed and heated discussions.</p>
<p>Regarding the dance ban, with a vote of 82 out of 96 councillors, a resolution was passed "to request the Central Government to reconsider the dance ban order, stating the reasons. The city government will temporarily suspend the execution of the Central Government's ban in this city." When the Speaker put the resolution to a vote, inquiring if there were any objections, not a single councillor raised their hand.</p>
<p>The discussion began with Deputy Speaker Yu Ji, who has lived in Shanghai for 36 years and never danced with anyone, expressing his opinion that a dance ban was unnecessary. Mr. Xu explained three reasons why a dance ban was unnecessary: Dance halls are businesses approved by the government and the Social Affairs Bureau. If the government suddenly bans businesses that have already been approved, then any business in the future can be banned. Dancing is a public entertainment, and dance halls are public places. If public entertainment is not allowed, many people will inevitably turn to private entertainment venues. There are many unemployed people in Shanghai, and no measures have been taken to help those who are already unemployed. How can we increase the number of unemployed people? Other councillors also rose to oppose the dance ban. Zhang Zhihan stated: The government should be responsible for Shanghai's extravagance because the import of luxury goods is the cause of this trend. Conservation is about saving foreign exchange. If it is taken from the Chinese people and used for the Chinese people, and indirectly helps the people, then it should not be banned at all. For example, Xia Danwei's dance hall makes more than 100 million in ticket sales a day. We should let these wealthy people generously donate, indirectly increasing tax revenue. Otherwise, it will be impossible to ask the Director of the Finance Bureau to collect taxes from them.</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun said, "Conservation is a small matter, starvation is a big matter." After the dance ban, not only dance hostesses and dance industry workers will be unemployed, but also people in various related industries such as department stores and fashion companies will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>In the middle of the discussion, councillors asked Director Wu Kaixian to report on the relief measures after the dance ban. Director Wu explained the three measures previously announced by the city government and said that he was well aware that the problems after the dance ban would be very difficult and he was acting under orders. At that time, a small interlude occurred. Zhang Zhihan asked: "Since the government has issued an order and the city government has accepted it, why are you asking the council for its opinion? If you are seeking public opinion, why should you respect the council's opinion? Isn't that contradictory?" Director Wu immediately replied wittily: "I am an appointed official, not elected by the people. I was appointed by the central government, so I must obey the central government. But I am supervised by the people's representative body, so I must respect public opinion. Therefore, there is no contradiction at all." Wang Xianqing believes that not only should dancing not be banned, but it should be promoted. He said, "If you see dancing and don't think it's strange, its strangeness will disappear on its own."</p>
<p>Later, female councillor Tian Shujun expressed her views on the dance ban issue. Ms. Tian also did not advocate for the dance ban, expressed sympathy for the dance hostesses, and hoped that the dance ban would be postponed for three years. Then Tao Baichuan explained based on the constitution that the dance ban issue was a matter of people's legislation and not within the scope of central legislation. The government's order should not violate the constitution. If there is a violation, the local government is not responsible and does not need to obey the central government, otherwise it will be a mistake. Therefore, not only regarding the dance ban, the government should repeal similar legislation in the future. However, Mayor Wu stood up and explained that the city government could not not implement the central government's order, nor could it postpone it. Finally, Speaker Pan collected opinions from all parties and drafted the above resolution, which was passed by the assembly.</p>
<h3>Assembly Approves Amended Electricity Conservation Measures</h3>
<p>[Our own dispatch] City councillors had quite different opinions on the "electricity conservation" proposal. The Council's Public Utilities Committee reviewed the proposal the day before yesterday and expressed support for electricity conservation, but amended the city government's proposed electricity conservation measures. However, during yesterday's assembly discussion, some councillors fundamentally</p>
<p>Opposed</p>
<p>electricity conservation. There were many reasons for this: Lu Shi Dao resolutely opposed it, saying that saving electricity would only increase the income of some meter readers and administrators, an "emperor." Moreover, citizens pay many kinds of taxes, and if they don't even have a little right to enjoy water and electricity, how can they win the people's hearts? Yang Fusheng said that while electricity consumption by large industrial factories is important, other industries, especially handicrafts such as printing houses and typesetting rooms, all need electricity and cannot save it. Zhang Zhongyuan also said that if electricity consumption by shops is reduced, it will affect business.</p>
<p>Those who</p>
<p>Supported</p>
<p>electricity conservation were more numerous. Zhu Wende said: Corruption is a social disease, and we cannot stop talking about electricity conservation because of this disease. In addition, saving electricity can increase production and improve work efficiency. Developing industry and increasing production must rely on electricity. Business development has nothing to do with the amount of electricity. The reason why business is not developed is because people's purchasing power is weak, not because the lights are not installed beautifully, which reduces business income. Zhang Zhusan and Zhang Zhihan also listed reasons for agreeing to save electricity. When the discussion came to an end, the Speaker first put the motion of whether to fundamentally oppose electricity conservation to a vote. As a result, only 12 voted against, and it did not pass.</p>
<h3>Standard for Ordinary Electricity Users is 40 Degrees</h3>
<p>Following the discussion of the electricity conservation measures submitted by the mayor, amendments were made to the review opinions of the subcommittee. It was resolved that the original measures (see page 4 of this newspaper on September 9 for details) Article 1 be amended to the electricity consumption of ordinary electric light and electric heat users, with 40 degrees as the standard (electricity meters with the same household name are calculated together), limited to the highest electricity consumption in the three months of March, April, and May of this year. Electricity within the standard degree will be charged according to the prescribed electricity price. Electricity within the standard limit will be charged at twice the prescribed electricity price. The part exceeding the limit will be fined four times the prescribed electricity price for the first time, and six times the prescribed electricity price for the second time (both including the base amount). For the third and subsequent offenses, in addition to six times the rate, the [missing characters, likely involve punitive] measures, such as [missing characters, likely disconnection] power, may be taken depending on the circumstances.</p>
<h3>Supplemental Four Points</h3>
<p>In addition to the seven measures of the Municipal Government, the subcommittee supplemented four points, which were also revised and decided upon by the assembly: Any factory that already has power generation equipment shall generate electricity within one and a half months after the passage of this measure. If it is insufficient, the power company will supply the electricity. No power generation subsidies will be given to factories that generate electricity for their own use. If electricity is supplied to citizens for use, subsidies may be granted at the discretion of the authorities. Schools and doctors' clinics with electrotherapy equipment will receive preferential treatment in terms of electricity consumption. Military organs shall be charged for electricity without exception, and relevant organs are requested to strictly enforce this.</p>
<p>Mayor's Opinion</p>
<p>Mayor Wu expressed to the assembly his hope to revise the above two items regarding "factories with their own power generation equipment," still granting subsidies, because factories with their own power generation should be encouraged, as their costs are more expensive than those supplied by the power company, hoping for subsidies. However, this was opposed by the senators. Some senators believe that factories such as the China Textile Mill all have power generation equipment, although their costs are higher, but the price of yarn is rising daily, and slightly increasing electricity costs has little impact on actual income, so unless it is supplied for civilian use, no subsidies should be given. The above amendments and supplementary opinions were passed by a majority of one hundred and ten out of one hundred and twelve senators.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Director Zhao yesterday replied to senators' inquiries about "when can electricity conservation be lifted?" stating: It will be lifted after the new generator arrives next year. An American-made new generator with a capacity of 115,000 kilowatts has already arrived.</p>
<p>Committee's Review of the Proposed Borrowing of the Ewo Garden Fails to Conclude</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Senate's four committees on public works, land administration, finance, and regulations, held a joint review yesterday morning of the proposal to borrow the Hardoon Garden and open it as a park. First, Mayor Wu reported on the negotiations with the owner of the Hardoon Garden, stating that the owner initially refused to lease it. Later, the Bureau of Public Works advocated requisitioning it, but ultimately, there were no clear provisions in the Land Law, nor was there such a huge requisitioning fund of 12.1 billion yuan. According to Luo Jialing's second will, the Municipal Government could receive a donation of 2 million yuan, which was worth about half of the Hardoon Garden at the time. If it could be based on this will, the Municipal Government would only need to requisition half of it. However, this did not materialize because the owner did not recognize the validity of the second will. Later, through the mediation of Du Yuesheng, Xi Yushu, and Gu Jiatang, the owner agreed to donate 15 mu of land and allocate three-tenths of its charitable fund, about US$450,000, to build a library, etc. Then, Speaker Pan explained that this case in the Third Congress was based on Proposal No. 1 of the First Congress, which originally was "borrowing" and "leasing," not "requisitioning." If "requisitioning" is desired, it needs to be discussed in another case. Subsequently, the senators expressed their opinions one after another, with some advocating requisitioning and some advocating accepting the donation. There was still no result by noon, so it was decided to submit it to the Congress for discussion.</p>

<h3>Dance Industry Willing to Donate One Day's Income</h3>
<p>Suggest Monthly Charity Sale Once</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, representatives of the dance industry in this city, Sun Hongyuan, Tang Zongjie, and three others, took a letter of suggestion to the Municipal Senate for submission. The content stated that in order to respond to the authorities' austerity movement, the dance industry is willing to hold a charity sale one day each month starting next month. All of the business income of the capitalists, the dance tickets of the dancers, the tips of the employees, and the salaries of the musicians will be entirely presented to the Senate for distribution. It is estimated that the 29 dance halls in this city can earn 300 million yuan from one day of charity sales.</p>
<h3>Starting Point for Imposing Banquet Tax Decided to be Changed to 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Senate passed several other proposals yesterday. The Speaker submitted a proposal "The Shanghai Wine Industry Association requests that the starting point for the banquet tax be adjusted according to the price index." The Congress decided to change the starting point to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The temporary motion by Jin Runxiang, Yan Esheng, Liu Jingji, and others, "Please request the Municipal Government to consult the Ministry of Finance to lift the restriction that checks cannot be used for payment," was passed.</p>
<p>The temporary motion by Tao Baichuan and others, "In order to reward the Baozhang (ward chiefs) of various districts for their hard work and commendable efforts in this conscription, it is proposed that the Municipal Government select the best and award them certificates or prizes to encourage them," was passed.</p>
<h3>Low Salaries of Military and Police - Congress Passes Improvements</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Senate's Research Committee on improving the treatment of soldiers and police presented several research conclusions yesterday, which were passed by the Congress:</p>
<p>The treatment of military and police in this city is indeed too meager and needs to be improved.</p>
<p>The way to improve is to invite the leading groups in this city to discuss raising several billion yuan for the military and police welfare fund in the shortest possible time, and appoint representatives to jointly manage it. The usage method will be determined separately.</p>
<p>The fundraising target should be concentrated on the wealthy to avoid increasing the burden on ordinary citizens.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Illegal Foreign Exchange Speculation Cracked - Suspicious Letters, Cables, and Account Books Confiscated</h3>
<p>Recently, the trend of private foreign exchange speculation in this city has been rampant. The Economic Section of the Police Bureau, based on intercepted secret telegrams and tips, investigated and discovered two cases of private foreign exchange speculation with major suspicions:</p>
<p>Jihelong at No. 7, Lane 110, Jixiang Street, whose business is import and export, and manager Wu Bingyi, recently sent a telegram to his friend in Hong Kong, the text of which was "40 boxes of medlar." After obtaining this telegram, the police bureau suspected it deeply, so they sent personnel to inspect it yesterday afternoon. They seized dozens of cipher books, telegram drafts, letter drafts, and account books, and took Wu Bingyi and the company's accountant Chen Bonian to the bureau for questioning. Wu confessed to private foreign exchange speculation without hesitation. Last month, he speculated a total of about 600 million yuan. The "40 boxes of medlar" mentioned in the telegram was actually the code for "40,000 Hong Kong dollars." Wu and Chen have been temporarily released on bail.</p>
<p>Guangming Import and Export at Room 47, 3rd Floor, No. 119 Renji Road, was secretly reported to have private foreign exchange speculation. Police officers went to the location to inspect and obtained many suspicious account books and correspondence notes. Chen Shaoyan, the person in charge of the firm, was taken to the bureau for questioning. According to his confession, the firm was jointly operated by him and Zheng Shenbai, Ni Zengxiang, and others. The source of foreign exchange was one from foreign deposits, two from fund transfers, and three from the Central Bank. The scope of business was quite extensive. The part of the firm's private foreign exchange speculation will be determined by the Central Bank after reviewing the seized account books. Chen Shaoyan was temporarily released on bail.</p>
<h3>Employer Not Accepting Conditions - Haianing Company Struck Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The American Haianing Company was purchased by our Ministry of National Defense and is about to be taken over. The company's more than 200 permanent and temporary workers, fearing being laid off, made demands to the employer a few days ago, requesting six months' severance pay, two months' year-end bonus, and other conditions. The employer refused, so the more than 200 employees surrounded the factory until late at night the day before yesterday and went on strike yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently persuading and mediating.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The employees of the Four Banks and One Bureau went on a mass hunger strike for one meal at noon yesterday to express a "silent protest" because their salaries for this month were reduced and their demands have not received a concrete response. However, they still worked as usual. According to the person in charge of the banks and bureau, there is no division between labor and capital in the Four Banks and One Bureau. They serve the country as a whole, and their nature is very different from that of general commercial banks. The authorities of each bank and bureau expressed great sympathy for the current difficult situation of the employees, but they could not help them. The demands raised by the employees have been forwarded to the government authorities for final approval.</p>
<h3>Family Members of Victims of Iron Barge Explosion Plead for Compensation</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The dancers in this city are facing extinction after the dance ban. They specially appointed five representatives, Sun Zhimin, Meng Yan, Shen Lifang, Hong Xiaoping, and Jin Meihong, to gather at the Dance Industry Trade Union yesterday morning and go to the Xingzhong Society to ask Ms. Tian Shujun, a director of the Municipal Women's Association, to guide them to the residence of Chairman Chiang Kai-Shek's wife on Dongping Road to plead for assistance. Tian told them that Madam Chiang was unable to meet due to business, and that the Municipal Women's Association would hold a second joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the New Life Club at 3:00 pm to discuss the dance ban. Chen Yiyun was sent by the Central Government to attend and provide guidance, and they could attend as observers.</p>
<p>Madam Chiang's Concern</p>
<p>At the joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Women's Association, Jin Zhenyu served as chairman and explained the purpose of the meeting. Then, Central Committee member and female senator Chen Yiyun was invited to give a speech. Chen said that she had recently talked with Madam Chiang about the dance ban in Nanjing, and Madam Chiang was very concerned about the future of the dancers after the dance ban. However, because the government has set laws and regulations that cannot be opposed, and the date of the dance ban is imminent, Madam Chiang hopes that Shanghai women can find a way to solve the aftermath of the dance ban for the dancers. Senator Chen also said: When the senators Zhang Zhijiang and others proposed the dance ban at the Standing Senate Committee meeting, she would have opposed it, but because her strength was insufficient, it was eventually passed by the Congress. Dancer representative Jin Meihong then reported on the actual living situation, claiming that dancing is a legitimate profession. If it is said that dancing is harmful to public morals, then after the dance ban, many dancers may be forced to do even more harmful things to public morals. At present, the dancers in various dance halls in this city have mostly automatically implemented austerity. If the government cannot withdraw the order to ban dancing, it is hoped that it can help arrange the dancers' change of careers. Moreover, the dancers' own problems after the dance ban are minor. Their family members who rely on them for living expenses and their younger siblings or children who rely on them for education will also lose their dependence and opportunities for cultivation. Subsequently, the directors and supervisors present successively expressed their opinions, expressing great sympathy for the dancers' situation and hoping to find a proper solution.</p>
<p>Five Resolutions</p>
<p>Finally, after discussion, it was resolved:</p>
<p>Request the government to extend the dance ban for one year. During this period, no new dance halls will be added, and no more dancers will be registered. Dancers will not use luxury goods, and their clothing will be changed to domestic products.</p>
<p>The Women's Association will run vocational schools and handicraft classes, and request the government to allocate a portion of the funds, and request that one or two percent be added to the current dance tickets as operating expenses.</p>
<p>The Women's Association will send representatives to the Central Government and Madam Chiang to express their opinions on the dance ban.</p>
<p>Please Madam Chiang and the Central Women's Movement Committee and the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee to assist in unison.</p>
<p>Establish a committee to assist dancers in changing careers, and elect Jin Zhenyu, Tian Shujun, Ling Yingzhen, Zhang Hongwei, Lu Huimin, Chen Shaoqi, Lu Yunqian, Zhu Su'e, Xie Yonghua, Ling Qishen, Zhao Zhimei, Ling Qirui, Yu Hongqun, Cheng Hailun, Li Suzhen, and fifteen others as members.</p>
<h3>Wife and Concubine Face Each Other in Court - Court Investigation to Determine</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the execution of the traitor Liang Hongzhi, his property has been confiscated except for a necessary living allowance for his family. However, most of the small valuables and jewelry were hidden by his several concubines to evade confiscation. Liang's daughter-in-law Wu Manyin and daughter Liang Zhuoli had disputes with Liang's concubines Liang Zhao and Liang Ding because of settling the property. Yesterday afternoon, the four faced each other in the criminal court of the High Court.

Liang Zhao and Liang Ding claimed that the home was sealed up after the victory, and only a few boxes were taken away, which have now been emptied. The rumors of possessing huge amounts of money are misunderstandings. The court clerk recorded the statements and will make a decision after investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The promotional meeting for the austerity movement in this city was held at the gymnasium at 9:00 am yesterday. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life attended. Mayor Wu, chairman of the meeting, said in his speech: Austerity is an inherent virtue of China. Foreigners have always praised the Chinese people for their spirit of enduring hardship, hard work, self-reliance, and frugality. However, in post-war China, especially in Shanghai, the atmosphere of extravagance has become increasingly prevalent, affecting the past virtues of austerity. Today, the poor and civil servants in the country have nothing to save. However, there are still many people in Shanghai living an extravagant life of debauchery. This atmosphere should be quickly eradicated so that the entire citizenry can be consistently frugal. We should advise the citizens of Shanghai that extravagance is not an honor but a disgrace. The citizens of Shanghai should earnestly implement austerity and set an example for the people of the whole country. Speaker Pan gave a speech, stating that the propaganda for austerity in Shanghai has begun to be implemented. He hoped that the citizens of the city would do their best to persuade and urge society to practice austerity, increase production, and reduce consumption, and use social forces to automatically and spontaneously remedy the current crisis. He deeply hoped that every citizen would be as frugal as possible in their living habits and complete the austerity movement. Finally, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, and others successively gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at noon. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the propaganda and make the citizens universally aware of the meaning of austerity, the association specially invited the party, government, and military leaders and local celebrities of the city to broadcast in turn on Shanghai Radio Station No. 7, Daxilu Road, starting yesterday.</p>

<h3>Apprentices Complain and Request Solutions - Municipal Government Has Taken Measures to Improve - No More Abuse</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Government received a letter from a self-proclaimed stationery apprentice a few days ago, complaining about the hardships of life and listing various questions requesting solutions. The Municipal Government believes that the apprentice system in China's industry and commerce is an abnormal contractual act. There are many cases where the teachers or shop owners are very concerned about the apprentices and treat them like family members, but there are also those who arbitrarily order them around, do not show compassion, and regard them as slaves and servants. Moreover, most of the apprentices are children. Due to heavy workload and insufficient nutrition, their normal development is hindered, affecting their physical and mental health. This is the worst of all. These accumulated habits that violate humanitarianism should be eradicated to improve the situation. The Municipal Government has ordered the police bureau to crack down on acts of abuse of apprentices at any time and ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the industry associations to notify their member firms to quickly find ways to improve the treatment of apprentices based on the actual situation of each firm. They must not be bound by prejudice and engage in destructive and abusive behavior.</p>
<h3>Last Four Days - Shenbao Education Fund Hopes for Enthusiastic Donations</h3>

<p>Time passes quickly. Four days have already passed. Including today, there are still four full days until the end of the month. In these four days, we earnestly hope that people in society who care for young people will donate more so that this "Reader Education Fund" can achieve a satisfactory result. Dear readers: "Helping students is the best deed, and doing good is the greatest joy." Let us work together to complete this most meaningful work.</p>

<h3>Alluring Corpse in Bunker: Bizarre Murder Case Discovered in Jinan - Strangled with Rope, Chopped with Knife, Covered in Blood</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Jinan, 23rd] At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, a nude female corpse was found in a fortification bunker at the intersection of Jing Si Road and Wei Shi Road in Jinan. After the police and court sent personnel to the scene for inspection, multiple suspects were detained. The case is bizarre, and authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Sex of Corpse Undetermined at Time of Discovery</p>
<p>Niu Dingchen, a 59-year-old refugee from Xintai County living in the Jinan Xintai County Native Association at 155 Jing Si Road and Wei Shi Road, got up around 9:00 AM on the 23rd to urinate. As it was raining and he suffered from paralysis, making it difficult to walk, he went to the fortification bunker outside his door to relieve himself. To his shock, he saw a naked corpse inside the bunker. He did not have time to determine whether it was male or female, nor did he urinate, but immediately rushed out and told his fellow villager, Tang Yulin, who reported it to the Baojia head. The Baojia head then reported it to the Shangxi Branch Bureau. Bureau Chief Zhong Dianbin immediately led officers to the scene, maintained order, and notified the Jinan District Court.</p>
<p>Around Twenty Years Old, Completely Naked</p>
<p>Hearing the news, our reporter also braved the rain to arrive at the scene. Inside the bunker lay a female corpse. She had short hair and unbound feet. Estimating her age, she was approximately twenty years old, with a pretty face and fair, plump skin. She was completely naked, and there were no clothes left near the body. It was the corpse of an alluring young woman, not resembling someone from the red-light district. There was a knife wound about an inch long in the middle of her neck, shaped like a triangle, with drops of blood. A white cloth strip was also tied around her neck, and her mouth was stuffed with flowered cloth, which appeared to be her lower garment. Her eyes were tightly closed, and her eyelids were red. Opposite this bunker was another, facing each other across the road. The female corpse was discovered in the bunker on the west side of the road, while a blue Shilin cloth dress and a pair of blue cloth-soled shoes were found at the firing port of the bunker on the east side of the road. The bunker facing the street had no accessible door, with the door being inside a certain clothing factory. Criminal police officers entered the clothing factory to investigate, finding the bunker entrance piled high with cotton clothing bundles, heavily covered in dust, as if they had not been moved. As the court had not yet sent personnel for inspection, the police bureau preserved the original state of the scene. Although it was drizzling, a large crowd gathered to watch.</p>
<p>Court Sends Personnel to the Scene for Inspection</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM, Court Prosecutor Qin Shuofu, Wu Tingxian, Clerk Wu Zhensan, inspectors, and court police arrived at the scene to conduct an inspection. The inspection revealed that the female corpse had first been strangled with a rope and then fatally stabbed with a knife. The woman was not a virgin, but there was no evidence of sexual assault. They then entered the bunker from the clothing factory and retrieved the clothing from the firing port. In addition to the dress and cloth shoes, there was also a pink rayon underwear and a pair of beige socks, all neatly folded without any bloodstains. They then inspected the Xintai County Native Association and questioned the male and female foremen of the clothing factory, who all replied that they did not recognize the deceased.</p>
<p>Detain Suspects, Bury the Alluring Corpse</p>
<p>After the court and police jointly inspected and questioned, they dealt with the witnesses separately. Zhang Jingbo, the person in charge of the Jinan Clothing Factory, and Cen Yuting, a worker, were considered to be highly suspicious. The factory owner was notified, and they were temporarily handed over to Yu Jingwu, the squad leader of the Third Inspection District of the Defense Command, for custody. Female workers Lu Xiuying and Wang Fengying were also released on bail pending further investigation. The other witnesses, including Niu Dingchen, Fei Mian, the messenger of the clothing factory, Li Yanming, the messenger, and Police Chief Yang Renjun, were all released. Because no one claimed the deceased, the court issued a burial certificate, ordering the local authorities to bury her.</p>

<h3>Eight Boys in One Birth - Sets New World Record for Childbirth</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Yixing, 24th] The niece-in-law of Zhang Shuping, Director of the Direct Tax Bureau in this county, gave birth to eight boys in one birth, which is a rare and astonishing event in the world. Our reporter visited Director Zhang to inquire about this matter. He confirmed that it was true and promised to send a photo within two weeks, which will be published in our newspaper at that time. The details are briefly described below: The Zhang family is from Ningjin, Hebei. They left their hometown due to the devastation caused by the communists and traveled south, having been on the road for over two years. They have been serving in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. Director Zhang was transferred to Yixing in May of this year. Director Zhang's elderly father still lives in Tianjin. News about Ningjin is relayed through letters from his father. His nephew, Zhang Bingwei, worked with his grandfather in Tianjin after the communists occupied Ningjin. He is currently 26 years old and married a 27-year-old woman named Wang. She stayed in her hometown of Houchang Village, Yangpan Town, northeast of Ningjin, taking care of household chores. Four years ago, Zhang Wang displayed signs of pregnancy, craving sour foods, sleeping often, and generally feeling weak and unwilling to work. After several months, her abdomen became significantly enlarged, and everyone assumed she was pregnant. However, time passed without a birth, and her abdomen remained swollen. The family suspected she was seriously ill. Then, on the 17th day of the fifth lunar month this year, she suddenly went into labor and gave birth to eight boys in one birth. The birth was intermittent but without significant pain. One of the eight boys died shortly after birth, but the other seven boys and the mother are all healthy, which can be called a miracle and may break the world record for childbirth. According to a letter from Director Zhang's relative, Mr. Liu: "The communists also consider it a world miracle. They are very concerned about the Zhang Wang mother and children, providing them with supplies from time to time and hiring five wet nurses. Therefore, there are no problems with their living conditions."</p>

Hand over the editor; 2. Publish an apology in a prominent position; 3. If the above conditions were not accepted, they would take free action. After negotiations, the Military and Civilian Daily published an "Apology to Muslims" today, stating, "This draft was reprinted from a Nanjing newspaper on September 11. Due to the editor's temporary negligence, the article was not carefully reviewed, resulting in an insult to Muslims, which is regrettable. In addition to suspending the comprehensive edition and severely punishing the editor, we respectfully extend our apologies to our Muslim compatriots."</p>

<p>Seven Scientific Organizations - Issue Joint Declaration - Offer Advice on Scientific Research</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The</p>
<p>Science Society of China, the</p>
<p>Natural Science Society of China</p>
<p>, the Astronomical Society of China</p>
<p>, the Meteorological Society of China</p>
<p>, the Geographical Society of China, the Zoological Society of China, and the Anatomical Society of China held a joint annual meeting in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. The seven organizations provided opinions after the meeting as a</p>
<p>joint declaration. The opinions are published as follows: Atomic energy issues: We believe that</p>
<p>scientific research should aim to improve the welfare of mankind, and the research on atomic energy is no exception. The discovery that the atomic nucleus can be split coincided with the life-and-death struggle between democratic and dictatorial countries, so scientists used atomic energy for weapons of war. The misfortune of atomic energy is also the misfortune of scientific research. Now that the war has ended, democratic countries are working hard to cooperate. We advocate that this kind of research should be open, free, and move towards world peace and human welfare; we do not want to see this invention that can benefit mankind become a cruel weapon, nor do we want to see the unity of democratic countries undermined or the freedom of scientific research endangered because of the atomic energy weapons race or keeping the secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing. For this reason, we are willing to support the Atomic Energy Education Committee advocated by Professor Einstein and the alliance organized by American atomic scientists.</p>
<p>Domestic scientific research issues: The people of our country are struggling on the hunger line in the atomic energy era. One of the reasons is the backwardness of science. The meaning of scientific development is originally to improve the living standards of the people, and the degree of improvement should be proportional to the degree of scientific development. In the past, people in our country did not attach importance to basic science. Once they entered the atomic energy era, they chased after importing one or two instruments related to atomic energy research to keep pace with the scientifically advanced countries at that time, which is really impossible. We believe that if we want to seek the development of science in our country, we should start from the root, such as enriching the books and instruments for science education, and guaranteeing the lives of scientists who practice research and education; especially important is that scientific undertakings should have a definite budget and a long-term plan, and should not be like the Three Gorges Water Conservancy Project, which is started and stopped repeatedly, so that the promotion of science will not be like the ship and gun policy of the past, only to be ridiculed by people all over the world, and science can become an important factor in our nation-building and benefiting the people.</p>

<p>in an endless stream. They were low at first and then high, and the</p>
<p>stocks rose and fell unevenly, and the rises and falls were narrow. Large households deliberately absorbed Xinhe. The stock rose sharply alone</p>
<p>, which was very lively. People's hearts were uncertain, and the process and trend were inevitably erratic.</p>
<p>In the morning</p>
<p>, because the silver was very tight, and</p>
<p>the report of the reduction of the security deposit,</p>
<p>the Ministry of Finance strongly denied it and it was low, but after opening,</p>
<p>it was stimulated by the sharp contraction of the US exchange rate and aroused a buying</p>
<p>trend. Di Yong yarn rose to 269 yuan. After various</p>
<p>parties supplied Di Yong yarn, it fell to 263</p>
<p>yuan, but the silver was slightly loosened, and Di Yong yarn was pulled up to 273 yuan again. At 10:30, the interest</p>
<p>rate opened at 2 cents 4 points and 2 cents 8 and a half points,</p>
<p>slightly hovering, hovering around 270 yuan for a long time. Now Yong yarn and Di Yong yarn, with</p>
<p>the loosening of silver and the contraction of Hong Kong electricity, rose to</p>
<p>high prices of 267 yuan and 279 yuan near noon, and then closed at 265 yuan, and Di closed at 277 yuan</p>
<p>. The market was peaceful after closing. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yong yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, China Cement, and China Silk rose slightly.</p>
<p>Qinxing underwear, matches, Huaxin and Hengfeng fell slightly, Huafeng Lilian Rongfeng Zhabei were all flat, and</p>
<p>Xinhua fell by half a point. In terms of delivery stocks, Yong yarn, Xinhe, and Meiya rose slightly, and Huafeng was flat.</p>
<p>In the afternoon</p>
<p>, there was news of currency reform in the evening newspaper.</p>
<p>People's hearts were good at first and then flat,</p>
<p>so Yong yarn opened high to 283 yuan and was immediately sold short, forcing Di Yong yarn down to 273 and a half yuan</p>
<p>. At that time, Xinhe gradually rose, and the difference between the exchange of state-owned banks was not much, and then it was settled. Yong yarn</p>
<p>closed higher to 272 yuan and 279 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yong yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, China, Huaxin, Hengfeng, Rongfeng, Tongyi, China Silk, Match, Underwear, and Qinxing rose slightly.</p>
<p>Huafeng Chanbei was flat, Jinglun Dongxing Business fell slightly, Di Jiaogu Huafeng fell slightly, Yong yarn, Xinhe, and Meiya rose slightly, and various old stocks outside the market were calm and changed little.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Were Stagnant, Foreign Stocks Rose</h3>
<p>Public bonds traded little yesterday, only 2 million.</p>
<p>Most of the large households were on the sidelines, and only Ding and Wu were relatively strong.</p>
<p>The domestic bond opened at 13,300 yuan in the morning, fell to 12,700 yuan, and rebounded to 13,000</p>
<p>yuan before closing outside. Although the bank side was silent, the customer</p>
<p>side was also not interested. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Jia and Yi fell slightly by 100 yuan, the unified Bing was flat, the unified Ding rose by 500 yuan, and the unified Wu rose by 900 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to rise yesterday. Although the bank side sold out, the securities side sold out first and then bought in. Guang and foreign firms were all buying in. Yisha opened at 117,000 yuan in the morning</p>
<p>and gradually rose to 120,000 yuan before closing. As a result, compared with the previous closing, British United Paper Industry and Aviation Industry rose slightly, Wheelock Marden, Jardine Matheson Beer, Jardine Matheson yarn and telephone each rose by half a point, and Yip Guang Hsiang Tai rose by more than 10%.</p>

<h3>Qi Hong Traded in One Batch</h3>
<p>In the foreign tea market, the British merchant export company has been suppressing the price of this year's Qimen black tea. Because the goods side is trying to maintain the price and is reluctant to part with it, the transaction has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, in the market, some cargo owners who were adjusting funds frequently sold their goods, so the process suddenly became clear. The city totaled more than 100 boxes absorbed by Jardine Matheson, with a price of 1.75 million yuan per picul, and the market sentiment was slightly softer than before. For other patterns, buyers are still only sporadically interested, but suppliers are still determined to sell, so the situation is still standing. As for various domestic teas, both this street and the customer side have active destocking, and the green teas such as Huizhou fried green and baked green in this year's year are selling even more miraculously, and the market is rising again, and the rest are uniformly stable.</p>
<h3>Textile Adjustment Price Negotiations Stalled: Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Stop Rising and Start to Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Cotton Yarn Price Negotiation Committee of the Textile Adjustment Association,</p>
<p>did not make any changes yesterday. 20-count yarn remained at the</p>
<p>original price of 14.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Company yesterday, as usual, sold yarn in two groups, A and B.</p>
<p>Group A sold 1,976 pieces,</p>
<p>with 543 purchase orders. Group B sold 177</p>
<p>pieces, with 177 purchase orders. The two groups</p>
<p>sold a total of 2,153 pieces, equivalent to 20-count yarn,</p>
<p>with a total of 720 purchase orders.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw tightened credit</p>
<p>due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival. The authorities</p>
<p>were handling the registration of stored yarn, and industry</p>
<p>insiders were quite wary. Furthermore, the Textile Adjustment Association's</p>
<p>asking price remained unchanged, and many who had profited within the market were reselling a great deal,</p>
<p>causing a general decline in market momentum. By the close of the market, 42-count "Blue Phoenix"</p>
<p>yarn plummeted by 2.5 million compared to the previous day, falling to</p>
<p>25.2 million yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse</p>
<p>and fine yarns also uniformly and rapidly fell by 1 million to over 2 million</p>
<p>yuan respectively.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened in the morning with tightened credit conditions.</p>
<p>Customer interest in purchasing slackened, and industry insiders and small vendors</p>
<p>sold off their stocks, leading to lower opening prices for all goods. By 10:00</p>
<p>AM, the US dollar exchange rate suddenly rose, and market sentiment turned firm,</p>
<p>with active short covering, causing prices to rise again. Around 11:45</p>
<p>AM, prices fell again following the decline in yarn prices. At the close of the market,</p>
<p>"Dragon Head" fine cloth still saw a slight increase of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Bleached cloth, coarse cloth, dyed cloth, and Shilin cloth, etc., remained</p>
<p>strong and brisk, while the prices of other cloths saw mixed ups and downs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market stopped rising and started to fall.</p>
<p>Market sentiment weakened, and buyers were not eager to purchase</p>
<p>due to the slight pullback in cotton yarn prices. Due to the industry's</p>
<p>urgent credit needs, many were selling off their stocks,</p>
<p>causing market prices to decline. Yarn factories took advantage of the low prices to buy, and</p>
<p>transactions were slightly more active. Total daily trading volume was around 2,000 bales.</p>

<p>sluggish due to extremely tight credit conditions. In the morning, 120-count "Takayama"</p>
<p>rayon was traded at 48 million yuan for immediate delivery, and 9 million yuan for deferred delivery.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, market conditions weakened further, and the final price retreated to 8.5 million yuan,</p>
<p>a drop of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day's final price.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the factory silk market opened extremely weak</p>
<p>also due to the very tight credit conditions among industry players. Later, it was learned that</p>
<p>the exchange rate had been adjusted again, and the market became firm</p>

<p>opened lower. "Dazang Huachang" goods were initially traded at 7.65 million</p>
<p>yuan, but prices fell gradually, with the lowest price at 7.2 million yuan, fluctuating</p>
<p>between 7.2 million and 7.3 million yuan for a long time. Later, due to the high exchange rate,</p>
<p>market sentiment was revived, and prices rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in an instant. The closing price</p>
<p>for immediate delivery was 7.6 million yuan, and 7.8 million yuan for deferred delivery. The asking prices for "Meiya" quilts</p>

<h3>Idle Talk About Examinations</h3>
<p>— Que Yizhi</p>
<p>Editor's Note: At the editor's request, the author of this article uses the perspective of the examination hall to view the miscellaneous scenes of academia. Here, the author raises questions, points out the difficulties faced by university students in enrolling a month ago, and writes about the various forms and formalities of the examination hall. This is a valuable piece of writing amidst the sound of the opening of universities.</p>
<p>The annual entrance examination for new students is held in the sweltering heat of August, as usual.</p>
<p>Schools have to spend a lot of money, and candidates travel from afar, exhausted.</p>
<p>Some say that this is also a waste of manpower and resources.</p>
<p>In order to keep the examination confidential, the test questions must be printed behind closed doors. Several staff members and</p>
<p>workers, from the time they enter the "gate," cannot step beyond the bounds of the pool for their daily life,</p>
<p>until the examination is completed before they are released. Leaking test questions can be punishable by imprisonment.</p>
<p>Grading papers is a tedious task, too monotonous.</p>
<p>Looking at the same papers every day, there are few</p>
<p>correct answers and many wrong ones, which does not arouse the interest of the graders.</p>
<p>There are so many examination papers, and the weather is so hot.</p>
<p>Waving a fan and wiping sweat is not enough, and one has to concentrate</p>
<p>and go through them one by one, which is truly</p>
<p>frustrating. After becoming tired, it is inevitable</p>
<p>to mark the grades carelessly. However, the fate of the candidates is determined here.</p>
<p>One must truly show leniency and be considerate of the candidates' hard work,</p>
<p>spend more effort and time, and not "do things according to one's own will" or "observe the mood."</p>
<p>The number of candidates is increasing year by year, and admission is becoming more and more difficult.</p>
<p>It is said that there are 200,000 high school graduates in the country this year, and universities and vocational schools across the country can accommodate about 30,000 people.</p>
<p>What about the remaining 170,000 people? Are all of them below the standard?</p>
<p>If their standards are not up to par, they should not be allowed to graduate in the first place. Since they have graduated,</p>
<p>efforts should be made to allow them to continue their studies. Although not all high school graduates want to go to college,</p>
<p>most of them are preparing for further education. To say the least, at least 100,000 of the 170,000 people</p>
<p>will be deprived of education. This is a major problem in education, and also a very serious social problem.</p>
<p>The current party and league are paying attention to "ensuring equal opportunities for young people to continue their studies and find employment."</p>
<p>It is hoped that they can think of practical solutions for them.</p>
<p>The economic circumstances of the candidates' families vary greatly.</p>
<p>As seen in the examination hall, some are dressed in elegant Western suits,</p>
<p>while others are wearing only a single undershirt. Some are wearing white leather shoes,</p>
<p>while others are wearing straw sandals. There are modern city girls with oiled hair and powdered faces, wearing diamond rings,</p>
<p>and there are also country girls with disheveled hair and wearing blue cloth gowns.</p>
<p>Moreover, some candidates come to Shanghai from afar, with no money to stay in hotels.</p>
<p>After the examination, they stay overnight in the examination hall. As for temporarily sleeping</p>
<p>on the floors of the corridors or classrooms of the schools they are applying to,</p>
<p>there are even more. This illustrates that a portion of the families</p>
<p>are economically depressed and the countryside is bankrupt. These students cannot afford to go to college.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are also many who have the means to study. In an examination hall</p>
<p>with 220 people, I counted that 48 people were using new-style Parker fountain pens.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there were also many who used domestic fountain pens. If we use this to infer</p>
<p>the candidates' family economic situation, we can at least say that one-fourth of them are well-off and one-fourth of them</p>
<p>are very poor. To "ensure equal opportunities for continuing education,"</p>
<p>government scholarships should be specifically awarded to these aspiring, outstanding, and impoverished young intellectuals.</p>
<p>Do not let those young masters take public funds to dance and watch movies!</p>
<p>To enrich one's academic abilities, one must study regularly. Digging a well when one is already thirsty will not help in time.</p>
<p>There is a common phenomenon among candidates: before entering the examination hall, almost everyone</p>
<p>is holding a "Application Guide," "Further Education Guide," "Detailed Explanation of University Exam Questions,"</p>
<p>... This fully reveals that their usual studies are insufficient, so they can only cram at the last minute.</p>
<p>Cheating in the examination hall is also commonplace. Passing notes,</p>
<p>peeking, carrying cheat sheets, exchanging papers, switching seats,</p>
<p>and hiring substitutes all occur. There are many ways to carry cheat sheets.</p>
<p>The most ingenious is that a female student wrote the mathematical formulas with an ink pen on her snowy white</p>
<p>thigh. Writing on the palm of the hand is not considered rare. Comparing photos is an effective way to prevent candidates from impersonating others.</p>
<p>Some faces are special and can be identified at a glance. Some are ambiguous and difficult to judge.</p>
<p>In particular, it is even more difficult to distinguish between brothers taking the exam on behalf of each other.</p>
<p>My personal experience is that the shape of the ear can be used to distinguish between true and false.</p>
<p>Going to the examination hall is like going to the battlefield. One must rely entirely on one's true abilities.</p>
<p>Those with good abilities are sought after everywhere and do not need to ask someone to "introduce," "recommend," or "promote,"</p>
<p>... I dare say that now general universities all handle admissions through an organizing committee.</p>
<p>The power is independent, and even the president cannot interfere. The examination procedures are so complicated, the number of people is so large,</p>
<p>and everything is sealed. The admission standards are decided at a meeting.</p>
<p>Who can get through the "connections"? Therefore, it is absolutely impossible</p>
<p>to seek "relationships" or do "under-the-table work" to be admitted.</p>
<p>I often advise students who fail the exam not to be discouraged.</p>
<p>The exam is fair, and they should try again and again. If they are not admitted this year, they should come again next year.</p>
<p>If they have the ambition, they will eventually be able to achieve their wishes.</p>
<p>Indeed, enrolling new students is a major event for the school.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is a major turning point in the life history of the candidates. Entering the university</p>
<p>allows them to pursue advanced studies, with unlimited prospects and immeasurable opportunities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, failing the exam leads to a change of career, not seeking to improve,</p>
<p>and living a mediocre life. Therefore, this turning point has a great impact on the future of young intellectuals.</p>
<p>Is our current examination system, with its limited number of admissions and large number of applicants, perfect?</p>
<p>Can we imitate the universities in Paris, London, and New York,</p>
<p>admit tens of thousands of commuting students and open up greatly,</p>
<p>so that every aspiring young intellectual can have the opportunity to study?</p>
<p>I think this is something that government authorities and people in society should consider.</p>
<h3>Lifelong Friendship</h3>
<p>— Shufeng</p>
<p>In this society that "values clothes more than people,"</p>
<p>most people are inclined to each other for profit and associate with each other according to power.</p>
<p>Among friends, those who can truly show benevolence and righteousness and be honest with each other are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>Everywhere we look, what we see is mostly a group of so-called "relatives and friends"</p>
<p>who kick people when they are down or turn a blind eye to each other.</p>
<p>As for talking about the "phrase" "lifelong friendship," it truly evokes</p>
<p>endless emotions and sighs at the degeneration of people's hearts and the fickleness of the world.</p>
<p>It is said that during the Spring and Autumn period, King Yuan of Chu admired benevolence and righteousness and recruited talented people.</p>
<p>Many scholars came to him after hearing the news. There was a poor scholar named Zuo Botao,</p>
<p>who also carried his books and food to the State of Chu, hoping to be reused by King Chu and display his grand strategy.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Yongzhou, he met Yang Jiao'ai.</p>
<p>The two poor scholars hit it off and became sworn brothers.</p>
<p>Together, they went to Chu. When they passed Liangshan, they encountered a snowstorm.</p>
<p>Zuo Botao thought that the journey ahead was long and the clothes and food they had brought were limited,</p>
<p>and they could not have both. So, he "took off his clothes and shared his food,"</p>
<p>freezing himself to death in the forest. Instead, he told Yang Jiao'ai to take his clothes and food</p>
<p>and go to Chu alone. Later, Yang Jiao'ai was indeed appointed as a senior official,</p>
<p>and he even asked King Chu for permission to bury Zuo Botao generously.</p>
<p>However, because Zuo Botao's tomb was too close to Jing Ke's tomb, his spirit was often insulted by Jing Ke.</p>
<p>Yang Jiao'ai could not bear Zuo Botao being bullied by Jing Ke, so he also committed suicide in front of Zuo Botao's tomb,</p>
<p>burying himself beside it to help Zuo resist Jing in death and to follow Zuo Botao in the underworld.</p>
<p>Although this matter is inevitably absurd, the two men, Zuo Botao and Yang Jiao'ai, who sacrificed their lives for friendship,</p>
<p>are worthy of praise. The four words "lifelong friendship" are truly worthy of Zuo and Yang.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, at the same time (around 600 BC), there were also two "lifelong friends" in Greek history,</p>
<p>two Athenian youths, one named Cratinos and one named Aristodemos.</p>
<p>At that time, Athens was in turmoil after the Cylon rebellion, and people's hearts were fluctuating, making it difficult to calm down.</p>
<p>After Cylon seized power, he thought that he must make a sensational statement to cover up his guilt,</p>
<p>so that he could legitimately start anew with the people and change the people's intentions.</p>
<p>So, he invited the virtuous and well-known Epimenides to hold this atonement ceremony.</p>
<p>As a result, the "sacred fire" was rekindled on the altars everywhere, and rich sacrifices were offered on the altars again.</p>
<p>However, in the grand ceremony, a "person" had to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Both Cratinos and Aristodemos were extremely willing to sacrifice themselves to seek the happiness of their country.</p>
<p>However, whichever of them died, the other would never be willing to survive alone,</p>
<p>because they had deep friendship and a shared desire to die on the same day.</p>
<p>Therefore, the two of them made a sacrifice together, and in this superstitious act,</p>
<p>for the sake of their country and for the sake of their friendship, they shed their blood,</p>
<p>smearing it on the altar. This story illustrates the story of a pair of "lifelong friends"</p>
<p>who lived in the same era as Zuo and Yang, but in different regions. It can be said to be</p>
<p>"uncommon."</p>
<p>Looking at the two East-West stories above, we can see that although they were in two slightly similar situations,</p>
<p>and in two regions that never communicated with each other, their heroic acts of sacrificing themselves for friendship can truly illuminate</p>
<p>the ages and shame ordinary unrighteous people.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends from America</p>
<p>— Xu Ziyuan</p>
<h3>American-Style Vegetarian Dishes Eaten Raw</h3>
<p>When Americans dine, they always start with a plate of raw vegetables, with many varieties.</p>
<p>Commonly, it is raw tomatoes and raw cabbage. More refined ones have shredded chicken and raw cabbage, or assorted fruits.</p>
<p>Why don't Americans get worms from eating raw vegetables? Because American farms do not use manure to water vegetables,</p>
<p>but use disinfected tap water. Therefore, raw vegetables cannot become a medium for infectious diseases. In America,</p>
<p>you will never find toilet paper in your raw vegetables. The Western restaurants in Shanghai also imitate this,</p>
<p>fully Americanizing. Before I start eating, I always turn the raw vegetables over a few times to see if there is any</p>
<p>toilet paper inside. But the infectious bacteria hiding in the fibers cannot be caught. In order to</p>
<p>show that I am Westernized, I have to eat the unsanitary vegetables. This will not make the host lose face,</p>
<p>nor will I be considered a country bumpkin by the special guests. But before the large manure party is used as fertilizer,</p>
<p>it is always unsanitary to eat raw vegetables. Although manure donation is a large source of income for the municipal authorities,</p>
<p>and the huge price of manure itself has created the wealth of many manure kings,</p>
<p>a large portion of the income from manure is offset by the expenditure on disease prevention.</p>
<p>If the bacteria transmitted from raw vegetables each year were to be statistically analyzed, there would definitely be an alarming number.</p>
<p>When I occasionally sit in the Cathay Hotel or the Huizhong Hotel,</p>
<p>when I see the people at the next table eating raw vegetables, I get the feeling</p>
<p>that they are devouring toilet paper and bacteria. After eating, they inevitably have to get a vaccination to prevent the bacteria from causing trouble.</p>
<p>Why not cook the raw vegetables before eating them? American style requires American</p>
<p>conditions. At the very least, it can be said that manure and vegetables are mortal enemies.</p>
<h3>The Metaphor of Chinese, Indian, and Japanese Folding Fans</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>After reading the broadcast address given by Indian Ambassador Luo Jialun in New Delhi on August 18,</p>
<p>saying that the Indian bloodless revolution was a complete success, declaring it an unprecedented achievement in history, I thought of several articles in Zhang Taiyan's book.</p>
<p>Mr. Taiyan had a deep study of India.</p>
<p>He had a preface to the Indian Brahmin Baushatvayu II,</p>
<p>recording the words of Brahmin: "I heard that thousands of years ago, there were two Indian and Japanese monks</p>
<p>who came to China at the same time. The Chinese monk invited them in and talked very happily.</p>
<p>He said: "Are the three countries like folding fans?</p>
<p>India is the paper, China is the bamboo frame, and Japan is the rope for tying the handle.</p>
<p>If the two countries revive one day, and agree with Japan to be in Asia, they should be like</p>
<p>this folding fan." Alas, now the paper and the bamboo frame are both decayed, and only the ring rope remains.</p>
<p>Can it restore the old shape of the folding fan? It is unknowable..."</p>
<p>(This was written in the 40th year of Meiji, and is also repeated in the article "Record of the Commemoration of the Indian Shivaji King")</p>
<p>Now China, which has won the Anti-Japanese War, although</p>
<p>still in decay, has finally removed the ring rope.</p>
<p>Fortunately, India, as the paper of the folding fan,</p>
<p>has been completely renewed. Our not very complete bamboo frame</p>
<p>needs to be repaired urgently. If it is repaired well, and a new and beautiful paper is put on,</p>
<p>(meaning cooperation with India) wouldn't it be enough to form a very beautiful folding fan?</p>
<p>The folding fan does not necessarily need the ring rope of the handle.</p>
<p>It can be replaced with other things or discarded.</p>
<p>But I am afraid that someone will use that ring rope to bind this exquisite folding fan</p>
<p>with paper and bamboo frame.</p>

<h3>Random Collection of Doggerel</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>A single mooncake costs a fortune,</p>
<p>Sweet to the mouth, bitter to the heart;</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival orders frugality,</p>
<p>But all that's seen on the streets is gift-givers!</p>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, mooncakes appear on the market,</p>
<p>with some priced as high as tens of thousands of yuan apiece.</p>
<p>Although "orders are issued for frugality,"</p>
<p>the streets are filled with people coming and going to give gifts.</p>
<p>With commodity prices soaring so high, the mooncake</p>
<p>is "sweet to the mouth" but "bitter</p>
<p>to the heart"!</p>
<h3>Weekly Film Review</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>The Incoherent and Confused "South Seas Love Song"</p>
<p>This film uses</p>
<p>a love triangle</p>
<p>to depict the martyrdom of</p>
<p>the Malay local girl, Lotus. However, due to the lack of creative ability</p>
<p>of the screenwriter, the story in the script seems pieced together from various sources.</p>
<p>The male lead, Luo Qianglun, already knows that Lotus's kidnapping and disappearance</p>
<p>are his father's conspiracy, so why is he willing to return to Hong Kong with his father?</p>
<p>This example is enough to illustrate that</p>
<p>the screenwriter disregards whether the development of the plot is reasonable,</p>
<p>simply wanting to complete this tragedy at will. In the end, besides</p>
<p>a tragedy that is as incoherent and confused as it is now, what else can one expect?</p>
<p>Among the actors, Ji Hezi is mediocre, and Wang Hao is forever the same old</p>
<p>expression, lacking creativity. Yao Ping's singing is extremely clumsy.</p>
<p>The Subpar "Grievances of a Wealthy Family"</p>
<p>"Grievances of a Wealthy Family" attempts to portray the decline</p>
<p>of a feudal aristocratic family,</p>
<p>but the author only focuses on</p>
<p>the personnel disputes within this large family. It's like a series of endless</p>
<p>illustrations, tirelessly reenacting these unmoving</p>
<p>stories, making the audience feel weary. Especially important, the author</p>
<p>does not vigorously criticize these characters, so the reason for the decline</p>
<p>leaves the audience with no gains from this film, resulting in nothing</p>
<p>achieved.</p>
<p>The performance is also unremarkable, and the director's incompetence is</p>
<p>the main reason for the failure. At the same time, among these actors, except for Ba Qiu</p>
<p>Xia, who is somewhat satisfactory, none of the others</p>
<p>are acceptable. Especially Zhang Ying's portrayal of the young master and Ba Hong's portrayal of the third young master are simply terrible.</p>
<p>The Unremarkable "Spring Traces by the Sea"</p>
<p>Clark Gable returned to film</p>
<p>after the war, paired with</p>
<p>Greer Garson as the female lead, making for a strong cast, but</p>
<p>the film fails to satisfy us. First of all, the content of the script</p>
<p>depicts the love between a sailor and a female librarian.</p>
<p>It's purely "American style." From acquaintance</p>
<p>to love, it takes less than a day, only three days,</p>
<p>and they get married. A week later, they announce their</p>
<p>divorce. Everything is like child's play. Who can say this isn't</p>
<p>nonsense?</p>
<p>Clark Gable's sailor is glib and smooth-tongued, acting</p>
<p>over the top and making him annoying. Greer Garson is only average.</p>
<p>The performance of the great director Victor Fleming is also unremarkable.</p>
<p>The Mediocre "New Red Flower Serenade"</p>
<p>"New Red Flower</p>
<p>Serenade" is set against</p>
<p>the background of Havana</p>
<p>in South America,</p>
<p>interweaving an unoriginal multi-angle love story. The main</p>
<p>reason is to arrange the tropical song and dance of Carmen Miranda, who is known as the "South American shemale," but this strangely shaped</p>
<p>"shemale" is no longer</p>
<p>considered novel in the eyes of the Shanghai audience. In addition, the story itself lacks moving</p>
<p>elements, and the scenery of South America is not fully showcased, so "New</p>
<p>Red Flower Serenade" is just a mediocre musical.</p>
<p>Carmen Miranda always uses the same old tricks. Alice Faye and John Payne naturally</p>
<p>won't have any brilliant performances in such a film either.</p>
<p>The color in this film is still good.</p>
<p>The Excellent Documentary "China's Resistance War"</p>
<p>On the screen, it seems that we</p>
<p>have not yet seen</p>
<p>a systematic film</p>
<p>introducing the historical facts of China's War of Resistance. The currently screening</p>
<p>"China's Resistance War" is a relatively satisfactory</p>
<p>documentary.</p>
<p>Here, we must thank American director Frank Capra</p>
<p>for his excellent editing skills. Although some places use too many</p>
<p>repeated shots, that may be due to his lack of familiarity with the Chinese</p>
<p>situation, resulting in the use of shots of a certain event</p>
<p>for several different regional events.</p>
<p>To familiar Chinese people, this is impossible not to be recognized.</p>
<p>—— But I still recommend this documentary that is worth watching.</p>
<p>The Not Worth Watching "The Abandoned Woman"</p>
<p>"The Abandoned Woman" uses</p>
<p>sensational advertisements to lure</p>
<p>the audience, but the audience is</p>
<p>left disappointed. Because, in fact, this film is not worth</p>
<p>watching. The story is extremely bland, the performance is also dull</p>
<p>and unbearable, and the film is also short, without any of the so-called "sexy" or "licentious" things advertised. These are all</p>
<p>gimmicks to fool the audience. As for the Laurel and Hardy short film "The Shrewish Wife and the Clumsy Husband" added to the start of the film, it is an old and outdated</p>
<p>comedy short.</p>
