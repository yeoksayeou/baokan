<h3>蔣主席公畢由瀋返京　行前曾召見熊式輝等有所指示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕蔣主席卅日赴瀋視事畢，卅一日上午十一時原機離瀋，四時半平安返抵京，俞濟時·劉斐等亦同返。主席在瀋時，曾召見東北黨政軍負責人，有所垂詢。</p>
<p>〔中央瀋陽卅一日電〕蔣主席卅一日晨八時召見熊主任，鄭副長官，趙參謀長等有所指示，九時召見東北行轅政治委員會委員，垂詢各情，十一時廿分乘機離瀋返京，熊式輝·鄭洞國·王叔銘·張廷孟·徐　·金鎮等均至機場恭送。蔣主席蒞瀋消息，卅一日此間晚報大字刊出，市民閱悉，無不異常振奮。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽卅日電〕蔣主席偕劉次長為車，俞局長濟時等四十餘人卅日分乘專機三架，於下午五時由京滬飛抵瀋。熊主任式輝，鄭副長官洞國，王副總司令叔銘等，前往機場恭迎，主席下機後，逕赴行館休息，六時召見熊主任以下各高級軍事長官，垂詢甚詳，下午七時約熊主任共進晚餐。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽卅一日電〕蔣主席去歲蒞瀋，迄今整一年，此次蒞臨，不願驚動民眾，僅在瀋停留十九小時。</p>
<h3>參會迅速進行討論　通過提案達百餘件　建議政府修改中蘇條約</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕參政會第十四次會卅一日晨舉行，開始討論提案。九時半開會，出席參政員一九二人，林虎主席，計通過對國防報告審查意見，對外交，僑務報告審查意見曁提案六十件，計第一審查委會四十五件，內分關於國防者四件，關於兵役者四件，關於軍事攤派者三件，關於華北軍事者四伯，關於軍紀者二件，關於地方武力者九件，關於軍隊待遇者三件，關於軍事教育與訓練者二件，關於編餘軍官之安置及抗屬撫卹者五件，其他九件。第二審委會十四件，計關於日本賠償者四件，關於澳門，香港及滇緬問題者三件，關於外交人事制度者一件，關於僑務者四件，關於中蘇條約者一件，其他二件。全部提案討論，結果以送請政府參酌辦理者最多，其次有　請政府辦理或切實辦理者，其他則為請原提案人撤回或保留，討論順利。在軍事國防部份，僅王參政員國源等提「請政府明令停止徵實案」及李參政員培國等提「請中央履行取締游雜部隊樹立民眾武力案」，兩案略作討論，前案經楊不平等說明該案應予修改，建議政府就徵兵實之制度予以改良，而不必予以保留，旋後經該組召集人王澤民予以說明審查經過，眾意應予保留，當經表決後，仍以一一七票多數通過，照審查意見予以保留。後案中「游雜部隊」問題，各方發言熱烈，咸認為「游雜部隊」四字不妥，且彼等不戰時及地方保衛方面頗有功績，不應取締，當決定改為「請中央嚴行整訓熱河地方部隊，樹立民眾武力案，」並決送請政府辦理。其次，第二審查委會中，關於日本賠償部份，林忠提「管制日本，我國應爭取主動地位，拆運日本賠償物資，徵調台省技術人才，協助拆運日本賠償物資一項中，「台省」二字改為「各省」，其次關於王參政員普涵等提「為確保領土完整，維持國內秩序，應請政府提議修改中蘇友好條約，迅將旅順·大連收回案」，原審查小組中，認為應行保留，因目前中蘇邦交動盡之際，在中蘇條約尙未執行前，再行提出請求修正，對事實上之困難甚多，同時，如此項問題提出後，反應不如理想，是否反增邦交之不利，黃宇人，謝冰心等均力主此說，認為應予保留。謝氏又提出說明，認為此案如經通過，無異對蘇外交提出一神經戰，有所刺激。召集人周謙沖亦再度說明審查經過，惟王音涵·潘朝英等均強調稱，檢討中蘇友好條約全文實有割裂我國領土，損害我國主權，限制我國行政等情勢，故力主搟出送請政府辦理，一時會場空氣熱烈，發言者極為踴躍，旋經主席歸納各方意見大約為送請政府切實辦理及保留兩項意見；經表決，以在場一六四人中，一二三人贊同「送請政府切實辦理」，而獲通過。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕參會卅一日下午三時三刻舉行十五次會，以最快速率討論各審查委會報告，出席參員一九五人，李璜主席。會中共通過文教提案七三件，教育報告審查意見一件，財經案二四件，交通案廿六件，政治案廿一件，臨時動議七件，總共通過提案一五一件，教育報告審查意見一件，僅三案保留，會議至下午六時三刻許始散。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕參政會一日上午續開大會，討論各組審查報告。</p>
<h3>改革幣制建議送請政府採納</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕參政員尹蓮賢等所提建議政府改革幣制案，業經參會卅一日午後十五次會通過，送請政府切實研究，採擇施行。該案今日於會中提出後，孫繩武等主張此案僅能送請政府參考，若照審查意見通過，送請政府切實研究採擇施行，則恐足影響市面。第四審查委會召集人陳豹隱起立說明此一提案理由殊充實，所提辦法亦多可採處，故審查會中決議送請政府切實研究採擇施行，其實所謂切實研究，採擇施行與所謂送請政府參考，並無多大不同之處。至此案通過將引起市場波動之說，審查會亦曾注意及此，並信不致有重大影響。最後照審查意見通過。茲誌尹氏原提案所建議之四項辦法於後：（一）發行以金為担保之新紙幣，其發行準備不得少於百分之五十，發行數額應有限制；（二）已發行之法幣仍作輔幣使用，不再增發，並確定共與新幣之比值，（三）應確定新幣與美元或金鎊之比值，以求其信用之穩定；（四）新幣應獨立發行，建立獨立發行制度</p>
<p>又卅一日會中所通過其他有關金融重要提案，有下列數件：（一）奚倫等提，擬請政府恢復法幣發行比例準備制，藉以重建法幣信用，穩定法幣價值案，本案送請政府採擇施行；（二）王維新等提，中國版圖之內，應完全使用法幣，所有區域性之幣制，應即一律廢止案，修正通過，請政府切實辦理。（三）魏際青等提，擬請政府停止發行鉅額鈔票，使物價穩定以挽救經濟危機案，本案送請政府參考；（四）奚倫等提，擬請政府准許人民以黃金外匯輸入許可物資，俾可利用民間自有力量而謀物資充裕及物價穩定案，本案通過，送請政府採擇施行。</p>
<h3>伊盟全境安謐</h3>
<p>陳玉甲赴張垣述職</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏卅日電〕伊盟全境安謐，警備司令陳玉甲，廿九日夜由綏赴張垣謁傅作義述職。</p>
<h3>對日和平會議應在瀋陽舉行</h3>
<p>潘朝英等臨時動議</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕潘朝英等五十二人，頃向參會提出臨時動議，請政府即採取主動外交，選定九月十八日在瀋陽舉行對日和會，並請政府即日照會有關各國政府，同時成立機構，作招待國際嘉賓之準備。</p>
<h3>民社黨糾紛經過</h3>
<p>張君勱招待記者報告</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨昨日午後三時招待記者，張君勱·徐傅霖·馮今白·戢翼翹·楊毓滋·金侯城等均出席。各報記者，以張君勱平時避見記者，今日特予提起，張氏當場表示歉意，並說明苦衷。繼即對該黨之內部糾紛，作一綜合報告，</p>
<p>張氏報告後，各記者紛紛提出詢問，經分別答覆如下：（一）開除黨籍，並非永久性質，在法理範圍內，希望能早日予以恢復。伍憲子不致參加革新派，亦不致與民社黨分開。（二）關於海外委員要求伍憲子代表廿五票，出席組委會，為張氏堅拒之說；張初時加以否認，繼則謂不能接受此項要求。（三）關於學潮，謂當用勸導方式，逮捕並非上策，不得已實施逮捕時，當依司法手續。至於平息學潮之道，應致力於解決學生認為不滿意之事，例如教師待遇及學生伙食之改善。（四）關於查封報館，亦應依司法手續辦理。（五）關於恢復和談，張氏認為政府應伸出和平之手，不問對方反響如何，即使對方無表示，亦並非失面子之事。有詢以貴黨預備對國事作何貢獻者，答為尙在考慮，此時不能發表。</p>
<h3>參會通過江庸等提案　請政府向美借款　由民意機關監督其用途</h3>
<p>〔本社南京卅一日電〕參政會卅一日午後舉行十五次會時，以多數票通過江庸等八十人所提「請政府迅速展開經濟復興工作，並迅向美國磋商借款，以供建設之用案」，會中決議，該案送請政府迅速辦理，並為使借款專供建設之用，而不致流為官僚資本計，決議他日借款成立後，由民意機關監督其用途。該案提出後，首由提案人江庸簡單說明，略謂：我國經久戰之後，各項建設，咸待展開，然以限於財力，工作未能順利實現，深盼美方能貸我鉅款，此案所以由參會提出者，乃表示此為全國人民公意，而非政府意志。繼即由各參政員紛紛發言，多數咸表贊成，僅陳耀東等認辦法有值得考慮之處。尹述賢支持江氏提案，指出此一提案通過後，有意助華之外國友人，對其本國說話時，當更有力。陳博生亦認，我經濟情形嚴重，為中外所共知，無庸諱言，本身旣無力自行建設，由本民意機關代表政府對美提出呼籲，實無不可。即就外國而論，由國會提出貸款之呼籲，亦不乏先例，反對由民意機關提出貸款呼籲者，為陳耀東，渠說明美土，美希借款已無問題，而我國借款至今未有成議者，問題不在美國，而實在我國未能提出具體計劃。同時，政府亦曾表示一切有賴自力更生，本會若通過貸款提案，說明我經濟已瀕崩潰，實非光榮之事，渠贊成由政府出面向美借款，而不主張參政會越俎代庖，榮照不贊成借到外款後供官僚資本發財，最後宣付表決，全場一四五人，以九十八票多數通過，送請政府迅速辦理。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京卅一日電〕據權威方面消息，關於美國進出口銀行貸華五億元借款事，中國政府已開始與美國政府磋商。關於貸款之用途計劃，中國政府早已送達華盛頓，目前已向美政府提出，然外交部對此未予評述。</p>
<h3>請緩辦選舉案決議予以保留</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕參會卅一日午後開會時，各參政員對本年度內各項選舉應否辦理一事，曾有激烈辯論。當時有人建議，由於國內局勢動盪不安，選舉應暫緩辦理，惟大多數主張，參會若通過此一提案，侵犯國大權限，且影響憲政實施，最後決議原案保留。</p>
<p>又廿一日會中通過其他有關憲政案件，有朱惠清等所提，增加立委職業代表名額案，沈之敬等提組織行憲準備工作調查團等案。</p>
<h3>晉發起簽名運動　請實行民生主義</h3>
<p>〔本報太原卅一日電〕晉各界領袖王懷明等廿餘人，為求實現和平，請中央堅決實行節制資本，耕者有其田的民生主義與國父遺敎，發起簽名運動，即電參會請公決，建議政府文有：「欲求國家真正和平，須先澈底根絕亂源，私有制度，漏下很大空隙，資本與土地成為共黨造亂因素，共黨趁此空隙，形成不可忽視的破壞力量，正計劃三個月內裹脅百萬壯丁，搜刋萬億財產之鬥爭資本，坐大之下談和，則愈使坐大，談戰則剿不勝剿，必須彌補了社會空隙，斬斷了造亂根源，而後談和可，談戰亦可，」等語。</p>
<h3>參政員關於和戰質詢　國防部書面答覆　目前軍事行動實非得已</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕國防部頃書面答覆參政員關於和戰質問各案，略稱，國防部之職責在保障和平，目前軍事行動完全被迫實出於不得已而行之。政府為顧全國家人民起見，一再忍讓，力謀和平安定，若有可以促成談判有效辦法，自當極所歡迎也。關於軍事基礎業已奠定，計共軍原佔縣城五五九縣，截止四月上旬已收復者達二三二縣，鐵路綫之收復者，計關內一一六五公里，關外五一四五公里，淮陰，臨沂，張家口，延安，皆為共軍根據地，亦經相繼收復，使其失卻政治與軍事之憑據，是國軍戰略上已收甚大成效，共軍失敗因素畢具，希望能於行憲之前，完成統一和平，使國家步入建設之途。</p>
<h3>和談案初步審查　草擬決議提下次會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕參會主題和談一案，前在全體審查會中，盡一日之討論後，即決定以全部紀錄移送特種審查委會，作慎重之研討。該會卅一日下午八時半舉行第一次，召集人胡霖主席，首說明：（一）張一善等臨時動義參政會，應以大會名義，通電全國，明是非別利害，確定國是，促進統一，民主，和平案；（二）特一審查會轉來吳蘊初等提農村破產民生凋敝，應設法救濟農村，俾農民安心耕作，增加生產案；（三）特三審查會轉來李鴻文等提，為戰局擴大，華北各箥人民死亡流離，困苦萬狀，請政府速決大計，以拯救數千萬無辜民命案。以上各案併入該審查會審查。</p>
<p>旋各參政員發表意見。江恒源稱：「今日會議大家應採和諧之態度商談，以解決問題，共謨國是」，故今日會議經過極為融洽，黃炎培·吳貽芳·許德珩等均相繼發言，各抒所見，諸氏意見較前接近多多，楊不平·王澤民等則提出無條件恢復和談，國共雙方立即停戰，參政會向雙方呼籲等意見。</p>
<p>各參政員僉盼迅速和談，停止戰爭，以解救國家危楊現人民之痛苦，希望中共參政員迅即來京出席參政會。趙雪峯，潘朝英等則主張要明是非，要認清戰爭責任。繼之要求發言之參政員甚為踴躍，但因時間關係，一部份未及發言。主席宣告歸納各參政員所提意見：（一）提案合併審查，（二）綜合褚輔成參政員等所提辦法，推舉起草人草擬決議交，提出下次會議讀者討論，當推定召集人曁許孝炎·胡秋原·尹述賢三參政員會同起草，並定一日晚八時舉行第二次審查會。</p>
<h3>立委開始調處學潮　參會提具體意見　京平學生明日停止遊行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕立委通過學潮工作，卅一日開始，呂復，陳顧遠，傅統先，譚惕吾，劉克僑，孫渠，夏濤聲，姜壽時等八人，卅一日兩度接見學生代表，並訪張羣，朱家驊，張厲生。渠等對學生勸解停止遊行，早日復課。對張羣等則請愛護青年，勿施壓力，十時與各立委談話之學生，為京，滬，蘇，浙，豫五區學聯代表王世德，鄧鴻舉等十人，當提出六項要求，請停止逮捕學生，並撤消維持社會秩序臨時辦法等。立委發言答覆者，為呂，陳，傅，譚四人咸勸導生勿於六二遊行，俾免發生不幸事件。王等表示：關於此事，彼等係代表，無權決定，容　　學相商，談話至十二時結束，各立委當往訪朱家驊，請曲意愛護青年學生。下午二時往訪張　，就撤消維持秩序辦法提出研究，張稱：此項辦法本人亦認有未盡妥適之處，然此非政府對羣生施壓力，實係愛護學生，予以預防，辦法旣經公布，撤銷頗感困難，且此次學潮有共黨份子從中煽惑，已極明顯。各立委當再申請愛護學生之意，張謂，滬捕學生事，本人已電吳市長查詢。下午三時各立委訪張厲生，亦就愛護學生問題商談甚久，晚八時呂等再度接見學生代表，勸導停止遊行，恢復上課。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕參政會卅一日午後所通過之教育報告審查意見，對消弭當前學潮，提出如下具體意見：此次學潮之起因，固有其種各因素，然當局措置未能盡臻妥善，人謀不臧，亦自應加以檢討。為今之計，教育宜從安定中求進步，未可多作不必要之更張，以免授人以柄。至於黨團派系如何退出學校，應責令各校負責人員時回商討，使之早日實現。學生之參加黨派者，學校應予登記，報紙應予發表，使之自負其言行之責任。會中鄒樹文曾建議，對應辦之教育措施，如若干學校之院系問題等，應即解決，會中決議加入原審查意見中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕據悉：在立法委員，參政員，治安當局，及各校校長教授之疏導下，京學潮已有轉機。學生方面，原準備六月二日遊行示威，現已決定停止舉行，各校即將逐漸恢復上課。</p>

<h3>對國防及外交報告　參政會通過決議文</h3>
<p>國防</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕參政會卅一日晨十四次會議通過之對國防部報告之決議文如下：</p>
<p>本會審查行政院工作報告中國防一項，並聽取國防部林次長口頭報告，獲悉國防當局對於復員整軍曁國防建設等事項，大致能按照計劃逐步實施，惟尙有待改進之處，茲就所見縷述如左：</p>
<p>整軍方針應予改變</p>
<p>（一）整軍方針，以目前需要，應予改變。軍隊之任務在於保國衛民，當茲邊疆防務尙未鞏固，地方秩序尙在紛亂之時，軍事重要，不減抗戰期間，故為鞏固國防，安定地方起見，整軍之方針，應為積極的力謀精兵主義之實現，並充實其質量。至於整編進行，宜就原有部隊，加以充實提高其素質，加強其訓練，並力謀精神政治物質之動員，配合軍事力理，而期達到保國衛民之任務。</p>
<p>（二）針對軍隊弱點，力求改善。</p>
<p>今日軍隊普通之弱點，乃為軍風紀之不良，官兵素質之低能，以及情報之不確，指揮之失靈等項。自當切實增加軍費，提高待遇，以謀官兵生活之改善。加強教育及情報之訓練，以提高素質。剔除積弊，整飭軍風紀，以增強軍隊之力量。而於指揮官之能力聲望，是否稱職，尤當切實注意，以謀將帥之協力。賞罰嚴明，綜　名實，以昭平允，尤為重要。</p>
<p>（三）充實地方武力，並力謀與軍政之配合。</p>
<p>以今日安定地方之迫切，　求國軍力量普遍推進，以收早日平亂之效，亟需充實地方武力，加以訓練，並隨時補充其彈藥，俾為國軍之助。而領導地方武力之軍官，尤宜就地取材，以收事半功倍之效。務使地方武力之充實，與軍政之設施，密切配合，達成地方早日安定之目的。</p>
<p>各種撫卹切實辦理</p>
<p>（四）種種上撫卹，宜切實辦理。</p>
<p>軍人獻身國家，出入鋒鏑，倘殘廢者無以養其生，死亡者無以卹其族，誠不足以昭激勵而賞有力。故撫卹之辦理，應迅速確實，卹金給與，亦須調整提高。此均關係士氣之振奮，至為重大。</p>
<p>（五）退役官佐，應迅妥善安置。</p>
<p>頃據國防部報告，退役軍官，已有二十五萬餘人，此等人員，多為抗戰有功之將士，自應選其精幹者，繼續錄用。其已辦理轉業者，亦應使其獲得工作之保障。而退役之官佐，尤應迅予資助其回籍，並責成地方政府予以工作之機會，或生產之補助。</p>
<p>（六）軍校學生，應儘量錄用。</p>
<p>軍事學校為軍事幹部之搖籃，國家教育培植，煞費苦心，其目的在使獻其所學，為國之用。今有投閒置散者，殊屬可惜，況目前軍隊幹部，尙惑缺乏，自一次設法儘量安置，實為必要。</p>
<p>外交</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕參政會卅一日晨十四次會議通過之對外交僑務報告決議文如次：</p>
<p>本會於審查外交部書面報告及聽取行政院張院長，外交部王部長之口頭報告後，深知政府之外交基本方針，在於企求我國與友孝間之和諧與協力及友邦與友邦間之和諧協力，擁護聯合國憲章，忠實履行條約義務，為我不易之信念，而對於保衛主權獨立與領土完整，以及保持我國際地位，維持世界和平，亦具有決心。本會以為，此項原則，尙屬正確允當，應不斷努力，以求其澈底實現，惟本會不能不提供意見，以為政府告者，約有數事：</p>
<p>（一）為對德和約問題，我國為聯盟國之一員，戰時旣比肩作戰，則戰後必須共草和約，毫無異議之餘地，況一九四五年九月倫敦五國外長會議曾有鄭重之決議，則對德媾和會議，不獨我國應為邀請國之一，即對德草擬和約之會議，我國亦有參加之權利，故望政府堅定立場，據理力爭，務底於成。</p>
<p>速擬對日和約草案</p>
<p>（二）為對日管制問題，我國乃受日本侵略，被害最慘之國家，對日管制政策，應本歷年本會建議，切實執行。我國對日決無報復之念，日本果能建立真正民主和平之國家，澈底摒棄侵略主義，則我國亦不吝予以更生之機會。我國出席華盛頓遠東委員會之代表及參加東京四國對日委員會之代表，應隨時隨事，闡明我國立場與決心，務使盟國能贊同我國嚴正之主張。至於當前之確定賠償數額，矯正教育思想，規定輕工業標準等問題，尤應根據詳密合理之方案，以期達成目的。對日議訂和約，為遲早必經之階級，我國應立於主動地位，從速妥擬對日和約之具體草案，至為重要。</p>
<p>（三）為對中蘇關係問題，政府根據中蘇友好條約，不斷作改善邦交之努力，惟蘇聯方面並未忠實履行該條約之規定，殊為遺憾，今後政府仍應使用一切外交方法，據理力爭，期達切實執行條約，早日收回東北主權之目的。對蘇軍在東北遷移工業設備，對當地人民所加之損害，應請政府繼續交涉，要求賠償，以維國權，而平民憤。至於旅大之收回，尤應根據條約迅速努力交涉，以保領土之完整。</p>
<p>交涉收回澳門港九</p>
<p>（四）為中英商約問題，英國為我國主要盟邦之一，中英關係素稱友好，為增進中英友誼起見，盼政府從速與英國商訂中英商約，以敦睦邦交而促進國際貿易。</p>
<p>（五）為保護僑民問題，政府應嚴令外部及僑委會，責成各使領切實執行保僑政策，并慎重使領人選，加強使領館僑務工作效能，以收保僑之實效。</p>
<p>（六）為收回澳門及九龍香港問題，此乃國人一致之要求，政府曾一再交涉，迄無結果。本會深盼政府切實繼續努力交涉，期以和平談判之精神，達成收復領土主權之目的。</p>

<h3>日本戰犯應早定讞</h3>
<p>東京麥帥總部法理司長卡本脫，五月廿八日談：日人天生獸性，目前雖暫時抑制，但一旦放縱，又將復萌故態。美國人今日對於日本人表面的殷勤，千萬不可受其馴良的欺騙。卡本脫氏又說：懲罰日本戰犯，乃爲最有價値之發展：因吾人可以藉此伸張國際公法。卡本脫是位國際法家，他楚檢舉日大一級戰犯的人，彼於檢舉日戰犯十七個月後，發表此論證，大約係對於遠東國際軍事法庭的戰犯審判，有所不滿；或認審判進行的迂緩，或以被吿辯護越出範圍，所以卡本脫乃有此警惕性之呼聲。我們認爲卡本脫氏的論蹬，明快而遠大，遠東國際法庭進行的戰犯審判，似亦有其應受輿論批判之處。</p>
<p>日本發動的中國戰爭和太平洋戰爭，是侵略戰爭；策劃主使或參加戰爭者，是戰爭罪犯，此已爲世人不移之定論。日本投降將兩年，關於日本戰犯的審判，我們看見有『遠東國際軍事法庭』乏組織，中國亦派有法官檢査官，參加審訊。關於戰犯之逮捕，當盟軍進駐日本後，前年九月十二日，先有東條英機等三九名，及黑龍會首領緒方竹虎，橋本欣五郞等七名之逮捕，九月廿一日有土肥原之逮捕，十一月十七日有荒木貞夫等十一名之逮捕，十二月一日有平沼騏一郞等五九名之逮捕，十二月六日有木戶幸一等九名之逮捕；去年一月廿三日至七月廿六日止，先後有長野祐一郞等九三名之逮捕。遠東國際法庭檢察處，於一年前提出『日本一級戰犯公訴書』，控訴荒木，土肥原，廣田，松井，東條，板垣，梅津，重光葵等廿八名，犯有破壞和平罪，戰爭罪，違反人道罪，及共同計劃或陰謀罪，列舉罪狀五十四件。這件公訴書的提出，較紐倫堡國際法庭判決納粹戰犯爲早，但日本戰犯的審判，去年六月三日始首次審訊，迄今已屆一年，僅甫經證人詰問階段，至現在的辯論階段。據審判長魏勃爵士說：審判時間如加速進行，今年年終可審判吿畢，事實上，審判時間日益拖延，被　辯論證據，日益有利：而懲罰戰犯的政治意義，亦日趨消失。明智者，對於日本戰犯審訊之迂緩，當然未能表示滿意。</p>
<p>遠東國際法庭的拖延，表現於事實的，有松岡洋右，永野修身在押的病死，侵略理論家大川周明裝瘋作傻的免予追訴，及『反對質詢』的採行。所謂反對質詢，又名『横質詢』，卽各級被吿律師可質詢證人，凡有利於被吿的事，無不據理反駁蹬人，藉以謀自身罪行之解脫。此種『反對質詢』，本爲英美法系的特色，去年秦德純，鮑威爾出庭作蹬，被吿五四名日美籍辯護律師，無不利用『反對質詢』，盡其混淆黑白，巧言遁詞之能事。他如審判長的態度，也使審判進行枝節横生，使檢察官深感不快。如去年八月六日，美檢察官莫羅代表檢察團提出日本俊華之控訴狀時，指責二十八名戰犯對侵略暴行，應全部負責。審判長魏勃竟謂：『何人可證明中國軍隊對日作戰，爲空前之作戰』？又說：『何人可證明日軍之行動較匈奴人更兇惡一？由於審判長的態度，對檢察官訴狀批評的嚴厲，所以今年四月廿二日一塲審判，東條的美籍律師竟謂「東條等多年來所言者，與杜魯門之主張如出一轍」，以辯論日本的侵略，是爲了恐懼共產主義的蔓延。美籍律師的出言，雖爲維護被吿的利益，要亦不免越出一般的常軌。凡此都足以使日本戰犯的審訊，曠時日久。我們實在戚到不滿</p>
<p>或有人以爲從容審理戰犯，將有益於歷史的眞實性，日本侵略陰謀，可完全坦白的昭吿於後世。這種希冀是錯誤的。東條，南次郞等之窮凶狡賴，土肥原，松井，梅津等之刁鑽陰狠，決難從審判中獲得徵信的資料；而且時間愈拖延，愈對戰犯有利。所以遠東國際法庭的長期審訊，實爲一種不必要的辦法，實應迅速修改。因此，我們主張戰犯審判應早完成，各重要戰犯應早定讞，提付典刑，以免世人懷疑盟軍的統治政策。抑尤有進者，一級戰犯土肥原，梅津，松井等，及「次級戰犯」如在押的影佐等，在華罪行斑斑可者，爲罪蹬搜集的便利，實有引渡來華審訊之必要。我們作此主張，對土肥原松井等一干人犯，幷無報復觀念，而係在建立幷鞏固國際法的原則，就是：「侵略戰爭是罪行。」</p>
<p>要之，年來日本戰犯的審理，不僅在時間上表現了迂緩，消耗了人力財力，而且又似乎頻於消失審訊的目的。卡本脫氏指出，懲罰日本戰犯，乃爲伸張國際公法，確為明快之論。我們以爲：爲了維護國際公法的莊嚴，爲了貫澈「侵略戰爭是罪犯」的原則，我們有權利要求將日本戰犯早日定讞！</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京卅一日電〕民主黨總裁蘆田卅一日發表談話，强調民主黨決意參加三黨聯合內閣之原因，並謂時局如此嚴重，僅以一部份少數之政黨擔負政治上之責任，殊爲不忠實於吾人之信念。至於左派問題，希待社會黨之善爲處置云。</p>

<h3>共黨蓄意攘奪政權　匈牙利發生政變　那基辭職狄奈繼任總理</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社匈京卅一日電〕匈牙利內閣今晨舉行特別會議後，決定總辭職。總理那基已先期提出辭職。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社匈京卅日電〕匈牙利總理即小地主黨領袖那基現在瑞士京城消渡似日，已於本日將辭呈交匈駐瑞士公使館轉呈匈政府。緣蘇聯於數日前曾指斥那基總理參與匈牙利之反民王陰謀，因此匈政府乃電那基總理立即返國，惟此間消息靈通人士咸認爲渠將留在瑞士不擬返國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社匈京卅一日電〕匈牙利內閣今日宣佈：陸軍部長狄奈（四十六歲）已被任命爲總理，繼那基遺缺。按狄奈係匈牙利著名足球員，此次大戰時僅任軍曹，數月前共黨逐出陸長巴薩及其他官負，狄氏始出任陸長。內閣又宣佈，又駐義公使柯台士已調任外長，接替蓋昂格奧西，在柯氏返國前，由情報部長米哈利暫代，蓋氏主張親近西方國家，致遭左翼各黨反對。聞匈牙利將於九月重新普選，盛傳共黨於　使那基去職後，已轉而壓迫總統蒂爾才就範。截至今晨爲止，共黨尙矚目於國家銀行前總裁奧特凡尼，但至最後一分鐘，蘇聯來電拒絕，奧氏出任總理之希望遂成泡影。蘇聯此舉之眞因現尙不明，惟國會方面傳說，此乃奧氏先世係日耳曼人，且曾在對蘇交戰之匈陸軍諜報處工作之故。</p>
<p>〔合衆社匈京卅一日電〕匈憲警對於叛亂案作新調査，現已有數人被逮，預料將續有人被捕。辭職總理那基之私人秘書卡波克斯今日已被逮，據警察稱，渠等發現卡氏藏有那基之女邱麗亞之函，內稱，「下次應用余現致君之密碼。」該函證明那基繼續與來自瑞士方面之地下活動，用密碼函接觸。警察又稱，發現之證據中，證明那基曾按時以小農黨所有之公司款項接濟叛徒。</p>
<h3>義大利政潮吿一段落　新內閣各單日內公布　社會共產兩黨被摒門外</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬卅日電〕官方頃宣佈，義大利新任內閣總理即基督敎民主黨領袖加斯貝里已於本日組成淸一色之基督敎民主黨內閣，僅延攬若干無黨派人物，以「專家」之資格參加新閣，於是加斯貝里使義國政　結束已獲得成功，外長一職仍由史福柴蟬聯。目下之新政府匪特使義國三黨聯合之局勢壽終正終寢，抑且亦使基督敎民主黨，社會黨與共產黨間之合作不能繼續。加斯貝里總理於本日午後七時卅分晋謁尼古拉總統，處出各部部長名單。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬卅日電〕政治觀察家頃談稱：義國社會共產兩黨被摒新內閣之門外，可能招致全國再度發生政治與社會騷動，極端左派之政黨正積極反對基督敎民主黨加斯貝里總理·共產黨業已宣佈將在各地舉行會議。</p>

<h3>匈京人心恐慌紛向銀行提款</h3>
<p>〔路透社維也納三十日電〕布達佩斯來電稱：匈牙利於發生戰爭結束以來最嚴重之政府危機後，匈京形勢恐慌，最間各銀行前均有長列存戶提取存款。據聞前被蘇軍逮捕之匈小地主黨秘書長柯伐克已供出總理那基國會議長伐爾迦外長蓋昂格奧西均曾參預叛國陰謀。蘇方於透露此一供辭後，遂引起政治危機之爆發。</p>
<p>法報評論</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎卅日電〕關於匈牙利政潮，頃據法政界人士加以評論稱：此乃由於莫斯科四國外長會議失敗所致。美國與蘇聯因彼此關係漸趨疏遠，故均竭力於秋季以前，在東歐及西歐鞏固其地位。匈牙利現已成爲政治手段之中心，蘇聯之行動乃在消滅現居多數之匈牙利小地主黨，以使共黨處於有利地位。</p>
<p>美英注視</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅一日電〕美國人士認爲年靑匈牙利民主之夭折，以及變成類似東歐蘇聯附　國之共產主義警察國，乃蘇聯陰謀政變之故，那基爲唯一最後反對共黨之領袖。外交界稱，實際上匈牙利已追隨保·波·羅·南·阿等國之後，投入蘇聯之懷抱。美國決策當局已取銷週末休假，額外工作，或將向蘇提出抗議，並催使聯合國進行調査，以及在共產握繼時停止對匈國加之經濟援助。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：英外部發言人聲稱：英政府認爲匈牙利國內長近發生之事件，顯示共黨確有刦奪政權之企圖。記者詢以匈牙利如成立共黨政權，英方是否予以承認，英發言人稱，此項問題正在考慮中。</p>

<h3>參會發表吿學生書懇切希望從速復課</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會大會昨日下午舉行第三次會議，討諭關於衛生。工務。公用等提案，同時由潘議長報告視察區政經過及各區布望改魯之意見。</p>
<p>關於疏導學潮一案，根據徐副議長等十七人所組織之特種委員會決議各點，經大會修正通過平息學潮所採取之行動決議三點，（見告學生書內）並發表告本市學生書如下：</p>
<p>學生諸君，本會第三次大會開幕的時候，你們正爲不滿現狀而罷課，爲罷課而受傷。你們道種自我犧牲的精神，我們都很感動。我們同時也想到，目前政風敗壞，經濟凋做，烽火連天，民不聊生，這種不合理的現象引起了你們的憂慮和忿怒，以致你們不能安心求學，這是政府當局和在野黨派所應共同負責的。但是你們要知道，目前許多政治問題，內的努力，不是一下子所能成功。所以你們固然應該起來喚起社會，注意這些問題，共同尋求解決的方案，但是不宜過分感情用事，徒求一時之痛快，意起更複雜的糾紛，甚或引起罷市罷工，以社會供犧牲。這種行為，即使動機十分純潔，也會失去大多數人的同情。你們祇要一看五月卅日報載北大清華敎授錢瑞升張奚若等一百零二人的告學生與政府書，就當明瞭大家都不贊成你們的做法。現在政府已經接受你們的要求，其一時不能解決的，也在考慮切實可行的辦法；你們極應適可而止，即日自動復課，努力學業，靜候時局的好轉，我們相信時局是一定會好轉的。假使你們還是繼續罷課，甚至要在六月二日大規模出動，則在社會要求安定的時候，在政府取締遊行的時候，在不逞之徒要乘機搗亂的時候，你們一定會失去社會的同情，减低你們自身的聲譽，甚至會不幸而演成流血的慘劇。這些都不是危言　聽，務請你們切實主意。</p>
<h3>三項決議</h3>
<p>對於吳市長宣司令五月卅目所宣布關於平息學潮所採取之行動，本會爲愛護靑年計，業經鄭重決議如次：</p>
<p>（一）通知政府切勿株連，並停止一切不必要之敎動措施，切實保護學生之安全。（二）被捕學生之情節較輕者，應請政府從速責付其學校或家長保外管敎，其情節較重者，在學潮未平息前，如有看管偵查之必要，應請仍本國家愛護靑年之旨予以優待，不加苛責，將來學潮平息之後，仍應實付其學校或家長管敎，不宜送往中共地區。（三）因此次學潮被捕之其他靑年，應請政府參酌上開意旨，同樣辦理。現在我們代表全市善良的市民，代表愛議你們的家長，十分懇切的要求你們從速復課，切勿再事遊行示威，免得增添紛擾的因素，加深本市的苦難，觸發潛伏的危機。掬誠相告，務重三思，上海市參議會。</p>
<h3>參議員赴交大視察　各敎授接受勸吿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參會疏導學潮特種委員會參議員趙君豪·李開第，偕同交大老同學工務局長趙祖康，於昨晨九時前往交大視察最近情形，並商請該校敎授顧念學生曠課已久，社會屬望殷切，早日恢復授課。　趙局長及兩參議員到校後，會往訪吳保豐校長，對吳校長提出辭職一點，再三予以挽留。繼即與敎授會主席裘院長維裕，管理學院院長兼訓導長鍾偉成，敎授鍾兆琳第十餘人晤面，致股切慰問。各敎授表示此次事件發生殊屬不幸，連日所受刺激尤深，自慚敎導無方，故敎授會議有罷敎之動談，兩參議員及趙局長對敎授苦衷，或表示深切同情，但仍請求彼等向敎授會議動議關於罷敎事「不必實行」，並「重予考慮」。當蒙在塲敎授接受。惟敎授對於市府方面亦提出要求四點：（一）對毆打學生之兇手，必須懲辦。（二）賠償受傷學生醫藥費。（三）賠償校內因此次事件而所受破壞損失。（四）保證以後不再發生類似情形。當由代表等答覆，決請議長轉達市長。</p>
<p>參議員退出交大後，旋即回市參議會，在該委員會第三次會議席上報告上述各點，同時並稱，提據視察所得，交大學生三分之一均已離校。並據在塲敎授證明政府所欲逮捕之學生，皆已不在校內。渠等並謂六月二日交大學生絕不致參加遊行，現學校需要安定，故請轉達市府當局，勿再派員來校加以刺激。</p>
<h3>私立八大學當局謁晤吳市長商談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立八大學校長及代表之江愼徵之（代敎長），震且胡文耀，光華朱經農，大同胡敦復，滬江林立（敎長），大夏歐元懷，聖約翰涂羽卿，東吳周承恩（秘書長），於昨日下午六時往市參議會訪謁吳市長（時市長正出席參議會大會），商談關於處理私校罷課事件。結果頗爲圓滿。市長並表示對被捕學生均予優待，調查確無越軌行動者，決予釋放。</p>
<h3>市長議長舉行茶會　招待交大各敎授　對學潮懇談結果融洽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長與潘議長於昨晚八時，在安福路市長官邸，聯合舉行茶會，招待交大各院院長曁敎授等約四十餘人，對此次交大學潮問題以及解決途徑，互相交換意見，到會者尚有市黨部方主任委員，交大校友工務局趙局長祖康，市參議會代表陶百川，李開第，趙君豪，立法委負孫九錄等。談話至深晚一時始散。</p>
<p>雙方叙談結果，對於此次事件均表示惋惜，但因互相以眞誠坦白之情緒交換意見，故政府當局以及在座之交大敎授校友等莫不感動異常，並獲得深切諒解。</p>
<p>席間敎授等對於昨日參議會決議各點，均認爲妥善。繼由吳市長表示，政府爲維持地方治安起具，不得不採取此種措置，希望學校當局能瞭解政府之苦衷。但渠允許交大方面除有共黨嫌疑之學生十八人（其中二人現在已捕）外，決不株連其他學生，同時尚未就逮之學生，以積決不赴校拘捕，事實上如學校復課，軍警自亦不再至校。</p>
<p>此時即有敎授聲稱，當局所欲逮捕之學生中，有數人平時功課優良，且即將畢業，可各請求市長本愛護靑年之旨從寬發落。市長當允可照參議會決議，視其情節較輕者，責付學校或家長保出管敎，其情節較重者，則於事畢後斟酌辦理。至於已經就逮之學生，當予以優待，可請校方及家長放心。</p>
<p>旋由潘議長表示，前日（卅日）因衝突而被毆受傷之學生，本人可請政府免費爲之悉心治療，至於懲兇問題，加果查實，當依法律途徑辦理，使大事化小事，小事化無事。</p>
<p>又會後瀋議長表示，今夜會談經過良好，一般看來六月二日交大學生將不致再參加遊行，三日當可復課。</p>
<p>交大敎授會決於今日上午十時在該校舉行會議在會談中曾請市長及議長出席，聞市長已決定派工務局長趙祖康，議長派參議員李開第代表參加。又交大敎授會並於今日下午三時，在國際飯店十四樓招待各報記者有所報告。</p>

<h3>戴懦林反訴永清理由不足判決駁回</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「伏波艦慘案」被告，招商局海閩輪船長戴儒林，被控過失殺人罪，刻正在地院審理，惟在審訊期間，戴儒林亦曾具狀反控海軍代總司令桂永清，應負過失碰撞責任，幷要求賠償損失。經地院汪偉成推事審核被告反訴理由，幷不充分，不能使桂永淸負刑事上之責任，遂判決駁回，其主文爲：「原告之訴駁回，訴訟費用由原告負担。」</p>
<h3>黨部方主委發表談話對學潮問題希望四點</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕市黨部方主委昨對學潮問題發表談話稱：最近政府逮捕中共非法份子，與學潮問題不能混爲一談。因自中共撤退後，其潛伏本市之地下工作人員，頗多混跡學校，本其「地下鬥爭縐領」，對社會秩序，肆意破壞，企圖造成社會之恐怖與混亂。政府爲安定地方，安定學校，對此輩搗亂份子，自應依法予以拘捕。至於此次學潮問題在五月初旬，原由各個學校內部問題而發生，嗣竟匯合演變爲整個政洽運動，其爲人操縱主使，已不難想見。本人從事學校行政曁敎育行政有年，願以敎育工作者之立塲，對平息此次學潮，向各方致其懇切之希望。（甲）校長方面：政府對此次各校首要搗亂份子之逮捕，正所以協助各校當局，力求安定，各校當局自應配合政府措施，速謀恢復常態，切不能消極，致增加問題之複雜性。（乙）敎授方面：對各被捕學生，縱以師生情感關係，不得不表示同情與關切，但不能只顧少數被捕學生，而抹然大多數希望安定復課之學生。似應盡力勸導學生，迅即復課，俾免萬千純潔好學之靑年，感受長期罷課之滿苦。（丙）學生方面：對此次學潮應澈底檢討，認淸中共之陰謀。現書羣之馬旣除，深望各校學生勿再予陰謀份子以可乘之機，造成長期紛亂，尤望即日復課，以求學校之安定。（丁）家長方面：盼能同情政府此次忍痛採取之嚴峻措施，訓勉子女，立即復課，努力學業。最後方氏謂，吾人目前所需要者爲安定，中共數月來所製造者爲混亂，爲恐怖。近彼又企圖於「六二」導演一幕「三罷一慘」之慘劇，凡屬市民，對此破製公共秩序之陰謀，應同具防制之實。明乎此，則對此次學潮，吾人亦應共同努力，迅謀平復，以達到安定上海之目的云。</p>
<h3>參議大會　討論提案　單人三輪車案保留　請政院核定統一經營市內電話機構擬准商民在適當地點建築火化塲所</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會大會，昨日討諭各項提案，對於公用方面，對「函請市府限期禁用單座三輸車或放寬尺寸以保乘客安」一案，討論頗爲熱烈，尤對於辦法中第一項「限於六月二十日前，單座三輸車，一律改爲雙座，或放寬合乎安全之標準尺度，否則即復原爲黃包車」一點，提出意見亦多，結果多數通過此案予以「保留」。蓋據龐京周稱：（一）單座改爲雙座後將更妨礙交通。（二）參議會旣決議改裝黃包車，現又欲將其復原，似非所宜。（三）改裝所耗費用何人負担，尚覺空洞。陳培德亦認爲妨礙交通者，非三輪車而乃大卡車。費樹聲同樣主張保留，並謂在一部份人民立塲上言，三輪車並不失爲交通生要工具，亦不妨礙交通，而機動車則常不按規則駕駛，肇事頗多。又關於「爲改進上海市內電話制度，擬請市府轉呈行政院從速核定統一經營上海市內電話，以利擴充，而應市民需要」案，通過擬請市府呈請行政院核定統一經營機構，並送請市府轉知公用局，飭電話公司特予注意改善。尚有其他公用案件，待明日會議繼續討諭。</p>
<h3>整飭里弄清潔</h3>
<p>關於衛生案件：經大會通過者有：（一）「爲改變土葬，仿照歐美各國，提倡火化案」，辦法：擬准商民在適當地點，建築火化塲所，配以電火，以求簡易。（二）「本市遍地垃圾，中外交責，爲防止掃垃圾夫虛額，應肌分區分保支配夫役，並獎勵創辦民營淸潔所，分區承包，淸除垃圾」案，經修正辦法通過。（三）「請整飭各里弄淸潔，並嚴厲取締住戶亂傾垃圾，以重衛生」案，辦法：請市警察局，對各里弄淸潔經常派員檢查，事先並在各里弄張貼佈告，不獨居民不得以糞便倒入箱內，即如隨處便溺，友垃圾傾倒箱外，亦均須嚴厲蔡止，並查明責任，對各該違章之住戶嚴厲執行科罰。（四）糞車妨碍衛生，請飭令衛生局轉知改善案。通過。（五）「擬鑄設南市臨時時疫個院，以利病衆而防傳染」案，辦法：一，請衛生局，盡力協助，會同地方商洽進行，並予撥助經費，二，如無院址則商請上海市立第二醫院，劃分一部，以作臨時院址，三，一切業務之辦理期間，以四個月爲度。</p>
<h3>開闢浦東公路</h3>
<p>工務方面：通過議案有：（一）「浦東出浦公路碼頭，應早計劃逐漸開闢，俾市建東部得與涌西平均發展」案，送請市府分別緩急先後，切實辦理。（二）臭溝浜臭氣劉人，數碍觀瞻與衛生，更危及婦孺生命，擬請政府限斯設法塡平，以震衆望。（三）請從速修築康樂路安庭路西藏北路等。（四）請市府俠照市政會議決案，促成滬西北翟路沿綫爲永久性設立工廠區域，並命令公佈。（五）請市府追加疏濬江灣走馬塘不數經費。</p>

<h3>小學生有非常抱負　飛美國　學航空　結伴七人貿然出走受人之愚幸經發覺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西藏南路值茂里恒茂小學學生唐志祥，十四歲，最近聞得途人謠傳，謂美國設有「中美幼年空軍學校」，現正招考等語，唐即信以爲眞，於是在學校大肆宣傳，當有同學陳貴榮（十四歲），夏震責（十六歲），高志强（十三歲），藍繼沛（十五歲），楊祥悔（十二歲），葛金凱（十三歲）等七各，一致表示同意。約定前日下午起行，擬往江覺飛機塲搭乘飛機赴美投考，不料行經虹口地方，天色已晏，七孩遂往虬江路借宿新中央旅社七號房間。至深夜時，適有義警到來檢查房間，突然發見此七孩形跡可疑，當即詢悉前情，始知受愚，於昨晨送至嵩山警局轉傳各該孩等之家長到案認領，惟據唐志祥稱：我姊現在大新公司充當女茶役，她爲識一個空軍，名呌張春明，我擬往江灣飛機塲，找他介紹往美國學習飛機師等語，其餘小孩均稱係受唐志祥之愚，未起行前，對於家長，均各隱匿不言云云。唐志祥於臨行時對其家長留有書信一封，信內路謂：「親愛的父母親…自從我和你在一起，已有十四年，你生我養我到大，也和我很好，我也不忘記你們父母之恩穗，我知國家現在很强，爲什麼我們不去為國家出點力，現在我聽得人家說，美國有自立空軍幼年學校，我也想去收點美國文字和英文，我望父母不必悲淚，我一到美國，即有電回國，請勿　念，祝體康健，兒志祥拜上」。</p>

<h3>議長綜合報吿視察區政經過　十二問題亟待解決提請大會商討參考</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會潘議長昨日在該會大會報告渠於五月二日至九日舉行區政座談會及十七日至二十五日視察區政經過，綜合本市應即解決之問題十二項，提供本次大會之商討與參考。議長報告及提供之意見，引起全體參議員然烈鼓掌，參議員等並提出向議長慰勞，同時對於報告書決議由市府施政報告書審查委員會合併審查。茲將議長提供各區所最迫切要求之十二問題，分誌於后；</p>
<p>（一）區民代表會曁各區區公所之職權及地位，應速予明白確定，以樹地方自治之基礎。區民代表會之職權，雖在市組織法上有明文規定，但因並無財政權，因此所有決議應興應革事項，無法付諸實踐。</p>
<p>確定區為法人</p>
<p>似應確定區爲法人，有其財政權，並賦予區民代表會以財政監督權。至區公所之職權地位可否請市政府俠照市組織法第三十四條之規定，將現行市府各局在各區之分支機構，一律歸納於區公所內，充實各區，亦希決定。其有關各局之業務，仍分別由各同處指揮監督。</p>
<p>撥給辦公房屋</p>
<p>（二）各區民代表會，區公所曁各保之辦公處所，應速爲解決。本人以爲在舊租界區內之警察分局，均係高樓大廈，同係本市公產，而又爲市府之一部份，可否設法重行調整。若警局房屋，能酌量騰出一小部份則十餘區區民代表會及區公所之辦公處所，即可解決。至若閘北南市及郊區等，則自應另行籌建。保辦公處，似可以三保至六保，租用民房，或撥甩公共房屋，成立保聯合辦公處，集中辦公，辦事人員亦可斯其簡化。</p>
<p>（三）劃界問題應速確定：本市大塲區，新涇區之諸翟鎭，龍華區之七寶莘莊等地，因轄區未定，行政紊亂，科紛時起。應速依照民國十六年原案，與江蘇省政府交涉確定。</p>
<p>籌劃貧民飲水</p>
<p>（四）貧民區之飲水，應速予解決：本市滬西及楊樹浦榆林區一帶，曁南市閘北浦東一帶之貧民棚戶區域，不獨無自來水可飲，抑且通江水均不易得，均向臭浜取水飲用。一旦時疫發生，勢必蔓延全市。應請市府速爲籌劃，安設自來水管，分設公共接水站，或鑿自流井施以消毒，任貧民取飲。</p>
<p>（五）各郊區之水電供應問題，及幹道路綫之確定問題，應速籌劃：本市中區人烟稠密，已不能容納，論者均謂應向郊區發展，惟發展郊區，必須先發展郊區之交通，道路及水電供應，使郊區交通便利，生活舒適，與市區不相上下，則人民自向郊區移居，無待驅策。</p>
<p>道路應速修築</p>
<p>（六）本市各區道路破壞不堪，應速修築：本市各區道路，經八年來之破壞，勝利以後，雖曾修補，但道路長達八百餘公里，而市庫支細，即重要幹道，亦苦無力完全修補，其他各區須要道路，簡直崎嶇不平，無法行走。應如何發動民力，協助修築。</p>
<p>（七）本市垃圾及糞便問題，應速謀解決方策：本市各區往往見到垃圾堆積，糞便滿地，臭氣四溢，蚊蠅媦集，實爲疫病之源，應謀迅速有效方法解決。</p>
<p>（八）違章建築及棚屋之搭造，應決定指導及取締辦法：本市各里街到處搭屋，公私空地，不問產權之誰屬，任意搭蓋房屋，不獨火災難防，抑且妨害交通，與塞塡下水通及河浜之疏導。應瞥促政府迅謀有效辦法，指定公有空地，指導貧民搭蓋棚屋，及取締妨害交通及公共排水之棚戶。</p>
<p>增加渡江輪渡</p>
<p>（九）浦西浦東應增加輸渡，改進交通：浦西至浦東交通，現僅恃輪渡為惟一交通工具，但僅有對江渡一處，似應在主要碼頭添設輸渡數處，兩岸對開，以便交通，而促進浦東繁榮。</p>
<p>（十）四機塲之佔地及中央各機關在滬接收敵偽强佔之民地民房民倉，應速淸理：機塲用地分別征用給價，其他民地民房民盒等應交涉發還，以維產權，而安民命。</p>
<p>（十一）郊區浮厝，應速淸除：各郊區浮厝滿地，貧民就浮厝旁搭屋，不獨有礙衛生，抑且傳染疫厲，應請政府速謀有效辦法淸除。</p>
<p>（十二）各區獻校校基應速設法撥給：本會於去歲主席蔣公六十華誕時，發起獻校祝壽，以期早日普及義務敎育，各區均各組織委員會，分別勸募，惟各區校基，至今未見劃撥，以致工作停滯，應請市政府速撥公地，充作校整，以竟事功。</p>
<h3>恨婦不歸醉漢放火　求死不顧公衆安全自言為了生無意味</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地檢處昨日下午初度偵查一離奇之「公共危險」罪，殊堪發噱。綠有黃　奇者，年約五十餘歲，在中央銀行充當信差，住迪化中路三〇二號。其姘婦開一梅記烟紙店，因在外有不貞行爲，黃甚爲償很。五月廿六日夜十一時許，黃酒醉返店，見姘婦仍未回來，頓萌自殺之念，遂以油紙碎布等物引火起燒，濃烟透於亭子問住戶喬汝嘉屋內。喬驚起呌醒樓上下房客黃士速等，將黃門打開，用水將火澆熄，幸未釀巨禍。喬等以黃因一人私憤，而影響公衆安全，引動公憤，遂扭控於警局，以「公共危險」罪轉解地檢處法辦。昨由郁　新檢察官傳問告訴人喬汝嘉·黃土連。朱伸千。馬紹寗。周大同·姚壽琪·陳志浩·徐匯川·金宗培·吉成安等。黃之姘婦未到庭。據被吿供稱：因姘婦時常外出不歸，憤恨已久，是夜又適逢酒醉，故起自殺之念。檢查官問何以自殺必須縱火，豈非影響其他人之安全。黃稱：因覺人世毫無意味，不如放一把火，同歸於盡。郁檢察官以本案尚須調查，改期再訊。</p>

<h3>南京學生組織聯合會　展開愛國護學運動　昨派代表來滬定今日招待記者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南京學生組織愛國護學學生聯合會，昨派代表十人來滬。該代表等為展開愛國護校運動，定於今日下午三時，在新生活俱樂部，招待記者，有所報吿。該會上國民政府書，說明南京中大等校同學，初爲要求政府增加公費，中途竟爲中共及民盟份子利用，政掀起暴動性之學潮，要求政府嚴伸法紀，安定人心，並電邀中共參政員立即來京，出席國民參政會，恢復和談。該會並有「上國民森政會畫」，「吿中國共產黨書」，「吿民衆同盟書」，囑望中共停止一切富於煽動性，破壞性的政爭方式，並望民盟眞正退出學校。</p>
<p>茲探誌該會宣言如次：</p>
<p>「我們再四考慮，在眞理面前已不容我們緘口無言；我們屛絕情　，而在正義的激勵下，更不得來吼出心的呼聲。目前的祖國，艱苦達於極點，人們從各個不同的立塲出發，從各個不同的利害觀點喊出自己的痛苦，辛酸的事實，擺在一顆顆鮮血滲透的良心前面求裁判，醜惡的罪行，又重重疊疊在侵蝕社會的靈魂，一激一盪，中華民族的國本在動搖了，但是誰在扶持這已經動搖的國本？誰在挽救這奔騰無方的狂瀾？看看戰後的世界各國，慘痛的戰爭敎訓，迫使每個國家的國民，，强化其國家的意識，每個國家的國民都犧牲了自己的成見和偏私，而在國家的範圍內謀求公衆的幸福，但是，再看看我們的國家，人民到處流離，社會到處動亂，物價的高漲，內戰的慘痛重重地壓着每個人的心。近日的學潮，無疑的便是部份同學對目前現狀要求正當改革，同時，也不必諱言，有人在藉機煽動，企求製造社會混亂，促使政府崩潰，但正當改革必於安定條件下求進步，而製造混亂，顚覆政府的企圖，實在是傾覆國家，毁滅社會的陰謀了。而且在國家今日艱苦的局面下，合理要求，不必盡　罷課遊行？我等不忍使學業日益荒棄，更不忍使動亂之形態，日益擴張，我們同學組成愛國護學學生聯合會，本愛國護學的宗旨，愷切呼籲，幷決以行動貫澈吾人之宗旨，茲提出吾人之主張如次：（一）看現在的學潮實况，好像學生和政府是站在對立的立塲，這種觀念必須即時糾正。我們以爲學生的合理要求，政府應當善爲採納，學生的過分要求，政府應善爲開導，學生自身，應識大體，顧大局，以學業爲本，以自愛爲尙。（二）一切黨派不要再利用學生作爲政爭的工具；同時學生也要遵從理智，明辨是非，以免爲野心家暗中遝用。（三）共產黨要給國家以休養生息的機會，放棄以武力爭取政權的企圖，其他各黨派也要摒棄成見，共謀國是。（四）社會各界人士要痛體時艱，勿使社會動亂，以致動搖國本，同時更要激發公正輿論，在實現政治民主的進程中保持國家的安寗。（五）趁國際局勢尙容中國從事建設的時候，全國人士應指摘任何破壞行爲，並發動全民力量積極建設國家。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於證券交易所經紀人保證金改用美金債券繳納一案，財經兩部新批示，業已頒發（見昨日本報）規定經紀人保證金代用品部份，其改繳之美金債券，限於本年五月底前，一律按票面七折照繳完竣。至遞交交易本證據金代用品，亦應同樣辦理，惟在美金廣券尙待洽購以前，得暫以現金繳納抵充，仍限於六月十五日以前，洽購完妥。其尙待洽購者，六月一日起，應以現金抵充。並以關於保證金代用品部份五月底認購期限，因經紀人已不及辦理，已准財經兩部駐證交監理員辦公處，展限至本年六月四日辦竣。至關於遞交交易展期一案，證交亦接奉部示准自文到之日起（即五月卅日）再展期一個月云。</p>
<h3>經紀人公會理事　今日訪問王志莘</h3>
<p>證交經紀人公會方面，於昨日下午五時許，始接奉證交關於此事之正式公事。該會若干常務理事，曾即舉行談話會，並擬於今日下午，往訪證交總經理王志莘，有所洽商。聞經紀人方面之意見，認爲：（一）此次新部示，對股市前途，不致發生重大影響。蓋各經紀人已有準備，不如上次部令突頒時之倉卒。（二）遞交交易額，或將因此而减少。故美金債券，在遞交本證據金代用品部份，恐乏消化力。該方面並表示，不如早日結束遞交交易，俾减少空方之壓力云。</p>
<h3>市塲人氣渙散　空頭心思活躍</h3>
<p>華股昨又遭特殊打擊，所方雖未明白表示美債證金之公示已到，但人心鑒於連日之流言，業已獲一部份設實，咸感缺乏興趣。陣容渙散，再吿慘瀉。惟乘低空方續補，屢有回漲，形勢極爲飄忽。晨開人心惶惶，開低甚多。遞永紗且迫近跌停限度，開後一二九號力購，一七一號二一九號及散戶亦納，遞永紗即自跌停板立吿回升至七二〇〇元外。二三五號一三七號九四號趁高了結，退爲七〇五〇元，一五二號二一八號一五七號一〇二號四五狄一一七號二二四號一一九號一五三號一五五號三六號三二號二二號俱進，港申電報縮至十三元半，遞永紗急切回漲到七五五〇元。新光在一五二號力購之下，亦吿急升，八五號九四號八三號一九九號八九號一九七號六三號一五四號一九〇號連袂脫售，十一時後逐漸盤低至七二五〇元以內。一六〇號一〇五號一八〇號一六四號一九六號一〇九號趁低進至七四五〇元以上，一四一號一四八號六五號一四二號八九號一一二號三二號咸加了結，曾回跌至七〇五〇元。一六號五四號一〇六號一二九號二一九號二三號買意忽盛，新亞宣吿漲停，有增資消息，激勵買氣也。加之平行綫本票之說又起，午收升爲七二四〇元。收後一三號二二四號三五號俱進，喊價升至七三〇〇元外。結果較前收計永紗華豐勤興中法新華各跌半成左右。信和永公跌一成，新光景福微升，榮豐中紡統益內衣跌半成强，國貨跌一成，中絲漲一成，新亞獨吿漲停，餘股升降俱微。遞交計永紗華豐永公景福勤興各跌半成强，信和跌一成，新光微升。塲外各老股華商南洋及大生三廠平疲，餘均微漲。</p>
<h3>統債回低外股仍漲</h3>
<p>公債昨稍回低，高價難於持久。統丙晨開一七〇〇〇元，低價一四七〇〇元，而後稍穩。三六〇室五三三室有納，寳隆及散戶則出。成交約六七百萬。結果較前收計各債均吿徵降。</p>
<p>外股昨證券帮仍納怡紗會德豐，廣帮則進英聯，散戶有售，怡紗不過盤局，漲勢不逮英聯遠甚。怡紗晨開七五〇〇〇元，高價七九〇〇〇元近午在七七〇〇〇元左右盤旋，結果較前收計英聯獨漲一成，會德　業廣紙業航業鋼業各升半成，怡紗墾植雖漲而不多。</p>
<h3>內匯匯率明日調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四行兩局一庫之內匯率，自本月二日起，又將調整。茲將調整各區之匯率，分誌如次：</p>
<p>厦門每千元收八〇元（原七〇元），福州六五元（原六〇元），長沙衡陽均三〇元（原四〇元），湖南其他各區四〇元（原五〇元），河南區四〇元（原五〇元），蚌埠一五元（原一〇元），漢口武昌均二〇元（原三〇元），沙市宜昌均四〇元（原五〇元），湖北其他各區均四〇元（原五〇元），靑島五元（原二元），雲南三〇元（原二五元），陝西一五元（原二〇元），至廣州仍爲五元，汕頭及廣東其他各區均仍爲九五元，重慶仍爲十元。</p>
<p>惟商業銀行之內匯率，日來已見挫跌。以昨日行市言，重慶自五元至卅元。漢口自一五元至四〇元。西安自一〇元至二〇元。長沙自一〇元至四〇元。昆明自二五元至五〇元。若干較低之匯率，已反較國家行局爲廉云。</p>

<h3>洋荘茶市疲弱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來華茶外銷，愈趨愈僵。茲據該業中人吿記者：目前國外茶價頻頻降落，且聞埃及等地，刻下除存有紅茶一千五百餘噸外，復向錫關以較廉之價格，再訂購三千噸。因此彼地茶業存底旣豐，售價益形低賤。而我國茶葉生產成本，則在百物翱翔中，仍跟蹤陡增。綜觀此種情形，華茶出口焉能順利。昨日洋莊茶市，吐納談判之結果，依然僵持，致交易疲莫能興。全市祗僅怡和洋行向華成茶葉公司購進去年度婺源大帮約二百箱左右，價　担以五十六萬元做開。市氣雖未下跌，但咸帶軟化。他若各種內銷茶，去化尙有，而市勢則因供給亦可，乃續趨平定，行情多與隔日相仿。</p>
<h3>肥皂火柴續漲</h3>
<p>昨日用品市面固本及箭刀兩牌肥皂因去化尙佳，每箱續漲四千元。固本皂每箱價三十八萬四千元，箭刀皂卅七萬六千元。黄祥茂平穩，白祥茂小二千元。亨利日月牛牌鼎蜂市亦堅挺。火柴美　價爲二百六十三萬元，比上日升五萬元。鳳風二百六十二萬，亦漲二萬元。新牌貨市亦帶俏。</p>
<h3>捲菸後市轉秀</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况晨開似轉平疲，十支大英烟自七百四十六萬步降至四十萬元間徘徊，午後形勢好轉，最後回升至七百五十萬元，比上日又漲五萬元。老刀六百五十萬元，亦續昂二萬五千元。其餘華商烟則漲跌互見。</p>
<h3>台灣燒碱運滬</h3>
<p>台灣碱業公司，爲資源委員會及台灣省政府所合辦。該公司所產燒碱鹽酸等，除供應台省外，運滬配售。聞最近有固碱二百餘噸，分批運抵上海。該批燒碱，除大部份配售中紡公司外，一般民營工業廠商，均得事受配售權利。並聞該公司駐滬人員稱，此後該公司所屬各廠，逐漸增產，將源源運滬，今後滬市燒碱，當不虞匱乏。</p>
<h3>食米交易閑散　市價起伏狹隘　四聯允貸粉廠一七六〇億元</h3>
<p>米市起伏狄隘，昨（卅一日）南北米市場做開依然閑散，但受各物上漲影響，人心恍惚，執貨者竟將市價喊高，市勢由疲轉堅。北市塲白粳曁早薄稻略被做高，其餘秈米白元跌平互見，南市塲堅多跌少，惟碾秈跌勢仍勁，降至二萬元。昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千八百餘石，車站卸貨尙不在內，須於星期一登記。</p>
<p>麪粉新貨已近，配粉實行，消化益懈，步跌三五千元，洋粉亦跌二三千元。麩皮直綫下游，續挫二三千元。豆餅鄕消有動，挺升三五千元。黄豆油廠進取，消胃活絡，轉漲六七千元至萬元，油市光堅後平，蔴油見升萬元，淸油豆油均無出入，菜油帶挺，生油堅定之狀，波動尙微。</p>
<p>菉豆去化仍呆，赤豆問津者少，回挫四五千元。芝蔴南洋進胃蟬聯按步挺進，再高萬元，生仁廣帮納胃仍殷，逐步高翔，再加萬元。紅糧續疲一二千元，苞米少神，生仁菉豆近日四川均見報抵，漢口新蠶樣品已到。</p>
<p>第四區麪粉工業同業公會，爲新麥登塲，缺乏資金，於上週間特呈文四聯總處，請准予發放麥貸，並提供原則五項。四聯總處對該會所提貸款一項，以日產千包之廠貸予十八億元者，核减至十億元，餘類推。該會以蘇浙皖三省，爲根據請求貸款三二〇〇億，如照四聯所定則實得約爲一七六〇億元，利率爲四分。</p>
<p>另悉：糧食部對本年全國粉麥擬有產銷計劃，將於本月初旬公佈，將來對各麪粉廠業務，將以四聯總處之貸款換取各廠之製成品，酌加合法利益。在廠商資金無多，端賴當局貸款之情形下，此項代製性質之條文，雖使各廠絕無欣欣向榮之希望，旦處於目前環境困難，仍擬加以接受。貸款發放日期，將在本月中旬，全部細則四聯總處定下週內通知該業。</p>
<h3>皖省撤銷運米禁令</h3>
<p>糧政當局息二安徽省政府已正式撤銷米糧禁運令，自即日起不再限制食米出境，惟以江浙兩省爲限。現蕪湖蚌埠等產米區食米，接濟本市民食除陸路由江南鐵路由蕪轉京，由火車運滬外，水路方面則由國營招商局民生等江輪擔任運輸工作。據悉招商局已有延閩海宇兩輪，裝載蕪米三千包來滬。</p>

<p>中國造船工程學會，自理事長李允成氏主持以來，會務推進不遺餘力。現爲討論重要會務，修改章程，改選理監事，已決定於六月一日上午九時半在高禺廟海軍江南造船所召開本年度會員大會。除討論議案外，並將宣讀重要論文。聞該會今後會務計劃，將側重實際工作。如促進玫府利用日本賠償物資，在滬籌設大規模之船舶試騐所，以爲改進我國船舶之硏究中心機構，現已派定專家多人正在詳擬計擬中。至我國今後航業政策，該會亦對政府有所建議，最近並呈請交通部推薦專家代表我國參加英國即將召開之國際海上生命安全公約會議，俾對戰後海上安全問題提供具體意見，有所改進云。</p>

<h3>銀樓業處境困難　方天寶宣吿停業　銀樓業昨向市長請求救濟</h3>
<p>本市銀樓業，自中央頒佈經濟緊急措施停配黄金後，該業曾數度請願，結果未甚圓滿，京市銀樓已多數自動結束。此風已開始蔓延及於滬埠，據記者探悉，本市銀樓大同行南京路方天寳，昨日已由股東會宣佈，六月一日起停業，職員每人發給遣散費一百萬元，惟職工表示反對，爭持解散費每人爲八百萬元，因勞資爭持點相距甚遠，昨日澈宵尙在談判中。今日開業否未定。該樓甫於去年開張，營業尙佳，第自黄金停配後，因主要營業停阻，而開支浩大，遂出結束之途，聞舊歷端節期間，尙有大批銀樓收歇云。</p>
<p>本市銀樓業代表姚桂卿等四人，昨日上午十時半前往市府謁見吳市長，對於該業目前處境困難情形，有所報吿。並以該業無形停頓已久，職工薪金等開支浩大，實難長此維持，請求救濟云。</p>
<h3>生海指數解凍後　綢貨市價銳漲　廠經堅俏人絲漲勢緩和</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲漲勢已趨緩和，一二〇號高山有光上午二千〇十萬至二十萬元有成交，最小喊過一千九百八十萬元。旋因進意頗濃，終升至三十萬元收盤，與上日價軋平，下午喊過一價二千〇五十萬元，其他各牌貨均無甚上落　昨市廠經市况仍堅，持貨者類皆不肯脫手，以致喊價又向上升。A字等級討價在二千八百萬元左右，C字等級喊價二千七百萬元，俱因週末適逢月底，銀根不免擠軋，以是無人過問而乏成交。干經亦無交易，各級喊價均較上日喊價大一百萬元之左。昨中蠶公司有二十包絲開出，D字等級，價作二千五百萬元，與上日喊價相仿。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨銳漲，因生活指數宣佈解凍後，工價激增，成本遞加，業內外人均有進意，故造成激昂局面。美亞被面喊達一千萬元，大誠被面喊九百七十萬元，惟塲內皆乏成交。格子璧縐最大做三萬六千二百元，後因買戶觀望不納，回小二百元，最後喊五千九百元賣出。週一期喊六千三百元，未曾做開。盛杭等貨，產地亦均報漲，人絲華錦縐上午討價二萬元，無光紡及條子紡等，英不漲起百分之十左右，不過喊價過高，正式交易，極為稀少。</p>
<h3>紗布廣續上揚</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因工人生活指數增高，廠家日後產紗成本勢必激昂，市塲人心遂趨堅挺。本街實需活躍，新買參加，致行情逐步盤升。二十支特雙馬價爲八百六十五萬元，雙馬七百八十五萬，均創空前高峯。惟四二支細紗走勢較滯，藍鳳紗此上日軋升四十五萬，爲一千三百六十五萬元。廿支及十六支紗俱昂三五十萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布初開一度趨軟，蓋以週末，又屆月底，浮戶頗多吐售，兼逢紡建開售，籌碼充沛。十二磅龍頭細布低價見卅二萬五千元，旋爲業中見低吸收，本客實需復殷，價又盤升。迨至最後龍頭細布回高至卅三萬七千元，五福細布爲卅二萬元，比上日續升自七千元至一萬元，彩球藍鷄玉龍及ABC等細布，價亦挺升自五千元至一萬元左右。漂布當銷，軋升一二萬元，其餘粗在元布藍布及士林布等，價一致上揚三五千元至二三萬元下一。</p>

<h3>贛省參議會　第十次會議　側影　十八位參議員口頭連續質詢連珠砲似的沒有一分鐘間歇</h3>
<p>— 南昌廿四日航訊　潛明</p>
<p>五月廿一日贛省參議會舉行第十次會議，由民政廳廳長李中襄作施政報吿。報吿畢，參議員陶漢等十餘人，紛紛作口頭質詢，情勢之熟烈緊張，爲歷屆會議所未見。李氏離席後，參議員陶漢等十一人，即臨時動議，以李廳長有失職嫌疑，應函請省政府，並呈請行政院予以査辦，以時間短促，草率通過，茲特將會議前後詳情報道如下：</p>
<p>議塲上　空氣驟緊</p>
<p>雖說是初夏，但這天（廿一日）天氣却悶熱得超過三伏，上午，省參議會會議塲里已坐滿了七八十位參議員，來賓和記者，空氣顯得更加悶熱，而在這悶熱的氣氛中，有十多位參議員臉上的表情，却異常的緊張，這對於敏感的記者羣却似乎得到了一種預感，這一次的會議，顯得有點不很平淡吧？說不定有精彩塲面吧？大家正以緊張的心情迎接那即將來臨的塲面！</p>
<p>九時廿分，李廳長被邀入報吿席，作施政報吿。他扼要的把民政部門一般業務，各方面作了一個概括的叙述，似乎有意要多空出一些時間，聽候參議員的質詢。</p>
<p>報吿畢，參議員多人起立發言，空氣突然緊張，首先提出質詢的，是進賢籍的參議員陶漢。他說李廳長有樹立派系的企圖，列舉的理由是：近月來廳長出巡使有佈置選舉的意思，其次，他說本月進賢縣政府舉辦的鄉鎭長考試，也與未來的選舉有關。第三，他說他的同鄉胡毅（他的政敵）搭廳長的車子返縣，也是違法的。當他說到胡毅這個名字，頗有深惡痛絕的樣子。最後他特別加以說明，他與廳長有三十年的交情，但因私不廢公，所以特別忠吿。說到這里，他的表情倒頗有一點大義滅親的氣槪。接着陶漢發言的是杜隆元，袁日省，黄裳元，胡定國，等參議員，杜參議員質詢的是貪汚的朱文華爲什麽由萬安調升遂川。袁參議員質問，縣長交替爲何科長秘書亦隨之更動？黄參議員說，安義縣爲什麽要用一個年將七十的做參議會秘書？胡參議員說新喩縣縣長沒有政治頭腦。此後彭學湛，劉光漢，林撫民，黄　芳，熊在墀，劉任秋，徐俠成，塗岡，晏繼志等參議員繼起發言，彭參議員對縣長資歷及未來選舉提出意見，黄參議員除對鄕鎭造產鄕鎭長任期及戶政有所建議外，他特別提出一個疑問說，李廳長以中委身分來屈就廳長，據傳聞是來佈置選舉的。熊參議員發言希望李廳長以公正立塲來造福江西，徐參議員則以惑慨系之的口吻說，李廳長現在已有「衆叛親離」的現象。</p>
<p>十八人　開連珠砲</p>
<p>在十八位參議員此伏彼起的質詢中，李廳長站在報吿席上，始終是傾神的聽着，他不時發出微笑。尤其是當他聽到「胡毅搭他的車子是違法的」，「爲什麽要年將七十的人做縣參議會秘書」，「以中委身分屈就廳長」這些話的時候。十八人連續的口頭質詢連珠砲似的，沒有一分鐘的間歇。李廳長對各質詢開始答辯，在他作施政報吿的時候，已費去了一部的時間，而十八位參議員連續的口頭質詢又佔據了幾乎規定時間，所以他在答辯的時候，只好扼要的擊一說了。但剛要談到選舉問題時，主席即按鈴催促，後來雖然延是五分鐘，而對問題的答辯，依然不能暢所欲言，首先他說：「縣長考績，是各廳處共同評定的，當然包括敎育·建設等項在裏面。至於最近出巡的事，是遵照內政部規定，每季都要出巡。至於鄕鎭造產，早已注意防止攤派。」正說到這裏，主席王副議長說：「不必一一答覆，請作一槪括的總答覆。」於是李廳長接着關於選舉的事，他說，「剛才各位的傳說完全是無稽的，現在一切選舉的法規，中央還沒有頒發，甚至連主辦選舉的機構也沒有明白的指示，怎麼能談到操縱的事情？」當李廳長正要繼續說下去時候，參議員丁砥南突然把桌子一拍，大聲疾呼的說：「中正大學進行請願的學生，已經衝過中正橋了，打死了人，我們還聽什麽民政質詢的答辯？我們要討論緊急措置，請民政廳改用書面報吿。」主席王副議長有關也一疊聲連的呌：「改用書面報吿，改用書面報吿！」李廳長說，「好吧，我用書面報吿，但各位不要說有問題不當面答覆。」於是便退席，向大門外走去。</p>
<p>變戲法　通做議案</p>
<p>突然有人大呌「關門！」一部參議員不曉得什麽事情，馬上退席，議塲的大門隨即合攏。主席並命令警士站在門內，掏出一張有字的紙，兩手不停的發抖，顫着聲音說：「今有一個緊急提議，是關於中正大學學生遊行請願的事。」大家都靜靜的聽着，可是王副議長顫巍巍的唸的却是：「査民政廳長李中襄，自到職以來，利用職權，樹立派系，企圖操縱選舉，製造地方糾紛，便利私圖，並排除異己，包庇貪汚，種種違法失職行爲，經本日各參議員列舉事實，當面贊詢，似此劣蹟昭著，實屬有忝厥職，應函請省政府併呈請行政院，嚴予査辦，以儆官邪，面肅政風，是否有當敬請公決！」提案人陶漢，楊溯傳，劉！棟，李中定，徐俠成。林德民，胡定　，曾昭昌，劃任秋，熊在墀，楊蔭光。</p>
<p>這時參議員座位上忽然有五六個人大嚷，無異議通過。大門這時已開了，大家都紛紛出去。這「以儆官邪而肅政風」的議案，便算是通過了。這消息馬上傳遍了南昌市，記者爲明瞭事實眞象起見，會造訪省參議員多人，他們吿訴我，有許多參議員對本案如此變戲法似的提出和通過，深爲不滿，已發起簽名請求提出覆　。當晚又訪問廳長李中襄，探詢他對省參議會通過的議案的態度</p>
<p>李廳長　口吻幽默　李廳長對其退席後會議情形及議案拒不作答，他說，「我沒有什麽說的，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，一切聽諸中央及輿論好了。」談到質詢時的情形，便引起了他的話頭。他說：我做過八年的國民參政員，我也曾出席過無數會議，可沒有碰到今天的情形。一連串十八個口顯的質詢毫無間隔的發問，而答覆時間又是那樣短促，再不能讓我說話。……說到那些質詢，有些是很好的，但是有些是很抽象到極點的，呌我怎樣去答辯。至於說我企圖操縱選舉，這是從那裏說起，怎樣選舉，還不曉得那能說到「企圖操縱」，企圖雨個字是怎樣抽象的字眼呵！」最後，他以幽默的口吻說，你想一想，一個朋友搭我的汽車也算違法，我出巡各縣也是運法，安義縣用七十多歲的人做參議會秘書，也要不得，何况參議會秘書是由縣長呈荐的，你想想！還有一位先生說我，「衆　親離」，我可不明白那「衆」與「親」何所指？何謂親？何謂衆？我心目中只有江西的老百姓，我去年回省，原是決心服務案梓，替老百姓辦事的」，說到這裏，他的態度與語氣，顯得非常的沈重而嚴肅的。</p>

<h3>蘇北綏靖形勢</h3>
<p>— 如二十四日訊　本報通訊員王寒鷗</p>
<p>一個月前，蘇北的消息非常不好，尤其京滬謠諑紛傳，甚至謂興化鹽阜等縣城均吿不守；沒有多天，謠言不攻自破了，除了演海區鄉鎮曾被殘共騷擾外，興化盥阜失守等消息，根本沒有這回事。蘇北鄰近京滬，它的安危是江南朋友所特別關心的，用特報道如次：</p>
<p>青紗帳撤　殘共竄勢减殺</p>
<p>蘇北底情形，像是生了疥療那樣滿身長了疙瘩，到處鄕村有殘共竄擾，城市有造作謠言的「地下鬥爭者」，流來竄去，擾害得蘇北人民不能獲致安定生活。然而殘共的破壞式活動，祇能像疥瘡那樣地作獲，够不上火辣辣地作痛，因爲目前它想和國軍爭城奪池的力量，一時好像選沒有；當前的事實，除東台大中集不幸遭其踞擾外，其餘李堡掘港等戰役，殘共都被國軍打得落花流水。最近共方似在保持實力，臨時改變了竄擾計劃，各地城鎭，已經多天不聞「警報」。麥收開始，靑紗帳即將全部撤除，濱海共軍「大反攻」的機會，已經在無形中失去了！</p>
<p>自衛力薄　人民切盼增兵</p>
<p>蘇北國軍兵力不多，不能在處城市鄕村駐遍；自衛隊作戰力量又差，不敢在鄕村單獨駐守；淸剿的工作做不好，却讓殘共在鄕村裏殺人放火，製造恐怖，打擊農民情緒，阻撓綏靖政治的向前推進。最近鄕村許多良善晨民，因畏懼殘共幹部手段酷虐，恐遭不測，又多紛紛放棄田舍，向外逃亡。無疑地，今年蘇北農民生產力一定還要較從前幾年大大减少，這成爲蘇北前途的隱憂。當地人民的意見：政府一天不增强淸剿力量，打定推進綏政的基礎，蘇北人民一天得不到安定生活。</p>
<p>司令出巡　指示　靖軍事</p>
<p>第一綏靖區李司令長官，前天赴如皋泰興各縣視察，對於各地綏靖軍事，有所部署與指示。一般預料：各地方三麥登塲了，國軍爲了安定蘇北人民底生活，必將出動保護農民麥收與秧忙，殘共也一定要來搶收「公糧」雙方免不了有幾番激烈的戰鬥。記者訪問駐軍王副師長克俊，承他見示蘇北綏靖形勢極詳。王副師長甚健談，有儒將風味，他每天必讀「申報」和各地地方報紙，對於新聞理論頗有見解。他說：「最近搜到共方的報紙，上面雖然完全是許多歪曲的宣停，但是記述通俗生動，而且描寫像眞，呌人容易以假作眞，上他的當；我方報紙雖然報道眞確，有時恐怕還沒有它能起作用」！記者說：「本報的綜合通訊版，就是朝生動引人閱讀這方面做去的」。他說：「我看到，內容很不錯」！</p>
<p>土地政策　各縣開始實行</p>
<p>因爲殘共不斷在鄕間肆擾，改善蘇北農民生活的土地政策，沒有能按預定計劃澈底實施。南通·泰縣·如昆等縣政府，現在已組織成立地權淸理委員會，調解委員會，製定整理地藉辦法，舉辦土地登記，實行「三一减租」。但是因爲鄉區殘共不肅淸，行政不得貫澈當地，所以大都先自政府控制的地區，分段試辦，以觀成效。此外，鄕鎭人民負擔奇重，地方攤派頻繁，是綏靖區人民最大的一宗苦痛；各地縣政府現正擬定統籌統支的辦法，着手撤併駢枝機關，减少攤派，蘇北已有幾縣辦理獲効。如皋縣政府前天召開縣政會議，首先一個問題，就是籌謀統籌統支减輕人民負擔的辦法。</p>

<h3>南市救火龍頭待修</h3>
<p>編輯先生：南市蓬萊路底，有一救火水喉，因年久失修，早已損毁，以致每日流水，街道浸濕，行人不便，且附近居民携具取水者衆多，時有爭吵打架等情發生，希主管當局早派員修理是幸。（蓬萊路市民孫志廷）</p>
<h3>龐炳勳息影隴海園</h3>
<p>— 鄭州廿五日航訊本報記者范世勤</p>
<p>龐炳勳雖然還沒有顯出龍鍾老態的樣子，可是他的一種耳重語絮的神態，却已有些衰老了。他在當代的人物中，已是像他衰老殘年一樣；把他作爲今日的新聞人物，正是把一束褪色的花揷在花瓶裏似的。然而他今日對於豫北的關係，還是使人重視。陸軍總司令顧墨三先生就相當的重視他，在這次新鄕緊張的時候，就派人把他接到鄭州隴海園來憇息。</p>
<p>豫省人民，尤其今日豫北人民，對他很容易想到的不是因爲他在河南多年，是因爲他的舊部現在還是被圍在安陽，在作孤軍奮鬥中；而且他的二兒淸振還剛帶着一團人馬飛到安陽去增援。和他談起守安陽的他的舊部，他會和你嚅嚅不息地詳談。說這個四十師師長李振淸民九年起就跟在他的身邊，廿二三年如何在豫北肅淸土匪；抗戰中如何在臨沂一帶打垮坂垣第五師團，開抗戰勝利之先聲；如何在長垣載役中殲滅敵人一個旅以及朱仙鎭，太行山之役的情形；卅三年如何在洛陽一帶掩護蔣鼎文司令長官安全撤退。如老媼談家事，頗够味道。</p>
<p>李師長是山東人，個子却是不大，可是一臉粗黑緊肌，倒頗與其李鐵頭雅號相稱，記者在安陽見過他一面，一見而知爲善戰的悍將。他的帶兵的辦法，還是保持馮玉老的作風。一個新兵，第一天要先認識三個字，三個月內要認識一百個字，半年就得要會寫家信，一年就得要會記日記。他自己在博愛還拜了一位杜翰林當老師，經常也有幾個博學之士在教他書。「不聞槍聲便是讀書聲，」這是他的部隊裏足以驕傲於人的口號。卅年卅一年，這個部隊出過大風頭，是被檢閱團認爲全國第一等的部隊。那時候，連湯恩伯的部隊都曾經組織過參觀團，足足在這那個部隊裏觀習一個多月。他的大兵玩的兩套，把一些參觀團弄得驚服不置。一套就是飛簷走壁上天樓；一套就是槍射遠壕流動把。那個部隊至今還是不忘馮玉老的老調：『在家爲良民，在軍爲良兵；』『提倡舊道德，灌輸新智識。』所以龐炳勳總是老眼笑瞇瞇地說：『我的一官一兵，沒有當共產黨的。』</p>
<p>李師長孤守安陽，與劉伯誠六萬之衆，血戰已經二十餘天，還是屹然不動，而且已經把劉伯誠三週內決取安陽的大牛皮拆破，眞不是偶然的。</p>
<p>龐炳勳論過他的部下以後，又論到他的友人孫殿英。關於劉伯誠在攻犯湯陰受挫之際，詐退數十里，而孫不以爲計，襯城內人民出入，以致被共黨混入其內，破壞了磨電機，電網失效，而吿城陷，頗爲惋惜。</p>
<p>鄭州滿天風沙，獨隴海園賴有葱綠大樹，尙稱僻靜的一角，龐每日讀報作書其間，堪也得其恬靜之所。他已不是今日的新開人物，而所談又是平凡，沒有像今日唱和平的人受人愛聽，然而他的舊部正守着晋冀魯豫邊區的一個重點中，與他每日函電交馳，這，使他在今日的史料中，還是可以提供一段補注。</p>

<h3>文藝復興與社會改造</h3>
<p>— 顧一樵博士講　沈澄如　陳永林記</p>
<p>記得在重慶時，曾寫過一篇一篇關於討論各國民族復典運動的文章。民族復興運動，根據歐洲的先例，包括文藝復興，宗敎改革，及政治大革命。</p>
<p>以印度來說，詩聖泰戈爾氏便主張要救印度必須拯救印度的靈魂，就是必須使印度也來一次文藝復興。等到印度的文藝復興完成，印度必能解除大英帝國的統治。因此他主張「選擇文化的標準，不在乎新與舊，而在乎這文化所含的精神價值。」他用本加里文所寫的詩歌，常敎給他所創辦的國際大學裏的學生唱。他所製成的譜曲，有二千五百餘首，對印度的音樂極有貢獻。國際大學藝術學院的畫，自成一派。一方面保存印度固有的藝術精神，一方面吸收各國藝術的長處，尤其是中國繪畫——其壁畫尤爲著名。此外印度的舞蹈，也很爲人鑒賞。</p>
<p>因爲泰氏的主張是這樣，因此和甘地的意見不無出入。甘地認爲印度民族如要復與，不管流血不流血，必須先從大英帝國手中解放出來，——政治先改革——才能有成，否則文藝復興毫無意義。但是泰氏認爲祗要先做到文藝復興，就可以使印度獨立的。不過，到了晚年，在受了現實的敎訓以後，他同意了甘地的說法，這可以在他晚年的著作裏看出來。</p>
<p>但是印度的民族革命便困難了，最大的阻礙是印度的宗敎太多了，除了我們所熟知的印度敎（佔全人口68.5％）回敎（21.7％）之外，還有佛敎，祁乃敎，塞克敎，基督敎等等，大約有二三十種之多，而道些宗敎則各不相容，所以要印度統一獨立，的確很困難。還有印度社會的階級觀念很深，甘地也想打破這些界限。印度的賤民們沒有衣服穿，他們祗圍了一塊有，賤民們沒有鞋穿，他也赤足，賤民們戴不起帽子，他就光頭，這就是他要打破這些界限的表現。</p>
<p>有次他絕食三週，到二週時，他的醫師洛埃對接近他的朋友說他要死了，但到十五天，他的信心恢復，說：上帝要我活，我還要爲印度做工作。於是他先做了回敎，印度敎，基督敎和自己的詩的鵡告以後，再重行進食。他實在是一個聖人，稱他聖雄還嫌不够，他可以說是近代印度的釋迦牟尼。</p>
<p>所以印度的復興是先走文藝復興的路，政治改革尚未做完，宗敎革命則正在做。</p>
<p>我們的民族復興運動是孫中山先生革命開始，到現在大約已有六十年了，有沒有成功呢？沒有！文藝復興則剛巧和印度相反，落在後面，從五四運動時開始，到現在還沒有成功。當然我們承認文藝工作者們已有了很多的貢獻，但是我們有多少著作在國際上有地位，我們的繪畫，音樂，舞蹈呢？從這些方面來看，我們及不上印度，印度的困難在於宗敎革命，而我們左的不是宗敎革命，而是一個社會改造運動。</p>
<p>文藝復與不祇是我們這幾個拿筆桿的人的事，政治改革也不祇是政府和政黨的事，這些是大多數人的事，應該有大多數人參加才對。所以對現狀不滿而埋怨政府，對外國侵略我們而埋怨外國人，甚至怨及個人都無用處，最主要還是使自己站起來，自己站得起來，什麼都可解決，而要使自己站得起來，這個社會需要改造，否則隨你提倡民主政治也好，普及敎育也好，還是沒有用的。</p>
<p>不過，政治改革也好，社會改造也好，最藝本的間題還是在於經濟，經濟情形改善了。其他才有辦法。一個作家如果每天煩　　　　　　，試問還有什麼好的作品產生？</p>
<p>說到經濟，中略的經濟復興　　　在　全人口百分之八十以上的晨民身上，農民如其不受剝削，不被壓迫，生活情形改善，其他工商業就有辦法，否則四萬萬人在餓肚皮，其他的五千萬居然過得下去，這是不可想像的。</p>
<p>中國將來的社會改造的路不是暴動就是和平。我們不談思想，主義等等，祇問他對老百姓是怎樣態度。如其我們有辦法，使百分之八十以上的人足衣足食，站起來了，其他一切都有辦法。</p>
<p>中國能復興，印度也必復興。中印兩個佔全世界人口差不多一半的民族能以「自力更生」，那末現在的所謂兩大對立的壁壘，也許會停止鬥爭。英國現在答應印度自治，就是怕印度傾向蘇聯。中國如其復興，用不到向別人乞憐求助，他們誰不願意同中國做朋友呢？</p>
<p>我們打了這八年仗，是否還要用暴動來改革社會，得問問老姓受不受得住才行。社會改造是一個大事業，需要大家來研究，建議，實行，然後可以救民族敎國家。（五月十八日於文藝茶話會講）</p>
<h3>黃山藝人</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>黃山是中國名山裏，最適於畫中國山水畫的山，因爲它旣有天都，蓮花的雄壯偉大，又有始信散花的奇峭秀麗；而雲海的浩渺，西海的怪誕，尤出乎人的意料之外。黃山的變化無窮，所以取爲畫稿也就豐富無比，古今書家，能取共一邱一壑，一峰一松，都足以名當時而傳後世。如淸代的石濤，梅瞿山，梅鹿野，漸江諸公，都是以書黃山著各的，近代畫家畫黃山的，尤爲衆多，如張大千，錢瘦鐵，陳小蝶等，其尤著者。近人論書的，因有黃山派之稱。余亦曾兩遊黃山，爲山靈寫照；至於黃山人而寫黃山者，有黃賓虹，汪采白，許士騏諸氏。賓虹年逾八十，肥遁燕市，所畫黃山，每不甚似；如九方暴的相馬，須相賞於牝牡驪黃之外。采白所畫黃山，筆墨酣暢，色彩婉麗，不即不離，形神俱肖。士騏幼嗜藝事，已禀名山靈秀之氣，長而捕學，冶中西繪畫於一爐；縱遊歐陸，觀藝巴黎，於西畫旣已升堂入室，盡抉其奧。返國後，又專究國書，於花卉翎毛人物山水，無不兼擅並妙。尤以所畫山水，並不拘拘於黃山；而裔松怪峯，又無在而不似黃山，這大槪是因爲所禀者厚，所韞者深，所以能自然流露，無不爲黃山傳神。士騏兄於勝利歸來後，創黃山藝苑於海上，牙籤玉軸，佈置幽雅，時有同道三五，談詩論畫，暇則含筆吮毫，揮洒點染，孜孜研究，昕夕不輟。從之學者亦日衆，以黃山人而畫黃山，而辦黃山藝苑，山以人重，人以山名，吾知黃山派的振興，正未有文。士騏兄近出其佳作，陳列陝西南路中國科學社，海上愛黃山者多，必能一飽眼福爲快。</p>
<h3>介紹蕭淑芳女士畫展</h3>
<p>— 曹未風</p>
<p>我不會畫，對於畫旣說不出事　的意見，又沒有什麼內行人的看法，不過我却喜歡看畫，我的喜歡看畫，　我的　　雕刻，聽音樂一樣，祗是業餘的喜歡，這些年來，凡是有畫展，祇要我的時間許可，我總是要看的；對於歐洲的那些博物院及畫廳，我也是但有機緣，絕不放過，這樣積而久之，對於一張畫，一件雖刻，一個樂曲，有時候好像也能有些意見了，不過我深知道，這全是業餘的見解。</p>
<p>一切藝術的創造，在創造者的精神活動上，與其創造的過程上，乃是完全一樣的，音樂如此，文學如此，繪畫亦如此，其唯一不同，祇是工具的不同而已。在西洋畫裏，同西洋文學一樣，在我看來，都是依着古典的，浪漫的，同寫實的三個階段前進的，我音樂方面，彷彿也是如此；因爲西洋人在精神上，在過去幾百年來的確有過這種演變的事實。</p>
<p>在一個藝術創造的創造生活上，也都有幾個過程，學習的時候不算，其後我們或者也可以分做三個階段：第一個是技巧的，第二個是創造的，第三個是天才的。這三個名詞是我杜撰出來的，在技巧的時期裏，創造者以其全力修養他的表達工具，他墓倣，他習作，他刻苦不停的孜孜追求着，在這個時期裏，手的訓練重於一切，精神的活動蘊落着，　伏着，培植着它的深度同闊度。</p>
<p>到了第二個時期裏，個性的特點出現了，從事藝術創造的人一定要到了這個階段，才能够自成一家。至於達到第三個階段，那却是可遇而不可求的，在古今多少的畫家裏，天才的大師，能爲一派之始社，以其創作爲人類永久的靈魂之撫慰的，實不多見。</p>
<p>由於生活，環境，修養等等條件，許多實家都是始終停滯在第一個階段裏的，這實在是一個極可惋惜的現象，這價原因，在我推想起來，大槪是技巧雖然已到高峯，而精神上的修養尚未能達到相襪的地步。創造必需較深刻的瞭解浮淺的觀察，不管你是如何用心，如何細膩，都是不够的。至於從第二個階段到達第三價階段，則非需要生活上的認識，與更廣大的同情心不可。</p>
<p>上面的那種說法，自是我自巴的理解，難免有外行之議。可是有一點，藝術創造者的最終造　如何其實倒可以不管，最重要的一點，乃是他是否時時在進步中。</p>
<p>淑芳是熟朋友，批許好壞，對於熟朋友，應該是在當面做的事，至於可以介紹給一般人的話呢，我可以說這乃是一位時時在進步中的畫家。</p>
<p>當初認識新恩同淑芳時，我紙曉得新恩兄是余日章先生的長公子，是醫生；淑芳是蕭友相先生的侄女，是賢主婦，可是不曉得這一對伉儷，還各有一樣專長。新恩的文章，同他的開刀手術一樣細膩，而淑芳的畫，則恰如其人，明麗瀟灑。</p>
<p>淑芳在倫敎開畫展時，我沒有來得及去，祇曉得極得彼邦人士的好評：她的這一次畫展本來可以早幾年舉行的，可是一來爲了戰事，二來爲了她一病數年，就不得不延展到現在來開。這裏面舊作雖有，而新作却更多，在她的國畫裏，我喜歡她的小件，在她的油畫裏，我却希望去看的人特別注意那幾輻瑞士及北平的風景畫。</p>
<p>（蕭女士畫展六月一日至七日在八仙橋靑年會舉行）</p>
<h3>參觀張茘英畫展後　論中國油畫的前途</h3>
<p>— 孫福熙</p>
<p>張茘英女史，於赴美展覽油書之前，在上海開會，與國人道別，這於中國藝術有很重大的意義。</p>
<p>中國人學習西洋油晝，至少已有五十年的歷史，當初是亦步亦趨的追隨而已，不但方法與題材均屬模倣西洋成作，甚且工具一與顏料畫布，一切都非用洋貨不可。所以移植而來的油畫，終於沒有在中國沃土上生根滋長，在表現者與欣賞者雙方均無若何的成就。</p>
<p>徼幸中之不幸，西洋人過分的愛好了中國的古畫，而且推廣到模做古畫的近作。</p>
<p>適巧抗戰開始，油蜜材料無法運來，又在模倣中國古畫的作品舉行展覽會，　還較油畫能够賣錢以維特生活，以致汕畫的根株幾乎枯絕。</p>
<p>荔英女史飽學歐陸，其畫學基礎之深厚，一般人未必盡信，但略知門徑者即能辨別其程度之高下，不如中國畫上難辯作者的程度。以此深厚的工力，來表現中國現實中特有的美妙，已足够令人欽佩，而且，當此油畫衰落的時期，堅忍不移，奮臂高呼，其識見之遠大與精神之勇猛，均菲一般畫人所能追及。</p>
<p>出品中的風景畫如「香港港景」，如「嘉興血印寺」等，能够繪影繪聲，表出中國的氣候，風俗，神話，哲學……而且，用民間的題材，在人物的精心構圖中，在靜物的隨意點綴中，均豐滿的傳達出中國社會之美。市國晝家當中很少這類的工作，這樣的成績；只有少數西洋人，在中國有過這一類的寫生，到歐美去展覽，但其了解之深切與選題的精到，總不及中國畫家的爲明。</p>
<p>中國景物與人情，甚多美的題材，荔英女史　國以前必能盡量補充，使之更加完善。</p>
<p>以住，中國　家所表現的，多半是古代的傳統的美，用油畫表現中國現代的美者，當以荔英女史爲最有力的先鋒，世界藝人都感激。</p>
<p>一次的藝術旅行而　　中國油畫的風氣，則在中國藝術更有重大的意義了。</p>
<h3>藝術的產生</h3>
<p>— 喻</p>
<p>現實的世界是缺陷的，人們都憶憬着理想的世界，理想着美滿的一切，這樣「形」與「神」便分了家。我們的形體雖不能超脫現實，彌補缺陷；但精神都可以不受現實的限制，而跳到另外一個超脫的理想的美滿世界中去。這便是原始的想像，藝術也就是它的第一件產品。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血523</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>不到三兩分鐘，二人已經跨過荒塲，襲到了窩子的個牆脚邊；沿路之上，不僅沒有碰到暗崗和陣碍，而且那窩子屋頂的烏烏鬼呌和探照燈行動鬧過一陣，也早已停止。人聲更是一些也沒有了。</p>
<p>守一看見這種局面，心下有些提摸不定，但自己「藝高瞻大」，只躊躇了一下，便對五六碼外的鶴見，打了一個暗號，自己雙手一伸，搭住圍牆，身子只一順，整個人已經上了牆頭。那牆頭上，除了些積年爬牆虎和些石苔外，倒也沒有裝上什麼碎玻璃和通電流之類的設施，（原來這裏是一所封閉已久的西人別墅，主人走了，地段不佳，無人租賃，荒在這裏，不想倒被這些城狐社鼠，做了巢穴。）</p>
<p>守一臥在牆頭，籠住眼光，定睛探察了一會，見那距離十來碼遠近的小洋房建築裏，燈光熄滅，毫無動靜，幾十碼外爲路燈微弱光綫，四射在門和窩的玻璃上，　托出這個建築的輸廓，一個三開問　三。層的舊式洋房。守一十分狐疑；便打手勢，呌鶴見上牆，鶴見當然也是身手矯捷，他見守一的手式，只道用不着在牆脚潛伏照應，便一蹤身，上了牆頭，伏在上面，和守一鬧成一個二龍戲珠的姿態。</p>
<p>「老鶴，」守一細聲說，「我看屋子裏都走空了，我們可以下去檢查了！可得留心絆脚炸彈一類的東西，也許還有一兩個暗崗潛伏着。」</p>
<p>「還是老兄領導罷。」鶴見客氣着。</p>
<p>兩人探着脚步，一路搜索，並無發現。直到上了石階，只聽見守一「嗜」了一聲，又「嗤」地一笑。</p>
<p>「什麼？」鶴見耳語似的，仍舊十分謹愼。</p>
<p>「回頭再告訴您，…這幾個淘氣也眞入那胡鬧……」守一說着，便放開步子，搶那敝開的大門；伸手一撓門邊電燈開關，見電燈鈕仍舊開着，却沒有燈火，知道那般傢伙臨走，也許竟把電流總綫斷了。</p>
<p>守一告訴鶴見暫待一會，自己去去就來。守一探摸着走去，不到一兩分鐘，只見屋內，陡地大放光明。守一也笑嘻嘻地大步走來：</p>
<p>「鬼子們只把總電門關上了，並沒有破壞。」</p>
<p>「倒是挺有道穗哩。……恐怕是留着再來吧！」鶴見冷笑着。</p>
<p>兩人着手檢查之前，因恐望外，還有暗崗，所以先到外邊，沿着圍牆，小叢，樹脚，等等所在　着走着。走到後院子門邊，守一似乎又看見了什麼，「哦」了一聲，又是「嗤」的笑了。</p>
<p>「什麼？」鶴見又這們間。</p>
<p>「瞧？」守一指着後門框上，呌鶴見看。</p>
<p>就着室內射來的燈光，鶴見定睛細看，見守一指定的所在，只有顏色蠟筆一類的東西，橫竖顚倒，竇着幾稱顏色綫條；</p>
<p>「是一種符號？」鶴見猜着。</p>
<p>「對哪！」守一微笑地答應，現沒在有工夫細說，總之，四大淘氣都來過了。……</p>

<p>有一天，自象不回來吃中飯。「難道又到和尚寺裏去找懸人了？」大家疑問。等到天黑，終於不回來。秀英當夜到寺裏去尋，不見。明天，又不回來。問題嚴重起來，我就寫二張海報：「尋　：敝處走失日月眼大白猫一隻。如有仁人君子覓得送還，奉酬法幣十萬元。儲款以待，決不食言。××路××號謹啓。」過了兩天，有鄰人來言，「前幾天看見一大白貓死在地藏庵與復性書之間的水沼裏，恐是你們的」。我們開耗奔喪，找不到屍體。問地藏　裏的警察，也說不知，又說，大概淸道夫取去了。我們回家，大家沈默誌哀，接着就討論牠的死因。有的說是牠自己失脚落水，有的說是頑意推牠下水，莫衷一是。後來新枚來報告，鄰家的孩子曾經看見一只大白猫死在水沼上的大柳樹根上。後來被人踢到水沼裏。孩子不會說誑，此說大約可靠。且吾聞之，猫不肯死在家裏，自知臨命終了，必遠行至無人處，然後辭世。故此說更覺可靠。我覺得這點「猫性」，頗可贊美。這有壯士風，不願死戶　下兒女子手中，而情願戰死沙塲，馬革裏尸。這又有高士風，不願病死床上，而情願遁跡深山，不知所終。總之，白象確已不在「　　」了！</p>
<p>白象失踪的第二天，林先從上海來杭。一到，先間自戲。　聞理耗，驚愷失色。因爲她原是受了段老太太之托，此番來枕將把白象帶回上海，重歸舊主的。相差一天，天緣何　！然而天實爲之，謂之何哉。所幸牠還有三個遺孤，雖非日月眼，而壯健活潑，足以承繼血統。爲防損失，特把一四小花猫寄交我的好友家。其餘兩四小自猫，常在我的身邊。每逢我架起了脚看報成吃酒的時候，牠們爬在我的兩隻脚上，一高一低，一動一靜，別人看見了都要笑。我到已經習以爲常，似覺一坐下來，脚上天生成有兩只小猫的。　卅六年五月廿七日於杭州作。</p>
<h3>田中奏摺眞僞辯</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>日本過去侵略兩方向—海洋與大陸政策之具體方策之由來，即爲田中奏摺。我國外交部以事實與此訐劃印證，若合符節，不能不以該奏摺爲日本對華眞正政策之具體表現。但日本自來即否認有該奏摺，因此奏摺之眞偽問題，遂爲中日所爭辯之一大疑題。</p>
<p>秦德純將軍出席遠東國際軍事法庭作證時，被告律師不肯放鬆的第一件事，就是他書面陳述中提到了田中奏摺。在道以前，七月二日岡田啓介之證言說：「田中可能欲先在滿洲發展，然後和平地漸漸向中國本部發進展：再一九二七年時，陸軍部內頗欲窺亞洲大陸，當時田中首相對大陸持有最後計劃，爲此曾派代表赴東北，謀取得重要鐵路之建設權。我沒有一看見過田中奏摺，所以我相信沒有這個文件。」岡田曾於一九二七年爲海相，必曾參與進窺大陸之國策，其證言中也暴露了田中侵華之意旨。</p>
<p>秦氏作證時，被告律師開始即引岡田之言轉詰，而他們的詰問，則是完全基於否認田中奏摺存在的觀點上發問。秦氏遂表明：中國人決不會假造奏摺的。且奏摺有無不關大旨，但事實證明日本征服全世界的計劃的各步驟，就是先侵略「滿蒙」，然後華北，及中國的大部，再後乃有攻擊珍珠港，佔領菲律賓之事實。我不能證明它的眞偽或不相信它，裏面預測的一切，就好像田中是預言家一般，與日本軍隊其後在中國的一步步行動，無不吻合。</p>
<p>此時期，今駐印大使羅家倫氏，曾著文提供他親歷之事實。一是：他曾訪張作霖時代即參興東北機要的親日派湯爾和（後做漢好），據他說：「這文件是費了許多力量從”本人手上得來的，這是一件很難辦的工作，詳細情形我都知道，並且看過日本文的原件，誰有這大的才氣，這樣的熟悉內情，可以假造得了！若是東北有這樣的人才，能造出這樣的文件，東北也不會有九一八了。」二是：　於二十四年在京中央某會後，和在東北負過責的某要人談及，說是將來回到東北，如該原件沒給日人搜到，可以給他看。羅氏且推斷這原件是副本和照片，日人知道這文件洩露出來之嚴重性，所以立予否認，和有銷毀原本之可能，戰後爲了减輕戰罪責任，更有消滅之必要。可惜羅氏未在湯爾和處詢明究竟，和沒有指出某人姓各及繼續追詢。</p>
<p>其後蘇聯檢察官在十月八日，又在東京國際法庭上提出業已在蘇絞決之俄好謝米諾夫之供詞，證實日本征服世界之計劃「田中奏摺」確有其事，謂田中義一曾親將此事告他。</p>
<p>總之，這個謎尚未能完全揭開，日本人否認；歐美注重實證，也自然懷疑到這文件存在。但我們則堅決以爲，這是事實上不能推翻的文件，尚希望國人能努力於探索這謎的內幕，予以完全揭露於世界，以證日本維新以來一貫的對華侵略政策。</p>

<h3>怎樣聽鋼琴獨奏？</h3>
<p>— 聲和</p>
<p>鋼琴獨奏（Piano）是普通音樂會中常有的節目，而鋼琴家個人的演奏會也嘗勿見，近代稱鋼琴獨奏會爲Piano　Recital，指彈奏時全不看譜，完全背奏的意思，這個名稱與方法，實自鋼琴大師李斯特（Liszt）始。</p>
<p>聽鋼琴獨奏，不能祇顧及音樂悅耳與否，因爲這是一種「解聽不解賞」的最淺薄的聽法同進步的音樂聽衆，對於鋼琴獨奏的欣賞，至少有下列幾種常識：</p>
<p>（一）注意彈奏的聲音是否清晰，尤其是快奏與跳奏（Staccato）序奏（Arpeggto）的時候，一個優秀的鋼琴演奏家，務使每一個音都彈奏得非常淸晰，不致模糊紊亂。</p>
<p>（二）注意手法是否靈活美觀，手法是彈奏鋼琴的重要因素，它不但關係着演奏技術，而且助長樂曲的表情，因爲習慣上鋼奏是放置在台上的左邊，所以去聽鋼琴獨奏的時候，應該預先選擇靠左邊的座位，這樣可以看得見獨奏者的手法。</p>
<p>（三）注意獨奏者對於樂曲的理解力，換句話說，就是關於表借方面的注意。一個優秀的鋼琴家。當他演奏的時候，自始至終，可以整個控制聽衆的視覺與聽覺，被他吸引得失去了自主力。緩徐處優柔　轉，疾急處活潑有力；鬆弛處泰然自若。緊張處如雷　萬鈞般地沉重。</p>
<p>（四）注意樂曲結尾的地方，大凡一首選作獨奏的曲子，都是技術與內容此較艱深織巧的鋼琴名曲，而其結尾處尤多特殊發揮之處，不是表情力更豐富，就是具有一個特別的結尾，表示樂曲的圓滿終止，所以聽衆要不放鬆彈奏快要終了時的注意力。</p>
<p>此外，假若你要進一步地欣賞出和聲（Harmony）美，獨奏者對於樂曲的發揮和演變成續的精到之處，則更須在事前瞭解樂曲的內容，而具備相當的修養了。</p>
<h3>是繆篆——不是謬篆</h3>
<p>— 劍華</p>
<p>二十九日自由談有豈重先生一篇「篆刻文字的話」，把「繆篆」讀成「謬篆」，說文解字序上說：</p>
<p>「自爾泰書有八體；一曰大篆，二曰小篆，三曰刻符，四曰蟲書，五日　印，七曰殳書，八曰隸書」。</p>
<p>「自亡新（即王莽）居攝，使大司空甄豐等校文書之部，自以爲應制作，頗改定古文，時有六書：一曰古文，孔子壁中書也；二曰奇字，即古文而異者也；三曰篆書，即小篆，秦始皇帝使下社人程邈所作也，四曰左書，即秦隷書，五曰繆篆，所以墓印也，六曰蟲言，所以書幡信也」。</p>
<p>「繆篆本來是墓印的字，爲甚麼呌「繆篆」呢？段玉栽說文解字注說。</p>
<p>「繆，讀綢繆之繆」。</p>
<p>可見不是謬讚之謬。</p>

<h3>「問諜忠魂」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>繼「粉紅色的炸彈」後，這又是部描寫「地下工作者」的影片，故事是叙述重慶派了諜報人員飛到廣州去工作，於是展開了跟日本特務的火拼，搜集情報，炸毀電台，安排了一連串的驚險事件。</p>
<p>在這裏女人是通行無阻的，袁美雲飾演的那個女諜報員，可以爲所欲爲，日本的特務機關長空崎與特務長山本，簡直被她玩弄於手掌之中。</p>
<p>最可惋惜的是全劇許多人物，都是懸空的。這種痴人說夢的劇本，它能給我們些什麼東西呢？</p>
<p>袁美雲·王引·許良·顧文宗·都在賣力的做「戲」·談不上演技的優劣，餃爲差强人意的只有袁靈雲的高峯川子。</p>
<p>從每一個塲面的處理，蒙太奇的運用，戲的剪接上，都可以看到導演者的低能與缺乏常識。總之這是一部浪費膠片浪費觀衆時間的影片。</p>

<h3>第六感覺</h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾祺</p>
<p>你有否這樣的感覺——在尚未拿起聽筒接一個突如其來的電話前·已經能够約略猜到這個來電者是誰？你更有否這樣的經騐——當一個人在沒有說出一句話前，已經能够猜出那句話的意思？假使有，這就是心理學家所謂的超外預感（ESP）——第六感覺，質言之，這是一種沒有經過視·觸。聽。味·嗅五覺所得到的一種感覺事物的本能。</p>
<p>心理學家萊恩敎授與他的助手們在丟克大學做了十七年的研究工作，證明第六感覺的存在。最普遍的一種試騐方法是「透視」，即沒有經過視覺和觸覺而去猜測一幅圖畫的內容，關於這些，美國著名的幸福雜誌會經選了很多材料，所得到的結論是：凡是精神方面正常的人，都應該有第六感覺的可能；有密切關係的人，像孿生或夫婦等更爲顯現，往往兩孿生者會同時考慮到同一件極奇怪的事件。再舉一例：有人在出門旅行之前，突然發生一種莫名的感覺，似乎某種危險將襲擊他，於是他中止了這次的旅行，結果，他所預擬搭乘的交通工具果然失事了。</p>
<p>心理學家告訴我們，第六感覺是極不容易加以控制的，否則，這神秘得說不出所以然的第大感覺將不再不可思議的了。（本文取材自幸福雜誌五月號）</p>

<p>正在這時候，張昌突然又氣急敗　　狂奔而至。</p>
<p>「老祝，胡太太的熟度更高了！危險得很！危險得很！」他搶到老祝面前，滿頭大汗，用極急促的語調說：「她手臂上又發出了好些一紅點，恐怕是斑疹傷寒。你得趕快想辦法才好！」</p>
<p>「唉！糟，糟！」盧跛子不自覺地又　了一口氣。</p>
<p>今天所發生的一切事好　全是故意在和老祝爲　，他禁不住開始焦燥起來。</p>
<p>「想辦法？老兄，你　！這地方有什麼辦法好想？」他　圓了一雙　子，憤憤地瞅定着張昌的臉，彷彿在跟他生氣似地。</p>
<p>「現在，第一就是要救胡太太。不是趕快給她找醫生，便是使她趕快離開這兒，到一處有醫生的所在！」張昌喘息着說。地對蘭雖然也很關切，但和祝兆年跟蘭的感情來比，當然又有不同，因此他的心思倒並沒有亂，話說得很有條理。</p>
<p>「車子？醫生？祇要有，我老說拿命去換也是願意的，…………」他的紳經顯然已有一些失常，說話不覺激烈得像　諭一樣，聲音也變得又高又銳，使聽的人覺得怪刺耳的。</p>
<p>「醫生我倒有。」張昌漸漸瞭解他的情緒了，便竭力安定了自己的心神，改用一種和綏的語氣說：「祇要再上去一站，就是河池，河池是一個縣，有一所縣立醫院，我的叔叔就在那兒當主任醫師…………。」</p>
<p>這幾句話等於給老祝喝了一大碗凉水，心裏才略略鎭靜一些。</p>
<p>「很好，這樣很好！」他透出了緊決的神氣說：「那末，我立刻去跟他們商量車子。不管怎樣，讓我們先把蘭送到　　再說！」</p>
<p>說着，他立刻撇下了盧前張昌，急急擠向人叢中去。</p>

<h3>The Council Quickly Conducted Discussions; Over a Hundred Proposals Were Passed; Suggested that the Government Revise the Sino-Soviet Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The 14th session of the Political Consultative Council was held in the morning of the 31st to begin discussing proposals. The meeting started at 9:30 AM, with 192 council members in attendance, chaired by Lin Hu. The council passed opinions on the review of the national defense report, opinions on the review of foreign affairs and overseas Chinese affairs reports, and 60 proposals. The First Review Committee passed 45 proposals, including 4 on national defense, 4 on military service, 3 on military assessments, 4 on military affairs in North China, 2 on military discipline, 9 on local armed forces, 3 on military personnel treatment, 2 on military education and training, 5 on the placement of surplus military officers and the support of families of war dead, and 9 others. The Second Review Committee passed 14 proposals, including 4 on Japanese reparations, 3 on the Macau, Hong Kong, and Yunnan-Burma issues, 1 on the foreign affairs personnel system, 4 on overseas Chinese affairs, 1 on the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and 2 others. Most of the proposals were sent to the government for reference and handling, followed by those requested to be handled or earnestly handled by the government, and the others were requested to be withdrawn or retained by the original proposers. The discussion proceeded smoothly. In the military and national defense sections, only Council Member Wang Guoyuan and others proposed "Requesting the government to issue a clear order to stop requisitioning in kind," and Council Member Li Peiguo and others proposed "Requesting the central government to fulfill the elimination of guerrilla units and the establishment of people's armed forces." Both proposals were slightly discussed. Regarding the former, Yang Buping explained that the proposal should be revised, suggesting that the government improve the system of conscription in kind instead of retaining it. Subsequently, Wang Zemin, the convener of the group, explained the review process, and it was generally agreed that it should be retained. After a vote, it was still passed by a majority of 117 votes, retaining it according to the review opinion. In the latter proposal, the issue of "guerrilla units" was heatedly discussed, and it was generally believed that the term "guerrilla units" was inappropriate, and they had made considerable contributions to local defense during non-wartime, so they should not be eliminated. It was decided to change it to "Requesting the central government to strictly reorganize the local troops in Rehe and establish people's armed forces," and it was decided to send it to the government for handling. Secondly, in the Second Review Committee, regarding the Japanese reparations section, Lin Zhong proposed that "to control Japan, our country should strive for an active position, dismantle and transport Japanese reparations materials, and conscript technical personnel from Taiwan Province to assist in the dismantling and transportation of Japanese reparations materials," changing "Taiwan Province" to "various provinces." Secondly, regarding the proposal by Council Member Wang Puhan and others to "ensure territorial integrity and maintain domestic order, the government should propose to revise the Sino-Soviet Treaty and quickly recover Lushun and Dalian," the original review team believed that it should be retained because, at a time when Sino-Soviet relations are tense, it is difficult in practice to propose amendments again before the Sino-Soviet Treaty has been implemented. At the same time, if this issue is raised, the reaction may not be ideal, and it may even increase harm to Sino-Soviet relations. Huang Yuren, Xie Bingxin, and others strongly advocated this view, believing that it should be retained. Xie also explained that if this proposal is passed, it would be tantamount to launching a war of nerves against Soviet diplomacy and causing some stimulation. Convener Zhou Qianchong also reiterated the review process, but Wang Yinhun, Pan Chaoying, and others emphasized that a review of the full text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty reveals situations such as the partitioning of our country's territory, the damage to our country's sovereignty, and the restriction of our country's administration. Therefore, they strongly advocated sending it to the government for handling. The atmosphere in the meeting was heated for a while, and speakers were very enthusiastic. Subsequently, the chairman summarized the opinions from all sides as roughly two items: sending it to the government for earnest handling and retaining it. After a vote, out of 164 people present, 123 people agreed to "send it to the government for earnest handling," and it was passed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The 15th session of the Political Consultative Council was held at 3:45 PM on the 31st, discussing the reports of various review committees at the fastest rate. 195 council members attended, chaired by Li Huang. The meeting passed 73 cultural and educational proposals, one opinion on the review of the education report, 24 financial and economic proposals, 26 transportation proposals, 21 political proposals, and 7 temporary motions, totaling 151 proposals and one opinion on the review of the education report. Only three proposals were retained. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:45 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Political Consultative Council continued its general meeting on the 1st to discuss the review reports of various groups.</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Reform the Monetary System Sent to the Government for Adoption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The proposal by Council Members Yin Lianxian and others to suggest that the government reform the monetary system was passed by the 15th session of the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 31st and sent to the government for earnest study, selection, and implementation. After the proposal was presented at the meeting today, Sun Shengwu and others argued that this proposal could only be sent to the government for reference. If it is passed according to the review opinion and sent to the government for earnest study, selection, and implementation, it may affect the market. Chen Baoyin, the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, stood up to explain that the reasons for this proposal are very substantial, and many of the proposed methods are also applicable. Therefore, the review committee decided to send it to the government for earnest study, selection, and implementation. In fact, the so-called earnest study, selection, and implementation are not much different from the so-called sending it to the government for reference. As for the argument that the passage of this proposal will cause market fluctuations, the review committee has also paid attention to this and believes that it will not have a significant impact. Finally, it was passed according to the review opinion. The four methods recommended in Yin's original proposal are recorded below: (1) Issue new banknotes guaranteed by gold, with reserves not less than 50% and a limited amount of issuance; (2) The issued legal tender should still be used as auxiliary currency, and no more should be issued, and the exchange rate between it and the new currency should be determined; (3) The exchange rate between the new currency and the US dollar or British pound should be determined to ensure its credit stability; (4) The new currency should be issued independently, and an independent issuance system should be established.</p>
<p>In addition, the following important financial proposals passed at the meeting on the 31st: (1) The proposal by Xi Lun and others to request the government to restore the reserve ratio system for the issuance of legal tender in order to rebuild the credit of legal tender and stabilize the value of legal tender. This proposal was sent to the government for selection and implementation; (2) The proposal by Wang Weixin and others that legal tender should be used completely within the territory of China, and all regional currency systems should be abolished immediately, was amended and passed, requesting the government to earnestly handle it; (3) The proposal by Wei Jiqing and others to request the government to stop issuing large amounts of banknotes in order to stabilize prices and save the economic crisis was sent to the government for reference; (4) The proposal by Xi Lun and others to request the government to allow the people to import permitted materials with gold and foreign exchange, so as to use the private sector's own strength to seek material abundance and price stability was passed and sent to the government for selection and implementation.</p>
<h3>Complete Tranquility Throughout the Yikezhao League</h3>
<p>Chen Yujia Went to Zhangjiakou to Report on His Duties</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 30th] Complete tranquility throughout the Yikezhao League. Garrison Commander Chen Yujia went from Suiyuan to Zhangjiakou on the night of the 29th to report on his duties to Fu Zuoyi.</p>
<h3>The Peace Conference with Japan Should be Held in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Temporary Motion by Pan Chaoying and Others</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Pan Chaoying and 52 others recently submitted a temporary motion to the Political Consultative Council, requesting the government to take the initiative in diplomacy and select September 18th to hold a peace conference with Japan in Shenyang, and requesting the government to immediately notify the relevant governments of various countries and establish an organization to prepare for the reception of international guests.</p>
<h3>The Course of the Social Democratic Party's Dispute</h3>
<p>Zhang Junmai Held a Press Conference to Report</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Social Democratic Party held a press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Feng Jinbai, Ji Yiqiao, Yang Yuzi, Jin Houcheng, and others attended. Reporters from various newspapers raised the issue that Zhang Junmai usually avoided seeing reporters, and Mr. Zhang expressed his apologies on the spot and explained his difficulties. He then gave a comprehensive report on the party's internal disputes.</p>
<p>After Zhang's report, reporters asked questions one after another, and the answers were as follows: (1) Expulsion from the party is not permanent in nature. Within the scope of law and reason, it is hoped that it can be restored as soon as possible. Wu Xianzi will not participate in the reform faction, nor will he separate from the Social Democratic Party. (2) Regarding the overseas committee's request for Wu Xianzi to represent 25 votes to attend the organizing committee, and Zhang's firm refusal, Zhang initially denied it, and then said that he could not accept this request. (3) Regarding the student unrest, it was said that persuasion should be used, and arrest is not the best policy. When arrest is implemented, it should be done in accordance with judicial procedures. As for how to quell the student unrest, efforts should be made to resolve the students' dissatisfaction, such as improving teachers' salaries and students' meals. (4) The sealing of newspapers should also be handled in accordance with judicial procedures. (5) Regarding the resumption of peace talks, Zhang believes that the government should extend the hand of peace, regardless of the other party's reaction. Even if the other party does not express anything, it is not a matter of losing face. When asked what contributions the party is prepared to make to state affairs, the answer was that it is still under consideration and cannot be disclosed at this time.</p>
<h3>The Political Consultative Council Passed the Proposal of Jiang Yong and Others; Requested the Government to Borrow from the United States; The Use of Funds to be Supervised by Public Opinion Organs</h3>
<p>[Our Agency, Nanjing, 31st] When the Political Consultative Council held its 15th meeting on the afternoon of the 31st, it passed by a majority vote the proposal of Jiang Yong and 80 others to "Request the government to quickly launch economic recovery work and quickly consult with the United States to borrow funds for construction." The meeting decided that the proposal should be sent to the government for quick handling. In order to ensure that the loan is used specifically for construction and does not become bureaucratic capital, it was decided that after the loan is established in the future, public opinion organs will supervise its use. After the proposal was submitted, proposer Jiang Yong briefly explained that after our country has experienced a long war, various construction projects are waiting to be launched, but due to limited financial resources, the work has not been successfully realized. I deeply hope that the United States can lend us huge sums of money. The reason why this proposal was submitted by the Political Consultative Council is to show that this is the public opinion of the people of the whole country, not the will of the government. Subsequently, council members spoke one after another, most of whom expressed their approval. Only Chen Yaodong and others believed that the methods were worth considering. Yin Shuxian supported Jiang's proposal, pointing out that after this proposal is passed, foreign friends who intend to help China will be more forceful when speaking to their own countries. Chen Bosheng also believes that our economic situation is serious, which is known to both China and foreign countries. There is no need to avoid it. Since we are unable to carry out construction on our own, it is indeed acceptable for this public opinion organ to appeal to the United States on behalf of the government. Even in terms of foreign countries, there are many precedents for Congress to propose loan appeals. Chen Yaodong opposed the proposal for loans from public opinion organs. He explained that the US-Turkey and US-Greece loans have no problems, but the reason why our country's loan has not yet been agreed is not the problem of the United States, but the fact that our country has failed to put forward a concrete plan. At the same time, the government has also stated that everything depends on self-reliance. If this council passes the loan proposal, it will indicate that our economy is on the verge of collapse, which is not a glorious thing. He agreed that the government should come forward to borrow from the United States, but did not advocate that the Political Consultative Council overstep its authority. Rong Zhao did not agree with the use of foreign loans to make bureaucratic capital rich. Finally, the vote was announced. Out of 145 people in the audience, it was passed by a majority of 98 votes and sent to the government for quick handling.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 31st] According to authoritative sources, the Chinese government has begun consultations with the US government regarding the US Export-Import Bank's loan of 500 million yuan to China. The Chinese government has already sent the plan for the use of the loan to Washington and submitted it to the US government. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not commented on this.</p>
<h3>The Resolution on the Proposal to Postpone the Election was Retained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] At the meeting of the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 31st, the council members had a heated debate on whether or not the various elections within this year should be held. At that time, some people suggested that due to the turbulent domestic situation, the elections should be postponed. However, the majority argued that if the council passes this proposal, it would infringe on the powers of the National Assembly and affect the implementation of constitutional government. Finally, it was decided that the original proposal would be retained.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 31st] More than 20 leaders from all walks of life in Shanxi, including Wang Huaiming, launched a signature campaign to realize peace, requesting the central government to resolutely implement the Principle of People's Livelihood of regulating capital and land to the tiller, as well as Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The telegram sent to the Political Consultative Council for public decision suggested to the government: "If we want to achieve true peace in the country, we must first thoroughly eradicate the source of chaos. The private system has a big gap. Capital and land have become factors for the Communist Party to create chaos. The Communist Party takes advantage of this gap to form an unignorable destructive force and is planning to coerce a million young men and search for tens of billions of property within three months as capital for struggle. If we talk about peace after they grow stronger, it will only make them stronger. If we talk about war, it will be impossible to suppress them. We must fill the social gap and cut off the source of chaos before we can talk about peace or war."</p>
<h3>The Council Members Inquired about Peace and War; The Ministry of National Defense Responded in Writing; The Current Military Actions are Truly Unavoidable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Ministry of National Defense recently responded in writing to the council members' inquiries about peace and war, stating that the duty of the Ministry of National Defense is to ensure peace. The current military actions are completely forced and truly unavoidable. For the sake of the country and the people, the government has repeatedly exercised restraint and strived for peace and stability. If there are effective ways to promote negotiations, it will naturally be greatly welcomed. Regarding the military foundation that has been laid, the Communist army originally occupied 559 county towns. As of early April, 232 county towns have been recovered. The recovered railway lines total 1,165 kilometers within the customs and 5,145 kilometers outside the customs. Huaiyin, Linyi, Zhangjiakou, and Yan'an, all of which were bases of the Communist army, have also been successively recovered, depriving them of their political and military bases. The National Army has achieved great strategic success. The factors for the Communist army's failure are all present. It is hoped that unification and peace can be completed before the implementation of constitutional government, so that the country can embark on the path of construction.</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Began to Mediate the Student Unrest; The Political Consultative Council Put Forward Specific Opinions; Students in Nanjing and Peiping Will Stop Marching Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Legislative Yuan passed the student unrest work, which began on the 31st. Lu Fu, Chen Guyuan, Fu Tongxian, Tan Tiwu, Liu Keqiao, Sun Qu, Xia Taosheng, Jiang Shoushi, and other eight people received student representatives twice on the 31st and visited Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, and Zhang Lisheng.

The legislative members went to visit Zhu Jiahua and asked him to love the young students. In the afternoon, at 2:00, they visited Zhang _ to study the abolition of the measures for maintaining order. Zhang said: I also think that this measure is not entirely appropriate, but this is not the government exerting pressure on the students, but it is actually to love the students and prevent them. Since the measure has been announced, it is difficult to abolish it, and it is obvious that there are Communist Party members instigating this student unrest. The legislative members once again applied for the meaning of loving students. Zhang said that he has telegraphed Mayor Wu to inquire about the arrest of students in Shanghai.

For the sake of the present, education should seek progress in stability. Do not make unnecessary changes to avoid giving others an excuse. As for how party and团 factions should withdraw from schools, responsible personnel of each school should be ordered to discuss it from time to time so that it can be realized as soon as possible. Schools should register students who participate in parties, and newspapers should publish them so that they can take responsibility for their words and deeds. At the meeting, Zou Shuwen suggested that educational measures that should be taken, such as the faculty and department issues of some schools, should be resolved immediately. The meeting decided to add them to the original review opinions.</p>

<h3>Report on National Defense and Foreign Affairs, Political Council Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>National Defense</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The following is the resolution on the report of the Ministry of National Defense passed by the Political Council at its 14th meeting on the morning of the 31st:</p>
<p>This council has reviewed the section on national defense in the work report of the Executive Yuan, and listened to the oral report of Vice Minister Lin of the Ministry of National Defense. It has learned that the national defense authorities are generally able to implement the demobilization and reorganization of the army and national defense construction in a step-by-step manner according to the plan. However, there are still areas that need to be improved. The following is a detailed description of what we have observed:</p>
<p>The Policy of Army Reorganization Should Be Changed</p>
<p>(1) The policy of army reorganization should be changed to meet current needs. The task of the army is to protect the country and defend the people. At a time when border defenses are not yet consolidated and local order is still in turmoil, military affairs are no less important than during the War of Resistance. Therefore, in order to consolidate national defense and stabilize local areas, the policy of army reorganization should be to actively strive for the realization of the principle of elite troops, and to enrich their quality. As for the reorganization process, it is appropriate to enrich and improve the quality of the existing troops, strengthen their training, and strive to mobilize spirit, politics, and materials to coordinate with military strength, so as to achieve the task of protecting the country and defending the people.</p>
<p>(2) Focus on the weaknesses of the army and strive to improve them.</p>
<p>The common weaknesses of today's army are poor military discipline, low quality of officers and soldiers, inaccurate intelligence, and ineffective command. We must earnestly increase military spending, improve treatment, and strive to improve the lives of officers and soldiers. Strengthen education and intelligence training to improve quality. Eliminate long-standing malpractices, rectify military discipline, and enhance the strength of the army. We should pay close attention to the ability and reputation of commanders to ensure the cooperation of generals and marshals. Strict rewards and punishments, combined with reality, are especially important to demonstrate fairness.</p>
<p>(3) Enrich local armed forces and strive for coordination with military administration.</p>
<p>Given the urgency of stabilizing local areas today, in order to promote the widespread advancement of the national army's strength and achieve the effect of quelling the rebellion as soon as possible, it is urgently needed to enrich local armed forces, train them, and replenish their ammunition at any time, so as to assist the national army. The military officers leading the local armed forces should be selected locally to achieve twice the result with half the effort. It is necessary to ensure that the enrichment of local armed forces is closely coordinated with the facilities of military administration, so as to achieve the goal of early local stability.</p>
<p>Various Pensions Should Be Handled Conscientiously</p>
<p>(4) All kinds of pensions should be handled conscientiously.</p>
<p>Soldiers dedicate themselves to the country and go in and out of danger. If the disabled cannot support themselves and the dead cannot be compensated for their families, it is not enough to encourage and reward the capable. Therefore, the handling of pensions should be prompt and reliable, and the amount of pension should also be adjusted and increased. This is all related to the morale of the army and is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>(5) Retired officers should be promptly and properly resettled.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Ministry of National Defense, there are more than 250,000 retired officers. Most of these people are meritorious soldiers in the War of Resistance, and the capable ones should be selected and continue to be employed. Those who have already gone through the transfer procedure should also be guaranteed employment. Retired officers should be promptly assisted in returning to their hometowns, and local governments should be responsible for providing them with job opportunities or production subsidies.</p>
<p>(6) Military academy students should be employed as much as possible.</p>
<p>Military academies are the cradle of military cadres. The country has invested a great deal of effort in education and training, with the aim of enabling them to dedicate their knowledge to the country. It is a pity that some are left idle. Moreover, there is still a lack of cadres in the current army, so it is necessary to find ways to settle them as much as possible.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The following is the resolution on the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs passed by the Political Council at its 14th meeting on the morning of the 31st:</p>
<p>After reviewing the written report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and listening to the oral reports of President Zhang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this council deeply understands that the basic foreign policy of the government is to seek harmony and cooperation between our country and friendly countries, and harmony and cooperation between friendly countries, to uphold the Charter of the United Nations, and to faithfully fulfill treaty obligations, which is our unwavering belief. It is also determined to defend sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, maintain our international status, and maintain world peace. This council believes that this principle is correct and appropriate, and should be constantly strived for in order to achieve its thorough realization. However, this council cannot but provide opinions for the government, which are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of the peace treaty with Germany, our country is a member of the Allied countries. Since we fought side by side during the war, we must jointly draft the peace treaty after the war without any room for objection. Moreover, the Five-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London in September 1945 had a solemn resolution. Therefore, our country should not only be one of the invited countries for the peace conference with Germany, but also have the right to participate in the meeting to draft the peace treaty with Germany. Therefore, we hope that the government will firmly stand its ground and argue on the basis of reason, so as to achieve success.</p>
<p>Quickly Draft a Draft Peace Treaty with Japan</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the issue of the control of Japan, our country is the country that suffered the most from Japanese aggression. The policy of controlling Japan should be earnestly implemented in accordance with the recommendations of this council over the years. Our country has no intention of revenge against Japan. If Japan can establish a truly democratic and peaceful country and completely abandon its aggressive ideology, our country will not hesitate to give it a chance to regenerate. The representatives of our country attending the Far Eastern Commission in Washington and the representatives participating in the Four-Power Committee on Japan in Tokyo should, at any time and on any matter, clarify our country's position and determination, so that the Allied countries can agree with our country's solemn demands. As for the current issues of determining the amount of compensation, correcting educational thought, and stipulating light industry standards, we should base them on detailed and reasonable plans in order to achieve the goal. Negotiating a peace treaty with Japan is an inevitable stage sooner or later, and it is very important for our country to stand in an active position and quickly draft a concrete draft of a peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of Sino-Soviet relations, the government has been making efforts to improve diplomatic relations in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. However, it is regrettable that the Soviet Union has not faithfully fulfilled the provisions of the treaty. In the future, the government should continue to use all diplomatic methods to argue on the basis of reason, so as to achieve the goal of earnestly implementing the treaty and recovering the sovereignty of the Northeast as soon as possible. Regarding the transfer of industrial equipment by the Soviet army in the Northeast and the damage caused to the local people, the government should continue to negotiate and demand compensation in order to maintain national rights and appease the anger of the people. As for the recovery of Dalian and Lushun, we should make efforts to negotiate quickly in accordance with the treaty in order to protect the integrity of our territory.</p>
<p>Negotiate the Recovery of Macau and Hong Kong and Kowloon</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the issue of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty, the United Kingdom is one of our country's main allies, and Sino-British relations have always been friendly. In order to enhance Sino-British friendship, we hope that the government will quickly negotiate a Sino-British Commercial Treaty with the United Kingdom in order to promote friendly relations and promote international trade.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the issue of protecting overseas Chinese, the government should strictly order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to instruct all ambassadors and consuls to earnestly implement the policy of protecting overseas Chinese, and to carefully select candidates for ambassadors and consuls, and strengthen the effectiveness of overseas Chinese affairs in embassies and consulates in order to achieve the practical effect of protecting overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the issue of recovering Macau and Hong Kong and Kowloon, this is the unanimous demand of the Chinese people. The government has repeatedly negotiated, but to no avail. This council sincerely hopes that the government will continue to make efforts to negotiate in order to achieve the goal of recovering territorial sovereignty in the spirit of peaceful negotiation.</p>

<h3>The Puyang Section of the Jinpu Railway is Open to Traffic, Journalists' Group from Beijing and Shanghai Visits Confucius Temple in Qufu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yanzhou, 31st dispatch] The opening ceremony of the Puyang section of the Jinpu Railway will be held in Yanzhou City at 10:00 a.m. on the 1st. Deputy Director Chen of the Railway arrived in Yanzhou on the afternoon of the 31st to preside over the ceremony. The observation train returned south at 11:30 a.m. on the 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yanzhou, 31st dispatch] The current popular opinion in China unanimously and urgently requires the restoration of transportation. Journalists have increased their belief in this during the opening of the Puyang section of the Jinpu Railway. Trains had already been running between Pukou and Lincheng on the Jinpu Railway. After the National Army cleared the Communist army between Lincheng and Yanzhou and between Yanzhou and Jinan, the railway rescue team, together with two railway corps, first restored the 87 kilometers and 80 meters of track and bridge engineering between Lincheng and Yanzhou. They successfully completed the project within 56 days at a rate of 1.84 kilometers per day. When they were laying the project, thousands of people would gather spontaneously every time they reached a station, cheering along the road. Even today, when the train that the journalists were riding passed through various places north of Lincheng, many farmers were seen by the roadside stopping their farming and smiling to greet them. The people's sincere support for the restoration of transportation almost moved the journalists to tears. Most of the stations north of Lincheng have become desolate. There are more than 160 carriages destroyed by the Communist army near Lincheng, and there are many piles of steel. The city appearance of Yanzhou is relatively tidy, because the National Army's Wu Huawen Department quickly defeated the Communist army's offensive here. According to the ride, it took six hours to complete the journey between Lincheng and Yanzhou today, averaging 15 kilometers per hour. The track is made up of odds and ends, but the train runs very steadily. Yanzhou is the middle station of the Jinpu Railway.

There is no need for this amount at present, but relying solely on domestic production is not enough to cope with the situation. Therefore, it is hoped that the 200,000 tons of chemical fertilizer needed can be transported to Taiwan as soon as possible and distributed to farmers as soon as possible. He also said: This province also needs plant fertilizer and is working hard to find a solution. He emphasized: There is no problem with fertilizer payment.</p>

<h3>Wheat Enters the Market in Shaanxi, Grain Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 31st Dispatch] As both major and minor wheat varieties enter the market, grain prices continue to decline. Although several counties in the wheat-producing areas of the province reported drought and hail disasters this summer, the actual situation is often not as severe as reported. Judging from preliminary statistics that are not yet complete for the entire region, the harvest in the province this summer is neither poor nor bountiful. The current price of wheat in Xi'an is 18,000 yuan per market dou, while the highest selling price two weeks ago was 28,000 yuan, a decrease of about one-third. Therefore, some hoarders are urgently selling off stockpiled cotton to stockpile large amounts of wheat.</p>

Starting the day before yesterday, prices suddenly soared again, with market prices quoted at 240,000, and it was difficult to buy. The reason is that rice prices in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhu, and Bengbu are all higher than here, and speculative capital is rushing to purchase, while hoarders are bullish and unwilling to sell, causing people's minds to be as uneasy as they were ten days ago.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 31st Dispatch] The Third Criminal Tribunal of the Jiangsu High Court today sentenced Zheng Fengshi from Taicang, one of the protagonists of the Jiangnan Massacre, to life imprisonment.

Zheng then personally wrote a book outlining the entire plan for uncovering the espionage network in southern Jiangsu and presented it to Haruki Yonemura, leading to the unprecedented Jiangnan Massacre. On July 9 of that year, large-scale arrests were carried out in Shanghai, Taicang, Kunshan, Wujiang, Changshu, Songjiang and other places, involving countless people, most of whom were killed.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Verdicts of Japanese War Criminals Should Be Finalized Soon</h3>
<p>On May 28th, Carbanto, Director of the Legal Department of General MacArthur's Headquarters in Tokyo, said: The Japanese are inherently bestial, and although temporarily suppressed, they will revert to their old ways once they are unrestrained. Americans today must not be deceived by the superficial diligence of the Japanese. Mr. Carbanto also said: Punishing Japanese war criminals is the most valuable development, because we can use this to uphold international law. Carbanto is an expert in international law and was the one who prosecuted the top-level Japanese war criminals. He made this argument seventeen months after prosecuting the Japanese war criminals, probably dissatisfied with the war crimes trials of the Far East International Military Tribunal, either because he believed that the trials were proceeding slowly or because the defendants' defense exceeded the scope. Therefore, Carbanto made this cautionary call. We believe that Carbanto's argument is clear and far-sighted, and the war crimes trials being conducted by the Far East International Tribunal also seem to have areas that should be criticized by public opinion.</p>
<p>The China War and the Pacific War launched by Japan were wars of aggression. Those who planned, instigated, or participated in the war were war criminals. This has become an unshakable conclusion for the world. It has been almost two years since Japan surrendered, and we have seen the "Far East International Military Tribunal" organize, with judges and prosecutors from China participating in the trial of Japanese war criminals. Regarding the arrest of war criminals, after the Allied forces entered Japan, on September 12 of the year before last, there was the arrest of 39 people, including Hideki Tojo, and the arrest of 7 people, including Ryohei Uchida, leader of the Black Dragon Society, and Hashimoto Kingoro. On September 21, there was the arrest of Doihara Kenji. On November 17, there was the arrest of 11 people, including Sadao Araki. On December 1, there was the arrest of 59 people, including Kiichiro Hiranuma. On December 6, there was the arrest of 9 people, including Koichi Kido. From January 23 to July 26 last year, there was the arrest of 93 people, including Yuichiro Nagano. The Prosecutor's Office of the Far East International Tribunal submitted the "Indictment of Japanese Class A War Criminals" a year ago, accusing 28 people, including Araki, Doihara, Hirota, Matsui, Tojo, Itagaki, Umezu, Shigemitsu, of crimes against peace, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and joint planning or conspiracy, listing 54 counts of charges. The submission of this indictment was earlier than the Nuremberg International Tribunal's judgment on Nazi war criminals, but the trial of Japanese war criminals only began for the first time on June 3 last year. It has been a year now, and it has only just gone through the stage of questioning witnesses, and now it is in the debate stage. According to Judge Webb, the presiding judge, if the trial is accelerated, it can be completed by the end of this year. In fact, the trial time is increasingly delayed, and the defendants' arguments and evidence are becoming more and more favorable, and the political significance of punishing war criminals is gradually disappearing. Those who are wise are certainly not satisfied with the slow pace of the trial of Japanese war criminals.</p>
<p>The procrastination of the Far East International Tribunal is manifested in the fact that Yosuke Matsuoka and Osami Nagano died of illness while in custody, Koki Hirota escaped prosecution by feigning madness, and the adoption of "cross-examination." The so-called cross-examination, also known as "opposing questioning," means that the lawyers of all levels of the accused can question witnesses, and they will refute the witness based on reason for anything that is beneficial to the accused, in order to seek exoneration from their own crimes. This kind of "cross-examination" is a characteristic of the Anglo-American legal system. When Qin Decun and Powell testified last year, the 54 Japanese and American defense lawyers of the accused did not fail to use "cross-examination" to do their best to confuse black and white and use clever words to evade responsibility. Other things, such as the attitude of the presiding judge, also caused the trial to be full of side issues, which made the prosecutors feel uncomfortable. For example, on August 6 last year, when American prosecutor Morrow presented the indictment of the Japanese invasion of China on behalf of the prosecution team, he accused the 28 war criminals of being fully responsible for the acts of aggression and atrocities. Presiding Judge Webb actually said: "Who can prove that the Chinese army fought against Japan in an unprecedented war?" He also said: "Who can prove that the actions of the Japanese army were more ferocious than those of the Huns?" Because of the attitude of the presiding judge and the severe criticism of the prosecutor's indictment, during a trial on April 22 this year, the American lawyer of Tojo actually said that "what Tojo and others have said for many years is exactly the same as Truman's position," to argue that Japan's aggression was due to fear of the spread of communism. Although the American lawyer's remarks were to protect the interests of the accused, it is inevitable that they went beyond the general rules. All of this is enough to make the trial of Japanese war criminals take a long time. We are really dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Some people think that carefully trying war criminals will be beneficial to the authenticity of history, and that Japan's conspiracy of aggression can be completely and frankly revealed to future generations. This hope is wrong. It is difficult to obtain credible information from the trials of Tojo, Minami Jiro, and others who are cunning and stubborn, and Doihara, Matsui, Umezu, and others who are tricky and sinister. Moreover, the more time is delayed, the more beneficial it will be to the war criminals. Therefore, the long-term trial of the Far East International Tribunal is an unnecessary method and should be revised quickly. Therefore, we advocate that the war crimes trials should be completed as soon as possible, that the verdicts of all important war criminals should be finalized as soon as possible, and that they should be subjected to criminal law, so as not to cause the world to doubt the Allied forces' ruling policies. Moreover, it is even more important that Class A war criminals Doihara, Umezu, Matsui, and others, and "secondary war criminals" such as Kagesa who are in custody, have committed heinous crimes in China. For the convenience of collecting evidence of their crimes, it is necessary to extradite them to China for trial. We make this argument not out of a desire for revenge against Doihara, Matsui, and other criminals, but to establish and consolidate the principle of international law, which is: "Wars of aggression are crimes."</p>
<p>In short, the trial of Japanese war criminals in recent years has not only been slow in terms of time, consuming manpower and financial resources, but also seems to be frequently losing sight of the purpose of the trial. Carbanto pointed out that punishing Japanese war criminals is to uphold international law, which is a clear argument. We believe that in order to safeguard the solemnity of international law and to implement the principle that "wars of aggression are crimes," we have the right to demand that the verdicts of Japanese war criminals be finalized as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>Communists Intending to Usurp Power, Coup d'état Occurs in Hungary, Nagy Resigns, Dinnyés Succeeds as Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 31st] The Hungarian cabinet held a special meeting this morning and decided to resign en masse. Prime Minister Nagy had tendered his resignation earlier.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 30th] Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, leader of the Smallholders Party, who has been vacationing in Bern, Switzerland, submitted his resignation today to the Hungarian legation in Switzerland, which will forward it to the Hungarian government. It is reported that the Soviet Union had accused Prime Minister Nagy of participating in an anti-republican conspiracy in Hungary a few days ago. Therefore, the Hungarian government telegraphed Prime Minister Nagy, instructing him to return to the country immediately. However, well-informed sources here believe that he will remain in Switzerland and does not intend to return.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Budapest, 31st] The Hungarian cabinet announced today that Army Minister Dinnyés (46 years old) has been appointed Prime Minister, succeeding Nagy's vacancy. Dinnyés is a famous Hungarian soccer player who only held the rank of sergeant during the war. A few months ago, when the Communists expelled Army Chief Bassa and other officials, Dinnyés was appointed Army Chief. The cabinet also announced that Ambassador to Italy Kossa has been transferred to Foreign Minister, replacing Gyöngyösi. Before Kossa returns to the country, the Minister of Information, Mihály, will temporarily replace him. Gyöngyösi advocated for close ties with Western countries, leading to opposition from various left-wing parties. It is reported that Hungary will hold new general elections in September. It is widely rumored that after the Communists forced Nagy to resign, they turned to pressure President Tildy to comply. Until this morning, the Communists had been considering the former president of the National Bank, Ottványi, but at the last minute, a telegram from the Soviet Union rejected him, and Ottványi's hope of becoming Prime Minister vanished. The real reason for the Soviet action is still unclear, but it is rumored in parliamentary circles that this is because Ottványi's ancestors were German and he had worked in the Hungarian Army intelligence unit against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Budapest, 31st] The Hungarian constitutional police are conducting a new investigation into the rebellion case, and several people have been arrested. It is expected that more people will be arrested. The personal secretary of the resigned Prime Minister Nagy, Kapok, was arrested today. According to the police, they found a letter from Nagy's daughter, Julia, in Kapok's possession, which stated, "Next time, use the code I am sending you now." The letter proves that Nagy continued to contact underground activities from Switzerland using coded letters. The police also stated that the evidence found proves that Nagy regularly used company funds owned by the Smallholders Party to support traitors.</p>
<h3>Political Turmoil in Italy Comes to an End, New Cabinet to Be Announced Within Days, Socialist and Communist Parties Excluded</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 30th] Officials have just announced that the new Italian Prime Minister, leader of the Christian Democratic Party Gasperi, has formed an all-Christian Democratic cabinet, only recruiting some non-partisan figures as "experts" to participate in the new cabinet. Thus, Gasperi has successfully ended the political turmoil in Italy. The position of Foreign Minister is still held by Sforza. The current new government not only marks the end of the tripartite coalition situation in Italy, but also prevents the cooperation between the Christian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party from continuing. Prime Minister Gasperi visited President Nicola at 7:30 PM today and submitted the list of ministers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 30th] Political observers have just commented that the exclusion of the Italian Socialist and Communist parties from the new cabinet may lead to renewed political and social unrest throughout the country. The extreme left-wing parties are actively opposing Christian Democratic Prime Minister Gasperi. The Communist Party has already announced that it will hold meetings in various places.</p>
<h3>U.S. Unlikely to Submit Large-Scale Foreign Aid to Congress Again, Said Democratic Senator George</h3>

<h3>Panic in Budapest, People Withdraw Money from Banks</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 30th] A dispatch from Budapest says: Following the most serious government crisis in Hungary since the end of the war, the situation in Budapest is panicking, with long lines of depositors withdrawing money in front of various banks. It is rumored that Kovacs, the secretary-general of the Hungarian Smallholders Party who was previously arrested by the Soviet army, has confessed that Prime Minister Nagy, Speaker of Parliament Varga, and Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi all participated in treasonous conspiracies. After the Soviet Union revealed this confession, it triggered the outbreak of the political crisis.</p>
<p>French Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Regarding the political turmoil in Hungary, French political figures commented that this was due to the failure of the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow. As the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union gradually deteriorates, both are trying their best to consolidate their positions in Eastern and Western Europe before autumn. Hungary has now become the center of political means. The Soviet Union's actions are aimed at eliminating the Hungarian Smallholders Party, which currently holds the majority, in order to put the Communist Party in a favorable position.</p>
<p>U.S. and U.K. Pay Attention</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] American sources believe that the demise of young Hungarian democracy and its transformation into a communist police state similar to Soviet-affiliated countries in Eastern Europe is due to a Soviet conspiracy coup. Nagy was the only leader who finally opposed the Communist Party. Diplomatic circles say that Hungary has effectively followed the countries of Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, and Albania into the arms of the Soviet Union. U.S. decision-makers have cancelled weekend vacations and are working extra hours, and may lodge a protest with the Soviet Union, urge the United Nations to conduct an investigation, and suspend economic assistance to Hungary when the Communists take over.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 31st broadcast: A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the British government believes that the recent events in Hungary show that the Communist Party does have an attempt to seize power. When asked by a reporter whether the British side would recognize Hungary if a Communist regime were established, the British spokesperson said that this issue is under consideration.</p>

<h3>Iran Requests Loan from U.S., Totaling 55 Million US Dollars, Aiming to Modernize Iranian Army</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] It has just been learned from here that Iran has requested a military loan of 30 million US dollars from the United States to modernize its army and gendarmerie. At the same time, Iran is also negotiating with the State Department to borrow a commercial loan of 25 million US dollars to carry out its domestic seven-year reconstruction plan. The leader of the U.S. delegation to Iran, Schwartzkopf, has returned to the United States to discuss the military loan. According to Schwartzkopf, the Iranian army of 100,000 and the gendarmerie of 24,000 now need Chinese equipment, namely motor transport vehicles, trucks, weapons transport vehicles, armored vehicles, tanks, jeeps, etc. In addition, wireless radios, telephones, mobile walkie-talkies, wires, etc., are also needed. Although Iran needs weapons and ammunition, it needs non-military supplies even more. Iran is still worried about the threat from the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet-backed Azerbaijan regime has disintegrated, the problem of the underground fifth column has not been resolved. Regarding Iran's economic situation, Iran is now planning to first borrow 25 million US dollars from the International Bank to support its economic institutions. The roads, railways, and airplanes built by Iran during the war have all been badly damaged and need to be repaired with loans to maintain transportation between major cities. In addition, expanding its irrigation system also requires funds to realize.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Council held its third plenary meeting yesterday afternoon, discussing proposals on hygiene, public works, and public utilities. At the same time, Speaker Pan reported on the inspection of district administration and the opinions of various districts hoping to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the guidance of the student unrest case, according to the decisions of the special committee organized by Deputy Speaker Xu and other 17 people, the大会修正通过平息学潮所采取之行动决议三点, (见告学生书内) passed the modified resolutions to appease the student unrest (see letter to students) and issued a letter to the students of this city as follows:</p>
<p>Students, when the third meeting of this council opened, you were striking because you were dissatisfied with the current situation and were injured for striking. We are all moved by your spirit of self-sacrifice. At the same time, we also think that the current political corruption, economic downturn, war, and people's lack of livelihood. This unreasonable phenomenon has caused your worries and anger, so that you cannot study with peace of mind. This is the joint responsibility of the government authorities and the opposition parties. But you must know that many current political problems, internal efforts, cannot be successful all at once. So you should stand up to awaken the society and pay attention to these issues and jointly seek solutions, but you should not be too emotional and seek temporary pleasure, causing more complicated disputes, or even causing strikes and strikes, to sacrifice society. This kind of behavior, even if the motivation is very pure, will lose the sympathy of most people. You only need to read the letter to students and the government by 102 professors from Peking University and Tsinghua University, such as Qian Ruisheng and Zhang Xiruo, published in the May 30th newspaper, and you should understand that everyone does not approve of your approach. Now the government has accepted your requirements, and those that cannot be resolved for a while are also considering practical and feasible solutions; you should stop at the right time, immediately resume classes automatically, work hard, and wait for the situation to improve. We believe that the situation will definitely improve. If you continue to strike, or even go out on a large scale on June 2, then when society demands stability, when the government cracks down on demonstrations, and when unscrupulous people want to take the opportunity to cause trouble, you will definitely lose the sympathy of society and reduce your own reputation, and may even unfortunately develop into a bloody tragedy. These are not alarmist and must be seriously noted.</p>
<h3>Three Resolutions</h3>
<p>Regarding the actions taken by Mayor Wu Xuansiling on May 30 to quell the student unrest, this council, for the sake of protecting young people, has solemnly resolved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Notify the government not to implicate and stop all unnecessary educational measures to effectively protect the safety of students. (2) For those arrested students whose circumstances are relatively minor, the government should be asked to promptly entrust their schools or parents to manage and educate them outside of custody. For those whose circumstances are more serious, if there is a need for custody and investigation before the student unrest subsides, the state should still be asked to give them preferential treatment in the spirit of protecting young people, without being harsh. After the student unrest subsides in the future, they should still be entrusted to their schools or parents for management and education and should not be sent to CCP areas. (3) For other young people arrested because of this student unrest, the government should be asked to handle them in the same way, referring to the above-mentioned meaning. Now we represent the good citizens of the whole city, represent your parents who love and discuss you, and earnestly ask you to resume classes as soon as possible, and stop demonstrations and demonstrations, so as not to add to the turmoil, deepen the suffering of this city, and trigger potential crises. Sincerely tell you, please think twice, Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>At this time, a professor claimed that several of the students the authorities wanted to arrest usually had excellent grades and were about to graduate, and asked the mayor to be lenient in accordance with his love for young people. The mayor agreed to follow the resolution of the Municipal Council and entrust those with lighter offenses to the school or parents for supervision and education, while those with more serious offenses would be dealt with after the matter was over. As for the students who have already been arrested, they will be treated favorably, and the school and parents can rest assured.</p>

After reviewing the defendant's counterclaim reasons, Judge Wang Weicheng of the District Court determined that they were insufficient to hold Gui Yongqing criminally liable and ruled to dismiss the case. The main text of the ruling was: "The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed, and the costs of the lawsuit shall be borne by the plaintiff."</p>
<h3>Party Chief Fang Issues Statement, Hopes for Four Points on Student Unrest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] Municipal Party Chief Fang issued a statement yesterday on the student unrest, stating: The recent arrest of illegal communist elements by the government should not be confused with the student unrest issue. Since the withdrawal of the Chinese Communist Party, many of its underground workers lurking in the city have mixed in schools, relying on their "underground struggle wrinkles" to wantonly disrupt social order and attempt to create social terror and chaos. In order to stabilize the locality and schools, the government should arrest these troublemakers according to law. The student unrest began in early May, originally due to internal problems in various schools, but later merged and evolved into a political movement, and it is not difficult to imagine that it was manipulated and instigated by others. Having engaged in school administration and educational administration for many years, I would like to express my sincere hope to all parties for the peaceful resolution of this student unrest from the standpoint of an educator. (A) On the part of the principals: The government's arrest of the main troublemakers in the various schools is precisely to assist the school authorities in seeking stability. The school authorities should cooperate with the government's measures, seek to restore normalcy as soon as possible, and not be passive, which will only increase the complexity of the problem. (B) On the part of the professors: Even if they have to express sympathy and concern for the arrested students due to the relationship between teachers and students, they cannot only care about a few arrested students and ignore the majority of students who hope for stability and resumption of classes. They should try their best to persuade the students to resume classes as soon as possible, so as to avoid the suffering of prolonged strikes for thousands of pure and studious young people. (C) On the part of the students: The student unrest should be thoroughly reviewed to recognize the conspiracy of the Chinese Communist Party. Now that the horses of the book group have been removed, I hope that the students of the various schools will no longer give the conspirators a chance to take advantage of them and cause long-term chaos. I especially hope that they will resume classes immediately in order to seek the stability of the school. (D) On the part of the parents: I hope that they can sympathize with the government's painful and severe measures and exhort their children to resume classes immediately and work hard in their studies. Finally, Fang said that what we need now is stability, and what the Chinese Communist Party has been creating for months is chaos and terror. Recently, it has attempted to direct a tragedy of "three strikes and one tragedy" on "June 2." All citizens should jointly prevent this conspiracy to disrupt public order. Understanding this, we should also work together to quickly resolve the student unrest in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Council Meeting Discusses Proposals, Single-Person Rickshaw Case Reserved, Request the Executive Yuan to Approve Unified Management of Domestic Telephone Institutions, Intended to Allow Merchants to Build Crematoriums in Appropriate Locations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At yesterday's Municipal Council meeting, various proposals were discussed. Regarding public utilities, the case of "Requesting the Municipal Government to prohibit single-seat rickshaws within a time limit or to widen the dimensions to ensure passenger safety" was discussed quite enthusiastically. In particular, many opinions were raised on the first item of the method: "Before June 20, all single-seat rickshaws should be changed to double-seat, or the standard dimensions that meet safety standards should be widened, otherwise they will be restored to yellow rickshaws." As a result, the majority passed this case to be "reserved." According to Pang Jingzhou: (1) Changing single-seat to double-seat will further hinder traffic. (2) The Council has already resolved to remodel yellow rickshaws, and now wants to restore them, which seems inappropriate. (3) Who will bear the cost of remodeling is still vague. Chen Peide also believes that it is not rickshaws but large trucks that hinder traffic. Fei Shusheng also advocated reservation, and said that from the standpoint of some people, rickshaws are still an important means of transportation, do not hinder traffic, while motor vehicles often do not drive according to the rules, causing many accidents. Regarding the case of "In order to improve the Shanghai domestic telephone system, it is proposed to request the Municipal Government to forward it to the Executive Yuan for speedy approval of a unified management of Shanghai domestic telephones in order to facilitate expansion and meet the needs of the citizens," it was passed to request the Municipal Government to submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval of the unified management institution, and to send it to the Public Utilities Bureau to instruct the telephone company to pay special attention to improvement. There are other public utility cases that will be discussed at tomorrow's meeting.</p>

(3) "Please rectify the cleanliness of the lanes, and strictly prohibit residents from randomly dumping garbage, in order to emphasize hygiene," Method: Please ask the Municipal Police Bureau to regularly send personnel to inspect the cleanliness of the lanes, and post notices in the lanes in advance, not only residents are not allowed to pour feces into the boxes, but also those who urinate everywhere or dump garbage outside the boxes must be strictly prohibited, and investigate the responsibility and strictly enforce penalties on the households that violate the regulations. (4) Feces trucks hinder hygiene, please order the Health Bureau to notify and improve the case. Passed.

<h3>Open Pudong Highway</h3>
<p>Regarding public works: The passed motions included: (1) "The Pudong Chu Pudong highway wharf should be planned and gradually opened as soon as possible, so that the eastern part of the city can be developed equally with Yongxi," the case was sent to the Municipal Government to handle in accordance with the urgency. (2) The stinking ditch embankment smells bad, which hinders the appearance and hygiene, and endangers the lives of women and children. It is proposed to ask the government to fill it up as soon as possible to shock the public. (3) Please build Kangle Road, Anting Road, and North Xizang Road, etc. as soon as possible.

<h3>Elementary School Students Have Extraordinary Ambitions, Fly to the United States, Learn Aviation, Seven People Go Out Together Rashly, Fooled by Others, Fortunately Discovered</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tang Zhixiang, a 14-year-old student from Hengmao Elementary School in Zhimao Lane, South Tibet Road, recently heard rumors from passers-by that the United States has a "Sino-American Juvenile Air Force School" that is currently recruiting, etc. Tang immediately believed it to be true, and then vigorously promoted it in the school. His classmates Chen Guirong (14 years old), Xia Zhenze (16 years old), Gao Zhiqiang (13 years old), Lan Jipei (15 years old), Yang Xianghui (12 years old), and Ge Jinkai (13 years old) all expressed their agreement. They agreed to set off the day before yesterday afternoon, planning to go to the Jiangwan Airport to take a plane to the United States to apply for the school. Unexpectedly, when they passed through the Hongkou area, the sky was already late, so the seven children went to the Xinzhengyang Inn, Room 7, on Qiujiang Road to stay overnight. Late at night, a volunteer policeman came to inspect the room and suddenly found these seven children to be suspicious. He immediately inquired about the situation and learned that they had been fooled. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Songshan Police Station for their parents to come to the case to claim them. However, according to Tang Zhixiang: My sister is now working as a waitress in the Dashin Company. She knows an air force man named Zhang Chunming. I plan to go to Jiangwan Airport and ask him to introduce me to learn how to be a pilot in the United States, etc. The other children all claimed that they were fooled by Tang Zhixiang. Before setting off, they all concealed it from their parents. Before leaving, Tang Zhixiang left a letter to his parents, which read: "Dear parents... It has been fourteen years since I have been with you. You gave birth to me and raised me to adulthood, and you are very good to me. I will not forget your parents' kindness. I know that the country is now very strong. Why don't we go and contribute to the country? Now I hear people say that the United States has a self-reliant Air Force Juvenile School. I also want to collect some American characters and English. I hope my parents don't cry. As soon as I arrive in the United States, I will send a telegram back home. Please don't miss me. I wish you good health. Your son Zhixiang pays his respects."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Conscription Begins in July, Number May Be Reduced to 3,000</h3>
<p>Commander Chuan Zhengmo of the Shanghai Garrison District went to Beijing to participate in a military officer training class and returned to Shanghai on the morning of the 30th. According to Chuan yesterday, regarding conscription matters, the Ministry of National Defense has ordered all localities to start today. Due to Shanghai's special circumstances, the preparatory work has not been completed as scheduled. Generally, it will be postponed by one month compared to other regions. As for the conscription quota, it is generally determined by the population ratio. According to this standard, Shanghai should originally conscript about 4,000 people, but after requesting a reduction, it may be approved for 3,000 people. In order to handle new recruits' training matters, the Garrison District will establish a replacement corps, but the candidates have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Zhan Liansheng's Application for Release on Bail in the Gold Rush Case Rejected</h3>
<p>District Court Sends Letter to National Bank to Investigate Accounts</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhan Liansheng, the director of the Gold Industry Association, has been detained for two months due to the Gold Rush case. Recently, Zhan applied for release on bail on the grounds that he was old and suffered from asthma and stomach problems, and that the defendants Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren in the same case were all released on bail. However, the application was rejected yesterday by Judge Wang Jiazhuo, who was in charge of the case.</p>
<p>Regarding the detailed verification of the accounts related to the Gold Rush case, the District Court sent an official letter to the Central Bank yesterday to investigate the bank's gold, foreign exchange, and cash accounts, the Audit Office's gold review report, and the cashier's office's new accounting books, in order to investigate whether the three defendants Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng in the Gold Rush case colluded with officials and engaged in corruption and malpractice.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhuchen Not Allowed to Be Released on Bail</h3>

<h3>Report by the Speaker on His Inspection of District Administration; Twelve Issues Awaiting Resolution Submitted for Assembly Discussion and Reference</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] City Council Speaker Pan yesterday reported to the Council Assembly on his district administration symposium held from May 2nd to 9th and his inspection of district administration from the 17th to the 25th. He summarized twelve issues in the city that need immediate resolution, providing them for discussion and reference at this assembly. The Speaker's report and suggestions elicited enthusiastic applause from all councilors, who also proposed a motion to express their appreciation to the Speaker. Additionally, a resolution was passed to have the Municipal Government Policy Report Review Committee jointly review the report. The twelve most pressing issues requested by each district, as provided by the Speaker, are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) The powers and status of the District People's Representative Assemblies and the District Public Offices should be clearly and definitively established as soon as possible to lay the foundation for local autonomy. Although the powers of the District People's Representative Assemblies are clearly stipulated in the City Organization Law, they have no financial power, and therefore all resolutions on matters to be promoted or reformed cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>Define the District as a Legal Entity</p>
<p>It seems appropriate to define the district as a legal entity with its own financial power, and to grant the District People's Representative Assembly financial oversight authority. As for the powers and status of the District Public Offices, could the Municipal Government be requested to, in accordance with Article 34 of the City Organization Law, consolidate all branches of the Municipal Government's bureaus in each district into the District Public Offices, enriching each district? It is also hoped that a decision can be made on this. The business related to each bureau will still be directed and supervised by the respective departments.</p>
<p>Allocate Office Space</p>
<p>(2) Office space for the District People's Representative Assemblies, District Public Offices, and various Bao (neighborhood units) should be resolved as soon as possible. In my opinion, the police stations in the former concession areas are all high-rise buildings, are also municipal public property, and are part of the Municipal Government. Could a way be found to readjust them? If the police stations could spare a small portion of their buildings, the office space for the District People's Representative Assemblies and District Public Offices in more than ten districts could be resolved. As for Zhabei, Nanshi, and the suburbs, separate construction should be planned. For Bao offices, it seems that three to six Bao could rent civilian houses or allocate idle public housing to establish a joint Bao office, centralize operations, and simplify the staff.</p>
<p>(3) Boundary demarcation issues should be resolved quickly: In the city's Dachang District, Zhudi Town in the Xinjing District, and Qibao and Xinzhuang in the Longhua District, administrative chaos and disputes arise frequently due to the undefined administrative areas. These issues should be resolved quickly in accordance with the original plan of 1927, in consultation with the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Planning for Drinking Water for the Poor</p>
<p>(4) The drinking water problem in impoverished areas should be resolved quickly: In the slum areas of western Shanghai and the Yulin District of Yangshupu, as well as in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong, not only is there no tap water for drinking, but it is also difficult to obtain river water, and people are forced to draw water from foul creeks. If an epidemic breaks out, it will inevitably spread throughout the city. The Municipal Government should quickly plan to install tap water pipes, set up public water stations, or drill artesian wells and disinfect the water for the poor to drink.</p>
<p>(5) The problem of water and electricity supply in the suburbs and the determination of main road routes should be planned quickly: The central area of the city is densely populated and can no longer accommodate growth. Experts say that development should be directed towards the suburbs. However, to develop the suburbs, it is necessary to first develop suburban transportation, roads, and water and electricity supply, so that suburban transportation is convenient and living is comfortable, comparable to the city center. Then, people will naturally move to the suburbs without needing to be driven.</p>
<p>Roads Should Be Repaired Quickly</p>
<p>(6) Roads in various districts of the city are severely damaged and should be repaired quickly: The roads in various districts of the city have been damaged over the past eight years. Although repairs have been made since the victory, the roads are over 800 kilometers long, and the city treasury is strained, making it difficult to fully repair even the major thoroughfares. The roads in other districts are simply rugged and impassable. How can public support be mobilized to assist in the repair?</p>
<p>(7) The problem of garbage and excrement in the city should be resolved quickly: In various districts of the city, piles of garbage and excrement are often seen, the air is filled with foul odors, and mosquitoes and flies swarm, which is a source of epidemics. Quick and effective solutions should be sought.</p>
<p>(8) The construction of illegal buildings and shacks should be guided and controlled: Everywhere in the city, houses are being built indiscriminately on public and private land, regardless of property rights. This not only makes fire prevention difficult, but also obstructs traffic and clogs sewers and waterways. The government should be urged to quickly develop effective measures to designate public land to guide the poor in building shacks, and to control shacks that obstruct traffic and public drainage.</p>
<p>Increase Ferry Service</p>
<p>(9) Ferry services should be increased between Puxi and Pudong to improve transportation: Transportation between Puxi and Pudong currently relies solely on ferries. However, there is only one ferry terminal. It seems appropriate to add several ferry terminals at major docks, operating on both sides of the river, to facilitate transportation and promote the prosperity of Pudong.</p>
<p>(10) The occupation of land for the four airports and the civilian land, houses, and warehouses forcibly seized by central government agencies in Shanghai from the enemy and puppets should be cleared up quickly: Land for the airports should be requisitioned and compensated, and other civilian land, houses, and warehouses should be returned to maintain property rights and ensure the safety of the people.</p>
<p>(11) Floating shacks in the suburbs should be cleared up quickly: Floating shacks are all over the suburbs, and the poor build houses next to them. This is not only unhygienic, but also spreads epidemics. The government should quickly develop effective measures to clear them up.</p>
<p>(12) Land for schools in each district that are being dedicated should be allocated quickly: When Chairman Chiang celebrated his 60th birthday last year, this council launched a campaign to dedicate schools to celebrate his birthday, with the aim of popularizing compulsory education as soon as possible. Each district organized committees and raised funds separately. However, land for schools in each district has not yet been allocated, causing work to stagnate. The Municipal Government should quickly allocate public land to be used for schools in order to complete the project.</p>
<h3>Drunken Man Sets Fire Because He Hates His Mistress for Not Coming Home; Seeks Death Regardless of Public Safety, Claiming Life is Meaningless</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The District Procuratorate yesterday conducted a preliminary investigation into a bizarre "endangering public safety" crime, which is quite laughable. A certain Huang Qi, about fifty years old, who works as a messenger at the Central Bank, lives at No. 302, Dihua Middle Road. His mistress runs a Meiji cigarette paper store, and Huang is very resentful because she has unchaste behavior outside. Around 11 p.m. on May 26th, Huang returned to the store drunk and, seeing that his mistress had still not returned, conceived the idea of ​​committing suicide. He then set fire to oily paper scraps and cloth, and thick smoke penetrated into the house of Qiao Rujia, a resident of the pavilion. Qiao woke up in fright and woke up the tenants upstairs and downstairs, including Huang Shisu, who opened Huang's door and used water to extinguish the fire, luckily preventing a major disaster. Qiao and others, angry that Huang's personal grievances endangered public safety, took him to the police station, which transferred him to the District Procuratorate on charges of "endangering public safety." Yesterday, Prosecutor Yu Xin summoned the plaintiffs Qiao Rujia, Huang Tulian, Zhu Shenqian, Ma Shaoning, Zhou Datong, Yao Shouqi, Chen Zhihao, Xu Huichuan, Jin Zongpei, Ji Chengan, and others. Huang's mistress did not appear in court. According to the defendant, he had been resentful for a long time because his mistress often went out and did not return, and happened to be drunk that night, so he had the idea of ​​committing suicide. The prosecutor asked why he had to set fire to commit suicide, wouldn't that endanger the safety of others? Huang said that he felt that the world was meaningless, so he might as well set a fire and perish together. Prosecutor Yu said that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Caohhejing Tenants Association Requests Standard Rent Prices</h3>
<p>The Caohhejing Tenants Association stated that the houses rented by the people in the area are mostly priced by the meter, and the current price of rice is soaring, making the burden unbearable. Therefore, they sent representatives to negotiate with the Longhua District Public Office, requesting that a standard rental price be negotiated to provide some relief. Vice District Chief Yang expressed his agreement to temporarily stipulate that all rents calculated by the meter should be based on the cost of living index, or calculated at a public price of 168,000 yuan per dan of rice, and agreed to convene landlords to educate them to avoid incidents.</p>
<h3>First Sino-American Flight</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The first China National Aviation Corporation aircraft on the Sino-American route, a DC-4 type "Sky Master", flew out of Jiangwan Airport at 9 a.m. yesterday, carrying twenty-five Chinese and foreign passengers bound for Honolulu and San Francisco, as well as a batch of mail to the United States. The China National Aviation Corporation has been test-flying the Sino-American route twice before, with satisfactory results. This time, it is still nominally a test flight, because the official opening date has yet to be announced simultaneously with Pan American Airways of the United States.</p>
<h3>Vendetta for Killing His Younger Brother; Came to Shanghai to Buy Goods; Bumped into Him and Took Him into Custody</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Huang Guanxiong, from Taixing, currently works at the Central Electric Bead Factory at No. 3, Lane 254, Chengdu Road. At 4 p.m. on the 25th of last month, he followed his fellow villager Zhou Zhongyuan and, passing the west entrance of Lane Lilin next to Chengdu Road, called the police and took him to the Xincheng Police Station, reporting that Zhou Zhongyuan had served as a member of the Security Committee of the New Fourth Army in his hometown. On one occasion, Zhou gambled with Huang's younger brother Guanfan, and Zhou lost but did not pay on the spot. Huang's younger brother repeatedly demanded payment, which caused Zhou to harbor resentment. Finally, at 5 p.m. on the 25th day of the eighth lunar month last year, Zhou led four or five people in military uniforms and plain clothes to the fields of Nanhewan, where they shot and killed Huang's younger brother. He also claimed that Zhou was rampant in his hometown, committing all kinds of evil deeds, and that no less than thirty or forty people had been victimized. He also said that he would invite fellow villagers to come to Shanghai to testify. When questioned, Zhou Zhongyuan denied killing Huang Guanfan and serving as a member of the Security Committee of the New Fourth Army. He also said that he was a good citizen who ran a grocery store in his hometown. He came to Shanghai to buy goods and took the opportunity to visit Huang Zhou, the wife of a friend, at the Central Electric Bead Factory at No. 3, Lane 254, Chengdu Road, when he was taken to the police station by Huang. After investigation, the facts of the case were clarified and it has been submitted to the judicial authorities for trial.</p>

<h3>Demobilized Soldiers Cheat Money Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Chang Xuecheng, a demobilized unemployed soldier, 26 years old, from Hubei, lives at No. 342, Small Garden, Garden Hotel. He usually wears a suit and leather shoes, appearing to be a wealthy young man. At around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, he was wearing a coat and holding a donation book, soliciting donations from residents of a certain number on Yuyuan Road West, with an arrogant attitude. The head of the household reported this to the Changning Police Station, which ordered officer Xu Xian to rush to the scene and bring him to the station for questioning. It was found that someone had already pledged to donate 35,000 yuan in his donation book. According to Yang, he has been unemployed and has no way to make a living, so he falsely borrowed the name of a certain charity to solicit donations. He has successively solicited more than 4 million yuan, which he has spent. The sub-bureau sentenced him to seven days of imprisonment in accordance with the law on obstructing police affairs as a warning.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Student Organizations United to Launch Patriotic and School Protection Movement; Sent Representatives to Shanghai Yesterday to Host Reporters Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Ten representatives from the Nanjing Student Organizations United Patriotic and School Protection Student Association arrived in Shanghai yesterday. These representatives, in order to launch a patriotic and school protection movement, are scheduled to host reporters at the New Life Club at 3 p.m. today to make a report. The association has written to the National Government, explaining that the students of Nanjing Central University and other schools initially demanded that the government increase public funds, but were exploited by the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League, triggering a violent student movement, demanding that the government strictly enforce the law and stabilize the people's hearts, and inviting the Chinese Communist Party delegates to come to Nanjing immediately to attend the National Political Council and restore peace talks. The association also has "A Letter to the National Political Council", "A Letter to the Chinese Communist Party", and "A Letter to the Democratic League", urging the Chinese Communist Party to stop all inflammatory and destructive political struggles, and hoping that the Democratic League will truly withdraw from schools.</p>
<p>The Association's Declaration is Explored as Follows:</p>
<p>"After repeated consideration, we can no longer remain silent in the face of the truth; we abandon sentiment, and under the encouragement of justice, we must roar out the voice of our hearts. The current motherland is in extreme hardship. People start from different positions and shout out their own pain from different perspectives of interest and harm. The facts of bitterness and hardship are placed before hearts permeated with fresh blood for judgment, and ugly crimes are heavily eroding the soul of society. With each stimulus and swing, the foundation of the Chinese nation is shaking. But who is supporting this shaken foundation? Who is saving this raging torrent that is running wild? Looking at the countries of the world after the war, the painful lessons of war have forced the people of each country to strengthen their national consciousness, and the people of each country have sacrificed their prejudices and biases, seeking public happiness within the scope of the country. But, looking at our country again, people are displaced everywhere, society is in turmoil everywhere, and high prices and the pain of civil war are heavily pressing on everyone's heart. The recent student movement is undoubtedly a legitimate reform demanded by some students regarding the current situation. At the same time, it is also undeniable that some people are taking the opportunity to incite, seeking to create social chaos and promote the collapse of the government. But legitimate reform must seek progress under stable conditions, and the attempt to create chaos and overthrow the government is really a conspiracy to overturn the country and destroy society. Moreover, under the current difficult situation in the country, is it necessary to resort to strikes and parades to make reasonable demands? We cannot bear to see studies being increasingly abandoned, and we cannot bear to see the form of turmoil increasingly expanding. Our fellow students have formed the Patriotic and School Protection Student Association, adhering to the purpose of loving the country and protecting schools, and sincerely appealing, and we are determined to carry out our purpose with action. We hereby put forward our propositions as follows: (1) Looking at the current situation of the student movement, it seems that students and the government are standing on opposing positions, and this concept must be corrected immediately. We believe that the government should adopt the reasonable demands of students, and the government should guide the excessive demands of students. Students themselves should know the big picture, take care of the overall situation, take studies as the foundation, and take self-love as the priority. (2) All parties should no longer use students as tools for political struggle; at the same time, students should follow reason, distinguish right from wrong, so as not to be exploited by ambitious people in secret. (3) The Communist Party must give the country an opportunity to recuperate and give up the attempt to seize power by force. Other parties must also abandon prejudices and jointly plan for national affairs. (4) People from all walks of life in society must understand the difficulties of the times and avoid social turmoil, so as not to shake the foundation of the country. At the same time, they must stimulate just public opinion and maintain national peace in the process of realizing political democracy. (5) While the international situation still allows China to engage in construction, the people of the whole country should denounce any destructive behavior and mobilize the power of the whole people to actively build the country."</p>

<h3>After the Financial and Economic Departments' Instructions were Revealed, the Shanghai Stock Market Suffered a Great Loss, Brokers Disappointed in the Prospect of Deliveries</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of securities exchange brokers paying margin with US dollar bonds, the new instructions from the Financial and Economic Departments have been issued (see yesterday's newspaper). It is stipulated that for the part of the broker's margin that can be substituted, the US dollar bonds that are to be paid must be paid in full at 70% of their face value before the end of May this year. The same shall apply to the margin substitutes for delivery transactions. However, before the US dollar bonds are purchased, cash may be temporarily paid to offset them, but they must still be purchased by June 15th. Those who have not yet purchased them shall be offset with cash from June 1st. In addition, the deadline for purchasing the margin substitutes by the end of May has been extended to June 4th this year because the brokers have not been able to complete the procedure. As for the extension of the delivery transaction, the stock exchange has also received instructions from the departments that it is allowed to be extended for another month from the date of the document (i.e., May 30th).</p>
<h3>Directors of the Brokers Association to Visit Wang Zhixin Today</h3>
<p>The Securities Exchange Brokers Association received the official document from the stock exchange regarding this matter at around 5 pm yesterday. Several standing directors of the association immediately held a discussion meeting and planned to visit Wang Zhixin, general manager of the stock exchange, this afternoon for consultations. It is reported that the brokers' opinions are as follows: (1) The new departmental instructions will not have a significant impact on the future of the stock market. The brokers are already prepared and are not as caught off guard as they were when the previous departmental order was suddenly issued. (2) The amount of delivery transactions may decrease as a result. Therefore, US dollar bonds may lack the capacity to be digested in the part of the margin substitutes for delivery transactions. The brokers also stated that it would be better to end the delivery transactions as soon as possible to reduce the pressure from the short side.</p>
<h3>Market Sentiment Scattered, Short Sellers Active</h3>

Gangshen Telegraph shrank to 13.5 yuan, and the delivery of Yongsha rebounded sharply to 7,550 yuan. Xin Guang also rose sharply under the forceful purchase of No. 152. No. 85, No. 94, No. 83, No. 199, No. 89, No. 197, No. 63, No. 154, and No. 190 sold off together. After 11 o'clock, it gradually fell to within 7,250 yuan. No. 160, No. 105, No. 180, No. 164, No. 196, and No. 109 took advantage of the low prices to advance to over 7,450 yuan. No. 141, No. 148, No. 65, No. 142, No. 89, No. 112, and No. 32 added to the sell-off, and it once fell back to 7,050 yuan. The buying interest of No. 16, No. 54, No. 106, No. 129, No. 219, and No. 23 suddenly became strong, and Xin Ya announced a limit up, with news of a capital increase, which stimulated buying interest. In addition, the rumor of parallel line banknotes rose again, and the midday close rose to 7,240 yuan. After the close, No. 13, No. 224, and No. 35 all participated, and the asking price rose to over 7,300 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Ji Yongsha, Huafeng, Qinxing, Zhongfa, and Xinhua all fell by about half a percentage point. Xinhe and Yonggong fell by 10%, Xin Guangjingfu rose slightly, Rongfeng, Zhongfang, Tongyi underwear fell by more than half a percentage point, Guohuo fell by 10%, Zhongsi rose by 10%, and Xin Ya was the only one to announce a limit up.

Outside the market, the old stocks Huashang, Nanyang, and Dasheng Three Factories were flat and tired, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Fall Back, Foreign Stocks Still Rise</h3>
<p>Government bonds fell back slightly yesterday, and high prices were difficult to sustain. Tong Bing opened at 17,000 yuan in the morning, with a low price of 14,700 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Room 360 and Room 533 purchased, while Baolong and retail investors sold. About 6.7 million transactions were made. As a result, all bonds fell compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the securities brokers in foreign stocks still purchased Yisha Jardine Matheson and Huidefeng, while the Guangdong brokers purchased British-American Tobacco. Retail investors sold, and Yisha did not move much. The rise was far less than that of British-American Tobacco. Yisha opened at 75,000 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 79,000 yuan, and hovered around 77,000 yuan near noon. As a result, compared with the previous close, British-American Tobacco alone rose by 10%, and Huide, Guang Paper, Shipping, and Steel each rose by half a percentage point. Although Yisha Kenzhi rose, it was not much.</p>

<h3>Foreign Tea Market Weak</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the export of Chinese tea has become increasingly rigid. According to people in the industry who told the reporter: At present, foreign tea prices are frequently falling, and it is heard that Egypt and other places currently have more than 1,500 tons of black tea in stock, and have ordered another 3,000 tons from the Tin Customs at a lower price. Therefore, the tea industry there has abundant reserves, and the selling price is even lower. The production cost of Chinese tea, on the other hand, is still increasing sharply in the midst of soaring prices. Looking at this situation as a whole, how can the export of Chinese tea be smooth? Yesterday, the result of the foreign tea market's consultations was still stalemate, and the transaction was tired and unable to rise. Only Jardine Matheson purchased about 200 boxes of Wuyuan Dabang from Huacheng Tea Company for the last year, at a price of 560,000 yuan per load. Although the market sentiment has not fallen, it is generally softening. The sales of other domestic teas are still available, and the market situation is continuing to stabilize due to the availability of supply, and the market is mostly the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of Guben and Arrow soap on the daily necessities market continued to rise by 4,000 yuan per case due to good sales. Guben soap was priced at 384,000 yuan per case, and Arrow soap was priced at 376,000 yuan per case. Huangxiangmao was stable, and Baixiangmao was slightly higher by 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Cigarette Market Turns Promising</h3>
<p>The cigarette market situation yesterday seemed to turn flat and tired in the morning. 10-cigarette British cigarettes hovered from 7.46 million to 400,000 yuan. The situation improved in the afternoon and finally rebounded to 7.5 million yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan from the previous day. Lao Dao was 6.5 million yuan, also continuing to rise by 25,000 yuan. The remaining Chinese cigarettes saw mixed gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Caustic Soda Shipped to Shanghai</h3>

The caustic soda and hydrochloric acid produced by the company are supplied to Taiwan Province and shipped to Shanghai for distribution. It is heard that recently, more than 200 tons of solid alkali have been shipped to Shanghai in batches. In addition to the majority of the batch being distributed to China Textile Company, general private industrial manufacturers have the right to be distributed. It is also heard that the company's personnel stationed in Shanghai said that the factories belonging to the company will gradually increase production and will be shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream. In the future, there should be no shortage of caustic soda in the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Rice Trade, Narrow Market Price Fluctuations: Four Banks Approve Loan of 176 Billion Yuan to Flour Mills</h3>
<p>The rice market experienced narrow fluctuations. Yesterday (the 31st), both North and South rice markets remained sluggish. However, influenced by rising prices of various goods, people were uneasy, and holders of goods raised market prices, turning the market from weak to firm. In the North market, white japonica rice and early thin rice were slightly pushed higher, while other indica rice showed mixed trends of falling and flat prices. In the South market, increases were more common than decreases, but milled indica rice continued its sharp decline, falling to 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving at both North and South markets was over 4,800 shi (a unit of dry measure), not including goods unloaded at the station, which need to be registered on Monday.</p>
<p>New flour supplies are approaching, and the distribution of flour is being implemented, further weakening digestion, with a drop of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Foreign flour also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran continued its downward trend, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean cakes saw activity in rural consumption, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories were actively procuring, with lively digestion, resulting in an increase of 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, up to 10,000 yuan. The oil market was initially firm but then flattened. Sesame oil saw an increase of 10,000 yuan, while refined oil and soybean oil remained unchanged. Vegetable oil was slightly firm, and crude oil maintained a firm state, with minor fluctuations.</p>
<p>Mung beans remained stagnant, and adzuki beans saw few inquiries, with a decline of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame from Southeast Asia continued to advance steadily, rising by another 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Guangdong continued to be in demand, gradually rising, with another increase of 10,000 yuan. Sorghum continued to weaken by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and corn lacked vitality. Recently, Sichuan has reported arrivals of raw peanuts and mung beans, and samples of new silk from Hankou have arrived.</p>
<p>The Fourth District Flour Industry Association, due to the emergence of new wheat and a lack of funds, submitted a document to the Four Banks Joint Treasury last week, requesting approval to issue wheat loans, and provided five principles. The Four Banks Joint Treasury reduced the proposed loan of 1.8 billion yuan for factories producing 1,000 bags per day to 1 billion yuan, with other cases following the same logic. The Association requested a loan of 320 billion yuan based on the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. According to the Four Banks' regulations, the actual amount received would be approximately 176 billion yuan, with an interest rate of 4%.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Ministry of Food has a planned production and sales plan for flour and wheat nationwide this year, which will be announced in early this month. In the future, the business of each flour mill will be based on the Four Banks Joint Treasury's loan in exchange for the mill's finished products, with a reasonable legal profit added. Under the circumstances where manufacturers have limited funds and rely on government loans, although this provision of processing on behalf of the government deprives each factory of any hope of prosperity, they still intend to accept it given the current difficult environment. The loan disbursement date will be in mid-this month, and the complete details will be notified to the industry by the Four Banks Joint Treasury next week.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Lifts Ban on Rice Transportation</h3>
<p>The food administration authorities learned that the Anhui Provincial Government has formally lifted the ban on rice grain transportation. Starting immediately, there will be no more restrictions on rice leaving the province, limited to the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Currently, rice from rice-producing areas such as Wuhu and Bengbu will be used to supply the city's food needs. In addition to the land route through the Jiangnan Railway and the transfer from Wuhu to Beijing by train to Shanghai, the water route will be handled by state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Minsheng Shipping Company and other Yangtze River steamers. It is reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company already has the Yanmin and Haiyu ships, carrying 3,000 bags of rice from Wuhu to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Ministries of Agriculture and Economics Seek to Avoid Suppressing Cocoon Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministries of Agriculture and Economics, in order to protect silkworm farmers and ensure they receive reasonable prices, and to avoid the suppression of cocoon prices, has specially stipulated the following handling methods:</p>
<p>(1) Anyone who does not comply with the standards stipulated by this committee and suppresses cocoon prices for purchase will be dealt with in accordance with these measures. (2) Based on the results of sampling and trial reeling, compare the standard discount price with the total price of fresh cocoons actually purchased. If there is a shortfall, the shortfall amount will be the amount of the suppressed cocoon price per dan (a unit of weight), and then multiply by the total amount of silkworms purchased to obtain the total amount of the suppressed cocoon price. (3) The aforementioned amount of the suppressed cocoon price shall be fully extracted and stored in a special account as funds for silkworm industry improvement. (4) The use of the industry improvement funds shall be determined by the provincial industry administrative agency to investigate the industry conditions in the original cocoon collection area, implement appropriate improvements, formulate a plan, and execute it after obtaining the approval of this committee. (5) Cocoon collection personnel who suppress cocoon prices will be dealt with separately by this committee depending on the severity of the circumstances.

The association has now appointed several experts who are in the process of drafting a detailed plan. As for our country's future shipping policy, the association also has suggestions for the government.

<h3>Jewelry Industry in Difficult Situation, Fang Tianbao Announces Closure, Jewelry Industry Requests Relief from the Mayor Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the central government promulgated emergency economic measures to suspend the distribution of gold, the jewelry industry in this city has petitioned several times, but the results have not been very satisfactory. Most jewelry stores in Beijing have voluntarily closed down. This trend has begun to spread to Shanghai. According to reporters, Fang Tianbao, a major jewelry store on Nanjing Road in this city, announced yesterday by the shareholders' meeting that it would close down on June 1st. Each employee will be given a severance payment of 1 million yuan, but the employees expressed their opposition, arguing for a severance fee of 8 million yuan per person. Because the difference between labor and management is quite large, negotiations were still in progress overnight yesterday. It is uncertain whether the store will open today. The store just opened last year and its business was still good, but since the suspension of gold distribution, the main business has been stalled, and the expenses are huge, so it has come to the point of closing down. It is heard that a large number of jewelry stores will also close down during the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>Representatives of the jewelry industry in this city, Yao Guiqing and four others, went to the city government to meet with Mayor Wu at 10:30 AM yesterday, and reported on the current difficult situation of the industry. They also stated that the industry has been virtually suspended for a long time, and the expenses such as employee salaries are huge, making it difficult to maintain this situation for a long time, and requested relief.</p>
<h3>Sharp Rise in Silk Prices After the Lifting of the Cost of Living Index Freeze, Factory-Processed Products are Firm, Rise in Artificial Silk is Moderate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise in artificial silk prices in the market had slowed down. No. 120 Takayama silk was traded at 20.1 to 22 million yuan in the morning, with the lowest bid being over 19.8 million yuan. Subsequently, due to strong buying interest, it finally rose to 30 million yuan at the close, leveling with the previous day's price. In the afternoon, a price of over 20.5 million yuan was bid. Other brands of goods did not fluctuate much. Yesterday, the market for factory-processed products remained firm. Holders of goods generally refused to sell, causing prices to rise again. Grade A products were priced at around 28 million yuan, and Grade C products were priced at 27 million yuan. Due to the tight money supply at the end of the month, no one inquired and there were no transactions. There were also no transactions in dry silk. Prices for all grades were about 1 million yuan higher than the previous day's prices. Yesterday, the China Silk Company opened 20 bales of silk, Grade D, priced at 25 million yuan, similar to the previous day's price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk prices in the market rose sharply. After the announcement of the lifting of the cost of living index freeze, labor costs increased sharply and costs increased, so both insiders and outsiders had buying interest, creating a booming situation. Meiya quilt covers were priced at 10 million yuan, and Dacheng quilt covers were priced at 9.7 million yuan, but there were few transactions in the market. The highest price for checked crepe was 36,200 yuan, but buyers were hesitant, so it dropped by 200 yuan. The final selling price was 5,900 yuan. The price for the next week was 6,300 yuan, but it did not open for trading. Prices for Shenghang and other goods also rose in the place of origin. Rayon brocade crepe was priced at 20,000 yuan in the morning. Dull spinning and striped spinning, etc., did not rise by about 10%. However, prices were too high, and formal transactions were extremely rare.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was firm because the cost of living index for workers increased, and the cost of yarn production for factories will inevitably increase in the future, so the market was firm. There was active demand in the market, and new buyers participated, causing prices to gradually rise. The price of 20-count double horse yarn was 8.65 million yuan, and double horse yarn was 7.85 million yuan, both reaching unprecedented highs. However, the trend of 42-count fine yarn was relatively sluggish. Blue Phoenix yarn rose by 450,000 yuan from the previous day to 13.65 million yuan. 20-count and 16-count yarn both rose by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially softened, because it was the weekend and the end of the month, and many floating traders were selling, and the start of spinning construction provided ample chips. The low price of 12-pound dragon head fine cloth was 325,000 yuan, but it was absorbed by the industry at a low price, and the actual needs of the customers were strong, so the price rose again. Finally, the price of dragon head fine cloth returned to 337,000 yuan, and the price of Wufu fine cloth was 320,000 yuan, continuing to rise from 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of fine cloths such as Caqiu, Blue Chicken, Yulong, and ABC also rose from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. Bleached cloth sold well, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The prices of other coarse cloth, blue cloth, and shilin cloth all rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan to 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Side View of the Tenth Meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Council: Eighteen Councilors Verbally Interrogated Continuously Like a Barrage Without a Minute of Intermission</h3>
<p>— Nanchang Dispatch, 24th - Qian Ming</p>
<p>On May 21st, the Jiangxi Provincial Council held its tenth meeting, with Civil Affairs Director Li Zhongxiang giving a policy report. After the report, over ten councilors, including Tao Han, made verbal inquiries one after another. The intensity and tension of the situation were unprecedented in previous meetings. After Mr. Li left the meeting, eleven councilors, including Tao Han, immediately made a temporary motion, stating that Director Li was suspected of dereliction of duty and should be requested by letter from the provincial government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for investigation. Due to the short time, it was hastily passed. The detailed report of the meeting before and after is as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Tension in the Conference Hall</p>
<p>Although it was early summer, the weather that day (the 21st) was even more sweltering than the dog days of summer. In the morning, the Jiangxi Provincial Council conference hall was already full of seventy or eighty councilors, guests, and reporters, and the air seemed even more sweltering. In this sweltering atmosphere, the expressions on the faces of over ten councilors were unusually tense. For the sensitive group of reporters, it seemed that they had a premonition that this meeting would not be very ordinary? Perhaps there would be exciting scenes? Everyone was welcoming the upcoming scene with nervous anticipation!</p>
<p>At 9:20 AM, Director Li was invited to the reporting platform to give a policy report. He gave a concise summary of the general business of the civil affairs department in various aspects, seemingly intending to leave more time for the councilors to ask questions.</p>
<p>After the report, many councilors stood up to speak, and the air suddenly became tense. The first to raise questions was councilor Tao Han from Jinxian. He said that Director Li had the intention of establishing factions, citing the following reasons: In recent months, the director's inspection tours seemed to have the intention of arranging elections. Secondly, he said that the township chief examination held by the Jinxian County Government this month was also related to the future elections. Thirdly, he said that his fellow villager Hu Yi (his political opponent) riding in the director's car back to the county was also illegal. When he mentioned the name Hu Yi, he seemed to have a deep hatred. Finally, he specifically explained that he had a thirty-year friendship with the director, but he would not abandon public duty for private reasons, so he gave a special word of advice. Saying this, his expression seemed to have a spirit of self-sacrifice for the sake of justice. Following Tao Han's speech were councilors Du Longyuan, Yuan Risheng, Huang Shangyuan, and Hu Dingguo. Councilor Du questioned why the corrupt Zhu Wenhua was transferred from Wan'an to Suichuan. Councilor Yuan questioned why the section chiefs and secretaries were also changed when the county magistrate changed. Councilor Huang said, why should An'yi County use someone nearly 70 years old as the secretary of the council? Councilor Hu said that the county magistrate of Xinyu County had no political acumen. After that, councilors Peng Xuezhan, Liu Guanghan, Lin Fumin, Huang Fang, Xiong Zaichi, Liu Renqiu, Xu Xiacheng, Tu Gang, and Yan Jizhi continued to speak. Councilor Peng gave opinions on the qualifications of the county magistrate and future elections. Councilor Huang, in addition to making suggestions on township production, the term of office of township chiefs, and household administration, specifically raised a question saying that Director Li was coming to take on the position of director in the capacity of a member of the Central Committee. It was rumored that he was here to arrange elections. Councilor Xiong hoped that Director Li would take a fair position to benefit Jiangxi. Councilor Xu said in a tone of emotion that Director Li now had the phenomenon of "being deserted by his followers."</p>
<p>Eighteen People Fire a Barrage</p>
<p>Amid the inquiries of the eighteen councilors rising one after another, Director Li stood on the reporting platform, listening attentively throughout. He smiled from time to time. Especially when he heard the words "Hu Yi riding in his car is illegal," "Why use someone nearly 70 years old as the county council secretary," and "Take on the position of director in the capacity of a member of the Central Committee." The eighteen people's continuous verbal inquiries were like a barrage, without a minute of intermission. Director Li began to answer each question. When he was giving his policy report, he had already spent part of the time, and the continuous verbal inquiries of the eighteen councilors occupied almost all of the prescribed time, so he had to give concise answers when answering. But just as he was about to talk about the election issue, the chairman rang the bell to urge him to finish. Although it was extended by five minutes, the answer to the question still could not be fully expressed. First, he said: "The performance evaluation of the county magistrate is jointly assessed by various departments, including education and construction. As for the recent inspection tours, they are in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of the Interior, which require inspection tours every quarter. As for township production, attention has long been paid to preventing apportionment." Just as he was saying this, Vice Chairman Wang said: "There is no need to answer one by one, please give a general summary answer." So Director Li continued to say about the election, he said, "The rumors you just heard are completely unfounded. The central government has not yet issued all the election regulations, and even the organization in charge of the election has not been clearly instructed. How can we talk about manipulating things?" Just as Director Li was about to continue speaking, Councilor Ding Dinan suddenly slapped the table and shouted: "The students of Zhongzheng University who are petitioning have already crossed the Zhongzheng Bridge and killed people. What are we still listening to the answer to the civil affairs inquiry? We want to discuss emergency measures. Please have the Civil Affairs Department use a written report." Vice Chairman Wang also shouted repeatedly: "Use a written report, use a written report!" Director Li said, "Okay, I will use a written report, but don't say that there are problems that are not answered in person." So he withdrew from the meeting and walked towards the door.</p>
<p>A Magic Trick, Pass the Motion</p>
<p>Suddenly someone shouted, "Close the door!" Some councilors did not know what was happening and immediately left the meeting. The door of the meeting hall was then closed. The chairman ordered the police to stand inside the door and took out a piece of paper with words on it. His hands were shaking non-stop, and he said in a trembling voice: "Now there is an emergency proposal regarding the students of Zhongzheng University marching and petitioning." Everyone listened quietly, but what Vice Chairman Wang read tremblingly was: "Director Li Zhongxiang of the Civil Affairs Department has abused his power since taking office, established factions, attempted to manipulate elections, created local disputes, facilitated private gains, excluded dissidents, and protected corruption. The facts of various illegal and derelict behaviors have been listed by the councilors today and questioned face to face. Such obvious bad deeds are indeed unworthy of his position. A letter should be sent to the provincial government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for strict investigation in order to warn corrupt officials and rectify the political climate. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly!" Proposers: Tao Han, Yang Suochuan, Liu! Dong, Li Zhongding, Xu Xiacheng. Lin Demin, Hu Ding, Zeng Zhaochang, Hua Renqiu, Xiong Zaichi, Yang Yinguang.</p>
<p>At this time, five or six people in the councilor seats suddenly shouted, passing it without objection. The door was opened at this time, and everyone went out one after another. This motion "to warn corrupt officials and rectify the political climate" was passed. The news immediately spread throughout Nanchang City. In order to clarify the facts, reporters visited many provincial councilors. They told me that many councilors were deeply dissatisfied with the proposal and passage of this case in such a magical way and had initiated a signature campaign to request a review. That evening, I visited Director Li Zhongxiang to inquire about his attitude towards the motion passed by the Provincial Council.</p>
<p>Director Li's Humorous Tone Director Li refused to answer any questions about the meeting situation and the motion after he left. He said, "I have nothing to say. The people's eyes are sharp. Everything will be left to the central government and public opinion." When talking about the situation during the inquiry, it aroused his words. He said: I have been a member of the National Political Council for eight years, and I have also attended countless meetings, but I have never encountered today's situation. A series of eighteen obvious inquiries were asked without interruption, and the answering time was so short that I could not even speak. … As for those inquiries, some are very good, but some are extremely abstract. How can I answer them? As for saying that I am trying to manipulate the election, where does this start? I don’t even know how to elect, so how can I talk about "trying to manipulate"? How abstract the words "trying" are!" Finally, he said in a humorous tone, "Think about it, a friend riding in my car is also illegal, my inspection tours to various counties are also illegal, and it is not okay to use someone in their seventies as the council secretary of An'yi County. Moreover, the council secretary is recommended by the county magistrate. Think about it! There is also a gentleman who said that I am "deserted by my followers." I don't understand what "followers" and "relatives" refer to? What is a relative? What is a follower? In my mind, there are only the old folks of Jiangxi. When I returned to the province last year, I was originally determined to serve my hometown and do things for the old folks." Saying this, his attitude and tone seemed very heavy and serious.</p>

<h3>The Situation of Pacification in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— By our correspondent Wang Han'ou, reporting from the 24th</p>
<p>A month ago, the news from Northern Jiangsu was very bad, especially in Shanghai and Nanjing, where rumors spread that even Xinghua and Yancheng had fallen. Not many days later, the rumors dispelled themselves. Except for some harassment by remnants of the communists in the coastal townships, there was no truth to the reports of the fall of Xinghua and Yancheng. Northern Jiangsu is close to Shanghai and Nanjing, and its safety is of particular concern to friends in the Jiangnan region. A special report follows:</p>
<p>The Green Curtain Fades, Communist Guerrilla Activity Diminishes</p>
<p>The situation in Northern Jiangsu is like having scabies, covered in bumps. Remnants of the communists harass the villages, and "underground fighters" create rumors in the cities, moving around and disrupting the people's lives. However, the destructive activities of the communist remnants can only cause irritation like scabies, not a fiery pain. They do not seem to have the strength to fight the Nationalists for cities and land at the moment. Currently, except for the unfortunate occupation of Dazhongji in Dongtai, the communist remnants were utterly defeated by the Nationalist troops in other battles such as Libao and Jugang. Recently, the communists seem to be preserving their strength and have temporarily changed their harassment plans. There have been no "alerts" in various towns for many days. As the wheat harvest begins, the green curtain of crops will soon be completely removed, and the communist army's chance for a "major counter-offensive" on the coast has been lost invisibly!</p>
<p>Weak Self-Defense, People Eagerly Await Reinforcements</p>
<p>The Nationalist forces in Northern Jiangsu are not numerous enough to be stationed in every city and village. The self-defense forces are also weak and dare not defend the villages alone. The work of suppressing the communists is not being done well, allowing them to kill, set fires, create terror in the villages, undermine the morale of the farmers, and hinder the advancement of pacification policies. Recently, many good citizens in the villages, fearing the cruelty of the communist cadres and the possibility of misfortune, have been abandoning their homes and fleeing. Undoubtedly, this year's agricultural productivity in Northern Jiangsu will be significantly lower than in previous years, which is a hidden worry for the future of Northern Jiangsu. The local people's opinion is that unless the government increases its suppression efforts and establishes a solid foundation for the advancement of pacification policies, the people of Northern Jiangsu will not be able to obtain a stable life.</p>
<p>Commander Inspects, Issues Instructions on Pacification Military Affairs</p>
<p>Commander Li, the head of the First Pacification Zone, went to Rugao and Taixing counties the day before yesterday to inspect and make arrangements and issue instructions regarding local pacification military affairs. It is generally expected that as the wheat harvest approaches, the Nationalist troops will mobilize to protect the farmers' wheat harvest and rice planting to stabilize the lives of the people of Northern Jiangsu. The communist remnants will also inevitably try to seize "public grain," and there will be several fierce battles. The reporter interviewed Deputy Division Commander Wang Kejun of the garrison troops, who provided a very detailed account of the pacification situation in Northern Jiangsu. Deputy Division Commander Wang is very talkative and has the demeanor of a Confucian general. He reads "Shen Bao" and local newspapers from various places every day and has a good understanding of news theory. He said, "Recently, we found communist newspapers. Although they are full of distorted propaganda, the writing is popular and vivid, and the descriptions are realistic, making it easy for people to mistake falsehood for truth and be deceived. Although our newspapers report the truth accurately, they may not be as effective at times!" The reporter said, "Our comprehensive news section aims to be vivid and engaging." He said, "I've seen it, the content is very good!"</p>
<p>Land Policy, Being Implemented in Various Counties</p>
<p>Because the communist remnants continue to wreak havoc in the countryside, the land policy to improve the lives of farmers in Northern Jiangsu has not been thoroughly implemented as planned. The governments of Nantong, Taixian, Rugao, and Kunshan have now established land rights clearing committees and mediation committees, formulated methods for managing land registration, and implemented the "3-7 rent reduction." However, because the communist remnants in the rural areas have not been eliminated and the administration cannot be fully implemented locally, most counties are first conducting trials in sections of areas controlled by the government to see the results. In addition, the heavy burden on the people in the townships and frequent local levies are the biggest source of suffering for the people in the pacification zone. Local county governments are currently drafting a plan for unified management of income and expenditure, starting to abolish redundant agencies, and reducing levies. Several counties in Northern Jiangsu have already achieved effective results. The Rugao County Government convened a county government meeting the day before yesterday, and the first issue was to plan for unified management of income and expenditure to reduce the burden on the people.</p>
<h3>Regarding the 800,000 Hong Kong Dollar Fraud Case</h3>
<p>(Statement from the Yongxing Trading Company)</p>
<p>We have recently received a letter from the French Yongxing Trading Company at 95 Huqiu Road in this city stating: "The news about the 'Hong Kong Yongxing Trading Company' on page seven of your newspaper on the 29th was quite detailed. Our company also has a branch in Hong Kong, which could easily cause a misunderstanding among your newspaper's many readers in various locations, leading them to believe that the Yongxing Trading Company that went bankrupt in Hong Kong is our Hong Kong branch. We hereby issue an urgent statement: That Yongxing Trading Company is an organization in Hong Kong that uses our company's Chinese name and is not the 'French Yongxing Trading Company in Hong Kong.'" We are publishing the above statement as is.</p>

<h3>Fire Hydrant in Nanshi Needs Repair</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: There is a fire hydrant at the end of Penglai Road in Nanshi that has been damaged due to years of disrepair, causing water to flow out every day, wetting the streets and causing inconvenience to pedestrians. Moreover, many residents nearby fetch water from it, often leading to quarrels and fights. We hope that the relevant authorities will send someone to repair it as soon as possible. (Sun Zhiting, resident of Penglai Road)</p>
<h3>Pang Bingxun Retires to the Longhai Garden</h3>
<p>— By our reporter Fan Shiqin, reporting from Zhengzhou on the 25th via airmail</p>
<p>Although Pang Bingxun does not yet appear to be senile, his heavy ears and rambling speech indicate some aging. He is like his aging years among the contemporary figures. Using him as a news figure today is like inserting a faded flower into a vase. However, his relationship with northern Henan today still makes him worthy of attention. General Commander Gu Mosan of the Army Headquarters values him quite a bit, and during the recent tension in Xinxiang, he sent someone to bring him to the Longhai Garden in Zhengzhou for rest.</p>
<p>The people of Henan Province, especially the people of northern Henan today, easily think of him not because he has been in Henan for many years, but because his old troops are still surrounded in Anyang, fighting alone; and his second son, Qingzhen, has just led a regiment to Anyang to reinforce them. When talking to him about his old troops defending Anyang, he will talk to you in detail non-stop. He said that Li Zhenqing, the commander of the 40th Division, has been with him since the ninth year of the Republic, how he suppressed bandits in northern Henan in the 22nd and 23rd years, how he defeated the Sakagaki 5th Division in the Linyi area during the Anti-Japanese War, opening the prelude to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War; how he annihilated an enemy brigade in the Zhangyuan campaign, as well as the situations in Zhuxian Town and the Taihang Mountains; and how he covered the safe retreat of Commander Jiang Dingwen in the Luoyang area in the 33rd year. Like an old woman talking about family matters, it is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Commander Li is from Shandong, but he is not tall, but his face is dark and his muscles are tight, which is quite consistent with his nickname "Li Iron Head." His method of leading troops still maintains the style of Feng Yuxiang. A new recruit must first learn three characters on the first day, one hundred characters within three months, be able to write family letters in half a year, and keep a diary in one year. He himself also hired a Hanlin scholar named Du as a teacher in Bo'ai, and there are always several erudite scholars teaching him books. "No sound of gunfire is the sound of reading," is a slogan in his army that is enough to make people proud. In the 30th and 31st years, this army was very prominent and was considered the best army in the country by the inspection team. At that time, even Tang Enbo's army had organized a visiting group, which studied in that army for more than a month. The two sets of tricks played by his soldiers amazed the visiting group. One set was flying over eaves and walking on walls to reach the building; the other set was shooting at distant trenches with a moving target. That army still does not forget Feng Yuxiang's old tune: "Be good citizens at home, be good soldiers in the army;" "Promote old morals, instill new knowledge." So Pang Bingxun always said with a smile: "None of my officials and soldiers have become communists."</p>
<p>Commander Li has been defending Anyang alone, fighting bloody battles with Liu Bocheng's 60,000 troops for more than 20 days, and still stands firm, and has broken Liu Bocheng's boast of taking Anyang within three weeks. It is really not accidental.</p>
<p>After Pang Bingxun talked about his subordinates, he talked about his friend Sun Dianying. Regarding Liu Bocheng's frustration in attacking Tangyin, he feigned a retreat of dozens of miles, but Sun did not take it as a plan, allowing the people in the city to enter and exit, so that the communists mixed into it, destroyed the generator, the electric network failed, and the city fell. He was quite regretful.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou is full of wind and sand, but Longhai Garden relies on lush green trees and is still a quiet corner. Pang reads newspapers and writes books every day, which is also a peaceful place for him. He is no longer a new figure today, and what he talks about is ordinary, not as popular as those who advocate peace today. However, his old troops are guarding a key point in the border area of Jin, Hebei, Lu, and Yu, and he exchanges letters and telegrams with them every day. This makes him still provide a supplement in today's historical materials.</p>

<h3>Renaissance and Social Transformation</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Dr. Gu Yiqiao, recorded by Shen Chengru and Chen Yonglin</p>
<p>I remember when I was in Chongqing, I wrote an article discussing the national revival movements of various countries. According to European precedents, national revival movements include the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Great Political Revolution.</p>
<p>In the case of India, the poet Tagore advocated that to save India, it is necessary to save the soul of India, that is, to make India also have a Renaissance. When the Renaissance of India is completed, India will be able to get rid of the rule of the British Empire. Therefore, he advocated "choosing the standard of culture, not in the new and old, but in the spiritual value contained in this culture." He often taught the students in the International University he founded to sing the poems he wrote in Bengali. He has created more than 2,500 musical scores, which have made great contributions to Indian music. The paintings of the Academy of Art of the International University have formed their own school. On the one hand, it preserves the inherent artistic spirit of India, and on the other hand, it absorbs the strengths of the art of various countries, especially Chinese painting - its murals are especially famous. In addition, Indian dance is also highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Because Tagore's proposition was like this, it was not without differences from Gandhi's opinions. Gandhi believed that if the Indian nation wanted to be revived, regardless of bloodshed or not, it must first be liberated from the British Empire - political reform first - to be successful, otherwise the Renaissance would be meaningless. But Tagore believed that as long as the Renaissance is done first, India can be independent. However, in his later years, after being taught by reality, he agreed with Gandhi's statement, which can be seen in his later works.</p>
<p>But the Indian national revolution is difficult, the biggest obstacle is that there are too many religions in India, in addition to the Hinduism we are familiar with (accounting for 68.5% of the total population) and Islam (21.7%), there are also Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Christianity, etc., about twenty or thirty kinds, and these religions are incompatible with each other, so it is indeed very difficult to unify and independence India. In addition, the class concept of Indian society is very deep, and Gandhi also wanted to break these boundaries. The untouchables in India have no clothes to wear, they only wear a piece of cloth, the untouchables have no shoes to wear, and he also walks barefoot, the untouchables cannot afford hats, and he is bald, which is the performance of his desire to break these boundaries.</p>
<p>Once he fasted for three weeks, and in the second week, his doctor Luo Yi said to the friends who approached him that he was going to die, but on the fifteenth day, his confidence recovered and said: God wants me to live, I still have to work for India. So after he made the prayers of Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and his own poems, he ate again. He is really a saint, and it is not enough to call him Mahatma, he can be said to be the Sakyamuni of modern India.</p>
<p>Therefore, the revival of India first took the road of Renaissance, the political reform has not been completed, and the religious revolution is being done.</p>
<p>Our national revival movement started with Sun Yat-sen's revolution, and it has been about sixty years now, has it been successful? No! The Renaissance is just the opposite of India, lagging behind, starting from the May Fourth Movement, and has not succeeded yet. Of course, we admit that literary and artistic workers have made many contributions, but how many of our works have a place in the international community, what about our paintings, music, and dance? From these aspects, we are not as good as India, India's difficulty lies in the religious revolution, and what we are doing is not a religious revolution, but a social transformation movement.</p>
<p>The Renaissance is not just a matter for those of us who write, and political reform is not just a matter for the government and political parties, these are matters for the majority of people, and should be participated in by the majority of people. Therefore, it is useless to complain about the government for being dissatisfied with the status quo, to complain about foreigners for invading us, and even to complain about individuals. The most important thing is to stand up yourself. If you can stand up yourself, everything can be solved. And to stand up yourself, this society needs to be transformed, otherwise it will be useless no matter how you advocate democratic politics or popularize education.</p>
<p>However, whether it is political reform or social transformation, the most fundamental problem is still economic. If the economic situation improves, there will be other ways. If a writer is bothered every day, how can there be any good works?</p>
<p>Speaking of economy, the economic revival of China depends on the farmers who account for more than 80% of the total population. If the farmers are not exploited, not oppressed, and their living conditions improve, there will be ways for other industries and commerce, otherwise it is unimaginable that 400 million people are starving and the other 50 million can survive.</p>
<p>The road of social transformation in China in the future is either riot or peace. We don't talk about thoughts, doctrines, etc., just ask him how he treats the common people. If we have a way to make more than 80% of the people have enough food and clothing, stand up, then everything else will be solved.</p>
<p>If China can be revived, India will also be revived. If the two nations of China and India, which account for almost half of the world's population, can "rely on their own efforts," then the so-called two major opposing blocs may stop fighting. Britain now promises India autonomy because it is afraid that India will lean towards the Soviet Union. If China is revived, it will not need to beg for help from others. Who would not be willing to be friends with China?</p>
<p>We have fought this eight-year war, and we have to ask the old people whether they can bear it if we still use riots to reform society. Social transformation is a great cause, and it needs everyone to study, suggest, and implement it, and then it can save the nation and the country. (Lecture at the Literary and Art Tea Party on May 18)</p>
<h3>Artists of Huangshan</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Huangshan is the most suitable mountain for painting Chinese landscape paintings among the famous mountains in China, because it has the majestic and great Tiandu and Lianhua, and the strange and beautiful Shixinfeng; and the vastness of the sea of clouds and the weirdness of the West Sea are beyond people's expectations. Huangshan is infinitely variable, so the manuscript taken is also infinitely rich. Ancient and modern calligraphers, who can take a hill, a valley, a peak, and a pine tree, are enough to be famous at that time and passed down to future generations. For example, the masters of the Qing Dynasty, Shi Tao, Mei Qushan, Mei Luye, and Jianjiang, all became famous for writing about Huangshan. There are many modern painters who paint Huangshan, such as Zhang Daqian, Qian Shoutie, and Chen Xiaodie, among others. In recent years, there has been a Huangshan school of painting. I have also traveled to Huangshan twice to paint the mountain spirits; as for the Huangshan people who write Huangshan, there are Huang Binhong, Wang Caibai, and Xu Shiqi. Binhong is over eighty years old and lives in Beijing. The Huangshan he paints is often not very similar; like Xiang Jiu Fangbao's horse, it must be appreciated outside the mares and blacks and yellows. The Huangshan painted by Caibai has smooth brush and ink, and the color is gentle and beautiful, neither close nor far, and both form and spirit are similar. Shiqi loved art since he was a child, and he had already inherited the aura of famous mountains. When he grew up, he studied hard and integrated Chinese and Western painting in one furnace; he traveled extensively in Europe, watched art in Paris, and had already entered the hall and entered the room of Western painting, and exhausted its mysteries. After returning to China, he specialized in national books, and was proficient in flowers, birds, figures, and landscapes. Especially the landscapes he paints are not limited to Huangshan; and the strange pines and strange peaks are nowhere unlike Huangshan. This is probably because what he inherited is thick, and what he has is deep, so he can naturally reveal it, and all of them portray the spirit of Huangshan. After returning from victory, Brother Shiqi founded the Huangshan Art Garden in Shanghai, with elegant toothpicks and jade axes. There are often three or five like-minded people who talk about poetry and painting, and when they are free, they hold pens and dip in ink, and work hard in research day and night. The number of scholars who follow him is also increasing day by day. Huangshan people paint Huangshan, and run the Huangshan Art Garden. The mountain is important to people, and people are named after the mountain. I know that the revival of the Huangshan School is just around the corner. Brother Shiqi recently displayed his masterpieces at the China Science Society on Shaanxi South Road. Many people who love Huangshan in Shanghai will surely be able to feast their eyes.</p>
<h3>Introducing Ms. Xiao Shufang's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Cao Weifeng</p>
<p>I can't paint, I can't express objective opinions about painting, and I don't have any insider's view, but I like to look at paintings. My liking for paintings, like my interest in sculpture and listening to music, is just an amateur hobby. In recent years, whenever there is a painting exhibition, as long as my time permits, I always want to see it; I also never miss the opportunity to visit those museums and art galleries in Europe. Over time, I seem to have some opinions about a painting, a sculpture, or a piece of music, but I know that these are all amateur opinions.</p>
<p>The creative activities of all arts, in the mental activities of the creators and in the process of their creation, are exactly the same. Music is like this, literature is like this, and painting is also like this. The only difference is the difference in tools. In Western painting, like Western literature, in my opinion, they are all progressing according to the three stages of classical, romantic, and realistic. It seems that it is also the case in music; because Westerners have indeed had this kind of evolution in their minds in the past few hundred years.</p>
<p>In the creative life of an art creation, there are also several processes. The learning period is not counted. Afterwards, we can also divide it into three stages: the first is the technical, the second is the creative, and the third is the genius. These three terms are my own inventions. In the technical period, the creator cultivates his expression tools with all his strength. He imitates, he practices, and he works tirelessly. In this period, hand training is more important than everything else, and mental activity is brewing, lying dormant, and cultivating its depth and breadth.</p>
<p>In the second period, the characteristics of personality appear. People engaged in artistic creation must reach this stage to be able to form their own school. As for reaching the third stage, it is something that can be met but not sought. Among the many painters in ancient and modern times, there are not many genius masters who can be the founders of a school and use their creations as the permanent spiritual comfort of mankind.</p>
<p>Due to the conditions of life, environment, cultivation, etc., many practitioners are always stagnant in the first stage, which is really a very regrettable phenomenon. The reason for this, in my estimation, is that although the technique has reached its peak, the spiritual cultivation has not yet reached the corresponding level. Creation requires a deeper understanding than superficial observation, no matter how hard you work or how meticulous you are, it is not enough. As for reaching the third stage from the second stage, it requires life experience and a broader sympathy.</p>
<p>The above statement is my own understanding, and it is inevitable that there will be amateur opinions. But one thing is, it doesn't really matter what the final achievement of the art creator is, the most important thing is whether he is always in progress.</p>
<p>Shufang is a good friend, and criticism of good and bad should be done in person for good friends. As for what can be introduced to the general public, I can say that this is a painter who is always progressing.</p>
<p>When I first met Xinen and Shufang, I only knew that Brother Xinen was the eldest son of Mr. Yu Rizhang and was a doctor; Shufang was the niece of Mr. Xiao Youxiang and was a virtuous housewife, but I didn't know that this couple each had a specialty. Xinen's articles are as delicate as his surgical operations, and Shufang's paintings are just like her, bright and elegant.</p>
<p>When Shufang held a painting exhibition in London, I didn't have time to go, but I only knew that it was highly praised by the people there. This painting exhibition could have been held a few years earlier, but because of the war and because she was sick for several years, she had to postpone it to now. There are old works in it, but there are more new works. In her Chinese paintings, I like her small pieces. In her oil paintings, I hope that people who go to see it will pay special attention to the landscape paintings of Switzerland and Peiping.</p>
<p>(Ms. Xiao's painting exhibition will be held at the Shanghai YMCA at Baxianqiao from June 1st to 7th)</p>
<h3>After Visiting Ms. Zhang Liying's Art Exhibition - On the Future of Chinese Oil Painting</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuxi</p>
<p>Ms. Zhang Liying held a meeting in Shanghai before going to the United States to exhibit her oil paintings and calligraphy to bid farewell to her fellow countrymen. This is of great significance to Chinese art.</p>
<p>It has been at least fifty years since the Chinese began learning Western oil painting. Initially, they merely followed step by step, not only imitating Western methods and subjects but also using Western goods for all materials, including tools, pigments, and canvases. Therefore, the transplanted oil painting ultimately failed to take root and flourish in the fertile soil of China, with no significant achievements for either the artists or the appreciators.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Westerners excessively admired ancient Chinese paintings and even promoted the imitation of recent works of ancient paintings.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the War of Resistance against Japan began, making it impossible to transport oil painting materials. Exhibitions of works imitating ancient Chinese paintings were held, which were more profitable and helped maintain livelihoods. As a result, the roots of oil painting almost withered.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhang Liying is well-versed in European art. The depth of her foundation in painting may not be fully believed by the general public, but those who have a slight understanding can distinguish the level of her skill, which is not as difficult to discern as in Chinese paintings. It is admirable enough that she uses her profound skill to express the unique beauty of China's reality. Moreover, at a time when oil painting is declining, she perseveres and bravely calls out, demonstrating a foresight and courage that ordinary painters cannot match.</p>
<p>Among the exhibited works, the landscape paintings such as "Hong Kong Harbor View" and "Jiaxing Blood Imprint Temple" are able to depict the climate, customs, mythology, philosophy... of China vividly. Moreover, they use folk themes, carefully composing figures and casually embellishing still lifes to fully convey the beauty of Chinese society. Few Chinese painters have done this kind of work and achieved such results. Only a few Westerners have done this kind of sketching in China and exhibited it in Europe and America, but their understanding and selection of themes are never as insightful as those of Chinese painters.</p>
<p>There are many beautiful subjects in Chinese scenery and human affairs. Ms. Zhang Liying will surely supplement them as much as possible before going abroad, making them more perfect.</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese painters mostly depicted the beauty of ancient traditions. Ms. Zhang Liying is the most powerful pioneer in using oil painting to express the beauty of modern China, for which all artists in the world are grateful.</p>
<p>If one artistic trip can revive the trend of Chinese oil painting, it will be of even greater significance to Chinese art.</p>
<h3>The Generation of Art</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The real world is flawed, and people long for an ideal world, idealizing all that is perfect. Thus, "form" and "spirit" are separated. Although our physical bodies cannot transcend reality or make up for flaws, our spirits can be free from the limitations of reality and leap into another transcendent, ideal, and perfect world. This is the origin of imagination, and art is its first product.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 523</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>In less than three minutes, the two had crossed the wasteland and reached the foot of the wall of the nest. Along the way, they not only did not encounter any hidden posts or obstacles, but also the crows cawing on the roof of the nest and the searchlight movements had stopped long ago. There was even no sound of human voices.</p>
<p>Shouyi, seeing this situation, felt a bit uncertain in his heart, but because he was "highly skilled and insightful," he only hesitated for a moment before giving a signal to Hejian, who was five or six yards away. Shouyi stretched out his hands, grabbed the wall, and with a single movement, his whole body was on top of the wall. On the wall, besides some ivy that had been climbing for years and some moss, there were no facilities such as broken glass or electric current. (Originally, this was a long-closed Western-style villa. The owner had left, the location was not good, no one rented it, and it was abandoned here. Unexpectedly, these urban foxes and shrine rats had made it their nest.)</p>
<p>Shouyi lay on the wall, shading his eyes, and carefully observed for a while. He saw that the lights in the small Western-style building, which was ten or so yards away, were off and there was no movement. The weak light from the street lamps dozens of yards away shone on the doors and windows of the nest, outlining the shape of the building, a three-bay, three-story old-fashioned Western-style house. Shouyi was very suspicious, so he signaled Hejian to come up the wall. Hejian was, of course, also agile. Seeing Shouyi's signal, he knew that there was no need to lie in wait at the foot of the wall, so he jumped up and lay on the wall, forming a two-dragons-playing-with-a-pearl pose with Shouyi.</p>
<p>"Old He," Shouyi said softly, "I think the house is empty. We can go down and check it out! We have to be careful of booby traps and the like. Maybe there are still one or two hidden posts lurking."</p>
<p>"You lead the way, brother," Hejian said politely.</p>
<p>The two explored step by step, searching along the way, but found nothing. When they reached the stone steps, they only heard Shouyi say "shi" and then laugh "chi."</p>
<p>"What?" Hejian whispered, still very cautious.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you later... These mischievous guys are really fooling around..." Shouyi said, then quickened his pace and rushed to the open door. He reached out to touch the light switch by the door, but saw that the switch was still on, but there was no light. He knew that those guys had probably cut off the main power line before leaving.</p>
<p>Shouyi told Hejian to wait for a while and that he would be right back. Shouyi groped his way in, and in less than a minute or two, the house suddenly lit up. Shouyi also walked over with a smile:</p>
<p>"The devils only turned off the main power switch, they didn't damage it."</p>
<p>"That's pretty smart... I'm afraid they left it to come back again!" Hejian sneered.</p>
<p>Before the two started to check, fearing that there might be hidden posts, they first went outside, walking along the wall, small bushes, tree roots, etc. When they reached the back gate, Shouyi seemed to have seen something again, said "oh" and laughed "chi" again.</p>
<p>"What?" Hejian asked again.</p>
<p>"Look?" Shouyi pointed to the back door frame and told Hejian to look.</p>
<p>Using the light from inside the house, Hejian looked closely at the spot pointed out by Shouyi. He saw only some crayon-like things, lines of various colors drawn horizontally and vertically;</p>
<p>"Is it some kind of symbol?" Hejian guessed.</p>
<p>"That's right!" Shouyi replied with a smile. There was no time to explain in detail now, but in short, all four mischievous guys had been here...</p>

<p>— Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>You live in the Yellow Mountains, and excel at painting Yellow Mountain pines;</p>
<p>Bold and with many unique forms, conveying a spirit that defies winter.</p>
<p>After a long separation due to war, it's like a reunion after a lifetime;</p>
<p>In your small studio (you have established the Yellow Mountain Art Studio at your residence), ink and brush are still used with elegance.</p>
<p>The disaster in Shandong is not yet over, and a hundred worries fill my heart;</p>
<p>The Six Canons of Painting are like the creation of nature itself, inspiring courage and transforming the stubborn and mediocre.</p>
<p>At the rooster's crow in a night of wind and rain, our path is not fixed;</p>
<p>Strive to follow the footsteps of our predecessors, and revive the Xin'an School.</p>
<h3>Pine Peak Hanging Waterfall</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<h3>A Poem Presented to Mr. Xu Shiqi's Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>I heard that Dao Xuan wielded his brush with divine skill,</p>
<p>Painting a thousand miles of Jialing River in a single day.</p>
<p>Painters have always learned from nature,</p>
<p>And Wang Wei wrote of the Wang River after retiring to the countryside.</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of Fuchun are rich in color,</p>
<p>And Huang Gongwang's true works seem like immortals.</p>
<p>Of all the famous mountains under heaven, the Five Sacred Mountains are majestic,</p>
<p>But none are as beautiful as the ravines and valleys of the Yellow Mountains!</p>
<p>The pine forests rustle, echoing in the empty valleys,</p>
<p>And the sea of clouds is vast after the rain.</p>
<p>My friend Xu Shiqi of Xin'an,</p>
<p>Wields his brush in high spirits, creating clouds and mist.</p>
<p>Not following the ruts and clichés of his predecessors,</p>
<p>He hangs his hometown on the wall.</p>
<p>His talent is naturally different from the masses,</p>
<p>His brush contains the power of a flying waterfall.</p>
<p>Do not ask about the Southern or Northern School,</p>
<p>His divine charm is naturally profound and rooted.</p>
<p>Reading your paintings, I am surprised and amazed,</p>
<p>And ashamed that I am not as good as you, filled with self-pity.</p>
<p>If Wang Wei and Wu Daozi were to come,</p>
<p>They could travel thousands of miles in this small space.</p>

<h3>White Elephant (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>One day, White Elephant didn't come back for lunch. "Could it be that it went to the temple to find someone to hang out with again?" everyone wondered. By nightfall, it still hadn't returned. Xiuying went to the temple that night to look for it, but couldn't find it. The next day, it still didn't come back. The problem became serious, so I wrote two posters: "Lost: One white cat with sun and moon eyes. Any kind person who finds and returns it will be rewarded with 100,000 yuan in legal currency. Funds are reserved and will not be reneged. ×× Road ×× Number Sincerely." Two days later, a neighbor came and said, "A few days ago, I saw a big white cat dead in the pond between the Dizang Nunnery and the Fuxing Bookstore. I'm afraid it's yours." We hastily went to mourn, but couldn't find the body. We asked the police in the Dizang Nunnery, but they said they didn't know and that the sanitation workers probably took it away. We went home, everyone silently mourned, and then discussed the cause of its death. Some said that it accidentally fell into the water, others said that mischievous kids pushed it in. No one could agree. Later, Xinmei reported that a neighbor's child had seen a big white cat dead on the roots of the big willow tree in the pond and that it had been kicked into the pond. Children don't lie, so this theory is probably reliable. Moreover, I've heard that cats don't want to die at home. Knowing that their end is near, they must travel far to a deserted place before passing away. Therefore, this theory seems even more reliable. I think this bit of "cat nature" is quite admirable. It has the spirit of a hero who doesn't want to die in the hands of women and children but prefers to die on the battlefield, wrapped in horse hide. It also has the spirit of a recluse who doesn't want to die in bed but prefers to disappear into the deep mountains, never to be seen again. In short, White Elephant is definitely no longer in the "Dusty World"!</p>
<p>The day after White Elephant disappeared, Mr. Lin came to Hangzhou from Shanghai. As soon as he arrived, he first asked about White Elephant. Upon hearing the news, he was shocked. Because she was originally entrusted by Old Mrs. Duan to bring White Elephant back to Shanghai and return it to its old owner. Only a day apart, what a twist of fate! However, Heaven had its reasons. Fortunately, it had three orphans, which, although not sun and moon eyed, are strong and lively enough to inherit the bloodline. To prevent loss, I specifically entrusted one of the four small calico cats to my friend's house. The other two small calico cats are always by my side. Whenever I put up my feet to read the newspaper or drink wine, they climb on my feet, one high and one low, one moving and one still. Everyone who sees it laughs. I've already become accustomed to it. It seems that the moment I sit down, there are naturally two kittens on my feet. Written on May 27th, the 36th year of the Republic, in Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Authenticity of the Tanaka Memorial</h3>
<p>— Bao Qing</p>
<p>The concrete strategies for Japan's past two-pronged invasion—maritime and continental policies—originated from the Tanaka Memorial. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after verifying the facts against this scheme, found that they matched perfectly. It cannot but regard the Memorial as a concrete manifestation of Japan's true policy towards China. However, Japan has consistently denied the existence of the Memorial. Thus, the issue of the Memorial's authenticity has become a major disputed issue between China and Japan.</p>
<p>When General Qin Decun testified at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, the first thing the defense lawyers refused to let go of was his mention of the Tanaka Memorial in his written statement. Prior to this, Okada Keisuke's testimony on July 2 stated: "Tanaka probably wanted to develop in Manchuria first, and then gradually advance peacefully into mainland China. Also, in 1927, there was a strong desire within the Army Ministry to covet the Asian continent. At that time, Prime Minister Tanaka had a final plan for the continent, and he sent a representative to the Northeast to seek the construction rights for important railways. I have never seen the Tanaka Memorial, so I believe that this document does not exist." Okada was the Minister of the Navy in 1927 and must have participated in the national policy of encroaching on the continent. His testimony also revealed Tanaka's intention to invade China.</p>
<p>When Qin testified, the defense lawyers immediately questioned him by quoting Okada's words, and their questioning was entirely based on the denial of the existence of the Tanaka Memorial. Qin then stated: The Chinese people would never forge the Memorial. Moreover, whether the Memorial exists or not is not the main point, but the fact proves that the steps of Japan's plan to conquer the world were first to invade "Manchuria and Mongolia," then North China, and then most of China. After that, there was the attack on Pearl Harbor and the occupation of the Philippines. I cannot prove its authenticity or disbelieve it. Everything predicted in it is as if Tanaka were a prophet. It matches the subsequent actions of the Japanese army in China step by step.</p>
<p>During this period, Mr. Luo Jialun, the current ambassador to India, wrote an article providing the facts he personally experienced. One is: He once visited Tang Erhe (later a Chinese traitor), a pro-Japanese figure who participated in the Northeast's confidential affairs during Zhang Zuolin's time. According to him, "This document was obtained from his hands with a lot of effort. This was a very difficult task. I know the details and have seen the original Japanese text. Who has such great talent and such familiarity with the inside information to be able to forge it! If there were such talented people in the Northeast who could create such a document, there would be no September 18th Incident." The second is: After a certain meeting in Beijing in the 24th year of the Republic, he talked with a certain important person who was responsible in the Northeast, saying that if the original document was not searched by the Japanese when he returned to the Northeast in the future, he could show it to him. Luo also speculated that these originals were copies and photos. The Japanese knew the seriousness of the document's leakage, so they immediately denied it and may have destroyed the original. After the war, in order to reduce the responsibility for war crimes, there was even more need to eliminate it. Unfortunately, Luo did not inquire with Tang Erhe to clarify the details, nor did he point out the name of the person and continue to pursue the matter.</p>
<p>Later, on October 8, the Soviet prosecutor presented at the Tokyo International Tribunal the confession of the Russian traitor Semenov, who had already been executed in the Soviet Union, confirming that Japan's plan to conquer the world, the "Tanaka Memorial," did exist. Semenov claimed that Tanaka Giichi had personally told him about this matter.</p>
<p>In short, this mystery has not yet been fully revealed. The Japanese deny it; Europeans and Americans focus on empirical evidence and naturally doubt the document's existence. But we firmly believe that this is a document that cannot be overthrown in fact. We still hope that the Chinese people can work hard to explore the inside story of this mystery and fully reveal it to the world in order to prove Japan's consistent policy of aggression against China since the Meiji Restoration.</p>
<h3>A String of Pearls</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>White Terror</p>
<p>Food is incredibly expensive, the price of each grain compared to pearls! Peasants' sweat and blood, famine victims' tears! Few rich, many poor, life is hard to sigh!</p>
<p>Wailing sounds fill the fields, relief is difficult, starving corpses fill the cities, hard to clear, Guanyin clay swallowed in injustice! Wild dogs fight over corpses, a world of utter misery?</p>
<h3>Drops of Gold</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Taiwanese Watermelons on the Market</p>
<p>Taiwan produces beautiful watermelons, rare treasures, good business! The price exceeds riding a crane to Yangzhou, exhausting the immortal's breath!</p>
<p>Before summer arrives, it dominates the market, the poor's eyes, the rich's mouths - smiling, sweet juice drips gold, every drop of farmer's tears!</p>
<p>Note: The price of watermelon is 6,000 yuan per catty, each weighing fifteen or sixteen catties, costing nearly 100,000 yuan. Recently, prices have soared, probably more than this number. The ancients regarded "having 100,000 strings of cash and riding a crane to Yangzhou" as a source of pride. If they heard the price of watermelons, they would definitely shake their heads incessantly.</p>
<h3>How to Listen to a Piano Recital?</h3>
<p>— Sheng He</p>
<p>A piano solo (Piano) is a common program in ordinary concerts, and individual recitals by pianists are also often seen. In modern times, piano solo recitals are called Piano Recitals, referring to playing entirely from memory without looking at the score. This name and method originated with the piano master Liszt.</p>
<p>When listening to a piano solo, one cannot only consider whether the music is pleasing to the ear, because this is the most superficial way of listening, which is "understanding the sound but not appreciating the music." An advanced music listener should have at least the following common knowledge for appreciating a piano solo:</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention to whether the sound of the playing is clear, especially during fast passages and staccato and arpeggio playing. An excellent piano player must make every note very clear, without being blurred or chaotic.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to whether the technique is flexible and beautiful. Technique is an important factor in playing the piano. It is not only related to playing skills but also contributes to the expression of the music. Because pianos are habitually placed on the left side of the stage, when going to listen to a piano solo, you should choose a seat on the left side in advance so that you can see the soloist's technique.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to the soloist's understanding of the music, in other words, attention to the expressive aspects. An excellent pianist, when playing, can control the audience's vision and hearing from beginning to end, attracting them so that they lose their autonomy. In slow passages, the playing is gentle and winding; in fast passages, it is lively and powerful; in relaxed passages, it is calm and composed; in tense passages, it is as heavy as thunder.</p>
<p>(4) Pay attention to the end of the music. Generally, a piece chosen for a solo is a famous piano piece with relatively difficult and complex techniques and content. The end of the piece often has special developments. Either the expressive power is richer, or there is a special ending, indicating the complete end of the music. Therefore, listeners should not relax their attention when the playing is about to end.</p>
<p>In addition, if you want to further appreciate the beauty of harmony and the soloist's skillful development and evolution of the music, you must understand the content of the music in advance and have considerable cultivation.</p>
<h3>It's Miuzhuan - Not Miuzhuan</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>In the Free Talk section on the 29th, Mr. Qi Chong's article "Talking about Seal Script Characters" read "缪篆" (miù zhuàn) as "謬篆" (miù zhuàn). The preface to Shuowen Jiezi says:</p>
<p>"Since then, the Taishu had eight styles: first, Dazhuan (Greater Seal Script); second, Xiaozhuan (Lesser Seal Script); third, Kefu (Engraved Tallies); fourth, Chongshu (Insect Script); fifth, Niaoshu (Bird Script); sixth, Muzhuān (Mu Seal); seventh, Shushu (Shu Script); and eighth, Lishu (Clerical Script)."</p>
<p>"Since Wang Mang usurped the throne, he ordered the Da Sikong Zhen Feng and others to proofread the documents and books, thinking that they should be produced and that he should revise the ancient script. At that time, there were six styles: first, Guwen (Ancient Script), the script in Confucius's wall; second, Qizi (Variant Characters), that is, ancient script with variations; third, Zhuanshu (Seal Script), that is, Xiaozhuan, created by Cheng Miao, a commoner ordered by Qin Shi Huang; fourth, Zuoshu (Left Script), that is, Qin Lishu (Qin Clerical Script); fifth, Miuzhuan (Mu Seal), used for tomb seals; sixth, Chongyan (Insect Words), used for writing on banners."</p>
<p>"Mu Seal was originally a character used for tomb seals. Why is it called '缪篆' (Miuzhuan)?" Duan Yucai's commentary on Shuowen Jiezi says:</p>
<p>"缪, read as the '缪' (móu) in '绸缪' (chóu móu, meticulous)."</p>
<p>It can be seen that it is not the "謬" (miù, error) in "謬讚" (miù zàn, false praise).</p>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"Spy's Loyal Soul"</h3>
<p>— Wu Bian</p>
<p>Following "The Pink Bomb," this is another film depicting "underground workers." The story tells how Chongqing sent intelligence personnel to Guangzhou to work. Thus, a firefight with Japanese special agents unfolded, collecting intelligence, destroying radio stations, and arranging a series of thrilling events.</p>
<p>Here, women are unimpeded. The female intelligence agent played by Yuan Meiyun can do whatever she wants. The head of the Japanese intelligence agency, Kong Qi, and the chief of special agents, Yamamoto, are simply being played by her in the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing is that many of the characters in the play are hollow. What can this kind of idiot dream script give us?</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Xu Liang, and Gu Wenzong are all doing their best in "acting." There is no question of good or bad acting skills. The only one who is relatively satisfactory is Yuan Lingyun's Gao Feng Chuanzi.</p>
<p>From the handling of each scene, the use of montage, and the editing of the play, one can see the director's incompetence and lack of common sense. In short, this is a film that wastes film and wastes the audience's time.</p>
<p>New Knowledge</p>
<h3>Sixth Sense</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Have you ever had the feeling - before picking up the phone to answer a sudden call, that you can roughly guess who the caller is? Have you ever had the experience - when a person has not said a word, that you can guess the meaning of the word? If so, this is what psychologists call Extrasensory Perception (ESP) - the sixth sense. In other words, it is an instinct to feel things without going through the five senses of sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell.</p>
<p>Professor Rhine and his assistants at Duke University spent seventeen years of research to prove the existence of the sixth sense. The most common method of testing is "clairvoyance", that is, guessing the content of a painting without going through sight or touch. Regarding these, the famous American Happiness magazine has selected a lot of materials. The conclusion reached is that all mentally normal people should have the possibility of a sixth sense; those with close relationships, such as twins or couples, are even more obvious. Twins often consider the same very strange event at the same time. To give another example: Someone has a sudden, inexplicable feeling before going on a trip, as if some danger is about to strike him, so he cancels the trip. As a result, the means of transportation he planned to take did crash.</p>
<p>Psychologists tell us that the sixth sense is extremely difficult to control; otherwise, this mysterious and inexplicable sixth sense will no longer be unfathomable. (This article is taken from the May issue of Happiness Magazine)</p>

<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Just then, Zhang Chang suddenly rushed over again in a frenzy.</p>
<p>"Old Zhu, Mrs. Hu's fever is getting higher! It's very dangerous! Very dangerous!" He rushed to Old Zhu, covered in sweat, and said in a very hurried tone, "More red spots have appeared on her arms. I'm afraid it's typhus. You have to think of a way quickly!"</p>
<p>"Alas! Terrible, terrible!" Lu the cripple couldn't help but sigh again.</p>
<p>Everything that happened today seemed to be deliberately tormenting Old Zhu. He couldn't help but start to feel anxious.</p>
<p>"Think of a way? Brother, you tell me! What way is there to think of in this place?" He stared at Zhang Chang's face with widened eyes, as if he was angry with him.</p>
<p>"Now, the first thing is to save Mrs. Hu. Either find a doctor for her quickly, or make her leave here quickly to a place where there is a doctor!" Zhang Chang said breathlessly. Although he was also concerned about Lan, it was different from Zhu Zhaonian's feelings for Lan. Therefore, his thoughts were not chaotic, and he spoke very logically.</p>
<p>"Car? Doctor? As long as there are any, I, old man, am willing to exchange my life for them, ......" His nerves were obviously somewhat abnormal. His speech was unknowingly as激烈的(激烈的?) as a proclamation, and his voice became high-pitched and sharp, making it unpleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>"I do have a doctor." Zhang Chang gradually understood his emotions, so he tried his best to calm his mind and changed to a conciliatory tone, saying, "If you go up one more stop, it's Hechi. Hechi is a county and has a county hospital. My uncle is the director there ......"</p>
<p>These words were like drinking a large bowl of cold water for Old Zhu, and his heart calmed down slightly.</p>
<p>"Very good, this is very good!" He showed a decisive expression and said, "Then, I'll go talk to them about the car right away. No matter what, let's get Lan to (哪里?) first!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he immediately left Lu and Zhang Chang and squeezed into the crowd.</p>
<p>This took about twenty-five minutes. The result was that he only achieved half of his goal. One driver agreed to take two people to Hechi or (哪里?). This was because Zhu Zhaonian first revealed the name of the head of the Transportation Department of the Trade Committee, and this driver happened to have advanced through Zhao's connections.</p>
