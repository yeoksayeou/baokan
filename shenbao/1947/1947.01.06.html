<h3>整軍工作大部完成　行轅綏署縮小範圍　東北行轅已實行新編制</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕政府遵照政協決議，實施整軍後，集團縮軍，軍縮爲師，師縮爲旅，已大部完成，辦理平時國防之師團管區，亦分別先後設置，軍隊國家化之條件，大致具備。按照整軍方案，主席各行轅及綏靖公署，應即撤銷，惟以各綏靖區撫輯流亡，千頭萬緒，而各行轅。綏署，素爲軍政兼施機構，若一旦裁撤，勢將影響綏靖區之設施，故當局決暫予保留，惟範轉酌于縮小。據聞原各行轅·綏署總務·軍法兩處保留原名，政務處改稱民事處，政治部改稱新聞處，各視察室取消，其業務併入有關處辦理，裁减之人員的爲三分之一，最近當可實施。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽五日電〕東北行轅奉令改級後，五日起實行新編制，前秘書廳及軍務。人事·參謀·交通·航警五處撤銷，經理處因業務關係，暫綏結束。總務，軍法二處照舊，新設主在辦公室及（一）（二）（三）（四）四處。此次改組除人事上有所更動外，編制及經費均形縮减，編餘人員達二百餘名，佔過云工作人員總數二分之一强。</p>
<h3>青年黨參加政府　原則上業已確定　董必武招待記者說明共黨立塲</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨參加政府問題，將於日內召開之中常會會議中討論決定，該黨總部已因各地代表匯集而倍增熱鬧。該黨中常委余家菊氏，昨對記者稱：本黨參加政府，在原則上業已確定，因結束訓政，實施憲政，各黨各派均有出力之義務，惟就技術上言，在何種情况下參加政府，則尙待研究。明言之，本黨之願望在參加政府後，務須對國家確有好處，對推進憲政能有積極有益的作用、余氏又稱二參加政府問題，政府代表僅在與本黨同人私人談話間提及，迄今尙未作正式之商談。渠對大局前途，認爲不能輕易樂觀，但總有路可尋，眞正之和平，必能實現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕連日因民社·靑年兩黨在滬集會，政府方面赴滬接洽者多未言旋，故政治重心顯已移滬。張治中來京後，分途拜客，今日曾訪晤吳譽曰等，晚赴司徒大使晚宴，有皮宗敢等作陪。又靑年黨劉東明等，今晚車赴滬，與該黨留滬人士有所商談。</p>
<p>〔本賴南京五日電〕共產黨代表董必武，五日下午四時舉行記者招待會，報吿黃河堵口問題，發表書面談話，（全文見第二段）並答覆記者詢問如次：</p>
<p>問：和談新基礎如何？</p>
<p>答：共產黨仍以解散國大及軍事上恢復一月十三日之態勢爲基礎。共產黨提出此兩項意見後，迄今尙未接確政府答覆。</p>
<p>問：邵力子來訪，是否與和談有關？</p>
<p>答：無關，純爲拜年性質。本人於三日亦曾回拜，惟未晤。</p>
<p>問：張治中將軍抵京，是否預備往訪？</p>
<p>答：擬往致謝意，因盛世才時代，曾扣留共方百餘人，由張交換釋出，情殊可感。</p>
<p>問：國大已閉薦，和談尙未重開，對新局勢有何看法？</p>
<p>答：和談無希望。</p>
<p>間：共產黨所堅持兩條件中，對國大一項，目前國大實已開過，共產黨對此如何看法？</p>
<p>答：可作爲歷史上之事件。</p>
<p>問：承認新憲法否？</p>
<p>答：不承認。</p>
<p>問：新憲法與政協憲草之基本精神相差幾許？</p>
<p>答：根本不符。</p>
<p>問：如訪張治中將軍時，張提出和談問題，共產黨將作何表示？</p>
<p>答：當視情形而定。</p>
<p>問：對白崇禧事件意見如何？</p>
<p>答：完全是造謠的事情。旋於五時散會。</p>
<h3>張羣訪張君勵　商討改組政府</h3>

<h3>政府改組以前　應先恢復和談</h3>
<p>民盟軍伯鈞發表主張</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟章伯鈞氏昨對記者稱：「民盟認為應先恢復和談，然後改組政府，如政府仍照國大方式進行改組，各黨各派並未全體參加，情形不會圓滿。此項意見業已正式吿知雷震張羣爾先生。全國停戰和平實現後，民盟一定參加政府，而在和平實現之前，客觀上如有需要，民盟亦決不放棄爲國共調解斡旋之責任。」章氏繼稱：「民盟爲擴大組織，協調盟員間意見，二中全會預備會中曾決定全體盟員一律以個人資格入盟，不再以團體名義參加，如此則其他組織之份子，亦可加入，爲民盟之盟員，惟此項辦法，對中共黨負並不適用，因中共黨性特強，其黨員無自由決定意見之可能。」</p>
<p>〔又訊〕民盟二中全會，定今晨九時正式開幕，出席中委及各地總支部代表共三十六人。昨晚該盟中常委舉行談話會，決定開會地點嚴守秘密，開幕典禮推張瀾主席，選舉主席團後，由該盟中央各處部提出報吿，明日由各地總支部提出報吿，以後逐日審查提案，討論間題，會期五日，閉會時將發表宣言，表明民盟對當前時局之態度。</p>
<h3>第三黨改名</h3>

<h3>憲政促進會　月內可成立</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕黨政實施促進委會籌備人選，六日國防委會開會時，將提出決定。幷聞一俟籌備人選發表，即將積極進行組織，本月內當可成立。</p>

<h3>憲法中英文本　最近即可發行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕國大制定之中華民國憲法，業經中央社郝志翔君譯成英文，並曾就敎於專家學者加以修正，已由上海大陸報及自由論壇刋登，現擬印行中英對照單行本，一俟整理就緒，即可發行。</p>
<h3>鄭洞國將兼任　吉林省府主席</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽五日電〕吉主席梁華盛免職，因有多方向中央控訴，故聞梁將受議處，繼任人選傳將由鄭洞國兼任。</p>
<h3>「國大實錄」將開始編纂</h3>
<p>預定兩月內究成工作</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國民大會將成立國大實錄編纂委員會，詳盡搜集有關紀錄·文獻·報導·及評論，系統彙編爲「國大實錄」，藉供參考，並將此空前事業之成功經過，埀諸久遠。此事業經大會主席團議決，並已請准政府追加預算。該會之組織人選將由大會秘書處決定，預計於兩月內完成全部工作。</p>
<h3>參政會駐會委員會　繼續舉行審查會　李儻凌鴻勳等列席答詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕參政會駐委會，五日上午九時舉行第四次臨時會，續審議國家總預算，出席邵力子，錢公來，傅斯年等，財次李儻，交次凌鴻勳，交部會計處長江萬平，資委會委員孫拯，會計處長張峻文，技正紀樹農等列席，首由范予遂報吿審查小組第二組關於交通，濃林，資委會等尙朱結束有疑問外，請即答覆，凌鴻勳稱：國營事業中全國鐵路除京滬路能勉强維持外，除均貼補，而航空公司，招商局復列入預算，似不妥當。左舜生稱；此項預算極不完整，公路總局收入預計一千萬，支出則爲二十五億，不合理。李儻稱：此乃普通預算，而非營業預算，但編造方面亦有不合處。尹述賢稱：問題不在編造合不合，而是配合不配合，所有機關僅有支出多少，面無收入多少，無法知其收支情形，而審查時欲以收入彌補預算差額，則無從着手。江萬平稱：自應配合編造，但營業預算在技術上尙多困難，未能造好。彭革陳詢究竟有多少未列入預算，其不列入之原因何在？范予遂詢以營業收入預算不列入，則成爲私人營業，與國家營業無利益。甘家磬稱：儲匯局未列入，是否算國家總預算中一部門？江萬平乃說明儲匯局營業預算未拿來之故。范予遂旋提出預算中農民銀行僅五億收入，實業銀行，通商銀行亦僅二百萬，實數決不止此，戴銘禮答：農行利息甚少，故收入少，實業，通商爲官商合辦，營利至年終始知。關於華孚烟廠何以死入則部預算，係因數年前曾在渝由財部招商股五千股，爲官商合辦之工廠，迄今官股尙未退淸，故仍須列人財部澦算。復有人詢問四行配售黃金價格，財部是否有糊過問，何以金融市場如此混亂，如有權過問，則此權操之何人？戴銘禮答：黃金買賣之收入交國庫，管理則由　聯總處及央行，該項數字及收支情形，當由專人列席報吿。旋提各資委會之預算項“過於簡單，收人爲三百億支出爲二千餘億，實不符，張峻文稱：三百億爲羣業收入，亦即業務之本錢，當有人提出不賺錢不如關鬥，張稱；國營事業不是專為　錢，旋錢公來等表示，資委會不能停辦，當即散會。午後第二審查會繼續開會，並定六日上午九時舉行全體會，全部審查工作，即可吿竣。</p>

<h3>張平羣在美演說　我局勢顯有進步　對美國友人提三點希望</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約四日電〕我駐紐約總領事張平羣，今在波士頓外交政策協會　會席上，向該會五百名會員發表演辭，題為「中國和平之展望，」張氏稱：中國人民甚盼美國友人能繼續其經濟合作，哈佛大學教授費正淸及林邁可，亦以個人資格，發表意見。張氏今日對美國友人提出三點希望：（一）美國友人必須瞭解中國局勢及中國問題之真相，蓋言論與目的間時有差別，且宣傳又為共黨特長，故此種真　瞭解，今日尤為必要。（二）吾人希望美國在中國之經濟復興方面，予以合作，至少當在與軍事無關之事業上予以合作，蓋此種事業顯在恢復中國工業發展，及改良普通人民之生活者。（三）希望美國友人，能運用才智，辨別懷有偏見者所發表之各種聲明。張氏稱：中國之共黨問題，已較以前大為澄淸，渠深信和平之希望，亦較以前光明，蓋中國真實局勢，已較前進步，中國政府仍準備以政治方式，解決共黨問題，俾求中國之統一，苟政治解決不能成功，則吾人將用其他方式求取統一。張氏復論及我國政府之戰前　設成績稱：若干美國記者，未能使美國人民獲悉中國政府之努力建設，此誠為一不幸之事。張氏舉例稱：戰前數年中央政府曾施行政策，教農民使用較進步之農業設備，改進土地之利用。</p>
<h3>遠東國際軍事法庭　審判日戰犯情形　梅汝璈抵京對記者談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕遠東國際軍事法庭推事梅汝璈博士，日前由日本返國抵滬，於四日晚由滬來京，由於東京審判工作，日趨緊張，即將進入被告辯護階段，故氏將於下週離京轉滬赴日。梅氏此行，係乘法庭新年休假之便返國，向我政府當局報告遠東國際法庭組織經過及近況，並搜集裁判所需之資料。</p>
<p>記者頃訪梅氏於立法院，暢談遠東國際軍事法庭審判情形，及其個人對此次日戰犯審判之看法。該軍事法庭完全為國際性者，由十一個國家派代表所組成，因為專審判日本之首級戰爭罪犯，故在國際軍事法庭上加上遠東兩字，以別於紐倫堡之國際法庭。</p>
<p>將入辯護階段</p>
<p>東京國際法庭於去年六月三日正式開審以來，迄今已達七閱月，檢察處提供之證據，審判之起訴階段，已告一段落，不久即將開始被告辯護階段，預料需時四個月，至最後為評論證據宣判及執行。此一階段較簡單，約一二月即定，因此國際法庭之工作，預料於本年五六月間可能全部完畢。梅氏稱：該法庭所審判之首級日本戰犯，原共有廿八人，但自松崗洋佑病死後，大川因為患神經病，於第一次出庭毆打東條以後，即一直未受審訊。大川之神經病，聞已逐漸轉好，將來定將繼續受審及被宣判。因此，在起訴極端，經常只有廿六人出席受審，其中有六人曾任首相，餘均為閣員大臣，因牽涉極廣，搜集證件又頗費轉折，故工作至為繁忙，檢審處所提供之人據文件，已達二千餘件，記錄達一萬六千多頁，傳訊證人亦一百名左右，將來開始辯論庭時，工作將更為緊張。在起訴階段，各被告只出席聽審，並未說話，此時渠等將提出最有利之證明，加以充分之辯解，每個被告，均請有美日籍律師，若果各被告不自請律師時，麥克阿瑟元帥亦必成為指定辯護律師。目前被告之五十四位律師，均極為著名，在日本方面多為日本帝國大學法律名教授或法律學會會長，均係日本國內第一流之律師，預料屆時必有一番激烈之辯論。</p>
<p>審理遲緩原因</p>
<p>梅氏對該法庭審理工作進行遲緩一點，加以詳細解釋，據稱：主要原因如（一）案情太複雜，牽涉過廣，時間方面，雖規定自「九一八」日本侵華起以至於此次大戰投降為止，但「九一八」之遠因皇姑屯張作霖被炸死事件之歷史事實，亦被搜求追索，加以分析申述：空間方面，可以說由松花江起，以迄於南洋羣島，其中所牽連之國家不少，故所提各項證據，數目龐大而繁多，處理實至費時需時。（二）語言關係，除用英語以外，因依法要同時應用被告之語言因此通常均用英日兩種語言，轉輾傳譯校對等，最為費時，甚至若干外國證人，更需數度翻譯，如　儀出庭作證八天，實際只說兩天話，其餘時間，均費在翻譯上；秦德純次長出席作證情形，亦復如是，到庭五天，而實際只需說一天之話，（三）英美訴訟程序週密，最注重具體而充分之證據，此由十一國家充分提供，故達二千件之多，其紀錄一萬六千多頁，亦遠過於紐倫堡國際法庭。（四）制度關係，採取反對質詢，又名「橫質詢」，此為中國與大陸各國所無，此項制度，各被告律師可質詢證人，詢問於被告最有利之話。各被告律師可據理反駁，證言盡舉事實，加以攻擊，並亦可對證人之信用人格，提出質詢，加以攻擊，以削減證人之身份資格及其力量，間接增加被告有利地位，例如詢問證人是否犯過罪，有無神經病，曾否患過花柳病等，五十四位被告律師，盡量攻擊各證人之弱點，亦為進行遲緩之原因。（五）十一個起訴國家間若干地方，在法理上之觀點，未能統一，不免發生衝突或重複，使工作進行更見遲緩。</p>
<p>提出兩點觀念</p>
<p>最後，梅氏對東京國際法庭工作，提出觀念兩點：第一，杜魯門總統曾宣稱：紐倫堡審判戰犯為第二次世界最大之一件事，美國人並將紐倫堡審判戰犯工作，列為一九四六年大事件之一，但東京法庭，亦居於同樣重要地位，耗費大量人力物力與智慧，使用各種新科學設備，如印刷翻譯照相等，其主要目的，絕不在於二十六名日本戰犯之生死問題而已，而在建立或鞏固國際法之原則，將已有不明顯之國際法原則，更加明確，進而發揚光大之，此主要原則，即為「侵略戰爭是罪犯。」第二，凡參加戰爭之個人，亦為犯罪，不管計劃執行，或陰謀，或宣揚民族優越文化，鼓動侵略戰爭等，除國家應負法律上責任外，個人亦應有罪。經第二次大戰紐倫堡及東京兩次之審判後，凡個人之行動，其影響於國際和平秩序，亦須受法律之制裁，吾人於此，　獲得一肯定之結論矣。</p>

<h3>平津區敵偽產業　總值逾二萬億元　孫越崎談處理經過情形</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕平津區敵偽產業處理局局長孫越崎，最近因公由平晋京，順道來滬，昨在滬寓接見中央社記者略述該局一年來處理敵偽產業經過情形如次：該局自前年十二月開始，在平成立，旋陸續在天津，唐山，石家莊，張家口，太原成立辦事處，以上所在各地，整個敵偽產業，雖尚未屆總結算期，然照目前估計，其總值至少能超過二萬億元以上，多數為不動產，如工廠，礦廠，及房產等，經處理折值解送國庫者，約計兩千四百餘億元，內大部份為金銀，約值九百億元，其餘則為房屋，工廠及日用品等，內中又以日用品佔收入之最大多數，工廠部份，為數一百餘所，物資折價，運用託書，標售，拍賣種種方式，工廠房屋，均採用標售方法，如兩次尚未獲標出者，則改用洽購法解決。此外，如處理工廠，及房產糾紛，經發還各原有業主，已辦理完竣者，共達三千餘件，此項工作，已可告一段落，再如生產事業，如天津華新等七紗廠，已撥交中國紡建公司，共擁有三十萬紗錠。又有每日產煤一萬二千噸之開　，每日產煤二千噸之井陘，亦撥交資委會，河北省政府合作管理，至北平天津，唐山三地用高壓綫連成發電一萬三千餘　之冀北電廠，已次第修復，即將全部開工，每日能產鋼鐵八千餘噸之華北鋼鐵廠，亦已撥交資委會。孫氏對該局各地總結束時期之估計，約在今年六月間，至延期原因，則係各地辦事處之處理手續，比較困難云。</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕平津敵產處理未竣，處理局目前不結束，據該局負責人談：該局業務範圍，除北平外，並包括太原及張家口等，津處範圍較上海為廣，處理事務亦較上海為繁，因上海局成立較北平為早，處理方面亦較簡便，一年期間，大半處理完竣，平津區局一年來處理者只達四分之三，除漢奸產業因與司法程序關連，尚未處理一件，其餘有關敵偽物資均已分期標售，已至第八期，揆度平津這情形，目前恐不克結束，以處理期限計之，尚須半年時日，始將零星物資及小型工廠標買完竣。孫越崎局長亦因平津區局是否延長日期問題，赴京請示。</p>
<h3>黃河堵口復堤問題　董必武發表談話　請政府速撥經費</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕共產黨代表董必武，五日下午四時舉行記者招待會，對黃河堵口問題，發表書面談話，其要點如次：「黃河之堵口復堤，必須配合進行，下游復堤工程與河邊居民遷移救濟兩大繁重工作，非數月不能完成；唯自七月間上海協議後，政府當局（一）延不撥給經費，『解放區』已墊出之初步復堤工款四十九億，第二期工程費用亦未付分文；（二）上海協議允於去年八月至十二月撥淸河床居民救濟費一百五十億，拖延未付；（三）破壞工程，進攻『解放區』。最後據報告，花園口於去年十二月廿七日開始實行放水，淹沒下游居民，『解放區』救濟委員會主席黃必武特向聯總，行總，水利委會提出嚴重抗議，並提出五項意見：（一）立刻停止堵口放水工作，追究放水責任；（二）花園口堵口須遲至五個月以後，否則其後果由政府負責；（三）河床居民救濟費一百五十億，必須迅速付淸；（四）復堤工款，應按堤綫長短，工程大小，公平合理分配；（五）聯總協助我方治黃之物資器材，應直接交付『解放區』。」此函已分別發出，惟尚無覆信。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕中央派駐行總代表伍雲甫，昨日下午二時，在思南路周恩來寓邸，舉行記者招待會，報告黃河堵口工程近況，伍氏並發表中共代表董必武致行總函一件，內容約分為：（一）黃河堵口工作，中共方面未作準備，且黃河恢復舊道問題，以該地區居民眾多，如欲辦理遷移，經費浩大，故黃河恢復舊道之工程，異常困難；（二）政府前為治黃工程，曾允撥款一千五百億元，但迄今分文未撥，故希望政府迅將此款撥放，以利進行云。</p>

<h3>民主憲政年的市政</h3>
<p>上海市參議會第二次大會將於今日揭幕，此一民意機關大會之召開，適值中華民國憲法公布，所謂民主憲政年的開端，是其意義深長，自不待言。上海市參議會的產生，雖在憲法公布以前；然市參議員之選舉與夫市參議會的成立及其過去的成績，已充分表現民主憲政的精神。此次第二次大會的召開，正當制憲大業完成之後，仰體制憲及憲法的精神，必能為民主憲政樹一典範。憲政的常軌是人民有權，政府有能。市參議會雖為地方自治的一種制度，然與國家憲政的盛衰息息相關。國家政治的是否健全，築基於地方政治的是否健全。英國沒有成文的憲法，卻為近代憲政的模範，此中因素雖不單純，但地方政治的健全實為一個主要的關鍵。近代英國的憲政發展，實築基於地方政治的健全。此與歐洲大陸，特別是法國的發展，正呈着極有趣的對照。如今上海市參議會第二次大會的召開，正當我們民主憲政年的開端，願由於此次市參議會大會的召開，能使上海的市政，更趨於健全。</p>
<p>欲使市政趨於健全，必使代表市民意志的參議會要能發揮它的效能；此在市參議會本身必須善用其職權，而在市政機關尤須如何恪遵參議會決議的精神善為執行。在民主政治下，人民是主人，政府必須本人民的意向而施政。市參議會由市民所選舉出來的代表組成，實為一市的最高權力機關；所有市政的設施，悉應聽命於參議會的決定。市政機關如不直屬於參議會，也僅為執行決策的機關。從前上海公共租界的所謂「工部局」，就是由納稅人選舉出來的代表機關，所有「公共租界」的市政都由此項代表機關決定，交由直屬各部門執行。如今我們有上海市政府的組織，又有民意機關的市參議會，是上海市政府，除執行中央交辦案件外，對於一切市政設施，均應聽命於市參議會。茲值民主憲政年的開端，而上海又為全國第一都市，今後對於上海市政的推進，市參議會應積極發揮它的效能。如果有人說：「市政府是大老爺，參議會是老爺，」這是不民主的。倘使我們可沿用舊稱謂來表示我們的意思，則市參議會應該是「大老爺，」市政府只是「老爺」們的差役而已。</p>
<p>講到上海的市政，直是千端萬緒，百廢待興。如今上海市道路的崎嶇不平，也就是上海市政百孔千瘡的一個寫照。當前上海市參議會的惟一要務，便在如何興復市政。為要復興市政。便不得不有大宗支出。此次市參議會的召開，其主要的任務，因此，便在審議市政府所提出的預算，其數字之龐大，在上海市政的發展史上，實為空前；即就與首都南京市的預算相比較，亦屬驚人。政府財政不適用私人財政量入為出的原則，這是眾所周知的事；但政府財政究不能不問人民負担的能力，而且尤不應忽視稅源的培養。此次市政府所提出的預算，據報紙記載，其總數達二千三百億元，其中除一千二百三十一億屬於經常收入來充抵外，有八百六十九億元，占預算總數三分之一。須賴臨時收入補充。在工商業衰落的今日。對於這個數字龐大預算的提出，我們希望市參議會千萬要審慎考慮。其中涉及必要之市政建設者，自應予以維持；其有用以維持駢枝機關保留冗員者，自應予以刪棄。上海雖為全國第一都市，但關於市政的組織，原有法令可循；其有不照規定之機關員役，自應予以裁汰，以節公帑。</p>
<p>至於如何整頓稅收，以裕室庫，此在市財政當局，固應有通盤計劃，而在市參議會尤應審慎審議。現在上海市民所負的稅捐擔負，往往已不勝負荷。如果再有新稅的增加，足以影響一般市民的生活的，則必將招致一般市民的反感。當此民主凋敝之會，對於新稅的增加，尤應審慎將事。如何增裕市庫，與其從增加新稅着想，實毋寗積極整頓現有的稅收。現在稅捐的徴收，有無流弊，是否可以改善，在在都值得考慮。在稅捐的徴收上，尤應避免捐稅負擔的重複。過去市政建設捐的徴收，附加在房捐上，附加在自來水費上，附加在電費上，附加在電話費上，附加在煤氣費上，處處都有附加，一個市民很可能每月繳付五六種同項名目的建設捐，弄得無處無捐，無處無稅，是直集捐稅重複之大成，抑亦表示我稅制的病態。捐稅旣有建設的名目，而建設在那里，尤為一般市民所費解。上海的市財政應該是有辦法的；我們不應專從增加人民的負擔着想。</p>
<p>此外關於市政應與應革諸端，市長旣有入要案的提出，各參議員來自民間，深知民間疾苦，想亦必有議案的提出，由於此次參議會的召開，我們不但希望他們能為中國的地方自治樹一楷模，且將為此後中國的民主憲政樹一典範。如何積極發揮市參議會的效能，此次市參議會的召開，想必能有事實來慰市民的股望。</p>

<h3>塞外新長城　傳作義將軍會見記　（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　俞振基</p>
<p>抱着金飯碗要飯　傳將軍認為現在察哈爾的情形，無異「抱着金飯碗要飯」他說：日本在察省曾做了一些建設工作，但主要的只是將察省建成殖民地，吸取原料。日人在察建有五十八個工廠，並留下一部份調查材料。廠礦現大部已為共軍破壞，尤其是張家口，共軍一夜半天所造成的破壞，實在不是三五個月所能復興的。我們所拿到的只是些破屋爛機器。提起這些人，傳氏只是搖頭，頻頻說：「真大傷腦筋！」</p>
<p>傳將軍以頗為自傲的口氣說：察省鐵礦儲量之富，在全國僅次遼寗，宣化煤鐵礦，有着驚人的蘊藏量，且有現代熔鐵設備，預計兩三個月可以修復，屆時將以礦砂運往北平附近鍊鑄。此外，察省尚有若干雲母等稀有礦產。</p>
<p>農產方面：察省的小米小麥亦很著名，每天都由平綏路運若干到平津等地，只是缺乏好的電力設備，與全省都在一種刻苦精神之下，所以就是傳長官請記者團吃飯的桌上，饅頭花卷都不是上好的白麵做的。將軍本人以及在塲的好幾位廳長都一個接一個地吃，使來自京滬的記者不好意思不跟着吃。</p>
<p>目前察省最感缺乏的是電力，就在張家口，即有許多許多事業，眼看因為電力不夠，所以無法重建。傳將軍告訴我們，日本人在察省本有一個六萬五千瓩的發電計劃，在它無條件投降以前，已經完成了四萬瓩，但目前連一千瓩都不到，一切當然隨之陷於停頓。省府方面，已與資委會合作，設法使下花園的電廠能恢復，預計不久將來可增到一萬瓩，這樣對於陷於麻痹狀態的工業，當有極大的好處。</p>
<p>道路大部已修竣</p>
<p>另一件在傳將軍領導下進行的工作，是交通的修復。從張家口到北平，從張家口到大同的鐵路，已經在最近修復了，這條大動脈的重建，固然亦使市面上發現一些美國香煙之類，但山西與察省的物資都得以源源運出，河北平津的貨物亦不斷運來。公路方面，全省的道路大部已搶修竣事，從張家口到張北到庫倫，有着很好的公路。從張家口到崇禮的路，簸顛得厲害，但從這裏亦可見得未修復以前的破壞情形。所說，最初收復張垣時，有一輛十輪大卡車，從旁地洞來，走幾十天路後，十個輪子只剩了五個，還繼續走。當時路上滿是地雷，到處都是坑，而現在從長官部到飛機塲的一條大路，恐怕比南京到棲霞山，上海滬西到虹橋路一段還要平坦，這是我們在京滬一帶的人應該表示慚愧的。</p>
<p>傳長官這樣做，沒有在察省收一分稅，也沒有在察省抽一個丁，而為的是什麽，借他自己一句話，是要讓「每一個老百姓有飯吃」。這目標要達到固然非旦夕間事，但這種做法總是值得贊美的。</p>
<p>人民是他的力量</p>
<p>傅將軍及他的一　幕僚，在察省所幹的一切，其刻苦與奮鬥，真不是我們京滬人所能想得到的。記者在張垣時，曾問他，「察省要辦的事如此多，經費如何籌措？聽說貴省人才非常缺乏，對羅致與訓練人才這一點，敢問有何計劃？」傅氏聞言後，苦笑了一下，又搓了措手，沉沉的說：「開發察哈爾，根本就沒有錢，一個錢都沒有，羅至人才方面，我們已經擬了一個計劃。」</p>
<p>是的，察哈爾窮不堪言（指地面上的而言），但，省當局的建設計劃，照樣在進行，他們以什麽為其後盾？傅將軍在另一次談話中，給了我們答覆：他靠的是人民。他以說故事的口氣告訴我們：張家口的工人現在是如何的努力工作，如何的愛護他們的工廠。他說：「過去的破壞，提高了工人的工作情緒，對方的行為，增強了工人的愛廠心情，因為沒有工廠，才知道工廠的可貴，張家口廣播電台曾發生工人為保護機器而不惜犧牲性命的事。」</p>
<p>傅氏告訴記者：國軍是兩個前進駐張垣的，在這不算短的期間內，張垣從沒有發生一件搶案，甚至一些小糾紛亦沒有發生過。這是以證明人民是如何支持政府。</p>
<p>唯有愛人民，為人民福利打算的政府，才能得到人民真正的助力。傅氏在報告崇禮事件感想時，最後曾提到「今天中國人民太痛苦了，老百姓都過着非人的生活，我們應該快快幫助他們解決困難」。這種悲天憫人的心腸，已經獲得效果了。</p>
<p>張家口不但是察哈爾的首府，而且是全國邊防中心，該地的安危，不但影響整個華北，而且影響整個中國安危。鎮守在那邊防重鎮上的，除有萬里長城等天塹外，當有一堵用人民力量所建成的新的萬里長城，而為這一堵銅牆鐵壁中最堅強的一個，就是「每一寸都帶有老百姓氣質的」傅作義將軍。——元月四日追記於首都</p>

<p>從飛機聯想到航海安全</p>
<p>綜合此次飛機空前慘禍之原因雖因，氣候突變，而駕駛員之技術，以及飛機機件機塲之設備諸問題，容亦爲致禍之因素，假定人力可盡之事，俱臻完善，此次災禍，可以避免亦未可知</p>
<p>旣經發生之後，所謂慰問撫卹等，究於被難者與被難者之家屬，能有多少裨補，可以想見，輪船亦然。航業界　應深自警惕，勿專以圖利爲惟一目的，而忽於船舶適航條件，萬一不幸事一旦發生，船貨之損失，易於恢復，而遭難之生命，與被難家屬之損失，決非金錢可以補償，且輪船遇難之死傷率，較飛機更大，徵諸已往，一輪覆沒，生命動以百計，回想往事，不寒而慄，祭今之經營者對於給舶修理，祇求節省費用，趕緊船期，對於安全設備，極不重視。而主管機關，對於檢騐方面，亦甚寬弛，此皆足以致禍之因素。其最爲危險者，莫若乘客之超過規定限額，儎貨之超過儎重綫，至於船員之技術問題，就目前而論，高級如船長輪機長，自勝利復員以來，事實已能證明成績，惟次級船負，未能盡合水準，實爲目前最可慮之事，在船員本身，果應力求上進，而經濟充裕之公司，與其耗之於訓練其他人員，不若將次級人員，加緊訓練，而關於各船之安全設備，儘量補充。蓋船舶無論在航行或停泊，不能專賴船長一人之優越技術經騐，即二副三副，其責任之重要一也至於航行安全設備，吾國亦爲國際海上生命條約簽字國之一更不能忽視其所負之責任與義務也。基於上述種種，所期望於各方面者，再分別簡言之：（一）輪船公司幸勿專以營利爲唯一目標，而忽略一切應有之設備，類如羅盤，測水器，錨鍊，無綫電機，天文儀器，滅火器，救生具等，均應配齊配足，務使伴件可用，稍有損壞應立即更換，以防萬一。（二）主管機關，對於檢騐船舶，審覈船員，應予嚴格，而客貨超過限量，務必於開航前，嚴格取締，尤其對於航行近海之小型輪船，須特別注意，明文皆有規定，但在能執行耳。（三）軍隊乘輪，高級長官，對於該輪可容人數，應加注意，裝卸軍械彈藥以及在輪煮飯之地位，必須妥愼選擇，登輪之後，行駛及停留時地，悉應遵從船長意旨。（四）乘客如遇輪船遭逢危難，皆應力持鎭靜，悉聽船長指揮，不得亂竄。</p>
<p>倘能各方面通力合作，加以船員嚴守紀律，動於檢點，俱以「安全第一」爲目標，時時刻刻，如履薄冰，則舉凡人力可避之災禍，縱令不可避免，亦可减少損失，反之，則雖曰天災實由人造也，防患應在未然，敢爲交通當事進一言。（陳天駿）</p>
<p>轉復嘉興沈文嘉君</p>
<p>來函指陳嘉興站員處理受槍傷之旅客失當一則，經轉京滬區鐵路管理局後，頃接該局運務處函聞：「本案經電飭嘉興站站長復稱：『查本年七月十六日下午四時左右，有旅客邵文漢睡於藤榻，由其家屬及福音醫院醫師陳家鑣伴同抬送來站，據云係於早晟玩弄手槍，傷及腹部，擬乘西湖號車送申投醫。職當時察看該客傷勢甚重，按之路章，重病在中途有死亡之危險及傳染病者，均不准搭車，然爲救人生命起見，故即應允。惟據該醫師聲稱：該傷客不可轉動及行走，必須連同籐榻抬入車廂。職即善言解說，西湖號內部容積狹窄，藤楊難以安置，車門狹小，更無法抬入，祇可改乘下次62次車，並允設法將藤榻安置行李車中，時間方面，亦不過遲，的二小時而已。同時並詢問該醫師，如該傷客受車行之震動傷勢加劇，是否中送有死亡之虞，貴醫師是否護送至申，以便隨時急救？答云：此時難以逆料，本人亦因有要事，不克護送，祗有家慶伴送。職見該醫不肯負責，因昧於醫藥，設或中途死亡，則誰負責任，故即電請嘉興診療所薛兆基唐人競兩醫師到站診斷，據該兩醫師之意見，彈中腹部，子彈未穿出，傷勢非輕，若經二三小時之車行震動，中途是否危險，亦難斷定，故由其家屬與陳醫師之會商，中止赴申，即轉送嘉興浙江省立醫院診治。綜上事實，西湖號之未能搭乘，實限於該客不能轉動，須將連同籐榻抬入。至於西湖號車不能容納巨大籐榻，及車門之不能抬入，此係確切事實。職旣未予拒絕，並允彼改乘62次車赴申，亦可說盡扶助之責，該客由陳醫生伴同來站，薛唐兩醫師近在車站咫尺，電召即至何能言輾轉要求證明，故意留難，而加尤於人。彼旣決心赴申投醫，儘可改乘62次車，而臨時改送省立醫院，可證明傷勢險惡，自願放棄搭車主張，則與職站何允？至於該客送申定必護救，留禾必致於死，當時醫師亦未能確切保證，而以莫須有之罪，加之於人，更屬無稽。且此事已隔五閱月，設當時職有處置不當及故意留難，則該家屬早可控訴，何待遲至今日而作無謂之送登，此可見從中另有其人揑造事實，故意誹謗可知。總之，此事旣有本路薛唐兩醫師之證明，死亡之眞因，省立醫院亦有事實可稽，實非空言所能入人於罪也。』查核所陳，尙無不合，復請察照。」特達。</p>

<h3>莫斯科會議召開期近　德國問題經緯</h3>
<p>德國蘇軍佔領區在工業上已接近崩潰的程度，情勢之嚴重，迫使蘇聯不得不在今冬之前對德國問題作一重大決定，那就是還是贊成英美的計劃將德國統一起來呢？還是不顧一切犧牲將德國東部實行蘇維埃化呢？</p>
<p>蘇聯搬走德國工業</p>
<p>蘇區內的大部份重工業配備已經搬到蘇聯去，剩餘的一部份工業不足以生產人民大衆日常所需的物品。重要原料如煤斤與鋼鐵的極度缺乏，正迫使德國東部的許多工廠停工。假如蘇區的經濟竟告崩潰，則蘇聯爲爭取德人友誼而作的種種努力，必將遭遇一大嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>蘇聯不但把許多工廠配備以賠償名義搬運到蘇聯去，同時還把剩餘工廠的產品也用同樣的名義搬走。蔡司伊康光區儀器製造廠的製造品，幾乎全部輸往蘇聯，紡織品也幾乎全部支派給蘇聯的，而原料的缺乏，使這些工廠的生產也與日俱减。</p>
<p>蘇區原料極為缺乏</p>
<p>蘇聯物資原料缺乏的基本原因，乃是爲了德國現由四個佔領國家分區佔領，致使經濟上不能打成一片之故。蘇區的工業，大部份依賴魯爾區的煤和鋼，該區現在英國人手中。蘇方亟需魯爾區的煤斤，頃已同意將德境全部煤斤分四份推派，惟堅持煤斤生產的設計工作，亦須由四國共同決定。英國當局則堅主蘇方必須先行同意將德國全部工業置于統一管理之下，不然蘇聯的主張就無法照辦。</p>
<p>因此蘇聯祇有兩途可循：如其不向別處地方去設法煤和鋼。蘇聯可以向波繭想法，不然就得從本國運載煤和鋼前往德國。設若出此一着，則對蘇聯整個經濟系統，將成一極重的負担。</p>
<p>今後德國東部的經濟命運如何，胥視蘇聯和英美磋商的結果而定。</p>
<p>英美反對蘇聯措置</p>
<p>英美反對蘇方將德境蘇區的工業製成品運往蘇聯，聲稱波茨坦協定中所規定的賠償對象，以參與戰爭努力的各工廠設備爲限，戰後一般工廠的產品不在此一範圍之內。這些製成品的輸出，應用以償付必要的輸入品和佔領費用，英美兩國年費數百萬美金把必要的物品輸往德國，以供英美區的民衆應用，假如蘇區內有剩餘物品可以輸出，則應由四國共同管理，藉以减輕各國的經濟負担。</p>
<p>但是蘇聯方面却說英美根據協定應自德國西部拆卸而運往蘇聯的工業配備，已交出者爲數極少，且工作進行非常遲緩，因此英方並無將蘇區產品交出的責任。此外，蘇聯還堅持一點，就是政治上的統一必須先于經濟上的統一。英美和蘇聯對于德國問題意見的出入，大致如此。</p>
<p>抑有進者，法國的主張對於德國總統一也是一種阻礙。她認爲在參加討論統一工作之前，德國西部的國境必先予以確定。法國要求將薩爾區歸爲己有，並使魯爾區與德國分離，藉以保證德國不致再度興起，從事侵略戰爭。法國須俟其東部國境的安全獲得保障後，始能考慮下一步驟，不然就反對討論德國的統一問題。</p>
<p>英美方面曾欲和蘇聯進行磋商，將德境法區除外，先就英美蘇三區的合併工作舉行談判，然而亦吿失敗，結果造成了蘇聯在德國東部採取獨斷獨行的政策。</p>
<p>蘇區工業分為三類</p>
<p>德境蘇區的工業，蘇聯當局現已將其分成三類，分別管理。其中一部份是由德國地方政府管理而由蘇軍司令部加以監督的，此等工廠包括原屬納粹份子所有以及曾爲德國戰爭機構服役和僱用過俘虜做工的在內。　另一部份工廠則專爲條軍製造配備。製造特種武器如火箭彈之類的工廠，也由蘇軍加以管理。然而蘇區的軍火配備生產，爲數並不很大，反之，蘇聯本國內的軍火生產則有增無已。</p>
<p>再有一部工廠是中蘇維埃工業組合管理的。大多數重要的工業，都在其管理範圍之內，就是目前由蘇軍管理的許多軍火工廠，最後也要移交給工業組合接管。這些工廠都被認爲賠償品，目前所以依然留存於德國者，無非是爲了利用蘇聯本國內所缺乏的熟練人員。這中間，包括紡織廠，化學藥品廠，機械廠，燃料廠和公用事業等等。</p>
<p>蘇聯須作最後抉擇</p>
<p>這些工廠是否將繼續留於德國，以便使德國東部蘇維埃化，抑或以賠償品名義運往蘇聯，抑或在討論德國統一問題作爲討價還價的張本，目下尙在未定之天，惟有莫斯科可以作此決定。但鑒於四强外長會議今春即將在蘇京召開，以及德境蘇區經濟情形的日益嚴重，蘇聯在不久將來應該作一最後的抉擇了。（亞農譯自「世界報吿週刊」）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕今年度本市地價稅之預算，聞已確定為一百二十億元，征收之地區較之去年增加楊思，塘橋，洋涇，陸行等四區。因地價今年須重估，故預計實收數額，可能達二百億元。又三十五年度之地價稅征收，因技術上之必要，決定延期至本月廿四日截止。稅收截至一月四日為止，本市僅黃浦等六區，已收足三十一億元，超過預定數額。有關人士認為加上敵偽產業地價稅十二億五千萬元，至截止之日，總計可能高至五十億元。</p>

<h3>從事工業奮鬥不輟　新年訪吳蘊初　暢談一年來工業復員感想　檢討全國各地工業區情形</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕中國目前不安定的經濟局面不適宜於辦工業，但是「風雨如晦，雞鳴不已」，工業家仍在奮鬥不輟，在這批鬥士之中，吳蘊初無疑地是代表之一。記者昨天走訪這位白髮蒼蒼和易近人的老工業家，來表達新年之賀意外，詢問他對於一年來工業復員的感想。他表示對於這個問題，手頭沒有數字作精確的答覆，但他的天廚廠在全體努力下之下，不過恢復了四分之一，滬西的天源還沒有開工，天利廠因為缺電，復工尚未有期。在戰時，他本有在新疆設廠的雄心，而且有相當的準備，但是新省當時尚在盛世才統治之下，林靈庸案的發生，使他們發生了安全的顧慮。以後省府人事雖有更動，但是有背景的伊寗事變，使天山南北的形勢，更陷於動蘯之中，新疆省政府原定實施的紡織廠建立大計亦擱了淺，私人辦廠更談不到了。「我工廠所遭遇到的困難，中國其他工業亦同樣的遭受着」。</p>
<p>外來壓力未能例外</p>
<p>他指出我們工業復中的速度，正受着內外各項不利因素的限制。除了一般大局之外，物價太高，開支太大，是一個最大的原因。吳氏笑着說：儘管漂白粉沒有銷路，但造兩個製漂白粉塔，代價就得四萬萬元。此外，舶來品給本國工業的壓力極大，在化學工業部門亦非例外。譬如漂白粉，一桶美國漂白粉售價港幣九元，但是國貨的成本加倍還不止，在這種局面之下，造成了漂白粉往海裏倒的慘劇！檢討全國各工業區的情形，他說東北大規模的工業很集中，但因軍事未結束，秩序不安定，復員工作尚未着手。臺灣有低廉的電力，和其他優越的條件，復員工作已開始，但市上尚未有臺貨發現。記者問他對於本年內工業的展望，他說如大局不開朗，難有很大的希望。</p>
<p>日本工業尚難全復</p>
<p>談話從本國工業的復員問題，很自然的轉到日本工業的復蘇。吳氏的態度是很沉着的，他並不一味誇大危機。他的觀察是：日本大規模的化工業仆九與軍事有關，這些不能在今年完全恢復；不過過去製造硝酸的工業，今後將履行肥田粉，這是美國希望日本用來改善民生的。在日本對華的工業賠償物資中，化工的器材甚少，大部是屬於液體燃料方面。不過這些賠償物資如何消化利用，對於我們是個大問題。一噸的運費至少要法幣一百萬元，一所規模宏大的工廠至少有一千噸以上的器材；為數就很可觀，再加上必需的流動金和建築費，一般民營工業就無法負担。這許多實際的考慮過去使民營工業對於申報損失不很熱心，以致顧維鈞大使首次對美提出的損失報告，數字來得特別小，現在我們的損失統計比較完備了，但是美國對於日本的態度已經很是友好了。</p>
<p>消弭危機應共負責</p>
<p>談到政府的工業政策，吳氏認為政府是相當能接受民間的意見，不過經這危機的因素太多。目前的生產貸款對於工業界助力甚大，但是希望辦理得公平。進口許可制度亦是保護民族工業的辦法，問題亦是在實行。他認為有許多地方，責任應由各方面負担。例如上次的改訂匯率，政府的決策是不錯的，當時市政府召集本市工商界代表，請他們協助平抑物價，以免影響社會秩序。但是事後未進口漲價，已進口者亦漲，在這種事件上，公平的說，責任是在各方面的。</p>
<p>國營民營效率比較</p>
<p>記者詢問吳氏，對於經濟部改變資產估價辦法的意見。他說這是合理的措置，過去在重慶生產會議時就提出過，以增加倍數而論，亦是近於實情，但是百分之二十的現金增資，一般工業恐不能負担。同時在這個辦法之下，等於官方承認工業無錢可賺，以後利得稅就成了問題。關於敵偽工廠的處理，這位老工業家亦發表了不少精彩的意見，歸納他的話：是敵偽工廠的估價是在去年春天，而　出則在秋冬，物價是日新月異，但是估價不變，因之接收的工業家，如能善加運用，不會是賠本的交易。至於國營民營這個大問題，他的看法與一般民營工業家有別。他說：在資本主義的社會中，因利己動機的刺激，民營的效率比較高，國營的效率無可諱言的比較低，但是世界的趨勢是向社會化的路上走！我贊成不論國營或民營都要公司化，股票能公開在市塲上買賣，今天是國有的，明天可成私有，如此國營民營之爭，不解決而自解決！</p>
<p>捐資充作科學研究</p>
<p>吳氏在勝利之初，宣布以自己握有的股票，捐出作為研究化工的基金，並組織保管委員會加以保管和運用。記者問他這筆基金為數多少？預備如何使用？他的回答是：他握有天廚天源兩廠百分之四十的股票，時值大概在一百億元左右。目前工廠旣已復工，基金已有收益，至於使用問題，過去已有顧問團起草計劃，將來保管委員會開始工作後，一切計劃自能逐步實施。一個成功的實業家捐巨資作科學研究，在外國是常事，在我國是創舉，我們希望他在這方面能做一個成功的先驅者！</p>
<h3>劉行鎮上發現　大批化緣和尚</h3>
<p>前日下午賣出縣屬之劉行鎮，忽然發現大批化緣和尚，數約三十餘人，混入鎮內，當局以其人數眾多，行蹤詭秘，遂如數加以扣留候究。</p>
<h3>言慧珠舊案重提　劉將軍拘押到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕此間報載，前年勝利之初，隨軍來平之中將劉某，　與坤伶言慧珠發生風流案（　伶僧因此自殺），事洩離平，轉調他職，後獲機渡美染造。近最高當局飭主管機關調劉主管機關調劉回國歸案。適訓啓程返國，在舊金山為美機捕獲，押回上海，現在羈押於某軍事機關。此案發生之初，因「劉」「呂」同音，曾被誤為前十一戰區北平前進指揮所主任呂文貞而風傳一時。</p>
<h3>越江工程問題　將作最後決定　多數主張　建築隧道　約需經費七百六十億　地點在中正東路外灘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市越江工程，於去年六月間，由上海市越江工程委員會委託中國橋樑公司辦理設計及鑽探工作，並規定分為二期進行。第一期工作包括選擇及測繪地址，並將研究結果編具報告，送越江工程委員會研究決定工程應取之地址及式別。第二期工作包括鑽探選定地點之浦江地質，設計工程圖樣，編製工程預算，擬定工程計劃，並準備招標及發包手續。中國橋樑公司已於去年八月間撥到設計經費，開始第一期工作，經研究結果，擬定越江工程方式四種：（一）建築隧道穿過黃浦江底。（二）建築高架固定橋樑，使高桅船隻可在橋下通過。（三）建築低架活動橋樑，在規定時間啓閍閔，通過船隻。（四）在浦江上游建築固定式橋樑，僅使中型船隻通過，高桅船隻限定在橋位下游地段停泊。</p>
<p>經市工務局局長趙祖康於上週中召開越江工程第二次技術小組顧問委員會，顧問委員源，鄭華，朱國洗，黃炎，陳逸民，康立脫，等討論後，認為隧道及低架活動橋二式較為適合，且建造費較廉。據中國橋樑公司之估計，建築隧道約需經費七百六十億元，橋樑則需經費四百十二億元。</p>
<p>地點決定兩處</p>
<p>關於越江工程選擇地址之條件，決定如下：（一）不能離開市區太遠，以免道路紆迴，影響多數過客之時間及費用。（二）聯接引橋之道路，須於原運輸量之外，更能吐納過江車輛。（三）引橋或走道位置，須能不妨附近及垂直方向之原有交通系統。（四）施工時對已成建築物，儘量減少損壞。（五）完成後引橋不遮蔽兩旁房屋之光線，或阻塞兩邊居民之出入。（六）隧道出口須不受高潮時江水倒灌之影響。（七）施工時及完成後對水上交通阻礙必須最少。</p>
<p>又越江工程之建築地點，初步討論決定如下：（一）保留中正東路外灘為建造隧道地點。（二）假定十六鋪為建造活動橋樑地點。</p>
<p>隧道節省時間</p>
<p>記者特於昨午走訪工務局工程結構處處長朱國洗，詢以橋樑與隧道得失比較若何。據朱氏答稱：技術小組顧問委員中多數之意見，均傾向於建築隧道。因為隧道之建築雖耗資較鉅，然對交通上之裨益亦大，為一勞永逸計，交通之調劑，勢非賴於隧道不可。活動式橋樑建築後，車輛及船隻之通行均須受時間上之限制，而隧道則可節省時間，且無斜坡之阻力。現該技術小組顧問委員會對於橋樑與隧道已作詳細之比較，於本月十五日工務局召開第三次會議時，當可作最後之決定。</p>
<p>經費絕無問題</p>
<p>關於越江工程之經費問題，聞擬採用土地徵值法。因越江工程告成後，該工程對江周圍約一公里土地，直接受惠後，地價必將增高，或由原地主補繳其增值，或由公家以原價收買後，以增值轉售。其增值以十倍計算之。則工程之經費即可無虞。且越江工程一旦決定，聞中國銀行等皆願投資。故經費絕無問題。</p>
<p>又據水利專家之估計，越江工程之建築，約需時一年。</p>
<h3>靜安寺郵局同人　舉行新年聚餐會</h3>

<h3>槍傷警士案　小麻皮就逮　供出曾犯案數起</h3>
<p>（本報訊）徐家匯警分局正副分局長柏德馨，許國樑據密報謂，有悍匪小麻皮係上月二十四日晨，在中正西路富民路口，開槍擊傷靜安寺分局八一五號警士寶昌濤之正犯，現匿居法華鎮。柏局長據報後，立飭第二股股長　詠韶，牽同股員孫尚耕，便警馬士藩，尹夢飛，趙春普，張守正等，於前日下午四時半，化裝馳往守候。未幾果見小麻皮到來，各警員即奮勇上前將其抱住。在該匪身畔抄出盒砲一支，子彈八發，均已登膛。遂帶回分局嚴訊。據稱名王有榮，三十一歲，泰州人，對於槍傷警士寶昌濤，直認不諱。並又供出犯有盜案數起，先後在大通路新一里三三〇號方姓家，山海關路一一〇號朱根富家，卻得金飾法幣與同黨朋分化用。</p>
<h3>美軍汚辱女生案　曁大約大教授　發表書面意見　要求迅速處理預防重演</h3>
<p>本市曁南，聖約翰兩大學教授劉大杰，高君珊，張耀翔，沈有乾，俞慶棠，王國秀，劉咸，錢鐘書，孫貴定，陳選善，王成組，余楠秋，陳科美，黃嘉德，胡祖蔭，左任俠，蔣載華，黃嘉音等，對美軍姦汚北大女生事，發表書面意見稱，這一次北平美兵強姦中國女生的案件，實在是一種無可原諒的暴行，凡是中國人民，對於這一種非禮的行動，沒有不表示悲憤與抗議。美軍在抗戰期中所給與中國的援助與同情，我們固然表示感謝，但由於這一類美軍的行為，無疑的要喪失中國人民對於美國的好感。在中美人民合作的精神上，不能不說是一種嚴重的損失。我們要求政府向美國負責當局提出嚴重抗議，在最近期內，公佈事實的真相，嚴懲兇手，賠償損失，公開道歉，更重要的是要政府方面採取最有效的方法，預防這一類暴行的重演。同時我們要求美軍的負責人，在這帬情憤激之中，用最公正的態度，最迅速的方法，處理這一案件，而且要設法來挽回這一次中國人民對於美軍所喪失的同情。</p>
<h3>反暴動聯合總會　告各界書</h3>
<p>本市各大學學生所組織之「上海大學生反暴動聯合總會」，昨為反對少數學生假借抗議美軍暴行名義，企圖煽動罷課，罷市，罷工，擾亂社會秩序，昨特發表告各界同胞書，原文如下：「諸位同胞，北平不幸事件之發生，沈君遭受侮辱，我全國上下，深為憤怒。當此事件傳遍全國時，各地各大學，業已發出正義之呼籲與慰問，並罷課一天，以示抗議，及要求嚴懲兇手，賠償損害，及保證以後不再有同樣事件發生。美軍當局現已全部接受。此事當督促政府，期待圓滿結果。事態發展至此，本可告一段落，迺本市有少數陰謀份子，不肖之徒，想利用此不幸事件之發生，擴大其歪曲宣傳，作為反美運動之工具，企圖煽惑各界同胞，引起罷課，罷市，罷工等行動，以破壞社會秩序之安寗。本會有鑒於斯，特揭破其陰謀，並勸告各界同胞，勿為不良份子所利用。蓋北平一美軍，侮辱女學生事，純係法律問題，不能與政治問題混為一談。美軍一人之過失，決不能代表整個美軍之行動。中美邦交素來甚厚，更不能因一個美軍之過失，而使中美友誼喪失。今美軍當局，旣已全部接受我國所提之要求，我們何能再有任何苛刻之條件。敬希各界同胞，態度鎮靜，認清事理，萬勿受陰謀份子之煽動，而盲從行事為幸。我們的口號是：（一）反對各黨派利用學生，作政治鬥爭的犧牲品。（二）各黨派應立即退出學校。（三）請求政府迅速懲辦兇手。（四）打倒煽動「罷課」「罷工」「罷市」，破壞社會秩序的暴徒。（五）請不要只顧了黨派的利益，而置民族國家於死地。（六）美軍的暴行當以法律外交來解決。</p>

<h3>抗戰文獻展覽會　一個警惕的回顧</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕八年艱苦抗戰，勝利結束還僅年餘，而過去的仇恨，創痛和恥辱，卻似乎已被生活的重壓淹沒了。抗戰文獻展覽會的揭幕舊事重提，給予我們一個警惕的回顧。</p>
<p>在這次的展覽會中，可以看到抗戰期中善與惡三種相反的力量：一種是正義的力量，一種是侵略者的力量，還有一種就是附逆者為虎作倀的力量。</p>
<p>在起初，第一種力量受到相當慘酷的打擊。在砲火的光影中，看到整個受難的上海：閘北的大火，瓦礫堆中的復旦大學，拉鋸戰中失而復得的羅店，以及在彈藥氛圍巾另一種最緊要的工作，救護和掩埋。這些都具有一種悽厲的情調。其次，我們看到了淞滬的撤退，四行孤軍的圍守，地下工作者在敵人鐵綱中的掙扎苦鬥，敵人和「七十六號」的酷刑。這兒有劉志剛受到毒素注射後的恐怖面目，姜夢麟受傷後割下的右賢，以及無數堅貞不屈者的屍骸和血迹……可是慢慢的，這種恐怖氣氛，終於在勝利的陽光中消散了。五色繽紛的畫報，舉國歡騰的慶典，以及憲兵隊和警備部的皇皇佈告，在另一種歡欣空氣中，結束了八年抗戰的歷程。</p>
<p>要明白敵人侵略我國的媒介，便當注視奸逆背叛祖國的活動。在走廊中陳列着許多照片中，我們看到一種恐怖的靜寂，一種麻醉的狂歡。敵偽口是心非的標語，是虛偽親善與奴化宣傳的鐵證。我們看見敵偽罪魁的歡宴，所謂大東亞文學代表會議，和附逆書畫家的作品展覽，我們也看見敵偽的搜括金屬和強制收買棉布，以及一塲戲劇式的大打賭塲。這兒充分表現出敵人與奸偽之間的磨擦和矛盾的醜態。</p>
<p>第二陳列室中所陳列多的，半是抗戰期中敵偽遺下劣蹟。汪逆的宣戰中令，以及淪陷區內紊亂經濟的渣滓，如軍票　中債券，店鋪印行的零找小票等等此外還有日人的古代宗教儀式，古代的甲胃塑像等，使我們對於日本民族的傳統氣質有一種認識。同時還啟示，日本雖已失敗，而我們卻不能無視於日本被壓抑了的侵略野心。</p>
<h3>書業請願代表　今日再度晉京　各地同業紛紛響應</h3>
<p>書業為請求免徵營業稅事，經該業一再召開緊急會議，商決再度晉京請願。茲悉該代表團李伯嘉·鄭農山·陸寶忠·周熙和·徐伯昕·劉季康·姚蓬子·汪孟鄒·蔣振湛等一行二十人，決於今日晉京，再度分向財政部直接稅署等有關機關，面遞呈文，力爭免除全部營業稅，並要求對文化事業，予以緊急有效救濟。又聞該書業公會自通電全國各地同業，希望一致力爭，現已先後接得漢口·長沙·衡陽·杭州·寗波·蚌埠·開封·重慶·溧陽·青島·懷寗（安慶）·江都·南昌·經縣（安徽）等地同業公會來電響應，均一致堅持全部免徵營稅，否則不惜任何犧牲，願為後盾云。</p>
<h3>高生大貶價售貨　勞資間情感融洽</h3>
<p>本市高生大祗號，前因攤販案被暴徒兩次搗毀後，生財貨物損失慘重，至今仍無力繼續營業。全體職工因大部係數十年之老工友，平日與資方感情融洽，故雖停業已久，均抱甘苦共嘗之旨，不願離去。該店主近以廢歷年關在邇，為維持職工生活計，定於今日起將所存之帳簿紙張等廉價出售，俾將所得，勞資共渡凋年。</p>
<h3>律師吳履平　檢舉其婦吸毒</h3>
<p>律師吳履平，家住林森東路第四弄六號，昨晨投泰山分局司法股報告稱：渠與無錫婦人張素芬，（卅七歲）同居迄今，已有二十年，平時情感甚洽，生有三男三女，不料近年來，發現張素芬犯有鴉片嗜好，時常潛至九畝地燕子窠，吸食鴉片，惟因行蹤詭秘，故該燕子窠所在地，無從探悉。最近伊更不知自悔，竟將家中衣飾，典質殆盡，經我發覺譴責，伊竟反唇相稽，因是不得已投案檢舉，應請傳案依法訊辦云云。張股長據報，立飭員　將張素芬傳案訊審。據張氏供稱：以前因產後患病，確曾吸過，今則早經戒絕斷癮，實因夫有外遇，向索開支不遂，故而投案檢舉云云。張股長乃諭以張氏是否有毒，不能憑信，聽候送往醫院調騐後，再行核辦。</p>
<p>光陸戲院小糾紛　無票看戲起衝突</p>

<p>中國的戲劇，也像語言一般，各地不同，所謂南詞北曲，越調泰腔，多是以地名劇，即過去風靡一時的崑腔，今日流行的皮簧，都是從地方劇演變而來的。地方劇的劇本，是一種通俗文學，脫胎於農民所唱的山歌俚曲。所以最初的地方戲，是俗粗簡　，只能在草台班上演出，不登大雅之堂。迨後一經文人潤色，宛如村姑走進了都市，凃脂抹粉地妝飾起來，劇木的辭句，伴奏的音樂，道具服飾等等，都十分講究了，於是由小戲一變而爲大戲。再從局促一隅的小城市，推廣而及附近各縣，以至省城京師，地盤慢慢地擴大子，觀衆逐漸普遍，從此再不目爲地方戲。這種進化過程，平劇是最好的例子。</p>
<p>上海自開埠後，成爲五方雜處的大都市，各地的人，都來觀它，因此供各地人消閒的地方劇，也在上海普遍地流行着。早年的崑曲，晚近的皮餐，早已失去了地方劇的性質，姑置不論，至於純粹的地方劇，過去都集中在遊戲塲裏，間或在茶樓上演出，說不到有什麼地位，觀衆主體爲小市民，即使偶有堂會，也不會多的。</p>
<p>經過八年抗戰，娛樂界也改觀了。號稱負有文化使命的話劇，總是不能呌座，百年來獨　的平劇，也趨於沒落，而地方劇却很幸運地發展起來。最初是申曲奪取了蘇灘的地位，越劇也不甘示弱，竄了起來。北方的蹦蹦戲，不知曾風魔了多少人，到現在，蹦蹦戲已掩旗息鼓了。申曲和越劇，却從茶樓走入了戲院，四五年來，使無數太太奶　　　了着迷，迄今還算是地方劇中的兩大勁旅。</p>
<p>其他像在江　流行的彈詞和評話，北方的大鼓書等，雖未粉墨登塲，但也可算是地方劇一類，在上海都曾表演過。不過純　北方風味的大鼓書，相聲，墜子等，只能偶爾抬頭，不能持久。到是彈詞和評話，抓着大量的觀衆，尤其在無綫電盛行之後，逐漸擴展其勢力，在地方劇中，要　是重要之一環。</p>
<h3>衰落的蘇灘</h3>
<p>灘簧也可說是很普遍的地方小戲，現在流行的申曲，原名本地灘簧。越劇也是灘簧的化身，此外又有杭州灘簧，寗波灘簧種種不一。蘇灘在過去更是紅極一時，全盛時代的王美玉，風頭之健，遠在今日姚水娟袁雪芬之上。的確，蘇灘在各地方小戲中要算比較文雅的，雖然內容也很淺薄俚俗，但沒有淫穢不堪的地方，很少低級趣味，而以表演滑稽，說唱時調小曲，來博取觀衆的好評，可說是又高尙而又通俗的娛樂，但其沒落的原因，也未始不因「高尙」二字所致。</p>
<p>蘇灘爲崑曲改編而成，崑曲所有者，蘇灘也大多有之，但曲文却不如崑曲的典雅，多半平易通俗，說白幾與崑曲相同。樂器沒有鑼鼓，也不用笛，祇用絲竹伴奏，角色有生，旦，凈，丑之分。至於劇本，有本頭戲和齣頭戲之別，本頭戲像杜丹亭，琵琶記，占花魁等，均是長本。齣頭戲乃從長本戲中截取而來，像斷橋，戲叔，思凡等，均是正戲，稱爲前　。另有一種獨立短劇，偏於滑稽，旨在逗笑取樂，如馬浪蕩，賣橄欖等，名爲後灘。</p>
<p>創於清末吳縣錢氏</p>
<p>據說蘇灘創於淸末吳縣　士錢明樹。錢擅崑曲，因有慨於曲高和寡，乃別出機杼，改典雅之崑曲，爲通俗之蘇灘，故前灘實爲錢灘之誤。其實灘簧在乾隆年間已有了，錢氏改編幾齣，正與今日文人，爲伶人改編劇本根同，不能謂之創製。但這種地方小戲，經過文人的手筆，自然與衆不同，何况錢氏又擅長崑曲，所以過去蘇灘之興起，也非偶然的事。</p>
<p>蘇　在民國初年已很流行，早乍上海蘇　中最走紅的，要推范少山，那時上海蘇灘，幾乎全是范氏調派，范氏弟子，十佔七八。較范稍後的，還有一個筱桂孫，也很有名。當時蘇灘，都是坐着唱的。若加化裝，用戲劇的方式來演出的，稱爲化裝蘇灘，乃費西冷所創的新格。女子蘇灘，以王美玉姊妹爲最早，頗受人歡迎，營業大盛，於是蔣婉貞，施湘雲等紛紛繼起，造成了蘇灘的黃金時代。</p>
<p>申曲興起蘇灘衰落</p>
<p>申曲逐漸與起，而蘇灘則日趨衰落，到現在已被人打入冷宮，除在遊藝塲中略資點綴而外，已沒有人注意了。蘇灘的從業員，紛紛改行，班子也大多解散，所剩來下的，只有朱國樑幾個人，因編唱藝術卓越，故得支撑這破殘局面。蘇灘之所以沒落，並不是因爲觀衆愛好心理的變遷。乃因歷年來社會經濟轉變，許多有閒階級，需要更低級，更俚俗淫穢的東西，蘇灘旣不能迎合觀衆，沒落乃常然之事。</p>
<p>杭州灘簧，杭人稱之爲安康，寗波灘簧有時簡稱甬劇，在灘簧中，始終未見有特殊的進步，但亦能維持其原有地位。尤其是寗灘，因爲寗波人在上海金融界上，占有很大的勢力，不致於十分沒落下去。至於常州無錫等地，亦有灘簧，但其流行範鬨，祇限於隣近一帶，在上海並沒有多大聲勢。</p>
<h3>從東鄕調到滬劇</h3>
<p>「坐罷」番落起身，張家小女嘆終身，忽然想起心頭事，想起家務一段情，我爺娘勿養三男並四女，單養伲兄妹一雙人。……」</p>
<p>憂聽申曲的太太小姐們，差不多會哼上這麼一段。、申曲現稱滬劇，大約因爲滬劇兩字比較雅馴的緣故，在鄕村裏，却都稱之爲「灘簧」，又稱「本地灘簧」，表示和「蘇州灘簧」「寗波灘簧」有些區別。　申曲原是「東鄕調」，發祥地在浦東，所以直到現在，申曲中的語言還完全是浦東口氣。再前，就是「花鼓戲」了。光緒十年（一八八四年）出版的上海繁華小志中，有花鼓戲一詩云：「暢月樓中集女仙，嬌音唱出小珠天，聽來最是消魂處，笑喚寃家合枕眠。」</p>
<p>詩中所稱「小珠天」，即係申曲劇本之一，所以申曲之起源，賞在並不算晚，在當時申曲與花鼓戲幾乎混爲一談，但是花鼓戲有戲文表演，而申曲的「東鄕調」却只有腔調而沒有戲文。</p>
<p>花鼓</p>
<p>花鼓戲是一向被視爲　淫的東西，以其表演時的情景，唱詞，對白有不少挑撥色情的地方，一般人對這班唱花鼓戲的「戲子」多數瞧不起，演唱者亦因此名稱太不名譽，因此屢改名稱。乾嘉時代靑浦人諸聯著有「明齋小識」一書，其中有一條記花鼓戲，開頭便說：「花鼓戲傳未三十年，而變者屢矣！」</p>
<p>關於花鼓戲的出世年月，現頗難查考，但據上引「明齋小識」句，當可推斷在乾隆四十年前後。最初在白天扮演，後來改在夜間做。所用樂器，據淞南樂府中載：男敲鑼，婦打兩頭鼓，和以胡琴笛板。演員起先都是男子，後來女子也有參加了，不過花鼓戲的女演員中，有不少無行之女，這也成爲花鼓戲本身遭受不名譽的重要原因。毛對山墨餘錄記：「上海初　租界時，賣淫羣中，有花鼓婆。」足見當時情形一斑。</p>
<p>禁者自禁·唱者自禁</p>
<p>花鼓戲以淫穢而常被禁止，但因其通俗易曉，極受民衆歡迎，所以禁者自禁，而唱者自唱。民國二年，吳馨做上海縣知事時，曾委李綺爲通俗敎育事務所主任，組織通俗宣講國，其中就有「改良花鼓」一項。翌年，施蘭亭。邵文濱。胡雪昌等發起振新集，改名申曲，但內容呢，却是「一仍其舊」。</p>
<p>申曲的劇本有「大戲」「小戲」之分，像捉牙蟲，賣紅菱之類是小戲，陸雅臣賣娘子之類便是大戲了。小戲的情節很簡單，大都一男一女，打情駡俏，胡扯一陣。即以「捉牙蟲」一齣爲例；人物：小賊—男飾</p>
<p>捉牙蟲娘子—女飾</p>
<p>情節：路上相遇，小賊請捉牙</p>
<p>蟲，關亡，算命，看風</p>
<p>水，胡鬧了一番。</p>
<h3>落難公子中壯元　私訂終身後花園</h3>
<p>所謂「大戲」也者，當然指其情節比較複雜，人物也多些，還有些怖景道具之類。說穿了，其故事也是千篇一律，總是些「落難公子中狀元，私訂終身後花園」，到後來「奸臣都殺完，奉旨大團圓」，於是觀衆們揩乾了眼淚，笑嘻嘻的立起身來，走出戲塲塲……</p>
<p>申曲的唱詞，也和故事的情節一樣地呆板，譬如說開塲不是「坐罷一番落起身」便是「東方日出照窗紗」之類，形容走得快便是「三步改作二步行，行一里來過一村」，唱到某人將死，便是「閻王注定三更死，斷不留人到五更」，形容小姑娘年紀輕，一定是「二九挽郞十八歲」。……諸如此類，不一而足。腔調簡單，每句常是七字，完全用土白凑成，像「豪豪燥燥轉門庭」，「勿曾出帖配官人」，「肚裏忖咾心裏論」，「看罷一番身朝裹」等。像我們不大愛聽申曲的人，總覺得有點不耐煩。</p>
<h3>江湖河海清波浪　遠過逍遙達道通</h3>
<p>偶而在唱詞中也有「挖空心思」的，像許多大戲或小戲內，愛用偏旁相同的字，如「江湖河海淸波浪，遠過逍遙達道通』用到對聯的，如「虞夏商周漢，五百翰林千進士；唐宋元明淸，十三閣老九公卿」之類。還有像「小孤孀糶米」的開塲：</p>
<p>「香蓮碧水動風凉，水動風凉更日長，長日夏凉風動水，凉風動水碧蓮香」，那是用回文撰成的，雖然和正文簡直是「風馬牛不相及」，但這些「小噱頭」還能抓住許多觀衆。又如「陸雅臣求岳母」的一段，每句嵌茶葉名，「小分離」開塲旦唱的一段，每句嵌藥名，再如儘量的利用數字遊戲，也是申曲中特有的噱頭</p>
<h3>申曲</h3>
<p>申曲自農村侵入都市後，最初局處茶樓之中，因官廳取締，流氓滋擾，時演時輟。直至遊戲塲開設時，才得發展機會。但最初的遊藝塲，像「樓外樓」，還沒有申曲的塲子。迨後黃楚玖在泥城橋畔，倡辦新世界俱樂塲，知道有一部分遊客，喜歡聽聽本地戲，於是把申曲也羅致了去，其時時做「本灘」，因爲觀衆不多，戲　所在，都在小塲子裏，其後黃又開辦大世界，本灘始努力與蘇灘競爭，女主角　用女性演出，不再「男扮女妝」，並且利用化裝技術，申曲漸漸地走紅了。王筱新·施春軒·筱文濱·馬金生·朱泉根等，都是十幾年前申曲的紅角克，到現在，筱文濱·施春軒二人，還在領導滬劇，無綫電流行後，申曲利用播音廣吿，擴展其勢力，奠定了基礎。抗戰軍興，各種地方劇在孤島上勃興起來，申曲也不肯讓人，於是又從遊藝場走進了戲院。上海五百萬人，大都講本地話，純粹以土白演出的申曲，當然大受歡迎。加以商業的進展，市况的繁榮，其勢力自應有增無减。</p>
<p>但申曲基礎的脆弱，是無可諱言的事實，因此在上演時，劇本不好，唱腔，說白，台步等等平淡凌亂，太不講究，角色又雜，服裝不能配合，導演手法，毫無秩序，瑕處頗多。在現代戲劇正向新的去處邁進時，申曲的本身實在有加緊改良的必要，庶幾免於淘汰。這一點，申曲的演員與研究者應予努力，切不可抱殘守缺，摧殘了申曲的壽命。至於改良的辦法，不少先進的劇人，早有研究，不必筆者來嚕囌了，就此打住。</p>
<h3>蹦蹦戲　有着獨特的存在價値　希望從事通俗文學運動者　怎樣來加以整理加以改良</h3>
<p>提起了白玉霜，想老上海都能記得起罷。那時她在舞台上表演，不知有多少人着了迷。因起源約在唐山一帶。對於「蹦蹦戲」名稱的來源，大的是因爲戲中所用樂器，以梆子爲主，是一根硬木做成的圓條直徑的寸許，長的五六寸，另用一個木槌來敲。聲音異常響亮，「蹦蹦蹦」地，不絕於耳，所以稱為蹦蹦戲。起先與「玩把戲的」差不多，扮演者用梆子招集觀衆，在趕會或趕集的時候，隨處表演。其實呢，蹦蹦戲另有一個名稱，呌做「奉天評戲」，俗氣一點，就是「奉天落子」。</p>
<p>所謂　「評戲」，實在就是把「評書」舞台化而已，如「馬寡婦開店」中，馬寡婦每次上塲，照例有一句「來了佳人馬寡婦」，再如「杜十娘」「珍珠衫」等，下塲的人往往最後一句唱着「按下××且不表」，於是上塲的人接唱下去：「再表嬌娃×××」，這些十足表現着評書的形式，不過評書是一個人扮演許多脚色，而評戲則脚色分任，加上些梆子腔的唱詞而已</p>
<p>蹦蹦　戲的來源是評書，因此有許多特點是相同的，第一是「通俗」，詞句道白全用俗語，和平常口氣一樣，劇本的背景在什麼地方，就用那一地方的土話，一字一句，極易聽懂，因此婦人孺子都喜歡聽；第二是「細膩」，聽過評書的人，都知這說書人對所說故事擋墓的細則，　　戲也是如此，一房間的　成可以唱個三四百字，杜十娘被遣來後有幾大段唱詞，形容其心理上的演變。</p>
<p>優點　固如上述，但是缺點也非常之多，因其本身是封建社會的產物，整個是舊的形式，和舊的內容。譬如唱白有時俚俗不通，硬凑韻脚，舉個例吧，「大龍嫖院」裏有一段：「念過國文與歷史，修身地理全念齊，成詩著賦把文作，打鼓吹號把操體，高等小學曾畢業，現有文憑在箱裹」，這種「細膩」得實在不敢領敎，尤其是「把操體」一句，簡直不像話！這也可見其文化水準的低了。再如，劇詞前後不連貫，情節矛盾，所謂「全本」的戲，畫蛇添足的地方特別多，嚕囌討厭。就劇本本身的內容上說，都是些淫蕩的戲打諢之類，「意識」二字，根本談不到。但是，話說回來，蹦蹦戲也並不是眞正「不屑一顧」的東西，它雖不「大雅」，但也有着獨特的存在價値，成爲一種民衆的藝術，因此所希望的，是一般從事通俗文學運動的人，怎樣來加以整理，加以改良，用新約有意義約有生命的內容來代替那些舊的腐化的封建產物。</p>
<p>話題　轉到蹦蹦戲在上海的情形來：上海好比一隻大鍋，無論甜酸苦辣，都需要容納一些蹦蹦戲當然也要到上海來挨一份。最初，在民國十六七年的時候，大世界的雜要班中，曾有過一班蹦蹦戲，這恐怕是蹦蹦戲最早到上海的一班。但是演得不行，除了幾個「老鄕」以外，幾乎沒有人去過問。</p>
<p>蹦蹦戲在上海走紅，是在民國二十三年冬天開始的，蹦蹦戲旦角朱寳霞被人請到上海，在新世界樓下闢一「河北劇塲」，從此蹦蹦戲開始在上海單獨出演。民國二十四年，白玉霜因在北平表演，被當地市長以「妨蛄風化』的罪名驅逐到上海來，有人請他在中央大戲院登台，當時票賣一元，相當「吃價」，但因白玉　的表情風騷，頗能吸引一般色情觀衆，因此　蹦戲大紅特紅，而「馬寡婦開店」「槍斃小老媽」等戲，也遂爲上海市民所熱悉了</p>
<p>然而　蹦蹦戲所以能在上海走紅，全是色相號召的效力，淫詞蕩態，不堪入目，對蹦蹦戲的本身，委實是一個可悲的現象。到現在，上海人對於蹦蹦戲是　違已久了，誰都難得想到它蹦蹦戲已走入了沒落之途</p>
<h3>揚州戲</h3>
<p>揚州戲在上海，除在遊藝塲中所演出的「維揚班」外，也有專演這一種戲的院子數十家，他們大都設在小菜塲附近，或茶國之中，吸引了很多的觀衆，當然純粹是小市民。</p>
<p>揚州戲原是流行在北淮六邑的「鹽阜班」，所演的戲也都是兒女私情。每班人數不多，自十餘人至二三十人不等，有生有丑，角色齊全。他們從來不登廣吿，可是生意總很不錯，尤其每年正·二·三·三個月，幾乎無日不客滿。在冬天生意淸淡的時候，便設法換班，將兩院伶人，互相調換一下。或是來一次大會串，也說不定。最近泥城橋的「通商」，曾演過一次十二班合作的大會串。</p>
<p>揚州戲院是個多事的塲合，三光麻子可以自由出入，收票員假使沒有在馬路上闖過一番，休想來担任這項工作。爲了補票或不准入內而發生口角，是很平常的事。於是有白相人中的「大亨」之流，來當特殊顧問，院方雖損失了一筆薪金，却免去了許多麻煩。</p>
<p>在無綫電台上，維推戲也一度侵入，逐漸爲人重視。他正和別的地方戲一樣，庸俗，淺薄，淫穢，但富於低級趣味，故能把握住許多觀衆。</p>
<h3>風靡一時的越劇　全滬最盛時期　達三十家之多</h3>
<p>越劇和申曲，無疑地是今日海上地方劇的兩大壁壘，通俗的劇情，廣大的觀衆，居然風靡一時。典雅的崑劇固然沒落了，皮簧也成了强弩之末，越劇大有起而代之的雄圖。不過回想過去蘇灘，甬劇，蹦蹦戲的盛衰，越劇能否維持其久長的命運，尙在不可知之數。</p>
<p>越劇普通稱作紹興戲，其賞並不發源於紹興，而是在紹興鄰近的嵊縣。假使說是紹興戲，那末有亂彈，有高腔，這纔時眞正的紹興戲。現在所流行的越劇，即通常所稱的的篤班，僅在諸暨嵊縣一帶演出，完全是農閒時期的民衆娛樂，劇情所以稱做「的篤班」，因爲他只用很簡單的兩種樂器，尺板和篤鼓的緣故。</p>
<p>越劇的誕生，祇有三十年的歷史。原爲地方上流行的一種歌曲小調，民國初年，有人把他改編，邀集了幾個同志，臨時拚桌成台，草草的扮演起來。雖很簡陋粗俗，但頗受當地農民的歡迎，於是成為風行一隅的小戲。酬神賽會，點綴熟鬧是少不了的。因情節簡單，不需要很多的人，所以很適宜於流動性的演出。每逢農隙，寒冬以後，淸明以前，出外表演。早年所費只三五元，已可演一全夜，有時甚至於單供給一頓飯就行了。</p>
<p>唱詞十分簡單</p>
<p>最初的越劇，大都由山歌小調改編而成，不免有誨淫之處，故爲官方所禁。但鄕間路途遙遠，　士耳目不周，禁者自禁而演者自演。後來演出的機會漸多，又新編了許多劇本，脫不了「私訂終身後花園，落難公子中狀元。」的窩白，色情意味肖厚，正因這點，才能迎合許多人的脾胃。</p>
<p>越劇的唱詞，十分單純，普通是七言和十言兩種，和彈詞很相近，也許就是由彈詞改編的。唱的時候，那冗長的尾聲，「哈啊哈啊」地要拖到十幾次，這是從高腔班蛻化而來無款。因爲最早除了拍節的尺板和篤鼓外，沒有樂器伴奏，演員乘機休息，不得不用人聲來替代過門。至於樂音方面，比以前複雜多了，除原有的鼓板之外，也有絲弦伴奏，胡琴已成爲必不可少的樂器。同時調子也新加了不少，越劇已不是那樣的寒酸相了。</p>
<p>清一色女演員</p>
<p>早年越劇演出，並不限於女子。大概有許多窮家，受農村衰落的影響，聯絡他們的女兒，在十二一歲至十七八歲之間，敎她們學戲，在附近鄕村出演，繼而出外營業，但同班仍有許多男子，不過女子演戲，更可迎合觀衆心理，就男子說本來知道她們是女子，在女子看來，却又當她們作男子，因此女子佔先，至今越劇已是淸一色女演員的世界。越劇旣受人歡迎，繼起者衆，嵊縣一地，約有七八十班，附近各地亦多請嵊縣敎師，前住敎戲，因而組班者，也不在少歟。久而久之，越劇已不是嵊縣人之天下了。</p>
<p>越劇從草台班而茶園而戲院，還是十年間事，不知交了什麼紅運，居然平昇三級。戰前在上海，越劇雖未列入遊藝塲的節目中，稱為紹興文戲，但並不能引起許多人的注意。閘北新疆路海寗路一帶的幾家的篤班戲館，也因受官廳于涉而時演時輟。民國廿五年所出版的新戲考中，尙未錄入越劇唱詞，可知還是默默無聞的。抗戰以後，勢力伸至戲院，遂奠定了他們穩固的地盤。</p>
<p>暴發戶的支持</p>
<p>越劇之所以能够平地飛昇，主要還在劇情的通俗，迎合觀衆。尤其是一般撈到國難財的暴發戶，他們想享受一黑娛樂，但過於高深的藝術，是他們所不能了解的，只有這種地方小戲，最配他們的胃口。同時越劇的故事，多演男女私情，充滿色情意味，又由女子來扮演，更可以滿足他們的欲望。越劇受這班暴發戶支持的力量眞不少，越劇的本身，也像暴發戶一般，突然興隆起來。</p>
<p>話又說回來，祇靠觀衆片面的支持，是不能持久的，越劇之有今日，亦因從業員的努力，時時改進。服裝方面，處處以皮簧為楷模，音樂逐漸由簡單而變為複雜，鑼鼓敲打，絲竹伴奏，都採用了。演技方面，竭力揣摹劇中人的心理。新編的劇本又很多，全不受舊劇本的拘束。她們旣在藝術上，下了一番苦功，其進步自然爲其他地方劇所不及。最近更利用話劇中的手法，如佈景燈光，甚至表情動作，處處加以研究，新編的「祥林嫂」，在許多越劇中，爲不同凡俗的作品，因此格外提高了越劇的身價。越劇的演員們，打着改良的旗幟，向光明的前途邁進。今在「質」「量」和」修飾」方面，已是脫胎換骨，愛好的人，當然要比以前多了。</p>
<p>漸減昔日盛況</p>
<p>全滬越劇塲在最盛時達三十家之多，使歷史悠久的平劇，負有文化使命的話劇，都則目而視。越劇果然是興起了，從小小浙東的農村裏，到處活躍踪跡遍於江浙兩省之間，杭紹寗波一帶，　地相接，早已傳佈，近來連江南蘇常一帶，也變為她們的地盤。上海成千成萬的觀衆，已不單是江南人士了。論其風靡一時，固値得傲視一切，但世事是循環的，盛極必衰，越劇班以「改良」爲號召，但所謂改良，眞正够得上標準的，反而賣座甚慘，這是使人百思而不得其解。一般的越劇院，也漸漸減却昔日盛況，停演之說，正到處醖釀着。可知越劇已　始收斂其數年來的光芒，頗有走向下坡之虞。</p>

<p>楊蔭溥談證交　新計話在草擬中　敵偽產業及外商股票　本年內大致均可上市</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪名經濟學家楊蔭溥氏，詢以各項問題，承分別答覆如下：（一）對工商業資產重估價辦法有何意見？楊氏認這此辦法之公布，這政府年來最賢明之措置。過去一般工商業最大之苦惱，這固定資產之價値不能與流動資金平衡。政府此項辦法宣佈後，無異這工商業開拓長期賢金之來源，使游資能加入生產工作，其意義固遠大於救急一時之生產貸款。今後工商業可順利增資，不致再受高利貸之威脅。大概在陰曆年關結賬之時，工商界即可感受此舉之良好影響。楊氏認為這五分之一之現金增資，實這必要，否則股東徒然因此新辦法而多取股票，而所經營之事業，資力將毫無增加。（二）證券交易所今年有何新計劃？新計劃正在草擬之中，今年之內，一部份敵僞產業之股票及外商股票大致均可上市。目前股票價格穩定，此乃良好現象。資產重估價辦法之宣佈，在長期內對於股票行情有新影響。（三）在目前之經濟情况下，是否適宜採取信用緊縮政策？答：在三四年前抗戰期內，物資缺乏，而通貨膨脹，故本人當時主張緊縮政策；惟在市塲利率甚高，而物價此較穩定時，信用緊縮政策將使工商業不勝高利貸之苦。綜言之，此項政策之是否正確，當取決於實際情形。（四）對今年之財政看法如何？政治經濟不可分，此時難作預測。但個人相信政府對開源胸有成竹，例如中紡國營時期原定這兩年，今已將江期，在必要時政府如將其股票出售，收入之大，即可驚人。至於幣制之改革，個人認這尙非其時，因使幣値不安定之因素，目前尙未消除。</p>
<h3>物價又上漲　社局派員澈查</h3>
<p>本市物價，去歲年底暴漲情形，經市社會局傾力壓制後，漲風稍戢，詎自新春以來，因廢曆年關迫近，人民需要增多，奸商乃業機蠢動，故連日物價又起波動，尤以食米一項，漲勢甚烈，市社會局以前車可鑒，這謀確切抑平物價，以期人民安渡年關起見，該局決動員物價管理科全體職員分赴各市塲，負賣監視交易，據該局經濟行政處負責人談稱：當局對抑平本市物價，具有最大決心，已一再申述前令，國曆年關雖已安渡，然廢曆年關則前途渺渺，深盼市民一體遵照政府平抑物價主旨，毋得稍違，以期協渡難關云。</p>
<h3>鴻祥錢莊復業</h3>
<p>鴻祥錢莊這戰前上海匯劃錢莊之一，現經財部核准，定一月六日復業，總經理馮作舟，係金融界前輩馮受之先生之哲嗣，學識經騐，均極豐當，經理羅文吉，副經理吳渭濱，襄理秦秋如，均這金融界知名之士。</p>
<h3>僑匯逃避　數額驚人</h3>
<p>月達一千萬美元</p>
<p>關係國際收支平衡之僑匯一項，近數月來均在遞減中，截至最近，僑匯逃避之風益見猖獗，據有關方面調查所得，香港廣州間逃避之僑匯，每月達一千萬美金，誠這一驚人之數字，據中國銀行報吿，以前每月僑匯收入的這五百萬美金，現僅二百萬左右，相差達五分之三，其逃避之原因，不外受外匯問題之影響，政府所訂外匯掛牌這三三五〇，而黑市高達六千，牌價過低，黑市過高，此實這僑匯逃避最大之因素，至其逃避方法，則寄託於美金匯票及港幣兩種，第一種美金匯票原這美國甲鎭匯至乙鎭使用者，商人購進後，可寄往美國作結付貨價之用，第二種港幣匯票則可在香港收取現鈔，現中國銀行正與中央銀行積極籌商，挽救僑匯逃避之對策，貝總裁此次赴港，聞對此一問題亦有關云。</p>

<p>茲據製藥業負責人稱：（一）該業之貸款目前正在個別聲請中，惟因其限制頗嚴，手續又繁，且甚多行莊均不願承轉，故截至目前這止，已申請者祗十二家，申請貸款之數目亦祗五十億左右，惟迄今尙無一家核准，然整個製藥業雖已安渡陽歷年關，如政府再不加以急速救濟，在陰歷年關內至少當有半數以上之會員將倒閉或擱淺，故製藥業之前途仍未可樂觀。（二）過去該會曾向衛生局，物資供應局及輸入管委會等提出搭售國製西藥，及限制與禁止外貨進口等要求，迄今仍未獲批覆，該業除嚴　本身，加緊改造出品，以求自力更生外，對以上各局會所提要求被擱置不理。甚表遺憾。</p>
<h3>日商獲准對外通信　國外貿易開始復員</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京三日電〕盟軍最高統帥部貿易專家畢凱爾談稱：在日本新公布之郵政條例下，日本進出口商可能開始奠定恢復平時貿易之基礎，但仍不能直接以貨物出售或訂立運貨合同，因日本對外貿易仍採取政府與政府問直接交易之立塲。自戰時郵政條例寬放限制後，日商得與外商互通商業函件，但此類函信須受檢查，其內容以下列數點這限：（一）可供出口商品之尺寸，式樣及顏色，（二）關於戰前出口貨及新出品銷路之詢問，（三）製造品可供出口之大概數量。今後日商可藉通信方法，開闢國外市塲，但須向日本貿易局申請輸出許可，經盟軍最高統帥部核准後，貿易局即以日金向該商人收購所需出口之商品，然後照例辦理政府與政府間之出口手續。畢氏謂；日圓與各國貨幣之匯率尙禾規定，故日商與外商不應商議貨價。關於轍入品之通信，雖在許可之列，但目前無甚裨益，因可資利用之資金僅限於輸入日本所最需要之原料，且關於原料之輸入，將由盟軍統帥部直接與外國商業機關接洽辦理。雖然，日商與外商恢複通訊，實這日本國外貿易回復至民營貿易　礎之重要步驟，並可擴大未來之貿易範圍云。</p>

<h3>成本過高　出口貨寥落</h3>
<p>記者頃據出口商人談稱：自進出口貿易賞施合理管制後，我國現行外匯率，大致暫時不致變更，進口商人雖蒙其惠，惟經營出口貿易者，則深感苦悶，蓋戰後各國，對於我國各類出口貨物，始猪　生絲茶葉桐油綢緞刺繡瓷器皮毛地毯等等，均極感需要，國外函電問訊踴躍，但出口商多以血本翮係，開價過高，而未能成交，致大好之國際市塲未能爭取，殊這可惜，問題癥結，厥在出口商售出貨款所得之匯票，須按照官價，結售於中央銀行，此中損失，願這巨大，若出口匯黑能准許自由結售於進口商人，或其他需要者，則我國產品在國外市塲或可與其他各國爭一日之短長云。</p>

<h3>東北經濟動態（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員　韓淸濤</p>
<p>在「倒風」猛襲京滬各地的時候，東北也正面對着經濟危機，三十六年的開頭，危機開始嚴重化，大家旣然認這東北是中國生命綫，那慶要怎樣的去挽救東北的經濟危機，來救東北，來救自己，第一個課題，是需要首先明瞭東北經濟現况。</p>
<p>東北目前難題，是經重工業，候能恢復，是經濟瀕於格竭，所仰仗的唯一農產品大豆，高樑，又因運輸困難，沒有出路，以致事事沒有辦法。　瀋陽和平日報社，最近舉辦了一次「貿易問題座談會，」從參加的一些經濟專家們的口裏，可以知道一些梗概。</p>
<p>工礦危機</p>
<p>費委會東北辦事處處長兼撫順煤礦礦長謝樹英說：東北工礦，目前，面臨着一個危機，到今年三四月間，將是最嚴重的一個階段，假使再不謀求合理的解決，即將陷於不堪設想的境地。</p>
<p>以撫順煤來購，器材的缺乏，技術人員的不足，都是最嚴重的問題，現在許多礦裏積水過多，抽水機大感缺乏，其他附件在接收的時候，也十九是殘破得不堪使用，當然影響生產。其餘如運輸皮帶、木材，支柱等煤礦必需器材，也缺乏得可憐，假使到今年三四月不能補足，礦內積水不能抽去，就勢將被淹滅。</p>
<p>東北礦產出口，原不是困難的事，電力和煤是一切輕重工業的原動力，只要電力與煤不成問題，其他鋼鐵等重工業駭造紙化學等經工業，便都可以漸漸繁榮，繁榮以後，出口貿易的發展，是可以想像到的。</p>
<p>同時，關內外的物貨交流，也可以順利推動，關內運進大量的器材及日用品，關外則可以運出煤和鋼鐵，在合理條件下，以今年估計，煤可運出五百萬噸的數量。總之，一切都應當統籌辦理，使之達到合理化。</p>
<p>乙鋼鐵說：美國鋼鐵現在已經到上海，目前的價格，反較我們關內的便宜，我們還談甚麼貿易？今年政府如果不下最大決心，制訂一種政策，使東北工礦復興，那就只有失敗。所以當局除了大量投資補充器材以外、還應解決出產的運銷問題，這對於東北對外貿易，也是具有決定性的。</p>
<p>總之，今年一年，可以說是東北工礦整理的一個階級，對外貿易的能否推展，也得奠定在這一年裏。</p>
<p>穀賤傷農</p>
<p>遼寗省商聯會理事長號瀋陽市商會會長金恩祺說：最近糧價普遍低落，「穀賤傷農」，殊非好現象。比如最近就有不少小集體農產分担的農民，紛紛要向地主交地，因這去年收穫，不能維特到今年播種。大豆，棉花，高梁行市太低，農村無購買力，非得大宗貿易有辦法不能解決，否則即小宗貨日用品生產，也無法發展。目前煤價高而運銷不暢，糧價低，有很多人就以大豆作燃料，說來尤覺可惜。</p>
<p>東北行轅經濟委員會商務處副處長王念祖表示：談到大豆，就談到大豆出口的問題，王先生說：「大豆出口，在日本控制東北時不及二百萬噸，高梁也不過一百多萬噸，其次則這雜糧，關於糧食方面，在從前日本人控制東北時，配合金融政策收賈食種，放出去的錢，總在外面流動三分之一。</p>
<p>如今，因技術人員的困難，冒險性太大，大批食糧沒有人收買的時侯，只可由政府收買，俾靑黃不接時候拋出去。經委會已計劃辦理大宗收購，烯望今年大豆能出口五十萬噸左右，大豆出口運到關內，目前約有一萬噸，運往關外則較少，最近則準備運出兩萬噸。　目前車輛調度尙無辦法，事實是因這車輛少，軍運多，並且經共軍破壞後的鐵路，原來的雙軌大多改這單軌，所以在目前運輸的確是一個難題。</p>
<p>豆的悲哀</p>
<p>東北行轅經委會商務處副處長章友江表示，就現實講，東北主要出產品是大豆，據調查：遼寗，吉林，安東，遼北四省大豆產量，民國卅一年市上賣出量是二九萬二四二五公噸，本年度四省收復區的產量，是八百零三萬四千公噸，研究結果，假定四省收復區人口這兩千萬（實際要多）每人每年要豆油四斤，大豆五十斤，則總數要五十萬公噸，是則大豆能出口量這二十萬公噸，加上現存的十五萬公噸，最多目能能出口量是四十五公噸。</p>
<p>如果全部出口，按現在市塲的價格每斤十元計算即可有九十億流通券流進來，所以說，促進大豆出口是今日最要緊的一件急務，這與東北經濟繁榮有很大的關係。</p>
<p>事實上，大豆出口並不是困難的事，而困難在四十五萬公噸大豆不易運出，因這一方面現在的價格會阻碍出產，另一方面是交通運輸的困難，同時東北本來出超，所以多少應有些顧慮，但不管關內外貿易出超與吾，拿現在情形看，此筆進款總可以帮助東北工農各項建設，所以說東北貿易發展這東北建設的橋樑。</p>
<p>日本人建設東北，多是東北本身的錢，這有數目字可考，其中百分之六七十分建設資金，是靠了東北出口貿易，平均百分之八十以上，靠東北內部資金，所以東北出口貿易本身是偉大的，基礎也非常鞏固。</p>
<p>扶持貿易</p>
<p>資源委員會東北辦事處副處長曹立瀛說：目前東北經濟，如「半死之馬」，處於半生不死的情况，東北貿易事業，只要出口數字够，貿易自然可以正常發展。日本在東北實施貿易統制政策，每年總是出超，在其構成成分中，工礦的比例數較農產有逐年增高的趨勢，所以在日本人統制時代，工礦成分愈來愈高，現在農產品生產數量大，工礦產品的數量則微乎其微，所以我們應就出口優先程序考慮一下。（未完）</p>
<h3>世界棉布恐慌現勢</h3>
<p>— 韻譯</p>
<p>世界上雖有許多國家棉花過賸　棉布織造仍為當前切要的問題</p>
<p>今年雖然已經過去，但是世界上棉布衣着的恐慌，在許多國家之內依舊要從今年帶到明年。從全世界的情形通盤看來，這種缺乏並無終止跡象可尋。</p>
<p>當然情形將來總是要改善的。不過無論現在美國以及其他幾個國家裏的棉花發生過賸，但襯衫，便服，工裝以及長袍的供應，一仍將繼續稀少。棉織品的增產實這當前最切要的問題。</p>
<p>世界各國的棉紡織業如今均在增產之中，但是由於人工和煤斤的缺乏，機器的稀少，以及其他種種肇因於戰爭的經濟脫節，生產力的全部復員始終遲遲不易達到。</p>
<p>日本的棉織品出口數量在戰前佔世界總額百分之四十。盟國間在對於該國紡織工業的處置辦法上久久不能獲得協議，實這造成世界棉布恐慌的因素之一，目前德日兩國境內的復員努力雖然已受種種爭執的躭誤甚大，尙在繼續不斷進行之中，以謀恢復紡織業的生產，供應歐亞兩洲甫經解放的國家。不過截至一九四六年十一月這止，兩國均未能有產品出口。</p>
<p>缺乏情形</p>
<p>世界各地棉織品缺乏的程度各不相同。在英國，配給制度仍舊嚴格執行，普通每一個英國人只能買到他在戰前所購量的半數。法國缺乏的情形要比英國厲害不少。至於歐洲其他的國家，則已缺乏到主婦們甚至把被單，窗簾，檯布之類都剪裁成衣服以替換她們破敗不堪的舊裝的程度了。</p>
<p>拉丁美洲諸國情形比較地好，這些國家的棉織品進口量且已較戰前增加百分之五十。美國棉織品的消費量亦已回復戰前水準。由於全民就業，收入增加，和軍人複員等等因素之刺激，美國棉織品的消費量至少亦已較戰前增多百之五十。</p>
<p>受到衣着恐慌壓迫最烈的是東南亞洲的一萬萬七千萬人民。他們所能得到的棉布僅及需要量的四分之一。因此除非以衣着這酬，他們甚至拒絕作工。對於西方國家工業復員極端有關的橡皮，錫，椰乾，食糖，苧蔴及油類等原料的生產乃間接受到影響。中國及印度飢荒區域所急需的米量生產亦已因而减少。</p>
<p>縱觀世界現勢，除去美國和前軸心國家不論，各國所能獲得的棉織品數量，平均僅及戰前四分之三而已。</p>
<p>增產計劃</p>
<p>已有棉布生產的國家正擬經由在戰時合組的紡建委員會將現有的產品平均分配到世界上感到缺乏的地區去。本年上半年世界各國棉織品出口總量約這十萬萬碼，與戰前水準相較幾少三分之一。其中今日世界上出口量最大的美國計佔四萬萬碼，的這該國生產總額的四分之一。</p>
<p>英國輸出了二萬萬五千萬碼，在其出口貨總額中佔百分之三十，其他的棉織品輸出國有印度，巴西，墨西哥及加拿大等。</p>
<p>現時法國，意大利，荷蘭，比利時等國的棉織品對外輸出均在開始之中，美國有些官員相信，以上各國的出品，再加上由美國供給棉花交給德日製造的產品，在一九四七年的上半年對於急需棉布各國的供應總量可達二十萬萬碼之多。</p>
<p>困難重重</p>
<p>不過橫在這二十萬萬碼棉布增產計劃前面的障礙，是非常地大的。　預計其能够供給五萬萬碼布疋的日本（此數約當該國戰前棉布的口額百分之四十），國內棉紡織業的復員尙在開始。一九四六年八月的出口量僅這一千七百萬碼，食物和煤斤的缺乏很可能使其輸出額減至比我們所期望的一半還少。</p>
<p>歐洲的棉紡織業也面對着極嚴重的人工和煤斤缺乏，增產因之亦必十分困難。</p>
<p>並且歐洲各國以及美國作爲政治壓力的施行，即使棉布增產果能如預定計劃，亦必把握大宗棉織品用作國內消費。美國的物價管制如果一旦廢止，她的出口量必將大減，國際紡建委員會且將因此頻於破產的地步，在這種情形之下，國際間的貿易競爭一定會取基於需要情形而定的分配原則而代之　在自由貿易的原則之下，現在穿蕭已經頂漂亮的國家如美國及拉了美洲諸國實處於最有利的地位，因這她們有的是錢。那時候歐洲和亞洲自敵人手裏解放出來的國家所能獲得的棉織品將要比現在更少。</p>
<p>未來瞻望</p>
<p>根據上述情形目前一種趨勢已經至這明顯：假使國際間的分配制度明年果眞廢止，則在少數國家內棉織品的供應情形確將轉好，但是對於棉織品需要最殷切的地區的情形反將更形不堪設想。</p>
<p>反之，如果計劃中的世界各國棉織品總額二十萬萬碼能够如期達到，同時並能將分配制度加以維持，則世界上感到衣着恐慌的國家所需棉布總量二十二萬五千萬碼，在一九四七年下半年即可得到充分供應。</p>
<p>不過即使達到這種情形，距離棉織品恐慌的全部過去依舊很遠。必須將各產棉國家棉織品的輸出總額提至每半年三十二萬五千萬碼，方可與戰前的水準相比。而這幾年以來，世界各國的需要量當然又已大大地增加了。</p>
<p>我們的結論是除非有一個嚴重的不是氣襲來使人們的購買力十分减低，在未來的一段長時期內，世界有些地區堆擱棉布的架子將依舊空空如也。（原文載十一月五日報吿週刋）</p>

<h3>旅大外圍圈</h3>
<p>— 本報瀋陽元旦航訊　本報東北特派員韓清清</p>
<p>在政府接收旅大的前夕，在全世界報章大登旅大消息的時候，引起了國人的莫大的注意和興趣；因為國軍現在僅僅活動在大連的邊緣線上，同時過去旅大整個的發展，又關連着所謂「關東州」地帶，今天，實有把敵偽「關東州」政治·經濟和建設的情形，介紹給大家的必要，這也就是旅大的核心和外圍的實際輪廓。</p>
<p>這塊地區，是遠東半島的觸角，站在全島南端的尖角上，黃海在東，渤海在西，觸角伸在了中心，它的範圍，包括從普蘭店北方朝陽寺附近，到貔子窩東方碧流河地方，劃成了一個線，所有以南地域和附近的島嶼，都歸屬了它，而積計有三千四百六十二平方啓程又四四五，形成了敵人的吐納口，生命線。</p>
<p>這塊特殊區域裏，丘陵起伏，缺少平地，河川流域狹小，沒有水運的便利，黃海沿岸，海岸線彎曲較多，像大連·旅順·都是天然的良港，沿岸的闊平砂灘，又都適宜於曬鹽，主要的島嶼有五島和長山列島。</p>
<p>氣候一班</p>
<p>觸角地區，因為地勢關係，是被海洋氣候支配着，同時因為接近大陸，也受了大陸氣候的影響，冬季從十一月起到翌年四月止，約有半年的長時間，夏季也較長，常有由冬一變而成了夏天的傾向。</p>
<p>近了五月，就感覺有了暑氣，從七月到八月中旬，到達了極點，但，朝晚的氣溫減低，通常不感有暑熱的苦楚，九月中旬，氣溫下降，秋光充滿天地，到了十一月，一切都呈冬季景象，是圍爐生活的時期了。</p>
<p>七·八兩月可以算做雨季，雨量竟達全年的半數，但，極少驟雨大風，晴天日數多，日照數也多，降雪和積雪的日子卻很少，此外在春季有大陸旋風，把砂塵捲舞天空，形成了黃砂現象，太陽光黯淡下去，是令人不愉快的時期！</p>
<p>行政制度</p>
<p>過去，「關東州」的行政組織，有「關東局」和「關東州廳」，局設日駐偽滿大使館，應設大連市，關東局長為駐偽滿全權大使，受日本大東亞大臣的監督，辦理關東局事務，「關東州廳」長官，受日本大使的指揮，管理關東州的行政事務，依照職權或特別的委任，有對陸海軍司令官發佈命令，請求使用兵力的權限。</p>
<p>「關東州」的地方自治制度，分「市制」和「會制」兩種，州內行政區，分做二市，六十四會，除了在大連，旅順兩街市地方，施行市制外，其他都施行會制，計分金州，普蘭店，貔子窩，旅順四區，在各區置有民政署，所屬會數是按民政署範圍，各有不同，計旅順十，金州十六，普蘭店十八，貔子窩二十。</p>
<p>旅大海運</p>
<p>旅大的海運史，雖為日尚淺，但州內日本船隊的發展，實足驚人，旅大的對外交通，是以一九〇六年大連港改為自由貿易港時為轉機，因大連港，以旅順為輔助港的關係，吞吐偽滿特產貿易貨物，同時「滿鐵」經營碼頭得法，不僅和日本內地，臺灣，中國沿岸，南洋通航，遠至澳洲，印度，歐洲，北美也互相連絡，偽滿成立後，為了資源開發，各川產業勃興，船舶往來頻繁，達到了極點，但，後來受英·法·德各國船舶影響頗大，一九一五年，滿鐵別動隊的「大連汽船會社」成立後，形成日本第三位的大船隊，加上「關東州」其他船舶的增加，得在東亞海運界個別有重要地位。</p>
<p>在九·一八事變和太平洋戰爭時期，外國商業公司逐漸撤退，日本商業會社，集中合併，收荘休行的也頗多，最後大連僅剩的商業會社，僅有大汽，東亞，油船，山下，三井諸社，此外，還有滿洲海運會社。</p>
<p>蘇軍到達了旅大的外圍和核心，大連灣內，日本船少了，除了蘇聯少數的船隻。和共軍使用的一些木船外，很少有其他船舶來往了。</p>
<p>工商近景</p>
<p>過去，旅大和外圍的商業，受着極大的統制，人民日用物品，完全由日滿商業會社，纖維會社，青果會社，水產會社，分別担任，此外，在偽滿和關東州貿易聯合會下，設三十九實業組合担任配給。</p>
<p>日人為了協助政府所推行的經濟政策，除了商工部門外，更包含農業，水產，在大連，旅順，金州，各地，設立各團體聯合的「關東州經濟會」，擁有會員二千四百餘人。</p>
<p>目前，所有的商業組織，變質了，有的由着蘇聯經營一切，有的在共軍手　裏，從事於畸形商業的經營。</p>
<p>工業，在經濟界佔有重要地位，這個地區工業的發展，是由於「滿鐵」成立沙河口工廠，或隨着成立的若干包做零件工廠，而形成發展狀況，其中重要的工廠，有大連船塢，大連機械，滿化，滿曹，滿石，和最後成立的滿州重機，三蒙，馬克尼等，到了一九四一年度，平時有職工五人以上的工廠，大連有一千零四十三廠，旅順一百二十二廠，金州一百四十七廠，普蘭店三十八廠，貔子窩二十二廠，合計一千三百七十二廠，投資額為五億五千八百八十餘萬元滿幣，生產額為四億九千餘萬元。</p>
<p>一九四二年五月，成立了一個「關東州工業會」，該會的主要任務，為對同業的調查，研究，對入會會員的工廠配給物質，並担任培養自給農塲的技術人員，以投資額在五十萬元以上，或經工會所承認的「組合」為會員，計有紡織工業，金屬機械工業，化學工業，油脂工業，窰業，食料品工業，電氣瓦斯等。</p>
<p>漁鹽利潤</p>
<p>水產業，也是重要產業之一，同時「關東州」又為東北唯一的水產，因為遠東半島兩面的黃海和渤海所產，　，鯖，平鯽，鲹，　，黃花魚，鯛魚，刀魚，鱸，蝦等主要魚類，最為豐富。</p>
<p>一九二六年成立「關東州水產會」，以改良發展水產業為目的關東州廳內設事務所，並在大連，旅順，金州，普蘭店，貔子窩各設支部，會員有日人三百八十人，華人五千二百五十人，該會的主要事業，為在大連，旅順開設魚市塲，並從事水產物銷路調查，或漁業保護管理等工作，一九三九年，改　關東州水產振興會社代辦。</p>
<p>老虎灘，設有水產試騐塲，所辦業務，計有關於水產的試騐或調查以及關於水產的分析或鑑定等，此外還有一個水產講習所，是以養成水產業幹部為中心任務</p>
<p>這個區域裏雨量少，蒸發旺盛，大氣乾燥，最高適於曬鹽，從前和臺灣，青島等處，都為著名的鹽產地，在日人開始統制的時候，華人僅有少數鹽田，其餘皆為日人經營，鹽田的所在地，計有貔子窩，登沙河，普蘭店，金州，夾心子，石河，旅順等地，鹽產大部輸運日本內地和朝鮮。貔各地產鹽用途，計分化學工業用鹽，洗滌和食用鹽等，近來可用　水製造航空用鋁，的以　水工業，大有發展希望，日人遂在普蘭店設「關東州　水化學工廠」，夾心子「關東州加里工業工廠，」都產固形　水很多，大部供給朝鮮化學工業需用。</p>
<p>一九三三年，大房身，成立關東廳鹽業試騐塲，並在旅順設立分廠，後因滷水工業發展，又設立試騐工廠，辦理製鹽試騐調查，製鹽研究分析，滷水的利用試騐和研究等事。</p>
<p>農田礦產</p>
<p>旅大核心和外圍所產食糧，不足現地需用，每年須用遼南和遼北供給甚多，所產榖類，玉蜀黍為主，落花生，高粱，栗，次之，蔬菜類，以白菜，蘿蔔，瓜類最多。</p>
<p>這個地區裏氣候，風土，最適宜栽培果樹，在早產梨，杏，山楂等，一九〇六年後，開始栽培蘋菓，葡萄，或櫻桃，成是極佳，其中尤以蘋菓最著名，現在菓樹耕作面積極廣。</p>
<p>金州東門外，設有農事試騐塲，內分種藝·菓樹·蔬菜·農藝·化學·昆蟲·蠶業等部門，為了對於重要輸出農產物精良起見，特設輸出農產物檢查所，對於輸出信譽收獲很大。</p>
<p>旅大外圍，雖無大規模礦產，但礦業甚為發達，目前開採約有苦灰石·石綿·金·鐵·煤·重晶石·螢石·錳·金鋼紗·梵士礦等十種礦產。</p>
<p>苦灰石，礦量豐富，品質優良，礦產除大部輸往日本內地外，所餘都消費在鞍山製鐵所，和大連的山元微粉漁料工廠，苦灰石的用途，大都充製鐵高熱爐的耐火材料，玻璃配合　，一般土木建築的高級塗料。</p>
<p>石綿產在金州和尚山，重晶石和螢石，產在普蘭店，其他礦產分佈在各地。</p>
<p>「關東州」，過去，是特殊化的地區，有美麗，有醜惡，一方面是開化，是文明，一方面是壓制同，是野蠻，日人有過很好的，同胞受過殘酷的待遇，單拿日人警察講，同胞們好像老鼠見了貓，今天，「關東州」的名詞不存在了，魔影消滅了，整塊的地方，恢復了中華的版圖，只看我們如何利用它，如何開發它！</p>
<h3>臺灣橡膠工廠</h3>
<p>— 十九日臺北航訊　本報駐臺記者楊育</p>
<p>關係於國防民生至深且巨的橡膠工業，在臺灣因為橡樹的不宜栽植，所以除掉有些零星的小規模製造廠外，就沒有一個統盤籌設的大工廠，直到第二次大戰後，日本受到了海路交通斷絕的威脅，感到橡膠工業不能急起直追的危險，於是就將臺省的許多小型製造廠，在民國三十年間合併成一元化的「臺灣　　株式會社」，在臺北市郊外松山南港之間大興土木，充實設備，擴大規模，實行壟斷政策，來供應戰時軍用的鞋類，自行車胎，飛機輪等，同時這個會社還具有製造各種農工礦業機器配備上所有附件的高度性能，至戰爭末期，這裏又建設瞭製造汽車卡車輪胎的工塲，一切機器多已裝配就緒，可是原子炸彈終於迫使侵略者放棄了像這樣的許多使他們不忍放手的大工厰。</p>
<p>渡過難關　生產逾三百萬</p>
<p>民國卅五年四月十七日，臺省工礦處正式接收了這個會社，改為「臺灣橡膠工廠」，隸屬於化學製品公司。據沈廠長雲階告訴記者，在當時從日本人手中拿過來的流動資金，雖有臺幣七十餘萬元，庫存製成品及半成品等折價亦有臺幣近九百五十萬元，其餘的就是房屋土地機器等估價約臺幣二千萬元，可是最感困難的卻是廠裏的原料因為當初海洋的被封鎖，舊有的存儲品為數極少，同時許多機器亦為了避免盟機轟炸，四處疏散，廠旁破舊，門窗不全。但已經變成了我們自己的東西，在光復建設的大道上，是不能讓它有一刻停頓的！經過在上者的督率，在下的同心協力，居然渡過了這個難關，埋頭苦幹了幾個月，在九·十·十一的三個月中，因為整理關係，所以生產數字略有降低，但一到十二月，僅僅上半個月的生產數字，已逾三百萬元，預計全月當在七百萬元以上。</p>
<p>鞋靴之類　製造速度驚人</p>
<p>記者由該廠技術課的謝啓元先生，領導了把工廠的幾個部份參觀了一下：滾筒工廠是壓製初步配料物及再生膠產品的。整塊的橡膠，和許多必須配合的硫黃，軟化劑，填充劑，防止老化劑等，一起倒在兩個光滑的大滾筒中間，像做麵食那樣揉搓着，漸漸地變軟，和藥物混成了一塊黑色的皮張一般，這樣需要半小時許的時間才算初步完成了生橡膠，待要用的時候再拿出來經過壓平機壓成厚薄的膠張和許多應用的花紋，製造再生膠是廢物利用的工作，把破爛的已經經過了「加硫」以後的橡膠，在機器中磨成了粉末，再加軟化劑通以高熱，就可以取出摻雜在生橡膠中。這部份的機器設備，有滾筒機七具，碾碎滾筒一具，磨碎機一具，壓光機五具，鼓形乾燥器一具，加硫器二具，膠糊混和器六具，截斷機七具，壓速機六具，現在多全部在開工應用。</p>
<p>第一工塲是製造男女長短雨靴，運動鞋，地下足袋（日本式兩個足趾分開的鞋子）等各式鞋類的工塲，二百五十一輛的縫紉機連續把截斷機上取下的布面踏成了一鞋鞋垢鞋樣，由女工塗膠配底。雨靴因為全部是橡膠的關係，手續比較繁瑣，可是平均十五分鐘也就可以黏成一雙。生鋁的鞋模，地下足九七八雙，運動鞋三八三五雙，全膠短鞋一八九二雙，長靴三八九雙，前圓足下三五三八雙，雨靴二〇〇〇雙，但樣子非常舊，現在除掉已經新製許多女式斗長靴的模型外，明年還要繼續改良添置。</p>
<p>製成品多要經過加硫（就是加熱）的手續，用木架子裝好送進一架加硫器裏用高熱的蒸氣加以噴　使橡膠與硫黃發生了化學作用，變得可以經久耐用。這種直接加硫容易使有色布褪色，一架間接加硫器不久就要應用了。</p>
<p>橡皮水管　可以大量供應</p>
<p>第二工塲專門製造人力車自行車胎與水管。這裏的機器設備完全是適用於管狀製作的，在戰爭期間，日本人為避免轟炸的損失，曾強迫民間購買消防水管，現在平均每家多有四十呎橡皮管子，所以這裏上下雖有日產二千呎的能力，但銷路卻反顯得呆滯了。他們都望接受外省的定貨，以營業的資金收入現地來擴充範圍。</p>
<p>製造汽車，卡車輪胎的第三工塲，設備雖全，但是現在因為缺少外胎裏面的厚布Cord，始終未能開工。</p>
<p>明年度橡膠工廠已擬具計劃，每月產鞋額七千雙，皮管類三三七六五呎，滾筒類一五八八呎，輪帶類五二〇條，衝墊類一三〇〇〇尺，汽車胎類六〇〇只，自行車胎類五六〇〇只，總値可達臺幣一千萬元以上。日本人經營時代的生產數字現在還沒有查出，但據沈廠長說因為原料可以至南洋去採辦，再加將來銷路推廣，所以明年度預計的生產額至少可以超過過去。</p>

<h3>論地方國度</h3>
<p>— 阮毅成</p>
<p>在這次國民大會中，國民政府提出的憲法草案第十一章，原名為省縣制度，經第六審查委員會決定改為地方制度。這一章可以說是此次憲章較之五五憲章最進步的一章；因為與前面的一章第十章相連接，便確定了地方均權的運用。我們知道這次的憲章，關於國家組織方面，有兩個基本精神，便是中央分權與地方均權，這都是國父的遺教。但是過去往往有人將中央的分權看成為一權，由總統一人行使治權；又把地方均權看成了集權，一切由中央主擋土持。地方制度之得於憲法中確定其地位，有關於建國的前途，實深重大。</p>
<p>訓政以來，對於地方自治的工作，始終沒有完成。在抗戰期間，國民政府於二十九年公布了縣各級組織綱要，簡稱新縣制，融保甲與自治為一體，使事業與組織相並重，本可以成為推行地方自治的一個好機會。但是：（一）新縣制始終未經過立法程序，而縣自治法亦始終未經立法院制定。（二）中央將國家行政事項如徵兵徵糧等，責成地方自治團體辦理，並責地方負担其經費（三）地方自治的各種事業在中央與省均分屬於若干不相統屬的機關主管，以致法令不統一，計劃不連貫，主觀的輕重有別，考核的標準不同。（四）幹部訓練的課程，繁言不要；尤其與正常的教育制度未能配合。因之新縣制雖則規定應於三年內完成，但所完成的只是組織的一部份，而事業還差得很遠。尤其自抗戰以後，力量要集中於中央，省縣的地位日趨降落，以致省縣財政直遭破產，公教人員的待遇無法提高，事業經費沒有着落，極小的事都要聽候中央命令辦理或者須請示中央因以造成中央在力求小同的形式方面着手，而地方反變成清凈無可作為的局面。所以在今日要責備地方為什麼沒有完成自治？實在使負地方責任以及民眾難以置答。</p>
<p>曰地方制度就是要建立一個有系統的地方自治制度。在新憲法中，我們可以看得出來：</p>
<p>（甲）地方自治制度的法律系統是由上而下的。憲法承認的自治地位，由憲法上明文規定了省縣自治通則由中央立法并執行或交由省縣執行。省縣自治通則對憲法講是子法，但對省縣自治法講，則為母法。通由旣由中央立法，則日後各省縣的自治法均不能有所違背。換言之，內容仍可以大致相同。許多不放心地方自行制定自治法的人，可以放心各省縣的自治制度，不會相差太遠的。憲法規定省民代表會依據省縣自治通則制定省自治法。所以從自治的法律系統上講，仍是由上而下的，不會變成聯邦國家的狀態。</p>
<p>（乙）省縣自治法的內容仍保有很多的彈性。憲法上只規定了應當有省縣自治通則，并沒有詳舉其內容，省自治法的內容，憲法上只規定了主要三項，縣自治法也沒有定明內容。都是留給地方立法時的彈性。所以我們希望中央在日後制定省縣自治通則時不宜過於繁瑣，使得省縣自治法無法因地制宜。而省與縣的關係，省縣政府的組織，縣以下的自治組織與事業，在憲法中所以不加列舉，目的即在保留給省縣自治法以較多的彈性。不會像現在一樣，連極細致的事情，都要中央偏勞。</p>
<p>（丙）省縣均有代表會，也均有立法權。憲法規定省縣民代表會制定省縣自治法。這是因為在新的省縣議會未產生前，應當先有造法機關，制定省縣自治法。省縣民代表會并不如國民大會一樣，而可能不是常設的機關。日後省縣長的選舉罷免，省縣自治法的修改，是否仍需要召集省縣民代表會辦理，或即由省縣議會辦理，或交由省縣公民直接行使四權，都可以由各省縣自行在該省縣自治法中規定，不必強求各省縣一律。譬如今日在新疆已經實行縣長民選，但也偗縣尚未能辦到，就可以了解不必一律，方能國地因時制宜。憲法又規定省縣議會行使省縣立法權，這一點也很重要。因為國父主張的均權，是均治權，均事務。治權當中的司法監察考試，應當統屬於中央，具有全國一致的性質。而行政與立法則當由中央與省縣均之。否則均權制度的精神便不能貫澈。所以省縣民代表會所行使的是創制省縣自治法的政權，而省縣議會所行使的是屬於治權的地方立法權，兩者都屬必要。</p>
<p>（丁）憲法除規定了中央立法並執行，中央立法交省縣執行的事項之外，還規定了省立法並執行及縣立法並執行的事項，這就是三級均權制。將中央與省縣的事權都加以列舉，才真正合於均權的原則。而將未列舉事項的剩餘權，俟日後視其性質，分別屬諸中央或省或縣，遇有爭議，則交由人民普選產生的中央立法院予以解決，如此才將國父的均權制度充分表現。因為地方自治的內容不在法律上空洞的規定其為自治單位，而在確定其自治事務的項目。項目確定了，才可以免除中央省縣互相爭權或互相推諉的情事，而某項事務由中央或省或縣辦理，即由中央或省或縣負担其經費，更可以免除中央與省縣爭利或彼此權義不相平均之弊。多年以來，每有人主張減縮省的事權，以為減縮了省的事權就是提高了縣的事權。其實不然，以我國縣數之多，各縣人口面積文化富源相差之遠，而且多數縣份在日前都不能自給自足省的事權減縮了之後，縣不能負荷其事務，結果反而要中央代勞，無形中反提高了中央的職責與權力。所謂於省有損，於縣無益。這是提倡地方自治的人所不願意的，卻也是不及料的。</p>
<p>憲政的基礎在自治，民主的根源在地方。從今憲法上有了合乎遺教合於國情的地方制度，盼望全國各地方都能善用這良好的地方制度，為建國的前途奠定最堅固的礎石。</p>
<h3>集會結社自由</h3>
<p>— 慧生</p>
<p>中華民國憲法第二章第十四條載：人民有集體及結社之自由，這項規定，似乎極其普通，並沒有甚麼問題，其實現在問題卻多得很。</p>
<p>所以發生問題，並不是說，受到某種限制，以至不能享受自由，相反地，乃在某一部份人民享受自由，倒使另一部份人民失去了自由。</p>
<p>律師·會計師，非加入各該地公會為會員，不能行使職務，這是人人所知道的。現行的同業公會法和工會法，也都強迫入會制。例如工會法第三章第十二條，規定：凡在工會組織區域內年滿十六歲之男女工人，均應加入其所從事之同一產業或職業之工會為會員。又商業同業公會法第三章第十二條規定，同一區域內之商業同業公司行號，不論公營或民營，除關防之公營事業，或法令規定之國家專營業外，均應為商業同業公會會員，同法第八章第四十二條，並規定：公司行號，不依本法加入商業同業公會，……得按其情節輕重，……為左列之處分，一·違約金，二·有期間之停業，三·永久停業。工業同業公會法，也有類似的規定。就是說：這些公司行號工廠，非加入公會為會員不可。也就是說：這些公司行號工廠，皆有加入公會之義務，已不到加入與否的自由。倘使確認其具有自由，那麼，加入固可，不加入似乎也未嘗不可。</p>
<p>因為現行法，在積極方面，旣規定均應加入，在消費方面，又規定種種制裁，所以人民對集會結社，好像是一種義務，不是權利，自由這兩個字，顧名思議，便有點格格不入。而且在事實上，也早已發生了狠多的糾紛。因為自有一部份工商分子，情願放棄權利，不願意享受這種強迫的自由，以至辦理會務的人，不得不採取種種行動來強求其加入。或多方勸誘，督令加入，或派遣多人，形同要脅，甚至請求官廳，用命令來強迫他們入會。而此等不願入會的自由分子，則用種種方法來規避搪塞，務求倖免。因此造成了許多集會結社的糾葛。耳目所及，並有一部份公會，要求外商也一律入會。但照外僑組織商會及參加商業團體辦法第二條，在同一縣市政府之城鎮，同籍外商……不滿五家時，得分別加入所在地各該業同業公會為會員，則加入與否，似乎也不無自由餘地。因為得字的意義，究與「必須」「均應」不同。這些糾紛應該如何解決，非本文的範圍，這裏所要研究的是，人民有了集會結社之自由，到底還有沒有不集會，不結社之自由，再引申一下，如果因為現行法規定無此自由，那麼，這些現行法，是否與憲法的精神抵觸？</p>
<p>有人以為憲法第廿三條載明：以上各條列之自由權利，除為防止妨礙他人自由……不得以法律限制之，照此規定，用法律來限制自由，並不算違憲。不知本條文的意義，是在某種塲合下，可以用法律來限制人民集會結社等等自由，就是說：應該可以集會結社的時候，不許他們集會結社，並不是不要集會結社的時候，硬要他們集結。假如憲法規定的自由，必須強令人民享受，那麼，這種自由，已經是義務，不是自由，也不是權利。這項條文，就應當改為「人民有依法律集會結社之義務，」和納稅，服兵役同樣看待，或照國民教育例，改為「人民有集會結社之權利與義務，」方才可通。而且憲法規定的人民自由，除掉集會結社之外，還有居住，遷徙，言論，講學，著作，出版，秘密通訊，信仰宗教等待，假如集會結社，可以用法律強迫他們必須信仰，必須言論……照自由的真諦來講，恐怕有點不妥吧！據南京電訊，政府已開始檢討現行法律，其與新憲法抵觸者擬予盲目或修正。上項限制自由的法律，是否應予修正，似乎很值得檢討。</p>
<p>有人認為在實施經濟管制的時候，假如採取自由入會制，恐怕於政策的推行上要增加困難。這話也自有相當理由。不過本文所重，在人民的自由，不在所謂管制，在憲法的精神，不在枝節的管制手段，這是應當附帶聲明的。</p>

<h3>豫教育界一騙局</h3>
<p>— 開封十二月廿三日航訊　本報駐汴記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>河南教育界怪事可多，本學期開學晚，小學生很在院子里上了一氣課。流亡到這里的青年學生們不是不想搬出各學校，而是沒人管他們——有的機關還是標明是作青年運動工作的，佔的敵偽產業最多，可不讓出來作點好事，每週唱上幾天戲，開食堂什麼的！傷兵住在學校里；就像應該似的。中學學生上課很久了，竟沒作過一次作文！公費學生吃不飽，可是沒管。河南大學的學生不滿意他們的飯桶教授，深感到空虛的悲哀，老在報上呼請各方救救他們。在學校里的學生是這樣，在校外的學生可更多——想入學校很難，沒力讀書的更不用說。光是開封，適齡小學兒童失常約有二十二萬之多。這些現象可沒人來注意，河南教育原是落後的。也就在這些情況下，河南發生一件大騙局——這也正是河南教育界上的大怪事與奇蹟。</p>
<p>獻校騙錢</p>
<p>在很多青年都在失學的情況下，河南產生了一個教育函授學院，院長景中天是「河南鄧縣人氏，年已三十，尚未娶妻，人是坦白，篤實，熱情，刻苦而又負責」，他的朋友，也是他的大助手郝冠儒在騙局揭穿之後，這樣介紹他給社會，而且呌他是河南「武訓」。可是，有人卻說他是個「毛孩子」「大騙子」，就事論事的話，他不是山東的武訓先生，而是山東的梁作友。他很有生意眼，看大學失學青年多，就趁「獻校」的機會，把函授學院就一變而成為「中正學院」了。「學院」已夠吸引人的，而且加上「中正」兩字，當然更非同小可。這個不說，他卻還用「合」口吻的代電致各縣讓「保送」學生呢。好，聞風而來的青年可多，就如郝冠儒說的「學生突然增加起來，滿二百，過三百，不到兩週五百名已過，教室寢室用具一時成了嚴重問題。」我曾經冒着寒風去觀光了一下，所謂「中正學院」也者，是在曹門大街的幾間破房和一座矮小的眼光廟的。房子是破的，學生住在濕潮的地上，一間小辦公室只有一張繳費收錢的桌子，還看到一架油印機，兩個職員是學生調充的。規定學生每名交納十萬元，可憐的青年們湊集了五千多萬元送到河南梁作友的手裏了。</p>
<p>飯桶教授</p>
<p>「學院」也有各系，是些什麼人呢？差不多都是河大飯桶教授，也就是河南梁作友的些「同志」，教務長是楊震華，訓導長是陳梓北，教育主任就是趙萬里，教授是任訪秋，這一流人物。他們狼狽為奸，設下了罪大惡極欺騙可愛青年的騙局。我們來看這批教育騙子致各縣的秘字第三號的戌灰代電吧，上邊有同綏靖公　關防一樣大的關防：</p>
<p>「本院為慶祝蔣主席六秩壽辰，響應各地獻校運動，將河南函授學院主辦之大學講習班改名為中正學院，已於十月三十一日致電蔣主席正式成立，查本院學生來源，前由函授學院函請各縣務函保送，俾資深造，原為訓練中學師資，現旣改為中正學院，性質與一般大學無異，內分數理文史教育藝術法政五系，專事廣造人材，茲以本學期時間較短，各縣保送學生務希按照規定，嚴加考核於十一月底以前持函報到，免試入學……」</p>
<p>這個不說，且看人家的會議記錄上說的吧。十二月八日第一次校務會議決議的：</p>
<p>（一）各縣代報學生報到逾期，如何處理案？決議：一律準予報到。</p>
<p>（二）寢室不能容納，如何處理案？決議：在報到之時通知學生自籌。</p>
<p>（三）報到學生因特殊情形，需請假返里，學籍如何保留案？決議：學籍準保留。</p>
<p>（四）遲到學生功課如何補修案？決議：甲，期考不及格者下期準予補修；乙，不參預考試者重修。</p>
<p>（五）報到繳費後，因特殊情形經學校核準返里者，學費如何處理案？決議：獻校後報到繳費學生，學費學籍均予保留。</p>
<p>（六）學生成績如何處理案？決議：交由教授全權處理。</p>
<p>（七）校舍如何建築案？決議：先建築講堂入座，每座四間，即日開始籌劃，限下期開學前完成。</p>
<p>（八）本院學制如何規定案？決議：採用學分制。</p>
<p>（九）下期是否增加系案？決議：增加新聞系。</p>
<p>騙局揭穿</p>
<p>不用說的話了，就從這帬騙子手的口供上，我們來了解這學院的真像吧。學生繳費了，沒住處，沒教室上課，可以回家，可以保留學籍的，這種「優待」辦法多高明！五千多萬除二千多萬被他們揮霍了以外，有三千多萬是存在商號里的，拿十分息來說吧，一個月就是五百萬的純息呢！這年頭，生財是有道的，看你是不是能「出奇」，在今天，教育界也有「騙錢」的敗類了。</p>
<p>這騙局是怎樣揭穿的呢？原來一些可愛的青年，被騙到開封，洞悉了真相後，向參議會的同鄉追詢究竟，在九日省參會第四次駐委會時，函請教廳出席報告這學府辦理情形，教廳林主任秘書樂天說：「學院前身原為函授學院，先在南陽，係補習教育性質，於獻校運動中，曾直接電蔣主席及教育部，對省府僅是通知請務查，雖然沒獲到覆電，竟擅自正式成立，通知各縣保送學生，旣不論其合乎獻校規定及手續與否，依照法令，保送學生祗限師範生，中大學皆不能保送學生，該院此舉至為不法！上星期獲悉後已簽呈省府請示。」在省府與教育廳只是在法令上着眼的，並沒着眼在欺騙青年，詐取金錢上，省參議會擬定的處理辦法是：</p>
<p>（一）應由教廳尅速將該院明令查封。</p>
<p>（二）應將該院主辦人物送法院訊辦，勿使潛逃。</p>
<p>（三）該院所收學雜各費，一律照數退還，並賠償學生損失。</p>
<p>（四）應由教育廳速電各縣，勿再保送學生，致受欺騙。</p>
<p>（五）將處罰該院情形，分看公諸報端。</p>
<p>在九日夜晚，這位騙子就給拿獲了！</p>
<p>幾千萬的學生血汗錢，已給封存了。</p>
<p>三項意見</p>
<p>這個騙局轟動了整個河南，「河南梁作友」的朋友還四出活動，竟也不顧羞恥的說這騙客是「河南武訓！」真相是擺在這里的，這位大院長已經轉送法院訊辦了。</p>
<p>五百多個可愛的青年，在這騙局里作了最可憐的人物，社會上也最關切他們。十三日他們招待新聞界，慘痛的說：他們為求知，受盡艱苦而來，現在受到這樣的嚴重欺騙，惶惑焦灼，希望愛護他們的人士多多給他們援助！他們提出三項意見：</p>
<p>（一）希望政府將不合法的「中正學院」改為私立大學。</p>
<p>（二）將他們送入即將成立的商專等專門學校。</p>
<p>（三）希望趕快處理這問題，免使他們躭誤學業及光陰。</p>
<p>安揷問題</p>
<p>怎樣處置，現在還沒有知道，輿論界同參議會正在籲請當局注意這五百多個受騙青年的安揷問題！</p>
<p>在河南，教育界怪事多，該也是必然的事。整個的河南都在內亂的迫害中，人民生活在苦難中，在戰火的蹂躪中生活，各方面都是不能看的，各方面都在畸形中進展——教育界怎能例外呢？</p>
<p>這個騙局正表明了河南教育上的嚴重問題，不祇失學青年多，而且亟應把大中小學整頓一下了。在慶祝蔣主席壽誕，獻校運動積極展開時期，出現了這個大騙局，正是一大可憾而且可憤的事！</p>
<p>蘇澳漁港一瞥（本報特派員　江暮雲攝寄）</p>
<p>這裏男女工人總計有五百七十餘人，本省人佔百分之九十八，有的從開廠直做到現在多沒有離開過，經騐豐富，技術嫻熟，是臺省工業界的一批勞苦功高的無名英雄。職員六十八人，外省人約佔百分之三十四，本省約佔百分之五十六，但在這裏沒有絲毫隔閡，融洽非常，人事管理健全後，才說得上生產的增加，何況這是本省僅有的一家橡膠工廠，我對它寄予無限的希望！</p>

<h3>服務道德</h3>
<p>— 鄭家樸講·尤懋銓記</p>
<p>中華民族的國民素講道德，可是現在的道德觀念已隨此次抗戰而薄弱了，所以現在社會上，時常發生一種想像不到的事情。不過一個國家要强盛，一個民族要復興，無論在何種情形下都要講道德！即在一個團體，工廠，行號，甚至家庭間，都應該以道德爲前提。現在我拿「誠」「公」兩字來講：</p>
<p>「誠」：替人家做事須把人家的事情，當做目己的事情，並且要比自己更週到。對待人也應該誠，絕不可有虛偽做作。朱子說「不能感人者，學誠之未至。」如此可知「誠」的意義之重要了。</p>
<p>「公」：無論做什麼事情，祗有捨私利，忘私見，方能達到「公」的地步。同時對於事業方能由「至公」而更進一步敬業，如此自已在事業上也才能獲得成績。</p>
<p>技術在書本上，不過是一般的理論，自舉校而涉足工廠，若不經過一番實地苦幹，實幹，結果所獲得是很有限的。人的天性大都厭勞苦，喜享樂，不過克勝艱苦和困難，養成習慣，當初雖以爲苦，然結果而能够苦盡甘來，並且可從勞中得到快樂。尤其在現在蔣委員長昭示我們「抗戰完成，開始建設」的時候，輕工業方面，紡織業是佔極重要地位，也是衣食住行民生的首要問題。在目前我國已破壞的工廠，因種種條件的限制，恢復已感困難，如果再謀擴充，決非短期內可能實現，不過按照我國四萬五千萬人口計算，衣被不足自給，所以將來一定需要按照具體的計劃來擴充。</p>
<h3>一年之計</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>三十五年的年關渡過以後，一般工商業，好像透了一口氣，雖則即將屆臨的廢曆年關，依舊是壓在心頭的一件大事，有不少廠商正不知道怎樣來應付這一個迫在眉睫的難關。</p>
<p>然而難關終是要過去的，怎樣的過法，當然是另一問題。據筆者的意見，以爲渡過難關固屬重要，對於三十六年的大計，似乎比較更爲重要。</p>
<p>凡是在思念，考慮，怎樣渡過年關的廠商，當局的主管人員，也許會有一種感覺，覺得今年的難關爲什麼這樣的難於打破？雖然明知最大的原因，是由於高利貸。然而怎麼會結欠了這麼龐大的一筆數目？因此渡過難關以後，一定要好好地做，所謂好好地做，就是說要謹愼地做，或者是指有計劃的做。</p>
<p>本來任何廠商都脫不了三個最重要的部門就是「生產」，「銷售」，和「經濟調度」。以言生產，那末工資這末大，生活指數按月增加，困難重重。以言銷售，那末交通未全恢復，地域未能開拓，即使銷，也甚有限。以言經濟調度，那末更是費力，有不少廠商，每天的最大部份的時間，而且要緊的時間，要化費在銀根的調度上，移東補西，捉襟見肘，</p>
<p>然而事實上決沒有這樣理想的辦法，可以做好事業。無論生產，銷售，和經濟調度，都是片刻不能分離，而且是要相輔而行的。萬一有顧此失彼的情形發生，就會使整個機構失去平衡，久而久之，終至弄得不可收拾。</p>
<p>「預防勝於治療」本來是一句是最有價値的話，在產業界加以應用，更有價値。目前一般人所忙着的是治療的工作而不是預防的工作，因此治療尙且不能完善，甚至於頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，怎能談到預防？</p>
<p>但是仔細想來，預防的工作是可以做的，而且是一個基本的工作，本年的新正，就應該制定全年的生產計劃，設計完善而整套的統計圖表，預算表。這一件艱巨而重大的工作不妨集合整個組織的每一個重要部門，費幾日幾夜的功夫來完成。然後照着這個計劃分工合作，使到了相當時候，主管人員，可以看着表格，取決一切，不必手忙脚亂，使步伐零亂散漫。</p>
<p>在擬具這個訂劃的時候，對於生產方面，要考查各種出品歷年銷售數字的增减，來決定那幾種應該繼續維持，那幾種應該停止生產，因爲所生產的出品種類過多，是使周轉不靈的一個重要原因。</p>
<p>對於銷售方面，應該考查每一個地方，每一個區域，以往的銷路，現有的銷路，和可能的銷路。再利用有效的廣告，配合起來，必須有整個計劃。在目前這個緊要關頭，如果再是知其然而不知其所以然，那末就要產生許多困困難了。</p>
<p>至於經濟調度，那末可以說是使生產銷售平衡而同時又是生產與銷售的原動力。目前一般廠商，都因流動資金的缺乏而依賴高利貸來飲鴆止渴。</p>
<p>在學理上，所謂流動資金，就是「流動資產之可以應用於事業的經營的」。這一個定例比較：「流動資金，就是流動資產和流動負債之間的差額」更爲恰當，更爲適合目前的環境。因爲流動資金是絕對地需要具有伸縮性的。</p>
<p>要做經濟調度的工作，統計，預算，圖表是最好的工具，沒有道些工具，那末等於一艘船缺少了羅盤，今天要應付一筆巨大的支山，明天要應付一筆到期的借款。事務的進行，永久沒有正常的一天。</p>
<p>環境方面，再也不允許我們失去正常，因此如果再沒有周詳的計劃，那末不但不能造成環境，必然爲環境所支配，甚至因環境而犧牲。</p>
<p>過去的已成過去未來的一切，正等待着我「好自爲之」想工商界有識之士，一定具有同感。</p>
<h3>美國職業婦女與勞工部</h3>
<p>— 費文</p>
<p>今日美國的職業婦女爲數的近一千七百萬人。在一八七〇年，職業婦女還不及二百萬人。這七十多年之間，婦女不斷地爲改善工作情形，提高就業水準和爭取男女待蟣及機會均等而奮鬥。</p>
<p>起初，機器時代到臨後，自家庭走向工廠的婦女日益加多，婦女支薪的事涉及諸多問題。那時婦女大部無組織，無訓練，且受成見影響，沒有多大進步，因此婦女被迫接受任何職業，不顧條件，較男人受到更大的剝削。婦女不能克服這種情形，她們就向政府中州和聯邦政府—求助，與危害她們就業的因素搏戰。</p>
<p>在第二次大戰前，沿着這方面去的進步很慢。可是大戰爆發後，各方空前需要女工來接充出征軍人遺留下來的職業。婦女遂進入各種工業和位置，代替男子，甚至幹起危險性極大的工作來。她們得到新的技術，她們暸解改善工作情形的組織的意義，她們向自己和世界證實了婦女除傳統的理家和撫育子女的工作外，他們還能夠勝任各業中許多工作。</p>
<p>截至一九一八年七月八日止，美國勞工部祇有五年餘的歷史，其時勞工部設立了一個臨時性質的工業婦女服務處，任務在於保障戰時職業婦女。這種臨時機構以後就成爲永久性的，且有更廣泛的工作目標。婦女和種種揭發剝削職業婦女利益的進步力量促使政府成立一永久性的機關，這個機關的任務在於聲援並協助婦女達成下列各種目標：</p>
<p>男女就業和升遷機會均等；不應有性別，種放，年齡或婚姻上的不公平歧視；調查職業婦女薪組，務使比項薪給足够豐裕，健康的生活需求，工作時間不得超出每日八小時或每週四十小時的規定，工作時間不得定在晚間；在工人應與機器的速度配合工作的工業中，婦女應有間歇休息的時間；女工在工作塲所用膳時工廠應規定從容的時間並應有舒適的設備；工作塲所應具備淸潔，空氣良好和光綫充足的條件；工塲應該設置保險機及其他預防災禍的設備；充足而且淸潔的工作設備；進步的人事管理方法；和集體談判的機會。</p>
<p>一九二〇年六月，國會將臨時的工業婦女服務處改爲永久性機關，並在勞工部內設立一婦女局。這個機關的設立誠是職業婦女的歷史的里程牌，實際上也可以說是所有職業人士的歷史的里程牌。到了一九二〇年，職業婦女的數字就增至八百五十萬人，的佔全國勞工總人數五分之一。婦女局當即與所有已就業的和求業中的婦女取得密切聯繫，不諭其種族，信仰或婚姻情形如何，婦女局當即與所有職業領域裏的婦女打成一片。</p>
<p>婦女局初期所幹的多是補救種種缺感的工作。爲了料正錯誤的見解，該局發表正確的消息和統計數字，這些消息和統計數字都是很據調查各工廠，辦公室，儲藏所和訪問婦女的結果而作的。爲了決定該局的政策和計劃，它又舉辦各種關於女工健康等問題的測騐和研究。婦女局爲女工而決定的政策和標準也是愼重考慮和徵詢其他組職（如州勞工部，勞工組織和資方代表）意見的結果。</p>
<p>今日報導職業婦女情形的公報已有二百種，此外還有小冊子，新聞信和電影，足供人們採用。婦女界最近刊印書刊多種，其中如『電話女工』，『家庭職業婦女』，『同等薪給法規』等是。那些關於職業婦女工作時間，工資，和工作情形的報吿尤具重要性，那種應允各方請求或與勞工機關長官共同進行的調查常爲採取立法行動的根據。</p>
<p>該局並不能制定任何法規，然而它却積極研究關於現有或擬議中的法規問題，並時常提出建議。今日，關於規定婦女薪給和工作時間的立法工作已有相當進步。在各州中，幾乎有四分之三（波多里哥和阿拉斯加也包括在內）都有最低薪法規。規定婦女工時每日不得超過八小時或每週四十四小時的州的佔各州的半數</p>
<p>婦女局也可以算是一個獲得消息的源泉。每遇必要，它就隨時以技術上的忠吿，事實和數字供給與公共機關，婦女組織，工會，資方和羣衆。</p>
<p>在婦女活動方面，今日婦女局已佔有愈益重要的地位。在過去三十年間，婦女局在婦女職業方面已獲相當可觀的進展。婦女局雖覺得距離其最後目標尙遠，它已審度變動中的經濟情形，擬定了未來計劃以適於戰後紀元的發展和緊急需求。</p>

<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>人事管理的實施一，招請：</p>
<p>在一個企業組織需要職員或一個製造工廠需要勞工的時候，就要設法雇用，在人浮於事的時候招請職工是很便利的，一旦發表出去，就有許多人來應徵，在那些應徵的人之間，做一番甄別的工作，就可以得到所需要的職工，但在職工不易招致的時候，就要考慮到怎樣使職工樂於參加的方法，這可以從職工方面着想，一般職工，願意就一個職業，總有幾個理由，或者是由於薪給數目的可觀或是供給膳宿，或是離家很近或是有額外的津貼或者是由於企業組織的範圍很大，將來的生活可以有相當的保障，或者是由於那企業組織，是一個有希望有前途的事業。</p>
<p>在上列幾種原因之中，不一定能够完全都具備，那末或者有了一二種，也可以使職工願意參加。</p>
<p>在通常需要職工的時候，下列幾種方法是時常被應用的：</p>
<p>甲，登報，在各地較大的報紙上，大都有分類廣吿，其中有聘請一欄，當一個企業組織在需要雇用職工時，就可以登幾次廣吿，通常需要應徵者，寫明年齡，籍貫，學歷，經歷，需要的待遇，有時需附照片，有時候需要附一封自薦信，所調自薦信，就是在信中寫明自己的姓名年齡籍貫，已婚或未婚，以往的履歷和希望的酬報等，在登報的時候，如果不願意給外界知道企業組織的名稱（避免熟人介紹）那末可以用郵政信箱，由應徵者把應徵函件，寄到郵政信箱裏去。</p>
<p>乙，待聘攔：在報紙的分類廣吿裏，除了聘請一欄之外，尙有待聘一欄，也可以留意，但要雇用一二個職員，那末可以看看這待聘欄，要雇用大批的職工時是不可能的。</p>
<p>丙，職業指導所：上海中華職業敎育社辦有一個職業指導所，社會部也辦有職業介紹所凡是求職的人，都到那裏去登記，如果需要職員的時候請他們介紹也是一個辦法。</p>
<p>丁，各學校，在雇用職員的時候致函各學校，請學校當局推薦介紹，也是一個辦法，但要招請有經騐的職員時就不能適用這個辦法，因爲剛從學校裏出來的學生，並沒有辦事的經騐的。</p>

<h3>科學的文藝論</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>文藝是科學的前驅，科學與文藝的關係，早就被學術界所認識，歐洲有文藝複興運動，才連帶地挑起宗敎革命和科學的昌明。因這文藝是不能離開現實的，祇有自命這『藝術至上主義』的作家們，才躱避在飄渺的天國，企圖從一粒沙子中，窮究宇宙人生的微妙，同情於造化中的花，草，蟲，魚，由同情而體會，由體會而感悟，把體會到的，感悟到的當作十規的夜啼，黃鶯的歌唱，聊以自慰心靈的寂寞。至於一般追求眞理的作家們，並不急於尋覓自己的安慰，他們有時候甚至不關心自己的生活，正因這他們已把全心靈關注社會，人生和一切酸甜苦辣的現實。他們是以搜尋現實，反映現實，揭禾現實這秘密，這終極的目的，無上的喜悅；因此，科學的精神，是明朗，正確，要改造黑暗的現實，放射眞理的光輝，增進人生的幸福，文藝也是一樣。</p>
<p>所謂『藝術良心』是什麼？最透澈的解釋，就是」見義勇這，嫉惡如仇』的精神。當作家們在處理現實的課題時接觸到社會的黑暗面，不失望也不悲觀，常是抱着積極的革命能度，宗敎家的信心與熱忱，力求消除黑暗的因素的；而那些躲在黑暗的羽翼下，自甘沒落，鬼鬼祟祟，阻碍進步的份子，正是應該消滅的因素。他們對作家的愛管閒事不能讓自己躱在昏天黑地的角洛裏，盡量享受荒淫無恥的生活，自然是深深痛恨，必欲置之死地而後快；這與科學家的遭受百昔羅馬敎皇的殘殺，遭受一切封建勢力的陷害，又復如出一轍；所以，科學的仇敵，也就是文藝的仇敵；而爲一要使科學的順利進展，在科學的道路上，不顧一切，擔任了掃淸那些絆脚石的工作，却是文藝。科學是時代的推進機，文藝就是推進科學的原動力，文藝的熱情的火燄，能這科學家燒燬陳腐的桎梏，使科學家有着思考的自由，發明的自由，終與文藝合流，發出洶涵澎湃的波濤，匯成時代的主潮，冲散人生的逆流，創造人類的新世紀。</p>
<p>文藝由於科學的進步也能使文藝獲得新的啓示，文藝家常在科學的世界，發現宇宙和人生的秘密，使字彙更豐富，描寫的形象更眞賞，追求的理想更宏遠。這就是說，科學家可以不涉獵文藝的作品，而文藝家却不能不接受科學的洗禮，以求瞭解科學上的成果。例如；我們要描寫季候的變化，天象的晦冥，日月星辰的明暗，草木花卉的興衰，蟲魚鳥獸的生滅，假使缺乏自然科學的知識，是不能勝任的；到現在文藝的寫作範圍，早就擺脫『藝術至上主義』的枷鎖，從個人的抒情，擴大到人生的描寫，逼迫作家們要到社會的各方面，捕捉成這問題的現實，用作解答的課題，文藝乃急切地渴望着社會學，經濟學，歷史學的帮助；同時，你倘要分析人性，解剖人生，這人類指禾光明的道路，又必須要有哲學，心理學……等好的較高淵的素養。此外，文藝工作者更應常常離開寫字間，跑到工作的崗位上，在工作中體騐實際的生活，學習那些不是書本中所能傳導的活知識，譬如，你要寫勞工，就得直接到工廠，農塲，礦山裏去，觀察他們的賞生活，研究他們眞賞的經濟現象抓出他們苦痛的癥結，這樣說，關於研究社會問題的書，作家們實在也有瀏覽的必要。</p>
<p>有很多作家常因這對於某一種科學有更淵博的修養，受到深刻的影響而顯示着作品的特點。如劇作家高爾貼華綏是熟習法律的律師，在「正義」這劇本中攻擊英國的牢獄制度，就表現他是深懂個中三昧的內行，而使劇本在演出時，引起肚會的重視，使政府不得不進行牢獄的改善；契柯夫是醫科大學的學生，對病理學，解剖學有研究，因此，他常利用着描寫和分析精神病患者得到驚人的成就。在道裏，呵見科學思想不僅能豐當文學的內容，而對於文學的技術上的帮助，也是功不可泯。</p>
<p>在科學發展到到原子彈的今天，人類文明必伴隨科學的高度進步，起着劇烈的變化，而人生的變幻，將如萬花簡似的，五光十色，無從捉摸。因此，文藝工作者這要適應原子彈的世紀滿足新人在新階段所鴻盼的新要求，則在文藝的園地內，也得要另換一套新方法從事播種和耕耘，是必然的。從前是文藝推進科學，文藝是推進科學的原動力，現在科學已跑到前面，文藝要跟隨科學進趕，在科學的世界裏再學習了！如果文藝工作者故步自封，自滿於已有的陳法，睥睨一切，沾沾自喜，必被新科學所掀起的浪潮，淹沒於海底。一九四五，廿四於重慶</p>
<h3>詩談片</h3>
<p>— 林風</p>
<p>大地是荒凉的，詩人給栽上花朶，人類是隔絕的，詩人給架上橋樑；社會是冰冷的，詩人給帶來陽光；哲人探索眞理，而詩人却把眞理播種在人的心裏。</p>
<h3>漓江之冬</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>桂林的冬天，是看不見飄雪的日子。朗爽的秋天過後，樹木隨西風凋索，青錄色的山鋒，變成籃靛般深黑的色澤，嶙峋峻峭的石壁，都裸露出原形了。遠近疏落的山頭，靜靜地立在灕江邊，像一個老人守侯着歲殘的末李，一天天淡然逝去。</p>
<p>漓江的水，即是在深冬，水面也不會結起薄薄的冰層。江水在冷寂的岸難，挨過一些石嚴，淸澄暢逸地流去，這時的江面，比不上河床秋漲時的盈滿了。</p>
<p>站在中正橋上，或乘小民艇擺渡江中，這樣瀏覽灕江的山水，會感覺到冬天的向然景物，確是容淡而消瘦了。若人在其中，能與自然渾淪一起，那麼人生江湖潦落的况味，也會突然襲上了心頭。</p>
<p>灕江的冬天，雖沒有冰雪，不像別的地方，稍一佇立江頭，便令人寒不可耐；然灕江一到隆冬，江上和岸灘也便很少人跡。只有每天淸晨，在微雨飄搖，白霧迷濛江面，鉛色的天空，壓得了很低，遼遠江干的山峰，只留下一點渺茫的影子。這時三五隻竹排，便一隊隊地出現在江上。魚人披着笠衣，慢慢的搖着漿，任竹排上的鷺　，輕捷的潛進水裏去捕魚。自晨至暮，他們隨意的來去。這是冬天裏的灕江，隨處可見的小景。看他來去悠然，自得其樂，可是在生活的鞭策下，他們正不知又有幾許的酸辛？</p>
<p>灕江之冬，是美而寂寞的，隨烽火洗刧後，接着又蒙上了災患。我想今年她是更形消瘦了！</p>

<h3>記劉大杰</h3>
<p>— 復君</p>
<p>遠在二十年以前，那時正是一般文藝靑年，傾心於新文藝作品的時候；魯迅郭沫若郁達夫的作品，眞不知瘋魔了多多少少的少年男女。尤其是對於魯迅的「吶喊」「彷徨」，郭沫若的「女神」「星空」，和郁達夫的「迷羊」「日記九種」等等輝煌作品，使文藝靑年們服膺醉心，視這無上的漢寳。就在這時候，有個未名社，由魯迅先生主持其事，出版了一套未名叢書，其中就已經列有劉大杰先生的創作專集。</p>
<p>和當時許多的作家一樣，大杰先生創作的內容逃不了抒寫那時的一些少男少女的苦悶情緒，描繪的對象大多都是學校的環境，但也有一小部分是那時的破落農村的眞實小故事；不過，無論如何，大杰的作品和當時的大多數作家一樣，寫的多是兩性間的戀愛悲喜劇而已。初期文字直率，熱情磅礴，是一般作家的共同的特色，實不僅大杰一人是如此的。日久之後，文字由直率進而至於精緻，熱情也就無初時的澎湃飛騰不可收拾之勢了。到了最近的十年，大杰光生的作品，照我個人的私見，實在是和巴金同走一條路的，他們兩人都以熱情奔放見稱於世，不過，寫作態度的比較深厚穩重，還得先推大杰，巴金到底不免過於太「放心」了。</p>
<p>具有一個頎長的身材，面貌平常，但兩眼有力，態度瀟洒，說話帶有湖南口音。和他談話，聽他的授課或演請，無有不被他的滔滔不絕的談鋒所折服的。是在十五年前的一個夏天吧，我從遙遠的北國，轉學到上海來，在一個大學敎室裏聽過他幾小時的「文藝思潮」「詞選」等課程，那時正是炎日似火，風影絕跡，但是一個小小的敎室中到底擠滿了人，大家誰都忘懷了溽暑的天氣，也毫不以人多天熱而感到局促和窒息，只是覺得大杰先生的講詞優越，娓娓動聽，正如一個旅人，長途跋涉後突然發見了一泓泉水一樣的愉快！我是至今都還引以這憾事的，我沒有福氣多聽大杰先生的功課；實在自己讀的並不是文學，而對於文學倒是老早就許下願心，以迄於今日。</p>
<p>大杰先生著作極多，由中華大柬北新等書局出版，他曾主編過「現代學生」「海潮」等刊物，現任國立暨大文學院長。近年來似少寫作，但是他早已從文藝創作轉變這對中國古籍的整編工作，尤其是詩詞，他是有過不少的佳作的。大杰夫人李輝羣也是一個女作家，會編有「歷代女子詩選」「歷代女子詞選」兩書，均由中華書局出版。她現在上海市立第一女中任敎，這也是値得我門附帶提及的。</p>
<h3>THE　MAGDALEN</h3>
<p>— 狄湘</p>
<p>狄湘（Titian　1482-1576）從小不愛普通學科，一天到晚的亂圖亂畫，終於達成他的志願，成這維尼斯派的權威畫家。THE　MAGDALFN是由聖經取材的——賣淫婦。作風堅實，色調輝皇，筆觸細膩，小部均不放鬆。除「花神」外，此作可稱代表。（獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血139</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>確實的，要是鶴見的計劃失敗，那麼，一切都操在近衛手中，半小時也行，一小時也行，甚至於十年十年都行。要是計劃成功的話，九　鐘，人舉已經初步發動了；十點左右，也針是鶴見將進別府之前，第二步計劃，也已賞現；一大部分人馬，應該已經襲入了別府這座花閱裏了。往下，十一點左右，那就應該大爆發了。換句話，要是鶴見計劃成功，一切都應該操在鶴見的手中。時間的話，是應該由鶴見來控制。</p>
<p>但是事實却已經證明，鶴見並沒有控制了時間，反之，却是給時間控制着的；因他手表的長短兩針，都指在十一點上了。他在這間華麗的客室內，已經呆坐了近半小時了。這半個小時，可眞不容易混過去哩，起先，每隔五六分鐘，要看一次表，每看一次表的時間距離內，腦筋中不知要起多少翻騰：「街道上這什麼那樣靜蕩蕩地？」「安坂難道不能指揮？」「〇十二不會誤事？」「決不可能；要是有什麼差錯，他們應該給我一點消息，決不能讓我一個人懸在半空的危險裏，宕來宕去」</p>
<p>距離預定的十一點鐘愈近，鶴見看表的决數也愈加多了；每兩分鐘，每一分鐘，一次一次的看表；到了近十一點的當中，簡直把手臂彎着，一雙眼睛，就注射在表面上，瞧着那隻小秒針一下一下，有規律的挪動着。</p>
<p>「完了！」表上那隻長針，端端正正，已經指到十二點上，短針已經到了十一點，秒針也一下一下挪過了六十分刻的劃綫上。「然而……」鶴見兩隻耳朶的聽覺和經，有些轟轟的響着，表示全郃神經，已經緊張過度，起了劇烈變動了。幸而有了「然而」這麼一個小小的思想轉變，才把過度緊張的神經，舒展了一些些。</p>
<p>「然而」什麼？他想到了他計劃上的時間，並沒有十分尅準九時正，十時正，十一時正等。因這時計這東西，可靠而又不可靠，總有些快慢或停頓毛病。而且，這一類的秘密工作，照經騐上說，不應該把時間尅得太準，只能幾點到幾點之間，或是幾點鐘左右。用了「左右」兩字，並非把時限放寬；乃是說，能够準時，那是最好，但秘密工作，多少有些阻碍，萬一不能準時動手的話，有了「左右」兩字，就可把時限稍稍放鬆了。他計劃的大爆發時刻，乃是「十一點左右」。</p>
<p>不過這也是鶴見自譬自解的話，把緊張的心理，略略弛放一些罷了。照他向來辦事的習慣，他本人是一分一秒都不肯錯誤的。這時到了十一點，還沒有信號送來，他認這已經有些不美了；計劃的進行，一定有了極大的挫折，也許遭遇了極大的阻碍。</p>
<p>這「左右」的字樣，當然也有一個限度，不是嗎？左到多少？右到多少？五分，十分，十五分？大約總不應該超過十五分鐘。但他的手表長鐘已經指到一點上，那隻秒鐘，可厭得很，仍舊不休不止，一下一下，朝前轉動着。鶴見有些坐不住了；一躍身，從沙號裏站了起來。</p>
<p>自從那個西原秘書離了這客室之後，偌大一個別府，竟聽不見一絲響動。這個客室門外的走道，照理應該是這座建築這一部分的來往要道，然而竟聽不到一點脚步聲。雖設已經快到午夜，然而西原明明說近衛還在辦公；辦公總也應該有人幫忙，至少總有幾個侍候的人，這什麼一點響動也沒有？惟一的解釋，那西原口裏的話，也許是一種烟幕；要不，近衛辦公約地方，也許不在這一部分？</p>
<p>難道不能跑到客室門外窺探一下？至少也，可走到門邊，靠近門縫偸聽一下。這却不能；而且萬萬做不得。根據鶴見那複雜而又機警的心理去推測，去斷定，要是自己的計劃不失敗，事情一完在着着進展，也許稍有躭擱，延遲這麼十分八分鐘，也是可能的事，也就用不着自己窺探，偸聽了。換一方面說，要是不妙的話，計劃已經失收，他在這裏，等於軟禁；也許牆壁上正有幾雙眼睛在監視他的行動。萬一亂來一下，必定發生更不美的後果。</p>
<p>他只能在各室的空處，來回　躋着；這是坐久了必有的行動，受不着指責。這什麼時時看表？那也可以答辯：因爲西原說過，近衛辦公，還有半小時以上，看看表，不過要知道時間到了沒有。這些行動，並不越軌。然而要出門窺探，或靠門縫偸聽，雖說仍舊可以强辯，至少是失去了君子和軍人的這兩種身份了。</p>

<h3>三毛</h3>
<p>— 張樂平</p>
<h3>大赦</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>國民政府於元旦公布大赦令，看了它的內容，覺得所赦免的範圍十分寬大，除去漢奸罪，貪汚罪，殺直系尊親罪，煙毒而處死刑遠期徒刑者等不予赦免外，其餘各罪，俱減二分之一，或槪予赦免。所以有人在計算，糧貸案各罪犯可以赦免了，艷屍案主犯可以免死了，什麼什麼可以處刑減半了，…這種推測自然是極有根據的，而這些在獄人卻很幸運地能感受到這個千載一時的恩典了。</p>
<p>本來在去年元旦，勝利後第一個元旦日，國府就有頒布大赦令的可能，而其所以延遲一年的，也許為了勝利剛剛來臨，一切千頭萬緒，加以戰爭罪犯和漢奸罪犯的偵查審訊，和淪陷後的各地司法機關待整理之故，而未及舉行，現在，這些問題都已告一段落，而憲法又於元旦正式公布，國家這一崇恩特典，於此時頒佈，正是十分適合！</p>
<p>不管將來有多少人蒙受到這恩惠，我們以為司法機關應讓這些獲得赦免的人能明暸政府頒佈此特典的用意，如果糊糊塗塗地放出去，不僅有失隆重，且易啓人們徼倖之心。</p>
<h3>美國最大動物園中　十大動物素描</h3>
<p>— 鮑鐘祺</p>
<p>在最近的五十年中，有九千六百萬的遊客到美國紐約的Bronx動物園去參觀，據說都是為了慕十大動物之名而來一睹廬山真面目的。這裏且把這十大動物以遊客評價高低的前後，瞻列於後：</p>
<p>熊貓小姐</p>
<p>獲得第一名的是我國的「榮譽出品」——熊貓小姐，她的步行姿態活像一頭熊，無數的成人及小孩們圍住了她，因為她最有趣而是最稀少珍貴的動物——（在遙遠中國的山地中，一共祗曾獵獲了八頭，其中一半是贈與美國的），熊貓現在美國頗受殊榮，所吃的珍餚是弗羅立達州來的嫩竹。</p>
<p>長臂猿</p>
<p>第二名是綽號呌「母親」的長臂猿，她庇護着生養才十五個月的“Junior”，不讓人們拍照，假使你一定要拍的話，她會認你不懷好意而對住攝影機怒目而視的，她有時很活潑，但有時卻沉郁固執得非常，她有一個怪脾氣，就是不願在水漕中飲水，寗可用指蘸來吃。</p>
<p>海獅</p>
<p>第三名是二頭海獅，他們曾咆哮着要吃中飯，或狂呌逗戲來賓賓，他們的皮膚色澤非常光亮，善於開着嘴向你要魚吃。</p>
<p>大猩猩</p>
<p>第四名是Makoao——一個大猩猩，這是一個外表非常強暴的動物，他的蹙額與皺鼻顯出他個性的謹嚴倔強，他的步行態度也很像一個人。</p>
<p>和善的象</p>
<p>第五名是和善的象，他的身體大得像樹幹，看了簡直使人發笑，他那大而能　動的耳像一棵落花生類的植物，這裏所有的三隻中，二隻是印度來的，一隻是非洲種。</p>
<p>黑腳企鵝</p>
<p>第六名是黑腳的企鵝——那個專門食魚的動物，人們常被他蹴踢，因為他也能直立而行，像人一樣的，他有白的「領帶」，不過多了一個尾。</p>
<p>蜂鳥</p>
<p>第七名是蜂鳥，他的長長的鳥喙和美麗的翼翅吸引了很多的遊客，他所被飼食的是動物園內自製的甘美花蜜。</p>
<p>山老虎</p>
<p>第八名是兩個山老虎，他們的行動很柔軟文雅，而且非常的聰明，也可以說是刁滑，乖施巧計，作弄人類。</p>
<p>獅子</p>
<p>第九名是一隻獅子，他並不十分伶俐，但事實上差不多每個人都歡喜他，原因是他的外表儀態是生得那麼的聰明漂亮，高貴大方，尤其是他的吼聲，更為動人。</p>
<p>蜘蛛</p>
<p>第十名是「黑寡婦蜘蛛」，倒也吸引了不少遊客的興趣，雖然有毒，不過她卻不傷人，因此，也有許多人喜歡接近她。</p>
<p>譯完了上面這段文字；我們對於中國（尤其是上海）的動物園不禁產生了無限的感慨。</p>
<h3>世界聞名的蘇格蘭警察</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>節譯自本期世界週刊</p>
<p>蘇格蘭警察總局的大名，傳遍了各國，他們辦案的敏捷，揖兇的奇秘，的確令人不可思議，一般人譽為「虎阱」，是有相當價值的。</p>
<p>地下工作</p>
<p>蘇格蘭警總局，是英倫警察的總司令部，英國重要機關，都歸該局的保護，權力很大，直屬內務部，不受地方官吏的節制。總部在泰晤士河畔，建築宏壯，樓高八層，辦公室有一千多間。地下開闢隧道，四通八達，隧道的出入口，或為汽車公司，或為電影院，或為大商店，人們但見總部門前非常安靜，殊不知隧道中的汽車，往來忙碌，沒有間歇的時間，真是神妙莫測。</p>
<p>嚴密完備</p>
<p>警總局人數，共約三萬左右，總局長一人，副局長一人，警官二百二十人，巡長三千零八人。設防禦，維持，偵探，編輯，稽查，司法，電報等部。部有部長。負責處理一部的事務。防禦部是防禦對方的暗算或襲擊，槍械的堅利，配備的整齊，無異一支勁旅；維持部是維持地方秩序，糾正不合法的集會結社。該部警察，平日不帶武器，態度很和氣；偵探部是探求線索，偵查秘密，人數眾多，大都隱散在工商各界，乘機刺探，消息靈通，編輯部是編輯各種報章，現有日報，晚報，星期報，警報數種，每年的印刷經費，也大得驚人；稽查部是化騐毒物，研究被害人致死的原由，僅指模一項，有二萬五千餘種，十分精細。其他各部，也組織嚴密，異常完備的。</p>

<h3>生命太短促，小事何必介意！</h3>
<p>— 春良譯自「本週文摘」</p>
<p>「生命太短促，小事何必介意，」這是我所最心愛的名句，那名句曾使我在許多痛苦的經歷中得到過幫助。往往，我們讓自己，為了一些應該忽略和遺忘了的區區小事，而弄得心煩意亂。或者為了我們所曾幫助過他的那個男人，竟對我們忘恩負義……或者為了我們所認為朋友的那個女人，卻在背後講我們的壞話……或者為了，我們心中以為必屬於我的酬報，結果卻為別人所得。像這一類的事使我們覺得非常失望，以致於我們不能夠工作，或是不能夠入睡。但是，那豈不是太可笑嗎？此地，我們在世上祗有數十年可活，我們覺得許多富貴得無以替代的時間損失掉了而去思念着那些無謂的煩惱，並且，一年之後，那件事就會被我們，也會被任何人，忘記得乾乾凈凈的了。不如讓我們把我們自己的生命供獻給有價值的工作和情緒，供獻給偉大的思想，真實的愛情，以及轟轟烈烈的事業！因為生命太短促，小事何必介意呀！</p>
<h3>青年外交家　蘇聯新外長葛羅米柯</h3>
<p>— 彌山</p>
<p>蘇聯內閣會議最近任命了葛羅米柯為外交部次長——那是大家所熟悉的蘇聯青年外交家，現任駐聯合國安理會的蘇聯代表。</p>
<p>有着漂亮，頎長的篻，漆黑的頭髮，老穿着深青色筆挺的西裝，襯衣加上法國式的領口，在安理會中，葛羅米柯是最年輕漂亮的一位，今年才祗三十八歲。新聞記者們習稱他為「不發表意見的人」，因為他在會議或宴席上，從不向詢問他的記者發表過任何意見。偶而，也向記者回答二句：「今天天氣還算不錯」之類牛頭不對馬嘴的話，或者當攝影記者向他拍照時，會淡淡的頷首微笑。此外，對較重要些的事件，他確實是一個「不發表意見的人」。</p>
<p>他是蘇聯最高委員會的委員，曾經兩次獲得列寗榮譽獎章，現在是史大林元帥的心腹，共產黨的要角。他在蘇聯官塲上真可說是一帆風順，在莫斯科經濟學院畢業後，做了兩年教書匠，才三十歲便就任外交部的美洲司司長，幹了沒有多少時候，就派到駐美大使館做顧問。一九四三年就任為蘇聯駐美大使。</p>
<p>他代表蘇聯出席國際性的會議，第一次就是在就任大使後出席的桷樹會議；第二次是一九四五年的舊金山會議；（他是蘇聯出席該會代表團的中席。）第三次便是這次聯合國的安全理事會。</p>
<p>他在安理會中一貫的外交技巧，是把聯合國憲章加上蘇聯的解釋，抨擊英美等西文國家危害和平。因此，安理會產生了許多棘手的問題。當然，這不能歸咎於葛羅米柯一人，然而他對「西文國家聯合打倒蘇聯」的猜疑無疑地非常強烈。他在安理會討論伊朗問題席上，曾說：「最近有某些份子，利用蘇伊關係，激動世界政治空氣，來幫助某些集團的行動，鼓吹制造新的戰爭。」他為了伊朗問題還曾一怒而走出會塲。</p>
<p>他和別的蘇聯大使一樣，平時不大參加宴會，只喜歡打打球，下下棋。他會說一口極流利的英語，但在公共塲所，他只講俄語，從不用英語。他常向翻譯糾正被譯錯了的詞句。</p>
<p>他有着一個十七歲的兒子，和一個九歲的女兒，家庭裏融洩無間。在紐約的旅館裏，他不大吃美國大菜，卻常教他的夫人煮着俄羅斯的農家土味。</p>

<p>上海勞資紛爭，由罷工轉變到怠工，由怠工轉變到開門謝客了。</p>
<h3>冬防</h3>
<p>— 保哲</p>
<p>俾聞日昨　　路發生盜刦，匪徒竟有十八人之眾，且各持新武器，警察二人反被其繳械。幸虧只有二個，如果多的話，倒可與外國「神槍手」媲美。</p>

<h3>愛國家　敬國旗</h3>
<p>— 吳大權</p>
<p>在上海，凡屬新開店，照習俗都扯上一面國旗，一片紅光，喜氣洋洋，算討上個吉利。</p>
<p>此翻聯合商塲開幕，亦不能免俗，而且因為商塲旣稱聯合，商店自不止一片，因此扯出來的國旗，亦不止一面，隨風招展，蔚為大觀，日本雨淋，百無禁忌。</p>
<p>若是該聯合商塲是推銷國貨的，插十幾面國旗，就它提倡國貨立塲論，還講得過去，但是以國旗濫作商塲的裝飾品總覺得不大好。</p>
<p>國旗為國家的標識，有代表國家之意味存在，一不應妄用，二應勤加尊敬和愛護，而國人對於自己的國旗卻大都隨便馬虎，無怪漢奸之流也以國旗殉葬了。</p>

<h3>「棄權」以後</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>原子能委會通過了美國的建議，已把報告書送呈安理會。根據美國的建議，國際間應成立一個管制原子的機構，並賦予極大的權力，監督各國對於原子能是否作適當的應用，而大國在這一國際機構中，不得使用「否決權」，在懲罰違背原子公約國家時，無須取得各國的一致同意。蘇聯對於「否決權」的取消，當然反對，對於樹立監督制度，反對尤烈，生怕有人窺破她國內的秘密似的。但是在原子能委會表決美國建議時，她並沒有直接爽快地投它一下反對票，而是像溫吞水一樣地來一個之棄權。棄權？這中間含蓄極多，或許還有許多好戲會從「棄權」中　演出來。</p>

<h3>The Majority of Military Reorganization Work Completed; Executive Headquarters and Pacification Headquarters Scale Back; Northeast Executive Headquarters Implements New System</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Following the Political Consultative Conference's resolution, the government implemented military reorganization, reducing groups into armies, armies into divisions, and divisions into brigades. This has been largely completed. Preparations for establishing peacetime national defense division and regimental districts are also underway successively. The conditions for the nationalization of the military are generally in place. According to the military reorganization plan, the Chairman's Executive Headquarters and Pacification Commissioner's Offices should be abolished immediately. However, due to the complex task of pacifying refugees in various pacification zones, and because the Executive Headquarters and Pacification Commissioner's Offices have traditionally served as military-political institutions, their immediate abolition would impact the facilities in the pacification zones. Therefore, the authorities have decided to temporarily retain them, but their scope will be reduced as appropriate. It is reported that the General Affairs and Military Law Departments of the original Executive Headquarters and Pacification Commissioner's Offices will retain their original names. The Political Affairs Department will be renamed the Civil Affairs Department, and the Political Department will be renamed the Press Department. All inspection offices will be abolished, and their duties will be integrated into relevant departments. The number of personnel to be reduced will be about one-third, and this is expected to be implemented soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] After the Northeast Executive Headquarters was ordered to reorganize, it implemented a new system starting from the 5th. The former Secretariat and the five departments of Military Affairs, Personnel, Intelligence, Transportation, and Aviation Police were abolished. The Logistics Department will be temporarily closed due to business reasons. The General Affairs and Military Law Departments remain as before. New offices have been established for the Chief of Staff's Office and four departments numbered (1), (2), (3), and (4). Apart from personnel changes, this reorganization has reduced both the establishment and expenses. The number of surplus personnel reached over two hundred, accounting for more than half of the total number of former employees.</p>
<h3>The Youth Party's Participation in the Government Is Principally Determined; Dong Biwu Meets with Reporters to Explain the Communist Party's Position</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The issue of the Youth Party's participation in the government will be discussed and decided at the upcoming Central Executive Committee meeting. The party headquarters has become increasingly lively as representatives from various regions gather. Mr. Yu Jiaju, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the party, told reporters yesterday that the party's participation in the government has been determined in principle. This is because all parties and factions have an obligation to contribute to ending political tutelage and implementing constitutional government. However, the specific technical aspects of how to participate in the government are still under study. To put it plainly, the party hopes that its participation in the government will truly benefit the country and have a positive and beneficial effect on promoting constitutional government. Mr. Yu also said that the issue of participating in the government has only been mentioned in private conversations between government representatives and members of the party. No formal discussions have been held to date. He believes that one cannot be easily optimistic about the overall situation, but there is always a path to be found, and true peace will eventually be realized.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] In recent days, many government officials have traveled to Shanghai to engage with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party as they hold meetings in Shanghai. As a result, the political center of gravity has clearly shifted to Shanghai. After arriving in Nanjing, Zhang Zhizhong visited various people, including Wu Yuru today, and attended a dinner hosted by Ambassador Stuart in the evening, accompanied by Pi Zonggan and others. In addition, Liu Dongming and others from the Youth Party traveled to Shanghai by car tonight to discuss matters with party members who remained in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Communist Party representative Dong Biwu held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 5th to report on the Yellow River damming issue and to issue a written statement (full text in the second section), and answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Q: What is the new basis for peace talks?</p>
<p>A: The Communist Party still takes the dissolution of the National Assembly and the restoration of the military situation to the state of January 13th as the basis. Since the Communist Party put forward these two points, it has not yet received a definite reply from the government.</p>
<p>Q: Is Shao Lizi's visit related to the peace talks?</p>
<p>A: No, it's purely a New Year's greeting. I also returned the visit on the 3rd, but did not meet.</p>
<p>Q: Will General Zhang Zhizhong be visited after he arrives in Beijing?</p>
<p>A: I intend to pay my respects because during the Sheng Shicai era, more than one hundred Communist Party members were detained and released through Zhang's exchange, which is deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Q: The National Assembly has closed, and the peace talks have not reopened. What are your views on the new situation?</p>
<p>A: There is no hope for peace talks.</p>
<p>Q: Of the two conditions insisted upon by the Communist Party, the National Assembly has already convened. What is the Communist Party's view on this?</p>
<p>A: It can be regarded as a historical event.</p>
<p>Q: Do you recognize the new constitution?</p>
<p>A: No.</p>
<p>Q: How much does the basic spirit of the new constitution differ from the Political Consultative Conference's constitutional draft?</p>
<p>A: They are fundamentally incompatible.</p>
<p>Q: If Zhang Zhizhong raises the issue of peace talks during the visit, what will the Communist Party's response be?</p>
<p>A: It will depend on the situation.</p>
<p>Q: What is your opinion on the Bai Chongxi incident?</p>
<p>A: It's completely fabricated. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Visits Zhang Junmai to Discuss Reorganizing the Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Since arriving in Shanghai, Zhang Qun has been in frequent contact with people from various parties and factions to inquire about their opinions on reorganizing the government. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Zhang drove to Fan Garden to visit Zhang Junmai for a long talk of several hours. It is heard that they had a further discussion on the reorganization of the government and the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party in the government.</p>
<h3>Before Government Reorganization, Peace Talks Should Be Restored First</h3>
<p>CLA's Zhang Bojun Expresses His Views</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Zhang Bojun of the China Democratic League (CDL) told reporters yesterday: "The CDL believes that peace talks should be restored first, and then the government should be reorganized. If the government continues to reorganize in the manner of the National Assembly, without the full participation of all parties and factions, the situation will not be satisfactory. This opinion has been formally communicated to Mr. Lei Zhen and Mr. Zhang Qun. After a nationwide ceasefire and peace are realized, the CDL will definitely participate in the government. Before peace is achieved, if there is an objective need, the CDL will never give up its responsibility to mediate between the KMT and the CPC." Zhang continued: "In order to expand its organization and coordinate the opinions of its members, the preparatory meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the CDL decided that all members should join the League in their individual capacity, rather than participating in the name of groups. In this way, members of other organizations can also join and become members of the CDL. However, this method does not apply to members of the CCP, because the CCP has a particularly strong party spirit, and its members do not have the freedom to decide their opinions."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Second Plenary Session of the CDL is scheduled to formally open at 9:00 AM this morning. A total of thirty-six central committee members and representatives from local general branches will attend. Last night, the standing committee members of the League held a discussion meeting and decided that the location of the meeting would be kept strictly confidential. The opening ceremony will be presided over by Chairman Zhang Lan. After the election of the presidium, the central departments of the League will present reports, and the local general branches will present reports tomorrow. Proposals will be reviewed and issues discussed on a daily basis thereafter. The session will last for five days, and a declaration will be issued at the closing session, expressing the CDL's attitude towards the current situation.</p>
<h3>The Third Party Renames Itself</h3>
<p>To Be Called the Farmers and Workers Democratic Party</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Zhang Bojun, the leader of the Third Party, which participates in the China Democratic League, told reporters: The Third Party has decided to rename itself the "Farmers and Workers Democratic Party." This new name will be adopted at a national interim cadre meeting to be held in a week. After the cadre meeting, it is planned to set up party headquarters in all provinces of the country, focusing on farmers and workers, and launch activities.</p>
<h3>The Constitutional Government Promotion Association Can Be Established Within This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The list of candidates for the Preparatory Committee for the Promotion of Constitutional Government Implementation will be submitted for decision at the National Defense Committee meeting on the 6th. It is also heard that once the list of candidates is announced, preparations will be actively carried out, and the association should be established within this month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The National Assembly Representatives Association held its sixth executive committee meeting at 10:00 AM on the 4th in the National Assembly Hall. Thirty-four executive committee members, including Qu Xichen, attended. Wang Tongrong presided over the meeting, and it was resolved to recommend Wang Puhan, Du Guangxun, and eight others to consult with the government on the 6th to establish the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Chinese and English Texts of the Constitution Will Be Available Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Constitution of the Republic of China, which was formulated by the National Assembly, has been translated into English by Mr. Hao Zhixiang of the Central News Agency, and has been revised by experts and scholars. It has been published in the Shanghai Continental Report and the Free Forum. It is now planned to print a bilingual edition, and it will be available as soon as it is finalized.</p>
<h3>Zheng Dongguo Will Concurrently Serve as Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] Liang Huasheng, the chairman of Jilin Province, has been dismissed due to multiple complaints to the central government. It is heard that Liang will be subject to disciplinary action. The successor is rumored to be Zheng Dongguo.</p>
<h3>Compilation of the "National Assembly Records" Will Begin</h3>
<p>Work Scheduled to Be Completed Within Two Months</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The National Assembly will establish a National Assembly Records Compilation Committee to comprehensively collect relevant records, documents, reports, and commentaries, and systematically compile them into the "National Assembly Records" for reference. The successful process of this unprecedented undertaking will be preserved for posterity. This project has been approved by the Presidium of the Assembly, and the government has been requested to add a budget. The organization and selection of personnel for the committee will be determined by the Secretariat of the Assembly, and it is expected that all work will be completed within two months.</p>
<h3>The Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council Continues to Hold Review Meetings; Li Tang, Ling Hongxun, and Others Attend and Answer Questions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council held its fourth temporary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 5th to continue reviewing the national general budget. Shao Lizi, Qian Gonglai, Fu Sinian, and others attended. Li Tang, Minister of Finance, Ling Hongxun, Minister of Transportation, Jiang Wanping, Director of the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Transportation, Sun Zheng, Member of the Resources Committee, Zhang Junwen, Director of the Accounting Department, and Ji Shuno, Technical Expert, attended. First, Fan Yusui reported on the doubts that the second group of the review team still had about transportation, forestry, and the Resources Committee, and requested immediate answers. Ling Hongxun said: Among the state-owned enterprises, only the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway can barely maintain itself. All others require subsidies. It seems inappropriate to include the airline companies and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the budget. Zuo Shunsheng said: This budget is extremely incomplete. The income of the Highway Administration is estimated at ten million, while the expenditure is 2.5 billion, which is unreasonable. Li Tang said: This is an ordinary budget, not an operating budget, but there are also inconsistencies in the preparation. Yin Shuxian said: The problem is not whether the preparation is consistent or not, but whether it is coordinated or not. All agencies only have how much they spend, but not how much they earn. It is impossible to know their income and expenditure, and it is impossible to use income to make up for the budget deficit during the review. Jiang Wanping said: It should be coordinated, but there are still many technical difficulties in preparing an operating budget. Peng Gechen asked how much was not included in the budget, and why was it not included? Fan Yusui asked why the operating income budget was not included, so it becomes a private business, and there is no benefit to the state business. Gan Jiaqing said: The Savings and Remittance Bureau is not included. Is it considered a part of the national general budget? Jiang Wanping then explained why the operating budget of the Savings and Remittance Bureau was not included. Fan Yusui then pointed out that the peasant bank in the budget only has 500 million in income, and the Industrial Bank and the Commercial Bank only have 2 million. The actual numbers are definitely not this low. Dai Mingli replied: The peasant bank has very little interest, so the income is low. The Industrial Bank and the Commercial Bank are jointly operated by the government and private businesses. The profit is not known until the end of the year. Regarding why the China Tobacco Factory is included in the budget of the Ministry of Finance, it is because it was a factory jointly invested by the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing several years ago with 5,000 shares, and the government shares have not yet been fully repaid, so it must still be included in the budget of the Ministry of Finance. Someone asked if the Ministry of Finance has ever asked about the price of gold allocated by the four banks, and why is the financial market so chaotic? If it has the right to ask, then who holds this right? Dai Mingli replied: The income from the sale of gold is turned over to the national treasury, and the management is handled by the Joint Logistics Office and the Central Bank. The figures and income and expenditure will be reported by a dedicated person. The budget item of the Resources Committee was then raised as being "too simple," with an income of 30 billion and an expenditure of more than 200 billion, which is not realistic. Zhang Junwen said: 30 billion is the income from the group's operations, which is also the capital of the business. Someone suggested that if it doesn't make money, it's better to close it down. Zhang said: State-owned enterprises are not just for money. Then Qian Gonglai and others said that the Resources Committee cannot be closed. The meeting was adjourned immediately. The second review meeting continued in the afternoon, and it was decided that a plenary meeting would be held at 9:00 AM on the 6th, and all the review work would be completed.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Transportation Orders the China and Central Airlines to Suspend Flights for a Week; Another China Airlines Plane Crashes in Qingdao</h3>
<p>[News Report] A China Airlines flight number 121 from Shanghai to Beiping crashed 5 miles from Qingdao on the morning of the 5th. The cause of the accident is unknown. The plane was a large AC-16 type four-engine aircraft with a crew of five, led by American pilot Charles I Sharkey. There were a total of thirty-eight passengers, including three foreigners, two of whom were American Catholic nuns. In addition, there were three National Assembly representatives. It is reported that the wreckage of the crashed plane has been found, and all forty-three passengers and crew are said to have perished.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This Dispatch] According to sources from China Airlines and Central Airlines: Yesterday the weather was poor along the coast. All flights of China Airlines, except for the Beijing-Shanghai flight which arrived safely in Shanghai, have not arrived from Kunming, Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Beiping. The company telegraphed its offices in those locations yesterday to suspend flights to Shanghai, but it is not known whether they took off or landed mid-flight. All Central Airlines flights from Kunming to Shanghai, Hong Kong to Shanghai, Chongqing to Shanghai, and Beiping to Shanghai safely arrived in Shanghai yesterday, landing safely one after another. The landing was quite dangerous, but fortunately no accidents occurred.</p>
<p>[United Press, This City, 5th] A China Airlines plane crashed near the U.S. Marine Corps airfield in Qingdao today. The wreckage of the plane has been discovered by a U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane. According to China Airlines pilot Crook, the plane crashed on a horseshoe-shaped plain five miles from the airport. Recent news reports that rescue teams drove to the scene of the accident, but were unable to reach it because the area is controlled by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] When the Ministry of Transportation was investigating the causes of accidents and responsibilities of the two airlines due to the recent civil aviation accident in Shanghai, which resulted in multiple deaths and injuries, a China Airlines flight from Shanghai to Beiping crashed near Qingdao Airport on the morning of the 5th, and the plane and people were destroyed. The cause of the accident has not been determined. It is heard that the Ministry of Transportation attaches great importance to this, and in order to thoroughly investigate the responsibilities, it has ordered China Airlines and Central Airlines to suspend flights for a week before the cause of the accident is determined, and to thoroughly inspect all equipment to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Nine Passengers, All Blood and Flesh Indistinguishable</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 5th] China Airlines flight number 121, which flew from Shanghai to Qingdao this morning, flew over the city of Qingdao at 7:45 AM. Due to heavy fog, the CangKou Airport was unrecognizable and lost contact with the ground. It circled many times without being able to land. It crashed into a mountain near Licun (30 li away from Qingdao CangKou Airport) due to fog. The fuselage caught fire and burned, and all passengers were killed. The details are being investigated. After the crash, an aircraft was dispatched from here to investigate and was finally found near Licun, a suburb of Qingdao. Shen Shipan, director of the Qingdao Office of the company, went to the scene of the accident with the military police. He saw that the fuselage was completely destroyed, and the thirty-nine passengers, along with the pilot, were blood and flesh indistinguishable and the list was lost.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Sun Lianzhong left Beiping by special plane on the morning of the 5th to fly to Beijing to report on his work to the central government. He will return to Beiping in the near future. The situation in Hebei Province has recently been in a state of confrontation. In key areas such as the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, although the number of Communist troops is six to one compared to the National Army, the strength is relatively balanced. Although the Communist army has activities, it is difficult to achieve major gains except for the contention of small strongholds. The government is working hard to grasp the political grassroots and coordinate the effective cooperation of party, government, military, and youth organizations. Sun flew to Beijing after completing this plan.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Regarding the arrest of Lei Qilin, a National Assembly representative from Ningxia, Ma Hongkui, Chairman of Ningxia, recently sent a telegram to Councilors Wang Puhan, Gan Jiaxin, and Li Qia to explain. The original telegram is as follows: "Having read the newspaper reports that you are appealing for the Lei Qilin case and advocating that it be handled by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, etc., after investigation, Lei Qilin colluded with party members, incited the army, endangered the party and the country, and disrupted the local area. The case has accumulated like a mountain and has not been captured. Various groups have filed a complaint with the court for handling according to the law. As for the insult to personal matters, in this era of freedom of speech, one should examine oneself according to right and wrong, and listen to slander without answering.

(Signed) Ma Hongda, Prefectural Secretary, (January) Jiang (3rd) Seal."

<h3>Zhang Pingqun's Speech in the United States: Our Situation Shows Significant Progress, Presents Three Hopes to American Friends</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] Zhang Pingqun, our Consul General in New York, delivered a speech titled "Prospects for Peace in China" to 500 members of the Foreign Policy Association in Boston today. Zhang stated: The Chinese people sincerely hope that American friends can continue their economic cooperation. Harvard University Professor John King Fairbank and Michael Lindsay also expressed their opinions in their individual capacities. Zhang presented three hopes to American friends today: (1) American friends must understand the truth about the situation in China and the Chinese problem, because there are often differences between words and intentions, and propaganda is a specialty of the Communist Party. Therefore, such true understanding is especially necessary today. (2) We hope that the United States will cooperate in China's economic recovery, at least in undertakings that are not related to military affairs, because such undertakings clearly restore China's industrial development and improve the lives of ordinary people. (3) It is hoped that American friends can use their wisdom to distinguish the various statements made by those with prejudice. Zhang stated: The Communist Party problem in China has become much clearer than before, and he firmly believes that the hope for peace is also brighter than before, because the real situation in China has progressed. The Chinese government is still prepared to resolve the Communist Party problem through political means in order to achieve China's unification. If a political solution cannot be achieved, we will use other means to achieve unification. Zhang also discussed the pre-war construction achievements of our government, saying: Some American journalists have failed to inform the American people of the Chinese government's efforts in construction, which is truly unfortunate. Zhang cited as an example that in the years before the war, the central government implemented policies to teach farmers to use more advanced agricultural equipment and improve land utilization.</p>
<h3>Far East International Military Tribunal, Trial of Japanese War Criminals, Mei Ru'ao Talks to Reporters in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Dr. Mei Ru'ao, Judge of the Far East International Military Tribunal, returned to China from Japan the other day and arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the evening of the 4th. As the work of the Tokyo trial is becoming increasingly intense and is about to enter the defendant's defense phase, he will leave Nanjing next week and go to Shanghai to return to Japan. Mei's trip was a return to China taking advantage of the court's New Year holiday to report to our government authorities on the organization and recent situation of the Far East International Tribunal, and to collect the materials needed for the trial.</p>
<p>This reporter recently interviewed Mei at the Legislative Yuan and spoke freely about the trial situation of the Far East International Military Tribunal and his personal views on the trial of Japanese war criminals. The military tribunal is entirely international, composed of representatives from eleven countries. Because it specializes in trying Japanese top-level war criminals, the words "Far East" were added to the International Military Tribunal to distinguish it from the Nuremberg International Tribunal.</p>
<p>Entering the Defense Phase</p>
<p>Since the Tokyo International Tribunal officially began its trial on June 3 of last year, it has been seven months. The evidence provided by the prosecution, the indictment phase of the trial, has come to an end, and the defendant's defense phase will begin soon, which is expected to take four months. Finally, the stage of reviewing the evidence, sentencing, and execution is simpler, and will take about one to two months to complete. Therefore, the work of the International Tribunal is expected to be completed in May or June of this year. Mei stated: There were originally a total of 28 top-level Japanese war criminals tried by the court, but since Matsuoka Yosuke died of illness, and Okawa, due to mental illness, has not been tried since he assaulted Tojo at his first court appearance. Okawa's mental illness is said to be gradually improving, and he will definitely continue to be tried and sentenced in the future. Therefore, at the stage of indictment, there are always only 26 people present for trial, six of whom served as prime ministers, and the rest were cabinet ministers. Because the implications are extremely broad and the collection of evidence is quite complicated, the work is extremely busy. The prosecution has provided more than 2,000 pieces of evidence and documents, and the records are more than 16,000 pages long. About 100 witnesses have also been subpoenaed. The work will be even more intense when the debate begins in court in the future. During the indictment phase, the defendants only attended the hearings and did not speak. At this time, they will present the most favorable evidence and make full defenses. Each defendant has hired American and Japanese lawyers. If a defendant does not hire a lawyer himself, General MacArthur will definitely become the appointed defense lawyer. Currently, the 54 lawyers for the defendants are all extremely famous. On the Japanese side, most are law professors or presidents of law associations at Japanese Imperial Universities, and are the top-tier lawyers in Japan. It is expected that there will be a fierce debate at that time.</p>
<p>Reasons for Slow Progress</p>
<p>Mei explained in detail the reasons for the slow progress of the court's trial work. According to him: The main reasons are as follows: (1) The case is too complicated and involves too much. In terms of time, although it is stipulated that it starts from the "September 18th Incident" when Japan invaded China until the surrender in this war, the historical facts of the distant cause of the "September 18th Incident," the assassination of Zhang Zuolin in Huanggutun, have also been searched, traced, analyzed, and stated. In terms of space, it can be said that it stretches from the Songhua River to the South Seas Islands, involving many countries. Therefore, the evidence presented is numerous and complex, and processing it is time-consuming and requires time. (2) Language relations: In addition to using English, because the language of the defendant must be used at the same time according to law, both English and Japanese are usually used. The translation, interpretation, and proofreading are most time-consuming. Even some foreign witnesses require several translations. For example, Yi Zhizhi testified for eight days, but actually only spoke for two days. The rest of the time was spent on translation. The situation of Vice Minister Qin Dechun's testimony was also the same. He attended the court for five days, but only needed to speak for one day. (3) The Anglo-American litigation procedure is thorough and pays the most attention to concrete and sufficient evidence. This is fully provided by the eleven countries, so there are as many as 2,000 pieces, and the records of more than 16,000 pages are far more than the Nuremberg International Tribunal. (4) Institutional relations: Adopting opposition interrogation, also known as "cross-examination," is not available in China and other continental countries. Under this system, the defendant's lawyers can interrogate the witnesses and ask questions that are most favorable to the defendant. The defendant's lawyers can refute the testimony reasonably and cite facts and attack. They can also question the credibility and personality of the witness and attack them to reduce the witness's identity, qualifications, and strength, and indirectly increase the defendant's favorable position. For example, asking the witness whether he has committed a crime, whether he has a mental illness, whether he has had venereal diseases, etc. The 54 defendants' lawyers try their best to attack the weaknesses of the witnesses, which is also the reason for the slow progress. (5) In some areas among the eleven prosecuting countries, the viewpoints on jurisprudence are not unified, and conflicts or repetitions inevitably occur, which makes the work progress even more slowly.</p>
<p>Presenting Two Concepts</p>
<p>Finally, Mei presented two points of view on the work of the Tokyo International Tribunal: First, President Truman once declared: The Nuremberg trial of war criminals was one of the greatest events of the Second World War, and the Americans listed the Nuremberg trial of war criminals as one of the major events of 1946, but the Tokyo Tribunal is also in the same important position, consuming a lot of manpower, material resources, and intelligence, and using various new scientific equipment, such as printing, translation, photography, etc. Its main purpose is definitely not just the life and death of 26 Japanese war criminals, but to establish or consolidate the principles of international law, to make the already unclear principles of international law clearer, and to further promote them. The main principle is that "aggressive war is a crime." Second, anyone who participates in the war is also a criminal, regardless of planning, execution, conspiracy, or promotion of national superior culture, inciting aggressive war, etc. In addition to the legal responsibility of the country, individuals should also be guilty. After the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of the Second World War, individual actions that affect the international peace order must also be subject to legal sanctions. Here, we have obtained a definite conclusion.</p>

<h3>Resident Autonomy Trial in Various Districts of Hong Kong's New Territories</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th Special Dispatch] The Hong Kong government is piloting resident autonomy in various districts of the New Territories. It has already been implemented on Tai O Island. General elections were held in the Cheung Chau district on the 3rd, with the Deputy District Officer of the New Territories, Aitcheson, supervising the election. The meeting place followed our country's assembly methods. The national flag and the Prime Minister's portrait were hung in the auditorium. First, each neighborhood selected 100 candidates in proportion to the population, who were also members of the small group. Then, seven people were selected to form a residents' association. If residents have any problems, they will first be submitted to the small group members, and then to the residents' association for resolution. This autonomy will continue to be held in various places.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Hong Kong government has formulated a five-year plan for the New Territories, which focuses on increasing production and reducing dependence on external assistance.

<h3>Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Pingjin Area Total Over Two Trillion Yuan, Sun Yueqi Discusses Handling Process</h3>
<p>[This City News] Sun Yueqi, director of the Pingjin Area Enemy and Puppet Industries Handling Bureau, recently went to Beijing from Pingjin on official business and came to Shanghai along the way. Yesterday, he met with a Central News Agency reporter at his residence in Shanghai and briefly described the bureau's handling of enemy and puppet industries over the past year as follows: The bureau was established in Pingjin in December of the year before last and successively established offices in Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, and Taiyuan. Although the entire enemy and puppet industry in the above-mentioned places has not yet reached the final settlement period, according to current estimates, its total value can exceed at least two trillion yuan or more, most of which are real estate, such as factories, mines, and real estate. The amount processed and delivered to the national treasury is approximately 240 billion yuan, most of which is gold and silver, worth approximately 90 billion yuan. The rest is houses, factories, and daily necessities. Among them, daily necessities account for the largest proportion of income. There are more than 100 factories, and various methods such as material valuation, consignment notes, bidding, and auctions are used. Factories and houses are all sold by bidding. If they have not been successfully bid out twice, the method of negotiated purchase is used to resolve the issue. In addition, the handling of factory and real estate disputes, which have been returned to the original owners, has been completed in more than 3,000 cases. This work can be considered to have come to an end. Furthermore, production industries, such as Tianjin Huaxin and other seven yarn factories, have been allocated to the China Textile Construction Company, which owns 300,000 spindles in total. In addition, Kai, which produces 12,000 tons of coal per day, and Jingxing, which produces 2,000 tons of coal per day, have also been allocated to the National Resources Commission and the Hebei Provincial Government for joint management. The Jibei Power Plant, which uses high-voltage lines to connect Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan and generates more than 13,000 degrees of electricity, has been repaired and will soon be fully operational. The North China Iron and Steel Plant, which can produce more than 8,000 tons of steel per day, has also been allocated to the National Resources Commission. Sun estimated that the general closing date of the bureau's branches would be around June of this year, and the reason for the delay was that the handling procedures in the local offices were more difficult.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 5th] The handling of enemy properties in Pingjin has not been completed, and the Handling Bureau will not be closed down for the time being. According to the person in charge of the bureau: The bureau's business scope includes not only Beiping, but also Taiyuan and Zhangjiakou, etc. The scope of Tianjin is wider than that of Shanghai, and the handling of affairs is also more complicated than that of Shanghai. Because the Shanghai Bureau was established earlier than the Beiping Bureau, the handling aspect is also simpler. It has been mostly completed in one year. The Pingjin District Bureau has only handled three-quarters in one year. Except for the traitor properties, which have not been handled in one case due to their connection with judicial procedures, the remaining enemy and puppet materials have been sold in stages and have reached the eighth stage. Based on the situation in Pingjin, it is feared that it will not be able to close down at present. According to the handling deadline, it will take another half a year to complete the bidding and purchasing of scattered materials and small factories. Director Sun Yueqi also went to Beijing to ask for instructions on whether the Pingjin District Bureau should extend the deadline.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Damming and Restoration Problems, Dong Biwu Issues Statement, Requests Government to Allocate Funds Quickly</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Communist Party representative Dong Biwu held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 5th and issued a written statement on the Yellow River damming problem. The main points are as follows: "The damming and restoration of the Yellow River must be carried out in coordination. The two major and arduous tasks of downstream dike restoration and relocation and relief of riverside residents cannot be completed in a few months; however, since the Shanghai Agreement in July, the government authorities have (1) delayed in allocating funds, and the 'Liberated Area' has advanced 4.9 billion for the initial dike restoration project, and the second phase of project funds has not been paid at all; (2) the Shanghai Agreement promised to allocate 15 billion yuan for the relief of riverbed residents from August to December last year, which has been delayed and unpaid; (3) destroying the project and attacking the 'Liberated Area'. Finally, according to reports, the Huayuankou began to release water on December 27 last year, flooding downstream residents. Huang Biwu, chairman of the 'Liberated Area' Relief Committee, made a serious protest to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Executive Headquarters (ExHq), and the Water Conservancy Commission, and put forward five suggestions: (1) immediately stop the damming and water release work and investigate the responsibility for the water release; (2) the damming of the Huayuankou must be delayed until five months later, otherwise the government will be responsible for the consequences; (3) the 15 billion yuan for the relief of riverbed residents must be paid quickly; (4) the dike restoration funds should be distributed fairly and reasonably according to the length of the dike line and the size of the project; (5) the materials and equipment provided by UNRRA to assist us in controlling the Yellow River should be delivered directly to the 'Liberated Area'." This letter has been sent separately, but there has been no reply.</p>
<p>[This City News] Wu Yunfu, the central government's representative stationed at ExHq, held a press conference at Zhou Enlai's residence on Sinan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the current situation of the Yellow River damming project. Wu also issued a letter from CPC representative Dong Biwu to ExHq, the content of which can be divided into: (1) The CPC has not made preparations for the Yellow River damming work, and the problem of restoring the Yellow River to its old course is that there are many residents in the area. If relocation is to be handled, the expenses will be huge. Therefore, the project to restore the Yellow River to its old course is extremely difficult; (2) The government previously promised to allocate 150 billion yuan for the Yellow River control project, but has not allocated a penny to date. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will quickly allocate this amount to facilitate the project.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Municipal Administration in the Year of Democratic Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>The second Shanghai Municipal Assembly is set to open today. The convocation of this assembly of popular will coincides with the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, marking the beginning of the so-called year of democratic constitutionalism. Its profound significance is self-evident. Although the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly predates the Constitution's promulgation, the election of municipal assembly members, the establishment of the Municipal Assembly, and its past achievements have fully demonstrated the spirit of democratic constitutionalism. The convocation of this second assembly comes at the heels of the completion of the constitutional project. Upholding the spirit of constitution-making and the Constitution itself, it will undoubtedly set a precedent for democratic constitutionalism. The normal course of constitutionalism is that the people have rights, and the government has competence. While the Municipal Assembly is a form of local autonomy, it is inextricably linked to the rise and fall of national constitutionalism. The soundness of national politics is founded on the soundness of local politics. Britain, despite lacking a written constitution, serves as a model of modern constitutionalism. Although the factors involved are complex, the soundness of local politics is a major key. The development of modern British constitutionalism is built on the foundation of sound local politics. This stands in stark contrast to the development in continental Europe, especially France. Now, the convocation of the second Shanghai Municipal Assembly coincides with the beginning of our year of democratic constitutionalism. It is hoped that the convocation of this Municipal Assembly will lead to a sounder municipal administration in Shanghai.</p>
<p>To ensure the soundness of municipal administration, the assembly representing the will of the citizens must be able to exert its effectiveness. This requires the Municipal Assembly itself to make good use of its powers, and the municipal authorities, in particular, must conscientiously abide by the spirit of the Assembly's resolutions and implement them effectively. Under a democratic government, the people are the masters, and the government must govern in accordance with the people's will. The Municipal Assembly, composed of representatives elected by the citizens, is in effect the highest authority in the city. All municipal facilities should be subject to the decisions of the Assembly. Even if the municipal authorities are not directly subordinate to the Assembly, they are merely agencies for executing policy decisions. In the past, the "Shanghai Municipal Council" of the Public Concession was a representative body elected by taxpayers, and all the municipal affairs of the "Public Concession" were decided by this representative body and implemented by directly subordinate departments. Now, we have the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Assembly, a body representing public opinion. In addition to handling cases assigned by the central government, the Shanghai Municipal Government should be subject to the Municipal Assembly on all municipal facilities. Now that we are at the beginning of the year of democratic constitutionalism, and Shanghai is the premier city in the country, the Municipal Assembly should actively exert its effectiveness in promoting Shanghai's municipal administration in the future. If someone says, "The Municipal Government is the big boss, and the Assembly is the boss," that is undemocratic. If we can use old titles to express our meaning, then the Municipal Assembly should be the "big boss," and the Municipal Government is just the "bosses'" errand boy.</p>
<p>Speaking of Shanghai's municipal administration, there are truly a thousand threads and myriad things waiting to be done. Today, the rugged and uneven roads of Shanghai are a reflection of the city's myriad problems. The sole task of the current Shanghai Municipal Assembly is to revive municipal administration. In order to revive municipal administration, there must be large expenditures. Therefore, the main task of this convocation of the Municipal Assembly is to review the budget submitted by the Municipal Government. The size of the figures is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai's municipal development, and even compared with the budget of the capital, Nanjing, it is astounding. It is well known that government finances do not follow the principle of private finance of living within one's means; however, government finances cannot ignore the people's ability to bear the burden, and should not neglect the cultivation of tax sources. According to newspaper reports, the budget submitted by the Municipal Government totals 230 billion yuan, of which 123.1 billion yuan are covered by regular income, and 86.9 billion yuan, accounting for one-third of the total budget, must rely on temporary income to supplement it. In today's declining industry and commerce, we hope that the Municipal Assembly will carefully consider the submission of this huge budget. Those involving necessary municipal construction should be maintained, while those used to maintain redundant agencies and retain redundant personnel should be deleted. Although Shanghai is the premier city in the country, there are existing laws to follow regarding the organization of municipal administration. Those agencies and personnel who do not follow the regulations should be eliminated to save public funds.</p>
<p>As for how to rectify tax collection in order to enrich the treasury, the municipal financial authorities should certainly have a comprehensive plan, and the Municipal Assembly should carefully consider it. At present, the tax burden borne by the citizens of Shanghai is often overwhelming. If there are any new tax increases that affect the lives of the general public, it will inevitably provoke resentment among the general public. At a time of democratic withering, the increase of new taxes should be approached with great caution. Rather than thinking about increasing new taxes, how to increase the municipal treasury should actively rectify existing tax collection. Whether there are abuses in the collection of taxes and whether it can be improved are all worth considering. In the collection of taxes, the duplication of tax burdens should be avoided. In the past, the collection of municipal construction surcharges was added to property taxes, water bills, electricity bills, telephone bills, and gas bills. There were surcharges everywhere. A citizen may have to pay five or six construction surcharges of the same name every month, resulting in surcharges and taxes everywhere. This is the culmination of tax duplication and indicates a pathological tax system. The fact that taxes have the name of construction, but where the construction is, is particularly perplexing to the general public. Shanghai's municipal finances should have a way; we should not only think about increasing the burden on the people.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the various issues of municipal administration that should be implemented and reformed, the mayor has already submitted important cases. The assembly members come from the people and know the hardships of the people. Presumably, they will also submit proposals. Due to the convocation of this Assembly, we not only hope that they will set an example for local autonomy in China, but also set a precedent for democratic constitutionalism in China in the future. How to actively exert the effectiveness of the Municipal Assembly, the convocation of this Assembly will surely have the facts to comfort the hopes of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Control Advisory Group Inspects Huayuankou</h3>

<h3>New Great Wall Beyond the Frontier: Record of a Meeting with General Fu Zuoyi (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>Holding a Golden Rice Bowl and Begging for Food. General Fu believes that the current situation in Chahar Province is no different from "holding a golden rice bowl and begging for food." He said: Japan did some construction work in Chahar Province, but mainly to build Chahar Province into a colony and extract raw materials. The Japanese built 58 factories in Chahar and left some survey materials. Most of the factories and mines have now been destroyed by the Communist army, especially in Zhangjiakou. The destruction caused by the Communist army in one and a half days is simply not something that can be restored in three to five months. All we got are broken houses and rotten machines. When he mentioned these people, Fu just shook his head and said repeatedly, "It's really a big headache!"</p>
<p>General Fu said in a rather proud tone: Chahar Province's iron ore reserves are the second richest in the country, second only to Liaoning. The Xuanhua coal and iron mine has astonishing reserves and modern iron smelting equipment. It is expected to be repaired in two or three months, and then the ore will be transported to the vicinity of Beiping for smelting. In addition, Chahar Province also has some rare minerals such as mica.</p>
<p>In terms of agricultural products, Chahar Province's millet and wheat are also very famous. Several shipments are transported to Pingjin and other places via the Ping-Sui Railway every day. It is just that there is a lack of good power equipment, and the entire province is in a state of hardship. Therefore, even on the table where Chief Fu invited the press corps to dinner, the steamed buns and rolls were not made of the best white flour. The general himself and several department chiefs at the scene ate one after another, making reporters from Beijing and Shanghai embarrassed not to follow suit.</p>
<p>Currently, the biggest lack in Chahar Province is electricity. In Zhangjiakou alone, there are many, many businesses that cannot be rebuilt because of insufficient electricity. General Fu told us that the Japanese originally had a 65,000-kilowatt power generation plan in Chahar Province, and 40,000 kilowatts had been completed before its unconditional surrender, but currently less than 1,000 kilowatts are in operation, and everything has of course come to a standstill. The provincial government has cooperated with the National Resources Commission to find ways to restore the power plant in Xiahuayuan. It is expected that it will increase to 10,000 kilowatts in the near future, which will be of great benefit to the paralyzed industry.</p>
<p>Most of the Roads Have Been Repaired</p>
<p>Another task being carried out under the leadership of General Fu is the restoration of transportation. The railways from Zhangjiakou to Beiping and from Zhangjiakou to Datong have been repaired recently. The reconstruction of this major artery has indeed brought some American cigarettes and the like to the market, but materials from Shanxi and Chahar Provinces have been able to be transported out in a steady stream, and goods from Hebei and Tianjin have also been transported in continuously. In terms of highways, most of the roads in the province have been hastily repaired. There is a very good highway from Zhangjiakou to Zhangbei to Kulun. The road from Zhangjiakou to Chongli is very bumpy, but this also shows the extent of the destruction before it was repaired. It is said that when Zhangjiakou was first recovered, a ten-wheeled truck came from a nearby hole, and after traveling for dozens of days, only five of the ten wheels were left, and it continued to travel. At that time, the road was full of landmines and potholes everywhere, but now the road from the chief's office to the airfield is probably smoother than the section from Nanjing to Qixia Mountain and from Huxi to Hongqiao Road in Shanghai. This is something that we in the Beijing-Shanghai area should be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Chief Fu did this without collecting a single tax in Chahar Province and without conscripting a single soldier in Chahar Province. What is it for? In his own words, it is to "ensure that every ordinary person has food to eat." Achieving this goal is certainly not a matter of days, but this approach is always commendable.</p>
<p>The People Are His Strength</p>
<p>The hard work and struggle of General Fu and his staff in Chahar Province is something that people in Beijing and Shanghai cannot imagine. When the reporter was in Zhangjiakou, he asked him, "There are so many things to do in Chahar Province, how are the funds raised? I heard that your province is very short of talent. May I ask what plans you have for attracting and training talent?" Fu smiled wryly after hearing this, rubbed his hands together, and said in a deep voice: "There is no money at all for developing Chahar, not a single penny. We have already drafted a plan for attracting talent."</p>
<p>Yes, Chahar is incredibly poor (referring to above ground), but the provincial government's construction plans are still underway. What are they relying on as their backing? In another conversation, General Fu gave us the answer: He relies on the people. He told us in a storytelling tone how the workers in Zhangjiakou are now working hard and how they cherish their factories. He said: "The past destruction has increased the workers' work enthusiasm. The other side's behavior has strengthened the workers' love for the factory, because they did not know the value of the factory until there was no factory. The Zhangjiakou Broadcasting Station once had workers who sacrificed their lives to protect the machinery."</p>
<p>Fu told the reporter: The National Army was the first to be stationed in Zhangjiakou, and in this not-so-short period, there was not a single robbery in Zhangjiakou, and not even a few minor disputes occurred. This proves how much the people support the government.</p>
<p>Only a government that loves the people and cares for their welfare can truly get the help of the people. When reporting his thoughts on the Chongli incident, Fu finally mentioned, "Today, the Chinese people are in too much pain, and the common people are living inhuman lives. We should quickly help them solve their difficulties." This compassionate heart has already had an effect.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou is not only the capital of Chahar, but also the border defense center of the country. The safety of the area affects not only the entire North China, but also the safety of the entire China. In addition to the natural barriers such as the Great Wall, there must be a new Great Wall built with the strength of the people guarding that important border town, and the strongest of these iron walls is General Fu Zuoyi, "every inch of whom has the temperament of the common people." —Recorded in the capital on January 4</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Sets Implementation Measures to Consolidate Tax Registers in the Pacification Zone, Severe Punishment for Fraud and Concealment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang] The Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that the counties in the province's Pacification Zone have been devastated and destroyed for a long time, and all the land tax registers have been scattered and lost, has specially formulated the Jiangsu Province Pacification Zone Tax Register Consolidation Implementation Measures to complete the consolidation within six months. The details of these measures are as follows: (1) The consolidation of tax registers in the Pacification Zone of this province, except for areas that retain land tax registers and are handled in accordance with the 35-year edition of the Jiangsu Province Sunan counties consolidation tax register measures, shall be handled in accordance with these measures. (2) The tax register consolidation business in the Pacification Zone of this province shall be supervised by the Land and Food Section or the Land Tax and Food Administration Office of each county (city) government, supervising the township and town chiefs, and no separate office shall be established. (3) Each county (city) government shall dispatch appropriate personnel to supervise different areas. (4) The procedures for tax register consolidation are as follows: one, on-site investigation; two, owner reporting; three, public announcement; four, ordering the old grain books to be checked; five, determining the grades and calculating the tax amount; six, compiling the tax register. (5) Tax register consolidation shall be based on townships and towns. Each township and town shall be divided into several sections according to the existing village boundaries and natural terrain. The township and town chiefs shall supervise the village chiefs to investigate the location of the land, mu, household name, address, user name, address, land price, income, grain amount, and other items, and list the land numbers starting and ending with the section. (6) After completing the investigation of each section of land, each village shall immediately notify the owners to submit deeds, grain strings, and certificates. The serial number shall be stamped or fingerprinted on the investigation form. A processing fee of 200 yuan shall be charged for each investigation form. (7) After completing the owner reporting procedures, the investigation forms shall be prepared in sections and listed at the offices of each village for public announcement. After a month, the township and town chiefs shall submit them to the county government. In case of disputes or conflicts during the public announcement period, they shall mediate or order them to go to court for legal processing. (8) The tax amount of each county (city) shall still be based on the total amount of land tax in each county (city). Counties (cities) with too many land grades may be appropriately merged into three grades and nine grades. (9) After the investigation forms of each township and town are collected, they shall be sorted and statistically analyzed. If there are excesses in the original total area or the original tax rate of each grade, they may be appropriately reduced. If there are deficiencies in the original total area or the original tax rate of each grade, they may be appropriately increased. A meeting of township and town chiefs shall be convened to decide and submit to the county assembly for review before submitting to the province for approval. (10) After the grade tax rate is determined, the investigation forms shall be compiled into household registers (household receipt registers) by household, using the township as the unit. After the tax register is compiled, the investigation forms shall be restored to their original state and bound into a book (village receipt household register). (11) Before consolidating the tax register, each county (city) shall convene village chiefs and local gentry groups to expand publicity so that the meaning of tax register consolidation is known to every household and the implementation is smooth. (12) Any personnel who violate the law or commit fraud in handling tax register consolidation in each county (city) shall be severely punished according to law. Any owner who conceals land without reporting it or who reports the area or grade incorrectly shall be severely punished.</p>

<h3>City Conditions in Hangzhou at the End of the Year Grow Increasingly Bleak, But It is Hoped That They Can Barely Weather the Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 5th] As the Lunar New Year approaches, the decline of industry and commerce in Hangzhou is becoming increasingly severe. The purchasing power of the citizens is weak, and even the business of street vendors is sluggish, with daily sales of only over ten thousand yuan. The request for a 20 billion yuan loan for the end of the year, which was made by the business community to the Provincial Government, has not materialized. Most merchants are worried and distressed. However, according to financial figures, although Hangzhou's business community is quite strapped for cash at the end of the year, it is not expected to collapse as a result. Except for tea merchants, who have experienced many bankruptcies due to the impact on their business, most stores are still managing to barely weather the end of the year.</p>
<h3>A Young Man from Shanghai Commits Suicide in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Suzhou] Li Houming, an employee of the Yonghe Industrial Materials Company at No. 1988 Nanjing West Road in Shanghai, came to Suzhou from Shanghai on Lunar New Year's Eve and rented Room 103 at the Suzhou Inn. He went out to play every day, leaving early and returning late, without any unusual behavior. However, after returning to his room at around 7:00 PM on the 3rd, he immediately locked the door. Half an hour later, the waiter on duty heard vomiting sounds from inside the room and hurriedly knocked on the door. He entered the room and saw Li lying on the bed, his face pale, tossing and turning, and in great pain. Realizing that he had taken poison, he immediately hired a car to take him to Bo Xiong Hospital for emergency treatment. However, due to the onset of the poison, he died at 9:05 PM. He left three suicide notes, one addressed to his family at No. 130, Lane 741, Chengdu Road, Shanghai, one addressed to his brother-in-law, Xu Meng, at No. 57, Yuanchang Lane, Yuanchang Road, Shanghai, and one addressed to his two colleagues, Ye Sen and Gong Quan, at his workplace. The general gist of the letters was that he was under economic pressure and expressed much remorse, stating that it was caused by economic pressure. It is said that the poison he took was potassium cyanide, and he took an entire bottle. This drug is extremely poisonous and could not be treated. The inn is now trying to notify his family in Shanghai to come to Suzhou to collect the body.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Investigation Begins for Winter Relief in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Jiaxing] This county has organized a committee to conduct winter relief, dividing it into groups and proceeding with accumulation. The 6 million yuan in winter relief funds raised locally is largely sufficient. A preliminary investigation of the poor has begun, and once the compilation is complete, a meeting will be held to discuss the loan disbursement methods.

<h3>Anhui Province Senator Request Strict Investigation of Corruption in Grain Purchasing</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Liu'an] Previously, there was corruption in the entrusted purchase of military grain in Sanhe in this county. After discussion, the County Council decided to send a letter to the County Government or the Judiciary Department to detain Cai Weiming, Pan Boyan, Cheng Yongshen, and other people involved in the corruption and recover the embezzled funds. However, many days have passed, and Cai Weiming and others are still at large. Now, County Councilors Shen Yaoting, Jiang Songya, Zhang Shouxian, and Chuan Yueqiao have jointly sent a letter to the County Council requesting a strict investigation. They pointed out that at the time of the entrusted purchase of grain in Sanhe, two jin of loss were added per hundred jin in advance, which was sufficient for wind erosion. However, Pan Boyan, Cheng Yongshen, and other warehouse keepers of the fourth and fifth warehouses arbitrarily borrowed and spent the grain, falsely claiming that the loss was as high as 240,000 jin, which was adding loss on top of loss. In addition, after investigating warehouses one, two, and three, there was still a surplus of over 10,000 jin of the same quality of rice delivered at the same time. Why was there such a surplus in one case and such a huge loss in another? The corruption is obvious. In addition, the section chief, Cai Zaming, privately sold over 76 shi of spoiled rice from the Sujiabu warehouse and the rice from Sanhe, and he also arbitrarily lent a lot of rice to private individuals and militias. All of this has been verified by the Entrusted Grain Purchase Liquidation Committee. It is also said that there are other unknown amounts that are difficult to ascertain for the time being.</p>

<p>Thoughts on Aviation Safety Inspired by the Plane Crash</p>
<p>Although the cause of this unprecedented aviation disaster was due to sudden changes in the weather, the pilot's skills and the equipment of the aircraft and airfield may also be factors contributing to the disaster. Assuming that all humanly possible things were perfected, it is not known whether this disaster could have been avoided.</p>
<p>After it has already happened, one can imagine how much consolation and compensation can actually benefit the victims and their families. The same is true for ships. The shipping industry should be deeply vigilant and not focus solely on profit-making while neglecting the seaworthiness of ships. If an unfortunate incident occurs, the loss of cargo can be easily recovered, but the loss of lives and the loss to the families of the victims can never be compensated by money. Moreover, the casualty rate of shipwrecks is greater than that of airplanes. Recalling the past, one shipwreck resulted in hundreds of lives lost. Thinking back on past events, one cannot help but shudder. Today's operators are only seeking to save costs when repairing ships and rushing the schedule, paying little attention to safety equipment. The competent authorities are also very lax in their inspections. All of these are factors that can lead to disasters. The most dangerous thing is the number of passengers exceeding the prescribed limit and the cargo exceeding the load line. As for the technical skills of the crew, as far as the current situation is concerned, senior personnel such as the captain and chief engineer have proven their performance since the victory and return to duty. However, second-level crew members have not fully met the standards, which is the most worrying thing at present. The crew members themselves should strive to improve, and companies with sufficient funds should spend it on training second-level personnel rather than training other personnel, and regarding the safety equipment of each ship, make as many additions as possible. Whether a ship is sailing or anchored, it cannot rely solely on the captain's superior technical experience. The responsibility of the second and third mates is also important. As for navigation safety equipment, our country is also a signatory to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and cannot ignore its responsibilities and obligations. Based on the above, what is expected of all parties can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) Shipping companies should not focus solely on profit-making and neglect all necessary equipment, such as compasses, sounding devices, anchor chains, wireless telegraphs, astronomical instruments, fire extinguishers, and life-saving equipment. They should all be fully equipped and usable, and any damage should be replaced immediately to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. (2) The competent authorities should be strict in inspecting ships and examining crew members, and must strictly prohibit passengers and cargo from exceeding the limit before departure, especially for small ships sailing in coastal waters. Special attention must be paid to this. It is all clearly stipulated in writing, but it depends on whether it can be enforced. (3) When troops board a ship, senior officers should pay attention to the number of people the ship can accommodate, and the location of loading and unloading military equipment and ammunition, as well as cooking on the ship, must be carefully selected. After boarding, the route and location of stops should be followed in accordance with the captain's instructions. (4) If passengers encounter a shipwreck, they should remain calm and follow the captain's instructions. They must not run around in a panic.</p>
<p>If all parties can cooperate and the crew strictly adhere to discipline, always focusing on "safety first" and being as cautious as walking on thin ice at all times, then disasters that can be avoided by human effort can be avoided, and even if they cannot be avoided, losses can be reduced. Conversely, what is called a natural disaster is actually man-made. Prevention should be taken before it happens. I dare to say a word to those involved in transportation. (Chen Tianjun)</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Shen Wenjia of Jiaxing</p>
<p>Regarding the matter raised in your letter about the improper handling of a passenger injured by a gunshot wound by the Jiaxing station staff, after forwarding it to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, we have now received a letter from the Transportation Department of the administration stating: "After a telegram was sent to the Jiaxing stationmaster for a reply, it was stated: 'On the afternoon of July 16th of this year, at around 4:00 PM, a passenger named Shao Wenhan was found sleeping on a rattan couch, accompanied by his family and Dr. Chen Jiaxuan of Fuyin Hospital, and brought to the station. It was said that he had accidentally injured his abdomen while playing with a handgun in the morning and intended to take the Xihu train to Shanghai for medical treatment. I observed at the time that the passenger's injury was very serious. According to the railway regulations, passengers with serious illnesses that may cause death or infectious diseases are not allowed to board the train. However, in order to save lives, I immediately agreed. However, according to the doctor, the injured passenger could not move or walk and had to be carried into the carriage along with the rattan couch. I kindly explained that the interior of the Xihu train was narrow and it would be difficult to place the rattan couch. The door was small, making it impossible to carry it in. It could only be changed to the next train, No. 62, and I would arrange for the rattan couch to be placed in the luggage car. The time would only be delayed by two hours. At the same time, I asked the doctor whether the injured passenger's condition would worsen due to the vibration of the train or whether there would be a risk of death along the way, and whether the doctor would escort him to Shanghai to provide emergency treatment? The doctor replied: It is difficult to predict at this time, and I am unable to escort him due to important matters and he will be accompanied by family. Seeing that the doctor was unwilling to take responsibility, and because I am ignorant of medicine, if the passenger died along the way, who would be responsible? Therefore, I immediately telegraphed Dr. Xue Zhaoji and Dr. Tang Renjing of the Jiaxing Clinic to come to the station for diagnosis. According to the opinion of the two doctors, the bullet hit the abdomen and did not penetrate. The injury was not minor, and it was difficult to determine whether there would be any danger along the way after two or three hours of train vibration. Therefore, the family consulted with Dr. Chen and decided to discontinue the trip to Shanghai and instead send him to the Jiaxing Zhejiang Provincial Hospital for treatment. Based on the above facts, the failure to board the Xihu train was actually limited by the fact that the passenger could not move and had to be carried in with the rattan couch. As for the Xihu train not being able to accommodate the huge rattan couch and the door not being able to carry it in, these are definite facts. I did not refuse him and agreed to let him take train No. 62 to Shanghai, which can also be said to have fulfilled my duty to assist. The passenger came to the station accompanied by Dr. Chen, and Dr. Xue and Dr. Tang were only a stone's throw away from the station. How can it be said that there was a deliberate attempt to make things difficult by repeatedly requesting proof? Since he was determined to go to Shanghai for medical treatment, he could have changed to train No. 62. The temporary decision to send him to the Provincial Hospital proves that his injury was dangerous and he voluntarily gave up his claim to take the train. What does this have to do with my station? As for the assertion that sending him to Shanghai would definitely save him, while staying in Jiaxing would definitely lead to death, the doctor was unable to guarantee it at the time. It is even more absurd to accuse others with unsubstantiated claims. Moreover, this matter has been over five months ago. If I had acted improperly or deliberately made things difficult at the time, the family could have filed a complaint earlier. Why wait until today to make a pointless submission? This shows that someone else has fabricated facts and deliberately defamed me. In short, this matter has been certified by the two doctors, Xue and Tang, and the true cause of death can be verified by the Provincial Hospital. Empty words cannot be used to convict people.' After reviewing the statement, there is nothing inconsistent. Please examine and act accordingly." Respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3>Vandenberg Elected Speaker of the US Senate; Republican Party Regains Control; Biddle Case Reaches Bipartisan Compromise, Breaking Deadlock; Truman to Deliver State of the Union Address Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The Senate today elected Republican Senator Vandenberg of Michigan as Speaker and notified President Truman to prepare for parliamentary business. It then adjourned until next Monday for a joint session with the House of Representatives to hear President Truman's State of the Union Address.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] After two days of wrangling over the issue of barring Mississippi Democratic Senator Bilbo from attending, the U.S. Senate sought to break the deadlock and proceed with its proceedings. A compromise has now been reached. According to reporters, Bilbo and leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties have welcomed a compromise solution in which Bilbo will receive pay but not be sworn in or take office pending the outcome of the investigation. Bilbo was elected as a third-term senator last year and is being investigated for allegedly preventing black people from voting and using his position to seek personal gain in wartime construction projects. This compromise solution will allow the other thirty-five senators to be sworn in, and the Republican Party can officially take control of the Senate. President Truman will also be able to deliver his address to a joint session of Congress next Monday as planned.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] The focus of the first post-war meeting of the U.S. Congress will be on domestic issues rather than international affairs.

<p>American Liberal Representatives Form New Political Organization</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] One hundred and fifty representatives of American "liberals" tonight initiated the formation of the "Democratic Action Alliance." It was announced that Communists and their colleagues are not allowed to join. The organization's purpose is to follow the teachings of great democratic figures such as Washington, Lincoln, Wilson, and Roosevelt and uphold six basic principles. Franklin Roosevelt Jr., former Price Administrator Henderson, radio commentator Davis, and United Auto Workers President Luther have been designated as organizers to form an organizing committee. This new political group is sponsored by the original "Democratic Action Union," which invited representatives to attend the meeting, which led to the decision to form the new association. Its founding declaration states, "We do not associate with the American Communist Party or quasi-Communist parties, just as we do not associate with Fascists or quasi-Fascists, in exactly the same way." This declaration is significant because on December 30th, the "American Progressive Citizens Association" was formed in New York, welcoming all those who embrace liberalism, regardless of race, religion, skin color, original nationality, or political affiliation. This new association has set up its own banner, competing for leadership among American liberals. The American Progressive Citizens Association is a merger of the "National Citizens Political Action Committee" and nine other groups. Former Commerce Secretary Wallace is also a founder.</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers' Trieste Resolution Submitted to Security Council for Approval</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] The decision made by the four foreign ministers regarding the Trieste issue, after much hard work, has been submitted to the United Nations Security Council for final decision. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, in his capacity as chairman of the foreign ministers' conference, sent a letter to the Security Council on this matter, attaching a document on the Trieste issue divided into seven parts. In his letter, he requested the Security Council to make a decision on this matter before January 15, so as to finalize the Italian peace treaty scheduled to be signed in early February. According to the provisions of the Italian peace treaty, Trieste is a free port area, and its independence is guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council.

Syrian representative Curry said today that treaties and agreements should first be concluded between countries and United Nations agencies to ensure their security. The Security Council should first obtain reports on the number of troops in all member states, and then formulate measures to supply the United Nations agencies with forces to ensure peace and security. It is also inappropriate to carry out disarmament before the peace treaties are signed. The issue of atomic energy control should be given priority consideration.</p>

<h3>Soviet Embassy in the United States Wants to Arrest Embezzling Staff</h3>
<p>Has Requested Extradition from the U.S. Department of State</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The Soviet Embassy today submitted a note to the State Department, stating: A Soviet citizen named Alekseev, formerly stationed in Mexico as a staff member of the trade delegation, deserted his post and resided in the United States, and made speeches denouncing the Soviet Union as a "dictatorial hell." This person is actually a criminal, guilty of embezzling public funds, betraying the country, slyly slandering, and fleeing without returning, and should be extradited. The U.S. Department of State has agreed to consider it. Alekseev's lawyer, Li Qimeng, declared in New York tonight that his client solemnly denies all the charges made by the Soviet government, saying that all the charges were fabricated by Soviet officials. Li lawyer did not disclose Alekseev's whereabouts, but he issued a statement last Tuesday, saying that the Soviet government is hated by the people and will no longer allow his family to be oppressed by it. According to a Central News Agency report from Washington, the New York prosecutor said that Ji is now in the United States and is willing to announce his whereabouts.</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Maintain Military Strategic Position in the Middle East; Decides to Deal with the Situation in Palestine with Force; King of Transjordan to Visit Turkey</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] Observers here recently stated that the London Palestine Round Table Conference will resume on the 21st of this month. The general public in Britain believes that maintaining Britain's military base in the Middle East and building an oil pipeline from Mesopotamia to Haifa is as important as protecting the interests of Arabs or Jews. This view will have an impact on the discussions at the Palestine Conference. For this reason, Britain does not attach importance to deciding to establish a single country in Palestine, ruled by the Arab government, or to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. What it pays attention to is to find ways to maintain Britain's military and economic position in the Middle East.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 5th Radio: Field Marshal Montgomery has drafted a plan to use violence to deal with the riots of Jews in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent solemnly pointed out that when High Commissioner for Palestine Cunningham discussed the Palestine issue with British Colonial Secretary Jones yesterday, British Chief of the Imperial General Staff Field Marshal Montgomery also participated, indicating that the government plans to use military measures to deal with the situation in Palestine, where a full state of emergency may be declared. At the same time, existing control and security measures will be tightened. If so, in addition to dealing with the riots of Jewish terrorists with government power, extraordinary military force can also be used to stop them.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 5th] The Port of Haifa implemented special precautions today after the Turkish President Inonu's ship arrived. The ship came to prepare for the King of Transjordan, Abdullah, to take a visit to Turkey. Abdullah is scheduled to arrive in Haifa on Monday. Diplomatic circles here believe that the King of Transjordan's trip is to win Turkey over to join the Arab bloc. It seems that the Arabs are willing to cooperate with Western countries rather than embrace the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Praises the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] MacArthur stated in his October report on the Japanese occupied area that the new Japanese parliament closed in October last year after meeting for 114 days. This parliament has shown itself to be a medium for a truly popular government. The most important achievement was the passage of the new constitution. The second is the passage of the Rural Land Reform Act. If this matter can be put into practice effectively, it can be described as a "Bill of Rights" for the people.</p>

<h3>Paris Incest Case; City is in Uproar</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The entire city of Paris was in an uproar today over the case of father raping daughter and mother raping son. When the police went to 35 Peace Street to arrest Maurice Magran, they saw him in his daughter Nanette's room. Maurice was only wearing a bathrobe, and Nanette was unwilling to answer any questions, but she did not admit that her father had committed any violent acts. Maurice admitted to having a physical relationship with his daughter, but said that there was no coercion and that it was completely voluntary. He said that he discovered last year that his wife was particularly affectionate with his 18-year-old son Peter, and later learned that there was already a physical relationship between mother and son, so he retaliated against his daughter, Nanette, who is 17 years old this year.</p>
<h3>U.S. Invited to Participate in South Pacific Conference; Discussion on Establishing Advisory Council for Non-Self-Governing Areas; Seeking to Promote Progress for Two Million Residents</h3>

The purpose of the conference is for the ruling countries to discuss ways to promote the progress of the two million residents there.</p>
<h3>The Moscow Conference Approaches: The Ins and Outs of the German Question</h3>
<p>The Soviet-occupied zone of Germany is nearing industrial collapse, a situation so dire that the Soviet Union must make a major decision on the German question before this winter. Will it support the Anglo-American plan to unify Germany, or will it disregard all sacrifices and implement the Sovietization of eastern Germany?</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Moves German Industry</p>
<p>Most of the heavy industrial equipment in the Soviet zone has already been moved to the Soviet Union. The remaining industry is insufficient to produce daily necessities for the general public. Severe shortages of essential raw materials such as coal and steel are forcing many factories in eastern Germany to shut down. If the economy of the Soviet zone collapses, all the Soviet Union's efforts to win the friendship of the German people will suffer a severe blow.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union not only transported much factory equipment to the Soviet Union as reparations but also took away the products of the remaining factories under the same pretext. Almost all the products of the Zeiss Ikon optical instrument factory are shipped to the Soviet Union, and almost all textiles are allocated to the Soviet Union. The lack of raw materials is causing these factories' production to decline daily.</p>
<p>Severe Shortage of Raw Materials in the Soviet Zone</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the Soviet Union's lack of materials is that Germany is currently divided into four occupation zones, preventing economic integration. Most of the Soviet zone's industry relies on coal and steel from the Ruhr region, which is now under British control. The Soviet side urgently needs coal from the Ruhr region and has agreed to divide all German coal into four shares, but insists that the design work for coal production must also be jointly decided by the four countries. The British authorities insist that the Soviet Union must first agree to place all German industry under unified management; otherwise, the Soviet Union's proposal cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Soviet Union has only two options: either find coal and steel from elsewhere, such as Poland, or transport coal and steel from its own country to Germany. If it takes this step, it will place an extremely heavy burden on the entire Soviet economic system.</p>
<p>The future economic fate of eastern Germany depends on the outcome of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States Oppose Soviet Measures</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States oppose the Soviet Union's transfer of industrial products from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany to the Soviet Union, arguing that the reparations stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement are limited to the equipment of factories that participated in the war effort, and that the products of general factories after the war are not included in this scope. The export of these products should be used to pay for necessary imports and occupation costs. The United Kingdom and the United States spend millions of dollars annually to import necessary goods to Germany for the people in the British and American zones. If there are surplus goods in the Soviet zone that can be exported, they should be jointly managed by the four countries to reduce the economic burden on each country.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet side argues that the United Kingdom and the United States have handed over very few industrial equipment that should have been dismantled from western Germany and transported to the Soviet Union according to the agreement, and that the work is progressing very slowly. Therefore, the British side has no responsibility to hand over the products of the Soviet zone. In addition, the Soviet Union insists that political unification must precede economic unification. The differences in opinion between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the German question are roughly as follows.</p>
<p>Furthermore, France's position is also an obstacle to the overall unification of Germany. It believes that the western borders of Germany must be determined before participating in discussions on unification. France demands that the Saar region be annexed and that the Ruhr region be separated from Germany to ensure that Germany does not rise again and engage in wars of aggression. France must wait until the security of its eastern border is guaranteed before considering the next step; otherwise, it will oppose discussing the unification of Germany.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States had wanted to consult with the Soviet Union and exclude the French zone of Germany, and first hold negotiations on the merger of the British, American, and Soviet zones, but this also failed, resulting in the Soviet Union adopting a unilateral policy in eastern Germany.</p>
<p>Industry in the Soviet Zone is Divided into Three Categories</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities have now divided the industry in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany into three categories for separate management. One part is managed by the German local government and supervised by the Soviet military headquarters. These factories include those formerly owned by Nazi elements and those that had served the German war machine and employed prisoners of war. Another part of the factories is dedicated to manufacturing equipment for the Soviet army. Factories that manufacture special weapons, such as rockets, are also managed by the Soviet military. However, the production of military equipment in the Soviet zone is not very large. On the contrary, the Soviet Union's domestic military production has continued to increase.</p>
<p>Another part of the factories is managed by the Central Soviet Industrial Association. Most of the important industries are within its management scope. Many military factories currently managed by the Soviet military will eventually be handed over to the Industrial Association. These factories are considered reparations, and the reason they remain in Germany is simply to utilize the skilled personnel that the Soviet Union lacks. These include textile factories, chemical factories, machine factories, fuel factories, and public utilities.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Must Make a Final Choice</p>
<p>Whether these factories will continue to remain in Germany to Sovietize eastern Germany, or be transported to the Soviet Union as reparations, or be used as bargaining chips in discussions on the German unification issue, is still undecided. Only Moscow can make this decision. However, in view of the upcoming meeting of the four foreign ministers in Moscow this spring, and the increasingly serious economic situation in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the Soviet Union should make a final choice in the near future. (Translated by Ya Nong from "World Report Weekly")</p>

The area of collection has increased compared with last year, including the four districts of Yangsi, Tangqiao, Yangjing, and Lihang. Because land prices must be re-evaluated this year, the estimated actual amount collected may reach 20 billion yuan. In addition, the collection of land value tax for the 35th year has been postponed to the 24th of this month due to technical necessities. As of January 4, only six districts in the city, including Huangpu, have collected 3.1 billion yuan, exceeding the planned amount. Relevant personnel believe that with the addition of 1.25 billion yuan in land value tax from enemy and puppet properties, the total may reach as high as 5 billion yuan by the deadline.</p>

<h3>Persevering in the Industrial Struggle: A New Year's Visit to Wu Yun Chu: Talking Freely About the Feelings of Industrial Recovery in the Past Year: Reviewing the Situation of Industrial Zones Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] China's current unstable economic situation is not suitable for running industries, but "even in the darkest storm, the rooster crows incessantly." Industrialists are still fighting tirelessly, and Wu Yun Chu is undoubtedly one of the representatives among these fighters. Yesterday, the reporter visited this gray-haired and approachable veteran industrialist to express New Year's greetings and ask him about his feelings on industrial recovery in the past year. He said that he did not have the figures at hand to give an accurate answer to this question, but his Tianchu factory had only recovered a quarter of its capacity under the efforts of all. Tianyuan in West Shanghai has not yet started construction, and the Tianli factory's resumption of work is uncertain due to a lack of electricity. During the war, he had the ambition to set up a factory in Xinjiang and had made considerable preparations, but the province was then under the rule of Sheng Shicai, and the Lin Lingyong case caused them to have safety concerns. Although there were personnel changes in the provincial government later, the Yining Incident, which had a background, made the situation in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains even more turbulent, and the large-scale textile factory establishment plan originally scheduled to be implemented by the Xinjiang Provincial Government was also shelved. Private factories were even more out of the question. "The difficulties that my factory has encountered are the same as those that other industries in China are experiencing."</p>
<p>External Pressure is No Exception</p>
<p>He pointed out that the speed of our industrial recovery is being restricted by various unfavorable factors at home and abroad. In addition to the general situation, high prices and excessive expenses are the biggest reasons. Wu said with a smile: Although bleaching powder has no sales, the cost of building two bleaching powder towers is 400 million yuan. In addition, imported goods put great pressure on domestic industries, and the chemical industry is no exception. For example, a bucket of American bleaching powder sells for 9 Hong Kong dollars, but the cost of domestic goods is more than doubled. In this situation, the tragic event of dumping bleaching powder into the sea has been created! Reviewing the situation of industrial zones throughout the country, he said that the large-scale industries in the Northeast are very concentrated, but because the military operations have not ended and the order is unstable, the recovery work has not yet begun. Taiwan has cheap electricity and other superior conditions, and the recovery work has begun, but no Taiwanese goods have been found on the market. The reporter asked him about the prospects for industry this year. He said that if the general situation is not optimistic, it is difficult to have great hope.</p>
<p>Japanese Industry is Still Difficult to Fully Recover</p>
<p>The conversation naturally turned from the issue of domestic industrial recovery to the recovery of Japanese industry. Wu's attitude was very calm, and he did not exaggerate the crisis in any way. His observation is that a large-scale chemical industry in Japan is related to military affairs, and these cannot be fully restored this year. However, the industry that used to manufacture nitric acid will now fulfill fertilizer, which is what the United States hopes Japan will use to improve people's lives. Among the industrial reparations from Japan to China, there are very few chemical materials, and most of them belong to liquid fuels. However, how to digest and utilize these reparations materials is a big problem for us. The freight for one ton is at least 1 million legal currency, and a large-scale factory has at least 1,000 tons of materials; the number is very considerable. In addition to the necessary working capital and construction costs, the general private industry cannot bear it. These many practical considerations in the past made private industries not very enthusiastic about reporting losses, so the loss report submitted to the United States by Ambassador Gu Weijun for the first time was particularly small. Now our loss statistics are more complete, but the United States' attitude towards Japan has been very friendly.</p>
<p>Eliminating the Crisis Should Be Jointly Responsible</p>
<p>When talking about the government's industrial policy, Wu said that the government is quite able to accept the opinions of the private sector, but there are too many factors in this crisis. The current production loans are of great help to the industrial sector, but he hopes that they will be handled fairly. The import license system is also a way to protect national industry, and the problem lies in implementation. He believes that in many places, the responsibility should be borne by all parties. For example, the last revision of the exchange rate, the government's decision was correct. At that time, the municipal government convened representatives of the city's industrial and commercial circles and asked them to help stabilize prices in order to avoid affecting social order. However, after the fact, those who did not import raised prices, and those who had imported also raised prices. In this event, to be fair, the responsibility lies with all parties.</p>
<p>Comparison of Efficiency Between State-Owned and Private Enterprises</p>
<p>The reporter asked Wu for his opinion on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' change in the asset valuation method. He said that this is a reasonable measure, and it was proposed at the Chongqing production meeting in the past. In terms of the increase in multiples, it is also close to the actual situation, but the general industry may not be able to bear the 20% cash capital increase. At the same time, under this method, it is equivalent to the official admitting that industry has no money to be made, and the profits tax will become a problem in the future. Regarding the disposal of enemy and puppet factories, the veteran industrialist also expressed many wonderful opinions. To sum up his words: the valuation of enemy and puppet factories was in the spring of last year, and the sale was in the autumn and winter. Prices are changing with each passing day, but the valuation remains unchanged. Therefore, industrialists who take over, if they can make good use of them, will not be a losing deal. As for the big question of state-owned and private enterprises, his views are different from those of general private industrialists. He said: In a capitalist society, due to the stimulation of selfish motives, the efficiency of private enterprises is relatively high, and the efficiency of state-owned enterprises is undeniably relatively low, but the trend of the world is towards socialization! I agree that whether state-owned or private, they should be corporatized, and stocks can be traded publicly on the market. Today it is state-owned, and tomorrow it can become private. In this way, the dispute between state-owned and private enterprises will be resolved without solving it!</p>
<p>Donations Used for Scientific Research</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, Wu announced that he would donate the stocks he held as a fund for chemical research and organize a management committee to manage and use it. The reporter asked him how much this fund was? How is it planned to be used? His answer was: He holds 40% of the stocks of Tianchu and Tianyuan factories, which are worth about 10 billion yuan at the time. At present, the factories have resumed work, and the fund has already received income. As for the use of the fund, a consultant group has already drafted a plan in the past. After the management committee starts working in the future, all plans will be implemented gradually. It is common for a successful industrialist to donate huge sums of money for scientific research in foreign countries. It is a pioneering undertaking in our country. We hope that he can be a successful pioneer in this regard!</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Begging Monks Discovered in Liuhang Town</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, in Liuhang Town, which belongs to the county, a large number of begging monks were suddenly discovered, numbering about 30 people, mixed in the town. The authorities, because of their large number and secretive behavior, detained them all for investigation.</p>
<h3>Yan Huizhu's Old Case is Brought Up Again: General Liu is Detained and Brought to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported from Beiping on the 5th by This Newspaper] According to local reports, at the beginning of the victory two years ago, General Liu, who came to Ping with the army, had a romantic affair with Kunqu opera actress Yan Huizhu (the actress committed suicide because of this). After the matter was revealed, he left Ping and was transferred to another position, and later obtained a chance to go to the United States to work. Recently, the highest authorities ordered the competent authorities to transfer Liu back to the country for investigation. Xun happened to be setting off to return to the country and was captured by a US plane in San Francisco and escorted back to Shanghai, where he is now being detained in a certain military institution. At the beginning of the case, because "Liu" and "Lu" have the same sound, it was once mistakenly reported as Lu Wenzhen, the director of the forward command post of the 11th War Zone in Beiping, and spread for a while.</p>
<h3>Cross-River Project Issues: Final Decision to Be Made, Majority Favor Tunnel Construction, Estimated Cost 76 Billion, Location at Bund of Zhongzheng East Road</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the city's cross-river project, in June of last year, the Shanghai Cross-River Engineering Committee entrusted the China Bridge Company to handle the design and drilling work, stipulating that it be carried out in two phases. The first phase of work included selecting and surveying the site, compiling a report on the research results, and submitting it to the Cross-River Engineering Committee for study and decision on the location and type of project. The second phase of work included drilling the geological conditions of the Pujiang River at the selected site, designing engineering drawings, preparing engineering budgets, drafting engineering plans, and preparing bidding and contracting procedures. The China Bridge Company received design funding in August of last year and began the first phase of work. After research, four types of cross-river engineering methods were proposed: (1) Constructing a tunnel under the Huangpu River. (2) Constructing a high-level fixed bridge that allows tall-masted ships to pass underneath. (3) Constructing a low-level movable bridge that opens and closes at designated times for ships to pass. (4) Constructing a fixed bridge upstream of the Pujiang River, allowing only medium-sized ships to pass, with tall-masted ships limited to mooring downstream of the bridge location.</p>
<p>After Director Zhao Zukang of the Municipal Public Works Bureau convened the second technical advisory committee meeting for the cross-river project last week, advisors Yuan, Zheng Hua, Zhu Guoxi, Huang Yan, Chen Yimin, Kang Lituo, and others discussed and concluded that the tunnel and low-level movable bridge options were more suitable and less expensive to construct. According to estimates by the China Bridge Company, constructing a tunnel would require approximately 76 billion yuan, while a bridge would require 41.2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Two Locations Determined</p>
<p>Regarding the conditions for selecting a site for the cross-river project, the following was decided: (1) It cannot be too far from the city center to avoid circuitous roads, affecting the time and expenses of most passengers. (2) The roads connecting the approach bridges must be able to accommodate cross-river vehicles in addition to the original transportation volume. (3) The location of the approach bridges or walkways must not interfere with nearby or perpendicular existing transportation systems. (4) During construction, damage to existing buildings should be minimized. (5) After completion, the approach bridges should not block the light of buildings on both sides or obstruct the access of residents on both sides. (6) The tunnel exit must not be affected by tidal backflow from the river. (7) Obstruction to water traffic during and after construction must be minimal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the preliminary discussions determined the following construction locations for the cross-river project: (1) Reserve the Bund of Zhongzheng East Road as the location for building a tunnel. (2) Assume that the Shiliupu area is the location for building a movable bridge.</p>
<p>Tunnel Saves Time</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter specifically visited Zhu Guoxi, director of the engineering structure department of the Public Works Bureau, to inquire about the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of bridges and tunnels. According to Zhu, the majority opinion of the technical advisory committee leans towards building a tunnel. Although the construction of a tunnel is more costly, its benefits to transportation are greater. For the sake of a permanent solution, traffic regulation must rely on a tunnel. After the construction of a movable bridge, the passage of vehicles and ships would be limited by time, while a tunnel would save time and have no slope resistance. The technical advisory committee has made a detailed comparison of bridges and tunnels, and a final decision is expected at the third meeting convened by the Public Works Bureau on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>No Problem with Funding</p>
<p>Regarding the funding for the cross-river project, it is rumored that the land appreciation tax method will be adopted. After the completion of the cross-river project, the land within approximately one kilometer around the project will directly benefit, and the land price will inevitably increase. Either the original landowners will pay the increased value, or the government will purchase the land at the original price and resell it at the increased value. If the increase is calculated tenfold, then there will be no concern about the funding for the project. Once the cross-river project is decided, it is rumored that the Bank of China and others are willing to invest. Therefore, there is no problem with funding.</p>
<p>According to estimates by hydraulic experts, the construction of the cross-river project will take approximately one year.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Shooting Case: "Little Pockface" Arrested, Confesses to Several Cases</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) Xu Jia Hui Police Precinct Chief and Deputy Chief Bo Dexin, Xu Guoliang, based on confidential reports stating that the fierce bandit known as "Little Pockface" was the main perpetrator in the shooting and wounding of Police Officer Bao Changtao, badge number 815, of the Jing'an Temple Precinct at the intersection of Zhongzheng West Road and Fumin Road on the morning of the 24th of last month, and was currently hiding in Fahuazhen. Upon receiving the report, Chief Bo immediately ordered Section Chief Yong Shao of the Second Section, along with Section Members Sun Shanggeng, plainclothes officers Ma Shifan, Yin Mengfei, Zhao Chunpu, Zhang Shouzheng, and others, to disguise themselves and rush to the area to wait at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday. Soon after, they saw "Little Pockface" arrive, and the officers bravely rushed forward and grabbed him. They found a box cannon and eight bullets, all loaded, on the bandit's person. He was then taken back to the precinct for strict interrogation.

He also confessed to committing several theft cases, including at the homes of the Fang family at No. 330, Xin Yi Li, Datong Road, and Zhu Genfu at No. 110, Shanhaiguan Road, stealing gold jewelry and legal tender, which he divided and spent with his accomplices.</p>
<h3>US Military Humiliation of Female Student: Jiaotong University and Shanghai University Professors Issue Written Opinions, Demanding Prompt Handling to Prevent Recurrence</h3>
<p>Professors Liu Dajie, Gao Junshan, Zhang Yaoxiang, Shen Youqian, Yu Qingtang, Wang Guoxiu, Liu Xian, Qian Zhongshu, Sun Guiding, Chen Xuanxian, Wang Chengzhu, Yu Nanqiu, Chen Kemei, Huang Jiade, Hu Zuyin, Zuo Renxia, Jiang Zaihua, and Huang Jiayin from Jiaotong University and St. John's University in the city issued written opinions on the case of the rape of a Peking University female student by a US soldier, stating that this incident of a US soldier raping a Chinese female student in Peking is an unforgivable atrocity. All Chinese people express their grief, anger, and protest against this indecent act. We express our gratitude for the assistance and sympathy that the US military gave to China during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but the actions of this type of US soldier will undoubtedly cause the Chinese people to lose their goodwill towards the United States. This is undoubtedly a serious loss to the spirit of cooperation between the Chinese and American people. We demand that the government lodge a serious protest with the responsible US authorities, publicize the truth of the facts in the near future, severely punish the perpetrators, compensate for the losses, publicly apologize, and, more importantly, that the government take the most effective measures to prevent the recurrence of this type of atrocity. At the same time, we demand that the US military authorities, in this atmosphere of intense anger, handle this case with the fairest attitude and the quickest methods, and also find ways to restore the sympathy of the Chinese people for the US military that has been lost this time.</p>
<h3>United Anti-Riot Federation Issues Letter to All Sectors</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai University Student United Anti-Riot Federation," organized by students from various universities in the city, issued a letter to fellow compatriots from all sectors yesterday to oppose a small number of students who, under the guise of protesting against the atrocities of the US military, attempted to incite strikes, market closures, and work stoppages to disrupt social order. The original text is as follows: "Fellow compatriots, we are deeply angered by the unfortunate incident in Peiping, in which Mr. Shen was humiliated. As this incident spread throughout the country, universities and colleges in various places have already issued just appeals and condolences, and have held a one-day strike to show their protest and demand that the perpetrators be severely punished, that damages be compensated, and that guarantees be given that similar incidents will not occur again in the future. The US military authorities have now fully accepted. This matter should be urged by the government, and we look forward to a satisfactory outcome. As matters have developed to this point, they could have come to an end, but a small number of conspirators and unscrupulous individuals in our city want to use this unfortunate incident to expand their distorted propaganda and use it as a tool for an anti-American movement, attempting to incite people from all walks of life to incite strikes, market closures, and work stoppages to disrupt the peace and tranquility of society. In view of this, our association has exposed its conspiracy and advised people from all walks of life not to be used by unscrupulous elements. The fact that a US soldier in Peiping insulted a female student is purely a legal matter and should not be confused with a political matter. The fault of one US soldier should not represent the actions of the entire US military. The relationship between China and the United States has always been very close, and the friendship between China and the United States cannot be lost due to the fault of one US soldier. Now that the US military authorities have fully accepted the demands we have made, how can we have any more harsh conditions? We hope that people from all walks of life will remain calm, recognize the facts, and not be incited by conspirators and follow blindly. Our slogans are: (1) Oppose the use of students by various parties as sacrifices in political struggles. (2) All parties should immediately withdraw from schools. (3) Request the government to promptly punish the perpetrators. (4) Overthrow the rioters who incite "strikes," "work stoppages," and "market closures" to disrupt social order. (5) Please do not only consider the interests of the party and put the nation and the country to death. (6) The atrocities of the US military should be resolved through legal and diplomatic means.</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law's Business Is Slow, Old Woman Ends Life by Hanging</h3>
<p>The old woman Wang Shen of Haining, who is seventy-two years old this year, only gave birth to a daughter, who married the peddler Lin Xiaofang as his wife. Shen lived with her son-in-law, residing at No. 216 Shunchang Road. Recently, her son-in-law's business has been slow, and he has been living in sorrow all day. Therefore, Shen suddenly had the thought of ending her life. At 6:00 AM yesterday, taking advantage of the fact that no one was paying attention, she hanged herself in her room. Her son-in-law discovered her, but it was too late to save her. The police station then carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang to await inspection.</p>
<h3>Tram and Car Collide</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 10:30 AM yesterday, a French Concession Line 2 tram, No. 105, was traveling south to north on Wanping Road when it reached the intersection of Hengshan Road. Suddenly, a Ying Shang No. 11987 commercial car sped past. The tram driver was unable to brake in time, and the two vehicles collided.

<h3>War of Resistance Literature Exhibition: A Sobering Review</h3>
<p>[Special Article from Our Newspaper] The eight-year arduous War of Resistance Against Japan ended just over a year ago, but the past hatred, trauma, and humiliation seem to have been submerged by the heavy burden of life. The opening of the War of Resistance Literature Exhibition reopens old wounds and gives us a sobering review.</p>
<p>In this exhibition, one can see three opposing forces during the War of Resistance: a force of justice, a force of invaders, and a force of collaborators who acted as accomplices to the tigers.</p>
<p>Initially, the first force suffered considerable and cruel blows. In the light and shadow of the gunfire, one sees the entire suffering of Shanghai: the great fire in Zhabei, Fudan University in the rubble, Luodian, which was lost and regained in a seesaw battle, and the most important work in the atmosphere of ammunition, rescue, and burial. These all have a tragic tone. Secondly, we saw the retreat from Songhu, the siege of the Four Lines Warehouse, the underground workers struggling in the enemy's iron net, and the tortures of the enemy and "76." Here, there is the terrifying face of Liu Zhigang after being injected with poison, Jiang Menglin's severed right ear after being injured, and the corpses and bloodstains of countless unyielding people... But slowly, this atmosphere of terror finally dissipated in the sunlight of victory. Colorful pictorials, nationwide celebrations, and the solemn proclamations of the military police and garrison headquarters ended the eight-year course of the War of Resistance in another atmosphere of joy.</p>
<p>To understand the means by which the enemy invaded our country, one must pay attention to the activities of traitors who betrayed the motherland. In the many photos displayed in the corridor, we see a kind of terrifying silence, a kind of anesthetized revelry. The enemy and puppet's duplicitous slogans are ironclad evidence of hypocritical friendship and enslavement propaganda. We see the banquets of the enemy and puppet ringleaders, the so-called Greater East Asia Literary Representative Conference, and the exhibition of works by artists who collaborated with the enemy. We also see the enemy and puppet's collection of metals and forced purchase of cotton cloth, as well as a dramatic gambling den. This fully demonstrates the ugly state of friction and contradiction between the enemy and the collaborators.</p>
<p>Most of the items displayed in the second exhibition room are the inferior deeds left by the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance. Wang Jingwei's declaration of war and the dregs of the chaotic economy in the occupied areas, such as military tickets, Chinese bonds, small change tickets printed by stores, etc. In addition, there are Japanese ancient religious rituals, ancient armor statues, etc., which give us a kind of understanding of the traditional temperament of the Japanese nation. At the same time, it also reveals that although Japan has failed, we cannot ignore Japan's suppressed aggressive ambitions.</p>
<h3>Book Industry Petition Representatives Go to Beijing Again Today, Counterparts from All Regions Respond One After Another</h3>
<p>The book industry, in order to request exemption from business tax, has repeatedly convened emergency meetings and decided to go to Beijing again to petition. It is reported that the delegation of Li Bojia, Zheng Nongshan, Lu Baozhong, Zhou Xihe, Xu Boxin, Liu Jikang, Yao Pengzi, Wang Mengzou, Jiang Zhenzhan, and others, a group of twenty people, will go to Beijing today to submit petitions directly to the relevant agencies, such as the Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, to strive for the complete exemption of business tax and to demand that cultural undertakings be given emergency and effective relief. It is also heard that since the book industry association telegraphed its counterparts throughout the country, hoping to strive together, it has successively received responses from the trade associations in Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Bengbu, Kaifeng, Chongqing, Liyang, Qingdao, Huaining (Anqing), Jiangdu, Nanchang, Jingxian (Anhui) and other places, all of whom insisted on the complete exemption of business tax, otherwise they would not hesitate to make any sacrifices and would be willing to serve as a backing.</p>
<h3>Gao Sheng Bargain Sale of Goods: Harmonious Relationship Between Labor and Management</h3>
<p>Gao Sheng, a paper store in this city, suffered heavy losses due to the mob's destruction of the peddler case twice before, and is still unable to continue operating. All the employees, mostly old workers with decades of experience, have a harmonious relationship with the capital side on weekdays, so even though the store has been closed for a long time, they all hold the purpose of sharing weal and woe and are unwilling to leave. The store owner recently decided to sell the remaining ledgers, paper, etc. at a low price from today to maintain the lives of the workers, so that the proceeds can be used to help both labor and capital through the difficult years, as the end of the year is approaching.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Wu Lvpíng Reports That His Wife Is Using Drugs</h3>
<p>Lawyer Wu Lvping, who lives at No. 6, Alley 4, Linsen East Road, reported to the judicial section of the Taishan Precinct yesterday morning that he and Zhang Sufen, a woman from Wuxi, (37 years old), have lived together for 20 years. Their relationship was very close, and they had three sons and three daughters. Unexpectedly, in recent years, it was discovered that Zhang Sufen had an opium habit. She often sneaks to Yanziwo in Jiumu, to smoke opium, but because her whereabouts are secretive, the location of the Yanziwo cannot be found. Recently, she has not regretted her actions and has even pawned almost all the clothes and jewelry in her home. After I discovered and condemned her, she even retorted. Therefore, I had no choice but to report the case and request that the case be summoned and investigated according to the law. Section Chief Zhang, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered officers to summon Zhang Sufen for interrogation. According to Zhang, she admitted that she had smoked it before because she was ill after giving birth, but now she had already quit and broken her addiction. The reason for the report was that her husband had an affair and refused to give her living expenses. Therefore, he reported the case. Section Chief Zhang then said that whether or not Zhang had drugs could not be trusted, pending a transfer to the hospital for testing, before the verification would be handled.</p>
<h3>Small Dispute at Guanglu Theater: Conflict Arises Over Watching a Movie Without a Ticket</h3>

Because they entered the theater without tickets, a conflict occurred with the theater manager, Norwegian Tai Weiaosikai. Tai's glasses fell to the ground and shattered. The police station received a report and sent officers to the scene to suppress the situation. The two police officers who caused the incident were taken to the station. After questioning by the bureau, the theater did not want to pursue the matter, and the two police officers were willing to pay for the damage at market price. Thus, the dispute was resolved.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on Local Drama</h3>
<p>— Special Article from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>Chinese opera, like language, varies from place to place. The so-called southern tunes and northern melodies, Yue tunes and Thai tunes, are mostly based on place names. That is, the Kun opera, which was once popular, and the Peking opera, which is popular today, have both evolved from local operas. The scripts of local operas are a kind of popular literature, derived from the mountain songs and folk tunes sung by farmers. Therefore, the earliest local operas were vulgar, crude, and simple, and could only be performed on temporary stages and were not considered elegant. Later, once refined by literati, they were like village girls walking into the city, wearing rouge and powder to dress themselves up. The words of the drama, the music of the accompaniment, the props, costumes, etc., were all very particular, and thus the small opera became a large opera. Then, from the small city in a corner, it expanded to the nearby counties, and even the provincial capitals and the capital, and the territory slowly expanded. The audience gradually became universal, and from then on, it was no longer regarded as a local opera. The Pingju opera is the best example of this evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Since the opening of Shanghai as a port, it has become a metropolis where people from all directions gather. People from all over come to see it, so local operas, which provide entertainment for people from all over, are also widely popular in Shanghai. The early Kun opera and the more recent Peking opera have long lost the characteristics of local operas. As for purely local operas, in the past, they were concentrated in amusement parks and occasionally performed in teahouses. It cannot be said to have any status. The main body of the audience is the petty bourgeoisie, and even if there are occasional performances, there will not be many.</p>
<p>After the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the entertainment industry also changed. The spoken drama, which claimed to have a cultural mission, was always unable to gain popularity, and the Ping opera, which had been unique for a hundred years, was also tending to decline, but local operas were very fortunate to develop. At first, the Shen opera seized the position of the Su beach, and the Yue opera was not willing to be outdone and窜rose up. The Bangbang opera of the North, I wonder how many people it fascinated. Now, the Bangbang opera has been silent. The Shen opera and the Yue opera have entered the theater from the teahouse. In the past four or five years, countless wives and milk wives were fascinated, and to this day, they are still considered the two major forces in local opera.</p>
<p>Other forms, such as the Suzhou ballad and storytelling popular in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the large drum books of the North, although they have not been put on stage, can also be regarded as a type of local opera and have been performed in Shanghai. However, pure northern-style large drum books, comic dialogues, and Zhui Zi operas can only occasionally raise their heads and cannot last. On the other hand, the Suzhou ballad and storytelling have attracted a large audience, and especially after the prevalence of radio, they have gradually expanded their influence. In local opera, they are要considered one of the important links.</p>
<h3>The Decline of Suzhou Opera</h3>
<p>Tanhuang can be said to be a very common local opera. The current Shanghai Opera, originally named Local Tanhuang, and Yue Opera are also transformations of Tanhuang. In addition, there are Hangzhou Tanhuang, Ningbo Tanhuang, and various others. Suzhou Tanhuang was once extremely popular. During its heyday, Wang Meiyu's popularity far surpassed Yao Shuijuan and Yuan Xuefen today. Indeed, Suzhou Tanhuang is considered relatively refined among local operas. Although the content is also shallow and vulgar, it does not have obscene parts, rarely has low-grade taste, and wins the audience's praise by performing humorous acts and singing popular tunes. It can be said to be both noble and popular entertainment. However, the reason for its decline may also be due to the word "noble."</p>
<p>Suzhou Tanhuang was adapted from Kunqu Opera. Suzhou Tanhuang mostly has what Kunqu Opera has, but the lyrics are not as elegant as Kunqu Opera, and mostly plain and popular, and the spoken language is almost the same as Kunqu Opera. The instruments do not include gongs and drums, nor flutes, but only silk and bamboo instruments for accompaniment. The roles are divided into male, female, painted face, and clown. As for the scripts, there is a distinction between complete plays and excerpted plays. Complete plays, such as The Peony Pavilion, The Story of the Pipa, and Occupying the Flower Queen, are all long plays. Excerpted plays are taken from long plays, such as Broken Bridge, Teasing the Uncle, and Thinking of the Mortal World, which are all main plays, called the "front Tan." There is also an independent short play, biased towards humor, aimed at amusing and entertaining, such as Ma Langdang, Selling Olives, etc., called "back Tan."</p>
<p>Founded by Qian of Wuxian County at the End of the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>It is said that Suzhou Tanhuang was founded by Qian Mingshu, a scholar from Wuxian County at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Qian was proficient in Kunqu Opera. Because he lamented that the songs were too highbrow and few people could appreciate them, he created a new style, changing the elegant Kunqu Opera into popular Suzhou Tanhuang. Therefore, the "front Tan" is actually a misnomer for "Qian Tan." In fact, Tanhuang already existed during the Qianlong period. Qian adapted a few plays, just like today's literati adapting scripts for actors, which cannot be called creation. However, this kind of local opera, after being touched by literati, is naturally different from others. Moreover, Qian was also proficient in Kunqu Opera, so the rise of Suzhou Tanhuang in the past was no accident.</p>
<p>Suzhou Tanhuang was already very popular in the early years of the Republic of China. Fan Shaoshan was the most popular in Shanghai's Suzhou Tanhuang in the early days. At that time, Shanghai's Suzhou Tanhuang was almost entirely controlled by Fan. Seven or eight out of ten of Fan's disciples were there. A little later than Fan, there was also a Xiao Guisun, who was also very famous. At that time, Suzhou Tanhuang was all sung while sitting. If makeup was added and performed in a theatrical way, it was called "Makeup Suzhou Tanhuang," which was a new style created by Fei Xileng. The Wang Meiyu sisters were the earliest female Suzhou Tanhuang performers, and they were very popular and their business was booming. Then, Jiang Wanzhen, Shi Xiangyun, and others followed suit, creating the golden age of Suzhou Tanhuang.</p>
<p>Shanghai Opera Rises, Suzhou Opera Declines</p>
<p>As Shanghai Opera gradually rises, Suzhou Tanhuang is declining day by day. Now it has been put into a cold palace. Except for a little decoration in amusement parks, no one pays attention to it anymore. The practitioners of Suzhou Tanhuang have changed their careers, and most of the troupes have also disbanded. The only ones left are Zhu Guoliang and a few others, who, because of their outstanding composing and singing skills, are able to support this broken situation. The reason for the decline of Suzhou Tanhuang is not because of changes in the audience's preferences. It is because of the social and economic changes over the years, many leisured classes need more low-level, more vulgar and obscene things. Since Suzhou Tanhuang cannot cater to the audience, its decline is inevitable.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Tanhuang, which Hanghzou people call Ankang, and Ningbo Tanhuang, sometimes abbreviated as Yong Opera, have never seen any special progress in Tanhuang, but they can still maintain their original status. Especially Ningbo Tanhuang, because Ningbo people occupy a large influence in Shanghai's financial circles, it will not completely decline. As for Changzhou, Wuxi and other places, there are also Tanhuang, but its popularity is limited to the surrounding area, and it does not have much influence in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Transferred from Dongxiang Tune to Shanghai Opera</h3>
<p>"After sitting, I get up, and the young daughter of the Zhang family sighs about her life. Suddenly, she remembers something in her heart, remembers a story about housework. My parents didn't raise three sons and four daughters, but only raised a pair of us siblings..."</p>
<p>Ladies and misses who are worried about listening to Shanghai Opera can almost hum this passage. Shanghai Opera is now called Huju, probably because the two words Huju are more refined. In the countryside, it is called "Tanhuang", also called "Local Tanhuang", indicating some differences from "Suzhou Tanhuang" and "Ningbo Tanhuang." Shanghai Opera was originally "Dongxiang Tune," originated in Pudong, so until now, the language in Shanghai Opera is still completely Pudong accent. Before that, it was "Flower Drum Opera." In the Shanghai Prosperity Records published in the tenth year of Guangxu (1884), there is a poem about Flower Drum Opera: "Gathering fairies in Changyue Building, charming voices sing out Xiao Zhutian, listening to it is the most heart-stirring, laugh and call the sweetheart to sleep together."</p>
<p>The "Xiao Zhutian" mentioned in the poem is one of the Shanghai Opera scripts, so the origin of Shanghai Opera is not too late. At that time, Shanghai Opera and Flower Drum Opera were almost confused, but Flower Drum Opera has drama performances, while Shanghai Opera's "Dongxiang Tune" only has tunes and no drama.</p>
<p>Flower Drum</p>
<p>Flower Drum Opera has always been regarded as obscene, because there are many suggestive erotic parts in its performance, lyrics, and dialogues. Most people look down on the "actors" who sing Flower Drum Opera. The performers also think that this name is too dishonorable, so they have repeatedly changed the name. During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, Zhu Lian, a Qingpu man, wrote a book "Mingzhai Xiaoshi", in which there is a record of Flower Drum Opera, which begins by saying: "Flower Drum Opera has been around for less than thirty years, and has changed many times!"</p>
<p>It is now difficult to check the year of birth of Flower Drum Opera, but according to the above-mentioned "Mingzhai Xiaoshi" sentence, it can be inferred that it was around forty years before Qianlong. At first, it was played during the day, and later it was changed to be done at night. According to Songnan Yuefu, the instruments used are: men beat gongs, women beat drums at both ends, and harmonize with huqin and flute boards. At first, the actors were all men, but later women also participated. However, many of the female actors in Flower Drum Opera were unprincipled women, which also became an important reason for Flower Drum Opera itself to suffer dishonor. Mao Duishan's Moyu Record says: "When the Shanghai Concession was first established, there were Flower Drum Grannies among the prostitutes." This shows a glimpse of the situation at that time.</p>
<p>Those Who Forbid, Forbid Themselves; Those Who Sing, Sing Themselves</p>
<p>Flower Drum Opera is often banned because of its obscenity, but because it is easy to understand and popular, it is very popular among the people, so those who forbid, forbid themselves, and those who sing, sing themselves. In the second year of the Republic of China, when Wu Xin was the magistrate of Shanghai County, he commissioned Li Qi as the director of the Popular Education Office and organized a popular lecture country, which included "improving Flower Drum." The following year, Shi Lanting, Shao Wenbin, Hu Xuechang and others initiated the Zhenxin Collection and renamed it Shanghai Opera, but the content was "still the same."</p>
<p>Shanghai Opera scripts are divided into "big plays" and "small plays." Plays like Catching Tooth Worms and Selling Water Chestnuts are small plays, and plays like Lu Yachen Selling His Wife are big plays. The plot of the small plays is very simple, mostly one man and one woman, flirting and scolding each other, and chatting for a while. Take the "Catching Tooth Worms" play as an example: Characters: Small Thief—Male role</p>
<p>Catching Tooth Worms Wife—Female role</p>
<p>Plot: Meeting on the road, the thief invites to catch tooth</p>
<p>worms, Guanwang, fortune-telling, looking at wind</p>
<p>water, making a fuss.</p>
<h3>The Scholar in Distress Wins the Top Prize; A Private Arrangement is Made in the Back Garden</h3>
<p>The so-called "big play" of course refers to its relatively complex plot, more characters, and some props and the like. To put it bluntly, its story is also the same, always some "scholar in distress wins the top prize, a private arrangement is made in the back garden", and in the end "the treacherous ministers are all killed, and the imperial decree is a happy reunion", so the audience wipes away their tears, smiles and gets up, and walks out of the theater...</p>
<p>The lyrics of Shanghai Opera are as monotonous as the plot of the story. For example, the opening is either "After sitting, I get up" or "The sun rises in the east and shines on the window screen", describing walking fast is "three steps changed to two steps, walking one mile to pass one village", singing that someone is about to die is "the King of Hell is destined to die at three o'clock, and will not keep people until five o'clock", describing a young girl is definitely "twenty-nine to marry the son-in-law is eighteen years old"... and so on, there are many. The tune is simple, each sentence is often seven characters, completely made up of local words, such as "Hao Hao Zao Zao turns the door", "Never posted to marry an official", "Thinking in the stomach and discussing in the heart", "After watching, wrap the body" and so on. People like us who don't like to listen to Shanghai Opera always feel a little impatient.</p>
<h3>Rivers, Lakes, Rivers, Seas, Clear Waves, Passing Far Beyond the Carefree Dao</h3>
<p>Occasionally, there are also "thoughtful" things in the lyrics, such as many big or small plays that like to use characters with the same radicals, such as "Rivers, lakes, rivers, seas, clear waves, passing far beyond the carefree Dao," using couplets, such as "Yu, Xia, Shang, Zhou, Han, five hundred Hanlin scholars, thousands of Jinshi; Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing, thirteen pavilion elders, nine dukes" and so on. There is also the opening of "Little Widow Selling Rice":</p>
<p>"Fragrant lotus and clear water move with the cool breeze, the water moves with the cool breeze and the days are longer, the long days are cool in summer, the wind moves the water, the cool breeze moves the water, the green lotus is fragrant", which is composed with palindrome, although it is simply "unrelated" to the main text, but these "small gimmicks" can still grab many audiences. Another example is the section of "Lu Yachen Asks His Mother-in-Law", each sentence is embedded with the name of tea leaves, and the section sung by the Dan at the opening of "Xiao Farewell" is embedded with the name of medicine in each sentence. Furthermore, maximizing the use of number games is also a unique gimmick in Shanghai Opera.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Opera</h3>
<p>After Shanghai Opera invaded the city from the countryside, it was initially located in tea houses. Because the official authorities cracked down and hooligans harassed, it was performed intermittently. It was not until the opening of the amusement park that it had the opportunity to develop. But the first amusement park, like "Lou Wai Lou", did not have a Shanghai Opera venue. Later, Huang Chuju founded the New World Club near Nicheng Bridge. Knowing that some tourists like to listen to local operas, he also recruited Shanghai Opera. At that time, "Ben Tan" was performed, because there were not many audiences, and the theater was located in a small venue. Later, Huang opened the Great World again, and Ben Tan began to strive to compete with Suzhou Tanhuang. The female protagonist used female performances and no longer "men dressed as women", and used makeup technology. Shanghai Opera gradually became popular. Wang Xiaoxin, Shi Chunxuan, Xiao Wenbin, Ma Jinsheng, Zhu Quangen and others were all popular roles in Shanghai Opera more than ten years ago. Now, Xiao Wenbin and Shi Chunxuan are still leading Shanghai Opera. After the popularity of radio, Shanghai Opera used broadcast advertisements to expand its influence and laid the foundation. During the Anti-Japanese War, various local dramas flourished on the isolated island, and Shanghai Opera was unwilling to let others, so it went from the amusement park to the theater. Most of the five million people in Shanghai speak the local language, and Shanghai Opera, which is purely performed in local dialect, is of course very popular. Coupled with the progress of commerce and the prosperity of the market, its influence should increase unabated.</p>
<p>However, the fragility of the foundation of Shanghai Opera is an undeniable fact. Therefore, when performing, the script is not good, the singing, dialogue, stage steps, etc. are plain and messy, and too little attention is paid to them. The roles are mixed, the costumes cannot match, and the directing techniques are chaotic. There are many flaws. When modern drama is moving towards new places, Shanghai Opera itself really needs to be improved to avoid being eliminated. In this regard, Shanghai Opera actors and researchers should work hard and never hold on to the old and destroy the life of Shanghai Opera. As for the method of improvement, many advanced drama people have already researched it, so I don't need to nag here, so I'll stop here.</p>
<h3>Bengbeng Opera Has a Unique Value of Existence; I Hope That Those Engaged in Popular Literature Movement Will Organize and Improve It</h3>
<p>Speaking of Bai Yushuang, old Shanghai people should remember it. At that time, she performed on stage, and I don’t know how many people were fascinated. Because it originated around Tangshan. As for the origin of the name "Bengbeng Opera", it is mostly because the instrument used in the opera is mainly bangzi, which is a round bar made of hardwood, about an inch in diameter and five or six inches long. Another wooden hammer is used to knock. The sound is unusually loud, "beng beng beng" non-stop, so it is called Bengbeng Opera. At first, it was almost the same as "playing tricks." The performers used bangzi to gather the audience and performed everywhere when going to fairs or markets. In fact, Bengbeng Opera has another name, called "Fengtian Ping Opera," which is more vulgar, that is, "Fengtian Luozi."</p>
<p>The so-called "Ping Opera" is actually to stage "Ping Shu". For example, in "Ma Widow Opens a Shop", Ma Widow always has a sentence when she enters the stage: "Here comes the beauty Ma Widow". For example, in "Du Shiniang" and "Pearl Shirt", the people who go off the stage often sing the last sentence: "Press ×× and don't show it", so the people who go on stage continue to sing: "Show Jiaowa ××× again". These fully demonstrate the form of Ping Shu, but Ping Shu is played by one person playing many roles, while Ping Opera assigns roles and adds some bangzi tunes.</p>
<p>The source of Bengbeng Opera is Ping Shu, so many characteristics are the same. The first is "popular", the words and dialogues are all in colloquial language, and the tone is the same as usual. Wherever the background of the script is, the local dialect is used, and every word and every sentence is easy to understand, so women and children like to listen to it. The second is "delicate". People who have listened to Ping Shu know that the storyteller tells the details of the story in detail. Bengbeng Opera is also the same. A room can sing three or four hundred words. Du Shiniang has several long sections of lyrics after being sent away, describing the evolution of her psychology.</p>
<p>The advantages are as described above, but the disadvantages are also very many. Because it is a product of feudal society, the whole is an old form and an old content. For example, the singing is sometimes vulgar and incomprehensible, and the rhyme is forced. For example, there is a section in "Dalong Prostitutes": "I have read Chinese and history, self-cultivation, geography, and literature, making poems and writing essays, drumming and blowing the horn to exercise, I have graduated from higher primary school, and there is a diploma in the box". This kind of "delicacy" is really dare not accept it, especially the sentence "do exercise", it's simply outrageous! This also shows its low cultural level. Furthermore, the lyrics of the play are incoherent before and after, and the plot is contradictory. The so-called "complete" play has many superfluous places, which are nagging and annoying. In terms of the content of the script itself, they are all licentious plays and jokes. The word "consciousness" is not mentioned at all. However, having said that, Bengbeng Opera is not really something that "disdains a glance". Although it is not "great elegance", it also has a unique value of existence and has become a kind of folk art. Therefore, what is hoped is that people engaged in popular literature movement should organize and improve it, and use new, meaningful and vital content to replace those old, corrupt and feudal products.</p>
<p>The topic turns to the situation of Bengbeng Opera in Shanghai: Shanghai is like a big pot, no matter sweet, sour, bitter or spicy, it needs to accommodate some Bengbeng Opera. Of course, Bengbeng Opera has to come to Shanghai to get a share. At first, in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the Republic of China, there was a Bengbeng Opera troupe in the miscellaneous class of the Great World. This was probably the first Bengbeng Opera troupe to come to Shanghai. But the performance was not good. Except for a few "fellow villagers", almost no one went to ask about it.</p>
<p>Bengbeng Opera became popular in Shanghai in the winter of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China. Zhu Baoxia, the female role of Bengbeng Opera, was invited to Shanghai and opened a "Hebei Theater" downstairs in the New World. Since then, Bengbeng Opera began to perform alone in Shanghai. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Bai Yushuang was expelled to Shanghai by the local mayor in Beijing for "obstructing customs". Someone invited him to perform at the Central Theater. At that time, the ticket sold for one yuan, which was quite "expensive", but because Bai Yu's expression was coquettish, she was able to attract general erotic audiences. Therefore, Bengbeng Opera was very popular, and plays such as "Ma Widow Opens a Shop" and "Shooting the Little Old Mom" became popular among Shanghai citizens.</p>
<p>However, the reason why Bengbeng Opera can be popular in Shanghai is entirely due to the effect of the sex appeal. The licentious words and gestures are unbearable to look at, which is really a sad phenomenon for Bengbeng Opera itself. Now, Shanghai people have been away from Bengbeng Opera for a long time, and it is rare for anyone to think of it. Bengbeng Opera has gone into decline.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Opera</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, in addition to the "Weiyang Class" performed in amusement parks, there are also dozens of theaters specializing in this kind of opera. They are mostly located near small vegetable markets or tea countries, attracting a lot of audiences, of course, purely small citizens.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Opera was originally the "Yancheng Class" popular in the six counties of North Huai, and the plays performed were all about love affairs between men and women. The number of people in each class is not large, ranging from more than ten to two or thirty people, with male and clown roles, and the roles are complete. They never advertise, but the business is always very good, especially in January, February and March of each year, it is almost always full. When business is slow in winter, they try to change classes and exchange the actors of the two theaters. Or maybe there will be a grand gathering. Recently, "Tongshang" in Nicheng Bridge has performed a grand gathering of twelve classes.</p>
<p>The Yangzhou theater is a multi-event place. Three-light mafiosi can freely enter and exit. If the ticket collector has not broken into the street, he can forget about taking on this job. It is very common for quarrels to occur over supplementing tickets or not being allowed to enter. So there are "tycoons" among the hoodlums who come to serve as special consultants. Although the theater loses a salary, it avoids a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>On the radio station, Weiyang Opera also once invaded and gradually became valued. Like other local operas, it is mediocre, shallow, and obscene, but it is full of low-level tastes, so it can grasp many audiences.</p>
<h3>The Once Popular Yue Opera: The Most Flourishing Period in Shanghai Reached as Many as Thirty Theaters</h3>
<p>Yue Opera and Shen Opera are undoubtedly the two major bulwarks of local opera in Shanghai today. Their popular plots and large audiences have surprisingly swept the city. The elegant Kun Opera has certainly declined, and the traditional Peking Opera (Pi Huang) has also become a spent force. Yue Opera has a grand ambition to rise and replace them. However, recalling the rise and fall of the Suzhou Opera (Su Tan), Ningbo Opera (Yong Ju), and Bang Bang Opera, it is still unknown whether Yue Opera can maintain its lasting fate.</p>
<p>Yue Opera is commonly called Shaoxing Opera, but its origin does not come from Shaoxing, but from Sheng County, which is adjacent to Shaoxing. If it is said to be Shaoxing Opera, then there are Luan Tan and Gao Qiang, which are the real Shaoxing Opera. The currently popular Yue Opera, that is, what is commonly called "Di Du Ban," is only performed in the Zhuji and Sheng County areas. It is entirely a form of popular entertainment during the agricultural off-season. The reason why the plot is called "Di Du Ban" is because it only uses two very simple musical instruments: the clapper board and the Di drum.</p>
<p>Yue Opera only has a history of thirty years. It was originally a popular local song and ditty. In the early years of the Republic of China, someone adapted it, gathered a few like-minded people, temporarily set up a stage, and performed it hastily. Although it was very simple and crude, it was quite popular among the local farmers, and thus became a small opera popular in one area. It was indispensable for paying tribute to the gods and enlivening the celebrations. Because the plot is simple and does not require many people, it is very suitable for mobile performances. They perform outside during the agricultural off-season, after the cold winter, and before Qingming Festival. In the early years, it only cost three or five yuan to perform for a whole night. Sometimes, even just providing a meal was enough.</p>
<p>The Lyrics Are Very Simple</p>
<p>Most of the earliest Yue Opera were adapted from mountain songs and ditties, and inevitably contained obscene content, so they were forbidden by the authorities. However, the countryside was far away, and the officials' eyes and ears were not comprehensive. The forbidding officials forbade, and the performers performed. Later, there were more and more performance opportunities, and many new scripts were written. They could not escape the cliches of "private engagement in the back garden, and the fallen young master becoming the top scholar." The erotic connotation was quite strong, and this was precisely why it could cater to the tastes of many people.</p>
<p>The lyrics of Yue Opera are very simple, usually in two forms: seven-character and ten-character, which are very similar to storytelling (Tan Ci), and may have been adapted from storytelling. When singing, the lengthy coda, "Ha ah ha ah," is dragged on for more than a dozen times. This is a style inherited from the Gao Qiang troupes. Because in the earliest days, in addition to the clapper board and the Di drum for keeping time, there was no musical instrument accompaniment. The actors took the opportunity to rest, so they had to use human voices to replace the interludes. As for the musical aspect, it is much more complex than before. In addition to the original drum and clapper, there is also string accompaniment, and the Huqin (two-stringed fiddle) has become an indispensable instrument. At the same time, many new tunes have been added, and Yue Opera is no longer so shabby.</p>
<p>All-Female Cast</p>
<p>In the early years, Yue Opera performances were not limited to women. Probably many poor families, affected by the decline of the countryside, contacted their daughters, between the ages of twelve and seventeen or eighteen, taught them to act, performed in nearby villages, and then went out to do business. However, there were still many men in the troupe. However, women acting could better cater to the audience's psychology. As far as men were concerned, they knew that they were women. As far as women were concerned, they regarded them as men. Therefore, women took precedence, and today Yue Opera is an all-female cast. Since Yue Opera is popular, many people follow suit. In Sheng County alone, there are about seventy or eighty troupes. Many places nearby also invite teachers from Sheng County to teach opera, so there are not few who form troupes. Over time, Yue Opera is no longer the exclusive domain of the people of Sheng County.</p>
<p>It only took ten years for Yue Opera to go from a makeshift stage to a teahouse to a theater. I don't know what good fortune it had, but it surprisingly rose three levels at once. Before the war, although Yue Opera was not included in the programs of amusement parks in Shanghai, it was called Shaoxing Wen Opera, but it did not attract much attention. The few "Di Du Ban" opera houses in the Zhabei Xinjiang Road Haining Road area also performed and stopped from time to time due to government intervention. The "New Drama Examination" published in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) did not include Yue Opera lyrics, which shows that it was still unknown. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, its influence extended to theaters, thus laying its solid foundation.</p>
<p>The Support of the Nouveau Riche</p>
<p>The main reason why Yue Opera was able to rise from the ground is that the plot is popular and caters to the audience. In particular, the nouveau riche who have made a fortune from the national crisis want to enjoy some entertainment, but they cannot understand art that is too profound. Only this kind of local opera is most suitable for their tastes. At the same time, Yue Opera stories mostly tell about love affairs between men and women, full of erotic connotations, and are performed by women, which can further satisfy their desires. Yue Opera has received a lot of support from this group of nouveau riche. Yue Opera itself, like the nouveau riche, suddenly flourished.</p>
<p>But then again, relying solely on the one-sided support of the audience cannot last. The reason why Yue Opera has what it is today is also due to the efforts of practitioners to constantly improve. In terms of clothing, it takes Peking Opera as a model in every way. The music has gradually changed from simple to complex. The gongs and drums are beaten, and the string instruments are accompanied. In terms of acting skills, they try their best to figure out the psychology of the characters in the play. There are also many newly written scripts, which are completely free from the constraints of old scripts. They have put a lot of effort into the art, and their progress is naturally unmatched by other local operas. Recently, they have also used the techniques of spoken drama, such as scenery and lighting, and even facial expressions and movements, and studied them in every way. The newly written "Xianglin's Wife" is an extraordinary work among many Yue Operas, thus greatly increasing the value of Yue Opera. The actors of Yue Opera, under the banner of reform, are marching towards a bright future. Now, in terms of "quality," "quantity," and "decoration," it has undergone a complete transformation, and the number of people who love it is of course more than before.</p>
<p>Gradually Reducing the Past Glory</p>
<p>At its peak, there were as many as thirty Yue Opera theaters in Shanghai, making Peking Opera, which has a long history, and spoken drama, which has a cultural mission, look at it with admiration. Yue Opera has indeed risen from the small villages of eastern Zhejiang, its active traces spreading throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The areas of Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo are adjacent to each other and have long been spread. Recently, even the areas of southern Jiangsu, Suzhou and Changzhou have become their territory. The tens of thousands of audiences in Shanghai are no longer just people from the south of the Yangtze River. Judging from its popularity, it is indeed worthy of looking down on everything, but things in the world are cyclical. When things reach their peak, they must decline. Yue Opera troupes call for "reform," but the so-called reform, which is truly up to standard, has a very miserable box office. This is something that people cannot figure out. The general Yue Opera theaters are also gradually reducing their former glory, and the talk of closing down is brewing everywhere. It can be seen that Yue Opera has begun to restrain its brilliance of the past few years, and there is a danger of going downhill.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Yarn Control Committee and Various Cotton Mills Discuss the Calculation Ratio of Cotton Yarn. The Last Allocation of Yarn Will Be Distributed Today.</h3>
<p>The measures and prices for the Cotton Yarn Control Committee's purchase of half of the yarn and cloth produced by the yarn mills in the Shanghai urban area have been approved by President Song. The committee is actively preparing for the purchase and drafting detailed rules. Once the committee meeting this week approves it, it can be implemented. Yesterday afternoon, the Business Department of the committee specially invited representatives of state-owned and private yarn mills, Wang Qiyu, Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, etc., to discuss the re-determination of the calculation ratio of cotton yarn counts and the grading of export materials of various factories, and exchanged opinions. It is heard that an agreement has been reached and will be approved together at the committee meeting.</p>
<p>In addition, the last allocation of yarn by the Cotton Textile Industry Association is scheduled to be distributed today. The allocated price is 1.975 million yuan per piece of 20-count yarn. The calculation ratio of yarn counts remains the same.</p>
<p>Yang Yinpu Talks About Stock Exchange: New Plans Are Being Drafted. Enemy and Puppet Property and Foreign Stock Can Generally Be Listed This Year.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A reporter visited the famous economist Yang Yinpu yesterday to inquire about various issues. He kindly answered them as follows: (1) What are your opinions on the method of re-evaluating the assets of industrial and commercial enterprises? Mr. Yang believes that the promulgation of these measures is the most wise measure taken by the government in recent years. In the past, the biggest trouble for general industrial and commercial enterprises was that the value of fixed assets could not be balanced with the working capital. After the government announced this measure, it is tantamount to opening up a long-term source of funds for industrial and commercial enterprises, enabling floating capital to join the production work. Its significance is far greater than providing temporary production loans. In the future, industrial and commercial enterprises can smoothly increase capital and will no longer be threatened by high interest rates. Probably when the business community closes accounts at the end of the lunar year, they will be able to feel the good effects of this move. Mr. Yang believes that this one-fifth of cash capital increase is necessary. Otherwise, shareholders will only take more stocks because of this new measure, and the capital of the business they operate will not increase at all. (2) What new plans does the Stock Exchange have this year? New plans are being drafted. Within this year, the stocks of some enemy and puppet property and foreign stock can generally be listed. The current stock prices are stable, which is a good phenomenon. The announcement of the asset revaluation method will have a new impact on stock market prices in the long run. (3) In the current economic situation, is it appropriate to adopt a tight credit policy? Answer: In the past three or four years during the War of Resistance Against Japan, there was a shortage of materials and currency inflation. Therefore, I advocated a tight credit policy at that time. However, when market interest rates are very high and prices are relatively stable, a tight credit policy will make industrial and commercial enterprises suffer from high interest rates. In summary, whether this policy is correct should be determined by the actual situation. (4) What are your views on this year's finances? Politics and economics are inseparable, and it is difficult to make predictions at this time. However, I personally believe that the government has a well-thought-out plan for increasing revenue. For example, the period originally set for the state-run China Textile Corporation was two years, but it is now coming to an end. If the government sells its shares when necessary, the income will be amazing. As for the reform of the monetary system, I personally believe that it is not yet the time, because the factors that make the currency value unstable have not yet been eliminated.</p>
<h3>Prices Rise Again; The Social Bureau Sends Staff to Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau made every effort to suppress the soaring prices at the end of last year, the price surge was slightly curbed. Unexpectedly, since the new year, due to the approaching lunar New Year and the increased needs of the people, unscrupulous merchants have become active again, so prices have fluctuated again in recent days, especially the price of rice, which has risen sharply. Taking the previous lessons as a warning, the Municipal Social Bureau decided to mobilize all the staff of the Price Management Section to go to various markets to be responsible for monitoring transactions in order to ensure that the people can safely spend the New Year. According to the person in charge of the Economic Administration Department of the bureau, the authorities have the greatest determination to suppress prices in the city and have repeatedly reiterated previous orders. Although the Gregorian New Year has been safely spent, the future of the lunar New Year is uncertain. It is hoped that the citizens will abide by the government's policy of suppressing prices and not violate it in any way, so as to work together to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<h3>Hongxiang Money Exchange Reopens</h3>
<p>Hongxiang Money Exchange was one of the Shanghai remittance money exchanges before the war. It has now been approved by the Ministry of Finance and will reopen on January 6. The general manager, Feng Zuozhou, is the son of Mr. Feng Shouzhi, a senior figure in the financial world. His knowledge and experience are very rich and appropriate. The manager, Luo Wenji, the deputy manager, Wu Weibin, and the assistant manager, Qin Qiuru, are all well-known figures in the financial world.</p>
<h3>Remittance Evasion is Astonishing</h3>
<p>Reaching 10 Million US Dollars per Month</p>
<p>Overseas remittances, which are related to the balance of international payments, have been decreasing in recent months. As of recently, the trend of overseas remittance evasion has become increasingly rampant. According to investigations by relevant parties, the amount of overseas remittances evaded between Hong Kong and Guangzhou reaches 10 million US dollars per month, which is a shocking figure. According to the Bank of China's report, the monthly overseas remittance income used to be 5 million US dollars, but now it is only about 2 million, a difference of three-fifths. The reason for the evasion is nothing more than the impact of foreign exchange problems. The official exchange rate set by the government is 3350, while the black market is as high as 6000. The official rate is too low, and the black market is too high. This is the biggest factor in overseas remittance evasion. As for the evasion methods, they are entrusted to US dollar drafts and Hong Kong dollars. The first type of US dollar draft was originally used by A town in the United States to remit to B town. Merchants can purchase it and send it to the United States to pay for goods. The second type of Hong Kong dollar draft can be collected in cash in Hong Kong. The Bank of China is actively discussing with the Central Bank to save overseas remittance evasion. President Bei's visit to Hong Kong this time is also related to this issue.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Industry Requests Loans; None Have Been Approved</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the pharmaceutical industry: (1) The industry's loans are currently being applied for individually, but because the restrictions are quite strict, the procedures are complicated, and many banks are unwilling to handle them. Therefore, as of now, only 12 companies have applied, and the amount of loans applied for is only about 5 billion. However, no one has been approved so far. Although the entire pharmaceutical industry has safely passed the Gregorian New Year, if the government does not provide rapid relief, at least half of the members will go bankrupt or stranded during the lunar New Year. Therefore, the future of the pharmaceutical industry is still not optimistic. (2) In the past, the association has submitted requests to the Health Bureau, the Materials Supply Bureau, and the Import Management Committee, etc., to bundle sales of domestically produced Western medicines and to restrict and prohibit the import of foreign goods, but they have not yet been approved. In addition to strictly regulating itself and stepping up the transformation of its products in order to seek self-reliance, the industry is very disappointed that the requirements submitted to the above bureaus and committees have been shelved.</p>
<h3>Japanese Businesses Allowed to Communicate Abroad; Foreign Trade Begins to Recover</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Picard, a trade expert at the Allied Supreme Commander's Headquarters, said that under the newly promulgated postal regulations in Japan, Japanese importers and exporters may begin to lay the foundation for restoring peacetime trade, but they still cannot directly sell goods or sign shipping contracts, because Japan's foreign trade still adopts the position of direct transactions between governments. After the wartime postal regulations were relaxed, Japanese businesses were allowed to exchange commercial letters with foreign businesses, but these letters must be inspected, and their content is limited to the following: (1) the size, style, and color of exportable goods; (2) inquiries about the sales of pre-war exports and new products; (3) the approximate quantity of manufactured goods available for export. In the future, Japanese businesses can open up foreign markets through communication, but they must apply to the Japanese Trade Bureau for an export permit. After being approved by the Allied Supreme Commander's Headquarters, the Trade Bureau will purchase the required export goods from the merchant in Japanese yen and then handle the export procedures between governments as usual. Mr. Picard said that the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the currencies of various countries has not yet been determined, so Japanese businesses and foreign businesses should not discuss prices. Although communication regarding imports is allowed, it is not very helpful at present, because the available funds are limited to the raw materials that Japan needs most, and the import of raw materials will be handled directly by the Allied Commander's Headquarters in contact with foreign commercial institutions. Although the resumption of communication between Japanese businesses and foreign businesses is an important step in the restoration of Japanese foreign trade to private trade, and it can expand the scope of future trade.</p>
<h3>Bankruptcy Statistics: A Total of 1,200 Companies Bankrupted Last Year, with Pharmaceutical Factories Accounting for the Most</h3>
<p>The various industries in the city were not very prosperous last year. As of the end of the Gregorian calendar year, it is known that a total of more than 1,200 shops and factories went bankrupt in the city. Among them, the pharmaceutical industry accounted for the most. There are more than 300 pharmaceutical companies in the city, and as many as 225 went bankrupt. In the financial sector, a total of 21 went bankrupt. The number of bankruptcies in other industries is also countless. It is estimated that a total of more than 1,200 companies went bankrupt or were liquidated in the city.</p>
<h3>High Costs Lead to Few Exports</h3>
<p>A reporter recently learned from export merchants that since the implementation of reasonable control over import and export trade, the current foreign exchange rate in our country will generally not change temporarily. Although import merchants benefit from it, those engaged in export trade feel deeply distressed. After the war, all countries, especially those from the begining: raw silk, tea, tung oil, silk, embroidery, porcelain, fur, carpets, etc., are in great demand. Inquiries from overseas are enthusiastic, but exporters mostly lose money, and the prices are too high, and they cannot make a deal, so it is a pity that the great international market has not been won. The crux of the problem lies in the fact that the exporter must sell the foreign exchange earnings obtained from the sale of goods to the Central Bank at the official price. The loss in this is huge. If exporters were allowed to freely sell foreign exchange to importers or others who need it, then our country's products could compete with other countries in the foreign market.</p>
<h3>Nanchang's Finance Remains Tight</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanchang, 5th] The Nanchang market after the New Year has not slightly reduced the appearance of financial tightening. The prices of various goods fluctuate irregularly due to this reason, either rising or falling. Foreign yarns and gold rise with the New Year, each rising by tens of thousands: 20-count Golden Star (241) million, finished gold goes in at 3.4 million, comes out at 3.8 million. Grain and oils prices are weaker because there is stronger source: tea oil is 105,000 and raw oil is 96,000. Goods from the south increase in price due to the active sales from the lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Good News for the Silk Industry: Sino-American Corporation Accepts Commission to Purchase Our Country's Silk</h3>
<p>Since General Chennault retired from the military, he has been engaged in commercial activities. In addition to establishing an air transport squadron and signing a contract with the Executive Yuan, he also organized the Sino-American Corporation to engage in import and export trade. It is now known that the Sino-American Corporation has recently accepted a commission from an American importer to order a large batch of silk in our country. Therefore, Chen has sent someone to discuss with the silk weaving industry in Shanghai. The silk weaving merchants did not dare to accept it rashly due to the raw material supply problem. Later, the Central Trust Bureau agreed to purchase all the raw silk and allocate it as much as possible. The raw material problem is generally solved. Therefore, after the quantity and pattern required by the Sino-American Corporation are issued, the two parties can sign a contract. It is heard that the quantity ordered by the United States is very considerable. In the midst of the silk industry's precarious voice, it is also good news that a large number of exports can be made.</p>
<h3>The United States Needs Far Eastern Products to Maintain Current Production</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Paul, Director of the International Trade Department of the US Department of Commerce, issued a statement tonight: If the current production volume in the United States continues to be maintained, the amount of products from Far Eastern countries that the United States will need in 1947 will be larger. Mr. Paul said that if the United States wants to maintain its foreign trade, it must reduce its high tariffs in 1947 as an exchange condition for concessions from other countries. Mr. Paul continued: "The total exports of the United States in 1947 may exceed 11 billion yuan. If the United States continues to maintain its current industrial production volume, the amount of raw materials and manufactured products from Europe, Latin America, and Far Eastern countries that the United States will need in 1947 will be larger than in the past.</p>
<h3>American Textile Export Association Advocates Amending Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The Textile Export Association recently suggested to the United States Tariff Commission that the current tariff rates of the United States on Cuba, China, Lebanon, and Norway should be frozen and promote commerce with countries that have large gold pound surpluses. Regarding the forthcoming reciprocal trade agreement, the association advocates that the US government should resolutely amend the preferential agreement so that American textile exporters can compete with Lancashire on an equal footing in the British market.</p>
<h3>Japan's Compensation Materials to China Will Be Offset by Machinery and Industry. The Caustic Soda Factory Will Be Dismantled and Relocated Soon.</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Reliable sources say that among the industrial materials that Japan will compensate to China, steel industry machinery and caustic soda industrial equipment are the most numerous. After this batch of equipment is transported to China, it will be received by state-owned and private industries under certain conditions. Relevant people pointed out that China's future caustic soda factories will be densely distributed on the coastline from Qinhuangdao in the north to Hainan Island in the south. It is also heard that among the caustic soda industrial equipment transported to China by Japan, the largest factory has a total of three. One of them has been applied for by a large chemical giant in the city. The difficulty lies in the transportation and the large amount of working capital required for use, which needs the full assistance of the government.</p>
<h3>Northeast Economic Trends (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>While the "currency collapse" is fiercely sweeping across Beijing and Shanghai, the Northeast is also facing an economic crisis. As the year thirty-six begins, the crisis is intensifying. Since everyone recognizes the Northeast as China's lifeline, the critical question is how to rescue the Northeast's economy, to save the Northeast, and to save ourselves. The first task is to clearly understand the current economic situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The current problem in the Northeast is that heavy industry is struggling to recover, the economy is on the verge of exhaustion, and the only agricultural products it relies on—soybeans and sorghum—have no outlet due to transportation difficulties, leaving everything without a solution. The "Trade Problem Symposium" recently held by the Shenyang Heping Daily newspaper社 reveals some general information through the words of some participating economic experts.</p>
<p>Industrial and Mining Crisis</p>
<p>Xie Shuying, Director of the Northeast Office of the Fee Committee and Director of the Fushun Coal Mine, said: The Northeast's industry and mining are currently facing a crisis. The period between March and April of this year will be the most critical stage. If a reasonable solution is not sought, it will fall into an unthinkable situation.</p>
<p>Taking Fushun coal as an example, the lack of equipment and the shortage of technical personnel are the most serious problems. Currently, many mines have excessive water accumulation, and there is a great shortage of water pumps. Other accessories were mostly dilapidated and unusable when received, which naturally affects production. Other essential equipment for coal mines, such as transportation belts, timber, and supports, are also desperately lacking. If they cannot be replenished by March or April of this year, and the water cannot be pumped out of the mines, they will inevitably be flooded.</p>
<p>Exporting minerals from the Northeast was not originally difficult. Electricity and coal are the driving forces behind all light and heavy industries. As long as electricity and coal are not a problem, other heavy industries such as steel and light industries such as papermaking and chemicals can gradually prosper. After prosperity, the development of export trade is imaginable.</p>
<p>At the same time, the exchange of goods between inside and outside the customs can also be smoothly promoted. A large amount of equipment and daily necessities can be transported from inside the customs, while coal and steel can be transported from outside the customs. Under reasonable conditions, it is estimated that five million tons of coal can be transported out this year. In short, everything should be planned and managed holistically to achieve rationalization.</p>
<p>B said of Steel: American steel has already arrived in Shanghai, and the current price is even cheaper than ours inside the customs. What trade are we talking about? If the government does not make a major decision this year to formulate a policy to revive industry and mining in the Northeast, then there will only be failure. Therefore, in addition to investing heavily to supplement equipment, the authorities should also solve the problem of production and sales, which is also decisive for the Northeast's foreign trade.</p>
<p>In short, this year can be said to be a stage for the reorganization of industry and mining in the Northeast, and whether foreign trade can be promoted must also be laid on this year.</p>
<p>Cheap Grain Hurts Farmers</p>
<p>Jin Enqi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and Chairman of the Shenyang Chamber of Commerce, said: Recently, grain prices have generally fallen, and "cheap grain hurts farmers," which is not a good phenomenon. For example, recently many farmers who have been allocated small collective agricultural land are asking to return the land to landlords because last year's harvest cannot sustain them until this year's planting. The market prices of soybeans, cotton, and sorghum are too low, and the rural areas have no purchasing power, which cannot be solved unless large-scale trade is possible. Otherwise, the production of small-scale daily necessities will also be impossible to develop. Currently, coal prices are high and sales are sluggish, and grain prices are low, so many people are using soybeans as fuel, which is especially regrettable to mention.</p>
<p>Wang Nianzu, Deputy Director of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Northeast Headquarters Economic Commission, stated: When talking about soybeans, we must talk about the issue of soybean exports. Mr. Wang said: "Soybean exports were less than two million tons when Japan controlled the Northeast, and sorghum was only over one million tons, followed by miscellaneous grains. Regarding food, when the Japanese controlled the Northeast, they used financial policies to purchase food seeds, and one-third of the money released always circulated outside.</p>
<p>Now, due to the difficulty of technical personnel and the high risk, when no one buys large quantities of food, only the government can buy it to release it when there is a shortage of new and old crops. The Economic Commission has planned to handle large-scale purchases, hoping that soybean exports can reach about 500,000 tons this year. About 10,000 tons of soybeans have been exported to inside the customs, and less to outside the customs. Recently, preparations have been made to export 20,000 tons. Currently, there is no way to dispatch vehicles. The fact is that there are few vehicles, many military transports, and the railways that were destroyed by the communist army have mostly changed from double tracks to single tracks, so transportation is indeed a difficult problem at present.</p>
<p>The Sadness of Soybeans</p>
<p>Zhang Youjiang, Deputy Director of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Northeast Headquarters Economic Commission, stated that realistically speaking, the main product of the Northeast is soybeans. According to a survey, the soybean production in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Andong, and Liaobei, the amount sold on the market in the 31st year of the Republic of China was 292,425 metric tons. This year, the production in the recovered areas of the four provinces is 8,034,000 metric tons. The research results show that assuming the population in the recovered areas of the four provinces is 20 million (actually more), each person needs four jin of soybean oil and fifty jin of soybeans per year, then the total amount needed is 500,000 metric tons. Then the exportable amount of soybeans is 200,000 metric tons, plus the existing 150,000 metric tons, the maximum exportable amount is 450,000 metric tons.</p>
<p>If all are exported, calculated at the current market price of ten yuan per jin, 9 billion circulating coupons can flow in. Therefore, promoting soybean exports is the most important and urgent task today, which is closely related to the economic prosperity of the Northeast.</p>
<p>In fact, exporting soybeans is not a difficult task, but the difficulty lies in the fact that 450,000 metric tons of soybeans are not easy to transport out, because the current price will hinder production, and the other is the difficulty of transportation. At the same time, the Northeast originally had a trade surplus, so there should be some concerns. However, regardless of whether there is a trade surplus inside and outside the customs, looking at the current situation, this amount can always help the construction of industry and agriculture in the Northeast, so the development of trade in the Northeast is the bridge to the construction of the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Japanese built the Northeast mostly with the Northeast's own money, which can be verified by figures. Among them, 60-70% of the construction funds relied on the Northeast's export trade, and on average, more than 80% relied on internal funds in the Northeast, so the Northeast's export trade itself is great and the foundation is very solid.</p>
<p>Supporting Trade</p>
<p>Cao Liying, Deputy Director of the Northeast Office of the Resources Committee, said: The current economy of the Northeast is like a "half-dead horse," in a state of half-life and half-death. As long as the export figures are sufficient, the trade business in the Northeast can naturally develop normally. Japan always had a trade surplus when implementing the trade control policy in the Northeast. In its composition, the proportion of industry and mining increased year by year compared to agricultural products. Therefore, in the era of Japanese control, the proportion of industry and mining was getting higher and higher, and now the production quantity of agricultural products is large, while the quantity of industrial and mining products is negligible. Therefore, we should consider the export priority order. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Current State of World Cotton Fabric Panic</h3>
<p>— Rhyme Translation</p>
<p>Although many countries in the world have surplus cotton, cotton fabric weaving is still a crucial issue at present.</p>
<p>Although this year has passed, the panic over cotton fabric clothing in the world will still carry over from this year to next year in many countries. Looking at the global situation as a whole, there is no sign that this shortage will end.</p>
<p>Of course, the situation will eventually improve. However, regardless of the surplus of cotton in the United States and other countries now, the supply of shirts, casual wear, work clothes, and robes will continue to be scarce. Increasing the production of cotton fabrics is the most crucial issue at present.</p>
<p>The cotton textile industries of various countries in the world are now increasing production, but due to the lack of labor and coal, the scarcity of machines, and various economic dislocations caused by the war, the full recovery of productivity has been slow to achieve.</p>
<p>Before the war, Japan's cotton textile exports accounted for 40% of the world's total. The fact that the Allied countries have been unable to reach an agreement on how to deal with the country's textile industry for a long time is one of the factors that have created the world cotton fabric panic. Although the recovery efforts within Germany and Japan have been greatly delayed by various disputes, they are still continuing to restore the production of the textile industry to supply the newly liberated countries of Europe and Asia. However, as of November 1946, neither country has been able to export products.</p>
<p>Lack of Situation</p>
<p>The degree of cotton textile shortages varies from place to place around the world. In the United Kingdom, the rationing system is still strictly enforced, and the average Briton can only buy half of what he bought before the war. The situation in France is much worse than in the United Kingdom. As for other countries in Europe, the shortage has reached the point where housewives are even cutting up bed sheets, curtains, and tablecloths to make clothes to replace their tattered old outfits.</p>
<p>The situation in Latin American countries is relatively better, and these countries' cotton textile imports have increased by 50% compared to before the war. The consumption of cotton textiles in the United States has also returned to pre-war levels. Stimulated by factors such as full employment, increased income, and the demobilization of soldiers, the consumption of cotton textiles in the United States has increased by at least 50% compared to before the war.</p>
<p>The 170 million people in Southeast Asia are most severely oppressed by the clothing panic. They can only get a quarter of the cotton fabric they need. Therefore, they even refuse to work unless they are paid in clothing. The production of raw materials such as rubber, tin, copra, sugar, ramie, and oils, which are extremely important for the industrial recovery of Western countries, is indirectly affected. The production of rice urgently needed in the famine areas of China and India has also decreased as a result.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation in the world, excluding the United States and former Axis countries, the average amount of cotton textiles that countries can obtain is only three-quarters of what it was before the war.</p>
<p>Production Increase Plan</p>
<p>Countries that already produce cotton fabrics are planning to distribute existing products evenly to areas in the world that are feeling the shortage through the Textile Construction Committee, which was formed during the war. The total amount of cotton textile exports from various countries in the world in the first half of this year was about 100 million yards, which is nearly one-third less than the pre-war level. Among them, the United States, which has the largest export volume in the world today, accounts for 400 million yards, accounting for a quarter of the country's total production.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom exported 250 million yards, accounting for 30% of its total exports. Other cotton textile exporting countries include India, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada.</p>
<p>At present, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries have begun to export cotton textiles. Some officials in the United States believe that the products of the above countries, coupled with the products supplied by the United States to Germany and Japan for manufacturing, can supply a total of 2 billion yards to countries in urgent need of cotton fabrics in the first half of 1947.</p>
<p>Many Difficulties</p>
<p>However, the obstacles in front of this 2 billion yard cotton fabric production increase plan are very large. Japan, which is expected to supply 500 million yards of fabric (this number is about 40% of the country's pre-war cotton fabric exports), is still in the early stages of its domestic cotton textile industry's recovery. The export volume in August 1946 was only 17 million yards, and the lack of food and coal is likely to reduce its export volume to less than half of what we expected.</p>
<p>The cotton textile industry in Europe is also facing a very serious shortage of labor and coal, and it will inevitably be very difficult to increase production as a result.</p>
<p>Moreover, the implementation of political pressure by various European countries and the United States will inevitably lead to the large-scale cotton fabrics being used for domestic consumption, even if the increase in cotton fabric production can be achieved as planned. If price controls in the United States are lifted, its export volume will be greatly reduced, and the International Textile Construction Committee will be on the verge of bankruptcy as a result. Under such circumstances, international trade competition will inevitably replace the principle of distribution based on needs. Under the principle of free trade, countries that are already wearing beautiful clothes, such as the United States and Latin American countries, are in the most advantageous position because they have money. The countries in Europe and Asia that have been liberated from the hands of the enemy will be able to obtain even less cotton fabric than they do now.</p>
<p>Future Prospects</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, a trend is already obvious: If the international distribution system is indeed abolished next year, the supply of cotton fabrics in a few countries will indeed improve, but the situation in areas where cotton fabrics are most urgently needed will be even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the planned total of 2 billion yards of cotton fabrics from various countries in the world can be achieved as scheduled, and the distribution system can be maintained at the same time, then the total amount of cotton fabrics needed by countries feeling the clothing panic in the world, 225 million yards, can be fully supplied in the second half of 1947.</p>
<p>However, even if this situation is achieved, the complete end of the cotton textile panic is still far away. The total export volume of cotton fabrics from various cotton-producing countries must be increased to 325 million yards every six months to be comparable to the pre-war level. And in recent years, the needs of various countries in the world have certainly increased greatly.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that unless a serious economic depression strikes and greatly reduces people's purchasing power, the shelves stacked with cotton fabrics in some areas of the world will remain empty for a long period of time in the future.

<h3>Ministry of Education Prepares to Revise Regulations for the Establishment of Private Middle Schools to Increase Funds and Prevent Malpractices</h3>
<p>(Reported from Nanjing on the 5th by this newspaper) The establishment of a private middle school should first organize a board of directors and submit an application for establishment. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education revised the pre-war regulations for private middle schools. First, regarding assets (such as school buildings and equipment), there must be actual buildings and equipment. Second, regarding funds, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the funds should be deposited in a bank to generate interest, which is sufficient to maintain the school's operating expenses in principle. Due to different prices in different regions, it was not possible to stipulate a uniform standard amount. However, educational bureaus in each province and city were ordered to stipulate a standard amount based on the actual situation of the local area and report it to the Ministry of Education for record. Recently, the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau stipulated that the minimum fund for a private junior middle school is 20 million yuan, and the amount for a senior middle school will be appropriately increased. The situation in other provinces and cities is very inconsistent. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is preparing to revise the regulations for the establishment of private middle schools this year. In order to prevent malpractices, the fund item will be increased.</p>
<h3>The Distribution Method of Educational Recovery Funds in the Northeast Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th) The 500 million yuan in circulating coupons for Northeast Educational Recovery Funds, which had been approved by the Executive Yuan, has been discussed by all relevant parties in the education sector here. It has been decided that, according to the instructions from the Ministry of Education, one-tenth of the total amount, or 50 million yuan, will be reserved for emergency reconstruction when provinces and cities in the unrecovered areas are taken over. Of the remaining 450 million yuan, Liaoning will receive 150 million yuan, Jilin 85 million yuan, Andong and Liaobei 70 million yuan each, Shenyang 60 million yuan, Changchun 30 million yuan, and Siping, Jilin, and Andong cities 15 million yuan each, and Songjiang and Linzhong 5 million yuan. In addition, the Northeast Headquarters decided to temporarily issue 70% of the allocated funds before the Ministry of Education has approved the figures.</p>
<h3>The Taiwan Provincial College of Law and Commerce Has Been Transferred to National Taiwan University</h3>
<p>(Reported from Taipei on the 5th by this newspaper) The Taiwan Provincial College of Law and Commerce has been transferred to National Taiwan University in accordance with the order, and the handover has been completed. The president will be temporarily replaced by Principal Lu.</p>
<h3>Personnel Who Passed the Higher Examination Are Allowed to Be Sent Abroad for Observation</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's reply to the Examination Yuan has been implemented by order.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th) The "Measures for the Executive Yuan's Ministries, Departments, and Provincial and Municipal Governments to Send Personnel Abroad for Observation or Internship" promulgated by the Executive Yuan stipulates that personnel for observation or internship must be graduates of specialized schools or above, and the qualifications of those who passed the higher examination are not included. The Examination Yuan believes that personnel who passed the higher examination have always been strictly selected according to the level of university graduates, and their knowledge is above that of university graduates. The national government promulgated the Regulations on the Selection and Sending of Civil Servants for Further Study and Observation, stipulating that the selection of personnel is limited to those who have passed the higher examination or graduated from specialized schools or above at home and abroad. In addition, the public-funded and self-funded study abroad examinations, and the dispatch of agricultural, industrial, and mining technicians for overseas internships last year, have all been evaluated and participated by personnel who passed the higher examination. After consultation with the Executive Yuan, before the aforementioned measures are revised, personnel who have passed the higher examination and meet other conditions are allowed to be sent abroad for observation or internship, and they are requested to add the qualifications of those who have passed the higher examination when revising the measures. The Executive Yuan has now replied to do so and has been ordered to implement it.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Will Select Geological Researchers to Be Sent Abroad</h3>
<p>(Aviation News from Nanjing by this newspaper) Geologist Li Siguang recently received a letter from Professor Goldschmidt, hoping that our country would send three students (one each in physics, chemistry, and geology) to the practical training room he runs. However, all three must have done preliminary research work, and one of them must fully understand and be able to speak English or French. Mr. Li has forwarded this intention to the Ministry of Education. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has sent a letter to the Academia Sinica to recommend more than twice the number of candidates and submit research reports in order to determine the candidates.</p>
<h3>The Shenyang Municipal Government Trains Teachers of National Schools</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th) In order to adapt to the special situation in the Northeast, the Municipal Government has specially formed the Shenyang Municipal National School Teacher Training Class.

<h3>Refugee Students Cannot Afford Tuition Fees and Are Petitioning the Ministry of Education Today</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The Shanghai Refugee Student Association, in view of the fact that tuition fees for private colleges and universities in the next semester will be as high as 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, which is really unbearable, has specially sent representatives Yang Hanxun, Yang Peilin, and Qin Bangnan to Beijing today (6th) to petition the Ministry of Education, putting forward three specific requirements: (1) Please exempt refugee students from tuition fees in various colleges and universities in accordance with the clear order of the Ministry of Education. (2) Please quickly issue public funds to refugee students in various private colleges and universities in accordance with the order of the Ministry. (3) Please the Ministry of Education solve the accommodation problem for refugee students. The association also entertained the press yesterday (5th) afternoon, explaining that the hometowns of refugee students in various colleges and universities are mostly in civil war areas, and the source of income is difficult. If the authorities sit idly by and do not provide relief, more than a thousand people will lose their studies and become homeless. According to the association, there are students from Henan and Shandong, and the most are from northern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou School Teachers Borrow Salaries, and the Education Department Has Agreed to Lend One Month's Salary</h3>
<p>(Reported from Hangzhou on the 5th by this newspaper) Regarding the Hangzhou Provincial School Education's borrowing of salaries and strikes, it is reported that the Education Department has expressed that it has agreed to lend one month's salary, so the teachers will not insist on striking.</p>
<h3>There Is a Surplus of High School Teachers in One District of Shanghai, According to Counselor Dan Yin of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Dan Yinmou, Counselor of the Ministry of Education, was previously sent to Shanghai to inspect various specialized schools and above. The inspection period has now ended. According to Mr. Dan, at a time when the whole country feels a shortage of teachers, the Shanghai area is an exception. Not only does it not feel a lack, but it also feels a surplus. For example, Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Daxia University, and others who have been reinstated have moved from the mainland to Shanghai, and the number of people has increased sharply, especially Jiaotong University, where the number of teachers exceeds the budget by 135 people.</p>
<h3>Ma Sicong Is Responsible for Preparing for the Art Department of Zhongshan College</h3>
<p>(Reported from Guangzhou on the 5th by this newspaper) Famous musician Ma Sizong has recently been hired by the Teachers College of Sun Yat-sen University to be responsible for preparing for the Art Department, which can be established during the summer vacation. Mr. Ma is scheduled to give a public performance in Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Held a New Year's Talk Yesterday, Attended by More Than Ninety Middle School Principals</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The Municipal Education Bureau convened the principals of public and private middle schools in the city at the Municipal Gezhi Middle School at 3 pm yesterday to hold a New Year's Talk. More than ninety people, including Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Jizhou, Gao Erbai, Jin Zhaojun, and Xu Wenxiang, attended. Director Gu Yuxiu and Deputy Director Li Ximou personally presided over the meeting. First, Director Gu gave a speech, briefly saying: The salaries of public employees have been ordered to be adjusted, and the treatment of teachers in public and private schools is close.</p>
<p>Efforts Are Made to Suppress the Fees of Private Schools</p>
<p>Regarding the funding of private schools, Director Gu said: The Education Bureau does not intend to impose rigid restrictions for the time being, but hopes that each school will make efforts to suppress it as much as possible, and it is best not to increase it. Director Gu also said: When the council decides on the fee standard, it is best to allow each school to have temporary remedial measures in case of particularly high price increases. However, the number of free places in each school must be increased to at least 20% of the total number of students in the school. If the number of students applying is less than this percentage, and the school can use the remaining tuition fees to add books and instruments, the Education Bureau can also allow it. Director Gu said that the new constitution stipulates that educational funding should not be less than 15% of the total budget at the central level, not less than 25% at the provincial level, and not less than 35% at the city and county level. He believes that such regulations are unprecedented in the constitutions of various countries in the world, which shows the importance our country attaches to education. The educational sector has a promising future and hopes that people in the educational sector will work together to promote its realization.</p>
<p>The University Strike Has Come to an End</p>
<p>As for the recent universities protesting the atrocities of the US military in Peiping, Director Gu emphasized that the remarks of Peking University President Hu Shi on this incident were the most appropriate, because the atrocities of one or two US soldiers are purely a legal issue and should not involve political issues. At the same time, they are also moral issues of individual behavior and cannot be blamed on the collective. Middle school students have their own correct understanding. At the end of the semester, middle school students should work harder on their own studies and avoid propaganda. He hopes to make rational judgments. After Director Gu finished his speech, Deputy Director Li continued to speak, saying: Universities such as Fudan and Tongji, which protested the atrocities of the US military in Peiping by striking, have resumed classes one after another. Jiaotong University will also officially start class today (5th), so this matter has come to an end.</p>
<p>The Bureau Will Reimburse Free Places Exceeding the Quota</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of tuition fees for private schools, Deputy Director Li also said: In the last semester, it was stipulated that elementary schools should charge 80,000 yuan, junior middle schools 120,000 yuan, and senior middle schools 160,000 yuan. It was also stipulated that 20% of the total number of students should be free, 25% for school recurring expenses, and the rest for teachers' salaries. However, many private schools did not follow the 20% free quota. In the next semester, it is hoped that each school will increase the number of free places as much as possible, so as not to cause any student to lose their studies due to increased tuition fees. If the number of applicants for free places exceeds 20%, the excess number will be reimbursed by the Education Bureau. Free places for children of civil servants are also hoped to be implemented seriously. In addition to the 20% full exemption resolved by the City Council, another 10% half exemption is required, and it is hoped that this will be gradually achieved in the future. After Deputy Director Li finished speaking, Director Gu asked the principals of each school present to freely express their opinions, and the meeting did not end until after 5 pm.</p>

<h3>One Powerful Kick Determines the Landscape – Donghua Defeats Qingbai Again Yesterday – Six Wins in Six Games, Championship in Sight</h3>
<p>In the second round of the Group A Football League, Donghua met Qingbai again. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and at 2:30 PM, the match proceeded as usual at Yiyuan. Fans flocked to the stadium, filling it to capacity, with an estimated crowd of over ten thousand people, marking a grand occasion for the new year. In a fierce contest, Donghua, thanks to Sun Tie-tui's free kick in the opening three minutes, scored a precious goal to defeat Qingbai again. This secured a glorious record of six wins in six games. The starting lineups for both sides yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen</p>
<p>Han Longbo, Fu Zhen, Yu Zhixing</p>
<p>Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Tie Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Qin Bigao</p>
<p>Yan Shi, Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Huang Zhendong, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Zhang Renyi, Li Yichen, Gu Yisha, Song Lingsheng, Jiang Qing</p>
<p>Donghua Breaks the Net Within Three Minutes</p>
<p>The match started on time, with referee Wu Shouheng and linesmen Chen Jixiang and Huang Renyi. Donghua kicked off, with all five forwards advancing. Meng Yiliang, eager to protect, handled the ball outside the twenty-yard box, resulting in a free kick for Ah Sun. With a powerful kick, the ball flew like an arrow, straight into the right corner. Qin Bigao was unable to save it. Donghua scored the opening goal, only three minutes into the game, prompting a continuous barrage of firecrackers from the crowd. Four minutes later, Zhang Lingen violently tackled Gu Yisha outside the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick for Qingbai. Yi Chen took the shot, but Lingen redeemed himself by clearing the ball with a header.</p>
<p>Qingbai's Counterattack Achieves Nothing</p>
<p>Qingbai's counterattack was fierce, but achieved nothing. Donghua attacked again. He Dai advanced down the center and made a brilliant pass to Longhai. Little Han dribbled deep and shot near the goal, but Bigao managed to catch the ball securely. Soon after, Shi Xin also committed a handball, and Youliang took a long shot, which Bigao pushed away, averting danger. Eighteen minutes into the game, Zhang Lingen and Renyi collided, and Lingen was injured and left the field, but soon returned. Around the twentieth minute, Ah Sun received a pass from the back, turned, and attempted an overhead kick. The stance was beautiful, but Bigao jumped up and caught it. Qingbai launched an all-out attack. Little Gu made a central breakthrough and shot over the crossbar. Thirty-nine minutes into the game, Qingbai's Huang Zhendong touched the ball with his hand outside the penalty area, resulting in a free kick. Ah Sun planned to repeat the old trick, taking a powerful shot. The ball was low and fast, heading straight for the goal, but Yan Shixin cleared the danger at the goal line. At the end of the first half, Donghua led by one goal.</p>
<p>No Gains in the Second Half</p>
<p>In the second half, both sides maintained the same lineups. Qingbai's Gao Baozheng committed a handball, and Ah Sun took three free kicks outside the penalty area. He selected Li Yao, who shot immediately, but Bigao caught the ball. Qingbai launched a counterattack, fierce in its approach, but all efforts were in vain. Twenty-one minutes in, Zhang Renyi lofted the ball in front of the goal, but Banglun reacted quickly and cleared the danger. Donghua launched an offensive, with Sun Tie-tui taking two shots, both flying over the crossbar. Ah Zai received a pass from Li Yao, jumped up, and headed the ball, but Bigao caught it again. Thirty-six minutes in, Qingbai's Gu Yisha and Jiang Qing charged forward, heading straight into the penalty area. Fortunately, Donghua's Zhuang Youren rushed back and saved the day. Afterwards, Qingbai's Jiang Qing left the field due to an injury. Forty-two minutes in, Ah Zhuang, overzealous, was also injured, leaving both sides with ten players. Shortly after, the game ended, with Donghua defeating Qingbai again by a score of 1-0.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Football Team</h3>

<h3>Correction from Reader</h3>
<p>Upon investigation, the Ministry of Education of our country is preparing to establish a popular library in Japan because the people of Japan urgently hope to understand the progress of all cultural and academic endeavors in our country since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, as well as the situation in various aspects of politics, economy, and society. The Ministry of Education, in view of the fact that the United States has already established an American popular library in the central district of Tokyo, which is exclusively for the use of the Japanese people and has been well received, and that the Soviet Union also has organizations such as the Soviet-Japanese Cultural Association to provide introductions, is considering establishing a Chinese popular library in Tokyo at the request of the Japanese people, in order to promote the spirit of resistance and cultural and academic progress of our country since the September 18th Incident, and to influence the thinking of the Japanese people. All books, magazines, etc. will be purchased and sent from within the country or donated by various academic institutions, rather than taken from our country's old books and antiques that were looted in the past and should now be returned to us. The news from Tokyo reported in your newspaper on December 6th has slight factual discrepancies. I hope you will make a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3>Outside Perimeter of Lushun and Dalian</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper's New Year's Day Airmail News from Shenyang, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Northeast China, Han Qingqing</p>
<p>On the eve of the government taking over Lushun and Dalian, and at a time when newspapers around the world are prominently reporting on Lushun and Dalian, it has aroused great attention and interest among the Chinese people. This is because the National Army is currently only active on the fringes of Dalian. At the same time, the entire past development of Lushun and Dalian is linked to the so-called "Kwantung Leased Territory" area. Today, it is necessary to introduce to everyone the political, economic, and construction situation of the enemy's "Kwantung Leased Territory," which is the actual outline of the core and surrounding areas of Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<p>This area is the tentacle of the Far Eastern Peninsula, standing on the tip of the southern end of the peninsula, with the Yellow Sea to the east and the Bohai Sea to the west. The tentacle extends to the center. Its scope includes the area from the vicinity of Chaoyang Temple north of Pulandian to the Biluo River area east of Piziwo, forming a line. All areas south of this line and nearby islands belong to it, totaling 3,462 square kilometers, forming the enemy's entry and exit point, its lifeline.</p>
<p>In this special area, there are undulating hills, a lack of flat land, and narrow river basins, without the convenience of water transportation. Along the Yellow Sea coast, there are many curved coastlines, with natural harbors like Dalian and Lushun. The wide and flat sandy beaches along the coast are suitable for salt production. The main islands include Wuyu and the Changshan Islands.</p>
<p>General Climate</p>
<p>The tentacle area is dominated by a maritime climate due to its terrain. At the same time, because it is close to the mainland, it is also affected by the continental climate. Winter lasts for about half a year, from November to April of the following year. Summer is also relatively long, often with a tendency to transition directly from winter to summer.</p>
<p>Near May, the heat is felt. From July to mid-August, it reaches its peak, but the temperature decreases in the morning and evening, and there is usually no suffering from the heat. In mid-September, the temperature drops, and the autumn scenery fills the sky. By November, everything presents a winter scene, and it is time for life around the stove.</p>
<p>July and August can be considered the rainy season, with rainfall accounting for half of the annual total. However, there are very few sudden rains and strong winds, with many sunny days and many hours of sunshine. There are few days with snowfall and snow accumulation. In addition, in the spring, there are continental cyclones that stir up sand and dust into the sky, forming a yellow dust phenomenon, which dims the sunlight and is an unpleasant time!</p>
<p>Administrative System</p>
<p>In the past, the administrative organization of the "Kwantung Leased Territory" consisted of the "Kwantung Bureau" and the "Kwantung Leased Territory Government." The bureau was located in the Japanese embassy in the puppet Manchukuo, and the office was located in Dalian City. The head of the Kwantung Bureau was the plenipotentiary ambassador to the puppet Manchukuo, supervised by the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, and handled the affairs of the Kwantung Bureau. The governor of the "Kwantung Leased Territory Government" was under the command of the Japanese ambassador and managed the administrative affairs of the Kwantung Leased Territory. According to his authority or special delegation, he had the power to issue orders to the commander of the army and navy and to request the use of military force.</p>
<p>The local autonomy system of the "Kwantung Leased Territory" was divided into two types: "city system" and "association system." The administrative districts within the territory were divided into two cities and sixty-four associations. Except for the city areas of Dalian and Lushun, the association system was implemented in all other areas. These were divided into four districts: Jinzhou, Pulandian, Piziwo, and Lushun. Each district had a civil affairs office, and the number of associations under its jurisdiction varied depending on the scope of the civil affairs office, with ten in Lushun, sixteen in Jinzhou, eighteen in Pulandian, and twenty in Piziwo.</p>
<p>Lushun and Dalian Shipping</p>
<p>Although the history of shipping in Lushun and Dalian is not long, the development of Japanese fleets within the territory has been truly astonishing. The external transportation of Lushun and Dalian took a turning point in 1906 when Dalian Port was converted into a free trade port. Because Dalian Port was used as an auxiliary port to Lushun, it handled the trade of special products of the puppet Manchukuo. At the same time, the South Manchuria Railway Company's management of the docks was successful, not only connecting with the Japanese mainland, Taiwan, the Chinese coast, and Southeast Asia, but also with Australia, India, Europe, and North America. After the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, in order to develop resources, various industries flourished, and ship traffic reached its peak. However, it was later greatly influenced by ships from Britain, France, and Germany. After the establishment of the Dalian Steamship Company, a special unit of the South Manchuria Railway, in 1915, it became the third largest fleet in Japan. With the increase in other ships in the "Kwantung Leased Territory," it gained an important position in East Asian maritime transport.</p>
<p>During the September 18th Incident and the Pacific War, foreign commercial companies gradually withdrew, and Japanese commercial companies concentrated and merged. Many also closed down and went out of business. In the end, the only commercial companies remaining in Dalian were D汽, 東亞, 油船, 山下, and 三井, in addition to the Manchuria Shipping Company.</p>
<p>When Soviet troops reached the outer perimeter and core of Lushun and Dalian, there were fewer Japanese ships in Dalian Bay, except for a few Soviet ships and some wooden boats used by the Communist army. Very few other ships came and went.</p>
<p>Commercial and Industrial Prospects</p>
<p>In the past, commerce in Lushun and Dalian and its surroundings was subject to extreme control. The people's daily necessities were entirely handled by Japanese-Manchu commercial companies, fiber companies, fruit companies, and fisheries companies. In addition, under the Trade Federation of the Puppet Manchukuo and Kwantung Leased Territory, thirty-nine industrial cooperatives were established to handle allocation.</p>
<p>In order to assist the government in implementing its economic policies, the Japanese, in addition to the commercial and industrial sectors, also included agriculture and fisheries. In Dalian, Lushun, Jinzhou, and other places, they established the "Kwantung Leased Territory Economic Association," a joint organization of various groups, with more than 2,400 members.</p>
<p>Currently, all commercial organizations have changed in nature. Some are managed entirely by the Soviet Union, and some are engaged in distorted commercial operations in the hands of the Communist army.</p>
<p>Industry occupies an important position in the economic sphere. The development of industry in this region was due to the establishment of the Shahekou Factory by the South Manchuria Railway Company, or the formation of several component parts factories that were established along with it. The important factories include Dalian Shipyard, Dalian Machinery, Manhua, Mancao, Manshi, and the last to be established, Manzhou Heavy Machinery, Sanmeng, Marconi, etc. By 1941, Dalian had 1,043 factories with five or more employees, Lushun had 122 factories, Jinzhou had 147 factories, Pulandian had 38 factories, and Piziwo had 22 factories, totaling 1,372 factories, with an investment of over 558.8 million Manchukuo yuan and a production value of over 490 million yuan.</p>
<p>In May 1942, the "Kwantung Leased Territory Industrial Association" was established. The main tasks of the association were to conduct surveys and research on the same industry, allocate materials to member factories, and train technical personnel for self-sufficient farms. Members included those with an investment of over 500,000 yuan or "associations" recognized by the labor union, including textile industry, metal machinery industry, chemical industry, oil and fat industry, kiln industry, food industry, electricity and gas, etc.</p>
<p>Profits from Fishing and Salt</p>
<p>The fishing industry is also an important industry. At the same time, the "Kwantung Leased Territory" is also the only aquatic product of the Northeast because the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea on both sides of the Far Eastern Peninsula produce abundant species such as mackerel, crucian carp, horse mackerel, 鯔, yellow croaker, sea bream, hairtail, bass, and shrimp.</p>
<p>In 1926, the "Kwantung Leased Territory Fisheries Association" was established for the purpose of improving and developing the fishing industry. An office was set up within the Kwantung Leased Territory Government, and branches were established in Dalian, Lushun, Jinzhou, Pulandian, and Piziwo. Members included 380 Japanese and 5,250 Chinese. The main businesses of the association were to open fish markets in Dalian and Lushun, and to engage in market research on aquatic products, or fisheries protection and management. In 1939, it was reorganized into Kwantung Leased Territory Fisheries Promotion Company.</p>
<p>A fisheries experiment station was established in Tiger Beach. The business it handles includes experiments or surveys related to aquatic products, as well as analysis or identification of aquatic products. In addition, there is a fisheries training institute, which focuses on training fisheries cadres.</p>
<p>This area has low rainfall, strong evaporation, and a dry atmosphere, making it most suitable for salt production. In the past, it was a famous salt-producing area along with Taiwan and Qingdao. When the Japanese began to rule, only a few Chinese had salt fields, and the rest were operated by the Japanese. Salt fields were located in Piziwo, Dengshahe, Pulandian, Jinzhou, Jiaxinzi, Shihe, Lushun and other places. Most of the salt produced was transported to the Japanese mainland and Korea. The uses of salt produced in various places in Piziwo include salt for the chemical industry, washing salt, and edible salt. Recently, it can be used to produce aluminum for aviation from 滷水, so the 滷水 industry has great prospects for development. The Japanese then established the "Kwantung Leased Territory 滷水 Chemical Factory" in Pulandian, and the "Kwantung Leased Territory Potassium Industrial Factory" in Jiaxinzi, both of which produce a lot of solid 滷水, most of which is supplied to the chemical industry in Korea.</p>
<p>In 1933, the Kwantung Leased Territory Salt Industry Experiment Station was established in Dafangshen, and a branch was established in Lushun. Later, due to the development of the brine industry, an experimental factory was also established to conduct salt-making experiments and surveys, salt-making research and analysis, and brine utilization experiments and research.</p>
<p>Farmland and Minerals</p>
<p>The food produced in the core and surrounding areas of Lushun and Dalian is not enough to meet the local needs, and a large amount must be supplied from southern and northern Liaoning every year. The main grains produced are corn, followed by peanuts, sorghum, and chestnuts. The most common vegetables are Chinese cabbage, radishes, and melons.</p>
<p>The climate and soil in this area are most suitable for growing fruit trees. Early-producing pears, apricots, hawthorns, etc., were grown after 1906. Apples, grapes, or cherries have become excellent, especially apples, which are now widely cultivated.</p>
<p>An agricultural experiment station is located outside the East Gate of Jinzhou, divided into departments for agronomy, fruit trees, vegetables, agronomy, chemistry, insects, and sericulture. In order to improve the quality of important export agricultural products, a special export agricultural product inspection office was established, which has achieved great success in terms of export reputation.</p>
<p>Although there are no large-scale mineral deposits in the outer perimeter of Lushun and Dalian, the mining industry is very developed. Currently, about ten kinds of minerals are mined, including dolomite, asbestos, gold, iron, coal, barite, fluorite, manganese, emery, and vanadium ore.</p>
<p>Dolomite is abundant and of good quality. Most of the minerals are transported to the Japanese mainland, and the rest are consumed in the Anshan Iron and Steel Works and the Shanyuan Micro-Powder Fish Feed Factory in Dalian. Dolomite is mostly used as refractory material for high-temperature furnaces in ironmaking, 結合劑 in glass, and high-grade coatings for general civil engineering construction.</p>
<p>Asbestos is produced in Shangshan, Jinzhou, and barite and fluorite are produced in Pulandian. Other minerals are distributed in various places.</p>
<p>In the past, the "Kwantung Leased Territory" was a specialized area, with beauty and ugliness. On the one hand, it was civilization and enlightenment, and on the other hand, it was oppression and barbarism. The Japanese had a good time, and the compatriots suffered cruel treatment. Just take the Japanese police as an example, the compatriots seemed like mice seeing cats. Today, the term "Kwantung Leased Territory" no longer exists, the demonic shadow has disappeared, the entire area has been restored to the territory of China, and it only depends on how we use it and how we develop it!</p>
<h3>Taiwan Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>— Taipei Airmail News on the 19th, Correspondent of This Newspaper in Taiwan, Yang Yu</p>
<p>The rubber industry, which is deeply and significantly related to national defense and people's livelihood, has not had a planned large factory in Taiwan because rubber trees are not suitable for planting. There are only some sporadic small-scale manufacturing plants. Until after the Second World War, Japan was threatened by the interruption of sea transportation and felt the danger that the rubber industry could not catch up quickly. Therefore, it merged many small manufacturing plants in Taiwan Province into a unified "Taiwan 橡膠株式會社" in 1941. It started large-scale construction between Songshan and Nangang in the suburbs of Taipei City, improved equipment, expanded its scale, and implemented a monopoly policy to supply military shoes, bicycle tires, aircraft tires, etc., during the war. At the same time, this company also had a high degree of performance in manufacturing all accessories equipped on various agricultural, industrial, and mining machines. At the end of the war, it also built a factory to manufacture automobile and truck tires. All the machines had been assembled, but the atomic bomb finally forced the invaders to abandon many large factories like this that they were reluctant to let go of.</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties and Producing More Than Three Million</p>
<p>On April 17, 1946, the Taiwan Provincial Department of Industry and Mining officially took over this company and renamed it "Taiwan Rubber Factory," which was affiliated with the Chemical Products Company. According to Director Shen Yunjie, the working capital taken over from the Japanese at that time was more than 700,000 Taiwan dollars. The depreciated value of finished products and semi-finished products in stock was also nearly 9.5 million Taiwan dollars. The estimated value of other houses, land, and machines was about 20 million Taiwan dollars. However, the most difficult thing was the raw materials in the factory because the ocean was blocked at the beginning, and the number of old inventories was very small. At the same time, many machines were scattered everywhere to avoid Allied bombing, and the factory was dilapidated with incomplete doors and windows. But it has become our own thing, and it cannot be stopped for a moment on the road of reconstruction after the recovery! After the supervision of the superiors and the concerted efforts of the subordinates, we finally overcame this difficulty and worked hard for several months. In the months of September, October, and November, the production figures were slightly reduced due to the reorganization relationship. But by December, the production figures for the first half of the month alone exceeded 3 million Taiwan dollars, and it is estimated that the whole month will be more than 7 million Taiwan dollars.</p>
<p>Shoe Manufacturing Speed Is Amazing</p>
<p>The reporter was led by Mr. Xie Qiyuan of the factory's technical department to visit several parts of the factory: The roller factory is for pressing preliminary ingredients and recycled rubber products. The whole piece of rubber, together with many necessary sulfur, softening agents, fillers, anti-aging agents, etc., are poured in between two smooth large rollers, kneading like making noodles, gradually becoming soft, and mixing with the medicine to form a black sheet of skin. It takes about half an hour to complete the preliminary raw rubber, and then it is taken out and pressed into thick and thin rubber sheets and many applied patterns with a flattening machine when it is to be used. Manufacturing recycled rubber is the work of waste utilization. The broken rubber that has been "vulcanized" is ground into powder in a machine, and then a softening agent is added and heated to high temperature to take out the rubber mixed in the raw rubber. The machine equipment in this part includes seven roller machines, one crushing roller, one grinder, five glazing machines, one drum dryer, two vulcanizers, six rubber paste mixers, seven cutting machines, and six press speed machines. Now most of them are in full operation.</p>
<p>The first factory is a factory that manufactures various types of shoes such as men's and women's long and short rain boots, sneakers, and underground socks (Japanese-style shoes with two toes separated). 251 sewing machines continuously tread the cloth taken from the cutting machine into the shape of shoes, and the female workers apply glue and attach the soles. Because rain boots are all made of rubber, the procedure is more complicated, but on average, a pair can be glued together in 15 minutes. There are 978 pairs of raw aluminum shoe molds for underground socks, 3,835 pairs of sneakers, 1,892 pairs of full rubber short shoes, 389 pairs of long boots, 3,538 pairs of front round soles, and 2,000 pairs of rain boots, but the appearance is very old. Now, in addition to having newly made many models of women's long boots, it will continue to improve and add to them next year.</p>
<p>Most of the finished products have to go through the vulcanization (that is, heating) procedure. They are loaded into a vulcanizer with wooden frames and sprayed with high-temperature steam to make the rubber and sulfur undergo a chemical reaction and become durable. This direct vulcanization easily causes colored cloth to fade, and an indirect vulcanizer will be applied soon.</p>
<p>Rubber Hoses Can Be Supplied in Large Quantities</p>
<p>The second factory specializes in manufacturing rickshaw bicycle tires and water pipes. The machine equipment here is completely suitable for tubular production. During the war, the Japanese forced the people to buy fire hoses to avoid losses from bombing. Now, on average, each household has more than 40 feet of rubber pipes, so although it has the capacity of producing 2,000 feet per day, sales are sluggish. They all hope to accept orders from other provinces and use the business funds to expand the scope locally.</p>
<p>The third factory that manufactures automobile and truck tires is fully equipped, but it has not been able to start work because it lacks the thick Cord inside the outer tire.</p>
<p>Next year, the Rubber Factory has formulated a plan to produce 7,000 pairs of shoes, 33,765 feet of pipes, 1,588 feet of rollers, 520 tires, 13,000 feet of buffers, 600 automobile tires, and 5,600 bicycle tires per month, with a total value of more than 10 million Taiwan dollars. The production figures during the Japanese operation have not yet been found out, but according to Director Shen, because raw materials can be purchased from Southeast Asia, and sales will be promoted in the future, the estimated production volume for next year can at least exceed the past.</p>

<h3>On Local National Structure</h3>
<p>— Ruan Yicheng</p>
<p>In this National Assembly, Chapter 11 of the draft constitution proposed by the National Government, originally titled "Provincial and County System," was renamed "Local System" by the Sixth Review Committee. This chapter can be said to be the most progressive chapter of this constitution compared to the "May Fifth Constitution," because it connects with the preceding Chapter 10, establishing the application of balanced local power. We know that this constitution has two basic principles regarding the organization of the state: decentralized central power and balanced local power, both of which are the legacy of the Founding Father. However, in the past, some people often viewed the decentralization of central power as a single power exercised by the president alone, and regarded the balanced local power as centralized power, with everything controlled by the central government. The establishment of the status of the local system in the constitution is of great importance to the future of national construction.</p>
<p>Since the period of political tutelage, the work of local autonomy has never been completed. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the National Government promulgated the "Outline of Organizations at All Levels of Counties" in the 29th year of the Republic (1940), known as the New County System, which integrated the baojia system with autonomy and emphasized both undertakings and organization. This could have been a good opportunity to promote local autonomy. However: (1) the New County System never went through legislative procedures, and the County Autonomy Law was never formulated by the Legislative Yuan; (2) the central government assigned national administrative matters such as conscription and grain collection to local autonomous bodies, and required local areas to bear the expenses; (3) various local autonomous undertakings were under the management of several unrelated agencies in the central government and provinces, resulting in inconsistent laws and regulations, disjointed plans, subjective biases, and different evaluation standards; (4) the curriculum for cadre training was verbose and impractical, and it failed to align with the regular education system. Therefore, although the New County System stipulated that it should be completed within three years, only a part of the organization was completed, and the undertakings were far from complete. Especially after the War of Resistance against Japan, power had to be concentrated in the central government, and the status of provinces and counties declined, leading to the bankruptcy of provincial and county finances, the inability to improve the treatment of public and educational personnel, and the lack of funding for undertakings. Even minor matters had to be subject to central government orders or require instructions from the central government, which led to the central government focusing on achieving uniformity in form, while the local areas became inactive and unable to take action. Therefore, today, it is difficult for those responsible at the local level and the people to answer the question of why local autonomy has not been completed.</p>
<p>The purpose of the local system is to establish a systematic local autonomy system. In the new constitution, we can see that:</p>
<p>(A) The legal system of local autonomy is top-down. The autonomous status recognized by the constitution is explicitly stipulated in the constitution that the general principles of provincial and county autonomy are legislated and implemented by the central government, or delegated to the provinces and counties for implementation. The general principles of provincial and county autonomy are subsidiary laws to the constitution, but they are parent laws to the provincial and county autonomy laws. Since the general principles are legislated by the central government, the autonomy laws of each province and county cannot violate them in the future. In other words, the content can still be largely the same. Those who are worried about local areas formulating their own autonomy laws can rest assured that the autonomy systems of the provinces and counties will not differ too much. The constitution stipulates that the provincial people's representative assemblies formulate provincial autonomy laws based on the general principles of provincial and county autonomy. Therefore, from the perspective of the legal system of autonomy, it is still top-down and will not become a federal state.</p>
<p>(B) The content of the provincial and county autonomy laws still retains a lot of flexibility. The constitution only stipulates that there should be general principles of provincial and county autonomy, without detailing its content. The content of the provincial autonomy law only specifies three main items in the constitution, and the county autonomy law does not specify the content either. All of these leave flexibility for local legislation. Therefore, we hope that the central government will not be too verbose when formulating the general principles of provincial and county autonomy in the future, so that the provincial and county autonomy laws cannot adapt to local conditions. The relationship between provinces and counties, the organization of provincial and county governments, and the autonomous organizations and undertakings below the county level are not listed in the constitution, with the aim of reserving more flexibility for the provincial and county autonomy laws. It will not be like the present situation, where even the most detailed matters require the central government to exert effort.</p>
<p>(C) Provinces and counties all have representative assemblies and legislative power. The constitution stipulates that provincial and county people's representative assemblies formulate provincial and county autonomy laws. This is because before the new provincial and county assemblies are established, there should first be law-making bodies to formulate provincial and county autonomy laws. The provincial and county people's representative assemblies are not like the National Assembly and may not be permanent bodies. Whether the election and recall of provincial and county heads, the amendment of provincial and county autonomy laws, still need to be handled by convening provincial and county people's representative assemblies, or by the provincial and county assemblies, or by directly exercising the four powers by provincial and county citizens, can be stipulated by each province and county in its own provincial and county autonomy laws, without forcing uniformity among the provinces and counties. For example, today, county head elections have already been implemented in Xinjiang, but some counties have not yet been able to do so. This shows that uniformity is not necessary in order to adapt to local conditions. The constitution also stipulates that provincial and county assemblies exercise provincial and county legislative power, which is also very important. Because the balanced power advocated by the Founding Father is balanced administrative power and balanced affairs. The judicial, supervisory, and examination powers among the administrative powers should be unified under the central government and have a national unified nature. The administrative and legislative powers should be shared by the central government and the provinces and counties. Otherwise, the spirit of the balanced power system cannot be implemented. Therefore, the provincial and county people's representative assemblies exercise the political power to create provincial and county autonomy laws, while the provincial and county assemblies exercise the local legislative power belonging to administrative power. Both are necessary.</p>
<p>(D) In addition to stipulating matters that are legislated and implemented by the central government, and matters that are legislated by the central government and implemented by the provinces and counties, the constitution also stipulates matters that are legislated and implemented by the provinces and matters that are legislated and implemented by the counties. This is a three-level balanced power system. Listing the powers of the central government, provinces, and counties truly conforms to the principle of balanced power. The remaining powers of unlisted items will be attributed to the central government, provinces, or counties based on their nature in the future. In case of disputes, they will be resolved by the central Legislative Yuan elected by the people through universal suffrage. This fully expresses the Founding Father's balanced power system. Because the content of local autonomy does not lie in empty legal provisions that define it as an autonomous unit, but in determining the items of its autonomous affairs. Once the items are determined, the situation of mutual power struggles or mutual evasion of responsibility between the central government, provinces, and counties can be avoided. The expenses for an affair handled by the central government, a province, or a county will be borne by the central government, the province, or the county, which can also eliminate the disadvantages of the central government, provinces, and counties competing for profits or unequal rights and obligations. For many years, some people have advocated reducing the powers of the provinces, thinking that reducing the powers of the provinces would increase the powers of the counties. In fact, this is not the case. Given the large number of counties in our country, the vast differences in population, area, culture, and resources among the counties, and the fact that most counties are currently unable to be self-sufficient, if the powers of the provinces are reduced, the counties will not be able to bear their affairs. As a result, the central government will have to act on their behalf, which will invisibly increase the responsibilities and powers of the central government. This is detrimental to the provinces and does not benefit the counties. This is not what those who promote local autonomy want to see, but it is also something that they have not anticipated.</p>
<p>The foundation of constitutionalism lies in autonomy, and the root of democracy lies in the local areas. Now that the constitution has a local system that conforms to the legacy and the national conditions, it is hoped that all local areas in the country can make good use of this sound local system and lay the most solid cornerstone for the future of national construction.</p>
<h3>Freedom of Assembly and Association</h3>
<p>— Huisheng</p>
<p>Article 14 of Chapter II of the Constitution of the Republic of China states: "The people have the freedom of assembly and association." This provision seems very ordinary and does not seem to have any problems. In fact, there are many problems now.</p>
<p>The problem does not arise because freedom is limited to the point where it cannot be enjoyed. On the contrary, it arises because some people enjoy freedom, which leads to the loss of freedom for others.</p>
<p>It is well known that lawyers and accountants cannot practice their professions without becoming members of their local associations. The current Trade Association Law and Labor Union Law also enforce compulsory membership. For example, Article 12 of Chapter III of the Labor Union Law stipulates: "All male and female workers who are 16 years of age or older in the area where the labor union is organized shall join the labor union of the same industry or profession they are engaged in." Article 12 of Chapter III of the Commercial Trade Association Law also stipulates that commercial companies and firms in the same region, whether publicly or privately operated, shall be members of the commercial trade association, except for publicly operated enterprises with seals or state-run businesses stipulated by law. Article 42 of Chapter VIII of the same law also stipulates: "Companies and firms that do not join the commercial trade association in accordance with this law... may be subject to the following penalties, depending on the circumstances: 1. Breach of contract fine; 2. Suspension of business for a period of time; 3. Permanent suspension of business." The Industrial Trade Association Law also has similar provisions. That is to say, these companies, firms, and factories must join the association to become members. In other words, these companies, firms, and factories have an obligation to join the association and do not have the freedom to choose whether or not to join. If it is confirmed that they have freedom, then joining is certainly acceptable, but not joining seems to be acceptable as well.</p>
<p>Because the current law stipulates that everyone must join in the positive aspect and stipulates various sanctions in the consumption aspect, people feel that assembly and association is an obligation, not a right. The word "freedom" seems somewhat out of place. Moreover, many disputes have already occurred in fact. Because some industrial and commercial elements are willing to give up their rights and unwilling to enjoy this compulsory freedom, those who handle association affairs have to take various actions to force them to join. They either persuade and urge them to join, or send many people to threaten them, or even ask the government to force them to join by order. These free-spirited individuals who are unwilling to join use various methods to evade and deal with the situation, trying to escape. As a result, many disputes over assembly and association have been created. As far as I can see, some associations even require foreign businesses to join across the board. However, according to Article 2 of the "Measures for Foreign Nationals to Organize Chambers of Commerce and Participate in Commercial Organizations," if there are fewer than five foreign businesses of the same nationality in the same county or city government's town, they may join the local trade association of their respective industry as members. It seems that there is still some freedom to choose whether or not to join, because the meaning of the word "may" is different from "must" and "shall." How these disputes should be resolved is beyond the scope of this article. What I want to study here is whether people have the freedom of assembly and association, and whether they also have the freedom not to assemble or associate. To extend this further, if the current law stipulates that there is no such freedom, then do these current laws conflict with the spirit of the constitution?</p>
<p>Some people think that Article 23 of the constitution states: "The freedoms and rights listed in the above articles may not be restricted by law, except to prevent obstruction of the freedom of others..." According to this provision, restricting freedom by law is not considered unconstitutional. They do not know that the meaning of this article is that in certain situations, the freedom of assembly and association of the people can be restricted by law. That is to say, when they should be able to assemble and associate, they are not allowed to assemble and associate. It is not that when they do not want to assemble and associate, they are forced to assemble and associate. If the freedom stipulated by the constitution must be forcibly enjoyed by the people, then this freedom is already an obligation, not freedom, and not a right. This article should be changed to "The people have the obligation to assemble and associate in accordance with the law," and be treated the same as paying taxes and serving in the military, or be changed to "The people have the right and obligation to assemble and associate," like compulsory education, in order to be coherent. Moreover, the freedoms of the people stipulated by the constitution, in addition to assembly and association, also include residence, migration, speech, lecturing, writing, publishing, secret communication, and freedom of religion. If assembly and association can be forced by law, they must believe in and speak about... According to the true meaning of freedom, I am afraid it is a bit inappropriate! According to Nanjing telegraphic news, the government has begun to review the current laws and plans to amend or revise those that conflict with the new constitution. Whether the above-mentioned laws restricting freedom should be amended seems worthy of review.</p>
<p>Some people believe that if a free membership system is adopted during the implementation of economic controls, it may increase the difficulty in promoting policies. This statement also has considerable reasons. However, what this article emphasizes is the freedom of the people, not the so-called control, and the spirit of the constitution, not the trivial means of control. This should be stated incidentally.</p>

<h3>A Scam in the Henan Education Sector</h3>
<p>— Kaifeng, December 23rd, Air Mail. Wang Shoumei, reporter stationed in Bian for this newspaper</p>
<p>There are many strange things in the Henan education sector. This semester started late, and elementary school students spent a lot of time taking classes in the courtyard. The young students who fled here do not want to move out of the schools, but no one cares about them—some agencies still claim to be working on youth movements and occupy the most enemy and puppet properties, but they do not allow them to be used for good deeds, but instead sing operas for a few days each week and open canteens! Wounded soldiers live in the schools, as if it should be so. Middle school students have been taking classes for a long time, but they have not done a single composition! Publicly funded students are not getting enough to eat, but no one cares. The students of Henan University are dissatisfied with their incompetent professors and feel a deep sense of emptiness and sadness, constantly calling on all parties to save them in the newspapers. The students in the schools are like this, but there are even more students outside the schools—it is difficult to get into school, let alone those who do not have the ability to study. In Kaifeng alone, there are about 220,000 elementary school-age children out of school. No one pays attention to these phenomena, and Henan education is originally backward. It is in these circumstances that a major scam occurred in Henan—this is also a major strange thing and miracle in the Henan education sector.</p>
<p>Donating a School to Swindle Money</p>
<p>In a situation where many young people are out of school, Henan produced a correspondence college, whose president, Jing Zhongtian, is "a native of Deng County, Henan, who is 30 years old, unmarried, frank, honest, enthusiastic, hardworking, and responsible." His friend and also his major assistant, Hao Guanru, introduced him to society in this way after the scam was exposed and called him the "Wu Xun" of Henan. However, some people said that he was a "kid" and a "big swindler." Speaking matter-of-factly, he is not Mr. Wu Xun of Shandong, but Liang Zuoyou of Shandong. He has a good business sense. Seeing that there were many young people who had dropped out of university, he took the opportunity of "donating a school" to transform the correspondence college into "Zhongzheng College." The word "college" is already attractive enough, and adding the words "Zhongzheng" naturally makes it even more extraordinary. Not to mention this, he even sent telegrams to various counties in a "joint" tone, asking them to "recommend" students. Good, many young people came upon hearing the news. As Hao Guanru said, "The number of students suddenly increased, exceeding 200, exceeding 300, and exceeding 500 in less than two weeks. Classrooms, dormitories, and utensils became a serious problem all at once." I once braved the cold wind to visit. The so-called "Zhongzheng College" is just a few dilapidated houses and a small, low-lying Yanguang Temple on Caomen Street. The houses are dilapidated, the students live on the damp ground, and a small office only has a table for collecting fees. I also saw a mimeograph machine and two staff members who were students on loan. The regulations stipulate that each student pays 100,000 yuan. The poor young people collected more than 50 million yuan and sent it to Liang Zuoyou of Henan.</p>
<p>Incompetent Professors</p>
<p>The "college" also has various departments. Who are the people in them? They are almost all incompetent professors from Henan University, who are the "comrades" of Liang Zuoyou of Henan. The dean of academic affairs is Yang Zhenhua, the dean of student affairs is Chen Zibei, the director of education is Zhao Wanli, and the professor is Ren Fangqiu. These people colluded and set up a heinous scam to deceive the lovable young people. Let's take a look at the secret No. 3 gray telegram sent by this group of educational swindlers to various counties. It has a seal as large as the seal of the Pacification Commissioner:</p>
<p>"In order to celebrate Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday and respond to the school donation movement in various places, this college has renamed the university lecture class organized by the Henan Correspondence College as Zhongzheng College and has officially established it by telegraphing Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Education on October 31. According to the investigation of the source of students of this college, the counties were previously requested by the correspondence college to send recommendations by letter for further study, originally to train middle school teachers. Now that it has been renamed Zhongzheng College, the nature is no different from that of a general university. It is divided into five departments: mathematics, physics, literature, history, education, art, law, and political science, specializing in cultivating talents. Since the time for this semester is short, the counties are requested to strictly examine the recommended students in accordance with the regulations and report to the college with a letter before the end of November for admission without examination..."</p>
<p>Not to mention this, let's look at what it says in the minutes of their meeting. The following resolutions were made at the first school affairs meeting on December 8:</p>
<p>(1) What to do with students recommended by various counties who report to the college after the deadline? Resolution: They shall all be allowed to report to the college.</p>
<p>(2) What to do if the dormitory cannot accommodate them? Resolution: Inform the students to raise their own funds when they report to the college.</p>
<p>(3) How to preserve the student status of students who need to ask for leave to return home due to special circumstances? Resolution: The student status shall be preserved.</p>
<p>(4) How to make up the lessons of students who are late? Resolution: A. Those who fail the midterm exam shall be allowed to make up the lessons in the next semester; B. Those who do not participate in the exam shall retake the course.</p>
<p>(5) How to deal with tuition fees if students who have reported to the college and paid tuition fees are approved by the school to return home due to special circumstances? Resolution: For students who report to the college and pay tuition fees after donating a school, both tuition fees and student status shall be preserved.</p>
<p>(6) How to handle student grades? Resolution: Leave it to the professors to handle in full.</p>
<p>(7) How to build the school buildings? Resolution: First build the lecture hall with seats, four rooms per hall, start planning immediately, and complete it before the start of the next semester.</p>
<p>(8) How to regulate the school system of this college? Resolution: Adopt the credit system.</p>
<p>(9) Whether to add departments in the next semester? Resolution: Add the Department of Journalism.</p>
<p>Scam Exposed</p>
<p>Needless to say, let's understand the true nature of this college from the confession of this group of swindlers. Students pay tuition fees, but there is no place to live, no classroom to attend classes, they can go home, and they can preserve their student status. What a brilliant method of "preferential treatment"! More than 50 million yuan, excluding more than 20 million yuan that was squandered by them, more than 30 million yuan is deposited in commercial firms. Taking a 10% interest rate as an example, the pure interest is 5 million yuan per month! In this day and age, there are ways to make money, it depends on whether you can "be unconventional." Today, there are also dregs of "swindling money" in the education sector.</p>
<p>How was this scam exposed? It turned out that some lovable young people, after being swindled to Kaifeng and realizing the truth, inquired about the situation with their fellow villagers in the Senate. At the fourth standing committee meeting of the Provincial Senate on the 9th, they sent a letter to the Education Department requesting them to attend and report on the handling of this school. The Chief Secretary of the Education Department, Le Tian, said: "The predecessor of the college was originally a correspondence college, first in Nanyang, which was supplementary education in nature. During the school donation movement, it directly telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Education. It only notified the provincial government to investigate. Although it did not receive a reply, it officially established itself without authorization and notified various counties to recommend students. Regardless of whether it meets the regulations and procedures for donating a school, according to laws and regulations, the recommendation of students is limited to normal school students. Even Zhongda University cannot recommend students. This move by the college is extremely illegal! After learning about it last week, we have submitted a signed report to the provincial government for instructions." The provincial government and the Education Department are only focusing on the legal aspects and not on deceiving young people and defrauding them of money. The handling methods formulated by the Provincial Senate are:</p>
<p>(1) The Education Department should immediately order the college to be sealed up.</p>
<p>(2) The people in charge of the college should be sent to the court for interrogation to prevent them from absconding.</p>
<p>(3) All tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by the college should be refunded in full and compensate the students for their losses.</p>
<p>(4) The Education Department should immediately telegraph the various counties to stop recommending students and prevent them from being deceived.</p>
<p>(5) The circumstances of the punishment of the college should be published in newspapers.</p>
<p>On the night of the 9th, this swindler was arrested!</p>
<p>The students' hard-earned money of tens of millions has been sealed up.</p>
<p>Three Opinions</p>
<p>This scam caused a sensation throughout Henan. The friends of "Liang Zuoyou of Henan" even moved around and shamelessly said that this scam guest was the "Wu Xun of Henan!" The truth is here. This great president has been transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>
<p>More than 500 lovable young people have become the most pitiful figures in this scam, and society is most concerned about them. On the 13th, they entertained the press and said painfully: They came here after suffering hardships in order to seek knowledge, and now they have been severely deceived. They are panicked and anxious and hope that those who care about them will give them more assistance! They put forward three opinions:</p>
<p>(1) They hope that the government will change the illegal "Zhongzheng College" into a private university.</p>
<p>(2) Send them to the soon-to-be-established commercial colleges and other specialized schools.</p>
<p>(3) They hope to deal with this issue quickly to avoid delaying their studies and time.</p>
<p>Resettlement Problem</p>
<p>How to deal with it is not yet known. The media and the Senate are appealing to the authorities to pay attention to the resettlement problem of these more than 500 deceived young people!</p>
<p>In Henan, strange things often happen in the education sector, which is also inevitable. The whole of Henan is being persecuted by internal strife, the people are living in suffering, and living under the ravages of war. All aspects are not worth seeing, and all aspects are progressing in an abnormal way—how can the education sector be an exception?</p>
<p>This scam shows the serious problems in Henan education. Not only are there many young people out of school, but also the universities, middle schools, and elementary schools should be reorganized. In the period of celebrating Chairman Chiang's birthday and actively launching the school donation movement, the emergence of this major scam is a great regret and indignation!</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Suao Fishing Port (Sent by Jiang Muyun, Special Correspondent of this Newspaper)</p>
<p>There are a total of more than 570 male and female workers here. People from this province account for 98%. Some have been working here since the factory opened and have never left. They are experienced and skilled. They are a group of hardworking and meritorious unsung heroes in the industrial sector of Taiwan Province. There are 68 employees, about 34% of whom are from other provinces and about 56% of whom are from this province, but there is no gap here and they are very harmonious. Only after sound personnel management can we talk about increasing production. What's more, this is the only rubber factory in this province, and I have unlimited hope for it!</p>

<h3>Service Ethics</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Zheng Jiapu, recorded by You Maoquan</p>
<p>The Chinese nation has always emphasized morality, but now moral concepts have weakened with this war. Therefore, unimaginable things often happen in society now. However, if a country wants to be strong and a nation wants to revive, it must emphasize morality under any circumstances! Even within a group, factory, business, or even family, morality should be the prerequisite. Now I will talk about the two words "sincerity" and "public spirit":</p>
<p>"Sincerity": When doing things for others, you must treat their affairs as your own, and be even more considerate than they are. You should also be sincere in dealing with people, and never be hypocritical or artificial. Zhu Xi said, "Those who cannot move others have not yet achieved sincerity." From this, we can see the importance of the meaning of "sincerity."</p>
<p>"Public Spirit": No matter what you do, only by abandoning self-interest and forgetting personal prejudices can you reach the stage of "public spirit." At the same time, you can further dedicate yourself to the cause from "utmost impartiality," and only in this way can you achieve results in your career.</p>
<p>Technology in books is just general theory. If you go from school to the factory without experiencing hard work and practical experience, the results you get will be very limited. Most people are inherently averse to hard work and like to enjoy themselves, but by overcoming hardships and difficulties and forming a habit, although it may be difficult at first, the result will be that the suffering will eventually be followed by happiness, and you can also find joy in labor. Especially now, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek shows us "After the completion of the War of Resistance, construction begins," the textile industry occupies a very important position in the light industry sector, and it is also the primary issue for the people's livelihood of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. At present, factories in our country that have been destroyed are difficult to restore due to various limitations. If we seek to expand further, it is definitely not possible in the short term. However, according to the calculation of our country's 450 million population, clothing and bedding are not self-sufficient, so in the future, we will definitely need to expand according to specific plans.</p>
<h3>A Year's Plan</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>After passing the end of the thirty-fifth year, the general industry and commerce seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, although the upcoming end of the lunar year is still a major event pressing on the heart. Many manufacturers do not know how to deal with this imminent crisis.</p>
<p>However, the crisis will eventually pass. How to pass it, of course, is another question. In my opinion, overcoming the crisis is important, but the plan for the thirty-sixth year seems to be even more important.</p>
<p>All manufacturers who are thinking about and considering how to overcome the end of the year, and the responsible personnel of the authorities, may have a feeling, wondering why this year's crisis is so difficult to break? Although they know that the biggest reason is due to high-interest loans. However, how did they incur such a huge amount? Therefore, after overcoming the crisis, we must do a good job, and by doing a good job, we mean doing it cautiously, or doing it with a plan.</p>
<p>Originally, any manufacturer cannot escape the three most important departments, namely "production," "sales," and "economic management." Speaking of production, wages are so high, and the cost of living increases monthly, with numerous difficulties. Speaking of sales, transportation has not been fully restored, and the region has not been developed, so even if it is sold, it is very limited. Speaking of economic management, it is even more laborious. Many manufacturers spend most of their time every day, and important time, on the management of silver, moving east to make up for the west, and being stretched thin.</p>
<p>However, in fact, there is no such ideal way to do a good job. Production, sales, and economic management are inseparable and must be complementary. If there is a situation of taking care of one thing and losing sight of the other, it will cause the entire organization to lose balance, and over time, it will become unmanageable.</p>
<p>"Prevention is better than cure" is originally a most valuable saying, and it is even more valuable to apply it in the industrial sector. Currently, what most people are busy with is treatment work rather than prevention work. Therefore, treatment cannot be perfect, even treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. How can we talk about prevention?</p>
<p>But on careful thought, prevention work can be done and is a basic work. At the beginning of this year, we should formulate a production plan for the whole year, design complete and comprehensive statistical charts and budget tables. This arduous and important work may involve gathering every important department of the entire organization and spending several days and nights to complete it. Then, follow this plan to divide the work and cooperate, so that when the time comes, the responsible personnel can look at the forms and make decisions about everything without being flustered and disorganized.</p>
<p>When preparing this plan, for production, we should investigate the increase or decrease in sales figures of various products over the years to determine which ones should continue to be maintained and which ones should be discontinued. Because producing too many types of products is an important reason for poor turnover.</p>
<p>For sales, we should investigate the past sales, existing sales, and potential sales in each place and region. Then, use effective advertising to coordinate. There must be a complete plan. At this critical moment, if we only know what is happening but not why it is happening, then many difficulties will arise.</p>
<p>As for economic management, it can be said that it balances production and sales and is also the driving force for production and sales. Currently, most manufacturers rely on high-interest loans to quench their thirst because of the lack of working capital.</p>
<p>In theory, the so-called working capital is "liquid assets that can be used for business operations." This definition is more appropriate and more suitable for the current environment than "working capital is the difference between liquid assets and liquid liabilities." Because working capital absolutely needs to be flexible.</p>
<p>To do economic management work, statistics, budgets, and charts are the best tools. Without these tools, it is like a ship without a compass. Today, we have to deal with a huge expenditure, and tomorrow, we have to deal with an overdue loan. The progress of affairs will never have a normal day.</p>
<p>The environment no longer allows us to lose normality. Therefore, if there is no detailed plan, we will not only fail to create the environment, but we will inevitably be dominated by the environment, and even be sacrificed by the environment.</p>
<p>The past is already past, and everything in the future is waiting for us to "take good care of ourselves." I think enlightened people in the industrial and commercial circles must have the same feeling.</p>
<h3>American Working Women and the Department of Labor</h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>Today, the number of working women in the United States is close to seventeen million. In 1870, there were less than two million working women. During these seventy years, women have continuously struggled to improve working conditions, raise employment standards, and strive for equal treatment and opportunities for men and women.</p>
<p>At first, with the advent of the machine age, more and more women went from home to the factory, and the matter of women's paid work involved many problems. At that time, most women were unorganized, untrained, and influenced by prejudice, and did not make much progress. Therefore, women were forced to accept any job, regardless of conditions, and were subjected to greater exploitation than men. Unable to overcome this situation, they turned to the state and federal governments for help and fought against the factors that harmed their employment.</p>
<p>Before World War II, progress in this direction was slow. But after the outbreak of the war, there was an unprecedented need for female workers to fill the jobs left by soldiers who had gone to war. Women entered various industries and positions, replacing men, and even doing extremely dangerous work. They gained new skills, they understood the meaning of improving the organization of working conditions, and they proved to themselves and the world that in addition to the traditional work of managing the home and raising children, they were able to handle many jobs in various industries.</p>
<p>As of July 8, 1918, the United States Department of Labor had only been in existence for more than five years. At that time, the Department of Labor established a temporary Industrial Women's Service Office, whose task was to protect working women during the war. This temporary agency later became permanent and had broader work goals. Women and various progressive forces that exposed the exploitation of working women's interests prompted the government to establish a permanent agency whose task was to support and assist women in achieving the following goals:</p>
<p>Equal employment and promotion opportunities for men and women; no unfair discrimination based on gender, race, age, or marital status; investigation of working women's salaries to ensure that salaries are sufficient to meet the needs of a rich and healthy life; working hours not exceeding eight hours per day or forty hours per week; working hours not set at night; women should have intermittent rest periods in industries where workers should cooperate with the speed of machines; factories should stipulate ample time and comfortable facilities for female workers to dine at the workplace; the workplace should have clean, well-ventilated, and well-lit conditions; the workshop should be equipped with insurance machines and other equipment to prevent disasters; sufficient and clean work equipment; progressive personnel management methods; and the opportunity for collective bargaining.</p>
<p>In June 1920, Congress transformed the temporary Industrial Women's Service Office into a permanent agency and established a Women's Bureau within the Department of Labor. The establishment of this agency was truly a milestone in the history of working women, and in fact, it can also be said to be a milestone in the history of all working people. By 1920, the number of working women had increased to 8.5 million, accounting for one-fifth of the total national labor force. The Women's Bureau immediately established close contact with all employed and job-seeking women, regardless of their race, creed, or marital status. The Women's Bureau immediately became one with women in all occupational fields.</p>
<p>The Women's Bureau initially did a lot of work to remedy various shortcomings. In order to correct erroneous views, the Bureau published accurate news and statistics, which were based on investigations of various factories, offices, warehouses, and interviews with women. In order to determine the Bureau's policies and plans, it also conducted various tests and research on issues such as the health of female workers. The policies and standards determined by the Women's Bureau for female workers were also the result of careful consideration and consultation with other organizations (such as state labor departments, labor organizations, and representatives of employers).</p>
<p>Today, there are 200 kinds of bulletins reporting the situation of working women, as well as pamphlets, newsletters, and films for people to use. The women's community has recently printed many books, such as "Telephone Operators," "Home-Based Working Women," and "Equal Pay Regulations." Those reports on working women's working hours, wages, and working conditions are particularly important. The investigations conducted in response to requests from various parties or jointly with labor agency chiefs often serve as the basis for taking legislative action.</p>
<p>The Bureau cannot formulate any regulations, but it actively studies issues related to existing or proposed regulations and often makes recommendations. Today, considerable progress has been made in legislation regarding the regulation of women's salaries and working hours. In the states, almost three-quarters (including Puerto Rico and Alaska) have minimum wage regulations. States that stipulate that women's working hours shall not exceed eight hours per day or forty-four hours per week account for half of the states.</p>
<p>The Women's Bureau can also be regarded as a source of information. Whenever necessary, it provides public agencies, women's organizations, labor unions, employers, and the public with technical advice, facts, and figures.</p>
<p>In women's activities, the Women's Bureau has occupied an increasingly important position today. In the past thirty years, the Women's Bureau has made considerable progress in women's occupations. Although the Women's Bureau feels that it is still far from its final goal, it has assessed the changing economic situation and formulated future plans to adapt to the development and urgent needs of the post-war era.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Business Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Implementation of Personnel Management 1. Recruitment:</p>
<p>When a business organization needs staff or a manufacturing factory needs labor, it must find ways to hire. When there is a surplus of personnel, it is very convenient to recruit employees. Once it is announced, many people will apply. After screening among those applicants, you can get the employees you need. However, when employees are not easy to recruit, you must consider how to make employees happy to participate. This can be considered from the employee's perspective. Generally, employees are willing to take a job for several reasons, either because of the considerable salary or the provision of food and lodging, or because it is very close to home, or because there are extra allowances, or because the scope of the business organization is very large, and there can be considerable security in the future life, or because the business organization is a promising and prospective career.</p>
<p>Among the above reasons, it is not necessarily possible to have all of them completely. Then, perhaps having one or two can also make employees willing to participate.</p>
<p>The following methods are often used when employees are usually needed:</p>
<p>A. Advertising in newspapers: In the larger newspapers in various places, there are classified advertisements, including a recruitment column. When a business organization needs to hire employees, it can publish advertisements several times. Generally, applicants are required to write their age, native place, education, experience, and required salary. Sometimes photos are required, and sometimes a cover letter is required. The so-called cover letter is to write your name, age, native place, marital status, past resume, and expected remuneration in the letter. When advertising in the newspaper, if you do not want the outside world to know the name of the business organization (to avoid introductions from acquaintances), you can use a post office box, and applicants can send the application letters to the post office box.</p>
<p>B. Job Wanted Column: In the classified advertisements in the newspaper, in addition to the recruitment column, there is also a job wanted column, which can also be paid attention to. But if you want to hire one or two employees, you can look at this job wanted column. It is impossible to hire a large number of employees.</p>
<p>C. Career Guidance Center: The Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society runs a career guidance center, and the Ministry of Social Affairs also runs a job placement center. All job seekers go there to register. If you need staff, asking them to introduce you is also a way.</p>
<p>D. Various schools: When hiring staff, sending letters to various schools and asking the school authorities to recommend introductions is also a way. But this method cannot be applied when recruiting experienced staff, because students who have just come out of school do not have experience in handling affairs.</p>

<h3>Scientific Theory of Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>Literature and art are the forerunners of science. The relationship between science and literature and art has long been recognized by the academic community. It was the Renaissance in Europe that led to the religious revolution and the prosperity of science. This is because literature and art cannot be separated from reality. Only those writers who claim to be "art for art's sake" avoid the ethereal heaven and try to exhaust the subtleties of the universe and human life from a grain of sand, sympathizing with the flowers, plants, insects, and fish in creation, and from sympathy to understanding, from understanding to enlightenment, and treating what they understand and enlighten as the ten rules of night crying and the singing of orioles, just to comfort the loneliness of their souls. As for the general writers who pursue truth, they are not eager to seek their own comfort. Sometimes they do not even care about their own lives. It is because they have focused their entire souls on society, life, and all the realities of joys and sorrows. Their supreme joy is to search for reality, reflect reality, and reveal the secrets of reality and this ultimate goal. Therefore, the spirit of science is clear, correct, to transform the dark reality, radiate the light of truth, and increase the happiness of life, and literature and art are the same.</p>
<p>What is the so-called "artistic conscience"? The most thorough explanation is the spirit of "seeing righteousness and daring to do it, and hating evil like hatred." When writers encounter the dark side of society when dealing with real-world issues, they are not disappointed or pessimistic, but always hold a positive revolutionary attitude, the faith and enthusiasm of religious scholars, and strive to eliminate the factors of darkness; and those elements who hide under the wings of darkness, willingly degenerate, sneak around, and hinder progress are the very factors that should be eliminated. They deeply hate the writers' love of meddling because they cannot allow themselves to hide in a dark corner and enjoy a lewd and shameless life as much as possible, and they must put them to death quickly; this is the same as the scientists' suffering from the killing of the Pope of the Hundred Roman Empire and the persecution of all feudal forces; therefore, the enemies of science are also the enemies of literature and art; and the only thing that enables science to progress smoothly, regardless of everything on the road of science, and takes on the task of clearing away those stumbling blocks, is literature and art. Science is the engine of the times, and literature and art are the driving force for promoting science. The passionate flames of literature and art can burn down the stale shackles of scientists, so that scientists have the freedom to think and the freedom to invent, and finally merge with literature and art, issuing turbulent waves, converging into the main trend of the times, washing away the adverse currents of life, and creating a new century for mankind.</p>
<p>Literature and art can also gain new inspiration from the progress of science. Writers often discover the secrets of the universe and life in the world of science, making the vocabulary richer, the image of the description more realistic, and the ideal pursued more宏远. That is to say, scientists can not dabble in literary and artistic works, but writers can not but accept the baptism of science in order to understand the achievements of science. For example, if we want to describe the changes in the seasons, the obscurity of the sky, the brightness and darkness of the sun, moon, and stars, the rise and fall of plants, flowers, and trees, and the birth and death of insects, fish, birds, and beasts, we cannot be competent if we lack knowledge of natural science. Now the scope of literary and artistic writing has long been free from the shackles of "art for art's sake," expanding from personal lyricism to the description of life, forcing writers to go to all aspects of society to capture the reality of becoming this problem and use it as a topic for answering. Literature and art are eagerly desiring the help of sociology, economics, and history. At the same time, if you want to analyze human nature, dissect life, and point out the bright path for mankind, you must have a good higher and deeper cultivation in philosophy, psychology, and so on. In addition, literary and artistic workers should often leave the writing room and run to the work positions to experience real life in work and learn the active knowledge that cannot be conveyed in books. For example, if you want to write about workers, you have to go directly to factories, farms, and mines to observe their living lives, study their real economic phenomena, and grasp the crux of their pain. In this way, writers really need to browse books on the study of social problems.</p>
<p>Many writers often show the characteristics of their works because they have a more profound cultivation in a certain science and are deeply influenced. For example, the playwright Gao Ertehuasui is a lawyer who is familiar with the law. In the play "Justice," attacking the British prison system shows that he is an expert who understands the secrets, and makes the play attract society's attention during the performance, so that the government has to carry out the improvement of the prison; Chekhov is a student of the medical school, and has research on pathology and anatomy. Therefore, he often uses the description and analysis of mental patients to achieve amazing achievements. In the Tao, it can be seen that scientific thought can not only enrich the content of literature, but also the technical help of literature is also indelible.</p>
<p>Today, when science has developed to the atomic bomb, human civilization must be accompanied by the high progress of science, which has undergone drastic changes, and the changes in life will be like a kaleidoscope, colorful and elusive. Therefore, literary and artistic workers must adapt to the atomic bomb century and meet the new requirements of the new people in the new stage, then in the field of literature and art, they must also change a new set of methods to engage in sowing and cultivation, which is inevitable. In the past, literature and art promoted science, and literature and art were the driving force for promoting science. Now science has run to the front, and literature and art must follow science to catch up and learn again in the world of science! If literary and artistic workers stick to the old ways, are complacent with the existing Chen method, despise everything, and are complacent, they will be drowned in the sea by the wave set off by the new science. 1945, 24 in Chongqing</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>The earth is barren, and the poet plants flowers; mankind is isolated, and the poet builds bridges; society is cold, and the poet brings sunshine; philosophers explore the truth, but the poet sows the truth in people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Winter on the Li River</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>In Guilin's winter, you can't see snowy days. After the clear and crisp autumn, the trees wither with the west wind, and the green mountain peaks turn into a deep black color like blue indigo. The rugged and steep stone walls are all exposed in their original form. The scattered mountain tops near and far stand quietly by the Li River, like an old man waiting for the end of the year, passing away quietly day by day.</p>
<p>The water of the Li River, even in the deep winter, will not freeze a thin layer of ice on the surface. The river water flows clearly and smoothly, past some rocky shores in the cold and lonely shore. The river surface at this time is not as full as the autumn tide of the riverbed.</p>
<p>Standing on the Zhongzheng Bridge or crossing the river in a small folk boat, browsing the mountains and rivers of the Li River in this way will make you feel that the natural scenery in winter is indeed plain and thin. If people are in it and can blend with nature, then the flavor of life's ups and downs will suddenly strike your heart.</p>
<p>Although there is no ice and snow in winter on the Li River, unlike other places, a slight stop on the river bank makes people unbearable to the cold; however, when the Li River arrives in the deep winter, there are very few people on the river and the shore. Only every morning, in the misty rain and the white mist on the river surface, the lead-colored sky presses very low, and only a vague shadow remains of the mountain peaks of the distant river. At this time, three or five bamboo rafts appear on the river in teams. The fishermen wear straw raincoats and slowly row the oars, letting the egrets on the bamboo rafts nimbly dive into the water to catch fish. From morning till night, they come and go at will. This is a small scene that can be seen everywhere on the Li River in winter. Seeing them coming and going leisurely and enjoying themselves, but under the whip of life, how much bitterness and辛辛 do they not know?</p>
<p>The winter of the Li River is beautiful and lonely, followed by disasters after the fire and iron washed away. I think she is even thinner this year!</p>
<h3>Three Poems</h3>
<p>— Ye Shugan</p>
<p>Beside the Bridge</p>
<p>Although the former year's delicate smiles have passed through several blossoming flowers, the sound of frogs, the kind whispers, seem to be still yesterday, that night the blue sky outside the window was shining with stars and moon.</p>
<p>Now, who will make us meet again beside the bridge, under that dim light?</p>
<p>(You have not disappeared, your slender demeanor.)</p>
<p>Tonight, I wipe off the dust from the old mirror.</p>
<p>Unforgettable the traces carefully drawn on that day,</p>
<p>Drunkenness cannot solve frowning brows,</p>
<p>(There is a sad phoenix flute under the corridor.)</p>
<p>Vase Flower</p>
<p>I saw a person's life from the vase flower,</p>
<p>She buds in the greenhouse,</p>
<p>Quickly feels open, quickly withers, and withers.</p>
<p>Picked Up by Chance</p>
<p>The autumn rain dusk, the street lights reflect the hurried steps of the returning people.</p>
<h3>A RECORD OF LIU DAJIE</h3>
<p>— FU JUN</p>
<p>Long ago, twenty years prior, it was a time when the average young literary person was fascinated by new literary works. The works of Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, and Yu Dafu captivated countless young men and women. In particular, Lu Xun's "Nahan" and "Panghuang," Guo Moruo's "Goddess" and "Starry Sky," and Yu Dafu's "Lost Lamb" and "Nine Kinds of Diary," among other brilliant works, were regarded as invaluable treasures by the enthusiastic and devoted literary youth. During this time, there was an Unnamed Society, presided over by Mr. Lu Xun, which published a series of Unnamed Books, and Mr. Liu Dajie's collection of creative works was already included.</p>
<p>Like many writers of that time, Mr. Dajie's creative content was inevitably about expressing the melancholic emotions of young men and women, with the school environment as the main subject of description. However, there were also some realistic short stories about impoverished rural villages at that time. In any case, like most writers of the time, Mr. Dajie's works mostly wrote about the comedies and tragedies of love between men and women. In the early stages, the writing was straightforward, and full of passionate energy, which was a common characteristic of most writers. This was not unique to Mr. Dajie. Over time, the writing evolved from straightforward to refined, and the passion no longer had the uncontrollable momentum of the beginning. In the recent decade, Mr. Dajie's works, in my personal opinion, have been following the same path as Ba Jin. Both are known for their passionate and unrestrained style, but when it comes to a more profound and steady writing attitude, I would first recommend Dajie. Ba Jin is still inevitably too "carefree".</p>
<p>He has a tall and slender figure, an ordinary face, but powerful eyes, a dashing demeanor, and speaks with a Hunan accent. Talking to him, listening to his lectures or speeches, no one is not captivated by his eloquent and inexhaustible conversation. It was probably one summer fifteen years ago, when I transferred from the distant North to Shanghai, and attended his "Literary Trends" and "Selection of Ci Poetry" courses for a few hours in a university classroom. At that time, the scorching sun was like fire, and the wind was nowhere to be seen. But the small classroom was still packed with people, and everyone forgot about the humid and hot weather. No one felt cramped or suffocated because of the crowd and the heat. They just felt that Mr. Dajie's lectures were excellent and very pleasant to listen to, just like a traveler who suddenly finds a spring after a long journey! I still regret that I did not have the fortune to attend more of Mr. Dajie's classes. In fact, I did not study literature, but I had long ago made a wish for literature, which continues to this day.</p>
<p>Mr. Dajie has published many books, published by Zhonghua, Da Dong, Beixin and other publishing houses. He has served as the chief editor of "Modern Student," "Hai Chao" and other publications, and is currently the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts at National Jinan University. In recent years, he seems to have written less, but he has already shifted from literary creation to the work of organizing and editing ancient Chinese books, especially poetry, in which he has many excellent works. Mr. Dajie's wife, Li Huiqun, is also a female writer, who has edited two books, "Selected Poems of Women Through the Ages" and "Selected Ci Poetry of Women Through the Ages," both published by Zhonghua Book Company. She is currently teaching at Shanghai Municipal No. 1 Girls' High School, which is also worth mentioning in passing.</p>
<h3>THE MAGDALEN</h3>
<p>— DI XIANG</p>
<p>Di Xiang (Titian 1482-1576) did not like ordinary academic subjects since childhood, drawing and painting randomly all day long. Finally, he achieved his ambition and became the authoritative painter of the Venetian school. THE MAGDALEN is taken from the Bible – a prostitute. The style is solid, the color is brilliant, the brushstrokes are delicate, and no small part is relaxed. In addition to "Flora," this work can be called representative. (Lion)</p>
<h3>AN INCH OF LAND, AN INCH OF BLOOD 139</h3>
<p>— YE JINGFENG</p>
<p>Indeed, if Tsurumi's plan fails, then everything is in Konoe's hands, whether it's half an hour, an hour, or even ten years. If the plan succeeds, at nine o'clock, the attack has already been preliminarily launched; around ten o'clock, when Tsurumi is about to enter Beppu, the second step of the plan will also be unveiled; a large portion of the troops should have already infiltrated the flower-filled city of Beppu. Then, around eleven o'clock, there should be a major explosion. In other words, if Tsurumi's plan succeeds, everything should be in Tsurumi's hands. Time should be controlled by Tsurumi.</p>
<p>But the fact has already proven that Tsurumi did not control time, but rather was controlled by time; because the long and short hands of his watch both pointed to eleven o'clock. He had been sitting in this magnificent guest room for nearly half an hour. This half hour was really not easy to get through. At first, he looked at his watch every five or six minutes, and within each time interval, countless thoughts churned in his mind: "Why is the street so quiet?" "Can't Anzaka command?" "Will 〇12 mess things up?" "Impossible; if there's any problem, they should give me some news, and they can't leave me hanging in mid-air, swaying back and forth."</p>
<p>The closer it got to the scheduled eleven o'clock, the more frequently Tsurumi looked at his watch; every two minutes, every minute, he looked at his watch again and again. As it approached eleven o'clock, he simply bent his arm, and his eyes were fixed on the dial, watching the small second hand move forward regularly, one step at a time.</p>
<p>"It's over!" The long hand on the watch, perfectly straight, had already pointed to twelve o'clock, the short hand had reached eleven o'clock, and the second hand had moved past the sixty-minute mark. "However…" Tsurumi's ears and temples were buzzing, indicating that his entire nervous system had been overstressed and had undergone drastic changes. Fortunately, there was a small thought shift, "However," which eased the overstressed nerves a little.</p>
<p>"However," what? He thought of the time in his plan, which was not exactly nine o'clock, ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, etc. Because this thing called a clock is reliable and unreliable, there are always some problems with being too fast or too slow, or stopping. Moreover, according to experience, this type of secret work should not be timed too precisely, but only between a few o'clock, or around a few o'clock. The word "around" is not to relax the time limit; it is to say that it is best to be on time, but secret work has some obstacles. In case it is not possible to start on time, the word "around" can slightly relax the time limit. The time for his planned major explosion was "around eleven o'clock."</p>
<p>However, these were also Tsurumi's self-justifications, slightly relaxing his tense mind. According to his usual work habits, he himself would not allow a single second of error. Now that it was eleven o'clock, and no signal had been sent, he realized that things were not going well; the progress of the plan must have had a major setback, or perhaps encountered a major obstacle.</p>
<p>This "around" also has a limit, doesn't it? How far to the left? How far to the right? Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes? It shouldn't exceed fifteen minutes, approximately. But the long hand of his watch had already pointed to one point, and the second hand, annoyingly, still moved forward, one step at a time. Tsurumi could not sit still any longer; he jumped up from the sofa.</p>
<p>Since that secretary Nishihara left this guest room, not a single sound could be heard in the vast city of Beppu. The corridor outside this guest room should logically be the main thoroughfare of this part of the building, but not a single footstep could be heard. Although it was almost midnight, Nishihara clearly said that Konoe was still working; there should be people helping with the work, at least a few people serving, but why was there not a single sound? The only explanation was that Nishihara's words might be a smokescreen; or perhaps Konoe's office was not in this part of the building?</p>
<p>Could he not run outside the guest room to snoop around? At least he could walk to the door and eavesdrop near the crack in the door. This he could not do; and absolutely must not do. According to Tsurumi's complex and alert mind, if his plan did not fail, and things were progressing steadily, perhaps there would be a slight delay of eight or ten minutes, which would be possible, and there would be no need for him to snoop around or eavesdrop. On the other hand, if things were not going well, and the plan had failed, he would be under house arrest here; perhaps there were eyes watching his every move on the walls. If he acted recklessly, there would definitely be even more unpleasant consequences.</p>
<p>He could only pace back and forth in the empty space of the room; this was an inevitable action after sitting for a long time, and could not be criticized. Why was he looking at his watch all the time? He could also answer: because Nishihara said that Konoe would be working for more than half an hour, and he was looking at his watch just to know if the time had arrived. These actions were not out of line. However, to go out to snoop around or eavesdrop by the door crack, although he could still argue strongly, at least he would lose the status of a gentleman and a soldier.</p>

<h3>SAN MAO</h3>
<p>— ZHANG LEPING</p>
<h3>AMNESTY</h3>
<p>— SHAO FU</p>
<p>The National Government announced an amnesty decree on New Year's Day. After reading its contents, it was felt that the scope of amnesty was very broad. Except for those who committed treason, corruption, or killed direct ascendants, or those who were sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment for opium and drugs, the remaining crimes were reduced by one-half or generally pardoned. Therefore, some people are calculating that the criminals in the grain loan case can be pardoned, the chief criminal in the Yanshi case can be spared death, and something can be reduced by half... This kind of speculation is naturally very well-founded, and these prisoners are very fortunate to be able to feel this once-in-a-thousand-years grace.</p>
<p>Originally, the National Government had the possibility of issuing an amnesty decree on New Year's Day last year, the first New Year's Day after the victory. The reason for delaying it for a year may be that the victory had just arrived, and everything was in a state of chaos. In addition, the investigation and trial of war criminals and traitors, and the reorganization of the judicial organs in various occupied areas, had not yet been carried out. Now, these issues have come to an end, and the constitution has been officially announced on New Year's Day. It is very appropriate to issue this supreme grace at this time!</p>
<p>No matter how many people will benefit from this grace in the future, we believe that the judicial organs should let those who are granted amnesty understand the government's intention in issuing this special pardon. If they are released in a muddleheaded manner, it will not only lack solemnity, but also easily encourage people's侥幸之心 (侥幸之心: a fluke mentality).</p>
<h3>SKETCHES OF TEN MAJOR ANIMALS IN AMERICA'S LARGEST ZOO</h3>
<p>— BAO ZHONGQI</p>
<p>In the past fifty years, ninety-six million tourists have visited the Bronx Zoo in New York, USA, and it is said that they all came to see the true faces of the ten major animals. Here, we will list these ten major animals in order of the tourists' ratings:</p>
<p>Miss Panda</p>
<p>The first place winner is our country's "honor product" - Miss Panda. Her walking posture is like a bear. Countless adults and children surround her, because she is the most interesting and the rarest and most precious animal – (in the mountains of distant China, only eight have been hunted, half of which were given to the United States). Pandas are now highly respected in the United States, and the delicacies they eat are tender bamboo from Florida.</p>
<p>Gibbon</p>
<p>The second place winner is the gibbon nicknamed "Mother". She shelters her fifteen-month-old "Junior" and does not allow people to take pictures. If you insist on taking pictures, she will consider you malicious and glare at the camera. She is sometimes very lively, but sometimes she is very melancholy and stubborn. She has a strange temper, that is, she is unwilling to drink water in the water trough, and would rather dip her finger in it to eat.</p>
<p>Sea Lions</p>
<p>The third place winners are two sea lions. They have roared to eat lunch, or yelled to amuse guests. Their skin color is very bright, and they are good at opening their mouths to ask you for fish to eat.</p>
<p>Gorilla</p>
<p>The fourth place winner is Makoao - a gorilla. This is a very violent animal in appearance. His frown and wrinkled nose show his strict and stubborn personality. His walking attitude is also like a person.</p>
<p>Gentle Elephant</p>
<p>The fifth place winner is the gentle elephant. His body is as big as a tree trunk, which makes people laugh. His large and movable ears are like a peanut plant. Of the three here, two are from India and one is African.</p>
<p>Black-footed Penguin</p>
<p>The sixth place winner is the black-footed penguin - that fish-eating animal. People are often kicked by him, because he can also stand upright and walk like a person. He has a white "tie", but with an extra tail.</p>
<p>Hummingbird</p>
<p>The seventh place winner is the hummingbird. His long beak and beautiful wings attract many tourists. He is fed homemade sweet nectar in the zoo.</p>
<p>Mountain Lions</p>
<p>The eighth place winners are two mountain lions. Their movements are very soft and elegant, and they are very smart, or rather cunning, using tricks to play with humans.</p>
<p>Lion</p>
<p>The ninth place winner is a lion. He is not very clever, but in fact almost everyone likes him, because his appearance is so smart and beautiful, noble and generous, especially his roar, which is even more moving.</p>
<p>Spider</p>
<p>The tenth place winner is the "black widow spider", which also attracts the interest of many tourists. Although poisonous, she does not hurt people, so many people like to approach her.</p>
<p>After translating the above passage, we cannot help but feel infinite emotion for the zoos in China (especially Shanghai).</p>
<h3>THE WORLD-RENOWNED SCOTTISH POLICE</h3>
<p>— JIAN HUA</p>
<p>Abridged and translated from this issue of World Weekly</p>
<p>The name of the Scottish Police Headquarters has spread to various countries. Their quick handling of cases and the mystery of arresting criminals are indeed unbelievable. The general public calls them "tiger traps", which is of considerable value.</p>
<p>Underground Work</p>
<p>The Scottish Police Headquarters is the general command of the British police. Important British institutions are protected by the Bureau, which has great power and is directly under the Ministry of the Interior, and is not subject to the control of local officials. The headquarters is located on the banks of the Thames River, with magnificent buildings, eight floors high, and more than a thousand offices. Tunnels are opened underground, leading in all directions. The entrances and exits of the tunnels are either car companies, movie theaters, or department stores. People only see that the front of the headquarters is very quiet, but they do not know that the cars in the tunnels are busy and never stop. It is truly mysterious.</p>
<p>Strict and Complete</p>
<p>The police headquarters has about 30,000 people, one director-general, one deputy director-general, 220 police officers, and 3,008 patrol officers. There are departments for defense, maintenance, detective work, editing, inspection, justice, and telegraph. Each department has a director who is responsible for handling the affairs of the department. The defense department is responsible for defending against the other party's assassinations or attacks. The guns are strong, and the equipment is complete, no different from an elite army. The maintenance department is responsible for maintaining local order and correcting illegal assemblies and organizations. The police in this department do not carry weapons on weekdays, and their attitude is very kind. The detective department is responsible for seeking clues and investigating secrets. There are many people, most of whom are scattered in the industrial and commercial circles, taking the opportunity to spy, and the news is well-informed. The editing department is responsible for editing various newspapers. There are several kinds of daily newspapers, evening newspapers, weekly newspapers, and police reports. The printing expenses each year are also amazing. The inspection department is responsible for chemical testing of poisonous substances and studying the reasons for the victim's death. The fingerprint item alone has more than 25,000 kinds, which is very detailed. The other departments are also tightly organized and extremely complete.</p>
<p>The above seven departments are independent institutions. The seven departments are connected by a seven-person conference. The so-called seven people are the directors of the seven departments. If there are major cases or difficult problems, the seven-person conference will be held. Everyone will discuss them in detail, cooperate with each other, and strive to get to the bottom of the case and find out the truth.</p>
<p>Quick Case Solving</p>
<p>Most police officers are equipped with wireless radios in their pockets and use secret codes. If an unexpected event such as a robbery or a mob riot occurs, the news will reach all places within the range of the radio waves within five minutes. They can immediately cut off the main roads or dispatch large numbers of troops to provide assistance. Therefore, the scene of the incident will become a dragnet in an instant, and the bandits will have nowhere to escape.</p>
<p>To the left of the police headquarters is a lost and found office. Large items such as car trunks and small items such as a nail or a button, expensive items such as gold bars and gems, and cheap items such as old clothes and socks, are stored in the lost and found office. People who come to claim them are endless, like a department store.</p>
<p>To the right of the police headquarters is an exhibition hall. There are all kinds of things such as thieves' weapons, photos, counterfeit banknotes, extortion letters, disguises, narcotics, and clothing items. Each exhibit is accompanied by a description card, stating the year and month, the cause of the case, and detailed records. Therefore, writers who write detective novels regard the institute as a wholesale place for novel materials.</p>

<h3>Life is Too Short, Why Bother About Trivial Matters!</h3>
<p>— CHUNLIANG, translated from "This Week's Digest"</p>
<p>"Life is too short, why bother about trivial matters," this is my most beloved motto, which has helped me through many painful experiences. Often, we let ourselves be upset by trivial matters that should be ignored and forgotten. Or because the man we helped is ungrateful to us... Or because the woman we thought was a friend is talking behind our backs... Or because the reward we thought was sure to belong to me was obtained by others. Things like these make us feel very disappointed, so much so that we can't work or sleep. But isn't that ridiculous? Here, we only have decades to live in this world, and we feel that many irreplaceable times have been lost to thinking about those unnecessary worries, and after a year, that matter will be forgotten by us and by anyone else. Let us dedicate our own lives to valuable work and emotions, to great thoughts, true love, and earth-shattering careers! Because life is too short, why bother about trivial matters!</p>
<h3>YOUNG DIPLOMAT, SOVIET UNION'S NEW FOREIGN MINISTER, GROMYKO</h3>
<p>— MISHAN</p>
<p>The Soviet Council of Ministers recently appointed Gromyko as Deputy Foreign Minister—the familiar Soviet young diplomat, the current Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>With a handsome, slender build, jet-black hair, and always wearing a dark blue, crisp suit, with a shirt and French-style collar, Gromyko is one of the youngest and most handsome in the Security Council, only thirty-eight years old this year. Journalists are accustomed to calling him "the person who doesn't express opinions," because he has never expressed any opinions to reporters who ask him questions at meetings or banquets. Occasionally, he will answer reporters with two sentences: "The weather is not bad today," or something of the sort that doesn't make sense, or when a photographer asks to take a picture of him, he will nod and smile faintly. In addition, he is indeed a "person who does not express opinions" on more important events.</p>
<p>He is a member of the Supreme Soviet and has been awarded the Order of Lenin twice. He is now a confidant of Marshal Stalin and an important figure in the Communist Party. His career in the Soviet Union can be said to be smooth sailing. After graduating from the Moscow Institute of Economics, he worked as a teacher for two years, and at the age of thirty, he became the director of the American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After working for not long, he was sent to the Soviet Embassy in the United States as an advisor. In 1943, he was appointed as the Soviet Ambassador to the United States.</p>
<p>The first time he represented the Soviet Union at an international conference was at the Teheran Conference after he took office as ambassador; the second time was at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 (he was the middle seat of the Soviet delegation to the conference); the third time was this United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>His consistent diplomatic technique in the Security Council is to add the Soviet interpretation to the United Nations Charter and criticize Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States for endangering peace. Therefore, the Security Council has produced many thorny issues. Of course, this cannot be attributed to Gromyko alone, but his suspicion of the "Western countries uniting to defeat the Soviet Union" is undoubtedly very strong. He said at the Security Council's discussion of the Iranian issue: "Recently, some elements have been using the Soviet-Iranian relationship to stir up the world's political atmosphere to help the actions of certain groups and advocate the creation of a new war." He even stormed out of the meeting over the Iranian issue.</p>
<p>Like other Soviet ambassadors, he usually does not attend banquets very much, but likes to play ball and play chess. He speaks extremely fluent English, but in public places, he only speaks Russian and never uses English. He often corrects sentences that have been translated incorrectly by translators.</p>
<p>He has a seventeen-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter, and the family is harmonious. In a hotel in New York, he does not eat American cuisine very much, but often teaches his wife to cook Russian peasant dishes.</p>
<p>(Translated from the December 1946 issue of "Happiness Magazine")</p>
<h3>WIT</h3>
<p>— ZHONG QI</p>
<p>Dr. Zheng Zhangcheng, Dean of the College of Science at Shanghai University, is a biologist. His answer to the question of "Is there a conflict between science and religion?" is the most humorous and meaningful. He said:</p>
<p>I can illustrate it with just one example. For example, studying flower cultivation is science; but the flowers in the bride's hands and the wreaths in the family of the deceased are religion.</p>
<h3>EVERLASTING SONG</h3>
<p>— YUAN PING</p>
<p>Articles are "refined after poverty"; music is probably also necessarily "poor" before it becomes "refined". Therefore, the members of the Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra need to taste the taste of "chronic hunger". When they perform in the future, it will definitely become an "everlasting song."</p>
<h3>COINCIDENCE</h3>
<p>— FANG WEN</p>
<p>Three planes crashed in Shanghai in one day, and then another one came to Qingdao - "said to be a natural disaster."</p>
<p>On the fifth of last month, the Jiangwan Arsenal exploded, and on the sixth of the same month, the US military arsenal in Qingdao had an accident - "this is a man-made disaster."</p>
<p>Three hundred homeless children had a grand feast hosted by the US military on Christmas Day. The lucky brother Wang was deeply grateful to have escaped death. - "Everyone is happy."</p>
<p>Dr. Wang, 64, married Ms. Zhou, 52, in Shanghai; Dr. Dewey, 87, married Mrs. Grant, 42, in New York - "Old age brings joy."</p>
<p>The price of gold in Shanghai rises and falls by hundreds of thousands a day, and dozens of stores close down every day in various places - "Some are happy, some are sad"?</p>
<p>THIS TIME, THIS PLACE</p>
<h3>CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC</h3>
<p>— FANG WEN</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, the restaurants in this city were still open for business, but on each glass window of his gate, a large red paper was pasted with the words:</p>
<p>"Please go to another store, our store is full every day, the boss also said that he has not made money, and does not give us employees a year-end bonus."</p>
<p>Labor-management disputes in Shanghai have changed from strikes to slowdowns, and from slowdowns to opening the door to thank guests.</p>
<h3>WINTER DEFENSE</h3>
<p>— BAO ZHE</p>
<p>Yesterday I heard that a robbery occurred on Road, and the bandits were as many as eighteen, and they were all holding new weapons. Two policemen were disarmed by them. Fortunately, there were only two, if there were more, they could be compared with foreign "sharpshooters".</p>
<p>The end of the year is approaching, and it is the time when bandits are rampant. The security authorities should pay special attention!</p>
<h3>VETERANS</h3>
<p>— XIAO ZHI</p>
<p>The veterans in the wounded soldiers' hospital only receive 100 yuan for vegetable expenses and 200 yuan for pork and nutrition expenses every day. Three meals a day, 100 yuan per meal, what can they buy to maintain their nutrition!</p>
<h3>Love the Country, Respect the National Flag</h3>
<p>— Wu Daquan</p>
<p>In Shanghai, whenever a new store opens, it is customary to put up a national flag, a red glow, full of joy, considered an auspicious start.</p>
<p>This time, with the opening of the United Bazaar, it couldn't escape this custom either. Moreover, because the bazaar is called "United," the number of stores is more than just one. Therefore, the national flags hoisted were also more than one, fluttering in the wind, a grand sight. Regardless of Japanese rain, there are no taboos.</p>
<p>If the United Bazaar were promoting domestic goods, then hoisting a dozen or so national flags could be justified on the grounds of advocating for domestic products. However, using the national flag as a mere decoration for a commercial place always feels a little inappropriate.</p>
<p>The national flag is the symbol of a country, representing the nation. It should not be misused, and should be diligently respected and cherished. However, most Chinese people are casual and careless about their own national flag. No wonder traitors even use the national flag to be buried with them.</p>
<p>Various Matters</p>
<h3>"Sai Jinhua"</h3>
<p>— Da Bing</p>
<p>A group of local "notables" in Beiping, in order to collect anecdotes about Sai Jinhua's life, specially advertised in newspapers to find Sai's former old maid, Gu Jiangshi. Recently, a certain organization conducted a poverty relief survey and discovered that this 66-year-old former maid of a famous courtesan had fallen into destitution and was in dire circumstances. Currently, the "notables" have launched a large-scale relief effort to aid in the "research" work. The "notables'" elegant interests are indeed profound! We deeply cheer for the salvation of a dying old woman!</p>
<h3>"The Heist of the Treasury"</h3>
<p>— Ye Cao</p>
<p>The new Hollywood movie "The Heist of the Treasury" narrates the adventurous experiences of a thief, its main theme being to showcase the "international" effort to prohibit the trafficking of narcotics. Columbia Pictures will use Shanghai as the backdrop for the film. The film plans to shoot scenes of "The Bund," "the old Public Concession streetscape," "the vicinity of the old Japanese Consulate," and "several shots will focus on rickshaw sheds." Wait and see, the magnificent scenery of the grand city of Shanghai will soon be unfolded before the eyes of people all over the world!</p>
<h3>"The Most Precious Thing in the World"</h3>
<p>— Sui</p>
<p>Reports say that recently, merchant ships sailing from Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other northern ports have been smuggling drugs. Those who are aware and provide shelter can receive a cut of the profits. It is said that the "liaison fee" for each large ship to avoid inspection is one million yuan, while for smaller ships, it ranges from 100,000 to 300,000 yuan. Therefore, after the drugs arrive at the port, they can remain safe and sound. Money! Money! The most precious thing in the world. With you, everything is settled!</p>
<h3>"Safety"</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Philippine Airlines is launching direct flights from Shanghai to Manila and San Francisco. The advertisement in the newspaper touts three major features. Under the "Safety" section, it says "All American flight crew." But if we try to read the list of the crew who died in the recent China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane crash, what would we think?</p>
<h3>After "Abstention"</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>The Atomic Energy Commission has passed the United States' proposal and has submitted the report to the Security Council. According to the United States' proposal, an international organization should be established to control atomic energy and be given great power to supervise whether countries are using atomic energy appropriately. Major powers in this international organization should not use the "veto power." When punishing countries that violate the atomic treaty, it is not necessary to obtain unanimous consent from all countries. The Soviet Union naturally opposes the removal of the "veto power" and is especially strongly opposed to establishing a supervisory system, fearing that someone will discover the secrets within its country. However, when the Atomic Energy Commission voted on the United States' proposal, it did not directly and frankly cast a vote of opposition, but rather lukewarmly abstained. Abstention? This implies a lot, and perhaps many good shows will be staged from this "abstention."</p>
<h3>Legacy of the Imperialist Era</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Just as the new year begins, Vietnam is staging a full-scale martial performance. One moment, the Viet Minh forces bombard Hanoi, the next, the French government declares a military solution, then French reinforcements arrive in Saigon, then French officials arrive in Vietnam to investigate, then the French government declares a military solution again, and then there are reports of peace negotiations… a tortuous process, truly exhausting the ability to twist and change. Everyone knows that the Blum Cabinet is quite progressive and is a transitional government with a term of only a few weeks. Now it is actually doing this in Vietnam, which is somewhat unexpected. France, on the one hand, constantly shouts about progress, but on the other hand, still longs for the legacy of the imperialist era. The demonstration of human selfishness is most nakedly expressed in this place.</p>
<h3>Why the Misfortune of Being Born into an Imperial Family?</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>The love story between Princess Elizabeth, the heir to the British throne, and Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, was previously rumored for a while, but now it is in full swing. The British Cabinet recently held a special meeting to discuss the princess's lifelong affair and decided to consult with the various dominions of the British Empire, as carefully as possible. But the future is uncertain. If unfortunately, it suffers a setback, and her heart is broken, how will she handle herself? Will she follow in the footsteps of the Duke of Windsor and sacrifice everything for love? Or will she reluctantly comply with the national code? The love of a royal daughter is not as free as that of a commoner's daughter. The "above all" love is actually enslaved by politics. Is this a tradition that should be maintained or an outdated custom that needs to be reformed? "Why the misfortune of being born into an imperial family?"</p>
