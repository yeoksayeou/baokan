<h3>我出席聯大代表團　王外長等今日飛美　對日和約問題將有洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕王外長等一行昨下午二時四十五分由京抵滬，定今晨六時半，搭泛美航空公司班機赴美預定中途降落檀香山，然後再飛抵舊金山，休息一二日，再赴紐約。馮今白，周謙冲兩氏，則已於昨日搭船赴美。據有關人士語記者，聯大會期雖長達兩月，但王外長因部務覊身，將於一個月內返國，隨行人員中可能留一兩人在美，處理一切。此次王外長因赴美之便，可能與有關國家之首長協商對日和約問題。根據今年六月遠東委員會之決議觀察，各國對於和約之寬嚴程度，觀點並無重大出入，故問題可能不在和約之本身，而在和約之執行。惟在和約成立之後，執行者將非美國一國，而爲由各國成立管制機構，加以監督執行。又關於大連問題是否提出聯合國大會一，節，我人尙未考慮及之。因大連之情勢，舉世均已明瞭，而苦於無解決問題之方案。此時提出大會，無補實際，反可能延遲解決問題之速度，但一切需視實際情勢而定，此時尙不能斷言是否提出。</p>
<p>外長發表談話　贊成合理解釋否決權</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕王外長昨發表談話如下：</p>
<p>聯合國此屆大會，即將商討之重要問題之一爲否決權問題，與此問題有關之修改聯合國憲章一案，被列入該會臨時議程。我政府以如此一重要問題之解決，在於就憲章中所定之否決權設法成立一般合理之解釋，取得各方協議，而不在憲章本身之修正，且修改憲章在目前亦殊鮮實現可能。予以爲聯合國創設迄今，尙有未得到充分試騐之機會，余認爲此項機會應給予聯合國國。</p>
<p>中國政府對於目前修改憲章之可能性，雖不無懷疑，然對於齊章中否決權之合理解釋，因以限制其使用，則準備充分尊重大會之多數意見。當舊金山會議於一九四五年通過聯合國憲章之時，召開該會議之中，美，英，蘇四强，曾就此事發表共同解釋，遇必要時中國政府並擬對於變更該項解釋之建議，予以贊助。</p>
<p>至召開對日和會問題，顯非大會職權範圍以內之事，然余仍願藉余在紐約之便，與一切與對日媾和直接有關各國領袖就對日和約問題交換意見。本年七月，中國政府曾就美國關於召開對日預備曾議之建議，聲明對於該項會議內所適用之否決權，如其他各國均能贊同，則中國政府願作若干談步，但中國曾明白聲明，如蘇聯政府拒絕參加美國所提議之會議，則中國將對此事，重予考慮其立塲。</p>
<p>現在有人談論單獨媾和。中國認爲我們不可輕作放棄某些國家之合作而單獨與日本媾和之擬議。吾人努力之目的應該是訂立利於全體盟國而且爲全體盟國所共同支特之和約。因爲，惟有此種和約，始能使吾人充分享受和平之益。至任何國家，均不應對於此一目的之實現，肆爲不合理之阻梗，自不待言。關於負責起草對日和約之機構，其組織及程序，余認爲不妨以遠東委員會之組織與程序爲方式。在此遠東委員會中、凡直接與日本作戰之十一國，不只是中，美，蘇，英四國均有代表參加，同時英，美，中，蘇等四强對於會內各議決案，仍各保有否決權。此一方式，或其他類似方式，應可應用於對日和約起草預備會議，以打破目前此事之僵局。外長會議中關於對德和約所適用之否決權制度，誠然不無可議，但對義，羅，保，匈，芬五國和約，係在此同一制度之下而成立，吾人對於此事實，亦不應忽視。此外，依照上文所述程序，遠東委員會亦曾就盟國對日基本政策，成立全體一致之決議案。嬴取和平，自係艱鉅大業。吾人均應凖備爲此艱鉅大業而努力奮鬥，爲此所爲之努力奮鬥，應不减於百戰勝敵人時所爲努力奮鬥，抑或過之。</p>
<h3>英議會訪華國　十月六日抵京</h3>
<p>我將以國賓禮待之</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕頃悉：英國議會訪華團，定九月底啓程來華，在華期預定爲四周，我政府將以國賓禮待之，茲探得其在華日程大略如次：預定十月三日可抵港，六日抵南京，在京略作勾留，至十一日飛平·津·滬·漢·渝·靑·瀋·台等地觀光，十一月一日返京，留二日，三日轉廣州·香港返英</p>
<h3>牯嶺一雨成秋　游客紛作歸計</h3>
<p>谷正鼎鄭彥棻返京</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕此間昨夜大雨後氣候驟凉，今晨室溫七十二度，已有秋意，山上遊客紛作歸計，定週內下山者已達三百餘人。主席夫婦五日未出遊，蔣夫人下午六時於官邸召宴　山管理局西籍顧問安穩，另有在山西籍人士五人作陪。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕谷正鼎。鄭彥棻五日于應召再謁主席後上午十時離牯飛京。</p>
<h3>處理在外存款</h3>
<p>將循外交途徑進行</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕關於動用國人在外存款事，監院前曾決定派監事楊迺儒等赴財部澈査六中全會決議案執行情形，惟自「中華民國人民存放國外外匯資產申報登記條例草案」經全經委會通過後，此事似已無庸再加澈査。目前國人在外資產能否處理，唯一癥結僅在外國是否予我協助。聞當局不久將再循外交途徑，與各有關國家治商。</p>
<h3>三十七年度　施政方針案　政院不予討論</h3>

<h3>參駐會提請政府　派監委監察選政　內長強調改革地方政治</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕內長張厲生五日在參會駐委會報吿內政措施後，參政員薛明劍，伍純武等均對當前辦理選務問題提出質詢，其中着重於選舉舞弊及地方政治問題，對大選前刷淸地方政治改組地方政府等質詢尤多。張氏答覆時，强調改革地方政府之決心，並謂渠前曾建議當局更調若干省府主席，即因欲達到修明政治之目的，同時，渠表示懲辦舞弊，杜絕貪汚，已具決心。至于選務，必使其能如期達成任務，如遇有地方官包庇情事，凡經査覺後，決予懲辦。關於綏靖區選舉推行事，張氏稱於本月十五前將就綏區作一詳盡報吿，呈送國府請作指示，俾便辦理，旋通過尹述賢等對監選之提案，案由如次：擬請政府特派監院監委分赴各選區監察選政，以樹憲政良好基礎，決議送請政府迅速辦理。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕參政會駐會委員會五日上午九時假國大會堂舉行第四次會議，邵秘書長力子宣讀外交部書面報吿後，張內長作內政報吿並答覆質詢，嗣各參政員更提出詢問及建議多起，均經張氏據實答復，旋即進行提案討論，當通過外交部提出之書面報吿。</p>

<h3>滬工商界重要人士　聯合致電美國當局　說明世界動盪中我國處境　願仍本同情友誼促進合作</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕昨日下午五時，本市工商各界重要人士潘公展，徐寄廎等假座市商會會議室開會，就魏德邁調査團離華後之中，美局勢有所商討，結果，決即日聯名致電美國總統，國務卿及國會領袖。表達重要意見，茲探錄該電全文如下：</p>
<p>敝國人民對於貴國政府派遣魏德邁事實調査團來華，深表感謝。吾人所引以爲　者，當魏特使留華期間，吾人均未有機會面陳意見，吾人茲特代表敝國主要工商各業，敬陳所見，以供諸公之考慮。</p>
<p>吾人並不欲粉飾敝國今日極可痛心之情况，但吾人以爲，敝國之局勢，應自整個戰後世界普遍失調之景象觀察之，夫以英國之紀律謹嚴，且戰時其國土從未遭敵人之蹂躪，而今日之處境若何？法國。意大利，希臘及其他東歐國家之情形又若何？抑即以南美國家爲例，貴總統及貴國務卿甫往出席泛美會議而吿成功者，此等國家旣均未受戰禍，兩年前且尙擁有大量之美元超收，而今日之情形又若何？</p>
<p>敝國於珍珠港事變前四年餘，即已對日作戰，兩年前之今日，當世界大戰結束之時，吾人又慘遭中國共產然之破壞與叛亂，由於此種種因素，若情勢不若今日之嚴重，世人或反將引以爲異矣。</p>
<p>蔣主席以其卓越之領導，旣使中‘國於艱困之抗日戰爭中獲致勝利，則敝國人民與政府自必仍在其領導之下，作繼續不斷之努力，求取改革與進步。但吾人認爲，中國問題，決不能單獨視之，而當視爲戰後世界普遍病象之一部份。若徒在象牙塔中作求全之責備，未必於任何方而有所裨補。貴國對於敝國及其困難，素表廣泛之同情，吾人深信並希望貴國必能繼續保持其友誼之援助態度。</p>
<p>上海市參議會議長潘公展，上海市商會理事長徐寄廎，全國棉紡工業同業公會聯合會理事長杜鏞，全國銀行公會理事長李銘，全國銀行公會常務理事趙棣華，全國銀行公會秘書長李韌哉，上海錢業公會理事長沈日新，上海信託業同業公會理事畏齊致，中國工商協會常務理事壽景偉，中國工商協會秘書長王祖廉，全國輪船商業同業公會常務理事徐學禹，全國工業協會理事長吳蘊初，上海造紙工業同業公會理事長金潤庠，上海絲織工業同業公會理事長蔡昕濤，上海機器染織工業同業公會理事長潘士浩，上海電工器材同業公會理事長胡西園，中國茶葉協會常務理事駱淸華。</p>
<h3>五駄會再聯電中樞　請增加國代名額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海。南京。漢口。靑島市參議會及瀋陽市臨參會，前曾聯合向行政。立法兩院建議，「直轄市國大代表，應以每區產生一名，並於每十名中分配婦女一名，」此案迄今未經准照辦理，故昨日此五參議會再行聯電蔣主席及孫副主席，請即提付國務會議採納，並另電其他北平·天津、·廣州·西安·大連。哈爾濱·重慶等七直轄市，徵求一致主張。其電蔣主席及孫副主席之原文，先舉人口密度，國民代表行使政權之效能等四項理由，作「直轄市不能與縣市視爲同等區域」之辨正。繼稱「竊以憲法雖未明文規定直轄市國大代表名額，依如何方式計算，然證諸傳統習慣，直轄市之「區」，得解釋爲縣之同等區域，我國各直轄市區一級之人口數，如南京青島市，平均皆在十萬人左右，已超過內地各省之一縣，上海則大半在二十萬人之譜，事實上全國各縣人口，數在二十萬人以下者，將以千計，故直轄市之區，應釋爲憲法第二十六條一款「縣市及其同等區域」之同等區域，每區產生國民大會代表一名，方合乎憲法之正解，前經本會等一致主張，直轄市國大代表，應以每區產生一名，並於每十名中分配婦女一名，電請行政立法兩院採納，惜尙未蒙准照辦理，理合再行瀝陳得失，聯名電請鈞府鑒核，俯賜提交國務會議採納，修改現行國民大會代表選舉罷免法及名額分配表等，確定直轄市之區，爲憲法第二十六條一款縣市之同等區域，每區產生國大代表一名，藉符憲法之正解，而慰市民之喁望，是否有當，並祈迅賜示遵。」</p>
<h3>伊寗破壞新疆和平　張治中嚴詞質問　致函阿合買提江及賴希木江</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化五日急電〕新省自上月　合　　江副主席與賴希木江副廳長相繼不辭而去，局勢日趨沉　。頃悉：西北行轅主任張治中將軍，曾爲此致函阿，賴兩人，首述渠爲執行中央旣定政策，給予新疆人民以和平，民主，自由及一切應享之權利，自和平條款簽訂之後，我方業已忠實履行，但伊寗方面不特對和平條款毫無誠意履行，而且製造許多慘案，許多糾紛。最近竟策動反對麥斯武德為主席。又發動吐魯番。鄯善。托克遜三縣暴動，並指出其毫無祖國觀念之事實，發展其所謂「東土耳其斯坦一運動，策動和蘇蘇反漢。再就今後應有的共同做法，提出原則五點：（一）澈底履行和平條款，雙方忠實檢討過去之是非得失。（二）以省委　詞及本省施政綱領所規定之「保障全省和平，擁護國家統一，實行民主政洽，加强民族團結」爲精神基礎，推動三民主義新新張之建設。（三）放棄一派控制，達到特殊的政治企圖，擁護民主領導，促進民主政治之實現。（四）應放棄政治鬥爭，積極進行經濟，敎育，文化各項建設，以符合全疆人民之願望。（五）擁護國家統一，並促進中蘇親善。最後向伊方提出嚴峻之質問：（一）伊方委員完全撤退，是否要片面撕毀和平條款，宣吿無一效？（二）如伊方片面撕毀和平條款，是否凖備再一次武裝　亂，波壞和平，是否願負違反就職誓詞「保障全省和平」之責任，「願受天理與國法之制裁」？（三）如無上述兩種意思，是否願再回迪化開誠商談，覓取合理合法解決「切問題之辦法，全文四千餘字，詞嚴義正，但仍隨處流露涵容寬大之意。此項函件聞已於前日發出。</p>
<h3>新聞紙雜誌等</h3>
<p>規定自動縮減篇幅</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕政院五日通過公布之新聞紙，雜誌及書籍用紙節約辦法，原文如次：</p>
<p>第一條　各地報紙關於新聞及廣吿之編排，應力求節約篇幅，原在一張以上者，均應於本辦法公布後，自動縮减爲一張。其原在二張以上者，（不得超過二張。</p>
<p>第二條　各地雜誌篇幅，應依照下述規定。一，週刊，每期以十六頁爲度，二，半月刊，每期以卅二頁為度，三，月刋以上，以六十四頁爲度，前項頁數，均以單面計算，封皮可另加四頁。</p>
<p>第三條　新聞紙雜誌及書籍，應儘量採用國產紙張。</p>
<p>第四條　內政部得根據事實需要，酌量調劑各地新聞紙雜誌之數量，期於節約之中，並收均衡文化發展之實效。</p>
<p>第五條　無充分資金，固定地址之新聞紙雜誌，並應嚴格限制其登記。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕新聞紙節約辦法中，規定各地報紙能自動縮减篇幅，有人詢甘秘書長以此項辦法如不强迫，如何能即行，甘氏答，盼能自動做到。</p>
<h3>營業性舞廳　月內完全禁止</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕禁止營業性舞場辦法，五日在政務會中討論甚久，若干委員咸認：為「跳舞」之舉，東西洋風俗有異，如在歐美，凡自戰塲歸來之征人，必先歡舞通宵。寗願今日盡情歡樂，明日戰死再說，然在我國則不然，一般社會視聽逈異，尤以營業性舞塲風氣不好，故經熱烈討論後決在九月底前一個月內完全禁止。</p>
<h3>日本紡織工業　列入賠償物資</h3>
<p>我向遠東委會力爭</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕關於日紡織工業必須列入賠償物資之建議，我政府已電令駐美大使顧維鈞，正式向遠東委會提出，並予力爭。</p>
<h3>中蘇中緬中韓　邊界勘查隊</h3>
<p>定十月初由京出發</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕內部爲愼重勘察我國防邊界，特會同國防，外交兩部組成勘査隊，定十月初出發中蘇，中緬，中韓等未定界處，實地勘察，以爲訂立永久疆界之參考。</p>
<h3>日原料資金兩缺　無大量貨品輸出　開放貿易實即等於易貨</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕負責方面稱：對日開放貿易，並不如外間顧慮嚴重，而日本方面亦無大量貨品可作海外之輸出，情形如下：（一）此次開放日本貿易，盟總僅准外商赴日，並未准日商出國推銷貨物，日商無法在他國市塲活動。（二）日現時原料資金兩缺，生產能力降低，無大量貨物可資出口，遑論傾銷。且日貨價格由盟總嚴格管制，自難與他國競爭。（三）日本輸出貨物，可以現金購得者，不過海產，竹漆器皿及其他消耗品，所有機器及重要五金材料，均須以輸入日本之原料交換，名爲開放貿易，實等易貨。（四）就過去一年我國對日易貨及在日換取物資困難情形視之，中日貿易之展開，殊少樂觀。依據去年我尙欠日方相當易貨資金，今年雖未結算，但爲數當必增加，採購不易，貿易與賠償不同，必先以其所需要物資輸往，而後始能換取我准許輸入物資回國。</p>

<h3>今日暹羅　（續昨日第一）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員吳嘉棠</p>
<p>和一　新式的現代的建築物相映成　的是那王宮和許多舊式的廟宇。王宮和多數廟宇外全都銀金，在陽光反射下輝煌奪目。記者參觀王宮時，看見許多完全中國式的傢具和裝飾。王座的形式像一隻出航的帆船，或許是表示第一代暹羅國臘式白色大理石砌成的國會大厦，恰恰和王宮成為一個有趣的對照。這座大理石國會大厦是曼谷的另一建築物，特為顯示暹羅的進步和民主精神的。</p>
<p>暹羅的表面上的現代性也許就是暹羅政府的特性。暹羅政府，像首都曼谷一樣，具備了所有足以表示進步精神的外表徵象。然而實際上儘管有着新的憲法，暹羅政府殊不足以代表暹羅人民。那國會實在只能代表暹羅少數資產階級，至於農民，工人和商人這輩老百姓，在政府裏面的發言機，可說是絕無僅有的。</p>
<p>記者在曼谷短期勾留中，曾在報端見到有關政府機關舞弊的記載。在配給布疋和其他行政方面都有舞弊情事。記者又從富地僑胞和美僑那裏得悉暹羅政府官員　賂公　，許多高官顯宦都發了財。政府機關裏的低級人員大都公然向民間收受「茶　」和「　　」。</p>
<p>貪　領導下的現內閣，懦弱無能，不能解決種種問題，大概有改組的可能。據曼谷方面的報導，曾經以親善使節的資格來我國訪問的暹羅元老乃比里，或將出面組閣。記者曾往訪乃比里，作簡單談話。當記者問到他的政治方針時，他回答說：他是否將重返政治生涯，還沒有決定。但乃比里確是暹羅政界的一位幹材，　貪　所領導的現內閣，僅僅執行幕後人的命令。</p>
<p>同時又有謠傳，說在日本佔領期間當溫國務院長的披汶，也許東山再起，重返政治舞台。披汶現居曼谷近郊，雖曾做過日本的傀儡，在政府中仍佔有很大的政治勢力。暹羅的反華運動就是披汶所策動的，一旦他重行執政，暹羅的僑胞將再度遭受苦難。多數消息靈通的政治觀察家說披汶暫時不致返任。可是他在不入的將來，總有一天要回來做暹羅的獨裁者，到那時我國在暹羅的經濟利益和僑胞將有難以為繼之概。（完）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>中國工商界之呼聲</h3>
<p>上海工商界重要人士昨日繼各大學校長之後，聯名致電美國當局，說明中國目前可痛之現象乃戰後世界普往徧病象之一環，中國人民與政府，除應自行繼續努力以求取改革與進步而外，仍深信並希望美國必能本其同情與友誼，援助中國。署名於這個電文的，都是上海乃至全國工商金融社團的代表人物，故此簡短的電報，不啻卽為中國工商界自由份子之呼聲。</p>
<p>工商界代表之呼聲，與日前上海各大學校長之呼聲同樣重要，因至少可以表示三點：</p>
<p>（一）這些足以代表中國正當工商業的人士，與教育家相同，並不如魏德邁特使離華聲　中所說「已充滿墮落之失敗主義」，也非採取「一種漠不關心之態度」，却正相反的極想等候調查團的訪問意見，而惜未得其機會，以致魏特使離華聲明中連「上海」這個大都市的地名亦未一加提及。</p>
<p>（二）他們這一羣工商業自由份子，對於「中國今日極可痛心之情况，不欲粉飾，」且極願努力以求取改革與進步，但對於蔣主席卓越之領導仍具强固的信心，而對於戰後中國慘遭共匪之破壞與叛亂，則深惡痛絕。在中國正將跨入民主政治的時代，這些工商業的自由份子和他們的職業社團的態度確是值得重視的。</p>
<p>（三）他們雖沒有像各大學校長一樣，認為八年抗戰與戰後二年困於兵　乃局勢轉劣之原因，但他們確切指陳「戰後世界普徧失調之景象」，以及「中國問題當視為戰後世界普徧病象這一部份」，則當非美國一部分報紙所說「中國人慣於諉過於人」之空談。</p>
<p>自二次世界大戰以來，人們早就相信戰爭與和平均為不可分割者。當一九三七年日本侵略中國時，羅斯福總統雖在芝加哥發表其隔離防疫的驚人演說，但亞洲歐洲的戰火畢竟燒到了美國人的頭上！中國今日之局勢，我們中國人自然應自負其重大的責任，但恐亦無人能否認此為世界普徧病象中的局部表現。所謂世界普徧病象者，質言之，卽一切久戰疲憊的國家，人民生活普徧艱困，而到處又遭逢共產主義的極權政制與自由主義的民主政制間之思想衝突，——此衝突或不幸而卽可為第三次世界大戰之亂源。中國乃尤不幸而適處於此衝突之尖端而已！故中國之局勢，決不能視為單獨的中國問題。</p>
<p>惟是中國人民，——尤其社會上的自由份子，一方面固當提醒美國及其他友邦，糾正其隔岸觀火的態度，或隔靴搔癢的觀點：但另一方面，仍應加倍反省，加速團結，加緊努力，俾能充分發揮其力量，督促政府實踐其肅清貪汚與加强行政效率的改革。中國新興的工商業者雖方在萌芽，而其為民主憲政的骨幹，應與西洋民主國家的歷史演進並無二致。他們既發出了呼聲，應當不自菲薄，作更進一步之努力。</p>
<p>我們相信美國必不放棄中國。我們更相信美國必能於中國自由主義的教育家或工商業者奮起而促成政治與經濟的革新時，放手援助中國，以恢復中國之和平安定與繁榮。</p>

<h3>杜魯門向巴西國會宣稱　美決支持聯合國　美巴兩國友誼益形密切</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：杜魯門總統今向巴西國會聯席會議致詞，對聯合國表示信心，略稱：「美洲共同防禦條約已為自由人民之國際合作，樹立一榜樣。目前各國距離和平尚遠，其任務之艱苦，遠甚於我人所逆料。各國必須加緊合作，爭取共同目標，即道德與公理。世界各地動亂示巳，我人之國家在戰爭中雖亦有甚大之犧牲，但已免遭巨大毀損。巴西與美國必須不負人　，為萬萬人之自由而奮鬥。對於適告閉幕之泛美會議，美國人民寄以極大之期望。此次所成立之協定，使全世界均蒙其益。巴西京城將成為歷史上之名城，促進各國諒解并建立法律與秩序。若干方面對於聯合國之成就表示失望，但我人決不能放棄努力，因聯合國乃我人所最需要者也。我人必須牢記一點，即聯合國之任務，并非解決由戰爭直接引起之問題，但可在公平解決獲得後，從事維持國際和平。在簽訂憲章後，聯合國并未充分生長成，我人應以耐心，達到目標。聯合國絕非暫時之機構，實乃維護世界人民福利及和平之樞紐。在初期所遭遇之困難，不應使吾人沮喪。相反的，美國決心以所有資源支持聯合國。美國與巴西頗多相同之點，兩國對於基本人權，均具信心。兩國思想雷同，友誼與日俱進。」</p>
<p>〔路透社里約熱內盧四日電〕白宮隨行人員發言人稱：渠未聞杜魯門總統擬自里約逕行飛返華盛頓，總統最近之計劃，乃為其專機將在特里尼達等候，大約總統將自巴京乘「密蘇里」號主力艦赴特里尼達，然後換乘飛機返美。「密蘇里」號將以每小時三十哩之速率開駛。</p>
<h3>馬卿范登堡讚揚　泛美洲會議成就　加拿大不參加和平宣言</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日自巴西京城回國，發表廣播稱，「美洲各國互助聯防條約，足以證明各國如誠意促進世界和平及人類幸福，無不可如願以償」。馬氏並涉及對蘇談判之持久及困難情形稱，「吾人兩年來締造歐洲和平之舉，亦可無阻撓的稽延，無紛擾的宣傳而吿完成。」參院外委會主席范登堡廣播稱，「美洲各國互助聯防條約，實爲黑暗世界之陽光。吾人之所作所爲，不與任何人爲敵，如有人懷疑吾人另有目的，彼等不帝在自道心跡。此十九國公約毫無妨害任何一國對聯合國之責任，吾人之行動絕不存有征服或帝國主義之雜念，僅係對國際眞理及安全之努力」。渠最後稱，渠將以此約提交參院待其批准。</p>

<p>馬歇爾國務卿現已開始與其高級專家加緊協商，以期得於兩星期內渠出席下屆聯合國全體大會之前，得以成立肯定之制度。此項制度係以美國認爲歐局日趨惡化，至年底將無從控制之觀點爲根據。關係方面預料美國通過臨時緊急援歐計劃之假定時間表，約如下述：（一）衆參兩院外交委員會不久即開始聆取關於此事之意見，使國會主要份子得以熟悉歐洲危機之情形；（二）兩院於十一月初召開全體特別會議，以批准馬歇爾計劃實現前臨時緊急援歐費用三十億元；（三）臨時援助計劃開始實行以後，即立刻進行完成馬歇爾援歐計劃之立法手續，務使歐洲復興計劃於渡過冬季危險期後，得以即時展開。傳杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務鄉今已同意爲使歐洲經濟不致全面崩潰起見，當需要美風供給不下一百億元之援助。副國務卿洛維特三日初次透露之臨時緊急援歐計劃，其成功與否胥視國會之態度而定，而國會之態度，又大部份須視馬歇爾國務卿，在今後數日內與參議院范登堡及國會首要人物之協商結果而定。</p>

<h3>省市劃界　奉令解決　七寶東部大場全區歸滬市　貼補仍照十七年成案執行</h3>

<p>（乙）補貼：應依照民國十七年本部與省市三方議定成案，自本年一月份起繼續執行，其加成數由省市雙方自行商訂，嗣後視物價漲落，酌予調整，並按月撥付，並繪具界圖。</p>

<h3>白璐一語成讖　希望成泡影·永別了人間　家屬決向法院起訴　但求判明肇事責任</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕白璐墮梯慘死一案，地檢處檢察官方正昨晨親蒞國際飯店勘査。午後三時白璐家屬及影劇界人士，在金谷飯店招待新聞界，說明數點；（一）死者家屬此次決向法院提出控訴，其目的在判明是非及肇事責任。（二）死者於出事前身體極爲正常，外傳其墮梯主因爲精神恍惚，全非事實。（三）將來提出民訴後賠款完全用於本市劇人福利基金。嗣由風子報告白璐生前為人，渠謂決以多年老同學身分，為死者向社會呼寃。繼由崑崙影片公司廠長夏雲瑚等追述當日出事經過稱：白璐淸晨自國際飯店外出，往王人美家中取物，返國際時曾有丁聽同行。出事時電梯外層鐵門確未關閉，白璐因匆匆歸來，未及審視，即跨步踏入，不料竟造成巨禍。當時電梯司機在二三層樓間曾聞慘呌一聲，足證鐵門並非白璐自行拉開，實係機鈕失靈。此後渠等曾往國際實地試騐多次，且白璐入殮之日，國際在該電梯旁掛有修理木牌，無論以常識或價理判斷，國際當局對其職務上之疏忽，均難辭責任云。</p>
<p>又據崑崙公司談：白璐此次來滬另一任務，爲應該公司之邀拍一「希望在人間」新片，不料片名竟成讖語，希望成爲泡影，從此永別人間。</p>

<h3>志願兵登記未多　籌增安家補助費　團管區司令部邀各區區長會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市團管區司令陳天僑，昨晨邀請各區區長在該司令部商討志願兵徵集問題，民政處軍事科姚科長被邀列席。師管區司令傅正模蒞會致詞，各區長就各該區目前志願兵登記情形分別報吿，約有三點：（一）志願兵登記不踴躍。（二）願登記爲志願兵者，多無保人。（三）一般認爲四百萬元之安家補助費過少。姚科長繼報告兩點：（一）已報名之志願兵，可先送新兵征集所，膳食由市政府函兵役協會統籌辦理。（二）市政府已令各區組織出征壯丁慰勞委員會，加籌安家補助費，以謀補救。嗣經討論結果，決定：（一）各區分別召集保甲長開會，加强役政工作，並商討增籌安家補助費辦法，積極進行。（二）屆期志願兵額不足，決依法抽籤征集，俟與吳市長商談後決定。在此期間，函請兵役協會加速免緩役審査工作，俾於必要時，便於進行抽籤征集。</p>
<p>又昨日報載本市志願兵已於昨日開始征集說，民政處軍事科姚科長聲明不確。據謂擬於十五日開始征集之文稿，已呈市長批閱，是否如期開始征集，目前尙不能決定。姚氏指出志願兵安家補助費，尙未開始征收，實爲征集集期延終之原因。又報傳志願兵登記改在民政處統一辦理，亦非事實。</p>
<h3>黨部方主任委員　對出征軍人致訓</h3>
<p>市黨部方主委，昨晨對江灣出征軍人致訓，略謂：「古人說「兵兇戰危」，可見用兵是不得已的事，我們經過八年苦戰，好容易才把日本人趕走，共匪即乘機搗亂，阻撓復員建設工作的進行，破壞國家的統一和平，不許人民安居樂業。試看共匪所到之處，殺人放火，奸淫擄掠，無所不爲，弄得人民呌苦連天，共匪一天不消滅，國家就一天不能復員建設，人民一天不能安居樂業。爲要救國家，救民族，救同胞，必須澈底肅淸共匪，因此，國家在抗戰勝利之後，不得不再忍痛用兵，以消弭亂源，完成建設」。方氏訓話後，復巡視各營舍，垂詢一切。</p>
<h3>余案第四庭　未亡人携孤到案　含淚請歸還金條</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍軍事法庭昨晨九時開庭，續詢謀殺余盛孝案證人。苜傳發達洋服店老板吳根惠及該店夥計柯善清，兩人稱出事之日午後三時，余盛孝携金條五根至店，謂却利向其購買金條，當時即有友人忠吿須十分小心。却利至後，余盛孝即隨之而去。吳根惠並描寫却利爲一肥胖之人，嘴邊有八字鬚，雙目露兇相。綱傳余盛孝之妻陸氏。陸携幼孩入庭，謂出事之前一天，丈夫回家稱，却利將以美鈔債付黄金價款，晚上即將金條五根帶返，曾以秤稱過。次日晨九時外出後，即一去不返。並稱：七月三十一日晚上，夫曾吿彼此項交易之對手，爲一高級軍官，而朱提却利之名。余陸氏又含淚稱：夫死之後全家無以爲生，請求法庭助其維持全家生活，並取回金條。此時帕勒謨上校即答稱：此事在軍事法庭範圍之外，不但無權允許，且亦無權作此建議，甚盼受害人能向主管機關請求。</p>
<p>孤兒三口一無積蓄</p>
<p>余陸氏出庭時，淚痕滿面，甚爲悲戚，謂有孤兒三人，而死者一無積蓄，今後生活堪虞。法庭繼傳詢海格路紅十字會醫院孫姓職員，謂八月一日余盛孝送抵醫院時，身受三創，已吿死亡。繼將其受傷情形，略作解釋。隨又請法院法醫汪世之與法官檢察官被吿辯護人等硏究當時騐屍時所攝之照片。汪法醫頻謂當時太忙，故對死者之受傷部位等，已不復記憶。如法庭需正式之騐屍照片，可自檔案中提出。至是法庭即傳審美海軍水手屈倫貝爾。屈曾於八月一日晚間在新麗殊酒吧間目睹馬萊，據稱：是日在酒吧中確見馬萊及其一友人同在，並聞馬萊詢問一根金條能折合多少美金等語。</p>
<p>最後傳訊美軍醫官</p>
<p>最後傳審美軍醫官許少校。許爲華僑，英語流利，當在庭上對騐屍經過，作詳盡之報吿，並謂凡此均詳載於記事本上，已作成正式報吿送呈美軍總部。此時被吿辯護人起立質詢，謂於人死十四日之後，作表面之騐屍，不作解剖，其結論是否可靠？許少校當答稱：人之胸部經兩槍射擊之後，生存之機會已甚少，余盛孝之死因爲槍擊已無疑義，現値得硏究者爲屍體上彈孔之方向。據本人之意見，槍彈乃自前方射入，而自背後穿出者。至是法官紛紛提出間題，對余盛孝之致死原因作種種推敲，但除槍擊之外，並無任何新發現。至四時四十分，主審官宣布退庭，定今晨九時重開。</p>

<h3>鹽城風雨</h3>
<p>〔本報東台二日訊〕蘇北自收復後一年來，一直在一片陰霾的籠罩中。在這一塊肥沃的平原上，共匪始終不曾放鬆一步地在流竄，在製造鬥爭，屠殺，爲了擴大他們的叛亂而搜刮本錢。一般在陰霾籠罩下的人們，都似乎有一種預感——蘇北免不了降臨一陣暴風雨！</p>
<p>八月一日，匪軍在小海（蘇中根據地之一。距東台六十華里）開了一次「高幹會議』。出席的有：蘇中軍分區司令員管文蔚，及僞興化，皇寗，建陽，射陽，合北，東台，紫石，　潼，鹽東等九縣縣長。會議在午後開幕，五時閉幕，三小時的時間，決定了「進攻鹽城」的議案。</p>
<p>參與這一役戰事的匪軍，計包括第十一，十二兩個縱隊，約十四個團，另附山砲連兩個通，携有山砲八門，再加其他地方性的散匪，共約三萬餘人。由管文蔚任指揮官，曹荻秋（匪十一縱隊司令員）任副指揮官，一蘇中軍分區特務團團長」胥金城任後動主委。限令各僞縣政府在八月五日以前征集担架隊五千名，並指定引水溝（距鹽城五十餘華里）爲後動集中地點。</p>
<p>八月五日夜間，戰事序幕揭開。匪分向</p>
<p>鹽城外圍各據點：南洋岸，上岡，伍佑，岡門，新興塲展開攻勢。時駐防鹽城的部隊是×××集團軍的第×師，由於城防的重要，無法增援，各該地的自衛武力，在衆寡擺殊之下，壯烈赴難。迄六日午後止，外圍各據點，先後吿陷。</p>
<p>戰火一步步地向鹽城進逼。鹽城形成了楚歌四面的危局，緊張萬分。全城各界組成了堅强的指揮機構，發動搶修</p>
<p>巷戰工事籌辦慰勞　救濟等事宜。</p>
<p>熱血與生存慾，激動了每個人的正義心和責任感。全城民衆將僅有的食物，香烟和日用品，向每一位備戰的士兵和出力者慰勞。江蘇省銀行，中農行和國庫的鹽城辦事處，臨時撥出了一億五千萬元，作勞軍之需。</p>
<p>這一個惡運，終於降臨到鹽城。十日深夜，四郊送渦來幾下砲聲，似乎吿訴人們，匪軍已聞始他的「攻城戰」。</p>
<p>當時的城防，西門由民衆自衛隊及整編×××師的四個排防守，其餘三門，則由第×××集團軍所部佈防，士氣均甚激昂。</p>
<p>十一日，匪軍利用土幹，猛攻竟日，衝鋒達十四次，卒未得逞。可是孤城困守，外援盡絕。十三日拂曉，守軍疲憊，匪乘機由</p>
<p>南門突入大肆屠殺，各機關公務人員，及一部民衆，隨部隊退守北城之省立鹽城中學的工事內，作最後之抵抗，企圖挽回危局。然而覆巢之下，豈有完卵？該據點旋於十二時爲匪擊破，各機關首長及主要人員，當塲自殺成仁的，頗不乏人。</p>
<p>匪入城以後即開始搶掠工作，全城物資，搜刧一空。公務人員及無辜民衆之被害者，當在千人以上，被俘者約萬餘人，則分別被押解到大中集，南洋岸等匪軍基地，備受苦厄。（政府人員被害而已證實者，有黨部書記長王旡遁被擊斃，靑年團主任劉劍秋溺死河中）。</p>
<p>城在赤色恐怖的　漫中度過九天。廿一日，即吿收復。國軍這一個突擊的行動，使匪軍的預定工作、並不曾能完全實現。（據匪軍的估計，國軍的援軍，兩星期內不能到達。）據廢城人告訴我：假使國軍再遲一雨天到達的話，則鹽城縱使收復，也已變成一片瓦礫了。（匪軍的計劃，在國軍到達時，不抵抗撤退，但要縱火洩憤。）</p>
<p>目前臨城一切，均尙未上軌道，但秩序却很安定。東台鹽城間的小輪已於上月二十九日復航。東，鹽間的公路，在軍民</p>
<p>合作搶修之下，一旬之內，也可通車，然而鹽城已是一座空城，（物資給匪搶光了）。僅剩下少數婦孺老弱（少壯的給匪捉走了），他們翹望的是政府能予以大量的救濟。</p>

<h3>耕者有其田　中農行在蕪湖舉辦土地貸欵</h3>
<p>月息四分每以廿五畝爲限</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖二日訊〕「耕者有其田」的土地政策業已經由中國農民銀行在米區蕪湖開始試辦。本年四月，中農行土地金融處派了魯良鉞主任戴宏鏘等二人，首先在蕪湖開拓全皖這一新事業。每年對地主納租的佃農們聽到說中農行貸款給他們去買地主的田，人人都當作笑話。等到魯良鉞等下鄕眞的做出幾十件這種爲佃農買田貸款的實例以後，鄕下人對於如今的政府能爲最苦的人做事精神，才表出了相驚訝。</p>
<p>四個月來，在蕪湖的獨鳳鄕與瑞南鄉，共有曹志旺，陳大江，袁允生等七十六戶佃農，得到中農行的買地貸款，買得了田地，他們付的借了四百萬元，有的借了二百萬元，他們買田數目，一個佃農最多不能趨過他的耕種能力，目前一家佃戶以甘五畝爲限。這種土地貸款，月息只四分。二年半以內，分五次還淸本息。七十六家成為自耕農的老農，都在今年收穫時還淸了貸款的大半，因爲每畝田上作租穀的，稻十賣出的款子就可抵償買田的貸款項下的半數了。（他們大都以二十萬元一畝的價錢買到田，此刻作租的稻子每畝約値十萬元以上。）</p>
<p>中農行的計劃，在一年以內要貸放十億元土地貸款給佃農買地。跟着爲農民買地的業務之後，中農行尙與農業推廣所合作，要推廣所把優良稻種首先在買田的佃農農田上推廣，以求農產物改良，生產增加，中農行蕪湖分行陳仁傑舒嘯兩經理希望把蕪湖做出一點成績，再向安徽其他各區推廣。</p>
<p>這是民生主義的土地政策的一點萌芽。民卅一年中農行首先在四川北路開辦這一決策，成果甚佳，各省均由中農行選地開辦，以期達到土地金融業務所持的「拼者有其田」，「地盡其利，人盡其力」目標。（特派員康風）</p>

<h3>市府期召集私校負責人　解决浮收學費問題　學生學業保障會已由市府嚴令取締</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長爲本市私校收費標準事，特於昨晨在市府接見記者稱：私校收費標準，與市校敎員進修費，業經四日參議會教育小組通過，其目的有二：（一）减輕家長負担，使淸寒學生有讀書機曾；（二）提高敎師待遇，俾安定敎師生活。如省學店作風，任意超收學費者，決予嚴厲取締。辦理完善經　公開之學校，政府當予以保障。淸寒獎學金，市府正繼續勸募中，業經各方認捐者已達五十一億元，審核辦法正與各校接洽，並由市政府，參議會，敎育局，中小學敎職員聯誼會推派代表一人，共同組織審核委員會。凡學校未經敎育局核准而超收學費者，嚴予取締，迄目前爲止，並無一校呈准。若干學校在收費標準尙未決定之前、已發收費通知，且未能按照標準辦理者，市府已定於本月八日（星斯一）下午，召集各私立中小學負責人談話，務使各校浮收學費，即行退還。最後吳市長重申近來有所謂「學生學業保障委員會」，未經政府機關核准，發表公告，并有銷售助學章情事，七種假公濟私之行爲，殊屬不當，已令飭警察局從嚴取締，並正迫究主持者，希市民協助政府，話時揭發檢舉。</p>

<h3>胡適向蔣主席建議　十年敎育計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報專訪〕北大校長胡適博士，參加南京中硏院院士選舉籌委會，上月底帶病冒暑南來，那時在國際飯店的一個角落上，對記者們問他關於魏德邁到北平和他談話的內容，一槪回絕，他說就是我的太太，也不能吿訴她，你的……。</p>
<p>博士明天一早就要乘空中覇王號回北平去了；昨天他纔從南京到上海來，下榻國際飯店十三樓。自晨至暮，客人不斷的拜訪，使他疲於應付，在電話小姐的回聲裏，他約記者「晚一點」去看他。</p>
<p>入晚，記者應約前往。胡適博士穿着絲睡衣，正安詳地坐在沙發上看晚報，劈頭一句，博士微笑着：「沒有可談的」。</p>
<p>在不談「魏德邁」的條件下，我們還是談下去。</p>
<p>博士從這次出席中硏院院士選舉籌委會談起，他說：下月十五日舉行第一次評議會，決定候選人名單，並予公吿，明春舉行第一一次評議會，選舉八十到一百位院士，以後由院士本身每年選舉十五位，十年後國家就有二百多院士。博士認爲這是國家的大事。</p>
<p>正在南京舉行的遠東基敎會議，博士沒有參加，他說我們是個文明國家，而文盲最多，基本敎育包括義務敎育和職業敎育，現在我們和外國專家集會討論，藉以促進自己的努力，實在是必要的，他希望政府招待各國專家在遊覽京滬杭之後，也招待他們到北平去看看。</p>
<p>從一樓樓的輕烟，他吐出：王安石是個最不爲「爲己」的學人，但他主張學者第一件事就是爲己，是充分的發展自己，爲己有餘而後爲人，國家倒楣到今天的地步，決不是喊口號，貼標語，罷課，可以渡過難關的。今日國家缺乏科學，缺乏工業，敎育落後，靑年要能責己，且須努力發展自己。易卜生說：「年靑朋友最要者，能把自己鑄造成器，」無論是科學家，哲人，或者詩人，總得把父母自然給你的這塊材料，造成一個「器」。三十年前，我這樣說，現在還是這樣說。</p>
<p>說到這裏，他吿訴記者：這次在南京向蔣主席提供了一個十年敎育的建議：在今後十年中，先五年，政府集中精力，以大批款項發展已經有了基礎的五個大學，後五年再發展其他五個大學，使之成爲國際上第一流的大學。先五年的五個大學，是北大，淸華，浙大，中央，武大；後五年的五個大學，他說，現在還看不出來，就看各校的努力程度了假如國立大學不努力，在學術上沒有成就，很可能是幾個敎會大學取而代之。博士認爲與其每年花費犬宗外匯，送州學生出國留學，不如把這些錢，來發展國內的大學。日本維新後，集中精力，充實「東京」「京都」兩個大學的成績，是個絕好的先例。</p>
<p>現在學校多，力量分散，絕辦不出成績來。至此，博士作了一個預言，應該是一個警吿：不久以後，中國將有成千萬的學生到日本去留學，那是極可恥呵！</p>
<p>蔣主席可接受您的建議？博士笑了笑，我就吿辭了。（其容）</p>
<h3>星島第四戰　敗於伊思明　二比三：星島表演進步</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕港星島足球隊四日在羅姆福與伊思明聯隊交鋒，以二比三敗北，上半時告終時，雙方各進一球。星島射門技術，大有進步，在全局比賽中，球當爲星島所操縱，伊思明聯隊內有國際選手六人，踢來完全正宗派作風，星島隊個人表演，以鄒文治最爲傑出，盤球及傳球，使對方難於應付，中衛許竟成，宛如一座鐵塔，使對方中鋒無用武之地。守門余耀德，仍繼續有精彩表演。開賽十分鐘後，鄒文治首中一球，未幾伊隊耿氏還敬一球，上半時各一平手，下半時耿氏及史丹那又中兩球，至終塲前十五分鐘，鄒文治又進一球，以三比一一終。中國大使鄭天錫，羅姆福市長卓別林，及英國足球會秘書長魯斯，均蒞塲觀戰。</p>

<h3>全國紗聯理監事會議決　會員紗廠退出工協　棉紡業國大立委名額太少　推派三代表晉京要求增加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國紗廠聯合會第廿于三次理監事聯席會議，於昨日下午五時，假中國紡建公司會議室舉行，到杜鏞，唐星海，吳昆生，石鳳翔，榮爾仁，章劍　，束雲章，吳味經等，討論迄七時許散會。茲探誌要案如次：</p>
<p>（一）此次政俯分配國大及立委名額，全國紡織業，國大僅得四名，立委僅得二名。面紡織業中單以棉紡一業而言，其在工業界地位之重要，對國家民生貢獻之大，實應增加名額，決定推派吳味經劉丕基在竹一三人代表於下週一晋京，分向行政院針會組織等部請願要求，單就全國棉紡業而言，國大名額增至四名，立委名額增至二名。（二）進口工業原料，目前已全由工業協會主持分配，惟査紡織業範圍龐大，故紡織業所需之工業原料，應自行支配。（三）全國紗廠聯合會應即通知所屬會員，退出工業協會，以維全國紗廠聯合會之獨立性。（四）全國經委會頃正召開小組會，討論紗布調節方案，決推吳味經，劉靖基，榮爾仁，石鳳翔四人，自動晋京參加討論。</p>

<p>紗市續挫</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開即以鄂豫地方不靖一，運漢之紗，均遭退回，又因紡建公司開紗，議價續低，市氣一蹶不扳。迨至收時，散戶見低略吸，價稍回上。結果四二支藍鳳紗比上日步跌二十萬，爲一千七百三十萬元。廿支特雙馬小三十萬，輕雙馬軋小卅五萬，十六支光明低十萬，其他各紗亦續降三十萬元不一。</p>

<h3>談崑曲</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>我曾武斷地說過這樣的話：「硏究藝術而不懂一些崑曲，總是一個缺點。尤其硏究中國文學的，如果沒有讀過曲，我以爲他就不配談中國文學，講習音樂，舞蹈，戲劇的；如果沒有參觀過崑曲的演出，實在就是他最大的損失。』</p>
<p>我所以自認爲「武斷」，因爲我只那樣籠統地說出我的結論，並沒有詳細地說出我的理由。也許不但「武斷」，還有些矛盾，因爲我是素來提倡新文學，而反對舊文學的，曲爲舊文學，何以我又那樣地推重呢？</p>
<p>不過我到底不敢武斷也不敢矛盾，我可以說出我的理由。</p>
<p>先說中國文學。歷來的傳統觀念，只認散文，駢文，詩，詞是文學，小說和戲曲不在內。尤其迂闊的，簡直將四書五經都當作文學，而小說和戲曲更絕對在排斥之列。自從王國維諸人對曲另眼看待之後，許多正統派的學者，才對曲有一些了解，與以一些珍里。原來，第一，曲在中國文學史上的地位是重要的。一代有一代的文學特色，曲爲元代文學的特色，也爲明淸文學的主要配角，中國文學史上不注意牠，或者注意了牠而不能與以適當的述評，道部文學史就是不完全的。第二，曲在中國文學上更佔着重要的地位。，可以借王國維論元曲的話來證明。他說：『元曲之佳處何在？一言以蔽之，曰，自然而已矣！古今之大文學，無不以自然勝，而莫若於元曲。』又說：「其文章之妙，亦一言以蔽之，曰，有意境而已矣！何以謂之有意境？曰：寫情則沁人心脾，寫景則在人耳目，述事則如其口出，是也。古詩詞之佳者，無不如是，元曲亦然。」第三，曲在中國現代文學或說新文學上，更有重要的關係或影響，我們可以從牠看出中國文學演變的迹象，而推知現代新文學的出現，爲必然的結果，而使一般抱殘守缺，嗜古有癖的人，少發些反對的廢話。也可以使我們知道，現代新文學應走的路逕乃是大衆化，其最後的目的乃是使大衆又藝化，因爲曲正是大衆化而又要使大衆文藝化的。王國維說：「古代文學之形容事物也，率用古語，其用俗語者絕無；又所用之字數亦不甚多；獨元曲以許用襯字故，故輒以許多俗語，或以自然之之聲音形容之。此自古文學上所未有也。」這就是曲與大衆的說明。</p>
<p>因此我說，沒有讀過曲的就不配談中國文學，也許可以免於武斷之議了吧了而曲尤其與現代新文學的精神相合，我的推重牠，也許不見得就與我的提倡新文學相矛盾吧！原來我的反對舊文學，也只反對那些傳統的舊文學，而有新精神，更與現代新文學不謀而合的舊文學，如與焉。只因這種可以稱之爲新的舊文學，爲數很少，大多數都是古香古色，裝腔作勢，無一是處的舊文學，所以我往往要槪括地排斥一下，何况曲素來爲正統派的文人浙不起，本不在正統文學之內，我的反對舊文學，也不過反對正統文學而已，曲本來不在內。我的話旣不敢武斷，也不敢矛盾，就是爲了這些理由，跳然我感覺到還是說得沒有詳細。</p>
<p>次談音樂等各種藝術。戰前稱爲「綜合的藝術」，實在很恰當，不必多所解釋。而曲之所以爲曲，最要的也不於牠的演出，曲不妨就稱爲戲劇，而將淸唱的曲，算作詩歌。此外，古代的詩歌，也都兼帶表情與舞蹈等動作，本來就與戲劇同源。因此也許可以說，戲與曲，本來是一物搬上臺去演，是戲劇，放在案須讀，是曲。而戲曲便成爲一個混合的合理的名稱。元曲便是元劇，明淸的傳奇現是曲亦是劇，那就沒有問題了；元明淸戲曲是中國疑問呢？</p>
<p>元曲的唱演，大都已失傳。明淸傳奇的唱演，自從明朝崑山魏良輔首創「水磨調」之後，風靡一時，天下翕然宗之，一直到現在，「崑曲」二字，就成了中國戲曲的代表名稱，尤指其唱演而言。因此崑曲就是中國的「綜合的藝術」，也決非過言。你不信麼？那你不妨去看看，或者親去聽聽。</p>
<p>不過你要是懷着成見，以爲那只是胡鬧，去觀聽崑曲，那當然是格格不入的；即使你沒有成見，而對於一般藝術並沒有多少了解，你去觀聽了，也將一無所得；最後，如果你是有藝術修養的，而不能將崑曲的藝術，和你所了解的藝術相印證，我說，你的所得，也將無幾。照我這個對藝術並無什麼修養，對崑曲也只一知半解的人看來，先說崑曲的唱，實在有牠的獨到處。</p>
<p>崑曲的唱是融合着聲韻學，和聲學，作曲法這些學理而成的。牠的高下疾徐，剛剛適合着我們東方人，尤其中國人，發抒各種情感的需要。崑曲雖然衰微了，皮黃與各種地方戲却盛行，而牠們的唱法，就大都是從崑曲中脫化而出的，不過删繁就簡，去難就易罷了。我總不願意說，中國的音樂，尤其唱，比了西洋的，便一無是處。如果還有其應有的價値與地位的，那就不能不推尊那集大成的本體崑曲來，</p>
<p>音樂中的伴唱樂器，中國的鑼鼓絲竹，無論如何，總將永垂不滅。而這些樂器的吹奏，不論你在何時何地所聽見的最好的調子或配合，也都保留在崑曲裏。</p>
<p>藝術中的舞蹈，在戲劇上也佔了重要的地位，因爲牠可以代表唱演者的動作。唱演者的動作，就以最近流行的話劇說，也決不是我們日常的隨便動作，牠總要帶一些節奏，合乎音樂的旋律，有類於舞蹈，這是大家都知道的。歌劇那就非有舞蹈不可了。我說，中國固有的各種舞蹈，也都保留在崑曲裏，皮黃戲的一舉手，一投足，往往會博得觀衆的大聲喝采，又誰知「崑曲戲」（這是不能成立的名稱，通俗乃對皮黃戲而言），「音」身段，一字一表情，自始至終都是舞蹈呢！一人唱是單人舞，兩人唱是雙人舞，對舞，多人唱是羣舞，集體舞。用舞蹈的眼光去看崑曲的動作，乃爲得之。甚至最爲人所不了解或反對的打武，說穿了也只是一種舞蹈，崑曲們打武雖不及皮黃的火爆，緊張，而牠的優美，精雅。却是無可否認的。</p>
<p>舞蹈時，尤其打武和羣舞時，所取的種種位置，也正是藝術中很好的圖案。由圖案而及繪畫，那末，唱演者的各種打扮和裝飾，憑着他們數百年來的經騐，去蕪存菁地逐漸改良，到了今日，也不能不說牠已到了爐火純靑的地步。諸你不要看輕臉譜，以爲這只是野蠻人文身的遺留，實在牠也是一種高貴的藝術。凡此一就各種蠢劇而論，都是崑曲發其端，到現在，也還是保留在崑曲裏的最優美，最精雅，合乎閏的條件。</p>
<p>戲劇中的種種，合乎藝術中的種種，例如姿勢合乎雕塑等，也就不必談了，換言之，崑曲中的種種，合乎藝術中的種種，也就不必多所詞費了。</p>
<p>硏究藝術，講習音樂，舞蹈等等，原應該從現代的入手，而其最後的目的，也應該創造新的。但新的總不能無根而生，尤不能全部抄自西洋，舊的，尤其這崑曲一項，可以對新的作許多貢獻，我以爲什麼不肯略加一顧呢？這不是最大的損失是什麼？略加一顧，這可以多所欣賞，爲人生增加高尙的，正當的娛樂，似乎我們也沒有無一視崑曲的理由吧。</p>
<p>因此，我從硏究或講習種種藝術，放棄了崑曲唱演的機會，就是最大的損失，不是武斷吧，而我也是極力提倡新藝術的，現在只主張這種舊藝術，崑曲的唱演，有保存，參考和欣賞的必要，也不見得是矛盾吧！</p>
<p>那末，崑曲在今日，不論案頭的曲，舞台上的唱演，我們都可以作如是觀：保存之，參考之，以及欣賞之，因爲牠自有牠不可漠視的價値在！只要我們不中牠在思想上所遺留下來的毒，傳統的封建意識和迷信等等，就好！</p>
<p>（附誌：九月十三日十四日，在蘭心大戲院將有兩塲崑曲票友的大會串，目的是爲東吳大學勸募助學金，愛好崑曲或欲一觀「崑曲戲」之究竟者，似不妨以之作爲本文參證。）</p>
<h3>湖濱之夜</h3>
<p>— 培茵</p>
<p>唁夜，沒有月亮，沒有星星</p>
<p>我跨出家門，走過小巷，來到大街上。再穿過有彩色霓紅燈的街道，我到了淸靜的湖濱。湖濱的公園裏顯得昏暗，浮蕩着一些神秘的空氣。</p>
<p>我安祥地漫步着，循着湖濱的小徑。</p>
<p>沿湖安置着的有靠背的綠漆木椅上，倚偎地坐着一對對的情人，有的來遲了，就坐在那些鬆軟的草地上，他們以低柔而多情的聲調談說着，種種親密的態度顯露出他們相互間的熱情。</p>
<p>讓黑暗遮掩了他們的羞慚，黑暗使他們變得大胆。……</p>
<p>暗夜的湖濱是情人們的樂園。</p>
<h3>馬柳泉賣子歏</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>馬柳泉賣子嘆云：「貧家有子貧亦嬌，骨肉恩重那能拋？饑寒生死不相保，割腸賣兒爲奴曹。此時一別何時見？遍撫兒身舐兒面，有命豐年來贖兒，無命九泉抱長怨。囑兒切莫憂爺娘，憂思成病誰汝將？抱頭頓足哭聲絕，悲風颯颯天茫茫」。此作大類老杜口氣。</p>
<h3>文人愛貓</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>——紫羅蘭盒雜碎</p>
<p>貓是一種最馴良的家畜，也是家庭中一種絕妙的點綴品，舊時間中人引爲良伴，不單是用以捕鼠而已。吾家原有一頭玳瑁貓，已畜有三年之久，善捕鼠，並不偸食，便溺也有定處，所以一家上下都愛它。不料最近却變了，整天懶得動彈，常在　上打盹，見了東西就偸去吃，便溺也不再認定一處，並且常把脚爪亂抓地毯和椅墊，使我非常痛恨，但也無可奈何。不料前天早上，却發見它死在園子裏了，也不知通它是怎麽死的。幸而它已生下了兩頭小貓，總算沒有絕嗣，差無後顧之憂。我們送掉了一頭，留下了一頭，毛片火黃夾着深黑色，腹部和四脚都作白色，比母親生得更美麗，也可算得是移人尤物了。</p>
<p>吾國文人墨客，大都愛貓，因此詩詞中常有詠歎之作；淸代詞人錢葆馚倚雪獅兒調詠貓，遍徵詞友和韻，名家如朱竹垞，吳榖人，厲樊榭等都有和作，朱氏三闋，雅韻欲流，可稱貍奴知己。其一云：「吳鹽幾兩，聘取貍奴，浴蠶時候。錦帶無痕，搦絮堆綿生就。詩人黃九，也不惜買魚穿柳。偏愛住戎葵石畔，牡丹花後。午夢初迴晴畫。歛雙睛乍豎，困眠還又。驚超藤墩，子母相持良久。鸚哥來否？惹幾度春閨停繡。重簾逗。便請爐邊又手。」其二云：『勝酥入雪，誰向人前，不仁呼汝？永日重階，恒把子來潛教。癡兒騃女。且莫漫綵絲牽住。一任却食魚捕雀，顧蜂窺鼠。百尺紅牆能度。問檀即謝媛，春眠何處？金縷鞋邊，慣是雙瞳偏注。玉人迴步。須聽取殷勤分付。空房幕，但銜蟬休誤。』其三云：「磨牙澤吻，似虎分形，眼黃須辨。炎景方長，試騐鼻端冷暖。　香業暗。撲不住螻蛄一點。更尋向籬根紫芥、石稜紅莧。醉了葧荷頻顫。訝搔頭過耳，永痕初浣。消息郞歸，休把玉鞭敲斷。平陵傳徧。問　鎖金錢誰綰？風吹轉。峽蝶驚飛凌亂。』</p>
<p>不但吾國文人愛貓，就是西方文壇名流，也有好多人都有貓癖的；如法國文豪器俄，（V.Hugo）要是不見他的愛貓在房間裏時，心中就會鬱鬱不樂，若有所失。小說家柯貝，（F.Coppee）更如痴如醉的愛着貓，連年搜羅名種，不遺餘力，有幾頭波斯種的，名貴非常。小說家高梯爾，（T.Gautier）也豢養着好多頭的貓，無一不愛，都給它們題了東方式的名兒，如茶比德，左培瑪等；有一頭雌貓，用埃及女王克麗巴德蘭的名兒稱呼它；另有一頭最美的，生着紅鼻藍眼，平日最爲鍾愛，不論到那裏去，總帶着同行，他稱之爲西菲爾太太，原來西菲爾是他自己的名兒，簡直當它像愛妻般看待咧。英國文壇上，也有幾位愛貓的名流，如小說家兼詩人史谷德，（W.Scott）本來是愛狗成癖而並不愛貓的，到了晚年，却來了個轉變，對於貓引起極大的好感，他曾在文章中寫着：『我在年齡上最大的進步，就是發見我愛着一頭貓，這畜生本來是我所憎惡的。』詩人考伯（Cowper）每在家裏時，他所愛的一頭小貓總是厮守在他的身旁，他曾寫信給朋友說：「這是蒙着貓皮的一頭最靈敏的畜生。」其他如約翰生（O..Johoson）白朗（O.M.Brown）華爾泊（H.Walpole）諸名作家，也都是有名的愛貓者，平日間與貓爲友，非貓不歡的。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「你這呌『明知故問』；……你這孩子，……唉！」耀羣嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>「您不是現成有許多外國藥粉嗎？使用起來，又便當，又不傷人……要這玩意幹嗎？」</p>
<p>「這玩意不是很經久嗎？」耀羣的面容立即罩上一層傷感的神色，有如褪了顏色的花瓣。</p>
<p>「不，紀姨……！」小老虎把一雙晶亮的大眼睛睜得圓圓地，摹倣着成人的態度，預備同耀羣爭辯似的：「經久？這玩意只要使在手上身上，我記得邱爺說過，只要使上一回，不只改變顏色，還要生一輩火疔泡兒——毒得厲害！……」</p>
<p>耀羣忽然掉下了幾滴眼淚。</p>
<p>邱爺是寨子裏老一輩的人物，有一肚子的三敎九流，還有一肚子的離奇見聞。閒撩天的時候，他說過一位千金小姐逃難的故事；這小姐長得跟月裏嫦娥一般，因恐長毛注意，她用「毛草根」煎水洗澡，把自己的花容王貌毀了，遍體雪白皮膚，經這毒草一洗，變成焦黃，浮腫，還長年不斷地生着火疔泡。耀　爲了好奇，記住了這個草名，還恐邱爺是打哈哈說着玩，又背地去追問，邱爺拿出本草綱目來證實他的故事。小老虎買藥回來，想是也記起了這個故事。</p>
<p>耀羣何必要化裝？她有新式化裝技能，何犯作用這毒草？旣打定主意這麼辦，又何必如此傷心掉下眼淚來？</p>
<p>耀羣自己說過，幹間諜要靠化裝，那是表示自己沒有能耐；除非犯了兩個條件：一，要冒名頂替一個人，鑽到這人的交游圈子裏去，探取秘密。二，自己的面目已被某種社會團體認識，同時也知道他的職務和目標，然因某種關係又不得不親身參加這個社會或團體探取秘密，除了化裝，並無別法可達目的；這才需要改變面目</p>
<p>然而這時耀羣的工作，似乎並不在這兩個條件之內。那麼，她又何必化裝，甚至毀容？</p>
<h3>美國在餵養「日本老虎」</h3>
<p>— David　Conde著　正明譯</p>
<p>編者按：麥帥在「勝利日」演說，對日本現狀備致稱崇；幷且說，對日和約，應取寬大政策，但日本至今尙保存着畢國主義的靈魂，麥帥的看法，對中國，對世界，實爲一大隱憂。</p>
<p>這篇文章，對於麥帥現行政策，作了一個嚴峻的批評，也許可以作爲當前「對日和約」的一件參考文獻吧。</p>
<p>美國已經改變原先對日政策，現在應該已是對大家都淸楚的事情了。在東京觀察家們於一九四六年四月內就看到此種向後轉情形已經發生，但此種逆轉，對於亞洲和平究有若何意義，直到現在才變得淸楚起來了。</p>
<p>在量初幾個月內，指導着佔領軍那個原先政策，或許已是羅斯福新政以强硬政策對付一個戰敗侵略者的那個觀念，在太平洋上最後一個證據了。一九四五年九月的美國國務院，作戰部和海軍部的聯合指導部，曾經計劃過要始終鏟除這個威脅其各鄰邦和全世界的日本的。</p>
<p>非得鏟除了日本的武裝力量，剝奪掉了軍閥和侵略擁護者們的當權地位，結束了由獨佔巨頭們所操縱的扼制手段使他們不能再度成爲發動戰爭的經濟和工業發條，而且允許日本人民有政治自由，藉使他們能够建立一個他們自已選擇的政府，始能完成上述目的。</p>
<p>任何一個有主權的國家，均有在任何時候改變其政策的權利，任何最高統帥所有只要他認爲必需即可催促改變此種政策的權利的。</p>
<p>如果誘說或鼓勵人民或各國來相信美國原先的對日政策已經實行的話，那末這不僅是一個大錯，而且也是對生活在太平洋盆地內全體人民充滿着危險的事情。</p>
<p>日本仍是亞洲最強大的工業强國，日本的經濟幷未民主化，而且日本人民也幷未能完成有效率的政治民主，可以運用任何值得重視的控制力量，以駕馭日本龐大的製造戰爭的潛力。</p>
<p>飛機場和軍事設施依然點綴在日本的鄕郊內，工事和障碍物仍未拆毀，甚至連那工事和防禦物建立其上的平地，也幷未改闢成爲大爲需要的農地哩。</p>
<p>戰時用來當作隱蔽壕的工廠和軍事司令部的地下洞穴，從九州到北海逍仍可看到，這在一個已經實行新民主憲法幷已永遠誓絕戰爭的大地內看來極不相稱。</p>
<p>除了那個龐大的復員局以外，日本的海，陸，空，軍雖已復員，而且全部軍事武器幾已盡被銷毀，但是日本依然保特着可以造成一座偉大戰爭機器的每一種必需要素。所缺的只是原料而已。</p>
<p>「反共稜堡」</p>
<p>麥克阿瑟將軍旣已將亞洲「反共稜堡」的角色給予日本担任，那末原料問題也就不會長久成爲問題的了。一個「稜堡」，如欲使之具有任何價値，那就必須在經濟上和軍事上都能堅强起來，一定要給予貸款和技術援助，才能使它扮一個最重要角色。必須保證日本有做生意的地區，賺錢來抵付進口和供養它的人口。如果以前的各處殖民地不能歸回的話，那末必須保證它能有原料可得。</p>
<p>賠償物品雖一面從日本搬出去，但她仍能保持鋼製，化學和造船工業，而且日本仍保有一個熟練的勞働力。</p>
<p>最近，有人問麥克阿瑟，在佔領軍撤退以後，日本如何始能「保護」她自己。他回答說：「一個方法是開倒車允許他們有一個小的軍事設施」，雖然他覺得美國應代爲堂管這個任務。</p>
<p>如果日本是一個民主國家，如果日本人民能對他們自己的命運，具有某種可以重視爲控制力量，而且如果現在已有某種證據，可以担保日本領袖們決不利用日本的鎖鑰地位，在三大主要强國：—中國，美國和蘇聯—間從中取利，玩弄强權政治以夷制夷的熟悉方法，再度表現主宰亞洲，那末這樣的一種政策才能說是有意思的。</p>
<p>然而這種保證幷沒有啊</p>
<p>重複歷史上的錯誤</p>
<p>麥克阿瑟將軍無疑的覺得他有許多正當理由可以用來說明他所以改變對日本的態度，他已將從一個使日本完全解除黷武主義而在經濟上完全實行民主化的政策，改變成爲一個將日本造成一座「反共稜堡」，幷帮助她實行經濟復興的政策了。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰以後，對德國所犯的那種同樣的錯誤，現在豈非又對日本在幹出來了嗎？許多有思想的觀察家們，無不認爲美國幹的正是這種蠢事。（譯自密勒氏評論報）</p>
<h3>東京來郵所感</h3>
<p>好像是奇遇。我今天收到東京寄來一張名信片，是一位日本朋友寄給我的。我凝視遺張明信片，發生了以下的觀感，轉吿「自由談」的讀者：</p>
<p>（一）現在對日利約未締結，中日交通未恢復，據說日本能直接寄信來中國，乘美國的船或飛機，中國却不能直接與日通郵，自然官方例外。</p>
<p>（二）明信片所貼郵花共五十錢，除十五錢印在片上外，寄信人貼有一張十五錢的郵花，兩張十錢的郵花。這張十五錢的郵花，印着麥克阿瑟元帥的像，可見日本人尊麥帥爲「聖帥」，一點也不錯；兩張十錢郵花，赫然印着「大日本帝國郵便」字樣，這說明了日本的「民主化」，麥帥的「精神革命」，完全是虛偽的。</p>
<p>（三）這張明信片書寫中國爲「支那」，足徵日本文化人士對中國的觀念，仍是「支那觀念」，其他的人所抱的觀念，可想而知了。</p>
<p>本來這是一件小事情，可是我們能眞實的，認識今天的日本。</p>
<h3>節約</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>節約聲聲到滬濱，</p>
<p>歌壇舞榭苦吟呻；</p>
<p>不因提平移淫侈，</p>
<p>却敎豪門作則身！</p>
<p>報載節約消費辦法實施綱要第七條「娛樂塲所限夜間十一時收塲」。本市限三日起實行，但本市戲館無塲，在夜間十一時，正是上座鼎盛之時，今命令提早打烊，一般歌壇舞榭之老闆，莫不「呻吟歎苦」，其實在時間上受了「限費」，却不能在物質上眞的受到節約，更何能「移轉淫侈之風？」但回顧豪門，「驕奢淫佚，」更不知千百倍於一民間的消費」，故要「實行節約」，還不如先從「豪門以身作則」，倒實惠得多了。</p>
<h3>愛缺陷</h3>
<p>— 朱梅</p>
<p>在巴黎的羅佛宮內藏有羅丹。在我們什麼都愛大團圓的中國人的眼光看來，這眞是一個缺陷。好好地一個美女，爲什麽讓她缺少一隻手。我們儘管什麼都愛圓滿，但命運却注定人類不能有圓滿。我們常常看見某一個家庭有一個好的妻子，而丈夫却不好，有一個好脾氣的丈夫，而太太則凶得要死。父親是成功立業的偉人，兒子則常是一個敗家子。窮人本來曾是富人，眼前的富人也就是未來的窮人。有人不愛看悲劇，因爲悲劇是人生的缺陷，但悲劇永遠不終斷地出演。瑪格麗想與她的情人同生共死，但結果爲了另一種愛把自己犧牲，使他自己在一種缺陷中而死。缺陷的確是一種使人傷心的事。比如一個人穿一件漂亮而潔白的西裝，有人却在他的衣上滴上一滴油，那油漬便是一種說不盡的缺陷。人便生活在缺陷中。人要活下去，就要習慣於缺陷。月不能永遠圓的。在黑暗中才知道光明的美麗。沒有黑暗，怎麼知道光明的可貴呢？人如果安於缺陷，則缺陷便繼成圓滿了。不傷心的人不知道快樂的滋味。一切都是不能，也不會長久的。阿里山的「神木」（註）雖然活了三千年，但是我敢斷定它不能永久活下去的。三千年的時間雖然够長，但時間更比它長，它免不了還得同時間而消滅。我們應當愛缺陷，愛一切，以世界上的物與事沒有不可愛的。（三六，八，廿五，於靑島）</p>
<p>（註）台灣阿里山上有一條樹，日人稱之爲神木，圓徑三十二米，已活三千年為世界第二最年老之樹。</p>

<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽</p>
<p>美國的私立軍事學校</p>
<p>美國僅是一百多年的新興國家，以年資論，是我們第三千代的灰孫子，可是他們的敎育，工業，經濟，一切都在我們之上，連戰國以來打了毛二千年內戰的軍事學術，也要向這後生小子請敎了。這不是我們落伍，實在是他們進步得太快。有一位光榮抗戰的讀者想到美國去受軍事敎育、但如何選擇學校，毫無着手之處，我覺得這是値得公開商討的。美國的軍事敎育有正式與非正式兩種，正式的如WestpointVirginia　Military　Academy,　Staff　School以及軍部所屬各兵科專門學校。這種學校戰前除「西點」外，不收外國學生，而「西點」亦祗收中國政府所派之學生，每期以二名爲限，王賡即爲「西點」之老牌學生，聞溫應星亦爲西點畢業。前期　　畢業例派送美國受軍　訓練。但格於西點每期二名之規定，均入其他私立軍事學校　業，現我國之留美軍事前輩均以私立軍事學校出身者爲多，西點係科班正途，則誠鳳毛麟角矣。私立軍事學校，係中學程度，以造就後備軍官爲目的，各地均有，數以千計，人學並非一定限制，當地報紙登廣吿公開招生，學宿等費較普通中學爲昂，而入學者以富家子弟爲多。軍裝一襲之費恒在美金百元左右，而各該校學生，大抵軍服燦爛（有金綫也）刀光閃閃（指揮刀也）英武非凡，尚有英國禁衛軍之遺風。就學時期，學生均有官階，自小兵以至上校，而在名片上亦赫赫印有官階，故途中遇十四五歲之上校，大可不必驚異，且絕非冒充軍人，顧畢業後進正式軍事學校受訓，其階級仍為小兵，但訓練期滿即升任正式軍官，即使畢業考試未通過仍保有後備軍官資格。美國各大學均設有軍事學院Departnent　of　Military　Scienes，課程着重於軍事技術方面，如測繪製圖，軍事通信，間謀反間諜，外國語文騎術之類，敎官以現役或後備高級軍官爲多，有上校，少將，中將，担任訓練工作者。若干大學所設軍事學科之航空科，有自備飛機及飛機塲、其範圍之大，堪與任何軍事飛行學校相比，此等大學中之航空科，爲造就民用航空人才之大本營，亦即補充軍事航空人才之源泉，故一且發生對外戰爭，政府可不費大力，而數百萬已訓練完成之精兵可以立致。美國之兵有一特點，即富有書卷氣，蓋多數出身於大學之門，休戰解甲，均能在社會上獲得較優位置，其因停戰而失業，而吿地狀者，踏破鐵鞋無覓處也。（四）（九）</p>

<h3>My Delegation to the UN General Assembly: Foreign Minister Wang and Others to Fly to America Today; Discussions on the Japanese Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang and his party arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 2:45 PM yesterday. They are scheduled to depart at 6:30 AM this morning on a Pan American Airlines flight to America, with a planned stopover in Honolulu before flying to San Francisco. They will rest for one or two days before proceeding to New York. Mr. Feng Jinbai and Mr. Zhou Qianchong have already departed by ship to America yesterday. According to informed sources speaking to reporters, although the UN General Assembly session will last as long as two months, Foreign Minister Wang, due to his duties at the ministry, will return home within a month. One or two of the accompanying personnel may remain in the United States to handle all matters. During this trip to America, Foreign Minister Wang may confer with leaders of relevant countries on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. Based on the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission in June of this year, there are no significant differences in viewpoints among the countries regarding the strictness of the peace treaty. Therefore, the problem may not lie in the peace treaty itself, but in its implementation. However, after the peace treaty is established, the executor will not be the United States alone, but a regulatory body established by various countries to supervise its implementation. Furthermore, the question of whether to raise the issue of Dalian at the United Nations General Assembly has not yet been considered by us. Because the situation in Dalian is already clear to the world, and there is a lack of solutions to the problem. Raising it at the General Assembly at this time would not help in practice and may delay the speed of resolving the problem. However, everything will depend on the actual situation, and it is not yet possible to say for sure whether to raise it.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Issues Statement; Supports Reasonable Interpretation of the Veto Power</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang issued the following statement yesterday:</p>
<p>One of the important issues to be discussed at this session of the United Nations General Assembly is the veto power. A proposal to amend the United Nations Charter related to this issue has been included in the provisional agenda of the meeting. Our government believes that the solution to such an important issue lies in establishing a generally reasonable interpretation of the veto power as stipulated in the Charter and reaching an agreement among all parties, rather than amending the Charter itself. Moreover, amending the Charter is unlikely to be realized at present. Since the establishment of the United Nations, it has not yet had a sufficient opportunity to be tested. I believe this opportunity should be given to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese government has doubts about the possibility of amending the Charter at present, it is fully prepared to respect the majority opinion of the General Assembly regarding the reasonable interpretation of the veto power in the Charter in order to restrict its use. When the San Francisco Conference adopted the United Nations Charter in 1945, the four major powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China jointly issued an interpretation of this matter when necessary. The Chinese government also intends to support proposals to change this interpretation.</p>
<p>As for the issue of convening a peace conference with Japan, it is clearly not within the scope of the General Assembly's authority. However, I am still willing to take advantage of my presence in New York to exchange views on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty with the leaders of all countries directly related to the peace treaty with Japan. In July of this year, the Chinese government, in response to the United States' proposal to convene a preliminary conference on Japan, stated that the Chinese government is willing to make some concessions regarding the veto power applied in that conference, if other countries can agree. However, China has clearly stated that if the Soviet government refuses to participate in the conference proposed by the United States, China will reconsider its position on this matter.</p>
<p>Now some people are talking about a separate peace treaty. China believes that we should not lightly abandon the cooperation of some countries and separately propose a peace treaty with Japan. The purpose of our efforts should be to conclude a treaty that benefits all the Allied countries and is jointly supported by all the Allied countries. Because only such a treaty can enable us to fully enjoy the benefits of peace. Needless to say, no country should unreasonably obstruct the realization of this goal. Regarding the organization and procedures of the agency responsible for drafting the Japanese peace treaty, I think it may be based on the organization and procedures of the Far Eastern Commission. In this Far Eastern Commission, all eleven countries that directly fought against Japan, not just China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, have representatives participating. At the same time, the four major powers of Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union each retain the veto power over the resolutions within the meeting. This method, or other similar methods, should be applicable to the preparatory meeting for drafting the Japanese peace treaty to break the current stalemate on this matter. The veto power system applied to the German peace treaty in the Foreign Ministers' Conference is indeed debatable, but we should not ignore the fact that the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland were established under the same system. In addition, in accordance with the procedures described above, the Far Eastern Commission also reached a unanimous resolution on the basic policies of the Allied countries toward Japan. Winning peace is certainly a difficult task. We should all be prepared to work hard for this difficult task. The efforts made for this should not be less than the efforts made to defeat the enemy in a hundred battles, or even more.</p>
<h3>British Parliamentary Delegation to Visit China; Arriving in Nanjing on October 6th</h3>
<p>We will treat them with state guest honors</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] It is learned that the British parliamentary delegation to visit China is scheduled to depart for China at the end of September, with a planned stay of four weeks. Our government will treat them with state guest honors. The approximate itinerary in China is as follows: They are expected to arrive in Hong Kong on October 3rd, and in Nanjing on the 6th. After a brief stay in Nanjing, they will fly to various locations including Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Qingdao, Shenyang, and Taiwan on the 11th for sightseeing. They will return to Nanjing on November 1st, stay for two days, and then return to the United Kingdom via Guangzhou and Hong Kong on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>A Rain in Kuling Signals Autumn; Tourists Plan to Return</h3>
<p>Gu Zhengding and Zheng Yanfen Return to Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Kuling, 5th] After a heavy rain last night, the weather here suddenly turned cold. The room temperature this morning was seventy-two degrees, indicating the arrival of autumn. Tourists on the mountain are planning to return, with more than 300 people scheduled to descend the mountain within the week. The Chairman and his wife did not go out for sightseeing on the 5th. Mrs. Chiang hosted a banquet at the official residence at 6:00 PM, inviting Mr. An Wen, the Western adviser to the Mountain Administration Bureau, and five people from Shanxi Province to accompany them.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Kuling, 5th] Gu Zhengding and Zheng Yanfen left Kuling by plane at 10:00 AM on the 5th after being summoned to see the Chairman again.</p>
<h3>Handling Overseas Deposits</h3>
<p>Will Proceed Through Diplomatic Channels</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the use of overseas deposits of Chinese citizens, the Control Yuan had previously decided to send supervisors such as Yang Nairu to the Ministry of Finance to thoroughly investigate the implementation of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. However, since the "Draft Regulations on the Declaration and Registration of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China" was passed by the Entire Economic Commission, this matter seems to no longer require thorough investigation. Whether overseas assets of Chinese citizens can be handled now depends solely on whether foreign countries will provide us with assistance. It is heard that the authorities will soon pursue diplomatic channels again to negotiate with relevant countries.</p>
<h3>The "Policy Guidelines for the 37th Year" Proposal; The Executive Yuan Will Not Discuss It</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] The policy guidelines for the government in the 37th year, drafted by the Central Design Bureau, were submitted to the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting for discussion on the 5th. However, the political commissioners pointed out that the current period is a transitional one, and it is not appropriate to establish the policy guidelines for the government under constitutional rule. The proposal was rejected.</p>
<h3>Assembly and Resident Committee Request the Government to Send Control Committee Members to Supervise Elections; Minister of Interior Emphasizes Reforming Local Politics</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] After Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng reported on internal affairs measures at the Assembly and Resident Committee meeting on the 5th, assembly members Xue Mingjian, Wu Chunwu, and others raised questions about the current handling of election affairs, focusing on election fraud and local political issues, especially regarding cleaning up local politics and reorganizing local governments before the general election. In his response, Zhang emphasized his determination to reform local governments and said that he had previously suggested to the authorities that some provincial governors be transferred in order to achieve the goal of reforming politics. At the same time, he expressed his determination to punish fraud and eliminate corruption. As for election affairs, he will ensure that they can be completed on schedule. If there are any cases of local officials covering up wrongdoing, they will be punished after being discovered. Regarding the implementation of elections in the pacification zones, Zhang said that he will submit a detailed report on the pacification zones to the National Government for instructions before the 15th of this month to facilitate the handling. Subsequently, a proposal on election supervision by Yin Shuxian and others was passed. The proposal is as follows: It is proposed that the government specially dispatch Control Yuan committee members to various constituencies to supervise election affairs in order to establish a good foundation for constitutional government. It was decided to send it to the government for prompt action.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Resident Committee of the Political Assembly held its fourth meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM on the 5th. After Secretary-General Shao Lizhi read a written report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Zhang of the Interior gave a report on internal affairs and answered questions. Subsequently, the assembly members raised many questions and suggestions, to which Mr. Zhang responded truthfully. Then, the discussion of proposals proceeded, and the written report submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was passed.</p>
<h3>Assembly and Resident Committee Decide to Establish a Research Association on Policy Towards Japan</h3>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] In order to study the issue of Japan, the Resident Committee of the Political Assembly decided to establish a Research Association on Policy Towards Japan. The candidates for participation have now been confirmed by the assembly members and total twenty-one. Their names are as follows: Wang Qijiang, Chen Shaoxian, Gan Jiaxin, Lin Zhong, Xue Mingjian, Zheng Kuiyi, Lu Qian, Yu Bin, Yin Shuxian, Jin Weixi, Wang Baoxuan, Cai Zhisheng, Wang Junying, Zhang Qianhua, Wu Chunwu, Pan Chaoying, Zhao Shu, Fang Shaoyun, Zhou Qianchong, Wang Huayi, and Wu Xu.</p>
<h3>Important Figures from Shanghai's Business and Industrial Circles Jointly Send a Telegram to the American Authorities, Explaining China's Situation Amidst World Turmoil; Willing to Continue Promoting Cooperation Based on Sympathy and Friendship</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City] Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, important figures from Shanghai's business and industrial circles, including Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jilou, held a meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to discuss the situation between China and the United States after the departure of the Wedemeyer Mission. As a result, it was decided to jointly send a telegram to the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and congressional leaders immediately, expressing important opinions. The full text of the telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>The people of our country express their deep gratitude to your government for sending the Wedemeyer Fact-Finding Mission to China. What we regret is that during Special Envoy Wedemeyer's stay in China, we did not have the opportunity to present our opinions in person. We hereby represent the major industrial and commercial sectors of our country and respectfully present our views for your consideration.</p>
<p>We do not wish to gloss over the deeply regrettable situation in our country today. However, we believe that the situation in our country should be viewed from the perspective of the widespread post-war global disorder. Consider the United Kingdom, with its strict discipline and its territory never ravaged by the enemy during the war. What is its situation today? What about the situations in France, Italy, Greece, and other Eastern European countries? Even take the countries of South America as an example. Your President and Secretary of State just attended the Pan-American Conference and declared its success. These countries have not suffered from war and even had large surpluses of US dollars two years ago. What is their situation today?</p>
<p>Our country has been at war with Japan for more than four years before the Pearl Harbor incident. Two years ago today, when the World War ended, we were also tragically subjected to the destruction and rebellion of the Chinese Communists. Due to these various factors, it would be surprising if the situation were not as serious as it is today.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, with his outstanding leadership, has led China to victory in the difficult war of resistance against Japan. The people and government of our country will certainly continue to make unremitting efforts under his leadership to seek reform and progress. However, we believe that the China problem cannot be viewed in isolation and should be seen as part of the widespread post-war global illness. Making demands for perfection in an ivory tower may not be helpful in any way. Your country has always expressed broad sympathy for our country and its difficulties. We firmly believe and hope that your country will continue to maintain its friendly and supportive attitude.</p>

<h3>Five Municipal Councils Again Jointly Send a Telegram to the Central Government, Requesting an Increase in the Number of National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Qingdao Municipal Councils and the Shenyang Provisional Municipal Council had previously jointly suggested to the Executive and Legislative Yuans that "each district in the directly administered municipalities should elect one National Assembly representative, and one female representative should be allocated for every ten representatives." This proposal has not yet been approved. Therefore, yesterday, these five municipal councils again jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang and Vice-Chairman Sun, requesting that it be submitted to the State Council for adoption immediately. They also sent a separate telegram to the other seven directly administered municipalities of Peiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Dalian, Harbin, and Chongqing, seeking a unified position. The original text of their telegram to Chairman Chiang and Vice-Chairman Sun first cited four reasons, including population density and the effectiveness of National Assembly representatives exercising political power, to argue that "directly administered municipalities cannot be regarded as equal to counties and cities." It then stated, "Although the Constitution does not explicitly stipulate how to calculate the number of National Assembly representatives for directly administered municipalities, according to traditional customs, the 'district' of a directly administered municipality can be interpreted as an equivalent area to a county. The population of each district-level unit in our country's directly administered municipalities, such as Nanjing and Qingdao, averages around 100,000 people, which exceeds that of a county in the inland provinces. Shanghai, on the other hand, mostly has around 200,000 people. In fact, the population of thousands of counties across the country is below 200,000 people. Therefore, the 'district' of a directly administered municipality should be interpreted as an equivalent area to the 'county or city and its equivalent area' in Article 26, paragraph 1 of the Constitution. Having each district elect one National Assembly representative would be in accordance with the correct interpretation of the Constitution. The conference has unanimously advocated that in directly administered municipalities, each district should elect one National Assembly representative, and one female representative should be allocated for every ten representatives, requesting the Executive and Legislative Yuans to adopt it, but unfortunately, it has not yet been approved. Therefore, we are listing the gains and losses again and jointly requesting your approval. Please submit it to the State Council for adoption, and amend the current National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law and the table of allocation of seats, etc., to confirm that the 'district' of a directly administered municipality is an equivalent area to the 'county or city' in Article 26, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, and each district elects one National Assembly representative, in order to conform to the correct interpretation of the Constitution and satisfy the hopes of the citizens. We hope to receive your instructions promptly."</p>
<h3>Iliness Undermines Xinjiang Peace; Zhang Zhizhong Sternly Questions, Sends Letters to Ahmetjan Qasimi and Rahimjan Sabirhajiev</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 5th, Urgent Telegram] Since Deputy Chairman Ahmetjan Qasimi and Deputy Director Rahimjan Sabirhajiev left without resigning last month, the situation in Xinjiang has become increasingly serious. It is learned that General Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwestern Headquarters, sent letters to Ah and Lai, first stating that he had been faithfully implementing the central government's established policy of giving the people of Xinjiang peace, democracy, freedom, and all rights to which they are entitled since the signing of the Peace Agreement. However, the Iliness side not only showed no sincerity in implementing the Peace Agreement, but also created many tragedies and disputes. Recently, they even instigated opposition to Masud as Chairman. They also launched riots in the three counties of Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun, and pointed out the fact that they have no concept of the motherland, developing their so-called "East Turkestan" movement and instigating opposition to Han Chinese with the help of the Soviets. He then put forward five principles for future cooperation: (1) Thoroughly implement the Peace Agreement and both sides should honestly review the past rights and wrongs. (2) Promote the construction of the New Three Principles of the People based on the spirit of "guaranteeing peace in the province, upholding national unity, implementing democratic politics, and strengthening ethnic unity" as stipulated in the provincial committee's words and the provincial administration's platform. (3) Abandon factional control, achieve special political intentions, support democratic leadership, and promote the realization of democratic politics. (4) Abandon political struggles and actively carry out economic, educational, and cultural construction to meet the wishes of the people of Xinjiang. (5) Uphold national unity and promote Sino-Soviet friendship. Finally, he raised serious questions to the Iliness side: (1) Is the complete withdrawal of the Iliness members a unilateral tearing up of the Peace Agreement, declaring it invalid? (2) If the Iliness side unilaterally tears up the Peace Agreement, are they preparing for another armed rebellion, undermining peace, and are they willing to bear the responsibility for violating their oath of office to "guarantee peace in the province" and "be subject to the punishment of heaven and national law"? (3) If there is no intention of either of the above, are they willing to return to Dihua to discuss openly and seek reasonable and legal solutions to "all problems"? The full text is more than 4,000 words, with stern words and righteous meaning, but still reveals tolerance and magnanimity throughout. It is reported that this letter was sent out the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Newspapers, Magazines, etc.</h3>
<p>Regulations Stipulate Automatic Reduction in Size</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] The regulations on saving paper for newspapers, magazines, and books, which were passed and promulgated by the Executive Yuan on the 5th, are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1. Local newspapers should strive to save space in the layout of news and advertisements. Those that were originally more than one sheet should automatically reduce to one sheet after the promulgation of these regulations. Those that were originally more than two sheets should not exceed two sheets.</p>
<p>Article 2. The size of local magazines should comply with the following regulations: 1. Weeklies should be limited to sixteen pages per issue. 2. Bi-monthly magazines should be limited to thirty-two pages per issue. 3. Monthly magazines and above should be limited to sixty-four pages per issue. The number of pages mentioned above is calculated on one side. The cover may be four pages extra.</p>
<p>Article 3. Newspapers, magazines, and books should use domestic paper as much as possible.</p>
<p>Article 4. The Ministry of Interior may, based on actual needs, moderately adjust the number of newspapers and magazines in various places to achieve a balanced cultural development while saving resources.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] In the regulations on saving paper for newspapers, it is stipulated that local newspapers can automatically reduce their size. Someone asked Secretary-General Gan that if this regulation is not enforced, how can it be implemented immediately? Gan replied, hoping that it can be done automatically.</p>
<h3>Commercial Dance Halls Completely Banned Within a Month</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] The regulations banning commercial dance halls were discussed for a long time at the political affairs meeting on the 5th. Some committee members believed that there are differences between Eastern and Western customs regarding the act of "dancing." In Europe and the United States, soldiers returning from the battlefield must first dance all night long, preferring to enjoy themselves today and die in battle tomorrow. However, it is not the same in our country. The general public's perception is quite different. Especially the atmosphere in commercial dance halls is not good. Therefore, after heated discussions, it was decided to completely ban them within one month before the end of September.</p>
<h3>Japanese Textile Industry Included in Reparation Materials; We Strenuously Argue to the Far Eastern Commission</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the suggestion that the Japanese textile industry must be included in reparation materials, our government has telegraphed Ambassador Gu Weijun to the United States, formally submitting it to the Far Eastern Commission and arguing for it strenuously.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet, Sino-Burmese, Sino-Korean Border Survey Teams</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Depart from Nanjing in Early October</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] In order to carefully survey our country's defense borders, the Ministry of Interior has joined the Ministries of National Defense and Foreign Affairs to form a survey team, scheduled to depart in early October to survey the undetermined areas of the Sino-Soviet, Sino-Burmese, and Sino-Korean borders, to serve as a reference for establishing permanent borders.</p>
<h3>Japan Lacks Both Raw Materials and Capital; No Large Output of Goods for Export; Opening Trade is Actually Equivalent to Barter</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Responsible officials said that opening trade with Japan is not as serious as outside concerns. The Japanese side also does not have a large number of goods for overseas export. The situation is as follows: (1) This time, the Allied Headquarters only allowed foreign merchants to go to Japan and did not allow Japanese merchants to go abroad to promote goods. Japanese merchants cannot operate in the markets of other countries. (2) Japan is currently short of both raw materials and capital, and its production capacity has decreased. There are no large quantities of goods available for export, let alone dumping. Moreover, the prices of Japanese goods are strictly controlled by the Allied Headquarters, making it difficult to compete with other countries. (3) The Japanese goods that can be purchased with cash are only seafood, bamboo lacquerware, and other consumables. All machinery and important hardware materials must be exchanged for raw materials imported into Japan. Opening trade in name is actually equivalent to barter. (4) Judging from the difficult situation of barter trade between our country and Japan and the difficulty of exchanging materials in Japan over the past year, the development of Sino-Japanese trade is not very optimistic. According to the considerable barter funds that our country still owes to Japan last year, although it has not been settled this year, the amount must increase. It is not easy to purchase. Trade is different from reparations. It must first send the materials it needs and then be able to exchange them for the materials that we are allowed to import back home.</p>
<h3>National Austerity and Thrift to Remedy Lack of Foreign Exchange; The Executive Yuan Promulgates Five Measures Yesterday</h3>

An organizational regulation for the Austerity and Supervision Committee specially established by the Executive Yuan for the implementation of austerity was also announced. Gan declared on the spot that our government is currently short of both materials and foreign exchange. To remedy the lack of materials, we can find ways to increase production, while to remedy the lack of foreign exchange, we can only practice austerity and thrift. These measures are divided into two parts: governmental and public. In addition to the measures announced today, the rest, such as the reduction of personnel and goods in government agencies and the ban on dancing, are implemented by order. Gan emphasized his hope to cooperate and advocate with the press to reform social customs and complete the mission of saving on consumption. It is also learned that some of the measures for saving on consumption in government agencies are based on a percentage reduction of existing consumption. After these measures are formulated, each agency must report to the Executive Yuan by the 10th of this month, and then the review and decision will be made. Secondly, regarding the issue of staff reductions in government agencies, it is scheduled to be reported to the Executive Yuan before the 30th of this month, and the decision will be made after review.</p>

Afterwards, an announcement was issued, stating in essence: All representatives deeply feel that the prospects for realizing "political democratization and nationalization of the military" in the past Three-Party Common Governance Program are remote.

In the afternoon, the seventh session was held, chaired by Xia Taosheng, to discuss economic and financial proposals. It was generally believed that it is difficult to implement a free economy under the current circumstances, and that a controlled economy is prone to corruption. Therefore, it was generally advocated that the government should adopt a planned economy policy. As for the division of state-owned and private enterprises, efforts should be made to encourage private enterprises, except for certain important enterprises that must be operated by the state, to avoid competing with the people for profits. The Congress is scheduled to discuss party affairs today. If the discussion can be completed today, it will close after electing the Central Executive Committee. Furthermore, the list of candidates for general election in the Youth Party will be determined by the future Central Standing Committee, and will not be discussed at the Congress.</p>

<h3>Today's Siam (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>– By Our Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>Reflecting each other with new, modern buildings are the Royal Palace and many old temples. The exterior of the Royal Palace and most of the temples are all silver and gold, dazzling in the reflection of the sun. When the reporter visited the Royal Palace, he saw many completely Chinese-style furniture and decorations. The form of the throne is like a sailing ship setting sail, perhaps indicating the first generation of Siamese. The Laotian-style White Marble National Assembly Building is an interesting contrast to the Royal Palace. This marble National Assembly Building is another architectural marvel in Bangkok, especially to show the progress and democratic spirit of Siam.</p>
<p>Siam's superficial modernity may be a characteristic of the Siamese government. The Siamese government, like the capital Bangkok, has all the external symbols to indicate a progressive spirit. In reality, however, despite the new constitution, the Siamese government is not enough to represent the Siamese people. The National Assembly really can only represent a small number of the Siamese bourgeoisie. As for the farmers, workers and merchants, the common people, their voice in the government is extremely rare.</p>
<p>During the reporter's short stay in Bangkok, he saw reports in the newspapers about corruption in government agencies. There were corrupt acts in the allocation of cloth and other administrative aspects. The reporter also learned from fellow overseas Chinese in Phuket and American expatriates that Siamese government officials were taking bribes for public purposes, and many high-ranking officials had become wealthy. Low-ranking personnel in government agencies openly accepted "tea money" and "tips" from the public.</p>
<p>The current cabinet under the leadership of "Thamrong," which is corrupt and incompetent, cannot solve various problems and may be reorganized. According to reports from Bangkok, Prince Nai Biri, a Siamese elder who once visited our country as a goodwill envoy, may come forward to form a cabinet. The reporter visited Nai Biri and had a brief conversation. When the reporter asked about his political policy, he replied that he had not yet decided whether he would return to political life. However, Nai Biri is indeed a capable person in Siamese politics. The current cabinet led by "Thamrong" only executes the orders of the people behind the scenes.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were rumors that Phibun, who was the Prime Minister during the Japanese occupation, may rise again and return to the political stage. Phibun currently lives in the suburbs of Bangkok. Although he was once a Japanese puppet, he still holds great political power in the government. The anti-Chinese movement in Siam was planned by Phibun. Once he returns to power, the overseas Chinese in Siam will suffer again. Most well-informed political observers say that Phibun will not return to office for the time being. However, he will one day return to be the dictator of Siam in the near future. At that time, our country's economic interests and the overseas Chinese in Siam will be in an unsustainable situation. (The End)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Call of China's Industrial and Commercial Circles</h3>
<p>Yesterday, following the presidents of various universities, prominent figures from Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles jointly telegraphed the American authorities, explaining that China's current distressing situation is part of the global malaise following the war. The Chinese people and government, in addition to continuing their own efforts to seek reform and progress, deeply believe and hope that the United States will, based on its sympathy and friendship, assist China. Those who signed this telegram are all representatives of Shanghai and even national industrial, commercial, and financial organizations. Therefore, this brief telegram is nothing less than the call of free individuals in China's industrial and commercial circles.</p>
<p>The call of the representatives of industrial and commercial circles is as important as the call of the presidents of Shanghai's universities the other day because it can at least represent three points:</p>
<p>(1) These figures who can represent China's legitimate industry and commerce, like the educators, are not, as stated in General Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China, "filled with a decadent defeatism," nor do they adopt "an attitude of indifference." On the contrary, they eagerly wished to await the visiting opinions of the investigation team, but regrettably did not get the opportunity, so that Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China did not even mention the name of the major city of "Shanghai."</p>
<p>(2) This group of free individuals in industry and commerce "do not want to gloss over the extremely distressing situation in China today" and are extremely willing to work hard to seek reform and progress. However, they still have strong confidence in Chairman Chiang's outstanding leadership and deeply resent the destruction and rebellion caused by the communist bandits after the war. As China is about to enter an era of democratic politics, the attitude of these free individuals in industry and commerce and their professional organizations is indeed worthy of attention.</p>
<p>(3) Although they did not, like the university presidents, believe that the eight years of the War of Resistance and the two years of being trapped in war after the war were the reasons for the deteriorating situation, they did clearly point out "the widespread imbalance of the world after the war" and that "the China problem should be regarded as part of the widespread global malaise," which should not be dismissed as the empty talk of "Chinese people are accustomed to blaming others" as said by some American newspapers.</p>
<p>Since World War II, people have long believed that war and peace are inseparable. When Japan invaded China in 1937, although President Roosevelt delivered his astonishing speech on quarantine in Chicago, the flames of war in Asia and Europe eventually burned the heads of Americans! Regarding the situation in China today, we Chinese people should naturally bear a major responsibility, but it is feared that no one can deny that this is a partial manifestation of the widespread global malaise. The so-called widespread global malaise, in essence, is that the people of all long-war-weary countries generally live in hardship, and everywhere they encounter ideological conflicts between the totalitarian communist system and the liberal democratic system--this conflict may unfortunately be the source of the Third World War. China is particularly unfortunate to be at the forefront of this conflict! Therefore, the situation in China must not be regarded as a purely Chinese problem.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese people--especially the free individuals in society--on the one hand, should remind the United States and other friendly countries to correct their attitude of watching the fire from across the river, or the perspective of scratching an itch from outside the boot; but on the other hand, they should redouble their self-reflection, accelerate unity, and intensify their efforts to fully exert their strength and urge the government to implement reforms to eliminate corruption and strengthen administrative efficiency. China's emerging industrialists and merchants are still in their infancy, and their role as the backbone of democratic constitutionalism should be no different from the historical evolution of Western democratic countries. Now that they have made their call, they should not underestimate themselves and make further efforts.</p>
<p>We believe that the United States will not abandon China. We further believe that the United States will be able to lend a helping hand to China when China's liberal educators or industrialists and merchants rise up to promote political and economic reforms, so as to restore China's peace, stability, and prosperity.</p>

<h3>Truman Declares to the Brazilian Congress: The United States Is Determined to Support the United Nations; Friendship Between the United States and Brazil Becomes Closer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 6th Dispatch: President Truman addressed a joint session of the Brazilian Congress today, expressing confidence in the United Nations, stating: "The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance has set an example for international cooperation among free people. At present, nations are still far from peace, and the difficulty of the task is far greater than we expected. Nations must intensify cooperation and strive for common goals, namely morality and justice. Turmoil has begun throughout the world. Although our country has also made great sacrifices in the war, it has been spared from enormous destruction. Brazil and the United States must live up to expectations and fight for the freedom of millions of people. The American people place great hope in the Inter-American Conference that is about to conclude. The agreements established this time will benefit the entire world. The capital of Brazil will become a famous city in history, promoting understanding among nations and establishing law and order. Some parties have expressed disappointment with the achievements of the United Nations, but we must not give up our efforts, because the United Nations is what we need most. We must keep in mind that the task of the United Nations is not to solve problems directly caused by war, but to maintain international peace after a fair resolution is obtained. After the Charter was signed, the United Nations did not fully grow up. We should reach our goals with patience. The United Nations is by no means a temporary organization, but a hub for safeguarding the welfare and peace of the world's people. The difficulties encountered in the early stages should not discourage us. On the contrary, the United States is determined to support the United Nations with all its resources. The United States and Brazil have much in common, and both countries have confidence in basic human rights. The two countries think alike, and friendship is growing day by day."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 4th] A spokesman for the White House entourage said: He has not heard that President Truman intends to fly directly from Rio back to Washington. The President's latest plan is that his special plane will be waiting in Trinidad. It is estimated that the President will travel from the capital of Brazil to Trinidad on the battleship "Missouri," and then transfer to a plane to return to the United States. The "Missouri" will travel at a speed of thirty miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Secretary Marshall and Senator Vandenberg Praise the Achievements of the Pan-American Conference; Canada Does Not Participate in the Declaration of Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall returned to the country today from the capital of Brazil and delivered a broadcast, saying, "The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance is sufficient to prove that if countries sincerely promote world peace and human happiness, they can achieve their wishes." Marshall also mentioned the protracted and difficult situation of negotiations with the Soviet Union, saying, "Our two years of efforts to create peace in Europe can also be completed without obstruction, delay, or disruptive propaganda." Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, broadcast that "The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance is a ray of sunshine in a dark world. What we are doing is not against anyone. If anyone suspects that we have other purposes, they are simply revealing their own thoughts. This nineteen-nation treaty does not prejudice any country's responsibilities to the United Nations. Our actions do not contain any thoughts of conquest or imperialism, but are only efforts for international truth and security." He concluded by saying that he will submit this treaty to the Senate for its approval.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 4th] The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs announced: Canada has rejected Argentina's proposal and does not want to join other American countries and the Holy See in issuing a declaration of peace principles. Canadian Foreign Minister Laurent responded to the Argentine government's note, stating that Canada fully agrees with the goals of this proposal. However, it feels that resolving world difficulties should be done through the United Nations organization.</p>
<h3>US Congressional Inspection Team Arrives in Berlin from England</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th] The US Congressional inspection team arrived in Berlin today to study the actual needs of various countries and their people. This study is part of the Marshall Plan, and the results obtained will be submitted to the relevant congressional committees, which will then propose legislation. The inspection team's final report is expected to be completed before March 1, 1948. Its scope includes Europe and Asia, but only three members of the inspection team will go to the Far East, and their stay will be much shorter than in Europe. It can be said that from the perspective of the Marshall Plan, Asia's position will be secondary to Europe.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Arrives in Lima</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 5th] Wedemeyer and other members of the delegation arrived in Lima and will stay at the Kirillo Military Rest Camp for a week, preparing to submit a report on China and Korea to Truman. After returning to Washington, the report will be submitted directly to Marshall.</p>
<h3>Sixteen European Countries Plan to Purchase Ships from the United States</h3>
<p>Plan to Purchase 3 Million Tons in Four Years</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] A spokesman for the Maritime Transport Technical Committee of the Sixteen-Nation European Economic Cooperation Conference said: The participating countries plan to purchase 3 million tons of ships from the United States between now and 1951, worth approximately $300 million. European countries have specifically submitted a report to Washington, explaining the common needs and common plans for purchasing ships, and explaining the individual needs and plans of each country. The aforementioned figures are provisional quantities, but it is expected that there will not be much change. The spokesman also said: In addition to the ship purchase plan, European countries also plan a large-scale shipbuilding plan, with a total dry cargo ship tonnage of 39.2 million tons and a total oil tanker tonnage of 14.4 million tons expected by the end of 1951.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Condemns Hoover</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] US Congressman Sabath recently published an article in the newspaper, criticizing former President Hoover for following the propaganda lines of Japan and the Nazis, and said that Hoover should remember that Roosevelt and Hull did their best to repel Japan.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of the Navy Sternly Condemns the Abuse of the Veto Power</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cleveland, 5th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars today, criticizing cruel totalitarian leaders. It is said that the development of the United Nations organization has been hindered by the abuse of the veto power. The rule of totalitarian governments always disregards public opinion and only represents a few cold-blooded ambitious people at home and abroad. Having already controlled several countries, they now intend to apply their iron fists to other countries.</p>
<h3>Truman May Return to the Country Early to Approve New Measures to Aid Europe; Congress May Convene a Special Session to Pass Them</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] Sources here say: President Truman may return to Washington from Latin America early to approve the emergency aid plan for Europe that is currently under study. This plan may be passed by a special session of Congress convened in November.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall has now begun to intensify consultations with his senior experts in the hope that he can establish a definitive system within two weeks before he attends the next United Nations General Assembly. This system is based on the view of the United States that the situation in Europe is deteriorating and will be out of control by the end of the year. Sources expect that the presumed timetable for the United States to pass a temporary emergency aid plan for Europe is approximately as follows: (1) The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the House and Senate will soon begin listening to opinions on this matter, so that key members of Congress can become familiar with the situation of the European crisis; (2) The two houses will convene a special plenary session in early November to approve 3 billion yuan for temporary emergency aid to Europe before the Marshall Plan is implemented; (3) After the temporary aid plan begins to be implemented, the legislative procedures for completing the Marshall Aid Europe Plan will be carried out immediately, so that the European recovery plan can be launched immediately after passing through the dangerous winter period. It is rumored that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have now agreed that in order to prevent the complete collapse of the European economy, the United States will need to provide no less than 10 billion yuan in assistance. The success of the temporary emergency aid plan for Europe, which was first revealed by Under Secretary of State Lovett on the 3rd, depends on the attitude of Congress, and the attitude of Congress largely depends on the results of the consultations between Secretary of State Marshall and Senator Vandenberg and key figures in Congress in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Soviet Ambassador to Greece Dismissed</h3>

<h3>The People's Freedom Party Reaches an Understanding; The Greek Cabinet Broadens Its Base; US Envoy Achieves Success After a Day of Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 5th] US envoy Henderson, Director of the Near East Division of the State Department, conducted a day of negotiations to enable Tsaldaris, leader of the Greek People's Party, and Sophoulis, leader of the Freedom Party, to reach an understanding, so as to expand the foundation of the Greek government, and has almost achieved success.</p>
<p>When the parliament resumed its summer recess today, Tsaldaris, on behalf of his People's Party cabinet, issued a brief policy statement, but the debate on the statement has been rescheduled, presumably because Tsaldaris believes that Henderson's negotiations will be successful. Henderson's purpose is to establish an expanded cabinet based on the People's Party and the Freedom Party. Henderson's negotiations are still continuing today, but it is not yet possible to verify the rumor that a new coalition government led by Sophoulis can be established before the next meeting of parliament. Tsaldaris' statement to Congress today, in which he hinted that negotiations on expanding the cabinet were underway, won a lot of cheers. Tsaldaris said: "The date for the Greek case to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly again is very close. I will do my best to enable the parties that won the 1946 March elections to complete full cooperation."</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 4th] Well-informed sources said today: The Freedom and People's Parties have reached an agreement to nominate Sophoulis, leader of the Freedom Party, as the new Prime Minister of Greece.</p>

<h3>Both Diplomacy and Military Affairs Are in a Difficult Situation; Dutch Army Launches Another Offensive; The Netherlands Decides to Invite Belgium to Be a Representative of the Three-Person Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 4th] The Indonesian Gazette said: The Dutch army launched a large-scale offensive in eastern and central Java, and conducted air operations, attacking Nigakidjipolok east of Malang in eastern Java and the Nigara district in central Java. Dutch ships have been very active for two days, and Nagalingdom and Kota in western Java have been attacked by Dutch aircraft.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 4th] According to well-informed sources in Batavia, the Dutch army has decided to launch another offensive against Yogyakarta. The motive is that the Dutch side is now in an unsustainable position. On the one hand, it is determined to recover the colony so that the rich products of the East Indies can be exported to the world's urgently needed markets. On the other hand, since the Security Council ordered a ceasefire, although the Dutch army has retained the richest agricultural areas of Java and Sumatra, the continuous infiltration of Indonesian armed guerrillas has made it impossible for the Dutch to return to the farms to develop them. The Dutch can no longer wait patiently, so it is necessary to resolve the issue by military means.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] A spokesman for the United Nations Dutch delegation confirmed reports that the delegation had invited Belgium to be a representative of the three-person committee of the Security Council, and that Belgium had accepted.

<h3>Head of Indian Trade Mission to Japan Criticizes US Monopoly Policy</h3>
<p>Allied Merchants Increase Purchase Volume</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Kirachand, head of the Indian trade mission to Japan, attacked the United States' "vested interests" on the 5th, prohibiting the free exchange of trade with Japan. This is the first time that a representative of the Allied governments' remaining inspection has attacked the United States for implementing an economic policy. He attacked American merchants for wanting to sell Japanese textiles at absurdly high prices, so that the prices of their domestic textiles would not be reduced. At the same time, American cotton could also be sold to Japan at high prices. In this way, the United States could sell more cotton to Japan than other countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] MacArthur's headquarters' Economics and Science Division announced today: Allied merchants have purchased approximately $350,000 worth of goods from Japan, including $130,000 in groceries, $200,000 in agricultural and marine products, and $8,000 in textiles.

<h3>Provincial and Municipal Boundary Demarcation: Ordered to be Resolved; Qibao's Eastern Area and Dachang Entirely Under Shanghai Municipality; Subsidies Still Executed According to the 17th Year Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the boundary demarcation issue between Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu Province, the Ministry of Interior successively dispatched personnel to conduct on-site surveys and convened boundary demarcation meetings with representatives from both the province and the municipality. After several discussions, the demarcation situation became quite clear. Based on factual needs and legal provisions, a draft demarcation line and subsidy method were formulated. Yesterday, the municipal government received an executive order for notification. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Demarcation: (1) Southern Shanghai: Shanghai County retains jurisdiction over all eight districts including Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, Maqiao, Minhang, Chenxing, Caoxing, Sanlin, and Tangwan, as well as the eastern part of Xinzhuang District and the western part of Zhoupu District. The provincial and municipal boundary line follows the original district boundaries. The eastern part of Xinzhuang District, originally under the jurisdiction of Songjiang County, is re-designated due to its proximity to Beiqiao Town, the seat of Shanghai County, making it easier to govern. The western part of Zhoupu District, originally under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County, is re-designated because it is embedded between the Sanlin and Chenxing Districts of Shanghai County, making administration extremely inconvenient. Furthermore, Shanghai County has a smaller area and population than Songjiang and Nanhui, so the re-designation is also necessary to balance the resources. The eastern part of Qibao District is designated under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality. (2) Northern Shanghai: The entire Dachang area is designated under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality. The entire Yanghang area remains under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County.

<h3>Reporting Enemy-Puppet Poisoning Criminals</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice Transmits the Internal Explanation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Interior previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, instructing all levels of courts to report cases of enemy-puppet poisoning criminals and submit a list. The courts were quite skeptical about this. It was unclear whether the so-called enemy-puppet poisoning crime included violations of the anti-smoking and anti-drug laws committed by ordinary people, and what the scope was. They requested an explanation. The city's court received a letter from the Ministry of Judicial Administration transferring a letter from the Ministry of Interior yesterday, stating that the enemy-puppet poisoning criminals to be reported and punished referred to people from China, Japan, and Korea who had previously worked in puppet anti-smoking agencies or other poisoning institutions and had implemented or helped implement poisoning activities. General violations of the law by ordinary people are not included in the scope of this case. Furthermore, the court's report on the trial situation should clearly state the judgment and sentence for compilation purposes.</p>

<h3>Black Market Gold Organization Cracked on Huqiu Road; Quanchang Transportation Trading Company Searched; Huadong Company Suspected of Gold Pawn</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the cracking of a large-scale gold case on Jinling East Road, the Police Bureau's Economic Division cracked a similar organization at Quanchang Transportation Trading Company, 75 Huqiu Road, at 11:00 AM yesterday. Because the investigation is not yet complete, the full truth of the case will be revealed this afternoon. It is reported that the organization was cracked after the Central Bank received a tip-off, which was delivered to the Police Bureau's Economic Division yesterday morning. After Division Chief Xu requested instructions from Director Ruan, a large number of personnel were dispatched. In addition to 75 Huqiu Road, several other companies related to the place were also searched at the same time. Several people were taken into custody for questioning due to serious suspicion. It was learned that Quanchang Company was established not long ago and usually engaged in import and export trade and transportation customs declaration as its business, with Zhou Yiqun as the manager. When the police bureau searched the company yesterday, important account books and evidence of gold trading were reportedly found in the mezzanine on the second floor of the building. Therefore, the lower floor may be a smokescreen for external purposes.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Huadong Securities Company, Room 512, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road, was investigated by the police bureau the day before yesterday on suspicion of gold pawning. However, when the person in charge of the company was summoned yesterday, they firmly denied it and only said that they were temporarily holding it for a friend.</p>
<h3>Self-Reliance in the Cultural and Educational Circles; Cooperative Opens Today; Pan Gongzhan Discusses the Significance of Its Establishment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cultural Credit Cooperative is scheduled to open today. Yesterday, reporters specially interviewed Mr. Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the cooperative's board of directors, and Mr. Jiang Jianbai, concurrently general manager, who explained the significance of the cooperative's establishment and its future plans in detail. According to Mr. Pan, the establishment of the Shanghai Cultural Credit Cooperative has the following significance: 1. The cooperative system is the first step towards a democratic economy; the education and culture circles are in a leading position in society. If they can promote the cooperative system themselves, it can be expanded to the entire society, building the foundation of a democratic economy. The establishment of the Cultural Credit Cooperative is to lead society in promoting the economic cooperation movement. 2. Education and culture are originally social undertakings. It is most ideal to support socialized education and culture undertakings with a socialized economic cooperation system. The establishment of the Cultural Credit Cooperative is to seek self-reliance for the education and culture circles. 3. Educational and cultural undertakings rarely receive economic assistance. For example, government funding is limited to industry and commerce, and bank overdrafts are not preferential. In order to expand business facilities or improve the lives of practitioners, the education and culture circles have no choice but to resort to high-interest loans, which is a major crisis for the education and culture circles. The establishment of the Cultural Credit Cooperative is to resolve this crisis.</p>
<p>Business Plan</p>
<p>According to Jiang Jianbai, the first businesses to be launched include the following: 1. Deposits: Schools that are group members of the cooperative can deposit their school establishment funds and tuition fees into the cooperative in accordance with cooperative principles. In addition, members who operate cultural businesses or cultural organizations that have joined the cooperative can also deposit their funds or income and surplus funds into the cooperative, and they will be given preferential treatment. 2. Loans: A. Publishing loans: Cultural workers who have joined the cooperative and are unable to publish their works can apply for publishing loans. B. Production loans: Members who have cultural products, such as films from the film industry and books from the publishing industry, can apply for publishing loans if they have insufficient funds. C. Teacher assistance loans: Members who are teachers can apply for loans when they have legitimate needs. D. Student assistance loans: Children of members who are studying can apply for student assistance loans. E. Production loans: Cultural members who are running production businesses can apply for production loans when they need funds. 3. Agency collection and payment: Cultural members who establish companies and firms can entrust the cooperative to collect share funds, and schools can also entrust the cooperative to collect tuition fees. The cooperative can also be entrusted to pay funds. 4. Investment: The cooperative may participate in the investment of group members who establish cultural undertakings, depending on the circumstances. 5. The cooperative will do its best to assist members of the education and culture circles who need financing or guidance for their welfare and the development of their businesses.</p>

<h3>Rescuing Students Who Have Dropped Out of School; Benefiting the Poor; Qixin Advertising Company Donates a Large Sum to Help Students</h3>
<p>The "Reader's Scholarship" has been able to be launched smoothly. Various advertising companies in the city have given us a lot of sponsorship and encouragement. Despite being busy with their business and under the high heat of Baidu, they have been running around for us, calling for us, and soliciting donations for us. Their goal is exactly the same as ours, which is for countless poor students. They cannot bear to see these promising and promising young students who cannot afford to pay for tuition suffer the misfortune of dropping out of school. Yesterday, Qixin Advertising Company raised 8 million yuan in scholarships for us. They wrote to us saying: "Your newspaper is dedicated to rescuing young people who have dropped out of school, providing scholarships, and benefiting the poor. We are deeply impressed by your enthusiasm for education. In response to the righteous cause, our company has not only donated 1.55 million national currency on its own, but also raised 6.45 million yuan from all walks of life, totaling 8 million yuan. We are hereby sending it to you for inspection." We deeply admire Mr. Hu Tanming, the manager of Qixin, for his enthusiasm in helping students.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Ying Yongwang donated a team of ordinary students to celebrate Mr. Qian Xinzhi's 63rd birthday, which happened to be ranked in the 63rd team. It is truly a coincidence. We express our highest respect for these great sympathies.</p>
<p>Our newspaper hopes that thousands of readers will all solicit donations and donate to help us, with the same effect. Let us achieve the goal of 1 billion yuan as soon as possible. We are extremely eager to do so. (Donation report published in the Social Services column) Xuefan.

Therefore, it sent more than 20 plainclothes police officers to surround and search the temple at 2:00 PM yesterday. As a result, nothing was found. At that time, Qingliang Temple did not know the truth and mistakenly thought that bandits had kidnapped them. They reported to the Jiangning Police Branch, which sent personnel to investigate. They learned that it was an order from the Criminal Division of the General Bureau and took the three monks including Xuefan to the police station. Later, it was found that the informants were Liudu and Xinling, perhaps because Xuefan and Xuelei were only one word different, intentionally containing retaliatory behavior. They were also detained and will be investigated and prosecuted.</p>

<h3>Bai Lu's Words Became a Prophecy: Hope Vanished Like a Bubble·Eternal Farewell to the World: Family Decides to Sue the Court, Seeking to Ascertain Responsibility for the Accident</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the tragic death of Bai Lu in a staircase fall, the public prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Fang Zheng, personally inspected the International Hotel yesterday morning. In the afternoon at 3 p.m., Bai Lu's family and members of the film and theater industry met with the press at the Jin Gu Hotel to explain several points: (1) The deceased's family has decided to file a lawsuit with the court this time, with the aim of determining right and wrong and responsibility for the accident. (2) The deceased was in extremely normal health before the accident, and rumors that the main cause of her fall was mental confusion are completely untrue. (3) In the future, any compensation obtained after the civil lawsuit will be used entirely for the benefit fund of actors in this city. Subsequently, Feng Zi reported on Bai Lu's character, stating that he would, as a longtime classmate, appeal to society for justice for the deceased. Following this, Xia Yunhu, director of Kunlun Film Company, and others recounted the incident, saying that Bai Lu left the International Hotel in the early morning to fetch something from Wang Renmei's house, and Ding Ting accompanied her on her return to the International Hotel. At the time of the accident, the outer iron door of the elevator was indeed not closed. Bai Lu, in her haste to return, did not check and stepped in, resulting in the tragic accident. The elevator operator heard a scream between the second and third floors at the time, proving that the iron door was not opened by Bai Lu herself, but rather due to a malfunctioning button. Subsequently, they conducted multiple on-site tests at the International Hotel, and on the day of Bai Lu's encoffining, the International Hotel hung a "Repair" sign next to the elevator. Whether judged by common sense or reasoning, the International Hotel authorities are undeniably responsible for negligence in their duties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Kunlun Company, another task of Bai Lu's trip to Shanghai was to film a new movie called "Hope in the World" at the invitation of the company. Unexpectedly, the title became a self-fulfilling prophecy, hope vanished like a bubble, and she bid farewell to the world forever.</p>
<h3>Terrible Lung Disease: Report from a Chinese Clinic Shows Sharp Increase in Outpatients</h3>

Yao, chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau, was invited to attend. Fu Zhengmo, commander of the division service district, addressed the meeting. The district chiefs reported on the current situation of volunteer registration in their respective districts, with about three points: (1) Volunteer registration is not enthusiastic. (2) Those who are willing to register as volunteers mostly have no guarantors. (3) The general consensus is that the family allowance of 4 million yuan is too small. Chief Yao then reported two points: (1) Registered volunteers can be sent to the new recruit conscription center first, and the meals will be arranged by the municipal government in consultation with the Military Service Association. (2) The municipal government has ordered all districts to organize committees to comfort drafted soldiers and raise additional family allowances to remedy the situation. After discussion, the following was decided: (1) Each district will convene meetings of baojia heads to strengthen military service work and discuss ways to raise additional family allowances, and actively carry out the work. (2) If the number of volunteers falls short of the quota by the deadline, it will be decided to conscript by lottery in accordance with the law, after consultation with Mayor Wu. During this period, the Military Service Association will be requested to expedite the work of exemption and deferment review, so that it will be convenient to conduct lottery conscription if necessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday's newspaper reported that the registration of volunteers in this city had begun yesterday, which Chief Yao of the Military Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau stated was inaccurate. It is said that the draft of the document proposing to start conscription on the 15th has been submitted to the mayor for approval, and it is currently impossible to determine whether conscription will begin as scheduled. Yao pointed out that the fact that the family allowance for volunteers has not yet begun to be collected is the reason for the delayed deadline for conscription. It is also reported that the registration of volunteers has been changed to be handled uniformly by the Civil Affairs Bureau, which is also not true.</p>
<h3>Director Fang of the Party Headquarters Gave Instructions to Soldiers Going to War</h3>
<p>Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters gave instructions to the soldiers going to war in Jiangwan yesterday morning, saying: "The ancients said, 'War is dangerous,' which shows that the use of force is a last resort. We have just driven out the Japanese after eight years of arduous struggle, and the communists are taking the opportunity to make trouble, obstructing the work of recovery and reconstruction, undermining the unity and peace of the country, and preventing the people from living and working in peace. Just look at the places where the communists have gone, killing, arson, rape, and plunder are rampant, causing the people to cry out in misery. As long as the communists are not eliminated, the country will not be able to recover and rebuild, and the people will not be able to live and work in peace. In order to save the country, the nation, and our compatriots, we must thoroughly eliminate the communists. Therefore, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the country has no choice but to endure the pain and use force again to eliminate the source of chaos and complete reconstruction." After his instructions, Director Fang inspected the barracks and inquired about everything.</p>
<h3>Fourth Court in the Yu Case: Widow Brings Orphans to Court·Tearfully Requests Return of Gold Bars</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The U.S. Military Tribunal opened court at 9 a.m. yesterday to continue questioning witnesses in the murder case of Yu Shengxiao. First to testify were Wu Genhui, owner of the Fada Tailor Shop, and Ke Shanqing, a clerk at the shop. They testified that at 3 p.m. on the day of the incident, Yu Shengxiao brought five gold bars to the shop, saying that Que Li wanted to buy them from him, and a friend immediately warned him to be very careful. After Que Li arrived, Yu Shengxiao left with him. Wu Genhui also described Que Li as an obese man with a mustache and fierce eyes. Next to testify was Lu, wife of Yu Shengxiao. Lu entered the court with her young children, saying that the day before the incident, her husband came home and said that Que Li would pay the gold price in U.S. dollars, and he brought back five gold bars that night, which he weighed. The next morning at 9 a.m., he went out and never returned. She also said that on the evening of July 31, her husband told her that the other party in this transaction was a high-ranking military officer, and mentioned the name Zhu Ti Que Li. Lu, in tears, also said that after her husband's death, the whole family had nothing to live on, and she requested the court to help her maintain her family's life and retrieve the gold bars. At this time, Colonel Palermo replied that this matter was outside the scope of the military tribunal, and it had no power to allow it, nor did it have the right to make this suggestion, and hoped that the victim could make a request to the competent authority.</p>
<p>Three Orphans Have No Savings</p>
<p>Lu appeared in court with tears streaming down her face, looking very sad, saying that there were three orphans and the deceased had no savings, and their future life was worrying. The court then summoned a staff member surnamed Sun from the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, who said that when Yu Shengxiao was sent to the hospital on August 1, he had suffered three injuries and had died. He then briefly explained his injuries. Then, the court invited forensic doctor Wang Shizhi, the judge, the prosecutor, and the defendant's defense attorney to study the photos taken during the autopsy. Forensic doctor Wang repeatedly said that he was too busy at the time, so he no longer remembered the injured parts of the deceased. If the court needs formal autopsy photos, they can be retrieved from the archives. The court then summoned U.S. Navy sailor Qu Lunbei. Qu had witnessed Malay in the New Lishu Bar on the evening of August 1. He claimed that he did see Malay and a friend of his together in the bar that day, and heard Malay asking how much U.S. dollars a gold bar could be exchanged for.</p>
<p>Finally, a U.S. Army Medical Officer was Summoned</p>
<p>Finally, U.S. Army Medical Officer Major Xu was summoned. Xu, a Chinese American, was fluent in English. He gave a detailed report in court on the autopsy process, saying that all this was recorded in his notebook and a formal report had been sent to U.S. Headquarters. At this time, the defendant's defense attorney stood up to question, saying that after a person had died for fourteen days, an external autopsy was performed without dissection, and whether the conclusion was reliable. Major Xu replied that after the chest of a person had been shot twice, the chance of survival was very small. There was no doubt that Yu Shengxiao's death was due to gunshot wounds. What was now worth studying was the direction of the bullet holes on the corpse. In his opinion, the bullets entered from the front and exited from the back. At this point, the judges raised questions one after another, speculating on the cause of Yu Shengxiao's death in various ways, but no new discoveries were made other than the gunshot wounds. At 4:40 p.m., the presiding judge announced the adjournment and scheduled to reopen at 9 a.m. this morning.</p>

<h3>The Wind and Rain of Yancheng</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Dongtai, 2nd] Since the recovery of northern Jiangsu a year ago, it has been shrouded in gloom. On this fertile plain, the communists have never relaxed their grip on running rampant, creating struggles, and slaughtering in order to expand their rebellion and raise capital. People under the shadow seem to have a premonition - a storm is unavoidable in northern Jiangsu!</p>
<p>On August 1st, the communist army held a "high-level cadre meeting" in Xiaohai (one of the central Jiangsu base areas, 60 li from Dongtai). The attendees included Guan Wenwei, commander of the central Jiangsu military region, and the heads of nine counties: puppet Xinghua, Huangning, Jianyang, Sheyang, Hebei, Dongtai, Zishi, Tong, and Yandong. The meeting opened in the afternoon and closed at 5 p.m. In the three hours, the resolution to "attack Yancheng" was decided.</p>
<p>The communist forces involved in this battle included the 11th and 12th columns, about fourteen regiments, plus two attached mountain artillery companies, carrying eight mountain guns, plus other local bandits, totaling more than 30,000 people. Guan Wenwei was appointed commander, Cao Diqiu (commander of the 11th communist column) was appointed deputy commander, and Xu Jincheng, head of the "special task force of the central Jiangsu military region," was appointed chairman of rear-area operations. Each puppet county government was ordered to collect 5,000 stretcher bearers by August 5th, and Yinshuigou (50-odd li from Yancheng) was designated as the rear-area concentration point.</p>
<p>On the night of August 5th, the prelude to the war began. The communists launched an offensive toward</p>
<p>Yancheng's outlying strongholds: Nanyang'an, Shanggang, Wuyou, Gangmen, and Xinxingchang. The troops stationed in Yancheng at that time were the ××× division of the ××× army group. Due to the importance of the city's defenses, reinforcements were impossible. The local self-defense forces fought bravely but were overwhelmed, and by the afternoon of the 6th, the outlying strongholds had fallen one after another.</p>
<p>The flames of war were approaching Yancheng step by step. Yancheng was in a precarious situation, surrounded on all sides, and extremely tense. All sectors of the city formed a strong command structure, launching efforts to rush repairs on</p>
<p>street-fighting fortifications and preparing for consolation and relief.</p>
<p>The passion and desire for survival inspired the sense of justice and responsibility of everyone. The whole city comforted every soldier preparing for battle and every worker with their limited food, cigarettes, and daily necessities. The Jiangsu Provincial Bank, the China Farmers Bank, and the Yancheng office of the National Treasury temporarily allocated 150 million yuan for military labor.</p>
<p>This misfortune finally befell Yancheng. Late on the 10th, a few cannon sounds came from the four suburbs, seemingly telling people that the communist army had begun its "siege."</p>
<p>At that time, the city's defense was as follows: the west gate was defended by the people's self-defense force and four platoons of the reorganized ××× division, and the other three gates were defended by troops under the ××× army group, and their morale was very high.</p>
<p>On the 11th, the communist army used earth to attack fiercely all day, launching fourteen assaults, but failed to succeed. However, the isolated city was trapped and all external aid was cut off. At dawn on the 13th, the defending troops were exhausted, and the communist army took the opportunity to break in from the</p>
<p>south gate, carrying out a large-scale massacre. Public servants of various agencies and some of the people retreated with the troops to the fortifications of the provincial Yancheng Middle School in the north city, making a final resistance in an attempt to save the situation. However, when the nest is overturned, can there be any intact eggs? The stronghold was broken by the communists at 12 o'clock, and many heads of agencies and key personnel committed suicide on the spot.</p>
<p>After the communists entered the city, they began looting, and all the city's materials were looted. More than a thousand public servants and innocent people were killed, and more than 10,000 people were captured and escorted to communist bases such as Dazhongji and Nanyang'an, suffering greatly. (Among the government personnel who have been confirmed to have been killed, the secretary-general of the party headquarters, Wang Qidun, was shot and killed, and Liu Jianqiu, director of the Youth League, drowned in the river).</p>
<p>The city spent nine days in the midst of red terror. On the 21st, it was recovered. This surprise action by the National Army prevented the communist army from fully realizing its planned work. (According to the communist army's estimate, the National Army's reinforcements would not arrive within two weeks.) According to people from the ruined city, if the National Army had arrived one or two days later, Yancheng, even if recovered, would have become a pile of rubble. (The communist army's plan was to retreat without resistance when the National Army arrived, but to set fire to vent its anger.)</p>
<p>At present, everything in Lin City is not yet on track, but the order is very stable. The small wheel between Dongtai and Yancheng resumed sailing on the 29th of last month. The highway between Dong and Yan,</p>
<p>with the cooperation of the military and civilians in rush repairs, can also be opened to traffic within ten days. However, Yancheng is already an empty city (the materials have been robbed by the communists). Only a few women, children, and the elderly remain (the young and strong have been captured by the communists). What they look forward to is the government's ability to provide them with large-scale relief.</p>
<p>A storm nightmare has passed, and the people of northern Jiangsu are preparing to welcome the lovely blue sky and white sun! (Reporter Ling Songsou)</p>

<h3>Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group: First Announcement Yesterday of Cases Accepted: Grain Trucks Carrying Smuggled Goods and Discrepancy in Grain Amount: Wang Dekuan and Tan Yanpei Suspected and Awaiting Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] The Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group announced the cases accepted for the first time today: The Jidong Grain Department's military grain convoy for the Ministry of Grain carried a large amount of printing materials, and it was also found that the amount of grain returned differed greatly from the original amount. The Ministry of Grain previously entrusted the Northeast Economic Commission to purchase 3.57 million catties of military grain on behalf of the province. Three months ago, Wang Dekuan, a member of the Jidong Provincial Government, and Tan Yanpei, director of the military grain collection warehouse of the Tianliang Department, went to escort the army. According to reports, due to the impact of the war, only 480,000 catties of the original grain remained. When the convoy arrived in Tianjin, the Military Transportation Department inspected and found that the grain trucks were carrying 25 boxes of ink, more than 10,000 kilograms of lead bars, and six bundles of water pipes, which were detained. Wang Dekuan claimed that the transported printing equipment was under the order of the Baoding Pacification Office, and the responsibility was delayed for more than three months. Recently, it was secretly reported, and the Supervision Group found that Wang Dekuan was the chairman of the "Great Wall Printing House," and initially determined that he and Tan had major suspicions. He has now sent a letter to the Jidong Provincial Government and Tianliang Department to send the two to the court for investigation, and at the same time, to investigate the responsibility for the discrepancy in the amount of grain.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] A financial institution responsible for industrial and commercial loans has also been secretly reported for using loans for fraudulent activities, and the Supervision Group has found clues.</p>

<h3>"Land to the Tiller" - The Farmers Bank of China Holds Land Loan in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Monthly Interest at Four Percent, Limited to 25 Mu</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuhu, This Newspaper, 2nd] The land policy of "Land to the Tiller" has been initiated on a trial basis by the Farmers Bank of China in the rice-producing area of Wuhu. In April of this year, the Land Finance Division of the Farmers Bank of China dispatched Director Lu Liangyue and Dai Hongqiang to Wuhu to pioneer this new undertaking throughout Anhui Province. Tenant farmers who paid rent to landlords every year regarded the Farmers Bank of China lending them money to buy the landlords' land as a joke. However, after Lu Liangyue and others went to the countryside and genuinely completed dozens of such loan cases for tenant farmers to buy land, the villagers expressed surprise at the spirit of the current government being able to do things for the most impoverished people.</p>
<p>In the past four months, in Wuhu's Dufeng Township and Ruinan Township, a total of 76 tenant farmer households, including Cao Zhiwang, Chen Dajiang, and Yuan Yunsheng, received land purchase loans from the Farmers Bank of China and acquired land. They borrowed 4 million yuan in some cases, and 2 million yuan in others. The amount of land they purchased was limited to the tenant farmer's cultivation capacity, currently capped at 25 mu per household. These land loans had a monthly interest rate of only four percent. Principal and interest are to be repaid in full within two and a half years, in five installments. All seventy-six families, who have become self-sufficient farmers, repaid most of their loans this harvest season because the proceeds from the sale of rice from each mu of land could offset half of the land purchase loan. (They mostly bought land at a price of 200,000 yuan per mu; at present, the rice harvested from each mu is worth over 100,000 yuan.)</p>
<p>The Farmers Bank of China plans to provide 1 billion yuan in land loans to tenant farmers to buy land within a year. Following the business of buying land for farmers, the Farmers Bank of China is also cooperating with the Agricultural Extension Institute to promote improved rice varieties, firstly on the farmland purchased by tenant farmers, in order to improve agricultural production and increase yields. Chen Renjie and Shu Xiao, the managers of the Wuhu branch of the Farmers Bank of China, hope to achieve some success in Wuhu before extending the program to other areas of Anhui.</p>
<p>This is a nascent step towards the land policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood. In 1942, the Farmers Bank of China first launched this policy on North Sichuan Road, and the results were excellent. All provinces are selecting areas to implement the policy through the Farmers Bank of China, with the aim of achieving the goals of "Land to the Tiller," "Making full use of land, and making full use of human power" held by the land finance business.

<h3>Far Eastern Christian Conference Establishes Special Group to Study China's Demonstration Zone Representatives Visit Child Welfare Station and Praise the Little Teacher System</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 5th] The Far Eastern Christian Conference held its third plenary session at 10 AM on the 5th, chaired by Hang Liwu. After the meeting began, representatives from each delegation continued to report on the Christian situation in their respective regions. Wang Zongjing, the representative from Malaya, reported in detail on the Christian education situation at all levels in the Federated Malay States, noting that education for both natives and overseas Chinese was quite developed. Dick Shee, the representative from Nepal, reported that the implementation of Christian education in his country was progressing smoothly. After Wynes, the representative from Australia, reported, Sayidin, the representative from India, raised questions about education for the indigenous population. Wynes replied that the indigenous population was a nomadic society, making education extremely difficult. Sayidin stated that he had recently traveled to Australia and had some understanding of the indigenous people's lives and education, expressing hope that the Australian government would pay more attention. After Batsoni, the representative from New Zealand, reported, Wu Yifang, the representative from China, raised questions about the percentage of students advancing to higher education and the allocation of education funds. Subsequently, Chairman Hang announced the revisions to the conference agenda and the General Affairs Committee's recommendations regarding the special group. The task of this special group is to discuss the "Outline of the Basic Education Experimental Zone Plan" drafted by the Preparatory Committee (see separate dispatch) and to formulate a work plan for a "China Demonstration Design Zone." This group consists of representatives from the Joint Education Organization, Chinese experts, and other representatives with special interest in the issue. It is scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 9th, and its report will be submitted for discussion at the plenary session on the 11th. Both Hang and Professor Louis, the representative from the Joint Education Organization, emphasized the importance of this work. The results of the research will be submitted in the form of a memorandum to the Regional Research Conference of the Christian Education Conference to be held in Mexico City in November and to the Second Plenary Session of the Joint Education Organization. They hoped that all representatives would actively participate to gather wisdom and contribute insightful contributions to the global Christian education work. The attendees accepted this proposal and established the special group. Finally, they passed a reply telegram to Indian people's leader Gandhi to express thanks and adjourned the meeting at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Full Delegation Split into Groups for Visits</p>
<p>At 3 PM in the afternoon, all representatives gathered at the Academia Sinica on Beijige and departed in two groups for visits. Group A included Wynes (Australia), Yi Wan (India), Wang Zongjing (Malaya), Dick Shee and his son (Nepal), Batsoni (New Zealand), Sekuan (Thailand), Hubbard, and Aygillan (Joint Education Organization).

Later, at the Xiaguan New Life Movement General Association, the Women's Guidance Committee, and the Child Welfare Station, they first observed the children's performance of the "Little Teacher System" and solo and chorus performances. All representatives congratulated them greatly. They then listened to a report by Zhang Niangzhen, the executive director of the Guidance Committee. Group B first arrived at the First Children's Welfare Station in the Nanjing Children's Welfare Experimental Area of the Ministry of Social Affairs. All representatives were extremely satisfied with the station's children's health and nutrition equipment and were particularly interested in various recreational activities. Guo Wanglin, a 12-year-old, even created a vivid crayon portrait of Burmese representative U Ba Luan on the spot, eliciting much applause. They then went to the Fifth Central National School on Wutai Mountain to listen to a report on the school's work scope, direction, and teaching methods, and also observed the teaching in the vocational mixed classes. By 5:30 PM, both Group A and Group B had returned to the Xiangpu Camp Recreation Center to participate in a cocktail party hosted by the China Committee of the Joint Education Organization and Zhang Daofan, the chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee. There was also an exhibition of traditional Chinese paintings. According to the opinions of various representatives, they all believed that the afternoon visits were quite rewarding. They believed that China's basic education work, especially child welfare work, had already achieved remarkable results in methodology. If it could be promoted at the same standard, the results would be just around the corner. The conference is scheduled to hold two group meetings on the morning of the 6th, one for general administration and the other for content and teaching materials. In the afternoon, the entire group will visit the Gulou Kindergarten and the Zhujiang Road Central National School.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Plans to Convene Private School Representatives to Resolve the Issue of Overcharging Tuition. The Student Academic Protection Association Has Been Strictly Banned by the Municipal Government.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Mayor Wu stated to reporters yesterday morning at the Municipal Government regarding the issue of tuition standards for private schools: The tuition standards for private schools and the in-service training fees for municipal school teachers have been approved by the Education Subcommittee of the City Council on the 4th. There are two purposes: (1) To reduce the burden on parents so that students from poor families have the opportunity to study; (2) To increase teachers' salaries to stabilize their lives. Those who arbitrarily overcharge tuition like a provincial school shop will be severely banned. The government will protect schools that are well-managed and have transparent finances. The Municipal Government is continuing to solicit donations for poor student scholarships, and donations pledged from various parties have already reached 5.1 billion yuan. The review method is being discussed with various schools, and representatives from the Municipal Government, City Council, Education Bureau, and the Liaison Association of Teachers and Staff of Primary and Secondary Schools will be appointed to jointly form a review committee. Schools that overcharge tuition without the approval of the Education Bureau will be strictly banned. To date, no school has applied for approval. The Municipal Government has scheduled a meeting for the responsible parties of private primary and secondary schools on the afternoon of the 8th of this month (Monday) to discuss the matter of some schools issuing tuition notices and failing to comply with the standards before the tuition standards have been decided. The goal is to ensure that the overcharged tuition is immediately refunded by each school. Finally, Mayor Wu reiterated that the so-called "Student Academic Protection Committee" has recently been publishing announcements and selling student aid badges without the approval of government agencies. Such conduct, which abuses public power for private gain, is inappropriate and has been ordered by the Police Bureau to be strictly banned. The organizers are being investigated. He hopes that citizens will assist the government and report any violations.</p>
<h3>The Director of the Education Bureau's Supervision Department is Concurrently Held by Xie En</h3>
<p>Chen XuanShan, the Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau's Supervision Department, was ordered to go abroad for inspection, and his vacant position has been assigned to Xie EnGao, the Director of the Secondary Education Department.</p>
<h3>Hu Shih Suggests a Ten-Year Education Plan to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Exclusive Interview with This Newspaper] Dr. Hu Shih, the President of Peking University, participated in the preparatory committee for the election of academicians of the Academia Sinica in Nanjing. At the end of last month, he braved the summer heat to come south despite being ill. At that time, in a corner of the International Hotel, he refused to answer reporters' questions about the content of his conversation with Wedemeyer in Beiping. He said that even his wife could not be told.</p>
<p>The doctor will be returning to Beiping by air tomorrow morning. He just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and is staying on the 13th floor of the International Hotel. From morning till night, guests are constantly visiting, making him tired of dealing with them. In the echo of the telephone operator, he asked reporters to see him "a little later."</p>
<p>In the evening, reporters went as agreed. Dr. Hu Shih was wearing silk pajamas and was sitting peacefully on the sofa reading the evening newspaper. At the very beginning, the doctor smiled and said, "There is nothing to talk about."</p>
<p>Under the condition of not talking about "Wedemeyer," we still talked.</p>
<p>The doctor started with his participation in the preparatory committee for the election of academicians of the Academia Sinica. He said: The first review meeting will be held on the 15th of next month to decide on the list of candidates and announce it to the public. The first review meeting will be held next spring to elect 80 to 100 academicians. Afterwards, the academicians themselves will elect 15 academicians each year. After ten years, the country will have more than 200 academicians. The doctor believes that this is a major event for the country.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Christian Conference currently being held in Nanjing was not attended by the doctor. He said that we are a civilized country, but with the most illiteracy. Basic education includes compulsory education and vocational education. Now it is really necessary for us to gather with foreign experts to discuss and promote our own efforts. He hoped that after entertaining experts from various countries on tours of Jing, Hu, and Hang, the government would also invite them to Beiping to take a look.</p>
<p>From a wisp of smoke, he said: Wang Anshi was the most selfless scholar, but he argued that the first thing a scholar should do is to be selfless, which is to fully develop himself, and then do things for others after being selfless. The country has been unlucky to this day, and it is definitely not possible to overcome difficulties by shouting slogans, posting signs, or striking. Today, the country lacks science, lacks industry, and education is backward. Young people must be able to blame themselves and strive to develop themselves. Ibsen said: "The most important thing for young friends is to be able to cast themselves into vessels." Whether they are scientists, philosophers, or poets, they must always create a "vessel" from the material that their parents naturally give them. I said this thirty years ago, and I still say it now.</p>
<p>At this point, he told reporters: This time in Nanjing, he provided Chairman Chiang with a ten-year education proposal: In the next ten years, in the first five years, the government will concentrate its efforts and use large amounts of funds to develop five universities that already have a foundation. In the next five years, it will develop five other universities to make them top-notch universities in the world. The five universities in the first five years are Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Central University, and Wuhan University. The five universities in the next five years, he said, are not yet visible, and it depends on the efforts of each school. If the national universities do not work hard and have no academic achievements, it is very likely that several church universities will replace them. The doctor believes that instead of spending vast sums of foreign exchange every year to send state-funded students to study abroad, it is better to use this money to develop domestic universities. After the Meiji Restoration in Japan, it concentrated its efforts and enriched the achievements of the two universities "Tokyo" and "Kyoto," which is an excellent precedent.</p>
<p>Now there are many schools, and the strength is scattered, and there is absolutely no way to achieve results. At this point, the doctor made a prediction, which should be a warning: Not long after, China will have tens of millions of students going to Japan to study abroad, which is extremely shameful!</p>
<p>Can Chairman Chiang accept your suggestion? The doctor smiled and I said goodbye. (Qi Rong)</p>

<h3>Resolution of the National Cotton Mill Association's Board Meeting: Member Mills Withdraw from the Industrial Association; Too Few National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Seats for the Cotton Textile Industry; Dispatching Three Representatives to Beijing to Request an Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The 23rd joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the National Cotton Mill Association was held yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the conference room of the China Textile Construction Company. Du Yong, Tang Xinghai, Wu Kunsheng, Shi Fengxiang, Rong Erren, Zhang Jianbai, Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, and others attended. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM. Key points of the discussion are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the government's allocation of seats for the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan, the national textile industry received only four seats in the National Assembly and two seats in the Legislative Yuan. Considering the importance of the cotton textile industry within the textile industry, and its significant contribution to the nation and the people's livelihood, the number of seats should be increased. It was decided to dispatch three representatives, Wu Weijing, Liu Piji, and Zai Zhuyi, to Beijing next Monday to petition the Executive Yuan's Assembly and Organization departments, requesting that the number of National Assembly seats be increased to four and the number of Legislative Yuan seats be increased to two for the national cotton textile industry alone. (2) The import of industrial raw materials is currently managed and distributed entirely by the Industrial Association. However, the textile industry is vast, so the industrial raw materials needed by the textile industry should be allocated independently. (3) The National Cotton Mill Association should immediately notify its members to withdraw from the Industrial Association in order to maintain the independence of the National Cotton Mill Association. (4) The National Economic Commission is currently convening a group meeting to discuss the cotton yarn regulation plan. It was decided to dispatch Wu Weijing, Liu Jingji, Rong Erren, and Shi Fengxiang to Beijing to participate in the discussion.</p>
<h3>Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Drops Yesterday: 11,100,000 Yuan for 20-Count Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The negotiated price of 20-count cotton yarn set by the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday was lowered to 11,100,000 yuan. The prices of other counts of yarn will be calculated proportionally.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company continued to sell yarn in two groups, A and B. Group A sold 345 pieces, with 127 purchase orders. Group B sold 268 pieces, with 138 purchase orders. In total, 613 pieces were sold, equivalent to 809 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 265 purchase orders.</p>
<p>Yarn Market Continues to Decline</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation yesterday: at the opening, due to unrest in the Hubei and Henan regions, yarn transported to Wuhan was returned, and the lower negotiated prices set by the Textile Construction Company caused a sharp decline in market sentiment. Towards closing, retail investors slightly absorbed the lower prices, and prices rebounded slightly. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 17,300,000 yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was down 300,000 yuan, Light Double Horse yarn was down 350,000 yuan, 16-count Guangming yarn was down 100,000 yuan, and other yarns also continued to fall by varying amounts of up to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Market Weak</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market situation yesterday: few merchants were making purchases, and news of goods transported to Wuhan being returned from Nanjing further dampened sentiment. Cloth stores on this street, such as Xie Tai Xiang, were not buying and were instead selling. Imported Japanese goods flooded the market, and prices continued to decline. Ultimately, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 479,000 yuan, a further drop of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other grades of fine cloth, bleached cloth, twill, and blue cloth also fell by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Only Shilin cloth remained at its original price.</p>
<p>Also, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Cai E wheel, returning from Qingdao to Shanghai, transported a large batch of over 2,300 pieces of cotton yarn, in addition to raw oil and soybean oil. There were also over 200 pieces of cotton cloth, which are currently being unloaded at the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Turns Weak</p>
<p>The spot cotton market turned weak yesterday due to the decline in cotton yarn prices. Prices were slightly softer than the previous day, with a total of approximately 1,300 bales traded. The opening prices for various grades delivered to factories were: Henan Fine at 2,090,000 yuan, Fire Machine at 1,775,000 yuan to 1,800,000 yuan. The warehouse delivery prices were: Lingbao at 2,270,000 yuan to 2,280,000 yuan, Bairo at 2,220,000 yuan to 2,250,000 yuan, Henan Fine at 1,960,000 yuan to 2,000,000 yuan to 2,040,000 yuan, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton at 335,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Rationing Price Increased: 1,440,000 Yuan Per Barrel</h3>

All wholesale and retail merchants in the city must sell at the prices agreed upon above.</p>
<h3>Consolidated Bonds Stable; Foreign Stocks Steady</h3>
<p>Although government bonds fell yesterday, the process has gradually stabilized, with only slight fluctuations. Consolidated Bond C opened at 14,800 yuan, rose from 15,000 yuan, and closed at a low of 14,300 yuan. Rooms 503 and 555 both made gains, while rooms 538 and Runde both sold. As a result, Consolidated Bond D alone was flat, while Bonds A and B fell slightly by 100 yuan, and Bonds C and E fell by 300 yuan each. Turnover was no less than 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were stable yesterday, with mixed results and varying fluctuations. Ewo Yarns opened at 83,000 yuan, reached a high of 86,000 yuan, and hovered around 84,500 yuan at noon. Cantonese investors were buying, while foreign merchants and securities firms were selling. As a result, paper stocks rose by half a percentage point, while Hall &amp; Holtz and Jardine Matheson were flat. Ewo Yarns, British American Tobacco, Ewo Brewery, steel stocks, and telephone stocks rose slightly, while Jardine Properties fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Rise Again</h3>
<p>The cigarette market situation yesterday: due to the high cost of raw materials, increased wages, and adjustments by the manufacturers, merchants were eagerly buying, and prices rose again. In the afternoon, there were more buyers than sellers, and the market was further hyped. Finally, ten-packs of British American Tobacco cigarettes were hyped up to 16,600,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 750,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes also rose by 650,000 yuan, to 14,500,000 yuan. Ardath cigarettes were also hyped up to 13,200,000 yuan, with a large volume of transactions. Among Chinese-made cigarettes, the Meili Golden Mouse brand was the only one that weakened due to upcoming shipments. Other brands, such as Bai Wan, Golden Crest, and Red Golden, all rose by 2,000 to 4,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, daily necessities such as soap and matches rose in price due to the surge in cigarette prices. The prices of various brands of soap also rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and matches also rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>The various domestic teas that sellers have long sought to raise in price, after finally being driven up a few days ago, sellers in the market yesterday reverted to their old ways and attempted to drive up prices. Unfortunately, due to limited sales from local streets and merchants, momentum remained weak, making it difficult to improve the situation. As a result, prices merely fluctuated at high levels. Looking ahead, there are more opportunities than risks. As for the foreign trade tea market, exporters remained on the sidelines, but supply was also very limited. As a result, there were few transactions, and the situation was fair.</p>
<p>It is understood that several export companies are still frequently trying to acquire this year's new black tea, but the goods have not yet arrived in this city. To meet urgent needs, it is said that old Anhua tea from last year will be re-inspected in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchants Request Extension of 7-Day Delivery Deadline for Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Yarn Merchants Association recently reported to the Textile Adjustment Committee that its members are experiencing difficulties with the Textile Adjustment Committee's requirement that cotton yarn warehouse receipts purchased from the association must be delivered within seven days. The contents of the report are as follows:</p>
<p>(Omitted heading.) The cotton yarn traded by our yarn merchants is mostly sold in bulk to merchants from various regions for transshipment, in addition to a small amount supplied to retail stores. Since the implementation of transshipment control measures, the procedures for applying for transshipment permits have been very complicated. From the application to the issuance of the permit takes a long time. As an example, the application procedures for transshipment of cotton yarn in July of this year were not approved until August 30. After receiving the approval notice, it is necessary to wait for the ship schedule, customs declaration, and other procedures before obtaining the permit and officially shipping the goods, which takes a considerable amount of time. Furthermore, transshipment applications are only accepted once a month, limited to the 20th of each month. Whether or not the application is approved depends on the allocation and approval of the specified quota. Requiring that the warehouse receipts be delivered and shipped within seven days is not feasible.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Oversupplied, Buying Interest Declines Further</h3>
<p>The buying interest in Chinese stocks declined further yesterday, with continued oversupply and many investors continuing to liquidate their positions. In addition, yarn prices fell again significantly, and most of the telephone orders from outside the market were cancelled. Sellers became more active, gradually lowering prices, causing Wing On to close at a low price without any resistance.</p>
<p>The market opened low in the morning, with forward Wing On opening at 242 yuan. After Nos. 111 and others sold, it fell to 237 yuan. Nos. 126 and others bought, rising to 241 yuan. Nos. 97 and others sold, and Nos. 36 and others, as well as scattered buyers, made offers. No. 50 made a strong purchase of current Wing On, and it rebounded to 243 yuan. Nos. 111 and others sold, falling to 239 yuan.</p>
<p>After 10:30 AM, the interest rate outside the market opened low at 1.35 fen and 1.8 fen, and No. 65 was still buying, so it was slightly stable. However, yarn prices were reported to be much lower, and Nos. 94 and others sold. Nos. 107 and 99 strongly sold current Wing On. Near noon, scattered buyers were eager to liquidate their positions, causing sellers to gain the upper hand. Without any resistance, forward Wing On closed at 227 yuan and 233 yuan. After the close, quoted prices were slightly stable.</p>
<p>As a result, current delivery stocks Sino-British and Qunxing fell by about half a percentage point. Wing On, American Asiatic, Huafeng, and Jingfu fell slightly. Sino-French, Xinhua, Wing On, and Xingguang were flat. Chinese Silk rose slightly, Datong fell by 10%, and the rest fell slightly. Among forward delivery stocks, Wing On, American Asiatic, Sino-British, and Huafeng fell by half a percentage point. Xingguang, Wing On, and Jingfu fell slightly. The situation of old stocks outside the market was slightly weak.</p>
<h3>National Bank Asks Executive Yuan for Instructions on Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Students</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The National Bank is asking the Executive Yuan for instructions on whether to settle foreign exchange for self-funded students at the official exchange rate or the market exchange rate. However, for those who had applied and been approved before the amended foreign exchange control measures were announced on August 18, and who had paid legal tender to the National Bank's Business Bureau and obtained foreign exchange settlement documents, foreign exchange settlement will be permitted at the official exchange rate. The rest must wait for instructions from the Executive Yuan before a decision can be made. Also, from August 18 to the present, the National Bank's Non-Import Foreign Exchange Examination Committee has examined 364 foreign exchange applications.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Stores Rice for Sale as Food Prices Rise for Days; Early and Thin Rice Breaks 500,000 Mark</h3>
<p>Rice prices have been rising recently due to rising prices in the producing areas and scarce supplies, leading to rampant inflation. According to the person in charge of the Food Section of the Social Bureau, in addition to the Social Bureau cooperating with the Economic Police of the Police Bureau to conduct inspections in the market at any time, they stated that reports that the policy of resuming sales of stored rice would not be implemented at present, for the following three reasons: (1) To prevent the reverse flow of grain. (2) New grains are about to enter the market, and if rice prices are rigidly regulated, it may affect future supplies. (3) Currently, the prices of mid-grade and low-grade rice have not fluctuated drastically.</p>
<p>However, the person in charge solemnly stated that selling stored rice is the established policy of the Grain Bureau of the Trust Bureau and the Social Bureau, and the Social Bureau is storing rice in preparation. If it becomes necessary, it will legally sell large quantities to the market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been learned that the reasons for the recent fluctuations in rice prices are: (1) Smuggling has not been curbed, with thousands of dan being transported directly from producing areas such as Wuxi and Jiangyin to bandit areas every day, and another party is manipulating the external transport of large quantities of rice. (3) The impact of the Wuhan war has prevented rice from Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces from being transported smoothly.</p>
<p>Scarce Arrivals Lead to Price Increases</p>
<p>Also, yesterday a total of 5,200 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The gap between early and thin rice being new and old caused prices to continue to soar by 20,000 yuan, breaking the 500,000 mark. Japonica rice also rose by more than 10,000 yuan. New japonica continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. White Yin Yuan stood firm, while Indica rice was abundant in supply, with both new and old arrivals, and the situation was relatively moderate, with high-quality goods showing a slight rise, while mid-grade and low-grade goods remained mediocre.</p>
<p>The price of flour remained temporarily fixed, and the price of rationed flour remained unchanged. Standard flour showed a slight rise, while miscellaneous brands remained fixed. Wheat bran supply and demand were not strong, and there were no fluctuations. Soybean cake continued to be supplied from Taiwan, and the situation remained firm. Soybean prices rose in the producing areas, and the supply was not abundant. Merchants on local streets and oil factories were trading, and the underlying sentiment was firm.</p>
<p>Tea beans were slightly picked up in Southeast Asia, with high prices and sluggish lower grades. Garden peas were purchased in Shantou, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sorghum was also inquired about in South China, and local merchants were converting stocks, gradually rising, with another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan increase. Red sorghum from Qingdao was being actively processed, with a continued rise of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and the market was active. Corn was slightly improved from the North Sea, weakening in the morning but firming in the afternoon, with no significant gains or losses. Sesame seeds were returned by foreign companies and could not be re-exported. Local merchants were casually accepting them, with high-quality goods stable and mid- to low-quality goods falling by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were in a slump, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. New raw peanuts continued to plummet by 60,000 yuan, with no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>The price of rationed goods in Shantou remained unchanged, and the market experienced mixed gains and losses. Clear oil was scarce and stood firm, rising by another 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Raw oil was sluggish, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Soybean oil was flat, rapeseed oil fell slightly by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and sesame oil was dull and inactive.</p>
<p>Cedar Wood Stable</p>
<p>Cedar wood prices in the producing areas of Fujian Province were affected by hurricane damage, so the price was around 2,100 yuan. The Shanghai market was tight on credit, and buyer interest was slightly weak, but the underlying sentiment was quite stable.</p>
<h3>Non-Quota Imports Will Be Carefully Reviewed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Yang Hengtan, the newly appointed director of the Non-Quota Import Review Department of the Import and Export Management Committee, the review work of the imported goods in Schedules 1 and 3A under the department's jurisdiction will be handled carefully in the future. For example, for imported goods in Schedule 1, those engaged in production and public utilities should be entitled to apply for foreign exchange. In the future, the types of imported goods will be specified, and applicants will in principle be limited to direct users of the goods. Each applicant will be registered. If there are too many applications, the relevant authorities such as the Capital Commission, the Industrial Association, the National Federation of Commerce, and the Industrial and Commercial Counseling Office will be asked to jointly review them to ensure transparency. Furthermore, importers belonging to Schedule 1 who have their own foreign exchange will be given special consideration. The situation for imported goods in Schedule 3A is more complicated, and Li Gan, the deputy director of the Import and Export Management Committee, is currently studying a reasonable solution. It is reported that in order to protect the rights and interests of consumers, the profits of importers will be regulated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the South China Import and Export Management Committee has not yet been established despite a period of preparation. It is reported that the date of the committee's establishment will be decided after Jia Jiao, the director of the Import and Export Management Committee, inspects Pengnan.</p>

<h3>Flannel Arrivals Abundant</h3>
<p>Various kinds of fine wool Western-style and Chinese-style flannel have been quite abundant in the market recently. Many private and public shipments have arrived from Hong Kong, and Japanese goods are also in good supply. Factories such as Yinfeng, Zhanghua, and Xinhua have also launched large quantities of products, as their wool materials were fixed at a previous official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan, making the weaving of flannel extremely profitable. Therefore, the weaving of flannel is widespread, and arrivals are abundant, but prices have all risen compared to last week.</p>

<h3>Telegraph Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Answered by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau.</p>
<p>[Question from Wu Xinhai, No. 123 Yu Hang Road] (1) The fee for telegraph registration at your bureau seems too high. For the sake of developing business, you should strive to reduce it. Also, why are registered numbers often unavailable? (Answer) The registration fee is 120,000 yuan per year, which is collected in accordance with regulations. If you want to save money, you can apply for short-term registration, which is 30,000 yuan per term for three months. Telegraph registration at this bureau is limited to four-digit numbers (from 0001 to 9999), which is insufficient to meet demand. However, there are no restrictions on English registrations, which can be used at any time and are also applicable to Chinese telegraphs. We are planning to create five-digit number registrations soon, which will be available in large quantities. (2) Why doesn't your bureau compile and print a new telegraph codebook itself? (Answer) A new telegraph codebook is being compiled and printed and will be available for public sale soon. (3) Can telegraphs be sent and received via telephone? (Answer) The method of sending and receiving telegrams via local telephone has been in practice for a long time. If you wish to use it, please apply for registration at the business section of this bureau. (4) Is there a time limit for telegrams? Why is the time limit often exceeded? (Answer) There are regulations regarding the time limit for telegram delivery. Express telegrams are one and a half hours, urgent telegrams are four hours, and ordinary telegrams are eight hours. If the time limit is exceeded, it is generally due to obstacles on the telegraph lines. (Question from a billing account customer) Billing telegrams were originally established for the convenience of customers, but your bureau's billing telegrams are only received from 9:00 AM and stop at 10:00 PM. Can this be extended? (Answer) The general business office of this bureau can receive billing telegrams from 8:30 AM to midnight every day. However, billing telegrams before 9:00 AM and after 10:00 PM are handled concurrently by on-duty telecommunications staff.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>On Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>I once said dogmatically: "It is a shortcoming to study art without understanding some Kunqu opera. Especially for those who study Chinese literature, if they have not read Kunqu opera, I think they are not qualified to talk about Chinese literature. For those who study music, dance, and drama, if they have not seen a performance of Kunqu opera, it is really their greatest loss."</p>
<p>The reason I consider myself "dogmatic" is because I only stated my conclusion in a general way without explaining my reasons in detail. Perhaps it is not only "dogmatic" but also somewhat contradictory, because I have always advocated new literature and opposed old literature. Kunqu opera is old literature, so why do I value it so highly?</p>
<p>However, I am neither dogmatic nor contradictory, and I can explain my reasons.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Chinese literature. Traditionally, only prose, parallel prose, poetry, and lyrics are considered literature, while novels and operas are not included. In particular, pedantic people simply regard the Four Books and Five Classics as literature, while novels and operas are absolutely excluded. Since Wang Guowei and others took a different view of Kunqu opera, many orthodox scholars have gained some understanding of it and given it some value. First, Kunqu opera occupies an important position in the history of Chinese literature. Each era has its own literary characteristics, and Kunqu opera is the characteristic of Yuan Dynasty literature, as well as the main supporting role of Ming and Qing Dynasty literature. A history of Chinese literature that does not pay attention to it, or that pays attention to it but fails to provide appropriate commentary, is incomplete. Second, Kunqu opera occupies an even more important position in Chinese literature. This can be proven by Wang Guowei's words on Yuan Dynasty opera. He said: "What is the beauty of Yuan Dynasty opera? In a word, it is naturalness! All great literature, ancient and modern, is superior in naturalness, and none more so than Yuan Dynasty opera." He also said: "The beauty of its writing can also be summed up in one word: intent! What is meant by intent? It means that when writing about emotions, it penetrates the heart and spleen; when writing about scenery, it is before the eyes and ears; when narrating events, it is as if they came from the mouth. Excellent ancient poetry and lyrics are all like this, and so is Yuan Dynasty opera." Third, Kunqu opera has an even more important relationship or influence on modern Chinese literature or new literature. We can see from it the traces of the evolution of Chinese literature and deduce that the emergence of modern new literature is an inevitable result, so that those who cling to the past and have a fondness for antiquity will make fewer meaningless objections. It can also let us know that the path that modern new literature should take is popularization, and its ultimate goal is to make the public artistic, because Kunqu opera is precisely popularized and aims to make the public artistic. Wang Guowei said: "In ancient literature, when describing things, ancient language was generally used, and there were hardly any uses of colloquial language; moreover, the number of words used was not very large. Only Yuan Dynasty opera, because it allowed the use of filler words, often used many colloquial expressions or described things with natural sounds. This is unprecedented in ancient literature." This is the explanation of Kunqu opera's relationship with the masses.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that those who have not read Kunqu opera are not qualified to talk about Chinese literature, and perhaps this can avoid the charge of dogmatism. Moreover, Kunqu opera is especially in line with the spirit of modern new literature, so my high regard for it may not necessarily contradict my advocacy of new literature! Originally, my opposition to old literature was only against those traditional old literatures, while old literatures with new spirits that coincided with modern new literature, I was in favor of. It is only because this kind of old literature, which can be called new, is very rare, and most of them are antique, affected, and utterly useless old literatures, that I often have to reject them in general. Moreover, Kunqu opera has always been looked down upon by orthodox literati and was not originally within the scope of orthodox literature. My opposition to old literature is only against orthodox literature, and Kunqu opera was originally not included. The reason why my words are neither dogmatic nor contradictory is because of these reasons, although I feel that I have not explained it in detail enough.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about music and other arts. What was called "comprehensive art" before the war is really appropriate and does not need much explanation. The most important thing about Kunqu opera is its performance. Kunqu opera may as well be called drama, and the solo singing of Kunqu opera can be regarded as poetry. In addition, ancient poetry also combined expression and dance, and originally had the same source as drama. Therefore, perhaps it can be said that drama and Kunqu opera are originally the same thing. When moved to the stage, it is drama; when placed on a desk to read, it is Kunqu opera. And opera becomes a mixed and reasonable name. Yuan Dynasty opera is Yuan Dynasty drama, and Ming and Qing Dynasty legends are now Kunqu operas and dramas, so there is no problem. Is Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasty opera Chinese doubt?</p>
<p>The singing and performance of Yuan Dynasty opera have mostly been lost. The singing and performance of Ming and Qing Dynasty legends, since Wei Liangfu of Kunshan in the Ming Dynasty first created the "water-grinding tune," became popular for a time, and the world followed it. Until now, the word "Kunqu opera" has become the representative name of Chinese opera, especially referring to its singing and performance. Therefore, Kunqu opera is the "comprehensive art" of China, and it is by no means an overstatement. Don't you believe it? Then you might as well go and see or listen.</p>
<p>However, if you have preconceived notions and think that it is just nonsense to watch and listen to Kunqu opera, then of course you will be incompatible with it. Even if you have no preconceived notions and do not have much understanding of art in general, you will gain nothing from watching and listening. Finally, if you have artistic cultivation but cannot correlate the art of Kunqu opera with the art you understand, then I say that your gains will be few. In my opinion, as someone who has no artistic cultivation and only a superficial understanding of Kunqu opera, the singing of Kunqu opera has its unique features.</p>
<p>The singing of Kunqu opera is a fusion of phonology, harmony, and composition. Its highs and lows, speed and slowness, are just right for the needs of us Orientals, especially Chinese people, to express various emotions. Although Kunqu opera has declined, Peking opera and various local operas have flourished, and their singing methods are mostly derived from Kunqu opera, but with simplification and ease. I am unwilling to say that Chinese music, especially singing, is completely useless compared to Western music. If there is still its due value and status, then we must respect the Kunqu opera, which is the culmination of all.</p>
<p>Among the accompanying musical instruments in music, Chinese gongs, drums, and stringed and wind instruments will always be immortal. And the best tunes or combinations of these instruments, no matter when or where you hear them, are all preserved in Kunqu opera.</p>
<p>Dance in art also occupies an important position in drama, because it can represent the actions of the singers and performers. The actions of the singers and performers, even in the most recently popular spoken drama, are by no means our casual daily actions. They always have some rhythm and conform to the melody of the music, similar to dance. This is known to everyone. Opera must have dance. I say that all kinds of inherent Chinese dances are also preserved in Kunqu opera. A single gesture or step in Peking opera often wins loud cheers from the audience, but who knows that in "Kunqu opera" (this is an untenable name, commonly used in relation to Peking opera), the "sound" and the body movements, every word and every expression, are all dance from beginning to end! One person singing is a solo dance, two people singing is a duet, a confrontation dance, and many people singing is a group dance, a collective dance. To look at the actions of Kunqu opera with the eyes of dance is to understand it. Even the fighting scenes, which are the most misunderstood or opposed, are actually just a kind of dance. Although the fighting scenes in Kunqu opera are not as fiery and tense as in Peking opera, their beauty and elegance are undeniable.</p>
<p>The various positions taken during dance, especially during fighting and group dances, are also very good patterns in art. From patterns to painting, then, the various costumes and decorations of the singers and performers, based on their centuries of experience, gradually improved by removing the dross and keeping the essence, have reached the point of perfection today. Don't underestimate the facial makeup, thinking that it is just a vestige of barbarian tattooing. In fact, it is also a noble art. All in all, Kunqu opera initiated various kinds of dramatic techniques, and even now, the most beautiful, elegant, and appropriate conditions are still preserved in Kunqu opera.</p>
<p>The various elements in drama, which are in line with the various elements in art, such as posture being in line with sculpture, do not need to be discussed. In other words, the various elements in Kunqu opera, which are in line with the various elements in art, do not need much further explanation.</p>
<p>The study of art, the study of music, dance, and so on, should originally start with the modern, and its ultimate goal should be to create new things. But new things cannot be born without roots, and especially cannot be copied entirely from the West. The old, especially this Kunqu opera, can make many contributions to the new. I wonder why you are unwilling to take a look at it? Isn't this the greatest loss? By taking a look at it, we can appreciate it more and add noble and proper entertainment to life. It seems that we have no reason to ignore Kunqu opera.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that by giving up the opportunity to study or learn various arts and to watch Kunqu opera performances, I am suffering the greatest loss. Is this not dogmatic? And I am also strongly advocating new art. Now, I only advocate that this kind of old art, the singing and performance of Kunqu opera, needs to be preserved, referenced, and appreciated. Is this also not contradictory?</p>
<p>Then, Kunqu opera today, whether it is the Kunqu opera on the desk or the singing and performance on the stage, we can regard it as follows: preserve it, refer to it, and appreciate it, because it has its own undeniable value! As long as we are not poisoned by the ideas it leaves behind, such as traditional feudal consciousness and superstition, then it will be fine!</p>
<p>(Postscript: On September 13th and 14th, there will be two large-scale joint performances by Kunqu opera amateurs at the Lyceum Theatre. The purpose is to raise scholarship funds for Soochow University. Those who love Kunqu opera or want to see what "Kunqu opera" is all about may wish to use it as a reference to this article.)</p>
<h3>Lakeside Night</h3>
<p>— Pei Yin</p>
<p>That night, there was no moon, no stars.</p>
<p>I stepped out of my house, walked through the alley, and came to the street. After passing through streets with colorful neon lights, I arrived at the quiet lakeside. The park by the lake appeared dim, floating with some mysterious air.</p>
<p>I strolled peacefully, following the path along the lake.</p>
<p>On the green painted wooden benches with backs placed along the lake, couples were leaning against each other. Some who arrived late sat on the soft grass. They talked in low, affectionate tones, and their various intimate attitudes revealed their mutual passion.</p>
<p>Let the darkness cover their shame; the darkness made them bold...</p>
<p>The lakeside at night is a paradise for lovers.</p>
<h3>Ma Liuquan's Lament for Selling His Son</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Ma Liuquan's lament for selling his son: "Poor families also cherish their children, How can one bear to abandon the heavy bond of flesh and blood? Unable to ensure survival from hunger and cold, I sell my son into servitude. When will we meet again after this separation? I caress my son's body and lick his face, If fate allows, I will redeem him in a year of abundance, If not, I will embrace eternal resentment in the nine springs. I implore my son not to worry about his parents, Worrying will make you sick, who will take care of you? Holding each other's heads and stamping their feet, their cries were cut off, The mournful wind whistled, the sky was vast and hazy." This work is very much in the style of the old Du Fu.</p>
<h3>Literary Men's Love for Cats</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>——From Miscellany in a Violet Box</p>
<p>The cat is the most docile domestic animal, and also a wonderful ornament in the family. People in the old days regarded it as a good companion, not only for catching mice. My family originally had a tortoiseshell cat, which we had kept for three years. It was good at catching mice, did not steal food, and had a fixed place to relieve itself, so the whole family loved it. Unexpectedly, it has changed recently. It is lazy all day long, often dozing on the stove, stealing food when it sees it, and no longer relieves itself in a fixed place. It also often scratches the carpets and chair cushions with its paws, which makes me very hate it, but there is nothing I can do. Unexpectedly, I found it dead in the garden the day before yesterday morning. I don't know how it died. Fortunately, it has given birth to two kittens, so it is not extinct, and I have no worries about the future. We gave away one and kept one. Its fur is yellowish-red with deep black, and its abdomen and four feet are all white. It is more beautiful than its mother and can be considered a captivating creature.</p>
<p>Most Chinese literati and men of letters love cats, so there are often poems and lyrics praising them. Qian Baofen, a Qing Dynasty lyricist, wrote a poem about a cat called "Snow Lion Cub" and solicited rhymes from his fellow lyricists. Famous people such as Zhu Zhuyi, Wu Guren, and Li Fanxie all responded. Zhu's three lyrics are elegant and graceful and can be called a connoisseur of cats. The first one says: "How many ounces of Wu salt? To hire a cat, when bathing silkworms. The silk ribbon is traceless, kneading fluff into a mound. The poet Huang Jiu, also does not hesitate to buy fish and thread willows. He especially loves to live beside the hibiscus and peony flowers. A clear painting after the midday dream returns. Contracting its double eyes, it suddenly stands up, drowsy and still. Surprised, it leaps onto the rattan stool, mother and child holding each other for a long time. Will the parrot come? Arousing several embroideries paused in the spring boudoir. Heavy curtains tempt. Please warm your hands by the stove again. " The second one says: "Better than butter entering snow, who in front of people, does not call you ungrateful? All day long, on the heavy steps, constantly teaching the young ones secretly. Foolish children and silly girls, do not pull the colorful silk reins. Let it eat fish and catch sparrows, watch bees and spy on mice. It can cross a hundred-foot red wall. Asking Tan, thanking Yuan, where do you sleep in spring? Beside the golden embroidered shoes, its twin pupils are always focused. The jade beauty turns her steps. You must listen carefully to the attentive instructions. Empty room curtains, do not mistake the cicada." The third one says: "Grinding its teeth and licking, resembling a tiger, its yellow eyes and whiskers are distinguishable. The hot weather is long, test the coolness of its nose. Incense ash is dark. It cannot catch even a single cricket. Further searching towards the purple mustard under the fence, the red amaranth on the stone ridge. Drunk, the lotus root trembles frequently. Surprised to scratch its head and pass its ear, the eternal mark is initially cleansed. The news of the husband's return, do not break it with a jade whip. Spreading throughout Pingling. Asking who fastened the golden coin lock? The wind turns. Canyon butterflies are startled and fly in confusion."</p>
<p>Not only Chinese literati love cats, but also many famous figures in the Western literary world have a cat obsession. For example, the French literary giant Victor Hugo would feel depressed and lost if he did not see his beloved cat in the room. The novelist François Coppée loved cats to the point of being obsessed, and he spared no effort in collecting famous breeds year after year. He had several Persian cats, which were extremely valuable. The novelist Théophile Gautier also kept many cats, loving them all. He gave them Eastern names, such as Chabi Deb, Zobeidah, etc. One female cat was named after the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. Another cat, the most beautiful one, had a red nose and blue eyes. He loved it the most and always took it with him wherever he went. He called it Mrs. Ciphil, as Ciphil was his own name. He simply treated it like a beloved wife. In the English literary world, there were also several famous figures who loved cats, such as the novelist and poet Walter Scott. He was originally obsessed with dogs and did not love cats, but in his later years, he underwent a change and developed a great fondness for cats. He wrote in his articles: "The greatest progress I have made in age is discovering that I love a cat, a creature that I originally hated." The poet William Cowper always had his beloved kitten by his side when he was at home. He wrote to a friend: "This is the most sensitive animal covered in cat skin." Other famous writers such as Samuel Johnson, Oliver Madox Brown, and Horace Walpole were also famous cat lovers, who were friends with cats on a daily basis and were unhappy without them.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"You're calling that 'deliberate ignorance' ... You child, ... alas!" Yaoqun sighed.</p>
<p>"Don't you readily have many foreign medicinal powders? Using them is both convenient and doesn't harm people ... Why do you need this thing?"</p>
<p>"Isn't this thing very durable?" Yaoqun's face immediately took on a layer of sadness, like faded flower petals.</p>
<p>"No, Aunt Ji ...!" Little Tiger opened his bright eyes wide, imitating an adult's attitude, preparing to argue with Yaoqun: "Durable? As long as this thing is used on your hands or body, I remember Grandpa Qiu said that as long as it's used once, it not only changes color, but also causes fire boils for a lifetime - extremely poisonous! ..."</p>
<p>Yaoqun suddenly shed a few tears.</p>
<p>Grandpa Qiu was an old-timer in the village, with a belly full of the Three Teachings and Nine Streams, and a belly full of bizarre anecdotes. When chatting idly, he told the story of a young lady escaping from disaster; this young lady was as beautiful as Chang'e in the moon. Fearing that the long-haired rebels would notice her, she used "mao cao gen" (a type of grass root) to boil water for bathing, ruining her beautiful appearance. After washing her snow-white skin with this poisonous grass, it turned scorched yellow and swollen, and she had fire boils constantly for years. Yaoqun, out of curiosity, remembered the name of this grass, and fearing that Grandpa Qiu was just joking, she secretly asked him again. Grandpa Qiu took out the Compendium of Materia Medica to verify his story. Little Tiger probably remembered this story when he bought the medicine back.</p>
<p>Why did Yaoqun need to disguise herself? She had new-style disguise skills, why resort to using this poisonous grass? Having decided to do so, why was she so sad and shedding tears?</p>
<p>Yaoqun herself had said that spies rely on disguise, which shows that they are not capable; unless they meet two conditions: First, they want to impersonate someone and infiltrate that person's social circle to obtain secrets. Second, their own appearance has been recognized by a certain social organization, and they also know their duties and goals, but due to certain relationships, they have to personally participate in this society or organization to obtain secrets. Apart from disguise, there is no other way to achieve their goal; only then do they need to change their appearance.</p>
<p>However, Yaoqun's work at this time did not seem to fall within these two conditions. So, why did she need to disguise herself, or even disfigure herself?</p>
<h3>America is Feeding the "Japanese Tiger"</h3>
<p>— Authored by David Conde, Translated by Zhengming</p>
<p>Editor's Note: MacArthur's "Victory Day" address was full of praise for the current state of Japan; and he said that a lenient policy should be adopted for the peace treaty with Japan. However, Japan still retains the soul of militarism. MacArthur's views are a major concern for China and the world.</p>
<p>This article offers a stern critique of MacArthur's current policies, and may serve as a reference for the current "peace treaty with Japan."</p>
<p>It should be clear to everyone now that the United States has changed its original policy toward Japan. Observers in Tokyo saw this about-face happening as early as April 1946, but the implications of this reversal for peace in Asia have only become clear now.</p>
<p>In the initial months, the original policy guiding the occupation forces was perhaps the last evidence in the Pacific of Roosevelt's New Deal confronting a defeated aggressor with a hard-line approach. The joint guidance of the U.S. State Department, War Department, and Navy Department in September 1945 had planned to permanently eliminate Japan's threat to its neighbors and the world.</p>
<p>This could only be accomplished by eliminating Japan's military forces, stripping warlords and proponents of aggression of their power, ending the stranglehold exercised by monopolistic giants to prevent them from becoming the economic and industrial machinery for launching wars again, and allowing the Japanese people political freedom so that they could establish a government of their own choosing.</p>
<p>Any sovereign nation has the right to change its policies at any time, and any supreme commander has the right to urge changes to such policies whenever he deems it necessary.</p>
<p>If people or nations are persuaded or encouraged to believe that the original U.S. policy toward Japan has been implemented, then this is not only a big mistake, but also a dangerous thing for all the people living in the Pacific basin.</p>
<p>Japan remains the strongest industrial power in Asia. Japan's economy has not been democratized, and the Japanese people have not achieved effective political democracy, capable of wielding any significant control over Japan's vast war-making potential.</p>
<p>Airfields and military installations still dot the Japanese countryside. Fortifications and obstacles have not yet been demolished. Even the flatlands upon which these fortifications and defenses were built have not been converted into much-needed farmland.</p>
<p>Underground caves used as shelters for factories and military command posts during the war can still be seen from Kyushu to Hokkaido, which seems highly inappropriate in a land that has implemented a new democratic constitution and has forever vowed to renounce war.</p>
<p>Apart from the vast demobilization bureau, Japan's navy, army, and air force have been demobilized, and almost all military weapons have been destroyed. However, Japan still retains every necessary element to create a great war machine. The only thing missing is raw materials.</p>
<p>"Anti-Communist Bulwark"</p>
<p>Since General MacArthur has given Japan the role of an "anti-communist bulwark" in Asia, the issue of raw materials will not remain a problem for long. A "bulwark," if it is to have any value, must be strong economically and militarily. It must be given loans and technical assistance to play a key role. Japan must be guaranteed areas for doing business to earn money to pay for imports and support its population. If the former colonies cannot be returned, then it must be guaranteed access to raw materials.</p>
<p>While reparations goods are being removed from Japan, she is still able to maintain steel, chemical, and shipbuilding industries, and Japan still retains a skilled labor force.</p>
<p>Recently, someone asked MacArthur how Japan could "protect" itself after the occupying forces withdrew. He replied, "One way is to backtrack and allow them to have a small military establishment," although he felt that the United States should take on this task on their behalf.</p>
<p>Such a policy could only be considered meaningful if Japan were a democratic country, if the Japanese people had some significant control over their own destiny, and if there were some evidence to guarantee that Japanese leaders would never exploit Japan's key position to play great power politics among the three major powers—China, the United States, and the Soviet Union—using the familiar method of pitting barbarians against barbarians to once again dominate Asia.</p>
<p>However, there is no such guarantee.</p>
<p>Repeating Historical Mistakes</p>
<p>General MacArthur undoubtedly feels he has many legitimate reasons to explain his change in attitude toward Japan. He has changed from a policy of completely demilitarizing Japan and fully democratizing it economically to a policy of turning Japan into an "anti-communist bulwark" and helping it achieve economic recovery.</p>
<p>Isn't the same mistake made with Germany after World War I now being repeated with Japan? Many thoughtful observers believe that the United States is doing exactly this foolish thing. (Translated from the Millard's Review)</p>
<h3>Thoughts on a Letter from Tokyo</h3>
<p>It seems like a serendipitous encounter. Today, I received a postcard from Tokyo, sent by a Japanese friend. As I gazed at the postcard, the following thoughts arose, which I would like to share with the readers of "Free Talk":</p>
<p>(1) Currently, the peace treaty with Japan has not been concluded, and Sino-Japanese transportation has not resumed. It is said that Japan can directly send letters to China, by American ships or airplanes, but China cannot directly communicate with Japan by mail, except for official channels, of course.</p>
<p>(2) The postcard had a total of fifty sen worth of postage stamps. In addition to the fifteen sen printed on the card, the sender affixed one fifteen-sen stamp and two ten-sen stamps. The fifteen-sen stamp features a portrait of General MacArthur, which shows that the Japanese indeed revere MacArthur as a "holy general," which is not wrong at all. The two ten-sen stamps boldly bear the words "Great Japanese Empire Postal Service," which demonstrates that Japan's "democratization" and MacArthur's "spiritual revolution" are completely hypocritical.</p>
<p>(3) The postcard refers to China as "Shina," which indicates that the Japanese cultural elite still hold the "Shina view" of China, and the views of other people can be imagined.</p>
<p>Originally, this was a small matter, but it allows us to truly understand Japan today.</p>
<h3>Thrift</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>The sound of thrift echoes on the Shanghai Bund,</p>
<p>The opera and dance halls moan in misery;</p>
<p>Not to curb extravagance by imposing levies,</p>
<p>But to make the gentry set an example themselves!</p>
<p>The newspaper reports that Article 7 of the "Outline for the Implementation of Measures for Thrifty Consumption" states that "Entertainment venues are limited to closing at 11 PM." This city has implemented it starting from the third day, but the theaters in this city have no shows, and 11 PM is the time when attendance is at its peak. Now that the order is to close early, the owners of general opera and dance halls are all "groaning in misery." In fact, they are subject to "limited expenses" in terms of time, but cannot truly achieve savings in material terms. How can they "shift the trend of extravagance?" But looking back at the gentry, their "pride, luxury, licentiousness, and dissipation" are a hundred or a thousand times greater than the consumption of ordinary people. Therefore, if we want to "implement thrift," it would be more practical to start with the "gentry setting an example themselves," which would be much more beneficial.</p>
<h3>Love Imperfection</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei</p>
<p>The Louvre in Paris houses Rodin's sculptures. The "Venus de Milo" is one of the most famous sculptures in the world. However, to us Chinese, who love complete and happy endings, this is truly an imperfection. Why should such a beautiful woman be missing an arm? Although we all love completeness, fate has destined that mankind cannot have completeness. We often see that a family has a good wife, but the husband is not good; a husband with a good temper, but the wife is terribly fierce. The father is a successful and established great man, but the son is often a spendthrift. The poor were originally rich, and the rich of today will be the poor of tomorrow. Some people do not like to watch tragedies because tragedies are imperfections in life, but tragedies are constantly being performed. Marguerite wanted to live and die with her lover, but as a result, she sacrificed herself for another kind of love, causing herself to die in a state of imperfection. Imperfection is indeed a sad thing. For example, if a person wears a beautiful and clean white suit, and someone drips a drop of oil on their clothes, that oil stain is an unspeakable imperfection. People live in imperfection. If people want to live, they must get used to imperfection. The moon cannot always be full. It is only in darkness that we know the beauty of light. Without darkness, how would we know the preciousness of light? If people are content with imperfection, then imperfection becomes perfection. Those who do not grieve do not know the taste of happiness. Everything cannot and will not last forever. Although the "Sacred Tree" (note) of Alishan has lived for three thousand years, I dare say that it cannot live forever. Although three thousand years is long enough, time is even longer than that, and it cannot avoid being destroyed along with time. We should love imperfection, love everything, for there is nothing in the world that is not lovable. (36, 8, 25, in Qingdao)</p>
<p>(Note) There is a tree on Alishan in Taiwan that the Japanese call the Sacred Tree. It has a circumference of 32 meters and has lived for three thousand years, making it the second oldest tree in the world.</p>
<p>Announcement: Summer vacation has passed quickly, and schools (while arguing about the amount of tuition fees and training fees) are about to open again.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, this journal will collect several articles on the issue of tuition fees, which can also be considered as a welcome address for the opening of various schools. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on a Trip to America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shu</p>
<p>American Private Military Schools</p>
<p>The United States is only a newly emerging country of over a hundred years. In terms of seniority, it is our great-grandson three thousand generations removed. However, their education, industry, economy, and everything else are above us. Even military science, which has been fighting internal wars for two thousand years since the Warring States period, must seek advice from this younger generation. It's not that we're backward, it's just that they've progressed too quickly. A reader who gloriously resisted Japan wants to go to the United States to receive military education, but has no idea where to start in choosing a school. I think this is something worth discussing publicly. Military education in the United States is divided into formal and informal. Formal schools include West Point, Virginia Military Academy, Staff School, and various specialized schools of the military. Before the war, except for "West Point," these schools did not accept foreign students, and "West Point" only accepted students sent by the Chinese government, limited to two students per term. Wang Geng was a veteran student of "West Point," and I heard that Wen Yingxing was also a graduate of West Point. Graduates from previous terms were usually sent to the United States for military training. However, due to the "West Point" requirement of two students per term, they all entered other private military schools to complete their studies. Therefore, most of the military veterans who have studied in the United States in our country are graduates of private military schools, while West Point graduates are truly rare. Private military schools are at the high school level and aim to train reserve officers. They are located everywhere, numbering in the thousands. Enrollment is not necessarily restricted. Local newspapers publish advertisements openly recruiting students. Tuition and accommodation fees are more expensive than ordinary high schools, and most of the students are from wealthy families. The cost of a set of military uniform is always around one hundred US dollars, and the students of these schools are generally splendidly dressed in military uniforms (with gold thread), with swords gleaming (command swords), and extraordinarily heroic, still retaining the vestiges of the British Guards. During the study period, students have official ranks, from private to colonel, and their official ranks are also prominently printed on their business cards. Therefore, there is no need to be surprised to encounter a fourteen or fifteen-year-old colonel on the road, and it is by no means impersonating a military officer. However, after graduating and entering a formal military school for training, their rank is still that of a private, but after completing the training period, they are promoted to formal officers. Even if they do not pass the graduation exam, they still retain the qualification of reserve officers. All universities in the United States have a Department of Military Sciences, with courses focusing on military technology, such as surveying and mapping, military communications, espionage and counter-espionage, foreign languages, and horsemanship. The instructors are mostly active or reserve senior officers, with colonels, major generals, and lieutenant generals undertaking the training work. The aviation departments of some universities have their own airplanes and airfields. The scope is comparable to any military flying school. The aviation departments in these universities are the main bases for training civil aviation personnel, and also the source for replenishing military aviation personnel. Therefore, once a foreign war breaks out, the government can mobilize millions of well-trained elite soldiers without much effort. One characteristic of American soldiers is that they are scholarly, as most of them come from the doors of universities. After demobilization, they can all obtain better positions in society. As for those who lose their jobs due to the armistice and file lawsuits, it is like looking for a needle in a haystack. (4)(9)</p>
