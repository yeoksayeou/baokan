<p>〔中央社瀋陽二日電〕陳明仁將軍二日對中外記者團報吿四平守城經過，歷一小時，略稱：四平自五月廿一日起即陷於共軍重國，當即在東南髙地一帶發生激戰，我軍沉着固守，共軍迭攻不逞，乃沿中長綫南犯，六月十一日，共軍再窺四平，集中十二個師，四個旅，一個砲兵師之兵力，向我飛機塲一帶猛攻。十四日黄昏，共軍集中砲火向市區及四周陣地轟擊砲彈達二萬餘發，夜由西南角突入市區，蔓延甚烈，我守軍當與其展開激烈巷戰，襲方傷亡均大，共軍竞以屍體構成肉陣，殘暴行爲，駭人聽聞。十五日夜，共軍企圖在西南角開闢第二缺口，涇我軍奮勇迎擊，共匪遺屍千餘後退。廿一日起，共軍复向道東突入，不惜任何犧牲，向前猛撲，蓋企圖在我援軍未到以前，解決四平戰局，我軍則固守據點，堅決抵抗，一墻一屋，皆爲必爭之地。廿四日，道東之中興糧棧及酒精工廠相繼失守。廿八日共軍又增援第十八師，澈夜猛攻，終未得逞。廿九日，共軍知援軍即到，大勢已去，但仍圖作最後戰，我以全力反擊，共軍傷亡慘重，向西潰退，我軍乃於卅日拂曉出擊，掃除殘敵，收復道西市街及飛機塲。陳將軍稱：此次共軍發砲共十萬發，傷亡總數在五萬人以上，俘二千餘人，內日韓人均有輕機槍千餘挺，重機槍百餘挺，其他彈藥武器無算。</p>

<p>（一）劫後四平現仍在黑烟能罩中，大豆燃燒，火光熊熊，手榴彈與槍聲，此伏彼起，戰事停後，軍民淸掃戰塲，死屍埋不勝埋。</p>

<p>〔中央社天津二日電〕七月一日有來自滄縣之共軍斡部王民强，向此間警局自首，彼於出發來津前，曾被共軍逼令其殺斃其祖母，以表忠誠。彼自首時稱，渠於共軍進攻滄縣時，担任該縣小南門之指揮官，因不忍故鄉父老死於砲火，未積極作戰，會一度被扣押。近復被派來津，組織人民福利社，以從事情報工作，被迫親手斃殺其祖母時，即出發來津之前夕。抵津後，鑒於共軍之暴虐，乃自行投誠，以贖前愆。</p>
<h3>經委會全體審查會　討論經濟改革案　六次會改期今繼續審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕全國經濟委員會於二日下午三時舉行全體審査會，審查張院長所提「經濟改革方案」，歷四小時，對發揮人力，增加生產，增產物資，穩定物價等點，咸作熱烈辯論，三日將再開審査會。至原定三日舉行之經委會第六次會，則改期舉行。</p>
<p>二日審査會由徐堪主席，討論農貸，工貸及出口商貸款時，辯論甚烈。根據原提案，此類貸款以大量與普遍為原則，期能促進米。麥。棉。豆及麫粉。紗布。油·糖·燃料等之生產，並運用其一部份討論結果，予以修正，蓋目前而談大量普遍貸款，實非國家財力所能勝任，且有引起通貨膨脹危險。陳立夫說明時，認此類貸款，不致引起通貨膨脹，蓋貸款後，足以增加生產，且他日還款時，以實物繳付，此爲方案中重要之點，以維持原案爲宜，其他委員則認爲此一辦法有下列弊端：（一）生產未增，先發生惡性膨脹，（二）狡黠商人利用貸款，從事其他投機，（三）還款時故意延宕，或以劣品繳付。</p>
<p>對工農貸款決予以限制</p>
<p>辯論結果，將來貸款以有條件，部份的及限制的為原則。會中討論政府以民生日用必需品對官兵、公敎人負及生產工廠工人先作有計劇之供應與配售問題時，陳立夫說明供應不致發生困難，其他委員則認時間上恐來不及，結果予以修正，決先供應物價較高，公務員較多之城市。關於穩定幣值問題，根據原方案共有三項辦法：（一）迅速處理無須國家經營之企業，出售敵偽產業及剩餘物資，並整理稅收，以謀在短期內彌補財政之不足，防止通貨膨脹。（二）政府應有充分準備，並選擇適當時機，以整理幣制，期能逐漸恢復常態。（三）東北，台灣，新疆三地之幣制，須同時整理，使爲一致。會中據此曾加討論。繼又商議改革金融制度，根據原方案金融制度之改革，必須特別注意爲國家經濟政策服務，以增加農工生產爲主要目的，金融機構應各有主要之專門業務，並決定以縣爲金融制度之基層機構，扶植縣銀行之設立，以便利建設並配合地方自治之推行。縣銀行以每縣一行為原則，陳立夫說明後，潘序倫等加以反對，認為若照方案辦法，縣銀行將多至二千餘家。無乃太多，會中提出三種修正意見：（一）由農行及合作金庫，在必要地點設分支行庫。（二）由省銀行於重要地區設分行。（三）設縣銀行後，將省銀行取消。此三種意見，會中並未通過，會議至下午七時半始散。三日將再開審査會，繼續討論。又二日審查會中一部份委員認經濟改革方案包括過多，牽涉過貿，不若選擇迫切易行者，先予舉辦。</p>
<h3>中政會討論軍事外交　慰勉四平各部隊　新疆事件促提二次抗議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕中央政治委員會二日晨九時舉行第七次會議，戴傳賢生席，陳誠，王世杰作軍事外交報吿，各委員於聽取報吿後，當即決定（一）堅守四平之陳明仁軍長所部及增援會師解圍之各部隊，捨死忘生，奮力血戰，殊堪嘉尙，決致電慰勉。（二）北塔山事件，蘇方覆文與事實不符，應由外部提出第二次抗議，說明北塔山乃我國之領土。陳誠之軍事報吿，着重四平之戰，渠稱；四平之捷，使東北軍事形勢好轉，士氣大振，然因共軍曾將外圍各縣糧食刦掠而去，我方軍政配合又欠週密，故給養方面不無困難。就剿共軍事全面形勢言，東北戰事之外，重點在山東，如魯中方面再獲決定性之勝利，整個局勢當更好轉。王世杰之外交報吿，曾詳細分析國際局勢，尤着重於美國對外政策之決定，因美正從事國內資源之調査，俾用以援助歐陸，救濟東亞。過去似着重歐洲，但以最近解除軍火禁運令一事觀之，似已兼重東亞，吾人希望美國於八月外長會議舉行之前，能有明確之計劃及表示。關於新疆事件，王氏亦續作報吿。中政會內政，外交，軍事三小組所提報吿書，同時提出討諭，報吿書中說明新疆地理，北塔山屬於新疆，盛世才主新時，曾在阿山區設採金局，該局聘有蘇籍噸問，如北塔山非新省所屬，新省自不能在該區設局採金，此理至明。會中當決定提二次抗議，交有關機關執行。</p>
<p>責成負責方面暢運東北物資</p>
<p>關於東北資源問題，各委員對東北經委會多所質難，咸以東北資源煤及大豆產量甚豐，過去蘇軍及共軍曾槍運出口，提取外匯，而我欲運出即感困難，豐富產物廢棄於地，實屬可惜，此應責成負責方面査明責任盡量暢運。會中並通過人事調動案兩件，（一）中央公務員懲戒委會委員長內定翁敬棠出任，（二）地政部政次鄭震宇辭職照准，內定由現任常次湯惠蓀遞補，常次人選朱定，以上人事調動，將提國務會議討論。至職業團體立委名額問題，二日再度提出，各委員多主恢復國務會議前通過之一一二名之數額，立院前決議爲八四名，此乃建議性質，決定權仍在國務會議，應於國務會中提出，請維原議，按照一一二名通過。</p>
<h3>張君勱謁主席提供時局意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕民社黨領袖張君勱，應蔣主席邀，二日晨七時自滬抵京，午應張羣宴，席間會就一設局勢，有所商談。下午五時晋謁主席，張氏對地方政治之改革，民生經濟之安定等，提供意見甚多。張認爲當前時局問題，最要者仍在改良地方政治，不必特別注意討伐令？張於下午十一時即離京返滬。</p>
<h3>政院預算審查會通過追加預算案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕行政院預算審査委會二日下午三時舉行。王雲五主席，審査並通過交通部·敎育部，各追加預算案多件。交部追加預算案爲整修湘黔桂路，浙贛路，粤漢路之經費。</p>

<p>〔本報北平二日電〕司使二日晨九時冒雨飛京，傅涇波仍留平，大使六日即返平。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕司使二日下午自平飛返京。</p>
<h3>立院將休會兩月</h3>
<p>今例會討論各項積案</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕立院定三日開三三一次例會，重要議案有立委職代名額分配表，婦女團體國大代表分配表，選舉舞弊懲罰條例，修正在華美軍人員刑事案件條例等案，一俟各案討論完畢，即休會兩月，如三日仍朱能竣事，四日將續開會。</p>
<h3>蘇遣僑民歸國已通知我政府</h3>
<p>外部發言人答記者問</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕政院新聞局二日記者招待會中，有詢以蘇職決將居留中國谷大城市之三千戶蘇僑遣返本國，中國政府認爲此舉之重要性如何？經外部發善人答稱，若干時前，蘇政府曾自東北遣回俄僑一批，此事諸君必能憶及。此次蘇聯政府擬再運回一批，包括一百五十名左右之孤兒在內。蘇政府曾以此意通知我政府，我政府自將對志願回蘇之俄僑，予以必需之便利。</p>
<p>〔本報天津二日電〕津蘇副領事多若非也夫宣稱，津蘇領館已自南京大使館轉到關於遣返平·津·滬蘇僑之命令。渠解釋遣返蘇僑之理由，謂係由於多數蘇僑失業，政府茲決定於國內代爲安挿工作。</p>
<h3>平市一部白俄願意歸化我國</h3>
<p>蘇領館辦理白俄復籍</p>

<h3>不顧數千萬人生命財產　共軍阻撓黃河修防　魯復堤員工撤退情勢嚴重</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕中共破壞修防黄河協定之行動，業經此間當局證實。頃據水利部接獲報吿稱：六月三十日夜，共軍劉伯誠部，潛行渡河，約有兩萬餘人，三十日午後，黃口以下北岸共軍，已普遍渡河，情形嚴重，臨濮集以東工段均被竊據，魯修防處臨　曹州員工，於三十日晨分批撤退至荷澤，該處孔主任率員工六十人，携重要文件抵汴。朱口，仲固堆，亦無法施工，該處尙有員工百餘人，未及後撤。六月二十九日，共軍由鉅野，東平，竄至新縣，郵城東北一帶，約數千人，各民垸開始戒嚴，仲固堆等地員工，已聯繫斷絕，臨濮以東工程，無法進行，朱口董莊段工程，亦大受影響，國軍正剿擊防堵中。劉伯誠部主力。現集結淮縣，范縣對岸。冀省境劉莊北岸共軍哨崗，不時發搶，二十九日上午第二石壩員工，正在工作時，被連續射擊，下午員工騐收材料時，又遭射擊，各員工正拚命冒險工作中。七月一日晨，臨淮集段之董莊工程員工，受共軍襲擊，已撤退至曹州。據稱：共軍已至黃口·臨淮·荷澤間公路側面，已有共軍踪跡。因此，黄河修防工作，已完全受阻，而六月廿一日在荷澤所商妥之協定，亦被撕毁。該協定中曾規定雙方復堤員工，不得作軍事政治等活動，並保證雙方員工安全，不意共軍竟一面佯作商談，一面潛派大軍渡河竄擾，沿河數千萬人民生命財產，今年勢必遭受重大損失矣</p>

<h3>全國輪船業公會聯合會開幕</h3>
<p>抗戰八年，海口完全淪陷，各業損失的重大，自以航業爲首屈一指。據估計，損失的總數，達三十萬噸，其中民營的，占到百分之九十。</p>
<p>勝利之初，所剩下來的輪舶不過十萬噸，迄今未到兩年，據間已增加到八十萬噸，其中有各公司新置的，有由盡軍贈與的，有向外洋購買的，亦有向國內的洋商講買的，而以向敵僞接收的，居其多數。今姑不問其來源如何，而以短短的期間內，整理擴充，急起直追，除恢復舊觀之外，現有噸數，還居然超過戰前原有之上，這不能不說是一個奇蹟。在戰後各種經濟建設中，類似的復興事業，恐怕還不易多見吧！</p>
<p>話雖如此，現在日本所有的商船。據說：還有一百五十萬噸，英國積極造船，其總噸數，已將近二千萬噸，而美國已擴充到六千萬噸以上，拿我們現在所有的輪船總噸數來比較。眞正是渺乎其小。况且半數以上的船舶，多是二十噸至二百噸以上的，只可行駛內河航綫，及在碼頭附近，作爲駁貨之用。其三千噸至五千噸以上的僅居少數。所以依上海爲起點的航綫，現在雖有（一）南洋綫，（二）北洋綫，（三）長江綫，（四）遠洋航綫等四條，而實際遝止限於前列三綫，其第四綫包括上海至朝鮮，日本，南洋，歐洲，美洲的究竟何時方能實現，還待準備籌擬之中。大約在美國的剩餘船舶，如自由，勝利兩類實行讓渡以前，事實上的可能性還很少。而且去年九月間，交通部曾頒佈准許輪船業雇用外人辦法，並規定中外員額比例，在沿海近海，不超過三分之一，遠洋不超過二分之一，可見目前人才的缺乏，又在去年十月間，頒佈航商購買舊船最低標準，規定：客船船齡，不得超過廿五齡，貨船不得超過廿八齡，吃水須在十八呎以內，速率須在十海哩以上，燃料須以煤爲主，更可見交部對於現有的船舶，還未能認爲完全滿意。</p>
<p>原來勝利以後，因航運上需要的迫切，航業的利潤，相當可觀。雖在軍運公運的負擔之下，而經過若干月的營運，所有購買的船本，卽不難完全賺回來。其共同組織的濟運組，所承受的救濟物資，共運費也須加以折扣的，但仍可勉維成本。其所以　復得如此迅速，其原因或卽在此，而設備上尙須力求完善，管理上尙須更求刷新，以及員工的訓練，保險救護的增進等，有待於航業界共同努力的，究竟還不在少數。</p>
<p>因為上述這種種緣故，在幾個月前，上海輪船業公會曾通函各地同業，發起組織全國輸船商業同業公會聯合會，以期集中力量，共謀改進，此項提議業已獲得各地普遍的同情，於今日在滬召開大會，正式成立。此舉的意義，確極重大。因爲交通的兩大動脈，爲鐵道與輪船。値此內亂未平，陸路運輸，動遭阻礙，所賴以貫通南北，維護客運，貨運與軍運的，端賴航運這一件有力的工具。故航業的盛衰，不應單視爲當業利害之所係，而實爲整個的國民經濟命脈之所關。</p>
<p>現在日本賠償的船船問題，愈益泊切，而美國剩餘船舶的移誕，亦將次成熟，這些任務，異常重大，斷非一手一足之力所能濟事。據上海輪船業公會李秘書長雲良所談：我國航業，明年可達一百五十萬噸，後年不難達到三百萬噸。這付重祖，顯然需要全國有關人士來共同肩荷。故全國輪船業聯合會之成立，在目前尤具有特殊的意義。自日本投降，不平等條約分別廢除，我國航運界活動的範圍擴大了，他們所負的責任，却也同時加重了。怎樣擴充範圍，推擴業務，以應今後實際上的需要，和怎樣鞏固航權，利用外來的船舶，以充實國內外的航綫，這是聯合會當前最大的課題。</p>

<h3>會商法折衷方案無結果　三外長會議失敗　莫洛托夫今日返莫斯科　皮杜爾或將飛英商西歐復興計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎二日廣播：三外長會議於今日五時五十分宣吿閉幕，法方所提折衷方案。未爲蘇方接受，致會議陷於僵局，無結果而散。</p>
<p>又訊：英法今日就馬歇爾復興歐洲計劃。公開與蘇聯發生破裂，在破裂前，莫洛托夫發表長篇演說，痛斥英法之建議，謂該項建議將使歐洲分爲兩集團，造成新的困難。莫氏並向英法兩國提出警吿曰：「蘇聯政府認爲英法兩國對於一切後果，應負其責。此種後果，即向復興歐洲途徑，背道而馳是也。」莫洛托夫定明日返蘇。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：據英法方面消息，貝文與皮杜爾預料莫洛托夫將拒絕法方提出之折衷方案，擬聯合籲請各國參加西歐復興計劃。據稱皮杜爾可能於星期五前往倫敦，與貝文詳談美國援助西歐復興計劃。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎一日電〕法外長皮杼爾今日向三國外長會議提出之計劃如下：英法蘇三國外長會議，重視加速進行歐洲戰災國家經濟復興及發展之需要，本會認爲此一任務，將因馬歇爾國務卿於六月五日建議之由美國供給經濟援助而獲得何利。本會感覺首先應由歐洲發展其經濟生產以資自助，美國之援助將使歐洲得以進行此項任務，並使歐洲在得以自行獲取必要之資源以前，由美國供給此等資源，對於歐洲實具有決定性之效用。故美國之援助，將爲歐洲國家復興其經濟，維護其獨立最確切之保證，於茲將設立一特別機構，以儘速收集準備歐洲資源及需要報吿所需之一切情報。此一機稱將由願意參加之歐洲國家組織之。此機構將不干涉此等國家內政，亦決不採取足被視爲侵犯此等國家主權之行動，以及足以妨碍歐洲國家貿易發展之行動。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾發表演說　謂美決無帝國主義野心援歐計劃旨在自助助人</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓一日電〕馬歇爾國務鄉今日向全國婦女新聞會發表演說，駁斥美國具有帝國主義目標，並企圖利用其援歐計劃，遂其政治及經濟統治野心之說，斥之爲幻想的曲解及惡意的誹謗，並曰負責此種惡意宣傳之人，對於困苦民族殊有換害。此等民族之未來，固有賴於國際經濟之合作。</p>
<p>馬歇爾雖未直接述及蘇聯或巴黎會議或渠之援歐計劃然當渠述及外界對美國供給之援助，批評多於贊賞時，其目標何在已昭然若揭。馬歇爾雖駁斥指美國其有帝國主義目標之說，但同時亦聲明美國人民貢獻其財力以助世界復興之際，並非毫無要求。美國人民鄭重要求不論彼等所提出之供獻爲如何，均須有效地予以利用以完遂預期之目標。美國人民之貢獻，決不能供自私的政治及經濟目標之用，祗能專供協助經濟復興之用。最後美國人民之援助並具有偉大之目標，以恢復美國人民之希望及信任，俾知世界他日必獲和平及安全。馬歇爾並鄭重指出美國軍隊已自歐洲撤退，聲明歐洲國家內並無願供美國利益之驅使，並企圖自內部征服政府之政黨存在。美國亦無間諜以企圖把持歐洲國家之警察設備。此外亦無美國與歐洲合組之公司，强迫歐洲政府承認。再就自戰爭結束以來，美國援歐之數字言，計援助歐洲之物品，戰後已達八千二百萬噸之鉅，價値逾九十億元。馬鄉並聲明渠之列舉此等事實，並不在吹噓，而係鑒於他人對美國之指責，實不得不使人勿忘此等事實也。就歷史上之記錄觀，從未有人較援助困苦人民之美國人民，更爲慷慨而不自私者。歷史上雖亦不乏援助他人之例，然其目標均不外乎在求自身之滿足。今美國政府之協助恢復世界經濟，亦並非完全本於慈悲之立塲，美國人民相信世界之安定與繁榮，亦為美國人幸福之重要因素。美國人民承認其他人民及國家在戰爭期間所作之重大犧牲，亦未始不爲一種貢獻。馬卿於開始演說之時，並曰他人亦有責美國之外交政策反覆無常者，其實美國雖在變幻之局勢中，仍保特其一貫的政策。聯合國機構之設立，美國當予最大助力。今此一國際機構之原則，在在遭遇阻碍，不能不令人大感失望及不安。美國人民已知戰後的世界局勢並不如預期之佳，而今後之任務猶較三年前所預料者更爲艱鉅。但美國人民建立使聯合國原則得以運用並發展的世界之決心，並無絲　變更。美國之政策即係以此等決心為基礎。馬　並力言報紙及電台在促成民衆了解外交事務方面之重要性，蓋在具有新聞自由之國家，縱有曲解的宣傳，亦不難在合理的時間內予以糾正也。</p>
<h3>法方新建議　已難倒莫洛托夫</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞肚倫敦二日電〕關於法外長皮杜爾所提之新建議，欲使巴黎會議圓滿結束一項努力，「每日郵報」頃加以評曰：英法一一國今日「難倒」莫洛托夫，至少使其在一日之間有無所適從之感，蓋莫洛托夫已面臨蘇驕附庸國皆急欲接受美國之援助一項事實故也。莫洛托夫今要求予以時間，容其考慮，其故殆即在此。「泰晤士報」評曰：莫洛托夫亦不贊同法國之建議，還在歷次會誠席常不願究全拒絕任何建議，故可料其明日將提出反建議，使對方加以考慮或拒絕。「每日電聞報」亦謂：莫洛托夫今在考慮此項値得考慮之建議，渠或將再向莫斯科請示訓令云。</p>
<h3>塔斯社宣布蘇外長建議</h3>
<p>〔路透社英斯科二日電〕塔斯肚今日發表莫洛托夫外長昨夜向巴黎會議所提建議案之內容，全文如下：法英蘇三國外長承認加緊歐洲戰災國國家經濟之復興及繼續發展之重要性，並信此項計劃執行，將由美國供給之經濟援助而獲得便利。馬歇爾國務卿固已於六月五日發表關於此項援助之聲明，三國外長會議相信起草歐洲國家之通盤經濟計劃，並非本會之任務，良以此項經濟計劃之擬具，擬有其他若干國之參加，亦不免强迫他國接受强國之意思，構成干涉他國內政，侵犯他國主權之情形。</p>
<p>且草具歐洲國家之通盤經濟計劃，足以擾亂歐洲國家間現存之經濟關係，引起各該國間之摩擦，使歐洲各國間極度必要之經濟關係更難發展。職是之故，三國外長會議認爲宜採取下列之步驟：設立援助委員會，由法英蘇三國代表及其他歐洲國之代表組成，以調査歐洲國家對經濟援助之需要，美國給予此等援助之可能性及協助歐洲國家獲得此等援助。在援助委員會之下，將設立糧食。燃料。配備等小組會，每一小組會由英法蘇三國代表會同嘗被德國佔領及有功於擊敗敵人之歐洲國家中，擇其對於該小組會之工作具有特殊利害關係之兩國代表組成之。前敵國亦得應小組會之邀，提出意見。德國之問題，由英法蘇美四强審査之。援助委員會之任務，在：（一）接受歐洲國家有關美國援助之估計；（二）根據此等估計草具自由計劃，於此應使曾遭德國侵略並有功於盟國勝利各國，獲得優先考慮；（三）調査美國給予適當經濟援助之可能性；（四）樹立對聯合國歐洲經濟委員會之關係。</p>
<h3>美前助理國務卿　痛斥侵略國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約一日電〕曾任助理國務卿之紐約自由份子領袖貝爾，頃在歡迎義大利社會黨領袖　拉加與　悌戧之宴席上致辭稱：對議和約乃用以樹立歐洲和平之外交策略，但和平尙未來臨，故美國在保持及重建義大利獨立國方面，仍自給予援助之義務。美國人民認爲義國之社會制度乃係由義人自行決定之事，美國所欲者乃自由獨立之義大利，不受任何外國之控制。美國人民正在支持馬歇爾計劃，以解放歐洲於飢餓，窮困及擾亂之外，義大利乃馬歇爾計劃中之重要因素。貝氏深信美國人民及國會將贊同在馬歇爾計劃之下供應金錢與物資，幷謂：「莫斯科方面所傳美國行將在經濟崩潰之說顯係無稽之談，美國人民目睹若干國家一方面壓制人民之自由，欺陵鄰國，幷進行擴軍，一方面向美國訴說貧困，此爲美國人民深感憢惑而百思不解者。美國人民不惜以數百萬鉅款救濟窮困，但不願捨施分文予侵略國家。」</p>
<h3>麥帥對日措施盟國益增反感　預料澳在和會中必有強硬表示</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京二日電〕英國外交部發言人之明確表示對於美國對日政策之若干點表示不滿，頗獲此問各盟國代表之好評。麥帥總部官員嘗表示在和平會議中，澳大利亞之態度預料將最難應付。自英國正式抗議准許日本捕鯨及在安戈亞島採磷後，復有英外部發言人之明確表示，可證英澳立塲並無二致。英澳對於麥帥之「精神革命」，尤表懷疑，彼等認爲稱日本業已棄絕黷武主義似猶覺過早，彼等對於麥帥所擘劃之日本的未來，尙不感覺樂觀。對於麥帥總部之宣傳美國爲給予日本利益，而其他盟國則均待機以壓迫日本，尤表不滿。中國對於佔領政策之批評，較英國更爲深刻而無微不至。例如麥帥指令之准許日本警察備帶步槍手槍，中國表示反對，而中國人民及朝鮮人民在日本之待遇，尤使中國代表憤慨。至於蘇聯則始終未認佔領政策有一是處，蘇聯自始即反對麥帥總部之工資政策，物價管制捕魚權利及農田改革等等措施。</p>
<h3>英方駁斥　麥帥總部聲明</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京二日電〕不列顚共和邦官員對於麥帥總部發言昨夜所發表關於准許日本捕鯨及在安加島採磷之談話，深表驚駭。彼等認此兩事在經麥帥總部批准前，應先經關係國之討論。就關於捕鯨之討論言，距完成之期尙遠；至於採磷一事，則根本未曾徴求其他盟國之意見。捕鯨牽涉澳洲及紐西蘭之經濟及軍事問題，且有先決和約應行處理事件之嫌，得爲嚴　抗議之理由。</p>
<h3>安理會南代表斷然否認　南協助希游擊隊　並指責美故意袒護希臘</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖一日電〕關於聯合國詞査巴驚幹委員所提出之報吿書，頃由聯合國安全理事會加以討論，席間南斯拉夫代表斷然否認南國協助希臘游擊隊反抗希臘政府，據稱：希臘曾向調査委員會提出邊界衝突事件五十七起，指斥南國協助希臘游擊隊，調査委員會僅審査其中之四起，其後即立刻斷定南國應負此種邊界事件之責任，此在另一方面，南國政府亦曾向調査委員會提出希臘侵犯南邊界之事件七十九起，但均未由調査委員會予以考慮。美國出席聯合國調査巴爾幹委員會代表艾塞里琪草率從事，將責任歸諸希臘北　，其目的無非欲掩飾並無充分證據之事實而已。要之，南國希望安全理事會　密硏究調査委員會之報吿，以確切明瞭希臘北部局勢之眞相云。</p>
<h3>僑胞在日餐館三千餘家停業</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京二日專電〕日本政府刻令日本所有餐館咖啡店酒排間及其他各種飲館，自七月五日起停業至本年年底。日政府此項法令，對我僑胞及韓國人民所擁有或經營之飯店，亦同樣有效。凡違反此項緊急措施法者，將處以三年以下之徒刑或五萬日元之罰鍰。日本谷報認爲受此一法令影響之飯館酒店，將達廿萬家，且有估計因此而致失業者，將達四百萬人。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京一日專電〕日政府爲求節省糧食，禁止全國食店開業，因之日本境內三千餘家華僑開設之食店中，佔僑胞總數三分二之工人均受影響。我駐日代表團團長商　對此甚爲關注。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統簽署參加難民機構案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕杜魯門總統頃已簽署美國參加國際難民組織之法案。該法案授權政府撥付七千三百五十萬美元，作爲該組織此後十二個月之經費中美國所負担之款項。</p>
<h3>日議會開始質詢　片山強調排斥階級鬥爭　農相稱本年食糧短少二百萬石</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京二日電〕本日日議會開會情形而下：參院方面，上午由自由黨板谷，緣風會佐藤，社會黨吉川各代表，順序對片山首相昨日之施政方針演說，起立質問，而由片山首相及各大臣相繼答辯，午後零時二十分散會。衆院方面，下午一時五十分開會，先由加藤勘十質問，由片山，蘆田，平野，粟栖各大臣，相繼答辯。三時四十五分休息，四時六分再開。北村德太郞起立質疑，由片山，森戶各大臣答辯，淮加藤與北村之質問均不失爲與黨之立塲，故今日議會會議進行可稱順利。四時五十四分散會。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京二日電〕日議會本日賡續舉行，各黨之質問戰業已展開。片山首相及各大臣對各黨之質問，一一予以答辯，茲列舉於下：（一）片山首相對「一般政策」之答辯稱：在政治行動方面，決排除一切秘密主義，不容許極端之思想與行動。雖承認階級之存在，然排斥階級鬥爭；至於罷工，係勞動者之正當權利，故承認之。一切政治皆通過議會制度行之，絕對排斥官僚之獨善主義。（二）平野農相對「食糧問題」答辯稱：至新榖上市之今秋爲止，日本所需之主要食糧數量，爲一千六百五十二萬石，而今年之徴購總量及輸入食糧之拋出預定量，合計不過一千四百十八萬石，尙欠一百三十四萬石，即每人尙差十六日之食糧，再加上迄今爲止所遲配之十二日食糧，約共差一個月之食糧。因此，若維持現在之配給量，必須根本改變下年度之米榖徴購量，故在此次國會中，特提出有關此一問題之法案。（三）水谷商相對「國家管理」答辯稱：煤炭國家管理，並不實行官僚統制，而充分注意其民主化，並擬確保三千萬噸之預定產量。（四）森戶文相對「學校敎育」答辯稱：不管人口已否增加，但在戰爭期中，學校並未增設，反而因戰災而减少八萬餘校，其中百分之三十無校舍，現在之政策即盡量恢復常態。</p>
<h3>美參院外委會將討論前日委治島託管問題　美凖備參加南太平洋會議</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日專電〕美參院外委會將於七日討論美國及聯合國關於管制前日本委任統治地之協定，該委任統治地即馬里亞·馬紹爾與加羅林羣島。根據業由聯合國安理會通過之協定，該三地均置於「戰略區」之管制，美國於必要時，得在此諸島建立防禦設備，並得禁止該島對外人往該地遊歷。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓一日電〕參院外委會主席范登堡頃向報界談稱，本委會業已核准美國參加加勒比安海委員會（該會係由英美法荷四國代表組織之）及南太平洋委員會。（該會係由英美法荷澳洲五國代表組織之）。按此項會議之員的，至於國際協力促進該兩區內非自治區域之文化。</p>
<h3>蘆田均欲蓋彌彰　仍圖覬覦鄰近本土島嶼</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京二日電〕日外相蘆田二日鄭重聲明，日無領土野心，並堅稱日本忠實遵守波茨坦宣言，放棄武裝力量，迄今爲止，盡其全力，促成日本之民主化。蘆田發表此項聲明，乃在衆院召開全體大會中答覆社會民主黨議員加藤之質問者，加藤稱：據報載消息，蘆田曾表示日本要求歸還冲繩島及千島利島，此予人印象，謂日有領土野心。據蘆田吿議會議員稱：渠之談話發表於六月五日接見外國記者時，不幸消息以訛傳訛。日本之領土，將由未來之和會作最後決定，「惟其中有若干鄰近北海道及九洲之島嶼，無論在種族上及歷史上向爲日本本部之一部。吾人從無以武力獲得領土之意，此乃予所欲吿知外國記者之本意」</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京二日電〕片山首相本日在參議院答辯佐藤尙武（綠風會）之質問時稱：蘆田外相在本屆內閣中實具有副總理大臣地位。由此足以說明現內閣並非不重視外交問題。</p>
<h3>暹羅越南柬埔寨籌組東南亞聯盟</h3>
<p>並擬邀印度印尼等參加</p>
<p>〔聯合社曼谷一日電〕暹羅總理那華蘇華今日宣稱，暹羅與法國將發起由暹羅。柬埔寨，與越南組織東南亞洲同盟；印度·印尼與婆羅洲三國日後亦當被邀參加。該同盟將討論東南亞地區灌漑·漁業·與交通事宜。</p>
<h3>智利最高法院宣佈　對日戰爭狀態終止</h3>
<p>〔合衆社智利京城二日電〕智利最高法院一日下午宣佈智利與日本之戰事已吿結束。據稱，智利事實上雖未與日本簽訂和約，但並不需要締約而結束戰事狀態，蓋戰爭結束後，戰事狀態亦吿結束，此舉不乏前例，諾如一八六五年智西之戰，一七二〇年法西之戰等比比皆是。此舉之重要意義，在於利用對日作戰狀態之存在與否，作爲政治競爭之法律手續，舉例而言，法律規定智利參衆兩院議員僅能在戰爭期間担任政府中職位，因此，參議員杜哈特得任副總統，喬里德得任外長，鮑賽得任經濟部長，里奧斯得任敎育部長。</p>
<h3>印尼內閣仍未產生爪哇海岸砲戰又起　華僑要求我國承認印尼</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞二日電〕印尼共和國對美國調解印荷危機之照會，不久可望掛出答覆。據此間荷蘭方面訊：印尼四大黨之政見懸殊，或不能取得協議。據印尼方面訊：上星期辭職之前總理沙利將在一兩日內返日惹出任要職。共和國通訊肚報吿稱：索卡諾總統曾與社會黨領袖夏利福亭，國民黨之加尼，以及勞工領袖賽太傑特等會商組閣事，組織左翼國民黨內內閣頗有可能。雖無最大黨（回教黨）之參加，此亦將爲堅强之內閣。按國民黨爲第二大黨，在國會中佔四十七席。同時據悉，國民黨對夏利　亭出任總理，並無反對。</p>
<p>又據日惹息：總理之職或將委任回敎黨之前內政部長羅姆，而據回敎領袖蘇黨曼則稱並未接獲是項請求。</p>
<p>〔合衆肚巴達維亞二日電〕印尼軍事發言人今日報吿稱：荷艦兩艘在爪哇東海岸與印尼砲台開火，擊毀瞭望哨房屋三間與電報綫。交戰援有荷蘭輕巡洋艦一艘經過砲台。然未肇事。但此訊荷方未加證實。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞二日電〕據安尼達通信社息：荷屬東印度之最大華僑團體中華社，開會決定要求中國政府，正式承認印尼共和國。</p>
<h3>日本巨額黃金盟總要求解凍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京二日電〕據合衆社獲悉：盟軍總部業向遠東委員會提出要求，將約值二億美元之日本凍結黃金及其他貴金屬，供盟軍總部之用，作爲購買原料之附屬保證金，此項金屬現封存於日本銀行中。此間認爲此事乃盟軍總部之經濟科學組之另一企圖，爲日本獲得周轉資金，以供購買自身可淸償之大宗原料之用。據指出，二億黄金之附屬保證金即能獲得數倍於此之貸款，因此間認爲美國或他國商人之願將原料轍入日本者，如能獲得百分之二十黄金保證，即甚感滿意。預料遠東委員會中若干委員，將表示反對，渠等向視封存於日本銀行之黄金，祇能作爲賠款之用</p>

<h3>公用事業新價擬定　趙局長將晉京洽商最低一倍最高三倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公用事業調整之新價目，業經公用局核算竣事，原定由趙局長曾珏携赴南京，經昨日之全國物價會議通過後實行。後因物價會議臨時展期，故漲價尙須等候若干時日。惟各公用事業機關因舊價虧損甚鉅，而全國物價會議之召開尙無定期，故趙局長頗現焦急，昨日曾與南京通話，略謂若全國物價會議一時不擬召開，則渠將先行晋京，親謁行政院張院長洽商。據趙局長昨語記者稱：公用事業調整價格之基本方式，業經擬定，即以燃料，外匯，生活指數等作爲根據渠此次赴京，希望能求得澈底解決，俾今後本市公用事業可依據，旣定方式自動調整價格，不必每次有待於全國物價會議之決定。</p>
<p>至於此次公用事業調整後之新價目，雖經決定，然未經中央核准之前，趙局長尙不願發表。惟據渠表示：因各公司成本上漲各有不同，調整之價格亦有上落，大致最低者爲一倍，最高者亦不出三倍。</p>
<h3>中美無綫電話暫停接受掛號　收費甚低供不應求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中美無綫電話前日起正式開放，市民前往掛號者極多。但因太陽黑斑作崇，每日僅於下午九時至翌晨一時通話四小時，且氣候變化亦能臨時影響電波之傳遞，故每日至多能打出十餘次，現電信局將已接受掛號者編列日程，並於昨日起暫停接受掛號，估計目前已掛號者，須於本星期五始能全部通話完畢。據電信局國際無綫電話負責人吿記者：照中美兩國邦交之密切，通訊需要之股，原在意料中，故無綫電話掛號者之擁擠勢所必然。又因取費過廉，將增多一般非必需而單爲好奇者所爭用，蓋上海與重慶之加急電話費每次已爲十六萬三千元，而中美通話一次僅需十四萬四千元，實不甚合理。但限於中美契約，如外匯不變更，電話費亦不致增漲也。</p>

<p>該聯合會籌備委員楊管北，李震良等，昨日下午六時假銀行俱樂部招待新聞界報告籌備經過及成立該聯合會之任務。據李雲良稱：復員以來，國人對於航業之認識漸深，興趣日濃，使不絕如縷之航業，重呈光明活潑之氣象。回溯我國航業過程，自南京條約至抗戰開始之九十五年爲被侵略時期，抗戰八年爲犧牲與停頓時期，勝利後，始步入復興階段。今本會成立後，對於復興航業之各種基本問題，當集合全國力量解決。</p>
<p>最要任務可分五點</p>
<p>其最要之任務，可分五點言之：（一）我國航業發展至今，已入重要階段，對內爲內河及沿海航行權之維護，對外在謀海外航業之發展，以代替各國，尤其是日本已往在遠東航業之地位。（二）建立現代化及健全之航船事業，革新業務經營，廢除已往買辦之傳統腐敗制度。（三）舉辦與航業有關之各種事業，如造船及訓練航行人才，辦理保險，修建碼頭倉庫等。（四）協助政府，迎頭趕上世界航業水準，如騐船，安全，互相承認，交換情報等。參加一切國際性之航業會議，藉與各國航業發生密切聯繫，以期達到世界海上安全會議標準。（五）謀取同業間以及與各業之聯繫。最後並稱：上海船噸占全國百分之八十以上，總噸數爲六五八，八八〇，八五噸，今後我國航業仍將以上海爲中心。關於航業界所需燃料，李雲良在昨晚記者招待會上報吿稱：所需煤油，己與石油公司協定，由該公司經常供應，惟用煤則因目前增價百分之二十，二百噸之船需煤款一萬萬元，實不勝負担，問題至爲嚴重。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑</h3>
<p>（一）兩夫爭妾</p>
<p>常熟朱君信問　鄙友張君於廿七年春，與李姓女同居，彼原係徐某之妾，事變時，李與徐逃難離散，因生活所迫，與鄙友張君實行同居，現徐某已返家，敦促李女士返歸團聚，茲有疑點三則，敬請指示，（一）鄙友張君與李女士同居己十年，倘徐某堅欲李女士返家團聚，而李女士亦不願去，張君亦拒絕，法律上是否有何責任？（二）李女士與徐某生有一女，現年十二歲，返歸母家時，年僅二歲，一切撫養讀書生活等費，均由張君負担，現該徐君欲其生女領回自養，張君可否拒絕，否則可否要求返還生活費用（自二歲起至十二歲止）。（三）李女士之生母尙健在，李現年三十二歲，十八歲時，父　即逝世，被其父之庶母誘拐價賣與徐某作妾，並未得生母之同意，現生母可否出面控吿庶母誘拐之罪？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）妾之制度，爲現行民法所未規定，以其不合男女平等之原則，該女不願作妾，隨時可與家長脫離關係，（見廿年最高法院上字第一四三七號判例），（二）生父領回非婚生子女，任何人不得加以拒絕，張旣收養徐某之女十年己有養父關係，民法並未規定養子女於收養關係終止時回復其本姓與回復其本生父女關係，養父得向其本生父要求賠償損害之明文。（三）李之庶母略誘其脫離家庭，査刑之最高度爲七年以下，追訴權時效十年，今己達十四年自屬無權追訴。</p>
<p>（二）越俎代庖</p>
<p>葉傑君　敝友某甲與乙女發生戀愛，然乙方家長並收丙方聘金一百萬元，現乙女欲不顧家長反對與甲男結婚，但有法律問題數則請賜答：（一）甲乙自行結婚是否違法？（二）乙將訂婚禮洋退還丙方，丙方如拒絕接收應如何處理？（三）丙方能否要求乙方賠償損失。（四）如乙不滿法定年齡（十九歲）上能否自己擇訂婚姻？（五）丙方有否控吿乙方父母之權利？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕婚約應由男女當事人自行訂定，父母代未成年子女訂定婚約，當然無效。故本件（一）甲乙可以結婚，但乙如未成年，應得法定代理人之同意。（二）無不接受理由。（三）如無其他損害自不能要求賠償。（四）如乙未滿二十歲，無論訂婚或結婚，均應得法定代理人之同意。（五）應視丙有無其他損害爲定。</p>

<h3>馬華隊後衛大將陳家壽參加星島　星島敗於馬華原來大將受傷</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕虎隊自出征以來，未運敵手，師次星洲，初遭敗績，三比一受制於馬來華僑隊，細硏其故，原來前鋒傷了三名，兩翼秋亭和何應芬傷了，張金海也有毛病，於是迫得以高山龍任右翼，劉松生充左翼。</p>
<p>這一下調動，毛病來了，劉高兩將，從後防調到前方，守旣鬆了陣脚，攻又不如意，於是敗了一陣。</p>
<p>我早就說過，這技遠征軍，翼鋒人材不足，果然不錯。</p>
<p>現在電訊傳來，馬華隊最佳之右後衛陳家壽，隨星島征英。這一來，守力是再强一步了，可是前鋒如何，担心，担心！</p>
<p>這次遠征大軍裏，混着一名西洋大將高山龍——即小吿山奴，此子球藝不錯，與乃兄大吿山奴稱雄香港，李惠堂亦不過如是，（小吿山奴會任港埠際隊長八次。）在足球隊中，每一個位置，都玩得非常出色。</p>
<p>現隨軍遠征，客串了幾塲左後衛，都曾建立殊功，不愧名將。</p>
<p>朱永强原是南華的好內鋒，此次參加星島征歐，在鋒綫上，旣串中鋒，又打起左翼來，特別是踢了兩三塲的左翼，搶盡不少鏡頭，「小朱」的基本功夫很好，要是他能力求上進的話，將來世運選材，少不得他的位置。</p>
<p>在一羣「元老」球將中，還能够鎭壓陣脚的，一個是「神腿」馮景祥，另外一位便是「鐵腿」孫錦順，一「神」，一「鐵」，仍有世運時代「台型」，丰采依舊。</p>
<p>現在「神腿」又領軍征戰，不但是全軍的重心領導大將，還在廿碼外淸脆射進幾球，名將自有身手在。</p>

<h3>乒乓總決第五幕　滬星今晚戰郵乙　總決第四戰精武險勝綠隊</h3>
<p>二屆上海乒乓聯賽，八强總決第四戰，於前晚八時在中央大會堂舉行，二部冠軍精武對抗四部亞軍綠隊，觀衆四百餘人，精武本屆抱奪標雄心，實力甚厚，然是晚竟大受新軍綠隊之威脅，殊出意外，戰幕旣啓，精武以主力衝陣，銳不可當，連克三營，第四組精武全材好手楊開運，演出失常，對手陳銀洲反敗爲勝，以三對二克服楊開運，堪稱得意傑作，楊輕敵見負，幾乎牽動大局，五六兩組，綠隊急起直追，先後奏捷，扳成各三平手，末組決戰精武賴高宏興之穩健抽擊，以三對一力取綠隊削手李榮就，奠定勝基，結果精武以四對三擊退綠隊，冷門未出，可謂險矣。</p>

<h3>紡調會集合國民營紗廠　徹底實施共同配銷　以消減黑市取締囤積為最終目標</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會共囤配銷棉紗，昨日縝續由中國紡建公司代為配紗三〇一件，全部配予棉秒複製各業，各廠申購單共一四七張。</p>
<p>該會寫繼續　計如何澈底實施共同議價。共同配銷製起見，昨日上午十時，特召開成品運銷小組會。蓋目前臨時辦法，誓由國民營紗廠各提供配紗一萬件，盡本月十五日前繳清，在共同配銷　稱尚未組織前，暫借紡建公司原有人乎照該公司原定酊售辦法配售。至如何使國民營紗廠產紗，掃數歸紡調會共同配銷機構掌搬，外埠棉紗，又如何供應運銷，在在均須從辭規定，俾實遵循辦理。民營廠方面，雖主共同議價，個別配銷，以維持各廠營業自由　。惟紡調會為貫徹共同配銷制起見，對未來共同配銷機構之組縱，允由民營廠多負主持之　甚致配銷機構，亦可設於第六區棉紡公會內。惟共同配銷制務必澈底施行。質言之，在該項奠體配銷制下，國民營紗廠全部之產紗，集中由共同配銷楊柳配銷。所配各紗，事前須經紡調會核許，以杜流弊，而一配價。以奠達到消滅黑市，取締囤積之最終目標。聞昨日會議席上，意見頗見融治，谷出席委員，對紡調會立場，表示可以接受考慮。聞　個共同配銷制辦理細則，可望於本月七日前有重要之決定。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據關係方面表禾：政府在供給行總視花，及第一二　兩季　　進口外棉美金六千萬元後，將視現時棉紗調節施策所獲之成果如何，而決定新施策。聞如目前共同配銷制，賓施不如理想，則對第三季之限額進口外棉，或將採行代紡代織政策。屆時中政府供給原料，委託各廠代紡棉紗，而付給各廠合理之不　云。</p>
<h3>經營者墨守成法　豬鬃外銷不振　目下以漢口貨最受歡迎</h3>
<p>我國對外貿易銳減，實堪重視，即以輪出主要品豬鬃一項而論，根據本布經營斯項業務著名廠商，如四川　產，崇德，　豐，和源，等調查統計，其前月份出口數量，僅及四月份百分之十五，上月份成交吏為稀少。如此現象，非僅影饗國庫收益，即對國際市塲地位，亦將日漸沒落。政府當局早已顧慮及此，曾囑中央信託局組織出口物資審價委員會，以協助出口商。</p>
<p>茲據豬鬃業領袖談；我國豬鬃貿易不振，不僅內（一）國內成本高昂，市價上漲，（二）走私猖獗，跌價傾銷。（三）海外市價已達飽和點，且在美政府平定物價政策下，買難轉好諸點。其最大　結，則為我國經營斯業者，（一）製造方法缺少現代科學化，（二）其推銷法不能把握需要者心理，一味因陋就簡，偷工減料，逐漸將過去光榮歷史削減，若不謀取澈底改良，將蹈一蹶不振之危機。當前最顯著之現象，為：（一）尺寸不夠標準，（二）　性不均，（三）光澤欠佳。簡言之，均係距離利用科學方法太遠，其中最艱钜之　性測驗工作，往往依賴有經驗人員，僅以手指及掌心握　之知覺以判斷之，安能保持永久平衡，其失敗可知。</p>
<p>豬鬃十七種中最名貴者，為「廿七號配箱」，其尺寸又有由二寸至六寸者，我國產地以天津最佳，毛長色潤，　性亦極上乘，該貨大都由西北運來，乃寒冷地區氣候使然。戰時西北貨改入渝地，造成川鬃，名聞海外，當時以對美對蘇輸出最多，充作軍用品為洗刷槍　口經之工具。勝利後，漢口鬃在美頗受歡迎，以其　性勻整所致，是以目前渝貨在美每磅僅售二角六分美元，漢貨則售三角三分。該發言人又稱：美人心理喜新厭舊，現在牙刷毛原料住往舍用豬鬃而改用人造「尼隆」成品代替者，是為我國豬鬃對外銷路之又一打擊云。</p>
<h3>各種棉織品　將實行議價</h3>
<p>經濟部紡織事業調節委員會，訂定各支棉紗新議價，並實行棉紗聯合配銷政策以後，今日市場恢復交易，將依新議價加百分之五合法利潤買賣。據悉當局為穩定一般棉織製品價格起見，對於棉布衫襪毛巾等各種棉織品，亦將依照棉紗議價，加以合理利潤，規定議價，俾商人知所依遵。</p>
<p>如超越議價，企圖獲取暴利，亦決予以嚴懲。此項辦法，在準備中。</p>
<h3>美金庫券公債　擴大普遍募銷</h3>
<p>正式庫券下月初司印竣</p>
<p>美金庫券公債預約券，最近銷路突趨良好，募銷委員會決繼續擴大募銷，將大規模向各階層市良普遍募銷。至正式庫券公債，現正在滬趕印中。財部公債司長陳炳章，日前特再度來滬視察印製情形，預計下月初即可印竣，掉回原發售之預約券。一俟正式庫券公債發售後，可能立即在交易所公債市塲上市，以便利持有者之運用云。</p>
<h3>捲烟趨勢疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市勢續呈疲軟，蓋經濟會定今日開始澈查物價，投機者將受打擊，是以人心忐忑；兼以銀錢業休假期滿，絀於頭寸者頻加斬吐，喊價步做步降。十支大英烟小至七百二十八萬元間，成交頗多。廿支大英去胃較強，腳地亦硬。午市零　稍動，十支大英烟最後回至七百三十萬元，比上日步降五萬五千元。老刀烟亦挫五萬元，為六百三十萬元。五華牌聞外幫活動，軋好三萬元，為五百六十一萬元。哈德門仍站五百三十一萬元。全日趨勢，塲上所做交易華商烟較多，又以驚　爛係，廠方產量減少，派貨頗多延期，籌碼不充，故腳地獨堅。</p>
<p>又美貨六根駱駝罵力斯等條烟，及五十支茄力克三五牌等，聽裝烟做開甚少，買戶亦寡，市氣　頹。茄力克鬆至五萬八千元可以成交，三五牌五萬元始有買戶</p>
<p>紡建售紗</p>
<p>昨日紡建公司雖逢銀行決算假期，仍照例開紗，計有八種，價與二十九日紡調會，公怖之議價相若，計分十支陽鶴筒紗六，一二〇元（單位千元），十六支豐年大包，七，七四〇元，二十支立馬大包八，八〇〇元，三十二支仙桃筒紗一二，九四〇元，四十支實光草包一五，二三〇元，四十二　股藍鳳大包一七，二四〇元，六干支日光筒紗二二，五〇〇元，八十支雙股TK彩球大包四九，五〇〇元。</p>
<h3>肥皂上落微細</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂市而，以中國肥皂公司出品之「利華」藥水皂，因值夏令當銷，去胃甚健，塲上做開交易，比黃祥茂為熱鬧，市氣亦俏，聞喊價每箱昂至四十六七萬元，供售者甚稀。洗衣皂上午有吐舊，市勢下挫，午市交易較活，零星添辦不寂。最後固本皂比隔昨回升一萬元，為四十七萬元。箭刀軋升五千元，黃祥茂二二〇塊箱裝亦好一萬元，為卅萬零八千元。白祥茂一六〇塊箱　裝猛漲四萬五千元，為卅六萬元。光華皂亦升二萬五千元，其餘亨利牛牌鼎蜂等皂，俱升二萬至二萬五千元。火柴市勢均乏變動，洋燭雞牌掛二十八萬元堅穩。</p>
<p>火油市面。塲內做開平　，惟以存底尚充，拋賣不寂，行情明償暗鬆。高度桶油價在入十五萬元間可以成交，美孚除聽九萬七八千元，惟門舊微告提升，每杓二千二三百元不等。</p>
<p>油脂匱乏　市價上升</p>
<p>皂燭主要原料柏油用　，牛油等市價，日來飛　上升，十數日之間，竟高漲達百分之二百以上，行情混亂。頃據蓋業中人談稱：時屆夏令，油脂業原為淡季，交易均甚萎頓，產地存賞亦稅。各地皂燭製造廠向來習慣，均於夏季以前，儲足原料，渡此淡月。惟近年以來，由於經濟社會之不安定，此積季候性，習慣上已告打破，新貨須俟秋涼後方可上市，而現貨文日見匱乏，遂致造成抬價競購，互相看漲局勢，並形成投機現象，貽害民生非淺。</p>
<h3>細布市況略堅</h3>
<p>昨日棉布塲外徵有做鬨，細布較對開前略堅。十二磅龍頭細布喊償為四十四萬二干元，漂布元　變及深色士　布穩定。隔昨紡建供舊之水月及跳鯉漂布，均加碼三千元。跳鯉灰光斜加四千元，四君子金印元嗶　則倒貼一千元。</p>
<h3>禁止購買黃金進口　港政府統制美鈔　出口商勢將受钜大影響</h3>
<p>〔合眾社香港二日電〕香港決定努力減少美鈔之消耗。並由於世界美鈔缺乏日趨嚴重，決定努力增加可得之供應數量。　政府業已頒佈一運數道之命令。禁止以美鈔購買之黃金進口，禁止公開市場勝置美鈔以為進口貨物之資金，並指定數家銀行。對某數項出口結算美鈔。其所結存美鈔之百分之廿五，應供政府動用。</p>
<p>香港一九四七年五個月之進出口貿易，乃進口多於出口，其相差額約為二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，其中大部分匯以美鈔償還．自美元區輸入貨物之進出口商，業已受政府　告，由於香港之美鈔供應萎縮，則此項支出費用將更趨嚴加限制。</p>
<p>迄目前為止，其影嚮尚祇限於自美輸人之奪得品項目，如塑料用品，收音機·電料用品，潤精，打火機，及類似之各項雜類用而。黃金禁止入口同時舉行後，其雙管齊下之效果，一方面減少美鈔之消耗，另一方面亦可滿足中國政府之抗議，謂此項貨物，乃打破中國之關稅壁壘，漏稅輸入中國境者。</p>
<p>最近公佈較嚴峻之禁令，其影響及於各出口商恐將更大，此項禁令規定輪出桐油錫及橡膠至美元區之出口商，將百分之廿五之美元結匯，以港幣四元等於美鈔一元（公開市塲為港幣四元六角五等於美鈔一元）之官價，出售於　政府。</p>
<p>輸往美國者，在本年初起五個月中，約達美元一〇·〇〇〇，〇〇〇，佔對美總輸出百分之六十五。因比，如酮油市塲穩定，則香港政府，僅桐油一項出口，預料可獲得每月五十萬美鈔之收入。</p>
<p>若干貿易商向以自馬來進口橡膠，轉口輸美獲得美鈔，因橡膠能自由輸入香港也。由於香港業已以大宗美鈔，作為償付盟軍總部，及美國商業公司所售出之棉紗之用，此間商人，預料關於以美鈔交易，將更進一步加以限制云。</p>
<h3>日紡織業復活　香港商人擔憂</h3>
<p>〔合眾社香港二日電〕據商業消息霎通方面稱，八月十五日起日本私人商業恢復後，日本將重入世界紡織市塲及其所探取之政策，己引起此間布柴之不安。彼等深懼日木最近每月生產布匹一百四十萬碼，存積後將向布塲拋售。盟軍總部當局准許日本過額生產，現已引起削價競爭慘劇之危險。唯一補救之法，　為將日本所囤積之紡織品分發予其國內消耗。香港商人在過去十八個月中，曾以大量紡織品輸往運　來亞及荷屬東印度，傳該區現轉向日本定購大批紡織品。</p>
<h3>市銀行設立　第五辦事處</h3>
<p>上海市銀行前奉准市政府，在大名路一一二四號設立第五辦事處，茲悉：該辦事處業經準備就緒，定於明日（四日）正式開幕，除辦理銀行各種業務外，并代理上海市庫收付事宜。</p>
<h3>合作社擅營存放　市政府奉令取締</h3>
<p>〔本报讯〕財政部為配合經濟紧急措　方案，加強管制金融事业起見，经指定南京，上海，天津，北平，濟南，青島，漢口，廣州，重慶，西安，成都，杭州，紹興，寗波，蘇州，永嘉，昆明等十七地區，為限制商業行荘復業，及增設分支機構地點。然財部最近迭據報，各地頗有不肖份子，假藉信用合作社名義，公然經營普通存放款業務，述避管制，妨礙正常金融業務，影響社會經濟安全至大，日與一般擅行設立之「地下錢荘」性質並無二致，自應嚴加取締，以資整飭。市政府對於接護上項訓令後，業行轉飭所屋運照辦埋。</p>
<h3>江浙絲廠　定期開工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蠶絲產銷協導會，對江浙絲廠開工日期，已經決定於本月十五日前，須一律開齊。關於各廠所需燃料，苦煤及石油等，該會已將三區繅絲公會所填報各廠需用量及開工日期等，列表送呈燃管會及中國石油公司，希迅予核准撥配，俾各廠能如期開工。再各絲廠開工所需之貨款，該會亦已電請四聯總處將八百四十億元，先行迅予核貸。</p>
<h3>呢絨被市看悄</h3>
<p>昨市大衣呢趨俏昂漲，客本幫咸有需辨，細毛光質花呢，茶會上亦多求過於供，章華綿羊　澳毛貨廠盤定價每碼四十萬元，定洋收七成，現貨沽價為三十七八萬元。防雨布因值霉令，需供兩廣。白紗斜昨成交三千餘碼，係麥強司定得路局號衣所購選。</p>
<h3>燃料取銷補貼　燃營會公布新價　每噸調整為五十四萬</h3>
<p>政府決定停止公用事業補貼後，燃料己隨之調整。據悉：燃煤新價，經燃料管理委員會　准經濟部核准，每噸為五十四萬元，已於本月一日實行。此項新價，係根據礦商成本訐算核定，上月成本即達四十五萬元一噸，而燃管會所配給公用事業及交通事業之用煤，每噸僅十餘萬元，由政府補貼二十餘萬，調整之新價，實為政府應補貼之數。故煤價之調整決非一般漲價之情形，可向日而語。此次每噸增為五十四萬，僅較上月加九萬，不足百分之十五，燃管會仍照舊供給交通及公用事業之需要，並配給公教人員之燃煤云。</p>
<h3>解決各地煤荒　將召開增產會議</h3>
<p>據燃管會消息：上海缺煤，迄今尚未解決，各地又　起　關煤荒，推其原委，係煤　以東北為主，在戰事　狀下，　　　出，其他若不急謀解決，煤荒將更縐嚴重。經濟部現為解決煤荒，將於本月中旬，召集各地煤礦代表，舉行「煤斤增產會議」，設法促進煤礦產量，以供谷地需要。會議地點，在京在滬，則尚未決定。</p>
<h3>浙省春貸欵　收購量九萬餘担</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州二日電〕浙省本年春　貸欵收　　量為九一〇五九　，共　貸款一〇六，九六三，九八四·三七五元·因貸款　到而流為土絲者約六萬組。較去年　　增產二分之一以上。按浙省去年　產為六一九四担。雲南新村公司蠶種　化不良，致蠶嚴受損一節，經決定由浙蠶客會中蠶公司各貼三億元賠償，中蠶之三億元，將以本年秋種或明年春種折付。</p>
<h3>本市棉商存棉調查　合計僅六九〇二七担</h3>
<p>棉花商業同業公會，日前奉吳市長論，調曬本市各倉庫存棉數量，俾供紡調會參考。茲悉：該項調查工作，業已完竣。各同業在谷倉庫存棉總數，計外棉（包括大小包裝）為四，三三四件，合一五，四五六担。國綿（大小包裝）計一四，九二六件，合五三，五七一担，合計為六九，〇二七担。據談會理事長劉　　表示，此項存棉總數，業巳送交市府，惟據紡調會日前估計，本市谷沙廠每天需用棉花三萬担，現此數僅夠紗廠二天原料云。</p>
<h3>本市草呢帽業　生產能力減低　受原料缺乏成本增高影饗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商轉導處調查：上海草呢帽同集公會會負廠計有八十餘家，以　星裝配廠居多數，擁有主要作業機五百三十五台，具有製造呢帽之全能工廠，則僅有十一家。其中以新華製帽廠，華　製帽廠，大來重絨帽坯廠為最大。餘如以帽坯製成呢帽，約有二十餘家。茲將笑業倩形，概述於次：</p>
<p>（一）生產能力　每年約可生產呢帽五十五萬打，本年出品僅可三十餘萬打。其喊少原因，為：（一）高利貸，（二）高工資，（三）交通阻梗，（四）進口羊毛兔毛受限制。若無前列四項困難。加開夜工，每年約可產一百萬打。</p>
<p>（二）銷路該業出品呢帽，行銷全國谷埠，尤以江浙二省區為最多，各廠均感供不應求。過去呢　，曾亦行銷南洋暹羅等地，現因原料缺少，成本增高等關係，難與外貨競爭矣。</p>
<p>（三）原料　據調查所得，該業　日工作十小時，月　羊毛十八萬磅，兔毛三千二百百磅，（或兔皮一萬磅）。</p>
<p>又查該業中有大來　絨　廠，其出口為兔子呢　子，其品質頗佳。原係美人　設，太平洋戰事發生後，被日人佔　，勝利後由經濟部接收。發還原主後：由原　　與國人。為國內僅有之兔絨帽坯廠。有特種機器，如割皮取毛車，飛毛成　車，彈毛　　車，和毛車等，均係美國製造，頗可應用。惟該廠近因受外匯限制，兔毛或兔毛皮（以兔毛皮　日較為合算）均告缺乏，已有停工趨勢，希望輸管會　到實際需要予以維持。</p>
<h3>食糧一致回挫</h3>
<p>後糧市因實銷較淡，吸胃不多，價乃轉軟。公會劃盤，秘魯砂六十六七萬元，二〇中砂白五十九萬五千元，小五千元。台　五十六萬元。小萬五千元。油　　開四十二　五千元，小萬餘元。　　　四十萬元，刁青三十八萬元，小五千元。製化白五十六七萬元至五十五萬元，興赤門中六　萬元。均小萬元，共成交三百七件。</p>
<h3>上海水泥公　召開股東會</h3>

<h3>船聯的目標　四海一家</h3>
<p>— 杜鏞</p>
<p>全國各地輪船業同業公會代表，抱着發展航業，維護航權的宏願，不遠千里而來上海，參加船聯——中華民國輪船業聯合會的成立大會，接着還要到南京出席交通部所召開的全國航政會議。這不僅是中國航業上空前禾有的一件盛舉，也是建國史上光榮的一頁。本人忝爲上海首席代表，謹以興奮的心情，代表上海一百多家同業，表示誠摯的歡迎</p>
<p>孔子說：四海之內，皆兄弟也。浩瀚的海津，縱横的江河都是人類文化交流，生活互助的憑藉。就國勢而論：誰能發展航運，利用海洋，誰就强盛富庶，力量充沛。我國海岸綫從北邊鴨綠江口的大東溝，到南方廣州灣的東興，包含許多島嶼在內，共有一萬零三三三哩，合三萬多華里，內河水道共有十萬多華里，過去還沒有充分利用，並且受不平等條約的束縛，航權被蹂躪了一百多年。實在是中國人的恥辱。現在航權已經收回，國運終必中興。如何促進航業建設，如何利用江海水道，以至公有的海洋，實在是我們這一代神聖的責任、</p>
<p>復員以來的局面，雖然是異常艱鉅；當前的各種問題，雖然令人感覺沉重，然而堅強弘毅，任甫致遠，本是航業精神。我們固然希望政府和社會各方面正視航業的重要性，特別加以獎助與維護，使它能够從戰時的摧毁之中，復興起來。同時，我們也不應忽略本身所負建國和救國的重任。我們決不孤立，也決不頽唐。西諺說：「榮譽之冠冕爲荆棘所織成」。一分耕耘，一分收穫。滿目的荊棘，那能阻礙我們的前進！只有增加大家奮鬥的勇氣。中國的江海，世界的大洋，都是我們耕耘的園地。船聯的誕生——全國輪船業的大聯合，是加强耕耘的號召。只要四海一家，同舟共濟，中國建設三百萬噸商船初步目標的成功還會遠嗎？</p>
<h3>組織中華民國輪船商業同業公會聯合會緣起</h3>
<p>— 杜鏞　徐學禹　楊管北　錢永銘　盧作孚　施復昌等</p>
<p>輪船業爲全國性乃至國際性之公用事業，江河縱横，海洋浩瀚，端賴舟楫之相通，乃獲文物之交流，一國之富强繫焉。各國多以航業爲立國之本，愛護獎助，不遺餘力；航商奉行國策，邁進不已，於以形成燦爛輝煌之歷史。我國受不平等條約之束縛，航權旁落，航業不振，歷一世紀之久，幸賴我政府與人民繼續不斷之奮鬥，卒獲收回內河及沿海航行權，凡我國人，對於航權之珍愛，旣匪同乎常情，而於航業之建設，更屬責無旁貸。我輪船業承疲憊之餘，肩中興之任，允宜羣策羣力，奮發蹈履，內謀水上交通之便利，外求江海航權之恢閉。現在商船噸位，已由復員初期殘餘之十萬噸，增至八十萬噸。各地同業公會之組織，日臻健全；同業合作之精神，日臻蓬勃。本會等爲加强全國輪船業之聯繫，團結全國輪船業力量，促進輪船事業之發展，協助政府航業政策之推行，爰發起組織中華民國輪船商業同業公會聯合會。</p>
<p>各地代表，已於本年五月十五日舉行發起人會議於上海，精誠團結，羣謀攸同，組織旨趣，可臄陳者：</p>
<p>（一）集中航商力量</p>
<p>航運事業，任重道遠，繼一往開來，衆警易舉，一業一地之孤立時期，已成過去，科學的羣衆時代業已到臨，自有需乎集體之勞力，以代替孤軍之奮鬥，聯合全國之力量，解決共同之問題。</p>
<p>（二）促進航業建設</p>
<p>全國各種船舶之配置，航綫之分配，港埠之設備，人材之儲訓，皆爲建設之要目，而爲本會工作之重點，</p>
<p>（三）振刷航業業規</p>
<p>航業爲重要社會事業，谷方關係，異常複雜，一切經營，必須注意法治精神與科學方法，以謀業務管理之刷新，各種陋規之革除，服務精神之發揮，海事責任之合理，人事糾紛之减少。</p>
<p>（四）維護本國航權</p>
<p>我國收回航權伊始，如何加以維護，如何加以恢閎，使外輪不再侵入我國內河與沿海，更進而發展海外航運，使我國旗暹揚於公海，尤爲全國輪船業之重要課題。</p>
<p>（五）連繫國際關係</p>
<p>本會組織後，當與各國航業團體，以平等互助之精神，密切携手，參加一切國際性之航運會議，並在按術上，迎頭趕上世界之水準。</p>
<p>本會任務，經緯萬端，茲所揭　，不過略舉要點，記曰：「敬業樂羣」；西諺亦云：團結即力量；我全國輪船業萬衆一心，志在四海一家，重光大業，萬舟同濟，永保航權，鍥而不舍，請從此始！</p>

<h3>航業競爭之特質</h3>
<p>— 李雲良</p>
<p>自伊麗沙白女王以武力打破當時葡·西·荷各國之閉海政策以後，各國對於海洋之管理權，乃以領海範圍即距離海岸三浬之海洋爲限；領海以外之海洋，根據自然法與國際法之理論，應爲人類之共有物，即所謂公海政策是也。至今英人猶津津樂道其女王之名言曰：「海洋與空氣，應由人類公用之，海洋之主權，不能屬於任何國家或私人」。在寰球一億三千八百餘萬方哩水面之中，江河湖沼不過一百萬方哩，而領海之面積亦極有限，故水面之大部份乃人人可以自由利用之公海。此種海洋自由實爲航業擴展與文物開拓之前提。自十七八世紀重商時代以來，冒險航行及拓植公司風起雲湧，商船噸位日增無已。雖在工業革命以後，鐵路亦相繼興起。然因水道在天然。工程。路程。投資各方面均比較經濟。即以燒煤而論：統計鐵路每噸哩需。〇六六磅，輪船僅爲·〇二九磅。故鐵路僅能為水道之補充而不能為其替代。然海運業本身因活動範團之廣大與設備成本之低廉，其營業性質又係所謂「空心生意」—不論承運貨客之多寡，航行成本大致相同。故先天即具有高度之競爭性。復因商戰關係，國與國爭，公司與公司爭，競爭旣趨劇烈，收益勢必减低，甚至賠累不資，無以圖存。迨兩敗俱傷，乃相與合作，共謀維持運價。過去百餘年來之航業史，殆如三國演義開塲所標之警句：「天下分久必合，合久必分。」分者，競爭也；合者，合作也。且以常例觀之，合作往往爲競爭之手段，如聯合同一航綫之船舶應付外來之競爭，是則分而合者也。</p>
<p>航業競爭之方式最常見者，爲跌價競爭。如戰前上海至台州航綫各輪船票價嘗一度跌至每客五角，由船東供應膳食，並各贈毛巾一條。上海運天津之麪粉，運價嘗一度跌至每包三分，由船東負担上下工力。上海至美國之雜糧運價，亦曾有過每噸四元之紀錄。</p>
<p>如有外來輪船加入本航綫，原有航商欲抵制之，則在競爭策略上有所謂戰鬥船（FightingSlup）者，即在原有航輪以外，另行配備一艘至若千艘相仿之船舳，與其同時航行，將運價特別減低，使本欲由新公司裝運之貨客悉被奪來。新公司成立伊始，實力未充，勢必半途退出或讓步講和也。</p>
<p>延期回扣制度（Deferred　sebateSystem）亦爲競爭之一種獨佔的手段。某一航綫各公司或茶一公司爲保持顧客將其貨物專裝而不向他公司船只報運起見，可與顧客協定或言明：如在規定期間（通常爲六個月）所有貨物全數歸本公司船隻裝運，則屆期末可由公司按照所付運費給予回佣若干成（通常爲百分之十）。如曾將貨物未經公司同意委託他船遝送，則不給回佣。又有爲鼓勵顧客多裝貨物而不限定其全數報裝者，亦輙採用累進延期回扣辦法，規定若干級標準，例如在一定期間還費總額達五百萬元給佣百分之十；達一千萬元給百分之十五，達一千五百萬元給百分之二十等。</p>
<p>與期扣制度相似之另一種方式，爲與顧客訂立長期裝貨合同予以優待特價及簡便手續。</p>
<p>以上各種競爭辦法，在長江航綫，在沿海航綫，在太平洋·大西洋等航綫，均曾實行。此外有在服務上競爭者，如辦理接送業務，如整飭茶房動務，如電話定艙送票，如舉辦海陸空聯運，如代客買賣貨物等等，則爲服務精神之恢閎而與鬥爭傾擠異趣者也。</p>
<p>於此吾人有應強調指明者：無節制之航業競爭常足以削弱競爭者之力量，馴至兩敗俱傷而弗克自拔。且航業之競爭也，非盡優勝而劣敗，反多劣船行險以微倖，使好船受害於無窮，有如經濟學上「惡幣驅逐良幣」之定律。蓋新建之好船。結構堅固，設備完善，造價輙達數十億元，而雇用優秀船員，按照定班航行，安全便捷，成本自亦較高。若有人罔顧航業之大局，祗圖個人之私利，以數千萬元購買勉强可以航行之舊船，甚至以更低之代價臨時租船，以簡陋之設備與較差之船員，加入供求適合或供過於求之航綫行駛，跌價競攬客貨，因其船劣本輕，往往可跌至半價以下。一般顧客祗貪便宜，罔顧安全，勢必趨之若驚，而原有班輪營業爲其所奪，難以維持。若曠日持久，好船有被劣船瓜代之厄運。此種現象在航業幼稚之國家如我國者，尤司空見慣。上海近海各航綫常有此類競航船出現，於是新建之好船乃如鳳毛麟角，數年不一見，誠爲航業建設之內在的毒癌而亟應療治者也。</p>

<h3>莎士比亞的譯者</h3>
<p>— 施瑛</p>
<p>莎士比亞戲劇全集（計四輯：第一輯喜劇，第二輯悲劇，第三輯雜劇，第四輯史劇）朱生豪譯　世界書局出版</p>
<p>厚厚的三册莎翁全集，放在我的案頭。我對着這幾本巨帙，發怔了好一會。生豪兄十年辛勤的結晶，終於出版問世了。我的心裏充滿驚懷舊傷逝的情緒。我不知道究竟我該推薦這部偉大的譯述呢？還是介紹這位才調無雙而隱淪沒世的譯者？</p>
<p>套一句成譯，莎士比亞太偉大了，我太渺小了，對於「籠罩一世凌越千古」的莎翁樂府，不必再加贅詞。次之，我的英語簡直是半瓶醋，讀莎翁原本，往往有格格不能下之概，至於把原文和譯文斟酌比較，以示自己也是研究有素的人，則更豈敢！但是想到莎翁戲劇譯出者已不鮮見，在一兩年前，就有曹未風敎授譯的全集出版。我不知道曹敎授和生豪兄從事莎翁全集的翻譯，孰先孰後；也不知道他們兩位所經歷的時間，孰長孰短。對於兩種譯本公允的批評，更有待於精研文學的專家老師，不容無學的我妄加褒貶。不過我的意思，如果有人對於莎翁傑作，久仰大名，而研讀原文有所未能的話，生豪兄這一部流暢優美的全集譯本，是値得推薦的。請看譯者的自白，就可以懂得他翻譯時的煞費苦心（雖然自白出以文言，全集劇詞却是淸淸楚楚的語體）：</p>
<p>余譯此書之宗旨，第一在求於最大可能之範圍內，保持原作之神韻；必不得已而求其次，亦必以明白曉暢之字句，忠實傳達原文之意趣。……務使作者之命意豁然呈露，不為晦澀之字句所掩蔽。每譯一段後，必先自擬為讀者，察閱譯文中有無曖昧不明之處，又必自擬為舞台上之演員，審辨語調之是否順口，音節之是否調和。一字一句之未愜，往往苦思累日。</p>
<p>上面的話，並沒有絲亳失之矜誇。生豪兄確是一個埋頭苦幹而工作極認眞的人。現在我對着這一部巨帙，閉上我的眼睛，一個文質彬彬的靑年書生的影像，還顯現在我的眼前：瘦長的個子，白晳的面容，溫和沉默的模樣，難得說一兩句話兒，緊接說話以後，總是一陣臉紅，他有着極度內向的性情，不是名士而是典型的詩人。他工作和讀書的時候，寄予全副精力，往往廢寢忘食。社交和名利跟這位淡泊的詩人是無緣的。</p>
<p>一個沉默的工作者</p>
<p>漫漫十年的翻譯工作呵，他所經歷的又是艱危困苦的歲月！記得我和生豪兄是中學時代的同學，因為他比我高兩級，我們雖然相識而不相熟。他畢業後升入之江大學，成績總是第一。民國廿四年春，我赴世界書局編譯所工作，才和生豪兄重新晤面。那時我們全在英文部任事，主任就是舊日的老師詹文滸先生。生豪兄的寫字桌，跟我的在一起，又因為工作上的聯繫，時常我所譯寫的稿件，墨瀋未乾，就遞到了他的面前，他便用紅墨水筆仔細校改。他是辦公室裏最沉默的人，往往整天不說一句話，旁人找他閒談，總是報以和藹的微笑，更繼之以險紅，於是完了。他之計劃翻譯莎翁全集，就是開始於廿四年的春天，並由於詹先生的鼓勵。但是他從不讓人知道他在嘗試做這件工作，別人只看到他在跑書鋪子，辛勤搜集各種莎集版本，及諸家註釋批評考證的書罷了。</p>
<p>亂中相逢獨携莎翁</p>
<p>八一三戰爭爆發時，我本於暑假中携眷返故鄉新市度夏，誰知因此出去不得，暫在老家避難。接着，日軍在杭州　登陸，兩路沿綫，人心皇皇，紛紛作避難計。十一月中旬，一個愁慘陰冷的下午，忽然一位不速之客來家造訪。他就是瘦長文雅的生豪。亂中相逢，欣喜無已。我們談了好一會，才知道他是偕同親族避難過此。世界書局編譯所在提籃橋區，他說在暴風雨前夕，半夜裏倉皇出走，丟了一切行李，只帶着一部原本莎翁全集和自己譯就的手稿。在千鈞一髮的關頭，他認為這個最寳貴！我問他以後的計劃怎樣？他說預備遷往鄕間小住，如生活稍能安定，就專心一志從事翻譯。我們聊天得高興，他把翻譯全集的經過和計劃，從頭至尾告訴了我。我在欽佩之餘，也沒有話說。</p>
<p>我再度逢到生豪兄的時候，是在已經成為孤島的上海，有兩次是在花園村，有兩次是在中美日報的編輯部。那時候他是一位以紙彈跟敵偽作肉搏戰的新聞記者，又是總編輯詹文滸先生最得力的助手。在偶然晤面的的閑話中，知道他對於翻譯工作還是念念不忘，但是公務繁重，苦無餘暇！</p>
<p>等到餘暇來了，但是更慘皓的現實，擺在他的眼前。那是太平洋戰爭的爆發，中美日報被封，他失掉了職業。他為了個性關係，不曾跟朋友們一起內行，仍舊留在上海，躱入亭子間裏，開始他久已響往的專心翻譯的工作。那時我住在鄉間，跟舊日的師友失掉聯繫，以為他總也間關西行，音訊不通，要打聽也無從打聽起！</p>
<p>杜門譯述貧病交迫</p>
<p>接着的幾年，是最艱苦的年頭，差不多每一個人，都是身心備受痛楚，而有「日暮途窮人間何世」之感！卅三年之夏，我擴在單帮客的羣中，由故鄕往上海一行，向舊居停世界書局接洽編幾本書，想藉稿費以博斗升。我還是記得生豪兄和他的莎翁全集，順便向書局主持人問起，誰知道相距非遙，生豪兄並沒有西行，却隱居在故鄉嘉興，繼續翻譯，筆耕聊作稻梁謀，跟我的情形相似！老實說是一樣的可憐！我興奮得很，回到家裏，馬上寫了封信寄嘉興。不多幾天，回信來了，一張綠格的原稿紙上，像並不是我熟悉的筆跡。信上說起他結婚後遄返故里，杜門譯述，生活日昂，稿費不是餬口，復以染肺疾，現在療養中。……世亂年荒，一個貧病交迫的忠厚文人，除了讓辛苦的工作和結核舊磨折自己以外，還談得到療養兩個字嗎？這復信想來是他太太寫的。我們並沒有再度通信，那時我也淪於飢餓的邊緣，為了使妻兒免於做餓殍，我弄得身心交瘁，忘了一切，只有書局主持人無意中告訴我，莎翁全集快譯完了，等生豪健康恢復，所剩者已是不多幾本。</p>
<p>遺囑胞弟續成全稿</p>
<p>勝利來臨，天是亮了，大家鬆了一口氣，我重來上海，碰到詹文滸先生。提起生豪兄，他悲愴地說，生豪已於卅三年冬在嘉興病故了，他也是到上海後才從書局方面知道的。這個噩耗使我震驚了好久。書局方面說起，他的譯稿已經在陸續付排，但最後的幾本到底沒有翻完。他遺命囑胞弟文振代為續成。文振在中學時和我同級，也是研究西洋文學的，他一定能够勝任。勝利至今，時將兩年，這三厚册的莎翁全集，終於由書局出版了（第四輯史劇還在譯述中）。對於目前奄奄垂斃的文化界，是一個可喜的消息，但是想到這是一位忠實努力的文人，積十年而成的心血結晶，而他自己未及見其出版，母寧說是極可悲的事情，貧病對於中國文化工作者好像是命定的。如今我看到全第，追念生豪兄，想到自己那時的情形，眞不知涕淚之何從！</p>
<p>生豪兄的太太在本書前寫下這樣的幾句：「他病危時還表示過，早知一病不起，拼着命也要把它譯完……」他不單是一位忠實的文化工作者，簡直是充滿殉道者的精神了。</p>
<h3>中國抗戰畫史</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>曹聚仁　舒宗僑編著　聯合畫報社版</p>
<p>編者說：「這是一部戰爭的記錄」。</p>
<p>戰爭，尤其是中國近一世紀來對日本的抵抗戰鬥，對於每一個中國人都太熟悉了。我們積兩代的時間掙扎於苦難的戰爭激流之中，嚥下了不知多少悽厲的回憶與敎訓；現在時代雖然把歷史帶進了一個新的局面，但是這回憶與敎訓仍然値得我們加以咀嚼的。</p>
<p>這正如編者在篇首引用小羅斯福所說的：「我們所寫的雖是關於戰爭的記錄，但希望由此而閃出增進人類幸福，促成世界和平的光輝」。對於立足在這一種動機上所寫成的戰爭記錄，我們應該給予最崇高的評價；雖然本書從頭至尾，記載着的全是民族的仇恨，國家的血淚，是酷虐，是毀滅；但這些都是人類間醜惡，卑劣，凶殘的人性的一面，在這人性的另一面則是充滿了善良，美麗，與超越小我的協調，我們不必悚懼於這些血肉糢糊的史頁曾經暴露過人類間絕望的悲哀，相反的我們正應該從這一頁一頁用民族的十字架換來的記錄上面，去翻尋侵略者喪失人性的緣由，去理解我們受難的軌跡，從這裏去努力為我們，為子孫，也為人類覓取一個自由，和平的永恒的基石。</p>
<p>編者在第一章「引論」裏就敲起了侵略者的喪鐘。無知地膜拜武士，貪婪地埀涎大陸，十九世紀以來將近六七十年的敎養，纔使他們全體走向侵略中國的行程。編者在這一章裏面所搜集的挿圖顯然不够豐富，愚昧的宮城朝拜，瘋狂的神社祭祀，封建而又猥褻的藝妓舞踊，原始而又刻苦的生活方式，這些都是侵略者勇於赴戰的心理基礎，漏列在職爭的記錄前面至少是一種遺憾。不過有一幀圖片很好，那是富士山下的農村，一個連山脊山麓都要墾為晨田的農村，但是當中夾雜着工廠的烟囪，工業農業已經這般不調和地同時要並存在這塊有限而澆瘠的土地上，你能說田中的「開發大陸」的奏　是由於軍閥們單純的好戰心理嗎？</p>
<p>第二章「日本侵略戰序幕」其實也正是這次第二次世界大戰的序幕，編者客觀地指出了當時環繞在「九一八」以後的國際局勢的演變，他引用希特勒的「國聯乃水面上的蘆葦」一句話說：「當時中國正攀援着這枝蘆葦，期望由此而得救」。是悲憤，也是啓示。在現實之下我們重讀這一章，覺得貝多芬所說的「在暴風雨下向人控訴和乞憐是世界上最笨拙的事情」，是含有無限蒼凉慘痛的意味的。</p>
<p>從第三章到第九章，紀載的是自七七蘆溝橋以來到日本朋潰屈膝為止的一段漫長的悲壯的征途。編者把八年苦戰分為七個時期：由七七至二十六年十二月南京，蕪湖，杭州的戰鬥，二十七年一月至五月間的津浦，魯南，隴海及江南戰鬥，二十七年下半年的武漢會戰及北戰塲的遊擊戰，這三個時期的劃為抗戰第一階段大致是正確的。接着二十七年十一月至二十九年四月的武漢撤退後南昌，長沙，桂南，粵北諸戰役，與二十九年五月至卅年十二月的鄂省，浙閩沿海戰役以至太平洋戰爭爆發前的一段時期，就整個的戰局來說，其實是可以合併的。自卅一年一月太平洋戰爭發生後的大陸戰塲和緬甸地區的戰鬥，以至卅三年十一月抗戰後期的各戰役，似乎可以別於上述兩個時期列為抗戰第三個階段。這裏面所觸及的國際反應，朝野動態，敵偽情况等各種材料，稍嫌簡略，不過關於前後戰役的系統叙述，頗為完備，並且有幾個戰役裏編者似曾身經，所以很有些珍貴的見聞。此中唯一的缺憾是挿圖面積較大，太佔篇幅，有很多可歌可泣，亦悲亦壯的照片都無法配合刋載了。本書名為畫史，其實仍舊是文字佔着主要的份量。</p>
<p>第十章「勝利之頁」在全書中是最簡略的一部份，也許是由於付印時間較早，不及收入大量的資料。但是我們也希望記錄到此為止，一方面讓我們永久瞻憶這本畫册所留下的抗戰偉業的艱苦與莊嚴，一方面也使我們在現實的煩悶之中還能依稀嗅到一點過去那種崇高的芬芳和溫馨。</p>
<p>現在已經有人喊出了「正視戰後的日本」的口號！我們是否能為子孫警惕，消戢未來侵略者給予我們一個更慘烈的迫害呢？我願意竭誠推薦這一本忠實的「抗戰的記錄」，於飽嘗了勝利的榮譽和慰藉的讀者之前。</p>

<p>原作者，是新波蘭的革命者之女，後來她自已也成為一個堅强的革命者，在她底作品裏充沸着嚴肅的，莊重的，質樸而大方的描寫，同時，它又處處表現出豪邁，勇壯，剛毅，樂觀的精神。</p>
<p>她底作品的成功，在文藝界早就有了定評。</p>
<p>關於她的寫作生活，是很早就開始的，中學讀書的年代已寫作抒情詩，但那時很不成功，直至後來她為一個工友遊藝會編寫節目劇本，獲得很大的成果，由此時起，才堅定開始了她的文學工作。</p>
<p>她的生活經騐是豐富的，幼年時代曾與囊夫們在田裏一塊兒工作，深切瞭解農夫們的慘淡生活；在學校時代，正値新波蘭的革命運動浪潮高漲的時代，她在這浪潮中去實際受冲激，更堅固了她底靈魂。在蘇，德戰爭中，她又親身投筆從戎，……她的生活經歷中，是豐足地意識到人民的眞諦。</p>
<p>因此她的作品，活生生地表現出了那些眞實生活的描寫，成為一個寫實主義的現代名作家。</p>
<p>她的第一部著作「日子的面貌」，深刻反映出波蘭下層社會飢寒綫上呻吟，掙扎，苦鬥的一面，後來的「祖國」「大地在苦難中」，「池沼上的火熖」等著作，都是反映社會生活的鏡子。及至「虹」的出版，更轟動了整個文藝界，給文藝界收穫了一顆</p>
<p>「虹」，是作者在戰爭的血火裏，親身去觀察，體騐，思索的結晶。</p>
<p>藝術的文筆上，它是蒼勁，凸出，眞切，感人，一開始就用戲劇性的描寫，緊緊地抓住了讀者。</p>
<p>這部小說（同時也由作者編過一個電影劇本），內容的槪要——即其故事的來源，作者曾對一個訪問者坦白地說出。</p>
<p>「在島瓦洛夫城附近的一個村子裏，有人告訴我一個平常農婦的故事，這農婦的名字呌亞力山德娜·戴麗曼。當德國人佔領了她的村子的時候，她就逃到游擊隊裏，同游擊隊一起去打德國人。最初，她在游擊隊裏燒飯，洗衣，後來就被派出去担任偵察的工作，她常常供給了許多寳貴的情報。部隊裏面，從沒有一個人想到她是懷孕的女子。為了不使人阻止她去担任最重要的工作，她儘可能的隱瞞着自己的懷孕，可是產期逼近了，她就決定回到村裏去。一連三天她都順利的躱過了敵人，可是在第四天就被敵人捉去了。在冰天雪地裏，這個將要生產的女子，被剝成裸體，深夜裏，被德國人趕着在街上走着，呌她指出那些是游擊隊員的家庭。</p>
<p>「早晨的時候，德國兵把她痛打　一頓，就把她關到敞棚裏。她在那兒生了一個兒子。德國人又開始來折磨她，威嚇她，要把她的兒子殺死。她始終頑强的反抗着。最後，德國人惱起來，就把她的兒子殺了，並且把她自己也投到冰河裏。」</p>
<p>接着，作者就報告出她以這個故事作為題材的來源：</p>
<p>「這女人的故事，深深的打動了我的心。我眞被蘇聯婦女們的這種這德上的力量所震服了，在這戰爭期間，我更有機會看到這些婦女的榜樣，在我所寫的這個電影劇本裏面，這位犧牲了的女英雄亞力山德娜，戴麗曼　，是一個主角，這兒改名為娥琳娜。在我描寫這些女英雄的時候，我不藉於任何想像，差不多每一個人物，都是從眞實生活中描繪出來的」。</p>
<p>作者以這樣一個故事做例子，加上她親身的經歷，描寫出了一個英勇的，動人的女英雄的事跡。</p>
<p>通過她熟練的文藝技巧，把這事跡活活地反映了出來。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>這書的中譯本，也是非常成功的，譯者曹靖華先生，譯時很認員，譯筆暢流。原著者也有專電給他：</p>
<p>「親愛的曹靖華先生：我懷着敬慕的心情，注意着你正在完成的偉大的文化工作。我非常高興：連我的著作，在進一步的鞏固國際的文學聯繫上，也能有所貢獻。並向中國的朋友們和文藝界的同仁們，致眞誠的敬意！忠于你的W，瓦希列夫斯卡」。</p>
<p>中譯本的價値，由此更可證明其偉大。</p>
<p>讀了這部著作，可使我們增多了不少戰時見聞，瞭解侵略者的狼心，學習抵抗者的偉大愛國熱情。</p>
<p>我願中國讀者們，都一讀此名著（本書係瓦希列夫斯卡著，曹靖華譯，各大書店經售，定價：一萬六千五百元）</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>聽來的故事：</p>
<p>有一天希特勒帶領着航空部長戈林和宣傳部長戈貝爾，駕着一輛汽車正要經過一道橋，橋中間有一隻驢子擋住了去路。希特勒原想衝過去。但是，那　子的身材相當大，萬一汽車出了亂子，翻下橋去，可不是好玩的。於是這位領袖首先跑到驢子的身邊，發表了一小時長的暴烈的演說，可是，那驢子不聞不問仍然呆在那裏，希特勒埀頭喪氣地回到汽車裏。</p>
<p>「元首；瞧我的。」戈林興匆匆地走到驢子的身邊，高聲地吶喊道：「你這個鬼東西，再不走的話，我馬上派三千架飛機，炸死你這箋鬼東西！」</p>
<p>驢子悠哉悠哉，仍是不動聲色。</p>
<p>最後，戈貝爾很有把握地去了。他抓住驢耳，輕輕說了兩句話，費時不到一分鐘。驢子就不要命似的放開四蹄逃跑了。</p>
<p>元首和戈林都很驚訝地問戈貝爾，究竟是什麽理由使他得到凱旋？</p>
<p>戈貝爾很自然地笑了笑說：「我只是說請牠加入國社黨的一句話而已。」</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「體中黠癡各半」</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>在這個年頭兒，做人眞不容易。你如果偏於懣直呢，人家要笑你痴；你如果偏於機智呢，人家又要駡你黠。痴和黠，都要受批評。於是乎我想起桓溫的妙話來。世說新語中載桓溫謂顧愷之日：「其體中黠痴各半」。陸放翁因之而有一句「人笑黠痴俱得半」的詩。我不相信天下眞有黠痴各得其半的人，誰還眞有那樣橫刀劈成兩半性格嗎？</p>
<p>曹阿瞞是從古第一個刁鑽古怪的鬼靈精，在他幼年假裝中惡風之疾，敗面喎口，給他的屢加訓斥的叔父看，叔父報告他的父親曹嵩，嵩驚而呼阿瞞，則阿瞞固好端端的沒有絲毫病象。嵩問：「叔言汝中風已好了嗎？」阿瞞說：「並未中風，但失愛於叔父，遭惡咒耳。」從此以後，叔再向嵩前言阿瞞的行為如何不端，嵩也就不會相信了。（見三國志魏志。）這便是阿瞞奸詐的開端，此奸詐實為黠之本性所自出。這一種「黠」，發展開去，便是大奸　，當然是不好的。</p>
<p>可是有時為了自衛以免禍，黠又是少不得的。也是三國時代的一件事：「賈詡敗過沂，道遇叛氏，同行數十人，皆為所執，詡曰，我段公外甥也，汝別埋之，我家必厚贖之。時太尉段穎昔久為邊將，威震西土，故詡以懼氏。氐果不敢言，與盟而送之，其餘悉死，詡實非段甥，權以濟事，咸此類也。（見後漢書）。</p>
<p>這也是一種黠，但是無害於義的黠，可恕的黠，雖然說的是誑，但並非罪，因出於不得已而自衛之故。如果黠是可以有的話，我們寗可取賈詡的黠而不取曹阿瞞的那種黠。</p>
<p>痴的例子很多，古人謂愚忠愚孝，今人也多贊美麗直而菲薄聰明，可惜能實行的人究竟少。明哲保身，虛與委蛇，對於一切不合理的事，仍是不敢言，不敢駡，甚至守口如瓶，因循妥協，社會上事因此而不能有進步明朗的徵象。</p>
<p>路見不平，拔刀相助，是一種戇氣，也便是一種痴氣，痴戇是不可少的品格，沒有痴戇的人出來幹，天下事便畏此不平下去，而且將變本加厲的暗無天日了，歷史上像漢朝汲黯那樣有名的痴戀的人也並不多，朱雲之「願賜尙方斬馬劍，砍佞臣一人頭」，後來且「攀折殿檻」，也算痴　得可以了，雖然並無救於漢姓的衰微，總還不失其為忠，不失其為戇，比較自私自利只顧個人享受的長樂老和鄕愿們總算堅强得多了。</p>
<p>假如說，「黠痴各得其半」的話可以成立，我是寗願人們的「痴」能多於「黠」的。換句話說，便是與其失之「黠」。不如失之「痴」。</p>
<h3>慈幼養老</h3>
<p>— 黑子</p>
<p>如有攷據癖，則對於敬老尊責是頗能例舉史實說其本為古風的。近聞本市當局擬具敬老尊賢辦法，將組一敬老尊賢委員會，策劃敬老尊賢事宜。何謂「老」，何謂「賢」，據說也已經有了定義，凡是本市市民年齡在七十歲以上，品行端正者謂之老人。德高望重，年齡在五十歲以上有著作，或事業足資矜式，堪為市民表率者謂之賢者。前者普查，後者由區民代表薦舉，這倒確是一件「德」政。</p>
<p>對老人之敬，對賢者之尊，這自然不容猶疑，這種寓褒貶於敬老尊賢的運動，也許策劃其事者是希望裨益於世道人心，提高社會道德的。</p>
<p>本來，「人生七十古來稀」，尤其在這「擠」「亂」的都市裏，能够在細菌，污穢，戰亂與貧困中活下七十年，也確屬最為堅靱的生命，値得旣敬且佩的。至於德高望重的賢者，旣有事業足資矜式，堪為市民表率，大概近乎社會「聞人」，恐怕也早已被尊而崇之了。與此相若，老而彌健，大致是有個好環境的，那未兒孫成羣，已早是旣敬且孝了。</p>
<p>所以與其敬老尊賢，倒不如慈幼養老，更有意義了。語云：幼吾幼以及人之幼，老吾老以及人之老，慈幼養老實在比敬老　賢更有無量功德，更為實際。尤其在此老而垂斃於潮盤，幼者乞食於街頭，在比比皆是的今天，慈幼養老實屬迫切，對他們的衣食予以救濟，是無論如何比對老人賢者之開會公宴，送匾和饒物，有較多的價値。在「老人」，在「賢者」，榮譽以外再予榮譽，即不認為多事，也不見得會重視多少。而慈幼養老，則身受其惠者必然是感德無涯，銘心勿忘了。</p>
<p>故在當局計　「敬老尊賢」之時，我們極願引其注意，且先「慈幼養老」吧，親愛的先生！</p>
<h3>「胎敎」　亂世懷古錄之一</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>有幾句名言是：「窮人的孩子，蓬頭垢面在街上轉，闊人的孩子妖形妖勢，嬌聲嬌氣的在家裏轉，都昏天黑地的在社會轉，同他們的父母一樣，「或者還不如」。（見「熱風」）後輩同前輩一樣或甚至「不如」，世界自然更不像樣，而人心也就愈趨於「慕古」了，所以應該想個辦法來挽回頹勢，以便讓社會中的七斤太太多起來，九斤小姐少下去。這辦法在文具店老　是：大家都用毛筆，「國粹乃得不亡」；在專治白濁的藥丸發明者則是：大家應吞白濁丸，患者可治，未患者可預防，「民愈强，國愈有望也」；此外如學究，敎授，名流，官僚……都開過不少的方單，而且都自信，非如此不可」，伹不幸得很，方單多，人心亂，孩子們終於還在國團轉，甚至，比前更「不如」了。今年三四月間普善山莊所掩埋焚化的街頭童屍特多，便是明證。</p>
<p>「養你，育你，有功於你·」孩子自然照例得屬於養育者，無從抗議。因為，向更強者，孱頭們是不取抽刃相向的，唯獨對於孩子們，他們却特別勇敢，或瞪眼，或怒吼，或鞭打，皆無不可。魯迅先生在「上海的兒童」一文中說：「中國的中流家庭，敎孩子大抵只有兩種方法」這所謂「兩種方法」，一，敎孩子做網中的蜘蛛；二，敎孩子做籠中的小島。蜘蛛結網稱覇，小禽婉囀可愛，但離開網與籠，却都變成了和其養育者一樣的孱頭了。</p>
<p>這使我們更想起古之人的厚道來了吧？是的，但做古之人實在也不很容易，身為太子，雖在胎裏，已得令其母吃如下的苦頭</p>
<p>「王后腹之七月而就宴室，太史銅而御戶左，太宰持斗而御戶右，太卜持耆龜而御堂下，諸官皆以其職御其內。比沒三月者，王后所求聲音非禮樂，則太史缊瑟而稱不習；所求滋味者非正味，則太宰依斗而不敢煎調，而言曰：「不敢以待王太子。」太子生而泣，太史吹銅曰：「聲中某律」，太宰曰：「滋味上某」。太卜曰：「命之某」。然後為太子懸弧之體。……（大戴禮記保傳篇）</p>
<p>正如此這般的胎敎下，王后只好吃方方正正的肉，踏方方正正步履，睡方方正正的覺，惝一下小心，人家便會用未來的太子來請她「好自珍　」，我想，太子出腹而無恙，是乃王后　行所致；不然，王后還得吃　甚的苦頭也說不定。至於太子本身，當然益發苦不堪言。連哭聲也不大自然的，「保傳篇」中尚有如下的文句。</p>
<p>「古者年八歲而出就外舍，學小藝焉，覆小節焉！束髮而就大學，學大藝焉，履大節焉。居則寶禮文，行則鳴珮王，升車則和鸞之聲，是以非僻之心無以入也。……」</p>
<p>非僻之心，蓋即「邪念」耳，習禮文·鳴佩玉·意思也是要他「厚道」一點也。倘使能够變成一塊呆木頭，自然更好，用「何不食肉糜」來答覆小民的高喊肚子餓，這就是古來帝王的典型</p>
<p>大家都覺得團團轉較諸席地呆坐，實在壤得多，其原因也許就是胎敎未興，禮儀失軌之故。所以要孩子寗靜得像個樣子，辦法是有的，照「禮記」中所載行去便好了。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽團</p>
<p>美國無痰盂考</p>
<p>初到美國的人，鑒於吐痰無盂，感到相當不方便，因而想向市肆購痰孟一只，可是踏破鐵鞋無覓處，美國人根本不知痰孟為何物，難怪在孫中山時代，有一位老牌外交家當參加盛大宴會之時，忽然濃痰上昇，一時情急，祇得把玻璃盃暫作痰盂一用。美國人也一樣咳，一樣吐痰，但並不隨　吐痰，而是擇地吐痰。在公路上散步，照樣可以看到美國人在吐痰，甚至小便，而且女性也有在公路邊小便的，不過由同行女伴圍成肉屏風遮羞而已。</p>
<p>他們吐痰的地方是抽水馬桶和洗面瓷缸，却從來不曾看見有人把痰吐在手帕內的，這是高等華人的作風。美國女子隨身帶了克令匿克司（薄紗紙），這種克令匿克司的用塲極大，可當手帕用，可當粉撲用，可當手紙用，也可用來吐痰。克令匿克司每匣是美金一角，軍營商店祇售七分錢，比用棉花或手帕便宜得多，因為克令匿克司的便宜，女性把牠用來擦皮鞋及吐痰，我國中國太需要克令匿克司了，你在北四川路或南京路外灘走過，滿地是痰，幾乎成為痰世界，竟有無從涉足之處，市政局當似應派出大批淸道夫，每日舉行掃痰運動，根絕辦法還在淸火消痰，大氣夫重，痰疾難免。（九）</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>夢的科學（四）</h3>
<p>— 顧均正</p>
<p>兒童的夢是怎樣的？</p>
<p>兒童的夢簡單而率真，不大有象徵的意味，因為兒童不需要偽裝他的內在的慾望。但是當他到了十多歲的時候，他就漸漸有檢查其內在情感的傾向，於是他的夢也變得差不多和成年人一樣地富於象徵的意味了。</p>
<p>兒童的夢往往是看見他們的父母，做游戲，吃喜歡的東西，得到贈品，或為動物所追逐。</p>
<p>瞎子在夢裏看見東西嗎？</p>
<p>完全可以看見，除非他天生是個瞎子。天生是瞎眼的人，其所作的夢主要都根據觸覺，不大有視覺的夢。但是也有少數例子，可以見物，不過他們所看見的全是些沒有具體形象的東西，通常都屬夢魘性質。</p>
<p>科學能窺探他人的夢嗎？</p>
<p>可以的。紐約大學瑪克思敎授（Prof.L.W.Max）普經研究過聾啞者的夢。聾啞者是用手語的。他們在做夢的時候，動着手指，有時候往往表示出完全的語言，因此一個懂得手語的人站在旁邊，真的能追隨在他們的夢境裏。</p>
<p>夢能預言未來嗎？</p>
<p>有些權威學者承認有所謂「先知」夢的存在。不過其中也有好許多學說，最盛行的解　是涉及所謂特別感覺這個現象的。據說有些人具有一種天賦，可以不藉五官的作用來讀書或　　事物。</p>
<p>然而多數的權威學者對於這種所謂先知夢，却取懷疑的態度。大心理學家阿特勒（AirxodAdler）研究許多貌似先知夢的實例，他發見得夢的人一律在一種心情不安的狀態之下，他相信這心情的不安，就使他們夢見所耽心的事情已經發生了。其他的懷疑論者相信這樣的夢大者是偶合的，有成千成萬的人在做著未來事情的夢，其中偶然有若干人的夢與實際的遭遇相符合。那是自然不過的事情。（完）</p>

<h3>Meritorious Military Service in the Siping Campaign Will Be Investigated and Rewarded by the National Government; Bamiancheng and Guojadian Recovered Successively</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Government issued an order on July 2nd: The purpose of our country's eight-year war of resistance was to defend our territory, recover the Northeast, and maintain the integrity of our sovereignty and territory. Unexpectedly, since the victory, the communist bandits Zhu Mao and others have betrayed the country and poisoned the people, deliberately obstructing our national army from taking over the Northeast territory and sovereignty, and repeatedly harassed and disturbed us. In recent days, they have launched large-scale offensives in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Near Siping, they concentrated ten times the defending army's strength to continuously attack, and their offensive was particularly fierce. Our defending army, the 71st Corps under the command of Army Commander Chen Mingren, united with the local officials and people, fought bravely, disregarding their own lives, and defended heroically. After eighteen days and nights of bloody battle, they advanced wave after wave, repeatedly thwarting the stubborn offensive. Our two-way reinforcement armies advanced in successive battles, attacking from both inside and outside, and finally eliminated the ferocious enemy on the morning of June 30, lifting the heavy siege. The violence was quelled, and the rebellious plot was thwarted. The important town of the Northeast stood tall and upright. The great righteousness of the nation and the country has since been as clear as the sun and stars. The meritorious deeds of suppressing the rebellion and pacifying the insurgents will soon be accomplished with ease. Without generous rewards, how can we encourage loyalty and merit? It is ordered that the Northeast Headquarters quickly issue commendations to all the officers, soldiers, officials, and people who participated in the defense and rescue of Siping. At the same time, investigate and verify the facts of their meritorious deeds, and report them separately for awards and commendations. The military and civilians who died should be given preferential treatment and pensions to show our condolences and to encourage others. This order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] Li Bailin, Deputy Commander of the 5th Regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Detachment of the National Army, bravely advanced in the sweeping battle of Changnan, capturing many enemies. Commander Du recently issued a hand-written commendation and recorded a major merit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Capital Comforting Committee for the National Army believes that the National Army's relief of Siping has had a significant impact on the entire Northeast war situation. In addition to submitting a donation of 100 million yuan to the central government for distribution, it also sent a telegram of condolence.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 2nd] The northern troops of the National Army's right-wing force yesterday recovered Bamiancheng on the Pingqi Railway line. The communist army suffered extremely heavy casualties. It is reported that their First and Second Columns were protecting those retreating from Bamiancheng. The left-wing troops of the National Army yesterday recovered Banlashanmen, southeast of Siping. The fighting on the Pingmei Railway line was fierce. In addition, the air force took advantage of the bright moonlight one day and night to conduct a raid. Communist army vehicles were found on the road near Bamiancheng. One bomb was dropped, hitting the target directly. The sound of the explosion suddenly rose, and the bright moonlight was almost obscured by thick smoke.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 2nd] The center of gravity of the battle on the north bank of the Liao River is near Yitong. The National Army's pincer attack will achieve great results. It seems difficult for the remaining communists in that area to escape their fate of defeat. In addition, 5,000 to 6,000 communist troops who fled west of Taojiatun and Daheilinzi in Changnan, retreated to Huaide with injuries. The National Army is currently advancing towards Huaide.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] Military News: (1) The National Army's southward corps recovered Guojadian, 50 li south of Gongzhuling, at 3:00 p.m. on the 1st. The vanguard troops also crossed Ershijiazi, sweeping away the communist troops who had fled near Heshu. Another unit is pressing towards Yitong County. (2) The National Army's powerful corps is now clearing the remaining communist troops along the Huaide-Dayushu highway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd] After the communist army's disastrous defeat on the outskirts of Siping Street, the main force has fled in the direction of Liaoyuan and Xi'an. The remaining troops are preventing the National Army from pursuing in the northeast of Kaiyuan in order to cover the escape of their main force. A certain powerful unit of the National Army has joined forces with the communist army there, and fierce fighting has been going on for a day and a night. A major annihilation battle should take place there within days.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingren Reports to Reporters on the Defense of the City</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd] General Chen Mingren reported to a group of Chinese and foreign reporters on the 2nd about the defense of Siping, which lasted for one hour. He briefly stated: Siping has been under heavy attack by the communist army since May 21st, and fierce fighting immediately broke out in the southeastern highlands. Our army calmly held firm, and the communist army repeatedly failed in its attacks. It then attacked south along the Middle East Railway line. On June 11th, the communist army once again spied on Siping, concentrating the strength of twelve divisions, four brigades, and one artillery division to launch a fierce attack on our airfield area. On the evening of the 14th, the communist army concentrated artillery fire to bombard the urban area and surrounding positions, firing more than 20,000 shells. At night, they broke into the urban area from the southwest corner, spreading rapidly. Our defending army launched fierce street battles with them. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. The communist army even formed a human shield with corpses. Their brutal behavior was appalling. On the night of the 15th, the communist army attempted to open a second gap in the southwest corner. Our army bravely fought back, and the communist bandits retreated after leaving behind more than a thousand corpses. From the 21st, the communist army again broke into the east of the road, rushing forward at any cost, attempting to resolve the Siping battle before our reinforcements arrived. Our army firmly defended the strongholds, resisting resolutely. Every wall and every house was a must-contested place. On the 24th, the Zhongxing Grain Depot and Alcohol Factory east of the road were successively lost. On the 28th, the communist army reinforced the 18th Division and launched a fierce attack throughout the night, but ultimately failed. On the 29th, the communist army knew that reinforcements were about to arrive and that the situation was dire, but they still attempted to make a final stand. We counterattacked with all our strength, and the communist army suffered heavy casualties and retreated westward. Our army then launched an attack at dawn on the 30th, clearing the remaining enemies and recovering the streets west of the road and the airfield. General Chen stated: In this battle, the communist army fired a total of 100,000 shells and suffered a total of more than 50,000 casualties. More than 2,000 prisoners were captured, including Japanese and Korean people. There were more than 1,000 light machine guns, more than 100 heavy machine guns, and countless other ammunition and weapons.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bamiancheng, 2nd] As a result of the relief of Siping, first, Shenyang, Changchun, and Yongji were all relieved of the siege and stood in a proactive position, extending their iron fists to hammer the fleeing remnants of the enemy. Second, the Shenchang and Changji railway lines were restored. The National Army went east to capture the escaping communists, and Meihekou was in sight. The Northeast war situation, due to the victory in Siping, has generally returned to the situation before May 10th.</p>
<h3>The Great Disaster of Siping Street; It Will Take Fifty Years to Restore to Its Original State</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 2nd] This reporter stayed in Siping for two days and saw General Chen Mingren leading the remaining cadres and soldiers to repair the fortifications to prevent the communist army from coming again. When I left Siping to return to Shenyang at noon on the 2nd, I could still smell the burnt odor in the high sky. The painful impression never left my mind. The following is a miscellaneous record of my observations on this trip.</p>
<p>(1) Siping after the disaster is still shrouded in black smoke. Soybeans are burning, and the fire is raging. The sound of hand grenades and gunfire rises and falls. After the war stopped, the military and civilians cleared the battlefield, but the dead bodies could not be buried quickly enough.</p>
<p>(2) The stench of rotting corpses and the mixed odor of soybean oil smoke made people sick. The streets are burning, and it is impossible to move the corpses. The Shenyang sanitation team has arrived and is preparing to start disinfection and epidemic prevention work.</p>
<p>(3) The people who spent more than ten days of hardship in the cellars of their homes have just calmed their shocked souls. The military and political authorities opened up the soybean burning area on the 2nd, allowing people to move and take away the unburned soybeans near the fire. Men, women, old, and children competed to load and eat them in the smoke and gunfire.</p>
<p>(4) Most of the people in the suburbs fled and returned, supporting the old and carrying the young. The situation was extremely difficult. After returning, most of them placed their belongings among the tiles, preparing to live on. Currently, Siping is completely destroyed except for the northeast corner of the line east area.</p>
<p>(5) Chairman Liu Handong said: Ten counties and three banners in Liaobei Province have suffered this catastrophe. They have been successively recovered, and the need for relief is urgent. The Northeast Headquarters allocated 30 million yuan in circulating notes for emergency relief to Siping on the 2nd, so that the returning people could have food and shelter.</p>
<p>(6) About 100,000 tons of soybeans and sorghum were piled up beside the Middle East Railway. Only 30% to 40% were not burned. Mr. Liu concluded with a heavy tone: This great disaster in Siping will take fifty years to restore Siping to its original state.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Enters Decisive Battle Stage</h3>
<p>Qingdao National Army Coordinates Attack</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] Shandong Province has entered the stage of full-scale decisive battle. The National Army has launched a general offensive, leaving the communist army with no way to escape. Wang Yaowu's troops along the Jiaoji Railway launched a full-scale attack on the 2nd to coordinate with the great battle in the Yimeng Mountain area. (1) The Qingdao National Army launched attacks in the north and west directions on the 2nd, recovering Dongshengjizhuang, northeast of Lingshan and Lancun. (2) The National Army of Chu County recovered Muhushan and Nigushan on the morning of the 2nd, only eight kilometers east of Linyi. (3) The National Army dispatched from Jinan continued to advance in separate routes near Shaoyangguan, east of Zhangqiu and Pujiji.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Linyi, 2nd] The bloody battle in the Yishan area is in full swing. Donglidian has become a tug-of-war situation. The bloody battle in Yue Village is also fierce. The communist army that sneaked southwest of Yishui and southeast of Mengyin, attempting to encircle the rear of the National Army, has been surrounded by the National Army and will not be difficult to annihilate in the Tianma Mountain area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] The main force of the communist army in the Yimeng Mountain area has been dismembered by the National Army and trapped in three encirclements, which can be annihilated.</p>

<h3>Sun Lianzhong Goes to the Front Line</h3>

<h3>Communist Cadre Wang Minqiang Surrenders in Tianjin After Arriving from Cang County</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] On July 1st, Wang Minqiang, a communist cadre from Cang County, surrendered to the local police station. Before he set off for Tianjin, he was forced by the communist army to kill his grandmother to show his loyalty. When he surrendered, he stated that when the communist army attacked Cang County, he was the commander of the Xiaonanmen in the county. Because he could not bear to see his hometown elders die in the artillery fire, he did not actively fight and was once detained. Recently, he was sent to Tianjin to organize people's welfare societies to engage in intelligence work. When he was forced to personally kill his grandmother, it was on the eve of his departure to Tianjin. After arriving in Tianjin, in view of the communist army's brutality, he voluntarily surrendered to atone for his previous sins.</p>
<h3>The Economic Commission's Plenary Review Meeting Discusses Economic Reform Plans; The Sixth Meeting Is Postponed and Will Continue the Review Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Economic Commission held a plenary review meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 2nd to review the "Economic Reform Plan" proposed by President Zhang. It lasted for four hours, and there was heated debate on the points of developing human resources, increasing production, increasing materials, and stabilizing prices. The review meeting will be reopened on the 3rd. The 6th meeting of the Economic Commission, originally scheduled to be held on the 3rd, will be postponed.</p>
<p>The review meeting on the 2nd was chaired by Xu Kan. When discussing agricultural loans, industrial loans, and export loans, there was intense debate. According to the original proposal, these types of loans should be based on the principles of large amounts and universality, with the aim of promoting rice. Wheat. Cotton. Bean and flour. Gauze. Oil · Sugar · Fuel and other production, and use a part of the discussion results to make corrections. Currently, it is not within the national financial capacity to talk about large-scale universal loans, and there is a risk of causing inflation. When Chen Lifu explained, he believed that this type of loan would not cause inflation, because the loan would be enough to increase production, and in the future, the repayment would be made in kind. This is an important point in the plan, so it is appropriate to maintain the original plan. Other committee members believed that this method had the following drawbacks: (1) Before production increases, malicious inflation occurs first; (2) Cunning merchants use loans to engage in other speculations; (3) They deliberately delay repayment or pay with inferior products.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Industrial and Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>As a result of the debate, future loans will be based on the principles of conditional, partial, and restricted. During the meeting, when discussing the government's plan to supply and distribute daily necessities to officers, soldiers, public educators, and workers in production factories first, Chen Lifu explained that there would be no difficulty in supply. Other committee members believed that there might not be enough time, so the result was corrected. It was decided to first supply cities with higher prices and more civil servants. Regarding the issue of stabilizing the value of the currency, according to the original plan, there were three measures: (1) Quickly dispose of enterprises that do not need to be operated by the state, sell enemy and puppet industries and surplus materials, and reorganize tax revenue to make up for the financial deficit in the short term and prevent inflation. (2) The government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the currency system so that it can gradually return to normal. (3) The currency systems of the three places of Northeast, Taiwan, and Xinjiang must be reorganized at the same time to make them consistent. There was discussion about this during the meeting. Then, the reform of the financial system was discussed. According to the original plan, the reform of the financial system must pay special attention to serving the national economic policy and increasing agricultural and industrial production as the main purpose. Financial institutions should each have their own main specialized business, and it was decided to use the county as the grassroots institution of the financial system to support the establishment of county banks to facilitate construction and cooperate with the promotion of local autonomy. The county bank should be based on the principle of one bank per county. After Chen Lifu explained, Pan Xulun and others objected, believing that if the plan was followed, there would be more than 2,000 county banks, which would be too many. Three amendments were proposed at the meeting: (1) The Agricultural Bank and the Cooperative Treasury should establish branches in necessary locations. (2) The provincial bank should establish branches in important areas. (3) After the county bank is established, the provincial bank will be cancelled. None of these three opinions were passed at the meeting. The meeting did not adjourn until 7:30 p.m. The review meeting will be reopened on the 3rd to continue the discussion. Also, some committee members at the review meeting on the 2nd believed that the economic reform plan included too much and involved too much. It is better to select urgent and easy-to-implement ones and organize them first.</p>
<h3>The Central Political Committee Discusses Military and Diplomatic Affairs; Comforts Various Units in Siping; The Xinjiang Incident Prompts a Second Protest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The Central Political Committee held its seventh meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 2nd. Dai Chuanxian attended the meeting. Chen Cheng and Wang Shijie made military and diplomatic reports. After listening to the reports, the committee members immediately decided (1) that the troops under the command of Army Commander Chen Mingren, who firmly defended Siping, and the various troops that reinforced and joined forces to relieve the siege, disregarded their own lives and fought bravely, which was worthy of commendation, and it was decided to send a telegram of condolence. (2) Regarding the Beitashan incident, the Soviet reply did not match the facts, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should file a second protest, stating that Beitashan is our country's territory. Chen Cheng's military report focused on the battle of Siping. He said that the victory in Siping had improved the military situation in the Northeast and greatly boosted morale. However, because the communist army had looted the food from the surrounding counties, and our military and political cooperation was not close enough, there were difficulties in terms of supplies. In terms of the overall situation of suppressing the communists militarily, the focus besides the war in the Northeast is on Shandong. If a decisive victory is won in central Shandong, the overall situation will improve. Wang Shijie's diplomatic report analyzed the international situation in detail, especially focusing on the United States' decision on foreign policy. Because the United States is conducting a survey of domestic resources for the purpose of assisting Europe and relieving East Asia, it seemed to focus on Europe in the past, but judging from the recent lifting of the arms embargo, it seems that it has also focused on East Asia. We hope that the United States can have a clear plan and expression before the foreign ministers' meeting in August. Regarding the Xinjiang incident, Wang also continued to report. The reports submitted by the three small groups of the Central Political Committee, namely internal affairs, diplomacy, and military affairs, were submitted for discussion at the same time. The report stated that Xinjiang geography and Beitashan belong to Xinjiang. During Sheng Shicai's rule in Xinjiang, a gold mining bureau was established in the Ashan area. The bureau hired Soviet advisors. If Beitashan was not under the jurisdiction of Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang Province would not be able to establish a bureau in the area to mine gold. This is very clear. At the meeting, it was decided to submit a second protest and hand it over to the relevant authorities for implementation.</p>
<p>Responsible Parties Should Be Responsible for the Smooth Transportation of Materials in the Northeast</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Northeast resources, the committee members questioned the Northeast Economic Commission a lot. They all believed that the Northeast has abundant resources of coal and soybean production. In the past, the Soviet army and the communist army smuggled exports and extracted foreign exchange, but we felt it was difficult to transport them out. It is a pity that abundant products were abandoned on the ground. The responsible parties should be ordered to investigate the responsibility and transport them as smoothly as possible. The meeting also passed two personnel transfer cases: (1) Weng Jingtang was internally appointed as the chairman of the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee; (2) Zheng Zhenyu, the political deputy of the Ministry of Land Affairs, was approved to resign, and Tang Huisun, the current administrative deputy, was internally appointed to fill the position. Zhu Ding was the candidate for the administrative deputy. The above personnel transfers will be submitted to the State Council for discussion. As for the issue of the number of legislators from professional groups, it was brought up again on the 2nd. Most of the committee members advocated restoring the number of 112 that was passed before the State Council meeting. The previous resolution of the Legislative Yuan was 84. This is only a suggestion, and the decision-making power still lies with the State Council. It should be submitted to the State Council and request that the original proposal be maintained and passed according to 112.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Has Notified Our Government That It Will Send Overseas Chinese Back to Their Country</h3>
<p>Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] At the press conference of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan on the 2nd, when asked how the Chinese government viewed the importance of the Soviet Union's decision to repatriate 3,000 households of overseas Chinese living in major cities in China, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that some time ago, the Soviet government repatriated a batch of Russian overseas Chinese from the Northeast, and everyone must remember this matter. This time, the Soviet government intends to transport back another batch, including about 150 orphans. The Soviet government has notified our government of this intention, and our government will provide the necessary convenience to Russian overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd] Tianjin Soviet Deputy Consul Du Ruofeiyefu declared that the Tianjin Soviet Consulate had transferred orders from the Nanjing Embassy regarding the repatriation of Soviet overseas Chinese in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai.

<h3>Some White Russians in Beiping Are Willing to Naturalize in Our Country</h3>
<p>The Soviet Consulate Handles the Reinstatement of White Russian Nationality</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] The Soviet Consulate in this area has begun to handle the registration of White Russians who are allowed to obtain Soviet nationality and return to their country.

It is understood that there are more than 1,000 White Russians in Beiping, most of whom work for others or do business. Only some of them have obtained Soviet nationality, while the rest insist on White Russian integrity, do not join Soviet nationality, and maintain their stateless status. Some even request to naturalize in China in order to avoid joining Soviet nationality.</p>
<h3>The General Order to Arrest Mao Zedong Is Purely of a Judicial Nature; Interview with the Prosecutor-General of the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] After the Supreme Court Procuratorate issued an order to all courts to arrest Mao Zedong, people across the country attached great importance to it. This reporter recently visited Zheng Lie, the Prosecutor-General of the court, to inquire whether the motive for arresting Mao Zedong this time was only as stated in the order, or whether it had a political nature. He replied: "This move is purely of a judicial nature, because the Criminal Law has a special chapter on the crime of internal disorder. Mao Zedong is trying to subvert the government, and his crime of internal disorder is known to everyone. Recently, he has even colluded with Korean communists and used Japanese prisoners to harm the motherland. If he is not arrested, then what is the point of me being the Prosecutor-General of the country? Furthermore, the head of the Gansu High Court has filed a request for investigation, so how can I put it aside and ignore it?" The reporter continued to ask whether other communist personnel would also be arrested. Zheng replied: "Although I am a believer in the Three Principles of the People, in order to respect the freedom of thought of others, I will never interfere with those who believe in communism and operate within the scope of the law. But the so-called Chinese Communist Party today, first, intends to subvert the government, and no country can tolerate this situation. Second, it possesses a large military force to confront the government, which is unprecedented for foreign communist parties. Third, although it is crowned with the two characters of China, its actions have actually wiped out these two characters and "called others father," fearing that China will not perish. If this can be tolerated, then weren't our previous efforts to resist Japan superfluous? However, because there are too many members of the rebellious party, we should make every effort to suppress them. Arresting their leaders is enough to correct the public's view."</p>

<h3>Disregarding the Lives and Property of Tens of Millions: Communist Army Obstructs Yellow River Repair and Defense, Lu Re-Embankment Employees Withdraw, Situation Critical</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 2nd] The actions of the Chinese Communists in destroying the Yellow River repair and defense agreement have been confirmed by the authorities here. According to reports received by the Ministry of Water Resources, Liu Bocheng's Communist troops crossed the river stealthily on the night of June 30th, numbering over 20,000. By the afternoon of the 30th, Communist troops north of the Yellow River below Huangkou had generally crossed the river, a critical situation. The work sections east of Linpu Township were all seized. The employees of the Lu Repair and Defense Office in Linpu and Caozhou withdrew in batches to Heze on the morning of the 30th. Director Kong of that office led 60 employees, carrying important documents, to Bian. Zhukou and Zhonggudui also cannot proceed with construction. Over a hundred employees are still there, unable to withdraw. On June 29th, Communist troops from Juye and Dongping infiltrated to Xinxian and the northeast of Youcheng, numbering several thousand. All the people's embankments began martial law. Contact with the employees in Zhonggudui and other places has been cut off. The project east of Linpu cannot proceed, and the Zhukou Dongzhuang section project is also greatly affected. The National Army is currently suppressing and blocking them. The main force of Liu Bocheng's troops is now assembled on the opposite bank of Huaixian and Fanxian. Communist sentry posts on the north bank of Liuzhuang in Hebei Province are constantly firing shots. On the morning of the 29th, employees of the Second Stone Dam were continuously shot at while working. In the afternoon, employees were shot at again while inspecting materials. All employees are desperately working at risk. On the morning of July 1st, the Dongzhuang project employees in the Linhuaiji section were attacked by Communist troops and have withdrawn to Caozhou. It is said that Communist troops have reached the side of the highway between Huangkou, Linhuai, and Heze, and traces of Communist troops have been found. Therefore, the Yellow River repair and defense work has been completely obstructed, and the agreement negotiated in Heze on June 21st has also been torn up. The agreement stipulated that re-embankment employees on both sides should not engage in military or political activities and guaranteed the safety of employees on both sides. Unexpectedly, the Communist army pretended to negotiate on one hand, and on the other hand, secretly sent a large army to cross the river to harass the area. The lives and property of tens of millions of people along the river will inevitably suffer significant losses this year.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the urgent need for the lower Yellow River re-embankment project, the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) consulted with the government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to cease military actions along the Yellow River. The government has repeatedly expressed its agreement and has begun emergency repairs on the south bank of the Yellow River. However, the CCP disregarded the lives of the people and took the opportunity to cross the river south to commit offenses. According to relevant sources, the government authorities and the UNRRA have not yet received a formal response from the CCP regarding the re-embankment project as of today. It is also learned that after the Communist army committed the offense, the Executive Yuan Relief Committee had not received reports on the safety of the engineering personnel in the re-embankment area as of the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Yanzhou Dispatch of the 2nd] The over 10,000 troops of Liu Bocheng's army, who stealthily crossed the Yellow River from western Shandong and destroyed the agreement to cease military actions on both banks, have been blocked by the National Army in the Dongkou Linpuji area and are currently engaged in battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 2nd] After Liu Bocheng's Communist troops stealthily crossed the Yellow River from Dongkou on the evening of the 30th, their subsequent troops continued to cross south overnight, reaching 20,000 by noon on the 1st. One force advanced south towards Beiwangzhao, and another advanced east towards Youcheng. The situation in those two places is unclear. All the dike repair workers and civilians have been captured.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Responds to Cleveland, Declares Government's Position: If the CCP Truly Ceases Hostilities, the Government Can Issue a Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng responded on the 1st to the letter of June 19th from Cleveland, Director of the UNRRA Office in China, regarding the Yellow River re-embankment project, declaring the government's position. If the CCP truly ceases all hostilities in the designated areas and time frame, the government can issue a ceasefire order, and the government will provide definite protection for the personnel, materials, and equipment of the Yellow River dike repair project on both banks. According to Mr. Cleveland's letter to Chief of Staff Chen, in addition to the above point, he also inquired whether the Chinese government believed that the expansion of the recent Kuomintang-Communist war in several locations was not contradictory to the goals of UNRRA's work in China. He also inquired about how to protect the safety of UNRRA personnel traveling to Communist areas or materials and equipment transported to Communist areas, among other issues. Chief of Staff Chen's response also included the following three main points: (1) The Chinese government's military measures are purely to quell the rebellion in order to restore peace to the country as soon as possible and reduce the suffering of the people. UNRRA's work in China aims to relieve the Chinese people after the war and assist the government in handling the aftermath. Although difficulties may be encountered during implementation, they can be overcome through communication and cooperation. The goals of the two sides are very consistent. (2) In order to avoid errors, the National Army hopes to be notified in advance of the dates and locations of material shipments and arrivals, and it is hoped that the Ministry of National Defense will be notified as much as possible one week in advance of the markings on ships, vehicles, and houses, so that they are clear. Liaison should be rapid and accurate, so that difficulties and errors can be avoided. (3) Regarding the order to all troops to do their utmost to protect the safety of UNRRA-related materials and personnel, the government has repeatedly issued orders and will do so again in the future if necessary. Chief of Staff Chen also stated at the end of the letter that regarding General Edgerton's suggestion to establish a five-person committee in Linpuji, it could be established immediately, and two government representatives would be assigned. The committee could set up an office in Zhangqiuji to meet the same needs on the north bank of the Yellow River. Finally, he reiterated his deep concern for concentrating all efforts to expedite the re-embankment project before the Yellow River flood season.</p>

<h3>Over Two Hundred Water Pumps Transported to Jiangsu and Zhejiang for Irrigation</h3>
<p>[By Our Correspondent] On the 29th of last month, UNRRA transported 256 water pumps for agricultural irrigation to various locations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Water pumps with diameters of 4 and 12 inches will be used in six counties in Zhejiang Province. Some large water pumps will be used to pump water from small islands in the Yangtze River and flooded farmland around Gaoyou and Baoying. Smaller diameter water pumps will be used to irrigate rice paddies.</p>
<p>All water pumps were transported to various locations along with diesel engines. Each pump is equipped with 20 feet of rubber hose and 40 feet of iron pipe. The 12-inch diameter water pumps use 35-40 horsepower diesel engines and can pump 5,000 gallons of water per minute.</p>
<p>The above water pumps will be sold by the Executive Yuan Relief Committee to farmers or farmers' cooperatives. At the same time, personnel from both the Executive Yuan Relief Committee and UNRRA will jointly provide guidance on how to use and install the machines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, UNRRA plans to transport 9,000 water pumps with diameters ranging from 2 to 12 inches to China in accordance with its plan to revitalize Chinese agriculture, so that they can be used for agricultural irrigation and increase agricultural production.</p>

It is said that there is a severe shortage of plough cattle, which is affecting production. Are there any relief measures planned?

The ministry has dispatched 17 specialized personnel to study the rectification plan and discuss the budget. We will gradually start next year. However, the ministry's budget only accounts for 5/1000 of the national budget. We will do our best to use our limited financial resources to accomplish something.</p>

<h3>Severe Rice Riots in Chengdu, City Government Exerting Utmost Effort to Mediate</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch of the 1st] The rice riots in Chengdu worsened on the 30th and 1st, seemingly becoming a well-organized political conspiracy.

<h3>Recent Situation in Japan: Food Most Urgent, Empress Raises Silkworms and Chickens, Startling Crime Rate Among Officials</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 2nd] Wu Xueyi, our senior advisor to the Far East International Military Tribunal, who recently returned from Tokyo, spoke to reporters about the recent situation in Japan. He said that the most urgent issue facing Japan is the food problem. In early June, specialized schools above the junior college level in Kyoto, Nara, and other places had to take early holidays due to a lack of rice rations. The rationed food only covers two-thirds of the consumption amount, and the remaining one-third must be obtained from the black market or through self-cultivation for supplementation. Therefore, from the prime minister and ministers down to the common people, every household plants food crops and vegetables. The sides of roads and gaps between trees are also utilized. Even the Empress raises silkworms and chickens. Due to insufficient salaries to maintain integrity, the crime rate among officials is increasing daily. From September of the year before last to the end of last year, there were a total of 11,000 officials nationwide. The Japanese are extremely obedient and meticulous in their service to the American military. In the past six months, there has not been a single incident involving the Japanese against the Allied forces. Their goal in "enduring the unendurable" (words from the Japanese Emperor's surrender edict) is solely to hope to restore foreign trade and conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, so that they can return to normal as soon as possible. When asked about the difficulties for Chinese people who want to go to Japan, Wu said: Under military control in Japan, exit and entry both require special permission from MacArthur's headquarters, and food and accommodation are very difficult. Before the peace treaty is concluded, studying abroad is completely out of the question. Letters should also be sent to the Representative Office of the Mission to Japan at 88 Gaoyou Road, Shanghai, and entrusted to American military planes or commercial planes to fly to Japan, which takes about ten days.</p>

<h3>National Highway Network Plan: Divided into Baseline, Meridian, and Latitude Lines, Totaling More Than 57,000 Kilometers</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Nanjing, 2nd] The National Highway Network Plan, which was passed at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 1st, was originally drafted by the Ministry of Communications with the ultimate goal of consolidating national defense. After review by the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and National Defense, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The plan stipulates that all national highways are divided into three types: baseline, meridian, and latitude lines. The baseline consists of four lines from Shanghai to Lhasa, the meridian consists of five lines from Shanhaiguan to Hai'an, and the latitude consists of six lines from Zhennanguan to Xiamen, as well as 23 connecting lines from Wuhu to Shexian, for a total of 38 lines. The total length is 57,252 kilometers. Routes with transportation value, such as the capital, important ports, and international passages, are all included. Some of these were originally provincial highways and will be taken over by the central government. Highways connecting provincial capitals and county seats will be designated as provincial highways. The initial national highway lines to be taken over by the central government are tentatively set at 38,573 kilometers to avoid difficulties for the provinces and prevent a sudden increase in the burden on the national treasury. Of these, more than 27,000 kilometers are already managed by the Ministry of Communications, so only about 10,000 kilometers will actually be taken over. After the takeover, the various district highway engineering management bureaus under the Highway Administration will handle the construction, maintenance, protection, improvement, supervision, transportation, and administrative tasks. The rest will remain under provincial management for the time being. For the routes taken over, the Ministry of Communications will negotiate with the provincial governments to formulate measures for gradual takeover, except for those already managed by central government bureaus. The unified management regulations for national highway transportation will be drafted by the Ministry of Communications and implemented after approval.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the National Federation of Shipping Associations</h3>
<p>During the eight years of the war of resistance, the complete occupation of coastal ports led to significant losses in various industries, with the shipping industry being the most prominent. It is estimated that the total losses amounted to 300,000 tons, with private companies accounting for 90 percent of that.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, the remaining vessels totaled only 100,000 tons. In less than two years, this has increased to 800,000 tons. Some were newly purchased by various companies, some were donated by the Allied forces, some were purchased from foreign countries, and some were purchased from foreign merchants in China. However, most of them were taken over from the enemy and puppet regimes. Regardless of their origin, the rapid organization, expansion, and catch-up within a short period, not only restoring the old appearance but also exceeding the original pre-war tonnage, is nothing short of a miracle. It is likely that similar recovery efforts in post-war economic reconstruction are rare.</p>
<p>That being said, the total tonnage of merchant ships in Japan is said to be 1.5 million tons, and the UK is actively building ships, with a total tonnage of nearly 20 million tons, while the US has expanded to over 60 million tons. Compared to our current total tonnage of ships, it is truly insignificant. Moreover, more than half of the ships are only 20 to 200 tons or more, only suitable for inland river routes and for lighterage near the docks. Only a few are 3,000 to 5,000 tons or more. Therefore, although there are currently four routes originating from Shanghai: (1) Southeast Asia route, (2) Northern Seas route, (3) Yangtze River route, (4) Ocean route, the actual routes are limited to the first three. The fourth route, including Shanghai to Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas, still needs to be prepared and planned. The possibility is very small until the US surplus ships, such as the Liberty and Victory classes, are transferred. Moreover, last September, the Ministry of Communications promulgated measures to allow the shipping industry to employ foreigners, stipulating the proportion of Chinese and foreign staff. Along the coast and in near seas, it cannot exceed one-third, and in the ocean, it cannot exceed one-half, which shows the current lack of talent. Furthermore, in October of last year, the Ministry of Communications issued minimum standards for shipping companies to purchase old ships, stipulating that passenger ships must not be more than 25 years old, cargo ships must not be more than 28 years old, the draft must be within 18 feet, the speed must be above 10 knots, and fuel must be coal-based. This shows that the Ministry of Communications is not completely satisfied with the existing ships.</p>
<p>Originally, after the victory, due to the urgent need for shipping, the profits of the shipping industry were considerable. Even under the burden of military and government transportation, the cost of purchased ships could be fully earned back after several months of operation. The relief materials undertaken by the jointly organized Ji Yun Group, although the freight must also be discounted, can still barely maintain the cost. The reason for the rapid recovery may be here, and the equipment still needs to be perfected, the management still needs to be refreshed, and the training of employees, the improvement of insurance and rescue, etc., still require the joint efforts of the shipping industry.</p>
<p>For all of the above reasons, a few months ago, the Shanghai Shipping Association sent a letter to colleagues in various places, initiating the organization of the National Federation of Shipping Associations, in order to pool strength and seek improvement together. This proposal has been widely supported in various places and will be officially established at a general meeting in Shanghai today. The significance of this move is extremely important. The two major arteries of transportation are railways and ships. At a time when internal strife has not subsided and land transportation is often obstructed, the shipping industry is relied upon to connect the north and south, maintain passenger transport, freight transport, and military transport. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of the shipping industry should not be viewed solely as a matter of interest to the industry, but as a matter of concern to the entire national economic lifeline.</p>
<p>Now, the issue of ship reparations from Japan is becoming increasingly urgent, and the transfer of surplus US ships is also about to mature. These tasks are extremely important and cannot be accomplished by one person or one organization alone. According to Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Shipping Association: China's shipping industry can reach 1.5 million tons next year and 3 million tons the year after. This heavy burden clearly needs to be shouldered jointly by relevant people across the country. Therefore, the establishment of the National Federation of Shipping Associations has special significance at present. Since the surrender of Japan and the abolition of unequal treaties, the scope of activities of China's shipping industry has expanded, but the responsibilities they bear have also increased. How to expand the scope, promote business, to meet the actual needs in the future, and how to consolidate shipping rights, and use foreign ships to enrich domestic and foreign routes, is the biggest issue facing the Federation.</p>

<h3>Consultations on Compromise Plan Fail: The Three Foreign Ministers' Conference Ends in Failure; Molotov Returns to Moscow Today; Bidault May Fly to England to Discuss Western European Reconstruction Plan</h3>
<p>[News Dispatch] Paris, 2nd Broadcast: The Three Foreign Ministers' Conference declared its conclusion at 5:50 PM today. The compromise plan proposed by France was not accepted by the Soviet Union, leading to a deadlock in the conference and ending without result.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Britain and France openly broke with the Soviet Union today over the Marshall Plan for European reconstruction. Before the break, Molotov delivered a lengthy speech denouncing the proposals of Britain and France, saying that they would divide Europe into two blocs, creating new difficulties. Molotov also warned Britain and France: "The Soviet government believes that Britain and France should be responsible for all the consequences. These consequences run counter to the path of European reconstruction." Molotov is scheduled to return to the Soviet Union tomorrow.</p>
<p>[News Dispatch] London, 2nd Broadcast: According to sources in Britain and France, Bevin and Bidault expected that Molotov would reject the compromise plan proposed by France and intend to jointly appeal to various countries to participate in the Western European reconstruction plan. It is said that Bidault may go to London on Friday to discuss the US aid plan for Western European reconstruction with Bevin in detail.</p>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Paris, 1st] The plan proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault to the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference today is as follows: The Three Foreign Ministers' Conference of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, attaches importance to the need to accelerate the economic reconstruction and development of European countries affected by the war. This Conference believes that this task will be facilitated by the economic aid provided by the United States, as suggested by Secretary of State Marshall on June 5th. This Conference feels that Europe should first develop its economic production to help itself. The aid from the United States will enable Europe to carry out this task and, before Europe can obtain the necessary resources on its own, the United States will provide these resources, which is of decisive significance for Europe. Therefore, the aid from the United States will be the most reliable guarantee for European countries to restore their economies and maintain their independence. A special agency will be established to collect and prepare all the information needed to report on European resources and needs as soon as possible. This agency will be organized by European countries willing to participate. This agency will not interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, nor will it take any actions that could be regarded as infringing on the sovereignty of these countries, or that could hinder the development of trade between European countries.</p>
<h3>Marshall Delivers Speech: Says US Has No Imperialist Ambitions; Aid to Europe Aims to Help Self and Help Others</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech to the National Women's Press Club today, refuting the notion that the United States has imperialist goals and attempts to use its aid plan for Europe to achieve its ambitions of political and economic domination, dismissing it as a fantasy distortion and malicious slander, and saying that those responsible for such malicious propaganda are harmful to distressed nations. The future of these nations depends on international economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Although Marshall did not directly mention the Soviet Union or the Paris Conference or his aid plan for Europe, when he spoke of the outside world criticizing rather than praising the aid provided by the United States, his goal was obvious. Although Marshall refuted the notion that the United States has imperialist goals, he also declared that the American people are not making contributions to help the world recover without any demands. The American people solemnly demand that whatever contributions they make must be used effectively to achieve the expected goals. The contributions of the American people must not be used for selfish political and economic goals, but only to help economic recovery. Finally, the aid of the American people has a great goal to restore the hope and trust of the American people, so that they know that the world will one day be peaceful and safe. Marshall also solemnly pointed out that US troops have withdrawn from Europe, and declared that there are no parties in European countries that are willing to be driven by US interests and attempt to conquer governments from within. The United States also has no spies attempting to control the police equipment of European countries. In addition, there are no companies jointly formed by the United States and Europe forcing European governments to recognize them. Furthermore, in terms of the figures of US aid to Europe since the end of the war, a total of 82 million tons of goods have been aided to Europe after the war, with a value of over 9 billion dollars. Marshall also declared that his enumeration of these facts is not to boast, but in view of the accusations of others against the United States, it is really necessary to make people not forget these facts. Judging from the historical record, no one has been more generous and selfless than the American people who have aided distressed people. Although there have been many examples of aiding others in history, their goals have all been to seek their own satisfaction. Now, the US government's assistance in restoring the world economy is not entirely based on a position of compassion. The American people believe that the stability and prosperity of the world is also an important factor in the happiness of the American people. The American people recognize the significant sacrifices made by other people and countries during the war, and this is not without a contribution. When Marshall began his speech, he also said that others have criticized the US's foreign policy for being erratic, but in fact, although the US is in a changing situation, it still maintains its consistent policy. The United States gave the greatest assistance to the establishment of the United Nations. Now the principles of this international organization are encountering obstacles everywhere, which cannot but make people feel greatly disappointed and uneasy. The American people know that the post-war world situation is not as good as expected, and the tasks ahead are even more arduous than anticipated three years ago. However, the American people's determination to build a world that allows the principles of the United Nations to be used and developed has not changed in the slightest. US policy is based on these determinations. Marshall also emphasized the importance of newspapers and radio stations in promoting public understanding of foreign affairs, because in countries with freedom of the press, even distorted propaganda can be corrected within a reasonable time.</p>
<h3>French New Proposals Leave Molotov Stymied</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 2nd] Regarding the new proposals made by French Foreign Minister Bidault in an effort to bring the Paris Conference to a successful conclusion, the "Daily Mail" recently commented: Britain and France "stymied" Molotov today, at least making him feel at a loss for a day, because Molotov is facing the fact that all Soviet satellite states are eager to accept US aid. This is probably the reason why Molotov is now asking for time to consider. The "Times" commented: Molotov also does not agree with the French proposal, and he has always been unwilling to completely reject any proposal at previous conference sessions, so it is expected that he will put forward a counter-proposal tomorrow for the other party to consider or reject. The "Daily Telegraph" also said: Molotov is now considering this suggestion worth considering, and he may ask Moscow for instructions again.</p>
<h3>TASS Announces Soviet Foreign Minister's Suggestions</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Enskoe, 2nd] TASS announced today the content of the suggestion made by Foreign Minister Molotov to the Paris Conference last night. The full text is as follows: The Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union recognize the importance of accelerating the reconstruction and continued development of the economies of European countries affected by the war and believe that the implementation of this plan will be facilitated by the economic assistance provided by the United States. Secretary of State Marshall has already issued a statement on this assistance on June 5th. The Three Foreign Ministers' Conference believes that it is not the task of this Conference to draft a general economic plan for European countries, because the drafting of this economic plan, and the participation of other countries, will inevitably force other countries to accept the intentions of strong countries, constituting interference in the internal affairs of other countries and infringing on the sovereignty of other countries.</p>
<p>Moreover, drafting a general economic plan for European countries is sufficient to disrupt the existing economic relations between European countries, causing friction between these countries, making it more difficult to develop the extremely necessary economic relations between European countries. Therefore, the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference believes that the following steps should be taken: An Aid Committee should be established, composed of representatives of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and representatives of other European countries, to investigate the needs of European countries for economic assistance, the possibility of the United States providing such assistance, and to assist European countries in obtaining such assistance. Under the Aid Committee, there will be subcommittees on food, fuel, equipment, etc. Each subcommittee will be composed of representatives of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, together with two representatives selected from European countries that were occupied by Germany and contributed to the defeat of the enemy, based on their special interests in the work of the subcommittee. Former enemy countries may also be invited by the subcommittee to submit their opinions. The problem of Germany will be examined by the four major powers of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. The tasks of the Aid Committee are: (1) to accept the estimates of European countries regarding US assistance; (2) to draft a free plan based on these estimates, in which priority should be given to countries that were invaded by Germany and contributed to the victory of the Allied forces; (3) to investigate the possibility of the United States providing appropriate economic assistance; (4) to establish relations with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.</p>
<h3>Former US Assistant Secretary of State: Denounces Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] Bill, a leader of New York liberals who formerly served as Assistant Secretary of State, said in a speech at a dinner to welcome Italian Socialist leaders Lagaz and Tieciong: Peace treaties are diplomatic strategies used to establish peace in Europe, but peace has not yet arrived, so the United States still assumes the obligation to provide assistance in maintaining and rebuilding Italy as an independent nation. The American people believe that Italy's social system is a matter for the Italian people to decide for themselves. What the United States wants is a free and independent Italy, free from the control of any foreign country. The American people are supporting the Marshall Plan to liberate Europe from hunger, poverty, and turmoil. Italy is an important factor in the Marshall Plan. Bill is confident that the American people and Congress will approve the supply of money and materials under the Marshall Plan, and said: "The claim spread by Moscow that the United States is about to collapse economically is obviously absurd. The American people are deeply bewildered and puzzled by the fact that some countries are suppressing the freedom of the people, bullying neighboring countries, and carrying out military expansion on the one hand, and telling the United States about poverty on the other hand. The American people are willing to spend millions of dollars to relieve poverty, but are unwilling to give a single cent to aggressor nations."</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Measures Towards Japan Increase Allied Dissatisfaction; Australia Expected to Express Strong Position at Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd] The British Foreign Office spokesman's explicit expression of dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the American policy towards Japan has been well received by representatives of various Allied nations here. Officials at MacArthur's headquarters have stated that Australia's attitude is expected to be the most difficult to deal with at the peace conference. Following Britain's formal protest regarding the permission given to Japan for whaling and the mining of phosphate on Angaur Island, the British Foreign Office spokesman's clear statement further confirms that Britain and Australia hold the same position. Britain and Australia particularly express skepticism towards MacArthur's "spiritual revolution," believing it premature to claim that Japan has already abandoned militarism, and they do not feel optimistic about the future of Japan as envisioned by MacArthur. They also express dissatisfaction with the propaganda from MacArthur's headquarters that the United States is granting benefits to Japan while other Allied nations are waiting for an opportunity to oppress Japan. China's criticism of the occupation policy is even more profound and meticulous than Britain's. For example, China has expressed opposition to MacArthur's directive allowing Japanese police to carry rifles and pistols, and Chinese representatives are particularly indignant about the treatment of Chinese and Korean people in Japan. As for the Soviet Union, it has consistently not recognized any merit in the occupation policy. From the beginning, the Soviet Union has opposed MacArthur's headquarters' policies on wages, price controls, fishing rights, and land reform, among others.</p>
<h3>British Refutation: MacArthur's Headquarters Statement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd] Officials of the British Commonwealth are deeply shocked by the statement made last night by a spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters regarding the permission granted to Japan for whaling and the mining of phosphate on Angaur Island. They believe that these two matters should have been discussed with the countries concerned before being approved by MacArthur's headquarters. As for the discussion on whaling, it is far from completion; as for the mining of phosphate, the opinions of other Allied nations were not sought at all. Whaling involves the economic and military issues of Australia and New Zealand, and there is a suspicion of events that should be handled under the preliminary peace treaty, providing grounds for a strong protest.</p>
<h3>South's Representative to the Security Council Firmly Denies; South's Assistance to Greek Guerrillas; Accuses US of Deliberately Protecting Greece</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 1st] The report submitted by the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee has recently been discussed by the United Nations Security Council. During the session, the Yugoslav representative firmly denied that Yugoslavia assisted Greek guerrillas in resisting the Greek government. It is claimed that Greece had submitted fifty-seven incidents of border conflicts to the investigation committee, accusing Yugoslavia of assisting Greek guerrillas. The investigation committee only reviewed four of these incidents, and then immediately determined that Yugoslavia should be responsible for these border incidents. On the other hand, the Yugoslav government had also submitted seventy-nine incidents of Greek violations of the Yugoslav border to the investigation committee, but none of them were considered by the investigation committee. The United States' representative to the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee, Mr. Etheridge, acted hastily in assigning responsibility to northern Greece, with the aim of concealing the fact that there was insufficient evidence. In short, Yugoslavia hopes that the Security Council will carefully study the report of the investigation committee to accurately understand the truth of the situation in northern Greece.</p>
<h3>Over 3,000 Restaurants Operated by Overseas Chinese in Japan Cease Operations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd Dispatch] The Japanese government has ordered all restaurants, cafes, bars, and other various drinking establishments in Japan to cease operations from July 5th to the end of this year. This Japanese government ordinance is equally effective for hotels owned or operated by our overseas Chinese compatriots and Korean people. Anyone who violates this emergency measures law will be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of 50,000 yen. Japanese newspapers believe that this ordinance will affect 200,000 restaurants and hotels, and it is estimated that it will lead to the unemployment of 4 million people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] In order to conserve food, the Japanese government has prohibited the opening of food shops nationwide. As a result, among the more than 3,000 food shops opened by overseas Chinese in Japan, two-thirds of the workers are affected. The head of our delegation in Japan, Mr. Shang, is very concerned about this.</p>
<h3>President Truman Signs Bill to Join Refugee Organization</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] President Truman has recently signed the bill for the United States to join the International Refugee Organization. The bill authorizes the government to allocate $73.5 million as the U.S. contribution to the organization's expenses for the next twelve months.</p>
<h3>Japanese Diet Begins Questioning: Katayama Emphasizes Rejection of Class Struggle; Minister of Agriculture States This Year's Food Shortage is Two Million Koku</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The proceedings of today's Diet session are as follows: In the House of Councillors, representatives from the Liberal Party (Itagaki), Ryokufūkai (Sato), and Socialist Party (Yoshikawa) sequentially questioned Prime Minister Katayama's policy speech from yesterday, and Prime Minister Katayama and various ministers successively responded. The session adjourned at 12:20 PM. In the House of Representatives, the session began at 1:50 PM. First, Kato Kanju questioned, and Katayama, Ashida, Hirano, and Awazu sequentially responded. The session recessed at 3:45 PM and reconvened at 4:06 PM. Kitamura Tokutaro raised questions, and Katayama and Morito responded. Both Kato's and Kitamura's questions remained within the positions of their parties, so the Diet session today can be considered to have proceeded smoothly. The session adjourned at 4:54 PM.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The Japanese Diet continued its session today, and the questioning battle of various parties has already begun. Prime Minister Katayama and various ministers responded to the questions of each party one by one. The following is a summary: (1) Prime Minister Katayama's response to "General Policy" stated: In political actions, we will eliminate all secretism and not allow extreme thoughts and actions. While acknowledging the existence of classes, we reject class struggle. As for strikes, they are the legitimate rights of workers, so we recognize them. All politics will be conducted through the parliamentary system, and we absolutely reject the bureaucratic self-righteousness. (2) Minister of Agriculture Hirano's response to the "Food Problem" stated: Until the new grains are on the market this autumn, the quantity of main food needed by Japan is 16.52 million koku, while the total amount of requisitioning and the projected amount of imported food to be released this year is only 14.18 million koku, leaving a shortage of 1.34 million koku, which means that each person is short of 16 days of food. Adding the 12 days of food that has been delayed in distribution so far, there is a shortage of about one month of food in total. Therefore, if we maintain the current rationing level, we must fundamentally change the amount of rice to be requisitioned for the next year, so we have submitted a bill related to this problem in this Diet session. (3) Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani's response to "National Management" stated: Coal national management will not implement bureaucratic control, but will fully pay attention to its democratization, and intends to ensure the planned production of 30 million tons. (4) Minister of Education Morito's response to "School Education" stated: Regardless of whether the population has increased or not, schools were not added during the war, but rather decreased by more than 80,000 due to war damage, of which 30% have no school buildings. The current policy is to restore normalcy as much as possible.</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Discuss Former Japanese Mandated Islands Trusteeship; US Prepares to Participate in South Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee will discuss on the 7th the agreement between the United States and the United Nations regarding the control of the former Japanese mandated territories, namely the Mariana, Marshall, and Caroline Islands. According to the agreement passed by the United Nations Security Council, these three territories are all placed under the control of a "strategic area," and the United States may, if necessary, establish defense facilities on these islands and may prohibit foreigners from traveling to these islands.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg recently told the press that the committee has approved the United States' participation in the Caribbean Sea Commission (which is organized by representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands) and the South Pacific Commission (which is organized by representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Australia). The purpose of this meeting is to promote international cooperation to promote the culture of non-self-governing regions in these two regions.</p>
<h3>Ashida Hitoshi Attempts to Conceal His Ambitions; Still Intends to Covet Islands Near the Mainland</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida solemnly declared on the 2nd that Japan has no territorial ambitions and firmly insisted that Japan faithfully abides by the Potsdam Declaration, abandons armed forces, and has done its best so far to promote the democratization of Japan. Ashida made this statement in response to a question from Social Democratic Party member Kato at a plenary session of the House of Representatives. Kato stated: According to news reports, Ashida had expressed that Japan demands the return of Okinawa Island and the Kuril Islands, which gives the impression that Japan has territorial ambitions. According to Ashida's address to the Diet members, his remarks were made when meeting with foreign reporters on June 5th, and unfortunately the news was misrepresented. The territory of Japan will be finally determined by the future peace conference, "but there are some islands near Hokkaido and Kyushu that have always been part of the Japanese mainland both ethnically and historically. We have never intended to acquire territory by force; this is what I wanted to tell the foreign reporters."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Prime Minister Katayama stated today in response to a question from Sato Naotake (Ryokufūkai) in the House of Councillors that Foreign Minister Ashida actually holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister in this cabinet. This is enough to show that the current cabinet does not disregard diplomatic issues.</p>
<h3>Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia Plan to Form Southeast Asian League</h3>
<p>And Intend to Invite India and Indonesia to Participate</p>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 1st] Thai Prime Minister Nuai Suwan declared today that Thailand and France will initiate the organization of a Southeast Asian alliance by Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam; India, Indonesia, and Borneo should also be invited to participate in the future. The alliance will discuss matters related to irrigation, fisheries, and transportation in the Southeast Asian region.</p>
<h3>Chilean Supreme Court Announces: State of War with Japan Ends</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Santiago, 2nd] The Chilean Supreme Court announced on the afternoon of the 1st that the state of war between Chile and Japan has ended. It is claimed that although Chile has not actually signed a peace treaty with Japan, it is not necessary to conclude a treaty to end the state of war. After the end of the war, the state of war also ends. There are many precedents for this, such as the Chilean-Spanish War in 1865 and the French-Spanish War in 1720. The important significance of this move lies in using the existence or absence of a state of war with Japan as a legal procedure for political competition. For example, the law stipulates that members of the Chilean Senate and House of Representatives can only hold government positions during wartime. Therefore, Senator Duhart was able to serve as Vice President, Joryde was able to serve as Foreign Minister, Baussay was able to serve as Minister of Economy, and Rios was able to serve as Minister of Education.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Cabinet Still Not Formed, Naval Battle Erupts Again off Java Coast; Overseas Chinese Demand Our Country Recognize Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 2nd] The Indonesian Republic's reply to the United States' note on mediating the Indonesian-Dutch crisis is expected to be released soon. According to Dutch sources here, the differences in political views among the four major parties in Indonesia may prevent them from reaching an agreement. According to Indonesian sources, former Prime Minister Sjahrir, who resigned last week, will return to Yogyakarta within a day or two to assume an important position. The Republic's communication agency reports that President Sukarno has consulted with Socialist leader Sjahrir, Nationalist Party's Gani, and labor leader Setiadjit on the formation of a cabinet, and it is likely that a left-wing Nationalist Party cabinet will be formed. Although the largest party (Muslim Party) will not participate, this will also be a strong cabinet. The Nationalist Party is the second largest party, occupying 47 seats in Congress. At the same time, it is learned that the Nationalist Party has no objection to Sjahrir serving as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Also according to Yogyakarta sources, the position of Prime Minister may be entrusted to Rom, the former Minister of Interior of the Muslim Party, but according to Muslim leader Sudarman, he has not received this request.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 2nd] An Indonesian military spokesman reported today that two Dutch warships opened fire on an Indonesian battery on the east coast of Java, destroying three observation posts and a telegraph line. A Dutch light cruiser also passed by the battery during the engagement but did not cause any trouble. However, this information has not been confirmed by the Dutch side.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 2nd] According to Anita News Agency, the largest overseas Chinese organization in the Dutch East Indies, the Chung Hwa Society, held a meeting and decided to request the Chinese government to formally recognize the Indonesian Republic.</p>
<h3>Japan's Huge Gold Reserves: Allied Headquarters Requests Unfreezing</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] According to information obtained by the Associated Press, the Allied Headquarters has submitted a request to the Far Eastern Commission to use Japan's frozen gold and other precious metals, worth approximately $200 million, for the Allied Headquarters' use as collateral for purchasing raw materials. These metals are currently sealed in the Bank of Japan. It is believed here that this matter is another attempt by the Allied Headquarters' Economic and Scientific Section to obtain revolving funds for Japan to purchase its own repayable bulk raw materials. It is pointed out that a collateral of 200 million in gold can obtain loans several times greater than this. Therefore, it is believed here that American or other foreign merchants who are willing to ship raw materials to Japan would be very satisfied if they could obtain a 20% gold guarantee. It is expected that some members of the Far Eastern Commission will express opposition, as they have always viewed the gold sealed in the Bank of Japan as only for reparations.</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Returns to Violation; Meets with Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rhee Returns to Washington for Instructions</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 2nd] Dr. Syngman Rhee, who left Korea 49 years ago, returned to Seoul yesterday. At 10:00 AM today, he visited Syngman Rhee and Kim Gu. He will meet with newspaper reporters and make a statement tomorrow.</p>

The US State Department announced today that the military government affairs of South Korea will be transferred from the Department of the Army to the Department of State. Lerch's return to the United States this time is to consult with the Department of State on the transfer matters.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Government Asks Parliament for Vote of Confidence</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] The French government's motion of confidence will be voted on by the National Assembly on the 4th of this month, and it is expected that the government will obtain a majority of votes. At the same time, rumors are spreading that Prime Minister Ramadier will mention the possibility of internal cabinet reorganization during his speech in parliament and announce three or four new cabinet members, with Minister of State Gouin entering the cabinet. It is heard that those joining the cabinet will be Socialist leader Blum, Radical Party leader Herriot, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor Chatel, and former Prime Minister Reynaud.</p>
<h3>Philippine Prisoners Break Out of Jail; Rob Mayor and Occupy Airport</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 2nd] According to a report from an official of the Aviation Bureau, prisoners in Mindoro Province broke out of jail today and attempted to seize the Calapan Airport and a Philippine Airlines plane. The military police are currently engaging them in combat.</p>
<p>According to Philippine Airlines, they have not received any radio communication from Calapan since this morning. The Ministry of the Interior stated that the prisoners robbed Mindoro Governor Molent, and two C47 aircraft full of soldiers have flown from Manila to Calapan to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the "Champagne" ship docked in Calapan, a group of armed men disarmed the police in the city and surrounded and guarded all military police. Military police from Hatton Gas have rushed to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Italian Transport Ship Explodes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 1st] The transport ship "Bani Gagari" exploded suddenly today while unloading ammunition in the port of Santo Stefano, killing 68 people. Several others are trapped in the cabin and unable to escape.</p>
<h3>Indian Army to be Divided; Will be Reorganized with Assistance from British Officers</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] The India Office announced today that Indian Governor-General Mountbatten has ordered the existing land, sea, and air forces of India to be divided between the Indian State and the Islamic State. Units with a majority of Islamic officers and soldiers will be transferred to the Islamic State, and those with a minority will be transferred to the Indian State. After August 15th, all troops should be reorganized as soon as possible based on volunteerism and territorial basis. Muslims in units serving within the Indian State may join the Islamic State army, and non-Muslims in units within the Islamic State may join the Indian State army. However, before the governments of each country can provide for them, they will still be under the unified command of Marshal Auchinleck.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 2nd] The Indian army will also be divided into two within nine months, belonging to "Hindustan" and "Pakistan" respectively. This move will likely make both unable to abandon British assistance, and will cause the British army to postpone its withdrawal. Although both India and Pakistan will establish their own general staff departments, they will still need the assistance of experienced British officers to reorganize them. Regarding the Joint Defense Council opposed by the Congress Party, although it will be abolished after the completion of the division, it is expected that Britain will exert pressure at that time to allow it to continue to exist, so that it can plan India's defense issues within the British liaison organization.</p>
<h3>Clayton Arrives in Geneva; Says US Concerned about Europe's Reaction to Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 2nd] US Under Secretary of State Clayton arrived here today after discussing the Marshall Plan for European Recovery with British officials in London. At a press conference, he declared that if the Paris Three Foreign Ministers Conference adjourns without results regarding the Marshall Plan, "as far as I know," the United States will not take any action. The US government is currently waiting for Europe to express its attitude towards the Marshall Plan.</p>

<h3>Economic Supervision Work; Takes Active Action; Spot Checks Yarn and Cloth Shops; Removes Intercom Telephones; Acting Director Yu Expresses "Tiger Hunting" Determination</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Economic Council held its first meeting the day before yesterday, it was decided that economic supervision work will be uniformly implemented by the Police Bureau in the future. The Economic Section of the bureau officially started action yesterday, first targeting several illegal yarn and cloth merchants who monopolize, raise prices, and hoard for speculation. It is reported that yesterday, Dafeng, Shengji, Changcheng, Deji, Yutai, and five other companies were investigated. In addition to continuing spot checks today, they will also thoroughly remove unauthorized intercom telephones in major building securities firms in conjunction with the Public Utilities Bureau, so as to eliminate off-site transactions and the black market for gold and banknotes. At the same time, the business of all banks in the city will be inspected one by one in conjunction with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai-based personnel. Acting Director Yu said to reporters during a meeting yesterday that this work can be completed within this week. Yu also said that Mayor Wu has a great determination for economic supervision work. In addition, cases that violate the economic emergency measures laws will be handled by the courts if the circumstances are relatively minor, while more serious cases will be submitted to the central government for approval. In addition, the Telegraph Bureau has been requested to refuse to receive or send reports on port exchange rates and various black market quotes, and newspapers are strictly prohibited from publishing them. In order to achieve contact in the execution of work, Yu intends to propose to the mayor that the gold banknote, yarn and cloth, food, cooking oil, and fuel groups under the Economic Council jointly establish an office to have the opportunity to review the regular work. Finally, Yu revealed that the Economic Council will be permanent, so the bureau's economic police will be increased to 100.</p>
<h3>No Reaction from All Parties After Last Month's Index Release</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian said yesterday that after the release of the June cost of living index, there has been no reaction from labor and management. Currently, there is only the aftermath of the management's request to calculate salaries according to last month's cost of living index. However, the labor-management evaluation meeting only limited that those who have cost estimates or orders may calculate according to last month's index.</p>
<h3>Restriction of Warehouse Receipt Transactions Under Study by Various Agencies</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It was proposed to restrict warehouse receipt transactions at the first Economic Conference. Regarding this issue, Mr. Gu Yuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday: Regulations for various warehouse receipt transactions in Shanghai include the provision that Taicang public warehouse receipts for guns must be directly delivered within ten days; otherwise, the rights are cancelled. In the case of cooking oil, the Social Affairs Bureau discovered illegal buying and selling of locally produced goods, so last week, it ordered that the warehouse receipts be cleared within ten days. For cotton cloth, Mayor Wu and the Economic Supervision Group agreed to limit the time for picking up goods to one week to half a month; otherwise, it would be considered hoarding. Coal has always been delivered directly by the Coal Industry Association, so there are no warehouse receipt transactions. The same is true for rice. The Economic Conference decided to impose restrictions on the storage period after goods are traded, and various materials agencies are carefully studying this matter.</p>
<h3>Rice for Poor Households Can Now Be Distributed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the distribution of rice to the poor in the city, the Civil Food Adjustment Committee stated yesterday that the Pingtiao stations in the Yimiao and Ti Lan Qiao districts will soon be established. Other districts are waiting for the district offices to complete the setup of the Pingtiao stations, after which the rice can be distributed. The Adjustment Committee has sent ten staff members to assist the district offices in expediting the process. One million rice ration cards for the poor and six hundred thousand rice ration cards for workers are currently being printed and will be issued as soon as they are ready. If the quantity allocated by the Adjustment Committee is insufficient for distribution in each district, the distribution to ordinary poor households may be temporarily delayed, and priority will be given to the moderately poor and destitute. As of now, more than 40,000 dan of rice have been approved for distribution to factories and schools for June. Applications for another 16,000 dan or so have been submitted and are expected to be approved soon.</p>
<h3>Dispute at Guang Sheng Hang Resolved, Knitting Operations in the Second District to Resume</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Xiechang Tobacco Company on Daxilu Road suspended operations in April, with the factory paying workers half a month's salary.

(2) Starting with the June wages, wages will be handled in accordance with the labor-management contract, i.e., the previous month's index will be used, and wages will be calculated at 85% of that. (3) The Social Affairs Bureau will investigate and handle the arrested workers. (4) Workers should be ordered to fully resume work by July 4. (5) There should be no further excessive actions.

<h3>Yarn Industry Colludes with Customs Brokers to Exploit the Opportunity for Large-Scale Fraud - Large Batch of Export Customs Declarations Approved After Verification</h3>
<p>According to information from the Economic Section of the Garrison Command: In order to balance the supply of cotton yarn and cloth and stabilize prices, the Executive Yuan issued an order on April 22 stating that "Cotton yarn and cloth declared for transit or transfer by rail must be released only after the Textile Industry Management Committee has issued a permit." The Ministries of Finance, Economics, and Communications were instructed to comply, and the Shanghai Municipal Government was instructed to follow suit. However, the Jianghai Customs Office did not formally announce this order until 11 a.m. on the 25th. Upon receiving intelligence, relevant personnel immediately took advantage of the opportunity to quickly collude with familiar customs brokers and commit fraud within a few hours that morning. They rapidly approved a large number of inflated export customs declarations for yarn and cloth. Investigators were dispatched to verify the addresses and confirmed that the information was accurate. The entire case file and evidence have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for investigation.</p>

<h3>New Utility Prices Proposed - Director Zhao to Go to Nanjing to Negotiate, Lowest Increase of One Time, Highest Increase of Three Times</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The new prices for utility services in the city have been calculated by the Public Utilities Bureau. It was originally planned that Director Zhao Zengjue would take them to Nanjing for implementation after they were approved by the National Price Conference yesterday. However, due to the temporary postponement of the Price Conference, the price increase will have to wait for some time. However, the utility service agencies are suffering huge losses due to the old prices, and there is no fixed date for the National Price Conference to be convened, so Director Zhao is quite anxious. He spoke to Nanjing on the phone yesterday, saying that if the National Price Conference is not planned to be convened for a while, he will go to the capital first to personally consult with Executive Yuan President Zhang. According to what Director Zhao told reporters yesterday: The basic method for adjusting utility prices has been drafted, using fuel, foreign exchange, and the cost of living index as the basis. He hopes to obtain a thorough solution on this trip to the capital so that the city's utility services can automatically adjust prices based on a set method in the future, without having to wait for the decision of the National Price Conference each time.</p>
<p>Although the new prices after the utility service adjustment have been decided, Director Zhao is unwilling to disclose them before they are approved by the central government. However, according to his statement: Because the cost increases for each company are different, the adjustment of prices also varies, with the lowest increase being one time and the highest not exceeding three times.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Wireless Telephone Temporarily Suspends Acceptance of Registration - Very Low Fees, Supply Falls Short of Demand</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Sino-American wireless telephone officially opened the day before yesterday, and many citizens went to register. However, due to solar flares, only four hours of telephone service are available each day, from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. the next morning, and changes in weather can also temporarily affect the transmission of radio waves, so at most only a dozen calls can be made each day. The Telecommunications Bureau has scheduled those who have already registered and has temporarily suspended registration since yesterday. It is estimated that those who have already registered will be able to complete their calls by this Friday. According to the person in charge of international wireless telephones at the Telecommunications Bureau: The close relations between China and the United States and the demand for communications were expected, so the crowding of wireless telephone registrations was inevitable. Also, because the fees are too low, they will increase the use by general non-essential and curious individuals. The expedited telephone fee between Shanghai and Chongqing is 163,000 yuan per call, while a Sino-American call only costs 144,000 yuan, which is not very reasonable. However, due to the Sino-American agreement, the telephone fee will not increase unless the foreign exchange rate changes.</p>

Chen initially refused, but Zhang threatened to evict them, and on June 4, they eventually engaged in physical relations. After hearing about this, Han moved to a shed in Qinghefang, Zhonghua Road, but Zhang continued to pester them from time to time. Chen also reproached him repeatedly, which was also discovered by Han. It was then decided to send Chen back to the countryside on the 25th of last month. Upon hearing this news, Zhang went to Han's residence on the evening of the 25th and openly demanded another tryst as a farewell memorial.

<p>Yang Guanbei and Li Zhenliang, members of the preparatory committee of the Federation, hosted the press at the Bank Club at 6:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the progress of the preparations and the mission of establishing the Federation. According to Li Yunliang, since the restoration, the Chinese people's understanding of the shipping industry has gradually deepened, and their interest has become stronger, so that the precarious shipping industry has regained its bright and lively atmosphere. Recalling the history of China's shipping industry, the ninety-five years from the Treaty of Nanjing to the beginning of the War of Resistance were a period of aggression, the eight years of the War of Resistance were a period of sacrifice and stagnation, and after the victory, it entered a stage of revival. Now that the Federation has been established, it will gather the strength of the whole country to solve various basic problems for the revival of the shipping industry.</p>
<p>The Most Important Tasks Can Be Divided into Five Points</p>
<p>Its most important tasks can be divided into five points: (1) The development of China's shipping industry has now entered an important stage, internally to maintain the navigation rights of inland rivers and coastal areas, and externally to seek the development of overseas shipping to replace the positions of various countries, especially Japan, in the Far East shipping industry in the past. (2) To establish a modern and sound shipping business, innovate business operations, and abolish the traditional corrupt system of compradores in the past. (3) To carry out various undertakings related to the shipping industry, such as shipbuilding and training of navigation talents, handling insurance, and building wharves and warehouses. (4) To assist the government to catch up with the world's shipping standards, such as ship inspections, safety, mutual recognition, and exchange of information. Participate in all international shipping conferences, so as to establish close ties with the shipping industries of various countries, in order to meet the standards of the World Maritime Safety Conference. (5) To seek contact between the same industry and with various industries. Finally, he also said: Shanghai's ship tonnage accounts for more than 80% of the country, with a total tonnage of 658,880.85 tons. In the future, China's shipping industry will still be centered on Shanghai. Regarding the fuel required by the shipping industry, Li Yunliang reported at last night's press conference that the required kerosene and oil have been agreed with the oil company to be supplied regularly by the company. However, the use of coal is currently increased by 20%, and a 200-ton ship requires 10 million yuan for coal, which is really unbearable, and the problem is extremely serious.</p>

<h3>Soliciting Names for the Chuiwanlou Poetry Collection; The Literary World Responds</h3>
<p>Gao Chuiwanlou of Jinshan is highly regarded for his ancient poetry and prose. He encountered turmoil in Wuyin; his collection of books was almost completely looted, and his poetry and prose manuscripts could not be collected in time, resulting in simultaneous loss. Fortunately, the manuscripts were saved by his disciples. The following year, they were published in eighteen volumes as the Chuiwanlou Anthology, and those who heard about it competed to buy them. Not many were printed, and they were soon sold out. In the seven or eight years since then, he has been living at sea, and he has written more and more poems. He has specially inspected his recent works, and has searched extensively for those collected by friends near and far, as well as those scattered in old publications and remaining drafts, and has obtained several volumes, the total number of which is roughly equal to the Anthology. Now, Shen Siqi and Jin Lanqi, fellow villagers, and others, plan to print 1,000 copies of the Chuiwanlou Poetry Collection. The estimated cost of labor and materials is about 50 million yuan. It is currently soliciting widely from all walks of life. If you wish to subscribe, please contact Shen Siqi at the World Book Company before the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>(1) Two Husbands Competing for a Concubine</p>
<p>Zhu Junxin of Changshu asks: My friend Zhang Jun cohabited with a woman named Li in the spring of the 27th year. She was originally a concubine of Xu. During the incident, Li and Xu fled and were separated. Due to livelihood problems, Li and my friend Zhang Jun cohabited. Now Xu has returned home and urged Ms. Li to return to reunite. There are three doubts. Please give instructions: (1) My friend Zhang Jun has cohabited with Ms. Li for ten years. If Xu insists that Ms. Li return home to reunite, and Ms. Li is unwilling to go, and Zhang Jun also refuses, what legal responsibility does he have? (2) Ms. Li and Xu have a daughter, who is now twelve years old. When she returned to her mother's home, she was only two years old. All the expenses for upbringing and education were borne by Zhang Jun. Now Xu wants his daughter to be taken back and raised by himself. Can Zhang Jun refuse? Otherwise, can he ask for the return of living expenses (from the age of two to twelve)? (3) Ms. Li's biological mother is still alive. Li is now 32 years old. When she was 18 years old, her father passed away, and she was abducted and sold to Xu as a concubine by her father's concubine without the consent of her biological mother. Can the biological mother now come forward to accuse the concubine of abduction?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) The concubine system is not stipulated in the current civil law because it does not conform to the principle of equality between men and women. The woman does not want to be a concubine and can sever relations with the head of the family at any time (see Supreme Court Judgment No. 1437, 20th year). (2) The biological father taking back an illegitimate child cannot be refused by anyone. Zhang has adopted Xu's daughter for ten years and already has the relationship of an adoptive father. The Civil Law does not stipulate that an adopted child restores his original surname and restores the relationship between his biological father and daughter when the adoption relationship is terminated. The adoptive father can request the biological father to compensate for the damage. (3) Li's concubine slightly lured her away from the family. The highest degree of punishment is imprisonment of up to seven years. The statute of limitations for prosecution is ten years. Now it has been fourteen years, and there is no right to prosecute.</p>
<p>(2) Overstepping One's Authority</p>
<p>Ye Jiejun: My friend A and woman B fell in love, but B's parents accepted a betrothal gift of 1 million yuan from C. Now woman B wants to marry man A regardless of her parents' opposition. However, there are several legal questions. Please answer: (1) Is it illegal for A and B to marry on their own? (2) B returns the engagement gift to C. If C refuses to accept it, how should it be handled? (3) Can C demand compensation from B? (4) If B is not of legal age (19 years old), can she choose to marry herself? (5) Does C have the right to sue B's parents?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] The marriage contract should be made by the man and woman themselves. It is of course invalid for parents to make a marriage contract on behalf of their underage children. Therefore, in this case (1) A and B can marry, but if B is a minor, she should obtain the consent of her legal representative. (2) No reason to refuse to accept. (3) If there is no other damage, compensation cannot be demanded. (4) If B is under 20 years old, whether she is engaged or married, she must obtain the consent of her legal representative. (5) It should depend on whether C has other damages.</p>

<h3>Maha Team Defender Chen Jiasu Joins Sing Tao, Sing Tao Loses to Maha, Original General Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hong Kong Aviation News] Since its expedition, the Tiger Team has not encountered a worthy opponent. When it reached Singapore, it suffered its first defeat, losing 3-1 to the Malay Overseas Chinese team. After careful research, it turned out that three forwards were injured: wingers Qiu Ting and He Yingfen were injured, and Zhang Jinhai also had problems. Therefore, they had to use Gao Shanlong as the right winger and Liu Songsheng as the left winger.</p>
<p>This adjustment caused problems. Liu and Gao were transferred from the defense to the front, which loosened the defense and made the attack less effective, resulting in a defeat.</p>
<p>I said long ago that this technical expeditionary force lacked wingers, and it turned out to be true.</p>
<p>Now news comes that Chen Jiasu, the best right back of the Maha team, is accompanying Sing Tao on their expedition to England. This will strengthen the defense further, but what about the forwards? Worries, worries!</p>
<p>In this expeditionary force, there is a Western general, Gao Shanlong - that is, Xiao Gaoshan slave. This man's football skills are good. He and his brother Da Gaoshan slave dominate Hong Kong. Li Huitang is only like that (Xiao Gaoshan slave has been the Hong Kong Port Team captain eight times). He plays very well in every position on the football team.</p>
<p>Now he is accompanying the army on the expedition, playing a few left backs and has established special merits, worthy of a famous general.</p>
<p>Zhu Yongqiang was originally a good inside forward for South China. This time, he joined Sing Tao's expedition to Europe, playing center forward and left winger. Especially after playing two or three left winger games, he grabbed a lot of attention. "Little Zhu" has a very good basic skills. If he can strive for progress, his position will be indispensable in the future World Games selection.</p>
<p>Among a group of "veteran" players, one who can still maintain the position is "God Leg" Feng Jingxiang, and the other is "Iron Leg" Sun Jinshun. One "God" and one "Iron" still have the "stage style" of the World Games era, and the style remains the same.</p>
<p>Now "God Leg" is leading the army again, not only the central leader of the entire army, but also cleanly shooting a few goals from outside the twenty-yard line. The famous general has his own skills.</p>

<h3>Lixing Middle School Raises Funds to Hold Small Ball Charity Match</h3>
<p>Lixing Middle School in this city has a good reputation and produces many talents. Sports stars such as Meng Yiliang, Tao Tingfu, Wang Jinghu, Wang Zhenglin, Guan Anda, and Wang Xuewu are all alumni. The school was successfully restored. Since Zhou Zenglin has been the principal, he has been actively building the school. However, funds are lacking. Now the alumni have launched a fundraising small-scale football charity match between the alumni team and the Soviet Union. It is scheduled to be held at the Ningnian Corps Branch Stadium on the second southern section of Zhongzheng Road this month on the 6th (weekend). The proceeds from the tickets will all be used to fund the construction of the school building.</p>
<h3>Ping Pong Finals Act V Shanghai Star vs. You Yi Tonight Finals Fourth Game Jingwu Narrowly Wins Green Team</h3>
<p>The fourth game of the second Shanghai Ping Pong League's Top 8 Finals was held at 8:00 p.m. the night before at the Central Auditorium. The two-part champion Jingwu faced the fourth-part runner-up Green Team. There were more than 400 spectators. Jingwu has the ambition to win the championship this year and has great strength. However, it was greatly threatened by the new army Green Team that night, which was unexpected. When the battle started, Jingwu charged with the main force, unstoppable, and won three camps in a row. In the fourth group, Jingwu's all-around master Yang Kaiyun performed abnormally. Opponent Chen Yinzhou reversed the defeat and defeated Yang Kaiyun by three to two, which can be called a masterpiece. Yang's carelessness was defeated and almost affected the overall situation. In the fifth and sixth groups, the Green Team quickly caught up and won successively, tying the score at three each. In the final group, Jingwu relied on Gao Hongxing's steady shot and won Li Rongji, the Green Team's slicer, by three to one, laying the foundation for victory. As a result, Jingwu defeated the Green Team by four to three. The upset did not happen, which can be said to be dangerous.</p>
<p>Tonight from 8:00 p.m., the fifth game of the finals will be held at the original location. Shanghai Star will face You Yi. The referees are Chen Linsheng and Shao Yiyuan, and the record is Chen Zuguo. Shanghai Star has many talents, and You Yi is not its enemy. However, if they can deal with Shanghai Star with the spirit of the last battle against Hualian, there may be an excellent performance at that time. The results of the night before are as follows:</p>
<p>(Jingwu) (Green Team) (Score)</p>
<p>Zhang Fuwei Li Peiran Three——〇</p>
<p>Ouyang Wei Chen Yilong Three——〇</p>
<p>Chen Huiliang Wang Yishan Three——One</p>
<p>Yang Kaiyun Chen Yinzhou Two——Three</p>
<p>Xu Sunjia Qin Duyan One——Three</p>

<h3>Spinning Regulation Committee Gathers National and Private Yarn Factories to Thoroughly Implement Joint Distribution, Aiming to Eliminate Black Markets and Crack Down on Hoarding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Spinning Regulation Committee has distributed cotton yarn for hoarding. Yesterday, China Textile Construction Corporation continued to distribute 301 pieces of yarn, all of which were distributed to the cotton yarn copying industry. A total of 147 purchase orders were submitted by various factories.</p>
<p>The committee wrote to continue to plan how to thoroughly implement joint pricing. With a view to jointly distributing the manufacturing industry, a small group meeting on the sales of finished products was specially convened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Currently, the temporary measure is that each national and private yarn factory provides 10,000 pieces of yarn for distribution, which must be paid in full before the 15th of this month. Before the joint distribution name is organized, the original staff of China Textile Construction Corporation will temporarily distribute and sell it according to the company's original sales method. As for how to make the yarn produced by national and private yarn factories be handed over to the joint distribution agency of the Spinning Regulation Committee, and how to supply and sell cotton yarn from other places, all must be stipulated from the beginning so that the implementation can be followed. The private factories mainly advocate joint pricing and individual distribution in order to maintain the business freedom of each factory. However, in order to implement the joint distribution system, the Spinning Regulation Committee allows private factories to take more responsibility for the organization of the future joint distribution agency, and even the distribution agency can be set up in the No. 6 District Cotton Textile Association. However, the joint distribution system must be thoroughly implemented. In short, under this basic distribution system, all yarn produced by national and private yarn factories is concentrated and distributed by the joint distribution Yangliu. Each yarn to be distributed must be approved by the Spinning Regulation Committee in advance to prevent abuses, and one distribution price will be used to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating black markets and cracking down on hoarding. It is reported that the opinions at yesterday's meeting were quite harmonious, and Gu's attending members expressed that the position of the Spinning Regulation Committee could be accepted for consideration. It is reported that important decisions on the detailed rules for the joint distribution system are expected to be made before the 7th of this month.</p>
<p>[Another News] According to relevant parties, after the government supplies cotton to Xingzongshi and imports 60 million U.S. dollars of foreign cotton in the first and second quarters, it will decide on new policies based on the results of the current cotton yarn regulation measures. It is reported that if the current joint distribution system is not ideal, the policy of spinning and weaving on behalf of the third quarter's quota import of foreign cotton may be adopted. At that time, the central government will supply raw materials and entrust each factory to spin cotton yarn on its behalf, and pay each factory reasonable unprofitability.</p>
<h3>Operators Stick to Old Methods, Pig Bristle Exports Are Sluggish, Hankou Goods Are Currently the Most Popular</h3>
<p>It is worth paying attention to the sharp decline in our country's foreign trade. Taking the main export product, pig bristles, as an example, according to the famous manufacturers engaged in this business, such as Sichuan's Chang Chan, Chongde, Feng, and Heyuan, the export quantity in the previous month was only 15% of that in April, and the turnover in the previous month was rare. This phenomenon not only affects the national treasury's income, but also the international market position will gradually decline. The government authorities have long been concerned about this and have instructed the Central Trust Bureau to organize an export commodity price review committee to assist exporters.</p>
<p>According to the leader of the pig bristle industry, the sluggishness of our country's pig bristle trade is not only due to (1) high domestic costs, rising market prices, (2) rampant smuggling, and falling prices for dumping. (3) Overseas market prices have reached saturation, and buyers are difficult to turn good under the US government's price stabilization policy. The biggest knot is that the operators in our country (1) lack modern scientific methods in manufacturing methods, (2) their sales methods cannot grasp the psychology of those in need, and they simply follow the old ways, cut corners, and gradually reduce the past glorious history. If they do not seek thorough improvement, they will face a crisis of falling into decline. The most obvious phenomenon at present is: (1) The size is not standard enough, (2) The flexibility is not uniform, (3) The gloss is poor. In short, they are all too far away from using scientific methods. Among them, the most arduous flexibility test work often relies on experienced personnel to judge only by the feeling of holding it with fingers and palms. How can it maintain a permanent balance? Its failure can be known.</p>
<p>The most valuable of the seventeen types of pig bristles is the "No. 27 distribution box", and its size ranges from two inches to six inches. The best origin in our country is Tianjin, with long, moist, and extremely high-quality hair. Most of these goods are transported from the northwest, which is caused by the cold climate in cold regions. During the war, northwest goods were changed to enter Chongqing, creating Sichuan bristles, which were famous overseas. At that time, most of them were exported to the United States and the Soviet Union as military supplies for washing guns and mouths. After the victory, Hankou bristles were quite popular in the United States because of their uniform flexibility, so the current Chongqing goods only sell for 2.6 cents per pound in the United States, while Hankou goods sell for 3.3 cents. The spokesman also said that Americans are fickle and like the new and dislike the old. Now the raw materials for toothbrush bristles are often abandoning pig bristles and replacing them with artificial "nylon" finished products, which is another blow to the export sales of pig bristles in our country.</p>
<h3>Various Cotton Textiles Will Implement Price Negotiation</h3>
<p>After the Textile Business Regulation Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs set new price negotiations for each branch of cotton yarn and implemented the cotton yarn joint distribution policy, the market will resume trading today and will buy and sell at a legal profit of 5% on top of the new negotiated price. It is reported that in order to stabilize the prices of general cotton textile products, the authorities will also stipulate negotiated prices for various cotton textiles such as cotton cloth shirts, socks, and towels based on the negotiated prices of cotton yarn and add reasonable profits so that merchants know what to follow.</p>
<p>If they exceed the negotiated price and attempt to obtain exorbitant profits, they will also be severely punished. This method is in preparation.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Universal Sale of US Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>Formal Treasury Bonds to be Printed by Early Next Month</p>
<p>The subscription tickets for U.S. Treasury bonds have recently seen a surge in sales. The fundraising committee has decided to continue expanding sales, with a large-scale campaign aimed at the general public across all social strata. The formal Treasury bonds are currently being rushed into print in Shanghai. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, recently made another special trip to Shanghai to inspect the printing progress. It is expected that printing will be completed by early next month, and the subscription tickets originally issued will be exchanged. Once the formal Treasury bonds are issued, they may be immediately listed on the exchange's bond market to facilitate their use by holders.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market continued to show weakness. This was because the Economic Council had decided to begin a thorough investigation of prices today, which would impact speculators, causing anxiety. In addition, the banks' holiday period had ended, and those short on funds frequently resorted to selling off their stock, resulting in a step-by-step decline in quoted prices. Ten-cigarette packs of "British American Tobacco" (BAT) brands were traded extensively at prices as low as 7.28 million yuan. Twenty-cigarette packs of BAT brands were more resilient, and their base remained firm. In the afternoon session, retail sales showed slight movement, with ten-cigarette packs of BAT brands eventually recovering to 7.3 million yuan, a drop of 55,000 yuan from the previous day. "Old Knife" brand cigarettes also fell by 50,000 yuan to 6.3 million yuan. "Five Hua" brand cigarettes were reportedly being actively traded by foreign dealers, rising 30,000 yuan to 5.61 million yuan. "Haddemen" remained steady at 5.31 million yuan. Throughout the day, more transactions were conducted in domestic Chinese cigarettes, especially in the "Surprise" series. Due to reduced factory output and delays in delivery, the supply of these brands was tight, resulting in a particularly firm base.</p>
<p>Furthermore, American-made "Six Camel", "Marlboro", and other brands of packaged cigarettes, as well as fifty-cigarette tins of "Craven A" and "Three Fives", saw very little activity, with few buyers and a sluggish market. "Craven A" cigarettes could be traded for as little as 58,000 yuan, and "Three Fives" only attracted buyers at 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales by the "Spinning &amp; Construction" Company</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the "Spinning &amp; Construction" Company encountered the bank closing holiday for settlement, it still opened for yarn sales as usual. There were eight types of yarn available, with prices similar to those announced by the "Spinning Regulation Committee" on the 29th. Specifically, 10-count "Yang He" cone yarn was priced at 6,120 yuan (unit: 1,000 yuan); 16-count "Harvest Year" large package at 7,740 yuan; 20-count "Li Ma" large package at 8,800 yuan; 32-count "Xian Tao" cone yarn at 12,940 yuan; 40-count "Shi Guang" bundled package at 15,230 yuan; 42-count double-strand "Blue Phoenix" large package at 17,240 yuan; 60-count "Sunlight" cone yarn at 22,500 yuan; and 80-count double-strand "TK" multicolored ball large package at 49,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Minor Fluctuations in Soap Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the soap market for daily necessities, "Lever" medicated soap produced by the China Soap Company was in high demand due to the summer season, with brisk activity that surpassed "Huang Xiangmao" brand. Market sentiment was also buoyant. Quoted prices reportedly rose to 467,000 yuan per case, with very few sellers. Laundry soap saw some selling-off of old stock in the morning, causing prices to decline. The afternoon session was more active, with sporadic purchases. "Gu Ben" soap eventually recovered 10,000 yuan from the day before yesterday, reaching 470,000 yuan. "Arrow Knife" rose 5,000 yuan. "Huang Xiangmao" 220-bar cases also increased 10,000 yuan to 308,000 yuan. "Bai Xiangmao" 160-bar cases surged 45,000 yuan to 360,000 yuan. "Guang Hua" soap also rose 25,000 yuan. Other brands such as "Henry", "Cow Brand", and "Ding Feng" all rose between 20,000 and 25,000 yuan. The match market remained largely unchanged, with "Chicken Brand" wax candles standing firm at 280,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Kerosene Market. Transactions were generally stable, but with abundant inventory, selling-off continued. Prices were nominally stable but actually softening. "High-grade" barrel oil could be traded at around 150,000 yuan, while "Mobil" canned oil was at 97,000 to 98,000 yuan. However, the price of oil dregs increased slightly, ranging from 2,200 to 2,300 yuan per ladle.</p>
<p>Shortage of Oils and Fats Leads to Price Increases</p>
<p>The market prices of raw materials for soap and candles, such as asphalt and tallow, have been soaring recently, with increases of over 200% in just a few days, causing market confusion. According to industry insiders: the fats and oils business is normally slow during the summer months, with very sluggish transactions and reduced inventories at production sites. Soap and candle manufacturers have traditionally stockpiled enough raw materials before summer to last through the slow season. However, in recent years, due to the instability of the economic and social environment, this seasonal habit has been disrupted. New supplies must wait until after the autumn cool-down before they can be put on the market, while current inventories are dwindling, leading to price increases, competitive buying, and a speculative market, which is harming the public's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Calico Market Slightly Firmer</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was some activity in the cotton cloth market outside the venue, and calico was slightly firmer than before the break. The quoted price for 12-pound "Dragon Head" calico was 442,000 yuan, while bleached cloth, "Yuan Bu" and dark blue "Shi Bu" remained stable. The "Water Moon" and "Leaping Carp" bleached cloth supplied by "Spinning &amp; Construction" the day before yesterday both saw price increases of 3,000 yuan. "Leaping Carp" gray raw twill increased by 4,000 yuan, while "Four Gentlemen" gold-seal "Yuan Bi" decreased by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Gold Imports Purchased with US Dollars; Hong Kong Government Controls US Dollars; Exporters to Face Significant Impact</h3>
<p>(United Press Hong Kong, 2nd) Hong Kong has decided to make efforts to reduce the consumption of US dollars and, due to the increasingly serious global shortage of US dollars, has decided to make efforts to increase the available supply. The government has already promulgated a number of orders. It prohibits the import of gold purchased with US dollars, prohibits the public market from setting up US dollars as funds for imported goods, and designates several banks. 25% of the US dollars settled for certain exports should be available for government use.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's import and export trade in the five months of 1947 had more imports than exports, with a difference of approximately US$25,000,000, most of which was remitted in US dollars. Importers and exporters of goods imported from the dollar area have been warned by the government that due to the shrinking US dollar supply in Hong Kong, these expenditures will be more strictly restricted.</p>
<p>Up to now, the impact has been limited to items obtained from the United States, such as plastic products, radios, electrical supplies, lubricants, lighters, and similar miscellaneous items. The prohibition of gold imports held at the same time has the dual effect of reducing the consumption of US dollars and satisfying the Chinese government's protest that these goods are breaking through China's tariff barriers and being imported into China to evade taxes.</p>
<p>The recently announced stricter ban, which affects all exporters, is likely to be even greater. This ban stipulates that exporters of tung oil, tin, and rubber to the dollar area will sell 25% of the US dollar exchange settlement to the government at the official price of 4 Hong Kong dollars equal to 1 US dollar (the open market is 4.65 Hong Kong dollars equal to 1 US dollar).</p>
<p>Exports to the United States in the first five months of this year reached approximately US$10,000,000, accounting for 65% of total exports to the United States. Therefore, if the tung oil market is stable, the Hong Kong government is expected to earn a monthly income of US$500,000 from tung oil exports alone.</p>
<p>Some traders obtain US dollars by importing rubber from Malaya and re-exporting it to the United States, because rubber can be freely imported into Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong has already used a large amount of US dollars to pay for the cotton yarn sold by the Allied Headquarters and American commercial companies, merchants here expect that transactions in US dollars will be further restricted.</p>
<h3>Revival of Japanese Textile Industry; Hong Kong Merchants Worried</h3>
<p>(United Press Hong Kong, 2nd) According to commercial sources, the recovery of private commerce in Japan from August 15 and the policies adopted by Japan when it re-enters the world textile market have caused anxiety among cloth merchants here. They are deeply afraid that Japan's recent monthly production of 1.4 million yards of cloth will be sold on the cloth market after accumulation. The Allied Headquarters' permission for Japan to overproduce has now caused the danger of a tragic price war. The only remedy is to distribute Japan's accumulated textiles for domestic consumption. In the past 18 months, Hong Kong merchants have exported a large number of textiles to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. It is reported that the region is now turning to Japan to order a large number of textiles.</p>
<h3>City Bank Establishes Fifth Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Bank was previously approved by the Municipal Government to establish a fifth office at 1124 Daming Road. It is now learned that the office has been prepared and will officially open tomorrow (4th). In addition to handling various banking businesses, it will also act as an agent for the Shanghai Municipal Treasury's revenue and expenditure matters.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Societies Illegally Engage in Deposit and Loan Business; Municipal Government Ordered to Ban Them</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures and strengthen the control of financial undertakings, the Ministry of Finance has designated Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Jinan, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Suzhou, Yongjia, Kunming, and other seventeen regions as locations for restricting the resumption of business by commercial firms and the establishment of branch offices. However, the Ministry of Finance has recently received reports that many unscrupulous individuals in various places are openly engaged in ordinary deposit and loan business in the name of credit cooperatives, in order to circumvent regulations, hinder normal financial business, and greatly affect social and economic security. They are no different in nature from the "underground banks" that are established without authorization, and should be strictly banned in order to rectify the situation. After receiving the above instructions, the Municipal Government has issued orders to its subordinate units to handle the matter accordingly.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Start Work on Schedule</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Association has decided that all silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang must start work by the 15th of this month. Regarding the fuel, coal, and petroleum required by each factory, the association has listed the amount needed by each factory and the date of commencement of work reported by the silk reeling guilds in the three regions and sent them to the Fuel Management Committee and the China Petroleum Company, hoping that they will be approved and allocated quickly so that each factory can start work on schedule. In addition, the association has also telegraphed the Four Banks Joint Office to request that 84 billion yuan be approved and loaned in advance for the funds required for the commencement of work of each silk factory.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics and Bedding Market Quietly Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for overcoat woolen fabrics was quietly booming, with both local and out-of-town merchants needing to purchase them. Fine-wool, high-quality floral woolen fabrics were also in greater demand than supply in the tea room market. Zhang Hua's merino wool fabrics were priced at 400,000 yuan per yard, with a 70% down payment required. The spot price was 370,000 to 380,000 yuan. Rainproof cloth was in demand in Guangdong and Guangxi due to the rainy season. Yesterday, more than 3,000 yards of white yarn twill were traded, purchased by Mai Qiangsi, who was commissioned by the Road Bureau to make uniforms.</p>
<h3>Fuel Subsidy Canceled; Fuel Management Committee Announces New Price; Adjusted to 540,000 per Ton</h3>
<p>After the government decided to stop subsidizing public utilities, fuel prices were adjusted accordingly. It is reported that the new price of coal, which was approved by the Economic Department after being approved by the Fuel Management Committee, is 540,000 yuan per ton, and it took effect on the first of this month. This new price is based on the cost calculation and approval of the mine owners. The cost last month reached 450,000 yuan per ton, while the coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee to public utilities and transportation enterprises was only more than 100,000 yuan per ton, with the government subsidizing more than 200,000 yuan. The adjusted new price is actually the amount that the government should subsidize. Therefore, the adjustment of coal prices is by no means a general price increase. The increase of 540,000 per ton this time is only 90,000 more than last month, less than 15%. The Fuel Management Committee will continue to supply the needs of transportation and public utilities, and will also allocate coal to government employees and teachers.</p>
<h3>To Solve the Coal Shortage in Various Places, a Production Increase Conference Will Be Held</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Fuel Management Committee: The coal shortage in Shanghai has not yet been resolved, and coal shortages have also occurred in various places. The reason for this is that coal is mainly produced in the Northeast. Under the current war situation, it cannot be transported out. If other measures are not taken to solve the problem urgently, the coal shortage will become even more serious. In order to solve the coal shortage, the Economic Department will convene representatives of coal mines from various places in mid-month to hold a "Coal Production Increase Conference" to find ways to increase coal production to meet the needs of the valley. The location of the meeting has not yet been decided, whether it will be in Nanjing or Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Spring Loan Collections in Zhejiang Province Exceed 90,000 Dan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou on the 2nd] The amount of collections from spring loans in Zhejiang Province this year is 91,059 dan, with a total loan of 106,963,984.375 yuan. Approximately 60,000 groups of silkworms were converted into raw silk due to the receipt of the loan. This is an increase of more than one-half compared to last year's production. According to Zhejiang Province, last year's production was 6,194 dan. Regarding the issue of poor germination of silkworm seeds from the Yunnan New Village Company, which caused severe damage to silkworms, it has been decided that the Zhejiang Sericulture Association and the China Sericulture Company will each pay 300 million yuan in compensation. The 300 million yuan from China Sericulture will be offset by this year's autumn seeds or next year's spring seeds.</p>
<h3>Survey of Cotton Merchants' Cotton Inventory in this City Shows a Total of Only 69,027 Dan</h3>
<p>The Cotton Trade Association was recently ordered by Mayor Wu to survey the amount of cotton stored in various warehouses in the city, so as to provide a reference for the Spinning and Adjustment Committee. It is now learned that the survey has been completed. The total amount of cotton stored in the warehouses of various colleagues in the valley is 4,334 pieces of foreign cotton (including large and small packages), totaling 15,456 dan. The total number of domestic cotton (large and small packages) is 14,926 pieces, totaling 53,571 dan, for a total of 69,027 dan. According to Association Chairman Liu, the total amount of cotton stored has been sent to the Municipal Government. However, according to estimates by the Spinning and Adjustment Committee a few days ago, the cotton mills in the city need 30,000 dan of cotton per day, and the current amount is only enough for the yarn mills for two days of raw materials.</p>
<h3>Production Capacity of the Straw Hat Industry in this City Reduced Due to Lack of Raw Materials and Increased Costs</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: There are more than 80 member factories in the Shanghai Straw Hat Association, most of which are small-scale assembly plants, with 535 main operating machines. There are only 11 factories that have the full capacity to manufacture straw hats. Among them, the Xinhua Hat Factory, the Hua Chang Hat Factory, and the Da Lai Flannel Hat Blank Factory are the largest. In addition, there are about 20 factories that make flannel hats from hat blanks. The situation of the industry is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Production capacity: Approximately 550,000 dozens of flannel hats can be produced each year, but this year's output is only about 300,000 dozens. The reasons for the reduction are: (1) high interest rates, (2) high wages, (3) traffic obstruction, and (4) restrictions on the import of wool and rabbit hair. If there are no of the aforementioned four difficulties, and night shifts are added, approximately 1 million dozens can be produced each year.</p>
<p>(2) Sales: The flannel hats produced by the industry are sold in various ports across the country, especially in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and all factories feel that demand exceeds supply. In the past, flannel hats were also sold to Nanyang Siam and other places, but now it is difficult to compete with foreign goods due to the lack of raw materials and increased costs.</p>
<p>(3) Raw materials: According to the survey, the industry works for ten hours a day and uses 180,000 pounds of wool and 3,200 pounds of rabbit hair (or 10,000 pounds of rabbit skin) per month.</p>
<p>It was also found that there is a Da Lai Flannel Factory in the industry, whose exports are rabbit flannel products, and their quality is quite good. It was originally established by an American businessman, and was occupied by the Japanese after the outbreak of the Pacific War. After the victory, it was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After being returned to the original owner, it was run jointly by the original owner and a Chinese national. It is the only rabbit flannel hat blank factory in the country. It has special machines, such as skinning and hair-taking machines, wool-flying machines, wool-carding machines, and wool-blending machines, all of which are made in the United States and can be used. However, the factory has recently been short of rabbit hair or rabbit hair skins (which are more cost-effective than rabbit hair) due to foreign exchange restrictions, and it is on the verge of shutting down. It is hoped that the Transportation Management Committee will consider the actual needs and maintain it.</p>
<h3>Food Prices All Fall Back</h3>
<p>The grain market has turned soft because actual sales are light and there is little absorption. The association's set price is 660,000 to 670,000 yuan for Peruvian sand, 595,000 yuan for 20 medium sand white, down 5,000 yuan. Taiwanese rice is 560,000 yuan. Down 15,000 yuan. Oil rice opened at 420,000 yuan, down more than 10,000 yuan. Rice bran is 400,000 yuan, diao qing is 380,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan. Refined white is 560,000 to 550,000 yuan, and Xingchimen medium rice is 600,000 yuan. All down 10,000 yuan, a total of 370 pieces were traded.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cement Company Holds Shareholders' Meeting</h3>
<p>Li Bake, Chairman of the Shanghai Cement Company, held a shareholders' meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association the day before yesterday to discuss an increase in capital of 8 billion yuan. When the company resumed business in the past, its capital was 5 million yuan. This increase is 1,600 times the original capital. Its product, "Husheng" cement, is of excellent quality and has long been sold throughout the country. It is said that all departments in the factory have been reorganized and will be able to invest soon.</p>
<h3>New Golden Vegetables Will Appear on the Market</h3>
<p>This year's new golden vegetables are more productive, and the inventory here is limited, so they are considered rare when they appear. Only a few dozen pounds of Xuzhou vegetables have arrived in Shanghai, which is not enough to be considered a regular market, and they are sold for 1.37 million yuan. It is reported that the price of Lianzhou mustard produced in Guangdong is 750,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Goal of the Shipping Association is "All within the Four Seas are One Family"</h3>
<p>— Du Yong</p>
<p>Representatives of shipping industry associations from all over the country, holding the great ambition of developing the shipping industry and safeguarding shipping rights, have come all the way to Shanghai to participate in the founding conference of the China National Shipowners' Association (CNSA), and will then go to Nanjing to attend the National Shipping Administration Conference convened by the Ministry of Transportation. This is not only an unprecedented grand event in the history of China's shipping industry, but also a glorious page in the history of nation-building. As the chief representative of Shanghai, I would like to express my sincere welcome on behalf of more than 100 colleagues in Shanghai with an excited mood.</p>
<p>Confucius said: "All within the four seas are brothers." The vast seas and the crisscrossing rivers are the basis for human cultural exchanges and mutual assistance in life. In terms of national power: whoever can develop shipping and utilize the ocean will be strong and prosperous, and full of strength. My country's coastline stretches from the mouth of the Yalu River in the north to Dongxing in Guangzhou Bay in the south, including many islands, with a total of 10,333 miles, or more than 30,000 li. The inland waterways have a total of more than 100,000 li. In the past, they were not fully utilized and were bound by unequal treaties. Shipping rights have been trampled on for more than a century. It is really a disgrace to the Chinese people. Now that shipping rights have been recovered, the national fortune will eventually be revitalized. How to promote shipping construction, how to utilize rivers and seas, and even the public ocean, is really the sacred responsibility of our generation.</p>
<p>Although the situation since the restoration is extremely difficult; although the various problems facing us are heavy, it is the spirit of shipping that is strong, resolute, and far-reaching. We certainly hope that the government and all sectors of society will recognize the importance of shipping and provide special assistance and protection so that it can recover from the wartime destruction. At the same time, we should not ignore the important responsibility we bear for building and saving the country. We will never be isolated, nor will we be decadent. As the Western saying goes, "The crown of honor is woven with thorns." One point of effort, one point of gain. How can the thorns in sight hinder our progress! Only increase everyone's courage to fight. China's rivers and seas, and the world's oceans, are all gardens for us to cultivate. The birth of the Shipping Association—the great union of the national shipping industry—is a call to strengthen cultivation. As long as all within the four seas are one family, and we are in the same boat, will the success of China's preliminary goal of building 3 million tons of merchant ships be far away?</p>
<h3>Origin of Organizing the China National Shipowners' Association</h3>
<p>— Du Yong, Xu Xueyu, Yang Guanbei, Qian Yongming, Lu Zuofu, Shi Fuchang, etc.</p>
<p>The shipping industry is a national and even international public utility. Rivers crisscross and oceans are vast. The exchange of culture and commerce depends on the communication of ships, which is related to the wealth and strength of a country. Most countries take shipping as the foundation of their country, and protect and assist it without reservation. Shipping merchants implement national policies and continue to move forward, thus forming a brilliant and glorious history. Our country was bound by unequal treaties, and shipping rights were lost, and the shipping industry was in decline for a century. Fortunately, our government and people continued to struggle unremittingly, and finally recovered inland river and coastal navigation rights. All Chinese people cherish shipping rights, and are even more obliged to build the shipping industry. Our shipping industry, bearing the burden of the restoration, shoulders the responsibility of revitalization, and should work together to vigorously develop, and seek convenience in water transportation internally, and seek the restoration of shipping rights externally. The tonnage of merchant ships has increased from the remaining 100,000 tons in the early days of the restoration to 800,000 tons. The organization of industry associations in various places is becoming more and more sound; the spirit of industry cooperation is becoming more and more vigorous. In order to strengthen the connection of the national shipping industry, unite the strength of the national shipping industry, promote the development of the shipping industry, and assist the government in the implementation of shipping policies, our association, etc., initiated the organization of the China National Shipowners' Association.</p>
<p>Representatives from various places held a founders' meeting in Shanghai on May 15th of this year. They were united in good faith and had the same idea. The purpose of the organization can be stated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Concentrate the Strength of Shipping Merchants</p>
<p>The shipping industry has a long way to go. It is easy to carry on the past and open up the future. The isolated period of one industry and one place has passed. The era of scientific masses has arrived. There is a need for collective labor to replace the struggle of the lone army, and to unite the strength of the country to solve common problems.</p>
<p>(2) Promote Shipping Construction</p>
<p>The allocation of various ships nationwide, the distribution of shipping routes, the equipment of ports, and the storage and training of talents are all important goals of construction and the focus of the work of this association.</p>
<p>(3) Revitalize Shipping Industry Regulations</p>
<p>The shipping industry is an important social undertaking, and the relationship between the parties is extremely complex. All operations must pay attention to the spirit of the rule of law and scientific methods, in order to seek the revitalization of business management, the elimination of various bad practices, the development of the spirit of service, the reasonableness of maritime responsibilities, and the reduction of personnel disputes.</p>
<p>(4) Safeguard National Shipping Rights</p>
<p>Our country has just recovered its shipping rights. How to safeguard them and how to develop them, so that foreign ships no longer invade our inland rivers and coasts, and further develop overseas shipping, so that our national flag can be flown in the high seas, is an important topic for the national shipping industry.</p>
<p>(5) Connect International Relations</p>
<p>After the establishment of this association, it will work closely with shipping organizations of various countries in the spirit of equality and mutual assistance, participate in all international shipping conferences, and catch up with the world's standards in technology.</p>
<p>The tasks of this association are numerous. What is revealed here is just a brief overview of the main points. The Book says: "Be respectful in your work and harmonious with your neighbors"; a Western proverb also says: "Unity is strength"; our national shipping industry is united in one heart, determined to make all within the four seas one family, revitalize the great cause, and help each other in the same boat, protect shipping rights forever, and persevere. Please start from here!</p>

<h3>The Distinctive Characteristics of Shipping Industry Competition</h3>
<p>— Li Yunliang</p>
<p>Since Queen Elizabeth used force to break the closed-sea policies of Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands at the time, countries have limited their control over the ocean to the extent of their territorial waters, namely the ocean within three nautical miles of the coastline. According to the theory of natural law and international law, the ocean beyond territorial waters should be the common property of mankind, which is the so-called high seas policy. To this day, the British still take pride in their Queen's famous saying: "The ocean and the air should be for the common use of mankind, and sovereignty over the ocean cannot belong to any country or private individual." Among the 138 million square miles of water on the globe, rivers, lakes, and marshes account for only one million square miles, and the area of territorial waters is also extremely limited. Therefore, the majority of the water surface is the high seas, which everyone can freely utilize. This kind of maritime freedom is the prerequisite for the expansion of the shipping industry and the development of civilization. Since the mercantile era of the 17th and 18th centuries, adventurous voyages and colonial companies have sprung up, and the tonnage of merchant ships has increased day by day. Although railways also rose one after another after the Industrial Revolution, waterways are more economical in terms of nature, engineering, distance, and investment. Taking coal consumption as an example: statistics show that railways require 0.066 pounds per ton-mile, while ships require only 0.029 pounds. Therefore, railways can only supplement waterways and cannot replace them. However, due to the vast scope of activities and low equipment costs of the shipping industry itself, its business nature is also what is called a "hollow business" - regardless of the number of goods and passengers carried, the cost of navigation is roughly the same. Therefore, it inherently has a high degree of competitiveness. Furthermore, due to commercial warfare, countries compete with countries, and companies compete with companies. As competition intensifies, profits inevitably decrease, and even losses occur, making it impossible to survive. When both sides are hurt, they cooperate to maintain freight rates. The history of the shipping industry over the past hundred years is almost like the warning sentence at the beginning of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms: "That which has long been divided must unite, and that which has long been united must divide." Division is competition; unity is cooperation. Moreover, as a general rule, cooperation is often a means of competition, such as uniting ships on the same route to cope with external competition, which is division and unity.</p>
<p>The most common form of competition in the shipping industry is price competition. For example, before the war, the ticket price for ships on the Shanghai-Taizhou route once fell to fifty cents per passenger, with shipowners providing meals and giving away a towel each. The freight rate for flour shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin once fell to three cents per bag, with shipowners bearing the cost of loading and unloading. The freight rate for miscellaneous grains from Shanghai to the United States also once had a record of four yuan per ton.</p>
<p>If a foreign ship joins the route, the original shipowners want to resist it. In terms of competitive strategy, there is a so-called Fighting Ship, that is, in addition to the original ship, one or several similar ships are equipped to sail at the same time, and the freight rate is specially reduced, so that all the goods and passengers that were intended to be shipped by the new company are seized. The new company, which is in its infancy and lacks strength, is bound to withdraw halfway or make concessions and negotiate.</p>
<p>The Deferred Rebate System is also a unique means of monopolistic competition. In order to maintain customers' exclusive shipment of goods and prevent them from declaring shipment on other companies' ships, a certain company or companies on a certain route can agree or state with customers: if all goods are shipped on the company's ships during the specified period (usually six months), the company will give a rebate of a certain percentage (usually 10%) of the freight paid at the end of the period. If the goods have been entrusted to other ships for transportation without the company's consent, no rebate will be given. There are also those who encourage customers to ship more goods without limiting the total number of shipments, and often adopt a progressive deferred rebate method, stipulating several levels of standards, such as giving a 10% rebate for a total freight amount of 5 million yuan during a certain period; giving a 15% rebate for 10 million yuan; and giving a 20% rebate for 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Another method similar to the period deduction system is to sign long-term shipping contracts with customers to give them preferential prices and convenient procedures.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned competition methods have been implemented on the Yangtze River route, on the coastal routes, and on the Pacific and Atlantic routes. In addition, there are those who compete in service, such as handling pick-up and drop-off services, tidying up the stewards' services, booking tickets by phone, arranging sea, land and air combined transportation, and buying and selling goods on behalf of customers, etc., which are different from the struggle and crowding with the spirit of service.</p>
<p>Here, we should emphasize that unrestrained competition in the shipping industry can often weaken the strength of competitors, leading to mutual losses and the inability to extricate themselves. Moreover, competition in the shipping industry is not necessarily about the survival of the fittest, but often inferior ships take risks and make a small profit, causing good ships to suffer endlessly, just like the law of "bad money drives out good money" in economics. New and good ships are strongly structured, well-equipped, and cost hundreds of millions of yuan, while hiring excellent crew members, sailing according to scheduled routes, and ensuring safety and convenience naturally cost more. If someone disregards the overall situation of the shipping industry and only seeks personal gain, buys old ships that can barely sail for tens of millions of yuan, or even temporarily charters ships at a lower price, and joins routes with suitable or excessive supply and demand with simple equipment and inferior crew members, and lowers prices to compete for customers, because their ships are inferior and the capital is light, they can often fall to half price or less. The general customers only covet cheapness and disregard safety, and are bound to flock to them, while the original liner business is taken away by them and difficult to maintain. If it lasts for a long time, good ships will be replaced by inferior ships. This phenomenon is especially common in countries with an underdeveloped shipping industry like ours. This kind of competitive ships often appear on the near-sea routes of Shanghai, so new and good ships are as rare as phoenix feathers, not seen for years, which is really an internal cancer of shipping construction and should be treated urgently.</p>

<h3>Shakespeare's Translator</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>The Complete Works of Shakespeare's Plays (total of four volumes: Volume 1 Comedies, Volume 2 Tragedies, Volume 3 Problem Plays, Volume 4 Historical Plays) Translated by Zhu Shenghao Published by World Book Company</p>
<p>The thick three volumes of Shakespeare's complete works are placed on my desk. I stared at these huge volumes for a while, dumbfounded. Brother Shenghao's ten years of hard work have finally been published. My heart is full of mixed emotions of surprise, remembrance, and loss. I don't know whether I should recommend this great translation or introduce this unparalleled but obscure translator.</p>
<p>To borrow a common phrase, Shakespeare is too great, and I am too insignificant. There is no need to add more words to Shakespeare's lyrics that "cover the world and surpass the ages." Secondly, my English is simply a smattering. When reading Shakespeare's original works, I often have a sense of being unable to understand them. As for carefully comparing the original text with the translation to show that I am also a well-versed researcher, how dare I! However, considering that there have been many translations of Shakespeare's masterpieces, and Professor Cao Weifeng published a complete translation a year or two ago, I don't know which of Professor Cao and Brother Shenghao started translating Shakespeare's complete works first, nor do I know which of them spent more time. A fair criticism of the two translations requires literary experts and teachers who are well-versed in literature, and I, who am ignorant, am not allowed to praise or criticize them indiscriminately. However, my point is that if someone has long admired Shakespeare's masterpieces but has been unable to study the original text, Brother Shenghao's fluent and beautiful complete translation is worth recommending. Please read the translator's self-declaration to understand his painstaking efforts in translating (although the self-declaration is in classical Chinese, the play lyrics in the complete works are clear and colloquial):</p>
<p>The purpose of my translation of this book is, first, to preserve the spirit of the original work to the greatest possible extent; if I have to settle for second best, I must also use clear and understandable words to faithfully convey the meaning of the original text... I must make the author's intention clearly revealed and not obscured by obscure words. After translating each paragraph, I must first pretend to be a reader and check whether there are any ambiguous or unclear points in the translation, and I must also pretend to be an actor on the stage to examine whether the tone is smooth and whether the rhythm is harmonious. I often pondered over a word or sentence for days.</p>
<p>The above words are not at all boastful. Brother Shenghao is indeed a hardworking and extremely serious person. Now, facing this huge volume, I close my eyes, and the image of a gentle and refined young scholar still appears before my eyes: a tall and thin figure, a fair face, a gentle and silent demeanor, rarely saying a word or two, followed by a blush, he has an extremely introverted personality, not a celebrity but a typical poet. When he works and reads, he puts his whole energy into it, often forgetting to eat and sleep. Socializing and fame are not related to this indifferent poet.</p>
<p>A Silent Worker</p>
<p>Over ten years of translation work, what he has experienced are years of hardship and suffering! I remember that Brother Shenghao and I were classmates in middle school. Because he was two grades above me, we knew each other but were not familiar. After graduating, he entered Zhijiang University and always got the best grades. In the spring of 1935, I went to work at the editorial department of World Book Company, and only then did I meet Brother Shenghao again. At that time, we were all working in the English department, and the director was our old teacher, Mr. Zhan Wenhuhu. Brother Shenghao's writing desk was next to mine, and because of the connection in work, the manuscripts I translated and wrote were often handed to him before the ink was dry, and he would carefully correct them with a red ink pen. He was the most silent person in the office, often not saying a word all day long. When others asked him to chat, he would always respond with a kind smile, followed by a blush, and then it was over. His plan to translate Shakespeare's complete works began in the spring of 1935, and was encouraged by Mr. Zhan. However, he never let anyone know that he was trying to do this work. Others only saw him running to bookstores, diligently collecting various versions of Shakespeare's plays and books with commentaries, criticisms, and textual research from various scholars.</p>
<p>Meeting in Chaos, Only Carrying Shakespeare</p>
<p>When the August 13th Incident broke out, I took my family back to my hometown of Xinshi for the summer vacation, but I couldn't get out because of it, and temporarily took refuge in my old home. Then, the Japanese army landed in Hangzhou, and along the two railway lines, people were panic-stricken and made plans to evacuate. In mid-November, on a gloomy and cold afternoon, suddenly an unexpected guest came to visit my home. It was the tall and thin, refined Shenghao. Meeting in chaos, I was overjoyed. We talked for a long time before I learned that he had come here with his family to take refuge. The editorial department of World Book Company was in the Tilanqiao district. He said that on the eve of the storm, he had fled in a hurry in the middle of the night, leaving behind all his luggage, only carrying an original copy of Shakespeare's complete works and his own translated manuscripts. At the critical moment, he thought this was the most precious! I asked him what his plan was for the future. He said that he planned to move to the countryside for a short stay, and if life could be stabilized, he would concentrate on translating. We chatted happily, and he told me the whole process and plan of translating the complete works. In addition to admiring him, I had nothing to say.</p>
<p>The next time I met Brother Shenghao was in Shanghai, which had become an isolated island. Twice it was in Garden Village, and twice it was in the editorial department of the Sino-American Daily. At that time, he was a newspaper reporter who was fighting the enemy and puppets with paper bullets, and he was also the most capable assistant of Editor-in-Chief Zhan Wenhuhu. In casual conversations during occasional meetings, I learned that he still remembered the translation work, but he was too busy with official duties and had no spare time!</p>
<p>When the spare time came, an even more miserable reality was placed before him. That was the outbreak of the Pacific War. The Sino-American Daily was sealed up, and he lost his job. Because of his personality, he did not go inland with his friends, but stayed in Shanghai, hiding in a small room and starting the work of concentrated translation that he had long longed for. At that time, I lived in the countryside and lost contact with my old teachers and friends. I thought he had gone west, but I had no news of him and had no way to find out!</p>
<p>Closely Translating, Beset by Poverty and Illness</p>
<p>The next few years were the most difficult years. Almost everyone suffered physically and mentally and had a sense of "the sun is setting and the road is ending, what world is this!" In the summer of 1944, I joined a group of single porters and went from my hometown to Shanghai to contact the old residence of World Book Company to compile a few books, hoping to earn some money to make a living. I still remembered Brother Shenghao and his Shakespeare's complete works, so I asked the host of the book company about him. Who knew that they were not far apart. Brother Shenghao had not gone west, but was living in seclusion in his hometown of Jiaxing, continuing to translate, and writing to make a living, similar to my situation! To be honest, it was just as pitiful! I was very excited and wrote a letter to Jiaxing immediately when I got home. A few days later, a reply came, on a green-lined manuscript paper, which did not seem to be my familiar handwriting. The letter said that after he got married, he returned to his hometown and translated behind closed doors. The cost of living was increasing day by day, and the royalties were not enough to make a living. He was also suffering from lung disease and was now recuperating... In this chaotic and barren year, what could a kind-hearted man beset by poverty and illness talk about except letting hard work and tuberculosis torment himself? This reply must have been written by his wife. We did not communicate again. At that time, I was also on the verge of starvation. In order to save my wife and children from starvation, I was exhausted physically and mentally and forgot everything. Only the host of the book company unintentionally told me that Shakespeare's complete works were about to be finished, and only a few books were left when Shenghao recovered his health.</p>
<p>Brother Entrusted His Younger Brother to Complete the Manuscript in His Will</p>
<p>Victory came, the sky was bright, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. I came to Shanghai again and met Mr. Zhan Wenhuhu. When I mentioned Brother Shenghao, he said sadly that Shenghao had died of illness in Jiaxing in the winter of 1944. He only learned about it from the book company after he arrived in Shanghai. This news shocked me for a long time. The book company said that his translated manuscripts had been successively typeset, but the last few books were not finished after all. He left a will instructing his younger brother Wenzhen to complete them on his behalf. Wenzhen was in the same grade as me in middle school and also studied Western literature. He must be able to do it. Two years have passed since the victory, and these three thick volumes of Shakespeare's complete works have finally been published by the book company (the fourth volume of historical plays is still being translated). This is good news for the cultural circle, which is on the verge of death, but when I think that this is the culmination of a faithful and diligent man's ten years of hard work, and that he himself did not see its publication, isn't it extremely sad? Poverty and illness seem to be destined for Chinese cultural workers. Now that I see the complete works, reminiscing about Brother Shenghao, and thinking about my situation at that time, I really don't know where my tears should come from!</p>
<p>Brother Shenghao's wife wrote these few sentences in front of the book: "When he was critically ill, he also said that if he had known that he would not recover from his illness, he would have risked his life to translate it..." He is not only a faithful cultural worker, but simply full of the spirit of a martyr.</p>
<h3>A Pictorial History of the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>— By Liu Sui</p>
<p>Edited by Cao Juren and Shu Zongqiao, published by the United Pictorial Publishing House</p>
<p>The editors state: "This is a record of war."</p>
<p>War, especially the Chinese people’s resistance against Japan in the past century, is all too familiar to every Chinese person. For two generations, we have struggled in the torrents of suffering caused by war, swallowing countless sorrowful memories and lessons. Although the times have brought history into a new era, these memories and lessons are still worth pondering over.</p>
<p>As the editors quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt at the beginning of the book: "Although what we are writing is a record of war, we hope that it will shine forth the brilliance of promoting human happiness and fostering world peace." We should give the highest evaluation to war records written on this motivation. Although the book from beginning to end records nothing but national hatred and the nation's blood and tears – cruelty and destruction – these are all ugly, despicable, and brutal aspects of human nature. On the other side of this humanity is filled with kindness, beauty, and a sense of harmony surpassing the ego. We do not need to be afraid of the desperate sorrow of humanity exposed in these bloody historical pages. On the contrary, we should search from these records earned with the nation’s cross, for the reasons why the invaders lost their humanity, to understand the trajectory of our suffering, and strive from here to seek a foundation of freedom and peace for ourselves, our descendants, and all of humanity.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, "Introduction," the editors toll the death knell for the invaders. Ignorantly worshiping warriors and greedily drooling over the continent, nearly six or seventy years of education since the 19th century have led them all to the course of invading China. The illustrations collected by the editors in this chapter are obviously not rich enough. Ignorant palace worship, crazy shrine rituals, feudal and obscene geisha dances, primitive and arduous lifestyles – these are all psychological foundations for the invaders to be brave in going to war. It is at least a regret to omit them before the record of the job contention. However, one picture is very good. That is the countryside at the foot of Mount Fuji, a countryside where even the ridges and foothills are reclaimed as morning fields, but interspersed with factory chimneys. Can you say that Tanaka’s "Development of the Continent" memorial was due to the mere warmongering psychology of the warlords when industry and agriculture have been existing so disharmoniously on this limited and barren land?</p>
<p>The second chapter, "Prelude to Japan's Aggression," is actually the prelude to this Second World War. The editors objectively pointed out the evolution of the international situation surrounding the "September 18th Incident." They quoted Hitler's statement that "The League of Nations is a reed on the water," saying: "At that time, China was climbing on this reed, hoping to be saved by it." It is both grief and revelation. Re-reading this chapter in the face of reality, we feel that Beethoven's saying, "To complain and beg for mercy to people in a storm is the most clumsy thing in the world," contains infinite desolation and tragedy.</p>
<p>From the third to the ninth chapter, it records a long and tragic journey from the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident until Japan's collapse and surrender. The editors divided the eight years of arduous war into seven periods: from July 7th to December 1937, the battles of Nanjing, Wuhu, and Hangzhou; from January to May 1938, the battles of Jinpu, Lunan, Longhai, and Jiangnan; the Battle of Wuhan in the second half of 1938 and the guerrilla warfare in the northern battlefield. It is generally correct to divide these three periods into the first stage of the War of Resistance. Then, the battles of Nanchang, Changsha, Guinan, and northern Guangdong after the retreat from Wuhan from November 1938 to April 1940, and the battles in Hubei Province, the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, until the outbreak of the Pacific War from May to December 1940, can actually be combined for the sake of the overall war situation. From January 1942, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, to the battles on the mainland battlefield and in the Burma region, until the various battles in the late stage of the War of Resistance in November 1944, it seems that it can be listed as the third stage of the War of Resistance separate from the above two periods. The various materials involved, such as international reactions, dynastic movements, and the situation of the enemy puppets, are rather brief, but the systematic description of the previous and subsequent battles is quite complete, and in several battles, the editors seemed to have experienced them personally, so there are some valuable anecdotes. The only shortcoming is that the area of the illustrations is larger, taking up too much space, and many admirable and tragic photos cannot be published. This book is named a pictorial history, but in fact, the text still occupies the main share.</p>
<p>The tenth chapter, "The Page of Victory," is the briefest part of the whole book, perhaps because it was printed earlier and there was not enough time to include a large amount of information. But we also hope that the record will end here, on the one hand, to let us permanently remember the hardship and solemnity of the great cause of the War of Resistance left by this album, and on the other hand, to allow us to vaguely smell a little of the lofty fragrance and warmth of the past in the boredom of reality.</p>
<p>Now someone has shouted the slogan "Face up to Japan after the war!" Can we be vigilant for our descendants and eliminate future aggressors from giving us a more tragic persecution? I would like to sincerely recommend this faithful "Record of the War of Resistance" to readers who have fully enjoyed the honor and comfort of victory.</p>
<h3>After Reading "Rainbow"</h3>
<p>— By Dong</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>"Rainbow" by the Polish female writer Wanda Wasilewska is a masterpiece that has caused a sensation in the literary world. It has been praised by literary readers and has also been made into a movie, receiving the support and love of a wide audience.</p>
<p>The original author is the daughter of a revolutionary in New Poland. Later, she herself became a strong revolutionary. Her works are full of solemn, dignified, simple, and generous descriptions. At the same time, they show everywhere the spirit of heroic, brave, resolute, and optimistic.</p>
<p>The success of her works has long been established in the literary world.</p>
<p>Her writing life started very early. She wrote lyrical poems in high school, but they were not very successful. It was not until later that she wrote a program script for a workers' entertainment party and achieved great results, which solidified her determination to start her literary work.</p>
<p>Her life experience is rich. In her childhood, she worked with farmers in the fields and deeply understood the miserable lives of the farmers. During her school days, she was at the height of the revolutionary movement in New Poland. She was practically impacted by this wave, which further strengthened her soul. In the Soviet-German War, she personally abandoned her pen and joined the army... In her life experience, she fully realized the true meaning of the people.</p>
<p>Therefore, her works vividly express the descriptions of those real lives and become a modern famous writer of realism.</p>
<p>Her first book, "The Face of the Days," profoundly reflects the side of Polish lower-class society groaning, struggling, and fighting on the line of hunger and cold. Later works such as "Motherland," "The Earth in Suffering," and "The Flames on the Pond" are all mirrors reflecting social life. The publication of "Rainbow" caused an even greater sensation in the entire literary world, harvesting a</p>
<p>"Rainbow" is the crystallization of the author's personal observation, experience, and thinking in the blood and fire of war.</p>
<p>In terms of artistic writing, it is vigorous, prominent, authentic, and touching. It grabs the reader tightly with dramatic descriptions from the beginning.</p>
<p>The gist of this novel (which was also made into a movie script by the author) – that is, the source of its story – was frankly told by the author to an interviewer.</p>
<p>"In a village near the town of Iwalov, someone told me the story of an ordinary peasant woman whose name was Alexandra Daeleman. When the Germans occupied her village, she fled to the guerrillas and fought the Germans with them. At first, she cooked and washed clothes for the guerrillas, and later she was sent out to work as a scout, and she often provided a lot of valuable information. No one in the army ever thought that she was a pregnant woman. In order not to prevent her from taking on the most important work, she tried her best to hide her pregnancy, but as the due date approached, she decided to return to the village. For three days in a row, she successfully avoided the enemy, but on the fourth day, she was caught by the enemy. In the freezing weather, this woman who was about to give birth was stripped naked and forced to walk on the street in the middle of the night by the Germans, calling her to point out the families of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>"In the morning, the German soldiers beat her severely and locked her in a shed. She gave birth to a son there. The Germans began to torture her again, threatening to kill her son. She stubbornly resisted all the time. Finally, the Germans got annoyed, killed her son, and threw herself into the ice river."</p>
<p>Then, the author reported the source of her story:</p>
<p>"This woman's story deeply touched my heart. I was truly shocked by the ethical strength of these Soviet women. During this war, I had more opportunities to see the examples of these women. In the movie script I wrote, this sacrificed heroine, Alexandra Daeleman, is a protagonist, here renamed Orina. When I describe these heroines, I do not rely on any imagination. Almost every character is portrayed from real life."</p>
<p>The author used such a story as an example, plus her personal experience, to describe the deeds of a heroic and moving heroine.</p>
<p>Through her skillful literary techniques, these deeds were vividly reflected.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The Chinese translation of this book is also very successful. The translator, Mr. Cao Jinghua, was very dedicated when translating, and his writing was fluent. The original author also sent him a special telegram:</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Cao Jinghua: I am paying attention to the great cultural work you are completing with admiration. I am very happy that even my works can contribute to the further consolidation of international literary ties. And to the Chinese friends and colleagues in the literary world, I extend my sincere respect! Faithfully yours, W. Wasilewska."</p>
<p>The value of the Chinese translation can be further proved by this.</p>
<p>Reading this work can increase our wartime knowledge, understand the wolfish hearts of the invaders, and learn the great patriotic enthusiasm of the resisters.</p>
<p>I hope that Chinese readers will all read this masterpiece (this book is written by Wanda Wasilewska, translated by Cao Jinghua, sold in major bookstores, priced at: 16,500 yuan)</p>
<h3>Rambling Thoughts in Solitary Berth</h3>
<p>— By Wang Cong</p>
<p>A story I heard:</p>
<p>One day, Hitler, accompanied by Air Minister Göring and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, was driving a car when they were about to cross a bridge. A donkey was blocking the way in the middle of the bridge. Hitler originally wanted to rush over. However, the donkey was quite large. If the car had an accident and overturned off the bridge, it wouldn't be fun. So the leader first ran to the donkey and gave an hour-long violent speech. However, the donkey remained unmoved and stayed there. Hitler returned to the car dejectedly.</p>
<p>"My Führer, watch me," Göring excitedly walked to the donkey and shouted loudly, "If you ghost don't leave, I will immediately send three thousand planes to bomb you to death!"</p>
<p>The donkey leisurely remained motionless.</p>
<p>Finally, Goebbels went with great confidence. He grabbed the donkey's ear and said two words softly, taking less than a minute. The donkey desperately fled away.</p>
<p>The Führer and Göring were both surprised and asked Goebbels what reason made him triumph?</p>
<p>Goebbels smiled naturally and said, "I just said one sentence, 'Please join the Nazi Party.'"</p>

<h3>"Half Cunning, Half Foolish in Nature"</h3>
<p>— By You Jin</p>
<p>In this day and age, it's really not easy to be a person. If you are too honest and straightforward, people will laugh at you as a fool; if you are too witty, people will scold you as cunning. Both foolishness and cunning are subject to criticism. So I thought of Huan Wen's wonderful words. "A New Account of Tales of the World" records that Huan Wen said to Gu Kaizhi: "There is half cunning and half foolishness in his nature." Lu Fangweng therefore has a line of poetry "People laugh that cunning and foolishness are both half." I don't believe there is really someone in the world who has half cunning and half foolishness. Who really has such a character split in half by a knife?</p>
<p>Cao Aman was the first cunning and quirky clever ghost in ancient times. In his childhood, he pretended to have a stroke, with a crooked mouth, to show his uncle who had repeatedly reprimanded him. The uncle reported to his father Cao Song, who was surprised and called Aman, but Aman was perfectly fine without any signs of illness. Song asked: "Uncle said you had a stroke, are you better now?" Aman said: "I didn't have a stroke, but I lost love from my uncle and suffered a curse." From then on, even if the uncle told Song about Aman's improper behavior, Song would not believe it. (See "Records of the Three Kingdoms, Biography of Wei.") This is the beginning of Aman's treachery, and this treachery is actually derived from the nature of cunning. This kind of "cunning," if developed, is great treachery, which is certainly not good.</p>
<p>But sometimes, in order to defend oneself and avoid disaster, cunning is indispensable. Also an event during the Three Kingdoms period: "Jia Xu was defeated at Yi, and met rebels on the road. Dozens of people traveling with him were all captured. Xu said, 'I am the nephew of Duke Duan. If you bury me separately, my family will surely redeem me generously.' At that time, Grand Commandant Duan Ying had long been a border general and his prestige shook the western land, so Xu used it to scare the Di. The Di people did not dare to speak, made an alliance and sent him away, and the rest all died. Xu was not Duan's nephew, but used power to save the situation. They are all of this kind." (See "Book of the Later Han.")</p>
<p>This is also a kind of cunning, but a cunning that does not harm righteousness, a forgivable cunning. Although it is lying, it is not a crime, because it is due to self-defense out of necessity. If cunning is permissible, we would rather take Jia Xu's cunning than Cao Aman's kind of cunning.</p>
<p>There are many examples of foolishness. The ancients called it foolish loyalty and foolish piety, and today people mostly praise beautiful straightforwardness and belittle intelligence. Unfortunately, few people can actually practice it. Being wise and protecting oneself, being hypocritical and evasive, still not daring to speak or scold about everything unreasonable, or even keeping one's mouth shut, following the old ways and compromising, thus preventing the society from having any signs of progress and clarity.</p>
<p>Seeing injustice on the road and drawing one's sword to help is a kind of bluntness, and also a kind of foolishness. Foolish bluntness is an indispensable character. If there are no foolish blunt people to do it, the world will be afraid of this injustice and continue to be dark and hopeless, and it will become worse. There are not many famous foolishly loyal people in history like Ji An of the Han Dynasty. Zhu Yun's "willing to be granted the Shangfang sword to chop off the head of a treacherous minister," and later "climbing and breaking the palace railing," can also be considered foolish enough. Although it did not save the decline of the Han surname, it is still considered loyalty, and it is still considered blunt, which is much stronger than the selfish and self-serving old men and hypocrites who only care about personal enjoyment.</p>
<p>If "half cunning, half foolish" can be established, I would rather people's "foolishness" be more than "cunning." In other words, it is better to lose to "foolishness" than to lose to "cunning."</p>
<h3>Caring for the Young and Supporting the Elderly</h3>
<p>— By Heizi</p>
<p>If one has a penchant for textual research, one can cite historical facts to say that respect for the elderly and honoring the worthy has always been an ancient custom. Recently, I heard that the local authorities of this city intend to formulate measures to respect the elderly and honor the worthy, and will form a committee to plan matters related to this. What is "elderly" and what is "worthy"? It is said that definitions have already been made. All citizens of this city who are over seventy years old and of good character are called the elderly. Those who are highly respected and over fifty years old, and whose works or careers are worthy of emulation and can be models for citizens, are called worthy. The former is a general survey, and the latter is recommended by representatives of the district residents. This is indeed a "virtuous" policy.</p>
<p>Respect for the elderly and honor for the worthy are naturally beyond doubt. This kind of movement that implies both praise and criticism in respecting the elderly and honoring the worthy may be hoped by those who plan it to benefit the world and people's hearts and improve social morality.</p>
<p>Originally, "It is rare to live to seventy in life," especially in this "crowded" and "chaotic" city. Being able to survive for seventy years in bacteria, filth, war, and poverty is indeed the most resilient life, worthy of both respect and admiration. As for the worthy who are highly respected and have careers worthy of emulation and can be models for citizens, they are probably close to social "celebrities" and have probably already been respected and admired. Similarly, the elderly who are healthy are generally in a good environment. Then, with many children and grandchildren, they are already both respected and filial.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is more meaningful to care for the young and support the elderly than to respect the elderly and honor the worthy. As the saying goes: Love my young and extend it to the young of others, and support my elderly and extend it to the elderly of others. Caring for the young and supporting the elderly is actually more practical with immeasurable merit than respecting the elderly and honoring the worthy. Especially in today's society, where there are many cases of the elderly dying in tidal flats and the young begging in the streets, caring for the young and supporting the elderly is urgent. Providing them with relief in terms of food and clothing is in any case more valuable than holding meetings, banquets, sending plaques and rewarding objects to the elderly and the worthy. As for the "elderly" and the "worthy," giving them honor in addition to honor, even if it is not considered meddling, may not be valued much. However, those who are cared for and supported will inevitably feel boundless gratitude and never forget it.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the authorities are planning to "respect the elderly and honor the worthy," we earnestly hope to draw their attention to it and first "care for the young and support the elderly," dear sirs!</p>
<h3>"Prenatal Education" — One of the Random Records of Nostalgia in a Chaotic World</h3>
<p>— By Ying</p>
<p>There are a few famous sayings: "The children of the poor wander the streets with messy hair and dirty faces, and the children of the rich turn around at home in demonic shapes, delicate voices, and delicate airs, all turning around in society in a dark and chaotic way, just like their parents, 'or even worse'." (See "Hot Wind.") If future generations are the same as or even "worse" than their predecessors, the world will naturally be even more unsightly, and people's hearts will become more inclined to "admire the ancient," so we should think of a way to reverse the decline, so that there will be more Auntie Qijin and fewer Miss Jiujin in society. The solution in the stationery store is: Everyone uses a brush, and "the national essence can survive"; the inventor of pills for the special treatment of spermatorrhea is: Everyone should swallow spermatorrhea pills, patients can be treated, and non-patients can be prevented, "the people will become stronger, and the country will have more hope"; in addition, scholars, professors, celebrities, and bureaucrats... have all opened many prescriptions, and they are all confident that it is absolutely necessary," but unfortunately, there are too many prescriptions, people's hearts are chaotic, and the children are still turning around in the country, even "worse" than before. The particularly large number of corpses of street children buried and cremated in Pushan Villa in March and April this year is clear proof.</p>
<p>"Nurturing you and raising you has benefited you." Children naturally belong to the nurturers as usual, with no room for protest. Because, towards the stronger, the cowards do not draw their swords against each other, but only towards the children, they are particularly brave, either glaring, roaring, or whipping, all without exception. Mr. Lu Xun said in his article "Children in Shanghai": "In China, middle-class families generally only have two methods of teaching children." These so-called "two methods" are: first, teaching children to be spiders in a web; second, teaching children to be small birds in a cage. Spiders dominate by building webs, and birds chirp sweetly, but outside the web and cage, they all become cowards like their nurturers.</p>
<p>Does this make us think more of the kindness of the ancients? Yes, but it is really not easy to be an ancient person. As a prince, even in the womb, his mother had to suffer the following hardships:</p>
<p>"When the queen was seven months pregnant, she went to the banquet room. The Grand Historian stood with a copper object on the left side of the door, and the Grand Steward held a dipper on the right side of the door. The Grand Diviner held a turtle shell under the hall, and all the officials guarded the inner part according to their duties. After three months of no enjoyment, if the queen sought sounds other than ritual music, the Grand Historian would cover the zither and say he was not familiar with it; if she sought flavors other than the correct flavor, the Grand Steward would rely on the dipper and dare not fry or season, and would say, 'I dare not use it to wait for the crown prince.' When the prince was born and cried, the Grand Historian blew the copper object and said, 'The sound is in a certain pitch,' and the Grand Steward said, 'The taste is above a certain pitch.' The Grand Diviner said, 'The life is in a certain state.' Then, a bow would be hung for the prince's body... " (From "Da Dai Li Ji Bao Zhuan Pian")</p>
<p>Under such prenatal education, the queen could only eat square meat, take square steps, and sleep square sleeps. If she was not careful, people would use the future crown prince to ask her to "take care of herself." I think the crown prince was unharmed after leaving the womb because of the queen's virtuous actions; otherwise, the queen would have had to suffer even more hardships. As for the prince himself, of course, it was even more miserable. Even the crying sound was not very natural. There are still the following sentences in "Bao Zhuan Pian":</p>
<p>"In ancient times, at the age of eight, they went out to the outer house to learn small skills and to practice small rituals! They tied their hair and went to university to learn great skills and to practice great rituals. When they lived, they treasured ritual literature, and when they walked, their jade pendants jingled, and when they got into the carriage, the sound of the luan bells was harmonious, so there was no way for deviant thoughts to enter... "</p>
<p>Deviant thoughts are actually "evil thoughts." Learning ritual literature and sounding jade pendants also means wanting him to be "kind." It would be better if he could become a piece of wooden furniture. Using "Why don't they eat meat porridge?" to answer the common people's loud cries of hunger is the prototype of ancient emperors.</p>
<p>Everyone feels that turning around is much worse than sitting still on the floor. The reason may be that prenatal education has not been promoted and rituals have been lost. So, if you want children to be quiet and look like something, there is a way to do it, just do it according to what is recorded in "The Book of Rites."</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— By Xu Shutuan</p>
<p>The Lack of Spittoons in America</p>
<p>People who come to America for the first time feel quite inconvenienced by the lack of spittoons. Therefore, they want to buy a spittoon in the market, but they cannot find it after exhausting their search. Americans simply don't know what a spittoon is. No wonder that in the era of Sun Yat-sen, an old diplomat suddenly had a thick phlegm rising when attending a grand banquet, and in a moment of urgency, he had to use a glass as a spittoon. Americans cough and spit phlegm in the same way, but they don't spit phlegm casually, but choose a place to spit it. When walking on the road, you can still see Americans spitting phlegm, even urinating, and even women urinating on the side of the road, but with female companions forming a screen of flesh to cover their shame.</p>
<p>The place they spit phlegm is the toilet and the sink, but I have never seen anyone spit phlegm into a handkerchief. This is the style of high-class Chinese. American women carry Kleenex (thin gauze paper) with them. Kleenex has a wide range of uses. It can be used as a handkerchief, a powder puff, toilet paper, and also to spit phlegm. Kleenex costs one dime per box, and the military camp store sells it for only seven cents, which is much cheaper than using cotton or a handkerchief. Because Kleenex is cheap, women use it to wipe their leather shoes and spit phlegm. Our China needs Kleenex very much. When you walk through North Sichuan Road or Nanjing Road Bund, the ground is full of phlegm, almost becoming a phlegm world, and there is nowhere to set foot. The Municipal Council should send out a large number of cleaners to carry out daily phlegm-sweeping operations. The root cause is still clearing heat and eliminating phlegm. If the atmosphere is heavy, phlegm disease is inevitable. (9)</p>
<p>Scientific Essays</p>
<h3>The Science of Dreams (4)</h3>
<p>— Gu Junzheng</p>
<p>What are children's dreams like?</p>
<p>Children's dreams are simple and genuine, not very symbolic, because children do not need to disguise their inner desires. But when they reach their teens, they gradually tend to examine their inner feelings, and their dreams become almost as symbolic as those of adults.</p>
<p>Children's dreams often involve seeing their parents, playing games, eating favorite foods, receiving gifts, or being chased by animals.</p>
<p>Do blind people see things in their dreams?</p>
<p>They absolutely can, unless they were born blind. People who are born blind primarily have dreams based on touch, with few visual dreams. However, there are a few cases where they can see things, but what they see are all things without concrete images, usually of a nightmare nature.</p>
<p>Can science probe into other people's dreams?</p>
<p>Yes, it can. Professor L.W. Max of New York University has studied the dreams of deaf-mutes. Deaf-mutes use sign language. When they dream, they move their fingers, sometimes expressing complete language, so a person who understands sign language standing by can really follow their dreamscape.</p>
<p>Can dreams predict the future?</p>
<p>Some authoritative scholars admit the existence of so-called "prophetic" dreams. However, there are many theories, the most popular explanation involving the phenomenon of so-called special senses. It is said that some people have a talent that allows them to read or know things without the use of the five senses.</p>
<p>However, most authoritative scholars take a skeptical attitude towards this so-called prophetic dream. The great psychologist Adler (AirxodAdler) studied many examples of seemingly prophetic dreams and found that dreamers are invariably in a state of anxiety, and he believes that this anxiety causes them to dream that the things they are worried about have already happened. Other skeptics believe that such dreams are largely coincidental; with thousands upon thousands of people dreaming of future events, it is only natural that some people's dreams will coincide with actual experiences.
