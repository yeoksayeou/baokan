<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕參政會駐委會，十四日上午九時例會，到左舜生·陳啟天·吳貽芳·傳斯年·羅衡等二十餘人，莫德惠主席·兪鴻鈞·王雲五·谷正倫·周詒春等列席，首由邵力子宣議外交書面報告後，即由周詒春報告最近農林。行政設施情形，據稱：棉花去年收成八百萬擔，預計今年應收一千二百萬擔。烟之用地，多在豫·皖·魯區，刻正在計劃中。絲經日人摧殘甚厲，現亦在設法予以改良。茶以台灣出產最多，今後在國內當注重祁門，屯溪等地產量。桐油去年出口共三萬七千噸，今年可達五萬能噸左右。其他羊毛糖等，均將設法改良，使之增加生產。繼由王雲五說明最近物價高漲原因，略稱：物價上漲主因，由於游資過多，滬為工商集中地，各地資本亦均集中，因時局不定，人多不敢投資於固定事業，於是資本變成游資，加以：（一）大票發行。（二）有限外匯，無限供給。（三）出口貨物採貼補辦法，商人搶購黃金美鈔，因此外貨高漲，國貨追踪而上，政府雖採拋售金糧政策，亦未生大效，本人主張：（一）採有效辦法使金鈔失去媒介作用。（二）嚴格管制物價，恢復戰時管制制度。（三）安定工商業。</p>
<p>王報告畢，即由兪鴻鈞報告黃金外匯高漲原因，平抑金價已為當最主要工作，政府決採金融管制通盤辦法，正擬具中。幷謂：目前問題，不在金融本身，而應求根本問題之解決。</p>
<p>繼由谷正倫報告，略謂：糧價高漲原因，由於物價上漲，要糧價不提高，必先抑平物價。</p>
<p>繼由參政員提出擀詢，傳斯年首謂：當前局勢之混亂，宋陸軍長應負其責，余建議政立即執行有效辦法，以挽救目前危機，否則余等即全體辦法參政員之職。後由羅衡，蘇珽，王普涵，薜明劍，伍純武，尹述賢，鄭揆一等先後提出質詢。關於外匯及黃金等處理問題，頗多責難，由王，兪一一作答。最後並決議通過由參政員組織財政同，經濟審查委會，定十五日上午九時舉行審查會，十七日上午九時舉行駐委會全體會。</p>
<h3>當前財政經濟政策　立法院作全盤檢討　今日人會將專題討論物價</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立院十四日晨舉行三一四次大會，各立委咸以沉痛心情，對當前金鈔及物價問題作全盤檢討，僉認我國現已面臨嚴重經濟關頭，整個財政經濟政策，實有澈底檢討必要，若干立委並主請宋院長蒞院報告施政方針，最後決定十五日晨繼續開會，對物價問題再作詳盡檢討。今日大會由孫院長主持，出席立委六十八人，修正通過四國家銀行法立法原則草案後，即變更議事日程，聽取九人委會報告。首由經濟委會委長樓桐蓀報告十一日聯席會議以過，繼由九人委會召集人李慶　，報告該會過去數月研討當前財政·經濟·金融等問題所獲結論，分：（一）物價。（二）黃金美鈔。（三）國營事業及非法濫支。（四）公債。（五）進出口貿易。（六）公敎·軍警人員待遇。（七）機構等七點詳加檢討，並說明因無法工作　咎辭職。王毓祥認目前經濟，金融情形已至此地步，民生益艱，而社會對立院期許又如此之重，會中應有嚴正表示，使漲風得以遏止。樓桐蓀指出，上海情形葉亂，一至於此其對國家所造成不良影響甚大，美報謂我已臨紊亂邊蓀，且為末日之關端，我人站於政務員立場，站於國民立場，對該報告書完全贊同，為鄭重起見，立院應專為物價問題開會一次，並應請宋陸軍長蒞院說明，俾對目前整個局勢坦白予以檢討。樓對若干立委所提黃金收歸國有政策案，表示贊成，認此案對紊亂之金融情形，可有良好影響，並舉出美國某政府官員之言，說明美方曾暗示我何以不動用目前凍結美國之三五六四〇萬美金，此款若能收歸國有，至少亦可發生一部份影響。簡貫三國出金鈔暴漲後，一般新薪水階級生活　時降低一半，我國現已面臨經濟上最後關頭實有請宋院長說明必要。新近由滬返京之孫九錫報告，其在滬目擊之金潮眞相，指出中央銀行拋售黃金，其價格有時轉較市場為高，顯有領導上漲嫌疑。彭醇士則指出，此次金潮與貸款有關，舉出農貸發放不久，糧價即形上漲。去秋工貸一發，物價即升，年底生產貸款一發，金鈔隨之狂澆，在在足以證明貸款助漲風。鐘天心，祁志厚，李晉芳等，對目前局勢，亦皆有嚴正批評，最後決定十五日最續開大會，再商金融物價問題，會議於一時許散。</p>
<p>中中交農四銀行法　立法原則草案修正</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕中·中·交·晨四國家銀行法立法原則草案，已於十四日晨立院三一四次大會修正通過，就中以中央銀行法立法原則草案討論最為詳盡，央行經濟研究所所長冀朝鼎及崔唯吾等三人，並列席大會，以備詢問。該案提出後，首由財委會委長陳長蘅報告再度審查經過，說明目前草案較過去簡化多多，理事會原定由廿一人組成，以人數過多，同時由職業團體推選亦多困難，決定減為十五人，其分配如左：（一）中央政府當然理事五人，（二）經濟，財政專家四人，（三）銀行業，農業，鑛工業，商業及勞工富有經騐者各一人，（四）央行總裁，合共十五人，其中三四兩項，係由政府聘請及遴聘。繼即由各立委討論，對於央行應否受財部監督一點，辯論殊熱烈，央行代表冀朝鼎等希望能將「受財部監督」改為受「政府監督」，其理由為央行若受財部監督，在組織系統上有隸屬財部之嫌，國家財政及金融政策所負使命不盡相同，似有各成系統必要。張肇元等主張以維持原案為宜，蓋各種銀行皆受財部監督，央行若自成系統，監督不易，且央行若與財部無監督關係，金融與財　政政策即有背道而馳之虞。後決議仍維持原議。另一爭論問題為央行是否有買賣生金銀之特權，若干立委鑒於目前金鈔狂漲，成認對央行此種特權應加限制，孫院長等以此事究為一時現象，不應於規定百年大計之法律中予發限制，亦照原議，最後對於央行總裁及行員應否銓敍，亦有熱烈辯論，全案經修正後，即予通過。中國銀行法立法原則草案等，並無多大討論，次第順利通過，其與過去不同之點，為董事人數減為十五人，董事長改為董事會主席。</p>

<h3>北平發生離奇暗殺案　美兵遭阻擊斃命　出事地點與沈崇案相同</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕昨晚故都發生一離奇之美兵被　案。晚間十時許，有三美兵赴大華電影院看電影，因該院停電　演，乃拆赴俱樂部，行經榮廠胡同時，挽　並行之三美兵，於聽到甚徵之響聲後，即有一兵向前仆倒於地，其餘二兵見狀大驚，趨前探視，渠知該兵士遭由後而來之槍擊，並已受傷，當即扶往美陸軍醫院，惟該受傷兵士係海軍陸軍隊一等兵，陸軍醫院不敢妄動手術，將其背上子彈取出，今日乃由海軍陸戰隊送往天津海軍醫院治療。美軍方今日未公布受傷美兵姓名，僅知其二同伴爲軍曹崔爾查克，一等兵　斯羅伯特。此案　生至爲離奇，出事後二小時，平警局得報告，現正查緝兇犯。（按：據合衆社北平電稱，該美兵係第五陸戰隊第二營伙夫，於被擊後廿分鎭即斃命，該案與沈崇事件發生於同一地區。又據合衆社電，美陸戰隊調查局於十三日下午一時召集會議，討論此案之調查事宜。）</p>
<h3>美方發表文告</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平十四日電〕美當局頃第一次發表關於陸戰隊士兵一名遭神秘槍擊　死之詳細文告，美當局並證實該士兵在北平城區一小街中遭槍擊，身中小口徑槍彈一枚，兇手在黑暗中逃逸無蹤。</p>
<p>美軍文告如次：「北平陸戰隊一等士兵，十三日晚自外返當時途中遭人人槍殺，官方相信死者係中小口徑之槍彈而致斃命，致死之確因現將由天津美軍總部加以騐屍後決定。</p>
<p>該士兵於十三日下午九時五十分送人陸軍病院，背部中彈，入院後五分　即告死亡。據當時與死者同行之軍曹崔爾　克一等兵　斯稱：至摩理遞街英國大使館時，彼等　見一類似爆炸之聲音，死者突然大呼：「吾中彈，吾背部中彈！」初，其同伴以爲死者　言而已，旋即見其口中流血，乃急召三輪車一輛扶之登軍，同往陸軍病院，但未經治療，即已斃命。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>辦理配給的要點</h3>
<p>配給制度，已因這一次的物價風潮，而漸形具體化了。經濟部正在統籌辦法，本市市政會議息，在一般消費大衆，尤其是薪工階級，自然非常興奮。按配給制度之所以推行，其主因有二：一爲物資缺乏，藉配給以謀分配的合理，一爲物價太高，藉配給以謀生活的安定。照目下情形看來，物價太高，已是無可掩飾的事實，而物資缺乏，雖不是普遍的現象，但是求過於供，來源不繼，至少有一部份也是事實。所以採取配給辦法，以爲緊急措置的手段，在理論上無可非議。</p>
<p>現在具體辦法，還沒有全盤決定，我們在實施上，願貢獻幾點意見。</p>
<p>（一）須先把握住物資　爲供應大衆也好，爲抑不物價也好，第一步，必須將配給的物資把握得住。尤其是爲抑平物價起見。非將全部物資把握得住，斷無成功的希望。所以着手之初，必須注重這一點。好得現在有許多日用物，如棉布，糖，油，煤，米這一類日用必需品，中央均設有專管或專營的機構，只須各主管機關誠意合作，願意把所有的物資，提供配給，以資表率，那麼，風聲所播，似乎也不難逐漸推廣。所成爲問題的，就是配給物品，必須平價發賣，與純粹營利事業不同。英，美，香港等處所辦配給，有許多配價，竟定在進價之下。就是說：政府甘願賠本，以維持大衆的生活，這種犧牲精神，我們有沒有準備，事前狠值得愼重考慮。</p>
<p>（二）須有縝密的規劃　無論是全盤的配給，或局部的配給，其受配的人數，均不在少，其所配的種類，數量，價格，日期，以及一切手續，旣要簡單，又要明確。這種辦法，斷非此令等因一類官樣文章所可比擬，亦斷非此令等因之類官樣文章所可奏效。抗戰時間，在陷區，在後方，此類失敗的敎訓，我們現在，多還能回憶。所以辦法的如何規定，機構的如何組織，以及經費的如何籌撥，必須一一先行規劃。固不可巧立名目，平添許多冗員，也不宜因陋就簡，致礙工作之進行。因爲這項工作，乃是一種業務，而且是一種極複雜的業務，不單是一種行政，所以需要科學的方法，與系統的配合。倘使意存省事，只圖簡便，籠統混括，敷衍了事，那麼，日後的效果如何，似乎不難逆暗。</p>
<p>（三）須具有鐵一般的紀律　所謂鐵一般的紀律，不單是指辦理人員而言，實兼指一般受配人而言。諸如虛報名額，一人兩記，恃強勒索，故意　軋等弊病，非得一般受配人眞誠合作，自我檢束，實不易絲絲入扣，做到弊絕風清的地步。但觀這幾日英國爲救濟煤荒，人人恪遵功令，自動停電的榜樣，就可知道他們政令之所以收效，確非偶然。我們現在辦理配給，一面固希望當局公正無私，　汰過去營私舞弊等惡習，一面却也要大衆確守紀律，勿予經濟人以上下其手的機會。</p>
<p>爲穩定物價，安定生活起見，逼到實施日用品的配給，這似乎已用到最後的手段。所以這種手段，我們只希望牠成功，再不能看牠失敗。因爲只許看牠成功，所以人事，經費，物資，辦法各方面，我們更希望他們愼重研討，萬勿掉以輕心。</p>

<h3>政府抑平物價　痛下最大決心　五機關組經濟監察團　緊急措施辦法限五天以內完成　務使物價恢復二月一日前標凖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次因金潮而掀起之物價普遍漲風，蔣主席殿堂關切，尤以金融波動，影響國家經濟至鉅，除於節晨特派軍令部第二龐團長鄉介民來滬澈查外，昨日復派專員覺帶手槍，責令本市淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾，即日組織經濟偵察綱及擬定抑平物價之緊急措施辦法。宣氏奉令後，業巳著手進行，並於昨日午後四時在該部招待本市各報社記者，發表重要談話如下：</p>
<p>蔣主席因鍳於此次本市金融物價畸形波動，顯係有人操縱，故特手諭本人即日組織經濟偵察綱，決以人爲力量，抑平人爲之漲風，此項偵察綱，由警備司令部、憲兵廿三團、警察局、軍統局及中統局五機構內選派當有能力經驗之人員共同組織，而由本人統一指揮，至抑平物價之緊急措施辦法則限五天內完成之。</p>
<p>宣氏繼謂偵察綱之組織，今晨（十四日）巳與各有關機關負責人設計決定成立一經濟監察團，負責決策指揮，並根據目前必需做及力所能及之三項目標，分設三組，　金鈔組，　糧食組，　紗布組，各組工作首先調查各項投機操縱或壟斷市塲之不法商人，至於緊急措施辦法，雖尚須與有關各方設計，惟原則業巳決定，心有故意抬價操縱或囤積居奇之不法商人，一經調查屬實，即予制裁，制裁辦法，如有法令根據者，依法嚴辦，哪超越法令，則依擬訂之緊急措施辦法或非常時期管制物價條例，軍法從事。並爲迅即展開實際工作起見，偵察綱業巳開始行動。</p>
<p>偵察綱之存在時期，將視事實需要而定，如確有永久存在之必要，則將另行成立一永久性之經濟偵察機構，該機構除秉承主席訓令由軍、憲、警、軍統等五單位派員主持外，並將延聘熟悉市塲情形及經濟專家爲顧問。</p>
<p>宣氏最後著重聲稱，此次抑平物價，政府巳具絕大決心，最低限度，必須恢復二月一日以前標凖。同時希望全市對囤積操縱之不法商人僅量檢舉，蓋目前因少數之自私自利而危害多數人之生存，不啻爲公衆之敵，政府爲保障多數人民利益計，決斷然處置，務使瘋狂之物價回復正常，並昐新聞界予以協助云。</p>
<h3>防止囤汽油　實行配給制</h3>

<h3>澈查金潮開始行動　吊查全部帳冊　摘錄買戶姓名　金價銳落後市無形停頓　今日續查金號銀欞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣主席爲澈查本市黃金風潮，於日前物派軍令部第二廳廳長鄭介民來滬後，昨日中午起，即注有警備司令部及警察局會同派遣之幹員，分赴平日專代中央銀行明配及抛售黃金之同豐餘，泰康潤，大豐恒三金號，及方九霞昌記，楊慶和兩銀樓，查詢平日交易情形，並吊取五家全部交易帳簿，摘錄其配售及抛售黃金之條數，承買客房姓名，交易同行之牌照，地址等，同時並分頭傳令五家負責人詹運生，應鳴和，倪祖光，張園柏，謝秉泉等，到警察局答詢，分別記錄在案。聞吊局之全部帳冊，尚待嚴密審核，俾便澈查此次黃金風潮中，是否有操縱金價，擾亂金融之行爲者。聞爲調查週密計。今日將發動第二次之澈查工作，澈查對象，將包括經營黃金交易之金號，證券字號，及小錢莊等。如查有不法行爲之實據者，決將予以最嚴厲之處置。聞澈查情形及內容真相，不日將公開發表。</p>
<p>查中央銀行平日出售黃金，分配售與抛售兩種方式。配售方面，金號同業係集中由同豐餘，泰康潤，大豐恒，方九霞等四家，向央行申請。銀樓業則集中由楊慶和和銀樓向央行申請。央行於每日上午十時，酌情開價配售。配售以後，央行再基本市面波動情形，委託各金號代爲抛售。自本月十日起，央行以奉當局命令，對金號之配售，暫予中止。據同應餘金號負責人語記者：該號於央行停配金號黃金後，即巳暫停交易云。</p>
<p>昨日黃金後市，以當局開始澈查各金號及銀樓，遂無形陷於停頓中。各金號相率停止交易。後市非正式喊價，竟破入六百萬元關內，見五百八十萬元之低價。各銀樓門市部，兌人多於兌出。襲南京路某大銀樓負責人語記者：統計一二日來，門市每日收入達九十兩，而兌出僅達六十餘兩，一反金價狂漲時之擠兌情形。銀樓業以收入既多於兌出，每日向央行之申請數量，亦大爲減少，昨日爲四十九條，前日亦僅四十五萬條云。</p>

<h3>勤工事件　聽取報告</h3>
<p>昨日會中並討論此次愛用國貨抑制美貨發生糾紛一案，特由社會局組織處處長王家樹報告澈查經過，大意爲：　據調查結果，三區百貨業工會舉行大集會而並未向市政當局登記，亦未通知治安機關，實屬不合法。　該工會理監事承認在九日前舉行會議數次，商討準備開會事宜，其向新都劇塲租借會址函內，稱係經濟問題演講會，經該劇塲查出開會用意而予拒絕，可見動機不純正，理應由該會理監事負責。　據調查結果，本案發生原因，不外，一、到會者擁擠，有一部份人不能入塲，二、開會內容與名義不符，引起羣衆不滿，而發生衝突。三區百貨業工會雖認爲有特殊份子指揮，但開會時該工會會特設佩有標記之糾察隊，佈置似頗週密，可見事先巳有準備。但此次事件既巳發生，政府及司法機關理當繼續澈查，嚴懲兇手，希望市參議會表示嚴正立塲。對於提倡國貨，亦請擬訂計劃，正式推動。</p>
<p>該會以提倡國貨參議會不便另組機構，應請市府核辦。對被騙工人請求主持公道，亦決議函請市府轉飭社會局辦理。</p>

<p>南市北區救火會主任李志良（本報攝）</p>

<p>滬南區救火會，創立於光緒三十三年，經費自始就由區內住民自動按月捐助。當時上海城廂內外共有三十餘家救火團體，因組織紛歧，救火時不能發揮最高的效率。後來經過各家負責人集議，將各團體合併起來，就成爲現在的滬南救火聯合會，下麵分爲東西南北中五區救火會，規定各區設置義勇隊員不僅要自備制服，並且負責爲本區募捐，警時須要立即出動，職員及隊員多是區內的住民，現在每月最高的薪水是十六萬元，最少的祇四萬元，但因工作關係，幾乎整天不能離開辦公室。從開辦到現在，一響有很好的成績表現。消防工具方面，在抗戰前五區共有幫浦車，云梯車，皮帶車及救護車三十餘輛，裝車太平龍頭一千多處，經過敵僞毀壞以後，五區現在共剩二十餘輛，太平龍頭祇剩三百餘處，大部份須待修理以後才能使用。北區現有幫浦車五輛，皮帶軍一輛，皮帶二十根，最近各隊員勤募二千餘萬元，新裝了一部族新的救護車，趙主任笑着說，「如是官辦的，恐怕半年也裝不成。」</p>
<p>不反對政府幫助　就怕不會造預算</p>
<p>談到他們的工作和火警時的出動情形，他說：該會規定本區火警，出動救火車二輛，其他各區各出動一輛，出動隊員的人數則視火警情形而定。他們並不反對政府的幫助，但就怕不會造預算。</p>
<p>他們希望成爲全國模範的民辦救火會，他們具有高度的服務精神。</p>

<h3>航輪互撞案初審　兩船長交仲秋放　旁聽席上聞諭起騷動　忻張供辭俱說船中旅客盡巳獲救　票務主任證稱至少二三十人沒頂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕芷江，華通兩輪互撞案，經地檢處偵查，認爲兩輪船長各有過失，一併提起公訴後，昨日地院初審，旁聽者滿座。據芷江船長忻成方供稱：本年一月十七日晚十時半在滬啓掟駛出吳淞口，於午夜十二時許即發生碰撞。最初發現擊通輪紅燈之時，兩船相距約五六百尺，當即拉汽笛二聲警告，但未得華通同聲，乃靠右行駛。同時我船上也備有紅綠燈，因華通所帶之二鐵駁上並無呈燈，遂發生碰撞。出事後經竭力搶救，全船旅客盡獲救出險。船未沉前，曾至各部視看巳無人。華通駛離後十分鐘，芷江輪始下沉，故船中巳無旅客。據華通輪船長張晉聲供稱：本輪係於十一月十八日零點二十五分時入吳淞口，在石埂港先拉汽笛一聲，四分鐘後，聞芷江江輪汽笛一聲。似其時兩輪距離巳甚近，不及回答，一分鐘後即出事。至鐵駁緊於本輪二旁並未違反航規。又稱：出事後栓視本輪無傷，即協力施救芷江輪旅客。由四十五號鐵駁救起五百餘人，華通輪救出百餘人，見昔江輪上巳無旅客，乃即駛離。但據證人周根稱：彼有弟兄三人，同趁芷江輪還鄉，出事時三人失散，彼遇救出險後，其兩史下落至今未明。並呈家中回信作證。又據芷江輪服務主任楊逸（當時亦爲落水者）稱：芷江共載有旅客近千人，即客票共售出九百餘張之多，碰撞時秩序大亂，當塲有數十人受傷，芷江輪下沉時，下層輪中據彼估計，至少尚有二三十人慘遭沒頂。繼而實行辯護律師要求准予交保。庭諭，被告忻成方，張晉聲，各責付其所屬之公益，通濟兩輪船公司，並另覓股實鋪保二家，准予保釋。諭畢，旁聽席中被難家屬大起騷動，甚有大聲呼喝者，因審訊巳畢，法警高呼「退庭」。二實行亦各隨律師出庭辦理交保手續。旁聽人乃遂漸退出。左圖（上）忻成方（下）張晉元（中國社）</p>

<h3>據報物資曾被盜賣　僞江海關舊案重翻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕憲兵二十三團曾得密告，謂民國三十三年本市僞江海關會將歷來沒收充公之軍火移交海務科，移交時軍火被盜竊者極多。及日軍投降約一周後，江海關倉庫中所存之大量火油，即被該科科長林某及高度股股長管某二人串通盜賣，用船運走數千箱之多，並謂此二事與海務科暫借海務巡工司英藉司長愛敷司有關。該案經憲兵二十三國移地檢處後，地檢處曾函江海關查詢，昨日江海關巳有覆函，略謂，此案曾經由港警局調查，偵悉三十三年九月十九日下午五時，與同月二十日上午九時，確曾發生軍火被盜事件，惟所失軍火極少，僅手槍六枝，子彈若干發、三十四年八月十七日，有日本人林二三郎，將火油一千箱自浦東他運，該批火油於九月二十一日，曾由管股股長交出八百九十八箱，餘百餘箱巳無法追回。至於愛敷司係江海關舊員，戰時奉召回英，三十四年一月回重慶繼續服務，三十四年八月勝利時，被派來滬辦理接收，前兩案在時間上似與愛敷司無關。</p>

<h3>臧案審結　法官爲假記者名義察訪　證人說話不符立遭申斥　家屬索償一億餘元　被告謂須千年償清　庭諭廿日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕臧大二子慘烈案這教唆殺人嫌疑犯西班牙水手賴令奈，昨日地院重審，並傳到證人趙阿弟，廖遠授（二人皆三輪車夫，後者曾至青島美軍事法庭作證），蔣德培，鄭勝初（二人皆羣都舞廳職工），及被害人家屬臧根實，臧海成等人到庭，與賴令奈對質。經兩邊法律辨論後，庭諭：「本案定二月廿日宣判，賴令奈還押」。</p>
<p>吳榮林推事昇庭後，即提賴令奈，訊問年籍後，諭稱：本案前次審理距今巳過法定期限，應更新審理，諭畢重由檢察官論告。旋即訊證人趙阿弟，據稱，去年九月二十二日，在華都門前候生意，直至打烊後始離去，賴令奈來時並未注意，惟臧大二子曾託彼留意，謂有一獨眼洋人（即賴令奈）乘車未給車錢。後賴出門時，臧即向之索取車錢，正爭持間，忽來一美沙皇干涉，並揮拳打倒臧大二子。據蔣德培稱：賴約八九時來華都，來時無伴，車錢付不付不知，但謂賴出門時確巳酒醉。</p>
<p>再傳鄭勝初，鄭係華都工役，吳推事曾以新聞記者名義至華都探訪，即遇鄭勝初，當時鄭未知吳推事「私行察訪」，故對當時賴令奈如何教唆，路特立克如何毆打臧大二子，言之歷歷。惟昨日庭上鄭忽否認目睹此事件之發生。以前曾告吳推事稱賴令奈與美沙皇係同時出華都，但昨亦加否認。當經庭上申斥。最後被害人之北臧海成代理姪女　　　，附帶民訴，要求賠償臧費八百七十萬零四百元，死者生産抵償費一億三千四百萬元，遺族撫恤費五百萬元，但被告賴令奈對庭上稱：彼每月　　，不過美金七十元，如此數目，需一千年　給始能償付，實無力負擔，且稱本人並未教唆殺人，自毋需賠償。</p>

<h3>寬放議價疏暢來源　米市塲情形好轉　白米門售最高不許過十三萬　試辦一星期再行議定新限價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米號業同業公會以産地米價高，如本市仍維持，便　　市塲交易最高價六萬九千元及門售最高價七萬六千元，則不僅無法運米來滬，全體米業，亦不能營業。而向社會無米可買，多告鷦。昨日上午乃推派代表萬墨林，瞿振華，楊久慈，楊潤禽，印福祥，徐崇仁等六人往謁吳市長，詳述成本高於議價之種種困難，潔請寬放議價，以使各米號恢復正常營業。吳市長經考慮後，當即口諭議價白粳十二萬，市塲交易加佣三千元，門市零售最高價十三萬，不准超出。依此辦法暫時維持一星期，臨看情形　於最近期內，還想能使之抑低。</p>
<p>昨日食米市況，形勢漸次好轉，久無昔訊之粳籼米，巳直至貨登記，計南市塲到白粳七九六石，薄稻一六八石，早稻九〇石，共一〇五四石，北市塲到白粳九〇四石，薄稻一九〇石，羊籼一七五石，杜籼九五石，白元七〇石，共一四三四石，南北二市　共有二千四百八十八石，各幫來滬漸增，人心見軟，售戶頗有吐脫之意，零售店納胃淡薄，趨勢續見鬆動，行情續疲五千到萬元泡影，惟交易稀廖，高白粳巳退入十三萬元內。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>市勢重轉生色，因劇烈下跌後，各方人心稍定，店鋪巳有逢低添　，且有着好之傳說，致疲憊氣氛完全消失，利朗最先有成交，價七萬六千元，較上回振三四千元，其餘各粉亦隨帶堅千元之譜，麩皮明疲暗堅，聞救總署有一萬五千担開出，投機商企圖廉價買進。故意在市喊低行情三四千元，若小包喊低至一萬八九千元，實際小包爲二萬四五千元，尚難購得，散裝麩約在三萬四五千元。小麥僅浦東淨貨七萬三千元有做開，市呈堅硬。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>連跌之後，一般貨主要爲價　似巳降至限度，猶岡掙扎，改售爲守，喊價又形回挺，店方趁巧有吸，零化尚佳，登高交易仍以生油爲中心，南勢逐步回撤，　生油首開二四萬元，午收爲二五萬元，吉桶生油最後喊價爲二八萬元，約較上日好起二萬元光景，豆油，成交既少，價格平衡，市亦帶堅，小車蔴油亦好起五千元，清蔴等油仍　行市。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>大都由疲傳堅，蓋賣戶巳不若前之急切，本街漸有問津，黃荳跌定之勢，市形回平，各貨略堅二千元左右，芝蔴市勢彷佛，生仁猛瀉之後，實銷有納，回起萬餘元，亦豆依然平疲，菉豆堅挺，苞米線削二三千元，紅糧平平，豆併早堅後疲，結果微升五百元，蠶豆平衡。</p>
<p>外股平疲</p>
<p>外肌昨晨堅午疲，形勢恍惚，晨初開出微昂，午刻最高，午後即在不利傳說中，多方紛售而急回，結果較前收計怡啤業廣紙業微升，鋼業尚漲半成，餘者平平及微挫不等。</p>
<h3>游資尋去路　統債又猛漲</h3>
<p>公債昨成交不多，僅有三百萬交易，報載立法院向財部質問之利買消息，人心向榮，統丙晨開二八〇〇元，買房潮湧，即漲到三八〇〇元高價結束，結果較前收計猛漲一〇五〇元，甲乙各升五〇〇元，丁升四〇〇元，戊種亦好四五〇元，收後續昂。</p>
<h3>毛紡及進出口業公會　請寬放羊毛輸入限額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市毛紡織及進出口兩業公會，昨爲羊毛原料進口事，特召開聞席會議，出席兩公會負責者多人。討論結果，決請輸管會寬放羊毛原料輸入限額。又對去年十一月十七日以前該業向國外之定貨，擬請速發輸入許可證。否則巳定之貨約，勢須被賣方取消，且影響及於下次定貨手續之進行。</p>
<p>又據毛紡織業公會某負責人語記者：統計本市各毛紡織廠每月所需原料，計毛條八十萬磅，羊毛普遍真理萬磅。而目前輸管傳揚可能配給之限額，則極爲有限。各廠以原料缺乏，現巳有三分之一儀式或減工。如一月中原料來路無望，則勢將全部被迫停工或減工，故不得不要求寬放進口限額。至將來進口之原料，原則上將按各廠之設備分配雲。</p>
<h3>錢兌業停止買賣　金鈔黑市漸渙散　金價較前收跌九十五萬元</h3>
<p>烚赤昨不脫盤旋，晨初開出七一〇萬至七三〇萬，好有逢高脫手者，而回跌至六六五萬，而後轉盤，十時後，央行以六七〇萬之價，配給四九條，此後始終不脫盤局，在六七〇萬至六九〇成之間掙扎，午刻仍無特變，午後即交尚屬平衡，二時後，錢兌業停止賣買，是以隔　交易亦無形體頓，在風聲緊急之下，黑黑市退至六二〇萬左右，結果較前收跌落九十五萬，飾金掛七十萬，銀元再退至五千元內，隨拆銀根微緊，息價在一角半至一角八間。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦稍見軟弱，美鈔暗盤晨開一三五〇〇元及四四四〇〇〇元間徘徊，爲狀十分呆滯，先後有榮做及查帳流言，錢兌業均停止賣買，缺乏正常做開，喊價稍低，結果較前收回跌三千元左右，港票亦跌三百元，港匯昨二七五〇元及三八〇〇元有成交，即匯三千四，英匯四五〇〇〇元，均屬有行無市。</p>
<h3>絲綢市況平靜</h3>
<p>絲綢趨勢，漸歸平靜，昨市一二〇號旭字有光人造絲竟日在六百三四十萬元之間盤旋，與上日價無甚軒輊，七五號金雞半光成交價一千零五十萬元，比上日稍堅，蔽經亦甚平淡，C字等級七百三十五萬元有交易，干經零担喊價照上日原盤，綢貨亦頗堅穩，昨市除美亞被面及大減格子璧縐略高外，其餘大致與隔日價相同，不過成交甚稀。</p>
<h3>紙張進口困難</h3>
<p>存貨可維持六個月</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據紙業公會某負責人稱：自輸管會交紙張列入第二類後，紙張進口甚感困難，目前到滬紙張，皆係十一月十七日以前之定貨，十一月十七日以後申請者，許可證皆未獲下故紙張價格　漲不巳，白報紙價格舊歷年前爲四萬六千元，目前巳高至十一二萬元約漲起兩三倍，其他各種紙張，亦略相彷彿，目前本市所用紙張，百分之九十爲外貨，國産紙雖價格較廉，但産量極少，不敷應用，以目前紙張存貨而言，約可維持六月之需用，如紙張進口辦法未能改善，則數月後，有發生紙荒之可能。</p>
<p>士林布續漲</p>
<p>昨日棉布市況，初承上日堅勢，嗣因紡建公司供售龍頭細布，申請者均得配購，致浮戶銀行脫售，做價二十磅龍頭國布十六萬七千，五福十六萬四千，比上日步降一千元，惟高檔一九〇士林布因染工未見減低，故售價續升一萬元至三萬元。</p>
<h3>紗市仍徘徊疲境　紡建掛牌高於市塲售價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市仍在疲境中徘徊，客幫仍少　　，今支紗續降　萬左右，紡建十一時掛牌開售，共有紗線十種，念支水月大包價開三百五直萬，然市塲上只做三百四十萬，又四十二支藍鳳，開七百卅五萬，亦開市高廿萬，故申請承購者極少，人心仍軟，並不因紡建掛高而稍振奮，趨勢似將入盤旋之局。</p>
<p>又訊，中國紡分建公司昨日售紗，共售五七六件。此中廠商佔四七三件，號家佔一〇三件。申請戶數共計二一七戶。此中廠商佔一七五戶，號家佔四二戶。</p>
<h3>棉織品複製業　請求提先配紗</h3>
<p>紗價激漲後，棉織品複製業各工廠屬凝頗受影響。複製品業公會曾　藥所屬各公會代表開會商討對策，結果決定呈請紡管會提先配售此次該會所收購登高各紗廠之棉紗，並改進配售辦法，該項呈文日內即將發出雲。</p>
<h3>呢羢春銷進展</h3>
<p>毛職品呢羢，春銷續有進展，本街與客幫絡繹需購，然其成交數額，巳較上前日爲減，推究原因，自關稅附加百分之五十後，一路躍漲猛烈，一也，受高利貸之痛苦不敢再行嚐試，二也，交易多欲現鈔，難以再打十天或半月支票，三也，一般買方，因此均審度實力而做，抱隨吐隨進，貴來貴賣，賤來賤賣之宗旨雲。</p>
<h3>台糖六次配售</h3>

<p>豬鬃市價，近日刺激，上海鬃每担由九十萬左右，漲至一百八十萬元。川鬃由一百十萬，漲至二百十二萬，約漲一倍，又目前工價，亦照生活指數調整，該業存觀望態度，鮮少成交，至國外市塲，因美政府抛售存貨，價格仍未轉好，川鬃每磅尚盤旋於二元五六角間，上海鬃僅二元一二角，有行無市，該業以目前價格陡漲，市塲混亂，均不敢出口，又資産，和源，賢豐，崇德等四公司，在補中出口辦法未實施前，中信局訂購豬鬃計四千一百担，內漢口鬃八担，其餘係川鬃，漢口鬃每磅四元五角，川鬃每磅三元二角。</p>
<h3>桐油再堅</h3>
<p>桐油　日上漲巳超越出口限額甚遠，據業中人云，桐油産地價格業報升騰，　市行商，爲維持成本，亦祇　得　時上漲，其他植物油最高者　爲柏油，每担巳漢至五十萬元，昨市桐油做開爲每担卅六七萬元，腳地甚堅，西洪隨足度奔騰，市貨奇缺，每桶爲卅四萬元，（又訊）另據某行商稱，滬市桐油市價係根據漢口之升降爲轉移，而漢口桐　油則多以香港市價爲進，故正規之輸出價格，每不能對整個市塲作全面之控制。</p>

<p>（魚價平衡）</p>
<p>此次百物騰漲聲中，魚價依然正常無暴漲現象。據魚市塲唐總經理談，日來魚貨到源暢通，隨到隨銷尤以漁輪貨採行拍賣方法，逐日開拍，能以正常合理價格成交，爲主要安定力量，照目前公應狀態，無論扳售或哄擡，在魚市塲均屬不易發生雲。</p>

<h3>中美間禁止翻版　繙譯仍不受拘束　朱部長昨向記者表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨往訪教育部長朱家　氏，提出許多問題，承朱部長逐一　答如下：（一）公費生問題，教育部已於前年規定，不以院系為單位，而視清寒為主。新生中百分之四十全公費，百分之四十半公費，其他百分之二十無。在此生活不安定局面之下，對已申請者，獲維持至畢業為止。至下半年新生是否再得申請，尚未決定，惟大體仍　維持。</p>
<p>課本問題</p>
<p>（二）國定本教科書問題：因前次審定至今，中間相隔時久，故內容已有不含之處，最近教育部正在開會商討，希各與論界多多貢獻意見，教育部當儘量採納。國定本教科書，本專由「七聯」承印，現印刷已告開放，大家可印。教育部對字畫紙張等定有標準，可將樣本自三月一日起，送部審定。經認為合格者，發給執照。印刷後，即可自七月一日起，發行推銷。（三）高中學生軍訓，本年或不致實施。兵役法規定國民皆需服役二年，則學生於受一年軍訓後，又需服役二年，智識份子時間寶貴，不應浪費，故現擬將軍訓與兵役制度打通，規定高中畢業後服兵役一年即可，以節省時間。</p>
<p>訓導制度</p>
<p>（三）專科以上訓導制度，已定各校組織訓導委員會，由校長為主，訓導長任秘書，其他各院院長，系主任，及能領導學生之教授，担任委員，使教訓打成一片。（五）中美商約簽訂後，禁止翻版，對於中國大學用書當然有影響，但繙譯仍不受拘束。（六）重慶學生兩次被打，教部甚為關切，惟至今尚未得詳細報告，已去函詢問，遇此等事件，凡擾亂社會秩序者，祗有依法律決。（七）報載北大大批學生休學問題，或不致有此事，本人至今未得任何有關此事之報告。（八）「解放區」流亡學生救濟問題，現由教育輔導委員會辦理。該會本屬青年團，後隸行政院，至今則屬教育部。</p>
<p>武大學潮</p>
<p>（九）武漢大學學潮問題，出於誤會，教部所發第二次復員經費，係作修建校舍之用，現今學校仍在上課，學生爭論之點，祗為要求减輕校方所定對第一次鬧事者之處分，但此項處分甚為和平寬大，故一定要辦，一部份學生或受人鼓動，故又作第二度鬧事，一經查出，亦將處分。教部已於日前派高等教育司長去漢觀察，周校長現在京短期內亦將返校。（十）憲法規定之教育經費百分之卅五，相信在憲法實施時，當可實行。（十一）黨團退出學校問題：黨大概已退出，惟此事非教育部所管。</p>

<h3>潘文珍昨招待新聞界　否認毆打教員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市立陝西北路國民小學被災教職員，於昨日下午三時，假大西洋菜館，招待本市新聞界，否認大火之後，有校長毆打教員事情。由該校事務主任張百能主席，報告陳素雲為該校代課教員。對於稱校長經清不公開一項，係含血噴人等語。</p>
<p>繼由該校校長潘文珍起立發言，對於陳素雲所稱各點，駁斥如下：（一）關於趁火打刦一層：學校有錢無錢，陳素雲根本無過問理由，同時燒掉不燒掉，亦與舞弊無關，本人至今未向教育局報告過，則何謂舞弊。（二）所云教育局撥下之救濟費二百萬元，本人僅打了一個領款圖章，一切分配辦法，全由校中同事自己處置。（三）校中教員吳寶琴所說的洗脚水不可得一點，亦不應由本人負責，學校因為經費極為拮据，故自動組織伙食團，規定僅上班時供給熱水。（四）陳素雲聲稱是我校長一點，本人亦須否認，當本人就讀浙江師時，陳　　只是我的教師，不是校長，而且以後本人曾担任該校校長之職，所以本人若尊敬她，承認她是我的先生，不然的話本人也可以說她是在我女師執教的。（五）關於濫用私人一節，更與事實不符，本人向來從公處理，不念私交，現任本校之教務主任　天民，確是本人之親兄弟，但她是畢業曁南大學，曾任教員七年的，試問是否有資格？况且陳素靈就是我私人，我因其能力薄弱，且隨時播弄是非，阻碍學校行政，故不念私情，請其另覓工作，即此一點，便可證明本人之不濫用私人。（六）說是校長應保障教員職業，則請問：是否阿狗阿貓都在保障之列？（七）李於打教員事，本人除開會訓話演講時態度較為嚴肅外，日常待人，向被譽為「和藹可親」，所謂邀親衆打教員者，不知從何說起？實為陳　　於出校後，不　廉恥，自行毀容，揚言被打，企圖嫁禍於人云云．</p>

<h3>「戲劇節」自勵</h3>
<p>— 洪深</p>
<p>一年一度的「戲劇節」又復屆臨，戲劇界同人決定了一　紀念的辦法，如同舉行紀念儀式，如同話劇平劇和幾種地方戲雜劇同時演出，這些只能够說是使這個節目不顯得過分冷落，距離我們想像當中如火似荼的「戲劇節」還差得太遠。</p>
<p>在抗戰當中話劇運動有空前的發展，訛都以爲一旦勝利到來，話劇的黃金時代就要跟著到來，這個夢想終於給殘酷的現實粉碎了！在全國烽火遍野生命塗炭的當兒，話劇由萎縮而極度衰歇。假使要劃一根弧綫來表示，應該是這樣子的，即抗戰開始，弧綫漸漸上升，武漢會戰—第二期抗戰的開頭，應該是「升弧」的頂點，以後雖漸漸下降，但其勢甚緩，到了勝利來臨，「降弧」變得非常顯著，去年劇增不景氣的情形，好像已經到了「降弧」之底。</p>
<p>我們要有勇氣面對下列必將到來的困難：（一）由於通貨繼續惡性膨脹，人民大衆的購買力還要削弱，尤其是話劇觀衆，却是些小公務員，學生和知識份子，他們將更加貧困化，這意味着營業演出上座的更加不可靠；（二）兩個　本塲子尙待奮鬥後取得；（三）好萊塢的影片將以更尖說的方式侵入，並擴大其佔領；（四）演出費用的籌維將更加艱困，並影響演出的水準；（五）話劇演員的生活會更加拮据、（六）由於發表與上演的困難，劇本創作產量無法提高，這就是說劇本荒還是得不到解決，可能更嚴重……</p>
<p>當然這些困難不是每一個孤立地存在着的，而是互相關聯着的，相加相乘的，觀衆購買力薄弱，上座不好，前台就不肯繼續訂的；好萊塢的電影更猖獗，使得在高利貸下喘不過氣來的話劇，增加他的經濟的困雖，演出乃不能不因陋就　，更不能不在演員待遇上打算盤，於是乎劇作家不能不擱等。</p>
<p>這似是最于悲觀的看法，但也是必將到來的事實，我們必需有面對這些困難的勇氣，才能够克服它，我更相信這些困難將不僅是話劇所獨有，而且是平劇地方劇所共有的。</p>
<p>今天我們來紀念戲劇節，一面要站在戲劇界本身的立塲爭取戲劇連動約有在與發展，更重要的還要領導人民爭取和平，發揚話劇運動三十年來的光榮的傳統！</p>
<h3>戲劇節感言</h3>
<p>— 魯思</p>
<p>過去一年的劇連，是不是搞得眞像某些人們所說的那麼「沒有意義」呢？這自然是另外一個問題。所以，在這戲劇節的一天，我要特別把它提出來，籲請每一個從事劇運的人嚴格地作一番自我批判的；要知道，追思旣往，爲的是策動未來，清算一下舊賬，利用過去的失敗來誘導出今後的成功，也並不是全無意義的事。</p>
<p>據我個人的看法，過去一年的劇遠低落，固然受了社會的不景氣的影響是很大的，可是，劇運本身的缺乏着一個明晰的目標，或者說戲劇還欠缺着那麼一個中心點，也是個大原因吧。各劇團所有的上演劇目，多半是把它作爲「戲劇商業化」的一塊塊敲門磚的，他們在試着戲劇的命運，看看那一類的戲最容易賣座。這不能不　是劇運的一個致命傷</p>
<p>我們根據了過去的失敗經騐，想要挽救今年的劇運，首先便得確定它的路綫，使得我們今後的戲劇有個中心點。</p>
<p>那麼，我們需要的戲劇之中心點是什麼呢？一句話說：「爭取建國與和平」！</p>
<p>戰時，我們曾使我們的戲劇服務於抗戰；今日，我們必須指導我們的戲劇服務於建國。現在，內戰日深，全國的經濟開始在總崩潰了，老百姓們都處在死亡綫上，我們非使每一個老百姓了解建國的意義，羣相挺身而起，以其一切努力於和平，以及爭取統一，已經不足以突破目前這一最大的危機的了！而對老百姓作宣傳和敎育，其最有效的武器，誰都知道是戲劇；因此，我們必須燃燒起我們的熱情，堅强起我們的戰鬥力，務使戲劇運動與達國連動緊緊地聯緊起來，號召全國的人民一致起來，努力以赴！</p>
<p>坐待客觀條件的改善，而再從事劇運，那是守株待兎之類，並且也是最最不懂得劇運的！</p>

<h3>雨果</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>法國浪漫主義小說家雨果（Vicior　Marie　Hugo1802-1885），生活一向是很隨便的。他年靑的時候，有一次和愛人福契姑娘（AdeleFaucher）在談情時，福契姑娘答應了給他十二個熱吻。後來，在他寫給她的一封信裏，他居然寫着：「親愛的！請恕我吧，並且請准許我在妳允許了我的十二個熱吻中讓我現在光索取一個！」</p>

<p>正如一個流落他鄉的人，怕碰到他的生日一樣，我是怕我們這個節日的。因爲到了這一個「幸福」的日子，流落的人對於他的家不能忘却；幹戲的人對於自己的悽痛的行業不能忘却——不能忘却，就是絕大的痛苦。</p>
<p>推出最多的歡笑來慶祝，然而心底確是悽然欲泣。</p>
<p>從「新戲子」到「不正常行爲」，從「唱話劇的」到「藝員登記」，從「社會裝飾品」到「沒有忠孝節義」……藝術本身同工作者本身，在這荒唐的國度裏，一直還被扔在一個很荒唐的地位。抗戰，勝利，戲劇同劇人盡了力。</p>
<p>抗戰，勝利，同時侮蔑戲劇的人也盡了力。</p>
<p>不能忘却！</p>
<p>從蓬勃到凋落，從火熱到冷却，從集體到自私，從眞　到虛僞，從沉醉藝術到崇拜黃金，從「社會價値」到「票房價値」，從爲戲劇而活着到爲活着面演戲……歷史的考騐是可怕的；歷史的考騐底結果，更是可怕的，生活的鐵鞭，掃得人失去了重心，像一隻隻的陀螺，急促地，胡亂地轉着轉蓋而倒了下去。</p>
<p>「人要活下去」，「存在就是力量」！</p>
<p>在堂　響亮的口號下，於是卑俗成爲了高尙，彎曲成爲了正直，陰　成爲了光亮；非成爲了是。</p>
<p>該怎壓　活？用什麼方法來存在？</p>
<p>誰提出這樣的問題，誰就是白痴；訛固執着「怎麼樣」與「什麼」，誰就是精神病患者。</p>
<p>不能忘却！</p>
<p>舞台上，眼看着要降生一種嶄新的戲劇格體，它不是悲劇，不是喜劇，旣不是鬧劇，更不是悲喜劇，它應該呌「玩劇」。演起來好「玩」，看起來更好「玩」的一種「玩劇」。</p>
<p>舞台上，眼看着要降生一種嶄新的表演體系，它不是海派，不是京派，旣不是自然主義，更不是心理寫實主義，它應該呌「非人表演體系」，用盡方法讓觀衆看起來絲毫沒有「人」的感覺的體系。</p>
<p>舞台……</p>
<p>然面「存在就是力量」，然而「是含淚的微笑」，然而是：</p>
<p>訛能忘却；是最大的幸福。</p>
<p>在這「幸福」的節日，我有着最淸楚的記憶。</p>
<h3>檢討</h3>
<p>— 陳白塵</p>
<p>為第四屆戲節作</p>
<p>在此時此地來紀念戲劇節，其主要意義，恐怕還不是展覽自己。　抗戰十年來的成績自然是有的，但好漢不提當年勇，處在劇運低潮的今天，自不必陶醉於過去，然而慘些些的哭訴當前困苦，就更加不必。劇運之路從來就是硬紥硬打，自己硬擒出來的。當年南國社演戲給塲子裏一個唯一的觀衆——　子看，都沒有叫過苦，今天上海尙有兩家劇塲，還不滿足？只要你是向前走，向着陽關大道走，別怕自己會失敗。所以在今天，檢討自己許是更重要。</p>
<p>我是個寫劇本的，我只能談本行。我想檢討目己。</p>
<p>其實檢討自己，不一定在今天，所以一兩月以前我就檢討過一回。那是洪深先生編大公報的「戲劇與電影」，要我寫文章，我就寫了一篇，呌「一個問題」文章的內容是：我覺得目前的這種戲劇形式太束縛作家了，尤其是太束縛觀衆。觀衆看戲是有傳統的看法的，我們目前這種話劇的形式，並沒有眞正爲廣大羣衆所接受，我們應該找尋更適合的形式。在今天，我又檢討一回，我覺得我很固執，還要堅持成見：目前這種話劇形式，是「一個問題」了。</p>
<p>使得我這末固執的，是幾位前輩光生和一位自認外行的先生的意見。他們都說：「內容決定形式」。說我想錯了；你的內容爲大衆所接受了，你的形式自然會被接受呀！</p>
<p>什麼樣內容的戲，便會有它自己的表現形式。這是當然的。可是天，我所說的「形式」那裏是這回事呢？易卜生寫「羣鬼」是挪威的生活內容，曹禺寫「言兩」是中國的生活內容，難道說「羣鬼」是挪威形式，「雷雨」便是中國影式了麼？「羣鬼」與「窗兩」的形式又有什麼分別呢？</p>
<p>我明明是說，現在需要一種民族的形式了，人家却跟我去講內容了—中國的麵粉做成麵包，你跟農民說這呌大餅，他還是搖頭的。</p>
<p>因爲我把這話劇形式不被廣大羣衆接受認爲是今天話劇衰落原因之一，更惹得一位自稱外行的光生足足地對我冷嘲熱諷了一番。認爲抗戰期問劇述如何如何蓬勃，今日的低潮完全是政治的原因。意思說我是這重就輕。我倒沒有否認政治原因，但是如果一切推給客觀的環境，而主觀上袖手旁觀，我却以爲是不大對的。如果政治上了軌道，我們的話劇形式是不是就會被廣大羣衆——尤其是農民完全接受了呢？——其實這已經是無需假設的了，我們只聽說農民歡迎秧歌舞，而對於話劇不見感到興趣，不已經够說明了麼？</p>
<p>戲劇不能走開觀衆，誰都知道。但說到觀衆而會忽略了廣大農民，該是要不得的。我很固執，我覺得以今日的話劇這形式舉獻於中國的農民終究是「一個問題」。</p>
<p>因襲的包袱是很難丟下來的。我也知道民族形式不是誰可以一筆畫就的。檢討自己，不過是爲了策勵自己而已。這篇短文當然並不是什麼答辯之類，理合附帶聲明。</p>
<h3>戲劇節瑣感</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>過去寫戲是票玩，近來又久未寫戲，按說，是沒資格在今天這個値得紀念的戲劇節亂發議論，但承編輯先生催索小文，盛情難却，且旣會與戲劇有綠，就不妨「附庸風雅」一下，所云當吾，還望戲劇同人不以圈外人語見罪。</p>
<p>與戲劇結緣已十年，對戲劇界情形也算略知一二，有令人滿意的地方，可也有令人遺憾的地方，茲乘戲劇節機會，謹就想到的提供兩點應請戲劇界特別注意的淺見，希望能予考慮的餘地。</p>
<p>（一）關於劇木，無論任何一種戲劇的演出，其選擇劇本的範圍都很窄狹，不外一者拘於門戶之見，一者限屬於該職業劇團的職業劇作者之作。而這些劇作者便不能不爲演出而寫，甚而說是為賺錢而寫，（所謂適合生意經）其創作態度自不可能嚴　，認眞，其文藝格調也便可想而知。這種現象近年來此比皆是，固然這也是整個經濟高壓下的一個不得已的過渡時期，但我想這不是絕對不能够克服的問題。政府之苛加　稅也是促成的原因之一。假定中國劇藝還需要有所進步，和世界劇藝競競上下的話，這是値得注意的。</p>
<p>（二）關於劇人，表面上不可否認的劇人已有密切感情與事業上的聯繋和合作，但骨子裏也許仍有相當的距離。這對劇運有着嚴重的影響。這是說活着的劇人對活着的劇人之應有的態度。還有就是活着的劇人對死去的劇人之應有的紀念與撫恤。因爲今日之劇藝能有這點基礎，那些死去的劇人都有其尊定的功勞，像朱雙雲，左明，沈碩甫，賀孟斧，施超以及最近廢機的李世芳等等，他們為抗戰犧牲，也可以說是爲劇藝犧牲，死後不該僅是一點表面虛榮的追悼，對其身後家屬似乎尤有同情協助的必要。這不但給死者靈可以安慰，也是給生者精神以勉勵。然而這些在今日竟被劇界同人疎忽了，因此我常爲那些「人死人情死」的劇友們，感到寒心！希望戲劇界能切實注意這個問題，設法有所具體的表現。</p>
<p>以上了草陳詞，有感而作，如有謬誤之處，願受指責。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>金錢非萬能　汽車也飢餓</h3>
<p>— 方文</p>
<p>這幾天整個上海在漲風的巨浪之中動盪着，黃金如脫韁之馬，白米如不繫之舟，百物都在在跑亂跳，勇往直前，單就白米一項而言，幾天之中，由七萬有零，一躍爲十四萬，而且有市無貨，欲購升米斗粟，也要託人情賣面子，東奔西走，煞費周章，「民以食爲天，」升斗之民，除了收緊褲帶以外，復何言哉？</p>
<p>事又凑巧，在道米慌聲中，同時上海的汽車，也鬧着議荒，連日各加油站上，停着數十輛　腸轆轆的汽車，排着一字長蛇之陣，嗷嗷待哺，鵠候上一二小時，還不得一飽，正像淪陷時期，一班市民候領配給食糧，同機可憐！</p>
<p>金錢萬能！科學萬能！上海的縉紳腹賈，平日靠了金錢和科學的巨靈之堂，有恃無恐，萬想不到巨靈之掌，一遇　荒，一樣也會不靈了！所以適次汽車鬧了一回饑荒，似乎多少也可給上海的縉紳腹賈一些啓示！</p>
<h3>「帮帮忙」</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>連日金紗狂漲，影響物價飛騰，吳市長以民生堪慮，特於十二日下午四時，召集有關日用必需品之各業公會，飾時舉行緊急會議，商討過制漲風辦法，在會議席上連稱：「大家帮帮忙，否則的話，一定要我來辦幾個，似乎就太沒趣了！」（見十三日本報）</p>
<p>這幾句話，市長說得多麼的「客氣」，更多麼的「風趣」，抑制物價，要各業領袖「帮帮忙」，這正是表現着執政者的「苦心」！但這也是一種「沉痛的哀號」！然而市長又說：「一定要我來辦幾個，似乎就太沒趣了」！這二句話，眞像上海白相人所謂「識想點」！</p>
<p>但是我們從過去的好幾件「案子」看來，有「背景」，有「靠山」，多能够照樣的「搖搖擺擺。」奈何他不得！</p>
<p>在這席會議的最後，市長並希望「大家不要滿腦子都是金子」。這一句話眞「切中時弊」！上至達貴，下至走卒，那一個不在做「黃金夢」？</p>
<p>帮帮忙的呼籲能否生效，還看你眞的能不能辦幾個？</p>
<h3>杜魯門私生活</h3>
<p>— 郁强</p>
<p>杜魯門不睡在林肯的床上——白宮的賓貴的古董。他相信它也許會被認爲　越。他有他自己的床，每天早晨當華盛頓還在鼾中時，他離開了它，精神飽滿。</p>
<p>他有四輛白宮的汽車，常用的是一輛派克牌的黑色大車，他呌它爲「瑪麗皇后」。他是一個無耐心的旅行者，所以不願坐火車而乘他的四引擎的G54型的飛機「神牛」號。他相信飛機能够在任何的氣候中飛行，所以去年的聖誕節，他不顧風雪交加，乘機回米蘇里去過節。</p>
<p>他有時也乘總統遊艇「威廉姆斯堡號」泛舟波托瑪克河，做短程的旅行。這種旅行也算不得逍遙，他帶了一部份工作到船上去做，不過是能够逃避煩噪的電話聲。離白宮大門八十哩，瑪麗蘭州內卡吐克星山中有一座爲羅斯福而築的鄉村風味的孤立的營帳，名呌「香格里拉」（Shangri-la）。</p>
<p>杜魯門夫婦居住中的白富，比柯立芝總統時代還要寗靜。杜魯門極少寔請一個顯貴之家，也沒有社交活動。當他的餐桌上有客人的時候，他們大多是從米蘇里來拜訪他的親戚。</p>
<p>杜魯門的大的玻璃而的桃花心水的寫字　與羅斯福的裝飾混雜的寫字　比起來，眞可說是整潔的模範了。杜魯門的寫字　旁的椅子是新近設計由金屬和藍色的皮革造成的。</p>
<p>在他的寫字檯上有一架電話，一隻熱水瓶，一面小的絲質的美國旗，一隻小的木刻的驢子，一隻小電鐘。他的紙張整齊的堆成一疊，壓在吸皇器下而。</p>
<p>寫字　的後面，有一張桌子，上面放着一些他的家庭的照相，再後面就是一扇大窗，望出去就看到飄揚的美國旗和總統旗。</p>
<p>羅斯福的集郵的範本和鉗子從杜魯門的辦公室中消失了，代替它們的是新主人所收集的早期的飛機的畫像。房間內還有一個裝着「米蘇里」號戰艦的模型的大的玻璃盒子和幾張這艘戰艦的照片，再有幾張載他去開波茨坦會議的「奧格斯塔」號戰艦的照片及三隻大的金屬的飛機模型。</p>

<p>我看他將來畢業出來，決不會出色的</p>
<p>看發票</p>
<p>譬如你買一瓶三星白蘭地，（這瓶酒好不好是另一問題）付了錢，拿回一張發票，早晚市價不同，除開這張發票之外，就頗難說出它的價格</p>
<p>文憑也如同是一張發票，開明你付出多少靑春與金錢，（肚子裏裝着的是否是上好白蘭地是另一個問題）。怎麽樣？你以爲入學取文憑不是一塲買賣嗎？</p>
<p>馬拉松</p>
<p>好比一個出奇的運動會：一千五百米賽終點橫着一條綫，選手們跑得精疲力竭，好容易快要碰到它了，忽然移開，移到一萬米。於是選手們只得拚命再往前衝，還沒衝究一半，忽然宣佈這次比賽是馬拉松。</p>
<p>這就是現在的物價，我們這些選手只有當塲昏倒完結。</p>
<p>變質量</p>
<p>物價飛漲，支出激增。但有一個好辦法，維持原來的支出額。</p>
<p>譬如米價五萬時，你支出五萬元，吃一擔米，十萬時你可以買五斗；廿萬時你可以買二斗半來吃。而你永遠維特五萬的支出額。或者，你原來吃的是白粳，米價一路飛漲時可以一路改吃次白粳，好糙米，次糙米——以至於幾或麩皮。支出永遠維持原數。</p>
<p>可是社會局很帮忙，生活指數總是每月增加，雖然不見得太多。如果你是按指數支新的，而又生活如上法，就大爲便宜了。豈不收人激增了？</p>

<h3>The Recovery of Chengwu and Approach to Linyi Expected Soon; National Army Forces in Eastern Henan Meet in Minquan; Communist Zhang Taisheng's Troops Completely Defeated</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Reliable sources confirm that the National Army has made progress in southern Shandong and along the Longhai Railway. Northwest of the National Army County in southwest Shandong, north of the Longhai Railway, Chengwu was recovered on the 13th. The National Army advancing towards Linyi had captured Zhuchen, eight kilometers southwest of Linyi, on the 14th. Linyi is already within reach, and it is expected that the National Army will enter Linyi city today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 14th] The National Army forces in southern Shandong recovered Chengwu on the 13th, blocking Liu Bocheng's escape route eastward. Liu Bocheng himself and his First Column are now in the area between Liuhe and Caoxian. Their only escape route may be to flee from Dingtao to the Dancheng area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 14th] The National Army advancing towards Linyi reached Zhuchen on the morning of the 14th, less than ten kilometers from the outskirts of Linyi. It is expected that they will arrive in the afternoon. Most of the Communist troops in the city have begun to move north, seemingly abandoning Linyi. The National Army advancing from Xintai towards Mengyin reached Wuyang Town (ten kilometers southeast of Xintai) on the 13th and is continuing to advance.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Army forces in southern Shandong entered a fort five kilometers south of Linyi at 3:00 PM on the 14th. It is generally predicted here that Linyi can be captured by noon on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the National Army broke through Chen Yi's outer defenses of Linyi, they launched a pincer attack on both banks of the Yi River. By the afternoon of the 14th, they reached the line of Shilipu Fort and Zhujiamiao (nine li from the city) in the southern suburbs of Linyi. The vanguards of the forward units are actively conducting tactical reconnaissance under the walls of Linyi, but are strictly obeying orders and have not entered the city.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 14th] The National Army forces that recovered Hao County belong to Zhang Guangzhang's 48th Division. The Communist troops fled northwest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 14th] The Xuzhou and Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters troops in the western section of the Longhai Railway met in Minquan on the morning of the 14th. There is no trace of Communist troops on the railway line. The roadbed, bridges, and telephone lines destroyed by the Communists between Minquan and Yejiguan on the small branch lines have been fully repaired by noon on the 14th and are continuing to be extended eastward.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Liu Bocheng led remnants of the First, Second, Third, Sixth, and Seventh Columns, continuing to collapse from the northwest of Caoxian towards Juye, Dingtao, and Heze on the 14th. The National Army is pursuing closely across Caoxian.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Baoding and Xushui; Communist Troops Launch Fierce Attacks on Strongholds Such as Caohe; Yujiazhuang and Fangshunqiao Stations Recaptured</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The National Army forces in the Baoding area have made considerable progress in recent days. Yujiazhuang and Fangshunqiao, two military stations south of Baoding, were recaptured by the National Army after several tug-of-war battles. The National Army approaching Mancheng has now closed in on the city walls from the east, south, and north. The National Army moving south from Yixian has also joined forces with the troops attacking Mancheng, and the county seat is expected to be recovered soon. The Communist troops, totaling over 10,000, are losing their ability to resist under the National Army's control. However, the situation north of Baoding has suddenly become tense, with the Communist troops attempting to capture Caohe and Xushui in order to contain the National Army's attempt to take Mancheng.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 14th] The fighting between Xushui and Baoding intensified on the 14th. It is reported that the Xushui and Caohe stations have fallen. National Army forces are rushing to their aid from the north and south. The sound of artillery fire can be heard in Baoding.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The Communist troops have launched another offensive north of Baoding. The battle for Xushui has been fierce since last night. Caohe Station and other strongholds between Xushui and Baoding are simultaneously under fierce attack by over 10,000 Communist troops. Passenger trains between Beiping and Baoding were attacked. A fierce battle is raging in Suicheng Town south of Xushui. Song Kentang, Chief of Staff of the Eleventh War Zone, and Fu Zong Commander of the 34th Army Group are both directing operations at the front. Telephone communication between Beiping and Baoding has been cut off since yesterday. Armored units in Baoding have been deployed to assist in the fighting. Battles are raging south of Caohe and at the Xushui River bridge, and the flames of war are spreading.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding Dispatch, 14th] The National Army advancing southwest from Yixian has successively recovered strongholds such as Yaocun and Wuluocun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The National Army in Yixian continues to mop up southward, recovering Tanghu on the 14th. This area is located on the south bank of the Yi River and serves as an important supply base for the Communist troops.</p>
<h3>National Army in Southern Chahar Enters Hebei; Western Land and Zijingguan Recovered</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The National Army that recovered Yixian in the northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway has continued to advance west after detaching a part to join the attack on Mancheng. Yesterday, they recovered Western Land. It is also learned that the National Army from Weixian, Southern Chahar, in the Twelfth War Zone, has moved south, entered western Hebei, and recovered the strategically important Zijingguan to the west of Western Land. With this, Southern Chahar and western Hebei are connected, and the security of the Beiping-Baoding transportation route is strengthened.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] According to reliable sources, most of the few Communist troops in the Xushui and Yixian areas between Beiping and Baoding have been annihilated. The Beiping-Baoding line remains open to traffic as usual. Although Beiping is slightly on guard, there is absolutely no need to worry about defense and security.</p>
<h3>Changping Near Beiping</h3>
<p>Attacked Briefly Last Night</p>
<p>No Large Number of Communist Troops Near Tuoli</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The East and West Barracks near Changping on the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway were attacked by over a thousand Communist troops last night. Reinforcements arrived, and the Communist troops suffered heavy losses and retreated. There is also a Communist brigade forty li southeast of the Tumu Station.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The railway tracks damaged by the Communist troops between Zhangxin and Shunyi on the Beiping-Gubei Line have been repaired. The National Army is heavily guarded. Most of the Communist troops have been dispersed, and passenger trains are running directly to Miyun without obstruction in Shixia.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Yesterday, it was reported that over 20,000 Communist troops were discovered near Zhoukoudian, south of Beiping. According to a senior official from the headquarters, the military authorities have determined that there are fewer than 2,000 Communist troops entrenched near Zhoukoudian's Tuoli and that they have had minor contact with the National Army. The National Army is closely guarding the area. The reported 20,000 Communist troops were likely a misreporting.</p>
<h3>Sovereignty of the Supung Dam</h3>
<p>Expected to be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>Transmission Issues Still Under Negotiation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 14th] Regarding the electricity issue of the Supung Dam, according to Guo Ti, Director of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau, there are no concrete results yet, and negotiations are still ongoing. The issue of sovereignty of the Supung Dam is being directly negotiated by the Chinese and Soviet governments and is expected to be resolved soon. Before the resolution of this issue, the Northeast Electric Power Bureau can only conclude a temporary power supply agreement. However, it has not yet received a response from the North Korean Electric Power Bureau. Our side has begun actively repairing the power circuit from the Supung Dam to Anshan and the 20 railway lines along the way to meet the needs of power transmission. If negotiations are successful, approximately 100,000 kilowatts of electricity can be transmitted daily, with Anshan receiving 30,000 to 40,000 kilowatts and the rest supplied to Lüda and Andong.</p>
<h3>We are Building an Airfield</h3>
<p>in the Xisha Islands</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong Dispatch, 14th] Reports state that China will establish military and civilian airfields, radio stations, and meteorological stations on Macclesfield Bank in the southwest of the Xisha Islands. China and France have recently been in dispute over the sovereignty of these small islands.</p>
<h3>Cooke Arrives in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong Dispatch, 14th] Admiral Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, arrived in Hong Kong on his flagship at 8:00 AM on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Part of the U.S. Marine Corps</h3>
<p>Coming to China from Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco Dispatch, 13th] Approximately 1,400 U.S. Marine Corps soldiers are scheduled to depart for the Pacific on the 14th for Guadalcanal. Some may still be deployed to China, unaffected by the State Department's announcement of the imminent withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. According to a Marine Corps spokesman, the soldiers being deployed to China will mostly be stationed in Qingdao. They belong to the U.S. Seventh Fleet. Approximately a company of U.S. troops is stationed in Qingdao and will remain stationed there after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from other parts of China. The soldiers for Guadalcanal will depart from Pearl Harbor tomorrow aboard the General Breckinridge. U.S. officers and their families will accompany the ship to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Northeast Political Takeover</h3>
<p>Xiong Shihui Expresses Hope for Early Completion; Representatives from Lüda and Jinzhou Visit Troops and Civilians on the Outskirts of Dalian</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 14th] Xiong Shihui said: The Northeast is nearing the end of its political takeover. It is hoped that Dalian, Harbin, and Qiqihar can be formally taken over soon.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 14th] The Dalian Municipal Government's Shenyang Office, together with the Lüda-Jinzhou Fellow Countrymen Association in Shenyang and other groups, will organize a慰問團 and plans to depart from Shenyang around 6:00 PM this afternoon to visit the National Army and refugees on the outskirts of Dalian.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 14th] According to news from Dalian, after the Communist's Dalian Municipal Government was changed to the Lüda-Jinzhou Office, the police title was also abolished. Currently, those maintaining local security all wear badges. The name is nominally a local non-partisan organization, but in reality, it is a protective function and also a kind of posture.</p>
<h3>Sino-Philippine Treaty Negotiations</h3>

<h3>Gu Zhenggang Arrives in Tianjin from Tangshan; Says Pacification Work in Eastern Hebei Will Soon Come to an End; Bai Chongxi Attends Welcome Rally in Haimen</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 14th] Gu Zhenggang arrived in Tianjin by special train at 2:00 PM on the 14th. He told reporters that the Communist troops in eastern Hebei have collapsed both in spirit and in strength, and the pacification work will soon come to an end and enter the construction phase. According to captured 共軍, the general cadre of the Communist Party used the slogan of resistance during the war, but after the victory, they launched an internal rebellion, which is a case of "selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head." They have all deeply realized this. Awakened elements know that national interests are above class interests. Gu believes that the recent expansion of internal unrest by the Communist Party is only meant to cause chaos and will inevitably further lose their credibility internally, prompting more people to awaken. Gu will stay in Tianjin for two days to inspect social and labor administration before going to Beiping and then to Chengde and other places.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nantong Dispatch, 14th] Minister Bai Chongxi, Chairman Wang 慰功, and Commander-in-Chief Li 獃閹 and his entourage arrived in Haimen at 11:00 AM on the 14th to attend a public welcome rally.

<h3>Allocation of Physical Goods to Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Decision Made After Consultation Between the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Various Agencies; Can Be Implemented Starting March 1st</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The government's proposed method of allocating daily necessities to civil servants, which was intended to stabilize prices and secure the livelihood of the people, has been preliminarily decided after consultation between the relevant agencies at the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the afternoon of the 14th. Civil servants in 京, 滬, and other places can purchase six daily necessities—rice, coal, oil, salt, sugar, and cloth—at prices lower than market prices starting March 1st. It is said that each civil servant will be allocated goods based on a standard of three large 口 and two small 口, which is a considerable improvement over the method implemented in Chongqing and other places in the past. The meeting held by the Ministry of Economic Affairs today was chaired by Wang Yunwu. Attendees included Shen Xulun, Xiao Zheng, and Long Dajun from the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Pang Songzhou from the Ministry of Food; Bao Huaguo and Shou Miancheng from the Ministry of Social Affairs; Wu Weijing from the China Textile Corporation; Zhang Shanyang and Huang Peng from the Fuel Commission; Wu Zhaohong from the National Resources Commission; Zhang Decheng from the Vegetable Oil Factory; Chen Jiesheng from the Materials Bureau; He Weining from the Ministry of Finance; Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau; and Xie Zhengfu, Director of the 京 Social Affairs Bureau, totaling approximately 20 people. The meeting began at around 2:00 PM and ended at 5:45 PM. It was decided that civil servants, regardless of the number of people in their household, would all be calculated as three large 口 and two small 口. This can eliminate the past malpractice of falsely reporting household registrations. There will be six types of allocated goods. The Ministry of Finance will provide salt, the Ministry of Food will provide rice, the National Resources Commission will provide sugar, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will provide cloth, coal, and oil.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, who was summoned to 京 to attend the meeting of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, arrived in 京 on the morning of the 14th and immediately visited the relevant officials to exchange views on the plan for allocating daily necessities at subsidized prices. In the afternoon, he attended the meeting of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, providing several suggestions. After the meeting, he accompanied Wang Yunwu to meet with Song Ziwen.</p>
<p>Allocation Quantities</p>
<p>The allocation quantities are as follows: Each civil servant, including his family, will be allocated four jin of salt, eight dou of rice, four jin of sugar, four dan of coal briquettes, and three jin of oil per month. Civil servants themselves will receive 1.5 zhang of khaki cloth in the summer and 1.5 zhang of uniform wool in the winter. Family members will receive three zhang of cloth per year (0.5 dou and 1.5 pi per person).</p>
<p>Allocation Methods</p>
<p>The allocation method is that each agency will submit a roster to the Executive Yuan for review, which will then issue 物資配購證. The civil servants will then use their certificates to purchase goods at the cooperative. The entire method is named the "Applicable Goods Allocation Method." After the principles have been agreed upon, Pan Xulun is responsible for drafting them, which will be submitted to a small group committee tomorrow morning for detailed review. The entire method will be finalized at a general meeting tomorrow afternoon and then sent to the Executive Yuan for approval. It will be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council on the 16th, and it is expected to be implemented in 京, 滬, and other places on March 1st.</p>

<p>Results Expected Within Days</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Ministry of Finance has dispatched senior officials to Shanghai to investigate the truth about the gold rush and expects to obtain results in the near future.

<h3>Suggestions from the Beiping City Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Methods for Dealing with the Gold Rush</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The current financial turmoil has stimulated soaring prices, greatly affecting the people's livelihood. The Beiping City Party Headquarters Executive Committee convened a meeting to discuss the matter in detail. They believe that the government should quickly take effective measures and decided on five proposals to recommend to the central government for implementation. The contents are as follows: (1) Investigate the names of those who created the financial turmoil, confiscate their gold, and punish them for the crime of disrupting finance. (2) Prohibit the buying and selling of gold; violators will be severely punished. (3) Implement the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session, register the assets of officials, and suppress bureaucratic capital. (4) Nationalize private banks to eliminate the mischief of capital speculation. (5) Strictly control prices and stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>Sufficient Grain Reserves in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 14th] According to officials of the Beiping City Government, there is no shortage of grain reserves in Beiping. Although the city's population has increased slightly, and the daily consumption is considerable, the large quantities of grain recently purchased and transported from the Northeast and Northwest will be shipped to Beiping continuously. Some speculators, after selling gold, have turned to buying grain in an attempt to profit. If no major problems occur in transportation, their dreams of profit will certainly be shattered.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Finance Department Cracks Down</h3>
<p>Illegal Businesses</p>
<p>Rice Market Prices Enter a Stable State</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 14th] At 3:30 PM, the Finance Department issued an emergency order to crack down on 銀錢行號 operating without approval. Relevant agencies were dispatched to enforce the order. As a result, the business operations of eighty-three large businesses and thirty-three exchange shops operating concurrently as silver shops were suspended. The order was based on supplementary measures to the methods for the recovery of industries. According to this method, all 銀錢行號 established in Guangzhou after June 1936 are not allowed to operate. According to the person in charge of the Finance Department, after the method is implemented, only twelve shops in the city will be allowed to continue operating. This move will be very beneficial in preventing future financial speculation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 14th] Due to the authorities' decisive actions and the effective implementation of measures, rice prices have fallen rapidly to the level before the 11th. On the 14th, the price of top-grade rice in the market was 120,000 yuan per dan, and medium-grade rice was 110,000 yuan, which is in a stable state.</p>

<h3>Council Resolution Passed</h3>
<p>Organize a Financial Review Committee; Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, and Others Attended and Reported Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Council Resident Committee held a regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th. Over 20 people were in attendance, including Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Wu Yifang, Chuan Sinian, and Luo Heng. Mo Dehui presided, and Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Gu Zhenglun, and Zhou Yichun attended. First, Shao Lizi delivered a written report on diplomacy. Then, Zhou Yichun reported on recent agricultural and forestry administrative facilities. He stated that the cotton harvest last year was 8 million dan, and it is expected that this year it should be 12 million dan. The use of land for tobacco is mostly in the豫, 皖, and 魯 areas and is currently being planned. The silk industry has been severely damaged by the Japanese, and efforts are now being made to improve it. Taiwan produces the most tea, and in the future, attention will be paid to the production in Qimen, Tunxi, and other places in China. Last year, the export of tung oil totaled 37,000 tons, and this year it may reach around 50,000 tons. Other items such as wool and sugar will also be improved to increase production. Then, Wang Yunwu explained the reasons for the recent surge in prices, stating that the main reason is the excessive amount of floating capital. Shanghai is a concentrated area of industry and commerce, and capital from various places is also concentrated there. Due to the instability of the situation, many people are afraid to invest in fixed businesses, so capital becomes floating capital. In addition: (1) The issuance of large-denomination banknotes. (2) Limited foreign exchange, unlimited supply. (3) Exported goods adopt subsidies. Merchants scramble to buy gold and U.S. dollars, so foreign goods rise, and domestic goods follow suit. Although the government has adopted a policy of selling gold and grain, it has not had a significant effect. Wang advocates: (1) Adopting effective methods to make gold and currency lose their role as intermediaries. (2) Strictly controlling prices and restoring the wartime control system. (3) Stabilizing industry and commerce.</p>
<p>After Wang's report, Yu Hongjun reported on the reasons for the rise in gold and foreign exchange. Stabilizing gold prices is the most important task at present. The government has decided to adopt a comprehensive method of financial control, which is being drafted. He also said that the current problem is not with finance itself but that the fundamental problem should be solved.</p>
<p>Then, Gu Zhenglun reported, stating that the reason for the high grain prices is the rise in prices. To prevent grain prices from increasing, it is necessary to suppress prices first.</p>
<p>Then, council members raised inquiries. Chuan Sinian first said that Song, the army commander, should be held responsible for the current chaotic situation. He suggested that the government immediately implement effective measures to save the current crisis; otherwise, they would all resign from their positions as council members. Later, Luo Heng, Su Ting, Wang Puhan, Xue Mingjian, Wu Chunwu, Yin Shuxian, Zheng Kuiyi, and others successively raised questions. There was much criticism regarding the handling of foreign exchange and gold. Wang and Yu answered each question in turn. Finally, it was resolved to pass a resolution to form a financial and economic review committee by the council members, which was scheduled to hold a review meeting at 9:00 AM on the 15th and a plenary meeting of the resident committee at 9:00 AM on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Current Financial and Economic Policies: Legislative Yuan Conducts a Comprehensive Review; Today's Meeting Will Focus on Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] The Legislative Yuan held its 314th plenary session on the morning of the 14th. The legislators, with heavy hearts, conducted a comprehensive review of the current issues of gold notes and commodity prices. It was generally agreed that China is now facing a severe economic crisis, and a thorough review of the entire financial and economic policy is necessary. Some legislators even proposed inviting Premier Song to report on his administration's policies to the Yuan. Finally, it was decided to continue the meeting on the morning of the 15th to conduct a more detailed review of commodity price issues. Today's meeting was presided over by President Sun, with 68 legislators in attendance. After amending and passing the draft legislative principles for the Four National Banks Law, the agenda was changed to hear reports from the Nine-Member Committee. First, Lou Tongsheng, chairman of the Economic Committee, reported on the joint meeting held on the 11th. Then, Li Qing, convener of the Nine-Member Committee, reported on the conclusions reached by the committee over the past few months in studying current financial, economic, and monetary issues, which were divided into seven points: (1) commodity prices, (2) gold and U.S. dollars, (3) state-owned enterprises and illegal overspending, (4) public bonds, (5) import and export trade, (6) salaries of public servants, teachers, military, and police personnel, and (7) institutions. He added a detailed review and explained that he resigned due to his inability to work. Wang Yuxiang believed that the current economic and financial situation has reached this point, the people's livelihood is increasingly difficult, and society has such high expectations for the Legislative Yuan. There should be a solemn expression in the meeting to curb the rising trend. Lou Tongsheng pointed out that the situation in Shanghai is chaotic, and the adverse impact on the country is significant. American newspapers say that we are on the verge of chaos and at the end of the world. Standing in the position of government officials and in the position of the people, I fully agree with the report. For the sake of seriousness, the Legislative Yuan should hold a special meeting on the issue of commodity prices and invite Army Chief Song to come to the Yuan to explain, so as to give a frank review of the current overall situation. Lou expressed his support for the proposal of some legislators to nationalize gold, believing that this proposal could have a positive impact on the chaotic financial situation. He cited the words of a U.S. government official, explaining that the U.S. had hinted at why we did not use the $35.64 million currently frozen in the U.S. If this amount could be nationalized, it could at least have some impact. Jian Guansan pointed out that after the surge in gold notes, the living standards of the general salaried class have been reduced by half. Our country is now facing the final economic juncture, and it is necessary to invite Premier Song to explain. Sun Jiuxi, who recently returned to Nanjing from Shanghai, reported on the truth of the gold rush he witnessed in Shanghai, pointing out that the prices at which the Central Bank sold gold were sometimes higher than the market price, which clearly had a suspicion of leading the rise. Peng Chunshi pointed out that this gold rush was related to loans, citing that food prices rose soon after agricultural loans were issued. After industrial loans were issued last autumn, commodity prices rose. At the end of the year, as production loans were issued, gold notes were frantically poured, which sufficiently proves that loans fueled the rising trend. Zhong Tianxin, Qi Zhihou, Li Jinfang, and others also made serious criticisms of the current situation. Finally, it was decided to continue the plenary session on the 15th to discuss the financial and commodity price issues again. The meeting adjourned at about 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Revised Draft Legislative Principles for the Four National Banks Law</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] The draft legislative principles for the Four National Banks Law of China, China, Communications, and Morning were amended and passed at the 314th plenary session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 14th. Among them, the discussion on the draft legislative principles for the Central Bank Law was the most detailed. Ji Chaoding, director of the Economic Research Institute of the Central Bank, and Cui Weiwu and two others were also present at the meeting to answer questions. After the proposal was put forward, Chen Changheng, chairman of the Finance Committee, first reported on the repeated review process, explaining that the current draft has been greatly simplified compared to the past. The board of directors was originally scheduled to be composed of 21 people, but due to the excessive number of people and the difficulty of selecting candidates from professional groups, it was decided to reduce it to 15 people, with the following distribution: (1) five ex officio directors from the central government, (2) four economic and financial experts, (3) one person each from the banking, agriculture, mining, industry, commerce, and labor sectors with rich experience, and (4) the president of the Central Bank, for a total of 15 people. Items 3 and 4 are appointed and selected by the government. Then, the legislators discussed whether the Central Bank should be supervised by the Ministry of Finance. The debate was particularly heated. The representatives of the Central Bank, Ji Chaoding and others, hoped to change "supervised by the Ministry of Finance" to "supervised by the government," arguing that if the Central Bank is supervised by the Ministry of Finance, it would be subordinate to the Ministry of Finance in the organizational system. The missions of national finance and monetary policy are not entirely the same, and it seems necessary to have separate systems. Zhang Zhaoyuan and others argued that it is better to maintain the original plan, because all kinds of banks are supervised by the Ministry of Finance. If the Central Bank forms its own system, it will be difficult to supervise, and if the Central Bank has no supervisory relationship with the Ministry of Finance, there is a risk that financial and political policies will run counter to each other. It was later decided to maintain the original proposal. Another controversial issue was whether the Central Bank has the special privilege to buy and sell raw gold and silver. Some legislators, in view of the current surge in gold notes, believed that this kind of special privilege of the Central Bank should be restricted. President Sun and others believed that this was only a temporary phenomenon and should not be restricted in the law stipulating a century-long plan. It was also decided to follow the original proposal. Finally, there was a heated debate on whether the president and staff of the Central Bank should be subject to qualification review. After the entire proposal was amended, it was passed. The draft legislative principles of the Bank of China Law and others did not have much discussion and were passed smoothly. The difference from the past is that the number of directors has been reduced to 15, and the chairman has been changed to the chairman of the board of directors.</p>

Therefore, after listing the remaining materiel of the U.S. side of the Chongchong Mediation Department, it will be transferred to the Materiel Supply Bureau once all U.S. personnel have been evacuated, with machinery and equipment being the most numerous. The working period of the Surplus Materiel Disposal Committee may be extended until the autumn of next year and will establish an office in Okinawa Island in the near future.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Assassination Case in Beiping; U.S. Soldier Shot and Killed; Incident Occurred at the Same Location as the Shen Chong Case</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 14th] A bizarre case of a U.S. soldier being shot occurred in the ancient capital last night. At about 10 p.m., three U.S. soldiers went to the Dahua Cinema to watch a movie. Because the cinema was out of power and there was no performance, they went to a club instead. While walking along Rongchang Hutong, the three U.S. soldiers, walking arm in arm, heard a very faint sound. Immediately, one soldier fell to the ground. The other two soldiers were shocked and rushed forward to check. They learned that the soldier had been shot from behind and was injured. They immediately helped him to the U.S. Army Hospital. However, the injured soldier was a first-class private in the Marine Corps, and the Army Hospital did not dare to perform surgery rashly to remove the bullet from his back. Today, he was sent to the Tianjin Naval Hospital for treatment by the Marine Corps. The U.S. military has not announced the name of the injured U.S. soldier today. It is only known that his two companions were Sergeant Choi Erchak and Private Srobort. The occurrence of this case is very bizarre. Two hours after the incident, the Ping Police Bureau received a report and is currently investigating the murderer. (Note: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping, the U.S. soldier was a cook in the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Marine Regiment. He died 20 minutes after being shot. This case occurred in the same area as the Shen Chong incident. According to an Associated Press dispatch, the U.S. Marine Corps Investigation Bureau convened a meeting at 1 p.m. on the 13th to discuss the investigation of this case.)</p>
<h3>U.S. Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 14th] U.S. authorities have recently issued the first detailed statement regarding the mysterious shooting death of a Marine Corps soldier. U.S. authorities have also confirmed that the soldier was shot in a small street in the urban area of Beiping, suffering a small-caliber bullet wound. The murderer fled into the darkness.</p>
<p>The U.S. military statement is as follows: "A first-class Marine Corps private in Beiping was shot and killed on the way back from the outside on the evening of the 13th. Officials believe that the deceased died from a small-caliber bullet wound. The exact cause of death will be determined after an autopsy by the U.S. military headquarters in Tianjin.</p>
<p>The soldier was sent to the Army Hospital at 9:50 p.m. on the 13th with a gunshot wound to the back. He died five minutes after being admitted to the hospital. According to Sergeant Choi Erkerk and Private Sri, who were with the deceased at the time, when they reached the British Embassy on Morridge Street, they heard a sound similar to an explosion. The deceased suddenly shouted, 'I've been shot! I've been shot in the back!' At first, his companions thought the deceased was joking, but then they saw blood flowing from his mouth, so they quickly called a rickshaw to help him into the car and went to the Army Hospital. However, he died without treatment.</p>
<p>According to later informal reports, three Marine Corps members were traveling together. The one who was shot and killed was in the middle. The bullet hit near the center of the heart. The U.S. soldier died 20 minutes later. According to most eyewitnesses, only one shot was fired, and no one else was injured. The murderer disappeared into the darkness in an instant. They also said that the U.S. soldier was shot and killed after leaving the cinema. The cinema closed at 8 p.m., and many Chinese people left at the same time. Beiping usually implements a curfew starting at midnight every night, but after the incident today, martial law was declared at 10 p.m."</p>
<h3>Canadian Ambassador to Come to China; Building a Gold House as Embassy</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Ottawa, 14th] The new Canadian Ambassador to China, Davis, is scheduled to travel to China by ship from San Francisco in late this month. Having heard of the housing shortage in Nanjing, he decided to buy a piece of vacant land that had been confiscated in the past and build three mobile homes on the spot for temporary residence as a precautionary measure. The houses and furniture will be shipped from Vancouver Port by Chinese ships. A Canadian carpenter, who has lived in China for 30 years, will go to Nanjing to supervise the construction of the houses, so that everything is properly arranged, waiting for the new ambassador to take office.</p>
<h3>German Overseas Chinese in China, After Repatriation, Fall from Paradise into Hell</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The reporter interviewed a dozen German families who were repatriated from "paradise"-like China a few months ago. They are currently living a miserable life of hunger and hardship with other Berliners. Most of the Germans who were repatriated were Nazi Party members. Their current plight is a stark contrast to their luxurious lives when they went to China before the war, with delicious food and maids. Among them, some people are still able to endure and face the situation calmly. A German named Hao said, "Good! Everyone has their own experiences. It's our turn now!" Among the Germans who were repatriated to Germany, there are also a small number of British wives who also live in the war-damaged city of Berlin. They are former employees who were repatriated to their home countries along with their husbands. A man named Yobo, who used to work at the Shanghai Siemens Electric Appliance Company, has found a job as a wireless repairman.

<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party's List of Participants in the Government to Be Submitted Within the Next Week; A Special Person Will Be Sent to Beijing for Government Announcement</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to an estimate by a senior official of the Democratic Socialist Party, the list of personnel from the Democratic Socialist Party who will participate in the government can be submitted before the 20th of this month. At that time, a special person will be sent to Beijing for the government to formally announce. In terms of procedure, the first to be announced will probably be the members of the Legislative Yuan. The selection of candidates this time is quite cautious, especially for members of the Legislative Yuan and members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. Taking the candidates for the Legislative Yuan as an example, in addition to being familiar with political matters, they also need considerable academic cultivation in order to be successful. It is heard that the list submitted will include many presidents, professors, and scholars. The current difficulty is that the work of the Legislative Yuan is a regular one, and those who take office must resign from their original positions. However, the Legislative Yuan will have to be completely re-elected at the time of constitutional implementation, and the period is too short, so there is inevitably some hesitation.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Handling Rationing</h3>
<p>The rationing system has gradually become concrete due to this wave of commodity price increases. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is coordinating the measures. The municipal meeting has concluded, and the general consumers, especially the wage-earning class, are naturally very excited. The main reasons for implementing the rationing system are twofold: one is the shortage of materials, using rationing to seek a reasonable distribution, and the other is the high commodity prices, using rationing to seek stability in life. Judging from the current situation, high commodity prices are an undeniable fact, and although material shortages are not a universal phenomenon, at least part of it is also true that demand exceeds supply and the source is not sustained. Therefore, adopting rationing measures as a means of emergency action is theoretically undeniable.</p>
<p>Now, the specific measures have not yet been fully decided. In terms of implementation, we would like to contribute a few opinions.</p>
<p>(1) We must first grasp the materials. Whether it is to supply the public or to suppress commodity prices, the first step is to grasp the rationed materials. Especially for the sake of suppressing commodity prices. Without grasping all the materials, there is no hope of success. Therefore, we must pay attention to this point at the beginning. Fortunately, there are now many daily necessities, such as cotton cloth, sugar, oil, coal, and rice. The central government has established special management or monopoly institutions. As long as the competent authorities sincerely cooperate and are willing to provide all the materials for rationing as an example, then, the news will spread, and it seems that it will not be difficult to gradually promote it. What becomes a problem is that rationed items must be sold at a fair price, which is different from purely profit-making businesses. In the UK, the US, Hong Kong, and other places, many ration prices are even set below the purchase price. That is to say, the government is willing to lose money in order to maintain the lives of the public. Do we have this spirit of sacrifice prepared? It is worth considering carefully beforehand.</p>
<p>(2) There must be meticulous planning. Whether it is overall rationing or partial rationing, the number of people receiving rations is not small. The types, quantities, prices, dates, and all procedures for rationing must be simple and clear. This method is by no means comparable to the official writing of this kind of command, nor can the official writing of this kind of command be effective. During the Anti-Japanese War, in the occupied areas and in the rear, we can still recall the lessons of this kind of failure. Therefore, how the methods are stipulated, how the institutions are organized, and how the funds are raised must be planned in advance. It is not advisable to create names out of thin air and add many redundant personnel, nor is it advisable to simplify and facilitate matters, which will hinder the progress of the work. Because this work is a business, and a very complex business, not just an administration, it requires scientific methods and systematic cooperation. If you intend to save trouble, only seek convenience, generalize and cover up, and perfunctorily deal with it, then the future effect seems easy to guess.</p>
<p>(3) There must be an iron-like discipline. The so-called iron-like discipline refers not only to the personnel handling the matter, but also to the general recipients of rations. Such as falsely reporting the number of people, one person with two registrations, relying on strength to extort, deliberately squeezing, and other malpractices, without the sincere cooperation and self-restraint of the general recipients of rations, it is really not easy to be meticulous and achieve a state of eradicating malpractices. But looking at the example of the British in recent days, in order to relieve the coal shortage, everyone恪遵功令, automatically stopping the power supply, we can know that their political orders are so effective, it is indeed not accidental. We are now handling rationing. On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will be fair and impartial, to eliminate the past bad habits of营私舞弊. On the other hand, we also need the public to adhere to discipline and not give economic people a chance to manipulate it.</p>
<p>In order to stabilize commodity prices and stabilize life, we are forced to implement the rationing of daily necessities. This seems to be the last resort. Therefore, we only hope that this method will succeed and can no longer watch it fail. Because we only allow it to succeed, we hope that they will carefully study personnel, funding, materials, and methods in all aspects, and never take it lightly.</p>

Jiawang currently has 3,800 workers, producing 1,200 tons of coal per day. Although the per capita daily production rate of 0.45 tons is inferior to the output of over three tons per day by American miners, their ability to achieve this result under conditions of limited production tools is still commendable.

<h3>Gansu Treasures: Yumen Gasoline Production Can Be Increased; Medicinal Herbs Everywhere Used as Firewood</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 14th] Gansu is known as the "Gasoline Depot," and the Yumen Oil Mine was once regarded as a national treasure during the war. Although production has declined sharply, it is still the only modernized oil mine in China. Gansu is also known as the "Home of Medicinal Herbs." Of the 300 commonly used medicines listed in the "Compendium of Materia Medica," Gansu produces more than 240 varieties. The current situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Yumen [unclear action] produces 230,000 gallons of gasoline per month. Recently, with the installation of a new refining furnace, production can be increased to 300,000 gallons per month. The official price is 5,500 yuan per gallon, while the black market price in Lanzhou is 16,000 yuan per gallon. Limited sales still cannot meet demand. The by-product, kerosene, [unclear action] about 100,000 gallons, is sold to Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces. The Lanzhou official price is 5,500 yuan per gallon, while the black market price is 9,000 yuan per gallon. The oil [unclear] expenses are huge and insufficient to cover costs, resulting in a monthly loss of about 600 million yuan.</p>
<p>Gansu's medicinal herb production ranks second in the country, second only to Sichuan. However, in terms of variety, Sichuan is not as good as Gansu. In particular, Min Dang (Angelica sinensis from Min County) is famous in the world. Local residents use it instead of flour, which shows how cheap and abundant it is. Angelica is also an important medicine in Western China and accounts for a considerable portion of exports. The Gansu authorities planned to [unclear action] sell it abroad to exchange for production machinery, but this has not yet been realized. Astragalus, rhubarb, and Codonopsis pilosula are almost ubiquitous medicinal herbs in Gansu Province. Angelica costs 20,000 yuan per 100 catties, Codonopsis pilosula 150,000 yuan, and supports 120,000 people. Deer velvet costs 50,000 yuan per liang for top quality and 10,000 yuan per liang for lower quality, almonds 100,000 yuan per 100 catties, rhubarb 18,000 yuan, licorice 50,000 yuan, wolfberries 4 million yuan, and bezoar 700,000 yuan per liang. Angelica exports this month are about 20,000 piculs.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Pardons Military Law Prisoners; Ministry of Judicial Administration Restricts Military Law Authority</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 14th] Since the issuance of the National Government's amnesty decree, all judicial criminals in this county who meet the amnesty conditions have been pardoned. However, military law criminals have not yet been pardoned, causing anxiety among the prisoners. They previously jointly petitioned the county government, requesting early pardon, commutation, or exemption from prosecution in accordance with the amnesty decree. According to Wei Duanmin, the county military law officer, there are over 30 military law criminals in this county, all of whom meet the amnesty conditions. However, due to waiting for the implementation order from the Provincial Security Command, they have been [unclear action] until today.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 14th] Regarding cases of drug prohibition, drug eradication, and punishment of bandits, military agencies and courts in various places have many doubts about their authority. Military agencies believe that, according to item 5 of the second provision of the Temporary Emergency Military and Political Measures for Pacification Zones and the Nine Northeastern Provinces promulgated by the Executive Yuan, military law agencies still apply the regulations for punishing bandits, etc., and their acceptance of cases is not limited to cases where the defendant is a soldier, so they have the authority to try them. Courts believe that except for cases where the defendant is a soldier, all cases are under judicial jurisdiction, and the Executive Yuan has already issued a circular to be followed. Therefore, the two sides hold different opinions, which inevitably leads to [unclear] obstacles. The Ministry of Judicial Administration explained that the provisions of the above-mentioned measures are obviously inconsistent with Article 9 of the Constitution and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for deletion. Before the provisions are deleted, if the defendant is not a soldier, the cases will still be handled by the local courts as before. After receiving the order, the Jiangsu High Court has instructed the local courts to comply and has also sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Security Command for their information.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu High Procuratorate Orders Arrest of Ninety-Seven Puppet County Magistrates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] The Jiangsu High Procuratorate believes that the Ministry of Judicial Administration previously promulgated that reports on traitorous criminals must be made by the victims, and third-party reports will not be accepted by the courts. However, this is only limited to unimportant ordinary small traitors, and the reporting of traitors who have served in puppet positions should still be intensified without any slackening. The Jiangsu High Procuratorate recently compiled a form of the puppet county magistrates in various counties of Jiangsu Province who have been reported and are fleeing without a trace, detailing the names, ages, origins, and characteristics of each traitor, totaling as many as ninety-seven. It has issued a notice to the local procuratorates of all counties to strictly arrest them and bring them to justice. The list of traitors is recorded as follows:</p>

More than 60 other small and medium-sized silk factories are unable to start operations, resulting in the unemployment of approximately 10,000 workers. Although the silk market has now turned around, with standard silk selling for 7 million yuan per dan, exceeding the official purchase price of the China Trust Bureau, there is still no profit due to the increased cost of production. Currently, the market price of dried cocoons in Wuxi is 1.2 million yuan per dan, and farmers have no goods to sell, with all the cocoons stored in hoarders' warehouses.</p>

<h3>Government Suppresses Commodity Prices with Utmost Determination, Five Agencies Form Economic Supervisory Group, Emergency Measures to be Completed within Five Days, Aiming to Restore Prices to the Levels Before February 1st</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] The current general price surge triggered by the gold rush has drawn great concern from Chairman Chiang, especially the impact of financial fluctuations on the national economy. In addition to dispatching Group Leader Xiang Jiemin of the Second Group of the Military Command Department to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the matter, he also dispatched a special envoy yesterday, ordering Shanghai Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu to immediately organize an economic reconnaissance outline and formulate emergency measures to suppress commodity prices. After receiving the order, Xuan has already begun to implement it and held a press conference at the headquarters at 4 pm yesterday, making the following important remarks:</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, in light of the abnormal fluctuations in finance and commodity prices in Shanghai, which are obviously manipulated by someone, specifically instructed me to organize an economic reconnaissance outline immediately, determined to use human power to suppress the artificial price surge. This reconnaissance outline will be jointly organized by capable and experienced personnel selected from the five institutions of the Garrison Headquarters, the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, the Police Bureau, the Military Intelligence Bureau, and the Central Intelligence Bureau, and I will be in overall command. The emergency measures to suppress commodity prices must be completed within five days.</p>
<p>Xuan continued that the organization of the reconnaissance outline, this morning (14th), has been designed and decided with the persons in charge of the relevant agencies to establish an economic supervision group, responsible for decision-making and command, and according to the current three objectives that must be done and can be done, three groups have been set up, a gold and banknote group, a food group, and a yarn and cloth group. The work of each group will first investigate the illegal merchants who speculate, manipulate, or monopolize the market. As for the emergency measures, although they still need to be designed with the relevant parties, the principles have already been decided. Once the illegal merchants who deliberately raise prices, manipulate, or hoard goods are found to be true, they will be sanctioned. If there are legal grounds for sanctions, they will be strictly dealt with according to the law. If they exceed the law, they will be dealt with according to military law in accordance with the emergency measures or the regulations for controlling commodity prices during extraordinary periods. In order to immediately launch practical work, the reconnaissance outline has already begun to take action.</p>
<p>The existence period of the reconnaissance outline will depend on the actual needs. If it is indeed necessary to exist permanently, a permanent economic reconnaissance agency will be established separately. In addition to being presided over by personnel from the five units of the military, police, military police, and military intelligence in accordance with the Chairman's instructions, the agency will also invite experts familiar with market conditions and economic experts as consultants.</p>
<p>Xuan finally emphasized that the government has absolute determination to suppress commodity prices this time. At a minimum, it must restore the standard before February 1st. At the same time, he hopes that the city will only report as many illegal merchants who hoard and manipulate as possible, because the current selfishness of a few people harms the survival of the majority, which is no different from being an enemy of the public. In order to protect the interests of the majority of the people, the government will resolutely dispose of them, so that the crazy commodity prices will return to normal, and he hopes that the press will assist them.</p>

In light of this, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, after consulting with oil companies such as Asiatic Petroleum, Standard Oil, and Texaco, has decided to implement a rationing system starting March 1st to prevent hoarding. The rationing method involves each car owner obtaining an application form from gas stations, filling in the vehicle type and registration number, and the required amount of gasoline. The company authorities will then, based on reasonable standards, determine the monthly fuel consumption for each vehicle and issue a ration card. From then on, all vehicles must present the ration card to refuel at gas stations, and the total monthly amount must not exceed the approved amount. No vehicle owner may obtain ration cards from more than two companies. The three oil companies have scheduled to publish a notice in the newspaper today, informing all car owners to register and apply.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of the Gold Rush Begins: Inspecting All Account Books, Extracting the Names of Buyers, Sharp Drop in Gold Prices, Market Stalls Invisibly, Investigation of Gold Shops and Silver Exchanges Continues Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After Chairman Chiang dispatched Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the Military Affairs Commission, to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the gold rush in the city, starting yesterday noon, officers dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters and the Police Bureau went to Tong Feng Yu, Tai Kang Run, and Da Feng Heng, three gold shops, and Fang Jiu Xia Chang Ji and Yang Qing He, two silver exchanges, which are normally authorized by the Central Bank to allocate and sell gold. They inquired about daily transactions, confiscated all transaction ledgers from the five establishments, and extracted the number of gold allocations and sales, names of purchasing customers, business licenses of trading counterparts, addresses, etc. At the same time, summons were separately issued to the five responsible individuals, Zhan Yunsheng, Ying Minghe, Ni Zuguang, Zhang Yuanbai, and Xie Bingquan, to the Police Bureau for questioning, with statements recorded separately. It is said that the confiscated account books are undergoing strict review to thoroughly investigate whether there were any actions manipulating gold prices and disrupting the financial market during this gold rush. It is reported that for thorough investigation, a second round of investigations will be launched today, with the investigation targets including gold trading houses, securities firms, and small private banks. If solid evidence of illegal activities is found, the most severe penalties will be imposed. The details and truth of the investigation are expected to be released publicly soon.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's daily gold sales are divided into two methods: allocation and sale. For allocation, gold shops collectively apply to the Central Bank through Tong Feng Yu, Tai Kang Run, Da Feng Heng, and Fang Jiu Xia. Silver shops collectively apply to the Central Bank through Yang Qing He silver exchange. The Central Bank allocates gold at its discretion at 10 a.m. every day. After the allocation, the Central Bank entrusts the gold shops to sell gold on its behalf based on market fluctuations. Since the 10th of this month, the Central Bank has temporarily suspended the allocation to gold shops under orders from the authorities. According to the person in charge of Tong Ying Yu gold shop, the shop has suspended trading since the Central Bank stopped allocating gold to gold shops.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market invisibly stalled as the authorities began a thorough investigation of gold shops and silver exchanges. Gold shops collectively suspended trading. Unofficial after-market bids broke through the six million yuan barrier, reaching a low of 5.8 million yuan. At silver shop retail outlets, more people were selling than buying. According to the person in charge of a major silver shop on Nanjing Road: statistics for the past two days show that daily revenue at retail outlets reached 90 taels, while sales only reached over 60 taels, a reversal of the run on silver shops during the gold price surge. Since silver shops' revenue exceeded sales, the amount of gold applied for from the Central Bank daily also greatly decreased, with 49 bars yesterday and only 450,000 bars the day before.</p>

The executive directors of the union admitted to holding several meetings nine days ago to discuss preparations for the meeting. The letter to the Xindu Theater renting the venue stated that it was an economic issue lecture, but the theater found out the purpose of the meeting and refused, indicating impure motives, and the executive directors of the union should be responsible. According to the investigation results, the causes of the incident were nothing more than: 1. The attendees were crowded, and some people could not enter the venue; 2. The content of the meeting did not match the name, causing public dissatisfaction, resulting in conflict. Although the department store unions in the three districts believed that there were special elements directing the incident, the union specially set up pickets with marked badges during the meeting, and the arrangement seemed to be quite thorough, indicating prior preparation. However, since the incident has already occurred, the government and judicial authorities should continue to thoroughly investigate and severely punish the perpetrators. It is hoped that the Municipal Council will express a serious position. Regarding the promotion of domestic goods, it is also requested to formulate a plan and officially promote it.</p>
<p>The committee believes that the council is not in a position to set up another organization to promote domestic goods and should request the municipal government to handle it.

<h3>Dredger "Jianshe" Discovered in the Baltic Sea: Has Been Salvaged by the Soviet Side, Notifying Our Country to Provide Proof for Verification and Release</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The dredger "Jianshe," ordered by the Shanghai Shenpu Bureau from the Xue Gao Shipyard in Germany before the war, has been discovered in a certain location in the Baltic Sea in the Soviet-occupied area. It has been salvaged by the Soviet Union, which is notifying our country to submit various documents for verification and release. In order to dredge the Shentan shoal at the mouth of the Yangtze River, the Shanghai Shenpu Bureau planned to dredge the Shentan to facilitate the passage of ships with a high tide draft of 37 feet and a water draft of 33 feet. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, it formulated a plan to dredge the Shentan and mainly relied on two dredgers built at the Xue Gao Shipyard in Germany, one named "Fuxing," weighing 8,400 tons, and one named "Jianshe," weighing 9,500 tons.</p>
<p>Preparing to Restore and Dredge the Shentan</p>
<p>The "Fuxing" arrived in Shanghai in 1936, and the "Jianshe" was built in 1937. When it was about to leave the factory, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and the national army withdrew to the west. The bureau entrusted the factory to take care of it and signed a contract. The "Fuxing" was occupied by the enemy and sailed to Tokyo. After the victory of the War of Resistance two years ago, the bureau requested the government to demand the "Fuxing" from Japan last year. At the same time, it urged the Xue Gao Shipyard to deliver the "Jianshe." In February of last year, the bureau learned that the "Jianshe" had sunk in the Baltic Sea in the Soviet-occupied area during the German-Soviet war, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inquired with the Soviet Union. In July, the Soviet Union salvaged the "Jianshe" and notified our country to submit documents for verification and release. The Shanghai Shenpu Bureau was ordered to retrieve the shipbuilding contract, entrusted custody puncture copies, and payment receipts, and sent them to the Ministry of Finance at the beginning of the month for transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in preparation for notifying the Soviet Union. It is learned that the "Fuxing" is currently being repaired intensively, and the landmarks and buoys of the Shenntan shoal must also be newly manufactured. The dredging work of the Shenntan can be restored in three months.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Nanshi Beiqu Fire Brigade: Private Fire Organization, Excellent Performance</h3>
<p>[Special Report by This Newspaper] On the first day of the New Year, a big fire on Seymour Road burned for thirteen hours, and half a street's worth of houses, property, and the years of hard work of the victims were instantly turned to ashes. "Natural disasters" are already unfortunate, coupled with the "man-made" exploitation of the fire, what could be more poisonous than this?</p>
<p>Li Zhiliang, Director of the Nanshi Beiqu Fire Brigade (Photographed by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Because the Seymour Road fire itself included many complex causes, after nearly twenty days of investigation, the truth has come to light, and human factors account for an important portion. In addition to the investigation work, the five-member fire investigation committee then visited the fire department and several privately run fire-fighting organizations, with the aim of making a comparison between official and private. Mao Jingchou, the current chairman of the Nanqu Fire Brigade Federation, replied to Director Ge of the investigation committee: "Whether it is official or private, it is not easy to do well with money, and it is not easy to do well without money." The fact is indeed like this, the only good thing is that "private operators can 'save a lot of paper.'" In recent days, many people have advocated for private fire brigades, and their reasoning is aimed at strengthening the efficiency of fire-fighting work.</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed Zhao Zhiliang, the director of the Nanshi Beiqu Fire Brigade in Shanghai. He gave a general overview of the current fire-fighting organizations in Shanghai and the situation of the fire brigade in the district.</p>
<p>The current fire-fighting organizations in Shanghai, in addition to the fire department under the jurisdiction of the police bureau, also include the fire brigades in the districts of Husi, Zhabei, Zhenru, Wusong, Jiangwan, Pudong, and Hunan. After the destruction and destruction by the enemy and puppets, most of the equipment in the various districts has been lost and cannot cope with the current needs. Only the two districts of Hunan Zhongbei, because they were划入into the refugee area, have been able to partially preserve the fire-fighting equipment.</p>
<p>Founded in the Late Guangxu Period: Expenses Raised by Residents</p>
<p>The Hunan District Fire Brigade was founded in the 33rd year of Guangxu, and the expenses have been automatically donated by the residents of the district on a monthly basis since the beginning. At that time, there were more than 30 fire-fighting groups inside and outside Shanghai's city walls. Because the organizations were divided, the highest efficiency could not be achieved when fighting fires. Later, after discussion by the persons in charge of each group, the groups were merged to form the current Hunan Fire-fighting Federation, which is divided into five district fire brigades in the east, west, north, south, and middle. It is stipulated that the members of the volunteer team in each district must not only provide their own uniforms but also be responsible for fundraising in the district. They must immediately mobilize during an alarm. Most of the employees and team members are residents of the district. The highest monthly salary is now 160,000 yuan, and the lowest is only 40,000 yuan, but because of the work, they almost cannot leave the office all day. Since its opening, it has had a very good performance. In terms of fire-fighting equipment, before the war, the five districts had more than 30 pump cars, ladder cars, belt cars, and ambulances, and more than 1,000 fire hydrants. After being destroyed by the enemy and puppets, the five districts now have a total of more than 20 vehicles and only more than 300 fire hydrants left, most of which need to be repaired before they can be used. The Beiqu currently has five pump cars and one belt car, and 20 belts. Recently, the team members raised more than 20 million yuan and installed a new ambulance. Director Zhao said with a smile, "If it were run by the government, I'm afraid it wouldn't be installed in half a year."</p>
<p>Do Not Object to Government Assistance: Just Afraid of Not Knowing How to Make a Budget</p>
<p>Talking about their work and the situation of dispatching fire alarms, he said: The association stipulates that two fire trucks should be dispatched for fire alarms in this district, and one fire truck should be dispatched for each of the other districts. The number of dispatched team members is determined according to the fire situation. They do not object to government assistance, but they are afraid of not knowing how to make a budget.</p>
<p>They hope to become a national model of private fire brigades. They have a high degree of service spirit.</p>

<h3>Initial Trial of the Collision Case of Two Ships: Two Captains Released on Bail</h3>
<h3>Uproar Erupted from the Gallery After the Verdict Was Announced</h3>
<h3>Xin and Zhang's Statements Both Claimed All Passengers on Board Were Rescued</h3>
<h3>Ticketing Manager Testified That At Least Twenty or Thirty People Drowned</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of the collision between the Zhijiang and Huatong ships has been investigated by the District Procuratorate, which believes that both captains were at fault. After public prosecution was initiated against both, the District Court held a preliminary hearing yesterday, with a full audience. According to Xin Chengfang, the captain of the Zhijiang, the ship left the Shanghai dock at 10:30 PM on January 17th of this year, sailing out of the Wusongkou. The collision occurred around midnight. When the red light of the Huatong ship was first spotted, the two ships were about 500 to 600 feet apart. Two whistle warnings were immediately given, but the Huatong did not respond. Therefore, the Zhijiang steered to the right. At the same time, the Zhijiang ship was also equipped with red and green lights, but because the two iron barges towed by the Huatong did not display lights, the collision occurred. After the accident, all passengers on board were rescued. Before the ship sank, he had checked each section and saw that no one was left. The Zhijiang ship began to sink ten minutes after the Huatong left, so there were no passengers in the ship at that time. According to Zhang Jinsheng, the captain of the Huatong, his ship entered the Wusongkou at 0:25 AM on November 18th. The whistle was sounded once at Shigeng Port. Four minutes later, he heard a whistle from the Zhijiang ship. It seemed that the two ships were already very close at that time, and before a response could be made, the accident occurred one minute later. The iron barges were tightly attached to both sides of the ship, which did not violate navigation regulations. He also stated that after the accident, he inspected his ship and found that it was not damaged, so he immediately assisted in rescuing the passengers of the Zhijiang. More than 500 people were rescued by iron barge No. 45, and more than 100 people were rescued by the Huatong ship. Seeing that there were no more passengers on the old Jiang ship, they left immediately. However, according to witness Zhou Gen, he and his three brothers took the Zhijiang ship back to their hometown. The three were separated when the accident occurred. After he was rescued, the whereabouts of his two brothers remain unknown. He also presented a letter from his family as evidence. According to Yang Yi, the service director of the Zhijiang (who was also a survivor), the Zhijiang carried nearly 1,000 passengers, with more than 900 tickets sold. During the collision, the order was chaotic, and dozens of people were injured on the spot. When the Zhijiang ship sank, he estimated that at least twenty or thirty people in the lower levels drowned. Subsequently, the defense lawyers requested bail for their clients. The court ordered that the defendants, Xin Chengfang and Zhang Jinsheng, be respectively entrusted to their respective shipping companies, Gongyi and Tongji, and that two solid merchants be found as guarantors for bail. After the verdict was announced, the families of the victims in the gallery erupted in an uproar, with some shouting loudly. As the trial was over, the bailiffs shouted, "Court adjourned." The two defendants also followed their lawyers out of the court to complete the bail procedures. The audience then gradually withdrew.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhang Yexing, who was accused of serving as the director of the Nanshi Inspection Office of the puppet Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau, was previously sentenced to three years in prison by the High Court. The defendant refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back for retrial. The defendant stated in court yesterday that he was studying at school when Shanghai fell and did not serve as a puppet official. The court ordered that the investigation be postponed and the case be retried.</p>
<h3>Shen Qichang Died of Illness</h3>
<h3>Dr. Zhou Testifies in Court</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Shen Qichang, the puppet inspector and deputy minister of the puppet audit department, died of illness while on bail on December 27th last year during the trial. Because the defendant had many titles, the High Court summoned the defendant's daughter, Shen Zhisi, and Dr. Zhou Yishi yesterday. According to Shen Zhisi, her father's original name was Shen An, courtesy name Huaizhong. He changed his name to Shen Qichang after joining the puppet organization. She also presented a copy of the defendant's identity card in court. Dr. Zhou Yishi testified that the defendant did die of illness.</p>
<h3>Two Journalists from the Enemy and Puppet Period</h3>
<h3>Trial Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Liangbin, who was accused of serving as the head of the shipping department of the enemy's China Shipping Company, the general manager of the puppet National News Agency, a foreign affairs expert of the puppet Central Political Committee, and the director of the puppet Ministry of Construction's Shanghai office, had his case concluded at the High Court yesterday morning. The sentencing is scheduled for the 21st.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Pan Lin Alexander, the White Russian editor of "Russian Voice," repeatedly criticized our country's anti-Japanese national policy during the fall of Shanghai.

The case was concluded at the High Court yesterday morning, and the sentencing is also scheduled for the 21st.</p>
<h3>Reportedly, Materials Were Stolen and Sold</h3>
<h3>Old Case of the Puppet Jianghai Customs Reopened</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 23rd Regiment of the Military Police received a tip that the puppet Jianghai Customs in this city had transferred confiscated military supplies to the Maritime Affairs Section in 1933, and that a large number of military supplies were stolen during the transfer. About a week after the Japanese surrender, a large amount of kerosene stored in the Jianghai Customs warehouse was colluded and sold by a Lin, the head of the Maritime Affairs Section, and a Guan, the head of the Altitude Section. Thousands of boxes were transported away by ship. It was also said that these two matters were related to A.F.S., the British director of the Maritime Affairs Inspection Company, who was temporarily borrowed by the Maritime Affairs Section. After the case was transferred to the District Procuratorate by the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, the District Procuratorate sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs for inquiries. Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs replied, stating that the case had been investigated by the Port Police Bureau. It was discovered that a military supply theft incident did occur at 5:00 PM on September 19th and 9:00 AM on September 20th in 1933. However, very few military supplies were lost, only six pistols and some bullets. On August 17th, 1934, a Japanese man, Lin Ersaburo, transported 1,000 boxes of kerosene from Pudong to another location. On September 21st, 898 boxes of the batch of kerosene were handed over by Guan, the head of the Altitude Section, and the remaining hundred or so boxes could not be recovered. As for A.F.S., he was a former employee of the Jianghai Customs. He was recalled to England during the war, and returned to Chongqing in January 1934 to continue his service. He was sent to Shanghai to handle the takeover when victory came in August 1934. The previous two cases seem to have nothing to do with A.F.S. in terms of time.</p>
<h3>Liu Xun's Retrial</h3>
<h3>Covers His Face and Weeps</h3>
<h3>Says Qian Minxing Made False Accusations</h3>
<h3>Prevaricates About the Origin of the Gold Jewelry</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Liu Xun, the supplementary captain of the third company of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Security Brigade, who had been sentenced to death, was sent back for retrial by the Supreme Court. The High Court brought the defendant to court for trial yesterday afternoon. The defendant had a new haircut, wore a coffee-colored Russian hat, and a gray-brown line flannel cotton robe, speaking with a Hunan accent. He denied all kinds of crimes interrogated in court, claiming that he was originally a soldier of the 62nd National Army Division, and was captured after being injured in battle. He was released on bail by Cheng Wanjun, the commander of the puppet First Division. In November of the 31st year, he was registered in Cheng's department as a lieutenant-level service member. He left after his injury healed. In February of the 32nd year, he opened a cigarette shop in Lianshi Town, Wuxing County. After the puppet security third company came to Lianshi Town, because the captain of the team, He Jianzhang, was from Hunan and was a fellow villager, he sent me to be the deputy captain of the supplementary team, without rank, salary, or duty. Judge Qiu interrogated the defendant strictly about various crimes committed during the time in Lianshi, including rape, looting, and harming human lives. The defendant claimed that the accuser, Qian Minxing, coveted his property and colluded with the township chiefs of the area to make false accusations. He repeatedly claimed to be "we ordinary people" and "we anti-Japanese elements." He covered his face and wept, as if he had endless grievances. Judge Qiu continued to investigate, asking why he did not do business in Lianshi Town, and what was the purpose of sneaking into Shanghai in the spring of the 34th year? Why were there as many as thirteen pairs of gold bracelets and more than ten gold rings found in the defendant's home, and the store names engraved on them were different, such as Tongxiang, Huzhou, and Wuzhen...? Isn't this proof that they were plundered from various places? The defendant claimed that they were his wife's family's belongings, and his answers were evasive. Finally, he asked the court to summon the puppet Zhejiang Governor and Security Commander Chuan Shishuo, who had been sentenced to death, and the puppet captain He Jianqun to testify, and to summon the families of the victims to court for confrontation. The court ordered an investigation and retrial, and the defendant was remanded.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Zang Case Concluded</h3>
<h3>Judge Conducted a Private Visit Under the Guise of a Fake Reporter</h3>
<h3>Witnesses' Statements Were Inconsistent and Immediately Reprimanded</h3>
<h3>Family Members Claimed More Than 100 Million Yuan in Compensation</h3>
<h3>Defendant Said It Would Take a Thousand Years to Repay</h3>
<h3>Court Ordered Sentencing on the 20th</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The re-trial of the Zang Dazier murder case, a suspected instigator of murder, Spanish sailor La Lingnai, was held in the District Court yesterday, and witnesses Zhao Adi, Liao Yuanshou (both rickshaw pullers, the latter testified at the US military court in Qingdao), Jiang Depei, Zheng Shengchu (both employees of the Qundu Ballroom), and family members of the victim, Zang Gensi, Zang Haicheng, etc. were brought to the court to confront La Lingnai. After legal arguments from both sides, the court ordered: "The case will be sentenced on February 20th, La Lingnai will be remanded."</p>
<p>After Judge Wu Ronglin took the seat, he brought La Lingnai and questioned him about his age and origin, then said: The previous trial of this case has exceeded the legal time limit, and the trial should be renewed. After the verdict, the prosecutor pleaded again. Then, the witness Zhao Adi was questioned. He claimed that on September 22 last year, he was waiting for business in front of Huadu, and did not leave until after closing. He did not pay attention when La Lingnai came, but Zang Dazier had asked him to pay attention, saying that a one-eyed foreigner (namely La Lingnai) took a ride without paying. Later, when Lai came out, Zang asked him for the fare. While arguing, a US Tsar suddenly intervened and punched Zang Dazier to the ground. According to Jiang Depei, Lai came to Huadu around eight or nine o'clock. He came alone. He did not know whether he paid the fare, but he said that Lai was indeed drunk when he left.</p>
<p>Zheng Shengchu was called again. Zheng was a worker at Huadu. Judge Wu had visited Huadu under the name of a newspaper reporter and met Zheng Shengchu. At that time, Zheng did not know that Judge Wu was "privately visiting," so he described in detail how La Lingnai instigated the murder and how Loutelik beat Zang Dazier. However, Zheng suddenly denied witnessing the event in court yesterday. He had previously told Judge Wu that La Lingnai and the US Tsar came out of Huadu at the same time, but he also denied it yesterday. He was reprimanded by the court. Finally, Zang Haicheng, the niece of the victim , filed a civil suit, requesting compensation of 8.704 million yuan for Zang's expenses, 134 million yuan for the cost of the deceased's production compensation, and 5 million yuan for the survivor's pension. However, the defendant La Lingnai said in court: He only earns 70 US dollars a month , such a number would take a thousand years to pay off , he is really unable to bear it, and said that he did not instigate murder, so there is no need to pay compensation.</p>

<h3>Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] China and Central Airlines have established relevant international routes. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation approved the revised method of calculating freight rates as follows: For international routes where the origin and destination stations are both outside the country, the freight rate is calculated in US dollars or local currency. For those flying into the country from foreign stations, the freight rate is calculated in US dollars or local currency. For those flying from domestic stations to foreign countries, regardless of distance, the freight rate is calculated in national currency, but it may be appropriately adjusted at any time depending on the situation and the actual reasonable cost of the flight.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor, after reading your newspaper's publication on the 13th regarding a dispute over the sale of gold at our store, there was a slight misunderstanding. On the afternoon of the 12th, Sun, a martial arts actor from the Gong Stage, and two others came to sell gold. They underreported the quantity and tried to force the transaction. The counter staff advised them politely but to no avail. They tried to break into the inner room. Their momentum was fierce and the transaction was not kind. Therefore, our store reported the case to the police and detained Sun and the other two at the Taishan Branch. Although they have been released on bail by the theater authorities, our store reserves the right to negotiate. The above is the factual process. We hereby send a special letter, hoping to publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Yongfeng Silver Shop.</p>
<p>After reading your newspaper's publication on February 7th, "Young Thief Commits Another Crime and Falls into the Net," the contents involved the Arctic Fruit Shop. After checking, Zhu and Li Jun are not personnel of our shop. I hereby write to request a correction. Sincerely, Arctic Fresh Fruit Shop.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Inquiries</h3>
<p>Following the Example of Superiors</p>
<p>Wang Cheng asks: A certain A is doing business outside and has not returned for two years. His wife stole all the public property at home and lived with someone. After A's family discovered this, they invited the local Baojia chief to advise her. She not only ignored it, but also eloped with her lover. As a result, the family affairs are chaotic and no one can handle them. Someone wants to harass a certain woman. To avoid future entanglements, A filed a petition with the local county government to divorce his wife on the grounds of her elopement with someone and malicious abandonment. Is this procedure legal? A certain woman has nominally been a concubine for sixteen years (with a son of thirteen). Due to disagreements, they have been separated for eight years. The concubine has been living with someone for six years. Now I heard that A's wife escaped without a trace, and planned to take the opportunity to please A, and wanted to obtain the position of the principal wife, but A had already made an engagement with someone, so he refused her request. Because her purpose was not achieved, she slandered him. A made a statement in the newspaper to explain all the relationships, and filed a lawsuit with the court to accuse her of defamation. Is this legal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuangling answers] A formal divorce lawsuit should be filed with the county government and requested a judgment. It is not legal to just file a record. There is nothing wrong with publishing and investigating by letter.</p>
<p>Forced Engagement</p>
<p>Zhu Xianzhu asks: During the Anti-Japanese War, I was brought to Shanghai by my parents. After the victory, I returned to my hometown with my parents to sweep the tomb. A few days after returning to my hometown, I was suddenly forced by my parents to get engaged to a man surnamed Zhang. Although I tried my best to oppose it at the time, it did not take effect. May I ask, can I dissolve the engagement if I am under 20 years old? If the other party forces the marriage, will it be effective if I don't attend? If I am forced to marry the other party by my parents using high-pressure tactics in the future, is it illegal for me to leave the family? Is it possible to freely engage with others in the future? If I am found by my parents after leaving home, is it a crime? Is there a proper way to protect freedom without violating the law?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuangling answers] This engagement is legally invalid at all. The engagement cannot be enforced. Moreover, it is an invalid engagement. It is not illegal. You can freely engage in marriage when you are 20 years old. If you are under 20 years old, you should obtain the consent of your legal representative. See the answer in the third paragraph. If you simply do not fulfill this invalid engagement without other illegal acts, you will not violate the law.</p>

<h3>Relaxing Price Negotiations and Smoothing Sources</h3>
<h3>The Situation in the Rice Market Is Improving</h3>
<h3>The Highest Retail Price of White Rice Is Not Allowed to Exceed 130,000</h3>
<h3>Trial Operation for One Week Before Re-Negotiating New Price Limits</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Rice Industry Association believes that the price of rice in the producing areas is high. If the city continues to maintain the highest transaction price of 69,000 yuan and the highest retail price of 76,000 yuan, it will not only be impossible to transport rice to Shanghai, but the entire rice industry will not be able to operate. And if there is no rice to buy from the society, they will generally complain. Yesterday morning, representatives Wan Molin, Qu Zhenhua, Yang Jiuci, Yang Runqin, Yin Fuxiang, Xu Chongren, and other six people were sent to visit Mayor Wu, detailing the various difficulties that the cost was higher than the negotiated price, and sincerely requested that the price negotiation be relaxed so that the rice shops could resume normal operations. After consideration, Mayor Wu immediately verbally ordered that the negotiated price of white japonica rice be 120,000, the market transaction plus a commission of 3,000 yuan, and the highest retail price be 130,000, not to exceed it. This method will be maintained temporarily for one week. We will see how the situation is and want to be able to lower it in the near future.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the food rice market situation gradually improved. The japonica rice, which had not been heard from for a long time, was registered for delivery. According to the Nanshi Market, 796 piculs of white japonica rice, 168 piculs of thin rice, and 90 piculs of early rice arrived, totaling 1,054 piculs. According to the Beishi Market, 904 piculs of white japonica rice, 190 piculs of thin rice, 175 piculs of sheep rice, 95 piculs of Du rice, and 70 piculs of white yuan rice arrived, totaling 1,434 piculs. There were a total of 2,488 piculs in the North and South markets. The number of various gangs coming to Shanghai gradually increased, and people's hearts softened. Many sellers intended to sell, and the retail stores were selling slowly. The trend continued to loosen, and the market continued to weaken by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. However, the transactions were sparse, and the high white japonica rice had retreated to within 130,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market regained its color. Due to the sharp drop, people's hearts were slightly stabilized. The shops added purchases at low prices, and there were rumors of good news, which completely eliminated the exhausted atmosphere. Lilang was the first to have a transaction, with a price of 76,000 yuan, 3,000 to 4,000 yuan higher than the last time. The prices of other flours also increased by about 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran was secretly firm. It was heard that the Relief General Administration had 15,000 piculs open for sale, and speculators tried to buy them at low prices. They deliberately shouted the market price 3,000 to 4,000 yuan lower in the market. Small packages were shouted down to 18,000 to 19,000 yuan, but in reality, small packages were 24,000 to 25,000 yuan and were still difficult to buy. Loose bran was about 34,000 to 35,000 yuan. Only Pudong's net goods of wheat were sold for 73,000 yuan, and the market was firm.</p>
<p>Edible oil</p>
<p>After continuous declines, most of the cargo owners wanted to price increase, it seemed that it had dropped to the limit, but they were still struggling, changing from selling to guarding, and the shouting price rose again. The shops took the opportunity to absorb, and zero sales were still good. The center of the Denggao transaction was still raw oil. The south side gradually retreated. The first opening of raw oil was 240,000 yuan, and the noon closing was 250,000 yuan. The last shouting price of Jitong raw oil was 280,000 yuan, which was about 20,000 yuan better than the previous day. Because there were few transactions of soybean oil, the price was balanced, and the market was also firm. Small carts of sesame oil also rose by 5,000 yuan. Qingma and other oils were still popular.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains</p>
<p>Mostly turned from tired to firm, because the sellers were not as eager as before, and the street gradually had inquiries. The decline in yellow beans was set, and the market returned to peace. The prices of various goods were slightly firm by about 2,000 yuan. The sesame market was similar. After the rapid decline of raw peanuts, there were actual sales, and the price rose by more than 10,000 yuan. Yidou was still peaceful and tired, mung beans were firm, corn was cut by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, red grains were flat, and the bean was firm and then tired, resulting in a slight increase of 500 yuan, and broad beans were balanced.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Flat and Tired</p>
<p>The foreign muscles were firm in the morning and tired in the afternoon, and the situation was vague. The opening in the morning was slightly higher, and the highest at noon. After noon, there were many sales and rapid returns in unfavorable rumors. As a result, Yipi and Guang Paper were slightly higher than the previous closing, steel rose by half a percent, and the rest were flat and slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Idle Funds Seek a Way Out</h3>
<h3>Government Bonds Rise Sharply Again</h3>
<p>There were not many transactions in public bonds yesterday, only 3 million transactions. According to reports, the Legislative Yuan's inquiry to the Ministry of Finance about the interest-buying news, people's hearts were prosperous. Tongbing opened at 2,800 yuan in the morning, and the buying tide surged, rising to a high price of 3,800 yuan to end. As a result, it rose sharply by 1,050 yuan compared to the previous closing. A and B each rose by 500 yuan, D rose by 400 yuan, and E also rose by 450 yuan. Continued to rise after closing.</p>
<h3>Wool Textile and Import and Export Industry Association</h3>
<h3>Please Relax the Import Quota of Wool</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Wool Textile and Import and Export Industry Association of this city held a seat meeting yesterday to discuss the import of wool raw materials. Many people in charge of the two associations attended. After discussion, it was decided to ask the Export Control Committee to relax the import quota of wool raw materials. For the goods that the industry ordered from abroad before November 17th last year, they planned to apply for import permits quickly. Otherwise, the fixed cargo contract will have to be cancelled by the seller, and it will affect the progress of the next ordering procedure.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Wool Textile Industry Association, the monthly raw materials required by each wool textile factory in this city are estimated to be 800,000 pounds of wool tops and 10,000 pounds of wool. The current propaganda by the export management department is that the possible allocation quota is very limited. Due to the lack of raw materials, one-third of the factories have been reduced in size or reduced in work. If there is no hope for the arrival of raw materials in mid-January, then all factories will be forced to stop work or reduce work, so it is necessary to request a relaxation of the import quota. As for the imported raw materials in the future, in principle, they will be allocated according to the equipment of each factory.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Houses Stop Trading; Black Market for Gold and Currency Gradually Dissipates; Gold Price Falls by 950,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The price of gold bullion did not break out of its holding pattern yesterday. In the early morning, it opened at 7.1 million to 7.3 million, and some people took the opportunity to sell at the high price, causing it to fall back to 6.65 million. After that, it went into a holding pattern. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 49 bars at a price of 6.7 million. From then on, it remained in a holding pattern, struggling between 6.7 million and 6.9 million. There was no special change at noon. In the afternoon, the market was still relatively balanced. After 2:00 PM, money exchange houses stopped trading, so forward transactions also came to a standstill. Amidst the urgent rumors, the black market retreated to around 6.2 million. As a result, the closing price was 950,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Gold jewelry was priced at 700,000 yuan, and silver dollars further declined to below 5,000 yuan. As the silver market tightened slightly, interest rates ranged from 15% to 18%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also showed some weakness yesterday. The black market for U.S. dollars opened in the morning fluctuating between 13,500 yuan and 444,000 yuan, and the situation was very sluggish. Rumors of audits of Rong's business and accounting inspections circulated one after another, and money exchange houses stopped trading. Lacking normal trading activity, asking prices were slightly lower. As a result, the closing price was about 3,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Hong Kong currency also fell by 300 yuan. Hong Kong dollar exchange rates had transactions at 2,750 yuan and 3,800 yuan yesterday, with the immediate rate at 3,400 yuan. The British pound exchange rate was 45,000 yuan. All of these had quotes but no market.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Situation Calm</h3>
<p>The silk trend is gradually returning to calm. Yesterday, 120 "Xu" brand bright rayon fluctuated around 6.34 million yuan all day, with little difference from the previous day's price. 75 "Golden Rooster" semi-gloss silk traded at 10.5 million yuan, slightly firmer than the previous day. The "bi jing" (warp-faced satin) was also very quiet. C-grade traded at 7.35 million yuan. Spot prices for "gan jing" (plain silk) remained the same as the previous day. Silk fabrics were also quite stable. Yesterday, besides the Meiya bedspreads and large-checkered crepe de chine being slightly higher, the rest were roughly the same as the previous day's prices. However, transactions were very scarce.</p>
<h3>Paper Imports Difficult</h3>
<p>Inventory Can Last for Six Months</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to a person in charge of the Paper Industry Association: Since the Transport Control Commission placed paper in the second category, paper imports have become very difficult. The paper currently arriving in Shanghai is all from orders placed before November 17th. Applications submitted after November 17th have not yet received import licenses. Therefore, paper prices continue to rise. Newsprint prices were 46,000 yuan before the Lunar New Year, but are now as high as 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, an increase of about two to three times. The prices of other types of paper have also increased similarly. Currently, 90% of the paper used in this city is imported. Although domestically produced paper is cheaper, the production is very small and insufficient to meet demand. Based on current paper inventory, it can last for about six months. If the paper import situation cannot be improved, there is a possibility of a paper shortage in a few months.</p>
<p>Shilin Cloth Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially continued the firm trend of the previous day. Later, because the Textile Construction Company supplied "Dragon Head" fine cloth, and all applicants were able to purchase it, floating accounts from banks sold off, with "Dragon Head" domestic cloth at 167,000 yuan and "Five Blessings" at 164,000 yuan, a decrease of 1,000 yuan from the previous day. However, the high-end 190 Shilin cloth continued to rise by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan because dyeing costs had not decreased.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Still Lingering in a Weak State; Textile Construction Company's List Price Higher Than Market Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the yarn market was still lingering in a weak state. There were still few customers. The price of 20-count yarn continued to fall by about ten thousand. The Textile Construction Company released its list price at 11:00 AM, offering ten types of yarn. The price of 20-count "Water Moon" large package was listed at 3.5 million, but the market price was only 3.4 million. Also, 42-count "Blue Phoenix" was listed at 7.35 million, which was 200,000 higher than the market opening price. Therefore, very few people applied to purchase it. Market sentiment was still weak, and it did not become invigorated by the Textile Construction Company's high listing price. The trend seemed to be entering a holding pattern.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the China Textile Construction Company sold a total of 576 pieces of yarn yesterday. Among them, manufacturers accounted for 473 pieces, and trading houses accounted for 103 pieces. There were a total of 217 applicant households. Among them, manufacturers accounted for 175 households, and trading houses accounted for 42 households.</p>
<h3>Cotton Fabric Reproduction Industry Requests Advance Yarn Allocation</h3>
<p>After the sharp rise in yarn prices, factories in the cotton fabric reproduction industry have been greatly affected. The Reproduction Products Industry Association held a meeting of representatives from affiliated associations to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was decided to request the Textile Control Commission to allocate in advance the cotton yarn purchased by the association from various yarn factories and to improve the allocation method. The submission will be sent out within days.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Spring Sales Progress</h3>
<p>The spring sales of woolen fabrics continue to progress. Local shops and customers are constantly purchasing. However, the transaction volume has decreased compared to the previous days. The reasons are: First, prices have risen sharply since the tariff was increased by 50%. Second, people are afraid to try again due to the pain of high-interest loans. Third, most transactions require cash, making it difficult to issue checks payable in ten days or half a month. Fourth, in general, buyers are carefully assessing their strength and trading according to the principle of "selling when the price is high and buying when the price is low."</p>
<h3>Sixth Sugar Allocation by Taiwan Sugar</h3>

It is understood that the company's approved allocation volume this time is based on one-fourth of the actual total amount of each sugar merchant's allocations in the first, second, third, and fourth allocations as a reference standard, with each unit of coarse granulated sugar given a flexible allocation of ten bags in the above four allocations.</p>
<h3>Pig Bristle Market Chaotic</h3>
<p>The pig bristle market price has recently been stimulated. The price of Shanghai bristles has risen from around 900,000 yuan per picul to 1.8 million yuan. Sichuan bristles have risen from 1.1 million to 2.12 million yuan, an increase of about 100%. In addition, current labor costs are also adjusted according to the cost of living index. The industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude, with few transactions. As for the overseas market, prices have not improved due to the U.S. government's sale of inventory. The price of Sichuan bristles is still fluctuating between 2.5 and 2.6 yuan per pound, while Shanghai bristles are only 2.1 to 2.2 yuan, with quotes but no market. The industry is not daring to export due to the current sharp rise in prices and the chaotic market. Also, before the implementation of the export method through the "Bu Zhong" system, the China Trust Bureau ordered a total of 4,100 piculs of pig bristles from four companies: Zisan, Heyuan, Xianfeng, and Chongde, including 8 piculs of Hankou bristles and the rest were Sichuan bristles. Hankou bristles were priced at 4.5 yuan per pound, and Sichuan bristles were priced at 3.2 yuan per pound.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Firms Again</h3>
<p>The daily increase in tung oil has far exceeded the export limit. According to people in the industry, prices in the tung oil producing areas have been rising. In order to maintain costs, merchants in the Shanghai market have no choice but to raise prices at any moment. Among other vegetable oils, the highest increase is in castor oil, which has reached 500,000 yuan per picul. Yesterday, the market price for tung oil was 3.6 to 3.7 million yuan per picul, and the foothold was very firm. The price of West Hong goods also surged, and the market was extremely short of goods, with each barrel priced at 3.4 million yuan. (Another report) According to a certain merchant, the Shanghai tung oil market price is based on the rise and fall in Hankou, and Hankou tung oil prices are mostly based on the Hong Kong market price. Therefore, regular export prices cannot fully control the entire market.</p>

<p>The daily wage of the ten major industries listed above has increased by an average of 11,728 times.</p>
<p>(Fish Prices Balanced)</p>
<p>Amidst this round of skyrocketing prices, fish prices have remained normal without a sudden surge. According to General Manager Tang of the Fish Market, the supply of fish has been smooth recently. Sales are made as soon as the fish arrive, especially for fish from fishing vessels, which are sold through auction. Daily auctions allow transactions to be concluded at normal and reasonable prices, which is a major stabilizing force. Given the current supply situation, neither cornering nor price gouging is likely to occur in the fish market.</p>
<h3>Announcement by the Transport Control Executive Committee; Slight Changes in Commodity Classification; Import Licenses for Jeeps Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Executive Committee of the Transport Control Commission has recently made slight changes to the commodity classification and hereby announces the following:</p>
<p>According to Article 10 of the Amended Regulations, commodity classification may be changed as needed according to the situation. The attached table reclassification subcommittee, the Tariff Issues Advisory Committee, and the Reception Committee of this committee have resolved that the changes are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) In the attached table, the commodity name in Import Tariff No. 4115, "Tobacco Stems, Tobacco Dust, Broken Tobacco, Waste Tobacco," is merged into Tariff No. 4113.</p>
<p>(B) In the attached table, the "B" transportation oil trucks are listed in the attached table.</p>
<p>(C) The commodity name in Tariff No. 253, "Aircraft and Spring Accessories," is changed to be listed in the attached table.</p>

<p>In addition, the commission will temporarily suspend the issuance of licenses for the import of jeeps, except for those donated by foreigners. The commission will consider and decide whether to allow the import of special types of trucks on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, the commission's Guangzhou office originally had a gasoline import quota of more than 300 tons for the first quarter, which has already been used up, causing a gasoline panic in Guangzhou. The commission has now specially approved the request of the local authorities and allocated the second-quarter quota for emergency relief. At the same time, it will request a thorough investigation of whether there is hoarding.</p>
<h3>British Merchants Need Chen Qimen Black Tea</h3>
<p>Although there were inquiries about both domestic and foreign sales in the tea market yesterday, sellers still held onto their goods in the hopes of a better price, and transactions remained weak. However, the market situation continues to improve. According to news from British export merchants, they are also planning to resume purchasing Qimen black tea from 1946. There is currently a considerable amount of inventory. It is said that the buyer and seller are in negotiations. If an agreement can be reached, the situation will likely improve.</p>
<h3>Coal Supply Scarce; Allocation May Be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to news from the Fuel Control Commission, the Qin Huangdao area has been heavily frozen recently, making coal transportation difficult. It is estimated that only 100,000 tons of coal will arrive in February. Also, because not much coal arrived in the previous two months, coal reserves have been constantly used, and currently only about 60,000 tons remain. Therefore, the allocation of coal in February must be reduced accordingly. The price will be 15,000 yuan per picul higher than last month.</p>
<h3>Municipal Statistics Office Releases Major Financial Price Ratios and Indexes for Last Year</h3>

<h3>China and the United States Ban Copyright Infringement; Translation Remains Unrestricted; Minister Zhu Stated to Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Reporters visited Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua yesterday and asked many questions. Minister Zhu answered them one by one as follows: (1) On the issue of government-funded students, the Ministry of Education stipulated the previous year that funding would not be based on departments but on need. Among new students, 40% are fully government-funded, 40% are half government-funded, and the other 20% receive no funding. In this unstable living situation, those who have already applied will be maintained until graduation. Whether new students can apply again in the second half of the year has not yet been decided, but it is generally intended to maintain the current system.</p>
<p>Textbook Issue</p>
<p>(2) On the issue of nationally standardized textbooks: Because a long time has passed since the last review, the content has become outdated. The Ministry of Education is currently holding meetings to discuss this, hoping that the public will contribute their opinions, which the Ministry of Education will adopt as much as possible. Nationally standardized textbooks were originally printed exclusively by "Seven United," but printing has now been opened up to everyone. The Ministry of Education has set standards for calligraphy, paintings, paper, etc. Samples can be sent to the Ministry for review starting March 1st. Those deemed qualified will be issued licenses. After printing, they can be distributed and sold starting July 1st. (3) Military training for high school students may not be implemented this year. The conscription law stipulates that all citizens must serve for two years. If students receive one year of military training and then have to serve for two years, the time of intellectuals is valuable and should not be wasted. Therefore, it is now planned to integrate military training with the conscription system, stipulating that high school graduates only need to serve for one year to save time.</p>
<p>Guidance System</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the guidance system for colleges and universities, it has been decided that each school will organize a guidance committee, with the president as the chair, the dean of guidance as the secretary, and the deans of other colleges, department heads, and professors who can lead students as members, so that teaching and guidance are integrated. (5) After the signing of the Sino-American treaty, copyright infringement is prohibited, which will certainly affect textbooks used in Chinese universities, but translation remains unrestricted. (6) The Ministry of Education is very concerned about the two beatings of students in Chongqing, but has not yet received a detailed report. It has sent a letter to inquire. In the event of such incidents, anyone who disrupts social order can only be dealt with according to the law. (7) The report that a large number of students at Peking University have suspended their studies is probably not true. I have not received any report related to this matter so far. (8) The issue of providing relief to students who fled from the "Liberated Areas" is currently being handled by the Education Assistance Committee. The committee was originally affiliated with the Youth Corps, then the Executive Yuan, and now it belongs to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Wuhan University Student Protests</p>
<p>(9) The Wuhan University student protests stemmed from a misunderstanding. The second batch of funds for reconstruction issued by the Ministry of Education was intended for the construction of school buildings. The school is still in session, and the students' point of contention is only to request a reduction in the school's punishment for those who caused the first disturbance. However, the punishment is very peaceful and lenient, so it must be carried out. Some students may have been instigated, so they caused a second disturbance, and they will also be punished once they are identified. The Ministry of Education has sent the Director of Higher Education to Wuhan to observe, and President Zhou will also return to the school in Beijing shortly. (10) The 35% of educational funding stipulated in the Constitution will be implemented when the Constitution is implemented. (11) On the issue of party groups withdrawing from schools: The party has probably withdrawn, but this is not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Self-Funded Students in the US Can Apply for Foreign Exchange in the US</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 14th - Central News Agency] The Ministry of Education announced: In order to facilitate self-funded students in the US to apply for foreign exchange, students can submit their admission certificate and transcript or photograph to the Chinese consulates in the US, which will then transfer the application for foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Chinese People Value Children's Education</h3>
<p>New Discovery by Mrs. Cowell of America</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Miami, Florida, 14th] Mrs. Cowell, executive director of the China Relief Committee, who recently returned from China, estimates that about half of China's 200 million children are in school. She found that Chinese parents are very eager to promote their children's education.</p>
<h3>Children's Handicraft and Art Exhibition to Be Held for Three Days Starting June 6th; This Semester's Mandarin Competition Limited to Senior Grades</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The first meeting of the principals of central national schools in Shanghai and the first preparatory meeting for the children's handicraft and art exhibition were held jointly yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Fifth District Elementary School on Yingshi Road. Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau, Director Zhu Junti of the National Education Department, and more than 40 principals and art experts attended. It was decided: (1) The children's handicraft and art exhibition will be held in one place for three days starting June 6th. Each school district will hold a preliminary exhibition in its district from May 11th to 20th. The exhibits will be primarily children's regular schoolwork to ensure authenticity. Handicrafts will be divided into five categories: clothing, food, housing, transportation, and others. Art will be divided into five categories: sketching, free drawing, patterns, collage, and others. (2) The topics for this semester's Mandarin speech competition in each school will be freely chosen and limited to senior grades. Schools without senior grades can have middle grades participate. (3) The investigation of school-age children and out-of-school adults in each district will be handled by the guidance directors of each district in consultation with the district offices and reported.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bank Continues to Offer Education Loans</h3>
<p>Total Amount Set at 200 Million National Currency; Applications Begin on the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>The Municipal Bank of this city, recognizing that public educators and impoverished citizens in this city have difficulty raising the funds necessary for their children's education, has held two education loan programs successively last year, which have been very effective. It has been heard that the bank has been ordered by the municipal government to continue the program as before. The total amount of loans for this period is set at 200 million national currency. The allocation method is as follows: 150 university students, 200,000 yuan per student; 250 high school students, 140,000 yuan per student; 350 junior high school students, 110,000 yuan per student; 1,200 elementary school students, 80,000 yuan per student. The interest rate is 1% per month, limited to six months, and repaid in equal monthly installments, with interest decreasing as principal is repaid. The application period is from the 15th of this month to March 6th, for a total of 20 days.</p>
<h3>Pan Wenzhen Yesterday Received the Press, Denying Assaulting a Teacher</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The disaster-stricken teachers and staff of the Municipal Shaanxi North Road Elementary School hosted members of the local press at the Atlantic Restaurant at 3 p.m. yesterday, denying that the principal had assaulted a teacher after the fire. Zhang Baineng, the school's director of general affairs, presided over the meeting and reported that Chen Suyun was a substitute teacher at the school. He stated that the allegation that Principal Jing Qing was not transparent was a malicious slander, among other things.</p>
<p>Following this, Principal Pan Wenzhen stood up to speak, refuting the points made by Chen Suyun as follows: (1) Regarding the accusation of taking advantage of the fire: Chen Suyun has absolutely no reason to inquire about whether the school has money or not. At the same time, whether something burned down or not has nothing to do with corruption. I have not reported anything to the Education Bureau so far, so what corruption are we talking about? (2) Regarding the two million yuan in relief funds allocated by the Education Bureau, I only affixed my seal of approval for the withdrawal. All distribution methods were handled by the school's colleagues themselves. (3) The fact that teacher Wu Baoqin said that she could not even get a drop of water to wash her feet should not be my responsibility. The school automatically organized a meal group due to extremely tight funds, stipulating that hot water would only be provided during work hours. (4) Chen Suyun's claim that she was my principal must also be denied. When I was studying at Zhejiang Normal School, Chen was only my teacher, not the principal. Moreover, I later served as the principal of that school. So, if I respect her, I acknowledge her as my teacher. Otherwise, I could also say that she taught at my women's normal school. (5) The accusation of misusing private connections is even more inconsistent with the facts. I have always handled matters impartially, without considering personal relationships. The current Director of Academic Affairs of our school, Tian Min, is indeed my own brother, but she is a graduate of Jinan University and has taught for seven years. I ask, is she qualified? Furthermore, Chen Suling is my personal acquaintance. Because of her weak abilities and constant sowing of discord, hindering the school's administration, I disregarded personal feelings and asked her to seek other employment. This alone proves that I do not misuse private connections. (6) You say that the principal should protect the careers of teachers, then I ask: Are all Tom, Dick, and Harrys included in that protection? (7) Regarding the matter of Li beating a teacher, apart from being more serious in my attitude during meetings, speeches, and lectures, I am usually praised as "kind and amiable." The so-called invitation of the masses to beat a teacher is incomprehensible. In reality, after leaving the school, Chen lost all sense of shame and disfigured herself, claiming to have been beaten, in an attempt to frame someone else.</p>
<p>The reception, which had a theatrical air, ended around 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>Private School Subsidy of 500 Million Yuan to Be Allocated as Student Loans for Needy Students</h3>

<h3>Basketball Friendly Match: Shantou Team vs. Columbus</h3>
<p>The basketball league originally had three matches scheduled tonight, including the Group A match between the Shantou team and Enkas. Due to unforeseen circumstances, Enkas was unable to play. With the consent of the Shantou team and the approval of the Basketball Committee, the match was rescheduled.

<p>The first match is the women's group match between the Women's Youth Purple and Women's Youth Red teams, with the sister teams competing against each other.</p>
<p>The second match is the Group B match between the Indian team and the V team. The V team recently suffered a crushing defeat against Jia Shen, which was uncharacteristic. It is difficult to predict the outcome of today's match against the Indian team.</p>
<p>The final friendly match is between the Shantou team and Columbus. This is the first time the foreign Columbus team has appeared in Shanghai. However, it is said that their skills are above those of the Sealand Youth team. Today, the two teams will meet, and it remains to be seen who is stronger. Today's schedule is recorded below:</p>
<p>Women's Youth Purple – Women's Youth Red (Women's Group) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Indian – V Team (Group B) 6:30 PM</p>

<p>— Hong Shen</p>
<p>The annual "Drama Festival" is approaching again. People in the drama circle have decided on some commemorative measures, such as holding commemorative ceremonies, performing spoken dramas, Peking operas, and several types of local operas and variety shows simultaneously. These can only be said to make the festival not seem too deserted, which is still far from the "Drama Festival" full of enthusiasm that we envision.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the spoken drama movement had unprecedented development. Everyone thought that once victory came, the golden age of spoken drama would follow. This dream was finally shattered by cruel reality! In a time when the flames of war raged across the country and countless lives were lost, spoken drama shrunk and declined sharply. If we were to draw a curve to represent this, it should look like this: At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the curve gradually rose. The Battle of Wuhan—the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance—should be the peak of the "rising arc." Afterwards, although it gradually declined, the trend was slow. When victory came, the "falling arc" became very significant. The increased recession last year seemed to have reached the bottom of the "falling arc."</p>
<p>We must have the courage to face the following inevitable difficulties: (1) Due to the continued malignant inflation of currency, the purchasing power of the general public will continue to weaken, especially the audience for spoken drama, who are mostly junior civil servants, students, and intellectuals. They will become even more impoverished, which means that attendance at commercial performances will be even more unreliable; (2) Two theater spaces are still waiting to be fought for and obtained; (3) Hollywood films will invade in an even more aggressive manner and expand their occupation; (4) Raising funds for performance expenses will become even more difficult and affect the quality of performances; (5) The lives of spoken drama actors will become more strained; (6) Due to the difficulty of publication and performance, the output of script creation cannot be increased, which means that the script shortage will not be resolved and may even become more serious…</p>
<p>Of course, these difficulties do not exist in isolation, but are interconnected, adding up and multiplying each other. Weak purchasing power of the audience leads to poor attendance, and the front office is unwilling to continue ordering; the rampant Hollywood movies further increase the economic difficulties of spoken drama, which is already struggling under high-interest loans. Performances cannot help but be simple and crude, and the actors' salaries cannot help but be affected. As a result, playwrights cannot help but give up.</p>
<p>This seems to be the most pessimistic view, but it is also a fact that will inevitably come. We must have the courage to face these difficulties in order to overcome them. I also believe that these difficulties will not only be unique to spoken drama, but will also be shared by Peking opera and local operas.</p>
<p>Today, as we commemorate the Drama Festival, on the one hand, we must stand on the position of the drama circle itself to strive for the development of the drama movement. More importantly, we must lead the people to strive for peace and carry forward the glorious tradition of the spoken drama movement over the past 30 years!</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Drama Festival</h3>
<p>— Lu Si</p>
<p>Was the drama movement in the past year really as "meaningless" as some people say? This is naturally another question. Therefore, on this day of the Drama Festival, I want to specifically raise it and urge everyone involved in the drama movement to conduct a rigorous self-criticism. You need to know that reviewing the past is for planning the future, and settling old scores and using past failures to guide future successes is not entirely meaningless.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, the decline of the drama movement in the past year was certainly greatly affected by the economic recession, but the drama movement itself lacked a clear goal, or rather, the drama lacked a central point, which was also a major reason. Most of the performed plays of various theater groups are used as stepping stones to "commercialize drama." They are testing the fate of drama, seeing which types of plays are easiest to sell. This has to be a fatal wound to the drama movement.</p>
<p>Based on past failures and experiences, if we want to save this year's drama movement, we must first determine its direction, so that our future drama has a central point.</p>
<p>So, what is the central point of drama that we need? In a word: "Strive for national construction and peace!"</p>
<p>During the war, we made our drama serve the War of Resistance; today, we must guide our drama to serve national construction. Now, the civil war is deepening, the national economy is on the verge of total collapse, and the common people are on the line of death. We must make every common person understand the meaning of national construction and stand up together, devoting all their efforts to peace and striving for unity, which is already not enough to break through the current greatest crisis! And for propaganda and education to the common people, the most effective weapon is, as everyone knows, drama; therefore, we must ignite our passion, strengthen our combat power, and ensure that the drama movement and the national movement are tightly linked together, calling on the people of the whole country to unite and work hard!</p>
<p>Waiting for the improvement of objective conditions before engaging in the drama movement again is like waiting for a rabbit to hit a tree, and it is also the most ignorant of the drama movement!</p>
<h3>Characters in Sichuan Shadow Puppets</h3>
<p>Interesting Stories of Writers</p>
<h3>Hugo</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>The French romantic novelist Victor Marie Hugo (1802-1885) was always very casual in life. When he was young, he was once talking about love with Miss Adele Faucher, and Miss Faucher promised to give him twelve passionate kisses. Later, in a letter he wrote to her, he actually wrote: "Dear! Please forgive me, and please allow me to take just one of the twelve passionate kisses you have allowed me!"</p>
<h3>Minor Remarks on the Drama Festival</h3>
<p>— Liu Canglang</p>
<p>Just like a person stranded in a foreign land is afraid of encountering his birthday, I am afraid of our festival. Because when this "happy" day comes, the stranded person cannot forget his home; the person engaged in drama cannot forget his own painful industry—not being able to forget is the greatest pain.</p>
<p>We offer the most laughter to celebrate, but in our hearts, we are choked with sobs.</p>
<p>From "new actors" to "abnormal behavior," from "those who sing spoken drama" to "artist registration," from "social ornaments" to "lacking loyalty, filial piety, and moral integrity"... Art itself and the workers themselves have always been thrown into a very absurd position in this absurd country. During the War of Resistance and the victory, drama and theater people did their best.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance and the victory, those who slandered drama also did their best.</p>
<p>We cannot forget!</p>
<p>From prosperity to decline, from enthusiasm to cooling, from collectivism to selfishness, from sincerity to hypocrisy, from being immersed in art to worshiping gold, from "social value" to "box office value," from living for drama to acting for the sake of living... The test of history is terrible; the result of the test of history is even more terrible. The iron whip of life has swept people off their center of gravity, like spinning tops, spinning rapidly and randomly before falling down.</p>
<p>"People must live on," "Existence is power!"</p>
<p>Under the loud slogans, baseness became nobility, crookedness became uprightness, darkness became light, and wrong became right.</p>
<p>How to live? What method to use to exist?</p>
<p>Whoever asks such questions is an idiot; whoever stubbornly clings to "how" and "what" is a mental patient.</p>
<p>We cannot forget!</p>
<p>On the stage, we are watching a brand new theatrical style being born. It is not a tragedy, not a comedy, neither a farce nor a tragicomedy. It should be called a "play play." A kind of "play play" that is fun to perform and even more fun to watch.</p>
<p>On the stage, we are watching a brand new performance system being born. It is not the Shanghai school, not the Beijing school, neither naturalism nor psychological realism. It should be called the "non-human performance system," using all methods to make the audience feel that there is no "human" feeling at all.</p>
<p>On the stage...</p>
<p>But "existence is power," but "it is a smile with tears," but it is:</p>
<p>Not being able to forget is the greatest happiness.</p>
<p>On this "happy" festival, I have the clearest memory.</p>
<h3>Introspection</h3>
<p>— Chen Baichen</p>
<p>Written for the Fourth Drama Festival</p>
<p>The main significance of commemorating the Drama Festival at this time and place is probably not to showcase ourselves. The achievements of the ten years of the War of Resistance are naturally there, but a hero does not mention his past achievements. In today's low tide of the drama movement, there is no need to revel in the past, but there is even less need to bitterly complain about the current difficulties. The road of the drama movement has always been tough and hard-won. Back then, the Southern National Society performed for the only audience in the theater—a mouse. They never complained. Today, there are still two theaters in Shanghai. Are you still not satisfied? As long as you are moving forward, heading towards the bright path, don't be afraid of failing. So today, introspection is perhaps more important.</p>
<p>I am a playwright, and I can only talk about my own profession. I want to introspect myself.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need to introspect myself today, so I introspected myself once a month or two ago. That was when Mr. Hong Shen, the editor of the "Drama and Film" section of Ta Kung Pao, asked me to write an article, so I wrote one called "A Question." The content of the article was: I think that the current form of drama is too restrictive for writers, especially too restrictive for the audience. The audience has a traditional view of watching plays. Our current form of spoken drama has not been truly accepted by the broad masses. We should look for a more suitable form. Today, I am introspecting myself again, and I feel that I am very stubborn and still insist on my prejudices: The current form of spoken drama is "a question."</p>
<p>What makes me so stubborn are the opinions of several seniors and a gentleman who considers himself a layman. They all said, "Content determines form." They said I was wrong; if your content is accepted by the masses, your form will naturally be accepted!</p>
<p>Whatever kind of content a play has, it will have its own form of expression. This is natural. But, heaven, what I mean by "form" is not this at all! Ibsen wrote "Ghosts" with Norwegian life as its content, and Cao Yu wrote "Thunderstorm" with Chinese life as its content. Does that mean that "Ghosts" is a Norwegian form and "Thunderstorm" is a Chinese form? What is the difference between the forms of "Ghosts" and "Thunderstorm"?</p>
<p>I am clearly saying that we now need a national form, but people are talking to me about content—if you make bread from Chinese flour and tell the farmer that it is called a flatbread, he will still shake his head.</p>
<p>Because I believe that the failure of this form of spoken drama to be accepted by the broad masses is one of the reasons for the decline of drama today, I have provoked a gentleman who calls himself a layman to ridicule me thoroughly. He believes that drama was so prosperous during the War of Resistance, and today's low tide is entirely due to political reasons. He means that I am emphasizing the unimportant and neglecting the important. I have not denied the political reasons, but if everything is attributed to the objective environment and we stand idly by subjectively, I think it is not very right. If politics gets on the right track, will our form of spoken drama be completely accepted by the broad masses—especially the farmers? —In fact, this is already unnecessary to assume, we only hear that farmers welcome the yangko dance, but do not feel interested in spoken drama, is that not enough to illustrate?</p>
<p>Drama cannot leave the audience, everyone knows that. But to talk about the audience and ignore the vast number of farmers is unacceptable. I am very stubborn, I feel that to offer today's form of spoken drama to Chinese farmers is ultimately "a question."</p>
<p>It is very difficult to throw off the baggage of inheritance. I also know that the national form cannot be drawn with one stroke by anyone. Introspecting myself is only to encourage myself. This short article is of course not a defense or anything like that, and it is appropriate to attach a statement.</p>
<h3>Trivial Feelings on the Drama Festival</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>In the past, writing plays was a hobby, but recently I haven't written plays for a long time. In theory, I am not qualified to make random comments on this memorable Drama Festival today, but the editor kindly urged me to write a short article, and I couldn't refuse his kindness. Since I have a connection with drama, I might as well "indulge in elegance" a little bit. What I say may be wrong, and I hope that people in the drama circle will not take offense to the words of an outsider.</p>
<p>I have been associated with drama for ten years, and I can be said to know a little about the situation in the drama circle. There are satisfactory aspects, but there are also regrettable aspects. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the Drama Festival, I would like to offer two points of shallow views that I hope the drama circle will pay special attention to, and I hope that they can be considered.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding plays, no matter what kind of drama is performed, the scope of script selection is very narrow, either limited by sectarianism or limited to the works of professional playwrights of that professional theater group. And these playwrights cannot help but write for performance, or even write for making money (the so-called suitable for business). Their creative attitude is naturally impossible to be strict and serious, and the literary style can be imagined. This phenomenon has been common in recent years. Of course, this is also an inevitable transitional period under the high pressure of the entire economy, but I think this is not an absolutely insurmountable problem. The government's imposition of heavy taxes is also one of the contributing factors. Assuming that Chinese drama needs to make progress and compete with world drama, this is worth noting.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding theater people, on the surface, it is undeniable that theater people have close emotional and career connections and cooperation, but in their hearts, there may still be a considerable distance. This has a serious impact on the drama movement. This is about the attitude that living theater people should have towards living theater people. There is also the respect and remembrance that living theater people should have for dead theater people. Because today's drama can have this foundation, those dead theater people have their respective meritorious contributions, such as Zhu Shuangyun, Zuo Ming, Shen Shuofu, He Mengfu, Shi Chao, and Li Shifang, who recently died in a plane crash. They sacrificed for the War of Resistance, and it can also be said that they sacrificed for drama. After their death, there should not only be a superficial and vain memorial, but there seems to be a particular need for sympathy and assistance to their surviving families. This is not only a comfort to the spirits of the dead, but also an encouragement to the spirits of the living. However, these have been neglected by theater colleagues today, so I often feel chilled for those theater friends who "people die, feelings die"! I hope that the drama circle can pay close attention to this issue and find ways to make concrete expressions.</p>
<p>The above are rough words, written out of feeling. If there are any errors, I am willing to accept criticism.</p>

<h3>Money is Not Omnipotent; Cars Get Hungry Too</h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>These past few days, the entire city of Shanghai has been shaken by the giant waves of soaring prices. Gold is like a horse with a loosened rein, white rice like a boat without mooring. All commodities are running and jumping wildly, rushing forward. Taking white rice alone, in just a few days, it has leapt from seventy thousand-plus to one hundred and forty thousand. Moreover, there is a market but no goods; to buy even a small amount, one must rely on personal connections and plead for favors, running around and exhausting oneself. "The people regard food as heaven," so what else can ordinary people do but tighten their belts?</p>
<p>Coincidentally, amidst the clamor about the rice shortage, Shanghai's cars are also experiencing a "fuel shortage." For days, dozens of cars with rumbling stomachs have been parked at various gas stations, forming a long, snake-like queue, waiting to be fed. Waiting one or two hours, they still can't get their fill, just like citizens waiting for rationed food during the occupied period—a pitiful sight!</p>
<p>Money is omnipotent! Science is omnipotent! The gentry and wealthy merchants of Shanghai, relying on the giant arms of money and science, were fearless. They never imagined that when faced with a shortage, the giant's arms would also fail! Therefore, this recent car fuel crisis seems to provide some enlightenment to Shanghai's gentry and wealthy merchants!</p>
<h3>"Please Help"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>As gold prices soared for days, affecting commodity prices, Mayor Wu, concerned about the people's livelihood, specially convened an emergency meeting at 4:00 PM on the 12th, gathering various trade associations related to daily necessities to discuss ways to curb soaring prices. During the meeting, he repeatedly said, "Everyone, please help. Otherwise, if I have to deal with a few of you, it would be too boring!" (See the 13th issue of this newspaper).</p>
<p>How "polite" and how "humorous" these words are from the mayor! Suppressing prices requires the leaders of various industries to "please help"—this precisely demonstrates the "hard work" of the rulers! But it is also a "painful cry"! However, the mayor also said: "If I have to deal with a few of you, it would be too boring!" These two sentences are just like what Shanghai people call "knowing what to think"!</p>
<p>But based on several past "cases," those with "backing" and "patrons" can still "swagger around" as usual. There's nothing you can do to them!</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, the Mayor also hoped that "everyone should not have their minds full of gold." This sentence truly "hits the nail on the head"! From the high-ranking officials to the common people, who isn't dreaming of gold?</p>
<p>Whether the plea for help will be effective depends on whether you can really "deal with a few of them."</p>
<h3>Truman's Private Life</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Truman doesn't sleep in Lincoln's bed—a prized antique in the White House. He believes it might be considered presumptuous. He has his own bed, and every morning, when Washington is still snoring, he leaves it, full of energy.</p>
<p>He has four White House cars; the one he uses most often is a black Packard called "Mary Queen." He is an impatient traveler, so he prefers to fly in his four-engine G54 plane, "Sacred Cow," rather than take the train. He believes planes can fly in any weather, so last Christmas, despite the wind and snow, he flew back to Missouri to celebrate the holiday.</p>
<p>He sometimes also takes the presidential yacht "Williamsburg" for short trips on the Potomac River. These trips aren't exactly leisurely; he takes some work with him to do on the boat, but it allows him to escape the noisy telephone. Eighty miles from the White House, in Catoctin Mountain, Maryland, there is a rustic, isolated camp built for Roosevelt, called "Shangri-la."</p>
<p>The White House, where the Trumans live, is quieter than it was during President Coolidge's time. Truman rarely invites a prominent family, and there are no social activities. When he has guests at his table, they are mostly relatives visiting him from Missouri.</p>
<p>Truman's large glass and mahogany desk is a model of neatness compared to Roosevelt's cluttered desk. The chair next to Truman's desk is a newly designed one made of metal and blue leather.</p>
<p>On his desk, there is a telephone, a thermos, a small silk American flag, a small wooden donkey, and a small electric clock. His papers are neatly stacked, pressed under a blotter.</p>
<p>Behind the desk, there is a table with some family photos, and behind that is a large window with a view of the waving American flag and the presidential flag.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's stamp collection and tongs have disappeared from Truman's office, replaced by the new owner's collection of early airplane portraits. The room also contains a large glass case containing a model of the battleship "Missouri" and several photos of that battleship, as well as several photos of the battleship "Augusta," which took him to the Potsdam Conference, and three large metal airplane models.</p>

<h3>Telephone Irritability</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>"Hello, where are you calling from?"</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"I'm asking you where are you calling from?"</p>
<p>"You say where are you calling from?"</p>
<p>"I want you to say where are you calling from!"</p>
<p>"Where I'm calling from is none of your business! Bastard!"</p>
<p>"You're the bastard!"</p>
<h3>Manjianghong</h3>
<p>— Pingzhang</p>
<p>Commodity prices soar to the sky, when will the straight-line surge stop? Raising my eyes, I look up to the sky and shout: the "Yellow Peril" threatens! Gold and currency change several times a day, all things closely following the rise and fall; don't idly let the wind of soaring prices pass, only to feel empty and sad!</p>
<p>Black-hearted ghosts are not yet eradicated; when will the hatred of the poor be extinguished? To catch the profiteers, the traces are broken but Shanghai lacks! With lofty aspirations, I will eat the black-hearted flesh when hungry, and laughingly drink the silkworm blood when thirsty; waiting to stabilize great Shanghai from the beginning, the court and the people will rejoice!</p>
<h3>Here and Now</h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>Sacrificing oneself for the country</p>
<p>A "democratic gimmick" of "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling lamb" was staged at the Quangong Building, with excitement on the spot.</p>
<p>Before national goods are promoted, fellow countrymen actually sacrifice themselves for the country!</p>
<p>Free from worldly affairs</p>
<p>Gold ascends to heaven like a Buddha, white rice hides from the world, doing nothing, despite the throwing, pressing, limiting, prohibiting, and making a fuss. One deity, one hermit, free from worldly affairs, leisurely and carefree.</p>
<p>The only culprit</p>
<p>Plane crashes injure people, planes smuggle gold, planes traffic drugs, planes engage in inappropriate acts. A series of social evils are all on the plane.</p>
<p>Today, the plane has almost become China's only culprit!</p>
<p>Philosophical Miscellany</p>
<h3>Cup</h3>
<p>— Wu Hong</p>
<p>In the same cup, one can taste different flavors: sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, or salty.</p>
<h3>Key</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>It is not valuable in itself, but many valuable things are tied to it. Even if you feel tired, you can't leave it for a moment, you must always carry it with you. And the more types, the better.</p>
<h3>Diamond</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>It thought it could show itself off in front of others, but people used it to show off their status.</p>
<h3>Theater Ticket</h3>
<p>— Xing Yi</p>
<p>Poor thing. When people enjoy entertainment, it is torn apart.</p>
<h3>Spring Morning Window (4)</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>Forgetting Knowledge</p>
<p>A law student complained, he opposed the diploma system. Little does he know that only a diploma is a legitimate qualification.</p>
<p>Since he studies law, he has forgotten the most important knowledge in law, the crystallization of this knowledge is four words: "no legal basis".</p>
<p>I think he will never be outstanding when he graduates in the future.</p>
<p>Looking at the Invoice</p>
<p>For example, you buy a bottle of Remy Martin VSOP (whether this bottle of wine is good is another question), pay the money, and take back an invoice. The market price is different morning and night. Apart from this invoice, it is quite difficult to say its price.</p>
<p>A diploma is also like an invoice, stating how much youth and money you have paid (whether what is in your stomach is good Remy Martin is another question). What do you think? Do you think entering school to get a diploma is not a transaction?</p>
<p>Marathon</p>
<p>It's like a strange sports meeting: at the end of a 1,500-meter race there is a line. The athletes are exhausted and almost about to touch it, but suddenly it moves away, moving to 10,000 meters. So the athletes have to desperately rush forward again. Before rushing even halfway, it is suddenly announced that this race is a marathon.</p>
<p>This is the current price of goods, and we athletes can only faint on the spot and end it.</p>
<p>Changing Quality</p>
<p>Commodity prices are soaring, and expenditures are increasing sharply. But there is a good way to maintain the original expenditure amount.</p>
<p>For example, when the price of rice is 50,000, you spend 50,000 yuan to eat a dan of rice. When it is 100,000, you can buy five dou; when it is 200,000, you can buy two and a half dou to eat. And you always maintain an expenditure amount of 50,000. Or, you originally ate white rice, and as the price of rice soars all the way, you can change to eating second-grade white rice, good brown rice, second-grade brown rice—even chaff. Expenditures always remain the same.</p>
<p>But the Social Bureau is very helpful, and the cost of living index always increases every month, although not necessarily too much. If you are paying new based on the index, and living as above, it will be very cheap. Wouldn't your income increase sharply?</p>
