<h3>馬歇爾務卿宣佈草擬長期援華計劃　美衆院外會通過六千萬元援華案　下月一日正式提出國會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕美衆院外委會通過六千萬美元援華包括於援外法案內以後，國務卿馬歇爾同時發表聲明，謂渠正準備草擬一項長期援華計瀏。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛噸廿五日電〕美衆院外委會，本日暫行通過五億四千九百萬美元之臨時援助法案一件，內包括對中國之援助六千萬美元，國務院五億九千七百萬美元之法案，經委員會减少四千八百萬元，對法，奧，義援助已　減少，對華六千萬美元則已通過。委員會本日減少國務院要求，並將我國包括於臨時援助計劃之行動，在全國法案正式修正通過並提交國會前，尙須經委員會最後通過，據委員會人員稱：該法案將於十二月一日向國會提出，修芷後之法案，雖須經最後通過，但委會必將按照今日所通過之修正案實無疑問。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕衆議員周以德，廿五日繼馬歇爾請求對對三國予以五億九千七百萬援助，而議會予以减削一億零八百萬後，提出一項修正。馬歇爾此項請求，在交與衆院外委會錄事以後，即經加以修改爲五億四千九百萬美元之援助四國基金，其中包括中國在內。周以德稱：談委員會認爲，如援助竟欲允許者，則其自應在最有利之條伴及僅可能迅速下實行之。渠稱：馬歇爾會經暗示渠之援華計劃在一月前將準備完竣，委員會認爲，臨時援助計劃包括巾國在内，則在馬歇爾計劃完竣之時，國務院即可即用基金，不再　誤矣。渠稱：對於中國購買物資案，其項目並不加以特別規定，但渠獲悉，中國之最大需要，係爲石油，棉花及類似之物產，而非食糧，周以德稱：關於渠之中國問題修正案，渠尙未與參院其他職員談及，但渠指出，參院　長范登堡廿四日曾謂，渠主張援華，觀察家猶憶及廿四日參職員摩斯會在參院議塲上發表演說，主張援西歐以同一基礎援助中國。周以德稱：之修正案，將爲兩院通過，不但具有希望，並且具有充分自信，該案規定復興金融公司，在該項措施通過後立即預支一億美元。衆院外委會發言人衆職員伏里斯稱：對法，義，奥費用之减削，係根據國因外可動用之基金之數字而减削，同時，參院之擁護該案者，日在增加中，參院議長范登堡預測，廿六日夜將以壓倒多數通過。伏里斯稱：衆院案並未特別規定各國援助之數量，但渠稱：由委員會所發表之演說及報吿觀之，業已闡明國會將如何支配此項基金。</p>
<p>〔又電〕衆議員周以德稱：美集中一切防共力量於歐州，而忽視中國，實　錯誤者。渠稱：實際上，以較少基金，能在中國完成較歐更多之任務。渠繼稱：在防止蘇聯稱霸世界之運動，有兩戰線，即歐洲與亞洲之職綫是也。周以德稱：「吾人現在犯有錯誤，即在一戰綫上，分配二百億美元，而在作同一戰爭另一戰綫上之人民，則不予一文」。</p>
<h3>首都美方權威人士　論經濟援華目標　軍事援助亦僅時間問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕此間美方權威人士語記者，美政府正徇民意之要求，進行援華。馬歇爾於十日宣布援華之保證及款項之約數後，朝野均無反對意見，美參衆兩院重要人士，且多所督促，共和黨有力人士並擬以援華不力攻擊民主黨，故援華之行動，已屆水到渠成，可望於短期問獲得立法根據後具體展開。惟馬歇爾國務卿主張之重點似仍在中國政府控制區之經濟與社會之穩定，馬氏認爲安定之後方，爲獲致前綫車事勝利之絕對要件，而後方安定則必由物資充沛與貨幣穩定方得確保。該人士謂：馬歇爾現仍相信，國軍之優良裝備，不致爲共軍超過，而認安定後方爲援華之要圖，已宣布之三億美元貸款，雙方同意作穩定貨幣之用，其第一期六千萬元之紫急撥付，則顯爲應付年尾物價波動工具之一部。馬歇爾之經濟援華計制，第一目標即爲使法幣價値不繼續貶落，則中國財政困難可有解決之望。第二目標則爲使經濟勿爲財政所累，更藉國外物資之接濟，傳人民生活與心理安定，若然，則前方士氣大振，政治力量可確保軍事勝利，共軍必日幕途窮，無能爲力，和平樞機，始可再現。該人士稱：渠未開軍事援華有何大規模行動，但將來如何則不便推測，蓋此亦客觀事實需要，僅時間問題也。</p>
<h3>改革幣制　需四億美元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電}經濟專家全經會委員黃元彬，評美衆院外委會通過之對外臨時援助法案稱：該法案內容如何，電訊語焉不詳，未能盡知，然依照美援歐動向推測，此六千萬元援華貸款，距吾人之想像甚遠，對解決我國目前經濟危機毫無補益，目前我經濟情形必自改革幣制，以求穩定。而改革幣制所需，除政府現有之外匯頭寸外，尙須四億美元之信用始能完成。</p>
<h3>樓桐孫談援華問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕經濟權威人士樓桐孫稱：美衆院外會通過六千萬美元援華案，吾人希望此乃馬歇爾廣泛援華計劃全部巾之一部份的開端，吾人對此種援助，自表歡迎，唯美國朋友如眞正援助中國解決經濟問翻，即希望能繼續予以援助，因此六千萬美元乃至三億美元，自不無小補，但對眞正解決我經濟問題，距離仍甚遠。同時，樓氏認爲馬歇爾之援華計劃較爲另碎，渠尤深恐此六千萬美元不能一次付給。旋記者詢以對改革幣制問題之意見，樓氏稱：目前似尙談不到改革幣制，除非三億美元能一次付給。樓氏並稱：中國如不依靠外援，中國經濟決不至崩潰，因我國乃農業經濟社會也。</p>
<h3>處理救濟物資委員會今成立</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕政院處理美國救濟物資委員會主委繆嘉銘及該會委員兼主任秘書顧毓瑔，廿六日曾與美方代表吉爾派屈克及摩德二氏作初次晤談，就執行巾美救濟協定規定事項各方面廣泛交換意見，精果極爲圓滿，處委會定廿六日正式成立，美方是否於使館機構中成立一特別小組專司其事，則尙待華府決定。繆氏表示，在中國政府方面，渠將負責處理業務，盡量發揮物資之效用。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本恐怖勢力復活</h3>
<p>最近外國通信社，不斷播送日本恐怖勢力地下活動的消息。據本月九日新亞社柬京電，投降後銷聲匿跡之右翼份子，近有死灰復燃之勢，共中以「革命菊撫同志會」，「新銳大衆黨」，「日本革新黨」最著名。彼輩以「保皇反共民主」爲口號，集合舊軍人地主流氓，企圖造成恐怖。正當這個消息公佈不八，東京盟總獲悉日本現有一種恐怖組織，較前黑龍會更危險更普遍地存在地下，佔領當局有稱之爲「秘密政府」，並信和約簽訂佔領軍撤退以後，若此一「政府」仍未剷除，則將起而奪取政權。據悉此一全國性地下組織，有一爲首之人，及十至十二人組織之委員會，包括前軍閥財閥巨頭，凡同情極端國家主義者，如店主小販擦鞋者，暨士豪流氓勞工煽動者，均爲此一組織構成份子。彼輩有經費有軍火，凡參加者要經過滴血宣誓，充分具有武士道的作風。盟總方面相當注意這事態，但盟總准備如何處置，就不得而知了。</p>
<p>盟總管制日本已兩年多，政治經濟表現極度的不安。反動的保守的勢力，日益增長；比較進步的片山政權，却在搖搖欲墜。無疑地這是盟總縱容舊勢力，未能貫澈波茨坦宣言，和遠束委員會決議，阻止幷摧毁日本軍國主義的錯誤。依照波茨坦宣言。必須澈底「懲罰及日本的侵略」，凡「製造戰爭」的財閥，及其「可以使其重新武裝作戰」之社會經濟體系，必須解散；「妄欲征服世界之威權與勢力」，及「窮兵黷武主義」，卽軍閥機構與法西斯勢力必須根除；發動及主持侵略的「戰罪人犯」，亦須懲處；遠東委員會爲了監督日本投降條款的履行，爲了淸算日本帝國主義復活的基礎，曾多次決議訓令麥帥執行。實際上這些措施從未澈底實施；相反的，恐怖的比黑龍會更危險的組織，今天却在佔領軍管制下出現了。這對於盟國是一重威脅，對於日本和平，民主的前途，是一重恐懼。</p>
<p>今天潛在日本地下的恐怖組織，據路透社的報道，係以舊軍閥及財閥爲中堅。日本的舊軍閥，投降前以法西斯份子爲中心，深入軍隊和農村，於投降援一度銷聲匿跡，由於年來盟總懲罰侵略的忽視，解散法西斯組織的不澈底，戰罪人犯和財閥組織，均感謝盟總的「恩惠」，所以先前的極端國家主義，都以新的姿態復活起來。據我們所知，日本現除有「革命菊撫同志會」等，以南朝忠臣楠正成之菊水垂訓，鼓吹尊皇思想外，尙有神兵隊，大東塾等非法組織，彼輩極力蹬明日本是爲「神意」而戰，和由他們在「大東亞戰爭」的失敗，帶給了天皇的「恥辱」：所以他們要組織行動，以準備下一次的復仇。此種宣傳活動，不止存在於農村和街頭，在北海道更有顯殊公開的發展。彼輩對於戰敗的錯誤，不但沒有覺醒，却在地下磨礦錄鋩，準備於和約簽訂後，再重步入歷史的錯誤的道路。此實爲日本未來的隱憂，爲了建立日本和平民主的前途，我們希望盟總整肅日本民問非法組織，澈底根除一切恐怖勢　。</p>
<p>遠東委員會十一國代表，今年六月制定的「對日基本政策」，曾說國際的安全與安定，端賴下列各項：第一，完全摧毁日本之軍事機構，因此機構爲其數十年來實行侵略之主要手段；第二，設置政治經濟諸條件，使日本之軍國主義不能復活：第三，使日本人民澈底瞭解其戰爭意志，征　計劃，以及達成此種計劃之方法，已使彼等瀕於毁滅。因此各代表決議：全部解除軍備，改組經濟，以剝奪日本作戰之力量：消滅軍國主義之勢力，嚴厲審判戰犯，幷規定一嚴格管制之時期。無疑的，遠束委員會的共同決定，是正確的合理的管制方策，而盟總迄未完全達成任務。美國現正倡議遠東委員會國家舉行對日和約預備會，事實上管制方策與各代表決議尙有距離，盟總幷未使日本遵守投降條款之義務，放棄軍國主義思想與行動，又怎樣能商談和約的內容呢？因此，我們要求盟總務必貫澈波茨坦宣言的條款，執行遠東委員會的決議，纔能爲對日和會奠立順利的某礎。今天日本地下存在的恐怖組織，爲未來對日和約的威脅；唯有消滅軍國主義之勢力，嚴厲審判戰犯，解除日本經濟上思想上的武裝，纔能使對日和會順利成功。當前的時機很迫切，希望盟總有所抉擇！</p>

<h3>魯境國軍鹵獲重要文件　共匪幹部一封信　對上級坦述軍心已渙散</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南航訊〕這衷是被共匪　爲國軍五大主力之一的邱淸泉部在魯西南鄆城附近作戰時，所鹵獲大批文件中最有價值的以件。它是共匪第三縱隊政治指導員汪大年致中共山東分局宣傳部部長陳沂的一封坦述共匪近狀的信，讀者讀完了這封信後，當不難對共匪的「失敗情結」，「保命思想「；「逃亡　隊」；「打不死跑死，跑不死餓死」；和「反攻反攻，丟了山凍」，獲得一全面的了解，深刻的認識，以下即為該信的要點：陳部長：</p>
<p>…二個多月看不到報紙，收不到電訊，從隊也天天在移動，最多只能零碎的收一點，　關在鼓裏一樣的沉悶。偶然那個縱隊送來一張電訊，就如獲至實。到現在還是收不到報紙，電訊還是可以收到一些，但是油墨紙張奇缺，到處買不到。賴少奇同志寫給唐主任要點油墨，店主任說：我已沒法，不能呌我變出來，結果賴親自到政治部，把半　油墨分去了，弄得我們自已印東西也非常困難。</p>
<p>這裏還有個大問題，就是糧食困難。我們經常只吃兩頓，但吃不到飯，能吃到高糧小米，就是好的，（記者按：新四軍幹部大多是南方人。）幸而現在大家對高糧小米也吃慣了，但部隊衷的幹部戰士，就免不了有些「怪話」。</p>
<p>在日常生活上，就是行軍多，到處是水，不小心就得掉下去，特別是單縣的東北地方，一趟就是七八里，至少二三里，沒有一個不　脚的，我騎馬的也　。　邦　得腫起來了，不能定路，口軍跟跡尾迫，不走更不行，現在比較淺一些，天已大晴，大槪再過他半個月，也或許就好了。紙烟肥皂等日用品根本買不到，但是梨子和　到吃飽了。</p>
<p>……收集了大批敵人的宣傳品，可惜過河，濕水磨壞了，到現在只剩幾張。這宣傳品的內容果然荒唐，但人家確也把握住了我們不少的弱點，這却值得我們警惕的，其形式倒是很好，値得我們學習，以打破老一套的形式。</p>
<p>拉得不少了！現在把我所了解的部隊情况，簡要向你報吿一下：</p>
<p>部隊减員數：三縱隊從魯中出發，到濟寗戰鬥後，共計减員六千人，濟寗戰鬥共傷亡五三四四人，全縱隊非戰鬥員减七○○人，共計六○四四人，四縱隊條縱南到黨魯豫軍區（八月十九統計）共减員六一八三人。（缺縱直及十師）。十縱隊從魯中到　魯豫後，統計逃亡的就有二千人，因此汶上就沒有怎樣的攻？以後我們實在無法阻止口軍第五軍主力過運河。據說一縱驗减員的情形更嚴重，現在部隊正進行繼續，三縱隊七九兩　均編成二個團，四縱隊縮編了九　　，縮了一些排，只有八　隊元氣不損，但是他們不顧打仗，光會到處發洋財。</p>
<p>思想狀况：三縱隊自濟寗戰鬥後，普遍的產生了失敗情緒，因爲五個連進去沒出來，幾乎有九個連全部傷亡了，戰後具體的反應有四種；</p>
<p>一，埋怨：上下左右，普遍埋怨，最高的埋怨陳軍長，犯了主觀主義，團級幹部說：「這次很好的殲減仗，可惜上級沒有掌糧好，怪不得團以下幹部。下面埋怨是普遍的怨榴彈砲不來，怨指揮不好，怨丟了彩號（按指傷兵）死屍，怨別人動作不積極，配合不好；八九師互相埋怨，怨政工人員吹牛屁，因動員時說只要包圍上一定打的開，城衷只有口軍的七十二師殘部，最多不過兩個團，只有三門砲，一門還是打不呌的，都是嚕嚕喋喋的殘兵敗將；但是埋怨中也發現了不少的準確的意見，値得領導者的參考。（未完）</p>

<h3>四外長商定議題　討論次序尚待繼續折衝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播，今日外長會議於格林威治時間下午三點三十分舉行第二次會議，東西國家對於奥國問題之意見分歧，可能迅速獲致妥協。此次會議時間預定以三小時爲限。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿六日電〕晚報悉：蘇外長莫洛托夫將在外長會議中，提出一關於對奥和約之「討價」建議。據該報外交記者稱，僉信莫洛托夫可同意以奥國問題爲第一項議程，如能立即通過外長會，將繼而討論草擬對德和約程序問題。今日中午馬歇爾赴邱吉爾私邸與邱翁共餐。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕四國外長今日會議三小時，商定六項議程，但討論次序尙未決定。六項議程如下：　對奥和約委員會之報吿；　德國臨時政治機構之形式與範圍；　德經濟統一之原則；　德國之疆界及制定和約之手續程序；　四十年防德公約即所謂貝爾納斯條約；　莫斯科會議關於解除武裝案之實施。第五項列入議程，爲美國之勝利，第六項之列入爲蘇聯之勝利。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕四外長今日在開幕會議中，商定議程六項，但對於奧國或德國問題孰先討論一層，依舊成三對一之分裂形勢。美英法商請蘇外長莫洛托夫首先討論奥國問題，以便迅速成立協議，安慰焦慮之世界。美國務卿馬歇爾稱，「吾人迅速決定，以安慰全世界人民，極爲重要。」惟莫洛托夫仍堅持德國問題更爲重要，應先討論。法外長皮杜爾提出折衷辦法，主張於議程上規定先討論奥國問題，實際上則略加討論後，即將其移交外長代表，外長會議本身則進而討論德國問題，莫洛托夫仍表示反對。貝文於是提出質問曰，「吾人對於德國問題如不能成立協議，則對於奥國亦不再訂和約乎，吾人必須言明動機何在。」莫洛托夫對於美國主張四國訂約共同監視德國解除武裝四十年一事，則允討論，惟同時須討論西方各國解除德國武裝政策失敗一事。</p>

<h3>敵僞時期　零陵大刼殺案　天亮了匪魁唐楚望落綱</h3>
<p>「本報衡陽廿一日訊」民國三十三年二月，敵人爲了企圖打通大陸交通，發動湘桂戰事，六月間慶開了衡陽保衛戰，八月八日攻陷了衛陽後，跟蹤南進，湘桂路沿綫大小城池相繼淪陷，湘南重鎭的零陸也在九月初淪人敵手，就在這時，人民一面在逃避敵人的槍刺，一面又遭受着匪徒的刦殺。零陵的大刦殺案，就在這個黑暗時期演出了。</p>
<p>僻鄕擁資匪徒垂涎</p>
<p>大刦殺受害人蔣學存，是零陸的一個老實商人，有子蔣　，蔣春，蔣靑，蔣敏，婿周石林，於零陸縣城正大街集資開設文化大華兩紙張文具店，及湘永石印局有年，業務發達，頗有積蓄。三十二年蔣蔚任後興銀行材料官理員，辦事謹愼，深爲行方所信賴，由是聲艱東隆。當日寇發動攻勢之初，蔣蘆於零屬大孝鄕之陶家　放北冲預建棚廠，以爲疏散貨物及銀行材料之用，迨長衡相繼淪陷，所有文化，大華，湘永各店貨物及復興銀行村料，行員眷屬，行李等，悉疏散棚廠及附近鵝蛋漕住宅内，掘窰埋藏。九月六日零陵陷敵，蔣周兩家皆逃避於放北冲棚廠內。此處較爲偏僻，敵蹤不到，以爲極爲安全，殊不知僻鄕擁資，竟遭受了歹徒們的毒害。</p>
<p>唐匪施毒火燒棚廠</p>
<p>蔣家擁資旣鉅，不免爲人所垂涎。會有大孝鄉鄕長胡邵侯，縣府軍事指導員唐楚望，第八保巡邏隊長王瑤，鄕大隊附蔣使，鄉幹事唐獻深，張曉南等，憑恃其特殊勢力，旣有政治力量作掩護，又有武力作後盾，經共同商決，於九月二十日拂曉，由唐楚望，王瑤率領人槍數卞，並經機槍一挺，分兩路馳赴放北冲包圍棚廠，當將蔣學存及其三子蔣靑擄獲，用繩索綑綁，棚內所有行李，金飾，法幣等項，概行刦掠，其未能刦去者，即縱火連同棚廠一併燒毁。</p>
<p>狹路相逢格鬥而死</p>
<p>當時蔣蔚，蔣春，蔣敏，周石林，均因事外出，午後歸來，行抵板靈廟地方，適値唐楚望等刦擄出山，狹路相逢，蔣蔚等憤激之餘，乃與唐匪格鬥，衆寡懸殊，蔣蔚及周石林當塲擊斃，蔣春，蔣敏，受傷被擄。次日，唐復派人將蔣春槍斃。嗣後，又陸續將鵝蛋漕埋贜之貨物，悉行刦奪。蔣學存與子蔣靑被擄至黃江源廟門口地方，綁禁暗室，脚鐐手銬，日以槍斃相恫嚇，結果勒贖銀洋八萬元，又勒去撫慰衝突時被擊斃匪兵劉建明國幣四萬元，草鞋費數萬元，此外，復勒索猪肉，酒，鷄，鴨等項，以爲釋放禮物，方獲脫離虎口。總計唐等刦掠所得，以當時幣値計算，數在百億元以上，誠爲空前之大刦殺案。</p>
<p>石沉大海奇冤未雪</p>
<p>唐匪等之組織，初爲大孝鄕公所，旋改爲自衛隊，再改爲聯鄉大隊，最後又自稱零陵指揮部，唐自稱指揮官，王瑤副之，胡邵侯爲聯鄉辦事處主任，唐獻深爲軍需主任，張曉南爲軍法官，蔣倓爲大隊長，蔣學存被釋後，僦居深山，以當時淪陷未復，該鄕全爲唐匪天下，不僅無法伸訴，即其生命亦時刻有受害之危險。因是，此無法無天之大刦殺案，一直如石沉大海，無法伸寃。</p>
<p>重光以後請求伸雪</p>
<p>三十四年八月，國土重光，政治漸人正常狀態，唐匪等組織解體，蔣學存始回城出面，分基第七區專署及零陵縣府，零陵地方法院，諧求昭雪。但唐匪等其時均以「地下工作」身份，遠走高飛，唐楚望入首都中訓團軍官隊，王瑤人南獄軍官第四中隊，以軍籍作護符，張曉南且公然入零陵縣府供職財政科科員。經蔣學存一再控訴，此一干人犯，僅胡邵侯一人獲案法辦，科處有期徒刑十三年。</p>
<p>悄然歸來惡魔成擒</p>
<p>蔣學存以唐匪等始終逍遙法外，心有不甘，經一再控訴，唐匪終於在京撤職查辦。事實上，這不過是撤了職就完了，所以唐還是一個自由之身。唐以無官可做，乃於上月悄然歸來，經被害人偵得唐之行蹤，具狀地院，於本月八日將唐拘捕。此一殺人魔王，作惡萬　之匪魁，雖倖逃法鋼達三年之久，終於落綱。　聞其他要犯王瑤，由軍官隊退役後，現供職漢口市立醫院，唐獻深與蔣倓等，則已不知所在，正在偵緝中。（特派員黃潮如）</p>

<h3>從敎授的立場　談談「罷課」（續）（完）</h3>
<p>— 彬彬</p>
<p>再把所閱歷的「罷課」風光說說：每次罷課，是由學生自治會議決，便「令出惟行」。開會有時在深夜，有時在上午，有時在下午。若是深夜議決，則次晨各敎授到校時，各課室寂然無人，徒勞往返，若在上午開會，則會塲上人滿，敎室裏空空，敎授們在休息室等候，有些聰明的明知議決必罷，下午一定無課，先見機而去，有些「迂哉夫子」，還在等候「命令」。如下午開會，則不待議決，當天的功課，亦當然上不成，敎室中早已無人了。</p>
<p>學校管不著，學生又不通知，敎授們徬徨了！</p>
<p>議決罷課日期，或一日，三日，七日，十日，多少無定，至復課時，亦無人通知，敎授們在家裏只好隨時用電話向校中打聽，家無電話者，少不得親身到校撲空幾次。因爲學校辦事人認爲這是他們職務以外的事，一槪不管，而學生之罷課復課，只顧他們自己一面，並無正式手續通知敎授。</p>
<p>每次議決罷課之後，有時寫一似「短啓」又似「便條」送致敎員室。雖稱「老師」或「先生」，而內容則儼如命令，（有時並此短信而無之，只向工友們口頭傳說一二語），於於復課，只貼標語，別無手續，則敎授們各在本宅，（因罷課故不到校），學生會旣不派人分向各敎授私宅知會，敎授們亦不能老遠的跑到學校裏去打聽。只等報紙上登出了新聞，　知道復課了。一個大門裏師生間的事，要借重報紙上的敎育新聞版，互通消息，豈非奇事！</p>
<p>學校的敎務處，及訓導處的人員，對於罷課無能干涉，自然亦不過問，更不能爲學生會負通知敎授們的義務。差役們則照章聽命於學校，不能聽命於學生，所以學生雖然罷課，課堂雖然空空，那摇鈴的打鐘的工友仍然依照課程表上下堂的時間，打鐘（上）搖鈴（下），「我行我素」，所以儘管校內寂靜無人，牆外的鄰家聽得鐘聲鈴聲，還以爲這個學校是在按時上課。恍如野寺荒郊，冷冷淸梵，一一報時，亦是異景。</p>
<p>我曾與一個學生作私人談話式說，我們當敎員的上課或放假，向例以敎務處之功課表及通知書爲憑，現在却多了一個「自治會」，但敎務處遇停課放假，必先兩天派信差到各敎授家送信，以免空跑，此乃一定之理，而「學生會」即便是上司，亦應有個事前事後的辦法，即使敎授應當服從學生，試問如何而從？如何而服？那個學生一笑了說：麻麻胡胡，一切作如此觀吧！</p>

<h3>中央銀行行撥款三百億　搶購蘇北墾區棉花　由中國農民銀行負責收購　蘇北棉產約在百萬担以上</h3>
<p>政府為搶購蘇北棉花，特由中央銀行撥款三百億元，交由中國農民銀行代為收購。農行協理趙葆荃，信旗部經理　純　，土地金融處長王通，農貨處副處長歐陽萍，業務處長周紀曜等，特於本月二十三日聯袂馳赴南通及三餘鎭等處實地視察，二十五日已返滬轉京。據悉：此次農行奉命搶購，先從三餘鎭墾區入手。蘇北墾區，因共匪之騷擾，壯丁多被征去，棉花無人採收，猶緊於棉枝上。農行現已委託南通大生紗廠，及蘇北各樂墾公司，代辦收購事宜，並組採花隊，採收棉枝上之棉花，代農民保管。業已收得之棉花，即照數交農行點收。蘇北本年棉產，約在一百萬擔以上。品質極優，且無摻雜情事。每担當地市價，在四百萬元左右不等。政府此次撥交資金，雖為數有限，但可循環應用，初步估計，可產一萬担。</p>
<p>又農行對於蘇北墾區之土地金融，亦擬加以改革。此次視察後，將訂一具體方案，聞將以扶持自拼農為目的。</p>
<h3>華股高峯迭見：臨收賣多疲軟</h3>
<p>華股昨起仆飄忽，風浪險惡，大戶為所欲為，塲外對敲，出手騖人，圈外黑市之狂躍，中途熱股均見新高價，能某猛斬臨收疲而恍惚。</p>
<p>晨開仍難振作，現遞水紗呈倒掛局面，即交以四○四元，遞交以四○○元登塲，開後遞交自四○四元起，七六號等脫手而跌至即交三九四元，遞交三九五元低價。一四八號等咸納回升至四○○元外。是時成交不多，塲外息價開高至二角四及二角八分半，尙難見秀。迨夫港中電一再報縮，業外黑市又跳，外股飛躍，塲外喊價始終高過塲內五六元，人心步好，廣幫二○二號，空方集團一四八號力購不已，一五四號等分別爭納現遞，近午竟漲到即交四四○元，遞交四四二元新高價，而復以四三八元及四四一元之價收收市。熟股中以小型股新光景福及美亞最見俏利，結果梭前收放計即交股永紗信和華總勤興中法內衣中泥國貨各升半成，華新聞北永公新華榮想微升，中興中紡景綸尙平，新亞大通統益微挫。遞交股計美亞景福升一成，新光勤興信和永紗漲半成，華豐小升。</p>
<p>後市僅做即交，夜報載有美棉貸款六千萬之說而開低至四二三元，九七號等買進，尙升至四三四元，一六○號等尙出，而低至四二○元。國行交換差出，塲外復起漲風，二○二號等均進，塲外柃高四五○元外，塲內亦達四四八元新高價。各熱股若新光景福有二○四號，美亞有二○二號二二四號，信和有二二四號爭購，亦告急漲，均見高價。惟有力大戶，若壟某等抬後力售，塞出不下四億股之多，塲外對敲大戶亦告窒息，驪起回風。五四號等力售，回小至四二五元左右。七七號等趁低維持，但一五二號力事出龍，收市仍在四二六元。結果較晨收即交股計美亞倍和華豐中法跌半成，永紗華新閘北榮豐統益火柴新光永公景福勤興新華內衣微挫，景綸小升，中泥升半成弱，大通國貨漲一成有零。塲外各老股若銀行股文化股仍現穩定。</p>

<p>外股昨港電迭縮，人心惶惶，買風更熾，中途熱股再創新高峯，證劵帮錢兌幫廣幫均買，洋行帮稍出，怡紗自三三五○○○元，張到三七七○○○元，會德豐達一○二萬而後有回。結果較前收計墾植業廣平疲，怡紗紙版祥泰航業各升半成，電話電車各漲一成，餘股均告微升。</p>

<h3>競存論略</h3>
<p>— 用丞</p>
<p>秉志著　開明書店出版</p>
<p>這一本小册，字數不過五萬，篇幅不足百面，假如你有半日餘閒，把這本小册細讀一過，你多少會覺得這不僅是一本極饒趣味的通俗科學，恐怕還要認為是一本頂好的公民敎科書或國家領導者的備忘錄。自嚴復譯天演論以後，國人介紹天演學說出版物，巳不下數十種，然而大部都是敷陳事實，介紹理論；能把天演　理，閘揚威立國强種大原則的，我看要推這一本競存論略是第一本吧。</p>
<p>這本書閒宗明義的叙言，就說：「此編之作，為國人警吿也。」可見他這一本小册的寫作，不僅是在介紹科學，還有警吿國人的深意存在。我們如果明白了著者寫作的時間，和他當時所處的環境，我們就可知道著者有何等樣的人格和勇氣。</p>
<p>著者秉農山博士，為國人所共知的生物學泰斗，海內治生物學的學者，多數出他的門下。當八一三上海戰事爆發，不久國軍西移，上海成了淪陷的孤島。在淪陷期間，秉先生伏處海隅，生活極為困苦。他不獨受敵偽的威脅利誘，他還堅守自己的崗位，不時用伏極的筆名，在學林和其他正義的刊物，發表他的天演新論，諄諄指導國人在這非常時間，應走的道路，援來他又將這許多篇文章，補充整理，就成了這一本小册，於廿九年冬出版，次年因太平洋戰事發生，上海完全受了敵人的控制，這一本書我們也就無法在上海買到。勝利以來，好容易最近再版了。</p>
<p>現在我把這本書的眞切內容，約略介紹於下。</p>
<p>第一節，論述動物界由簡單到複雜，由下等動物到高等動物以至于人類，競爭為不可避免，生物世界中就演出種種的慘劇。</p>
<p>第二三四節，論述各種動物對於各種惡劣環境如氣候，飢饉，疾病等的抵抗。人類的祖先，更能運用腦力，戰勝自然，不為氣候所征服，不為飢饉所壓迫，不為疾病所滅亡。</p>
<p>第五六七節，論述動物界為食物，空間，配偶等而競爭，演出種種自相殘殺的慘劇。結果優强者勝而劣弱者敗，但著者並不是「宿命論」者，並不以為弱者就沒有在世界上自存的機會，你看他在二三而說：「……自然本無意志，悉憑生物之演化，循天演的定律，汰弱留强，裁培倾覆，生生不已，以至於斯。然此等强者，能剝削他動物以自肥，殘害同種異種而自殖，究其優勝而永遠蕃殖乎？他動物之受欺凌，竟不克自存，而終歸滅絕乎？則應之曰：一視被害者應付之能力而後定。</p>
<p>第八九十節，論述强者以武力，經濟，文化侵略弱者，尤其對於當時日本侵略中國所表現的凶惡和假面具，揭破無餘。雖然文中沒有寫明是日本，但讀者都能已領會的。</p>
<p>第十一十二十三節，論述動物種類的變遷，和生物的優劣，都以遺傳潛力為發達的決定因素。然優强者若不奮勵，仍不能倖存。所謂「天擇」或「適者生存」，乃是說：「動物團體之中，其分子具同情本能者，若居大多數，其羣必日盛，其後嗣必日蕃。一國之中，其人民若忠勇仁愛，為公犧牲，團結合作者，居大多數看，必能遠勝他族。」</p>
<p>第十四節，論述動物的演進，視神經發達的情形，以判定種類的高下。腦為全身的主宰，腦部愈形發達，動物的生活現象，愈覺進化。進於人類,腦部特別發達，有極有系統的語言文字，所以首出庶物，能克服一切環境，支配全世界。更完全恃人羣互助，以謀生存</p>
<p>第十五十六十七十八節，論述現在世界各民族的腦，大致無甚差異。而所表現有優劣强弱之分者，著者以為或是個人及營養等關係使然。薄弱的身體，果善於培養，可漸臻强健；薄弱的腦力，也可培養而使之改進。</p>
<p>第十九節，論述動物中之弱者，尙能發揮自衛本能，彼此互助。民族之弱者，更需要多數志士，各自努力犧牲小巳，為羣奮鬥。更應利用其民族原有優點，以謀生存。</p>
<p>第二十節，論述弱小民族自救之術，為「自行敎育」。倘一國的人民，都有知識，有技術，有高尙純潔的道德，有担任艱鉅的能力，當然可以强國强種。</p>
<p>統觀全書，都是依「國家至上」「民族至上」立論。現在雖然日本業已屈服，但生物界的競爭，無時或息；我人生命，實未嘗一刻脫離掙扎之苦。我們要奮勵有為，克盡所戰，才能生存。所以這一本小册子，實在値得一讀。</p>
<h3>兒童的美術享樂</h3>
<p>— ·溫肇桐·</p>
<p>託德（J．Todd）蓋爾CN.N.Gale）合著</p>
<p>董任堅譯世界書局出版</p>
<p>在吾國出版界中，美術論著編譯的刋行固少，而美術敎育理論和方法的出版物更少。這本「兒童的美術享樂與應用」，可以說是近四五年來出版界中希有珍品，它給予美術敎育的硏究者與實踐者不少的指引，這種指引，實在是値得實愛的。</p>
<p>美國芝加哥大學敎育系惠得福（WilliamG.Whitford）敎授在本書的「前言」中是這樣的說：</p>
<p>「關於小學的美術敎學文字上已經有許許多多的理論發表；不過有些理論未免趨於極端，它们所主張的觀點，似乎很難為一般美術敎師融化到他們的敎學喪去。</p>
<p>「本書所載，不走極端，而各章叙述都守着近代的立塲而與最近敎育趨势相　合的。它是進步的，——進步而却未超過了近代進步學校的本身。</p>
<p>「本書的作者们都是近代學校的敎師，對敎育有硏究，對兒童有經騐，他們跟着兒童自然的衝動去計劃美術的課程。他們用批判的態度去觀察兒童特種的需要和最適於個性差别的條件。末了，他们硏究出了一個敎學美術入手的方法：那就是美術的享樂和應用應該為兒童發育的一各論理的因素。</p>
<p>「又作者所提示的美術敎學材料很容易與學校課程的各科聯絡統整。它不但可帮助那些敎師希望從兒童獲得創造的，表達的，而且封於那些敎師已經得到兒童的自由表達，更想包括些美術的別個基本方面的，也一樣有所貢献。</p>
<p>「至於本書述及敎材範圍的廣大，各課討論方法的嚴謹，插圖的豐富，和通體對兒童所抱的觀點；足以刺激任何敎師使他在課室技術方面，補充兒童的日常經騐方面都能改進。所舉美術敎學中課室問題與解決那些問題的暗示，不但美術敎師，即一般的兒童敎師知道了也能獲益不少。」</p>
<p>從本書的編制上，是可以機械地把本書分成前後而部，即：第一編享樂；第二編應用。可是，我們細看它的内容，第一編各章實在是偏於美術敎學的原理與原則的指引，特別像「發展個性」，「敎師的部分」等章，而第二編雖然多屬應用藝術的敎材敎法，但在「結論」章中却明白地指示我們以兒童美術敎學的十個要點：　模範的化力，　空間的需要，　材料的豐富，　圖畫簿和展覽會的價値．　擇題的自由，　享樂的注重，　校課必須使兒童感覺興趣，那才能使他要在家裏繼續工作，　設置美術部的價値，　欣賞的實益，　美術室的參觀。</p>
<p>吾國小學美術課程，經去年修改以後，已注重到生活美化的目標的完成，改變國民道德行為為其最高理想的階段·著者曾在最近「敬胃雜誌」發表的「美術課程的現狀」一文申述其梗槪，並特別提出課程內容的要點，其中有「美術的享樂與應用，是美術数學的二翼，從欣賞與創作的敎學獲得享樂；生活出發的敎學應於應用。」一點提出，如果要相瞭解吾國小學美術課程為什麽要這樣修訂？與以怎樣的步驟方可獲取這些的要求？我認為：在目前的出版界中，本書至少可以解決這些問題的。而且，本書的指引，並不是空空洞洞的理論，却是實實在在的方法，並附有一百乡幅插圖來做說明的。</p>
<h3>敎育思想</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>朱經農著·商務三十五年出版</p>
<p>朱經農氏以多年從事敎育行政工作的實際經驗，參照新舊學理的硏究，寫成「敎育思想」一書。驟然看來，好像這本書又是羅列各家敎育學說，叙說各種敎育思潮的。實則這書的重點，却在討論我國近來敎育思想上的聚訟未決的問題，以現實的敎育問題為探討中心。著者希望從我國龐雜與紛岐的敎育思想中，找出理論的正確途徑，使爭辯的問題得以解決。這裏面所討論的問題包括：　自由與紀律，　個人與國家，　鬥爭互動，　學校與社會　知識與道德　藝術與職業，　科學與宗教·著者就這些一般人認為對立的各種敎育問題的爭點，一一予以中正和平的答案</p>
<p>最先在「自由與紀律」一章中，由　國父所解釋的自由，叙說到夕陽敎育思潮中自由的觀念，再申論自由中的紀律與紀律中的自由。著者認為自由是因更爭取的，但欲享充分的自由，紀律決不能缺少。自由與紀律不是相反的，而是相成的。</p>
<p>個人主義，國家主義，民治主義對於敎育都各有不同的看法。討論個人主義，提出戰國時代的楊朱，希臘哲學家亞里斯蒂浦（Aristippus）和盧梭（.JJ.Rausseau）諸家思想·國家主義則以德國的國社主義為代表。民治主義折衷個人與團體。民治主義的敎育才是一條大路，以敎育的力量促進個人對於社會福利的關切；同時亦使社會能夠保障個人的自由與天才的發展。</p>
<p>對於社會進化的期求，有人主張鬥爭，有人主張互助。由達爾文的物競天擇說道馬克斯的階級鬥爭說，都是系那個藉戰爭以求社會發展，而克魯泡特金則提倡「互助論」，認為生活界的進步及人類社會發展的原因全靠彼此互助通力合作。今後中國的敎育自然要强調維護世界和平這個前提，應從兒童和靑年的心上一掃戰爭的禍根。不過在爭取民族生存的原則下，國防敎育也不能完全漠視。卡耐「鬥爭與互助」這一章，至少可以消除一些不正確的偏見，而加强「通力合作，以發展共同福利」的信念。</p>
<p>「知識與道德」原是相輔相成的，可是表現於目前靑年生活和行動上的却是二者脫了節。論述這問題的一章首先叙說構成知識的因素，再討論道德觀念，歸結到知行合一與德智雙修。著者覺得學校的課程必須與校外生活連貫，使知識能應用於生活，有益於品性。品性的薰陶和良好生活態度的培養，應從參加共同生活中磨錬出來。「敎育不能離開生活，知識不能離開行為，道德不能離開實地經驗」，這是很値得我們加以思索的。</p>
<p>一般人也許知道藝術修養的重要，也許知道職業敎育的需要，但却很少了解藝術實用化與職業藝術化得眞義。本書著者在「藝術與職業」一章中力嬌誤認二者為對立的錯誤觀念。他說：「職業敎育的範圍，不僅包括拔術訓練，同時也包括文化修養和公民訓練等等。」又說：「藝術修養與職業訓練，是人生不可缺少的兩種要素。生活必須藝術化，同時也須實用化，藝術不但是美的，愉快的，而且是有實用的」</p>
<p>最後討論的是「科學與宗敎」，著者認為今後中國欲建立物質的國防，不得不注重科學；但同時為建立精神的國防，便不能抹　宗敎對個人精神啓發與感召的作用。改善物質環境和增加生產一定要提倡科學，要造就富於工作熱情和正義感的國民，又不能不從宗敎信仰中培養他們的天地正氣和內心靈命。「為天地立心，為生民立命，為往聖繼絕學，為後世開太平」，似乎只有宗敎家能負荷這重任。</p>
<p>我覺得這本「敎育思想」雖然不是洋洋大著，但立論精闢，要言不煩，而語出有源，行文淸利，即非專門硏究敎育者，為明瞭近代思想的爭辯情形，亦可取之一讀。</p>
<h3>普式庚傳</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>吉爾波丁著·綠熒譯</p>
<p>國際文化服務社出版</p>
<p>普式庚，這位只活了三十七歲的詩人，他逝世的那年，離開現在已經有一百多年了，然至今仍為世界各國文壇熱烈地追念與敬仰着，這是歷史上不易多得的事。這正證明了，世事雖變故多端，紛争擾嚷，相繼不已；但是人類的性，還是能愛護天才，和崇尙智慧的，這使我們活在今日苦難年代中的人，深心仍有無限欣慰之感！</p>
<p>現在我們已確認，文學作品，絕不是為少數公子哥兒而寫，牠應該是服務人民，敎育人民的。百年前的普式庚巳經為此而努力了。他奠定了俄國文學寫實主義的基礎，他以新現實主義的精神，給俄國文學開闢了一條康莊的大道，推翻過去一味為君主效忠的虛偽的宮庭文學。</p>
<p>普式庚文學遺產的價値，著名的批評家培林斯曾經這樣說：「普式庚的創作境界，完全沒有荒唐，空想虛偽，和空漠的理想……的成分；徹頭徹尾都充滿着現實的精神。他不在人生的顏容上抹上一紅粉，祗是把自然按照本來的美麗，再現給人家看。在普式庚的創作裏，天是存在的；然而，那时常是渗透了地氣的天。」日本作家米川正夫也說過：「普式庚除將新的現實主義之精神帶進幼稚的俄國文學，而使其確立獨立的國民意義，構成歷史價値之外；同時，他還是一各具有堪與歌德此肩之素質的偉大的天才藝術家，和天才思想家，放射着永不晦暗的光輝。「這是我們在了懈普式庚之前，應該先有的認識。</p>
<p>在我國翻譯界上，迻譯普式庚的作品不算多，並且因為他的作品，大多是用韻文寫成的詩作，迻譯特别困難，因此，我想一般讀者對普式庚的認識，還是不够深入的，這本「普式庚傳」，正好給我們很好的帮助。</p>
<p>本書共分十二篇：一，普式庚的時代；二，普式庚的童年；三，高等學校；四，普式庚畢業後在聖彼得堡的生活；五，普式庚流放到南方；六，普式庚流放在米哈伊羅夫斯基村；七，普式庚和尼古拉一世；八，一八三〇年秋天在波爾吉諾；九，結婚之後；十，迫害和孤獨；十一，决鬥和死；十而，人民的悲傷。我們讀過全篇，很容易的可以看出作者吉爾波丁是帶着默念沉重的心情，去書寫詩人的一生的。他不是專為讀頌詩人的輝煌的天才，祗是似寫下一個平凡人们歷史一樣地忠實而　素地叙述着，簡明扼要地指出詩人思想的成長，和他生活寫作的態度。</p>
<p>普式庚生於一七九九年，那時候正是沙皇亞歷山大第一和尼古拉第一統治的時期，君主專權獨裁正是登峰造極，大多數貴族都是反動的，他們有意地頑固地支持農奴制度和專制政體。當時的文學寫作，受着假古典主義重大的影響，並成為支配一切的力量，主張模仿陳舊的文學範本，反對眞實得描寫當代生活。普式庚生於這時，他的家庭雖然又是很有名望的貴族，但是從詩人少年的時代起，他便沒有同化在這進流的環境中。他有獨立性，自尊心，愛自由；他蔑視上游社宙和毕躬屈節的奴隸性。他憎惡當時社會的黑暗之深，於他後來所說的话可見，他說：「給我靈魂和才能，却讓我生在俄國，這是魔鬼的作祟呵！」他的一生，就像是一幕天才和愚昧並且與　虐相鬥爭的惨痛的悲劇。</p>
<p>從詩人短速的生命看來，我們好像看見了一隻矯健的燕子，不畏暴風雨的襲擊，在密雲驟雨中飛掠而過。</p>
<p>他的死，是悲劇性的生活中，最悲劇的結束。因為名譽與愛情，受到毁謗和繼續不断的謠言中傷，使他決定和坦特斯決鬥。坦特斯（或譯作當泰）是一個法國的逃亡者，一個無恥的冒險家，他拜荷蘭人赫克盎作義父，在俄國做禁衛軍裏的軍官。一八三七年一、月二十七日普式庚和他决鬥，不幸詩人受致命傷，延至二十九日即與世長逝。</p>
<p>他的死震動了整個俄羅斯的人民，當時的一個女孩子這樣述說着：「常他的遺體停留在家裏的三天中間，各種年齡各種職業的人民羣眾，繼續不斷的圍着他的棺材。女子，老人，孩子們，學生，　羊皮外套的平民，有的甚至　着破衣，都來對他們愛戴的民族詩人的遺憾鞠躬。看見這北平民的敬重令人感動。…」這巳說明了人民是如何地熱愛和敬仰他　的詩人。</p>
<p>我們生在今天世界各國都在熱切地追求自由民主的新時代要，在這時去回憶普式庚的一生，和讀他的傳記，是有着新的意義的。我們堅信着世界的自由民主必然能够實現，正和我們相信普式庚的不朽似的：</p>
<p>「我永遠不會死亡——在豎琴裏</p>
<p>我的不朽的靈魂將要永生——」</p>

<h3>Secretary of State Marshall Announces Drafting of Long-Term Aid to China Plan; U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes $60 Million Aid to China Bill; Officially Submitted to Congress on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 25th] After the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the $60 million aid to China as part of the foreign aid bill, Secretary of State Marshall simultaneously issued a statement saying that he is preparing to draft a long-term aid to China plan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee today provisionally passed a temporary aid bill of $549 million, which includes $60 million in aid to China. The State Department's $597 million bill was reduced by $48 million by the committee. Aid to France, Austria, and Italy has been reduced, but the $60 million for China has been passed. The committee's action to reduce the State Department's request and include China in the temporary aid plan still requires the committee's final approval before the national bill is formally amended, passed, and submitted to Congress. According to committee members, the bill will be submitted to Congress on December 1st. Although the amended bill requires final approval, there is no doubt that the committee will implement the amendments passed today.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 25th] Congressman Judd, on the 25th, following Marshall's request for $597 million in aid to the three countries, which was reduced by $108 million by Congress, proposed an amendment. Marshall's request, after being submitted to the clerk of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was immediately revised into a $549 million aid fund for four countries, including China. Judd said that the committee believes that if aid is to be granted, it should be implemented under the most favorable conditions and as quickly as possible. He said that Marshall had hinted that his aid to China plan would be completed before January. The committee believes that if the temporary aid plan includes China, the State Department can immediately use the funds when Marshall's plan is completed, without further delay. He said that the items for China's purchase of goods are not specifically stipulated, but he learned that China's greatest need is for oil, cotton, and similar products, rather than food. Judd said that he has not yet discussed his amendment on the China issue with other Senate officials, but he pointed out that Senate Leader Vandenberg had said on the 24th that he advocated aid to China. Observers recall that Senator Morse delivered a speech in the Senate on the 24th, advocating that China be aided on the same basis as Western Europe. Judd said that there is not only hope but also full confidence that his amendment will be passed by both houses of Congress. The bill stipulates that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will immediately advance $100 million after the measure is passed. The spokesman for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Voorhis, said that the reduction in expenses for France, Italy, and Austria was based on the amount of available funds outside the country. At the same time, support for the bill in the Senate is increasing daily. Senate Leader Vandenberg predicts that it will be passed by an overwhelming majority on the night of the 26th. Voorhis said that the House bill does not specifically stipulate the amount of aid to each country, but he said that based on the speeches and reports released by the committee, it has been clarified how Congress will allocate the funds.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Congressman Judd said that it is a mistake for the U.S. to concentrate all its anti-communist forces in Europe while neglecting China. He said that, in fact, with less funding, more can be accomplished in China than in Europe. He continued, "In the movement to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating the world, there are two fronts, namely, the European and Asian fronts." Judd said, "We are now making a mistake, that is, allocating $20 billion on one front, while not giving a single penny to the people who are fighting the same war on another front."</p>
<h3>Authoritative American Sources in the Capital Discuss the Goals of Economic Aid to China; Military Assistance is Also Only a Matter of Time</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] An authoritative American source here told reporters that the U.S. government is conducting aid to China in response to public opinion. After Marshall announced the guarantee of aid to China and the approximate amount on the 10th, there were no objections from either the government or the public. Important figures in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have been urging it, and powerful figures in the Republican Party are planning to attack the Democratic Party for its weak aid to China. Therefore, the action of aid to China has reached fruition and is expected to be specifically implemented after obtaining a legislative basis in the short term. However, Secretary of State Marshall's focus seems to remain on the economic and social stability of the Chinese government's controlled areas. Marshall believes that a stable rear area is an absolute requirement for achieving victory on the front lines, and rear area stability can only be ensured by an abundance of supplies and currency stability. The source said: Marshall still believes that the National Army's excellent equipment will not be surpassed by the Communist Army, and he considers stabilizing the rear area to be the main objective of aid to China. The announced $300 million loan, agreed upon by both parties for the purpose of stabilizing the currency, and the first phase of $60 million in urgent allocation, are obviously part of the tools to cope with price fluctuations at the end of the year. The first goal of Marshall's economic aid to China plan is to prevent the value of the legal tender from continuing to depreciate, so that China's financial difficulties can be resolved. The second goal is to prevent the economy from being burdened by finance, and to use the supply of foreign materials to stabilize the people's lives and psychology. If so, the morale of the front lines will be greatly boosted, political power can ensure military victory, the Communist Army will inevitably be at the end of its rope, and peace can be restored. The source said: He is unaware of any large-scale military aid to China, but he is unable to predict what will happen in the future, as this is also a matter of objective need, only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Currency Reform Requires $400 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Economic expert and member of the National Economic Council, Huang Yuanbin, commented on the temporary foreign aid bill passed by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying: The content of the bill is not fully known due to unclear telegraphic communication. However, based on the trend of U.S. aid to Europe, this $60 million aid to China loan is far from our imagination and does not help solve China's current economic crisis. The current economic situation in China must be reformed by reforming the currency system in order to achieve stability. The reform of the currency system requires, in addition to the government's existing foreign exchange reserves, a line of credit of $400 million to be completed.</p>
<h3>Lou Tongsun Discusses the Aid to China Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Economic authority Lou Tongsun said: We hope that the passage of the $60 million aid to China bill by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee is the beginning of Marshall's comprehensive aid to China plan. We welcome this kind of aid, but if American friends really want to help China solve economic problems, we hope that they will continue to provide assistance. Therefore, $60 million or even $300 million is helpful, but it is still far from truly solving our economic problems. At the same time, Lou believes that Marshall's aid to China plan is relatively piecemeal, and he is particularly afraid that this $60 million will not be paid in one lump sum. Subsequently, when reporters asked for his opinion on the issue of currency reform, Lou said: It seems that it is still too early to talk about currency reform unless $300 million can be paid in one lump sum. Lou also said: If China does not rely on foreign aid, the Chinese economy will never collapse, because our country is an agricultural economy.</p>
<h3>Committee for Handling Relief Supplies Established Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Miao Jiaming, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies, and Gu Yuzhen, member and Chief Secretary of the committee, had their first meeting with American representatives Kirkpatrick and Moore on the 26th. They extensively exchanged views on various aspects of the provisions of the Sino-American Relief Agreement, and the results were very satisfactory. The committee will be formally established on the 26th. Whether the U.S. will establish a special small group in the embassy to handle this matter is still awaiting Washington's decision. Miao said that on the Chinese government's side, he will be responsible for handling business and maximizing the effectiveness of the supplies.</p>

<h3>More Than 30 Million Refugees Nationwide; The Government Is Actively Providing Relief; Dong Xianguang Reports on the Progress of the Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Director Dong Xianguang said at a press conference on the 26th: Our country has been disrupted by the Communist Party, and the disaster areas cover Jin, Ji, Yu, Lu, Re, Cha, Tie, Su, Wan, E, Shan, Gan, and the Northeast. Wherever the Communist army goes, they carry out struggles and cleansing, burning, killing, looting, and imposing harsh levies and conscription, destroying transportation, and breaching dikes. All kinds of atrocities are used to the extreme, causing producers to lose their tools, farmers to lose their fields, and others who have lost their livelihood due to war. The young and strong are robbed and forced to become soldiers, and the old and weak are turned into orphans and widows. Therefore, refugees are everywhere and starvation is common. As of yesterday, the Ministry of Social Affairs, based on reports from provincial and municipal governments, councils, and other relevant agencies and groups, and after statistical analysis, has determined that the number of refugees who have escaped from various bandit areas and urgently need relief has reached 33,089,922. This accounts for 7% of the total population of the country. Recently, the Communist army's roaming area has expanded, and the number of refugees that various provinces and cities have not yet reported is not included in the calculation. In order to save the displaced people and stabilize society, the government is supervising various places to earnestly handle relief work, either setting up shelters for the refugees according to their nature, or issuing funds and supplies, or providing loans, or implementing work relief, or introducing employment, or taking in the elderly, weak, disabled, and teaching them skills in orphanages. The central government has allocated relief funds and supplies based on the actual situation in various places. From January of this year to the present, a total of 105,451,820,000 yuan has been allocated for relief funds, 50 billion yuan for loans, more than 70,000 tons of grain, and food and clothing. The central government has made its best efforts to allocate the above amounts, but due to the large number of refugees, not all have been able to receive relief. With the severe winter approaching, the refugees' situation of being frozen and hungry is dire. Relief efforts should be strengthened. A large-scale winter relief campaign has been launched. In addition to mobilizing social movements and general donations in various provinces and cities, the wealthier cities have also been designated to expand their efforts. It is estimated that at least 100 billion yuan or more can be raised, and the competent authorities have requested the Executive Yuan to allocate 50 billion yuan in order to cooperate with the original refugee relief work in various places and step up the work. However, in addition to the 33 million-plus victims of Communist bandit disasters, there are also more than 15 million people who have suffered from floods and droughts, as well as local poor people, who are all in dire need of relief. Further financial and material assistance from all parties is needed to help those in distress and stabilize society.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] In order to strengthen relief work, the government has decided to set up relief zones in various places in Jiangsu and Anhui to distribute funds and supplies on the spot.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Revival of Japanese Terrorist Forces</h3>
<p>Recently, foreign news agencies have been constantly broadcasting news of the underground activities of Japanese terrorist forces. According to a report from the Phnom Penh office of the New Asia News Agency on the 9th of this month, right-wing elements who had disappeared after the surrender have recently shown signs of resurgence. Among them, the "Revolutionary Chrysanthemum Nurturing Comrades Association", the "New Sharp Masses Party", and the "Japanese Innovation Party" are the most famous. Using "upholding the emperor, opposing communism, and advocating democracy" as slogans, they are gathering former soldiers, local landlords, and thugs, attempting to create terror. Just as this news was announced, the General Headquarters of the Allied Powers in Tokyo learned that a terrorist organization existed underground in Japan, more dangerous and more widespread than the former Black Dragon Society. The occupying authorities have called it a "secret government" and believe that if this "government" is not eradicated after the peace treaty is signed and the occupying forces withdraw, it will rise up and seize power. It is reported that this nationwide underground organization has a leader and a committee of ten to twelve people, including former warlords, financial magnates, and giants. All those who sympathize with extreme nationalism, such as shopkeepers, vendors, shoeshiners, as well as local strongmen, thugs, and labor agitators, are members of this organization. They have funds and weapons. All participants must go through a blood oath, fully demonstrating the spirit of Bushido. The Allied Headquarters is paying considerable attention to this situation, but it is unknown how the Allied Headquarters plans to deal with it.</p>
<p>The Allied Headquarters has controlled Japan for more than two years, and political and economic performances are extremely unstable. Reactionary and conservative forces are growing, while the relatively progressive Katayama government is faltering. Undoubtedly, this is the mistake of the Allied Headquarters in condoning the old forces and failing to implement the Potsdam Declaration and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, and preventing and destroying Japanese militarism. According to the Potsdam Declaration, the aggression of Japan must be thoroughly "punished", and the financial groups that "manufactured war" and the socio-economic system that "can enable it to rearm for war" must be dissolved; the "authority and power that desire to conquer the world" and "militarism", namely military institutions and fascist forces, must be eradicated; the "war criminals" who launched and presided over aggression must also be punished. The Far Eastern Commission, in order to supervise the implementation of the Japanese surrender terms and to clear the foundation for the revival of Japanese imperialism, has repeatedly resolved and instructed MacArthur to implement them. In reality, these measures have never been thoroughly implemented; on the contrary, a terrorist organization more dangerous than the Black Dragon Society has emerged today under the control of the occupying forces. This is a threat to the Allied countries, and a terror to the peaceful and democratic future of Japan.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report, the terrorist organizations currently lurking underground in Japan have old warlords and financial groups as their backbone. Before the surrender, the old warlords of Japan, centered on fascists, penetrated deep into the army and rural areas. After the surrender, they disappeared for a time. Due to the neglect of the Allied Headquarters in punishing aggression in recent years, the fascist organizations were not thoroughly dissolved, and war criminals and financial groups all appreciated the "benevolence" of the Allied Headquarters. Therefore, the previous extreme nationalism has revived in a new guise. As far as we know, in addition to organizations such as the "Revolutionary Chrysanthemum Nurturing Comrades Association," which promotes the idea of ​​respecting the emperor with the chrysanthemum water precepts of Nancho loyal minister Kusunoki Masashige, there are also illegal organizations such as the Shimpentai (Divine Soldiers) and the Daito Juku (Greater East School). They are trying their best to clarify that Japan fought for "divine will" and that their failure in the "Greater East Asia War" brought "humiliation" to the emperor. Therefore, they want to organize actions to prepare for the next revenge. This kind of propaganda activity exists not only in rural areas and on the streets, but also has a particularly open development in Hokkaido. They have not only not awakened to the mistakes of the defeat, but are grinding their swords underground, preparing to step back into the historical wrong path after the peace treaty is signed. This is indeed a hidden worry for the future of Japan. In order to establish a peaceful and democratic future for Japan, we hope that the Allied Headquarters will rectify the illegal organizations of the Japanese people and thoroughly eradicate all terrorist forces.</p>
<p>The "Basic Policy for Japan" formulated by the representatives of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission in June of this year stated that the international security and stability depend on the following: First, completely destroying the military institutions of Japan, as this institution has been the main means of implementing aggression for decades; Second, setting up political and economic conditions so that Japanese militarism cannot be revived; Third, enabling the Japanese people to thoroughly understand their war intentions, expedition plans, and methods of achieving such plans, which have brought them to the brink of destruction. Therefore, the representatives resolved: to completely disarm, reorganize the economy to deprive Japan of the power to fight, eliminate the power of militarism, severely try war criminals, and stipulate a strict period of control. Undoubtedly, the joint decision of the Far Eastern Commission is a correct and reasonable control policy, but the Allied Headquarters has not fully accomplished its task. The United States is now advocating that the countries of the Far Eastern Commission hold a preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan. In fact, there is a distance between the control policy and the decisions of the representatives. The Allied Headquarters has not made Japan comply with the obligations of the surrender terms and abandon militarist ideas and actions. How can we discuss the content of the peace treaty? Therefore, we ask the Allied Headquarters to be sure to implement the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and implement the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission in order to lay a smooth foundation for the peace conference with Japan. The terrorist organizations that exist underground in Japan today are a threat to the future peace treaty with Japan; only by eliminating the power of militarism, severely trying war criminals, and disarming Japan economically and ideologically can the peace conference with Japan be successful. The current opportunity is very urgent, and we hope that the Allied Headquarters will make a choice!</p>

<h3>Reasons for Decreased Textile Exports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The director replied to reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the market situation in Malaya, I have not yet received an official report. However, according to official sources familiar with the Chinese textile industry, from the perspective of supply and demand, due to the arrival of winter, domestic demand has greatly increased. Textiles have a huge market in the country, and the increase in domestic demand will naturally reduce the number of exports. The temporary reduction in the amount of cotton fabrics exported from China to Malaya is one of the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>The National Assembly representative election was completed last Sunday. This move is a major step forward in the constitutional history of our country. The Chinese people's implementation of universal suffrage is an unprecedented event in history. Through this general election, democratic politics has officially begun, which is gratifying. I am convinced that we will continue to improve along this great step in the future. The ballots are currently being counted and will be released soon.</p>

<h3>Important Documents Seized by National Army in Shandong Province; A Letter from a Communist Bandit Cadre Frankly States that Military Morale Has Collapsed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan Air Dispatch] This is the most valuable item among the large number of documents seized by Qiu Qingquan's troops, one of the five main forces of the National Army, while fighting the Communist bandits near Yuncheng in southwestern Shandong. It is a letter from Wang Danian, political instructor of the Third Column of the Communist bandits, to Chen Yi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch of the Communist Party of China, frankly stating the current situation of the Communist bandits. After reading this letter, readers will not find it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding and deep understanding of the Communist bandits' "failure complex," "self-preservation ideology," "escape teams," "die running if you can't die fighting, starve if you can't die running," and "counter-attack, counter-attack, lose the mountains and freeze." The following are the main points of the letter: Minister Chen:</p>
<p>...For more than two months, I have not seen newspapers or received telegrams. The team is also moving every day, and at most I can only receive a little bit of fragmented information, as if I am in a drum. Occasionally, a telegram is sent by that column, which is like getting a treasure. I still can't receive newspapers, and telegrams can still be received, but there is a severe shortage of printing ink and paper, and I can't buy them anywhere. Comrade Lai Shaoqi wrote to Director Tang asking for some printing ink. The store director said: I can't do it anymore, don't ask me to conjure it up. As a result, Lai himself went to the Political Department and divided half of the printing ink, making it very difficult for us to print our own things.</p>
<p>There is also a big problem here, which is the difficulty of food. We often only eat two meals, but we can't get enough to eat. It's good to be able to eat sorghum and millet. (Reporter's note: Most of the New Fourth Army cadres are from the south.) Fortunately, everyone is now used to eating sorghum and millet, but the cadres and soldiers in the army inevitably have some "strange talk."</p>
<p>In daily life, there is a lot of marching, and there is water everywhere. If you are not careful, you will fall into it, especially in the northeast of Shan County. One trip is seven or eight li, at least two or three li, and no one does not get their feet wet. I also get my feet wet while riding a horse. They swell up and I can't find a path. The National Army is following closely behind, and it's even worse if I don't walk. Now it's a little shallower, and the weather is clear. Maybe it will be better in half a month or so. Daily necessities such as paper cigarettes and soap are not available at all, but pears and persimmons are enough to eat.</p>
<p>...A large number of enemy propaganda materials have been collected, but unfortunately they were wetted and damaged when crossing the river, and only a few are left now. The content of this propaganda is indeed absurd, but they have indeed grasped many of our weaknesses, which deserves our vigilance. The form is very good and worth learning from to break the old pattern.</p>
<p>I've rambled on a lot! Now, I will briefly report to you the situation of the troops that I understand:</p>
<p>Number of troop reductions: The Third Column started from central Shandong and suffered a total reduction of 6,000 people after the Jining battle. The Jining battle resulted in 5,344 casualties. Non-combatant reductions in the entire column totaled 700 people, for a total of 6,044 people. The Fourth Column suffered a total reduction of 6,183 people from the north to the Shandong-Henan-Hubei Military Region (statistics as of August 19) (missing the column's direct subordinates and the 10th Division). The Tenth Column had 2,000 deserters after leaving central Shandong and arriving in Shandong-Henan-Hubei, so we didn't attack Wen Shang much? After that, we really couldn't stop the main force of the Fifth Army of the National Army from crossing the Grand Canal. It is said that the situation of troop reductions in the First Column is even more serious. The troops are currently continuing to do so. The 79th Regiments of the Third Column have been reorganized into two regiments, and the Fourth Column has reduced nine companies and some platoons. Only the Eighth Column has maintained its vitality, but they don't care about fighting and only focus on making a fortune everywhere.</p>
<p>Ideological situation: After the Jining battle, the Third Column generally produced a sense of failure, because five companies went in and didn't come out, and almost nine companies were completely casualties. There are four specific reactions after the war;</p>
<p>First, complaints: complaints are common from top to bottom and left to right. The highest level complains about Commander Chen, who committed subjectivism. Regimental-level cadres said: "This was a good battle to eliminate the enemy, but unfortunately the higher-ups didn't manage the food supply well, so it's no wonder the cadres below the regimental level. The complaints from below are generally about the lack of grenade launchers, poor command, the loss of the wounded numbers (referring to the wounded), and the corpses, and the lack of initiative and cooperation from others; the Eighth and Ninth Divisions complain to each other, complaining about the propaganda workers who bragged, because they said during the mobilization that as long as they were surrounded, they would definitely break through, and there were only remnants of the 72nd Division of the National Army in the city, at most two regiments, with only three cannons, one of which couldn't be fired, and they were all babbling remnants; but the complaints also revealed a lot of accurate opinions, which are worthy of reference by leaders.

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Agree on Agenda; Order of Discussion Still Needs Further Negotiation</h3>
<p>[News Report] London, 26th Broadcast. The second meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was held today at 3:30 p.m. Greenwich time. Differences between Eastern and Western countries on the Austrian issue may quickly lead to a compromise. The duration of this meeting is scheduled to be limited to three hours.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th Dispatch] Evening newspapers learned that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will propose a "bargaining" suggestion on the Austrian peace treaty at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent, it is believed that Molotov may agree to make the Austrian issue the first item on the agenda if the Foreign Ministers' Conference can immediately pass it and then discuss the drafting of the German peace treaty procedure. At noon today, Marshall went to Churchill's private residence to have lunch with Churchill.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers met for three hours today and agreed on six agenda items, but the order of discussion has not yet been determined. The six agenda items are as follows: Report of the Austrian Peace Treaty Committee; Form and scope of the German interim political organization; Principles of German economic unity; German borders and procedures for drafting a peace treaty; Forty-year anti-German convention, the so-called Berners Treaty; Implementation of the Moscow Conference's disarmament proposal. The inclusion of the fifth item on the agenda is a victory for the United States, and the inclusion of the sixth item is a victory for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 25th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers agreed on six agenda items at today's opening meeting, but remained split three to one on whether to discuss the Austrian or German issue first. The United States, Britain, and France requested Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to discuss the Austrian issue first in order to quickly reach an agreement and comfort the anxious world. US Secretary of State Marshall said, "It is extremely important for us to make a quick decision to comfort the people of the world." However, Molotov still insisted that the German issue was more important and should be discussed first. French Foreign Minister Bidault proposed a compromise, suggesting that the agenda stipulate that the Austrian issue should be discussed first, but in practice, after a brief discussion, it should be handed over to the foreign ministers' representatives, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference itself should then discuss the German issue, which Molotov still opposed. Bevin then asked, "If we cannot reach an agreement on the German issue, will we no longer conclude a treaty on Austria? We must state our motives." Molotov agreed to discuss the US proposal for the four countries to conclude a treaty to jointly monitor Germany's disarmament for forty years, but at the same time, he must discuss the failure of Western countries' policies to disarm Germany.</p>

<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 25th Dispatch] Senator Connally, a senior Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Congress today to approve emergency relief for France, Italy, and Austria. He said in a speech to the Senate: Approving emergency relief is a necessary prelude to any long-term plan, the purpose of which is to help European free countries to help themselves and maintain their legacy of freedom. Connally gave a speech in support of the $597 million emergency relief bill. Another supporter, Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a speech on Monday strongly supporting the bill. It is expected that after discussions and votes on various amendments on Wednesday, the entire Senate will vote on the bill. At the same time, the House Foreign Affairs Committee is also working on a draft of its emergency relief bill in preparation for submitting it to the House of Representatives for consideration.</p>
<p>US Treasury Authority Supports Anti-Inflation Proposal</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 25th Dispatch] Treasury Secretary Snyder and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Eccles testified today in Congress in support of President Truman's anti-inflation proposals, advocating reducing government securities held by banks and opposing a sharp reduction in taxes before foreign aid costs and public debt regulations are determined. Snyder assured the House Banking and Currency Committee that "protecting the US economy from 'further' inflationary pressures is as important as providing early aid to Western Europe." Although he claimed to focus only on financial matters, he also strongly supported credit controls like Eccles. Smith supported most of the controls planned by Truman before, but he only talked about credit control and public debt sales plans.</p>

We will go hand in hand, and we will not change our original intention. We will defend our freedom and independence against all enemies.

<h3>Mad Train Headed Straight for Shanghai, Disrupting Train Schedules, All Express Trains on the Beijing-Shanghai Line Delayed, Disabled Veterans Forcing Suzhou Station Master to Let Them Pass, Fortunately No Accidents Occurred</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 505th military train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway departed from Nanjing yesterday morning, carrying a batch of disabled veterans from the Xuzhou Military Hospital to Shanghai, to transfer to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to Xiaoshan. At 11 AM, when the 505th train was passing the Qiantang train at Changzhou Station, the disabled veterans in the 505th train suddenly climbed onto the Qiantang train, wanting to take it to Hangzhou. As the Qiantang train was a reserved-seat train, it was difficult to accommodate soldiers without tickets, and the station military police and station master rushed forward to dissuade them. These people started shouting and smashed three windows and two doors of car 613 of the train. Later, a large number of police officers from the Joint Military Police Office arrived to suppress them, and the Qiantang train was able to escape and depart. As a result, it was delayed by eight minutes upon arrival in Shanghai, and passengers were also frightened. At 2:33 PM, when the 505th train carrying the disabled veterans arrived at Suzhou Station, it was supposed to wait for the 5th Beijing-Shanghai down express train. The disabled veterans were unwilling to stop and wait, and got off the train to surround the Suzhou Station master, forcing him to let the train depart immediately. The station master had no choice but to let the 505th train go first, and notified the train dispatcher to pay attention at all times to avoid a train crash. The "mad train" should have waited for the Jinling train at Guanzhuangli Station, but it was finally allowed to go straight to Shanghai due to the coercion of the soldiers on the train. The train schedules on the Beijing-Shanghai Line were completely disrupted, and the Qiantang train, the Jinling train, the 5th express train, and the 77th Shanghai-Wuxi commuter train were all delayed.</p>

<h3>All Occupational and Women's Ballots Counted, Seamen's Union Has the Most Invalid Votes, Why is Zheng Hongnian on the Education Association Ballot?</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The vote counting for the occupational groups election has been completed yesterday. Over 800,000 ballots from twenty-one occupational groups have been successively tallied and announced in the past three days, and were all sealed and boxed yesterday. Except for the ballots from the labor union, the farmers' association, and the municipal women's association, three local groups that will remain sealed in the election office, the rest will be sent to Nanjing for national processing. In summary of the votes opened in the past three days, the seamen's union had the most invalid votes. Most of the seamen added their membership number when writing the ballots, resulting in 5,000 votes being invalidated according to law. Also, the candidate Chen Dingshu (Democratic Socialist Party) from a local women's group found over 200 ballots in the ballot box of a national women's group. Because they were incorrectly cast, they were also invalidated. Some votes in the telecommunications union had the words "difference money" written on them, the meaning of which is unknown. In the education association ballots, six ballots actually wrote "Zheng Hongnian," which is even more bizarre. The number of votes for each group opened yesterday is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Gogeliy Steamer to Enter Port Today, 800 Soviet Overseas Chinese to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Soviet steamer Gogeliy, carrying over 160 overseas Chinese from Vladivostok returning to their home country, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. According to customs sources, the steamer did arrive at Wusongkou at 9:30 yesterday morning. After the doctors from the seaport quarantine station boarded the ship to inspect the passengers, it was planned to enter the port immediately. However, due to the lack of a reliable dock in the port, it temporarily anchored outside the port last night and will enter the port at 11:00 this morning, docking at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. It is expected that about 800 Soviet overseas Chinese in the city will return to their home country on the steamer.</p>
<h3>Some Overseas Chinese Bring Japanese Wives</h3>
<p>[Another Report] It is learned that a batch of overseas Chinese came to China on the "Gogeliy" this time. These overseas Chinese originally resided in Japan.

Upon hearing this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office plans to inspect the Chinese nationality certificates of these people after they arrive in Shanghai. If they do not have proof of nationality, they will be treated the same as Japanese women residing in China, and will still need to be sent back to Japan in accordance with the regulations in the future.</p>

<h3>Frugal Banquets, Group Affairs Meeting, Unlicensed Restaurants Given Warnings</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Banquet Frugality Inspection Group of the Municipal Frugality Supervision Committee held a meeting in the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to review the inspection work.

After exchanging opinions, considering that it was the first time that these restaurants had violated the frugality regulations, it was requested that the police bureau issue a warning. In addition, it was agreed to persuade restaurants to sell more set meals at the lowest price, with the maximum price not exceeding 25,000 yuan. Furthermore, the wine and vegetable industry association will print flyers and post them in various restaurants, advising customers not to give extra tips.

<h3>Retired Major General - With a Wife Already - Overseas Chinese Daughter Uncovers Secret, Endures Abuse, and Files Lawsuit</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Lude, a young woman of American citizenship born in Honolulu, Hawaii, in the Pacific Ocean, lost her father early in life. Over a decade ago, her mother, Madam Yu Xiao, brought her back to China and settled in Shanghai. She studied at the Central Girls' High School and worked as a female secretary for many years after graduation. On New Year's Eve in December of the year of the Republic (likely 1935 given context), Yu met Wang Xiu, who claimed to be the Major General Wang, Director of the Liaison Office of the Third War Area Command stationed in Shanghai, at the New Celestial Forest Ballroom through the introduction of a friend. The woman was beautiful, and the man was young and handsome. Love blossomed between them, and they wished to spend their lives together. Soon, they became intimate, and Yu became pregnant. To preserve appearances, they began living together in February of this year, and in mid-March, she gave birth to a son, named Beibei. Due to the financial difficulties of the family, Yu rented Room E, Number 8, on the fourth floor of the Lincoln Apartments, opposite the Cody Milk Bar on the central section of the Linsen Road, for them to live in.</p>
<p>A Violent Nature Leads to Abuse</p>
<p>Little did she know that Major General Wang was already married to a woman named Dai Momei. In April of this year, Dai suddenly visited Wang at the Lincoln Apartments and encountered Yu Lude. Wang introduced Yu as his sister-in-law, and Yu welcomed her, suspecting nothing. However, the next morning, she discovered the "Major General" sleeping with his "sister-in-law," and after investigating, she learned that Dai Momei was the "Major General's" "fallen wife." Only then did she realize that she had been deceived. Because Wang's affair was exposed by Yu, he held a grudge and often abused her over trivial matters.</p>
<p>Firearms and Ammunition Found in the Room</p>
<p>On the evening of September 8th, he again used a pretext to beat Yu severely, from 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM, lasting five hours. Yu, unable to endure it any longer, attempted to commit suicide by jumping from the building, but failed. She then hired lawyer Ge Jilu to report to the police station. After examining Yu's injuries, they went to the Lincoln Apartments and arrested Wang. At the same time, they found a Mauser pistol, six bullets, two handguns, eleven bullets, and a Mauser pistol in the room. When questioned, Wang Xiu declared, "I am a soldier, you police cannot arrest me." The police then telegraphed the Garrison Headquarters, and after confirming that he was not an active-duty soldier, they arrested him and sent him to the bureau for interrogation, then transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office to be prosecuted for assault and endangering public safety (possessing military weapons).</p>
<p>Skin and Bones, Half Her Original Weight</p>
<p>Yesterday, at 10:00 AM, the Second Criminal Court of the District Court began the trial. The victim, Yu Lude, wore a purple silk cheongsam, a short gray overcoat, and a coffee-light yellow two-tone scarf. She was as thin as a rake, barely able to stand, and looked very pitiful. She testified in court, stating that Wang did not work and that she paid for all the food and expenses. Wang not only did not express gratitude but instead abused her, causing the victim's weight to drop from 120 pounds to 60 pounds, as evidenced by a doctor's certificate.</p>
<p>Mauser Pistol Received</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendant testified, "I was the Deputy Director of the Major General's office, but that office was abolished in November of the 34th year of the Republic (Likely 1945). I am now unemployed. The Mauser pistol belonged to a guard named Xu Chengwei, the handguns were entrusted to me by Peng Yaguang, the Deputy Chief Officer of the Army Reorganization Division, for repair, and the Mauser pistol was received. I did not abuse Yu. I was even concerned about her health and accompanied her for physical examinations, caring for her to the best of my ability. How could I have beaten her?" The plaintiff's lawyer presented a letter from Wang Xiu's sister to Wang Xiu, dated July 6th of this year, stating that Yu was virtuous and urging Wang not to abuse Yu but to change his past attitude and treat her gently. The court adjourned the case to continue the trial on the 3rd of next month.</p>

On October 13th, after 6:00 PM, while Miss Lu (referring to Lu Yanru) went out to dance, I took a few pieces of clothing and ran away, holding my little brother (Yu Sheng) in my right hand and carrying a bundle in my left hand. First, I pawned two coats, then I pawned a cheongsam. I stayed in a hostel for one night, and the next morning I took the train to Nanjing, intending to find a friend, but I couldn't find them, so I came back." When asked why she stole things and also took the child, she replied, "I really like the little brother. I couldn't bear to leave him, so I took him." When asked again if she had stolen 2.75 million legal tender in collusion with Wang Zhengfa, she replied, "I didn't steal any banknotes, and I didn't collude with anyone."

<h3>Chen Chunpu Seeks Death to Avoid Death Sentence - High Court Concludes Retrial Yesterday - Denies Participating in Signing "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Chunpu, who served as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Executive Yuan and the Puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, was previously sentenced to death by the High Court. After Chen petitioned for a retrial, the Supreme Court remanded the case for a new trial. The retrial concluded yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of December 3rd. The two secret debates yesterday focused on four points: 1. Whether he participated in the signing of the so-called "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty" and the military secret alliance between the puppet government and the Japanese invaders. 2. Whether the defendant's secret departure from Chongqing to Hong Kong in June of the 27th year of the Republic (likely 1938) was intended to join the puppet organization. 3. Whether the defendant, during his tenure as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, did indeed ban opium and drugs and engage in actions beneficial to the people. 4. Whether the defendant went to Tokyo, Japan, in August of the 33rd year of the Republic (likely 1944) to participate in the enemy's memorial day ceremony to pray for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Chen responded to the above four points yesterday, stating: 1. When Wang Jingwei signed the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty" with Japan in Shanghai, the defendant was still in Hong Kong and did not participate in it. Those who participated were Zhou Fohai, Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, etc. 2. In the 27th year of the Republic, I went from Chongqing to Hong Kong to escort one son and one daughter of Wang Jingwei. Because his daughter was already seventeen years old at the time, it was not reassuring to send others. I had a kinship relationship with Wang and was also older, so I took on this responsibility. Going to Hong Kong had no political purpose. 3. The facts of banning opium and drugs are all available in the archives of the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government. 4. In August of the 33rd year of the Republic, I went to Japan to visit my wife's illness, because my wife was suffering from a uterine inflammation and was recuperating in Japan. It was not to participate in the "Greater East Asia War Victory Memorial Day" prayer.</p>

<h3>During the Enemy and Puppet Period - Lingling Massacre Case - As Dawn Breaks, Bandit Leader Tang Chuwang is Caught</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hengyang, 21st] In February of the 33rd year of the Republic (likely 1944), the enemy launched the Xiang-Gui Campaign in an attempt to open up mainland communications. In June, the Defense of Hengyang began. After Wei Yang was captured on August 8th, they followed and advanced south. The cities and towns along the Xiang-Gui Railway fell one after another. Linglu, an important town in southern Hunan, also fell into enemy hands in early September. At this time, the people were both escaping the enemy's bayonets and suffering from bandit attacks and murders. The Lingling massacre case unfolded during this dark period.</p>
<p>Wealthy in Remote Villages, Bandits Covet</p>
<p>The victim of the massacre, Jiang Xucun, was an honest businessman in Linglu with sons Jiang Wei, Jiang Chun, Jiang Qing, Jiang Min, and son-in-law Zhou Shilin. They had jointly invested in opening the Cultural and Great China paper and stationery stores and the Xiangyong Stone Printing Bureau on the main street of Linglu County for many years. The business was thriving and had considerable savings. In the 32nd year of the Republic, Jiang Wei served as a material officer at the Houching Bank. He was cautious in his work and deeply trusted by the bank, which made him even more famous. At the beginning of the Japanese offensive, Jiang Lu預 located a prefabricated shed factory in Taojia, Beichong in Daxiao Township, Ling County, for the purpose of dispersing goods and bank materials. When Changsha and Hengyang fell one after another, all the goods from the Cultural, Great China, and Xiangyong stores, as well as the materials from the Houching Bank, the family members of the staff, and their luggage, were dispersed to the shed factory and the nearby goose egg residence, and buried in kilns. When Lingling fell to the enemy on September 6th, the Jiang and Zhou families all fled to the Beichong shed factory. This place was relatively remote, and no enemy traces were found, so they thought it was extremely safe. Little did they know that wealth in remote villages would be subjected to the poison of gangsters.</p>
<p>Bandit Tang Poisons and Burns the Shed Factory</p>
<p>The Jiang family's massive wealth inevitably aroused the covetousness of others. There was Hu Shaohou, the head of Daxiao Township, Tang Chuwang, the military instructor of the county government, Wang Yao, the leader of the 8th Bao patrol team, Jiang Shi, the township brigade attachment, Tang Xianshen, the township cadre, Zhang Xiaonan, etc., relying on their special powers. Having both political power as cover and armed forces as backing, they jointly decided to dispatch Tang Chuwang and Wang Yao with dozens of people and guns, as well as a machine gun, in two groups to surround the shed factory in Beichong at dawn on September 20th. They captured Jiang Xucun and his three sons Jiang Qing, bound them with ropes, and looted all the luggage, gold jewelry, legal tender, etc. in the shed. Those that could not be stolen were set on fire together with the shed factory.</p>
<p>Meeting on a Narrow Road, Fighting to the Death</p>
<p>At that time, Jiang Wei, Jiang Chun, Jiang Min, and Zhou Shilin were all away on business. When they returned in the afternoon, they arrived at the Banling Temple area, and they met Tang Chuwang and others who were looting and going down the mountain. In a fit of anger, Jiang Wei and others fought with the Tang bandits. Due to the disparity in numbers, Jiang Wei and Zhou Shilin were shot dead on the spot, and Jiang Chun and Jiang Min were injured and captured. The next day, Tang sent someone to shoot Jiang Chun to death. Afterwards, they successively robbed all the goods buried in goose egg. Jiang Xucun and his son Jiang Qing were captured and taken to the Huangjiangyuan Temple gate area, where they were imprisoned in a dark room, with feet in shackles and hands in handcuffs, and threatened with shooting every day. As a result, they extorted 80,000 silver dollars and also extorted 40,000 national currency for the funeral expenses of the bandit soldier Liu Jianming who was killed in the conflict, as well as tens of thousands of yuan for straw sandals, in addition to extorting pork, wine, chicken, duck, etc., as gifts for release, before they were released from the tiger's mouth. In total, Tang and others looted more than 10 billion yuan based on the currency value at the time, truly an unprecedented massacre.</p>
<p>Sinking Like a Stone, Unjust Grievance Unredressed</p>
<p>The organization of the Tang bandits was initially the Daxiao Township Office, then changed to the Self-Defense Force, then changed to the Joint Township Brigade, and finally claimed to be the Lingling Command, with Tang calling himself the commander, Wang Yao as the deputy, Hu Shaohou as the director of the Joint Township Office, Tang Xianshen as the military supply director, Zhang Xiaonan as the military judge, and Jiang Shi as the brigade commander. After Jiang Xucun was released, he rented a house in the deep mountains, because at that time the occupied area had not been recovered, and the entire township was the world of the Tang bandits. Not only was it impossible to appeal, but his life was also in danger at any time. Therefore, this lawless massacre case has been like a stone sinking into the sea, and there is no way to redress the injustice.</p>
<p>Requesting Justice After Recovery</p>
<p>In August of the 34th year of the Republic (Likely 1945), the country was recovered, and the political situation gradually returned to normal. The Tang bandit organization disintegrated, and Jiang Xucun began to return to the city and file petitions with the Seventh District Commissioner's Office, the Lingling County Government, and the Lingling District Court, requesting redress. However, the Tang bandits were all "underground workers" at the time and had fled far away. Tang Chuwang entered the Capital Central Training Corps Officers Team, Wang Yao entered the Southern Prison Officers Fourth Platoon, using military status as protection, and Zhang Xiaonan even openly entered the Lingling County Government to work as a financial section clerk. After Jiang Xucun repeatedly sued, only Hu Shaohou was arrested and brought to justice, sentenced to thirteen years of fixed-term imprisonment.</p>
<p>Quietly Returning, the Evil Demon is Captured</p>
<p>Jiang Xucun was unwilling to see the Tang bandits still at large, and after repeatedly suing, the Tang bandits were finally dismissed and investigated in Beijing. In fact, this was nothing more than a dismissal, so Tang was still a free man. Since Tang had no official position, he quietly returned last month. After the victim learned of Tang's whereabouts, he filed a report with the District Court, which arrested Tang on the 8th of this month. This murderous demon king, the bandit leader who had done all kinds of evil, after being fortunate enough to escape the law for three years, was finally caught. It is heard that the other major criminal, Wang Yao, retired from the officer team and is now working at the Hankou Municipal Hospital, while Tang Xianshen and Jiang 倓 are unknown and are being searched for.

Physical education students beat up four engineering students including Xiang Quanze, especially Tang Peide, whose injuries are the most serious, with continuous bleeding in his urine, and his life may be in danger. The reason is that the physical education department of Chongqing University, in order to celebrate the inauguration of the new council of the student union, scheduled a performance on the afternoon of the 24th. Xiang Quanze was careless in his conversation, jokingly calling the physical education department a circus troupe, and said he was going to Songlinpo to watch the circus. It happened to be heard by a physical education student passing by the roadside, and a conflict arose due to disagreements, causing a great disturbance. It is confirmed that Chongqing University students are currently partially striking. If the school authorities do not handle it properly, the situation will likely escalate.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Qingqi Township: "Dull Head" Murdered on His Way Home</h3>
<p>"This newspaper Wuxi 25th dispatch" Zhu Renkang, a resident of Zhutongbian in Qingqi Township, the third district of the county, is over fifty years old. He co-owns the Xielong Department Store with others at the Xiaosifang Lane entrance in Beitang and operates the Rongkang Paper Shop independently in Dongxinqiao, Shanghai. Zhu has one wife and one concubine. The first wife, Yan, has a son named Ruiliang, who is now twenty-six years old. He has been foolish since childhood, and the neighbors all call him "Dull Head". Five years ago, he married Jin Yun, the daughter of Wu Hesheng, a peddler from Xiaoxiankou. They already have a three-year-old daughter named Xingfu (Happiness). Although Wu comes from a humble background, she is beautiful. Feeling that her husband is not handsome and does not understand romance, she feels like a phoenix following a crow. Therefore, she often lives at her brother-in-law Zhao Xijin's house in Beizhakou, occasionally returning to her home. "Dull Head" often makes a fool of himself, often causing laughter, which is a popular topic in the village. Ruiliang, as a young boss, wanted to work in the Xielong store. On the 22nd of this month, Ruiliang went to Suzhou alone. On the 23rd, he returned to Wuxi. After resting in the store for a while, he took a small suitcase and a silk quilt, saying he was returning home. However, on the morning of the 24th, Ruiliang was found dead in the mulberry field behind Chonggu Lane (about four li from his home). Beside him was a pig-killing knife with two knife wounds on his neck, the wounds being very deep. Zheng Shigui, the patrol officer of the Qingqi Police Substation, received the news. Considering it a major homicide case, he immediately led the police to investigate. They thoroughly searched the area around the body and the mulberry field but found no traces of blood. The wool-lined robe, flannel trousers, and rubber shoes worn by the corpse were also free of blood stains, raising many suspicions. It was suspected that the deceased was killed elsewhere and the body moved to this location. At 8 a.m. on the 25th, Zhu Yan, the mother of the deceased, together with Wu Axing, the Gangzheng (neighborhood head) of the 251st Tu (neighborhood), came to the city to report to the District Procuratorate of the court, requesting an autopsy. Prosecutor Shen opened a court to question them and then went to the countryside with officials to conduct the autopsy. The autopsy revealed that Zhu Ruiliang had a stab wound on the back of his neck and another on the right side of his neck, confirming that he was stabbed to death while alive. After the autopsy, the family was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial, pending investigation and arrest of the murderer. The reporter went to the countryside to conduct an on-site investigation. According to the neighbors, the couple was often at odds. "Dull Head" was often rejected when he tried to share a room with his wife. However, his wife, Jin Yun, is currently several months pregnant. The deceased's mother, Yan, considering her son to be "Dull Head", did not want to delve too deeply, saying that he might have encountered robbers on the way. Therefore, the cause of death is strange and worthy of investigation.</p>

<h3>Do Traitorous Officials Have a Guilty Conscience Towards Loyal and Good People? The Pseudo-County Magistrate Liang Yongnian Revises the Guan Di Scripture in Prison</h3>
<p>"This newspaper Hainan Island 21st dispatch" After Liang Yongnian, the former pseudo-Qiongshan County Magistrate, was arrested and imprisoned, his life in prison was quite comfortable due to his wealthy family. Moreover, his wives and concubines fill the courtyard, and they take turns visiting him three times a day, morning, noon, and evening.

<h3>Self-Funded Overseas Students Can First Settle Foreign Exchange at Market Prices</h3>
<p>Applications for Foreign Exchange Settlement Have Reached More Than 2,400</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch] The Non-Imported Goods Foreign Exchange Application Review Committee of the National Bank announced on the 26th that the review of self-funded overseas student foreign exchange applications was originally carried out in accordance with the review methods approved by the Executive Yuan on June 23. Except for the students who passed the Ministry of Education's Second Self-Funded Overseas Study Examination who are waiting to go abroad, who were approved by the Executive Yuan to be reviewed and processed by the committee, the remaining students who are already abroad must be sent to the Executive Yuan for review. Later, because the Executive Yuan announced the "Revised Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange" on August 17, all applications sent for review were returned and changed to no longer require review. However, except for self-funded students who passed the examination and have examination certificates and study certificates, who were approved by the Executive Yuan on September 11 to settle foreign exchange at the official rate, the exchange rate for the remaining self-funded students has not been determined. In order to avoid delaying time and causing applicants to suffer from the increasingly high foreign exchange losses, the designated banks are notified that those who are willing to purchase foreign exchange at market prices first are allowed to do so. After the Executive Yuan announces the exchange rate, if they are entitled to the official rate, they will be adjusted. These measures have been reported to the Executive Yuan by the Central Bank for the record and will be followed after receiving the "Rules for Foreign Exchange Settlement for Public and Self-Funded Overseas Students" issued by the Executive Yuan. According to the committee's statistics, since its establishment on June 23 of this year, until the date of the announcement of the rules by the Executive Yuan on October 24, a total of 2,148 self-funded overseas student foreign exchange applications have been received, and 1,876 have been processed. As of the 24th of this month, a total of 2,403 applications have been received, and 2,238 have been processed. The remaining 165 applications have been received recently and are being processed. The committee immediately sends all processed applications back to the original designated banks and instructs them to notify the applicants. If any applicants have not yet received them, they should contact the designated banks as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Dr. Liu Zhan'en's Tenth Memorial Anniversary: Shanghai University Prepares for Commemoration</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] Dr. Liu Zhan'en, former President of Shanghai University, devoted his life to education and also participated in national salvation work.

<h3>Talking About "Strikes" from the Perspective of a Professor (Continued) (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Binbin</p>
<p>Let me talk more about the "strike" scene I have experienced: Every strike is decided by the student union, and then "orders are carried out without exception." Meetings are sometimes held late at night, sometimes in the morning, and sometimes in the afternoon. If the decision is made late at night, when the professors arrive at the school the next morning, the classrooms are empty and silent, and they return in vain. If the meeting is held in the morning, the meeting place is full, the classrooms are empty, and the professors wait in the lounge. Some smart professors, knowing that the decision will inevitably be a strike, are sure that there will be no classes in the afternoon, and they take the opportunity to leave first. Some "foolish teachers" are still waiting for "orders." If the meeting is held in the afternoon, without waiting for a decision, the day's work will of course not be able to be carried out, and the classrooms will already be empty.</p>
<p>The school can't control it, and the students don't notify, the professors are at a loss!</p>
<p>The dates of the strike are decided, or one day, three days, seven days, ten days, as much as is indefinite. When it is time to resume classes, no one notifies the professors. The professors at home can only call the school at any time to inquire. Those who do not have a telephone at home have to go to the school a few times in vain. Because the school administrators believe that this is beyond their duties, they don't care at all, and the students' strike and resumption of classes only take care of their own side, and there is no formal procedure to notify the professors.</p>
<p>Every time after a strike is decided, sometimes a "short note" or a "memo" is sent to the teachers' room. Although they call them "teachers" or "sir", the content is like an order (sometimes there is no such short message, only a few words are passed on to the workers), and when classes are resumed, only slogans are posted, without any other procedures. The professors are all at their homes (because of the strike, they don't go to school). The student union doesn't send anyone to inform the professors' private residences, and the professors can't bother to run to the school to inquire. Only when the news is published in the newspaper do they know that classes have resumed. It is a strange thing that the affairs of teachers and students in a big school have to rely on the education news section in the newspaper to exchange information!</p>
<p>The staff of the school's academic affairs office and dean of students office are unable to interfere with the strike, so naturally they don't care about it, and even less can they take on the obligation of notifying the professors. The servants follow the orders of the school and cannot follow the orders of the students. So even though the students are on strike and the classrooms are empty, the workers who ring the bell still ring the bell (up) and shake the bell (down) according to the time of the class schedule, "I go my own way". So even though the school is silent, the neighbors outside the wall hear the sound of the bell and think that the school is attending classes on time. It is like a wild temple in a desolate suburb, with the cold and clear Sanskrit chanting, reporting the time, which is also a strange scene.</p>
<p>I once had a private conversation with a student, saying that we teachers usually rely on the curriculum and notices from the academic affairs office to attend classes or take vacations, but now there is an extra "student union". However, when the academic affairs office suspends classes or takes vacations, it must first send messengers to the professors' homes two days in advance to send letters, so as not to run in vain. This is a definite principle, and even if the "student union" is the superior, it should have a pre- and post-method. Even if the professor should obey the students, how can he obey? How can he submit? The student smiled and said: Just let it go, let's look at everything like this!</p>

<h3>中央銀行行撥款三百億　搶購蘇北墾區棉花　由中國農民銀行負責收購　蘇北棉產約在百萬担以上</h3>
<p>The Central Bank has allocated 30 billion yuan to purchase cotton from the reclamation areas of northern Jiangsu, with the Bank of Chinese Farmers responsible for the purchase. Zhao Baoquan, assistant manager of the Agricultural Bank, Chun of the letter department, Wang Tong, director of the land finance department, Ouyang Ping, deputy director of the agricultural products department, and Zhou Jiyao, director of the business department, traveled to Nantong and Sanyu Township on the 23rd of this month for on-site inspections. They returned to Shanghai on the 25th and will go to Beijing. It is reported that the Agricultural Bank has been ordered to start purchasing from the Sanyu Township reclamation area. Due to the disturbance of the Communist bandits in the northern Jiangsu reclamation area, many young men have been conscripted, and no one is harvesting cotton. The cotton is still tightly attached to the cotton branches. The Agricultural Bank has now commissioned Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory and various Suken companies in northern Jiangsu to handle the purchase matters and has formed a flower-picking team to harvest the cotton from the cotton branches and keep it in custody for the farmers. The cotton that has been collected will be counted and taken over by the Agricultural Bank. The cotton production in northern Jiangsu this year is estimated to be over one million dan. The quality is excellent, and there is no adulteration. The local market price is about 4 million yuan per dan. Although the funds allocated by the government this time are limited, they can be used in a circular manner. It is initially estimated that 10,000 dan can be produced.</p>
<p>In addition, the Agricultural Bank also intends to reform land finance in the northern Jiangsu reclamation area. After this inspection, a concrete plan will be formulated, which is said to be aimed at supporting self-employed farmers.</p>
<h3>華股高峯迭見：臨收賣多疲軟</h3>
<p>Hua stocks fluctuated greatly yesterday. The situation was dangerous. Large investors did whatever they wanted. Off-market deals were common, and actions were erratic. The black market outside the circle was soaring. The hot stocks in the middle of the session all saw new highs, but some were cut short and became weak and trance-like near the close.</p>
<p>The market still struggled to rally in the morning. Spot and forward cotton yarn presented an inverted situation. Spot opened at 404 yuan, and forward opened at 400 yuan. After the opening, forward prices dropped from 404 yuan as No. 76 and others sold off, falling to a low of 394 yuan for spot and 395 yuan for forward. No. 148 and others took back to recover to above 400 yuan. At this time, there was not much trading. Off-market interest rates opened higher to 2 jiao 4 and 2 jiao 8 and a half, but it was difficult to see any signs of improvement. Later, as Hong Kong and China Electric repeatedly reported shrinking, the off-market black market jumped again, and foreign stocks soared, the off-market asking price was always 5-6 yuan higher than the on-market price. People's confidence improved. Guangdong Gang No. 202 and the short-selling group No. 148 continued to buy. No. 154 and others competed to take spot and forward. Near noon, the price rose to a new high of 440 yuan for spot and 442 yuan for forward, and then closed at 438 yuan and 441 yuan. Among the familiar stocks, small stocks such as Xinguang Jingfu and Meiya were the most profitable. As a result, according to the pre-closing figures, Yongsha, Xinhuo, Huazong, Qinxing, Zhongfa, Neiyi, Zhongni, and Guohuo rose by half a percent. Huaxin, Wenbei, Yonggong, Xinhua, and Rongxiang rose slightly. Zhongxing, Zhongfang, and Jinglun remained flat. Xinya, Datong, and Tongyi declined slightly. Among the forward stocks, Meiya and Jingfu rose by one percent, Xinguang Qinxing Xinhuo, and Yongsha rose by half a percent, and Huafeng rose slightly.</p>
<p>Only spot trading was done in the after-market. The night report mentioned a US cotton loan of 60 million, which opened lower to 423 yuan. No. 97 and others bought, but it still rose to 434 yuan. No. 160 and others continued to sell, and it fell to 420 yuan. The Bank of China exchange difference occurred, and a rising wind rose again off-market. No. 202 and others entered, and the off-market price rose to above 450 yuan, and the on-market price also reached a new high of 448 yuan. Various hot stocks such as Xinguang Jingfu, Meiya, and Xinhuo also rose sharply as No. 204, No. 202 and No. 224, and No. 224 competed to buy. However, powerful large investors, such as Long, sold heavily after raising the price, dumping more than 400 million shares, and off-market deals were also stifled, causing a returning wind. No. 54 and others sold heavily, and it recovered slightly to around 425 yuan. No. 77 and others took advantage of the low to maintain the price, but No. 152 was actively selling, and the closing price was still at 426 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Meiya, Beihe, Huafeng, and Zhongfa spot stocks fell by half a percent, Yongsha, Huaxin, Zhabei, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Huochai, Xinguang, Yonggong, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinhua, and Neiyi declined slightly, Jinglun rose slightly, Zhongni rose slightly by half a percent, and Datong Guohuo rose by a little over one percent. The various old stocks off-market, such as bank stocks and cultural stocks, remained stable.</p>
<h3>統債參差不一　外股買風熾盛</h3>
<p>Government bonds rose slightly yesterday, while miscellaneous brands were slightly lower. There were uneven performances. Trading was limited, only around 4 million. The fluctuations in the middle were also narrow. Unified C opened at 23,000 yuan in the morning, falling to 22,700 yuan, rising to 24,000 yuan, and then consolidating slightly. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B were down 100 yuan, Class C was up 500 yuan, Class D was down 200 yuan, and Class E was up 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks shrank again in Hong Kong yesterday, and people were panic-stricken. The buying trend was even stronger, and hot stocks hit new highs in the middle of the session. Securities brokers, money changers, and Guangdong brokers were all buying, while foreign firms were selling slightly. Yisha rose from 335,000 yuan to 377,000 yuan, and Wheelock reached 1.02 million and then rebounded. Compared to the previous close, Ken Zhiye and Guangping were weak. Yisha, paper, Xiangtai, and shipping rose by half a percent, telephone and tram each rose by one percent, and the remaining stocks rose slightly.</p>
<h3>金融特種營業稅　洽商特種營業稅</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of levying a special business tax on the financial industry, there are many aspects in terms of tax rates and technology that require urgent research.

<h3>有關當局否認　輸管會撤銷說</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Yesterday, there were rumors in the market that the Import and Export Control Commission would be abolished.

<h3>委旗購麥磨粉　糧部繼續辦理</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food commissioned the Fuxin, F茂, Xinhua, Huafeng, and Yutong flour mills to purchase wheat and grind flour on its behalf. Since the start in mid-July, the first phase of the contract ended at the end of the month. A total of 120 billion yuan was put into operation, purchasing 2.4 million dan of wheat, and 1.5 million bags of flour have been milled to date. However, there is still a large inventory of purchased wheat, and only one-tenth of it has been used in the past. About 1 million dan remain. Therefore, the mills are still milling this flour on behalf, and it can last for about three months. It is now learned that in order to maintain the food supply for the people in various places, the Ministry of Food has decided to continue the second phase of purchasing wheat and grinding flour on behalf. It will still be undertaken by the five major flour mills. The second phase of wheat funds and various procedures are being discussed with the mills.</p>

<p>[Cotton Yarn Negotiated Prices Increased Again, the Price of Cloth is Rising Sharply, and 42 Blue Phoenix Yarn Breaks the 50 Million Mark]</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Cotton Spinning Association adjusted the negotiated price of cotton yarn again yesterday.

<p>[Import and Export Control Commission Formulates Handling Measures for Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Import of Wool]</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Import and Export Control Commission has decided on handling measures for wool arriving at ports and already shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without a permit. The contents are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>The purchase and distribution of wool raw materials arriving at ports and already shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without a permit, which have been registered with the Secretariat of the Commission in accordance with Announcements No. 2, No. 4, and No. 9 of the Commission, shall be handled in accordance with these measures.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned wool raw materials arriving at ports and already shipped shall be purchased by the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with the measures stipulated in Announcement No. 7 of the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission shall increase an additional quota outside the import quota for wool raw materials in the fourth and fifth quarters. The additional quota shall be US$1.5 million per quarter, which shall be used to offset the above-mentioned wool raw materials and shall not provide foreign exchange.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned additional quota for the fourth and fifth quarters shall be distributed to the wool-using factories in accordance with the normal quota distribution method.</p>
<p>Each factory with the above-mentioned orders for wool raw materials arriving at ports and already shipped may apply for purchase with the quota obtained under the additional quota item. If such orders exceed its entitled additional quota, it shall be allowed to apply for purchase with its normal quota. The normal quota shall be reduced by 50% of the value of the purchased raw materials and no foreign exchange shall be provided. (That is, each application for purchase of self-provided foreign exchange orders of 1 yuan shall offset 5 jiao of the normal quota).</p>
<p>The goods imported by the importer independently (and not sold to the wool-using factory) may be sold by the Central Trust Bureau to factories that have no orders sold at the port or whose orders are insufficient for their additional quota, in accordance with the ratio after purchase.</p>
<p>If a factory's orders arriving at ports and already shipped exceed the additional quota and it is unwilling to apply for purchase with its normal quota, or if there is still a surplus after offsetting its normal quota, it may transfer the excess to factories that have no orders or whose orders are insufficient for their additional quota. The purchase and sale methods shall be the same as in Article 6.</p>
<p>The surplus quota (quota for the supply of foreign exchange) generated by the deduction of the normal quota due to the fact that a factory's orders exceed the additional quota may be used to subsidize factories that have no orders or whose orders are insufficient and still unable to purchase the additional quota in full in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of these measures. Each yuan of subsidy for the remaining quota shall offset 2 yuan of the foreign exchange quota. However, the total normal quota for the supply of foreign exchange shall still be limited to US$2 million per quarter. The factory orders or the goods independently imported by the importer mentioned above shall be based on the description in the application form when registering with the Secretariat of the Commission.</p>
<p>The price of the wool raw materials arriving at ports sold by the Central Trust Bureau shall be the price at the port of discharge plus 50% (converted into legal tender at the market exchange rate). The customs duties and the leasing, unloading, and transportation costs before and after the sale shall be handled in accordance with Article 14 of Announcement No. 7 of the Commission.</p>
<p>The method for the purchasing factory to pay for the goods shall be handled in accordance with Article 13 of Announcement No. 7 of the Commission.</p>
<p>Importers who are unwilling to fulfill the above conditions may apply for re-export in accordance with Article 6 of Announcement No. 3 of the Commission and Article 16 of Announcement No. 7.</p>

<h3>預防兒童迷路走失　衣襟宜佩領號布條</h3>
<p>[Preventing Children from Getting Lost: It is Advisable to Wear a Numbered Cloth Strip on the Collar]</p>
<p>This is a letter from the 39th Bao Office of the Penglai District: The purpose of this Bao Office is to address that many children are lost and are crying and wailing. Mr. Chen Wenqing, the representative of this Bao area, launched the "Children's Numbering Movement", which was previously submitted to the District Public Office of the four Bao districts and then to the Municipal Government for approval. The so-called "Children's Numbering Movement" is to use a specially made numbered cloth, stating the child's residence, the district, Bao, Jia, and household to which it belongs. It is best to fill it in according to the household registration card. This should be sewn on the center of the collar or the center of the upper part of the placket. If the child gets lost, he/she can return home safely because he/she has a child's number. The procedure is simple, and the effect is great. In order to seek assistance from the public opinion community, we would like to ask your newspaper to publish this letter to seek happiness for the millions of children in this city. It would be a great blessing for the society and the country! (Note: This method is simple and effective. It is published to attract the attention of children's parents. As for the so-called specially made numbered cloth, please contact the 39th Bao Office of the Penglai District at 28 Tangjiawan Road for sales locations.)</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Theory of Competition</h3>
<p>— Yong Cheng</p>
<p>Written by Bing Zhi, Published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>This small book, with only about 50,000 words and less than 100 pages, can be thoroughly read in half a day of leisure. You will find that it is not only a very interesting popular science book, but also a very good civic textbook or a memorandum for national leaders. Since Yan Fu translated "Evolution and Ethics," dozens of publications introducing the theory of natural selection have been published in China. However, most of them elaborate on facts and introduce theories. In my opinion, this book, "A Brief Discussion on the Theory of Competition," is the first to promote the great principles of natural selection for national strength and racial improvement.</p>
<p>The preface of this book, which clearly states its purpose, says, "This compilation is a warning to the Chinese people." It can be seen that the writing of this small book is not only to introduce science, but also to convey a profound meaning of warning to the Chinese people. If we understand the time when the author wrote it and the environment he was in at that time, we can know what kind of personality and courage the author had.</p>
<p>The author, Dr. Bing Nongshan, is a well-known biological science giant in China. Most of the scholars in the country who study biology come from his school. When the August 13th Shanghai Incident broke out, the national army moved west shortly afterward, and Shanghai became a besieged isolated island. During the period of its occupation, Mr. Bing lived in seclusion in a corner of the city, living a very difficult life. He was not only threatened and enticed by the enemy and puppet regime, but he also stood firm in his position and, under the pseudonym Fu Ji, published his new theory of natural selection in "Xue Lin" and other righteous publications from time to time, earnestly guiding the Chinese people on the path they should take during this extraordinary time. Later, he supplemented and reorganized these articles to form this small book, which was published in the winter of the 29th year. The following year, due to the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai was completely controlled by the enemy, and we could no longer buy this book in Shanghai. After the victory, it was finally reprinted recently.</p>
<p>Now I will briefly introduce the true content of this book below.</p>
<p>Section 1 discusses how competition is unavoidable in the animal kingdom, from simple to complex, from lower animals to higher animals and humans, and how various tragedies are played out in the biological world.</p>
<p>Sections 2, 3, and 4 discuss the resistance of various animals to various adverse environments such as climate, famine, and disease. The ancestors of mankind were even better at using their brains to conquer nature, not to be conquered by climate, not to be oppressed by famine, and not to be destroyed by disease.</p>
<p>Sections 5, 6, and 7 discuss the competition for food, space, mates, etc. in the animal kingdom, and how various tragedies of mutual slaughter are played out. As a result, the superior wins and the inferior loses. However, the author is not a "fatalist" and does not think that the weak have no chance to survive in the world. You see what he says in Sections 2 and 3: "...Nature has no will of its own, and all depends on the evolution of living things. Following the law of natural selection, it eliminates the weak and preserves the strong, cultivating and overthrowing, endlessly, until now. However, can these strong ones exploit other animals to enrich themselves, and harm the same and different species to colonize themselves, and ultimately win and reproduce forever? Will the animals that are bullied be unable to survive and eventually become extinct? The answer should be: it depends on the ability of the victims to cope."</p>
<p>Sections 8, 9, and 10 discuss the strong invading the weak with military force, economy, and culture, especially the ferocity and masks shown by Japan's invasion of China at that time, which are completely exposed. Although it is not explicitly stated in the text that it is Japan, the reader can understand it.</p>
<p>Sections 11, 12, and 13 discuss that the changes in animal species and the advantages and disadvantages of living things are all determined by the genetic potential for development. However, the superior and the strong cannot survive if they do not strive. The so-called "natural selection" or "survival of the fittest" means: "Among animal groups, if most of the members have the instinct of sympathy, their group will surely prosper and their descendants will surely multiply. In a country, if most of the people are loyal, brave, benevolent, loving, selfless, united, and cooperative, they will surely far surpass other races."</p>
<p>Section 14 discusses that the evolution of animals depends on the development of the nervous system to determine the rank of species. The brain is the master of the whole body. The more developed the brain, the more evolved the life phenomena of animals become. When it comes to humans, the brain is particularly developed, and there are very systematic languages and characters, so they are the first among all things, able to overcome all environments and dominate the whole world. They rely entirely on mutual assistance among people to seek survival.</p>
<p>Sections 15, 16, 17, and 18 discuss that the brains of all ethnic groups in the world today are roughly the same. As for the differences in superiority, inferiority, strength, and weakness, the author believes that this may be due to individual and nutritional factors. A weak body can gradually become strong if it is well cultivated; a weak brain can also be cultivated to improve it.</p>
<p>Section 19 discusses that even the weak among animals can exert their self-defense instincts and help each other. The weak of a nation need more patriots to work hard and sacrifice their small selves to fight for the group. They should also use their nation's original advantages to seek survival.</p>
<p>Section 20 discusses the art of self-salvation for small and weak nations, which is "self-education." If the people of a country all have knowledge, skills, noble and pure morality, and the ability to undertake difficult tasks, they can of course strengthen the country and the race.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole book, the argument is based on "national supremacy" and "racial supremacy." Although Japan has now surrendered, the competition in the biological world never ceases; our lives have never been free from the pain of struggle for a moment. We must strive to be promising and do our best to fight in order to survive. Therefore, this small book is really worth reading.</p>
<h3>The Joy of Art for Children</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Co-authored by J. Todd and CN.N. Gale</p>
<p>Translated by Dong Renjian, Published by World Book Company</p>
<p>In the publishing industry of our country, there are few publications of art theories and translations, and even fewer publications of art education theories and methods. This book, "The Joy and Application of Art for Children," can be said to be a rare treasure in the publishing industry in the past four or five years. It provides many guidelines for researchers and practitioners of art education. This kind of guidance is really worth loving.</p>
<p>Professor William G. Whitford of the Department of Education at the University of Chicago in the United States said in the "Preface" of this book:</p>
<p>"There have been many theories published in writing about art teaching in elementary schools; however, some theories tend to be extreme, and the views they advocate seem difficult for general art teachers to integrate into their teaching.</p>
<p>"The content of this book does not go to extremes, and the narratives in each chapter adhere to modern viewpoints and are consistent with the latest educational trends. It is progressive—progressive without exceeding the modern progressive school itself.</p>
<p>"The authors of this book are all teachers in modern schools, who have research on education and experience with children. They follow the natural impulses of children to plan art courses. They use a critical attitude to observe the special needs of children and the conditions most suitable for individual differences. Finally, they have studied a method of starting art teaching: that is, the joy and application of art should be a logical factor in children's development.</p>
<p>"In addition, the art teaching materials suggested by the author can be easily linked and integrated with the various subjects of the school curriculum. It can not only help those teachers who hope to obtain creative and expressive abilities from children, but also contribute to those teachers who have already obtained children's free expression and want to include some other basic aspects of art.</p>
<p>"As for the breadth of the teaching material range mentioned in this book, the rigor of the discussion methods in each lesson, the richness of the illustrations, and the overall view of children, it is enough to stimulate any teacher to improve in classroom technology and supplement children's daily experience. The classroom problems in art teaching and the suggestions for solving those problems are not only beneficial to art teachers, but also to general children's teachers."</p>
<p>From the compilation of this book, it can be mechanically divided into two parts, namely: the first part, enjoyment; the second part, application. However, if we look closely at its content, the chapters in the first part are really biased towards the guidance of the principles of art teaching, especially chapters such as "Developing Individuality" and "The Teacher's Part." Although the second part is mostly about teaching materials and methods of applied art, the "Conclusion" chapter clearly instructs us with ten key points of children's art teaching: the power of modeling, the need for space, the richness of materials, the value of drawing books and exhibitions, the freedom of topic selection, the emphasis on enjoyment, school lessons must make children feel interested, so that they will want to continue working at home, the value of setting up an art department, the practical benefits of appreciation, and visiting the art room.</p>
<p>After the revision last year, the elementary school art curriculum in our country has paid attention to the completion of the goal of beautifying life and changing the moral behavior of the people to its highest ideal stage. The author once stated its outline in an article "The Current Situation of Art Curriculum" published in the recent "Jingwei Magazine" and specifically put forward the key points of the curriculum content, including "The joy and application of art are the two wings of art mathematics. Enjoyment is obtained from the teaching of appreciation and creation; teaching that starts from life should be applied." If you want to understand why the elementary school art curriculum in our country should be revised in this way? And what steps can be taken to obtain these requirements? I think that in the current publishing industry, this book can at least solve these problems. Moreover, the guidance of this book is not empty theory, but practical methods, and it is accompanied by one hundred and fifty illustrations to explain.</p>
<h3>Educational Thought</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Written by Zhu Jingnong, Published by Commercial Press in the 35th year</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong wrote the book "Educational Thought" based on his practical experience in educational administration for many years and with reference to the research of old and new theories. At first glance, it seems that this book is again a list of various educational theories and a narrative of various educational trends. In fact, the focus of this book is to discuss the unresolved problems in my country's recent educational thought, with realistic educational problems as the center of discussion. The author hopes to find the correct theoretical path from the complex and divergent educational thoughts in our country, so that the disputed problems can be resolved. The problems discussed here include: freedom and discipline, individual and country, struggle and interaction, school and society, knowledge and morality, art and occupation, science and religion. The author gives fair and peaceful answers to the controversial points of these various educational problems that are generally considered opposite.</p>
<p>First, in the chapter "Freedom and Discipline," from the freedom explained by Sun Yat-sen, it narrates the concept of freedom in the setting sun educational thought, and then elaborates on discipline in freedom and freedom in discipline. The author believes that freedom is something that is fought for, but discipline cannot be lacking if one wants to enjoy full freedom. Freedom and discipline are not opposite, but complementary.</p>
<p>Individualism, nationalism, and democracy each have different views on education. The discussion of individualism puts forward the thoughts of Yang Zhu in the Warring States Period, the Greek philosopher Aristippus, and Rousseau (.JJ.Rausseau). Nationalism is represented by German National Socialism. Democracy compromises between the individual and the group. Democratic education is the only broad road, using the power of education to promote the individual's concern for social welfare; at the same time, it also enables society to protect the individual's freedom and the development of talent.</p>
<p>Regarding the expectation of social evolution, some advocate struggle, while others advocate mutual assistance. From Darwin's theory of natural selection to Marx's theory of class struggle, they all seek social development through war, while Kropotkin advocates "mutual aid," believing that the progress of the living world and the development of human society depend entirely on mutual assistance and cooperation. In the future, China's education must naturally emphasize the premise of maintaining world peace, and should sweep away the roots of war from the hearts of children and young people. However, under the principle of striving for national survival, national defense education cannot be completely ignored. Kanai's chapter on "Struggle and Mutual Assistance" can at least eliminate some incorrect prejudices and strengthen the belief in "cooperation to develop common welfare."</p>
<p>"Knowledge and morality" were originally complementary, but what is manifested in the current youth life and behavior is that the two are disconnected. The chapter discussing this problem first narrates the factors that constitute knowledge, then discusses moral concepts, and concludes with the unity of knowledge and action and the dual cultivation of morality and intelligence. The author feels that the school curriculum must be connected with extracurricular life, so that knowledge can be applied to life and benefit character. The edification of character and the cultivation of good living attitudes should be tempered from participating in collective life. "Education cannot be separated from life, knowledge cannot be separated from behavior, and morality cannot be separated from practical experience." This is something that is worth our pondering.</p>
<p>Most people may know the importance of artistic cultivation, and may also know the need for vocational education, but few people understand the true meaning of the practical application of art and the artistic application of occupations. In the chapter "Art and Occupation," the author of this book tries to correct the erroneous view that the two are opposite. He said: "The scope of vocational education not only includes technical training, but also includes cultural cultivation and civic training, etc." He also said: "Artistic cultivation and vocational training are two indispensable elements of life. Life must be artistic and also practical. Art is not only beautiful and pleasant, but also practical."</p>
<p>Finally, what is discussed is "Science and Religion." The author believes that if China wants to establish material national defense in the future, it has to pay attention to science; but at the same time, in order to establish spiritual national defense, it cannot erase the role of religion in personal spiritual enlightenment and appeal. Improving the material environment and increasing production must promote science, and to create a nation full of enthusiasm for work and a sense of justice, we must also cultivate their integrity and inner spiritual life from religious beliefs. "To establish a heart for the world, to establish a life for the people, to continue the unique learning for the past sages, and to create peace for future generations," it seems that only religious figures can bear this heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>I think that although this book "Educational Thought" is not a large work, its argument is incisive, its main points are not verbose, and its words have a source, and its writing is clear and concise. Even if it is not a person who specializes in education, it can be read to understand the debate situation of modern thought.</p>
<h3>Biography of Pushkin</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Written by Gilpolding, Translated by Lv Ying</p>
<p>Published by International Cultural Service Society</p>
<p>Pushkin, this poet who only lived to be thirty-seven years old, has been dead for more than a hundred years now, but he is still warmly remembered and admired by the literary circles of various countries in the world. This is a rare thing in history. This proves that although world affairs are full of changes, disputes and disturbances continue, human nature can still love genius and respect wisdom. This makes us who live in today's difficult times still feel infinitely comforted in our hearts!</p>
<p>Now we have confirmed that literary works are by no means written for a few playboys. They should serve the people and educate the people. Pushkin had already worked hard for this a hundred years ago. He laid the foundation for realism in Russian literature. He opened up a broad road for Russian literature with the spirit of new realism, overthrowing the false court literature that blindly served the monarch in the past.</p>
<p>The value of Pushkin's literary heritage was once said by the famous critic Belinsky: "Pushkin's creative realm has no absurd, utopian falsehood, and empty ideal... components; it is thoroughly filled with the spirit of reality. He does not put rouge on the face of life, but simply reproduces nature in its original beauty for people to see. In Pushkin's creation, heaven exists; however, it is often permeated with the earth's atmosphere." The Japanese writer Yoshikawa Masao also said: "In addition to bringing the spirit of new realism into the naive Russian literature and establishing its independent national significance and forming historical value, Pushkin is also a great genius artist and genius thinker with the qualities comparable to Goethe, radiating an eternally bright light." This is the understanding that we should have before we understand Pushkin.</p>
<p>In the translation circle in our country, there are not many translations of Pushkin's works, and because his works are mostly poems written in rhyme, translation is particularly difficult. Therefore, I think the general readers' understanding of Pushkin is still not deep enough. This "Biography of Pushkin" is just a good help for us.</p>
<p>This book is divided into twelve chapters: 1. Pushkin's era; 2. Pushkin's childhood; 3. High school; 4. Pushkin's life in St. Petersburg after graduation; 5. Pushkin's exile to the south; 6. Pushkin's exile in Mikhailovskoye Village; 7. Pushkin and Nicholas I; 8. Autumn of 1830 in Boldino; 9. After marriage; 10. Persecution and loneliness; 11. Duel and death; 12. People's sorrow. After reading the whole chapter, we can easily see that the author Gilpolding is writing the life of the poet with a silent and heavy heart. He is not writing to praise the poet's brilliant talent, but is truthfully and plainly narrating as if writing the history of an ordinary person, concisely and succinctly pointing out the poet's ideological growth and his attitude towards life and writing.</p>
<p>Pushkin was born in 1799, when Tsar Alexander I and Nicholas I were in power, and the autocratic monarchy was reaching its peak. Most of the nobles were reactionary, and they intentionally and stubbornly supported the serf system and the autocratic regime. At that time, literary writing was greatly influenced by false classicism and became the force that dominated everything, advocating imitating old literary models and opposing the true description of contemporary life. Pushkin was born at this time. Although his family was also a very prestigious noble family, from the poet's youth, he was not assimilated into this advanced environment. He has independence, self-esteem, and love of freedom; he despises the upstream society and the humble slavery. He hated the darkness of society at that time so deeply, as can be seen from what he said later, "Giving me soul and talent, but letting me be born in Russia, this is the devil's trick!" His life is like a painful tragedy of genius and ignorance and fighting against abuse.</p>
<p>Looking at the poet's short life, we seem to see a strong swallow, not afraid of the storm's attack, flying through the dense clouds and rain.</p>
<p>His death was the most tragic end to a tragic life. Because his reputation and love were defamed and constantly slandered, he decided to duel with Dantes. Dantes (or translated as Dangtai) was a French fugitive, a shameless adventurer. He recognized the Dutchman Heckeren as his adoptive father and worked as an officer in the Guards in Russia. On January 27, 1837, Pushkin dueled with him. Unfortunately, the poet was fatally wounded and died on the 29th.</p>
<p>His death shocked the entire Russian people. A girl at the time described it this way: "During the three days that his body remained at home, people of all ages and occupations continued to surround his coffin. Women, old people, children, students, common people in sheepskin coats, and some even in rags, all came to bow to the remains of their beloved national poet. Seeing this respect for the common people is moving..." This has explained how much the people loved and admired him, their poet.</p>
<p>We were born in a new era where all countries in the world are eagerly pursuing freedom and democracy. It has new significance to recall Pushkin's life and read his biography at this time. We firmly believe that the freedom and democracy of the world will surely be realized, just as we believe in Pushkin's immortality:</p>
<p>"I will never die—in the harp</p>
<p>My immortal soul will live forever—"</p>
