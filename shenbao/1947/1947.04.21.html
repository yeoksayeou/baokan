<h3>民社黨內爭　已告一段落</h3>
<p>李大明表明態度</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷震秘書長於昨晨抵滬，接見記者時稱，此次來滬乃夾加　華學藝社理監事會議，非如外傳之調停民社黨內爭而來；惟因便已與兩方人士晤面。據個人意見，民社黨內爭不如外傳之嚴重，僅為一方面認為常會旣己決定全面參加政府，則行政院部會亦應加人而己。雷氏表示：民社黨之不參加部乃暫時性質，不久可望加入。目前之情形殆不致於影響民社黨參加政府之旣定計劃。此事為民社黨之丙部問題，外人不易說話，且在第三者之立塲，不願開罪任何一方。同時，內爭　因已久，亦非個人短時間所能調處。據聞伍憲子氏可於今日來滬，如此民一社黨各要員相敍一堂，一切問題不難自行解決也。關於國府組織法之修改，雷氏表示民　兩黨並未如外傳之要求主席向兩黨負責，故問題不難解決，今日南京對此可望有所決定。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕民社黨京總支部於廿日下午三時，在該黨京辦事處舉行成立大會。出席各支部主委六十餘人，蔣勻田出席指導，沈正崙為臨時主席，選舉譚開雲等為總支部委員，並定廿一日下午八時舉行首次委員會。</p>

<h3>台省警備總部宣布　宵禁時間再縮短　台南繳武器自首者日衆</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿日電〕台灣同胞對於中央政府改組一事，極感興趣，前曾一度亟盼中央迅速改組，台灣省府之人士，頃亦稍現寗靜，彼等且信此事將在廿三日以後方可實現。台省警備總部今宣布，再將夜間戒嚴時間延遲一小時開始，俾使依賴夜市維持生計之人民獲得更多之活動時間。自該部公布暴動份子自新辦法後，聞台甫區內自首者頗衆，其中包括台南縣參議員陳海永等三十餘人，繳出之武器計有步槍八支機槍一挺，台南境內高山族人前曾協助國軍警戒防範暴徒竄入深山，彼等昨復允將現藏山地之高射機關砲三門，機槍六挺，步槍廿支，手槍七支及其他軍品彈藥送交當地駐軍。合北市米價今已稍跌，今年台省米榖可望豐收，新米一月後即可上市，合省南部區域天花流行，死亡日有所聞。</p>

<h3>美對華問題專家　論我國政府改組　謂民主精神受普遍祝賀</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十九日電〕華盛頓方面對中國國民政府羅致其他黨派人士及無黨無派人士所舉行之改組，以及蔣主席對中國共產黨之寬大為懷，一般均表示滿意·白宮方面迄米對中國聯合政府成立　作任何評論。代理國務卿艾克遜，會公開表示贊成參加中國政府之新份子，並稱此等人物，美國對之知之甚稔，且頗受美國人士之欽仰。白宮方面刻亦佇候國務卿自莫斯科之返國，而方可對中國新政府發出美國政府之正式反想。美國會極少數中國問題專家之一，衆議員楚德，於今日接見中央社記者謂，蔣主席以百折不撓之精神，繼續向前，使中國漸吿民主化之舉動，當受普遍之祝賀，楚德繼稱，南京方面本週所舉行之政府改組，業使美國人僉認蔣主席始終在人力可能範圍內努力力工作，俾使中國儘早走向改進政府及擴大政府之方向　所具之信念，得以證實。事實上楚德相信鑒於改變數千年來之旁王制度，成為一共和國之艱巨問題，蔣主席前進運動，實較任何有理性人士所預期為迅速也。楚德堅信，中國曾遭遇多數障碍，蓋中國過去曾遭日本之侵略，中國境內共產黨第五縱隊之暗中破壞，以及蘇聯共產主義，而又有西方國家之誤解及干涉。楚德以議諷語調，批評若干誣衊蔣主席一黨專政之人士謂，此等人士當頗染有紅色。楚德指責謂，此等批評人士，慣於使用「誣衊伎倆」以指責蔣主席一黨專政，顧彼等無能力為其自向奪取對政府之控制權也。楚德繼以詢問之語調稱，「是吾有任何其他國家曾派遺共產黨及其他少數黨派領袖出席舊金山聯合國大會。聞美國確未會派遺共產黨代表出席聯合國會議。余遍翻歷史，實難找出較蔣主席於改組及擴大中央政府一事，所表現之目光遠大，胸襟寬大，以及堅守正義精神更為偉大之例證。楚德擬籲請國會注意中國之一黨政府業吿結束，並要求國會諸領袖，應為中國而不應為蘇聯有所努力。美國調查國防計劃特別委會主席普魯斯特背中央社記者謂，渠對「在此一方向下，所作之進步甚表滿意，並希望此即表示美國將採取更為吿定之政策，以支持中國政府。」渠稱，華盛頓方面將採取更為肯定之政策，以支持中國政府。中央社記者並曾請求國會中號稱同情左派主要人士潑貝爾對中國政府改組事予以評論。渠拒加評論，僅稱，渠對此新政府尙未充份明暸，故目前未便作評，惟渠允許下週內將對中央社發表一正式聲明，然渠稱渠願盡力維持中美間之友情。某觀察家吿中央社記者謂，中國政府之新改組獲得充份瞭解時，美國對中國之同情將無疑變為更加實際，所不幸者，即目前僅有少數人士觀察此次改組之重要性，且僅有少數人士對最近諸發展予以注意也。據傳美對華貸款之將來發展，必俟馬歇爾返美後方有所決定。事實上，美對華政策，常必為馬歇爾所決定，蓋渠對華有密切之關聯，過去一週問美國諾政治家，曾忙於解決其本身之多數念迫問題。諸如勞工，立法，電話大罷工，最近貸款方案，得克薩斯爆炸案，世界救濟基金辯論，以及莫斯科會議諸問題也。</p>

<h3>英經濟學者週刋　讚揚我外交政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫教十九日電〕在英國甚有勢力之「經濟學者」週刋，今日刋長文一篇，分析中國之政治衝突，結論盛讚國民政府，雖應付內亂，然仍採取强硬之外交政策。國民政府高揚民族主義之大旗，同時當國民政府在國際塲合中，堅持中國之尊嚴時，幾已集合全國人民於其領導之下。該政府無殊在堅決抗議四外長會議討諭中國內政時，已獲一切有政治感之中國人民之支持，惟最瘋狂之共黨份子為例外。該週刋復指稱，中國政府對菲律賓政府及印尼政府對華僑之歧視措施，亦已採取强硬方針。此種保障華僑之力量，可足證內亂並未使中國在國際方面陷入無力量地位。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十九日電〕美衆議員孟斯菲爾特頃晤記者稱，目前中國政府之改組，實屬走向正確方向之一步驟。彼稱，中國政府之擴大基礎，表示蔣主席欲使政府成為更具代表全中國人民性質之政府。彼論及張羣為行政院長時稱，此項人選極佳，彼不能想出較彼於戰爭初年奉羅斯福命來華而過及之前四川省主席張羣更卓越之目領。彼對孫科亦有同感。</p>

<h3>莫斯科會議的最後關頭</h3>
<p>莫斯科四國外長會議自三月十日開幕以來，忽已一個多月了。在這四十天的時期內，只見航空俱樂部內波瀾迭起，屏槍舌劍，爭辯不已；而對於四强在會議前所預定的工作程序，不但寸步未栘，毫無進展；而且事到如今，外長會議大有不歡而散的可能了。據法國新聞界莫斯科十九日電，一般觀察家，咸預料莫斯科會議，將於明後日（廿二日或廿三日）閉幕，而至七月內重開外長會議。前幾天早盛感傳美國國務卿馬歇爾與英國外相貝文均將於下星期內離蘇返國；今天又傳英法兩國代表團已作離去的初步準備；就是在蘇聯外長莫洛托夫經過四十天的舌戰，也已感覺到唇焦舌敝了。以上所傳的消息如果事實，則不但對德和約的基本要點不能商獲協議，而且對奧和約，因為奧境德產問題及南國對奧要求不能解決，也沒有在莫斯科簽字的希望了。四强對於德國問題未能成立協議，對於今後的國際局勢雖有嚴重的影響，但各方在會議之前早已料及，而對奧和約的不能在莫期科簽字成立，在心理上給世人的打擊，實在太大了。</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥自中國返美就任國務鄉之後，就潛心研究戰後的國際局勢，尤其是美鮮之間的關係；深知其癥結之所在，毅然決然，前往莫斯科，出席四國外長會議，欲藉其軍事上的韜略及政治上的智慧，能替戰後和平透露出一終陽光來。所以在媽帥赴莫斯科之前，對於此行早已抱着三大目的：（一）商定對德和約之要點，決定召開對德和會的日期；（二）在莫斯科簽署對奧和約；（三）締結四强公約，保證德國解除武裝不致再起侵略。不過馬帥默察世界大勢，也知道其任務的不易完成，所以馬帥在赴蘇途中，曾發表談話稱：『四國外長會議的工作，殊極困難，對德和約未必能在會議期問，草擬完成；此次會議之目的，僅在就對德和約之基本要點，獲致協議而已；此項目的若能達到，則余將不勝愉快矣』。由此說來，外長會議的「一事無成」，早就在馬帥的意料之中。</p>
<p>我們再看馬帥在這四千天的會議中，無處不抱着沉着應變的態度，終想使這次外長會議，不致於「徒勞無功」。起初馬帥終是保守緘默，靜聽英法蘇三國外長的高談關論，非至重要關頭或爭論不下的時候馬帥始一變械默態度，發表其論據；這種作風的用意，無非想使外長會議順利進行而已。但是馬帥的能度，並未能轉變會議的空氣，才其是草洛托夫外長始終監持成見，不肯稍讓。及至美國提出締結四强公約的建議，蘇聯竟提出修正案，使其根本不能成立時，馬帥不得不另覺蹊徑，企圖打開美蘇間的僵局，乃要求與史丹林直接會晤，但是史馬二帥會談的結果，又未能發生新的作用，使外長會議的僵局仍無法打開。所以，馬帥在莫斯科外長會議中，確已盡了他最大的努力；打不開會議的僵局，當能視為馬帥外交的失敗。</p>
<p>我們綜合四强在四十天來所發表之意見，可知四強意見的紛歧，實在已到了頂點：（一）關於解除德國武裝及淸理德國戰爭潛力問題，蘇聯攻擊英美佔領當局未能遵守波茨坦協定的規定，切實解除德國武裝及摧毀德國戰爭潛力；英國外相對蘇聯反唇相議，馬帥也替盟國管制委員會辯護。（二）關於肅淸德國納粹餘孽使其政治民主化問題，美國主張四國佔領區應採用同樣之辦法；法國雖表示同意，但認為德國政治須先民主化始能肅淸納粹餘孽；此在英蘇兩國外長，則互相指摘，互相攻訐；（三）關於德國賠償問題，蘇聯要求德國賠償一萬萬美元，並須自德國現行生產中提取賠款；英美堅決反對；法國在原則上表示贊成，（四）關於德國經濟統一問題，蘇聯主張統一甚力，並要求英美取消兩佔領區在經濟上實行合併所簽訂之協定；法國則以增加德國煤斤輸入法闕之數量為接受德國經濟統一的條件。（五）關於德國中央政體問題，英美主張德國採取聯邦制，但蘇聯贊成德國成為單一國。（六）關於德國流亡人民的安插間題，法國以為權國人口已經非常稠密，不許人民繼續移往德國，凡非德人均不得留居德國境內；英國則表示異議。（七）關於魯爾區問題，蘇聯主張由四強共管，英國要求四强共管的辦法，應遍及整個德國；此在法國則要求在魯爾區成立特別政體，又為英國所反對。（八）關於德國邊疆問題，美國提將上西里西亞歸彼蘭管轄，而德國東陲被波蘭佔領的地方。仍歸還德國。奠洛托夫監持德波邊界應依照波茨坦協定劃分。當然表示反對英法一致認為：「德國的疆界，在第一次大戰後，過於向東；而第二次大戰後，將過分向西了。」（九）關於四强公約的問題，英美法三國一致贊成，但莫洛托夫提出修正案，使其無法成立（十）關於對奧和約問題，一切問題都已解決，但是奧境德產問題，美蘇意見完全相反，蘇聯的主張，無異要奧國負担些賠償。（十一）關於召開對德和會問題『美國主張應依照聯合國憲章之精神，凡曾對德官戰之各國，均應參加對德和會，惟在和會表決時，應將各國分為有資格投票者與無資格投票者兩類。蘇聯對此則表示異議。</p>
<p>由上所述，可知美蘇爭議的梗概了。我們站在第三者，平心而論，美蘇對於如何收拾這個戰敗的德國？不論在原則上或在意識上都是一致的，並沒有不同的地方；大家都要解除德國的武裝，肅淸德國的納粹勢力，使其政治民主化，不復能東山再起，威脅歐洲的和平與安全；如果美蘇均能以和平為重，而不斤斤以自己的利益是求，則外長會議討論這些問題，都不難獲致協議的。但是現在所以爭論不已，甚至將使會議陷於僵局，這完全是四強成見太深的綠故，尤其美蘇兩國的積不相容。我們放眼看世界，不僅在莫斯科的天際，為陰霾所籠罩着；而且在美蘇兩國之間，也充滿了疑雲慘霧、這幾天來，安全理事會討論美國援助希土爾國的計劃，使成功湖畔也已成為陰沉沉的世界了。所以美蘇兩國的互相猜忌，互相疑懼，實為今日世界的一大悲劇；戰後和平的不易實現，其根本原因就在此；莫斯科會議陷於僵局的原因，也就在此。故莫斯科的觀察家說，唯有美蘇意見突然接近，始能使外長會議繼續開下去，否則就要不歡而散了。所以我們希望美蘇兩國的政治外交家，在尙未不歡而散之前，迅速運用政治智慧，撥開莫斯科天際的陰雲，替和平透露出一綫陽光來。</p>
<p>要之，莫斯科外長會議，已至最後的關頭，成功或失敗，在下週內即可分曉；全世界愛好和平的人們，都舉首望着莫斯科，盼望四國外長散播一些和平的消息，切莫再使他們失望了。</p>

<h3>對奧和約序文雖獲通過　外長會議不容樂觀　四強對南國要求意見懸殊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿日電〕莫斯科本日廣播稱：對奧和約之整個序文，已由外長會議在星期日上午會議時予以通過。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科二十日廣播：四外長今日雨次討論對奧和約，獲得一種協議。莫洛托夫原係堅持毋須提出證據即可在奧逮捕戰爭嫌疑犯，但今已放棄此項主張。英美法外長認爲在奧逮捕戰犯應先提出證據，莫洛托夫現已同意此點。除此以外，所有其他重要條文，均未有協議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科二十日電〕今日外長會議，從和約中開始逐一討論剩餘之八項條款，再度商討整個和約，除戰犯一點外，對於其他任何要點，均未成立協議。四外畏原定今日舉行之第二次會議，臨時取消，俾外長代表得機會有進行工作，但同意明日會議兩次，晨間將討論特里埃斯特經濟報吿，午後聽取代表提出有關奧國之報吿。四外長又商妥奧國和約，不用正式德文本，此係法外長皮社爾所提議，其餘三外長均謂，對此「並無强烈感覺」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十日廣播：英美法外長已拒絕南斯拉夫向奧大利索取領士之要求，三外長認爲卡林西亞不應屬於南斯拉夫。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕外長會議今日討論南斯拉夫對奧國之士地要求，未有協議，乃決定交外次會繼續硏究，於星期一提出報吿。四外長爲加緊討論起見，決定破例於明日星期日長晚召開會議兩次，南斯拉夫之要求，僅獲莫洛托夫一人之支持。當論及南國向奧要求賠償時，貝文外相曾透露波茨坦會議決定不得向奧要求賠償之秘密史料，當時蘇代表會提出建議，要求自一九四五年起之六年內，由奧國賠償價値二億五千萬元之工業生產品，給予英美蘇南四國，時爲一九四五年七月二十四日。然彼茨坦會議之經濟委員會第一次接獲該議，並未成立協議，其後復由英美蘇三國外長在波茨坦硏究此事，然後又轉呈邱吉爾·史達林·杜魯門三巨頭，卒由三巨頭成立決議，同意不得向奧要求賠償，並在波茨坦協定中予以明文規定。莫洛托夫仍要求考慮南國對奧之要求，皮社爾在原則上贊成英美之建議，但渠又聲明法國並未參加波茨坦會議，然渠頗爲南國外長星期四所陳之意見所感動，故渠覺不知是吾可以撤銷對奧條約第四十五條，以滿足南斯拉夫之要求，該條規定聯合國境內之奧國財產或淸理此等財產之所得應歸還奧國。皮杜爾認爲南國在戰爭時期，受奧人之破壞甚劇，或可因前項條文之撤銷而獲得少許補償。至於法國，則仍擬交還其境內之奧國財產，想其他聯合國亦準備如此。最後議決將對奧條約第四十五條依皮杜爾建議之方式交林次會硏究。四外長繼討論奧國之疆界，英美法贊成保留德國併奧前之奧國國界，而莫洛托夫則支持南斯拉夫對卡林西亞省一部份土地之要求，馬歇爾表示決不可接受南斯拉夫之要求，以免嚴重破壞奧國之經濟。</p>
<h3>傳四國外長會議　將於本週內閉幕　下次會議或將於七月間召開</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十九日電〕此間觀察家頃談稱：四國外長會議，殆將於本月廿二日或廿三日閉幕，至本年七月間舉行召開。若干觀察家作此項預言，係基於英法兩國代表團刻正爲返國作初步準備，例如，莫斯科大飯店之以前房客業已接　通知，可望於四月廿五日左右，可遷返該飯店居住。目下僅美國代表團之要員，仍抱樂觀態度，或佯拘樂觀能度，並謂，四國外長將繼績開會二三星期之久。但欲使四國外長會議將延長其會期，必須有一大奇蹟出現，即：（一）美蘇兩國對於四强公約之觀點，能趨於接近；（二）蘇聯希望自德國四部現行工業生產提取賠償，能與英美希望德國工業恢復以减輕其負責獲得妥協，否則決無延會希望。美國國務卿馬歇爾本日會作最後努力，企圖試探出蘇聯之意向，但蘇聯對於奧國邊界問題及賠償問題，仍不顧三國外長之意見，堅持成見，不肯稍讓。馬帥現已完全明瞭蘇聯不能讓步，甚至不惜使對奧和約不能在莫斯科簽字。要之，莫斯科外長會議勢將休會，對於馬帥實爲一大失敗，其錯誤所在，乃因馬帥對於蘇聯所不能讓步之問題（賠償問題及德波邊界問題），正面向蘇聯攻擊。有以致之云。</p>
<h3>史達林接見　南國副總理</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十九日電〕莫斯科廣播電台頃發出消息稱：史達林元帥本日接見南斯拉夫內閣副總理卡台爾，有所商談，南國駐蘇聯大使波波維區及蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，時均在座。</p>
<h3>德煤斤出口問題　英美法將締協定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十九日電〕頃悉：英美法三國對於德國境英美法三國佔領區煤斤出口問題，即將締結協定，但該項協定並不在四國外長會議討論範圍之內</p>
<h3>眞理報聲明</h3>
<p>吾認蘇欲離間英美關係</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿日電〕一眞理報」今日吾認蘇聯建議在修正後之英蘇盟約內應附一款，使英國與美國脫離連繫。（按本社上星期曾發表紐約時報所載之報吿，並由本社外交記者加以評論，謂修改英蘇盟約談判進展之遲緩，已使倫敦人士懷疑蘇聯之提出條約問題，目的或不在聯防德國之侵略，而在限制英國與他國接觸。）「眞理報」斥此種揣測爲可笑而無意養。該報謂：根據可靠方面，蘇聯之建議並不具有此等條款，　蘇聯從未反對英國與美國或法國樹立友好關係，故殊無附訂此項條款之必要。英美或英法之合作，若非針對蘇聯，則蘇聯甚表贊成。蘇聯人民深信各强國間之友好條約，均應禁止訂約國之一參加不利於對方訂約國之集團，固不論此項參加係置於何種掩飾方式之下云。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞大使大美演說　暢論聯合國機構　對德和約爭論不決殊堪憂慮</h3>
<p>〔聯合社費拉台爾菲亞十九日電〕中國川席聯合國機構代表顧維鈞大使，今日在美國政治及科學學院發表演說稱，聯合國機構中並無思想集團存在，惟猜疑在所不免。實際上聯合國機構中之淮一集團，厥爲心存猜疑之輩，對於任何問題常一致投票。惟和平爲每個國家所注意，故聯合國機構之前途充滿希望。予不信經過最近戰爭之任何國家有不願和平者。世界之安定，國際營備隊之設立，以及裁减軍備與原子管制等問題，全賴德日兩國和約能談判成功。惟對德和約旣爭辯未決，對日和約猶尙待磋商，不安與誤會之思想因此將瀰漫於世界各地。對前途之信心雖未完全動搖，亦已遭受限制。此種警誠態度，尤其在聯合國機構領導各國，雖不致阻礙聯合國之主要工作，亦將使其進行遲緩。</p>
<h3>伊拉克謀恢復　薩達巴特條約</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕自英國政府宣佈將英軍逐漸自伊拉克撤退之後，伊拉克內閣總理約布爾已與土耳其伊朗以及阿富汗三國進行談判，討論恢復一九三七年之薩達巴特條約事宜。此問政界人士認爲伊拉克此舉，可以目爲伊拉克如遇困難，則意欲依賴美國之表示。但此項計劃似為蘇聯所不滿。</p>
<h3>美外交轉趨積極　具有撲減共產主義決心</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦甘日電〕星期泰晤士報華盛頓訪員稱：吾人有充分理由可資相信國務院亦即整個杜魯門政府正從事進行大規模之外交行動，以應付全世界之共產主義。對於草斯科會議之失望，以及參議院之即將通過援助希士案，將引起加緊之美國外交政策，輔以空前規模之貸款，以供給他國以製成品及糧食。援助希土計劃，或將將於星期二由參院通過。根據現定計劃，更大數額之對韓貸款，將緊接繼之推動，以後將更有其他借款。美政府於要求國會通過此等援助計劃時，將力言世界之需要美國大量援助，以撲滅共產主義。國務院深知美國之生產商亦急需國外市塲。代理國務卿艾克遜對於反共政策全力支持，援助希臘案之辯論，已使美國外交政策之眞謹充分明朋化。蘇聯亦已知美國確實具有反共至少防共之眞意。若參院於星期二通過援助希土案，距杜魯門總統之提議僅四十一日。衆議院不久亦可通過此案。依國會常例言，手續不得不謂迅速。此外杜魯門總統並已建議廢止中立法，凡比均可表示美國外交之轉向積極云。</p>
<h3>就美國援助希土方案　郭泰祺發表見解　認為美國此舉無損聯合國威望</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十八日電〕我代表郭泰祺在聯合國安理會所發表之聲明，要點如下：余以中國代表之地位，願對美國代表就所建議之援助希土二國計劃，略有所言，幷向理事會表明敝國代表團對兩項建議之立塲。一般認爲討論中之援助計劃，單獨由美國從事，而不通過聯合國，且將有損聯合國之聲威。余願於此指出者，即此偉大民主國之大衆及美國之報紙，首先對其政府政策作如是之枇評，余必須言者，即美國政體之健全與美國民主之有效功能，予余印象至深。安理會自當樂於在三月十二日杜魯門總統建議援希計劃之當時，或其前，獲得美代表之通知，余以中國代表之地位而言，余認爲美代表援希土法案成爲法律以前，三月二十八日提交安理會以關於援助計劃之綜合報吿，是項計劃，美政府認爲係援助希土二國，此舉極具重要意義。中國代表團歡迎此項聲明，其本身已明白表示美國並未有意不通渦聯合國而採取行動，余以爲有國際貸款或國際性質之計劃，為安理會或聯合國就大體而論並未獲得通知者，就余所知，美國乃在安理會作此種聲明之第一個會員國。</p>
<h3>美丹友好條約　在繼續談判中</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿日電〕關於丹麥要求廢除一九四一年美丹所訂關於格林蘭基地之協定，外傳美國政府已予拒絕一說，此間丹麥大使館發言人頃加以否認，並謂友好談判現仍在進行中，希望美國能於一九四八年起開始完全退出格林蘭各基地。按該項協定乃規定美國在格林蘭有駐軍之權。</p>
<h3>莫斯科將建築　摩天樓八所</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十九日電〕此間將興建摩天大　，所需鋼骨，正在茅聶伯羅彼得羅夫斯克之莫洛托夫工廠內製造。依照莫斯科之發展計劃，將建築二十二層之摩天大樓一所，二十六層者二所，十六層者五所。</p>
<h3>華萊士抵挪威</h3>
<p>〔聯合社挪威京城十九日電〕美國前副總統華萊士原擬在此發表演說一次，現已擴天爲四次講壇演說及一次廣播演說。華氏今日在此大受歡迎，被稱爲「平民最重要的呼聲之一」，此言乃戰時那維古市長布洛克所發，布氏與挪威敎育部長福斯脫伏爾聯合設宴歡迎華氏，全國六大黨代表均三加，包括閣員兩人在內。福氏稱，華氏能使保守派基督敎黨，勞動人民黨，農民黨與共產黨代表共處一座，乃爲唯一之成就。華氏演詞中力言美國任何法律，凡制止美國人在外國公開批評本國政府者，應加　改，俾與聯合國文化敎育科學機構之憲章相符。華氏提及美國方面有人提議撤銷華氏之出國護照，並援用羅根法案對之制裁一事，華氏稱，「全世界任何公民吐露眞言，不過爲宣行文敎機構憲章之規定。余相信任何美國法律凡與此項憲章相抵觸者，常加以修正。」席間宣讀美國農會來電，促請華萊士奮鬥不已，並擔保絕大多數美國人正與華氏表共鳴。同時巴黎方面法國左翼政治家即前空軍部長谷特已來電歡迎華氏以「老友」資格而不以任何政黨之代理人資格訪法。</p>
<h3>荷總理視察印尼</h3>
<p>〔路透社海牙十九日電〕荷蘭總理貝爾，殖民部長容克曼，可望於本月二十九日啓程赴巴達雜亞視察，在印尼將有一週之勾留</p>
<h3>美國遠東政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕不問馬歇爾之恢復朝鮮統一談判建議是否能爲莫洛托夫所接受，美國決計執行其以五億至六億美元援助朝鮮之計劃，如若朝鮮之統一能完成，則援助之對象當爲整個朝鮮而非限於朝鮮之南部。美國之計劃雖含有復興南部之心理戰爭之因素，然如若朝鮮能統一，則是項心理上之武器即爲不必需者，而援助朝鮮之計劃仍將履行。蓋朝鮮不問其爲統一或分裂，深需是項援助也。馬歇爾要求蘇方解決朝鮮問題之建議非常合時。如莫洛托夫能表同意，則美國即能獲得其所希望獲得者，即朝鮮之統一。如蘇方之回答不能表示在最近之將來有解決之望，則馬歇爾將加　請求國會撥款作經濟戰，以防止共產主義在遠東之擴張。美國對印尼共和國之政策在最近一星期內亦頓趨重要，若千國務院官員提議「有限度承認」印尼共和國，此事如有結果，則，可約略窺知美國在東南亞之政策。對漸將獨立之緬甸，美國堅持其一貫政策，即同情反法西斯領袖。美國將盤谷之公使館升級爲大使館，亦表示美國）對暹羅之更趨重視。杜魯門總統在本星期接見暹羅大使時稱，渠希望該地能有和平之政府以確保人民之安全與繁榮。國務院對日和約之準備工作亦已屆決定階段，至今仍由專家委員在詳細討論專門之經濟政治等問題，然僉信不久即可向其他盟國正式提出。據官方估計對日和會可在本年秋季，可能在十月問召開。</p>
<h3>美參議院堅決反對　租借物資繼續運蘇　指責政府政策矛盾之點</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十九日合衆電〕美參院對國務院欲再予蘇聯租借物品事已予駁回，撥款委會主席勃里奇堅決反對國務院此舉謂，國會之通過，勢必經由參院撥款委會提出後始可，而此項發展，乃屬未必。參院議長范登堡稱，在蘇聯戰時租借物資一百一十二億九千七百萬美元事尙未解決前，不應再有租借物資運往蘇聯。常時參院係指責政府一面以援助希土計劃，阻止共黨，一面復又對蘇供給物資而協助共黨。參院定廿二日表決援助希土案問題。</p>
<h3>英公主伊麗莎白誕辰</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿日電〕廿一日爲王儲伊麗莎白公主廿一歲誕辰日，聖寳羅大敎堂將鳴鐘誌慶。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕英公主伊麗莎白至星期一已滿足廿一歲，自畢卡狄萊的夜總會至威爾斯各破區，英不搖唇鼓舌，以公主誔辰爲談助。一般人尤亟欲知道她二十二歲的一年將是如何情形，結婚嗎？獲得新僞位嗎？自覺宮室嗎？我們可從無數自命知道的人得到「是」和「吾」的答復，都是十分肯定，衹有內閣和自金漢宮却並不談起。公主滿廿一歲，已有結婚的資格，據傳她和前希團王子蒙巴頓海軍中尉的婚約，俟她成年以後即可宣布，但在南非的王室中人却說並無此事。接近白金漢宮者對於英王喬治將以新爵位賜給伊麗莎白公主之說，亦認爲不足置信。</p>

<h3>虞洽卿遺產　受買人之謎　成都路地產十二畝　出售後弟弟兄起爭執</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前本市商界鉅子虞洽卿，於民國卅四年春在渝亡故後，迄今已將二載，虞氏生前在滬之鉅額造產，方今正由「遺產整理委員會」整理時，近忽發生一耐人尋味之產權糾紛。雙方各委託律師在報上刋登啓事廣吿，相互攻計，記者向雙方探得詳情，爰彙誌如次：</p>
<p>虞洽老有子三人，長名順恩，次名順懋，三名順慰。抗戰後期，虞氏去內地後，在滬財產事業，悉由順恩經管順恩經營，不幸洽老即於日寇投降一年前之春季，病故重慶。勝利後治老之遺產繼承人即組織「遺產整理委員會」以處理所有遺產。月前長兄順恩向「整理會」報吿，謂有靜安寺路成都路地產二起，共計十二畝零六厘六毫，及所有建築物，業已於本年二月初售於一姓虞名順淵之地產商，價共黄金一百五十八條（每條十兩），其中並扣去利息二十絛（因前有借款），佣金七絛。順懋。順慰以該項產業係共有財產，長兄不能單獨處分，且因該項房地產時値黄金千條以上，而順恩克以十分之一之賤價出售，且受買人又名「虞曠淵」，因而懷疑，以爲「處順淵」或為順恩之化名，買賣行爲，亦係順恩所弄之玄虛，乃委託姜屛藩，端木愷，李潮年三律師代表在報上刋登啓事，聲明該項房地產產權係三人共有，非經共有人全體同意，不得轉移或說定負担。翌日有洪士豪律師代表虞順淵，駁覆及聲明所有權啓事。在報端發現。據洪律師吿記者稱：虞順淵係武進人，經營地產已數十年，確有其人，決非他人故意虛設之化名，該項房地產之出賣人爲處順恩，且在產業憑證上或登記之手續上，旣未列有虛順懋·虞順慰之姓名，亦無關關於共有權之記載，且經虞順恩書面聲明：「確係自產自賣，並無房族或第三者任何權利上之糾葛。」並稱：至於虞順懋·虞順慰懷疑虞順淵係虞順恩之化名，實爲愚笨之猜測，蓋設若虛順恩化名頂替，何不另造其他姓氏，偏欲用「虞順」二字，而招致懷疑，豈有如此不智者。虞順淵實爲一毫不相千之第二者，僅姓名巧合而已，今雖僅由順懋·順慰出面干涉，然對買買經過，何以知之綦詳，實不能不令人懷疑其爲沆　一氣，三弟兄竟圖推翻業已完成之買賣云云。但據虞順懋·順慰一方面稱：「虞順淵」者，必無其人，所謂武進之籍貫，乃指浙江興業銀行中之虞某，虞某亦係案中一重大關係人，因此項房地產之買賣，彼係原經手人，一眞順淵」之通訊，亦可由其轉交，彼曾吿人稱：此項產業係一法國神父託彼化名代購云云。</p>
<p>本案究係眞正之產權糾紛，抑爲一變相之遺產料紛，記者無從獲悉，唯虞順恩曾在順懋，順慰兩兄弟前起誓罰咒，聲明確有此項買賣，而順慰，順懋二人堅決表示不能放棄該項房地產之所有權，現正由江一平律師，以大姊丈身份在兩者之間調停，暫時可不致涉訟。</p>

<p>播講時之潘氏（本報攝）</p>
<h3>潘公展播講　新聞與廣告　本報昨舉行第三次星期廣播</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報於昨日假座亞美麟記電台，舉辦第三次星期日特別廣播，原請黨國元老吳稚暉氏講演，因吳氏有事未能蒞臨，由本報社長潘公展播講「新聞與廣吿」，茲誌其演詞全文如下：</p>
<p>「一般人把報紙的內容分成新聞與廣吿兩部門，廣吿的收入可以維持新聞事業，新聞的力量可以吸收廣吿，這兩者是互相爲用的，但是我們深一層的看，普通人認爲廣吿僅不渦是商業上吸引顧客的一種工具，站在報紙的立塲講，廣吿也是新聞。舉一個例，某大公司大減價的廣吿，它把物品的種類，廉價的情形，供給顧客的參考和選撑，這就是新聞。再舉一個例，有人把股票，契約遺失了，登報聲明作廢，表面看純粹是廣吿，實際上也是新聞，因爲看到這種廣吿，你不至於買進失去效用的東西，而受到不必要的損失，這種廣吿已經有了新聞的作用。因爲廣告影響的重大，所以我們對於廣告的內容，可能發生的效果和價値，應該與新聞同樣的重視。</p>
<p>接受委登廣告　先必加以審查</p>
<p>報館接到廣吿之後，先要審査它的內客是不是確實的，正確的，有沒有欺騙讀者，給予讀者惡劣的印象地方。不是說無論什麽廣吿，只要有廣吿費就刋登的。登了一則欺騙讀者的廣吿，其所給與讀者的影響，和刋載一條不正確的新聞是一樣的。報紙是同樣要負責的，申報就是抱的這種精神，它有七十餘年的歷史，對於刋登廣吿一向是非常審愼的。欺騙續者的廣吿，即使出十倍的廣吿費，我們也不登的。我們對於廣吿的價値的看法，不是從它的地位的大小，以及地位的優劣，刋登的先後來做標準的，我們是以它對文化上敎育上的影響如何爲標準的。由於嚴格的限制，收入方面最初自然要受到損失，不過時間久了之後，在社會間建立起信用，公司商店工廠也樂於刋登受人重視的廣吿，則結果必能得到其應有的報酬。</p>
<p>許多新聞之中　亦有廣告效用</p>
<p>反過來講：新聞也有廣吿的效用。因爲登出一條新聞是不容易的，報紙篇幅有限，以本報而論，每天兩張半報紙，除去廣吿之外，餘下的篇幅，要刋載國內外新聞，眞是經緯萬端，不勝枚舉，所以每一條新聞都是經過愼重選擇，不是隨便登出來的。而一經刋出之後，假如銷十萬份報紙，平均十個人看一份報，就有一百萬人看到，銷二十萬份報，就有二百萬人看到，等於替某件事情做了義務廣告，這就是新聞收了廣吿的效果。例如政府公佈的命令或法律，這是廣吿，但也可以用新聞的形式發表。一般的公司商店工廠想在篇幅有限的報紙上登出一條新聞是很不容易的，但是似如有這樣一個不著名的小商店，它的貨品的確是價廉物美，一個不著名的小工廠，它的出品的確是貨眞價實，我們的報紙是樂於為其宣傳。</p>
<p>為讀者着想　為社會服務</p>
<p>幷不是爲一個商店一個工廠宣傳，而是爲社會服務，爲讀者着想，雖然公司商店工廠沒有委託刋登廣吿，我們也要負起報道的責任的。本報一心一意就是爲讀者服務，先使新聞與廣吿合而爲一，再藉廣播的力量，使讀者，聽衆，以及公司商店工廠合而爲一，對於社會的生產與消費兩方面，期能因申報的服務而受到益處，這是我們對於社會的一點貢獻。」</p>
<h3>名票藝員薈萃　美具難併節目精彩</h3>
<p>昨爲本報第三次星期日特別廣播，其中平劇節目，異常精彩，除名票范石人君及其夫人之全本桑園會，朱聖淸小姐托兆碰碑，沈柏年君之生死恨外，臨時復承名藝員趙桐珊君播唱春香閳學，（由笛王許百遒君撅笛）菊社名票吳滬生小姐宇宙鋒，富榮華小姐十道本，（言派）顧文芍君貴妃醉酒，何時希君張哲生君羣英會打蓋。此次又承名鼓師魏希雲君打鼓，及名羣師富葆菁，當雲亮昆仲操琴，爲本報廣播帮忙，尤爲美具難併。平劇後爲崑曲，張元和，在一　兩小姐之紅梨記亭會，趙景深君及夫人李希同女士之琵琶記盤夫，方英達小姐紅梨記一訪素，沈柏年君刺虎，殷菊儂小姐邯椰夢之掃花三醉，吳濟川君琴挑，趙景深君喬醋，汪一　小姐樓會，殷菊儂小姐及顧太太合唱長生殿小宴，至十二時始畢。</p>
<h3>大都市貼隣·小小上海縣　新舊縣長移交　現款祇剩卅萬　貧困阻塞了地方發展</h3>
<p>〔本報專訪〕上海縣和上海市，在字面上雖祗一字之差，其在形式和實質上，直有天壤之別。上海縣雖然緊繁依傍着上海市，但無論在那一方面說，它和內地一般鄉鎭一樣，還停滯在落後的階段中。</p>
<p>上海縣是江蘇省中最小的一個縣份，它現有的總面積雖有二十五萬畝之多，就全縣人口和收入說，不及上海市的一個最小的「區」，這使人意識着上海市的一個區長，事實上，就等於一個州長。</p>
<p>上海縣政府，處於南市外六十華里的閔行鎭，記者昨日趨車往訪，沿途菜花遍地，綠柳絲絲，離開市塵，頓感神爽。閔行鎭的市區很小，兩條主要　區，窄狹不堪，市面簫條，滿眼一片凄凉景色。八年抗戰之餘，上海縣人民的一般副業，是用最原價的勞力，爲上海市火柴商罰製造火柴盒。一千個火柴盒的價錢是三千元，中間人不折不扣的坐享了二分之一，辛勤的工作者實得祇一千五百元，還得白備漿糊。「先生，自早到晚，一天能做一千個火柴盒已經不容易了！」他們說。但是農村中多的是過剩的勞力，大家搶着這筆廉價的生意。</p>
<p>縣鎭的物價，跟着上海市走，如臂使指，靈敏異常。這幾天閔行的白粳也在十八萬元大關上下　動。在這裏找不出有什麽比上海便宜的東西，只有一般鄉村特有的鷄蛋，還只買三百元一個。整批的土布，因為沒有大銷路，布商們坐在那裏打盹。</p>
<p>午間，記者到縣立中學和山心國民學校去訪問。縣中校長薛惠康是地方上有聲望的老敎育界，他見到記者，親切的像會到了知音，一把拉着我去參觀他所難苦支持着的殘破的敎室和學生們的宿舍與飯廳。敎師和學生一樣的站立在那裏吃素餐。敎師每月祗三十幾萬元的薪水，已經欠薪兩個月。據說全縣各項薪餉都是如此，前任縣長倪有祥走了，留下一位財政科長辦移交。新縣長視事，接受現款祗三十萬元。大家都知道現在縣政經費收入少，無法向新縣長討債，只好耐着等。</p>
<p>新縣長兪月秋，過去是同濟大學的敎授，本月二日到縣親事。他正面對着前任縣長欠下的債務發愁。對於將來的收支如何求其平衡，正在和地方人士計劃着。據兪兪縣長說：上海縣全年田賦收入是九萬萬餘元，各種稅收每月共約二千餘萬元。其中百分之五十分繳中央與省政府，百分之五十（約四萬萬元）留給地方使用。全縣保安隊一百三十餘人，每人薪餉不足一萬元，警察八十餘人，月餉二萬元，爲了地方治安，正擬訓練義務警察，並加强自衛隊的組織。最近在縣境三林塘與陳行間，發現小量股匪搶刦，正在淸剿中。全縣十二萬人中，有烟民二百多人，定於本年六月一日舉行總檢査，順便整編保甲，淸査戶口。其他在地政，社會，敎育，建說，衛生等方面，兪縣長把他的計劃都依次作了詳盡的說明，說到頭，一句話，收入太少，實際做起來，難免打折扣。</p>
<p>從另外幾個地方人士口中獲悉，他們想在田賦稅收之外，每畝增加二角的附收稅，來帮助縣政的推行。這個提案，將在縣參議會中提出來討論。</p>
<p>上海縣的問題·像中國目前各地的情形一樣「窮」。財力物力的窮困阻礙了地方事業的發展。</p>
<h3>拆買鮮肉起衝突　夥計揮斧砍同業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華山路小菜塲，昨日上午芷當上市之際，有擺設鮮肉攤之李德昌，因所有猪肉已吿售罄，乃向隣近殷福生所設之肉攤，拆買鮮肉三十餘斤，過秤時，因斤量不足，發生口角，　起衝突，時般攤上之夥計名股國淸者，竟將斬肉斧向李頭部砍去，李因躱避迅速未中，詎旁立同業彭正林，猝不及防，左肩被中一斧，當即受傷倒地，鮮血直流，旋經人召崗警到來，將行兇人拘獲，帶局偵訊，並將受傷者車送保　醫院醫治。</p>

<h3>曾充敵憲密探　陷害鄕民父子　李孝思遊園被捕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕寳山人胡子孝，卅四歲，業印刷生意，現在成都北路七七九弄五五號供職，胡之伯父桂岩，寓居寳山楊溪鄉保家樓地方，務農爲業，薄有資產。民廿九年五月某日，突被會充敵憲密探之同鄉李孝思（四十一歲），因敲詐不遂，誣吿桂岩及其子子乾，指爲重慶份子，嚮導日憲兵，將父子兩人拘去。迨至翌晨黎明六時許，發現胡父子屍體兩具，被殺於保家樓屋角荒塲上。當時家屬因畏其勢，無可奈何，勝利後，由胡子孝具狀控於寳山縣政府，惟因李逃往外埠，終未弋獲。昨日上午十一時半，李栔領姘婦謝金妹，在外難花園徘徊，被胡子孝撞見，遂鳴到二七六七號崗警，將彼倆一併拘入黄浦警局，經偵訊後，案情大白，因犯罪地點係屬寳山縣轄境，將提回歸案究辦。</p>

<p>昨雙方演出俱佳，令人滿意，華聯松圓獨進十八分，功不可沒，成章奪球，學崇衝刺，廣益遠投與相成之保守，均各有所長，汕隊立德維聰演雄，昨晚動作敏捷，淸江之前後照顧，燦希之阻爛，雖以二分之差，功虧一簣，亦有幸有不幸耳。</p>
<p>華聯力戰　一分佔先</p>
<p>賽前攝影記者大忙攝影記者大忙，兩隊各拍後，復合拍，華聯拍入鏡頭者祇六人，李震中倚牆，在「欣賞技術請守秩序」之體育館標語下，靜觀欣賞。</p>
<p>七時半準時開始，爭奪不久，汕隊林維聰射中的，何立德左邊突破，即高懸四分。華聯阿孔學祟等屢試不入，包松圓籃下托進，不料蔡演雄單手命中，華聯呌休，笛聲起處，陳淸江於百忙中在籃前跳起擲進，觀衆皆呼之曰『怪球。』阿弟學崇相繼建功，汕隊仍以八比六領前，但亦欲暫停以挫對方銳氣，老包罰球單手推入，學祟接連一球，華聯九比八超出一分。</p>
<p>形勢緊張上半結束</p>
<p>阿孔鎭定遠投，林雜聰報以顏色，孔舊地重遊，包增一球，十五比十汕隊落後五分，相成淸江學崇罰球均無虛發，何立德推門姿勢擲中，阿孔第三只遠投，老包演雄維聰競爭投籃，汕隊又暫停，去上半時僅三秒鐘，結果仍爲廿三比十七，華聯緊張狀態下佔先六分。</p>
<p>汕隊猛攻三分超出</p>
<p>休息再戰，汕隊紀南康替維聰，何立德立首功，對方老包罰中，轉瞬間淸江立德阿蔡二擲一罰增五分（廿五十廿四），華聯祗多一分，包罰中，蔡投入，形勢又變成廿六分平手，華聯再暫停，蔡罰中超越一分，觀衆齊聲爲汕隊助威之下，何立德不負衆望，乃領前三分，此時華聯慌亂，迨任相成穿入獲利，阿弟亦中，好容易三十比廿九追出。</p>
<p>最後二分鐘決勝負</p>
<p>學祟籃底搶求獲分，林擲中蔡罰中，卅四比卅三，汕隊尙落後一分，斯時阿孔緊釘蔡兩罰未中，何立德中籃卅四比卅五追出一分，淸江再罰入多二分，老包維聰老包成卅八平手。包罰入多一分卅九比卅八，任相成畢業卓代，淸江畢業紀入替，最後八秒鐘華聯第五次暫停，最後吳成早罰進一分遂成四十比卅八，底定大局，華聯得冠軍。</p>

<h3>常勝軍空前慘敗　漢城隊大勝東華　上下半時內各中二球</h3>
<p>漢城足球隊遠征軍，昨日於逸國球塲，與本屆常勝軍東華隊作來滬第四仗友誼賽，球迷震於兩隊威名，約計一一萬三四千人之多，陝西路邊，車水馬龍，市體育館之售票處，幾乎造成空前之盛况，逸園塲丙，座無隙地，幸憲警維護得力，秩序尙見良好。韓國領袖李承晚博士，昨日亦親臨球塲觀戰，故客軍士氣，更見阡盛，比賽結果，東華因老鐔久傷未愈，幼良脚傷離塲，終以零比四之比數，慘遭客軍毒手。昨日雙方出塲陣容如次：</p>
<p>漢城</p>
<p>車淳鍾　朴大鍾　朴奎楨　閔丙大　金奎煥　朱榮光　鄭國振　金容植　鄭南提　吳景煥　禹晶煥</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>張邦綸　莊友仁　張林根　梁樹棠　韓龍波　鐔福楨　於洽興　李垚　孫錦順　韓龍海　戴麟經　賈幼良上　陳明哲下</p>
<p>遠征軍　先開紀錄</p>
<p>四時卅分正，裁判何春暉，巡邊員鄧效良·陳吉祥，登塲執法，雙方合攝一影，東華與客軍兩隊長互贈隊旗後，比賽開始。漢城對陽光，順風來犯，金容植鄭南湜互有試射，阿莊林根先後救駕。東華進襲，未見收穫。混戰至八分鐘時，客軍傾師來攻，鄭國振冷路突出奇兵，於十四碼處人叢中，横掃入網，張邦綸視綫被遮，遂吿失手，一比零客軍首傳捷報。東華此球之失，張林根疏忽，該負相當責任。</p>
<p>十二碼　東華再欺</p>
<p>東華反攻，幼良邊陲疾進，至適當地點，一脚傳中，奈龍海頭頂不獲，阿戴亦有射門，借乎野逸。至十七分鐘時，客軍大舉來犯，吳景煥鄭南湜迭有攻門，阿莊生意興隆，混戰至廿五分鐘時，賈幼良腿部受傷離塲，經包紥後，再行入塲。卅六分鐘時，老鐔疲態畢露，客軍乘虛而入，鄭南湜冷路射門，來勢兇險，張邦綸猛撲擒住，四座掌聲雷動。至上半時終塲前一分鐘時，張林根禁區內救球心切，以手吻球，犯下十二碼大罪，客軍由右翼兩晶煥主罰，球出刁急異常，邦綸撲空，二比零，東華再失一城，上半時隨之完畢。</p>
<p>漢城隊　三元連中</p>
<p>易陣再戰，漢城原班未動，東華賈幼良下野，一外甥」陳明哲塡補空檔，中圈開球，戴元老與韓將軍雙管齊下，阿戴力射，車淳鍾撲出。五分鐘後鐔福楨亦吿離塲，梁樹棠人補，由韓龍波充任中堅，東華陣容益見軟弱。十分鐘時，鄭南湜單槍匹爲，直入東華腹地，張邦綸見後防乏人，及奔出鏠救，惜乎球出不遠，仍在鄉南湜脚下，舉足射門，邦綸已返身不及三比零再失一城</p>
<p>四比零　空前慘敗</p>
<p>東華雖大舉反攻，奈客軍防範森嚴，無隙可入，而客軍長力充沛，五鋒時有射門表演。至二十三分鐘時，龍海與明哲互易位置，仍未兌起色。三分鐘後，鄭南湜越過韓龍波，出脚力射，邦綸撲空，又遭失陷，竟成四比零之比數。在三十分鐘時，龍海獲角球機會，奈明哲頭上無靈，混戰至終塲前五分鐘時，漢城前衛朱容光因爭球，爲孫鐵腿撞傷，幸並無大碍，不久法定時間完畢，東華以零比四慘遭客軍毒手　本市協與運動器具用品公司，爲鼓勵客軍士氣，昨日特將該公司榮譽出品天字足球一隻，及錦旗一面，贈送漢城遠征軍。</p>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>華聯，汕隊，昨夕決奪本屆籃球聯賽甲一組冠軍，市體育館又見客滿。兩隊始終陷入苦戰，距終塲一分鐘時，仍以各三十八成平手，最後關頭，由包松圓，吳成章罰入兩分，取得錦標。</p>
<p>大李昨賽未臨塲，華聯全隊如失重心，開賽之初，會以二比八落後，上半時，孔廣益的遠射，有意外收穫，速山三球，蘇聯即以此寶貴之六分佔先。</p>
<p>在戰略上，雙方已用盡心計，汕隊仍抱定珍惜獲　經，絕不浪擲爲王，配合了準確的射籃技術。防守本籃，則設法管制　聯三個投籃人材，蔡演雄守吳成章，何立德守陳學崇，馬燦希守包松圓，而以上半時內，蔡之守吳，最獲成功。</p>
<p>華聯因大李缺席，無人負開路覓隙之責，老包任中鋒，又須兼顧防護本籃，位置不慣，老孔看林維總甚形吃力，但小林昨夕射籃，尙未達本人的峯巓狀况，相成祗負看守淸江之責，阻止其活動。</p>
<p>下半時，紀南康入替小林，汕隊連取五球，華聯僅罰入四分，華聯一度落後三分之多。此時，阿弟與學崇利用問不容髪的時隙，在極艱難的角度下投中，方得保持均勢。</p>
<p>汕隊演出，無疵可尋，一球之失，不足論成敗，事實上，就華聯的現况來說，除汕隊以外，絕不致遭受如此鉅大的威脅的。（昌年）</p>
<h3>鄕村建設與普及國敎</h3>
<p>— 胡叔異同</p>
<p>中國的建設，雖然千端萬緒，而基礎工作，還是應從鄉村建設做起。我人討論建設鄉村問題，重點仍不外乎敎育，換句話講，要用敎育的力量，啓發農民的知識，增加農民的生產，强健農民的體魄，並培養農民合羣團結的習慣。中國自古以來，拿「敎養並施」爲地方行政的方針，現在建設鄉村，必須用敎育的力量，也是一樣的道理，我們再舉幾點顯明的事實，來證明建國必先建設鄉村，建設鄉村必先普及國民敎</p>
<p>第一，幾千年來，中國就是一個農業國家，全國人民所需的衣食，輕工業的原料，以及埠際國際貿易所需的物齊，直接間接是從鄉村來的，所以全國人民的生命綫，在廣大四散的鄉村裏。</p>
<p>第二，全國的土地，百分之九十以上是屬於鄉村的，就人口數目，生活方式，以及生產的技術看起來，全國的縣市，至少有十分之九，仍是屬於農村社會的，而且一縣之中，至少有三四個鄉區，全國將近有一百萬個大小不同的農村社會，所以鄉村是組織國家的基礎。</p>
<p>第三，全國人口，約計有四萬萬五千萬，至少有五分之四，散居在鄉村，這些鄉村裏的居民，大部分是不識字的農民，要建設我們的國民，必須掃除佔全國人口五分之四的文肓。</p>
<p>從以上三點，我們已經可以得到建國必先建設鄉村，建設鄉村應先普及國民敎育的結論，並且國父中山先生在地方自治開始實行法中，特別指出設學校的重要，也就是昭示我們以敎育建設鄉村的可能與必要。我們很應該遵照這項指示，進一步去研究實施的方法的。</p>
<p>用普及國敎的方法來建設鄉村，除關於師資與經濟兩個事實問題，本文內暫不詳細討論外，在敎育理論方面，實在需要兩種革新的信仰——或者竟可說是兩種堅決的方針：第一，敎育應配合生產；第二，敎育應與生活合一。前者是敎民養民的原動力，敎養農民以生產爲中心，他們就感覺到敎育的需要。後者是管民衛民的出發點，用敎育的方式使農民自管自衛。這樣的鄉村國民敎育，以農民的實際生活，作爲敎育設施的對象，以農業生產，作爲敎育設施的目標。農民的生活方式改進了，農業的生產富足了，透過敎育過程而建設鄉村的目的，也就可以達到了。敎育的力量，不就是建設鄉村的原動力嗎？現在再爲分項說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）鄉村國敎與鄕村生產配合我國鄉村基本的職業仍是農業，所以鄉村的國敎設施，應以增進農業生產量爲最重要的目標。我國提倡鄉村國敎，有的主重識字敎育，有的主重公民敎育，可是無論識字敎育與公民敎育，總應該把農業生產作爲國敎設施的中心。例如畜牧，造林，水利，園藝，育種，以及農村小工藝等等，都是配合到識字敎育上去，或者充分應用之於公民敎育，這樣的鄉村國敎實施，就是農民每天生活必需的工作，他的功能好比適當的日光和雨水，各種農作物，經過了日光和雨水的培養，就會發榮滋長，試問農民誰不歡喜日光和雨水呢！同樣的理由，農業生產，要是透過了鄉村的國敎，都能够逐漸增進，試問農民，誰不需要國敎的普及呢！所以鄉村國敎不發達的原因，與其說是為了經費支絀，毋寧說是爲了敎育未與生產配合。</p>
<p>（二）鄉村國敎與鄉村生活合一　推行鄉村國民敎育，無疑的應該遵照規定，在鄉鎭保設立學校，但是要知道學校不過是有限的施敎地點，要貫澈國民敎育的眞精神，還要注意無限的國敎新領域，那就是整個的鄉村社會。前者的力量，在國敎過程中，當然是宣傳和示範的據點，後者是鄉村國家敎育重心所在，從事鄉村國敎，應固守據點，推進牠的重心工作。要是辦理鄉村國敎，不把整個鄉村社會，當做他的施敎領域，整個民衆，當做他的施敎對象，結果會產生兩種相反的現象；第一，學校容易做成消費機關；第二，敎育不會滿足農民的需要。這二種現象，减弱了國民敎育的功能，結果國民學校做鄉村建設的使命，始終不能實現！</p>
<p>總之，學校與社會合一，自然，敎育與生活融化了！敎育與生產配合，自然學校與建設打成一片了！這種理論，本來是國民敎育的眞意義，自然最適用於目前的我國鄉村建設。我們知道鄉村是中國最廣大的基層，雄設從基層入手，就是建設了國家的基礎。所以用普及國敎來建設鄉村，一方面是解決了全國廣大民衆的敎育問題，一方面是走上了建設新中國的大道。</p>

<h3>謀遏阻棉紗漲風　當局決採緊急措置　民營紗廠亟盼實施新管制計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中樞當局以近來滬市物價波動，尤以棉紗價格之騰漲，似已進入猖獗狀態，殊屬匪是。故即將採行緊急措置、制定若干禁例，交由滬市府及有關機關執行，以遏阻棉紗不合理之漲風，而安民生云。</p>
<p>民紡業務　無法維持</p>
<p>按日來滬市紗價連績暴漲，市價與議價相差之幅度，日見拔開。國營紗廠售紗結果，徒供中間商坐收漁利。民營紗廠繼續按照議價吿紗，已屬不可能，故售紗已陷停頓狀態中。紗商方面，則因僅恃紡建公司少額配紗，深感無法維持業務。紗業市塲，因市價與議價相差過多，致使合法交易，無法繼續，亦吿伴市。一如棉紗之生產及販賣，均已陷人麻痺狀態中。故關係當局認為緊急措置之斷然施行，實屬刻不容緩。</p>
<p>管制辦法全面顧到</p>
<p>治本方面。民營紗廠所建議之統籌產銷計劃，亦不在積極擬議中。蓋過去管制棉紗之方針，常失策於片面之管制。例如顧紗而不及花，花價暴漲結果，原議紗價，即吿脫節，不能作機動性之配合，致使再生產發生窒礙。計劃中之新管制辦法，自花至紗，以至資金之籌劃調劑，均將全面統籌辦理。自最初階段原料之獲取，以至最後階段成品之銷售，各階段均將加以貫穿聯緊，使能互相配合呼應。聞國民營紗廠，對該項新管制計劃，步調已趨一致。一俟具體計劃脫稿，即將送陳各關係當局採納施行。</p>
<p>充實紡管　委員人數</p>
<p>又管制棉紗機構之紡管會，亦在醞釀充實中。原有委員名額十一人，即將擴充，有增聘民營紗廠委員四人之說。某紡織業鉅子語記者：紡管會之充實，實亦爲民主成敗之一大考騐。民營紗廠所建議之新管制計劃，果能付諸實施，則行法須嚴格，施行後全體均應切實守法，則今後棉紗之產銷問題，不難獲一合理之解決。</p>
<p>紗號領紗　須有執照</p>
<p>中紡公司配紗限制甚嚴，除規定各項辦法外，各棉紗號棉織廠紗廠，必須領有社局工商登記執照，故週來各廠號未辦工商登記者，均紛紛向社局申請工商登記，以期獲得中紡配給紗。據悉：迄今前往申請者爲數甚多，社局工商科現正加緊審核工作力求簡化乎續，儘速發給執照，俾利工商業之發展云。</p>
<h3>絲綢合作工廠　接電後可開工</h3>
<p>社局輔導設立之針綫合作工廠及服裝合作工廠，前者目前發展尙稱順利，社局以其資金支絀，由該廠向中央金庫申請貸款六千萬元，允代保證，業經金庫批准。惟服裝合作工廠爲軍政部服裝廠失業工人所創設，僅長於製軍裝，當軍政部交付工作稍减時，即無，’法維持，該廠曇花現，於上月杪已吿淸理。至由社部社局中蠶公司三機構聯合輔導之絲綢合作工廠，現房屋修理已吿完竣，正待接電開工云。</p>
<h3>日絲四千箱抵滬　本週恢復配售</h3>
<p>中信局對日易貨所得人造絲一批四千箱，業於日前抵滬。該局代售會已準備於本星期起，對絲織業恢復配給。其配量將於今日上午開會決定。據該會負責人吿稱：四千箱人造絲至少可維持二月，計絲織聯營公司每月約需八百箱，其他各廠約一千箱云。</p>
<h3>商號調整資本　應行注意事項　財部令上海直接稅局遵照</h3>
<p>上海直接稅爲，頃奉財政部電令：査第一類甲項所得及特種過分利得稅之資本額，所得稅法第十三條第二項所稱登記年份，係指公司辦理設立登記核准之年份，如經辦理變更登記者，則指最後一次變更登記核准之年份，茲爲適應實際需要，便利計算起見，特再分別規定應行注意各點如下：</p>
<p>（一）公司經一次或數次增資者，其原登記之資本與歷次增投之資本，應分次調整。即就其設立登記或增資登記各該年份之物價指數，與收稅年前第二年度之物價指數，依規定公式，分別計算，調整數額，然後合併計算其資本總額。</p>
<p>（二）公司之增資，如係就其重估資產價値所爲之由股，並未實際另投資本者；或雖經投入一部份新股，而同時又將原有資本申股增資者，其全部資本額，均以最後一次增資登記年份之物價指數，與收稅年前第二年度之物價指數，依法調整之。</p>
<p>（三）合併後另立之公司及存續之公司，其資本額，均依合併後之設立登記或變更登記年份之物價指數，與收稅年前第二年度之物價指數，依法調整之。</p>
<p>（四）公司之减資與减資登記前，先經一次或數次增資登記者，其减資額之扣除，應以後增先扣爲原則。如减資前一次之增資額，不足以扣除全部减資額，則依次溯扣至全部减資額扣除爲止，然後就其餘額，及各該當年之物價指數，與收稅年前第二年度之物價指數，依法調整之。</p>
<p>（五）以上四項，於非公司組織，而應征特種過分利得稅之住商，均準用之。</p>
<p>（六）收復區之公司，除其在淪陷前，經依法登記之資本，應就其法幣原額，各照原登記年份之物價指數，與稅收年前第二年度之物價指數，依法調整外，其依收復區各種公司登記處理辦法規定辦理，變更登記所增加之資本額，或經辦理設立登記之資本額，均就此項變更登記。或設立登記年份之物價指數，與收稅年前第二年度之物價指數調整之。</p>
<p>（七）收復區非公司組綫，而應征特種過份利得稅之住商，除其在淪陷前經向當地主管商業機關登記合法之資本，應就其法幣原額，依照原登記年份之物價指數，與收稅年前第二年度之物價指數，依法調整外，其在淪陷期間，所投入之資本，均依收復後，經向當地主管商業機關依法登記年份之物價指數，與收稅年前第二年度之物價指數調整之。</p>
<h3>錢撞業籌組　全國聯合會</h3>
<p>全國銀行商業聯合會，日前已在首都正式成立。茲悉：錢莊業方面亦已開始發動壽組全國錢撞商業聯合會，本市　業公會並已推出泰潤卿等多人從事籌備，將會同各大都市錢莊業共同籌備，俾從速成立全國錢莊業之集體性組織，以發展爲業云。</p>
<h3>南貨業公會代表　向警社兩局請願　因海味等三行業拒絕售貨</h3>
<p>本市海味北貨桂圓業組織「三業公會聯合整規處」，抵制南貨業購買，經南貨業公會提供前三行業暴漲價格之發票證據後，已由市警察局將私抬價格之行號負責人，科以拘留七日之處分，並經市社會局命令撤銷非法組織之「三業公會聯合斃規處」，取締抵制，以安社會秩序。惟是項糾紛一度雖經調解將有成議，前日起前三行業忽一致拒絕售貨於南貨業，以致料紛愈演愈烈。故南貨業全體理監事及會員代表等，特向市警察局及社會局請願，略以南貨店物品亦是民衆必需之日常食品，若認其爲非主要品而任令優無標準之漲價，亦屬影響民生至鉅。而現在該三業竟敢變本加厲，將貨物關閉拒售，竟圖暴利，應請主管長官救濟等語。當時即奉警局行政處方處長，及經濟課陳科長接見，論知凡有私抬物價違法能斷，本局自當執法以繩，至已經科罰者亦必依法執行等語。嗣又奉社會局吳局長躬親接見，諭知前項非法組織，已經命令撤銷，並取締抵制售貨在案，自當再予追究，並將査有證據者五家行號，吊銷營業執照等語。請願團滿意而散云。</p>
<h3>一月份進出口統計　較去年底數目減少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據海關日前發表統計：本年一月份我國進口貨物凈値，爲一五〇，六二五，四三八，〇〇〇元。出口貸牧凈値，爲四八，四七五，三三九，〇〇〇元。一月份入超共一〇二，一五〇，〇九九，〇〇〇元。出口約爲入口之三倍。與去年十二月份相較，本年一月份之進出口凈値，均形遞减。進口减少五，九八一，四二五，〇〇〇元，出口减少二五，六七八，四二六，〇〇〇元。由上可見出口値遞减尤劇。</p>
<p>査各項進口貨値中，第一位爲油脂臘等，計二二，六三二，五二八，〇〇〇元。第二位爲紙及木造紙質等，計一三，五二五，一九七，〇〇〇元。第三位爲金屬及礦砂，計一三，四六四，四一八，〇〇〇元。第四位爲菸草，計一二，八四六，一五八，〇〇〇元。第五位爲毛及共製品，計一一，一七二，四六四，〇〇〇元。第六位化學產品及製藥，計八，八八二，七〇〇，〇〇〇元。而去年每月常佔進口値首位之原棉，已退居第七位，計七，八六七，九七九，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>各項出口貸値中，第一位爲油臘，計一一，八五四，六〇八，〇〇〇元。第二位為動物及動物產品，計一〇，〇九六，九〇九，〇〇〇元。第三位爲礦砂金屬等，計五，〇四四，五八八，〇〇〇元。第四位爲紡織織維，計二，五五五，六四二，〇〇〇元。第五位爲疋頭，計二，五四一，九〇一，〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>大票運用便利</h3>
<p>六區棉紡業公會茶負責人稱：近日盛傳發行大票，因之市塲又起波動。其賓在農產品登塲時期，必需大量現鈔，以炎還用。目前各地匯水甚大，交通困難，而小額鈔票携帶不便，如改用大票，可使運輸便利，週轉迅速，以增加　購數量，而减輕成本，對於農工商業均有利益。今市塲人心反生疑慮，刺激股票，物價上漲，其觀察不無錯誤，殊應改正心理，以期市塲得以安定，國計民生兩受其益云云。</p>
<h3>煤油業同業公會　昨開成立大會</h3>
<p>本市煤油業商業同業公會，前曾呈准社會局恢復發立，於本年一月間進行籌備。一面徵集各油公司及經理商號參加，一切早經就緒。該會特於昨日（二十日）下午二時，召開成立大會。到有光華裕新等油商會員代表三十餘人，並有社會局·市黨部·市商會等代表，列席指導。當由柯主席報吿該會籌備經過，繼由列席各代表致詞，旋通過會章，選舉一理監事等，於五時許散會。</p>
<h3>烵基基隆煤　來源均見增加</h3>
<p>越南鴻基煤礦最近來源漸見增多。台灣基隆煤礦產量漸見恢復，招商局已加派航輪裝運。開　煤來源亦可增加，故整個燃料問題，前途頗可樂觀。</p>
<h3>麵粉供應無問題　配售價暫不變更　政府存粉一百萬包隨時應急</h3>
<p>最近糧食價格普遍上漲，影響民生至鉅，獨有麵粉一項，因有福新等五大麵粉廠經常維持配給關係，對市上各類麵食無多影響。據五大粉廠配銷負責人吿稱：麵粉配價現仍維持每包四萬七千七百元議價，未有變動，最近期內亦決可保持此一售價，配粉亦不致中斷。蓋各粉廠自獲政府貸款六十億元後，每月已能收購小麥十三萬担，故對本市每日一萬餘包之供粉量，決無問題。且本年麥產，即司成熟，各廠即無洋麥接濟，原料方面將無匱乏之虞。</p>
<p>又悉政府在滬存儲洋粉一百萬包以上，以備萬一如各粉廠未能供應配粉需要，糧部將撥出一部分供應云。</p>
<h3>轉運商業公司　代表晉京請願</h3>
<p>上海市轉運商業同業公會，爲鐵路貨運營業所妨害轉運商業務，曾經召開會員大會，商討對策。茲悉：該公會依據大會決議案，昨日分呈本市市政府，市社會局，市參議會，市黨部，市商會，江蘇監察使署，淞滬警備司令部等各機關呼籲，並推定代表李慕蓮，劉春霖等，赴京請願。聞杭州市運輸商業同業公會代表龐菊甫，買樂山等，亦於日昨抵滬，聯袂晋京。</p>

<h3>本市賽璐珞工業　缺少原料發展困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調査：本市賽璐珞工業槪况，詳情有</p>
<p>（一）槪况；上海市養璐珞工業同業公會會員共六十三家，大中華賽璐珞工廠可以製造賽璐路原料，久已停工，故未加入公會。美華賽璐珞製造廠，美麗麥璐珞廠，及國光人造象牙廠，亦可製造原料，但不過以舊影片重溶而已。美華每月最高產量賽璐珞片二〇·〇〇〇磅，自來水筆管一五·〇〇〇打，現在實際產量祗及一半。美麗每月最高產量賽璐珞檯球料八·〇〇〇磅至一二·〇〇〇磅，國光兼製成品，故原料產量較少。其他賽璐珞工廠，不過應用本外國賽璐珞片加工製造而已。</p>
<p>戰前賽璐珞原料，多仰賴日本之供給。現在因日貨來源斷絕，故亦祇有以　影片充用耳。</p>
<p>（二）製品：　璐珞製品，如自來水筆桿，玩具，皂盒，鈕扣等，其產量殊難估計。</p>
<p>（三）原料：賽瑯珞原料，根本上不能自製。下述各原料，除硝化綿（或廢影片）及　外，本國均能製造：</p>
<p>原料名稱；A·硝化綿（或廢影片）每年最高需要量九十八萬磅（合四十噸），B·酒精三十萬磅，C·戊醇乙酟十二萬磅，D·碉二十五萬八千磅，E·鋅　粉一萬四千磅（九噸），F·　腦三十八萬四千磅，G·賽璐珞透明片八萬四千磅，H·標準乒乓原原料六萬磅，I·各色　璐珞片四十八萬磅。</p>
<p>現在每年需要量A·十五萬磅（合七〇噸），B·四萬五千磅，C·一萬八千磅，D·三萬八千七百磅，E·三千磅（一·五噸），F·五萬磅，G·一萬二千六百磅，H·九千磅，I２七萬磅。</p>
<p>（四）目前困難情形：一·本市各賽璐珞工廠，尙無製造硝化綿者。但如欲解決黄璐珞工業原料問題，必須有硝酸及硫酸之供給。二·該業會員，曾向敵為產業處理局標得製造賽璐珞原料之機器，每日可製二百磅，但迄今六七個月，因未接電，故未開工。三·該業希望外國養璐珞原料，可以有限制的繼續入口。</p>

<h3>台灣建設起步</h3>
<p>— 台北九日航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>日本人侵佔台灣半世紀，而開始建設的，還只是十五年來的事。這個進程，在戰爭的末期，就遭遇到頓挫，無法使其繼緻高度發展，現在這可給予了我們以一個重大的試鍊。</p>
<p>台灣在本年度是作爲「生產年」的，配合着生產，建設經費佔總預算四十億的20％，這個　大的支出，當局顯然有志於以事實來完成一個模範省的建設。建設是堪以增强省胞對祖國的認識的。</p>
<p>可是，在建設正在起步之際，却遭遇到二·二二八叛亂，這是建設工程上的新颱風，使滿腔熱誠投身於工作者的事業心，打了個大折扣，工作的源泉在目前已呈乾涸，這是退潮現象。澄淸當前局勢，正是開展建設工程的前提條件。</p>
<p>洋灰路面工程</p>
<p>總預算九百萬美金</p>
<p>海島本年建設的中心工作是與建竹東鐵路，其次就是環島幹綫構築洋灰路面，記者將特別介紹洋灰路面的建築工程。</p>
<p>領導記者在台北市郊新莊桃園間實地勘査的工程公司總經理吳文熹吿訴我：別小覷了這個公路「加工」工程，在環島省綫三百九十餘公里間，日人所築的洋灰和柏油路而，只有九十九公里，還有近三百公里，計劃每年以興建六〇公里的速度，在七年之內完成它，總預算九百萬美金。</p>
<p>去年十一月終吳總經理和公共工程局長費驊在新莊地點，開始了這個大工程的建設，原先計劃通過十五公里到桃園的一段，工程費是台幣三千三百萬元，可是物價迫使增加爲四千二百餘萬。當初決定在三月終完成，意外地遭遇到二·二八，時間又得拖延到五月終！</p>
<p>新莊至桃園段</p>
<p>需水泥三千五百噸</p>
<p>記者們趕到新莊這小鎭時，公路上正飄揚着灰沙，這裏與新竹昆鄰是「多風」之區，吳總經理爲堆在公路旁的細沙擔着憂，這是經不起風刮的。此行他更着重於察看前夜暴雨後彼衝擊的路而底再建，舖築竣工水泥面，最害怕的次日下着大雨，這期間是檔不住暴雨的摧殘，而過了一天，一直經四星期的陰乾，在水和沙的保護下，透露了光潔，平整，不龜裂的路面。</p>
<p>在這一段，過去日本人已鋪就有半幅者，這次僅鋪一三·九公里，平均厚一五公分，上下層均用混凝土，路而寬六公尺，分全幅二牛幅兩種舖築全綫共83400M2合12，510m3，截至四月五日止，已完成了48，400m2，尙有35000m2須待完成。這裏面，需要的材料是三千五百噸水泥，一三五噸鋼筋，這是由公共工程局供給的，其次是石子，和敷沙細沙都得從較遠的地區，運隊而來。</p>
<p>男女工人合作</p>
<p>新路面保用三十年</p>
<p>在十五公里之內，原先有七座混合機在工作着，現在因水泥供應困難以四座繼續開着工。最先我們在離新莊十六公里處的十八分，十七公里處，以及龜山等地仔細地看工人們工作。這裏十足表現了男女工人們的合作精神。</p>
<p>熟練的技工，在舊石子路上，整理路基，豎起了禁止軍輛通行的木牌，同時用鐵釘安置木模　。在道個木模的界綫之內，用二吋半到十吋半的卵石墊平，這是需要運用八噸，十噸，十二噸的壓路機的。之後，從混合機裏（本省有百餘呎的混合機，這專使用小型可以移動的機器）吐出來的混凝土利用人力敷設在這上面用手輾或木夯壓實在四角鋪下鋼筋，再加水泥像理髪一樣的加油以後，再用木板整理，這是由粗綫條到細綫條的工作。</p>
<p>在路面鋪築以後，需要鋪50am日寬15am日厚的泥結碎石路。　一條洋灰路面可以維持三十年的壽命，但它最怕的是積水，水是一切路面之　。</p>
<p>年靑的女工們</p>
<p>每日工資得一百元</p>
<p>最多的時候，有一千二百個工人，爲路面建築工作的現在只有四百多工人。他們之中，約二分之一是女工，這些女工，來自各處，大部份都很年靑，她們白粉珠唇戴了笠帽，手上戴了手套，在跣足之下腿，也用各種緋色的布包紥着，這幾乎是一個奇蹟，她們很有審美觀念，怕亞熱帶的紫外綫會損害她膚色的美！</p>
<p>她們挑着石子担，在輕便鐵路上熟練地推着水泥鐵車，用木板拉平着水泥路面，在工作中，已敎育了她們齊一步調，習慣地，按班做去。照實際，這段所需技工，四一七〇工，女工八七五七〇工，現在已付了四〇五〇〇工，尙需四六五〇〇工，假定用男工，則可减半。女工的效率恰等於男工的二分之一。</p>
<p>擠在工人的隊伍裏，她們留有濃烈的脂粉氣，她們每天可獲工資一百元，工頭可以得到十分之一的額外進益，但發放工資並不經過這中間人的。建設事業正也就是救濟失業！</p>
<p>利用台省出產的水泥，稱築洋灰路面，顯然地說明了台灣的公路建設是凌駕於任何一省的。雖然這樣的路面，還不是頂理想的，上面不能加柏油，更未能和以褐色。但與軍用公路形式的公路來比，無疑的已走上高級的工業化的建設。在海島西部有一條縱貫鐵路，平行的還有公路，在運輸和國防上，都有其特殊的意義。目前在石子公路上再加以洋灰建築，這在運輸和汽油，輪胎的消耗上，固有奠大的裨益，而對敎育交通上，更甚於經濟的價値。它是有助於文化，生活水準的提高台灣人民是幸福的！</p>
<p>完成建設工程</p>
<p>需要資本並需血汗</p>
<p>完成一件建設工程，需要付予一筆龐大的資本，更需要工作者的血汗。主持工程的前公共工程處主任壯懷辭職了，現在費局長派主任工程師李春松兼理，他一路最關心的是洋灰路而旁的積水，而吳經理則爲每一個步驟細心地校正監督，企劃的公共工程局和實際工作的工程公司是唇齒相依的。</p>
<p>費局長過去為川　公路工作着，吳經理最精心的傑作是構築樂西公路（樂山至西昌）總工程費在廿九年耗一萬萬一千萬，限期究成。這次以他倆爲環島公路的加工建設，人們正該充滿着樂觀的。但希望台灣能恢復前時的情景，維持工作者的事業心，更希望安定的政局能保證高級路面的順利完成！</p>
<p>這工作是艱鉅而偉大的，它提供了建設模範省的事實。</p>

<h3>國際間諜　艾士勒</h3>
<p>— 竹祺譯述</p>
<p>著名的共產國際間謀艾士勒是一個矮胖的穗奧混血種，看上去好像一位舊書商人或者是第二流的保險跑街。看他頭髪半禿，鼻架眼鏡，貓頭騰樣和萬的面貌，使人決不相信他是美國共產黨的首領。當他在衆院辦公廳裏受審時，他圓睜雙目對着審問他的反美活動委員咆哮呌屈道：「我不是間諜，不是外國探子，更不是共產黨首領……在沒有預先聲述以前，我不願宜誓。」</p>
<p>但是其他證人一致吿發他是共產國際的間諜，他的姊姊斐雪稱他是「十足的恐怖份子。」他們證明他和洩漏加拿大原子秘密給蘇聯的間諜有連帶關係，此外，還有人證明他文會獨自担任過間諜工作。反美委最會根據這一切證據正式以陰謀推翻美國政府，藐視國會，僞證，逃避所得稅和僞造護照等罪名提起訴訟。</p>
<p>作爲共產國際間諜的艾士勒，究竟是何等樣人？他對於美國人生活的影響如何，不僅美國人所欲知道，或許是別國人也樂於知道的吧。</p>
<p>崢嶸一時</p>
<p>艾士勒的父親是一位聰明動苦的學者，可是勞力所獲不足以養家活口。他的妻子是一個德國女子，是他在來比錫求學時遇到的。他在維也納大學担任敎授，爲了他憎恨宗敎而打碎了飯碗。他發憤著述哲學書籍，每天工作十五至十八小時，雖然博得了好聽的聲譽，但收入菲薄，生計維艱。他的妻子有時因夜飯錢無着，從他的書架上抽取幾本書偸偸地交給她女兒去賣掉。他們生活的困苦可想而知。</p>
<p>艾士勒是次子，他有一個哥哥和一個姊姊。他們三人對於父親的處世失敗深感非憤塡膺，迫使他們走向社會主義之路。長兄漢斯現已成名爲好萊塢作曲家，以音樂自娛。艾士勒和斐雪博覽羣書，好作辯論。斐雪追憶她的弟弟在靑年時代是「有書癖，愛好運動，興高采烈，喜怒無常，態度傲慢，個性倔强，易發脾氣」。又有一個維也納人說他具有尖刻諷刺的機智。當第一次世界大戰時，奧國公主曾發表談話稱二「維也納人吃番薯旣然剝皮，我不相信他們會遭遇飢饉的。」艾士勒的回答是：「陛下旣然不吃帶毛烤鵝，我們當然也不吃帶皮番薯。」</p>
<p>當第一次大戰時期，艾士勒曾服務於義大利戰綫，榮獲將章五枚，升遷至中尉職級。大戰結束時，他遄返維也納，加入奧　共產黨，担任組織，演說利編造小册子等職務。時在一九一八年，那時他祗有二十一歲。</p>
<p>可是共產主義在奧國並不發達。艾士勒姊弟二人都生長在來比錫，除了懷有野心以外，同時又很愛慕德國。那時奧國的工人紛紛加入德國出產黨。但智識份子領袖如鳳毛麟角，極爲需要。斐雪於一九一九年前往柏林，二年後艾士勒亦繼之赴穗。他們到了穗國以後，共產黨的政策變得迂迴曲折，同時發生劇烈的內鬨。</p>
<p>德國共產黨分製爲左右兩翼。斐雪始終被人認爲比她的弟弟聰明，而且那時富有性的吸引力，很快地高升到左翼領袖地位，而爲當時的頭角崢嶸的穗國共產黨領袖之一。</p>
<p>陷藏身份</p>
<p>艾士勒的智能比較他姊姊成熟得慢，他同時加入右翼陣綫，而變成右翼領袖白蘭德勒的親信。不久他分立一中和派而自任領袖，目的在調和左右兩派。但是黨的重心偏向右冀。斐雪和左翼份子堅決反對這一種趨勢。列寗曾竭力支持她。但至一九二六年史達林派驅逐了她，而由塔爾曼變爲共產黨的唯一領袖。</p>
<p>艾士勒勤舊地工作着，滔滔不絕地演說和寫作，依然野心勃勃地努力向上。一九二八年他認爲機會來了。塔爾曼的小舅子在漢堡因盜用黨內公款而案發，艾士勒率先攻訐，指控塔爾曼受賄匿贓，居然得到成功，結果塔氏被開去共然領袖地位。</p>
<p>一九二九年他前往中國担任新聞記者，旋即返國，保留他的固有地位，一直到一九三三年。此後一直到一九三九年，當他被禁於勒凡納時，他組織地下工作，反對法國瑞士及捷克的納粹份子。此後他又經由美國前往墨西哥，在此從事著作並爲雜誌投稿。他堅稱他旣不是共產國際的黨員，更無論是什麽間諜了。</p>
<p>凡是和艾士勒相識的人們一致證明他這句話是說謊。稍知共產黨內情的人對此並不覺得驚奇。一個共產黨員必須爲黨而犧牲他個人的一切，他必須盲目地聽從本黨領袖的命令，特別是要依靠他們生活的共產黨員，必須準備着執行偷竊，殺人，出賣朋友，甚至出賣祖國的命令。</p>
<p>艾士勒投進了這黑暗的世界以後，便變成了羽毛豐滿的共產國際間諜。他是加倍的熱心，加倍的謹愼，加倍的疑慮他的敵人和朋友，原因有二：第一因爲他曾經反對他的同黨塔爾曼，第二因爲他是已被蘇聯斥爲托洛次基派的斐雪的胞弟。艾士勒雖曾屢次揚言欲殺死她，可是她依然還是他的姊姊。在恐怖時代，當人家提到她的名字時，艾士勒的臉色就會變得蒼白起來。</p>
<p>爲了這幾種原因，艾士勒竭力隱藏他的身份，他的黨派關係。可是因爲他旣然做過長時期的職業革命家，他當然有許多老朋友，老同志，和疏遠了的親戚們，喜歡談論到他的事蹟，同時各國的警察對於艾士勒的活動也特別注意的。</p>
<p>艾士勒確曾於一九二九年到過中國，但並不是當新聞記者。那時蔣主席正在實行淸黨。身爲共產國際間諜的艾士勒負有淸除黨內間諜和携貳份子的責任。艾氏爲了向莫斯科表白他的熱心和忠實起見，殺害了軍民數十人，這消息傳到德國時，人們賜給他一個「劊子手」的譚號。</p>
<p>在美活動</p>
<p>艾士勒於一九三三年自巴黎起程赴美，隨身携帶奧國護照，他的委任狀和職級先期用密碼寄至紐約。艾氏憑其在中國獲得的成功，預料在美國可有更大的成就。</p>
<p>艾士勒對於羅斯福總統雖無若何關係，可是他在羅斯福許多幕僚中間確是得到很大成功的。一九三三年美國承認蘇聯一事改變了美國自由主義者對美國共產黨的態度，同時至少在外表上也改變了美國共產黨對自由主義者的態度。人民陣綫時代已經來臨，傑佛遜和林肯隨着馬克斯和列寗而爲美國共產黨的英雄：這一切都於艾士勒有利。</p>
<p>共產黨慣用的巧妙手段是聯合小資產階級以對抗一個公敵，等到那公敵打倒以後，然後再應付那臨時的同盟，艾士勒領導他的黨徒從事下列幾種工作：（一）潛入工會和其他合法的自由團體；（二）組織人民陣綫團體。他們已經得到相當成功，至少已經控制了美國工業組織大會的六個工會，並在其他許多工會中握有勢力。</p>
<p>艾士勒常化名遊歷各地，從事考察，演說和組織。在不能暴露共產黨身份的塲合，他以德國亡命者的名義博得人們的同情。他由以洞悉了美國的社會生活，黨派的優點和弱點，黑人和勞工問題，以及怎樣感化非共產黨的個人和團體。</p>
<p>最近有人問他担任共產黨領袖可曾冒過什麼危險，他聳肩答道：「我參加過巷戰，被人毆打過，領導過罷工，領導過示威的羣衆，但這算不得是什麽了不起的危險，這不過是千千萬萬的共產黨員的日常生活的一部分罷啦」</p>
<p>如果說職業的共產黨員對於個人的危險是毫不介意的，那麽他對於朋友家族和國家是同樣不介意的。他並不是一個愛國者，他對於德國具有深切的愛，可是他從來沒有盡過國民的本分。像每個共產黨員一樣，他第一個效忠的國家是蘇聯。</p>
<p>艾士勒最先於一九二〇年在維也納和女伶杜痕結婚，同居二年，至一九二六年宣吿離婚。現在她已經再嫁，住在紐約。一九三一年艾士勒在維也納娶小姨愛拉。最近「生活」雜誌記者在斯德哥爾摩發見她貧病交迫。據她說：她依然是艾士勒的妻子，從一九三八年以來，他遺棄了她和她的女兒。愛拉向該記者所提出的第一個請求便是艾士勒現在的地址。她說：「他是共產國際領袖人物之一，他利用他的機構得以避開我而讓我和我女兒挨着餓。他以共產主義爲護符，隨時可以找到一種託辭。他是個極聰明，詼諧，有趣的人兒，可是他是和社會與現實隔絕的」。</p>
<p>現在他和一個美麗的靑年女子布倫希達同居着，但沒有結婚。他們兩人於一九四一年離法赴美。馬賽的美國和墨西哥當局會會同簽發一張旅行許可證。所以他們對於這件事是知道的。</p>
<p>艾士勒是共產國際派駐美國的代表，這是毫無疑問的。但是他比以前更審愼地隱藏他的身份和使命。他寄寓在一家簡撲的公寓裏。他的公開的活動只限於「聯合反法西斯難民委員會」，幾乎一每晨九時必到會辦公。</p>
<p>他從來沒有到過共產黨總部，但是他隨時隨地對黨內領袖發號施令，有時用沒有簽字的字條，有時在公園裏，有時在餐館裏，大多數的黨負是不知道的。</p>
<p>當大戰期間美國共產黨會採取階級休戰政策。戰事給束以後，莫斯科方面下令恢復階級鬥爭，艾士勒奉命推行新政策，其主要目的有三：（一）唆使美國人不信任英美外交政策，並爲蘇聯的擴張政策辯護；（二）削弱美國對蘇作戰的可能性；（三）消滅美國資本主義制度。艾士勒常以漢斯保格筆名在「每日工人」報上撰文攻擊美國外交政策。</p>
<p>最近艾士勒轉移目標於美國的藝術家·作家和知識份子，使他們費助共產黨的政策。他的哥哥漢斯曾作過「共產國際」戰歌的曲譜和其他宣傳馬克斯主義的樂曲，現在是好萊塢的一位紅作曲家，帮助他弟弟拉攏一班文藝界人物。</p>
<p>艾士勒對於美國工人的階級意識將會發達到足以引起俄國式革命的希望，似乎已經放棄了。他的希望現在寄託在農民和中產階級身上。無論艾士勒的命運怎樣，美國人相信其他的艾士勒及其黨徒將繼續以罷工·示威·宣傳等手段，竭力推行他們旣定的政策。</p>
<h3>地層下的定源　廣西工鑛事業重萌新芽</h3>
<p>— 桂林十一日航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>地面上的貧瘠，往往掩沒不了地下轉富的寳藏，整個廣西的地面，可以說包括了任何一個時期的山脈，就在這萬壑深叢之中，不知埋藏多少珍貴的財富——不可勝數的礦藏，只要能够善於處理，從貧窮走向沾足，正是不外把手指灣一灣那末容易。家有千金而不自知者，乞人援手，情有可愿，家產千萬而不善川者，則未免近於悲觀了。然而廣西的上下人等，也知道怎樣駕卸老牛破車，走向一條較好的道路，這裏，讓記者吿訴你一點廣西地層下面的「礦狀」以及一點「人怎樣變成互人」的槪略：</p>
<p>錫鎢銻鉛　從事增產</p>
<p>廣西的礦產，以錫籤銻鉛最爲馳名，就中又以錫鎢兩礦獨得天厚。戰前戰後，在國際市塲上迄爲供不應求，就是在戰爭的時候，多少奸商還冒大不韙，偸運港粤銷售，敵人就拿這些原料，製成屠殺我同胞的武器。四種礦藏，大抵集中盛產於桂東富川賀縣以及桂北河池南丹一帶，官商經營開採者，亦以此爲第一目標。據確實調査：錫礦藏量達一九九二五一四公噸，鎢礦約有九九四九四四公噸，銻礦一〇八一二九二公噸，鉛約有五二〇〇〇〇〇公噸。去年失地初復，礦塲備受破壞，鍽沙出產尙可維持八一七六公噸的產量，其蘊藏之富，除了江西之外，恐怕甚少地方可與比擬。鎢錫的銷路，全部依靠外銷香港南洋一帶，在產地有官價規定，一放洋則身價十倍，商人搜購不遑，然而今年到現在止，商營礦廠產量竟只在五百至七百噸之間，去年得八千餘噸。成本及物價暴漲的影響，乃有日走下坡路之感慨。銻鉛兩物，多內銷於隣近省份，銻製品式樣美觀，（桂林盛製　鑊等物，極爲來往人士喜購，）銷路極暢。當局對於此等特種礦產的維持，極盡苦心孤詣，礦商救濟，有時偶亦發現，而開採最大的規模的組織，則是官辦的平桂礦務局，（省府與資源委　合辦，在西灣），內有最現代化的發電廠，大煤塲及鍊錫廠，今年至三月底止，已產錫八九一五公噸，粗錫二一五三公噸，而且產量日見增加。刻正廣闢礦堪，可增產五分之二。錫產前途，誠足樂觀。</p>
<p>廣西煤產　首屈一指</p>
<p>動力方面的泉源——煤的產量在廣西，可云首屈一指於華南，已調査所得之藏量，即達一一〇四三五九〇〇〇公噸之鉅，產地遍佈全省。土法洋法開採者，在在皆有，其中當推合山煤礦及平桂礦務局爲巨孽，然而所謂巨擘也者，產量却又少得司憐，平桂礦務局去年年產不過一四六八七公噸，合山煤礦（官商合辦，在來賓，）亦不過萬噸左右。民營煤礦產量合得五一四三公噸，然而這一點點煤礦，便牽製了整個湘桂黔鐵路的命脈，刻下通車的桂柳段及柳宜段，眞是「不可一日無此君，」遇到煤產不足時，火專居然燒榮算數，說起來好不好笑！好在最近又在桂中一帶發現廣大的煤田，據云其藏量不可數計。請求四聯總處貸款四億開採，請來請去，請到一萬萬，東西又貴了，後文如何，尙待以後分曉。</p>
<p>桂南全地　皆黃金區</p>
<p>千礦萬礦，最使人熱中內腸的，還有一個金礦。去年三百六十日，拾金的人們從深山中拿走了五千多雨的黄物，官家們在上林金礦起出了一萬六千五百餘兩毛金，今年呢，今年沒有確數。然而，入春以來，掘金者，却在一塲春夢中瘋狂地走向叢山峻嶺，全片桂南的土地，都是黄金區（桂東懷集伩都亦有出產。）戰前的大小礦廠，多至三百餘個，有的因此傾家蕩產，有的則平步靑雲。有人說：開礦是一塲賭博。往往是資本雄厚的操了左券，然而，抽水的「頭家」却也的確賺了無數的錢，又是事實。目前據估計：散佈的金礦廠，尙有四十餘家，其中又不乏秘密開採與「硬是開採」者，礦稅太使人頭痛了。</p>
<p>此外，如硫礦，一年亦有三萬四千餘公噸的出產，鐵則有二千四百萬餘公噸在地下候用，（說起鐵，不禁又使人想到百姓們玩鐵的「小事」。山州草縣，往往不知多少人拿起了土鑄的鐵，打成了並不很壞的機關槍，步槍，馬槍，手槍，流散在廣大的土匪和奸匪羣裏。單就武宣一縣，便有如此「兵工廠」四十家，其嚴重可以想見。）一切都是財富問題，只在人的手有多長，政府的眼光遠不遠兩個問題。</p>
<p>技術經濟　兩大援助</p>
<p>目今全省的礦廠，截至最近爲止，經省府盡力督導以後，復採者已有大礦一百除個，小礦區亦有二十餘個，（舊有大礦區五百餘，小礦區六百，）當局一方面請經濟，財政兩部予以技術及款項的援助，同時救濟分署正陸續撥發器材配給各礦區，刻下獲配者已達三十餘家，並聞行總亦曾令分署調査廣西現在礦區情形，準備調來大批技術人員及器材，協助建設，這無疑對廣西重萌新芽的工礦事業一個有力的援手，只要一廣西人硬幹的精紳一天沒有泯滅，十年五載，把一片荒凉土變成人間樂園，實在不是一件難事。</p>

<p>改善本市交通芻議</p>
<p>勝利以來，中區交通雖經當局屢施整頓，迄未解決。據公用局聲明，均歸因於公共車輛缺少，而三輪車，人力車大量增加，但據最近當局發表，市營公共汽車已增至一百六十七輛，巳與戰前英商不相上下，何以交通情况仍不如戰前，此中最大原因歐爲公共汽車路綫尙欠適當，按三輪車人力車之擁擠於中區，一因各區居民住來中區乘公共車不便，一爲蘇州河南北各區交通必須經中區，故目前路綫之增開，應以解決上述交通爲前題，而疏散人力車三輪車於各區，如以九路爲例，其終點在新世界，而乘客多以河南路以東工商機關集中區爲目的地，下車後若候乘他車或步行，旣轉輾費錢耗時，則寗可由出發地乘人力車直達目的地，若此雖關百綫亦徒使人力車長時滯留中區，你區內營業，旣不能解決擁擠，反有增加擁擠之弊。揣公用局九路，七路汽車不展人中區，意在避免本身受有限之時間阻滯損失，而竟不願其所負解決中區擁擠之任務，殊失改善市交通以利民行之旨。試規前租界時，南京東路有三綫公共汽車行駛，中正東路有五綫，北京東路有二綫均深入中區腹地，市民往來中區極便，少乘人力車，故中區無目前之擁擠，可資前鑑。</p>
<p>敝人居滬十五年，因職務關係，常往來各區，對交通情况較爲熟悉，今特抽暇　作下列建誠，深望　當局能予採納。</p>
<p>（一）現有路綫須改革者；</p>
<p>（甲）九路——自新世界循南京東路延至外灘，設終站於匯中成華懋飯店道旁，並取消西藏路，武勝路間繞綫。</p>
<p>（乙）七路——土目現終點過外白渡橋，循中山東一路西折南京東路，西路，南折黄陂北路，南路，西折復興中路，北繞林森中路寳慶路口終點，作爲舊法界與北區直達交通棧。　（丙）四路——自現終點循北京東路，西　，南折梵王渡路迄靜安寺，作東區與西區交通綫。</p>
<p>（二）擬屆路綫：</p>
<p>（甲）自宜昌路橋循江寗路，東折康定路，淮安路，南折中正北二路，東折新閘路，北京東路迄黄浦公園。</p>
<p>（乙）自閘北中山北路循實興路，南折寳山路，河南北路過橋，東折北京東路，南折中山東一路，二路，中山南路迄董家渡，貫通閘北，南市。</p>
<p>（丙）自閘北太陽廟路循大統路，東折新疆路，南折滿洲路，東折庫倫路，南折西藏北路，中路，南路，東折林森東路，民國路，又東折方浜東路迄十六舖。</p>
<p>（三）市營汽車司機每達終點，必下車休恩，以待時間校準後始開，然因沿途交通暢塞不一，致時有六七輛齊停終點，乘客久待不開，實屬莫大之浪費，而觀法商廿二路汽車，不作硬性時間規定，路中自行調整，車到終點即開出，司機在落班前，從不下車休息（按每站停靠時已屬休息，較諸長途汽車連開數小時者，實無終站休息之必要）車輛反無脫節，擁塞之弊，即在戰前英商亦無此例。</p>
<p>以上　綫，若能一一調整，則人力車，三輪車入中區之數量自可减少，而擁擠問題可獲全盤解決矣。（李作元）</p>

<h3>受審前夜的奇遇</h3>
<p>— 俄·柴霍甫著·林鳳藻譯</p>
<p>車夫轉了身，把馬鞭子指着從路上穿過的野兔子，說道：「我們嗣碰到運氣不好，先生」。就是沒有這惡兆，我也知道希望很少，因為我正要到附近的法庭去受重婚罪的審判。天氣十分壞。當我到達車站過夜的時候，身上堆滿了雪，好像已經受了一陣拷打；在破舊的馬車裏，經過怪無聊的顛簸之後，覺得又冷，又潮，又麻木。</p>
<p>到了站，看到站長。他是一個高個子，穿着藏靑色的條子褲子，好像是睡眠不足似的。他的頭已經禿了。他的鬍鬚好像是從鼻孔裏長出來的，因此，他的嗅覺也許不甚　般——我敢說。那裏臭味眞多。站長口裏磯咕着，鼻子裏哼着，搔了搔腦袋，開了門，一旬話也不說。只用臂肘指着我晚上憩宿的地方。我嗅到封臘的氣味，又嗅到一些非常辛辣的東西，差不多氣也透不過來。桌上放着一蓋錫質的洋燈，不住的冒烟，剛能照見沒有油漆的板壁。</p>
<p>我走進屋子，把旅行袋放在桌上，對站長說道：「先生，這裏有討厭的臭味」。站長抽了一口長氣，搖着頭說道，「氣味總是那氣味」。他又搔了一搔頭說道：「你覺得有氣味，這是因為你剛從外面霜雪裏走進來的綠故。」</p>
<p>我把那個人打發去了，開始檢查我暫時的住處。我晚上睡覺用的沙發很寬，像一個雙人床，上面蓋着冰冰冷的汕布。沙發之外，有一個大鐵爐，一張桌子（就是我上面請過的桌子），一雙別人的氈靴，一個書包，還看一架屏風把這房問的一角園了起來。屏鳳後面有人正無得安穩。我四面看了一看，就整理床舖，開始脫衣服。不久，我的鼻子對那種臭味也聞習了。我脫了上衣，褲子，靴子，然後走在鐵爐旁邊跳躍取暖，兩個光腿一上一下的翹　。立刻就覺得暖了一些。最後需要做的，就是把沙發攤開睡覺——可是就在那時候，一件奇怪事情發生了。</p>
<p>我的視綫突然停在那屏風圍着的壁角。我辛到屏風後而有一個女人的頭，散亂的頭髮，鳥黑的眼睛，泛泛的微笑，你看我是多麽　異。她烏黑的眼毛正在閃動，臉上有酒渦，好像正在笑。我於是不自然了。她覺得我看見了她，也不自然了，就躲了起來。我躺在沙發上，用外套蓋着。</p>
<p>我覺得對於這件事應當負責任的。多麽糟，我自己想，她一定看到我跳躍的樣子——這並不好看。一想起她甜蜜的臉形，我就不由自主的作起夢來了。一幅一幅的圖書擠進我的想像，一幅比一幅美，一幅比一幅俏。右頰上突然發燒作痛，好像是想了壞事的處罰。我摸摸我的右臉，雖沒有賞到什麽，但我知道毛病出在那裏了。</p>
<p>這時，我聽到這女人的聲音：「怎麽辦呢，這些討厭的臭蟲，眞像要把我呑下去似的。」</p>
<p>我於是想起了我有一個好習慣，就是在旅行時總是帶着紀丁氏的殺蟲粉。這一次我也沒有忘記把它裝進行李。我就立刻從旅行袋裏把裝粉的錫盒子取了出來。只要把這藥粉送給那美貌的女子，彼此就可以認識了。但如何送給她？</p>
<p>「多麼糟糕！」我聽她又是喊着。</p>
<p>於是我就低低的說道：「太太，聽了你的呌，我知道你正被臭虫吵着，我倒有些紀丁氏的殺虫粉。你如果要，我就——」</p>
<p>「是的，我要。」</p>
<p>「馬上就米。我穿了外套就送過來。」我高興的說。</p>
<p>「不，不，你從屏風上面遞給找，用不着跑過來。」</p>
<p>「我就從屏風上面遞給你。你不必害怕，我不是喝醉了酒的過路人。」</p>
<p>「誰知道呢？你是個陌生人。」</p>
<p>「好罷。就是我走進屏風，也沒有什麽。再則，我是個醫生。」我立刻就撤了一個謊，「醫生，警局偵探，與婦女的理髮匠，到私人地方，可以不用迥避的。」</p>
<p>「你眞的是個醫生嗎？眞的嗎！」</p>
<p>「請你相信我。那麽，你許不許我把這粉送過來？」</p>
<p>「好，如果你是醫生，隨你的便。不過你幹麽要勞駕呢？我可以要我的丈夫到你那裏來。」她停了一會兒，高高的耳語着：「耕地亞，醒醒罷，你這海豹。起來，到屏風外面去。這位醫生眞好，要把臭虫粉送給我們。」</p>
<p>聽說屏風後面有一個呌做腓地亞的人，不免嚇了一跳。我心裏充滿了失望；鎗上的開關機，在子彈走火時，也許會　到同樣的失望；我眞是又慚愧，又懊惱，又悔恨。我呆了；當這腓地亞從屏風背後走出來的時候，在我看來，眞像一個流氓，我差不多要喊救命了。　地亞是高個子，一身全是筋骨，約模五十歲光景，臉上長着灰白色的鬍子，兩片嘴唇貼得緊緊的，鼻子與太陽穴上全是細細的靑筋。他穿着睡衣與拖鞋。</p>
<p>他接了殺虫粉，回到屏風裏面說道，「多謝，多謝。你太容氣了，大夫。你是不是也有臭虫打撹？」</p>
<p>「是的。」我說。又在沙發上趙了下來，狠狠的把外套蓋在身上。「是的，眞的是。」</p>
<p>我聽到他和他太太說話：「茜羅茜茄，你鼻子上有一個吳虫在跑；讓我把它從去。」</p>
<p>「你提罷，」茜蘿茜茄笑着說。然後她呌着，「你並沒有把它捉住！虧你是一個參議員！人家都怕你，可是你還攬不過一個臭虫！」</p>
<p>「別吵，茜蘿茜茄，不要忘了這裏還有一個陌生人。你總是講不該講的話。」</p>
<p>「這些小畜生，總不讓你睡覺。」我很生氣的咕嚕看，不知道為了什麼。</p>
<p>這對夫婦漸漸睡着了。我閉着眼，打定主意不想什麽，好好睡覺。半個鐘點過去了，一個鐘點過去了，可是睡不着。</p>
<p>最後，我的鄰居開始翻動，彼此在耳語裏埋怨着。</p>
<p>腓地亞抱怨着說，「眞怪，就是這殺虫粉也沒有什麽用處，臭虫太多了。」</p>
<p>然後，他呌着我說：「大夫，茜蘿茜茄要我問你，為什麽這臭虫氣味這樣雜聞？」</p>
<p>我們開始講話了。我們講到臭虫，天氣，俄羅斯的冬天，藥品——其實我對於藥品的知識，與對於天文學的知識，同樣不成；我們又談起了愛迪生。</p>
<p>然後，我聽到他輕輕的靑備他太太，「茜蘿茜茄，你不用怕醜。他是醫生。不要害羞；你問他罷。沒有什麽可怕的，謝維拓甫天夫沒有辦法，也許這大夫有辦法。</p>
<p>「你去問他罷。」茜蘿茜茄輕輕的說。</p>
<p>腓地亞就同我說了：「為什麽我太太的胸部老是發痛？你知道，她總是咳啾，並且覺得胸口很重，好像有東西塞在那裏似的。」</p>
<p>「那需要狠長的解釋，不是幾句話可以護得完的，」我說。我想法避開這問題。</p>
<p>「解釋長，有什麽關係呢？我們有的是時問，反正我們又睡不着。好大夫，請你把她檢查一下。我必須吿訴你，謝維拓甫大夫給她診過，他是個好人，但我不很相信他的話。不，我不相信；可是，我覺得你不會像他那樣的給我們一個太樂觀的診斷。我請你把她檢查一下，同時我到站長那兒去，呌他把茶爐子安排起來。」</p>
<p>腓地亞套上拖鞋，走了出去。我就走進屏風。茜蘿茜茄坐在一個闊沙發上，圍着許多枕頭，她拉着她的花邊領子。</p>
<p>我坐在旁邊，縐着眉頭說道，「請把舌頭給我看。」她把舌頭給我看，開始笑了。她的舌頭很正常—紅的。我按了她的脈搏，含糊說道：「唔」，雖則我並沒按到脈搏。我記不得對她的笑臉還問了些什麽。只記得檢查完了的時候，我自己覺得是一個僂瓜，再也不想問別的問題了。</p>
<p>腓地亞回來了。我們三個人喝茶。我就開了一個藥方，就我所知醫生們開方的法子，開了一個。（甩拉下交寫的。）</p>
<p>這樣去了　〇五公分</p>

<p>第二天早上，臨走的時候，我提着旅行袋站着，跟我的新勝友們吿別。我想以後不會再有見面的機會了。腓地亞拖住了我，硬要我接受一張十個慮布的票子。</p>
<p>他說，「務請接受，我對誠實的工作，總是付錢的。你研究過，你工作過。我都知道。你的知識是流着汗得來的。」</p>
<p>我沒有辦法，只得將那錢接受下來。我受審的前一晚就是這麽過去的。</p>
<p>法院的門開了，法警告訴我被吿的席位；那時候的情緒，我不預備叙述了。我面上發靑，頭裏發昏，四面一望，我看見千把隻眼睛正對着我，我似乎聽到我自成怕喪鐘。我對着陪審團嚴肅而重要的面孔望了一望。</p>
<p>我看到一個鋪着紅布的桌子，又在檢查官的席上看到一個人，你知道是誰—正是腓地亞！我的恐怖我不能描寫　你也不能想像。他正在寫。當我望着他的時候，我就想起臭虫，茜羅茜茄‘我的藥方—在我的脊樣上，不但　覺到一陣嚴霜，並且感覺到整個的北冰洋。</p>
<p>腓地亞寫完了之後，抬起頭來，望了一望。起頭，他並不認識我，他的眼睛張得大大的，他的下吧垂下來了，他的頭搖着。他慢慢的站了起來，對我冰冰冷的看了一眼。不知為着什麼，我也站了起來，也對他瞪着。</p>
<p>「被吿，講你把你的姓各職業等等吿訴庭上，」法警開始說着。</p>
<p>檢察官喝了一點兒水，坐了下來。他的額角上堆着許多汗。</p>
<p>「眞是一網子魚，糟透了，」我想。我知道那檢察官要向我報復了。他一再翻閱書面的證據，嘴裏咕嚕着。</p>
<p>但是寫到這裏可以停筆了。這是在法庭裏午飯休息的時候寫的。休息後，檢查官馬上要講話了。</p>
<p>呵，天呀，他要講些什麽呢？</p>

<h3>說詩</h3>
<p>— 波蘿</p>
<p>在一春之循環」裏，太戈爾說：「我們把人類從他們慾望的束縛上解放出來，」黑格爾說：「詩的目的在把和識的宇宙的究竟理想的形狀，放進想像的形式裏。」從這幾點看起來，我們可以知道詩是一種和講的眞理理。</p>
<h3>柯萊莉的幽默</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>英國女詩人柯萊莉（MarceCorelli　1884-1824），父母都是義大利人，但自小就由英詩人馬刻（C．Mac-key）撫養。成人後她決定終身不嫁人，她的朋友都非常奇怪，於是問她，她回答說：「我沒有嫁人的需要咧！我要個丈夫來做什麽？我家裏有三樣東西，它們都是具有一個丈夫的目的的。一樣是狗，它天天早上咆哮不休；于樣是鸚鵡，它每天下午都嘮叨地。咒駡着；還一樣是貓，它每天都是半夜裏才回家來。」</p>
<h3>山東道上</h3>
<p>— 習善</p>
<p>讀過兒女英雄傳的，應該記得安公子在客店所遇見唱曲的姑娘，那是從前南北大這上最動人的風光，却也是無數悲凉血淚之所累積。自從有了輸船鐵路，過往的人少了，綺羅脂粉，更平添無限弔古的情懷。此地是齊國的西境，恐怕是　駒　歌之　風罷！</p>
<p>但是這種文獻從來少見，惟有這光末年，南匯張文虎的日記裏曾有一段寫實的記載，據說這種妓女年歲稍大使變成縫窮的，共經濟生活之慘可以想見。張氏日能名「夢因錄」，是一部有價値的書，光緒初年，淸河王氏刻「小方　齋輿地叢鈔」，搜羅旅行的日記極多，而無此書。簡鋒如左：</p>
<p>「自陰平而北，一客入店，挾瑟者盈門。其齒自十一二至十七八而止。扉靡之音，不俟客命，　頭賞數十實蚨，笑盈頰矣。稍長則以縫窮市，鵠面鳩形，飾以濃記厚粉，車夫奴子視為溫柔鄉。其為士者笑之，惡知即向之挾瑟來者也。戲塡黃鶯兒四　云：</p>
<p>「南北路迢迢，况嚴冬冰雪交，愁中忽見桃花笑，眉兒黛描，臉兒粉調，半彎紅袖琵琶抱　雙挑，婷婷嫋嫋，一個個翠苗條。</p>
<p>含笑入廉來，坐斜簽一字排，四條絃上聲聲　，訴風情幾回，勸村酤幾杯，行雲流水卿休怪，猛徘徊，蒼生此輩，淪落儘堪哀。</p>
<p>幼小識春識，問何曾習女工，貪財薄俗錢刀重，巫山者舉，巫山那峯，旗亭驛館年華送，太匆匆，紅顏如夢，轉瞬又縫窮。</p>
<p>旅館正無聊，喜征車暫息勞，酒星入座花化星照，高歌恁高，豪情恁豪，花香入酒寒威埽，醉酕醄，繩床一覺，明日馬蹄遙」」。</p>
<p>文虎是身歷道咸同光四朝的一個通儒，他先與阮元胡培　陳奐等為師友，實能承受乾嘉樸學的家法。可是中年以後，在上海與李善蘭容閎交往，因此得交英美旅舉的學者如艾約瑟之流，他本來是深通天文算學的，於西洋科學巳經從書本上得過了解，又加以近世的見聞，遂使其成為博貫中西，且以中國通儒而　心西學的第一人。曾湘鄉在同治以後的提倡西學，除李容二君外，恐怕還是受張氏的影響最多，因為惟有他這樣的文章經術，才能動曾氏之聽。錄其送容純甫赴彌利堅持一段如左：</p>
<p>「地厚三萬里，經一三其周；此至　瓦　，路實半地珠，四於四天下，獨自成一洲，彌國雖後起，雄與英佛侔，代立效契丹，擇賢與衆謀；賢哉華盛頓，立法今率由」。又有送李壬叔入同文館詩云：</p>
<p>西法流傳逐漸新，借根對數己稱神；一從羅密書翻後，又使前賢歎積薪。（注，代微積拾級米利堅羅密士所著）</p>
<p>律度量衡事本連，誰從墨翟溯遺編？成書細譯胡威立，機器無如重學先。（注，英吉利胡威立著重學十七卷）」</p>
<p>張氏與嶺南的陳，同為光緒初年僅存之樸學前輩，而能致力於天算律呂者，而張氏佐金山錢熙祚刋守山閣　書，及續輯藝海珠塵，小萬卷樓　　等，於搜羅文獻，貢獻尤大，這也是因為他生於江南，而又無官情世事以相擾之故。</p>
<p>他的詩詞，却又極有風趣，已如上所述，我尤喜其楹聯之雋爽，如彌勒殿云：「咦，個中人這般快活；唉，門外漢適從何來」？如唐六如　云：「身後是非，盲女村翁多亂說；眼前熟鬧，解元才子幾文錢」。如書廚云：「開卷有益，用志不分」。亦足為佳話。</p>
<h3>風景</h3>
<p>— 柯裴</p>
<p>柯裴（Coerbet　1819-1877），是反抗傳統的理想主義而倡導寫實生義的領袖。</p>
<p>他高揚着「寫實」的旗幟，表現他眼睛所能見得到的美的事物和眞態。用他美妙純熟的技法使所見到的物象表現於晝面。十九世紀的歐洲畫壇就被他畫上了粗而深的一綫。</p>
<p>所作人物，風景，靜物都具有眞實感。如照相般的沒有絲毫主觀的嚴肅的描寫物象之「形」。連非美的份子都在他描寫之中。這就是所謂純粹的寫實主義。（獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血264</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>到了國際大旅社，鶴見剛想休息一下，却有旅社的侍應，報吿有人請見。來人事亭一表，比鶴見高了小半個頭。僅僅一見面，這位瀟酒而又沉着的風調，早把鶴見的倦意打消，不期然地覺得精神一振。</p>
<p>「對不起，早到了半個小時」；來人操着純熟的日語，聲音柔和，圓潤，而又包函着十成火候的剛勁。</p>
<p>「歡迎之至……」——見熱烈地握住來人的手不放，「鄙人鶴見玉，賜下必是曾守一先生」？說到下半句，鶴見改了北平口音</p>
<p>守一的人品，和百忍莊的大槪情形，己有正岩的報吿，鶴見覺得自已的工作秘書，沒有對守一隱瞞的必要，所以在十來分鐘之內，已經傾瞭倒　，向守一徹底說明。守一也表示了一見如故的誠意。這兩位靑年，都以天眞坦向相見。</p>
<p>在談話中，鶴見像靑年的小姐太太，炫耀自己的體己珍寳似的，把　　，虎城和另外的幾位同志，一一介紹給守一聽。</p>
<p>「敝莊存一位姓余的同志，大槪和貴部的一位岳君相識，聽說還是老同學」。守一提到了記者岳君和貴部那邊的大槪情形，是由正岩君見告的—也是由於小弟替他揭露了那個宮崎貞夫的秘密……」</p>
<p>「可見我們應該都是同志了。」鶴見始終想請求百忍莊參加自己一方面的組織。</p>
<p>「當然都是同志，這是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>「那麽，如若我們有所請求，貴同志們想必不致推却的哩！」</p>
<p>「只要不與敝社宗旨衝突的話—我想也不致有什麽衝突—我們一定能始終合作十分工合作。」守一把合作的疆界劃出了一條極淸析的分水綫。「我還有一個小小貢獻：在一個共同大目標之下，我們可以聯絡各種同志小集國合作，然而不一定要有某種表而上的統率……</p>
<p>「凡能聯絡到的，必是氣味相投的，也必有一或兩個媒介，一旦有事，必須應用某種集團的力量，就可由這個媒介通知。這救是我所說的「分工合作」。這其中有不少的便利：一方面可以聯絡各同志集團，精神相繫，聲息相通；一方而多少可由各個集團保持自有的自由行動，而無須由某一個集團擔負一切責任，等等。」</p>
<p>守一這佩「小貢獻」一面是說明了百忍莊的意志，一面也是由於看出籠見有失望的神色，所以必須給他這個捝明，而且也是給他一點安慰。</p>
<p>「…很對；　，很對…以前我竟沒有想到這一點…」鶴見似乎憬然大悟似的。</p>
<p>「　不是你沒有想到，却是你無法想到！」守一笑着。</p>
<p>「怎麽說？」鶴見天眞的瞧着守一，，好像他回守一，自幼就在一起長大一般親妮。</p>
<p>長之兄歸納席勒的最後一本劇作的倫理思想說：</p>
<p>「爭自由，爭光明的具體化就是革命，革命雖也免不了流血，這分別是在一個是自衛，是迫不得已，是爭正當的權利，是為公；一個則非自衛，並非迫不得己，純粹是慾望，是自私。」</p>
<p>從這正確有力的看法，我們可以籍以認識到大詩人席勒底高峻莊嚴的精神，更轉研作為席勒最後的劇作維耳海耳姆，泰耳（Wilbelm　Tall）。我不禁發生一迎串的感想。</p>
<p>太史公說得好：「死有重如泰山，或輕如鴻毛；用之所趨異也。」同是一死，却不能等量齊觀，因為泰山之重不能相等於鴻毛。</p>
<p>成仁取義的死與多行不義的「自斃」，也就相差得太遠了。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>我想——</p>
<p>人類若干的「光榮」，都是「恥辱」所幻化，而被人為作「恥辱」的，也可能掩敝着人類至尊的「光榮」。</p>
<p>因此，我反對流俗者對一切不甚瞭解者的任意毀謗與侮辱。</p>
<p>因此，我乘風　勝於珠玉。</p>
<p>而對於許多所謂「可尊的」，或「可鄙的」的世相，在我未走入深切之瞭悟時，我絕不願隨俗阿附。</p>
<p>靜靜的體會，遠勝於淺膚的繞命。</p>
<p>佛弟子修持時，有一種必經的階段，曰：「坐關」。意思就是把自己的臭皮　關入一個狹的　裏，讓驅榖去接受許多的災難；這種苦行的結果，可以促進本身靈魂土的解脫。</p>
<p>沒有到相當的修養功夫，不能「坐關」，如逆理勉强為之。那末由於心體問的矛盾乃至於破裂，修持者如非為疾病所擊倒，必至癲癇瘋狂。甚至喪生。這種突然發生的變態心理，用　羅乙特的話說，即是　意識的水閘大開，洪水滅頂是也。</p>
<p>思想的運用如行路，欲速則不達。許多救世利人的道理，都在有步驟的苦思下悟得。</p>
<p>傳說達摩祖師會經面壁十年。無自私，無人我；不急躁，不慌張；消除無限的妄念，破盡一切的執著；把自我送入「色空一相」的境蜀裏。「慈悲」是佛永遠的精神，大慈大悲：中慈中悲；小慈小悲；不慈不悲；悲天憫人是一切宗敎家最始也是最終的精神。</p>

<h3>如何回拜</h3>
<p>— 李海</p>
<p>外國規知是：客人進門須脫大衣和禮帽，也許中國人在剛剛學習這套禮法的時候，覺得未免太為麻煩。但是日子一長，也就由「麻煩」而「進步」為習慣，由習慣而「提高」到非此不足以表示禮貌和敎養了。</p>
<p>普通客人進門尙且要脫大衣，以示禮貌，準此，武士造訪別人的「府上」時，當然是更應該要解除用冒了。吾則，誰知道你是親善來的呢，還是報仇來的呢？</p>
<p>隨後，也不知怎麽搞的—主啊，但願是由於人類自衛力不斷地提高的緣故吧—，道種私人問交接的禮貌，竟致在國際公約上被摒而不用了。强有力的國家根本就滿不在乎於別人的武裝訪問；弱國即使提心弔阻着別人的攻入，但也不得不裝做無所謂的樣子，咬住牙齒忍住痛的接待「訪間」。這件事從表面上看起來是「平等」的，因為他可以來，你可以去，一來一往，正合交友之道。然而……</p>
<p>且說英國巡洋艦「堡麥達」號及驅逐艦「雷戈士」號、得到我國政府同意，將於明天駛滬訪問。</p>
<p>是的，我們並不担心這兩隻戰艦將永遠在中國的頜海裏作長斯的訪問，「像是回到了它們的家鄉一樣，永不歸去」。他們既然是有名的紳士國，我們就不應該懷疑他會做小人事—譬如說砲手突然一發神經，向上海開砲　；或者是官員們帶點私貨上岸來販賣懸；又或者是永手們全都像那個「討厭的」小艾德禮一樣，在中國離播民主種十，致令一般人民人心不古的喊遇：「外國的民主比中國好！」等等。</p>
<p>說到底，我着急的倒是如何回拜的問題。</p>
<p>穿着　胃的武士，帶着上弦的弓，和出　的刀，來「訪問」一個病弱無力的家族，總是免不了震驚的。然而你有力拒絕他嗎？弱者的門永遠為讀者而開—不開也得開。開着走進來，關着打進來。就這樣，自然的法則往往是如此。（四月十七日）</p>
<h3>「原子竺大王」的笑話</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>記得在抗戰以前，會經有一位作家說過中國同胞不懂得幽默，這自然是「慨乎言之」的過激之詞，因此惹起了若干頑固的同胞們的一塲非議，認為他看意張他人的威風，等於說西洋的月亮比中國的月亮好一樣的無柳。</p>
<p>其實，要說過激，却大可不必。中國同胞之中，不懂得幽默的，固然不乏其人；甚至於不慣得眞話的，也何　　不出實際的人證。把眞話當作笑話看，這才是　　可怕的病象。</p>
<p>最近，「原子筆大王」　諾氏，搭了「彈　號」飛機，飛來了，又飛回了。有人問雷諾及其正副兩機師在短期內將幹些什麽。三個人的回答都很簡單明瞭有趣。其中之第一人，說：「　！」第二人說：「吃和　」！第三人說：「吃，　，討老婆」！</p>
<p>因為這三個回答簡單，明瞭，而且天眞得有趣，於是，又有人雷眞把它看作笑話，而以「一笑了之」了。懷着這種看法的人，大抵都是只知吃，　，討老婆而不知其他的。他們那裏知道雷諾他們之發言，正是再切實也沒有的眞話，因為他們經過了三百三夜不睡覺不休息的壯舉，如願地完成環球飛行之新速度紀錄之後，難道不需要吃，　，以補償其過去的疲勞嗎？至於打破飛行紀錄在前，討老婆在後也够現實的，不正是符合於「洞房花燭夜金榜掛名時」的中國精神嗎？我以為只有把中外古今的現實作統一的看法才能夠不致把眞話看作眞話，或者把眞話看作笑話。</p>
<h3>胖子會</h3>
<p>— 芸</p>
<p>報上說：江西的胖子們，最近發起成立了一個「胖予會」，把胖子分成特胖，大胖，中胖，小胖，和準胖五等。遍寄「脾子連鎖」，廣收胖子會友，大家鬧得十分熱鬧。同時據說列名發起的胖子，頗多是當今的名流。</p>
<p>所謂胖子，一定是腦滿腸肥，大腹便便的人物，這是由於身體內的脂肪過多，又能心曠神怡，才致成胖。當然，一個每天要愁柴愁米，或會至連紅秈米和靑菜亦吃不起的人，永遠也不會胖起來的。</p>
<p>所以，「胖子會」可以說是一個財富的集團，它對於瘦者是一種獰笑，也是一種諷刺；而一人胖，萬人瘦，那更是令人痛心的事實。</p>
<h3>奴化敎育的流毒</h3>
<p>— 子華</p>
<p>台胞借誤思想的種種</p>
<p>台灣不幸曾被日本帝國主義強佔了五十一年，在這五十一年中，日本人除了窮兇極惡的榨取台胞的血　外，並實施一種呌做什麽「皇民化」敎育，千方百計想使台胞忘却祖國，輕視祖國，而成為他們「天皇」的順民和奴隸。因此在台灣重歸祖國版圖的今日，的確有多數台胞不但對祖國的語言，文字，思想已經遺忘，並且對祖國有許多曲解的地方、筆者旅台年餘，對台胞所受日本人歪曲思想　輸情形知之頗詳，爰略述一二　國人明暸日本在台灣實施奴化敎育流毒之深。</p>
<p>去歲當我抵台不久的幾天內，便有一位台胞問我：「先生，祖國最高高的房屋也有新台公司那麽大嗎」？（筆者按：新台公司是在台北係以五層石洋房　築的百貨公司）我聽了後不禁啞然失笑。不料再過未久另有一位台胞來問我：「祖國也右像這裏台北一樣的電燈嗎」？這時我眞不知應該怎樣告訴他才好，祇得很攏統的回答他，「這裏有的，祖國樣樣有，祖國有的這裏却未必有」！</p>
<p>日本人不但把我們的風家向台胞宣傳得鄙陋不堪，而見對我們內地的同胞尤極盡其侮辱的口吻予台胞以極惡劣的印象，他們說中國的人民都是只吃飯不做事的，中國的學生要到高中畢業，才了解地球是圓的，中國的兵連槍都放不響，只要人多一嚇就逃跑了，中國人的奮慣是嫩　，自私沒有禮貌……。</p>
<p>台灣同胞因為受日本人奴化敎育的流毒如此之深，所以這次發生的一三八事件當然也非偶然。我們除了對他同情和諒解外，應該急速的帮助他們施以再敎育，才是正當的辦法。</p>
<h3>王鐵珊軼事</h3>
<p>— 雲間</p>
<p>王瑚鐵珊，前淸翰林，誠篤君子也。梟雄如袁世凱，亦不敢不尊敬之。民初上海江海關，將查獲充公之大量鴉片烟土，於浦東特建大窑一座，　以焚燬。王鐵老鷹任總統府特派員，蒞滬監視。時滬海道尹為王賡廷，詢鐵老作何準備？日余旣　斯任，當一明眞相，以備返京報命。講道尹派一嚮導，　一小艇，給一普通入塲之劵，餘不勞招待也。道尹知此老有書獃氣，唯唯應命。翌晨，鐵老携一僕，登小艇，渡浦入場。　稠人中，翹首四顧。上有官長席，關監督，道尹，交涉使，縣知事，以及各國領事，　商領袖，列坐其間。前　烟土數百箱，嚴封密裝。場中辦事人員，奔走甚忙，無何啓箱點視，澆以煤油，擲置窑中焚燬。參觀者咸交頭接耳，指為　鼎。雖黑烟蓬勃，同無鴉片氣息，鐵老亦心疑之。翌日復赴窰場，親手扒取烟灰一大包，挾持回京，面呈總統，指此為焚土有弊之實據也。袁曰，先生辛苦矣，余特請先生赴滬監視，不過藉示我總統府未嘗同流合汚耳。若執此為舞幣證據，係誰交付？有誰作證？蒼且將誣先生不遂所欲，特以此假灰為陷害之計，先生將何以自白于天下？雖然，余深　先生為　篤君予，先生亦可以自白矣。　衆雄與盡生之鬼地，　不可同日而語矣。</p>

<p>昆明基督敎女靑年會有文藝欣賞會之組織，每星期三開會一次，聘請雲大或國立師範學院諸文學敎授演講，演講後會員提出自己創作大家討論訂正。學術空氣，極為濃厚。</p>

<h3>談黃泛區</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>行總　長霍寶樹此次視察黃泛關　來，宣稱該　（豫皖蘇接境一帶）已成沙漠一片，土壤正在漸漸變質，倘然不及早開墾種植，將來恐將不可救藥。所謂不可救藥者，就是說它有一日會變成真正的沙漠，那就一時不會再有開墾而供人居住的可能了。</p>
<p>研究中國的中外學者，都會說過中華民族與千年來受著慘酷的自然淘汰，我們的租先本來都住在黃河之北，一那氣候乾燥，確乎適宜於人類的生存。不幸　北的黃沙，卻與我們爭奪土地，它步逍地在向南面進逼着，同時滔滔黃河，更時時泛濫成災，淹沒我們的屋舍田地，使我們不能不逃往南來。這幾千年來南邊的人們，雖然也能開闢出一個世界，創造出江南的文明，可是由於這邊氣候的潮熱，　　的構行，因而我們的身體就受到重大的摧殘，對於由　民族的優先實在是一個嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>可憐的是這個淘汰還在進行之中，水旱災荒不但使我們貧上加病，還使我養成自私的劣根性：因為慷慨的人在飢餓的磨難之下往往是要淘汰的。有人稱黃河是中國的悲哀，應說從這里去看它的正確性。中華民族在北者所面臨的敵人當然不止一個自然界，我們從周朝起就有種種北方的民族在不斷向我們侵略、然而外禍總不如自然界那麽殘忍，更沒有自然界那麽頑强。試看當年侵略我們的數不淸的各個部洛，現在都到那裏去了？惟有這個沙漢和黃河却永遠不肯放過我們，直到今日還在殘殺着我們這民族的生機。</p>
<p>抵抗這兩個大敵的武器不是沒有，這就是新思想　入中國以來大家一直喊得很響而至今人人對它還有空洞之感的科學。別的國家也有與董河一樣類似的敵人，可是他們都用科學加以征服了，非但征服了，並且加以利用了。我們呢？且聽霍　樹的話：「再遲將不可救藥！</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「協　！很忙吧」？他自己拉過一把椅十來，坐在　老頭兒的對面，笑嬉嬉的說。</p>
<p>「不忙！不忙！老兄有什麽事見敎儘管談好了」！老諸對於老祝，自然也不免有些敬鬼神而遠之的感覺，所以早就打定了用客氣而又圓滑的方法來對付他。</p>
<p>老祝不就　　，先回頭去　了　靠在他椅子後面的金愛　。</p>
<p>「祝先生，你也想走嗎」？金愛　也知道今天　　　老頭兒的人決無第二件事，而且她也並沒有忘　昨天　和老祝所談的一番話。</p>
<p>「我自己還不想走」。老祝搖着頭說，同時又向金愛麗特別盯了一眼。「金小　，我想請你　協座談談，可不可以帮帮胡太太的忙」？他又怕諸老頭兒一時摸不淸楚，又特別加上一句。「帮帮胡覺文太太的忙」。</p>
<p>「好啊！我們今天下午就要走了……」！金愛麗很與　地說，可是她立刻懊悔息已說得太快了，她可以很淸楚地看見坐在　　上　　一　假笑的　協理正向自己一再使眼色；於是她想到今天上午　防司令部介紹一位陸太太。想搭　老頭兒的小　　　，有過司令　，　有黎太太的信，可是老諸也很巧妙地拒絕了，還有XX銀行的一位副理，來談了好半天，結果老諸答應帶他一個人到柳州去，條件是XX銀行照三分利息，先放一千萬紛老諸。</p>
<p>「祝先生，實在抱　」　諸老頭兒也說話了。「愛麗她不知道我的苦。天地良心，我諸希農是最愛帮朋友忙的！何況老兄？只是我那一輛　特車年份已經很老，最多只能坐四五個人；現在我公司裏就有七個人必須走，再帶我們兩個。祝先生，</p>
<p>他以下的話老祝　實沒有聽，前現的幾句已經够了。祝兆年眞有些懊悔今天不該來碰這一個釘子。</p>
<p>現在要　金愛　來給老祝頂上去，她實在沒有這個胆氣；並且她也不知道應該怎樣說，諸老頭兒　的話是眞是假，她根　　摸不淸楚。可是她也看到了老祝的為雖　神氣。</p>

<h3>Setbacks for the Communist Forces in Southern Shanxi; Northwest Pacification Headquarters to be Established in Yan'an</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 20th] National Army reinforcements to southern Shanxi are arriving in succession, with a large force concentrated in Yuncheng, Anyi, and Linjin, effectively controlling the river crossings, reversing the declining situation in southern Shanxi. A large-scale counteroffensive is imminent. The Yongji to Anyi line is reported to be secure. Communist forces have begun to flee north, concentrating west of the Fen River. The situation in Xiangling and Linfen is increasingly tense. In the Yi clan area, both sides are encircling each other, and the intensity of the fighting is unprecedented in southern Shanxi. In addition, two regiments of Communist troops fiercely attacked Fencheng on the morning of the 19th. The situation in the city that afternoon is unclear. In the Fenxi and Huoxian areas of central Shanxi, more than 8,000 Communist troops have gathered, attempting to cut off the Taiyuan-Linfen railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 20th] National Army forces in southern Shanxi recaptured Yi clan county on the evening of the 16th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taiyuan, 19th] According to related sources, Communist forces are attempting to open a route to Outer Mongolia. 100,000 troops are concentrated in the northern Shanxi areas of Pianguan, Hequ, Wutai, Kelan, Shuoxian, and Ningwu, threatening to invade in two routes. The commander of the eastern route is Yao Zhe, with Zhencheng and Jining as target. The commander of the northern route is Zhang Zongxun, with Qingshuihe and Helin as targets. Recent military news from Yuncheng has been very confusing. In fact, except for a brief disruption of the airport by Communist forces, the area has been calm throughout.

Chairman Chiang invited Xu to a casual meal at 8:30 PM, accompanied by Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng. According to Xu, the Chairman hoped that he would take a position as a government commissioner, but he believed that although the title of government commissioner was very high, there was no actual work to do. The Chairman mainly hoped that he would come out to help. Xu said, "Of course, otherwise I would not participate in the National Assembly. I would not advocate participating in the government, but to help, there must be something to do, so I cannot answer tonight and will consider it further." Xu also said that before he came to Nanjing, Zhang Junmai had instructed him to discuss the modification of Article 1 and Article 15 of the National Government Organization Law with the Chairman. Tonight, the Chairman agreed that Article 15 could be deleted, while Article 1 was based on Article 77 of the Provisional Constitution and did not need to be changed. Regarding the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the Executive Yuan, Xu said that he and most of the members of the Standing Committee of the party shared the same opinion, that is, they advocated participating in ministries, not just as ministers without portfolio. It is also learned that Wu Xianzih is scheduled to fly from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Zhang Junmai recently sent a letter to the Chairman, explaining the opinions of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on the allocation of seats for National Assembly representatives, legislators, and supervisors, hoping to occupy a certain proportion in the above-mentioned various elections.

<h3>The Internal Strife of the Democratic Socialist Party Has Come to an End</h3>
<p>Li Daming Clarifies His Position</p>
<p>[News from This Newspaper] Secretary-General Lei Zhen arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. When interviewed by reporters, he said that he came to Shanghai to attend the board meeting of the Xinhua Art Society, not to mediate the internal strife of the Democratic Socialist Party as rumored. However, he had met with people from both sides for convenience. According to his personal opinion, the internal strife of the Democratic Socialist Party is not as serious as rumored. It is only that one side believes that since the Standing Committee has decided to fully participate in the government, the ministries of the Executive Yuan should also be included. Lei said: The Democratic Socialist Party's non-participation in the ministries is temporary, and it is expected to join soon. The current situation is unlikely to affect the Democratic Socialist Party's established plan to participate in the government. This matter is an internal issue of the Democratic Socialist Party, and it is not easy for outsiders to speak, and from the standpoint of a third party, I am unwilling to offend either side. At the same time, the internal strife has been around for a long time, and it is not something that I can mediate in a short period of time. It is heard that Wu Xianzih will come to Shanghai today. In this way, all the key members of the Democratic Socialist Party will meet together, and all problems can be easily solved by themselves. Regarding the amendment of the National Government Organization Law, Lei said that the two parties did not demand that the Chairman be responsible to the two parties as rumored, so the problem is not difficult to solve, and Nanjing is expected to make a decision on this today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Tang Xiangming and others of the Democratic Socialist Party recently used the names of Zhang Dongsun, Wu Xianzih, and Li Daming to publish a letter to Chairman Chiang, a letter to Zhang Junmai, and a public statement, accusing Zhang Junmai of launching a "purge movement," and their words and deeds were extreme, which aroused the disgust of enlightened people inside and outside the party. Zhang Dongsun has denied participating in the matter, and Li Daming also telegraphed from Honolulu yesterday to clarify his position. The original telegram is as follows: "Mr. Zhang Junmai, I have received your telegram. My proposal for full participation has been stated in the previous telegram. At that time, everyone acknowledged the list of government commissioners passed by the Standing Committee, and there was no denial of it, and there was no signing. My name was included in the statement by Baoguan and others. I did not know about it beforehand, and there was no consent. Daming." Hao (19th). According to the public statement issued by Tang Xiangming and others, Wu Xianzih's name was signed. It is said that Li Daming signed it on his behalf. Now that Li has telegraphed to deny it, then Wu's name is also a forgery, which is obvious.</p>

<h3>Lin Biao Died After Being Assassinated; "Mayor" of Harbin Li Tianyou Was Executed</h3>

<h3>American Expert on Chinese Affairs Discusses the Reorganization of Our Government; Says the Spirit of Democracy Is Universally Celebrated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Washington generally expresses satisfaction with the Chinese National Government's reorganization of drawing in people from other parties and non-party members, and Chairman Chiang's leniency towards the Chinese Communist Party. The White House has not yet made any comments on the establishment of a Chinese coalition government. Acting Secretary of State Acheson publicly expressed his support for the new members joining the Chinese government, saying that the United States knows these people very well and that they are highly admired by Americans. The White House is waiting for the Secretary of State to return from Moscow before the U.S. government can formally reflect on the new Chinese government. One of the very few experts on Chinese affairs in the U.S. Congress, Congressman Judd, told a reporter from the Central News Agency today that Chairman Chiang's continued efforts to democratize China with an indomitable spirit should be universally celebrated. Judd continued, The government reorganization held in Nanjing this week has made Americans believe that Chairman Chiang has always worked hard to the best of his ability to make China move towards improving the government and expanding the government as soon as possible. fact Judd believes that given the enormous challenge of changing thousands of years of authoritarian rule into a republic, Chairman Chiang's forward movement is actually faster than any rational person would have expected. Judd firmly believes that China has encountered many obstacles, because China has been invaded by Japan in the past, the Communist fifth column in China has been secretly sabotaging, and there is Soviet communism, as well as misunderstandings and interventions from Western countries. Judd criticized some people who slander Chairman Chiang's one-party rule in a satirical tone, saying that these people are quite tainted with red. Judd accused that these critics are accustomed to using "slanderous tricks" to accuse Chairman Chiang of one-party rule, but they are incapable of seizing control of the government for themselves. Judd continued in an interrogative tone, Is it that any other country has sent leaders of the Communist Party and other minority parties to attend the San Francisco United Nations Conference? It is heard that the United States has not sent Communist representatives to attend UN meetings. I have read through history and it is difficult to find a greater example of Chairman Chiang's vision, breadth of mind, and adherence to justice in reorganizing and expanding the central government. Judd intends to appeal to Congress to pay attention to the end of the one-party government in China, and requires the leaders of Congress to make efforts for China and not for the Soviet Union. American Special Committee for Investigating National Defense Plans Chairman Proster told reporters from the Central News Agency that he was "very satisfied with the progress made in this direction and hopes that this means that the United States will adopt a more stable policy to support the Chinese government." He said that Washington will adopt a more assertive policy to support the Chinese government. A reporter from the Central News Agency also requested Powell, a leading figure in Congress who claims to sympathize with the left, to comment on the reorganization of the Chinese government. He declined to comment, saying only that he did not fully understand the new government and therefore could not comment at this time, but he promised to issue a formal statement to the Central News Agency within the next week, but he said that he was willing to do his best to maintain the friendship between the United States and China. An observer told a reporter from the Central News Agency that when the new reorganization of the Chinese government is fully understood, American sympathy for China will undoubtedly turn into something more practical. Unfortunately, only a few people are currently observing the importance of this reorganization, and only a few people are paying attention to recent developments. It is rumored that the future development of U.S. loans to China must be decided after Marshall returns to the United States. In fact, U.S. policy toward China is often determined by Marshall, because he has close ties to China. Over the past week, American politicians have been busy solving many of their own urgent problems. Such as labor, legislation, the telephone strike, the recent loan plan, the Texas explosion, the debate on the World Relief Fund, and the Moscow Conference.</p>
<h3>Gong Xuesui Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

According to reports, Dalian is currently experiencing a shortage of food and medicine.</p>
<h3>British Economist Weekly Praises Our Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The influential British weekly "The Economist" published a long article today, analyzing the political conflict in China, concluding with high praise for the National Government, which, while dealing with internal strife, still adopted a tough diplomatic policy. The National Government raises the banner of nationalism, and at the same time, when the National Government insists on China's dignity in international forums, it has almost united the people of the whole country under its leadership. The government, in particular, has won the support of all politically sensible Chinese people when it resolutely protested the Four Foreign Ministers meeting discussing China's internal affairs, with the exception of the most fanatical Communist elements. The weekly also pointed out that the Chinese government has also adopted a tough approach to the discriminatory measures against overseas Chinese by the Philippine government and the Indonesian government. This strength in protecting overseas Chinese can fully prove that internal strife has not made China powerless internationally.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] U.S. Congressman Mansfield recently told reporters that the current reorganization of the Chinese government is indeed a step in the right direction. He said that the expanded foundation of the Chinese government indicates that Chairman Chiang wants to make the government a more representative government of the Chinese people. He said that Zhang Qun's appointment as the President of the Executive Yuan was an excellent choice, and he could not think of a more outstanding leader than Zhang Qun, the former chairman of Sichuan Province, whom he had met when he came to China at the behest of Roosevelt in the early years of the war. He feels the same way about Sun Ke.</p>

Allied nationals shall not bear the cost of repaying the property. The Far Eastern Commission's order also defines "outbreak of war," stipulating that the time of outbreak of war for each Allied nation is December 7, 1941, but for China, it is July 1937, and for France, it is September 12, 1940.</p>
<p>According to Brigadier General Tan's statement, the current restitution of assets only applies to individuals currently in Japan, charitable and religious organizations operated by foreign companies with resident general managers in Japan, and enterprises owned by United Nations nationals residing in Japan.

<h3>Taiwan to Establish Cooperative Farms; Land Policy Now the Focus of Provincial Administration; Will Eliminate the Middle Class That Exploits Farmers</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Taipei, 20th] The land policy of the province has now become the focus of the Public Office's administration. Chief Executive Chen intends to solve the land problem as a test of realizing the Three Principles of the People. He told reporters from this newspaper that the outside world has little understanding of the land in this province. Public land accounts for 70%, and private land accounts for 30%. Of the 70%, including mountains, barren hills, rivers, airports, etc., only 23% is actually occupied. Of this percentage, only one-fifth is arable land, which is not a large amount. At present, the Public Office has decided to use this land to operate cooperative farms, divided into primary and advanced types, with a total of more than 180, under the responsibility of the Cooperative Business Committee. The rent collected is lower than that stipulated by the Land Law, and the maximum amount does not exceed one-quarter of the harvest. Zhou Yie, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, said: "The main purpose of building farms now is to reduce labor, increase harvests, and lower rents. The middle class that exploited farmers in the past will be completely eliminated. It is estimated that the annual income will exceed 700 million yuan."</p>
<h3>Our Consul General in San Francisco, Zhang Zichang, Talks About the Situation of Overseas Chinese; Government Should Pay Attention to Enhancing the Political Status of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 20th] Zhang Zichang, Consul General in San Francisco, was summoned back to the country to report on his work. He arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 19th and met with a reporter from the Central News Agency to talk about the situation of overseas Chinese in San Francisco. Zhang said: "At present, there are about 20,000 overseas Chinese living in San Francisco, most of whom are engaged in business. The most are those who run restaurants and grocery stores. During the war, the San Francisco market was prosperous due to the concentration of soldiers and tourists, and overseas Chinese businesses also benefited. After the end of the war, various industries were slightly affected. Among the 20,000 overseas Chinese currently living in San Francisco, including those born in the United States, 7,000 have acquired US citizenship. However, all overseas Chinese love and care for their motherland. During the war, many overseas Chinese served in the US military or participated in wartime production work, making great contributions to the front and rear. All of this is enough to promote understanding and communication between the Chinese and American nations." Zhang continued: "Chinatown in San Francisco has gradually expanded recently. The schools run by overseas Chinese include Jianguo Middle School, Shanhua School, and several primary schools run by various guild halls and churches. In addition to receiving education in American public elementary schools, school-age overseas Chinese children can also learn Chinese characters in the above-mentioned schools. There are several newspapers, including China Youth Morning Post, National Daily, Jinshan Times, Sino-Western Daily, and World Daily. In terms of population, the newspaper industry is more developed than in China." Zhang finally said: "At present, the problems that the government should pay attention to are how to export Chinese goods to the United States to increase the value of exports and facilitate the needs of overseas Chinese, and how to enhance the political status of overseas Chinese in the United States. The latter depends on the unity of overseas Chinese and the ability to use the right to vote well. In the recent election, only about 3,000 overseas Chinese and American citizens of Chinese descent voted in San Francisco."</p>

<h3>The Late Chairman Lin's Estate to Be Auctioned; Lin Sen Vocational School Established in His Hometown; All Estate to Be Valued and Exhibited in the Capital</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing, 20th] Ms. Lin Chen Shaohua, the widow of the late Chairman Lin, is currently in Nanjing presiding over the liquidation of his estate and, in accordance with his will, auctioning off all of his estate to establish the Lin Sen Vocational School in Shanggan Township, Fuzhou, his hometown. A reporter visited Ms. Chen today at the former residence of the late Chairman Lin at No. 5 Ruyi Lane, Beiting Lane, Nanjing. Ms. Chen was simply dressed and often told that the house was also on the auction list. When the reporter asked about her future whereabouts, Ms. Chen said: "I have not yet considered this point, because I remember that the late Chairman Lin often said: 'Leaving money to ten grandchildren is useless if they cannot use it; leaving books to children and grandchildren is also useless if they cannot read.' We are ordinary people, only seeking to be fed and clothed, and have no extravagant hopes, so selling the house is to comply with the will. As for our future whereabouts, it has not been decided yet, but most of us will return to Beiping, because the late Chairman Lin hoped that his children and grandchildren would stay in Beiping, the city of culture, so we have lived in Beiping for a long time." In addition, the late Chairman Lin has four grandchildren, one of whom is a granddaughter. The eldest grandson, Lin Tao, is in Fujian. The second grandsons, Lin Ping and Lin Liang, are continuing their studies at the Jinan University Affiliated High School in Beijing. The granddaughter, Lin Na, is studying at the Huiven Girls' High School in Beijing. After the preliminary work of the property team of the late Chairman Lin is completed, the valuation work will be carried out, and then it will be exhibited and sold in his former residence. The types and quantities of his estate are recorded as follows: (1) Residences: land near Zhongshan Mausoleum, a summer villa in Guling, a house built jointly with others in Guling, a western-style house at No. 5 Ruyi Lane, Beiting Lane, a museum in Yugele and Yonglou at a hot spring; (2) more than 4,500 pieces of calligraphy; (3) 201 pieces of antiques and miscellaneous items; (4) 40 large boxes of books and souvenirs.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Final Stage of the Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>The Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference has already been going on for over a month since it opened on March 10th. During these forty days, all that has been seen at the Aviation Club is one wave after another, with arguments and debates raging; not only has there been no progress on the agenda that the four powers had set before the conference, but now it seems that the Foreign Ministers Conference may end in discord. According to a Moscow dispatch from the French press on the 19th, observers generally expect the Moscow Conference to close in the next day or two (the 22nd or 23rd), with a resumption of the Foreign Ministers Conference in July. In the past few days, there have been rumors that US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin would be leaving the Soviet Union to return to their countries within the next week; today, there are reports that the British and French delegations have made preliminary preparations to leave. Even Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, after forty days of verbal warfare, feels exhausted. If the above news is true, then not only will the basic points of the German peace treaty not be agreed upon, but also the Austrian peace treaty, due to the unresolved issues of German assets in Austria and the demands of southern countries on Austria, will not be signed in Moscow. The failure of the four powers to reach an agreement on the German issue will have a serious impact on the future international situation, but all parties had already anticipated this before the conference. However, the failure to sign the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow is a great psychological blow to the world.</p>
<p>Since returning to the United States from China to take office as Secretary of State, Marshal Marshall has been deeply studying the post-war international situation, especially the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union; deeply aware of the crux of the problem, he resolutely went to Moscow to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, hoping to use his military strategy and political wisdom to shed a ray of sunshine on post-war peace. Therefore, before heading to Moscow, Marshal Marshall had three main goals in mind: (1) to agree on the main points of the German peace treaty and decide on the date for convening the German peace conference; (2) to sign the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow; (3) to conclude a Four-Power Pact to guarantee that Germany would be disarmed and would not rise again to commit aggression. However, Marshal Marshall, observing the general trend of the world, also knew that his mission would not be easy to accomplish. Therefore, on his way to the Soviet Union, Marshal Marshall made a speech stating: "The work of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is extremely difficult, and the German peace treaty may not be drafted during the conference. The purpose of this conference is only to reach an agreement on the basic points of the German peace treaty. If this goal can be achieved, I will be very pleased." From this statement, it is clear that the "fruitless" outcome of the Foreign Ministers Conference was already within Marshal Marshall's expectations.</p>
<p>Let's look again at how Marshal Marshall has maintained a calm and adaptable attitude throughout these four thousand days of the conference, always wanting to prevent this Foreign Ministers Conference from being "in vain." Initially, Marshal Marshall remained silent, listening quietly to the lofty discussions of the British, French, and Soviet Foreign Ministers. Only when it came to critical junctures or unresolved disputes did Marshal Marshall change his attitude of silence and present his arguments. The intention of this approach was simply to ensure the smooth progress of the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, Marshal Marshall's approach failed to change the atmosphere of the conference. Foreign Minister Molotov consistently adhered to his preconceived notions and was unwilling to budge. When the United States proposed the conclusion of a Four-Power Pact, the Soviet Union even proposed amendments that made it fundamentally impossible to establish. Marshal Marshall had no choice but to seek another path, attempting to break the stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, and requested a direct meeting with Stalin. However, the result of the Stalin-Marshall meeting did not produce any new effects, and the stalemate of the Foreign Ministers Conference remained unbroken. Therefore, Marshal Marshall has indeed made his greatest efforts in the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference; the failure to break the stalemate of the conference can be seen as a failure of Marshal Marshall's diplomacy.</p>
<p>We summarize the opinions expressed by the four powers in the past forty days and find that the divergence of opinions among the four powers has indeed reached its peak: (1) Regarding the issue of disarming Germany and clearing Germany's war potential, the Soviet Union attacked the British and American occupying authorities for failing to comply with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and effectively disarming Germany and destroying Germany's war potential; the British Foreign Secretary retorted, and Marshal Marshall also defended the Allied Control Council. (2) Regarding the issue of purging the remnants of Nazism in Germany to achieve political democratization, the United States advocated that the same methods should be adopted in the four occupation zones; France expressed its agreement, but believed that German politics must first be democratized before the remnants of Nazism can be purged; the British and Soviet Foreign Ministers, however, accused and attacked each other. (3) Regarding the issue of German reparations, the Soviet Union demanded $10 billion in reparations from Germany, and that the reparations be extracted from Germany's current production; Britain and the United States firmly opposed this; France expressed its agreement in principle. (4) Regarding the issue of German economic unification, the Soviet Union strongly advocated unification and demanded that Britain and the United States abolish the agreement signed on the economic merger of the two occupation zones; France, on the other hand, made the condition that it would accept German economic unification if the quantity of German coal imported into France was increased. (5) Regarding the issue of the German central government, Britain and the United States advocated that Germany adopt a federal system, but the Soviet Union favored Germany becoming a unified country. (6) Regarding the issue of the resettlement of German refugees, France believed that its own population was already very dense, and did not allow people to continue to move to Germany, and that non-Germans should not be allowed to reside in Germany; Britain expressed its disagreement. (7) Regarding the issue of the Ruhr area, the Soviet Union advocated joint management by the four powers, Britain demanded that the joint management method of the four powers should extend to the entire Germany; France, on the other hand, demanded that a special political system be established in the Ruhr area, which was again opposed by Britain. (8) Regarding the issue of German borders, the United States proposed returning Upper Silesia to Polish jurisdiction, and the areas occupied by Poland in eastern Germany should be returned to Germany. Molotov insisted that the German-Polish border should be divided in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Naturally, he expressed his opposition. Britain and France unanimously believed that: "Germany's borders were too far east after the First World War; and after the Second World War, they will be too far west." (9) Regarding the issue of the Four-Power Pact, Britain, the United States, and France unanimously supported it, but Molotov proposed amendments that made it impossible to establish. (10) Regarding the issue of the Austrian peace treaty, all issues have been resolved, but on the issue of German assets in Austria, the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are completely opposite. The Soviet Union's proposal is tantamount to making Austria bear some reparations. (11) Regarding the issue of convening a German peace conference, "the United States advocated that, in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, all countries that had been at war with Germany should participate in the German peace conference, but in the voting at the conference, the countries should be divided into two categories: those with voting rights and those without voting rights." The Soviet Union expressed its disagreement with this.</p>
<p>From the above, we can understand the outline of the US-Soviet dispute. Standing as a third party, and speaking fairly, the United States and the Soviet Union are consistent in principle and in understanding on how to deal with this defeated Germany; there is no difference between them; everyone wants to disarm Germany, purge the Nazi forces in Germany, and make its politics democratic, so that it can no longer rise again to threaten the peace and security of Europe; if the United States and the Soviet Union can both prioritize peace and not obsess over their own interests, then the Foreign Ministers Conference will not find it difficult to reach an agreement on these issues. However, the reason why there is so much controversy now, even to the point of bringing the conference to a standstill, is entirely due to the deep-seated prejudices of the four powers, especially the irreconcilable differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. Looking out at the world, not only is the sky in Moscow shrouded in haze; but also between the United States and the Soviet Union, there is a fog of suspicion and gloom. These days, the Security Council is discussing the US aid plan for Greece and Turkey, making the shores of Success Lake a gloomy world. Therefore, the mutual suspicion and mutual fear between the United States and the Soviet Union is a major tragedy of today's world; the fundamental reason for the difficulty in achieving post-war peace lies in this; the reason why the Moscow Conference has come to a standstill also lies in this. Therefore, Moscow observers say that only if the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union suddenly converge can the Foreign Ministers Conference continue; otherwise, it will end in discord. Therefore, we hope that the politicians and diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union will quickly use their political wisdom to dispel the clouds in the Moscow sky and shed a ray of sunshine on peace before it ends in discord.</p>
<p>In short, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference has reached its final stage, and success or failure will be known within the next week; all peace-loving people around the world are looking up at Moscow, hoping that the Foreign Ministers of the four powers will spread some news of peace, and not disappoint them again.</p>

<h3>Preamble to Austrian Peace Treaty Passed, But Foreign Ministers Conference Still Not Optimistic; Opinions of Four Powers on Southern Country's Demands Widely Divergent</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] Moscow Radio announced today that the entire preamble to the Austrian peace treaty was adopted by the Foreign Ministers Conference at its meeting on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Moscow, 20th - The four Foreign Ministers today discussed the Austrian peace treaty twice and reached an agreement. Molotov originally insisted that war criminals could be arrested in Austria without presenting evidence, but he has now abandoned this position. The British, American, and French Foreign Ministers believe that evidence should be presented before arresting war criminals in Austria, and Molotov has now agreed to this point. Apart from this, no agreement has been reached on any other important clauses.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 20th] Today's Foreign Ministers Conference, starting from the peace treaty, discussed the remaining eight clauses one by one, and re-examined the entire treaty. Except for the point on war criminals, no agreement was reached on any other key points. The second meeting of the four Foreign Ministers, originally scheduled for today, was temporarily canceled to give the Foreign Ministers' representatives an opportunity to work, but they agreed to hold two meetings tomorrow. In the morning, they will discuss the Trieste economic report, and in the afternoon, they will listen to the representatives' reports on Austria. The four Foreign Ministers also agreed that the Austrian peace treaty will not use the official German text. This was proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault, and the other three Foreign Ministers said that they had "no strong feelings" about it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th - The British, American, and French Foreign Ministers have rejected Yugoslavia's demand for territory from Austria. The three Foreign Ministers believe that Carinthia should not belong to Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Today's Foreign Ministers Conference discussed Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria and failed to reach an agreement, so it was decided to hand it over to the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting for further study, with a report to be submitted on Monday. In order to accelerate the discussion, the four Foreign Ministers decided to hold two meetings tomorrow, Sunday, exceptionally, both long and late. Yugoslavia's demands were supported only by Molotov. When discussing Yugoslavia's demand for reparations from Austria, Foreign Secretary Bevin revealed the secret historical record of the Potsdam Conference's decision not to demand reparations from Austria. At that time, the Soviet representative proposed that Austria should pay industrial products worth $250 million to the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia within six years from 1945. This was on July 24, 1945. However, the Economic Committee of the Potsdam Conference received the proposal for the first time and did not reach an agreement. Later, the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union studied the matter in Potsdam, and then submitted it to the three giants, Churchill, Stalin, and Truman, who finally reached a resolution agreeing not to demand reparations from Austria, and explicitly stipulated it in the Potsdam Agreement. Molotov still demanded consideration of Yugoslavia's demands on Austria. Bidault agreed with the British and American proposals in principle, but he also stated that France did not participate in the Potsdam Conference, but he was deeply moved by the opinions expressed by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister on Thursday, so he felt he did not know whether we could revoke Article 45 of the Austrian treaty to satisfy Yugoslavia's demands. This article stipulates that Austrian property within the United Nations or the proceeds from clearing such property should be returned to Austria. Bidault believed that Yugoslavia had suffered severe damage from the Austrians during the war, and could obtain some compensation by revoking the previous article. As for France, it still intends to return Austrian property within its territory, and wants other United Nations countries to be prepared to do so as well. It was finally decided that Article 45 of the Austrian treaty would be handed over to the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting for study in accordance with Bidault's proposal. The four Foreign Ministers then discussed Austria's borders. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France favored retaining the Austrian borders before the German annexation of Austria, while Molotov supported Yugoslavia's demand for part of the land in Carinthia Province. Marshall said that Yugoslavia's demands could not be accepted under any circumstances, so as not to seriously damage Austria's economy.</p>
<h3>It is rumored that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will close this week; the next conference may be convened in July</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 19th] Observers here recently said that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is likely to close on the 22nd or 23rd of this month, and to be convened in July of this year. Some observers have made this prediction based on the fact that the British and French delegations are currently making preliminary preparations to return to their countries. For example, previous residents of the Moscow Hotel have received notices that they can expect to move back into the hotel around April 25th. At present, only key members of the US delegation remain optimistic, or pretend to be optimistic, and say that the Foreign Ministers of the four countries will continue to meet for two or three weeks. But to make the Foreign Ministers Conference extend its session, a major miracle must occur, namely: (1) The views of the United States and the Soviet Union on the Four-Power Pact can converge; (2) The Soviet Union's hope to extract reparations from Germany's current industrial production can be reconciled with the hope of the United Kingdom and the United States to restore German industry to reduce their responsibility; otherwise, there is no hope for extending the conference. US Secretary of State Marshall made a final effort today, attempting to probe the Soviet Union's intentions, but the Soviet Union, disregarding the opinions of the three Foreign Ministers on the Austrian border issue and the reparations issue, insisted on its preconceived notions and was unwilling to budge. Marshall now fully understands that the Soviet Union cannot concede, even at the cost of not signing the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow. In short, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference is bound to adjourn, which is a major failure for Marshall. The mistake lies in the fact that Marshall directly attacked the Soviet Union on issues that the Soviet Union cannot concede (the reparations issue and the German-Polish border issue). This is what led to this result.</p>
<h3>Stalin Receives Deputy Prime Minister of Southern Country</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 19th] Moscow Radio recently issued a message stating that Marshal Stalin received Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj today for discussions. Yugoslav Ambassador to the Soviet Union Popović and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov were also present.</p>
<h3>British, American, and French to Conclude Agreement on German Coal Exports</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 19th] It is learned that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will soon conclude an agreement on the issue of coal exports from the British, American, and French occupation zones in Germany, but this agreement is not within the scope of discussion of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>Pravda Statement</h3>
<p>We Believe Soviet Union Wants to Separate British-American Relations</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 20th] A "Pravda" today we believe the Soviet Union suggested that a clause should be attached to the revised British-Soviet alliance treaty to disconnect the United Kingdom from the United States. (According to reports published by the New York Times last week by our agency, and commented on by our agency's diplomatic reporter, the slowness of the progress of negotiations on revising the British-Soviet alliance treaty has made Londoners suspect that the Soviet Union's purpose in raising the treaty issue may not be to jointly defend against German aggression, but to restrict the United Kingdom's contact with other countries.) "Pravda" denounced this speculation as laughable and unintentional. The report said: According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union's proposal does not contain such clauses. The Soviet Union has never opposed the United Kingdom establishing friendly relations with the United States or France, so there is no need to attach such a clause. If British-American or British-French cooperation is not aimed at the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union is very much in favor of it. The Soviet people firmly believe that friendly treaties between major powers should prohibit one of the contracting states from participating in groups that are detrimental to the other contracting state, regardless of what kind of disguise this participation is placed under.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Weijun Delivers Speech in United States, Discussing United Nations Organization; Deep Concern over Unresolved Disputes in German Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 19th] Chinese Representative to the United Nations Organization, Ambassador Gu Weijun, delivered a speech at the American Academy of Political and Social Science today, stating that there are no ideological groups in the United Nations Organization, but suspicion is inevitable. In fact, the only group in the United Nations Organization is those who are suspicious, and they always vote consistently on any issue. However, peace is a concern of every country, so the future of the United Nations Organization is full of hope. I do not believe that any country that has gone through the recent war does not want peace. World stability, the establishment of an international peacekeeping force, and the issues of disarmament and atomic control all depend on the successful negotiation of peace treaties with Germany and Japan. However, since the German peace treaty has been debated and unresolved, and the Japanese peace treaty is still awaiting consultation, thoughts of unease and misunderstanding will therefore permeate the world. Confidence in the future, although not completely shaken, has also been limited. This sense of alarm, especially in the countries leading the United Nations Organization, although it will not hinder the main work of the United Nations, will slow down its progress.</p>
<h3>Iraq Seeks to Restore the Saadabad Pact</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 19th] Since the British government announced that it would gradually withdraw British troops from Iraq, Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr has been negotiating with Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan to discuss the restoration of the 1937 Saadabad Pact. Political figures believe that Iraq's move can be regarded as an indication that Iraq intends to rely on the United States in the event of difficulties. However, this plan seems to be dissatisfied with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>US Diplomacy Turns Active, Determined to Suppress Communism</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The Washington correspondent of the Sunday Times said: We have ample reason to believe that the State Department, that is, the entire Truman administration, is engaged in a large-scale diplomatic operation to deal with communism throughout the world. Disappointment with the Moscow Conference, and the imminent passage of the aid to Greece and Turkey bill by the Senate, will lead to a more vigorous US foreign policy, supplemented by loans on an unprecedented scale, to provide other countries with manufactured goods and food. The aid to Greece and Turkey plan may be passed by the Senate on Tuesday. According to the current plan, a larger loan to South Korea will immediately follow, and then there will be other loans. When requesting Congress to pass these aid plans, the US government will strongly state that the world needs massive US aid to suppress communism. The State Department is well aware that US producers also urgently need foreign markets. Acting Secretary of State Acheson fully supports the anti-communist policy, and the debate on the aid to Greece bill has fully clarified the sincerity of US foreign policy. The Soviet Union also knows that the United States is indeed determined to oppose communism, or at least to defend against it. If the Senate passes the aid to Greece and Turkey bill on Tuesday, it will be only forty-one days since President Truman proposed it. The House of Representatives may also pass the bill soon. According to Congressional convention, the procedure has to be said to be rapid. In addition, President Truman has also proposed abolishing the Neutrality Act, all of which can indicate a shift in US diplomacy towards an active one.</p>
<h3>Regarding the U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan, Guo Taiqi Expresses His Views, Believing That This U.S. Action Does Not Damage the Prestige of the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] The main points of the statement made by my representative, Guo Taiqi, in the United Nations Security Council are as follows: In my capacity as the representative of China, I would like to say a few words about the plan proposed by the United States representative to aid Greece and Turkey, and to clarify to the Council the position of my delegation on the two proposals. It is generally believed that the aid plan under discussion is being carried out solely by the United States without going through the United Nations, which will damage the prestige of the United Nations. I would like to point out here that the masses of this great democratic country and the American newspapers were the first to criticize their government's policies in this way. I must say that the soundness of the American political system and the effective functioning of American democracy have left a deep impression on me. The Security Council would certainly have been pleased to receive notification from the U.S. representative at the time of President Truman's proposal to aid Greece on March 12, or before. In my capacity as the representative of China, I believe that the U.S. representative submitted to the Security Council a comprehensive report on the aid plan on March 28, before the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act became law. The U.S. government considers this plan to be aid to Greece and Turkey, and this move is of great significance. The Chinese delegation welcomes this statement, which itself clearly indicates that the United States does not intend to take action without going through the United Nations. I believe that the United States is the first member state to make such a statement in the Security Council for any international loan or international plan that the Security Council or the United Nations as a whole has not been notified of, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Danish Friendship Treaty Under Continued Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th] Regarding the rumor that the U.S. government has refused Denmark's request to abolish the 1941 U.S.-Danish agreement on the Greenland base, a spokesman for the Danish Embassy here recently denied it, saying that friendly negotiations are still underway, and it is hoped that the United States will begin to completely withdraw from the Greenland bases starting in 1948. According to the agreement, the United States has the right to station troops in Greenland.</p>
<h3>Moscow to Build Eight Skyscrapers</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 19th] The steel frames needed for the skyscrapers to be built here are being manufactured in the Molotov Factory in Dnepropetrovsk. According to Moscow's development plan, one 22-story skyscraper, two 26-story skyscrapers, and five 16-story skyscrapers will be built.</p>
<h3>Wallace Arrives in Norway</h3>
<p>[United Press, Capital of Norway, 19th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace originally planned to give one speech here, but it has now been expanded to four lecture hall speeches and one radio speech. Mr. Wallace was very popular here today, and was called "one of the most important voices of the common people." This statement was made by Mayor Brock of Nevik during the war. Mr. Brock and Norwegian Minister of Education Fostervoll jointly hosted a banquet to welcome Mr. Wallace. Representatives from the six major national parties all attended, including two cabinet members. Mr. Foss said that Mr. Wallace's ability to bring together representatives from the conservative Christian Democratic Party, the Labor Party, the Farmers' Party, and the Communist Party in one place is his only achievement. In his speech, Mr. Wallace strongly stated that any American law that prevents Americans from publicly criticizing their own government in foreign countries should be amended to comply with the charter of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Mr. Wallace mentioned that some people in the United States had proposed revoking Mr. Wallace's passport and using the Logan Act to sanction him. Mr. Wallace said, "Any citizen in the world who speaks the truth is merely declaring the provisions of the charter of the cultural and educational institution. I believe that any American law that conflicts with this charter will often be amended." During the banquet, a telegram from the American Farm Bureau was read, urging Wallace to continue his struggle and guaranteeing that the vast majority of Americans are echoing Wallace's sentiments. At the same time, French left-wing politician and former Minister of Air Force, Gutier, sent a telegram from Paris to welcome Wallace to France as an "old friend" and not as an agent of any political party.</p>
<h3>Dutch Prime Minister Inspects Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 19th] Dutch Prime Minister Beel and Colonial Minister Jonkman are expected to depart for Batavia on the 29th of this month for an inspection, staying in Indonesia for one week.</p>
<h3>U.S. Far East Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Regardless of whether Molotov accepts Marshall's proposal to resume negotiations on the unification of Korea, the United States is determined to implement its plan to provide five to six hundred million U.S. dollars in aid to Korea. If the unification of Korea can be achieved, the aid will be directed to the entire Korea, not limited to the south of Korea. Although the U.S. plan contains elements of psychological warfare to revive the south, if Korea can be unified, then this psychological weapon will not be necessary, and the plan to aid Korea will still be implemented. This is because Korea, whether unified or divided, is in dire need of this aid. Marshall's proposal to the Soviet Union to resolve the Korean issue is very timely. If Molotov can express agreement, then the United States can obtain what it hopes to obtain, namely the unification of Korea. If the Soviet Union's response does not indicate hope for a resolution in the near future, then Marshall will ask Congress to allocate funds for economic warfare to prevent the expansion of communism in the Far East. The U.S. policy towards the Republic of Indonesia has also become increasingly important in the past week. Some State Department officials have proposed "limited recognition" of the Republic of Indonesia. If this happens, it can give a rough idea of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia. Towards the increasingly independent Burma, the United States insists on its consistent policy of sympathizing with anti-fascist leaders. The U.S. upgrading of its embassy in Bangkok to an embassy also indicates the increasing importance the U.S. attaches to Thailand. When President Truman received the Thai ambassador this week, he said that he hoped that there would be a peaceful government in the area to ensure the safety and prosperity of the people. The State Department's preparations for the Japanese peace treaty have also reached a decisive stage. Experts are still discussing specialized economic and political issues in detail, but it is believed that it will soon be formally submitted to other allied countries. According to official estimates, the Japanese peace conference may be convened this autumn, possibly in October.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Firmly Opposes Continued Shipment of Lend-Lease Materials to the Soviet Union, Accusing the Government of Policy Contradictions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th, United Press] The U.S. Senate has rejected the State Department's desire to provide the Soviet Union with more lend-lease materials. Chairman Bridges of the Appropriations Committee firmly opposed the State Department's move, saying that Congressional passage would have to be submitted through the Senate Appropriations Committee, and this development is unlikely. Senate President Vandenberg said that before the $11.297 billion in wartime lend-lease materials to the Soviet Union is resolved, no more lend-lease materials should be shipped to the Soviet Union. The Senate at the time accused the government of simultaneously aiding Greece and Turkey to prevent communism while also supplying materials to the Soviet Union to assist communism. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the aid to Greece and Turkey bill on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>British Princess Elizabeth's Birthday</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The 21st is Princess Elizabeth's 21st birthday. St. Paul's Cathedral will ring bells to celebrate.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] British Princess Elizabeth turns 21 on Monday. From Piccadilly's nightclubs to the various districts of Wales, England is abuzz, with the Princess's birthday as the topic of conversation. In particular, people are eager to know what her 22nd year will be like. Will she marry? Will she get a new title? Will she live in a palace? We can get "yes" and "no" answers from countless self-proclaimed know-it-alls, all of whom are very certain, only the Cabinet and Buckingham Palace don't talk about it. The princess is eligible to marry at 21 years old. It is rumored that her engagement to Lieutenant Mountbatten of the former Greek group will be announced after she comes of age, but the royals in South Africa say that this is not the case. People close to Buckingham Palace also believe that the rumor that King George will grant Princess Elizabeth a new title is not credible.</p>

<h3>General Election Begins in Japan Yesterday, The Upper House is Directly Elected by the People for the First Time</h3>
<p>[Asia East News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Elections for the Japanese House of Councillors were held simultaneously across the country today. There are approximately 40 million voters. After the voting deadline, the ballots will be counted immediately, but due to the counting procedures, it will not be possible to complete all of them on the same day.

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] Japan's national general election began at 7:00 a.m. on the 20th. More than 38.35 million voters are facing their "important responsibility" of electing 250 new members of the House of Councillors to replace the original 355 members of the House of Peers. This means that the upper house of the Japanese Diet will be directly elected by the people for the first time. Police authorities told this agency that voting this morning was "very peaceful" and there was no damage. Candidates are not allowed to speak to voters near polling stations to avoid "affecting their freedom of choice." Today is Sunday, so there are not many people voting in the morning, but according to the Tokyo city authorities, the weather is beautiful and the results will be considerable by the time voting closes at 6:00 p.m. According to Kyodo News Agency, "conservative-leaning" candidates can win 171 of the 250 seats. Government authorities said that the imperial family will not participate in the election today because, according to the Imperial Household Law, they must maintain "political neutrality." This law will remain in effect until the new constitution is implemented on May 3.</p>
<h3>Soviet "Giant Child"</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 19th] Bovan, manager of the Danube River Shipping Company, recently told the press that the Soviet Union's representative on the Allied Control Commission has notified the company that it does not object to the resumption of navigation on the Danube River. The company is now proceeding with the resumption of navigation, and passenger and freight transportation on the river will soon be restored. In 1938, 3.5 million tons of goods were transported via the Danube River, of which Austrian shipping companies accounted for at least 20%.</p>

<h3>Measures for Confiscating and Seizing the Lease Rights of Traitors' Residences: If Family Members Reside Beyond What is Needed, They May Be Ordered to Vacate Part or All of the Residence</h3>
<p>Regarding the lease rights of traitors, the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office has recently formulated the following measures for implementation of confiscation and seizure: (1) After a judgment of confiscation of property is finalized, the lease rights of traitors shall be uniformly enforced in accordance with the law. However, due to the relationship of reserving living expenses for family members, the method of use should be determined after first considering the living conditions of the family members. (2) Before the judgment is finalized, the seizure of the lease rights of traitors, in addition to seizure according to law, shall be dealt with in accordance with the following methods: (a) If the rented house is not used and is in the care of someone, it shall be taken over; (b) If the traitor's family members live in a house that clearly exceeds the degree of need, or is a larger house, and it is deemed inappropriate for the family to live in, they may be ordered to vacate part or all of the house. However, if the house is only enough for the family to live in, the family may be allowed to temporarily keep and live in it; (c) If a third party lives in the house, their legal right to reside should be reviewed. If they are occupying the house without right, they should be ordered to move out; (d) If the lease rights of traitors expire after the victory, in accordance with customary practice or contract stipulations, the lessee has the priority to continue the lease. The lessor shall not establish a new lease contract with a third party for the house used by the original lessee. (3) When implementing the above measures, the assistance of judicial organs such as military camps may be requested in accordance with the law. The above measures have been approved by the Clearing and Pseudo-Property Review Committee and reported to the Executive Yuan for record before they can be implemented.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of the Buyer of Yu Qiaqing's Estate: A 12-Mu Property on Chengdu Road, Disputes Between Brothers After the Sale</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It has been two years since Yu Qiaqing, a former business magnate in Shanghai, passed away in Chongqing in the spring of the 34th year of the Republic of China. Yu's huge estate in Shanghai during his lifetime is now being sorted out by the "Estate Sorting Committee." Recently, a thought-provoking property rights dispute suddenly occurred. Both parties commissioned lawyers to publish advertisements in the newspaper, attacking each other. The reporter inquired about the details from both parties and compiled them as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Qiao has three sons: the eldest is named Shun'en, the second is named Shunmao, and the third is named Shunwei. During the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, after Yu went to the mainland, his property and business in Shanghai were managed by Shun'en. Unfortunately, Mr. Qiao died in Chongqing in the spring of the year before the Japanese surrender. After the victory, the heirs of Mr. Qiao's estate organized an "Estate Sorting Committee" to handle all the estate. A month ago, the eldest brother, Shun'en, reported to the "Sorting Committee" that two properties on Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, totaling twelve mu and six li and six hao, and all buildings had been sold to a real estate merchant named Yu Shunyuan in early February of this year, for a total price of 158 taels of gold (each tael weighing ten taels), of which 20 taels were deducted for interest (due to previous loans) and 7 taels for commission. Shunmao and Shunwei believed that the property was jointly owned and that the eldest brother could not dispose of it alone. Moreover, since the property was worth more than 1,000 taels of gold at the time, Shun'en sold it at a cheap price of one-tenth, and the buyer was named "Yu Shunyuan," which made them suspicious, thinking that "Shunyuan" might be an alias for Shun'en, and that the buying and selling behavior was also a mystery made up by Shun'en. They commissioned three lawyers, Jiang Pingfan, Duanmu Kai, and Li Chaonian, to publish a statement in the newspaper, stating that the property rights of the property were jointly owned by the three of them, and could not be transferred or burdened without the consent of all the co-owners. The next day, attorney Hong Shihao, representing Yu Shunyuan, refuted and declared the property rights in an advertisement. According to Attorney Hong's statement to the reporter: Yu Shunyuan is from Wujin and has been in the real estate business for decades. He definitely exists and is not an alias deliberately created by others. The seller of the property is Yu Shun'en, and the names of Xu Shunmao and Yu Shunwei are not listed on the property certificate or registration procedures, nor is there any record of co-ownership. Moreover, Yu Shun'en stated in writing: "It is definitely self-produced and self-sold, and there are no entanglements of any rights of the family or third parties." He also said: As for Yu Shunmao and Yu Shunwei's suspicion that Yu Shunyuan is an alias for Yu Shun'en, it is a foolish guess. If Xu Shun'en used an alias to replace him, why not create another surname and insist on using the word "Yu Shun" to cause suspicion? How could there be such an unwise person? Yu Shunyuan is a completely unrelated second person, only his name is coincidental. Although only Shunmao and Shunwei have come forward to interfere, how could they know so much about the buying and selling process? It is impossible not to suspect that they are in cahoots, and the three brothers are trying to overturn the completed sale, etc. However, according to Yu Shunmao and Shunwei, "Yu Shunyuan" definitely does not exist. The so-called Wujin origin refers to a certain Yu in the Zhejiang Xingye Bank. Yu is also an important person in the case because he was the original handler of the buying and selling of this property. The contact information of a true Shunyuan" can also be transferred through him. He once told people that this property was entrusted to him by a French priest to purchase it under an alias, etc.</p>
<p>Whether this case is a genuine property rights dispute or a variant of an inheritance dispute, the reporter has no way of knowing. However, Yu Shun'en swore an oath to the two brothers Shunmao and Shunwei, stating that this sale did occur. Shunwei and Shunmao resolutely stated that they could not give up ownership of the property. Jiang Yiping is now mediating between the two as the elder brother-in-law, so there is no litigation for the time being.</p>

He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but succumbed to his injuries and died. After an investigation by the police, it was learned that the deceased was named Yu Jingshan, from Ningbo. He had been an elementary school teacher in this city. After losing his job, he was introduced by a friend to work as a laborer at the Huaxing Clothing Company at 250 Fujian Road. Recently, due to rising prices and a meager monthly income, he found it difficult to support his family and thus committed suicide in despair.

<h3>Pan Gongzhan Speaks on News and Advertising; This Newspaper Held Its Third Weekly Broadcast Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] This newspaper held its third special Sunday broadcast at the Yameilin Radio Station yesterday. Mr. Wu Zhihui, a veteran of the Party and the nation, was originally invited to give a speech, but was unable to attend due to other engagements. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, delivered a speech on "News and Advertising." The full text of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"The general public divides the content of newspapers into two parts: news and advertising. Advertising revenue can sustain the news business, and the power of news can attract advertising. The two are mutually beneficial. However, if we look deeper, ordinary people think that advertising is merely a tool for businesses to attract customers. From the newspaper's perspective, advertising is also news. For example, a major company's clearance sale advertisement, which lists the types of goods, the low prices, and provides customers with references and choices, is news. As another example, someone who has lost stocks or contracts publishes a notice in the newspaper declaring them void. On the surface, it is purely advertising, but in reality, it is also news, because by seeing this advertisement, you will not buy something that is no longer valid and suffer unnecessary losses. This kind of advertisement already has the function of news. Because advertising has a significant impact, we should pay as much attention to the content, potential effects, and value of advertising as we do to news.</p>
<p>Accepting Advertising Requires Prior Review</p>
<p>After receiving an advertisement, the newspaper must first review whether its content is factual, accurate, and whether it deceives readers or gives readers a negative impression. It is not that any advertisement will be published as long as there is an advertising fee. Publishing an advertisement that deceives readers has the same impact on readers as publishing an inaccurate news item. The newspaper is equally responsible. This is the spirit that Shen Bao upholds. With a history of over seventy years, it has always been very cautious about publishing advertisements. Advertisements that deceive readers will not be published, even if the advertising fee is ten times higher. Our view of the value of advertising is not based on its size, location, or order of publication. We base it on its impact on culture and education. Due to strict restrictions, revenue will naturally suffer initially, but over time, as trust is established in society, companies, shops, and factories will be happy to publish advertisements that are valued by the public, and the results will inevitably yield the rewards they deserve.</p>
<p>Many News Items Also Have Advertising Value</p>
<p>Conversely, news also has advertising value. Because it is not easy to publish a news item, newspaper space is limited. Taking this newspaper as an example, with two and a half pages of newspapers each day, after removing advertising, the remaining space must be used to publish domestic and foreign news. It is truly complex and countless. Therefore, every news item is carefully selected and not published casually. Once published, if 100,000 copies of the newspaper are sold, and on average ten people read one copy of the newspaper, then one million people will see it. If 200,000 copies of the newspaper are sold, then two million people will see it. This is equivalent to doing free advertising for something, which is the advertising effect of news. For example, government announcements or laws are advertisements, but they can also be published in the form of news. It is very difficult for general companies, shops, and factories to publish a news item on a newspaper with limited space, but if there is such an unknown small shop whose goods are indeed cheap and of good quality, or an unknown small factory whose products are indeed genuine, our newspaper is happy to promote them.</p>
<p>Thinking of Readers, Serving Society</p>
<p>It is not to promote a shop or a factory, but to serve society and think of readers. Even if a company, shop, or factory has not commissioned an advertisement, we must take on the responsibility of reporting. This newspaper wholeheartedly serves readers, first combining news and advertising into one, and then using the power of broadcasting to combine readers, listeners, and companies, shops, and factories into one, hoping that both the production and consumption aspects of society can benefit from Shen Bao's services. This is our contribution to society."</p>
<h3>Famous Performers Gather; Excellent Program, Hard to Match</h3>
<p>Yesterday was this newspaper's third special Sunday broadcast. The Peking opera program was exceptionally wonderful. In addition to the complete "Sangyuan Hui" by famous performer Fan Shiren and his wife, Miss Zhu Shengqing's "Entrusting Dreams at the Monument," and Mr. Shen Bainian's "Life and Death Hate," famous performer Zhao Tongshan also sang "Chunxiang Enlightening Learning" (accompanied by the flute king Xu Baiqiu), Miss Wu Husheng of the Ju Society performed "Cosmic Seal," Miss Fu Ronghua performed "Ten Judgements" (Yan School), Mr. Gu Wenshao performed "The Drunken Concubine," and Mr. He Shixi and Mr. Zhang Zhesheng performed "Battle of the Heroes to Capture the Gais." This time, famous drummer Wei Xiyun also helped with the drumming, and the famous musicians Fu Baojing and Dang Yunliang brothers played the strings, which was especially rare and wonderful. After the Peking opera, there was Kunqu opera, Zhang Yuanhe and Yi Er Xiaojie's "Hongli Ji Ting Hui," Zhao Jingshen and his wife Li Xitong's "Pipa Ji Pan Fu," Miss Fang Yingda's "Hongli Ji A Visit," Shen Bainian's "Assassinating Hu," Miss Yin Junong's "Handan Dream Sweeping Flowers Three Drunks," Wu Jichuan's "Qin Tiao," Zhao Jingshen's "Qiao Vinegar," Wang Yi Er Xiaojie's "Lou Hui," Yin Junong Xiaojie and Gu Taitai's duet "Chang Sheng Dian Xiaoyan," which did not end until 12:00.</p>
<h3>Neighboring Metropolis, Tiny Shanghai County; Handover between New and Old County Magistrates; Only 300,000 Yuan Left in Cash; Poverty Hinders Local Development</h3>
<p>[Special Report by This Newspaper] Shanghai County and Shanghai City, although only one character apart in name, are worlds apart in form and substance. Although Shanghai County is closely adjacent to Shanghai City, in every aspect, it is like a general township in the interior, still stagnating in a backward stage.</p>
<p>Shanghai County is the smallest county in Jiangsu Province. Although its current total area is more than 250,000 mu, in terms of the county's population and income, it is not as good as the smallest "district" in Shanghai City. This makes people realize that a district chief in Shanghai City is, in fact, equivalent to a state governor.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government is located in Minhang Town, sixty li outside the South City. Yesterday, the reporter drove to visit. Along the way, rapeseed flowers were everywhere, and green willows swayed. Leaving the hustle and bustle of the city, I immediately felt refreshed. The urban area of Minhang Town is very small, the two main streets are narrow and cramped, the market is bleak, and the whole scene is desolate. After eight years of the War of Resistance, the general sideline business of the people of Shanghai County is to manufacture matchboxes for Shanghai match merchants with the most original labor. The price of one thousand matchboxes is 3,000 yuan, and the middlemen enjoy one-half without deduction. The hard workers actually get only 1,500 yuan, and they have to provide the paste themselves. "Sir, it is not easy to make one thousand matchboxes a day from morning to night!" they said. However, there is a surplus of labor in the countryside, and everyone is scrambling for this cheap business.</p>
<p>The prices in the county town follow Shanghai City, as easily as directing one's arm. These days, white rice in Minhang is also fluctuating around 180,000 yuan. You can't find anything cheaper than Shanghai here, only the eggs unique to the general countryside, which only sell for 300 yuan each. Whole batches of native cloth, because there is no large market, the cloth merchants are sitting there dozing.</p>
<p>At noon, the reporter visited the County Middle School and the Shanxin National School. Xue Huikang, the principal of the County Middle School, is a respected veteran educator in the area. When he saw the reporter, he was as friendly as meeting a kindred spirit, and pulled me to visit the dilapidated classrooms and the students' dormitories and dining halls that he struggled to maintain. Teachers and students alike stood there eating vegetarian meals. The teachers' monthly salary of only 300,000 yuan is already two months in arrears. It is said that all kinds of salaries in the county are like this. The former county magistrate Ni Youxiang left, leaving a finance section chief to handle the handover. The new county magistrate took office and received only 300,000 yuan in cash. Everyone knows that there is little revenue for county government expenses now, so they can't ask the new county magistrate for debts, and they have to wait patiently.</p>
<p>The new county magistrate, Yu Yueqiu, used to be a professor at Tongji University. He arrived in the county on the 2nd of this month. He is facing the debts left by the former county magistrate. He is planning with local people how to balance future revenue and expenditure. According to County Magistrate Yu, the county's annual land tax revenue is more than 900 million yuan, and various taxes are about 20 million yuan per month. 50% is paid to the central and provincial governments, and 50% (about 400 million yuan) is retained for local use. The county's security team has more than 130 people, each with a salary of less than 10,000 yuan. There are more than 80 police officers, with a monthly salary of 20,000 yuan. In order to maintain local security, it is planned to train volunteer police and strengthen the organization of self-defense teams. Recently, a small number of bandits were discovered looting between Sanlintang and Chenxing in the county, and they are being suppressed. Among the 120,000 people in the county, there are more than 200 smokers. A general inspection is scheduled for June 1 this year to reorganize the baojia system and check household registrations. In other aspects of land administration, society, education, construction, and health, County Magistrate Yu gave detailed explanations of his plans in turn. In the end, in one sentence, the income is too little, and it is inevitable that the actual implementation will be discounted.</p>
<p>It was learned from other local people that they wanted to increase the surtax by 2 jiao per mu in addition to the land tax to help the county government's operations. This proposal will be submitted to the County Council for discussion.</p>
<p>The problem of Shanghai County is the same as the situation in various parts of China today: "poverty." The poverty of financial and material resources hinders the development of local undertakings.</p>
<h3>Conflict Over Buying Fresh Meat in Bulk; Shop Assistant Wields Axe to Chop Competitor</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At the Huashan Road small vegetable market, yesterday morning, when the market was at its peak, Li Dechang, who set up a fresh meat stall, having sold out all his pork, bought more than 30 jin of fresh meat in bulk from the meat stall set up by Yin Fusheng next door. During weighing, a dispute arose due to insufficient weight, leading to a conflict. At that time, a shop assistant named Gu Guoqing actually chopped at Li's head with a meat-chopping axe. Li quickly dodged and was not hit, but Peng Zhenglin, a competitor standing beside him, was caught off guard and was hit in the left shoulder by the axe. He immediately fell to the ground injured, bleeding profusely. People then called the police on duty to the scene, and the assailant was arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. The injured person was taken to Baoji Hospital for treatment by car.</p>

<h3>Once an Enemy Secret Agent; Framed Father and Son Villagers; Li Xiaosi Arrested While Strolling in Garden</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Hu Zixiao, 34, from Baoshan, is in the printing business and currently works at No. 55, Lane 779, Chengdu North Road. Hu's uncle, Guiyan, lives in Baojia Building, Yangxi Township, Baoshan, farming for a living and has a small fortune. On a certain day in May of the 29th year of the Republic, Li Xiaosi (41 years old), a fellow villager who had served as an enemy secret agent, framed Guiyan and his son Zigan, accusing them of being Chongqing elements and guides for the Japanese military police, and arrested the father and son. By 6:00 AM the next morning, the bodies of Hu's father and son were found, killed on the wasteland at the corner of Baojia Building. At that time, the family was helpless because they were afraid of his power. After the victory, Hu Zixiao filed a complaint with the Baoshan County Government, but Li escaped to other places and was never apprehended. At 11:30 AM yesterday morning, Li was wandering around the Outer Garden with his mistress Xie Jinmei when Hu Zixiao spotted him. He called the police at post No. 2767, and they were both arrested and taken to the Huangpu Police Bureau. After interrogation, the case became clear. Because the crime scene was under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County, he will be brought back for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University's Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Department May Be Reorganized and Continued; Alumni Association to Meet Tonight to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At the Jiaotong University Alumni Association meeting during the school anniversary celebration, the alumni's opinions were solicited regarding Jiaotong University's plan to reorganize the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering and continue its operation. At that time, Vice Minister Ling Hongxun represented the Ministry of Communications and expressed a written opinion: "Hongxun absolutely advocates continuing the operation: (1) Jiaotong University used to have this department, (2) This department has a related relationship with other departments of the university, (3) Naval architecture and marine engineering are both disciplines related to transportation, and it is extremely appropriate for Jiaotong University to run this department. (4) The domestic and foreign shipping industries are actively developing, and there is an urgent need for talent, so there is no reason to discontinue it. (5) The Ministry of Communications is also entrusting Jiaotong University to train a large number of naval architecture and marine engineering talents, allocating funds to purchase equipment, and setting up lectureships, which is being reported to the Executive Yuan for approval, so it should not be terminated." However, the Alumni Association's letter to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education has been sent for many days and has not yet been approved. Therefore, on the 18th of this month, the Alumni Association sent representatives Zhang Gongwei and Wang Jinlin to Beijing to consult with the Ministry of Communications again. Vice Minister Ling received them, and Director Li of the Navigation Administration Department explained that the Ministry of Communications had previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for an appropriation of 1 billion yuan to add equipment and lectureships at Jiaotong University, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Therefore, he expressed great sympathy for the Alumni Association's request to the Ministry of Education to approve the reorganization and continuation of the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, and expressed absolute support. Before the conversation was over, Minister Yu also arrived and believed that Jiaotong University's Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering must continue to operate. At this point, the representatives were satisfied and left, and have now returned to Shanghai. It is heard that the Alumni Association is scheduled to hold a symposium tonight to discuss the next steps.</p>

The two teams went back and forth, with many changes, and the whole game was a seesaw battle. The audience of 5,000 people mostly came from the soccer field, using bread as rations, truly basketball fans.</p>
<p>Both sides performed well last night, which was satisfying. Hualian's Bao Songyuan scored 18 points alone, which was indispensable. Cheng Zhang's steals, Xue Chong's sprints, Guangyi's long shots, and Xiangcheng's conservativeness all had their strengths. Shantou Team's Lide and Weicong performed heroically. Last night, they were agile, Qingjiang took care of both the front and back, and Canxi blocked well. Although they lost by only two points, it was both fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<p>Hualian Fights Hard; One Point Ahead</p>
<p>Before the game, the photographers were busy taking photos. After each team took photos, they took a group photo. Only six people were photographed into the lens of Hualian. Li Zhenzhong leaned against the wall, quietly watching and appreciating under the slogan "Please Keep Order to Appreciate Technology" in the gymnasium.</p>

As the whistle sounded, Chen Qingjiang jumped up in front of the basket and threw the ball in amidst the chaos, and the audience shouted "Strange ball!" A Di Xue Chong succeeded one after another, and Shantou Team still led with 8 to 6, but also wanted to take a timeout to dampen the opponent's spirit. Lao Bao made a free throw with one hand, and Xue Chong scored another goal. Hualian surpassed by 9 to 8 with a score of one point.</p>
<p>The Situation is Tense and Halftime Ends</p>
<p>A Kong calmly made a long shot, and Lin Weicong returned the favor. Kong revisited the old place, and Bao added a goal, with Shantou Team trailing by five points at 15 to 10. Xiangcheng, Qingjiang, and Xue Chong made no mistakes on free throws. He Lide threw in a goal with a pushing posture. A Kong made his third long shot. Lao Bao, Yanxiong, and Weicong competed for the ball. Shantou Team took another timeout. There were only three seconds left in the first half. As a result, Hualian led by six points at 23 to 17 in a tense state.</p>
<p>Shantou Team Launches a Fierce Attack and Surpasses by Three Points</p>
<p>After the break, Shantou Team replaced Weicong with Ji Nankang. He Lide made the first contribution. The opponent Lao Bao made a free throw. In an instant, Qingjiang, Lide, and A Cai scored five points with two throws and one free throw (25 to 24), and Hualian had only one more point. Bao made a free throw, and Cai scored. The situation turned into a tie at 26 points again. Hualian took another timeout. Cai made a free throw and surpassed by one point. Under the cheers of the audience for Shantou Team, He Lide lived up to expectations and led by three points. At this time, Hualian was flustered. When Ren Xiangcheng broke through and scored, A Di also scored, and it was easy to chase out with 30 to 29.</p>
<p>The Last Two Minutes Decide the Outcome</p>
<p>Xue Chong grabbed the ball at the bottom of the basket and scored. Lin made a throw and Cai made a free throw. Shantou Team was still behind by one point with 34 to 33. At that time, A Kong closely guarded Cai, but both of his free throws missed. He Lide scored at the basket and chased out by one point with 34 to 35. Qingjiang made another free throw and scored two more points. Lao Bao, Weicong, and Lao Bao tied the score at 38. Bao made a free throw and scored one more point with 39 to 38. Ren Xiangcheng graduated and was replaced by Zhuo. Qingjiang graduated and Ji entered as a substitute. Hualian took their fifth timeout in the last eight seconds.

<h3>Ever-Victorious Army Suffers Unprecedented惨败; Seoul Team Wins Big Over Donghua; Two Goals Scored in Each Half</h3>
<p>The Seoul soccer team expedition team played their fourth friendly match in Shanghai against the ever-victorious Donghua team at the Yiguo Stadium yesterday. The fans were shaken by the reputation of the two teams, with an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 people. The road on Shaanxi Road was crowded with vehicles and horses. The ticket office of the Municipal Gymnasium almost created an unprecedented盛况, and there was no vacant seat in the Bing area of Yiyuan Stadium. Fortunately, the police maintained order effectively, and the order was still good. Dr. Syngman Rhee, the leader of Korea, also came to the stadium yesterday to watch the game, so the morale of the visiting team was even higher. As a result, Donghua was severely poisoned by the visiting team with a score of zero to four because Lao鐔's long-term injury did not heal, and Jia Youliang was injured and left the field. The lineups of both sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Seoul</p>
<p>Che Chunjong Park Daejong Park Gyujeong Min Byeongdae Kim Gyuhwan Ju Yeonggwang Jeong Gukjin Kim Yongshik Jeong Namje Oh Gyeonghwan Wu Jinghwan</p>
<p>Donghua</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun Zhuang Youren Zhang Lingen Liang Shutang Han Longbo鐔Fuzhen Yu Qiaxing Li Yao Sun Jinshun Han Longhai Dai Linjing Jia Youliang (Up), Chen Mingzhe (Down)</p>
<p>The Expeditionary Force Opens the Record First</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM, referee He Chunhui, and linesmen Deng Xiaoliang and Chen Jixiang, took the stage to enforce the law. The two teams took a group photo together. After the captains of Donghua and the visiting team exchanged team flags, the game began. Seoul was against the sun and attacked with the wind. Kim Yongshik and Jeong Namje had shots on goal, and Zhuang and Lingen saved the situation one after another. Donghua attacked but did not gain anything. In the melee to the eighth minute, the visiting team launched an attack. Jeong Gukjin launched a surprise attack on the cold road, swept into the net from the crowd at the fourteen-yard mark, Zhang Banglun's vision was blocked, and he lost his hand, and the visiting team took the lead with a score of one to zero. For the loss of this ball by Donghua, Zhang Lingen was negligent and should bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>Twelve-Yard Mark, Donghua is Deceived Again</p>
<p>Donghua counterattacked, and Youliang advanced rapidly on the border, passing the ball in the center with one foot at the appropriate point, but Longhai did not get the header, and A Dai also had a shot, but it was too wild. In the seventeenth minute, the visiting team launched a large-scale attack. Oh Gyeonghwan and Jeong Namje had repeated shots on goal, and Zhuang's business was booming. In the melee to the twenty-fifth minute, Jia Youliang was injured in his leg and left the field. After bandaging, he re-entered the field. In the thirty-sixth minute, Lao鐔's fatigue was fully revealed, and the visiting team took advantage of the situation to enter. Jeong Namje made a cold shot, and the momentum was fierce and dangerous. Zhang Banglun pounced and captured it, and the audience applauded thunderously. One minute before the end of the first half, Zhang Lingen was eager to save the ball in the penalty area, kissed the ball with his hand, and committed a twelve-yard major crime. The visiting team was penalized by right-wing two Jinghuan, and the ball was extremely tricky. Banglun pounced in vain, two to zero, Donghua lost another city, and the first half ended.</p>
<p>Seoul Team Scores Three Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After changing sides, Seoul remained unchanged, Donghua Jia Youliang retired, and a nephew Chen Mingzhe filled the gap. After the center circle kick-off, Dai Yuanlao and Han General used both pipes, and A Dai shot hard, and Che Chunjong pounced it out. After five minutes,鐔Fuzhen also said goodbye, Liang Shutang filled in, and Han Longbo served as the center. Donghua's lineup became even weaker. In the tenth minute, Jeong Namje went it alone and went straight into Donghua's hinterland. Zhang Banglun saw that there were few people in the back defense and rushed out to save, but it was a pity that the ball was not far away and was still at Xiang Nanje's feet. Banglun had no time to turn back and shoot, three to zero, and another city was lost</p>
<p>Four to Zero, Unprecedented慘败</p>
<p>Although Donghua launched a large-scale counterattack, the visiting team's defense was strict and there was no gap to enter, and the visiting team had abundant long-term strength, and the five fronts had shooting performances from time to time. In the twenty-third minute, Longhai and Mingzhe exchanged positions, but they still did not make any progress. Three minutes later, Jeong Namje crossed Han Longbo and shot hard with his foot. Banglun pounced in vain and was lost again, resulting in a score of four to zero. In the thirtieth minute, Longhai got a corner kick opportunity, but Mingzhe's head was not effective. In the melee to five minutes before the end of the game, Seoul midfielder Zhu Rongguang was injured by Sun's iron leg due to fighting for the ball. Fortunately, there was no major problem. Before long, the statutory time was over, and Donghua was brutally poisoned by the visiting team with a score of zero to four. The Municipal Association and Sporting Goods Company, in order to encourage the morale of the visiting team, specially presented the Tianzi football, the honorary product of the company, and a pennant to the Seoul expedition team yesterday.</p>

<h3>Boston Dunlap Song Race; Korean Player Wins Championship; Xu Renfu Creates New Record</h3>
<p>[United Press, Boston, 19th] The 51st Boston Marathon was held in Boston today. Korean Xu Renfu won the championship and created a new record with two hours, twenty-five minutes and thirty-nine seconds. Mr. Xu is 24 years old and a student at Qixian University. He led from the start and did not lose his strength until the end. Finnish player Haitainan won second place, and Xu and Hai ran side by side for nearly six miles, without distinguishing themselves, until they ran to "Heartbreak Hill" before they separated, because the slope of the hill was steep and difficult to climb. Most long-distance runners have been frustrated here in the past. Mr. Xu strode over the hillside, and he was like a horse off the leash, leading far away, and when he reached the finish line, he still had the courage to drum. Another Korean, Nam Seung-yong, ranked twelfth, and Sun Jizhen, the marathon champion of the last World Games, failed to make the list. The entire marathon is twenty-six miles and three hundred and eighty-five yards. The old record was two hours, twenty-six minutes, and fifty-one seconds, which was created by American Smith five years ago. Mr. Smith also participated in the competition today, but withdrew after twenty-three miles.</p>

<h3>Basketball Sidelines</h3>
<p>Hualian and Shanteam fought last night for the championship of the Class 1 Group A Basketball League, and the City Stadium was once again packed.

In the final moments, Bao Songyuan and Wu Chengzhang made two free throws, securing the title.</p>
<p>Da Li was absent from yesterday's game, and the entire Hualian team seemed to have lost its center of gravity, falling behind 2-8 at the start. In the first half, Kong Guangyi's long shot had unexpected results, quickly scoring three goals, and the Soviet Union took the lead with these valuable six points.</p>
<p>Strategically, both sides had exhausted all their efforts. Shanteam remained determined to cherish every opportunity to score, never wasting them, and coupled with accurate shooting skills. In defense, they tried to control the three shooters of Hualian, with Cai Yanxiong guarding Wu Chengzhang, He Lide guarding Chen Xuechong, and Ma Canxi guarding Bao Songyuan. Of these, Cai's defense of Wu was most successful in the first half.</p>
<p>Due to Da Li's absence, Hualian had no one to lead the way and find openings. Lao Bao, as center, also had to take care of protecting the basket, which was an unfamiliar position. Lao Kong found it very difficult to watch Lin Weizong, but Xiao Lin's shooting last night had not reached his peak condition, and Xiang Cheng was only responsible for watching Qingjiang, preventing his movements.</p>
<p>In the second half, Ji Nankang replaced Xiao Lin, and Shanteam scored five consecutive goals, while Hualian only made four free throws. Hualian once trailed by as many as three points. At this time, A Di and Xuechong took advantage of the narrowest of opportunities to shoot from extremely difficult angles, managing to maintain the balance.</p>
<p>Shanteam's performance was flawless, and one missed shot was not enough to determine victory or defeat. In fact, given Hualian's current situation, they would never have faced such a great threat from anyone other than Shanteam. (Changnian)</p>
<h3>Rural Construction and Universal National Education</h3>
<p>— Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>Although there are thousands of things to be done in China's construction, the fundamental work should still start with rural construction. Our discussion of rural construction problems still focuses on education, or in other words, using the power of education to enlighten farmers' knowledge, increase farmers' production, strengthen farmers' physique, and cultivate farmers' habits of cooperation and unity. Since ancient times, China has taken "teaching and nurturing together" as the guideline for local administration. Now, in building the countryside, we must use the power of education, which is the same principle. Let's cite a few obvious facts to prove that national construction must first build the countryside, and that building the countryside must first universalize national education.</p>
<p>First, for thousands of years, China has been an agricultural country. The food and clothing needed by the people of the whole country, the raw materials for light industry, and the materials needed for inter-port international trade come directly and indirectly from the countryside. Therefore, the lifeline of the people of the whole country lies in the vast and scattered countryside.</p>
<p>Second, more than 90 percent of the country's land belongs to the countryside. Looking at the population, lifestyle, and production technology, at least nine-tenths of the country's counties and cities still belong to rural society, and at least three or four rural areas exist within each county. There are nearly one million rural societies of varying sizes throughout the country, so the countryside is the foundation for organizing the country.</p>
<p>Third, the national population is estimated to be 450 million, at least four-fifths of whom live in the countryside. Most of the residents in these rural areas are illiterate farmers. To build our nation, we must eliminate the illiteracy of four-fifths of the national population.</p>
<p>From the above three points, we can already reach the conclusion that building the country must first build the countryside, and building the countryside should first popularize national education. Moreover, Sun Yat-sen, the founding father, specifically pointed out the importance of establishing schools in the Law on the Implementation of Local Autonomy, which also shows us the possibility and necessity of building the countryside through education. We should follow this instruction and further study the methods of implementation.</p>
<p>Using the method of universal national education to build the countryside, apart from the two practical problems of teachers and economy, which will not be discussed in detail in this article, two innovative beliefs are really needed in terms of educational theory—or it can even be said that they are two firm guidelines: First, education should be coordinated with production; Second, education should be integrated with life. The former is the driving force for teaching and supporting the people. Teaching and nurturing farmers with production as the center, they will feel the need for education. The latter is the starting point for governing and protecting the people, using education to enable farmers to manage and defend themselves. Such rural national education takes the actual life of farmers as the object of educational facilities and agricultural production as the goal of educational facilities. If the farmers' lifestyle is improved and agricultural production is prosperous, the purpose of building the countryside through the educational process can also be achieved. Isn't the power of education the driving force for building the countryside? The following is a further explanation of the sub-items:</p>
<p>(1) Rural National Education and Rural Production Cooperation: The basic occupation in China's rural areas is still agriculture, so the most important goal of rural national education facilities should be to increase agricultural production. Some people in our country advocate rural national education, some focus on literacy education, and some focus on civic education, but regardless of literacy education or civic education, agricultural production should always be the center of national education facilities. For example, animal husbandry, afforestation, water conservancy, horticulture, breeding, and rural small-scale industries are all coordinated with literacy education or fully applied to civic education. Such implementation of rural national education is the work that farmers need to do every day, and its function is like proper sunlight and rain. All kinds of crops, after being nurtured by sunlight and rain, will flourish and grow. Ask any farmer who doesn't like sunlight and rain! For the same reason, if agricultural production can be gradually increased through the national education of rural areas, ask any farmer who does not need the popularity of national education! Therefore, the reason why rural national education is not developed is not so much because of insufficient funding as it is because education is not coordinated with production.</p>
<p>(2) Rural National Education and Rural Life Integration: Undoubtedly, the promotion of rural national education should follow the regulations and establish schools in townships and villages, but we must know that schools are only limited places for teaching. To implement the true spirit of national education, we must also pay attention to the infinite new field of national education, which is the entire rural society. The former's power, in the national education process, is of course the base for propaganda and demonstration, and the latter is the focus of rural national education. Engaging in rural national education should adhere to the base and promote its central work. If rural national education is not carried out with the entire rural society as its teaching field and the entire people as its teaching object, two opposite phenomena will result: First, schools are easily made into consumer institutions; Second, education will not meet the needs of farmers. These two phenomena weaken the function of national education, and as a result, the mission of national schools to build the countryside will never be realized!</p>
<p>In short, when schools and society are integrated, education and life naturally melt together! When education and production are coordinated, schools and construction naturally become one! This theory is originally the true meaning of national education and is naturally most applicable to the current rural construction in our country. We know that the countryside is the most extensive grassroots level in China. To establish the country from the grassroots level is to build the foundation of the country. Therefore, using the popularization of national education to build the countryside, on the one hand, solves the education problem of the vast population of the whole country, and on the other hand, embarks on the road to building a new China.</p>

<h3>To Curb Rising Cotton Yarn Prices, Authorities Decide to Adopt Emergency Measures; Private Yarn Factories Eagerly Await the Implementation of New Control Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the central authorities believe that the recent price fluctuations in the Shanghai market, especially the soaring price of cotton yarn, seem to have entered a rampant state, which is not appropriate. Therefore, they are about to take emergency measures, formulate several prohibitions, and hand them over to the Shanghai Municipal Government and relevant agencies for implementation in order to curb the unreasonable rise in cotton yarn prices and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Private Textile Business Cannot Be Maintained</p>
<p>In recent days, the price of yarn in the Shanghai market has continued to rise sharply, and the difference between the market price and the negotiated price has become increasingly apparent. The result of state-owned yarn factories selling yarn is only to allow middlemen to sit back and reap the profits. It is no longer possible for private yarn factories to continue to sell yarn at negotiated prices, so yarn sales have fallen into a state of stagnation. Yarn merchants, on the other hand, feel that they cannot maintain their business because they rely only on the small amount of yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company. The yarn market, due to the excessive difference between the market price and the negotiated price, has made it impossible for legitimate transactions to continue and has also come to a standstill. The production and sale of cotton yarn have both fallen into a state of paralysis. Therefore, the relevant authorities believe that the decisive implementation of emergency measures is imperative.</p>
<p>Control Measures Take All Aspects into Account</p>
<p>In terms of fundamental solutions, the comprehensive production and sales plan proposed by private yarn factories is also under active consideration. In the past, the policy of controlling cotton yarn often failed due to one-sided control. For example, neglecting flowers while taking care of yarn, the result of soaring flower prices was that the original agreed yarn price became out of sync, unable to make flexible adjustments, resulting in stagnation of reproduction. The new control measures in the plan will comprehensively manage everything from flowers to yarn, as well as the planning and adjustment of funds. From the initial stage of obtaining raw materials to the final stage of selling finished products, each stage will be linked together to ensure mutual coordination and response. It is reported that state-owned and private yarn factories have reached a consensus on the pace of this new control plan. Once the specific plan is finalized, it will be submitted to the relevant authorities for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>Enrich the Textile Management Committee</p>
<p>In addition, the Textile Management Committee, the agency that controls cotton yarn, is also brewing enrichment. The original number of 11 committee members is about to be expanded, with rumors of adding four committee members from private yarn factories. A textile industry tycoon told reporters: The enrichment of the Textile Management Committee is also a major test of the success or failure of democracy. If the new control plan proposed by private yarn factories can be implemented, the enforcement of the law must be strict, and after implementation, everyone should strictly abide by the law. Then, the production and sales problems of cotton yarn can be easily solved in a reasonable way.</p>
<p>Yarn Numbers Must Have Licenses to Receive Yarn</p>
<p>The China Textile Corporation has very strict restrictions on yarn allocation. In addition to stipulating various measures, cotton yarn stores, cotton weaving factories, and yarn factories must have business registration licenses from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Industry and Commerce Bureau. Therefore, in the past week, factories and stores that have not registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau have been applying to the Social Affairs Bureau for business registration in order to obtain yarn allocation from the China Textile Corporation. It is reported that a large number of applicants have gone to the Bureau, and the Industry and Commerce Section of the Social Affairs Bureau is now stepping up its review work to simplify the process and issue licenses as soon as possible to facilitate the development of industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Silk Cooperative Factory Can Start Work After Receiving Electricity</h3>
<p>The needle and thread cooperative factory and the clothing cooperative factory established with the guidance of the Social Affairs Bureau are currently developing smoothly. The Bureau, considering its financial constraints, applied to the Central Treasury for a loan of 60 million yuan on behalf of the factory, promising to guarantee it, which has been approved by the Treasury. However, the clothing cooperative factory was founded by unemployed workers from the Clothing Factory of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, who are only good at making military uniforms. When the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs reduced the workload slightly, they could not maintain it, and the factory, like a flash in the pan, was liquidated at the end of last month. As for the silk cooperative factory jointly guided by the Social Affairs Bureau, the Zhongcan Company of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the three agencies, the house repair has now been completed and is waiting to receive electricity to start work.</p>
<h3>Four Thousand Boxes of Japanese Silk Arrive in Shanghai; Resale to Resume This Week</h3>
<p>A batch of 4,000 boxes of rayon obtained by the China Trust Bureau through barter trade with Japan arrived in Shanghai the other day. The Bureau's resale association is preparing to resume allocation to the silk weaving industry starting this week. The allocation amount will be decided at a meeting this morning. According to the person in charge of the association, the 4,000 boxes of rayon can last at least two months, with the Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company needing about 800 boxes per month and other factories needing about 1,000 boxes.</p>
<h3>Points to Note for Business Firms Adjusting Capital; Ministry of Finance Orders Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau to Comply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance: Upon investigation, the registered year of the capital amount of Category 1 Item A income and special excessive profit tax, as referred to in Paragraph 2 of Article 13 of the Income Tax Law, refers to the year in which the company's establishment registration was approved. If a change of registration has been made, it refers to the year in which the last change of registration was approved. In order to adapt to actual needs and facilitate calculation, the following points to note are specifically stipulated:</p>
<p>(1) If a company has increased its capital once or several times, its originally registered capital and the capital invested in each increase shall be adjusted separately. That is, the price index of the year of establishment registration or capital increase registration and the price index of the second year before the tax year shall be calculated separately according to the prescribed formula, and the adjusted amounts shall be combined to calculate the total capital amount.</p>
<p>(2) If a company's capital increase is based on the re-evaluated value of assets and no actual capital has been invested; or although a portion of new shares has been invested, and at the same time the original capital is re-subscribed to increase capital, the entire capital amount shall be adjusted according to law using the price index of the year of the last capital increase registration and the price index of the second year before the tax year.</p>
<p>(3) For companies established separately after the merger and surviving companies, their capital amounts shall be adjusted according to law using the price index of the year of establishment registration or change of registration after the merger and the price index of the second year before the tax year.</p>
<p>(4) If a company reduces its capital and has made one or several capital increase registrations before the capital reduction registration, the deduction of the capital reduction amount shall be based on the principle of deducting later increases first. If the capital increase amount before the capital reduction is not enough to deduct the entire capital reduction amount, then it shall be deducted in reverse order until the entire capital reduction amount is deducted, and then the remaining amount and the price index of each year shall be adjusted according to law using the price index of the second year before the tax year.</p>
<p>(5) The above four items shall also apply to residents and businesses that are not corporate organizations but should be subject to special excessive profit tax.</p>
<p>(6) For companies in the recovered areas, in addition to their capital registered in accordance with the law before the occupation, their original legal tender amount shall be adjusted according to law according to the price index of the original registered year and the price index of the second year before the tax year. The increased capital amount for which the change of registration has been processed in accordance with the Regulations on the Handling of Various Company Registrations in the Recovered Areas, or the capital amount for which the establishment registration has been processed, shall be adjusted using the price index of this change of registration or the year of establishment registration and the price index of the second year before the tax year.</p>
<p>(7) For non-corporate organizations in the recovered areas that should be subject to special excessive profit tax, in addition to their capital legally registered with the local competent commercial authority before the occupation, their original legal tender amount shall be adjusted according to law according to the price index of the original registered year and the price index of the second year before the tax year. The capital invested during the occupation period shall be adjusted according to the price index of the year registered with the local competent commercial authority after the recovery and the price index of the second year before the tax year.</p>
<h3>Qian Zhuang Industry to Form a National Federation</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Banking Businesses was officially established in the capital the other day. It is learned that the Qian Zhuang industry has also begun to launch the National Qian Zhuang Business Federation. The Shanghai Qianye Guild has introduced Tai Runqing and others to engage in preparations, and will jointly prepare with the Qian Zhuang industry in major cities in order to quickly establish a collective organization of the National Qian Zhuang industry for the development of the industry.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Southern Goods Industry Guild Petition to the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus Because the Seafood and Other Three Industries Refuse to Sell Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Seafood, Northern Goods, and Longan industry organized the "Three Industry Guilds Joint Regulation Office" to boycott the purchase of the Southern Goods industry. After the Southern Goods Industry Guild provided evidence of invoices for the soaring prices of the former three industries, the Municipal Police Bureau has sentenced the persons in charge of the firms that privately raised prices to detention for seven days, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the revocation of the illegal organization "Three Industry Guilds Joint Regulation Office" and banned boycotts to maintain social order. However, although the dispute was once mediated and an agreement was about to be reached, the former three industries suddenly unanimously refused to sell goods to the Southern Goods industry starting the day before yesterday, causing the dispute to escalate. Therefore, all directors, supervisors, and member representatives of the Southern Goods industry petitioned to the Municipal Police Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the goods in Southern Goods stores are also daily necessities for the public. If they are considered non-essential goods and allowed to increase prices without standards, it will also have a major impact on people's livelihood. Now, the three industries dare to intensify their efforts, closing their doors and refusing to sell goods, attempting to make huge profits. They should request the competent leaders to provide relief, etc. At that time, the Chief of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau, Fang, and the Section Chief of the Economic Section, Chen, received them, and stated that if there are violations of the law by privately raising prices, the Bureau will enforce the law. Those who have already been penalized will also be enforced according to law, etc. Later, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu, personally received them, and instructed that the former illegal organization had been ordered to be revoked and banned from boycotting sales. He would investigate further and revoke the business licenses of five firms that were found to have evidence, etc. The petition group dispersed satisfied.</p>
<h3>January Import and Export Statistics Show a Decrease Compared to the End of Last Year</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the customs statistics released the other day: The net value of China's imported goods in January of this year was 150,625,438,000 yuan. The net value of exported goods was 48,475,339,000 yuan. The import surplus in January was 102,150,099,000 yuan. Exports are about three times the imports. Compared with December of last year, the net value of imports and exports in January of this year both decreased. Imports decreased by 5,981,425,000 yuan, and exports decreased by 25,678,426,000 yuan. It can be seen from the above that the decrease in export value is particularly severe.</p>
<p>Among the values of various imported goods, the first place is oils, waxes, etc., totaling 22,632,528,000 yuan. The second place is paper and paper products, totaling 13,525,197,000 yuan. The third place is metals and ores, totaling 13,464,418,000 yuan. The fourth place is tobacco, totaling 12,846,158,000 yuan. The fifth place is wool and its products, totaling 11,172,464,000 yuan. The sixth place is chemical products and pharmaceuticals, totaling 8,882,700,000 yuan. Raw cotton, which used to occupy the first place in import value every month last year, has fallen to the seventh place, totaling 7,867,979,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Among the values of various exported goods, the first place is oils and waxes, totaling 11,854,608,000 yuan. The second place is animals and animal products, totaling 10,096,909,000 yuan. The third place is ores, metals, etc., totaling 5,044,588,000 yuan. The fourth place is textile fibers, totaling 2,555,642,000 yuan. The fifth place is piece goods, totaling 2,541,901,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Denomination Bills Facilitate Use</h3>
<p>A responsible person from the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Guild said: Recently, there have been widespread rumors of issuing large denomination bills, which has caused fluctuations in the market. In fact, during the agricultural product market season, a large amount of cash is needed to repay debts. Currently, water transportation is large everywhere, and transportation is difficult, and small denomination banknotes are inconvenient to carry. If large denomination bills are used instead, transportation can be facilitated, turnover can be accelerated, and the quantity of purchases can be increased, while reducing costs, which is beneficial to agriculture, industry, and commerce. Now, people in the market are suspicious, stimulating stocks and prices to rise. Their observations are not without error, and their psychology should be corrected so that the market can be stabilized and the national economy and people's livelihood can benefit.</p>
<h3>The Coal and Oil Industry Guild Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal and Oil Industry Commercial Guild was previously approved by the Social Affairs Bureau to resume its establishment and began preparations in January of this year. On the one hand, oil companies and manager stores were solicited to participate, and everything was already in order. The Guild specially convened its inaugural meeting yesterday (the 20th) at 2:00 p.m. More than 30 oil merchant member representatives, including Guanghua Yuxin, attended, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended as observers. Chairman Ke reported on the Guild's preparations, followed by speeches from various representatives attending as observers. The charter was then passed, and directors and supervisors were elected, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Hongji and Keelung Coal Supplies are Increasing</h3>
<p>The supply of Vietnam's Hongji coal mine has been gradually increasing recently. The production of Taiwan's Keelung coal mine has gradually recovered, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has increased the number of ships for transportation. The supply of Kai Luan coal can also be increased, so the future of the entire fuel problem is quite optimistic.</p>
<h3>There is No Problem with Flour Supply; The Allocation Price Will Not Be Changed for the Time Being; The Government Stores 1 Million Bags of Flour for Emergency Use</h3>
<p>Recently, food prices have generally risen, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. Only flour, because of the regular allocation maintained by the Fuxin and other five major flour mills, has little impact on various kinds of pasta on the market. According to the allocation负责人 of the five major flour mills, the allocated price of flour is still maintained at the negotiated price of 47,700 yuan per bag, and there has been no change. This price can definitely be maintained in the near future, and the allocation of flour will not be interrupted. Since each flour mill has obtained a government loan of 6 billion yuan, it has been able to purchase 130,000 dan of wheat every month, so there is definitely no problem with the supply of more than 10,000 bags of flour per day to the city. Moreover, this year's wheat production is about to mature. Even if each factory does not receive foreign wheat supplies, there will be no shortage of raw materials.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the government stores more than 1 million bags of foreign flour in Shanghai, so that if each flour mill fails to meet the needs of flour allocation, the Ministry of Food will allocate a portion for supply.</p>
<h3>Transportation Business Company Representatives Go to the Capital to Petition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Transportation Business Guild, due to the railway freight business office hindering the business of transportation merchants, once convened a general membership meeting to discuss countermeasures. It is now learned that the guild, based on the resolution of the general meeting, yesterday submitted appeals to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and other agencies. It also appointed representatives Li Mulian, Liu Chunlin, and others to go to the capital to petition. It is reported that representatives Pang Jufu and Mai Leshan from the Hangzhou Transportation Business Guild also arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will jointly proceed to the capital.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Alkali Manufacturing Company Can Supply Caustic Soda and Hydrochloric Acid</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to an investigation by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: The demand for caustic soda in Shanghai is mainly from the dyeing and weaving, condiment, fertilizer, dye, paper making, and cosmetics industries. The highest annual demand is 123,850 barrels (300 kilograms per barrel). The current demand is 59,800 barrels.</p>
<p>The demand for hydrochloric acid is mainly from the condiment and dyeing and weaving industries. The highest annual demand is 300,000 boxes, and the current demand is 140,000 boxes. To solve the panic regarding these industrial raw materials, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has been contacting various parties for supply. Now, a person in charge of the Taiwan Alkali Manufacturing Company stated that Taiwan's caustic soda (available in 95% and 98% grades) can supply 100 tons per month. Hydrochloric acid (20 degrees) can supply 200 tons per month. The price of caustic soda is 20% lower than the market price.</p>
<p>For the above hydrochloric acid, the price for delivery in Taiwan is NT$1,300 per box (54 kilograms), including packaging and transportation costs. To assist private factories, the company has specifically entrusted the Industry and Commerce Office to distribute the products on its behalf, so that direct users can benefit and avoid hoarding and speculation by speculators. The office has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today to discuss distribution matters with the heads of various industrial associations.</p>
<h3>Celluloid Industry in Shanghai Faces Difficulties Due to Lack of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to an investigation by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the general situation of the celluloid industry in Shanghai is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) General Situation: There are a total of 63 members in the Shanghai Celluloid Industry Guild. The Great China Celluloid Factory, which could produce celluloid raw materials, has been shut down for a long time and therefore has not joined the guild. The Mei Hua Celluloid Manufacturing Factory, the Beautiful Mai Celluloid Factory, and the Guoguang Artificial Ivory Factory can also produce raw materials, but they only remelt old films. Mei Hua's highest monthly output is 20,000 pounds of celluloid sheets and 15,000 dozen fountain pen barrels, but the current actual output is only half of that. Beautiful's highest monthly output is 8,000 to 12,000 pounds of celluloid billiard ball material. Guoguang also manufactures finished products, so its raw material output is lower. Other celluloid factories only process domestically and foreign-made celluloid sheets.</p>
<p>Before the war, celluloid raw materials mostly relied on supply from Japan. Now, because the source of Japanese goods has been cut off, they can only use old films as a substitute.</p>
<p>(2) Products: The output of celluloid products, such as fountain pen barrels, toys, soap boxes, and buttons, is difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>(3) Raw Materials: Celluloid raw materials cannot be produced domestically from scratch. The following raw materials, except for nitrocellulose (or waste film) and _, can all be manufactured in China:</p>
<p>Raw Material Name: A. Nitrocellulose (or waste film) - Highest annual demand: 980,000 pounds (40 tons), B. Alcohol - 300,000 pounds, C. Amyl alcohol - 120,000 pounds, D. Iodine - 258,000 pounds, E. Zinc _ powder - 14,000 pounds (9 tons), F. _ Camphor - 384,000 pounds, G. Celluloid transparent sheets - 84,000 pounds, H. Standard ping-pong raw materials - 60,000 pounds, I. Various colored _ Celluloid sheets - 480,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Current annual demand: A. 150,000 pounds (70 tons), B. 45,000 pounds, C. 18,000 pounds, D. 38,700 pounds, E. 3,000 pounds (1.5 tons), F. 50,000 pounds, G. 12,600 pounds, H. 9,000 pounds, I. 270,000 pounds.</p>
<p>(4) Current Difficulties: 1. None of the celluloid factories in Shanghai are currently manufacturing nitrocellulose. However, to solve the problem of raw materials for the celluloid industry, a supply of nitric acid and sulfuric acid is necessary. 2. Members of the industry once bid for machinery for manufacturing celluloid raw materials from the Enemy Property Administration Bureau, which could produce 200 pounds per day, but it has not started operating in the six or seven months since due to the lack of electricity. 3. The industry hopes that foreign celluloid raw materials can continue to be imported with restrictions.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Construction Begins</h3>
<p>— Taipei, 9th (Air Mail) - Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>The Japanese occupied Taiwan for half a century, but construction only began in the last fifteen years. This process encountered setbacks at the end of the war, preventing its continued high development. Now, this presents us with a major test.</p>
<p>Taiwan is designated as a "Year of Production" this year. In conjunction with production, construction expenses account for 20% of the total budget of 4 billion. The authorities are clearly determined to complete the construction of a model province with facts. Construction can enhance the provincial people's understanding of the motherland.</p>
<p>However, just as construction was beginning, it encountered the February 28th Incident, a new typhoon in the construction project. It greatly discounted the enthusiasm of those who devoted themselves to work, and the source of work is currently drying up. This is a phenomenon of receding tide. Clarifying the current situation is a prerequisite for launching construction projects.</p>
<p>Cement Pavement Project</p>
<p>Total Budget of 9 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>The central task of construction on the island this year is the construction of the Zhudong Railway. The second is the construction of cement pavement on the island's trunk lines. The reporter will specifically introduce the cement pavement construction project.</p>
<p>Wu Wenxi, general manager of the engineering company who led the reporter to conduct on-site surveys between Xinzhuang and Taoyuan in the suburbs of Taipei, told me: Don't underestimate this highway "processing" project. Among the 390+ kilometers of the island's provincial highway, the cement and asphalt roads built by the Japanese are only 99 kilometers. There are still nearly 300 kilometers, and it is planned to complete it within seven years at a rate of 60 kilometers per year, with a total budget of 9 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Last November, General Manager Wu and Fei Hua, Director of the Public Works Bureau, started the construction of this major project in Xinzhuang. The original plan was to complete the section passing through 15 kilometers to Taoyuan, with a project cost of NT$33 million, but price increases forced it to increase to more than 42 million. It was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of March, but the February 28th Incident unexpectedly delayed the time to the end of May!</p>
<p>Xinzhuang to Taoyuan Section</p>
<p>Requires 3,500 Tons of Cement</p>
<p>When the reporters arrived in the small town of Xinzhuang, the highway was flying with gray sand. This area and Hsinchu are adjacent and are "windy" areas. General Manager Wu was worried about the fine sand piled up on the side of the highway, as it could not withstand the wind. This trip, he focused on observing the reconstruction of the roadbed after the torrential rain the night before. The most feared thing after the completion of the cement surface paving was heavy rain the next day, as it could not withstand the devastation of heavy rain during this period. But after a day, and after four weeks of drying in the shade, under the protection of water and sand, the clean, flat, and non-cracking road surface was revealed.</p>
<p>In this section, the Japanese had already paved half of it in the past. This time, only 13.9 kilometers are paved, with an average thickness of 15 centimeters. Both the upper and lower layers are made of concrete. The road surface is 6 meters wide, divided into full-width and two-thirds-width paving. The total length of the line is 83,400M2, which is equivalent to 12,510m3. As of April 5, 48,400M2 had been completed, and 35,000M2 remain to be completed. The materials needed are 3,500 tons of cement and 135 tons of steel bars, which are supplied by the Public Works Bureau. The rest are stones and laying sand, and fine sand have to be transported from more distant areas.</p>
<p>Cooperation Between Male and Female Workers</p>
<p>New Road Surface Guaranteed for 30 Years</p>
<p>At most, there were 7 mixing machines working within the 15 kilometers, but now only 4 continue to operate due to the difficulty in supplying cement. First, we carefully watched the workers work at Shiba Fen, 16 kilometers from Xinzhuang, at 17 kilometers, and in Guishan. Here, the spirit of cooperation between male and female workers is fully demonstrated.</p>
<p>Skilled technicians level the roadbed on the old stone road and erect wooden signs prohibiting military vehicles from passing. At the same time, wooden molds are installed with iron nails. Within the boundary of this wooden mold, pebbles of 2.5 to 10.5 inches are laid flat, which requires the use of 8-ton, 10-ton, and 12-ton road rollers. After that, the concrete coming out of the mixing machine (there are more than 100-foot mixing machines in the province, but this project uses small, movable machines) is laid on top manually. The steel bars are laid flat at all four corners using hand rollers or wooden rammers, and then cement is added like a barber applying oil. Finally, the wooden boards are used to level it, which is a process from rough lines to fine lines.</p>
<p>After the road surface is paved, it needs to be paved with 50cm-wide and 15cm-thick gravel road. A cement road surface can last for 30 years, but its greatest fear is water accumulation, as water is the enemy of all road surfaces.</p>
<p>Young Female Workers</p>
<p>Earn 100 Yuan in Daily Wages</p>
<p>At most, there were 1,200 workers, but now there are only more than 400 workers working on the road surface construction. Among them, about half are female workers. These female workers come from all over, and most of them are very young. They wear hats with powder and rouge, gloves on their hands, and wrap their legs with various scarlet fabrics under their bare feet. This is almost a miracle. They have a very aesthetic sense and are afraid that the ultraviolet rays of the subtropics will damage the beauty of their skin!</p>
<p>They carry stones and push cement carts skillfully on light railways, and use wooden boards to smooth the cement road surface. In their work, they have been taught to keep pace and work in batches habitually. In reality, this section requires 4170 male workers and 87570 female workers. Now 40,500 workers have been paid, and 46,500 more workers are needed. Assuming male workers are used, it can be halved. The efficiency of female workers is exactly half that of male workers.</p>
<p>Crowded in the ranks of workers, they retain a strong smell of cosmetics. They can earn 100 yuan per day, and the foreman can get an extra one-tenth, but the payment of wages does not go through this middleman. The construction business is also providing relief to the unemployed!</p>
<p>Using cement produced in Taiwan to build cement pavement clearly shows that Taiwan's highway construction is superior to that of any other province. Although such road surfaces are not ideal, they cannot be covered with asphalt, nor can they be mixed with brown color. But compared to military-style highways, it has undoubtedly embarked on advanced industrialized construction. There is a north-south railway line in the western part of the island, and there is also a highway parallel to it, which has special significance in transportation and national defense. Currently, adding cement construction to the stone highway will definitely greatly benefit the consumption of transportation, gasoline, and tires, and it is even more valuable than economy in education and transportation. It helps to improve the culture and living standards of the Taiwanese people who are happy!</p>
<p>Completing Construction Projects</p>
<p>Requires Capital and Sweat</p>
<p>Completing a construction project requires a huge amount of capital and the sweat of the workers. Zhuang Huai, the former director of the Public Works Office who was in charge of the project, resigned. Now Director Fei has appointed Chief Engineer Li Chunsong to concurrently manage the project. What he cares about most is the accumulation of water beside the cement road, while Manager Wu carefully corrects and supervises every step. The planned Public Works Bureau and the actual working engineering company are interdependent.</p>
<p>Director Fei used to work on the Sichuan-Shanxi Highway, and Manager Wu's most sophisticated masterpiece was the construction of the Le-Xi Highway (Leshan to Xichang), which cost 111 million yuan in 1940 and was completed within a time limit. This time, with the two of them processing and constructing the round-the-island highway, people should be full of optimism. But it is hoped that Taiwan can restore its previous situation, maintain the ambition of the workers, and even more hope that a stable political situation can guarantee the smooth completion of the high-grade road surface!</p>
<p>This work is arduous and great, and it provides facts for building a model province.</p>

<h3>International Spy: Eisler</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>The well-known Comintern spy, Eisler, is a short, stocky Austro-Hungarian hybrid who looks like an old bookseller or a second-rate insurance salesman. With his half-bald head, glasses perched on his nose, and owl-like, unremarkable features, no one would believe he was the leader of the American Communist Party. When he was being interrogated in the House office building, he glared at the members of the Un-American Activities Committee who were questioning him and roared, "I am not a spy, not a foreign agent, and certainly not the leader of the Communist Party... I do not wish to swear under oath without prior warning."</p>
<p>However, other witnesses unanimously denounced him as a Comintern spy. His sister, Fischer, called him a "complete terrorist." They testified that he was connected to spies who leaked Canadian atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, others testified that he had worked alone as a spy. Based on all this evidence, the Un-American Activities Committee formally filed a lawsuit against him on charges of conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government, contempt of Congress, perjury, tax evasion, and passport forgery.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Eisler, the Comintern spy? What is his impact on American life? This is something not only Americans want to know, but perhaps people of other countries would also like to know.</p>
<p>A Moment of Glory</p>
<p>Eisler's father was a smart, hard-working scholar, but his earnings were not enough to support his family. His wife was a German woman he met while studying in Leipzig. He worked as a professor at the University of Vienna but ruined his career because he hated religion. He devoted himself to writing philosophical books, working 15 to 18 hours a day. Although he gained a good reputation, his income was meager and his livelihood precarious. His wife sometimes, for lack of money for supper, would secretly take some books from his bookshelf and give them to her daughter to sell. The hardship of their life can be imagined.</p>
<p>Eisler was the second son. He had an older brother and an older sister. The three of them were deeply resentful and frustrated by their father's failure in life, which drove them to embrace socialism. The eldest brother, Hans, is now a famous Hollywood composer, enjoying himself with music. Eisler and Fischer were avid readers and debaters. Fischer recalled that her brother in his youth was "bookish, fond of sports, cheerful, moody, arrogant, stubborn, and easily angered." Another Viennese said he had a sharp, satirical wit. When the Austrian princess made a statement during World War I, saying, "Since Viennese people peel sweet potatoes before eating them, I don't believe they will experience famine," Eisler retorted, "Since Your Majesty does not eat roasted goose with feathers, we certainly won't eat sweet potatoes with their skins."</p>
<p>During World War I, Eisler served on the Italian front, earning five medals and rising to the rank of lieutenant. At the end of the war, he quickly returned to Vienna and joined the Austrian Communist Party, working in organization, speech-making, and writing pamphlets. That was in 1918, when he was only 21 years old.</p>
<p>However, communism did not flourish in Austria. Eisler and his sister both grew up in Leipzig and, besides harboring ambition, also admired Germany. At that time, Austrian workers were joining the German Communist Party in droves, but intellectual leaders were scarce and in high demand. Fischer went to Berlin in 1919, and Eisler followed two years later. After they arrived in Germany, the Communist Party's policies became tortuous and internal strife erupted.</p>
<p>The German Communist Party split into left and right wings. Fischer was always considered smarter than her brother, and she was also sexually attractive. She quickly rose to become a leader of the left wing, becoming one of the prominent leaders of the German Communist Party at that time.</p>
<p>Concealing Identity</p>
<p>Eisler's intelligence matured more slowly than his sister's. He joined the right wing and became a confidant of the right-wing leader, Brandler. Soon he formed a centrist faction and appointed himself leader, aiming to reconcile the left and right wings. However, the party's center of gravity shifted to the right. Fischer and the left-wing members firmly opposed this trend. Lenin had strongly supported her. But in 1926, Stalin had her expelled and replaced her with Thälmann as the sole leader of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Eisler continued to work diligently, giving eloquent speeches and writing, still ambitiously striving upward. In 1928, he saw an opportunity. Thälmann's brother-in-law was exposed in Hamburg for embezzling party funds. Eisler took the lead in attacking Thälmann, accusing him of accepting bribes and concealing the loot. He succeeded, and Thälmann was removed from his position as party leader.</p>
<p>In 1929, he went to China as a journalist, then soon returned home, retaining his original position until 1933. From then until 1939, when he was confined in Le Vernet, he organized underground work against Nazis in France, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia. After that, he went to Mexico via the United States, where he wrote and contributed to magazines. He insisted that he was neither a member of the Comintern nor a spy of any kind.</p>
<p>Everyone who knew Eisler testified that this statement was a lie. Those familiar with the inner workings of the Communist Party were not surprised. A Communist Party member must sacrifice everything for the party. He must blindly obey the orders of the party leaders, especially those Communist Party members who rely on them for their livelihood. They must be prepared to carry out orders to steal, kill, betray friends, and even betray their own country.</p>
<p>After Eisler entered this dark world, he became a fully fledged Comintern spy. He was doubly enthusiastic, doubly cautious, and doubly suspicious of his enemies and friends, for two reasons: first, because he had opposed his comrade Thälmann, and second, because he was the brother of Fischer, who had been denounced by the Soviet Union as a Trotskyist. Although Eisler had repeatedly threatened to kill her, she was still his sister. In the era of terror, Eisler's face would turn pale when her name was mentioned.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Eisler tried to conceal his identity and his party affiliation. However, because he had been a professional revolutionary for a long time, he naturally had many old friends, old comrades, and estranged relatives who liked to talk about his deeds. At the same time, the police in various countries paid special attention to Eisler's activities.</p>
<p>Eisler did indeed go to China in 1929, but not as a journalist. At that time, President Chiang was implementing the purge. As a Comintern spy, Eisler was responsible for eliminating spies and dissidents within the party. In order to show Moscow his enthusiasm and loyalty, Eisler killed dozens of soldiers and civilians. When this news reached Germany, people gave him the nickname "Executioner."</p>
<p>Activities in America</p>
<p>Eisler set out for the United States from Paris in 1933, carrying an Austrian passport. His credentials and rank had been sent to New York in advance using code. Based on his success in China, Eisler expected to achieve even greater things in America.</p>
<p>Although Eisler had no particular relationship with President Roosevelt, he was very successful among Roosevelt's many staff members. The United States' recognition of the Soviet Union in 1933 changed the attitude of American liberals toward the American Communist Party, and at least outwardly changed the attitude of the American Communist Party toward liberals. The era of the Popular Front had arrived. Jefferson and Lincoln, along with Marx and Lenin, became heroes of the American Communist Party. All of this was beneficial to Eisler.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's usual tactic is to unite the petty bourgeoisie against a common enemy. Once that enemy is defeated, they then deal with the temporary allies. Eisler led his party members to engage in the following tasks: (1) infiltrating labor unions and other legitimate free organizations; (2) organizing Popular Front groups. They have had considerable success, at least controlling six unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and holding power in many other unions.</p>
<p>Eisler often traveled around under assumed names, engaging in investigation, speech-making, and organizing. In situations where he could not reveal his Communist Party identity, he won people's sympathy under the guise of a German exile. He thereby gained insight into American social life, the strengths and weaknesses of political parties, black and labor issues, and how to influence non-Communist individuals and groups.</p>
<p>Recently, when asked if he had ever faced any danger as the leader of the Communist Party, he shrugged and replied, "I have participated in street fights, been beaten up, led strikes, and led demonstrating crowds, but that's not considered any great danger. It's just part of the daily life of millions of Communists."</p>
<p>If a professional Communist Party member is indifferent to personal danger, then he is equally indifferent to friends, family, and country. He is not a patriot. He has a deep love for Germany, but he has never fulfilled the duties of a citizen. Like every Communist Party member, his first loyalty is to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Eisler first married the actress Dührn in Vienna in 1920. They lived together for two years and divorced in 1926. She has remarried and lives in New York. In 1931, Eisler married his sister-in-law, Ella, in Vienna. Recently, a reporter from "Life" magazine found her impoverished and ill in Stockholm. According to her, she is still Eisler's wife, and since 1938, he has abandoned her and her daughter. The first request Ella made to the reporter was for Eisler's current address. She said, "He is one of the leading figures of the Comintern. He uses his organization to avoid me and let my daughter and I starve. He uses communism as a talisman and can always find an excuse. He is an extremely clever, witty, and interesting person, but he is isolated from society and reality."</p>
<p>He is now living with a beautiful young woman named Brunhilda, but they are not married. They both left France for the United States in 1941. The American and Mexican authorities in Marseille jointly issued a travel permit. So they knew about this.</p>
<p>Eisler is undoubtedly the Comintern's representative in the United States. But he is more carefully concealing his identity and mission than before. He lives in a simple apartment. His public activities are limited to the "Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee," and he is sure to go to the meeting office almost every morning at nine o'clock.</p>
<p>He has never been to the Communist Party headquarters, but he issues orders to party leaders anytime, anywhere, sometimes using unsigned notes, sometimes in parks, sometimes in restaurants. Most party members are unaware of this.</p>
<p>During the war, the American Communist Party adopted a policy of class truce. After the war ended, Moscow ordered the resumption of class struggle. Eisler was ordered to implement the new policy, which had three main objectives: (1) to incite Americans to distrust British and American foreign policy and to defend the Soviet Union's expansionist policy; (2) to weaken the possibility of the United States waging war against the Soviet Union; (3) to eliminate the American capitalist system. Eisler often wrote articles under the pseudonym Hans Berger in the "Daily Worker" attacking American foreign policy.</p>
<p>Recently, Eisler shifted his focus to American artists, writers, and intellectuals, getting them to support the Communist Party's policies. His brother, Hans, who composed the music for the "Comintern" anthem and other Marxist propaganda music, is now a popular composer in Hollywood, helping his brother to win over a group of literary and artistic figures.</p>
<p>Eisler seems to have given up hope that the class consciousness of American workers will develop enough to cause a Russian-style revolution. His hope now lies in the farmers and the middle class. Regardless of Eisler's fate, Americans believe that other Eislers and their followers will continue to vigorously promote their established policies through strikes, demonstrations, and propaganda.</p>
<h3>The Determination Underneath the Strata: Guangxi's Industrial and Mining Undertakings Re-emerge with New Sprouts</h3>
<p>— By Liang Xiaozhong, Our Correspondent in Guilin, November 11th (Airmail)</p>
<p>The barrenness on the surface often cannot conceal the treasure trove of wealth underground. The entire terrain of Guangxi can be said to encompass mountains from any historical period. Buried within these myriad deep ravines are countless precious resources—an inexhaustible number of mineral deposits. As long as they can be properly managed, transitioning from poverty to abundance is as easy as bending a finger. Those who possess a fortune of gold at home but are unaware of it and beg for help are understandable. However, those who own millions in assets but do not know how to utilize them are nearing pessimism. Nevertheless, people throughout Guangxi know how to drive the old ox cart onto a better path. Here, let the reporter tell you a little about the "mineral status" underneath Guangxi's strata, and a rough sketch of "how people are turning into mutual benefactors":</p>
<p>Tin, Tungsten, Antimony, Lead: Focus on Increasing Production</p>
<p>Guangxi's mineral products are most famous for tin, tungsten, antimony, and lead, among which tin and tungsten are particularly favored by nature. Before and after the war, they were consistently in high demand on the international market. Even during the war, many unscrupulous merchants took great risks to smuggle them to Hong Kong and Guangdong for sale, and the enemy used these raw materials to make weapons to slaughter our compatriots. These four types of mineral deposits are mainly concentrated and abundant in Fuchuan and He County in eastern Guangxi, as well as the Hechi and Nandan areas in northern Guangxi. Government and commercial operations engaged in mining also take this as their primary target. According to reliable surveys: the tin ore reserves reach 1,992,514 metric tons, tungsten ore is approximately 994,944 metric tons, antimony ore is 1,081,292 metric tons, and lead is approximately 5,200,000 metric tons. Last year, when the lost territories were initially recovered, the mines were severely damaged. The production of tin sand could still maintain an output of 8,176 metric tons. Its richness, except for Jiangxi, is probably unmatched by few other places. The sales of tungsten and tin all rely on exports to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. There are officially stipulated prices in the production areas, but once they are exported, their value increases tenfold, and merchants scramble to purchase them. However, up to now this year, the output of commercially operated mines is only between 500 and 700 tons, whereas last year it was more than 8,000 tons. The impact of soaring costs and prices has led to a sense of decline. Antimony and lead are mostly sold domestically to neighboring provinces. Antimony products have beautiful styles (Guilin is famous for making woks and other items, which are extremely popular with visitors) and sell very well. The authorities have made great efforts to maintain these special mineral products. Relief for mine owners is sometimes discovered. However, the organization with the largest scale of mining is the government-run Pinggui Mining Bureau (co-operated by the provincial government and the Resources Committee, located in Xiwang). It has the most modern power plants, large coal mines, and tin smelting plants. As of the end of March this year, it has produced 8,915 metric tons of tin and 2,153 metric tons of crude tin, and the output is increasing daily. It is currently expanding mineral exploration, which could increase production by two-fifths. The prospects for tin production are indeed optimistic.</p>
<p>Guangxi Coal Production: Second to None</p>
<p>The source of power—coal production in Guangxi can be said to be second to none in South China. The already surveyed reserves have reached a massive 110,435,900,000 metric tons, with production areas scattered throughout the province. Both traditional and modern mining methods are used everywhere. Among them, the Heshan Coal Mine and the Pinggui Mining Bureau are considered the giants. However, even these so-called giants have pitifully low output. The Pinggui Mining Bureau's annual output last year was only 14,687 metric tons, and the Heshan Coal Mine (a joint government-commercial venture located in Laibin) was only about 10,000 tons. Privately operated coal mines produce a total of 5,143 metric tons. However, this small amount of coal constrains the lifeline of the entire Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway. The Guiliu section and the Liuyi section currently in operation truly "cannot be without this gentleman for a day." When the coal production is insufficient, the locomotives even burn glory for fuel, isn't that laughable! Fortunately, vast coalfields have recently been discovered in the central Guangxi area, and it is said that their reserves are incalculable. A loan of 400 million yuan was requested from the Four Banks Joint Office for exploitation, but after much begging, only 100 million was obtained, and goods have become more expensive. What happens next remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Entire Southern Guangxi: A Gold Zone</p>
<p>Of all the mines, what makes people most enthusiastic is the gold mine. Last year, for 360 days, gold prospectors took more than 5,000 taels of yellow metal from the deep mountains. Government officials extracted more than 16,500 taels of raw gold from the Shanglin Gold Mine. What about this year? There are no definite figures this year. However, since the beginning of spring, gold diggers have been frantically heading to the mountains and ridges in a spring dream. The entire southern Guangxi land is a gold zone (Huaiji and Xindu in eastern Guangxi also produce gold). Before the war, there were more than 300 large and small mines. Some went bankrupt because of this, while others rose to prominence. Some say that mining is a gamble. Often, those with strong capital control the outcome. However, it is also a fact that the "bosses" who take a cut definitely earn countless amounts of money. Currently, it is estimated that there are still more than 40 scattered gold mines, among which there are no lack of secret mining and "forced mining." The mine tax is too much of a headache.</p>
<p>In addition, there is sulfur ore, with an annual output of more than 34,000 metric tons. There are also more than 24 million metric tons of iron ore underground waiting to be used (speaking of iron, one cannot help but think of the "trivial matter" of the common people playing with iron. In mountainous counties, countless people often take earth-cast iron and forge not-so-bad machine guns, rifles, carbines, and pistols, which are scattered among the vast bandit and traitor groups. In Wuxuan County alone, there are 40 such "arsenals," the seriousness of which can be imagined). Everything is a matter of wealth, only depending on how long people's hands are and how far-sighted the government's vision is.</p>
<p>Technical and Economic: Two Major Aids</p>
<p>As of recently, after the provincial government's efforts to supervise and guide, there are already more than 100 large mines and more than 20 small mining areas that have resumed production (there were more than 500 large mining areas and 600 small mining areas in the past). On the one hand, the authorities are requesting technical and financial assistance from the Economic and Financial Departments. At the same time, the Relief Administration is successively allocating equipment to various mining areas. Currently, more than 30 companies have received allocations. It is also heard that the Executive Yuan has ordered the Relief Administration to investigate the current situation of mining areas in Guangxi, preparing to transfer a large number of technical personnel and equipment to assist in construction. This is undoubtedly a powerful aid to Guangxi's industrial and mining undertakings that are re-emerging with new sprouts. As long as the hard-working spirit of the Guangxi people does not fade away, turning a barren land into a paradise on earth in ten or five years is not a difficult task.</p>

<p>A Humble Proposal for Improving Traffic in This City</p>
<p>Since the victory, although the authorities have repeatedly implemented rectification measures for traffic in the central district, it has not yet been resolved. According to the Public Works Bureau, this is all due to the lack of public vehicles and the large increase in pedicabs and rickshaws. However, according to the authorities' recent announcement, the number of municipal public buses has increased to 167, which is comparable to the number before the war under British merchants. Why is the traffic situation still not as good as before the war? The biggest reason for this is that the public bus routes are still not appropriate. The congestion of pedicabs and rickshaws in the central district is due to two reasons: first, it is inconvenient for residents of various districts to travel to the central district by public bus, and second, traffic in the northern and southern districts of the Suzhou Creek must pass through the central district. Therefore, the current increase in routes should be based on solving the above-mentioned traffic problems and dispersing pedicabs and rickshaws to various districts. For example, taking Route 9 as an example, its terminal is in the New World, but most passengers' destinations are the centralized industrial and commercial organizations east of Henan Road. If they have to wait for another bus or walk after getting off, it is both troublesome and time-consuming. They would rather take a rickshaw directly from their starting point to their destination. In this case, even if there are hundreds of routes, it would only cause pedicabs to stay in the central district for a long time, engaging in business within the district. It not only cannot solve congestion but also increases congestion. The Public Works Bureau's intention to prevent Routes 9 and 7 buses from entering the central district is to avoid delays and losses due to limited time, but it is unwilling to fulfill its mission of solving congestion in the central district, which is a great loss to the purpose of improving city traffic to benefit the people. Looking back at the time of the former concessions, Nanjing East Road had three public bus routes, Zhengdong East Road had five routes, and Beijing East Road had two routes, all of which penetrated deep into the central district. It was very convenient for citizens to travel to and from the central district, and few took rickshaws, so the central district did not have the current congestion, which can serve as a lesson from the past.</p>
<p>I have lived in Shanghai for fifteen years and am familiar with the traffic situation due to my work. Now, I am taking the time to make the following sincere suggestions, hoping that the authorities can adopt them.</p>
<p>(1) Existing routes that need to be reformed:</p>
<p>(A) Route 9 — From the New World, follow Nanjing East Road to the Bund, and set up a terminal next to the Huizhong and Cathay Hotels, and cancel the winding route between Xizang Road and Wusheng Road.</p>
<p>(B) Route 7 — The current terminal crosses the Waibaidu Bridge, follows Zhongshan East 1st Road, turns west onto Nanjing East Road, West Road, turns south onto Huangpi North Road, South Road, turns west onto Fuxing Middle Road, and the terminal circles around the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Baoqing Road, serving as a direct transportation station between the Old French Concession and the North District. (C) Route 4 — From the current terminal, follow Beijing East Road, turn west, then south onto Fanwangdu Road to Jing'an Temple, serving as a transportation line between the East District and the West District.</p>
<p>(2) Proposed routes:</p>
<p>(A) From Yichang Road Bridge, follow Jiangning Road, turn east onto Kangding Road, Huaian Road, turn south onto Zhongzheng North 2nd Road, turn east onto Xinzha Road, Beijing East Road to Huangpu Park.</p>
<p>(B) From Zhongshan North Road in Zhabei, follow Shixing Road, turn south onto Baoshan Road, Henan North Road over the bridge, turn east onto Beijing East Road, turn south onto Zhongshan East 1st Road, 2nd Road, Zhongshan South Road to Dongjiadu, connecting Zhabei and Nanshi.</p>
<p>(C) From Taiyang Temple Road in Zhabei, follow Datong Road, turn east onto Xinjiang Road, turn south onto Manzhou Road, turn east onto Kulun Road, turn south onto Xizang North Road, Middle Road, South Road, turn east onto Linsen East Road, Minguo Road, and then turn east onto Fangbang East Road to the 16th Pier.</p>
<p>(3) Every time municipal bus drivers reach the terminal, they must get off and rest, waiting for the time to be adjusted before starting. However, due to the different levels of traffic congestion along the way, there are often six or seven vehicles stopping at the terminal at the same time. Passengers wait for a long time without the bus starting, which is a huge waste. On the other hand, the French Concession's Route 22 bus does not have rigid time regulations, adjusts itself along the way, and departs as soon as it arrives at the terminal. Before their shift ends, drivers never get off to rest (stopping at each station is already a rest, compared to long-distance buses that run for several hours, there is really no need to rest at the terminal). The vehicles do not have problems of disconnection and congestion. Even British merchants before the war did not have this example.</p>
<p>If the above routes can be adjusted one by one, the number of pedicabs and rickshaws entering the central district can be reduced, and the congestion problem can be solved completely. (Li Zuoyuan)</p>

<h3>A Strange Encounter the Night Before Trial</h3>
<p>— By Anton Chekhov, Translated by Lin Fengzao</p>
<p>The coachman turned around and pointed his whip at a wild rabbit crossing the road, saying, "We seem to be out of luck, sir." Even without this bad omen, I knew there was little hope because I was about to go to the nearby court to be tried for bigamy. The weather was terrible. When I arrived at the station for the night, I was covered in snow, as if I had already been tortured. After a tedious journey in the dilapidated carriage, I felt cold, damp, and numb.</p>
<p>Arriving at the station, I saw the stationmaster. He was a tall man, wearing dark blue striped trousers, and looked like he hadn't had enough sleep. His head was already bald. His mustache seemed to grow out of his nostrils, so his sense of smell might not be very good—I daresay. There were so many foul smells. The stationmaster muttered, hummed through his nose, scratched his head, opened the door, and didn't say a word. He only pointed with his elbow to where I would be resting for the night. I smelled sealing wax and something very pungent, almost suffocating. On the table was a tin lamp, constantly smoking, barely illuminating the unpainted board walls.</p>
<p>I walked into the room, put my travel bag on the table, and said to the stationmaster, "Sir, there's an unpleasant smell here." The stationmaster took a long breath, shook his head, and said, "The smell is always the same." He scratched his head again and said, "You smell it because you've just come in from the frosty outdoors."</p>
<p>I dismissed the man and began to inspect my temporary lodging. The sofa I would be sleeping on was wide, like a double bed, covered with cold oilcloth. Besides the sofa, there was a large iron stove, a table (the one I mentioned above), a pair of someone else's felt boots, a satchel, and a screen that cornered off one part of the room. Someone was sleeping soundly behind the screen. I looked around and made the bed, then started to undress. Soon, my nose became accustomed to the smell. I took off my coat, trousers, and boots, then hopped around the iron stove to warm up, alternately raising and lowering my bare legs. I immediately felt warmer. Finally, all that was left to do was to unfold the sofa and go to sleep—but that's when something strange happened.</p>
<p>My gaze suddenly stopped at the corner enclosed by the screen. I saw a woman's head behind the screen, with disheveled hair, dark eyes, and a faint smile. You can imagine how surprised I was. Her dark eyelashes were fluttering, and she had dimples, as if she was smiling. I became uncomfortable. She realized I had seen her and also became uncomfortable, so she hid. I lay down on the sofa and covered myself with my coat.</p>
<p>I felt responsible for what had happened. How terrible, I thought to myself, she must have seen me hopping around—that wasn't a pretty sight. The thought of her sweet face made me involuntarily dream. Image after image filled my imagination, each one more beautiful and charming than the last. A burning pain suddenly flared up on my right cheek, as if it were a punishment for having bad thoughts. I touched my right cheek, and although I didn't find anything, I knew what the problem was.</p>
<p>At this moment, I heard the woman's voice: "What to do about these annoying bedbugs? They seem to want to devour me."</p>
<p>Then I remembered that I had a good habit of always carrying Keating's Insect Powder when traveling. This time, I hadn't forgotten to pack it in my luggage. I immediately took the tin box of powder out of my travel bag. As long as I gave this powder to the beautiful woman, we could get to know each other. But how to give it to her?</p>
<p>"How terrible!" I heard her exclaim again.</p>
<p>So I said softly, "Madam, I heard you crying out, and I know you're being bothered by bedbugs. I happen to have some Keating's Insect Powder. If you want it, I'll—"</p>
<p>"Yes, I want it."</p>
<p>"I'll bring it right away. I'll put on my coat and bring it over," I said happily.</p>
<p>"No, no, just pass it over the screen. There's no need to come over here."</p>
<p>"I'll just pass it over the screen. Don't be afraid, I'm not a drunken traveler."</p>
<p>"Who knows? You're a stranger."</p>
<p>"Alright then. It wouldn't be a problem even if I walked behind the screen. Besides, I'm a doctor," I immediately told a lie. "Doctors, police detectives, and women's hairdressers can go to private places without needing to avoid them."</p>
<p>"Are you really a doctor? Really?"</p>
<p>"Please believe me. So, will you allow me to bring the powder over?"</p>
<p>"Alright, if you're a doctor, do as you please. But why bother? I can ask my husband to come over to you." She paused for a moment and whispered loudly, "Phileas, wake up, you seal! Get up, and go outside the screen. This doctor is very kind and wants to give us bedbug powder."</p>
<p>Hearing that there was someone behind the screen named Phileas, I couldn't help but be taken aback. My heart was filled with disappointment; the hammer of a gun might feel the same disappointment when a bullet misfires. I felt ashamed, annoyed, and regretful. I was stunned; when this Phileas came out from behind the screen, he looked like a rogue to me. I almost cried for help. Phileas was a tall man, all skin and bones, about fifty years old, with a grizzled beard, thin lips pressed tightly together, and fine blue veins all over his nose and temples. He was wearing pajamas and slippers.</p>
<p>He took the insecticide powder, went back behind the screen, and said, "Thank you, thank you. You're too kind, Doctor. Are you also being bothered by bedbugs?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said. I sank back onto the sofa and covered myself with my coat. "Yes, really."</p>
<p>I heard him talking to his wife: "Sirotchka, there's a bedbug running on your nose; let me get it off."</p>
<p>"Go ahead," Sirotchka said, laughing. Then she cried, "You didn't catch it! And you call yourself a senator! Everyone is afraid of you, but you can't even catch a bedbug!"</p>
<p>"Be quiet, Sirotchka, don't forget there's a stranger here. You always say things you shouldn't."</p>
<p>"These little beasts won't let you sleep," I grumbled angrily, not knowing why.</p>
<p>The couple gradually fell asleep. I closed my eyes, determined not to think about anything, and get a good night's sleep. Half an hour passed, an hour passed, but I couldn't fall asleep.</p>
<p>Finally, my neighbors began to stir, murmuring complaints to each other.</p>
<p>Phileas complained, "It's strange, even this insecticide powder isn't working very well. There are too many bedbugs."</p>
<p>Then, he called to me, "Doctor, Sirotchka wants me to ask you, why does this bedbug smell so strange?"</p>
<p>We started talking. We talked about bedbugs, the weather, the Russian winter, medicines—though my knowledge of medicines was as incomplete as my knowledge of astronomy. We also talked about Edison.</p>
<p>Then, I heard him gently admonish his wife, "Sirotchka, you don't need to be shy. He's a doctor. Don't be embarrassed; ask him. There's nothing to be afraid of. Doctor Shevyatov couldn't do anything, but maybe this doctor can."</p>
<p>"You ask him," Sirotchka said softly.</p>
<p>Phileas then said to me, "Why does my wife's chest always hurt? You know, she always coughs and feels a heaviness in her chest, as if something is stuck there."</p>
<p>"That requires a long explanation, not something that can be covered in a few words," I said. I tried to avoid the question.</p>
<p>"What does it matter if the explanation is long? We have plenty of time; we can't sleep anyway. Good doctor, please examine her. I must tell you, Doctor Shevyatov examined her. He's a good man, but I don't quite believe what he said. No, I don't believe it; however, I feel that you wouldn't give us such an optimistic diagnosis. I ask you to examine her, and in the meantime, I'll go to the stationmaster and ask him to get the tea stove ready."</p>
<p>Phileas put on his slippers and went out. I walked behind the screen. Sirotchka was sitting on a wide sofa, surrounded by many pillows, and she was pulling at her lace collar.</p>
<p>I sat beside her, furrowing my brow, and said, "Please show me your tongue." She showed me her tongue and started to laugh. Her tongue was normal—red. I took her pulse, mumbling "Hmm," although I didn't feel her pulse at all. I can't remember what else I asked about her smiling face. I only remember that when the examination was over, I felt like a fool and didn't want to ask any more questions.</p>
<p>Phileas returned. The three of us drank tea. I wrote out a prescription, following the way doctors write prescriptions, as far as I knew. (Written carelessly.)</p>
<p>Like this 〇.05 centimeters</p>
<p>World's Glory 1 centimeter</p>
<p>Distilled water 10 cubic centimeters</p>
<p>One tablespoon every two hours</p>
<p>Mrs. Shiyeva</p>
<p>Prescribed by Dr. Chekhov</p>
<p>The next morning, as I was about to leave, I stood with my travel bag, saying goodbye to my newfound friends. I thought I would never see them again. Phileas stopped me and insisted that I accept a ten-ruble note.</p>
<p>He said, "Please accept it. I always pay for honest work. You studied, you worked. I know it. Your knowledge was earned through sweat."</p>
<p>I had no choice but to accept the money. That's how the night before my trial went.</p>
<p>The court door opened, and the bailiff told me to take the defendant's seat; I'm not prepared to describe the mood at that time. My face turned green, my head felt dizzy, and looking around, I saw thousands of eyes staring at me. I seemed to hear my own funeral bell. I looked at the solemn and important faces of the jury.</p>
<p>I saw a table covered with a red cloth, and in the prosecutor's seat, I saw someone—you know who it was—Phileas! I cannot describe my horror, nor can you imagine it. He was writing. As I looked at him, I thought of bedbugs, Sirotchka, my prescription—I not only felt a chill on my spine but also the entire Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>After Phileas finished writing, he looked up and glanced around. At first, he didn't recognize me. His eyes widened, his jaw dropped, and his head shook. He slowly stood up and gave me a cold look. For some reason, I also stood up and stared back at him.</p>
<p>"Defendant, please tell the court your name and occupation," the bailiff began to say.</p>
<p>The prosecutor drank some water and sat down. Sweat beaded on his forehead.</p>
<p>"This is a fine kettle of fish, this is awful," I thought. I knew the prosecutor wanted to take revenge on me. He repeatedly went through the written evidence, muttering to himself.</p>
<p>But I can stop writing here. This is being written during the lunch break in court. After the break, the prosecutor will speak immediately.</p>
<p>Oh, heavens, what will he say?</p>
<p>Note: Chekhov is a playwright but also a short story writer. This story, written with a few light strokes, has a unique charm. It was published in 1868, but only recently has there been an English translation. This translation is based on Anna Heifetz's translation from the Slavic language department of the New York Public Library, from the American Mercury magazine last December. Translator's note.</p>
<h3>On Poetry</h3>
<p>— Bolo</p>
<p>In "The Cycle of Spring," Tagore says, "We liberate humanity from the shackles of their desires." Hegel says, "The purpose of poetry is to place the ultimate ideal form of the conscious universe into the form of imagination." From these points, we can know that poetry is a kind of truth and reason.</p>
<h3>Corelli's Humor</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>The English poet Marie Corelli (1855-1924), whose parents were both Italian, was raised by the English poet Charles Mackay from a young age. After becoming an adult, she decided to remain unmarried for life. Her friends were very surprised, so they asked her, and she replied, "I have no need to marry! What would I need a husband for? I have three things in my house, and they all serve the purpose of a husband. One is a dog, which barks incessantly every morning; another is a parrot, which chatters and curses incessantly every afternoon; and the last is a cat, which always comes home in the middle of the night."</p>
<h3>On the Shandong Road</h3>
<p>— Xi Shan</p>
<p>Those who have read "The Heroic Sons and Daughters" should remember the singing girl whom Master An met in the inn. That was the most touching scene on the old north-south roads, but it was also accumulated by countless sad tears. Since there have been shipping lanes and railways, fewer people pass by, and the rouge and powder of beautiful women adds more infinite emotion to the feelings of ancient times. This place is the western border of the state of Qi, I am afraid that the singing of the horse is a custom.</p>
<p>However, this kind of literature is rarely seen. Only at the end of the Guangxu period did Zhang Wenhu of Nanhui have a realistic record in his diary. It is said that these prostitutes become seamstresses when they get a little older. The misery of their economic life can be imagined. Zhang's diary is called "Mengyin Lu," and it is a valuable book. In the early years of the Guangxu period, the Wang family of Qinghe carved "Xiaofang Yuzhai Yudi Congchao," which collected many travel diaries, but without this book. A brief summary is as follows:</p>
<p>"From Yinping to the north, a guest enters the shop, and the doors are filled with harp players. Their ages range from eleven or twelve to seventeen or eighteen. Without waiting for the guest's orders, they begin playing licentious music, and the guests reward them with dozens of real coins, and their cheeks are filled with smiles. When they are a little older, they make a living by mending clothes. Their faces are thin, and they apply thick makeup, and the drivers and servants regard them as a gentle village. Scholars laugh at them, but they do not know that they are the same people who used to play the harp. I wrote four verses to the tune of 'Yellow Oriole':</p>
<p>"The north-south road is long, especially in the cold winter with ice and snow. In my sorrow, I suddenly see the peach blossoms smiling, with painted eyebrows and powdered faces, embracing a pipa with half a red sleeve, strumming and plucking, slender and graceful.</p>
<p>Smiling as they enter the shop, sitting in a slanting row, the sound of the four strings, telling of love and passion, urging a few cups of village wine, drifting like clouds and flowing water, do not blame them, constantly lingering. These are all pitiful people, falling into misery.</p>
<p>Young and knowing of spring, what female work have they ever learned? Greedy for money and indifferent to customs, valuing money and knives, witches raising, Wushan that peak, sending their youth to inns and stations, so hasty, red faces are like dreams, and in the blink of an eye they are mending clothes.</p>
<p>The hotel is very boring, happy to see the carriage resting temporarily. The wine star enters the seat, and the flower star shines. Singing loudly, with great passion, the fragrance of flowers enters the wine, and the cold is swept away, drunk and dizzy, a dream on the rope bed, and tomorrow the horse's hooves are far away."</p>
<p>Wenhu was a thorough Confucian scholar who lived through the four reigns of Daoguang, Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu. He first studied with Ruan Yuan, Hu Peihuan, and Chen Huan, and was able to inherit the family traditions of the pragmatic learning of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. However, after middle age, he associated with Li Shanlan and Rong Hong in Shanghai, and thus made friends with Western scholars living abroad, such as Joseph Edkins. He originally had a thorough understanding of astronomy and mathematics, and had already gained an understanding of Western science from books. Combined with modern knowledge, he became the first person to be well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning, and used his Chinese Confucianism to understand Western learning. Zeng Guofan's advocacy of Western learning after the Tongzhi period was probably influenced by Zhang the most, in addition to Li and Rong, because only his kind of writing and learning could move Zeng's ears. I record his sending of Rong Chunfu to the United States as follows:</p>
<p>"The earth is thirty thousand miles thick, its circumference is three. From here to Batavia, the road is really half the earth, in the four directions of the world, it alone forms a continent. Although the United States is a rising power, it is comparable to England and France. They establish laws like the Khitans, selecting the worthy and consulting with the public. How worthy is George Washington, whose laws are still followed today." There is also a poem sending Li Renshu to the Tongwen Guan:</p>
<p>"Western methods are gradually becoming new, and logarithms are already called divine; Since the book of Loomis was translated, the former sages sighed and piled wood. (Note: Differential and integral calculus was written by Loomis of the United States)</p>
<p>Laws, measures, and weights are inherently connected, who from Mozi traced the remaining books? The book was carefully translated by Hu Weili, and machines are not as important as studying first. (Note: The Englishman Hu Weili wrote Seventeen Volumes on Important Studies)"</p>
<p>Zhang and Chen of Lingnan were the only remaining pragmatic scholars of the early Guangxu period, and they were able to devote themselves to astronomy, arithmetic, and music. Zhang assisted Jinshan Qian Xizuo in printing Shoushan Ge Congshu, and continued to compile Yihai Zhuchen, Xiaowan Juanlou Congshu, etc., and his contribution to collecting literature was particularly great. This was also because he was born in Jiangnan and was not disturbed by official affairs.</p>
<p>His poems and lyrics, however, are very interesting, as described above. I especially like the cleverness of his couplets, such as the one in the Maitreya Hall: "Hey, the people in here are so happy; Alas, where do the outsiders come from?" Such as the one in Tang Liuru's studio: "After death, right and wrong, blind women and villagers talk nonsense; Before their eyes, fame and noise, how much money are scholars worth?" Such as the one in the study: "Opening a book is beneficial, focusing one's mind." They are also good stories.</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>— Courbet</p>
<p>Courbet (1819-1877) was a leader in resisting traditional idealism and advocating realistic life.</p>
<p>He hoisted the banner of "Realism," expressing the beautiful things and true states that his eyes could see. Using his wonderful and skilled techniques, he expressed the objects he saw on the canvas. The European art scene in the nineteenth century was painted with a thick and deep line by him.</p>
<p>His figures, landscapes, and still lifes all have a sense of reality. Like a photograph, there is no trace of subjective and serious depiction of the "form" of objects. Even non-beautiful elements are in his description. This is what is called pure realism. (Lion)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 264</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>When Tsurumi arrived at the International Hotel, he just wanted to rest for a while, but a hotel attendant reported that someone wanted to see him. The visitor was handsome and taller than Tsurumi by half a head. Just meeting him, this elegant and calm demeanor dispelled Tsurumi's fatigue, and he felt a sudden surge of energy.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I arrived half an hour early"; the visitor spoke fluent Japanese, with a soft, rounded voice, containing ten parts of firm strength.</p>
<p>"Welcome, welcome..."—Tsurumi shook the visitor's hand warmly and did not let go, "I am Tsurumi Tama, you must be Mr. Zeng Shouyi?" Speaking the second half of the sentence, Tsurumi changed to a Beijing accent.</p>
<p>Tsurumi had already received a report from Masaiwa about Shouyi's character and the general situation of Baininzhuang. Tsurumi felt that there was no need to hide anything from Shouyi, so within ten minutes, he had already told him everything, thoroughly explaining everything to Shouyi. Shouyi also expressed his sincerity at seeing him for the first time. These two young men met each other with pure and frank sincerity.</p>
<p>During the conversation, Tsurumi, like a young lady, showed off his personal treasures, introducing Kiko, Torashiro, and several other comrades to Shouyi one by one.</p>
<p>"There is a comrade surnamed Yu in our village, who probably knows one of Mr. Yue's in your department. I heard that they were old classmates." Shouyi mentioned the general situation of reporter Yue and the department, which Masaiwa had told him—also because I exposed the secret of Miyazaki Sadao for him..."</p>
<p>"It can be seen that we should all be comrades." Tsurumi always wanted to ask Baininzhuang to join his organization.</p>
<p>"Of course, we are all comrades, there is no doubt about that."</p>
<p>"Then, if we have any requests, your comrades will certainly not refuse!"</p>
<p>"As long as it does not conflict with our company's principles—I don't think there will be any conflict—we will definitely be able to cooperate fully." Shouyi drew a very clear dividing line for the boundaries of cooperation. "I also have a small contribution: under a common big goal, we can unite various comrades' small groups to cooperate, but there does not have to be a certain superficial command..."</p>
<p>"Those who can be united must have similar interests, and there must be one or two intermediaries. Once something happens, and the power of a certain group must be applied, it can be notified by this intermediary. This is what I call 'cooperation of labor'. There are many conveniences in this: on the one hand, we can unite various comrades groups, spiritually connected, and sharing information; on the other hand, the various groups can maintain their own freedom of action, and do not need a certain group to bear all the responsibilities, etc."</p>
<p>Shouyi's "small contribution" on the one hand explained the will of Baininzhuang, and on the other hand, it was because he saw the disappointment in Tsurumi's expression, so he had to give him this explanation, and it was also to give him some comfort.</p>
<p>"...Very right; very right... I never thought of this before..." Tsurumi seemed to be suddenly enlightened.</p>
<p>"It's not that you didn't think of it, but you couldn't think of it!" Shouyi smiled.</p>
<p>"How do you say that?" Tsurumi looked at Shouyi innocently, as if he and Shouyi had grown up together since childhood.</p>
<p>Dr. Chihuei summarized the ethical thought of Schiller's last play, saying:</p>
<p>"The embodiment of fighting for freedom and fighting for brightness is revolution. Although revolution inevitably involves bloodshed, the difference is that one is self-defense, is forced, is fighting for just rights, is for the public; the other is not self-defense, is not forced, is purely desire, is selfish."</p>
<p>From this correct and powerful view, we can use it to recognize the lofty and solemn spirit of the great poet Schiller, and further study Schiller's last play, Wilhelm Tell. I can't help but have a series of thoughts.</p>
<p>Grand Historian Sima Qian said it well: "Death can be as heavy as Mount Tai, or as light as a feather; the direction of its use is different." Death is the same, but it cannot be equated, because the weight of Mount Tai cannot be equal to a feather.</p>
<p>The death of achieving benevolence and taking righteousness, and the "self-destruction" of doing many unrighteous things, are too far apart.</p>
<h3>Rambling Talks on Solitude</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>I think——</p>
<p>Many "glories" of mankind are illusions transformed from "shame," and what is artificially made into "shame" may also conceal the supreme "glory" of mankind.</p>
<p>Therefore, I oppose the arbitrary slander and insults of the common people towards those they do not understand well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I value riding the wind more than pearls and jade.</p>
<p>As for the many so-called "respectable" or "despicable" aspects of the world, I am absolutely unwilling to follow the crowd before I have gained a deep understanding.</p>
<p>Quiet contemplation is far better than superficial gossiping.</p>
<p>When Buddhist disciples practice, there is a necessary stage called "Seclusion." It means locking one's own stinking body into a narrow room, letting the body endure many disasters; the result of this ascetic practice can promote the liberation of one's own soul.</p>
<p>Without considerable cultivation, one cannot "enter seclusion." If forced against reason, then due to contradictions and even breakdowns in the mind, the practitioner will either be struck down by illness or go mad, even die. This sudden psychological change, in the words of Eliot, is the great opening of the floodgates of consciousness, where the flood engulfs everything.</p>
<p>The use of thought is like walking a road; haste makes waste. Many principles for saving the world and benefiting people are understood through step-by-step, painstaking thought.</p>
<p>Legend has it that Bodhidharma sat facing a wall for ten years. Without selfishness, without self or others; not impatient, not flustered; eliminating infinite delusions, breaking all attachments; sending oneself into the realm of "form and emptiness as one." "Compassion" is the eternal spirit of the Buddha, great compassion, medium compassion, small compassion, no compassion; compassion for heaven and pity for humanity are the most initial and ultimate spirits of all religious figures.</p>

<h3>How to Return a Visit</h3>
<p>— Li Hai</p>
<p>Foreign etiquette dictates: guests must remove their coats and hats upon entering, which some Chinese may find troublesome when first learning this custom. However, as time goes by, "trouble" gradually "progresses" into habit, and habit "elevates" to the point where it is seen as the only way to express politeness and cultivation.</p>
<p>Ordinary guests are expected to remove their coats as a sign of respect upon entering a house, then surely, warriors should even more so remove their arms when visiting someone's "residence". Otherwise, who knows whether you come with good intentions or revenge?</p>
<p>Subsequently, I don't know how it happened – may it be due to the continuous improvement of human self-defense – this kind of personal etiquette has been rejected and not used in international conventions. Powerful countries simply don't care about armed visits from others; even weak countries, though apprehensive about being invaded, have to pretend to be nonchalant, gritting their teeth and enduring the "visit." This matter seems "equal" on the surface, because they can come, and you can go, a back and forth, which is in line with the way of making friends. However...</p>
<p>Let's talk about the British cruiser HMS Bermuda and the destroyer HMS Encounter, which, with the consent of our government, will sail to Shanghai for a visit tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yes, we are not worried that these two warships will stay in China's territorial waters forever, "like returning to their hometown, never to return." Since they are a famous gentleman's country, we should not doubt that they would do petty things – such as a gunner suddenly having a nervous breakdown and firing on Shanghai; or officials bringing some private goods ashore to sell; or sailors, like that "annoying" little Attlee, spreading democratic seeds in China, causing the general public to lament: "Foreign democracy is better than Chinese!" and so on.</p>
<p>In the end, what I am worried about is how to return the visit.</p>
<p>A warrior dressed in armor, carrying a cocked bow and a drawn sword, always causes a shock when "visiting" a weak and powerless family. But do you have the power to reject him? The door of the weak is always open to the strong – open or not, it has to be opened. They walk in when it's open, they break in when it's closed. That's how the laws of nature often are. (April 17th)</p>
<h3>The Joke of the "Atomic Pen King"</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>I remember that before the War of Resistance, a writer once said that Chinese compatriots did not understand humor. This was naturally an extreme statement of "generalizing," which aroused some stubborn compatriots to criticize it, believing that he was increasing the prestige of others, as if saying that the Western moon was better than the Chinese moon.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need to be too extreme. Among Chinese compatriots, there are indeed many who do not understand humor; even those who are not used to the truth are not uncommon and there are practical witnesses. Treating the truth as a joke, this is a terrible symptom.</p>
<p>Recently, the "Atomic Pen King" Baron Bich, flew in on the "Air France" plane, and flew back. Someone asked Bich and his two co-pilots what they would do in the short term. The three answers were simple, clear and interesting. The first person said: "Sleep!" The second person said: "Eat and sleep!" The third person said: "Eat, sleep, and get married!"</p>
<p>Because these three answers are simple, clear, and innocently interesting, some people naively regard them as jokes and "laugh them off." People with this view mostly only know how to eat, sleep, and get married and know nothing else. They don't know that Bich and his group's statements are the most practical truths, because after their feat of staying awake and working for three hundred and thirty nights, and successfully completing the new speed record for circumnavigating the globe, don't they need to eat and sleep to compensate for their past fatigue? As for breaking the flight record first and getting married later, it is also realistic enough, and it is in line with the Chinese spirit of "the wedding night in the bridal chamber and the moment of being named on the gold list," right? I believe that only by unifying the reality of ancient and modern, both Chinese and foreign, can we avoid treating the truth as untruth, or treating the truth as a joke.</p>
<h3>The Fat Club</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The newspaper says: the fat people in Jiangxi, have recently initiated the establishment of a "Fat Club", dividing fat people into five levels: super fat, big fat, medium fat, small fat, and almost fat. They widely send out "spleen chains" and widely recruit fat friends, and everyone is having a lot of fun. At the same time, it is said that many of the fat people listed as initiators are celebrities of today.</p>
<p>The so-called fat people must be people with full heads and stomachs, with big bellies, which is due to excessive fat in the body and the ability to be relaxed and happy, which leads to fatness. Of course, a person who has to worry about firewood and rice every day, or even cannot afford to eat red rice and green vegetables, will never get fat.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "Fat Club" can be said to be a wealth group, it is a sneer at the thin and a kind of irony; and one person is fat, ten thousand people are thin, which is an even more heartbreaking fact.</p>
<h3>The Poison of Slave Education</h3>
<p>— Zi Hua</p>
<p>Various Misunderstandings of Taiwanese Compatriots</p>
<p>Taiwan was unfortunately occupied by Japanese imperialism for fifty-one years. During these fifty-one years, in addition to relentlessly exploiting the blood and sweat of Taiwanese compatriots, the Japanese also implemented a kind of education called "Imperialization," trying every possible means to make Taiwanese compatriots forget their motherland, despise their motherland, and become obedient subjects and slaves of their "Emperor." Therefore, today, when Taiwan has returned to the territory of the motherland, there are indeed many Taiwanese compatriots who have not only forgotten the language, writing, and thoughts of the motherland, but also have many distorted understandings of the motherland. The author has traveled to Taiwan for more than a year, and knows quite well about the situation of the distorted thoughts instilled by the Japanese to Taiwanese compatriots, so I will briefly describe one or two to let the people of the country understand the depth of the poison of the slave education implemented by Japan in Taiwan.</p>
<p>A few days after I arrived in Taiwan last year, a Taiwanese compatriot asked me: "Sir, is the highest building in the motherland as big as the Shintai Company?" (Note: The Shintai Company is a department store in Taipei built with a five-story western-style stone building). I couldn't help but laugh when I heard this. Unexpectedly, not long after, another Taiwanese compatriot came to ask me: "Does the motherland also have electric lights like Taipei here?" At this time, I really didn't know how to tell him, so I had to answer him very vaguely, "The motherland has everything that is here, and the motherland has what is not necessarily here!"</p>
<p>The Japanese not only portrayed our customs to Taiwanese compatriots as being extremely crude, but also used extremely insulting tones towards our mainland compatriots to give Taiwanese compatriots a very bad impression. They said that the people of China only eat and do nothing, Chinese students only understand that the earth is round after graduating from high school, Chinese soldiers can't even fire their guns and run away when they are scared by the number of people, Chinese habits are weak, selfish, and impolite….</p>
<p>Taiwanese compatriots have been so deeply poisoned by the slave education of the Japanese, so the 228 Incident that occurred this time was certainly not accidental. In addition to sympathizing with and understanding them, we should quickly help them with re-education, which is the right way to do it.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Wang Tieshan</h3>
<p>— Yun Jian</p>
<p>Wang Hu Tieshan, a former Qing Dynasty scholar, was an honest and sincere gentleman. Even heroes like Yuan Shikai dared not disrespect him. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs planned to burn a large amount of opium confiscated from confiscation in a large kiln specially built in Pudong. Wang Tieshan served as a special commissioner of the Presidential Palace and came to Shanghai to supervise. At that time, the Shanghai Daoyin was Wang Gengting, who asked Tie Lao what preparations he had made? He said, "Since I am responsible for this task, I should clarify the truth in order to report back to Beijing." He asked Daoyin to send a guide, a small boat, and give him an ordinary admission ticket, and he would not need any special treatment. Daoyin knew that this old man was bookish, so he agreed. The next morning, Tie Lao took a servant, boarded the small boat, and crossed the river to enter the venue. He looked around in the crowded crowd. There were official seats, customs supervisors, Daoyin, diplomatic envoys, county magistrates, and consular leaders from various countries, and business leaders sitting among them. In front were hundreds of boxes of opium, sealed tightly. The staff in the venue were very busy. Soon, the boxes were opened, inspected, doused with kerosene, and thrown into the kiln for burning. The spectators whispered to each other, pointing at the tripod. Although the black smoke was billowing, there was no smell of opium, and Tie Lao also became suspicious. The next day, he went to the kiln again, personally scooped up a large bag of smoke ash, and took it back to Beijing to present to the President, pointing out that this was solid evidence of corruption in the burning of opium. Yuan said, "Sir, you have worked hard. I specially asked you to come to Shanghai to supervise, but it was just to show that my Presidential Palace has not been involved in corruption. If you insist on taking this as evidence of corruption, who delivered it? Who can testify? Perhaps someone will falsely accuse you of not getting what you wanted and using this fake ash as a trap. How will you explain yourself to the world? However, I deeply admire you as an honest and sincere gentleman, and you can also explain yourself. Being among heroes and ghosts is not the same thing."</p>

<h3>Talking About the Yellow River Flood Area</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou</p>
<p>Huo Baoshu, the Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, declared after inspecting the Yellow River flood area (the area bordering Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu) that the area has become a desert, and the soil is gradually deteriorating. If it is not cultivated and planted as soon as possible, it will be incurable in the future. The so-called incurable means that one day it will become a real desert, and it will not be possible to cultivate it and make it habitable for a while.</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign scholars who study China have said that the Chinese nation has been subjected to cruel natural selection for thousands of years. Our ancestors originally lived north of the Yellow River, where the climate was dry, which was indeed suitable for human survival. Unfortunately, the northern yellow sand is competing with us for land. It is gradually advancing southward, and the turbulent Yellow River often floods, submerging our houses and fields, forcing us to flee south. Although the people in the south have been able to open up a world and create the civilization of Jiangnan for thousands of years, our bodies have been severely damaged due to the hot and humid climate here. This is a serious blow to the superiority of our nation.</p>
<p>The pitiful thing is that this elimination is still going on. Droughts and floods not only make us poorer and sicker, but also make us develop selfish bad habits: because generous people are often eliminated under the suffering of hunger. Some people call the Yellow River the sorrow of China, and it should be said that this is where its correctness lies. The enemies faced by the Chinese nation in the north are certainly not just nature. Since the Zhou Dynasty, various northern ethnic groups have been constantly invading us. However, external disasters are never as cruel as nature, and never as tenacious as nature. Just look at the countless tribes that invaded us in the past. Where are they now? Only the desert and the Yellow River have never been willing to let us go, and are still killing the vitality of our nation today.</p>
<p>There is no weapon to resist these two great enemies, and that is science, which has been shouted loudly by everyone since the introduction of new ideas into China, but everyone still feels empty about it. Other countries also have similar enemies as the Yellow River, but they have all conquered them with science, and not only conquered them, but also utilized them. What about us? Just listen to Huo Baoshu's words: "It will be incurable if it is delayed any longer!"</p>
<h3>Record of a Precarious City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Manager Xie! Busy, I bet?" He pulled up a chair and sat opposite the old man, smiling.</p>
<p>"Not busy! Not busy! If you have something to teach, just say it!" Old Zhu had a feeling of respecting ghosts and gods but keeping them at a distance towards Old Zhu, so he had already decided to deal with him in a polite and smooth manner.</p>
<p>Old Zhu didn't get straight to the point, but first turned his head to stare at Jin Aili, who was leaning against the back of his chair.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, do you want to leave too?" Jin Aili also knew that the person who came to see the old man today would have nothing else to do, and she had not forgotten what she and Old Zhu had talked about yesterday.</p>
<p>"I myself don't want to leave yet." Old Zhu shook his head and gave Jin Aili a special look. "Miss Jin, I want to ask you to talk to Manager Xie, can you help Mrs. Hu?" He was afraid that Old Zhu would not understand for a while, so he added, "Help Mrs. Hu Juewen."</p>
<p>"Okay! We are leaving this afternoon...!" Jin Aili said very quickly, but she immediately regretted that she had spoken too quickly. She could clearly see the smiling Manager Xie sitting on the chair winking at herself repeatedly; so she remembered this morning the Defense Command introduced a Mrs. Lu, wanted to take the old man's car. There had been the Commander's word, and Mrs. Li's letter, but Old Zhu had cleverly refused. There was also a deputy manager of XX Bank who had come to talk for a long time, and as a result, Old Zhu had agreed to take him to Liuzhou alone, on the condition that XX Bank would lend Old Zhu 10 million at 3% interest first.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, I'm really sorry," Old Zhu said. "Aili, she doesn't know my difficulties. Heaven and earth are my witness, I, Zhu Xinong, love to help my friends! Especially you, sir? It's just that my jeep is very old and can only seat four or five people at most; there are seven people in my company who have to leave, plus the two of us. Mr. Zhu,"</p>
<p>Old Zhu didn't really hear what he said next, the previous few sentences were enough. Zhu Zhaonian really regretted coming to hit this nail today.</p>
<p>Now, she didn't really have the courage to let Jin Aili speak to Old Zhu on his behalf, and she didn't know what to say. Whether Old Zhu's words were true or false, she couldn't figure it out at all. But she also saw Old Zhu's disappointed expression.</p>
