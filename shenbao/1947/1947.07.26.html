<h3>物資供應局盛明　聨合社報道不確</h3>
<p>美未交我五億元物資</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕關於本市各報廿四日所載，聯合社七月廿二晶華盛頓電訊，報道美國運華剩餘物資消息，頃據行政院物資供應局發表聲明如左：華府電訊所載數字，恐將使一般人對中國至目前爲止，所獲剩餘物資之匯寶數字，發生誤會，殊有加以說明之必要。查依據一九四六年八月卅日協定所規定，美國政付所擬轉讓與國可移動之物資，其估計之總額（照成本計算），爲五億美元，其中僅價値一億七千萬美元之材料及配備，業經宣佈爲剩餘物資，該項全部物資，未必完全爲中國所獲得，蓋此項宣佈，可能遭受阻碍與撤回也。關於五億天元可移動物資之大量出售，戳至一九四七年六月卅日爲止，中國所實際獲得者，約爲七千一百萬美元。至所稱美國已在九個月內轉讓中國，或撥入剩餘物資項內，依照成本價値五億美元之物資一節，係屬報道之錯誤，依照一九四六年八月卅日協定所規定，美國政府尙須以價値三億三千萬美元之剩餘物資，轉讓中國云云，</p>
<h3>民社黨全代會　明日正式揭幕</h3>

<h3>某著名經濟學家　主張即改革幣制　認此舉為解除當前經濟危機鑰匙</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕接近政府之某著名經濟學家，廿五日與記者幣制改革事，鄭重指出欲謀解除當前經濟危機，幣制改革實爲可資資利用用之主要鑰匙，此舉雖不能收藥到病除之全效，然若準備充分，考慮週密，並有毅然實行之勇氣，則現時大可行得。渠將改革幣制喻作身患重病者之求醫，據稱：我當前經濟情形之嚴重，有如一疾入靑肓之病夫，若再諱疾忌醫，定死無疑。求醫問疾，雖不一定即能妙手回春，然終較不醫而死爲愈也。</p>
<p>反對目前即行改革幣制者，認爲改革幣制必先具備下列三先決條件：（一）時局安定，（二）財政收支平衡，（三）物價平穩，渠認此種看法過於幻想，並倒果爲因。蓋上述三點若咸已實現，則又何需乎改革幣制。就當前時局言，禍亂短期內旣無法以其他方法解決，則唯有戡亂之一途，政府若能於一非作戰區域內」穩定幣値，則生產等咸能改上軌道，此時戡亂亦極有用，若必欲俟時局澄淸後再改幣制，則當前事實極爲明顯，混亂之幣制，必使投資與生產者裏足，生產萎頓，戡亂原動力豈不受其影響，因之，由於局勢不安定，幣制改革益感需要。</p>
<p>就平衡財政言，財政之主要收入爲稅收，在目前幣値日形低落之情形下，上月之征稅收入，下月由國庫支出使用，其價値已減低一半，國家收入如何得以增加，預算如何得其平衡，唯有幣値穩定，再可計算收支，並進而求其平衡，此點亦應加以辨明。</p>
<p>渠並舉出多種理由，說明改革幣制後所可發生之良好影響，據稱：由於幣制不能立時改革，由於政府對外匯採取釘住政策，僑匯乃紛紛逃港，雖有緝私等辦法，然走私依然，同時，漢口等地資金亦紛紛南流，此對國家皆爲莫大損失。改革幣制後，當不致再有此種現象。</p>
<p>渠指出，由於種種原因，幣制改革實屬切要，而欲改革，則以即時實行爲宜，蓋若再長此蹉跎，即至本年年底，其危險亦有不堪設想者，屆時國家因不改革幣制而所歲之損失，亦將較目前冒險改制重太多多。至改革幣制第一要件，爲新幣應與美金發生聯　，蓋我國貨幣爲世界貨幣之一，當不能脫離世界關係，此一聯緊對國人心理可起一種安定作用，將來有游資者，亦可不必競購美鈔或從事投機，依渠估計，若以我國手頭所有之外匯黃金再加以僑胞匯回之資金用充新幣準備金，同時在對外貿易上稍加限制，以去年國際貿易差額爲準則，此數至少可貼一年而有餘，若能有國際支援，當更不成問題。</p>
<p>記者詢以新幣發行後現有法幣將如何處理，渠答：俄國當時會兩種幣制同時並用，此亦爲一種辦法，新幣初發行時，可與舊幣訂一隨時可以伸縮之比價，隨情形而漲縮，同時，停止舊幣發行，以新幣收回舊幣，而新幣之發行又爲公開者，人民對新幣有絕對信仰，　幣亦不雖於最短期內收回。幣制改革以後，政府可實行小規模之生產計劃，民間生產亦可因有保障而向榮，而國家之預算亦可以幣値穩定而漸得平衡。</p>
<p>此一不願宣布姓之經濟學家，對全國經委會最近所通過之經濟怍革方案之幣制部門亦表贊同，渠出，幣若不改革，經濟決無法改善，同時，方案所稱「政府應有充分準備，並選擇適當時機，整理幣制」，所謂「適當時機」究何所非，目前我國物價有增至五萬倍者，若干五金材料已漲至十萬倍以上，此種倍數爲古今中外任何國家所無，此時不再改革幣制，豈必待物價漲至二十萬倍後再改之。渠對於當局對改革幣　事諱莫如深，亦不以為然，認除對將來新幣與英匯之價格應守秘密外，其他皆應公開討論。</p>
<p>渠之結論謂：改革幣制並非」服「萬應劑」，改制後，一切經濟問題並非立能全部迎刃而解，然改制終較不改爲愈，目前即改，終較他日改革爲好，政府若能抱有決心，並經詳細考慮成敗得失，則此時改制·贊大可行得。</p>

<h3>參會駐委會議席上　俞鴻鈞報告財政　我國入超情形已漸好轉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕財長會鴻　，廿五日晨出席參會駐委會，報吿兩年來財政狀况。</p>
<p>（一）財部最近治理財政車點，勝利兩年以來，政府無日不求和平，但和平至今尙未能實現，故人心浮動，社會不能安定，而市塲恐慌，商人投機等現象繼而泛濫於黃金市塲，促使物價波動、幣値低落，此種現象，互爲因果，財部對此，時時均加以處置。自總動員令頒布後，正謀厲行即約，增加收入，以求財政經濟之穩定。政府相信可以克服困難，前頒經濟緊急措施方案施行後，一般物價曾慍和下跌，惟該項方案係以政治力量干涉經濟行為，雖可見效一時，但不龍持　甚久，為謀長期安，當應與平時措施相轉而行。</p>
<p>（二）稅收方面，增加收入·惟有增加租稅爲合理，已辦者爲，一。卅六年度直接稅之徵收，在查賬之手　部份，曾引起上海工商界之反對，認爲，賬人員有弊，且手續麻煩，現己決成化稽徵，進行可順利。二·特種營業稅已開始辦理，惟綏靖區係免稅一年。三·貨物稅率，原定爲三月　整一次、但目前爲增加收入計·已決定按照實際批價，隨時調整增加。四、財產稅，前經財政部擬定「一次財產稅」辦法，經全國經濟委會討論後，並檢討德。比各國徽收財產稅均吿失敗，故改爲「建國特捐」，財部對比</p>
<p>已擬有具體辦法，其要點爲：一·以個人爲對象，二·包括動產不動產在內，三·五億元起徵，四·辦理程序1申報，2提名，3縣市政府及地方民意機構組調查會，以調查之，中央則設督導委會，五·中央部份由直接稅局徵收，地方者由縣市政府代辦。各項稅收情况如上，但仍不能求得收支之平衡。</p>
<p>（三）海關緝私，在華南一帶走私特甚，現分水陸兩路設卡及布置巡邏艦隊，以加强緝私，並嚴防武裝走私。</p>
<p>（四）進出口貿易情形，去年一年中，我國進口貨總額　一五〇一一億，出口貨總額爲四一二〇億，幾為四與一之比，本年度一至五月進口貨總額爲一八〇九三億，出口貨總額爲九〇一三億，玉個月來計入超九〇八〇億，惟以比例計之，計一至三月出口貨額佔進口貨額三分之一，四月份則佔五分之二，五月份佔五分之四，入超逐漸減少，情況自已轉好。</p>
<p>（五）管制金融辦法，一面取締不健全行莊，同時加强管制，對於都市金融機構，則切實督導，一面緊縮信用，但在正當頭寸之調撥及生產貸款之貸給，仍應由中央銀行辦理。</p>
<p>（六）對美貸款問題，在魏德邁特使來華後，我對財政情况曾提供各種有關資料，以便研究，惟吾人仍應自政治方面求得解決，如我在政治或軍事方面有辦法，美自可應允貸款。　俞氏報吿畢，武肇煦，薛明劍等參政員提出數項口頭質詢，（一）稅制好而稅人不好，商人因而採用兩道賬，使查賬辦法落空，故稅收制度似應老慮。（二）五萬元大鈔是否即將發行。（三）如何使預算平衡等項，俞氏簡答如次：（一）稅人雖不好，但仍須　雖，並請北家帮忙，並帮同檢。（二）平衡預算補貼差額目前仍用發行以補救，如以增加稅收求解決，則人民負擔即過重。（三）關於華北方面外匯聯鎖制度，全國經委會正研究中。（四）五萬元大鈔之發行並無其事。</p>

<p>「我國爲最先抵禦日本侵略國家，八年抗戰，損失慘重。對日和議，不但淸算日本過去數十年之侵略，亦未來國運興衰及世界和平之所緊，如政策錯誤，應付失當，將貽禍無窮·查自美國統馭對日管制以來，步步扶植，有目共睹；此次邀請遠東盟國聚議對日和約問題，　有其國策之立塲，各有關國家間利害不同，方針亦異。我政府面臨此國民所付託之重大任務，當集思廣益，應由會參加對白和議代表團之組織，以增强外交陣容，同時須堅持和議否決權，以爭取主動地位。辦法：（一）請政府保留對日和護否決權，以爲參加和會之條件。（二）由會參　對日和議代表團之組織。」</p>
<h3>對日和約未訂前　應暫緩開放貿易　參政員兩提案合休閒鞋審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕對日貿易之開放問題，多數參政員咸不表贊同。廿五日晨參會駐委會中。討論下列兩項提案，（一）鄭揆一江庸彭革陳等三人提：「請政府在未簽訂對日和約前醫緩開放對日貿易案」，（二）薛明劍等提：「擬請政府暫緩開放對日貿易案」，當經提案人詳爲說明，認爲對日貿易一經開放，則無異摧殘我國工商業，應立即請政府老盧暫核開放。張潛華參政員則反是，渠認爲開放對日貿易係麥克阿瑟所宣佈，吾人宜尊重麥帥之主張。最後決定，兩案合併提交全體審查會審查，提下次駐委會討論。全體審查會定廿六日長召開。茲誌兩案內容如次：</p>
<p>鄭揆一等提案</p>
<p>鄭揆一等三人提：請政府在未簽訂對日和約前暫緩開放對日貿易案。</p>
<p>理由：吾國被迫抗戰時歷八載，生民流離，慮舍爲墟，勝利兩年，舉國上下所共注目之對日和約，尙未簽訂，而侵略者已日圖伸張復活，與論惶惑，人心不安，而目前政府忙於戡亂，對於外交缺乏明確態度，雖對日本欲保持大國民寬大之風度，然先訂和約，次開放貿易，乃至扶使日本走上民主道路，均應由正常合理程序，不意盟國佔領統帥，未先徵求各同盟國同意，擅自准許日本政府自本年八月十五日起開放對外貿易，我工商興論各界多相繼執言，籲請政府老慮停止開放，未蒙採納，而報載本月二十二日政務會議，對於開放原則反表贊成，事關車要國策，本會豈能緘默？（一）兩年來盟國佔領當局執行美國國政策，返欲開放日本對外貿易，以圖減輕美國對日佔領之負担，美國爲工業高度發達國家，絕不虞受日貨傾銷之影響，我國生產落後，決不能與美國亦步亦趨，而需有獨立自立，逈異美國之對日貿易政策。（二）查日本政府計劃本年度輸出物資，以紗布，纎緋品·生絲·人造絲爲大宗，用以換取棉花·羊毛。及重工業原料或製品，其圖自中國輸入者，爲食鹽·大豆·食糖等，在客觀上必使中國工業重陷不振地位。（三）戰後吾國工業正在萌芽，若令日貨大量轍入，併美貨角逐於各市塲上，則以七倍於日本之上海工資，其成品將受嚴重之打擊，南洋羣島國貨之市塲亦水將絕跡。（四）中日昆鄰，本有無相通之原則，貿易開放僅爲時間遲早問題，爲作未雨綢繆計，應及時招集工商專家人民社團代表，廣徽博引，製定對日貿易政策，以爭取主動地位。</p>
<p>辦法：（一）請政府在和約未簽訂前暫羅開放對日貿易。（二）召集人民社團代表，並羅致工商專家，制定貿易方案，以爭取對日貿易主動地位。</p>
<p>薛明劍等提案</p>
<p>薛明劍等提：擬請政府暫緩開放對日貿易案。</p>
<p>理由：（一）和約尙未簽訂，賠償尙未履行，我國在法理上無開放對日貿易之必要。（二）日本發表計劃在本年度內對我國貿易擬出超五十萬美金，繼續其經濟侵略略，不言可知。（三）在發展民族工業各條件中，均有不利。（四）八年抗戰，血跡未乾，餘痛猶在，無論工商田及全體人民，在最短期內絕無願與日本貿易。（五）勝利以來，日貨絕跡中國市塲，與人民生活絕無影響，足見對日貿易無老慮價値。</p>
<p>辦法　　與日本　時　通有無起見，可將過去已與日本進行之物物交　辦法予以改善或擴充，一俟賠償間題解決，商約訂立後後再行開放對自貿易。</p>
<h3>五監委　決再提出建議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十五日電〕萬燦等五監委，以彼等所提停止開放對日貿易緊急動議，政府未予採納，現正草擬另一建議，加强稅明停止開放對日貿易理由。此一建議日內抑可提出。</p>
<h3>張羣勱談話　麥帥對日　不夠了解</h3>
<p>美朝野過於樂觀</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張君勵於昨日記者招待會中表示：對日和會中，我國必須要求澈底解除日本武裝，如此方可保障和平。所謂日本之民主化，實爲表面而不澈底者，不啻為一幕戲劇，專用以愚弄美國。麥帥對日本不够了解，而美國朝野對日本過於樂觀。例如美國允許日本恢復一三七年之工業水準，實則此乃不可能　　因　　　此水準，首先由　國　　　　原　故也。</p>
<h3>全國工協代青　向各機關請願</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十五日電〕全國工業協會，爲反對關放對日貿易，推理監事吳蘊初，胡伯翔，陶桂林，田和鄉等，於二十五日分往各有關機關請願。經部由陳啟天接見，表示（一）對日貿易，政府將予愼重規劃，嚴格限制；（二）派赴日本商人六十四人，有詳細之分類，且嚴格審查其在商界之信譽，（三）工協請願代表所提意見，願盡量老慮接受。財部由李儻接見，安慰各代表等不必過慮，政府自將有所辦法。政院由梁穎之參事代見，與各代表詳細研討所提意見，允轉陳張院長。</p>
<h3>麥帥批准貸款　助日復興煤礦</h3>
<p>〔中央社東古廿五日電〕麥帥已准貸款十一億一千四百萬日圓予經指定之廿三家煤礦公司，此等公司擁有日本全國煤礦總量百分之九十，此項貸款被指定用在復興日本煤礦及擴充設備方面。盟　員指稱：此項貸款旨在增加日本國內之煤礦，以作經濟復興之起點。按日本煤礦工業，獲得此頃貸款後，可望將目前每年煤斤產量之千四百萬噸，至一九四八年提高至三千萬噸，此廿三家煤礦全司中，以三井礦　株式會社及日菱礦業株式會社所得貸款數目最多。計三井三億六千三百萬日圓，三菱二億六千三百萬日圓圓。</p>
<p>盟國將准日本　動用黃金寶石</p>
<p>〔聯合社華感頓廿四日電〕此間今日得悉：盟國方面將經由遠東委員會勸令麥帥，依據准許日本恢復私人貿易政策，動用該國黃金寶石，資助其工業復興。日本此項資產，可値美金一億五千萬元以上，足資購買外國原料，俾使現在停閉之工廠得以開工，以應八月十五日私人貿易開放後外商需求。日本黃金寶石之財力，雖不足以迎合其全部工業需要，但亦足以迅速作爲初步向國外採購原料之資金。日本此項黃金寶石，原已指定作爲賠償之用，可不政變更原意，蓋麥帥奉令將加以變賣取得美金償付原料貨價，但亦規定於關係各國要求分配時，日本必須設法將其贖回，以供賠償之用。</p>
<p>盟總圖早訂定　日圓臨時匯率</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿五日電〕據時事新聞消：息日本貿易應及總部專　認爲早日訂定日圓外匯率，對日本貿易有利，故臨時廳率亦望於最近日訂定。又匯率之確數若干，雖尙無所悉，唯成信美金一元，約合日圓一百至二百圓，且　在外　　　　　到來前訂定　　　　　　　　　　　　量　　　　　　本　　其　　而能自立，使佔領工作早日成功，然外國商人對此能否滿意，尙未可知。</p>
<h3>國際五統計會議　定期在華府舉行　我已派定正副代表出席</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕據關係方面獲息：感大之世界統計大會，及國際統計學會第廿屆會議等五種會議，將於本年九月八日至十八日在華府舉行。本次大會係由聯合國發起，美國政府召集，杜魯門總統担任大會名譽主席，被邀請出席有五百餘人。我國政府已派主計處主計官兼統計局局長朱君毅博士爲中華民國代表、專家金國寶敎授爲副代表，前往出席。聞大會討論之主題，將爲國際統計方法之統一，與國際統計資料之如何比較，尤將注意解決世界人口普查，與國際財富及所得估計等之技術上問題。</p>
<h3>立院經外兩委會　後日舉行聨席會</h3>
<p>再審　中英穿運協定</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕立院經濟外交兩委會，定廿八日舉行聯席會，再度審查中英空中運輸協定。立院原定舉行臨時會，現已決定不再開會，俟復會後再予追認。</p>
<p>〔本報昆明二十五日電〕中英及中美航空協定，中均指明昆明爲理想之航空基地。茲悉英美政府均將於今秋派員來昆視察。</p>
<h3>京滬記者團抵漢</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕京滬記者團一行七人，今午自京飛漢後，即拜訪程主任及孫副主任蔚如，晚七時應此間報聯會公宴，明起訪問各界，預定留漢三日。</p>
<h3>對日和會問題　蘇復文抵華府　美堅持原建議</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿四日電〕美國務院發言人今宣佈：蘇聯對美國建議舉行十一國家對日和會之答復，已於今晨由美駐蘇大使史密斯，以電報拍至華府。發言人稱：美國認爲蘇聯之照會，係一對案，而非一「全然之拒絕」。蘇聨建議依照對德和約之程序，中美英蘇四强外長，應首先草擬和約，據美官員表示，美國堅持十一國家會議，唯如其他國家寗願延遲會期，美國或可同意。國務院至今宣佈收到之答復，僅有英國紐西蘭，奧大利亞，蘇聯及荷籣，僉信其他國家之答復，亦已送達國務院，唯尙未宣佈。</p>

<h3>社論　正視中國當前的局勢</h3>
<p>——並迎魏德邁軍蒞滬</p>
<p>杜魯門總統特使魏德邁將軍偕同專家來到中國，據公布的消息，爲的是調查事實，對中國局勢作一個正確的評價。對將軍之東來，本報旣曾著論，致其歡迎之忱，茲更願就將軍來滬之際，對中國當前的局勢，約略有所指陳。我們首先要指出的就是現在當前的中國局勢，其間的因素本非單純，而且又是積多年來演變的結果。它們之以現委態出現，原有其歷史的背景。任何對於中國局勢的估計，必須將這個歷史因素正確地估計在內。自動員戡亂之令發後，中國又已回復到戰時體制。我們剛獲得了對日戰爭的勝利結束，如今又進行着另一作戰；此在中國人民原非他們的期望，只是他們戚覺到當前的局勢，除了動員戡亂完成憲政之外，實在沒有旁的途徑可循。在經過了八年長期抗戰之後，中國人民所希望的，同時也是中國政府所不惜一再忍讓以求的，原是和平秩序的回復，使人民及國家能够有一個稍資喘息的機會；其奈共匪根本不以人民及民族利益爲重，稱兵割據，禍國殃民，全國人民痛定思痛，以爲共匪不除，舉國將永無寗日，當此時會，應以果敢決斷之精神，將此危害國家民族的毒瘤，施行手術，予以割除·政府俯順民情，於是有動員戡亂命令的頒發。現在戡亂之令旣下，政府與全國人民今後一致努力的中心，便在戡亂，這是目前一切努力的鵠的。</p>
<p>然而，如前所述，中國局勢之發展到現階段，原是歷年演變的結果，本非一種偶然事件。就政治方面來說，它之所以發展到現階段，實與近年來國際局勢的演變，存着不可分離的關係。在政治的領域內，中國局勢之發展到現階段，主要是由於中國承受了一份中國本身沒有意志可表示的遺產：雅爾達。在納粹瀕於崩潰而日本的命運亦已注定了的時侯，這一「君子協定」的成立，實已招致了像目前出現在中國這樣局勢的原因。中國為了接受這份它沒有表示過意志的遺產，於是以極大的忍讓，具着如壯士斷臂那樣的心情，和蘇聯訂立了條的，重申友好之誼。在這中間，中國的友人故羅斯福總統也與世長辭，留下了杜魯門總統來擔當他所未完成的事業。戰後中國局勢之所以有現階段的態勢，這不能不說是一個主要的關鍵。</p>
<p>社魯門總統承故羅斯福總統未竟之業，特派馬歇爾元帥爲其特使，來華調處。元帥以退休之身，不辭勞瘁，萬里東來，中國人民無不表示崇高的敬仰與股切的期望；然而可遺憾的是元帥一年來的努力，却未能使禍國殃民的共匪放棄其主張，或作任何讓步，以求國內的統一和平的得以恢復。在馬帥留華期內，共匪卽已發動大規模的反美運動，並公然詆毁政府，此其行徑，在馬帥固早已洞若觀火。馬帥一年來在華努力之終歸泡影，更明示中國局勢是在一個較大的國際局勢的陰影下發展着的。任何使中國局勢與世界局勢分離的努力，對於中國局勢的改善，不但並無裨益，抑且可以說是有害。我們必須在一個正確的角度下，纔能透視中國的局勢，而能對中國的局勢作正確的估計。</p>
<p>在此情勢之下，中國政府已儘可能地在它的權力以內，實施政治的改革。國民大會的召開和憲法的制定，已爲此後中國的民主憲政奠定了萬世不拔之基，且在黨政尙未實施之際，政府爲表示與民更始和還政於民的決意，自動地取消了一黨統治的局面。今日中國的政府已包括了三個政黨及無黨無派的社會賢達，是政府的基礎業已擴大，此在中國政府，可以說是盡了最大的努力。</p>
<p>講到經濟方面，現在中國所遭迅到的經濟危難，原與中國政治局勢的演變，具着不可分離的關係。共匪的存在，使中國經濟的澈底改革，包括幣制的澈底改革，成爲一件不可能的事。嚴格言之，中國政治局勢中這一毒瘤如不割去，一切治本的治療，是不能有功效的。就以改革或整理幣制來說，我政府早有決心，張行政院院長亦已言之：祇因共匪作亂，整理或改革幣制，現在猶非其時。但政府在它的權力以內，自應儘可能的來挽救目前的經濟頹勢，它不能放棄這種責任這是爲此，所以我們看見有種種經濟上的管制，包括輪出入的管制在內。旣然有了管制，對於自由於是就有了限制。在此情形之下，自由的限制，原非得已。管制政策的實施，很可能的對在華美商，尤其戚到不便。他們剛放棄了「特權，」而現在所遭遇到不是平時的自由，却是戰時的管制；此在增進中美商務關係的人士，他們的心情是可以了解的。但我們要指出的是：中國政府並不以爲現行的種種管制辦法，極無修改的餘地；只要理由充份，我們深信中國政府是隨時準備接受建議，來將它們予以修正的。至於手續的繁複和稽遲，以及庶吏奉公精神的間或不免欠缺，政府也隨時在加以注意，設法改善。目前中國是處在一個非常時期，我們應抱着極大的忍耐。</p>
<p>總之，目前的中國經濟情形，是與政治局勢具着不可分離的關係的；而政治局勢之發展到現階段，又與國際局勢相關聯。我們要澈底改善中國的經濟情形，非將中國的政治局勢予以澄淸不可，此所以目前政府與人民一致努力的中心，便在戡亂建國；必將禍亂戡除，然後纔談得上建設。至於講到國際局勢，目前旣有杜魯門全義，旣有馬歇爾計劃；此與國際局勢的澄淸大有裨益；不過國際局勢的演變將如何反應到中國，那就要看我們的隣邦如何自處了。不用說，中國人民所期望的就是我們戰時的盟友，隔太平洋相望的隣邦，能够有更明顯積極的表示，此不僅與中國及遠東局勢有關，抑且關係世界整個的持久和平。其父將控工務局失職</p>

<h3>英同意召開華府會議　會商德煤斤增產　會議經過情形將隨時通知法國</h3>

<p>上海市商會爲對日恢復通商尙非其時，頃特電　國府行政　　經濟部、請令飭主　　暫停「開放對日貿易」之老慮。文云：「自政府主管方面進行開放對日貿易後，本市工業界惶惑至甚，蓋恐開放之後，我喘息未定之脆弱工業，勢必感受重大成　。此係實情，絕非危言聳聽。查日本國內工業設施，在戰時破毀尙徴，戰後的復興，亦有一日千里之勢。重工業縱受管制，經工業則大抵均得自由發展。倘狹其舊日維勢，捲土重來，我國脆弱之民族工業，決非其敵。迨至水已成舟，而欲再加管制，恐已尾大不掉，徒興太阿倒持之感，追悔莫及矣。故爲保育我國工業　礎計，不應輕予開放日本貿易，更從國際法例以管，目前對日和約，尙未訂立，戰事狀態，似未完全消滅，若在此時際，而竟談對日通商，恐非正常之舉。故在對日和約未訂立以前，亦即中日國際關係尙未恢復以前，似不宜遽行通商。其次，日本蹂躪我國者八載之久，公私損失，不可勝計。現在賠償問題，尙未解決，而率與恢復通商關係，亦將爲識者所齒冷。是以從一般國際常例言，我國此際固不應輕言對日貿易，即其他昔會對日宣戰之國家，似亦不宜於國際關係恢復正常以前，老慮及此。</p>
<p>絕非猶存敵愾故作歧視</p>
<p>我中華民族，素以和平互助，爲對待國際之宗宗旨，對於鄰近國家雜持友好，互通有無，原所贊同，以上所陳絕非猶存敵　，故作歧視，實因從國內民族工業立塲言，或從國際開關係以言，如於對日和約訂立，國際關係恢復正常以後，再就連勝經濟上需要，及民間工商業可能互助胟濟之範圍內，審愼研究具體辦法，以謀恢復兩國之正常貿易，方屬允當。若謂政府需要日本器材及原料，不容或緩，則目前中央信託局，已在辦理採購，固不必待諾對日貿易之開放。與其開放後再加管制，多滋流弊，不如暫維現狀，留待和約訂立，賠償解決後再考慮。總之，對日貿易之開放，影響過鉅，必須審愼將事，統盤籌計，免蹈戰前受人經濟侵略之覆轍，理合電請鋻核，令飭主管機關，暫停開放對日貿易之考慮，以正視聽」。</p>
<h3>國貨工廠聨會　電歸停止考慮</h3>
<p>上海市國貨工廠聯合會昨亦電請中央停止老慮開放對日貿易，原電略稱：「屬會爲保存國貨一綫生機，並爲維護千萬工友生活起見，謹特籲懇鈞座俯予察核，在對日和約未經簽訂，曁損害賠償未經議定以前，堅決主張停止開放對日貿易之老慮，並中止派遺商務代表赴日，以定國策，而重主權。」</p>
<h3>生產促進會滬會　亦議瘊反對開放</h3>
<p>中國生產促進會滬分會，昨在會議室召集本市工商各界，商討對日貿易問題。商討結果、可分二點：（一）在和約未簽訂前、反對開放對日貿易。（二）爲適應實鄉情形，擬純請政府擴充物物交換，免使我國之工商業趨於絕　。一面並電呈行政院，經濟部籲請停」考慮開放，以保我工商業。</p>
<p>又全國船聨與上海市輸船商業同業公會亦定今日下午召開理監聨席會議，鄭重討論此對日貿易問題。</p>
<h3>日人長於走私　將來漏必鉅　機聯會胡西園發表意見</h3>
<p>據機聯會常務理事胡西園談，在和約未訂立，賠償未確定前，即行開放對日貿易，時間未免過早。且我國所需者，如人造絲，肥田粉，，以及各種機器，均非普通商品，亦在輸入之列，雖有管制機關從事管制，但日人對走私有獨特技能，假定輸入規定爲九，千萬金，而事實走私必數倍於此，而我國輸出四千萬元，因官定外匯上黑市相去過鉅，恐難達此數，出入相較，漏巵必鉅。故吾人於對日貿易未開放前，　就技　問起詳細檢討，務使毫無遺憾，同時我工業界，必須在政府協助之下，打開出路，使能與日本貨在南洋市塲競爭，此點與日貨侵入同樣重要，亦不能不不加注意及之也。</p>

<p>事實經過</p>
<p>據起訴書稱：隊被害人仇連環，無恒業，遊手好閒。嗣　綠得任職中統局調支員，及高士滿舞廳稽查，氣勢益盛。平日恃强凌厲，人多側目切齒，致所結營怨不一而足　尤其與盛樹根，傅其福，及逸犯封仁義，白癩痢等，結怨最深，久蓄加害之意。本年五月卅日，封仁義，白癩痢，分別召集徒衆毛慶雲，阿金根，王阿巧，俞才根，王阿狗，施國光，周福慶等七人，關室北京路中華新旅社十六號房間，會商加害仇連環事宜，並於事先邀約盛樹根加入，盛以力弱，懼不勝任。再增邀綽號南方大力士之葉東英，及東方大力士之魏曉陽，及榮良江，儲樹榮，運同不詳姓名者多人，共同實施。是晚封仁義等即</p>
<p>各懷利刃</p>
<p>自中華新旅社前往靜安寺路高士滿無廳，盛樹根等亦間道馳抵該舞廳，均西散徘徊門首，意圖伺仇外出，即協力加害。適是晚仇已先期他出，遂相左，未獲結果而返。翌日復由白癩痢召其徒項銀泉加入，餌以酬報，項欣然應命，隨即同往中華新旅社協議。晚膳後另購利刀二柄備用，仍由封仁義白癩痢率領，一行於晚間十時許抵福州路中央西餐社門首伺仇。而盛樹根等一行亦應約如期而至，仍四散伏處道旁。時</p>
<p>驟雨如注</p>
<p>至十時卅分許，仇自大西洋餐社疾趨而出，因步行甚速，不及追躡，仍未　加告，各廢然而返，改定翌日時間重集原址，伺機實施。次日即六月一日，盛樹根等以數謀來成，意殊憤懣，當約下午二時許，由魏曉陽約同李德勝，李斌，封仁義約同包永發，陳福根，馬才德，馬文奎等協助，並由不詳姓名者數人，先在小都會舞廳。由陳福根，馬文奎伏於金城　導社，臨時以電話相策應。是晚八時許，盛樹根等光赴復興園晚餐後，前往大西洋餐社門首，</p>
<p>四散分立</p>
<p>封白亦率同毛項及逸犯李斌，陳金根，王阿狗，王阿巧等，乘車前往。至十一時許，計仇連環當於此際自大西洋餐社外出，當由馬才德，陳福根，馬文奎等以電話通知小都會舞廳不詳姓名者諸人，一時畢集，並約定由封仁義，盛樹根高呼仇連環姓名爲號。少頃，仇果自大西洋緩步而出，盛即連呼仇姓名。仇聞呼却步返顧，號即趨前抽出</p>
<p>預藏利刀</p>
<p>猛砍仇右手臂等部，華一迅即將仇緊抱不放。項·李·盛·毛·儲·柴等五六人均趨前以所備刀棍分別砍毆。仇于負傷之餘，奮力以右手出所備手槍左右發射，項銀泉應設被中腰部，當由毛及逸犯揚囡囡扶掖雇登三輪車送中美醫院求治。餘衆見目的已達，且驟問槍聲，均一哄而散，常値崗警士發覺，將仇車送仁濟醫院，以傷重延至洋月二日上午四時不治身死。毛慶雲於事後旋又偕同楊囡囡赴項家探詢，爲警士捕獲。楊則</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕在夏門金門島華定島間斧頭灣內，觸石擱淺之海浙輪，所裝之玻璃砂，原係運往秦皇島，現正駁出運至厦門，轉裝海滇輪運秦。該輪觸石雖在淺水，無沉沒危險，惟出險甚爲困難。行總對該綸觸石擱淺事，非常重視，開昨派外傷拔師一名，乘機飛厦門轉道赴該輸出事處視察，並協助救獲。該輪有服務生王煥堂，在二十三日（該輪觸石後一日），突然自殺。據船長報吿稱，該服務生近日態度失常，會經同事屢加勸戒無效，忽於二十三日晨七時許將房門及鎖自狀，經發覺後施救不及身死，現在金門島棺殮，上海通訊處，爲新閘路戈登路一二六〇號錦豐水電村料行，該局得電後，已遣人通知</p>
<h3>四瞎子涉訟　摸索上法庭</h3>
<p>〔不報訊〕昨晨地院有四個　子訴訟，一時在庭上摸摸系索，即尊嚴之法官亦不免爲之忍俊不禁。緣本市星卜互助會爲加强各星卜家之互助而設立者，各發起人均努力往各處宣傳。本年五月間，原吿薛永明及婁德忠會同該會常務理事於忠祥等，前往虹口丹徒路一百十七號勸導同業加入，遇兩被吿同業錢忠揚。錢山華，當原吿勸導入會時，不但不理，且破口大駡。雙方各不相讓，錢中華更衝出門外扭住兩原吿，拿出小刀刺薛之左額及眉。乃由警局轉送法院審理。庭上訊問被吿時，彼等大呼寃枉，供稱兩原吿前來，實爲强索六萬元入會費，因而爭吵，並無刺傷等情。庭上以雙方各執一詞，尚待調查，改期再訊。</p>

<h3>緩徵免役　准駁之權　絕非保甲長等所能左右</h3>
<p>市政府民政處長張曉崧，對於壯丁申請緩征召及免役手續，最易發生誤解與敝　，特再闡明如下：</p>
<p>據報各區壯丁將申請書塡就送至保甲長辦公處時，保甲長及保幹事等，以在申請書上保甲長須爲蓋章，因此有些保甲長碍於情面，不查實情，率予蓋章，有些保甲長，則故意留難，不爲蓋章，致造成保甲長保幹事等，對於壯丁中請緩征召及免役，儼然有准駁之權力，於是壯丁則鑽營鬥路，弊寶百出，其實保甲長在申請書上，祇負忠實證明之責，並無准駁之權力，蓋壯丁緩征召及免役申請書，由保甲長蓋章證明後，送至區公所，由區級據實審查後。又由區公所送至市政府，會同市兵役協會，組織審查委員會，作最後之審核，經市審查會審查，確認其合於緩片召或免役之條件，於是再送至上海團管區司令部頒發緩征召及免役證，至此申請審查手續方始完成。所以頒發緩征召及免役證，是團管區之權，審查緩產召准許與否，是上海市審查會之責，絕非保甲長保幹事等所能操縱右左馮，或有准許駁斥之之權力也</p>

<h3>紡調會昨召開談話會　棉布議價從緩辦理</h3>
<p>待棉價格確定後再行評議布價</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會爲討論棉布議價事，於昨日下午四時許，在該會召集中國紡建公司，染織業公會，棉布業公會，及工商輔導處等，舉行非正式談話會。出席劉泗英，王啓宇，高秉泰，潘士浩，董久峯，歐陽崙等十餘人，由劉泗英主席，討論至六時許散會。</p>
<p>昨日交換意見結果，認爲目前棉布種類衆多，花色複雜，議價前似應有充份考慮，如遽予議定，執行時恐將遭遇困難。且棉布議價，需與棉紗議價配合，故不如　棉緩價格確實後，再行評議棉布價格。將來評議棉布價格時，將選擇若干種標然準布疋，先行議價，俾其他各式布疋，可比例評定議價。最後染業方面，暢述目前棉紗供應不能與染織業雷用配合情形，紡調會當着該業先行搜集詳細資料，提會參考，以便調整配紗數額云。</p>
<p>九複製業提供意見</p>
<p>〔又訊〕聞此次棉布議價，原係受市政府經濟會報會議之督促而行·近日市况平穩，明定議價，或將反生刺激。在會議之前二日，染織業代表會與劉主任委員縱談及此，故昨日之會議，乃移轉其重心於紗布調節之原則云。</p>
<p>潘士浩氏昨以複製業負責人之身份，提出染織，針織，手帕，毛巾被毯，內衣，手工棉織，駝絨，蓬帆，織帶等九個製造業之生產設備數字，說明棉紗不足情形，對於小型廠之一直被屛於配紗以外，更嚴舉其嚴重性。劉主任委員及工商輔導處歐陽處長，甚表重視，面囑潘氏補具書面，尤爲切實補救。</p>
<p>劉氏並再三聲明，各業公會務必爲詳實之統計，以爲配紗及代織之參考。據潘氏出語人云：日內即將召開複製九業會議，以與紡調政策取得聯絡云。</p>
<p>配售棉布情形一斑</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司某負責人，緬　該公司配售棉布事，特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>（一）外界對上次棉布漲風，歸咎於該公司供應過少。實則該公司經常維持充份之配售量，以六月份言，共配一，一一七，一一三疋，門售八八七，一一三疋。而該月份該公司上海各廠之產布總額，不過六五二，二〇五疋，尙不足本市門售之數，不敷者另由該公司外埠各廠供應。</p>
<p>（二）外界責難該公司配布量不平衡，惟公司每次配布，均係參照公司生產情形核配。而一般布莊，在布價高漲時，申配量即增加，布價趨跌時，申配量即减少。故與其謂供應不平衡，毋寗謂需求不平衡，</p>
<p>（三）外界有請該公司在每次配布前，預先公布配售量。實則該公司配布目的，在平抑棉布市價。如以業務秘密，先事宣布，反易為人操縱把持，實非得計云。</p>
<h3>絲織聨營公司　首期計劃已完成</h3>
<p>吾國絲織綢緞，過去銷售印度南洋一帶，爲數甚鉅。抗戰勝利後，因吾國經濟動盪不定，成木高漲，致國外市價，低於成本。本市絲織業，爲謀推廣國綢外銷，並解除絲織業嚴重危機，及增加國家外匯收人起見。商准中央銀仃，呈准行政院核准成立絲織品協導委員會，貸給所需原料，及一切工繳。一面由該業集炎組織上海絲織產銷聯營公司，劇一製造，嚴格管理第一期承織共計十一萬疋。由該公司委託同業二百另三廠。發動織機二千零七十二台，於三月中開始織造。自五月份起大部份已運銷國外其餘在本月底，可全部織造完成。國外綢商，以產品整齊優美，深表滿意。而印度，南洋曁中東伊朗伊拉克，波斯灣等地。均來電採購。售價亦日有起色。第一期綢疋售罄，可獲外匯二千餘萬羅比。目前該公司董事長駱淸華赴京向有關各機關報吿辦理經過。行政院張院長，王副院長全國經委會委員陳委員立夫，曁財經兩部，一致表示滿意。認爲與經濟改革方案中之「同業聯營」，「定貨制度」等辦法，深相符合。其他各業，均可仿照推行云云。該公司第二期產銷計劃已於月初呈送協導會。聞中央銀行張總裁，劉副總裁，中信局吳任滄局長等，對此極爲重視。正與協導會曁美國顧問詳細硏討。日內即可核定。訂約發料。俾該公司得繼續生產，數萬技工，不致因停工失業云。</p>
<h3>利買傳雨紛紜　華股展開漲風　升達限度者十六種之多</h3>
<p>華股連跌之後，昨疲後突起反動，廣帮金融帮連袂吸納，業中空頭，羣起抵補，外股得特殊刺激，首先猛躍。於是利買謠言，不一而足，冷熱各股漲停者有十六種之多。永紗漲停後，暗市喊價續昂半成光景。連朝鬱鬱之氣，至此一掃而空，頓見生氣蓬勃。空方業已動搖，大戶反賣爲買，趨勢可望更進一籌。</p>
<p>晨初以銀根鬆濫，買戶心有不甘，上塲見穩，遞永紗開後，九一號二三一號等進，至一九五元，二二三號一四二號一一號一一〇號九七號一六三號一四號八三號俱售尤以一五二號傾售最多。遞永紗曾低至一八〇元，即交永紗祇達一八二元低價。美亞經一八八號，六〇號二三七號一五六號二二三號一五七號一三三號之紛加了結，遞交跌至四一五元，即交跌至四〇四元。信和新光景福三者成交較少，此際亦難免同趨低落。後經七七號一〇四號九七號二三一號一二號買進，永紗升至一八八元，一五二號依然力悟，二〇七號亦供給現氷紗，此際尙現疲軟，錢兌業一三〇號續納現永紗，一〇二號一三三號一六〇號九一號一〇六號再進，遞永紗乃回升至一九一元。此時因一八六號供給氷紗新光景福信和，尙不脫盤局。</p>
<p>迨夫廣帮一六二號上塲買進，局勢始見轉變，萊中空方若二二三號二二四號二三一號八九號，補進不已，一五六號一一二號六九號一八三號一四號均加購買。十時半、商務首先掛高至漲停板，遞、水紗乃盤漲到二〇九元，一七三號一六九號乘高了結，而有掙扎。二三二號一六〇號一四二號一三七號一二九號一五七號三六號一一七號等突來猛購，火柴再由二二號掛漲停板，於是永紗現遞亦都吿漲停。局面改觀後，助買謠言紛紜，補空更股，氷紗進行貼價暗市交易，餘股若勤興由四二號，中法由一六八號！永公由四二號，信和即交由一五二號八四號二二三號，遞交由二一九號一六三號，景福由五六號，中紡由一四九號，榮豐由一〇四號八三號，新亞由一四一號（未成交），親華由一四一號，連袂宣吿漲達限度，全塲一致回漲。遞永紗由二二三號二二四號等進至二三〇元。</p>
<p>十二時光景，二三五號一四號一〇二號一度賣到漲停限度，終以七六號二七號九四號五五號仍進，二三二號一五六號復進現永紗，中英商約簽訂，外股怡紗更為　　，人心更見　目振作。最後遞氷紗喊高至二三三元，現永紗二二七元，而新光景福中絲勤興復達漲停矣。</p>
<p>結果較前收計即交股氷紗榮豐信和中絲商務火柴新光水公景福勤興中法新藥均吿漲停，美亞內衣統益中紡漲停後有回，均執升一成强。大通國貨新亞各漲半成强，華豐漲二成弱，景綸五和麗安水泥各漲一成强，遞交計美亞漲一成有零，華講漲停後有回，軋升一成半。氷紗信和新光永公景勤興均吿漲停，塲外各老股自微漲起迄一成弱不等，亦見十分俏利。</p>
<h3>國家行局　昨大額差出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日國家行局大額差出，計達六五五億元。聞中央銀行獨家差出達四百十餘億元。市塲銀根益見鬆動，暗息一角二分至五分。國家行局鉅額差出之主要原因，聞係前南流之資金，現已陸讀大批回籠云。</p>
<h3>去年茶貸抵押箱茶　仍按原定辦法收購</h3>
<p>關於去年度農民銀行受押箱茶，四聯總處爲體卹茶商艱困起見，特予收購，並一再延長申請收購期限，最後延長之五日，昨日（廿五）即吿屆滿。茶商代表雖再度晋京，請求增加收購價格，結果仍維持原議，箱茶收購問題，乃吿解決。</p>
<p>茶商方面亦已同意依照原核定價格，並依限於（廿五日）以前辦妥收購手續，如（廿五日）茶商不往申請，中信局決不延期，農民銀行對到期之箱茶，亦不通融，如不備款贖回申請收購，即履行契約行爲，處理其押品，仍交由中信局收購。</p>
<p>據悉：農行授押箱茶，屯綠部份茶商已全部贖回，售與法商，其不能外銷者，爲祁紅與平綠，尙未贖回者，祁紅有一萬五千箱，平綠約四萬箱，押款額近百億元，僅少數未到期，已到期者，農行已着手處理其押品，醞釀年餘之箱茶收購，至此乃吿一段落。</p>
<p>茶商請求收購陳茶</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代理政府收購三十五年度陳茶，昨爲申請收購截止之期。昨日下午，有茶商廿餘家，會銜函陳該局，申請對各茶商手中所存去年度陳茶，迅賜收購云。</p>
<p>外銷緣茶供求兩稀</p>
<p>又訊：自法商永興洋行，對於最近擬向非洲摩洛哥推銷之九百噸珍眉綠茶，需額漸吿足够以來，刻下活動之意，步呈鬆懈。但執貨者仍因市存虛薄，尙心猶　，故趨勢續有供求兩稀之象，交易寥若晨星，市氣高站有勁。他若低檔陳紅茶，出口商則猶有需求，過程不衰。各種內銷茶，際此夏日炎炎中，本街店莊及客帮之去化，英不依然遞增，且仍以本年度徽州烘靑，走銷活躍，更有與日同進之旣。</p>
<h3>統債邁進　外股續升</h3>
<p>公債昨賡續邁進，人心仍具幻想，成交增至三百餘萬，統丙晨開八八〇〇元，五三八室五〇三室俱進，步升至九八〇〇元，五五五室二三〇室逢高了結，退落少許收市。結果較前收計甲乙丙各漲八百元，丁升七百元，戊好九百元。</p>
<p>股昨怡紗所漲最勁，業外之刺激，加之中英商約有簽定之傳，有以致之。橡皮股亦被帶上，怡紗晨開七一〇〇〇元起，形成求過於供，籌碼不多，升至八四〇〇〇元高價而後轉盤，結果較前收計怡紗怡啤紙業各漲成半，會德豐鋼業亦好一成，餘股均升半成。</p>
<h3>銀行業公會　今日開會員大會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行商業同業公會第十四屆會員大會，已定於今日下午二時，假市商會舉行。各會員提案十餘件，業經該會理監事會，事前整理一過，將提交今日大會中討論，同時並將討論修訂同業業規云。</p>
<h3>全國水泥業公會　請擴充蔴袋限額　並請仍停外洋水泥輸入</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國水泥工業同業公會最近電請擴充第三季蔴袋限額。其要點爲　袋爲包裝水泥主要材料，全國水泥工廠，如將生產力量全部發揮，月需一百公斤蔴袋七百萬隻，其他各業需要亦多。該會前以第二季輸入限額，定爲美金八十五萬元，僅可進口蔴袋約一百五千萬隻，實屬杯水車薪，無濟於事，爰經分呈有關各機關，請將蔴袋輸入限額，特予寬放，結果未蒙照准。茲因第三季輸入限額、即將核定公佈，該會鑒於水泥生產、關係重要，而包裝材料，又不可一日或缺，經於日前分電全國經濟委員會，及遍入臨時管理委員會，請將蔴袋限額，儘量擴充，以維實業。至第二季蔴袋限額，水泥業計得百分之四九·二五，早經限額分配處依照全國各水泥廠用量核配竣事。但因進口商覓取印度出口證，至爲　緩，迄尚未能申請訂購。該會同業，以需用孔亟，對此成表遺憾云。</p>
<p>又該會電請當局，仍禁洋泥輸入。我國水泥工業，去年因外貨來華傾銷，一度感受威脅，幸蒙當局洞察艱危，先於訂購外匯，酌停供繼總對本年一二兩季輸入限額，完全停止，嘉惠頗多。茲因第三季限額，即將頒訂，而各廠數月來，積極增產，除供應各方需要外，已有過剩，爰經電請全國經委會及輸管會，對於水泥輸入限額，仍予停止，國產水泥工業登展前途，實深利賴云。</p>
<p>向日索償　水尼工廠</p>
<p>又該會向日索償水泥工廠，即可提川交涉。抗戰期間，我國水泥工業，經日人蹂躪八年，有被完全刼掠者，有遭慘烈轟炸者，有爲强佔使用，因而面目全非者，損害之重，國內工業界，實罕有倫比該會曾於月前推派陳漢淸奚正修等，晋京向賠償委員會，經濟部，外交部等請願，將日本水泥工廠，拆償我國。茲悉：經濟部及賠償委員會小組會議，均已通過。一俟提由全體會議決議，即可向遠東委員會正式提出云。惟聞日本方面，推說日本水泥工廠，多數已改爲其他工廠，故無拆灈價値。查經濟部組有拆遷日廠技術團，不日赴日工作，該會將請求准許推薦水泥專家一人參加，俾對日本水泥廠之調查，可更詳盡云。</p>
<h3>紗價稍見回昂　棉布買氣轉濃</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開因、紡建公司照例開紗，價格亂再度抑低。四二支日光紗，掛低至一千六百十萬元，人心頓呈疲軟，旋以市上銀根益見鬆濫，且已連瀉數天，紗廠因不敷成本，不肯輕易開售，一部份客帮及同業逢低稍有需求，行情微呈進展。</p>
<p>最後四二支藍鳳價回上至一千七百萬元，比上日回漲四十萬。廿支特雙馬一千一百八十萬，雙馬紗爲一千零五十萬，均升四十五萬至六十萬。其餘十六支及二十支卅二支等粗細各紗，亦一致上翔二三十萬至六七十萬元不一</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開時脚地仍虛、塲內拋售不寂，十二磅龍頭細布曾盤低至四十萬零六千元，迨至十時許，業中人以紗價回昂，銀根鬆弛，吸意加强，又有業外大戶乘低再度競進，散戶止賣轉吸，頓時塲內買氣甚濃。籌碼益形枯竭。</p>
<p>至最後龍頭細布回上至四十二萬六千元，比上日回漲七千元。五福彩球陽鶴藍鷄等各檔細布，亦升三五千至一萬元。漂布嗶嘰銷活者帶好五六千，本廠各布因實銷呆滯，市趨下游，惟藍布及士林布絕少變遷。</p>
<p>紡建配紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡調會聯合配紗，共配七七八件，全部配予廠商，申購單共二六七張。</p>
<p>現棉轉挺</p>
<p>昨日現棉因棉紗止跌回漲，市況好轉，人心又告振奮，市上買氣又濃，結果各檔較上日稍有軋升，午後做開送廠價，計靈賽二二二萬二二六萬，海提尖一八〇萬·又棧交價計靈寳二〇五萬，二一二萬二一三萬，二一五萬，二一七萬，彭德一九一萬，南太倉一七五萬，火機一七〇萬，周浦籽花三十萬零五千元。</p>
<h3>人造絲配售期　每月擬分為四次</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉中央信託局本年對日易貨到埠之人造絲，前後已達六千餘箱。故對八九十三個月中之配售量，已無問題。聞此後每月擬分四週配售，每月配售二千箱。該局已定於下週開會商討配售辦法，下週四可望恢復配售。配價將視下週一市况如何而後定，聞可能之調整價，每箱約在一千六百萬元左右。配售對象，將包括新設之絲織廠。又對原有配額，亦將考慮調整增加云。</p>
<h3>米市波動尚少　高粳秈店胃略動</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千石左右，市况起伏不定，惟彼動尙少，各產區新秈相繼登塲，恐難向榮。粳秈米高貨店胃有動，微升三五千元，中次平平，白元仍少上落。</p>
<p>麵粉廠方未開，零化略動，先疲後堅，結果軋升二三千元。統粉亦加二千元，惟廠粉較活，而雜牌粉則依然平正。麩皮仍趨呆疲之格，豆餅實銷甚懈，豆價逐跌，人心不振，形成明平暗疲之狀。黃豆江河日下，存到兩豐，去化呆木。陳豆再跌三五千元，新豆猛跌萬餘元，植物油廠午時辦進乍豆二三千包。</p>
<p>荼豆去化平淡，中次續跌三五千元，蠶豆一蹶不振，供多求少，步削三四千元。紅糧微升微降、見挺一二千元。苞米濟價回跌，酒精廠不動，北洋停辦，狂跌萬元。生仁平平，芝蔴軟化。</p>
<p>油市跌勢稍定，豆油先疲後定，無甚榮厚。淸油平定之格，菜油暫乏軒輊，生油早市續呆，收盤甬帮問津，轉成挺秀，軋升萬元。</p>
<h3>麵粉工業公會　再請批准買貸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四區麵粉工業同業公會，以當局對該會前呈小麥貸款專案，遲遲迄未批覆。茲以新麥登塲已民兩月，收購時期不過三四閱月，今已過半，不能再予延誤？廿四日特再函呈四聯總處理事會，請對前呈麥貸原案，迅賜批准，茲摘誌兩要點如次：</p>
<p>「（略）大處遲遲不賜批准，雖或具有原因、然時機不容稍待，亟宜即今把握，以　廠商雲霓之望。屬會曾因外間誤傳，屬會會員內已有若干廠，獲得貸款。當經查悉，僅糧食部委託上海福新，阜豐，華豐，茂新裕通五廠收購小麥，並代加工製粉，絕非小麥貸款，與前呈麥貸原案，絕然無涉。茲特聲明，並再呼籲此應請大處迅賜批准該案者一。</p>
<p>又據報載，大處正在擬訂實物貸款方案，屬會會員，深恐大處或將以麥貸一案，併案辦理。咸謂本年收麥時斯，祇餘兩月，至爲急迫。如待實物貸款方案實施，則前呈麥貸一案，恐於實行之日，即爲無麥可購之時。廠商等對於實物貸款，原則自當悉力運循。惟思爭取實物，應先一着，宜由大處先予原麥貸款，俾獲將各地原麥，悉數購貯。一旦實物貸款方案實施，自收事半功倍之效。否則，廠商事先絕無粒麥之存貯，即欲遵循實物貸款方案，亦必束手無策，此應請大處迅賜批准該案者二云云。」</p>
<h3>華南進出口商　向經會呼籲三點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：華南進出口商，近曾假香港華僑總會，迭次舉行會議，對華南新貿易管制辦法，詳細交換意見。最後決議電呈行政院，全國經秀會，及全國商聯會等呼籲，要求三點：</p>
<p>（一）求放寬輸入限額。（二）准許商人對自備外匯，得以結付進口貨物。（三）要求恢復輸入廣州貨物，仍能予以轉口之便利。</p>
<p>查三點要求中，各商對最後一點，尤感迫切需要。緣自本年七月一日起，輸管會禁止華南轉口貿易後，各商營業一落千丈。英美進出口商，亦感對中國腹地之輸入貿易，業已陷於停頓狀態，故一致要求開放轉；貿易云、</p>
<h3>商業行莊國內匯兌　五個月來金額統計　四月份之入雪額為最鉅</h3>

<h3>「打虎御史」萬燦　談對日貿易不應開放</h3>
<p>— 本報記者俞振基</p>
<p>南京廿三日快訊</p>
<p>對日貿易應否開放問題，在國內的經濟界顯然有着兩種不同的看法，一派是比較寬火的，認爲我國關稅自主，對外貿易又採管理辦法，所以目前開放對日貿易，對我國不致有多大害處，另一派則認日本好像一隻出押的老虎，而我國則毫無準備，對日貿易開放後，勢將演成「工業日本，農業中國」的悲劇，因此主張在對日和約簽訂前，停止考慮開放對日貿易，並終止派遣商務團赴日。</p>
<p>前一派的代表梵蕭錚黃元彬，及一部份政府及工商界人士，後一派的發言人則是監委萬燦，及上海工商界領袖吳蘊初吳伯翔等。而監委萬燦又是建議停止開放對日貿易的原提案人，他的意見當然特別値得重視、所以特地冒暑往訪。</p>
<p>萬燦這名字對上海人不應該很陌生，著名的金潮案，萬氏就是奉命赴滬調查的四監委之一，事後萬等曾提出洋洋數千言的彈劾害，彈劾宋等失職，一時有「打老虎御史」之稱。</p>
<p>危險的看法</p>
<p>萬氏一開口就很氣憤的說，「有人認開放對日貿易沒有什麼關係，這種看法實在太危險了。不錯，開放對日貿易，是麥帥總部的決策，但道決策是合乎日本人口味的，亦是日本所歡迎的，所以我們稱之爲日本人的決策亦無不可。日本利用僞裝的民主，博得麥帥歡心，再通過麥帥，來解決日本本身的問題，而讓中國成爲其工業品的尾闆，我們當然應該力予反對。」</p>
<p>「奇怪的是，我國政府對於對日貿易始終沒有一貫的政策，事事被動遷就，麥帥總部有什麼決定，我們就照樣辦理，奉命辦事，沒有一點自由意志，所以我們幾位監察委員不久前提出了一個緊急建議，除了主張暫停開放對日貿易外，並盼政府對於對日貿易能有一個通盤的計劃。另一方面，希望盟國亦應替我們打算打算。」</p>
<p>對日的關係</p>
<p>有好些人認爲，目前的中日貿易，是國與國之間的「正常貿易」，因爲這于關係就認開放是無所謂的，萬氏認爲這種看法是不對的，他指出所謂正常貿易，其主要目的在互遙有無，通商國的一方可自由選擇所需受的或不需受的。但目前中日兩國間決談不上正常貿易。第一，對日和約至今未簽訂，日本的賠償，我們尙未拿到，其次，我與日本間尙未建立正常外交關係，所以到現在爲止，我國與日本的關係，仍是戰勝國與戰敗國的關係，而不能與「正常關係」混為一談。我們經八年抗戰，勝利以後　念念不忘的是受解除日本的武裝，使他不能東山再起，這裏所指的武裝，包括政治的經濟的及軍事的。在政治上，我們不希望日本法西斯捲土重來破壞遠東安全，在經濟上，我們不希望日本擴張他的海外市塲，作爲他日再度侵略的準備，在軍事，我們不希望日本再能重準軍備。而要使日本的武裝「完全解除」最好的辦法就是與日本簽訂和約，並令他交出一切在軍事上經濟上作以用作侵略的物資，在此以前，適與日本恢復貿易，培養他的實力，這種做法無異養癰遺害，不但不智，而且是危險的舉動：</p>
<p>有利於日本</p>
<p>萬氏出任監委前，曾任中大文學院長等職，爲我國名經濟學家，據他從經濟觀點硏究，此時開放對日貿易，所利的只是日本，對我國可謂毫無好感可言。萬氏指出日本雖爲戰敗國，但其本土所遭戰禍極微，經濟上所受破壞微不足過、所以至今仍不失爲一「經濟大國」，而反觀我國則損失最重，本來極爲脆弱的經濟基礎，殆己破壞無餘，在這種情形下來談中日通商，結果一定造成「工業日本，農業中國」的惡果，我們希望的是「工業中國」，日本，我們雖不希望他成爲「農業日本」但至少是一個與「工業中國」相配合的日本：</p>
<p>好幾位經濟專家，不希望用「政治力量」爲「處理」或「協助」對外貿易的手段，萬氏大不以爲然，指出世界上幾乎那有一個國家不用「政治力量」推動對外貿易，甚至美國亦不能例外，我們爲什麼過作淸高，呌出這樣一個口號，尤其奇怪的是這口號竟應用到對日貿易上來，眞令人百索不解。</p>
<p>關稅的自主</p>
<p>記者詢問萬氏，「黃元彬先生曾說過，我們關稅已完全自主了，同時政府又採管理對外貿易政策，外國貨進口，其數量與種類是有限制的，因此，對於對日貿易開放問題，不必鰓鰓過慮，不知萬先生看法如何？」</p>
<p>萬氏反問一句：「不鉛，中國的關稅自主了，但稅率是不是自主，？我們的稅率大部份須經協商後才訂定，這種情形能說完全自主嗎？</p>
<p>「再說，關稅政策時代已經過去了，世界的潮流，都主張取消關稅壁壘！我們當不便違背時代潮流。」</p>
<p>為誰造機會</p>
<p>說到這裏，萬氏對於處理對日貿易問題的負責人大表不滿，他說：「中日通商假使是不要緊的，那不知道他們對此何以如此感覺興趣，假使是重要的，又不知他們又何以如此草率！」他認爲要這樣馬虎下去，將來只便利了那些「無組織能力，亦無建設性的私人貿易，」而更嚴重的是：對日貿易將便利了「有組織性，且有破壞性的官僚資本。」官僚資本對於利之所在就趨之若驚，日本有的是「自行車，手表，攝影機，」眞是他們發洋財的機會。</p>
<p>原則上堅持</p>
<p>最後，萬氏提出了幾個必須堅持的原則。</p>
<p>他認爲對日貿易問題。絕對該是一個「政治問題」，必須川政治方式協助。今日中國經濟如此凋敝，完全是因爲日本所給我們的「政治災禍」而起的「政治災禍」用「政治解決」是天公地道的，我們所受破壞，應該從日本那裏獲得補償，一方而使我們得以恢復，一方面又限制日本再度爬起。</p>
<p>其次就經濟上說，中國是一個有四萬萬買主的國家，非有供給四萬萬人需要的工業不可；所以中國非成爲一個工業國家不可，現在中國經濟尙不能「自成單位」，非於短期內使其達到自給自足不可，在此時期內，我們決不許可日本的商品再侵入到我們的市塲來，或奪去本來應該屬於本國的市塲，要達到這一點，政府對於整個對日貿易，應該有一個通盤的計劃，並且應該專設一個機構處致此事。</p>
<p>對於南洋市塲的爭取，萬氏亦提出了他的一種看法。他說，在職前，南洋的零售商都是中國人，而零售商所賣的都是日本貨。這一方面固由於我國工業不發達，但主要原因實爲我國政治力量不够，不能協助推銷。現在日本雖是一個戰敗國，但其工業水準較之戰前，超過多多，所以在政治上，我們非力爭不可，我們應該設法取日本而代之。記得有一位美國人曾說過「遠東應該以中國爲其安定力量，在經濟上中國應該成爲這廣大的消費市塲的領導者」外人對我期望如此之殷，我們不應該讓人失望才對。</p>
<h3>梅花山下訪玳瑁</h3>
<p>— 本報記者濮德玠</p>
<p>南京廿二日快訊</p>
<p>「梅花山發現巨龜」，南京的晚報在二十一日刋出了一條驚人的消息。好大的烏　！怎麼曾在梅花山發現？又如何背上還長着兩個翅膀呢？爲一究眞象，冒着酷暑，我們走上了陵園大道。</p>
<p>巨龜！　有翅膀嗎</p>
<p>先到國父陵園管理委員會，承他們又領着我們到了梅花山下的陵園園林管理處，我們　到了「巨龜」，在一個直徑不到一丈的水門汀砌成的圓池里，淺淺的半池水，漂浮着塘里帶來的萍草，靜靜的臥着一個甲殼動物，黃褐色的背甲和小的圓桌面一樣大，同龜背一樣分作十三片主甲和二十五片周遭的小甲。沒有尾巴，四片生滿碎鱗的大鰭脚平平的舖展着，難怪有人說是長了翅膀。灰絲色的頭頸，樣子和巨蟒差不多，一大半時間是埋在水中。這是「玳瑁」，生長在海水里的動物，梅花山不過是牠的新居之地。</p>
<p>三玳瑁　來自西沙</p>
<p>今年四月下句，我國駐戍西沙羣島的國防軍，在羣島洋面上連續捕獲了三隻玳瑁。隨後由中　運輸艦把牠們裝在木籠里帶回北來，一隻頂大的在路上絕食死掉了，另一隻運往廣州，贈送給廣東省府，還有一隻便在台灣換了美頌艦經滬晋了京，在七月二十日由海軍總司令部派了一部卡車，八個力伕，備文送到了陵園管委會。這一件禮物可使受禮者發了愁，第一，沒有豢養動物的設備，第二，沒有對玳瑁生活的理解，如何能把牠養得活呢？</p>
<p>伙食費　難於負擔</p>
<p>陸園管委會趕緊向海　請教，並把牠先放到園林管理處農塲的水池里，凋了鹽水浸濡着牠，並預備了小的魚蝦和果子來餵養牠。</p>
<p>海總的答覆來了，要給牠作一個池塘，底上舖了沙，擺幾塊石頭，用人造海水和蝦介小魚來養活牠。陵園管委會一算，這筆費用眞不算小，作池塘不算，就伙食一項計算一下，也就吃不消。管委會在考慮，如果負担不起牠的伙食費，預備請牠到上海或靑島等地動物園去做「寓公」</p>
<p>進木籠　寧願絕食</p>
<p>玳瑁的性情是是非常强暴的，在淺淺的水池里，浮力不够，牠一動也不能動，兩個眼睛凸凸的鼻孔淹在水里，不是氣的吐泡，冷不防牠用兩隻前　撲撲刺剌的打擊一陣，濺得水花四射，發上一次脾氣。據說這隻玳瑁從裝了木籠起，就不曾吃過東西，海總和陵園管委會都在爲牠的建康關心，怕　的絕食引起不幸的後果。梅花山不是玳瑁的安身地，生長在浩浩滔天的大海里的，豈甘淪落在不滿方丈的泥潭里？（附圖：兪培靑攝）</p>
<h3>中英航穿協定</h3>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>中英航空協定，已於本月廿三日在外交部簽訂。英國民航代表團，由包爾德溫爵士率領來華，商訂中英航空協定，經三越月之商討，已經獲得結果。去年十二月，中美航空協定先成立，開始將中國航空事業，引上國際之路。此次英國政府在合作的原則下，又助中國航空事業，向南洋和歐洲展開。我國抗戰八年，一切復員建設工作，千頭萬緒，尤其在材料和技術方面，很需要國際的協助。航空方面，雖積極進行，增加班次，開闢航綫，但因種種限制，未達理想程度。今美英兩國，導引我國航空向國外推展，造成了我國空運的一番新局而。</p>
<p>中英航空協定，規定有效期間爲四年，期內任何一方得隨時通知對方，於一年後廢止之，此點規定，與中美航空協定相同。</p>
<p>航運站</p>
<p>在我國境內者，指定天津，上海，廣州，昆明四處：在英國及其屬地內者，有倫敦，布列司威克，新加坡，亞庇，拉布安，古晋，檳榔嶼，香港等八處。航綫雙方均規定七條。遠程航綫，我國分東西兩綫，一為飛越美洲而抵達英國，一爲經印度，北非，歐陸而抵達英國。英國兩綫均經歐洲、非洲而至中國。其餘則以南洋各地爲起點。</p>
<p>國外航空，在我國爲爭取國際地位，兼以便利海外僑胞之經濟活動。南洋爲我國僑胞薈萃之區，南洋經濟，本以僑胞爲主體，對於祖國的影響也很大，以此我國經營國外航綫，初步應以南洋爲主，俾得協助僑胞經濟之發展，此次中英航空協定中所規定英方之航運站，八處中有六處均在南洋華僑集中之地區。七條航綫中，有五條可以溝通中國與南洋間之交通。此足以表示政府對於南洋之重視。</p>
<p>港滬綫</p>
<p>經商營問題，在爭之過程中言略有。談議英方要求亨受同等權利，而我國則認爲英機應注重遠程國際運輸，可以不必經營此綫。蓋香港地位特殊，且其機塲設置於租借地區之九龍。玲國爲維護民航起見，似不便同意。但英方對於此點，爭持甚烈。經多次硏討後，悉英方將用水上飛機，飛航上海，我國乃暫亦許可，惟運輸量則加以限制，規定每星期往返不得超過一百座位，一年以後，如欲增加，須先取得雙方同意。此項辦法，即由有關係之中英航空公司交換文件，以資信守。（其他方面，請參閱廿四日本報第二版。）</p>
<p>在事前，大家對於中英航空協定，懷疑英國在遠東有何野心。但從協定上</p>
<p>各條欵</p>
<p>看來，中英間非常能合作，即就航運站來說：英方在我境內，享有載運　者僅四處，我國在英境及其屬地內取得載運權者有八處，較英方多出一倍。航綫雙方均規定七條，我國並未少於英方，而且大多在南洋方而，直接予僑胞以莫大便利，間接亦對我國有利。至若水上機上之修建，緊急降落站之設置，則對於航行之安全，必不可少，而在主權方面，亦並無損失。</p>
<p>我國空運事業，逐漸向國外拓展，爭取國際上的地位，己透露出很好的遠景。空中運輸旣發展，航空器材也必隨之而增加其需要，希望我國的航空工程，能配合一切建設富業的需要，漸漸發展，便我國航空事業突飛猛晋，一日千里。</p>

<h3>啓蒙老師</h3>
<p>— 皇甫苔雲</p>
<p>時間之流本來就不曾停止，祗是在平坦的河床上，它顯給我們以表面的平靜，但是在高低懸殊的峽邊，它的變幻與激湍却呌人懾服。</p>
<p>二月天的一個下午，天氣暖烘烘的已彷彿如初夏。在大街的三叉口上的一片舊書舖子裏，我看到一個瘦長的穿着一條灰黑色的棉袍的中年人。他好像趕塲似的，很用着一點力向裏面擠，嘴裏謙遜的輕輕地嚷着：「請讓請讓」。他這樣的擠到書店老闆的一張紅漆的桌子前面，把抉在腋下的一大堆綫裝書疊放在桌子上，然後跟矮個子的闊臉蛋店老闆交談起來，大約不到十分鐘的光景，他空着手重新擠出來。這時我瞥見一張熟悉的面貌：禿頂，高顴骨，尖下巴短短的口髭上面的是一條拱形鼻子。他陰黯的臉色比進去時似平明朗了些，然而依舊是冷漠的。我覺得應該向他打招呼——運再不會錯了，他是我幼年的啓蒙老師。</p>
<p>『陳先生，您也在這裏嗎？』我說。</p>
<p>他抓着頭向我注凝着，臉上微現出驚悚又慚愧的神情，慢慢的說：「哦，我記不起來了，你是誰喲？」</p>
<p>我不奇怪他的驚異（這原是意料中的）向他解釋：「我呌榮　，就是您光生在A鎭坐館時，住在那新房子隔壁那家藥店裏的。」</p>
<p>「喚！」他把這胖音拉得很長，企圖掩飾他的侷促：『你那時是讀五言唐詩的的？時代是變得多麼伙喲！」</p>
<p>「是啦，是啦，」我順他說，其實我從沒有讀過五言唐時。</p>
<p>隨後我覺得應該問問他怎樣到這裏來的情形，幹着怎樣的差司？是否還吃着那行飯？</p>
<p>「我自己也不知道，怎麼一走，走到這裏來了，』從冷淡的臉上顯出苦澀的笑影說：「完全像隻啄木鳥那樣東飄西蕩，走過許多地方，接觸到無數的人與事；可是我一點也記不起它們，你說差司嗎？我說不出一種來，以前的猢猻王，自離開那裏就不再做了。」</p>
<p>他收斂了僅有一絲微笑，臉色變得更陰沉。顯然的，過去的生活對他是生疏而不快的。假如要他說出來，徒然勾起他一連串的，掙扎，沮喪，頹廢，流連顚沛的回憶。</p>
<p>我悟到自己已把他引進苦悶的圈子裏，所以趕緊撇開原來的話題，問起他的住址。</p>
<p>經過略略的猶豫，他在一張小紙頭上抄給我他的暫時寓所的地址——這是一家不大的宿夜店</p>
<p>以後他走了，匆匆的擠過熱鬧的街，轉進一條小巷裏去了。</p>
<p>我回頭走到店老闆那裏。他正一心一意的翻動那一准被書虫蛀蝕過的紙色變黃的古版絞裝書，頁中每個句讀邊都打着一個玲琍的朱紅小圓圈，書的空白處，塡　一些詮釋。這些對我也是熟悉的，好像我身上的裝飾。實在，我不忍心讓它們丟在這舖子裏，將來被不知名的人把它們帶走</p>
<p>跟店老闆經過一番交涉，終於化了一萬二千元買了那部書，我預備帶着它去訪問我的啓蒙老</p>
<p>第二大，我扶着這部古版書，依照他給我的地址去找他。但是我撲了空。從黝暗的客棧裏出來一個　朴的中年婦人，她平直的回答我；在建的店裏有過這樣一位客人，然而昨天已經走</p>
<p>我　　的心裏單着不可揭去的愁霧，他，陳先生，已傳染給我從前所沒有的東西，而它是那　容易使人　覺到心沉重，蒼老</p>
<p>「時代是變的多快啊：」我黯然了。</p>
<p>在我七歲那年頭上，一位姓范的鄉下大財主在我家隔壁一塊空地上蓋起一幢高大的樓房。廳棋將落成的時候，那位財主決定在這裏開設一個私塾館。當時學校雖然已創辦了好幾年，可是私塾館依據習俗與傳統，還是被認爲授學的正當塲所。所以父親立即把我送到那裏去。</p>
<p>拜過了孔夫子，父親指着那身材瘦長的拱鼻子棗核臉的陳先生說：「下跪，拜先生」。我照樣的做了。這時早我而來的，已有二三十個年齡大致相等的孩子</p>
<p>後織我又漸漸知道陳先生還是爲人們超度已靈的張天師爲門徒。不過他除了涂一些鎭鬼壓神的符籙而外，還能讀一些經書，所以，因此在當時早就把「敎書」的路打通了。在當他爲人家去做法事去的時候，我們就有一天或數天的假期。</p>
<p>那時，我讀的是「三字經」早上自動的把書拿到陳先生的靠近樓窗的桌邊。陳先生拿起濡紅了朱墨的筆，讀一句加一個圈，我便跟他唸一句。讀完了四行再反覆的讀兩遍。以後就是自己的工作。用功的或者帶　氣的孩子整天裏唸着這幾句書，區唸得稀焦爛熟；午後描一張「上大人」繳上去。這樣紙要到傍晚能够在光生面前，背過身，蕩呀蕩的，把今天的課如數的背給先生聽就完事了。假如背不出，那末磨磨手，挨幾下結實的手心也能過去的』</p>
<p>在那裏，我僅不過讀了一年，可是足足的逃了半年的課；所以我說不出陳先生給了我多少裨益。祗單單在他嚴峻的不鬆懈的監視下，生吞活剝的把「性相近，習相遠」的淺鮮的却深奧的，包含着儒家哲理的句子，生吞活剝的　進記憶裏去。</p>
<p>過了年，父親把我送到街顯的一座小學裏去。自後，在曉曉板，滑梯，鞦韆架上，早已忘記了私塾館是否繼續開着，那位道士先生是否依舊如古石像般冷淡的坐在那白木的新樓上，一邊替孩子們的課本打圓圈，一邊在自己的古版經書上加圈添註了。</p>
<p>島國人來了以後，全A鎭燒個精光，陳先生所寓居的純陽宮也沒有僥倖可言。祇有那間白木屋子　然獨存。可是那裏不再是私塾館，另有一個政治機關駐節在裏面。</p>
<p>時代已經變換了。收復後新建起來的A鎭，不再開設「私塾館」讓他來坐館，就是人家的法事，也很少有他的份。據說這樣，他便流落到異地去了。</p>
<p>時間的視野。在我們靑年人的眼睛裏是沒有的，不經人提起。我們確實幸運的暫避去這份人事上的感傷的重負——沒有準確的人生觀的如陳先生之流者，他就禁不起這人事上的變遷，而要慨嘆時代「變得可怕」了。</p>
<h3>煙蒂</h3>
<p>— 王黛</p>
<p>是誰遺棄了他的吻在背靜的道旁？</p>
<p>像一隻空酒瓶摔破在堅硬的石上！</p>

<p>事後的空虛反惹起他激憤的心緒。</p>
<p>那紅火依舊在殘餘的灰燼下燃燒，</p>
<p>像難閉的眼睛更蓋上一層濃鬰的睫毛。</p>
<p>蒂尾的唇痕彷彿依舊是微微的濕潤，</p>
<p>或許在不久更添上一道淡綠的霉紋。</p>

<h3>風景</h3>
<p>— 薛斯萊</p>
<p>（Aure　otsrty　1834-1899）是書人中最有財雷的一個。他本不是一個有志學畫的人，因爲接交了兩個畫友——雷諾阿和莫奈，於是才開始藝術生活的。</p>
<p>所作風景較多，受莫奈影響極大，筆觸活潑而帶古拙，色彩綺　而不俗氣，被稱爲印象派三大風景畫家之一。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>小城</h3>
<p>— 宋祝平</p>
<p>細雨迷濛中，我懷着悵惘的心情，喜愛獨自漫步在小城泥濘的街道上。</p>
<p>小城是那麼寒傖的：長滿靑荅將殘破的城牆，汚穢而狹窄的街道。道傍是兩列低矮黝黑的土房，土房外面早已顯的陳舊，古老，並”也將頹敗。牆上是一片一片剝落了的黃土。滴水簷被積年累月的風砂壓的快傾斜，輕遮着兩道終年發臭不見陽光的陰溝。天氣變幻，即使在六月也會有令人迷惑漫天的風砂。於是，這小城的一切，除掉幾顆綠色的白楊，便都披上一層土黃。早晚，街道都陂藍色的炊烟所充瀰。黃昏，小城的漠邊情調就更濃厚。在細雨纏綿時，小城的景色便又蒙上一層適度的凄迷。由這凄迷，使人感到空虛，寂寞，淸冷。也便體會到一個含蓄在內，不可言喻憂鬱的美。</p>
<p>同樣地，這小城的居民，仍是屬於那貧窮，也樂天安命的一羣。爲了生活，從淸晨到夜晚，整天毫無憂怨的忙碌着。他們也追求着一個最低度能忍耐的生活的安定。頻仍的災難，在他們貧血蒼白的臉上，僅是一串低聲的嘆息。小城雖然也征過兵，要過糧，可是，並沒有受到戰爭的威脅。因此小城還是有着濃郁的保守，靜謐的氣氛。人們永遠沉默着，平儿的讓苦難從嘆息中溜走，讓歲月在淡泊中消逝。他們似乎都沒有理想和希望，所有的消遺，僅不過是跑跑茶館，再不然街口擺一盤象棋，找根絃子唱幾齣本地戲，這斂財使他們感到滿足。昏黃的菜油燈照着他們生，也照着他們死，這平凡，却令人感到，生活平凡的認眞，而且嚴肅了。</p>
<p>終年被風砂侵蝕着的小城，也有過它一個時期的繁榮。可是，僅僅曇花一現，跟隨着繁榮之後是一切的不景氣，於是便沒落了，小城也就更形貧血，衰老。然而，人們並不習慣人海的波折，小城雨天的街道仍是那　泥濘，依然不失那份雨中凄迷的韻緻。</p>
<p>曾幾何時，我離開了小城文不得不重復歸來，小城仍舊保持着它的那份固有的情趣。細雨迷濛中，我懷着一顆創痛的心，又漫步在小城泥濘的街道上，黃昏，這小城街頭的凄迷，更易惹人傷感，也更惹人懷　了。朦朧中，我望見小城四圍的山頭上建築起碉堡，頹廢的城頭，屹立着持槍的哨兵。傍晚，稀疎的槍聲裏伴着教堂晚　的鐘聲，輕輕地劃破了小城快二十年的寗靜。小城却仍是和往常一樣，並沒有爲這驚心的槍聲而感到戰爭的殘酷，耗費，以及戰爭所帶來更多的不幸。（六月末，平凉。）</p>
<h3>黃昏</h3>
<p>— 質風</p>
<p>我玲惜着這一長串日子裏的每一個黃昏。</p>
<p>我們緩緩地踏着小步子，通過夾着垂楊的堤岸，披着一身灰色。然而，我們的心是明朗的，澎　的，我們時刻追蹤着，想攫取一些崇高的想像</p>
<p>我們折入一條墓道，靑靑的墓草，高高的墓木，這之間又抹上一道灰色的黃色，陰森森的我們彷彿可以看到好多個幽靈的影子。然而，我們的心是明朗的，澎湃的，我們想瞧到這些影子。</p>
<p>一堆堆靑家裏，遠在幾十年之前已竟變爲白骨了，但這些影子却從我們的想像裏活過來，我們彷彿看到他們揮着拳頭，暴着靑筋，倒下去，一陣痙攣，流出再後的一滴血……</p>
<p>她立定了，從蒼芒的灰色裏，我看到一個嚴肅的臉孔，從嚴肅的臉孔上，我應到了一顆虔誠的心。</p>
<p>我不能挽着她的　膀，我不該逗她歡笑，因爲從這些想像的影子裏，她發現了眞眞的自己，她已竟讓自己參進了這些影子的中心。她看到揮着拳頭的手，額上的青筯，倒下去的屍體，　出來的血……</p>
<p>我靜靜地諦聆着那顆虔誠的心底跳動，我默默地爲她祝福，爲她祈禱：從拳頭，靑筋，屍體，血的影子裏，發現到一些更崇高的形像。……</p>
<p>「但願這些形像永遠活在我們的心底！」她笑了，從銀鈴般的笑聲裏，我覺眼前不是灰色的黃昏，後面不是黝黑的夜，我想像着我們跨着矯健的步伐，在一個緋色的晨　裏。</p>
<p>『是的，讓這些形像安放在我們的行列的前面，讓他（她）們帶領着我們走向那個合理的行程和歸宿！」</p>
<p>她沉默了，從沉默裏，我覺觸到一種無聲的契合，我笑了。我覺得更年青，更壯健，更增强了生命的活力！……</p>
<p>我們緊緊地挽住了，我們數得淸那有節奏的心底跳動，我知道我們的想像匯成一道，尾隨着那些影子，趕着我們的行程……</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　358</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我笑了笑：「你紀姨必是有她的打算，咱們沒弄淸楚，可別得罪人家。呌紀姨不好辦事。一</p>
<p>「知道了，老伯，……」他也笑了笑，一邊又對我說，「您慢走，我先跑一步……」說着，小老虎早撒開腿跑下去了；沿着山徑，下到山　，閃，　到林子裏去了。</p>
<p>等我走到　邊，大　子早探頭探腦，從一間茅屋角轉了出來；大概是來迎接我的。可是他始終沒走渦來，好像害怕有人看見似的，只在茅屋邊上站住等着。</p>
<p>「秘書長！」他悄沒聲喊着，「一拐灣就到……可是紀小姐睡沉了，還沒醒來……」女說着，便轉身瞇着我，貼近茅屋邊走着。</p>
<p>北地不像南邊；　　　　　　　　一片陰暗，却並不潮濕。但這陰氣慘慘的氣氛，也很够凄凉。我想耀羣才二十幾歲，正在女子黃金的時代裏，就不跟那些江南警華世界裏的小姐們比較，也似乎不應該把大好的靑春，消耗在這荒凉的窮谷裏，並且時時刻刻冒着生命的危險，與一羣妖魔鬼狐鬥爭着。可是誰又呌她生在這個大時代　；誰又呌她　七捲入了這波濤　湧的最尖頂上呢？</p>
<p>「別驚動她！」進屋之前，我囑咐大傻子：「讓她多睡一會；我很可以　着，也正好休息……」</p>
<p>這也算一間屋子？一進門就有一股沙泥味鑽到鼻孔裏，屋頂那們低，一伸手就可探到屋頂椽子；四壁都是土牆，並且朝一邊傾斜着；大槪要不有幾個小樹擋住風雨，只一陣小暴、就可把頂揭去，把土牆冲坍。倒是也有一個裏外間，這分隔裏外間的一道牆壁，是北平高等大雜院舖地的草墊，用兩根木料撑着。這不用跟上海或北平的高樓大厦作比較，竟通長辛店的平房，也比這裏有天上地下的分別。</p>
<p>屋子裏倒是有兩張像小販攤案板似的小桌子，幾條破畏凳；就不見一隻床，而屋角舖着的兩堆麥草和高梁杆，大概就是床舖。惟一的光綫有兩條來路；除了大門射進的光亮之外，牆上還有一個不方不圓的小洞；其餘就是屋頂破洞漏進的微光；只把大門一闔上，怕要黑暗得如同地洞。</p>
<p>鼎元脫去了和尙外衣，穿的一套紫花色粗布褂　。倒是八成新；站在一邊對我點頭微笑、遞過手式，沒有開口，怕驚醒了耀羣。小老虎站在鼎元身後，對着一個土罐子口骨董骨董喝着水；那副爭像，好像怕人給他搶奪過去似的。</p>
<p>量减少皮靴行動的聲響；可是剛一　。就聽見耀羣打着呵欠；麥汗　窣窣，似乎人在翻身轉側。</p>

<h3>中國新聞之友</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>美國新聞處自八月一日起因經費驟减，除縮小全國工作地點外，幷將大量裁員，對於這個舉措，無論如何，是十分遺憾的。</p>
<p>我們對於美國新聞處，有一種親切之感，乃是這個機構在抗戰時期，曾經與我們新聞界「駢肩作戰」過，她曾經在各種物質那樣困難的環境當中，她經常供給貧乏的中國新聞界許多實際上的援助。</p>
<p>比如報導對敵作戰情形的一切新聞資料，敵我作戰的戰略地圖，戰時無法運用的膠板，這些都有助於中國戰時新聞界以及中國新聞紙的讀者的。抗戰勝利後，美國新聞處的工作不單擴大　且加深了，全國的辦事處也日益增加，這對於全國新聞界更得益匪淺，尤其是內地不能獲得外國通訊社電訊及專稿的新聞紙，美國新聞處的供獻，無疑地是獲得更大的歡迎。</p>
<p>但是，我們很奇怪，美國國務院却批駁了美國新聞處在中國辦公的經費，以致這個機構將入於半停頓狀態，無論如何，這是十分可以惋惜的事。</p>
<p>我們希望美國國務院能够着眼於全中國—尤其是各地小城市里的新聞紙，他們多麼需要美新聞處的助力。希望美國務院能够重新考慮，收回這個緊縮機構，减少經費的不智的決定。</p>
<p>如若可能的話，美國國務院可以徵詢中國新聞界的意見，一定可以獲得相同的答案的。</p>

<h3>阮慕韓之死</h3>
<p>— 白馬</p>
<p>七七事變北平淪陷日寇手不久，我在南京看到一條新聞，上載：大學教授阮慕韓率游擊隊數百人，自北平突圍與日寇戰於西山。自後，我便一直注視「阮慕韓」這個名字。</p>
<p>二十八年我在馬尼拉日本報上又看到一條新聞，上載：敵方游擊隊領袖阮慕韓，現已被我方逮捕，正嚴訊中。當時在想，恐怕他要成仁了。但他尙年輕，還希望他不致即死，對抗戰再多盡一番力量。三十一年我到重慶，得到他的消息，說他在將處決前，獄卒以他犯頂替，把他偸放了。三十四年日本投降，中共進佔察哈爾，他榮任察省高等法院院長，後轉任察省政府秘書長。至此，我纔知道他是一個中共黨員。去冬國軍收復察哈爾，他由張家口逃到下花園時，不知何故，中共當局竟下令把他就塊槍斃了！</p>
<p>他名銘琦，慕韓是他的字，察哈爾懷安縣柴溝堡人，現年約四十五六歲，身長約四尺六七寸，圓圓的面龐，頸短，限近視，雖架極高度眼鏡，看人也不甚淸楚，故在中學時，同學贈以「阮瞎子」綽號。他於柴溝堡高小畢業後，先考入宣化中學（前直隸省立第十六中學）一年後轉入通縣潞河中學。游河中學畢業後，東渡日本入東京慶應大學，習經濟。他參加共產黨，恐怕是在東京的時候。他在東京時，穿的學生服不僅陳舊，而且兩肘彎部分還有大窟窿。他本是富家子，家中有兩千多畝好田，何以如此不近人情，我當時很奇怪，現在想來，恐怕故意表示，他決非布爾喬爾，而是道地的普羅列塔里亞罷！他慶應大學畢業回國後，即在北平中法大學和天津法商學院任講師，並不怎樣得志，像是很寂寞的樣子。他住在西城自己的精緻小住宅內，妻和子均由柴溝堡接出來。</p>
<p>處在這個動亂世紀，一個人之被殺死，本來不算一回事，不過像阮慕幃這個人之死，却是値得硏究的。因爲第一，他是對馬克思主義極度信仰的人，他之參加共產黨決非像一般靑年盲從可比，應該是絕對矢忠於中共的，第二，他未死於日寇之手，未死於敵黨之手，而却死於他矢忠的中共之手。至此，我們不禁要問：中共何以要殺他呢？我以爲不外兩種原因：第一，毛澤東派與國際派鬥爭的結果，阮或許是國際派，故毛派趁機把他殺了。但這純憑臆測，毫無證據，而且有兩點：（一）他不北走蒙古，而偏南下北平；（二）不把家眷帶走，而留在國軍即刻到來的張垣，以此做佐證，可見前者推論之非是了。那麼，第二應該是對中共政策和作風整個不滿，企圖由張垣逃到北平自新。記得阮任中共察省府秘書長時，躱避在北平的察省耆紳喬某，曾秘密託人帶給阮一字條，問可否回張垣。阮當即吿帶字條人說：「不必回來，你們那邊成功也好。」從他這句話看來，他確是不滿中共，而把希望寄託到反對黨方面了。這種推斷，問問黃泉下的阮，應該獲得他的首肯罷！</p>
<p>以一個研究經濟學極端信仰馬克思主義而獻身中共十餘年的純潔前進靑年，何以忽然不滿起中共呢？這是要讓讀者去深思了。</p>
<h3>英蘇與新疆</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>自北塔山事件發生後，國民對新疆問題，已引起了特別的注意。對新疆的渦去及現狀，亦見了不少介紹的文字，未來新疆的發展與演變，與內蒙的綏察和東九省，證之最近各種傳聞，業已連成一氣，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>最先在新疆奠定基礎勢力的當推蘇聯，英人見蘇人勢力向東伸張，爲保持印度及西藏權益計，不得不竭力向新疆擴張勢力，以資對抗</p>
<p>蘇聯在帝俄時代，即一八八一年（光緒七年）中俄訂立聖彼得堡條約（伊犂歸還條約）後，新疆的伊犂·塔城·喀什噶爾·吐魯蕃·哈密·迪化·古城均設置領事，許可俄人在新疆免稅經商，這時新疆的實權，實際已操在俄人手中。</p>
<p>俄國革命後，宣言放棄在中國帝俄時代的特權，國人聽得非常歡喜。殊不知蘇聯利用在新疆各種的機關，利用新疆各種族的複雜，在伊犂·塔城·迪化各地，設立共黨宣傳機關及政治組織，從事新疆蘇維埃邇動，陰謀奪取新疆的政權。一九二八年（民國十七年）楊增新的刺殺樊耀南，一九三四年（民國二十三年）盛世才的擊敗馬仲英，可說幕後人蘇聯的得意之作。今日阿合買提江的反對麥斯武德，證之前例，其作風可說仍舊貫。</p>
<p>一八九六年（光緒二十二年）俄國與英國在倫敦訂立帕米爾條約，中國雖然抗議，英蘇置之不理。中國斷送了七帕（大帕米爾，小帕米爾，阿爾楚克帕米爾，薩電茲帕米爾，什庫珠克帕米爾，郎庫里帕米爾，瓦罕帕爾）。帕米爾爲要隘之地，爲中蘇英三國出入的門戶，英國之　，雖然不能奪取全部，但分得一率，亦足供其攻守以禦蘇聯。</p>
<p>一九三〇年（民國十九年），英國施泰英博士潛入新總，在天山附近發見油田，與喀什噶爾人私訂採掘契約，其後因中國抗議而撤回。一九三一年（民國二十年）英政府派陸軍武官施泰華德組織新疆探險隊，其交通工具，不特使用汽車，而且更用飛機，對新疆的政治·軍事·經濟作詳密的調查，同時製成極詳細的新疆地圖。吐魯蕃暴動時，英國退役軍官亦行加入，一九三四年（民國二十三年）一月，喀什噶爾的獨立過勁動，德姆拉為首領的回敎王國，樹立「中國土耳其斯坦政府」，雖然時僅半載，於馬仲英圍攻迪化失敗時解體。但英國在新疆的活動，在上項事實中可以明確。</p>
<p>盛世才統一新疆，喀什噶爾運動失敗，蘇聯勝利，英國退楊，蘇英抗爭亦可說達到結束階段。新疆的勢力，其後完全操於俄人之手。</p>
<h3>動物的敏感</h3>
<p>— 鄔性宏</p>
<p>假如人們遇到沒有鐘或錶的時候，憑着臆測來估計現在是幾時幾分，結果總有半小時或一刻鐘相差的錯誤，可是小動物蜜蜂却能很準確地估計時間。據英國科學家實騐，他們在距離蜂窠不遠的地方，每天按時放置餵蜜蜂的食物，那些蜜蜂必準時飛往取食，從來不遲到或早去幾分鐘，蜜蜂特殊的時間感覺力，由此可見。</p>
<p>某種蒼蠅有特殊敏銳的味覺，如果一杯液體的成份，僅合四萬份之一的糖，這種蒼蠅仍能嘗知甜味。比蒼蠅味覺更强的，尙有蝴蝶，若溶液中糖的成份祗佔三十萬份之一時，蝴蝶還能嘗知溶液中的甜味。</p>
<p>螟蛾的嗅覺能力極强，倘使你捉到了一隻雌蛾，放在窗口，稍候片刻，就會有一羣雄蛾自遠處飛來，滿停在窗口。因爲雄蛾聞到了雌蛾的氣味、乃尋踪而來。著名昆虫學家法布耳曾經用螟蛾來實騐，得知某種雄蛾能在一英里外噢知雌蛾的所在地。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>習慣的道德觀念，經不起較深刻的思索。</p>
<p>豬肉之成為人類的食物，乃是天經地議的事。推究其所以故，只是人類的一種生活而已。</p>
<p>庸俗的積習下的道德觀念，並沒有充分的理性作爲根據。人類！這被譽爲文明的生物，仍保存着若干獸性私欲的習慣，以及比野獸更可怕的偽善。</p>
<p>有人說，人類惟一比禽獸高明的地方，在予會笑，而笑的竟議卻是一個最不可解的謎；那「謎底」可能是極醜惡的，誰說人類一定比禽獸更爲高明？</p>
<p>我想，慈善家走過豬肉舖，並不會對那高懸的豬頭，發生什麼悲哀的感觸，理由是豬肉本來是人底食物。這種所謂「人底公理」究竟是不是真的合理呢？</p>
<p>如果人類的歷史，發展得更乾脆一點，那么面對著高懸的人頭，也不禁逗起同類的食指大動吧！</p>
<p>庸俗的道德律啊！眞的價値被蔑視了。</p>
<p>當納粹在歐洲耀武揚威的時候。或人間起德國和印度有什麼不同？一位有心人回答得好：「德國是千萬人在爲了一個人挨餓，而印度則是一個人爲了千萬人在挨餓。」</p>
<p>語短意長，如果眞理只有一個；我不知道牠是應該左袒獨夫呢？抑是站在千萬人的一方面？聰明的讀者自然比我知道得更爲眞切。</p>
<p>剛從德國歸來的C兄吿訢我，一個在德國民間流傳頗廣的新寓言：</p>
<p>一天，希特勒在馬路上看到三個小學生，他突然想舉行一次民意測騐。</p>
<p>「你說這次戰爭後，勝利屬於誰」？老希問。</p>
<p>「屬於英國！」一個學生眞率地回答。</p>
<p>老希皺了皺眉毛，又用同樣的問題詰難另一個學生。</p>
<p>「屬於美國」</p>
<p>老希生氣了，間最末一個學生說：「你的意思呢？」</p>
<p>末一個學生，舉起左手，拍着左胸說：「自然是屬於我們！」語氣非常堅決而且有力。　老希很高興地伸起大姆指來讚同他。可是，奇怪的是那個學生的左手，始終撫緊了左胸，老希發現了這特別的姿態後，很詫異地問：「你的手幹囑老停留在胸　？」</p>
<p>那學生的手離開了左前胸，原來那上面，淸淸楚楚地繡着猶太人的字樣。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>打電話的門檻</p>
<p>美國打電電話的規矩、和中國略有不同，你在上海借打　話，每次一千元，不論接通與否，而上海各酒樓旅館的電話以接不通的爲多，你打了一會，回說有人在打，你一千元還得要出，好比進電影院不會看到電影，門票還是要買，那是何等笑話奇談。美國就不是這樣了，市內電話每次五分，先將聽筒取下，把五分　幣放進電話機的孔中，然後撥號碼，如果換不通的話，將　簡掛上去，五分鎳撲托掉在出口處，仍舊是你的財產，電話公司不曾揩你的油。打長途電話需得知道門檻，如果你單吿訴她號碼，接綫生把綫接通，而對方未曾找到，你並沒有達到通話目的，但電話費還是要出的，你如果在吿訴她號碼時，加一句Person　to　porson　call，那末找不到對方，你不必出錢，因爲你的通話目的根本未　到，雖然電話局已經爲你服務過。你如果想打長途電話，却又不捨得化錢，你可以把付錢的責任推給對方，你祗消加說一句Collect電話公司便向對方收錢去了。我最怕這種刮皮朋友，有一次華盛頓派來一位紅人，他在另一個地方打長途電話給我，自己却又不願化錢，他學會門檻，呌電話局向我算賬，電話局的小姐眞可算妙絕人寰，她說有中國基人打電話給你，你　意不願意付錢呢，我考慮一下、區區七角五分還出得起，她然後把綫接通，那位先生却向華盛頓報銷飛機旅費長途電話費，可算是精刮絕頂，現款打長途電話是先打後付的，因爲接綫小姐無從預算時間，打究以後，她吿訴你一個數目，譬如說三元九角五分，你事先換來一大捧硬幣，你把六個半元投入電話機，再把三個二角五分的投進去再把二個一角的投進去，再把一個五分的投進去，一共是三元九角五分，接綫小姐完全憑耳力聽那角子下墜的聲音，你要是不老實把一分代　一角，　　也　從聽得淸　其　的分別。（二九）</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer and Others Flew to Shanghai This Morning; Will Return to Nanjing After a Two-Day Stay for Individual Consultations with Relevant Chinese Officials</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] General Wedemeyer and his entire entourage are scheduled to depart from Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 26th for Shanghai, where they will stay for two days. It is reported that after meeting with representatives from Chinese and American industrial and commercial groups in Shanghai, they will rush back to Nanjing to allow experts to begin individual consultations with relevant Chinese officials as soon as possible and carry out various planned tasks. Political advisor Mr. Sprouse will seek a general understanding of the political situation, hoping to find appropriate reforms and methods. Economic advisor Mr. Walker will study ways to strengthen Sino-American commercial relations and assess the conditions necessary for the development of China's resources. Engineering advisor Mr. Trechsel will work closely with the Ministry of Communications to review the completed plan for the new port of Tanggu and other road repair issues, which have already been drafted by Chinese engineers in cooperation with American advisors. Financial advisor Mr. Jenkins will address the difficult and momentous issue of how and when to reform China's currency system to stabilize finance and ease the financial burden. As for General Wedemeyer himself, it is feared that he will still focus on military affairs, planning how to cooperate with China's capable generals to complete the work of reorganizing and training the people's army, which was interrupted by the early end of VJ Day. This is to fundamentally eliminate the various problems caused by the heavy military expenditure burden.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] General Wedemeyer went to the embassy on Xikang Road from his residence on Shanghai Road at 9:00 AM on the 25th to continue holding meetings with his accompanying experts, embassy officials, and American army and navy generals in Nanjing to study various materials and reports. At 11:00 AM, Mr. Wedemeyer and Ambassador Stuart jointly paid respects to President Chiang and his wife with the delegation, formally introducing each expert. Afterwards, Mr. Wedemeyer and Ambassador Stuart had a long private talk with President Chiang before taking their leave. According to one of the delegation's advisors, the President and his wife were very happy during the meeting. Those who accompanied Mr. Wedemeyer and Ambassador Stuart to meet President Chiang this morning included Mr. Jenkins, the financial advisor of the delegation, Mr. Sprouse, the political advisor, Rear Admiral Trechsel, the engineering advisor, Mr. Walker, the economic advisor, Mr. Watson, the news advisor, Lieutenant Colonel Huggins, the general manager, and Captain Bauer, the deputy general manager. The group stayed at the official residence for about 20 minutes before taking their leave and returning. At noon, Mr. Wedemeyer and Ambassador Stuart had lunch together at the residence, and then went to the embassy in the afternoon to meet with Mr. Chang Kia-ngau, the president of the Central Bank, Mr. Chiang Meng-lin, advisor to the Executive Yuan, and General Fu Zuoyi, director of the Suiyuan-Chahar Pacification Headquarters. From 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM, Mr. Wedemeyer attended a cocktail party hosted by Ambassador Stuart. Those from the Chinese side who were invited to attend included Mr. Zhang Qun, Mr. Wang Shijie, Mr. Jiang Menglin, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Mr. Wei Daoming, Mr. Yu Hsueh-kuang, Mr. Zhu Jiahua, Mr. Li Zongren, Mr. Pan Chao-ying, Mr. Zhang Dongsun from the Democratic League, Mr. Huang Yanpei, Mr. Zhang Bojun, and Mr. Luo Longji, who rushed from Shanghai on the 25th to participate. There were a total of 35 guests at the meeting. The characteristics of this cocktail party were the small number of participants and the absence of female guests. Mr. Wedemeyer mingled among the guests and chatted cordially. The party ended at 7:00 PM. General Wedemeyer and Ambassador Stuart attended a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 8:00 PM. Mr. Ternor, the first secretary of the U.S. Embassy, and Mr. Walker, Mr. Sprouse, and Mr. Jenkins, advisors to General Wedemeyer, were also invited to attend. The chief officials of our government, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Mr. Shao Lizi, Mr. Chen Lifu, Mr. Chen Qitian, Mr. Weng Wenhao, Mr. Li Weiguo, Mr. Jiang Yuntian, Mr. Zhang Jiaao, Mr. Yu Bin, Mr. Zhu Shiming, Mr. Liu Shishun, and Mr. Ye Gongchao accompanied them. General Wedemeyer sat between Foreign Minister Wang and Mr. Shao Lizi, and Ambassador Stuart sat between Mr. Wu Tiecheng and Mr. Weng Wenhao. The banquet ended happily around 9:00 PM. Mr. Wedemeyer and his party are scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 26th and will stay for two days. The itinerary in Shanghai will be arranged by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai. The embassy revealed that Mr. Wedemeyer will accept the invitation of Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen. Mr. Watson, the news advisor, told reporters on the afternoon of the 25th that the special envoy and his party will issue a statement upon arriving in Shanghai on the morning of the 26th to explain the purpose of their visit to Shanghai, but it has not yet been drafted. As for the future actions of the special envoy, they will be decided after returning to Nanjing on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Nanjing Municipal Council plans to host a tea party to entertain General Wedemeyer. The motion was passed at the general meeting on the morning of the 25th. This was a temporary motion by Liu Shouying and others. The general meeting decided to determine the date after Mr. Wedemeyer agreed. The Nanjing Municipal Council is currently holding its third general meeting.</p>
<h3>Representatives from All Walks of Life in This City Prepare to Welcome Special Envoy Wedemeyer; Reception Cancelled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Special Envoy Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly to Shanghai this morning to hold consultations with leaders of Chinese and American industry and commerce in this city. It is expected that he will arrive at Jiangwan Airport at 9:45 AM. At that time, important Chinese and American figures, such as Mayor Wu, Chairman Pan, Director Fang, and U.S. Consul General Minister Davis, will personally go to the airport to greet him. Various circles in this city, such as the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Youth Corps, local associations, the National Foreign Relations Association, the China-Korea Cultural Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Women's Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the China Labor Association, the Shanghai Municipal Association, the China Post-War Reconstruction Promotion Association, the Youth Association, the Journalists Association, the Municipal Cultural Movement Committee, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, the Accountants Association, the Lawyers Association, the Shipping Association, the World Society, the Catholic Cultural Association, the Livelihood Improvement Society, and the Sports Association, the Bankers Association, the Money Trade Association, the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, and the Paper Industry Association, and more than 30 other organizations, will send three to five representatives to gather at the Municipal Council this morning and then go to the airport together to welcome him. Once Special Envoy Wedemeyer's plane lands, women representatives will present flowers to show their welcome and appreciation. Various circles in this city originally planned to hold a large-scale reception to entertain Special Envoy Wedemeyer, but because Special Envoy Wedemeyer's time in Shanghai is too short and he must concentrate all his efforts on official business, it has been decided to cancel it. According to Mr. Wang Zhuyi of the National Foreign Relations Association, the Foreign Relations Association will submit a detailed memorandum on the issues of China, Korea, and Dalian for Special Envoy Wedemeyer's reference.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] When Zhang Junli hosted reporters yesterday, he was asked about his thoughts on the suggestion that Zhang Aisun and others would propose to Wedemeyer to reopen peace talks. He replied that peace is desired by everyone, and he would also discuss this matter with Special Envoy Wedemeyer when he comes to Shanghai on the 26th. The government should further expand and reorganize, and the reorganization of local governments is no longer a problem. When asked whether the Marshall Plan could be implemented in the Far East, Mr. Zhang said that the implementation of the plan in the Far East is simpler than its implementation in Europe.</p>
<h3>American Personnel in Beiping Collect Investigative Data</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] It is learned that an American military attache went to the Beiping Command Post of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters today to inquire about the military deployment, troop numbers, and combat situation in the headquarters' jurisdiction. It is reported that he was collecting investigative data on the orders of Wedemeyer.

<h3>Sheng Ming of the Materials Supply Bureau: United Press Report Inaccurate</h3>
<p>The U.S. Has Not Delivered 500 Million Yuan Worth of Materials to Us</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Regarding the news about the remaining U.S. materials shipped to China, reported by the United Press Washington dispatch on July 22, as published in various newspapers in this city on the 24th, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan issued the following statement: The figures in the Washington dispatch may cause the general public to misunderstand the total value of the remaining materials China has obtained so far, and it is necessary to explain. According to the agreement of August 30, 1946, the estimated total amount (calculated at cost) of movable materials that the U.S. government intends to transfer to our country is 500 million U.S. dollars, of which only materials and equipment worth 170 million U.S. dollars have been declared as surplus materials. The entire amount of these materials may not be completely obtained by China, as this declaration may be hindered or withdrawn. Regarding the large-scale sale of 500 million yuan worth of movable materials, up to June 30, 1947, China actually obtained approximately 71 million U.S. dollars. As for the statement that the United States has transferred to China within nine months, or allocated to the surplus materials category, materials worth 500 million U.S. dollars according to cost value, this is an erroneous report. According to the agreement of August 30, 1946, the U.S. government still needs to transfer surplus materials worth 330 million U.S. dollars to China.</p>
<h3>The National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party Will Officially Open Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>A Prominent Economist Advocates Immediate Currency Reform; Believes This Move is the Key to Resolving the Current Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] A prominent economist close to the government solemnly pointed out to reporters on the 25th that currency reform is the main key that can be used to resolve the current economic crisis. Although this move cannot achieve a complete cure, if preparations are sufficient, considerations are thorough, and there is the courage to implement it resolutely, it is feasible to implement it now. He likened currency reform to a seriously ill patient seeking medical treatment. He said that the severity of our current economic situation is like a patient with a disease entering the critical stage. If we continue to avoid seeking medical treatment, we will surely die. Seeking medical treatment, although it may not necessarily bring a miraculous cure, is still better than dying without treatment.</p>
<p>Those who oppose immediate currency reform believe that currency reform must first meet the following three preconditions: (1) political stability, (2) balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure, (3) stable prices. He believes that this view is too idealistic and puts the cart before the horse. If the above three points have already been achieved, then why would we need currency reform? In terms of the current situation, since turmoil cannot be resolved by other methods in the short term, the only way is to suppress the rebellion. If the government can stabilize the currency value in a non-combat zone, then production and other aspects can be put back on track. At this time, suppressing the rebellion will also be extremely useful. If we must wait until the situation is clear before reforming the currency system, then the current situation is extremely obvious. A chaotic currency system will surely make investors and producers hesitate, and production will decline. Wouldn't the driving force for suppressing the rebellion be affected by this? Therefore, due to the instability of the situation, currency reform is even more needed.</p>
<p>In terms of balancing finances, the main source of financial revenue is taxation. Under the current situation of daily currency depreciation, the tax revenue collected last month is used for national treasury expenditures this month, and its value has been reduced by half. How can national income be increased and how can the budget be balanced? Only with a stable currency value can revenue and expenditure be calculated and then balanced. This point should also be clarified.</p>
<p>He also cited various reasons to explain the positive effects that currency reform can have. He said that because the currency system cannot be reformed immediately and because the government has adopted a pegged exchange rate policy, overseas remittances are fleeing to Hong Kong one after another. Although there are methods such as anti-smuggling, smuggling still exists. At the same time, funds from Wuhan and other places are also flowing south, which is a great loss to the country. After currency reform, this phenomenon should no longer occur.</p>
<p>He pointed out that due to various reasons, currency reform is essential, and to reform, it is best to implement it immediately. If we continue to procrastinate, even by the end of this year, the danger will be unimaginable. By then, the losses that the country will incur due to not reforming the currency system will be much greater than the risks of reforming it now. The first requirement for currency reform is that the new currency should be linked to the U.S. dollar. Because our country's currency is one of the world's currencies, it cannot be separated from world relations. This link can have a stabilizing effect on the psychology of the people. In the future, those with floating funds will not have to rush to buy U.S. dollars or engage in speculation. According to his estimation, if we use our existing foreign exchange and gold, plus the funds remitted back by overseas Chinese, as the reserve for the new currency, and at the same time impose slight restrictions on foreign trade, based on last year's international trade balance, this number can be sustained for at least one year and more. If there is international support, it will be even less of a problem.</p>
<p>When asked how to deal with the existing legal tender after the new currency is issued, he replied that Russia used two currencies simultaneously at that time, which is also a method. When the new currency is first issued, a flexible exchange rate can be set between the new currency and the old currency, which can be adjusted according to the situation. At the same time, the issuance of the old currency will be stopped, and the old currency will be recovered with the new currency. Since the issuance of the new currency is open and the people have absolute faith in the new currency, the old currency will also be recovered in the shortest possible time. After currency reform, the government can implement small-scale production plans, and private production can also flourish with security. The national budget can also be gradually balanced with a stable currency value.</p>
<p>This economist, who did not want to reveal his name, also expressed his support for the currency reform section of the recent economic reform plan passed by the National Economic Commission. He pointed out that if the currency is not reformed, the economy can never be improved. At the same time, the plan states that "the government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the currency system." What is the so-called "appropriate time"? Currently, the price of goods in our country has increased by 50,000 times, and the price of some metal materials has increased by more than 100,000 times. This multiple is not found in any country in ancient or modern times. If we do not reform the currency system now, must we wait until the price of goods has increased by 200,000 times before reforming it? He also does not agree with the authorities' secrecy about currency reform, believing that except for the price of the new currency and the British exchange rate, everything else should be openly discussed.</p>
<p>His conclusion is that currency reform is not a "cure-all." After the reform, all economic problems will not be solved immediately, but the reform is ultimately better than no reform, and immediate reform is better than reforming it in the future. If the government can have the determination and consider the gains and losses in detail, then it is feasible to implement the reform at this time.</p>

<h3>The Executive Legal Regulations Review Committee Was Approved by the Executive Yuan Yesterday; National Administrative Bureaus' Headquarters Must Move to Nanjing Before the End of the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Ministry of the Interior, in preparation for the implementation of the Constitution, believes that the various articles listed in Chapter 10 of the Constitution concerning the powers of the central and local governments, which are inconsistent with the current laws and organizations, should be revised and determined to define the powers of the central and local governments. This matter is also related to the ongoing reorganization of local governments. After internal research and consultation with relevant ministries and commissions, the Ministry of the Interior drafted opinions and submitted them to the Executive Yuan, requesting the establishment of an Executive Legal Regulations Review Committee to hold regular meetings to study. This proposal was passed at the third temporary meeting of the Zhengzi on the 25th, and it was decided to establish an Executive Legal Regulations Review Committee, composed of several political affairs committee members, with the participation of relevant ministries and commissions, or inviting other experts to participate. The list of candidates has not yet been determined. The following are the points researched by the Ministry of the Interior on the implementation procedures of the various articles listed in Chapter 10 of the Constitution, which are intricately related and cannot be clearly divided: (1) Article 107: Matters legislated and implemented by the central government, which require the assistance of provinces and counties for implementation, such as the division of national tax, provincial tax, and county tax, should be analyzed. (2) Article 108: Matters legislated and implemented by the central government, or delegated to provinces and counties for implementation, which should be implemented by the central government, which should be delegated to provinces and counties for implementation, and in which stage of the implementation process should belong to the central government, which should belong to the province, and which should belong to the county. (3) Article 109: Matters legislated and implemented by the province, or delegated to the county for implementation, and Article 110: Matters legislated and implemented by the county, except for provincial and municipal administration, the remaining items are the same. In these same items, how should the part belonging to the province and the part belonging to the county be clearly divided.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] At the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 25th, a temporary motion was passed, stating that the headquarters (bureaus) or subsequent management offices of national administrative bureaus that are still in Shanghai must move to Nanjing before the end of this year, and a plan for the relocation must be submitted for approval within one month.

<h3>At the Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Council, Yu Hongjun Reports on Finance; China's Import Surplus Gradually Improves</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun attended the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Council on the morning of the 25th and reported on the financial situation of the past two years.</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Finance has recently been managing financial issues. Since the victory two years ago, the government has been seeking peace every day, but peace has not yet been achieved. Therefore, people's minds are unsettled, society cannot be stable, and market panic and merchant speculation have spread in the gold market, causing price fluctuations and currency depreciation. These phenomena are mutually causal, and the Ministry of Finance has been dealing with them at all times. Since the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, we are planning to strictly implement frugality and increase revenue in order to stabilize the financial economy. The government believes that it can overcome difficulties. After the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures, general prices have stabilized and fallen, but this plan interferes with economic behavior with political power. Although it can be effective for a while, it cannot last for long. In order to seek long-term stability, it should be implemented in conjunction with peacetime measures.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of tax revenue, the only reasonable way to increase revenue is to increase taxes. The measures that have been taken are: 1. The collection of direct taxes in 1947. The audit process has aroused opposition from the Shanghai business community, which believes that the accounting personnel are corrupt and the procedures are cumbersome. It has now been decided to simplify the tax collection process so that it can proceed smoothly. 2. The special business tax has begun to be implemented, but the pacification areas are exempt from tax for one year. 3. The commodity tax rate was originally scheduled to be adjusted once every three months, but in order to increase revenue, it has been decided to adjust and increase it at any time according to the actual wholesale price. 4. Property tax. The Ministry of Finance previously drafted the "One-Time Property Tax" method. After discussion by the National Economic Commission, and in view of the fact that the collection of property tax in Germany and Belgium has failed, it was changed to "National Reconstruction Special Contribution." The Ministry of Finance has drafted specific measures for this, the main points of which are: 1. Individuals are the target. 2. Includes movable and immovable property. 3. Levied from 500 million yuan. 4. The procedure is: 1. Declaration, 2. Nomination, 3. County and municipal governments and local public opinion organizations form an investigation committee to investigate it. The central government will set up a supervision committee. 5. The central part is collected by the Direct Tax Bureau, and the local part is handled by the county and municipal governments. The tax revenue situation is as described above, but it still cannot achieve a balance of payments.</p>
<p>(3) Customs anti-smuggling. Smuggling is particularly rampant in the South China area. We are now setting up checkpoints on land and water and deploying patrol fleets to strengthen anti-smuggling and strictly prevent armed smuggling.</p>
<p>(4) Import and export trade situation. In the past year, China's total imports were 150.11 billion yuan, and total exports were 41.2 billion yuan, a ratio of approximately 4 to 1. From January to May of this year, total imports were 180.93 billion yuan, and total exports were 90.13 billion yuan. The import surplus for the past five months was 90.8 billion yuan. However, proportionally, exports accounted for one-third of imports from January to March, two-fifths in April, and four-fifths in May. The import surplus is gradually decreasing, and the situation has improved.</p>
<p>(5) Financial control measures. On the one hand, we are cracking down on unsound banks, and at the same time strengthening control. For urban financial institutions, we are providing effective supervision. On the one hand, we are tightening credit, but the Central Bank should still handle the allocation of legitimate funds and the granting of production loans.</p>
<p>(6) US loan issues. After Special Envoy Wedemeyer came to China, we provided various relevant information on the financial situation for research purposes. However, we should still seek a solution from the political aspect. If we have a solution in the political or military aspects, the United States may agree to the loan. After Yu's report, Senators Wu Zhaoxu and Xue Mingjian raised several oral inquiries: (1) The tax system is good, but the tax collectors are not good, so merchants use two sets of books, making the audit method ineffective. Therefore, the tax system should be reconsidered. (2) Is a 50,000 yuan banknote about to be issued? (3) How to balance the budget, etc. Yu replied briefly as follows: (1) Although the tax collectors are not good, they still need to be supervised, and please help from the North and assist in inspection. (2) To balance the budget and subsidize the difference, we still use issuance to remedy it. If we seek a solution by increasing tax revenue, the burden on the people will be too heavy. (3) Regarding the foreign exchange linkage system in North China, the National Economic Commission is studying it. (4) The issuance of a 50,000 yuan banknote is unfounded.</p>

<h3>Striving for an Active Role in the Peace Treaty with Japan; We Should Retain the Right of Veto; The Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Council Passes a Proposal; We Have Agreed to Convene a Preliminary Meeting on the Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] The Standing Committee of the Political Council held a regular meeting on the morning of the 25th, chaired by Jiang Yong. Jiang You</p>
<p>(A) Secretariat Report: (1) The Political Council previously planned to form a delegation to inspect and comfort the Northeast and Taiwan. The official department stated that it is not necessary to organize it for the time being. (2) The Civil Service Department sent a letter stating that the quota of Communist Party senators has been cancelled. It also reported that the senators who had previously been appointed officials or died have not been re-elected. Therefore, the seven vacant seats of Communist Party senators will not be filled. The secretariat has submitted a list to the National Government.</p>
<p>(B) Written Diplomatic Report: (1) The issue of the peace treaty with Japan is divided into two parts: one is the preliminary meeting to study the draft, and the other is the location of the peace conference. We have agreed to the former, and our government believes that the location of the peace conference should be held in Shanghai. (2) The negotiation process of the Sino-British air transport agreement. (3) We have agreed to the exchange of ambassadors between China and Burma. Then Finance Minister Yu Hongjun reported on finance and answered questions (Yu's report can be found on the first page).</p>
<p>The discussion of the proposals continued: (1) Please ask the government to postpone trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty with Japan. (2) It is proposed to ask the government to postpone opening trade with Japan. The above two proposals were discussed together and it was decided to submit them to the full review committee for discussion and then to the next meeting for approval. (3) Zheng Kuiyi et al. proposed "Please ask the government to retain the right of veto on the Japanese peace treaty in order to strive for an active role in the peace treaty, and to have this council participate in the organization of the delegation to the peace treaty with Japan in order to strengthen the diplomatic lineup." It was decided to submit it to the government for handling. (4) Xue Mingjian et al. proposed "It is proposed to ask the government to issue an order to all educational institutions to ensure that those engaged in educational undertakings at all levels can stay in their positions for a long time and enjoy their careers for life." It was decided to submit it to the government for reference. (5) Wu Chunwu proposed: "Eliminate feudal labor and implement democratic politics. Warlords should not be provincial governors." It was decided to submit it to the government for handling.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Proposal by Zheng Kuiyi et al.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] The proposal of Senator Zheng Kuiyi et al., which was passed by the Standing Committee of the Political Council today, states: "Please ask the government to retain the right of veto on the peace treaty with Japan in order to strive for an active role in the peace treaty, and to have this council participate in the organization of the delegation to the peace treaty with Japan in order to strengthen the diplomatic lineup." The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>"Our country was the first country to resist Japanese aggression. The eight-year war of resistance resulted in heavy losses. The peace treaty with Japan is not only to settle the past decades of Japanese aggression, but also to affect the rise and fall of the country's future and world peace. If the policies are wrong and the response is inappropriate, there will be endless disasters. Since the United States has been controlling Japan, its support has been obvious. This time, it invited the Far Eastern Allies to discuss the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, which has its own national policy. The interests of the countries concerned are different, and their policies are also different. The government is facing this important task entrusted by the people. It should gather ideas and benefit widely. The council should participate in the organization of the delegation to the peace treaty with Bai in order to strengthen the diplomatic lineup. At the same time, it must insist on the right of veto on the peace treaty in order to strive for an active role. Measures: (1) Please ask the government to retain the right of veto on the Japanese peace treaty as a condition for participating in the peace conference.

<h3>Before the Peace Treaty with Japan is Signed, Trade Should Be Postponed; Two Proposals by Senators are Combined for Review</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] Most senators do not agree with the opening of trade with Japan. The following two proposals were discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Council on the morning of the 25th: (1) Zheng Kuiyi, Jiang Yong, Peng Ge, Chen et al. proposed: "Please ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty with Japan." (2) Xue Mingjian et al. proposed: "It is proposed to ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan." The proposers explained in detail that once trade with Japan is opened, it will be tantamount to destroying our country's industry and commerce. The government should be immediately asked to consider postponing the opening. Senator Zhang Qianhua was opposed to this, believing that the opening of trade with Japan was announced by MacArthur, and we should respect MacArthur's proposal. In the end, it was decided to submit the two proposals to the full review committee for review and to the next meeting of the Standing Committee for discussion. The full review committee is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 26th. The contents of the two proposals are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Proposal by Zheng Kuiyi et al.</p>
<p>Zheng Kuiyi and two others proposed: Please ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>Reasons: Our country was forced to resist Japan for eight years. The people were displaced, and the villages were turned into ruins. Two years after the victory, the peace treaty with Japan, which the whole country is paying attention to, has not yet been signed, but the aggressor is already trying to expand and revive. Public opinion is confused, and people's minds are uneasy. At present, the government is busy suppressing the rebellion and lacks a clear attitude towards diplomacy. Although it wants to maintain the magnanimity of a great nation towards Japan, it should first sign the peace treaty and then open trade, and then help Japan embark on the road of democracy. All of these should be done in a normal and reasonable procedure. Unexpectedly, the commander of the Allied occupation, without first seeking the consent of the Allied countries, arbitrarily allowed the Japanese government to open foreign trade from August 15th of this year. Our industry, commerce, and public opinion have successively spoken out, appealing to the government to consider stopping the opening, but they have not been adopted. The news reported that the political meeting on the 22nd of this month expressed support for the principle of opening. This is a very important national policy. How can this council remain silent? (1) For the past two years, the Allied occupying authorities have been implementing US national policy and want to open up Japan's foreign trade in order to reduce the US burden of occupying Japan. The United States is a highly developed industrial country and is not worried about being affected by Japanese goods dumping. Our country's production is backward and cannot follow the United States step by step. It needs to have an independent and self-reliant trade policy with Japan that is different from that of the United States. (2) The Japanese government plans to export materials in the current year, mainly yarn, silk, raw silk, and rayon, in exchange for cotton, wool, and raw materials or products of heavy industry. It plans to import salt, soybeans, sugar, etc. from China, which will objectively put China's industry in a state of depression. (3) After the war, our country's industry is just budding. If Japanese goods are allowed to flood in and compete with American goods in the markets, then the finished products with Shanghai wages that are seven times higher than those of Japan will be seriously hit, and the market for domestic goods in the Nanyang Islands will disappear. (4) China and Japan are neighbors, and there is a principle of communication between them. The opening of trade is only a matter of time. In order to prepare for a rainy day, we should promptly invite representatives from industrial and commercial experts and people's organizations to widely solicit opinions and formulate a trade policy with Japan in order to strive for an active role.</p>
<p>Measures: (1) Please ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty. (2) Convene representatives from people's organizations and recruit industrial and commercial experts to formulate a trade plan in order to strive for an active role in trade with Japan.</p>
<p>Proposal by Xue Mingjian et al.</p>
<p>Xue Mingjian et al. proposed: It is proposed to ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan.</p>
<p>Reasons: (1) The peace treaty has not yet been signed, and compensation has not yet been fulfilled. Our country has no need to open trade with Japan in terms of law. (2) Japan has announced plans to export 500,000 US dollars more to our country in trade this year, continuing its economic aggression, which is self-evident. (3) All conditions for developing national industry are unfavorable. (4) The eight-year war of resistance, the bloodstains have not dried, and the pain is still there. Whether it is industry, commerce, or the entire people, there is absolutely no desire to trade with Japan in the shortest period of time. (5) Since the victory, Japanese goods have disappeared from the Chinese market and have no impact on people's lives, which shows that there is no value in considering trade with Japan.</p>
<p>Measures: In order to communicate with Japan, the method of bartering with Japan in the past can be improved or expanded. Once the compensation issue is resolved and the trade agreement is signed, trade with Japan will be opened.</p>
<h3>Five Supervisory Committee Members Decide to Make Another Proposal</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing on the 25th] The five Supervisory Committee members, Wan Can et al., believe that the government has not adopted their urgent motion to stop opening trade with Japan. They are now drafting another proposal to strengthen the reason for stopping opening trade with Japan. This proposal may be submitted within a few days.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Talks About MacArthur's Lack of Understanding of Japan</h3>
<p>The US Government and Public Are Too Optimistic</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhang Junli said at yesterday's press conference: In the peace conference with Japan, our country must demand the complete disarmament of Japan in order to guarantee peace. The so-called democratization of Japan is actually superficial and not thorough, just a drama used to fool the United States. MacArthur does not understand Japan enough, and the US government and the public are too optimistic about Japan. For example, the United States allows Japan to restore its industrial level in 1937, which is actually impossible because this level was originally based on imported raw materials.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the National Federation of Industries Petition to Various Agencies</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] The National Federation of Industries, in order to oppose the opening of trade with Japan, sent directors and supervisors Wu Yun Chu, Hu Bo Xiang, Tao Gui Lin, Tian He Xiang, etc. to various relevant agencies on the 25th to petition. Chen Qitian received them on behalf of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and stated that (1) the government will carefully plan and strictly limit trade with Japan; (2) the 64 merchants sent to Japan have a detailed classification, and their reputation in the business community is strictly reviewed; (3) the Ministry of Economic Affairs is willing to consider and accept the opinions raised by the representatives of the Industrial Association as much as possible. Li Tang received them on behalf of the Ministry of Finance and comforted the representatives, saying that they did not need to worry too much and that the government would have a solution. Liang Ying Zhi, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, received them on behalf of the Executive Yuan and discussed the opinions raised in detail with the representatives, promising to forward them to President Zhang.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Approves Loan to Help Japan Restore Coal Mines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur has approved a loan of 11.14 billion yen to 23 designated coal mining companies. These companies own 90% of the total coal mines in Japan. This loan is designated to be used to restore Japanese coal mines and expand equipment. Allied officials pointed out that this loan is intended to increase domestic coal mines in Japan as a starting point for economic recovery. It is expected that after the Japanese coal mining industry receives this loan, it can increase the current annual coal production of 14 million tons to 30 million tons by 1948. Among these 23 coal mines, Mitsui Mining Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Mining Co., Ltd. received the largest amount of loans. Mitsui received 363 million yen, and Mitsubishi received 263 million yen.</p>
<p>Allied Nations Will Allow Japan to Use Gold and Jewels</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned here today that the Allied Nations will, through the Far East Commission, advise MacArthur to use the country's gold and jewels to help its industrial recovery, in accordance with the policy of allowing Japan to resume private trade. This asset of Japan can be worth more than 150 million US dollars, enough to purchase foreign raw materials, so that factories that are now closed can be put into operation to meet the demand of foreign businessmen after the opening of private trade on August 15th. Although Japan's financial resources of gold and jewels are not enough to meet all of its industrial needs, they are also enough to quickly serve as initial funds for purchasing raw materials from abroad. This gold and jewels of Japan was originally designated for compensation. It may not be necessary to change the original intention, because MacArthur is ordered to sell it to obtain US dollars to pay for the raw materials, but it is also stipulated that Japan must find a way to redeem it for compensation when the countries concerned request distribution.</p>
<p>Allied Headquarters Plans to Set a Temporary Exchange Rate for the Yen As Soon As Possible</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] According to the Jiji News Agency, the Japanese Trade and Exchange Headquarters believes that setting a foreign exchange rate for the yen as soon as possible is beneficial to Japanese trade. Therefore, the Provisional Hall also hopes to set a rate in the near future. Although the exact number of the exchange rate is not yet known, it is believed that one US dollar will be approximately equal to 100 to 200 yen. The amount is set before the arrival of foreign businessmen so that Japan can achieve economic independence and the occupation work can succeed as soon as possible. However, it is not yet known whether foreign businessmen will be satisfied with this.</p>
<h3>Fifth International Statistical Conference Scheduled to be Held in Washington; We Have Appointed Chief and Deputy Representatives to Attend</h3>

<h3>The Soviet Union's Reply to the Issue of the Peace Conference with Japan Arrives in Washington; The United States Insists on the Original Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] A spokesman for the US State Department announced today that the Soviet Union's reply to the US proposal to hold an eleven-nation peace conference with Japan was telegraphed to Washington this morning by US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith. The spokesman said that the United States believes that the Soviet note is a counter-proposal, not a "complete rejection." The Soviet Union proposes that the foreign ministers of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union should first draft the peace treaty in accordance with the procedure for the German peace treaty. US officials said that the United States insists on an eleven-nation conference, but the United States may agree if other countries prefer to delay the conference date. The only replies that the State Department has announced to have received so far are from Britain, New Zealand, Australia, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. It is believed that the replies from other countries have also been sent to the State Department, but have not yet been announced.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Office, 25th] As the autumn harvest is approaching and the grain supply is sufficient, the Executive Yuan hereby announces the abolishment of the ban on grain exports, effective immediately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 25th] New grains from counties such as Xiaogan in Hubei have already entered the market, causing grain prices in Wuhan to fall.

<h3>Yellow River Rises in Shandong; Zhukou Faces Imminent Danger; Engineering Teams Brave Death to Rush Repairs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] The dikes on the south bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong are crucial to the lives and property of millions of people in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. This spring, after the National Army had just recovered the area, Kong Lingrong, director of the Shandong Dike Repair Department, personally led technicians and workers to the site for construction. The project was arduous, and the time was extremely pressing. They worked hard day and night to rush repairs. By mid-June, the most important dangerous areas of Zhukou and Dongzhuang and the soil work on the upper section of the dike had been rushed to completion. More than 40,000 laborers from the five counties of Heze, Puyang, Fanxian, Shou, and Yuncheng were being conscripted, and engineering teams and repair teams were dispatched to rush the soil work on the middle and lower sections of the dike and the dangers of Zhonggudui, Yangji, Lilou, and Wanglaoji. It was hoped that all repairs could be completed before the floodwaters rose. Unexpectedly, before the repairs were completed, communist bandits crossed the river on a large scale on June 30, harassing everywhere. The staff of the Shandong Dike Repair Department were the first to bear the brunt, with 45 members captured. The rest were forced to withdraw because the work could not continue. According to reports from personnel left behind underground, the river water continued to rise by 1.3 meters from the 1st to the 17th. Danger signs appeared at the 53rd and 2nd dams of Zhukou. On the 22nd, the Shandong Dike Repair Department dispatched a voluntary repair team to brave death and rush to protect them.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Ge Yunfang, chief engineer of the Shandong Dike Repair Department's western Shandong office, led a team of three engineering team leaders and more than 20 technicians, and they left Bian on a truck on the 23rd, arriving in Dongming that night.

<h3>Editorial: Facing China's Current Situation Head-On</h3>
<p>——Welcoming General Wedemeyer's Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>President Truman's special envoy, General Wedemeyer, has arrived in China with a team of experts. According to the published information, their purpose is to investigate the facts and make a correct assessment of the Chinese situation. This newspaper has already published an article welcoming the General's visit to the East. Now, as the General arrives in Shanghai, we would like to point out some aspects of China's current situation. We must first point out that the current Chinese situation is not simple and is the result of many years of evolution. Its current state has a historical background. Any assessment of the Chinese situation must correctly estimate this historical factor. Since the order to mobilize for the suppression of the rebellion was issued, China has returned to a wartime system. We have just achieved the victorious end of the war against Japan, and now we are engaged in another war. This was not the original expectation of the Chinese people. However, they feel that in the current situation, there is no other way to follow except to mobilize for the suppression of the rebellion and complete constitutional governance. After eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, what the Chinese people hoped for, and what the Chinese government spared no effort to seek through repeated concessions, was the restoration of peace and order, so that the people and the country could have a chance to breathe. However, the communist bandits fundamentally disregard the interests of the people and the nation. They are dividing and occupying territory, harming the country and the people. After much pain and reflection, the people of the whole country believe that if the communist bandits are not eliminated, the country will never have peace. At this time, we should use a spirit of decisiveness and courage to perform surgery on this malignant tumor that harms the country and the nation and remove it. The government yielded to the will of the people and issued the order to mobilize for the suppression of the rebellion. Now that the order to suppress the rebellion has been issued, the central focus of the joint efforts of the government and the people of the whole country in the future will be on suppressing the rebellion. This is the goal of all current efforts.</p>
<p>However, as mentioned earlier, the development of the Chinese situation to the current stage is the result of years of evolution and is not an accidental event. Politically, its development to the current stage is inextricably linked to the evolution of the international situation in recent years. In the political sphere, the development of the Chinese situation to the current stage is mainly due to China inheriting a legacy over which it had no will to express: Yalta. At a time when the Nazis were on the verge of collapse and Japan's fate was already sealed, the establishment of this "gentleman's agreement" caused the kind of situation that is now appearing in China. In order to accept this legacy over which it had not expressed its will, China made great concessions and signed a treaty with the Soviet Union with the feeling of a brave man cutting off his arm, reaffirming friendly relations. In the meantime, China's friend, the late President Roosevelt, also passed away, leaving President Truman to take on his unfinished business. It cannot be said that this is a major key to why the Chinese situation has the current state after the war.</p>
<p>President Truman took over the unfinished business of the late President Roosevelt and appointed Marshal Marshall as his special envoy to mediate in China. The Marshal, in his retirement, did not hesitate to travel thousands of miles to the East. The Chinese people expressed their high respect and heartfelt expectations. However, it is regrettable that the Marshal's efforts over the past year have failed to make the communist bandits, who harm the country and the people, abandon their views or make any concessions in order to restore domestic unity and peace. During Marshal Marshall's stay in China, the communist bandits launched a large-scale anti-American movement and openly slandered the government. Marshal Marshall was well aware of their actions. The failure of Marshal Marshall's year-long efforts in China also clearly shows that the Chinese situation is developing under the shadow of a larger international situation. Any effort to separate the Chinese situation from the world situation will not only be of no benefit to improving the Chinese situation, but can even be said to be harmful. We must view the Chinese situation from a correct angle in order to have a clear understanding of it and make a correct assessment of it.</p>
<p>In this situation, the Chinese government has implemented political reforms as much as possible within its power. The convening of the National Assembly and the drafting of the Constitution have laid a solid foundation for China's democratic constitutional government in the future. Even before party rule was implemented, the government voluntarily abolished the one-party rule system in order to express its determination to start anew with the people and return power to the people. Today's Chinese government includes three political parties and non-partisan social elites. The foundation of the government has been expanded. It can be said that the Chinese government has made its best efforts.</p>
<p>In terms of the economy, the current economic difficulties faced by China are inextricably linked to the evolution of the Chinese political situation. The existence of the communist bandits makes a thorough reform of the Chinese economy, including a thorough reform of the monetary system, impossible. Strictly speaking, unless this malignant tumor in the Chinese political situation is removed, all fundamental treatments will be ineffective. Taking the reform or reorganization of the monetary system as an example, our government has long been determined to do so. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan has also said that because of the communist bandits' rebellion, it is not yet time to reorganize or reform the monetary system. However, the government should do its best to save the current economic decline within its power. It cannot abandon this responsibility. This is why we see various economic controls, including controls on imports and exports. Since there are controls, there are restrictions on freedom. In this situation, restrictions on freedom are unavoidable. The implementation of control policies may cause inconvenience to American businessmen in China, in particular. They have just given up their "privileges," and now they are encountering wartime controls instead of peacetime freedom. It is understandable that those who are promoting Sino-American business relations feel this way. But we want to point out that the Chinese government does not believe that the current control measures cannot be modified at all. As long as the reasons are sufficient, we firmly believe that the Chinese government is ready to accept suggestions to revise them. As for the complexity and delay of procedures, and the occasional lack of dedication among civil servants, the government is also paying attention to them at all times and trying to improve them. China is currently in an extraordinary period, and we should have great patience.</p>
<p>In short, the current Chinese economic situation is inextricably linked to the political situation, and the development of the political situation to the current stage is related to the international situation. To thoroughly improve the Chinese economic situation, we must clarify the Chinese political situation. This is why the central focus of the joint efforts of the government and the people at present is on suppressing the rebellion and building the country. We must eliminate the chaos before we can talk about construction. As for the international situation, there is currently the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, which are of great benefit to clarifying the international situation. However, how the evolution of the international situation will be reflected in China depends on how our neighbors conduct themselves. Needless to say, what the Chinese people expect is that our wartime allies, our neighbors across the Pacific Ocean, can have a more obvious and active expression. This is not only related to the Chinese and Far Eastern situations, but also to the entire lasting peace of the world.</p>
<h3>A Primary School Student in Beiping Drowns in a Sewage Ditch; Father to Sue the Public Works Bureau for Negligence</h3>

<h3>Britain Agrees to Call Washington Conference to Discuss Increasing German Coal Production; Developments in the Conference Will Be Notified to France at Any Time</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Regarding the news from Washington that British Prime Minister Bevin will go to Washington in mid-August to discuss the issue of German industrial production with the United States, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office recently issued a statement saying that there are currently no plans regarding British Prime Minister Bevin's visit to the United States. It is understood that the United Kingdom, France and the United States will exchange views through diplomatic channels on the issue of German industry.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 24th] Officials here said on the evening of the 24th that Britain had agreed in principle to discuss ways to increase coal production in the Ruhr area at the Washington conference. A British delegation of three or four people is scheduled to leave England next week. It is generally believed that British authorities intend to discuss the entire economic situation in the Ruhr area, including its financial revival, but the U.S. refuses to discuss economic issues at this time.</p>
<p>News from London: The agenda of the meeting will be flexible, and at the same time, many issues similar to the Ruhr coal area will inevitably be raised. France has not been invited to attend this meeting, because the meeting is mainly to discuss issues related to the U.S.-British merged zone in Germany. At the same time, senior British government officials said that the British government is drafting a plan to convene a tripartite conference (including France) to discuss German industrial standards. But this meeting must be postponed until the entire German economy is merged. According to this, the Anglo-American agreement on the provisions for German industrial production will be postponed until the current Paris conference completes the work of the Marshall Plan, but the British government has to consider two points: (1) The German economy must play a substantial role in European recovery. (2) Britain cannot hesitate any longer on German economic recovery, because at present Britain has to spend a lot of money in the British military zone in Germany. The economic recovery of the whole of Europe must include Germany, which is Britain's consistent policy.</p>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Washington, 24th] After French Ambassador Bonnet exchanged general views with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Armor today, observers expect that the United Kingdom, the United States and France will be able to reach an agreement on a broad basis on the issue of German industry. Authorities said that the French ambassador's visit to Armor was a direct result of Secretary of State Marshall's assurance yesterday that the United Kingdom and the United States would not decide on a plan for German industrial standards before France had fully expressed its views. Also, a meeting on Ruhr coal production will be held in Washington soon. Although France will not participate, Marshall and Bevin have assured Bidault that France will be notified of the progress of the talks at any time.</p>

<h3>Peace Treaty Not Yet Concluded, Compensation Not Yet Determined; Shanghai Business Community Unanimously Advocates Delaying Discussion of Opening Trade with the Enemy, Japan; Avoid Repeating the Mistakes of Past Economic Aggression</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that the authorities in charge suspend consideration of "opening trade with Japan," stating that it was not yet the time to resume trade with Japan. The telegram stated: "Since the government authorities in charge have been proceeding with opening trade with Japan, the industrial circles in this city are extremely worried, fearing that after the opening, our fragile industry, which has not yet recovered, will inevitably suffer a major impact. This is the truth, and it is by no means alarmist. An examination of Japan's domestic industrial facilities reveals that the damage caused during the war is still evident, and the postwar recovery is also advancing rapidly. Although heavy industry is subject to control, light industry is generally free to develop. If it narrows its old advantages and makes a comeback, our country's fragile national industry will certainly not be its match. By the time the situation is irreversible and we want to impose control again, it may already be too late, and we will only have the feeling of regretting that we are wielding a weapon against ourselves. Therefore, for the sake of preserving the foundation of our country's industry, we should not lightly open trade with Japan, and even more so, we should use international laws to manage it. At present, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, and the state of war does not seem to have completely disappeared. If we talk about trade with Japan at this time, it is not a normal move. Therefore, before the peace treaty with Japan is concluded, that is, before the international relations between China and Japan have been restored, it does not seem appropriate to rush into trade. Secondly, Japan has ravaged our country for eight years, and the public and private losses are incalculable. Now that the compensation issue has not been resolved, and we rashly restore trade relations, we will also be coldly criticized by those in the know. Therefore, from the perspective of general international practice, our country should not lightly talk about trade with Japan at this time, and even other countries that used to declare war on Japan should not consider this before international relations return to normal.</p>
<p>Absolutely Not Still Harboring Enmity and Deliberately Discriminating</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation has always taken peace and mutual assistance as its guiding principle in dealing with international relations. We originally agreed to be friendly and mutually beneficial with neighboring countries. What has been stated above is absolutely not still harboring enmity and deliberately discriminating. It is actually based on the standpoint of domestic national industry or international relations. If, after the peace treaty with Japan is concluded and international relations return to normal, we carefully study concrete measures within the scope of economic needs and possible mutual assistance between civil industries, it would be appropriate to restore normal trade between the two countries. If it is said that the government needs Japanese equipment and raw materials and cannot afford to delay, then the current Central Trust Bureau is already handling procurement, so there is no need to wait for the opening of trade with Japan. Rather than adding more problems by opening trade and then imposing control, it is better to maintain the status quo for the time being and wait until the peace treaty is concluded and compensation is resolved before considering it. In short, the opening of trade with Japan will have a huge impact, and we must carefully consider matters and plan thoroughly to avoid repeating the mistakes of being subjected to economic aggression before the war. It is reasonable to send a telegram to request inspection and to order the competent authorities to suspend consideration of opening trade with Japan in order to set things right."</p>
<h3>National Products Factories Federation Sends Telegram Requesting Cessation of Consideration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factories Federation also sent a telegram yesterday requesting the central government to stop considering opening trade with Japan. The original telegram stated: "In order to preserve a line of life for the affiliated associations to preserve national products, and in order to safeguard the lives of thousands of workers, we hereby earnestly appeal to your Excellency to examine and verify, and to firmly advocate stopping consideration of opening trade with Japan before the peace treaty with Japan has been signed and the compensation for damages has been agreed upon, and to suspend sending commercial representatives to Japan, in order to set national policy and emphasize sovereignty."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Production Promotion Association Also Discusses Opposing the Opening</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association convened various industrial and commercial circles in the city in the conference room yesterday to discuss the issue of trade with Japan. As a result of the discussions, the following two points can be divided: (1) Oppose opening trade with Japan before the peace treaty is signed. (2) In order to adapt to the actual situation, it is intended to purely request the government to expand barter trade, so as to prevent the industrial and commercial circles of our country from heading towards extinction. At the same time, we will send telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to appeal for the cessation of consideration of opening up in order to protect our industry and commerce.</p>
<p>In addition, the National Shipping Federation and the Shanghai Shipping Commercial Guild will also convene a joint meeting of directors and supervisors this afternoon to seriously discuss this issue of trade with Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Are Skilled at Smuggling, and Future Leakage Will Be Huge; Hu Xiyuan of the Machinery Industry Association Expresses His Views</h3>
<p>According to Hu Xiyuan, a standing director of the Machinery Industry Association, it is too early to open trade with Japan before the peace treaty is concluded and compensation is determined. Moreover, what our country needs, such as rayon, fertilizer powder, and various machines, are not ordinary commodities and are also on the list of imports. Although there are regulatory agencies engaged in regulation, the Japanese have unique skills in smuggling. Assuming that the import regulations are 90 million, and the facts of smuggling must be several times this amount, and our country exports 40 million yuan, because the official exchange rate is too different from the black market, it is feared that it will be difficult to reach this amount. Comparing the inflows and outflows, the leakage will be huge. Therefore, before trade with Japan is opened, we must conduct a detailed review of the technical issues to ensure that there are no regrets. At the same time, our industrial circles must, with the assistance of the government, open up avenues so that they can compete with Japanese goods in the Nanyang market. This point is as important as the intrusion of Japanese goods and cannot be ignored.</p>

Subsequently, Director of Civil Affairs Zhang Xiaosong reported on the points to note for solicitations in each district, and announced the following eight solicitation methods:</p>
<p>Eight Solicitation Methods</p>
<p>(1) Solicitation targets: Each district in the city will organize a solicitation sub-committee, with the chairman of the district people's representative assembly and the district chief serving as the chairman and vice-chairman respectively. City councilors, party representatives, and representatives from farmers, workers, and women's groups will all serve as solicitation committee members. (2) Solicitation time: From July 27th to August 4th for each district in the urban area, and from July 27th to August 7th for each district in the suburban area. (3) Army appreciation coupons are divided into five denominations: 1 million yuan, 500,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan, totaling 12.8 billion yuan. The quota for each district will be specified in a separate table. (4) Solicitation should be conducted on the principle of voluntary participation, without using apportionment methods. It is hoped that each household will donate at least 10,000 yuan, and will generously donate according to the principle of "those who have money contribute money." Poor households will be exempt from solicitation. After each household has paid the donation, they should immediately exchange it for army appreciation coupons on the spot, and it is best to paste them on the door to identify them. (5) After the army appreciation coupons are stamped, they will all be sent to the city bank representative for issuance. The city bank will distribute them to the chairmen and vice-chairmen of each solicitation sub-committee according to the quota of each district. The sub-committees in each district should deposit the collected funds into the city bank's account #2324 in a timely manner. If there is no city bank organization nearby, it can be handed over to other banks for collection, but all army appreciation coupon stubs with district distinctions and all donations must be handed over to the city bank for accounting by the deadline, and all accounts must be settled before August 8th. (6) Individuals and groups who donate freely are requested to directly pay to the city bank or the district office's account #2324 and receive army appreciation coupons. Those who have already sent them to the municipal government or the municipal party headquarters will be forwarded to the city bank by the municipal government and party headquarters for issuing army appreciation coupons. (7) In order to prevent army appreciation coupons from circulating in the market, regardless of whether each household or individual pastes the army appreciation coupons or not, the solicitor must mark "Donated" on the coupon face on the spot. (8) These methods will be implemented after being approved by the conference. Then, Xie Chouji, director of the municipal party headquarters, supplemented the report on the various procedures of the conference's army appreciation coupon printing, supervision and printing, custody, issuance, solicitation, cancellation, and future distribution.</p>
<p>In addition, the propaganda department of the ten thousand yuan army appreciation conference preparation committee, in order to closely cooperate, decided to start broadcasting propaganda, and will ask leaders from all circles and representatives from all walks of life to broadcast on Shanghai Radio every day, so as to stimulate the enthusiasm of citizens to donate money to appreciate the army. It is reported that Mayor Wu has been scheduled to broadcast first tonight from 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Adjudication Committee Meeting Will Discuss Dismissal Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Labor-Management Adjudication Committee is scheduled to convene its 12th meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM this afternoon, with more than ten motions awaiting discussion. Among them, the dismissal method is the most important, and a debate is expected. According to sources, the dismissal method researched and submitted for discussion by the subcommittee stipulates that factory workers who violate factory rules can be dismissed by the factory first, and then reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. If dismissed for other reasons, the bureau should be notified for approval first. For companies and shops that dismiss employees, since there are too many shops in the city, it is not necessary to report to the bureau for record or approval, but rather the labor and management should negotiate on their own. If the negotiation fails, the Social Affairs Bureau should be requested for resolution.</p>
<h3>Barber Industry Dispute Over Revenue Sharing; Management Refuses to Accept Terms</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper] In front of the High Court Detention Center, a broad plaza, under the scorching sun, the families of traitors who came to deliver food and visit, the "young ladies and madams," were all complaining that they couldn't stand it. They requested the High Court Detention Center to allow them to build a shed next to the walkway. After the director agreed, the families of the traitors raised five to six million yuan and asked Xiao Jianqing, the editor-in-chief of the puppet Youth Pictorial and a "painter," to design the framework. Li Zulai, the "deputy manager of the business department of the puppet Bank of China," volunteered and rolled up his sleeves, acting as a carpenter and building the shed, with surprisingly "proficient skills."</p>
<p>Seeing Director Shan, he led reporters to inspect the back garden. Corn, tomatoes, grapes, and cabbages were all available. The past "high officials and noble people" are now carrying water and planting vegetables. It is said that everyone is happily competing to do it. In a corner of the garden, there are about two hundred chickens and ducks, and four large white pigs, with the "painter" Xiao Jianqing acting as the shepherd. Turning around, we saw several people sitting bare-chested next to the vegetable garden. Seeing us coming, they quickly put on their shirts and stood up. Oh! It turned out to be Sun Shaokang, the former "president of the Shanghai Local Court." Xiao Jianqing Raises Chickens and Pigs; Sun Shaokang Bare-Chested and Enjoying the Cool</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The wharves in the Huangpu River in the city were not dredged during the eight years of occupation, and the silt accumulation is very thick. The Shanghai Dredging Bureau began dredging wharves No. 1 to No. 9 in the southern city last winter, and is currently carrying out dredging work on wharves No. 10 to No. 12. The cost of this dredging is approximately over 1 billion yuan. The remaining wharves outside the southern city that need to be dredged are approximately 1.3 million cubic meters, and the total dredging cost is estimated to be around 8.2 billion yuan. Because there are no funds available, the Public Works Bureau's Wharf Warehouse Management Office has contacted shipping companies to handle the heat-related matters. All ships berthing at the wharves outside the Bund in the southern city, except for iron barges, small boats, tugboats, and ferries, will be charged an additional 20% of the berthing fee as a dredging surcharge.

<h3>Assassination of Qiu Lianhuan Case; Fourteen Suspects Indicted; Zhu Liansheng Unaware, Exempted from Discussion; Feng Renyi, etc. to be Handled Separately After Arrest</h3>
<p>The Indictment Details the Murder Process Vividly</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of Qiu Lianhuan, the inspector of the Gao Shiman Dance Hall, being assassinated in front of the Atlantic Western Restaurant, has been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Xu Ding of the District Prosecutor's Office after the suspects were sent to the prosecutor's office. According to the severity of the crimes, indictments and non-indictments were issued separately. Nine people, including Sheng Shugen, a jobless hooligan, Wei Xiaoyang, Ye Dongying, inspectors of Nanshi Theater, Li Desheng, a vendor, Chu Shutang, a coppersmith, Ye Liangjiang, a used clothing dealer, Mao Chenyun, a vendor, and Xiang Yinquan, a rickshaw puller, committed murder together and will be charged under Article 28 and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Four accomplices, including Ma Caide (aka Agou), a plasterer, Ma Wenkui (aka Sanba), a painter, Chuan Qifu, and Chen Fugen (aka Xiaodier), a coppersmith, will be charged under Article 30 and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Chen Yonggui, who harbored the criminals, will be charged under Article 164, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The public prosecutor has filed a public prosecution against the above fourteen suspects in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. As for Zhu Yunsheng's permission for Sheng Shugen to stay overnight, it was at Chen Yonggui's request, and Zhuan Yi was also unaware of the situation. The evidence of the crime is insufficient and will be exempted from discussion. Although Zhang Ruting is a jobless hooligan and has a long criminal record of theft, he was mistakenly implicated and will be dealt with separately without indictment. The fugitives, Feng Renyi, Bai Laili, Ajingen, Wang Aqiao, Yu Caigen, Shi Guoguang, Zhou Fuqing, and Li Bin, will be handled separately after being arrested. The case</p>
<p>Facts of the Case</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the victim, Qiu Lianhuan, had no permanent job and was idle. Later, he was employed as a dispatch member of the Central Bureau of Statistics and as an inspector of the Gao Shiman Dance Hall, and his influence became even greater. He usually relied on his strength to bully others, and many people resented him, resulting in numerous grievances. Especially with Sheng Shugen, Fu Qifu, and the fugitives Feng Renyi, Bai Laili, etc., the resentment was the deepest, and they had long harbored the intention of harming him. On May 30th of this year, Feng Renyi and Bai Laili separately summoned their followers, Mao Qingyun, Ajingen, Wang Aqiao, Yu Caigen, Wang Agou, Shi Guoguang, Zhou Fuqing, and other seven people, to room 16 of the Zhonghua Xin Hotel on Beijing Road to discuss the matter of harming Qiu Lianhuan. They also invited Sheng Shugen to join in advance. Sheng, considering his weakness, feared that he would not be up to the task. They further invited Ye Dongying, nicknamed "Southern Hercules," and Wei Xiaoyang, nicknamed "Eastern Hercules," as well as Rong Liangjiang, Chu Shurong, and many others whose names are unknown, to jointly implement the plan. That evening, Feng Renyi and others</p>
<p>Each Carried a Sharp Blade</p>
<p>From the Zhonghua Xin Hotel to the Gao Shiman Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road. Sheng Shugen and others also arrived at the dance hall by a roundabout route, all scattering and lingering at the entrance, intending to ambush Qiu outside and then jointly harm him. However, Qiu had already left earlier that night, so they missed him and returned without success. The next day, Bai Laili again invited his follower Xiang Yinquan to join, tempting him with rewards. Xiang gladly accepted the order and immediately went to the Zhonghua Xin Hotel to discuss the matter. After dinner, they purchased two more sharp knives for use and were still led by Feng Renyi and Bai Laili. The group arrived in front of the Central Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road around 10:00 PM to ambush Qiu. Sheng Shugen and others also arrived as scheduled and scattered along the road.</p>
<p>A Sudden Downpour</p>
<p>Around 10:30 PM, Qiu hurriedly walked out of the Atlantic Restaurant. Because he was walking very fast, they couldn't catch up. The plan again failed. All of them returned disappointed, and rescheduled for the next day to reconvene at the original location and seize the opportunity to implement the plan. The next day, June 1st, Sheng Shugen and others were very angry at the repeated failures. That afternoon, around 2:00 PM, Wei Xiaoyang invited Li Desheng and Li Bin, and Feng Renyi invited Bao Yongfa, Chen Fugen, Ma Caide, Ma Wenkui, etc. to assist, and several others whose names are unknown, first at the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall. Chen Fugen and Ma Wenkui ambushed at the Jincheng Navigation Agency, and used the telephone to coordinate temporarily. Around 8:00 PM that evening, Sheng Shugen and others went to Fuxing Garden for dinner, and then went to the front of the Atlantic Restaurant,</p>
<p>Scattering and Standing</p>
<p>Feng Bai also led Mao Xiang and the fugitives Li Bin, Chen Jingen, Wang Agou, Wang Aqiao, etc. to go by car. Around 11:00 PM, they estimated that Qiu Lianhuan would come out of the Atlantic Restaurant at this time. Ma Caide, Chen Fugen, Ma Wenkui, etc. notified the unknown persons in the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall by telephone. They gathered at once and agreed to have Feng Renyi and Sheng Shugen shout Qiu Lianhuan's name as a signal. A little later, Qiu did come out of the Atlantic at a slow pace, and Sheng immediately called out Qiu's name. Qiu heard the call and stepped back, looking back. Sheng immediately stepped forward and pulled out</p>
<p>A Concealed Sharp Blade</p>
<p>He fiercely slashed Qiu's right arm and other parts. Hua Yixun immediately hugged Qiu tightly and did not let go. Xiang, Li, Sheng, Mao, Chu, Chai, and other five or six people stepped forward and used their prepared knives and sticks to slash and beat Qiu. Qiu, in addition to being injured, struggled with his right hand and fired the prepared handgun to the left and right. Xiang Yinquan should have been hit in the waist, and Mao and the fugitive Yang Nannan helped him hire a rickshaw to send him to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. The rest of the crowd saw that the purpose had been achieved, and were startled by the gunfire. They all dispersed in a hubbub. A patrolling police officer discovered this and sent Qiu by car to Renji Hospital. He died of his injuries at 4:00 AM on the second day of the Western calendar. Mao Qingyun went to Xiang's house to inquire about the situation after the incident, and was captured by the police. Yang then</p>
<p>Escaped in the Meantime</p>
<p>Without a trace. Around 7:00 AM on the same morning, Sheng Shugen started from Chen Yonggui's house and was accompanied by Chen to Zhu Liansheng's house in Longhua to take refuge temporarily. The police bureau learned of this, and on the evening of the fourth day, Chen Yonggui and Sheng Shugen were arrested in succession. On the afternoon of the fifth day, the Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters arrested Li Desheng, Wei Xiaoyang, Ma Wenkui, and Ye Dongying's concubine Wang Aixiang, and handed them over to the police bureau. After Ye received the news, he turned himself in to the police bureau the next day and confessed the previous situation without concealment. He released Aixiang and led the arrest of Chai Liangjiang and Chu Shutang. At midnight on the eighth, Wei Xiaoyang's apprentice Zhang Ruting was also arrested. At 10:00 AM on the ninth, Ma Wenkui turned himself in to the police bureau. At 10:00 PM on the same afternoon, Chen Fugen was arrested again. At 11:00 AM on the twelfth, Chuan Qifu, who was arrested by the Coast Guard Group of the Port Affairs Committee, was sent to the police bureau. The police bureau sent all the above-mentioned criminals to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>

<h3>Four People Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Selling UNRRA Flour</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Flour from the UNRRA Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office was flowing into the black market in large quantities. After Deputy Inspector Czech Stroujie discovered this, he reported the suspects who stole and sold the flour, Lu Qibin, Liu Zhengxiang, Liu Baoyong, and Chen Yangzhou, to the police bureau for questioning. They were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday. The flour issued by the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office to the Tianyi Engineering Company, which contracted the project, was received by Lu Qibin. Through the hands of grain runner Liu Bao, it was sold to flour merchant Liu Zhengqun in the market. Around 3:00 PM on the 21st, 100 bags of flour printed with "UNRRA Relief Flour" were being loaded onto trucks at the entrance of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouse when Inspector Ji Gang of the office happened to see them. He stepped forward to inquire, and Liu Zhengxiang replied that he had purchased them for 228,000 yuan per bag. Ji believed that this flour should not be bought and sold privately, and reported it to Stroujie, who took Liu Zhengxiang and others to the Beizhan Police Sub-Bureau for questioning. According to Lu Qibin's confession at the police bureau, the flour had been sold eight or nine times. Because the flour was intended for the workers to eat, a portion of the surplus flour was sold to pay the workers' wages. Moreover, when Tianyi Engineering Company signed the contract with the Seawall Engineering Office in the past, it did not state that resale was prohibited. Liu Baoyong confessed that he sold a total of more than 4,000 bags of flour on behalf of Tianyi Engineering Company. On the 17th of this month, he sold 150 bags, with Dacheng, Senji, and Tongmao Flour Shops each buying 50 bags. After recording the confessions, the police bureau sent Lu Qibin, Liu Zhengxiang, Liu Baoyong, and the truck driver Chen Yangzhou to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution yesterday.</p>

Around 10:00 PM the night before, Wang and Wu each hid a fruit knife, planning to harm Shi. While passing Kulun Road and North Xizang Road, they saw Shi enjoying the cool air, so Wu grabbed him and Wang stabbed him four times in the back, shoulders, neck, and arms. The murderers fled towards Xizang Road. At the same time, Liu Delin, 18 years old, from Jiangdu, lives at No. 49, Yixingli, Changan Road, Zhabei.

<h3>Four Blind Men Involved in a Lawsuit; Feeling Their Way to Court</h3>
<p>[Not a report from our newspaper] Yesterday morning, there were four blind men involved in a lawsuit in the court. For a time, they were feeling around for ropes in the courtroom, which even caused the dignified judge to be unable to help but smile. The Shanghai Astrologers Mutual Aid Association was established to strengthen the mutual assistance of astrologers. The founders all worked hard to promote it everywhere. In May of this year, the plaintiffs Xue Yongming and Lou Dezhong, together with Yu Zhongxiang, the standing director of the association, went to No. 117 Dantu Road, Hongkou, to persuade fellow practitioners to join. They met the two defendants, Qian Zhongyang and Qian Shanhua. When the plaintiffs tried to persuade them to join, they not only ignored them but also hurled abuse at them. Neither side would give in. Qian Zhonghua even rushed out of the door, grabbed the two plaintiffs, and took out a small knife to stab Xue's left forehead and eyebrow. The police station then transferred the case to the court for trial. When the defendants were questioned in court, they cried out that they had been wronged, stating that the two plaintiffs had come to extort 60,000 yuan for membership fees, which led to the quarrel, and that there had been no stabbing. The court found that each side had its own version of events and needed further investigation, so the hearing was postponed.</p>

<h3>The Right to Approve or Reject Deferment or Exemption from Military Service is Absolutely Not Something that the Baojia Heads, Etc., Can Control</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, further clarified the following regarding the most common misunderstandings and abuses in the procedures for able-bodied men applying for deferment or exemption from military service:</p>
<p>It is reported that when able-bodied men in various districts submit their applications to the offices of the Baojia heads, the Baojia heads and Bao cadres, because the Baojia head must affix his seal on the application form, some Baojia heads, out of consideration for relationships, affix their seals without verifying the facts, while other Baojia heads deliberately make things difficult and refuse to affix their seals, creating the impression that the Baojia heads and Bao cadres have the power to approve or reject deferment or exemption from military service for able-bodied men. As a result, able-bodied men engage in scheming and bribery is rampant. In fact, the Baojia head is only responsible for providing truthful certification on the application form and has no power to approve or reject it. The application for deferment or exemption from military service for able-bodied men, after being sealed by the Baojia head for certification, is sent to the district office, which conducts a factual review. The district office then sends it to the municipal government, which, together with the Municipal Military Service Association, organizes a review committee for the final review. After the municipal review committee reviews and confirms that the applicant meets the conditions for deferment or exemption from military service, it is then sent to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters to issue the deferment or exemption certificate. Only then is the application review procedure completed. Therefore, the issuance of deferment and exemption certificates is the prerogative of the Garrison Headquarters, and the responsibility for reviewing and approving deferment applications lies with the Shanghai Review Committee. It is absolutely not something that the Baojia heads and Bao cadres can manipulate or influence, or have the power to approve or reject.</p>

<h3>The Fixed National Textbook Does Not Conform to the Democratic Trend; Suggestion to Propose Discussion at the Basic Education Conference</h3>
<p>[Da Hua News Agency] The fixed national textbook system should be abolished entirely. The National Political Council and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association have repeatedly made resolutions on this matter in the past. The Basic Education Research Association, recently formed by several experts in the education and culture circles of this city, has been holding meetings to discuss this issue. They all believe that the fixed national textbook system is a legacy of the Anti-Japanese War, and this phenomenon does not conform to the trend of the times and is not found in any democratic country. It should be abolished as soon as possible. Moreover, the content of this textbook is of poor quality. Despite repeated revisions, it is still full of errors. The curriculum standards on which it is based are temporary regulations promulgated during the Anti-Japanese War, and its framework is outdated. It cannot be remedied by mere revision and patching. Therefore, it is advocated to collect various opinions, prepare a memorandum, and suggest to the United Nations Far East Basic Education Conference to be held in China in September that this matter be seriously discussed.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Nanjing Women's Basketball Team, the Xiang Team, made its first appearance at the Jing Sports Hall at 8 p.m. last night.

<h3>The Textile Adjustment Committee Held a Discussion Meeting Yesterday; Cotton Cloth Price Negotiation to Be Delayed</h3>
<p>Cloth prices will be discussed after cotton prices are determined.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened an informal discussion meeting at its offices yesterday afternoon around 4 p.m. to discuss the issue of cotton cloth price negotiation. Representatives from China Textile Construction Company, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office attended, including Liu Siying, Wang Qiyu, Gao Bingtai, Pan Shihao, Dong Jiufeng, and Ouyang Lun, totaling more than ten people. The meeting was chaired by Liu Siying and adjourned around 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The result of the exchange of views yesterday was that there are currently many types of cotton cloth with complex patterns, and sufficient consideration should be given before price negotiation. If prices are hastily agreed upon, difficulties may be encountered during implementation. Furthermore, cotton cloth price negotiation needs to be coordinated with cotton yarn price negotiation, so it is better to wait until cotton prices are confirmed before discussing cotton cloth prices. In the future, when discussing cotton cloth prices, several standard fabrics will be selected for preliminary price negotiation, so that other types of fabrics can be proportionally assessed and priced. Finally, the dyeing industry representatives expressed the current situation where the cotton yarn supply cannot be coordinated with the dyeing and weaving industry's needs. The Textile Adjustment Committee will instruct the industry to first collect detailed data for the committee's reference, in order to adjust the yarn allocation amount.</p>
<p>Nine Replicated Industries Provide Opinions</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is reported that the current cotton cloth price negotiation was originally prompted by the Municipal Government Economic Conference. Recently, the city's situation has been stable, and specifying price negotiation may cause a reverse stimulus. Two days before the meeting, the dyeing and weaving industry representatives discussed this with Director Liu, so yesterday's meeting shifted its focus to the principle of yarn and cloth adjustment.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Shihao, in his capacity as the person in charge of the replicated industries, presented production equipment figures for nine manufacturing industries, including dyeing and weaving, knitting, handkerchiefs, towels, blankets, underwear, handmade cotton fabrics, camel hair, sails, and ribbons, explaining the cotton yarn shortage. He also severely criticized the seriousness of the fact that small factories have always been excluded from yarn allocation. Director Liu and Director Ouyang of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office attached great importance to this, and personally instructed Mr. Pan to provide written supplements for a more effective remedy.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu also repeatedly stated that the industry associations must provide accurate statistics for reference in yarn allocation and contract weaving. According to Mr. Pan, a meeting of the nine replicated industries will be convened in the coming days to coordinate with the textile adjustment policy.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Situation of Cotton Cloth Allocation</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] A person in charge of China Textile Construction Company, in view of the company's cotton cloth allocation, made the following remarks:</p>
<p>(1) The outside world attributes the previous cotton cloth price increase to the company's insufficient supply. In fact, the company has always maintained a sufficient allocation volume. In June, it allocated a total of 1,117,113 bolts, with 887,113 bolts sold at the door. However, the total cloth production of the company's Shanghai factories in that month was only 652,205 bolts, which was less than the amount sold at the door in the city. The shortfall was supplied by the company's factories in other cities.</p>
<p>(2) The outside world criticizes the company for unbalanced cloth allocation, but the company's allocation is based on the company's production situation. In general, cloth merchants increase their allocation requests when cloth prices rise, and decrease their allocation requests when cloth prices fall. Therefore, rather than saying that the supply is unbalanced, it is better to say that the demand is unbalanced.</p>
<p>(3) The outside world has requested that the company announce the allocation volume in advance before each allocation. In fact, the company's allocation purpose is to stabilize cotton cloth market prices. If business secrets are announced in advance, it would be easily manipulated and controlled by others, which would not be beneficial.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company: The First Phase of the Plan Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>In the past, a large number of Chinese silk fabrics were sold to India and Southeast Asia. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the unstable Chinese economy and rising costs, the overseas market price was lower than the cost. In order to promote the export of Chinese silk fabrics, resolve the serious crisis in the silk weaving industry, and increase the country's foreign exchange income, the Shanghai silk weaving industry negotiated with the Central Bank to establish the Silk Fabric Guidance Committee, which was approved by the Executive Yuan. The committee provided the necessary raw materials and all processing fees. On the one hand, the industry organized the Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Venture Company, which strictly managed the first phase of contract weaving totaling 110,000 bolts. The company entrusted the weaving to 203 manufacturers in the same industry, activating 2,072 looms, starting weaving in mid-March. Since May, most of the fabrics have been sold overseas, and the rest will be completely woven by the end of this month. Overseas silk merchants are very satisfied with the neat and beautiful products. Orders have been received from India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf. The selling price has also been improving daily. After the first phase of silk fabric is sold, more than 20 million rupees in foreign exchange can be obtained. Currently, the chairman of the company, Luo Qinghua, is in Beijing reporting the progress to the relevant agencies. President Zhang of the Executive Yuan, Vice President Wang, and members of the National Economic Commission, Chen Lifu, and both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have expressed their satisfaction. They believe that it is in line with the "industry joint venture" and "ordering system" methods in the economic reform plan. Other industries can follow suit and implement it. The company's second phase of production and sales plan was submitted to the Guidance Committee at the beginning of the month. It is reported that President Zhang and Vice President Liu of the Central Bank, and Director Wu Rencang of the China Trust Bureau attach great importance to this. They are discussing it in detail with the Guidance Committee and American consultants. It can be approved in the coming days, and contracts can be signed and materials can be issued, so that the company can continue production and tens of thousands of technicians will not face unemployment due to work stoppages.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Favorable Buying Abound: Chinese Stocks Launch a Wave of Increases; As Many As Sixteen Types Reach the Limit</h3>
<p>After a continuous decline in Chinese stocks, they suddenly rebounded yesterday after being sluggish. The Cantonese and Ningbo financial groups jointly absorbed shares, and shorts in the industry rushed to cover their positions. Foreign stocks received special stimulation and jumped sharply first. As a result, rumors of favorable buying abounded, and as many as sixteen types of stocks, both hot and cold, hit their price limits. After Yongsha hit its price limit, the asking price on the black market continued to rise by about half a percent. The gloomy atmosphere of the past few days was swept away at this point, and a vibrant atmosphere was seen. The short side has already been shaken, and large investors have switched from selling to buying, and the trend is expected to improve further.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, due to the loose money supply, buyers were reluctant to buy. When the market opened steadily, Yongsha, No. 91, and No. 231 increased to 195 yuan. No. 223, No. 142, No. 11, No. 110, No. 97, No. 163, No. 14, and No. 83 were mainly selling, with No. 152 selling the most. Yongsha once fell to a low of 180 yuan, and the immediate transaction Yongsha only reached a low price of 182 yuan. Meiya was closed by No. 188, No. 60, No. 237, No. 156, No. 223, No. 157, and No. 133. The forward transaction fell to 415 yuan, and the immediate transaction fell to 404 yuan. Xinyi, Xinguang, and Jingfu had fewer transactions, and it was difficult to avoid the same decline at this time. Later, after No. 77, No. 104, No. 97, No. 231, and No. 12 bought in, Yongsha rose to 188 yuan. No. 152 still insisted on selling, and No. 207 also supplied spot Bing Sha. At this time, it was still sluggish. No. 130 in the money exchange industry continued to buy spot Yongsha. No. 102, No. 133, No. 160, No. 91, and No. 106 bought in again, and the forward Yongsha rose back to 191 yuan. At this time, because No. 186 supplied spot Bing Sha, Xinyi, Xinguang, and Jingfu, it still did not escape the consolidation.</p>
<p>When No. 162 from the Cantonese financial group entered the market to buy, the situation began to change. The shorts in Laizhong, such as No. 223, No. 224, No. 231, and No. 89, continued to cover their positions. No. 156, No. 112, No. 69, No. 183, and No. 14 also increased their purchases. At 10:30, Commercial Press first rose to the price limit, and the forward cotton yarn rose to 209 yuan. No. 173 and No. 169 closed their positions at a high price and struggled. No. 232, No. 160, No. 142, No. 137, No. 129, No. 157, No. 36, and No. 117 suddenly bought in aggressively, and Matches then rose to the price limit from No. 22. As a result, Yongsha spot and forward also rose to the price limit. After the situation changed, rumors of buying assistance abounded, and more stocks were covered. Bing Sha carried out spot-priced black market transactions. The remaining stocks, such as Qinxing by No. 42, Zhongfa by No. 168! Yonggong by No. 42, Xinyi immediate transaction by No. 152 and No. 84 and No. 223, forward transaction by No. 219 and No. 163, Jingfu by No. 56, Zhongfang by No. 149, Rongfeng by No. 104 and No. 83, Xinya by No. 141 (no transaction), and Qinhua by No. 141, jointly announced that they had reached the limit. The entire market rose across the board. Forward Yongsha was purchased by No. 223, No. 224, etc. to 230 yuan.</p>
<p>Around 12 o'clock, No. 235, No. 14, and No. 102 once sold to the price limit, but No. 76, No. 27, No. 94, and No. 55 still bought in, and No. 232 and No. 156 bought in spot Yongsha again. With the signing of the Sino-British trade agreement, foreign stock Yisha became even more , and people's hearts became more invigorated. Finally, the forward Bing Sha was called up to 233 yuan, the spot Yongsha was 227 yuan, and Xinyi, Xinguang, Zhongsi, and Qinxing reached the price limit again.</p>
<p>As a result, compared to the previous close, the immediate transaction stocks Bing Sha, Rongfeng, Xinyi, Zhongsi, Commercial Press, Matches, Xinguang, Shuigong, Jingfu, Qinxing, Zhongfa, and New Drug all rose to the price limit. Meiya, Underwear, Tongyi, and Zhongfang rose to the price limit and then fell back, but still rose strongly by 10%. Datong, Guohuo, and Xinya each rose strongly by 50%, Huafeng rose by weakly by 20%, and Jinglun, Wuhe, Lianan, and Cement each rose strongly by 10%. In the forward transaction, Meiya rose by more than 10%, and Huagang rose to the price limit and then fell back, rising by 150%. Bing Sha, Xinyi, Xinguang, Yonggong, Jing and Qinxing all rose to the price limit. Each old stock outside the market rose slightly, ranging from to 10% weakly, and was also very popular.</p>
<h3>National Banks and Bureaus Sold Off a Large Amount Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, national banks and bureaus sold off a large amount, reaching 65.5 billion yuan. It is reported that the Central Bank sold off more than 41 billion yuan alone. The market money supply has become increasingly loose, and black market interest rates range from 1.2 cents to 5 cents. The main reason for the large sale by national banks and bureaus is that funds that flowed south previously have now returned in large quantities.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Tea Loan Mortgage Boxed Tea to Still be Purchased According to Original Method</h3>
<p>Regarding the boxed tea mortgaged by the Farmers Bank last year, the Four-Bank Joint Office, in order to alleviate the difficulties of tea merchants, made a special purchase and repeatedly extended the application deadline. The final extension of five days expired yesterday (25th). Although representatives of the tea merchants went to Beijing again to request an increase in the purchase price, the result remained the same as originally agreed, and the boxed tea purchase problem was resolved.</p>
<p>The tea merchants have also agreed to abide by the originally approved price and complete the purchase procedures before (25th). If the tea merchants do not apply by (25th), the Central Trust Bureau will not extend the deadline. The Farmers Bank will also not make concessions for the expired boxed tea. If they do not prepare funds to redeem the application for purchase, they will fulfill the contract and handle their collateral, which will still be handed over to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase.</p>
<p>It is reported that the tea merchants have fully redeemed the Tunlu tea mortgaged to the Farmers Bank and sold it to French merchants. The types that cannot be exported are Qihong and Pinglu. Among those that have not yet been redeemed, there are 15,000 boxes of Qihong and approximately 40,000 boxes of Pinglu, with a mortgage amount of nearly 10 billion yuan. Only a few have not yet expired. For those that have expired, the Farmers Bank has begun to handle their collateral. The boxed tea purchase, which has been brewing for more than a year, has come to an end.</p>
<p>Tea Merchants Request Purchase of Stale Tea</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The deadline for applying to the Central Trust Bureau to purchase stale tea from 1946 was yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, more than 20 tea merchants jointly submitted a letter to the bureau, requesting that it quickly purchase the stale tea from last year that is stored in the hands of various tea merchants.</p>
<p>Export Trade in Tea is Scarce in Both Supply and Demand</p>
<p>Another report: Ever since the French Yongxing Foreign Firm indicated that the required amount of 900 tons of Chun Mee green tea, which it recently planned to promote for sale in Morocco, Africa, was gradually being met, its current activity has become somewhat relaxed. However, those holding the goods are still concerned due to the thin market inventory. Therefore, the trend continues to show a picture of scarcity in both supply and demand, with transactions as rare as morning stars, and the market atmosphere remains strong. Other low-end stale black teas are still in demand from exporters, and the process is not declining. Various domestic teas, during this hot summer, are still being removed by the shops and merchant groups in this district, and this continues to increase, with the Anhui baked green tea from this year seeing particularly active sales, continuing to improve daily.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Advance, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to advance yesterday, with people still holding onto illusions. Transaction volume increased to more than 3 million. Unified Series C opened at 8,800 yuan. Rooms 538 and 503 advanced, rising to 9,800 yuan. Rooms 555 and 230 closed out at the higher prices, retreating slightly at the close. As a result, Series A, B, and C each rose by 800 yuan compared to the previous close, Series D rose by 700 yuan, and Series E rose by a good 900 yuan.</p>
<p>Shares in the Yi Sha company rose the most yesterday, due to external stimulus, coupled with rumors of the signing of a Sino-British commercial treaty. Rubber shares were also carried along.

As a result, Yi Sha, Yi Beer, and Paper each rose by half, Jardine Matheson also rose by 10%, and the remaining shares all rose by half a percent.</p>
<h3>Bankers Association to Hold General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The 14th General Meeting of the Bankers and Commercial Association of this city is scheduled to be held today at 2 PM at the City Chamber of Commerce. More than ten proposals from various members have been sorted out in advance by the association's board of directors and supervisors and will be submitted for discussion at today's meeting. The revision of industry regulations will also be discussed.</p>
<h3>National Cement Industry Association Requests Expansion of Gunny Sack Quota and Requests Continued Suspension of Foreign Cement Imports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Cement Industry Association recently sent a telegram requesting an expansion of the third-quarter gunny sack quota. The main points are: gunny sacks are the main material for packaging cement. If all cement factories in the country fully exert their production capacity, they will need 7 million 100-kg gunny sacks per month. Other industries also have many needs. The association previously set the second-quarter import quota at US$850,000, which can only import about 1.5 million gunny sacks, which is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Therefore, it submitted separate reports to relevant agencies, requesting that the gunny sack import quota be relaxed, but the result was not approved. Now, as the third-quarter import quota is about to be approved and announced, the association believes that cement production is important, and packaging materials are indispensable. Therefore, it recently sent telegrams to the National Economic Commission and the Provisional Management Committee, requesting that the gunny sack quota be expanded as much as possible to maintain the industry. As for the second-quarter gunny sack quota, the cement industry accounted for 49.25%, and the quota allocation office has already allocated it according to the consumption of cement factories nationwide. However, because importers are very slow to obtain export licenses from India, they have not yet been able to apply for orders. The association members are very much in need of the sacks and expressed regret about this.</p>
<p>The association also sent a telegram to the authorities, requesting that the import of foreign cement be prohibited. Last year, China's cement industry was threatened by the dumping of foreign goods in China. Fortunately, the authorities saw the difficulties and dangers and stopped the supply of foreign exchange for ordering, completely stopping the import quota for the first and second quarters of this year, which was of great benefit. Now, as the third-quarter quota is about to be promulgated, and various factories have been actively increasing production in recent months, in addition to meeting the needs of all parties, there is already a surplus. Therefore, it sent a telegram to the National Economic Commission and the Import Management Committee, requesting that the cement import quota be stopped to help the domestic cement industry.</p>
<p>Claiming Reparations from Japan - Cement Factories</p>
<p>In addition, the association's claim for reparations from Japan for cement factories will soon be submitted for negotiation. During the Anti-Japanese War, China's cement industry was ravaged by the Japanese for eight years. Some were completely looted, some were severely bombed, and some were forcibly occupied and used, resulting in complete disfigurement. The severity of the damage is rarely matched in the domestic industrial sector. The association previously dispatched Chen Hanqing, Xi Zhengxiu, and others to Beijing to petition the Compensation Committee, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that Japanese cement factories be dismantled and compensated to China. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Compensation Committee's subcommittees have both approved the proposal. Once it is submitted to the plenary session for a resolution, it can be formally submitted to the Far East Commission. However, it is heard that the Japanese side claims that most of the Japanese cement factories have been converted into other factories, so there is no value in dismantling them. It is found that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has a technical team for dismantling and relocating Japanese factories, which will go to Japan to work soon. The association will request permission to recommend a cement expert to participate, so that the investigation of Japanese cement factories can be more detailed.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise Slightly, Cotton Cloth Buying Interest Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation, at the opening, because the Textile and Construction Company opened yarn as usual, prices were once again suppressed. 42-count Sunlight yarn was listed as low as 16.1 million yuan, and people's hearts suddenly became weak. Soon, because the market's funds became more abundant, and it had been falling for several days in a row, yarn factories refused to sell easily due to insufficient costs. Some merchant groups and industry peers had some demand at low prices, and the market showed slight progress.</p>
<p>In the end, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose back to 17 million yuan, an increase of 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was 11.8 million yuan, and Double Horse yarn was 10.05 million yuan, both rising 450,000 to 600,000 yuan. The remaining coarse and fine yarns such as 16-count, 20-count, and 32-count also uniformly rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation, the market was still weak at the opening, and selling within the market was not uncommon. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth once fell to 400,600 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, people in the industry, seeing that yarn prices had risen, funds had loosened, and interest in buying had strengthened, and large outside traders had once again competitively bought at low prices, and small traders stopped selling and turned to buying, the buying interest in the market suddenly became very strong. Chips became increasingly scarce.</p>
<p>In the end, Longtou fine cloth rose back to 426,000 yuan, an increase of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloths of various grades such as Wufu, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and Blue Chicken also rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. Bleached cloth and Serge, which sold well, rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The various cloths of this factory had sluggish actual sales and were trending downstream, but blue cloth and Shilin cloth remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Textile and Construction Company Distributes Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Textile and Construction Company yesterday distributed yarn jointly with the Textile Adjustment Association as usual, distributing a total of 778 pieces, all to manufacturers. There were a total of 267 purchase applications.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Turns Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton prices improved due to the stabilization and rebound of cotton yarn prices, and market sentiment was boosted again. Buying interest in the market was strong, and as a result, prices of various grades rose slightly compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the prices for delivery to the factory were: Lingsai 2.22 million to 2.26 million, Haitijian 1.8 million. The prices for delivery at the dock were: Lingbao 2.05 million, 2.12 million, 2.13 million, 2.15 million, 2.17 million, Pengde 1.91 million, Nantacang 1.75 million, Huoji 1.7 million, Zhoupu seed cotton 300,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Allocation Period to be Divided into Four Times Per Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Central Trust Bureau's artificial silk that has arrived at the port through barter trade with Japan this year has reached more than 6,000 boxes. Therefore, there is no problem with the allocation volume in August, September, and October. It is heard that the monthly allocation will be divided into four weeks, with 2,000 boxes allocated each month. The bureau is scheduled to hold a meeting next week to discuss the allocation method, and it is expected that the allocation will resume next Thursday. The allocation price will be determined based on the market situation next Monday. It is heard that the possible adjustment price will be around 16 million yuan per box. The allocation targets will include newly established silk weaving factories. In addition, the existing quotas will also be considered for adjustment and increase.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Fluctuations are Small, High-Quality Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Move Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets had a total of about 4,000 stones of rice. The market situation fluctuated, but the fluctuations were small. New indica rice from various producing areas entered the market one after another, and it is feared that it will be difficult for prices to prosper. The prices of high-quality Japonica and Indica rice in stores moved slightly, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The prices of mid-quality rice were flat. There were still few sales of white rice.</p>
<p>Flour mills have not yet opened, and retail sales moved slightly, weakening first and then firming. As a result, prices rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Unified flour also increased by 2,000 yuan. However, factory flour was more active, while miscellaneous brand flour remained flat. Bran continued to trend sluggish and weak. Soybean cake sales were very sluggish, soybean prices fell, and market sentiment was depressed, resulting in a situation of apparent flatness and hidden weakness. Yellow soybeans are declining daily, with abundant inventory and sluggish sales. Old soybeans fell another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and new soybeans fell sharply by more than 10,000 yuan. Vegetable oil factories purchased 2,000 to 3,000 packages of Javanese soybeans at noon.</p>
<p>Tea beans were selling flatly, and mid-quality beans continued to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans were in a slump, with supply exceeding demand, and prices fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose and fell slightly, showing a slight firmness of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Corn prices fell back, alcohol factories were inactive, and the North Ocean factory was closed, with a sharp drop of 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were flat, and sesame seeds softened.</p>
<p>The oil market's decline stabilized slightly. Soybean oil weakened first and then stabilized, with no significant prosperity. Clear oil prices were flat. Vegetable oil temporarily lacked fluctuations. Crude oil sales continued to be sluggish in the morning market. At the close, Ningbo merchants inquired, turning into firmness, with prices rising by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Industry Association Again Requests Approval of Purchase Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association stated that the authorities have delayed approving the association's previous proposal for a wheat loan program. Now that new wheat has been on the market for two months, and the purchase period is only three to four months, more than half of the period has already passed, and there can be no further delays. On the 24th, it submitted another letter to the board of directors of the Four-Bank Joint Office, requesting that the previously submitted wheat loan plan be approved as soon as possible. The two main points are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>"(Omitted) The long delay in approval may have its reasons, but the timing cannot be delayed. It is urgent to seize the current opportunity to meet the hopes of manufacturers. The association has learned that there have been misunderstandings that some factories within the association have already obtained loans. After investigation, it was found that only the Ministry of Food entrusted Shanghai Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Maoxin, and Yutong five factories to purchase wheat and process flour on its behalf, which is not a wheat loan and has nothing to do with the previously submitted wheat loan plan. This is specially clarified, and it is reiterated that the association should request that the plan be approved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>According to reports, the office is drafting a loan program in kind. The association members are deeply concerned that the office may handle the wheat loan case together with the loan in kind program. It is generally believed that there are only two months left for this year's wheat harvest, which is very urgent. If we wait for the implementation of the loan program in kind, the previously submitted wheat loan case may be at a time when there is no wheat to buy. Manufacturers will, in principle, do their best to follow the loan program in kind. However, it is thought that striving for tangible goods should be done one step ahead. The office should first grant the original wheat loan so that the original wheat in various places can be purchased and stored in full. Once the loan program in kind is implemented, it will naturally achieve twice the result with half the effort. Otherwise, if the manufacturers have no grain stored in advance, they will be helpless if they want to follow the loan program in kind. This should be the office should grant the case.</p>
<h3>South China Import and Export Merchants Appeal Three Points to the Economic Commission</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is learned that South China import and export merchants recently held meetings at the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General Association, repeatedly exchanging views on the new South China trade control measures in detail. Finally, it was decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, and the National Federation of Commerce, appealing for three points:</p>
<p>(1) Requesting relaxation of import quotas. (2) Permitting merchants to pay for imported goods with their own foreign exchange. (3) Requesting the restoration of the convenience of re-exporting goods imported into Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Among the three requests, merchants feel the most urgent need for the last point. Since the Import Management Committee prohibited South China re-export trade on July 1 this year, the business of various merchants has plummeted. British and American import and export merchants also feel that the import trade to the interior of China has been stalled. Therefore, they unanimously requested the opening of re-export trade.</p>

<h3>"Tiger-Fighting Censor" Wan Can Discusses Why Trade with Japan Should Not Be Opened</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd Quick News</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether trade with Japan should be opened, there are clearly two different views in the domestic economic circle. One group is more lenient, believing that China has tariff autonomy and adopts management methods for foreign trade, so opening trade with Japan at present will not cause much harm to China. The other group believes that Japan is like an old tiger released from its cage, and China is unprepared. After trade with Japan is opened, it will inevitably evolve into the tragedy of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." Therefore, they advocate suspending consideration of opening trade with Japan before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan and terminating the dispatch of business groups to Japan.</p>
<p>The representatives of the former group are Fan Xiaozheng and Huang Yuanbin, and some government and industrial and commercial figures. The spokespersons for the latter group are Censor Wan Can and Shanghai industrial and commercial leaders Wu Yun Chu and Wu Bo Xiang, etc. Censor Wan Can is the original proposer of the suggestion to suspend opening trade with Japan, so his opinion is particularly worthy of attention. Therefore, I made a special trip to visit him in the summer heat.</p>
<p>The name Wan Can should not be unfamiliar to the people of Shanghai. In the famous Jin Chao case, Wan was one of the four censors who were ordered to go to Shanghai to investigate. Afterwards, Wan and others submitted an impeachment memorial of thousands of words, impeaching Song and others for dereliction of duty, and was temporarily known as the "Tiger-Fighting Censor."</p>
<p>Dangerous Views</p>
<p>Wan opened with anger, saying, "Some people think that opening trade with Japan doesn't matter. This view is really too dangerous. It is true that opening trade with Japan is the decision of MacArthur's headquarters, but this decision suits the taste of the Japanese and is welcomed by the Japanese, so we can call it a decision of the Japanese. Japan uses disguised democracy to win MacArthur's favor and then uses MacArthur to solve Japan's own problems and let China become the end market for its industrial products. We should of course strongly oppose it."</p>
<p>"What's strange is that our government has never had a consistent policy on trade with Japan, and it is always passively accommodating. Whatever decision MacArthur's headquarters makes, we do the same, acting on orders, without any free will. Therefore, several of our supervisory committee members recently put forward an emergency proposal, in addition to advocating the suspension of opening trade with Japan, and hoping that the government can have a comprehensive plan for trade with Japan. On the other hand, we hope that the Allies should also plan for us."</p>
<p>Relationship with Japan</p>
<p>Some people think that the current Sino-Japanese trade is "normal trade" between countries, because of this relationship, they think there is nothing wrong with opening it. Wan thinks this view is wrong. He points out that the main purpose of so-called normal trade is to exchange what one has for what one lacks. One party of the trading country can freely choose what it needs or does not need. But there is no talk of normal trade between China and Japan. First, the peace treaty with Japan has not been signed yet, and we have not received Japan's compensation. Second, we have not established normal diplomatic relations with Japan. So, so far, the relationship between China and Japan is still a relationship between the victorious country and the defeated country, and cannot be confused with "normal relations." After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, what we have always remembered after the victory is to disarm Japan so that it cannot make a comeback. The armament referred to here includes political, economic, and military armaments. Politically, we do not want Japanese fascism to make a comeback and undermine the security of the Far East. Economically, we do not want Japan to expand its overseas markets as a preparation for another aggression. Militarily, we do not want Japan to be able to re-arm. To "completely disarm" Japan, the best way is to sign a peace treaty with Japan and make it hand over all the materials used for aggression in military and economic terms. Before this, restoring trade with Japan and cultivating its strength is tantamount to raising a boil and leaving behind harm. It is not only unwise, but also a dangerous move.</p>
<p>Beneficial to Japan</p>
<p>Before serving as a Censor, Wan served as the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of National Central University and other positions. He is a famous economist in China. According to his research from an economic point of view, opening trade with Japan at this time is only beneficial to Japan, and it can be said that it is of no benefit to China. Wan pointed out that although Japan is a defeated country, its homeland has suffered very little from the war, and the economic damage it has suffered is insignificant. Therefore, it is still an "economic power." On the other hand, China has suffered the greatest losses, and its extremely fragile economic foundation has been almost completely destroyed. Talking about Sino-Japanese trade in this situation will definitely create the bad result of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." What we hope for is "industrial China." Although we do not want Japan to become "agricultural Japan," it should at least be a Japan that cooperates with "industrial China."</p>
<p>Several economic experts do not want to use "political power" as a means to "handle" or "assist" foreign trade. Wan strongly disagrees, pointing out that there is almost no country in the world that does not use "political power" to promote foreign trade, and even the United States is no exception. Why should we be so aloof and shout out such a slogan, especially when it is strangely applied to trade with Japan, which is really confusing.</p>
<p>Tariff Autonomy</p>
<p>The reporter asked Wan, "Mr. Huang Yuanbin once said that our tariffs are completely autonomous, and the government also adopts a policy of managing foreign trade. The quantity and types of foreign goods imported are limited. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about the issue of opening trade with Japan. I wonder what Mr. Wan's opinion is?"</p>
<p>Wan asked back, "Yes, China's tariffs are autonomous, but is the tax rate autonomous? Most of our tax rates must be negotiated before they are set. Can this situation be said to be completely autonomous?"</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the era of tariff policies is over. The trend in the world is to abolish tariff barriers! We should not violate the trend of the times."</p>
<p>Creating Opportunities for Whom</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Wan expressed great dissatisfaction with the person in charge of handling trade with Japan. He said, "If Sino-Japanese trade is unimportant, then I don't know why they are so interested in it. If it is important, then I don't know why they are so perfunctory!" He believes that if it continues to be so sloppy, it will only facilitate those "private trades that have no organizational ability or constructiveness," and more seriously: trade with Japan will facilitate "bureaucratic capital that is organized and destructive." Bureaucratic capital will flock to where there is profit. Japan has "bicycles, watches, cameras," which are really opportunities for them to make a fortune.</p>
<p>Adhering to Principles</p>
<p>Finally, Wan put forward several principles that must be adhered to.</p>
<p>He believes that trade with Japan should definitely be a "political issue" and must be assisted through political means. China's economy is so depressed today entirely because of the "political disaster" given to us by Japan. It is natural and right to use "political solutions" for "political disasters." The damage we have suffered should be compensated by Japan, so that we can recover on the one hand and restrict Japan from rising again on the other.</p>
<p>Secondly, from an economic point of view, China is a country with 400 million buyers and must have an industry that can supply the needs of 400 million people. Therefore, China must become an industrial country. China's economy cannot "form a unit" and must be made self-sufficient in the short term. During this period, we must never allow Japanese goods to invade our market again or take away the market that should have belonged to our country. To achieve this, the government should have a comprehensive plan for the entire trade with Japan and should set up a special agency to handle this matter.</p>
<p>Wan also put forward his view on the competition for the Nanyang market. He said that before the war, the retailers in Nanyang were all Chinese, and the retailers sold Japanese goods. On the one hand, this was due to the underdevelopment of our country's industry, but the main reason was that our country's political power was not strong enough to assist in promotion. Now, although Japan is a defeated country, its industrial level is much higher than before the war. Therefore, we must strive politically, and we should find ways to replace Japan. I remember an American saying that "the Far East should take China as its stabilizing force, and China should become the leader of this vast consumer market in the economy." Foreigners have such high expectations of us, and we should not disappoint them.</p>
<h3>Visiting a Hawksbill Turtle Below Plum Blossom Mountain</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Pu Dejie</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Express Dispatch)</p>
<p>"A giant turtle discovered on Plum Blossom Mountain!" Nanjing's evening newspaper published a startling piece of news on the 21st. How big is this turtle! How was it discovered on Plum Blossom Mountain? And how can it have two wings on its back? To investigate the truth, braving the intense summer heat, we set out on the Mausoleum Boulevard.</p>
<p>Giant Turtle! Does it Have Wings?</p>
<p>We first arrived at the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Management Committee. They then led us to the Mausoleum Garden Management Office below Plum Blossom Mountain. We saw the "giant turtle." In a cement pool less than ten feet in diameter, with a shallow layer of water and duckweed floating on the surface, a shelled creature lay quietly. Its yellowish-brown carapace was as large as a small round table, divided like a turtle's shell into thirteen main scutes and twenty-five smaller scutes around the edges. It had no tail, and its four large flippers, covered with tiny scales, lay flat. No wonder some people said it had wings. Its grayish-silken head and neck resembled those of a giant python, spending most of its time submerged in the water. This was a "hawksbill turtle," an animal that lives in the sea. Plum Blossom Mountain was simply its new home.</p>
<p>Three Hawksbill Turtles from the Xisha Islands</p>
<p>In the latter part of April this year, our National Defense Forces stationed in the Xisha Islands successively captured three hawksbill turtles in the waters around the islands. Subsequently, a transport ship from the central government transported them back north in wooden cages. The largest one died of starvation on the way, another was sent to Guangzhou as a gift to the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the remaining one was transferred to Taiwan and then, via the U.S. Meisong vessel, was shipped through Shanghai to Beijing. On July 20th, the Naval Headquarters dispatched a truck and eight laborers to deliver it to the Mausoleum Management Committee. This gift caused the recipients considerable concern. First, they lacked the facilities to raise animals, and second, they had no understanding of the living habits of hawksbill turtles. How could they keep it alive?</p>
<p>Food Costs Difficult to Bear</p>
<p>The Mausoleum Management Committee quickly consulted the Naval Headquarters and temporarily placed it in the pool of the Garden Management Office's farm. They used saltwater to soak it and prepared small fish, shrimp, and fruits to feed it.</p>
<p>The Naval Headquarters' reply arrived, stating that a pond should be built for it, with sand on the bottom and a few rocks placed inside. It should be fed artificial seawater, shrimp, and small fish. The Mausoleum Management Committee calculated that this expense was not small. Even without considering the cost of building the pond, just the food costs alone were unbearable. The Management Committee is considering that if they cannot afford its food, they will prepare to send it to a zoo in Shanghai or Qingdao to live as a "retired gentleman."</p>
<p>Entering the Wooden Cage, it Prefers to Starve</p>
<p>The hawksbill turtle is extremely fierce. In the shallow pool, it does not have enough buoyancy and cannot move freely. Its bulging eyes and nostrils are submerged in the water, and it constantly blows bubbles out of anger. Unexpectedly, it suddenly strikes with its two front flippers, splashing water everywhere, throwing a tantrum. It is said that this hawksbill turtle has not eaten anything since being placed in the wooden cage. The Naval Headquarters and the Mausoleum Management Committee are both concerned about its health, fearing that its starvation may lead to unfortunate consequences. Plum Blossom Mountain is not a suitable place for a hawksbill turtle. Living in the vast ocean, how can it be willing to be trapped in a mud puddle smaller than an acre?

<h3>Sino-British Aviation Agreement</h3>
<p>From Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>The Sino-British Aviation Agreement was signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 23rd of this month. The British Civil Aviation Delegation, led by Sir Baldwin, came to China to negotiate the Sino-British Aviation Agreement. After three months of discussions, an agreement has been reached. Last December, the Sino-American Aviation Agreement was first established, beginning to lead China's aviation industry onto the international stage. This time, the British government, under the principle of cooperation, is also assisting China's aviation industry in expanding to Southeast Asia and Europe. During our eight years of resistance against Japan, all reconstruction work was complex and multifaceted, especially in terms of materials and technology, which required international assistance. Although aviation has been actively developed, with increased flights and the opening of new routes, various restrictions have prevented it from reaching its ideal state. Now, the United States and the United Kingdom are guiding our country's aviation to expand abroad, creating a new situation for China's air transport.</p>
<p>The Sino-British Aviation Agreement stipulates a validity period of four years, during which either party may notify the other party at any time to terminate it after one year. This provision is the same as the Sino-American Aviation Agreement.</p>
<p>Aviation Stations</p>
<p>Designated within our country are Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Kunming. Within the United Kingdom and its territories, there are London, Prestwick, Singapore, Kota Kinabalu, Labuan, Kuching, Penang, and Hong Kong. Both parties have stipulated seven routes. For long-distance routes, our country has two lines, east and west. One flies across the Americas to reach the United Kingdom, and the other passes through India, North Africa, Europe to reach the United Kingdom. Both of the British lines pass through Europe and Africa to China. The rest start from various parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Foreign aviation is for our country to strive for international status and to facilitate the economic activities of overseas Chinese. Southeast Asia is the area where overseas Chinese are concentrated. The economy of Southeast Asia is mainly based on overseas Chinese, and its impact on the motherland is also very significant. Therefore, our country's operation of foreign routes should initially focus on Southeast Asia, so as to assist the economic development of overseas Chinese. In this Sino-British Aviation Agreement, six of the eight shipping stations stipulated by the British side are located in areas where overseas Chinese are concentrated. Among the seven routes, five can connect China and Southeast Asia. This is enough to show the government's attention to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai Line</p>
<p>There was a slight dispute over the issue of commercial operations during the negotiation process. The British side requested equal rights, while our country believed that British aircraft should focus on long-distance international transport and did not need to operate this line. Because Hong Kong has a special status, and its airport is located in Kowloon, a leased territory. For the sake of maintaining civil aviation, Lingguo (Britain) seemed unwilling to agree. However, the British side strongly argued for this point. After several discussions, it was learned that the British side would use seaplanes to fly to Shanghai. Our country temporarily agreed, but the transportation volume was restricted, stipulating that the round trip should not exceed one hundred seats per week. After one year, if an increase is desired, the consent of both parties must first be obtained. This approach is for the relevant Sino-British airlines to exchange documents to ensure compliance. (For other aspects, please refer to page 2 of the 24th issue of this newspaper.)</p>
<p>Beforehand, everyone suspected what ambitions Britain had in the Far East regarding the Sino-British Aviation Agreement. But from the various clauses of the agreement, it seems that there is great potential for cooperation between China and the United Kingdom. In terms of shipping stations, the British side only enjoys transport rights in four places within our territory, while our country obtains transport rights in eight places within British territory and its possessions, which is double that of the British side. Both parties have stipulated seven routes, and our country has not received fewer than the British side, and most are in the Southeast Asian region, directly providing great convenience to overseas Chinese and indirectly benefiting our country. As for the construction of seaplane facilities and the establishment of emergency landing stations, they are essential for the safety of navigation, and there is no loss in terms of sovereignty.</p>
<p>Our country's air transport industry is gradually expanding abroad, striving for international status, which has revealed a very good prospect. With the development of air transport, the need for aviation equipment will inevitably increase. It is hoped that our country's aviation engineering can meet the needs of all construction industries and gradually develop, so that our country's aviation industry will develop by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>Landlord's Tyranny: Eviction Notice, Housing Difficult to Find, Nowhere to Go</p>
<p>Dear Editor: My friend Mr. Hu rented a piece of land with several thatched houses from the Zhang family in the autumn of the 31st year of the Republic of China to open a vegetable garden. At that time, a contract was signed stating (A) the rent was calculated in counterfeit reserve notes, guaranteed by two shopkeepers; if there were any arrears, the lease could be terminated at any time; (B) half a year's rent was used as a deposit without interest; (C) the lease term was five years, and the rent could not be increased or decreased; (D) all property taxes were to be paid by the lessee. Three years after Mr. Hu moved into the house, Mr. Zhang refused to collect the rent on the grounds that it was too low. This April, he again used the excuse of taking it back for his own use and asked to reclaim the house. In this time of housing shortage, it is very difficult to find a house. May I ask (1) What multiple of the rent should be paid for the arrears from the winter of the 34th year to the present? If Mr. Zhang refuses to accept it, can it be deposited? (2) After the expiration of the term, can the contract be renewed and continue to live there? (3) All property taxes and income taxes are paid by the friend; can they be used to offset the rent arrears? (4) The landlord currently has other houses to use; can his request be refused? (5) Mr. Zhang hired a lawyer to send Mr. Hu an eviction notice. How should it be handled? Please answer the above five points, and I will be grateful. Reader Wang Zhongyue.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Duanmu Kai] (1) Starting from December of the 34th year of the Republic of China, pay 40 times the rent of July of the 26th year of the Republic of China. Starting from March of the 36th year of the Republic of China, pay 140 times the rent of July of the 26th year of the Republic of China. If he refuses to accept it, you can deposit it yourself. (2) The residential contract should be renewed according to the original contract. (3) The property taxes and income taxes paid can be used to offset the rent. (4) You can refuse. (5) You should write a letter to the lawyer detailing the actual situation, and have him pass it on to the landlord.</p>

<p>[Question from Xu Jiashan, Xietu Road] (1) I want to install a commercial telephone. Can I apply? What are the procedures and prices? How long will it take to install? Answer: Ordinary commercial telephones are difficult to install now due to the provisions of Article 1 of the revised city telephone restriction measures. (2) My location is at the intersection of Xietu Road and Xinqiao Road in the southern suburbs, which is a necessary route for buses. However, there is no public telephone nearby. Can it be approved for installation there? Can the application letter be forwarded to your bureau through the "Service" column of the Shen Bao?

<p>[Question from Huang Xingfa, Nanjing East Road] I heard that your bureau has a telephone relay service. How does it work? Answer: Because users often spend a lot of time waiting after making a long-distance call, or because they need to communicate with relatives and friends urgently at the bus or ship terminal and the departure time is very tight, they often miss the bus or ship. Therefore, we created the telephone relay service. Users only need to call our bureau's "46278" or 02 "61443" long-distance relay telephone registration desk and tell us the message they want to convey to the other party, or fill it out on the telephone relay registration form at the nearest business office of our bureau.

<h3>The Enlightenment Teacher</h3>
<p>— Huangfu Taiyun</p>
<p>The flow of time never stops, but on flat riverbeds, it appears calm to us on the surface. However, in the gorges with high and low cliffs, its changes and rapids are terrifying.</p>
<p>One afternoon in February, the weather was warm, as if it were early summer. At the intersection of the main street, in a row of used bookstores, I saw a tall, thin middle-aged man wearing a grayish-black cotton robe. He seemed to be rushing to the market, pushing his way in with some effort, politely saying, "Please let me pass." He squeezed to the front of the bookstore owner's red-lacquered table, stacked a large pile of thread-bound books held under his arm on the table, and then talked to the short, broad-faced shop owner. After about ten minutes, he squeezed out empty-handed. At this time, I caught a glimpse of a familiar face: bald, high cheekbones, a pointed chin, and a curved nose above a short mustache. His gloomy face seemed brighter than when he went in, but it was still indifferent. I felt that I should say hello to him - I couldn't be wrong, he was my childhood enlightenment teacher.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, are you here too?" I said.</p>
<p>He scratched his head and stared at me, a look of surprise and shame appearing on his face. He slowly said, "Oh, I don't remember, who are you?"</p>
<p>I wasn't surprised by his astonishment (I expected it). I explained to him, "My name is Rong _, I was your student when you taught at A Town and lived next door to the pharmacy in that new house."</p>
<p>"Oh!" He drew out the sound, trying to hide his embarrassment, "You were reading Five-Character Tang Poems back then? How quickly times have changed!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," I agreed with him, although I had never read Five-Character Tang Poems.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I felt that I should ask him about how he came to be here, what kind of job he was doing, and whether he was still doing the same thing.</p>
<p>"I don't even know how I ended up here," a bitter smile appeared on his cold face. "I'm like a woodpecker, wandering around, contacting countless people and things; but I can't remember any of them. You ask me about jobs? I can't name one. I haven't been a teacher since I left there."</p>
<p>He restrained his only smile, and his face became even gloomier. Obviously, the past life was unfamiliar and unpleasant to him. If I were to ask him to tell it, it would only evoke a series of memories of struggle, frustration, decline, and wandering.</p>
<p>I realized that I had led him into a circle of depression, so I quickly set aside the original topic and asked about his address.</p>
<p>After a slight hesitation, he copied the address of his temporary residence on a small piece of paper - it was a small lodging house.</p>
<p>After that, he left, hurriedly squeezing through the crowded street and turning into a small alley.</p>
<p>I turned back to the shop owner. He was single-mindedly flipping through that pile of worm-eaten, yellowed ancient woodblock-printed books, with a delicate vermilion circle marking each pause in the page. The blank spaces in the book were filled with explanations. These were also familiar to me, like decorations on my body. Indeed, I couldn't bear to let them be lost in this shop, to be taken away by some unknown person in the future.</p>
<p>After some negotiation with the shop owner, I finally spent 12,000 yuan to buy the book. I planned to take it to visit my enlightenment teacher.</p>
<p>The next day, I took this ancient book and followed the address he gave me to find him. But I found nothing. A simple, middle-aged woman came out of the dark inn. She plainly told me that there had been such a guest in the inn, but he had already left yesterday.</p>
<p>A cloud of sorrow that could not be dispelled hung in my heart. He, Mr. Chen, had infected me with something I had never had before, and it was so easy to make people feel heavy and old.</p>
<p>"How quickly times have changed!" I said sadly.</p>
<p>When I was seven years old, a wealthy landlord named Fan built a tall building on a vacant lot next to my house. When the building was about to be completed, the landlord decided to open a private school there. Although schools had been established for several years at that time, private schools were still considered the proper places to teach, according to custom and tradition. So my father immediately sent me there.</p>
<p>After worshiping Confucius, my father pointed to the tall, thin Mr. Chen with the arched nose and date-pit face and said, "Kneel down and bow to the teacher." I did as he said. At this time, there were already twenty or thirty children of roughly the same age who had arrived before me.</p>
<p>Later, I gradually learned that Mr. Chen was also a disciple of Zhang Tianshi, who performed religious services for the dead. However, in addition to drawing some talismans to ward off ghosts and suppress evil spirits, he could also read some scriptures. Therefore, he had already paved the way for "teaching" at that time. When he went to perform religious services for people, we would have a day or several days off.</p>
<p>At that time, I was reading the "Three Character Classic." In the morning, I automatically took the book to Mr. Chen's table near the upstairs window. Mr. Chen picked up a pen dipped in vermilion ink, read a sentence and added a circle, and I would read a sentence with him. After reading the four lines, we would repeat them twice. After that, it was my own work. The diligent or naughty children would read these few sentences all day long, reciting them until they were thoroughly familiar. In the afternoon, I would copy a "Shang Da Ren" and hand it in. It was considered complete only if I could stand in front of the teacher in the evening, turn my back, and swing back and forth while reciting the day's lesson to the teacher in its entirety. If I couldn't recite it, a few slaps on the palm could also pass.</p>
<p>I only studied there for a year, but I skipped half a year of classes. So I can't say how much Mr. Chen benefited me. Only under his strict and unremitting supervision did I swallow the shallow but profound sentences of "Nature is near, habits are far," which contain Confucian philosophy, and force them into my memory.</p>
<p>After the new year, my father sent me to a primary school in the street. Since then, on the seesaw, slide, and swing set, I had long forgotten whether the private school was still open, and whether the Taoist teacher was still sitting as coldly as an ancient stone statue in that new white wood building, circling the children's textbooks and adding circles and annotations to his own ancient scriptures.</p>
<p>After the islanders came, A Town was burned to the ground, and the Chunyang Palace where Mr. Chen lived was not spared. Only that white wood house remained standing. But it was no longer a private school, and a political institution was stationed there.</p>
<p>Times have changed. The rebuilt A Town after the recovery no longer had a "private school" for him to teach in, and even religious services were rarely offered to him. It is said that he wandered to other places.</p>
<p>The vision of time is absent in the eyes of us young people, unless someone mentions it. We are indeed fortunate to temporarily avoid this burden of human sorrow - those like Mr. Chen who lack an accurate view of life cannot withstand this change in human affairs, and they will lament that the times have "become terrible."</p>
<h3>Cigarette Butt</h3>
<p>— Wang Dai</p>
<p>Who abandoned his kiss on the quiet roadside?</p>
<p>Like an empty wine bottle smashed on the hard stone!</p>
<p>Who wants to think about the past illusion of intoxication over and over again;</p>
<p>The emptiness afterwards only provokes his agitated mood.</p>
<p>The red fire is still burning under the remaining ashes,</p>
<p>Like eyes that are hard to close, covered with a layer of thick eyelashes.</p>
<p>The lip marks on the end of the cigarette still seem to be slightly moist,</p>
<p>Perhaps soon a faint green mold will be added.</p>
<p>Once it was also the dream in someone's eyes and the love in their heart;</p>
<p>Turning into a dragon, a snake, the long hair of a woman of love, a thousand strands of wandering silk,</p>
<p>Turning into the all-encompassing Luo Ji to capture your fickle heart;</p>
<p>Turning into a beautiful white daffodil withering in the breeze.</p>
<p>But who wants to think about the past illusion of intoxication over and over again!</p>
<p>Now it will die bleakly, leaving not even a wisp of light smoke.</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>— Xue Sili</p>
<p>(Aureotsrty 1834-1899) was one of the richest people among writers. He was not originally an aspiring painter, but he began his artistic life because he met two painter friends—Renoir and Monet.</p>
<p>He painted many landscapes, greatly influenced by Monet. His brushstrokes are lively but simple, and his colors are gorgeous but not vulgar. He is known as one of the three major landscape painters of Impressionism. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Small City</h3>
<p>— Song Zhu Ping</p>
<p>Amidst the misty drizzle, with a melancholy heart, I love to wander alone on the muddy streets of the small city.</p>
<p>The small city is so shabby: the city walls are covered with green moss and are dilapidated, the streets are filthy and narrow. Along the roadside are two rows of low, dark earthen houses, already showing their age, antiquity, and imminent decay. On the walls are patches of peeling yellow soil. The eaves, dripping with water, are weighed down by years of wind and sand, almost collapsing, lightly covering two smelly, sunless gutters all year round. The weather is changeable, and even in June, there can be bewildering sandstorms covering the sky. Thus, everything in this small city, except for a few green poplars, is covered with a layer of earthy yellow. In the morning and evening, the streets are filled with blue cooking smoke. At dusk, the desert atmosphere of the small city becomes even stronger. When the drizzle is lingering, the scenery of the small city is shrouded in a moderate gloom. This gloom makes people feel empty, lonely, and cold. It also allows them to appreciate a subtle, inexpressible beauty of melancholy.</p>
<p>Similarly, the residents of this small city still belong to that group of people who are poor and content with their lot. For the sake of survival, they work tirelessly from morning till night, without any complaints. They also pursue a minimal level of stability in their lives that they can tolerate. Frequent disasters are only a series of low sighs on their anemic and pale faces. Although the small city has also conscripted soldiers and demanded grain, it has not been threatened by war. Therefore, the small city still has a strong atmosphere of conservatism and tranquility. People are always silent, calmly letting suffering slip away in sighs, and letting time pass in indifference. They seem to have no ideals or hopes, and all their pastimes are just running to the teahouse, or setting up a game of Chinese chess at the street corner, or finding a stringed instrument and singing a few local operas. These things make them feel satisfied. The dim vegetable oil lamp illuminates their birth and also illuminates their death. This ordinariness, however, makes one feel the earnestness and seriousness of ordinary life.</p>
<p>The small city, which has been eroded by wind and sand all year round, once had a period of prosperity. However, it was only a flash in the pan, and following the prosperity was a period of recession, so it declined, and the small city became even more anemic and aged. However, people are not accustomed to the ups and downs of the sea of people. The streets of the small city on rainy days are still so muddy, and still retain that charm of gloom in the rain.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I left the small city and had to return again. The small city still maintained its inherent charm. Amidst the misty drizzle, with a wounded heart, I walked again on the muddy streets of the small city. At dusk, the gloom of the streets of this small city is even more likely to cause sadness and nostalgia. In the hazy light, I saw碉堡s built on the hills around the small city, and armed sentries stood tall on the dilapidated city walls. In the evening, the sparse gunfire was accompanied by the evening bell of the church, gently breaking the nearly twenty years of tranquility of the small city. However, the small city was still the same as usual, and did not feel the cruelty and waste of war, or the more misfortune brought by war, because of this shocking gunfire. (End of June, Pingliang.)</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Zhi Feng</p>
<p>I cherish every dusk in this long series of days.</p>
<p>We slowly stepped along, passing through the embankment lined with weeping willows, draped in a gray hue. However, our hearts are bright and surging. We are constantly tracking, trying to seize some lofty imagination.</p>
<p>We turned into a cemetery path, with green grave grass and tall tomb trees. Between them was a layer of gray-yellow. It was so gloomy that we seemed to see the shadows of many ghosts. However, our hearts are bright and surging. We want to see these shadows.</p>
<p>Piles of graves, decades ago, turned into white bones, but these shadows come to life in our imagination. We seem to see them waving their fists, bulging their veins, falling down, convulsing, and shedding their last drop of blood...</p>
<p>She stood still. From the vast gray, I saw a serious face. From the serious face, I felt a devout heart.</p>
<p>I cannot hold her arm. I should not make her laugh, because from these imagined shadows, she discovered her true self. She had already allowed herself to participate in the center of these shadows. She saw the hand waving the fist, the blue veins on the forehead, the fallen body, the gushing blood...</p>
<p>I quietly listened to the beating of that devout heart. I silently blessed her and prayed for her: to discover some more lofty images from the shadows of fists, blue veins, corpses, and blood...</p>
<p>"May these images always live in our hearts!" She smiled. From the silver bell-like laughter, I felt that what was before me was not a gray dusk, and what was behind me was not a dark night. I imagined us taking vigorous steps in a scarlet dawn.</p>
<p>"Yes, let these images be placed in front of our ranks, and let them lead us to that rational journey and destination!"</p>
<p>She was silent. From the silence, I felt a kind of silent agreement. I smiled. I felt younger, stronger, and more invigorated!…</p>
<p>We held each other tightly. We could clearly count the rhythmic heartbeats. I knew our imaginations merged into one, following those shadows, rushing on our journey…</p>

<h3>One Inch of Land, One Inch of Blood 358</h3>
<p>— Ye Jing Feng</p>
<p>I smiled and said, "Your Aunt Ji must have her plans. We haven't figured it out yet, so don't offend her. It will make it difficult for Aunt Ji to handle things."</p>
<p>"I know, Uncle..." He also smiled, and said to me, "You walk slowly, I'll take a step ahead..." As he spoke, Little Tiger had already run away; along the mountain path, down the mountain, and into the forest.</p>
<p>When I walked to the edge, Big Dummy was already poking his head out, turning out from the corner of a thatched hut; probably to greet me. But he never came over, as if afraid of being seen. He just stood by the thatched hut and waited.</p>
<p>"Secretary-General!" he whispered, "Just around the bend... but Miss Ji is sleeping soundly, she hasn't woken up yet..." As he spoke, he turned and winked at me, walking close to the thatched hut.</p>
<p>The North is not like the South; a 片陰暗 but not humid. But this gloomy atmosphere is very dreary. I thought Yaoqun was only in her twenties, in the golden age of a woman. Not to compare her with those young ladies in the Jiangnan police world, it seems she should not waste her beautiful youth in this desolate valley, and be constantly risking her life, fighting with a group of demons and ghosts. But who called her to be born in this great era; who called her to be involved in the very peak of this surging wave?</p>
<p>"Don't disturb her!" Before entering the house, I instructed Big Dummy: "Let her sleep a little longer; I can wait, and it's a good opportunity to rest..."</p>
<p>Is this even considered a house? As soon as I entered, a smell of sand and mud rushed into my nostrils. The roof was so low that I could reach the rafters with my hand; the four walls were all earthen walls, and they were leaning to one side; probably if there were not a few small trees blocking the wind and rain, just a small storm could lift the roof and collapse the earthen walls. There was indeed an inner and outer room, and the wall separating the inner and outer room was a straw mat that paved the ground in the large courtyards of Beiping, supported by two pieces of wood. Not to compare this with the high-rise buildings in Shanghai or Beiping, even the bungalows in Changxindian are worlds apart from this place.</p>
<p>There were two small tables in the house that looked like a peddler's stall board, and a few broken stools; but there was no bed, and the two piles of wheat straw and sorghum stalks laid in the corner were probably the beds. The only light came from two sources; in addition to the light shining in from the front door, there was also a small, irregular hole in the wall; the rest was the faint light leaking in from the broken holes in the roof; if the front door was closed, it would be as dark as a cave.</p>
<p>Dingyuan took off his monk's robe and wore a set of purple-flowered coarse cloth clothes. It was about eighty percent new; he stood aside nodding and smiling at me, making gestures without speaking, for fear of waking Yaoqun. Little Tiger stood behind Dingyuan, drinking water from the mouth of an earthen pot, as if afraid that someone would snatch it from him.</p>
<p>I tried to reduce the sound of my leather boots; but as soon as I stepped in, I heard Yaoqun yawning; the wheat straw rustled, as if she was turning over in bed.</p>
<p>Shanghai Vignettes</p>
<h3>Friends of Chinese News</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>The US Information Service will drastically reduce its funding starting August 1st. In addition to downsizing its operations nationwide, it will also lay off a large number of employees. This move is regrettable.</p>
<p>We feel a sense of closeness to the US Information Service because this organization "fought side by side" with our news community during the War of Resistance. It often provided the impoverished Chinese news community with many practical forms of assistance in various difficult material environments.</p>
<p>For example, all news materials reporting on the war against the enemy, strategic maps of enemy and us combat, and printing plates that could not be transported during the war, all helped the Chinese wartime news community and the readers of Chinese newspapers. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the work of the US Information Service not only expanded but also deepened. The number of offices nationwide also increased, which benefited the national news community even more. In particular, newspapers in the interior that could not obtain telegrams and special articles from foreign news agencies undoubtedly welcomed the contributions of the US Information Service even more.</p>
<p>However, we are very surprised that the US State Department rejected the funding for the US Information Service to operate in China, so that this organization will enter a state of semi-paralysis. In any case, this is a very regrettable thing.</p>
<p>We hope that the US State Department can focus on the entire China—especially the newspapers in small cities, which need the help of the US Information Service so much. We hope that the US State Department can reconsider and withdraw this unwise decision to tighten up the organization and reduce funding.</p>
<p>If possible, the US State Department can solicit the opinions of the Chinese news community, and it will definitely get the same answer.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Death of Ruan Muhan</h3>
<p>— Bai Ma</p>
<p>Not long after the July 7th Incident and the fall of Beiping into the hands of the Japanese invaders, I saw a news item in Nanjing, which stated: University professor Ruan Muhan led hundreds of guerrillas to break through from Beiping and fought the Japanese invaders in the Western Hills. Since then, I have been paying attention to the name "Ruan Muhan."</p>
<p>In the twenty-eighth year, I saw another news item in the Japanese newspaper in Manila, which stated: The enemy guerrilla leader Ruan Muhan has now been arrested by our side and is being interrogated. At that time, I thought he was probably going to die for the cause. But he was still young, and I hoped that he would not die immediately, and would contribute more to the War of Resistance. In the thirty-first year, I went to Chongqing and got news of him, saying that before he was about to be executed, the prison guard secretly released him by faking his crime. In the thirty-fourth year, Japan surrendered, and the CCP occupied Chahar. He was appointed president of the Chahar Higher Court, and later transferred to secretary-general of the Chahar Provincial Government. At this point, I knew that he was a CCP member. Last winter, the National Army recovered Chahar. When he fled from Zhangjiakou to Xiahuayuan, for some reason, the CCP authorities ordered him to be shot dead on the spot!</p>
<p>His name was Mingqi, Muhan was his courtesy name. He was from Chaigoubao, Huaian County, Chahar. He was about forty-five or forty-six years old. He was about four feet six or seven inches tall, with a round face, short neck, and nearsightedness. Even with extremely high-powered glasses, he could not see people very clearly. Therefore, in middle school, his classmates gave him the nickname "Blind Ruan." After graduating from Chaigoubao Elementary School, he first entered Xuanhua Middle School (formerly Zhili Provincial No. 16 Middle School) for one year, and then transferred to Luhe Middle School in Tongxian. After graduating from Youhe Middle School, he went to Japan to study economics at Keio University in Tokyo. He probably joined the Communist Party when he was in Tokyo. When he was in Tokyo, the student uniform he wore was not only old, but also had large holes in the elbows. He was from a wealthy family, with more than 2,000 mu of good land. Why was he so inhuman? I was very strange at the time. Now I think, he probably deliberately showed that he was definitely not a bourgeois, but a genuine proletariat! After graduating from Keio University, he returned to China and worked as a lecturer at the Sino-French University in Beiping and the Tianjin School of Law and Commerce. He was not very successful, and seemed very lonely. He lived in his own exquisite small residence in the Western City, and his wife and children were brought out from Chaigoubao.</p>
<p>In this turbulent century, the killing of a person is not a big deal, but the death of a person like Ruan Muwei is worthy of study. Because first, he was a person who extremely believed in Marxism. His participation in the Communist Party was definitely not comparable to the blind following of ordinary young people. He should be absolutely loyal to the CCP. Second, he did not die at the hands of the Japanese invaders, nor at the hands of the enemy party, but died at the hands of the CCP to which he was loyal. At this point, we can't help but ask: Why did the CCP kill him? I think there are only two reasons: First, as a result of the struggle between Mao Zedong's faction and the International faction, Ruan may have been from the International faction, so the Mao faction took the opportunity to kill him. But this is purely speculation, without any evidence, and there are two points: (1) He did not go north to Mongolia, but went south to Beiping; (2) He did not take his family with him, but left them in Zhangyuan, where the National Army was about to arrive. This can be used as evidence to show that the former inference is not true. Then, the second reason should be that he was completely dissatisfied with the CCP's policies and style, and attempted to escape from Zhangyuan to Beiping to rehabilitate himself. I remember when Ruan was the secretary-general of the CCP Chahar Provincial Government, a Chahar gentry named Qiao, who was hiding in Beiping, secretly asked someone to bring Ruan a note, asking if he could return to Zhangyuan. Ruan immediately told the person who brought the note: "Don't come back, it's okay if you succeed." From this sentence, it can be seen that he was indeed dissatisfied with the CCP, and placed his hopes on the opposing party. Asking Ruan in the underworld about this inference should get his approval!</p>
<p>As an advanced and pure young man who studied economics, extremely believed in Marxism, and dedicated himself to the CCP for more than ten years, why did he suddenly become dissatisfied with the CCP? This is something that readers should think about deeply.</p>
<h3>Britain, the Soviet Union, and Xinjiang</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>Since the Beitashan incident, the people have paid special attention to the Xinjiang issue. There have also been many introductions to the past and present situation of Xinjiang. The future development and evolution of Xinjiang, together with Suiyuan and Chahar in Inner Mongolia and the nine northeastern provinces, have undoubtedly become a unified whole, judging from the recent rumors.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union should be the first to lay the foundation for its power in Xinjiang. Seeing the Soviet Union's power extending eastward, in order to maintain its interests in India and Tibet, the British had to try their best to expand their power in Xinjiang to resist.</p>
<p>In the era of Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union established consulates in Yili, Tacheng, Kashgar, Turpan, Hami, Dihua, and Gucheng in Xinjiang after the signing of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (the Treaty of the Return of Yili) in 1881 (the seventh year of Guangxu), allowing Russians to do business in Xinjiang tax-free. At this time, the actual power in Xinjiang was actually in the hands of the Russians.</p>
<p>After the Russian Revolution, it declared that it would abandon the privileges of the Imperial Russian era in China, which the Chinese people were very happy to hear. However, the Soviet Union used various agencies in Xinjiang and the complexity of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang to establish communist propaganda agencies and political organizations in Yili, Tacheng, Dihua, and other places, engaging in the Xinjiang Soviet Union movement, and plotting to seize the political power in Xinjiang. Yang Zengxin's assassination of Fan Yaonan in 1928 (the seventeenth year of the Republic of China) and Sheng Shicai's defeat of Ma Zhongying in 1934 (the twenty-third year of the Republic of China) can be said to be the proud work of the Soviet Union behind the scenes. Today, Ahmedjiang's opposition to Messwood, judging from previous examples, can be said to be still in the same style.</p>
<p>In 1896 (the twenty-second year of Guangxu), Russia and Britain signed the Pamir Treaty in London, and although China protested, Britain and the Soviet Union ignored it. China lost the Seven Pamirs (Great Pamir, Little Pamir, Alchuk Pamir, Sadenz Pamir, Shkuzhuk Pamir, Lankuli Pamir, Wakhan Pal). The Pamirs are a key location, and they are the gateway for China, the Soviet Union, and Britain to enter and exit. Although Britain's 箝制 could not seize all of it, dividing it into a rate was enough for it to attack and defend in order to defend against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In 1930 (the nineteenth year of the Republic of China), British Doctor Stein secretly entered the new general and discovered oil fields near the Tianshan Mountains, and privately signed an excavation contract with the people of Kashgar, which was later withdrawn due to Chinese protests. In 1931 (the twentieth year of the Republic of China), the British government sent military attaché Stafford to organize the Xinjiang Expedition Team. Its transportation tools not only used cars, but also airplanes, to conduct detailed investigations of Xinjiang's politics, military affairs, and economy, and at the same time produced extremely detailed maps of Xinjiang. When the Turpan riots broke out, retired British officers also joined in. In January 1934 (the twenty-third year of the Republic of China), Kashgar's independent movement leader Demla established the "Chinese Turkestan Government," although it only lasted for half a year and disintegrated when Ma Zhongying's siege of Dihua failed. But Britain's activities in Xinjiang can be clearly seen in the above facts.</p>
<p>When Sheng Shicai unified Xinjiang, the Kashgar movement failed, the Soviet Union won, and Britain retired. It can be said that the struggle between Britain and the Soviet Union reached the end stage. The power in Xinjiang was completely in the hands of the Russians thereafter.</p>
<h3>Animal Sensitivity</h3>
<p>— Wu Xing Hong</p>
<p>If people encounter a situation where there is no clock or watch, and estimate what time it is based on guesswork, the result will always have a difference of half an hour or a quarter of an hour. However, small animals such as bees can estimate the time very accurately. According to experiments by British scientists, they placed food for feeding bees at a place not far from the hive every day at a fixed time, and those bees would definitely fly to take the food on time, never being late or early by a few minutes. The special time perception of bees can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Some kinds of flies have a particularly keen sense of taste. If the composition of a cup of liquid contains only one part of sugar in 40,000 parts, this fly can still taste the sweetness. Even stronger than the fly's sense of taste is the butterfly. If the sugar content in the solution only accounts for one part in 300,000, the butterfly can still taste the sweetness in the solution.</p>
<p>The moth has an extremely strong sense of smell. If you catch a female moth and place it in the window, after a while, a group of male moths will fly from afar and stop at the window. Because the male moths smelled the scent of the female moth and came to track it. The famous entomologist Fabre once used moths to experiment, and learned that a certain male moth can know the location of a female moth from a mile away.</p>
<h3>Random Talks While Anchored Alone</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Habitual moral concepts cannot withstand deeper thought.</p>
<p>Pork becoming food for human beings is a matter of course. The reason for this is simply a way of life for human beings.</p>
<p>Moral concepts under vulgar habits do not have sufficient reason as a basis. Human beings! These creatures praised as civilized still retain some habitual bestial selfish desires, as well as hypocrisy that is more terrible than wild beasts.</p>
<p>Some people say that the only thing that makes human beings superior to animals is the ability to laugh, but the meaning of laughter is the most incomprehensible mystery; the "answer" may be extremely ugly. Who says that human beings are necessarily more advanced than animals?</p>
<p>I think that philanthropists who pass by a pork shop will not have any sad feelings about the hanging pig's head, because pork is originally human food. Is this so-called "human justice" really reasonable?</p>
<p>If the history of human beings develops more simply, then facing the hanging human head, one cannot help but arouse the appetite of the same kind!</p>
<p>Vulgar moral laws! The true value is despised.</p>
<p>When the Nazis were flaunting their power in Europe, what was the difference between Germany and India? A caring person answered well: "Germany is where millions of people are starving for one person, while India is where one person is starving for millions of people."</p>
<p>The words are short but the meaning is long. If there is only one truth, I don't know if it should side with the tyrant or stand on the side of the millions of people? Smart readers naturally know more clearly than I do.</p>
<p>Brother C, who just returned from Germany, told me a new fable that is quite widely spread among the German people:</p>
<p>One day, Hitler saw three elementary school students on the road. He suddenly wanted to hold a public opinion test.</p>
<p>"Who do you say victory will belong to after this war?" Old Hitler asked.</p>
<p>"It belongs to England!" One student answered truthfully.</p>
<p>Old Hitler frowned and asked another student the same question.</p>
<p>"It belongs to the United States."</p>
<p>Old Hitler was angry and asked the last student, "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>The last student raised his left hand and patted his left chest, saying, "Of course it belongs to us!" The tone was very firm and powerful. Old Hitler happily raised his thumb to agree with him. But, strangely, the student's left hand always tightly stroked his left chest. Old Hitler discovered this special gesture and asked in surprise, "Why is your hand always resting on your chest?"</p>
<p>The student's hand left his left chest, and it turned out that the word "Jew" was clearly embroidered on it.</p>
<h3>Miscellany from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>The Nuances of Making Phone Calls</p>
<p>The rules for making phone calls in America are slightly different from those in China. In Shanghai, each phone call costs one thousand yuan, regardless of whether it connects or not. And in Shanghai, most hotel and restaurant phones rarely connect. If you dial for a while and are told that someone is already using the line, you still have to pay your thousand yuan. It's like going to a movie theater and not seeing the movie, but still having to pay for the ticket—what a ridiculous and strange tale. It's not like that in America. Local calls cost five cents each. You first pick up the receiver, put a five-cent coin into the phone's slot, and then dial the number. If the call doesn't go through, you hang up, and the nickel drops back into the coin return, remaining your property. The phone company doesn't take advantage of you. For long-distance calls, you need to know the nuances. If you simply give the operator the number, and they connect the line, but the person you're calling isn't found, you haven't achieved your purpose, but you still have to pay the phone bill. If, when giving the operator the number, you add "Person to person call," then if they can't find the person, you don't have to pay, because your purpose wasn't achieved, even though the phone company has provided service for you. If you want to make a long-distance call but don't want to spend the money, you can pass the responsibility of paying to the other party. Just add the phrase "Collect," and the phone company will collect the money from the other party. I'm most afraid of these skinflint friends. Once, a big shot from Washington called me long distance from another place, but he didn't want to pay himself. He learned the nuances and told the phone company to bill me. The phone operator was truly remarkable. She said, "A Chinese gentleman is calling you; are you willing to pay?" I considered it for a moment and thought that seventy-five cents wasn't too much to pay. Then she connected the line. That gentleman then claimed his airplane travel expenses and long-distance phone bill from Washington, truly the epitome of shrewdness. Paying for long-distance calls with cash is done after the call. Because the operator can't estimate the time beforehand, after the call, she tells you a number, for example, three dollars and ninety-five cents. You prepare a handful of coins. You put six half-dollars into the phone, then three quarters, then two dimes, and then one nickel, totaling three dollars and ninety-five cents. The operator listens entirely by ear for the sound of the coins falling. If you're dishonest and try to pass off a penny as a dime, she can clearly distinguish the difference by the sound. (29)</p>
