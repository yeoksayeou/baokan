<p>〔合衆社南京廿日電〕陳總長向蔣主席報吿稱：津浦綫可能在數星期內或可能在三月一日前打通，如此則上海與天津即可直達通車。觀察家稱：此對中國之經濟，無論在實際上與心理上，均有直接之影響。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿日電〕魯省府廿日召集魯西南定陶，嘉祥，嶧縣等十九縣黨政團負責人會議，限各該工作人員即日回縣，重建地方武力，安靖地方，展開復員工作，所有交通工具，可由省府供給。</p>

<p>〔本報徐州廿日電〕魯南臨沂，嶧縣國軍，十八日已在向城支師。共軍魯南軍區張光中殘部萬餘人，現據棗北之桑村附近，企圖北竄。臨城北上之國軍，已迫抵滕縣城郊。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州廿日電〕魯南共軍山東軍區司令部，會頒布對目前局勢之策略：（一）以大型游擊戰，小型運動戰牽製國軍兵力。（二）突擊軍後方城鎭，建立新根擾地。（三）利用軍軍寬大政策，派下級幹部滲入國軍收復區秘密工作。（四）在國軍後方實行暗殺搶刦，造成恐怖狀態。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿日電〕魯境戰局漸向津浦沿綫發展，魯南·魯西·魯中國軍，於肅清當面殘餘共軍後，正以分進同擊姿態，捕捉被困沂蒙山區之陳毅。又魯兩國軍廿日下午收復嘉祥，並與在兗州·濟寧間孤軍苦鬥一年零三月之吳化文部握手。鄒縣·滕縣共軍乃陷於國軍南北夾擊之中，已呈極度恐慌。</p>

<h3>廣州當局注意　防止資金逃滿港</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿日電〕自政府實行經濟緊急措施方案後，此間經濟界人士咸認香港為一大漏洞，游資將大量向香港發展。現每日至少有數十人赴港，加入港金銀貿易塲活動，當局已加派憲警沿廣九路一帶嚴防游資逃港，但走私者仍猖獗。衆信游資流港後，難免影響該地物價上漲，故港府已密切注意，若港府能嚴厲統制物價，則此項游資可能投向工業地產與股票方面發展。</p>
<h3>西安囤貨出籠　糧紗布價續跌</h3>
<p>〔本報西安廿日電〕經濟緊急措施令下，連日囤貨出籠，民生品包括糧紗布一致續跌。金飾由省府點存原店，候中央辦法處理。省府公布五項實施辦法，規定遵照政院及一戰區長官部令，禁止金鈔在本省指定各縣携帶出境。有人認經乃防止黃金流入共區</p>
<h3>立院舉行大會　檢討經濟措施　認方案內容尚須改進</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕立法院二十日晨舉行三一金大會時，各立委對經濟緊急措施方案，咸有客觀嚴正批評，認為此一方案需要檢討與改進之處仍多。立院今日會議，孫科主持。討論戶口普查法草案等案後，即聽取刑法委會召集人羅鼎報吿。刑法，財，經三委會十九日審查經濟緊急措施方案經過，說明三委會審查該案時，與會者僉認此次交議者，僅限於該辦法內關於處罰之部份；惟處罰係根據各種辦法而定，而全部方案關係人民負祖及自由甚鉅，如不全部加以審議，似未便將處罰部份加以決定。</p>
<p>請將全部方案　交予立院審議</p>
<p>經詳細討論結果，決議擬請向國孩子最高委會建議，請將全部方案交本院決議。羅氏又說明政府過去所頒佈之進出口貼補辦法，事先並未完成立法程序，今又遽而加以廢止，前後於法皆有未合。此外匯率由三三五〇增至一二〇〇〇，究係何所根據，似亦有聽取說明必要。最後關於物價工資事項中所規定之非常時期農礦工商管理條列與非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法，其所標明之「非常時期」在日人投降一年之後，是否仍能適用，殊値考慮。陳顧遠謂，若僅討論罰則而不審查全案，與立法程序殊多不合。司徒德對該案詳加分析，認其中可議之處頗多，例如將黃金牌價改為四八〇萬，大戶固受影響，然究有辦法，而最吃虧者則為深恐手頭法幣繼續貶値，終至一無所有之小市民。彼等將其辛勤所得之徽款，以高價購置黃金，遭此大變，吃糧實大。美鈔流通政府雖已擬有管制辦法，然難保不有黑市發生，外匯選港現象，恐亦難以根絕。張緊元以沉痛語調，指出緊急措施方案流弊殊大。政府渦去以七八百萬之價格拋售黃金，而今欲以四八〇萬之價格收回，無異事先挖一陷阱，迫人民跳入，美鈔情形，亦復如此，政府於半年前錄取大批自費留學生，當時美鈔官價，仍為三三五〇，學生一再申請，政府迄未允准，今匯價調整為一二〇〇〇始允結匯，狐搰狐埋，言之痛心！緊急方案中之處罰部份，流弊亦大，例如禁止黃金流通，執行時必將予人民種種不便與磨難。司徒德再度發言，希望行政當局有認錯勇氣，不應諉過他人，或將本人所犯之錯誤，令人民代其受過。鍾天心謂此次緊急措施辦法，最快人心者，為政府宣布收買現存外國之外幣；然此一辦法何以不照「管理外匯辦法」中對付國內銀行外匯存戶之規定，以三三五〇之價格收購，而以一二〇〇〇之價格收買，此外收買國外存款須經外交途徑，並須有縝密布置。現一切凖備皆未辦妥，遽加公佈，無異打草驚蛇，使存款者得以改換戶頭。大會最後決議，照三委會審查意見，建議國防委會，將全案送立院審查，以昭鄭重。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕立法院廿日晨開會，宋院長子文未列席，惟致一函，謂：「因事在滬，不一克參加，擬於貴院廿八日例會時，再行出席」。會中以廿八日並非立院例會之期，決議定三月一日舉行臨時會，請宋氏蒞院報吿。</p>

<h3>我政府向聯總建議　機器易棉麥運華　要求出售物資說絕不確　魯克期談話</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十九日電〕聯合國善後救濟總署署長鲁克斯今日發表談話，謂聯總中央委員會即將召集會議，討論中國政府所捉出之建議。中國政府曾向駐華聯總人員提出若干建議，其中之一即為請求更改聯總在華之一部份計劃，以重心集中消費品如棉花及小麥。此項請求，僅屬聯總考慮中各項建議中之一項。將促使聯總以價值二億美元之棉花與小麥運至中國，而放棄原來以機器等物資運華之步驟。中國政府認為：此類性質之基本供應品，其在中國經濟及幣制方面可能引起之豉勵作用，實較目前聯總計劃為甚。外傳中國方面擬請求准許在黑市銷售聯總物資一簡，絕無其事。</p>
<p>以合法途徑，就地出售聯總之物炎，此種協議並不違反聯總之政策。聯總一般之政策於繼續救濟與善後之計劃，如此則聯總之計劃實為雙重之救濟。聯總小麥製造之麺包一雙，售予有力出錢之人，足以彌補另一雙免費贈予無力付錢之麺包之分配成本。</p>
<p>運往某接受國之日用代應品，應在審愼配給及物價管制下分發，俾使人已均有取得其應得部分之同等機會，此亦為聯總一般政策之一。因此，聯總政策避免優先或歧視；不論此項歧視或優先是否係以各人金融地位或其他條件為根據。中國之分發問題　特別困難，蓋中國領土面積廣大，遭受八年戰爭及二年內爭之損害亦至深巨也。由於國內運輪設備缺乏及起於戰爭之損失，中國分發聯總物資所費遠在其他各國之上，極為浩大，實際分發問題且因距離遙遠，國內運輸網破粹及公開作戰之地區而益趨嚴重。同時，山於經濟殘破及政府困難孔多，中國遂朱能建立實施有效配給制或管制來源稀少物資價格之行政機構。由於上述種種因素，中國國內分發聯總物資工作遂成為極其錯綜複雜之問題。中國不若其他受援國，未能在出傳聯總物資中獲得充份資金，充作分配之用，結果，分發費用即應仰給於中國政府之直接撥款，此項撥款不僅為中國政府之財源之一大支出，且助長中國之通貨膨脹。『聯總當局深切了解此項問題，並極力儘可能克服各種困難。對於此項問題，中國政府之建實乃關於此方面各項步驟中之一種而已。整個問題將由中央委會加以研究，希望屆時能覓取途徑，推展聯總計劃以嘉惠中國全體人民。』</p>
<h3>紐約中國新聞社宣佈　對聯總無請求　鄭賓南指出魯克斯聲明之錯誤</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日電〕此間中國新聞社發表聲明謂：華府中國官方人士稱，最近傳聞中國向聯總有所請求一事，絕對不確。中國請求在聯總對華基金許可範圍內，增加對華棉花供應，棉乃製造紡織品最重要之商品，為過去多年飽經戰禍之中國大衆之　本需要，傳謂中國政府有意以聯總物資，投入黑市，與此相反，而必須鄭朮指出者，即過去數月內，中國政府對黑市及通貨膨賑有所採取之最重要一步驟，係在棉紗方面，關於此點，中國政府使用上述諸辦法，已獲成功：（一）紗廠之成本成口，均出售於統籌機關，以限價再售與各合法之分配商；（二）進口棉花，直接配給與各紗廠，以消滅投機。此種辦法之成功，顯然使殺近財政危機發生前之紡織品價格，相當穩定。據南京甫行發表之經濟緊急措施方案，紗布價格，仍必須繼續穩定，為達成此項目標、棉花之不斷供應，應予保證，而過去對付黑市及取締段機之效辦法，允應積極維持。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十九日合衆電〕此問中國官方人士對魯克斯聲明中之一部，已發生爭執。中國行總駐華盛頓辦事處主任鄉實南稱：魯氏謂中國曾「暗示」，要在自由市塲出售貪物，乃係錯誤，鄭氏受其他中國官員之支持。</p>
<h3>霍寶樹鄭重闢謠</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕美國合衆社連日發表新聞，宣稱中國政府會請求將聯總二億元之救濟物資，以黑市價格出售，以期取得現款、而克服中國幣值之危機云云，行總霍署長實樹，昨堅決否認合衆社之報道，並稱：行總從未請求聯總更改訂約，若云要求將全部救濟物資調換，以便在市場出售，則更屬不可能，行總絕對否認有此項要求，在過去行總對聯總運華救濟之物資，關有建議請以較合用者運華則有之，然從無發言人，據答對上述事件未有所聞。（按：關于我要求出售聯總物資事，宋院長昨已聲明絕無其事，今霍署長復有此談話，謠言可不攻自破矣。）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>經濟方案應如何推進</h3>
<p>凡是複雜的事態，必須用複雜的手段來解決，尤其是當前的經濟問題，錯綜紛紜，形同俱發的病症，要靠一個簡單的辦法或方案來圓滿解決，終不免近於奢望。</p>
<p>此次國防會議所通過的經濟緊念措施方案，內容極為繁複，凡是黃金，美鈔，外匯，工資，物價，國外存金，公務員待遇等項，條分縷晰，一概有明白的規定。在性質上，在範圍上，可稱綱舉目張，與歷决所宣佈的辦法大不相同。但是卽就此項方案而言，應行補充或增訂的地方，也還不少。例如飾金的買賣，應如何規定，配給品的實施，與國營事業的移轉，應如何準備，海外存金的申報，應如何切實規劃，使牠發生效力，這都是顯而易見的事。</p>
<p>除掉上述這幾點以外，我們覺得還有幾個要點，必須立卽準備，迅速實行，以免失去預期的效果。</p>
<p>一·出口貨的推廣此次匯率的提高，其最有意義的作用，自然在推廣出口，限制進口。但以本月六日實施出口補助的經騐而言，狠明顯地，沾共利者，無非為一般手頭有貨的囤商。因為眞正經營出口的人，未必卽為貨主，而直接生產的農民，和加工製造的廠家，在高利貸的壓迫之下，恐早已忍痛脫售。如果踢皮球般一再轉賣，從中漁利，則外匯提高的效力，勢必仍為此等轉手交易所沖銷。這短短的二三日來，一般土貨的市價，已經在冉冉上漲之中。此等惟利是圖的活動，斷非空言勸告，或硬性壓迫所能奏效。我們見解，如果眞為推廣出口起見，那麼，由公家出來收購，再行轉銷這辦法，仍不無考慮餘地。而且這項辦法，愈速愈妙，萬不可坐失時機。倘使漲風太速，把外匯上所得的利益完全冲銷，到那時，便無法下手了。</p>
<p>二·物價的管制為穩定物價，維持生產，先把工資穩定在本年一月份這水準上，為安定生活，維持生計，再把物價切實管制，勿使上漲，這在理論上，程序上，自然十分圓到。其辦法有四，一為對於工人，按照一月份零售價實行定量分配，二為對於公務員，供應日常用品，三為對於各地日用品，實施限價，四為對於一般物品，依非常時期農礦工商管理條例，實行管制。簡單地說：就是拿抑平物價來限制工資，再拿限制工資來抑平物價，這個連鎖的制度，倘能切實推行，勿使脫節，那自然是人人所深切企求的事。我們所顧慮的是，（一）各種配給品，能否如期如量，照章供應，這不得不希望各主管機關，矯正過去推諉，敷衍，漁利，迂緩等惡習，努力負起這個重大的肩仔來，（二）管制事項，要使牠勿苛勿擾，有效地實施，允不能不切望各主管機關認淸職責，從過去失敗的痛苦經騐中，尋求合法與合理的途徑。</p>
<p>三·走私的取締這問題，在緊急方案中，並沒有觸及。但是匯率愈高，進口愈難，便是走私的利潤愈原。其後果則（一）進口依舊無法限制，（二）失去了一部份正常的關稅收入，（三）美鈔的黑市，無法消滅，（四）抵銷了一部份的僑匯，（五）正當的進口業愈形不利。所以要收限制進口之效。除掉嚴格地審查結匯之外，甚望政府對於走私這件事，再進一步，採取切實有效的辦法。</p>
<p>四·金鈔的禁止此舉業經見諸事實，金融機關的檢查，違令買賣的捕捉，正在加緊實施中，各地銀樓業，並已因此一律停業。我們相信：這種消極手段，不難收到相當效果。不過人之趨利。何所不至？對付若干細民小販，共事尚小，而如何根絕此風，使此後的金鈔，確實無從作祟，則所關甚大。因為黃金的抵押，到如今，還被視為合法，已引起世人的注意，而租金，棧費，薪水，向來以美鈔支付的，也不在少數。這一類不合法的授受，以後能否完全杜絕，還要看當局的毅力如何。</p>
<p>孟子說過：徒善不足以為政，徒法不能以自行，整個的經濟方案，要使牠切實生效，並要使牠勿生流弊，其重點完全在於人事。有人懷疑：行政上的效率太低，未必能辦得了這種複雜的經濟事務，這也不為無見。但以社會進化，政治上所含的經濟成份愈多。在非常時期，固不得不採取上項手段，便是承平時期，也無法回復到淸靜無為，一概放任的地步。所以對於推行經濟政策的前提，卽人事與組織兩項，惟有希望政府密切注意，力求改進，以配合這個空前的經濟方案。</p>

<h3>杜魯門建議國會　廢止戰時緊急法</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門總統今日請求國會對緊急狀態下所頒佈之臨時法律約一百種予以廢止或修改。總統致國會之咨文有謂：復興工作之進展，使美國經濟得逐漸解除戰時管制之束縛，本人茲請國國會廢止若干於一九三九年後施行之緊急法令，以及羅斯福總統於一九四一年宣布之全國緊急狀態。本入已令政府各部停止施用緊急法令所賦予之職權，此項建議若被接受，有助於國家經濟之脫離戰時管制，及戰時緊急狀態之早日結束。本人嘗繼續研究終止一九三九年及一九四一年所宣布緊急狀態之問題，一俟環境許可，即擬採取行動。杜魯門總統此一行動，乃撤銷戰時立法之第二步，議會各部均予歡迎。總統於去年十二月卅一日布交戰狀態之結束，渠於當時曾聲明全國緊急狀態並未終止，是為其撤廢緊急狀態之第一步。今日總統之行動，乃係其第二步行動。下一階段常為由總統正式宣布結束故羅斯福總統於一九三九年及一九四一年所宣布之全國緊急狀態。最後之階段當為正式宣布戰爭狀態之結束。</p>

<p>討論結果，增加預算三三一億，减少九九億，相除後計可增加二三二億元。決議應增减之稅收計：</p>
<p>（一）田賦：　市府原定預算爲五億六千九百萬，現由預算會請財政當局努力切實征收，可望增加百分之五十，則共計可收八億五千餘萬元。</p>

<p>（四）屠宰稅：　原列預算九六億，該會原擬增加百分之五十，茲因近來物價飛漲，市民食肉者顯見减少，屠宰塲每日宰猪，以前最少四百隻，現僅二百隻，但因征收標準己略增，結果決定增加百分之廿五，爲一二〇億。</p>
<p>（五）營業牌照稅：　現經征收者約三萬戶，將可增至五萬戶，但中央規定稅率改爲千分之三，故預算仍按九億維持原狀。</p>

<h3>專打老虎　不拍蒼蠅　避免苛擾正當商行　監察團工作人員會議　宣團長指示兩項原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟監察團工作人員昨上午十時在警備司令部辦公處舉行會議，團長宣鐵吾指示兩項原則：（一）監察團奉命澈查此次金潮，要從大處着手，密查嚴辦掀風作浪投機操縱之大戶，對於正當商行應避免苛擾，其他小戶則視情形斟酌辦理，以「打老虎不拍蒼蠅」爲原則。（二）監察團之任務，不單爲澈查二月一日以後本市金鈔物價風潮，更須負責執行由央頒佈之經濟緊急措施辦法，以平抑物價安定民生。故任何看關社會經濟之不法行爲，均在監察團查辦範園之內，希望全體工作同志努力進行。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕經濟監察團金鈔組與豺政部及四聯總處組織之三人小組，連日調查銀行錢莊賬目，尚在進行之中。昨日警察局金鈔組辦事處內，工作至深夜始止。操縱投機嫌疑人物之黑單，已在逐漸開列。此項黑單將俟調查工作完成後，呈送蔣主席核辦。昨日有若干錢莊銀行關門停止營業，對查賬人員諉稱經理他往，而拒絕交出賬簿。監察國已下令遇有此種情形可予拘辦。又黃金雖已禁止自由買賣，但政府對於商行及個人存金之處置並無明文規定。投機大戶已套購進大額黃金者，勢必不願依法價售與中央銀行，而另謀非法之出路。監察團日前即會發現某金號將大絛子溶浴成小塊。並且更難保不有黑市發生，監察團人手稀少，耳目難週，深感棘手·金鈔組組長徐幼祚爲此已於昨日簽呈宣團長轉呈政府，擬請對於人民已購進之黃金應如何處理，作一明確規定。</p>

<h3>梁仁達慘遭不測　吳市長涳切痛悼　昨親往慰問梁氏家屬　對生活教育決予協助</h3>

<p>募集款項·共同保管</p>
<p>吳市長稱：梁仁達君於勸工大樓事件中慘遭不測，本人極爲痛悼，現已責成警察局加緊追緝兇手。並令法院同時努力，深信不久即可水落石出，可請家屬放心。現本人所最關懷者，乃梁夫人己身懷六甲，以後之生活問題及遺孤之敎育費用，市府必代僞設法。依本人之意，希望至少能有一億元之數目，籌款之方式，決由集體募捐。固然現時上海市面不景氣，籌款或恐有所困難，然本人決願代爲設法，募集之款項，可成立一保管委員會，請永安公司總經理郭琳爽掛而主持，而由市府及梁氏家屬各派代表一人共同保管之。至於捐款之用途，則梁夫人自有權決定之。</p>
<p>出殯問題·應求簡單</p>
<p>關於梁氏之出殯問題，本人認爲應力求簡單，可由家屬自行料理，另由市府方面，代爲舉辦公祭儀式，由各團體推派代表參加之，以表追悼之意。然千萬不能將其擴大，以致牽涉政治問題，不特影響治安，抑且妨碍募款進行。吳氏末稱：死者已矣，生者吾必助之，以慰泉下之靈‘故梁夫人必須善自珍重，爲死者留後裔，若因刺激而身感不適時，則本人可代爲設法接洽醫院云云。</p>
<p>末由梁大人表示兩點願望：（一）請當局嚴懲兇手，（二）梁仁達之墳墓應加以勘定。吳市長當表示必可辦到。吳氏至十二時半始告辭出。</p>

<h3>本報推進免費助產運動　申請者衆盼各界踴躍惠捐</h3>
<p>近年來，上海的人口不斷的增加，已經超過了四百萬，同時人口的生殖率也大大的提高了。每天在偌大的都市裏面，不知有千百個母親賦予了她們的兒女新的生命。這些新的生命將來便是國家的主人翁，在他們的肩上又復担負起延續民族，創造未來的偉大的使命。但是很不幸的，有許多嬰孩在離開或沒有離開母體的時候，就結束了他們短促的小生命，更有許多可憐的母親，爲了新生的一代，也永遠失却健康或犧牲了生命！我們對於這般不幸的人們，寄予無限的同情，我們也想施以援助，但我午的力量又是那麼微弱，現在只能夠爲她們呼喊，希望得到廣大的人羣對她們給予同情與援助</p>
<p>無數的懷孕的母親，她午也許是處在極端負困的環境中，她們得不到充分的休息，得不到合理的醫葉調理，她們分娩的時候，沒有科學的方法在替她們接生，在各種不合理的襲擊下，她們失去了生命，也許同時會毀減了新生的一代。雖然我們已經和人和醫院發起了貧婦助產運動，俱是它的基礎，仍是語要本報讀者及社會熱心人士的　例和鼓勵，才會羣固起來。</p>
<p>（按免費助產自本月十四日開始服務以來，申請已經核准者有八人，其名單列下：（一）張朱氏·（二）張陳杏·（三）姚飛雲·（四）李秀芳·（五）王振東·（六）莫振球·（七）楊阿英·（八）滿雲仙·以上八人前往該院待產。捐款請送申報社會服務科）</p>

<h3>美大使函蘇外長　商美蘇文化交換　對九項重要建議要求答覆</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓中九日電〕國務院頃發表美國駐蘇大使史密斯致蘇外長莫洛托夫之函件內容，史密斯在函中重申美方關於兩國文化交換之芳干建議。該函日期爲二月三日，由史密斯於星期二交付莫斯科各報。函中要求蘇聯答復由美大使館轉遞之若干文化合作建議。但蘇聯之最後回訊，迄今尚未收到。該函全文如下：「最近報載史太林元帥於接見小羅斯福時，曾鄭重表示渠贊成美蘇兩國交換文化與科學情報，以及交換學生，藝術家，科學家，與敎授等。余對於此事，極感欣慰，因余素來竭力主張此種交換，爲閣下所知者。此種交換足以推廣接觸之基礎，以便貴我兩國人民能瞭解彼此之文化生活與目標。最近吾人在此一方面，巳有若干進步，尤其關於文化與科學出版物之交換，但在通盤計劃方面，仍有不少須待完成者。余拜聆史太林元帥所發表之意見後，大受鼓動，用特請閣下注意上述交換性質之若干建議。此等建議，均爲美十國各機構與團體交中本大使館轉達者，現正等候貴方之同意，以便付諸實施。其中最重要者計開如下：</p>
<p>交換科學家　注重在醫藥</p>
<p>（一）去年八月，蘇聯戰爭救濟處代表團訪美時，楊格博土曾建議以設備完整之配尼西林工廠一座供蘇聯便用，同時並建議美蘇兩國互相交換科學家，尤以醫藥領域內之科學家爲主。楊博士曾就此事與蘇聯衛生處商討，惟截至目前止，渠之建議迄未邀獲答覆。</p>
<p>請蘇研究生　赴美授俄語</p>
<p>（二）一九四六年七月，美商務部之翟普氏及羅溫博士，曾於訪蘇時與其高等敎育處會商，討論美康乃爾大學敦請蘇聯研究生四名赴美從事結業後之工作，並担任若干俄語講授課程，美方並不堅持以派遺美國學生留蘇爲交換條件。其時余曾就此事，對蘇聯高等敎育處有透澈之表示。其時余會獲印象，認爲該處已有接受此項建議之意，惟因秋季始業時日已極迫近，吾人遂無法更進一步與該處作任何具體之措施。旋於十一月間放棄此項計劃。該處一副處長蕯馬林氏最近致函與余（函件日期爲一月廿九日），謂該處對於大使館之建議極爲歡迎，惟在本學年（一九四六——四七）此項建議顯益　難實現。余甚望此項將於春季始業期到臨時重獲考慮，並經接受。</p>
<p>美地質學家　願共同研安</p>
<p>（三）耶魯大學弗霖特教授，甚盼能與蘇聯地質學家共同進行實地研究，並就蘇聯洪積期之地質特徵與彼等會商。弗霖特博士之要求及自慮書，業於一九四六年十二月十六日送交與蘇聯科學專校校長。由於渠係美國權威地質學家，余亟望渠之要求邀獲允可。</p>
<p>美主張設置　蘇女生獎金</p>
<p>（四）一九四六年夏美婦女俱樂部聯盟主席迭金遜夫人，應徇蘇方之請，來此考察蘇善後工作，並研究蘇聯福利計劃，伊曾以總聯盟名義設置蘇聯女生留學獎學金一名。余認爲此項獎學金之名額，可望增加。迭金遜夫人旋接獲通知，謂供建議設置獎學金事，未獲接受，余謹此建議重新考慮此事，蓋此事顯與擴展敎育及文化接觸之原則相符合也。</p>
<p>邀蘇歌舞團　參加美舞會</p>
<p>（五）余最近已將美國舞蹈經理人赫洛克之請柬，轉遞與伏克斯，邀請蘇聯歌舞團參加一九四七年春節將在紐約都城劇塲舉行之國際跳舞會，並於春節後赴美遊歷。此事現正與伏克斯進行討論，但尚無具體之發展。閣下當知，余甚欽慕俄國之歌舞，余可向閣下保證蘇聯歌舞團將在美國極受歡迎，該歌舞團之參加國際跳舞會，將有極佳之效果。余誠意希望此一請柬，能被接受。</p>
<p>美醫師訪蘇　要求蘇准許</p>
<p>（六）余最近曾接到來自美國之請求，由公共衛生處總醫官具名，要求准許霍契加·希姆金·及希爾等三位美國醫師訪問蘇聯，從事研究癌症之治療方法。羅斯金與克留伐兩醫師以及其他著名蘇聯醫學家在研究癌病方面之發展，已引起美國最大之興趣。余本人曾與羅斯金與克留伐兩醫師及穌聯醫學研究會其他會員晤談，所得之印象，認爲彼等最近對於人類與癌症奮鬥之貢獻，或將有極大之效果。美國此項請求，茍能早日獲得同意，則人民與政府均將不勝感激。</p>
<p>美大學校慶　邀請蘇學者</p>
<p>（二）九四六年二月，普林斯頓大學校長杜資博士，經由華盛頓蘇聯大使館，邀請蘇聯若干著名學者，包括卡比沙，蘭道，代維洛夫等敎授，參加該大學之二百週紀念。同時，洛克斐勒基金會，亦向維諾格拉杜夫與顧特利亞勒兩敎授發出請柬。目下普林斯頓大學之二百週耙念雖已過去，但余確知蘇聯政府如果表示願意接受，則彼等將重再被邀來美。</p>
<p>美交響樂隊　邀蘇音樂家</p>
<p>（八）一九四六年三月，大使館以波士頓交響樂團團長凱伯氏之邀請書一通，轉致蘇聯外交部。凱氏邀請列寗格勒樂隊指揮馬文斯基氏赴美爲波士頓交響樂團之上賓，時間爲一九四六年十月廿一日至十一月四日，或十二月十六日至十二月卅日。此項邀請書迄未獲得答復，一再展緩之日期亦已消逝。惟該樂團曾向余表示，謂蘇聯政府如有敎促音樂家應邀之意，該樂團當願再度送出邀請書。</p>
<p>波士頓樂團　擬赴蘇演秦</p>
<p>（九）一九四六年六日，大使館會轉致柯塞維斯基氏及波土頓交響樂團之函件與蘇聯外交部，該函建議允許該團自費赴蘇演奏，勾留兩週，且謂一切門券等收入，均願聽憑蘇方指示，捐贈與當地公益機關。該團表示蘇聯戰時對美國曾有偉大之合作，希望能藉此聊表酬謝。大使館此項函件，亦未獲復，同時鑒於該團所建議之方蘇日期（一九四六年九月）已迫近，大使遂於七月二日再度致函蘇外交部，詢以對於該變應作如何答復。惟迄今未獲答復。若蘇方現擬接受此項建議，余常樂於以此項消息轉告與該團，俾其重提前議。</p>
<p>余殷望閣下能就上述各項建議，（尤其是關於本大使館對於文化科學交流重要工作能作任何更進一步之措置），表示意見，如荷允准，不勝感激。」</p>

<h3>私立中等以上學校經費　開辦經常最低額　教部已分別明白規定</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕近年來物價高漲，經濟情形變動甚劇，機關學校各項經費均有增加，而私立各級學校之開辦，及經常各費，迄未另定數額，致各級敎育行政機關，審核私立學校立案時，標準不一，疑難叢生。敎部有鑒於此，特按照目前經濟情形，訂定「中等以上學校開辦費及每年經常費最低數額表」如下：</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球聯賽　仁餘攻勢猛烈　全黑一籌莫展　甲申勝培爾意外緊張</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚二塲，首幕甲二部培爾戰甲申，此塲雖然無關緊要，然培爾日前曾敗綠林，乘勝之餘，士氮頗壯，故戰來甚緊張，結果甲申以卅二比廿九殺敗培爾。壓軸戰甲一部仁餘全黑，仁餘展開全面攻勢，全黑一鑄莫展，僅賴遠射得分，結果以五十一比七十五敗於仁餘。各戰戰情如下：</p>

<p>易籃後甲申孫摩西首建一功，培爾沈被章還以顏色，十六比二十四，甲由仍佔先。培爾頻頻反攻，奈球運不佳。甲申顏師魯五次犯規畢業，俞祥梓入易，最後四分鐘，培爾追成廿七比廿九，僅一球之差，孫摩西，俞爾稼互中，又成廿九比卅，一分之差，甲甲呂妙盛竄入，局勢遂定，開始玩起麻將，時開究畢，卅二比廿九，培爾吃敗仗。</p>
<p>仁餘大勝全黑</p>
<p>壓軸戰仁餘與全黑登塲，角逐裁判胡宏鑫，胡宗藩，仁餘徐仲已施下馬威，全黑李祖德還以顏色，仁餘孫國政中央突破，吳新運錦上添花，仁餘鋒勢殊銳，全塲只見仁餘天下，廿三比六，仁餘遙領。全黑遂紛紛採遠射孤注之策，果有功效。陸大振，賈幼良，李祖德，均有所獲，然終擋不住仁餘峯頂之攻勢，前半時四十比廿一，全黑落後，尚不算太多。易陣交鋒，全黑何孝光出戰，易出李祖德，仁餘陳渭源易出吳新運，全黑陸大振，首罰得分，張少卿如法泡製，仁餘沈鵬舉攻入一球，全黑何孝光還以顏色，大振，何孝光順勢又中，分數突增。莊友仁五次犯規畢業，李祖德再入，仁餘徐仲已連中五球，全黑遂陷入不可挽救。陸大振，張少卿雖有所獲，奈仁餘攻勢不衰。最後四分時，七十一比四十三，仁餘天下已定，結果七十五比五十一仁餘得勝。</p>

<h3>市場買氣凌厲無比　結股昨又全部小組長停　證交阻止漲停後私自貼價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股昨經過數度掙扎後，，仍遭各色游資所追逐，再見俏利，漲停後之加價，已遭證交阻止，是以漲停後不若前數日之猖獗，午後除永業外，全場掛紅，秘密之貼價交易，仍繼續扳高，惟成交已見减少。</p>
<p>晨開中法美亞內衣均告漲述，開後一九九號三〇號八五號七八號均進，遞交升至二四九〇元，經一三七號力售，六五號二二四號一五四號二〇七號八三號號七八號八四號七六號四九號一〇二號均有供給，跌至二三五〇元，二一八號一七八號八五號來進，水泥勤興景綸新亞五和次為漲停，升為二四五〇元，一三七號一四五號一七七號脫　手，退至二四一〇元，一四號一三三號二三二號七六號再進至二五二〇元，掉期貼價見昂，一四五號二三二號二三一號一五一號脫手，退至二四一〇元，一四號七六號再進至二四七〇元，一五一號一七七號一五二號力售遂退至二三九〇元，七六號二二號一四二號九七號進至二五四〇元，一九八號二二四號曾賣到二四九〇元，十一時半後漲風復起，運交之信和景福永公以及景福勤興均吿漲停，一四號一四二號一七九號爭購，永紗亦吿漲停矣。此後進行貼價，暗盤美亞加二百元，遞永紗三十元結束。結果較前收計永紗美亞華豐新光景福勤均吿漲停，信和迫近漲停，遞交永紗信和美亞華豐新光漲停，景福迫漲停，冷股商務榮體中絲火柴漲半成至一成，餘均漲停。</p>

<h3>紗市過程　平穩堅定</h3>
<p>昨紗市平穩之至，人心尙堅定，緣底價已廉，頗有不易再跌之勢，因原料昂貴，開支日增，衡諸成本，紗廠已無利潤可言，是以客銷雖然沉寂已久，價尙能站定。二十支普通紗約好三五萬，特雙馬收盤價與前日相仿，四十二支略挫五萬至十萬，其餘各支榮辱互見，目下紗市仍在盤旋之局。</p>

<h3>桐油仍乏做開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本日桐油仍乏做開，產地頻頻報漲，價駢出口高峯。據本市某行商稱：漢口來電，香港方面，頗有吸胃，加以出口外匯提高，雙重刺戟，以致脚地甚堅，且市貨缺乏，出價愈抬愈高。昨日漢市每担巳近四十萬關，杭州方面，雖產地到貨尙多，價亦不低，早站立于四十萬之高峯。本市同業議價，每担為四十五萬，實與出口價格碰頂，甚或巳經超過，大市面尙未聞有成交。又內銷桐油，頂西洪吉盈豐，早已絕跡，副西洪亦吿匱乏。聞僅某行一家，尙有存貨，日來到貨，雖不甚多，但小量則接踵而至。</p>
<h3>皮貨價格挺升　猶太商搜羅甚力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃狼皮，權皮，白猶皮，豹皮，靑山羊皮，新價巳極度挺升，較之二月六日以前，均已上漲一二倍。黃狼皮由每對一萬四千升至三萬二千元，獾皮每個由八千元升至一萬五千元，白猶皮由九千元升至一萬七千元，豹皮由十七萬升至二十萬元，靑山羊皮由六千元升至一萬三千元，市况活躍，猶太商搜羅甚力，出口前途，頗呈樂觀。</p>
<h3>猪鬃喊價不一　腸衣新價未議成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日猪鬃喊價，上海一七號　，仍在三百萬之間。漢口重慶鬃，以產地尙無正式做開，此間喊價仍屬不一。據業中人云，滬市日來即可做出新價。</p>
<p>腸衣　以同業間對經營及收購價格，步驟不一，新價現尙在阻逗中。</p>
<p>棓子　肚掊·角掊，新價開出後，今市價又擢升。每担（一三三磅）已升至三十二萬元，較二月六日以前每担十七萬元，逈然不同，價格已邁步漲上一倍。</p>
<h3>成交中次居多　米糧供求兩少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日南北二市米糧來貨，共到一萬七千九百餘石，供求兩少，成交以中次居多，高料頗稀，勢成高俏决平之狀。</p>
<p>食油　因塲外較審議價格為鉅，市塲均無做開。聞塲外暗中生豆油及蕭油一致下挫萬餘元，豆餅汕頭厦門略動，售主亦堅，市面穩定。　黃豆　南洋福州採納上漲二三千元，麵粉以原料昂貴，轉挺一二千元。麩皮實銷不旺，早定午疲，軋小三五百元。芝蔴南洋動而不暢，無甚榮辱。生仁香港南洋動辦，去化香燥，節節上升，續漲一萬五六千元。綠豆到銷兩淡，價格平平。赤豆來去亦然兩稀，市况平庸。蠶豆漲定之格，仁糧暫乏軒輊。苞米胃呆少神，市勢下游，續低一二千元。山芋干來貨漸多，逐步下降，再跌二三千元。棉餅以燃料上漲隨之堅挺，小麥貨稀牢硬。</p>
<h3>茶葉輪出商公會　討論外銷辦法　決議仍請政府出價收買</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市茶葉輸出商業同業公會，為討論如何推銷卅五年度華茶外銷事宜，特於昨日下午二時起，假寗波同鄉會召開臨時會員大會。出席會員代表七十餘人，由理事長唐季珊任主席。討論至六時許，始吿散會，結果決議三點：（二）去年所收茶葉，仍請政府收購。各種茶葉之中心收購價格，祁門紅每担一百十八萬八千元，陳綠每祖九十五萬元，平綠六十七萬元。並要求收購期限，最長不得超過兩個月。（二）組織茶葉輸出推銷委員會。如政府決定收購，則協助政府推銷輸出。否則，則自行設法輸出。（三）如政府不允收購，則原有農民銀行之貸款，望能再展期三個月至六個月。同時要求按原貸額加貸四成，以便抵充外銷費用。</p>
<h3>綠茶一批成交</h3>
<p>沉寂多日之茶市，昨晨依然未見開朗。這後一部份向受法屬非洲埀愛之抽珍·珍眉·針眉·等綠茶，在午昌茶葉公司及協和·同孚·等洋行，與貨方作熱烈之磋商後，已有一千餘箱卅五年度新茶，獲得正式成議。價格方面，土莊屯溪珍眉每担躍升至六十萬元，溫州珍眉每担晉叩四十五萬元關。他若溫州針眉，自廿二萬至廿七萬元不等，溫州副秀眉亦俏達十八萬元，巿氣一致激昂。至英商出口行注視之祁門紅茶，因吐納談判未見順利，市上仍僅有喊價，缺乏做開。其他花色，猶極岑靜。</p>
<h3>收購棉紗價格　仍按產本核算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會第廿五次例會，於昨日下午四時許，在市府會議室舉行，討論迄五時卅分散會。議決各案如次：（一）增加卅四支及四十二支三合股紗價二種。前者價格三百十萬零二千元，後者價格四百廿一萬六千元。（二）收購棉紗，以大包為準。各廠非以大包設備者，不得以草包替充。（三）收購紗價之議定，六區棉紡公會提供辦法四項，決議仍按實際生產成本核算。該項新收購價格，由紡管會計算後，交由吳兼主委於今晨十時送呈宋院畏核定，明日可望公布施行。</p>
<h3>烟煤行盤下降　白煤销路仍活躍</h3>
<p>煤市白煤因時令關係，銷路仍為活躍，並因來路不多，故市價繼續穩站高峯，姻煤因民營工廠用配煤，逐步配出，市上現貨亦見鬆動，行市隨之頻見回降，而受主尙缺，恐再有回軟趨勢。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥　上海市医師公會主編　復刋第一期</p>
<h3>我們的立場</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>大凡每逢一種刋物在發刋的時候，照例總有一番開塲白式的東西來宣示他們工作的方針和範團。我們這個副刋是上海市醫師公會所主持的週刋，也是代表全上海的醫師和本報讀者們接觸的惟一機構。所以這個副刋的使命是相當的重大而且繁重的。我們深知這個職責的重大和自己能力的薄弱，因此特地藉着本刋復刋的機會，簡略地陳述本刊今後工作的方針和範圍。一方面固然是希望本刋同人藉此有所遵循，他方面也希望本市的同道能够切實合作，以期共同完成這個偉大的使命。假使本市當局和本報讀者能够時時給予我們以指示和臂助，那更是我們衷心所期望而且是萬分感激的了。</p>
<p>（一）我們要成為讀者們的醫刋：所有讀報紙的人們大多數對於醫學性質的副刊都是不感興趣的，因為那些刋物多半是太專門化了，往往令人感覺得頭痛而不能把牠讀完。而且那些刊物有時是那般的枯燥無味，簡直是敎師對學生說敎式的方式。所以有許多人說，這些刊物是專門給醫師們自己看的，並不是給我們普通的讀者們看的。本刊同人正視了這個現實，所以竭力想法避免這種缺點。我們要用輕快明顯的筆調叙述或解釋「醫」「藥」兩方面的種種問題，務使人人讀了本刊都能了解，都能得着實益，成為每個讀者都要看的刊物，不致於成為專門寫給醫者們自己看的刊物。這種工作雖則不很容易，但是我們自信一定能够勉力以赴的</p>
<p>（二）報吿「醫」「藥」方面的新方法和新經騐：我可以老實不客氣地說一句：「不但讀者們對於新的醫藥方法和經騐不容易曉得，就是普通一般的醫師往往因為診務的忙常或則其他人事方面的關係也沒有機會去曉得。這句話看上去雖則有些過火，其實也是事實。因為在學校裏有敎授方面可以詢問，在醫院裘有主任之類可以請敎，但是在私人診所裏呢，倘使墨守成法下去，那眞是孤陋寡聞得簡直到可憐了。我們試想想看，科學是日新月異的，假使不跟着潮流前進，那就得落後而被淘汰的，有些醫生自己坐在診所裏等病人，不曉得和同道們聯絡交換些新知識，不曉得定閱國內外的醫學刊物，如此的年長月久之後，那有不變成孤陋寡聞的醫師呢？而且，目下的醫學又是日益精進，我們也決其沒有許多時間，讀遍本國及歐美各國的醫學雜誌，所以本刋如果能够集合了醫師公會全體的力量，忠實地報道國內和國外的新醫藥學，那末不但讀者們可以得益，而且也一定會被同道們所歡迎的。</p>
<p>（三）忠實地介紹或評論市上的新醫法和新藥：我們中國人向來有一種劣習慣，很歡喜盲目地相信新出的藥物或新行的醫法，這種飢不擇食的方式，對於病家是最危險不過的，因為我們這個國家自從抗戰以來，社會的道德已經淪喪到了極點，有許多奸商往往就利用國人「病急亂投醫」的弱點去巧立名目販賣些什麼新藥去騙錢。這不但直接對於病家有害，而且問接也可以使一般民衆對於新的醫藥失去了信仰。本刋看到了這一點，所以希望能够忠實地介紹或批評那些目前在市上新出的藥物或則新近盛行的醫法。</p>
<p>（四）協助衛生當局對於衛生方面的設施：我們大家誰都不能否認，目前的衛生設施尙未臻於完善地步。譬如對於防疫的問題，垃圾的處置問題，傳染病的隔離問題以及貧病的救濟問題等等，我們覺得還有許多地方需要改進的。我們以在野的立塲，雖然不便批評衛生行政方面的設施，可是我們或許也有他們衛生當局所不能見到的見地。假使我們能够在本刋發表我們的見地，對於衛生設施方面有所裨益，那豈不是更好的事情嗎？所以本刋也希望在這一方面能够盡一點力量。</p>
<p>（五）為讀者們解答醫藥方面的種種疑難問題：從已國十四年的時事新報副刋「生命與健康」到現在，筆者曾經做過許多刋物的醫事問題解答者。我深知這種工作的繁重和困難，我可以很坦白地說一句：在這一方面我是失敗了，我很對不起那些來信詢問的讀者們。這並不是因為我回答不出，或則回答得不好，實在因為來信仰問的人太多了，不單只東問西問不勝其煩　，而且也非常的重複，使我的熱忱逐漸地煮懈，結果就把所有的信件積壓下來，（近來大公報的醫藥關刋編者也為此大大的嘆苦），這不但是辜負了牘者們的期望，而且也有背我們的初衷。這是何苦來呢？所以我說是失敗了。我又去看看別人的解答，也難使人滿意，不是回答得牛頭不對屬　，就是回答得太簡單。這對於讀者們有什麼裨益呢？還有些人老在打自己的算盤，拚命把病人往自己的診所裏拉，這更是與原意相反，我們也用不倚去提它了。</p>
<p>那末對於這稱解答方面的種種困難問題，難道就沒有辦法解決了嗎？有的，我以為是有辦法的，我們願與讀者們相約，只要是有研究價値的疑難雜症，我們必定與各位專家商討之後給與詳細的答覆。假使是普遍的病症呢，只要它是有解答的價値，那未我們一定也會把各人的問題綜合起來，作一箇詳細的總答覆（譬如肺結核的診療問題，我們可以來一下很詳細的答覆，以後就不再答覆了）這樣子不單只患病者自己有所裨益，而且其他的讀者也可以有所參考，同時對於本刊的同人也可以减輕了不少的工作。這豈不是三方面都有利益的工作嗎？所以我們以後就希望在這方面用這種方式來工作。」</p>
<p>除了以上五條是我們今後工作的目襟之外，我們還有許多工作要做的，譬如「關於中西醫的爭論」問題，「甄別醫師的進修」問題，以及「西醫人才的建設及其速成」等等問題，我們都要加以詳細的探討。不過，我們不願意太多預的，我們只願意脚踏實地向着上述的五種目標前進，只有事實是勝過雄辯的。</p>
<p>好，我們努力前進吧，但願讀者們時時給予我們以臂助和指正！</p>
<h3>關於所謂治癆新藥Streptomycin的效用問題</h3>
<p>— 吳曼青</p>
<p>一個病人在絕望的時候總希望另外有什麼奇蹟出現。這是無可奈何的事情，也是情有可原的事實。譬如關於癆症方面的治療方法罷，有多少人是在失望中求得了希望，又在希望中變成了失望。唉，這是多末凄慘的事情呵，然而事實總是事實，我們有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利前後，我們耳頭耳尾常常聽見美國已經發明了一種治癆特效藥，名字呌做Stre-ptomycin（斯突立妥美新）那時不但一般患癆病的人都在希冀着，就是我們醫師也為着它大大地興奮，心想對於癆病的治療問題總有辦法可想了。可是，現在勝利已近兩年，所謂治癆的特效藥老是姍姍其來遲。這眞是盼煞人了。我為此苦悶着，不但向同道們打聽，而且也去設法查閱關於此藥的文獻，想探求它的究竟。可是結果是令人失望，因為有些醫師說它很有效，又有些醫師說它有百份之八十以上的效力，而一部份的醫師呢，却說它的效力是不可靠的。至於美國所出版的文獻呢，雖然有些說它很有效力，但是有許多的學者却說它在臨床方面還不能有切實的批價。總而言之，這個斯突立妥美新雖然不能說它對於癆症方面沒有效力，但是「特效」二字總不能加在它的頭上了。</p>
<p>新近我獲得了一批斯突立妥美新，它是美國禮來藥廠的出品。我看見了它的仿單，明明寫着它「對於配尼西靈所不能生效的病菌是可能有效的，不過對於癆症，馬耳他熱及傷寒症等病此時尙不能引用」。我們想想看，禮來藥廠是美國的大藥廠，他們的態度是公正的，他們一定不會有生意不肯做的，但是也一定不會花言巧語去騙人上當的。所以我可以很明白的吿讀者，所謂癆病特效藥的斯突立妥美新只是被人利用的羔羊而已，它本身是無罪的。</p>
<p>那末，期突立妥美新是沒有用的藥物嗎?不，它有許多的用途，不過不屬於癆病方面而已。關於它的詳細情形，有楊士達醫師另文細述，恕我不再嚕囌了。</p>
<p>不過，最後我還要說一句：那些可憐的癆病者們這次又從希望中跌落到失望中了。</p>
<h3>脾藏的問題</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>現在我國的科學醫界，對於瘧疾的病人，對於傷寒的病人，對於白血病的病人，對於黑熟病的病人，他們幾種病人的左側腰部以上，肋骨以下，所生出來的一個痞塊，都呌做脾購。這個「脾」字是弄錯了！原來脾是我國古醫書所有的字，但是常常脾胃連說；像素問厥論說道：「脾主為胃行其津液者也」。靈蘭秘典說道：「脾胃者，倉廩之官，五味出焉」。太陰陽明論說道：「脾藏者常著胃。」又說道：「脾與胃以膜相連耳」。靈樞本輸篇說道：「脾合胃」，隋朝的巢氏病源候論，唐朝的孫思邈千金方，王燾外臺秘要，也是脾胃連說，宋時代的聖濟總錄也是同樣，金元四大家有李東垣脾胃論，一直到了現在，都認脾胃兩個藏器是一家人所以脾這個東西無疑地是消化系統的藏器。</p>
<p>又素問藏氣法時論說道：「脾色黃」。陰腸明論說道：「脾者土也，治中央」。可以知道牠的色是黃的，牠的所在是中央，所以看牠的顏色，牠的地位，和他的生理作用，無疑地就是現在的胰子油。英文寫做Pancreas，是生在胃的後面，是能分泌三種消化液，流出到十二指腸，來消化從胃中出來到十二指腸而胃所未曾消化完全的食物，牠能繼承胃的消化工作，來完成消化這件事。內經說「為胃行其津液」，其實胃液不是脾所分泌而為胃自己所分泌的，只可以說「繼胃而完成其消化」·總之古人的觀察，大都蒙混，不能够精細分別，這也不必深深追究。然而舊醫書上所說的「脾」是現在的「胰」，已經是的確不磨的了，總沒有疑惑了。日本人呌做「膵」，這個字我們中國字書裏面沒有，不知何以新造一個膵字來代表脾藏？項要追究他膵字出現的時代，方才可以明白，章太炎老夫子說恐怕是一脺」字的訛字，禮記郊特牲有「脾胃」，（音律聊）鄭康成註說道：「腸間脂也」，這說也只好當做疑詞，不能說是確實。</p>
<p>至於現在新醫們所說的脾藏呢，說也奇怪，中國醫書裏面從來沒有說起這個藏器，我也曾和章太炎老夫子討論過，他也說中國醫書沒有說起這伴東西。在英文寫做Spleen，德文寫Milz，日本人貿貿然把我們中國的脾字去譯牠，實在是錯誤了。中國的新醫，也就貿貿然接受他的錯誤。來指鹿為馬。硬把古今慣用來代表消化系分泌腺的「脾」字讓給別人，却用古來醫書不慣見的俗話「胰子油」來代表。再硬把古來醫書所沒有說起過的血行腺，而且碰着傳染病，往往會脹大的一個藏器，却把「脾」字招牌掛在他身上去，實在是太不妥當了，太笑話了，關心科學名詞的同道們，是應該切實注意的。</p>
<h3>「斯脫來多滿新」Streptomycin治療結核的檢討</h3>
<p>— 楊士達</p>
<p>在三前。我們聽到美國已發明結核症的特効藥，名「斯脫來多滿新」（Streptomycin），彼此抄記起名字，不要把這樣一件重要的裏名忘記了。一天天的盼望着勝利到臨後，這樣一種結核症的救星，早日可以從美國輸來，救救我國整千整萬的結核病人。果然勝利後不久，就有少數由特殊方法，帶來上海，少數人在試用。近數月來已有大量進口，在報章廣吿招徠生意，售價相當昂貴，我國醫學界也多數沒有用過，不免要引起多數人的懷疑。當然對於不治之症如結核病，華價的昂貴到不成問題，生命究竟比金條値錢，成問題的到是「斯脫來多滿新」究竟有沒効力，有効的程度有多少？這是每個病家要問，多數醫界同道一時難以答復的問題。筆者學識膚淺，對於該藥在市立第四醫院小兒科病室，雖曾試用過少數，不敢就下斷語，今把最近美國醫學會雜誌，H.Corwin　Hinshaw應曉氏等,所發表關於用「斯脫來多滿新」治療結核症一百人的結果，撮要報吿，以作答復對於「斯脫來多滿新」的疑問。</p>
<p>世界上人類的大敵有三種，就是梅毒，痛腫及結核。每年整千整萬的人死在這三種敵人的手上，各國的學者對於消滅敵人的武器，沒有一天不在埋頭研究，苦幹，絞腦汁。對於梅毒及癌腫，已先後有六〇六及鐳錠的發明，可以收撲滅敵人的相當的効果，唯有對於結核症的特効藥，遲遲難以發現。遠在六十年前，吾人已認識能阻止結核菌在試管中發育的藥品，但試用於患結核病的動物身上，就不生効力。直到近年化學治療學突飛猛　之後，有各種磺　化合物的發明，對人工傳染的結核症，在在動物身上有治愈的可能。自一九四三年「華克士滿氏（Waksman）發見「斯脫來多滿新」後，知道許多「配尼西林」不能抵抗的病菌，「斯脫來多滿新」能發生効力，華氏等首先試用在患人工傳染的結核動物的身上，効果甚為滿意。H.Corwin　Hinschaw氏等曾在臨床上試用二年，治療各種結核症，共計一百例之多。（見後附表）其中有數位病人患一種以上或一處以上的結核。因近來「斯脫來多滿新」已在市上發售，有將治療結果發表的必要。其所發的結核皆內科及外科醫師，日常所治療的各型，固非局限於肺癆。</p>
<p>「斯脫來多滿新」的臨床應用，係根據試騐室所得的結果；用致配量的結核菌傳染動物後，「斯脫來多滿新」能使傳染的結核，停止進行。H.Corwin　Hinschaw氏等的新近觀察，更能令人信任，病體的消解，　維化或石　化言能發見於各種動物，病變的表面消滅，至少可見於百分之三十的被治療的動物中。結核棄試騐由陽性變成陰性，動物器臟中的結核萬，用任何敏銳的細菌檢查，亦不能證明其存在。</p>
<p>用「斯脫來多滿新」所治療的各型結核表</p>
<p>例型　例數粟粒狀結核及結核性腦膜炎　十二例</p>
<p>成人非外科性肺結核　三十二例</p>
<p>呼吸道結核性潰爛病變　七例</p>
<p>結核性膿胸　七例</p>
<p>結核性痔　　十五例</p>
<p>泌尿道結核　十五例</p>
<p>骨及關節結核　五例</p>
<p>成人外科性肺結核　七例</p>
<p>其他各型結核（患一型或一處以上之結核）　十一例</p>
<p>「斯脫來多滿新」備有治療慢性疾病的物學性質。最近製造上的進步，能得到更純潔及毒性减弱的出品，可惜製造成品，甚費金錢，且難得大量的出品，以供結核治療的應用。</p>
<p>治療粟粒狀結核及結核性腦膜炎的結果。</p>
<p>H.Corwin　Hioschaw氏等曾用「斯脫來多滿新」治療十二位病人患瀰漫性結核，九位有顯著的腦膜炎徽，二位曾行屍體解剖，證實腦部有病變，一位祇患粟粒狀結核，無神經系病態。十二位病人中六位已死亡，屍體解剖五决皆有記錄。五位生存的病人，皆尙在觀察中，已經過二至十個月的觀察不等。其餘一位祇開始受治療一個月。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>痧子療法的新開涮槪念</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>今年的痧子（又名麻疹）比往年特別多。新近有一位小學敎員吿訴我，他們學校裹的幼稚園內有過半數以上的小孩都患痧子，結果只有暫時停課了。</p>
<p>老年人常常在說：痧子是極普通的小孩病，人人都要出的，只要把房門窗子關緊，把帳子放下，防他受凉和防他見光，過了幾天就會好了，用不着請醫生的。」可是，我得吿訴讀者，在事實上痧子並不見得這樣輕鬆，我們耳頭耳尾往往可以聽見某人的小孩因為痧子中得着肺炎死了。又有某人的小孩因為痧子得着腦炎死了。至於痧子以後引起肺結核症的發作，那更是常見的事情由此看來，痧子並不是普通的傳染病、它是很需要我們小心處理的。</p>
<p>本來，一種傳染病的經過情形良好與吾多半以病者的身體能吾抵抗得住以及醫治方法之得宜與吾為標準，假使病者的身體好，抵抗力强，那末他雖然患着痧子却用不着醫生也會自然地痊好起來。假使他的身體雖然不很好，抵抗力不很强，可是因為醫治得法，那末他也可以痊好起來。不過，依我們的意思，總以强健身體和培植體內抵抗力為上。上海有許多做父母的人，他們老是担心着他們的孩子會患痧子，却不曉得怎樣去預先防範。其實他們平時假使能够稍為注意一下維他命一類的東西，那末豈止是痧子而已，我想其他的傳染病多少也可以防範吧。英國愛力生氏曾經在皇家病院中加以嚴密的統計，凡是在痧子以前或在痧十病中服用維他命A足量的孩子，他的痧子經過情形都很良好的。筆者在五年以來曾經在痧子病孩的經過期中給以大量的維他命A素，結果它的成績也非常良好。尤其對於肺結核方面（因為曾經患有肺門結核的小孩可以因痧子的發作而更加沉重，有時可以因此發生結核性的腦膜炎……即慢驚風一）這種大量維他命A素的給予更有很大的效力。</p>
<p>不過，我得提出一點來討論，雖則上述的維他命A素對於痧子有很大的帮助，可是患痧子的小孩有時往往可以得着很厲害的合併症，尤其是在痧子內陷的情形中，我們往往覺得非常棘手的。其實這箇痧子內陷是什麼原故呢？照我們的經騐所謂痧子的內陷即是痧子在出了少許之後忽然病者臉色和四肢發靑發紫，呼吸急促，全身暴噪不安，所有的痧子反爾都隱下去了。在醫學方面來說，這種症象是心臘衰弱和血液循環發生障礙的症象，是非常危險的。在中醫方面來說，他們是最怕遇着這種情形。而我們西醫呢，雖則有許多方法可以補救，可是有的時候往往還怕它來不及補救的。</p>
<p>自從第二次世界大戰之後各種科學都在突飛猛進。而在醫學方面呢，也有不少的新發明和新學理。即如痧子來說罷，現在又有新的理論了。我現在簡略地把它叙述如下：</p>
<p>原來所謂痧子的病症是和猩紅熱及紅疹等症相似的以皮膚方面的疹子來表現的傳染病症。雖則各種病症的病原菌不同，可是這幾種病菌都是直接去攻擊人身內全身的毛細血管的病症·每種病菌及其毒素都侵襲到毛細血管內，使這些毛細血管都給它破壞。假使破壞得厲害了。那末就發生出血現象。而這種出血倘使發生在表皮內，那末就是各種疹子，例如在痧子則為痧子疹，在猩紅熱則為猩紅熟疹。倘使出血現象發生在內臟呢，那末它就可以使內臟發炎，例如腎臟炎，氣管枝炎，腸粘膜炎之類。凡是患痧子的小孩很容易有咳嗽及腹瀉之類就是這箇原故。又在患猩紅熱或痧子之後，往往有臉腫眼皮腫甚而至於脚腫之類，這就是腎臟在裏內出血，也就是腎臟正在發炎的原故。假使內臟的出血情形太大了，那末所有的毛細血管都給它破壞，立刻就發生血液循環障碍，而心臟也隨之衰弱，那箇病者立即覺得氣悶胸塞，暴燥不安。假如救治不得其法，那末病者便心弱而死。這就是麻疹內陷，痧子發不出來的實在原因。</p>
<p>根據上述的這種原因，我們對於痧子的治法就須大大的改變了。我們為了要防止毛細血管（即人身內任何一處的最小血管）的被病菌或病菌的毒素破壞起見，我們得在病前或在病中給予大量的失血劑，尤其以維他命PP及維他命K，以及維他命C三種為最要。不管是內服抑或是注射，它的效用差不多都是相同的。假使是在病中，那末以注射的方式使用更妥。筆者在最近的臨診實騐由覺得用上述的方法非常有效。因此不憚煩特地介紹於此。</p>
<p>不過，我得再補充一則：假使遇着痧子內陷，症象非常險惡的時候，往往單用强心劑是不够的（强心劑中以樟腦劑，副腎腺素及加非精為最有效），那末可以熱水浴的法子（熱水須有攝氏。三十七或三十八度的溫度），往往有驚人的效用。</p>
<p>此外，關於痧子的治療及預防方面還有胎盤素，病人血淸，母體血淸之類。那些都是每個醫者都熟知的法子，恕我不再資述了。我以為上述的防止毛細血管出血的療法不但對於醫治者很有介紹的價値，即如那些家有小孩的讀者們，能够曉得曉得也未嘗無所裨益的。假使在未病之前能够服用些維他命PP之類，那末也許可以避免,許多的出血症象吧！</p>

<p>梵·谷訶（Vincent　Van　Gogh）是十九世紀的狂熱火才畫家，他的畫有火一樣的熱情，充滿了力的奔馳與熱情的旋律。一八五三年生於荷蘭，三十歲後才開始作畫，生性奔放潑辣，喜用澧烈的色彩，生動的筆觸描寫農民，野人，瘋人等樸素的顏面，率直的行為，更喜在火一般的日光下表現大字宙景物的絢爛，一八九〇年因熱情的泛濫而自殺，近代畫壇認為十九世紀的怪傑。</p>
<p>高更（Paul　Gaugin）與塞尙，谷訶同為後期印象派三大家，一八四八年生於巴黎，家貧，曾充航海船員。迨專攻繪畫，生性怪癖，憎惡都巿文明的虛偽，羨慕蠻人的天真與自然；後飄流到雨太平洋的泰依提（Tahite）島，娶土人為妻，蓄髪鬚，過原始人生活。以島上風物作題材，用簡單而又笨拙的綫與色，表現原始質樸的對象，在近代的畫面上，開拓了新的境界與新的生活。</p>
<p>亭利。瑪諦斯（Henri　Matlsse）是現代野獸主養繪畫的領袖，純法蘭西的畫家。生於一八六〇年，初學於摩羅（Moreau），迨研究恩格爾（Jngres）陀米埃（Danmier），取法於秀拉（Sural）特加（Deges）高更等繪畫後，更從黑人彫刻的暗示,闡發車純化的原理，始達近代綜合藝術的單純化繪畫。又研究塞尙的寫實性，把握繪畫的實在感,踏破舊有一切的法則，直接地表現熱情的迸發，使畫面構成綜合的美，用電一樣的綫條，花一般的色彩，十足地表現出瑪諦斯淸灑的獨自性，現尙健在，作品更遠爐火純靑的境地了。</p>
<p>舉迦索（Pablo　Picasso)立體主義的領導者，一八八一年生於西班牙，幼時即愛好繪畫，十四歲那年，榮譽地接受了巴爾賽羅拿展覽會的三等獎，初到巴黎，還沒有驚人的特點，其後追從浴德萊的作風，她表示着顯著的傾同。自從發現葛樓谷（Greco）以後，那畫中的人物，在青綠的色彩把握了悲愴的感覺。一九一七年，他轉回到新古典主義運動，所描的人物，具有豐滿的肉感，澀味的紅色，一換昔日面目，在巴黎畫壞上獲得非常的大名。他是一個創造力極强的畫家，作風屢易，現尙健在巴黎。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　176</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>至于w君，只要看看他那鳳尾魚角上幾條細紋，所含的笑意，就知他對干這個塲面上的一切，他都瞭如掌紋，他知道這時並不需要他說話；他一開口，把鶴見說話的機會躭擱了，必定增加鶴見的窘迫；所以他僅僅坐在那裏，欣賞着鶴見給他的那隻烟捲的特殊香味；默默地候着鶴見，如何解開這隻巧連環。</p>
<p>「哦」！鶴見臉上起了一陣紅暈，表示因為自己的誤會受了窘；但他並不像普通人那樣護短，為了顧全面子，咬矢橛式的堅持到底，這一「哦」表示他已經明白自己的誤會；「耀小姐的話，也許我沒有聽明白，所以我誤會了……」！他沉吟了一下，「關于萍子的志趣問題，到現在為止，我還有些拿不定……。</p>
<p>「您大家都知道」，鶴見把說話的對象，從耀羣一人，擴展到我們幾個人的範團上了；「萍子是幹着特務工作，這是無可疑盧的了。並且，她的手法，技能，和她所處境地的玄妙，都在最上上乘上，不能拿普通眼光和角度去衡量她。這最上上乘的境地，可以說極其微妙，微妙得無法斷定她的趨向，更無法捉摸她的動機；也許只有靑木長老一人心下明白。我很拘歉……」！</p>
<p>這一段自白，把鶴見的僵局果然打開了。他所表現的，是一片坦白。這呌我想到英國那句俗諺，「坦直為上」！凡事有了奸巧欺詐，勢必愈弄愈糟。</p>
<p>「我很抱歉」！鶴見躊躇得很似的，「萍子究竟為什麼呌我注意這個「八」之秘密。除非……可惜……」！</p>
<p>「除非怎樣？……可惜什麼？……」誰羣担憂的程度加深了。</p>
<p>「……」鶴見還在躊躇。</p>
<p>「除非設法盤間萍子，……可惜她不在這裏……」。我從旁邊替鶴見答覆了。</p>
<p>「我怕這個『八』裏面，還有更大的機密」。w君終于把他的心事說出來了。</p>
<p>「假如萍子在這裏，她……」？耀羣的話不曾說完，倐又停止了，也許她又想着別的一個問題了。</p>
<p>「您是說，她未必肯說話」？鶴見問精羣。</p>
<p>「是……剛才隊長說，這個「八」裏面，怕還有更大的機密，不是八個先頭秘密站，也不是您剛才發見的那八個大區，也不是八號的特工……如是一個豆大的機密，我害怕萍子一人，也未必全體吸瞭……那也可以暫時不管。我只要知道，您誰讓萍子說眞話嗎……」？</p>
<p>「沒有多大把握，只能試試看」。鶴見的眉尖，更縐在一起了。</p>
<p>「要是她來了，我倒有一個辦法」！我輕輕地抓了一句口。</p>
<p>「噢」？屋子裏的幾個人，都　詫起來。</p>
<p>「眞的嗎，岳先生？」嬥葉驚裏帶着幾分喜。</p>
<p>「大哥……？鶴見也有些信不及。</p>
<h3>繪畫印刷版的新力量</h3>
<p>— 王挺琦</p>
<p>—為上海美專助學會「世界名畫展覽」作</p>
<p>說「文學」的力量比「繪畫」大，在過去似乎不能否認，因為只要看得文字，便可以欣賞文學，而且一部著名作可印刷萬千份。但繪　原作，即使再有了挺好的拷貝，也無論如何不能比上印刷的文字，因而過去的繪書還得賴藉文字來解釋，來傳播。好得印象主義繪畫以上的繪畫與文學關係較多，譬如描寫聖經故事，文學故事，或者文學意味的風姿。但是近代的繪畫獨立起來了，而且迅速地走向純粹化，抽象化，音樂化的狀熊惟有繪畫的本身才能表現出創作的直意，所以近代繪畫特別覺到傳播的力量太微弱了，另一方面，要想懂得近代畫家的作品更其困難了。今天，這種困難也就快要過去，已經在歐美得到了解決，便是繪畫印刷版的進步，和大量的印出。</p>
<p>現在最好的畫片，其尺寸可與原作大小，油味，水味，以及各色彩的味道統可印出，筆觸的明顯厚薄和布紋的粗細都好像不是印刷的，其與原作真真相差極小，這一進步，首先把歐美的雇用畫家在博物館作臨摹拷貝的工作打倒。並且產生了另一種現象，便是將印刷品帶到原作的前面做一番修理照相片的工作。</p>
<p>這次美專助學會所舉辦的「世界名畫展覽」確乎其有如讀原作的意義，雖然都是印刷品，我相信未來的繪畫界，將因此種展覽的廣泛舉行予愛好藝術者以時常接觸的機會，耳濡目染，大衆欣賞的程度自然提高，一切的文化也隨之而更上一層樓了。</p>

<p>— 汪東旭初</p>
<p>二九年秋張目寒夫婦，自靑城遊峨眉成蜀中紀遊一編，大千為之圖；越年餘，出示請題，率拈此解。翠竹屛及羅谷靈光，皆峨眉勝境也。</p>

<h3>歸來</h3>
<p>— 潘蘊芬</p>
<p>九年——漫長的歲月渡過了。</p>
<p>今天我又投入了曾經消失了我黃金時代最可寳貴的夢影的所在。一切的人，一切的事，一切的物，就是這裏的一草一木，也都有着親切之感。</p>
<p>望着殘冬的夕陽躱藏在大樹的後邊，我並不留下一毫茫然的感覺。</p>
<p>「夕陽將帶去了嚴冬的酷寒冷寂，凄淸，更帶去了人間的」切汚穢，自私，卑鄙，明晨初春的朝陽會給善良的人帶來了新的希望。……於是，我愉悅地笑着，跳着，彷彿置身在初春故鄕綠油油的田野間，一般——生趣，活躍，陽光，花朶，靑春，麥苗……一切都是生命的喜悅。</p>
<p>走向曾經逗留過的小山頂，我從聲地高唱着多年來埋藏在心底使人窒息的憤怒，恥辱，抑　。</p>
<p>在汨汨的流水邊，我低聲地傾訴着一長串悠長歲月裏的憂煩，沒有詩篇，沒有春天，到處充滿着對善良者的傷害人性的榨壓，是一頁灰黯的歷史，我差點兒墮落在都市紙醉金迷的沈淵，變成了一粒汚流中的渣澤。所幸沒有感染着庸俗氣息的靈魂，現在又甦醒了過來。萌芽的小草在向我點頭，枝頭的烏兒奏着悅耳的音樂，是在祝福人煩的新生，是在歡迎我的歸來？</p>
<p>我躺在春天河邊的綠茵上，田野間刻苦的農夫和忙常喘息着的老兵給我帶來了高遠的理想和崇高的信念：</p>
<p>「生命是不息的工作和爭鬥，沒有一種收穫不靠着耕耘」……我跳了起來，高　着，　美着。</p>
<p>「怎麼多年不回來了，是應該高興的故鄕沒有多大的改變吧？經過了多年的刦掠與蹂躪」冗長而沉重的聲音，把我從幻想中喚醒過來。</p>
<p>「噢，老伯，沒有——」</p>
<p>「不冷嗎，站在西風中裏邊去吧！」經他一提醒，我頓時感到無邊的寒冷侵襲着全身，原來現在還不是春天呢，龜裂的土地，冰凍的河水，荒凉的村野，一顆顆樸實的心都被現實的軍糧，抽丁……的字樣衝碎。</p>
<p>「漫長的歲月渡過了，以後呢？還是茫然呀！」我聽到父老們在嘆息。</p>
<p>深夜，燭，不斷地流着淚，伴着人影在黑暗中搖曳冷風，大雨打着窗扉，倚着太親切的桌子想起了已成陳蹟的過去。……</p>
<p>「朴，朴，朴，……」敲更的聲音震盪了我的心弦，趕忙推開窗戶，微弱的燈燭光中那張瘦削蒼白的臉，真是太熟悉了。九年的遠離，一切都沒有改變，祗是更瘦了，更瘦！</p>
<p>是三更了嗎？我忽然醒覺過來，黑夜快過盡了？</p>
<p>「世間絕不會有過不盡的黑夜，冬日，…」眞的，在這「朴，朴，朴，……」的敲更聲中，我聽到了黎明的預言，春天的召喚。</p>
<p>「你該祝福呀？……」謝謝你，偉大的敲更者，你敲醒了無數黑夜裏摸索的人，願你敲得更響一點，把迷惘者都騖醒過來。</p>
<p>「我是歸來了？」這樣親切的聲音，景物？眞的，惟有在這太熟悉的地方，太親切的聲音裏，過份樸實，敦厚，溫暖的人情裏，我是應該高興的。</p>
<h3>小詩二章</h3>
<p>— 飛鴻</p>
<p>餛飩</p>
<p>妳自然滿腹委屈，</p>
<p>纔被人任意揉揑，</p>
<p>又被遺棄在沸水裏；</p>
<p>幾次起伏，</p>
<p>妳已皺紋滿面。</p>
<p>深巷</p>
<p>高樓上露出一絲微光，</p>
<p>賣卜者過去了，</p>
<p>賣餛純的還停着，</p>
<p>篤篤篤……。</p>
<h3>散文二題</h3>
<p>— 克人</p>
<p>山澗</p>
<p>春天，山澗掙脫嚴冬底桎梏而琮琮鳴唱起來，載着冰屑枯枝一道流去；水沫噴吐淸，跳躍着，粼波洄旋着朝兩岸湧去，似在低訴闊別後的溫存；而一問枯寂冷漠的谷壑，也因此帶來些許生氣了。</p>
<p>山澗並非寂寞的呵！羊九羣探首而啜飲了；那些白而整齊的巨齒貪戀地嗽洗着，間或嚥下幾口有着新鮮草香的澗水。漸漸也有農夫將黏滿泥巴的脚伸下來，草草洗櫂，附近的水面便攪起一片渾濁；山澗憎惡這個，於是流得更響喨了。</p>
<p>山澗所喜愛的乃是從技頭不時墜下的花朶，和偶然從風底翅膀上捲落的柳絮；它溫柔地浮起這些，緩緩流去；停住了，又蕩開去，山澗底波心是浪漫的。</p>
<p>還有，那些從莊子上偷偷跑來的姑娘們，曾匆促地臨流照過她們羞得發燒的臉龐兒呢。</p>
<p>因此每當我遠遠聽到山澗的輕吟，我心便洋溢着春天的喜悅。</p>
<p>星星</p>
<p>多少個寂寥的夜晚，母親抱起舉步未穩的幼小者，迎窗竚立着，指給他看那滿天閃燥的寒星：孩子蜷然伏在母親肩頭，濃黑的睫毛驚奇地貶動着；是最初　伏於宇宙的偉大與深奧嗎？但却在母親底呢語輕歌中漸漸入眠了：又息生　，母親所指的乃是她逝去的青春啊？</p>
<p>孩子長大來，承繼了母親所有的那份淡淡的憂　，夜裏往往獨自徘徊在星空下，思量着故鄉小戀人底那雙星也似的神秘的眼晴；現在他懂得，母親為什麼總歡喜默夢着星星了。</p>
<p>由於歲月的蹉跎，母親埀埀衰了：晚來窗前小立，已無溫馨的兒體在抱，而是遠方游子凄凉的影子幢幢在眼前。不知萬星爭輝的團圓日子，今生能否再有？想着想着，母親底淚光與星光交映了。</p>
<p>但屋星，却是與太空長存的。</p>
<h3>保護稅</h3>
<p>— 禮</p>
<p>貝當路公益號囤積大批食米，經抄獲二百三十五包，店主在逃，賬房被捕，供辭中說：「該號日前因囤米為某機關所發覺，當時行賄法幣六百萬元，及食米十二担了事。」並呈出一概證件。</p>
<p>這「一概證件」是證明些什麼呢？是證明從此該批囤米的合法嗎？報紙的記載語焉不詳，我仍不知道「某機關」是什麼機關，和囤米有什麼管轄上的關係，更不知該賬房招供時的語氣及態度，從「呈出一槪證件」一點上來看，是儼乎很理直氣壯的，雖然報上用的，是個「賄」字。</p>
<p>「賄」當然是不能「了事」的可是賬房被捕，呈案的可就是這些行賄得來的「證件」，這無論從正面或反面來看，囤積者的心目中，至少認為有了「機關」的「證件」，便算納了「保護稅」了，否則，明知行賄有罪，該賬房何不懼二罪併發，罪上加罪，而樂於「呈出一槪證件」來坐實他的罪案。</p>
<p>二百三十五包囤米而用十二祖食米和六百萬元法幣米作賄賂，折合志來，這筆保護稅幾乎是用了四分之一的代價了，用將本求利的眼光看，換得「一槪證件」以備他日事發呈案之用，原是頗為老到的，否則，又何貴乎有此「證件」？若說這些「證件」原為檢舉之用，則又何以呈案之日，却在囤米搜獲之後？</p>
<p>可見「證件」之為用，在他們是視乎「企圖高價出售」的一個保證，那也就是說，道「高價」中還得包括「百分之二十五」的保護稅及其盈利在內。</p>
<p>現在是囤米抄獲了，行賄的法幣和食米當然也不能就此「了事」人犯已經送往警備部「靜候法辦」，看來是還有後文的。</p>
<p>可是囤積居奇的把戲，是否就此絕跡呢？這還有待主管機構對類乎「某機關」的發落！</p>
<p>從淪陷時期一直到今天，囤積的奸商們從經騐中得一觀念，即是：若被發覺，行賄可也。而行賄之後，冥冥中就等於納了一筆保護稅而有了保障，待東窗事發，主管者為了牽涉太廣或家醜不可外揚，就也一切「了事」了。</p>
<p>不是嗎？今天的囤米者便抄了老文章，把行賄「一概證件」呈出來了，他們和「某機關」原已早就「了事」了的。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>財神失寶記</h3>
<p>— 楊墨素</p>
<p>財神廟裏的五路財神，召開圓桌會議，乘着社會經濟動盪，市面混亂之際，預備各路進攻，一致投機。第一路金面財神，首先发難，大量吸收黃金，無論金條，金塊，元寶，飾金等，一律囤進，吩咐于下爪牙「招財」和「進實」，一個忙着用秤稱「黃金萬兩」，一個忙着用斗量「日進斗金」。第二路白面財神看了眼紅，立刻跟進，囤積米糧，居奇操縱。第三路黑面財神不甘示弱，搜購美幣，不遺餘力，造成二萬比一的黑市局面。第四路文財神狂吸紗股，第五路武財神跟進统债，財神廟裏充滿暴發的氣象。一般窮百姓，抱着「近大富必小康」的信心，都趨炎附勢，爭到財神廟燒香，長錠元寶，賄賂公行，希望在菩薩面上沾點光，因此鬧得烏烟瘴氣，人心惶惶。那知惱怒了當地的城隍老爺，奉王帝之命，採取緊急措置，隨帶八名皂隸，扛抬着一把大算盤，親自出馬，趕到財神廟，和財神算賬。</p>
<p>五路財神起初以為「金錢萬能」，只要講些「人情」，應酬一番，便可不生問題，豈料城隍老爺鐵面無私，公事公辦。看見金面財神態度傲慢，目光勢利，首先和他算賬，撥動大算珠。「爾有千算，不及我一算」，九九八十一，黃金收歸庫有，埋入地窖，永不超昇，從此黃金變土，看你怎樣活動。白面財神一看苗頭不對，胆子本來最小，自動情願拿出囤米，照平價門市，售給民衆。惟黑而財神因為從前到過外洋，會說洋話，身邊又有一隻黑處，吃相難看，城隍老爺把算珠一撥，說聲好罷，美幣今起官價一萬二，黑面財神有苦說不出，也發不出甚麼成風來。城隍老爺回過頭來，却不見了文武二財神，忙問招財進寶，據答剛才老爺和三位財神主子算賬的時候，他們二位化裝了窮百姓樣子，偷偷地溜出廟門外面去了。城隍老爺大為震怒，想了一想，說：辦法有了，把他倆的眞名實姓，登報公吿，通緝嚴辦。招財進寶，改業謀生，驅逐出廟，吩咐卓　把廟門封釘，廟產充公，門前匾額上「財神廟」三個斗大金字，各塗去半邊，成為「才申月」，諸事完畢，打道回宮，從前　香的老百姓，行經此地，頭也不敢高抬，齊　說道，這樣措置，「才」　替窮百姓「申二口氣咧</p>

<h3>愛的對話</h3>
<p>— 孔源</p>
<p>任何人，不論中外古今，不論男女老少，最感興趣的問題是什麼？</p>
<p>如果你這樣問我，我將毫不思索地回答你一個字！「愛」。</p>
<p>你看過柏拉圖的「愛的座談會」？</p>
<p>這位希臘偉大的哲人，以戲剛的形式，用精美的文句，把無限的智慧和歡欣，極詩意地解釋了愛的眞諦。</p>
<p>我願向他學習。</p>
<p>你可別以為找有太多的戀愛故事。</p>
<p>每年的情人節，我總是孤單地在斗室裏日夜徘徊。</p>
<p>今年的情人節·我向自己期誦了一首文改作的詩：</p>
<p>「前不見春花，後不見秋月；念愛情之悠悠，獨捫聚而涕下一。</p>
<p>你不會嘲笑我？你也許記得泰戈爾說過：</p>
<p>「如果世界上沒有花，你才眞能了解對花的愛」。</p>

<h3>Nineteen Counties in Shandong Province Given a Deadline to Recover; National Army Continues to Recapture Jiaxiang Yesterday; Communist Troops in Zouxian and Tengxian Show Signs of Wavering</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng paid a visit to the Chairman at 11:00 am on the 20th to report on matters. Chen has been feeling slightly unwell recently and will not leave Nanjing in the short term.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Chief of Staff Chen reported to Chairman Chiang that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line may be opened within a few weeks or possibly before March 1st, allowing direct train service between Shanghai and Tianjin. Observers say this will have a direct impact on China's economy, both practically and psychologically.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 20th] The Shandong Provincial Government convened a meeting on the 20th of leading members from the Party, government, and organizations from nineteen counties in southwestern Shandong, including Dingtao, Jiaxiang, and Yixian. The meeting stipulated that all relevant staff return to their respective counties immediately to rebuild local armed forces, stabilize the area, and begin recovery work. The provincial government will provide all transportation.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 20th] The National Army recaptured Jiaxiang at 4:00 pm on the 20th. The National Army, having recaptured Zaozhuang, is advancing towards Tengxian. The National Army advancing towards Feixian is eight to nine kilometers from the city suburbs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th] After the National Army recaptured Linyi, Commissioner Wang Hongjiu and County Magistrate Zhu Shaobai immediately led their troops into the city to carry out pacification work. Communist organizations are rapidly disintegrating. Local elders celebrated and the people voluntarily turned in large quantities of grain and military supplies stored by the Communists.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 20th] The National Army in southern Shandong, Linyi, and Yixian, sent a division to support the city on the 18th. The remnant troops of Zhang Guangzhong, the commander of the Communist Southern Shandong Military Region, numbering over ten thousand, are currently based near Sangcun, north of Zaozhuang, attempting to flee north. The National Army advancing north from Lincheng has reached the outskirts of Tengxian.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 20th] The Shandong Military Region Headquarters of the Communist Southern Shandong Military Region issued the following strategy for the current situation: (1) Use large-scale guerrilla warfare and small-scale mobile warfare to contain the National Army's forces. (2) Attack towns behind the enemy lines to establish new base areas. (3) Utilize the National Army's lenient policy by sending lower-level cadres to infiltrate the National Army's recaptured areas for covert operations. (4) Carry out assassinations and looting behind the National Army lines to create a state of terror.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The war situation in Shandong is gradually developing along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. After the National Army in southern, western, and central Shandong clears out the remaining Communist troops in their respective areas, they are adopting a multi-pronged approach to capture Chen Yi, who is trapped in the Yimeng Mountains. Furthermore, the National Army in Shandong recaptured Jiaxiang on the afternoon of the 20th and shook hands with Wu Huawen's troops, who had been fighting alone for one year and three months between Yanzhou and Jining. The Communist troops in Zouxian and Tengxian are now caught in a pincer movement by the National Army from the north and south and are in a state of extreme panic.</p>
<h3>National Army in Eastern Henan Enters Sizhou; Communist Base Area of Mengxian in Shanxi Recaptured; The Baoding-Shijiazhuang Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Will Soon Be Opened</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] The remnant troops of Liu Bocheng in eastern Henan, numbering over four thousand, were routed by the National Army on the 19th and fled north across the railway from the Chai River area. At the same time, the Communist troops in the Qixian area have also been cleared out, and the National Army has entered Qixian city.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 20th] A telegram from Taiyuan reports that the National Army in Shanxi, following the recapture of Xiyan Town, recaptured Mengxian on the 19th, a base area of the Communist troops for nine years.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 20th] According to reports from relevant authorities, strong units of the National Army in Shijiazhuang recaptured Dongchangshou on the 19th without encountering much resistance from the Communist troops and continued to advance north. The Communist troops in Dongchangshou and Xinle continued to retreat to both sides of the railway. Railway repair teams are following the army to repair the railway. Trains from Shijiazhuang can reach Dongchangshou in two to three days.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 20th] News from Shijiazhuang indicates that the National Army in Baoding has advanced south, and it is rumored that Wangdu, the third station south of Baoding, has been recaptured by the National Army, but this has not yet been confirmed. After the second battle of Yixian and Xushui in the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the Communist troops have voluntarily switched from an offensive to a defensive posture. The opening of the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section is inevitable. However, the authorities of the Eleventh War Zone may adopt a cautious approach and wait for the forces from southern Shandong to enter Hebei to open the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway in one go.</p>
<h3>Chairman Orders the Economic Commission to Supervise Economic Measures; Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After the promulgation of the emergency economic measures, it is reported that the Chairman personally ordered the Central Economic Policy Research Committee to be responsible for supervising and implementing them effectively. Upon receiving the order, the committee immediately convened a meeting on the 20th to discuss practical supervisory methods.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, and Xu Kan will travel to Shanghai again by train on the night of the 20th to handle various issues related to finance and commodity prices.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Pang Songzhou, Xu Baiyuan, and others traveled to Shanghai on the evening of the 20th in the same train as Wang Yunwu and others to jointly supervise the implementation of the emergency economic measures plan with Song Ziwen and to discuss several pending issues. They are expected to return to Nanjing in two to three days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Xu Kan said on the evening of the 20th that the general situation since the implementation of the emergency economic measures plan has been good. If all parties can implement it effectively and cooperate with each other, it will not be difficult to achieve the desired results. Xu believes that there is no reason to be pessimistic about the current economic situation and said that the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics is discussing detailed methods for balancing the budget with the Executive Yuan, which will be formulated soon. The main purpose of this move is to reduce non-urgent expenditures.</p>
<h3>The Economic Policy Research Committee Will Be Subordinate to the National Defense Commission</h3>

It is reported that the committee will become a semi-permanent institution, the number of members will be increased, and it will be subordinate to the National Defense Commission. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 pm.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Food Discussed Food Supply Issues Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Senior officials of the Ministry of Food held an important meeting on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss how to ensure that the food section of the "Daily Necessities Supply Regulations" can be implemented as planned. It is reported that the current need is to investigate the total number of government employees and factory workers who need to be supplied with rice and flour under the "Daily Necessities Supply Regulations" in order to determine the total amount of supply and to make more appropriate preparations in terms of transportation and distribution methods. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Food, the Ministry's food reserves are extremely abundant and sufficient to meet current needs. If the distribution methods are meticulous, there is no need to worry about the people's food supply.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the technical issues of supplying daily necessities, the Executive Yuan is scheduled to convene representatives from all relevant parties on the 21st to discuss them. The Yuan convened personnel from relevant agencies at 10:00 am today to discuss the price assessment rules. Jiang Menglin, Wang Yunwu, Pang Songzhou, Chen Kewen, Xie Zhengfu, and others attended, and the rules were immediately revised and passed and sent to the National Defense Council for record.</p>
<h3>The Guangzhou Authorities Pay Attention to Preventing Funds from Fleeing to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] Since the government implemented the emergency economic measures plan, economic figures here believe that Hong Kong is a major loophole, and speculative capital will flow to Hong Kong in large quantities. At least dozens of people go to Hong Kong every day to join the Hong Kong gold and silver trading market. The authorities have increased the number of military police along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to strictly prevent speculative capital from fleeing to Hong Kong, but smugglers are still rampant. It is widely believed that the flow of speculative capital to Hong Kong will inevitably affect the rise in commodity prices there. Therefore, the Hong Kong government is paying close attention. If the Hong Kong government can strictly control commodity prices, this speculative capital may be invested in industrial real estate and stocks.</p>
<h3>Goods Hoarded in Xi'an Come Out; Prices of Grain, Yarn, and Cloth Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 20th] Since the emergency economic measures order was issued, goods hoarded for days have been released, and people's livelihood goods, including grain, yarn, and cloth, have continued to fall in price. Gold ornaments are inventoried by the provincial government at the original stores, pending handling by the central government. The provincial government announced five implementation measures, stipulating that in accordance with the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Chief of Staff of the First War Zone, the carrying of gold notes out of the designated counties in this province is prohibited. Some people believe that this is to prevent gold from flowing into Communist areas.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Holds a General Meeting to Review Economic Measures; It Is Believed That the Content of the Plan Still Needs to Be Improved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] At the 3-1 general meeting held by the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 20th, the legislators made objective and serious criticisms of the emergency economic measures plan, believing that there are still many areas that need to be reviewed and improved. Sun Ke presided over today's meeting of the Legislative Yuan. After discussing the draft Household Census Law and other proposals, Luo Ding, the convener of the Criminal Law Committee, reported. The Criminal Law, Finance, and Economic Committees reviewed the emergency economic measures plan on the 19th, explaining that the attendees unanimously agreed that only the penalty part of the plan was being discussed; however, the penalties are based on various measures, and the entire plan has a significant impact on the people's burden and freedom. If the entire plan is not reviewed, it would not be appropriate to decide on the penalty part.</p>
<p>Please Submit the Entire Plan to the Legislative Yuan for Review</p>
<p>After detailed discussion, it was decided to suggest to the Supreme National Defense Committee that the entire plan be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for resolution. Luo also explained that the government's past issuance of import and export subsidy measures did not complete the legislative procedures in advance, and now it has been abruptly abolished, which is legally inconsistent. In addition, the exchange rate has increased from 3,350 to 12,000. It seems necessary to hear an explanation of the basis for this. Finally, regarding the provisions on commodity prices and wages in the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period and the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities During the Emergency Period, it is worth considering whether the "emergency period" marked on them can still be applied one year after the Japanese surrender. Chen Guyuan said that it is inconsistent with the legislative procedure to only discuss the penalties without reviewing the entire plan. Situ De analyzed the plan in detail, believing that there are many questionable points. For example, changing the gold price to 4.8 million will affect the big players, but they have ways to deal with it. The most disadvantaged are the small citizens who are deeply afraid that the banknotes in their hands will continue to depreciate and eventually become worthless. They bought gold at high prices with their hard-earned savings, and this major change is a great loss. Although the government has drafted control measures for the circulation of US dollars, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no black market, and it may be difficult to eradicate the phenomenon of foreign exchange fleeing to Hong Kong. Zhang Jinyuan pointed out in a painful tone that the emergency measures plan has great drawbacks. The government used to sell gold at a price of 7-8 million, and now it wants to recover it at a price of 4.8 million, which is like digging a trap in advance and forcing the people to jump in. The situation with the US dollar is also the same. The government admitted a large number of self-funded students half a year ago. At that time, the official price of the US dollar was still 3,350. The students repeatedly applied, but the government did not allow it until the exchange rate was adjusted to 12,000. It is painful to talk about! The penalty part of the emergency plan also has great drawbacks. For example, prohibiting the circulation of gold will inevitably cause various inconveniences and hardships to the people during implementation. Situ De spoke again, hoping that the administrative authorities would have the courage to admit their mistakes and not blame others or make the people suffer for their own mistakes. Zhong Tianxin said that the most popular part of the emergency measures plan is the government's announcement to buy back the existing foreign currencies; however, why is this measure not purchased at a price of 3,350, as stipulated in the "Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange" for dealing with domestic banks' foreign exchange depositors, but at a price of 12,000? In addition, the purchase of overseas deposits must go through diplomatic channels and have meticulous arrangements. Now that all preparations have not been completed, it is equivalent to alerting the snake and allowing depositors to change accounts. The general meeting finally decided to follow the review opinions of the three committees and suggested to the National Defense Commission that the entire plan be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review to show solemnity.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, did not attend the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 20th, but sent a letter saying: "Due to matters in Shanghai, I cannot attend. I plan to attend the regular meeting of your Yuan on the 28th." The meeting decided that since the 28th is not the date of the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan, a temporary meeting will be held on March 1, and Mr. Song will be invited to report to the Yuan.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Punishing Violations of Price Limits and Price Agreements</h3>

<h3>Our Government's Suggestions to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA): Machinery Exchange for Cotton and Wheat for Transportation to China; Rejection of Allegations Regarding Sale of Supplies; Remarks by Mr. Rooks</h3>
<p>[Washington, D.C., U.S. News Agency, 19th] UNRRA Director General Mr. Rooks issued a statement today, saying that the UNRRA Central Committee will soon convene a meeting to discuss the proposals put forward by the Chinese government. The Chinese government had made several suggestions to the UNRRA personnel stationed in China, one of which was to request a change in part of UNRRA's plan in China, to focus on consumer goods such as cotton and wheat. This request is just one of the suggestions under consideration by UNRRA. It will prompt UNRRA to transport cotton and wheat worth 200 million US dollars to China, abandoning the original step of transporting machinery and other materials to China. The Chinese government believes that the encouragement this type of basic supply may bring to China's economy and currency system is greater than UNRRA's current plan. Rumors that the Chinese side intends to request permission to sell UNRRA supplies on the black market are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Selling UNRRA's supplies locally through legal channels does not violate UNRRA's policy. UNRRA's general policy is to continue relief and rehabilitation plans, so that UNRRA's plan is a dual relief. The money from selling a loaf of bread made from UNRRA wheat to someone who can afford it is enough to offset the distribution cost of giving another loaf of bread for free to someone who cannot afford it.</p>
<p>Daily necessities transported to a receiving country should be distributed under careful rationing and price controls, so that everyone has an equal opportunity to obtain their due share. This is also one of UNRRA's general policies. Therefore, UNRRA's policy avoids priority or discrimination, regardless of whether such discrimination or priority is based on a person's financial status or other conditions. The distribution problem in China is particularly difficult, as China has a vast territory and has suffered greatly from eight years of war and two years of internal strife. Due to the lack of domestic transportation equipment and losses from the war, the cost of distributing UNRRA supplies in China is far higher than in other countries, and is extremely large. The actual distribution problem is further aggravated by the long distances, the fragmentation of the domestic transportation network, and areas of open warfare. At the same time, due to economic devastation and many government difficulties, China has failed to establish an administrative organization to implement an effective rationing system or control the prices of scarce resources. Due to the above factors, the work of distributing UNRRA supplies within China has become an extremely complex problem. Unlike other recipient countries, China has not obtained sufficient funds from the sale of UNRRA supplies to be used for distribution. As a result, the distribution costs must be supported by direct appropriations from the Chinese government, which is not only a major expenditure of the Chinese government's financial resources, but also contributes to China's inflation. "UNRRA authorities deeply understand this problem and are doing their utmost to overcome various difficulties. The Chinese government's suggestions on this issue are just one of the steps in this regard. The entire issue will be studied by the Central Committee, and it is hoped that a way can be found to promote the UNRRA plan for the benefit of all the people of China."</p>
<h3>New York Chinese News Agency Announces: No Request to UNRRA; Zheng Bin-nan Points Out Errors in Rooks' Statement</h3>
<p>[New York, Central News Agency, 19th] The Chinese News Agency here issued a statement saying: Chinese official sources in Washington said that the recent rumors that China made a request to UNRRA are absolutely untrue. China requested an increase in the supply of cotton to China within the scope of UNRRA's China fund. Cotton is the most important commodity for manufacturing textiles, which is a basic need of the Chinese masses who have suffered from war for many years. Contrary to the rumor that the Chinese government intends to put UNRRA supplies into the black market, what must be pointed out is that the most important step taken by the Chinese government in the past few months to address the black market and inflation has been in the area of cotton yarn. In this regard, the Chinese government has been successful in using the above methods: (1) the cost of cotton yarn in factories is sold to the unified planning agency, which resells it to legitimate distributors at a limited price; (2) imported cotton is directly allocated to cotton mills to eliminate speculation. The success of this method has apparently stabilized textile prices to a considerable extent before the recent financial crisis occurred. According to the economic emergency measures recently announced in Nanjing, yarn and cloth prices must continue to be stabilized. In order to achieve this goal, a continuous supply of cotton should be guaranteed, and the effective methods used in the past to combat the black market and crack down on speculation should be actively maintained.</p>
<p>[Washington, Central News Agency, United Press, 19th] Chinese official sources here have disputed part of Rooks' statement. Zheng Bin-nan, director of the Chinese Executive Yuan's Washington office, said that Rooks' statement that China had "implied" that it wanted to sell supplies on the free market was incorrect. Zheng was supported by other Chinese officials.</p>
<h3>Huo Bao-shu Solemnly Refutes Rumors</h3>
<p>[This City, Central News Agency] The United Press has published news for several days, claiming that the Chinese government would request that 200 million yuan of UNRRA relief supplies be sold at black market prices in order to obtain cash and overcome China's currency crisis. Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Director Huo Bao-shu yesterday firmly denied the United Press's report and said: The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has never requested UNRRA to change the contract. It is even more impossible to say that it requested to exchange all relief supplies for sale on the market. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration absolutely denies having such a request. In the past, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had suggestions regarding the supplies that UNRRA transported to China, requesting that more suitable supplies be transported to China, but no spokesperson was heard to have said anything about the above-mentioned incident. (Note: Regarding our request to sell UNRRA supplies, President Song has already stated yesterday that there is no such thing. Now Director Huo has also made this statement, and the rumors can be dispelled.)</p>
<h3>UNRRA Has Transported More Than 1.5 Million Tons of Supplies to China</h3>
<p>[This City] UNRRA announced that UNRRA has transported a total of 1,557,277 tons of supplies to China so far. 13,255 tons of supplies were transported to China last week. In addition, there are 125 UNRRA ships carrying 261,251 tons of supplies on their way to China.</p>
<h3>Jackson Returns to Shanghai from Qingdao; Flies to Hong Kong and Transfers to the United States at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>

<h3>Philippine Foreign Minister Replies to Our Note, Expressing Willingness to Resume Negotiations; Unwilling to Concede on Two Points of Criticism</h3>
<p>[Manila, United Press, 20th] Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino has replied today to the note from Chinese Envoy to the Philippines Chen Zhi-ping regarding the suspension of negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship, firmly asserting that the Philippine government is prepared to resume discussions. Regarding the two points raised in the Chinese note, attacking the Philippine government: (1) taking discriminatory actions against overseas Chinese during the negotiations; (2) revising parts of the draft that the Chinese side participating in the negotiations had already considered to have been agreed upon. Regarding the first point, Quirino said: The preferential rights of public market vendors have been granted by the government to Philippine nationals, "This is a privilege within the sovereignty of the government, a legitimate right granted to citizens of a country." The Philippine government has delayed this decree, postponing the nationalization of stalls for more than sixty years, but also stated: This action is now imperative due to the economic needs of the Filipinos, and this plan is not aimed at the people of a particular country. Regarding the second point, Quirino replied: "This is a common practice. Before an agreement is formally passed, all drafts under negotiation can be changed. The Philippine government is sincere in its negotiations and is willing to continue negotiations with this sincerity, but the Philippines cannot subordinate the interests of its people to the will of other countries." Quirino solemnly stated: "The Philippine government is extremely sincere and willing to reach a complete agreement with the Chinese government on an appropriate treaty to express the traditional friendly relations between the two countries."</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The Suzhou Provincial Government urgently telegraphed the Suzhou County Government on the 20th, stating that although the rice market has been calm recently, it has not yet seen a decline, and that rice merchants are intentionally waiting and seeing. It ordered the county government to suppress grain prices by 5,000 yuan per stone day by day in accordance with the Shanghai method, and to ensure that the rice market is not only lower than Shanghai, but also lower than Wuxi on a daily basis. After receiving the order, the Suzhou County Government convened an emergency meeting of the Provisional Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Grain Association at 4 pm.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Comprehensively Plans to Make Up for the Financial Deficit</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang] The Jiangsu Finance Department previously estimated that this year's expenditures would be 72 billion yuan, but tax revenue would only be 32 billion yuan, a shortfall of nearly 40 billion yuan. Moreover, the number of business expenses listed was still limited, and there were no large sums of money to subsidize poor counties and cities. The amount of the living subsidy reserve was not large, and future expenditures would be even greater if benefits were adjusted again and again. In order to remedy the situation, it was requested that the central government subsidize 24 billion yuan, but it has not yet been approved. Therefore, the deficit in the budget cannot be adjusted without comprehensive planning. The Provincial Provisional Council resolved to request the central government to return the 30% of the land tax that should be obtained to the provincial level, and to adjust the tax rate, collect legal tender, abolish the collection of actual objects and borrowing, and allocate half of the land tax collected to the province and counties, so as to make up for the financial deficit.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How Should the Economic Plan Be Advanced?</h3>
<p>Complex situations must be resolved with complex means. In particular, the current economic problems, which are intricate and resemble a cluster of simultaneous illnesses, cannot be fully resolved by a simple method or plan. Such expectations are ultimately close to wishful thinking.</p>
<p>The Economic Emergency Measures Plan passed by the National Defense Council this time is extremely complex in content. It has clear provisions on all items such as gold, US dollars, foreign exchange, wages, prices, overseas deposits, and salaries of civil servants. In terms of nature and scope, it can be described as comprehensive and very different from the measures announced in previous resolutions. However, even with this plan, there are still many areas that should be supplemented or amended. For example, how should the buying and selling of ornamental gold be regulated? How should the implementation of rationing and the transfer of state-owned enterprises be prepared? How should the declaration of overseas deposits be effectively planned to make it effective? These are all obvious matters.</p>
<p>In addition to the above points, we feel that there are several key points that must be prepared immediately and implemented quickly to avoid losing the expected effect.</p>
<p>1. Promoting Export Goods. The most meaningful effect of this exchange rate increase is naturally to promote exports and restrict imports. However, judging from the experience of implementing export subsidies on the sixth of this month, it is very obvious that the beneficiaries are none other than hoarders who have goods in hand. Because those who are truly engaged in export are not necessarily the owners of the goods, and the farmers who directly produce and the manufacturers who process them have probably already sold them off in desperation under the pressure of high-interest loans. If they are resold again and again like kicking a ball, profiting from them, the effect of the exchange rate increase will inevitably be offset by such transfer transactions. In the short two or three days, the market price of general local goods has been rising slowly. Such profit-seeking activities cannot be effectively addressed by empty words of persuasion or forced coercion. In our view, if the real purpose is to promote exports, then the method of the public sector purchasing and then reselling them is still worthy of consideration. Moreover, this method should be implemented as soon as possible, and the opportunity must not be missed. If the price increase is too fast and completely offsets the benefits obtained from foreign exchange, then it will be impossible to start.</p>
<p>2. Price Control. To stabilize prices and maintain production, first stabilize wages at the level of January of this year. To stabilize life and maintain livelihoods, effectively control prices and prevent them from rising. This is naturally very well-rounded in theory and procedure. There are four measures: first, to implement quantitative distribution to workers based on the retail prices in January; second, to supply daily necessities to civil servants; third, to implement price limits on daily necessities in various places; and fourth, to implement control over general goods in accordance with the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During Extraordinary Periods. Simply put, it is to suppress wages by stabilizing prices, and then suppress prices by restricting wages. If this chain system can be effectively implemented and not disconnected, it is naturally something that everyone deeply desires. What we are concerned about is: (1) Whether various rationed goods can be supplied on schedule and in the required quantities. We cannot but hope that the competent authorities will correct the bad habits of the past, such as shirking responsibility, perfunctory performance, profiteering, and slow pace, and strive to take on this major responsibility. (2) The control matters should be implemented effectively without being harsh or disruptive. We cannot but sincerely hope that the competent authorities will recognize their responsibilities and seek legal and reasonable ways from the painful experiences of past failures.</p>
<p>3. Combating Smuggling. This issue was not addressed in the emergency plan. However, the higher the exchange rate and the more difficult it is to import, the greater the profit from smuggling. The consequences are: (1) Imports still cannot be restricted; (2) A portion of the normal tariff revenue is lost; (3) The black market for US dollars cannot be eliminated; (4) A portion of remittances from overseas Chinese is offset; and (5) Legitimate import businesses become more and more unfavorable. Therefore, to achieve the effect of restricting imports, in addition to strictly reviewing foreign exchange settlements, we hope that the government will take further and effective measures to deal with smuggling.</p>
<p>4. Prohibition of Gold and Currency. This measure has already been seen in practice. The inspection of financial institutions and the capture of illegal buying and selling are being intensified. Jewelry stores in various places have also closed down as a result. We believe that this passive measure can easily achieve considerable results. However, people are driven by profit. What will they not do? Dealing with some petty vendors is a small matter, but how to eradicate this trend and ensure that gold and currency will indeed not cause trouble in the future is a very important matter. Because the mortgage of gold is still regarded as legal today, it has attracted the attention of the world, and rent, warehouse fees, and salaries have always been paid in US dollars. Whether this type of illegal transfer can be completely stopped in the future depends on the determination of the authorities.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "Mere goodness is not sufficient for government, and mere laws cannot carry themselves into effect." To make the entire economic plan truly effective and to prevent it from causing harm, the key lies entirely in personnel. Some people suspect that the efficiency of the administration is too low and may not be able to handle such complex economic affairs. This is not without reason. However, as society evolves, the economic component contained in politics increases. In extraordinary times, it is indeed necessary to adopt the above measures, and even in times of peace, it is impossible to return to non-interference and complete laissez-faire. Therefore, the preconditions for promoting economic policies, namely personnel and organization, are only those that the government hopes to pay close attention to and strive to improve in order to cooperate with this unprecedented economic plan.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Suddenly Agrees to International Supervision of Atomic Energy Plants: Gromyko's Surprising Statement Deserves Great Attention</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: Before the Security Council resumed its discussion on atomic energy control today, Soviet Representative Gromyko claimed that the Soviet Union would allow international organizations to supervise and manage Soviet atomic energy manufacturing plants at any time. Gromyko had previously proposed amendments to the US plan, limiting monitoring to manufacturing plants that existed at the time of signing a world atomic energy treaty. The United Nations is optimistic about Gromyko's statement, believing that the US and the Soviet Union are gradually approaching this issue. At the same time, it is reported that the United States' largest atomic research laboratory, covering more than 3,600 acres, will be built southwest of Chicago in Illinois, with millions of US dollars in funding. It is named the "Argonne National Laboratory" and managed by the University of Chicago, but this is only one of several atomic laboratories planned to be established.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Thomas, the Deputy Director of a certain US atomic test plant, declared today at the Senate Atomic Energy Committee that the basic principles of manufacturing atomic bombs have long been known by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France. Geologists should first go to the Soviet Union to determine the importance of sodium and thorium mines in its territory.</p>
<h3>Wavell's Removal Approved, Mountbatten Appointed Indian Viceroy: Rumors of UK-India Defense Alliance, UK Announces Power Transfer to Indians Before Next Summer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 20th Broadcast: Attlee declared in the House of Commons that the British government would transfer power to the Indians as late as June 1948.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: After British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel, met with Secretary of State Marshall for 35 minutes, he told reporters that Indian Viceroy Wavell had resigned and that Mountbatten would succeed him.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] According to authoritative sources, the British government has telegraphed Indian Viceroy Wavell to return home. Prime Minister Attlee is preparing to make an important statement in the House of Commons at 4:15 this afternoon, announcing the progress of India towards freedom and independence. According to some sources, it is possible that Britain will withdraw from India within a specified period, with a maximum period of one year. If British forces are determined to withdraw within a certain period, the Indian issue will be left to the Indians to resolve themselves. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, hundreds of British officials and thousands of other personnel are preparing to return home next month.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 20th] It is rumored that Marshal Mountbatten will replace Wavell as Indian Viceroy. Observers say that when Viceroy Wavell took office, the military situation was critical. Now that the situation has changed, there is reason to replace him with a new person.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] It is learned that Marshal Mountbatten will replace Wavell as Indian Viceroy, and that British troops in India are scheduled to withdraw in June 1948. Mountbatten's mission in the future will be to ensure that India remains a member of the British Commonwealth or at least forms a close military alliance with Britain.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The British Labor Party delegation held a closed meeting today to discuss the Palestine issue. The Foreign Secretary and Colonial Secretary Jones vigorously defended the government's policy and its decision to submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations.

<p>Zionist Faction</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] A spokesman for the Zionist movement recently told our reporter that the main reason why the Zionist movement refused the British proposal to resolve the Palestine issue was that these proposals followed the British government's White Paper issued in 1939 and prevented Jews from returning to Palestine, which led to this situation.</p>

<h3>France and Poland Sign Cultural Agreement, Alliance Negotiations to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] Since France and Poland signed a cultural agreement this morning, it has been learned from well-informed sources that all signs are sufficient to prove that the friendly relations between France and Poland will be further strengthened and will not stop there. The two sides will soon revise the 1921 treaty and re-establish a political agreement, which is quite possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] It was recently announced here that France will negotiate an alliance treaty with Poland in accordance with the British-Soviet alliance treaty. Negotiations for France to conclude a similar alliance treaty with the Czech Republic are already underway. The goal of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to conclude alliances with Germany's neighboring countries to prevent Germany from re-invading. The alliance treaties between France and the Netherlands and Belgium are also under consideration, but active steps will not be taken to negotiate alliance treaties with the Netherlands and Belgium until the British-French alliance treaty is signed.</p>
<h3>UK-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations, Soviet Union Proposes Preconditions, Bevin Expresses Acceptance of This Proposal</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] Well-informed sources recently said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has proposed to Britain that the two countries should first reach an agreement on issues related to both parties' common interests, and then begin negotiations to revise the alliance treaty. Foreign Minister Bevin has expressed his acceptance of this proposal. The British Foreign Office has neither confirmed nor denied this statement, but it is said that Foreign Minister Molotov told British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Peterson, that he hoped to discuss the following four issues before conducting treaty revision negotiations with Britain: (1) World trade; (2) Access to raw materials; (3) Security zones of Britain and the Soviet Union around the world; (4) The future of "Ruodi."</p>
<p>It is heard that Foreign Minister Bevin has divided these general issues into three categories: (1) Maritime and inland water transportation; (2) Security issues in the Mediterranean and the Middle East; (3) Business relations.</p>
<h3>Draft of British-French Alliance Treaty, Differences in the Positions of the Two Countries</h3>
<p>French Opinion is More Realistic</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Well-informed sources say that the draft of the alliance treaty between Britain and France differs greatly in the proposal for taking joint action to resist Germany's future aggression. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is studying the British draft. It is said that the British draft states that the two countries will only take joint military action against Germany when an act of aggression is discovered, while the French draft proposes that joint action be taken as soon as a threat of aggression is discovered. The former is based on the wording of the British-Soviet alliance treaty, while the latter uses the wording of the French-Soviet alliance treaty. The French-Soviet alliance treaty stipulates that action can be taken if necessary before aggression becomes a fait accompli. The French side believes that this provision is more realistic. The French pointed out that Hitler's invasion of the Rhineland in 1936, if Britain and France had taken joint action at that time, the outbreak of the European War might have been avoided. It is expected that the French government will firmly demand this point in the British-French alliance treaty negotiations.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Insists on Four Powers Dominating Peace Conference, Opposing Equal Negotiations for Small Nations; Foreign Vice-Ministers' Meeting Ends on the 25th of This Month</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 20th] Regarding the issue of allowing small nations to participate in discussions on the German peace treaty, the representatives of France and the Soviet Union engaged in a fierce debate at yesterday's Four Foreign Vice-Ministers' meeting. The distance between their opinions seems to have grown even further than before. French representative M. Mueville stated, "Allied soldiers and civilians sacrificed millions of lives for a common goal. If the Four Foreign Vice-Ministers' meeting decides not to communicate reports to them, it will make them extremely embarrassed. This action is truly arrogant." Soviet representative Gusev immediately retorted, "Millions of Soviet soldiers are also buried in Europe. Who knows what they would think of the demands of certain governments? I really don't want to think about it anymore." The Soviet representative then rejected three other proposals, believing they would confuse the situation and turn the four-nation meeting into a plenary session. At this point, Mueville suggested that the Soviet Union's views should be revised, but Gusev remained unchanged, insisting on the principle of hierarchy, opposing equal negotiations, and advocating that the four powers should absolutely dominate everything. It is reported that this morning's Four Foreign Vice-Ministers' meeting will further discuss the matter based on the French proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers on the German question decided today to conclude its work on February 25th. They hope that the report on the views of small countries will be passed on Monday. The report on the procedures will be passed on Tuesday. At today's meeting, the representatives decided to establish a committee to maintain communication between the foreign ministers' meeting and the small countries. The Soviet Union's procedural draft calls it the Standing Committee, while the other three countries' drafts call it the Advisory and Information Committee. As to whether the eighteen small countries and the four powers should be members of the committee at the same time, a decision could not be reached and it must be submitted to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion.</p>
<h3>Corfu Channel Incident: Albania Submits a Defense, Counter-Accusing Britain of Violating Sovereignty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] Albanian representative Capo today refuted Britain's accusation that Albania laid mines in the Corfu Channel in the Security Council and counter-accused British warships of violating its territorial waters.

The British warships entering the strait near the Albanian coast constitutes provocation and intimidation." During Capo's nearly two-hour speech, Soviet representative Gromyko immediately stood up to defend Albania and engaged in a verbal battle with British representative Jebb. The meeting adjourned during the debate and is scheduled to reopen on the 21st.</p>

The long-troubled issue of Overseas Chinese in Hanoi has been satisfactorily resolved. Before the retreat, the Vietnamese army secretly dispatched senior personnel to pay their respects to our consulate and requested that we protect the Vietnamese wounded soldiers who could not retreat from a humanitarian standpoint. Because the Vietnamese side did not want to implement a scorched earth policy and make any destruction, this is really a friendly gesture to our Overseas Chinese, so as to avoid increasing the losses of our Overseas Chinese. Our Consul General Yuan then inspected the Overseas Chinese district on the morning of the 18th and consulted with the French army on maintaining law and order, transporting food, and supplying water. The situation is still going smoothly.</p>

<h3>Truman Recommends to Congress to Abolish Wartime Emergency Law</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] President Truman today requested Congress to abolish or amend approximately 100 temporary laws promulgated under the state of emergency. The President's message to Congress stated: The progress of the reconstruction work has enabled the American economy to gradually lift the shackles of wartime control. I hereby request Congress to abolish certain emergency decrees implemented after 1939, as well as the national emergency declared by President Roosevelt in 1941. I have ordered all government departments to stop exercising the powers granted by the emergency decrees. If this proposal is accepted, it will help the national economy get rid of wartime control and end the wartime emergency as soon as possible. I have continued to study the issue of terminating the emergency states declared in 1939 and 1941, and I plan to take action as soon as the environment permits. President Truman's action is the second step in repealing wartime legislation and is welcomed by all departments of Congress. The President announced the end of the state of war on December 31st last year. He stated at the time that the national emergency had not ended, which was his first step in repealing the emergency state. Today's action by the President is his second step. The next stage is often for the President to formally announce the end of the national emergency declared by the late President Roosevelt in 1939 and 1941. The final stage is to formally announce the end of the state of war.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Financial Revenue Budget Can Increase by 23.2 Billion This Year; Budget Committee of the City Council Held a Meeting Yesterday; Resolution to Confirm Awaits Public Decision by the General Assembly</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Budget Committee of the City Council, considering that the second session of the General Assembly is about to expire and the municipal government budget for the 36th year needs to be determined urgently, held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. First, it confirmed the various financial revenue items in preparation for submitting them to the General Assembly for enactment. In addition to the Budget Committee Senators Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, Zhao Yangxiong, Qu Cheng and other twelve people, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan, Deputy Director Hu Wenyuan, Chief Accountant Min Xiangfan, and the section chiefs of various departments of the Finance Bureau attended the meeting to report. He Yuanming served as chairman of the meeting.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, the budget was increased by 33.1 billion and reduced by 9.9 billion, resulting in a net increase of 23.2 billion yuan. The resolved increases and decreases in tax revenue include:</p>
<p>(1) Land Tax: The municipal government originally budgeted 569 million. Now, the Budget Committee has requested the financial authorities to work hard to collect the tax effectively, and it is hoped that it can be increased by 50 percent, so that a total of more than 850 million yuan can be collected.</p>
<p>(2) Business Tax: It was originally determined to collect 40 billion yuan annually, of which this city should receive 70 percent, or 28 billion. It is now decided to temporarily add 40 billion, so the budget is 56 billion. The collection targets for this revenue recovery total 60,073 households.</p>
<p>(3) House Tax: The Finance Bureau estimates that 25 percent of the houses in Shanghai are used for business and 75 percent are used for residential purposes. However, the Budget Committee believes that this estimate is not entirely accurate and should be calculated based on 40 percent for business use and 60 percent for residential use. As for the rent, citizens may underreport. It is now tentatively decided to increase it by 50 percent, so that it can be increased to 2.7 billion based on the original 1.8 billion.</p>
<p>(4) Slaughter Tax: The original budget was 9.6 billion. The committee originally planned to increase it by 50 percent. However, due to the recent soaring prices and the obvious decrease in the number of citizens eating meat, the slaughterhouses slaughter pigs every day, previously at least 400, but now only 200. However, because the collection standard has increased slightly, it was decided to increase it by 25 percent, to 12 billion.</p>
<p>(5) Business License Tax: Approximately 30,000 households are currently being collected. This can be increased to 50,000 households. However, the central government has changed the tax rate to 3 per thousand, so the budget remains unchanged at 900 million.</p>
<p>(6) Usage License Tax: The original amount was 3.6 billion. Now, because the central government stipulates that the maximum collection for privately owned vehicles is 30,000 yuan, and the maximum collection for commercial vehicles is 50,000 yuan, the budget is reduced by one-fourth, which is 2.7 billion.</p>
<p>(7) Feast Tax: The original amount was 24 billion. Now, because the tax rate has been reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent, the budget is reduced by 4.8 billion, for a total of 19.2 billion.</p>
<p>(8) Hotel Tax: The original amount was 8.4 billion. Now, because the tax rate has been reduced, the budget is reduced by one-half, which is 4.2 billion.</p>
<p>(9) Entertainment Tax: Increase the original budget of 26.2 billion by 1 billion, for a total of 27.2 billion.</p>
<p>(10) Wharf Tax: Maintain the original budget of 3 billion.</p>
<p>(11) Inheritance Tax: The central government has decided to do its best to rectify it, so increase the original amount of 127 million yuan by one time, for a total of 255 million yuan.</p>
<p>(12) Public Property Rent: Maintain the original amount of more than 240 billion yuan and add a stall rent item of 300 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Focus on Fighting Tigers, Not Swatting Flies; Avoid Harassing Legitimate Businesses; Head of Supervisory Group Indicates Two Principles at Staff Meeting</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The staff of the Economic Supervisory Group held a meeting at the police headquarters office yesterday morning at 10 a.m. The head of the group, Xuan Tiewu, indicated two principles: (1) The Supervisory Group is ordered to thoroughly investigate this gold rush. It must start from the big picture, secretly investigate and strictly deal with large households that stir up trouble and engage in speculative manipulation. Legitimate businesses should be avoided from harassment, and other small households will be dealt with on a discretionary basis, adhering to the principle of "fighting tigers, not swatting flies." (2) The task of the Supervisory Group is not only to thoroughly investigate the gold and banknote price surge in the city after February 1st, but also to be responsible for implementing the economic emergency measures promulgated by the central government to stabilize prices and ensure people's livelihood. Therefore, any illegal acts related to social economy are within the scope of the Supervisory Group's investigation and handling. It is hoped that all working comrades will work hard.</p>
<p>[In addition news] The three-person team organized by the Gold and Banknote Group of the Economic Supervisory Group and the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Offices is still investigating the accounts of banks and money shops these days. Yesterday, in the Gold and Banknote Group office of the police station, work continued until late at night. The black list of suspected manipulators and speculators is gradually being compiled. This black list will be submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval after the investigation is completed. Yesterday, several money shops and banks closed down and stopped operating, claiming to the investigators that the manager had gone elsewhere and refusing to hand over the account books. The Supervisory Group has ordered that anyone who encounters this situation can be detained. Also, although the free trading of gold has been banned, the government has not made any explicit regulations on the disposal of gold stored by businesses and individuals. Speculative big players who have bought large amounts of gold are bound to be unwilling to sell it to the Central Bank at the legal price and will seek illegal ways out. The Supervisory Group recently discovered that a gold shop was melting large bars into small pieces. It is even more difficult to guarantee that there will be no black market. The Supervisory Group has few people and cannot see and hear everything, and feels very棘手. Xu Youzuo, the leader of the Gold and Banknote Group, has signed a report to the Supervisory Leader Xuan yesterday to submit it to the government, and plans to request a clear regulation on how to deal with the gold that the people have already purchased.</p>

The accusers described the victims' situation in court yesterday, gritting their teeth, as if they wanted to eat his flesh alive. Sun Doushun denied it and claimed that it was a malicious accusation caused by a land dispute between the Sun and Liu families. He also knelt down and kowtowed, repeatedly shouting "Injustice." The court discussion was adjourned for a retrial, and the defendant was taken back into custody.</p>

<h3>Coffins Have a Wonderful Use: Hiding Drugs Inside; Boss and Partner Arrested Together</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Wang Bingyan, the leader of the Yijing Penglai Brigade of the Righteous Volunteer Corps, and his team members patrolled the Nanshi jurisdiction on the morning of the 18th. Passing by Maojia Lane, they saw someone smoking opium in a shantytown. They immediately arrested the opium addict and brought him to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, his name was Chen Linyi, also known as "Coffin Board." The opium he smoked was bought from Zhu Gengen at No. 12, Lane 57, Sangyuan Street, Dainanmen. Police were dispatched to the address, and Zhu was arrested. He confessed that he sold drugs, all of which he obtained from Zhu Youfu (18 years old), a clerk at the Hongchang Coffin Shop at No. 28, Qiujia Lane, Nanchang Street. Zhu was also arrested at the address. He confessed that the shop was a drug trafficking organization and that the owner's name was Qian Bingnan.

<h3>Anonymous Accusation Against Hospital Director: Stealing and Selling Milk; All Nurses Called for Questioning Claim Ignorance</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Cai Baotian, the director of general affairs at the Police Hospital on Huade Road in this city, was recently anonymously accused by "all the nurses" to the police station, alleging that Cai had embezzled 5,000 cans (more than 200 boxes) of milk allocated to the hospital by the headquarters and other materials. However, after investigation by the police station, all the nurses in the hospital denied the accusation, and there was no solid evidence that the milk was stolen. Although the police station could not ascertain the inside story of the case for the time being, if the anonymous accusation was true, the case would be major, and the accused Cai Baotian had already resigned. Although it was impossible to know whether the reason for his resignation was related to the case, it was still worth investigating. Therefore, the entire case has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. The prosecutor specially summoned more than a dozen female nurses from the hospital, including Chen Zongzhen, Hu Limin, Shen Weizhen, Lu Fudao, and Wang Zhangzhu, for questioning. All of them stated that they knew nothing about the accusation against Cai Baotian. All the summoned people were ordered to return, and another investigation was launched.</p>

<h3>Liang Renda Met With Misfortune: Mayor Wu Deeply Mourned; Personally Visited Liang's Family Yesterday; Decided to Assist With Life and Education</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yang Ruijun, the righteous brother of Liang Renda, who was killed in the Quan Gong Building incident, visited Mayor Wu at the City Government at 11 o'clock yesterday morning to discuss Liang's funeral arrangements. Mayor Wu said that he wanted to discuss this issue with Liang's family, so he accompanied Zhang Peter, the chief of the Public Relations Section, to the Yongle New Village on Beisha Wujiang Road to visit Liang Renda's family. When Mayor Wu arrived, only Liang's aunt and wife were at home. They expressed their extreme gratitude for Mayor Wu's personal visit.</p>
<p>Fundraising; Joint Custody</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said: "Mr. Liang Renda was killed in the Quan Gong Building incident, and I am deeply saddened. I have now instructed the Police Bureau to step up the pursuit of the murderer. At the same time, I have ordered the court to work hard, and I believe that the truth will soon come to light. Please rest assured." "What I am most concerned about now is that Mrs. Liang is already pregnant, and the future life and education expenses of the orphans must be taken care of by the City Government. According to my intention, I hope that at least 100 million yuan can be raised. The method of fundraising will be collective donations. Although the market in Shanghai is currently sluggish, fundraising may be difficult. However, I am determined to find a way to raise funds. The funds raised can be used to establish a custody committee, with Mr. Guo Lingshuang, General Manager of Wing On Company, as the chairman, and one representative from the City Government and Liang's family will jointly manage it. As for the use of the donations, Mrs. Liang has the right to decide."</p>
<p>Funeral Arrangements; Should Be Simple</p>
<p>Regarding Liang's funeral arrangements, I believe that we should strive for simplicity. The family can handle it themselves. In addition, the City Government will hold a public memorial ceremony, and representatives from various groups will be invited to participate in it to express their condolences. However, we must not expand it to the point of involving political issues, which will not only affect public security, but also hinder fundraising. Wu said at the end: "The dead are gone, and we must help the living to comfort the soul of the deceased. Therefore, Mrs. Liang must take good care of herself and leave an heir for the deceased. If she feels unwell due to stimulation, I can find a way to contact the hospital."</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Liang expressed two wishes: (1) Please punish the murderer severely, and (2) Liang Renda's tomb should be surveyed and determined. Mayor Wu said that he would definitely be able to do it. Wu left at 12:30.</p>
<h3>Zang Daerzi Case: Lai Lingnai Sentenced; Instigated Injury Resulting in Death; Sentenced to One Year and Nine Months; Defendant Expressed Disagreement in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] In the Zang Daerzi case, the Spanish sailor Lai Lingnai was prosecuted by the prosecutor for the crime of instigating injury resulting in death. After repeated trials by the court, the debate was concluded on the 14th of this month. The sentence was announced in the Criminal Division 8 of the court at 2 p.m. yesterday. American Vice Consul Wei Li and legal advisor Frankt were present in court. After Judge Wu Ronglin took the stand, he brought the defendant Lai Lingnai to court and read the judgment: "Lai Lingnai is sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment for instigating injury resulting in death." The judgment stated: "The defendant Lai Lingnai was slightly drunk after drinking, which led to a misunderstanding and accidentally violated the law. His criminal circumstances are still pitiful and excusable. According to law, the original sentence should be reduced by one-half, and because his crime was committed before December 31, 1946, it is in accordance with the provisions of the Great Amnesty and Commutation of Sentence and should be reduced by one-half again, and he is sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment." It was also found that the principal offender, Rao Delike, is an active-duty American naval officer stationed in Shanghai. In accordance with Article 1 of the Regulations for the Handling of Criminal Cases Involving American Military Personnel in China, he has been tried by the American Military Court in Shanghai. The defendant expressed his disagreement in court and will appeal to the High Court.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper Promotes Free Midwifery Movement; Many Applicants Hope That All Sectors Will Donate Generously</h3>
<p>In recent years, the population of Shanghai has been increasing continuously, exceeding four million, and at the same time, the birth rate has also greatly increased. Every day in this huge city, countless mothers give their children new life. These new lives will become the masters of the country in the future, and they will shoulder the great mission of continuing the nation and creating the future. But unfortunately, many babies end their short lives when or before they leave their mothers, and even more pitiful mothers lose their health or sacrifice their lives forever for the sake of the new generation! We express our infinite sympathy for these unfortunate people, and we also want to provide assistance, but our strength is so weak that we can only cry out for them, hoping to get the sympathy and assistance of the vast population.</p>
<p>Countless pregnant mothers may be in extremely difficult circumstances. They cannot get enough rest, and they cannot get reasonable medical treatment. When they give birth, they do not have scientific methods to help them deliver. Under various unreasonable attacks, they lose their lives, and perhaps at the same time destroy the new generation. Although we have already launched the poor women's midwifery movement with the Renhe Hospital, its foundation still needs the support and encouragement of the readers of this newspaper and people from all walks of life to consolidate it.</p>
<p>(According to the free midwifery service, which began on the 14th of this month, eight applications have been approved, and their names are listed below: (1) Zhang Zhu's, (2) Zhang Chenxing, (3) Yao Feiyun, (4) Li Xiufang, (5) Wang Zhendong, (6) Mo Zhenqiu, (7) Yang Aying, (8) Man Yunxian. The above eight people have gone to the hospital to await delivery. Donations can be sent to the Shenbao Social Service Department.)</p>

<h3>US Ambassador Writes to Soviet Foreign Minister: Discussing US-Soviet Cultural Exchange; Requests Response to Nine Important Suggestions</h3>
<p>[US News Agency Washington, 9th] The State Department has just released the contents of a letter from US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. In the letter, Smith reiterated the US side's Fang Gan suggestions on cultural exchange between the two countries. The letter, dated February 3, was delivered to Moscow newspapers by Smith on Tuesday. The letter requests the Soviet Union to respond to several suggestions for cultural cooperation transmitted by the US Embassy. However, the Soviet Union's final reply has not yet been received. The full text of the letter is as follows: "Recently, it was reported that Marshal Stalin, when meeting with Roosevelt Jr., solemnly stated that he approved of the exchange of cultural and scientific information between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the exchange of students, artists, scientists, and professors. I am extremely gratified by this matter, because I have always been an advocate of this kind of exchange, as you know. This kind of exchange is sufficient to expand the basis of contact so that the people of your and our countries can understand each other's cultural life and goals. Recently, we have made some progress in this regard, especially in the exchange of cultural and scientific publications, but there is still much to be done in terms of the overall plan. After hearing Marshal Stalin's remarks, I was greatly encouraged, and I would like to draw your attention to several suggestions regarding the aforementioned exchange. These suggestions have been submitted to the US Embassy by various agencies and groups in the United States and are now awaiting your consent for implementation. The most important of these are as follows:</p>
<p>Exchange of Scientists; Focus on Medicine</p>
<p>(1) When the delegation of the Soviet War Relief Office visited the United States last August, Dr. Yang Ge suggested that a fully equipped penicillin factory be provided for the Soviet Union's convenience, and at the same time suggested that the United States and the Soviet Union exchange scientists, especially those in the field of medicine. Dr. Yang had discussed this matter with the Soviet Ministry of Health, but as of now, his suggestion has not yet received a response.</p>
<p>Please Have Soviet Graduate Students; Go to the United States to Teach Russian</p>
<p>(2) In July 1946, Mr. Zhai Pu and Dr. Rowan of the US Department of Commerce consulted with their Department of Higher Education when they visited the Soviet Union, discussing Cornell University's request to invite four Soviet graduate students to the United States to engage in post-graduate work and teach some Russian language courses. The US side did not insist on sending American students to study in the Soviet Union as an exchange condition. At that time, I had a thorough expression to the Soviet Department of Higher Education on this matter. At that time, I had the impression that the department was willing to accept this suggestion, but because the start of the fall semester was extremely imminent, we were unable to take any further concrete measures with the department. The plan was abandoned in November. A deputy director of the department, Mr. Sama Lin, recently wrote to me (letter dated January 29), saying that the department welcomed the embassy's suggestion, but it would be difficult to implement this suggestion during this academic year (1946-47). I very much hope that this item will be reconsidered and accepted when the spring semester arrives.</p>
<p>American Geologists; Willing to Conduct Joint Research</p>
<p>(3) Professor Flynn of Yale University is very eager to conduct field research with Soviet geologists and consult with them on the geological characteristics of the Soviet Union's alluvial period. Dr. Flynn's request and self-consideration letter were sent to the President of the Soviet Science School on December 16, 1946. Since he is an authoritative American geologist, I sincerely hope that his request will be approved.</p>
<p>The United States Advocates Setting Up; Scholarships for Soviet Female Students</p>
<p>(4) In the summer of 1946, Mrs. Diekinson, Chairman of the US Women's Club Federation, came here at the invitation of the Soviet side to inspect Soviet post-war work and study Soviet welfare plans. She set up a scholarship for Soviet female students studying abroad in the name of the General Federation. I believe that the number of scholarships can be increased. Mrs. Diekinson subsequently received a notice saying that the suggestion to set up a scholarship was not accepted. I hereby suggest reconsidering this matter, as it is clearly in line with the principles of expanding education and cultural contact.</p>
<p>Invite Soviet Song and Dance Troupes; To Participate in American Dance Party</p>
<p>(5) I recently forwarded to Vox a letter of invitation from American dance manager Herlock, inviting Soviet song and dance troupes to participate in the International Dance Party to be held at the New York Capital Theater in the spring of 1947, and to tour the United States after the Spring Festival. This matter is currently being discussed with Vox, but there is no concrete development yet. As you know, I greatly admire Russian song and dance, and I can assure you that Soviet song and dance troupes will be extremely popular in the United States. The participation of the song and dance troupe in the International Dance Party will have excellent results. I sincerely hope that this invitation can be accepted.</p>
<p>American Doctors Visit the Soviet Union; Request Soviet Permission</p>
<p>(6) I recently received a request from the United States, signed by the Chief Medical Officer of the Public Health Service, requesting permission for three American doctors, Huoqijia, Ximjin, and Hill, to visit the Soviet Union to study methods of treating cancer. The development of Doctors Roskin and Kliuva and other famous Soviet medical scientists in the research of cancer has aroused the greatest interest in the United States. I myself have met with Doctors Roskin and Kliuva and other members of the Soviet Medical Research Association, and I have been impressed that their recent contributions to the human struggle against cancer may have a great effect. If the United States' request can be approved as soon as possible, the people and the government will be very grateful.</p>
<p>American University Anniversary; Invite Soviet Scholars</p>
<p>(7) In February 1946, Dr. Du Zi, President of Princeton University, invited several famous Soviet scholars, including Professors Kabisa, Landau, and Daivilov, to participate in the university's 200th anniversary celebration through the Soviet Embassy in Washington. At the same time, the Rockefeller Foundation also sent invitations to Professors Vinogradov and Gutlierale. Although Princeton University's 200th anniversary has passed, I know for sure that if the Soviet government expresses its willingness to accept, they will be invited to the United States again.</p>
<p>American Symphony Orchestra; Invite Soviet Musicians</p>
<p>(8) In March 1946, the embassy forwarded to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs an invitation from Mr. Keiper, the leader of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Kai invited Mr. Marvinsky, the conductor of the Leningrad Orchestra, to the United States as a guest of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, from October 21 to November 4, 1946, or from December 16 to December 30. This invitation has not yet been answered, and the repeatedly postponed dates have also passed. However, the orchestra has told me that if the Soviet government has the intention to encourage musicians to accept the invitation, the orchestra will be willing to send out an invitation again.</p>
<p>Boston Orchestra; Plans to Go to the Soviet Union to Perform</p>
<p>(9) In June 1946, the embassy forwarded a letter from Mr. Kossevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The letter suggested that the orchestra be allowed to travel to the Soviet Union at its own expense to perform, stay for two weeks, and said that all ticket revenue would be donated to local public welfare organizations according to the Soviet side's instructions. The orchestra said that the Soviet Union had made great cooperation with the United States during the war, and hoped to express its gratitude. The embassy's letter was also unanswered. At the same time, given that the date proposed by the orchestra for visiting the Soviet Union (September 1946) was approaching, the ambassador sent another letter to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 2, asking how to respond to the change. However, no response has been received to date. If the Soviet side now intends to accept this suggestion, I am always happy to pass this news on to the orchestra so that it can reconsider the previous proposal.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you can express your opinions on the above suggestions, (especially on any further measures that this embassy can take for the important work of cultural and scientific exchange), and I would be grateful if you would allow it."</p>

<h3>Qian Dui Industry Members' Meeting; Requests Central Bank to Approve Deposit and Loan Business</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Money Exchange Commercial Association held a general meeting of all members yesterday at 3:00 PM at the association's headquarters. 215 industry representatives attended, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM. At the beginning of the meeting, Wang Yuncheng, Chairman of the association, delivered a speech, stating that the government has promulgated new emergency economic measures to stabilize the domestic economy and finance. The industry should earnestly implement and support the national policy. However, it is also hoped that the industry can find a way out under the new plan. Before the war, the industry also engaged in small deposit and loan businesses. After the City Government announced the three measures for buying and selling US dollars on October 4 last year, the industry found it difficult to maintain its business. It had requested the Central Bank to allow it to engage in small deposit and loan businesses, but has not yet received a response. During yesterday's meeting, seven measures were immediately passed and recommended to the Central Bank: (1) Adjust the capital of Qian Dui companies to a considerable amount. (2) All companies that have obtained the Central Bank's Class A license to operate in foreign currency trading can also engage in small deposit and loan businesses. (3) To prevent the replacement of licenses, the important staff of each store shall not be changed. (4) Adopt a uniform accounting system for the silver and money industry for uniformity and to facilitate inspection by the authorities. (5) All deposits should also pay deposit reserve to the Central Bank in accordance with the general silver and money industry regulations to comply with financial laws. (6) All company names should be changed to the name of Qianzhuang. (7) The above points will be implemented immediately upon approval by the Central Bank. According to the industry, the industry's request to engage in small deposit and loan businesses is to maintain its own business, and because the industry has frequent contact with small industrial and commercial businesses, it is quite convenient to handle the business. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to send Chairman Zai Yuncheng, Standing Director Liu Xichen, Li Lansheng, and others to visit Mayor Wu, City Council Speaker Pan, Finance Director Xu Baiyuan, Central Bank Governor Bei, and the City Chamber of Commerce today to present the difficulties.</p>

Since the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, the Ministry of Finance continues to enforce this regulation. All banks and trading houses are absolutely prohibited from engaging in remittance services for national currency to Hong Kong until they have been approved to resume them.</p>
<h3>Silver and Banking Industry Preparatory Committee: Central Bank Ceases Lending</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee previously had access to an overdraft of 5 billion yuan from the Central Bank. However, within the Emergency Economic Measures, the Financial Control Act stipulates that national banks and bureaus must not use funds to transfer loans to provincial and municipal banks or commercial firms through currency buying or other means.

The important resolutions are as follows: (A) When ten important export products are transported south, they must be settled in designated banks, and a certificate from the settlement bank must be obtained before they can be transported south by the Guangdong-Hankou Railway.</p>
<p>Ten Export Products</p>
<p>Are (1) hog bristles, (2) feathers, (3) casings, (4) goatskins, (5) galls, (6) tung oil, (7) ramie, (8) raw silk and waste silk, (9) silver, and (10) antimony. The Business Bureau and the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank will jointly issue instructions to the 29 exchange settlement banks. The above management measures will take effect from today. Any of the above materials transported south via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway from any location between Wuchang in the north and Chenxian County in the south must have a certificate issued by the designated foreign exchange management bank, proving that all US dollar or pound foreign exchange for the Hong Kong landing price of each cargo has been sold to the designated bank.</p>
<p>Egg Industry Subcommittee Meeting</p>
<p>(B) The subcommittees of the Promotion Committee are actively preparing for establishment. Yesterday, the members of the Egg Industry Subcommittee were determined to be: Liu Gongyun and Mark (the above two are conveners), Kaiser, Hudson, Langford, Bei Yu, and Zheng Yuanxing. They are actively designing to investigate the situation of the industry in detail in this month's C, in order to provide assistance such as loans and increase its export volume.</p>
<h3>Agreement Between the Supervision Group and the Cotton Yarn Industry Association: Stabilize the Buying and Selling Price of Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Price Must Not Exceed Yesterday's Market Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Yamin and Zhang Hanguang from the yarn and cloth group of the Economic Supervision Group, and Liu Wenteng and Feng Mo from the Spinning Management Committee, went to the Shanghai Yarn Business Association yesterday afternoon to investigate. They met with Tang Zhiliang, the director of the industry association, Zhou Jiasheng, the standing director, and Zhou Zhisheng, the liaison of the intermediary association. As a result, the two parties agreed on several points, which will be implemented from today: (1) The buying and selling price in the market in the future shall be based on the brand prices of the Spinning and Construction Company and private yarn factories, with wholesalers adding 5% and retail stores adding 10%. (2) The quantity of yarn transactions, price, buyer and seller names, and purpose of each day shall be reported in detail to the Economic Supervision Group. (3) Member transactions must be held in the market, and off-site transactions will be severely cracked down. (4) The selling price of each yarn in today's market must not exceed yesterday's market price. (5) Yarn merchants should count and investigate the quantity of yarn in stock as of the 25th of this month for examination.</p>
<h3>Spinning Management Assigns Personnel to Supervise the Market</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the provisions of Article 3 of the Stabilizing Yarn Price Measures, the Spinning Management Committee has specifically assigned its commissioner Feng Mo to be stationed in the cotton yarn market of the Cotton Yarn Business Association for supervision starting yesterday. From yesterday onwards, the cotton yarn market shall fill in the transaction quantity, price, buyer and seller names, and purpose of cotton yarn on the transaction order every day, and register and report it to Commissioner Feng for examination.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Process: Stable and Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market was extremely stable, and people's hearts were still firm. The reason is that the reserve price is already cheap, and it is quite unlikely to fall again. Due to the high cost of raw materials and the increasing expenses, in terms of cost, yarn factories have no profit to speak of. Therefore, although customer sales have been silent for a long time, the price can still stand firm. The price of 20-count ordinary yarn is about 350,000 yuan. The closing price of the Special Double Horse is similar to that of the previous day. The price of 42-count slightly decreased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. The rest of the counts saw ups and downs. At present, the yarn market is still in a hovering situation.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were stagnant due to tight silver circulation, and both the origin and customer sides were dull. Moreover, the price cone was too high, the purchasing power was very weak, and the dyeing factories in the market had sales of fine cloth. The Spinning and Construction Company supplied and sold 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth at a price of 148,500 yuan, and the on-site price was 153,000 yuan, which caused people's hearts to be empty and soft, and floating goods were full of chips, and once fell to 148,000 yuan, but the Hankou customer group absorbed medium-grade fine cloth, and the appetite was very healthy, so the market was stable, and it was slightly lower than the previous day by 2,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan. Other Shilin cloth and colored cloth, the foot also shaped uninspired</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Still Lacks Transactions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Tung oil still lacked transactions today, and the producing areas frequently reported price increases, and the price matched the peak of exports. According to a merchant in this city, there are frequent reports from Hankou that Hong Kong has a lot of appetite. In addition, the increase in export foreign exchange stimulated the market, so the foot was very firm, and the market was short of goods, and the bid was raised higher and higher. Yesterday, the price in Hankou was close to 400,000 yuan per dan. In Hangzhou, although there were still many goods arriving from the producing areas, the price was not low, and it had already stood at the peak of 400,000 yuan. The price negotiated by the industry in this city is 450,000 yuan per dan, which is actually at the top of the export price, or even exceeds it, and no transactions have been heard in the general market. In addition, domestic tung oil, Dingxi Hongji Yingfeng, has long disappeared, and Fuxi Hong is also in short supply. It is said that only one company still has inventory, and although the goods arriving daily are not very large, small quantities arrive one after another.</p>
<h3>Prices of Fur Goods Rise Sharply: Jewish Merchants Search Vigorously</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The new prices of yellow weasel skin, badger skin, white weasel skin, leopard skin, and green goatskin have risen extremely sharply, and have increased by 100% to 200% compared to before February 6. Yellow weasel skin has risen from 14,000 yuan per pair to 32,000 yuan, badger skin has risen from 8,000 yuan per piece to 15,000 yuan, white weasel skin has risen from 9,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan, leopard skin has risen from 170,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, and green goatskin has risen from 6,000 yuan to 13,000 yuan. The market is active, Jewish merchants are searching vigorously, and the export prospects are optimistic.</p>
<h3>Hog Bristles Are Quoted at Different Prices: New Price of Casings Has Not Been Negotiated</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the quoted price of hog bristles, Shanghai No. 17, is still between 3 million. The hog bristles in Hankou and Chongqing, because the producing areas have not yet officially started, the quoted prices here are still different. According to people in the industry, the new price can be made in Shanghai in the coming days.</p>
<p>Casings: The new price is still hindered due to the different steps in the operation and purchase price among the industry.</p>
<p>Galls: After the new price of belly pouch and corner pouch was opened, the market price rose again today. Each dan (133 pounds) has risen to 320,000 yuan, which is completely different from 170,000 yuan per dan before February 6. The price has increased by 100%.</p>
<h3>Mostly Medium and Secondary Transactions: Supply and Demand of Rice and Grain Are Both Low</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, more than 17,900 stones of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets. The supply and demand were both low, and most of the transactions were medium and secondary. High-quality materials were quite rare, and the situation became that the high prices were decisive and the prices were flat.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Because the off-market price is higher than the reviewed price, there is no transaction in the market. It is heard that the off-market raw soybean oil and sesame oil have consistently fallen by more than 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake Shantou Xiamen moved slightly, the seller is also firm, and the market is stable. Yellow Beans: Nanyang Fuzhou adopted an increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour was stronger by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to the high cost of raw materials. Bran's actual sales were not strong, it was firm early and tired in the afternoon, and the price was reduced by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame Nanyang moved unsteadily, with little honor or disgrace. Raw Peanut Hong Kong Nanyang moved to handle, drying and roasting, rising step by step, and continued to rise by 15,000 to 6,000 yuan. Mung beans arrived and sold indifferently, and the price was flat. The same is true for adzuki beans, which are both rare, and the market is mediocre. Broad beans have a fixed price, and Renliang has no fluctuations for the time being. Corn is dull and lacks vitality, and the market is downstream, continuing to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Sweet potato dried goods are arriving more and more, gradually declining, and falling again by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Cotton cake is firm with the increase in fuel prices. Wheat is scarce and firm.</p>
<h3>Tea Export Business Association: Discuss Export Methods: Resolved to Continue to Ask the Government to Buy at a Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Tea Export Business Association held a temporary member meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss how to promote the export of Chinese tea in the 35th year. More than 70 member representatives attended, chaired by Chairman Tang Jisan. The discussion was dismissed at about 6:00 p.m., and the results were decided on three points: (2) The tea collected last year is still requested by the government to purchase. The central purchase price of various teas is 1,188,000 yuan per dan for Qimen red, 950,000 yuan per group for Chen green, and 670,000 yuan for Ping green. It is also required that the purchase period should not exceed two months at most. (2) Organize a tea export promotion committee. If the government decides to purchase, it will assist the government in promoting exports. Otherwise, it will find its own way to export. (3) If the government does not agree to purchase, it is hoped that the original loan from the Farmers Bank can be extended for another three to six months. At the same time, it is requested to increase the loan by 40% according to the original loan amount in order to offset the export expenses.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Green Tea Transactions</h3>
<p>The tea market, which had been silent for many days, still did not see any brightness yesterday morning. After this, some green teas, such as Chouzhen, Zhenmei, and Zhenmei, which were loved by French Africa, had a heated consultation between Wu Chang Tea Company and foreign firms such as Xiehe and Tongfu, and the cargo party, and more than 1,000 boxes of new tea in the 35th year were officially agreed upon. In terms of price, Tuzhuang Tunxi Zhenmei jumped to 600,000 yuan per dan, and Wenzhou Zhenmei Jin Kou 450,000 yuan per dan. If Wenzhou needle eyebrow, from 220,000 to 270,000 yuan, Wenzhou deputy show eyebrow also reached 180,000 yuan, the market atmosphere was unanimously excited. As for Qimen black tea, which is watched by British export companies, the market still only has bidding prices due to unsuccessful negotiations. Other varieties are still extremely quiet.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Purchase Price: Still Calculated According to Production Cost</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 25th regular meeting of the Spinning Management Committee was held in the City Government Conference Room at about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, and the meeting was adjourned until 5:30 p.m. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Increase the price of two types of 34-count and 42-count three-strand yarn. The former price is 3,100,200 yuan, and the latter price is 4,216,000 yuan. (2) The purchase of cotton yarn shall be based on large packages. Factories that are not equipped with large packages shall not use grass bags instead. (3) Regarding the agreement on the purchase price of yarn, the Six District Cotton Spinning Association provided four methods, and it was decided that it should still be calculated according to the actual production cost. The new purchase price will be calculated by the Spinning Management Committee and submitted to Committee Member Wu for approval at 10:00 a.m. this morning, and it is expected to be announced and implemented tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Market Declines: Anthracite Coal Sales Are Still Active</h3>
<p>The anthracite coal market is still active due to seasonal factors, and because there are not many arrivals, the market price continues to stand at a high peak. The bituminous coal has gradually been distributed to private factories for use as allocated coal. The spot goods in the market have also loosened, and the market has seen frequent declines, and the buyers are still lacking, and there is fear of a further softening trend.</p>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs Edited by Shanghai Medical Association First Issue of Revival</p>
<h3>Our Stance</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Generally, whenever a publication is launched, there is always an opening statement declaring their work's direction and scope. Our supplement is a weekly publication hosted by the Shanghai Medical Association. It is also the only channel for connecting all Shanghai physicians and the readers of this newspaper. Therefore, the mission of this supplement is quite significant and arduous. We are well aware of the importance of this responsibility and the weakness of our own abilities. Therefore, we take this opportunity of the supplement's relaunch to briefly state the direction and scope of the journal's work in the future. On the one hand, we hope that our colleagues in the journal will have something to follow. On the other hand, we also hope that colleagues in this city can cooperate sincerely to jointly complete this great mission. If the authorities of this city and the readers of this newspaper can give us instructions and assistance from time to time, that would be what we sincerely expect and are extremely grateful for.</p>
<p>(1) We want to become a medical journal for readers: Most people who read newspapers are not interested in medical supplements because those publications are mostly too specialized, often causing headaches and making it impossible to finish reading them. Moreover, those publications are sometimes so dry and boring, simply like teachers lecturing students. Therefore, many people say that these publications are specifically for doctors themselves, not for us ordinary readers. Our colleagues in this journal are facing this reality squarely, so we are trying our best to avoid this shortcoming. We want to use a light and clear style to describe or explain various issues in both "medicine" and "pharmacy", so that everyone who reads this journal can understand it and get practical benefits, becoming a publication that every reader wants to read, instead of a publication specifically written for doctors themselves. Although this work is not easy, we are confident that we will be able to strive to do our best.</p>
<p>(2) Reporting new methods and new experiences in "medicine" and "pharmacy": I can honestly and bluntly say, "Not only is it difficult for readers to know about new medical methods and experiences, but ordinary doctors often don't have the opportunity to know due to busy schedules or other personnel matters." Although this statement may seem a bit excessive, it is actually true. Because in schools, there are professors to ask, and in hospitals, there are directors and the like to consult. But in private clinics, if one sticks to old ways, it is truly ignorant and pitiful. Let's think about it: science is changing with each passing day. If you don't follow the trend, you will fall behind and be eliminated. Some doctors sit in their clinics waiting for patients, not knowing how to contact colleagues to exchange new knowledge, not knowing how to subscribe to domestic and foreign medical publications. After a long time, how can they not become ignorant doctors? Moreover, current medicine is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and we certainly do not have much time to read medical journals from our own country and Europe and the United States. Therefore, if this journal can gather the strength of the entire Medical Association and faithfully report new medicine both at home and abroad, then not only will readers benefit, but it will also be welcomed by colleagues.</p>
<p>(3) Faithfully introduce or comment on new medical methods and new drugs on the market: We Chinese people have always had a bad habit of blindly believing in newly released drugs or newly practiced medical methods. This undiscriminating approach is most dangerous for patients. Because our country, since the Anti-Japanese War, has seen social morality decline to the extreme. Many unscrupulous merchants often take advantage of the Chinese people's weakness of "grasping at straws when sick" to invent names and sell some new drugs to swindle money. This is not only directly harmful to patients, but it can also indirectly cause the general public to lose faith in new medicine. This journal sees this point, so it hopes to faithfully introduce or criticize those currently new drugs on the market or recently popular medical methods.</p>
<p>(4) Assisting the health authorities with health facilities: We all cannot deny that the current health facilities are not yet perfect. For example, for the issue of epidemic prevention, the issue of garbage disposal, the issue of isolation of infectious diseases, and the issue of relief for the poor and sick, etc., we feel that there are still many areas that need to be improved. From the standpoint of being in the field, although it is not convenient to criticize the facilities of the health administration, we may also have insights that their health authorities cannot see. If we can publish our views in this journal and contribute to health facilities, wouldn't that be a better thing? Therefore, this journal also hopes to do its part in this area.</p>
<p>(5) Answering various difficult questions about medicine for readers: From the "Life and Health" supplement of the Current Affairs News fourteen years ago to the present, I have been the question answerer for medical affairs in many publications. I know deeply the heavy and difficult of this work. I can say very frankly: I failed in this respect, and I am very sorry to the readers who wrote to inquire. This is not because I can't answer or don't answer well, it is really because too many people come to inquire, not only asking questions endlessly and annoyingly, but also repeating them very much, causing my enthusiasm to gradually wane, and as a result, all the letters piled up (recently, the editor of the medical journal of Dagongbao also sighed about this), which not only betrayed the expectations of the readers, but also went against our original intention. What is the point of this? So I said I failed. I also went to see other people's answers, and it was difficult to satisfy people, either the answers were irrelevant, or the answers were too simple. What benefit is this to the readers? Some people are always playing their own calculations, desperately pulling patients to their own clinics, which is even more contrary to the original intention, and we don't bother to mention it.</p>
<p>So, for all kinds of difficult problems in this answering field, is there no way to solve them? Yes, I think there is a way. We are willing to agree with readers that as long as there are difficult and miscellaneous diseases with research value, we will definitely consult with experts and give detailed answers. If it is a common disease, as long as it has the value of being answered, then we will definitely combine everyone's questions and make a detailed general answer (for example, for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, we can make a very detailed answer once, and then we will not answer it again). In this way, not only will the patients themselves benefit, but other readers can also refer to it, and it can also reduce a lot of work for the colleagues of this journal. Isn't this a job that benefits all three parties? So we hope to work in this way in this area in the future."</p>
<p>In addition to the above five articles, which are the goals of our work in the future, we still have many tasks to do, such as the issue of "the debate between Chinese and Western medicine", the issue of "advanced studies for appraising physicians", and the issue of "the construction and rapid training of Western medicine talents", and so on. We will conduct detailed explorations. However, we don't want to predict too much, we only want to move forward towards the above five goals in a down-to-earth manner, only facts speak louder than eloquence.</p>
<p>Okay, let's work hard and move forward, and may readers give us assistance and correction from time to time!</p>
<h3>On the Question of the Effectiveness of the So-called New Anti-tuberculosis Drug Streptomycin</h3>
<p>— Wu Manqing</p>
<p>A patient always hopes for another miracle when they are desperate. This is a helpless thing, and it is also an understandable fact. For example, regarding the treatment of tuberculosis, how many people have sought hope in disappointment and turned into disappointment in hope. Alas, how miserable this is, but the fact is always the fact, what can we do?</p>
<p>Around the time of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we often heard that the United States had invented a special medicine for treating tuberculosis, named Streptomycin. At that time, not only people with tuberculosis were hoping for it, but we doctors were also very excited about it, thinking that there would always be a way to solve the problem of treating tuberculosis. However, now that the victory is nearly two years away, the so-called special medicine for treating tuberculosis is always late in coming. This is really killing people. I am distressed about this, not only inquiring from colleagues, but also trying to consult documents about this drug, wanting to explore its truth. But the result is disappointing, because some doctors say it is very effective, and some doctors say it has more than 80% effectiveness, while some doctors say its effectiveness is unreliable. As for the documents published in the United States, although some say it is very effective, many scholars say that it cannot have practical evaluation in clinical aspects. In short, although this Streptomycin cannot be said to have no effect on tuberculosis, the word "special effect" cannot be put on its head.</p>
<p>Recently, I obtained a batch of Streptomycin, which is produced by Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company of the United States. I saw its package insert, which clearly states that it "may be effective for germs that penicillin cannot be effective, but for tuberculosis, Malta fever, and typhoid fever, etc., it cannot be cited at this time." Let's think about it, Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company is a large pharmaceutical company in the United States, their attitude is fair, they will definitely not refuse to do business, but they will definitely not use sweet words to deceive people. Therefore, I can very clearly tell the readers that the so-called special medicine for tuberculosis, Streptomycin, is just a scapegoat being used by others, it itself is innocent.</p>
<p>So, is Streptomycin a useless drug? No, it has many uses, but it does not belong to tuberculosis. Regarding its detailed situation, Dr. Yang Shida will describe it in detail in another article, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>However, finally, I still want to say: those poor tuberculosis patients have once again fallen from hope to disappointment.</p>
<h3>The Problem of the Spleen</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Now, in our country's scientific medical community, for patients with malaria, patients with typhoid fever, patients with leukemia, and patients with black fever, the lump that grows above the left side of the waist, below the ribs, of these several kinds of patients, is called the spleen. This "spleen" character is wrong! Originally, the spleen was a character in ancient Chinese medical books, but the spleen and stomach are often said together; as Suwen Jue Lun said: "The spleen is the one who manages the stomach and circulates its body fluids." Linglan Secret Canon said: "The spleen and stomach are the officials of the warehouse, and the five flavors come from them." Taiyin Yangming Lun said: "The spleen stores and is constantly connected to the stomach." It also said: "The spleen is connected to the stomach by a membrane." Lingshu Benshu Pian said: "The spleen is combined with the stomach." Chao Yuanfang's Treatise on the Causes and Manifestations of Diseases in the Sui Dynasty, Sun Simiao's Qian Jin Fang in the Tang Dynasty, and Wang Tao's Outer Terrace Secret Essentials also said the spleen and stomach together. The Shengji Zonglu in the Song Dynasty was the same. The Four Great Masters of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties had Li Dongyuan's Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach. All the way to the present, they all recognize that the spleen and stomach are one family. Therefore, there is no doubt that the spleen is an organ of the digestive system.</p>
<p>Also, Suwen Cangqi Fashi Lun said: "The color of the spleen is yellow." Yin Changming Lun said: "The spleen is earth, governs the center." It can be known that its color is yellow, its location is in the center, so looking at its color, its position, and its physiological function, there is no doubt that it is the current pancreas. In English, it is written as Pancreas, which is born behind the stomach, and can secrete three kinds of digestive juices, flowing out to the duodenum, to digest the food that comes out of the stomach to the duodenum that the stomach has not completely digested. It can continue the digestive work of the stomach to complete the digestion. The Inner Classic says "manages the stomach and circulates its body fluids", in fact, the gastric juice is not secreted by the spleen but by the stomach itself, it can only be said "continues the stomach and completes its digestion". In short, the observations of the ancients were mostly vague and could not be finely distinguished, and there is no need to delve into it deeply. However, it is indeed undeniable that the "spleen" mentioned in the old medical books is the current "pancreas", and there is no doubt about it. The Japanese call it "膵". This character is not in our Chinese dictionaries. I don't know why they created a new character "膵" to represent the spleen? It is only by investigating the era when the character "膵" appeared that we can understand. Master Zhang Taiyan said that it is probably a corruption of the character "脺". The Book of Rites Jiao Te Sheng has "spleen and stomach" (pronounced lv liao). Zheng Kangcheng's annotation said: "Fat between the intestines", this saying can only be regarded as doubtful words, and cannot be said to be certain.</p>
<p>As for the spleen that the new doctors are talking about now, it is strange to say that Chinese medical books have never mentioned this organ. I have also discussed it with Master Zhang Taiyan, and he also said that Chinese medical books have not mentioned this thing. In English, it is written as Spleen, in German, Milz. The Japanese rashly used our Chinese character "脾" to translate it, which is really wrong. The new Chinese doctors also rashly accepted his mistake, pointing a deer and calling it a horse, stubbornly giving the "脾" character, which has been commonly used to represent the digestive system secretory gland, to others, but using the colloquialism "胰子油" that is not commonly seen in ancient medical books to represent it. Furthermore, the blood-circulating gland that ancient medical books have never mentioned, and which often swells when it comes into contact with infectious diseases, is being branded with the "脾" character. This is really too inappropriate and too ridiculous. Colleagues who care about scientific terminology should pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3>Review of Streptomycin Treatment of Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Yang Shida</p>
<p>Three years ago, we heard that the United States had invented a special medicine for tuberculosis, named "Streptomycin". We copied down the name, so as not to forget such an important name. Day after day, we looked forward to the arrival of victory, so that this savior of tuberculosis could be imported from the United States as soon as possible to save the thousands of tuberculosis patients in our country. Sure enough, shortly after the victory, a few were brought to Shanghai by special methods, and a few people were trying them. In recent months, a large number have been imported, and advertisements have been placed in newspapers to attract business. The price is quite expensive. Most of the medical community in our country has not used it, and it is inevitable that it will cause suspicion among the majority. Of course, for incurable diseases such as tuberculosis, the high price is not a problem. After all, life is more valuable than gold bars. The question is, does "Streptomycin" have any effect, and to what extent is it effective? This is a question that every patient wants to ask, and most medical colleagues find it difficult to answer for a while. The author has shallow knowledge, and although he has tried to use a small number of this drug in the pediatrics ward of the Municipal Fourth Hospital, he dare not draw conclusions. Today, I will report the results of the treatment of 100 cases of tuberculosis with "Streptomycin" recently published by H. Corwin Hinshaw and others in the Journal of the American Medical Association, to answer questions about "Streptomycin".</p>
<p>There are three major enemies of mankind in the world, namely syphilis, tumors, and tuberculosis. Every year, thousands of people die at the hands of these three enemies. Scholars from various countries are working hard and racking their brains every day to research and develop weapons to eliminate enemies. For syphilis and cancer, 606 and radium have been invented successively, which can achieve considerable effects in eliminating enemies. Only the special medicine for tuberculosis has been difficult to discover for a long time. As early as sixty years ago, we have recognized drugs that can prevent the growth of tuberculosis bacteria in test tubes, but when tested on animals with tuberculosis, they are not effective. It was not until the recent rapid development of chemotherapy that the invention of various sulfa compounds made it possible to cure artificially infected tuberculosis in animals. Since Waksman discovered "Streptomycin" in 1943, it has been known that many germs that "penicillin" cannot resist, "Streptomycin" can be effective. Waksman and others first tried it on artificially infected tuberculosis animals, and the effect was very satisfactory. H. Corwin Hinschaw and others have tried it clinically for two years, treating various types of tuberculosis, a total of 100 cases. (See the attached table) Among them, several patients suffered from more than one type or more than one site of tuberculosis. Because "Streptomycin" has recently been sold on the market, it is necessary to publish the treatment results. The tuberculosis cases they issued are all the various types routinely treated by internists and surgeons, and are not limited to pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The clinical application of "Streptomycin" is based on the results obtained in the laboratory; after infecting animals with pathogenic doses of tuberculosis bacteria, "Streptomycin" can stop the progression of the infected tuberculosis. The recent observations of H. Corwin Hinschaw and others are even more convincing. The resolution, fibrosis, or calcification of lesions can be found in various animals. The surface disappearance of lesions can be seen in at least 30% of the treated animals. The tuberculosis test changes from positive to negative, and tuberculosis in animal organs cannot be proven to exist by any sensitive bacterial examination.</p>
<p>Table of Various Types of Tuberculosis Treated with "Streptomycin"</p>
<p>Type of case Number of cases Miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis Twelve cases</p>
<p>Adult non-surgical pulmonary tuberculosis Thirty-two cases</p>
<p>Tuberculous ulcerative lesions of the respiratory tract Seven cases</p>
<p>Tuberculous empyema Seven cases</p>
<p>Tuberculous hemorrhoids Fifteen cases</p>
<p>Urinary tract tuberculosis Fifteen cases</p>
<p>Bone and joint tuberculosis Five cases</p>
<p>Adult surgical pulmonary tuberculosis Seven cases</p>
<p>Other types of tuberculosis (suffering from more than one type or more than one site of tuberculosis) Eleven cases</p>
<p>"Streptomycin" has the biological properties of treating chronic diseases. Recent advances in manufacturing can produce more pure and less toxic products. Unfortunately, the production of finished products is very expensive, and it is difficult to obtain a large number of products for the application of tuberculosis treatment.</p>
<p>Results of treatment of miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis.</p>
<p>H. Corwin Hioschaw and others have used "Streptomycin" to treat twelve patients with diffuse tuberculosis. Nine had significant meningitis, two had autopsies confirming lesions in the brain, and one only had miliary tuberculosis without neurological involvement. Six of the twelve patients have died, and autopsies have been recorded in five cases. The five surviving patients are still under observation, having been observed for two to ten months. The remaining one only started treatment for one month.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>A New Understanding of Measles Treatment</h3>
<p>— Cang Long</p>
<p>This year's measles (also known as rubella) is particularly prevalent compared to previous years. Recently, an elementary school teacher told me that over half of the children in their school's kindergarten have contracted measles, resulting in a temporary suspension of classes.</p>
<p>Older people often say, "Measles is a very common childhood disease that everyone will get. Just keep the doors and windows closed, put down the mosquito net, prevent them from catching a cold and from seeing light, and they will get better in a few days without needing a doctor." However, I must tell readers that measles is not necessarily so easy in reality. We often hear of someone's child dying from pneumonia due to measles, or someone's child dying from encephalitis due to measles. As for measles later causing the onset of pulmonary tuberculosis, that is even more common. From this, it can be seen that measles is not an ordinary infectious disease; it requires our careful handling.</p>
<p>Originally, whether an infectious disease progresses well largely depends on the patient's ability to resist and the appropriateness of the treatment method. If the patient's body is good and the resistance is strong, then even if they have measles, they will recover naturally without a doctor. If their body is not very good and the resistance is not very strong, but because the treatment is effective, then they can also recover. However, in our opinion, strengthening the body and cultivating internal resistance is paramount. Many parents in Shanghai are always worried that their children will contract measles but do not know how to prevent it in advance. In fact, if they can pay a little attention to things like vitamins usually, then it would not only be measles; I think other infectious diseases can also be prevented to some extent. Mr. Allison of England once conducted a strict statistical analysis in the Royal Hospital and found that children who took sufficient amounts of vitamin A before or during measles had very good measles progression. For the past five years, the author has given large amounts of vitamin A to children with measles during the course of the disease, and the results have also been very good. Especially for pulmonary tuberculosis (because children who have had hilar tuberculosis can become more severely ill due to measles, and sometimes develop tuberculous meningitis... i.e., infantile convulsions), giving large amounts of vitamin A is even more effective.</p>
<p>However, I must bring up one point for discussion. Although the aforementioned vitamin A is of great help for measles, children with measles can sometimes develop very severe complications, especially in cases of measles sinking inward, which we often find very tricky to deal with. What is the reason for this measles sinking inward? According to our experience, the so-called sinking inward of measles is when, after a slight rash appears, the patient's face and limbs suddenly turn blue-purple, breathing becomes rapid, the whole body is irritable and restless, and all the rashes disappear. In medical terms, this symptom is a sign of heart failure and impaired blood circulation, which is very dangerous. In traditional Chinese medicine, they are most afraid of encountering this situation. And we Western doctors, although we have many ways to remedy it, sometimes worry that it will be too late to remedy it.</p>
<p>Since World War II, various sciences have been advancing by leaps and bounds. In medicine, there have also been many new inventions and new theories. Take measles for example, there are now new theories. I will briefly describe it below:</p>
<p>Originally, the symptoms of measles are similar to those of scarlet fever and rubella, with skin rashes as the manifestation of the infectious disease. Although the pathogens of the various diseases are different, these pathogens directly attack the capillaries throughout the body. Each pathogen and its toxins invade the capillaries, causing these capillaries to be damaged. If the damage is severe, bleeding occurs. If this bleeding occurs in the epidermis, then it is various rashes, such as measles rash in measles and scarlet fever rash in scarlet fever. If the bleeding occurs in the internal organs, then it can cause inflammation of the internal organs, such as nephritis, bronchitis, and inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. This is why children with measles are prone to coughs and diarrhea. Also, after suffering from scarlet fever or measles, there is often swelling of the face and eyelids, and even swelling of the feet. This is because the kidneys are bleeding internally, which means the kidneys are inflamed. If the internal bleeding is too great, then all the capillaries are destroyed, and blood circulation is immediately disrupted, and the heart also weakens. The patient immediately feels suffocated and restless. If the treatment is not appropriate, the patient will die of heart failure. This is the real reason why measles sinks inward and the rash cannot erupt.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, we must greatly change our treatment method for measles. In order to prevent the capillaries (i.e., the smallest blood vessels in any part of the body) from being damaged by pathogens or their toxins, we must give large amounts of blood-loss agents before or during the illness, especially vitamins PP, K, and C. Whether taken orally or by injection, the effect is almost the same. If it is during the illness, then it is better to use the injection method. The author has recently found in clinical experiments that the above method is very effective. Therefore, I will specially introduce it here without fear of trouble.</p>
<p>However, I must add one more thing: if you encounter measles sinking inward, with very dangerous symptoms, often just using cardiotonics is not enough (camphor preparations, epinephrine, and caffeine are the most effective cardiotonics), then the method of hot water bath (the hot water must have a temperature of 37 or 38 degrees Celsius) often has amazing effects.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the treatment and prevention of measles, there are also things like placenta extract, patient serum, and maternal serum. Those are all methods that every doctor is familiar with, so please excuse me for not going into detail. I believe that the above-mentioned treatment to prevent capillary bleeding is not only of great value for medical practitioners to introduce, but also for those readers who have children at home, it is also beneficial to know something about it. If you can take some vitamin PP before you get sick, then maybe you can avoid many bleeding symptoms!</p>

<h3>Introducing Several Modern Famous Painters - Shanghai Art College Student Aid Society - World Famous Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Cézanne (Paul Cézanne) was a great painter of the 19th-century Expressionist school, inspiring the subjective new trends of the modern art world. He was born in southern France in 1839. His father was a banker. When he went to Paris, he initially studied law, and only began to engage in painting in 1863. Although he often associated with Impressionist painters at the time, he ultimately held his own views and was incompatible with them. In 1877, he moved back to his hometown, and for 20 years, he buried himself in painting, immediately burning anything he considered unsatisfactory. He observed objects with precision and seriousness, not only describing the objective form of things but also integrating his own emotions with the painting, subjectively expressing it with powerful colors and lines. His famous works include "The Bathers," and he is revered as the "Father of Emerging Art."</p>
<p>Van Gogh (Vincent Van Gogh) was a passionate and fiery painter of the 19th century. His paintings have the passion of fire, full of the galloping of power and the melody of passion. He was born in the Netherlands in 1853. He only began to paint after the age of 30. He was naturally uninhibited and bold, and he liked to use intense colors and vivid brushstrokes to depict the simple faces and straightforward behaviors of farmers, savages, and madmen. He also liked to express the splendor of the universe under the fiery sunlight. He committed suicide in 1890 due to an overflow of passion. The modern art world considers him a maverick of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Gauguin (Paul Gauguin), along with Cézanne and Van Gogh, was one of the three masters of Post-Impressionism. He was born in Paris in 1848. His family was poor, and he once served as a sailor on a merchant ship. When he specialized in painting, he was naturally eccentric, hated the hypocrisy of urban civilization, and admired the innocence and nature of savages. Later, he drifted to the island of Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean, married a native woman, grew a beard, and lived the life of a primitive man. He used the scenery of the island as the subject matter, using simple and clumsy lines and colors to express the primitive and simple object, opening up a new realm and a new life in modern painting.</p>
<p>Henri Matisse (Henri Matisse) is the leader of modern Fauvism, a purely French painter. He was born in 1860. He initially studied with Moreau. After studying the paintings of Ingres, Daumier, and taking inspiration from the paintings of Seurat, Degas, and Gauguin, he further elaborated on the principle of pureization from the hints of black sculpture, and finally reached the simplification of modern comprehensive art painting. He also studied Cézanne's realism, grasped the sense of reality in painting, broke through all the old rules, and directly expressed the eruption of passion, making the composition of the painting a comprehensive beauty, using electric-like lines and flower-like colors to fully express Matisse's clear and unique personality. He is still alive and his works have reached the realm of more refined art.</p>
<p>Picasso (Pablo Picasso) is the leader of Cubism. He was born in Spain in 1881. He loved painting from a young age. At the age of 14, he honorably received the third prize at the Barcelona Exhibition. When he first arrived in Paris, he did not have any amazing characteristics. Later, he followed the style of Lautrec, showing a significant tendency. Since discovering Greco, the characters in his paintings have grasped the feeling of pathos in bluish-green colors. In 1917, he returned to the Neoclassical movement, and the characters he depicted had a full sensuality and astringent red color, a completely different look from the past, gaining a very big name in the Paris art world. He is a painter with extremely strong creativity, changing his style repeatedly, and is still alive in Paris.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 176</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>As for Mr. W, just looking at the fine lines on the corner of his phoenix eyes, the contained smile, you know that he understands everything on this scene like the back of his hand. He knows that there is no need for him to speak at this time; if he opens his mouth, delaying Tsurumi's opportunity to speak, it will definitely increase Tsurumi's embarrassment. So he just sits there, appreciating the special fragrance of the cigarette Tsurumi gave him; silently waiting for Tsurumi to untie this tricky puzzle ring.</p>
<p>"Oh!" A blush rose on Tsurumi's face, indicating that he was embarrassed by his misunderstanding; but he was not like ordinary people who would cover up their shortcomings and insist to the end to save face. This "Oh" indicates that he already understands his misunderstanding; "Miss Yao's words, maybe I didn't understand them, so I misunderstood..."! He pondered for a moment, "Regarding Pingzi's aspirations, I'm still a little unsure about it...".</p>
<p>"As you all know," Tsurumi expanded the scope of his speech from Yaoqun alone to include us several people; "Pingzi is doing secret agent work, this is beyond doubt. Moreover, her methods, skills, and the subtlety of her situation are all top-notch, and cannot be measured with ordinary eyes and angles. This top-notch situation can be said to be extremely subtle, so subtle that it is impossible to determine her trend, let alone grasp her motives; perhaps only Elder Aoki understands in his heart. I am very sorry..."!</p>
<p>This confession indeed broke Tsurumi's deadlock. What he showed was a piece of frankness. This reminds me of the English proverb, "Honesty is the best policy"! Anything with cunning and deception is bound to get worse and worse.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry"! Tsurumi seemed to be hesitating a lot, "Pingzi is calling me to pay attention to this "eight" secret. Unless...unfortunately..."!</p>
<p>"Unless what?... What a pity?... "Yaoqun's degree of worry deepened.</p>
<p>"..." Tsurumi was still hesitating.</p>
<p>"Unless you try to interrogate Pingzi,... Unfortunately, she is not here..." I replied for Tsurumi from the side.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid there are bigger secrets in this 'eight'". Mr. W finally spoke his mind.</p>
<p>"If Pingzi were here, she..."? Yaoqun's words were not finished, and she stopped abruptly again, perhaps she was thinking about another question again.</p>
<p>"Are you saying that she might not be willing to speak"? Tsurumi asked Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"Yes... Just now the captain said that in this "eight", I'm afraid there are even bigger secrets, not the eight leading secret stations, nor the eight major regions that you just discovered, nor the agent number eight... If it's a bean-sized secret, I'm afraid Pingzi alone may not have fully absorbed it... Then you can ignore it for the time being. I just want to know, can you get Pingzi to tell the truth..."?</p>
<p>"Not much confidence, can only try". Tsurumi's brows furrowed together even more.</p>
<p>"If she comes, I have a way"! I lightly grabbed a sentence.</p>
<p>"Oh"? Everyone in the room was surprised.</p>
<p>"Really, Mr. Yue"? Yaoye was a little bit happy with the surprise.</p>
<p>"Brother...? Tsurumi also couldn't believe it.</p>
<h3>The New Power of Painting Print Editions</h3>
<p>— Wang Tingqi</p>
<p>— Written for the "World Famous Painting Exhibition" of the Shanghai Art College Student Aid Society</p>
<p>Saying that the power of "literature" is greater than that of "painting" seemed undeniable in the past, because as long as you can read the words, you can appreciate literature, and a famous work can be printed in thousands of copies. But the original painting, even with a very good copy, can never compare to the printed words. Therefore, in the past, paintings had to rely on words to explain and spread them. Fortunately, paintings above Impressionist painting have more relationship with literature, such as depicting biblical stories, literary stories, or literary-flavored styles. However, modern painting has become independent and is rapidly moving towards pure, abstract, and musical state. Only painting itself can express the direct intention of creation. Therefore, modern painting particularly feels that the power of communication is too weak. On the other hand, it is even more difficult to understand the works of modern painters. Today, this difficulty is about to pass, and it has already been resolved in Europe and the United States, that is, the progress of painting print editions, and the large number of prints.</p>
<p>Now the best art prints, their size can be the same as the original, the oil taste, the water taste, and the taste of various colors can all be printed. The obvious thickness of the brushstrokes and the coarseness of the cloth pattern do not seem to be printed. The difference between it and the original is very small. This progress first defeated the work of European and American hired painters in museums to make replicas. And another phenomenon has emerged, which is to bring the printed matter to the front of the original to do some repairs to the photographs.</p>
<p>This "World Famous Painting Exhibition" held by the Shanghai Art College Student Aid Society indeed has the meaning of reading the original works. Although they are all printed matters, I believe that in the future, the painting world will give art lovers the opportunity to contact them frequently through the wide-ranging holding of this kind of exhibition. The degree of public appreciation will naturally increase, and all cultures will be on a higher level.</p>

<h3>Recruitment</h3>
<p>— Wang Dongxuchu</p>
<p>In the autumn of the twenty-ninth year, Zhang Muhan and his wife traveled to Mount Qingcheng and Mount Emei, completing a compilation of their Sichuan travel notes. Daqian painted it for them. More than a year later, he showed it to me and asked me to write a poem on it. I readily composed this interpretation. The emerald bamboo screen and the spiritual light of Luogu are both scenic spots of Mount Emei.</p>
<p>Driftingly carrying occasional encounters in the forest, seeking mountains adds to the wonderful interest; staff and shoes guide the heavenly wind, in the high places of Mount Emei; the bamboo screen passes the morning rain, and the spiritual light of Yangu gathers deeply: idly recalling calling apes, a long whistle, willing to come as companions.</p>
<p>Lingering with old friends, on the raw silk, lightly flying musk ink evenly applied; it is naturally full of romance, writing the beauty of all the families, a compilation is entrusted to supplement; also do not let down Zhang Xu of the willow bank, late in pointing out the graceful smoky hair, remembering living together in the Pure Place.</p>
<h3>Return</h3>
<p>— Pan Yunfen</p>
<p>Nine years - a long time has passed.</p>
<p>Today, I am once again immersed in the place where the most precious dream shadows of my golden age once disappeared. All the people, all the things, everything, even the grass and trees here, have a sense of intimacy.</p>
<p>Looking at the setting sun of late winter hiding behind the big trees, I do not leave a trace of feeling lost.</p>
<p>"The setting sun will take away the severe winter's severe cold, desolation, and desolation, and even take away all the filth, selfishness, and meanness of the world," the morning sun of early spring will bring new hope to good people. ... So, I smiled happily, jumping, as if I were in the green fields of my hometown in early spring - vitality, activity, sunshine, flowers, youth, wheat seedlings... everything is the joy of life.</p>
<p>Walking towards the top of the small mountain where I once stayed, I sang loudly the anger, shame, and suppression that had been buried in my heart for many years and suffocated people.</p>
<p>By the gurgling stream, I whispered a long string of worries in the long years, no poems, no spring, everywhere filled with harm to the good and exploitation of human nature, it is a gray history, I almost fell into the sinking abyss of the city's paper drunken gold fans, became a grain of dross in the sewage. Fortunately, the soul that was not infected with vulgar breath has now awakened again. The sprouting grass is nodding to me, and the birds on the branches are playing pleasant music, is it blessing the new life of human troubles, is it welcoming my return?</p>
<p>I lay on the green grass by the spring river, the hard-working farmers and the old soldiers who were always panting brought me lofty ideals and noble beliefs:</p>
<p>"Life is endless work and struggle, and no harvest does not rely on cultivation"... I jumped up, shouted, and beautified.</p>
<p>"How many years have you not come back, it should be happy that your hometown has not changed much, right? After many years of looting and ravages" A lengthy and heavy voice awakened me from my fantasy.</p>
<p>"Oh, Uncle, no--"</p>
<p>"Isn't it cold, stand in the west wind and go inside!" After his reminder, I suddenly felt boundless cold invading my whole body, it turned out that it was not spring yet, the cracked land, the frozen river, the desolate countryside, the simple hearts were all shattered by the reality of military food, conscription... of words.</p>
<p>"Long years have passed, what about later? Still lost!" I heard the elders sighing.</p>
<p>Late at night, the candles kept shedding tears, accompanying the shadows shaking in the darkness, the cold wind, heavy rain hitting the window, leaning on the too intimate table, I remembered the past that had become a relic. ...</p>
<p>"Pak, Pak, Pak,..." The sound of the clapper vibrated my heartstrings, and I hurriedly pushed open the window. In the dim candlelight, that thin and pale face was so familiar. Nine years of separation, nothing has changed, only thinner, thinner!</p>
<p>Is it the third watch? I suddenly woke up, is the dark night about to pass?</p>
<p>"There will never be an endless dark night, winter days,... "Really, in the sound of this "Pak, Pak, Pak,...", I heard the prophecy of dawn and the call of spring.</p>
<p>"Should you bless?... "Thank you, great clapper, you have awakened countless people groping in the dark night, may you knock louder, awaken all those who are lost.</p>
<p>"Am I back?" Such a cordial voice, scenery? Really, only in this too familiar place, too intimate voice, in the overly simple, honest, and warm human feelings, I should be happy.</p>
<h3>Two Short Poems</h3>
<p>— Flying Hong</p>
<p>Wonton</p>
<p>You are naturally full of grievances,</p>
<p>Only to be kneaded at will,</p>
<p>And abandoned in boiling water;</p>
<p>Several ups and downs,</p>
<p>Your face is full of wrinkles.</p>
<p>Deep Alley</p>
<p>A glimmer of light is revealed on the high-rise building,</p>
<p>The fortune-teller has passed,</p>
<p>The wonton seller is still stopping,</p>
<p>Dut, dut, dut….</p>
<h3>Two Themes of Prose</h3>
<p>— Ke Ren</p>
<p>Mountain Stream</p>
<p>In spring, the mountain stream breaks free from the shackles of severe winter and sings melodiously, carrying ice chips and dead branches along the way; the water foam spits out freshness, jumping and swirling towards the two banks, as if whispering the warmth after a long separation; and the desolate and indifferent valleys also bring some vitality to it.</p>
<p>The mountain stream is not lonely! Sheep often crane their necks and drink it; those white and neat giant teeth greedily gargle, occasionally swallowing a few mouthfuls of stream water with the fresh aroma of grass. Gradually, farmers also stretched down their feet covered with mud, washing them hastily, and the nearby water surface stirred up a turbidity; the mountain stream hated this, so it flowed even louder.</p>
<p>What the mountain stream loves are the flowers that fall from the branches from time to time, and the willow catkins that are occasionally rolled off the wings of the wind; it gently floats these, slowly flowing away; stopping, and then swaying away, the waves at the bottom of the mountain stream are romantic.</p>
<p>Also, those girls who sneaked out of the village once hurriedly took a picture of their flushed faces by the stream.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever I hear the light murmur of the mountain stream from afar, my heart is filled with the joy of spring.</p>
<p>Stars</p>
<p>On how many lonely nights, the mother picked up the young one who was not yet stable in her steps, stood by the window, and pointed to him the cold stars flashing in the sky: the child curled up on the mother's shoulder, his thick black eyelashes blinking in surprise; is it the greatness and profundity of the universe that was initially conquered? But she gradually fell asleep in the mother's murmur and light song: she also sighed, what the mother pointed to was her passing youth?</p>
<p>When the child grew up, he inherited all the mother's faint melancholy. At night, he often wandered alone under the starry sky, thinking about the mysterious eyes of his little lover in his hometown, which were like stars; now he understands why the mother always likes to dream silently about the stars.</p>
<p>Due to the passage of time, the mother was aging: standing by the window late at night, there was no warm child in her arms, but the desolate shadows of wanderers in the distance were looming in front of her. I don't know if there will be another day for the reunion of the stars in this life? Thinking about it, the mother's tears and the starlight reflected each other.</p>
<p>However, the house stars are always existing with the outer space.</p>
<h3>Protection Tax</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The Kung I Company on Avenue Petain hoarded a large quantity of rice, and 235 bags were seized. The shop owner is at large, and the accountant was arrested. In his confession, he said, "The company was discovered hoarding rice by a certain organization some time ago. At that time, a bribe of six million legal tender and twelve dan of rice was paid to settle the matter." And a set of documents was presented.</p>
<p>What do these "a set of documents" prove? Do they prove that the hoarding of rice is legal from now on? The newspaper's record is vague, and I still don't know what kind of "organization" it is, what jurisdictional relationship it has with the hoarding of rice, and even less do I know the tone and attitude of the accountant when he confessed. Judging from the point of "presenting a set of documents," it seems very confident, although the newspaper uses the word "bribe."</p>
<p>"Bribes" certainly cannot "settle the matter," but the accountant was arrested, and what was presented was these "documents" obtained through bribery. Whether viewed from the front or the back, the hoarders at least believed that with the "documents" from the "organization," they had paid a "protection tax." Otherwise, knowing that bribery is a crime, why wouldn't the accountant fear the combination of two crimes, adding crime upon crime, and happily "present a set of documents" to confirm his crime?</p>
<p>Two hundred and thirty-five bags of hoarded rice were bribed with twelve dan of rice and six million legal tender. When converted, this protection tax almost cost a quarter of the profit. From the perspective of investing capital to seek profit, it was quite sophisticated to exchange for "a set of documents" for future use in case of an incident. Otherwise, why would these "documents" be so valuable? If these "documents" were originally intended for reporting, then why were they presented only after the hoarded rice was seized?</p>
<p>It can be seen that the use of "documents" is regarded by them as a guarantee of "attempting to sell at a high price," which means that the "high price" must also include the "25%" protection tax and its profits.</p>
<p>Now the hoarded rice has been seized, and the bribed legal tender and rice certainly cannot "settle the matter." The criminals have been sent to the garrison headquarters to "await legal action," so it seems there is more to come.</p>
<p>But will the tricks of hoarding and speculating disappear? This still depends on how the competent authorities deal with organizations similar to "a certain organization"!</p>
<p>From the period of occupation to this day, profiteering merchants have learned a concept from experience: if discovered, bribery is possible. And after bribery, it is secretly equivalent to paying a protection tax and having protection. When the truth comes out, the supervisor, in order to avoid too much involvement or to prevent family scandals from being exposed, will also "settle the matter."</p>
<p>Isn't that right? Today's rice hoarders copied the old article and presented the "a set of documents" of bribery. They and "a certain organization" had already "settled the matter" long ago.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>### The God of Wealth's Lost Treasure</h3>
<p>— Yang Mosu</p>
<p>The five Gods of Wealth in the Temple of the God of Wealth held a roundtable meeting. Taking advantage of the social and economic turmoil and the chaotic market, they prepared to launch offensives from all sides and unanimously engage in speculation. The first God of Wealth, with a golden face, took the lead, absorbing a large amount of gold, whether it was gold bars, gold nuggets, ingots, or gold ornaments, all of which were hoarded. He instructed his henchmen, "Bringing Wealth" and "Increasing Wealth," one busy weighing "ten thousand taels of gold," and the other busy measuring "daily income of a bucket of gold." The second God of Wealth, with a white face, was envious and immediately followed suit, hoarding grain and manipulating prices. The third God of Wealth, with a black face, was unwilling to be outdone, and spared no effort to search for and purchase US dollars, creating a black market situation of 20,000 to 1. The fourth God of Wealth, the Civil God of Wealth, frantically absorbed yarn shares, and the fifth God of Wealth, the Martial God of Wealth, followed suit by controlling public debt. The Temple of the God of Wealth was filled with a booming atmosphere. Ordinary poor people, with the belief that "being close to the rich will surely bring a small fortune," all flocked to the Temple of the God of Wealth to burn incense, long ingots, and bribe openly, hoping to get some light on the face of the Bodhisattva, which caused chaos and panic. This angered the local City God, who, upon the order of the King of Hell, took emergency measures, brought eight bailiffs, carrying a large abacus, and personally went to the Temple of the God of Wealth to settle accounts with the Gods of Wealth.</p>
<p>The five Gods of Wealth initially thought that "money is omnipotent," and that as long as they spoke about "favor" and entertained, there would be no problems. However, the City God was impartial and handled official matters according to the law. Seeing that the God of Wealth with a golden face was arrogant and snobbish, he first settled accounts with him, moving the large abacus beads. "You have a thousand calculations, but not as good as my one calculation." Ninety-nine eighty-one, the gold was confiscated and buried in the cellar, never to be reborn. From then on, gold became dirt, let's see how you can be active. The God of Wealth with a white face saw that the situation was not good and was originally the most timid. He voluntarily took out the hoarded rice and sold it to the public at the fair market price. However, the God of Wealth with a black face had been overseas before, could speak a foreign language, and had a dark heart. The City God moved the abacus beads and said, "Very well, the official price of US dollars will be 12,000 from today." The God of Wealth with a black face couldn't express his suffering and couldn't even say a word. The City God turned around, but couldn't find the Civil and Martial Gods of Wealth. He hurriedly asked "Bringing Wealth" and "Increasing Treasure." According to the answer, when the Lord was settling accounts with the three Gods of Wealth, they disguised themselves as poor people and secretly slipped out of the temple gate. The City God was furious and thought for a moment, saying, "I have a plan. Publish their real names in the newspaper, issue a strict warrant for their arrest, change the professions of 'Bringing Wealth' and 'Increasing Treasure' to make a living, expel them from the temple, and order Zhuo to seal the temple door with nails. The temple property will be confiscated, and half of each of the three large golden characters 'Temple of the God of Wealth' on the plaque in front of the door will be painted over, becoming 'Cai Shen Yue'." After everything was completed, he returned to the palace. The old people who burned incense before did not dare to raise their heads when passing by, and said in unison, "This measure allows us to 'Cai' speak a word for the poor."</p>
<h3>### Remembering Immortal Beauty</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Lingzhi</p>
<p>Don't say "lovers" should be practical, don't envy immortals for not being money! What is lingzhi? It's not as good as gold and is good-looking! Who wants it? It doesn't suit the hearts of the tycoons!</p>
<p>Note: Lingzhi is produced near Lover's Bridge. According to ancient legend, lingzhi is an immortal herb, and it is exhibited at the Shanghai Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, priced at 50 million yuan, but there are no customers.</p>
<h3>### Dialogue of Love</h3>
<p>— Kong Yuan</p>
<p>What is the most interesting question for anyone, whether Chinese or foreign, ancient or modern, male or female, old or young?</p>
<p>If you ask me this, I will answer you without hesitation with one word! "Love."</p>
<p>Have you read Plato's "Symposium"?</p>
<p>This great Greek philosopher, in the form of a play, used exquisite language to explain the true meaning of love with infinite wisdom and joy in a poetic way.</p>
<p>I want to learn from him.</p>
<p>Don't think I have too many love stories.</p>
<p>Every Valentine's Day, I always wander alone in my small room day and night.</p>
<p>This year's Valentine's Day, I recited a poem to myself, revised from a text:</p>
<p>"In front, I don't see spring flowers, behind, I don't see autumn moon; thinking of the悠悠 of love, I caress my chest alone and burst into tears."</p>
<p>You won't laugh at me? You may remember Tagore saying:</p>
<p>"If there were no flowers in the world, you would truly understand the love for flowers."</p>
<h3>### Memories of the Pear Garden's Old Green</h3>
<p>— Ting Song</p>
<p>The Gengzi Chronicle Poem by the Master of the Pingdeng Pavilion says: "Who cares about the rise and fall of the country? The streets are full of singing Jiao Tian'er." With these two sentences from the Qing Dynasty, one can understand the situation. However, in recent times, those who admire the Tan School call him Tan Xinpei the Great King, Tan Yingshou. In the mid-Guangxu period, we only knew him as Xiao Jiao Tian. Why is he called Xiao Jiao Tian? Because Tan's father was named Jiao Tian, and he was the son of Jiao Tian. After Jiashen, Guifen came to Shanghai, and after Gengzi, Juxian also came out of Beijing one after another. Tan's reputation rose sharply, and the situation of the three schools standing side by side changed to the Tan School dominating the stage alone. However, those who looked down on him said that he had no sound of great bells and chimes, like Zhou Ziheng, a gentleman from Tongrentang, who specialized in learning the big head. Every time after singing a song at the banquet, he would always make derogatory and disdainful remarks about Tan. There was also a Taoist priest from Sichuan, Huang, who also mixed in the capital, not a Taoist priest. He had a naturally rich voice and was good at the back of the head sound. I am very fond of Peking opera, and in social occasions, I knew that there were these two gentlemen at the banquet, either Zhou or Huang. I would definitely encourage the people at the same table to ask them to try their singing voice. As a layman, I listened attentively, and occasionally put my elbow on the table, and my wrist would vibrate. The magnitude of the two people's voices can be imagined. Therefore, those who knew Tan often laughed at him as the sound of national demise. In fact, it is not a fair comment, because Tan's singing focuses on charm, not on winning with a loud voice. At the same time as Sun, there was also a Xu Chu, whose appearance was extremely dignified and was best at Wang Mao opera. The volume of his voice was also comparable to that of Juxian, but there was no charm at all. The people of the capital ridiculed him as a donkey's bray, which was also abusive. He was the father of the martial artist Xu Deyi. Sun's singing was less charming than Zhu, and although the big head's charm was rich, it was naturally revealed, and there were also times when it was straightforward, far less than Tan's lingering and all-encompassing taste, without any regrets. The ancients said, "The lingering sound surrounds the beams," which is true, not just a reputation. It is said that Tan would repeatedly study and research the singing of Mu Ri when he was in a state of intoxication, and would only stop when he was satisfied. Therefore, in the second performance of a play, the lyrics would definitely have slight changes, because he was deliberately creating and improving day by day. He was like a good student, diligent and tireless, which is admirable. The only one who could get his charm was Xiao Yu, but even then it was only five or six out of ten. Those who achieved a little success by dipping into his leftovers were Meng Xiaodong. It is important that singing does not rely on the voice, but should focus on pursuing charm as the foundation.</p>
<h3>### Shaw's Clever Reply</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The great producer Goldwyn once discussed with Shaw the purchase of the film rights to Shaw's various plays. Shaw bargained closely and refused to let go, making it impossible for Goldwyn to lower the price, so the negotiations seemed difficult to succeed. Finally, Gao said, "Think about it, as long as it is made into a film, millions of people who have read your play will be able to see it. For the contribution to art, please sacrifice a little."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," the old man replied, "you only think of art, and I only think of money!"</p>
<h3>### Art and Literary Circles</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>The location shooting team of "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains," led by Fei Mu, went to Pian Zhen for the third time yesterday and will be completed by the end of March.</p>
<p>It is reported that the new film "Grassland Loyal Souls" of "Triumph" has been decided to be directed by Ma Xuwibang, starring Qian Qiuhua, the heroine of "Regret of Spring River."</p>
<p>Lan Zhajia, who recently returned to Shanghai from Taiwan, talks and laughs with people in high spirits, and promotes the beauty of Taiwan's scenery, excellent climate, and smooth work in a promotional tone, inviting people to visit and is willing to be the host.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli, who is known for his tension, is very serious and hardworking when directing "Eight Years of Separation." Every time he finishes shooting a small section, he must go to Cai Chusheng's residence in Hongkou to discuss and seek improvement.</p>
<p>La Fei "Audience's" "Peace and Woman" has been performing very well, and it has been decided to continue the performance until the 23rd, after which "The Return of the Soul," directed by Zuo Lin, will be staged.</p>
<p>Hong Mu used his directing fee for Wen Tianxiang to buy a second-hand motorcycle, paying 80 pounds. Now that the goods have arrived, he plans to resell it for 135 pounds. Someone calculated for him that, converted at the official price, he could get about 5 million yuan. If he sells it, Hong Mu can be said to be a Tao Zhu reborn and has a way of making money.</p>
<p>Zhao Dan has recently gained a nickname at the photography field, called: "Wine, Sex, Money, and Temperament Director."</p>
<p>The Chinese Drama Society's "True and False Aunt" will be staged at the Lyceum Theater from the 18th. The actors include Han Fei, Bai Mu, and Zhang Fa. The directing work of this play is collectively discussed and executed by the actors. Hong Mu is only listed in name.</p>
