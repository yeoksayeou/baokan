<h3>新闢財產稅　政府考慮中</h3>
<p>營利所得稅個別稽征</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕新聞財產稅，政府已在考慮中。直接我檢討會議中，曾就技術及理論觀點，作初步討論，主張征收財產稅，應以銀行存款，外匯，黃金，房屋土地爲對象，不應以人爲對象；贈予稅亦應以財產爲對象又息，特種營業稅自本年度起，由中央徵收。央行以外之銀行事業，保險事業，信託事業，全國性及國際性之交通事業，均爲課稅之對象。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電」營利所得稅將於本年度起恢復個別稽征。按各商號之征稅，過去即着重查賬辦法，抗戰期間因物價波動，資本營利均失其眞實性，故採用估計辦法。惟此項辦法，日久乃生弊端，形成變相攤派性質，影響政府稅收，故決定恢復查賬稽征，俾便增加稅收而妥定稅制。此一辦法將在大都市實行。至各偏僻地區，則仍按簡化稽征手續辦理。財部現特招考特種稅收人員，設立查賬講習會，對現有人員予以調練，分發各地工作。上海地區因工商機構衆多，人員不够分配，故得向央行借調技術人員工作。</p>

<h3>中美農業技術合作團　報告書公開發表　農林部正研擬實施方案</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕中美農業技術合作團，自去年十一月問完成各項工作，當經中美變方團員會固編製報吿書。該報吿書就我國農業狀况，叙述至詳，且對我國此後農萊建設，農村復典，以及農業行政方面，提出建議方案甚多·實為中美雙方對於此後農萊技術合作方面一最重要之文獻。該報吿書經中美雙方團員分別呈送兩國政府核閱，以內容廣泛關係較多，迄未能公開發表，以供國人參老。現悉中美兩國政府經泆定於本月廿四日將該報吿書公開發表，至於根據各項建議之初步實施方案，正由農林部會同有關機關研緩中。該團報吿書之提要如下：</p>
<p>中國農業建設計劃，關係全國之繁榮綦深，必須配合適當，華新精進，始克奏效。中國國民衣食住行之所需，大部賴諸農產品，故凡影響於農業者即將影響於百分之七十五以上之農民生活，亦即將影寗於全國每一人民之幸福。本團深信完善之農業計劃，對於農民物資及精神生活，當有切實之改進，亦即大有助於中國內政問題之根本解決。</p>
<p>農業與工業如轉車相依，若不兼籌並購，等量齊進，則兩者皆不能高度發展。中國工業品之最大消費者為農民，而農民消費力之大小，全視其購買力之强弱，即其經濟是否寬裕，故農業之改進，必須與工業之發展同時並進，庶工業產品可有廣大之銷路，且發展工桀，必須自外國輸入一部份機器，即需外匯，戰前中國之農產品出佔外銷總額百分之七十，故農產為換取外匯之主要來源，是則凡可以促進外銷農產品之生產，加工運輸者，即所以助長工業之建設，亦即所以增進全國人民之福利也。</p>
<p>本團深信上述之改進，均可見諸事實。由實地觀察所得，中國若能應用最新科學方法，如改進作物，土壤，牲畜及農具等，大可增進農業生產；再如租個農貸運銷等之改進，更可增加農民之收益，而目下農村社會之窮困，亦得藉以减除。</p>
<p>建議內容</p>
<p>本團深感目前農民環境之艱困，欲謀解決，必須有完善之計劃，配以合理健全之組織，妥作左列建議：</p>
<p>（一）於化學肥料工廠之建設，農田水利之發展，作物牲畜品種之改進及其病虫害之防治建築，及薪炭林木之增產，果蔬魚肉之生產等，應特加注意。（二）於外匯率之調整，農貸利率及運費之减低，外銷農產品如桐油·絲·茶·羊毛等之生產與輸出之獎勵，及其有開工業停歇之復興等，當取緊急措施。（三）於低利農貨之大量供給，若干區域佃租制度之改進，土地測量登記與估價之實施，卅五年中央政府頒佈有關地稅問題，土地法之執行等，當力謀進行。（四）於外銷及內銷農產品之標準，分級檢騐檢疫及市塲管制等，應進行實施。（五）於農林福利有關之國民教育，分公共衛生·保遠·交通、浚河·防洪等，應積極推進。（六）於各分區內之農學院與農事試騐塲之聯繫，當由農林部與教育部切實合作，力求實現。至現有之農業推廣委員會，當由農林部改組為中央農業推廣總局，並於省縣區內各設推廣機構。（七）於全國分設九區，每區選擇一中心地點，各設一農學院，一農事試騐塲，一農業推廣處，一農業圖書館，負責協導該區內各省之農產教育研究及推廣工作。此項區中心地點，擬定為南京，北平，長春，蘭州，武功，成都，武昌，廣州，台北等九處。（八）於農林部內成立中央農業管制總局，並在全國設立十六個分局。（九）將現有之中國農民銀行及中央合作金庫，加以合併，成立一國家農業銀行，以供給各種農業金融之需要。（十）由社會部籌議適當辦法，用政府力量，防止人口之激增。</p>
<p>上項建議之完成，非一蹴可幾，本團認為各機關之發展，須視適當人才之能否羅致而定緩急，為培植此項人才，擬請資送有望之工作人員出國潔造。</p>
<p>為實施上項建議，農業建設經費必須大量增加，衡以中國農業與全國國民福利關係之密切，本團深信此種大量經費之增加，殊不為過。</p>
<p>本團希望上述建議內若干事業，可為將來中美兩國農業合作之肇始。</p>

<h3>評議物價的再實施</h3>
<p>依「經濟緊急措施方案」四項穩定物價原則所擬訂的「評議物價實施辦法」，業經國防最高委員會通過送由政府實施。這個辦法是政府穩定物價的程序法，而穩定物價的方法，是採行評議政策，分析言之，乃「評定」與「議價」的政策。這個政策在抗戰期間曾經施用，因理論上缺乏科學技術而失敗了。經濟部廿八年二月廿日公佈之「非常時期評定物價及取締投機操縱辦法」，亦戰時評議物價政策之全貌。這次行政院所提的「評議物價實施辦法」，內容和精神，與戰時的辦法多少相同；而不全同，實施於今日的情况，有待商榷之處甚多。爰就所見，批評如下：</p>
<p>（一）評議機構：依實施辦法規定，有評議物價必要之地方組織物價評議會，由主管局長（指社會局而言）及參議會·商會·工會·工商同業公會·及治安機關會同組織七人至十一人之委員會，職掌主要民生日用必需品之售價，并協助檢舉違反議價之行為，是為地方主宰物價之最高權力機構。惟議價政策的精神，應在於公定及公平；對生產者固應如此，對消費者更應如此。。商會暨同業公會係代表生產者，政府暨治安機關係代表權力者；僅有工會代表勤勞大衆的消費者，如果議價要求公定公平，應以生產者與消費者雙方利益兼顧為原則。原有「非常時期評定物價及取締投機操縱辦法」，相當注意及此，所以將來的物價評價會應多增人民團體之代表，以代表多數勤勞大眾之消費者而發言，始有公平可言。</p>
<p>（二）評價標準：依實施辦法規定，應行議價之物品，以主要民生日用必需品為準，食鹽除外，按照物品成本，視當地各業向例，分別酌加利潤成數。價格經評議核定，卽山政府公吿；如物品成本發生劇烈變動時再議。像這個議價標率，有幾點可注意：（二）要評定議定的物價，僅以主要民生日用品為限，共他物品價格又如何管制如何穩定呢？好像凍結民生日用品價格，而不凍結其他；（二）評定方法是以成本為標準，不以市塲價格為標準，理論上是為成本評價，按成本是缺乏統一律的，同一商品因生產關係之不同，生產成本有高低；生產者因組織及運用之不同，利息運費管理費及折耗等亦有高低；其中微妙錯綜，物價評價會將何以求乎？如以成本高之物品，作某種物品價格之評議，結果保護了小企業，也便宜了大企業，如以成本低之物品作標準，評議的結果是保護了大企業，而損害了小企業。其他如會計上的間題也很多；昔日大後方評議物價的沉痛經騐，豈堪回憶！（三）依「經濟緊急措施方案」的規定，物價指數應凍結於本年一月份，無疑評議時應以此為標準，而實施辦法又承認因成本發生劇烈變動時可以再議，好像承認物價有上漲的因素。是這樣，物價評議會仍不能凍結物價；必須隨時絆看這匹無覇的野馬。</p>
<p>（三）懲處問題：依實施辦法規定，凡遠反核定之議價者，得依「取締違反限價議價條例」懲處·按此一條例，係三十四年二月十五日國府公佈施行，立法根據為「國家總動員法」第八條之規定，也可說它是總動員法的子法。如所週知，「國家總動員法」乃戰時之緊急法，强制法，對於人民權利和自由的束甚大，現在對日作戰勝利，情况變遷，去年國防最高委員會通過修廢四十八種法冷中，一國家總動員法」「妨害國家總勁員懲罰暫行條例」同為廢止的法規；從法理上說，母法廢止，子法亦應失時效。今次「評義物價實施辦法」又授權地方政府，復活了「取締述反限價議價條例」，這是立法技術的缺憾，也是實施辦法所含的緊急性過重，未提付立法院完成立法程序時的遺憾。關於這一點，如果行政當局不予救濟，將「取締違反限價議價條例」修改，或重付立法字，未免有團國　棗之嫌煩。茍缺乏此一步驟，將來受懲處者，依法可以行訴願的。</p>
<p>以上僅就实施办法重要幾項加以批評，他如實施評價時在技術上可能發生的問題尙多；如何運用才算合理，這就是看地方政府的行政能力了，否則，所謂穏定物價評議物價，在低能的行政者執行起來，堆有步入「以湯止沸，以薪救火」的失敗之路面已。</p>

<h3>四強軍政府制訂法律　解散普魯士聯邦　杜絕納粹軍國主義復活　擬具報告下月提交莫斯科外長會議</h3>
<p>〔合眾社柏林廿三日電〕四強德境軍事司令官今日已草擬一法律，正式解散普魯士聯邦，該地為歷史上德國軍國主義之誕生地。此項法律將無須呈交四國德境佔領軍政府之盟國管制委會作最後批準。四強國軍事司令官在本月廿三日照常進行會議，并獲致一協議，即四國久爭未決之肅清納粹及軍國主義之報告，將提交莫斯科外長會議。報告之內容尚未透露，但悉，四強對此或表示滿意。前此蘇聯會拒絕交出其任何活靈活現納粹之情報，致僵持達一星期之久。蘇聯并反對「解散普魯士聯邦」不能由管制委會作主，但允許提交莫斯科外長會議辦理。</p>
<p>英美佔區經濟合作　獲得德四聯邦支持</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林廿三日電〕新裭委為德境美軍軍事長官之克萊中將今日稱：英美兩區經濟合併，業已獲得美佔領區中之德國四聯邦保證，表示完全擁護與合作。克萊此項聲明，乃在巴威略，赫斯，及胡頓堡—巴頓之行政長官與白萊門之市長會商後而發。克萊與及其軍政府之官員曾與德官員討論各聯邦政府與兩新合併區經濟機構間之關係。據稱，「此次討論極屬滿意，因其確已澄清兩方之關係。結果吾人已自美佔領區之內四聯邦獲得保證，對吾人所主張之經濟完整與合作，一致擁擠。」</p>
<h3>法副總理闡明　對德計劃綱要　魯爾工業區歸國際管理　蕯爾與法實行經濟合併</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社都隆港廿三日電〕法副總理即共黨領袖陶萊士，本日在此間市中心自由廣場向群眾發表演說，指斥盟國減少自魯爾區連往法國之煤斤，置法國之需要於不顧，反予德國之復興以優先之權，陶萊士并闡述一項對於解決德國問題之計劃，將由法國向莫斯科四外長會議提出，其要點凡五：即（一）立即完全肅清德國及其他各處之納粹主義；（二）立即解除德國軍備；（三）銷毀德國之戰爭工業，并嚴格統制其所保留之重工業；（四）魯爾區之國際化；（五）蕯爾區在經濟上與法國合併。陶氏之言有曰，法國之整個將來國在七十五年內遭德國侵略，前後已有三次，吾國人以及全世界知恥之人士，務須明瞭吾人應採取措施，務使能保護吾國抵抗侵略實屬絕對必要。關於自魯爾區之國際化，該區會為一泛日耳曼主義之戰爭兵工廠，故應由國際機關加以管理，專為曾遭德國侵略各國之復興而工作。吾人獲致安全之權利以及吾人所提之賠款要求，實乃一而二二而一者也。吾人當然不承認吾人希望復興德國而不希望本國復興，魯爾區之國際化可使法國取得煤斤之供應。以言蕯爾區，法國始終要求與該區在經濟上實行合併，但吾人不欲違反蕯爾區人民之意志，而將該區歸併，吾人所要求者厥為正義而已。吾人從未誤認德國人民全為希特勒，但德人民必須承認其引起他國蒙受損失之責任。</p>
<p>英法締盟　延宕原因</p>
<p>在於法國之同盟制度，吾人希望在英蘇盟約之外再加一英法盟約。英法盟約遲未能締結，其主要原因厥由於英國對於吾人在德國問題中之利益，發生誤解有以致之。列強之問必須樹立諒解，列強間之必要，對於確保鞏固與持久之和平，自亦不可缺少云。</p>
<h3>土耳其重視　莫斯科會議</h3>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕莫斯科外長會之籌備，已在順利進展中。四強外長之德奧問題代表將於星期一及星期二正式採納將向外長會議提出之報告書。奧國問題尚有兩主要問題未曾協議，即疆界及奧境資金之定議。關於德和約之準備程序，關於小國參加之程度，四強意見亦尚分歧。頃就一般徵象觀之，莫斯科外長　會雖曰僅以討論德奧問題為限，然關於修正式訂閱盟約之外交活動，屆時或亦不免，如英法盟約，法捷，法波盟約之訂立，以及英蘇盟約之修改等，均將成為莫斯科會議正式議程以外之活動目標。</p>
<h3>真納堅持印回分治</h3>
<p>〔聯合社喀拉嗤廿三日電〕回教同盟領袖真納今日在此間發表演說，謂回盟對於印回分治之要求，決不退讓一吋。此乃英政府發表聲明後真納之首次公開聲明，但并未直接提及英國聲明。真納稱：「皮哈爾及其他地點回教徒所受之困苦，明白昭示吾人應在印度之內有一回教獨立國。皮哈爾省回教徒多所犧牲，余引以自豪。此輩之犧牲決非徒然，彼等使分治之目標愈接愈近，并表示準備為到達此目標而繼續犧牲。」同時新德里方面回教獨立派領袖馬斯里基稱：英軍規定之退出日期，乃為對回教徒大屠殺之開端。英國之聲明乃偽裝之惡作劇。</p>

<h3>安理會議程</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿三日電〕聯合國安全理事會各代表今日充滿希望，認為可在本星期中結束原子管制問題現階段之討論，同時解決英國與阿爾巴尼亞之糾紛。本週安理會之工作重心如下：</p>
<p>（一）阿爾巴尼亞事件可於廿四日詩集結束，或在週末另一次會議中結束。（二）原子管制事件，於廿五日討論後，將交回原子能委員會，令其再接再厲，調和美蘇兩國之見解，以免兩國在安理會中對於原子委員會之初步建議實行攤牌。（三）美國要求太平洋方面前日本委任統治　歸聯合國代管一案，或將於廿六日提付討論。聞美國代表要斯準備要求以些案列入是日議會，但主管人士稱奧氏鑒於英蘇兩國之反對，不擬要求立即接受此案。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾支持艾克遜　或不答覆蘇新照會　艾氏決無辭職問題發生</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿三日電〕此間官方本晚預料，國務卿馬歇爾將堅決魂魄副國務卿區克遜之言論，即「蘇聯採取侵略性與擴展性之外交政策」。此間官方并稱：馬歇爾對區克遜本月十日在參院原子能委員會中所發表之言論，已表明立場，故深信馬氏仍將堅持到底。政府官員談稱：莫斯科廣播所稱莫洛托夫已以新照會送呈馬歇爾一節，美國尚未接得。莫斯科廣播有謂：莫洛托夫之新照會闡明蘇聯不能接受馬歇爾對區克遜言論之辯護，外交界相信如果馬氏準備答覆此項新照會，則不過重申前言而已，但馬氏將否予以答覆，尚有疑問。</p>
<p>若干官員梗就此項很熱對莫斯科外長會議可能有何影響一點第一次表示意見，認為馬歇爾與莫洛托夫在莫斯科會議時即將有惡劣之開始，其他人士認為馬莫二氏不過在莫斯科會議前欲先聲奪人而已，此項爭執不致有何嚴重性云。</p>
<p>據此特殊方面之人士稱：渠等認為莫活托夫此次之照會，乃為克里姆林宮方面對馬歇爾任國務卿後之一種試探。又稱：馬氏對艾克遜失言之答覆，莫斯科方面已發覺渠等所開始欲發覺之事，即馬歇爾為一不可能為莫斯科方面強硬手段所易恫嚇之人也。又據渠等指出，尼日爾始終為一軍人，而其為政治家，乃由環境造成，故渠定將奮門至最後一息。另有其他方面認為蘇使用壓力，促艾克遜辭職，但馬歇爾立即公開為艾克遜辯護，此足表示渠始終將支持艾克遜，而艾氏亦決無辭職問題發生云。</p>

<h3>納粹驚人陰謀　竟以疫病細菌威脅英人　圖迫英國參加反蘇戰爭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：此次德地下秘密體密謀恢復德國，規模甚大，今日英當局在其德境佔區內續捕納粹黨人多名，并發現其極大之秘密。據英方目前納粹細菌學專家羅森堡所獲之證據，德方準備向英建議組織「西綫集團」以細菌向蘇聯作戰，否則納粹黨徒將以疫病細菌毀滅倫敦。該專家羅森堡曾函英當局，要求恢復德國軍力，否則將以秘密出售與蘇聯。羅森堡稱：德方派員十二人即可消滅倫敦，派員六十人，即可消滅全英國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿三日電〕美英佔領軍今日破獲大規模納粹地下運動，其中工作人員陰謀以秘密細菌武器，屠殺佔領軍。被捕者已有數百人，其中有前德國陸軍上校一名，曾於上次戰爭由參與軍機。此乃戰後破獲之最大陰謀案，範圍廣及兩佔領區。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿四日電〕美英佔領軍當局昨夜繼續逮捕德人，俾擊碎地下納粹陰謀，傳說此陰謀廣達德國全境，旨在重振德國武力，以「領導歐洲各國對抗蘇聯」。被捕納粹份子包括逃亡之衝鋒隊軍官多名，自稱有秘密細菌武器。諜報官員對被捕者數百人，嚴加盤結，以期探取綫索，緝獲該地下團體之次要陰謀。美軍官員稱，地下團體總部顯然在英軍防區內。</p>

<h3>遠東軍法庭重行開庭　日律師尚圖狡辯　信口雌黃欲以一手掩盡天下耳目</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿四日電〕遠東國際法庭今日復庭，進入辯護階段。日辯護律師清　首先提出綜合辯護文，該論文係經日美全體辯護律師詳細校訂者。其要點如下：（一）基於國家主權之行動，個人并無責任；（二）戰前之教育及作戰計劃，并非準備侵略，而係由於普遍的倫理及經濟情形。（三）所謂共榮團等，并非侵略性質，日本人之特殊感情，有被誤會之處；（四）共同謀義之觀念，僅見於英美法，國際法上并不成立；（五）在戰爭犯罪之觀念中加入有關和平及人道之罪，并不妥當；（六）基於戰爭之殺人罪，并不妥當；（七）東北事變及中日事變，係對挑撥發動自衛權；（八）三國同盟及對蘇準備，純屬防禦性質；（九）太平洋戰爭用當時日美關係之必然結果，純屬自衛戰爭；（十）珍珠港事件，美於事前亦因聽無綫電，充分知悉其事，此項通告具有開戰宣言之內容，其所以於開戰後通告者，并非日政府之意，實出於不得已；（十一）謂珍珠港事件係偷襲，實屬不當。</p>
<h3>辯護文內容</h3>
<p>辯護文稱日本朝野對中國之自存與發展，極予同情，明治中葉以來即招來多數中國留學生，蔣主席即為其中之一人，一九一一年之中國革命以來，日本朝野對孫文先生之志業，極表好意，誠如檢察官所指摘，參謀本部確曾每年擬定作戰計劃，獨　　中國從未樹立此種全面的，假定的作戰計畫。東北事變，中日事變，及太平洋戰爭，均係具體原因各不相同之別種事件，其間并無一貫之計畫。日本從未預料與中國從事全面門爭，故無全盤計畫。文中并狡辯稱：日本因人口眾多，土地狹小，兼因美國限制移民，故不得不在中國東北取得特殊利益，當時東北政權與日本密切合作，以維持勢力，嗣後因全中國恢復國權運動抬頭，東北情況亦發生變化。及國民黨在東北設立支部後，中日間糾紛，逐漸增加，檢察官認為一九三一年九月十八日晚炸毀鐵路事件，係日方所策謀，實屬非是。「滿洲國」之出現，乃由東北人民自動發生之運動。蘆溝橋事變發生之責任，不在日方，該事變當時倘能就地解決，即不致擴大，當時日本堅持不擴大方針，所要求者僅係華北之明朗化，及其他地方放棄抗日政策。一九三二年，中國方面不顧上海停戰協定，在非武裝地帶構築陣地，集中五萬餘軍隊於上海，當時駐滬日海軍陸戰隊不足四千人，華中之戰門如是發生。日本對中國并無經濟侵略。同時經濟侵略本身并非犯罪。日本一部分部隊在中國所作殘忍行為，實屬遺憾，然事實被過分袴張，且有若干揑造之處。</p>
<h3>法庭激烈舌戰</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕國際軍事法庭今日開審時，庭長魏勃與被告有激烈舌戰，皆因被告律師重新搏擊法庭之規章，轄權·及國際公法之解釋而起，爭辯之烈實為去歲四月日戰犯被控以來所罕見。魏勃直接命令被告前企劃院總裁鈴木之律師高柳在其辯詞中，除去有關法律或邊權問題，舌戰始告停止。魏勃稱；法庭規章，限制被告在此階段僅可陳述證據。前首相平沼年八十，為被告中之年齡最長者，於午後開庭法官入座時，未能起立，即被扶出檢驗，醫生謂平沼之狀況并不嚴重。</p>
<h3>重光土肥原等人　反對清瀨辯護文</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京二十四日電〕遠東國際法庭被告重光，廣田，平沼，土肥魘，鈴木等五人今日聲明完全不同意辯護律師清瀨所怦辯護文，并聲明保留日後各自單獨陳述之權。又被告大島表示不造成其中一部分。今日庭內燈光輝耀，攝影機聲不絕，倍形熱鬧，貴賓席，傍聽席均告客滿。</p>

<h3>德國著名科學家　談原子秘密</h3>
<p>原子彈重二十磅，大小如排球。其中分為兩半個，每半個絕對安全，但如合併，一剎那間即天翻地覆</p>
<p>〔聯合社德國哥丁根廿三日電〕德國第一流原子科學家海森堡曾獲一九三二年度諾貝爾物理獎金，今日宣稱：蘇聯曾以六千盧布一月，招請德國原子科學家為之研究，現已有三人應聘，月薪按外交官兌換率計算，約合美金五百元。海氏并稱：製造原子彈，在任何國家現為工程問題，不復為科學問題。德國曾於戰爭末期藏有鈾堆，後被美國間諜人員盜去。此項鈾堆原擬用以製造原子能，以供給機器動力，而非用以製造原子炸彈。當時藏在斯都加特南四十哩之海傑洛地方者計有鈾兩噸，重水兩噸，黑船十噸。現在全世界已知具有爆炸性之　，係自鈾堆產生。海傑洛係於一九四五年由法軍佔領，惟法軍一無所獲，全部鈾堆皆由美國科學諜報人員於法軍未知前運去，及至查明後，法軍聞之頗不慊。</p>
<p>海氏及為納粹政府共同研究鈾原質之助手六人，現在此間英軍管理下研究宇宙綫。英國官方近勸其勿應阿根廷京師大學之請，前往講學，謂此事必不能邀準，其理由甚明。</p>
<p>海氏并稱：現在蘇聯某處工作之德科學家三人，一為虎茲教授，曾為德國製造原子分裂器以擊破原子，并為自鈾分出同位元素鈾二三五之權威科學家。尚有兩人，一為萊比塞物理學家杜泊爾，一為予之戰時助手貝維洛加博士。去年九月，蘇聯佔領區某德人曾以蘇聯政府名義，面邀予赴蘇參加工作。待遇除月薪六千盧布外，每月尚可特別配給鮮肉五十磅，子女六人，每人每日配給食物三十五百加羅里，此外并有舒適住宅一所，一切免費。予甚願留居國內，故當時曾婉辭謝絕。予且不願為任何人研究製造原子彈，如欲出國，亦不過作短期遊歷，發表數次演講，絕不願從事於殺人利器。</p>
<p>予以同僚三人，在戰爭結束未久，即往蘇聯。其中貝維活加博士一時曾在克里米亞工作，旋復突然調往他處。若蜚現在何處，予不能斷定，大致在烏拉爾山附近。入籍美國之義大利科學家弗爾米博士亦曾邀予加入「芝加哥團體」未果。予現在唯一心願無非欲在美國講學若干時，一如予在戰前所為，對於造彈之事，則絕不願　聞。</p>
<p>美國對於原子彈製造經過情形所發表之「史密斯報告書」，予曾讀過，予對於如何製造原子彈，除若干技術方面之細則外，大致已瞭然。美國軍界，以「史密斯報告書」受科學家壓力而公之於世，致洩漏秘密，頗為不滿。予以「史密斯報告書」為根據，可知原子彈重二十磅，大小如排球。其中分兩半個，每半個絕對安全，即使置入火爐亦無危險。但如將兩半個合併，則一剎那間即起爆炸，造成天翻地覆之局面。</p>
<p>海森堡曾任威廉大帝物理研究所長，戰時德國所有原子研究悉由其主持，據稱：德國研究成就可與美國并駕齊驅，及至一九四二年六月局勢始變。是年六月六日，吾人曾在一決定性之會議席上報告軍備部長史比爾，謂原子可用兩　使之爆炸，一即自鈾分出同位元素鈾二三五，一即造成鈾堆。徒以希特勒心情暴燥，問吾人何時可以成功，吾人答曰兩年或兩年以上。惟希特勒對於任何越過六個月之軍事計劃，均不耐考慮。其時希特勒正想取得高加索油場及蘇彝士運河。總之，製造原子彈須有極大規模之工業設備，德國則付閱如，此其致命打擊云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿三日電〕德國科學家海森堡宣布蘇聯招請德國原子科學家事，此間認為此舉并不足以產生原子炸彈，蘇聯科學家於原子炸彈之原理方面，其所知殆已不亞於德科學家。海氏謂其製造原子彈關鍵大部份在工程方面，此言并不十分透澈，有一問題更偏於科學方面，而不盡屬於工程方面，即如何在高速度下配合鈾或鎮之碎塊以供其發生爆炸。</p>

<h3>收購黃金數達二千餘條　信大紗號投機查實　山西幫巨頭之一孫子信畏罪潛逃　首批黑單中有官吏一人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金潮時期中投機買賣黃金之大戶，業經經濟監察團查獲實據者，已有信大紗號一家。該號曾於一月廿二日至二月十五日之間，買進黃金達二千二百十九條之鉅。其經理孫子信，係山西雀平遙縣人，為本市黃金掮客中所謂「山西帮」巨頭之一。據悉渠購進黃余後，均以飛機裝運外埠牟利。經監團數度偵查後，發現確體，但該孫子信竟已畏罪潛逃，宣團長昨特下令通緝案案交華法處嚴懲。又悉，經監團密呈蔣主席之首批黑單中，有利用公款作黃金投機之現任官吏一人，其買賣黃金數量，亦達數千條之多。據悉主席據呈後極為震怒，已批示即予拘捕嚴辦，但經監團負責人昨尙未肯透露此一「老虎」之姓名身份，及是否業已拘獲等情。又悉，該員從事黃金買賣為數至鉅，其服務之機關係在外埠，本人則在上海活動。預料經監團拘獲後，將交軍事法庭審訊。</p>

<h3>京滬車鉅刦案　四十四小時破獲　單身劇盜飛躍出車　攜賊逃匿醫院就擒</h3>
<p>本月廿一日下午六時，第十五次快車自京駛滬，行經西巷與陸家浜之間時，有旅客陸淇南及劉景成者，所攜現鈔一皮箱，計一千五百萬元，忽被同車身着制服佩帶符號之匪徒，持械刦去刦後且　不顧身，即從車上躍下，逃逸無蹤。失主於車抵上海北站後，即投報警務處。王兆槐處長得報後，大為眞怒，以兩路自有史以來，僅有　案，從未有於車上白畫行刦之盜案，因即令分段長張漢英，檢事員閔建初，負責緝捕。張於奉命後，當遺巡官帥英率幹員二十餘人，分頭跴緝後，於距離鐵路綫四十八里之沙島葛鄉地頭浦王自新家查得綫索。</p>
<p>蓋該匪刦款躍下後，即受重傷，當時知有警務人員緝捕，即携款勉强逃逸，於當晚逃至沙葛鄉王自新家，以法幣三萬元借宿一夜，復以十五萬元代價購得綫呢條子棉袍一件，將原穿軍衣易下，連同一凶器丟入糞缸內，即於次日携款雇小船一艘，至夏家橋，再於陸家浜乘火車來滬。警務人員探獲此重大綫索後，即運夜返滬，根據辦案經騐，知該匪身受重傷，勢必就醫，因至各醫院密查。</p>

<p>第三，政府為了安定民生，最近頒佈「經濟緊急措施方案」。這是一種應爭民辦法，這個方案，雖能攙救了目前經濟危機，可是與利必須除幣，因此未能盡如人意，野心份子又在乘機造謠，惡意的中傷。須知今天的政府，是人民的政府，無時不以廣大民衆的疾苦為念，無處不在為人民謀福利，縱所頒方案，有須增　之處，我想循政府亦必定尊重民意，而有所考慮，這一點，希　各位同志加以注意。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕地政局最近接獲要求免除地價稅之呈文甚多。其申請人包括同業公會，私立學校，私立慈善團體，被政府機關接收使用或被流民佔用搭建棚之之土地業主等等。現悉該局之處理辦法如下：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案火首沈秋麟夫婦，經警局以公共危險罪移送地檢處偵查究辦，茲經沈祖壽檢察官偵查終結，認為沈沈氏罪嫌不足，予以不起訴處分，沈秋麟則依刑法一百七十三條第二項之罪嫌提起公訴。其起訴書稱：「沈秋麟租屋於戈登路武定路四二五號開設銅匠店，上年十月間以電綫太舊乃自行裝換，惟其對於此道，非其所長，裝置技術不免拙劣，且房屋破舊，逢雨天，屋頂漏水，電綫即受潮濕。本年一月廿二日天又下雨，是日下午九時卅分，因電綫被水浸受潮以致走電，延燒屋頂木板起火，經警局調查認為有失火嫌疑，移送偵查到處，被吿沈秋麟對於上年十月間自行裝換電綫，及每逢雨天即被水浸受潮一點已供認·查電綫受潮即易走電，為最普通之常議，該屋所裝之電綫既每日為雨浸而受潮，自應早為修理，防患於未然，乃竟漫不注意，且該被吿對於裝置電綫幷無專到之研究，其技術之不良已可想見，設或當時電綫裝置得宜，或不致遽成災患。該被吿對於此種普通應有之常識，應注意而不注意，實有刑法一百七十三第三二項之罪嫌，自雖任其倖免，合依刑事訴訟法二百卅條第一項提起公訴。檢察官沈祖壽」。</p>

<p>蔡陸曾〔十五比六十五比三〕奚　綦</p>
<p>高級單打</p>

<p>愛司谷〔十五比二十五比〇〕李敦甫</p>
<p>高級雙打</p>
<p>第三塲為高級雙打、洪德全倪元一對勃司基上尉與地山奴兩人，七時二十分交鋒，兩番將開紀錄，惟洪倪因防守得法，即以四比一佔上風，五比三時，互相往返失攻，似頗緊張，洪之技術較倪為佳，奔跑迎擊，莫不努力，在彼等得十一分時，對方急起直追，打成各十四分平身，洪倪擇三定勝負，先入關中，以十八比十四贏首局。</p>
<p>教十下來回，華方打破空氣，地山奴發球每不如意，上尉則球出似流星，反以一分（八比七）超出，局面一變，斯時競爭最烈，兩客將風頭十足，十二比九相差三分，强弓硬　，以十五此十一扳回一局。兩軍汗流浹背。　三局兩勝制，遂作第三局之爭奪戰，初戰各二，運環進攻，突增至吿七，洪倪八比七，佔先一着，易地再戰，有時各用經挑巧勁，繼成十三比八，兩番迭用妙計，追至十二分，不幸數次重擊，越底綫，勝利終屬洪倪，比數係十五比十二，</p>

<p>昨米糧南北市到源共計一萬七千七百餘石，市况依然平穩。粳米高貨彷彿，中下略呈軟化，秈米則貨稀堅挺，白元亦少榮辱，陰元提高殺次。</p>
<p>油市內地報漲，店胃轉濃。豆油續升一萬餘元，生油亦加萬元，蔴油跟漲三五千元。豆餅外埠去化見淡，先堅後回，市勢平正。麵粉消化尚可回升千元，市情乍升乍降，趨入盤旋之局。麩皮鄉莊實消轉暢，挺進二三千元。</p>
<p>黃豆亦然早緊午懈，開盤漢口豆及杜豆均一致續漲二三千元，但收市均乏交易，形勢轉疲。東北大豆無甚軒輊。</p>

<h3>市價高於收價　秋絲收不踴躍</h3>
<p>中信開始收買秋絲後，初因市價低於收價，故各廠解交之秋絲及零烘春絲之數量頗多，自一月份至二月中旬由中蠶公司收解之數字，共計一千三百擔左右，旋因市價高於收價，以致各廠紛向市塲拋售，故自二月中旬起，收解工作又趨停頓。</p>
<h3>麵包餅干業　請增配粉數量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據麵粉商業同業公會負責人語記者：該會近據麵包餅乾業陳請，略以同業每日需粉量爲二千包，而每日實配額僅九百〇五包。同時民生食堂焙製平價麵包，每日需粉量爲五十包，而每日實配額僅十二包。而查切麵業方面，每日領取配粉量達四千五百包，切麵業每日每家最多廿包，圾少一包，實際每日可有餘額一千餘包。故刻正考慮如何以此多餘之配額，移補麵包餅乾及民生食堂所短少之粉額云。</p>
<h3>市面頭寸漸鬆　游資轉向地產</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金融界某要員稱：本市頭寸已鬆，游資除以股票市塲爲對象外，已有向地產活動之趨勢。在公家之立塲，最希望游資能存入銀行；此而不可能，則希望其不向有害民生之途徑活動，故游資如向地產活動，不失爲佳訊。以掛牌利率而論，本市有人主張提高，但站在政府立塲上，此與工商界關係太大，不便提高。記者詢以利率是否有跌落之可駕，答謂：此須視物價之變化而定，物價穩定而利率亦穩定，必需物價下跌，利率始有下降可能。關於本市一般行莊之業務，某氏　爲大部份均穩健，從事黃金投機者極少，目前財部正積極檢查中，外界不宜過多揣　，以免事後有「霄聲大，雨點小」之　。至於今後行莊之檢查工作，手續上將力求簡化，以增效率。</p>

<p>大意謂此次豺政部頒佈之金飾處理辦法，將使全國銀樓業數百萬從業員之生計，無法維持。查金飾買賣，原爲民間之變相儲存，禁止金飾買賣，則一般中下階級之剩餘資金，必轉向國積貨物，引起物價上漲。此次政府以取締金鈔投機之故，使正當安分之銀樓業，遭受覆亡失業之苦，罰非其罪，此其不當者一。政府以七百七十萬元之高價配出，而責令銀樓業照四百八十萬元之價格繳還，在央行爲不當利得，此其不當者二。黃金持有並未禁止，而金飾獨限期收回，有失事理之平，此其不當者三。姚氏讀畢後，由銀樓職工代表張吉生發言。請輿論界賜予援助。</p>
<p>明日晉京請願</p>
<p>聞該業代表將於明日上午十時許，到社會局及市府請願，並定二十六日，聯合各地代表，向中央政府請願。目前通電擁護滬方銀業之主張者，有天津，北平，廣州，漢口，宜昌，成都，南京，西安，濟南，南昌，汕頭，昆明，重慶，柳州，等地之銀樓業，並表示決與滬方一致行動。</p>

<h3>桐油有成交　內銷購買力銳減</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）自外匯　　以後，桐油同業議　爲四十六萬元，昨市已有成交。惟據行商云：桐油價雖已登峯造色，但按之目前漢口市價，每担爲四十萬地，運費需三萬元，　　時間至少爲七天，再加駁卸時間三天，共計所負拆息爲二萬七千元，故來貨價格，幾與滬市現售價格相　，桐油之運銷出口，一時尚難打開僵局。內銷桐油，以價格已與購買力脫節，實銷頓减。</p>

<p>華股昨業外人心雖好，但遭紗花大戶所遏　，高後盤低，午後雖形續低，但乘低補進者大不乏人，籌碼因而見　，最後尚易團上。</p>

<h3>挽救華茶外銷　亟須自謀改善</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據某茶業鉅子稱；我國出口大宗之茶葉，終因國內生產成本高於國外售價，致外銷迄無起色，而吾政府當局對於華茶，業所關懷，除施以貸款等種種善策外，並將對美匯率，自二〇二〇元數度調整至一二〇〇〇元。查國內茶價，雖跟蹤各物扶搖直上，然若十稱茶葉格，目前已能與國外接近，但貨方則仍一味居奇扳持，不忍割愛。最）近英國各地，鑒於華茶採製方面，墨守陳法，出品旣不一致，售價反而奇昂，爲補救急需起見，已紛紛轉求他國，綜觀此種情形，我國茶商如再不自謀挽救之道，外銷恐將瀕於絕境矣。</p>
<h3>祁紅賣戶居奇</h3>
<p>僵持多日之鄭門紅茶，昨日市上依然未見展開。良以英商出口行雖仍與賣戶磋商，惟貨王售意成不放寬，陳中祁門侮担堅售五十萬元，而進購者給價則爲四十四五萬元左右，因此成交與否，尚在願釀中。其他花色，仍以銷往非洲之抽珍·珍届·等綠茶，脫手活躍不衰，行情亦頗穩定。云於各式內銷茶，本街店莊及蘇州帮頻趨注視，惜供求失調，遂呈清閒之象。</p>

<h3>進口貨品價格　最近一致回平　呢絨因缺貨漲起三四成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自本月十六日新外匯率公佈後，我國出口貨品價格漲跌互見。進口貨品價格，則較之高峯時期，一到回平。茲將紙張，染料，橡膠，西藥，呢絨，等價格漲跌情形，分別紀述於後：</p>
<p>紙張　價格因外貨進口困難，國內原料缺乏，金價高漲，與供求關係等，上漲甚烈。本月六日加拿大白報紙侮令六萬五千元，至金價達最高峯時，紙價亦漲至十五萬元一令。新外匯率公佈後，又逐漸回平。前日價格爲每令十一萬。三十八磅道林紙，金價最高時侮令二十四萬，前日回至二十三萬。</p>
<p>染料　價格過去亦漲甚烈。自本月十日至十六日，始終盤旋於最高峯。外匯率公佈後，稍見回跌，六九三確化元本月十六號價格爲八百八十萬元，昨日價格爲八百二十五萬元。五馬硃本月十六號侮十斤五十萬元，昨日價格三十五萬元。三星灰本月十六日每十斤五十八萬，昨日四十萬，一致回跌。</p>
<p>橡膠　價格去年十一月時每磅僅九百元，本年一月漲至至二千元以上。金潮高峯時，竟高漲至侮磅一萬四五千元。新外匯公佈後，乃逐漸回跌，昨日價格爲每磅六千元，較之最高峯時，回跌一倍有餘。</p>
<p>西藥　價格，受美鈔之影響最明顯，美鈔之高峯時期，亦即西藥之高峯時期。本月十六日美貨消發地亞淨每千粒售至二十五萬元，昨日已回至十八萬五千元。拍勒托最高時售至侮　十萬元，昨日每　八萬元。克寗　粉最高時一磅每聽三萬元，昨日二萬五千元。其他如糖　，奎寗·董世維雄等，皆積有回跌·平均計算，一般西藥價格，較之新外匯率公佈前的回跌二成</p>
<p>呢絨　價格，因時〇實銷等關係，批價尼奧起不多。本月十六日與昨日價格相較，的漲起一成半，惟門市價格，質料較佳之呢絨，則因缺貨關係，有漲起三四成者。</p>
<p>此次外匯最高，而進口貨價格反見回跌，其原因蓋在一般貨品車已跟隨美鈔，漲至最高峯，而進口貨品，增牧附加稅之規定，又依照黑市價格結算，故物價狂漲不已。新外匯率公佈後，附加稅辦法取銷，黑市消滅，價格乃一致回小。</p>
<h3>紗市萎靡不振</h3>
<p>紡建代售一千餘件</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市疲莫能興，客帮威以內地價低而觀望，布廠亦以織成品銷滯而無買意，是以各支紗綫續見軟化，人心亦殊不振，第以底價已低，故所跌尚微，略挫一三一萬元而已。</p>
<p>中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡管會售紗，共售一〇三〇件，內廠商六二六件，紗號四〇四件。申請戶數共二九二戶，內廠商一七六戶，紗號一一六戶。</p>
<h3>外商銀行　不得買賣金鈔</h3>
<p>據財部負責人廿四日語記者：（一）外商銀行，不得接受黃金存款，（二）外商銀行，不得作黃金，美鈔之買賣，以上均係根據經濟緊急措施方案所規定者，（三）大戶講存黃金，影響社會利益，亦係　犯刑章。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕監察團金鈔組之調查工作，進行至爲順利，仍在　續調查中。外商銀行及公司，均在被調查之列。</p>
<h3>棉布公會　調查存貨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市棉布商業同業公會，於昨日下午三時，在該公會召開理監事會議。出席該公會全體理監事，及各區區長，由董久峯任主席。討論經過，當決定由各會員布號，將迄二月底止之綿布存量，列表陳報到會。</p>
<p>又昨日綿布後市，因聞須辦理登記，致人心虛怯，行市續超下游。</p>
<h3>羊毛進口限額太少　毛編業請求寬放</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市毛絨職工業同業公會，頃以　管會限額分配當發表本年二月至四月之羊毛，毛條，及毛絨之進口限觀共只美金一百四十萬元。充其量，僅龍講羊毛一百廿萬磅，或毛條九十萬磅，尚不足該　需要量百分之廿，故該業頓感原料短　之恐慌。據悉：該業（國營及外商之毛紡織廠在外）月　毛條七十餘萬磅，年毛五十三萬餘磯。議按現有限觀分配進口原料，則各廠平均侮月僅能開工五日。損失不贊。况現各　所存原腎。機數半月之衞需要，故特於上週六函陳輸管會限籲分配處，呼籲寬放　額云。</p>
<h3>飢餓的世界　國際糧食精兌展望</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯稿</p>
<p>一九四六年份主要糧食的世界供應量雖較上年爲大，可是歡洲和亞洲許多地方，仍不免遭邊一個飢餓的冬天，和更釩餓的春天。</p>
<p>隨着國際糧食管制的廢弛，和世界救濟機構的停滯，各國對糧食的競爭將趨尖銳化。在此情形下糧食勢必流入購買力最强大的地方。美國目前已是一個主要的生產國，不久或將變成進口糧食的一個大主顧。</p>
<p>聯合國當局所担心的是：美國或將拆去國際緊急糧食委負會，所主持的國際糧食管制的支莊。美國拒絕延長聯合國善後救濟總署的壽命，已經明白表示它贊成以各國的單獨行動，而不贊成以國際行動來從事救濟工作。因此聯總在歐洲方面的機構，已於去年十二月底結束，在中國方面將於本年三月底結束，美國旣不參加國際糧食管制，國際緊急糧委會也只好關門了。</p>
<p>美國今後的路綫，決定於自前進口管制的變動情形。出口管制法將於本年六月底取消隨第二期戰時權力法案的滿期，輸入許可制的辦法，將於本年三月底自動結束。國際緊急糧委會秘書長費氏，主張美國的進出口統制應予延長。但是這兩種統制恐拍都不會繼續下去，而且輪入管制法或許不到三月底就要取消。其結果將許可美國進口商搜括脂肪，油類，和其他產量不多的食物，同時因爲美國的購買力較强，在競買時一定戰勝其他需要更殷切的國家。在另一方面，輸出管制的結束，將引起美國消費者，與擁有美元各國，對美國貨劇烈的競爭。總之，美國進出口管制的結束，將使稀有食物的國際分配計劃全盤推翻。（未完）</p>

<h3>共軍在山東　濟南廿一日航訊</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員麗天</p>
<p>在民國廿八年三月至卅一年七月，中共山東軍事，原皆由徐向前統一指揮。卅一年八月，中共正式成立山東軍區，並以羅榮極爲司令負，其下計轄渤海，濱海·膠東·魯中·魯南等五個軍區，而將津浦路以西地區劃入蠶伯戾之管冀魯豫軍區中成爲冀魯　軍區之一部。這時魯共仍沿襲着「七分發展，二分應付，一分抗日」的基本決策，到處襲擎國軍，擴展部隊，至勝利前夕，計已擴展至廿五萬人。日寇投降後，中共爲着爭取受降，擴大解放區，又將原在山東各支隊及地方團隊中之基幹部隊，地方兵團，縣獨立營，聯防大隊，區中隊，村民兵等逐級撥補擴編爲解放師，新編師，警衛旅，獨立旅等正規部隊，將山東軍區亦改爲前綫軍，仍由羅榮桓爲總指揮，分爲五路，擾襲魯省全境。至卅四年十一月，又復將前錢軍易名野戰軍，同時將原在隴海路以南新四軍七個師除第五師外，全部北調入魯，又爲指揮統一計，即以新四軍軍長陳毅兼山東野戰軍司令員，而將羅榮桓及徐向前之一一五師，及渤海軍區楊果夫等所部調往東北。（共的十餘萬人）。稅至本年一月底，中共在山東的軍隊香號據調查如下表：</p>
<p>番號調查</p>
<p>（一）正規師：（新四軍屬三旅九團制）</p>
<p>第一師師長葉飛</p>
<p>第二師師長黨國卿</p>
<p>第三師師長黃克成</p>
<p>第四師師長張愛萍</p>
<p>第六師師長譚震林</p>
<p>第七師師長陳希林</p>
<p>（其中第五師師長李先念部除第十四旅已由豫南回竄皖西外，其餘第十三十五兩旅已西竄陜鄂地區）。</p>
<p>（二解放師：（三團制）</p>
<p>第一師師長何志斌</p>
<p>第二師師長羅榮生</p>
<p>第三師師長曾國華</p>
<p>第四師師長孫繼先</p>
<p>第五師師長聶鳳智</p>
<p>第六師師長劉永</p>
<p>第七師師長宋時輪</p>
<p>第八師師長何以祥</p>
<p>第九師師長錢鈎</p>
<p>第十師師長賀健</p>
<p>第十一師師長着錄</p>
<p>除上以外，尚有：</p>
<p>（三）新編師（三旅九團制）八個</p>
<p>（四）警衛旅（三團制）十個</p>
<p>（五）獨立旅（三團制）四個</p>
<p>（六）縱隊（三旅九團制）七個</p>
<p>（七）民兵部隊（以團爲單位）一一三個（約一百廿萬人）</p>
<p>六個軍區</p>
<p>以上部隊，除民兵外，共爲四十二萬九千四百人，分配在下列六個軍區內：</p>
<p>（一）屬山東野戰軍區司令部陳毅指揮者。</p>
<p>1·膠東軍區（司令員許世友，下設四個軍分區，駐正規軍的五萬人）</p>
<p>2·渤海軍區（司令員袁也烈，下設六個軍分區，駐正規軍的三萬九千四百人）</p>
<p>3·濱海軍區（司令員遲耀東，下設三個軍分區，駐正規軍的七萬人）</p>
<p>4·魯南軍區（司令員張光中，下設四個軍分區，駐正規軍的十萬人）</p>
<p>5·魯中軍區（司令員王建安，下設四個軍分區，駐正規軍的十一萬人）</p>
<p>（二）屬晋冀魯豫野戰軍區劉伯誠指揮者：</p>
<p>6·魯豫軍區（主要籍境爲津浦綫西魯西部份，司令員朱任窮，轄八個軍分區，駐正規軍的六萬人）（晋冀魯豫野戰軍區下另尚轄有太行軍區，冀南軍區等，因不在本文範圍內，未列入。）</p>
<p>傷亡　估計</p>
<p>以上所列魯共正規軍，除膠東渤海爾軍區八萬九千四百人外，其餘三十四萬人，經月餘以來激獻戰鬧，其傷亡據司靠估計，至少當在三分之一以上。觀乎共軍自回竄蘇北鉗攻徐州的企圖失敗，致被迫不得不放棄其華東最大根據地臨沂以後，幾近一週，尚無其他顯著活動，就不難想見其受創之鉅與亟需一相當時間重行整補，重行佈署，俾圖再起，而由遜來旅大烟台間輪帆往來如織及泰安方面且已發現有晋冀察邊區方面調來二三萬人，即可知眞正可以決定山東全局的另一個大會戰正在急劇地醞釀，也即將加速地到來。</p>
<h3>國內金融狂潮沖繫後　香港遊資躍躍保欲試</h3>
<p>— 香港廿一日航訊　本報特的記者子健</p>
<p>國內的金融起了一塲大波動後，站在國門之外的香港，這幾天來，便由「外張內弛」而轉「外弛內張」。換言之，當法幣價值暴跌時，港幣却站着不動，港中居民遙望國內的風波，雖不免「怵目驚心」，但金融界中人，因爲把握不着我政府下一盤棋，大家祗好袖手觀望。及至我最高當局頒佈經濟新方案，港中的局面便由靜而動，其最主要的現象，就是國內大批游資在港中的「躍躍欲試」。</p>
<h3>股票市塲後勁不繼　吸收外滙乏展實業</h3>
<p>國內游資逃來港中，早已喧騰遐邇，但那些游資到了本港，除了產生了三十多所華資新銀行外，還不見有什麼大活動。股票市塲，曾一度欣欣向榮，旋又後勁不繼，國內游資謹愼將事，不敢輕於嘗試。各銀行最大野心，是憑藉國內若十方面的便利，（如郵儲局與經理資委會輸出的鑛產等，）吸收一部份外匯，作未來發展國內實業的準備。牠們在現階段的工作，以保持信用爲急務，所以大家都不敢貿貿然投機牟利，與國內銀行採行的政策迴然不同。</p>
<h3>吸講黑西哥金　形成黃金轉口站</h3>
<p>國內游資有一部分，曾使用於購進墨西哥金，經港轉運內地圖利，牠們活動的結果，香港無形中變成了一個黃金轉口站，以一月份計：輸入值二九·三六四·二九七港元，輸出值二二·八五七，七五八港元。那些輸出的黃金，大半經澳門偷運內地。據消息繼通方面稱：兩三週前，有華中游資四百億元，抵達廣州收購黃金。假如我政府眞的能够有效禁止黃金的買賣，則國內游資在香港經營黃金的作用，便吿消失，（港市金價已由每兩三百零五元跌至二百八十九元），反之，如禁令失效，則香港作爲黃金轉口站的效用。將益見發揮，黃金經港偷運內地，勢將有增無减，（金價一度跌至二百七十二元後即回漲）。</p>
<h3>法幣價値　反黨提高</h3>
<p>由於大波動時，廣州　資大量收購黃金，而政府下令禁止買賣黃金的結果，這幾天來，廣州若干「有金者」，不得不「携」金或外幣來港兌換法幣，以應付籌碼短絀之苦。港中的法幣價值便反常的提高，侮萬元可換港幣五元二角。若照中央銀行掛牌算，則侮萬元應祗值港幣三元三角許而已。這麼一來，本港外貨輸往廣州內地，比前更爲擠擁，我國入超的危機由是愈見嚴重。</p>
<h3>走私貨輸入廣州　粵省民間白銀被搜光</h3>
<p>外貨由港輸入廣州，現在十分之九由走私人物包辦。香港因此亦有華南走私中心的別稱。走私人物，有大股小股之分，佈下完整的運輸網，輸入的是洋貨和黃金，輸出的是若干鑛物（以　佔最大宗）和白銀。這是一個大漏洞，若干寳貴的外匯便經過這個漏洞走脫了。單是白銀一項，據本港出入口署的統計，去年經港輸出的（大部分輸往英國和印度），計有：銀條二〇·五四一·六五二元，銀元一·九八一·五五四元，白銀輔幣八·四四六·五一三元，共達三千萬元（港幣）以上。據說白銀百元運港，可獲十八元之利。廣東民間的白銀，經過走私者大批收購，恐已所餘無幾！</p>
<p>另一個外匯的漏洞就是僑匯。去年年底，貝祖詒的同財部英籍顧問羅傑士來港渡聖誕，聽說就是和港府洽商統制僑匯的問題。僑匯到了香港，轉手又回到美國，因爲商人把牠收購了作爲支付美國貨的貨款。僑匯來港越多，美國貨輸港也越多，（商人有了僑匯，便可擺脫了向港府申請美匯的限制）這對英國實在也沒有什麼裨益。但貝祖詒來港十天，却不得要領而返。去年十二月份，中國銀行經理的僑匯總數爲三·六七八·四八七·四四二元法幣，比十一月份减少一·〇二四·六二二·五七三元，幾及三分之一。本年一月份的數字還未公佈，但照僑匯逃港的情形而論，中國銀行的數字，相信更爲縮少</p>
<h3>房產交易　頓見旺盛</h3>
<p>走私和僑匯的發展，增加了本港的游資，却非游資活動的對象。茲在游資有增無减而亟亟尋求活動對象的當中，本港的地產和房屋事業，最近已成爲一個新目標。尤其是由上海南來的富豪，他們與其付出大筆的「鞋金」去找房子，不如索性自己購買一兩所。月來房屋交易，頓覺旺盛。港中有見及此，計劃拍賣若干公地，其中以匯豐銀行側面，德輔道和皇后道交又的三角地段，最惹人興趣，那三角地段約有一萬方英尺，傳港府呌價每方英尺二百元，現在已有人願出三百元，將來公開競買時，價值也許更大</p>
<h3>部份游資　轉向囤貨</h3>
<p>大量游資集中香港，不特對國內有害，對本港亦無益。現在似有一部份游資轉向囤積貨物的途上，在洋紙和食米方面，已見其端倪。連月本港米價飛漲，上米每斤由八角漲至一元二角。若干薪水階級，呌苦不迭。平息已半年的工潮，最五又見抬頭了！</p>
<h3>古都長安　舊夢難尋　古董業陷入搖落養態</h3>
<p>— 西安十八日航訊　本報特約記者張洲</p>
<p>西安是一個富於歷史風味的城市。從城正中的鐘樓，巍峨的城關，雁塔古寺，碑林勝　……你不由的產生「懷古的幽思」，一舊夢的尋找」。但是在現在，生活困難的現實，已打碎了輝煌的夢境。</p>
<p>除了幾件大的建築物，南院門一帶的古董舖，算是能表現出古色古查。在一兩間門面中，羅列着畫畫文房，古鼎石刻，秦碼漢瓦……。那些帶着泥土石灰與銅綠斑斑的古董，不管它們實質如何？老闆總會隴出大套歷史，幷且引經據典，證明着他的話是非常眞實。他們在語言中，重覆的說着「阿房·未央·隋季·唐代」。……等古代豪華的記載，來加高古董價值。</p>
<p>古覽的種類是很複雜，名目繁多，令人目眩。通常的是陶瓷器·書畫·服裝·彫花傢具·竹刻物·石刻·石塑·泥塑·名碑拓本·舊書·古鏡古錢·軍器……等，以及上古器皿。這些一東西的來源約有三種：（一）在陝甘一帶出土者，的確是古物，但這現在，恐僅佔十之一二，因如係名物，早已售出，除了西安的世家，或有保留外，市面上是幾乎看不見。（二）是假冒物，像本來是明淸時的東西，充作漢·唐遺物，依此類推，尤其是石刻陶資泥塑之類，原件上旣不署年月，又不注作者，以此魚目混珠，非老於此行者，不易識辨。（三）假造的，今天西安的古董，各類都有假的，他們造的也有作到維妙維肖，也有的粗製濫造。但這些製作者，却都把自己的大作，寫上沈石田。惲南田·板橋·仇英……的名字，從道裏你可以看出，商人本色，早已侵入到風雅林中了。</p>
<p>「老長安」的人說，在這裏的名品，多散存於世家門第。三四年前古物展覽會中，曾有不少珍品，如趙子昂的「桃源圖」·「駿馬」·夏圭的一個橫幅也達數丈，而李龍眠的白描僧寺，仇英的人物，倪瓚的山水以及岳飛。文天祥·楊繼盛·董其昌的字，也有不少，但隋唐以前，仍極稀少。據人說：西安大收藏家，幷沒有多少，一般看起來，梁午橋。閽甘園等家中，珍藏之數，當頗可觀。但大部分講來，還是多散存於各處的。</p>
<p>古董市塲的黃金時代，近數十年來，當在民初幾年，大量的向東南上海一帶走，至後民二十年左右，尚稱不衰。雙「一二」事變之後，即稍不如前，及「七七」後沿海各地相繼陷落，新的時代需要着新的東西，因此在連天烽火當中也就比較的大非夕比。到卅四年，美國兵至西安後，這商塲又活躍起來。那些外國人，對長安古城的一切，都感到新奇，對這些古董，大量的收買，冷落了的市塲又活躍起來了。它和「古衣」業同樣的被外入埀靑，但是自盟軍東去之後，也就冷落下來。</p>
<p>在物價狂漲之下，商人們已多感到不易維持，西安的糧價，猶使人頭痛，在兩個月之內，竟漲至三倍左右，到目前止，黃金雖然因禁止買賣，而無（私）行無市，但麵粉竟由四萬七千而至五萬八千元（袋計）。而百貨在半月之內，也提高百分之八十以上，這樣一來，生活負祖予了任何人由公務員到商人都感到了很太的恐慌，古董商人在現今，不用說也更多「大非昔比」之感了。</p>

<p>剝奪看報自由怪劇</p>
<p>編輯先生；請注意為某種搗亂勢力所裏脅着的份子，侵入到我們學校裏，來干涉我們的讀報自由了下凡是站在國家興建和秩序安定立塲的報紙，他們都認爲不配口味，對於看報的人，大施漫駡與妨礙並出以干涉，他們簡直剝奪看報的自由。我們的學校裏曾有某社因張貼某報而被他們攻擊，並要自治會干涉，阻止貼張，並說要貼報的話，限貼某報或某報，否則請自治會公佈貼報人的姓名。</p>
<p>他們過去也曾喊過「民主」「自由」的口號，可是竟不給別人以「自由」。而企圖以少數人荒謬的主張，抹煞大衆的公意，這件事類似所謂「解放區」裏的自由與民主，我痛恨這樣的「自由」與「民主」，並了解他們所倡的黨派退出學校的眞意。現在我們學校裏，正忙着這種活動而弄得情形非常混亂了，他們主張是要學生無心向學，妄作政治犧牲，請敎育局注意肅淸！（李宜初）</p>

<h3>山深　瀑　谷遂　沫飛　展望　福建水力</h3>
<p>— 福州十五日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>生產少閩少苦</p>
<p>生產建設需要大量之資金，嶄新的技術，豐富的資源，廉價的勞力及便利的交通等是。福建的經濟建設向來礎於省財政之困難，交通之阻梗及工業原料的缺乏以致未有很大的成就。論生產技術，尚停滯在中古式生產的階段，墨守舊法·如福建的茶葉，糖，紙的製造，戰前馳銷於南洋及歐美，惜朱能在生產技術上予以改良，否則必能在國際市壩上佔得優勢。福建經濟生產力之脆弱，另有一基本原因在，即是福建是一個缺煤的省份。缺乏動力工業，馬達如何能够發動呢？福建省地方經濟就是在缺少電力之下窒息了，福建全省一千三百餘萬人民也就在缺少動力工業之下貧窮了。</p>
<p>以福州而言：福州全市電廠發電僅有三千五百克羅瓦特，其燃料乃用木材，不經濟而至於此。且持此三千五百克羅瓦特之電力不特不足以供應福州一些輕型工廠的需要，即福州全市民用電燈的電力仍然只能在白天不供電的原則下勉爲維持，福州而外，福建全省只有厦門，漳州，泉州，南平，建甌，古田，永安，沙縣等縣市有小型發電廠，以微弱的電力供給市民。福建人民爲了生活水準的提高多麼渴望有一天全境達到電氣化的境地，以廉價的電力作各種生產的動力。</p>
<p>用瀑布　發水電</p>
<p>利用自然，是人類的聽明處。旣然福建缺煤，那末，利用懸岩陡落之水流以發電是最經濟的辦法。根據閩省建設應調查：計有安溪縣之晋江流域，可發十萬匹馬力，華安縣之九龍江流域，可發相當水力尚在詳細勘察中，古田縣以龍亭瀑布爲主的古田溪水力可得八萬匹馬力，仙遊縣九鯉湖的可發一萬匹馬力，綜計上列四處可得卅萬匹以上之馬力，若得全部開發以供給全省各縣民用電力之需要及供應本省今後經濟發展及供東南各省之用，允綽有餘裕。</p>
<p>仙遊九鯉湖所發之電力可供閩南沿海各縣之食鹽電解工廠，製冰廠，製糖廠，罐頭廠，水菓鮮菜冷藏廠，水漿廠之用途。能亭所發之電力除供給古田附近木漿廠，鋸板廠使用外，尚可輸送大量之電力到福州市區及其附近，以供給福州附近各工廠之用電，預計各工廠動力增强後，生產力當可倍增。</p>
<p>古田溪之水力開發最有價值，茲詳述之：</p>
<p>古田溪　建水壩</p>
<p>古田溪使用溪蘊藏水力至巨，力至巨，其上遊東西支流，源出屏南縣境，蜿蜓五十餘里，至古田縣城東匯流，水勢漸大，城南二公里之龜瀨有古田電力公司引水壩橫截流域，故水流平衍，龜瀨以下灘瀕櫛比，岩石畢露於山谷間，廻行十一公里至曹洋村納曹洋西溪，水流至此，河床略趨平坦，兩岸山勢峻峭，南流三公里，是爲著名的龍亭瀑布，懸岩陟落，的十三公尺，懸瀑飛沫，蔚成奇觀。瀑布以下，河床愈狹，水石相擊，傾瀉而下，流十公里，達李家崎，餘勢始盡而下，再八公里，至博坪，水流平穩，又五公里於水口匯入閩江，全溪灘瀨瀑布集中於龜瀨至李家崎之一段，溪長廿四公里，落差達二百卅餘公尺，是爲古田溪開發水力之優良地址。</p>
<p>古田溪逼近福州，有全程凡一三五公里白福古公可通，閩江水運至谷口及水口均可與古田聯接，交通條件至爲有利。</p>
<p>全工程分三級</p>
<p>經省那家設　派員會同資源委同資源委員會水力發電工程總處派來間之徐，林兩工程師實地勘察結果，認爲古田溪之水力發電限於目前的條件及閩東的需電量計，可分期開發，全部工程分三級進行：</p>
<p>第一級：利用龜潮至半坑亭間彎曲河這之落差，築壩於龜瀨原有電廠塲址以下一公里處，該處兩岸山勢甚陟，河身較窄，岩石畢露，爲良好壩址。但需要壩身較高（的十五公尺）在此一公里之間，尚有可能築壩地址，但在左岸係冲積田地，河床爲亂石，恐不易獲得堅實之壩址，河之右岸，　隧洞穿越塔山達奉陪亭之山谷，長的一·五公里，利用山谷築壩作前池設廠於山谷出口處或以明渠引水越此山谷至半坑亭以下二百公尺處設廠，可得水頭達一百公尺。二者須待地形測量後決定之。</p>
<p>第二級：利用龍亭至闇林村一段之落差五〇公尺。曹洋村以下至龍亭兩岸山勢峻峭，河岸窄狹，均爲良好之壩址。擬築增於龍亭瀑布以上，可縮短引水渠道，依山開渠，長二公里餘，至闇林村設廠業電，該處地勢平坦，宜於設廠，並利用曹洋兩溪流域面積約二〇〇平方公里，於半坑亭下公里匯入古田溪，其出口處之一段山谷深邃，有瀑布數處，聽泉亭處瀑布落差的十五公尺，若於其上築　，引水至溪口發電，可得水頭八〇公尺，其上游田原廣闊約有八平方公里，可用以薪水，以增第二第三級之流量。</p>
<p>第三級：利用嚴頭亭至李家崎河床灣道落差八〇公尺，於巖頭亭築壩，以隧洞穿越山脊，然後依山開渠一·五公里，至李家崎設廠發電。</p>
<p>以上三級工程，均極簡易，可得電力八萬餘四·分期開發，輕而易舉。</p>
<p>五機關　合力辦</p>
<p>經省建設應及資委會會同派會會同派員分赴各水力發電地點實地勘察後，將就古田溪一帶先行開發，惟該溪水文資料，尚鮮確實而詳盡之紀錄，應於古田縣設立永久之水文站，繼續紀綠水位並測量流量，他如雨量，蒸發量均須預作有系統之觀測，以備隨時校正，以爲將來施工之張本。至於實施是項工程計劃，則由福建省政府，資源委員會，台灣電力公司，華僑與業公司，福建經建公司等五機關合辦，組織福建電力公司籌備委員會，負責工程之進行。台灣電力公司以其在台省東海岸因電力過剩而停辦之電廠之水力發電機及其發電配件折價投資福建電力公司，其他土木設備部分則由華僑興業公司，福建經建公司及福建省政府會同分擔，賢源委員會則擔任拔術設計工作。</p>
<p>此項水力發電工程，在資源委員會就拔術方面，台灣電力公司就機械設備方面，華僑公司就賢金方面的協力下，當會很快的分期完成。</p>
<p>福建最感缺乏的是鐵路交通與動力工業，有了鐵路可使福建特產暢銷各地，不至使旣有的工業窒息；有了動力工業，可以剌激福建新工業的振興，兩者對福建地方經濟的開發具有決定性的作用。閩贛鐵路已由閩人陳體榮等在滬發起組織「福建鐵路公司」，向加拿大若干廠商洽貸巨款，由行政院担保，預計加方器材一到，即可决第興建。福建電力有限股份公司希望能早日完成一段水丈工程，給福建人民振奮，福建民風純樸，苦幹，一般人民生活皆甚刻苦，省政當局應如何努力繪咄一幅壯麗的遠景，以吿慰於終年胼手胝足的人民呵！</p>

<h3>膠濟路上　還鄕忙</h3>
<p>— 青島廿日航訊　厚石</p>
<p>山東的大動脈膠濟鐵路，在路工搶修之下，在接軌後不久，幾次三番，又被共軍破壞。出事地點在南泉藍村之間，另外一處是膠東車站附近，破壞路軌二十餘節，鐵橋六孔，以致車行又吿擱淺，路局現正派車搶修中。</p>
<p>淸晨六時未到，車站就擠滿了乘客，他們都是離鄉背井，流亡靑市好久了一旦聽親膠濟路通車，都想早日歸鄉。候車室裏人　嘈雜，擠得幾無插足餘地。</p>
<p>路局爲了招待記者訪問團，特別掛了一節公事車。機車的前面，黨國旗交叉，臨風飄揚，象徵着車廂裏面人們喜悅的心情。七時四十分，車慢慢地開動，向西而去。車到第一個大站的大港，因爲無票乘車的人太多，秩序棄亂，不得已又開回靑島。憲兵和路警上車，重新查票一次，將沒有票的旅客勸說一番，請他們下車。這樣一來，車中秩序比較好一點，但車行的時刻，卻被延遲了一小時餘。</p>
<p>車行的速度很快，過膠縣沒有停車，一直駛到高密。高密在魯東一帶，地居重要，由此可以連接魯南與魯北。車站本來是一座宏偉的大建築，現在却被毀壞了，水塔只留着殘痕。矚目四望，只是些斷　殘垣，景象十分荒凉　車過太堡莊，這正是日前舉行接軌典禮的地點，速度變得很慢，車廂也搖擺得很厲害。這個地點，因爲是膠濟全綫一個灣曲的地方，地勢突出，所以路軌被破壞得最烈，修復也很不容易。</p>
<p>到坊子的時候，天色已晚，車就在這裏停了一夜。坊子情形很好，因爲共軍始終沒有來過。次日一早，車繼續開往離縣。羅縣是膠濟路上一個大站，僅次於靑島與濟南，有十二萬人口。魯省出口的猪鬃及髮綱，大半都是由離縣裝運出去的。因爲路運不通的原故，維縣的商業亦形蕭條，人民生活貧苦，稍有資產的人們，都往靑市或外埠去了。現在鐵路已通，想以後陸續回鄉的人必多。</p>
<p>交通的恢復，不但貨運暢通，在鬆疏人口，解救屋荒各方面，都有其影響。比如靑島的人口，據警局的發表數字，十一月份中外人口統計，共十五萬二千七百七十七戶。人數七十五萬二千二百五十八口，外籍人口計一千七百五十三口。近因交通比前便利一些，回鄉者日見增多，因之較上月减少一百一十一戶，人數减少三千八百三十口，外籍人口亦减少二十三口。目前膠濟路旣通車，回鄉的人必日漸增加，那麼靑市的人口或將還要减少，自然這還得看時局的推移如何而定。</p>

<h3>保險</h3>
<p>— 法·日爾韋司作　李青厓譯</p>
<p>走出了監獄的門，拉伏不免吃了一驚，因為他舊日的老板慮冀雅兒正立在他的對面，這虛冀雅兒就是從前教他坐了十八個月監獄的人。</p>
<p>「早安，拉伏。」這個人乾脆地說。「您大概沒有在這裏等着罷，嗯？……我早知道他們今日早上放您出來、我已經得了報告。」</p>
<p>「您找我幹甚麼？」拉伏不快活地問。</p>
<p>「我來向您提議一件事，」盧冀雅兒說，「您可願意圖到我的店裏去嗎？」</p>
<p>這個彼開釋了的人聳起了雙肩。</p>
<p>「蜀犬吠日到驚的店裏去！」他說</p>
<p>「對啦，您從前鬧了些兒岔子，幹了些兒……不正常的事，但是任何罪過都是可以受饒恕的！……並且我希望那種接着落到了您身上的事兒，將來可以給你做教訓，所以現在我們不用再談了。倘若您願意照着從前同樣的待遇回到店裏再辦原來的事，那末　只須下星期一在照例的鐘點到店裏來就行，我可以等候您。」</p>
<p>拉伏想了一會兒，隨即決定了主意：</p>
<p>「照辦！」他說，「星期一再見！」</p>
<p>關於監獄對精神的影響，確然有許多話待乎說明，不過誰也不能否認有人在那面取得了某種屬於尊戲性的感覺。所以拉伏不免會感到親見自己減低身價，倘若他竟向這個無情的老板表示了極少的感謝念頭，以前，這老板為着一些兒不幸的細微出人，不　他種種央求和眼淚，竟把他送到了法庭。所以現在接受了他的要求，已經是叢得講交情了。</p>
<p>「我本沒有選擇之權，」地用自恕的口吻向自己說。「因為仗着現在我可以提出的參考資料，是不會這樣容易找到一個會計兼司出納的位置的。」</p>
<p>此外，他決定斷不寬恕任何傷人的隱語，任何轉變方向的言詞，無論這些東西日後來自虛冀雅兒方面，或者來自日後重新會面的舊同事方面。不過這一些人都他富於臨機應變之才和小心護愼之態的。他們都用同情態度接待他，沒有表現一點兒極小的驚訝，如同拉伏之回到店裹來，是世上最自然的事。至於老板呢。他的趣味也高，並不流露那種屬放自居有功者的令人難堪的驕態</p>
<p>「早安，拉伏，」他簡單地說，「您知道　應當辦的事，我不必關照您，可不是嗎？倘若您對於那些在您離職期間之中經過的一切，需要甚麼說明，那末請您乾脆地問我就得啦。」</p>
<p>拉伏世故地謝了他，接着就動手工作。他聚精會神幹起來，因為所有賬簿的格式都是很被人忽略了的。</p>
<p>「曾經請過三位會計先生代替　，却沒有一位能義幹退下。」那個伺候辦公室的老工人沃克達甫向他告訴。「他們從前都說是一個人要辦這些事實在太多，所以要求一個助理，不過老板從沒有答應他們，您當然想得明白！……「您的上手從前一個人辦得伏伏貼點，」老板這樣回答了他們。」</p>
<p>後來他又不忠實地加上這一句：</p>
<p>「無疑地為着這樣，他又請了您來！」</p>
<p>這用說嗎！對啦，拉伏一個人辦得伏伏貼貼，不過為着這樣辦，他却自有一種至上的理由：在旁人謹慎地假造那份受了托付的簿記的時候，那末與其背上厭着一個敏於發現陰私之感的同事，無密嚴正地幹起來，因此，一們不忠實的會計，是常常比一個疋直無私的職員格外肯做苦工的。同樣，他通常格外留心老板的利益，他的生意興隆在他　來是重要的，因為一個人只能在很充滿的　子衷隨意挪動銀錢。遇着作弊的人在法庭之前交出賬簿的時候，這都是一些應當被人明白報告的事情！那末只有向着法官們夫說明這個了！</p>
<p>現在，眼見得這些壓在肩頭上的工作，拉伏却不埋怨甚麼。因為重新尋着了他種種習慣，他的桌子，他的椅子，他的各種簿子，以及辦公室裏一切曾經和他相處那樣長久的零星附屬物件：譬如墨水瓶，吸墨紙墊子，日期戳子，潤濕手指頭兒的海棉，素來乾涸的膠水瓶子之類，他覺得自己是快活的啦！</p>
<p>不遇那件教他認為像是最快活的事，却是他在這店裏所享受的安寗。原來開始坐在他舊有的位子上的時候，他曾經害怕的生活從此落在一種帶嫌疑意味的難堪氣壓之中，壓在一位因為過去記憶變成不加信任的老板的不往察看之下。在變成了可疑的人的時候，拉伏是不能久抱一種這樣委屈的姿態的。但是這類的事一點也沒有發生。盧冀雅兒待遇他道個屬員正確地和以前一樣。他從不覆核他的賬目，從不總是在言詞裏流露點兒懷疑。像從前一般，他把保險箱的鑰匙交給他，並且聽憑他羅警娜些數目動輒可觀的存款。這樣多的信任終於感　了拉伏的心。</p>
<p>「這眞他是一個漂亮角色，我從來沒有想到他有這樣的勁兒！」他在他的老板的時候便這樣自言自語。</p>
<p>他因此用了雙倍的公正勤勞來表明自己的知己之感，拚命補償那些彼代理職務的同事們造成了的延誤。有時候，他看見自己被甚麼意外的困難所阻擱了。在那本總賬本上，許多新戶頭是當他離職的時候開的，結果造成了許多小的謎語，使得拉伏竟想獨自弄個明白而絕不去詢問任何一個人。</p>
<p>這些新花樣裏頭的一個，特別弄迷了他。這筆　是列在總務費裏的，數目是三千佛郎，戶頭是這樣奇怪的稱謂：「補償社」。道這補償社可以是甚麼東西呢？這個掛着奇怪招牌的行家，能轂收三千彿郎的代價，賣了些甚麼東西給盧冀雅兒商店呢？……當然本有一個很簡單的方法去知道底細：去詢問盧冀雅兒先生本人，不過拉伏的自尊心起了作用，他認為這個課題是一件私人事惰，所以說到找個人來帮助他，他認為這竟是承認自身能力不　。所以他決定在不要受人輔佐的條件之下去找答案了。他接連花了十多次功夫去夫閱各種送貨單，各種提貨單，各種收據，一切使他走上路綫的可疑證件。然而枉然！儀管用盡了一切的追究，而補償社的神秘依舊沒有發現一點兒</p>
<p>這時候，盧冀雅兒像是專心於一步勝似一步樣地去說實拉伏從他跟前取得的好評。從沒有一個老板肯這樣寬大地信任他的會計兼司出納的誠實。拉伏因此大為感動了。</p>
<p>「設我以前能　把竊盜行為加於一個這樣的人！」他心裏想着。</p>
<p>但是他還沒有走到他的感激涕零的盡頭。</p>
<p>「我要走開幾天，」某一個早上盧冀雅兒向他說，「這裏是幾張空白支票，您將來可以按照需要的大小和遲早，塡上數目到銀行裏去取錢。」</p>
<p>面對着這個關於信用的新證據，拉伏已經覺得自己的眼淚　到了眼眶兒裏面來，這時候，那老板接着又說道：</p>
<p>「您應該付補償社司的費用，收據應議在這幾天就會送來。」</p>
<p>拉夫抓着了機會，他問道：「我正想問　，這個補償社究竟是甚麼？」</p>
<p>「怎樣！您不知道！」盧冀瞧兒呌喚起來。「這是保險公司。」</p>
<p>「那末，您不在互助社保險啦？」這個在驚訝之中的會計道：</p>
<p>於是，　冀雅兒簡單地說道：「誰說，不過互助社只「做」火險，這是不叢的……您可明白，我還保了竊盜險，現在。</p>
<p>驚心動魄地受窘了，拉伏當天傍晚就離開了這家有人用了一種好情感來騙他的商店。這依然又是許多被一個在　獄裏的強硬訓練之下訓練出來的人所不能忍受的事兒之一。</p>
<p>青厓按：日爾軍司（B.Geryaise)是現代的法國作家，其身世一時尙待查考。他的作品除此寫外，最近尚見到一個名為「漂毫面具」的短篇，其文字清麗與此篇同，其富於心理分析與此篇同，其注重結構而於篇末揭出「未知點」以振起讀者興趣亦與此篇同：可以說他的作風和「海樣沈寂（LeSilenced　de　ner）」的作者韋爾歌（Vercors）的甚為相近。大概這是此次大戰以後法國小說和短篇小說的一種新傾向罷。本篇原文見本年二月九日法文「中國郵傳週刊」，當係從巴黎刊物中轉載者。二月十五日在北極閣下譯完記。</p>
<h3>評霞西園書畫</h3>
<p>— 果園</p>
<p>書畫中如人物，如載魚，皆世人所喜為，面不易雜至極之境。靈西園有薛稷人物，李伯時三元圓，仇十州廣六如所繪，均雍容華貴，非近畫家所能夢見。其萬魚一項，如顧虎頭義鴿　，宋徽宗白屬，皆極出色之作。以魚一項而論，王廣之魚，顏延之之魚，李伯時之魚，各出新奇，不落尋常窠臼。細細審　，無不神氣奴生，嗔精品也。願與有識之士共賞之！</p>

<h3>世界名畫展</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>西洋繪畫自明代利瑪靈輸入我國後，曾與中國畫以不少的刺繳。惟當時全係示教關係，繪畫不過是宗教的附屬品，所以當時我國畫界，除肖像畫稍受影響外，其他畫法並未受有影響，直至清初義大利畫家郎世寗至中國後，中國畫界始掀起了較大的波瀾，終以西洋畫法與中國畫法有許多格格不相容的地方，郎世寗雖然不惜犧牲純粹的西法，俯就中法，浩成一種折衷畫派，究以過於工細繁複，不合中國風流灌酒的口味，是以其傳不廣。</p>
<p>清末民初，棄禁大開，西洋畫也隨之而東渡，於是西洋畫風起雲湧，頗有喧賓奪主，取中國畫地位而代之的氣象。終以民情風俗及種種環境關係，物質條件，最初不可一世的西畫，二十年來乃作蝸牛式乏進行。及至今日，以生活高漲，西畫材料不易購置，西畫更面臨一相當嚴重的危機。如何可以打破這種難關，使西畫在中國不致因營養不良而枯萎下去，實為頗費躊躇的事。</p>
<p>由於我國博物院美術館的缺乏，國人對放西畫沒有欣賞觀摩的機會。又以印刷簡陋，出版貧乏，環顧國中，很少關於介紹西畫的著作，使有志研究的人，無從着手。而大多數曾留學歐美的畫家，也因環境和生活的關係，紛紛改行，益使西畫界黯然無色</p>
<p>現在上海美專因為助學的關係假青年會舉行世界名畫展覽會，會中所列四畫全係國外印刷之原色畫片，僅次賃蹟一等，而且依照畫史的次第，自原始洞穴繪畫，一直到目前的野獸派未來派，每一時代，每一大作家，都有一幅以上的代表傑作，使觀者不但可以看見真正的西洋畫的全般面貌，而且可當作一本畫史讀，對於西畫的演進，可以說是一目瞭然，使看畫的恍然如置身羅馬，翡冷翠，盧夫爾，等處的大畫廊中，豈非一大書事！</p>
<p>同時除了西畫以外，尙有國畫也是按照時代，自五代宋元以至現代，每一大作家，也都有傑作陳列，此次因以西畫為主，國畫為副，所以國畫方面不免遜色</p>
<p>像這樣的展覽會，以我所知，在我國還是創舉，所以不但喜整西畫的人應該去看看，就是不畫國畫，不畫西畫的人，為了開開眼界，也應該去看看，才曉得繪畫世界的莊嚴偉大，不致坐井觀開，夜郎自大。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血183</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>第三個步驟，乃實施心靈刺探術。這一步動作，雖說是一種無辦法的辦法，但因「八」的秘密，似乎關係甚大，不能不冒險一試。為了希望把效果弄得更有把握一些。糧羣和w羣也自動參加。所採用的，乃遞增催眠。這與原來的計劃，略有不同；其泆仍舊利用鶴見作媒介，以耀羣作第一主催，w君第二主催，我則照應善後。鷄見曾與萍子有過兩次心靈的互通，照原理講，這二次實騐，應當沒有意外的危險。</p>
<p>以上三步工作完成，餘下還有一個半步。這個半步，即是續羣所發動的，上東交民巷去探險。我本來主張把這一步挪到第二天自畫或夜晚再說，無奈總羣這位東北小姐，性情相當燥烈，說到一涉，就要做到一步。況且旁邊還有那位小老虎，從來就沒有畏縮這回事，我們認為這一着相當冒險，他却當作遊戲一般。經我們再三相勸，這才答應，僅僅哨探一園，決不交手；所以只算半個步驟。</p>
<p>——步驟計劃妥當，已是七點敲過了。匆匆晚膳之後，各人分頭料理應有的準備和佈置。鶴見和我剛把幾通秘電擬就，發送完畢，「〇四」己經赶了回來。他的報告，呌我們十分失望。</p>
<p>原來在他出城的時候，郊外的戰爭已成尾聲；宋司令的主力，雖說保全了十之五六，向南面良鄉涿州一帶撤退；兩位大將，轅登禹和佟麟閣將軍的陣亡消息，却已經證實。兩人的部下，和張自忠將軍的一部分部下實力，被日軍逐設用鉗夾陣勢，消耗得所賸無幾。陷在北平城內的我方駐軍，衝小城外，又被擊回；從來幸虧城外的殘軍，拚死的築成了一道兩道，內外呼應，這才把城內的大部人馬救出，向西落荒而走。</p>
<p>「〇四」探尋吳鼎元的踪跡，據沿路的寇軍說，除了中國兵士以外，就沒有看見過一個老百姓。吳鼎元當然無法飛到長辛店去，照理「〇四」可以不必多此一行。但命令是命令，絲毫還犯不得，況且大戰已完，沿路搶聲已稀，所以五點多鐘，已行抵長辛店。在那裏穿去穿來，碰見的都是些日軍，和些不三不四的浪人混混。六點多鐘，重又踅回城內。</p>
<p>他看見時間還早，恰又被他打聽到日軍拘禁了許多中國人，分開三四起看管着，他隨即要求同去的幾個日本特務，到這幾個圈禁的所在，尋覓一下；結果，始終找不到吳工程師的影子。所聽到的，還有兩條不妙的噩耗；一，日本飛機，大事轟炸津郊，南開大學為轟炸最大目標，聽說按舍已經夷成平地。二，天津雖說有李文田將軍，率領部下，誓死拒敵，然津市的命運，己經危在旦夕。並且，另據松部密化，大隊日本兵艦，裝載幾團陸戰隊，已向我津沽海口駛來，晚十二點以從，即可在大沽登陸。</p>
<p>鶴見聽了「〇四」這些報告，覺得津平局勢，轉變之速，出於意料之外，因恐我們預定的突擊，要受阻碍，立刻傳今備車，又呌我把這些消息，轉告w君。臨走，還像老太婆一樣，瑣瑣碎碎，再三叮　我，轉告大家，無論時間如何晚，甚至晚到影響我們的計劃，也必須候他本人圖來，再發動一切預期的行勸。這時，他的理色，竟有些倉　了。</p>

<h3>華盛頓誕辰　宴舞會別記</h3>
<p>— 馮蕊</p>
<p>二月廿二日的黃昏時份。</p>
<p>亞爾培路辣斐德路上，繁星點點，晚來風急。</p>
<p>顯然與往日情景有些不同，一向冷清清的路上，那天顯得格外熱鬧起來。這裏引用一句李後主的「車如流水罵似龍」的詞來，眞可當之無愧。</p>
<p>八百位高貴的衣冠楚楚的中美仕女，陸陸續續的給逸圍吞了進去。</p>
<p>在中美友情上說：這是一個不平凡的日子，那天正是華盛頓的誕辰日，上海留美同學會等中美四團體，為此舉行了一個盛大的宴舞會。</p>
<p>司徒大使在宴舞會上，作了十五分鐘的演講，沉着中肯的語氣，引起全場熱烈的黨聲。當他指出中國的唯一敵人，是貧窮，文盲，疾病，假公濟私的時候，全場屏氣凝神的，似乎可以從每一個人的內心裏，聽得低喟嘆息的聲音。</p>
<p>這裏：每一個人都現得年輕了幾十年，他們盡精的歡呼，盡興的狂舞，青春與歡樂，據有了每一個人的心胸。</p>
<p>太太小姐們，都卸去了輕裘，換上了最時式的新裝：長裙曳地，舞衣燦嫻，袒胸露臂的領略着溫柔。音樂與春天。雖然這時候，室外猶是春寒料峭，重裘不耐寒的時節；但是這一塊園地中，那是春意盎然，舞興正濃，已路越了另一個天地，蹁躚於無牽掛無憂虛，另一個樂園裏了。</p>
<p>當然的，這天的情形，不同一個普通的集會，樂曲也瘋狂亢進得異乎尋常。那幾個樂師，吹吹打打的，都漲紅了臉，以各種熱烈的音符，吹奏得使人忘記時間，忘記了世界。</p>
<p>吳市長一向亦是一個跳舞的嗜好者，不過，那天晚上，却因為陪伴着司徒大使的緣故，始終沒有下塲去。僅僅向來往擁擠的跳舞人羣中，對一些熟悉的賓客點頭微笑吧了。或者是坐得太久了的緣故，開始打起呵欠來，有人說：「市長的舞癮發了」。市長夫人似乎要比從前胖了一些，坐在司從大使和美總領台維斯的中間，格外陪襯比－個典型的東方美來。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳博士，亦以「留美」身份，出席那天晚上的盛會。穿着一套灰色的西裝，曾經和司徒犬使用北平話親切的談了二分鐘</p>
<p>如果我們不知道梅籣芳是一個名伶的話，這將近六十歲的人物，誰能相信却還能在舞台上專門扮演小女子的妞妮嫻娜之姿呢</p>
<p>梅蘭芳善用莊重的姿態，和細膩體貼的動作，照呼着每一個女伴，似乎很容易令人想起：這多少還帶着些舞台上的色彩來？</p>
<p>舞會進行時，在那個偌大的舞池中，終因為容受不了經常一二百對的舞伴，顯得擁擠不堪。一對一對的舞伴都有寸步難移之感。舞池的頂上，高高的掛着三大串汽球，成了大家視綫的集中點。</p>
<p>汽球開始向下飄的時候，哄動了整個的舞池：大家希望搶着幾個汽球，小姐們輕聲的笑，輕聲的喊，矯捷多姿地伸手去撩，她底舞伴們，為她呼喊出鼓勵的呼聲。那一陣子紊亂，嘻笑，雜夾着汽球的爆裂聲，形戒了一幅「仕女戲球」的畫面來。樂台上的黑人，笑得僅僅露出二排雪白的牙齒，在霓虹燈下，一閃一閃的發着光。</p>
<p>最後，大家再來一陣碰杯，各道晚安，重新踏上了春夜多寒的夜上海的馬路。一連串的汽車，逐漸地載着他們的主人，回到春天甜產的夢鄉去。</p>
<p>那時候，已是十二時多了，亞爾培路上，滿天星光，依然燦爛。迎面一陣清風，令人感覺到在凉如水。</p>
<p>（二月二十三日追記於尊聞</p>
<h3>愛打聽的人</h3>
<p>— 氣樓主人</p>
<p>愛打聽是一種美德，因為它是好奇心的表現。然而這種美德發展到對人而且十分積極的時候，那就要令人「吃不消」了。我就是一個受到愛打聽的極大麻煩的人。因為我不善辭令，無法逃避打聽，我尤其不喜歡打聽別人的事，所以根本沒有反攻的力量，於是碰到愛打聽的人，就祗有被打聽的份兒。</p>
<p>愛打聽的人是隨時隨地要打聽你的。背後探聽的事不必去管了，且說一碰見你，他就能運用技巧，問你一個月賺多少錢，你怎樣在養活你的一家數口之類，如果你有一個皮包，他能一邊說一聲「看看不要緊？」一邊就打開來看。如果你拿一本書，他要拿過去看看是什麼書。如果你書中夾着一張紙，那更是非看不可。如果書中有一封信，他一定要知道這是誰寫來的，或者是寄給誰的，你的上衣口袋上露出一些什麼的，他會伸手去拔出來看個明白。</p>
<p>在閒談的時候，他要打聽打聽你的經歷，如果你無法關閉打聽之門，他的鼻子就一直要刺到你過去的深處；你是不是什麼黨徒，你右沒有坐過牢，你是不是一個漢奸等等。你的家世當然也逃不過他的查問。你的祖土是幹什麼的，是不是一個嘉三·你的母親是不是一個姨太太，你是不是一個私生子，然後再調查你的老婆。</p>
<p>他如果光臨你的辦公室，或者你的住屋，私家偵探也不會像他這樣東翻西檢。總之你如果有什麼秘密的話，保你結果己完全在他的掌握之中了。然後他才肯心滿意足地離開你。</p>
<h3>報張縮篇的管見</h3>
<p>— 曉鄰</p>
<p>上月份，中宣部限定各地報張篇幅以米，本市各大報紙都相繼縮小了篇輻，原來出三大張以外的，改成了三大張，三大張的改出了兩張半，兩張半的也依照類推改出了兩大張。自然，中樞的原意是希望減少紙張入口而節省外匯，在報館方面因為原料的飛漲，也樂得遵行，可是這一來，却引起了不良的後果。</p>
<p>首先受影響的是報紙的銷路，就我所知道的，有不少的報紙在最近降低了銷數（也許有部分報紙能維特原狀）當然本月份報紙的漲價是原因之一，但最大的原因，還是一般讀者對於內容感到不滿足的緣故，因為縮小篇輻的各報紙，並沒有能一如初衷（？）的在廣告方面縮小，而所割捨的，却是智識階級所需求的副刊以及各欄的專載，於是無形之中，讀者對於報紙的興趣，不免打了一個七折八折。</p>
<p>其次，賣文為活的作者，也受到相當打擊，由於出版界的冷落，他們發表文章的地鐵，已是小得可憐，他們僅有銷售文稿的市傷，可算就是幾張報紙的副刊和專載攔，如今這類的篇幅一裁減，無異在奪去他們的飯確；雖然，這些不關報紙的本身；可是，文人的苦痛也就是中國文化前途的悲哀。</p>
<p>還有，因受內亂的影響，勝利一二年來的文化事業，正和其他工商業一樣地遭遇危機，出版業在沒落，書報館在倒閉；同樣的，定期雜志在收縮，單行本的售價　昂，無一處不拋露文化界的慘狀。在這精神食糧大荒　兩年代表，報紙竟形成民眾最可　的要求，也是最切要的讀物，如果報紙的篇輻再減縮，報紙的內容再貧乏，那便是文化厄運更慘淡的前奏。</p>
<p>看看紐約時報的銷數，實足警人，然則何以它能每日銷售到三百萬分以上？主要的還不是由於它的篇幅和內容！（紐約時報日出五十九大張，內包括雜誌十入　，評論三張，其他論壇九張。）當然，以我們的財力，物力，交通工具民眾民準，絕難望其項背的；但，這不妨做我們的參考：為了增進報紙的本身業務，為了援救文化從業人員，為了負起報紙的正確任務，假如本市各報不能縮小廣告面積的話，還是宜乎恢復原來的篇幅。（在三大張以內）。再贅一句，假如「成本攸關」，「力不從願」的話，最好不必在副刊和各種專載的篇幅上減削。</p>
<h3>依隨</h3>
<p>— 寧頤佐</p>
<h3>滑波</h3>
<p>— 謝軍</p>
<p>「滑波」是歐美一種新興的運動，歷史很短，僅在十五年之前，有幾位法國滑雪家，忽然想到穿了木製的雪橋形的滑雪鞋，到水面滑溜，試試他們新奇的念頭，結果是創始了這種驚駭，刺激，迅捷如風的運動。這種運動，需要有勇氣，精　泳，這還強健的體魄：你想插着在時速六十八英哩飛馳中汽艇的拖　，脚踏着　　，在波浪市破出　浪，二侧浪濺如雪，你沒有具僅上述幾點，你敢書試嗎？但是這種運動能產生高度的刺激，在驚心動魄的飛滑中，你覺得有飄飄欲仙的快感，好如一只　鷗掠越水面。</p>
<p>這種運動沒有廣泛的發展，因為受着置辦高價器具的經濟條件的限制，一個「滑渡」的愛好者，必需備有一副十八厘米寬，二公尺長的滑橇（價格三十餘美元），二十多公尺的　繩，需要一只起碼有三十二英里時速的快捷汽艇，因此就在金元國也只有一萬人左右，能　　這　高貴的　動。</p>
<h3>長春樹</h3>
<p>— 孫佩華</p>
<p>這是根據蓓蒂斯密絲的小說改編而成的一部好戲，原著在美國是最銷書之一，就整個演出上說，銀幕上的「長春樹」雖不一定比原著更好，但也決不致辱沒了蓓蒂小姐的小說那是可以斷定的。</p>
<p>就一般的好萊塢影片面論，「長春樹」之應予較高評價，不僅在於演出技術上的成就，我們應該說：它更或多或少地提示了；在這個不合理的社會中，靈魂或者說是精神上的富有，實較任何其他東西為可貴。</p>
<p>像凱蒂那　的女人，我們日常接觸得太多了，應該說她本性也是善良的，但是悲慘的生活使她們肉體與精神都給　折得如此可怕，但這又豈是她自己的所願。不過終於她有所恍悟：人與人之間的溫暖該是多麼的可貴！</p>
<p>全片自始至終都洋溶溢這種溫情主義者的　息，這裏凱蒂的冷酷任性，與她女兒的體貼熱情適巧是一種極顯明的對照。劇作者（改編者）把這兩個絕然相反的力量像電流一樣，通到喬納這共同的對象上去，從喬納的感應上引起各種各樣的感情上的火花來，這是極聽敏而且成功了的做法。</p>
<p>導演伊里亞克山是値得在這種稱道的，因為他把全劇的氣氛處理得那麼好，至手法簡潔，猶其餘事，（如介紹貧民窟只用二三個鏡頭等）。演員方面，演茀倫茜的小女孩潘琪安茄納，是－個了不起的童星，雖說角色本身易於討好，但她那糧深湛的心理表演眞是太難得了。他如演匪倫夫婦的詹姆斯鄧與桃樂賽麥瑰亦都在水凖之上。</p>
<p>如果說「長春樹也有缺點的話，那末便是它過份強調了所謂「溫情主義」，而不曾深入地從溫情主義後面揭露出社會現」實的眞相來，讓一切現實生活的悲慘痛　，除了都給掩蓋在「溫情」還拖着一條渺渺茫茫的尾巴，說是：樹校雖彼鋸去了，但它仍將生出新的綠芽來，這新的綠芽也就是新的希望。</p>

<h3>Chairman Arrives in Jinan by Special Plane; Nationalist Troops in Southern Shandong Recover Teng County; Advancing on Zou County in a Converging Attack</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by over twenty staff members, arrived in Jinan by special plane from Nanjing at around 4 PM on the 24th. Commander Wang and Chief of Staff Luo, along with other senior staff, personally welcomed him at the airfield. The people here, upon hearing the news, felt even more secure and invigorated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The Nationalist troops under Hu Lian, advancing north from Lincheng and Zaozhuang, entered Teng County at 5 PM on the 24th. They are currently coordinating with the Nationalist troops in Yanzhou in a converging attack, continuing their advance toward Zou County. The Jinpu Railway Bureau has begun repairing the 180-li stretch of railway between Lincheng and Yanzhou, and it is expected that the southern section of the Jinpu Railway will be open for traffic from Pukou to Yanzhou by the end of April.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] The war in central Shandong is intensifying. The remnants of the Communist forces under Chen Yi have amassed a force of 100,000, launching fierce attacks on Laiwu and Boshan in multiple directions in recent days, attempting to capture Boshan and Hanchuan with a force more than four times larger, and then encircle Jinan, in order to cover up their crushing defeats in southern and western Shandong. Due to the disparity in numbers, the Nationalist troops have taken the initiative to shorten their defensive lines, making comprehensive and advantageous deployments. According to military sources, the situation is expected to change within two or three days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The Nationalist troops on the Jinpu Railway front recovered Teng County at 10 AM on the 4th. The gateway to southern Shandong has been opened, and the Communist forces in the area will no longer have any strategically important strongholds to rely on for resistance.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Jinan has once again fallen into the tense situation of around June of last year. All entertainment venues have been ordered to temporarily suspend business, and the curfew has been moved from 11 PM to 8 PM. It is rumored that Liu Bocheng has advanced to the vicinity of Changqing, attempting to join Chen Yi in attacking Jinan. The people of the city are calm and composed, continuing their work as usual, and are confident that under the leadership of Commander Wang, they will be able to turn danger into safety and crush this desperate struggle of the Communist forces.</p>
<p>Nationalist Troops in Tusikou, Laiwu, Complete Mission and Evacuate</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] The Nationalist troops in Tusikou, Laiwu, in central Shandong, having completed their mission, began breaking through on the 23rd to relocate to advantageous areas, and are still engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist forces along the way as of the 24th. More than 20,000 Communist troops north of the Jiaoji Railway began moving south from Taotangkou on the evening of the 23rd, attacking Changshan and Zouping, attacking Zhangqiu from Qidong, and attacking Zhangdian Station from Huange and Suozhen. Fierce fighting is still ongoing as of the 24th. 20,000 Communist troops in eastern Shandong attacked Shahe from Linan River and Huibu from Liutanbu and Sunzheng in two directions, and have been in fierce fighting for six days and nights without stopping. On the evening of the 23rd, Communist troops attacked Nianhe, Yancheng, Dangaizhuang, and Zhonggongzhen on the outskirts of Jinan in multiple directions, and on the morning of the 24th, they attacked Changqing. All of these attacks were of a disruptive nature and have been repelled by the Nationalist troops. The battlefield in Shandong Province is expanding, and the Communist forces clearly have designs on Jinan. The Nationalist troops have made strong new deployments and there is no cause for concern. Jinan has been under curfew from 8 PM since the 24th, and pedestrians are being checked to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Nationalist troops withdrew from Boshan and Zichuan on the evening of the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] The war situation in central Shandong has improved. The Communist forces attacking the railway and the Zibo township area have been forced to adopt a hard-fighting tactic that is absolutely unfavorable to them due to the strong resistance of the Nationalist troops. After only three days and nights of desperate fighting, they have suffered more than 25,000 casualties and are now showing signs of exhaustion and are on the verge of collapse. News this morning indicates that most of the two brigades of Communist forces attacking Tusikou have been wiped out, and the Nationalist troops have captured more than 20 Communist regimental and battalion commanders, instructors, etc. from the Fourth Column and the Second Police Brigade east of Boshan.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] A certain Nationalist army division reinforcing central Shandong has entered the positions south of Boshan with a rapid march of 130 li per day, and the situation on that line is becoming more stable. In addition, the Communist forces who had been harassing Jinling town and Mashang station east of Zhangdian on the Jiaoji Railway were routed by the Nationalist troops last night.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] After two days and nights of fierce fighting in Boshan, Heishan in the south of the city and Xihe in the east of the city were broken into by the Communist forces by dawn on the 24th, and fierce fighting is now taking place on the outskirts of Boshan. It is also learned that the Nationalist troops in Boshan retreated on the morning of the 24th, and the situation in Zhangdian is unclear.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] The battlefield in central Shandong is expanding, and the focus of the war has shifted from Laiwu to Zibo and the outskirts of Jinan. The battle situation in Boshan on the 24th was more intense than on the 23rd. At the same time, the Communist forces in Zichuan, Zhangdian, Yidu, Zouping, and Changshan also launched extensive attacks, and the fighting was also fierce. In the northwest of Jinan, the cities of Qihe, 20 kilometers away, Changji, 18 kilometers away, Dangaizhuang, 18 kilometers to the south, and Zhonggongzhen, 20 kilometers to the southeast, all saw fighting from the evening of the 23rd to the 24th. The Jiao-Ji Railway train journey was shortened to Mingshui on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] The Nationalist troops defending Laiwu fought fiercely with seven or eighty thousand superior Communist troops for four days and nights, killing or wounding more than half of the Communist forces. Due to difficulties in supplying, in order to preserve their strength, General Li Xianzhou led them in four groups to retreat to advantageous areas and continue fighting with the Communist forces. On the same night, the Nationalist troops in Tusikou north of the city also abandoned their positions.</p>
<p>Nationalist Troops Officially Enter Yuncheng, Pursuing the Enemy Towards the Southern Bank of the Yellow River</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] The vanguard of the Nationalist troops in western Shandong entered Yuncheng on the 22nd. Due to the too-fast advance speed and the many roads destroyed by the Communist forces, transportation was inconvenient. On the 23rd, they voluntarily moved to the south of the city. After the Nationalist troops reinforcements arrived, they officially recovered Yuncheng at 10 AM on the 24th, and continued to pursue the retreating Communist forces towards the southern bank of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] A clash occurred in Wenzu Town, south of Zhangqiu and north of Mingshui, on the morning of the 24th, and fierce fighting continued until the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] The pacification work in Linyi, Yixian, Xiangcheng, Lanling, and Yutai, Juye, Jiaxiang in southern Shandong has been actively launched. Refugees are being distributed 20 to 30 catties of flour and cornmeal along the Jinpu and Longhai railway lines and are happily returning to their hometowns. However, the recovered areas in southern Shandong have been destroyed by the Communist forces for a long time, and there is a severe shortage of food, and relief is urgently needed.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces Harassing Dehui and Jiutai Areas, Cut into Several Sections; Nong'an County Government and Railway Personnel Make Strategic Retreat</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 24th] The 80,000 Communist forces are expanding their military operations in the Changji triangle area with increasing intensity. Fighting broke out in Kaoshantun, 20 li east of Jiutai, yesterday morning. Communist cavalry units were dispatched to Huadian and Liugou, 45 li northeast. The main force of the Communist forces is concentrated between Dadafangshen and Chengganjie in Jiutai East, Dehui, attempting to disrupt the Changji traffic, occupy Jiutai, and capture Dehui, an important stronghold on the Zhongwei road, and even claiming that they will attempt to enter Changji.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 24th] Chengzijie, a strategic point about 80 li east of Dehui and north of Jiutai, has been surrounded by superior Communist forces since the 23rd, with extremely fierce artillery fire. Aerial reconnaissance on the 23rd revealed that most of two columns of the Communist forces were advancing south north of Chengzijie.

This method will be implemented in major cities. In remote areas, the simplified tax collection procedures will still be followed. The Ministry of Finance is now recruiting special tax revenue personnel, establishing account checking training classes, and training existing personnel for distribution to various places. Due to the large number of industrial and commercial institutions in the Shanghai area, there are not enough personnel to be allocated, so it is necessary to borrow technical personnel from the Central Bank to work.</p>

It is an important document for future Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation. The report was submitted to the governments of both countries by Chinese and American members for review. Due to its broad content and many relationships, it has not been publicly released for national reference until now. It is now known that the governments of China and the United States have agreed to release the report publicly on the 24th of this month. As for the preliminary implementation plan based on various suggestions, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is studying it in coordination with relevant agencies. The summary of the group's report is as follows:</p>
<p>China's agricultural construction plan is deeply related to the prosperity of the entire country, and it must be appropriately coordinated and continuously improved to be effective. The clothing, food, housing, and transportation needs of the Chinese people largely depend on agricultural products. Therefore, anything that affects agriculture will affect the lives of more than 75% of the farmers, and also the happiness of every person in the country. The group firmly believes that a perfect agricultural plan will bring about tangible improvements in the material and spiritual life of farmers, and will also greatly help in the fundamental resolution of China's domestic problems.</p>
<p>Agriculture and industry are as dependent on each other as rotating wheels. If they are not planned and purchased together and advance equally, neither can develop to a high degree. The largest consumers of Chinese industrial products are farmers, and the size of farmers' consumption depends entirely on the strength of their purchasing power, that is, whether their economy is affluent. Therefore, the improvement of agriculture must go hand in hand with the development of industry, so that industrial products can have a broad market. Moreover, the development of industry requires the import of some machinery from foreign countries, which requires foreign exchange. Before the war, China's agricultural product exports accounted for 70% of the total exports. Therefore, agricultural products are the main source of foreign exchange. Therefore, anything that can promote the production, processing, and transportation of agricultural products for export will help the construction of industry and increase the welfare of the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The group firmly believes that the above-mentioned improvements can be seen in reality. According to field observations, if China can apply the latest scientific methods, such as improving crops, soil, livestock, and agricultural tools, it can greatly increase agricultural production. Improvements in agricultural loans, transportation, and marketing can increase farmers' income, and the poverty of rural society can be reduced.</p>
<p>Content of the Suggestions</p>
<p>The group deeply feels the difficulties of the current environment for farmers. To solve this problem, there must be a perfect plan, coupled with a reasonable and sound organization, to make the following suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Special attention should be paid to the construction of chemical fertilizer factories, the development of farmland water conservancy, the improvement of crop and livestock varieties and the prevention and control of their diseases and insect pests, the construction and increased production of fuelwood forests, and the production of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat. (2) Emergency measures should be taken to adjust foreign exchange rates, reduce agricultural loan interest rates and transportation costs, encourage the production and export of agricultural products such as tung oil, silk, tea, and wool, and resume the operation of relevant industrial stoppages. (3) Efforts should be made to supply low-interest agricultural goods in large quantities, improve the tenant system in certain areas, implement land surveying, registration, and valuation, and enforce the land tax issues and land laws promulgated by the central government in 1946. (4) Standards, grading, inspection, quarantine, and market control of agricultural products for export and domestic sale should be implemented. (5) National education related to agriculture and forestry welfare, including public health, protection, transportation, dredging rivers, and flood prevention, should be actively promoted. (6) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Education should cooperate closely and strive to realize the connection between agricultural colleges and agricultural experiment fields in each district. The existing Agricultural Extension Committee should be reorganized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry into the Central Agricultural Extension Bureau, and extension agencies should be established in provinces, counties, and districts. (7) Nine districts should be set up across the country. Each district should select a central location and establish an agricultural college, an agricultural experiment field, an agricultural extension office, and an agricultural library to be responsible for coordinating the agricultural education, research, and extension work of each province in the district. The proposed district center locations are Nanjing, Beiping, Changchun, Lanzhou, Wugong, Chengdu, Wuchang, Guangzhou, and Taipei. (8) The Central Agricultural Control Bureau should be established within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and sixteen branch bureaus should be established throughout the country. (9) The existing Farmers Bank of China and the Central Cooperative Bank should be merged to form a National Agricultural Bank to supply various agricultural financial needs. (10) The Ministry of Social Affairs should discuss appropriate measures to prevent rapid population growth with government force.</p>
<p>The completion of the above suggestions cannot be achieved overnight. The group believes that the development of various agencies must be determined by the urgency based on whether suitable talents can be recruited. In order to cultivate such talents, it is proposed to send promising staff members abroad for advanced studies.</p>
<p>In order to implement the above suggestions, agricultural construction funds must be greatly increased. Considering the close relationship between Chinese agriculture and the welfare of the people of the whole country, the group firmly believes that the increase in such large amounts of funds is not excessive.</p>
<p>The group hopes that some of the undertakings in the above suggestions can be the beginning of future Sino-American agricultural cooperation.</p>

<h3>People's Organizations to Implement a Slow and Steady Approach; The Ministry of Social Affairs Plans to Submit for Approval by the Highest Authority; The Content is Divided into Two Parts; Professional Organizations Adopt a Licensing System</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Ministry of Social Affairs has recently drafted the organizational principles of people's organizations and submitted them for approval by the highest authority. The content is divided into two parts. A registration and licensing method is adopted for professional organizations because professional organizations participate in elections and may be transformed into candidates for public office, so they must still be subject to control. Non-professional organizations adopt a filing system and are not subject to any restrictions. Organizations that are established submit a filing request. After this principle is decided, the Ministry will proceed with drafting the People's Organizations Law. Other laws and regulations that violate the above spirit will also be revised or repealed. As for the distribution ratio of representatives of professional organizations in agriculture, industry, and commerce, a conclusion has been reached after multiple discussions. The ratio of each province and city will be decided according to the population size, and the provinces and cities will then distribute it to agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations according to the population ratio of agriculture, industry, and commerce in the province and city. In addition, representatives of free professional organizations will be produced by the central government. In order to encourage experts and scholars to participate in politics, the distribution ratio between them and agriculture, industry, and commerce will be increased.</p>

<h3>Philippine Reply to Our First Note Delivered to the Embassy; The Conclusion States That It Is Prepared to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 24th] A spokesman for our embassy stated today that Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino has replied to the note presented by our Minister Chen Zhiping on the 18th regarding our government's decision to suspend negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship. The reply was delivered to our embassy on the evening of the 22nd, but at that time the office hours had passed and our embassy officials had already left the office. The spokesman of our embassy declined to release the content of the reply and was unwilling to predict whether negotiations would resume. However, the Central News Agency reporter recently learned from reliable sources that Quirino only reiterated the position he explained to the press on the 21st in his reply, and also refuted the accusations made by our Minister Chen that the Philippine negotiators did not have a consistent and unified policy, and that the non-governmental sector had taken discriminatory actions against Chinese businessmen here during the negotiations. It is reported that the Philippine Foreign Minister acknowledged in his reply that eight of the nine proposed clauses in the draft had been agreed upon by both parties, but said that "before the treaty is formally approved by the governments of both countries," all parts of the draft are subject to change. In describing the course of negotiations in his reply, Mr. Quirino concluded that the Philippine government is prepared to continue negotiations, with the aim of reaching an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties and that reflects "the traditional friendly relations that have always existed between the peoples of China and the Philippines."</p>
<h3>Suzhou Postal Workers' Union Suggests Salary Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 24th] All employees of the Suzhou Postal Workers' Union recently issued an urgent appeal under their joint names regarding the provision in the emergency economic measures plan promulgated by the central government that restricts the calculation of workers' wages to the highest standard of the cost of living index in January. They believe that this will not only affect the lives of workers but also cause labor-management disputes, and they specifically requested the Legislative Yuan to change it to calculating and paying based on the local cost of living index at that time when reviewing the plan.</p>
<h3>Police Department Formulates Measures for Handling Vehicle Accidents</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The General Police Department of the Ministry of Interior Affairs has decided to reduce the difficulties in the execution of traffic police because the number of motor vehicles in various cities is increasing day by day, and traffic accidents are emerging one after another, and traffic police often cause disputes when handling them due to the lack of definite standards. It specially convened relevant units to discuss improvements and formulated a "Notes on Handling Vehicle Accidents" to inform all levels of police agencies to strictly follow.</p>
<h3>The Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan: Said to be Established with Eleven Members</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] According to the Constitution, the Judicial Yuan shall establish ten Grand Justices who shall be in charge of the interpretation of the Constitution and laws. They shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan. It is heard that according to the draft of the new Judicial Yuan Organization Law, the Yuan will establish eleven Grand Justices, whose duties and qualifications are specifically limited to various matters stipulated in the Constitution, which is slightly different from other countries. As to whether the President of the Judicial Yuan may participate in the meetings of the Grand Justices, opinions vary. Opponents believe that if the President can participate, it may give rise to suspicions of administrative interference, so it seems better not to participate.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-Implementation of Price Deliberation</h3>
<p>The "Implementation Measures for Price Deliberation," formulated according to the four principles of stabilizing prices in the "Economic Emergency Measures Program," has been passed by the Supreme National Defense Council and sent to the government for implementation. This method is the procedural law for the government to stabilize prices, and the method of stabilizing prices is to adopt a deliberation policy, which is analyzed as a policy of "assessing" and "negotiating prices." This policy was used during the Anti-Japanese War, but it failed due to the lack of scientific technology in theory. The "Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation in Extraordinary Times," promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on February 20, 1939, also represent the full picture of the wartime price deliberation policy. The content and spirit of the "Implementation Measures for Price Deliberation" proposed by the Executive Yuan this time are somewhat the same as the wartime measures; however, they are not completely the same, and there are many things to be discussed about their implementation in today's situation. Therefore, based on what we have seen, we offer the following criticisms:</p>
<p>(1) Deliberation Organization: According to the provisions of the implementation measures, a price deliberation committee shall be organized in places where it is necessary to deliberate prices. It shall be organized by the director of the competent bureau (referring to the Social Bureau), as well as representatives from the Senate, the Chamber of Commerce, the Labor Union, the Industry and Commerce Association, and the Public Security Bureau, forming a committee of seven to eleven people. Their main responsibility is to set the selling prices of essential daily necessities for the people and assist in reporting behaviors that violate the negotiated prices. This constitutes the highest authority for controlling prices at the local level. However, the spirit of the price negotiation policy should be fairness and impartiality; this should be the case for producers, and even more so for consumers. The Chamber of Commerce and the Industry and Commerce Association represent the producers, while the government and the Public Security Bureau represent the authorities; only the Labor Union represents the consumers, the hardworking masses. If the price negotiation is to be fair and impartial, it should be based on taking into account the interests of both producers and consumers. The original "Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation in Extraordinary Times" paid considerable attention to this, so the future price evaluation committee should add more representatives from people's organizations to represent the majority of consumers, the hardworking masses, to speak on their behalf, so that fairness can be achieved.</p>
<p>(2) Evaluation Standards: According to the provisions of the implementation measures, the items subject to price negotiation shall be based on essential daily necessities for the people, excluding table salt, and the profit margin shall be added to the cost of the goods, according to the usual practices of various industries in the local area. The prices are subject to re-negotiation when the cost of goods changes drastically. There are several points to note about this price negotiation standard: (1) The prices to be assessed and negotiated are limited to essential daily necessities for the people. How are the prices of other goods to be controlled and stabilized? It seems like freezing the prices of essential daily necessities without freezing others; (2) The assessment method is based on cost, not on market prices. In theory, it is a cost evaluation. However, cost lacks a uniform law. The production cost of the same commodity varies depending on the production relationship; producers have different interest rates, freight charges, management fees, and depreciation depending on the organization and operation; among these subtle and complex factors, how will the price evaluation committee find a solution? If the price of a certain item is assessed based on the item with a high cost, the result protects small businesses but also benefits large businesses. If the standard is based on the item with a low cost, the result is that it protects large businesses while harming small businesses. There are also many accounting problems; how can we bear to recall the painful experiences of price deliberation in the rear during the past? (3) According to the "Economic Emergency Measures Program," the price index should be frozen at the level of January of this year. Undoubtedly, this should be used as the standard during deliberation, but the implementation measures also acknowledge that re-negotiation is possible when the cost changes drastically, as if acknowledging that there are factors that cause prices to rise. If this is the case, the price deliberation committee still cannot freeze prices; it must keep an eye on this unbridled wild horse at all times.</p>
<p>(3) Penalties: According to the provisions of the implementation measures, those who violate the approved negotiated prices may be punished in accordance with the "Regulations for Punishing Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices." According to this regulation, it was promulgated and implemented by the National Government on February 15, 1945, and its legislative basis is the provisions of Article 8 of the "National General Mobilization Law," so it can also be said to be a subsidiary law of the General Mobilization Law. As is well known, the "National General Mobilization Law" is an emergency law, a mandatory law, during wartime, which greatly restricts the rights and freedoms of the people. Now that the war against Japan has been won and the situation has changed, among the forty-eight laws and regulations that the Supreme National Defense Council passed to amend and abolish last year, the "National General Mobilization Law" and the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Obstruction of National General Mobilization" were also repealed; in legal terms, when the mother law is repealed, the subsidiary law should also lose its effectiveness. This time, the "Implementation Measures for Price Deliberation" again authorize local governments to revive the "Regulations for Punishing Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices." This is a flaw in legislative technique, and it is also a pity that the implementation measures contain excessive urgency and were not submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedure. Regarding this point, if the administrative authorities do not provide relief and amend the "Regulations for Punishing Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices," or resubmit them for legislative approval, there may be suspicions of arbitrary action. If this step is lacking, those who are punished in the future can file an appeal according to law.</p>
<p>The above is only a criticism of a few important items in the implementation measures. There are still many technical problems that may occur during the implementation of the evaluation; how to use them reasonably depends on the administrative capacity of the local government. Otherwise, the so-called stabilizing prices and deliberating prices, when implemented by incompetent administrators, will inevitably lead to the failed path of "stopping boiling water with soup, and saving a fire with firewood."</p>
<h3>After Kawashima Yoshiko was Escorted to Nanjing: Detained in a War Criminal Detention Center; Will Be Returned to Beiping after Testifying</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The news that the female spy Kawashima Yoshiko (Jin Bihui) was escorted to Nanjing from Beiping has aroused great interest in all circles, but the authorities have always kept it secret. Kawashima was flown directly to the capital from Beiping on the morning of the 22nd. After arriving in Nanjing, she was escorted to the Ministry of National Defense, and at 2:00 PM on the same day, she was transferred to the Xiaoying War Criminal Detention Center, where she was detained in cell number 8. Reporters visited the center on the 24th, but were politely refused by the person in charge. They could only look at Kawashima's appearance from a distance through the window bars. At that time, Jin Bihui was sunbathing in the square with other war criminals. She was wearing a blue cloth cheongsam, had short hair, and wore cloth shoes. Her complexion was ruddy and her attitude was relaxed. At times, the sunlight filled the ground, and the outdoor temperature was quite high. After being exposed to the sun for a long time, she retreated to the shelter under the eaves, seemingly unwilling to be tanned. It is said that her treatment in prison is the same as other war criminals. One female war criminal, a Taiwanese named Chen, lives next to her. Jin Bihui once asked the detention center to allow the two of them to share a room, but this was not approved. She speaks fluent Beiping dialect when talking to the management staff of the detention center, and speaks fluent Japanese when talking to other war criminals. It is said that she is 33 years old this year and is still complacent about what she has done in the past, and has no intention of repenting. As for Jin Bihui's escort to Nanjing, she was summoned to the war crimes military tribunal to testify for Lieutenant General Takahashi, the former chief of staff of the Japanese North China Garrison Army. After Takahashi's trial is over, she will be returned to Beiping, where she has already been sentenced to life imprisonment for treason.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai's Wife: Second Petition for Retrial Rejected by the Court</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the Supreme Court rejected Zhou Fohai's appeal on the 27th of last month, his wife, Yang Shuhui, filed a second petition for retrial with the High Court in accordance with the provisions of Article 28, Item 2 of the Special Criminal Procedure Law. It is now known that the Supreme Court authorities believe that the reasons cited by Zhou for the retrial are insufficient and have been refuted by the Ministry of National Defense and decided by a collegial panel of three judges. Therefore, there is no need for a retrial. The decision was rejected again, and the ruling was delivered to the High Court at 5:00 PM on the 24th. According to the special criminal case regulations, the defendant can only petition for a retrial twice.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications National Highway Network Plan: All Important Highways Directly Managed by the Central Government; Total Mileage Approximately 45,000 Kilometers</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] In order to develop post-war highway construction and consolidate national defense, the Ministry of Communications has revised the National Highway Network Plan, which includes all highways connecting the capital, provincial capitals, economic centers, and international routes within the scope of the national highway network, under the direct management of the central government, with a total mileage of approximately 45,000 kilometers. The Ministry plans to transfer the national highways initially taken over from the provincial governments to the highway management bureaus in various districts under the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications for management. All construction, maintenance, and improvement work will still be temporarily managed by the provinces. Other traffic management and transportation levies on the national highways will be handled by the highway management bureaus in various districts under the Highway Administration. The above plan has now been submitted to the government for approval.</p>
<h3>Highway Administration Allocates Funds: To Repair Highways in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 24th] Zhejiang Province's highways are well-known in the country, but they were severely damaged during the Anti-Japanese War, making recovery difficult. Although national mandatory labor has been used to actively repair earthworks, there is no way to repair bridges and road surfaces. Pi Yingchang, Director of the Department of Construction, made a special trip to Nanjing to discuss this matter. It is now known that the Highway Administration has agreed to allocate 10 billion to repair the highways, with an initial allocation of 2 billion. In addition, the Executive Yuan has been requested to allocate steel bridge frames worth 3 billion. Therefore, the restoration of Zhejiang Province's highways is now promising.</p>
<h3>National Identification Card: Exempt from Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 24th] National identification cards are being actively processed in various places, and there are questions about whether or not stamp tax should be affixed. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has telegraphed all counties to inform them that national identification cards are an essential element of household administration, and stamp tax should be waived uniformly to facilitate universal implementation.</p>
<h3>Results of the Previous Higher Examination: Scheduled for Release on July 7th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] All the exam papers from the previous higher examination have been graded. The Examination Committee will meet on the morning of the 25th to decide on the number of candidates to be admitted, and the results will be released on the 27th. They will be available in newspapers on the 28th. In addition, since 1931, a total of 116,363 people have passed various examinations.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Instructs Wuxian County: To Restrict the Establishment of Private Middle Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 24th] The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education believes that the number of middle schools in Suzhou is sufficient compared to the population ratio. Recently, it telegraphed the county government to instruct it to restrict the establishment of private middle schools.

<p>[Our Wuxi Correspondent] County Magistrate Xu Chaoruo, in view of the vulgar customs of the people in this county, holds welcoming gods and temple fairs every spring, which not only wastes manpower and money, but also easily allows local ruffians and hooligans to mingle among them, extorting and blackmailing in the name of temple fairs to enrich their own pockets, affecting local security, should be strictly eliminated.

<h3>More Than 200 Shrews in Wuchang: Create Havoc at the Xujiapeng Wharf</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 24th] The Xujiapeng Wharf workers'械门case, which has repeatedly turned into a full-scale brawl, has not been fully resolved despite repeated mediation by various agencies and unified organization. Yesterday morning, the workers under Huang Quanlin insisted on not being controlled by the Railway Bureau and privately negotiated freight transportation with various transfer companies, forcibly carrying out loading and unloading. They also hired more than 200 shrews, each carrying filthy objects, shouting and scolding along the wharf, while refusing workers from Wang and Wang to work at the station, causing temporary chaos. The military police felt unable to manage the situation, and it was not until 3:00 PM that they were dispersed under suppression. The competent authorities are now consulting on a thorough solution.</p>
<h3>Prisoners Escape from Quzhou Prison: Twelve Escapees</h3>
<p>[Our Quzhou Correspondent] Inmates at the Quzhou County Local Court detention center, since the promulgation of the amnesty decree, those with relatively minor crimes who met the amnesty conditions have been released successively. Those who have not been released are mostly thieves and serious criminals. Because the amnesty decree and sentence reduction methods have been delayed, they have long been uneasy. After dinner on the morning of the 16th, they were released into the cage for recreation as usual. The prisoners took the opportunity to rush to the factory and the kitchen, grabbing knives, wooden sticks, and clubs to carry out a riot. At that time, Director Zhang led the guards to suppress them, but because the defense force was weak, they were beaten and injured. Then they broke through the back door and fled in droves. The military police arrived after hearing the news, intercepting and encircling thirteen escapees. Twelve people, including Xu Zhaoni, escaped. The prison has reported to the Pacification Headquarters and police and military agencies for assistance in the arrest.</p>

<h3>Four-Power Military Government Formulates Laws: Dissolves the Prussian Federation: To Prevent the Revival of Nazi Militarism: Submits Report to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference Next Month</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin 23rd] The four Allied military commanders in Germany today drafted a law formally dissolving the Prussian Federation, the historical birthplace of German militarism. This law will not need to be submitted to the Allied Control Council of the four-power German occupying military government for final approval. The four-power military commanders proceeded with their meeting as usual on the 23rd of this month and reached an agreement that the four-power report on the elimination of Nazism and militarism, which had been in dispute for a long time, would be submitted to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The content of the report has not yet been revealed, but it is understood that the four powers may express satisfaction with it. Previously, the Soviet Union refused to hand over any information on living Nazis, leading to a week-long stalemate. The Soviet Union also objected to the "dissolution of the Prussian Federation" not being decided by the Control Council, but allowed it to be submitted to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference for handling.</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation Between the British and American Zones: Supported by the Four German States</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin 23rd] Lieutenant General Clay, the new military governor of the US military in Germany, said today that the economic merger of the British and American zones has been guaranteed by the four German states in the US occupation zone, expressing full support and cooperation. Clay's statement was made after the administrative chiefs of Bavaria, Hesse, and Württemberg-Baden, and the mayor of Bremen, held consultations. Clay and officials from his military government discussed the relationship between the governments of the various states and the economic institutions of the two newly merged zones. It is said that "this discussion was extremely satisfactory because it has clarified the relationship between the two parties. As a result, we have obtained guarantees from the four states within the US occupation zone that they will unanimously support the economic integrity and cooperation that we advocate."</p>
<h3>French Deputy Prime Minister Clarifies: Outline of the Plan for Germany: The Ruhr Industrial Zone Under International Management: The Saar Implements Economic Merger with France</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Toulon, 23rd] French Deputy Prime Minister and Communist leader Thorez gave a speech to the crowd in Freedom Square in the city center today, criticizing the Allied countries for reducing the amount of coal sent from the Ruhr area to France, disregarding France's needs, and prioritizing the revival of Germany. Thorez also elaborated on a plan for solving the German problem, which will be submitted by France to the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, with the following five key points: (1) Immediately and completely eliminate Nazism in Germany and elsewhere; (2) Immediately disarm Germany; (3) Destroy Germany's war industry and strictly control its heavy industry; (4) Internationalize the Ruhr area; (5) The Saar area to implement economic merger with France. Thorez said, "The entire future of France has been invaded by Germany three times in 75 years. We French people, as well as people of shame all over the world, must understand that we should take measures to protect our country against aggression is absolutely necessary. Regarding the internationalization of the Ruhr area, the area has been a pan-Germanist war arsenal, so it should be managed by international institutions and work exclusively for the reconstruction of countries that have been invaded by Germany. Our right to security and our claim for reparations are one and the same. Of course, we do not admit that we want to revive Germany and not our own country. The internationalization of the Ruhr area can enable France to obtain a supply of coal. As for the Saar area, France has always demanded economic merger with the area, but we do not want to violate the will of the people of the Saar area and annex the area. What we are asking for is justice. We have never mistaken the entire German people for Hitler, but the German people must acknowledge their responsibility for causing losses to other countries."</p>
<p>Reasons for the Delay in the Anglo-French Alliance</p>
<p>Lies in France's alliance system, we hope to add an Anglo-French alliance to the Anglo-Soviet alliance. The Anglo-French alliance has been delayed because the main reason is that Britain misunderstood our interests in the German issue. Understanding must be established between the great powers, and it is also indispensable for ensuring a solid and lasting peace.</p>
<h3>Turkey Attaches Importance: To the Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Has Achieved Success</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Ankara, 23rd] The Turkish Broadcasting Station recently issued a message stating that Turkey is eagerly awaiting the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Allied countries still have many major issues to resolve, because not only the fate of Europe, but also the fate of the entire world, depends on the decisions to be taken by the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 23rd] Preparations for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference are progressing smoothly. The four foreign ministers' representatives on German and Austrian issues will formally adopt the reports to be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on Monday and Tuesday. There are still two main issues regarding the Austrian issue that have not been agreed upon, namely the definition of borders and Austrian capital. The four powers also have differing opinions regarding the preparation process of the German peace treaty and the extent to which small countries participate. According to general indications, although the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference is limited to discussing German and Austrian issues, diplomatic activities to amend and subscribe to alliance agreements may also be inevitable, such as the signing of the Anglo-French alliance, the Franco-Czech, and Franco-Polish alliances, and the revision of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, which will become activity goals outside the formal agenda of the Moscow Conference.</p>
<h3>Jinnah Insists on the Partition of India and Pakistan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Karachi, 23rd] Muslim League leader Jinnah said in a speech here today that the Muslim League will not back down an inch from its demand for the partition of India and Pakistan. This was Jinnah's first public statement after the British government issued a statement, but he did not directly mention the British statement. Jinnah said: "The suffering of Muslims in Bihar and other places clearly shows that we should have an independent Muslim state within India. The Muslims of Bihar Province have made many sacrifices, which I am proud of. The sacrifices of these people are by no means in vain, they bring the goal of partition closer and closer, and they are ready to continue to sacrifice to reach this goal." At the same time, Masriqi, the leader of the Muslim Independence Party in New Delhi, said: "The withdrawal date set by the British army is the beginning of a massacre of Muslims. The British statement is a disguised prank."</p>

<h3>Security Council Agenda</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Lake Success, 23rd] Representatives of the United Nations Security Council are optimistic today that they can end the current stage of discussions on the atomic control issue this week, while resolving the dispute between Britain and Albania. The focus of the Security Council's work this week is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Albanian incident may end with the poetry collection on the 24th, or at another meeting at the weekend. (2) After discussions on the atomic control incident on the 25th, it will be returned to the Atomic Energy Commission, ordering it to continue its efforts to reconcile the views of the United States and the Soviet Union, so as to avoid a showdown between the two countries in the Security Council on the initial recommendations of the Atomic Energy Commission. (3) The United States' request that the former Japanese mandated territories in the Pacific be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations may be submitted for discussion on the 26th. It is reported that the US representative Youssef is prepared to request that this case be included in the agenda of that day's meeting, but those in charge said that Otto, in view of the opposition from Britain and the Soviet Union, does not intend to request immediate acceptance of the case.</p>
<h3>Marshall Supports Acheson; May Not Reply to Soviet Note; No Question of Acheson Resigning</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Official sources here predicted tonight that Secretary of State Marshall would firmly support Deputy Secretary of State Acheson's remarks that "the Soviet Union is adopting an aggressive and expansionist foreign policy." These sources also stated that Marshall had already made his position clear on Acheson's remarks before the Senate Atomic Energy Committee on the 10th of this month, and therefore firmly believes that Marshall will adhere to his position to the end. Government officials stated that the United States has not yet received the new note from Molotov to Marshall, as broadcast by Moscow Radio. Moscow Radio stated that Molotov's new note clarifies that the Soviet Union cannot accept Marshall's defense of Acheson's remarks. Diplomatic circles believe that if Marshall prepares to reply to this new note, he will merely reiterate his previous statements. However, it remains questionable whether Marshall will reply.</p>
<p>Some officials initially expressed their opinions on the potential impact of this heated exchange on the upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, suggesting that Marshall and Molotov might have a rocky start at the Moscow Conference. Others believe that Marshall and Molotov are merely trying to gain the upper hand before the Moscow Conference, and that this dispute will not be of great significance.</p>
<p>According to informed sources, they believe that Molotov's note is a test by the Kremlin of Marshall after he became Secretary of State. They also stated that Marshall's response to Acheson's alleged gaffe has made Moscow realize what they were trying to discover, that Marshall is not someone who can be easily intimidated by Moscow's tough tactics. They also pointed out that Marshall has always been a soldier, and his emergence as a politician is a product of circumstance, so he will definitely fight to the very end. Other sources believe that the Soviet Union is using pressure to force Acheson to resign, but Marshall immediately publicly defended Acheson, indicating that he will consistently support Acheson, and there is absolutely no question of Acheson resigning.</p>
<h3>Border Area Martial Law; Free Passage Prohibited</h3>

<h3>Shocking Nazi Plot: Threatening the British with Disease-Causing Bacteria; Attempting to Force Britain to Join an Anti-Soviet War</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 24th Broadcast: This time, the underground secret scheme to restore Germany is very large in scale. Today, British authorities continued to arrest many Nazis in their occupied zone in Germany and discovered their great secrets. According to the evidence obtained by Rosenberg, the British Nazi bacteriology expert, Germany prepared to propose to Britain the organization of a "Western Line Group" to wage war against the Soviet Union with bacteria, otherwise Nazi party members would destroy London with disease-causing bacteria. The expert, Rosenberg, wrote to the British authorities, requesting the restoration of German military strength, otherwise it would be secretly sold to the Soviet Union. Rosenberg claimed that 12 Germans could wipe out London, and 60 could wipe out the entire United Kingdom.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] U.S. and British occupation forces today uncovered a large-scale Nazi underground movement, whose personnel plotted to massacre the occupation forces with secret bacterial weapons. Several hundred people have been arrested, including a former German army colonel who participated in military affairs during the last war. This is the largest conspiracy case uncovered since the war, covering a wide range of the two occupied zones.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 24th] U.S. and British occupation authorities continued to arrest Germans last night to crush the underground Nazi conspiracy. It is rumored that this conspiracy extends throughout Germany and aims to revive German forces to "lead European countries against the Soviet Union." Arrested Nazis include several fugitive stormtrooper officers who claim to have secret bacterial weapons. Intelligence officers are rigorously interrogating the hundreds of arrested persons in order to gather clues and capture the secondary conspiracies of the underground group. U.S. military officials said that the headquarters of the underground group is apparently in the British defense zone.</p>

<h3>Far East Military Tribunal Reconvenes; Japanese Lawyers Still Quibbling; Fabricating Lies to Conceal the Truth from the World</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 24th] The Far East International Military Tribunal reconvened today, entering the defense phase. Japanese defense lawyer Kiyose first presented a comprehensive defense statement, which had been carefully revised by all the Japanese and American defense lawyers. The main points are as follows: (1) Individuals have no responsibility for actions based on national sovereignty; (2) Pre-war education and operational plans were not preparations for aggression, but were due to general ethical and economic conditions; (3) The so-called co-prosperity sphere, etc., were not aggressive in nature, and the special feelings of the Japanese people have been misunderstood; (4) The concept of conspiracy is only found in Anglo-American law and does not exist in international law; (5) It is inappropriate to add crimes related to peace and humanity to the concept of war crimes; (6) Homicide based on war is inappropriate; (7) The Northeast Incident and the Sino-Japanese Incident were acts of self-defense against provocation; (8) The Tripartite Pact and preparations against the Soviet Union were purely defensive in nature; (9) The Pacific War was the inevitable result of the relationship between Japan and the United States at the time and was purely a war of self-defense; (10) The United States was fully aware of the Pearl Harbor incident in advance by listening to the radio. The notification contained the content of a declaration of war. The fact that the notification was given after the start of the war was not the intention of the Japanese government, but was due to force majeure; (11) It is inappropriate to say that the Pearl Harbor incident was a surprise attack.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Defense Statement</h3>
<p>The defense statement claimed that Japan sympathized with China's self-existence and development, and had invited a large number of Chinese students since the mid-Meiji era, including President Chiang Kai-shek. Since the Chinese Revolution of 1911, the Japanese government and the public have expressed great goodwill towards Dr. Sun Yat-sen's cause. As the prosecutor pointed out, the General Staff Headquarters did draft operational plans every year, but China never established such comprehensive, hypothetical operational plans. The Northeast Incident, the Sino-Japanese Incident, and the Pacific War were all separate events with different specific causes, and there was no consistent plan between them. Japan never expected to engage in a full-scale war with China, so there was no overall plan. The statement also argued that Japan had to obtain special interests in Northeast China due to its large population, small land area, and restrictions on immigration by the United States. At that time, the Northeast government cooperated closely with Japan to maintain its power. Later, as the movement to restore national rights in China rose, the situation in the Northeast also changed. As the Kuomintang established branches in the Northeast, disputes between China and Japan gradually increased. The prosecutor believes that the railway bombing incident on the night of September 18, 1931, was planned by the Japanese side, but this is not the case. The emergence of "Manchukuo" was a spontaneous movement of the people in the Northeast. The responsibility for the Lugouqiao Incident does not lie with the Japanese side. If the incident could have been resolved locally at the time, it would not have escalated. At that time, Japan insisted on a non-expansion policy, and only demanded the clarification of North China and the abandonment of anti-Japanese policies in other places. In 1932, the Chinese side disregarded the Shanghai Truce Agreement and built fortifications in the demilitarized zone, concentrating more than 50,000 troops in Shanghai. At that time, the Japanese naval landing force stationed in Shanghai was less than 4,000 people, and the war in Central China occurred in this way. Japan had no economic aggression against China. At the same time, economic aggression itself is not a crime. The cruel acts committed by some Japanese troops in China are regrettable, but the facts have been excessively exaggerated, and some have been fabricated.</p>
<h3>Fierce Verbal Battle in Court</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] When the International Military Tribunal convened today, there was a fierce verbal battle between Judge Webb and the defendants, all due to the defendants' lawyers re-fighting the court's rules, jurisdiction, and interpretations of international law. The intensity of the argument was unprecedented since the Japanese war criminals were charged last April. Webb directly ordered Takayanagi, the lawyer of the defendant Suzuki, the former president of the Planning Board, to remove legal or border-related issues from his defense, and the verbal battle stopped. Webb stated that the court's rules restrict the defendant to presenting evidence only at this stage. Former Prime Minister Hiranuma, eighty years old, the oldest of the defendants, was unable to stand up when the judges entered the courtroom at the afternoon session and was taken out for examination. The doctor said that Hiranuma's condition was not serious.</p>
<h3>Shigemitsu, Doihara, and Others Oppose Kiyose's Defense Statement</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 24th] The defendants Shigemitsu, Hirota, Hiranuma, Doihara, Suzuki, and others stated today that they completely disagree with the defense statement presented by defense lawyer Kiyose, and declared that they reserve the right to make their own individual statements in the future. Defendant Oshima also stated that he did not agree with part of it. Today, the courtroom was brightly lit, and the sound of cameras never stopped. The VIP seats and the audience seats were all full.</p>

It is expected to be resolved this week. McNutt denied yesterday the rumors from Shanghai that he would be transferred to be the ambassador to China.</p>
<h3>Famous German Scientist Talks About Atomic Secrets</h3>
<p>The atomic bomb weighs twenty pounds and is the size of a volleyball. It is divided into two halves, each of which is absolutely safe, but if combined, the world will be turned upside down in an instant.</p>
<p>[United Press, Gottingen, Germany, 23rd] Heisenberg, Germany's top atomic scientist and winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics, announced today that the Soviet Union had invited German atomic scientists to conduct research for them for 6,000 rubles a month. Three people have now accepted the offer, and the monthly salary, calculated at the diplomatic exchange rate, is approximately US$500. Heisenberg also stated that the manufacture of atomic bombs is now an engineering problem in any country, and no longer a scientific problem. Germany had uranium piles hidden at the end of the war, which were later stolen by American spies. This uranium pile was originally intended to be used to generate atomic energy to supply power to machines, rather than to manufacture atomic bombs. At that time, there were two tons of uranium, two tons of heavy water, and ten tons of black ore hidden in Heigerloch, forty miles south of Stuttgart. Now, the entire world knows that the explosive material is produced from uranium piles. Heigerloch was occupied by French troops in 1945, but the French troops found nothing. All the uranium piles were transported away by American scientific intelligence personnel before the French troops knew about it. When they found out, the French troops were quite displeased.</p>
<p>Heisenberg and six assistants who jointly studied uranium with the Nazi government are now studying cosmic rays here under British military management. British officials have recently advised him not to accept the invitation of the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina to go and lecture, saying that this matter will definitely not be approved, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Heisenberg also stated that three German scientists working somewhere in the Soviet Union include Professor Hertz, who had manufactured atomic fission devices in Germany to break atoms, and who is an authoritative scientist in separating the isotope uranium-235 from uranium. There are also two others, one is the Leipzig physicist Dopel, and the other is Dr. Bewilogua, his wartime assistant. Last September, a German in the Soviet-occupied zone invited him to go to the Soviet Union to work on behalf of the Soviet government. In addition to a monthly salary of 6,000 rubles, he would also receive a special monthly allocation of 50 pounds of fresh meat, 3,500 calories of food per day for each of his six children, as well as a comfortable house, all free of charge. He very much wanted to stay in the country, so he politely declined at the time. He also does not want to research and manufacture atomic bombs for anyone. If he wants to go abroad, he would only take a short trip and give a few lectures, and would never engage in murderous weapons.</p>
<p>Three of his colleagues went to the Soviet Union not long after the end of the war. Among them, Dr. Bewilogua once worked in Crimea, but was suddenly transferred elsewhere. He cannot determine where he is now, but it is probably near the Ural Mountains. Italian scientist Fermi, who became an American citizen, also invited him to join the "Chicago Group," but he did not succeed. His only wish now is to lecture in the United States for some time, as he did before the war. As for the matter of building bombs, he absolutely does not want to hear about it.</p>
<p>He has read the "Smyth Report" published by the United States on the manufacturing process of atomic bombs. He generally understands how to manufacture atomic bombs, except for some technical details. The American military is quite dissatisfied that the "Smyth Report" was made public under pressure from scientists, resulting in the leakage of secrets. According to the "Smyth Report," he knows that the atomic bomb weighs twenty pounds and is the size of a volleyball. It is divided into two halves, each of which is absolutely safe, even if placed in a stove. But if the two halves are combined, an explosion will occur in an instant, creating a world-shattering situation.</p>
<p>Heisenberg was the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics. During the war, all atomic research in Germany was led by him. It is said that Germany's research achievements were on par with the United States, until the situation began to change in June 1942. On June 6 of that year, we reported to Armaments Minister Speer at a decisive meeting that atoms could be made to explode in two ways, one is to separate the isotope uranium-235 from uranium, and the other is to create uranium piles. However, Hitler was impatient and asked us when we could succeed. We replied two years or more. However, Hitler was unwilling to consider any military plan that exceeded six months. At that time, Hitler was thinking of seizing the Caucasus oil fields and the Suez Canal. In short, the manufacture of atomic bombs requires extremely large-scale industrial equipment, which Germany lacked, which was its fatal blow.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] The announcement by German scientist Heisenberg that the Soviet Union had invited German atomic scientists is not enough to produce atomic bombs. Soviet scientists probably know no less than German scientists about the principles of atomic bombs. Heisenberg said that the key to manufacturing atomic bombs is mostly in engineering. This statement is not very thorough. One problem is more related to science than engineering, that is, how to combine uranium or plutonium fragments at high speed for it to explode.</p>

<h3>Purchases of Gold Reach Over Two Thousand Bars; Investigation Confirms Speculation by Xinda Yarn Company; Sun Zixin, One of the Shanxi Gang's Tycoons, Flees in Fear of Punishment; One Official Among the First Batch of Blacklisted Individuals</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Among the major speculators in gold during the "gold rush" period, the Xinda Yarn Company has been confirmed by the Economic Supervisory Group to have factual evidence against it. The company purchased a total of 2,219 gold bars between January 22 and February 15. Its manager, Sun Zixin, is from Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, and is one of the tycoons of the so-called "Shanxi Gang" among the gold brokers in this city. It is understood that after purchasing the gold, he transported it to other cities by plane for profit. After several investigations by the Supervisory Group, the facts were confirmed, but Sun Zixin had already fled in fear of punishment. Chief Xuan ordered his arrest yesterday, and the case was handed over to the French Concession authorities for severe punishment. It is also learned that among the first batch of blacklisted individuals secretly submitted by the Supervisory Group to Chairman Chiang, there is a current official who used public funds for gold speculation, and the amount of gold he traded also reached several thousand bars. It is reported that the Chairman was extremely angry after receiving the report and has instructed that he be arrested and severely punished immediately. However, the person in charge of the Supervisory Group refused to reveal the name and identity of this "tiger" yesterday, or whether he had been arrested. It is also learned that the official's gold trading activities were very large, and the agency he served was located in another city, while he himself was active in Shanghai. It is expected that after the Supervisory Group arrests him, he will be handed over to a military tribunal for trial.</p>

<h3>"Fly" Cases Generally Transferred to Courts for Trial; Zhengtai and Other Three Factories Purchasing Gold; Not Constituting Speculation or Manipulation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Da Zhonghua Paper Factory, Shenghua Pharmaceutical Factory, etc., used production loans to purchase gold. After being investigated by the Four Joint Offices, the military law office of the Garrison Headquarters conducted preliminary summons. Because the total amount of gold purchased by the three companies was only over 140 bars, which was not enough to constitute the crime of speculation and manipulation, and the purchase date was before the Lunar New Year, which was not directly related to the gold rush after February 1, but because they obtained loans for non-production purposes and purchased gold, which was illegal, the Garrison Headquarters decided to transfer the case to the court for handling. The procedures were completed yesterday and will be transferred today. It is also learned that Commander Xuan has ordered that all cases of a "fly" nature be sent to the courts, and major cases will be tried by military law.</p>
<h3>Support and Loans Still Provided for Hardworking Manufacturers; Remarks by Person in Charge of Four Joint Offices</h3>
<p>An important person in charge of the Four Joint Offices stated to reporters yesterday: The purpose of the Four Joint Offices handling production loans is to support production businesses and encourage increased production. At that time, in order to prevent loans from flowing into improper uses, the fourth committee meeting stipulated that a roving audit team should be organized to check the accounts of borrowing factories at any time to verify the facts. The roving audit was jointly organized by two representatives from each of the four banks and one bureau, three representatives from commercial firms and industry and commerce guidance offices, and began work on February 1. Judging from the factories that have been inspected so far, the situation is generally good. Most factories have been able to increase production due to the production loans they have received. However, a very small number of factories have indeed used loans to purchase gold and U.S. dollars. In addition to setting a deadline for recovering the loans and transferring them to the competent authorities for punishment according to law, the office will continue to support the majority of hardworking manufacturers in accordance with the purpose of rewarding production businesses, and hopes that the persons in charge of each factory will stand on their own and work hard.</p>

<h3>Major Robbery Case on the Beijing-Shanghai Train Solved in 44 Hours - Lone Bandit Leaps Out of the Train - Carries Loot and Flees, Captured in Hospital</h3>
<p>At 6 p.m. on the 21st of this month, the 15th express train was driving from Beijing to Shanghai. When passing between Xixiang and Lujiabang, a passenger named Lu Qinan and Liu Jingcheng, who had a leather suitcase of cash worth 15 million yuan, was suddenly robbed by a bandit wearing a uniform and a symbol in the same car. After the robbery, he jumped out of the train regardless of his body and disappeared. After the train arrived at Shanghai North Station, the victims immediately reported to the police station. Chief Wang Zhaohuai was furious upon hearing the report, as there had never been a robbery case on the train in broad daylight in the history of the two routes, so he immediately ordered Section Chief Zhang Hanying and Inspector Min Jianchu to be responsible for the arrest. After Zhang received the order, he immediately sent Inspector Shuai Ying to lead more than 20 officers to investigate and arrest. They found clues at the home of Wang Zixin in Shatuo Gexiang Ditoupu, 48 miles from the railway line.</p>
<p>It turned out that after the bandit jumped down with the stolen money, he was seriously injured. At that time, knowing that police officers were hunting him, he reluctantly escaped with the money, and that night he escaped to Wang Zixin's home in Shage Village, where he borrowed for one night with 30,000 yuan of legal tender. He then purchased a woolen cloth coat for 150,000 yuan, replaced the original military uniform, and threw the weapon into the manure tank. The next day, he hired a small boat to Xiajiaqiao, and then took a train from Lujiabang to Shanghai. After the police officers obtained this important clue, they transported it back to Shanghai overnight. Based on their experience in handling cases, they knew that the bandit was seriously injured and would definitely seek medical treatment, so they secretly investigated in various hospitals.</p>
<p>Inspector Min then learned from a rickshaw driver that the bandit had taken a ride to Jimin Hospital after getting off the train. So he met with the North Station Police Station and went to Jimin Hospital. Min disguised himself as a doctor and arrested the bandit on the spot in a flash, seizing the original stolen goods. The bandit confessed that he had served as a student soldier, named Li Jiayao, and was scheduled to be transferred to the court for strict handling today. It was found that it only took 44 hours from the occurrence of the case to the investigation and detection. (The picture above shows the captured bandit Li Jiayao and part of the seized original stolen goods. Photo by China News Agency)</p>
<p>State-Owned Enterprises Request Price Increases - Social Bureau Believes the Timing is Inappropriate</p>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, said yesterday that the government's announced economic emergency measures will freeze the January cost of living index and provide daily necessities at parity prices as compensation. As for the quantity of various items, Mayor Wu believes that the quantity at the time of the previous compilation of the cost of living index should be the standard. He has now submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, and it will be announced after approval. In order to save the current economic crisis, he hopes that everyone will think of the country and the nation and be able to sacrifice their own interests. The Social Bureau still has methods to rectify labor discipline, but it is very disappointed that some capitalists, such as the hotel industry, do not comply with government laws. In the future, the Social Bureau will take the initiative in controlling negotiated prices. Furthermore, due to the chaotic execution of cracking down on violating price agreements in the past, the Social Bureau will unite with the Police Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters to uniformly implement it in the near future. Regarding the recent request for price increases by state-owned enterprises, Wu believes that although losses are a fact, it does not seem appropriate to raise prices during this period.</p>
<p>Party, Government, Military, and Police Agencies Hold Expanded Memorial Week</p>
<p>All circles in Shanghai held an expanded Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday morning. More than a thousand representatives from party, government, military, police, and group agencies attended. Director Fang, Chairman of the Municipal Party Department, presided over the meeting and led the ceremony. Fang then made a few points, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First, I want to tell the responsible comrades of the party branches in various districts of this city that the division and adjustment of the party branches in various districts are always being actively carried out, so that every comrade is assigned to a district branch, and every party branch effectively allocates its affiliated district branches, so as to formally elect representatives and hold the city's party member representative meeting to elect the executive and supervisory committees of the municipal party department. In the future, how to strengthen the organization of district branches so that party work can be carried out smoothly is something that our comrades should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Second, yesterday's newspaper reported that the Municipal Council, local associations, municipal chamber of commerce, educational association, general labor union, women's association, agricultural association, and other seven groups jointly telegraphed their respects to the soldiers at the front. There were many heavy sentences that made us feel infinite emotion after reading them. The soldiers at the front are suppressing the chaos for peace and sacrificing for unity, which is exactly the ancient people's "using war to stop war". I believe that the soldiers at the front will have infinite feelings after reading this tribute telegram. Everyone here today must be extra vigilant and do their best.</p>
<p>Third, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the government recently promulgated the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan." This is a method of competing for the people. Although this plan can save the current economic crisis, it must remove the currency along with the advantages, so it cannot be fully satisfactory. Selfish elements are taking the opportunity to spread rumors and maliciously slander. It must be known that today's government is the people's government, and always cares about the suffering of the vast majority of the people, and is always working for the benefit of the people. Even if there are things that need to be added to the promulgated plan, I think the government will definitely respect public opinion and consider it. This point, I hope all comrades will pay attention to.</p>
<p>After the speech, the whole audience was led to read the party member's code of conduct, and the meeting was adjourned at around 10 o'clock.</p>

<h3>Swire Wharf Suffers Further Disturbances - Loading and Unloading Work Halted</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] The dispute over the work of the foremen of the warehouses at Swire Company's Puxi Wharf, Chen Shanyu and Zhou Ruisun, has lasted for nearly half a year. Yesterday morning, workers holding wooden sticks and bamboo poles suddenly appeared from Xinkaihe Minguo Road to Swire Wharf. At that time, the workers on Chen's side were afraid of a conflict when the Shenjing ship docked at the wharf, so they did not dare to work and sent personnel to the Huangpu Branch to request police protection. The branch sent police to the wharf, and Section Chief Ling personally went to the wharf at 11 o'clock to advise them, but it was reported that the workers had no foreman to preside over, so it was impossible to persuade them to disperse. It was also learned that the foreman was Hu Changzhi, from Hubei, but he was not present at the time, so it was impossible to contact him. Now the loading and unloading work at the Swire Wharf machine room has stopped again, and there is no good solution for the time being.</p>

Li Tingliang, her husband, suddenly came to Shanghai from his hometown the day before yesterday and insisted on asking the owner to advance some salary, but Xie refused because he had borrowed two months' salary a few days ago. Li then planned to take Li back to his hometown as a threat to change jobs.

<h3>Five Measures Set by Land Bureau to Apply for Land Value Tax Exemption for the Principal</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] The Land Administration Bureau has recently received many submissions requesting exemption from land value tax. The applicants include trade associations, private schools, private charities, land owners whose land has been taken over by government agencies or occupied by refugees to build sheds, etc. It is now known that the bureau's handling methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Trade associations are not organizations that run public welfare causes, so they cannot be exempted. (2) Private schools that have been registered and have achieved good results can be exempted from the land value tax on the land directly used by the school, and other school properties must be paid as required. (3) Private charities that have been running relief undertakings for more than five years and have achieved results, and whose land is not for profit purposes, can apply for tax exemption with documents, and others must pay as required. (4) Land requisitioned and enclosed by the enemy and puppets, and taken over by government agencies after victory, cannot be exempted according to law. Now, in consideration of the owners' situation, they are allowed to postpone payment. However, a certification letter must be issued by the current user agency, proving that it is used free of charge. If it is decided to return it in the future, the owner shall make up the payment. If it is decided to be requisitioned by the government, the current user agency shall make up the land value tax. (5) Refugees occupying other people's land to build sheds is illegal, but in this period of serious housing shortage, if they are determined to demolish the houses and evict them, it is also difficult in fact. Under these circumstances, if the owner is required to bear the land value tax again, it is legally compliant, but may be lacking in affection. How should this matter be handled? The municipal government has now been consulted.</p>
<h3>Seymour Road Fire Case - Shen Qiulin Prosecuted - Cable is Damp and Inattentive - Party Discernment is No Crime but Guilty</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] The couple Shen Qiulin, who caused the fire on Seymour Road, were transferred by the police station to the local prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution on the charge of public danger. Now, after the prosecutor Shen Zushou concluded the investigation, he believed that Shen Shen's crime was insufficient and decided not to prosecute, while Shen Qiulin was prosecuted according to Article 173, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. His indictment stated: "Shen Qiulin rented a house at No. 425 Gordon Road Wuding Road to open a coppersmith shop. In October last year, because the cable was too old, he replaced it himself. However, this is not his forte, and the installation technology is inevitably clumsy, and the house is dilapidated. When it rains, the roof leaks, and the cable is damp. On January 22 this year, it rained again. At 9:30 p.m., the cable was soaked in water and short-circuited, causing the wooden boards on the roof to catch fire. After investigation by the police station, it was believed that there was suspicion of fire, and it was transferred to the investigation office. The defendant Shen Qiulin has admitted that he replaced the cable himself in October last year, and that it was soaked in water whenever it rained. It is a very common sense that the cable is easy to short-circuit when it is damp. Since the cable installed in the house is soaked in rain every day, it should be repaired early to prevent it before it happens. However, he was inattentive. Moreover, the defendant had no special research on installing cables, and his poor technology is conceivable. If the cable was installed properly at that time, or there would not have been a disaster. The defendant should have paid attention to this common sense, but he did not, and he actually committed the crime of Article 173, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Since he is entitled to be exempted from punishment, he is prosecuted according to Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Prosecutor Shen Zushou."</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Pen Questions - Injustice Difficult to Rectify</h3>
<p>Xu Weigang asks: My relative was murdered, and the case was brought to court. However, due to the court's careless handling and the defendant's cunning deception, his son has repeatedly been unable to obtain justice and suffers from unresolved grievances. I have specific doubts and humbly request detailed answers: (1) During the investigation and trial, the complainant was not summoned to participate. Is this legal? Does it conflict with the first half of Article 63 of the Criminal Procedure Law? (2) The defendant and witnesses were not questioned separately as required by Article 97 and Article 171 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Despite repeated requests from the complainant, the defendant and witnesses were able to make eye contact and collude tacitly. What methods can be used to prevent this? (3) The indictment did not follow Article 242, applying Article 234, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and item 11 of the Points for Attention in Handling Criminal Procedure Cases, to be served on the complainant, leaving the complainant completely unaware of the indictment's intent. Furthermore, there was no way to supplement or challenge the identified criminal facts and evidence, leading to an erroneous first-instance judgment. Is the prosecutor responsible for this? (4) When a murderer is identified and accused, regardless of whether the accusation is true, they should be detained and investigated. The accuser bears the responsibility for false accusations. However, the prosecutor did not directly arrest the accused but used a summons, allowing the accused to escape leisurely. Can I request the Ministry of Judicial Administration or the Supreme Court to replace the prosecutor or directly accuse the prosecutor of dereliction of duty? (5) Given the situation in point three, if the judge bases the sentence on the prosecutor's erroneous findings and gives the defendant a lenient sentence, can the complainant appeal? (6) Is it necessary to serve the judgment on the complainant? If the complainant wants to appeal or request a retrial, can they request its service? (7) Is the right to request a retrial exclusive to the prosecutor? Can the complainant request it? And is it necessary to declare disagreement in advance within the appeal period? (8) Requesting a retrial is not limited to the appeal period, and there is no explicit provision in the Criminal Procedure Law for declaring disagreement in advance. However, item 100 of the Points for Attention in Handling Criminal Procedure Cases discusses it. Why is this?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Duanmu Kai] (1) It is not without conflict. (2) You can apply to the prosecutor for recusal according to Article 18, paragraph 2, and Article 26 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (3) It is punishable.

<p>A Sympathetic Helping Hand</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang's Letter Responds to Donation</p>
<p>This column yesterday received a letter from a reader stating: "Dear Editor, I was deeply moved by reading about your newspaper's promotion of free midwifery services. It truly embodies what your newspaper calls 'our infinite sympathy for these unfortunate people.' However, my abilities are weak, and I am not sufficient to advocate for such a cause among gentlemen. Therefore, I enclose a postdated check for 20,000 yuan to contribute my meager strength. Please put it to good use to create a protective garment (for those in need). I am exceedingly hopeful. Sincerely, Wang Maihuicong. February 22nd, Year 30."</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education is Actively Supplementing Library Books and Equipment for Universities; Middle Schools Plan to Manufacture Their Own Instruments and Specimens</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 23rd] Because the equipment of various schools suffered excessive damage during the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education allocated one million U.S. dollars during the war to purchase books and equipment. At that time, due to the blockade of seaports, foreign goods were transported internally through Yangon. When the Pacific War broke out and Yangon fell, over 170 crates of books and equipment were lost. 115 crates were rescued and transported to Chongqing. Later, over 700 crates were airlifted from Kolkata to Kunming and then distributed to various schools. After the victory, 335 crates of books and equipment and 799 crates of magazines that were still abroad were transported to Shanghai and are being processed separately. The Ministry of Education has been actively seeking to replenish the equipment of various schools this year and is actively proceeding with the following outline: (1) The American Library Association is helping to raise 100,000 books, and six crates have already arrived. Additionally, the Greater Boston Book Donation Committee in the United States has also donated 72 crates. The American Library Association has also donated books to several universities and research institutions in China. (2) The British Council is collecting 19 kinds of famous English books in Sweden, with over 4,000 copies of each. Seven crates, totaling over 16,000 copies, have arrived, and 30 sets of British wartime books have been purchased, with over 100 crates already arrived. (3) The losses to Chinese education and culture during the war were enormous. An application was made to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for assistance, and US$4 million was approved to supplement the equipment of colleges of arts, science, engineering, agriculture and medicine in the recovered areas. The Ministry of Education has sent personnel to contact and proceed with this matter. (4) In order to meet the needs of schools relocated to the rear, the Ministry of Education purchased seven sets of machinery for mechanical engineering and experimental factories when the Production Bureau was closed and distributed them to various schools. (5) The Ministry of Education allocated the remaining US$200,000+ from the construction fund to schools in the rear and National Normal College to enhance their equipment. The above concerns colleges and universities. As for secondary schools, the Ministry of Education intends to manufacture instruments and specimens domestically and has relocated the Science Instrument Creation Institute and the Museum Specimen Manufacturing Institute from Sichuan to the Beijing-Shanghai area, increasing funding, purchasing equipment, and expanding the scale, aiming to create a large-scale factory in China as a model for manufacturing factories in various provinces and cities. Therefore, all scientific instruments and specimens are planned to be manufactured domestically. To meet current urgent needs, the Ministry of Education recently distributed 1,048 sets of scientific instruments previously manufactured by the Academia Sinica to national secondary schools and education bureaus in various provinces and cities for use by provincial and municipal secondary schools.</p>

<p>The First Division League match between Donghua and Youyou is a makeup game from the first round. Donghua has won all seven of its games and is in high spirits. The latter is also one of the strongest Chinese teams in this year's First Division, with excellent results in the league. However, after Italian players Villa, Borrini, and Latti returned to their country, although three more Italian players have come, their strength is no longer what it was. They may not be a match for Donghua. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>(2) Players registered in the Second and Third Divisions who have not submitted their photos will be treated as unregistered. If it is confirmed during the photo verification that a player participating in the match does not have a photo, the team to which the player without a photo belongs will be deemed to have forfeited the match. Team leaders should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Schedule for the Finals of the Second and Third Divisions</h3>

<p>Second Division: Qingbai vs. Shanyun. The winner will play against Railway in the final. Third Division: Customs vs. Dongchang.

<p>Railway vs. Jingwu. The winner will play against Hengyi Sheng in the final.</p>
<h3>Soccer Friendly: Railway vs. Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball League: Black Meets Encas</h3>
<p>Chenyou vs. Indian; Green Forest vs. Railway Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Report] There will be three Basketball League games tonight, starting at 5:30 PM, continuing the competition at the Municipal Gymnasium. The first match is between Chenyou and Indian in the first division. Chenyou has won all five of its games since defeating Green Forest and is close to securing the championship. Indian, after losing to Beer, seems destined to be at the bottom of the league. Tonight's match can be called a battle between the "champion" and "last place" teams.</p>
<p>The second match in the same group is between Green Forest and Railway Shanghai. This match is not important. If Green Forest wins, with two losses in seven games, it can get the runner-up in the second division.</p>
<p>The main event is between All Black and Encas. Encas is a strong Western team. All Black is a mixed group, and it is likely to lose to the foreign army. Under the strong defense of foreign generals Changren Ge Pengqikefu and Baolai, Lu Dazhen of All Black will find it difficult to find opportunities, and Zhang Shaoxiang's "solo run" will also be blocked. All three matches tonight are likely to be one-sided. The schedules for each match are as follows:</p>
<p>Chenyou - Indian (Second Division) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Green Forest - Railway (Second Division) 6:30 PM Referee: Chen Baolin</p>

Bran experienced a real consumption turnaround in rural villages, advancing by 2,000 to 3,000 (currency unit).</p>
<p>The same was true for yellow soybeans. The opening of Hankou soybeans and Doudou beans all saw a consistent increase of 2,000 to 3,000 (currency unit), but there were no transactions at the close, and the situation turned weak. Northeastern soybeans had no significant changes.</p>
<p>The arrival of red sorghum gradually increased, but there were few buyers, and it fell by 2,000 to 3,000 (currency unit). Corn from Qingdao was actively handled, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 (currency unit). Green beans were absorbed by Southeast Asia, and the market was lively. Red beans saw brisk sales to Hong Kong, rising again by 3,000 to 4,000 (currency unit). Sesame also increased by 5,000 to 6,000 (currency unit). Raw kernels were firm and stable, with no temporary changes.</p>
<h3>Market Prices Higher Than Purchase Prices: Autumn Silk Purchases Not Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>After China Trust (Zhongxin) began purchasing autumn silk, initially, due to market prices being lower than purchase prices, the quantity of autumn silk and zero-dried spring silk delivered by various factories was quite large. From January to mid-February, the China Silk Company received approximately 1,300 dan (unit of weight). Subsequently, due to market prices being higher than purchase prices, factories rushed to sell in the market, and since mid-February, the delivery work has stalled again.</p>
<h3>Bread and Biscuit Industry: Requesting Increased Flour Allocation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Flour Trade Association: The association recently received a request from the bread and biscuit industry, stating that the industry needs 2,000 bags of flour per day, while the actual allocation is only 905 bags. At the same time, the people's livelihood canteens bake inexpensive bread, needing 50 bags of flour per day, while the actual allocation is only 12 bags. However, the noodle-cutting industry receives 4,500 bags of flour per day, with each shop receiving a maximum of 20 bags and a minimum of one bag. In reality, there is a surplus of more than 1,000 bags per day. Therefore, they are currently considering how to transfer this surplus allocation to compensate for the shortage of flour for the bread, biscuit, and people's livelihood canteens.</p>
<h3>Market Liquidity Gradually Easing: Hot Money Turning to Real Estate</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] A senior financial figure said: The city's liquidity has eased, and in addition to the stock market as a target, hot money is trending toward real estate activities. From the government's standpoint, it is most desirable for hot money to be deposited in banks. If this is not possible, it is hoped that it will not be directed toward paths harmful to people's livelihood. Therefore, if hot money goes into real estate activities, it is undoubtedly good news. In terms of listed interest rates, some people in the city advocate for an increase, but from the government's standpoint, this is too closely related to industry and commerce and is inconvenient to increase. When asked by reporters if interest rates could fall, the answer was: This depends on changes in prices. If prices are stable, interest rates are also stable. Interest rates can only fall if prices fall. Regarding the business of general banks in the city, the person believes that most are stable, and very few are engaged in gold speculation. Currently, the Ministry of Finance is actively investigating, and the outside world should not speculate too much to avoid "a lot of noise, but little rain." As for the future inspection of banks, the procedures will be simplified as much as possible to increase efficiency.</p>
<h3>Before New Measures Are Announced: Individuals Applying for Foreign Exchange, Designated Banks Are Not Allowed to Accept</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank issued Circular No. 84 yesterday to various designated banks, stating: In order to comply with government regulations, before the amended measures are announced, banks should not accept applications for foreign exchange required by individuals thereafter.</p>
<h3>Remittances from Overseas Have Improved</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] It is reported that since the foreign exchange adjustment, the situation of remittances from overseas has improved slightly. For example, in the past, there were no remittances from the Philippines, but recently, more than 100,000 US dollars have been remitted to Longjian. New York has always been a major source of overseas remittances for our country. Although there are no detailed statistics recently, it is certainly known that there has been an increase.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Shares Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The volume of government bond transactions yesterday was limited, no more than 2 million (currency unit). The opening price for Tongbing (government bond) was 8,000 (currency unit), sold at 360 Binlong Lianhe, falling to 6,000 (currency unit). 552 Chen De slightly increased, and finally hovered around 6,300 (currency unit), resulting in a drop of 1,300 (currency unit) compared to the previous closing price. Jiayi and Yiyi (government bonds) fell by 500 (currency unit), and Dingwu (government bond) fell by 700 (currency unit).</p>
<p>Foreign shares continued to decline yesterday, with decreasing volume. Jardine Spinning declined gradually from 18,300 (currency unit) and closed at a low price. Steel and shipping each fell by half, Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels and Kwangtung Paper each fell by 10%, and Jardine Spinning, British American Tobacco and Jardine Brewery each fell by slightly more than 5% compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Import Quota Period: Extended to June, Lianzong Will Ship 200,000 Bales of Cotton to China</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Quota Allocation Office of the Import and Export Control Commission held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday and adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM. Several agenda items were discussed. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The allocation of quotas to each factory is based on: (A) the number of spindles actually reported by each factory, (B) the amount of cotton in stock in each factory's warehouse, and (C) according to the rules for purchasing foreign cotton, factories with cotton stocks sufficient for four months and orders sufficient for three months. Based on the above figures, the amount of cotton required by each factory in the first quarter of this year is calculated to be 368,000 bales. However, the foreign cotton import quota announced by the Quota Allocation Office for February to April of this year is US$40 million. According to the current exchange rate, only 230,000 bales of cotton can be purchased, which is still short of the actual demand. In the future, it can only be allocated to each factory proportionally. At yesterday's meeting, the proportional quota figures for each factory were handed over to the factories to take back for review and will be discussed at the next meeting. (2) Of the six factories that previously urgently applied for foreign cotton, four factories have now been approved and issued licenses separately. The remaining two factories are awaiting review and approval. (3) It is reported that Lianzong (UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) may ship 200,000 bales of cotton to China. If each factory obtains this cotton, the allocation of foreign cotton will be proportionally reduced because each factory's equipment has a fixed amount of cotton consumption. (4) The foreign cotton import quota of US$40.3 million for February to April of this year has now been decided to be extended to the end of June.</p>
<h3>Silver Industry Announces to the Press: Asking for Sympathy and Assistance from All Parties, Planning to Make Three Demands Together with the Government</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The silver industry hosted the city's press at the Atlantic Hotel yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM. During the event, Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, and other members of the Silver Industry Salvation and Survival Committee read out an emergency announcement from silver industry colleagues in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to colleagues across the country, appealing to people across the country to grant sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>The general idea is that the measures for handling gold ornaments promulgated by the Ministry of Finance will make it impossible for the livelihoods of millions of employees in the silver industry across the country to be maintained. The buying and selling of gold ornaments was originally a disguised form of savings for the people. Prohibiting the buying and selling of gold ornaments will inevitably cause the surplus funds of the general middle and lower classes to turn to hoarding goods, leading to rising prices. This time, the government's crackdown on speculation in gold and banknotes has caused the honest and law-abiding silver industry to suffer the hardship of destruction and unemployment, punishing the innocent. This is inappropriate point one. The government allocated gold at a high price of 7.7 million (currency unit) and ordered the silver industry to return it at a price of 4.8 million (currency unit). The Central Bank is gaining inappropriate profits. This is inappropriate point two. The holding of gold is not prohibited, but gold ornaments are uniquely required to be recalled within a limited time, which is unreasonable. This is inappropriate point three. After Yao finished reading, Zhang Jisheng, the representative of the silver industry workers, spoke. He asked the media to give assistance.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, they will petition in Beijing</p>
<p>It is heard that industry representatives will petition the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Government at approximately 10:00 AM tomorrow and will unite with representatives from various places on the 26th to petition the central government. Currently, there are Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hankou, Yichang, Chengdu, Nanjing, Xi'an, Jinan, Nanchang, Shantou, Kunming, Chongqing, Liuzhou, and other silver industries that support the Shanghai silver industry's claims and express their determination to act in unison with Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the Silver Industry Association has agreed on three principles: (1) Cancel the provisions for limited-time registration, limited-time sales, and mandatory exchange for national currency. Allow industry colleagues to engage in the collection, processing, and sale of gold ornaments. (2) Allow industry colleagues to apply to the Central Bank for the allocation and sale of original gold to meet the needs of the people. (3) Unite representatives from various places on the 26th to petition the central government.</p>
<h3>Silver Money Industry Joint Preparatory Committee: Suspending Public Treasury Lending</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Silver Money Industry Joint Preparatory Committee recently announced that after the government promulgated the new economic emergency measures, the 5 billion (currency unit) of working capital previously allocated to the committee by the Central Bank would no longer be allocated. Therefore, the committee's public treasury lending business has also been temporarily suspended. However, the committee's organizational structure will continue to exist in anticipation of future needs. As for the reserve assets deposited by each bank, it will be decided whether to return them based on the needs of each bank.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Transactions Occur: Domestic Purchasing Power Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Since the foreign exchange restrictions, the Tung Oil Association agreed to a price of 460,000 (currency unit), and transactions occurred in the market yesterday. However, according to merchants, although Tung oil prices have reached a peak, the current price in Hankou is 400,000 (currency unit) per dan, freight costs 30,000 (currency unit), and the time taken is at least seven days, plus three days for unloading, for a total interest cost of 27,000 (currency unit). Therefore, the price of arriving goods is almost the same as the current selling price in Shanghai. It is difficult to break the deadlock in the transportation and export of Tung oil for a while. For domestic sales of Tung oil, as the price has become divorced from purchasing power, actual sales have dropped sharply.</p>
<h3>Chinese Shares Opened High and then Fell Low: Opportunities to Buy on the Dip, Turning Bullish Near Closing</h3>
<p>Although the sentiment outside the market was good yesterday, Chinese shares were suppressed by large yarn and cotton companies, opening high and then falling low.

No. 220 and 31 took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and the price slightly pulled back after being high. Nos. 218, 13, 117, 152 and 145 were sold, gradually falling back and struggling. Finally, it broke into 2,400 (currency unit). Nos. 133, 152, 105, 76, 137 and 218 continuously supplied goods, and finally fell back to 223 (currency unit). Nos. 198, 13 and 215 came in on the dip, rising to 2,290 (currency unit). Nos. 137, 85 and 145 still sold. The afternoon closing was still weak. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongsheng yarn, Xinnuo and Xinguang were slightly lower, Huafeng fell by 5%, and Qinxing, Jingfu and Meiya fell by 10%. The deferred delivery of Yongsheng yarn, Xinnuo, Huafeng and Xinguang fell by about 5%, Meiya fell by 10%. Cold shares such as Commerce, Match, Yonggong, Jinglun, Lilian, Cement and Xinya fell by 5% to 10%. The rest of the rises and falls were minor.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the volume of transactions was very small. Nos. 180, 14, 186, 76 and 219 had gains. The deferred delivery of Yongsheng yarn rose to 2,350 (currency unit). No. 13 was sold, falling back to 2,290 (currency unit). No. 198 and retail investors all came in and struggled. Although Nos. 13, 22, 145 and 76 and 224 sold off Nos. 85, 61 and 197, they fell to 2,140 (currency unit). Meiya near delivery was sold from 203 (currency unit) to the limit down.

Nos. 145, 198 and 152 all came in. Nos. 224 and 12 also bought. The final attack turned bullish. Datong was raised from 220 (currency unit) to the limit up. After the close, it was once shouted up to 2,300 (currency unit), and finally was around 2,260 (currency unit), because there was a short covering situation outside the market. The spot Yongsheng yarn is higher than the deferred delivery. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yongsheng yarn slightly fell, Xinnuo, Huafeng, Jingfu and Qinxing each fell by about 10%, Xinguang fell by 5%, Meiya fell by 15%.

<h3>Saving Chinese Tea Exports: Urgent Need to Seek Self-Improvement</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] According to a tea industry magnate: China's major export, tea, has ultimately not improved due to domestic production costs being higher than overseas selling prices. Our government authorities are concerned about Chinese tea and have implemented various favorable policies such as loans, and have adjusted the exchange rate against the US dollar from 2,020 (currency unit) to 12,000 (currency unit). Although domestic tea prices have followed other commodities and risen sharply, if the tea price is close to overseas price currently, the sellers are still reluctant to sell at bargain and unwilling to give up. Recently, the United Kingdom has seen that Chinese tea production methods are conservative, the products are inconsistent, and the selling prices are surprisingly high. In order to remedy the urgent need, they have turned to other countries. Looking at this situation, if Chinese tea merchants do not seek a way to save themselves, exports may be on the verge of extinction.</p>
<h3>Qihong Sellers Hoarding</h3>
<p>The Zhengmen black tea, which has been stalled for many days, still did not show any progress in the market yesterday. Although British export firms are still negotiating with sellers, the sellers are not willing to relax their prices. Chenzhong Qimen is firmly selling at 500,000 (currency unit) per dan, while buyers are offering around 440,000 to 450,000 (currency unit). Therefore, whether or not a transaction will occur is still brewing. Other varieties, such as green tea such as Chouzhen and Zhenjie, which are sold to Africa, are still active and thriving, and the market is quite stable. It is said that local stores in various styles of domestic tea and the Suzhou gangs are frequently paying attention, but the supply and demand are imbalanced, so there is a quiet situation.</p>
<h3>Sugimoto Market Sentiment Firming</h3>
<p>Although foreign pine wood has arrived, the actual lock is limited and has not completely broken free from the weakness.</p>
<h3>Imported Goods Prices: Recent Consistent Return to Equilibrium, Woolen Fabrics Rise by 30% to 40% Due to Shortages</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Since the new foreign exchange rate was announced on the 16th of this month, the prices of China's export goods have fluctuated. The prices of imported goods have returned to equilibrium compared to the peak period. The price fluctuations of paper, dyes, rubber, western medicine, woolen fabrics, etc., are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Paper: Prices have risen sharply due to the difficulty of importing foreign goods, the lack of domestic raw materials, the high price of gold, and the relationship between supply and demand. On the 6th of this month, Canadian newsprint was 65,000 (currency unit) per ream. When the price of gold reached its peak, the price of paper also rose to 150,000 (currency unit) per ream. After the new foreign exchange rate was announced, it gradually returned to equilibrium. The price the day before yesterday was 110,000 (currency unit) per ream. 38-pound Daolin paper was 240,000 (currency unit) per ream at the highest price of gold, and it returned to 230,000 (currency unit) the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Dyes: Prices have also risen sharply in the past. From the 10th to the 16th of this month, they hovered at the highest peak. After the foreign exchange rate was announced, there was a slight decline. The price of 693 Chemical Yuan was 8.8 million (currency unit) on the 16th of this month, and the price yesterday was 8.25 million (currency unit). The price of Five Horses Zhu (vermilion) was 500,000 (currency unit) per 10 jin (unit of weight) on the 16th of this month, and the price yesterday was 350,000 (currency unit). The price of Samsung Gray was 580,000 (currency unit) per 10 jin (unit of weight) on the 16th of this month, and the price yesterday was 400,000 (currency unit). All prices fell back.</p>
<p>Rubber: The price was only 900 (currency unit) per pound in November last year and rose to more than 2,000 (currency unit) in January this year. At the peak of the gold rush, it rose to 14,500 (currency unit) per pound. After the new foreign exchange was announced, it gradually fell back, and the price yesterday was 6,000 (currency unit) per pound, more than halved compared to the highest peak.</p>
<p>Western medicine: Prices are most clearly affected by the US dollar. The peak of the US dollar was also the peak of western medicine. On the 16th of this month, American goods Xiafadeya (a medicine, phonetic translation) was sold to 250,000 (currency unit) per 1,000 tablets, and yesterday it had returned to 185,000 (currency unit). Pai Le Tuo (a medicine, phonetic translation) was sold to 100,000 (currency unit) per box at the highest, and yesterday it was 80,000 (currency unit) per box. Ke Ning (a medicine, phonetic translation) powder was 30,000 (currency unit) per tin at the highest, and yesterday it was 25,000 (currency unit). Other such as sugar, quinine, Dong Shi Wei Xiong (a medicine, phonetic translation), etc., have all accumulated declines. On average, the price of general western medicine is 20% lower than before the announcement of the new foreign exchange rate.</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics: Prices are not much higher for wholesale due to actual sales and other factors. Comparing the prices on the 16th of this month with yesterday, the price of Ni Ao (a type of woolen fabric, phonetic translation) rose by 15%, but the retail prices of woolen fabrics with better quality have risen by 30% to 40% due to shortages.</p>
<p>This time, the foreign exchange was the highest, but the prices of imported goods have fallen back, the reason is that the prices of general goods have followed the US dollar and risen to the highest peak, and the regulations for the imported goods to increase the tax were calculated according to the black market price, so the prices have risen sharply. After the new foreign exchange rate was announced, the tax measures were canceled, the black market disappeared, and the prices returned to equilibrium.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Depressed</h3>
<p>Spinning and Construction Sales of More Than 1,000 Pieces</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market was depressed and could not be revived. Customers were waiting because the price was low inland, and cloth factories were not interested in buying because the sales of woven products were sluggish. Therefore, the yarn market continued to soften, and sentiment was not encouraging. Since the bottom price was already low, the decline was still small, only slightly declining by 131 (currency unit).</p>
<p>China Spinning and Construction Company sold yarn on behalf of the Spinning Management Committee yesterday as usual, selling a total of 1,030 pieces, including 626 pieces for domestic manufacturers and 404 pieces for yarn numbers. The total number of applicants was 292, including 176 domestic manufacturers and 116 yarn numbers.</p>
<h3>Foreign Banks: Not Allowed to Buy or Sell Gold or Banknotes</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, on the 24th, speaking to reporters: (1) Foreign banks are not allowed to accept gold deposits, (2) Foreign banks are not allowed to buy or sell gold or US dollars. The above are based on the provisions of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, (3) Large households hoarding gold affects social interests and is also a violation of criminal law.</p>
<p>[In addition] The investigation work of the gold and banknotes team of the Supervisory Group is proceeding smoothly and is still continuing to be investigated. Foreign banks and companies are all under investigation.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Association Investigates Inventory</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Cotton Cloth Business Association of this city convened a meeting of directors and supervisors at its premises at 3:00 PM yesterday. All directors and supervisors of the association, as well as district chiefs from various districts, attended, with Dong Jiufeng serving as chairman. Following discussions, it was decided that all member cloth shops should submit a list to the association detailing their cotton cloth inventory as of the end of February.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the future market for cotton cloth weakened yesterday. Upon hearing of the need for registration, there was public anxiety, and market prices continued to fall.</p>
<h3>Wool Import Quota Too Small - Wool Industry Requests Relaxation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Woolen Textile Industry Association of this city recently stated that the Management Committee has allocated a quota for wool, wool tops, and woolen yarns for February to April of this year totaling only US$1.4 million. At most, this would only allow for the import of 1.2 million pounds of raw wool, or 900,000 pounds of wool tops, which is less than 20% of the industry's needs. Therefore, the industry is feeling panicked about a potential shortage of raw materials. It is reported that the industry (excluding state-owned and foreign-owned wool textile mills) uses over 700,000 pounds of wool tops per month and over 530,000 pounds of raw wool per year. If the limited quota is allocated for imported raw materials, each factory will only be able to operate for an average of five days per month, resulting in unacceptable losses. Moreover, current stocks can only meet the industry’s needs for half a month. Therefore, the association sent a letter to the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation Control Board last Saturday, urging them to relax the quota.</p>
<h3>The Starving World - Prospects for International Grain Coordination</h3>
<p>—Special Translation from Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>Although the world supply of major grains for 1946 is greater than in the previous year, many parts of Europe and Asia will inevitably suffer a hungry winter and an even hungrier spring.</p>
<p>With the relaxation of international grain controls and the stagnation of world relief agencies, competition among countries for grain will intensify. In this situation, grain is bound to flow to places with the strongest purchasing power. The United States is currently a major producer and may soon become a major customer for imported grain.</p>
<p>What the United Nations authorities are concerned about is that the United States may dismantle the international grain control pillars managed by the International Emergency Food Committee. The United States' refusal to extend the life of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) clearly indicates its preference for individual national actions over international action for relief work. Therefore, the UNRRA's European operations ended at the end of last December, and its operations in China will end at the end of March this year. Since the United States is not participating in international grain controls, the International Emergency Food Committee will also have to close its doors.</p>
<p>The future course of the United States depends on changes in current import controls. The Export Control Act will be abolished at the end of June this year. With the expiration of the Second War Powers Act, the import licensing system will automatically end at the end of March this year. Mr. Fee, Secretary-General of the International Emergency Food Committee, argues that the United States' import and export controls should be extended. However, it is feared that neither of these controls will continue, and the import control law may be abolished even before the end of March. As a result, American importers will be allowed to scavenge for fats, oils, and other foods that are in short supply. At the same time, because the United States has stronger purchasing power, it will certainly defeat other countries that are in greater need in competitive bidding. On the other hand, the end of export controls will cause fierce competition between American consumers and countries with US dollars for American goods. In short, the end of the United States' import and export controls will completely overturn the international distribution plan for scarce food. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Communist Troops in Shandong - Airmail News from Jinan on the 21st</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Li Tian of this newspaper</p>
<p>From March 1939 to July 1942, the Chinese Communist military in Shandong was under the unified command of Xu Xiangqian. In August 1942, the Chinese Communist Party formally established the Shandong Military Region, with Luo Ronghuan as the commander. It included five military districts: Bohai, Binhai, Jiaodong, Luzhong, and Lunan. The area west of the Jinpu Railway was incorporated into the Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region under the jurisdiction of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region. At this time, the Shandong Communists still followed the basic policy of "70% development, 20% coping, and 10% resisting Japan," attacking National Revolutionary Army troops and expanding their forces everywhere. By the eve of victory, they had expanded to 250,000 troops. After the Japanese surrendered, in order to seize the surrender and expand the liberated areas, the Communist Party transferred cadres and local troops from various detachments and local teams in Shandong to gradually expand and reorganize them into regular troops such as the Liberation Division, the New Division, the Garrison Brigade, and the Independent Brigade. The Shandong Military Region was also renamed the Frontline Army, still under the command of Luo Ronghuan, and divided into five routes to harass the entire province of Shandong. In November 1945, the Frontline Army was renamed the Field Army. At the same time, all seven divisions of the New Fourth Army south of the Longhai Railway, except for the Fifth Division, were transferred north to Shandong. For the sake of unified command, Chen Yi, commander of the New Fourth Army, was also appointed commander of the Shandong Field Army, and Luo Ronghuan's and Xu Xiangqian's 115th Division, as well as Yang Guofu's troops from the Bohai Military Region, were transferred to the Northeast. (more than 100,000 troops). According to investigations at the end of January this year, the number of Communist troops in Shandong is as follows:</p>

<p>2. Bohai Military Region (Commander: Yuan Ye Lie, with six sub-military regions, stationed with 39,400 regular troops)</p>
<p>3. Binhai Military Region (Commander: Chi Yaodong, with three sub-military regions, stationed with 70,000 regular troops)</p>
<p>4. Lunan Military Region (Commander: Zhang Guangzhong, with four sub-military regions, stationed with 100,000 regular troops)</p>
<p>5. Luzhong Military Region (Commander: Wang Jian'an, with four sub-military regions, stationed with 110,000 regular troops)</p>

<p>6. Lu-Yu Military Region (mainly in the western part of Shandong west of the Jinpu Line, Commander: Zhu Renqiong, with eight sub-military regions, stationed with 60,000 regular troops) (The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army Region also has jurisdiction over the Taihang Military Region, Jinan Military Region, etc., which are not included in this article.)</p>
<p>Casualty Estimates</p>
<p>Of the Communist regular troops listed above, excluding the 89,400 troops in the Jiaodong and Bohai military regions, the remaining 340,000 troops have been engaged in fierce battles for more than a month. According to reliable estimates, casualties should be at least one-third or more. Judging by the fact that the Communist army's attempt to attack Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu failed, forcing them to abandon their largest base in East China, Linyi, for nearly a week, and that there has been no other significant activity, it is not difficult to imagine the extent of the damage they have suffered and the urgent need for a considerable amount of time to reorganize and redeploy in order to attempt a comeback. The frequent sailing between Lushun, Dalian and Yantai, as well as the discovery of 20,000 to 30,000 troops transferred from the Jin-Ji-Cha border area in the Tai'an area, indicate that another major battle that can truly determine the overall situation in Shandong is brewing rapidly and will soon accelerate.</p>
<h3>After the Domestic Financial Tsunami, Hong Kong Floating Capital is Eager to Try</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong, 21st (Airmail) Special Correspondent Zi Jian of this newspaper</p>
<p>After the financial crisis in the mainland, Hong Kong, standing outside the national border, has shifted from "outward tension and inward relaxation" to "outward relaxation and inward tension" in recent days. In other words, when the value of the legal tender plummeted, the Hong Kong dollar remained unchanged. Although the residents of Hong Kong and China could not help but be "shocked" by the turmoil in the mainland, people in the financial sector, because they could not grasp the next move of our government, had to stand by and watch. When our highest authorities promulgated the new economic plan, the situation in Hong Kong and China changed from stillness to movement. The most important phenomenon is the "eagerness to try" of a large amount of floating capital from the mainland in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>The Stock Market Lacks Sustained Momentum - Absorbing Foreign Exchange Lacks Real Industry</h3>
<p>The flight of domestic floating capital to Hong Kong has long been rumored, but after that floating capital arrived in Hong Kong, in addition to generating more than 30 new Chinese-funded banks, there has been no major activity. The stock market once prospered, but then lacked sustained momentum. Domestic floating capital is cautious and dare not try lightly. The greatest ambition of the banks is to rely on the convenience of a dozen aspects in the mainland (such as the postal savings bureau and the export of mineral products by the Economic Resources Committee) to absorb a portion of foreign exchange in preparation for future development of domestic industries. Their work at this stage is to maintain credit as a matter of urgency, so everyone dares not rashly speculate for profit, which is completely different from the policies adopted by domestic banks.</p>
<h3>Absorbing Mexican Gold - Forming a Gold Transshipment Station</h3>
<p>Part of the domestic floating capital was used to purchase Mexican gold, which was transshipped to the mainland via Hong Kong for profit. As a result of their activities, Hong Kong has become an invisible gold transshipment station. In January alone, the import value was HK$29,364,297 and the export value was HK$22,857,758. Most of the exported gold was smuggled to the mainland via Macau. According to sources: two or three weeks ago, 40 billion yuan of floating capital from Central China arrived in Guangzhou to purchase gold. If our government can effectively prohibit the sale of gold, the role of domestic floating capital in Hong Kong's gold business will disappear (the price of gold in Hong Kong has fallen from HK$305 per tael to HK$289), and vice versa. If the ban is ineffective, the effectiveness of Hong Kong as a gold transshipment station will become more and more pronounced, and the smuggling of gold to the mainland via Hong Kong will inevitably increase. (The price of gold once fell to HK$272 and then rebounded).</p>
<h3>Value of Legal Tender Abnormally Increased</h3>
<p>Due to the large-scale purchase of gold by Guangzhou capital during the major fluctuations, and the government's order to ban the sale of gold, in recent days, some "gold owners" in Guangzhou have had to "carry" gold or foreign currency to Hong Kong to exchange for legal tender in order to cope with the shortage of chips. The value of the legal tender in Hong Kong has abnormally increased, with every 10,000 yuan exchangeable for HK$5.20. According to the Central Bank's quoted price, every 10,000 yuan should only be worth about HK$3.30. As a result, foreign goods exported from Hong Kong to Guangzhou and the mainland are more crowded than before, and the crisis of our country's import surplus is becoming more and more serious.</p>
<h3>Smuggled Goods Imported to Guangzhou - Silver in Guangdong Province Searched Out</h3>
<p>Foreign goods imported from Hong Kong to Guangzhou are now almost entirely handled by smugglers. Hong Kong is therefore also known as the smuggling center of South China. Smugglers are divided into large and small shareholders, and have established a complete transportation network. They import foreign goods and gold, and export some minerals (with tungsten accounting for the largest proportion) and silver. This is a big loophole, and some precious foreign exchange has escaped through this loophole. In the silver item alone, according to the statistics of the Hong Kong Import and Export Department, the exports through Hong Kong last year (mostly to the United Kingdom and India) included: silver bars worth 20,541,652 yuan, silver dollars worth 1,981,554 yuan, and silver auxiliary coins worth 8,446,513 yuan, totaling more than 30 million yuan (HKD). It is said that every 100 yuan of silver transported to Hong Kong can earn a profit of 18 yuan. After a large number of purchases by smugglers, there are probably very few remaining of civilian silver in Guangdong!</p>
<p>Another foreign exchange loophole is overseas remittances. At the end of last year, Rogers, the British advisor to Pei Tsu-I's Ministry of Finance, came to Hong Kong to spend Christmas, and it is said that he was discussing the issue of controlling overseas remittances with the Hong Kong government. After overseas remittances arrived in Hong Kong, they were transferred back to the United States, because merchants purchased them as payment for US goods. The more overseas remittances come to Hong Kong, the more US goods are shipped to Hong Kong (merchants who have overseas remittances can get rid of the restrictions on applying for US dollars from the Hong Kong government), which is not of any benefit to the UK. However, Pei Tsu-I returned after ten days in Hong Kong without success. In December last year, the total amount of overseas remittances handled by the Bank of China was 3,678,487,442 yuan in legal tender, a decrease of 1,024,622,573 yuan compared with November, nearly one-third. The figures for January this year have not yet been announced, but judging from the situation of overseas remittances fleeing to Hong Kong, the figures of the Bank of China are believed to be even smaller.</p>
<h3>Property Transactions Suddenly Booming</h3>
<p>The development of smuggling and overseas remittances has increased the floating capital in Hong Kong, but it is not the target of floating capital activities. Now that floating capital is increasing and urgently seeking activity targets, the real estate and housing business in Hong Kong has recently become a new target. Especially the wealthy people who came south from Shanghai, they would rather pay a large amount of "shoe money" to find a house than simply buy one or two. In the past month, housing transactions have suddenly become booming. Seeing this, Hong Kong plans to auction off some public land, among which the triangular area on the side of HSBC Bank and the intersection of Des Voeux Road and Queen's Road is the most interesting. The triangular area is about 10,000 square feet. It is said that the Hong Kong government quoted a price of HK$200 per square foot. Now someone is willing to pay HK$300. When it is publicly bid in the future, the value may be even greater.</p>
<h3>Part of the Floating Capital Turns to Hoarding Goods</h3>
<p>The concentration of a large amount of floating capital in Hong Kong is not only harmful to the mainland, but also to Hong Kong. Now it seems that part of the floating capital is turning to hoarding goods, and its signs have been seen in printing paper and rice. The price of rice in Hong Kong has soared for months, from 80 cents per catty to HK$1.20 per catty. Some salaried people are complaining endlessly. The labor unrest that has subsided for half a year is rising again!</p>
<h3>Ancient Capital Chang'an - Old Dreams Difficult to Find - Antique Industry Falls into Decline</h3>
<p>— Xi'an, 18th (Airmail) Special Correspondent Zhang Zhou of this newspaper</p>
<p>Xi'an is a city full of historical flavor. From the bell tower in the center of the city, the majestic city gates, the ancient Wild Goose Pagoda Temple, the Stele Forest…… you can't help but produce "the melancholy of remembering the past" and "the search for an old dream". But now, the reality of difficult life has shattered the glorious dream.</p>
<p>Apart from a few large buildings, the antique shops around Nan Yuan Men can be said to show ancient style. In one or two shops, paintings, stationery, ancient tripods, stone carvings, Qin bricks, Han tiles…… are displayed. No matter what their actual quality is, the owners will always tell a lot of history, and cite classics to prove that what they say is very true. In their language, they repeatedly say "Afang, Weiyang, Sui Dynasty, Tang Dynasty"…… and other ancient luxurious records to increase the value of antiques.</p>
<p>The types of antiques are very complicated, with many dazzling items. The usual ones are ceramics, calligraphy and painting, clothing, carved furniture, bamboo carvings, stone carvings, stone sculptures, clay sculptures, rubbings of famous steles, old books, ancient mirrors, ancient coins, military weapons…… and ancient utensils. The sources of these things are about three types: (1) Those unearthed in Shaanxi and Gansu are indeed antiques, but this now probably only accounts for one or two tenths, because if they are famous objects, they have already been sold. Except for the aristocratic families in Xi'an, or some who have preserved them, they are almost invisible on the market. (2) They are counterfeits. For example, things from the Ming and Qing dynasties are used as relics of the Han and Tang dynasties, and so on. Especially stone carvings, pottery and clay sculptures, the original pieces do not have the year or author written on them, so they can be mixed up. It is not easy to identify them unless you are experienced in this business. (3) They are fake. Today's antiques in Xi'an have fakes of all kinds. Some of them are made very lifelike, and some are crude. However, these manufacturers write the names of Shen Zhou, Yun Nantian, Banqiao, Qiu Ying…… on their masterpieces. From this, you can see that the nature of merchants has already invaded the elegant forest.</p>
<p>The people of "Old Chang'an" say that famous items here are mostly stored in the homes of aristocratic families. In the antique exhibition three or four years ago, there were many treasures, such as Zhao Ziang's "Peach Blossom Spring" and "Junma", Xia Gui's horizontal scroll reached several feet, and Li Longmian's line drawing of Buddhist temples, Qiu Ying's figures, Ni Zan's landscapes, and the characters of Yue Fei, Wen Tianxiang, Yang Jisheng, and Dong Qichang were also not a few, but those before the Sui and Tang dynasties were still extremely rare. According to people, there are not many great collectors in Xi'an. Generally speaking, the collections of the Liang Wuqiao and Yan Ganyuan families should be quite impressive. But for the most part, they are still scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>The golden age of the antique market in recent decades was in the early years of the Republic of China, when large quantities went to Shanghai and other places in the southeast. Until about the 20s of the Republic of China, it was still considered not to be declining. After the "January 28th Incident," it was slightly worse than before, and after the "July 7th Incident," the coastal areas fell one after another. The new era needed new things, so it was not as good as before in the midst of constant war. In 1945, after the American soldiers came to Xi'an, the market became active again. Those foreigners felt novel about everything in the ancient city of Chang'an, and bought a lot of these antiques. The neglected market became active again. It was as green as the "ancient clothing" industry, but after the Allies left, it also became deserted.</p>
<p>Under the raging inflation, merchants have mostly felt that it is not easy to maintain. The price of grain in Xi'an is still a headache. Within two months, it has tripled. As of now, although gold has no market (private) due to the prohibition of trading, flour has risen from 47,000 to 58,000 yuan (per bag). And department stores have also increased by more than 80% within half a month. As a result, anyone from civil servants to businessmen felt very panic about their livelihood. Antique dealers in the present day, needless to say, also felt more "different than before".</p>

<p>The Bizarre Drama of Depriving the Freedom to Read Newspapers</p>
<p>Editor: Please note that elements threatened by certain disruptive forces have invaded our school to interfere with our freedom to read newspapers. They believe that any newspaper that stands for national construction and order is not to their liking. They lavishly scold and obstruct people who read newspapers, and even interfere with them. They simply deprive people of the freedom to read newspapers. In our school, a certain society was attacked for posting a certain newspaper, and the student union was asked to interfere, prevent posting, and say that if they wanted to post a newspaper, they were limited to posting a certain newspaper or a certain newspaper, otherwise, the student union would announce the names of the people posting the newspaper.</p>
<p>In the past, they also shouted slogans of "democracy" and "freedom," but they did not give others "freedom." They tried to erase the public opinion of the masses with the absurd views of a few people. This matter is similar to the freedom and democracy in the so-called "liberated areas." I hate such "freedom" and "democracy" and understand the true meaning of their advocacy for parties to withdraw from schools. Now our school is busy with this kind of activity, which has created a very chaotic situation. They advocate that students should not focus on studying and make political sacrifices in vain. Please pay attention to cleaning up the Education Bureau! (Li Yichu)</p>
<p>How to Refund Life Insurance Premiums</p>
<p>Editor: In May 1941, I was introduced by a friend to a life insurance company and purchased life insurance of 5,000 yuan in legal tender, payable in five years, with an annual payment of 211.60 yuan. I paid legal tender for two years and counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes for one year, calculated at a rate of two for one. Because Shanghai was not safe, I returned to my hometown and interrupted the payment. After the victory, I came to Shanghai and worked. I went to the company to inquire about how to handle this insurance. The company replied that it should still be paid according to the original amount. I replied that the current value of the currency is too low and I am unwilling to pay 211.60 yuan for savings. He said that the industry association has not yet had a specific plan and is waiting for government orders. There has been no reply so far. I think the value of the 600 yuan of legal tender I paid at that time was enough to sell a dan of white rice for only 20 or 30 yuan in legal tender. Please ask the company to decide on a proper method of refunding the principal as soon as possible to avoid policyholders suffering too much! (Ding Wencai)</p>
<p>Handle Dangerous Buildings as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Editor: Yesterday, I happened to see many buildings on Yangshupu Road, numbers 1411 to 1449 and 1667 to 1673, in the Eighth Route Army newspaper. They are all dilapidated buildings that have been tilted and are extremely dangerous. Residents may not be aware of it yet. If an accident occurs, the lives and property of residents and passers-by will be damaged beyond imagination. The reader cannot remain silent in the face of danger, so I specially wrote a letter to warn them and urge homeowners and residents to pay close attention and deal with it as soon as possible to avoid disaster.

<h3>Mountain Depths, Waterfall Valleys, Spraying Foam: Prospects for Fujian Hydropower</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Fuzhou on the 15th, Special Correspondent Chen Zheng Yu of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Lacking Production, Lacking Misery</p>
<p>Production and construction require substantial capital, cutting-edge technology, abundant resources, inexpensive labor, and convenient transportation. Fujian's economic construction has traditionally been hindered by the province's financial difficulties, transportation obstacles, and a lack of industrial raw materials, preventing significant achievements. In terms of production technology, it remains stuck in a medieval production stage, adhering rigidly to outdated methods. For example, Fujian's tea, sugar, and paper manufacturing industries once flourished in Southeast Asia and Europe before the war. It is a pity that improvements in production technology have not been possible, otherwise they could have gained an advantage in the international marketplace. The weakness of Fujian's economic productivity also stems from a fundamental reason: Fujian is a province lacking coal. Without a power source for industry, how can motors be started? Fujian's local economy has been stifled by a lack of electricity, and the more than thirteen million people in Fujian Province are impoverished due to the lack of power-driven industries.</p>
<p>Taking Fuzhou as an example: the entire Fuzhou power plant generates only 3,500 kilowatts, and its fuel is wood, which is uneconomical. Furthermore, this 3,500 kilowatts of power is not only insufficient to meet the needs of some light industries in Fuzhou, but also the power for residential lighting throughout Fuzhou can only be maintained by not supplying electricity during the day. Outside of Fuzhou, only the counties and cities of Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Nanping, Jian'ou, Gutian, Yong'an, and Shaxian in Fujian Province have small power plants to supply citizens with meager electricity. How eagerly the people of Fujian long for the day when the entire region achieves electrification, using cheap electricity as the power source for various productions to improve their standard of living.</p>
<p>Generating Hydropower with Waterfalls</p>
<p>Utilizing nature is where human intelligence lies. Since Fujian lacks coal, then utilizing the steep, cascading water flow to generate electricity is the most economical method. According to investigations by the Fujian Provincial Construction Committee: the Jinjiang River basin in Anxi County can generate 100,000 horsepower; the Jiulongjiang River basin in Hua'an County can generate significant hydropower, but detailed surveys are still underway; the Gutian Creek hydropower, primarily using the Longting Waterfall in Gutian County, can yield 80,000 horsepower; and Jiulihu Lake in Xianyou County can generate 10,000 horsepower. Overall, these four locations can provide more than 300,000 horsepower. If fully developed to meet the needs of civil electricity in all counties throughout the province, and to supply the province's future economic development and the use of southeastern provinces, it would be more than sufficient.</p>
<p>The electricity generated by Jiulihu Lake in Xianyou can be used for salt electrolysis plants, ice factories, sugar factories, canning factories, fresh fruit and vegetable refrigeration plants, and water plants in the coastal counties of southern Fujian. In addition to supplying pulp mills and sawmills near Gutian, the electricity generated by Longting can also transmit a large amount of power to the urban area of Fuzhou and its vicinity to supply electricity to various factories near Fuzhou. It is estimated that after the power of the factories is increased, the productivity can be doubled.</p>
<p>The hydropower development of Gutian Creek is most valuable, which is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Building Dams on Gutian Creek</p>
<p>Gutian Creek possesses tremendous potential hydropower. Its upstream east and west tributaries originate in Pingnan County, winding for more than fifty miles before converging east of Gutian County. The water flow gradually increases, and the Gutian Electric Power Company diversion dam at Guisei, two kilometers south of the county seat, intercepts the river basin. Therefore, the water flow is smooth. Below Guisei, beaches are lined up in the valleys, and rocks are fully exposed. Flowing eleven kilometers to Caoyang Village, it joins the Caoyang West Creek. At this point, the riverbed becomes slightly flatter, and the mountains on both banks are steep. Flowing three kilometers south is the famous Longting Waterfall, cascading down a cliff thirteen meters high, with spraying foam, forming a spectacle. Below the waterfall, the riverbed becomes narrower, and the water and rocks collide, rushing down. Flowing ten kilometers to Lijiaqi, the remaining force is exhausted. After another eight kilometers, at Boping, the water flow becomes stable, and after five kilometers, it merges into the Min River at Shuikou. The entire creek's shoals and waterfalls are concentrated in the section from Guisei to Lijiaqi, a creek length of twenty-four kilometers with a drop of more than 230 meters, making it an excellent location for hydropower development on Gutian Creek.</p>
<p>Gutian Creek is close to Fuzhou, accessible via the Baifu Gutian Highway, which is 135 kilometers long. Water transportation on the Min River to Gukou and Shuikou can also connect with Gutian, making transportation conditions very favorable.</p>
<p>The Entire Project is Divided into Three Stages</p>
<p>After the Provincial Construction Committee and the Water Resources Committee of the Resources Commission dispatched engineers Xu and Lin to conduct on-site surveys, it was determined that, given the current conditions and the power demand in eastern Fujian, the hydropower development of Gutian Creek could be developed in phases. The entire project is divided into three stages:</p>
<p>Stage 1: Utilize the drop in the curved riverbed between Guichao and Bankengting, building a dam one kilometer below the original power plant site at Guisei. The mountains on both banks are steep at this location, and the riverbed is narrow, with rocks fully exposed, making it a good dam site. However, the dam body needs to be relatively high (fifteen meters). There may be potential dam sites within this one kilometer, but the left bank consists of alluvial farmland, and the riverbed is filled with loose rocks, making it difficult to find a solid dam site. On the right bank of the river, a tunnel could be built through Tasha Mountain to the valley of Fengpei Pavilion, 1.5 kilometers long, using the valley to build a dam as a forebay and establish a plant at the exit of the valley, or drawing water through an open channel across this valley to establish a plant 200 meters below Bankengting, achieving a water head of 100 meters. The selection of either of these will be determined after topographic surveys.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Utilize the 50-meter drop between Longting and Anlin Village. The mountains on both banks from below Caoyang Village to Longting are steep, and the riverbanks are narrow, all being excellent dam sites. It is planned to build an increased dam above Longting Waterfall, which can shorten the water diversion channel, opening a channel along the mountain for more than two kilometers to establish a plant in Anlin Village. The terrain there is flat, suitable for plant construction. In addition, utilize the approximately 200 square kilometers of the Caoyang two-creek watershed, which merges into Gutian Creek one kilometer below Bankengting. One section of the valley at its outlet is deep, with several waterfalls. At Tingquan Pavilion, the waterfall has a drop of fifteen meters. If a dam is built above it and water is diverted to the creek mouth for power generation, a water head of 80 meters can be obtained. The upstream has a wide plain of about eight square kilometers, which can be used for salary water to increase the flow in the second and third stages.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Utilize the 80-meter drop in the riverbed bends from Yantou Ting to Lijiaqi. Build a dam at Yantou Ting, tunnel through the mountain ridge, and then open a channel along the mountain for 1.5 kilometers to establish a plant at Lijiaqi for power generation.</p>
<p>The above three stages of the project are very simple, and more than 80,000 horsepower of power can be obtained. It is easy to develop them in phases.</p>
<p>Five Organizations Cooperate</p>
<p>After the Provincial Construction Committee and the Resources Committee dispatched personnel to conduct on-site surveys of various hydropower locations, they will first develop the Gutian Creek area. However, the hydrological data of the creek is still lacking accurate and detailed records. A permanent hydrological station should be established in Gutian County to continue recording water levels and measuring flow rates. Other factors such as rainfall and evaporation should also be systematically observed in advance for future corrections and as a basis for future construction. As for the implementation of this project plan, it will be jointly undertaken by five organizations: the Fujian Provincial Government, the Resources Committee, Taiwan Power Company, Overseas Chinese Business Company, and Fujian Economic Construction Company. The Fujian Power Company Preparatory Committee will be organized to be responsible for the progress of the project. Taiwan Power Company will invest in the Fujian Power Company at a discounted price with its hydropower generators and their generating accessories from power plants that were discontinued due to surplus power on the east coast of Taiwan Province. The other civil engineering equipment will be jointly shared by the Overseas Chinese Enterprise Company, Fujian Economic Construction Company, and the Fujian Provincial Government. The Resources Committee will be responsible for the technical design work.</p>
<p>This hydropower project, with the cooperation of the Resources Committee on the technical aspects, Taiwan Power Company on the mechanical equipment aspects, and the Overseas Chinese Company on the financial aspects, will be completed in phases soon.</p>
<p>What Fujian lacks most is railway transportation and power-driven industries. With railways, Fujian's special products can be sold throughout the country, preventing the existing industries from being stifled. With power-driven industries, the revitalization of new industries in Fujian can be stimulated. Both have a decisive impact on the development of Fujian's local economy. The Min-Gan Railway has been initiated by Fujianese Chen Ti Rong and others in Shanghai, who have organized the "Fujian Railway Company" and are negotiating with several Canadian manufacturers for large loans guaranteed by the Executive Yuan. It is expected that once the Canadian equipment arrives, construction will be decisively undertaken. The Fujian Electric Power Co., Ltd. hopes to complete a section of the water measurement project as soon as possible to inspire the people of Fujian. The folk customs of Fujian are simple and hardworking, and the general people's lives are very frugal. How should the provincial government strive to paint a magnificent vision to comfort the people who toil year-round!</p>

<h3>On the Jiaoji Railway, Homecomings are Busy</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Qingdao on the 20th, Hou Shi</p>
<p>The Jiaoji Railway, the major artery of Shandong, after being hastily repaired by road workers, has been repeatedly damaged by the Communist army shortly after being connected. The incident occurred between Nanquan and Lancun, and another at a location near Jiaodong Station, where more than twenty sections of track and six holes of the iron bridge were damaged, causing the train service to be stranded again. The railway bureau is currently dispatching vehicles to repair the damage.</p>
<p>Before six o'clock in the morning, the station was already crowded with passengers, all of whom had left their homes and been refugees in Qingdao for a long time. Once they heard that the Jiaoji Railway was open, they all wanted to return home as soon as possible. The waiting room was noisy and crowded, with almost no room to stand.</p>
<p>In order to entertain the visiting delegation of reporters, the railway bureau specially attached a public affairs car. In front of the locomotive, the Party and national flags were crossed, fluttering in the wind, symbolizing the joyful mood of the people in the carriages. At 7:40, the car slowly started and headed west. When the car arrived at the first major station, Dagang, because there were too many passengers without tickets, the order was disrupted, and it had to return to Qingdao. Military police and railway police boarded the car and re-checked the tickets once, persuading the passengers without tickets and asking them to get off. As a result, the order in the car was better, but the departure time was delayed by more than an hour.</p>
<p>The car traveled very fast, passed Jiaoxian without stopping, and drove straight to Gaomi. Gaomi is an important location in eastern Shandong, connecting southern and northern Shandong. The station was originally a magnificent building, but now it has been destroyed, and only the remains of the water tower are left. Looking around, there are only broken walls and ruins, a very desolate scene. When the car passed Taibaozhuang, which was the location where the connection ceremony was held a few days ago, the speed became very slow, and the carriages shook violently. This location, because it is a curved area of the entire Jiaoji line with prominent terrain, the track has been most severely damaged, and the repair is also very difficult.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived at Fangzi, it was late, and the car stopped here overnight. The situation in Fangzi is very good because the Communist army has never come. The next morning, the car continued to drive to Weixian. Weixian is a large station on the Jiaoji line, second only to Qingdao and Jinan, with a population of 120,000. Most of the pig bristles and hair nets exported from Shandong Province are shipped from Weixian. Because of the inconvenience of road transportation, the commerce in Weixian is also depressed, and the people's lives are poor. People with a little property have gone to Qingdao or other ports. Now that the railway is open, there will definitely be more people returning home one after another.</p>
<p>The restoration of transportation not only facilitates freight transport but also has an impact on thinning out the population and alleviating the housing shortage. For example, the population of Qingdao, according to figures released by the police bureau, the total number of Chinese and foreign households in November was 152,777, with a population of 752,258, including 1,753 foreigners. Recently, due to the convenience of transportation compared to before, the number of people returning home has been increasing, resulting in a decrease of 111 households and 3,830 people compared to last month, and a decrease of 23 foreigners. Now that the Jiaoji Railway is open, the number of people returning home will gradually increase, so the population of Qingdao may continue to decrease. Naturally, this still depends on how the current situation develops.</p>

<h3>Insurance</h3>
<p>— By French writer B. Gervaise, translated by Li Qingai</p>
<p>As La Fleuve walked out of the prison gates, he could not help being startled, because his former boss, Luc Jerville, was standing right across from him. This Luc Jerville was the one who had previously put him in prison for eighteen months.</p>
<p>"Good morning, La Fleuve," the man said crisply. "You probably weren't waiting here, were you? ... I knew they were releasing you this morning, I had already received a report."</p>
<p>"What do you want from me?" La Fleuve asked unhappily.</p>
<p>"I've come to propose something to you," Luc Jerville said, "Would you be willing to return to my store?"</p>
<p>The released man shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Go back to a crook's store!" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, you made some mistakes before, did some... abnormal things, but any sin can be forgiven! ... And I hope that what happened to you will teach you a lesson in the future, so now we don't need to talk about it anymore. If you are willing to return to the store and do the same work as before with the same treatment, then just come to the store at the usual time next Monday, and I will wait for you."</p>
<p>La Fleuve thought for a while, then made up his mind:</p>
<p>"Agreed!" he said, "See you Monday!"</p>
<p>There is certainly much to be said about the mental effects of prison, but no one can deny that some people have gained a certain sense of dignity in there. So La Fleuve could not help but feel that he was demeaning himself when he showed even the slightest hint of gratitude to this ruthless boss, who, for some unfortunate minor mistakes, had ignored all his pleadings and tears and sent him to court. So accepting his request now was already a matter of consideration.</p>
<p>"I had no choice," he said to himself in a self-pitying tone. "Because with the references I can provide now, it won't be that easy to find a position as an accountant and cashier."</p>
<p>Moreover, he decided not to forgive any hurtful allusions, any allusive words, whether these things came from Luc Jerville in the future, or from old colleagues he would meet again in the future. But all of this made him more resourceful and careful. They all greeted him with sympathy, without showing the slightest surprise, as if La Fleuve's return to the store was the most natural thing in the world. As for the boss, his taste was also high, and he did not reveal the kind of embarrassing arrogance that belonged to a meritorious benefactor.</p>
<p>"Good morning, La Fleuve," he said simply, "You know what you should do, I don't need to tell you, do I? If you need any explanation about everything that happened during your absence, then please feel free to ask me."</p>
<p>La Fleuve thanked him in a worldly manner and then started working. He concentrated on his work because the format of all the books was very neglected.</p>
<p>"Three accountants have been hired to replace you, but none of them could handle it," the old worker who served in the office, Walker Duff, told him. "They used to say that there was too much work for one person to do, so they asked for an assistant, but the boss never agreed to them, you can understand! ... 'Your predecessor used to handle it all very well,' the boss replied to them."</p>
<p>Later, he added this disloyal sentence:</p>
<p>"No doubt that's why he hired you again!"</p>
<p>Needless to say! Yes, La Fleuve handled it all very well, but for doing so, he had his own supreme reason: when others carefully forged the entrusted bookkeeping, then rather than bearing a colleague who was sensitive to discovering secrets, it was better to do it strictly and uprightly. Therefore, a disloyal accountant is often willing to work harder than an upright and selfless employee. Similarly, he usually pays more attention to the boss's interests. His business prosperity is important to him because one can only move money around at will in a very full treasury. These are all things that should be clearly reported when a cheater hands over the books before the court! Then there is only to explain this to the judges!</p>
<p>Now, seeing all this work weighing on his shoulders, La Fleuve did not complain at all. Because he had rediscovered all his habits, his desk, his chair, his various books, and all the scattered appendages in the office that had been with him for so long: such as ink bottles, blotting paper pads, date stamps, finger-moistening sponges, and perennially dry glue bottles, he felt happy!</p>
<p>But the thing he considered to be the happiest was the tranquility he enjoyed in this store. Originally, when he first sat down in his old seat, he had feared that his life would fall into an embarrassing atmosphere of suspicion, under the incessant scrutiny of a boss who had become distrustful because of past memories. Being regarded as a suspicious person, La Fleuve could not long bear such a grievance. But nothing of this kind happened. Luc Jerville treated him as an employee correctly and as before. He never audited his accounts, never revealed a hint of suspicion in his words. As before, he handed him the key to the safe and allowed him to handle deposits of considerable amounts. So much trust finally touched La Fleuve's heart.</p>
<p>"He really is a beautiful character, I never thought he had such strength!" he muttered to himself when his boss was away.</p>
<p>He therefore used double the fairness and diligence to show his gratitude, desperately making up for the delays caused by the colleagues who had taken over his duties. Sometimes, he found himself obstructed by some unexpected difficulties. In that general ledger, many new accounts had been opened when he left, resulting in many small riddles that made La Fleuve want to figure it out on his own without asking anyone.</p>
<p>One of these new tricks especially puzzled him. This expense was listed in the general expenses, the amount was three thousand francs, and the account was called this strange name: "Compensation Society". What could this Compensation Society be? What had this strange-named expert sold to Luc Jerville's store for a price of three thousand francs? ... Of course, there was a very simple way to find out the bottom line: to ask Mr. Luc Jerville himself, but La Fleuve's self-esteem came into play. He considered this topic a personal matter, so he thought that asking someone to help him was to admit his own incompetence. So he decided to find the answer on the condition that he would not be assisted by anyone. He spent more than ten efforts in succession to review various delivery orders, various pickup orders, various receipts, and all suspicious documents that led him on the path. However, in vain! Even though he had exhausted all his inquiries, the mystery of the Compensation Society still had not revealed a single point.</p>
<p>At this time, Luc Jerville seemed to be concentrating on making La Fleuve's good reviews obtained from him step by step. Never had a boss been so generous in trusting the honesty of his accountant and cashier. La Fleuve was therefore greatly moved.</p>
<p>"How could I have thought of imposing theft on such a person!" he thought in his heart.</p>
<p>But he had not yet reached the end of his tearful gratitude.</p>
<p>"I have to go away for a few days," Luc Jerville said to him one morning, "Here are a few blank checks. You can fill in the amount and take the money to the bank as needed."</p>
<p>Faced with this new evidence of credit, La Fleuve already felt his tears welling up in his eyes. At this time, the boss went on to say:</p>
<p>"You should pay the fee for the Compensation Society, the receipt should be sent over in these few days."</p>
<p>La Fleuve seized the opportunity and asked, "I was just wondering, what exactly is this Compensation Society?"</p>
<p>"What! You don't know!" Luc Jerville exclaimed. "It's an insurance company."</p>
<p>"Then, you are not insured with the Mutual Aid Society?" the surprised accountant said.</p>
<p>Then Luc Jerville simply said, "Who said I'm not, but the Mutual Aid Society only 'does' fire insurance, which is not enough ... you can understand, I also insured against theft, now."</p>
<p>Shocked and embarrassed, La Fleuve left this store that evening, a store where someone had used good feelings to deceive him. This was still one of the many things that a person trained under the harsh training of prison could not tolerate.</p>
<p>Qing Ai notes: B. Gervaise is a modern French writer whose life story is yet to be investigated. In addition to this piece, I have recently seen a short story called "Floating Mask", whose language is as clear and beautiful as this piece, whose psychological analysis is as rich as this piece, and whose attention to structure and revelation of "unknown points" at the end of the piece to arouse the reader's interest is also the same as this piece. It can be said that his style is very similar to that of Vercors, the author of "The Silence of the Sea". Perhaps this is a new trend in French novels and short stories after this World War. The original text of this piece appeared in the French "Chinese Post Weekly" on February 9 of this year and was probably reprinted from a publication in Paris. Finished translating and recording at the North Pole Pavilion on February 15.</p>
<h3>Commentary on Paintings and Calligraphy from the Lingxi Garden</h3>
<p>— Orchard</p>
<p>Among paintings and calligraphy, figures and fish are both favored by the world, but it is not easy to reach the extreme. The Lingxi Garden has figure paintings by Xue Ji, "Three Yuan Circles" by Li Boshi, and paintings by Qiu Shizhou and Tang Liuru, all of which are elegant and luxurious, beyond the dreams of modern painters. As for the item of ten thousand fish, such as Gu Hutou's Yi Ge, and Song Huizong's White-Haired Belonging, are all excellent works. Taking the item of fish as an example, the fish of Wang Guang, the fish of Yan Yanzhi, and the fish of Li Boshi all show novelty and do not fall into common clichés. Careful examination reveals that they are all spirited and precious. I would like to share them with insightful people!</p>

<h3>World Famous Paintings Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Since Matteo Ricci brought Western paintings to China during the Ming Dynasty, there has been a lot of friction with Chinese painting. However, at that time, it was entirely for the purpose of demonstration, and painting was merely an appendage of religion. Therefore, the Chinese art world at that time was only slightly influenced in portrait painting, and other painting methods were not affected. It was not until the Italian painter Giuseppe Castiglione came to China in the early Qing Dynasty that the Chinese art world began to experience greater waves. Ultimately, Western painting methods and Chinese painting methods were found to be incompatible in many ways. Although Castiglione spared no effort to sacrifice pure Western methods and catered to Chinese methods, creating an eclectic school of painting, it was ultimately too meticulous and complex, not in line with the elegant and unrestrained Chinese taste, and therefore did not spread widely.</p>
<p>At the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, restrictions were greatly lifted, and Western paintings also crossed the sea to the East. As a result, Western painting styles surged and flourished, showing a tendency to overshadow the host and replace Chinese painting. However, due to national customs, habits, and various environmental and material conditions, Western painting, which was initially invincible, has made snail-like progress in the past twenty years. Today, with the rising cost of living and the difficulty in purchasing Western painting materials, Western painting is facing a rather serious crisis. How to break through this difficult situation and prevent Western painting in China from withering due to malnutrition is a matter of great deliberation.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of museums and art galleries in our country, the Chinese people do not have the opportunity to appreciate and observe Western paintings. Furthermore, due to crude printing and lack of publications, there are very few works introducing Western paintings in the country, leaving those who aspire to study without a starting point. Moreover, most of the painters who have studied in Europe and the United States have changed careers due to environmental and living conditions, further dimming the Western art world.</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai Art College is holding a world-famous painting exhibition at the YMCA for the sake of student aid. The four paintings on display are all original-color prints from abroad, only second to genuine works. Moreover, according to the order of art history, from primitive cave paintings to the current Fauvism and Futurism, each era and each major artist has one or more representative masterpieces. This allows viewers to not only see the full picture of authentic Western paintings but also to read it as a history of painting. The evolution of Western painting can be said to be clear at a glance, making viewers feel as if they are in the great art galleries of Rome, Florence, and the Louvre, which is truly a great event!</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to Western paintings, there are also Chinese paintings arranged according to the era, from the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan Dynasties to the present day, with masterpieces by each major artist on display. This time, because Western painting is the main focus and Chinese painting is the secondary focus, the Chinese painting aspect is inevitably inferior.</p>
<p>As far as I know, such an exhibition is unprecedented in our country. Therefore, not only those who like Western paintings should go and see it, but also those who do not paint Chinese paintings or Western paintings should go and see it in order to broaden their horizons and understand the solemnity and greatness of the painting world, so as not to be frogs in a well or arrogant ignoramuses.</p>
<h3>A Hundred Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains, an Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 183</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The third step is to implement the mind probing technique. This step, although a helpless measure, is an adventure worth taking because the secret of "Eight" seems to be of great importance. To make the effect more certain, Liang Qun and W Qun also automatically joined. The method used was incremental hypnosis. This is slightly different from the original plan; its use still utilized Tsurumi as a medium, with Yao Qun as the first convener, W Jun as the second convener, and I was responsible for the aftermath. Tsurumi had two exchanges of minds with Pingzi, so in principle, these two experiments should not have any unexpected dangers.</p>
<p>After the above three steps were completed, there was still half a step left. This half-step was initiated by Xu Qun to explore the East Jiaomin Lane. I originally advocated postponing this step until the next day or evening, but Zong Qun, this Northeast young lady, had a rather impetuous temperament. Once she spoke of something, she had to do it in one step. Moreover, there was also that little tiger next to her, who had never been timid. We thought this move was quite risky, but she treated it like a game. After our repeated persuasion, she agreed to only scout around and not engage in combat; therefore, it only counts as half a step.</p>
<p>——The steps were planned properly, and it was already past seven o'clock. After a hasty dinner, everyone went their separate ways to prepare and arrange what was necessary. Just as Tsurumi and I had drafted and sent a few secret telegrams, "04" had rushed back. His report disappointed us greatly.</p>
<p>It turned out that when he left the city, the war in the suburbs had already come to an end; Commander Song's main force, although it preserved fifty to sixty percent of its strength, retreated to the Liangxiang and Zhuozhou areas in the south; however, the news of the deaths of two generals, Yuan Dengyu and Tong Linge, had been confirmed. The troops of both generals, and a part of General Zhang Zizhong's troops, were gradually consumed by the Japanese army's pincer formation, leaving very little. The Chinese garrison trapped in Beiping City rushed out of the small city, but were driven back; fortunately, the remnants of the army outside the city desperately built one or two lines of defense, echoing from inside and outside, and only then rescued most of the troops inside the city and fled westward in disarray.</p>
<p>"04" searched for Wu Dingyuan's whereabouts, but according to the enemy troops along the way, they had not seen a single civilian other than Chinese soldiers. Of course, Wu Dingyuan could not have flown to Changxindian, so in theory, "04" did not need to make this trip. But an order is an order, and it cannot be violated in the slightest. Moreover, the war was over, and the sound of gunfire along the way was sparse, so he arrived at Changxindian a little after five o'clock. There, he ran into mostly Japanese soldiers and some unsavory ruffians. A little after six o'clock, he returned to the city.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was still early, he happened to hear that the Japanese army had detained many Chinese people, kept separately in three or four locations. He immediately asked the several Japanese agents who went with him to search these confined places; as a result, he never found Engineer Wu's shadow. What he heard were two unfortunate bad news; one, Japanese planes were heavily bombing the suburbs of Tianjin, with Nankai University as the biggest target of the bombing. It was said that the school had been razed to the ground. Two, although General Li Wentian led his troops in Tianjin, vowing to resist the enemy to the death, the fate of Tianjin City was already in imminent danger. Furthermore, according to a secret message from Songbe Miyaka, a large fleet of Japanese warships, loaded with several regiments of marines, had sailed towards my Tianjin Dagukou, and would be able to land at Dagu from 12:00 p.m. onwards.</p>
<p>After listening to "04"'s reports, Tsurumi felt that the situation in Tianjin and Beiping was changing so rapidly that it was beyond expectations. Fearing that our planned assault would be hindered, he immediately ordered the car to be prepared, and told me to relay this news to W Jun. Before leaving, he kept nagging me like an old woman, repeatedly urging me to tell everyone that no matter how late it was, even if it affected our plan, they must wait for him to return before launching any expected actions. At this time, his composure was somewhat flustered.</p>

<h3>A Special Account of Washington's Birthday Ball</h3>
<p>— Feng Rui</p>
<p>The evening of February 22nd.</p>
<p>On Albert Road, Lafayette Road, the stars twinkled, and the evening wind was strong.</p>
<p>It was obviously somewhat different from the usual scene. The road, which was usually deserted, was particularly lively that day. Here, to quote a line from Li Houzhu's poem, "Carriages flow like water, horses roar like dragons," it can truly be said to be worthy of the description.</p>
<p>Eight hundred noble and elegantly dressed Chinese and American ladies and gentlemen were gradually swallowed up inside.</p>
<p>In terms of Chinese-American friendship, this was an extraordinary day. That day was Washington's birthday, and the Shanghai Returned Students Association from the United States and other four Chinese and American groups held a grand banquet ball for this occasion.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart delivered a fifteen-minute speech at the banquet ball. His calm and pertinent tone aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience. When he pointed out that China's only enemies were poverty, illiteracy, disease, and the abuse of public office for private gain, the whole audience held their breath, and it seemed that the sound of low sighs could be heard from everyone's heart.</p>
<p>Here, everyone seemed to be decades younger. They cheered to their heart's content and danced to their heart's content. Youth and joy occupied everyone's heart.</p>
<p>The ladies and gentlemen had all removed their light furs and put on the most fashionable new clothes: long skirts trailing on the ground, shimmering dance dresses, and bare chests and arms enjoying the gentleness. Music and spring. Although at this time, it was still the season of chilling spring weather outdoors, and heavy furs were not enough to withstand the cold; but in this garden, it was full of spring, and the dancing was in full swing. It had already crossed into another world, dancing carefree and carefree, in another paradise.</p>
<p>Of course, the situation that day was different from an ordinary gathering. The music was also frantically upbeat and unusually intense. The musicians, blowing and playing, were all flushed, playing all kinds of passionate notes that made people forget time and forget the world.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu has always been a dance enthusiast, but that night, because he was accompanying Ambassador Stuart, he did not go down to the floor at all. He only nodded and smiled to some familiar guests in the crowded dancing crowd. Perhaps it was because he had been sitting for too long that he began to yawn. Someone said, "The Mayor's dance addiction has flared up." The Mayor's wife seemed to be a little fatter than before, sitting between Ambassador Stuart and American Consul General Davis, further complementing a typical Oriental beauty.</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang also attended the grand event that night in his capacity as a "returned student from the United States." Wearing a gray suit, he had a friendly two-minute conversation with Ambassador Stuart in Beijing dialect.</p>
<p>If we didn't know that Mei Lanfang was a famous actor, who would believe that this nearly sixty-year-old man could still specialize in playing the delicate and charming appearance of a young girl on stage?</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang is good at using dignified gestures and delicate and thoughtful movements to greet every female partner, which seems to easily remind people: Is this still somewhat carrying the colors of the stage?</p>
<p>During the dance, in that huge dance floor, it eventually became too crowded because it could not accommodate the constant one or two hundred pairs of dance partners. Each pair of dance partners felt that it was difficult to move even an inch. On top of the dance floor, three large clusters of balloons hung high, becoming the focal point of everyone's attention.</p>
<p>When the balloons began to float down, the entire dance floor was in an uproar: everyone hoped to grab a few balloons, the ladies laughed softly, shouted softly, and stretched out their hands nimbly to tease them, and their dance partners shouted out encouraging cheers for them. That moment of chaos, laughter, mixed with the popping sound of balloons, formed a picture of "ladies playing with balls." The black man on the music stage smiled, only revealing two rows of snow-white teeth, flashing under the neon lights.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone raised their glasses again, said good night to each other, and stepped back onto the cold streets of Shanghai on a spring night. A series of cars gradually carried their masters back to the sweet dreams of spring.</p>
<p>At that time, it was already past twelve o'clock. On Albert Road, the stars filled the sky, still shining brightly. A gust of cool wind made people feel as cool as water.</p>
<p>(Recorded on February 23rd at Zunwen)</p>
<h3>The Nosy Person</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou Zhuren</p>
<p>Being nosy is a virtue because it is a manifestation of curiosity. However, when this virtue develops towards people and is very proactive, it will be "unbearable." I am a person who is greatly troubled by nosiness. Because I am not good at eloquence and cannot avoid nosiness, and I especially do not like to be nosy about other people's affairs, so I have no power to counterattack at all. Therefore, when I encounter a nosy person, I can only be the one who is nosy about.</p>
<p>The nosy person wants to be nosy about you anytime and anywhere. There is no need to care about things that are inquired about behind your back. Let me just say that as soon as he meets you, he can use skills to ask you how much money you earn in a month, how you are supporting your family, etc. If you have a leather bag, he can say "Is it okay to take a look?" while opening it to look. If you take out a book, he wants to take it and see what book it is. If you have a piece of paper clipped in the book, then it is definitely a must-see. If there is a letter in the book, he must know who wrote it, or who it is sent to. If something is showing in your shirt pocket, he will reach out and pull it out to see it clearly.</p>
<p>During small talk, he wants to inquire about your experience. If you cannot close the door to nosiness, his nose will keep stabbing into the depths of your past; whether you are a party member, whether you have been in prison, whether you are a traitor, etc. Of course, your family background cannot escape his questioning either. What did your ancestors do, is it a good family? Is your mother a concubine, are you an illegitimate child, and then investigate your wife.</p>
<p>If he comes to your office or your house, even a private detective would not rummage around like him. In short, if you have any secrets, you can be sure that in the end, he will completely have them in his grasp. Only then will he be satisfied and leave you.</p>
<h3>My Humble Opinion on Newspaper Size Reduction</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>Last month, the Central Propaganda Department limited the size of newspapers in various places to meters. Major newspapers in this city have successively reduced their size. Those originally published with three large sheets have been changed to three large sheets, those with three large sheets have been changed to two and a half sheets, and those with two and a half sheets have been similarly changed to two large sheets. Naturally, the original intention of the central government was to reduce paper imports and save foreign exchange. On the newspaper side, due to the soaring cost of raw materials, it was happy to comply. However, this has caused adverse consequences.</p>
<p>The first to be affected is the sales of newspapers. As far as I know, many newspapers have reduced their sales recently (perhaps some newspapers can maintain their original state). Of course, the price increase of newspapers this month is one of the reasons, but the biggest reason is still that the general readers feel dissatisfied with the content. Because the newspapers that have reduced their size have not been able to reduce advertising as initially intended (?), but what has been cut off are the supplements and special columns required by the intellectual class. Therefore, imperceptibly, the readers' interest in the newspapers is inevitably reduced by seventy or eighty percent.</p>
<p>Secondly, authors who make a living by selling articles have also been considerably hit. Due to the sluggishness of the publishing industry, the places where they can publish articles are already pitifully small. Their only market for selling manuscripts can be said to be the supplements and special columns of a few newspapers. Now that this type of space has been cut, it is tantamount to taking away their livelihoods; although, these are not related to the newspapers themselves; however, the suffering of the literati is also the sorrow of the future of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the impact of internal strife, cultural undertakings in the one or two years since victory have been facing a crisis just like other industries and businesses. The publishing industry is declining, and bookstores and newspaper offices are closing down; similarly, periodical magazines are shrinking, and the prices of single-volume books are soaring. Nowhere does not reveal the miserable state of the cultural world. In these two years of great famine for spiritual food, newspapers have formed the most desirable and most essential reading material for the people. If the size of newspapers is further reduced and the content of newspapers is further impoverished, then it will be a prelude to a more bleak cultural disaster.</p>
<p>Looking at the sales figures of The New York Times is really alarming. Then, why is it able to sell more than three million copies every day? The main reason is not due to its size and content! (The New York Times publishes 59 large sheets daily, including 10 magazine insertions, 3 commentary sheets, and 9 other forums.) Of course, with our financial resources, material resources, transportation and public standards, it is absolutely difficult to reach its level; however, this may serve as our reference: in order to increase the newspapers' own business, in order to rescue cultural workers, in order to shoulder the correct task of the newspapers, if the newspapers in this city cannot reduce the advertising area, it is still advisable to restore the original size (within three large sheets). To add one more sentence, if "cost is concerned" and "power is not sufficient", it is best not to reduce the size of the supplements and various special columns.</p>

<h3>Waterskiing</h3>
<p>— Xie Jun</p>
<p>"Waterskiing" is a newly emerging sport in Europe and America, with a very short history. Only fifteen years ago, a few French skiers suddenly thought of wearing wooden snow bridge-shaped skis to slide on the water surface to test their novel idea. The result was the creation of this alarming, exciting, and swift-as-wind sport. This sport requires courage, skill in swimming, and a strong physique: imagine being dragged by a speedboat hurtling at 68 miles per hour, stepping on skis, breaking through the waves on the water surface, with waves splashing like snow on both sides. Without the above-mentioned qualities, would you dare to try? But this sport can produce high stimulation. In the thrilling flying slide, you feel a sense of ethereal pleasure, like a seagull skimming across the water surface.</p>
<p>This sport has not been widely developed because it is limited by the economic conditions of acquiring expensive equipment. A "waterskiing" enthusiast must have a pair of skis that are 18 centimeters wide and 2 meters long (priced at more than 30 US dollars), a 20-meter long tow rope, and a fast speedboat with a speed of at least 32 miles per hour. Therefore, even in the United States, only about 10,000 people can enjoy this noble sport.</p>
<h3>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</h3>
<p>— Sun Peihua</p>
<p>This is a good play adapted from Betty Smith's novel. The original is one of the bestsellers in the United States. In terms of the overall performance, "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" on the screen is not necessarily better than the original, but it is definitely not inferior to Miss Betty's novel, that is certain.</p>
<p>From the perspective of general Hollywood films, "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" deserves a higher evaluation, not only for its achievements in performance technology, but we should say: it more or less suggests; in this unreasonable society, spiritual or rather spiritual wealth is more valuable than anything else.</p>
<p>We come into contact with too many women like Katie. It should be said that she is also kind by nature, but the tragic life has tortured her physically and mentally so terribly, but this is not what she wants. However, she finally realized: how precious the warmth between people should be!</p>
<p>The whole film from beginning to end is full of this kind of sentimentalist atmosphere. Here, Katie's coldness and willfulness and her daughter's thoughtfulness and enthusiasm are a very obvious contrast. The playwright (adapter) puts these two completely opposite forces like electricity, connecting them to the common object, Jonah, and from Jonah's induction, causing all kinds of emotional sparks. This is an extremely sensitive and successful approach.</p>
<p>Director Elia Kazan is worthy of praise, because he handled the atmosphere of the whole play so well, to the point of simple technique and remaining events, (such as using only two or three shots to introduce the slum, etc.). In terms of actors, Peggy Ann Garner, the little girl who played Florence, is a remarkable child star. Although the role itself is easy to please, her deep psychological performance is really too rare. Other actors such as James Dunn and Dorothy McGuire, who played the Nolan couple, are also above standard.</p>
<p>If it is said that "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" also has shortcomings, then it is that it overemphasizes the so-called "sentimentalism", and has not deeply revealed the truth of social reality behind sentimentalism, so that all the misery and pain of real life are all covered up in "warm feelings", still dragging a vague tail, saying: Although the school tree has been sawed off, it will still grow new green shoots. This new green shoot is also new hope.</p>
