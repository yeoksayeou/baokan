<h3>和談方式正待研究　孫科張羣等二三日返京　司使前夜晉謁主席談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕張治中於政協週年紀念日談，和談前途仍不悲觀，僅視吾人如何努力。至恢復和談，現有三種醖釀：（一）先談再改組政府（二）先改組再談（三）二者同時進行。此須待張羣近京後決定。現和談內容尚說不到，首先值得研究者為方式問題。渠對馬帥過去為促成我和平所作之努力表欽佩。張九日曾回訪豈必武，因　他出未值，十日晚赴蘇大使邀宴，並定十一日下午五時舉行記者招待會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕邵力子十日晨談，政府將派員赴延一說，余僅於今長報端獲悉，迄發言，問題僅在是否行得通，蓋中共企圖如何，政府方面尙未能暸解。邵以堅定之口吻稱：和平必然來臨，問題僅為用何種方法使其早日審現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電）聞政府派員赴延安計劃，係某中立外交方面所建議。邵力子對此表示，迄無所聞』衆信張羣或取為可能人選。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕司徒大使九日下午九時曾謁主席，談的半小時，十日上午十時王炳南訪司使交換意見。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕左舜生氏吿記者：今開兩日內，政府代表與靑年黨，將進行交換意見。論及和談事稱：重開和談無人反對，此為解決當前問題努力之一部份。至於此事能否實現，則關係兩黨以外者輕，而關係兩黨本身態度者里。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自孫院長建議召開黨派會議，協商解決國是後，記者以此詢諸各黨派，除中共不作答積外，靑年黨左舜生表示原則上贊成，民社黨徐傅霖亦表示不反對，但願明暸具體辦法。徐氏並讚揚孫院長團結各黨共謀國是之誠意。民盟方面則表示尙未加以研究，並謂民盟對常前時局之主張，不久將在政治宣言中發表。（孫院長對時局談話見另條）</p>
<h3>共黨仍堅持兩點　延安方面明日將發聲明</h3>

<h3>顧大使讚揚馬帥　使華任務可謂已獲成功</h3>

<h3>顧大使大美發表演說　我尊重條約義務　接收大連即將開始談判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：中國駐美大使顧維鈞，昨公開演講，討論大速問題，據謂：中蘇之正式談判，即將開始。</p>
<p>〔合衆社克里夫蘭九日電〕史國駐美大使顧維鈞，頃在本屆國際政治辯論會中發表演說，譴責蘇軍侵入東北與東南亞洲，乃屬遠反雅爾達協定，幷認為此種情熱頗有引起磨擦與不睦之可能，略謂：雅爾達會議，中國不獲被邀參加，自為蘇聯協力戰勝日本所得之代價，但會議中所決定之政策，祇僅能視為加緊戰爭所採取之權宜之計，雖然如此，其後果及影饗自不能僅限於戰爭期聞，致今日蘇聯立足東北之情形，佔有自西至東及自哈爾濱至大連之主要鐵路，伸展至白令海心臟之卡里爾羣島，幷與中國邊疆接壤三千里之長，凡此種種，皆屬反常狀態，故迅即收還大連，今尤為中國所重視。且以雅爾達協定為言，在道義及政治上，雖為一種共同合作運動，而一國竟要求另一國之代價，以犧牲第三國之利益，實屬聞所未開。中國為接受此項協定，幷簽訂一九四五年之中蘇條約，以作補充，中國抱定尊重其姜務之決心，故對方亦應尊重其美務，言至此，顧維鈞復指斥中共之行動足以離間中美二國之友好關係。幷謂：中共對政局拖延不決，將使經濟狀態益感窘迫，究其用意，中共乃欲繼續造成混亂局面，使政府身敗名裂，然後乘機奪取政權，處此情形之下，政府只得盡力推行其政治統一與經濟復興之計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十日電〕關於方面消息，關於中蘇雙方履行友好條的問題，聞在京巳有整個商討，同時雙方意見亦甚接近，現多半在研究技術問題，據云，雙方所談約有三大項目，（一）為中蘇切實共管中長路，目前交涉爭執之點，為我方力主以一九四五年以前中東路產權為限，蘇方則要求以日人經營之南滿鐵路產權包括在內，以上爭執可能求得折中辦法解決。（二）為蘇方提出蘇國外貿易局在東北各地於蘇軍撤退前，向日人買得產權問題。（三）為我接收大連問題，前二問題如先得解決，則大連我可能早日接收。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十日電〕外交部東北區特派員公署，前曾派科長徐立羣前往安東，協助當地軍方交涉接防水關滿發電廠拉古哨堤壩之具體問題，徐氏曾一度與鴨綠江橋蘇方之駐軍取得連絡，並以第三綏靖區司令趙公武名義，致函北部朝鮮蘇方駐軍司令，商洽會談日期，至今多日，外交部特派員公署接到安東方面之報吿稱：迄今尙未獲得蘇方之答覆，會談尙無確期。</p>

<p>我國於對外戰爭獲勝之後，一躍為强國之一，眞所謂天與人歸，千載一時，不幸繼之而發生了大規模的武力政爭，以致人民苦痛萬狀，為國際所騰笑。以武力從事政爭，原為野蠻落後之方式，現代國家中早己絕跡、就是一度發生希臘與伊朋的內戰，亦已吿解決，而我國於勝利一年又半之後，內戰不但未息，且看日趨劇烈持久之勢，此不論在朝或在野，政府或人民，均當引為奇恥大辱的。</p>
<p>回憶一年之前，政治協商會義舉行的寺候，人民喁隅望治，舉國充滿了閻結友愛的空氣，其所戚立的各項協議，無疑是中國達到和平統一民主建設的唯一路綫，這不但常時促成這一會議的馬歇爾特使，在他最近的聲明和報吿中，仍然這樣肯定，就是年來時局的演變，也可以說是一個有力的明證，　使參加會議的各黨派，不為本身的主觀的立塲和一時的利害所蔽，而能於會議閉慕後，開誠布公，推誠相與，一致使聯合政府迅速成立，我確信，中國一年來的攻局，無論如何，總比目前要大有進步的。</p>
<p>在政協周年紀念的時候，我人讀到了馬歇爾的聲明，於敬佩其持論之公平與正確之餘，尤其應當深自反省的。現在國內政爭的形勢，是這樣的險惡，我人要不於此時開闢途徑從速解決問題，而聽其發展下去，則我國家前途眞要不堪設想了。我以為，解決問題的方法，最好於不久的將來，各黨派負責代表（自然連中國共產黨代表在內）再來舉行一次圓桌會談，大家都能放棄成見與主觀願望，重視國內以至於國際的客觀現實，一本和衷共濟的團結精神，為中國全體人民的幸福設想，我相信一切問題是可以和平解法的，我謹向各方提出如是的建議，並希望全國人民起來促其實現。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>經濟問題的焦點</h3>
<p>現在社會上擾攘不安的現象，無過於經濟問題，而經濟問題中的癥結，尤無過於金融問題。有人人為經濟界的種種紛擾，多半由金融所造成，所促進，其實也不算過　其辭。因為外匯問題，幣制問題，高利貸問題，黃金問題，物價問題，銀行制度問題，戰前存款的償付問題等這些縣案，故是彰明較著的金融問題，而我們耳目所及，由於金融問題的紛擾，所引起的其他枝節問題，尤不在少數，茲撮舉數事如次：</p>
<p>（一）商業行莊的復員問題　卅四年一月二十二日，財政部頒佈牧復區商業銀行復員補充辦法，原限三個月內，所有甲·乙。兩類行莊，應提出各項文件，呈請復員，渝期即不予核辦。或須勒令停業，或不准其復業。其後雖特准展限，亦抵准展至卅五年七月十五日為止，並沒有續准再展。但事實上申請副業，聽說：迄今還可以接受，而當地市縣政府證明與地方金融關係密切的一跳，似乎又嫌太抽象，致惹起許多意外的糾葛，。值此限制新設行莊嚴格執行的時候，本問題的嚴重性，却不容漠視，我們認為財政部對於此事的態度，實在不夠明朗。</p>
<p>（二）美鈔的黑市問題　就事實論，美鈔的黑市為物價波動的重要因素之一，就法　論，甲國的貨幣，在乙國劉同，為難已索解之事。而且中央和地方政府已再三申禁，不許再有黑市，不許再以外幣為支付物價及房租的工具。無奈禁者自禁，用者自用，彼此各行其是，似乎不相干涉，最近對於某種外貨，並有「外匯自理」的傳統。假如所說不處，那麼不用美鈔，不知這項外匯，怎樣可以自理？自理如须美鈔，除掉求諸黑市以外，不知還有沒有其他的途徑？現在的黑市，超過官定的限度，已不知若干倍，更不知從前所定的美鈔買賣辦法，是否已經明白廢止或修正？有人解釋：禁止外鈔流通，事實上卻又許多為難之處，這當然是事實。不過軍輿以前，外鈔充斥，還甚於今日，爾時政府統一法幣，禁止外鈔，確乎狠收功效。我們不相信：在廢止不平等跳躍以後，其困難反甚於從前。</p>
<p>（三）鈔票的檢點和攜帶問題　鈔票的優點之一，即是攜帶上的便利，遠勝於硬幣，這是大家工人的事實。不過這項便利，現在已完全小時了。而且整紮成昆的鈔票，儘管印章斑爛，封誌完好，而實際上私搭小票，明偷暗損，已是公開的事實。坐使無辜的民眾，橫被侵蝕，徒呼奈何，並且發生無數的糾紛，負　當局，諒來未必不知道吧？但我們世忠沒有見過什麼有效的措置。</p>
<p>（四）退票問題　退票是法律上的問題，不但是道德上的問題。但是現在的退票，竟其成千　萬，毫無顧忌。據交換所歷次發表的退票數目，已將超過戰前正常的交換額，但是知道如今，還沒有切實防止的辦法。行政和司法方面，大約是事不干己，自可存而不論。</p>
<p>（五）商業行莊的監督問題　對於商業行莊的設立或復員，事前的核准手續，原很慎重，事後又有經常檢查的機關，存款，借款，並定有準備·審核等辦法，而投機·囤貨·黃金和地產等抵押，又皆在禁止之列。當局之維護金融，導入正軌，亦可謂至矣整矣，無以附加矣。不過市場上稍有風波，總有一類不慎穩健之行號，直接或間接地捲入漩渦，難以自拔的。如果說：這類行莊，完全是自作自受，理應淘汰，用不著加以顧惜，這自然也有相當的理由。所可怪的，是自有一般幸災樂禍的人，老實乘人之危，意圖取而代之。其手法特別高明的，或竟七折八扣，重利盤剝，陽予濟急之名，陰受高利之實，過就不能不說是怪現象了。</p>
<p>（六）貸款問題　關於各種貸款的手續，早已引起許多非難。因為明明是救濟性質的貸與，下以此求，上以此應，大家既明白承認，那麼，除掉必要的調查和擔保，確實可以防止其流入不正當的用途以外，凡事可以劉同的，似應特別體卹，不該處處從生意眼上着想。諸如往來行莊的　頭和無限制的担保，以及其他細碎的手續，似乎還可以商量。現在不是有許多戶頭，望而卻步，寗可放棄這項恩惠嗎？當局方面，不是也有更求簡化和放寬的表示嗎？這也可以反證現行辦法的過份麻煩了。</p>
<p>大眾明白，現在正事公私交困的時候。工商業方面，固然嗷嗷待哺，渴　政府的救急，政府的財政，早已到了靠發鈔來應急的地步，也何　有充分的餘力，來滿足一般的無厭之求？照常理論，流通金融，扶助工商，本事一般商業行莊的天職。他們力有未逮，　發生特殊情勢的時候，方才轉求國家銀行來作他們的後盾。所謂銀行之銀行，其意義，即在此等場合，要國家銀行來幫助，並不是要他獨任艱鉅，來替代一般銀行的業務。所以財政當局，一面故须充實國家銀行，使他克盡其職責，同時，對於一般商業行莊，仍須儘量輔助，充分利用，以共儘調劑金融責任。真所調如車兩輪，如鳥兩翼，稍有傷頗，便要影響到一般乃至其自身的力量，這是一個狠明　的理論。現在的情形，到底如何，我們不願深加推　，但是取消四聯，國家銀行專業化等呼聲，早有人在主張　，而取消商業行莊的放款限額，和見底存款準備金等，並已部份的實在，可知商業行莊的扶　，也還待繼續努力。</p>
<p>其餘如資金的逃避，備汇的傍溢，以及東北和台灣的畸形幣制，均待設法矯正，以繼全國的幣制，和鞏固國家的資源。所以現在的迫切問題，似已集中在金融這一點上。希望有關各方面，認淸楚這一點，集中力量，把他先解決了，然後整個的經濟問題，方好依次爬梳。</p>

<h3>克利浦斯夫人稱　英人應繼續援華　對援華基金分配極滿意</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦九日電〕英聯合援華會主席克利浦斯夫人，今晚於倫敦記者招待會中稱：渠此次中國之行，使渠深信英聯合援華會應繼續其工作，蓋在增進兩國友誼方面，有確切之任務待其履行也。若援華會因戰事停止其工作，則將為兩國前途關係之不幸，故目前乃考驗英對華友誼之時期。克利浦斯夫人並稱：援華會基金能廣泛用於中國生活之各方面，實足令人驚奇，渠對中國人民能真誠認識援華會基金乃英國人民為中國人民福利而出築之　金一事，至感鼓舞。克氏對此項基金能以公正巧妙之方法分配予若干組織，亦極滿意。蓋中國各地有七百余組織，（包括延安方面）均獲得援華會之援助也。克利浦斯夫人於記者前往訪問之時，對中國報界加以讚揚。渠稱：無論渠至中國何地，舉行記者招待會時，到會人士均極踴躍，雖然，有時有若干記者以令其極窘困之問題見詢，但渠等並稱：渠在華時，獲得在各方面勘察人民生活之　動及便利，渠並提及延安之行及曾與宋慶齡晤談之事。</p>

<p>自政府公佈兵役法後，徵兵亦隨之開始，因同胞知識水準不够，故每一新政創始，必生一番紛擾，何况是兵役。在知識不足的同胞聽來，事實上已感到恐怖，更加鄉保長事先缺少宣傳，以至發生種稱紛擾。鄙人忝屬國民一份子，對於兵役，自當擁護，爰獻一得之見，提供參考：</p>
<p>（一）同胞怕當兵，是素來的積習和當前的知識不够，要同胞不怕當兵，治本在教育，治標宜宣導。治本固非朝夕之事，但治標因基層工作人員，無充份準備，無怪同胞莫明所以而要生怕逃避了，他們挑避的方法是代丁，而雇用代丁每一人，爲數綦鉅，一任鄉保長分派，某丁應出丁費若干，　庫的同胞，在怕被徵的情緒下，祇得無可奈何地忍痛付錢，試間這稱壯丁，於國有益嗎？國家徵兵，旨在防患於未然，而隨時隨地可應付突發事變，但這種壯丁，如何應付呢？其次，這類壯丁，可循環式的做代丁工作，久而久之，必將演成職業兵員，萬一一旦有事，必致措手無策，這嚴重性豈容忽視！故鄙意以為政府（　）在開始徽丁之先，剴切　導兵役之意義及任務，並切實告誡不得代丁。如有代丁，應如何處以　則。（乙）徵集之壯丁，嚴厲撿查其素質，如發見代丁疑點，應予斥退，責成經徵人改送。</p>
<p>（二）窮同胞因生計關係，也怕被徵，因他本來已度日維艱，一旦被微後，其家屬有立做餓殍的資格，政府雖也顧到這點，有緩役規定，但緩役只得緩徵一時，在緩役期間，這位窮同胞的經濟，不見得就會好轉，那末緩期過後怎麼辦呢？所以鄙意莫如組織壯丁互助會，互助會宗旨，（甲）凡被抽中壯丁，確係担負全家生活者，規定供給互助金，其金額按生活指數得隨時調整，互助金每月一付，付給其家屬，（乙）該互助金由本保全體壯丁平均分担。（丙）該丁役滿後，也須盡同樣義務。（何仲謀）</p>
<p>流亡者急需國民證</p>
<p>我是從淮安逃亡到上海的，雖有處樓身，不受風餐露宿之苦，但思鄉之心，無時或釋。幸我軍於九月中旬，收復淮安城，當聞此喜訊之餘，不勝雀躍，恨不能插翅飛回家去。待將束裝返里時，忽接家中來信云，凡流亡在外者，非持有國民身份證，不得進城，就是一路住客棧亦不容易，故我遂向保辦事處登記。（因我來滬時第一期登記已過）實指望十天半月即可領取回家，不意迄今兩月有餘，仍無消息，如是拖延，怎能不呌我心中焦急呢！</p>
<p>因貴報乃是人民喉舌，故懇將此函披露，並希有關當局，速將後補之國民身份證發交各保甲長分發於聲請人，以便許多流亡者得早回故里，骨肉團聚。（流渡者劉體鴻）</p>
<p>本市糞便承包問題</p>
<p>關於本市的糞便承包問題，最近又鬧得甚嚣麇上，因為是大利所在，各方亦競相逐鹿，希圖取得這筆好買賣，立刻變成一個鉅當，無論他們道一把算盤打得穩與不穩，我們可不管，但我們站在公共衛生的立塲上，實有一加檢討的必要。</p>
<p>這一個問題，凡是老於上海的人，都知道於過去數十年來，歷由市政負責當局，把這樣一件重大衛生工作，假手於幾個承包商人辦理的，以致造成了幾個糞大王，還潛蓄成了一種特殊的勢力，至今存在着，一時無法加以剷除。即一個里弄，有一個糞夫把持着，一個地段，有一個車主把持着，一個碼頭，有一個碼頭主任把持着，一個區域，有一個糞太王把持着，他們上下勾結，操縱着這一宗利益，決不輕易讓勞人插足的，因此他們對於這一件衛生工作，並不加以重視，惟利是圖，以收入爲第一，弄得糞未可以任意向住戶需索月費，節要節賞，年要年賞，不稱心時可以任意拒絕傾倒，甚至聯合罷倒，而當局和數百萬居民，却有奈何他們不得之慨　承包制度的應吾恢復，只要把擺在面前的事實一看，不但衛生行政當局認得非常淸楚即每一個居民也決不會贊同它復活的。自從卅四年十一月將包商永大公司改爲官商合辦，繼於卅五年四月一日經市政會議毅然決議，已正式成立了消潔所，完全收歸市辦後，全市市民都寄以深切的期待，希望當局能對這一！賢明的措施，切究的推行，把這數十年來的我政，一旦改革。記得當時與論界，並大事鼓勵，蓋每一個市民都深受過包商所賜予的痛苦，莫不期望從糞大王的手中解放出來。但是時隔幾何，現在却又鬧着承包制度的復活了。道就不得不使人引爲驚異。聽說自從淸潔所成立以後，每月收入逐漸增加，近來每月收入總在三四億元以上，與包商從中取利時期比較，已不可同日而語，假使說是爲了要增加市庫收入而恢復承包制度，顯然已沒有理由，那麽究屬爲了什末呢？爲了推行工作上遭遇了困難，或欲將道改進公共衛生的責任加諸幾、個惟利是圖的包商身上，而自己逃避這責任嗎？那就更不能成爲理由。同時我們的衛生當局也不應該，也無法逃避一個責任的。</p>
<p>現在不她再來檢討一下，自從淸潔所成立以來的成績關於淸潔所內部的情形如何，固非局外人所能深悉，但就我們見到的來講，例如　夫的勒索拒倒，一經市民報告，該所對於犯規的茵　夫現在已改好了許多，關於月費數額，及公副便紙。售價之規定，和取結節賞等，亦經該所迭次公告，原來漫無標準的，現在全市市民也已有所適從，糞車運糞以及碼頭工作時間原來暹早不定的，現在也都能遵守規定的時間，在積弊深重下，這一小小的改善，雖不能盡使人滿意，却已是難能可貴，我們決不袒護現在的淸潔行政工作人員，祗希望衛生當局更能遴選幹練人才，來擔負這一件與數百萬市民切身有關的衛生工作，使之更能改進，以慰市民喁喁之望</p>
<p>據節前幾天的報載，糞使承包制度又在死灰復燃，並且已由市府通過，還提出意見數點，行將提交本屆市參議會衛生委員會討論和通過，謹希望我們的市參議會諸公及市政當局，應爲大衆的福利着想，寄希望於少數的惟利是圖的包商，根本就是不合理的。（陳樂健）</p>

<h3>美國政府新預算案　杜魯門向國會提出　額達三百七十五億美元以上　國防經費仍佔最大部份</h3>
<p>〔聯合華盛頓十日電〕杜魯門總統今日以七月一日起一年間之美政府預計，計三百七十五億二千八百萬美元，送交國會，並　請切弗核减稅率。惟共和黨議員稱，可將此數削减八十億美元，其主張减稅者，立意頗爲堅定，杜總統之按年預算諮文中估計，如果所得稅照常徵收，則政府至一九四八年六月三十日，即下一財政年度結束之日，可剩餘二億〇二百萬美元，再若現定七月一日起减低之奢侈稅，國會准許繼續徵收，而郵政總局增加郵資，彌補郵政經費之不足，則此剩餘數可增至八億美元。民主黨員所稱可以减低稅率，依然平衛預算一節，杜總統不以爲然，聲稱：「此乃現實的預算，在吾人能力範圍之內，已極完善。茍有剩餘款項，應用以償付總數現達二千六百〇四億美元之公債」。杜總統以六十七億五千八百萬美元撥給陸軍，四十四億二千三百萬美元撥給海軍，又稱「國防經費仍爲預算中最大之一項，吾人仍負有因戰爭而起之重大責任，歐洲與遠東之軍事佔領，必須賡續進行。國防經費，固定支出，退還稅款，國際費用及協助退伍軍人，共需三百三十億美元，不能裁减。其餘乃各部院與機關進行程序之經費，各部院與機關所要求之經費，遠較預算之數爲多。」</p>

<h3>英美軍備標準化　蒙帥將向蘇解釋　英美成立任何協議蘇聯均可參加　各界熱烈招待空氣和諧</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十日電〕英國參謀總長蒙哥馬利，其姓名常與大砲爲緣，而與外交方面關係較少，今乃成爲英國最新之宣慰使。據草斯科電，蒙帥在蘇聯，將以英美軍備標準化事向之解釋，與以安慰，此次訪問，實爲邇來英國人士赴蘇最重要之代表，其所負使命至巨。蘇聯對於英美軍備標準化事，頗爲惴惴，嘗問曰：世界上除蘇聯而外，尚有何國實力龐大，需由英美兩國聯合抵抗？美國視爲僅係平常應用一九三九年所獲之教訓，而蘇聯則欲觀其反而文章。美國工業於一九三九年開始爲英法兩國特製兵器，其後各處軍火廠仍不得不改變計劃，依舊採用美國式。蘇聯亦知統一軍備與美國欲在加拿大北部建立軍事根據地有聯帶關係。此事因一部份加拿大人認爲依此計劃，將使加拿大與美國之結合加强，而與英國之聯繫减弱，致無成議。然使某全部計劃將英國一併加入在內，則加拿大總理麥根齊金當更易折服其國人。蘇聯對於美國在加拿大設防之計劃，未免不安。蒙哥馬利此行任務，顯欲告知莫斯科政府。第一，毋庸驚惶；第二，兩國軍備標準化，在世界尚未安定之日，自英美立塲觀之，頗爲合理；第三，英美兩國成立之任何交易，蘇聯均可參加，其門戶並不關閉；第四，英美之軍事準備，與蘇聯欲將其四周弱國結合成一防禦環—用意正復相同。</p>

<h3>安理會討論裁軍問題　美蘇一場舌戰　瓊斯堅主優先討論原子問題　澳提折衷案擬調和美蘇意見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖九日電〕聯合國安全理事會今日展開裁軍問題之全而辯論，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯指責美國企圖延宕普遍裁軍方案之實施，謂美國主張原子能管制問題優先討論，暗示「汝等倘贊成美國之原子管制方案，則吾人將贊成草擬音遍裁軍方案之實施步驟，反之，美國之原子方案如不能順利進行，則吾人一概拒絕裁軍實施步驟之草擬」。辯論之初，澳洲代表曼金警告「目前非爭論之時」，旋提出折衷案冀以調和美蘇爭執。</p>
<p>依照曼氏折衷案，安全理事會當接受聯合國大會所通過之裁軍方案，然後採取三項切實步驟，（一）依照蘇聯提議，設立委員會立即討論步驟，實施大會決議，樹立國際管制，確保軍隊與軍備之裁减。（二）接受原子能委員會之報告，作爲繼續討論之藍本，並加速成立國際原子管制公約。（三）聯合國警備軍問題應即提交軍事參謀會議討論，注意大會關於全體會員國政府提供軍隊實力報告之決議案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖九日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯在安理會中指責美國阻碍裁軍問題之討論後，美國代表瓊森即加駁覆，堅主管制原子問題應優先討論。據稱：「原子能之有效的國際管制，乃爲整個計劃之關鍵，必須首先討論。原子能倘不首先管制，則其他軍備管制難以成功。自吾人觀之，管制原子能乃爲嘗試案件。吾人相信安理會應祖保原子問題方面之重大進展，然後討論傳統的軍備之管制與栽减，因此乃次要的問題。」瓊氏否認美國有意延宕，並稱美國準備贊同軍備調整計劃，但以原子問題優先討論爲條件。</p>

<h3>捕魚新法　不用鈎餌綱罟　利用音波誘魚入殻</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕日本漁人不久將以新法捕魚，毋需用網。最近有田口博士等發明一種發音器，使傳統的捕魚方法爲之一變，鈎餌網罟均可廢棄。其法係在出海之漁船上裝置機器，發出怪聲，驅魚向岸。然後另用機器發出美妙之音樂，引誘魚類，使其在迷惘中容易就捕。據田口博士稱，我人已知炙類對於某種聲音，有特殊反應，最近之技衛，不過就此種智識加以科學的應用而已。聲音有爲魚類所喜，亦有爲魚類所不喜者。美國人曾用聲音查知鯡魚聚居之處，今日本將首先利用音波以捕魚。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕公用局長趙曾珏，昨在大會對日前各參議員之質詢，作口頭答覆：（一）公用局對外商公司之管理方針，為尊重合約，執行法令，改善管理，提高效率。對外商與華商均一律看待。各外商公司亦均有良好之合作。（二）限制電燈用電，原已決定自二月一日起取銷七折及最低二十度之限制。改以上年十一月份實用電量為標準。惟不得超出，其不足三十度者得用至三十度。罰金亦改用警告辦法，滿三次警告者停電。不久將來電力稍增時，當再放寬至屋外霓虹燈，亦於昨日會商決定自四月一日起開放。（三）南市電燈時常斷電，係因電力公司發電機一部發生障礙之故。（四）取締人力車係奉中央命令辦理。現已抽簽淘汰之人力車，已改裝三輸車，仍由原車夫駕駛，對車夫生計亦不成問題。（五）公共汽車已增至一百二十餘輛。電車亦由三百卅二輛增至三百八十六輛。（六）現上海電話公司，已向法國訂購新機一萬號，二月中即可有一部到滬。（七）「〇二」電話接綫遲緩問題，當飭上海電話公司注意改善。（八）路燈裝置，本年一月前當可全部完成。（九）調整電車路綫問題，因牽涉拆屋放寬路面，征用土地問題，正請示中央中。（十）本市車輛較載前增加者為三輪車一四八六一輛，此為載前所無，本市交通擁擠之最大原因為全市統一後車輛集中中區之故。至分區行駛辦法，已由市長提請大會商討。（十一）垃圾橋限制三輪車等通行，原係一時解決交通擁擠辦法。上午八時前及下午六時後，仍可通行。月內工務局將盆湯　橋修好後，即可開放。（十二）東昌路碼頭輪渡對江渡票一百六十元零找問題，已由上午十二月十一日起改為二百元，而將長途票價減低。至職員態度問題，當飭輪渡公司糾正，并望市民隨時檢舉。（十三）棚戶未取得營造執照前先行接電問題，在原則上建屋者應先取得營造方能開始建屋，新建房屋裝置電燈與營造工程同時進行，本局并無限制。</p>

<h3>請願四起　攤販要求全日開放　學生請求保存劇校</h3>

<p>又市立實驗戲劇學校學生昨亦列隊向市參議會請願，申述理由請求保存劇校，當由童行白·周斐成兩參議員予以接見，以無權決定，允予提交大會討論。此外到會請願者，尚有旅商業公會永安紗廠男女工人等兩起。</p>
<p>（三）營業稅未予加速征收原因，乃以其中大部份係攤販，為顧及小販生計，特延至陰曆年底後再收。（四）郊區學校領款不易，乃因辦理發款人員僅係三人之故。各校積久未領，一時過忙，次序難以維持。同時按照中央規定，支款手續過繁，躭誤時間甚多，至職員態度決嚴加申斥改善。（五）市政建設捐罰款期限規定於送達後三週為限，如有於期前罰金者均應退回，例如誤罰唐參議員世昌款額，經調查後已予退回。（六）近發現有假冒財局向外界銷售營業稅法及房捐收據等情事，曾加以調查，但無結果，惟財局從不派員出售任何物品，至於收款亦統歸會計處辦理，故如有發現此類事件，請即報告。（七）去年市政建設捐收到六十億餘元，但并未超出預算，因其他部門均短收故也。</p>
<p>又據谷局長告記者稱：本市公債現有（一）舊市府二種，已奉令向四行登記聽候處理，三十五年底應付本息三千六百餘萬元，以稅收作抵押，將由本年度預算內撥發。（二）前公共租界六種，卅五年應付本息一千四百餘萬元，已送上海市公共租界及法租界官有資產與義務債務清理委員會辦理。（三）前法公董局十一種，亦正積極清理。</p>

<h3>棚戶不建不拆　浦江擬築隧道　工務局長答覆質</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工務局長趙祖康答覆日前參議員之口頭質詢：（一）棚戶問題為整個社會經濟問題，工務局必須顧到平民居住，公眾安全，與業主地權有無抵觸等三問題。工務局自始至終，無嚴格取締辦法，而取締亦不一定是拆。目前在禁建區內抱定「不建不拆」主張，即已有的不拆，但不準新建。至今對正在搭建中的棚戶共取締七起，戶主皆能聽從勸告。希望市參議會能將棚戶問題，全權交市府辦理，隨時予以指示，市府一定顧到各方，給各位圓滿答覆。（二）棚戶數字，據準確調查，在禁建區內共八三二七戶，在非婪區者六三七六二戶，共計七二〇八九戾，其中向工務局領執照者祇三〇五三張。（三）疏濬河道事，工程技術由工務局負責，籌劃徵工由各區公所負責。一等幹河中，黃浦江由濬浦局負責，蘇州河由工務局補助一部份經費。蘊藻浜已經資勘，本年尚不需疏濬。另二等河　共十餘條，本年度將疏濬者七八條。（四）浦江大橋，技術研究方面，非工務局所有人材能辦，故已交中國橋樑公司設計，擬定：低架活動橋樑需費四百六十億，隧道需費七百九十億，而高架固定橋樑橫在上海不適合。研究之下，隧道雖較低架活動橋樑工程費大，但就各方面度之，比較最好。審查經過交由越江工程委員會討論。鼉架設地點，容量，經費等，皆尚須策劃研究。（五）過去一年馬路工程憶修一百多萬平方公尺，因材料欠佳及行經車輛太多，就中至少有二十萬平方公尺是壞了又修，現尚有二百多萬平方公尺未修。祇修路中，不修路邊，係因材料與經費等關係，因路中須承受重量大卡車，而路邊祇走人力車之故。（六）撤除南市一部份地帶敵偽遺留障碍工程事，因未經當地軍事機關同意，現尚在交涉中。</p>

<h3>今日大會議程　上午審查預算下午討論提審　并通知物資供應局出席報告　　〔本報訊〕市參議會今日上午將舉行全體審查大會，討論卅六年度預算，市府政報告，中心工作計劃，及各局施政報告。并已通知行政院物資供應局局長江杓於上午十時出席大會報告。下午則繼續討論提案。民田三百餘畝　軍事上有需要　祝平說未能發還原因在此　　〔本報訊〕地政局祝平對日前參議員之質詢案作口頭答覆稱：（一）敵偽在浦東朱家橋附近佔用民田三百餘畝，闢作高射砲陣地事，市政府復員後，在前年十一月曾接業主申請發還之要求，惟曾時因第三方而軍司令部說明有重事上需要，請予保留。經地政局與第三方面軍司令部會同派員實地勘查，據稱仍有軍事上需要，究竟如何當待研究後答覆，惟至今尚未見有答覆到來。現旣經提出，本局當行文京滬衛戍司令部湯恩伯將軍處詢問，如已無需要，當發還業主。（二）地價稅自去年十一月十六日開征至十二月三十一日，共實收三十億七千萬元，上次參議會曾規定地價稅徵收三十億，至去年底已征足，且超過七千萬，地政局祇征不收，收款另由市金庫派員負責。至征得後之支配用途，因一切由市府統籌統支，故如何支配可問財政局。關於已征者有多少畝一點，須待詳查。（三）希市府將公地出租予平民以解決一部份房荒問題事，去年八月底市府所擬訂之解決房荒辦法中，已規定將公地出租造屋，故此提案與市府魘定方針符合。且市府不但將公地出租，且規定新建房屋免除地價稅二年房捐一年，以提倡建造新屋。（四）敵偽時期非法出賣公地清查結果，關於舊工部局及法公董局請示中央已得結果，因牽涉外交，正分頭與英法交涉，尚我具體結果。另偽市府出租出售者，憶宣告無效。（五）地價稅之一征係已指辦理土地登記之區域而言，未辦登記地區，仍征田賦。（六）開征地價稅時地價估計之標準，係由依照中央規定組織之評價委員會調查討論後確定。地價劃分係根據區域決定平均價，并非每塊估定。故價低者稍便宜。價高者難免吃虧。地價今年擬重估，屆時當儘量注意改正。至言地價稅之征收為何不顧及為主收入一點，因地價稅為財產稅，不根據收入，依中央土地法規定，空地亦要收稅，且收重稅。（六）土地所有權狀，至今尚未發下一點，因審查手續須經十五種程序，且依法尚需有二月公告時間，因法令手續如此，實出不得已。但業主需要時可領回，拍照後繳還，以免妨碍業主資金之運用。十一區場內外菜販　解決辦法商定　　〔本報訊〕十一區場外菜販，向參議會請願，要求在原外設攤，惟場內菜販，亦向該會請願，要求場外菜販遵照警局取締辦法，遷至菜場三百碼以外，雙方相持不下。經議長派嚴諤聲·唐世昌兩參議員會同警察局方處長志超，衛生局長張維，共商解決辦法，結果議定：（一）原在場內後遷出至場外之菜販八十餘單位，仍須遷八場內原設攤基營業（二）菜場正面山海關路，自成都路口起，至山海里止，側面成都路，自山海關路口起，至三德里止，場外菜販一律遷出，不準設攤。（三）其他各處，照常不動。（四）此項辦法，暫準至陰曆年底為止。惟方處長聲明，將來除菜場正面及側面兩不準設攤外，其他各處倘不妨礙交通，則至限期時查繼續延長準予設攤，否則仍須取締。預算小組會審查結果　認為可凈加四一三億　對市府龐大組織仍希望緊縮　　〔本報訊〕市參議會預算委員會根據前日市府各局處報告預算後，特於昨晚七時，假徐參議員永祚住宅舉行小組審查會，審查本年度預算，由何參議員元明任主席，潘議長亦親自出席。經該會初步審議，擬將經常門內酌量增減一部分，結果可凈加四一三億四千餘萬元。計增加者：地價稅三六億，營業稅二八〇億，屠宰稅四八億，營業牌照稅三六億，碼頭捐一五一億，遺產稅二億，罰金三億八千餘萬元，行政規費十億，事業規費八八億，溢地收入一億三千餘萬元。合計約五二億元，遞減部門：使用牌照稅一八億，筵席稅四八億，旅棧捐四二億，合計約一〇八億元。娛樂稅則維持原狀。　　該會審查預算，極感困難，因收入部門不能多加，支出部門又難以減少，但市府組織實太龐大，機構繁多，人員過眾，故僅能在緊縮裁并之原則下請市府考慮，并將以此意見交今日大會討論。請確定直轄市國大名額　通電全國一致擁護憲法　　〔本報訊〕市參議會大會昨在潘議長主持下，開始討論提案，結果通過有關民政方面之提案六件。其中擬建議立法院以法律規定直轄市應選出之國大代表名額，以補憲法之掛漏而示公允一案，駱清華·陶百川·瞿鋮等相繼熱烈發言，以國大此次通過規定國大代表組織之憲法第二十六條，對於直轄市殊為吃虧，應請確定直轄市之地位，直轄市每區等於省之一縣，產生一代表。討論結果照原案通過，由本會分函其他各直轄市參議會共同主張向中央建議。　　周濂澤等二十三人臨時緊急動議，擬請通電全國擁護憲法案，經決議一致通過。　　另通過民政方面之提案為：（一）建議市政長官定期巡視郊區以資促進郊區建設。（二）市政府應即將第一次大會議決案迅速執行以重民意。（三）提請市政府當局裁減冗員，提增工作人員待遇俾免情弊。（四）建議中央早日確定直轄市市民之自治權，并由本會議擬訂本市自治法草案。（五）本市各郊區應迅予成立民眾自衛隊等五案。　　嚴陳婚禮誌盛　　陳布　氏女公子陳陳琇，與本報同仁嚴晉，昨日下午三時，假新生活俱樂部舉行婚禮，由吳市長國楨證婚，介紹人為潘公展·程滄波兩氏，來賓到孔祥熙·張群·張道藩·劉維熾·洪蘭友·洪陸東·蕭錚·陶希聖·宣鐵吾·劉攻芸·張肇元·林彬·夏晉熊·及錢新之·周作民·徐寄庼·王曉籟·魏伯楨·劉鴻生·方椒伯·孫鶴　·秦潤卿·謝蘅聰·葉溯中·胡健中·潘公弼·馮在真等五百餘人。三時正舉行結婚禮，首由證婚人吳市長致詞，繼由介紹人潘公展·程滄波致詞，來賓演說有胡健中·孔祥熙·洪蘭友等。車水馬龍，盛極一時。（圖為新夫婦儷影本報記者攝）法商電車　慢工事件　請速秉公截斷　立即恢復常態　　〔本報訊〕市參議員史致富等二十六人，昨在大會中提出之臨時動議：「法商電車公司所駛公共車輛行動緩慢，速請主管當局立即督飭改善，以利交通。」案，經大會決議：本案應請市府速令公用社會兩局尅日秉公截斷，飭該公司立即恢復平常交通狀態，如有任何上方不服截斷，應予依法制裁。　　據吳市長對於此案表示：此事係勞資糾紛，但責任不盡在公司方面，吾人對於勞方應予同情協助，但勞方在未經調解仲裁前，有意工行為，實屬不法。　　又邵永生等所提之臨時動議為棚戶問題，要求根據不苛擾小民，不妨害公眾安全之原則，交由工務，社會，法規委員會及五局代表定期開聯席會議，擬具具體辦法交由政府切實施行。經大會決議無異議通過。年賞問題陷僵局　各晚報昨仍停刊　　本市大晚，聯合等各晚報勞資間因年賞問題不能解決，致於前日起一致停刊。據各晚報工友負責人談稱：「各報關於年賞問題資方已願允發一月，且一部已預支半數但迄今尚未全數發給，資方突於八日晚採取聯合行動，宣佈年賞半個月之硬性規定，強制執行，以致前昨兩日資方停止發稿，勞方無法工作，此一資任，應由各報當局負之，吾人一年三百六十餘日中，無休無息，手腦并用，出汗出力，無日不在緊張中生活，設或病假事假，必須另出高價覓取替工，旣無星期例假，又無升工補工，故一年十二個月中，實際收入不足十個月，每月僅念餘萬薪津，故我人此次要求一個月，實屬天公地道，合情合理。至於資方困難自是實情，惟辦報者什九皆告虧損，我人決不能因噎廢食也。」　　又上海市夜報聯誼會昨致各夜報工友書，略云：這次六家晚報諸位工友提出來的關於年賞問題，我們認為是應該寄予同情的，我們在原則上全部接受，問題是在於上海整個工商凋敝的情況中，我們的努力已經用盡，而且已經越過了我們的能力。所以我們從來不認為工友的要求，應該棄置不顧，而只希望互相諒解實際困難，尋求一個合於雙方實情的解決方式，希望在諸位的體諒下，早日恢復我們報人對社會應盡的天職。所以我們極端願意我們之間的問題，能够趕快解決。蠢盜　自投羅綱　〔本報訊〕福建中路三七〇號錫成煙紙店，曾於本月五日晚八時半，被盜匪五六名，以搜查煙毒為由，刧去現鈔六十六萬元及金飾等，臨行尚嫌不足，竟迫令店主高煥仁出具煤業銀行一百萬元之支票一紙。事後高即投報警察局，經該局酈課長派幹員着手偵查。至七月下午，匪徒因該支票係屬劃綫支票，無法兌現，復又派匪孫秋濤至高處交涉，當被警員拘獲。供出同黨匿居鉅鹿路一五〇號，經警員按址馳往，拘獲辛若雷，魚浩然，陳嘯雲，辛天雨，丁又丁等五名，繼赴塘沽路文昌里卅號抄出手槍三枝，匣子槍一枝，子彈廿一粒及臟物金戒一只，偵訊時辛若雷竟自稱係中統局組長，而魚匪則為副秘書，惟經警局向中統局調查後，知全係假冒，該案昨已偵查完畢，各犯對冒用中統名義及搶劫錫成煙紙店不諱，所有槍械係由在逃之黃金滿所供給，故已於昨日移送地檢處。</h3>

<p>原料不源不暢　麵粉廠中止發配　吳市長今日召集代表談話　舊曆年關內議價不能變動　　〔本報訊〕本市早豐，福新，華豐，裕通等五大麵粉廠，自去年八月間，純洽定每日按議價由麵粉商業公會記售本市切麵等業麵粉一萬二千包後，實行以來，尚無間輟。惟各廠近以原料來源不暢，麵粉每包生產成本，已逾二萬七千先。而議價則仍維持每包二萬元，虧蝕頗鉅。本月七日，裕通麵粉廠以缺貨關係，對每日應攤配之麵粉一千一百四十包，忽告中止發配。八日起，華豐麵粉廠應攤之一千三百廿包，亦停止發配。惟麵粉商業公會，以每日一萬二千包之配售量，早經按各業之需要，分別酌定分配額。此中計餅　業四五七四包，切麵業四八六四包，饅頭業四八八包，麵包餅千業九〇五包，酒菜館業五〇〇包茶食業二〇〇包，其他四六九包。故每日需待領粉發配，不能一日中輟。麵粉商業公會當於昨日下午五時許推派代表往市府晋謁吳市長，面陳粉廠中止配粉經過。吳市長當告以數日前當局已有洋粉十六萬包，廉價撥供各廠配售，並囑各廠維持麵粉每包二萬元之議價。舊歷年關內，切不能騰漲。故各廠停配，殊有未當。渠決於本日上午十時四十分，召集各麵粉商代表談話，俾便會　　又據某麵粉廠負責人語記者：五大麵粉廠以原料取給因難，自去年八月十九日開工迄今，虧蝕之數，已逾廿億元。目前最不合理之現狀，即無錫，常州，鎭江，南京等生產原料區，對小麥及麵粉均不限價且可自由出口，而太市產粉所需之小麥，目前須仰給於上述各生產區，尚須負担運費，利息耗損，故成本原包較各生產區地高。然太市仍有二萬元之低　限價，且禁止出口。各廠在賠蝕之處境中，生產量遂告日漸减少，據告目前產量，僅及全部生產量百分之十五云。央行臨收力售　金價始被壓低　　烚赤昨以實力派及擁有餘資者，吸胃仍健，縱有央行屢施壓力，亦難遏買氣，過程多盤，臨收央行力售，隔日交易始告屈服，晨開三七八萬左右，開後曾喊高至三八二萬，始有央行壓力，廣帮中人亦多套賣，曾回跌至三七四萬，而後告定，十時後，央行以三七八萬之價，配給七十條，此後由平漸穩，近午時回漲到三八四萬高價，而後求供稍形均衡，午刻在三八三萬左右盤旋午後央行一再猛售，疲莫能興，臨收時和平空氣忽高，復以低價結束，結果較前收回跌八萬五，飾金掛低至三十八萬六，銀元平平，暗拆銀根尚平，息價仍一角半左右。　　外幣昨無特色，報載全國商會請求廢止外幣買賣之訊，買戶見淡，美鈔晨初六七〇〇元左右，低價退至六五五〇元，後以金價見秀，回升至六七〇〇元盤旋，午後隨金價而回低至六五〇〇元，結果較前收回跌三五〇元。港票曾升至一三五〇元，後以低價結束，結果較前收回挫二十元。公債旋　　公債昨盤旋而已，統丙晨開二〇五〇元，三〇四室有售，而退至一九〇〇元以下，五五〇室三六〇室等來進，而回漲至二一五〇元，臨收徘徊，結果較前收漲七〇元，甲乙平平，丁升五〇元，戊種亦漲一〇〇元，成交的五百萬元。奮曆年關在邇　行莊核結透支　　本市各商業銀錢行莊，以舊曆年關在邇，對於往來客戶透支，自即日起已辦理核結手續，所有貸欠之各戶，催即歸還，並限制　支。復興建設軍需公債　昨日抽籤還本　　財政部三種公債還本抽籤，昨晨九時在仁記路七十四號六樓舉行。　　一，民國廿五年復興公債，此項公債定額爲國幣三萬四千萬元，自廿五年八月起開始還本，每年還本兩次，截至卅五年七月，第廿一决還本止，已還本金五千八百四十八萬元，此次爲第廿二次還本，計抽籤十八支，總金額爲六百十二萬元。　　二民國廿八年建設公債第二期債票，此項債票，定額爲國幣三萬萬元，自卅一年一月開始還本，每年還本兩决，截至三十五年七月第十次還本止，已還本金一千五百六十萬元，此次爲第十一次還本，計抽籤十支，總金額爲三百萬元。　　三，民國三十年軍需公債第一期債票，此項債票定額爲國幣四萬萬元，自卅二年七月起開始還本，每年還本兩次，截至卅五年七月第七次還本止，已還本金六百八十萬元，此次爲第八次還本，計抽籤五支，總金額爲在二百萬元。全國棉紡聯合會　舉行會員大會　　〔本報訊〕由華臣國機器棉紡織工業同業公會聯合會，於昨日下午五時許，假本市江西路中國紡建公司會議室，召開各區會員大會，由束雲章主席，到蘇·浙·皖·重慶·西要·昆明·河北等各區代表，計廿餘人，討論至七時許，始告散會，當決議：（一）設置全國紡織染實騐研究機構，推李升伯·張文潛·陸紹雲·唐星海·祁棣活等五人擬具計劃，（二）購置會所一案決加緊進行。平價煤球　十四日開始發售　每戶只限購一担　　市社曾局煤斤價格審議委員會第五次會議，對本市民用煤球，擬訂發售辦法多項，茲擇要如後，（一）日期規定自一月十四日起發售，至一月二十一日（夏曆年終）稱爲第一期，配售煤球每噸二十二萬元，每担一萬一千元。（二）住戶購買煤球應以藉牌爲憑，每戶不得超過一担，購時各煤球零售商應在戶籍牌上蓋章並加蓋戶長私軍以備抽查。生產事業貸款審委會　昨核准貸款十餘起　　〔本報訊〕四聯總處生產事業貸款臨時審核委員會，第十一次例會，於十日下午四時在中國銀行大厦會議室舉行，由該會霍主任委員亞民主席，到李馥蓀·徐寄廎·秦潤卿·趙棣華·歐陽崙·谷春帆·林鳳苞·蔡公椿等二十餘人，通過貸款案件十餘起，核准貸款三十餘億元，六時散會，又該會對市商會建議放寬押品尺度及簡化申請手續二點，亦予考慮，並已即席議定復函，此外絲織業請求變通貸款辦法一案，亦經該會討論，咸以全滬織綢機開工者共四千台，其中二千四百台係織外銷綢，已由國家行局另訂供給原料，貸給工資等協助辦法，正在積極進行，至織內銷綢織機一千六百台，該會爲協助起見，亦經准由各廠洽請中交兩行核轉該會辦理。　　聞該會對中小型工廠貸款申請書表格式簡化後，昨日前往索取者，一日之間發出千份左有，又該會爲便利貸款申請人所設之問詢處，每日前往詢問者絡績不絕。貸欵和談雙重影響　景福新光先後漲停　　華股昨晨開時時因一五二號之力抑而見低盤，開後即告見秀，七六號導稍進而趨漲，二二四號一八〇號二二號四七號尚售，遞交退至六七四元，一四號七八號一九六號七六號一五二號一四五號來進，同漲到七〇〇元外，二二號八九號一七一號一五四號一七號有所脫手，又見盤低至六七五元光景，七六號出後急入，二二六號一四五號一九七號來進，重又拉上，一八六號先出後進，一九六號八九號一六〇號一五二號一四五號八三號八五號紛購，金市重振，近午漲到七一八元，一九八號一五二號一七一號等逢高脫手，午刻在七〇五元左右掙扎，結果較前收計永紗美亞華豐微升，勤興微挫，景福尚平，新光漲一成弱，信和跌半成，遞交永紗華豐微升，信和勤興跌半成，新光漲起一成不到，午後僅現貨交易，一九七號二〇三號有納，上塲見高，二一八號六一號一五二號八三號一八六號均售，跌風又起，盤低至六九〇元左右，一七號一四號有納，升至七百元外，一六〇號一八六號二二四號尚有賣胃，而降至六九五元以下，三時後逐漸盤穩，一八六號八七號猛購不已，一六〇號等咸納，市傳美亞獲得大批貸款，以及和謠之訊，景福首先由二〇四號進至停板，新光亦由一五四號抬至漲停，美亞臨收漲停有交易，永紗遂猛升至七二〇元高價，臨收轉盤，結果較前收計永紗華豐升半成弱，信和微升，美亞景福新光各漲一成半，遞交僅上午半天交易，永紗華豐微升，信和勤興跌半成，新光漲起一成弱，冷股中絲內衣各升一成餘，商務水泥升半成，餘者升降俱徵。　　外股昨上塲時倍見堅定，但高後不能特久，怡紗仍有北幫吸納，收後又形扳高，大勢多盤，結果較前收計業廣升半成，餘者升降俱徵。汽油限制使用　　若現有之情形不變，中國今後之石油，將嚴格限制售出，自行政院輸入品管理委員會成立後。汽油進口即受限制，因此負責全國油料分配之機構，不得不限制使用。至於各機關及軍用汽油，可逕向油料分配委員會申請代購，該會分配程序，首先撥與各機關之有緊急用度者，次則運職至全國各地，供用當地需要，再次則爲各公司之門市銷售。綠茶脫手順利　　洋莊茶市，安化新紅成交减遜，行情則再度進展，至於抽珍珍眉，則脫手依然順利，尤以品質較佳之陳貨，實氣更盛，售價堅秀，紅綠茶內銷，客帮各路迄鮮回甦，同時本街店莊邊於農歷年關漸將屆臨，銀根勢被抽緊，因此亦無添納之意，是以交易久居凋蔽，人心荏弱不堪。玻璃絲襪傾銷下　本市襪廠沒落　　頃據本市針織製據工業鉅以子對記者稱，本市該業廠商，共計五百餘家，去年營業，極度衰落，究其原因所在，因該業之製成品全賴各地實銷，去年因受內戰之影饗，交通梗阻，銷路中滯，然本市實銷自一月至六月尚屬不惡、迨六月以後，由於美貨玻璃絲襪，大批輸入，且售　尤廉，批發價每打僅十六七萬元，而國貨橫機絲襪，每打需十六萬元，是故整個市塲幾爲玻璃　襪所獨占，且上海人類多好奇，對於國產絲襪頗多捨棄，致使全市襪廠一噘不振，無法維持大量生產，紛綏緊縮或減低工資，雖勞方能諒解資方之苦衷，順利接受資方之要求，每日勉力開工二三小時，但至年終，大部份廠商（約佔全數三分之二以上）仍難維持，聞該業中之大型廠商，中國，泰記，勤益，　安，福康等十家，現已停工。外貨充斥原料缺乏　三紙廠停閉　　據本市造紙業負責人談稱：該會原有會員廿六家，現因營業之不景氣，自動停閉者有大國，大陸，海峯三家，其原因乃爲目前原料甚爲缺乏，尤以木漿爲甚，木漿本依賴於東北，現因交通不使，無法運滬，同時國外輸入甚少，故成價高而不易購得，生產亦受限制，同時因外貨充斥，國貨低劣，不能與之競爭，故會員中經常開工者甚少云。民營紗廠請購國棉　紡管會接洽貸款　第一步擬先購蘇北粗羢　　〔本報訊〕紡管會近以民營紗廠中，有申請購買國棉者，特於昨日下午四時許，召集若干民營紗廠代表，假本市江西路中國紡建公司會議室，舉行談話會，到束雲章·李升伯·吳味經·唐星海·祁棣活·劉靖基·及該會業務處長劉文騰等。討論經過，各民營紗廠·均願意收購國棉，決定先由各廠填報所需之國棉量，作一集體統計，並組設聯合收購國棉機構，俾便集體收購，同時並由紡管會向四聯總處洽購棉貸款。聞第一步將先計劃收購蘇北所存粗羢棉花的五六十萬担。又在可能範圍之內，對上海附近八縣所產之火機花，亦將考慮收購云。煤市交易淸稀　　煤市趨勢尚爲平穩，市塲大批交易極爲淸稀，僅小額堆星交易點綴，蓋時近歲暮，買賣均呈觀望，咸抱一動不如一靜，藉以安渡歲尾。配貨滿場兜售　紗市欲漲無力　　昨日紗市欲漲無力，最初人心榮欣，各支喊價殊高，然實銷寥寥，而市上草包念支紗汗牛充棟，蓋複製業各廠之配給貨，滿塲兜售，買客稀少，致復回落，結果榮辱互見，大致與前日相仿。柏油漲風已戢　總結帳時期漸近　收盤前無甚上落　　柏油自歲尾猛漲時，各產地均風起雲湧，而漲勢最勁者當推浙西嘉興一帶，本軍柏油時僅一週，竟加起五萬元，聲勢之盛，無與比倫，因地鄰蘇滬，貨可朝發夕至，製燭用者取其便捷，辦者易於　集，故漲風亦最早而最勁，南油如金華蘭溪等處，北油若漢口均受響應，惟漲勢較緩耳。金蘭則加起四萬元稍弱，漢柏尚祗三萬而已。初以爲年關後各物尚有漲風，無如開關幾日，各種市面均趨平定，而各處柏油之漲風亦漸戢。至於本市各行，先因售數過多，以致現油奇缺，嗣向各處採辦，次第見到，現雖售出之數尚朱解淸，而辦成之數，均已足額，近日添辦者已少，但待貨到解淸，即可有餘。查各行辦而未到之數頗不單薄，且結帳之期已近，均將結束，市面亦勢將穩定，以待收盤。各行售盤與年底相彷，禾本柏油十八萬五千元，內坪柏油十七萬八千元，獨砠柏油十七萬四千元，的千柏油十七萬元，插雪柏油十七萬元，尖麻柏油十六萬六千元，普通麻城十六萬元，雙聯柏油十六萬元。呢羢市況疲滯　　呢羢沛面，邇來已屆日暮窮途，陽關已過，陰關迫近，銀根不鬆，講倒收閉改組之聲，不絕於耳，除少數門市帮眞有實力者，暗中搜吸春季淡色花呢外，餘均一無交易。標準行情因此祇除春季需銷之西裝與袍料花呢趨堅向榮外，餘均全部下降。駱駝羢因羅宋　去路已停止，銷售驟滯，海自龍長毛羢·平厚呢·大衣呢等，銷令已逝，賣買雙方俱欲斬出，結果祇有賣聲而無買訊，麥爾登因出到頗充兼以實銷之日亦短，同時川帮及各囤戶源源塞出，市價亦見江河日下。　　又訊，據某呢羢號稱：最近呢羢又有到貨，均係上年所定，多爲春季服料，陰暦年內，呢羢事實上已無若何交易，客帮貨物多已辦齊雜滬回里，市上交易，更見淸淡。大美輪船公司　第一艘貨輪抵滬　　〔本報訊〕美商大美輪船公司，在滬設立分公司後，第一艘貨輪斯窩司摩號，已於前日抵滬，現泊日

<p>武當山頭的祖師爺　秦嶺頂上的楚霸王　李先今西竄之謎  鄭州一月三日航訊　本報駐鄭記者范世勤　　前共軍中原軍區司令李先念。從改爲豫鄂陝邊區游擊司令以後，究竟到那裏去了？還是一個謎。李先念從豫南光羅地區西竄之後，到了陝鄂邊境，渡過丹江，至今半年，還無確息，有的說他陣亡了，有的說他失踪了，也有說他化裝潛逃到延安了，也有說他還隱匿在秦嶺伏牛山裏。到底怎樣？還是個謎一樣的事。　　李先念帶着三五萬的人馬，實行西竄，也是可稱浩浩蕩蕩的「長征」。他的抱負可也不小，大槪他想做武當山頭的祖師爺，秦嶺頂上的楚覇王，伏牛山間的宋大哥。然而，那些地方眞是地脊民貧，惹大的人馬，一到那兒，就是不被國軍網羅，也將被這窮山惡水中的魑魅魍魅困疲。不說旁的，就是：要到武當山上去，非得四肢着地學着狗兒上屋不可；要到秦嶺山頂，非得在這八十九條約螺旋道上打轉幾天不可；到要伏牛山裏，非得在一星期中每天橫過四十餘道河流不可：這就够李先念受了。所以在他西竄之中，他的士兵紛紛投誠，其第一句話，「先給我飯吃再設」。確實的，那時國軍有着完備的補給綫，有時尙且還要靠飛機去投糧。　　可以掙扎下去，總想掙扎下去。李先念渡過丹江以後不久，就成立了豫鄂陝軍區，下設五個軍分區，同時另成立武當軍區，下設四個分區；前者準備在秦嶺與伏牛山間地區活動，後者準備在老（河口）白（河）公路兩側活動。馳騁於這山山之間，稱雄於這茫茫之鄕，也是不得意中的得意事。豫鄂陝邊區二十九縣區之內，大概都有他們的足跡，不過始終沒有踏進過一個縣城。　　野心不小　　延安方面曾經命令過李先念，到他在商維一帶與該地「地下軍」連繫，奪取秦嶺，切斷陝鄂間交通，並要他勾結陝南的綠林，同時煽動民衆，準備北取潼關，西出藍田，以配合陝北共軍，奪取整個陜西。『天下形勢算長安』，這樣一來，不是天下形勢在握了嗎？長安該是不遭殃的，抗戰中敵人千方百計打算取長安，但是終於未售，當然共軍千方百計來打算也是不可能的。　　現在共軍豫鄂陜軍區之下的第一軍分區吳世安，第五軍分區的王安山兩部完全垮了，那而武常軍區也只有二三人了。　　但從另一方而說：李先念也有成就的地方。譬如在其西竄後第一個政策收編土匪，確實做到。像藍田匪首王烈當了他的渭·華·藍·維·商·五縣的總指揮，像雒南匪首龔得芳當了他的秦嶺第二軍分區司令，其他匪首常旅長團長更是不少。其第二個政策，就是「建立地方政權。」肴他的計劃，也有他的辦法，但是沒有完全實現。譬如：預備在盧氏·洛寗·　實·陝縣一帶成立根據地，劃分三個縣中心區，官道口以西爲盧靈縣，官道口以南爲盧洛縣，在木桐溝成立雒盧縣。這是他的計劃之一。其辦法，譬如：地畝稅年收稻殻一斗五升（或三千元，或土布一丈五尺，或棉花三斤），行商稅·營業稅等比前核減百分之二十至五十，（但所借的不在內），鄉公所以下機構以准調解案件，擴火地方自治，歡迎外人參加，敎育機關不駐軍等，可是在事實上都沒有表現出來過。　　披狐狸皮　　要說明他標榜的辦法，與其實際的行動。在他最近給人家的兩封信上可以看出來，其一西安一個中學從鄭州賑了一批藥品去，在半途中遭李先念的部隊刦去，留下一封信，說；「這藥品我們很需要，我們沒有地方去買，所以借用了；本來我們想給你們一些代價，可是我們手裏也沒有這款子。」其一是寫給雒南一個地方士紳的，說：「務必請先生效古人徐庶，多給照顧！請減輕人民痛苦，不危害共軍人員，不迫害協助共軍之民衆………否則先生生命財產難以負責保護。」世界上有狐狸披着老虎皮的事情，自然也有老虎披着狐狸皮的事情。　　風雲一時　　但是，李先念在這幾年，也可算華中風雲的人物。武漢被敵淪陷以後，李是從延安帶着幾十個幹部到了溝竹，同王老漢一起辦了一切敎導大隊，人槍四五十人，後來尙不和張學詩合夥，當時高敬亭被殺，李就唱湖北共軍武力整編的調子，編了一個縱隊，號稱六團，到了新四軍事件發生，李又獲機緣升了新四軍第五師師長，偸襲了鄂東保安第四團，吞併了僞軍汪步靑，擴充了十三十四十五三個旅，於是成立了軍分區，保安司令部以及豫鄂區邊行政公署。原來還是豫鄂邊區黨務委員會的書記長，鄭位三從延安派來後，他退居爲副書記長。他的出身，也有說是做木匠的，也有說他是一向在共軍裏的。這也不必管他，但這次他西竄後，確實行踪不明。他渡了丹江，不至於陣亡，因爲這以後國共方面就沒有大接觸；眞的陣亡或是失踪的話，他的部隊也許會整個瓦解；化裝去延安與隱匿在秦嶺伏牛山裏較爲可靠。現在李的行踪有着落了，說是在蘆氏西南的玫瑰樹村之下，那末可知他是隱匿了一個時間，關於他去延安，也仍有傳設，還說他去過兩次，一次說他化裝一個國軍少將模樣過去的，一次化裝商一個商人模樣過去的，但這都是傳說而已。無論李先念如何有分身隱身之術，然而他的西竄大勢注定其失敗了。延安方面最近決定把他調到華北去。這很有可能性，因爲延安方面把原來決定以華北爲掩護建立東北西北根據地，把根據地建立成熟後，撤退華北（連延安在內）；更改爲建立東北西北根據地，同時加強華北根據地。　　渡河之夢　　李先念現在大槪還有一萬多人，其中多半是當地收編的土匪。這些土匪，當然不想帶去，因爲那筆擾亂的資本還得放在秦嶺伏牛武當之間。那末他得帶了些親近的部隊去渡黃河，這渡黃河的企圖，是有過幾次的，可是，到隴海路旁，就被趕回去。他原來想把其餘第一縱隊第三旅閔子堅部第八團汪世騁部，及第六團一部，連同河南軍區司令黃林率同的隨縣地方團隊改編的獨立團及幹部訓練隊四千餘人飛越黃河。現在倒要看他加何再竄了。張家口大境門外的市場　（本報記者攝）北平市政展望  何思源　　在中國的著名大都市中，如謂南京爲中國政治的心臓，上海爲中國經濟的神經，則北平可謂爲中國文化的靈魂。北平爲蘊藏中國新舊文化最豐富的都市，擁有歷史上的榮譽與特色，更爲元明淸三代的首都。至今猶保存若干之優美風景與輝煌建築，同時北平更爲敎育機構的集中地。此間有社會名流專門學者，終歲孳孳爲文化學術而努力。因此北平不僅爲國人足以自豪之都市，北平一語，且爲國際間最具誘惑性之名詞。正以其具有如此偉大的縱橫價值，故余自奉長斯市以來，於欣惑之餘，幾無日不深自警惕，以期無負此世界名城和時代所賦予的使命。　　淪陷期間之北平　　自數寇內犯以來，此國際名城，不幸竟淪胥八載。自今觀之，外貌雖未受顯著的破壞，然敵寇所加予之內在的無形的摧殘，直至勝利後一年的今日，北平的元氣，仍未能恢復舊觀。無論經濟文化道德以及社會組織，靡不創巨痛深，驟難挽救。蓋在長期淪陷中，人民生　水準急劇降低，所有一切生產機構經濟動脈人力物力，均遭極端的壓榨與破壞。是以民窮財盡，生機索然。至於原有文化設施與組織，亦被摧毀殆盡，使靑年德性與心理，由苦悶而消極，由消極而徬徨紛歧，以致於墮落。自亦不免，其更甚者，則爲敵僞公然　　，　我市民，於北平之經濟道德破壞允鉅。故務利後的北平，雖風貎依然，夷考其實，已百病叢生矣。　　勝利後之北平　　勝利後的北平，本需極度的休養生息，本應迅速復員，然最大之不幸，則爲又遇一新生的危機，使此名都，直接間接受到極嚴重之影響。　北平爲一文化都市，非以工商業而繁盛。故凡百市民所需，均仰給於外埠及其四鄕。今由於交通阻滯，四郊多壘，不惟市民生活必需品之輸入維艱，即工商業以及復員所用之物資，亦復不能源源運入。因此市民生治益困，工商業益趨蕭條，並以四郊外縣難民人境者多，市民日　物品亦復愈見增益，節用不可，開源不能，於是市民之生活負担，無形遂更加重。更以四團之環境欠佳，奸匪未靖，其於市民精神之擾害允難言喩。坦白言之，勝利後之北平，名義上雖屬光復，實際上其內心精神上的痛苦與物質上的困難，較前更甚，言念及此，無任痛心。　　今後之北平市　　　今後之北平，亦即計劃中或希望中之北平，將如何發展，實爲吾人之職責。余一向主張爲政在少設話，多做事，蓋與其言而不行，母寗做而不說，較爲切實。不過若干事體，在着手之先，須有計劃，方能按步就班，奔赴目標，以達　預期之效果。否則有如無舵之卅，無韁之馬，將無所適從。茲姑以個人審籌熟慮所得，約略一談，以就教以關心平市之同胞同志，並藉以自勉。　　關於平市施政工作之目標要點有二：（一）爲恢復舊有基礎（復員），（二）爲建立新的基礎（建設），循此二者，以達建設自由民主康樂之北平市之最終目的。至於工作之重點，可分三段：（一）自卅四年接收至今，可再分爲兩個階層，第一，接收整理（側重接收），第二，整理建設（二者並重）（二）本年（卅六年）仍爲整理階段，將側重建設。（三）建設目標：「自由，民主，康樂」求三民主義在北平具體的實現，在工作實施上的原則：（一）依據中央法令，參酌地方情形，來辦理復員工作，俾人民能迅速得到休養生息，國家迅速走上建設坦途。（二）針對敵偽對我實行之政治經濟各種侵略之遗毒，以改正市民心理思想及生活上的不良習慣。（三）整理發揮被敵僞壓抑已久之生活力與組織力，以應付當前的困難。（四）整理修補被敵僞摧殘一切有形事務。（五）簡化行政手續，革除一切陋規。（六）完成地方自治。（七）發展地方經濟。　　關於實施工作之要項，除余在平市臨時參議會所發表者外，茲再略加說明如次。　　（一）關於民政方面：除編組保甲，訓練自治人員，整理人民團體爲基層要政，須依照法令竭力進行外，尤要者爲應切實注意民間之疾苦，隱痛，與夫人民之希望與要求，務期做到，「民所好者好之，民所惡者惡之」之地步，使市行政人員，能與人民打成一片，達到官民一體之目的。　　（二）關於敎育方面；除必須實現的，修整校舍及設備，調整經費，及敎職員待遇，提高敎職員素質，改善課程之外，更着重於增設國民學校，增設臨時中學，收容失學靑年，及掃除文盲運動。蓋北平旣爲文化城，爲全國文化區之代表，故北平市民之知識應予普遍提高。按北平市除國立專科以上學校有十餘處，市立專校一所外，現有中學六三處（市私立合計），擁有學生二八六六九人。小學三〇〇處，學生八一二九六人。然在全市一六九五二〇四市民中，現有適於學齡的兒童達十四萬餘人，若以現在就學之小學學生總數與現在全市之學齡兒童相比，仍有百分之四十以上的失學兒童。此實爲文化城之一大　憾。故余認爲增設中小學及掃除文盲運動，爲勢在必行之工作。在卅六度計劃中，擬增中學三校，師範一校，職業一校，根據報部之復員計劃實施之，再就原有中等學校增加中學十五班，師範二班，職業七班，其經費就中央撥發之，暑假流亡靑年講習班經費移用之。此外並擬擴充國民學校九校，以期達到每保一校之最低限度。　　（三）關於財政經建方面；除廢除苛雜，整理稅收，簡化手續，剔除中飽，减少耗費而外，更擬在不加重地方負担，不累及中央的原則下，取之於民，用之於民，而並且要用得其當，一錢作二錢之用，來整理與建設市政。但在平市自治財政收支相差過鉅之今日，（例如九月份之自治收入為五五二四二一一〇六二二元而該月份之支出却爲三〇六六四六〇三二六一〇元每月大致如此）實有無米爲炊，捉襟見肘之感。惟吾人不能因咽廢食，還須努力另關自足之途。此即正在計劃中之自足經濟建設，成敗利鈍，固難逆覩，但願以「但問耕耘，不問收穫」之精神，以試行之。最低限度亦必推行下列各端：（一）設立合作農傷，就各郊區公有土地，先設四處，以合作方式達成改良農業目的，以挽救平市向極落後之農業技術。（二）辦理農貸，協助農民向銀行貸款，作爲購買農具肥料種籽及修　讓壤開塘鑒井等費，藉以扶助農民規復舊業，並促進其生產。（三）增進卵乳魚肉菓蔬之生產，採購優良卵種，使用孵化機，廉價售與農民，以期推廣優良卵種。派員檢查乳塲牝牛，保護優良牛種，獎勵乳牛增殖。利用城內外海池畜養仔魚，保護蕃殖。設立種猪塲，使良稱雜交，以低價售與農民。劃植菓指導區，廉售樹苗，並指導種植。設菜圃於郊區，改良種子，廉售器械及防蟲劑。（四）管理市區園林，成立苗圃，鼓勵民衆造林，發給樹苗，並派員指導栽植。以上各節，均屬最低計劃，期以一年，必皆辦竣，藉收輔助農民增加生產之效。　　（四）關於公用事業：北平公用事業，諸感落後，缺乏現代都市之條件者甚多，在此國家窮地方更窮之窘狀中，無論侈談建設，爲不可能，而欲維持現狀，亦頗費氣力，但各項建設，又不能因窮困而中止，擬於近中聘請專家設計，將平市公用事業，合組一公司，向外國貸款，或吸收投資，以建設新北平，據粗略統計，倘能圓滿完成，其利頗大，當然技術上伕理上尙待縝密研究，但爲久遠計，竊以爲當屬可行。　　（五）關於衛生方面：目前北平衛生方面最大的問題，爲堆積八年而來淸除之垃圾。據可靠估計，約有一百五十餘萬噸。以最近之最大淸除力量計算，每日可運出兩千噸，預計須費時二年，方可淸除。但每日之生產量一千八百餘噸，尙未計算在內，此星星點點，積聚而成之龐然大物，誠令人有望洋興歎之感。但此而不除，北平衛生將無從談起。最近經發動黨政軍民各界合組一淸潔運動委員會，以大家之力量，淸除大家所產生之垃圾，於情於理，均能設得過去。果此項計劃能圓滿完成。半年以內或有淸除希望。此外北平無完善下水道之設置，汚水排除，爲最嚴重問題。欲澈底解決，以北平目前經濟力量，殆幾爲不可能之事。此唯有待於公用事業合組公司實現後，方可一舉解決。　　（六）關於吏治方面：除淘汰浮濫外，盡力洗除會風，整肅官常，培養政治上的新生命，建樹政治上的新作風，期使市府每個行政人員能眞實達到一個現代公務員的水平。至於所有一切社會上，應加改善之習尙，亦須由市行政人員以身作則，率先示範，以轉移一時代之風氣。此外對於選賢任能，激濁揚淸，綜　名實，信賞必罰。亦縣爲今後之中心工作。　　此外關於治安維持，民食供應，市容修整，警衛加强，地籍聲理等等，在人力物力之合理推動運用下，亦均可循序漸進，計日程功，最後尙有一事須爲社會人士奉告者，即本人到任以後，因鑒於一般行政機關，多患頭重脚輕，人林集中於上層，基層政治無人負責。以致中央之良法，善政，僅在公文上逗圈子，行政人負每以能將公文辦好，即算達到任務。爲澈底糾正起見，乃抽調各局處精幹人員，組成一自治輔導團，將力量用到地方上去。現已於十二月十五日正式成立，預期來年北平有一理想的新氣象，最低限度，下邊事情有人問，有人辦理。此稀希望，似乎尙不難做到。　　以上所述，頗覺掛一　萬，卑無甚高，但這幾椿事倩，假使能如預期的計劃，完全辦到，則亦差堪吿慰於國人矣。總之，北平的自然條件與社會條件，有其爲其他都市所不及之處。尤其北平人民奉公守法，誠樸知禮，知識程度高，是非觀念明，更爲政治容易推行的良好憑藉。吾人能與此優秀的一百八十萬市民來服務，實在是引爲愉快的。李德鄰主任以一身繫華北的安危，坐鎭北平，擘劃指導，已成爲華北的安定力量，成爲中國半壁約有力屛障。我們相信在他的領導之下，展望未來，北平是有其光明燦爛的前途的。聊城被圍週年間  一月三日航訊　本報山東特派員麗天　　聊城在共軍硬攻軟困下已整整一個年頭了！城內四萬軍民，在王專員金祥率領下，爲了確保它這一年來的安全，所犧牲的代價是城內半數以上中華民族中最優秀，最忠於民族國家，同時也是最善良的靈魂和生命。而所徼倖剩留下來的萬餘軍民，亦因接濟困難，營養不足，在普遍地患着色盲，腿腫，腹脹，及爛牙床等惡症下，終於苦守一年後的今年元旦，不得不揮着熟淚，忍痛奉命，在國軍掩護下，自動放棄了！　　本來，古往今來，聊城原就爲兵家必爭必守之地。遠在戰國時代齊國伐燕，燕將固守聊城，齊兵攻打三月，迄未得下。明時王淪作亂，圍城九十餘日，城亦屹立。民廿六年抗戰軍興，范故專員築先亦以此爲基地，率領着燕趙十數萬健兒，確保魯西北卅餘縣凡年餘之久，遲滯敵軍渡河，並配合徐州會戰及武漢外圍之戰，重創敵軍，厥功之偉，允足光耀史册，彪炳千古。抗戰勝利後，共黨稱兵割據，由於聊城在地形上不僅控制着魯西大平原，與山東省會濟南輔車唇齒，互爲犄角，同時也成爲共軍冀魯豫邊區的東面門戶，共軍爲攻佔聊城，退旣可以確保冀魯豫邊區東側的安全，進又可以隨時攻掠濟南作竊據三齊的準備，因此聊城之於共軍，在所必攻，故自卅四年八月敵軍投降後，山東第六區行政督察專員兼保安司令王金詳奉命率領全署職員及保安團隊剛剛收復了聊城及屬縣博平·荏平·東阿，而堂邑·朝城·陽榖等尙未收復時，共軍在劉伯誠·宋仁窮·楊勇等指揮下，調集了五萬之衆，就首先「解放」了醫西北的禺城·臨淸·平原·高唐·館陶等廿餘縣，繼續下來，聊城自亦在被解放之列。於是自去年元月二日起，便又集中兵力圍攻聊城及博平，博平於一月五日即被攻陷，而聊城自一月二日起直至十七日止亦晝夜被攻，迄未稍息。自十四日後，共軍攻擊，尤為猛烈。廿餘門迫擊炮，多集中城東南角及西北角猛轟，終於東南角城牆經炮火集中轟擊下，有數處被炮彈轟塌，於是共軍的奮勇隊，緊接着便踏冰爬城，而城牆坍塌處亦遂有一部奮勇隊汹湧爬上，王專員此時在司令部內接到這個電話時，並刻下令除留親隨　士一人外，其餘所有官兵，以致伙依，居民，有槍的帶槍，無槍的拿刀，全部向城東南角增援，終於，在全城軍民一致奮勇搶救下，爬上城頭的共軍一批一批倒落入護城河去了！城牆也就在全城官兵民衆殊死堵戰下修復了！　　血染護城河　河冰一片紅　　共軍屢攻不得下，這時已在停戰令生効以後的第四天（一月十七日），共軍總算暫時停止了攻擊，而這一役雙方的傷亡，至少各在萬人以上，血遍護城河上，河冰盡爲之赤。　　聊城城內除原有軍民的二萬外，其餘原爲魯西各縣因不堪「淸算」「鬥爭」而逃來城內的少數士紳，大多數百耕農佃農等約萬餘人，魯四六兩專員公署及其所屬各縣公敎人員及其子女學生等四五千人，自然王專員的全家老幼亦在城內，他們有鑒於城如不守，勢將全被淸算，悉這鬥爭，與其淸鬥以死，不如與城共亡，加以領導人王專員出身保定八期，戎馬卅年，曾因功擢陛至旅長，對帶兵衛民素著經騐。故城內軍民，皆樂於聽命，追隨抗拒。共軍於攻旣不克後，乃改用軟困戰術，將城週團村鎭，全以部隊把守，澈底斷絕城內外交通，使城外物資，無從內運，而城內軍民，在此種封鎖戰下，自又遭到遠較攻城尤爲慘酷的命運。　　首先發生嚴重間題的便是食糧，消極的辦法只有由專署施行管制，統盤籌劃，但終因缺少積極的外界的大量供應，致在最困苦的時候，城內軍民，每人每天，只供配給到四兩霉爛榖子，藉以裹腹，草根樹皮，早就吃個精光。繼續下來，燃料及衣被也就大費周章，多少房屋的木料都拿來當柴燒了！多少衣被也因破爛而禦寒乏術了！於是隨着到來的便是因寒暖失調營養不足而發生的色盲腹脹，腿腫爛牙床，瘧疾，傷寒等病症因缺乏醫藥致緊跟在病魔後面的便就是死亡了！眼看着一天三十，五十，甚至百餘個地：默默地倒下去了！　　軍總部執行小組爲調解聊城之圍於去年春天曾不避艱險到城內去觀光了一次。由於同為人類的同情心的激發和驅使，他們於目擊着這幅慘極人寰的圍城之民後，決定於第二次前往時，由善後救濟總署加派卡車八輛裝運麵粉千袋，牛奶二十箱並省府慰勞物資前往救濟。但當五月三日車至聊城柬門城郊時，所有救濟物資一律變爲共軍的戰利品，而小組人員除共方代表外，也成了共軍的俘虜，在共軍的「禁閉室」內被「優待」了兩天才被釋放回濟南。　　聊城軍民在如此艱困狀况下渡過了七個月。到去年八月，共軍利用河水暴漲，又決東門外遝河及西門外馬浹河河堤，企圖水淹全城，使城內軍民，盡葬魚腹。差幸上帝憐見，當水位與城根相平時，河水恰也達到了平衡狀態，不但全城未遭陸沉，而城外護城河河面因此竟拓寬至二里而成爲聯城最有利的天然防綫。　　十二月了！這一年中殺冷的季節，聊城外面的護城河因天寒水枯且封凍到　車都可以往來了！這自又予共軍一年中最難得的機會。於是在經過了半月的準備，於十二月二十日晚七時起，共軍又集中精銳萬餘，迫擊砲十餘，野砲一尊，再度攻城。城內萬餘軍民在埀死狀態中被砲聲所震醒，一種求生的本能和保國衛城的觀念重又喚醒了他們的活力，他她仍舊各守原崗位，支撑了這最艱苦的十一天，至本年元且日，王司令官耀武所派勁旅X萬攻擊到城邊，才掩護了他她全部安全地撤出了聊城。當晚至荏平，估計三日晚上可抵濟南。總計自去年元月二日被圍，至今年元且突圍止，聊城被圍，恰恰整整一週年。　　聊城棄守了！旅濟聊城同鄕特於二日集體向王司令官耀武請願，要求組織武裝還鄕團，打回老家去。這些多情善感，飽經憂患的刧後餘生，於聽到王司令官叙述他她的祖宗　墓所在之地怎樣地被共軍「解放」，而在目前爲了解救城內萬餘孑遺又不得不忍痛放棄城垣而自城內撤離時，所有的請願老鄉們，都禁不住熱淚盈眶！堅守聊城苦鬥經年之王專員金祥　　（本報特派員麗天寄）</p>

<p>自由談上海尷尬人的職業　大都市的寄生者  建華　　現在上海地方有一種尷尬人，他們旣不是打刧的匪徒，又不是偸盜的竊賊。上不能爲抱台脚的流氓，下不肯做搶冷飯的乞丐。這抓人，他們呌做「孵石蛋」，又名「混茶飯」，因爲他們的生活，是混過一天算一天，混過一年是一年，有的混得身發財發，有的像王小二過年，一年不如一年。他們職業的頭銜，有「燕子窠跑街」，「鹹肉在夥計」，「模特兒掮客」等等名稱。　　燕子窠裏　　烟毒的害處，人所書知，可是沈迷不悟的老搶，還是吞雲吐霧，自掘墳墓。因此，禁者自禁，吸者自吸，而且禁得愈嚴，販毒花樣愈妙。目下上海不畏法的燕子窠，恐怕要在四位數字以上。不過燕子窠的處所，非常秘密，非然客是不容易尋覓的。他們除了熟客之外，還要廣招新的主顧，於是雇用這種尷尬人，來做燕子窠的跑街，有二八拆帳，有一九拆帳，要看跑街的成績而定。前天報上所載，本市浙江北路慈德里四號的燕子窠裏，有吸客十五人，有的住在福建路，有的住在廣東路，………這都是跑街招來的顧客。這一行的跑街，也不是人人可做的，要有跑街的資格，並要得到老　的信託後，纔能够「宣誓就職」。　　人肉市場掮客　　又上海里弄中的某寓某寓，粗看是一家高等的妓院，實際大都是三等娼寮，俗名鹹肉莊，只要有一儸鴇婦出名，領了一張執照，就可以通天的營業了。但這項生涯，非要聘請一二能幹並能會說洋涇浜話的夥計不可。因爲娼寮中，內有十分之七八，自己根本沒有名花的，全靠夥計們去設法招致，有的是常駐的，有的是臨時呌來的，大半做的是拆帳生意，鴇婦與夥計，得十分之六，餘下十分之四，是女角的代價。勝利之初，X永兵來滬時期，是他們的黃金時代。鹹肉莊夥計，有男有女，除招致女角外，還要招徠顧客，身兼數職，工作忙碌，是尷尬人中的紅人。不過像最近各報喧傳本市柳林路竹邨四十九號的張寓，名花吳玲弟，被狎客謀財勒斃的事情，出於他們所意想之外的。假使這狎客是夥計招來的，那就要吃着很大的一筆倒帳了。　　猥褻交易　跑街　　再次說到模特兒掮客，在上海已經成爲强弩之末了。這種掮各的踪跡，火都在永安，先施，大新等各大公司的路旁，他們看見鄉下服裝的土老兒，就跟在你的左右或後面，宣傳怎樣怎樣的好看，價目又如何的便宜，假使你願意去看的話，他就領你到一家小客棧裏，或一家亭子間裹，買好了槳，等滿了四五人，或六七人時，然後再引到一間半明不暗的房中去，讓你觀賞十餘分鐘，即行閉慕。但操這種生涯的，為法律所不許，而且營業冷淡，無不受着倒風的壞擊，另想別法了。　　還有一抓職業，也是這種尷尬人做的，如兜賣鉛筆洋簿　東西，他們跑的是商店或學校，事前撥個電話給對方，假託名人介紹，請店主或校長熱心帮忙等語，對方實因人情難却，雖屬貨劣價昂，總是多少購買一些。其他像端午節的符錄，新年時的春聯，挨戶分送，隔日收錢，這都是尷尬人所玩的把戲。上海橫斷面水上叫化子（下）　水老鼠前身  黃嘉謨　　這許多練習水裏工夫的小孩子們，他們都得保持最大的忍耐，才有成就，就是種種工夫已經練會，能夠保全性命的，又不到半數。所以僥倖不死的男子，年紀只有十七八歲的，却巳經收起徒弟來了。道中也認爲是有本事的人兒，大家都另眼相看改了「游五湖」以後，不似現在的隨便，也須會些雜技。這類有經騐的男子，是最適當的敎師，當傳授技藝時，因爲船頭巳放大了一倍，這才可以放開了手脚做事。　　除掉原有的「耎猴」，「倒鼎」，「風圈」以外，加上武術一類技藝，像「飛三尖」（要鋼叉），「飛皮郎」（要拳頭）等等。「翻頭「（花樣）雖然加多，沒有以前的危險，練起來也平易得多，死傷的也漸漸地减少了。　　這類本要於「水老鼠」一帮，後來爲了幹「水老鼠」營生，大都避難就易，改了本來的行當，去幹「鑽底子」（潛至船艙），「水活鷺」（伏在水中乘機行竊）等水賊的營生，便另立「戲靑　」一個名稱。可是名稱雖換，敗類仍多，白天聆「數靑能」，晚上做「水活鷺」的也很多。據說給官廳禁止的原因就在道點。要不然，死掉了一個要飯的孩子，怎能打動巡撫的慈悲心呢？自經禁止以後，一部份還是靠本行過活的，便又改了名稱另添「翻頭」。把「底子」也改了式樣，谷抓危險得過分的也减少了些。使孩子的性命，比較保穩一點。這並不是眞的尊重孩子們的性命，實因敎一個孩子或功不很容易，如果輕輕易易的死掉了，再要敎一個出來，又是多少年才得有希望。　　在當初「水老鼠」並不屬於丐頭所管，而是歸看守水柵的柵夫所統轄。「底子」一到了柵口，應向柵夫報帖，奉行拜見的手續，方才可以放進柵去。獻技所得的錢，　夫至少要抽取二成，後來就改作包帳，一次給付若干。柵夫原屬更夫一類，所以對「永老鼠」也有權管轄。這都寃枉了那些眞正靠　技為生的一些可憐虫了，因爲如逢到失　者　來追究，此輩往往給　指爲賊。那時鑲正的水賊早已溜出了　口了。至於現在的「游五湖」，祇把一隻底子盪來　去，向人乞錢，已經沒有什麼工夫可言了。　　「水梳通」，是一種捉漁的人們。這類人大都姓朱，據說是明太祖的遺族，被逼做了船。這和「蛋戶」是一樣被虐待着的族類，不准登陝或和陸上人婚媾，也編入了丐戶。爲了生活的困苦，他們祗得努力於他們的捕漁的專業。他們都須自備各種捕魚的器其，如在冬天入永捕魚，還得備一件「滑水」。（皮製衣服上下相連，僅留一頭部生外。便於入水之用）。外加—應捕魚用具設備，成本着實不少。不過一季蟹市，和全年的魚市，利息甚厚，頗可以維持生活。　　自長江中流逐漸流佈到上海來的，「游五湖」帮，不走正路而走上歪路，蛻變至今，成爲無惡不作的「水老鼠」帮。貽害於碼頭江面，使行旅船戶商販莫不談虎色變，切齒痛恨一　　兒童行為專家的意見　孩子不宜多睡  家源譯自本月號「雜誌文摘」　　做父母的人，假如硬呌孩子早睡，（或多睡），結果會損害孩子的健康。　　根據兒童心理學家最近研究結果，證明早睡對於兒童有害，除非你明晨准許他（或她）早起。睡在牀上過久會使孩子的神經失常。　　倘使做父母的人，迫使兒女睡得過久，那麼不同年齡的兒童，會發生種種不同的反映：　　（一）嬰孩會高聲哭鬧。假如他（或她）在日間多睡了一小時，晚間必哭無疑。不明此中眞相的母親們，往往以爲孩子的胃腸中不舒服面未能探索到多哭的眞正原因。　　（二）剛學走路的兒童，也會因多睡而哭鬧，不安靜，將頭部亂撞以至找尋其他的消遣，如食手指，玩弄生殖器及遺尿。　　（三）學齡兒童會因多睡而說夢囈，夜行，患遺尿症。　　以上的結論，是英國著名兒童行爲專家麥古魯斯基博士經多時研究後所獲得的。　　應該睡多少時間　　究竟兒童每天應該睡多少時間呢？根據麥博士的意見，要看兒童的年齡而定，初生一月的嬰孩除喂乳的時間，應睡足二十四小時，十一歲的孩子每天睡十小時。茲將嬰孩每日應該睡眠的時間，列表如次：　　年齡　夜間睡眠時間　　一個月　二十四小時（喂乳時間除外）　　二個月　二十一小時　　三個月　二十小時　　四個月　十九小時　　五個月　十二小時（加晨間三小時，下午三小時。）　　六個月　仝右　　七個月　十二小時（加晨間二小時半，下午二小時半。）　　八個月　全右　　九個月　十二小時（加晨間二小時，下午二小時。）　　十側月　十二小時（加晨間一小時半，下午一小時半。）　　十一個月　十二小時（加三小時）　　十二個月　十二小時（加二小時半）　　前表所規定的時間並非絕對不變的，因爲每一個嬰孩都有不同的習慣，各異的體質，但是相差的程度，每日至多不能超過三十分鐘。例如，假使一個六個月的嬰孩在夜間連續睡了十三小時，那麼就應該在日間應睡的六小時中减少一小時，不過等到孩子逐漸長大起來的時候，他常常會給予母親若干暗示的。　　多睡了便要哭　　但是有一點是非常確定的；假如一個嬰孩的睡眠，照習慣上規定時間多睡或少睡了些，甚至只有十五分鐘或三十分鐘的差別，但是他的行爲上就會發生激烈的變化。一向極順利的孩子，會因少睡了一小時而像一頭小貓那標地咆哮不休。反之，假如一個八個月的孩子，給他睡了六個月的孩子應睡的時間（意即多睡半小時），那麼他一定會呌他的父母在夜間抱着走若干時光。疲乏的母親是極容易呌孩子多睡的，結果反而得不償失！　　學走路的時候　　剛學走路的小孩，其應睡的時間如次：　　二歲　十二小時（加日間一小時）　　三歲　十二小時　　四歲　十一小時半　　兩歲孩子的睡眠，倒是相當難處理的一個問題，原因就爲了日間需睡一小時，。假如他在夜間連續睡了十二時以上，日間的睡眠時間就應該减少至一小時以下，但是一般的母親總希望孩子睡得長久些，以便料理一些家務。實則孩子日間多睡了，夜間必然會打攪父母的淸夢的。　　三歲的孩子更難處理，因爲他醒得太早，而父母總迫着不許他起來。事實上，在這個年齡，健康孩子的睡或醒，猶如鳥類在淸晨一定要歌唱一樣，完全出諸自然，但是許多父母往往橫暴有加，抑制孩子生命活力的衝動。這會使孩子憂愁寡斷，懦弱無能，將來長大成人，難有作爲。　　學齡兒童的睡眠　　學齡兒童的睡眠時間，應該如次：　　五，六，七歲十一小時　　八，九，十歲十小時半　　十一，十二，十三歲十小時　　若干兒童爲父母所迫，不得不獃在床上，睡前或者看一小時光景的書，或者一淸早醒來之後，想東想西。有些發育中之兒童，就連這一點自由也沒有，於是毛病就發生了，性的自賣行爲或者種種不健全的妄想，都由此而起。可是身爲父母還不知自己的過失，還要誇耀自己對於兒童如何如何懂得撫育呢。　　愛護兒童的父母們，對於管理兒童的方法，尤其是睡眠時間的處理，應該多多注意才是。馬歇爾新任命消息十七分鐘到達上海  寗　　馬歇爾元帥繼任美國務卿的消息正式在白宮發表，由美國傳遞到上海，僅費時十七分鐘。最先得到的英文大美晚報，那時還是淸晨七時許。據說，白宮發表時，恰正只有四個記者在座，合衆社記者是其中之一。他立即在白宮將這驚人新聞用無綫電報機（Teletype），傳佈至全美各地合衆社。二分鐘後，舊金山分社接得，當即拍發給上海分社，費時十分鐘。上海分社馬上用電話通知大美晚報，費時五分鐘。前後合計十七分鐘。假若「大美」能出號外，當白宮公布任命的同日淸晨八時，消息便已能傳遍上海了。外交家  春良　　史太林和莫洛托夫在一起的時候，莫洛托夫接到一個從美國國務卿貝爾納斯打給他的電話。　　　『哈羅，具爾納斯先生，』莫洛托夫說，『不………不………絕對不可以………一定不可以………噢，是的！……不！………不！………不！………不可以！』然後，他掛斷了。　　史太林問：『他所說的那一個問題，竟使你回答了是的。』　　『噢！』莫洛托夫答：『那是他問我聽得見嗎？』　　（譯自讀者文摘一九四七年正月號）交通機關來函　七路公共汽車　路綫將予延長　　頃志本月五日　貴報自由談少夫先生對於公共汽車之意見兩點，茲分別奉答於後：　　（一）七路公共汽車本會茲正計劃延長至外灘北京路與南京路間，專闢一正式之公共汽車停車站，容納三四七十等四綫車輛，避免其他車輛之擁塞，一俟實現，七路即以此爲起點。　　（二）十路行車路綫在目前交通情形下欲避免與電車相同之路綫，一時實難選定，如蒙以卓見賜敎，至所歡迎。此致申報自由談編輯部，上海市公共交通公司籌備委員會啓。週末　　（編者按：「週末」是娛樂攔，凡有關于音樂影劇的報導，影星，樂人，藝人的近事趣聞，均所歡迎；請讀者們多多供給這類的稿件！）李世芳之死　劇　　梅派靑衣傳人「小梅蘭芳」李世芳，於五日搭機返平，不幸在靑島附近，機毀人亡，伶界後起之秀又弱一個，不勝悼惜！　　李世芳在科班時即宗梅，後來滬師事梅蘭芳，扮相頗似梅氏，藝則大部爲王少卿所授，直至最近梅氏在滬登台，才得觀摩機會，但以天賦關係，嗓音稍差，故未能如張君秋等之走紅。　　李世芳出科後，首决之打泡戲爲「廉錦楓」，在三慶戲院出演，民三十年初次在滬黃金大戲院登台，其打泡戲亦爲「廉錦楓」，此次遇難前，在滬最後之演出，爲在楊虎公館之「堂會」，其劇目亦爲「廉錦楓」，可謂以「廉錦楓」始終矣。其在黃金首次出演之夕，操琴伴奏者爲王少卿倪秋萍師徒兩氏，其最後一次楊府之堂會，爲之操琴者亦爲王倪二氏，誠不勝巧合之至。　　世芳之得有今日，王少卿提　培植之功最大，得力於王氏之琴者尤多。王氏應梅蘭芳請而南來，世芳遂祇得在平輟演，大有非王譯不可，今次原已的定明春在平合作，今則成爲永別矣。　　世芳所學梅氏諸劇中，以「生死恨」一劇成績最佳，大有靑出於藍之概，唱腔允有獨到處，不意竟眞成爲「生死恨」。　　世芳出演數年，未有積蓄。去夏在天蟾之局，得包銀二千萬元，因在平購屋一橡，款尙不數，此次匆匆趕回北平，乃料理其房屋過戶等手續，人亡屋在，惜哉！　　世芳夫人爲姚玉芙次女，前日梅寓接得北平其夫人寫來一信，上書上海李世芳收，北平姚寄，日期爲十二月卅一日，信方到滬，而人已去世，傷心慘事，莫逾於此。好萊塢愛傳記片　影　　年來好萊塢對傳記片似有偏愛，目前如此，未來兩三年內，也許還是如此，並且製作得也的確不壞，譬如去年演過的「威爾遜傳」，「左拉傳」，「一曲難忘」等，與本週的「居禮夫人」及「幽默磊師」，（馬克吐溫傳），都會獲得一致的讚美。居禮夫人是鐳的發現者。夫婦倆在貧困生涯中，堅毅奮鬥數十年，終於發現了世界史上第一種發射元素，爲原子時代打開了門戶。全片畫面構圖甚美，故事也極感人。　　美國百老匯是舞台戲院的匯集地。近四十年中那裏曾產生過個最豪華最浩大的歌舞大王，便是齊格飛。齊格飛的盛名引起了好莢塢製片家的靈感，競以他的輝煌的歌舞劇，穿插了生平事蹟，攝成影片，以前曾拍渦兩部，最近第三部亦已到滬，定陰曆「元且」在大華放映。它的名字是「錦繡天堂」。　　「軍人魂」是根據美國名記者恩尼派爾的戰地通訊攝成的，裏而沒有輝煌戰蹟或超人的英雄，有的只是美國小兵在戰地上生活的切身苦難：粗爄乏味的罐頭食物，餐風宿露的艱苦，死的威脅，故鄕　孥的懷念——總之極富人情味。　　恩尼派爾業已於一九四五年五月間在火琉球島前綫殉職了，生前曾親自指示「軍人魂」的製作，可是並未等得及它的獻映。音訪團去邊疆　管夫人亦同行　樂　　上海市音樂協會音樂訪問團上日間在平津由何市長思源，杜市長建時贊助之下，演奏達十次，打破平津歷來音樂會之記錄，該團上月廿四晚由平飛滬，廿七日由滬飛漢，在武漢演奏後赴迪化，此行係應新疆張主席治中之邀請，節目除該團馬思宏，吳樂懿，黃源尹担任外，著名女高音管喩宜萱，亦參加云。　　上海音樂界一度蓬勃後，又走向下坡了。春寒料峭中，想音樂界行將「春眠」一下，這自然是暫時的！　　在蘭心舉行一次獨奏（唱）會，塲租便要三五十萬，請有名的伴奏者，每次也得二三十萬，許多單獨表演，是只求名而不求利的！　　市府樂團名指揮馬戈林斯　夫人，生長於維也納，十八歲於柏林音專得榮譽獎，音榮　　固亦不淺，但因年齡已高，歌喉不復圓轉，本月五日在蘭心獨唱時，成　欠佳，不過聽衆爲了對於馬戈林斯基的崇仰，仍然給她許多掌聲。　　市府交警樂團明日下午五時一刻在蘭心演奏，節目有貝多芬「奏嗚曲一等。李世芳與袁海在「別姬」中。春秋李商隱的錦瑟詩  吳素儂　　李商隱的一些抒寫戀情的詩，寫得都非常朦朧，令一個對「本事」不熟悉的後代讀者，無法去徹底了解；有時簡直一點兒也不了解。可是，他的那些「無題」之類的詩，詞藻是那樣美艷，韻律是那麼詣和，意境邈渺而又帶着苦戀的輕微的哀怨。總令人愛不忍釋。很多人讀着那些詩，雖然口中道不出裏面的明確意義，但心靈上却似乎被那些作品激起了共惑，會引起一抓難於抑壓的情思。　　李商隱的詩集中，在抒寫愛情這方面的作品，都認爲除了「藥轉」一首最不可解外，再呢，就是「錦瑟」一首了。詩句是：——　　「錦瑟無端五十絃，一絃一柱思華年。　　莊生曉夢迷蝴蝶；望帝春心託杜鵑。　　滄海月明珠有淚，藍田日暖玉生烟。　　此情可待成追憶，只是當時已惘然！」　　從來一般選詩的，註胖的人，都只能在幾個典故上解說，而不能指明究竟是說的一回什麼事。然而，偏又有很多人爲這首詩的美艷的魅力所迷醉，而追求牠的故事。這裏，我抄下幾個人的意見，雖說還不令我們滿意，可是也，可以作爲我們讀詩一個方法，或一種助力吧。　　有一抓說法是就題解詩。宋代的蘇東坡和張邦基都主張是描寫瑟譜的曲調的·據說古瑟譜有「適·怨·淸·和」四曲，「錦瑟」詩就是依次形容四曲的情趣。張邦基在「墨莊漫錄」中有這麼一則記述：「李商隱錦瑟詩………人多不曉。劉貢父詩話云：『錦瑟，令狐綯家靑衣。』亦莫能考。瑟譜有適怨淸和四曲名，四句蓋形容四曲耳。」他所說的「四句」，是指「莊生曉夢……」和「滄海月明……」兩聯。童思是說「莊生」一句是形容「適」，「望帝」一句是形容「怨」，「滄海」一句是形容「淸」，「藍田」一句是形容「和」。但是，前後還有四句又如何解說呢？那就只好不了了之。這種說法顯然是有「望題生義」的毛病。　　有一種是劉貢父所說的意思，他因爲令狐綯家有一個婢女叫錦瑟，就猜想「錦瑟」一詩是爲她而詠。但究竟爲了什麽要爲她而詠呢？這却又難找根據了。這也是「望題生義」而來。　　有一種說法是指「錦瑟」全詩爲李商隱全稿的自序詩。這册是淸代鄒弢轉記的別人的意見。他在「三借廬筆談」中記下了這麼一則：「玉溪生之詩，不可解者儘多，讀者亦當以不解解之。如錦瑟詩起句，曰『五十絃』，夫瑟絃五十，盡人知之，何以　『無端』也？有傖火謂義山此詩爲斷絃悼亡之作。謂瑟本二十五絃，今無端爲五十，則兩斷矣。自謂獨得妙解。不知如此解詩，是釋籤矣。惟何義門太史解此詩手近理，謂錦瑟詩是玉溪生自題其全稿之作。首二句言平時著述，遽已成集，而一言一詠，俱足追憶生平也。次聯言集中諸詩，或自傷出處；或託　君親；作詩之旨，隱寓於蝶鵑也。三聯言淸辭嚴句，珠輝玉潤，而語多激昂慷慨，又有根柢栽培；所以自明其匠心之巧也。結二句言詩之陳事，雖堪追憶；惟回首當年，無窮悵惘；猶望後之讀其詩者，知人論世，或想見其生平大凡也。……」這中間關於所謂「傖父」的意見，容後再談。至於「自題其全稿」之解釋，說來雖頭頭是道，但我們總難相信一首「自序詩」，會這麼曲曲折折說出來，令人像猜謎一樣。同時，這樣的解釋又多麼勉強，可以說連「釋籤」的見解都談不到。所以這也是應該「存疑」的。　　還有兩種意見；一是說爲傷唐元宗而作；一說是李商隱假物以自傷。這是淸代梁章鉅的「退庵隨筆」裏同時提到的。原文是：「李義山詩，開卷錦瑟一篇，言人人殊。東坡『淸和適怨』云云，亦未見的確。本朝朱長孺注，以爲令狐靑衣，更無所據。惟朱竹垞謂是悼亡之作者近之。方文軔則以爲傷元宗而作。元宗之移入南內也，高力士令李輔國控焉，謂此五十年太平天子；杜樊川詩，亦有五十年天子之句。故發首曰：『錦瑟無端五十絃，一絃一柱思華年』也。曉夢蝴蝶，所謂一塲春夢，望帝社鵑，明指幸蜀。藍田生玉，則反以諷肅宗也。其旨甚明，味之可見。亦可謂善說詩者矣。然猶不若在韓門所釋爲得神理。汪云：按舊唐畫，義山仕宦不進，終身坎　，故開卷錦瑟一首，乃是假物以自傷。漢書郊祀志，『秦帝使素女鼓五十絃瑟而悲，帝禁不止，破其瑟爲二十五絃。』今世所用者，皆二十五絃之瑟。而此乃五十絃之古製，不爲時尙；成此才學，有此文章，即己亦不解其故。故曰『無端』，猶言無謂也。自顧頭顱老大，一絃一柱，蓋已半百之年矣。『曉夢』喩少年時事，義山早負才名，登第入仕，都如一夢。『春心』者，壯心也；壯志消歇，如望帝之化杜鵑，已成隔世。珠玉皆寳貨，珠在滄海，則有遺珠之嘆，惟見月照而淚；生烟者，在在之精氣，玉雖不爲人採，面日中之精氣，自在　田。『追憶』謂後世之人追憶也，『可待』者，猶云必待於後無　也。『當時』指現在言，『惘然』，無所適從也；言後世之傳，雖可自信，而即今淪落，已極可嘆耳。如此讀法，詩中雖虛字亦無一泛設。玉溪壓卷之作，似非如此讀法，亦不相稱也。」我們看了這兩種詳細解說，心中仍然是覺得都太牽强附會。古人本喜歡小題大做；尤其是關係男女戀情的，總設法扯到大道理上去。一部「國風」被註得嚴然神聖，就是好例。因此，這種又像猜謎，又像解釋推背園的咬文嚼字，要人家相信，自然不容易。　　我認爲「錦瑟」這首詩，倒是所謂「傖父」和淸代文學家朱竹垞所說的是「悼亡之作」，爲比較可信。只是鄒弢引的「傖父」的理由，只有解釋五十絃的一點；我們無法知道他還有別的什麼說明。現在我手邊又沒有朱竹垞的全集，也無法翻檢他對這首詩究竟說了些什麼。因此，還難一口認定。從詩的本身去細讀，即算不是蛋亡之意，也就是抒寫的一塲悲劇的愛戀，而都有無限難言之隱。所以不得不用轉灣抹角的字句；而作者本就長於運用典故，長於象徵手法，何况又加以故意的隱諱，自然令人更難懂了。但不論悼亡也好，失戀也好；不論死別或是生離？這首詩可以斷定是「無題」一類的情詩，不會在裏面包藏什麼對人對己的大道理的。從李商隱的詩中，以及一切舊記載中，可以看出他是一位情愛經騐相當多的詩人。可惜我一直沒有找到戰前出版的蘇雪林著的「李義山戀愛事蹟考」，不然，綜合研究一下他的戀愛事蹟，或者會得到一些可靠的證據。這只有等待以後的機會了。　　編者按：「李義山戀愛事蹟老」中，論及此詩，謂義山與宮嬪相　，乃故意隱約其辭。感覺的麻木  叔孫如瑩　　文藝作家必須敏感。一件平凡的事物在藝術家心目中竟無比絢爛。所謂「從一粒微　中看一個世界」，正是這個這理。浪漫主義者崇尙主觀，現實主義者崇尙客觀，不論你崇尙何種主義，運用何種手法，你如要從事於藝術創作，必先從事精淡的觀察，且繼之以體騐的感受，你才能有所見，有所衝動，而釀成藝術的腹稿。　　所謂觀察，所謂感受，必須基於敏銳的感覺之上。藝術家的感覺，不但較一般人爲敏捷，且較一般人爲深刻，如此，他的創作才能有獨到之處，才能給人以啓發。有人稱詩人爲預言家，有人稱作家爲聖哲，就是爲了這個緣故。　　但是，人類的感覺是非常容易麻木的，如不善爲保護，不勤加誘導，則極易陷於麻木之境地而不自覺。嬰兒初生，空氣給他的刺激之大，在我們誠不能想像，亦無法記愧，但嬰兒落地時之啼號可爲其有强度感覺之明證；而在成人，則對空氣的感覺已完全麻木了。這是一個例子。「入芝蘭之室，久而不聞其香」，又是一個例子。對於現實的一切，感覺的强度因經騐之增多而逐漸降低，因此人不能盡爲藝術家，而藝術家亦因此乃異於常人。　　第一次貪汚案出現於世間，舉世人爲之矚目，及至第二次，第三次，乃至無數次食汚案層出不窮時，於是便不再若第一次之轟動遐邇了。在犯罪的人自身，也未嘗沒有類似的情形。第一次扒竊，混身打戰，第二次扒竊，東張西望，第三次扒竊，便心安理得，嘸沒事體了。這是犯罪的感覺的麻木。這種感覺的麻木，是促成社會風氣墮落的原因，足以妨碍社會的安寗與道德的發揚。　　如果感覺的麻木症傳給了藝術家，那麼，藝術便走上了死滅的途徑。最初是藝術品量的减少，不復能供給人類以充分的精神食糧，同時藝術品質貶低，不復能提供鮮明的形效，啓迪進步的思想，而終於逐漸消滅，再走上一個空前的黑暗時代。　　現在，且讓我們看一看當前的中國，感覺的麻木症已傳染了很多人。社會風氣之頹廢，實出人意料之外，貪汚疊出，盜匪橫行。善良人只有忍受，只有沉默，藝術家似亦已爲這麻木症所侵襲，在創作的表現上日益衰萎，反映時代精神的作品允不易多見！　　然而藝術家畢竟是先知。且讓藝術家先從感覺的麻木症裏痊癒吧！先救自己，再救別人，藝術家將重建民族的藝術堡壘，再進而來改造社會風氣！過去  沈企元　　熄了燈，躺在被窩裏。夜是靜靜的。　　突然，在我的頭旁似有一個聲音在響音：　　「哦！我是「過去」。——時間，跟着我快走啊」！　　我的瞑想時所合攏的眼，爲這個聲音所驚醒而張開了。我向四面瞧着，但找不到一些什麼的景子。　　「時間，快跟我走啊！——呃！我是「過去」呀」！　　這樣的聲音又在我床頭溜走；我覺得這聲音似乎是發自我的心底。　　「增去」！這兩個宇使我的身子感到顫抖。　　我的思想開始紊亂了。「過去」所說的話也一連串的在我耳際響着。　　我恐懼了。　　在我的額上，我覺得似乎有什麼東西輕輕地劃了一下；接着一個聲音響起了：　　「我是「過去」，我帶走時間，使人的衰老。——哦！讓我在人們的額上劃上一條「時間」的痕子吧」！　　啊！我恐懼到極點，而恐懼使我忿怒起來。　　我用手向空中用力抓握着，但抓握不到什麼；我又用手指捺住牀褥，可是，依然沒有捺住什麼。於是，我更是忿怒而呌起來：　　「我要捉住你，過去！」　　終於，我是失敗了。忿怒像火在我的心內燃燒不起，恐怖佔住了我身內所有的神經；我，之受了傷的狼，頹然地倒下了。　　於是，我只有嘆息。　　「人生，是那麼容易消逝啊」！河邊的歌  胡牧　　在河邊，蘆葦，雜花，綠茵擁抱的江岸呀，黃土的江岸呀……　　淸早，我常常愛在河邊讀懷鄕詩，讀着杜甫的「劍外忽傳收薊北，初聞涕淚滿衣裳……」的佳句，我更愛看船天們在汚穢的木船上早餐，我看是鴿鴿翔飛在靑空之上，我看見林子裏茅屋掛起了炊烟……　　於是，我怗記着春花三月，雜花生樹，羣鶯亂飛的江南。　　我懷念着那裏的船隻呵！將載來滿處的鄕音……　　洗衣女　　露出雪藕一般的手臂，背影辛勞的佝僂的洗衣女呵，在黎明你們又在溪岸邊來工作了。黎明的大霧，從江上升起一層灰白色。　　從鄰鄰的水紋，汚濁的江水，照出你菜黃色的面龐，我知道生活使你喘不過一口氣。你的兩隻又深湛，又黑亮的眼海，生活使你愛鬱呵……　　雖然，你輕輕的向江水微笑，笑一笑，多麼豐富的靑春呀……　　可是，那滾滾不斷的河流呵！流不盡你的哀愁與淚水……　　茶棚　　河邊，有無數紙糊篾扎的茶棚，一排一排的佇立在岸邊。　　黎明，茶棚的白色的烟突上冒起一縷樓的白烟，此時，茶棚的行人忙碌了。　　於是，茶棚有許多流浪人坐着，談笑着，互相傾訴着生活的悲哀與愁煩，這裏，是無數行人休息的地方，也是大家自由爭論的塲所。自畫像  林白朗　　林白朗（Rembrandt　1607-1669）是被荷蘭人稱爲「國寳」的畫聖。祇要看過電影——「畫聖情痴」的人，對他的一生，多少是有些印象的。　　他善畫人像，色彩富麗而厚重，用筆古拙，允喜表現「光的集中部份。代表作爲「解剖學敎授」，「我與妻」，「夜巡」，「白蔭脫貝」（即妻之裸體）。　　他有個美貌而財富的妻子，精神與物質都得到充份的幫助，乃得大成。可是，好景不長，卅五歲，愛妻薩絲克死去，他就漸漸消沉，飽受了當時封建的攻擊。（獅）一寸山河一寸血144  葉勁風　　出塲做什麼呢？當眞的比拳比劍？那未免太小覷了近衛，拿兒戲玩意來愚弄他。鶴見安能不知道近衛是僵老奸巨猾；拿這種幼稚手法來玩弄他，對於近衛，不僅是「班門弄斧」，簡直是跡近侮辱。鶴見縱令沒看才調，也不能定下這種狗頭軍師的策略。　　說他這着棋是個烟幕，倒不算錯，只嫌說得太凌空了些，不大透澈。他這一段計劃裏，照普通說法，不是「調虎離山」，就是「聲東擊西」。殊不知他這一個子法裏，裏着近乎我國三十六例神機妙算裏，三個高着：一是「無中生有」，一是「打草驚蛇」，一是「托樑換柱」。這三個高着都是舊式名目，可是他只採取了其中菁英，一步一步連環的應用起來。　　這第一步無中生有，那只是看穿了近衛的心理，知道他在貪功　權，想做一個歷史上的英雄，要做到這種英雄，惟一的着手方法，就在收羅人才，竹頭木屑也好，破銅爛鐵也好，多收一個人才，就算距離成功更進了一步。因此就計劃了綠野社投函對鶴見挑　的這一回事。同時，不僅近衛一人喜歡所謂武士道行爲，日本全國，從小學一年級起，就有柔道劍道，列入課程，養成了武士道就是大和魂這抓尙武好鬥的習性。所以挑戰一事，不僅是日本時尙，近衛要是一隻狗，這一着就算是對他投下了一塊帶肉骨頭。換句話，就是投其所好。　　那第二步打草驚蛇，新式說法就是放烟幕。這烟慕的目標，就在驚動近衛手下各種各色的特務人員，秘密團社，讓他們大驚小怪，疑神疑鬼，一番騷動，而實際上，却是集中自己手下的全部精銳，一面進行搜尋地下室工作，一面在外來往晃動，製造混亂的空氣。這種混亂的時間，也不必太長，只須這們二三十分鐘，也足矣够矣。那〇三號的攝影手段，輕靈敏捷，况且還有一兩名內行助手，從旁帮忙。</p>

<h3>Researching Negotiation Methods; Sun Fo, Zhang Qun, and Others to Return to Nanjing in Two or Three Days; U.S. Ambassador Paid Visit to Chairman Last Night for Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Zhizhong spoke on the anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference, saying that he is not pessimistic about the future of peace talks and that it only depends on our efforts. As for the resumption of peace talks, there are currently three approaches being considered: (1) Negotiate first, then reorganize the government; (2) Reorganize first, then negotiate; (3) Conduct both simultaneously. This will be decided after Zhang Qun arrives in Nanjing. The content of the peace talks cannot yet be discussed; the first thing worth studying is the method. He expressed his admiration for Marshal Ma's past efforts to promote peace. Zhang visited Qi Biwu on the 9th, but he was out. On the evening of the 10th, he attended a dinner hosted by the Soviet Ambassador and scheduled a press conference for 5:00 PM on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Shao Lizi said on the morning of the 10th that he only learned from the newspaper today that the government would send someone to Yan'an. As of speaking, the question is only whether it is feasible because the government has not yet understood the intentions of the Chinese Communist Party. Shao said in a firm tone: Peace will inevitably come; the only question is what method to use to make it happen sooner.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is said that the plan for the government to send someone to Yan'an was suggested by a certain neutral diplomatic figure. Shao Lizi stated that he had not heard of it. Many believe Zhang Qun might be chosen.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] U.S. Ambassador Stuart visited the Chairman at 9:00 PM on the evening of the 9th for half an hour. On the morning of the 10th at 10:00 AM, Wang Bingnan visited the U.S. Ambassador to exchange views.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Lei Zhen, Secretary of the Political Consultative Conference, who has been traveling busily between Nanjing and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by car the night before last. After resting briefly at his hotel upon arriving here yesterday morning, Lei immediately drove to visit Sun Fo and Zhang Qun to convey the government's intentions. In the afternoon, Lei also visited Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party and continued to exchange views on issues such as reorganizing the government and resuming peace talks. According to Lei, he told reporters that the government reorganization is actively underway, and efforts are also being made to find an opportunity to quickly resume peace talks. The government hopes that peace talks can be resumed before the reorganization. His mission is to continue discussions with various parties to ensure the government reorganization begins as soon as possible and that the desire to "return power to the people" is realized promptly. It is also learned that Lei, Sun Fo, Zhang Qun, and leaders of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party will travel to Nanjing together within two or three days.</p>
<p>Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Joint Meeting to Discuss Peace Talk and Reorganization Plans</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party held an important meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. Attendees from the Democratic Socialist Party included Zhang Junmai, Xu Chuanlin, and other Standing Committee members. Attendees from the Youth Party included Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, and others. The focus of the discussions was to study concrete plans for reopening peace talks and reorganizing the government. Regarding the first point, all attendees believed this was a matter of sincerity from both sides, and given the current situation, it would be extremely difficult to achieve. Aside from the efforts of other parties, the government should strive to reform politics to win back popular support. Regarding the reorganization of the government, it was believed that the reorganization must be thorough, from the central government to the local levels, and must be carried out earnestly to create a good government and establish the people's trust in the government. Yesterday's meeting did not produce a concrete result, and it was decided to continue the meeting at Fan Garden tonight. Once a concrete plan is completed, Zhang Junmai will travel to Nanjing to meet with the Chairman and personally present everything. Xu Fulin also told reporters that the opinions within the Democratic Socialist Party are closer than before.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zuo Shunsheng told reporters: In the next day or two, government representatives and the Youth Party will exchange views. Regarding the peace talks, he said: No one opposes reopening peace talks; this is part of the effort to solve the current problems. Whether this can be achieved depends less on parties outside the two parties and more on the attitude of the two parties themselves.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since President Sun suggested convening a party conference to discuss and resolve national affairs, reporters inquired about this with various parties. Except for the Chinese Communist Party, which did not respond actively, Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party expressed support in principle, and Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party also expressed no opposition but hoped to clarify the specific methods. Xu also praised President Sun's sincerity in uniting the parties to jointly seek solutions to national affairs. The Democratic League stated that it had not yet studied it and that the Democratic League's position on the current situation would be published in a political declaration soon. (President Sun's talk on the current situation is in another article.)</p>
<h3>Communist Party Still Insisting on Two Points; Yan'an Will Issue Statement Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Communist Party member Wang Bingnan said on the 10th that the Communist Party's demand today is for China's true and lasting peace. If the government intends to restore peace, it should accept the two demands put forward by the Communist Party. This is the Communist Party's basic stance for seeking domestic peace. Without these two conditions, there is no way to talk about peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 10th] The Chinese Communist Party representatives in North China are still studying Marshal Marshall's statement upon leaving China. Ye Jianying, the CCP representative in the Military Mediation Team, announced today that Yan'an is expected to issue a formal statement on Sunday. American representative Giron of the Military Mediation Team declined to comment on the dissolution of the Military Mediation Team. Government representatives have no knowledge of the future of the Military Mediation Team.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 10th] Well-informed sources here revealed this morning that the government will likely send Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan to Yan'an soon to negotiate with Yan'an leaders on matters such as ending the civil war and the CCP's participation in the government. It is expected that as soon as Zhang Qun returns to Nanjing from Shanghai, the two government officials will depart for Yan'an. Zhang Junmai, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, will likely accompany Zhang Qun, as Marshall's statement mentioned the Democratic Socialist Party as the "middle ground," and its position is now gradually becoming more important.</p>
<h3>Amnesty and Commutation Methods</h3>
<p>Judicial Yuan Makes Preliminary Decision</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Judicial Yuan held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 10th to discuss concrete methods for implementing amnesty and commutation.

At the morning meeting, Chairman Zhang Bojun, in addition to conducting a general review of the resolutions that had been passed, also passed the following temporary proposals: (1) Regarding the incident of American soldiers insulting female students in Beiping, because the government did not lodge a protest with the American government, the Democratic League decided to "condemn" the government. (2) Regarding the Democratic League's policies, it was decided that the Democratic League's basic slogans, style, and attitude toward the Political Consultative Conference, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution would be determined in the future. In addition, its attitude toward U.S. policy toward China was also determined.

The lengthy political report of the conference will be published after being organized.</p>
<h3>Tenner Arrives in Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] General Tenner, commander of the U.S. Pacific Marine Corps, arrived in Tianjin from Qingdao at 3:30 PM on the 10th, accompanied by Howard, commander of the U.S. forces in North China.

<h3>Xinjiang Ethnic Issues</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong Talks About Genuine Equality</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Zhizhong said on the morning of the 10th that his position in Xinjiang Province is to represent the central government, implement the Three Principles of the People, and support the development of ethnic minorities. The only way to solve the ethnic problem in Xinjiang is to give ethnic groups genuine equality. County magistrates should be elected by the people, and representatives of each ethnic group should be allocated proportionally according to population. Representatives of all ethnic groups are currently participating in the Xinjiang Provincial Government. The ethnic armies have now been reorganized into six regiments, three security regiments and three army corps, stationed in Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan. Regarding military expenses, the security regiments are supplied by the local government, and the national army corps are paid by the national treasury.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Praises Marshal Marshall, Says His Mission to China Can Be Considered Successful</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cleveland, Ohio, 9th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun told reporters here today before a debate on national political affairs hosted by Time magazine that he was pleased that Marshall had been appointed Secretary of State. Marshall had achieved as much as he could in his mission to China. He had induced the Chinese government to accept many of the demands of the opposition parties, especially the Communist Party. In that respect, his mission could be considered a success. When a reporter asked the Ambassador to comment on Marshal Marshall's statement regarding reactionary elements within the National government, Gu said that within every political party, there were bound to be various different factions.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Gives Speech in the United States: We Respect Treaty Obligations; Negotiations on the Takeover of Dalian Will Begin Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun gave a public speech yesterday to discuss the Dalian issue, stating that formal negotiations between China and the Soviet Union will begin soon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cleveland, 9th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun recently gave a speech at the International Political Debate, condemning the Soviet Union's invasion of Northeast and Southeast Asia as contrary to the Yalta Agreement, and believing that this situation could cause friction and discord. He stated: China was not invited to participate in the Yalta Conference, which was the price the Soviet Union received for its cooperation in defeating Japan. However, the policies decided at the conference can only be regarded as temporary measures taken to accelerate the war. Even so, the consequences and impact should not be limited to the war period. The current situation is that the Soviet Union has a foothold in the Northeast, occupying the main railways from west to east and from Harbin to Dalian, extending to the Kuril Islands in the heart of the Bering Sea, and bordering China for 3,000 miles. All of this is an abnormal state. Therefore, China attaches great importance to the speedy return of Dalian. Moreover, in terms of the Yalta Agreement, although it is a joint cooperative movement in terms of morality and politics, it is unheard of for one country to demand the price of another country by sacrificing the interests of a third country. China accepted this agreement and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945 as a supplement. China is determined to respect its obligations, so the other party should also respect its obligations. At this point, Gu Weijun also criticized the actions of the CCP as sufficient to alienate the friendly relations between China and the United States. He also stated: The CCP's indecision on the political situation will make the economic situation even more difficult. The CCP's intention is to continue to create a chaotic situation, discredit the government, and then seize power. Under these circumstances, the government can only do its best to promote its plans for political unification and economic revival.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] Regarding the situation, regarding the Sino-Soviet implementation of the friendship treaty, it is heard that there have been thorough discussions in Nanjing, and the opinions of both sides are very close. At present, most of the research is on technical issues. It is said that there are about three major items discussed by both sides: (1) The Sino-Soviet joint management of the China Changchun Railway. The point of contention at the moment is that we strongly advocate limiting it to the property rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway before 1945, while the Soviet side requires that the property rights of the South Manchuria Railway operated by the Japanese be included. The above disputes may be resolved by seeking a compromise. (2) The Soviet side raised the issue of the Soviet Foreign Trade Bureau purchasing property rights from the Japanese in various parts of Northeast China before the withdrawal of Soviet troops. (3) The issue of our receiving Dalian. If the first two issues can be resolved first, then we may be able to receive Dalian sooner.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] The Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Northeast previously sent Section Chief Xu Liqun to Andong to assist the local military in negotiating the specific issues of receiving the Shuifeng Dam and the Laguqiao Dam of the Manchu Power Plant. Xu once contacted the Soviet garrison on the Yalu River Bridge and sent a letter in the name of Zhao Gongwu, commander of the Third Pacification District, to the commander of the Soviet garrison in northern Korea to discuss the date of the meeting. After many days, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Andong stating that no response had been received from the Soviet side to date and that the meeting was still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Shuifeng Power Plant</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] The Yalu River Laguqiao Shuifeng Hydroelectric Power Plant was jointly operated by the puppet Manchukuo and Korea. Construction began in 1937, and all construction was completed by the end of 1941. The steel and concrete dam, 898.7 meters long and 116 meters high, cuts off the flow of the Yalu River, extending across both sides of the Yalu River. The plant's machinery is located in the Korean territory on the south bank, with a total of seven generators, divided into two types: 50 cycles and 60 cycles. The 50-cycle generators are used exclusively in Northeast China, while the 60-cycle generators supply Korea. Each generator has a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, and the seven generators can generate a total of 700,000 kilowatts per day. Half of the electricity generated is supplied to various parts of Northeast China. After the Japanese surrendered, the Soviet army looted seven generators. Of the remaining four, one was damaged and cannot be used. Among the remaining three, two are 60-cycle generators and one is 50-cycle. Today, the Shuifeng Power Plant only has 100,000 kilowatts of electricity available for use in Northeast China. Currently, there are three transmission lines from the plant. One line is used by Korea, and the other two supply Andong and Lushun-Dalian, respectively. Today, the electricity in the Lushun-Dalian and Pulandian areas still relies on this supply.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] According to Newsweek, after Marshal Marshall was recalled to the country, some people in Washington believe that Admiral Lee may replace Stuart as the ambassador to China.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Legislative Yuan has not held a meeting for a month and a half since its last plenary session in mid-November of last year, when it passed the draft constitution.

<h3>President Sun Suggests Situation Recommendations, Hopes Parties Open Roundtable</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] President Sun issued a written statement yesterday entitled "A Suggestion on the Current Situation." The full text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Our country won the foreign war and leaped to become one of the great powers. It can be said that heaven and man returned, and it was an opportunity for thousands of years. Unfortunately, a large-scale armed political dispute followed, causing the people to suffer unspeakable pain and becoming the laughing stock of the international community. Engaging in political disputes with force is originally a barbaric and backward method, which has long disappeared in modern countries. Even the civil wars that once occurred in Greece and Egypt have been resolved, but in our country, one and a half years after victory, the civil war has not only not ended, but also seems to be becoming more intense and protracted. This should be regarded as a great shame by everyone, whether in or out of power, in government or among the people.</p>
<p>Recalling the days of the Political Consultative Conference a year ago, the people yearned for governance, and the whole country was filled with an atmosphere of unity and love. The various agreements it established were undoubtedly the only path for China to achieve peaceful unification and democratic construction. Not only did Marshal Marshall, who facilitated this meeting at that time, still affirm this in his recent statement and report, but the evolution of the situation over the years can also be said to be a strong proof. If the parties participating in the meeting were not blinded by their own subjective positions and temporary interests, and could have opened their hearts, been honest with each other, and unanimously promoted the rapid establishment of a coalition government after the meeting closed, I am sure that China's situation over the past year would have been much more advanced than it is now.</p>
<p>On the anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference, when we read Marshall's statement, in addition to admiring his fairness and correctness, we should especially reflect deeply on ourselves. The current situation of domestic political disputes is so dangerous. If we do not open up a path to resolve the problem quickly at this time and let it develop, then the future of our country will be unimaginable. I believe that the best way to solve the problem is for responsible representatives of all parties (including representatives of the Chinese Communist Party, of course) to hold another roundtable meeting in the near future. Everyone can abandon prejudices and subjective wishes, value the objective realities at home and abroad, act in the spirit of unity and cooperation, and consider the happiness of all the people of China. I believe that all problems can be solved peacefully. I hereby put forward such a suggestion to all parties and hope that the people of the whole country will rise up to promote its realization.</p>

<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Office on the 10th] Pixian County was captured by the Communist army on the evening of the 7th, and the residents of the city fled.

<h3>Mei Ru'ao Flies to Tokyo Today; The Trial of Japanese War Criminals Can Be Completed in June; Execution Will Be in Tokyo After the Verdict</h3>
<p>[City News] Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge of the Far East International Military Tribunal, returned to China from Tokyo a few days ago and reported to President Song on the work of the Military Tribunal. He is scheduled to take a US military plane back to Tokyo at 3 p.m. today. Yesterday, Mei told reporters from the Central News Agency that when the Far East Tribunal reopens at the end of January, it will begin to hear the evidence presented by the defense lawyers. It is expected that the prosecution can be completed within four months. The lawyers from both sides will begin to argue in late May, which is the real beginning of the struggle in the Far East Tribunal. The verdict can be pronounced in June. The convicts will be executed in Tokyo. Mei also said that he was pleased that his return to China had enabled the people of the country to understand the purpose of the work of the Far East Military Tribunal. The purpose of the work of the Far East Tribunal is not only to address the life and death issues of the 26 Japanese war criminals, but also to establish new principles of international law, or to clarify such principles of international law. In addition, it is to make the world understand that a war of aggression is a crime, and this responsibility is not only borne by the aggressive country, but also by the individual war criminals. In other words, we are all working to establish a new system to build world peace. At the same time, no one can use this to educate the vast Japanese people and assist them in building democracy and no longer being fooled by the warlords. Judge Mei also stated that Chinese law focuses on "free conviction," which is very different from English and American law, which focuses on evidence. China has suffered the most from the Japanese, and this time, in presenting evidence in court, at least more preparations should be made in that regard in the future.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Closure Will Be Completed Soon; If the Chinese Communists Build a Dam to Block the Water, the People Will Suffer Endlessly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The Huayuankou closure project has been 80 to 90 percent completed. The opening is shrinking day by day. The water level upstream of the pontoon bridge has risen by about two meters. The pontoon bridge originally had more than 100 openings, but only 10 remain for water to pass through. The old course of the river has been restored, and the water flow has now reached Changyuan, with a width of about 20 meters and a depth of 1 meter. If it flows into Shandong Province, the riverbed is not sandy soil, and its speed will be faster than in Henan Province. As for the Chinese Communist side's rumored construction of a transverse dam to block the water, according to an engineer, if the Chinese Communists do this, it will not only be extremely clumsy technically, but will also harm innocent people, which is really unwise. The flooded area in the former flood zone reached 6,000 square kilometers. After the autumn floods, two-thirds of the area is still flooded. After the closure is completely closed, the flooded area will all become fertile land.</p>
<p>Representatives of Refugees in Henan Province Request the Speedy Completion of the Closure</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] The people in the Yellow River flood area were extremely shocked by the Chinese Communist side's sudden opposition to the imminent completion of the Huayuankou closure. They specially sent representatives Li Mingzhong, Bu Zhen, and Li Guanyi to the Huayuankou Closure and Restoration Bureau, requesting that the work not be stopped under any circumstances in order to comfort the people in the flood area. The Li family and others hosted the press, painfully stating the pros and cons, saying that in the nine years of repeated disasters in the flood area, 20 counties were affected, and 13 counties are still in deep water. There are more than 10 million refugees, of which 3 million have moved far to the northwest provinces, living a precarious and miserable life. Those who have not moved have died of kala-azar in recent years, with more than 200,000 deaths. Under this long-term severe disaster, they only hope that the closure can be completed as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Communists ignored the suffering of tens of millions of refugees and opposed it. The refugees in the flood area cannot remain indifferent. If this project is obstructed by the Chinese Communists, the refugees in the flood area will automatically come to throw stones to block the closure. The Li family and others also pointed out that there are still more than 10,000 Communist troops in the flood area who are constantly harassing the local people.</p>
<p>Flood Area Construction Conference Opened in Kaifeng Yesterday</p>

Then, based on reality, they should conduct detailed research on the plan and quickly start implementation to save millions of compatriots. Group discussions were held in the afternoon, and the closing ceremony was scheduled for 2 p.m. on the 11th. On the 12th, they will visit Zhongmu and the Hugou flood area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 10th] The Henan Construction Department and the Agricultural Bank discussed and formulated agricultural loan measures for the flood area and disaster area.

The Henan Provincial Government will be responsible for two-tenths, and the Agricultural Bank will be responsible for eight-tenths.</p>
<p>There is also a draft by An and Hui, Deputy Directors of the Yellow River Closure and Embankment Restoration Project Bureau, regarding the situation in which Communist Party representatives Mingfu inspected the Hebei and Shandong Embankment Restoration Projects and were attacked by the Communist Army. Due to space constraints today, it will be published tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Huo Baoshu Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Huo Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 10th to report to President Song on the progress of the negotiations with the Chinese Communists in Shanghai on the issue of relief funds for residents of the riverbed, and returned to Shanghai that night.

<h3>Zhongshan County's Minguo Daily Confiscated by the Portuguese in Macau; Petition to the Government to Lodge Representations</h3>
<p>[Report from our Guangzhou Office on the 10th] Minguo Daily, based in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, has been sold in Macau. However, the Macau government recently used the excuse that the newspaper published articles on the 5th about overseas Chinese being harassed and on the 6th about the public trial of Japanese war criminal Zesawa, claiming that it violated Portuguese law and confiscated all copies of the newspaper. After unsuccessful negotiations, the newspaper argued that the news it published did not contain any slander against the Macau government, and now the government has unreasonably confiscated the newspaper. This barbaric act is a contempt for public law and a suppression of public opinion. It has been reported to the government and requested to lodge a protest.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Focus of Economic Problems</h3>
<p>The most disturbing phenomenon in society now is nothing more than economic problems, and the crux of economic problems is nothing more than financial problems. Some people think that many disturbances in the economic sector are mostly caused and promoted by finance, which is not an exaggeration. Because the exchange rate problem, the currency system problem, the usury problem, the gold problem, the price problem, the banking system problem, and the repayment problem of pre-war deposits are all prominent financial problems, and what we have seen and heard is caused by financial problems. There are not a few other incidental problems caused by the disturbances of the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Reinstatement of Commercial Banks On January 22, 1945, the Ministry of Finance promulgated supplementary measures for the reinstatement of commercial banks in the restored areas. Originally, all types A and B banks were required to submit various documents and apply for reinstatement within three months, and they would not be processed after the deadline. They must be ordered to suspend business, or they will not be allowed to resume business. Although special permission was granted to extend the deadline, it was also extended to July 15, 1946, and there was no further extension. But in fact, it is said that applications for sideline business can still be accepted so far, and it seems that the local municipal and county government's certification that it is closely related to local finance is too abstract, causing many unexpected entanglements. At a time when the restriction on the establishment of new banks is strictly enforced, the seriousness of this problem cannot be ignored. We believe that the Ministry of Finance's attitude towards this matter is not clear enough.</p>
<p>(2) The Black Market for US Dollars In fact, the black market for US dollars is one of the important factors in price fluctuations. In terms of law, it is difficult to solve the problem of country A's currency being used in country B. Moreover, the central and local governments have repeatedly declared that black markets are not allowed, and foreign currencies are not allowed to be used as a tool for paying prices and rents. However, those who are prohibited are prohibited, and those who use them use them, and each goes his own way, and it seems that they do not interfere with each other. Recently, there is a tradition of "foreign exchange self-management" for certain foreign goods. If what is said is not true, then without using US dollars, I wonder how this foreign exchange can be self-managed? In addition to seeking black markets, I wonder if there are any other ways to self-manage like US dollars? The current black market exceeds the official limit by an unknown number of times, and I don't know if the previous US dollar trading method has been clearly abolished or revised? Some people explain: it is true that there are many difficulties in prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency. However, before the military and public, foreign currency was more prevalent than it is today. At that time, the government unified legal currency and prohibited foreign currency, which was really effective. We do not believe that the difficulties are worse than before after the abolition of unequal skipping.</p>
<p>(3) The Problem of Checking and Carrying Banknotes One of the advantages of banknotes is that they are more convenient to carry than coins, which is a fact that everyone works. However, this convenience has now completely disappeared. Moreover, the entire banknote that makes Kun, even though the seals are mottled and the seals are intact, is actually a public fact that private tickets are added, and theft and damage are openly and secretly. Sitting and making innocent people be eroded horizontally, they can only sigh helplessly, and countless disputes have occurred. The responsible authorities must know this, right? But we have never seen any effective measures.</p>
<p>(4) The Problem of Returned Checks Returned checks are a legal problem, not just a moral problem. However, now the returned checks are in the thousands, without any scruples. According to the number of returned checks announced by the exchange house, it has exceeded the normal exchange amount before the war, but I know that there is still no effective way to prevent it. The administrative and judicial aspects are probably irrelevant to them, and they can be ignored.</p>
<p>(5) The Supervision Problem of Commercial Banks The prior approval procedures for the establishment or reinstatement of commercial banks were originally very prudent. After the event, there are also permanent inspection agencies, deposits, loans, and there are preparation and review methods. Speculation, hoarding, gold and real estate mortgages are all prohibited. The authorities' maintenance of finance and introduction of the right track can be said to be the ultimate, there is nothing to add. However, if there is a slight disturbance in the market, there is always a type of uncautious firm that is directly or indirectly involved in the vortex and cannot extricate itself. If it is said that these firms are completely self-inflicted and should be eliminated, and there is no need to care about them, this naturally has a considerable reason. What is strange is that there are always some schadenfreude people who take advantage of others' difficulties and intend to replace them. The methods are particularly clever, or even 30 to 20 percent off, and heavy profits are made. On the surface, they are helping people in emergency, but in fact, they are receiving high interest rates. This cannot be said to be a strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>(6) The Loan Problem The procedures for various loans have long aroused many criticisms. Because it is clearly a loan for relief purposes, asking for this below and responding to this above, everyone admits it clearly. Therefore, in addition to the necessary investigation and guarantee to prevent it from flowing into improper uses, everything that can be Liu Tong should be given special consideration and should not be considered from a business perspective everywhere. For example, the heads of frequent banks and unlimited guarantees, as well as other trivial procedures, seem to be negotiable. Now aren't there many accounts that are discouraged and would rather give up this favor? Isn't there also a request from the authorities for simplification and relaxation? This can also prove the excessive trouble of the current method.</p>
<p>The public understands that this is a time of public and private difficulties. Industry and commerce are naturally waiting to be fed, thirsting for the government's emergency relief. The government's finances have long reached the point where they rely on printing money to deal with emergencies. How can there be sufficient surplus capacity to satisfy the general insatiable demands? According to normal theory, circulating finance and supporting industry and commerce are the natural duties of general commercial banks. They are unable to do so. Only when special circumstances occur do they turn to national banks to be their backing. The meaning of the so-called bank of banks is that in these situations, national banks should be asked to help, not to ask them to take on difficult tasks alone and replace the business of general banks. Therefore, the financial authorities must, on the one hand, strengthen national banks so that they can fulfill their responsibilities, and at the same time, they must assist general commercial banks as much as possible and make full use of them to share the responsibility of regulating finance. It is really like two wheels on a car, like two wings of a bird. A slight injury will affect the strength of the general and even themselves. This is a very clear theory. What is the current situation? We do not want to speculate deeply, but there have long been people advocating the abolition of the Four Allied Banks and the specialization of national banks, and the abolition of commercial banks' loan limits and the bottom-out deposit reserve, etc., have been partially realized, so it can be seen that the support for commercial banks still needs continued efforts.</p>
<p>Other problems, such as the flight of funds, the overflow of preparedness, and the deformed currency system in Northeast China and Taiwan, all need to be corrected to continue the national currency system and consolidate national resources. Therefore, the pressing problem now seems to be concentrated on finance. It is hoped that all parties concerned will recognize this point, concentrate their efforts, and solve it first, and then the entire economic problem will be better organized.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Shanghai Refugee Students Petition in Nanjing Without Success; Held a Press Conference Yesterday to Report the Process</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Yang Peilin, Yang Hanxun, and Qin Bangnan, representatives of the Shanghai Refugee Students Association who went to Nanjing to petition, held a press conference at the China University Student Union at 3:00 PM this afternoon. They stated that after arriving in Nanjing on the morning of the 7th, they went to the Ministry of Education to petition. Councilor Guo received them and expressed sympathy. On the same morning, Yang and others went to the Ministry of Education again to see the minister. After being referred, they contacted the Higher Education Department. Section Chief Gao of the department met with them and said that the matter of public funding for poor refugee students from private schools had been submitted to the Executive Yuan, but had not been approved. The Ministry of Education was very clear and sympathetic to their difficult situation, and they would resubmit the situation to the Executive Yuan for instructions. Yang and others were not satisfied with this answer and decided not to return to Shanghai on the 10th. They decided to go to the Ministry of Education again on the morning of the 11th to request Minister Zhu to obtain concrete results before leaving Nanjing. Yang and others also stated that all of the more than 500 members of the petitioning group had originally planned to go to Nanjing together, but because of the incident of the rape of a female student at Peking University, in order to reduce trouble for the government and avoid misunderstandings, they changed to sending three representatives to Nanjing. If this action does not yield substantial results, all 500 refugee students may go to Nanjing to expand the petition.</p>

<p>[Our Wenling Dispatch] On New Year's Day, dozens of students from Wenling County Normal School were watching a movie in the county government auditorium. At 8:00 PM, a certain captain of the Second Squadron of the County Police Team came with three female relatives. Because there were no seats, they squeezed the students' seats.

<h3>A Slap Kills a Vendor; Town Chief Bribes to Settle the Murder Case; The Weak Younger Brother Cries Injustice</h3>
<p>[Our Liuhe Dispatch] Donggou Town in the third district of the county is connected to Donggou Township in the fourth district of Yizheng County. Only the Daqiao Bridge on this street is the boundary. The area east of the bridge is Donggou Township in Yizheng County, and the area west of the bridge is Dongning Town in this county. When there are special circumstances, the township chiefs of both sides will consult with each other to handle them. At about 10:00 AM on December 25th of last year, Li Jiucai (about 40 years old), a villager from Donggou Township, Yizheng County, was selling tofu along the street. When he was on the Dongning Town section, Sun Lishu, a town resident, bought two catties of tofu. A conflict arose between the two over a 100 yuan change. Sun Lishu was young, strong, fierce, and unusual. Taking advantage of the fact that he was unprepared, he raised his hand and slapped Li in the ear. Li fell to the ground and died on the spot. Town Chief Zhang Yifang of Donggou Town asked local people to settle the matter hastily for more than one million yuan. Li Jiuhai, the younger brother of the deceased, reported to the Dongqing Township Office for legal handling because his brother was beaten to death innocently. After receiving the report, Township Chief Xia Boru of Donggou Township believed that Town Chief Zhang Yifang of Dongning Town had bribed and settled the murder case, forcing the family of the deceased to accept the settlement, which was an illegal act and violated the criminal law. He will report the details of the case to the Judicial Office of this county for legal handling.</p>
<h3>Jin Hua Tongji Bridge Damaged Again Half a Year After Repair</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jinhua Bureau] The Tongji Bridge in this county, historically known as a marvel of eastern Zhejiang and a vital transportation artery, was partially destroyed by enemy bombing in April of the thirty-first year (of the Republic - 1942) due to strategic considerations during the Japanese invasion of eastern Zhejiang. Later, Jinhua fell into enemy hands, and the enemy purchased wood to repair it. After the restoration of sovereignty, the government authorities, recognizing that the bridge had been damaged and dilapidated after being occupied by the enemy for three years, deemed it necessary to repair it again. They previously requested and were approved by the Administrative Yuan Branch Office to use the method of "work-for-relief," inviting merchants to contract the project, which was completed in July of last year. However, recently, due to the large number of heavy vehicles passing over it, the wood in the middle section has cracked again, and the wooden railings on the west side are also shaky and about to fall. The safety of pedestrians is a concern. It is reported that the county police bureau is discussing with local gentry and relevant authorities to find a way to repair it again to ensure safety.</p>

<p>Since the government announced the Conscription Law, conscription has begun. Because the knowledge level of our compatriots is not high enough, every new policy will inevitably cause some disturbances, let alone conscription. To compatriots with insufficient knowledge, the facts are already terrifying. Furthermore, the village heads and heads of groups lack prior publicity, leading to various disturbances. I, as a member of the nation, should support conscription. Therefore, I offer a humble opinion for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Our compatriots are afraid of military service due to long-standing habits and a current lack of knowledge. To make our compatriots unafraid of military service, the fundamental solution lies in education, and the immediate solution lies in advocacy. The fundamental solution is not something that can be achieved overnight, but the immediate solution is that grassroots workers lack sufficient preparation. No wonder our compatriots are confused and want to fear and evade it. Their method of evasion is to find substitutes, and hiring substitutes costs a great deal of money. The village heads and heads of groups assign how much each substitute should pay. Poor compatriots, fearing conscription, have no choice but to painfully pay the money. I ask, are these substitutes beneficial to the country? The purpose of national conscription is to prevent problems before they occur and to be able to cope with sudden events at any time and anywhere. But how can these substitutes cope? Secondly, these types of substitutes can repeatedly perform substitute work. Over time, this will inevitably evolve into career soldiers. If something happens, they will be at a loss. Can this seriousness be ignored? Therefore, I believe that the government should ( ) before starting conscription, earnestly guide the meaning and mission of military service, and earnestly warn against substitutes. If there are substitutes, how should they be punished? (B) The conscripted soldiers should be strictly inspected for their qualities. If any suspicion of substitutes is found, they should be rejected and the conscription officers should be responsible for resending them.</p>
<p>(2) Poor compatriots are also afraid of being conscripted because of their livelihoods. They are already struggling to make ends meet. Once they are conscripted, their families will be eligible to starve to death. The government is also aware of this and has regulations for deferment. However, deferment only postpones conscription temporarily. During the deferment period, the economic situation of these poor compatriots is unlikely to improve. So what will happen after the deferment period? Therefore, I think it would be better to organize a conscript mutual aid association. The purpose of the mutual aid association is: (A) For any conscript who is indeed responsible for the livelihood of the entire family, it is stipulated that a mutual aid fund will be provided. The amount of the fund can be adjusted at any time according to the cost of living index. The mutual aid fund will be paid monthly to their family. (B) The mutual aid fund will be shared equally by all conscripts in the district. (C) After the conscript completes his service, he must also fulfill the same obligation. (He Zhongmou)</p>
<p>The Displaced Urgently Need National Identification Cards</p>
<p>I am a refugee from Huai'an who fled to Shanghai. Although I have a place to live and am not suffering from the hardship of sleeping in the open, my longing for my hometown is constant. Fortunately, our army recovered Huai'an City in mid-September. I was overjoyed upon hearing this good news and wished I could fly home immediately. When I was packing to return home, I suddenly received a letter from my family saying that anyone who fled outside the city must have a national identity card to enter the city. It is not easy to stay in an inn along the way. Therefore, I registered with the head of the security office. (Because the first phase of registration had passed when I came to Shanghai.) I really hoped to get it back home in ten days or half a month. Unexpectedly, more than two months have passed and there is still no news. If it is delayed like this, how can I not feel anxious?</p>
<p>Because your newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, I urge you to publish this letter and hope that the relevant authorities will expedite the issuance of supplementary national identity cards to the heads of each district for distribution to the applicants, so that many refugees can return to their hometowns and reunite with their families as soon as possible.

<p>The Problem of Sewage Contracting in This City</p>
<p>Regarding the sewage contracting problem in this city, it has recently become a hot topic again. Because there is a lot of money to be made, various parties are competing to obtain this good business and immediately become a huge undertaking. Whether their calculations are stable or not, we don't care. But from the standpoint of public health, it is necessary to review it.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been in Shanghai for a long time knows that for the past several decades, the municipal authorities have entrusted such an important sanitation task to several contractors, resulting in the creation of several "sewage kings" who have also accumulated a special kind of power that still exists today and cannot be eradicated for a while. A single alley is controlled by a single sewage worker, a single section is controlled by a single vehicle owner, a single pier is controlled by a single pier director, and a single area is controlled by a single "sewage king." They collude with each other, manipulating this interest, and will never easily allow laborers to intervene. Therefore, they do not attach importance to this sanitation work, but only seek profit, taking income as the first priority. They arbitrarily demand monthly fees from residents, request gratuities for festivals, and yearly bonuses. When they are not satisfied, they can arbitrarily refuse to empty the sewage, or even jointly strike. The authorities and millions of residents have no choice but to sigh helplessly. As for the proposed restoration of the contracting system, as long as we look at the facts before us, not only the sanitation authorities recognize it very clearly, but every resident will definitely not agree to its revival. Since the Yongda Company, a contractor, was changed to a public-private partnership in November of the 34th year (of the Republic - 1945), and then on April 1st of the 35th year, the municipal council resolutely decided to formally establish the Sanitation Bureau, which was completely taken over by the city, citizens across the city have placed deep expectations on this! The wise measures should be thoroughly implemented to reform our administration of decades in one fell swoop. I remember that the media at the time greatly encouraged this, because every citizen had suffered from the pain inflicted by the contractors and hoped to be liberated from the hands of the "sewage kings." But how long has it been? Now there is talk of reviving the contracting system again. It is impossible not to be surprised. I heard that since the establishment of the Sanitation Bureau, monthly income has gradually increased. Recently, monthly income has always been more than 300-400 million yuan. Compared with the period when contractors profited from it, it is no longer the same. If it is said that the contracting system is being restored to increase municipal revenue, it is obviously not justified. So what is it for? Is it because difficulties were encountered in promoting the work, or is it to place the responsibility for improving public health on a few profit-seeking contractors and evade this responsibility themselves? That is even more unreasonable. At the same time, our sanitation authorities should not and cannot evade this responsibility.</p>
<p>Now let's review the achievements since the establishment of the Sanitation Bureau. As for the internal situation of the Sanitation Bureau, outsiders cannot know it in detail. But from what we have seen, for example, the extortion and refusal to empty sewage by sewage workers, once citizens report it, the bureau has now improved a lot regarding the sewage workers who violate the rules. Regarding the monthly fee amounts and the regulations on public deputy paper sales prices and taking gratuities, the bureau has also issued repeated announcements. The original lack of standards is now something that citizens across the city have adapted to. The original sewage truck transportation and pier work hours were indefinite, but now they can all comply with the stipulated time. Under deeply rooted malpractices, this small improvement, although not entirely satisfactory, is already commendable. We are definitely not protecting the current sanitation administrators, but only hope that the sanitation authorities can select competent talents to take on this sanitation work that is closely related to millions of citizens, so that it can be further improved to comfort the longings of the citizens.</p>
<p>According to the reports in the newspapers a few days before the festival, the sewage contracting system is on the verge of being revived, and has been passed by the municipal government, and has also put forward several points of opinion, which will be submitted to the Health Committee of the current Municipal Council for discussion and passage. I hope that our city councilors and municipal authorities should think about the welfare of the public. Hopes placed on a small number of profit-seeking contractors are fundamentally unreasonable.

<h3>The US Government's New Budget Proposal: Truman Submits to Congress, Amounting to Over $37.5 Billion; Defense Expenditures Still Account for the Largest Share</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 10th] President Truman today submitted to Congress the US government's estimated budget for the year beginning July 1st, totaling $37,528 million, and 恳 (earnestly) requested Cheffer to reduce tax rates. However, Republican congressmen claim that this amount can be cut by $8 billion, and those who advocate tax cuts are quite determined. President Truman's annual budget consultation estimates that if income taxes are collected as usual, the government can have a surplus of $202 million by June 30, 1948, the end of the next fiscal year. Furthermore, if Congress approves the continued collection of luxury taxes that are currently scheduled to be reduced starting July 1st, and the Post Office Department increases postage to make up for the shortfall in postal expenses, then this surplus can increase to $800 million. President Truman does not agree with the Democrats' claim that tax rates can be reduced while still balancing the budget, stating, "This is a realistic budget, and it is as perfect as possible within our capabilities. If there are any surplus funds, they should be used to pay off the public debt, which currently totals $260.4 billion." President Truman allocated $6,758 million to the Army and $4,423 million to the Navy, and also stated, "Defense expenditures are still the largest item in the budget. We still bear significant responsibilities arising from the war. The military occupation of Europe and the Far East must continue. Defense expenditures, fixed expenditures, tax refunds, international expenses, and assistance to veterans require a total of $33 billion and cannot be cut. The rest is the cost of the programs carried out by various departments and agencies. The expenses requested by various departments and agencies are far more than the amount in the budget."</p>

<h3>The United States Government Has Decided To Demand Japanese Reparations Immediately; MacArthur Will Proceed As Soon As Instructions Arrive; Unwilling to Accommodate Soviet Objections</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 9th] The State Department and the War Department announced today that the United States has decided to demand Japanese reparations immediately, and is unwilling to accommodate objections from the Soviet Union and other wartime allies. According to Penfield, the Acting Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, it will be used for reparations. Under Secretary of the Army Peterson also stated that MacArthur and the Japanese government will be notified as soon as possible which industries should be left in Japan so that the Japanese can base their economic recovery on realistic foundations and no longer rely on US aid. Although this move is often notified to the Far Eastern Commission, it does not need to wait for its formal approval. Regarding the occupying forces in Japan, the United States has 124,000 troops, and the United Kingdom has 40,000 troops. Peterson also stated that the United States has shipped a total of more than 2 million tons of food to Japan, which should be paid for by Japan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 10th] After reports from the Philippine Five-Person Reparations Committee and Nanjing that China had also decided to send a five-person delegation to this country to inspect Japanese factories that could be used as reparations, it was learned today that other Allied countries will also send the same delegation.</p>

As for how to allocate the machinery of the more than 1,000 Japanese factories that have been designated, a list has been drawn up, but a final decision has not yet been made.</p>

The Director of the Executive Yuan Materials Supply Bureau, Jiang Biao, has been notified to attend the meeting at 10:00 am to report. The afternoon will continue with proposal discussions.</p>
<h3>Over 300 Mu of Civilian Land: Military Needs Cited as the Reason for Non-Return, According to Zhu Ping</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau responded orally to the inquiries of councilors the other day, stating: (1) Regarding the enemy and puppet forces occupying over 300 mu of civilian land near Zhujiaqiao in Pudong to build an anti-aircraft artillery position, after the city government's restoration, it received requests from the landowners for return in November of the previous year. However, at that time, the Third Corps Command stated that there were important matters requiring its retention. After the Land Administration Bureau jointly dispatched personnel with the Third Corps Command for on-site surveys, it was claimed that there were still military needs. A decision on how to proceed would be made after further study, but no response has been received to date. Now that it has been raised, the bureau will send a letter to General Tang Enbo of the Garrison Command in Nanjing and Shanghai to inquire. If there is no longer a need, it will be returned to the landowners. (2) From the start of land value tax collection on November 16th to December 31st last year, a total of 3.07 billion yuan was collected. The previous council meeting stipulated that 3 billion yuan be collected, and by the end of last year, it had been fully collected, exceeding the target by 70 million yuan. The Land Administration Bureau only collects and does not receive; the collection is handled separately by personnel dispatched by the city treasury. As for the allocation of the collected funds, since everything is统筹統支 by the city government, the Finance Bureau can be consulted on how it is allocated. The exact acreage of land taxed requires detailed investigation. (3) Regarding the suggestion that the city government lease public land to civilians to solve part of the housing shortage problem, the city government's solution to the housing shortage, drafted at the end of August last year, already stipulated the leasing of public land for housing construction. Therefore, this proposal aligns with the city government's established policy. Moreover, the city government not only leases public land but also stipulates that new buildings are exempt from land value tax for two years and house tax for one year to encourage the construction of new houses. (4) Regarding the illegal sale of public land during the enemy and puppet period, the results of the investigation regarding the old Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council have been obtained from the central government. As it involves diplomacy, negotiations are being conducted separately with Britain and France, and concrete results are pending. Additionally, leases and sales by the puppet city government are declared invalid. (5) The land value tax collection applies to areas where land registration has been completed. Areas without registration are still subject to land tax. (6) The standard for land value estimation during the land value tax collection was determined after investigation and discussion by an evaluation committee organized in accordance with central regulations. Land value division is based on average prices determined by region, not estimated for each individual plot. Therefore, those with lower values benefit slightly, while those with higher values inevitably suffer. Land values are planned to be re-estimated this year, and every effort will be made to correct inaccuracies at that time. As for the point that land value tax collection does not consider income, land value tax is a property tax and is not based on income. According to the central land law, vacant land must also be taxed, and at a high rate. (6) Regarding the fact that land ownership certificates have not yet been issued, the review process requires fifteen procedures, and according to law, there is also a two-month announcement period. Due to these legal procedures, it is unavoidable. However, when owners need them, they can be returned after being photographed to avoid hindering the owners' capital operations.</p>
<h3>Agreed Solution for Vegetable Vendors Inside and Outside the Eleventh District Market</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Vegetable vendors outside the Eleventh District Market petitioned the city council, requesting to set up stalls in their original locations outside the market. However, vendors inside the market also petitioned the council, requesting that vendors outside the market comply with the police bureau's regulations and relocate to locations 300 yards away from the market. The two sides were deadlocked. After the speaker dispatched Councilors Yan E'sheng and Tang Shichang to jointly consult with Section Chief Zhi Chao of the police bureau and Director Zhang Wei of the health bureau, a solution was agreed upon: (1) The more than 80 vegetable vendors who were originally inside the market but later moved outside must return to their original stalls inside the market to do business. (2) On the Zhenshanhaiguan Road side of the market, from the Chengdu Road intersection to the Shanhaili, and on the Chengdu Road side, from the Zhenshanhaiguan Road intersection to the Sanderli, all vegetable vendors outside the market must relocate and are not allowed to set up stalls. (3) All other locations remain unchanged. (4) This solution is temporarily approved until the end of the lunar year. However, Section Chief Fang stated that in the future, apart from the front and side of the market, where stalls are not allowed, if other locations do not obstruct traffic, they may be allowed to continue setting up stalls until the deadline; otherwise, they must be banned.</p>
<h3>Budget Subcommittee Review Results: Net Increase of 41.3 Billion Yuan Deemed Possible; Hope for Further Streamlining of the City Government's Extensive Organization</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Based on the budget reports from various bureaus and departments of the city government the other day, the city council's budget committee held a subcommittee review meeting at the residence of Councilor Xu Yongzuo yesterday evening at 7:00 pm to review this year's budget. Councilor He Yuanming chaired the meeting, and Speaker Pan also attended in person. After preliminary deliberations, the committee plans to make some increases and decreases within the regular expenditure category, resulting in a net increase of over 41.34 billion yuan. Increases include: land value tax 3.6 billion, business tax 28 billion, slaughter tax 4.8 billion, business license tax 3.6 billion, wharf dues 15.1 billion, inheritance tax 2 billion, fines over 3.88 billion yuan, administrative fees 1 billion, business fees 8.8 billion, and excess land revenue over 13.3 million yuan, totaling approximately 52 billion yuan. Decreases include: vehicle license tax 1.8 billion, banquet tax 4.8 billion, and inn tax 4.2 billion, totaling approximately 10.8 billion yuan. Entertainment tax will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The committee found the budget review extremely difficult because revenue departments could not be increased much, and expenditure departments were difficult to reduce. However, the city government's organization is too large, with numerous agencies and excessive personnel. Therefore, the committee can only ask the city government to consider streamlining and merging under the principle of retrenchment and will submit this opinion for discussion at today's general assembly.</p>
<h3>Request to Determine the Number of National Assembly Delegates for Directly Governed Municipalities; Telegram Nationwide to Unanimously Support the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] At yesterday's city council meeting, chaired by Speaker Pan, discussions on proposals began, resulting in the passage of six proposals related to civil affairs. Among them, the proposal to suggest that the Legislative Yuan legally determine the number of National Assembly delegates to be elected by directly governed municipalities to rectify omissions in the constitution and demonstrate fairness was met with enthusiastic speeches by Luo Qinghua, Tao Baichuan, Qu Cheng, and others. They argued that Article 26 of the constitution, which was passed by the National Assembly and regulates the organization of National Assembly delegates, is particularly disadvantageous to directly governed municipalities. They requested that the status of directly governed municipalities be determined, with each district of a directly governed municipality being equivalent to a county in a province, generating one representative. The discussion resulted in the passage of the original proposal, with the council sending letters to the city councils of other directly governed municipalities to jointly advocate for suggestions to the central government.</p>
<p>A temporary emergency motion by Zhou Lianze and 23 others to send a telegram nationwide to support the constitution was unanimously passed.</p>
<p>Other civil affairs proposals passed include: (1) Suggesting that city government officials periodically inspect suburban areas to promote suburban development. (2) The city government should promptly implement the resolutions of the first general assembly to respect public opinion. (3) Requesting the city government authorities to reduce redundant personnel and increase the salaries of working staff to prevent corruption. (4) Suggesting that the central government determine the autonomy of citizens in directly governed municipalities as soon as possible and that the council draft a local autonomy law for the city. (5) Each suburban area of the city should quickly establish a people's self-defense force.</p>

<h3>French Tram Slowdown Incident: Please Expedite Impartial Interruption and Immediately Restore Normalcy</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] A temporary motion submitted by City Councilors Shi Zhifu and 26 others at yesterday's general assembly stated: "The public vehicles operated by the French Tram Company are moving slowly. Please urge the relevant authorities to immediately supervise improvements to facilitate transportation." The general assembly resolved that the city government should promptly order the Public Utilities and Social Affairs Bureaus to impartially interrupt (截断) [translator note: cut off, intervene] within a specified period and order the company to immediately restore normal traffic conditions. If the company fails to comply with the interruption for any reason, it should be sanctioned according to the law.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu stated regarding this case: "This matter is a labor dispute, but the responsibility does not lie entirely with the company. We should sympathize with and assist the labor side, but the labor side's intentional work slowdown before mediation and arbitration is illegal."</p>
<p>Additionally, the temporary motion submitted by Shao Yongsheng and others regarding the shantytown problem requested that, based on the principle of not harassing the common people and not endangering public safety, the Public Works, Social Affairs, and Legal Regulations Committees, along with representatives from the five bureaus, hold regular joint meetings to formulate concrete measures for the government to implement conscientiously. The general assembly passed the motion without objection.</p>
<h3>Stalemate in Year-End Bonus Issue: Evening Newspapers Continued to Suspend Publication Yesterday</h3>
<p>The city's major evening newspapers, including Lianhe, have been suspending publication since the day before due to the inability to resolve the year-end bonus issue between labor and management. According to the person in charge of the newspaper workers, "The management of each newspaper had agreed to issue one month's salary as a year-end bonus, and some had already advanced half of it. However, on the evening of the 8th, the management took joint action, announcing a rigid rule of half a month's salary for the year-end bonus and enforcing it forcibly. As a result, the management stopped providing manuscripts for the past two days, and the labor side was unable to work. The responsibility for this should be borne by the authorities of each newspaper. For more than 360 days a year, we work tirelessly, using both our hands and brains, sweating and exerting ourselves, living in a state of constant tension. If we take sick leave or personal leave, we must find replacement workers at high prices. We have no weekly holidays and no salary increases or overtime pay. Therefore, our actual income for the year is less than ten months out of twelve, with a monthly salary of only over 100,000 yuan. Therefore, our request for one month's salary this time is fair and reasonable. As for the management's difficulties, that is indeed the case, but most newspaper operations report losses. We cannot stop eating for fear of choking."</p>
<p>Moreover, the Shanghai Night Newspaper Liaison Association issued a letter to the workers of various night newspapers yesterday, stating: "We believe that the year-end bonus issue raised by the workers of the six evening newspapers this time should be sympathized with. We accept it in principle. The problem is that in the context of the overall industrial and commercial decline in Shanghai, we have exhausted our efforts and exceeded our capabilities. Therefore, we never believe that the workers' demands should be ignored. We only hope for mutual understanding of the actual difficulties and seek a solution that suits the actual conditions of both sides. We hope that with your understanding, we can resume our duty to society as journalists as soon as possible. Therefore, we are extremely willing for the problems between us to be resolved quickly."</p>
<h3>Foolish Thief Turns Himself In</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Xicheng cigarette paper shop at 370 Fujian Road was robbed on the evening of the 5th of this month at 8:30 pm by five or six bandits who claimed to be searching for opium and robbed 660,000 yuan in cash and gold jewelry. Before leaving, they even forced the shop owner, Gao Huanren, to issue a check for 1 million yuan from the Coal Industry Bank. Afterwards, Gao reported it to the police bureau, and Section Chief Li dispatched officers to investigate. On the afternoon of July, the bandits, because the check was a crossed check and could not be cashed, sent the bandit Sun Qiutao to negotiate with Gao, where he was arrested by the police. He confessed that his accomplices were hiding at 150 Julu Road. The police rushed to the address and arrested Xin Ruolei, Yu Haoran, Chen Xiaoyun, Xin Tianyu, Ding Youding, and five others. They then went to 30 Wenchang Lane, Tanggu Road, and seized three pistols, one Mauser pistol, 21 bullets, and stolen goods including a gold ring. During the interrogation, Xin Ruolei even claimed to be a section chief of the Central Statistics Bureau, while the bandit Yu claimed to be a deputy secretary. However, after the police bureau investigated with the Central Statistics Bureau, they learned that it was all a false pretense. The case was completed yesterday. The suspects confessed to impersonating the Central Statistics Bureau and robbing the Xicheng cigarette paper shop. All firearms were supplied by the fugitive Huang Jinman, so they were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.</p>

<h3>Embezzlement by Staff Still Under Investigation</h3>
<h3>Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Zhenru Plant Announces Dissolution at the End of the Month: Official Explanation is Due to No Achievements in a Year</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The spokesperson of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration announced yesterday that the Zhenru plant has been scheduled to be dissolved at the end of this month. The remaining machinery and equipment, approximately 100,000 tons, will be taken over by the Shanghai branch's industrial and mining equipment warehouse. Except for a portion to be laid off, the remaining employees in the original plant will be assigned to other parts of the general office to work. The authorities' decision to dissolve the Zhenru Equipment Plant is officially explained as being due to no achievements by the plant in the past year. However, it is generally believed to be closely related to the recent discovery of senior officials of the plant stealing materials and equipment.</p>
<p>It is said that the senior officials of the plant used their positions to steal materials and equipment from the plant and privately entrusted commercial firms to sell them, resulting in significant losses. After the incident, nine Chinese and foreign engineering personnel, including Deputy Director Heath, were implicated and are currently under investigation. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration authorities have conducted a thorough investigation into the matter and are trying to recover the stolen goods. According to reporters' inquiries to the responsible parties yesterday, the value of the stolen goods recovered to date is approximately over 100 million yuan, approaching 200 million yuan. The total value of all stolen goods is difficult to estimate because the theft has been carried out more than ten times. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration authorities are continuing to investigate, and have also ordered the plant to investigate the receipt and dispatch of materials over the past year, and the truth will soon come to light.</p>
<p>The official claim that the plant's work was fruitless refers to the aspect of training talent. The plant was established in the spring of last year, and it was intended to train people to use various state-of-the-art machines in the manner of a technical school. The reporter still remembers that when the plant hosted a tour in August, Deputy Director Heath claimed that it could be completed within half a year, but to date, it is understood that only a few tractor drivers have been trained.</p>
<h3>Old Judge Changes Sides: Sun Shaokang Pleads Not Guilty, Claiming He Was Ordered to Serve as a Puppet Official</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Sun Shaokang, the former Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court who later defected and served as the president of the puppet Shanghai District Court, was tried at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Sun is already 62 years old, bald with graying short hair, wearing a blue cloth robe and black cotton shoes. He spoke with a Northeast accent and carefully reviewed the transcript of his previous court testimony, wearing old spectacles to read each word and correcting two errors. He then argued that when he was serving as the Chief Prosecutor of the District Court, the Shanghai Concessions had not yet fallen into enemy hands. The Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, Qiao Wanxuan, had already collaborated with the enemy. He initially did not know this, and was lured by Qiao to a residence in western Shanghai where he was taken by a member of Unit 76 to participate in a puppet organization. He replied that the central government severely punished collaborators with the enemy, and without considering patriotism, he was simply afraid of dying, and he婉转地 [tactfully] answered to the puppet agent. After being released, he reported to Pan Zixin, who telegraphed the Military Intelligence Bureau, and later received (1) Jing Chenyu, (2) Jing Xuyu, (3) Jing Xu San telegrams approving his participation in the puppet organization to engage in underground work to protect underground workers. After receiving the telegram, he took office as the puppet president. He even said with a confident tone that with his small qualifications, if he were to be a traitor, he would be more than just the president of the District Court. He had served as the president of the District Court seven or eight times before the war, and he was really tired of doing it. His words implied that he was lowering himself. He also requested to confront Xia Zhongming, a puppet agent from Unit 76 who was in custody, because Xia had testified in the previous hearing that he had participated in the Unit 76 court colleagues' research society, which was quite detrimental to him.</p>
<h3>Publisher of University Eye Drops Denies Supplying Alcohol to the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Wang Zhensan, the original publisher of University Eye Drops, was accused of opening the Hequn Alcohol Factory during the enemy and puppet period, hiring Japanese technicians, and supplying alcohol to the enemy. He argued in the High Court yesterday that the alcohol was not supplied to the enemy, but was sold through ordinary stores. The defendant's defense lawyer presented two advertisements published in puppet newspapers at the time as proof. The court ordered further investigation and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Tao Zhongli, Accused of Harming Underground Workers, Was Questioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Tao Zhongli, accused of colluding with the enemy and puppet forces to harm underground workers and extort merchants, was questioned in the High Court yesterday. The defendant claimed to be a businessman and denied colluding with the enemy and puppet forces. The court adjourned the hearing.</p>
<p>It is said that Tao Zhongli once organized the Dazhong Shipping Company, the Dongfang Shanghai Opera House, and the Jichang Cotton Shop. He was very close to the captain of the enemy's military police, Takeshita, and the translators Zheng Jinwen and Wang Bin. On October 5, 1942, he led enemy soldiers from Tanaka and lured Weng Maoxiong, the standing committee member of the 20th branch directly under our party committee in Nanhui County, to the enemy's military police team at Wangjia Wharf in the city for detention, where he was subjected to severe torture. Tao extorted 50,000 yuan in puppet currency from him before Weng was released on bail. In May 1945, he extorted merchants Xi Deming and Fan Jinkun. Xi was extorted of ten tins of White Tin-Wrapped cigarettes and 50,000 yuan in puppet currency, and Fan was extorted of 1 million yuan in puppet currency. All of these were handled by Tao Zhongli and handed over to Takeshita for distribution, with the defendant receiving 200,000 yuan in puppet currency.</p>
<h3>Former Puppet Government Deputy Minister of Finance's Appeal Maintains Original Sentence</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yan Jiazhi, who served as the Governor of Guangdong during the Qing Dynasty and as the Deputy Minister of Finance in the puppet government, was previously sentenced to 15 years in prison by the High Court.

<h3>Wife and Children Scattered, Old Father Commits Suicide: Chen Hui Sues for Damages of 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Guanfu, a local resident who ran a shoe store at 265 Zhejiang Road, was previously accused of being a traitor by Chen Hui in the High Court. The High Court ruled that since the defendant did not hold any positions in the enemy or puppet organizations, nor did he participate in groups affiliated with the puppet organizations, and it could not be proven that he had conspired with the enemy, his arrest of the plaintiff together with the enemy police, whether out of coercion or willingness, was difficult to punish as treason. However, his suspicion of obstructing the freedom of others was quite serious, and jurisdiction was in error, and he should be transferred to the local court for trial. It is learned that the plaintiff has now hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the civil court, demanding that the defendant compensate for incidental civil damages totaling 132.31 million yuan, stating that the plaintiff once worked underground, and the defendant betrayed his conscience, causing his wife and children to scatter. In October of the same year, his father committed suicide by jumping off a building, leading to the destruction of his family. This case was heard yesterday, with the lawyer acting on behalf of the plaintiff, and a re-examination is guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Courts Report to Ministry on Prisoners Eligible for Amnesty</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Since the promulgation of the National Government's amnesty decree, preparations have been underway.

<h3>French Tram Still Moving at a Snail's Pace: Round Trip Takes Nearly Four Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter's Special Report] When the French Tram was not "slow-working," vehicles on the Jinling East Road section from Ba Xian Qiao to the Bund were as congested as weaving shuttles. The bell rang all day long, constantly making you feel extremely nervous. But these days are different. Although the road is still as congested as before, the tight ringing of the tram bell has been reduced, reduced to only two or three crisp and slow rings within an hour.</p>
<p>Looking down the long Xiafei Road, you can see rows of trams moving slowly. Some say they are "bull-pacing," but in fact, although "bull-pacing" is slow, it is much faster than the "slow-working" trams that stop and go. If you don't believe it, try it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter took a long "bull-pace trip." At 1:43 pm, I boarded the No. 2 tram, starting from the first station at 16 Pu, stopping at 18 stations along the way. After arriving at Xujiahui, I waited for half an hour and then returned on the same tram, arriving at 16 Pu at 5:23 pm! The average stop time per station on the way out was more than one minute, but the situation was very different on the return trip. There were dark crowds of people waiting for the bus at each station,挤满在站 [packed in the station]. The car was already completely impassable. Few people got off the bus when it arrived at the station, but many people wanted to get on, so they desperately squeezed onto the bus. Even if they couldn't squeeze on, they refused to step back, leaving half of their bodies hanging outside the bus. The ticket inspector, citing compliance with the company's regulations,任乘客們去擠 [allowed the passengers to squeeze], so the delay was prolonged again and again, and it was already dusk when I returned to 16 Pu. It is said that if it were not for the "slow-working," a one-way trip would only take 35 minutes.</p>
<p>When the tram was moving, it was also moving slowly, without the feeling of lightning and wind of the past. A woman in her forties came up to me on Ferguson Road. The small basket she was carrying was already squeezed flat. She不停地问電車走慢 [constantly asked why the tram was moving slowly], whether it was because of insufficient power. Several people in the car felt bored and got off to walk. I poked my head out of the window to look at them, and their backs gradually disappeared from me.</p>
<p>The ticket inspectors and drivers all seemed listless. Anxious people sighed in the car, and some simply leaned against the car wall and started snoring!</p>
<p>It is said that with this "slow-working," the capital's losses have been cut in half. This fare money has been transferred to the rickshaw and rickshaw pullers. From Ferguson Road to the Bund, the fare is at least 5,000 yuan!</p>
<h3>Robbery on the Republic Road Last Night: Losses Reach Over 20 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Last night at around 6:00 pm, more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived at the Tongda Company and Jiande Bank inside 269 Republic Road Xin Kai He Kou. All of them were wearing Russian hats and holding wooden shell guns and other military equipment.拥人入内 [crowding into the interior], the bandits first tied up the staff of the two companies with hemp ropes and confined them in a room, with one bandit guarding them with a weapon, forbidding them from moving. The remaining bandits broke into the accounting room,翻箱倒篐 [ransacking boxes and cabinets], and as a result, 21 million yuan in legal tender was robbed, along with four gold rings on the staff's hands. They took the stolen goods and escaped at around 7:00 pm. After receiving the news, the Huangpu Branch ordered the police to rush to the scene, but the bandits had already escaped far away.</p>
<h3>Private Newspapers Petition Again: Hope to Simplify Loan Procedures</h3>
<p>Twelve private newspapers in Shanghai, facing financial difficulties at the end of the year, jointly requested an emergency loan of 30 million yuan each from Executive Yuan President Song and Central Propaganda Department Minister Zhang. President Song approved the request for the Four Banks Joint Office to handle, and Minister Peng verbally agreed to find a way to expedite its realization. Yesterday, the Four Banks Joint Office sent a telegram to each newspaper instructing them to directly contact the Central Trust Bureau to handle the loan procedures. However, the loan methods still require oil,墨紙張 [ink, paper] as collateral, or bank acceptance, and the private newspapers have no surplus items other than those supplied for their own use to mortgage. Therefore, the newspapers believe that this loan method is no different</p>

<p>The Ancestral Master at the Top of Mount Wudang - The Chu Overlord on the Crest of the Qinling Mountains - The Mystery of Li Xiannian's Flight to the West</p>
<p>Zhengzhou, January 3rd (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Fan Shiqin from this newspaper in Zhengzhou - After Li Xiannian, former commander of the Communist Central Plains Military Region, was redesignated as the guerrilla commander of the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi border region, where exactly did he go? It remains a mystery. Since Li Xiannian fled westward from the Guangshan-Luoshan area in southern Henan to the border region of Shaanxi and Hubei, crossing the Dan River, there has been no definitive news for half a year. Some say he was killed in action, some say he disappeared, some say he disguised himself and fled to Yan'an, and others say he is still hiding in the Qinling-Funiu Mountains. What is the truth? It remains as mysterious as ever.</p>
<p>Li Xiannian, leading thirty to fifty thousand troops, engaged in a westward flight that could be called a grand "Long March." His ambitions were also quite considerable; presumably, he wanted to be the ancestral master at the top of Mount Wudang, the Chu Overlord on the crest of the Qinling Mountains, and Brother Song in the Funiu Mountains. However, those places are truly barren and the people impoverished. Bringing a large force there means that even if they are not captured by the Nationalist army, they will be exhausted by the demons and monsters in those desolate mountains. To say nothing of the fact that to reach Mount Wudang, one must get on all fours and climb like a dog; to reach the top of the Qinling Mountains, one must wind around eighty or ninety spiral roads for several days; and to get into the Funiu Mountains, one must cross more than forty rivers every day for a week. This is enough to make Li Xiannian suffer. Therefore, during his westward flight, his soldiers deserted in droves, their first words being, "Give me food first, then talk." Indeed, at that time, the Nationalist army had a complete supply line, and even then, they sometimes had to rely on airplanes to drop food.</p>
<p>If they could struggle, they would always try to struggle. Not long after Li Xiannian crossed the Dan River, he established the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi Military Region, with five military sub-regions under its command, and simultaneously established the Wudang Military Region, with four sub-regions under its command. The former was prepared to operate in the area between the Qinling and Funiu Mountains, while the latter was prepared to operate on both sides of the Laohekou-Baihe highway. To gallop among these mountains and reign supreme in this vast countryside was also a matter of pride in his disappointment. Within the twenty-nine counties of the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi border region, they probably left their footprints everywhere, but they never set foot in a single county seat.</p>
<p>Ambitious</p>
<p>The Yan'an authorities once ordered Li Xiannian to contact the "underground army" in the Shangnan-Wei area, seize the Qinling Mountains, cut off transportation between Shaanxi and Hubei, and also collude with the bandits in southern Shaanxi, while inciting the people, preparing to take Tongguan in the north and exit Lantian in the west, in order to coordinate with the Communist army in northern Shaanxi to seize the entire province. "The situation of the world is calculated from Chang'an." If this were achieved, wouldn't the situation of the world be in hand? Chang'an should not suffer disaster. During the war, the enemy tried every means to take Chang'an, but ultimately failed. Of course, it is also impossible for the Communist army to try every means to take it.</p>
<p>Now, the first military sub-region under the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi Military Region of the Communist army, led by Wu Shi'an, and the fifth military sub-region, led by Wang Anshan, have completely collapsed, and the Wudang Military Region has only two or three people left.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, Li Xiannian also had some achievements. For example, his first policy after his westward flight was to incorporate bandits, which he did successfully. For example, bandit leader Wang Lie from Lantian became the commander-in-chief of the Wei, Hua, Lan, Wei, and Shang five counties, and bandit leader Gong Defang from Luonan became the commander of the second military sub-region of the Qinling Mountains. There were many other bandit leaders who became regimental or battalion commanders. His second policy was to "establish local political power." He had his plans and methods, but they were not fully realized. For example, he planned to establish a base area in the area of Lushi, Luoning, Lingbao, and Shan County, dividing it into three county-level central districts: the area west of Guandaokou was to be the Luling County, the area south of Guandaokou was to be the Luoluo County, and the Luolu County was to be established in Mutonggou. This was one of his plans. His methods included a land tax of one dou and five sheng of unhusked rice per mu per year (or three thousand yuan, or one zhang and five chi of homespun cloth, or three jin of cotton), and a reduction of 20% to 50% in business and sales taxes (but not including loans). The township offices and lower-level organizations were allowed to mediate cases, expand local autonomy, welcome outsiders to participate, and educational institutions were not to be garrisoned by troops. However, none of these things were actually implemented.</p>
<p>Wearing a Fox Skin</p>
<p>To explain the methods he promoted and his actual actions, we can look at two recent letters he wrote to people. In one case, a middle school in Xi'an sent a batch of medicines from Zhengzhou for disaster relief, but they were intercepted by Li Xiannian's troops. They left a letter saying, "We need these medicines very much, and we have nowhere to buy them, so we borrowed them. Originally, we wanted to give you some compensation, but we don't have the funds." The other letter was written to a local gentry in Luonan, saying, "We must ask you, sir, to emulate the ancients like Xu Shu, and give us more care! Please alleviate the suffering of the people, do not harm the Communist army personnel, and do not persecute the people who assist the Communist army... Otherwise, it will be difficult to guarantee the safety of your life and property." In the world, there are cases of foxes wearing tiger skins, and naturally there are also cases of tigers wearing fox skins.</p>
<p>A Man of the Hour</p>
<p>However, Li Xiannian can be considered a prominent figure in central China in recent years. After Wuhan was occupied by the enemy, Li came from Yan'an with dozens of cadres to Gouzhu, where he and Wang Laohan together established a teaching brigade with forty or fifty people and guns. Later, he did not cooperate with Zhang Xueshi. At that time, after Gao Jingting was killed, Li advocated the armed reorganization of the Hubei Communist army, forming a column called six regiments. When the New Fourth Army Incident occurred, Li seized the opportunity to be promoted to the commander of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army, ambushing the Fourth Regiment of the Eastern Hubei Security Force, annexing the puppet army of Wang Buqing, and expanding into the 13th, 14th, and 15th Brigades. Thus, he established the military sub-region, the Security Command, and the Henan-Hubei border region administrative office. Originally, he was also the secretary-general of the Henan-Hubei border region party committee, but after Zheng Weisan was sent from Yan'an, he stepped down to become the deputy secretary-general. Regarding his background, some say he was a carpenter, and others say he was always in the Communist army. It is not necessary to concern ourselves with that, but after his westward flight this time, his whereabouts are indeed unknown. He crossed the Dan River, and it is unlikely that he was killed in action, because since then there has been no major contact between the Nationalist and Communist sides. If he had really been killed in action or disappeared, his troops might have completely disintegrated. It is more likely that he disguised himself and went to Yan'an or is hiding in the Qinling-Funiu Mountains. Now, Li's whereabouts have been located, saying that he is under the Rose Tree Village in southwestern Lushi, which shows that he has been hiding for some time. There are still rumors about him going to Yan'an, saying that he went twice, once disguised as a Nationalist army major general, and once disguised as a merchant, but these are just rumors. No matter how much Li Xiannian has the ability to be in multiple places at once and hide himself, the general trend of his westward flight is destined for his failure. The Yan'an authorities recently decided to transfer him to northern China. This is very likely, because the Yan'an authorities originally decided to establish a base area in the northeast and northwest under the cover of northern China, and after the base area was established, withdraw from northern China (including Yan'an). They have changed this to establishing base areas in the northeast and northwest, while strengthening the base areas in northern China.</p>
<p>A Dream of Crossing the River</p>
<p>Li Xiannian now probably has more than ten thousand people left, most of whom are local bandits who have been incorporated. These bandits certainly do not want to be taken away, because the capital for making trouble must still be placed between the Qinling, Funiu, and Wudang Mountains. Then he has to take some of his close troops to cross the Yellow River. There have been several attempts to cross the Yellow River, but they were driven back near the Longhai Railway. He originally wanted to send the remaining eighth regiment of the third brigade of the first column, led by Min Zijian, the troops of Wang Shicheng, and part of the sixth regiment, together with the independent regiment reorganized from the local team in Suixian County led by Huang Lin, commander of the Henan Military Region, and more than 4,000 cadres in the training team, to fly across the Yellow River. Now, we have to see how he flees again.</p>

<p>Prospects for Municipal Administration in Beiping</p>
<p>He Siyuan</p>
<p>Among China's famous metropolises, if Nanjing is the heart of Chinese politics and Shanghai is the nerve center of the Chinese economy, then Beiping can be said to be the soul of Chinese culture. Beiping is the city with the richest collection of Chinese old and new cultures. It possesses historical honors and characteristics, and was the capital of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. It still preserves some beautiful scenery and magnificent architecture. At the same time, Beiping is also the center of educational institutions. Here, there are social celebrities and specialized scholars who diligently strive for culture and academics throughout the year. Therefore, Beiping is not only a city that the Chinese people can be proud of, but the name "Beiping" is also the most tempting term internationally. It is precisely because it possesses such great vertical and horizontal value that since I took office in this city, I have been deeply vigilant in addition to being delighted, hoping not to fail the mission given to this world-famous city and the times.</p>
<p>Beiping During the Occupation</p>
<p>Since the invasion of the enemy, this international famous city has unfortunately been in ruins for eight years. Looking at it today, although the external appearance has not suffered significant damage, the internal and intangible devastation inflicted by the enemy, even a year after victory, Beiping's vitality has still not been restored to its former state. Whether it is the economy, culture, morality, or social organization, everything has suffered great pain, and it is difficult to remedy it suddenly. During the long period of occupation, the people's living standards dropped sharply, and all production mechanisms, economic arteries, manpower, and material resources were extremely exploited and destroyed. As a result, the people are poor and their wealth exhausted, and their vitality is lost. As for the original cultural facilities and organizations, they have also been destroyed, causing the youth's morals and psychology to be miserable and passive, and from passive to hesitant and divergent, leading to depravity. In addition, the enemy and the puppets openly...[text missing]... our citizens, causing significant damage to Beiping's economy and morality. Therefore, although Beiping's appearance remains the same after the pursuit of profit, a careful examination of the reality reveals that it is suffering from a hundred diseases.</p>
<p>Beiping After Victory</p>
<p>Beiping after victory originally needed extreme recuperation and should have been quickly restored, but the greatest misfortune was that it encountered a new crisis, which had a direct and indirect impact on this famous city.</p>
<p>Beiping is a cultural city and does not prosper from industry and commerce. Therefore, everything needed by the citizens is supplied by other places and its surrounding villages. Now, due to traffic congestion and the presence of many obstacles in the suburbs, not only is it difficult to import the daily necessities of the citizens, but also the materials used for industry, commerce, and restoration cannot be transported in continuously. As a result, the lives of the citizens are becoming more and more difficult, industry and commerce are becoming more and more depressed, and the number of refugees from the surrounding counties entering the city is increasing, and the daily necessities of the citizens are becoming more and more expensive. It is impossible to save money and impossible to find new sources of income. Therefore, the living burden of the citizens has invisibly increased. Furthermore, due to the poor environment in the surrounding areas and the lack of pacification of bandits, the disturbance to the citizens' spirit is difficult to describe. Frankly speaking, Beiping after victory, although nominally restored, is actually suffering more in its inner spirit and material difficulties than before. Thinking of this, I feel extremely saddened.</p>
<p>Beiping in the Future</p>
<p>How Beiping in the future, that is, Beiping in the plan or in hope, will develop, is our responsibility. I have always advocated that governance should involve less talk and more action, because it is more practical to do without saying than to say without doing. However, some things must be planned before starting in order to proceed step by step and reach the goal to achieve the expected results. Otherwise, it will be like a rudderless boat or a bridleless horse, and there will be nowhere to go. Now, I will briefly discuss what I have carefully considered, in order to ask for advice from fellow compatriots who care about Beiping, and also to encourage myself.</p>
<p>There are two key points in the goals of the municipal administration work in Beiping: (1) to restore the old foundation (recovery), and (2) to establish a new foundation (construction), and to follow these two points to achieve the ultimate goal of building a free, democratic, and prosperous Beiping. As for the focus of the work, it can be divided into three stages: (1) from the time of receiving the city in the 34th year to the present, it can be further divided into two stages, first, receiving and organizing (emphasizing receiving), and second, organizing and constructing (both are equally important); (2) this year (the 36th year) is still a stage of organization, and will focus on construction; (3) construction goals: "freedom, democracy, and prosperity" to seek the concrete realization of the Three Principles of the People in Beiping. The principles for implementing the work: (1) to handle recovery work in accordance with central laws and regulations, taking into account local conditions, so that the people can quickly get recuperation and the country can quickly embark on the road to construction; (2) to address the various aggressive poisons that the enemy and puppets have implemented against us in politics and economics, in order to correct the citizens' psychological thoughts and bad habits in life; (3) to organize and develop the vitality and organizational power that has been suppressed by the enemy and puppets for a long time, in order to cope with the current difficulties; (4) to organize, repair, and supplement all tangible affairs that have been destroyed by the enemy and puppets; (5) to simplify administrative procedures and eliminate all bad practices; (6) to complete local autonomy; (7) to develop the local economy.</p>
<p>In addition to what I have announced at the Provisional Council of Beiping, I will now add a few more explanations on the key items of implementation, as follows.</p>
<p>(1) In terms of civil administration: In addition to organizing Baos and Jias, training autonomous personnel, and organizing people's organizations as the basic key to government, which must be carried out vigorously in accordance with laws and regulations, what is particularly important is to pay close attention to the sufferings, hidden pains, hopes, and demands of the people, and strive to achieve the point where "what the people like, we like, and what the people hate, we hate," so that the municipal administrative staff can integrate with the people and achieve the goal of unity between officials and the people.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of education: In addition to the necessary repairs to school buildings and equipment, adjustments to funding, and improvement of teachers' salaries, improvement of teacher quality, and improvement of curriculum, more emphasis is placed on increasing the number of national schools, increasing the number of temporary middle schools, accommodating out-of-school youth, and eliminating illiteracy. Since Beiping is a cultural city and the representative of the national cultural district, the knowledge of the citizens of Beiping should be universally improved. According to Beiping, in addition to more than ten national colleges and universities and one municipal vocational school, there are currently 63 middle schools (municipal and private combined) with 28,669 students. There are 300 primary schools with 81,296 students. However, among the 1,695,204 citizens in the city, there are currently more than 140,000 children of school age. If we compare the total number of primary school students currently in school with the number of school-age children in the city, there are still more than 40% of children who are out of school. This is a major regret for a cultural city. Therefore, I believe that increasing the number of primary and secondary schools and eliminating illiteracy are imperative. In the 36th degree plan, it is planned to increase three middle schools, one normal school, and one vocational school, and implement it according to the reported recovery plan. In addition, 15 middle school classes, two normal school classes, and seven vocational classes will be added to the original secondary schools, and the funds will be allocated by the central government, and the funds for the summer vacation youth training class will be transferred. In addition, it is planned to expand nine national schools in order to reach the minimum standard of one school per Bao.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of finance and economic construction: In addition to abolishing harsh taxes, organizing tax revenue, simplifying procedures, eliminating corruption, and reducing waste, it is also planned to take from the people and use it for the people under the principle of not increasing the local burden and not burdening the central government, and also use it properly, using one penny as two pennies, to organize and build municipal administration. However, in today's situation where the autonomous financial revenue and expenditure of Beiping are too far apart (for example, the autonomous revenue in September was 55,242,110,622 yuan, while the expenditure in that month was 306,646,032,610 yuan, which is roughly the same every month), there is a feeling of having no rice to cook and being stretched thin. However, we cannot give up eating because of choking, and we must strive to find a way to support ourselves. This is the self-sufficient economic construction that is currently being planned, and it is difficult to predict its success or failure, but I hope to try it with the spirit of "only ask for cultivation, do not ask for harvest." At the very least, the following points must be promoted: (1) Establish cooperative farms and wounds, and first set up four places on public land in the suburbs, using cooperative methods to achieve the purpose of improving agriculture, in order to save Beiping's extremely backward agricultural technology. (2) Handle agricultural loans and assist farmers in obtaining loans from banks as fees for purchasing agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, and repairing damaged soil, opening ponds, and drawing wells, in order to help farmers restore their old business and promote their production. (3) Increase the production of eggs, milk, fish, meat, fruits, and vegetables, purchase excellent egg species, use incubators, and sell them to farmers at low prices in order to promote excellent egg species. Send personnel to inspect milk farms and dairy cows, protect excellent cattle species, and encourage the increase of dairy cattle. Use marine ponds inside and outside the city to raise young fish and protect their reproduction. Establish a pig farm to make good mating and sell them to farmers at low prices. Guide planting areas, sell seedlings at low prices, and guide planting. Set up vegetable gardens in the suburbs, improve seeds, and sell tools and insecticides at low prices. (4) Manage municipal parks and gardens, establish nurseries, encourage the public to afforestation, issue seedlings, and send personnel to guide planting. The above sections are all minimum plans, and it is expected that all will be completed within one year in order to achieve the effect of assisting farmers in increasing production.</p>
<p>(4) In terms of public utilities: Beiping's public utilities are all backward, and there are many that lack the conditions of a modern city. In this difficult situation where the country is poor and the local area is even poorer, it is impossible to talk about construction extravagantly, and it takes a lot of effort to maintain the status quo, but various constructions cannot be suspended due to poverty. It is planned to hire experts in the near future to design and form a company to combine Beiping's public utilities, borrow from foreign countries, or attract investment, to build a new Beiping. According to rough statistics, if it can be completed satisfactorily, the benefits will be quite large. Of course, technology and management still need to be carefully studied, but for the long-term plan, I think it is feasible.</p>
<p>(5) In terms of hygiene: The biggest hygiene problem in Beiping at present is the garbage that has been accumulated for eight years. According to reliable estimates, there are about 1.5 million tons. Calculated with the latest maximum cleaning force, 2,000 tons can be transported out every day, and it is expected to take two years to clean it up. However, the daily production is more than 1,800 tons, which has not been calculated. This huge monster accumulated by starlight is really a feeling of looking at the sea and sighing. But if this is not removed, there will be no hygiene in Beiping. Recently, a Cleanliness Movement Committee has been launched by the party, government, military, and civilians to clean up the garbage generated by everyone with everyone's strength, which can be set up in both emotion and reason. If this plan can be completed satisfactorily, there may be hope of cleaning up within half a year. In addition, Beiping does not have a perfect sewage system, and sewage removal is the most serious problem. It is almost impossible to solve it thoroughly with Beiping's current economic strength. This can only be solved in one fell swoop after the company for public utilities is realized.</p>
<p>(6) In terms of official governance: In addition to eliminating redundancy, we will try our best to eliminate the habits of meetings, rectify officialdom, cultivate new life in politics, establish a new style in politics, and expect every administrative staff of the municipal government to truly reach the level of a modern civil servant. As for all the social habits that should be improved, the municipal administrative staff must take the lead in setting an example in order to change the atmosphere of an era. In addition, the election of talented people, the elimination of turbidity, and the comprehensive examination of fame and reality, the trust of rewards and punishments will also be the central work in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, in the rational promotion and application of human and material resources, the maintenance of public security, the supply of food for the people, the renovation of the city appearance, the strengthening of security, and the promotion of land registration can all be carried out step by step. Finally, there is one thing that must be announced to the social people, that is, after I took office, I realized that most administrative organs suffer from having a top-heavy structure, with people concentrated at the top level, and no one responsible for basic-level politics. As a result, the central government's good laws and good policies are only circling around in official documents, and administrative personnel often think that they have achieved their mission if they can handle official documents well. In order to thoroughly correct this situation, I transferred capable personnel from various bureaus and offices to form an autonomous guidance group and used the power to go to the local level. It has now been officially established on December 15th, and it is expected that Beiping will have an ideal new atmosphere next year. At the very least, there will be someone to ask about and deal with things below. This hope does not seem difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>What has been described above is quite incomplete, and is not very lofty, but if these things can be fully accomplished as planned, then it can also be gratifying to the people of the country. In short, Beiping's natural conditions and social conditions have things that other cities do not have. In particular, the people of Beiping are law-abiding, honest, polite, knowledgeable, and have a clear sense of right and wrong, which is a good basis for political promotion. We are really happy to serve these 1.8 million excellent citizens. Director Li Delin has taken the safety of northern China on his shoulders, and his base in Beiping and his planning and guidance have become a stabilizing force in northern China and a powerful barrier in half of China. We believe that under his leadership, looking forward to the future, Beiping has a bright and splendid future.</p>
<p>The Anniversary of the Siege of Liaocheng</p>
<p>January 3rd (Airmail) - Special Correspondent Li Tian from this newspaper in Shandong</p>
<p>Liaocheng has been under siege by the Communist army for a whole year, with both hard attacks and soft sieges! Under the leadership of Commissioner Wang Jinxiang, the 40,000 soldiers and civilians in the city, in order to ensure its safety over the past year, sacrificed more than half of the best and most loyal souls and lives of the Chinese nation. The remaining ten thousand or so soldiers and civilians, due to difficulties in receiving supplies and malnutrition, are generally suffering from achromatopsia, leg swelling, abdominal distension, and rotten gums. Finally, on New Year's Day this year, after enduring a year of hardship, they had to wave goodbye with tears and reluctantly obey orders to voluntarily abandon the city under the cover of the Nationalist army!</p>
<p>Originally, throughout history, Liaocheng has always been a place that strategists must fight for and defend. As early as the Warring States period, when the state of Qi attacked Yan, the Yan general stubbornly defended Liaocheng, and the Qi soldiers attacked for three months, but failed to take it. During the Ming dynasty, when Wang Lun rebelled, the city was besieged for more than ninety days, but the city still stood firm. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the War of Resistance broke out, Commissioner Fan Zhuxian also used this as a base, leading hundreds of thousands of Yan-Zhao soldiers to ensure the safety of more than 30 counties in northwestern Shandong for more than a year, delaying the enemy's crossing of the river and cooperating with the Battle of Xuzhou and the battle on the periphery of Wuhan, severely damaging the enemy army. His great achievements are enough to glorify history and shine through the ages. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist Party claimed troops to carve out a separatist regime. Because Liaocheng not only controlled the western Shandong Plain geographically and was as closely connected to Jinan, the provincial capital of Shandong, as lips and teeth support each other, but also became the eastern gateway to the Communist army's Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, the Communist army had to occupy Liaocheng. Retreating could ensure the safety of the eastern side of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, and advancing could plunder Jinan at any time to prepare for seizing the three provinces of Qi. Therefore, Liaocheng was a must-attack for the Communist army. Therefore, since the enemy army surrendered in August of the 34th year, Wang Jinxiang, the administrative inspector and security commander of the sixth district of Shandong, was ordered to lead all the staff of the office and security teams to just recover Liaocheng and its subordinate counties of Boping, Renping, and Dong'a, while Tangyi, Chaocheng, and Yanggu had not yet been recovered. The Communist army, under the command of Liu Bocheng, Song Renqiong, and Yang Yong, mobilized 50,000 troops and first "liberated" more than 20 counties in northwestern Shandong, such as Yucheng, Linqing, Pingyuan, Gaotang, and Guantao. After that, Liaocheng was also on the list of being liberated. Therefore, since January 2nd of last year, they have concentrated their forces to besiege Liaocheng and Boping. Boping was captured on January 5th, and Liaocheng was attacked day and night from January 2nd to 17th without any rest. Since the 14th, the Communist army's attack has been particularly fierce. More than 20 mortars were concentrated on the southeast corner and northwest corner of the city to bombard fiercely. Finally, several places on the southeast corner of the city wall were bombed down by concentrated artillery fire. The Communist army's commando team then stepped on the ice and climbed the city, and a commando team surged up the collapsed city wall. When Commissioner Wang received this phone call in the headquarters, he immediately ordered that in addition to one adjutant, all officers and soldiers, as well as cooks and residents, with guns taking guns and without guns taking knives, all reinforced the southeast corner of the city. Finally, with the concerted efforts of the soldiers and civilians throughout the city, the Communist army that climbed the city wall fell into the moat batch after batch! The city wall was also repaired under the desperate blocking battle of the officers, soldiers, and civilians throughout the city!</p>
<p>Blood-Stained Moat - River Ice All Red</p>
<p>The Communist army repeatedly failed to capture the city. At this time, it was the fourth day after the ceasefire order took effect (January 17th). The Communist army finally temporarily stopped the attack, and the casualties on both sides in this battle were at least more than 10,000, with blood covering the moat and the river ice turning red.</p>
<p>In addition to the original 20,000 soldiers and civilians in the city of Liaocheng, there were also more than 10,000 gentry who had fled to the city from various counties in western Shandong because they could not bear the "liquidation" and "struggle," and most of them were tenant farmers and tenant farmers. There were also 4,000 to 5,000 public servants and their children and students from the Lusi Sixth and Fourth Commissioners' Offices and their subordinate counties. Naturally, Commissioner Wang's entire family was also in the city. They realized that if the city was not defended, they would all be liquidated and struggled. Instead of being liquidated and dying, it was better to die with the city. In addition, the leader Commissioner Wang graduated from the eighth term of Baoding Military Academy and had 30 years of military experience. He had been promoted to brigadier general for his merits and was known for his experience in leading troops and protecting the people. Therefore, the soldiers and civilians in the city were happy to obey orders and follow him in resisting. After the Communist army failed to capture the city, they changed to soft siege tactics, stationing troops in the towns and villages around the city to completely cut off traffic inside and outside the city, so that materials from outside the city could not be transported in. Under this kind of blockade, the soldiers and civilians in the city suffered a fate far more cruel than attacking the city.</p>
<p>The first serious problem that arose was food. The only passive solution was for the special office to implement control and make overall plans, but due to the lack of active and large-scale external supply, at the most difficult time, each soldier and civilian in the city was only supplied with four liang of moldy and rotten grain per day to fill their stomachs, and grass roots and tree bark had long been eaten up. Continuing down, fuel and clothing became a big problem. The wood of many houses was taken out to burn as firewood! Many clothes and quilts were also broken and unable to keep warm! As a result, diseases such as achromatopsia, abdominal distension, leg swelling, rotten gums, malaria, and typhoid fever occurred due to the imbalance of heat and cold and malnutrition. Due to the lack of medicine, death closely followed the disease! Watching thirty, fifty, or even more than a hundred people silently fall down every day!</p>
<p>The executive group of the military headquarters went to the city to tour last spring to mediate the siege of Liaocheng, regardless of the dangers. Driven by the sympathy of human beings, after witnessing this extremely tragic siege of the people, they decided to add eight trucks loaded with 1,000 bags of flour, 20 boxes of milk, and condolence materials from the provincial government to the second trip to relieve the suffering. However, when the car arrived in the suburbs of the east gate of Liaocheng on May 3, all the relief materials became the spoils of the Communist army, and the group members, except for the Communist representative, also became prisoners of the Communist army and were "treated favorably" in the Communist army's "detention room" for two days before being released back to Jinan.</p>
<p>The soldiers and civilians of Liaocheng spent seven months in such difficult conditions. By August of last year, the Communist army took advantage of the soaring river water and breached the dikes of the Zhe River outside the east gate and the Majia River outside the west gate in an attempt to flood the entire city, so that the soldiers and civilians in the city would be buried in the belly of the fish. Fortunately, God saw pity, and when the water level was level with the root of the city, the river water just reached a balanced state. Not only did the entire city not suffer land subsidence, but the moat outside the city was widened to two li, becoming the most favorable natural defense line of the joint city.</p>
<p>December! In this cold season, the moat outside Liaocheng was dry and frozen due to the cold weather, and even cars could come and go! This again gave the Communist army the most rare opportunity of the year. Therefore, after half a month of preparation, starting at 7 pm on December 20th, the Communist army concentrated more than 10,000 elite troops, more than 10 mortars, and one field artillery piece to attack the city again. The 10,000 soldiers and civilians in the city were awakened by the sound of artillery fire in a dying state. A kind of instinct for survival and the concept of protecting the country and defending the city once again awakened their vitality. He/She still guarded the original post and supported it for the most difficult eleven days. On the first day of this year, the elite troops sent by Commander Wang Yaowu attacked the edge of the city, and then he/she safely withdrew from Liaocheng. Arriving at Renping that night, it is estimated that it will arrive in Jinan on the evening of the 3rd. In total, from January 2nd of last year to the breakout on this year, Liaocheng was besieged for exactly a full year.</p>
<p>Liaocheng was abandoned! The fellow villagers of Liaocheng, who are traveling to Ji, collectively petitioned Commander Wang Yaowu on the 2nd, requesting to organize an armed homecoming group to fight back to their hometown. These affectionate and sensitive people who had survived the disaster, upon hearing Commander Wang describe how the Communist army "liberated" the place where their ancestors' graves were located, and that in order to rescue the more than 10,000 orphans in the city, they had to reluctantly abandon the city walls and withdraw from the city, all the petitioning villagers could not help but burst into tears!</p>

<p>There is now a kind of awkward person in Shanghai. They are neither robbers nor thieves. They are unwilling to be hooligans who hold thighs, and they are unwilling to be beggars who snatch cold rice. To catch them, they are called "incubating stone eggs," also known as "mixing tea and rice," because their lives are to get by one day at a time, and one year at a time. Some get rich, and some are like Wang Xiaoer over the New Year, getting worse every year. The titles of their professions include "Swallow's Nest Runner," "Salted Meat Partner," "Model Broker," and so on.</p>

Therefore, those who ban ban, those who smoke smoke, and the stricter the ban, the more ingenious the tricks of drug trafficking. At present, the number of illegal opium dens in Shanghai is probably more than four digits. However, the location of the opium dens is very secret, and it is not easy for non-guests to find them. In addition to regular customers, they also want to recruit new patrons, so they hire this kind of awkward person to be the runner for</p>
<h3>Burma Volunteer Army to Vietnam to Assist in Battle; Viet Minh Reiterates Determination to Resist</h3>

<h3>Standardization of British and American Military Equipment; Montgomery to Explain to the Soviets; Soviet Union Can Participate in Any Agreement Reached by Britain and the United States; Warm Reception and Harmonious Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] British Chief of the General Staff Montgomery, whose name is often associated with artillery and less so with diplomacy, has now become Britain's newest envoy. According to a report from Moscow, Montgomery will explain and reassure the Soviet Union regarding the standardization of British and American military equipment. This visit is the most important representation of British individuals to the Soviet Union in recent times, with an immense mission. The Soviet Union is quite uneasy about the standardization of British and American military equipment and has asked: "Besides the Soviet Union, what other country has such vast power that it requires Britain and the United States to jointly resist?" The United States views it as merely a normal application of the lessons learned in 1939, while the Soviet Union wants to see the underlying motive. In 1939, American industry began to specially manufacture weapons for Britain and France, and subsequently, various arms factories had to change their plans and adopt American-style equipment. The Soviet Union also knows that the unification of military equipment is related to the United States' desire to establish military bases in northern Canada. This matter has not been agreed upon because some Canadians believe that this plan will strengthen the combination of Canada and the United States while weakening the connection with Britain. However, if the entire plan includes Britain, then Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King will more easily persuade his countrymen. The Soviet Union is somewhat uneasy about the United States' plan to establish defenses in Canada. The mission of Montgomery's trip is clearly to inform the Moscow government of the following: First, there is no need to panic. Second, the standardization of military equipment between the two countries is quite reasonable from the perspective of Britain and the United States, given that the world is not yet stable. Third, the Soviet Union can participate in any transaction reached by Britain and the United States, and the door is not closed. Fourth, the military preparations of Britain and the United States are the same as the Soviet Union's intention to form a defensive ring around its weaker neighbors.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 9th] On the evening of the 9th, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky hosted Montgomery at the British Embassy. Montgomery said in his speech: "Although the Allied countries conflict in the United Nations and at peace conferences, the Allied countries are still good friends." Vyshinsky replied, "He feels that open debate among countries to discuss differing views is a big step towards the path of progress. Although there have been frequent disputes in the United Nations General Assembly and peace conferences, good friendship still exists among the Allied countries."</p>
<h3>Security Council Discusses Disarmament Issue; Verbal Battle Between the US and the USSR; Jones Insists on Prioritizing Discussion of Atomic Issue; Australia Proposes Compromise to Reconcile US-Soviet Opinions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 9th] The United Nations Security Council today launched a full debate on the issue of disarmament. Soviet representative Gromyko accused the United States of attempting to delay the implementation of a universal disarmament plan, saying that the United States' insistence on prioritizing discussion of atomic energy control implied, "If you agree with the United States' atomic control plan, then we will agree to draft the implementation steps for a universal disarmament plan. Conversely, if the United States' atomic plan cannot proceed smoothly, then we will reject the drafting of any disarmament implementation steps." At the beginning of the debate, Australian representative Makin warned that "this is not the time for disputes" and then proposed a compromise in the hope of reconciling US-Soviet disputes.</p>
<p>According to Makin's compromise, the Security Council should accept the disarmament plan passed by the United Nations General Assembly and then take three practical steps: (1) In accordance with the Soviet proposal, establish a committee to immediately discuss steps to implement the General Assembly resolution and establish international control to ensure the reduction of troops and armaments. (2) Accept the report of the Atomic Energy Commission as a blueprint for continued discussion and accelerate the establishment of an international atomic control convention. (3) The issue of the United Nations peacekeeping force should be immediately submitted to the Military Staff Committee for discussion, paying attention to the General Assembly's resolution on all member governments providing reports on military strength.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 9th] After Soviet representative Gromyko accused the United States in the Security Council of obstructing the discussion of the disarmament issue, US representative Johnson immediately refuted and insisted that the issue of atomic control should be prioritized. It was stated: "Effective international control of atomic energy is the key to the entire plan and must be discussed first. If atomic energy is not controlled first, then the control of other armaments will be difficult to achieve. From our point of view, controlling atomic energy is a test case. We believe that the Security Council should guarantee significant progress in the area of atomic issues before discussing the control and reduction of traditional armaments, which is therefore a secondary issue." Jones denied that the United States intended to delay and said that the United States was prepared to agree to the arms adjustment plan, but on the condition that the atomic issue be prioritized for discussion.</p>

<h3>New Fishing Method: No Hooks, Bait, or Nets; Using Sound Waves to Lure Fish into Shells</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Japanese fishermen will soon use a new fishing method that does not require nets. Recently, Dr. Taguchi and others invented a sound generator, which will change traditional fishing methods, making hooks, bait, and nets obsolete. The method involves installing a machine on fishing boats to emit strange noises, driving the fish towards the shore. Then, another machine is used to emit beautiful music, luring the fish and making them easy to catch in their confusion. According to Dr. Taguchi, we already know that fish have special reactions to certain sounds, and the latest technology is simply a scientific application of this knowledge. Some sounds are liked by fish, while others are not. Americans have used sound to find where herring live. Now, Japan will be the first to use sound waves to catch fish.</p>

<h3>Forcibly Occupying District Offices; Humiliating and Beating Senators; Illegal Atrocities by Soldiers; General Assembly Unanimously Indignant; Resolution on Three Cases Demanding Strict Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The City Senate held its fourth meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss four important temporary motions: (1) Personnel of the Garrison Headquarters insulted District Chief and Senator Hou Junren of the 12th District and forcibly occupied the residence of Senator Lu Huimin. (2) Slow operation of the French-owned tramway. (3) Slum shantytowns. (4) Telegram to the entire country supporting the Constitution. All four cases were discussed and passed by the General Assembly. During the meeting, the directors of the Finance, Land Administration, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus responded to the inquiries from the third meeting. At the same time, six civil affairs proposals were discussed. Senator Li Wenjie reported on the 35th-year budget revision, which was passed by the General Assembly and will be formally notified to the city government.</p>
<p>[Further Report] Regarding the three temporary motions proposed by City Senator Jiang Huaisu and dozens of others in the General Assembly yesterday, all of which were related to the incident in the morning when Inspector Zhang Yamin of the Garrison Headquarters forcibly occupied the District Office at No. 12 Zhonghua Xincun, Xinza Road, District Chief and Senator Hou Junren reported the details to the General Assembly. It was stated that No. 12 Zhonghua Village was the property of the traitor Zhou Bangjun, which they were in charge of managing. Inspector Zhang Yamin of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters and his family also lived in the same house. In the morning, Senators Lu and Hou were both attending the Small Review Committee of the City Senate when they returned home and saw that Zhang had led a dozen armed personnel and thrown all the furniture and documents from Lu's residence and the District Office out into the street. When Lu negotiated with him, Zhang actually said, "I'll beat you to death." District Chief Hou was also beaten and nearly tied up. Later, the district police station was notified and the mayor was asked to intervene. After the mayor issued a handwritten order, they were persuaded and mediated, and allowed to move the items back. Speaker Pan and all senators expressed that military and police personnel were acting so recklessly, openly infringing on local autonomous institutions, and insulting the District Chief of the District Office and City Senators, then the unlawful maltreatment of ordinary citizens who have no one to turn to can be imagined. If citizens cannot live and work in peace, how can it be called a "city"? Strict measures must be taken to stop this. The General Assembly resolved three points to be handed over to the responsible authorities for investigation: (1) Request the municipal government to notify all military, police, and security agencies in the city to strictly prohibit the atrocities of soldiers. (2) The Senate will send a letter to the Garrison Headquarters requesting that these unlawful soldiers be strictly investigated and punished. (3) The Senate expresses its deep indignation at the insult suffered by Senator Hou Junren and Senator Lu Huimin at the hands of unlawful soldiers, and the responsible authorities should express their apologies to the Senate in writing.</p>
<h3>Increase Electricity and Phones; Solutions Will Be Available This Year; Decision to Relax Electricity Usage Limits Starting Next Month; Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Answers Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue gave oral answers to the inquiries from the senators at the General Assembly yesterday: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau's management policy for foreign companies is to respect contracts, enforce laws, improve management, and increase efficiency. Foreign and Chinese companies are treated equally. All foreign companies have good cooperation. (2) The restriction on electricity usage for lights had originally been decided to be cancelled from February 1st, removing the 70% discount and the minimum 20-unit limit. The actual electricity consumption in November of the previous year will be used as the standard, but it must not be exceeded, and those consuming less than 30 units will be allowed to use up to 30 units. The penalty will also be changed to a warning system, with electricity being cut off after three warnings. When electricity increases slightly in the near future, it will be further relaxed to outdoor neon lights, which was also decided in consultation yesterday to be opened from April 1st. (3) The frequent power outages in the Nanshi district are due to a malfunction in one of the power company's generators. (4) The crackdown on rickshaws is being carried out under central government orders. The rickshaws that have been drawn and eliminated have been converted into three-wheeled vehicles, still driven by the original rickshaw pullers, so the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers is not a problem. (5) The number of buses has been increased to more than 120. The number of trams has also increased from 332 to 386. (6) The Shanghai Telephone Company has ordered 10,000 new lines from France, and one unit will arrive in Shanghai in mid-February. (7) The problem of slow connections with the "02" telephone line will be addressed by ordering the Shanghai Telephone Company to pay attention to improvements. (8) The installation of streetlights will be completed before January of this year. (9) The issue of adjusting the tram routes involves demolishing houses to widen the roads and requisitioning land, which is being referred to the central government for instructions. (10) The number of vehicles in the city has increased by 14,861 three-wheeled vehicles compared to before the war, which did not exist before the war. The biggest reason for the city's traffic congestion is the concentration of vehicles in the central district after the city was unified. As for the zonal traffic management method, it has been submitted by the mayor to the General Assembly for discussion. (11) The restriction on three-wheeled vehicles and other vehicles passing through the Garbage Bridge was originally a temporary measure to solve traffic congestion. They can still pass before 8:00 AM and after 6:00 PM. After the Public Works Bureau repairs the Wenzaobang Bridge within a month, it will be opened. (12) The problem of the 160 yuan change for ferry tickets at the Dongchang Road Wharf has been changed to 200 yuan from December 11th, while the long-distance fares have been reduced. As for the attitude of the staff, the ferry company will be ordered to correct it, and citizens are encouraged to report any issues. (13) The issue of connecting electricity to shantytowns before obtaining a construction permit is that in principle, builders should obtain a construction permit before starting construction, and the installation of electric lights in new buildings should be carried out at the same time as the construction project. This bureau has no restrictions.</p>
<p>Central Work This Year</p>
<p>[Our Report] Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue said in the Senate yesterday that the central tasks of the Public Utilities Bureau this year are: (1) To increase electric power by more than 50,000 kilowatts. This bureau will do its best to increase it to meet the needs of the citizens. (2) To enrich other public utilities, such as the city's telephones, which have a five-year expansion plan to add 10,000 numbers. The water supply problem in the West Shanghai is also being solved, and the British gas company needs it. (3) To organize the wharf warehouses. Recently, it is planned to establish Nanshi Wharves Nos. 1 to 9 to restore the pre-war state. (4) To strengthen public transportation, it is planned to add 120 buses to the routes opened and operated by the former British-owned Public Bus Company in ten years, which this bureau is determined to complete this year.</p>
<h3>Petitions Abound; Stall Vendors Demand Full-Day Opening; Students Request Preservation of Drama School</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Nearly a hundred stall vendors from the Huangpu and Laoza districts again petitioned the City Senate yesterday, claiming that they are still being arrested by the police for setting up stalls in designated areas, with fines of 5,000 yuan each time, even several times a day. The General Assembly then dispatched Senators Tang Shichang and Zhu Yakui to meet with them. The stall vendors put forward two requests: (1) The authorities designated July 20th for setting up stalls, but after the stall vendor incident, they were only allowed to set up stalls from 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM, but business is slow during this time, so they are requesting a full-day opening. (2) They are requesting that the Social Affairs Bureau be asked to approve the organization of a fellowship association for stall vendors in the Huangpu and Laoza districts. Senators Tang and Zhu promised to convey this intention to the municipal authorities. According to Mayor Wu, a method for dealing with the establishment of stalls has been drafted and submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. Once the results are available, the entire stall vendor problem in the city will be solved, not just the Huangpu and Laoza districts.</p>
<p>Also, students from the Municipal Experimental Drama School lined up to petition the City Senate yesterday, stating their reasons for requesting the preservation of the Drama School. Senators Tong Xingbai and Zhou Feicheng met with them, stating that they had no right to decide and promising to submit the matter to the General Assembly for discussion. In addition, those who came to the meeting to petition included the Shanghai Business Association and male and female workers from the Wing On Textile Factory.</p>
<p>(3) The reason why the business tax has not been accelerated for collection is that most of it is stall vendors. To take care of the livelihood of the small vendors, it has been specially postponed until after the end of the lunar year before it is collected. (4) The reason why it is not easy for suburban schools to receive funds is because there are only three people handling the distribution of funds. The schools have been accumulating payments for a long time, so they are too busy at once, and the order is difficult to maintain. At the same time, according to central government regulations, the procedures for withdrawing funds are too complicated, which delays a lot of time. As for the attitude of the staff, it will be strictly reprimanded and improved. (5) The deadline for municipal construction donations and fines is three weeks after delivery. If fines are paid before the deadline, they should be refunded, such as the amount wrongly fined to Senator Tang Shichang, which has been refunded after investigation. (6) It has recently been discovered that there are cases of people posing as the Finance Bureau to sell business tax laws and housing donation receipts to the outside world. Investigations have been carried out, but there have been no results. However, the Finance Bureau never sends personnel to sell any items, and the collection of funds is also handled by the accounting department, so if such incidents are discovered, please report them immediately. (7) More than 6 billion yuan was received for municipal construction donations last year, but it did not exceed the budget, because other departments collected less than expected.</p>
<p>According to Director Gu, the city's public bonds currently include (1) two types of old municipal government bonds, which have been ordered to be registered with the four banks and await disposal. The principal and interest due at the end of the 35th year are more than 36 million yuan, which will be allocated from this year's budget using tax revenue as collateral. (2) Six types of former International Settlement bonds, with principal and interest due in the 35th year of more than 14 million yuan, have been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Public Settlement and French Concession Official Assets and Obligations Debt Clearing Committee for handling. (3) Eleven types of former French Municipal Council bonds are also being actively cleared.</p>

<p>Both are Loyal Readers of This Newspaper</p>
<p>This newspaper recently received a notice from the US Department of the Army in Washington, stating that two of our Air Force personnel sent to the United States for internships have now completed flying the P-51 aircraft and will return to the country soon, and that the two pilots are loyal readers of this newspaper and hope that this news will be published in this newspaper so that their parents can learn about it. The names of the two pilots are Gu Xuanwen and Xiang Hanlan, and their Shanghai mailing addresses are No. 61, Lane 1136, Yuyuan Road, and No. 27, Lane 345, Mayback Road.</p>
<h3>Shantytowns Neither Built Nor Demolished; Tunnel Planned to be Built Across the Huangpu River; Director of the Public Works Bureau Answers Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang answered the oral inquiries of the senators the other day: (1) The shantytown problem is a whole social and economic problem. The Public Works Bureau must consider three issues: the housing of civilians, public safety, and whether there is any conflict with the land rights of the owners. From beginning to end, the Public Works Bureau has no strict crackdown measures, and the crackdown is not necessarily demolition. Currently, in the prohibited construction zone, the principle of "neither build nor demolish" is adopted, that is, those that already exist will not be demolished, but new ones are not allowed to be built. So far, a total of seven ongoing shantytowns have been cracked down on, and the homeowners have all been able to listen to the advice. It is hoped that the City Senate can entrust the shantytown problem to the municipal government for handling, and give instructions at any time. The municipal government will definitely take care of all parties and give everyone a satisfactory answer. (2) According to accurate investigations, there are a total of 8,327 households in shantytowns in the prohibited construction zone, and 63,762 households in the non-prohibited zone, totaling 72,089 households, of which only 3,053 have obtained licenses from the Public Works Bureau. (3) Regarding the dredging of river channels, the engineering technology is the responsibility of the Public Works Bureau, and the planning and recruitment of workers is the responsibility of the district offices. Among the first-class trunk rivers, the Huangpu River is the responsibility of the Dredging Bureau, and the Suzhou Creek is subsidized by the Public Works Bureau for part of the expenses. The Wenzaobang has already been surveyed and does not need to be dredged this year. In addition, there are more than ten second-class rivers, and seven or eight of them will be dredged this year. (4) For the Huangpu River Bridge, the technical research cannot be handled by the personnel of the Public Works Bureau, so it has been handed over to the China Bridge Company for design, and it is proposed that: a low-level movable bridge would cost 46 billion, a tunnel would cost 79 billion, and a high-level fixed bridge across Shanghai would not be suitable. After research, although the engineering cost of the tunnel is greater than that of the low-level movable bridge, it is the best in all respects. The review has been submitted to the Huangpu River Crossing Project Committee for discussion. The location, capacity, and cost of the wharf need to be planned and researched. (5) In the past year, more than 1 million square meters of road projects have been repaired. Due to poor materials and too many vehicles passing by, at least 200,000 square meters have been damaged and repaired again. There are currently more than 2 million square meters that have not been repaired. The reason for only repairing the middle of the road and not the sides is due to materials and funding, because the middle of the road must bear the weight of large trucks, while the sides only have rickshaws. (6) The project to remove the obstacles left by the enemy and puppet regime in a part of the Nanshi area is still under negotiation because it has not been approved by the local military authorities.</p>
<h3>Wrongly Fined Construction Donations Should Be Refunded; Director of the Finance Bureau Answers Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan said at the General Assembly yesterday in response to inquiries: (1) Regarding the investigation of grain registers, start by registering grain households so that all land in the old tax register can be found with the real household name, mu points, and address. However, paying grain cannot be recognized as the owner. If they are the owner, they must still go to the Land Administration Bureau to register. (2) Public property consolidation: the city government's public property is managed separately by various bureaus and offices and has not yet been fully collected. The rental income from city-owned houses in December was more than 188 million yuan. There are currently 22 municipal vegetable markets, with a collection of more than 8.87 million yuan.</p>
