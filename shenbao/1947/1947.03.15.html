<h3>農安德惠展開激戰</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十四日下午八時電〕長春衛星之一之晨安攻守戰，刻已展開。德惠縣城亦在共軍圍攻中。東北共軍似圖於四外長會議期間一展身手，以炫惑國際視聽，國軍當亦不致輕易放過擊　東北共軍主力之大好機會。連日松江地區大雪紛飛，軍事行動略受稽遲，然國軍預定之部署，仍如時完成，今後一百小時，當為最具決定性之時間。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕良經濟緊急措施方案頒布至今已達一月，表面上經濟界混亂情形賴以稍得鎭定，惟據某經濟專家觀察，此時未許完全樂觀，蓋市面游資正在徘徊觀望時期，苟無適當方怯導之納於生產正軌，則仍難望收大效，一般檢討以為今後經濟政策首宜設怯恢復政府之信用，在方針和制度方面，須下大決心，以事實表示，政府決不失信於民，而一切辦法尤當體恤民艱，萬勿斤斤與民爭利，必使生產發展，則人能盡其才，他能盡其利，物能盡其用，貨能暢其流。總之，經濟政策，必以民生主義為依歸，方能活躍，若徒知聚歛，決非國家理財之這，聞中樞當局已對此有深切之感覺，此為三中全會以前之較好氣象。</p>

<h3>張君勱談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨張君勱氏對於莫斯科會議，昨發表書面意見稱：近日因蘇外長莫洛托夫提出中國問題應列入讓事日程一點，引起世界注目，尤其吾國內函電交馳，表示吾國內政不容他國干涉。此自為國際　上之根本原則，為任何國家所應共守。然嚴格言之，莫氏之提議，旣被目為內政之干涉，則上次俄京三外長之聲明，與夫美國總統杜魯門之聲明，何嘗不是對於吾國內政之評責。語曰：「國必自侮，而後人侮之」。又曰：「止謗莫如自修」。國人反對國際干涉之論固是，然尤須進一步求吾國政治澈底民主化，內戰停止，聯合政府成立，則四強方且歡迎我蒞俄京之不暇，伺至拒我國代表之出席。近日國內與論多側重於反對國際干涉，換言之，不許討論中國問題。我則以爲苟中國不派代表，自然不容他國討論，然四强旣已同意非正式討論中國問題，則吾國應即通吿參加，為堂堂正正之　護，萬不可採「拒人千里外」之能度。中國問題為世界問題之一部分，中國而和平，即世界可以和平，吾國應立籌劃參加俄京會議之代表團，如孫院長科與王外長世杰出席最為相宜。所採方針：（一）加强中蘇之友好關係。（二）明吿俄國，中美問無任何密的，以圖反蘇。（三）中國不統一，將為美蘇友誼之障碳與世界和平之導火綫。（四）東北撤兵與中長路交通之恢復。（五）中國願以政治方式解決共產黨問題。A實行整軍方案，B共黨參加政府，C各省行政須在憲法範圍之內。以上五項，誠由我國代表團向四　解釋明白，不獨吾國內政可以走上和平與統一之路，即對蘇美友誼與世界和平，而將有所貢獻，或者有人反對，以為此為吾國內政，無須向外人聲辯，然無論我國如何反對，四國定將此問題提出討論。與其秘密不如明朗，與其讓人家討論，不如我自身參加，與其此一膿泡埋伏在內，不如讓他在光天化日中表露一下。此為吾國外交與世界政局上一大關鍵，望吾朝野平心思之。</p>
<h3>參加外長會建議立法院決議撤銷</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立院十四日晨討論當前外交問題時，陳安仁等立委大聲的呼「外交應爭取主動」，對莫斯科會議將於會內外討論我內政問題一點，僉主不應派遣代表參加。今日會塲空氣激昂熱烈，掌聲時自四處傳出。外决甘乃光亦應邀列席，報吿對當前外交措施，並作詳細分析，此一重要問題係因陳安仁等委員所提「要求根據波茨坦會議決讓案，派遣代表參加外長會議」一案所引起。討論結果，僉認政府當局旣已宣布不派代表參加，原案似無成立必要，決議予以撤銷。</p>
<h3>我政府重申立塲　決不派代表參加外長會　美代表聲稱將改變計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕可靠方面息：我政府十四日晨經由外交途徑，通知美·英·蘇·法四國，重申我國對莫斯科會議所採立塲，明白表示無論於會內會外討論中國問題，中國決不派代表參加。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫曾提議召集英美蘇會議，並邀請中國參加，以考慮一九四五年三國外長對華聲明之執行情形。頃據中國官方表示，中國政府之態度，業於前日王外長聲明由劉切宣示。中國政府已拒絕接受上項提議，蓋中國旣非一九四五年三外長對華聲明之參加者，而且該項聲明涉及中國內政，在發表之時，實為中國人民所灤切反對。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕國民參政會駐會委會十四日上午九時舉行第十八决會議，由莫德惠主席，臨時請王外長作外交報吿，王氏對有關草斯科外長會議等事項，曾作詳細說明。嗣即討論提案，當通過要案多件，此次參政員所提反對四國外畏干涉我國內政之提案共有五件，經合併討論後，並決議通過送請政府迅速辦理。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十三日電〕我駐蘇大使傅秉常，今晨訪馬歇爾國務卿，晤談半小時。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十四日電〕中國駐蘇大使傳秉常，今晨再度訪問英外相員文，重申中國政府反對英·美·蘇外長對中國內政出以任何討論。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十四日廣播：美代表稱：中國政府反對參加討論中國局勢，且拒絕　派代表前來蘇京，此事勢將改動目前計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十四日廣播：據可靠消息，美，英，蘇，三國外長將於日內與中國代表討論中國局勢。</p>

<h3>貝祖詒等違法瀆職監院發表彈劾原文　參政會請政府速依法嚴辦</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕參政會駐會委員會今日開會時，曾討論羅衡等提請政府嚴懲前中央銀行主管負責人貝　詒·林鳳苞·楊安仁等三人，為此次利用職權，官商勾結，破壞國策，非法圖利，有意造成黄金風潮，刺激物價，致妨害民生，動搖政府威信，應即交付司法機關依法嚴辦，以肅官　，而儆效允案。決議通過，送請政府迅速切實辦理。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕奉命調查金潮之監察委員何漢文·萬燦·谷鳳翔·張慶楨四氏，於向監院提出詳細調查報吿後，近復依據調查所得，認為中央銀行前總裁員祖詒，業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，襄理王松濤等違法凟職，向監察院提出彈劾案，此案經監察院交付監察委員金毓黻·王子弦·于樹德審查，提出審查報吿，請將貝祖詒等移付懲戒，其彈劾案原文及審查報吿，監院於十四日發表。茲誌彈劾案原文如下：</p>
<p>彈劾案原文</p>
<p>為彈劾事：查此次黄金風潮，影響國計民生，至深且鉅，委員等奉命調查金潮情形，經澈查中央銀行對於執行買賣黄金業務之實際情形，僉以該行總裁貝祖詒，業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁等，有下列違法失職之事實：</p>
<p>情弊灼然可見</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行之存金底數，關係國家機密，允於黄金政策實施之前途，有重大影響，乃該貝祖詒等竟以全部出售金塊，交由同豐餘負責分配與大豐恒，宏豐永，生源永，久成永，楊慶和發記，裕發永祥和等金號，訂立合同，以九九純金成色，分化金條，分發各金號銀樓，央行給與同豐餘以每十兩三分之火耗（見詹蓮生訊問筆錄），是央行全部售金之熔化數量，已使同豐餘洞悉。又據詹蓮生及太康潤，方九霞昌記，楊慶和發記，負責人供述（見訊問筆錄），央行所有指定五家行號配售之黃金，均須經同豐餘主持人詹連生蓋章，方能領取，是又以央行之售出黄金總數量，使詹蓮生全部洞悉，同豐餘為金業交易之最大行號，詹蓮生更為金業投機交易之鉅子，自不難據此總數，以推悉央行存金之多寡，而伺機與黄金政策作投機之決鬥，以獲取鉅利，該祖等貝詒，若非有意洩露此項機密，儘可將金磚交由中央造幣廠自行熔化，即以造幣廠設備不全，須求之金號銀樓，亦應分別委託，不必由同豐餘一家總攬其事，並由詹蓮生一人負責蓋章一事，苟五家指定負黄金配售工作之行號（同豐餘·太康潤·大豐恒·方九霞昌記。楊慶和發記）確為央行自行以一定標準指定者，則自可各自向央行辦理領取金條手續，何必更由詹蓮生一人獨任其事，其中情弊，已灼然可見矣</p>
<p>實爲官商勾結</p>
<p>（二）央行出售黄金，係指定上述五家行號負責，每日金價之決定，亦係以五家與央行之對講電話報吿為準，五家之責任，自甚重大，而央行指定五家負責配售黄金工作之行號，均係由貝祖詒·林鳳苞·楊安仁三人同意決定，漫無標準（詳金潮監查報吿書），已屬不當，益以此五家均係由詹蓮生一人介紹（見訊問筆錄），則顯然央行出售黃金事宜，在市塲方面，故任詹蓮生一人把持操縱，謂為官商勾結，實非過分。</p>
<p>擅定暗售方略</p>
<p>（三）央行每日出售之黄金，除明配係由金業銀樓兩公會根據各會員之申請配發外，其暗售金條，中央銀行分配與五家，復一任其自由處分不惟其價格之決定，以五家均係與詹蓮生沆議一氣，自易受其操縱，且以國家有限之黄金，專供金業投機之無窮慾壑，黄金存數日少，法幣發行日多，央行將有捉襟見肘反受其困之日，自屬顯然，而此暗售方略，旣非政府所決定，當為貝林楊三人擅定之辦怯。</p>
<p>縱使部屬嫌疑</p>
<p>（四）查閱五家配售黃金行號之出售金條帳目，列有中央銀行同人購買之黄金數十筆，討有百餘條，甚至管理黄金庫存之　理王松濤，亦購進金條，該貝祖詒等漫不加以約束，實有縱使部　染指黃金投機買賣之嫌疑。</p>
<p>嚴懲以肅綱紀</p>
<p>（五）央行黄金買賣情形，自以貝祖詒等知之最深，在本年一月初以來，金價逐步上升黄金政策已不能支持之先，該貝祖詒等自應據實呈報，另籌善法，乃直延至二月八日，貝祖詒始晋京請示，二月九日晚車返滬，翌晨突然宣佈黄金停止配售，致金價暴漲，無法收拾，中央不得不於十六日公佈經濟緊急措施辦法。據貝祖詒等稱：此項突停配售，係奉主席諭令，惟據委員等調查結果，主席並無此項指示，由此可知該貝祖詒等，於措置乖方之餘，竟以責任諉之最高當局，實屬不法已極。根據上列事實，中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，襄理王松濤等，顯為違法凟職，不予嚴懲，不足以肅綱紀，儆官邪，謹依法提案彈劾，即請移付懲戒。</p>
<p>審查報告</p>
<p>為審查報告事：奉交何委員漢文等彈劾中央銀行總裁貝祖詒等違法瀆職一案，經委員等會同審查，僉以央行出售黃金，藉以穩定物價事情何等重大，該行重要負責人員，不於事前作嚴密之規定，致予奸商以牟利機會，已屬有乖職守，至以全部分配之責，委託投機商人詹　生一人辦，並以在職務上應守之機密，洩露於承辦人，其中顯有情弊，其准該行職員從中染指，漫不加查，尤有縱容之　，迨至無法收拾，又稱奉主席諭令突停配售，又屬不法，應請將該中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，襄理王松濤，一併移付懲戒，以為違法凟職者戒。</p>

<h3>本市記者發表宣言反對國際干涉中國</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕上海市新聞記者，為反對國際干涉，昨特發表宣言稱；</p>
<p>莫斯科會議的第一天，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫竟提出要求將中國問題列入議程之內，他想策動美英蘇三國共同干涉中國。</p>
<p>此種不友好的能度，不僅是對於全中國民族不可容忍的侮辱，而且是對一般國際公法，特別是對聯合國憲章的公開挑釁。</p>
<p>在中蘇條約簽訂以來，蘇聯一貫的打擊中國，中國人民睦鄰的精神，中國政府和善的能度，並未能改變蘇聯反對中國的成見。</p>
<p>在一九四五年第一次倫敦外長會議的時候，蘇聯即曾排斥中國參加對義羅匈保等和的的起草，其後第二次第三次第四次的外長會議，多因蘇聯的拒絕，中國根本不能預會，而第二次的莫斯科外長會議，更由於蘇聯的策動，三國外長在宣言中，將中國與歐洲戰敗附庸國家置於同列，蘇聯有意打擊中國地位，為其日後策動干涉中國的伏筆，在此次四外長會議之前，蘇聯又反對中國參加會議，用意即在便於策動干涉，此次會議，本以討論對德奧和約為主中國非戰敗國，莫洛托夫竟在第一天公然要求討論中國問題，這可見蘇聯對於中國原抱有强權的偏見，至於其所謂中國內政云云，不過是强權政洽陳舊的藉口。</p>
<p>我們必須向全世界各國政府聲明，中國在國際反侵略一戰爭中，血戰八年之久，對於聯合國的勝利，中國軍民作了最壯烈的犧牲，中國有功於世界，無負於聯合國，我們決不承認聯合國中之一國或數國有干涉中國內政的權利，所謂國際干涉，是强權政治不可分離的一部分，這在今天　不容其復活，來威脅人類的文明與生存。</p>
<p>我們要求政府以堅決的態度，反對任何國際會議對於中國問題的任何討諭，現在蘇美英三國外長有在會外討論之說，就是這種非正式的討論，中國亦不能容忍，政府斷不可派代表參加、也斷不可不堅持反對到底的立塲。</p>
<p>我們要求政府宣佈中蘇條約以來蘇聯在東北一切行為的全部事實，並公吿於世界，政府過去對於這種事實，發表得太少，應該使國人和世界完全了解全部事實，知道今日要來干涉中國的人，其行為是如何有背於國際的道德。</p>
<p>政府有維護國家獨立與尊嚴的責任，如能堅定這一立塲，我們深信全國人民必一致作最大的支持，否則全國人民一定不能容忍政府的懦怯。</p>
<p>我們都是從事新聞事業的人，向來主張國際和平與合作，現在蘇聯的對華態度，已使任何對蘇聯懷抱好感的人，不能不深致憤慨，無論為了國際正義，為了國家尊嚴，我們必須喚起全國人民超越黨派的私見，一致以嚴正的民族立塲反對干涉中國的策動，我們並且切望全世界主張和平與正義的人士，注意莫洛托夫所提倡的于涉主義，不僅是對中國的侮辱，也是對世界和平的威脅。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>對於三中全會的期望</h3>
<p>中國國民黨第六屆三中全會，今天在首都隆重開幕了。這一次的全會，是國民黨最高執行機關在還政於民實施憲政前夕的最後一决會議，國民黨本身的動向以及今後政治的演進，均將視這一次全會開會的結果而定，故這次全會的意義，原已異乎尋常，而又適在內外大局動盪震撼的今日舉行，更値得全國人民的萬分重視了。</p>
<p>國民黨之在中國，不僅有悠久的歷史，而且在改造中國的歷史上，有其不可磨滅的功績；在過去，自興中會同盟會而還，中國國民黨站在國父革命旗幟之下，領導全國被壓迫的人民，推對滿淸，締造民國；打倒袁世凱，再迭共和；其後又能掃除軍閥，完成統一。直至最近暴日侵凌，中國國民黨又在蔣主席的領導之下，從事聖戰，堅苦卓絕，八年如一日，終於獲得光榮的勝利，而將百年恥辱所積成的不平等條約，一筆勾消；這些都是國民黨對於國家民族的功勞，為任何人所不能否認的！為任何人所不能一筆抹殺的！</p>
<p>但是在抗戰勝利之後，因為共產黨的問題，接踵而起，勝利之果，即開始腐爛，致使光榮變為恥辱，這便是改造中國史上的一大悲劇。和平談判了一年有餘，終因共產黨的執迷不悟，企圖以武力奪取政權，以致全面決裂，於是烽火蔓延，蘇北，魯南，魯中，魯東，魯西，熱北，陜北，以及東北，盡成為殺人盈野血流成渠的戰塲；在戰區的人民直接受砲火的摧毀，大半流離失所，生靈塗炭；就是不在戰區的人民，也間接受其影響，交通阻塞貨物不能暢其流，生產停頓供不應求，於是百物飛漲，社會騷動，民不聊生。同時政府為應付共產黨的攻勢起見，又不得不保持相當的軍隊，於是軍費支出浩大，通貨膨脹無法遏止，乃造成目前的嚴重局面·使黨內黨外的人士，大家都覺得憂愁焦慮，沉悶抑鬰，消極悲觀，甚至有一部份人，怨天尤人，而將造成目前局勢的責任，諉諸於國民黨。</p>
<p>我們平心而論，國民黨在朝執政達二十年之久，在政治上旣未能將政風改革一新，在經濟上又未能改善民生，以致造成目前的嚴重局勢，國民黨實在不能不反躬自省！痛下決心，澈底改革傳統的制度與作風，替中國政治開一條新的道路，替中國　政打好一個鞏固的基礎。這是國民黨對國對民應盡的責任。目下正在實施　政的過渡時代，只要國民黨有決心有毅力，不難與民更始。惟一切革新大計，均將取決於今天開幕的三中全會。我們除了祝望其成功而外，我們並願乘這個機會，敬吿中國國民黨幾句話。</p>
<p>第一中國國民黨黨員均應振奮革命精神，唯有革命精神振奮飽滿的人，才有大無畏的氣魄，才能樂觀前進，才能克服當前的在何困難，以國民黨本身而論，有博大精深合乎潮流的主義，並有偉大卓越的領袖，只要黨員人人均有革命精神，即使至實施憲政之後黨派林立，而國民黨仍不失為負有和平建國的重任的第一大黨。現在我們常常到有人攻　國民黨為反動，不問其理由是否充分，我們終覺得國民黨黨人，應該引以為恥深切反省，問問自己的革命精神是否振奮飽滿？再間問自己的思想行為是否有落伍退步的地方？有則改之，無則勉之。唯有這樣，國民黨始能保持過去的朝氣。這次全會將討論及黨務改革方案，全國黨員總檢查，我們認為是不可不實行的；一方面可以淘汰對黨無堅强信仰的卑劣　化份子，另一方面則可以集合眞正忠於黨忠於主義的優秀份十，共同負起和平建國的大任。</p>
<p>第二國民黨在此實施憲政的過渡時代，應該加倍努力，以完成實施憲政的一切必要的準備工作。替中國的政治開出一條新的道路來。因為我們老百姓只希望中國眞正成為一個民主的新中國，而對於國民黨，只要國民黨本身眞正是一個民主集權的大政黨，在還政於民之後，我們還希望它再能負起和平建國的大任。其實中國與國民黨，在中國過去的歷史上，固然分不開，就是到了今後，也一時不容易分得開的。所以國民黨努力準備實施憲政的工作，固然是為了中華民國，但是也是為了國民黨的本身。</p>
<p>第三改組政府在這次全會內必須全部確定，我們老百姓渴望政府改組，提高行政效率，肅淸貪官汚吏，為時已久，但是遲遲復　遲，一直到今日，政府還沒有實現，實在太令人失望了。我們在上面已經說過？國人對於國內政局最大的期望，就是實施　政的準備工作，立即展開，俾為中國　政樹立一個良好的規模，否則時不我留，轉瞬之間，開始行憲之期就要來到，事前如沒有充份的準備，怎能希望憲政開始實行後即能面目一新呢？</p>
<p>最後，我們還要指出，民生的必須安定，否則一切都無從談起；在此過渡時期內，即使政府改組，擴大基礎，容納各黨派參加在內，但是政府仍以國民黨為主體，所有一切內政外交以及金融財政的措施，還要國民黨向人民負責。目下民生痛苦，不堪言狀，國民黨向能處處爲人民着想，時時爲國家打算，凡有利於人民有益於國家的，均應不辭任何艱難，埋頭去幹。實行平均地權與節制資木的具體辦法以實現民生主義的理想，切不可再放任因循，坐視物價　漲，以致社會騷動民不聊生。三中全會討論對於經濟改革方案時，一定要拿出實行民生主義的具體辦法出來。</p>

<h3>美參院委會通過保留預備兵役額　兩院昨辯論外交新政策　援助希土方案本月底前應有所決定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕美參院兵役委員會，「由於世界形勢危殆」，在國會能制定普遍軍役以案以前，今日突以出乎意外之舉動，通過保留所有在各地方徵兵局預備役登記名額。該委會對於三月三十一日滿期之抽調兵役法延長，並無行動，惟該會在陸長柏德遜於末次會議時突然出席該會，表示意見稱，由於美國干涉希土事件，各地方徽兵局預備役登記名錄應暫時保留，以便在必要時即可迅速動員後，即一致通過將兵役法暫維現狀。</p>
<p>同時陸海及國務三部之最高級官吏皆在努力催促國會，對杜魯門總統之「共產主義檢疫」計劃迅速通過。渠等秘密報吿參院外委會，關於速予希土經濟及軍事援助計劃，現距英國停止對希援助之期祗有十八日，華府行政當局對議會作戰之積極準備，由杜魯門昨日之公開聲明而更加速者，決不再坐失時機，據聞陸長柏德遜·海長福萊斯特及代理國務卿艾克遜，曾將行政當局如何運用，何時運用，以及用於何處之國會批准基金，阻止共黨在近東可怖之擴張之細節呈諸國會。</p>
<p>經過議會一日之開會，參院外委會之主席范登堡預料，國會將完全支持杜魯門之反共計劃。惟渠警吿稱：議會並非盲目追隨於行政當局之後，而將要求近東方面危機之各項重要情報。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十三日電〕頃悉：衆院外委會主席，即共和黨議員伊頓，定明日在衆院提出討論總統貸款希土兩國之建議。據伊頓本日向報界談稱：衆院外委會定明日舉行秘密會議，討論整個國際局勢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕參院共和黨領袖今日準備對杜魯門總統援助希臘土耳其案迅速進行，俾在本月卅一日英軍撤退以前有所決定。據共和黨政策委員會主席參議員塔虎脫稱：三月卅一日為一重要日斯。參院外委會主席范登堡亦稱，是日為該會聽取意見之最後限期。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十三日電〕據國務院專家稱：美國對土貸款一億五千萬元中，大部份將用以增强土國之軍事組織，以防任何可能的攻擊。對希貸款二億五千萬元中，至少當有半數將用作訓練並配備希陸軍十萬名之用，以防止任何事件。專家並謂在希臘之美國顧問將使希政府從事重大的經濟改革。</p>
<h3>美外交新動向旨在防止戰爭</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十三日電〕美國外交政策之新發展並非實彈戰爭之謂。其本意仍在進行十餘年前西方各國所未能進行之事，即防止戰爭是也。另一方面，此乃門羅主張之伸長，自西半球廣展至任何處之自由人民。杜魯門總統實際聲明，美國過去作戰目的，不欲使極權主義巷換另一極權主義。美國意欲伸展保護的軍隊於海外，反對此種替換，並樹立前哨站，反對其侵入美國讓為屬於本身之世界一部份。今後多年內或將糾紛迭出，但此種政策之最迫切的效果，乃在减低實際戰爭的可能性云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統援助自由民族之政策倘若推廣，則朝鮮與匈牙利將在候補名單上列於前位。政府若干部官員已在草擬方案，援助該兩國，各該國之困境，至少一部份為蘇聯勢力壓迫之結果，情形興希臘及土耳其相同。衡諸勝利日以來之美國對外援助，可知杜魯門向國會所揭示之政策如推行至全世界，則日後或將包括中國與義大利在內。但民主陣綫其他國家最後能否要求美國援助，尙待分　。</p>
<h3>參院展開外交辯論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕參院今夜辯論外交甚為激烈，共和黨參議員白樂克斯稱：美國曾於戰時以數十億美元之軍備租借蘇聯，今則必須「與之作戰」。杜魯門總統昨要求以四億美元之款項接濟希　與土耳其，以阻止蘇驕勢力之擴展，吾人當初悔未聽任德軍併呑蘇聯。吾人當時不助蘇聯，則今日即無世界共產主義之威脅。吾人茲須從新做起。第一步派遣軍事顧問　，第二步即為派遣軍隊及戰車，第三步即為戰爭矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕共和黨參議員白魯斯　對總統演詞評稱：「余願政府說明中國共產黨與希臘共黨有何區別。」衆議員奧康斯　稱：「吾人欲制止共產主義，何不首先制止國內共產主義？何不制止南美之共產主義？何不協助西班牙逐出其共黨？制止以上各地之共產主義皆有機會，逐出希臘之共黨則不能。」</p>
<h3>肅清德境納粹問題　四外長發生激辯　蘇同意小國參加討論德和約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：四國外次與軍事專家，今晨十一時恢復對德奧和的之預備工作。又四强外長於下午四時（莫斯科時間）舉行第五次會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十三日電〕四國外决討論對奧和的，已同意今後奧地利軍官凡曾在希特勒軍隊中服務者，不得位居上校以上之階級。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十四日廣播：蘇聯在原則上已同意准許小盟國參加對德和的之商討。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十三日電〕四國外長今日舉行第四次會議，由英外相貝文主席，美國務卿馬歇爾提出一項建議，要求盟國對肅淸德境納粹份子一事，應採取一致政策，並謂，美國今獲悉蘇聯對於參加德國共產主義社會統一黨之納粹份子，並不加以淸查。美政府對於利用肅淸納粹份子作為政治工具，以贊助任何德國政黨者，均所反對。英外相貝文亦響應馬歇爾立塲即盟國必須統一肅淸納粹之政策。馬鄉幷指出美佔領區內之納粹份子不得參加政黨活動，而蘇聯佔領區之活躍納粹份子，則有參加社會統一黨之事件。馬歇爾旋即要求應訓令柏林盟國管制會，飭德國當局統一法令，對德國人民予以「平等與公平」之保證。最後莫洛托夫興員文對此皆表示同意，惟莫洛托夫曾答稱，余並不知有納粹份子應徵加入社會統一黨之事，但蘇聯佔領區已肅淸卅九萬另四百七十入人，而其他佔領區內之肅淸工作，則極為惡劣云。莫洛托夫　在會中要求在德國組織全面性之工會，不分佔領區界限，幷要求西部佔領區亦實行蘇佔領區所已推行之土地改革方案。錢謂統一佔領區政府之後，則討論德國政府之將來組織時，可避免種　辯論，例如美佔領區內今所組織之政府乃　聯邦性質，而蘇羈佔領區則為中央集權政府。據此問所獲印象，馬歇爾與貝文欲將一般原則提出討論，均未成功。明日第五次會議仍將討論肅淸納粹問題。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾讚揚杜魯門演說</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：邱吉爾在保守黨會議中發表演說，批評杜魯門總統之新外交政策稱：「在美國對維持世界和平自由所採取之各項步驟中，就余所知未有如此次之堅強有力而給予更多之機會者。美國苟於上次大戰前採取此步驟，當可阻止其發生，苟於第一次大戰後採取此步驟，則更可制止之。若在一九一四年以前採取此步驟，則世界和平必能維持不墜，而吾人咸得生活於更幸福之世界矣。余確信吾國輿論對於美國之此種偉大決策，必表示歡迎，此乃吾人應盡之義務也。余敢謂吾人之政策，即如美國之對蘇友好政策，惟此乃強硬之友好政策，而非軟弱之綏靖政策也」云。</p>

<h3>金潮要犯詹蓮生解法院略訊收押　林楊兩人在監視下照常辦公</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行前業務局長林鳳苞，前副局長楊安仁，勾結金號業同業公會理事長詹蓮生，利用職權，於明配暗售黃金之時，操縱抬價，造成此次金潮，經經濟監察團查獲呈報最高當局，日前淞滬警備司令部奉蔣主席侍宙第六〇四二六號代電，將林鳳苞。楊安仁·詹蓮生拘押偵查，認為被吿等有懲治食汚條例第二條第六款，第三條第六款之罪嫌，除林。楊兩被吿於前晚准予交保，詹蓮生已於昨日下午五時十分，以貪汚共犯解地方法院，於五時卅分由地院在家焯推事開庭訊問。據詹供稱：今年六十歲，蘇州人，住北京路六六八弄二十五號，任同豐餘金號經理，及本市金號業公會理事長。在推事訊畢即諭收押。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕敵僞時期上海金融界巨子唐壽民，被控曾任「商梳會」理事長等僞職漢奸嫌疑一案，經高院於去年五月三十日判處無期徒刑，唐不服上訴最高法院，去年九月二十一日經最高法院覆判發還更審，該案昨日下午在高院重開調查庭訊問。唐衣深藍色綢面絲棉袍，面色　腴，態度從容，辯稱：戰前即任交通銀行總經理，二十六年抗戰發生，隨政府到漢口，嗣奉命赴香港，整理交通銀行業務。香港淪陷後，擬由九龍逃回重慶，不幸被敵憲兵拘捕，押解來滬，汪精衛要我做實業部長經我拒絕，因我原係在交通銀行做事，為保全該行財產計，遂就任交通銀行董事長職。勝利後交通銀行現金悉數移交，金條一根未動，有交通銀行證明書足資證明。僞商業統制委員會是周佛海，梅思平召集上海各界代表茶會，即席發表「商統會」組織，並推選我為理事長，在當時情勢下推辭實不可能。在任偽職期間，經偽府委託收買紗布十二萬七千餘件，一部份曾配給與上海市民，無論男女老幼，每人一丈五尺，其餘均存於會庫內，勝利後均交出。此外曾供給中央經濟情報，由袁良轉發，又現任天津市副市長張子奇，軍統局職員戴覺生，均可證明。對曾任僞中儲行參事，僞全國經濟委員會委員，則辯稱均係空頭名義，從未到過。　由律師路式導，江容起立辯護，庭諭尙需調查，改期再訊。</p>

<h3>長春北青籃球隊征天津旗開得勝　首戰擊敗中紡一隊</h3>
<p>〔本報天津航訊〕長春北靑籃球隊抵津後，九日開始與津隊會師，下午三時半音戰中紡一隊於耀華體育館，由李友珍。姚恩漢分任裁判，觀衆頗踴躍，松北難民於第一日即獲得九十餘萬元之救濟金。如北平隊來津之議可實現，收穫當益為可觀，故北靑隊可謂不虛此行。</p>
<p>中紡佔先</p>
<p>銀笛一聲後，各顯身手，北青健兒多身材高大，氣力充沛，惟以人地生疏，陣容稍失凌亂，致為中一所乘。中紡隊擁有國手李紹唐及李耀會。龐雁林等，士氣甚盛，酣戰中先聲奪人，得分領先。北靑不甘示弱，馬慶普亦屢投中的，奈因軍心慌亂，先後十次罰球機會，中一僅得其二，致前半局以十六比廿二失敗。</p>
<p>北青居上</p>
<p>易陣後，北靑改變戰略，頗見起色。中紡攻守　宜，始終以一球居先，北膏雖一度以卅三分造成平勢，但後防時為人乘虛而入，旋又落後。中紡隊以獲勝心切，時有犯規，李紹唐竟被罰出塲。至此蜀中無將，大勢已去，於最後六分鐘，北靑長趨直入，田福海·徐永久得分激增。中紡雖有龐李等力挽狂瀾，奈時間已至，後半終以廿一比卅二懷恨息兵，總結果四十八比四十三，北靑以五分佔先。十日晚第二戰對津電仍在耀華舉行。</p>

<p>經濟緊急措施辦法頒佈後，國家行局放款方針，經　蔣主席召集四聯總處理事會議，制定配合方案，是項方案，現經四聯總處通飭全國各地國家行局遵照辦理　方案內容以配合經濟緊急措施規定，限價供應民生日用必需品，（一）糧食，（二）紗布，（三）燃料，（四）食鹽，（五）食油，（六）食糖之金融調劑爲主旨，舉凡上述各品之生產，購運，均有詳細規定。整個目標在達到生產增加，盈虛調劑，物價平抑，民生安定，並對供應諸品之生產器材原料外匯，以及中央銀行各行局曁省市銀行之資金調度，亦均列入。茲探誌方案內容如下：（甲）對有關供應物品之生產事業，應優先予以協助；（乙）運用各行局現有分支機稱，協助採購供應物品，並協助暢通運輸，疏導來源。（丙）優先核給機件，原料，及其他便利。（丁）調度貸款資金。</p>

<h3>銀樓業代表再晋京請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海銀樓業公會及全國各地銀樓業代表，以各會員停業將近一月，「改行」與解散者已達十餘家之多，政府對於修正飾金辦法，迄未公佈，決於明日再度晋京，向三中全會及行政院請願。此次該業晋京請願之各地代表，人數雖已减少，單位却已增多，近來各地抵滬代表，日有增加。據姚聯芳吿記者稱：俟銀樓業復業，或將組織全國銀樓業公會聯合會，渠復稱：政府如不配售黃金，至少允許可以自由收兌買賣，方可繼續營業。</p>
<h3>外股逐步盤低</h3>
<p>外股昨繼續下游，證券帮心理怯軟，買戶倍形寥落。怡紗晨開一九六〇〇元，自一九七〇〇元後，逐步盤低至一八四〇〇元。午收稍穩，午後徘徊而已，無甚特色。結果較前收計英聯怡紗紙業怡睥跌半成强，航業跌一成外，餘均小挫。</p>
<h3>粳米中下略升　桶生油回漲萬元</h3>
<p>昨日米市南北共到一萬五千石左右。粳米中下略升千元，高貨平定，惟河存尙豐，收盤轉　，形勢欲漲無力。秈米則產區高昂，人心堅挺，價升千元。白元陰元呆滯不振。麵粉到貨踵接，去胃溥閒，回挫千元。麩皮交易寥落，仍看疲勢。豆餅客消不動，早緊午淡，結果平平。</p>
<p>油市生油店胃尙殷，桶生油回漲萬元，　生油亦加三四千元，惟豆油因靑島漢口天津均有到貨，市氣少神，菜油及淸油仍無榮辱。</p>
<p>豆趨疲，缸豆軋小千元，赤豆亦低千元。芝蔴挺秀，生仁外埠去化冷懈，本街去化平常，步削三五千元。苞米北洋納胃甚微，提高殺决，紅糧節節下降，再跌二三千元。蠶豆盤旋之局，黃豆去路不爽，萎魔杖之勢。</p>
<h3>謠傳美滙將改動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市塲盛傳中央銀行對美電匯率，將改掛八千元，一說爲一萬元。流言旣起，華股市價首吿挫落。其他一般物價，亦莫不均趨下游。　市塲一般信念，認爲央行此次人事更動，爲配合政府經濟新方案計，施策必有改進，而一說又傳將收回鉅額法幣，不再發行，故人心對法幣或抱樂觀。記者旋以改變匯　掛牌之事，詢諸央行外匯審核處某負責人。渠稱：迄未聞及此事，一切須候張總　返行後，始有端倪。</p>
<p>又據某觀察家談稱：我國對美匯率，改訂不久。以目前我國通貨情狀言，似應先求其長時期穩定於某一水準，已屬理想。如一再改訂，無論放長收縮、均非所宜。故渠信政府不致隨意　動　率云。</p>
<h3>國營事業發歸民營　明日開會商討</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國營事業發歸民營之計劃委員會，前曾一度召開會議。後以中樞改組關係，延冗未再召開會議。茲悉：行政院副院長翁文灝，已定十六日在本市再度召開該項會議。屆時對發歸民營計劃，將作進一步之商討，俾便決定實施對策云。</p>
<h3>華股賣方聲勢較盛次熱雜牌先後跌停</h3>
<p>華股昨繼續下游，惟因銀根仍鬆，中途頗多盤旋，大戶多空均在自動减少存額，成交已見滅少，次熱及雜牌頗多跌至停限。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>平穩，遞永紗開後一九八號一八五號八三號六八號一九九號一二九號二二六號均進曾回升至三二〇〇元。一八〇號一五五號七六號二三五號三二號一七九號四七號二二四號二號一五六號力加供給，遞永紗曾迫低至三〇〇〇元。九七號一七九號二三五號趁低補進升爲三〇八〇元。二號一七一號一五六號一九七號八五號一四號二〇七號一五二號一五四號一六號二〇五號連袂了結，統益美亞大通永公水泥榮豐紛紛跌至停限，乃破三〇〇〇元大關，遞永紗迫低至二八五〇元。一八〇號二三一號一四號一七七號一二號等有補，午收站二九〇〇元外。結果較前收計永紗中法各跌半成，信和美亞新光新華勤興景福各跌一成迄一成半，華豐降半成弱，遞交計永紗華豐新光各跌半成，信和美亞跌一成，冷股榮豐永公新亞中紡水泥統益大通商務均告迫停，惟若干種跌停後有回，火柴景綸五和麗安內衣均迫近跌停</p>

<h3>細布喊價步昂</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以紡建公司供售細布不多，而染廠吸胃不斷，致現貨籌碼枯竭，塲中人心向榮，開價步昂。十二磅龍頭細布價做高至十六萬元，較上日升一千五百元，藍鷄十四萬六千元，升二千元。振中十三萬五千元，上漲五千元，其他各牌亦均升一二千元不一。至元色布　嘰，以天時將轉和緩，本　門莊零星　化頗強，做價更形俏俐，客路天津帮大量採辦。四君子金印　　，初開爲十四萬九千五百元，步高至十五萬二千元，軋升四千元。四〇五羊細斜十三萬七千五百元，軋升七千五百元，其餘各貨亦形堅穩云。</p>

<h3>祁紅市況帶軟</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，賣戶對於專供內銷之紅緣茶，喊價雖一度曾見遞增，惟終因去化微末，市氣卒猶無力晋升，復呈徘徊狀態。洋莊交易，英商一味力抑之祁鬥紅茶，則續有做開，良以一般急求頭寸用者，依舊吐售也。價格方面雖未連跌，然情况咸帶軟化。據買戶意思，如貨主再肯讓步，則更有悅胃吸收。他若各式緣茶，陳久多年之次貨，仍難脫手。而卅四年及卅五年度之花色，問津者則絡繹不絕。惜吐納商談之結果，缺乏順利，過程逐難轉絢爛局面，形勢堅定如故。</p>

<p>昨日紗市續趨榮欣，因津帮仍有納胃，同行乘勢買吸，致各支紗又升十萬，四十支單紗仍爲織廠所需求，與四十二支雙股綫同漲廿五萬。其餘各支價格雖隨跟上十萬，然徒有喊價，買客仍極缺乏，脚地殊　不穩。</p>

<h3>論「魔」與「道」</h3>
<p>— 閣哲吾</p>
<p>兼談大劈棺·西遊記·潘金蓮之類</p>
<p>「道高一尺，魔高一丈」，這是中國正統思想的理論定則。因此，所謂「道」者，吾人固知其「克己復禮」，却是「禁慾主義」的成果！這成果與「人性」的本色，自然是相反之「道」！因爲道也者，規矩方圓，人爲的力量之表現與軌範，並非自由慾求之所之，在政治上可以成爲正論，然而在文藝表現上却是個值得反抗的題材！文藝表現的兩大中心，色與食耳！聖人亦說：「食色性也」。可見文藝的最高表現，不外是性愛與面包的問題！</p>
<p>性愛既是人性的一面，文藝上表現常脫不了這範疇。而以所望「道」也者與「人性」的糾葛鬥爭爲主題的作品，歷來古今中外也有不少的發現！</p>
<p>比如最近我看了我幼年曾看過的「大劈棺」，正統論者謂爲黃色文化，但是我仔細考察的結果，那寫劇的題旨也不過是「道」與「魔」的主題另一種的表現而已！比如莊周設計試婦，這是「道」的立足點在作祟，而當莊周告以「搧墳」之事，其妻罵人無恥，并謂自己將來絕不出此，此又是「道」的立足點！那是人爲社會的規範，不是人性本身的慾求！所以后來莊周變爲公子來弔，倘非漂亮青年色相誘惑，來個麻子，瞎子，亦未見即動婦人愛好之心！而公子要吃「生人腦子」此種不近情理之欲求，婦人初亦未見忍於下手，然以公子之呼聲魔力，遂引起不顧一切之行動，此在「性變態心裏」解釋下是可能的，這是「魔」力壓倒「道」行的表現！編此劇者固有寫「婦人淫心之試探」之意，然未嘗沒有反抗所謂「守寡」片面貞節之思想存乎其間，所惜者寫得太窮兇極惡一點而已！</p>
<p>昔者，歐陽予倘先生寫了「潘金蓮」翻了舊案他認爲潘之愛西門慶，乃在愛不到武松之變態結果，今日醉麗君在「武松」一劇中所用結尾大段道白，即是當年話劇「潘金蓮」的主要台詞。那當時洪深先生即以變態心理學的理論評衡過，罂爲歐陽先生「大胆」之作，事實上在文學上所謂惡魔派的作品，這類人性的本色之演染所在皆是！「莎樂美」爲要吻聖者不可得而結果要到聖者的「頭」，這也是魔輿道的鬥爭，也是性變態心理的满足！</p>
<p>同様地，「西遊記」中唐僧肉，個個妖怪想吃！這也是聖者舆妖魔的鬥法，所不同者，每次皆是唐僧遇難，忠貞自守，道心不動，終於得救而已！係這種「空」輿「色」的鬥法主题，中國的「白蛇傳」也是這一流的產物！在日本有個「強盜」劇本，述一個小偷被一個女人欺騙，終於被捕的故事，也有同樣以「魔」服「誠」的意味！</p>
<p>至於另一個劇本呌「空」輿「色」的，內容寫一個「高僧」，廿年的道行修錬之後，在旅行途中，重遇他那廿年的情婦，極力克己自守，然而終於被那女人灌得泥醉，廿年的道行，一且全抛！這也是寫魔力壓過道行的產物！</p>
<p>總之，魔與道之鬥爭，在文學上常成爲一大主題，至於寫道勝還是魔勝，那是各有看法！不過我以爲寫性愛的直率文學，並無罪過，不過渲染過火，台上宣淫，當亦爲「道」所不許，那却也是「人性」向下的路子。流於消沉，麻木之河，當非人類前途所需，大概「黃色」的文化之所謂「黃」，即指此意而言；然而就文藝言文藝，自有其另一「道德觀」固不必以平凡的俗論衡量可耳！</p>
<h3>兩全其美</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>孟子說：「魚，我所欲也，熊掌亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼」兩全其美，實在是很困難的事。</p>
<p>既要文章寫得好，又要文章受人歡迎，恐怕也就等於與熊掌二者不可得兼。因爲誰都是一定能夠明白：好文章未必受人歡迎，受人歡迎的未必是好文章；雖然好文章也會受人歡迎，受人歡迎的也會有好文章，恐怕這到底還是少數的例外。第一，文章的好不好，有什麼絕對的，客觀的標準呢？沒有。那末好文章的本身就沒有可靠的根據了。第二，在「文以人重」的今日，好文章尤其沒有準則，往往著名文人所寫的，即使是不成文的帳目，也當作傑作，而無名之輩的精心傑作，却總難得有發表的機會，連最起碼的幸運都沒有。因此，所謂好文章，也許正是壞文章！文章的受人歡迎與否，決不在其好壞。文章得好壞與受人歡迎與否，完全是二事，正與魚是魚，熊掌是熊掌一樣。</p>
<p>如果懂得這一點，文章不能兩全其美，一定可以省去許多麻煩，誰都可以認定了目標幹去，而得如願以償。譬如，你只要文章好，受人歡迎與否，絕對不在你的意中，那你寫作時，一定會本着良知良能，寫成你以爲最好的文章，不論在內容上或外表上，也將爲少數真有眼光而識貨的人所賞識。如果你只要受人歡迎，那末，老實告訴你，你簡直用不着顧慮到文章的好不好，更不必走吃力不討好的迂路一定要文章好，只要想法引起讀者的注意，博得讀者的歡心，你就可以成功。這樣，各得其所：要文章好的，果然文章好了，要人歡迎的果然有人歡迎了，恐怕倒是真正的一種兩全其美。</p>
<p>分之爲兩的，才有兩全其美可說，合之爲一的，兼起來的，就無兩全其美可期。這是我們應該認識清楚的。</p>
<p>可惜現在有許多不明白這個道理，還不拼命想兼兩美於一身，却弄得「駝子跌跟斗，兩頭不着實」更生出許多煩惱來。例如：自以爲自己的文章是好的，起初想一定受人歡迎，等到結果並不如此，就竭力研究其原因，研究的結果，必然只有二條路：一，改弦易轍，不在忠於文章的本身，而惟求人的歡迎，因爲並不慣於如此受人的歡迎歡迎不可得，自己的文章却就此壞了；二，不免怨天尤人，以爲文章惜命，毫無生路。至於本來受人歡迎的文章，忽然也想力爭上游，寫的真正好些，其結果也將失去歡迎，而婢學夫人，終於是個四不像，一無是處，心裏的懊惱，當然就難免了。</p>
<p>可惜現在還有許多人不明白這個道理，又在拼命瞎捧人家：看見別人的好文章，就說，一定可以洛陽紙貴，大受歡迎。聽了這話的作者，起初受寵若驚，喜不自勝，日子稍久，除非他已悟出不能兼美的道理，否則他不是改變宗旨，與世浮沈，就只好牢騷滿腹，憂傷滿面，成爲一個失望的愁人。或者看見某人的文章受人歡迎，就說，到底是傑作，所以會有這樣的成績，却不料你在暗地劃下了一條界線，將那個作者推出了文學的天國，使他永遠不得回來。老實說，我就不肯這樣瞎捧人，騙人，我要說：你的文章是好的，但未必會受人歡迎；或說：你的受人歡迎是事實，但你的文章未必是好的。總之，你不能兩全其美。</p>
<p>我這樣說，並非過激之談，故意說說反話，唱唱高調，世事不能兩全其美的正多着呢，何止文章，更何止魚與熊掌！</p>
<p>聖經上說：「財主的人要想進天國正如駱駝穿過針的眼」。也是這個道理。否則一手如意，一手算盤，有槍花的人都可以大得其法，名利雙收，而安分守己，並且確實學有專長的，豈不要一概活活氣死！……</p>
<p>話說野了，還是回到文章上來。你總先應該認識不能夠兩全其美的道理，然後你再決定，二者不可得兼時，你到底走那一條路！你決定了，你就勇猛精進地幹下去，不要懊惱，我祝願你的成功！</p>
<h3>山水</h3>
<p>— 顧飛</p>
<h3>讀「懷孫伏老」</h3>
<p>— 宣建人</p>
<p>讀三月一日春秋魯莽先生的大作「懷孫伏老」一文，正是我懷念孫伏老的時候，我是時常懷念起這位慈祥的老人。伏老的精神，仍和二十來歲的青年一樣，沒有絲毫的「老氣」，不像現時那些青年作家以老賣老的自稱「老作家。」</p>
<p>孫伏老自從去成都齊魯大學教書後，我有半年以上的時間沒有會到過他。當我每次去上清寺美專校街中外出版社拜訪時；去是滿肚皮的高興，回來總是悵悵然。那時，我住在江北，進城一次，相當的麻煩，可是我每問那位出版社的先生，他總是像和我開玩笑一樣：</p>
<p>「昨天才去成都！」</p>
<p>或是：</p>
<p>「還沒有來！」</p>
<p>我追問下去，他却說：「過幾天來看！」始終我沒有一次能夠會到他。</p>
<p>去年夏天，我在新民晚報上（渝版）看到一條消息，知道伏老由蓉來渝，第二天又進城去拜訪。那天，我特別去得早，握了手，伏老笑着說：</p>
<p>「你怎麼知道我來的？」</p>
<p>我告訴他是看見報上的消息，又告訴他我來過有五次之多，沒有一次遇到。那天中午，在美專校街一個館子裏，喝了老酒，吃了麺。以後，我又告訴他，我將東返，恐不容易找到工作，而且上海生活太高，怕受不了。伏老隨即提筆，沒有絲毫勉強。寫了一封信介紹我到上海拜訪一位權威文藝刊物的編者。伏老說：</p>
<p>「他一定能爲你設法。」</p>
<p>東返後，因爲經濟的壓力，在上海逗留了兩天，就回到老家，一直到今天，伏老的介紹信，仍舊存在我的箱子裏。</p>
<p>「我也希望伏老來多做一些魯迅研究的工作，以正確的見解，介紹於新時代中的青年。」我認爲伏老研究魯迅先生是最透徹的一人。</p>
<p>伏老喜歡抽烟、喝酒，品茶，他說：</p>
<p>「沒有烟酒茶，絕對寫不出文章；有了烟酒茶，未必寫得出文章。」</p>
<p>我曉得伏老最喜愛吃「炒鱔糊」，每次我們吃飯，幾乎都有這個菜。</p>
<p>伏老在化龍橋中央日報編副刊的時候，差不多每天都去化龍橋街上那家呌「慶馀飯館」的舖子裏，吃麵，酒，菜。那家店的招牌也是伏老的手筆。他說：</p>
<p>「這個老闆是一個很好的典型人物，可以寫在小說裏。」</p>

<h3>愛的秘密</h3>
<p>— RBurns　田禽譯</p>
<p>從不想訴說你的愛，</p>
<p>愛永遠是不能訴說的；</p>
<p>因爲溫和的風飄拂</p>
<p>是寂靜的，看不到的。</p>
<p>我訴說我的愛，我訴說我的愛，</p>
<p>我告訴我的整個心靈</p>
<p>顫抖着，冰冷，在死般的恐怖中。</p>
<p>唔！她已經離去！</p>
<p>她離開我不久之後，</p>
<p>一個旅客前來，</p>
<p>寂靜的，看不到的：</p>
<p>他悲傷的帶着嘆息。</p>
<h3>一寸河山一寸血　198</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「吼……！」冒牌的「金司令」表示把事情弄清楚了，「原來您二位都在這裹……真的在這裹……！對不起，我們可以談談……！」說了這聲「對不起」，她立刻轉身，對身後的兩隻糞蛆之一,大聲吆喝道：「去一個人，告訴大隊長，這大樓是我們自己人的，全部手下，分三路抵抗，維持車交民巷聯絡……快去！」</p>
<p>這糞蛆之一，到時個異常乖覺的傢伙。他親眼看到剛才那個探報，惡狗撲屎，跌了那麼一下重的，很費力才爬起來，當着這多人面前，如此露臉，到底有些難看，損失了不少「大和魂皇軍」的威風；所以他一得到命令，立即舉手行了一個軍禮，表示「得令」，然後，先把自己這幅糞蛆身段，輕輕的抖動了一下，試試看這個地板，究竟抖到什麽程度；看看實在太滑，這才擺起了兩隻胳膊，像馬戲場上走軟索似的，提起一雙腳來，先向前　進一步，使出鶴行鷺步式子。這一脚踏實了地板，才把另一雙脚跟進，身體也跟着轉動，在這位嫡嫡親親的上司面前，鬧了一個大轉灣，這才一步一探，走了出去。這麼一來，他認爲始終保全了沒有爬下去的面子。可就沒有想到，這種動作，從旁人看去，難免疑心「這傢伙大概有毛病，而且毛病不輕」哩。</p>
<p>「原來兩位都在這裏」，冒牌的川島芳子，重又對萍子鶴見淡淡地說着：「早曉得是這麼一個場面，我很不應該如此冒眛……好在我的任務一方面雖說搜查「不穩份子」，一方面也是要實行「保衛」咱們自己人。……」</p>
<p>「承情得很！」鶴見冷冷地插入了這麼一句，恢復了他的標準東京口音，還來了一個鞠躬式。「在下面受着保護，一面還在保護人，哈，這才有意思得很。」</p>
<p>「希望閣下保護的盡是自己人好哩！」這冒牌傢伙面孔上罩着一層陰暗的冷笑。</p>
<p>「得了，得了！」萍子仍舊含着笑意，似乎在打圓場，預備把兩方面拉攏。「我們都別提「保護」這兩個罷，哪一方面都是奉了命令來的，還得顧全大局才好啦！」</p>
<p>「命令的來路，各有不同吧！」米子臉上更其陰暗了，「可是我得着實請教一句……這座大樓，聽說複雜得很，你二位是不是負責，担保沒有潛伏的敵方特務。負責的話，我可以立刻回去，照二位的意思報告。如其不能負責，最好還是讓我施行檢查罷！」</p>
<p>這兩句話，無異一拍兩響的雙料耳光，鶴見和萍子，均均勻勻，一人臉上一下，齊耳根子打個正着。萍子呢，性情溫和，也許不會怎樣動氣。可是鶴見生性有些暴躁，我很替他躭心，怕他沉不住氣，要爆發起來了。</p>
<p>「井上小姐的話很對」，鶴見似乎還能沉得住氣，「負責的話，我們暫且不談。這個理由很簡單，因爲鄙人不必對井上小姐負責，也不能對貴上司川島芳子小姐負責，更不必對貴部部長土肥原主任負責……」</p>

<h3>夢</h3>
<p>— 青果</p>
<p>「夢」，還有「幸福」，誰能夠解說呢？</p>
<p>在黑夜裏，可以安詳地睡覺，安詳地做夢。</p>
<p>夢裏有另一個世界。許多人，許多代，就生長在那裏，享受在那裏，死亡在那裏。</p>
<p>但你要是燃亮一盞燈去看躺着做夢的人，可以看見他們在笑，在哭，在說，在唱，……可是你該明白，做夢的人是不會知道的。</p>
<p>做夢的人也許是幸福的。</p>
<p>而我却願望做夢的人有一天能夠真正的醒過來，在燃亮的燈光下，覺察到自己是怎樣地躺在一間小屋子的床上，覺察到在冷森森的角落裏，繚繞着連自己也不懂得的從夢中發出來的囈語。</p>

<h3>田壽雜碎</h3>
<p>— 黑雲</p>
<p>田壽昌先生五十大壽，在文藝界，戲劇界，電影界都應該是件大事，因爲田先生本身就是一部中國戲劇的革新史，由「南國社」爲起點，直到他從事各種地方戲，平劇的改革運動，確爲中國數十年來戲劇界劃下一道輝煌的史時！</p>
<p>因爲壽星的交遊廣闊，賀壽的人各方面的人都有，這不愧爲卅六年文藝界戲劇界電影界的大集合。</p>
<p>許多平日不容易見面的人，今天也在這兒會到了；許多十幾年沒見面的朋友，今天也歡天喜地在這裏握手談心了。</p>
<p>寗波同鄉會的禮堂并不大，於是人特別擠。尤其是入口的地方，真是磨肩擦背，水洩不通。</p>
<p>胸襟上誰都綴著一塊，「田壽」的紅綢條，因爲大家喜氣洋洋，於是誰都有喝喜酒的風采。</p>
<p>我且爲你白描幾個人物：</p>
<p>「壽星」田漢，戴了頂法蘭西便帽，長袍一件，規規矩矩地坐在前三排，有時候被拉到台上去，有時候又想跑下台來。有一次他剛想下來，被洪深抓住了又拉回去。大家有事一陣轟聲大笑。有人在台下悄悄地說：</p>
<p>「壽星還害臊呢！」</p>
<p>洪深主持台上賀壽節目，有說有笑，對每一個節目的出場，總作一個簡單的介紹。</p>
<p>賀壽致詞人物，種種色色，每一個人上場都很饒風趣。如葉聖陶的讀壽詩，他一口土話，再三說他不能說國語。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳溫淑如好女子，靜靜地在播音機前說着話；而郭沫若則又如電光閃閃中的「春雷」，每一句話，台下和之一片掌聲。潘公展先生致詞，更不失爲一篇好的演講詞。周信芳講話，到精彩處，麒派十足。</p>
<p>台下面，影劇人，名導演，大學教授新聞記者，多的如過江之鲫。試寫幾個人物看：準備登台參加「暴風雨中七個女性」朗誦節目的舒綉愛，圍着條乳黃色的圍巾，在走道上和朋友說着閑話；白楊灰色大衣，一身春裝；張瑞芳和剛從美國回來的曹禺擠來擠去；金素琴，金素雯坐在頂後排，記得當年金素琴曾演出改良平劇「桃花扇」等，現在憔悴多了。金燄眼睛上生東西，和吳永剛們在一起，鄭君里，黃晨，都躲在角上；金山，趙丹當年的小生，現在處境都不同了。金山現得胖得多，趙丹還是「遙遠的愛」中漂亮大學教授的風姿。</p>
<p>應雲衛站在角上和人在說笑，此老好像掉了牙齒，唐槐秋夾了大衣，準備朗誦「蘇州夜話」。當年在南市演出此劇，帶走多少人熱淚。</p>
<p>台上節目多得很，　劇討得滿堂彩，笑聲不絕,地方戲以後，還有很多精彩的表演。</p>
<p>程艷秋，袁雪芬等着登台致賀詞，晚間會賓樓，眾賓客與田壽星準備喝個狂醉。</p>
<h3>舊調—重彈</h3>
<p>— 學譯</p>
<p>一個冬天的晚上，我和妹妹兩人做在火爐前讀那男朋友寄來的情書，此時爸爸正在埋頭看報，可是最後他終於忍不住，並且大聲叱責着說：「求上帝救我們脫離這些不堪入耳的聲音」。當時母親聽見了，她一聲不響的放下了正在編織的絨綫褲，並且暗示我們跟她出去。當我們重新回到房間裏的時候，我們那位年老的爸爸在喃喃不斷得咒駡那些年輕小伙子。我們忍不住就告訴他說：「爸爸，你還沒有聽過那最壞的呢，讓我們讀給你聽吧」！於是妹妹就繼續的讀下去。這事一封充滿着熱情而好像又能使人覺得溫和蕩漾的信。可是還沒有讀完，爸爸就怒喊着說：「不，不，我從來沒有聽見過這樣肉麻的東西，我禁止你們回覆這封信」。我們也不理他，讓他獨自怒駡了一陣，然而心裏却在暗笑，因爲當我們吧信給他看的時候，才知道這封信乃是一九一五年一月一日爸爸自己寄給媽媽的情書。（譯自一九四七年二月份讀者文摘"Love's　Old　Sweet　Song"）</p>

<p>台灣民間文學，在文學上應有其價值。早年梁啟超氏，及台灣近人李獣璋君，搜集特多。台灣竹枝詞，爲台灣男女流行的歌詞，譯其詞意，惻惻然若不勝「谷風」「小辮」之怨者，足徵過去半世紀遺黎之哀傷。茲掇梁氏所輯，編整如後：</p>
<p>（一）郎家住在三重埔，妾家住在白石湖；路頭相望無幾步，郎試回頭見妾無？</p>
<p>（二）韮菜花開心一枝，花正黃時葉正肥；願郎摘花連葉摘，到死心頭不肯離。</p>
<p>（三）相思樹底說相思，思郎恨郎郎不知，樹頭結得相思子，可是郎行思妾時。</p>
<p>（四）手握柴刀入柴山，柴心未斷做柴攀，郎自薄情出手易，柴枝離樹何時還？</p>
<p>（五）郎搥大鼓妾打鑼，稽首天西媽祖婆；今生夠受相思苦，乞取他生無折磨。</p>
<p>（六）綠陰陰處打檳榔，蘸得蒟酱待勸郎；願郎到口摸嫌澀，箇中甘苦郎細嘗。</p>
<p>（七）芋芒花開直勝筆，梧桐揃尾西照日，郎如露裏向陽花，妾似風前出頭葉。</p>
<p>（八）教郎早來郎恰晚，教郎大步郎寬寬，满擬待郎十年好，五年未滿愁心肝。</p>
<p>（九）蕉葉長大難遮陽，蔗花雖好不禁霜；蕉肥遮老有人食，欲寄郎行愁路長。</p>

<h3>藍馬·上官雲珠在「天堂春夢」中</h3>
<h3>書生之用</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>當我在中學校唸書的時候，有一位老師曾經對我們說，每一件事物，都有不同的幾個方面，一個人因爲所立地位的不同，他所看到的食物的形態，亦與別人不同。譬如我站在一戶人家的後門，祗見垃圾滿地；另一個人站在那家前門，他得到的印象是侯門深鎖；第三個人走進裏面，他的描狀是書樑雕楝。還有一個人半夜裏走進去，又覺得裏面陰氣森森。其實所謂垃圾滿地，所謂侯門深鎖，以至於書樑雕楝，陰氣森森，都不過是一件事物的各個方面，合起來是整個，分開來是單一的方面，每一方面都不錯，可是每一方面都不能夠代表全體。</p>
<p>十餘年來，這句話我從來沒有忘記。它給我一個容寬的人生觀，使我不偏執一己的見解，對於任何人的荒誕的理論，都願意想法去理解，不敢加以輕視。甚至一般人所說的「光明面」與「黑暗面」，在我也另具了一種意義。</p>
<p>殊不知這樣的見解，近年來竟成了一個可笑的諷刺。我認識一位記者，他在某地擔任國內兩大報的通訊員。這兩大報的立場絕不相同，可是他寫起通訊來却左右逢源，毫無問題，對於任何事物，他既能看見光明，又能看見黑暗，這光明與黑暗，分別在兩個地方出現，讓兩批讀者得到兩個截然相反的印象，因而懷抱兩個不同的主張。這兩個主張，就是同一位記者的生花妙筆之下所造成的。</p>
<p>人們說「百無一用是書生」，看了這個情形，大概可以知道書生是另有其用處的了。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「你們的事好辦了，可是，國家的那些茶葉呢？茶葉不就是物資嗎？」老祝冷笑著說：「國家的外匯就是賣茶葉來的。可是跟你們的汗衫，毛巾，絲襪，襯衫，白報紙，道林紙一比，茶葉便一錢也不值了！是不是？」</p>
<p>徐紹明被他說得也不禁臉上一紅。</p>
<p>「唉！老兄！」他告饒得喊。</p>
<p>「放心吧，我是奈何你們不得的！」老祝放下兩腿，改成了做的姿勢。「現在這種動盪的年代，真是你們生意人和貪官污吏的世界！混水摸魚。老話不就是這樣說嗎？我們黨新聞記者的，幹戲劇運動的，都是一文不值的蠢貨。能吧你們怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>對方聽約有些局促不安起來。</p>
<p>「你絕對不必擔心，」他說的話雖是那樣的富於諷刺性，但臉上却還是嬉皮笑臉的。「你想我會去告你們嗎？官官相護，我老祝不能那樣獃，在報上寫文章罵你們，編戲挖苦你們，都不會！現在我都看透了，文章寫得再好也沒有用，戲演得在動人也沒有用。中國社會上，現在有一般人的心已變成了不可感動的化石；他們一樣也看報，一樣也看戲，好的文章他們也會稱讚，好的戲他們也會拍手。可是放下報紙，走出戲館，什麽印象都沒有了！他們還是他們！……」</p>
<p>徐紹明只是搖頭，幾次想插言都差不進去。這時候屋子裏已多了一個人；徐紹明就望她苦笑了一笑；老祝正說的上勁，並沒有注意。</p>
<p>進來的那個人是一位長身玉立，相貌極秀美的少婦。她的舉止和衣飾都有力地說明了她是受過高等教育而又識見充足的女性。但當她的實現和老祝的臉接觸時，全身就想觸電似的一震，周身的神經都緊張了起來；雖然他的優美的素養使她仍能竭力控制自己，外秒上一會兒就回覆了平靜的狀態，可是他的暮光已無法再從這一條瘦長的身影上移開了。（十四）</p>

<h3>The Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee Opens This Morning; President Chiang Decides to Preside in Person; Preparatory Meeting Held in the Afternoon to Discuss the Agenda</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 15th at the National Assembly Hall. This historically significant building will once again receive this glorious task. In this meeting, the Kuomintang will discuss how to implement constitutional governance, return power to the people, and enable China to embark on a truly free and democratic path. The hall's entrance has been worked on overnight, adding a horizontal banner with a yellow background and long stripes of red, white, and blue. The top line is horizontally written "Kuomintang of China," and the bottom line reads "Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee," with party emblems painted at both ends. The second entrance of the hall has a registration desk for attending committee members, still using the card format from the National Assembly. On the wall behind the rostrum inside the hall, a large portrait of the Founding Father and the party and national flags are hung. Twenty-two seats and oval tables are set up on the stage. Four party flags, each twenty feet long, are hung on both walls, and electric voting machines are also being installed. In addition to the First Constitution Regiment responsible for security, the police are responsible for traffic control, and the parking lot will be arranged as it was during the National Assembly meeting. The entire venue inside and outside is solemnly decorated. Today, Linsen Road is bustling with traffic and filled with dignitaries. As of noon yesterday, more than half of the Central Committee members have reported for registration. The area around the meeting venue is heavily guarded, and all Central Committee members must wear an entry pass to pass through. The meeting is rumored to last ten days, and this meeting will make extremely important decisions regarding the entire national policy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM on the 15th at the National Assembly Hall. President Chiang will preside in person over the opening ceremony. After the ceremony, he will lead all attendees to pay respects at the mausoleum. A preparatory meeting will be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to discuss the meeting agenda, the deadline for proposals, and elect the presidium of the assembly. This plenary session is the first since the return to the capital after victory and is held after the closing of the National Assembly and before the implementation of the constitution on December 25th this year. The timing and the meeting are of great significance, as it marks the Kuomintang's ending of political tutelage, returning power to the people, completing its fifty-year goal of leading the national revolution, and realizing the main goal of revolutionary struggle and striving for democratic politics. The question now is how to complete the preparatory work before the implementation of the constitution to guide the Chinese people onto the path of democratic politics. The convening of the Third Plenary Session is precisely for this task. Therefore, all reforms in party affairs, politics, economics, and diplomacy at this stage, as well as the streamlining of the tax system, the easing of tax burdens, and the preparation for the implementation of constitutional governance, are all under close study. This plenary session is held one year after the Second Plenary Session convened in Chongqing on March 1st of last year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The registration of Central Committee members for the Third Plenary Session continued on the 14th, the third day, with a total of 104 members registering, including 48 executive committee members, 28 alternate executive committee members, 22 supervisory committee members, and 6 alternate supervisory committee members, bringing the total number of registered members to 256, including the previous two days.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 14th] Central Committee members He Chengjun and Xu Yuanquan will take the Jiang'an steamer to Beijing on the morning of the 15th to attend the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 14th] Shen Honglie left for Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 14th, transferring to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session, accompanied by Ruan Yicheng.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 14th] Ji Supervisory Commissioner Shuai Sicong changed his flight to Beijing to the 15th, accompanied by Wang Bingjun, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Party Department, and Zhang Bojin, deputy mayor of Beiping, to attend the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Constitutional Proposals</h3>

<h3>Outline of Economic Policies Still Needs Discussion and Revision</h3>

<h3>Total Number of National Assembly Delegates</h3>
<p>Reaching 2,912 According to the Constitution</p>
<p>Approximately 565 Members of the Legislative Yuan to Be Elected</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] With the implementation of the constitution approaching, all parties are extremely concerned about the election of National Assembly delegates and members of the Legislative Yuan. According to reliable sources, the total number of National Assembly delegates will reach 2,912. The first category is delegates elected from each county, city, and equivalent area. According to the constitution, each of the above units may elect one delegate, and for every 500,000 people exceeding 500,000, one additional delegate may be elected, with the total number reaching 2,130. The second category is delegates from Mongolia and Tibet, with four from each Mongolian league and one from each special banner, with a total of 87. The third category is delegates elected from ethnic groups in border areas, with a total of 14. The fourth category is delegates elected from citizens residing abroad, estimated at 57. The fifth category is occupational delegates, estimated at 450. The sixth category is women's delegates, at 168. If divided by region, it is said that the provinces in southeastern China can produce 73 delegates from Jiangsu Province, 78 from Zhejiang Province, 65 from Anhui Province, 68 from Fujian Province, and 84 from Jiangxi Province. However, the above numbers are not final and may be subject to increase or decrease. Furthermore, according to the constitution, the election of members of the Legislative Yuan shall be based on the following regulations: First, those elected from each province and city under the direct jurisdiction of the central government, with a population of 3 million or less, shall have 5 members. Those exceeding 3 million shall have one additional member for every 1 million people. From the perspective of the southeastern provinces, Jiangsu can elect 38 people, Zhejiang 23 people, Anhui 23 people, Jiangxi 15 people, Fujian 13 people, and Beijing and Shanghai each elect 5 people, with the total number reaching 56 people.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Unfolds in Nong'an and Dehui</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8:00 PM on the 14th] The offensive and defensive battle for Chengan, a satellite of Changchun, is now underway. Dehui County is also under siege by the Communist army. The Northeast Communist army seems to be trying to show off its strength during the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to dazzle international attention. The National Army will also not easily let go of the great opportunity to strike the main force of the Northeast Communist army. Heavy snow has been falling in the Songjiang area for several days, slightly delaying military operations, but the National Army's planned deployments are still being completed as scheduled. The next 100 hours will be the most decisive time.</p>
<h3>Yan'an Headquarters Decides to Launch Spring General Offensive</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] According to reliable information, the Yan'an Communist Army Headquarters has indeed decided to launch a spring general offensive starting in March, targeting the Ping-Sui and Zheng-Tai railways as the offensive objectives, attempting to capture transportation lines first and then achieve complete occupation from a local level. The main force will be the various units under the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, supplemented by the Suiyuan and Kou-Liang military regions. Nie Rongzhen is the commander-in-chief, and Xiao Ke is the commander. The offensive area is divided into three routes.</p>
<h3>Speculative Capital is Hesitating and Watching; The Central Government Deeply Feels the Importance of the People's Livelihood Principle</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] It has been a month since the promulgation of the economic emergency measures. On the surface, the chaotic situation in the economic world has been somewhat stabilized. However, according to observations by an economic expert, it is not yet time to be completely optimistic. The speculative capital in the market is currently in a period of hesitation and watching. If there is no appropriate way to guide it into the right track of production, it is still difficult to expect great results. A general review believes that the first priority of economic policy in the future should be to restore the government's credibility. In terms of policies and systems, it is necessary to make a major determination and show with facts that the government will never break its promise to the people. All measures should be considerate of the people's hardships and should not compete with the people for profits. It is necessary to ensure that production develops, so that people can use their talents to the fullest, others can use their resources to the fullest, things can be used to the fullest, and goods can flow smoothly. In short, economic policy must be based on the principle of the people's livelihood to be active. If one only knows how to accumulate wealth, it is definitely not the way to manage the country's finances. It is said that the central authorities have a deep feeling about this, which is a better sign before the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>National Army Recovers Da Wen Kou; Fierce Battle for Si Shui in Progress; Communist Army Offensive in Jiaodong Also Crushed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 14th] The National Army, which had reached the south bank of the Wen River, crossed the Wen River on the morning of the 14th and recovered Da Wen Kou at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The remaining Communist army fled in disarray towards Tai'an. Furthermore, the National Army, which recovered Feicheng on the west side of the Jinpu Railway, continued to advance north on the 14th and recovered strongholds such as Da Shi Town, Liu Zhuang, and Guan Wang Temple north of the city. They will soon join forces with the National Army advancing south from Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 14th] The battle for Si Shui is fierce. The National Army in Qufu is now attacking Si Shui from two routes. One route, after recovering Xing Shan and Jian Shan southwest of Si Shui, is now only two or three kilometers away from Si Shui. National Army sentries are now active outside the city gates of Si Shui. The other route of the National Army recovered Wang Xun west of the city on the 14th. The Communist army in Si Shui has become a turtle in a jar.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 14th] The Northern Expeditionary Army has completed a large encirclement of about 50,000 Communist troops gathered near Tai'an, including three divisions, one garrison brigade, and local teams. As for the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, after the National Army completed its new deployment, the Communist army's attempts to occupy Qingdao, Weixian, and Changle were all crushed.</p>
<h3>Communist Soldiers on the Border of Shanxian and Dangshan Defect with Weapons</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 14th] Liu Fenglin, commander of the Fifth Company of the Hua-Dang Brigade of the Communist army, and instructor Chen Mingwen, who had been harassing the border of Shanxian and Dangshan, led 24 men and defected to the National Army with their weapons on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Molotov's Proposal is Unanimously Opposed Nationally</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Since Molotov proposed at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that the China issue should be included on the agenda, protests have erupted across the country.</p>
<p>People's organizations and student circles in Hankou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Kunming, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Shenyang, Chongqing, and other places have launched patriotic rights protection movements and have held protest demonstrations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, more than ten universities in Shanghai, including National Fudan University, have established patriotic rights protection movement assemblies, preparing for class boycotts and demonstrations.</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Mr. Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party issued a written statement yesterday regarding the Moscow Conference, stating: "Recently, the fact that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed that the China issue should be included in the agenda has attracted worldwide attention, especially the exchange of cables in our country, expressing that our internal affairs should not be interfered with by other countries. This is a fundamental principle in international affairs that should be adhered to by any country. However, strictly speaking, if Mr. Molotov's proposal is regarded as interference in internal affairs, then how are the previous statements by the three foreign ministers in Moscow and the statement by US President Truman not criticisms of our internal affairs? As the saying goes, 'A country must insult itself before others insult it.' Another saying goes, 'The best way to stop slander is to improve oneself.' It is right for the people of our country to oppose international interference, but we must go further to seek the thorough democratization of our country's politics, the cessation of civil war, and the establishment of a coalition government. Then the four powers will welcome us to Moscow too much to reject the attendance of our country's representatives. Recently, domestic public opinion has focused on opposing international interference, in other words, not allowing discussion of the China issue. I believe that if China does not send representatives, other countries will naturally not be allowed to discuss it. However, since the four powers have already agreed to informally discuss the China issue, our country should immediately notify them of our participation and protect our rights in a dignified manner. We must never adopt the attitude of 'rejecting people thousands of miles away.' The China issue is part of the world's problems. If China is peaceful, the world can be peaceful. Our country should immediately plan to participate in the delegation to the Moscow Conference. It is most appropriate for President Sun Ke and Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to attend. The policies to be adopted are: (1) Strengthen friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. (2) Clearly inform Russia that there are no secret agreements between China and the United States to oppose the Soviet Union. (3) China's disunity will be a barrier to friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union and a fuse for world peace. (4) The withdrawal of troops from the Northeast and the restoration of traffic on the China-Changchun Railway. (5) China is willing to resolve the Communist Party issue politically. A. Implement the troop reorganization plan. B. The Communist Party participates in the government. C. The administration of each province must be within the scope of the constitution. If the above five items are explained clearly to the four powers by our country's delegation, not only can our country's internal affairs embark on the path of peace and unity, but it will also contribute to friendship between the Soviet Union and the United States and world peace. Perhaps some people will object, thinking that this is our country's internal affairs and there is no need to defend it to outsiders. However, no matter how our country opposes it, the four countries will definitely raise this issue for discussion. It is better to be open than to be secretive, it is better for us to participate than to let others discuss it, and it is better to let this boil burst in the open than to let it lie dormant inside. This is a major key in our country's diplomacy and the world's political situation. I hope our government and the public will think about it calmly."</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference; Legislative Yuan Resolves to Revoke</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] When the Legislative Yuan discussed current diplomatic issues on the morning of the 14th, legislators such as Chen Anren loudly called for "diplomacy to strive for the initiative." Regarding the fact that the Moscow Conference will discuss our internal affairs within and outside the meeting, they all advocated that representatives should not be sent to participate. Today, the atmosphere in the meeting hall was激昂激昂 and enthusiastic, with applause coming from all directions from time to time. Foreign Minister Gan Naiguang was also invited to attend and reported on current diplomatic measures and made a detailed analysis. This important issue was caused by the "request to send representatives to participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference based on the Potsdam Conference resolution" proposed by legislators such as Chen Anren. After discussion, it was generally believed that since the government authorities had already announced that they would not send representatives to participate, the original proposal did not seem necessary to be established, and it was resolved to revoke it.</p>
<h3>Our Government Reaffirms Its Position and Decides Not to Send Representatives to Participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference; The US Representative Claims That He Will Change His Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] According to reliable sources: On the morning of the 14th, our government, through diplomatic channels, notified the four countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, reaffirming our country's position on the Moscow Conference, clearly stating that China will not send representatives to participate in discussions on the China issue whether inside or outside the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov once proposed convening a conference of British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers and inviting China to participate to consider the implementation of the Three Foreign Ministers' Statement on China in 1945. According to Chinese officials, the Chinese government's attitude was declared by Liu Jie in the previous statement by Foreign Minister Wang. The Chinese government has refused to accept the above proposal, because China was not a participant in the 1945 Three Foreign Ministers' Statement on China, and that statement involved China's internal affairs and was vehemently opposed by the Chinese people when it was issued.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Standing Committee of the National Political Consultative Council held its 18th decision meeting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, chaired by Mo Dehui. Foreign Minister Wang was temporarily invited to give a diplomatic report. Mr. Wang gave a detailed explanation of matters related to the 草斯科 Foreign Ministers Conference and other matters. Subsequently, the proposals were discussed, and many important cases were passed.

<h3>Supervisory Yuan Issues Original Impeachment of Bei Zuyi and Others for Illegal Neglect of Duty; National Political Consultative Council Asks Government to Deal with It Strictly According to Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Standing Committee of the National Political Consultative Council discussed today the proposal by Luo Heng and others to request the government to severely punish Bei 　詒, Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and other former central bank executives in charge, for taking advantage of their powers, colluding with officials and merchants, undermining national policy, illegally seeking profits, intentionally creating a gold rush, stimulating prices, thereby hindering people's livelihoods, and shaking the government's prestige. They should be immediately handed over to the judicial organs for strict handling according to law, in order to cleanse officialdom and warn against effect. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for prompt and effective handling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The four supervisory committee members, He Hanwen, Wan Can, Gu Fengxiang, and Zhang Qingzhen, who were ordered to investigate the gold rush, after submitting detailed investigation reports to the Supervisory Yuan, recently proposed an impeachment case to the Supervisory Yuan based on their findings, believing that Bei Zuyi, former governor of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, director of the Business Bureau, Yang Anren, deputy director, and Wang Songtao, assistant manager, had illegally neglected their duties. The case was handed over by the Supervisory Yuan to the supervisory committee members Jin Yufu, Wang Zixian, and Yu Shude for review, who submitted a review report requesting that Bei Zuyi and others be transferred for disciplinary action. The original text of the impeachment case and the review report were released by the Supervisory Yuan on the 14th. The original text of the impeachment case is as follows:</p>
<p>Original Text of the Impeachment Case</p>
<p>For the impeachment matter: The gold rush has had a profound and enormous impact on the national economy and people's livelihoods. The committee members were ordered to investigate the gold rush situation. After thoroughly investigating the actual situation of the Central Bank's execution of gold buying and selling operations, it was generally agreed that the bank's governor, Bei Zuyi, director of the Business Bureau, Lin Fengbao, and deputy director, Yang Anren, had the following illegal and derelict facts:</p>
<p>The Fraud is Clearly Visible</p>
<p>(1) The Central Bank's gold reserve figure is related to national secrets and has a significant impact on the future implementation of the gold policy. However, Bei Zuyi and others sold all the gold blocks and handed them over to Tongfengyu to be responsible for distributing them to Dafengheng, Hongfengyong, Shengyuanyong, Jiuchengyong, Yang Qinghe Fa Ji, Yufayong Xianghe, and other gold shops. They signed contracts to divide the gold bars into 99% pure gold and distribute them to various gold shops and silver buildings. The Central Bank gave Tongfengyu a smelting loss of three-tenths of an ounce per ten taels (see Zhan Liansheng's interrogation transcript). The Central Bank's entire sales of gold smelting volume has been made known to Tongfengyu. Furthermore, according to the statements of Zhan Liansheng and the persons in charge of Taikangrun, Fang Jiuxia Chang Ji, and Yang Qinghe Fa Ji (see interrogation transcripts), all the gold distributed by the Central Bank to the five designated firms had to be stamped by Zhan Liansheng, the person in charge of Tongfengyu, before it could be received. The total amount of gold sold by the Central Bank was made known to Zhan Liansheng. Tongfengyu is the largest firm in the gold industry, and Zhan Liansheng is an magnate in gold speculation. It is not difficult for him to deduce the amount of gold stored in the Central Bank based on this total amount and take the opportunity to engage in speculative duels with the gold policy to obtain huge profits. If Bei Zuyi and others did not intentionally leak this secret, they could have handed the gold bricks over to the Central Mint for melting. Even if the Mint's equipment was incomplete and it had to seek gold shops and silver buildings, it should have been entrusted separately and not entrusted to Tongfengyu to take charge of the matter, and let Zhan Liansheng be responsible for stamping. If the five firms designated to be responsible for gold distribution work (Tongfengyu, Taikangrun, Dafengheng, Fang Jiuxia Chang Ji, Yang Qinghe Fa Ji) were indeed designated by the Central Bank according to a certain standard, then they could each handle the procedures for receiving gold bars from the Central Bank, so why should Zhan Liansheng be solely responsible for this matter? The fraud in it is already clearly visible.</p>
<p>It is a Collusion Between Officials and Merchants</p>
<p>(2) The Central Bank sells gold and designates the above five firms to be responsible. The daily gold price is also determined based on telephone reports from the five firms to the Central Bank. The responsibilities of the five firms are very important. However, the Central Bank's designation of the five firms responsible for gold distribution work was all decided by Bei Zuyi, Lin Fengbao, and Yang Anren without any standards (see the gold rush investigation report), which is already inappropriate. Moreover, these five firms were all introduced by Zhan Liansheng alone (see interrogation transcripts). It is obvious that the Central Bank's sale of gold is intentionally controlled and manipulated by Zhan Liansheng alone in the market. It is not excessive to call it collusion between officials and merchants.</p>
<p>Secret Strategies of Unauthorized Sale</p>
<p>(3) The gold sold by the Central Bank every day, in addition to the explicit distribution issued by the gold industry and silver building guilds based on the applications of each member, the secret sale of gold bars, the Central Bank distributed to the five firms, and then let them freely dispose of them. Not only is the decision of the price controlled by Zhan Liansheng, but the limited gold of the country is exclusively for the infinite desire of gold speculation. The number of gold reserves is decreasing day by day, and the issuance of legal tender is increasing day by day. It is obvious that the Central Bank will have a day when it will be stretched and trapped. However, this secret sales strategy was not decided by the government and should be the office of Bei, Lin, and Yang.</p>
<p>Conniving at Suspicions of Subordinates</p>
<p>(4) After reviewing the gold bar sales accounts of the five gold distribution firms, there are dozens of gold purchases listed by Central Bank colleagues, totaling more than one hundred. Even Wang Songtao, who manages the gold inventory, also purchased gold bars. Bei Zuyi and others did not impose any restrictions on them, and there is suspicion of conniving subordinates to be involved in gold speculation.</p>
<p>Severe Punishment to Clean Up Discipline</p>
<p>(5) Bei Zuyi and others know the Central Bank's gold buying and selling situation best. Since the beginning of January this year, before the gold price gradually rose and the gold policy could not be sustained, Bei Zuyi and others should have reported the situation truthfully and made other good methods. However, it was not until February 8 that Bei Zuyi went to Beijing to ask for instructions. On the evening of February 9, he returned to Shanghai by car and suddenly announced the suspension of gold distribution the next morning, resulting in a sharp rise in gold prices and an unmanageable situation. The central government had to announce the economic emergency measures on the 16th. According to Bei Zuyi and others, this sudden suspension of distribution was ordered by the Chairman, but according to the committee members' investigation, the Chairman had no such instruction. From this, it can be seen that Bei Zuyi and others have already done wrong in their arrangements and have actually shifted the responsibility to the highest authorities, which is extremely illegal. Based on the above facts, the Central Bank's Governor Bei Zuyi, Director of the Business Bureau Lin Fengbao, Deputy Director Yang Anren, and Assistant Manager Wang Songtao, are obviously illegally neglecting their duties. Failure to severely punish them is not enough to cleanse the discipline and warn the evil officials. I hereby propose an impeachment case according to law and request that they be transferred for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Review Report</p>
<p>For the matter of the review report: The case of illegally neglecting their duties of the Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi and others impeached by Committee Member He Hanwen and others was handed over. After review by the committee members, it was generally agreed that the Central Bank's sale of gold to stabilize prices is a very important matter. The important responsible personnel of the bank did not make strict regulations in advance, giving奸奸 merchants the opportunity to profit, which is already a breach of duty. To entrust the responsibility of all distribution to the speculative merchant Zhan 　生 to handle, and to leak the secrets that should be kept in office to the contractor, there is obviously fraud in it. To allow the bank's employees to get involved and not investigate, there is even more connivance. When it is impossible to收拾收场, they claim that the Chairman ordered the sudden suspension of distribution, which is also illegal. The Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi, Director of the Business Bureau Lin Fengbao, Deputy Director Yang Anren, and Assistant Manager Wang Songtao, should be transferred for disciplinary action, as a warning to those who illegally neglect their duties.</p>

<h3>Local Reporters Issue Declaration Opposing International Interference in China</h3>
<p>[Local News] Shanghai journalists, in opposition to international interference, issued a special declaration yesterday stating:</p>
<p>On the first day of the Moscow Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov actually proposed to include the China issue on the agenda. He wants to instigate the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to jointly interfere in China.</p>
<p>This unfriendly attitude is not only an intolerable insult to the entire Chinese nation, but also an open provocation to general international law, especially the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union has consistently attacked China. The Chinese people's spirit of neighborliness and the Chinese government's friendly attitude have not changed the Soviet Union's prejudice against China.</p>
<p>At the first London Foreign Ministers Conference in 1945, the Soviet Union excluded China from participating in the drafting of treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Subsequently, China was unable to participate in the second, third, and fourth Foreign Ministers Conferences due to Soviet refusal. Furthermore, at the Second Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, at the instigation of the Soviet Union, the three foreign ministers placed China in the same category as the defeated vassal states of Europe in their declaration. The Soviet Union intentionally attacked China's status as a prelude to its future instigation of interference in China. Before this Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union again opposed China's participation in the meeting, with the intention of facilitating the instigation of interference. This conference was mainly to discuss the treaties with Germany and Austria. China is not a defeated country. Molotov openly demanded that the China issue be discussed on the first day. This shows that the Soviet Union has always held a strong power prejudice against China. As for its so-called Chinese internal affairs, it is just a worn-out excuse for power politics.</p>
<p>We must declare to governments of all countries around the world that China fought bloodily for eight years in the international anti-aggression war. The Chinese army and civilians made the most heroic sacrifices for the victory of the United Nations. China has contributed to the world and is not indebted to the United Nations. We will never recognize the right of one or several countries in the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. So-called international interference is an inseparable part of power politics, which cannot be allowed to revive today and threaten human civilization and survival.</p>
<p>We demand that the government adopt a firm attitude and oppose any discussion of the China issue at any international conference. Now there is talk of the Soviet, American, and British foreign ministers discussing it outside the conference. Even this informal discussion is intolerable to China. The government must not send representatives to participate, and it must insist on opposing it to the end.</p>
<p>We demand that the government announce all the facts about the Soviet Union's actions in the Northeast since the Sino-Soviet Treaty and make them public to the world. The government has published too little about these facts in the past and should make the Chinese people and the world fully understand all the facts and know how those who want to interfere in China today are acting against international morality.</p>
<p>The government has the responsibility to safeguard national independence and dignity. If it can firmly maintain this position, we firmly believe that the people of the whole country will unanimously give their greatest support. Otherwise, the people of the whole country will certainly not tolerate the government's cowardice.</p>
<p>We are all engaged in the news industry and have always advocated international peace and cooperation. Now the Soviet Union's attitude towards China has made anyone who has good feelings towards the Soviet Union deeply resentful. Whether for the sake of international justice or national dignity, we must awaken the people of the whole country to transcend partisan prejudices and unanimously oppose the instigation of interference in China from a solemn national standpoint. We also earnestly hope that all people in the world who advocate peace and justice will pay attention to the interventionism advocated by Molotov, which is not only an insult to China but also a threat to world peace.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang</h3>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang (KMT) solemnly opened in the capital today. This plenary session is the final decisive meeting of the KMT's highest executive body on the eve of returning power to the people and implementing constitutional government. The KMT's own direction and the evolution of future politics will depend on the outcome of this plenary session. Therefore, the significance of this plenary session is already extraordinary and, occurring as it does amidst the current volatile domestic and international situation, deserves the utmost attention from the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The KMT not only has a long history in China but also has indelible achievements in the history of transforming China. In the past, from the Revive China Society and the Tongmenghui onwards, the KMT stood under the revolutionary banner of the Father of the Nation, led the oppressed people of the whole country, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and established the Republic; overthrew Yuan Shikai and repeatedly established a republic; and then swept away the warlords and completed unification. Until recently, when the violent Japanese invaded, the KMT, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, engaged in a holy war, enduring hardship and working tirelessly for eight years, and finally achieved a glorious victory and wrote off the unequal treaties accumulated over a century of humiliation. These are all contributions of the KMT to the country and the nation, which cannot be denied by anyone! They cannot be erased by anyone!</p>
<p>However, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the problem of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) arose one after another, and the fruits of victory began to rot, causing glory to turn into shame. This is a major tragedy in the history of China's transformation. Peace negotiations lasted for more than a year, but ultimately broke down completely due to the CCP's obstinacy and attempt to seize power by force. As a result, the flames of war spread, and northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, central Shandong, eastern Shandong, western Shandong, northern Hebei, northern Shaanxi, and the Northeast all became battlefields where people were killed and rivers of blood flowed. People in the war zone were directly destroyed by artillery fire, and most were displaced, suffering terribly. Even people who were not in the war zone were indirectly affected, transportation was blocked, goods could not circulate smoothly, production was halted, supply could not meet demand, and prices soared, causing social unrest and making people's lives difficult. At the same time, in order to cope with the CCP's offensive, the government had to maintain a considerable army, resulting in huge military expenditures and uncontrollable inflation, which created the current serious situation. People inside and outside the party feel worried and anxious, depressed and gloomy, pessimistic, and even some people complain about everything and blame the KMT for the responsibility for creating the current situation.</p>
<p>If we are fair, the KMT has been in power for 20 years. It has failed to reform the political atmosphere in politics and improve people's livelihood in the economy, resulting in the current serious situation. The KMT really cannot but reflect on itself! Make up its mind and thoroughly reform the traditional system and style to open a new path for Chinese politics and lay a solid foundation for Chinese constitutional government. This is the responsibility that the KMT should fulfill to the country and the people. We are now in the transitional era of implementing constitutional government. As long as the KMT has the determination and perseverance, it is not difficult to make a fresh start with the people. However, all major reform plans will depend on the Third Plenary Session that opens today. In addition to wishing it success, we would also like to take this opportunity to respectfully tell the Chinese KMT a few words.</p>
<p>First, all members of the KMT should revitalize the revolutionary spirit. Only those who have a revitalized and full revolutionary spirit have the fearless spirit, can be optimistic and move forward, and can overcome the current difficulties. As far as the KMT itself is concerned, it has a broad, profound, and up-to-date ideology and a great and outstanding leader. As long as every member has a revolutionary spirit, even after the implementation of constitutional government, when political parties are numerous, the KMT will still be the largest party with the important task of peaceful nation-building. Now we often see people attacking the KMT as reactionary. Regardless of whether the reasons are sufficient, we always feel that KMT members should be ashamed of this and deeply reflect on whether their revolutionary spirit is revitalized and full, and then ask whether their thoughts and actions are outdated and regressive. If they are, they should correct them; if not, they should encourage themselves. Only in this way can the KMT maintain its past vigor. This plenary session will discuss the party affairs reform plan and the general inspection of party members nationwide. We believe that it is imperative to implement it; on the one hand, we can eliminate the base and corrupt elements who do not have a strong belief in the party, and on the other hand, we can gather outstanding people who are truly loyal to the party and loyal to the ideology to jointly shoulder the important task of peaceful nation-building.</p>
<p>Second, the KMT should redouble its efforts during this transitional era of implementing constitutional government to complete all the necessary preparations for implementing constitutional government and open a new path for Chinese politics. Because we ordinary people only hope that China will truly become a new democratic China, and as for the KMT, as long as the KMT itself is truly a democratic and centralized major political party, after returning power to the people, we still hope that it can shoulder the important task of peaceful nation-building. In fact, China and the KMT were inseparable in China's past history, and even in the future, it will not be easy to separate them for a while. Therefore, the KMT's efforts to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government are not only for the Republic of China, but also for the KMT itself.</p>
<p>Third, the reorganization of the government must be fully determined at this plenary session. We ordinary people have long hoped that the government will be reorganized, improve administrative efficiency, and eliminate corrupt officials, but it has been delayed again and again. Until today, the government has not yet realized it, which is really disappointing. We have said above that the greatest expectation of the people of the country for the domestic political situation is to immediately start preparing for the implementation of constitutional government, so as to establish a good model for Chinese constitutional government. Otherwise, time waits for no one, and in the blink of an eye, the date for the start of constitutional government will arrive. If there is no sufficient preparation beforehand, how can we hope that it will be a new look immediately after constitutional government begins?</p>
<p>Finally, we must also point out that people's livelihood must be stable, otherwise everything is out of the question; during this transition period, even if the government is reorganized, its foundation is expanded, and various parties are included, the government is still mainly composed of the KMT, and the KMT is still responsible to the people for all domestic and foreign affairs, as well as financial and economic measures. At present, people's livelihood is suffering beyond description. The KMT should always think of the people and always think of the country, and should not shirk any difficulties and bury itself in doing everything that is beneficial to the people and beneficial to the country. The specific methods of implementing equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital should be implemented to realize the ideal of the Three Principles of the People, and it must not be allowed to continue to let things drift and sit idly by while prices soar, resulting in social unrest and making people's lives difficult. When the Third Plenary Session discusses the economic reform plan, it must come up with specific measures to implement the Three Principles of the People.</p>

<h3>US Senate Committee Passes Preservation of Reserve Military Service Quotas; Both Houses Debated New Foreign Policy Yesterday; Aid to Greece and Turkey Should Be Decided Before the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The US Senate Military Affairs Committee, "due to the perilous world situation," unexpectedly passed a measure today to preserve all reserve registrations with local draft boards, pending congressional enactment of universal military service. The committee took no action on extending the Selective Service Act, which expires on March 31. However, at its last meeting, Secretary of the Army Patterson suddenly attended and expressed the view that, due to US intervention in the Greek and Turkish affairs, local draft boards' reserve registration lists should be temporarily retained so that they could be quickly mobilized if necessary. The committee then unanimously passed the measure to maintain the Selective Service Act as it stands.</p>
<p>At the same time, the highest-ranking officials from the Departments of the Army, Navy, and State are working to urge Congress to quickly pass President Truman's "communist containment" plan. They secretly reported to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the plan for quick economic and military aid to Greece and Turkey is now only 18 days away from the UK's cessation of aid to them. The Washington administration's active preparation for parliamentary battles has been accelerated by Truman's public statement yesterday. It is heard that Secretary of the Army Patterson, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and Acting Secretary of State Acheson presented to Congress the details of how, when, and where the administration would use the Congressionally approved funds to stop the terrible expansion of communism in the Near East.</p>
<p>After a day of congressional meetings, Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that Congress would fully support Truman's anti-communist plan. However, he warned that Congress is not blindly following the administration and will demand all important intelligence on the crisis in the Near East.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] It has been learned that Representative Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a Republican, is scheduled to propose a discussion in the House tomorrow on the President's proposal to loan money to Greece and Turkey. Eaton told reporters today that the House Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold a secret meeting tomorrow to discuss the entire international situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Republican leaders in the Senate are preparing to quickly proceed with President Truman's aid bill for Greece and Turkey so that a decision can be made before the British troops withdraw on March 31. Senator Taft, Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, said that March 31 is an important date. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said that this day is the deadline for the committee to hear opinions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] State Department experts say that most of the $150 million in US loans to Turkey will be used to strengthen Turkey's military organization against any possible attack. At least half of the $250 million in loans to Greece will be used to train and equip the 100,000-strong Greek army to prevent any incidents. Experts also said that US advisors in Greece will lead the Greek government to undertake major economic reforms.</p>
<h3>New US Diplomatic Trends Aimed at Preventing War</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 13th] The new development in American foreign policy is not about actual warfare. Its main intention remains to accomplish what Western nations failed to do more than a decade ago, which is to prevent war. On the other hand, this is an extension of the Monroe Doctrine, expanding the sphere of freedom to any people anywhere, not just the Western Hemisphere. President Truman has in effect declared that America's past war aims were not to replace one form of totalitarianism with another. America intends to extend its protective forces overseas to oppose such a replacement and establish outposts against its intrusion into what America considers its own world. In the coming years, disputes may arise frequently, but the most pressing effect of this policy is to reduce the possibility of actual war.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] If President Truman's policy of aiding free nations is expanded, then Korea and Hungary will be at the forefront of the candidate list. Some government officials are already drafting plans to aid the two countries. The plight of each country is, at least in part, the result of Soviet pressure, similar to the situations in Greece and Turkey. Judging from the United States' foreign aid since Victory Day, it can be seen that if the policy President Truman revealed to Congress is implemented worldwide, it may later include China and Italy. However, whether other countries in the democratic front can ultimately request American aid remains to be determined.</p>
<h3>Senate Begins Foreign Policy Debate</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] The Senate debated foreign policy vigorously tonight. Republican Senator Brooks stated that the United States had provided billions of dollars in Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union during the war, and now it must "fight it." President Truman yesterday requested $400 million to aid Greece and Turkey to stop the expansion of Soviet influence. We now regret not having allowed the German army to annex the Soviet Union. If we had not helped the Soviet Union at that time, there would be no threat of world communism today. We must start anew. The first step is to send military advisors, the second step is to send troops and tanks, and the third step is war.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] Republican Senator Brooks commented on the President's speech: "I want the government to explain what is the difference between the Chinese Communists and the Greek Communists." Congressman O'Connors said: "If we want to stop communism, why not stop domestic communism first? Why not stop communism in South America? Why not help Spain expel its communists? There are opportunities to stop communism in all of these places, but expelling the communists from Greece is not possible."</p>
<h3>Purging Nazis in Germany: Four Foreign Ministers Engage in Heated Debate, USSR Agrees to Allow Smaller Nations to Participate in Discussions on German Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: The four foreign undersecretaries and military experts resumed preparatory work on the German-Austrian peace treaty at 11 o'clock this morning. The four major powers' foreign ministers held their fifth meeting at 4 pm (Moscow time).</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 13th] The four foreign ministers, in their discussion of the Austrian peace treaty, have agreed that in the future, any Austrian military officers who served in Hitler's army may not hold ranks above colonel.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Moscow, 14th Broadcast: The Soviet Union has agreed in principle to allow smaller allied nations to participate in discussions on the German peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 13th] The four foreign ministers held their fourth meeting today, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. US Secretary of State Marshall proposed a suggestion requiring the Allied nations to adopt a unified policy on purging Nazis in Germany. He stated that the United States has now learned that the Soviet Union is not vetting Nazis who have joined the German Communist Socialist Unity Party. The US government is opposed to using the purge of Nazis as a political tool to support any German political party. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also echoed Marshall's position that the Allied nations must unify their policy on purging Nazis. Marshall also pointed out that Nazis in the American occupation zone are not allowed to participate in political party activities, while there are incidents of active Nazis in the Soviet occupation zone participating in the Socialist Unity Party. Marshall immediately requested that the Allied Control Council in Berlin be instructed to order the German authorities to unify laws to guarantee "equality and fairness" for the German people. Finally, Molotov and Bevin both agreed to this. However, Molotov replied that he was not aware of any incidents of Nazis being recruited into the Socialist Unity Party, but that the Soviet occupation zone had purged 390,470 people, while the purging work in other occupation zones was extremely poor. Molotov requested in the meeting that comprehensive labor unions be organized in Germany, regardless of occupation zone boundaries, and requested that the land reform plan that has already been implemented in the Soviet occupation zone also be implemented in the Western occupation zones. He said that after unifying the occupation zone governments, discussions on the future organization of the German government can avoid certain debates, such as the fact that the government currently organized in the American occupation zone is federal in nature, while the Soviet occupation zone is a centralized government. Based on impressions gained, Marshall and Bevin were unsuccessful in bringing general principles up for discussion. The fifth meeting tomorrow will continue to discuss the issue of purging Nazis.</p>
<h3>Churchill Praises Truman's Speech</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: Churchill delivered a speech at the Conservative Party meeting, praising President Truman's new foreign policy, saying: "Among the various steps taken by the United States to maintain world peace and freedom, I know of none so strong and powerful, giving more opportunities. If the United States had taken this step before the last world war, it could have prevented its occurrence. If this step had been taken after the First World War, it could have been prevented even more. If this step had been taken before 1914, world peace could have been maintained, and we all would have lived in a happier world. I am sure that public opinion in our country will welcome this great decision by the United States. This is our obligation. I dare say that our policy is like America's policy of friendship with the Soviet Union, but this is a strong policy of friendship, not a weak policy of appeasement."</p>
<h3>US House Appropriations Committee Opposes Shipping Oil Refining Equipment to USSR, Considering Such Action as Seeking Appeasement of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber today rejected the State Department's application to allow the shipment of $25 million worth of oil refining equipment to the Soviet Union. He said, "We cannot take this action. This action is tantamount to seeking to appease the Soviet Union." This equipment was originally intended to be shipped to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease agreement, but it was not implemented before the end of last year. In 1946, it was stipulated that the use of public funds for shipping would be prohibited from December 31. The State Department's request had already been rejected by the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<h3>Izvestia Attacks</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: The Soviet government's official newspaper "Izvestia" today fiercely attacked Truman, saying that "Truman is the second Hitler, and his true purpose is to annex Greece and Turkey."</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 13th] The first reaction in the Soviet Union to President Truman's speech was to compare the United States with Germany during the era of Nazi territorial expansion. An editorial in "Izvestia" accused the United States of attempting to subject Greece and Turkey to its imperialist expansion plans. The newspaper mocked Truman's call to save Greece and Turkey from Bolshevism, saying it was not something new. "When Hitler wanted to open up his path of aggression, he also spoke madly of the Bolsheviks." This heated editorial appeared on the fifth day of the Foreign Ministers Conference, just as the Foreign Ministers Conference was deadlocked in a general debate on the German issue. Due to Truman's provocative speech and its broad implications, the entire future is bleak.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Koo's Speech: Hopes Democratic Countries will Cooperate to Jointly Guarantee Lasting Peace</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Charlottesville, Virginia, 14th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin delivered a speech to students at the University of Virginia last night, saying that to guarantee lasting peace, the world's democratic countries must take united action, and there is no doubt that democracy will ultimately prevail. However, the immediate priority is to complete effective cooperation and successfully conclude agreements with enemy countries before it can be effective.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Views</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 13th] Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace gave a radio address today, commenting on President Truman's proposal to loan money to Greece and Turkey, believing that it would push the whole world closer to war. He said: "What we are encountering is not a Greek crisis, but an American crisis. As an American citizen, I oppose giving loans to Turkey, which is neither democratic nor food-sufficient. I oppose giving loans to Greece until a national Greek government is established and ensures that American loans are used for the welfare of the Greek people." Wallace believes that Truman's plan will worsen America's relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Truman's Health Better Than Before, Reading Novels for Leisure</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: President Truman is resting in Key West, Florida. It rained suddenly today, so he stayed indoors, reading novels for leisure. According to White House Press Secretary Ross, "The President's health is better than before." Regarding the world's reaction to his speech, Mr. Truman has only heard a little about it, but his staff frequently communicates with Acheson at the State Department and Marshall in Moscow by telephone. It is said that Mr. Truman is ready to fly back to Washington at any time if necessary.</p>

<h3>Compromise Plan on Japanese Reparations: It is Reported that MacArthur has Submitted it to Washington</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 14th] According to semi-official sources today, MacArthur has submitted to Washington a compromise plan on Japanese reparations, with a total value approximately equal to the average of that stipulated in the Pauley Plan and that proposed by the visiting committee in February. It is said that if the current "temporary" reparations plan can be passed, the above-mentioned standard will be achieved. The source also said that Pauley's plan was too harsh and may not be feasible. Conversely, the committee organized by American engineers completely ignored the political significance of reparations. Experts at the Allied General Headquarters hope that this "temporary" plan will be approved by the Far Eastern Commission without further delay or modification. For the sake of Japan's economic recovery, MacArthur also hopes that it will proceed quickly. The plan was submitted to Washington two weeks ago.</p>

<h3>Plane Returning from Guangzhou Crashes Over Zhabei: Flying Fortress Destroyed, Seven on Board Perish, Shantytown Collapses, Mother and Daughter Die Tragically</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A B-24 four-engine bomber (i.e., Flying Fortress) belonging to the Eighth Air Group stationed at the Datong Airport in this city crashed over Zhabei yesterday at 5:15 PM while flying back from Guangzhou. It was destroyed in Zhongshan Road and Tai Road, Yintang Residence, and caught fire. All seven people on board were air force personnel who died in the crash. At the same time, it also crushed a shantytown household, killing a mother and daughter inside.</p>
<p>The plane arrived near this city at around 4:30 PM yesterday, circling over Datong and Zhabei for several weeks, flying extremely low. At 5:15 PM, residents near the area suddenly heard a strange noise and saw the plane crash vertically from the sky, accidentally crushing a Guan family shantytown household, and immediately catching fire. Two people from the plane were thrown out. At that time, many policemen from the fourth squad of the 24th division were on the scene and rushed to rescue. They dragged one person out of the plane, but they were already dead. Subsequently, an explosion occurred in the plane, and machine gun bullets flew out. The Yichang and Zhabei fire brigades dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire, but because the gasoline was on fire, it was difficult to extinguish for a while. When reporters left at around 9:00 PM, there was still residual fire. The nose, wings, and body of the plane were fragmented, scattered all over the ground. Only the tail was intact, with the tail numbers 4424462 and B24002. Luggage, canned food, radio transceivers, machine guns, and other miscellaneous items were scattered around the plane's body.</p>
<p>The Guan family shantytown's head was Guan Yemao, who had two brothers, Yeqing and Yeliu, who were farmers from Yancheng. When the plane crashed, only Guan Yemao's wife and daughter Fahua were in the house. Because they could not escape in time, they were buried in the fire. Guan Yeliu and another resident, Guan Caigui, were injured by flying fragments from the plane and were sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Jiaozhou Road, Xinzha Road, by the fire police. It is understood that because the injuries were minor, they were discharged from the hospital late at night after bandaging. Liang Kanghou, the third section chief of the Eighth Air Group, visited Zhang Youquan, the director of the Datong Police Sub-bureau, to discuss the aftermath. Director Zhang agreed to send police officers to guard the accident site all night to prohibit the movement of any parts removed from the plane to investigate the cause of the accident. It is also learned that among the three bodies of the personnel on board that have been recovered, one is Qu Bingjun, 30 years old. The other surnames are unknown. (Attached pictures: The top picture shows the moment when the plane crashed and caught fire, taken by Jiekang. The bottom picture shows the situation when firefighters arrived to put out the fire, taken by this newspaper.)</p>
<h3>Plane Ticket Price Increase Approved: New Price List Expected to Arrive Today from Nanjing; China Airlines Actively Rectifies Internally to Ensure Safety</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the person in charge of China Airlines, the adjustment of ticket prices has been approved by the Ministry of Communications, but the exact amount has not yet been announced. The company received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications yesterday stating that the new price list will arrive in Shanghai today. All international and domestic routes will be restored in compliance with the order starting tomorrow. Departures starting tomorrow include several flights from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and from Peiping to Taiyuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the suspension of flights for more than a month, the company has actively rectified internally. All C47 military transport aircraft, due to outdated equipment, have been completely abandoned and replaced with DC4 four-engine giant aircraft. A centralized control system has been adopted, with the airport in this city taking charge. Before any aircraft departs from any location, it must first contact Shanghai, report the weather forecast, and await instructions. After the implementation of this system, it is believed that future flights will be safer.</p>
<p>[Another report] Passenger planes will resume flying tomorrow, and yesterday many people went to the two airlines to register for tickets. Those who registered before and after the suspension of flights are still valid, but most of them have changed to other means of transportation to leave Shanghai. Those who still want to fly can board in priority according to the order.</p>

After the judge finished the interrogation, he was ordered to be detained.</p>
<p>According to Zhan Liansheng to reporters: There are many companies undertaking the Central Bank's sale of gold, how can I manipulate it alone? In a few days, the truth will come out. The local court has decided to form a collegial panel for the trial, and the court president has appointed Chief Judge Wu Xiangzu as the presiding judge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, after being released on bail the night before last, originally planned to go to Beijing by night train, but did not go due to other reasons. Yesterday, they still went to the Central Bank to work, and their movements were still under the surveillance of the Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Evidence of Three Crimes and Case Files Simultaneously Sent to Court</h3>
<p>The crimes of Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng are the same case. Therefore, although Lin and Yang were temporarily allowed to be released on bail to handle the handover, their case files have been transferred to the Local Court at the same time as Zhan Liansheng. It is reported that the evidence of the crime announced by the Garrison Headquarters is part of the evidence that the three criminals could not destroy. Those that may have been destroyed are still transferred to the court. During the investigation of the gold rush, the Economic Supervisory Group could only conduct a general investigation due to certain objective reasons. If further development is sought based on this outline, there are still many clues to be found. After the case is transferred to the court, this work will be done by the court.</p>

<h3>Retrial of Tang Shoumin, Ruddy Complexion and Calm Demeanor, Claiming to Have Been Forced to Serve in Puppet Positions, Providing Intelligence and Witnesses</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Tang Shoumin, a giant in Shanghai's financial circles during the enemy and puppet period, was accused of serving as the chairman of the "Business Association" and other puppet positions and suspected of being a traitor. The High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment on May 30 last year. Tang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court overturned the verdict and sent it back for retrial on September 21 last year. The case reopened for investigation at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Tang was wearing a deep blue silk cotton robe, with a ruddy complexion and calm demeanor. He argued: He was the general manager of the Bank of Communications before the war. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out in 1937, he followed the government to Hankou and was later ordered to go to Hong Kong to reorganize the business of the Bank of Communications. After the fall of Hong Kong, he planned to escape back to Chongqing from Kowloon, but was unfortunately arrested by the enemy military police and escorted to Shanghai. Wang Jingwei wanted me to be the Minister of Industry and Commerce, but I refused. Because I originally worked at the Bank of Communications, in order to preserve the property of the bank, I took the position of Chairman of the Bank of Communications. After the victory, all the cash of the Bank of Communications was handed over, and not a single gold bar was moved. There is a certificate from the Bank of Communications to prove this. The Puppet Commercial Control Committee was convened by Zhou Fohai and Mei Shiping at a tea party for representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai, and the organization of the "Commercial Control Committee" was announced on the spot, and I was elected as the chairman. It was impossible to refuse under the circumstances at the time. During his tenure in the puppet position, the puppet government entrusted him to purchase more than 127,000 pieces of yarn, some of which were distributed to Shanghai citizens, one zhang and five chi per person, regardless of gender or age. The rest were stored in the treasury and handed over after the victory. In addition, he provided economic intelligence to the Central Government, which was forwarded by Yuan Liang. Zhang Ziqi, the current Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, and Dai Juesheng, an official of the Military Statistics Bureau, can all prove this. Regarding his service as a counselor of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and a member of the Puppet National Economic Committee, he argued that they were all empty titles and he had never been there. Lawyers Lu Shidao and Jiang Rong stood up to defend him. The court ordered that further investigation was needed and adjourned the trial.</p>

The Concession has no such title as a private secretary, and there is a letter of appointment to prove it. He worked in the same office as He Dekui, the current Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government. The foreign affairs consultant is an empty title and did not do anything. There is no materials control bureau in the Concession, only a materials control office, and I have not worked in it. He has not opened a company and has never been interested in business.

<h3>U.S. Aid to China Association Assists University Professors in China: Establishes Scholarships for Further Study in the U.S. with 30 Places at US$4,000 Each</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] The United China Relief, whose mission is to promote Sino-American cultural exchange, has established scholarships for university professors and researchers to pursue advanced studies in the United States this year. The detailed measures have been drafted and are published below:</p>
<p>(1) The United China Relief's objectives in establishing scholarships for professors and researchers to pursue advanced studies in the United States are threefold: (1) to enhance teaching and research work, to assist Chinese scholars from domestic universities, independent colleges, and research institutions to study in the United States for one year within the association's designated academic fields, to conduct research, investigation, or other academic and cultural work; (2) to promote the construction of China and the training of construction talents, with long-term beneficial impact; (3) to increase Americans' understanding of China through visits to the United States by Chinese scholars.</p>
<p>Scholarship Quota</p>
<p>(2) The scholarship quota is tentatively set at around 30, with the exact number depending on the number of applicants who meet excellent conditions and changes in the association's financial situation. If necessary, selection can be done in batches, sending people abroad in sequence. (3) The scholarship amount is tentatively set at US$4,000 per person, for the following purposes: (1) round-trip travel expenses from China to San Francisco: US$1,000; (2) living expenses in the United States: US$200 per month, totaling US$2,400; (3) travel expenses, health insurance, and contingency expenses in the United States: US$600.</p>
<p>Scope of Study</p>
<p>(4) The scope of study is limited to the following disciplines: (1) social sciences (including law and commerce); (2) natural sciences; (3) agricultural science; (4) engineering; (5) education and psychology (including home economics and physical education). (5) Scholarships should be awarded based on the following principles: (1) the applicant with the best qualifications within the designated academic fields should be selected; (2) priority should be given to applicants whose field of study is directly and significantly related to China's material or social construction; (3) priority should be given to applicants whose field of study has few opportunities for advanced study in domestic public or private institutions; (4) priority should be given to applicants whose field of study lacks advanced study equipment in China but has superior conditions in the United States. (6) The allocation of scholarship places among academic institutions should be based on the following principles: (1) institutions with a larger number of professors or senior researchers should have more opportunities to receive scholarship places; (2) institutions whose personnel have received many scholarships for advanced study from any institution in the past six years should have fewer opportunities to receive scholarship places under this measure; (3) due to the association's financial resources, special consideration should be given to the needs of private universities, independent colleges, and research institutions in the allocation of scholarship places.</p>
<p>Application Conditions</p>
<p>(7) Applicants must meet all of the following conditions: (1) full professors of public or private universities or independent colleges whose qualifications have been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education, or full professors who have not yet been reviewed, or senior researchers of research institutions who meet the qualifications of professors according to the standards of the Ministry of Education (associate professors of universities and independent colleges, and full or associate professors of vocational schools are not eligible for this measure); (2) having outstanding teaching or research achievements within the association's designated academic fields; (3) not having traveled to any foreign country for any reason in the past six years (excluding Hong Kong and Macau); (4) having a practical plan for advanced study that can make good use of the one year in the United States (one copy each in Chinese and English); (5) having sufficient English language skills to ensure the smooth implementation of the study plan in the United States; (6) having a certificate from an academic institution that the applicant will be rehired or initially hired after completing the study period and returning to China; (7) having passed a physical examination by a physician recognized by the association (the initial physical examination is conducted by the physician of the applicant's service institution; if there is no such physician, it is conducted by the physician of the local public health institution. The association may designate a physician for re-examination if necessary.); (8) being recommended by the supervisor of the applicant's service institution. Among applicants who meet all the above conditions, the winners will be selected based on the degree of excellence in items 2 and 4. Factors such as gender, age, marital status, religious belief, and political party affiliation, the number of consecutive years of service in an institution, and the number of years as a full professor are irrelevant to the selection criteria. (8) Personnel who can apply for scholarships from other parts of the association or cooperating institutions (such as the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, the Chinese Mass Education Movement, and the association's Child Welfare Committee) or members of the association's University Professor and Researcher Scholarship Committee are not eligible to apply. (9) If an applicant has family members who need their support and is willing to continue serving at the original institution after completing the study period and returning to China, and the original institution is also willing to rehire them, the supervisor of the service institution must state in writing in the recommendation letter: if the applicant is selected, their original position should have salary and allowances, which will be paid to their family as usual during their study abroad. Otherwise, the recommendation application will be invalid. Public colleges and universities must submit a request to the Ministry of Education for approval before paying the salary and allowances of the original position, and notify the association after the applicant is selected and before the scholarship recipient receives the travel expenses for going abroad.</p>
<p>Selection Procedures</p>

<h3>Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team Departs for Hong Kong Today in Batches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Star Table Tennis Team, which was assembled by Mr. Qu Yaokang with the best table tennis players in this city, was originally scheduled to go to the United States last winter. Secretary Situ Tong was sent to the United States to negotiate, but because the American table tennis season had passed and the出国护照 could not be processed in time, the team could not depart. Recently, a telegram came from the American Youth Federation, inviting the team to compete in the United States. Situ Tong also reported in a letter that 24 major cities in the United States welcomed the team to compete. The team leader Qu ran around to obtain assistance from Mayor Wu, and reported to the Sports Association Table Tennis Committee for record, and requested the Ministry of Education to transfer the 领出国护照. As soon as the letter of invitation from the American Youth Federation arrives, the team can set off.</p>
<p>Because of the relationship with the American expedition, the Shanghai Star Team strived to increase its strength and have more opportunities for mutual improvement. Therefore, it decided to go to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao first. Team leader Qu went to Hong Kong on the 6th of this month to negotiate. Now the team has received a telegram saying: "The Hong Kong team is going to Macau for the inter-city competition, and will return to Hong Kong on the 16th with Macau at the same time to face the Shanghai Star Team."

<h3>Changchun Northern Youth Basketball Team Triumphs in Tianjin: Defeats China Textile Team 1 in First Game</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tianjin Shipping News] After the Changchun Northern Youth Basketball Team arrived in Tianjin, it began to meet with the Tianjin team on the 9th. At 3:30 p.m., it played against China Textile Team 1 at the Yaohua Gymnasium, with Li Youzhen and Yao Enhan as referees. The audience was quite enthusiastic. 松北 refugees received more than 900,000 yuan in relief funds on the first day. If the plan for the Beijing team to come to Tianjin can be realized, the harvest will be even more considerable. Therefore, the Northern Youth team can be said to have made a worthwhile trip.</p>
<p>China Textile Takes the Lead</p>
<p>After the silver whistle sounded, each team showed their skills. The Northern Youth athletes were mostly tall and strong, but because they were unfamiliar with the place and the lineup was a little disorganized, they were taken advantage of by China Team 1. China Textile team has national players Li Shaotang and Li Yaohui, Pang Yanlin, etc., and their morale is very high. They took the lead in the fierce battle, scoring and leading. The Northern Youth was not willing to show weakness, and Ma Qingpu also repeatedly scored, but because the morale was in chaos, only two of the ten free throw opportunities were scored, resulting in a failure in the first half with a score of 16-22.</p>
<p>Northern Youth Takes the Lead</p>
<p>After changing sides, the Northern Youth changed its strategy, which was quite effective. China Textile's offense and defense were balanced, and they always led by one goal. Although the Northern Youth once created a tie with 33 points, the defense was sometimes taken advantage of, and they fell behind again. The China Textile team was eager to win, and often committed fouls. Li Shaotang was even sent off the field. At this point, there were no generals in Sichuan, and the overall situation was gone. In the last six minutes, the Northern Youth went straight in, and the scores of Tian Fuhai and Xu Yongji increased sharply. Although China Textile had Pang and Li and others trying to turn the tide, time was up, and the second half ended with a regretful truce at 21-32. The overall result was 48-43, and the Northern Youth took the lead by five points. The second game against Tianjin Electric will still be held at Yaohua on the evening of the 10th.</p>

<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang to Shanghai to Handle Current Price Issues: In addition to Yarn and Cloth and Coal Determined by Special Management Agencies, the Price Review Committee Will Be Expanded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu arrived in Shanghai last night by the Beijing-Shanghai train and arrived yesterday morning. According to Wang, he will stay in Shanghai for a considerable period. The main task is to deal with the current price issues based on the government's new economic plan. During his stay in Shanghai, he will consult with relevant parties separately in order to establish a standard price system for various major daily necessities. It has now been decided that the prices of various public and transportation utilities will not be increased. As for the amount of their losses, a subsidy system will be adopted. The principles of its implementation are currently under discussion.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the 28th regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held in the City Hall conference room. Those present included Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, Director of the Textile Control Committee Wu, Deputy Director Li, Committee Members Shu Yunchang, Yang Xiren, Wang Yangxian, Wu Weijing, Rong Hongyuan, Shao Yixin, Gu Xinghai, and Liu Wenteng, Wang Zijian, and others. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, Minister Wang first announced the government's intention to stabilize prices in the new economic plan. Wang continued: the review of the prices of various major commodities such as rice, yarn and cloth will be determined by the Textile Control Committee, and coal will be determined by the Fuel Control Committee. In addition, Shanghai will expand the organization of a price review committee. Major daily necessities, such as rice, flour, cooking oil, sugar, and salt, will be reviewed by the committee. All relevant parties will participate in this meeting. The various prices will be reviewed in accordance with the principles set by the new economic plan. The reviewed prices will be submitted to the Price Committee and the National Economic Commission for approval before implementation. Then the agenda was discussed, one was the issue of foreign cotton, and the other was the discussion of the purchase price in March. The foreign cotton issue has been partially resolved after discussion. Based on the statistics of the cotton inventory and operating spindles of various factories, it was believed that 368,000 bales of foreign cotton were needed this season. The foreign cotton quota for this season is US$10 million, which can only purchase 230,000 bales. If calculated at the current exchange rate, it is still not possible to purchase this amount. The deficit of 138,000 bales will be subsidized by the cotton shipped by UNRRA. UNRRA has already arrived with 30,000 bales, which will be used to offset it first. The remaining 100,000 bales are also about to arrive. Regarding the discussion of the purchase price in March, it was decided that the price negotiation sub-committee of the cotton spinning association in the six districts will conduct a preliminary review. After the price is negotiated, it will be submitted to the Textile Control Committee for approval at a special meeting next Monday, and then Minister Wang will take it to Nanjing for approval at the Price Committee meeting next Tuesday.</p>

<h3>Jewelry Industry Representatives Go to Beijing Again to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] The Shanghai Gold Jewelry Industry Association and representatives of gold jewelry industry associations from all over the country, with the members having suspended business for nearly a month, and more than a dozen "changing careers" or dissolving, and the government's failure to announce the revised regulations on jewelry, decided to go to Beijing again tomorrow to petition the Third Plenary Session and the Executive Yuan. Although the number of local representatives petitioning in Beijing this time has decreased, the number of units has increased. Recently, the number of representatives arriving in Shanghai from various places has been increasing daily. According to Yao Lianfang, if the jewelry industry resumes business, a joint association of gold jewelry industry associations across the country may be organized. He added that if the government does not allocate gold for sale, it should at least allow free purchase and sale, so that business can continue.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks continued their downward trend yesterday. Securities firms' sentiment weakened, and the number of buyers dwindled significantly. Ewo Yuen spun cotton opened at 19,600 yuan, gradually declining to 18,400 yuan after reaching 19,700 yuan. The market stabilized slightly at midday, with only sideways movement in the afternoon, lacking any distinct characteristics. As a result, compared to the previous closing, British United Ewo Yuen spun cotton and paper shares experienced a decline of over 5%, shipping shares fell by 10%, while the remaining stocks saw minor setbacks.</p>
<h3>Medium and Lower Grades of Japonica Rice Rise Slightly; Barrelled Raw Oil Rebounds by 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw approximately 15,000 shih (石, a unit of dry measure) arrive from both northern and southern regions. Medium and lower grades of japonica rice rose slightly by 1,000 yuan, while higher grades remained stable. However, due to abundant river reserves, the market's closing weakened, indicating a lack of momentum for further price increases. For indica rice, prices in production areas remained high, with strong market sentiment and a price increase of 1,000 yuan. White and Yin Yuan (currency names) remained sluggish and inactive. Flour arrivals continued steadily, but demand was weak, leading to a decline of 1,000 yuan. Bran transactions were sparse, with a continued bearish outlook. Soybean cakes experienced sluggish sales, with tight conditions in the morning but weak conditions in the afternoon, resulting in a flat outcome.</p>
<p>In the oil market, stores still had strong demand for raw oil. Barrelled raw oil rebounded by 10,000 yuan, and distilled raw oil also increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. However, soybean oil showed little dynamism due to arrivals in Qingdao, Hankou, and Tianjin. Rapeseed oil and clear oil remained unaffected by gains or losses.</p>
<p>Soybeans trended weaker, with cylinder beans falling by a small 1,000 yuan, and red beans also dropping by 1,000 yuan. Sesame remained strong. Peanut kernels experienced weak demand from outside ports, with normal sales locally, leading to a gradual decline of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn saw minimal demand from northern ports, leading to desperate price cutting. Red sorghum continued to decline, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Broad beans remained in a state of fluctuation, while soybeans faced sluggish sales, showing a weakening trend.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Changes in the US Dollar Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the market was rife with rumors that the Central Bank would change the US dollar exchange rate to 8,000 yuan, with some saying it would be 10,000 yuan. As soon as the rumors started, the prices of Chinese stocks began to fall. Other general commodity prices also trended downward. The general belief in the market was that the recent personnel changes at the Central Bank were to coordinate with the government's new economic plan, and that policy improvements were certain. Another rumor was that a large amount of legal tender would be withdrawn and no longer issued, so people were optimistic about the legal tender. This reporter immediately inquired with a responsible person at the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Department about the change in the exchange rate. They said that they had not heard of such a thing, and that everything would have to wait until Director-General Zhang returned to the bank before there would be any clues.</p>
<p>According to a certain observer, the exchange rate between China and the United States was revised not long ago. Given the current state of China's currency, it would be ideal to first seek long-term stability at a certain level. Repeated revisions, whether lengthening or shortening, are not appropriate. Therefore, they believe the government will not arbitrarily change the exchange rate.</p>
<h3>State-Run Enterprises to Be Returned to Private Management; Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow for Discussion</h3>

It is now learned that the Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, has scheduled another meeting in this city on the 16th to further discuss the plan for returning enterprises to private management, so as to decide on implementation strategies.</p>
<h3>Sellers Dominate Chinese Stock Market; Secondary Popular Stocks and Miscellaneous Stocks Fall to Daily Limits</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued their downward trend yesterday, but due to loose monetary conditions, there was considerable fluctuation in the middle. Large investors were automatically reducing their holdings in both long and short positions, and transaction volume decreased. Many secondary popular stocks and miscellaneous stocks fell to their daily limits.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>Stable. Di Yong spun cotton opened, with numbers 198, 185, 83, 68, 199, 129, and 226 all rising and once recovering to 3,200 yuan.

The 3,000-yuan level was broken, and Di Yong spun cotton was forced down to 2,850 yuan. Numbers 180, 231, 14, 177, and 12, etc., made up the losses, and the market closed at 2,900 yuan outside of the midday closing.

After 3 o'clock, due to an unimportant announcement in the market, rumors suddenly spread that special certificates had been cancelled, sparking a buying frenzy. Many blindly followed, driving Di Yong spun cotton up to around 2,950 yuan. Ultimately, this unfounded buying could not last.

<h3>Remittances from Overseas Chinese Through Postal Remittance Bureau Increase in Legal Tender Amount</h3>
<p>According to Secretary Zhang of the Overseas Chinese Remittance Group of the Postal Remittance Bureau, the agencies handling remittances from Overseas Chinese in China include the Bank of China, the Postal Savings Bureau, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and the Guangdong Bank. The bureau's remittance business focuses on the United States and the South Seas Islands (including Singapore, Java, and over twenty other places). The remittance situation was good last autumn, but the high black market exchange rate in Hong Kong had a great impact on our remittance business. Remittances in January of this year amounted to 1.1 billion yuan in legal tender (of which 200 million yuan was from the United States, and the rest was from the South Seas Islands, with the most remittances coming from Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Penang, and three other cities). Since the recent announcement of emergency economic measures and the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, remittances from Overseas Chinese through the bureau to the motherland have reached a total of 1.4 billion yuan in legal tender as of last week.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Rayon continued to decline due to a complete lack of actual sales. Yesterday, the market fell by another 200,000 yuan. Number 120, Gaoshan Youguang, opened weakly, calling for 450,000 yuan, but no one inquired. The market closed at 400,000 yuan without any transactions. In the afternoon, the price remained between 350,000 and 400,000 yuan. Factory agents also saw no transactions yesterday, with asking prices slightly lower than the previous day. Some were willing to sell D-grade user silk for 7.2 million yuan, but there were no buyers. Silk fabrics generally did not change their asking prices. Although raw materials had fallen, factory prices were insufficient to cover costs, so they all held firm, and transactions were extremely rare.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Association of Six Districts to Review Purchase Prices</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The price negotiation subcommittee of the Cotton Textile Association of Six Districts is scheduled to hold a meeting at 10 a.m. today at the conference room of the Textile Construction Company on Jiangxi Road. Members of the association, including Wu Weijing, Tong Runfu, Liu Jingji, Chen Jintang, and Jiang Dixian, will all attend. In addition to reviewing the purchase price for March, the factory price for free trade of private factories will also be reviewed, and the maximum price will be stipulated. At the same time, the committee will discuss whether to supplement the purchase price for February.</p>
<p>Regarding the 40 million US dollars in foreign exchange required for the foreign cotton quota, negotiations will be conducted for prompt approval after President Zhang of the Central Bank returns to Shanghai from Beijing today.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Asking Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw limited supply of fine cloth from the Textile Construction Company, while dyeing factories continued to demand it, leading to depletion of spot chips. Market sentiment was positive, and asking prices increased. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth prices rose to 160,000 yuan, an increase of 1,500 yuan from the previous day. Blue Chicken was 146,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Zhenzhong was 135,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. Other brands also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. For raw-colored cloth and drill, demand from native merchants was quite strong due to the upcoming milder weather, leading to more brisk prices. Customers from Tianjin made large purchases. Four Gentlemen Golden Seal drill initially opened at 149,500 yuan, gradually rising to 152,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan. 405 Sheep fine twill was 137,500 yuan, up 7,500 yuan. Other goods were also firm.</p>
<h3>Continued Allocation of Cooking Oil for the Third Week: 250,000 Yuan per Shih</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Cooking Oil Joint Allocation Office continued the allocation of cooking oil for the third week starting yesterday, totaling 3,000 dan (担, a unit of weight) of soybean oil and 600 zu (祖, a unit of measurement) of rapeseed oil. The allocated area is south of the Suzhou River (including Nanshi and Huxi, with "Zhong", "Xi", and "Nan" on the allocation certificates). The payment dates are the 14th and 15th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. The allocation quantity is one barrel (360 shih jin, 市斤, a unit of weight) per household.

<h3>Large Batch of Flour Arrives at Port</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The "Torifiqi" (transliteration), manager of the overseas department of Jardine Matheson, brought in over 264,000 bags of flour from Vancouver, as well as 140 large pine logs and dry wood pulp. The ship is currently unloading at buoys No. 1 and No. 2. These goods were purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. In addition, the "Smola Victory" of the Great American Company also arrived yesterday, carrying 1,600 tons of goods, as well as 1,700 bales of cotton and miscellaneous goods, totaling about 7,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Hankou Tung Oil Floods In; 400 Tons Arrived at the Wharf Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Tung oil from Hankou has been continuously arriving for the past two weeks, with a total of approximately 2,800 tons having arrived. Yesterday (the 14th), 400 tons arrived and were being unloaded at the wharf. The purchase price for merchants in Shanghai yesterday was 390,000 yuan per dan for standard oil, and 420,000 yuan per dan for retail. The export price for standard oil was 430,000 yuan, and 440,000 yuan with the barrel. The price of "Fu Xi Hong" (a brand of tung oil) was 370,000 yuan per barrel. It is estimated that the large quantity of tung oil arriving from various sources is due to the attraction of high prices. Yesterday, the price of standard Hankou tung oil was 370,000 yuan per shih.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Spring Sales Launch</h3>
<p>Yesterday, large and small Western-style tailors and retail shops in this district, as well as customers from Hunan, North China, Hankou, Anqing, Xuzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, etc., all eagerly purchased woolen fabrics. The spring sales were launched, and buyers' appetite was strong. Yuan Changxing and other shops were crowded. In addition to light-colored goods selling well, palice, wandaline, feather yarn, and Xia cloth were also sold in large quantities. Other items such as lining cloths, mercerized feather yarn, French lining, sleeve linings, foreign cloth, gray soft lining, rainproof cloth, white canvas, and hemp glue cloth also saw brisk transactions.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Soybeans Arrive in Shanghai; 60 British Pounds per Ton</h3>
<p>According to sources in the import and export industry, Northeastern soybeans have always been one of China's important export commodities. The United Kingdom and other European countries have strong demand. It is learned that import and export firms here have already shipped goods to the port, with a selling price of 60 British pounds per ton, delivered on board in Shanghai. Based on current market prices, this seems quite profitable.</p>
<h3>This Year's Export Oil Quantities: Economic Department Allocation Finalized; Soybean Oil to Soviet Union Most, Tung Oil to United States Most</h3>

<h3>Export Promotion Committee Subcommittee Meetings to Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to Mr. Shen Xirui, Director of the Secretariat of the Export Promotion Committee, the future work direction of the Export Promotion Committee must wait until President Zhang returns to Shanghai before any decisions can be made. Of the 17 subcommittee meetings of the committee, three have already been established, and another three or four are planned to be established soon. The urgent export of straw hat braids aims to provide employment opportunities for straw hat braid producers in Wenzhou. The current election of 34 representatives by foreign merchants is unrelated to the Export Promotion Committee, and the method of future liaison with our committee still needs to be discussed.</p>
<h3>Qihong Tea Market Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although sellers' asking prices for red-edged tea specifically for domestic sales once increased, the market's strength ultimately remained unable to rise due to sluggish sales and continued to hover. Foreign firms continued to suppress the price of Qidou black tea, with transactions continuing to occur, mainly because those urgently seeking funds continued to sell. Although prices did not fall continuously, the situation generally softened. According to buyers, if sellers are willing to make further concessions, there will be more willingness to absorb the tea. As for various green teas, old and inferior goods that have been stored for many years remain difficult to sell. However, there is a constant stream of inquiries about the colors and varieties of 1945 and 1946. Unfortunately, the results of the discussion and negotiation between buyers and sellers lack smoothness, and the process is difficult to turn into a splendid situation, with the situation remaining firm as before.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchants Demand Yarn; Yarn Market Continues to Thrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to thrive, because Tianjin merchants still had a demand, and peers took advantage of the situation to buy, causing the prices of various counts of yarn to rise by another 100,000 yuan. 40-count single yarn was still in demand by weaving factories, and 42-count double-strand thread rose by 250,000 yuan. Although the prices of other counts followed suit and rose by 100,000 yuan, there were only asking prices, and buyers were still extremely scarce, making the foundation unstable.</p>
<h3>China Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Commission as usual, selling a total of 2,312 pieces. Domestic manufacturers accounted for 1,958 pieces, and yarn numbers accounted for 354 pieces. A total of 1,102 households applied, of which 757 were domestic manufacturers and 345 were yarn numbers.</p>
<h3>Reclassification of Import Tariffs Definitely Being Studied by Special Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited a responsible person at the quota allocation office of the Import and Export Control Committee and asked many questions, which they answered. They are recorded as follows: (1) Due to repeated requests from various parties to reclassify certain import tariffs, they have indeed been submitted to a special subcommittee to study the method of reclassification to meet the needs of reality. However, it is still awaiting submission to the authorities for approval before it can be published. (2) The qualification verification of importers of gasoline, diesel, etc., is based on 35% of each merchant's turnover in the three years before the war, 35% of the turnover in the one year after the war (1946), and 30% of each merchant's operating capacity, oil storage capacity, etc. Other imported goods each have their own standards, and they are not all the same. The allocation matters for oil merchants will be decided at another meeting today, and it will be completed. (3) The foreign cotton quota will not change. However, the allocation method may be considered for modification. (4) According to the situation before the war, the annual import volume of the goods listed in Appendix 2 accounted for 70% of the total import value of our country, and the current situation is similar. (5) The monthly allocation quota for newsprint is roughly 1,000 tons for newspapers in this city, 600 tons for newspapers in other cities, 550 tons for local party newspapers, and 1,500 tons for the book industry.</p>

<h3>On "Devil" and "Tao"</h3>
<p>— Ge Zhe Wu</p>
<p>Also Discussing "The Coffin Split Open," "Journey to the West," and "Pan Jinlian," etc.</p>
<p>"The Tao rises one foot, the devil rises ten," is the theoretical rule of Chinese orthodox thought. Therefore, what is called "Tao," we certainly know is "self-denial and restoration of propriety," but it is the result of "asceticism"! This result is naturally the opposite of "Tao" to the true nature of "humanity"! Because Tao also means rules and regulations, the manifestation and norm of human power, not the destination of free desire. It can become a correct theory in politics, but it is a subject worth resisting in artistic expression! The two major centers of artistic expression are sex and food! The sage also said, "Eating and sex are human nature." It can be seen that the highest expression of art is nothing more than the problem of love and bread!</p>
<p>Since love is one aspect of human nature, artistic expression often cannot escape this category. There have been many works throughout history, both ancient and modern, both Chinese and foreign, that take the entanglement and struggle between the desired "Tao" and "human nature" as their theme!</p>
<p>For example, I recently watched "The Coffin Split Open," which I had seen in my childhood. Orthodox theorists call it yellow culture, but after careful investigation, the theme of the play is nothing more than another expression of the theme of "Tao" and "Devil"! For example, Zhuang Zhou designed to test his wife, which is the foothold of "Tao" at work. And when Zhuang Zhou told her about "fanning the grave," his wife scolded him for being shameless, and said that she would never do such a thing in the future, which is another foothold of "Tao"! That is the norm of artificial society, not the desire of human nature itself! So later, Zhuang Zhou transformed into a young master to mourn. If it wasn't for the temptation of a handsome young man, if it were a pockmarked man or a blind man, she might not have been moved by his beauty! And the young master wanted to eat "human brains," a desire that was unreasonable. The woman initially did not seem to bear to do it, but the magic of the young master's cries aroused an all-consuming action. This is possible under the explanation of "sexual perversion psychology," which is the manifestation of "Devil" power overwhelming "Tao" practice! The writer of this play certainly intended to write about "the exploration of a woman's lust," but he did not fail to harbor the thought of resisting the one-sided chastity of "widowhood." It is a pity that he wrote it a little too viciously!</p>
<p>In the past, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian wrote "Pan Jinlian" to overturn the old case. He believed that Pan's love for Ximen Qing was the result of the perversion of not being able to love Wu Song. Today, Zui Lijun's long monologue at the end of "Wu Song" is the main line of the drama "Pan Jinlian" of that year. At that time, Mr. Hong Shen had judged it with the theory of abnormal psychology, and Ying praised Mr. Ouyang's "bold" work. In fact, in so-called demonic works of literature, the coloring of this kind of human nature is everywhere! "Salome" wanted to kiss the saint but could not, and as a result, she wanted the saint's "head." This is also the struggle between the devil and the tao, and it is also the satisfaction of sexual perversion psychology!</p>
<p>Similarly, in "Journey to the West," every monster wants to eat Tang Monk's flesh! This is also the struggle between the saint and the demon. The only difference is that each time Tang Monk encounters difficulties, he remains loyal, guards himself, and his Tao heart does not move, and finally he is saved! This kind of "emptiness" and "lust" is the theme of the Chinese "Legend of the White Snake"! In Japan, there is a play called "The Robber," which tells the story of a thief being deceived by a woman and finally arrested, and it also has the same meaning of "devil" overcoming "sincerity"!</p>
<p>As for another play called "Emptiness" and "Lust," the content is about a "high monk" who, after twenty years of Taoist cultivation, meets his mistress of twenty years on a journey. He tried his best to restrain himself, but he was finally made drunk by the woman, and his twenty years of Taoist practice were all abandoned! This is also a product of writing about the power of the devil overcoming the practice of Tao!</p>
<p>In short, the struggle between the devil and the tao often becomes a major theme in literature. As for whether the victory is written about the tao or the victory is written about the devil, there are different views. However, I believe that there is no sin in writing about direct love literature, but if it is rendered too fiery and promiscuous on the stage, it should not be allowed by "Tao," which is also the downward path of "humanity." Flowing into the river of depression and numbness is not what the future of mankind needs. Roughly speaking, the "yellow" of "yellow" culture refers to this meaning; however, as far as literature and art are concerned, it has its own "moral view," so there is no need to measure it with ordinary vulgar theories!</p>
<h3>Two Sides of Perfection</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>Mencius said, "Fish is what I desire; bear's paw is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will forgo the fish." Achieving both is indeed a difficult thing.</p>
<p>To write well and to be popular with readers is perhaps the same as trying to have both fish and bear's paw. Because anyone can understand: a good article may not be popular, and a popular article may not be good; although a good article can be popular, and a popular article can be good, these are ultimately rare exceptions. First, is there any absolute, objective standard of good writing? No. So, good writing itself has no reliable basis. Second, in today's world where "writing is valued by the person," there is even less of a standard for good writing. Often, what famous writers produce, even if it's just incoherent accounts, is treated as a masterpiece, while the carefully crafted works of the unknown rarely get published, lacking even the most basic luck. Therefore, what is called good writing may be bad writing! Whether an article is popular has nothing to do with its quality. The quality of writing and its popularity are two entirely separate matters, just as fish is fish and bear's paw is bear's paw.</p>
<p>If you understand this point, that writing cannot be perfect in both aspects, you can save yourself a lot of trouble. Anyone can set a goal and work towards it to achieve their wish. For example, if you only want to write well and don't care about popularity, then you will write according to your conscience and ability, creating what you believe is the best article, in both content and form, and it will be appreciated by the few who truly have the eye and know its worth. If you only want to be popular, then, to be honest, you don't need to worry about the quality of the article at all, and you don't need to take the difficult and unrewarding path of insisting on good writing. Just find a way to attract the reader's attention and win their favor, and you can succeed. In this way, everyone gets what they want: those who want good writing get good writing, and those who want popularity get popularity. Perhaps this is a true kind of two-sided perfection.</p>
<p>Only when things are divided into two can we talk about two-sided perfection. Combining things into one, trying to have it all, makes two-sided perfection impossible. This is what we should clearly understand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many who don't understand this principle and still desperately try to have both, ending up "like a hunchback falling, landing on neither end" and creating a lot of trouble. For example: thinking their own writing is good, they initially believe it will definitely be popular. When the result is not so, they try hard to find the reason. The result of their research will inevitably lead to two paths: one, to change direction, no longer being true to the writing itself, but only seeking popularity. Because they are not used to being popular, popularity remains unattainable, and their writing deteriorates; two, they inevitably blame heaven and earth, thinking that writing is ill-fated and has no way out. As for articles that were originally popular, if they suddenly try to improve and write something truly good, the result will also be a loss of popularity, and like a maidservant imitating a mistress, they end up being neither one thing nor the other, worthless, and feeling inevitably frustrated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are still many who don't understand this principle and are desperately flattering others: seeing someone else's good writing, they say it will definitely become popular and sought after. The author, hearing this, is initially flattered and overjoyed. After a while, unless they have realized that they cannot have both, they will either change their principles and drift with the world, or they will be full of complaints and sadness, becoming a disappointed and sorrowful person. Or, seeing someone's article is popular, they say it is definitely a masterpiece, which is why it has such success, not realizing that they have drawn a line in the dark, pushing that author out of the literary heaven, making it impossible for them to ever return. To be honest, I am not willing to flatter people in this way, to deceive people. I want to say: your writing is good, but it may not be popular; or: your popularity is a fact, but your writing may not be good. In short, you cannot have both.</p>
<p>I say this not to be extreme, deliberately speaking against the grain, or striking a high note. There are many things in this world that cannot be perfect in both aspects, not just writing, let alone fish and bear's paw!</p>
<p>The Bible says, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." This is the same principle. Otherwise, with one hand holding a wish-granting object and the other holding an abacus, those with cunning could greatly profit, gaining both fame and wealth, while those who are law-abiding and truly skilled would all be infuriated to death!…</p>
<p>Enough rambling, let's get back to writing. You should first recognize the principle that you cannot have both, and then decide which path you will take when you cannot have both! Once you have decided, go forward bravely and diligently, without regretting it. I wish you success!</p>

<h3>Reading "Remembering Sun Fulao"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Jianren</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Chunqiu Lumang's article "Remembering Sun Fulao" on March 1st is exactly when I am missing Sun Fulao. I often miss this kind old man. Fulao's spirit is still like that of a young man in his twenties, without any "old-fashionedness," unlike the current young writers who claim to be "old writers" to sell their age.</p>
<p>Since Sun Fulao went to Chengdu Qilu University to teach, I haven't seen him for more than half a year. Every time I went to the Sino-Foreign Publishing House on Meizhuan School Street, Shangqingsi, I went with a belly full of happiness, and always came back with disappointment. At that time, I lived in Jiangbei, and it was quite troublesome to go to the city, but every time I asked the gentleman at the publishing house, he always seemed to be joking with me:</p>
<p>"He just went to Chengdu yesterday!"</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>"He hasn't come yet!"</p>
<p>When I pressed him, he would say, "Come and see in a few days!" In the end, I was never able to meet him.</p>
<p>Last summer, I saw a news item in the Xinmin Evening News (Chongqing edition), knowing that Fulao had come to Chongqing from Chengdu, and I went to visit him in the city again the next day. That day, I went especially early. After shaking hands, Fulao said with a smile:</p>
<p>"How did you know I was coming?"</p>
<p>I told him that I had seen the news in the newspaper, and also told him that I had come more than five times, but never met him. That noon, we drank old wine and ate noodles in a restaurant on Meizhuan School Street. Later, I also told him that I would be returning east and that I was afraid it would be difficult to find a job, and that the cost of living in Shanghai was too high, and I was afraid I couldn't bear it. Fulao immediately picked up a pen, without the slightest reluctance, and wrote a letter of introduction for me to visit an authoritative literary journal editor in Shanghai. Fulao said:</p>
<p>"He will definitely find a way for you."</p>
<p>After returning east, due to economic pressure, I stayed in Shanghai for two days and returned to my hometown. To this day, Fulao's letter of introduction is still in my suitcase.</p>
<p>"I also hope that Fulao will do more research on Lu Xun, and introduce him to the youth of the new era with correct insights." I believe that Fulao is the one who has the most thorough understanding of Lu Xun.</p>
<p>Fulao likes to smoke, drink, and taste tea. He says:</p>
<p>"Without cigarettes, alcohol, and tea, you can't write an article; with cigarettes, alcohol, and tea, you may not be able to write an article."</p>
<p>I know that Fulao loves to eat "stir-fried eel paste" the most. Almost every time we eat, we have this dish.</p>
<p>When Fulao was editing the supplement of the Central Daily News in Hualongqiao, he went almost every day to the shop called "Qingyu Restaurant" on Hualongqiao Street to eat noodles, drink wine, and eat dishes. The sign of that shop was also written by Fulao. He said:</p>
<p>"This boss is a very good typical character and can be written into a novel."</p>
<p>I still can't write it to this day. At that time, I only felt that the boss's flattering energy was unbearable.</p>
<p>Sometimes I asked Fulao about his experience as the magistrate of Hengshan County. He smiled and said, "Not interesting."</p>
<p>"I still hope that Fulao will come out of the mountains and work for literature and art, and for the youth." Fulao said that he could return east in the spring! I hope that Fulao can return east in the spring, and still appear as a cultural warrior, giving up the life of teaching. Although I am too selfish. (February Hefei)</p>
<h3>The Secret of Love</h3>
<p>— RBurns Translated by Tianqin</p>
<p>I never told my love,</p>
<p>Love that never told can be;</p>
<p>For the gentle wind does move</p>
<p>Silently, invisibly.</p>
<p>I told my love, I told my love,</p>
<p>I told her all my heart</p>
<p>Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears.</p>
<p>Ah! She did depart!</p>
<p>Soon after she was gone from me,</p>
<p>A traveller came along,</p>
<p>Silently, invisibly:</p>
<p>He took her with a song.</p>
<h3>One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 198</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Roar...!" The fake "Commander Jin" indicated that she had figured things out, "So you two are here... really here...! Sorry, we can talk...!" After saying "sorry," she immediately turned around and yelled loudly at one of the two dung beetles behind her: "Send someone to tell the captain that this building is our own people, and all subordinates should resist in three routes to maintain contact with Chejiaomin Lane... Hurry up!"</p>
<p>One of these dung beetles was an unusually clever fellow. He had seen with his own eyes that the scout just now had plunged like a dog eating shit and fallen so hard that he had struggled to get up, making himself look bad in front of so many people and losing a lot of the prestige of the "Great Japanese Imperial Army"; so, as soon as he received the order, he immediately raised his hand in a salute, indicating "Order received," and then gently shook his dung beetle body to test the extent to which the floor was shaking; seeing that it was too slippery, he then raised his arms like someone walking a tightrope in a circus, lifted his feet, and first took a step forward in a heron-walking style. Only after this foot was firmly planted on the floor did he follow with the other foot, and his body followed suit, making a big turn in front of his direct superior, before walking out step by step. In this way, he believed that he had preserved his face by not falling down. But he did not realize that such movements, from the perspective of others, inevitably made them suspect that "this guy probably has a problem, and not a small one."</p>
<p>"So you two are here," the fake Kawashima Yoshiko said softly to Pingzi and Tsurumi again, "If I had known it was such a scene, I shouldn't have been so rash... Fortunately, my task is on the one hand to search for "unstable elements," and on the other hand to implement "protection" of our own people..."</p>
<p>"Very kind of you!" Tsurumi coldly interjected, resuming his standard Tokyo accent, and even gave a bow. "Being protected while protecting people, ha, that's very interesting."</p>
<p>"I hope that you only protect your own people!" The fake's face was covered with a dark sneer.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay!" Pingzi was still smiling, seemingly trying to smooth things over and bring the two sides together. "Let's not mention "protection," we are all here on orders, and we must take the overall situation into account!"</p>
<p>"The source of the orders is different, right!" Mizi's face was even darker, "But I must ask you a question... This building, I hear, is very complicated. Are you two responsible for guaranteeing that there are no lurking enemy agents? If you are responsible, I can go back immediately and report according to your wishes. If you cannot be responsible, it is best to let me carry out the inspection!"</p>
<p>These two sentences were no different from a double slap in the face, one on each cheek of Tsurumi and Pingzi, hitting them right on the ear. Pingzi has a gentle temperament, so perhaps he would not get angry. But Tsurumi is naturally a bit irritable, and I am very worried that he will not be able to hold back and will explode.</p>
<p>"Miss Inoue is right," Tsurumi seemed to be able to hold back his anger, "We will not talk about being responsible for the time being. The reason is very simple, because I do not have to be responsible to Miss Inoue, nor can I be responsible to your superior Miss Kawashima Yoshiko, and even less do I have to be responsible to your department chief, Director Doihara..."</p>

<h3>Dream</h3>
<p>— Qingguo</p>
<p>"Dream," and "happiness," who can explain them?</p>
<p>In the dark night, you can sleep peacefully and dream peacefully.</p>
<p>In dreams, there is another world. Many people, many generations, grow there, enjoy themselves there, and die there.</p>
<p>But if you light a lamp to look at the people lying down and dreaming, you can see them smiling, crying, speaking, and singing... but you should understand that the people dreaming will not know.</p>
<p>People dreaming may be happy.</p>
<p>But I hope that one day the people dreaming can truly wake up, and in the bright light, realize how they are lying on a bed in a small room, and realize that in the cold corners, there are murmurs echoing, which they themselves do not understand, coming from their dreams.</p>

<h3>Tian Shou's Assorted Morsels</h3>
<p>— Hei Yun</p>
<p>Mr. Tian Shou's fiftieth birthday should be a major event in the literary, drama, and film circles, because Mr. Tian himself is a history of innovation in Chinese drama, starting from the "Southern Society" until he engaged in various local operas and Peking opera reform movements, which has indeed marked a glorious historical moment in the Chinese drama circles for decades!</p>
<p>Because the birthday star has extensive social connections, people from all aspects are celebrating his birthday, which is worthy of being a grand gathering of the literary, drama, and film circles in the 36th year.</p>
<p>Many people who are usually not easy to meet also met here today; many friends who have not seen each other for more than ten years also shook hands and talked happily here today.</p>
<p>The auditorium of the Ningbo Fellow Association is not large, so it is particularly crowded. Especially at the entrance, it is really shoulder to shoulder, and there is no room to move.</p>
<p>Everyone's chest is adorned with a red silk ribbon that says "Tian Shou," because everyone is beaming with joy, so everyone has the style of drinking wedding wine.</p>
<p>Let me give you a description of several figures:</p>
<p>"Birthday Star" Tian Han, wearing a French beret and a long gown, sat properly in the first three rows, sometimes being pulled onto the stage, and sometimes wanting to run off the stage. Once, as he was about to come down, he was grabbed by Hong Shen and pulled back. Everyone burst into laughter. Someone whispered offstage:</p>
<p>"The birthday star is still shy!"</p>
<p>Hong Shen hosted the birthday celebration program on stage, talking and laughing, and giving a simple introduction to each program.</p>
<p>The figures who gave birthday speeches were various and varied, and each person who came on stage was very interesting. For example, Ye Shengtao read a birthday poem in his local dialect, saying again and again that he could not speak Mandarin.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang was gentle and well-behaved like a good woman, quietly speaking in front of the microphone; while Guo Moruo was like "spring thunder" flashing with lightning, and every sentence was met with applause from the audience. Mr. Pan Gongzhan's speech was also a good speech. Zhou Xinfang's speech, at its climax, was full of the style of the Qilin School.</p>
<p>Under the stage, there were as many film and drama people, famous directors, university professors, and newspaper reporters as carps crossing the river. Let me try to write about a few figures: Shu Xiu'ai, who was preparing to go on stage to participate in the "Seven Women in the Storm" recitation program, was wearing a milky yellow scarf and chatting with friends on the aisle; Bai Yang was dressed in a gray coat, dressed in spring attire; Zhang Ruifang and Cao Yu, who had just returned from the United States, squeezed back and forth; Jin Suqin and Jin Suwen sat in the very back row, remembering that Jin Suqin had once performed the improved Peking opera "The Peach Blossom Fan," etc., but now she looked much more haggard. Jin Yan had something growing on his eyes and was with Wu Yonggang and others, Zheng Junli and Huang Chen were hiding in the corners; Jin Shan and Zhao Dan, who were the young actors of that year, were now in different situations. Jin Shan seemed much fatter, while Zhao Dan still had the graceful style of the handsome university professor in "Distant Love."</p>
<p>Ying Yunwei was standing in the corner talking and laughing with people, this old man seemed to have lost his teeth, Tang Huaiqiu was holding a coat, preparing to recite "Suzhou Night Talk." When this play was performed in the South City that year, it brought away so many people's tears.</p>
<p>There were many programs on stage, the drama won full applause, and the laughter was endless. After the local operas, there were many wonderful performances.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu and Yuan Xuefen were waiting to go on stage to give their congratulations. In the evening, at the Huibin Building, all the guests and Tian Shou Xing were preparing to drink themselves into a drunken stupor.</p>
<h3>Old Tune—Replayed</h3>
<p>— Xueyi</p>
<p>One winter evening, my sister and I were sitting in front of the fireplace reading a love letter sent by my boyfriend. At this time, my father was buried in reading the newspaper, but in the end, he couldn't help it and scolded loudly, "May God save us from these unbearable sounds." When my mother heard this, she silently put down the woolen pants she was knitting and motioned for us to go out with her. When we returned to the room, our old father was constantly cursing those young lads. We couldn't help but tell him, "Dad, you haven't heard the worst yet, let us read it to you!" So my sister continued to read. It was a letter full of passion and seemed to make people feel gentle and rippling. But before she finished reading, my father shouted angrily, "No, no, I have never heard such a cheesy thing, I forbid you to reply to this letter." We ignored him, let him scold for a while, but we were secretly laughing, because when we showed him the letter, we realized that this letter was the love letter that our father himself sent to our mother on January 1, 1915. (Translated from the February 1947 Reader's Digest "Love's Old Sweet Song")</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Bamboo Branch Poems</h3>
<p>— Chi Fu</p>
<p>Taiwanese folk literature should have its value in literature. In his early years, Mr. Liang Qichao, and Mr. Li Shuzhang, a contemporary of Taiwan, collected many of them. Taiwanese bamboo branch poems are popular lyrics among Taiwanese men and women. Translating their meanings, they are as sad as the complaints of "Gu Feng" and "Xiao Bian," which are enough to show the sorrow of the loyalists of the past half-century. Now, I have selected and organized the collections of Mr. Liang as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The man's family lives in Sanchongpu, and the woman's family lives in Baishihu; the roads face each other only a few steps away, will the man try to turn around and see if the woman is there?</p>
<p>(2) The chive flowers bloom with a branch, when the flower is yellow, the leaves are fat; I wish the man would pick the flowers and leaves together, and I will never leave his heart until death.</p>
<p>(3) Talking about love under the acacia tree, loving the man and hating the man, but the man does not know, the acacia seeds are formed on the treetop, is it when the man is traveling and thinking of the woman?</p>
<p>(4) Holding a firewood knife into the firewood mountain, the heart of the firewood is not broken, but the firewood is climbed, the man is easily unfeeling, when will the firewood branches return to the tree?</p>
<p>(5) The man beats the big drum and the woman beats the gong, bowing to the Mazu goddess in the west of the sky; this life is enough to suffer from lovesickness, beg for no torment in the next life.</p>
<p>(6) Beating betel nuts in the green shade, dipping them in betel leaves to persuade the man; I wish the man would find it astringent in his mouth, and taste the bitterness and sweetness carefully.</p>
<p>(7) The taro grass flower blooms straight like a brush, the parasol trees are neatly tailed, and the sun shines to the west, the man is like a sunflower in the dew, and the woman is like a leaf that stands out in the wind.</p>
<p>(8) Teaching the man to come early, but the man is late, teaching the man to take big steps, but the man is slow, I thought to wait for the man for ten years, but my heart is sad before five years are over.</p>
<p>(9) The banana leaves are long and hard to cover the sun, the sugarcane flowers are good but cannot withstand the frost; the fat bananas are eaten by someone when they are old, I want to send them to the man, but I am worried about the long road.</p>
<p>(10) The man gave the woman a poinsettia, and the woman gave the man an orchid, the red blood tears will eventually run out, and the butterfly wings hang low so that the man can dry them.</p>
<h3>Art and Literary Circles</h3>
<p>The comprehensive magazine "Reader's Digest" bi-monthly, volume four, issue three has been published, with main topics including: The Gold Policy That Changes Eight Times in Ten Years, "The King Loves Beauty," "Revisiting the Dream," "Journey to Taiwan," and more than twenty other articles, all worth reading.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Xuexiang's "Bi Bao" (Pen News), in the form of a small newspaper and the style of a large newspaper, meets readers at sea today.</p>
<p>The famous translator Geng Jizhi, who recently passed away, translated "A Sportsman's Sketches" (original by Turgenev) during his lifetime, which is one of Geng's best translations. The book is published by Cultural Life Publishing House.</p>
<p>"Memory" by Ba Jin, "A Living Man's Wife" by Luo Shu, "Iceland Fisherman" translated by Li Lieven, and "Autumn" by Li Jianwu have recently been resold by Cultural Life Publishing House, and books are available in major bookstores.</p>
<h3>Lan Ma and Shangguan Yunzhu in "Paradise Dream"</h3>
<h3>The Use of a Scholar</h3>
<p>— Lei Ke</p>
<p>When I was studying in middle school, a teacher once told us that every object has different aspects, and a person's perception of the form of an object differs from others depending on their position. For example, if I stand at the back door of a house, I only see garbage all over the ground; another person stands at the front door of that house, and his impression is of a deeply locked gate; a third person goes inside, and his description is of carved beams and painted rafters. Another person enters in the middle of the night and feels that it is gloomy. In fact, the so-called garbage all over the ground, the so-called deeply locked gate, and even the carved beams and painted rafters, and the gloom, are all just aspects of the same object. Combined, they are the whole; separated, they are single aspects. Every aspect is correct, but every aspect cannot represent the whole.</p>
<p>For more than ten years, I have never forgotten this sentence. It gives me a broad perspective on life, so that I am not biased towards my own opinions, and I am willing to try to understand even the absurd theories of anyone, and I dare not despise them. Even the so-called "bright side" and "dark side" have a different meaning to me.</p>
<p>Little did I know that such a view has become a laughable irony in recent years. I know a reporter who works as a correspondent for two major domestic newspapers in a certain place. The positions of these two major newspapers are completely different, but he writes news reports that are acceptable to both sides without any problems. He can see both the light and the darkness of any object. The light and the darkness appear separately in two places, allowing two groups of readers to get two diametrically opposed impressions, and thus hold two different views. These two views are created under the ingenious pen of the same reporter.</p>
<p>People say that "a scholar is useless," but after seeing this situation, one can probably know that a scholar has other uses.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Your affairs are easy to handle, but what about the nation's tea? Isn't tea also a resource?" Old Zhu said with a sneer, "The nation's foreign exchange comes from selling tea. But compared to your undershirts, towels, stockings, shirts, newsprint, and drawing paper, tea is worth less than a penny! Isn't it?"</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming couldn't help but blush at his words.</p>
<p>"Oh, brother!" he pleaded.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I can't do anything to you!" Old Zhu put down his legs and sat upright. "In these turbulent times, it's truly the world of you businessmen and corrupt officials! Troubled waters make for good fishing. Isn't that how the old saying goes? We party newspaper reporters and those involved in theatrical movements are worthless fools. What can we do to you?"</p>
<p>The other party seemed somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>"You absolutely don't need to worry," he said, his words full of sarcasm, but his face still smiling insincerely. "Do you think I would report you? Officials protect each other. Old Zhu wouldn't be so foolish as to write articles in the newspaper to scold you or produce plays to mock you! I've seen through it all now. No matter how well an article is written, it's useless. No matter how moving a play is performed, it's useless. In Chinese society, the hearts of some people have turned into unfeeling fossils. They still read the newspaper and watch plays. They will praise good articles and applaud good plays. But after putting down the newspaper and leaving the theater, they have no impression whatsoever! They are still them!..."</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming just shook his head, trying to interrupt several times but failing. At this moment, another person had entered the room; Xu Shaoming looked at her with a wry smile; Old Zhu, engrossed in his speech, didn't notice.</p>
<p>The person who entered was a tall, slender, and exceptionally beautiful young woman. Her demeanor and clothing powerfully indicated that she was a highly educated woman with ample knowledge. But when her gaze met Old Zhu's face, her whole body seemed to be shocked, and all her nerves tightened; although her refined upbringing allowed her to try her best to control herself, and she quickly regained her composure, her gaze could no longer be moved from this slender figure.
