<h3>北方呼聲</h3>
<p>— 方康</p>
<p>今日中國，瘡痍滿目，但無疑的「華北」是受着全國人關切的。最近一兩月內，由於蔣主席，張院長以及軍政大員的絡繹北上觀察，這種關切已更形顯著。</p>
<p>全國人關切華北的原因很易指：一因道一塊地方首先淪陷，受禍最久；二因華中甚至華南，雖云伏葬朱靖，但畢竟火藥氣味很淡，或者根木嗅不到，而華北却至今砲火速天，斯殺未已；三因華北地病民貧，遠遜江浙，亦不逮湘粵，當此天寒地凍之時，更足令人動悽惻之念；四因今日擾亂之戰，「亂」方已含有國際背景，華北雖非邊疆，而密運邊彊，又何能不今全國人憂心忡忡？</p>
<p>基於上述五大原因，我們身處華北的人，更應以華北的眞情，華北的實需，向全國讀者報導，向全國讀者呼　。</p>
<p>今日華北情形有亟待改善的爲政治爲經濟。請先言政治。</p>
<p>勝利後，華北政治局面有一絕好現象，即絕不地方化，絕不特殊化。的確，抗戰勝利給中央絕好的機緣，一切殘餘的特殊勢力可以一掃而空。華北本爲前淸京　地區，或爲鄰近京畿地區，腐化勢力根深柢固，自袁氏稱帝，張勳復辟，乃至北京政府時代，蔓延不絕。抗戰勝利，實爲千載一時之廊淸機會，但勝利倏逾二年，華北政治上有許多情形仍待改進。</p>
<p>我們這裏願先扼要的指出兩點：</p>
<p>一，華北的政治問題在大城市，也在小　。</p>
<p>二，華北的急務在「足食」。</p>
<p>我們先談第一點。第一點應分開來說。像目前正在努力工作的「平津冀軍紀吏治督察團」，他們的對象，只能限於較大城市，尤其是平津兩處。道一臨時的機關設立，就說明華北的政治是有問題的；但限於經費，限於人力，限於工作時期，（本年底當結束），迄今爲止，天津益世報有兩次關於他們的新聞的標題是很巧妙的：一次說他們準備打一「乳虎」　一次說他們捕一「小鼠」；較小的城市，像唐山，督察團就只能匆匆一去，於是人民都感覺來不及說話。不過無論在大城市，小城市，政治上的問題，聽說的似乎只是「貪污」，只是消極的「扒糞」，而積極的如何加强行政效率，我們還沒有聽到。也許在局部方面，某一位市長或某一位局長正在埋頭苦幹，然而以華北的重要，幾個行政中心的效率不提高，即使貪汚一掃而光，如果在積極方面，不能有所建樹，在今日戰亂時期，恐怕不僅亂不能戡，反將使亂源擴大，亂苗滋長。</p>
<p>可是今日既談戡亂，我們就應該瞭解，今日大亂不在於城市，而在於鄉村。所以今日要挽救華北，要拯救華北人民，要與共產黨爭民，唯一的要訣，只有改進各小縣及縣以下的政治。這是中央政府萬萬顧不到的，這也是省級政府現時所忽略的，這更是「督察團」所力有未逮的，這尤其是戎馬倥偬中不少軍事長官所未曾考慮到的，然而影響所及，華北有若干地區的人民，竟致嘆息不如寄生匪區之爲愈。這眞是令人痛心的事！</p>
<p>我們今天已指出病狀，但我們亦應一說病源。病源往往非常複雜。敵偽時代所遺留的惡風氣，一也；受共產黨破壞倫常道德的宣傳，二也；衣食不足，不知禮義，三也；爲從權計，若干地方政府，甚或利用地方不良份子，四也；有此四因，遂使百分之九十五之華北鄉村乃陷於水深火熟之中。病源既明，即可對症下藥。我們以爲對前兩點病源，應積極樹立良好風氣，而尤應從整肅軍風紀着手；收復區的靑年敎育，更應特別注意；軍隊中的政工人員尤應着重於人品的標準；第三點尤爲迫切，矣足而食不足，亦可以為亂源，有時或過之。至於第四點，則完全合於古人所說「養織胎患」，更不可不下決心，施以割治。</p>
<p>現在日說筆者認爲最應注意的一點——民食。我們且不談華北所應包括的各省，我們亦不談遼闊的鄉區，即以平津兩市而言：人口共計三百五十餘萬，每月每人所需的糧以四十斤計，每月即需糧約七萬餘噸；附近軍隊以二十萬人計算，每月約需四千噸，這樣龐大的數字斷不是木地的生產額所能趕得上的，因此近兩月來，華北各報，不斷地在火聲疾呼「南糧北運」；我們也確實聽到某輪船載來多少噸麵粉的好消息，我們也親眼看到巨輪汽車在故都街市上滿戰麺粉，風馳電掣而過，然而近幾天來，糧價又在躍漲了；原因是數不淸的，除了奸商的操縱以外，東北本爲華北主要糧源之一，雜糧更多來自東北，然而遝輸棧時遭破壊，甚至根木不通；何况本年東北因遼河氾濫成災，災區達二千八百九十餘萬畝，災民多至一百五六干萬，於是平津一帶的糧食也大受影響。國軍控制的地區，農田本不甚多，加以共區的加緊封鎖，况今年因雨水太遲，麥吿欺收，華北產量銳减；而共產黨的戰略之一，又是攻則搶糧，退則燒糧，有了上述稱種原因，華北糧荒之嚴重，已可想而知。</p>
<p>政府眷念華北，同胞關懷華北，當華中一帶的讀者讀及吾文時，華北人民已到了飢寒交逼的時候，曾到華北「觀光」的官或民，勿眩目於北平六國飯店的富麗，勿憧憬於萬壽山的旖旎風光，應知在你耳目所不及的地方，不知有多少人正在生命綫上作最後的掙扎。</p>

<h3>周以德力促援華</h3>
<p>（上接一版）周以得出席衆院外委會時稱：美國務院中某一「赤色細胞組織」，曾始終設法阻撓對中國中央政府之援助，「在以不干涉政策之掩飾下，吾人曾干涉中國中央政府」，渠呼　對中國進行軍事及經濟援助，並要求美國立即轉向渠所稱之爲美國援助中國政府之百年政策。渠稱：「吾人在亞洲必須獲得思想戰爭之勝利，否則，在歐洲亦將失敗」，此兩洲在此一方面不能個別分開。渠稱：目前中國人民之健康情况，由於豐年及聯總救濟之故，情况極爲良好，惟經濟情况極爲惡劣，通貨膨脹「實際已無法控制」。渠稱：中國人民確在爲復興國家堅苦工作，渠稱：約有廿名之美國作家及評論家，幾在同時開始散布言論，謂中國政府貪汚及無能，就渠本人言之，渠不能爲中國政府洗刷，但其缺點言之過甚，而其實力則被忽視。周以德稱：美國外交史上最大之唯一錯誤，係將美國極重要之利益與中國內部整肅運動混淆，以往馬歇爾之赴華調解，在其離開美國之前，已註定要失敗，因命令中規定其任務係在中國政府恢復和平與秩序後，美將對華予以援助也。渠指此無異向共黨公開邀請其作妨害中國和平與秩序，除非採取解決中國內部局勢之步驟，則美國對全球之計劃定將失敗，而此祗有以軍事敎練形式，予中國軍事援助，並以捐助及供給需要之接濟品形式，予中國物資及經濟援助，始能遂到目的，渠稱：全部亞州之安定，繁於中國之安定，因朝鮮在目前比之在日本佔領下經濟上遠爲惡劣共聽命於莫斯科，係屬「毫無疑問」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：今日四外長代表會議中，蘇代表堅持必須光討論對德和約，英美法代表則主張先討論對奧和約，會議遂陷僵局。此僵局如無法打開，則程序間題將交四外長自行討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教十四日電〕四外長代表今日已同意將德國臨時政治機構之方式及範圍，以及奧國條約委會之報吿等兩項列入下屆外長會議程。外長代表並會討論英外相貝文向其他三國外長建戰之於某一未議定之事項顯然已禾能有所進展時，可毋庸網續討論。當外畏代表討論是否應將此一建議列入外長會之議程時，蘇代表史米諾夫即謂外長代表祇能討論議程，無權提出程序方面之建議，在渠反對之下，討論卒無結果。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕杜勒斯在美參院外交委員會稱：如莫洛托夫在外長會議中繼續反對美國建議之防止德國再侵略之四强四十年公約，則英美法當以三强基礎，締結此一條約。渠並主張在德國西部實施若干傑出方式之國際經濟監督，並曰美國政府若信任德國西部增長的經濟統一，即應自魯爾區開始，蓋此乃在經濟上極度重要之區域，而且美國政府之權力亦能及於該處。美國今已在德國，故美國不僅爲美洲强國，且爲西歐强國。</p>

<p>〔路透社紐約弗魯辛十四日電〕聯合國大會今日以四十三渠對零票，通過設立聯合團委員團以監督朝鮮完成獨立之案，北歐三國及三阿拉伯國家棄權，蘇聯集團六國拒絕參加表決。聯大並以卅四票對七票，否決決蘇聯所提要求美蘇軍隊於明年一月以前同時全部自韓撤退之案，此案表決時棄權者十五國之多，投贊成票者僅蘇聯集團六國及埃及。</p>
<p>聯大並指定中國。印度。敆利亞。澳洲。加拿大。法國。菲律賓。薩爾瓦多組織委員團，烏克蘭亦爲委員之一，但其代表已聲明拒絕參加。聯大今日　過之決議案，並規定朝鮮獨立之程序，計　至遲於明年三月卅一日舉行選舉；　選舉後儘速召開國民議會，以組織國民政府；　由國民政府自組國軍，並解散不屬國軍範圍內之一切軍事部隊；　與美蘇佔領當局按治，俾儘可能於國民政府成立後九十天內，完成美蘇軍之自韓撤退。</p>

<p>〔聯合社漢城十五日電〕美國佔領軍當局今日宣稱：聯大會現已通過決議案，囊助朝鮮獨立自主，則美蘇混合委會及莫斯科協定已吿壽終正寢。惟蘇聯既拒絕參加聯合國監察團在朝鮮行使職權，則南韓美軍佔領區勢必另成一國，聽任北韓渝入蘇勢力範圍。聯合國斃察團前來工作時，南韓當局全力與之合作，惟能否進入北韓則甚可疑。南韓如單獨舉行選舉，則右派定可得絕對多數，親共派人數有限，且恐將拒絕參加選舉。另有一部份觀察家則以爲蘇聯或出其不意，突然撤退駐軍，使聯大決議歸於無效，幷　迫美軍亦撤。惟蘇聯所無把握者，北韓共黨是否有力控制朝鮮全國耳。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖十四日電〕聯合國經濟學家十四日預料美國如不能實行對外新貸款，則美國來年將發生經濟蕭條。此項預言係在聯合國中立經濟專家，應聯合國經濟與就業委員會之要求，對世界通貨膨脹問題所作之八十六頁報吿中揚露者。該報吿强調指出，歐洲之金元供應實際上業已枯竭，如無新貸款，則勢將停購美貨。美貨外銷如驟行銳减，則美國勢必引起失業，其後且將波及拉丁美州。</p>

<p>議長詞畢，繼由王區長，張副亞長，陶區代表衣會主席相網致詞，對議長過去對楊樹浦區之貢獻功績一一闡述，表示擁護之意。又潘議畏將於今日上午九時至十二時赴虹口區公所，下午二至六時赴北四川路區公所訪問。</p>

<h3>妨害婚姻詐欺案　鞠光藻初受審　否認曾拐顧國華之妻　借黃金祇是保人地位</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕以經商爲名勾引良家婦女詐取財物之鞠光藻，經地檢處依妨害婚烟及詐欺罪，提起公訴後，昨日上午十一時半，在地院刑二庭由鍾推事開審。首由楊丁秀雲證稱：「三十六歲，無錫人，住復興中路五二一號，與劉沈麗英爲十餘年老友，識鞠光藻係劉之紹介，去年年底，鞠謂因需「頭寸」甚急，願以田契作押借款。</p>
<p>經我作保，</p>
<p>商請陳陸章英借才赤金五十兩。十二月卅日交鞠，，因鞠拿不出田契，以我名下海防路地皮三畝三分抵押，中人是劉沈麗英言明二個月後歸還，期滿後鞠延不償付，至今年三月巾，才由我設法壽得二十兩，先還陳一部份，鞠的田契則交給我作担保。以後我屢次向他</p>
<p>討還金子</p>
<p>二十兩，他都推說沒錢，直到八月間，他忽然來說：「我朋胡顧堅毅已於臺灣回來，上次他托我借的金子，現在他已跟臺灣省魏主席夫人講好，魏夫人願借三千元美金，代他償還，不過要擔保品，上次人給你的田契請你給我，好去換美金」。我深信不疑，就把田契還他，誰知他受審時之　光藻（本報訊）</p>
<p>一去不返</p>
<p>，美金至今並未見到」。繼傳　沈麗英證述借金條經過，與楊丁秀雲所稱相同。繼訊熟知借貸經過之徐肇祺，證述所見借金情形，並稱：「鞠光藻與劉沈麗英是同居關係，已有三年，他們的二房東也知道的」。又據顧國華之母顧程氏稱，鞠會將其媳顧蘇同傑拐走，並携去許多金飾。末傳鞠光藻，鞠身材頗長，紅光滿面，儼然一大商賈模樣供：「奉賢人，四十三歲，不知蘇同傑爲何許人。去年年底曾代友人顧堅毅向楊丁秀雲借過條子五根，到今年四月</p>
<p>還過二根　　，餘下三根，後來連同利息一兩五錢四分提存地檢處，合國幣一千五百十三萬九千二百元。顧堅毅實有其人，住南匯北六灶鎭貿和軋米廠。所以這次借貸，我不過是保人地位而已」。至此原吿顧國華之律師提呈附帶民訴賠償，稱原吿與蘇同傑誼屬夫婦，民卅三年三月十九日，鞠引誘原吿之妻，捲取自飾現款潛逃，姘居在外，蘇彼時且懐七月身孕。其後產下，取名大良，謊稱係鞠之子，現請鈞院准予離異，並責令償還結婚時之筵席贊及精神損失費三億，及歸還被捲逃之財物云云。楊丁秀雲之律師亦請求地院責令追還赤金卅兩，並稱鞠適才所供金條係顧堅毅所借一語，實屬狡賴，蓋已函請南匯鄕長査得，並無顧堅毅其人。至此，庭諭鞠光藻交原保三億力退庭，啟期再審。</p>

<h3>無錫發現「飛賊」　竊技酷似北平燕子李三黑夜驚豔圖姦怒摑耳光</h3>

<h3>旱象後　浙江秋收</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十三日訊〕浙江省的稻榖，據戰前統計，每年可產八千四百餘萬担，居全國各省的第六位，江南這幾天正在秋收，我們對這全國第六個榖倉的今年收成，自有無窮的關念。</p>
<p>早稻晚稻之分浙江播種糧食，有早晚稻之分，在早晚稻之間，尙有比較早的旱稻，比較晚的晚稻，完全看時令與土地而別。像江南（俗稱浙西）一帶，春天田地上要種春花，還要看春蠶，待春花收起，春蠶盾畢，總要在四五月間，然後他們才耕耘種稻。浙南或是浙中一帶，他們沒有種春花，有的地方更沒有看蠶，所以春初時節，早已耕耘播子了。像沿海浙東一帶，一面倚山，一面傍海，完全賴天助，始能耕種，因爲山上有梯田，小雨下不到平原上，山上的流泉也給山田擋了去，海裏的水是鹹的，不能養稻，因此唯有春夏之交，雨水連綿，才能獲得一個十足的豐收。</p>
<p>富蘭衢收九成今年浙江天氣，十分乾旱，但因爲上述的關係，也有豐收，也有歉收，也有收來的糧食還不了賦的。富春江，關江，衢江兩岸，今年却是豐收，所有桐廬，關　，金華，衢州，龍游，湯溪以及雲和等縣，收成大都在九成以上，正音爲這許多縣中，有的不種春花，有的不看春蠶，有的賴蘭，衡，富三江的灌溉，他們待天旱的仲夏時，早就收起啦旱稻啦了。</p>
<p>沿海一帶歉收沿海一帶如鎭海，寗波，慈谿，定海，溫嶺，象山，樂淸，玉環，永嘉各縣，他們雖有的也不種春花，不看春蠶，但是因爲背山面海的關係，又値天氣乾旱，灌溉無由，所以大半都是歉收。前幾天，有位朋友自象山來，他說有幾鄕簡直顆粒無收。像這樣歉收的縣份，當然收來的糧食難以償賦，但是鄕鎭縣級，僅知拍發電文，說是旱災爲患，而沒有把具體的事實調査淸楚報上去，還需要省級派員下去査，再製表報上來，時日遷延，今年的賦是要完了，减賦反在明年，試問今年的痛苦將怎樣予以解除呢？</p>
<p>嘉湖區七八成在江南的地區上，今年自然也感到乾旱，尤其江南農家，多半種春花，看春蠶。當完畢以上兩項工作去耕種田稻的時候，正是驕陽施虐，河乾水涸的當口，幸虧江南河沼多，農胞們用盡全力來搶救，很多地方都已救活了過來。今年嘉湖一帶，可收到七成以上，八成以下。至於杭州和海寗兩地，原本也是非常乾早，後來因爲放西湖水，又在錢江潮未發時放錢江水，這樣也救活了很多。記者曾馳騁在江南的大平原上。見農胞們臉上有一種喜慰之色。</p>
<p>海寗紅葉十里到海甯去的時候，我看見很多農胞，都添一些新衣穿在身上，一擔擔潔白的棉花，肩挑人市，一細網甘蔗，都預備售與水菓行家。小尖山的廟子裏，香火鼎盛。在路上，我們可以看見成羣的婦女們，她們提着香籃，穿着新衣，手持唸珠，在嘰裹咕　的唸着。我們在去海寗的路上，看見兩旁的紅葉，竟有十里之遙，眞是奇觀。據說今年的柏子樹的柏子特別好，所以紅葉也特別盛，這也證明海寗農村在走向復甦途中的一個徵象。</p>
<p>靠洋米救濟？我曾問過浙江省田糧處的負責人，今年收成情形如何，他的回答是恐怕與去年比起來，要打一個八折，顯然的，今年是比去年差了。</p>
<p>現在，有的人這樣想：反正有洋米來了，我們年成差一些，也沒有關係。我以為這種依賴的心理是要不得的，如果眞的永遠靠洋米來救濟我們，眞將不成其為一個國家了。今年歉收以後，我們正應該設法使明年獲一十足的豐收，如何豐收？這有待於今年的政府當局與一些農業專家硏究一個詳細的定案。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>聯華隊馬到成功六比四小勝鐵路　今日第二仗對抗靑白</h3>
<p>馬來亞聯華足球隊，昨日下午三時與本市鐵路在逸園球塲作征滬首戰，慕名作璧上觀者計達七千餘人，二萬五千門券售出二千九百五十六張，五萬券計一百十七張，冷寂之逸園球塲頗覺熱鬧，角逐結果，上半時客軍以三此○佔先，下半時鐵路反攻甚烈，叛回四球，總結馬華隊以六此四勝鐵路，昨日雙方出塲陣容如下：</p>
<p>聯華　朱志成　陳家萬　楊嘉松　黃國棟　李以耀　巫錦成　葉淸榮　謝文良　夏體先　胡文相　梅潤華　鐵路　廖雄　岳仁孝　徐　源　黃春林　吳嘉邦　曹禮明　蕭子文　吳炳浩　張　　陸慶祥　林典羲</p>
<p>客軍征滬第二仗今日下午三時起對抗靑白隊，地點仍在逸園，門票仍售二萬五千元及五萬元兩種，中午十二時半起在體育館預售，球塲大門出入與昨日相同。聯華隊昨日對抗鐵路隊以六比四小勝後，其純熟之球藝已充份發揮，惟除中堅李以　最爲出色外，全隊兩前衛較爲散漫，守門之技術未曾發揮，前鋒五虎以W方式進攻，利用兩內鋒落後帶球，兩翼之包抄戰術，爲滬上各隊所不及，個人球藝，咸以長力充沛爲惟一之優良演出，今日相逢　白爲保持遠征軍令舉計，對陣容之支配，經昨晚商討公佈決定仍以昨賽原班陣容出塲，預卜經昨日戰後，必有更優異之演出。</p>
<p>靑白隊爲上屆全滬甲組聯賽盟主，麾下戰將皆爲第一流好手，惟孟義良高保正費春華三騎士留港，原定昨日返滬，未見到達，今日能否趕到，尙成問題，致今日出塲人選頗感困難，且嚴士鑫於華聯隊出征南洋之歸途在港受傷，迄今未愈，今日不克登塲，昨日經隊長許文奎愼密安排後，公佈決定除原有好手外，另以靑白之年靑小將混合編配，故實力亦稱堅强，屆時迎職客軍爲發揮全滬盟主威風計，定有熱烈演出。據靑白隊通吿稱：隊員希於今日下午一時半前在百樂門飯店集合，俾同時出發。今日靑白出塲陣容如下：</p>
<p>靑白　秦必高　吳凱敏　吳祺祥　張仁義　瞿永　　謝啓川　薛　然　哈增明　金　生　羅壽福　李義臣　高秀淸　顧以　　姜閣淸</p>

<h3>取締退票已收相當效果　支票抵用將予變通　由行莊選擇客戶准許當日抵用　財政部對此建議原則或可同意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於取締退票問題，據國行稽核處李處長立俠對記者談稱，日來退單已大見减少，過去退票金額常佔總金額百分之五六，目前已减退至百分之一以下，成績相當良好，欲絕無退票，亦實爲不可能。國行已擬就取締退票辦法呈財政部核示，內容包括，整頓各行莊現有客戶，開戶時需特別愼重，必需經人介紹與担保，對外使用堂名或暗記雖仍許可，但必需留有眞實姓名與詳細地址，俾便於査究。退票理由亦重經明確訂立，如過去之「與出票人接洽」等，皆不能視爲理由，以防止行莊從中取巧。同時因當日票據不能抵用，與上海習慣抵觸，且事實上確亦有所困難，亦常因此發生退票。國行近曾向財部建議變通辦法，由各行莊目動選擇客戶，何者允予當日抵用，何者需隔日抵用，允予當日抵用者，抄錄客戶名單送存稽核處，而日後此種客戶之當日抵用支票，行莊不得藉詞退票。李處長並謂，此項建議，財政部在原則上，大致可以同意云。</p>
<h3>散多競相吐售　棉紗布行情下游　藍鳳細紗較上日降二百萬元</h3>
<p>棉紗市况，因隔日漲勢過巨，散多頻有吐售，更以紡建公司配價雖提高，開出額子甚夥，同業銀根軋緊，買戶觀望，行情遂吿下游。結果四十二支藍鳳細紗，回進四千萬關，塲外價喊三千九百五十萬元，軋降二百萬元。其他各支粗細紗，亦均一致回跌七八十萬至一百餘萬元不等。</p>
<p>棉布市况，晨開交易閒散，喊價即吿猛退。九時半後，經檢當局到塲監視，人心尤虛，浮多競吐，行情步瀉。迨至最後，十二磅龍頭等各種細布，較上日回跌二·三萬至四·五萬元。嘩嘰直貢供多求少，亦降一萬五至四萬五千元。其餘各種布價，亦疲多於堅。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司照例開售棉布，計卅八種，掛廿支二一支無牌細布價爲八十八萬元，限布號申購。藍鷄B字細布八十九萬元，限染廠申購，但申購者甚少。</p>
<h3>食米先漲後回　油市上落互見</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬三千八百餘石，各貨欲漲無力，均成先漲後回之勢。粳秈米開盤甚堅，午時轉懈，結果微升三五千至萬元，白陰元仍少上落。</p>

<h3>對美出口貿易　發展機會甚多　劉大鈞談美需要土產　出口貨應符合美標準</h3>
<p>〔本報美國通訊〕近數月來，我國進出口商感覺對外貿易之困難，記者適在華盛頓，專訪我國駐美商務參事劉大鈞氏。據謂戰時美國政府，對工商界生產及分配各方面，均有嚴格管制，同時海外商運斷絕，故美國工商界無法展開對華貿易。勝利以後，美工商界積極復員，從事進出口業務，尤以最近七八個月來，美商紛紛向本處請代介紹我國商人，以接洽進口業務者，日必數起。其中雖多向我國推銷貨物，而欲採辦我國商品者亦不少。彼等所擬採購者，除桐油·生絲·茶葉·猪鬃等我國主要外銷物品外，其他雜類亦甚多。甚至如竹桿·麝香·紗織手套等，均欲向我國設法洽購。本處皆根據我國商行名錄，代為價紹。同時我國進出口商，不能直接向美商從事接洽買賣時，亦逕函請本處介紹。惟目下我國出口商品，因不合美國標準，往往連至美國後，發生糾葛，因此遭受損失者，亦不乏其例。關於此點，實爲我國出口商應切實注意者。我國進出口商目前雖暫感到困難，如能力謀進展，前途當仍樂觀云。</p>

<h3>大戶斬售頻仍　華股低價收巿</h3>
<p>華股昨永紗大勢已去，中途雖有掙扎，但人心喪失殆盡，終難持久，呈開盤最高，收盤最低，一根大黑綫，最爲慘厲。業中大戶之斬售頻仍，使少壯派及四川路錢兌帮之買勢，不能有效。浮多過於擁擠，臨收有瓦解之象。</p>

<h3>暹京政變影響金融　盤谷大城銀行倒閉</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕據甫由暹京返抵香港之來客談，暹京政變以後，除金價略受波動之外，商塲未見波動。惟政變發生之日（九日），新政府當局以標榜淸算「豪門資本」爲號召，因宣吿僑胞陳漢初（又各乃磊）等十人所簽發之支票一律停止使用。査陳氏係曼谷大城銀行經理，該行自新政府宣佈停止支票使用以後，即（九）日已發生擠兌現象。是日因行方尙可應付，得以安然渡過。但次（十）日擠兌情形更見擁擠，該行至是始無法應付，即吿倒閉。與大城銀行同時發生同一情形者，有亞洲銀行，該行因前（十一）日新政府取銷禁止該十人所簽之支票使用之命令，幸未倒閉云。</p>

<h3>閑話「先生」</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>數年前在湘西一職業學校，有女工名楊嫂者，每稱呼校中敎員周先生時，輒略去一字，直呼爲周先（生），聞之甚爲刺耳，且覺其不敬，殊不知先生或只稱一字，古已有之，不多讀經史，多識前言往行，誠未可以知人論世，且不免少見多怪之議也。按趙賢廿四史劄記載：「古時先生二字，或稱先，或稱生，史記　錯傳；錯初學於張恢先所。漢書則云：初學於張恢生所，一稱先，一稱生。顏註云：皆先生也。又黽錯傳：校尉鄧公諸公皆稱爲鄧先。顏註亦曰：鄧先生也。買禹傳：禹以老乞駭骨。元帝詔曰：朕以生有伯夷之廉，史魚之直。師古註。生謂先生也。梅福上書曰：叔孫先非不忠也。師古亦註：先謂光生也。是古時先生或稱先，或稱生，不必二字並稱。」</p>
<p>夫楊嫂者，一傭婦耳，初不知先生可稱爲先或生，而偶合於古，吾輩號稱讀書人，倘貿然而非笑之，反不免爲稽古通識者所嗤，批評熊度，可勿愼歟！雖然，先生之在今日，固未可以先或生稱之也。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>臉譜的妙用</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>舊劇中的臉譜，劇評家的說法，其妙用就在强調劇情，表現人物的性格。例如猛將的額上，畫着一匹老虎，小丑的鼻端，圖一隻烏龜，忠臣是紅面，奸佞的面孔是白的，草莽英雄的臉譜，是花花綠綠的，諸如此類，劇中人的忠奸邪惡，觀衆們便一目瞭然，也可便利於演員的表情，使劇情容易深刻化。</p>
<p>臉譜的又一種妙用，就是要議演員們知道，當在化裝室圖繪臉譜時，是預備上台做戲了，就將放業自己的性格，以劇中人的性格，就將利用紅黃藍白黑的顏色，來遮掩自己的本來面」，充分表現戲劇的情節。在做戲是，那面上畫了一匹老虎的猛將，爲了假戲眞做，可以和花花綠綠的草莽英雄打架相駡，爭得死去活來，鬧得天翻地覆，接連打上三百個回合，還不分勝負；那巧笑倩兮，粉白油險的花旦，可以和相公調情，弔公子哥兒的膀子，在後花園裏，眉來眼去；鼻端上畫了一隻烏龜的小丑，見了眼紅，他可以從花旦的褲襠裏竄來竄去，嗅嗅是什麼味兒……反正，這一切的動作，在演員們心裏，觀衆的眼光裏，都是雪亮，「我們是做戲，你們是看戲。」</p>
<p>但在戲演完了，或者這一幕戲已吿一個段落，大家便揩淨了臉譜，現出各自的本來面目，和和氣氣走下舞台。大家原都是一副班子裏的同事，在一齣戲的演出，主角固然重要，就是搖旗吶喊，跑龍套的，也不可輕視，所以都能互尊互重，保持友好的空氣。剛才在舞台上打架相駡的紅臉與花臉，此刻仍舊有談有笑，言歸於好了。因爲戲演完了，大家已揩淨了險上的顏色，走下了舞台。就是在舞台上向相公調情的花旦，及抹去了臉上的油彩，亦若無其事矣，她也有自知之明，剛才並不是賣弄風騷，而是表現戲劇中的情節</p>
<p>搞政治，也是做戲，政治舞台上的人物，和舞台上的戲子是同樣的身份。要把政治搞得好——就是要把政治舞台上的戲做得像樣，上了台，不免要塗着老虎，烏龜……種種的臉譜，在假戲眞做，或眞戲假做；可是，下了台，擦淨了臉上的老虎烏龜時，就必須互尊互重，和和氣氣，保持誠懇的友誼。如果舞台上的演員們，不認淸台上與台下的區別，不論上台與下台，永遠畫着紅·黃·藍·白·黑的臉譜，永遠不肯擦去臉上的老虎與烏龜，在台上打架，台下也打架，台上相駡，台下也相駡，那就永遠無法協調，不問假戲與眞戲，一定永遠做不好。</p>
<p>現代民主政治的特色，就是，上台時，從各個演員的臉譜上，可以看出你是什麼黨，我是什麽派，下台時，都能自動擦去臉上的老虎與烏龜，大家都承認是同一副班底的同事，在台上的打架相駡，並不是爭意氣，搶權利，是爲要做好戲，爭取觀衆的同情和擁護。</p>

<h3>說雙卿</h3>
<p>— 吳鑑明</p>
<p>日昨見百里先生作「疊字漫攝」一文，所言田家婦雙卿，以通篇疊字塡「鳳凰臺上憶吹簫」，生動有緻，惜不許其姓氏云云。按雙卿賀姓，字秋碧，淸丹陽人，自幼天資聰頴，雍正時爲金沙綃山農家周某室，奈遇人不淑，抱恨而卒，著有雪壓軒詩詞，白雨齋詞話云：「雙卿負絕世才，秉絕代姿，爲農家婦，姑惡夫暴，勞瘁以死，生平所作詩詞，不願遺留墨迹，每以粉筆書蘆葉上，以粉易脫，葉易敗也」，黃韻甫謂「雙卿詞如小兒女，噥噥絮絮，訴說家常，見見聞聞，思思想想，曲曲寫來，頭頭是道，作者不自以爲詞，閱者亦妄其爲詞，而情眞意摯，豈非天籟？豈非奇才？乃其所遇之窮，爲古才媛所未有，每誦一過，不知涕之何從也」。而予所見者，尙有薄倖，摸魚兒，惜黃花慢等數闕，亦皆凄憫動人，洵一代才女也。</p>
<h3>鐙下雜記　劉玉川與門客</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<p>「臨安將危時，文天祥語幕官曰：「事勢至此，爲之奈何？」客曰：「一團血。」文曰：「何故？」客曰：「公死，某等請皆死。」文笑曰：「君知昔日劉玉川乎？與一娼狎，情意稠密，相期偕老。娼絕賓客，一意於劉，劉及第授官，娼欲與赴任，劉患之，迺紿曰：「願與汝俱死，必不獨行也。乃置毒酒令娼先飲，以其半與劉，劉不復飲矣。娼遂死，劉逎獨去。今日諸君得毋效劉玉川乎？客皆大笑。」</p>
<p>我們雖沒有看到文天祥的幕僚們怎樣地笑，但那一副嘴臉，却也是不難想像的吧。主人的一笑，和客的大笑，眞形成了一個絕妙的對照，這裏包含了多少人情味！想不到文天祥竟也會這樣幽默，輕輕幾句笑話，就連門客的心都被勾出來了。於是，彼此「心照不宣」，自然也只好打着哈哈散塲，這笑聲又像解嘲，又像喝采，技巧是好的，但那股尷尬相，却怎麽也掩飾不了。</p>
<h3>水中飛行的鳥</h3>
<p>— 林梅</p>
<p>凡是鳥類，大都在空中飛行的，祗有少數的鳥，有的在水中涉行，有的在水中游泳，要找尋在水中能够飛行的，可就誰都沒有見到。然而，天下奇怪的事情很多，在水中游泳的魚，既有一種能够飛出水面的飛魚，那麽，飛在空中的鳥，當然也可以在水中飛行的了。這種飛行水中的烏，名字呌做「河鳥」，因爲牠的窠是造在瀑布後面的，因此人們不容易見到，於是就不知道有一種在水中飛行的鳥了。</p>
<p>河鳥的住處，大都在瀑布的附近處，牠用蘚苔來造成像圓球一般的窠，位置大都是在山巖下面的瀑布的背後。這地方是普通的鳥類不能到達的。牠的窠在一邊有一個細小的口。牠飛回去的時候，常常是穿過瀑布的。</p>
<p>在急流中流下的幼蟲，便是牠們的食物。這些幼蟲，有的住在溪流中的嚴石之下，有的疾琉在急水之中，河鳥常常潛入水底去找尋食物，如果牠發現到了一條小蟲，在急流中疾馳而過，牠就跟在小蟲的後面，扇着牠的翅膀，在水中追逐上去。牠的脚上不像鴨一樣的有着蹼，所以不會在水中游泳的。牠在水中飛行，正似在空中一樣的。</p>
<p>世界之大，眞是無奇不有，研究動物學的人知道有這樣的鳥，然而研究動物學的人究竟不多，所以很多人對之有的不相信，有的感到奇怪了。</p>
<h3>兩朝領袖</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>錢收齋既娶柳如是，寵愛若神仙，爲別築精舍居之，顏其室曰「我聞」，取金剛經「如是我聞」之義也。一日挈之遊虎邱，牧齋衣小領而大袖，遇一士人前揖，問此何服制，牧齋曰：「小領爲新朝法服，大袖者所以示不忘於先朝也」。士人謬爲改容曰：「公事新朝，尙不忘故國，用心良苦，眞可謂兩朝領袖矣」！牧齋大窘。</p>
<p>按錢謙益，身爲禮部尙書，事急，不與弘光俱走，而與大學士王鐸都督越其傑等同以南京迎降，奴顏事敵，至此尙謂不忘先朝，恬不知恥，眞可謂老而不死，若歷史允許的話，大可與五朝元老的馮道並傳然馮道雖身事九君，但觀其自稱無德無才痴頑老子之語，（按馮道事契丹，朝耶律德光，德光問曰：爾是何等老子，對曰：無德無才，痴頑老子，德光喜，拜爲太傳）猶有幾分自知之明，故終其身只是糊裏糊塗的做官吃飯，不敢出風頭，較之錢謙益甘心事敵而尙欲釣譽沽名自命風雅者差勝一籌也。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯揭露：四强外交秘密</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>還有從日本駐莫斯科大使佐籐給日外務省的公文看來，他倒是一個實事求是，和有作爲的外交人員。他吿知日本政府說，他所接到的文書，在性質上過於含混，蘇聯政府決不會加以考慮。假定只憑美麗的詞句而後有實質，他們決不會被說服的。除了日本預備投降之外，曠廢時日的去試探蘇聯政府的意思是徒然無益的。蘇聯既力主德國無條件投降在前，她當然順從英美所提的日本無條件投降。佐籐說，他明知他的見解與聖上的懿旨相悖，但是即使「罪該萬死」，「我還是要保留數千百萬，徒死無益的生靈」。他更加强地說，「日本除了無條件投降之外，不再容有其他選擇」。</p>
<p>如果日本政府眞能聽從佐籐之言，而無條件投降的話，投擲原子彈誠非必要。但是軍閥們還夢想着和平談判，置佐籐之忠吿於腦後。七月廿一日，日本政府訓令其駐莫斯科外交代表道：「在任何情狀之下我們不能接受無條件投降。即使戰事延長，流血更多，在敵人無條件投降的要求下，我們要運從天皇的命令，對敵人作戰至一兵一卒而後已」。</p>
<p>日本政府不再經由瑞士或瑞典，而直接和蘇聯來往，以便通知蘇聯，他們準備全部接受蘇聯在遠東方面的一切要求，他們希望，由於應允蘇聯的要求，可從而獲得在和談中獲得帮助，他們還希望由於這樣的商談，去切實找出蘇聯會不會參加作戰。</p>
<p>直到原子彈擲投於廣島之後，日本內閣才決心投降。據日本外務省的紀錄，八月十日蘇聯駐東京大使咨文東條，蘇聯已簽署波茨坦宣言，並與日本成立戰事狀態。東條接着便把請由瑞士轉交美國，表示日本除了保持日皇統治權之外，願意接受投降的文書副本，給蘇聯大使帶交蘇聯政府。</p>
<p>日本的投降較我們理想中的時間爲快，但是我們已早有準備了。國務院，陸，海軍部等合組了一個委員會，準備處理受降及佔領的一般命令。有一件棘手的事情發生了，就是誰配去接受日本的投降呢？諸强都同意麥克阿瑟將軍堪以代表他們和美國去受降。但海軍方面對此表示異議。福勒斯脫海軍部長綜合他們的意見爲：太平洋作戰海軍是主幹，海軍士卒從珍珠港起，一直一個島一個島的打到東京；他們把日本的海軍給消滅了。因之麥克阿瑟可爲聯合國簽證降書，而尼米滋上將應該代表美國簽字。我同意福氏的理論，海軍自應參予其盛，並答應他設法一切。當夜，福勒斯脫從電話中建議，接受日本投降的儀式在「米蘇里」戰艦上舉行。我深切了解，這就是海軍所謂的「陸軍噱頭」了。假使他僅僅的說「一隻戰艦」，這問題辯論之處尙多。但是他既提了米蘇里，我知道這件事獲得解決了。當總統接到這項建議時，自然，他以爲這個主意再好沒有了。這樣，一件海陸軍相持的事情，總算順利解決！（預約處申報館）</p>

<h3>中報社會服務工作之一　晴霞孤寡貧病救濟金</h3>
<p>第十七次申請至十七日截止——歡迎捐款</p>
<p>日子過得眞快，晴霞救濟金，從去年七月開始，到現在已經有十六個月了。在這一年多的時間裏，我們前後頒發了十六次救濟金，假使每次受到我們援助的人，以十人計算，那就是說，我們已經帮助過一百六十位苦難的同胞。</p>
<p>雖然，我們的力量是那麼薄弱，但是我們總想以各界捐款，給予顚連無吿的貧窮同胞，表示同情的慰藉；同時也能使他們感覺到在道冷酷無情的社會裏並沒有被完全遣忘掉，這也許會使他們重新感覺到生之意味，鼓舞起新的勇氣。由於贊助者和同情者不斷的捐輸，我們的救濟工作才能够連續的綿延下去，但因爲幣値變遷，和申請的人數日益增加，我們已經感到許多困難。要克服這些因難，我們需要熱心的贊助者和同情者給予我們更多的支持。</p>
<p>天快冷了，苦難的同胞正在殷切的盼望着援助，親愛的讀者，請趁早的解囊相助罷（捐款請交申報館社會服務科收）</p>
<p>（第十七次申請定十七截止，自十八日起，開始第十八次申請，凡貧苦同胞，可繕申請書請保長或甲長證明，並覓妥舖保，寄本欄審核，合格後即酌予助款。）</p>

Fengxian and Peixian counties are firmly held by the National Army. Xuzhou has a strong military presence, and the city remains as calm as usual.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The threat posed by the communist bandits to the northwestern periphery of Xuzhou has been eliminated through the National Army's air force cover and the advance of tank units. However, Yao Lou and Twenty-Eight Mile Post on the southwest, as well as Gaojiaying, Erbao, Sanbao, and Caocun along the Jinpu Railway Line, were once again disturbed by the bandit's 16th and 2nd Columns on the morning of the 15th, and are being attacked by the National Army from the north and south.

<h3>Communist Bandits in the Jilin-Changchun Area of Northeast China Retreat to Their Old Nest on the Pingmei Road, High Command Commends the Soldiers Defending Jilin</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 15th] Over the past few days, communist bandits in the Jilin-Changchun area have been retreating to their old nest in the Xifeng-Xi'an area along the Pingmei Road and appear to be concentrating. It is estimated that the 11th Bandit Column has reached the southwest of Xifeng, and another 2,000 bandits have reached the west of Xifeng. The main force of the 2nd and 3rd Columns is also in this area. More than 6,000 bandit stretcher bearers are also moving from Yitong to Xi'an. The Eastern Mongolian Independent 1st and 2nd Divisions are moving south. Judging from the bandits' movements, they seem to be planning a final struggle in southern Liaoning. The 8th Bandit Column is eyeing Jinzhou, and Huludao is about to be closed. The National Army has withdrawn from Yingkou Port because it is about to freeze. The bandits have not forgotten these two ports.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 14th] "The heroic soldiers of Jilin bravely repelled the superior and stubborn bandits, demonstrating our supreme revolutionary spirit, which is truly commendable. I hope that all officers and soldiers will remain vigilant at all times and not be taken advantage of by the bandits. This is my hope."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The communist bandits' so-called sixth offensive in Northeast China has now reached the stage of exhaustion. According to an analysis of the situation in Northeast China by a certain military observer here: The bandit army in western Liaoning is no longer capable of rising again. There are no traces of bandits in the areas on both sides of the Beining Line. The Pingjin Line will be open to traffic soon. After the National Army recovered Dashiqiao in Yingkou, the situation in southern Liaoning is becoming increasingly unified. The bandit army, which besieged Yongji for more than 20 days, withdrew from the periphery of Yongji due to its inability to overcome the strong defense and heavy losses. The 1st and 3rd Columns of bandits, gathered on the outskirts of Changchun, are now in the Yitong-Xi'an area. The main force of the 2nd Column has fled from the vicinity of Shuangyang to the Taojiatun-Fanjiatun area along the Zhongchang Line. The 4th Column has crossed the railway and fled west. The 6th Column is in Dehui and the 10th Column is in Jiutai, and another bandit force is entrenched in the Nongan-Huaide area. The bandit army has now changed from attacking Yongji to besieging Changchun. The able bandits are avoiding direct contact with the National Army everywhere, only occasionally sending small groups to roam around. The National Army has long seen through their tricks and is also adopting a steady and solid approach, closely monitoring the bandits. He also said that Northeast China has been experiencing severe cold for days, and the ground is slippery with snow, so there will be no major battles in the short term.</p>

<h3>Glorious Victory in Yulin, Besieged Bandits Starving and Freezing, Increasing Numbers Surrendering, Yuanshi City South of Shijiazhuang Stands Firm</h3>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 15th] The Yulin defense battle, for which both sides made great efforts, has in fact come to an end. There are no more bandit troops within 5 li around the city. The defending troops, with inferior equipment and less than 10,000 combat troops, resisted the communist bandits' ten brigades for twenty days, creating another glorious victory, which is truly a miracle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 15th] Military News: The Air Force flew in batches from Xi'an and Taiyuan to assist in the battle in the southwestern region of Jianlin on the 15th. Furthermore, the bandits surrounded in that area are suffering from both the National Army's heavy blows and the pressure of hunger and cold.

First, condolences were offered for the recent death of Legislator Wu Wentian. Then, the following important cases were discussed and passed: Case on selecting people from various parties to jointly participate in the provincial, municipal, and county senates and temporary senates; Amended draft of the Feast and Entertainment Tax Law; Draft of the Housing Lease Ordinance; Amended draft of the War Criminals Trial Ordinance, which was not amended according to the review opinions; Amended draft of the Central Meteorological Bureau Organization Ordinance; Amended draft of the National Funeral Law and Public Funeral Ordinance; Special Criminal Cases Litigation Ordinance, and the duration of the Supplementary Ordinance for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery and the Supplementary Ordinance for Handling Criminal Litigation After Recovery were each extended for one year; China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement; US-China Relief Agreement.

<h3>Selecting Members of Both Parties to Participate in Local Councils</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The issue of members of the Minzhu and Qingnian parties participating in local public opinion organizations was raised again at the Legislative Yuan plenary session on the 15th. After about an hour of discussion, it was passed in accordance with the resolution made during the review. During the discussion, Kuomintang legislator Di Ya expressed his sincere opinion, saying: "The provision that the Minzhu and Qingnian parties participate in the county senates by selecting personnel to account for one-fifth should be seriously considered before a decision is made. The reason is that the number of counties in the country is relatively large, and the Minzhu and Qingnian parties do not currently have members in every county. If members are temporarily recruited to meet this need, it may repeat the mistakes of the Kuomintang in setting up county party headquarters everywhere in the past. Not only will the party's foundation be weak, but it will also attract criticism." The full text of the resolution is as follows: "In accordance with Article 72 of the National Government's policy guidelines, before the re-election of the current senators of the provincial senates and the municipal senates under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the National Government may select up to one-fifth of the original number from outside the existing number of senators to be provincial senators or municipal senators under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Before the re-election of the current senators of the county senates and the municipal senates under the jurisdiction of the provinces, up to one-fifth of the original number may be selected from outside the existing number of senators to be county senators or municipal senators under the jurisdiction of the provinces. The selection methods shall be determined by the National Government by order."</p>
<h3>China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement May Be Signed This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement may be signed this month. Dai Xiujun, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, reported on the review process on the 15th, pointing out that the articles and annex format of the China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement are roughly the same as those of the China-US and China-UK Air Transport Agreements, but its content is simpler. The main points are as follows: The agreement is valid for four years, and either party may terminate it by notifying the other party with a one-year period. Air routes: three routes for each party. The Dutch direct route goes from the Netherlands through Europe, North Africa, India, Burma, Siam, and Vietnam to China, and then follows the Pacific air route to the United States. There are also two Nanyang air routes, one: from the Dutch East Indies through Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam to China, and the other: from the Dutch East Indies through the Philippines to China. In addition to the Nanyang route being the same as the Dutch return route, the direct route from China goes through Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, India, North Africa, Europe to the Netherlands, and then to Scandinavia or the United Kingdom and the United States. The Dutch party agrees not to carry passengers and cargo between Hong Kong and Shanghai in either direction, on the condition that any third country other than the United Kingdom also does not carry them. Before the official signing of this agreement, air transport operations on the Nanyang air routes of both parties may be started first. (Draft of the China-Netherlands Air Transport Agreement.

<h3>Housing Lease Ordinance Reduces Excessive Privileges</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there was a severe housing shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai, and housing disputes occurred frequently. To this end, the Legislative Yuan specially drafted a Housing Lease Ordinance, which was revised and revised repeatedly, and after adopting the opinions of municipal public opinion organizations in Nanjing, Shanghai and other places, it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan plenary session on the 15th and has been passed, and is expected to be implemented soon. After this case was submitted on the 15th, Chen Guyuan, convener of the Civil Law Committee, explained the drafting process and the spirit of the law. According to reports: This case was submitted for the fourth time. Previously, it had been drafted several times based on the Nanjing Municipal Housing Lease Management Regulations and other regulations, and experts from the Shanghai Law Association were once convened to listen to their opinions. Later, the Nanjing and Shanghai municipal governments, local courts, chambers of commerce, and business federations all submitted opinions, and the Shanghai Municipal Senate also conducted detailed discussions. Therefore, this ordinance was formed by adopting the opinions of the public. Its spirit is mainly to formulate a fair and more feasible ordinance under the principles of impartiality and not being bound by facts, to protect tenants, support landlords, and eliminate second landlords. The legitimate interests of all three parties will be protected as much as possible, and all excessive privileges will be reduced as much as possible. According to the original proposal, a tenant who sublets a part of the house should first obtain the written consent of the landlord. Now it has been changed to "A tenant may not sublet the entire house to others. If the lease agreement contains provisions against subletting a part of the house, the written consent of the landlord should be obtained first, or the sublease agreement should be submitted to the landlord for signature." This is much fairer. Article 21 also stipulates that "Provincial and municipal governments may formulate supplementary measures to meet the needs and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval." With this provision, local courts can handle disputes based on the supplementary measures formulated by the local governments, unlike in the past when supplementary measures were only used for reference and had no legal binding force. In addition, this ordinance also contains reasonable provisions for the situation where a tenant sublets the entire house to others before the implementation of the ordinance.</p>

<h3>Northern Voices</h3>
<p>— Fang Kang</p>
<p>Today's China is riddled with sores, but without a doubt, "North China" is receiving the concern of the entire nation. In the recent month or two, due to the successive visits of President Chiang, President Zhang, and senior military and political officials for observation, this concern has become even more pronounced.</p>
<p>The reasons for the national concern for North China are easy to point out: first, this region was the first to fall and has suffered the longest; second, although Central and even Southern China may be preparing for battle, the smell of gunpowder is very faint or even undetectable, while North China is still experiencing fierce warfare; third, North China is afflicted by poverty and hardship, far behind Jiangzhe and even less developed than Hunan and Guangdong, which is even more heartbreaking during this cold winter; fourth, the current turmoil already has an international dimension, and even though North China is not a border region, it is closely linked to border regions, which cannot but cause national anxiety.</p>
<p>Based on the above five reasons, we, the people living in North China, should report the true situation and real needs of North China to the national readers and appeal to them.</p>
<p>The most urgent areas for improvement in North China today are politics and economy. Let us first talk about politics.</p>
<p>After the victory, there was an excellent phenomenon in the political situation of North China, namely, the absolute absence of localization and specialization. Indeed, the victory of the War of Resistance gave the central government an excellent opportunity to completely eliminate all residual special forces. North China was originally the Beijing area of the former Qing Dynasty, or adjacent to the capital region, and corrupt forces were deeply entrenched, spreading continuously from Yuan Shikai's ascension to the throne to Zhang Xun's restoration and even the era of the Beijing government. The victory of the War of Resistance was truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity for purification, but more than two years have passed since the victory, and many aspects of the political situation in North China still need improvement.</p>
<p>Here, we would like to briefly point out two points:</p>
<p>First, the political problem in North China exists in both large cities and small counties.</p>
<p>Second, the urgent need in North China is "sufficient food."</p>
<p>Let's talk about the first point first. The first point should be discussed separately. For example, the "Pingjinji Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group," which is currently working hard, can only target larger cities, especially Tianjin and Beiping. The establishment of this temporary agency shows that there is a problem with the politics of North China; however, limited by funding, manpower, and the working period (scheduled to end at the end of this year), so far, the Tianjin Yishi Daily has had two very clever headlines about their news: one said they were preparing to fight a "small tiger," and the other said they caught a "small mouse." In smaller cities like Tangshan, the supervision group can only make a brief visit, so the people feel they don't have time to speak. However, whether in large cities or small cities, the political problem seems to only be "corruption" and the passive "mucking out," and we have not heard about how to actively strengthen administrative efficiency. Perhaps in certain areas, a certain mayor or a certain bureau chief is working hard, but given the importance of North China, if the efficiency of several administrative centers is not improved, even if corruption is completely eliminated, if there are no achievements in the active aspect, in today's time of war, I am afraid that not only will the chaos not be quelled, but it will expand the source of chaos and foster chaotic seedlings.</p>
<p>But since we are talking about suppressing chaos today, we should understand that the great chaos today is not in the cities, but in the countryside. Therefore, the only secret to saving North China, rescuing the people of North China, and competing with the Communist Party for the people is to improve the politics of each small county and below. This is something the central government cannot possibly take care of, it is also neglected by the provincial government, it is beyond the power of the "supervision group," and it is especially not considered by many military officers in the midst of military affairs, but as a result, some people in North China even sigh that it is better to live in the bandit areas. This is really heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Today, we have pointed out the symptoms, but we should also talk about the sources of the disease. The sources are often very complex. The bad habits left over from the enemy-puppet era are one; the propaganda of the Communist Party that undermines ethical morality is two; insufficient food and clothing and ignorance of propriety are three; for the sake of expediency, some local governments even use local bad elements, four; with these four reasons, ninety-five percent of the villages in North China are in dire straits. Once the sources of the disease are clear, we can prescribe the right medicine. We believe that for the first two sources of disease, we should actively establish a good atmosphere, especially starting from rectifying military discipline; special attention should be paid to the youth education in the recovered areas; political workers in the army should especially focus on the standards of character; the third point is especially urgent, and even if there is sufficient food and clothing, it can still be a source of chaos, and sometimes it may even be worse. As for the fourth point, it completely conforms to what the ancients said about "nurturing a hidden danger," and we must make up our minds to perform a surgical removal.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the point that I think is most important -- people's food. Let us not talk about the provinces that North China should include, nor let us talk about the vast rural areas, let us just take the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin as an example: the population totals more than 3.5 million people, and if each person needs 40 catties of grain per month, then each month requires about 70,000 tons of grain; if we calculate 200,000 troops nearby, they need about 4,000 tons per month. Such a huge figure is definitely not something that local production can keep up with, so in the past two months, newspapers in North China have been calling out loudly for "grain from the south to be transported north"; we have indeed heard the good news that a certain ship has carried many tons of flour, and we have personally seen huge trucks and cars full of flour on the streets of the ancient capital, speeding past, but in the past few days, grain prices have been soaring again; the reasons are numerous, in addition to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the Northeast was originally one of the main sources of grain in North China, and more coarse grains came from the Northeast, but the transportation station was destroyed and even completely impassable; moreover, this year the Northeast was flooded by the Liao River, causing disasters in more than 28.9 million mu of land and affecting as many as 15 or 6 million people, so the food supply in the Beiping and Tianjin area has also been greatly affected. The Kuomintang-controlled area does not have much farmland, and the Communist areas are tightening their blockade. Moreover, this year, because the rains were too late, the wheat harvest was reduced, and the yield in North China was sharply reduced; and one of the Communist Party's strategies is to seize grain when attacking and burn grain when retreating. With the above-mentioned causes, the severity of the food shortage in North China can be imagined.</p>
<p>The government cares about North China, and compatriots care about North China. When readers in Central China read my article, the people of North China have reached the point of being starved and cold. Officials or civilians who have been to North China for "sightseeing," do not be dazzled by the magnificence of the Six Nations Hotel in Beiping, do not dream of the beautiful scenery of Longevity Hill, you should know that in places beyond your sight, there are countless people struggling on the lifeline.</p>
<p>The Capital's various circles held a General Mobilization Rally to Suppress Chaos and Eliminate Traitors, and paraded after the meeting. The photo shows the scene of the procession passing through the Xinjekou Square. (Central News Agency Photo)</p>
<h3>Zhou Yide Strongly Urges Aid to China</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) When Zhou Yide appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he said: A certain "red cell organization" in the U.S. State Department has always tried to obstruct assistance to the central government of China. "Under the guise of a non-intervention policy, we have intervened in the central government of China." He called for military and economic assistance to China and demanded that the United States immediately turn to what he called a century-old policy of U.S. aid to the Chinese government. He said: "We must win the ideological war in Asia, otherwise, we will also fail in Europe." These two continents cannot be separated in this respect. He said: The health of the Chinese people is currently very good due to the good harvest and the relief provided by the United Nations, but the economic situation is extremely bad, and inflation is "virtually out of control." He said: The Chinese people are indeed working hard to revitalize the country. He said: About 20 American writers and commentators have begun to spread comments at almost the same time, saying that the Chinese government is corrupt and incompetent. As for himself, he cannot clear the Chinese government of wrongdoing, but its shortcomings are overstated, and its strengths are overlooked. Zhou Yide said: The biggest and only mistake in the history of American diplomacy was to confuse the extremely important interests of the United States with China's internal rectification movement. The previous trip of Marshall to China for mediation was doomed to fail before he left the United States, because the order stipulated that the United States would provide aid to China after the Chinese government restored peace and order. He pointed out that this was tantamount to openly inviting the Communist Party to obstruct China's peace and order. Unless steps are taken to resolve the internal situation in China, the U.S. plan for the world will be doomed to fail, and this can only be achieved by providing military assistance to China in the form of military training and by providing China with material and economic assistance in the form of donations and supplies of necessities. He said: The stability of the entire Asia depends on the stability of China, because Korea is economically far worse than it was under Japanese occupation and is "undoubtedly" at the beck and call of Moscow.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand People Enthusiastically Paraded at the Nanjing Conference to Suppress Chaos and Eliminate Traitors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Capital's circles held a rally to suppress chaos and eliminate traitors at the National Assembly Hall Square at 9:00 a.m. today. More than 100 organizations, totaling 100,000 people, participated, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Dong Yuhua delivered an opening speech, briefly outlining the meaning of suppressing chaos and eliminating traitors, and said that the people of the capital should be a model for all parts of the country when supporting the government's mobilization to suppress chaos. Then, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, Mu Huaxuan, the cultural circles, Ren Zhuoxuan, the trade unions, Li Tingzhen, the farmers' associations, Jin Jiapei, the women's representatives, Ni Liang, and the student representatives, Shu Guangdi, delivered speeches, criticizing the communist bandits' actions of sending troops to create chaos, destroying national peace, and colluding with foreign forces. They hoped that the people of the capital would lead the people of the country to rise up together and participate in the work of suppressing chaos with action. Afterwards, the meeting passed a declaration, a telegram of respect to President Chiang, a telegram of condolences to the soldiers suppressing chaos, and a letter to the compatriots across the country. After the meeting, a parade was held, which was the most grand and enthusiastic since the restoration.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Hong Kong Dollar Depreciation, Guangzhou Market Price Declines All the Way</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] Due to rumors of the third phase of Hong Kong dollar devaluation, the market price of the Hong Kong dollar began to weaken and decline. From morning to night, it fell from 17,000 yuan to 16,300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nantong Commodity Prices Fluctuate, Rice and Noodles Rise by 30%</h3>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch on the 15th] From the afternoon of the 14th, commodity prices have been fluctuating constantly. Flour and rice have risen by three-tenths, and the black market for gold is also active. Zhuo Quanji, who is in charge of the private gold black market, has been detained for interrogation by the county government yesterday.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Commodity Prices Continue to Rise, Yarn and Cloth Soar in Recent Days</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 15th] Commodity prices in Xi'an have not stopped rising. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth have been soaring in recent days. Mayor Wang Youzhi said today that he will strengthen price controls. The price evaluation meeting will also allow reporters to participate. To adapt to the military situation, the municipal government still believes that it is necessary to stockpile for three months as a precautionary measure.</p>
<h3>Optimistic about the Future of Trade with the United States, Our Commercial Counselor in the United States Speaks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington Communication] In recent months, Chinese importers and exporters have felt difficulties in foreign trade. According to Mr. Liu Dajun, our commercial counselor in the United States, during the war, the U.S. government had strict controls over the production and distribution of various aspects of industry and commerce. At the same time, overseas commercial transportation was cut off, so the U.S. business community could not start trade with China. After the victory, the U.S. business community actively restored and engaged in import and export business. Especially in the past seven or eight months, many U.S. companies have asked our office to introduce Chinese businessmen so that they can discuss business. There are several cases of this every day. Although many of them want to sell goods to China, there are also many who want to purchase Chinese goods. In addition to tung oil, raw silk, tea, pig bristles, and other major Chinese export goods, they also want to purchase many other categories, even such things as bamboo mats, musk, and sand-woven gloves. Our office has introduced them according to the directory of Chinese business firms. At the same time, Chinese importers and exporters cannot directly introduce themselves to U.S. merchants. At present, China's export commodities often fail to meet U.S. standards and are rejected after being shipped to the United States. Chinese exporters should pay attention to this point. Although Chinese importers and exporters are temporarily experiencing difficulties, if they can strive for progress, the future is still very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Tea Production This Year Is Poor</h3>

<h3>Various Customs Offices Seize Over 17,000 Cases of Smuggling</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Smuggling in South China and other coastal areas has long become a serious problem.

<h3>Most of the Bandit Troubles in Guizhou Province Are Pacified</h3>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch on the 15th] After several months of suppression, most of the bandit troubles in the province have been pacified. Currently, there are only more than 2,000 remaining bandits in Guixian, Wuyi, and Hengxian areas in the province, which need to be actively eliminated. The most urgently needed thing at present is the inconvenience of transportation. The monthly cost of transporting soldiers exceeds 1.5 billion yuan. In order to make up for this deficiency, the province has borrowed from merchants in major cities, obtaining a total of 25 billion yuan to be used as security expenses, hoping to pacify the bandit troubles in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Dulles Clarifies U.S. Policy Towards Germany – Emphasizes Revival of Ruhr Region – No Agreement Yet on Agenda for Foreign Ministers’ Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 15th (Broadcast): In today’s meeting of representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers, the Soviet representative insisted on exclusively discussing the German peace treaty, while the British, American, and French representatives advocated discussing the Austrian peace treaty first, resulting in a deadlock. If this deadlock cannot be broken, the procedural issue will be submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers for discussion themselves.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers have today agreed to include the modalities and scope of the temporary political organization of Germany, as well as the report of the Austrian Treaty Committee, on the agenda of the next Foreign Ministers’ Conference. The Foreign Ministers’ representatives also discussed the British Foreign Secretary Bevin’s suggestion to the other three Foreign Ministers that when a particular agenda item has obviously made no progress, it should not be continuously discussed. When the Foreign Ministers’ representatives discussed whether to include this suggestion on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers’ Conference, the Soviet representative Smirnov stated that the Foreign Ministers’ representatives could only discuss the agenda and had no right to propose procedural suggestions. Discussion ended without resolution due to his opposition.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Dulles stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that if Molotov continues to oppose the American proposal for a forty-year four-power treaty to prevent German re-aggression in the Foreign Ministers’ Conference, then Britain, America, and France should conclude such a treaty on a three-power basis. He also advocated implementing some outstanding form of international economic supervision in West Germany and stated that if the U.S. government trusts the growing economic unity of West Germany, it should start with the Ruhr region, as this is an extremely important area economically, and the U.S. government’s power can extend there. The U.S. is now in Germany, so the U.S. is not only an American power but also a West European power.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] Republican foreign policy expert Dulles will accompany Secretary of State Marshall to London to attend the Four Foreign Ministers’ Conference as the chief Republican representative. The entire U.S. delegation will consist of about eighty people, including two experts on Soviet relations, namely State Department Counselor Bohlen and Marshall Plan Committee Chairman Kennan. Many of the expert advisors who participated in the previous Moscow Foreign Ministers’ Conference will also be traveling. Bohlen was the Russian interpreter for President Roosevelt when he met with Marshal Stalin and has participated in various international conferences on European peace treaties after the war. Other important U.S. personnel who will attend the London Foreign Ministers’ Conference include U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas, U.S. Military Governor of Germany General Clay, U.S. Representative to the Austrian Allied Council Keyes, and Flif and Tauky, who represent the United States at the Foreign Ministers’ Representatives Conference. The strength of the lineup is unprecedented at previous Foreign Ministers’ Conferences.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Passes Korean Independence Resolution – Establishes Nine-Nation Commission – Soviet Request for Troop Withdrawal Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 15th (Broadcast): According to sources close to UN Secretary-General Lie, the staff members of the nine-nation commission dispatched to Korea by the United Nations will be led by Deputy Secretary-General Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese representative.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed a resolution to establish a UN commission to oversee the completion of Korean independence by a vote of forty-three to zero. The three Nordic countries and three Arab countries abstained, and the six countries of the Soviet bloc refused to participate in the vote. The General Assembly also rejected the Soviet proposal calling for the simultaneous and complete withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea by January of next year by a vote of thirty-four to seven. Fifteen countries abstained during the vote on this proposal, and only the six countries of the Soviet bloc and Egypt voted in favor.</p>
<p>The General Assembly also designated China, India, Chile, Australia, Canada, France, the Philippines, and El Salvador to form the commission. Ukraine is also a member of the commission, but its representative has declared its refusal to participate. The resolution passed by the General Assembly today also stipulates the procedure for Korean independence, including: holding elections no later than March 31st of next year; convening a National Assembly as soon as possible after the elections to organize a national government; the national government self-organizing a national army and disbanding all military units not belonging to the national army; and negotiating with the U.S. and Soviet occupying authorities to complete the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea within ninety days after the establishment of the national government, as far as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Flushing, 14th] Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu stated in a speech at the General Assembly that China’s sole purpose is to assist in the unification and independence of Korea, as this would be sufficient to "remove all concerns of China in that region." China is also willing to sign any agreement to guarantee the territorial integrity of Korea, but this agreement has not yet been proposed because China believes that the UN Charter also has the same effect.</p>
<h3>South Korean Provisional Government – To Be Dissolved Upon Establishment of Unified Government</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 15th] The South Korean Provisional Government previously convened a political affairs conference to discuss countermeasures for the current situation and passed several important decisions. It held another provisional political affairs conference on the 12th of this month, revised the original plan, and submitted it to the U.S. Military Governor in Korea for review by the military commander, and then requested the U.S. State Department to ratify it. The most important amendment was to change Article 3 of Section 2 of the original plan to: "The Provisional Government shall transfer all political power to the fully unified Korean government immediately after its establishment."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 15th] The U.S. occupation authorities today announced that since the General Assembly has now passed a resolution to assist Korean independence and self-government, the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission and the Moscow Agreement have come to an end. However, since the Soviet Union has refused to participate in the exercise of its functions in Korea by the UN Supervisory Group, the U.S. military occupation zone in South Korea is bound to become another country, allowing North Korea to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence. When the UN Supervisory Group comes to work, the South Korean authorities will fully cooperate with it, but whether it will be able to enter North Korea is very doubtful. If South Korea holds elections alone, the right wing is bound to obtain an absolute majority. The number of pro-Communist factions is limited, and they may refuse to participate in the elections. Another group of observers believes that the Soviet Union may unexpectedly withdraw its troops suddenly, rendering the General Assembly’s resolution ineffective and forcing the U.S. military to withdraw as well. However, the Soviet Union has no guarantee that the North Korean Communist Party is strong enough to control all of Korea.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Discusses – Location of Next Session</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 15th] The United Nations General Assembly held another plenary session this morning to discuss whether the 1948 General Assembly should be held in Europe.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Passes Bill – French Franc as Currency of Saar</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The French National Assembly today, after heated debate, passed a bill by a vote of 416 to 184, authorizing the government to use the French franc as the currency of the Saar region. Communist deputies voted against it. Some officials from the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine are deeply concerned about the inclusion of the Saar region into the French economic system, as it will have repercussions for these two adjacent provinces, and therefore abstained during the vote. During the debate, Communist deputy LeGras criticized the agreement reached by Britain, the United States, and France on the export of German coal, calling it a shameful act. Foreign Minister Bidault, greatly angered, rose to protest, declaring that he would not allow any deputy to call an agreement signed by the government and beneficial to the country shameful. When explaining the Saar issue, Bidault expressed the hope that, with the friendly cooperation of all the Allied nations, a unanimous agreement on the Saar could be reached at the London Foreign Ministers’ Conference. He also said that, in any case, the Saar issue would be resolved, and the use of the French franc in the Saar would not affect the international agreement on the distribution of Saar coal production.</p>
<h3>U.S. President's Temporary Foreign Aid Bill – Congress to Discuss as Priority – Taft Advocates Submission to Senate Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 14th] Senator Taft declared that the temporary foreign aid bill should be discussed first at the special session of Congress. The bill should be prepared and submitted to the Senate by November 24th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] President Truman may submit a message to the special session of Congress next Monday, requesting authorization to aid other countries in preventing inflation as part of the U.S. overall plan for aid to Europe. White House experts are currently rushing to create an outline.</p>
<p>Dulles Opposes U.S. Loans to Britain</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Republican foreign policy expert Dulles presented his views to the Congressional Foreign Relations Committee, which is reviewing the foreign aid bill, expressing full support for the U.S.’s emergency aid plan for Europe and advocating the adoption of a practical and appropriate long-term plan for the revival of Europe. However, he cited the U.S. loan to Britain as an undesirable example, because "this loan to Britain creates nothing and solves nothing." Dulles believes that the U.S. should determine a clear policy path after completing its long-term plan. The U.S. does not favor the concept of a United States of Europe because this is a dictatorial approach, but the U.S. must declare the policies for which its aid plan is prepared. If any part of the aid plan has circumstances that prevent the implementation of that policy, that part of the plan may be suspended.</p>
<h3>U.S. Economic Recession Inevitable If No Foreign Loans – Observation by UN Neutral Economic Experts</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 14th] United Nations economists predicted on the 14th that the United States would experience an economic recession next year if it could not implement new foreign loans. This prediction was revealed in an 86-page report prepared by the UN neutral economic experts at the request of the UN Economic and Employment Commission on the issue of world inflation. The report emphasized that Europe's gold and dollar supply has practically dried up, and without new loans, it would be forced to stop buying American goods. If U.S. exports were to decline sharply, it would inevitably lead to unemployment in the U.S., which would then spread to Latin America.</p>
<h3>Communists Could Conquer All of Europe in Two Weeks – March Next Year Is the Most Dangerous Period</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Connecticut Republican Congressman Lodge told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that if the Soviet Union decides to abandon constitutional methods of forcing European countries into submission, it could conquer all of Europe, including Spain and Portugal, by force within two weeks.</p>
<p>Lodge said that, according to his observations in Italy this summer, he believes that the Communist Party has a three-step plan to conquer Europe: the first step is to use constitutional methods; the second step is to use force, as is currently happening in Marseille and Naples; and the third step is war. He believes that foreign aid is not enough to prevent the threat of the Communist Party seizing all of Europe, but it is a practical step to avoid this phenomenon. He predicted that the Communist Party would launch a coup in Italy in March of next year and launch a general strike in France. If the coup in Italy is successful, then Greece, the Middle East, and Turkey will all fall into the hands of the Communist Party. The Italian Communist Party is very powerful and can deal with the Italian police in three days. The most dangerous center in Italy is the industrial area in the Po River Valley in northern Italy, where the Communist Party’s power is extremely strong. Once Italy is lost, Greece will lose its lateral barrier and will also be doomed.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Election Mock Voting Held Yesterday, Order Not Yet Perfect, Improvements Needed, Estimated Voter Turnout for General Election Could Reach Over 60% of Voters</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The election of National Assembly representatives in this city is about to be held, and the heads of the polling stations in the city's thirty-two districts have been appointed by the municipal government. The election office and the Bureau of Civil Affairs, in order to enable the responsible persons in each district to understand the election laws and procedures, specially convened the heads of the civil affairs sections of the district offices and the heads of the polling stations at 10:00 am yesterday morning in the Municipal Council Hall on the third floor to hold an election exercise meeting. Director Zhang Xiaosong gave a speech explaining the importance of this election in laying the foundation for democratic politics and warned the staff to take the matter seriously and prevent any malpractices. Then, Section Chief Chen Boliang and others explained the election laws in detail, answered various questions, and issued each person an election manual for reference.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting Tomorrow Morning to Discuss Technical Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The city election office has decided to convene a joint meeting at 9:00 am tomorrow morning at the Municipal Council Hall. Chief Supervisor Zhang Xiaosong, all supervisors, and the district chiefs will attend. As the general election is approaching, various technical issues need to be resolved urgently.</p>
<p>In order for the staff to gain experience, the election office held a mock voting exercise at the Triangle Vegetable Market in Hongkou yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm. Chen Minshu, the section chief of the regional election section of the election office, served as the director and directed the process on site. Citizens participating in the voting were played by more than two hundred people, including the heads and staff of the election polling stations in each district. The Central Film Studio also sent staff to film the exercise. Voting began at 3:00 pm. Voters entered in a line from the entrance, obtained ballots at the ballot distribution points of each bao, then filled them out at the ballot writing points, and then walked to the ballot boxes to cast their votes. At the entrance, the implementation regulations of the recall in the voting rules were posted, stating that anyone who impersonates another person during voting, holds more than two voting rights registered, enters the venue with weapons, or engages in other improper conduct may be subject to recall.</p>
<p>Qian Dajun Receives the Most Votes</p>
<p>The venue also had a list of regional candidates for the National Assembly representatives, including two main sections: the list of party nominations and the list of legally registered candidates. The former had eight candidates, and the latter had a total of thirty-nine. The entire exercise was very fast and was completed in twenty minutes. The results of the exercise were as follows: Qian Dajun received the most votes, with thirty-six votes, followed by Fang Zhi with twenty-three votes, Qian Gongzhan with eighteen votes, Chen Guofu with ten votes, Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi with five votes each, and the rest received two or three votes each. Afterwards, Section Chief Chen Minshu expressed the following review opinions to reporters: 1. The preparation for this exercise was insufficient. 2. Voters could not line up according to the order of the bao when entering the venue, which caused congestion. In the future, during the official voting, it is hoped that voters can line up according to the order of the bao in order to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Voters Should Enter in Single File</p>
<p>3. The police officers did not perform their duties diligently enough. It is hoped that they can perform their duties diligently during the general election voting, and those without voter certificates should absolutely not be allowed to enter the venue. 4. The ballot distributors of each bao must be responsible for verifying voter certificates, stamping them, and distributing ballots at the same time. If voters crowd forward, they will be too busy to cope. In the future, during the real voting, voters should enter in single file. 5. Voters should leave the venue immediately after voting, otherwise it will disrupt order. 6. No women participated in today's exercise. It is hoped that female compatriots will participate more in the official voting in the future.</p>
<p>High Voter Turnout Expected</p>
<p>As for the number of voters who may participate in this city, Section Chief Chen said, "When the city councilors were elected last year, the voting time was one day, and the number of voters was about one-third of the number of voters. This time, the general election voting time is set for three days. If voters are not enthusiastic on the first day, the candidates will definitely mobilize with all their strength to remedy the situation. I estimate that the number of voters will be more than 60% of the number of voters." Also, in the voting process, each bao has an average of 2,000 voters, and everything must be done within two days, so the issue of order is extremely important, which depends on the efforts of the security personnel.</p>
<h3>Council Appoints Supervisory Personnel</h3>

<h3>Speaker Visits Yangshupu District, Delivers Campaign Speech Expounding the Essentials of Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Municipal Council Speaker Pan, in order to understand the current living conditions of citizens in various districts of this city, started his second on-site visit to various districts yesterday. At 2:00 pm yesterday, he first visited Yangshupu District (i.e., the Twentieth District). The district has a total of twenty-one bao, and except for one bao that is far away on Fuxing Island, the speaker personally went to the other twenty bao. The heads of each bao made suggestions, requesting that they be forwarded to the municipal government to improve governance, and the speaker accepted them all and agreed to consider and forward them. Those that could not be presented verbally were instructed to provide them in writing. He then went to the newly completed district office in the district to give a campaign speech. More than a thousand people, including all the bao heads, jia heads, district representatives, and district residents of the Twentieth District, went to listen to the speech and felt excited.</p>
<p>The speaker delivered a speech explaining the significance of electing National Assembly representatives, proposing three points, stating: "On December 25th this year, the government will convene the National Assembly to implement the constitution. The people will be the masters of the country, and all officials and civil servants will become servants of the people. However, there should also be methods for the people to be masters. The first is to manage 'people' (including officials, civil servants, and people's representatives, etc.). The second is to manage the many laws and regulations of the country. With these two kinds of power, we are not afraid that the country will not be well managed. The power to manage people is the power to elect and recall. The power to manage laws is the power to initiate and refer. Currently, because the government is just beginning to implement constitutional government, we only need to exercise the right to vote. There are three points to report about this: First, the National Assembly representatives are directly elected by the people, starting on the 21st of this month and ending at noon on the 23rd. In another month, legislators will be elected. Anyone who is 20 years old or older, regardless of gender, has the right to cast a vote. The relationship between the elected representative and each person is very important, so please consider carefully. Second, I hope that the citizens of this district will not give up their right to vote. The gains and losses of managing the local and national affairs in the future depend on this one vote of yours. Third: This time, the central government has stipulated that there are ten regional representatives in Shanghai, of which two are nominated by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party. I have been designated by the central government as one of the eight candidates for the Kuomintang. I was elected as a city councilor and was produced by Yangshupu District. Last time, I was not abandoned by you and was elected as a city councilor, and then I was elected as the speaker. In the past year or so, although I have not been able to make every thing successful, I believe that I have done my best to do it, and it has had some effect. If I can be elected as a National Assembly representative this time, I will still make suggestions to the central government on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, and always take care of the welfare of the citizens and try to alleviate their suffering. I will do my best to realize what the citizens of Yangshupu District hope for. Finally, as an aside, the winter relief fundraising has begun, and I hope that the citizens of Yangshupu District will help as much as they can within their ability. At the same time, there are also the most refugees in this district, and they are often frightened by the demolition of shantytowns. I have decided to discuss with the competent authorities to postpone the demolition in order to alleviate the difficulties of the people."</p>
<p>After the speaker's speech, District Chief Wang, Deputy Director Zhang, and Tao, the chairman of the District Representative Council, successively delivered speeches, elaborating on the speaker's past contributions and achievements to Yangshupu District, and expressing their support. Speaker Pan will visit the Hongkou District Office from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and the North Sichuan Road District Office from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm today.</p>
<p>Fang Zhi Gives Public Campaign Speech</p>

<p>(Another Dispatch) In view of the imminent general election, all circles in this city, in order to enable citizens to understand the essentials of the election laws, exercise their right to vote solemnly, prevent possible malpractices, and promote the spirit of national law-abiding, have scheduled a general election propaganda meeting to be held at the Queen's Theater at 9:00 am on the 19th. The National Assembly candidates designated by the central government will all participate and deliver campaign speeches. Mayor Wu Guozhen and Inspector Jiang Jingguo will also attend the meeting to give instructions.</p>
<p>Chen Guofu Gives Up National Assembly Election Campaign</p>
<p>Chen Guofu, a National Assembly representative candidate of the Kuomintang in this city, sent a special letter to the City Party Department on the 15th, stating that he was giving up the election campaign due to poor health. Chen is a veteran of the party and the country, and he was previously unanimously supported by all circles in this city to run for the election. After learning the news that Chen had given up the election campaign, they were extremely admired for Chen's humility. The original letter from Chen to the City Party Department is recorded as follows: "Yun Qi: I, Guofu, have recently been ill and declare that I am giving up the election campaign for National Assembly representative. I respectfully hope that you will appreciate this and forward it to the central government. Yours sincerely, Chen Guofu, December 12th, to the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Candidates Support the President's Instructions, Party Department Tea Party Discusses Election Matters</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, Fang Zhi, the chairman of the Kuomintang City Party Department, gathered all the Kuomintang National Assembly representative candidates in this city at the City Party Department to hold a tea party to discuss election matters. Chairman Fang delivered a speech stating: 1. The candidates of our party should absolutely abide by the law. 2. The candidates of our party should assist each other. 3. We must do our best to assist the candidates of friendly parties and support their election. Finally, Chairman Fang read the telegram from the President to Chairman Fang and Mayor Wu regarding election instructions. All the candidate comrades were moved after listening to it, and sincerely expressed that they unanimously accepted the President's instructions. The tea party ended satisfactorily at about 5:00 pm.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Kidnapped and Almost Killed</h3>

<h3>Fraudulent Marriage Case: Ju Guangzao's Initial Trial; Denies Abducting Gu Guohua's Wife, Claims Gold Loan Was Only as a Guarantor</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Ju Guangzao, who, under the guise of doing business, seduced women from good families and defrauded them of their property, was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for interfering with marriage and fraud. Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, the Second Criminal Court of the District Court, presided over by Judge Zhong, began the trial. Yang Dingxiuyun testified first: "Thirty-six years old, from Wuxi, residing at 521 Fuxing Middle Road, a friend of Liu Shen Liying for over ten years. I know Ju Guangzao through Liu's introduction. At the end of last year, Ju said he urgently needed 'funds' and was willing to use land deeds as collateral for a loan.</p>
<p>With me as guarantor,</p>
<p>I asked Chen Luzhangying to lend him fifty taels of pure gold. It was delivered to Ju on December 30th. Because Ju couldn't produce the land deeds, he mortgaged three and three-tenths mu of land on Haifang Road under my name. The intermediary was Liu Shen Liying, who stated that it would be returned in two months. After the due date, Ju delayed payment. In March of this year, I managed to scrape together twenty taels to repay part of Chen's loan. Ju's land deeds were given to me as collateral. Afterwards, I repeatedly asked him</p>
<p>to return the gold,</p>
<p>twenty taels. He always claimed he had no money. Until August, he suddenly said, 'My friend Hu Gujianyi has returned from Taiwan. Last time he asked me to borrow gold, now he has spoken to Mrs. Wei, the wife of Chairman Wei of Taiwan Province, and Mrs. Wei is willing to lend him three thousand US dollars to repay it, but she needs collateral. Please give me the land deeds you have so I can exchange them for US dollars.' I believed him without a doubt and returned the land deeds. Who knew that when he was on trial, Guangzao (reported by this newspaper)</p>
<p>would disappear,</p>
<p>and the US dollars have not been seen to this day." Following her, Shen Liying testified about the gold loan, which was the same as what Yang Dingxiuyun stated. Xu Zhaoqi, who knew the details of the loan, testified about what he saw regarding the loan, and said, "Ju Guangzao and Liu Shen Liying are cohabiting and have been for three years. Their second landlord also knows this." Furthermore, according to Gu Chengshi, the mother of Gu Guohua, Ju abducted her daughter-in-law Gu Su Tongjie and took away many gold ornaments. Finally, Ju Guangzao was brought in. Ju was quite tall, with a ruddy complexion, resembling a large merchant. He confessed, "I am from Fengxian, forty-three years old, and I don't know who Su Tongjie is. At the end of last year, I borrowed five gold bars from Yang Dingxiuyun on behalf of my friend Gu Jianyi. By April of this year,</p>
<p>I had returned two bars. The remaining three bars, along with the interest of one tael, five mace, and four fen, were deposited with the District Prosecutor's Office, totaling 15,139,200 yuan in national currency. Gu Jianyi is a real person and lives at the Maohe Rice Mill in Beiliuzao Town, Nanhui. Therefore, in this loan, I was only in the position of guarantor." At this point, the plaintiff Gu Guohua's lawyer presented a supplementary civil lawsuit for compensation, stating that the plaintiff and Su Tongjie were husband and wife. On March 19, 1944, Ju seduced the plaintiff's wife, absconded with her jewelry and cash, and lived with her as lovers. At that time, Su was seven months pregnant. Later she gave birth and named the child Da Liang, falsely claiming he was Ju's son. Now, he requests the court to grant a divorce and order him to compensate for the cost of the wedding banquet and mental distress, amounting to 300 million, and return the stolen property. Yang Dingxiuyun's lawyer also requested the court to order the recovery of thirty taels of pure gold and stated that Ju's statement that the gold bars were borrowed by Gu Jianyi was a blatant lie because they had sent a letter to the township head of Nanhui to investigate, and there was no such person as Gu Jianyi. At this point, the court ordered Ju Guangzao to post a 300 million yuan bail and adjourned the court, setting a date for a retrial.</p>

<h3>Misfortune of a Xiang Sheng Taxi Driver: Summoned to Drive, Robbed of Valuables</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At 10:55 PM the night before last, Xiang Sheng Taxi Company received a phone call from the Wuweizhai restaurant in the Great World amusement park, stating that a customer needed a taxi. The company dispatched driver Shen A'san in car number 20817. The customer was approximately 25 years old, wearing a black overcoat and a yellow uniform underneath, speaking with a local accent. After getting in the car, he immediately ordered the driver to go to Disiham Road, Tangen Road. Upon arriving at the destination, the customer suddenly pulled out a gun and asked if he had any cash on him. Shen was forced to hand over all the cash he had, amounting to 600,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, after receiving the money, the customer ordered Shen to drive to East Jiaxing Road. After crossing the bridge, he pointed the gun and forced Shen to stop the car, took off his watch, and ordered him to drive forward again. Upon reaching West Jiaxing Road, he stripped Shen of his woolen sweater and woolen vest. At this point, the customer wanted to force him out of the car. After Shen begged him to keep the car, the customer ordered him to drive to the intersection of Hong Kong Road and Huqiu Road, where he jumped out and fled with the stolen goods. The whole ordeal lasted about two hours. Afterwards, Shen reported the incident to the company, who then reported it to the North Sichuan Road Police Precinct, requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>"Flying Thief" Discovered in Wuxi; Stealing Skills Resemble "Yanzi Li San" of Beiping; Surprised by Beauty in the Black Night, Slapped in Anger</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 14th Dispatch] Recently, several major theft cases have suddenly occurred in the urban and rural areas of this county. Their method of theft is to often use electric poles to climb onto roofs and can jump freely between high-rise buildings. Last time, the police patrol team discovered the traces of these criminals on the roof of a resident's house in Qianxixi. They were about to encircle and arrest them, but they disappeared in an instant. Their theft can be called a "flying thief," similar to "Yanzi Li San" of Beiping. They also carry short guns when stealing, threatening the victims. The house of Hua Yifeng in Yucaie Lane, Shilangzhong Lane in the city, was suddenly visited by a thief at around 12:00 AM on the 7th of this month. He climbed up the electric pole in front of the house, first onto the roof of the neighbor Liu's house, and then sneaked into Hua's house along the wall. He pried open the bedroom door of Hua Zibinglun and stole a new Western-style suit and two handbags. He then searched in the back room of Hua's mother, but Hua's mother discovered him and turned on the light. The thief suddenly took out a pistol, forbade her from making a sound, and forced her to tell him where the gold was hidden. Then he searched and stole at will. Before leaving, he even drank a cup of boiled water. Afterwards, the Hua family checked their losses, which amounted to about tens of millions of yuan. At around 1:00 AM on the 12th, the thief came again to the house of a Gu family at 15 HuaiShu Lane, Xinsheng Road. Then he sneaked into the house of Ni Li's family at No. 14. All the residents in that house were women. Li's eldest daughter, Yuehua, was a beautiful young woman. The thief was surprised by her beauty. He wanted to commit indecency. The woman woke up from a dream and shouted for help. The thief, in anger, slapped Yuehua twice in the face and then fled. After leaving, he went to the Western-style house of a Zhao family at No. 18 in the same lane and stole a large amount of cash and gold. The security authorities are now dispatching personnel to investigate and arrest these thieves.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang's Autumn Harvest After Drought</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 13th Dispatch] According to pre-war statistics, Zhejiang Province can produce more than 84 million dan of rice every year, ranking sixth among the provinces in the country. Jiangnan is currently in the autumn harvest, and we naturally have endless concerns about this year's harvest in the country's sixth largest granary.</p>
<p>Early Rice and Late Rice Zhejiang has early and late rice varieties, and between the early and late rice, there are also earlier dry rice and later late rice, which completely depend on the season and the land. In Jiangnan (commonly known as Zhejiang West), spring flowers must be planted in the fields in spring, and spring silkworms must be raised. It is not until the spring flowers are harvested and the spring silkworms have spun their cocoons, usually in April or May, that they cultivate and plant rice. In southern or central Zhejiang, they do not plant spring flowers, and some places do not raise silkworms, so they cultivate and sow seeds early in the spring. In the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, relying on the mountains on one side and the sea on the other, they can only cultivate with the help of heaven. Because there are terraced fields on the mountains, small rains cannot reach the plains, and the mountain streams are blocked by the terraced fields. The water in the sea is salty and cannot be used for rice cultivation. Therefore, only with continuous rain in the spring and summer can they obtain a full harvest.</p>
<p>Fuyang and Quzhou Receive 90% of the Harvest This year's weather in Zhejiang was very dry, but because of the above-mentioned reasons, there were both good harvests and poor harvests, and some harvests were not enough to pay the taxes. The banks of the Fuchun River, Guanzhou River, and Quzhou River, however, had a bumper harvest this year. In all counties of Tonglu, Guanzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, Longyou, Tangxi, and Yunhe, the harvest was mostly above 90%. The reason is that in many of these counties, some do not plant spring flowers, some do not raise spring silkworms, and some rely on the irrigation of the Lan, Heng, and Fu three rivers. They had already harvested the dry rice during the dry midsummer.</p>
<p>Poor Harvest in Coastal Areas Coastal areas such as Zhenhai, Ningbo, Cixi, Dinghai, Wenling, Xiangshan, Leqing, Yuhuan, and Yongjia, although some do not plant spring flowers or raise spring silkworms, because of the relationship between the mountains and the sea, and because of the dry weather, there was no way to irrigate, so most of them had a poor harvest. A few days ago, a friend came from Xiangshan and said that some villages had almost no harvest at all. In such counties with poor harvests, it is of course difficult to pay taxes with the harvested grain. However, the townships and counties only know how to send telegrams saying that the drought is causing disasters, and they have not clearly investigated the specific facts and reported them. It is still necessary for the provincial level to send personnel to investigate, and then make a table to report it. As time drags on, this year's taxes will be due, and the tax reduction will be in the next year. How will this year's suffering be alleviated?</p>
<p>70% to 80% Harvest in the Jiahu Area This year, the Jiangnan area naturally also felt the drought, especially the Jiangnan farmers, who mostly plant spring flowers and raise spring silkworms. When they finish the above two tasks and go to cultivate rice fields, it is the time when the scorching sun is wreaking havoc and the rivers are drying up. Fortunately, there are many rivers and marshes in Jiangnan, and the farmers have done their best to rescue them. Many places have been saved. This year, the Jiahu area can harvest more than 70% and less than 80%. As for Hangzhou and Haining, they were originally very dry, but later, because the West Lake water was released, and the Qiantang River water was released before the Qiantang River tide, many were also saved. The reporter has roamed the great plains of Jiangnan and saw a look of joy on the faces of the farmers.</p>
<p>Ten Miles of Red Leaves in Haining When I went to Haining, I saw many farmers wearing some new clothes. Loads of white cotton were carried to the market, and fine nets of sugar cane were ready to be sold to fruit merchants. The temple on Xiaojian Mountain was thriving with incense. On the road, we could see groups of women, carrying incense baskets, wearing new clothes, and holding prayer beads, chanting with whispers. On the way to Haining, we saw red leaves on both sides of the road for ten miles, which was a spectacular sight. It is said that this year's cypress tree fruits are particularly good, so the red leaves are also particularly lush, which also proves a sign that Haining's rural areas are on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>Relying on Foreign Rice for Relief? I once asked the person in charge of the Zhejiang Provincial Land and Food Department how the harvest was this year. His answer was that it was probably 80% of last year's harvest. Obviously, this year is worse than last year.</p>
<p>Now, some people think: Anyway, foreign rice is coming, so it doesn't matter if our harvest is a little worse. I think this kind of dependence is not desirable. If we really rely on foreign rice for relief forever, we will not be a country. After this year's poor harvest, we should find a way to achieve a full harvest next year. How to achieve a full harvest? This requires the current government authorities and some agricultural experts to study a detailed plan. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<p>[Our dispatch] On the fourth day of the city games, a cold wind whistled, and the haze did not dissipate all day. The climate in the field was very cold, but the number of spectators did not decrease slightly, and the grand occasion remained. Starting at 9 a.m., the track and field events of the middle school boys' and girls' groups were held separately. The results were extremely satisfactory. In the afternoon, universities and colleges from fifteen units and the public group officially began the competition at the same time.

Wang Zhenglin's first place in the public group 1,500-meter final with a time of 4 minutes 24.7 seconds was particularly outstanding, exceeding the second place by almost a lap.

<h3>With Wind but No Dance, the Entire Venue Loses its Color; The Drum Corps' Sound Becomes a Memory, an Extremely Cool Sight</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] In the university group 1,500-meter final, Wang Zhonglin of the Municipal Sports College ran first, but unfortunately collapsed after reaching the finish line. After emergency treatment, he continued to vomit clear water. According to the doctor, this was due to excessive exercise and the symptoms of cerebral congestion.</p>
<p>During the preliminary round of the girls' 80-meter hurdles, several hurdles on the track were kicked over and scattered. One athlete kicked over four hurdles in the short 80-meter distance. Later, exhausted, she simply stopped jumping, pushed the hurdles over with her hands, and crossed over them, successfully reaching the finish line.</p>
<p>Someone in the field discovered that there were not many participants in the public group competition and had the idea of ​​speculating. They discussed that if there was a public group event where everyone was absent, they would immediately register temporarily, even if they walked slowly on the track, they could reach the finish line and win the championship and runner-up with ease.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, there was no more national gymnastics performance in the field. All that could be seen was the autumn wind sweeping the ground, and the sight was extremely cool, giving a sense of loneliness. Moreover, the sound of the drum corps outside the venue has become a memory, with only dozens of large flags from various schools whistling in the wind.</p>
<p>In the university men's javelin final, everyone's scores were initially very close and a stalemate ensued. In the end, Sun Huchao of the Municipal Sports College threw his arm out and broke through 41 meters, taking first place.</p>

<h3>Lianhua Team Wins 6-4 in a Close Match Against the Railway Team; Today's Second Match Against Qingbai</h3>
<p>The Malayan Lianhua Football Team played its first match in Shanghai against the local Railway Team at Yiyuan Stadium at 3 PM yesterday. Approximately 7,000 people, who had heard of their fame, came to watch, and 2,956 tickets priced at 25,000 yuan and 117 tickets priced at 50,000 yuan were sold. The usually deserted Yiyuan Stadium felt quite lively. As a result of the match, the visiting team took the lead 3-0 in the first half. The Railway Team launched a fierce counterattack in the second half, scoring four goals. In the end, the Malayan Lianhua Team won 6-4 against the Railway Team. The starting lineups for both sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Lianhua: Zhu Zhicheng, Chen Jiawan, Yang Jiasong, Huang Guodong, Li Yiyao, Wu Jincheng, Ye Qingrong, Xie Wenliang, Xia Tixian, Hu Wenxiang, Mei Runhua. Railway: Liao Xiong, Yue Renxiao, Xu Yuan, Huang Chunlin, Wu Jiabang, Cao Liming, Xiao Ziwen, Wu Binghao, Zhang, Lu Qingxiang, Lin Dianyi.</p>
<p>The visiting team's second match in Shanghai will be against the Qingbai Team starting at 3 PM today. The venue is still Yiyuan Stadium, and tickets are still priced at 25,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan. Presale tickets will be available at the Gymnasium starting at 12:30 PM. The entrance and exit of the stadium will be the same as yesterday. After the Lianhua Team narrowly defeated the Railway Team 6-4 yesterday, their skilled ball skills were fully demonstrated. However, apart from the center defender Li Yi, who was the most outstanding, the two halfbacks of the entire team were more scattered, and the goalkeeper's technique was not fully demonstrated. The five forwards attacked in a "W" formation, using the two inside forwards to dribble the ball back and the two wingers to surround the attack, which was unmatched by the Shanghai teams. Their individual ball skills were generally characterized by abundant endurance as their only excellent performance. Meeting the Qingbai Team today in order to maintain the reputation of the expeditionary force, the distribution of the lineup was discussed and announced last night, deciding to field the same lineup as yesterday's match. It is predicted that after yesterday's match, they will have an even more outstanding performance.</p>
<p>The Qingbai Team was the champion of the previous Shanghai First Division League. Their generals are all top-notch players. However, the three knights, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, and Fei Chunhua, remained in Hong Kong. They were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday, but they did not arrive. It remains uncertain whether they will arrive today, making the selection of players for today's match quite difficult. Moreover, Yan Shixin was injured in Hong Kong on the way back from the Hualian Team's expedition to Nanyang and has not yet recovered. He will not be able to play today. After careful arrangements by captain Xu Wenkui yesterday, it was announced that in addition to the existing good players, young players from Qingbai will be mixed and matched, so the strength is also considered strong. When they meet the visiting team, in order to demonstrate the power of the Shanghai League champion, they will definitely have an enthusiastic performance. According to a notice from the Qingbai Team, the players are required to gather at the Paramount Hotel before 1:30 PM today so that they can depart together. The Qingbai Team's lineup for today's match is as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai: Qin Bigao, Wu Kaimin, Wu Qixiang, Zhang Renyi, Qu Yong, Xie Qichuan, Xue Ran, Ha Zengming, Jin Sheng, Luo Shoufu, Li Yichen, Gao Xiuqing, Gu Yi, Jiang Ge Qing.</p>

<h3>Crackdown on Bounced Checks Has Achieved Considerable Results - Check Redemption Will Be Modified - Banks Will Select Customers Allowed to Redeem on the Same Day - The Ministry of Finance May Agree in Principle to This Recommendation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of cracking down on bounced checks, according to Director Li Lixia of the National Bank's Audit Department, the number of returned checks has decreased significantly recently. In the past, the amount of bounced checks often accounted for 5-6% of the total amount, but it has now been reduced to below 1%, which is a considerable achievement. It is impossible to completely eliminate bounced checks. The National Bank has drafted measures to crack down on bounced checks and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The content includes rectifying the existing customers of various banks, being particularly cautious when opening accounts, requiring introduction and guarantee by someone, and although the use of firm names or secret marks is still permitted, true names and detailed addresses must be retained for investigation. The reasons for bounced checks have also been clearly stipulated. For example, "contact with the drawer" etc. cannot be regarded as a reason to prevent banks from taking advantage of loopholes. At the same time, because same-day redemption of checks is not allowed, it conflicts with Shanghai customs and is indeed difficult in practice, which often leads to bounced checks. The National Bank has recently suggested to the Ministry of Finance a modified approach, whereby each bank will automatically select customers, some of whom will be allowed same-day redemption, and others who will be required to wait until the next day. Those allowed same-day redemption will have their customer list copied and stored in the Audit Department, and in the future, the bank will not be allowed to bounce checks of this type of customer on the same day on any pretext. Director Li also said that the Ministry of Finance is likely to agree to this recommendation in principle.</p>
<h3>Speculators Compete to Sell - Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Decline - Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Drops by 2 Million Yuan Compared to the Previous Day</h3>
<p>In the cotton yarn market, due to the excessive increase in prices the previous day, many speculators frequently sold. Furthermore, although the price allocation of the Textile Construction Company was increased, a large number of allocations were opened, and the capital of fellow traders was tight. Buyers were hesitant, and the market prices declined. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn returned to the 40 million yuan mark. The off-market price was shouting 39.5 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns also fell uniformly by 7-800,000 to more than 1 million yuan.</p>

After 9:30 AM, the inspection authorities arrived at the market to monitor, and people's hearts were even more panicked. Speculators competed to sell, and the market prices declined. By the end, various fine cloths such as 12-pound Longtou cloth fell by 23,000 to 45,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Serge and diagonal cloth had more supply than demand, and also fell by 15,000 to 45,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths were also more weak than firm.</p>
<p>Further News: The Textile Construction Company opened sales of cotton cloth as usual, totaling 38 types. The price of 20-count and 21-count unbranded fine cloth was 880,000 yuan, limited to cloth number applications.

<h3>Rice Prices Rise First and Then Fall Back - Oil Market Sees Mixed Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 13,800 shi of rice and grains arrived in the northern and southern markets. Each item wanted to rise but lacked strength, and all showed a trend of rising first and then falling back. Indica rice and Japonica rice opened very strong, but weakened at noon. As a result, they rose slightly by 3-5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Bai Yinyuan rice still had little ups and downs.</p>
<p>The same was true for flour, which was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, rising by 3-4,000 yuan. However, sales at the close were still sluggish. Chongqing and Hankou flour continued to arrive in Shanghai, and the source from Changzhou and Wuxi was not weak. The supply source was everywhere, and the trend was mediocre.

There were slight transactions from the Ningbo merchants, forming a situation where arrivals and sales were both enemies. The factory's supply source was abundant, and it did not rise.</p>
<h3>Adjustment Requested for Taiwan Sugar Allocation Price</h3>

<h3>Many Opportunities to Develop Export Trade to the United States - Liu Dajun Talks About the United States' Need for Local Products - Export Goods Should Meet US Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's US Correspondent] In recent months, importers and exporters in our country have felt the difficulty of foreign trade. This reporter happened to be in Washington, D.C., and interviewed Mr. Liu Dajun, our country's commercial counselor stationed in the United States. According to him, during the war, the US government had strict controls over the production and distribution of all aspects of industry and commerce. At the same time, overseas commercial transportation was cut off, so the US business community could not start trade with China. After the victory, the US business community actively restored and engaged in import and export business. Especially in the recent seven or eight months, many US businesses have asked this office to introduce Chinese merchants to contact import business, and there must be several cases every day. Among them, although many want to sell goods to our country, there are also many who want to purchase goods from our country. The items they intend to purchase, in addition to tung oil, raw silk, tea, and hog bristles, which are the main export items of our country, also include many other miscellaneous items. Even items such as bamboo poles, musk, and yarn-woven gloves want to find ways to purchase from our country. This office all introduces them based on the directory of Chinese commercial firms. At the same time, when importers and exporters in our country cannot directly contact US businesses to engage in buying and selling, they also send letters to this office for introduction. However, currently, the export commodities of our country often have disputes after arriving in the United States because they do not meet US standards, and there are not a few examples of those who have suffered losses because of this. Regarding this point, exporters in our country should pay close attention to it. Although importers and exporters in our country temporarily feel difficulties at present, if they can seek progress, the future will still be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Rise Slightly - Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Public bonds continued to rise slightly yesterday. Unified C bonds opened at 21,400 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 21,900 yuan and a low price of 20,800 yuan. Near noon, they were forced to close at a high price again, with only 4 million transactions. As a result, compared with the previous close, A and B bonds rose by 500 yuan, and C, D, and E bonds rose by 400 yuan each.</p>

<h3>Major Players Frequently Cut Sales - Chinese Stocks Close at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the general trend of Chinese stocks, Yongxing Spinning, was gone. Although there were struggles in the middle, the hearts of the people were completely lost, and it was difficult to last. It presented the highest opening and the lowest closing, and a big black line was the most tragic. The frequent sales of major players in the industry prevented the buying momentum of the young and strong factions and the Sichuan Road money changers from being effective. There were too many floating shorts, and there was a sign of disintegration near the close.</p>
<p>It was still stable at the earliest. Yongxing Spinning opened at a price of 308 yuan and 312 yuan, and then declined immediately, falling to an immediate delivery of 298 yuan and a forward delivery of 303 yuan. The off-market interest rate opened low to 1.5 jiao and 1.95 jiao. The capital was extremely rampant, and it was pulled up twice to an immediate delivery of 305 yuan and a forward delivery of 308 yuan. It was finally hindered by those who supplied it from time to time. Near noon, people's hearts were tired, and retail buyers were forced to sell due to time constraints. Yongxing Spinning fell to a low price of 296 yuan for immediate delivery and 300 yuan for forward delivery. Only Xinhua was still stable, Mei Ya fell less, and Zhabei was also peaceful. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Xinhua, Yonggong, Rongfeng, and Zhabei were still flat for immediate delivery stocks, China Cement rose slightly, Datong fell by 5%, and other stocks all suffered small setbacks. The prices of forward delivery stocks all fell slightly. Except for bank stocks, which rose by another 50% off-market, the rest saw both rises and falls.</p>
<h3>Capital Is Stable</h3>

<h3>Siamese Coup Affects Finance - Bangkok Great City Bank Goes Bankrupt</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air Mail] According to visitors who just returned to Hong Kong from Siam, after the Siamese coup, the market did not fluctuate except for slight fluctuations in gold prices. However, on the day of the coup (9th), the new government authorities, touting the liquidation of "wealthy family capital" as a slogan, announced that all checks issued by overseas Chinese Chen Hanchu (also known as Nai Lei) and others were to be stopped. It was found that Mr. Chen was the manager of the Bangkok Great City Bank. Since the new government announced the suspension of check use, a run on the bank occurred on the same day (9th). Because the bank could still cope that day, it was able to get through safely. However, the run situation became more crowded the next day (10th), and the bank could not cope, and it went bankrupt. The Asian Bank had the same situation as the Great City Bank. Fortunately, the new government canceled the order prohibiting the use of checks signed by the ten people on the previous day (11th), and it did not go bankrupt.</p>

If there are goods that are not listed on the export manifest, even if they are listed on the import manifest or transit manifest, they will be treated as "goods not listed on the manifest."</p>
<p>Paper Prices Are Stable</p>
<p>The paper market has stabilized since the Supervision Committee and the Guild thoroughly investigated hoarding. The Paper Industry Guild, in order to correct the tea house market transactions and prevent illegal colleagues from disrupting market prices, specifically stipulates that the purchase and sale of white paper in the market must be in accordance with the limited price of 850,000 yuan per ream, and must not exceed the limit. Therefore, after the tea house market was restored in the previous week, the prices of various papers were very stable.</p>
<p>Dark-Colored Woolen Fabrics Are Active</p>
<p>The woolen fabric market remained stable yesterday. In fact, the selling price could not fall, and the rise was weak. Both buyers and sellers had a take-it-or-leave-it attitude towards transactions. Except for those with real strength and those with sales needs, most of them held a more static than active attitude. However, dark-colored fancy wools, serge, and other trends are quite active.</p>

<p>For daily necessities, soap, the gatekeepers were strong buyers, and the solid-based Arrow and Knife soaps rose by 5,000 yuan alone, while the rest weakened.</p>
<h3>Rayon Market Softens - Factory-Woven Silk Goods All Fall Yesterday</h3>
<p>The rayon market was very soft yesterday. People's hearts were unusually panicked, and floating shorts cut their losses, causing the market to fall as soon as it opened. 120-count Asahi 1A glossy had transactions at 3 million yuan for immediate delivery, and the minimum reached 2.5 million yuan. The price for the Monday period was shouted at 4 million yuan for purchase and 5 million yuan for sale.

<h3>Casual Chat on "Mr."</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>A few years ago, in a vocational school in western Hunan, there was a female worker named Yang Sao, who always omitted one word when addressing the teacher Zhou, directly calling him Zhou Xian(sheng). Hearing this was very harsh and felt disrespectful. Little did she know that the title of "Mr." could be referred to by just one character, as it has been since ancient times. Without reading more history and knowing more about past actions, it is truly impossible to know people and discuss the world, and it is inevitable to be criticized for being ignorant and making a mountain out of a molehill. According to Zhao Xian's Notes on the Twenty-Four Histories: "In ancient times, the word 'Mr.' could be referred to as 'Xian' or 'Sheng'. Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian - Biography of Chao Cuo: Cuo initially studied under Zhang Hui Xian. The History of the Han Dynasty says: He initially studied under Zhang Hui Sheng. One calls him 'Xian', one calls him 'Sheng'. Yan's commentary says: Both are 'Mr.'. Also, Biography of Chao Cuo: School Commandant Deng Gong and all the officials called him Deng Xian. Yan's commentary also said: Deng is 'Mr.'. Biography of Mai Yu: Yu asked for his bones due to old age. Emperor Yuan issued an edict saying: I, Sheng, have the integrity of Boyi and the straightness of Shiyu. Shi Gu's commentary says: 'Sheng' refers to 'Mr.'. Mei Fu wrote a letter saying: Uncle Sun Xian was not disloyal. Shi Gu also commented: 'Xian' refers to 'Guangsheng'. This shows that in ancient times, 'Mr.' could be referred to as 'Xian' or 'Sheng', and it was not necessary to use both characters."</p>
<p>Yang Sao is just a maidservant. She initially did not know that "Mr." could be referred to as "Xian" or "Sheng", but she happened to coincide with ancient customs. If we, who call ourselves scholars, rashly laugh at her, we will inevitably be laughed at by those who study ancient times and understand knowledge. When criticizing and judging, shouldn't we be cautious? However, "Mr." today cannot be referred to as "Xian" or "Sheng".</p>

<h3>The Wonderful Use of Facial Makeup</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>According to theater critics, the wonderful use of facial makeup in old dramas lies in emphasizing the plot and expressing the characters' personalities. For example, a tiger is painted on the forehead of a brave general, a turtle is drawn on the nose of a clown, loyal ministers have red faces, treacherous officials have white faces, and the facial makeup of heroic outlaws is colorful. In this way, the audience can clearly see the loyalty, treachery, good, and evil of the characters in the play, which also facilitates the actors' expressions and makes the plot easier to deepen.</p>
<p>Another wonderful use of facial makeup is to let the actors know that when they are painting their faces in the dressing room, they are preparing to go on stage to perform. They should abandon their own personalities and adopt the personalities of the characters in the play. They should use the colors of red, yellow, blue, white, and black to conceal their true faces and fully express the plot of the drama. When performing, the brave general with a tiger painted on his face, in order to make the performance realistic, can fight and scold the colorful heroic outlaws, fighting to the death and turning the world upside down, fighting for three hundred rounds without a winner or loser. The charming and beautiful actress with a powdered face can flirt with the young master, hook the arms of the young playboy, and exchange glances in the back garden. The clown with a turtle painted on his nose, seeing this, can crawl back and forth between the actress's legs, sniffing to see what it smells like... Anyway, all of these actions are crystal clear in the minds of the actors and in the eyes of the audience: "We are acting, you are watching."</p>
<p>But when the play is over, or when this scene has come to an end, everyone wipes off their facial makeup and reveals their true faces, and walks off the stage peacefully. Everyone is originally a colleague in the same troupe. In a play, the protagonist is certainly important, but even those who wave flags and shout and play minor roles cannot be underestimated. Therefore, everyone can respect and value each other and maintain a friendly atmosphere. The red-faced and colorful-faced actors who were fighting and scolding on the stage just now are now still talking and laughing, and reconciling. Because the play is over, everyone has wiped off the colors on their faces and walked off the stage. Even the actress who was flirting with the young master on the stage has also wiped off the makeup on her face and acts as if nothing happened. She also has self-awareness, knowing that she was not showing off her charm just now, but expressing the plot in the drama.</p>
<p>Engaging in politics is also acting. The characters on the political stage are the same as the actors on the stage. To make politics good—that is, to make the play on the political stage look decent—when going on stage, one inevitably has to put on various facial makeup, such as tigers and turtles, to make the performance realistic, or to make a real performance appear fake. However, when getting off the stage and wiping off the tigers and turtles on their faces, they must respect and value each other, be peaceful, and maintain sincere friendship. If the actors on the stage do not recognize the difference between on stage and off stage, and always wear red, yellow, blue, white, and black facial makeup, whether on stage or off stage, and never wipe off the tigers and turtles on their faces, fighting on stage and fighting off stage, scolding on stage and scolding off stage, then they will never be able to coordinate, and regardless of whether the play is fake or real, they will never be able to perform well.</p>
<p>The characteristic of modern democratic politics is that, when going on stage, one can see from the facial makeup of each actor what party you belong to and what faction I belong to. When getting off stage, everyone can automatically wipe off the tigers and turtles on their faces, and everyone acknowledges that they are colleagues in the same troupe. The fighting and scolding on stage is not to fight for emotional reasons or to seize power, but to put on a good play and win the sympathy and support of the audience.</p>
<h3>Partridge Sky</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>The person in charge of the paper statistics office of the police station said: The number of suicide cases in Shanghai in October exceeded the record for each month of this year. Those who committed suicide by taking Lysol accounted for seven-tenths, and the Xiao Dan Gui case was the most sensational.</p>
<p>Suicides increase, Gui stands alone fragrant, taking Lysol to break the liver and intestines; the statistics are shocking, exceeding the previous month, all because people fear suffering!</p>

<h3>Talking about Shuangqing</h3>
<p>— Wu Jianming</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw Mr. Baili's article "Superimposed Characters and Rambling Photography," in which he mentioned the rural woman Shuangqing, who filled "Remembering the Flute on Phoenix Terrace" with superimposed characters throughout the text, which was vivid and well-organized. It is a pity that her surname was not allowed to be mentioned. According to Shuangqing's surname is He, her given name is Qiubi, and she was a native of Danyang in the Qing Dynasty. She was intelligent and talented from a young age. During the Yongzheng period, she was the wife of a farmer named Zhou in Jinsha Xiaoshan. Unfortunately, she met an unvirtuous man, died with regret, and wrote "Poems and Lyrics of Xueya Pavilion." "Baiyuzhai Ci Hua" says: "Shuangqing had extraordinary talent and unparalleled beauty. She was a farmer's wife. Her mother-in-law was mean and her husband was violent. She died from overwork. She did not want to leave any ink marks in her lifetime's poems and lyrics. She always wrote with chalk on reed leaves, because chalk is easy to fall off and leaves are easy to rot." Huang Yunfu said, "Shuangqing's lyrics are like those of little children, murmuring and chattering, telling about everyday life, seeing and hearing, thinking and thinking, writing in detail, and being thorough in everything. The author does not consider it poetry, and the reader also considers it poetry, but the emotions are real and the intentions are sincere. Isn't this natural? Isn't this a miracle? However, the poverty she encountered was unprecedented among talented women in ancient times. Every time I recite it, I don't know where my tears come from." What I have seen also includes "Bo Xing," "Touching Fish," and "Regretting the Slow Pace of Yellow Flowers," all of which are sad and moving. She is truly a talented woman of her generation.</p>
<h3>Jottings by Lamplight: Liu Yuanchuan and His Retainers</h3>
<p>— Feng Ren</p>
<p>"When Lin'an was about to fall, Wen Tianxiang said to his staff: 'The situation has come to this, what should we do?' A retainer said: 'A ball of blood.' Wen said: 'Why?' The retainer said: 'When you die, we will all die with you.' Wen smiled and said: 'Do you know Liu Yuanchuan of the past? He was intimate with a prostitute, and their love was deep. They expected to grow old together. The prostitute refused guests and devoted herself to Liu. Liu passed the imperial examination and was appointed an official. The prostitute wanted to go with him to take office, but Liu was worried about it. So he lied and said: 'I am willing to die with you and will never go alone.' Then he placed poison in wine and ordered the prostitute to drink it first. He drank half of it himself, but he didn't drink any more. The prostitute died, and Liu left alone. Today, are you all going to imitate Liu Yuanchuan?' The retainers all laughed loudly."</p>
<p>Although we did not see how Wen Tianxiang's staff laughed, that expression is not difficult to imagine. The master's smile and the guests' laughter formed a wonderful contrast, which contained a lot of human warmth! Unexpectedly, Wen Tianxiang would be so humorous, and a few jokes would hook out the hearts of his retainers. So, everyone "knew what was in each other's minds" and could only laugh it off and disperse. This laughter was like self-deprecation and like applause. The technique was good, but that awkwardness could not be concealed.</p>
<h3>Birds Flying in Water</h3>
<p>— Lin Mei</p>
<p>All birds mostly fly in the sky. Only a few birds wade in the water, and some swim in the water. To find birds that can fly in the water, no one has ever seen them. However, there are many strange things in the world. Just as there is a kind of flying fish that can fly out of the water, it is only natural that birds flying in the sky can also fly in the water. This kind of bird that flies in the water is called a "river bird" because its nest is built behind waterfalls, so people don't easily see it, and thus don't know that there is a kind of bird that flies in the water.</p>
<p>The river bird's habitat is mostly near waterfalls. It uses moss to build a round nest, which is usually located behind the waterfall below the mountain rock. This place is inaccessible to ordinary birds. Its nest has a small opening on one side. When it flies back, it often passes through the waterfall.</p>
<p>The larvae flowing down in the rapid current are their food. Some of these larvae live under the rocks in the stream, and some rush along in the rapid water. River birds often dive into the water to find food. If they find a small worm rushing past in the rapid current, they will follow behind the worm, flapping their wings, and chase after it in the water. Their feet do not have webs like ducks, so they cannot swim in the water. They fly in the water just like they do in the air.</p>
<p>The world is so big, there are really all kinds of wonders. People who study zoology know that there are such birds, but after all, there are not many people who study zoology, so many people either don't believe it or feel strange about it.</p>
<h3>Leaders of Two Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>After Qian Shouzhai married Liu Rushi, he loved her like a goddess. He built a separate mansion for her to live in, and named her room "I Heard," taking the meaning of "Thus Have I Heard" from the Diamond Sutra. One day, he took her to visit Tiger Hill. Muzhai was wearing a small-collared and large-sleeved garment. He met a scholar who bowed to him and asked what kind of clothing this was. Muzhai said, "The small collar is the official dress of the new dynasty, and the large sleeves are to show that I have not forgotten the previous dynasty." The scholar pretended to change his expression and said, "You serve the new dynasty, but you still do not forget the old country. Your intentions are good. You can truly be called a leader of two dynasties!" Muzhai was very embarrassed.</p>
<p>According to Qian Qianyi, as the Minister of Rites, in an emergency, he did not flee with Hongguang, but surrendered to the enemy in Nanjing together with Grand Scholar Wang Duo and Governor Yue Qijie. He served the enemy with a servile face. Even now, he still says that he has not forgotten the previous dynasty. He is shamelessly old and refuses to die. If history allows, he can be compared with Feng Dao, the veteran of five dynasties. However, although Feng Dao served nine emperors, judging from his claim that he was a "foolish old man with no virtue or talent" (according to Feng Dao served the Khitans and朝耶律德光.德光asked: "What kind of old man are you?" He replied: "An old man with no virtue or talent, a foolish old man."德光was happy and appointed him as Grand Tutor), he still had some self-awareness. Therefore, he just muddled along as an official and ate his meals throughout his life. He did not dare to show off. Compared to Qian Qianyi, who willingly served the enemy and still wanted to fish for fame and call himself refined, he was slightly better.</p>
<h3>Bernays Reveals: Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>Also, judging from the official documents from Sato, the Japanese ambassador to Moscow, to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he was a pragmatic and capable diplomat. He informed the Japanese government that the documents he received were too vague in nature and that the Soviet government would not consider them. Assuming that they were only based on beautiful words and had no substance, they would not be persuaded. It would be futile to waste time trying to probe the Soviet government's intentions unless Japan was prepared to surrender. Since the Soviet Union insisted on the unconditional surrender of Germany in the past, she would of course comply with the unconditional surrender of Japan proposed by Britain and the United States. Sato said that he knew that his views were contrary to the emperor's wishes, but even if he "deserved to die ten thousand times," "I still want to save millions of lives that would die in vain." He further emphasized, "Japan has no other choice but to surrender unconditionally."</p>
<p>If the Japanese government could really listen to Sato's words and surrender unconditionally, it would not have been necessary to drop the atomic bomb. However, the warlords were still dreaming of peace negotiations and ignored Sato's faithful advice. On July 21, the Japanese government instructed its diplomatic representative in Moscow: "Under no circumstances can we accept unconditional surrender. Even if the war is prolonged and more blood is shed, under the enemy's demand for unconditional surrender, we will follow the emperor's orders and fight the enemy to the last soldier."</p>
<p>The Japanese government no longer contacted the Soviet Union through Switzerland or Sweden, but directly, in order to notify the Soviet Union that they were prepared to fully accept all of the Soviet Union's demands in the Far East. They hoped that by agreeing to the Soviet Union's demands, they could get help in the peace talks. They also hoped to use such discussions to find out whether the Soviet Union would participate in the war.</p>
<p>It was not until after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima that the Japanese cabinet decided to surrender. According to the records of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on August 10, the Soviet ambassador to Tokyo informed Tojo that the Soviet Union had signed the Potsdam Declaration and was at war with Japan. Tojo then gave the Soviet ambassador a copy of the document requesting that Switzerland forward it to the United States, stating that Japan was willing to accept the surrender except for maintaining the Japanese emperor's rule.</p>
<p>Japan's surrender was faster than we had expected, but we were prepared for it. The State Department, the Army, and the Navy jointly formed a committee to prepare for the general orders for handling the surrender and occupation. A thorny issue arose, which was who should accept Japan's surrender? The great powers all agreed that General MacArthur was qualified to represent them and the United States to accept the surrender. But the Navy objected to this. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal summarized their views as: the Navy was the backbone of the Pacific war, and the naval officers and soldiers had been fighting from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo, island by island; they had destroyed the Japanese Navy. Therefore, MacArthur could sign the surrender document for the United Nations, and Admiral Nimitz should sign on behalf of the United States. I agreed with Forrestal's theory that the Navy should also participate in the event and promised to find a way to do everything. That night, Forrestal suggested by telephone that the ceremony to accept Japan's surrender be held on the battleship "Missouri." I deeply understood that this was the Navy's so-called "Army trick." If he had just said "a battleship," there would have been more debate on the issue. But since he mentioned Missouri, I knew the matter was resolved. When the president received this suggestion, naturally, he thought it was the best idea. In this way, a matter of contention between the Army and the Navy was finally resolved smoothly!

<h3>Surplus Military Rice to Aid Refugees</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: All the volunteer soldiers of our team have accumulated more than 500 catties of surplus military rice under the food allowance for more than a month in the team. After a full resolution, it was decided to transfer the donation to aid disaster victims in order to show our sympathy. In particular, we would like to ask your newspaper to transfer the donation to the refugee relief organization. However, the volunteer soldiers have all been assigned to the Armored Corps School and the 208th Division of the Youth Army, and our team cannot notify them one by one. We also ask your newspaper to publish this notice as a substitute. If we are allowed to do so, we will be most grateful. Sincerely yours, Jiang Quanrui, captain of the 9th company of the 2nd recruit battalion of the Shanghai Garrison District.</p>

<p>Coat to be Claimed Mr. Editor: I came to Shanghai from Beijing by express train on the 11th and arrived at the station at 4:30 in the afternoon. When I got off the train, I found a coat left in the carriage. I took it down, raised it high, and shouted all the way to the exit of the station, but no one came to claim it. So I took it back and temporarily stored it at Demin Yixiao Private School, Room 305, 3rd Floor, 209 Shandong Road. Please publish it in your newspaper and hope that the owner will come to claim it as soon as possible! The Teaching Affairs Office of Demin Yixiao Private School</p>

<h3>One of the Social Service Works of Zhongbao: Qingxia Relief Fund for the Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick</h3>
<p>The 17th application deadline is the 17th - donations are welcome</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. The Qingxia Relief Fund has been around for 16 months from the beginning of July last year until now. In this year or so, we have issued 16 relief funds one after another. Assuming that each time we have helped 10 people, that is to say, we have helped 160 suffering compatriots.</p>
<p>Although our strength is so weak, we always want to use donations from all walks of life to give sympathy and comfort to poor compatriots who are suffering. At the same time, it can also make them feel that they have not been completely forgotten in this cold and ruthless society, which may make them feel the meaning of life again and encourage new courage. Thanks to the continuous donations from sponsors and sympathizers, our relief work can continue to continue, but because of currency changes and the increasing number of applicants, we have felt many difficulties. To overcome these difficulties, we need more support from enthusiastic sponsors and sympathizers.</p>
<p>It's getting cold, and suffering compatriots are eagerly waiting for help. Dear readers, please help as soon as possible (please send donations to the Social Service Department of Shenbao).</p>
<p>(The deadline for the 17th application is set for the 17th. From the 18th, the 18th application will begin. All poor compatriots can write an application letter, ask the head of the bao or jia to certify it, find a guarantor, and send it to this column for review. If they are qualified, they will be given appropriate assistance.)</p>
