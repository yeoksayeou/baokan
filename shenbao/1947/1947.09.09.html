<h3>職團選舉國代及立委　嚴格審核候選人　社部電各省市力杜冒濫</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日〕此次大選，職業團體應選名額，業經公佈，關於國大代表及立法委員之職業人選，據社會部發言人鄭車吿記者：該部希望此次選出之國大代表及立法委員，均爲各業眞正從業人員，使各該業之意見，能反映於今後國家之政策，以充分表現民主政治之精神，該部業已通電各省市，對於職選國代及立委候選人，應嚴格審核，力杜冒濫，必須鼓勵各業眞正從業人參加競選，對於農工尤應注意，俾能杜絕一般官吏及與農工毫無關係之份子，濫竿混雜。</p>
<h3>工商團體名額</h3>
<p>職團及婦婦女選委會</p>
<p>電催國府速作決定</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕全國性職業團體及婦女團體選舉事務所選舉委會，於今日下午四時假社會部舉行第三次會議，出席委員黃友郢，蔣作屏，童肖予等，由谷主席委員正綱主席，決議要案如次：（一）職業團體名額詳細分配辦法，雖經政府公布，但其中工商業團體部份。則因名額問題，迄未決定增加分配公布，對於整個職選進行，頗有影響，再電請總所，迅催國府速作決定。（二）總所檢送關於選舉程序問題之補充釋明，規定選舉人名册及選舉權證，國大代表與立委通用辦理，不無困難，因兩種選舉法規定，有二個以上遝舉權者，得自行擇定一種，是參加國大代表及立委之區域選舉或職業選舉，應許其自行認定，如在國大代表選舉時，參加職業選舉，至立委選舉時參加區域選舉，則選舉人必多變更，且國大代表與立委選舉，造册日期相距兩月，其間因會員適齡之屆滿，及團體之增减，會員數與團體數復多變更，二者選舉人名册自未便通用，仍應分造，至參加職業選舉人之選舉權證，如國大選舉，立委選舉時，參加區域或職團，或婦團，互有變更時，應由選舉人申請當地申請機關，加蓋戳記，方能適用用。（三）職業團體及婦女團體，全國性選舉立委及國大代表候選人之登記，依法僅繳呈候選人提名簽署書，其審查則以選舉人名册爲憑，此項名册，按選舉罷免法施行條例第九條，均規定由各主管選舉機關分別造具二份，一份呈上級主管機關備查，關於全國性團體選舉事務，係由各縣市選舉事務所辦理，除直轄市外，選舉機關均爲三級，若選舉人名册分呈本所備查，則縣市即須具三份，於條例是否相合，事實上有無困難，均成問題，決定不再多造一份名册，層轉全國性職婦選所。惟爲便於審查起見，對於候選人登記審查手續，作一補充規定，以憑核對，其辦法如次：一，國大代表及立法委員候選人，申請登記時，除繳呈候選舉人提名簽署書外，並應繳騐本人會員證及從業證明文件。二，凡在企國性職婦選所登記者，其候選人及簽署人是否符合規定，由該所按其所屬團體，分別開列名單，分交各省市選所查對具報。凡在各省市選所登記者，其簽署人除屬於本省市者自行核對函報該所外，其屬於他省市者，由辦理登記之選所分別開列名單，分送其他各省市選所查對，逕報該所。三，候選人所屬團體之省市選所，於業報候選人名單時，應將查對候選人情形塡明，並加註意見。（四）鐵路，海員，鹽業，鑛業，公路，及電信工會係不分行政區域組織之工會，其國大及立委均係全國合選，惟此項特種工會，如鐵路工會，公路工會，均以各該路綫爲組織區域，鹽業工會，鑛業工會，亦均以各該鹽塲鑛區爲組織區域，此與一般工會旣有不同，其選舉事項，除應依據兩選舉泆施行條例，暨職業團體及婦女團體選舉注意事項之規定辦理外，尙有予以補充規定必要，藉利選務進行，補充注意事項如左：一，凡鐵路，海員，鹽業，鑛業公路及電信工會，其組織區域跨越縣市者，選務事務（包括選舉人名單之編造公吿、選舉權證之發給，及投票開票）由各該工會支部，或小組所在地之選舉機關辦理，其組織區域在縣市以內者，由會所所在地選舉機關辦理。二，跨越縣市之工會，其支部或小組，應將各該支部或小組之會員，願參加職業一選舉者。縣市以內之公會，應將該公會會員願參加職業選舉者，分別造册，送當地選舉機關，於開票後，應開列得票人名單票數公告之，並報由各該省選所，轉送全國性職婦選所，棠　計公吿之，並決定其當選人及候補人。（五）職業團體及婦女團體選舉票色·紙·字·及說明，經依照社會部頒佈職業團體選出名額詳細分配辦法，重行訂定，報請總所備案，並通飭遵行。</p>
<h3>防止華南走私　輸出入會設華南分會　張嘉璈四中全會後赴穗視察</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕中樞爲防止華南走私及僑匯逃避，特由輸出入管理委會籌設華南分會，負責人遠業由該會呈請政院派定廣州行轅代表朱暉日爲主委，副主委則調派四聯總處秘書田定庵兼任，田氏八日晨由滬返京，摒擋公務，幷向中樞請示後，定九日赴滬轉穗。據田氏稱：華南進出口走私及僑匯逃避情形，正如人體生瘤，如不割除，將危害整個生命，近來朝野對此甚爲重視，政府在此財政，經濟革新時期，對華南猖獗私運情形，當從積極與消極着手，嚴密限制。華南分會係由中央與地方有關機關所組織，港方亦允儘力協助，今後互相協助推進，可使輸出入貿易及僑匯情形趨於正常，藉以杜塞漏巵。又悉訊：張嘉璈四中全會後，將赴穗督視工作執行。</p>
<h3>日賠償工廠　即將開始拆遷</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕日賠償我國之先期拆遷工廠，計五十四個整廠，其中分配資委會者有廿個整廠，其拆遷程序，擬先拆機電，次造船，再次鋼鐵，現機電拆遷即將開始，我國擬派赴日本拆遷工作人員，共計二二三團名。</p>
<h3>配合節約消費　謀生產合理化　全經委會正擬訂辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕全經會頃正就配合節約消費辦法，爲生產機構擬訂一生產合理化辦法。社會部谷部長今語記者稱：吾人目前亟宜展開一生產合理化之運動，惟此項工作良非易易，因我國向不重工廠管理，而管理之對象如機器環境均未予研討，致使各廠標凖不能相同，吾人如欲使生產合理化，自須從根本改良。谷氏末表示：甚盼此項辦法能有良好之收獲。記者繼請談關於節約消費辦法之意見，是否可能收當年英國定量分配之效果？渠答以辦法固甚良好，惟不可與英國同日而語，因英國一切物質均自外輪入，政府有全力可控制，與我國物資星散者不同，而英人係以犯法爲恥，守法爲美德者，中國則反是，故推行時自不免略有麻煩，尙盼言論界能造成風氣，改良此種積習，以達成節約消費之目的。又悉：各機關之人員裁减，用品登記事項，正由各機關趕辦預算中，即可送政院核定。</p>
<h3>政院第廿次會通過　設善後事業委會　繼聯總行總完成復興農業大計劃　專利法後年元旦施行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕政院新聞局長董顯光，就本日政務會議通過設立善後事業委會一事，發表談話如下：因聯總·行總即將結束，而聯總給束後，原定之善後專業長期計劃，非數年不克完成者，如黃汎區復興工作，漁業善後，機耕及農具製造暨鄕村工業示範等項，經行總聯總協力行，已奠立相當基礎，我政府爲完成此項未完事業，以竟全功特組織該會，隸屬於行政院，其意義甚爲重大，會以下設籌議保管委會，其組成份子爲三方面：（一）政府代表，（二）國內負有社會聲望老人土，（三）聯總或聯合國所辦類似機構所推荐之人士，此不止爲我國政府重視聯總未完成計劃之表示，且亦爲國際合作之新辦法。由我政府自動倡導，而爲接受聯總物資其他國家所無，即在我行政系統完整之前提下，使捐助國家得一合作協助完成計劃之機會，實爲一新的試騐。善後事業委會之主要業務，爲農業復興大計劃，不僅我政府特別注意推動，亦爲國際關心人士所樂觀其成，其要點在此一計劃完成時，將對多數人民增進不少利益，蓋非此不足以言復興也。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕政院第廿次政務會議，因四中全會九日開幕，特提前於八日下午三時舉行，張院長主席，出席委員廿餘人，茲擇載決議要案如次：（一）工業會法通過。（二）修正遺產稅法，交全國經濟委員會審議。（三）專利法定卅八年一月一日起施行。（四）社會部工礦檢察處組織條例修正通過，送立法院，經費部份照預算審查委員會審查意見通過。（五）粵省水災堵搶工款，（六）追加隴海鐵路徐海段搶修工款，（七）河南省政府請撥剿匪費，（八）河南省政府請撥學生救濟費案，均通過。（九）衛生持術人員特別津貼，照原標準增加爲五倍。（十）中央教育機關醫藥衛生人員技術津貼案，　審查意見通過。（十一）各縣市參議會參議員任期延長至縣市議會成立時爲止。</p>

<h3>靑年黨執檢委　選出一百廿人</h3>
<p>全代大會昨日閉幕</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年黨全國代表本會昨閉幕，昨日上下午均進行選舉，經選出執行委員九十九人，檢察委員廿一人，合計中委一百廿人。關於「黨政權限劃分」一節，據發言人解釋：此事不擬作硬性之規定，而僅爲不成文之諒解。即從政黨員在政府內負有實際責任者，不再在黨內負繁重之責任，但仍擔任常委。新中常委之名額，亦將因中委人數之增加而提高，將定爲十五人至十九人。又常乃　府委遺缺之候補人，亦將由當會決定。</p>
<h3>新加坡的黨派鬥爭</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　吳嘉棠</p>
<p>—隨中航機視察南洋追記之四</p>
<p>談到南洋各地的黨派分歧和團結力的缺乏，可拿新加坡作代表。除開國民黨，民主同盟和共產黨的活動以外，帮口的四分五裂，幾乎亦有丈二和尙摸不着頭腦之感。</p>
<p>戰後，「馬共」的勢力，日見澎漲，幾乎控制了整個馬來亞。唯一的原因是馬來亞在淪陷時期，共產黨利用這個時機，組織了「人民抗日軍」，普遍發動了地下工作，因此獲得了英人供給的槍械；同時又在日軍手中奪得一部份武器。於是漸漸地成了一支有武裝有力量的軍隊。雖然在勝利之後，英人重新回到了馬來亞，幾次三噃的想從「馬共」手中收回槍械，但是結果散失在馬來亞北部的爲數仍多，到現在爲止，英人依然毫無辦法。</p>
<p>目前「馬共」的外圍，有「新民主靑年團」和一抗日義勇軍支部」兩個組織，這是由「馬共」領袖張明今所領導的。在勝利初期，英人將到未到的一個時期內，「馬共」曾經想利用這個千載一時的機會控制整個的僑胞社會，更以强迫的手段，企圖禁止僑胞懸掛國旗，而規定必須一律褂蘇聯旗，和他們「馬共」的三色旗。但是「馬共」沒有料想到當時人心旺盛，僑胞對祖國的信心甚大。因而弄巧成拙，不但沒有發生效果，反而失去了人心。這一件事在當時「馬共」的看法：認爲是精神上一個致命的打擊。</p>
<p>但是話又要說回來，「馬共」在最近的二年內，又利用了英國工黨當政，在民主自由空氣的環境下，漸漸地又抬起了頭，他們在各工會中的活動，控制了一切的幕後工作，拿近來馬來亞的一般工潮來看，都是有「馬共」在幕後作支援，他們不但替工潮做宣傳，更以大量金錢作後盾。</p>
<p>不過到現在爲止，「馬共」雖然沒有一張報紙，可是巧妙地利用了民盟的機關報「南僑日報」，簡接的作爲他們的傳聲筒。而「民盟」却是相反的，雖然有張機關報整天的大呌大喊，可是並沒有實際的力量，據一般人的佔計：在馬來亞的民盟人員不過一百多人。如果一定要明白民盟勢力有多少大的話，我們可以從陳嘉庚的談話中，得到一個梗槪，在記者與陳嘉庚的會談中，陳嘉庚曾經那樣的說：「民盟雖然有聲望，有地位，但是沒有力量，有時候祗能隨聲附和而已」陳嘉庚本人在新加坡是口口聲聲的反對政府的，在談吐之中，可以看得出這位老人的意見固執，對國內政治仍舊保持他的主觀的看法。雖然他在抗戰期內，曾經回到祖國的大後方，並到過延安，但是仍不能了解國內一般的政治情形。</p>
<p>記者會經問陳嘉庚：海外僑胞的黨派鬥爭，是對僑胞本身不利的，是不是黨派鬥爭應該退出僑團？陳嘉庚認爲僑胞不團結的原因，主要由於國共在國內的爭執關係，如果國內政治鬥爭一旦不消滅，則僑胞一日不能走上團結之途。</p>
<p>論到陳嘉庚本人，雖然仍擁有福建帮的勢力，但是較之戰前，已是遜色多多。有人對他的做法，雖然明明知道不對，因爲鑒於過去的人事關係，或者一部份是他下屬的關係，多不便來對他作公開的反對。在抗戰期間，陳嘉庚用了南洋籌賑總會的相織，作、爲他在政治上活動的工具，就是最近他打給杜魯門總統的電報要求撤退駐華美軍。亦還是用着南洋籌賬總會的名義。現在已經有人提出籌賑總會在戰後已是一個可以結束的機關，若再利用這個名義來活動，未免越出了範圍，甚至有人要求他老人家將過去的賬目公開。這件事在新加坡當地會經閙得很兇，但是陳嘉庚始終沒有加以明確的表示。雖然有人還公開的說過；壽賑總會的款項，多被移作辦報的資金和宣傳的經費了。</p>
<p>此外，我們再來看看華僑社會中的商業情形，竟是一片蕭條景象，與戰前相較，不可同日而語，究其原因，主要的是橡膠的跌價，和荷印的戰事，成了致命傷。同時在此不景氣的景象下，生活程度又比較戰前高上了五倍之多，因此僑胞迫於生計，對政治已漸漸失去了興趣，雖然有些人對左派方面還不免有　聲附和的，但是實際上這不過成了是一件「時髦的玩意兒」。所以結論可以說：目前僑胞眞正的興趣，全部寄託於如何謀得生活上的安定，以及如何可以復興固有的經濟地位兩點上。</p>

<h3>亞東協會發表　對日和約意見　主先開四強外長會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕研究日本問題之亞東協會，於昨日下午三時在溧陽路會址招待記者，發表該會對日和約之意見。招待會由該會理事長賀耀組，暨宣傳委員會主委邵毓麟主持。首由賀氏致詞，闡述該會對日和約之意見，其要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於對日和約之程序，主張先開中美英蘇四强外長會譏，然後根據四外長議決召開遠東十一國外長會議，如蘇聯不參加，吾國應車新考慮態度，以不失獨立自主之精神爲依歸。</p>
<p>（二）關於日本領土問題，擁護開羅宣言，波茨坦宣言之規定，惟吾人站在中國立塲，理論上應主張琉球返還中國所屬。</p>
<p>（二）關於日本生活水准問題，不同意今後日本工業水凖，規定在一九三〇—三四年，因此無異承認日本軍國主義之經濟體制，吾人根據民間及專家意見，主張工業水凖應依生活水凖作決定，日本今後生活水凖，應以日本發動皇姑屯之一九二八年爲基凖，而予以適當之折合，使之不超過，不威脅任何亞東一國人民之生存。日本人民在此規定下，旣能生存繁榮，而亞東各國人民之生存，亦鮮少感受威脅，此自有經濟政治上之理由，及亞東集體安全之理由。</p>
<p>（四）關於日本天皇問題，確認「天皇」乃神權政治之護符，而神權政治乃軍國主義之寄託，吾人主張天皇制度應改變，縱日本人民意志願保留其存在，亦應改稱國王，以免日本民主制度前途發生障碍。</p>
<p>（五）關於賠償問題，認一切合約條款之重心在賠償故本意見對賠償條款所提原則及我國應得賠償比例，自覺公平而合理。</p>
<p>賀氏繼對該會組織及今後工作有所報吿，及畢，由邵毓麟氏提出若平補充意見，至六時散會。</p>

<h3>領導國人自力更生</h3>
<p>中國國民黨第六屆四中全會，今天在首都隆重開幕。蔣主席特自牯嶺返京，親自主持，足見此次會議之重要。這一次全會，殆爲國民黨最高執行機關在還政於民實施憲政之前的最後一次會議；國民黨本身的革新及今後政治的動向，均將視這次全會的結果如何而定。所以四中全會的意義，原已異乎尋常，何况適在政治經濟改革的呼聲響澈雲霄的今日舉行，其意義的重大，更値得全國人民的重視。</p>
<p>國民黨之在中國，不僅有悠久和光榮的歷史；而且在改造中國的過程中，有其不可　滅的功績；自興中會同盟會而還，國民黨在國父的領導之下，推翻滿淸，締造民國，打倒袁世凱，再造共和；其後又在蔣主席的領導之下，掃除軍閥，完成統一；　　日　，將百年來恥辱所積成的不平等條約。一筆勾銷。這些國民黨的豐功偉業，永垂不朽，是誰也不能否認的。　　抗戰勝利之後，因爲共匪的禍國殃民，致使勝利之果，寫　　　、不論在政治上經濟上社會上，均淸代着各種可怕的　機，知不能再來一次大刀闊斧的改革，則國家民族的前途，　　不　設想的遭遇，不待杜魯門總統特使魏德邁將軍發表離華聲明，我國朝野早就感　有「自力更生」的必要。戰後中國　　　　　　地步，眞是改造　中國歷史上的一大悲劇。但是中國將來的命運如何？仍將　中國國民黨能否領導全國人民走上「自力更生」的坦途而定。所以這次全會的召開，關係黨國的前途，實在太大了；我們除了祝望其成功而外，並願乘此機會，向國民黨說幾句話。</p>
<p>第一，國民黨對於國家民族，雖已有永垂不朽的功勞；但其所領導的國民革命，僅完成了三分之二。尙有三分之一，需要國民黨的繼續努力。雖然滿淸推翻了，軍閥掃除了，日本打倒了，不平等條約一律取消了；但是無惡不作的共匪問題，匪特迄未解決，而且正在擴大蔓延之中，中外局勢造成中國，非再走「自力更生」之路不可。國民黨若不能以其過去的革命精神與抗戰精神，領導全國人民，向着「自力更生」的大道邁進，則將有功虧一簣之虞。所以凡是國民黨的黨員，均應振奮革命精神，領導人民，完成「自力更生」的任務。我們相信唯有革命精神振奮飽滿的人，才有大無畏的氣魄，才能樂觀前進，才能克服當前的任何困難。所以我們希望出席四中全會的諸公，在討論黨務改革方案時，均須深切反省。問問國民黨的朗氣是否依然存在？想想那些對黨無堅強信仰的分子應否別除？國民黨黛員號稱四百萬名，重量不重質，徒　名與事何益，今日發動大規模的清黨運動，不論從那一個角度去觀察，實在是刻不容　的了。</p>
<p>第二，今後國民黨的任務，除了領導國人走上「自力更生」之路而外，還得要領導人民，學習民主政治的習慣使中國政治眞能走上「民主化」的正軌。一般人評論中國政治，向以「貪汚無能」稱之，就是吳秘書長鐵城前天也說：四中全會的重要課題，乃在肅淸貪汚剔除無能，革新政治。但是怎樣能達到這個目的，我們認爲很節單，一言以蔽之，只要政治能够民主化，貪汚與無能，就不會再存在。但是看看國民黨的內部組織，毋庸諱言尙未能做到「由下而上」，至今還是保持由上而下的作風，因此不僅黨與政脫節，而且黨部與黨員也脫節；不僅國內人才埋沒，就是黨內有爲者，也無脫穎而出的機會。近來「黨內民主化」的呼聲，日見高漲，四中全會討論黨務改革時，對於下級黨部的組織，自應特別加以重視。對於這次立委與國大代表的競選，尤應參照各民主國家，政黨競選的辦法，切實阻制國民黨黨員互相競爭，以樹立一個民主的新風尙。</p>
<p>第三，國民黨要求政府肅淸會汚，剔除無能，提高行政效率，由來已久；記得國民黨於本年三月間舉行三中全會時，也曾討論及置個問題；當時國民黨果能痛下決心，澈底改革政治，即不致招致魏德邁將軍的指摘，使每一個有自尊心的人民都到慚愧，經過這次可陽的教訓之後，這次全會終應該痛下決心，切實改新與民更始了。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要指出，否則一切都無從談起。目下民生痛苦，不堪言狀，國民黨對於實行民生主義，應該快些拿出具體辦法來；使人人均能安居樂業；切不可因循放任，坐視物價　漲，以致民不聊生，國民黨欲保持人民的信任，就應該從安定民生入手。</p>

<h3>蘆田均態度突變　日內閣地位動搖　保守派籌組強大新政黨</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京八日電〕蘆田外相六日在京都接見新聞記者，發表重要談話稱：「日本政局已在暗中動搖，傳吉田自由黨總裁組織之新黨，若能成功，則民主黨內之脫黨者，將有四五十名，而余希望只有十五六名。若有十五六名以上參加，則在黨方面，亦必加以考慮。蓋現片山內閣之政策業已碰壁，現內閣已失去國民之信仰，處于不得不讓出政權之時故也。惟新政黨必須有新政策及人物，而片山內閣之運命何時告終，係決定於新政黨與新政策何時出現。」又蘆田關於吉田等籌組之新黨，對於迫在眉睫之對日和會之態度，亦稱「余亦深有興趣」，並謂初步對日和會，當馬歇爾國務卿自南美歸國後，預科即將召開，而對日正式和會，至遲明春恐亦將舉行，故日本在開會前，必須積極準備，且不僅限於政界，抑且包括經濟社會各界之問題也。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京八日電〕視察東北地方農業狀况之平野農相，七日談稱：片山內閣正在動搖之說，並無其事。所傳本人脫離社會黨而開始以農民組合爲中心之新黨運動，亦非事實。此係根據憂慮本人今後須完全以全國農民組合從事活動及其他農民組合將繼續出現之人士，以爲未始不可在於社會黨之外另組農民黨之觀念而誤傳者。現在政界情形殊爲微妙，如社會黨分裂，則內閣決不能繼續維持，社會黨之政治影響，亦將大受打擊，目前實係社會黨最應自重之時也。</p>
<h3>建立韓臨時政府問題　美將交聯大討論　美蘇委員會放棄提供聯合報告</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓州雷克强內八日電〕據八日報稱：美國官員被蘇聯對建立韓國臨時政府之態度困煩已久，現正計劃將此問題提交月內啓幕之聯合國全體大會。據悉，自蘇聯正式拒絕美國主張於八日在此間舉行四强對韓會議後，美方已決定將問題擲與大會。蘇方之覆文聲稱：約經兩年研究之韓國臨時政府問題「並未使取得一致建議之可能性全部消失」，美官員則相信美蘇混合委員會既不能對任何基本問題有所協議，事實上已成無望之僵局。故美國主張回復至出發點，重行舉行大平洋四强會議。美國要求蘇聯在極短期內答覆四强會議之建議，頗堪重視，美方顯然希望在大會召開前獲得蘇聯之答覆。蘇聯之覆文既至，美國當可要求聯合國大會採取行動矣。</p>
<p>〔合眾社漢城八日電〕勃朗少將稱：蘇聯代表團顯然不欲在聯合報告中透露關於組織朝鮮臨時政府之基本不協調之點。混合委員會已放棄發表是項文件之企圖，蓋雙方均有許多反對與保留也。勃朗稱：聯代表團又企圖撤消「所有一切能描述美國之地位並解釋主要歧異點之事實聲明」。蘇聯特別企圖抹殺報告中關於蘇聯認爲因其爲反託管委員會會員，而無資格受諮詢之二十四個南韓政黨之參考材料。美方建議美蘇代表團各自提出其完全之報告，附函聲明雙方均未完全同意對方之報告，由雙方簽字後交於美蘇兩國政府，然蘇方亦未同意。</p>
<h3>日工會獨裁作風　盟軍總部表不滿</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京八日電〕盟總經濟與科學組勞工關係支部代理主席哈洛德稱，日本若干勞工領袖，抱有「錯誤之觀念」，認爲工人之智識不足爲其自身策劃，且不能使之直接選擇其當地或全國性之工會負責人。目前日本工會均由會員選出委員會而再由後者推舉負責人。渠文稱，日本有許多全國性之工會，目前仍多不與各地方支會討論，而單獨發號施令者，哈洛德强調，此種錯誤應予糾正，全國性工會之行動，應受各地方支會之指導。</p>

<h3>印度各地動亂　警吏奉命格殺勿論</h3>

<h3>美擬利用聯大會機會　對蘇展開外交戰　澳外長主張廢棄否決權</h3>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖七日電〕美國某權威人士聲稱，在即將舉行之聯合國大會中，美國將展開對蘇外交戰之最重要階段。美國之戰略係設法將聯合國之權力，自安理會移至五十五國全體大會。蓋在安理會中，蘇聯握有否決權，可以有恃無恐，大會中西方集團對三分之二多數，則左券穩操。美外交人員將相持不決之各問題，逐一從安理會移至大會議程上，故此次大會將成爲聯合國之轉捩點。</p>
<p>〔合眾社舊金山八日電〕澳外長伊伐特出席聯合國大會，途經此間發表談話，號召「聯合國各份子不應使用否決權，應恢復樂予接受之眞誠協調。不幸創建聯合國諸人之希望常遭違悖，尤其以安理會因否決權之使用而不能有所決定一事，違悖更多」。伊氏回憶舊金山會議中，空氣十分和諧，「即將召開之大會應恢復此和諧精神」。</p>
<h3>教宗敦促信徒　改進宗教文化</h3>
<p>〔合眾社羅馬八日電〕羅馬教皇庇護十二世今夜在聖彼得教堂向十萬餘聽眾發表演說稱：時至此際，宗教之反對陣綫已益趨明顯，天主教宜即有所行動。教皇前對杜魯門主張根據基督教義，以建立和平新世界之演說表示擁護後，茲復譴責壓迫及迫害宗教之行動，眾信此言當係指上月南斯拉夫控制之伊斯特里亞內，天主教牧師被人鞭打一事而言。最後教皇亦敦促天主教人士應致力於改進宗教文化云。</p>
<h3>希新閣宣誓就職　對游擊隊將頒佈大赦令</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典七日電〕自由黨領袖髙齡八十七歲之蘇福里斯所領導之兩黨聯合政府，業於七日宣誓就職。內閣計部長廿四人及副國務卿一人。自由黨在新閣中，除取得總理及副國務卿外，並取得其他九部。兩黨聯合政府之組成，已使希臘戰後最嚴重之政治危機爲之結束。</p>
<p>在美總統特使韓特森之協助下，自由，人民兩主要政黨，經一星期之耐心討論，業已成立歷史性的諒解。兩政府黨雙方之讓步，已得就溫和政策成立協議。希臘與論除共黨外，均歡迎此一政策，共黨則稱，希臘之新內閣爲「美帝國主義之民主櫥窗」。人民黨所允之讓步，爲同意對放下武器之遊擊隊頒佈赦令，並允諾解除右翼武裝團體之武裝。自由黨則同意於前項寬恕政策失敗時，可對共黨採取戡亂之嚴峻措施。新政府之建設計劃，包括發動大規模之公共工程，以吸收失業人民，並給予獲赦之遊擊隊以安定之生活。此一政策之目的，在削弱共黨對於勞工勞農之勢力。</p>
<h3>美國務院報告指出　英不復爲三强之一　共產勢力威脅西歐諸國</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕七日「華盛頓郵報」謂：國務院之極度機密報告曾指英國已不復爲三强之一。國務院對於此一報告，拒絕發表評論。據該「華盛頓郵報」稱，國務院之此一報告，係向調查參對外援助計劃之美國議員提出，該報暗示此一報告或係國務院決策委員會主委季南所擬。委氏甫自歐洲調查歸來。</p>
<p>其報告並曰，十四歐洲國家，即英，法，荷，葡，德，奧，義，希，土，丹，芬，捷，瑞典及波蘭等國爲求復興以反抗共產統治勢力之威脅起見，必須獲得外界之經濟援助。「華盛頓郵報」於評述英國之危機時，認爲英國减少在國外所負責任時，必須有系統地减少軍隊，俾便蘇聯之勢力不致驟然增長。以言法國，其親蘇之共產黨正在靜待機會，以奪取政權。法共認爲於歐洲復興計劃失敗，美國在法之聲譽喪失後，彼等之機會即已到來，故西歐及法國今正處于十字路口云。</p>

<h3>十年前命案未結　高院傳訊顧竹軒　否認教唆暗殺唐嘉鵬　索詐信筆跡已難對證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕十年前轟動滬上之天蟾舞台老闆顧竹軒被控敎唆殺人案，茲舊事重提，高院刑庭昨日下午二時傳顧訊問。緣民國二十二年六月十八日晨一時零五分，大世界經理唐嘉鵬，被人在大世界門口開槍暗殺身死。唐係黃金榮之得意門人，嗣經法捕房捕獲兇犯趙廣福，張廷桂。經第二特區法院判處趙無期徒刑，張徒刑二十年。於執行後，趙忽供出係受顧竹軒教唆，於廿四年十月廿七日經第二特院判處顧有期徒刑十五年。顧向高等法院第三分院上訴，於廿五年六月廿六日經高三分院審理結果，以趙有向顧敲詐嫌疑，其供詞不足憑信，宣判無罪。旋經法租界捕房律師向最高法院提起上訴，最高法院以高三分院判顧無罪未盡調査之能事，發回更審。惟適值廿六年抗戰軍興，政府西遷，此案遂亦擱置。勝利以後，高院接收偽法院，整理舊卷，對該案頗予重視。昨日高院開庭調查，王可權推事升座後，傳顧訊問。顧現任市參議員，鹽人，六十二歲。昨日到庭時，着灰色綢灰長衫，黃皮鞋，對庭上訊問有無教唆情形，供稱因事隔十餘年，已記不淸楚，對於趙廣視供受渠教唆，則稱係趙敲詐不遂，挾嫌誣告，有趙致渠索款函件爲證。庭上昨日調查重點，爲該項索款函件是否出於趙手，惟趙於淪陷期間，自北新涇監獄中釋出，嗣又因盜匪案入獄，連斃獄中。張廷桂於釋出後，即離開上海，不知去向，經此十餘年之變亂，重要證人有死亡者，有離滬者，調査頗爲困難。略訊一過，庭諭飭回，改期再審。</p>

<h3>特種營業稅　不能緩徵　發補市庫亦難照辦</h3>

<p>又辦：本市特種營業稅申報工作，上海直接稅局方面現正積極展開，聞該局所轄應納各單位現已紛紛開始申報。</p>

<h3>一紙護書　指卻利殺人　辯護人請判馬萊無罪　法官當庭宣佈不接受</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍事法庭昨晨九時開庭，續審余盛孝案。首由檢察官朗誦馬萊於上月十一日所寫就之辯護書，略謂渠於八月一日晨由京抵滬，中午於新麗珠酒吧晤却利，却利請其協助一項買賣，據謂，虹橋路五七一號之房子爲渠與美國某少校所合有，今擬請馬萊冒充少校，將此屋出售。渠當時同童，遂由却利僱車，馬萊穿便服戴呢帽，上車與却利同行。至午後五時許在外灘接一華人上車，後知即爲余盛孝。當時在車上並未交談，及汽車駛至虹橋路，却利先向余盛孝索得金條，旋即將其槍殺。余盛孝與本人同坐後座，致褲上染有鮮血。却利於殺人後即停車，將余盛孝踢至公路傍，並將本人載至其家，洗去血跡，將行凶之手槍交本人保管，並囑嚴守秘密，謂當有報酬。次日見却利時，據云，金條一時未能脫手，先交渠一百五十美元，以後直至被捕時爲止，並未與其見面。法庭隨即續審證人，先傳美軍偵緝課之兩班長，證實馬萊在偵緝課受審及將其中供移交軍事顧問團之事。</p>
<p>却利之妻　退庭昏絕</p>
<p>法庭繼即詳詢却利之妻，盤問達一小時以上。渠供稱：八月一日却利偕馬萊返家，已逾七時，因天時已晚，兩人之衣着均未看淸。兩人返家後，馬萊即入浴室洗澡，却利隨入，歷時約五十分鐘。口供至此，法官即詢以兩人在浴室之情形，却利之妻大怒，謂「此乃一愚蠢之問題」，隨復繼續供稱：浴室內並無異狀。是夕九時與却利同出觀劇，十一時返家。次日馬萊來訪，其夫與馬萊之談話，因不在塲，一無所知。至是辯護人詢其口供是否誠實，却利之　失聲痛哭，出庭之時，竟吿昏絕，法庭爲之發生騷動。</p>
<p>同室軍曹　證明有槍</p>
<p>却利之妻出庭後，隨即傳審與馬萊同室之軍曹兩人，均證明馬萊平日確有手槍。至是再詢却利開渠堅稱：馬萊所謂來滬一切費用由其負責一節，完全不確。同時，八月一日赴虹橋路時，渠之担任司機、乃完全馬萊之意。審問至此，已逾正午，乃宣布退庭。午後一時半繼續開庭，被吿辯護人波勒金依英美法律程序，提出動議、請法庭宣判馬萊無罪。波氏辯才無礙，技術熟練，謂渠有二十點以上之理由，可證明馬萊並非殺人凶手，隨即列舉要點，加以說明，並謂依馬萊之情形，軍事法庭逕稱之爲謀殺犯，責有不當，法官及檢察官，均不表示同意，後者並根據案例，列舉理由，表示不能接受被吿辯護人之動議。但波勒金仍覓出理由，支持本身之立塲，最後由主審法官帕爾謨上校宣佈：法庭不接受被吿辯護人之動議。</p>
<p>被告方面　提出反證</p>
<p>法庭休息五分鐘後，由馬萊之廦護人提化反證，第一個證人爲青浦自衛隊隊員何登魁，渠爲首批發現余盛孝中之一人，渠謂余盛孝當時僅稱爲外國人槍擊，詢以何人，則稱却利，未提及美國人。第二證人爲美軍僱員猶太人洛契，過去曾領敎過却利之空頭支票，謂却利爲人，名譽不佳。第三證人爲警局外事股長陶根榮，略陳以往偵査經過。第四證人爲百老匯大廈美軍招待所主任軍醫麥克蘭恩少校，渠稱：馬萊平日之工作尙可滿意，在工作時之行爲亦尙好。並謂馬萊於八月一日午後三時半左右向渠處報告，是否確於是日抵滬，則難於證明。至此主審官命退庭，改今晨九時起再審。</p>

<h3>希望上海交通　做到路不肇禍　交通安全宣傳週今日開始</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日爲本市本年度交通安全宣傳週第一日，市府爲喚起民衆注意，除由警局加派騎巡隊，分赴各要道口切實巡視指揮外，公用局並製就顯明標語十五種，分別在各衝要地點及車輛上張貼，同時吳市長，宣司令，潘議長，俞局長，趙局長等均將舉行特別廣播。今日起所有六輪卡車（公共汽車除外）禁止在南京東路行駛，公用局巳於南京路外灘及新世界兩處裝置「卡車及六輪以上車輛禁止通行」字樣木牌，以促駕駛人遵守。市府有關各局昨午召開會議，對本週內宣傳事宜曾作詳盡之商討，俾使順利進行。</p>
<p>車輛總數廿六萬部</p>
<p>據公用局最近調査報吿，本市所有車輛，截至本年七月上旬止，關於機動車輛部份，計自用汽車八，八七六輛，營業汽車一，○〇五輛，自用卡車三」四六四輛，營業卡車二·八八九輛，機器脚踏車二·八四一輛，試車汽車二〇八輛，試車機器脚踏車二〇輛，吉普汽車一三二八輛，軍用汽車二·〇七三，輛，軍用卡車一九四八輛，軍用機器脚踏車一〇五輛。共計二四。七五七輛。關於非機動車部份，計脚踏車一六三·五〇七輛，小車七二〇輛，二輪脚踏車七·九三〇國輛，自用馬車一七輛，營業馬車六三輛，馬拖運貨車一五輛，汽胎車貨一〇國，九八五輛，鐵輪貨車一四·六九七輛，自用人力車六·二二二輛，三輪自用人力車五·二五〇國輛，營業人力車一四·三七二輛，營業三輪車九·七一五輛，糞車二·一九一輛。單座三輪車六·一七一輛，共計二四一·八五五輛，總合共計二六六。六一二輛。</p>
<p>廣　作宣傳减少肇禍</p>
<p>本市車輛如此之多，人口增加已近五百萬，而道路建築並無進步，而積又寬狹不等，致車輛肇禍事件日有發生。去年九月九日起，市府曾劃定蘇州路以南，中正東路以北，西藏路以東，中山東路以西區域爲中區，頒定「改善中區交通辦法」，對行車，停車，及橋樑交通，依照辦法嚴格管理，一年來成績頗佳。惟因此種管理制度尙未能普及全市，故本市交通肇禍事件仍未逐漸减少。據警局統計：本年一月份共一八三件，一一月份、共二〇九件，三月份共一九七件，四月份共二〇九件，五月份共二二四件，六月份共二〇七　，至七月份止共一八三。件。</p>
<p>改善中區交通辦法實行已屆一年，車輛駕駛人及行人仍多忽視交通管理規則，或穿越紅燈，或不聽指揮，小則影響個人安全，大則使整個交通情形發生沘亂，市府對此極表遺憾。故本週內將針對此種情形廣作宣傳，俾謀澈底改善。吳市長昨曾表示：本市治安希望能做到「夜不閉戶」，交通方面則希望做到「路不肇禍」。</p>

<h3>全魯工礦中心　博淄礦區踏勘　確保各礦井安全　協助民營廠復工</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南四日航訊〕淄博爲全魯工礦中心，舉凡煤，玻璃，瓷器，鋁，鐵，鉛，銀，金等莫不具飾。其中前三者開採已著成效，鋁於抗戰末期，在日寇經營下亦巳開始出品，且被譽爲東亞第一輕金屬工廠，其蘊藏之會可知。自抗戰勝利後，該地嘗三陷匪手，八月十七日國軍三度光復，記者爲了解該區實况，於上月廿八日偕綏區新聞處范處長奇浚親往視察，經歷城，龍山，明水，王村，於廿九日晚到達博山，卅，卅一兩日在博參觀刧後各工礦，一日離博赴西河參觀悅昇煤礦，午後到溝川參觀魯大煤礦，二日離淄赴南定參觀輕金屬工廠，當晚經張店至周村，三日晚返抵濟。途間嘗一度翻車，兩遭土八路攔襲，艱險備嘗，幸免於難。爰將各情分節爲本報讀者吿。</p>
<p>淄博區煤礦的總儲量，據專家佔計，在二十億噸以上，其中分爲（一）國營，（二）省營，（三）民營三種，而以國營的魯大悅昇二礦規模爲最大，據估計僅該二礦蘊藏量即達十三億噸，幾佔全區總儲量三分之二。</p>
<p>魯大礦塲在張搏支綫淄川站東南三公里的洪山，礦塲周圍達十五華里。光緒廿五年德人藉口曹州敎案於强佔膠州灣後開始修築膠濟鐵路及張博支綫，光緒廿七年復創辦淄川炭礦，直到民國三年第一次歐戰發生時始全被日人侵據。華府會議後形式上改由中日合辦，民國十二年正式成立魯大公司，實際上直到勝利到來前、，大權全在日人之手。悅昇煤礦原係商辦，有西河，桃花峪，大奎山等煤礦，民國卅二年日人强迫與之合作，日人投降後，該兩礦於卅四年八月廿三日即被共匪侵佔，後經政府向日提出交涉，於九月十四日又由日軍收回，由國軍受降，並接收，但至卅五年一月十三日又被共匪第二次侵佔，至同年七月十一日國軍收復後，山東綏靖區統一指揮部爲適應環境，組織工礦管理委員會，管理淄博區所有煤礦，該兩礦亦在其列，至同年十一月十一日始正式由資源委員會淄博煤礦管理處接收，其中關於悅昇礦塲，因原係民營，所有產權債務，均正由法院淸查中，在法院未正式裁定前，公司方而仍承認其產機。</p>
<p>淄博區在抗戰前，煤的總產量約爲每月廿萬噸，其中魯悅兩礦爲十萬噸强，佔全區產量之半。抗戰初期產量甚少，自廿九年起至卅四年，日寇銳意經營，平均月產達卅萬噸，其中魯悅兩礦達十八萬噸，約佔全區產量十分之六。去歲共匪佔據時，因煤對匪需要不大，原有存煤，足敷匪用，故產量甚微，自淄博煤礦公司接管後，積極整理，力謀增產，至本年二月廿三日國軍撤退前，兩礦產量，已月達四萬五千噸。八月十七日，淄博三度光復，至廿七日各接收人員相繼到達，經詳細檢查，悅昇無大損失，句內即可復工，魯大地面運輸設備，如電車綫路及高壓綫路雖被破壞，器材倉庫及木工廠雖被焚燬，各修理工廠母機零件雖多被卸去，差幸動力設備皆完好無恙，上月聯總煤業專家克里沙來濟視察，已允代爲保留必需之機器材料，現已遵資委會指示先接收整理保管，再擬復工計劃呈請政院撥款。省營博山一礦成立於民國卅五年，爲博大，福大，利大三礦合組而成，其中除利大遭匪破壞不能採掘外，在本年二月廿三日撤離前，月產達八千噸。此次共匪於撤退時除器材零件刧掠一空外，礦坑機械，大致完整，經整修並將坑內積水　乾後，九月一日已正式開始復工，日產原煤二百噸。</p>
<p>至淄博區民營廠礦共廿三家，其中除華東等二礦於共匪佔領期間爲維持工人生計，由工人出面維持照常出煤現仍繼續開採外，餘多因礦井積水過多，正準備復工中。</p>
<p>按淄博區煤的總儲量旣如此深厚，出產量如軍事上無特殊變化，當不難逐漸提高至月產卅萬噸，（日寇原計劃於卅六年度增產至八百萬噸。）而質的方面，含灰量僅百分之十二，除稍遜於棗莊煤礦外，遠較開　北票話煤礦爲優。抗戰期間，日寇冬將此煤專供九州鍊鋼廠等鍊鋼之用。如津浦膠濟二路恢復則除濟靑兩地外，兼可解決京滬平津的煤荒。目前的困難，據有關各方提供的意見是；</p>
<p>（一）交通；膠濟西段現只濟南郭店間四十五華里可以通車，　店張店間鐵路皆被破壞，至張店博山支綫原有路軌，亦被共匪改築成一公尺寬之輕便鐵道，現該支綫鐵道雖完整，但在共匪時期賴以通車之四個車頭全被破壞，幾經搶修，只完成其一，車頭缺乏，行車組艱，至膠濟正綫的鐵路材料，爲了要儘先完成津浦路徐濟段，膠濟西段材料，截至目前，尙無着落，其間尤以枕木，特感缺乏，據估計，最多只能展築至明水，如僅仗公路運煤，運量旣小，遝費復昂，現淄博原煤，雖僅廿五萬元一噸（進淄博金區現有存煤共約六萬至八萬噸。）但如以汽車運至濟南，每噸計需一百二十萬，成本過鉅，依然無法解除濟市當前煤荒，故一般渴盼至少能延修至王村，僅王村淄川間廿五公里利用汽車，如此運輸計劃，方勉可與生產計劃配合。</p>
<p>（二）從速舉辦工礦貸款，俾各民營廠礦，早日開採，國營之魯大亦應以突擊精神，速謀正式復工，使最初原有之三萬五千工人人及博山之四萬八千工人（全博山煤工總數）皆得早日各安生業。</p>
<p>（三）共匪於撤退前，到處揚言此次對工碼設備所以未加破壞，乃在準備於兩月以內再行歸來作「第四次解放」。爲避免生靈塗炭，地方再受糜爛，在各縣地方武力未獲充分重建及加强前，政府應加派正規部隊，確保各礦井安全，並擴大收復區，務由點綫佔領擴展至面的控制。（特派員麗天）</p>

<p>若干房東爲避兌受罰起見，不用外幣計算租金，而按照麵粉市價，如每月租費爲麵粉十二包等。此間有一好處，租金不索小費，但亦有一部份房東學上海人樣，須預付房租五六個力。娛樂塲所均於午夜閉門，青禁從一時開始，須有特別派司方可通行，惟多數人皆在一時前就寢，故亦無甚不便。外交界及軍界中人，皆喜居北平，以調往他處爲不幸。</p>
<p>糧食豐裕　酒類廉美</p>
<p>此間糧食匯富，種類頗繁，並不實施配給，酒類尤稱價廉物美。北平在未還都時，各國大使公使皆住居東交民巷，別有天地。今則列强中原有大使駐平各國，或竟未設一領事。東交民巷已歸中國管理，昔日大使館或任其空關，或祗一部份有人居住，日德兩國使館則已由中國接收。</p>
<p>外僑不多　蘇僑撤退</p>
<p>北平外僑原本不多，自蘇聯撤退僑民，人數因之益减。北平商業雖奄奄無生氣，物價或將繼續趨漲，但即不甚寬裕之人，生活亦尙舒適，一班自糧食不足，房屋缺乏，且無僕役可供使喚之國家旅行至此者，尤將視爲樂土。</p>

<h3>體育節的回憶</h3>
<p>— 吳邦偉</p>
<p>當抗戰的中途，各方面感覺到人民體能的低弱，影響軍事和生產，而發出了提倡體育，增進國民健康的呼聲。敎育部爲討論如何實現這一個要求，乃呈准於廿九年十月十日，召開國民體育會議，通過了許多辦法，尤其感覺到需要一個完美的法律，明定責任，指示方針，以為實施的準　，於是提出並通過了修正國民體育法議案。敎育部再根據這一個決議，邀集有關機關及專家，在文字上作一度修正，呈經行政院修正通過，轉送立法院審議，經過三讀通過，呈請國民政府核定，此修正後的國民體育法，遂於中華民國三十年九月公布。</p>
<p>在國民體育法修正公布以後，敎育部負有全國體育行政責任，除照國民體育會議的各種決議，在可能範圍內付之實施外，認爲國民體育是整個的社會活動，需要有一個固定的節目，來促起國民的普　注意。於是又根據；（一）國民體育法是九月九“公布的；（二）九月九日在廢是重九登高節，正符合體育的意義；這兩點意思，呈請行政院明定九月九日爲體育節，旋奉院令核准，第一次體育節遂於中華民國三十一年九月九日誕生，並由敎育部規定舉行辦法，與社會部會令各地方遵照施行。以後每年統由兩部會銜，於期前通令過知，以提醒各地方，使體育節能逐漸成爲一個有意義的節日，從而影響到到國民體育的推行與發展。如此算來，本年的體育節該是第六次了。</p>
<p>在第六次體育節的今日，我不禁有感。第一，國民體育法公布七年，似乎未被遵重，未被注意，因此一切體育事業，顯着毫無進步，毫無出路。第二，想到徒法不能行的故語，凡是體育界的人士，應該加倍努力，忠於所事，更進一步以團結的力量，來促成國民體育法的有效實施。國際風雲，變幻莫測，千萬不能到下次被侵略的時候，再感到國民體格的不良，而復演過去的歷史，</p>

<h3>外匯平衡基金會主委　陳光甫正式視事　以消滅外滙黑市爲主要目標</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯平衡基金委員會主任委員陳光甫氏，於昨日上午十時許，正式到會就職視事。陳氏並於十一時許，會同該會委員徐柏閱，沈熙瑞在中央銀行會議室，接見本市新聞界，即席發表渠就職時職時面談話如次：</p>
<p>中國現値極艱苦之時期，政府爲求自力更生，保存國家資源，勢不能不對外匯加以以嚴格管制。蓋中國缺乏外匯資金，正與其他國家情形相似，故對於輸入及其他方面之外匯支出，不得不採取節約政策。當知處今日情况下，吾人經濟生活欲圖一切仍循舊慣，固爲事實所不許。此不僅中國爲然，最近英國頒佈各種自力更生之措施，亦莫不如是；而英國人民應應付經濟困難之精神，至足供吾人之取法與借鏡，</p>
<p>近來中國國際收支差額，已逐漸减少。但欲繼續改善，尙特吾人之多方努力。政府正計劃設法推廣出口，以期增益外匯收入，深盼可收良好之效果。</p>
<p>關於平衡基金委員會之工作，與以前鄙人所擔任之中美中英三國平準基金委員會工作性質不同，（自一九四一年起陳氏即任該平準基金委員會主席（蓋彼時以戰事關係，國際貿易幾已完全停頓，而現在之工作則在如何渡過艱難之復員時期，是以處理之方亦隨之而異。</p>
<p>最後應特別提出者，外匯問題不過爲整個經濟問題之一部分，欲求一般經濟之穩定，不能僅靠外匯政策，尙有賴於其他政府機關之經濟措施能互相配合。如日用必需品之供應適當，物價之穩定以及黑市交易之逐漸消滅等等，皆爲最切要而不可少之措施，至外匯黑市交易深盼正當用途得有外匯供給之後，黑市可以逐步减少。</p>
<p>然而今後本會一切工作之推行，實大有賴於金融界及公衆之合作與維護，此則不勝盼禱者也。</p>
<p>陳氏旋就各報社記者所提問題，分別解答，並由徐沈兩委員，補充說明。茲探誌犬要如次次：（一）外匯黑市之存在，不獨我國爲然，即如英，美，墨西哥，香港等地，亦均有此現效。消滅黑市，爲本會之主要工作，惟許多技術問題，正待研究設法解決。同時深望各界推誠合作，以底於成。（二）平衡委會將根據自力更生，與量入爲出之兩大原則，力求基金收支平衡。（三）外匯平衡基金之來源，以推廣輸出爲主要收入。故政府決鼓勵輸出，俾轍入亦得之比例增加，而使物價趨於平穩。輸出數量之增加，不致使民生艱苦，且外匯合理調整後，國外市價亦不致遭受業響。（四）中國法幣價値，自有其本位及立塲。與美金或英鎊有深切聯擊之說，並無根據。惟目前以美貨輸入較多，致對美匯之需要較多耳。</p>
<h3>市塲交易淸淡　華股升沉不一</h3>
<p>華股昨更形頹廢，交易淸淡，無人活動，各股升沉不一。新光景福得增資實行之助，游資漸漸轉向，與元老股商務，都吿求過於供，三者最爲堅穩，均站高檔。華豐所跌最多，火柴新股登塲，與增資前相較，不過爾爾，永紗曾於中途得一一六號陳某，一二五號楊某，及少壯派派五二號之吸納，會現小蘇，但以後勁不繼，臨收仍露衆叛親離之象，趨勢難於樂觀。</p>
<p>晨開時見穩，遞永紗開後，由二二二四號等賣到二三八元，一二九號等曾進至二四三元，九四號等俱售，後低至二三九元，十時後後，經一一六號首先來進，一六號亦買，三五號紛購現遞不少，乃見拉高至二四二元及二四五元高價。</p>
<p>十時半後，塲外息價開一角六分半及二角一，市勢漸盤，嗣由二三五號二三號賣出遞交，九七號賣出即交，而迫低至二四〇元左右，此時外股依然堅定，人心尙易振作，七六號等俱再吸納，而又漲到二四二元及二四五元。二八號等袂袂脫售，近午散買恐慌，復呈不支，永紗竟步降至二三三二元及二三七元低價結束。收後喊價平疲，新光景福商務反以高價收市。</p>
<p>結果較上週六即交股計新光景福微升，信和新華勤興平平，華豐跌半成，永紗美亞永公微挫，大通內衣亦平，商務麗安小升，餘均小挫。遞交股計華鹽跌半成，景福漲半成，新光微升，永紗信和美亞勤興小挫，塲外各老股稍見降落。</p>
<h3>新光內衣又將增資</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新光內衣廠定於本月廿二日召開臨時股東會，重要議案，傳與討論資產升値問題有關。據王經理石聲方面消息，升三認三，或升四認二，目前尙未決定。據接近傳總經理良駿方面消息，該公司已擬就增建新廠計劃，將於唐山路總廠空地上，另建一「最新型織布工廠」，可以容納國外預定之最新式織布機三四百台，聞大批建築材料，現正積極搜購，最近即將開工云。</p>
<h3>統債平穩　外股轉挺</h3>
<p>公償昨形勢由疲回穩，各債榮辱不一，過程則仍平庸。統丙晨開一四〇〇〇元，低價一三六〇〇元，高價一四六〇〇元，而後稍平。六一四室等有賣，五〇三室等買進，成交約六百餘萬。結果較上週六計甲乙升二〇〇元，統丙升一〇〇元，統丁跌三〇〇元，統戊微挫一〇〇元。</p>
<p>外股昨形勢轉挺，買戶漸形活躍，怡紗晨開八七〇〇〇元，盤漲到九〇五〇〇元而後稍盤。證券帮銀行帮洋商有買，猶太商廣帮及金匯帮俱拋。結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐業廣怡啤航業毛絨微漲，紙業鋼業電話祥泰各升半成左右。</p>
<h3>食米市勢堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到七千四百餘石，天氣陰雨粳米消化尙可，形居堅挺之勢。早薄稻去化活潑，挺升三五千元。白元貨稀市堅，陰元物稀爲貴，再漲萬元。新粳定局，秈米去化仍呆，高定次疲</p>
<p>麵粉配價不動，惟多搭洋粉一成，無形暗緊。雜牌粉統粉均升一二千元，麩皮鄕銷活靈，供不應求，直綫上升，再加三四千元。</p>
<p>豆餅消化冷淡，急轉直下，狂挫三四千元。黃豆油廠均抱看望，客銷停頓，另化甚細，新豆步俏三五千元，陳豆旦亦然軟化。菉豆交淡少神，回低三五千元，菀豆到銷兩少，市形站立。蠶豆客帮不動，本街另化尙有，來貨不多，市面挺定，紅糧隨到隨銷，暫無呼吸。</p>
<p>苞米北洋仍然沉悶，南洋略有納胃，價無波動。芝蔴洋莊微有問津，疲中帶定，生仁華南進意甚懈，步跌萬元。新生仁江河日下，繼續慘跌六七萬元，小麥暗暗上升，存到兩少，午後廠方麩皮閒出大包八萬五千元。</p>
<p>食油價穩定</p>
<p>食沒供應，以上週中售局將在手存貨，託第三區植物油　煉業公會大量向市塲不斷拋售後，八日晨市價屹然不動，與上週杪無異。茲悉：昨蜄該公會再繼續向市塲以八二萬元拋售豆油九九〇担，以七四萬元拋售菜油一二〇〇担。又中植汕廠代中實公司　一〇六萬拋售生油六五桶（每桶三六〇斤）。</p>
<p>並悉：中植對經常配售仍繼續維持，昨日配出菜油三五〇担，予丙種五〇一號至六〇〇號之零售油店。</p>
<p>麵粉運靑島</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕海蘇輪昨日駛靑島，由滬運去麵粉二萬九千九百餘包，食糖四百餘包，肥皂一千箱，及雜貨二千餘件，共約三萬三千餘件。</p>
<h3>美金短期庫券　昨已恢復發售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年美金短期庫券，已自八日起，恢復發售。全國發售地區，有上海，南京，北平，天津，漢口，重慶，廣州，福州，厦門，汕頭，西安，靑島，杭州，桂林，梧州，昆明，海口，湛江，江門等十九處。售價係以當地中央銀行美匯牌價爲計算標準。外埠各地，俟奉中央銀行總行電令後發售。聞現除中交農三行，郵匯中信兩局外，其他商業行莊，已一律停止代售。九月份發售額二千萬元內，上海分配一千萬元，其餘一千萬元，由國行分配各地發售。</p>
<p>又關於過去銷售情形，昨據國行員責人談稱：美金短期庫券，係自本年四月七日起開始發售。至八月十七日，因修正外匯管理辦法公佈，暫行停止，總計售出二千七百五十二萬五千九百二十美元，內各地銷售數額，以上海爲最多，計一千三百五十八執八千九百七十美元。其次爲南京，計四百九十三萬一千五百九十美元。又天津，計二百四十七萬一千三百八十美元。重慶計一百二十二萬六千九百一十美元。漢口計一百零二萬四千零四十美元。又上海市每月售出數額，計四月份售出一百七十七萬四千六百六十美元，五月份售出三百六十萬三千六百九十美元，六月份售出二百八十七萬五千九百一十美元，七月份售出四百四十九萬八千六百二十美元，八月份截至十六日止，計售出八十三萬六千零九十美元。（八月份上海以外各埠，共售出一百〇七萬九百美元）。所有上海及其他各地售出數額，本行每日對財政部均有報告。又關於美金庫券，向國行抵押情事，據稱：除商業行莊依照規定，得以庫券抵繳半數存款準備金外，其餘並無以庫券向本行抵押云。</p>
<h3>棉紗議價提高　廿支紗掛一千一百廿萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡綢會棉紗議價，廿支紗昨日掛一千一百廿萬元，較前漲十萬元，其他各支紗依此比例推算。</p>
<p>昨日中國紡建公司仍分甲乙兩組售紗，甲組共售七八八件，申購單三三八張。乙組共售一一四五件，申購單八三一張。以上共售紗一九三三件，合廿支紗三一一三件，申購單共一一六九張。</p>
<p>紗價平定</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開以紡建公司代紡調會售紗牌價提高，市氣均趨堅俏，喊價各見微升。旋因獲利多頭了結甚多，且紡建公司大量配出，而實需依然滯，市面頓吿回軟。結果四二支藍鳳紗及廿支特雙馬軋平。</p>
<p>棉布趨堅</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因天氣轉凉，實銷略見起色，本街收吸不寂，客帮亦有零星添辦，惟染廠家則仍少活動。市上籌碼不充，行情趨堅，結果十二磅龍頭細布做高至四十九萬八千元，比週六續漲八千元。</p>

<p>昨日現棉平穩，紗廠不斷有吸，人心堅穩，交易較上週六稍旺，價格暗好二三萬。</p>
<h3>人造絲呆滯</h3>
<p>人造絲因實銷淸淡，且配貨貶價，以致欲漲無力。昨市一二〇號金三馬及天橋等開盤喊二千五百七十萬元，最小到過六十萬元。廠經昨喊價與上週末無變化，但買戶還價甚短，故高勻度五担頭毫無交易，另担有十餘担成交。綢貨大致堅穩，眞絲被面開市在一千二百廿三四萬元之間，最大做開二十六萬元。大誠與華强價同，華錦縐昨價二萬四千五百元。</p>

<h3>落霞三章</h3>
<p>— 曹國平</p>
<p>城河</p>
<p>傍晚，我總喜歡獨自到這條淸澈和寬闊的城河邊。</p>
<p>緋色的殘霞落在河面，反射出淡黃色的波光，鑲着蘋菓綠的　邊，多美麗啊！</p>
<p>這像平鏡樣的河面，沒有一絲漪漣，眞如加利利海的水面受了耶穌斥責後一般的寗靜。</p>
<p>載起了一天的重負的城河，如今可以安息了。不，它祗知是供給，不知得酬報；它祗是貢獻，不想享受。它增强了貨物運輸的便利，减輕了旅客艱辛的步履。它還保存着伊甸園中的溫馨，和平和博愛，也仍帶着蓬萊仙島的祥和。</p>
<p>驀驀然，一隻滿載稻草的大船駛過，這平靜的河波立刻濺起旬然的浪花，捲起了旋轉的水渦，兩岸的　葭激動得搖移不停…………。</p>
<p>河面重歸寗靜，這淡黃色連大的波光開始被罩着一層暗澹的深綠色……漸漸地深，深……。</p>
<p>我但願這城河靜恬地安息着，不再經受着任何的吵擾和激動</p>
<p>在歸家途上，我不禁自嘆着</p>
<p>——我也不是像這城河嗎？得不到片刻安息，每一件世事經過心靈時，便會激起內心的痛苦，刺激，煩惱……幾時才會得到安寗呢？</p>
<p>總是在彩霞褪色前，一顆晶亮發着淡光的黃昏星在西天鑽出頭向人間招呼。</p>
<p>我從小就有愛黃昏星的癖習，但不知所以然，祗因看到它最早出現而且在星中算是極大的。</p>
<p>現在我越發覺到它的可愛和美麗。它是黑夜的光聲，它是忠誠的先知，警吿我們黑暗的將臨報吿我們黑暗的權成。這黃昏星一到天黑便無形無踪地消逝，是它逃避夜神的咒詛和爪牙？是他被黑暗吞食了？</p>
<p>見到黃昏星又會想起一個已爲國犧牲的知友，在他末封信中他寫着：「我現在的處境正是像天上的黃昏星，雖然未來險　和黑暗的前途是我唯一的勁敵曾把我完全吞噬，但我乘現在盡我最大的努力……</p>
<p>薄暮，在園圃中納凉，總看到黃昏星。我感謝它，給了我不少記憶和默示。</p>
<p>號聲</p>
<p>殘　在藍天上褪了色，城南的軍營中傳出隨着習凉風送來在練習的號聲。</p>
<p>我懂得這是在練着的休戰號—是沉東，激越，嘹喨—當閃掠過我脆弱善變的心靈時，這音調是分外的凄切，嚴肅，悲壯。它使我產生了一種莫名的悲痛，鈎引了懺悔的淚珠，我覺得這已是蘊藏了好久，祗是一直給世俗的瘴氣抑退……。</p>
<p>這號聲使我開始感到我像是帶着顧頷的臉，淋血的身體，路躓的步履從人生的沙塲負傷關來的兵士。我感到肉體的喜樂褪了色，生命的掙扎失了味。我覺到貪食「名利勢慾」智慧菓的人總受到靈魂上永久劍痛的刑罰。</p>
<p>在五光十色的繁華城中，我像一隻瘋狂的野馬在廣漠的塲上永遠無目的地騁馳着，像燈蛾一樣永遠得不到慾望上滿足地追尋着，像駝鳥一樣永久露着身和足在以爲掩蔽了自己的罪惡，像……。</p>
<p>感謝這號聲，它又一次給了我靈眼睜開的機會，使我認淸人生的眞諦，使我保守自己心靈勝過保守一切。但我怕明天的黃昏號聲，又是潸潸淚水的催淚劑。</p>
<h3>沙爾德的新劇劇本</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>我國現在最被人注目的存在主義者沙爾德（Jean　Paul　Sartre，　1905－）新編了兩個劇本，已在巴黎上演，還不曾譯成英文，那就是「未葬的死屍」（Morts　Sans　Sepulture）和「可敬的妓女」（La　Putain　Respectueuse）。現在把這兩個劇本的情節介紹在下面：</p>
<p>「未葬的死屍」敍幾個叛逆者被軍政機關捉去，關在一個學校的高樓上，等待審問和下面課室的用刑。當局想盡方法，要加重刑罰，一面喝得醺醺大醉，一面聽着嘈雜的無綫電，說些無聊的空話。樓上囚犯們則商量一個方法，寗願受苦，不肯說出秘密，大家一致行動。</p>
<p>在繼續拷問時，一個囚犯跳窗自殺，還有一個囚犯年紀太小，他的姊姊怕他不懂得「勇敢」的意義，允許他被人紋死。這戲劇看起來高潮該是囚犯的勝利，他們說給審判者的話都是謊言。但是意想不到的，結果竟是最高當局葛羅契特（Clochet）不要他們的證據和招供，把他們全都槍斃了。也許沙爾德是想問我們：「在一個暴虐在（Sadism）的人面前，這些因犯的勇敢究竟有什麼用呢？」</p>
<p>「可敬的妓女」一開塲便是紐約一個妓女的平房，有人控吿某一黑人强奸白種婦女，這黑人請求妓女李熙（Lizzie）證明他不曾犯罪。她答應了這個請求，後來却毀了約；這時一個上議院議員欺騙她，與她談愛國，知道她渴慕尊貴的人，便藉此愚弄她。</p>
<p>後來那被追的黑人躱在她的平房裏，她把他藏了起來。但上議院議員的兒子胡里德正想請她帮忙，發現了那黑人，便用手槍打那然人，不曾打中。黑人逃掉了。李熙舉起槍來，對準胡里德。胡里德用話說服了她，結語是：「我的父親是上議院議員，不久我就要在他以後也做上議院議員了。我是有權利生存的。像你這樣的女人是不應該打我道樣的人的。」</p>
<p>後來胡里德又向李熙求婚，答應給她一座大厦住，藉以消磨時日。一個黑人被加私刑，（却不是要捉的那一個），羣衆便很滿意的回家了。這戲劇又說明鬥爭的無用。批評家稱此爲輕鬆的笑劇。</p>
<h3>聞對日行將召開和約初步　會議有感書此</h3>
<p>— 惺</p>
<p>處處猶存萬戶灰，是誰武斷倡和來？，由他譎許談民主，鷹眼常遺狡建　才。</p>
<p>珍珠港上血初乾，其奈揄揚意轉安，多少寃魂沈海底，又看握手話新　。</p>
<p>受　當時誰最深，可憐猿鶴百年心；屬齊屬楚情猶昔，贏得　縷憶歡音。</p>
<p>屬　千載不尋仇，聞道吳門尙有樓；倘使式繩人再至，吾頭願作伍員頭</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>剛一走到特別區與「法租界」分界的那座橋上，小老虎忽地對耀羣放出了警號。</p>
<p>「我想趕去瞧瞧熟鬧，紀姨！」小老虎警號之後，忽然向耀羣這麼要求着；完全是鄕下孩子的口氣。</p>
<p>「慢着！」耀羣止住了小老虎，一而繼續留意四下來往的行人，覺得並無岔眼的對象，便問小老虎：「怎麼一回事？」態度上十分平淡，就像姐弟二人在閒撩天似的。</p>
<p>「前面橫道上，我瞧見好像在「出會」，又像「趕集」，準定很熱鬧，他們朝北去了。」說着，又放低了聲音：「您先去找地方歇下，回頭我會找來的……」一面把兩隻小包袱都交了給耀羣。小老虎的行動，一直是這麼迅疾決絕。</p>
<p>「別放野，早些回來，…等你吃午飯！…」耀羣趕着叮囑了這句話，在小老虎肩上輕輕拍了一下，送走了這個小小的獵獸專家。</p>
<p>橋與前面的橫路，隔着不下三百碼以上的距離，雖說橋身高出平路，但普通人一眼望去，也不會看出遠遠橫路上詳明淸晰的動態；最多只能依約眺見一些些人影車馬的晃動。耀羣知道小老虎的視力比較常人强得多，也知道他必有所見，所以讓他去了。</p>
<p>「朝北？？…這北邊是什麼地方？……」耀羣一面走一面拿小老虎所語這兩個字，作一個關鍵，希望琢磨一條綫索出來。但因耀羣對天津地境不大熟悉，不知道「法租界」刺北就是「日租界」，所以一時推想不出一個道理來。</p>
<p>「媽的，又是誰家子孫走了霉運哪！」迎着耀羣走來的兩個商店夥計打扮的之一，這麼咕噥着；又像議諷，又像憤慨。</p>
<p>「咱們多吃飯，少說話！」另一個打着純粹天津衛的腔個：「他媽的，今日這個世界是嗎世界？大白天說不定會有鬼抹頭！反正咱們眼不亂霎，嘴不多話，沒有錯…。」</p>
<p>「…總共十幾人哪！」迎面又是一老兩少，三個人走了過來，一個十幾歲的孩子，穿着敞領襯衫，長腿褲；有些像小老虎的那一套，不過整齊得多；一壁走一壁對那老的說着：「七八個年靑的，像大學生，四五個年紀大些的有些像敎師……」</p>
<p>「我瞧見他們的手，兩人一連，都有鐵鎖拴着…」另一個較小的孩子發表了他的觀察所得。</p>
<p>一那是鐵鎖？哈，可別呌人笑掉下巴哪；連一個外國手銬都不認識…。」</p>
<p>「走道兒罷，別儘瞎撩，……咱們明日準定下鄉去，這兒不好待哪！…老年的走耀羣身旁擦過的時候，這麼悄聲低語地嘆息着。</p>
<p>以上五個人的閒談，把剛才橫路上的「事件」風景綫，給耀羣描畫出了一個粗技大葉輪廓。愈往前走，收集的參老資料愈多；她用這些資料拚凑成了一幕慘劇，大約正是小老虎去追紫的這回事。</p>
<h3>路旁</h3>
<p>— 李蔚初</p>
<p>我常常這樣想——那也許是種下意識，一什麽時候今天過去了，腦子裏能不再計算到明天的日子，或是這一月裏能不算着下一月的預計，我也就輕鬆了。」然而事實上，心裏總有一種憂慮深深的壓着，後面也總有一個陰影一緊緊的跟隨；說恐怖也不是，意識又明確的超然的站在物質的生活之外，呌把精神提高到實際的生活之上；但偶然一兩句的聽說到什物又漲了，——這對於一家四口的我底薪水的負担，實在是一個嚴重的威脅。——因之就形成了我的精神與物質對立的狀態。我無法超出這種實際生活給予精神上的影響和刺激！</p>
<p>照例，這是一個美好的黃昏，夕陽的淺光柔和的照着馬路，是下班的時候了，我挑選路旁的蔭凉處行走，一個斷腿殘肢的人在路旁以剌耳的哭聲乞討着，這是一個慘厲的景像。往常，當着這些人伸川乞討的手，我心裏就不忍使他們空着縮回，若是年老的乞丐，我心裏更會難過和不忍。雖然我也並不是什麼人道主義者，所謂「惻隱之心，人皆有之」。也許我只是能軟弱的給予這一點無用的同情。</p>
<p>但現在，不幸的事件太多了，人們的同情心也日漸稀薄而淡渺；這以後，我就漸漸的也學習着忍心，而臨着凄凉與不幸，我也學習着毫不動情；眼看着他們伸出了乞討的手，我快步的跑開，逃過了他們的乞討。在起初，有時候我還會難過和自覺羞愧，隱隱的受到良心的譴責，以爲我是墮落了，學壞了。但日子一久，我便習以爲常，這種情感也就漸漸消失了，心靈裏不會再有聲音來責備。若有，那時候，靈魂的光輝最明媚……</p>
<p>因著腦子裏有著這種種的思潮起落，脚步就遲慢了，離前面不遠的地方，那兒圍了一羣人，再一看，地下流着一片鮮紅的血，我以爲是人力車被軋翻了，汽車又軋傷了人了；但是，不，鮮紅的血很使我害怕，我不敢看，但越是不敢看，那心裏的好奇心却加倍的鼓動着，於是我就走過去。到了那人羣裏，一看，原來是一個中年的貧婦像昏迷一樣的坐在那片血泊裏。——我不敢看那張痛苦極端的臉；這情景，我立刻心悸坤起來，血，鮮紅的血使我手足都酥軟了。耳邊聽見有人悄悄的低聲的說：</p>
<p>「她走到了這裏，肚痛就發作得利害，就不能走了。」</p>
<p>「她是不是就要生呀」？另外一個眉目淸秀的三十多歲的女子，皺起了眉頭的說。</p>
<p>我立刻退出來，挑着一個面貌和善的就問，：「爲什麼沒有人把她送到醫院呢」？</p>
<p>「有人去報吿了，恐怕一會兒就要來」。恰巧這也是一個北方的口音。</p>
<p>我再沒有多問一句，也不敢多看一眼，雖然我似乎很想在這裏多待一會兒，看看是否就會有人來把她送進醫院。但那時，彷彿心裏很難過，心緒很繁重，不能再那樣多站一會兒，像一個病人樣的，拖着沉重的脚步我走開去。雖然我眼裏噙着一汪淚，默默的祝福着這在馬路旁生產的婦人，同時又默祝這位嬰兒的降生，到他長大成人，幾十年後他應知道他的母親是在馬路旁把他降生；他應記得他的母親，記得這條馬路的，當他知道了這一切之後，娜他又應該怎樣的做人？做一個什麼樣的人？</p>
<p>我默默的想着，心緒煩亂又紛紜。</p>
<p>這一天晚上回家後我一直是默默無語？思想和感情嚴肅而沉重。我的母親還以為我在辦公室裏又有什麼不愉快的事，可是我只微微的苦笑，也不能解釋。因爲對於這時代，這社會種種人的生活的方式和情景，這人羣的大的苦難，須要解釋的實在太多呵，——我只有沉默。</p>
<h3>夜空</h3>
<p>— 史虹</p>
<p>每天，我渴待黃昏從槐樹葉的隙間灑下，我要倚住窗櫺，和星空低語。</p>
<p>月白風淸之夜，繁星從天空出現了。簇擁着，綴滿了珊瑚珠的禮服閃爍着，像齊赴一個海灘上的夜會。北極星是主人，斗星是他的巨兕，他醉了，星光閃閃地，像酒後動人的笑靨，像美麗而朦朧的醉眸。</p>
<p>一條銀白的光帶，流經蒼穹中的央，這是天河。牠的兩旁更密集地倚坐着些光輝眩目的星羣；是酒酣耳熱之後，臨淸流而濯足呢，或是曲水流觴，效那人間的韻事？</p>
<p>一道弧光劃過天空，在人間看見一顆星星殞落了。是因女兒們的體嬌力弱，不勝酒後的恣情狂笑，而香消玉殞了呢，或是伊多情放浪，以致干犯了天條，被謫到人間來了？</p>
<p>這一切，我不想知道，不求回答的問語不是更完整嗎。我倚在窗前，但是，我聽得他們的軟語輕笑，和擊節而歌，我的心靈被飄飄忽忽地牽引得悠遠又悠遠，彷彿漸漸地和他們合在一起了。</p>
<p>於是，我翻開了宇宙的神秘的書籍，體染了偉大和渺小，短暫和永恒，生命底有在的意義。</p>
<p>直到獵人星魁偉地出現的時候，夜會的主人一一握別了來客的手，帶着困倦和興奮，訂定了第二天的的會。獵人星，是專司，除殘餚的僕歐吧？</p>
<p>啓明星從槐樹的枝梢譏誚着我的竊聽，　把窗扇關了。我分潤了醉意，正像剛從一個陌生的宴會回來。</p>

<h3>「體育節」的話</h3>
<p>— 蔡志偉</p>
<p>今日是體育節。</p>
<p>在個人方面，欲發展事業，必須要使身體健康；在國家方面，欲强國，必須國民身體健康，所謂强身便能强種，進而步入强國之途，即在於此。</p>
<p>上海學校雖十分發達，但以弄堂房子做校舍，而沒有運動塲的學校，還是多數，這是一個嚴重問題。上海體育人土，應想出辦法來，如幾所學校合用一個運動塲，務使一般靑年·兒童·有鍛鍊體格的機會，欲使上海學校體育納入正軌，敎育當局應予以指導與協助。對於學校體育的教材，亦應有研究及商討改善的必要。</p>
<p>目前上海體育界，有二大問題，須待解決：</p>
<p>（一）人才個題：上海的體育人才，過去爲數極多，但有的現已倦勤，有的已年老退休，因學校的發達，體育敎師如以中學二人小學一人計，亦需要上千的體育敎師，更以民衆團體需要大量的體育指導人才，故上海體育人才更形缺乏，爲上海體育着想，市府應多設體專，及獎勵私立體專的設立，培植人才，以解決人才的恐慌。</p>
<p>（二）經費問題：俗日「巧婦難煮無米飯」，上海體育界，雖具有良好的制度及計劃，但往往因經費之不足，而不能從事發展，故政府應將國民體育經費列入預算，予以合理的分配額。上海體育界若有了充裕的經濟，便能充實體育設備，發展體育事業，在幾年內，上海的體育必能發展到理想的境地</p>
<p>至於。其他塲地設備等問題，皆與經濟問題有關，無待贅言</p>
<h3>談托兒所</h3>
<p>— 兪珊</p>
<p>—爲幼幼托兒所呼籲</p>
<p>一樹豐盛的果實，吃的人只知道香甜，可沒想到種樹人的辛苦。孩子長大，成了一個甚麼樣的人，有些父母也沒想到是他們自已的責任。總算國家添設了托兒所，保育院！要是每個所院都能負起這重要的使命，也許仍然還是感到不够容量，何况有些所院無非是一般太太借它爲虛榮的名譽獎章呢！這不僅是每個人都應該注意到的，而且確是民族興亡婦女解放重要唯一的使命。</p>
<p>我也何嘗不是爲了必需自己工作吃飯，常常都是忽略對孩子的照顧？想到他們將來急迫需要安置他們在一個適常的寄所，參觀了不少的所院，最後才找到了他們甜靜的家園，新創辦不到一年的幼幼托兒所，正是他倆暫時的家鄕。爲了房子的限制，僅僅只能收容八十個兒童，在每個孩子的健康活潑的表現上，已够證實創辦人完成了這偉大使命。兒童每天可以吃到水菓牛奶鷄蛋等五餐的飲食，尤爲難得的是我每次去都看到所長葉叔珂女士親自監視着兒童日常一切的生活。最近尙聘到研究兒童心理的專家，帮助她照料所中一切的事務。他們隨時都是虛心地研究兒童保育的方法。所裏的保姆和工作人員也都和藹可親，唯一美中不足是這小小樂園的經費很值得葉女士苦心籌措，尙有二十多登過記的兒童，爲了沒有房子不够不能進來，因爲這座樂園，祗是一所三層小樓房。在經濟方面，也沒有得到任何機關的補助。而對於兒童的膳宿費收價郤極低廉，八十兒童中尙有于名免費的兒童。有一個無父的小孩，母親失業，又在病中，不僅三四個月未交付膳宿費，連衣服都是所裏供給的。我曾經抱過還可憐的孩子。她郤是胖胖很可愛的，和我說笑過。</p>
<p>因此種種迫切需要，幼幼托兒所董事會董事長商震夫人宋英及吳國楨，潘公展，杜月笙，陳其采諸先生羣力領導和扶助，準備在本月中旬假黃金劇院義演籌募基金。我深爲葉女士這樣慈愛偉大的服務精神所感動，深覺這一事意義的深長。我爲幼幼托兒所的前途及二十多名登記了的兒童祝福，我期望此次的義演，能得到各界踴躍響應的援助！</p>
<h3>深夜違章營業</h3>
<p>— 錄自光緒十九年八月廿五日本報</p>
<p>警察局對於娛樂塲所營業時間，本有限制，但仍有不法之徒，暗中延長時間，若為警局所查悉，則予以相當懲處。查五十年前，亦有類似之事發生，惟不爲舞塲而戒烟館耳。</p>

<h3>明年的一一　世界運動會</h3>
<p>— 白石譯</p>
<p>除了德國和日本以外，世界各國都已得到了「第十四屆世界運動大會籌備委員會」的邀請，去參加一九四八年七月廿九日至八月十四日將在倫敦舉行的盛會。</p>
<p>會期離現在雖然還有一年，但那許多籌備委員早已在愉敦着手工作了。在一九四八年的夏天，英國本部仍難免要受到戰後物資缺乏的影響，可是英國政府已決定要使那五千名左右的選手和大會職員李受到「最好的一切」。</p>
<p>舉行種種比賽的運動場地，早已在準備起來了。位於大倫敦西北部的「韋姆勃雷體育塲」，本是英國的最好戶外競技場所，現在正在構築幾百間更衣室，其中有雨淋浴，熱水節頭等等舒服設備。在今後一年內，將建築一只全新的露天游泳池，許多的新公園和停車塲，一條「舒展筋骨」的預習跑道和通往該體育塲的新的大道。</p>
<p>「韋姆勃雷體育塌」在亞述，愛爾文爵士主特之下，對於各種盛會的籌備工作，一是做得十分透澈，絲毫不娛的。它將使十萬位觀衆滿意地看到一切的競技和比賽。就在附近的「帝國池」上，將要構築一個鬥拳台；鬥拳的節目一吿結束，就有大批的熟練工人去拆毀那個台塲，幾在一夜間把那游泳池佈置好。</p>
<p>不適於在「韋奶勃雷」舉行的各種比賽，則將利用其他名聞全球的戶外運動塲所。例如劃船——與賽者須自帶他們的獨木舟去——將在「亨雷·麗嘉泰」河上競賽；脚踏車將在倫敦南部，著名的「赫倫山徑」上比賽，而射擊比賽則在「別斯溜」舉行。至少可容三百名籃球選手的頭等健身房，還沒有找到；而摔角比賽也有其特殊的問題、因爲世界遝動會規定大小的那種草蓆，英國並沒有出產。</p>
<p>最後要說到準備那「奧林此亞火炬」了。籌備會的燃料研究部正設計，預備用一面巨大的擴大鏡，在希臘北部的奧林伯斯峯上，集中太陽的光線來燃點一支火炬。這火炬將不問風雨晝夜，由各國的運動家「接力賽跑地擎着，馳過歐洲，在大會開幕的一天到達「韋姆勃雷體育塲」，用以燃點那「奧林比亞燄火」—這燄火將在開會期間，日夜爲全體觀衆和選手所望見，</p>
<p>啟：今日稿擠「旅美什錦」暫停一天。</p>
<p>頑貓阿咪　（廿四）　張樂平作</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>拙劣的間諜片「玫瑰多刺」</p>
<p>如果你不健忘的話，你總還記得淪陷時期那張宣傳大東亞的影片「春江遺恨」，那就是岳楓與敵人聯合導演的。</p>
<p>現在這部「玫瑰多刺」的導演就是岳楓。</p>
<p>如果我們還承認電影是敎育民衆的武器，那末同一個人導演的影片，以「春江遺恨」到現在「玫瑰多刺」，觀衆會發生怎樣的影響？難道電影　眞是黑暗的嗎？</p>
<p>我們再來　這部「玫瑰多刺」，它描為重慶的諜報人員與　僞的特務作　，然而由於故事編製的架空，內容太缺少了眞實，男主角陸家良從重慶的諜報人員變節到偽方特務關子萬三爺，毫無過程，使人不易了解，最後李靜丹兩夜混入萬公館投彈，那完全是空想與兒戲。總之是拙劣的問諜戲。</p>
<p>演員：羅蘭初上銀幕，有此成績極爲不易，嚴化過火而浮躁。</p>
<p>一個坤伶的浮沉錄——「天橋」</p>
<p>這部戲是描寫一個坤伶的浮沉錄，作者透過了坤伶花小鳳的身世，勾劃出這個社會的黑暗而，但由於作者取材較雜較多，所以反而不能集中，故事也太長，以戰前寫到了戰後，這裏包括了表揚老伶工穆鴻春的忠貞不渝，與一些舊劇伶人的堅貞不屈，流根地痞的橫行不法，勾結敵僞，花小鳳的受騙與出走以至最後墮落。但是，這些在作者的筆下，都只有浮光掠影的描寫，並沒有從深處去發掘，所以不能留給觀衆較深的印象。</p>
<p>導演對戲的處理·難還　　·但顯得無力，那些平劇塲面旣呆板而又枯燥，同時對戲的理解也較浮淺，只把劇淸流暢的搬演出來，這是一個匠人而非藝術家。</p>
<p>杜　珠初上銀幕，演技雖較生硬，大體上是可以作爲稱職的，這是一個可造之材，前途極有希望。言少朋不很自然，但也並不十分過火，這是一個新演員所不易做到的。徐緩的豐四太太，是全劇中最佳的一個演員了。</p>
<p>王元龍的戲尙穩健尋職。</p>
<p>傳記片「藍色狂想曲」</p>
<p>「藍色狂想曲」是部傳記片，它描寫美國近代音樂家喬治葛許溫的一生事蹟，與最近在上映的「　漢笙歌」可稱爲姊妹作。我們不去談這二位音樂家的成績，單以劇本來說，那末這部「藍色狂想曲」是更富於戲劇性的，雖然那個三角戀愛故事大大的　助了這劇本的濃厚戲劇性，而喬治葛許溫的一生事蹟在編劇者的處理不也是異當人情味而生動的。</p>
<p>演出上，導演的成績是不能算作成功的，許多塲而都處理得極爲鬆弛。</p>
<p>演喬治葛許溫的洛勃亞爾達。相當的不錯，據說這還是初上銀暮的新演員，那更是難能可費，瓊蘭蓮絲的表麗，生動而可愛。亞立克茜史密絲的克　　，度極佳。</p>
<p>此片的樂樂是値得一聽的。</p>
<p>「血海忠魂」與「傘兵血戰萊茵河」</p>
<p>「血海忠魂」是美國一家小影片公司攝製的，技術上甚為簡陋，劇本題材陳舊，演員也無較佳的成績。另一片「傘兵血戰萊茵河「是英國「　獅」發行的戰爭紀錄片。戲極樸素。但少精彩。此片能連賣滿座，實在是明了「假鳳虛鳳」的光。</p>

<h3>Chairman Returns to Nanjing from Guling in the Rain; Urges Party and Youth League to Concentrate Efforts and Thoroughly Eliminate Past Bad Habits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 8th] The Chairman, accompanied by his wife, left Guling at 10 a.m. on the 8th to return to Nanjing. Before departing, representatives of the people of Lushan and heads of various institutions stood waiting in the rain outside Gate No. 10 on the right side of the official residence. Considering the heavy rain and fog, the Chairman did not wish to keep the well-wishers waiting for long, so he instructed his aide to inform them that the plane had not yet arrived and the departure date was uncertain. The well-wishers then dispersed. Shortly after, the Chairman and his wife, along with Yu Jishi and others, left the official residence by sedan chair. The people, upon hearing the news, returned to wait and bid farewell. The Chairman wore a coat and mandarin jacket with a casual hat, sitting upright in a black, covered mountain sedan chair, with a smile on his face, nodding in acknowledgment. Wang Lingji and the guards proceeded down the mountain ahead of them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, returned to Nanjing by special plane at 1:30 p.m. on the 8th, landing at Ming Palace Airport. The Chairman had gone to Guling on the 31st of last month to escape the summer heat. Upon disembarking the plane on the 8th, he appeared composed and serene. Especially, the Chairman now wore a blue coat and mandarin jacket, further enhancing his kindly appearance. The Madame wore a dark blue Western-style suit and was full of vigor. Xue Yue, Chiang Ching-kuo, Zhu Huadui, and several others were present at the airport to greet them. The Chairman greeted them all with a nod. He then boarded a car and returned to the official residence. The accompanying staff arrived in Nanjing on the "Daxiong" plane five minutes later, including Yu Jishi and Cao Shengfen.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chiang, also holding the title of Corps Commander, arrived at the Second Plenary Session of the Youth Corps at 5:30 p.m. on the 8th and delivered instructions to the attendees, the main points of which were: (1) Regarding the request of the Party and Youth League to change their names, he believed that the Chinese Kuomintang had decades of glorious history and should not be changed hastily. (2) After the unified organization of the Chinese Youth Corps, it would form a new force. Party and Youth League cadres should concentrate their efforts to eliminate the past bad habits of the Party. (3) He himself had not been able to personally pay attention to the training affairs of the Youth League in the past. He would personally provide guidance in the future, speaking with sincere words. The Chairman also emphasized: We must clearly recognize our goals, recognize the times, and the environment, to determine the methods of handling affairs. It must be known that we must unite our will and concentrate our efforts to eliminate the Communist Party and complete the task of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. During the Chairman's instructions, the attendees applauded enthusiastically several times, expressing their highest respect.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Youth Corps held an all-day meeting on the 8th, which concluded at approximately 11 p.m., and it was decided to adjourn temporarily. The conference will resume after the Fourth Plenary Session concludes. During the meeting on the 8th, in addition to passing four important cases, the implementation measures for the unified organization of the Party and Youth League and the outline of the Party's reconstruction were discussed. During the afternoon session, before Chairman Chiang delivered his speech, he listened to the opinions of the attendees. Six people, including Zheng Tianxi, offered their opinions, stating that they hoped the unified organization of the Party and Youth League could achieve thorough reform, fulfill the leader's hopes, and thoroughly eliminate past bad habits. Chairman Chiang then delivered his instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] On the evening of the 8th, the Chairman summoned Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Bu Lizhi, Wu Tiecheng, Hong Lanyou, and other key Party and government officials to his official residence, and inquired in detail about the unified organization of the Party and Youth League.</p>
<h3>Fourth Plenary Session and Joint Conference of Party and Youth League Solemnly Inaugurated; President Chiang Presides Personally and Delivers Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Kuomintang Central Plenary Session was solemnly inaugurated in Nanjing at 9 a.m. on the 9th, the anniversary of the first revolutionary uprising led by the Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. President Chiang presided personally and delivered important instructions. This plenary session is the first important meeting within the Party since the reorganization of the government and the Kuomintang's position as an ordinary political party. Especially at the beginning of the implementation of the unified organization of the Party and Youth League, it has epoch-making significance in both political and party affairs. As the Party and government are unified, the attendees consist of both Party members and Youth League members, integrated in one hall. The purpose of their unity is no different from the past. The plenary session, which has historical value, was held in the National Assembly Hall, where a constitution for a century-long plan was formulated. The hall was designed by experts, with a combination of light and color, making it extremely beautiful. The entrance was marked with "Kuomintang Fourth Plenary Session," and the Party flag was hung. Inside, Party and national flags were interspersed on all four walls, with Party and national emblems competing for brilliance. The walls were also adorned with gilded slogans of unity and struggle. The atmosphere of the meeting hall was considered appropriately harmonious. Furthermore, the agenda of this plenary session is only attached to the "Outline of the New Construction of the Party" case. Other proposals that do not belong to the unified organization of the Party and Youth League will not have a separate proposal review committee; the presidium will decide to report them to the general assembly. The agenda for the next few days is tentatively scheduled as follows: 8 a.m. on the 9th, opening ceremony, preparatory meeting (election of the presidium and other meeting affairs); in the afternoon, Wu Tiecheng will report on the process of the unified organization of the Party and Youth League, Zhang Qun will report on politics and diplomacy, and Bai Chongxi will report on military affairs. Joint meetings of the Party and Youth League will be held all day on the 10th and 11th. The conference will discuss the agenda on the 12th and 13th, and the closing ceremony may be held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Joint Conference of the Central Party and Youth League will be held jointly at 9 a.m. on the 9th at the National Assembly Hall, simultaneously commemorating the anniversary of the first uprising led by the Premier. The opening ceremony will be presided over by President Chiang himself. After the ceremony, a preparatory meeting will be held to determine the candidates for the presidium and other related meeting matters. Each provincial and municipal Party headquarters and Youth League headquarters has sent two representatives to the meeting. As of 6 p.m. tonight, a total of 201 people have registered with the conference. Together with the staff of the central government departments and the representatives of various provincial and municipal Party headquarters, there are more than 500 people. Many others are en route to Nanjing and will continue to register upon arrival.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] Informed sources said that when addressing the Fourth Plenary Session, the Chairman will call on Kuomintang members to implement all possible measures to quell the Communist bandits. It is also learned that the National Government is drafting several regulations to protect surrendered Communist personnel in accordance with Article 15 of the General Mobilization Law, which will include the following: (1) Those who voluntarily break away from the Communist Party and pledge allegiance to the National Government will be granted freedom and full rights. (2) The government will not punish Communist soldiers who voluntarily lay down their weapons. (3) Those who are threatened or abused in the Communist areas and bring Communist information into the National Army areas will be protected. Those who voluntarily seek out Communist information will also be protected. (4) All Communist Party members should be subject to one year of ideological education and one year of labor service. Those who surrendered before or after the implementation of the General Mobilization Law, and whose actions do not harm the government, may be exempt from ideological education and labor service. (5) Surrendered Communist Party members should register with the local government authorities.</p>
<h3>Strict Review of Candidates for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Elections by Vocational Groups; Ministry of Social Affairs Cables Provinces and Cities to Prevent Abuses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The quota of representatives to be elected by vocational groups in this general election has been announced. Regarding the selection of vocational candidates for the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan, Zheng Che, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Social Affairs, told reporters: The Ministry hopes that the National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members elected this time will be genuine practitioners of their respective professions, so that the opinions of each profession can be reflected in future national policies, fully demonstrating the spirit of democratic politics. The Ministry has telegraphed all provinces and cities, requiring strict review of the candidates for vocational National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members, and making efforts to prevent abuses. It is imperative to encourage genuine practitioners of each profession to participate in the election, especially farmers and workers, so as to prevent ordinary officials and individuals who have no connection with farmers and workers from abusing the system.</p>
<h3>Quota for Industrial and Commercial Groups</h3>
<p>Election Committee of Vocational Groups and Women's Groups</p>
<p>Telegraphs Government to Expedite Decision</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Election Committee of the National Vocational Groups and Women's Groups Election Office held its third meeting at the Ministry of Social Affairs at 4 p.m. today. Committee members Huang Youying, Jiang Zuoping, Tong Xiaoyu, and others attended, chaired by Chairman Gu Zhenggang. The following important cases were resolved: (1) Although the government has announced detailed regulations for the allocation of quotas for vocational groups, the quota for industrial and commercial groups has not yet been decided due to quota issues, and the increase in allocation has not been announced, which has greatly affected the progress of the entire vocational election. Another telegram will be sent to the general office to expedite the government's decision. (2) The supplementary explanation on election procedure issues sent by the general office stipulates that voter lists and voting rights certificates are universal for the National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members, which is difficult to implement. According to the regulations of the two election laws, those with more than two electoral rights can choose one. Therefore, participation in the regional election or vocational election of the National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members should be allowed to be determined by themselves. If they participate in the vocational election during the National Assembly representative election, and participate in the regional election during the Legislative Yuan member election, the voters will inevitably change greatly, and the voter registration dates for the National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members are two months apart. During this period, the number of members and the number of groups change greatly due to the expiration of membership and the increase or decrease of groups. The two voter lists should still be made separately. As for the voting rights certificate for vocational elections, if the regional or vocational group is changed during the National Assembly election or the Legislative Yuan election, the voter should apply to the local application agency for a stamp before it can be applied. (3) The registration of candidates for National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members elected by national vocational groups and women's groups only requires the submission of a nomination signature book of candidates according to law, and the verification is based on the voter list. According to Article 9 of the Election and Recall Implementation Regulations, the voter list is made in duplicate by the competent election authorities, one copy submitted to the higher competent authority for record. The election affairs of national groups are handled by the election offices of various counties and cities. Except for municipalities directly under the central government, the election authorities are all at the third level. If the voter list is submitted to this office for record, the county and city must prepare three copies, whether it is consistent with the regulations, whether there is any difficulty in fact, are all problems. It is decided not to make another copy of the list and forward it to the national vocational and women's election office. However, for the convenience of examination, a supplementary regulation is made for the candidate registration examination procedures for verification. The methods are as follows: 1. When applying for registration, candidates for National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members shall submit their membership card and employment certificate in addition to the nomination signature book of candidates. 2. For those registered in the national vocational and women's election office, whether the candidates and signatories meet the regulations shall be listed separately by the office according to their affiliated groups and sent to the election offices of various provinces and cities for verification and reporting. For those registered in the election offices of various provinces and cities, the signatories who belong to this province and city shall be verified by the office itself and reported to the office. Those who belong to other provinces and cities shall be listed separately by the election office handling the registration and sent to the election offices of other provinces and cities for verification and direct reporting to the office. 3. The election office of the province and city where the candidate's group is located shall fill in the verification of the candidate's situation when reporting the list of candidates and add comments. (4) Railway, seafarer, salt industry, mining, highway, and telecommunications trade unions are trade unions organized without administrative regions. Their National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members are all elected jointly nationwide. However, these special trade unions, such as railway trade unions and highway trade unions, are organized according to the respective routes. Salt industry trade unions and mining trade unions are also organized according to the respective salt fields and mining areas. This is different from ordinary trade unions. In addition to being handled according to the regulations of the two election implementation regulations and the election precautions of vocational groups and women's groups, it is also necessary to supplement the election matters to facilitate the election. The supplementary precautions are as follows: 1. For railway, seafarer, salt industry, mining highway and telecommunications trade unions, if the organizational area crosses counties and cities, the election affairs (including the preparation and public announcement of the voter list, the issuance of voting rights certificates, and the counting of votes) shall be handled by the election authorities where the branch or group of the trade union is located. If the organizational area is within the county and city, it shall be handled by the election authorities where the meeting place is located. 2. For trade unions that cross counties and cities, the branch or group shall register the members of each branch or group who wish to participate in vocational elections. For public associations within the county and city, the members of the public association who wish to participate in vocational elections shall be registered separately and sent to the local election authorities. After the votes are counted, a list of winning candidates and the number of votes shall be announced and reported by the election office of each province to the national vocational and women's election office, and the winners and alternates shall be determined. (5) The color, paper, font, and explanation of the election tickets for vocational groups and women's groups have been re-determined in accordance with the detailed allocation method of the quota for vocational groups issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs, reported to the general office for record, and ordered to be followed.</p>
<h3>To Prevent Smuggling in South China, Import and Export Commission Establishes South China Branch; Zhang Jia'ao to Inspect Guangzhou After Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] In order to prevent smuggling in South China and the evasion of overseas remittances, the Central Government has established a South China branch of the Import and Export Management Committee. The person in charge has been requested by the committee to appoint Zhu Huiri, a representative of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, as the chairman, and Tian Dingan, secretary of the Fourth Joint Office, as the deputy chairman. Tian returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 8th to arrange official affairs and to ask the Central Government for instructions. He will go to Shanghai and then Guangzhou on the 9th. According to Tian, the smuggling of imports and exports and the evasion of overseas remittances in South China are like a tumor in the human body. If it is not removed, it will endanger the entire life. Recently, both the government and the public have attached great importance to this. During this period of fiscal and economic reform, the government should take active and passive measures to strictly restrict the rampant smuggling situation in South China. The South China branch is organized by relevant central and local agencies, and the Hong Kong side has also agreed to provide assistance. In the future, mutual assistance and promotion will make the import and export trade and overseas remittances return to normal, so as to block loopholes. It is also learned that Zhang Jia'ao will go to Guangzhou after the Fourth Plenary Session to supervise the implementation of the work.</p>

<h3>Coordinate with Saving Consumption; Seek Rationalization of Production; National Economic Commission Drafting Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The National Economic Commission is drafting a rationalization method for production institutions to coordinate with the saving consumption method. Minister of Social Affairs Gu told reporters today that it is urgent to launch a rationalization movement for production, but this work is not easy because China has never attached importance to factory management, and the objects of management, such as machinery and environment, have not been discussed, resulting in the failure of various factories to have the same standards. If we want to rationalize production, we must improve it from the root. Gu said at the end: I hope that this method can have good results. The reporter then asked for his opinion on the saving consumption method, whether it is possible to achieve the effect of the British quantitative distribution in the past? He replied that the method is very good, but it cannot be compared with the UK because all materials in the UK are imported from abroad, and the government has full control, which is different from the scattered materials in our country, and the British are ashamed of violating the law and uphold the virtue of abiding by the law, while China is the opposite, so there will inevitably be some trouble when implementing it, and I hope that the opinion circles can create a trend and improve this kind of accumulated habits to achieve the purpose of saving consumption. It is also learned that the personnel reduction and supplies registration matters of various agencies are being rushed by various agencies, and can be sent to the government for approval in the budget.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan's 20th Meeting Approves Establishment of Post-Relief Affairs Commission; Continuing UNRRA/CNRRA to Complete the Great Plan for Reviving Agriculture; Patent Law to Take Effect on New Year's Day of Next Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang made the following remarks on the establishment of the Post-Relief Affairs Commission approved at today's Executive Yuan meeting: Because UNRRA/CNRRA is about to end, and after UNRRA ends, the originally planned long-term post-relief professional plans cannot be completed in a few years, such as the Yellow River Flood Area Revival Project, fisheries post-relief, mechanized farming and agricultural tool manufacturing, and rural industrial demonstration, etc., which have been established by UNRRA/CNRRA with considerable foundation. In order to complete this unfinished project and achieve complete success, our government has specially organized this commission, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and its significance is very important. A deliberation and custody committee is set up under the commission, and its members are in three aspects: (1) government representatives, (2) domestic elders with social prestige, and (3) people recommended by UNRRA or similar institutions run by the United Nations. This is not only an expression of our government's emphasis on the unfinished plans of UNRRA, but also a new method of international cooperation. It is initiated automatically by our government, and it is unique among countries that accept UNRRA materials. It provides an opportunity for donor countries to cooperate and assist in completing the plan within the premise of the integrity of our administrative system, which is a new test. The main business of the Post-Relief Affairs Commission is the great plan for agricultural revival, which is not only specially emphasized and promoted by our government, but also optimistic about by international interested parties. The main point is that when this plan is completed, it will greatly increase the benefits for the majority of the people, because this is not enough to talk about revival.</p>

<h3>Factional Strife in Singapore</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang of This Newspaper</p>
<p>— Fourth Installment of Post-Flight Notes on Inspecting Southeast Asia by China Airlines</p>
<p>Speaking of the factional divisions and lack of unity in various parts of Southeast Asia, Singapore can be taken as a representative example. Apart from the activities of the Kuomintang, the Democratic League, and the Communist Party, the fragmentation of the various dialect groups is so extreme that one almost feels completely bewildered.</p>
<p>After the war, the power of the "Malayan Communist Party" (MCP) grew daily, almost to the point of controlling the entire Malaya. The sole reason for this was that during the period of Malaya's fall, the Communist Party seized the opportunity to organize the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," widely launching underground work. As a result, they obtained firearms supplied by the British, and also seized some weapons from the Japanese army. Gradually, it became an armed and powerful army. Although the British returned to Malaya after the victory and repeatedly attempted to recover the firearms from the "Malayan Communist Party," the number scattered in northern Malaya remained large, and to this day, the British are still helpless.</p>
<p>Currently, the "Malayan Communist Party" has two external organizations: the "New Democratic Youth League" and a "branch of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army," which are led by the MCP leader Zhang Mingjin. In the early days of victory, during the period before the British had fully arrived, the "Malayan Communist Party" attempted to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to control the entire overseas Chinese society, even resorting to coercive measures to prohibit overseas Chinese from hanging the national flag, stipulating that they must uniformly hang the Soviet flag and the three-colored flag of their "Malayan Communist Party." However, the "Malayan Communist Party" did not expect that at the time, people's hearts were vigorous and overseas Chinese had great confidence in their motherland. As a result, they overreached themselves and not only failed to achieve their goal but also lost the support of the people. The "Malayan Communist Party" regarded this incident at the time as a fatal blow to their prestige.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, in the last two years, the "Malayan Communist Party" has gradually raised its head again, taking advantage of the Labor Party's rule in Britain and the environment of democratic freedom. Their activities in various labor unions have controlled all the behind-the-scenes work. Looking at the recent general labor unrest in Malaya, it is all supported by the "Malayan Communist Party" behind the scenes. They not only propagandize for the labor unrest but also provide a large amount of money as backing.</p>
<p>However, so far, although the "Malayan Communist Party" does not have a newspaper, it cleverly uses the Democratic League's official newspaper, "Nanyang Daily," as its indirect mouthpiece. The "Democratic League," on the other hand, despite having an official newspaper that shouts loudly all day long, does not have any real power. According to general estimates, there are no more than a hundred members of the Democratic League in Malaya. If one wants to clearly understand how much influence the Democratic League has, one can get a general idea from Chen Jiageng's remarks. In a meeting between a reporter and Chen Jiageng, Chen Jiageng said: "Although the Democratic League has prestige and status, it has no power and can only echo others sometimes." Chen Jiageng himself is openly opposed to the government in Singapore. From his tone, one can see that the old man's opinions are stubborn, and he still maintains his subjective views on domestic politics. Although he returned to the rear of the motherland during the Anti-Japanese War and visited Yan'an, he still cannot understand the general political situation in the country.</p>
<p>The reporter once asked Chen Jiageng: "Is the factional struggle among overseas Chinese detrimental to the overseas Chinese themselves? Should factional struggles withdraw from overseas Chinese organizations?" Chen Jiageng believed that the main reason for the lack of unity among overseas Chinese was due to the domestic conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the domestic political struggle is not eliminated, overseas Chinese will not be able to embark on the path of unity.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chen Jiageng himself, although he still possesses the influence of the Fujian dialect group, it is far less than before the war. Some people, although they clearly know that his actions are wrong, do not publicly oppose him out of consideration for past personal relationships or because some of them are his subordinates. During the Anti-Japanese War, Chen Jiageng used the Nanyang Relief General Association as a tool for his political activities, even recently sending a telegram to President Truman requesting the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China, still using the name of the Nanyang Relief General Association. Now some people have pointed out that the Relief General Association is an organization that can be concluded after the war. If this name is used for activities again, it goes beyond the scope, and some people even demand that the old man disclose the past accounts. This matter caused a great uproar in Singapore at the time, but Chen Jiageng never made a clear statement. Although some people have publicly stated that the funds of the Relief General Association have been mostly diverted to funds for running newspapers and publicity.</p>
<p>In addition, let's take a look at the commercial situation in the overseas Chinese society, which is a scene of desolation and cannot be compared with the pre-war period. The main reasons are the fall in rubber prices and the war in the Dutch East Indies, which have become fatal injuries. At the same time, in this depressed scene, the cost of living is five times higher than before the war. Therefore, overseas Chinese are forced by livelihood and have gradually lost interest in politics. Although some people inevitably echo the left wing, it is actually just a "fashionable game." So, the conclusion can be said that the current real interests of overseas Chinese are all placed on how to obtain stability in life and how to revive their inherent economic position.</p>

<h3>The Asia East Association Releases Opinions on the Treaty with Japan, Advocating for a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting First</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Asia East Association, which studies Japanese issues, held a reception for reporters at its Liyang Road headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday, releasing the association's opinions on the treaty with Japan. The reception was hosted by the association's director He Yaozu and the chairman of the publicity committee, Shao Yulin. First, He delivered a speech, elaborating on the association's opinions on the treaty with Japan, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the procedure of the treaty with Japan, it advocates for a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union first, and then convene a Far East Eleven-Nation Foreign Ministers' Meeting based on the decisions of the four foreign ministers. If the Soviet Union does not participate, China should consider its attitude anew, based on the spirit of independence and autonomy.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the issue of Japanese territory, it supports the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration. However, from China's standpoint, it should theoretically advocate for the return of the Ryukyu Islands to China.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of the Japanese standard of living, it disagrees with the provision that the future Japanese industrial standard should be set in 1930-34, as this is tantamount to recognizing Japan's militaristic economic system. Based on the opinions of the people and experts, it advocates that the industrial standard should be determined based on the standard of living. The future Japanese standard of living should be based on 1928, the year Japan launched the Huanggutun Incident, and be appropriately converted so as not to exceed or threaten the survival of the people of any East Asian country. Under this provision, the Japanese people can survive and prosper, and the survival of the people of East Asian countries will be less threatened. There are economic, political, and East Asian collective security reasons for this.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the issue of the Japanese Emperor, it confirms that the "Emperor" is the talisman of theocratic politics, and theocratic politics is the home of militarism. It advocates that the Emperor system should be changed. Even if the Japanese people are willing to retain its existence, it should be renamed "King" to avoid hindering the future of Japan's democratic system.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the issue of compensation, it recognizes that the core of all treaty terms is compensation, so these opinions feel that the principles proposed for the compensation terms and the proportion of compensation China should receive are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>He then reported on the association's organization and future work. After he finished, Shao Yulin put forward some supplementary opinions. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Social Affairs Revises the Factory Law to Expand the Scope of Application and Improve Salary Payment Methods</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper on the 8th] The Factory Law has been in effect for a long time, and much of its content is not in line with actual needs. It has now been revised by the Ministry of Social Affairs and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the main points of the revision are as follows: (1) Expanding the scope of application: Article 1 of the Factory Law is revised to "All factories that use powered machinery and regularly employ 30 or more workers, or factories that do not use powered machinery but regularly employ 60 or more workers, may also use this law," so that all workers using powered machinery can also enjoy legal protection. (2) Determining the competent authority: The original Article 2 stated that "The competent authority referred to in this law shall be the municipal government in cities and the county government in counties, unless otherwise specified," is revised to "The competent authority referred to in this law shall be the Ministry of Social Affairs in the central government, and the administrative authorities in provinces, cities, and counties." (3) Regulations on wage payment: The original Article 23 stipulated that "Wages shall be paid on a regular basis, at least twice a month, and the same shall apply to wages calculated on a piecework basis." The revised version adds "Wages that are paid on a regular basis in the preceding paragraph shall be paid in advance in the event of a rest day. When a worker is dismissed or dies, his wages shall be paid immediately." (4) Factory inspection: The Factory Law did not originally list factory inspection, so the following article is added: "The inspection matters after the implementation of this law shall be determined by law separately."</p>

<h3>The "Three-No-Man's-Land" on the North Bank of the Yangtze River; Local People Demand to Restore Their Original Domicile</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 8th] The junction of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces on the north bank of the Yangtze River has now become a "three-no-man's-land." Since the Yuan, Ming, Qing dynasties and the Republic of China, these areas have belonged to Pengze and Jiujiang counties of Jiangxi Province. In 1936, due to the proposal of Kong Xiangxi, then Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Fengkuo Township, Tuanbanzhou, and other places were divided and assigned to Huangmei County of Hubei Province, Susong County of Anhui Province, etc. However, due to the incompatibility of local customs and inconvenience in transportation and administration, a phenomenon of "three-no-man's-land" has developed. The local people have demanded to restore their original domicile. Recently, a Domicile Restoration Committee has been formed, and representatives such as Yuan Dinghua have been sent to Guling to present a petition to Chairman Jiang and Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji, stating the situation.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Leading the Nation to Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) solemnly opened today in the capital. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made a special trip back to Nanjing from Guling to personally preside over the meeting, demonstrating its importance. This plenary session is likely the last meeting of the KMT's highest executive body before returning political power to the people and implementing constitutional governance. The KMT's own reforms and the future political trends will depend on the outcome of this session. Therefore, the significance of the Fourth Plenary Session is already extraordinary. Moreover, it is being held today amidst a clamor for political and economic reforms that resounds throughout the land, making its significance even more worthy of attention from the people of the entire nation.</p>
<p>The KMT in China not only has a long and glorious history, but also has made indelible contributions to the transformation of China. Since the Revive China Society and the Tongmenghui, under the leadership of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the KMT overthrew the Manchu Qing dynasty, established the Republic of China, defeated Yuan Shikai, and recreated the Republic. Later, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the KMT eliminated the warlords and completed the unification of China. It also, on the day of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, erased the unequal treaties accumulated over a century of humiliation. These great achievements of the KMT are immortal, and no one can deny them. After the victory in the War of Resistance, due to the Communist bandits' harming of the country and its people, the fruits of victory were [illegible]. Whether in politics, economics, or society, various terrifying crises were emerging. Knowing that without another sweeping reform, the future of the nation and the people would face unimaginable adversities. Even before U.S. President Truman's special envoy, General Albert Wedemeyer, issued his statement upon leaving China, the Chinese government and the public already felt the necessity of "self-reliance." Post-war China reached such a state that it truly was a major tragedy in the history of transforming China. However, what China's future destiny will be still depends on whether the Chinese Kuomintang can lead the people of the entire nation onto the smooth path of "self-reliance." Therefore, the convening of this plenary session is of great importance to the future of the Party and the nation. In addition to wishing it success, we would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to the KMT.</p>
<p>First, although the KMT has already made immortal contributions to the nation and its people, the National Revolution it leads has only completed two-thirds of its task. One-third still requires the continued efforts of the KMT. Although the Manchu Qing dynasty has been overthrown, the warlords eliminated, Japan defeated, and all unequal treaties abolished, the problem of the Communist bandits, who commit all kinds of evil, not only has not been resolved, but is also expanding and spreading. The situation at home and abroad has forced China to take the path of "self-reliance" again. If the KMT cannot use its past revolutionary spirit and the spirit of the War of Resistance to lead the people of the entire nation to advance on the path of "self-reliance," there is a risk of failing after nearly succeeding. Therefore, all members of the KMT should invigorate their revolutionary spirit, lead the people, and complete the task of "self-reliance." We believe that only those with a full and vibrant revolutionary spirit have the courage to fear nothing, can move forward optimistically, and can overcome any current difficulties. Therefore, we hope that the gentlemen attending the Fourth Plenary Session will deeply reflect when discussing the reform plan of the Party affairs. Ask whether the magnanimity of the KMT is still present? Think about whether those elements without strong faith in the Party should be removed? The KMT members are said to number four million, focusing on quantity over quality is futile. What is the benefit of focusing on name and reality is lost? Today, launching a large-scale purge of the Party, from whatever perspective, is truly urgent.</p>
<p>Second, in the future, the task of the KMT, in addition to leading the nation to embark on the path of "self-reliance," is also to lead the people to learn the habits of democratic politics so that Chinese politics can truly embark on the right track of "democratization." People generally comment on Chinese politics by calling it "corrupt and incompetent." Even Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng said the day before yesterday that the important task of the Fourth Plenary Session is to eliminate corruption, remove incompetence, and reform politics. However, how can this goal be achieved? We believe it is very simple, in a nutshell, as long as politics can be democratized, corruption and incompetence will no longer exist. However, looking at the internal organization of the KMT, it must be said that it has not yet achieved "from the bottom up." Until now, it still maintains a top-down approach. Therefore, not only is the Party separated from the government, but also the Party headquarters is separated from the Party members. Not only are domestic talents buried, but even those within the Party with potential have no opportunity to stand out. Recently, the call for "democratization within the Party" has been rising. When the Fourth Plenary Session discusses the reform of Party affairs, it should pay special attention to the organization of lower-level Party headquarters. For this election of legislators and National Assembly representatives, it should especially refer to the methods of political party elections in various democratic countries and effectively prevent KMT members from competing with each other, in order to establish a new democratic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Third, the KMT has long been asking the government to eliminate corruption, remove incompetence, and improve administrative efficiency. It is remembered that when the KMT held the Third Plenary Session in March of this year, it also discussed this issue. At that time, if the KMT could have resolutely reformed politics thoroughly, it would not have invited General Wedemeyer's criticism, making every self-respecting person feel ashamed. After this painful lesson, this plenary session should finally make a firm determination to truly reform and start anew with the people.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also point out that otherwise, nothing can be discussed. At present, the people's livelihood is in terrible distress, beyond description. The KMT should come up with concrete measures to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood as soon as possible, so that everyone can live and work in peace. It must not delay and indulge, sitting idly by as prices soar, leading to the people's misery. If the KMT wants to maintain the trust of the people, it should start with stabilizing the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Fooling Refugees, Drawing Turtles on Clothes</h3>

<h3>Hitoshi Ashida Suddenly Changes Attitude, Cabinet's Position Shaken, Conservatives Planning a Strong New Party</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida met with reporters in Kyoto on the 6th and made an important statement, saying: "The Japanese political situation is secretly wavering. It is said that the new party organized by Jiyuto Party president Shigeru Yoshida, if successful, will attract forty to fifty defectors from the Democratic Party, while I hope only fifteen or sixteen. If more than fifteen or sixteen participate, the Party will inevitably have to consider it. Because the policies of the current Katayama cabinet have run into a wall, the current cabinet has lost the people's faith and is in a position where it must relinquish power. However, the new party must have new policies and figures, and when the fate of the Katayama cabinet will end depends on when the new party and new policies will appear." Regarding the new party being planned by Yoshida and others, and its attitude toward the imminent peace treaty with Japan, Ashida also said, "I am also deeply interested." He also said that preliminary discussions on the peace treaty with Japan will be convened after Secretary of State Marshall returns from South America, and the formal peace conference with Japan may be held as early as next spring, so Japan must actively prepare before the conference, not only in political circles but also including economic and social issues.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Minister of Agriculture Hirano, who is inspecting the agricultural situation in the Tohoku region, said on the 7th: There is no truth to the rumor that the Katayama cabinet is wavering. It is also not true that I am leaving the Socialist Party and starting a new party movement centered on farmers' unions. This is a misunderstanding based on the idea of those who worry that I must now be fully engaged in activities with national farmers' unions and that other farmers' unions will continue to emerge, believing that it is not impossible to form a farmers' party outside the Socialist Party. The current political situation is very delicate. If the Socialist Party splits, the cabinet will definitely not be able to continue, and the political influence of the Socialist Party will be greatly affected. Now is the time when the Socialist Party should exercise the most self-restraint.</p>
<h3>Issue of Establishing a Korean Provisional Government, U.S. to Submit to the UN General Assembly, U.S.-Soviet Commission Abandons Providing Joint Report</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, Washington, 8th] According to a report on the 8th, U.S. officials, long troubled by the Soviet Union's attitude towards establishing a Korean provisional government, are now planning to submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly, which will open within the month. It is reported that since the Soviet Union formally rejected the U.S. proposal to hold a four-power meeting on Korea here on the 8th, the U.S. has decided to throw the issue to the General Assembly. The Soviet reply stated that the issue of the Korean provisional government, which has been studied for about two years, "has not completely eliminated the possibility of reaching a consensus." U.S. officials believe that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission has not been able to agree on any fundamental issues and has in fact become a hopeless stalemate. Therefore, the United States proposed returning to the starting point and holding another four-power meeting of Pacific nations. The United States' request for the Soviet Union to reply to the proposal for a four-power meeting in a very short period of time is noteworthy, as the U.S. clearly hopes to receive a Soviet reply before the General Assembly convenes. Now that the Soviet reply has arrived, the United States can request the United Nations General Assembly to take action.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 8th] General Brown said: The Soviet delegation apparently did not want to reveal the fundamental disagreements regarding the organization of the Korean provisional government in the joint report. The Joint Commission has abandoned the attempt to publish this document, as both sides have many objections and reservations. Brown said: The UN delegation also attempted to withdraw "all factual statements that can describe the U.S. position and explain the main differences." The Soviet Union particularly tried to erase the reference material in the report regarding the twenty-four South Korean political parties that the Soviet Union believes are not qualified to be consulted because they are members of the anti-trusteeship committee. The U.S. suggested that the U.S. and Soviet delegations each submit their complete report, with a letter stating that neither side fully agreed with the other's report, to be signed by both sides and submitted to the U.S. and Soviet governments, but the Soviet Union also did not agree.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Expresses Dissatisfaction with the Dictatorial Style of Japanese Labor Unions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Harold, Acting Chairman of the Labor Relations Branch of the Economic and Scientific Section of the Allied Headquarters, said that some Japanese labor leaders have a "wrong idea" that workers do not have enough knowledge to plan for themselves and cannot directly elect their local or national union leaders. Currently, Japanese unions are elected by members to form a committee, and the latter elects the leaders. He wrote that many national unions in Japan still do not discuss with local branches and issue orders unilaterally. Harold emphasized that this error should be corrected, and the actions of national unions should be guided by local branches.</p>
<h3>Higashikuni Selling U.S. Cigarettes, Reaching 1.8 Billion Annually</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] An American tobacco merchant recently signed a temporary contract with the cigarette shop established by Prince Higashikuni, under which the United States will supply the store with 1.8 billion cigarettes annually. This contract can be formally established if it is approved by MacArthur's headquarters and the Ministry of Trade.</p>
<h3>Riots in Various Parts of India, Police Ordered to Kill Without Mercy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 7th] Ethnic riots broke out in the center of Delhi today, and the sound of military and police gunfire broke the silence during the curfew. Delhi's commercial center was also affected by murder and robbery, with severe damage to Muslim property. The death toll is estimated to be between three and thirty. Police have been ordered to kill without mercy in certain circumstances. The Bangalore riots have not yet subsided, with seventy-two dead and more than three hundred injured. The Calcutta and Lahore riots have not yet subsided. Gandhi has stated that if the riots do not stop immediately, he will fast to death.</p>
<p>[United Press, Karachi, 8th] As non-Muslims flee Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, at an average rate of two thousand per day, several incidents of Indian-Muslim conflict occurred again on the 8th. Two Sikhs were assassinated in their sleep at Keamari Port. Another two were thrown out of the window on a moving train. About five hundred employees of the Pakistan Autonomous Region government petitioned Jinnah, expressing concern for the safety of their relatives in New Delhi.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Personnel to Arrive in Indonesia This Weekend</h3>
<p>Van Mook Arrives in the U.S. to Meet Marshall</p>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco, 8th Radio: According to U.S. Consul General Ford, chairman of the United Nations Consular Investigation Team, military personnel from the team will begin arriving in Indonesia this weekend and will immediately begin implementing the United Nations ceasefire order for the Dutch-Indonesian dispute.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th] Dutch East Indies Governor-General Van Mook arrived here from Amsterdam today and went to Washington. He said he came to consult with the Dutch Ambassador to the United States, Eelco van Kleffens, and plans to meet with Marshall to explain the Netherlands' position on the Indonesian issue, but does not intend to present his views to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Egyptian People's Anti-British Sentiment Growing Stronger</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 7th] The Nile Valley Liberation Committee, which claims to represent various parties, issued a statement today, advocating continued fighting against Britain with various weapons in the land, sea, and air. It is claimed that we will throw the British into the sea and turn our homeland into the graveyard of imperialists. The Committee has prepared to completely withdraw Egyptian workers employed by the British army and the Suez Canal area, and to sever all economic and cultural ties with Britain.</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to Use UN General Assembly Opportunity to Launch Diplomatic War Against the Soviet Union, Australian Foreign Minister Advocates Abolishing the Veto Power</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] A U.S. authoritative source claimed that the United States will launch the most important phase of its diplomatic war against the Soviet Union at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. strategy is to try to shift the power of the United Nations from the Security Council to the 55-nation General Assembly. Because in the Security Council, the Soviet Union has the veto power and can act without fear, while in the General Assembly, the Western bloc has a firm grasp on a two-thirds majority. U.S. diplomats will move unresolved issues one by one from the Security Council to the General Assembly agenda, so this General Assembly will become a turning point for the United Nations.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 8th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, who is attending the United Nations General Assembly, made a statement en route through here, calling on "all members of the United Nations not to use the veto power and to restore the sincere coordination that is readily accepted. Unfortunately, the hopes of the people who created the United Nations are often violated, especially the fact that the Security Council cannot make decisions due to the use of the veto power, which is violated even more." Evatt recalled the harmonious atmosphere at the San Francisco conference and said, "The upcoming General Assembly should restore this harmonious spirit."</p>
<h3>Pope Urges Believers to Improve Religious Culture</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 8th] Pope Pius XII delivered a speech to more than 100,000 listeners in St. Peter's Basilica tonight, saying: At this moment, the opposition to religion has become increasingly clear, and Catholicism should take action immediately. After the Pope previously expressed support for Truman's speech advocating the establishment of a new world of peace based on Christian doctrine, he now condemned actions that oppress and persecute religion. It is believed that these words refer to the beating of a Catholic priest in Istria, which was controlled by Yugoslavia last month. Finally, the Pope also urged Catholics to dedicate themselves to improving religious culture.</p>
<h3>New Greek Cabinet Sworn In, Amnesty to Be Issued for Guerrillas</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 7th] The two-party coalition government led by Sophoulis, the 87-year-old leader of the Liberal Party, was sworn in on the 7th. The cabinet consists of 24 ministers and one deputy secretary of state. In the new cabinet, the Liberal Party, in addition to obtaining the prime minister and deputy secretary of state positions, also obtained nine other ministries. The formation of the two-party coalition government has ended the most serious political crisis in Greece since the war.</p>
<p>With the assistance of President Truman's special envoy, Henderson, the two major parties, the Liberal and People's Parties, have reached a historic understanding after a week of patient discussion. The concessions made by both government parties have led to an agreement on a moderate policy. Greek public opinion, except for the Communists, welcomes this policy, while the Communists call the new cabinet of Greece a "democratic window of American imperialism." The concession promised by the People's Party is to agree to issue an amnesty for guerrillas who lay down their arms and promise to disarm right-wing armed groups. The Liberal Party has agreed that if the aforementioned policy of leniency fails, it may take severe measures to suppress the Communists. The new government's construction plan includes launching large-scale public works to absorb unemployed people and providing guerrillas who have been pardoned with a stable life. The purpose of this policy is to weaken the Communist Party's influence on workers and farmers.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Report Indicates that Britain Is No Longer One of the Three Powers, Communist Forces Threaten Western European Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The "Washington Post" reported on the 7th: A highly confidential report from the State Department indicated that Britain is no longer one of the three powers. The State Department refused to comment on this report. According to the "Washington Post," this report from the State Department was submitted to U.S. lawmakers investigating foreign aid plans. The newspaper implied that this report may have been drafted by Kennan, chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Committee. Kennan had just returned from an investigation in Europe.</p>
<p>The report also said that fourteen European countries, namely Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Denmark, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Poland, must receive external economic assistance in order to revive and resist the threat of communist rule. When commenting on Britain's crisis, the "Washington Post" believed that Britain must systematically reduce its military when reducing its responsibilities abroad, so that the Soviet Union's power does not suddenly increase. As for France, its pro-Soviet Communist Party is waiting for an opportunity to seize power. The French Communists believe that their opportunity has arrived after the European recovery plan fails and the United States loses its reputation in France, so Western Europe and France are now at a crossroads.</p>

They had contacted personnel in the royal palace and important figures. Unexpectedly, the plot was leaked, and Saudi Arabian King Ibn Saud learned of it and arrested them. Under torture, the woman confessed to the entire inside story of the plot.</p>
<h3>UN Agency Officially Releases Holy Land Investigation Report, Arab Ethnic Groups Firmly Oppose Partition</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] A 70,000-word report by the United Nations Palestine Inquiry Committee was recently released, revealing that, according to the suggestion of most countries, at least 416,000 "Arabs and other nationalities" will reside in the proposed Jewish state.</p>

<h3>De Gaulle's Speech Severely Criticizes the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bayonne, France, 7th] General de Gaulle said in a speech here today: The United States and the Soviet Union insist on solving the German problem against France's vital interests, putting France between two major threats. We would be greatly mistaken if we hoped for a miracle from the United States. At the same time, behind the iron whip of the Soviet regime, we find that human freedom and the independence of various countries are gradually disappearing. No one dares to predict whether the ambitions of the leaders will be limited in the future, but the serious threat to the motherland is made even more serious by a few separatist factions willing to be controlled by foreign countries, which is obvious to all.</p>

<h3>Electricity Conservation Measures Passed - Fines and Power Cuts for Exceeding Limits - To Be Implemented Next Month, Industrial Electricity Usage Not Restricted - Surcharges and Fines to Be Managed by a Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The city's electricity conservation measures have been drafted by the Public Utilities Bureau in conjunction with relevant agencies and were passed at a meeting held yesterday at the City Hall Auditorium. Implementation will begin on October 1. The electricity conservation measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For ordinary lighting and electric heating users, the standard electricity consumption is 30 kilowatt-hours per month (electricity meters under the same household name will be calculated together), with the highest electricity consumption in April, May, and June of this year as the limit. Electricity consumption within the standard will be charged at the prescribed rate. Electricity consumption above the standard but within the limit will be charged at three times the prescribed rate. For the first instance of exceeding the limit, a penalty of five times the prescribed rate will be imposed. For the second instance, a penalty of ten times the prescribed rate will be imposed. For the third instance and subsequent instances, in addition to the ten-times penalty, power cuts may be imposed depending on the severity of the circumstances. (2) For ordinary commercial lighting and electric heating users, the highest electricity consumption in April, May, and June of this year will be the limit, with 70% of the limit as the standard. (The charging and penalty methods are the same as above.) (3) For special commercial users who use one meter for lighting, power, and electric heating, the highest electricity consumption in April, May, and June of this year will be the limit, with 80% of the limit as the standard. (The charging and penalty methods are the same as above.) (4) Industrial lighting electricity will be handled in the same way as commercial users. However, large-scale industrial electricity users with a single meter for power and lighting may be exempted from restrictions. However, employee dormitories should still be handled as ordinary households.</p>
<p>Heating Electric Furnaces Are Strictly Prohibited</p>
<p>(5) All heating electric furnaces are prohibited, except for hospital operating rooms. Violators will have their power cut. (6) Once the above limits are set, they cannot be changed. If there are valid reasons, an application may be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Electricity Supply Review Committee for review and approval. (7) The surcharges and fines will be managed by a committee composed of representatives from the municipal government, the city council, the Public Utilities Bureau, and various electricity companies, convened by the Public Utilities Bureau, for the purpose of improving and increasing street lighting subsidies, offsetting losses in factory power generation, and reducing electricity prices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Director Zhao Zengjue, the strict implementation of electricity conservation measures can save up to 20,000 kilowatts of electricity for the entire city, which can be supplied for industrial use.</p>
<h3>Unresolved Ten-Year-Old Murder Case - High Court Summons Gu Zhuxuan - Denies Instigating the Assassination of Tang Jiapeng - Handwriting on Extortion Letter Difficult to Verify</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage, who was accused of instigating murder ten years ago, has been reopened. The Criminal Division of the High Court summoned Gu for questioning at 2:00 PM yesterday. On June 18, 1933, at 1:05 AM, Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World, was shot and killed at the entrance of the Great World. Tang was a protégé of Huang Jinrong. The French Concession Police arrested the perpetrators, Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui. Zhao was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Second Special District Court, and Zhang was sentenced to twenty years in prison. After serving their sentences, Zhao suddenly confessed that he was instigated by Gu Zhuxuan. On October 27, 1935, the Second Special District Court sentenced Gu to fifteen years in prison. Gu appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, and on June 26, 1936, the Third Branch of the High Court ruled that Zhao was suspected of extorting Gu, and his confession was unreliable, so he was acquitted. Subsequently, the lawyer of the French Concession Police appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that the Third Branch of the High Court's acquittal of Gu was insufficient in its investigation and remanded the case for a new trial. However, in 1937, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and the government moved westward, and the case was put on hold. After the victory, the High Court took over the puppet court and reorganized the old files, paying close attention to the case. Yesterday, the High Court opened a trial. Judge Wang Kequan took the bench and summoned Gu for questioning. Gu is currently a city councilor, a salt merchant, and 62 years old. He arrived in court yesterday wearing a gray silk gown and yellow leather shoes. When asked if he had instigated the murder, he stated that he could not remember clearly because the incident happened more than ten years ago. As for Zhao Guang's confession that he was instigated by him, he claimed that Zhao was extorting him and made false accusations out of spite, and there was a letter from Zhao demanding money as evidence. The focus of yesterday's investigation was whether the handwriting on the extortion letter was Zhao's. However, Zhao was released from the Beixinjing Prison during the Japanese occupation and was later imprisoned again for robbery, dying in prison. Zhang Tinggui left Shanghai after his release and his whereabouts are unknown. After more than ten years of turmoil, important witnesses have either died or left Shanghai, making the investigation difficult. After a brief interrogation, the court ordered him to return and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>Prosecution of General Headquarters Corruption Case - Another Anonymous Letter Received</h3>
<p>Signed "Purge Corruption Committee"</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A so-called "General Headquarters Purge Corruption Committee" sent another anonymous letter to the judicial authorities yesterday, accusing Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and others of corruption, dereliction of duty, and employing personal cronies. The letter was about a thousand words long and stated that the department had already replied to various agencies and organizations requesting the distribution of electric fans, stating that the distribution was complete. However, the department's warehouse actually had more than 400 fans in stock, and the retail department had more than 300 fans in stock, for a total of more than 700 fans. Because the prosecutor is investigating the case, Li and others are actively trying to disperse and hide the surplus fans. If the delay is too long, it may not be possible to investigate, etc. The letter ended with a seal of "General Headquarters Purge Corruption Committee" but no name of the anonymous accuser.</p>
<h3>Special Business Tax - Cannot Be Postponed - Request to Allocate Funds to Municipal Treasury Difficult to Approve</h3>
<p>Regarding the special business tax in this city, the municipal government previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to postpone the collection until July of this year and planned to allocate 70% of the tax revenue to the municipal treasury. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has received an instruction from the Executive Yuan stating that the special business tax should be collected from May 1 of this year. As it is a national matter, the Shanghai municipal government's request for postponement cannot be approved. As for the request to allocate 70% of the actual tax revenue to the municipal treasury, it is inconsistent with the original intent of the revised financial revenue and expenditure system law and cannot be approved. The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau is instructed to handle the collection of taxes according to the law.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau is actively carrying out the declaration work for the special business tax in this city. It is reported that various units under the jurisdiction of the bureau that are liable to pay the tax have begun to make declarations.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Kuomintang - Inauguration Ceremony Held Yesterday - Central Government Sends President Yu to Supervise Oath - Suggests Building a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The newly appointed executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, as well as the executive and supervisory committee members of the district party headquarters and directly affiliated branches, held a joint oath-taking ceremony at the Great Light Theater at 9:00 AM yesterday. Yu Youren, a standing committee member of the Central Committee and President of the Control Yuan, was specially dispatched by the Central Committee to supervise the oath. Guests included Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, and others, as well as newly appointed executive and supervisory committee members Wu Kaixian, Wang Xinheng, Xie Renzhao, Chen Baotai, Zhang Xiaosong, Xu Mingya, Chen Baohua, Ge Kexin, Chen Yide, and others, and more than a thousand party member representatives who attended the ceremony. At the beginning of the ceremony, Chairman Fang Zhi led all the supervisory committee members to raise their hands and take the oath. President Yu delivered a speech, recalling that the Kuomintang had overcome all kinds of difficulties in the past fifty years. It is now facing a period of transformation, and all party members should redouble their efforts to realize Sun Yat-sen's principles, complete the mission of national construction, and promote the realization of a new China. Yu then spoke in detail about the revolutionary history of Shanghai and suggested that Shanghai should build a "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall" to connect the permanent admiration of the people. Subsequently, Mayor Wu and Wang Xiaolai delivered speeches successively. Mayor Wu encouraged all party members with three points: soundness, initiative, and cooperation. Regarding President Yu's suggestion to build a "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall," he stated that the Racecourse was an ideal location and that he was currently discussing it with relevant parties. In principle, both parties have agreed to exchange it for land in the suburbs. The details on the quantity and procedures are still under discussion, but he hopes that the "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall" can be completed by this time next year. Finally, Chairman Fang delivered a speech on behalf of the representatives, briefly stating: "The number of party members in this city is already considerable, but we cannot be complacent about this. We must also have a sound organization and effective work, and play a grassroots role in society, so that we can live up to the expectations of our superiors and be worthy of being members of the Chinese Kuomintang," and so on.</p>

<h3>Military Tribunal Tried Two Japanese War Criminals Yesterday - Trial of Takeda Concluded, Trial of Asano Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense held a public trial of Japanese war criminals Takeda Matsuji and Asano Takashi. Takeda still denied the illegal detention and beating of our good citizen Song Jizhao in Qingdao. After the prosecutor refuted him one by one, he finally bowed his head and remained silent. The presiding judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 15th. Asano was then questioned. The criminal repeatedly prevaricated regarding the continuous framing of our underground comrades Wang Shouneng, Dai Qingfang, and more than 20 others.

The case was heard in the criminal court of the district court yesterday. According to She's statement: because there were too many workers at the time, there was a lot of shouting. In the chaos, my pistol was snatched away. As for how Liu Jilin and Li Zhen were shot and killed, I don't know. The three defendants, Qian Wang, denied hitting anyone. Witness Cai Zhichun said that he heard gunshots, but he didn't know who fired them. The court ordered She to be remanded in custody, and the other three defendants were released on bail.</p>
<h3>A Piece of Identification - Points to Kerry as the Murderer - Defense Attorney Asks for Malley to Be Found Not Guilty - Judge Announces in Court That He Will Not Accept It</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The U.S. military court opened at 9:00 AM yesterday to continue hearing the Yu Shengxiao case. First, the prosecutor read aloud Malley's defense statement written on the 11th of last month, which stated that he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of August 1st. At noon, he met Kerry at the New Lizz Bar. Kerry asked him to assist with a transaction, claiming that the house at 571 Hongqiao Road was jointly owned by him and a certain U.S. Major. Now he wanted Malley to impersonate the Major and sell the house. He agreed at the time. Then, Kerry hired a car, and Malley, wearing plain clothes and a felt hat, got into the car with Kerry. At about 5:00 PM in the afternoon, they picked up a Chinese man at the Bund, who was later identified as Yu Shengxiao. There was no conversation in the car at the time. When the car drove to Hongqiao Road, Kerry first obtained gold bars from Yu Shengxiao and then shot him. Yu Shengxiao and I were sitting in the back seat, so my pants were stained with blood. After killing Yu Shengxiao, Kerry stopped the car, kicked Yu Shengxiao to the side of the road, and took me to his house, washed off the bloodstains, handed me the murder weapon, and told me to keep it a secret, saying that there would be a reward. The next day, when I saw Kerry, he said that the gold bars could not be sold for the time being, so he gave me $150 first. I did not see him again until I was arrested. The court then continued to examine the witnesses, first summoning two sergeants from the U.S. Criminal Investigation Department, who confirmed that Malley had been interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department and that his confession had been transferred to the military advisory group.</p>
<p>Kerry's Wife Faints Upon Leaving the Court</p>
<p>The court then questioned Kerry's wife in detail for more than an hour. She stated that Kerry returned home with Malley on August 1st, after 7:00 PM. Because it was late, she did not see their clothes clearly. After the two returned home, Malley immediately went to the bathroom to take a shower, and Kerry followed him, which lasted about 50 minutes. At this point in the testimony, the judge asked about the situation of the two in the bathroom. Kerry's wife became angry and said, "This is a stupid question." She then continued to testify: there was nothing unusual in the bathroom. She and Kerry went out to see a play at 9:00 PM that evening and returned home at 11:00 PM. The next day, Malley came to visit. She knew nothing about the conversation between her husband and Malley because she was not there. When the defense attorney asked if her testimony was truthful, Kerry's wife burst into tears. When she left the court, she fainted, causing a commotion in the court.</p>
<p>Sergeant in the Same Room Proves There Was a Gun</p>
<p>After Kerry's wife left the court, the two sergeants who shared a room with Malley were summoned, both of whom testified that Malley did indeed have a gun on weekdays. Then Kerry was asked again, and he firmly stated: Malley's statement that he was responsible for all the expenses of coming to Shanghai was completely untrue. At the same time, when he went to Hongqiao Road on August 1st, it was entirely Malley's intention that he act as the driver. At this point in the interrogation, it was past noon, so an adjournment was announced. The court continued to open at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. The defendant's defense attorney, Bollekin, in accordance with Anglo-American legal procedures, made a motion asking the court to declare Malley not guilty. Bollekin had unimpeded eloquence and skilled techniques, saying that he had more than twenty reasons to prove that Malley was not the murderer. He then listed the main points, explained them, and said that based on Malley's situation, it was inappropriate for the military court to directly call him a murderer. The judge and prosecutor both disagreed, and the latter cited case precedents to express their inability to accept the defendant's defense attorney's motion. However, Bollekin still found reasons to support his position. Finally, presiding judge Colonel Palmer announced: the court does not accept the defendant's defense attorney's motion.</p>
<p>The Defendant's Side Presents Rebuttal Evidence</p>
<p>After a five-minute recess, Malley's defense attorney presented rebuttal evidence. The first witness was He Dengkui, a member of the Qingpu Self-Defense Force. He was one of the first people to discover Yu Shengxiao. He said that Yu Shengxiao only said at the time that he was shot by a foreigner. When asked who, he said Kerry and did not mention an American. The second witness was a Jewish American employee, Luo Qi, who had previously been deceived by Kerry's bad checks, saying that Kerry was a person with a bad reputation. The third witness was Tao Genrong, the chief of the foreign affairs section of the police station, who briefly described the previous investigation. The fourth witness was Major McLane, the director of the U.S. military hospital at the Broadway Building. He said that Malley's daily work was satisfactory and that his behavior at work was also good. He also said that Malley reported to him at about 3:30 PM on August 1st, but it was difficult to prove whether he had indeed arrived in Shanghai on that day. At this point, the presiding judge ordered an adjournment and rescheduled the trial to begin at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>

<h3>Hoping to Achieve Safe Roads in Shanghai Traffic - Traffic Safety Awareness Week Begins Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Today is the first day of this year's Traffic Safety Awareness Week in this city. In order to raise public awareness, the municipal government, in addition to having the police bureau increase the number of patrol teams to go to various major intersections to effectively patrol and direct traffic, the Public Utilities Bureau also produced 15 kinds of prominent slogans and posted them in various important locations and on vehicles. At the same time, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, Director Yu, and Director Zhao will all conduct special broadcasts. From today, all six-wheeled trucks (excluding buses) are prohibited from driving on Nanjing East Road. The Public Utilities Bureau has installed wooden signs with the words "Trucks and Vehicles with Six Wheels or More Are Prohibited" at the Bund and New World on Nanjing Road to promote drivers to obey. The relevant bureaus of the municipal government held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the publicity matters during this week in detail to ensure smooth progress.</p>
<p>Total Number of Vehicles is 260,000</p>
<p>According to a recent survey report by the Public Utilities Bureau, as of the beginning of July of this year, the motorized vehicles in this city included 8,876 private cars, 1,005 commercial cars, 3,464 private trucks, 2,889 commercial trucks, 2,841 motorcycles, 208 test cars, 20 test motorcycles, 1,328 jeeps, 2,073 military cars, 1,948 military trucks, and 105 military motorcycles, for a total of 24,757 vehicles. The non-motorized vehicles included 163,507 bicycles, 720 small carts, 7,930 two-wheeled bicycles, 17 private horse-drawn carriages, 63 commercial horse-drawn carriages, 15 horse-drawn freight carts, 10,985 pneumatic-tire freight carts, 14,697 iron-wheeled freight carts, 6,222 private rickshaws, 5,250 private three-wheeled rickshaws, 14,372 commercial rickshaws, 9,715 commercial tricycles, 2,191 garbage carts, and 6,171 single-seat tricycles, for a total of 241,855 vehicles. The total number of vehicles is 266,612.</p>
<p>Extensive Publicity to Reduce Accidents</p>
<p>There are so many vehicles in this city, the population has increased to nearly 5 million, but road construction has not progressed, and the width is uneven, causing traffic accidents to occur daily. From September 9th of last year, the municipal government designated the area south of Suzhou Road, north of Zhongzheng East Road, east of Xizang Road, and west of Zhongshan East Road as the central district and promulgated the "Measures to Improve Traffic in the Central District." Strict management was carried out on traffic, parking, and bridge traffic in accordance with the measures. The results have been good over the past year. However, because this management system has not yet been popularized throughout the city, traffic accidents in this city have not gradually decreased. According to police statistics: there were 183 cases in January, 209 cases in February, 197 cases in March, 209 cases in April, 224 cases in May, 207 cases in June, and 183 cases in July.</p>
<p>The "Measures to Improve Traffic in the Central District" have been implemented for one year, but many drivers and pedestrians still ignore traffic management rules, either crossing red lights or disobeying commands. At best, this affects personal safety, and at worst, it causes confusion in the entire traffic situation, which the municipal government deeply regrets. Therefore, extensive publicity will be carried out this week to thoroughly improve the situation. Mayor Wu stated yesterday that he hopes that public security in this city can achieve "doors not locked at night," and traffic can achieve "no accidents on the roads."</p>

<h3>Restaurants Express Concerns Over the Ban on Shark Fin and Sea Cucumber</h3>
<p>Proposal to Increase the Starting Point for Banquet Tax Collection</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The consumption streamlining measures also include restrictions on banquets. Yesterday, responsible personnel from the restaurant industry stated that restaurants have large stocks of shark fin and sea cucumber, and a ban would have a significant impact. Furthermore, the current starting point for banquet tax collection in this city is 10,000 yuan. In reality, due to rising prices, most dishes now cost at least around 10,000 yuan, placing a heavy burden on the restaurant industry. Therefore, it is proposed to submit a document to the Municipal Council, requesting an increase in the starting point based on the rice price in January of this year and the 5,000-yuan starting point, compared to the current rice price.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper's Souvenirs Distributed Starting Yesterday</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Austrian youth Li Huimin, 33 years old, lives at No. 1, Lane 162, Jinxian Road. He is currently a bookkeeper at the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall at No. 2, Lane 70, Nanjing West Road. He had already married a wife in his hometown, but did not bring her to Shanghai. Living alone, he felt lonely. A friend, Cheng Qinming, introduced him to his cousin Chen Huilian (22 years old, from Guangdong, residing at No. 20, Lane 357, Weihaiwei Road) before May. The two fell in love at first sight, shared common interests, and often went out together. A month ago, Li asked Chen to get engaged, hoping to spend their lives together. However, Huiyun already knew that he had a wife, so she refused his request.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 5th, at around 4 p.m., Li went to Chen's house to invite Huilian out, accompanied her to Li's house, treated her attentively, and chatted happily. At around 7:20 p.m., Li asked for intimate relations, but Chen婉拒ed him. Li then closed the door, forcefully attempted indecent assault. Chen resisted with all her might. Finally, Li took out a fake pistol from the drawer to intimidate her. Knowing that she could not escape, Chen, filled with shame and indignation, took advantage of an opportunity to jump out of the window of the pavilion room on the third floor, injuring her head. Upon seeing this, Li hurriedly went downstairs to rescue her and was about to call a Tailai taxi to send her to the Sino-American Hospital. However, the neighbors had already reported to the Lujiawan Police Precinct, which dispatched Inspector Qin Boliang and police officers to the scene, who arrested Li. They then transferred the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries were serious. After investigation, he was charged with attempted rape, disrupting public morals, and endangering public safety, and the fake pistol was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Merchants Couldn't Pick Up Their Goods, Shipping Company Sued</h3>
<p>Yesterday, nine customers of Guomin Navigation and Aviation Company, including Lu Binru and Wang Junming, claimed to the Xincheng Branch Bureau that they had been embezzled by the company of goods worth billions of yuan. The chairman of the company is Wang Guanying, a senator from Jiangxi Province, and the manager is Wang Naiguang. On July 3rd of this year, Lu and others in Sichuan and Yichang entrusted the company to transport a large number of food rice, coal, pickled vegetables, etc., totaling more than 200 tons, on the Guoguang raw iron barge towed by the company's Jiangnan steamer. On August 18, the steamer arrived in Shanghai. The Sichuan merchants who arrived in Shanghai went to the Dada Wharf to pick up their goods the next day, but the Finance Ministry had been notified that the company’s ships have been impounded due to unpaid rent. Lu and others then asked Wang Naiguang to compensate them and reported to the bureau. Because the incident did not fall within the jurisdiction of the bureau, the branch bureau sent personnel to transfer the manager Zhu Naiguang and the nine plaintiffs to the Water Police Branch Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3>The Whole of Shandong's Industrial and Mining Center, The Boshan Mining Area Survey, Ensuring the Safety of Each Mine, Assisting the Resumption of Work in Private Factories</h3>
<p>[Jinan, 4th, Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Zibo is the industrial and mining center of Shandong, covering coal, glass, ceramics, aluminum, iron, lead, silver, gold, and more. Of these, the first three have already been successfully exploited. Aluminum production also began under Japanese operation during the late stages of the Anti-Japanese War, and it was praised as the first light metal factory in East Asia, the reserves of which are not known. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the area has fallen into the hands of bandits three times. On August 17, the national army was restored for the third time. In order to understand the actual situation in the area, on the 28th of last month, the reporter and the news office of the Sui District Fan, Director Qijun went to inspect, passed through Licheng, Longshan, Mingshui, Wangcun, and arrived in Boshan on the evening of the 29th. On the 30th and 31st, they visited various factories and mines in Boshan after the robbery. On the 1st, they left Boshan and went to Xihe to visit the Yuesheng Coal Mine. In the afternoon, they went to Gouchuan to visit the Luda Coal Mine. On the 2nd, they left Zibo and went to Nanding to visit the light metal factory. That night, they passed through Zhangdian to Zhoucun. They returned to Jinan on the evening of the 3rd. On the way, they overturned once and were ambushed by local bandits twice, experiencing many hardships and narrowly escaping danger. The various situations are divided into sections for the readers of this newspaper.</p>
<p>According to experts, the total coal reserves in the Zibo area are estimated to be over 2 billion tons, which are divided into three types: (1) state-owned, (2) provincial-owned, and (3) privately owned. Among them, the state-owned Luda and Yuesheng mines are the largest in scale. It is estimated that the reserves of these two mines alone reach 1.3 billion tons, accounting for almost two-thirds of the total reserves in the area.</p>
<p>The Luda Mine is located in Hongshan, 3 kilometers southeast of the Zichuan Station on the Zhangbo branch line. In the 25th year of Guangxu (1899), after the Germans seized Jiaozhou Bay under the pretext of the Caozhou religious case, they began to build the Jiaoji Railway and the Zhangbo branch line. In the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), they founded the Zichuan Coal Mine, which was completely occupied by the Japanese in the third year of the Republic of China (1914) when the First World War broke out. After the Washington Conference, the company was formally reorganized into a joint Sino-Japanese venture. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923), the Luda Company was formally established. In fact, the power was entirely in the hands of the Japanese until the victory. The Yuesheng Coal Mine was originally a privately-run business, with coal mines in Xihe, Taohuayu, and Dakui Mountain. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the Japanese forced it to cooperate. After the Japanese surrendered, the two mines were occupied by the communists on August 23 of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945). After the government negotiated with Japan, the Japanese army took them back on September 14, and the national army accepted the surrender and took over. However, the mines were occupied by the communists for the second time on January 13 of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946). After the national army recovered them on July 11 of the same year, the Shandong Pacification District United Command, in order to adapt to the environment, organized an industrial and mining management committee to manage all the coal mines in the Zibo area. The two mines were also included. On November 11 of the same year, the Zibo Coal Mine Management Office of the Resources Committee formally took over. As for the Yuesheng Mine, because it was originally a private enterprise, all property rights and debts are currently being investigated by the court. Before the court formally makes a ruling, the company still recognizes its production machine.</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, the total coal production in the Zibo area was about 200,000 tons per month, of which the Luyue mines accounted for 100,000 tons, accounting for half of the total production in the area. The output was very small in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. From the 29th to the 34th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese were keen to operate, and the average monthly output reached 300,000 tons, of which the Luyue mines reached 180,000 tons, accounting for about 60% of the total output in the area. When the communists occupied the area last year, the demand for coal was not great, and the original coal reserves were sufficient for the communists, so the output was very small. After the Zibo Coal Mine Company took over, it actively reorganized and strived to increase production. Before the national army withdrew on February 23 of this year, the output of the two mines had reached 45,000 tons per month. On August 17, Zibo was restored for the third time. On the 27th, the receiving personnel arrived one after another. After detailed inspection, Yuesheng had no major losses and could resume work immediately. Although the ground transportation equipment of Luda, such as the tram lines and high-voltage lines, was damaged, and the equipment warehouse and carpentry factory were burned down, and most of the parts of the main engine of the repair factory were removed, the power equipment was fortunately intact. Mr. Ke Lisha, a coal industry expert from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, inspected the area and promised to retain the necessary machinery and materials. It has now followed the instructions of the Resources Committee to receive, sort out, and store the machines, and then submit a plan to the Executive Yuan for appropriation of funds. Boshan No. 1 Mine, which is owned by the province, was established in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946) and was formed by the merger of the Bodha, Fudha and Leadha mines. Except for Leadha, which was destroyed by the bandits and cannot be mined, the monthly output reached 8,000 tons before the withdrawal on February 23 this year. When the communists withdrew this time, in addition to looting all the equipment parts, the mining machinery was mostly intact. After repairs and drying the water in the pit, it officially started to resume work on September 1, with a daily output of 200 tons of raw coal.</p>
<p>There are 23 private factories and mines in the Zibo area. Except for two mines, such as Huadong, which were maintained by workers during the communist occupation to maintain the livelihood of the workers and continue to produce coal and are still being mined, most of the other mines are preparing to resume work due to excessive water accumulation in the mines.</p>
<p>According to the Zibo area, the total coal reserves are so deep, and the output is as high as the military. If there are no special changes, it will not be difficult to gradually increase the monthly output to 300,000 tons (the original Japanese plan was to increase production to 8 million tons in the 36th year of the Republic of China.). In terms of quality, the ash content is only 12%, which is slightly inferior to the Zaozhuang coal mine, but far better than the Kailuan coal mine. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese army used this coal exclusively for steelmaking in the Kyushu Steel Plant and other steelmaking plants. If the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji railways are restored, in addition to the Jinan and Qingdao areas, the coal shortage in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin can also be solved. According to the opinions provided by relevant parties, the current difficulties are:</p>
<p>(1) Transportation: The western section of Jiaoji is currently only 45 li between Jinan and Guodian can be open to traffic. The railways between Guodian and Zhangdian have all been destroyed. The original rails of the Zhangdian Boshan branch line have also been rebuilt by the communists into light railways with a width of one meter. Although the branch railway is now complete, the four locomotives that were used to open traffic during the communist period have all been destroyed. After several repairs, only one has been completed. The lack of locomotives makes it difficult to operate the trains. As for the railway materials on the Jiaoji main line, in order to complete the Xuji section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway as soon as possible, the materials for the western section of Jiaoji have not been settled so far. In particular, sleepers are in short supply. It is estimated that it can only be extended to Mingshui at most. If only coal is transported by road, the amount of transportation is small and the cost is high. Although the current price of raw coal in Zibo is only 250,000 yuan per ton (the current coal reserves in the Zibo Golden Zone are about 60,000 to 80,000 tons), but if it is transported to Jinan by car, it costs 1.2 million per ton, which is too expensive to solve the current coal shortage in Jinan. Therefore, it is generally hoped that it can be extended to Wangcun at least, and only 25 kilometers between Wangcun and Zichuan are used by cars. Only such a transportation plan can barely match the production plan.</p>
<p>(2) Expedite industrial and mining loans so that various private factories and mines can be mined as soon as possible. The state-owned Luda should also make official resumption plans in the spirit of surprise operations, so that the original 35,000 workers and 48,000 workers in Boshan (the total number of coal workers in Boshan) can all be able to settle down as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Before withdrawing, the communists everywhere declared that the reason why the equipment of the workshop was not destroyed this time was in preparation for returning within two months to make a "fourth liberation." In order to avoid people from suffering and the local area being devastated again, before the local armed forces in various counties are fully rebuilt and strengthened, the government should send regular troops to ensure the safety of each mine and expand the recovered area, from point-line occupation to the control of the surface.

<h3>Wuhu Approved to Establish a City, City Government to Be Established Within Three Months, Jingwu Section Road Workers Active</h3>
<p>[Wuhu, 8th, Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The establishment of Wuhu as a city has been approved by the Ministry of Interior. The Anhui Provincial Government plans to establish the municipal government within three months after the Wuhu Municipal Preparatory Office handles tasks such as delimitation and verification of the population. The original county government will move to Fangcun Town, and the Sixth District Commissioner's Office will move to Xuancheng. This plan is being submitted for approval. The 100-kilometer repair project on the Jingwu section of the Jiangnan Railway has been active because 130,000 sleepers and 13 military aircraft have been delayed at the Zhonghua Gate Station in Nanjing. As for what is lacking, the rail side has already negotiated to borrow 8 million US dollars to purchase from the United States. As soon as the rails arrive, the road can be opened to traffic in 40 days. In the midst of the rampant bandits north and south of the Yangtze River, the early restoration of this road will really help the people's livelihood and military defense.</p>
<h3>Xikang Promotes Government Affairs, Supervisory Commissioner's Office to Be Established</h3>
<p>[Ya'an, 8th, Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The area outside the Xikang Pass is vast, and the folk customs are special, making it difficult to manage. In order to facilitate the supervision of government affairs, the provincial authorities have specially requested the Executive Yuan to set up two administrative supervisory commissioner's offices in Litang in Kangnan District and Ganzi in Kangbei District. The request has been formally approved. Fan Changzeng and Yan Shu will serve as commissioners, and the offices can be formally established. In addition, there have been many recent changes in county magistrates: Liu Wenqi will serve as the magistrate of Zhanhua County, He Boxun will serve as the magistrate of Daocheng County, Zai Zhengguan will serve as the magistrate of Yueji County, and Zhou Yingkui will serve as the magistrate of Yanyuan County.</p>

<h3>Bandit Looting in Liuan, Cigarettes, Shoes and Socks Searched All</h3>
<p>[Hefei, 6th, Dispatch from Our Newspaper] A refugee from Liuan said: The Communist Liu Bocheng troops who fell into Liucheng this time were parts of the Third and Sixth Columns, about 3,000 people. They first released the prisoners in the old Yamen Taizi Prison, and then began to search for cigarettes, pastries, shoe stores, sock shops, paints, and sewing machines, losing almost everything. In the four villages of Liuan, there were small disturbances, and the order was extremely chaotic. On the afternoon of the 4th, our national army Tan division had arrived in the eastern suburbs of Liucheng, and another national army had also reached the west bank of Chuhe, and began to attack fiercely. A large army gathered in Hefei and continued to drive to Liuan to cooperate in the suppression, and the people's hearts were as peaceful as usual.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Zeal, Sending Sons to Camp, Liu Zhongchen from Southern Henan Honored with Praise</h3>
<p>[Kaifeng, 3rd, Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Henan Military Region Command has recently received a telegram from the Southern Henan Military Region, stating that Liu Zhongchen, a citizen of Jiamin of Yijia, Shiqibaocheng, Fuxing Town, Xixian County, said: "My wife died early, and I have two sons. The eldest son is ill and cannot be drafted, but the second son is healthy and is a young man of age. Now, with the war clouds densely covered and the communist bandits rebelling, it is urgent to consolidate national defense and suppress the communist bandits. Now, I am willing to personally send my second son, Liu Jingong, to the Eighth Battalion to perform military service, and I implore you to approve the inspection and acceptance." It is reported that the Henan Military Region, after hearing the report, believed that Liu Zhongchen deeply understood righteousness, and his patriotism was the only one seen in this year's conscription. In addition to first issuing an order to praise him and informing the subordinates to know, it was also reported to the Ministry of National Defense for commendation.</p>
<h3>Nearly 300,000 Illiterates in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] The statistics on the occupation of the population of Guangzhou have been published. Among the citizens, there are a total of 293,309 people who do not recognize the characters.</p>
<h3>Fujian-Jiangxi National Highway Fully Repaired</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th] The Fujian-Jiangxi National Highway has been taken over by the Fuzhou Engineering Office of the Third District Bureau of the Highway Administration. The entire line is divided into four general sections, and each general section is divided into three subsections. Now, the entire line has begun to be repaired and is preparing for improvement projects. The central government previously approved an appropriation of 9 billion for improvement projects. Due to rising prices, it has been requested to add more, and it is expected to complete part of the project within the year.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices in Beiping: Civilian Life Still Comfortable; Diplomatic and Military Circles View It as a Paradise</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 8th] Although prices in Beiping are lower than in Shanghai, they have risen sharply in recent weeks. Tram and public bus fares have almost doubled, electricity has increased by about 25%, and coal prices have increased by 50%. Major hotels have raised prices by 30% since September 1, greatly affecting travelers. In the past two months, a 12% education surcharge has been added, and will continue to be levied. According to merchants, Beiping was formerly a transit center for goods such as furs, exported from Tianjin, and commerce was quite prosperous, but it is now extremely desolate. Although people acknowledge that rising prices are unavoidable due to the internal turmoil, the soaring price of coal is particularly concerning, given Beiping's severe winter cold.</p>
<p>Coal Price Increases; Electricity Conservation</p>
<p>The Mentougou coal mine was partially flooded by heavy rain recently, which is one of the reasons for the increase in coal prices. It is expected that prices will continue to rise after winter. Transportation difficulties also affect the supply of coal, and there is little hope for improvement at present. To conserve electricity, power is cut off in different areas every night, ranging from twenty minutes to several hours, depending on the location.</p>
<p>Rent Calculated in Flour; No Tips Taken</p>
<p>Some landlords, to avoid being penalized for using foreign currency, do not calculate rent in foreign currency but according to the market price of flour, such as monthly rent being equivalent to twelve bags of flour. One advantage here is that no tips are demanded for rent, but some landlords are imitating Shanghai people and require advance payment of five or six months' rent. Entertainment venues close at midnight, and a curfew starts from 1:00 AM, requiring special passes for travel, but most people go to bed before 1:00 AM, so it is not much of an inconvenience. People in diplomatic and military circles are happy to live in Beiping and consider being transferred elsewhere as unfortunate.</p>
<p>Abundant Food Supply; Inexpensive and Fine Wine</p>
<p>The food supply here is abundant, with a wide variety, and rationing is not implemented. Wine is particularly inexpensive and of good quality. Before Beiping was designated as the capital, ambassadors and ministers from various countries resided in the Dongjiaomin Lane, a world apart. Now, among the major powers, some countries that originally had ambassadors stationed in Beiping have not even established a consulate. Dongjiaomin Lane has been returned to Chinese administration, and former embassies are either left vacant or only partially occupied, while the former Japanese and German embassies have been taken over by China.</p>
<p>Few Foreigners; Soviet Nationals Evacuate</p>
<p>The number of foreigners in Beiping was originally not large, and the number has further decreased due to the evacuation of Soviet nationals. Although commerce in Beiping is languishing, and prices may continue to rise, even those who are not very affluent still live comfortably. Those who have traveled here from countries with insufficient food, a lack of housing, and no servants to hire will especially view it as a paradise.</p>
<h3>Thirteenth Meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government; Decision to Establish Field Grain Offices in Four Counties</h3>

<p>[Another Report] According to refugees fleeing from northern Jiangsu, after the military failure of the communists in Shandong Province, they knew that their demise was near, so they launched a "Sweep Away the Ashes Movement," and the communists carried out massacres. In the area of southern Shandong bordering Qingkou in the Ganzhou area, more than 4,000 men and women were abducted, more than 800 were killed, more than ten were raped to death, and they extorted money and guns as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Singaporean Representative Reports on Church Conference; Overseas Chinese in Singapore are Accused of Learning Chinese; Wu Yifang Claims There is Only One Type of Chinese Language and Overseas Chinese Do Not Refuse to Learn It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th] The Far East Christian Education Conference held its fourth general meeting at 10:30 AM on the 8th. Chairman Hang Liwu announced the itinerary of the Chinese government's invitation to all representatives to visit Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beiping, and Chongqing. Secretary-General Guo Youshou reported that the United Nations Education Delegation would host a cocktail party at 5:30 PM on the 8th. Then Hang asked Vice Chairman Guo, representing Saidi Ding, to chair the meeting on his behalf, and began the regional representatives' reports on the situation of Christian Education. Sarawak's representative Dickson reported that the region has approximately 6 million people. Aside from the British education system, the education of overseas Chinese and locals is very rudimentary and needs to be developed. Thailand's representative Seguan reported that Thailand began enforcing Christian education in 1921, using Thai as the language of instruction. Since 1935, children aged 15 and under have been required to receive four years of education.</p>
<p>Thailand now has 430 national schools with 61,000 students; 11,000 county and municipal schools with 1.5 million students; 1,600 private schools, with approximately 2.2 million school-age children enrolled and over 200,000 not enrolled; approximately 7 million illiterate adults (adult education has been started since 1940). After Seguan finished reporting, our representative Qu Junong and Burma's representative Yu Baluan raised questions about selling goods. Singapore's representative Nelson reported that Singapore has a population of one million, with overseas Chinese accounting for 70%, Indian and Malay each accounting for 10%. The current number of students in schools is approximately 40,000 in Chinese schools, approximately 5,000 in Malay schools, approximately 4,000 in Indian schools, and approximately 20,000 in English schools. In primary education, the first three years are spent learning the native languages of each ethnic group, followed by English. The Singapore government currently has an education budget of 3.5 million Singapore dollars, which will increase to 13.5 million after the ten-year education plan is implemented. After Nelson finished speaking, Burma's representative Yu Balu proposed that the language of instruction in Christian education should be primarily the native languages of each ethnic group, and English schools should also teach these languages. Nelson said that some overseas Chinese in Singapore are unwilling to learn the Chinese language, to which our representative Wu Yifang responded that some overseas Chinese are accustomed to using dialects and find it difficult to learn the national language. Chinese is only one type, and their learning of English in Singapore is necessary for commercial convenience, and does not mean that they are unwilling to learn Chinese. Burma's representative Zi Que also said that based on experience, teaching English from the beginning of middle school is more effective than starting in elementary school. Wang Zongjing, representing the Malay Federation, also gave an example, saying that Malay Christian education combines various ethnic groups in one school, with separate classes, collective games, which greatly enhances language learning and national sentiments. Finally, Hong Kong's representative Mao Gen reported that the Hong Kong government has not paid attention to elementary schools, with approximately 100,000 students, 80,000 of whom are educated in private schools, and the education system is the same as in China. After Mao finished reporting, the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>

The first group was the General Administration Group, chaired by Nepal's representative Yu Shanhe, attended by Guo Youshou, Luo Ruisi, Ai Jilan (all from United Nations Educational), Yu Que (Burma), Jia (India), Seguan (Thailand), Nelson (Singapore), and Wu Yifang, Zhu Jingnong, Zha Liangzhao, Ou Yuanhuai and other ten people, discussed in detail how to integrate the Christian education system and administration with the social life of the educated.

<h3>Memories of the Sports Festival</h3>
<p>— Wu Bangwei</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, it was felt that the low physical fitness of the people was affecting military and production, and calls were made to promote sports and improve national health. In order to discuss how to realize this demand, the Ministry of Education, with the approval of the government, convened the National Sports Conference on October 10th of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940], and passed many measures. In particular, it was felt that there was a need for a perfect law that would clearly define responsibilities and indicate guidelines to serve as a basis for implementation. Therefore, a proposal to amend the National Sports Law was submitted and passed. The Ministry of Education, based on this resolution, invited relevant agencies and experts to make a final revision in the wording, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for amendment and approval, and then forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. After three readings, it was submitted to the National Government for approval. This amended National Sports Law was promulgated in September of the 30th year of the Republic [i.e. 1941].</p>
<p>After the amendment and promulgation of the National Sports Law, the Ministry of Education assumed responsibility for national sports administration. In addition to implementing various resolutions of the National Sports Conference to the extent possible, it was believed that national sports was a comprehensive social activity that required a fixed program to promote public attention. Therefore, it was also based on: (1) the National Sports Law was promulgated on September 9th; (2) September 9th is the Double Ninth Festival, which coincides with the meaning of sports; with these two points in mind, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan to designate September 9th as Sports Festival, which was subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan. The first Sports Festival was born on September 9th of the 31st year of the Republic [i.e. 1942], and the Ministry of Education stipulated the methods for holding it, and the Ministry of Social Affairs jointly ordered the local governments to comply and implement. Since then, the two ministries have jointly issued notices before each year to remind the local governments, so that the Sports Festival can gradually become a meaningful festival, thereby influencing the promotion and development of national sports. Thus, this year's Sports Festival should be the sixth.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the sixth Sports Festival, I cannot help but feel something. First, the National Sports Law has been promulgated for seven years, but it seems that it has not been respected or paid attention to. Therefore, all sports undertakings have shown no progress or prospects. Second, thinking of the old saying that laws alone cannot be implemented, all sports professionals should redouble their efforts, be faithful to their duties, and further promote the effective implementation of the National Sports Law with the power of unity. The international situation is unpredictable, and we must not wait until the next time we are invaded to feel the poor physical fitness of the people and repeat the history of the past.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the September 9th Sports Festival</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhijiang</p>
<p>Strengthening the country and teaching war are the top priorities of nation-building. Defending against insults and self-defense are urgent tasks. Strengthening the body and race, enriching the quality, promoting martial arts, and laying the foundation for national defense are essential. The Six Arts education, with equal emphasis on archery and chariot driving, cultivates cultured and virtuous individuals with superior wisdom. The supreme sage and philosopher promoted strength and perseverance, practicing diligently upon hearing the rooster crow. Let us carry forward our martial prowess and emulate the vigor of heaven. Pure and steadfast, we are capable of accomplishing great things. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings are comprehensive, emphasizing that self-defense is the most important thing in life, and that personal and national defense are inherently linked. Airplanes and artillery are certainly powerful weapons, but the effectiveness of martial arts is comparable. Specializing in combat, close-quarters combat, and night raids is crucial. In the atomic age, with the rapid progress of science and technology, invention and creation depend first on energy. After the completion of the Northern Expedition, the capital was established in Nanjing. Progressive leaders of the Party and state shared similar views. We established museums and schools to train teachers, expand teaching, and connect Chinese and Western cultures. The President advocated and exhorted us earnestly, ordering us to exercise and unite the country. National martial arts techniques, principles, and equipment are all complete and comprehensive, surpassing any gymnastics. He specifically instructed armed groups to include them as regular courses without hesitation. In 1936, at the Olympic Games, we participated but did not aim for the top. The honor we received depended solely on the national essence. Foreigners commented on its preciousness, artistic excellence, and deep interest. The struggle was solemn, the valor martial and elite, the dance dazzling, and the transformations progressive and regressive. These three major characteristics make it an unparalleled art. As a member of the first National Political Council, I also suggested that it is necessary to promote the spirit of martial arts. The reasons and methods are sufficient and specific, and training centers should be established in all provinces, counties, and cities. The highest national defense committee passed the entire plan, ordering its implementation. The teaching order was formulated to be uniform across the country, and all levels of schools should teach it. The experience of the War of Resistance proved that recruits were of surprisingly diverse physical fitness. The standards set by the Ministry were lowered three times. The selection results showed that only 20% of them met the requirements. The selection of air force pilots was even more difficult, with only 2% being selected on average. The recruitment process continues to be lengthy. Sound physique is a prerequisite. In summary, the above is related to survival. Promoting and promoting it must be active. Self-strengthening and race-strengthening are the foundations of revitalization, and self-defense and defense of the country are important for survival. Everyone fighting for themselves is what the times require, and the mobilization of all people is an unavoidable duty.

<h3>Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, Officially Takes Office, Aiming to Eliminate the Foreign Exchange Black Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, officially took office yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM. At around 11:00 AM, Mr. Chen, accompanied by committee members Xu Boyue and Shen Xirui, met with the local press at the Central Bank's conference room, and immediately released his inaugural address, which is as follows:</p>
<p>China is currently at an extremely difficult time. In order to seek self-reliance and preserve national resources, the government must impose strict control over foreign exchange. China's lack of foreign exchange is similar to the situation in other countries, so it is necessary to adopt a policy of thrift for foreign exchange expenditures on imports and other aspects. We must understand that under today's circumstances, it is not permissible for us to continue our economic life as usual. This is not only the case in China, but also in the various self-reliance measures recently promulgated in the United Kingdom, and the spirit of the British people in dealing with economic difficulties is sufficient for us to learn from.</p>
<p>Recently, China's international balance of payments deficit has gradually decreased. However, continued improvement requires our multifaceted efforts. The government is planning to find ways to promote exports in order to increase foreign exchange earnings, and hopes that it will have good results.</p>
<p>The work of the Balance Fund Committee is different from the work of the Sino-American-British Equalization Fund Committee that I previously held (Chen has been the chairman of the Equalization Fund Committee since 1941), because international trade almost completely stopped due to the war, and the current work is how to overcome the difficult period of recovery, so the method of handling it is also different.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be specifically pointed out that the foreign exchange problem is only a part of the entire economic problem. In order to achieve general economic stability, we cannot rely solely on foreign exchange policy, but also on the economic measures of other government agencies to cooperate with each other. Appropriate supply of daily necessities, price stability, and the gradual elimination of black market transactions are all the most important and indispensable measures. With the supply of foreign exchange for legitimate purposes, it is hoped that the black market can be gradually reduced.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of all the committee's work in the future will greatly depend on the cooperation and maintenance of the financial community and the public. This is what I cannot help but hope for.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen then answered questions raised by reporters from various newspapers, and members Xu and Shen supplemented the explanation. The main points are as follows: (1) The existence of the foreign exchange black market is not unique to our country. Even in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, and Hong Kong, this phenomenon exists. Eliminating the black market is the committee's main task, but many technical issues remain to be studied and resolved. At the same time, we hope that all parties will cooperate sincerely to achieve success. (2) The Balance Committee will strive to balance the fund's income and expenditure based on the two major principles of self-reliance and living within our means. (3) The source of the foreign exchange stabilization fund is mainly from promoting exports. Therefore, the government has decided to encourage exports, so that the proportion of imports can also be increased, and the prices can be stabilized. The increase in the quantity of exports will not make people's lives difficult, and the rational adjustment of foreign exchange will not have an impact on foreign market prices. (4) The value of Chinese legal tender has its own standard and position. There is no basis for the saying that it has a close connection with the US dollar or the British pound. However, there are currently more imports from the United States, resulting in a greater need for US foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Market Transactions Are Quiet, Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Unevenly</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were even more depressed yesterday, with quiet trading and no activity. Various stocks rose and fell unevenly. With the help of increased capital for New Light and Jingfu, floating capital gradually turned to them. The veteran stocks of the Commercial Press were also in greater demand than supply. The three were the most stable and all stood at high levels. Huafeng fell the most. The new match stocks entered the market, but compared with before the capital increase, they were just so-so. Yongsha once showed a small recovery midway due to the absorption of Chen of No. 116, Yang of No. 125, and the young and powerful faction of No. 52, but the follow-up was weak, and it still showed signs of dissension and departure when it closed, making the trend difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>The morning opening saw stability. After the opening of Yongsha, it was sold by No. 2224 and others to 238 yuan. No. 129 and others once advanced to 243 yuan, and No. 94 and others all sold. Later, it fell to 239 yuan. After 10 o'clock, No. 116 came in first, No. 16 also bought, and No. 35 bought a lot of spot, so it was pulled up to high prices of 242 yuan and 245 yuan.</p>
<p>After 10:30, the interest price outside the market opened at 16.5 points and 20 points. The market gradually consolidated. Then, No. 235 and No. 23 sold for delivery, and No. 97 sold for immediate delivery, forcing it down to around 240 yuan. At this time, foreign stocks were still firm, and people's hearts were still easy to cheer up. No. 76 and others absorbed them again, and they rose again to 242 yuan and 245 yuan. No. 28 and others sold off, and near noon, scattered buyers panicked, and Yongsha fell to low prices of 232 yuan and 237 yuan to end the day. The call price after the close was flat and tired, and New Light, Jingfu, and the Commercial Press closed at high prices.</p>
<p>As a result, compared with last Saturday's immediate delivery stocks, New Light and Jingfu rose slightly, Xinhe, Xinhua, and Qinxing were flat, Huafeng fell by half, Yongsha, Meiya, and Yonggong fell slightly, Datong underwear was also flat, the Commercial Press and Lian rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. The delivery stocks fell by half, Jingfu rose by half, New Light rose slightly, and Yongsha, Xinhe, Meiya, and Qinxing fell slightly. Various old stocks outside the market saw a slight decline.</p>
<h3>New Light Underwear to Increase Capital Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New Light Underwear Factory is scheduled to hold a temporary shareholders meeting on the 22nd of this month. The important proposals are said to be related to the discussion of asset appreciation issues. According to information from manager Wang Shisheng, the increase will be three shares for every three held, or four shares for every two held, but this has not yet been decided. According to information close to General Manager Liang Jun, the company has drafted a plan to build a new factory, which will be built on the open space of the Tangshan Road general factory. A "newest-type weaving factory" will be built there, which can accommodate 300 to 400 of the latest weaving machines to be imported from abroad. It is said that a large number of building materials are being actively purchased, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Consolidated Bonds Are Stable, Foreign Stocks Turn Strong</h3>
<p>The overall situation of public compensation yesterday turned from tired to stable, with various bonds experiencing different fortunes, but the process was still mediocre. Unified C opened in the morning at 14,000 yuan, with a low price of 13,600 yuan and a high price of 14,600 yuan, and then slightly flattened. Room 614 and others sold, and Room 503 and others bought, with a turnover of about 6 million. As a result, compared with last Saturday, A and B rose by 200 yuan, Unified C rose by 100 yuan, Unified D fell by 300 yuan, and Unified E fell slightly by 100 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation of foreign stocks turned strong yesterday, and buyers became more active. Yisha opened in the morning at 87,000 yuan and rose to 90,500 yuan before slightly consolidating. Securities gangs, bank gangs, and foreign merchants bought, while Jewish merchants, Guang gangs, and Jinhui gangs sold. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha, British Union, Weidefeng, Yeguang, Yisha Beer, Shipping, and Wool rose slightly. Paper, Steel, Telephone, and Xiangtai each rose by about half a percent.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Situation Is Firm</h3>
<p>A total of more than 7,400 shi arrived in the north and south markets yesterday. The weather was cloudy and rainy, and the digestion of japonica rice was still acceptable, and the situation was firm. Early Bo rice was vigorously consumed, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. White yuan was scarce and the market was firm, and the scarcity of yin yuan made it valuable, rising another 10,000 yuan. The situation of new japonica rice is set, and the consumption of indica rice is still sluggish, with high grades being stable and secondary grades being tired.</p>
<p>The price of flour remained unchanged, but an additional 10% of foreign flour was added, which was implicitly tightened. Mixed brand flour and unified flour rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bran sales in the countryside were active and the supply could not meet the demand, rising in a straight line, adding another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake consumption was cold and the situation turned sharply downward, falling sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories were all looking forward to seeing it rise, and customer sales stopped, and the change was very small. New soybeans were stepping up and becoming popular by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and Chen soybeans were also softening. Mung beans were slightly lower in volume, falling back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans had little arrival and sales, and the market situation stood still. Broad beans were not moving for customers, but there were still changes in the local street, and there were not many goods arriving, so the market was stable. Red sorghum was sold as soon as it arrived, with no breathing space for the time being.</p>
<p>Corn in the North remained depressed, and the South slightly accepted it, with no price fluctuations. Sesame had little inquiry from foreign dealers, and it was tired and stable. Raw peanuts from southern China were very tired, and the price fell by 10,000 yuan. New raw peanuts continued to fall sharply by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and wheat rose secretly, with little remaining and little arrival. In the afternoon, the factory sold large bags of bran for 85,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Stable Cooking Oil Prices</p>
<p>The supply of cooking oil has been maintained since the Bureau of Sales sold its inventory in the middle of last week and entrusted the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association to continuously sell it in large quantities on the market, and the market price on the morning of the 8th remained unchanged, no different from the end of last week. It is known that the association continued to sell 990 dan of soybean oil at 820,000 yuan and 1,200 dan of rapeseed oil at 740,000 yuan on the market yesterday. In addition, the Zhongzhi Shantou factory, on behalf of the Zhongshi Company, sold 65 barrels of raw oil (360 catties per barrel) for 1.06 million.</p>
<p>It is also known that Zhongzhi continues to maintain the regular distribution, and distributed 350 dan of rapeseed oil to retail oil shops from C No. 501 to No. 600 yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour Shipped to Qingdao</p>

<h3>US Dollar Short-Term Treasury Bills Resumed Sale Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The 36th year's US dollar short-term treasury bills resumed sale starting on the 8th. The sales area nationwide includes 19 locations: Shanghai, Nanjing, Peiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Xi'an, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Guilin, Wuzhou, Kunming, Haikou, Zhanjiang, and Jiangmen.

It is said that in addition to the three banks of the China Communications Bank, the Postal Remittance Bureau, and the China Trust Bureau, all other commercial banks have stopped selling them on behalf. The amount of 20 million yuan issued in September will be distributed to Shanghai for 10 million yuan, and the remaining 10 million yuan will be distributed to other locations for sale by the national bank.</p>
<p>Regarding the past sales situation, an official from the National Bank stated yesterday that the US dollar short-term treasury bills began to be sold on April 7th of this year. On August 17th, due to the promulgation of the revised foreign exchange management regulations, they were temporarily suspended. A total of 27,525,920 US dollars were sold, of which the sales volume in various locations was the highest in Shanghai, with 13,588,970 US dollars. The second was Nanjing, with 4,931,590 US dollars.

<h3>Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Increases, 20-Count Yarn Listed at 11.2 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The negotiated price of cotton yarn by the Spinning and Weaving Association was 11.2 million yuan for 20-count yarn yesterday, an increase of 100,000 yuan from the previous day. The prices of other counts of yarn were calculated proportionally.</p>
<p>Yesterday, China Spinning and Weaving Company still sold yarn in Group A and Group B. Group A sold a total of 788 pieces, with 338 application forms. Group B sold a total of 1,145 pieces, with 831 application forms. A total of 1,933 pieces of yarn were sold, equivalent to 3,113 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 1,169 application forms.</p>
<p>Stable Yarn Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was initially firm due to the increase in the listed price of yarn sold by the Spinning and Weaving Company on behalf of the Spinning and Weaving Association. The prices were slightly higher across the board. Later, due to the completion of a large number of profitable long positions, and the fact that the Spinning and Weaving Company distributed a large amount, while the actual demand was still stagnant, the market turned soft. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn and 20-count Special Double Horse were flat.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Trends Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation was that the actual sales slightly improved due to the weather turning cooler. Local street purchases were not lonely, and customer gangs also had sporadic additions, but dyeing factories were still less active. The number of chips on the market was insufficient, and the market was trending firm. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth made a high of 498,000 yuan, continuing to rise by 8,000 yuan compared to Saturday.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Rises Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of current cotton was stable. Yarn factories continued to absorb it, people's hearts were firm, and trading was slightly more active than on Saturday. The price was secretly better by 20,000 to 30,000.</p>
<h3>Rayon Stagnation</h3>
<p>Due to sluggish actual sales and depreciating distribution prices, rayon lacks the momentum to increase in price. Yesterday, the market price for brands like "120" Golden Three Horses and Tianqiao opened at 25.7 million yuan, with the lowest price reaching 2.56 million yuan. Factory prices remained unchanged from last weekend, but buyers' bids were very low. Consequently, no transactions occurred for high-uniformity five-bundle thread, while only a dozen or so bundles were traded. Silk goods were generally firm. True silk quilt covers opened between 12.23 and 12.24 million yuan, with the largest transaction reaching 12.26 million yuan. The prices of Dacheng and Huaqiang were the same, while Huajin crepe was priced at 24,500 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Over Seventy Silk Factories Registered for Autumn Cocoon Loans</h3>

This afternoon, the committee will convene a committee meeting to appoint a subcommittee to review the qualifications of the registered factories. After finalizing the complete list on the 10th, starting from the 11th, the approved factories can individually sign loan contracts with the Farmers Bank of China.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this year's autumn cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is estimated to yield 80,000 dan of fresh cocoons, equivalent to 20,000 dan of dried cocoons. It is reported that the official weighing and purchasing of cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang will begin on the 14th.</p>
<h3>How Designated Banks Settle and Sell Foreign Exchange for Regular Expenses</h3>
<p>National Bank Regulations Separately Stipulated</p>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the settlement and sale of foreign exchange for the regular expenses of designated banks, the Central Bank issued Circular No. 112 yesterday to all designated banks, stating: "Regarding your bank's applications for foreign exchange for regular expenses, relevant regulations have been previously stipulated in our Circular No. 100.

<h3>Three Chapters of Setting Sun</h3>
<p>— Cao Guoping</p>
<p>City River</p>
<p>In the evening, I always like to go to this clear and wide city river alone.</p>
<p>The scarlet afterglow falls on the river surface, reflecting a light yellow wave of light, inlaid with apple green edges, how beautiful!</p>
<p>This mirror-like river surface, without a trace of ripples, is as quiet as the surface of the Sea of Galilee after being rebuked by Jesus.</p>
<p>The city river, carrying the heavy burden of the day, can now rest. No, it only knows how to supply, not to be rewarded; it only contributes, not wanting to enjoy. It enhances the convenience of cargo transportation, reduces the arduous steps of passengers. It also preserves the warmth, peace, and fraternity in the Garden of Eden, and still carries the auspiciousness of the Penglai Immortal Island.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a large boat loaded with straw sailed past, and the calm river waves immediately splashed up waves, rolled up rotating whirlpools, and the reeds on both sides were agitated and swayed不停…………。</p>
<p>The river surface returned to quiet, and this light yellow, continuous wave of light began to be covered with a layer of dark green...gradually deep, deep....</p>
<p>I only hope that this city river rests quietly and peacefully, no longer enduring any noise and excitement</p>
<p>On the way home, I could not help but sigh to myself</p>
<p>——Am I not like this city river? Unable to get a moment's rest, every worldly affair that passes through my heart will stir up inner pain, stimulation, and煩惱……When will I get安宁呢？</p>
<p>Always before the sunset fades, a crystal bright evening star with a faint light drills out in the western sky to say hello to the world.</p>
<p>Since I was a child, I have had a habit of loving the evening star, but I don’t know why, only because I saw it appear earliest and it is considered extremely large among the stars.</p>
<p>Now I find it even more lovely and beautiful. It is the light and sound of the night, it is the loyal prophet, warning us of the approaching darkness and reporting to us the power of darkness. When the evening star arrives, it disappears invisibly into the night, is it escaping the curse and claws of the god of night? Was it swallowed by the darkness?</p>
<p>Seeing the evening star, I also think of a close friend who sacrificed himself for the country. In his last letter, he wrote: "My current situation is just like the evening star in the sky. Although the dangerous and dark future is my only strong enemy and once completely swallowed me, I am doing my best now...</p>
<p>In the twilight, taking a cool in the garden, I always see the evening star. I thank it for giving me a lot of memories and revelations.</p>
<p>Bugle Call</p>
<p>The residue faded in the blue sky, and the bugle call from the military camp in the south of the city was sent with the習凉 wind during practice.</p>
<p>I understand that this is practicing the ceasefire call—it is沉东,激越,嘹喨—When it flashed across my fragile and fickle soul, this tone was particularly poignant, solemn, and tragic. It made me produce an inexplicable sorrow, hooked the tears of repentance, I felt that this had been蕴藏for a long time, just一直给世俗的瘴气抑退….</p>
<p>This bugle call made me begin to feel that I was like a soldier with a顧頷 face, a bleeding body, and a路躓step who was wounded and关来的from the battlefield of life. I felt that the joy of the flesh had faded, and the struggle of life had lost its taste. I feel that people who貪食"fame, fortune, power, and desire" wisdom fruit are always subjected to the permanent sword pain of the soul.</p>
<p>In the colorful and prosperous city, I am like a crazy wild horse galloping aimlessly on the broad塲, like a lamp moth that can never satisfy its desires, like an ostrich that always exposes its body and feet to conceal its sins, like….</p>
<p>Thank this bugle call, it once again gave me the opportunity to open my spiritual eyes, made me recognize the true meaning of life, and made me guard my soul better than guarding everything. But I am afraid of tomorrow's dusk bugle call, which is another tear-inducing agent of潸潸tears.</p>
<h3>Sartre's New Play Script</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The most noteworthy existentialist in our country, Jean Paul Sartre (1905-), has newly compiled two plays, which have been staged in Paris and have not yet been translated into English, namely "Morts Sans Sepulture" and "La Putain Respectueuse." Now I will introduce the plots of these two plays below:</p>
<p>"Unburied Corpses" tells the story of several rebels who were captured by military and political organs, locked in a high-rise building of a school, waiting for interrogation and torture in the classroom below. The authorities tried every means to increase the punishment, drinking and drunk, while listening to the noisy radio, saying some boring nonsense. The prisoners upstairs discussed a method,宁愿受苦, unwilling to reveal secrets, and everyone acted in unison.</p>
<p>During the continued torture, one prisoner jumped out of the window and committed suicide, and another prisoner was too young, and his sister was afraid that he did not understand the meaning of "brave", so she allowed him to be纹死. The climax of this drama should be the victory of the prisoners, and the words they said to the judges were all lies. But unexpectedly, the result was that the highest authority, Clochet, did not want their evidence and confessions and shot them all. Perhaps Sartre wanted to ask us: "In front of a tyrannical (Sadism) person, what is the use of these prisoners' courage?"</p>
<p>"The Respectful Prostitute" opens in a bungalow of a prostitute in New York. Someone accused a certain black man of raping a white woman. The black man asked the prostitute Li Xi (Lizzie) to prove that he had not committed a crime. She agreed to this request, but later broke the约; at this time, a senator deceived her, talking about patriotism with her, knowing that she was thirsty for noble people, and used this to fool her.</p>
<p>Later, the chased black man hid in her bungalow, and she hid him. But the senator's son, Hu Lide, wanted to ask her for help and found the black man. He used a pistol to hit the然人, but did not hit him. The black man escaped. Li Xi raised his gun and aimed at Hu Lide. Hu Lide persuaded her with words, and the conclusion was: "My father is a senator, and soon I will be a senator after him. I have the right to live. A woman like you should not hit someone like me."</p>
<p>Later, Hu Lide proposed to Li Xi, promising to give her a mansion to live in in order to pass the time. A black man was lynched (but not the one to be caught), and the crowd went home satisfied. This drama also illustrates the uselessness of struggle. Critics call this a light comedy.</p>
<h3>Feeling About the Preliminary Meeting of the Treaty of Peace with Japan That Is About to Be Convened</h3>

<p>Everywhere there are still ashes of thousands of households, who is it that arbitrarily advocates peace? Let him make strange promises of democracy, and the hawk eye often misses cunning建才.</p>
<p>The blood on Pearl Harbor is still初乾, but what can be done to扬意转安, how many冤魂沈海底, and then看握手话新缘.</p>
<p>受难当时谁最深, poor猿鹤百年心; 属齐属楚情犹昔,赢缕得缘忆欢音。</p>
<p>属国千载不寻仇, hearing that Wumen still has a楼; If 式绳人 comes again, I am willing to make Wu Yuan's头</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jinfeng</p>
<p>As soon as he walked to the bridge that divides the Special Zone and the "French Concession", Little Tiger suddenly gave Yaoqun a warning signal.</p>
<p>"I want to go and see the熟闹, Aunt Ji!" After the warning signal, Little Tiger suddenly made this request to Yaoqun; it was completely in the tone of a rural child.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Yaoqun stopped Little Tiger, and continued to pay attention to the pedestrians coming and going. Seeing that there was no divergent object, he asked Little Tiger: "What's going on?" The attitude was very 평담, just like a brother and sister chatting idly.</p>
<p>"On the road in front, I saw something like "出会" and "赶集", which must be very lively. They went north." Saying this, he lowered his voice: "You go find a place to rest first, and I will find you later..." He handed the two small parcels to Yaoqun. Little Tiger's actions have always been so rapid and resolute.</p>
<p>"Don't放野, come back earlier,...wait for you to have lunch!..." Yaoqun hurried to tell this, and patted Little Tiger on the shoulder lightly, and sent away this little beast hunter.</p>
<p>The bridge and the road in front are no less than three hundred yards away. Although the bridge is higher than the 평路, ordinary people would not see the detailed and clear dynamics of the distant road at a glance; at most, they could only see some people and horses shaking. Yaoqun knew that Little Tiger's eyesight was much stronger than ordinary people, and also knew that he must have seen something, so he let him go.</p>
<p>"North??...What is this place to the north?..." Yaoqun walked while taking the two words Little Tiger said as a key, hoping to figure out a clue. But because Yaoqun was not very familiar with the territory of Tianjin, he did not know that the French Concession stabbed the north was the "Japanese Concession", so he could not推想a reason for a while.</p>
<p>"Damn, whose descendants are having bad luck again!" One of the two shop assistants who greeted Yaoqun was dressed like this,咕哝; it was like议讽, and like愤慨.</p>
<p>"Let's eat more and talk less!" Another one spoke in pure Tianjin dialect: "Damn, what kind of world is this today? Ghosts may smear their heads in broad daylight! Anyway, we don't乱霎our eyes, and we don't多话our mouths, that's right...."</p>
<p>"...There are a total of a dozen people!" Again, an old man and two young people came over, a child in his teens, wearing an open-necked shirt and long trousers; some looked like Little Tiger's outfit, but they were much more neat; walking and talking to the old man: "Seven or eight young ones, like college students, four or five older ones look like teachers..."</p>
<p>"I saw that their hands are connected in pairs, and they are all拴着with iron locks..." Another younger child发表 his observations.</p>
<p>"That's an iron lock? Ha, don't let people laugh off their chins; they don't even know a foreign handcuff...."</p>
<p>"Walk the道儿罢, don't be so瞎撩,...we will definitely go to the countryside tomorrow, it's not good to待哪 here!..."The elderly man悄声低语叹息when passing Yaoqun.</p>
<p>The above five people's chats描画 gave Yaoqun a粗技大叶轮廓of the "incident" scenery line on the road just now. The more he moved forward, the more參老information he collected; he used these data to拼凑 into a tragedy, which was probably the matter of Little Tiger chasing紫.</p>
<h3>Roadside</h3>
<p>— Li Weichu</p>
<p>I often think like this——that may be a subconsciousness, once "When today passes, if I can no longer calculate the days of tomorrow in my mind, or if I can't count the estimates for the next month in this month, I will be relaxed." However, in fact, there is always a kind of worry deeply pressing on my heart, and there is always a shadow tightly following; it is not scary, but the consciousness clearly and transcendentally stands outside the material life, and calls to raise the spirit above the actual life; but occasionally I hear one or two sentences that the things have漲,——this is really a serious threat to the burden of my salary for a family of four.——Therefore, it forms my state of opposition between spirit and matter. I cannot surpass the influence and stimulation of this actual life on the spirit!</p>
<p>As usual, this is a beautiful dusk, the shallow light of the setting sun softly shines on the road. It's time to get off work, I chose to walk in the shade on the roadside, a person with a broken leg and残肢is begging on the roadside with a harsh cry. This is a tragic scene. Usually, when these people stretch out their hands to beg, I can't bear to let them shrink back empty-handed. If it is an old beggar, I will feel even more sad and unbearable. Although I am not a humanitarian, the so-called "惻隱之心,人皆有之". Maybe I can only weakly give this useless sympathy.</p>
<p>But now, there are too many unfortunate events, and people's sympathy is gradually thinning and淡渺; after that, I gradually learn to be忍心, and when facing凄凉and misfortune, I also learn to be毫不动情; watching them stretch out their begging hands, I run away quickly, escaping their begging. At first, sometimes I would feel sad and ashamed, and vaguely be condemned by my conscience, thinking that I had堕落and learned badly. But after a long time, I became习以为常, and this emotion gradually disappeared, and there would be no more voices in my heart to責備. If there is, at that time, the brilliance of the soul is the most bright……</p>
<p>Because of these kinds of thoughts rising and falling in my mind, my pace became slow. Not far from the front, there was a group of people圍, and looking again, there was a pool of bright red blood flowing on the ground. I thought it was a rickshaw that had been overturned, and a car had injured someone again; but, no, the bright red blood made me very afraid, I dare not look, but the more I dare not look, the more the curiosity in my heart is加倍鼓动, so I walked over. When I arrived in that crowd, I saw that it was a middle-aged poor woman sitting in that pool of blood as if in a coma.——I dare not look at that extremely painful face; this scene made me feel palpitations immediately, blood, the bright red blood made my hands and feet酥软. I heard someone whispering quietly:</p>
<p>"She walked here, and the stomach pain started to be利害, and she couldn't walk anymore."</p>
<p>"Is she about to give birth"? Another woman in her thirties with淸秀features frowned and said.</p>
<p>I immediately退出来, picked a kind-looking face and asked: "Why didn't anyone send her to the hospital"?</p>
<p>"Someone reported it, I'm afraid it will be here in a while." Coincidentally, this is also a northern accent.</p>
<p>I didn't ask another question, and didn't dare to look more, although I seemed to really want to stay here for a while to see if someone would come and send her to the hospital. But at that time, it seemed that I was very sad in my heart, and my mood was very heavy, and I couldn't stand there for a while longer. Like a patient, I dragged my heavy steps and walked away. Although I had a pool of tears in my eyes, I silently blessed this woman who was giving birth on the roadside, and at the same time silently wished for the birth of this baby. When he grew up, decades later he should know that his mother gave birth to him on the roadside; he should remember his mother, remember this road. After he knows all this, what should娜he do? What kind of person should he be?</p>
<p>I thought silently, my thoughts were煩乱and紛纭.</p>
<p>After I went home that night, I was always silent? My thoughts and feelings are serious and heavy. My mother still thought that I had something unpleasant in the office, but I only gave a slight苦笑, and could not explain. Because for this era, this society, the ways of life and situations of all kinds of people, the great suffering of this crowd, there are really too many things that need to be explained,——I can only be silent.</p>
<h3>Night Sky</h3>
<p>— Shi Hong</p>
<p>Every day, I long for the dusk to sprinkle from the gaps in the locust leaves. I want to lean on the window, and whisper to the starry sky.</p>
<p>On the moonlit and wind清之night, the stars appeared from the sky. Clustered together, the dresses studded with coral beads shimmered, like going to a night party on a beach. Polaris is the host, and Ursa Major is his giant兕. He is drunk, the starlight shimmers, like an endearing smile after drinking, like beautiful and hazy drunk eyes.</p>
<p>A strip of silver-white light, flowing through央in the sky, this is the Milky Way. On both sides of it, there are more densely sitting groups of dazzling stars; is it to临淸流and濯足after酒酣耳热, or to曲水流觞, imitate the charming things of the world?</p>
<p>An arc of light劃过天空, and a star is seen falling in the world. Is it because the daughters are娇力弱, unable to胜酒后的恣情狂笑, and香消玉殒? Or is he amorous and放浪, so that he has violated the heavenly rules and was謫to the world?</p>
<p>All this, I don't want to know, isn't a question that doesn't seek an answer more complete. I leaned on the window, but I heard their soft whispers and laughter, and struck the festival and sang. My heart was飄飘忽忽牵引得悠远又悠远, as if it was gradually merging with them.</p>
<p>So, I opened the mysterious book of the universe,体染伟大和渺小, short and eternal, the existing meaning of life.</p>
<p>Until the hunter星魁伟地appearances, the host of the night party said goodbye to the guests one by one, with倦怠和兴奋, and made a plan for the next day's meeting. The hunter star is the servant who专门司 and 除残餚, right?</p>
<p>The morning star讥诮 from the branches of the locust tree, and关了 the window. I shared the intoxication, just like I just came back from a strange banquet.</p>

<h3>Words for "Sports Festival"</h3>
<p>— Cai Zhiwei</p>
<p>Today is Sports Day.</p>
<p>On the personal side, if you want to develop your career, you must make your body healthy; on the national side, if you want to strengthen the country, the people must be healthy. The so-called strengthening the body can strengthen the species, and then step into the road of strengthening the country, which lies in this.</p>
<p>Although schools in Shanghai are very发达, there are still many schools that use lane houses as school buildings and do not have sports塲. This is a serious problem. Shanghai sports人土should come up with a way, such as several schools sharing a sports塲, so that the general youth and children have the opportunity to锻炼体格. In order to bring Shanghai school sports into正轨, the education authorities should give guidance and assistance. The teaching materials of school sports should also be researched and discussed for improvement.</p>
<p>At present, there are two major problems in the Shanghai sports world that need to be solved:</p>
<p>(1) Talent个题: There used to be a large number of sports talents in Shanghai, but some are now tired of work, and some have retired due to old age. Due to the development of schools, sports teachers, if calculated as two in middle schools and one in primary schools, also need thousands of sports teachers. Moreover, folk groups need a large number of sports guidance talents, so Shanghai is even more lacking in sports talents. For the sake of Shanghai sports, the municipal government should set up more special physical education schools and reward the establishment of private special physical education schools to cultivate talents to solve the panic of talents.</p>
<p>(2) Funding issues: The old saying goes, "A clever woman can't cook without rice." Although the Shanghai sports world has a good system and plan, it often cannot engage in development due to insufficient funding. Therefore, the government should include national sports funding in the budget and allocate it reasonably. If the Shanghai sports world has sufficient financial resources, it will be able to enrich sports facilities and develop sports undertakings. In a few years, Shanghai's sports will be able to develop to an ideal state.</p>
<p>As for. Other塲地设备 and other issues are all related to economic issues, and there is no need to赘言.</p>
<h3>On Nurseries</h3>
<p>— Yu Shan</p>
<p>— A Call for the You You Nursery</p>
<p>When people eat a tree's abundant fruit, they only know its sweetness but don't think of the planter's hard work. When a child grows up, becoming a certain kind of person, some parents don't even realize it's their own responsibility. Fortunately, the nation has established nurseries and childcare centers! If every center could take on this important mission, it might still not feel like enough capacity, especially since some centers are nothing more than trophies for ordinary ladies to show off their vanity! This is not only something everyone should pay attention to, but it is indeed a crucial and unique mission for the nation's prosperity and women's liberation.</p>
<p>Have I not also often neglected my children's care because I need to work to earn a living? Thinking about their urgent need to be placed in a suitable home in the future, I visited many centers before finally finding them a sweet and quiet home: the newly established You You Nursery, which has been open for less than a year, is their temporary hometown. Due to space limitations, it can only accommodate eighty children. The healthy and lively demeanor of each child is enough to prove that the founder has accomplished this great mission. The children can eat five meals a day, including fruits, milk, and eggs, which is especially rare. What's even more commendable is that every time I visit, I see the director, Ms. Ye Shuke, personally supervising the children's daily lives. Recently, they even hired an expert in child psychology to help her take care of everything in the center. They are constantly and humbly researching methods of childcare. The nannies and staff in the center are all kind and amiable. The only shortcoming is that Ms. Ye is struggling to raise funds for this little paradise. There are still more than twenty registered children who cannot enter because the house is too small; this paradise is just a three-story building. In terms of finances, it has not received any subsidies from any organizations. However, the fees for children's food and lodging are extremely low. Among the eighty children, some are even free of charge. There is a child without a father, whose mother is unemployed and sick; she has not only not paid for food and lodging for three or four months, but even her clothes are provided by the center. I once held that pitiful child. She was chubby and very cute, and she talked and laughed with me.</p>
<p>Therefore, due to these urgent needs, the You You Nursery's board of directors, including Chairman Song Ying, wife of Shang Zhen, as well as Mr. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, and Chen Qicai, are working together to lead and assist in preparing a charity performance at the Golden Theatre in mid-month to raise funds. I am deeply moved by Ms. Ye's compassionate and great spirit of service, and I deeply feel the profound significance of this matter. I wish the You You Nursery and the more than twenty registered children a bright future. I hope that this charity performance will receive enthusiastic support and assistance from all sectors!</p>
<h3>Illegal Late-Night Business</h3>
<p>— Excerpt from this newspaper, August 25th, Guangxu 19th year</p>
<p>The police station has restrictions on the operating hours of entertainment venues, but there are still lawless individuals who secretly extend the time. If the police station discovers this, they will be punished accordingly. It was found that similar incidents occurred fifty years ago, but not in dance halls, but in opium dens.</p>
<p>"Each opium den inside and outside the city of this county must close at 9 p.m. and shut its doors at 10 p.m. This is a fixed rule, and violations will be investigated. Zhou Sanfu and others opened an opium den in Yangjia Ferry Lane in the southern part of Shanghai, which was lit up late at night. It was discovered by the Baojia Chief Inspector Zhang Sima. Therefore, the previous night, he took Jia Yong to investigate and found that Zhou and Wang Yousheng, Yao Pinshan, Luo Changsheng, and Qiu Xiangyun, among others, had not yet closed their businesses. The bureau was immediately ordered to bring Zhou and the other five people, as well as their doorplates, back. The bureau interrogated them, and Zhou and the others kowtowed and begged for mercy. Sima said: 'The doorplates should have been revoked, but considering that it is the first offense, leniency will be granted.' The doorplates were returned separately, and Zhou and the others were severely reprimanded, and they were asked to provide written guarantees for the record."

<h3>The 1948 World Olympic Games</h3>
<p>— Translated by Baishi</p>
<p>Apart from Germany and Japan, all the countries in the world have received invitations from the "Preparatory Committee of the 14th World Olympic Games" to participate in the grand event that will be held in London from July 29th to August 14th, 1948.</p>
<p>Although the Games are still a year away, many members of the preparatory committee have already started working in London. In the summer of 1948, the British mainland will inevitably be affected by the post-war scarcity of materials, but the British government has decided to provide the "best of everything" to the approximately five thousand athletes and officials.</p>
<p>The stadiums for various competitions have already been prepared. The "Wembley Stadium" in the northwest of Greater London, which is the best outdoor competition venue in Britain, is now constructing hundreds of dressing rooms with comfortable facilities such as showers and hot water faucets. In the coming year, a brand-new outdoor swimming pool, many new parks and parking lots, a "stretch the muscles" practice track, and a new avenue leading to the stadium will be built.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Sir Arthur Elvin, "Wembley Stadium" is preparing for various events in a very thorough and seamless manner. It will allow 100,000 spectators to watch all the competitions with satisfaction. Near the "Imperial Pool," a boxing ring will be built; once the boxing program is over, a large number of skilled workers will dismantle the ring and prepare the swimming pool almost overnight.</p>
<p>Various competitions that are not suitable for "Wembley" will use other world-renowned outdoor sports venues. For example, rowing - participants must bring their own canoes - will be held on the "Henley Regatta" river; cycling will be held on the famous "Herne Hill Velodrome" in south London, and shooting competitions will be held in "Bisley". A first-class gymnasium that can accommodate at least 300 basketball players has not yet been found; and wrestling competitions also have their special problems, because the size of the mats stipulated by the World Games is not produced in Britain.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about preparing the "Olympia Torch". The fuel research department of the organizing committee is designing to use a huge magnifying glass to concentrate the sun's rays on Mount Olympus in northern Greece to light a torch. Regardless of wind or rain, day or night, this torch will be "carried by athletes from various countries in a relay race, passing through Europe, and arriving at "Wembley Stadium" on the opening day of the Games to light the "Olympia Flame" - this flame will be visible to all spectators and athletes day and night during the Games.</p>
<p>Note: Due to today's crowded manuscripts, "American Miscellany" will be suspended for one day.</p>

<h3>Film Scene This Week</h3>
<p>Clumsy Spy Film "Thorny Rose"</p>
<p>If you have a good memory, you will still remember the film "Spring River Regret," which promoted the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere during the occupation period, which was co-directed by Yue Feng and the enemy.</p>
<p>The director of this "Thorny Rose" is Yue Feng.</p>
<p>If we still admit that movies are weapons for educating the public, then what impact will the films directed by the same person, from "Spring River Regret" to the current "Thorny Rose," have on the audience? Is the movie really dark?</p>
<p>Let's look at this "Thorny Rose" again. It depicts the story of Chongqing's intelligence personnel and the puppet regime's special agents. However, due to the fictitious nature of the story and the lack of reality in the content, the male protagonist, Lu Jialiang, defected from Chongqing's intelligence personnel to the puppet side's special agent, Guan Ziwansanye, without any process, making it difficult for people to understand. Finally, Li Jingdan sneaked into Wan's mansion for two nights to throw bombs, which was completely fantasy and child's play. In short, it is a clumsy spy drama.</p>
<p>Actors: Luo Lan's first time on the screen, this achievement is extremely rare; Yan Hua is excessive and impetuous.</p>
<p>The Ups and Downs of a Female Performer—"Tianqiao"</p>
<p>This play depicts the ups and downs of a female performer. Through the life of the female performer Hua Xiaofeng, the author outlines the darkness of this society. However, because the author used too many and mixed materials, it could not be focused, and the story was too long, from before the war to after the war. This includes praising the loyalty of the old performer Mu Hongchun, the steadfastness of some old opera performers, the lawlessness of local gangsters, collusion with the enemy and puppets, Hua Xiaofeng's deception and escape, and finally her downfall. However, these are only superficial descriptions in the author's pen, and they have not been explored in depth, so they cannot leave a deep impression on the audience.</p>
<p>The director's handling of the play is difficult to explain, but it seems powerless. Those Peking opera scenes are both rigid and boring, and the understanding of the play is also superficial, only moving the clear and smooth play to the stage. This is a craftsman rather than an artist.</p>
<p>Du Zhu's first time on the screen, although the acting skills are still stiff, overall, she is qualified. This is a promising talent with a very promising future. Yan Shaopeng is not very natural, but not too excessive. This is not easy for a new actor to achieve. Xu Huan's Mrs. Feng Si is the best actor in the whole play.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong's acting is still stable and responsible.</p>
<p>Biographical Film "Rhapsody in Blue"</p>
<p>"Rhapsody in Blue" is a biographical film that depicts the life of the modern American musician George Gershwin, and can be called a sister work to the recently released "Hans Christian Andersen". We will not discuss the achievements of these two musicians. Speaking of the script alone, then this "Rhapsody in Blue" is more dramatic. Although the love triangle greatly helped the rich drama of this script, George Gershwin's life experience is not exceptionally humane and vivid in the processing of the screenwriter.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the director's achievements cannot be considered successful, and many scenes are handled very loosely.</p>
<p>Lobert Arda, who played George Gershwin, is quite good. It is said that this is a new actor on the screen for the first time, which is even more commendable. Joan Leslie's performance is beautiful, lively and lovely. Alec Steele Smith's performance is excellent.</p>
<p>The music in this film is worth listening to.</p>
<p>"Blood Sea Loyal Souls" and "Paratrooper Blood Battle on the Rhine"</p>
<p>"Blood Sea Loyal Souls" was produced by a small American film company. The technology is very simple, the script material is old, and the actors have no better achievements. The other film "Paratrooper Blood Battle on the Rhine" is a war documentary released by British "Gaumont". The play is very simple, but lacks brilliance. The reason why this film can sell out is because it understands the light of "fake phoenixes".</p>

<h3>Engineers with Meager Income Wish to Take on Art and Graphic Design</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a so-called "Bachelor of Engineering" degree holder and an unnamed engineer with more than nine years of work experience. Because I have relatively exquisite architectural design and drawing perspective diagrams and other "skills" and rich construction experience, I still have a relatively stable "civil servant" position today. It is said that I am a lucky member, but I have to use the tens of thousands of yuan of salary I earn from my hard work every month to support a family of seven. If there are no unexpected expenses, I can barely get by with a month of vegetable and rice meals. But now I am already two months behind on my salary, because my wife and children have been sick for more than two months, not pneumonia, but malnutrition or stomach problems. These three diseases all require long-term recuperation. Under these circumstances, it is not necessary to elaborate on my pain. I once thought about changing careers to do business, but I don't have the capital, and it's not necessarily profitable; I thought about suicide, but I couldn't bear to kill seven lives. Now I think the only thing I can do is to find a position in the industrial and commercial sector or an agency with a higher salary (a trial period can be given first). I can also be responsible for designing drawings for advertisements, furniture, fashion, etc. If there is anyone who needs me, please send a letter to Ren Shiqi, Linliao Warehouse, Hangjiang Yarn Factory, 138 Daxijie, Hangzhou. Sincerely, I wish you well.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Jiang Fengsheng</p>
