<h3>我國外交人事制度　尹司長談已建立良好基礎</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕我國外交人事制度，近已建立良好基礎，趨於正軌，堪爲其他行政人員人事制度之楷模，從事外效之正式外交官員，職業上亦獲得相當保障，外交行政人員及使領館職員簡　以下者，均係考選，並逐步實施「內外互調」之原則。記者十二日走訪外部前任人事年畏尹葆字氏，承將目前外交人事制度，闡述如下：目前外交人員之任用，均係根據政府高等及普通考試及格者中分別選用，部中爲補在國家考試制度下所得人才之不足，自支年起特設立「擬任人員　選委員會」，定期舉行考試，選拔人才補助前此之推　辦法。現除蘭任官外，專員科長以下職員入外交界服務，均須經該委員會之　試。至一般之考選委員會及銓敘部商求改進樹立制度，逐步實施。尹氏繼稱，外交人員之內外互調原則，爲蔣主席於兼代部務時親自厘定者，旨在使國內及海外人員，對職務洞悉瞭解，並收理論與實際並重之效。現派赴海外人員以三年爲一任，寒熱帶區則爲二年兩任，期滿後儘可能內外互調職務，戰時因交通關係，未能充分實現，現已逐漸實施。尹氏就目前互調之情况稱，戰後各地使領館相率恢復，我國因國際地位较戰前提高，各國家與我新建外交關係，使領价随之增多，我國外交常局向重保僑而海外若干地方，華僑，蒙受戰争影響，　待政府保護，尤以越南及荷印等地爲甚，政府戰後於上述地万增設領館甚多，外派領館人員自亦随之增加。又以年来國際會議頻仍，因之實際外派人食，遠較内調者爲多。記者最後詢及關於外交官員職業上之保障問題，據尹氏答稱，凡經考試入外交界服務者，非有特殊過失，其上司不得籍故　免其職務，海外人員於任內，主管人非有特殊原因，亦不能調動。又目前派赴國外領館之主管均係具右曾在外館服服務騐者充任，目的則在增强各領事之應付能力。按尹葆宇現已調任外交部歐洲司長，其遗缺則由于能模繼任。</p>

<h3>關於對日賠償計劃　美駁斥蘇聯指責　日對盟國要求勢難接收</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東十二日電〕莫斯科短波無綫電之廣播中透露：蘇聯在莫斯科會議中堅持之政策，即要求以現行工業生產賠償作爲簽訂和約之條件·亦將引用於日本和約問題。該評詮由西米爾諾夫用英語廣播，渠稱：「一部份日木工業，特別爲軍火工業，需加以澈底之毀滅，而另一部份可作爲和平生產者，應供應賠償品，由和約之規定，在一定時期內將日本之工業配備以及一部份日本工業之現行生產移交太平洋各國作爲賠款，可協助恢復在戰事中被　壞之國家」。廣播中並未提及蘇聯賠款之要求，僅指稱：美國欲將大部份賠款撥付與美國經濟相聯繫之團家。</p>
<p>廣播中亦再度提出對美國佔領政策與賠償計劃之攻擊，指出原來列爲賠款之日本工廠五百家，包括地下飛機二十四家已被榜上除名，此種計劃實爲美國欲將日本變爲「美國軍事戰略與經齊基地」計劃之一部份。</p>
<p>盟軍總部工業組之發言人稱：渠實不知蘇聯何從而取得此消賠款工廠之結計，遠東委員會擬獄作賠款用之工廠千餘家，而完全確定者到今未及半數，同一問題蘇聯已數度提出，而盟軍總部前致達萊夫揚柯（蘇聯駐日代表團團長）已指出若干工廠之除名，乃僅除「名」而未除其「實」。例如地下飛機廠之配備，容易受潮濕之侵蝕而損壞，故乃遷至地上倉庫，或者名單中廠名有重複者，或已全被炸燬者，當然亦加取消，有一軍火廠之被除名，蓋其實際上爲製造電話用具，正爲佔領當局之所需者。眞正恐因撥作賠款後將影響日本之國民經濟而將其除名之工廠未及十家，然添加於名單中之工廠乃有二十五家。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十二日電〕盟國方面消息靈通人士今日宣稱：日本關係各國所已提出或將提出之賠償要求，總數當達數千億美元之巨，實非日本國內外資產所能應付。記者問是否可用長期償付辦法？某消息靈通人士答曰：上次世界大戰後；協約國曾要求德長期賠償，結果如何乎？</p>
<h3>日所有掠奪物品　幾全部盜自我國　各國代表主張逐戶搜查</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十二日電〕我駐日代表團賠償組長吳半農，偕同其他盟國代表至各地視察日本掠奪之物品，今巳歸來。渠認爲所見物品甚少，盟軍總部曾命令日本政府詳細報吿掠刧品情形，然日本顯未照辦。渠認各博物院圖書館私人收集物品，均應予以調查，而賠償工作，亦應加緊進行，因迄今吾人僅觸及問題之表面而已。吳氏稱：東京·福岡·大阪·名古屋之倉庫，均經視察，渠見自中國刧掠來之銅鐘及石獅甚多，而掠刧物品中百分之九十五，均係來自中國，餘者則係南洋各地特品。吳氏將於本月末偕同其他國家代表至北海道從事調查工作。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十二日電〕菲律賓派赴日本之賠償及歸還代表團主任亞勃萊拉頃談稱：渠欲在日本實行「逐戶」檢查，以收回日人在戰期內所刧掠之物品。亞氏最近方自日本南部搜尋贓物歸來，幷謂：「日本曾在菲島逐戶掠取物品，吾人尋回此等物品之唯一妥善辦法，亦祗有實行逐戶搜查」。渠又稱：渠對日人因率盟軍總部之命令而宣佈之刧掠品數量大感失望。　此間法國賠償及歸還代表團主任杜克萊斯脫聲稱：渠對此亦表失望，故認爲盟電總部應頒布命令，凡日人違令不肯繳出刧掠品者，處以重罰。日本要人及前海陸軍人員之寓所應立即加以搜查，凡隱匿刧掠物品而經查獲者均須受懲，幷須設例以儆效尤，庶可使日人不再違令隱匿。　盟軍總部之官員亦謂：日人隱匿之刧掠品尙有數十億美元之鉅，已經繳付者爲數微乎其微。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>朝鮮局勢的新發展</h3>
<p>朝鮮問題在莫斯科外長會議召開的前夕，曾爲世人所注意。其時關於朝鮮局勢的消息，散布於世界各處的新聞紙。駐南韓美軍司令霍奇將軍的回國，及其所發表的談話，旣曾引起各方面的注意，又有朝鮮革命領袖李承晚博士的訪問中美，同時關於美國將如何支持南韓的消息，復騰載各報；所以一時世界目光又多少集中於三韓半島。在莫斯科外長會議召開之際，一般的推測，以爲馬歇爾將軍必將提出關於朝鮮局勢的問題。世人對於朝鮮局勢的發展，莫不寄予殷切的期望；良以朝鮮局勢的如何發展，正可以測探美蘇關係的將如何發展；而美蘇關係的能否融洽，又是世界和平能否維繫的關鍵，所以當馬歇爾將軍在會議進行之際，提出了關於朝鮮局勢的提案以後，無論它的措詞如何嚴厲，世人並不曾感到奇異：因爲他們都有一種預感，以爲這是文中應有之筆。世人所關心的，倒是蘇聯的回答。如今蘇聯外長莫洛托夫已函復美國務卿，表示願意接受美國的建議，重開在朝鮮的聯合委員會，確立朝鮮民主統一的基礎。此一消息的傳來，彷彿令世人對於朝鮮局勢的發展產生一種新希望；一若今後關於朝鮮的局勢，蘇聯已向美國低頭，此後朝鮮局勢的發展，必能趨於單純。</p>
<p>我們於此首先要指出的，就是若果有人以爲蘇聯已接受美國對朝鮮的建議，從此朝鮮的局勢可以穩定下來，因而可能獲致朝鮮的統一民主的話，這似乎是一種幻覺。莫洛托夫答覆美國務卿的原文，我們沒有機會可以讀到；究竟覆文的措詞如何，我們無從臆測。據報載的消息，莫洛托夫的覆文，同意在朝鮮臨時政府中應由一切民主政黨滲加，內稱：『就余之了解，閣下之建議，乃欲在聯合委員會恢復前，確立與朝鮮各民主政黨及社會團體談判之條件，此問題亦爲朝鮮美蘇司令間討論之主題，而兩者之意見，已相當接近。』截止撰稿時止，我們還不曾看到美國政府對於蘇聯覆文所抱的態度，所以美國官方的意向如何，我們亦無從推論。但據新聞社從美京傳來的消息，則謂美政府擬修正對於朝鮮經濟援助的方案，如果統一的談判成功，擬將經濟援助方案，包括朝鮮南北兩部；且謂蘇聯之接受美國建議，表示社魯門主義的心理勝利。從而可知，蘇聯覆文的提出，已在美國起了相當作用。</p>
<p>朝鮮局勢之發展到現階段，問題不完全在北緯卅八度這一條鴻溝。就組成朝鮮統一政權的觀點論，這裏有牽涉到莫斯科三强外長會議所作有關朝鮮托管的決議，和朝鮮各政團對莫斯科托管決定所抱的態度。從朝鮮人民的立塲，反對托管決議是可以諒解的。日本軍閥在朝鮮的統治，始終未能消除朝鮮人民的民族意識：如今日本軍閥崩潰，正是朝鮮民族復蘇之機。他們望治心切，對於托管的決議，自然有難以接受的心情。然而托管決議，彷彿又是一種國際協定：北韓一部人民及多少爲蘇聯御用的政團於是以托管決議爲一種政治資本，以排斥異己。朝鮮局勢的未能融洽，蘇美的對峙，和托管問題都起着作用。欲使一個統一的朝鮮出現，必先對於托治問題有一種默契，然後纔能謀美蘇的協調，如果協調是可能的話。必須在這前提下，朝鮮局勢纔有明朗的希望和可能。</p>
<p>據報傳消息，蘇聯的接受美國建議是在這一個諒解下：就是朝鮮各政團以後不得再有反抗托管決議的表示和行爲。如果所傳不虛，則蘇聯的接受美建議，似乎不能完全認爲蘇聯向美國的低頭；反之，此一諒解的提出，正足以表示蘇聯的勝利。與蘇聯聲氣相通的政團本不曾反對托管，蘇聯一方面接受美建議，一方面又藉此壓迫朝鮮政團不再反對托管，這是蘇聯的勝利。其次，美國來的報道，以爲蘇聯的接受美建議，表示北韓的經濟局勢日趨惡劣，不得不希望接受美國的經濟援助；這又是蘇聯的勝利。蘇聯的覆文一出，就能够引起這樣的心理作用；可見已引起相當效果。我們於此要指出的，就是自杜魯門主義宣佈以來，美國對蘇聯的態度旣轉趨强硬；於是蘇聯在若干地方不得不也以一種新的策略來對付美國。在不放棄它堅持的原則下，蘇聯可以採取一種比較柔和的政策。這對於它本身無損，且更進而可獲得一部人的同情。在對於朝鮮問題，蘇聯似乎就採取了這一種政策。我們現在所要看的就是這聯合委員會的重行召開，究竟能有什麽效果：如果有所決議，這些決議究竟是否能忠實履行。這纔是最大的考騐。</p>
<p>我們於此又有一點不能不提出的，就是關於朝鮮問題，最初見於開羅會議；而開羅會議的參加者，却僅有中美英三强。因此，關於朝鮮局勢的發展，中國特別寄予股切的關注。當本年三月，四强外長會議召開於莫斯科之際，我政府又揭示了對於朝鮮問題的態度，「認爲韓國政府之成立與工作之開展，不容再使延宕」。這是在這個意義下，我們歡迎莫洛托夫最近致美國政府關於朝鮮問題的覆牒；無疑地，無論將來聯合委員會的效果如何，蘇聯此舉，對於韓國政府之成立與工作之開展，必有裨益。我們願朝鮮的民主統一，從此可期；在不久的將來，朝鮮人民能够發揮出他們固有的光輝‘</p>

<h3>育才的意義　昨在上海市立育才中學週會演講</h3>
<p>— 潘公展先生演講　唐佩弦周韻笙紀錄</p>
<p>諸位同學：今天袁校長呌我到貴校來講幾句話，所以我乘機講一些關於「育才」兩宇的意義。</p>
<p>貴校的歷史是十分悠久的，以前是工部局所設立，勝利後，由市政府接管，希望貴校能爲地方，國家，培植良好的人才。貴校校名亦爲「育才」至於如何育？何謂才？這是我今天所要講的。諸位來校讀書，由小學升入中學，由中學升入大學畢業，都希望將來能爲國家發揮才能。至於如何發揮各人的才能，當視各人在學校受敎育的情形而定，尤其是在這中學的階段中。因爲中學是每一個人由幼年到壯年的變化最多，把握亦最難的一個過程，所以敎育在這階段中應該特別重視的，各師長，家長，及諸位自己，均應特別注意。</p>
<p>講到育才的方法很多，不是在短時間裏所能說完的，各位敎師們在平時也一定講到的，我現在把它扼要地講一下：</p>
<p>國父曾經說過：「要使中國富强康樂，必先做到人盡其才，地盡其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流四點。」根據此說，吾人進一步想一想，這四點中，當以第一點爲最要，譬如要做到「地盡其用」這一點，最重要還是在於人才之能否任使得當。我國地大物博，世界著名，但是如果國人都沒有知識技能，如何能使地盡其利？至於「物盡其用」，首先亦要有人會利用它，如果人沒有才能，則物博也根本沒有用，因爲使用不得其當的緣故。試看目今他國非但「物盡其用」，而且連廢物也能利用，但我國却連「可用的物資」也不會利用。所以抗戰時，主席曾說：「一人當作二人用，一錢當作二錢用，一物當作二物（甚至三物四物）用，才能渡過難關。」講到「貨暢其流」，要是沒有人才去開發，交通運輸就不便，再加上處處遇到他人的破壞，這樣，交通運輸如何會便利？貨物如何能暢其流呢？總之，人才是第一要盡其用。</p>
<p>國父在滿淸末年，上李鴻章書中，曾經有講到關於「育才」的三個步驟；（一）敎養有道，（二）鼓勵以方，（三）任使得法。這三個步驟，當同時並進，則一國之中，人人有才，都可以利用，雖然才有大小，但亦當盡其用。我現在先講第一步驟：如果學生在學校中所受到的教育不好，則許多的人才都在學校中被葬送了，而害了我們的國家，害了我們的社會。所以學生都應有「自尊」「自覺」的信念。我最不贊成人家說：「現在（或某時代）沒有人才」，這話是萬萬要不得的。我以爲隨時隨地都有人才，人才祗要我們去掘發，去培植，去使用。例如在中國史上，唐太宗（李世民）在朝的時候，人才濟濟，但是我們應當知道這些一人才並不是有了唐朝才產生的，而都是隋朝的舊臣，爲什麼他們在隋朝的時候不把隋朝建設强盛呢？爲什麼在唐朝就能表現出他們的才能呢？這是因爲隋朝不善用人才的緣故。所以人祗要有才，就不會永久被埋沒，總有一天會出頭，會表現出來，祗要任使得法，則隨時隨地就有「人才」。國父又說：「質有愚智，非學無以別其才；才有全偏，非學無以成其用。」一人的天資有智有愚，但是沒有「育」不能發揮其資能。「才」的大小無關，而在其能否善用其才。「才」有「全才」「偏才」之分。「全才」者，廣博之才能也。「偏和」者，研究偏於一方也。或者說「全才」即「通才」，「偏才」即「專家」，「通才」和「專家」各有其用。但一通才」不能當作「專家」用，「專家」也不能當作「通才」用。醫如一個學生具有學「數學」的才能，倘若他的家長硬要他學「文學」，便是任使不得其法，前面我所說的「敎導無方，葬送了人才」，也是根據這一點的。</p>
<p>學生的成就，一小半是靠教師，而一大半是靠自己，除了自己努力外，尙應有良師益友。諸位在這優良的環境中，如能自強不息，便都是將來的人才。才也許有大有小，但祗要將我的「才能」儘量獻給大衆，社會，國家，便算是盡了自己的責任。所以每一個學生萬萬不可以有「自暴自棄」的思想，就是不能以爲自己的才能小，資質愚，而「自甘墮落」，否則雖有良師敎導，家長培植，也是無用的。</p>
<p>最後，我要跟諸位講的，就是我們學生除了要學習書本上的一切知識技術外，還應當注重道德的修養，以如何在世界上做一個人，換言之，我們不能離開了「德」而祗講「才」，如果我們祗有「才」而沒有「德」，那就等於沒有「才」。所以我們有了「才」，還須有「德」，因此，一個人要成就他的「才」，必須看他有沒有一德」。古人有云：「成德達才」，若將「成德」「達才」兩事合起來，便成爲「育才」。各位將來都有發揮你們的「才能」的時候，希望你們各自努力學習，「德」「才」並進，完成大才。（時間倉卒，本文未及呈潘公展先生修正，如有錯誤，由紀錄者負責）</p>

<p>收後喊價先低後高，最後約五一五〇元。較上週六計美亞跌停，永紗停後微回，軋低一成，信和跌一成强，新光有二〇四號獨力支撑而僅微挫，景福亦然，勤興跌半成强，新華跌一成弱，永公亦跌一成。遞交計美亞跌停，永紗停後有回，跌一成不到。信和亦然，永公勤興跌半成，新光景福微降，冷股計大通火柴中絲跌停後有回，各跌一成左右。新距商務跌半成强，水泥跌一成。景綸微挫。</p>
<p>午後銀根更緊，二〇七號首先力售，遞永紗開出即吿跌停。一二九號亦賣，遞永紗乃低至四八五〇元。此時美亞火柴永公大通中紡中絲紛紛跌停矣。一四三號一五二號趨低補進，升爲四九五〇元。商務統益信和亦吿跌停。二二四號七七號九九號一六號一五四號二〇七號再賣，而破四八〇〇元。新亞榮鹽亦停，新光景福勤興亦吿迫停。二三五號一四號一六〇號脫手，遞永紗乃跌至四六五〇元內。臨收在四六七〇元左右掙扎。收後四號等仍賣，復吿下游。工潮忽吿嚴重，人心仍怯，結果較上週六計永紗永公美亞信和跌停，新華新光景福勤興各跌成半不到。遞交計永紗信和美亞永公跌停。新光景福勤興谷跌成半弱。冷股計榮豐中紡統益大通中絲火柴新亞商務跌至停限，景綸水泥跌成半弱，塲外各股一致慘跌，有供而無求。永紗套利，昨午後一二〇元有四七號農民貼進，不過二角七分左右。聞塲外對敲號家息價有開高至五角以上者。</p>
<h3>外股齊跌</h3>
<p>外股昨以港申電回升至十九元外，怡紗上塲即跌至五九〇〇〇元，證劵帮及錢兌業俱加了結。中途雖因申電回縮而稍回，但午後仍隨大勢而再跌。低價達五一五〇〇元而後稍定。廣帮及洋行帮稍有吸收，結果較上週六計怡紗英聯航業鋼業各跌二成半，業廣墾植開平各跌二成，餘股均跌一成至一成半。</p>
<h3>統債趨疲</h3>
<p>公債昨亦受銀根影響而趨痰，統丙晨開一四二〇〇元，高價一四五〇〇元，三六〇室五〇三室俱售，逐步降落至一一二〇〇元。午刻在一二〇〇〇元外徘徊，結果較上週六計甲乙降一千五，丙跌二千四，丁降「千七，戊降一千四，成交約五六百萬。</p>
<h3>各地銀樓業代表　定期赴首都請願</h3>

<h3>紡管會通過兩要案　去年存棉所紡之紗　不再收購其半數　二十雪標準紗新議價　每件定五百四十萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會第卅三次例會，於昨日下午三時卅分，在市府舉行。到吳兼主委，李副主委，委員吳味經王啓宇，榮鴻元，唐星海，及該會劉文騰，王子建等，討論至五時許散會，通過重要議案二起，茲探誌如次：</p>
<p>（一）去年十二月底存棉所紡製之棉紗，各紗廠以目前幣値貶跌，棉花價格激漲，政府所定之收購價，不敷再生產成本。且各紗廠存棉愈多，所能核配之外棉亦愈少。且政府收購去年十二月底存棉所紡製之棉紗，亦僅限於上海區各紗廠，似欠公允。經吳兼主委提出全國物價委會討論，業經通過，自本年四月份起，該項棉紗，即准免再收購其半數。惟行總棉花及核配外棉所紡製之棉紗，則不在此限。昨日當提出會議席上通過施行。（二）棉紗新議價亦經全國物價委會通適，以廿支標準紗爲準，每件五百四十萬元，自今日起施行。惟廿支紗收購價，每件仍暫照四百六十萬元之舊價。（新議價所採棉花成本，按行總棉花七十五萬元，及棉花市價一百八十萬元扯算。惟扯算之百分比，與民營紗廠所計算者稍有不同。昨日亦經提出通過施行</p>
<p>〔又訊〕紗布轉口申請審核辦法，前由該會擬就呈送經濟部核定。刻經部已有批示到會，今日可望發表云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕該會辦理紗布　往河北東北地區各口岸串請登記事宜，昨已屆截止之期。已領登記表之廠商，共達六六七家。惟昨日前往領表及送表者，紛至沓來，故該會特將收表期限，展延至今日戲止。過此即將進行審核手續，約一週可吿竟事云。</p>
<h3>紡建設法防止　轉售「准購單」</h3>
<p>最近物價波動聲中，紗布市價劇烈上漲，高出當局配貨價格甚鉅。如獲得配給紗布，一轉手間，即可盈利倍餘，近更發現一部份廠商，竟將獲得紡建公司配貨之「准購單」直接轉讓出售，以圖厚利，此種行爲，實已違背當局配給之意旨。茲悉中紡公可爲防止轉瞥「准購單」起見，特於昨（十二）日起，規定加蓋印鑑防止辦法四項，（一）各客戶每日上午投遞請購單時，應在准購單上加蓋同樣之印　，漏則剔除作廢。（二）交付貨款之銀行錢莊本票，其背書應蓋用相同之印鑑。（三）提貨棧單之背面，應亦須蓋用相同之印鑑。（四）凡准購單及交款本票提貨棧單所蓋印鑑，如有不符，即拒絕收款或提貨，並停止配售。昨日起廠商所用請購單，已由公司規定換用新單，舊單一律無效。並依照公布加蓋印鑑辦法加蓋印章，預料轉售「准購單」之惡風，當能逐漸歛跡。</p>
<h3>信用證及輸入許可證　輸管會簡化展期事項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨以第九十八號通函，分發各指定銀行，略稱：爲簡化信用證及輸入許可證之展期事項，茲經輸管會執委會核定下列辦法：</p>
<p>一·凡信用證在三十五年十一月十七日以後開出者，指定銀行得根據該項輸入許可證上所載進口有效期限，予以延展。該項展期，指定銀行應於每週列報中央銀行，及核准上項展期之輸管會關係部份。</p>
<p>二·輸入許可證之展期，仍須由轍管會審核。申請人應逕函該會，核准外匯申請書之有關部份核辦之。</p>
<p>三·凡信用證在三十五年十一月十七日以前開出，並已向指定銀行全數結匯，而展期申請書係於信用證到期後一個月內呈核者，該項展期事宜，概中非限額進口審核處辦理。上述三十五年十一月十七日以前開出之信用證，其延展期限，至多不得遲於本年六月三十日。</p>
<p>該行第九十七號通函內述有關各節應予廢除。</p>
<h3>社局停止市塲拋售　配米辦法經決定　以教職員廠工貧民爲對象</h3>
<p>關於本市民食問題，昨吳市長曾發表談話稱：公敎人員及各校住讀學生，均由市府直接配給食米，貧民方面由政府另設配售處，計口配售，並稱詳細辦法，社會局吳局畏尙留京續商，返滬後即可籌備實施云云。</p>
<p>茲悉，吳局長業於前日夜車回滬，記者特於昨日前往訪晤，承吿：配米辦法大致巳經議定，實施手續尙待會商決定，將來：（一）國立大學之寄宿生，私立大學之敎職員及寄宿生，（二）市立中學之寄宿生，私立中學之敎職員及寄宿生，（三）私立小學之敎職員，（四）各工廠職工，均將予以配售，每人每月以二斗爲限，各校各廠，先將名册送局核定，即行照配。惟私立各校以曾經立案者爲限，各工廠以曾經經濟部立案，須有部照或社會局收據者爲限。</p>
<p>其貧民方面仿照平糶辦法，先請各區公所商定辦法，從調査入手，侯名册齊全，再行分區配售，將來可能搭售麵粉，以資調劑，一切實施辦法，現正在　　中。一俟與有關各機關商定後，即可實施。</p>
<p>記者復詢以貧民標準如何，及配售數量若干。吳氏謂，貧民標準先由棚戶着手，其配售數量已略變更，經與糧食部會商每人每月配給一斗，幼意五升，至各區公賣處地址，擬即在去年社會局配售平價麵粉之原址分設，委託商人代辦，並補助代辦商人手續費。配米辦法由區公所發給購米證，向公賣處憑證購買。關於學校工廠等請配售食米之名册格式，據吳氏云，社會局即將規定統一格式公布，其內容極爲簡單，僅須列姓名籍貫職務身份證號碼住址等項即可。又社會局每日向市塲拋售之食米九千包，業於昨日起停止云。</p>
<h3>絲綢市况回疲</h3>
<p>人造絲配售在即，雖傳說售價提高至九百八十萬元，然與黑市相較，距離尙巨，故昨市一二〇號高山有光，開盤即小，上午盤旋在一千六百二三十萬元之間，收盤爲六百二十萬。下午人心更虛，且同行因軋銀根關係，最後退做五百八十萬元。比上週末跌落一百五十萬元之巨。七五號半光因貨缺喊價只小一百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市亦疲，做開只C字等級一千八百五十萬元七天期票，高級另担價做一千七百六十萬元，比上週末均小五十萬元，餘乏成交，只有喊價。</p>
<p>綢貨交易寂寥，被面上午喊價照舊，然無成交，格子壁縐二萬九千六百元有交易，盛貨產地報小，冲電力紡生坯二十五萬元，故申市昨日掛牌亦短三萬元。</p>
<h3>香港限制外貨進口　但有復興香港效用者不在此限</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港十二日電〕政府最近修正核給美匯及菲匯之辦法後，香港與美國加拿大菲列賓等美元團之貿易，勢將再受打擊。港政府同時並以閒接之方式，知照進口商，對於非主要商品進口之聲請，當不予受理。一九四七年六月二十一十二月間港政府所擬核給之美菲加外匯數量，約與去年同期相同。港政府當先期知照聲請之進口商，可望請得幾許外匯，以便按額接洽定貨。進口商於聲請外匯之際，應向供應部陳報進口物之數量及所需之美元，彼等在戰前任何一年中輸入此等物品之數量及價値，所已洽定之美國或加拿大代辦商名單，若係戰後在港新設之商行，並應陳明登記日期，資本數額及代辦商名單。細察可望核給美匯之進口物名單，僅純粹奢侈品未列在內，如玻璃絲襪，自來水筆等。政府表示希望能增加此項名單所列之項目，使包括香港自需之若干其他物品在內。但同時表示進口商不能提出需要輸入此等商品之堅强理由者，幸勿聲請。可望核給美匯之進口物名單，依其對於復興香港之效能，別爲兩類。甲類：建築材料，木材，衛生設備，機械引擎，機械工具，錫片，電綫，鋼鐵，鋼管，汽車零件，車胎，（新製）冷藏冰籍，電扇，礦油，蠟及石油產品，菜油脂肪，綫衣橡，寫字間機件及用具，打字機，計算機，收賬機，文件箱，戲料及染料，工業及製就化學品，製就菸葉，藥品及盥洗室用品，剃刀刀片，紙張，墨水，書籍雜誌，攝影膠片，電影片及租用之電影片，匹頭，製就衣服，各項植物油，糧食，鮮菓，罐頭水菓，乾某。乙類：汽車卡車，無綫電，菸軍，紙烟，烟斗，錶，咖啡，飲料（啤酒）。</p>
<p>政府之新制度，雖限制核給美匯之進口物種類，然若干商人則認在美匯缺乏之情形下，此實必要之舉。而美匯之缺乏，一部份皆因出口商不願將美匯售與政府而在黑市授受之故。美鈔或紐約匯票之出口，雖屬禁止，然漏洞仍多。例如美鈔或匯票雖不能經由郵遞出口，然政府並無檢査郵件之權。故私寄者殊無法予以制止。觀察家預料新辦法頒布後，美元需要較少，侈奢品之市價則勢將上漲。</p>
<h3>麵粉配價調整</h3>
<p>本粉售價七萬八千元</p>
<p>本市各麵粉廠以目前配售粉價不數成本過鉅，實不勝賠累，請求調整配價，麵粉商亦以各項費用均告上漲，對於經售利潤等亦請予以調整。茲悉配售麵粉價格及經售價格，業經吳市長核准，大致如下：</p>
<p>（一）五十磅洋粉配價七萬五千五百元，利潤四千元，車費下力八百元，售價八萬零三百元。（二）七十磅洋粉配價十萬五千七百元，利潤六千元，車費下力一千二百元，售價十一萬二千九百元。（三）百磅洋粉配價十五萬一千元，利潤八千元，車費下力一千六百元，售價十六萬〇六百元。（四）本粉配價七萬二千元，利潤四千元，車費下力七百八十元，出廠稅一千元，印花稅二百二十元，售價七萬八千元。</p>
<h3>茶市沉靜如故</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市：過程依然冷淡，綠因買戶態度觀望，人心亦仍衰軟。至於各式內銷茶，進出猶相若，市勢平穩如故。茲悉目前各產區之新茶，均在努力生產中，但終以開價奇昂，求者裏足，市面異常岑靜。又悉珠蘭茶及徽州烘靑，天津帮咸抱來者不拒之勢，惜市存涸薄，卒難如願，默察脚地，殊形穩定。</p>
<h3>貫澈扶助工商業目的　貼放利率決不提高</h3>
<p>中央銀行爲加强與商業行莊聯繫合作，協助生產事業，鼓勵日用必需品，及出口物資流通，特設貼放委員會，辦理商業行莊，申請重貼現，轉質押及轉押匯案件。貼放辦法，正積極推進中。各商業行莊，多以國行所訂利率過低，不敷開支，盼望提高。據國行負責人表示：貼放辦法，旨在抉持生產事業及物資之出口，以减輕廠商及出口商之負祖，而達到减低成本之目的，故不能不予低利之貸助。如提高是項利率一，則失舉辦初意，反增加廠商及出口商之負担，重遭高利貸之壓迫，實無提高利率之理由。再商業行莊，本身僅放二成，而重貼現轉抵押轉押匯之利息，照原利率二分之一計算，其所得利息，已屬可觀，不致不敷各行莊之開支。關於申請手續麻煩一點，該負責人謂，如有利於貸款者，無不力求改進，申請以後，即開會審核放款，以我國情形而論，實一屬簡便已極云。</p>
<h3>警局經濟科　吊查五糖商帳册　台糖負責人談配糖實情</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警局經濟科近據報吿謂有若干糖商，因與台糖公司有關，致每期配售量較普通糖商爲多，且一部份有轉輾流入黑市之嫌疑。當經會同市政府調査處派員調査，並將該公司每次配售數量最多之永和（四川南路興業里一號），茂泰恒（十六舖中國通商銀行大樓四號），謙益（鉅鹿路一七二號），中益（楓涇路十九號）中興（新永安街A五號）等五家帳册先行吊査，聞其中永和一家每次配售量爲八一〇包餘則照此數酌予遞减云。</p>
<p>又訊：台糖公司某負責人，昨爲該公司本年度配糖實情，對記者發表談話如次：渠略稱，本公司本年一月份起，迄目前爲止，已配糖共十四期。第五期起，金融波動，物價激漲，糖市亦吿波動，一期之申請量，即達十三萬八千包。第八期糖價又起波動，乃復根據第五六七各期平均配售量照配。第九期至十三期，均照第八期辦法配售。</p>
<p>最近第十四期恢復配售，各糖商申請量總額達十七萬五千包，打破以往申請量紀錄，數額之鉅，使本公司無法照配。乃按第一期至十三期之配售量，加第十四期之申請量，再除以十四，按所得之平均數酌配合糖商。而本期中最高配售額，即爲五百包。即其平均應得之配售量超過五百包者，亦祗能配給五百包，以示限制。本公司迭次配糖數量，及領配之糖商均有詳細帳目可稽云。</p>
<h3>糖價回軟</h3>
<p>昨糖市以配售之貨，今日可出，而銀根緊迫，故趨勢回軟。秘魯細砂初爲四十二萬五千元，後爲四十一萬八千元，降二萬餘元，二四粗白四十五萬元，降二三萬元，二〇中砂四十二萬元，小一萬五千元，汕提靑廿七萬五千元，小五千元，順德靑廿六萬五千元，無上落。刁靑呌原價，未成交。興化白四十「萬五千元至四十萬〇五千元，小萬元。興赤三十一萬元至三十萬元，無軒輊。</p>

<h3>蘇北運堤在重建中</h3>
<p>— 鎭江七日快訊　本報記者和香林</p>
<p>蘇北，這一片廣大的平原上，到今天誰也不相信，還是那麽複雜，每一個角落裏，仍潛在着許許多多的災與難，貧困，流離失所，田圍荒蕪的一輻慘景，尤其最近在共產黨激烈的破壞與竄擾以後。</p>
<p>蘇寗分署爲了配合這方面的工作，撥了九千一百噸麵粉由中央撥發三十四億現金，以工賑的方式，來修築蘇北的運河工程，這是蘇北人民的生命綫，八百萬人的生命財產的寄托。</p>
<p>現在，江北運河及沂九河善後救濟堵口復堤的工作，已完成了三分之一，該署特招待鎭江及上海的記者團去參觀。</p>
<p>八百萬人　生命綫</p>
<p>五月一日，乘專輪入瓜州口，兩岸石版護岸在望，不過，這裏是次要的工程，然而，由瓜州至楊子橋兩岸共計十八里，所修石方有一萬六千餘公方，在涵洞口，有一輛輛戽水車已在戽水。</p>
<p>裏遝河最主要的工程，在邵伯至淮陰，當時因天雨路濕，不能成行，遂止於揚州，在未實地視察以前，由河工當局將運河的狀况及其全部工程，作一個概括的報吿。</p>
<p>蘇北唯一的自然災難—運河的決堤，它的病源，乃由於黄河的變遷，歷史上，黄河的變道大徙有六次，當公元一四九五年，黄河於武陽等縣決口，經徐州由運河奪淮入海，這是第五次大徙，及至第六次大徙，淸咸豐五年，於銅瓦廂決口，奪大淸河入渤海，於是廢道爲其所帶泥沙淤塞，致淮水入海道湮沒，因此，淮水全部悉注洪澤湖，再由寳應高郵，邵伯等湖分洩運河，轉輸入江，然而湖水高於運河，因之只有依賴東西兩岸的屛障，如果一至秋汎，堤防失愼，則有崩潰之處，同時，淮水出洪湖最大總流量爲每秒一萬五千立方公尺而歸江各壩最大總流量爲每秒八千三百三十三立方公尺，舊海各壩最大總流量爲每秒四千六百三十三立方公尺，合計僅及洪湖出口之百分之八十强，因之，運河之患，在於淮水，根治之法在於導淮，然而導淮的工程，相當艱巨，何時可完成，尙難斷定，因之運河兩岸的堤防仍是八百萬人生命財產的生命綫了。</p>
<p>本省境內的運河，自蘇魯交界的黄林莊起，至淮陰縣之楊莊止，爲中運河，計長三百四十四華里，自淮陰縣南至江都縣之瓜洲止，計長三百四十里，是爲裏運河，中運河之害，在魯省南下之沂沭泗堵水，裏運河之害，在由豫皖兩省，西下之淮水，沂，沭，泗，諸水盛漲，則中運河堤漫決，而邵縣，宿遷，泗陽，沭陽，漣水，灌雲，東海等縣成災，淮水盛漲，設裏運河堤一有不守，則淮安，寳應，高郵，江都，興化，東台，鹽城，泰縣，阜寗等縣，淪爲澤國，且阻阨沂泗之下洩，徐海各縣亦受沉災，民國二十年江北大水的慘劇，運河東堤自高郵縣至江都縣之邵伯鎭止，南北六十里間，運河東西堤決口之大者二十六處，水如銀河倒瀉，屯瀦於運東興化，高郵，東台，泰縣，寳應，江都，鹽城，淮安，阜寗各縣者，面積達五萬方里，平地水之深者丈餘，淺亦六七尺，死亡人歡約萬人，物產損失，乃在當時國幣二億元以上，統計中遝裏運大小決口二百十二處，口門之共寬五千六百三十二丈七尺，善後復堤三口工程費耗至三百餘萬元，而工賑部份之麵粉價値尙未併計，而沂沭河之決口數量及堵口工款，亦未併計，可謂黄河北徙以後，江北之全面浩刦。</p>
<p>二十六年抗戰開始，淮水雖年有漲汎，幸未讓成大患，而沂沭河尾閭區域，因堤防朱固，每屆汎期，一這上游來水，即泛濫成災，去歲夏季尤其大小決口五十餘處，民田淹沒數千萬畝，中央曁蘇省府即擬着手興辦運河復堤工程，惟自邵伯以上，尙在中共盤踞區內，雖經聯合國救濟總署，及有關水利機關地方士紳等代表，不避艱險，與中共方面反復磋商復堤工程進行方法，終以成見過深，未獲結果，迨至去秋十月國軍向北推進，高寳兩淮相繼收復後，運河復堤工程遂即開始，規劃興辦，由行政院水利委員會，就聯總所撥賑糧分配麵粉，交由導淮委員會商准江蘇省政府，資成江北運河工程局辦理，並由中央核定加撥工款，分期配發運用，惟在軍事初定時期，地方秩序未全恢復，工程推進，頗非容易，經多方籌劃，排除障碍，運堤至本年一月三十日方始正式開工，沂沭河堤工於本年三月二十四日興工，計自開工之“起至本年四月底止，平均每日工作人數，約二萬五千名，完成土方一百十一餘萬公方。在此工作進行期間，寳應，淮陰之間，常有共黨份子，製造流言，翼圖阻撓，甚且威骨民伕，阻止上工，應付稍一不當，不獨工夫易於離散，即在工人員，應時亦有不測之禍，在本年二月淮安縣南平橋鎭達池鄕第一保保長張學禮，戶長劉學保，因勸說工伕上工，即被共軍槍殺，可是，這是他們的生命綫，他們怎能不做工呢？還有軍隊，駐守地點，大多在城鎭，鄉區一至夜間，即有共軍殘部出沒，駐工人員，夜間均不敢安眠，每有聞警一夕數次走避情形，我們姑不管什麽黨，什麼主義，要爭取民衆，就要安定民衆，這種沒有價値的破壞與騷擾，老百姓只有病惡如仇了。</p>
<p>淮陰以上，沿運一帶，情况尤劣，即以工糧運輸而論，非用汽車裝運，否則即有被刦之虞，沂沭河區方面工糧，現由徐州經隴海路東段運至附近車站已有四百餘噸，可是。因爲運輸的困難，僅六百袋運達目的地，故欲配合工作，進行實在不易。</p>
<p>綜上所述，蘇北運河的工程由分署供給物質，由中央供給現金，由導淮委員會運河復堤工程局辦理，工程的分配，前者負修建船閘涵洞等項，後者負實復堤工作，主要目標有三，一爲防洪，二爲航運灌漑，三爲洩水工程，目前已經做到即將完成的只有第一項，全部工程需土方三七〇六一二五公方，石方三七〇四四公方，核定工糧數量八八〇〇公噸，工款二十一億餘元，已完成的土方，在江北運河自淮陰至邵伯段八十萬公方，淮陰至黄林莊十五萬公方，沂沭河方面十五萬公方，至石方已開採的約有一萬三千公方，運到工程地的已有五千八百公方，現在已於邵伯，高郵，寳應三處開工，預定本年六月底可完成。</p>
<p>記者團五月二日抵揚州，原擬下午趕至邵伯，奈天不助美，雨勢連綿，翌晨七時，未及早餐，即行啓程，乘汽車至邵伯，公路兩旁，一望平疇，麥已莠實，奈歷年來的天災人禍，已使一片錦繡江山，　得瘡痍滿目，約一小時許抵邵伯鎭，略進早餐，即至壩上。</p>
<p>邵伯閘上　弔戰塲</p>
<p>先至船閘，參觀它現在已完全失去効用，它也是共軍　亂中的犧牲者。目前船隻航行，需改由船閘上游之西堤缺口，暫以湖面爲航道，原有管理所的一幢樓房，全被炸毁，僅存殘該，其他房屋，亦遭拆除，僅餘瓦　戰壕縱横，慘然横列，殘餘　堡，蕪草叢生，上游左閘門一關，曾中砲彈，左側小門啓閉機之齒輪壳亦被擊破，地軸彎曲，已不能用，搖車箱上彈孔櫐櫐，閘門已不能開啓，上游左岸之鐵蓋，被手溜彈炸壞，殘痕猶在，閘身水上都份大致完好，僅洋灰蓋頂，中有砲彈所處，下游左首門軸附近，鋼筋外露護木全損，亦爲砲彈所擊，尤以活動橋久未使用，現已推動不靈，橋下「邵伯船閘」題字中「閘」字亦爲砲彈擊壞。這個船閘於民國二十五年完成，計耗資七十餘萬，凈寬十公尺，凈長一百公尺，航行水深二。五公尺，足以容納九〇〇噸大船一艘，或四十噸船十艘一次通航，上下游最大水差爲七。七公尺，閘門以鋼製，門牆用鋼筋混凝土建造，閘室兩旁以塊石砌成斜坡，閘底亦用塊石舖砌，這樣偉大的工程，竟被破壞了。</p>
<p>右閘門上之殘破車廂，係敵僞時代重配，閘旁之小平屋兩間亦爲敵僞所建，尙有殘餘存在，這也好像對現實的誠刺，我們參觀這被鹽的船閘，我們還　這　岷人殘殺的新戰塲惟一的思念，共產黨太對不住無辜的老百姓了。</p>
<p>積極工程待開展</p>
<p>運河閘編自民開二十二年開始進行，截至廿五年冬，關於航運工程先後完成的，計有邵伯船閘，高郵船閘，淮陰船閘，劉澗船閘四座，關於排洪部份，計完成楊莊活動壩一座，并將淮陰閘附近之惠濟閘改建爲新式洩水閘，以濟裏運河航運灌溉之用，及至抗戰軍興，蘇北皖北先後淪陷，八年失修之餘，更加以共軍之攻入逐出，横遭破壞，全部不能使用，記者僅參觀了邵伯閘，其破壞情形已甚，據導淮委會運河流城復堤工程局之報吿，其他各閘壩，損壞尤鉅，譬之淮陰船閘，已損失殆盡，目前矗峙於河中者，宛若往前遺留之廢閘而已，不幸被壞什麽時候才能重建呢？導淮委員會復堤工程局，目前僅做了査勘工作，及小型的如涵洞之類的工程，就以査勘工作而言，亦僅能做到水上部份，至沈沉在水中的損壞情形，尙須於各閘壩上下游建築擋水堤，抽水淸淤後方可逐一詳細檢査，某負責人語記者，本年的經費因經濟緊急措施以後，已自二百九十億核减至七十億，本年僅能做到購買材料，閘編的不修復工程在今年似已可能完成了。</p>
<p>由邵伯織續北行，公路即在堤頂之上。沿途有附近村民所組之災工隊，正在挑土夯土，重要工程在加寬堤身，往日堤面寬度僅有三四八尺，現在已增寬至十公尺，從前堤面僅可由一部汽車行駛，現在已修好的地方，來往汽車已可直駛而過，在　潮竄水轉灣近溜之處，僅修土工不足以資穩實，幷增加護堤石工，修復石駁護岸，現在是枯水時期，河水甚淺，二十噸以上船隻已不能通行，尤以馬柵灣至氾水一帶水深僅及三尺，船隻航行至感困離，其原因一面因爲閘塌失修，不能控制水位，同時由於黄泛的影響，河身已漸淤塞，近年來，平均增高六公寸（約合二市尺），因之疏浚工程亦屬刻不容緩。</p>
<p>目前所做的工程僅在復堤，這是消極的防禦工作，至航行灌漑以及洩水工程的積極工作，正待開展，要之，運河復堤工程完成後，決定水不致再行泛濫，使受害農田，均可恢復耕種，避免洪水之地面可達一千八百萬畝，若東西堤涵閘修復完成後，可使裏下河區農田一千一百萬畝之灌漑給水無處匱乏，積潦可由涵閘宣洩，閘壩重建，航行暢達，這是蘇北民衆唯一的要求了。</p>
<h3>台省一葉</h3>
<p>— 嘉義四日航訊　帝冬</p>
<p>台灣本是我國的封疆，古爲東夷地，宋元以後本土來此的人漸多，一八九五年日淸戰後，淪爲日人統治，勝利後始重回祖國懷抱，撫今追昔，不勝感慨。它是一塊面積還不及浙江省四分之一的小島，形狀彷彿一片樹葉，山脈横貫南北爲島的脊梁，西面爲平原，東岸多叢山，最高峯爲南部之新高山，它因得天獨厚，更加上日人五十一年的慘淡經營，在平原有米甘蔗水菓樟腦等產物，在山間則有紅檜等著名木材出產。</p>
<p>交通建設顯著躍進</p>
<p>說到這裏的交通和建設事業，比起國內來着實要進步二十年到三十年，例如從水電道路來講，雖是偏僻的鄕間，却有都市的衛生設備，以及明亮的電燈，以交通言，除了横跨南北，北起基隆南抵恒春的長達四百餘公里；和北段由基隆至蘇澳甫段由花蓮至台東的環島鐵路方便不談外，他如公路的發達就是比起號稱敷設極爲普遍的粵桂兩省亦不遜色，因爲這裏用柏油所砌的甲級公路蜿蜓鄕間，車輛往來如梭，就會令來台人們感到驚奇歡服，他如全省可供使用的飛機塲，日　時代即有七十多處，再就海上　通北有基隆，淡水，南有高雄高平，東部還可建築良港，又何怪日人前此不把台灣當爲進攻南洋及我國本土的唯一基地呢？</p>
<h3>參觀復興磚瓦廠</h3>
<p>— 乃炘</p>
<p>南京爲我舊遊之地，冠蓋京華，府院巨囿，還多係戰前舊觀，鍾山靈谷，風光依然。承復興磚瓦廠經理徐蓮勳先生之邀，參觀該廠全豹，覺得頗足以社會人十介紹，特記之如次：</p>
<p>復興磚瓦廠創辦於民國卅五年四月，迄今不過一年，當時資本二億元，爲合夥性質，設事務所於白下路六號，廠址南京和平門外笆斗　，距市區約十四公里，佔地一百數十餘畝，自建廠房數處於叢山之間。土窰櫛比，已成磚瓦紅灰兩色，漫山遍野，蔚爲奇觀，面臨長江支流，環山憑水，景色幽美，有汽車可直達此間，交通堪稱便利。</p>
<p>多數工人　曾壓戎行</p>
<p>工人數百，大半來自魯豫皖諸省，且曾在抗戰期間上過戰塲，退伍後有家歸不得，改業爲工，且多數係單身漢，也有携眷聚族而居的。膳宿均由廠方供給，一日三餐，終年難得葷菜。當我們參觀各處時，正是午膳時候，三五成羣，席地而坐，白飯大蒜，吃得津津有味。他們除了做工吃睡之外，沒有娛樂消遣，山居終年，不知世事演變。工作全爲包工制，每組有工頭管理，工資待遇，視工作經騐而定，每月自數萬至三四十萬不等，可是並不按月支取，逢三節結算，平時僅支些叧用而已。</p>
<p>一磚一瓦　物力維艱</p>
<p>磚和瓦的製成，經過需時約兩週，先和泥出坯以後，安置在廣大的塲地上待乾，乾後搬放在土窰內，每窰容納磚瓦三四萬，用煤火燒煉達九十六小時之久，晝夜不熄。窰工輪流替値，火熄後過一兩天方可啓窰，成熟即是紅色，如製靑灰色磚瓦，再須澆水一晝夜，製磚瓦之最大成本爲燃料一項。</p>
<p>出品精進　基礎奠定</p>
<p>首都正在復興建設時期，而目前房荒特別嚴重，營造正爲應時之事業，磚瓦爲建築材料所必需，該廠營業發達，當在意料之中。出品供不應求，故該廠特於去年向美國通用公司購置發電機一座，並向上海大華鐵廠定製各種機件，現已裝置工竣，已可大量生產，由手工土製而進入機製之後，出品益爲精進。每月營業蒸蒸日上，今後尙有完善之計劃，筆者在該廠參觀達數小時，深覺該廠創辦不久，而已有如此成績，初步事業基礎，於焉奠定，此固由於人力物力，機運所致，實亦因各部門上下人等均能同心合力，埋頭苦幹耳。</p>

<h3>左拉以後的法國史詩</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>左拉的傑作「盧質馬加爾叢書」以後，法國現今又出現了一部連續性的史詩，這就是羅曼英（Jules　Romains）的「幸運的人」(Menof　Good　Will）。全書十四卷，總目如下：（一）幸運的人，（二）熱情的香客（Pssion's　Pilgrims），（三）驕傲與溫順（The　Proud　and　theMeek），（以上魏爾斯Warre　B.Wells英譯）（四）下層的世界（The　World　from　Below）（五）大地顫抖了（THe　Earth　Trembles），（六）深度與高度（The　Depths　and　the　Heights），（七）一世界之死（Death　of　a　World），（八）凡爾登（Verdun），（九）春風吹又生（Aftermath），（十）新的日子（The　New　Day），（十一）工作與遊戲（Work　and　Play），（十二）風起了（The　Wind　Is　Rising），（十三）熟情的逃避（Escape　in　Passion），（十四）十月七日（The　Seventh　of　Octhober）（以上均何樸金土Gerard　Hopkins譯）。據說這是現代小說中最站得住的作品，綜合法國社會。政治與精神的生活，兼說到歐洲。時間是一九〇八年十月六日到一九三三年十月七日。</p>
<p>羅曼英寫過不少的小說，戲劇，詩歌和散文，不但對於法國有影響，也對於歐美有影響。其中最著名的便是這部偉著「幸運的人」，他與批評家都承認這是他的偉大的作品。他起初意識到要寫這作品，已是三十年前的事。實際上開始寫作是在一九三一年。他說，一切他的作品都只是這紀念碑的作品的預備與練習。他在一九三六年曾訪問美國，一九三九年又去過一次，就住在筆會，發表了他那有名的戰時民主的演說。一九四〇年法國陷落後，羅曼英就住在美國與墨西哥。現在他已經回到法國去了。</p>
<p>如果你分享羅曼英所叙的喧囂而又熱情的生活，你將看見舊世界的破碎和新世界掙扎地生長；您夢想，懷疑而且失望；你隨着作者經歷了許多風浪和危險；，在這一千餘人個別的生活中，你觀察了這時代的驚人的戲劇。這就是巴黎，這就是法國，這就是歐洲，這就是我們的世界，我們的時代。</p>
<p>「沒有一位歷史家寫一九一八年到一九三三年的歷史能寫得這樣深刻的，」傳記家穆魯瓦（AndreMaurois）說，「羅曼英顯得比任何人都好，他寫一小組幸運的人，他們思索了許久，以爲他們能够重建歐洲。」</p>
<p>羅曼英可說是Rebelais派。他的作風是流利的。想像力豐富。他對於人生是抱着藝術家的態度，他在文學上的興趣主要的是美學上的。他是布爾喬亞文化的柱石。他自己以爲他是屬於巴爾扎克和左拉一類的。</p>
<p>這部大著作進行得很慢。許多人物動作很少，只是表示作者對於文學，性與倫理等等的意見。其中兩個主要人物，其實都是羅曼英他自己，一位賈禮士（Pierre　Jallez是內省的，詩的，敏銳的，還有一位賈番尼翁（Jean　Jerphanion）則是客觀的，常態的，懷疑的。他的「凡爾登」是這些小說中最好的一部，例如他寫：一個嬰孩的誕生；一個可憐的孩子打着鐵圈，夢想着生活；巴黎的人們在一個美麗的早晨覺醒過來，雄壯的呼聲反對第一次世界大戰的獸性。</p>
<h3>山城情調</h3>
<p>— 閻哲吾</p>
<p>炒米糖開水</p>
<p>夜，山城馬路縱然冷靜，總有些行人走動。十二點以後，戲院散了塲，觀客到專做夜市的館子裘去「宵」了「夜」，然後回家睡覺，道至少是次晨一時的辰光。二時以後，趕猪的在吆喝着猪羣進入宰坊，霧氣籠罩住街燈，迷濛地只見人影，打更的在敲着竹梆，可是賣「炒米糖開水」的還在街上逛着，拉長着嗓子喊着。賭錢的，抽雅片的，還有窮文化人，有着「夜生活」的人們，皆需要這一方方的炒米糖泡的開水，暖暖地，甜甜地聊解深宵的飢寒；闊一點的，加冲上一兩個鷄蛋，也還可口。因爲夜深了，要買什麼也沒有，所以「炒米糖開水」却成爲唯一的珍品。</p>
<p>夜深沉，天漸亮，三點鐘後，趕輪船的，挑菜的，運貨的，乘午夜人稀路好走，於是搶着工作；在這些勞動者心上，早已有了「日光節約時間」，所以下半夜的「吃市」更多，碼頭上，慣常有着豆漿，油條，撈糟蛋，還有，只從晚六時開張做到天明的「抄手攤子」，他們的生活是「夜當日，日當夜」！</p>
<p>生活像是競逐的船隻，正像嘉陵江水湍湍地流，二十四小時的日夜循環，在競逐生活的人們是每分鐘總要爭取的。自然，這緊張與疲乏的競逐常使人感到重壓下的喘息，不信，聽那夜靜人寂的深巷裏，漫長的呌賣聲—「炒米—糖—開—水」可以體會得到辛酸悲怨的情調。</p>
<p>擺龍門陣</p>
<p>爲什麼「談閑天」名爲一擺龍門陣」？恕我不曾「考源」，但從這句話裏表現着四川人民是多麼喜好悠閑生活。在重慶，可以見到許多的茶館，而到處統是坐滿了人。這些人自然統是爲「擺龍門陣」而來的；初到山城的人們着不慣，生活久了却無人不染上「泡茶館」的習慣，至今回到江南，我們還感到沒有那麽多茶館的不便。</p>
<p>某次，我在山湖，見到一位前進的婦女，在遊行的隊伍裏，大聲地向坐在茶館裏的人們嚷嚷：「醉生夢死的同胞們，日本鬼子要滅亡我們國家啦，別再泡茶館啦！」可是倚在樓邊看遊行的人們淡淡地看着她，大家依舊是吃瓜子，抽葉子菸，看報，談閑話，有的還正在談生意經。</p>
<p>住在川內久了，才知道任何鄕鎮城區統有茶社，並且有種種的作用。</p>
<p>茶館，普通與「袍哥」各堂（仁義禮智信）有關，有管事的，有當家的，每天作爲「兄弟們」聚會，「碰頭」，與談生意之所。有些茶館成為各商業公會聚會打聽行情之處，每逢「趕塲」茶館內的人色暫時有個自然的歸類！因此，茶館的副作用便是爲「趕塲」人們交易與休息而設，所以它與農村社會經濟關係頗大，倒不可輕視他。</p>
<p>泡茶，有大方，龍井，沱茶，菊花，還有所謂「兩開」與「玻璃」。「兩開」者，茶葉與菊花各半，「玻璃」便是「白水」的意思」，那是茶房的好處，老闆不收賬。普通茶是以每小方盒茶葉數量計算碗數的，所以有時伙計便兩盒勻三盒地泡，從中漁利。在重慶，因爲人們生活苦，住房不佳，很多人，尤其文化界的朋友，早上起身而後，即到茶館洗面，泡茶，吃早點，看書，寫稿，一直到中午回機關或家中吃午飯；下午再去。差不多以茶館爲臨時辦公接洽機關及工作地點者比比皆是。不過這種茶館比較高尙，像重慶中山公園內茶館，有賣報的，擦皮鞋的，還有賣自來水筆的，相命拆字的兜售於其間。</p>
<p>坐茶館唯一的誘惑是桌上放的瓜子，吃開了頭，便一盤兩盤地吃了下去，茶房也會一盤接一盤地送上來，因爲這是他的特別好處。</p>
<p>在山城，常常停電，也常常停水，所以茶館常常搶水並加高茶資，夏天，水更寳貴；有時斷水，茶館也關門大吉。</p>
<p>茶館，却是擺龍門陣的好地方，也是最經濟的消遣所在，乍聞乍見，頗不謂然；久而久之，深感茶館的便利。復員了，到了京滬，「戲茶廳」裏一杯茶賣到七八千元，實在令人回想起山城茶館的便宜；想想在山城躺在茶館竹椅上的舒適神態，至今還不禁「心　往之」呢！</p>
<p>酒的情趣</p>
<p>戰時，山城禁酒，菜館不許猜拳喝酒，但居然還是有人以茶碗盛酒，以調羹代杯，勺勺而飲的。「經檢隊」人來，茶碗上加了蓋子放在某一個人的面前便若無其事，不顯痕跡。同時規定酒舖賣冷酒只許賣花生茶乾，不許賣熟菜，於是「冷酒館」盛行一時。川人不喜吃黄酒，一白乾」「大麵」最風行。賣酒認杯計，兩三知己，把杯聊天，一樣地可以喝得醉酊大醉。</p>
<p>除成渝外，四川各縣並不禁酒，主人以「編酒」（用方法勸酒的意思。）爲能事，我們多少人皆曾「被困」。因此，在酒席宴前機靈的絕不開戒，否則偶一「開例」，那麽，集中目標進攻，結果「不醉無歸。」所以川中酒量大者常有「醉七天」「酒　子」「醉不醒」的綽號。</p>
<p>冬，霧氛龍罩着山城，迷濛混沌中的夜景，帶着幾分醉意的眼睛看過去格外地神秘，從前我愛上海霞飛路的街燈，近十年，我却更愛　裏山城的酒氛！</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血507</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>今天這個局面，與以上這幾種情形，毫不相類。來人敲門舉動，雖說那般神秘，比及見了面，看她那樣天眞坦白，却又似乎毫無神秘可言。安知她不是年靑怯怍，不敢放胆？要說她是敵意行動，看她一面孔孩子稚氣，笑嘻嘻地，而且彬彬有禮；一身簡潔的夏天服裝，扎繁着一雙手臂，除非預先看下了一顆定時炸彈之外，連別針都看不見一根，別說手槍，電刀，寳劍，一類的兇器，任是如何，也找不到一絲敵意。</p>
<p>旣不特殊神秘，又無敵意，却是這等突如其來，嘻笑頑皮，同時還是一位女性，所以鶴見一時怔住，打發不開；除了一「哦」，連下文都沒有了。同時，鶴見這一天滿腔困惱焦盧的心境，也是一個把他僵住在這女子而前的最大因素。</p>
<p>「眞的冒味得很，古先！」那女子看見鶴見楞在那裏，便又開口了，而「猪玀米」三字，忽又換成一個「古」字。換了這惻稱呼，表示她的態度，較剛才略加嚴肅，也表示她對於鶴見的以往，十分熟悉：「聽說我有一個哥哥，到這裏來同先生談過話，我這時有一點小事要找他，沒有知道他已經……不知道他……想必他……聽說他……也許還要再來……」</p>
<p>這個脚色簡直在搗亂，不是嗎？頭一點，旣是冒昧闖到向未謀面的人這裏來，照平常道理，就該一口氣說明「我名呌什麽，家兄是誰……」自我介紹一下，也可呌人家明白，究竟是怎麼一回事。第二點，尤其搗亂：她那最後半句話，在出口的時候，一下轉了三四個大灣；一時似乎說她令兄「已經……」大約總是「已經去了；」一時又想說「不知道他……」大約是「不知道他已經走了。」一時又似乎說「想必他……」或許是說「想必他還要再來…………」一時却又說「他也許還要再來……」</p>
<p>雖說她這後半句話，轉了三四道口氣，却明明可以證實這個脚色是個說謊大家；因她前言不對後語；旣說她哥哥「到這裏來……談過話，」聽這口氣，明明已經知這她哥哥已經走了，不走，她這些話又從那裏聽來的？不是嗎？却又來說她「沒有知道他已經走了……」說的時候，覺得這話不妥，所以才速轉三轉口氣。然而從這兩句話裏，却又可證明這脚色，並沒有了不起的說謊天才。因眞正說謊的專家，最大秘訣，須得出言「肯定」：寅是寅，卯是卯，決不能搖搖晃先，讓聽者有半分猶疑才對。</p>
<p>她這們一語三轉，連心思棼亂如如蔴的鶴見，也聽出毛病來了：</p>
<p>「小姐尊姓？……令兄是誰？……」</p>
<p>鶴見這一間，問得極其在理；無論何人何地何時，碰見不認識的人，聽了對方那樣說法，當然有這一問。同時鶴見這一問，當然也是開門見山的公式。照理，鶴見如此的問了，對方就應當把自己姓名，堂堂皇皇的說明，「家兄」是誰，也要還出娘家來，才合情理。您猜對方聽了鶴見這一間之後，她怎樣答覆？</p>
<h3>消極的職業觀</h3>
<p>— 巴里</p>
<p>前些日子筆者寫過一篇「職業心情」的短文，提及今日的一般青年朋友都懷着一份低落的淡泊的心情。這種心情而且隨時日的越趨艱困而更形擴大起來，這是一個戰重的印象</p>
<p>今天，每一個從業者都似乎在懊惱着，懊惱工作的繁重，懊惱學習的不够，更懊惱待遇的菲薄。然而儘等懊惱，還仍舊祗能苦苦地株守下去。因爲工商業凋疲，雜持現狀還不易，寗能擴展，所以旣有裁員之計，復見减薪之說，儘量减少用人，即使用一個人也給你雙倍三倍於前的工作。因此作爲一個從業者，一種對職業的不安與不滿心理就發生了。然而又有什麽辦法呢？於是做一日和尙撞一日鐘，產生了一種得過且過的「混」的觀念。</p>
<p>本來，職業應該是理想與實踐的結合體，獻身這一個職業，就預備在這條路上發展自己，達成自己的理想的。可是時世艱危的今天，職業的尋求並不能隨自己的心意，充分求業也祗是一種說法和理論而已，所以祗能碰碰運氣，有一個機會，抓住一個機會，所謂「一枝之棲」，祗當做噉飯的手段了。</p>
<p>如果僅僅把職業當做噉飯的手段，這，不但消滅了職業的深意，而且也盡失了一份從業的熟忱與情趣了。因之，對職業所抱的觀念十分消極。祗求暫度，無久遠的打算，自然亦無理想可言。而對職業所懷的心情不是厭倦，憎懇，也必是淡然處之，視作鷄筋了。</p>
<p>這種消極的職業觀不但影響從業者生的意志，如果在國家和平建設時，更會影響建設的進程。不過幸而這種觀念產生在不安定的情狀下，如果社會環境能够達到自由擇業與充分求業的階段，這消極的觀念，也許會完全消滅的。可是今天，據中華職業敎育社發表，求業率低至百分之十四，即一百人求業祗有十四人得到事做，這說明了今日求業狀况是如何惡劣了。但是我們仍不能失去希望，眞如得過且過抱着消極觀念的一般從業者一樣，總希望能有和平建設的一天。</p>

<h3>聽敎育部交響樂隊</h3>
<p>— 心亙</p>
<p>敎育部中華交響樂團，最近在南京開始演奏了。他們每星期日在新都戲院主持一個星期音樂會，演奏一些名曲。</p>
<p>這個樂隊是相當整齊的，一共有卅多個樂師，由林聲翕祖任指揮。樂師中有一部份是前中山大學管絃樂隊的隊員，當然能手也是相當多的。</p>
<p>今天是他們春季中第五次的星期音樂會，我去聽了一遍，節目一共有六個，第一個是貝多芬的「普羅修米」序曲，其後有「小步舞」，「匈牙利舞曲第二及第七」和「船歌」等，最後一個是貝多芬的「英雄交響樂」，雖然他們的能力還不足以演奏這些相當繁重的曲子，（尤其是「英雄交嚮樂」）但是他們總算盡了最大的力量了。</p>
<p>「普羅修米」序曲，演奏起來非常嚴肅，最先的幾下短促的重音，立刻提起了聽衆的注意力，使會塲增加了許多莊嚴的氣氛：然後，樂聲漸平，使聽衆們把精神稍爲鬆馳一下，以便繼續聆聽這些美麗的樂章。</p>
<p>『小步舞』是一個輕快的曲子，控制了全塲活潑的空氣，繼而「匈牙利第二無曲」，文　為穩重和有力，然後「第七舞曲」，又回復了輕鬆，空氣總是這樣互相變換。</p>
<p>休息十五分鐘後。開始演奏「壓軸」的「英雄交嚮樂」，（即貝多芬第三交嚮樂）。一共分四個樂童，第一樂章快而輝煌，第二樂章是送葬行列，比較肅穆，第三樂章是諧謔曲，第四樂章則是終曲，在這個交嚮樂裏，樂隊充份地表現了他們的努力；指揮林聲翕是國內有名的音樂家，他的手，他的面部表情，充份地表現了音樂中的喜怒哀樂，使聽衆們深深的感動，等到一曲終了的時候，林氏也如卸重祖似的鬆了一口氣時，已經是滿頭大汗了。</p>
<p>中國唯一的大樂隊，是上海市政府交響樂團，但他們多半是外國樂師，純粹是中國人的樂隊，恐怕只有中華交嚮樂團是首屈一指了，中國的音樂是落後的，我們希望這兩個樂隊永遠的成長下去，努力下去，爲中國的樂壇爭一口氣。</p>
<h3>新聞綱</h3>
<p>— 鐵雲</p>
<p>我們相信米商也確有困難，但決不可以爲了電台廣播，因爲報紙記載，動手便打，也不是米商應採取的方法。假如一切都訴之於「武力」，一切批評與輿論都將銷聲匿跡，聽憑「打風」稱覇。</p>
<p>羣衆果然盲目的，但領導的人要負完全責任。我們不能一切推卸給「羣情激憤」。</p>
<p>平實米潮還在於平穩物價，穩定幣　，物價平，一切均撥刃而解。</p>

<p>新上海從前有過一個很龐大的計劃，並且把上海市政府及各局辦公應都建築在市中心，但現在市中心是够荒凉的了；上海人口密集，爲什麼不把市府遷移到市中心區去呢？</p>
<p>有一晚聽兩個穿制服値班的人在談上海的馬路，他們對於前工部局馬路工程的認眞，備致讚揚；對於現在修補馬路的馬虎，大搖其頭。事實如何我們不知道，但就近說起，馬路盡是傷痕斑斑，高一步低一脚，也是因爲修路的經費不够支出麽？</p>

<h3>「衣錦榮歸」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>「衣錦榮歸」是描寫一個青年敎員林道君在「八一三」抗戰爆發後，毅然決然的離別妻女與友人參加戰地工作，在前綫服務，後來他耐不住戰地的艱苦生活，跑到後方去，在重慶改行做了生意，竟然發了財，變成了亦官亦商的小要人，勝利後，他以接收要員的姿態飛返上海，衣錦榮歸的他，免不了在歌舞塲中找尋一些刺激，結果與他的女兒發生了關係，——他的女兒爲了工廠關門被迫在舞塲裏幹着摟抱生涯，故事的結尾，他的妻子死了，女兒出走，自己在風雪裏受着良心的譴責。這是一個倫理的悲劇，作者着力的鞭策了在抗戰中動搖的知識份子，他更撕去了那些接收要員與亦官亦商者的外衣，把他們內在的醜惡暴露出來，讓人們看看這批衣錦榮歸者如何的無恥與可憐，這是作者對正義的控訴。</p>
<p>但是作者對於林道君道樣一個知識份子，在抗戰期中的動搖只歸咎於他的性格軟弱，不能耐苦而忽略了社會的客觀原因，這是由於作者對現實沒有深切的認識所犯的錯誤。此外小玲與林道君相戀竟未能認出林即伊之父親，而林妻尾隨小玲與道君約會時，在玻璃窗外一見即能認出一別八年之丈夫，何况小玲家中縣有放大之父母照片，在銀幕上林道君八年中並無多大改變，此點極爲不合理。</p>
<p>再說勝利後，多少悲慘離合的題材可寫，而作者偏着眼於父女的戀愛，此種近於變態心理的傾向，正是作者庸俗之處。</p>
<p>演出上，作爲一個新的導演，趙丹是相當的成功了的。他樸索寫實的處理了全劇，沒有庸俗的噱頭，這是難能可貴。缺點只是在塲與塲之間，戲的連接上草率了些，此片如果能够再剪接得緊凑些，是可彌補這個缺點的。　最後林妻死後，女兒也出走了，林道君重臨空屋中受良心譴責的一塲戲，是一條多餘的尾巴，如能删去了，故事結束得更有力，也更乾淨。</p>
<p>顧而已的林道君，後面的戲好於前面，身份氣派均極合適，身體的外型幫助了他，談瑛的徐慧雖極賣力，但無可取之處，化裝方面後來應該更蒼老一點，以符合她那困苦的生活。張雁的三輪車夫，戲極討好，演來只是平平。孫俠的李杰成，尙見穩健，徐佐隻的小玲，表情極爲生硬，也許是初上鏡頭，怯塲的綠故，台詞唸得更壞。值得一提的是那一對小演員業小鏗與于復瑛，尤以前者更有生動自然的演技。</p>
<p>雖然這部片子有着劇本上的缺陷，但整個的演出，仍不失爲一部差强人意的片子，値得介紹給愛護給國產片的觀衆。</p>
<h3>銅鈕扣</h3>
<p>— 洪濤</p>
<p>遜淸官僚，朝服用外套，常服用馬褂，皆對襟銅鈕，累累如櫻桃，今天仍以馬褂爲常禮服，惟鈕扣則田銅鈕子而衍爲花樣繁多之套鈕，第銅鈕子之制，初不知其何自昉也。詢之父老，方知此制始於雍正朝，蓋雍正帝以篡竊得位，猜忌殊甚，時草澤英雄之不忘朱明者，猶有復燃之勢，即帝之親屬，亦皆欲得而甘心，故帝嘗招致技擊者流，日侍左右，以防不測，一日，正朝會時，忽有人自殿角牆上顚踏於地，朝臣皆相顧失色，事後始知是日有刺客伙屋隅正岡狙擊，他人皆未及覺，適爲漢侍御某瞥見，某故以善彈丸名，顧倉卒不及抽矢，又佳御座；突然用武，倘刺客覺而先逸，則無所佐證，且以大不敬得罪，某故摘其馬褂鈕子，擊其雙目，迨刺客負痛而踣，猶握一匕首，瑩然長不及尺許，鋒芒逼人，鞠之自承爲刺客。自是遂以對襟銅鈕定爲侍御常服，久之士大夫亦羣相效尤，相沿成例，不復能知其故事矣。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「侯局長，就是這一輛車工」熊處長笑容可掬地指着這一輛車向那中年人說：「這輛車比較最新。決不會拋錨！哈哈哈！」</p>
<p>「哈哈……！」中年人很不自然地附和着笑。</p>
<p>「怎麽？司機台上已經有人啦！」同行的那個女客老迷已看到這輛車的司機台上有一個胖胖的女人坐着，便沉下了臉，高聲地間。</p>
<p>這顯然是出乎能處畏的意料之外的，他回頭去仔細望了一望，臉色激怒得有些發紅。那瘦長條子的司機實際上也聽到有他們這一批人來了，因此他的臉色也並不比能處長的好看。</p>
<p>「司機！爲什麽讓這個女人坐在這裏？」年少的熊處長搶步上前，威風凛凛地說：一敎她下來！立刻下來！」</p>
<p>瘦長條予的駕駛兵不就說話，他感到有一些躊躇。在車子行動的時候，司機高於一切，這是抗戰幾年來在公路上打出的鐵一般的規律。熊處長是什麼東西？他爲什麽要怕他？然而，現在車子還沒有開，並且他的頂頭上司——輜汽×團第×連的連長——也一起來了。不買這筆賬顯然又不成。</p>
<p>那位劉連長怕事情鬧僵，也走上來了</p>
<p>他很機靈地先向那正在豫疑不定的駕駛兵使了一個眼色，然後高聲地喊：</p>
<p>「鄧國忠，呌那個女人下來！這是×司令介紹的侯局長和侯太太。你這司機台一定得讓下來！聽見沒有？」</p>
<p>瘦長條子的鄧司機聰是那麼大的來頭，不覺軟了一半；然而那個已上車的胖女人是他的主顧，是他的化錢的主顧、又怎　能呌她下車呢？（六）（九）</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Harass Changji and Changshen Railways, Fierce Fighting on Outskirts of Nong'an, Situation in Harahai Under Encirclement Unclear</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changchun, 12th] Communist troops are harassing the vicinity of the Changji and Changshen Railways, attempting to cut off traffic between Changji and Changshen. More than 20 Communist troops sneaked into the vicinity of Huapichang on the Changji Railway, and more than 300 Communist troops were discovered near Tumenling, resulting only in outpost contact.

<h3>National Army Units in Henan Recover Fengqiu and Yanjin, People of Anyang Await Rescue from Dire Straits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 12th] The National Army in eastern Henan won a victory. A detachment of the remnant forces of Jin Shaoshan, a bandit located seven kilometers northeast of Qixian, was surrounded and completely annihilated by the National Army on the 11th, killing more than 1,000 Communist officers, including a regimental commander, and capturing more than 300.</p>

Currently, there are no traces of Communist troops south of Niushitun.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Today, hundreds of thousands of kind-hearted compatriots in Anyang are enduring hunger and fear, hoping that the government will send reinforcements to lift the siege and provide food to save their tragic fate with an urgent feeling that each day feels like a year. There are currently more than 200,000 refugees in the city, and 220,000 refugees outside the city within the three-mile gap leading to the Communist-controlled area. The war has divided them into two groups: refugees inside the city cannot go out, and refugees outside the city cannot enter the city or escape the Communist blockade. Under these circumstances, the food problem for the residents in the city is extremely serious, but there may still be relatives who can share food. Those who are camping out in the open are on the verge of starvation, and stray bullets flying from all directions can cause death at any time. The tragic situation cannot be described in words. The composition of the refugees includes some who are from Anyang, and some who have fled from various counties in southern Hebei and northern Henan, who are also those whom the Communists will not forgive. Apart from looking south and praying for early rescue, they have no other way to survive. As for the civilians outside the city, they are being subjected to two different treatments. The Communists west of the railway, in order to create hatred, ordered each village to deliver a certain number of corpses every day, regardless of whether the dead were male or female, rich or poor, to meet the quota; otherwise, the village chief would be subjected to the cruel torture of "red boiling" or "white boiling." The so-called "red boiling" is to dismember the person's limbs and then boil them to death in a pot. "White boiling" is to slowly boil a living person from the feet to the head until the person dies and the flesh dissolves, leaving only white bones. East of the railway, people are still being extorted for civilian guns. When representatives from Anyang described the situation in Anyang to reporters, they were all in tears and deeply saddened. How to lift the siege of Anyang as soon as possible, and how to transport food before the siege is lifted, has become an extremely urgent matter today.</p>

I will tell you after I ask."</p>
<h3>Strengthen the Rule of Law to Seek Progress and Prosperity, Taiwan Provincial Government Established on Friday, Wei Daoming Arrives in Shanghai Today to Transfer to Taiwan to Take Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] The newly appointed Chairman of Taiwan Province, Wei Daoming, is scheduled to leave Nanjing by plane for Shanghai in the afternoon of the 13th, stay for one day, and fly to Taiwan on the 15th. The Taiwan Provincial Government will be formally established on the 16th. The swearing-in ceremony of Chairman Wei and the person in charge of the oath ceremony have not yet been decided. Wei visited Chief Executive Chen Yi on the 12th to discuss the recent situation in Taiwan Province and Chen's plans and policies for governing Taiwan, in order to understand the actual situation. However, Wei believes that everything can only be comprehensively planned after arriving in Taiwan. He met with reporters at Wang Chonghui's residence and replied to reporters' inquiries: I believe that in order to get politics on track, we must first seek social security and economic stability. My future work will focus on strengthening the rule of law and following the instructions of the central government as a guide. Wei then emphasized several points as follows: (1) The education problem focuses on exchange, that is, transferring professors from the mainland to Taiwan and sending students to the mainland for education, so as to achieve the effect of cultural exchange. (2) From political democratization to economic democratization, so that Taiwan's industry can coordinate with the mainland's industry to harmonize supply and demand. Finally, Wei stated: All those who go with me this time are excellent people and have considerable confidence in governing Taiwan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 12th] The newly appointed Chairman of Taiwan Province, Wei Daoming, said: He does not intend to express any opinions. His visits to the Chairman these days have focused on the need to prosper Taiwan Province. In order to achieve this goal, he is determined to attach importance to stability, and only in stability can progress and prosperity be achieved. He does not intend to change the monetary system in Taiwan Province, and will give economic freedom under the principle of not harming economic stability. In the past, during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, although certain industrial constructions had a considerable foundation, this was nothing more than the way imperialism exploited our Taiwanese compatriots. The Taiwanese people could only obtain the most basic standard of living, and all the benefits were enjoyed by the Japanese. In the future, the development of Taiwan's economy should focus on the welfare of the public, so that the results of prosperity can be enjoyed by the public, so as to improve their living standards. Taiwan's existing industry is a tool used by the Japanese to carry out their industrial auxiliary policies, and in the future, its direction should be changed to make Taiwan Province a component of the country's overall economy, cooperating with each other.</p>

Regarding the US$500 million loan, the Ambassador said that he had not seen any news and said: The US attitude has not changed. Regarding the reorganization of the government and Zhang Qun's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan, the Ambassador said: Both the US government and the public have praised it. The Ambassador will not come again for the Yanjing University's Alumni Day on the 24th of this month.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] Beiping professors are indeed brewing a peace movement. It is reported that Zhou Binglin, Xu Deheng, Qian Duansheng, and others recently sent a document to relevant people in Shanghai, expressing their opinions on the current situation. They believe that the Political Consultative Conference was established at the beginning of the War of Resistance and was originally a symbol of unity among all parties. Today, if the Political Consultative Conference is to maintain its original intention and have power, it is necessary to invite CPC councilors to participate in this Political Consultative Conference. However, it did not explain how to invite CPC councilors to participate. Whether they will participate in this Political Consultative Conference depends on the realization. According to Qian Duansheng, Zhou, Xu, and Qian will express a separate opinion on the domestic peace issue, and it is not a joint effort with Zhang Lan, Zhang Bojun, and others. Zhang Shenfu of the Democratic League stated that the brewing of the peace movement is indeed happening, but under the current war situation, the conditions of both sides may be difficult to approach, and there will not be any success.</p>

<h3>Fu Zuoyi Flies to Taiyuan to Participate in Planning Defense Work; Wu Fort in Northern Shaanxi Recaptured, Communist Troops Fled to Jin Territory</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Amidst the tense atmosphere in Taiyuan, Fu Zuoyi, known for "defending cities," quietly flew to Taiyuan on the 12th for a historic meeting with his long-separated senior official, Yan Xishan. It is generally believed that not only will Zhangjiakou and Taiyuan's two Pacification Headquarters cooperate closely in the future to salvage the situation in Shanxi, but Fu is also very likely to directly participate in planning the defense of Taiyuan. According to reports, Fu became famous for firmly defending Zhuozhou during the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in the 16th year of the Republic [1927]. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], he was appointed as the Chairman of Suiyuan, entrusted with the mission of defending Taiyuan. After the victory at Pingxingguan, he also successfully defended Suiyuan and Baotou. It is also learned that the Central Government has ordered the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, and Hebei to send reinforcements to Shanxi immediately. Grain and funds, totaling 10 billion, were directly transported from the capital to Taiyuan two days ago, and subsequent shipments will continue.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 12th] On the afternoon of the 12th, Fu Zuoyi continued to exchange ideas with Yan Xishan and various senior generals on resolving the crisis in Shanxi. A plan has reportedly been agreed upon for the National Army in the Suiyuan pacification area under Fu's jurisdiction north of Yanmen Pass to coordinate operations with the National Army defending central Shanxi and Taiyuan. Fu is scheduled to host reporters on the morning of the 13th before flying to Beiping and then to Nanjing to report to the Central Government and Li Zongren and discuss methods for increasing reinforcements to relieve the crisis in Shanxi.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Datong, Suiyuan, 12th] A Communist detachment of 200 infantry and cavalry attacked Qingshui County on the morning of the day before yesterday, taking advantage of the lack of preparedness.

<h3>Our Country's Diplomatic Personnel System: Director Yin Discusses the Establishment of a Good Foundation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Our country's diplomatic personnel system has recently established a good foundation, moving towards the right track, and can serve as a model for other administrative personnel systems. Formal diplomatic officials engaged in foreign affairs have also obtained considerable professional security. Diplomatic administrative personnel and embassy and consulate staff below the rank of Jianren are all selected through examination, and the principle of "internal and external rotation" is gradually being implemented. On the 12th, a reporter visited Yin Baoyu, the former director of personnel at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who explained the current diplomatic personnel system as follows: The appointment of diplomatic personnel is currently based on selections from those who have passed the government's higher and ordinary examinations. To supplement the shortage of talent obtained through the national examination system, the Ministry established a "Nominee Selection Committee" in 1941 to hold regular examinations and select talent to supplement the previous recommendation method. Currently, except for Jianren officials, staff below the rank of specialist and section chief who enter the diplomatic service must pass the committee's examination. The Examination Yuan and the Ministry of Civil Service are consulted to improve and establish the system, which is gradually being implemented. Yin continued that the principle of internal and external rotation of diplomatic personnel was personally established by Chairman Chiang when he concurrently served as the minister, aiming to enable domestic and overseas personnel to have a thorough understanding of their duties and to achieve a balance between theory and practice. Personnel sent overseas are assigned for a term of three years, while those in tropical and frigid zones are assigned for two terms of two years. After the term expires, they are rotated between internal and external positions as much as possible. Due to transportation issues during the war, this was not fully realized, but it is now being gradually implemented. Regarding the current situation of rotation, Yin stated that embassies and consulates in various regions have resumed operations after the war. Because China's international status has increased compared to before the war, many countries have established new diplomatic relations with us, and the number of embassies and consulates has increased accordingly. China's diplomatic authorities have always placed emphasis on protecting overseas Chinese. Some overseas regions where overseas Chinese have suffered from the impact of the war are awaiting government protection, especially Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. The government has established many consulates in these areas after the war, and the number of personnel sent to overseas consulates has also increased accordingly. In addition, international conferences have become frequent in recent years, so the number of personnel actually sent overseas is far greater than those transferred internally. When the reporter finally inquired about the issue of career security for diplomatic officials, Yin replied that those who enter the diplomatic service through examination will not be dismissed by their superiors for any reason unless there is a specific fault. Overseas personnel cannot be transferred during their term unless there are special reasons. In addition, the heads of consulates currently sent abroad are all experienced individuals who have served in foreign missions, with the aim of enhancing the ability of each consul to respond to situations. It is noted that Yin Baoyu has now been transferred to serve as the Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and his vacancy will be filled by Yu Nengmo.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Plan for Reparations from Japan, the U.S. Refutes Soviet Accusations; Japan Can Hardly Accept the Demands of the Allied Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] A broadcast from Moscow's shortwave radio revealed that the Soviet Union's policy, which it insisted on at the Moscow Conference, that reparations based on current industrial production should be a condition for signing a peace treaty, will also be applied to the Japanese peace treaty issue. The commentary, broadcast in English by Simirnov, stated: "A portion of Japanese industry, especially the arms industry, needs to be completely destroyed, while another portion can be used for peaceful production and should supply reparations. According to the provisions of the peace treaty, the transfer of Japanese industrial equipment and a portion of Japan's current industrial production to Pacific nations as reparations within a certain period can help restore countries that were damaged in the war." The broadcast did not mention the Soviet Union's reparations demands, but only pointed out that the United States intends to allocate most of the reparations to countries economically connected to the United States.</p>
<p>The broadcast also reiterated its attacks on the U.S. occupation policy and reparations plan, pointing out that 500 Japanese factories originally listed for reparations, including 24 underground aircraft factories, have been removed from the list. This plan is actually part of the U.S.'s plan to transform Japan into a "U.S. military strategic and economic base."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Allied General Headquarters' Industrial Division stated: He does not know where the Soviet Union obtained the list of factories for reparations that were removed. The Far Eastern Commission intends to use over a thousand factories for reparations, but less than half have been completely confirmed to date. The Soviet Union has raised the same issue several times, and the Allied General Headquarters previously informed Derevyanko (head of the Soviet delegation to Japan) that the removal of some factories only removed their "name" but not their "reality." For example, the equipment in underground aircraft factories is easily damaged by humidity, so it was moved to above-ground warehouses. Or, factory names may be repeated on the list, or they may have been completely destroyed by bombing, so they were naturally canceled. One arms factory was removed because it actually manufactured telephone equipment, which is needed by the occupation authorities. Fewer than ten factories were truly removed because allocating them for reparations would affect Japan's national economy, but 25 factories were added to the list.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th] Well-informed sources in the Allied nations announced today: The total amount of reparations demands that countries related to Japan have already made or will make will reach a huge sum of several hundred billion U.S. dollars, which Japan's domestic and foreign assets cannot afford. When asked if a long-term repayment method could be used, a well-informed source replied: What was the result of the Allied nations demanding long-term reparations from Germany after the last World War?</p>
<h3>Almost All Looted Items in Japan Were Stolen from Our Country; Representatives of Various Countries Advocate House-to-House Searches</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Wu Bannong, head of the reparations group of our delegation to Japan, has returned after inspecting Japanese-looted items in various places with other Allied representatives. He believes that very few items have been seen. The Allied General Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to report the situation of looted items in detail, but Japan clearly did not comply. He believes that museums, libraries, and private collections should all be investigated, and reparations work should be accelerated, as we have only touched the surface of the problem so far. Wu said: Warehouses in Tokyo, Fukuoka, Osaka, and Nagoya have all been inspected. He saw many bronze bells and stone lions looted from China, and 95 percent of the looted items came from China, with the remainder being specialties from various parts of the South Seas. Wu will travel to Hokkaido with representatives from other countries at the end of this month to conduct an investigation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] Abrella, head of the Philippine reparations and restitution delegation to Japan, recently said: He wants to implement "house-to-house" inspections in Japan to recover items looted by the Japanese during the war. Abrella recently returned from searching for stolen goods in southern Japan and said: "Japan looted items from house to house in the Philippines. The only proper way for us to find these items is to implement house-to-house searches." He also said: He was greatly disappointed with the quantity of looted items announced by the Japanese in accordance with the orders of the Allied General Headquarters. Du克莱斯脱, head of the French reparations and restitution delegation here, said: He also expressed disappointment and believes that the Allied General Headquarters should issue an order imposing severe penalties on Japanese who violate the order and refuse to hand over looted items. The residences of important Japanese figures and former naval and army personnel should be immediately searched. Those who conceal looted items and are discovered must be punished, and examples must be set to serve as a warning, so that Japanese will no longer violate the order and conceal them. Officials of the Allied General Headquarters also said: The Japanese have concealed several billion U.S. dollars worth of looted items, and very few have been handed over.</p>

He claimed that his actions at the time were all "responding to the situation," that he was forced to do so, and he brought up the words and deeds of the deceased Zhu Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying as "unverifiable." The hearing recessed at 12:30 PM and resumed at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to investigate evidence of Yin's crimes and his assistance to the war of resistance. His testimony was largely the same as in the first trial. The hearing concluded at 4:30 PM, with the court ruling that, in accordance with the instructions of the Supreme Court's judgment, witnesses must be summoned and evidence investigated, and the retrial was adjourned to a later date, with the defendant remaining in custody.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Dependents and Teachers in Siam Dislike Immigration Quota Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 12th dispatch] Regarding the Siamese government's announcement on the 1st of this month of an immigration quota for overseas Chinese, temporarily set at 10,000 people per year, it is reported that in March of this year, the Prime Minister of Siam told our Ambassador to Siam, Li Tie Zheng, that the number of overseas Chinese immigrants entering Siam after the war was too large, far beyond what Siam's current economic situation could accommodate, and that they intended to set a quota based on the average number of immigrants per year from 1927 to 1945. Our embassy repeatedly protested sternly. As a result, the Siamese side respected our opinion and, in addition to the annual quota of 10,000 people, the dependents of overseas Chinese, their minor children, and teachers in overseas Chinese schools would not be restricted and could enter the country at any time. The issue of overseas Chinese education was also resolved at the same time as the immigration issue. It is reported that our government reserves the right to request revisions to the Siamese immigration quota at any time.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Developments in the Korean Situation</h3>
<p>The Korean issue had attracted world attention on the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. At that time, news about the Korean situation was scattered in newspapers around the world. The return of General Hodge, commander of the US military in South Korea, and his remarks had aroused attention from all sides. In addition, Dr. Syngman Rhee, the leader of the Korean revolution, visited the United States, and news about how the United States would support South Korea was repeatedly published in newspapers. Therefore, for a time, the world's eyes were somewhat focused on the Korean Peninsula. As the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference approached, the general speculation was that General Marshall would raise the issue of the Korean situation. The world has placed ardent hopes on the development of the Korean situation; the development of the Korean situation can be used to gauge the development of US-Soviet relations; and whether US-Soviet relations can be harmonious is the key to maintaining world peace. Therefore, when General Marshall raised the issue of the Korean situation after the meeting began, no matter how stern his wording was, the world did not feel strange, because they all had a premonition that this was an inevitable element. What the world cares about is the Soviet response. Now, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has replied to the US Secretary of State, expressing his willingness to accept the US proposal to reopen the Joint Commission in Korea to establish a basis for democratic unification in Korea. The transmission of this news seems to give the world a new hope for the development of the Korean situation; as if in the future the Korean situation, the Soviet Union has bowed to the United States, and the development of the Korean situation will inevitably tend to be simpler.</p>
<p>What we must first point out here is that if anyone thinks that the Soviet Union has accepted the US proposal for Korea, and that the Korean situation can be stabilized from now on, and that the unification of a democratic Korea can be achieved, this seems to be an illusion. We have no opportunity to read the original text of Molotov's reply to the US Secretary of State; we have no way to speculate on the wording of the reply. According to news reports, Molotov's reply agreed that all democratic parties should be involved in the Korean provisional government. It stated: "To my understanding, your proposal is to establish the conditions for negotiations with various Korean democratic parties and social groups before the Joint Commission resumes. This issue is also the subject of discussions between the US and Soviet commanders in Korea, and their opinions are quite close." As of this writing, we have not yet seen the US government's attitude towards the Soviet reply, so we have no way to deduce the US official intentions. However, according to news agency reports from Washington, the US government intends to revise its economic assistance program for Korea, and if the unification negotiations are successful, it intends to include both North and South Korea in the economic assistance program; and it is said that the Soviet Union's acceptance of the US proposal represents a psychological victory for the Truman Doctrine. It can be seen that the Soviet reply has already had a considerable effect in the United States.</p>
<p>The development of the Korean situation to the present stage, the problem is not entirely in the 38th parallel. From the viewpoint of forming a unified Korean regime, this involves the decision made by the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference regarding the Korean trusteeship, and the attitudes of the various Korean political groups towards the Moscow trusteeship decision. From the standpoint of the Korean people, it is understandable to oppose the trusteeship decision. The rule of the Japanese warlords in Korea has never eliminated the Korean people's national consciousness: now that the Japanese warlords have collapsed, it is the moment for the Korean nation to revive. They are eager for good governance, and they naturally have difficulty accepting the trusteeship decision. However, the trusteeship decision seems to be an international agreement: some people in North Korea and some pro-Soviet political groups use the trusteeship decision as a political capital to exclude dissidents. The failure of the Korean situation to be harmonious, the US-Soviet confrontation, and the trusteeship issue are all playing a role. If a unified Korea is to appear, there must first be a tacit understanding of the trusteeship issue, and then US-Soviet coordination can be sought, if coordination is possible. Only under this premise can the Korean situation have a clear hope and possibility.</p>
<p>According to news reports, the Soviet Union's acceptance of the US proposal is based on the understanding that Korean political groups will no longer have expressions and actions of resistance to the trusteeship decision in the future. If what is reported is true, then the Soviet Union's acceptance of the US proposal cannot be completely regarded as the Soviet Union bowing to the United States; on the contrary, the proposal of this understanding is enough to show the Soviet Union's victory. The political groups that are in tune with the Soviet Union have never opposed the trusteeship. On the one hand, the Soviet Union accepts the US proposal, and on the other hand, it takes this opportunity to force Korean political groups not to oppose the trusteeship. This is the Soviet Union's victory. Secondly, reports from the United States believe that the Soviet Union's acceptance of the US proposal indicates that the economic situation in North Korea is deteriorating, and it has no choice but to hope to receive US economic assistance. This is another Soviet victory. The Soviet reply can cause such psychological effects; it can be seen that it has caused considerable effects. What we must point out here is that since the announcement of the Truman Doctrine, the US attitude towards the Soviet Union has become tougher; therefore, the Soviet Union has had to use a new strategy to deal with the United States in some places. Without abandoning its persistent principles, the Soviet Union can adopt a relatively soft policy. This does no harm to itself, and further can gain the sympathy of some people. The Soviet Union seems to have adopted this policy on the Korean issue. What we have to see now is what effect the reconvening of the Joint Commission will have: if there are resolutions, whether these resolutions can be faithfully implemented. This is the biggest test.</p>
<p>There is also one point we must point out here, and that is that the Korean issue was first seen at the Cairo Conference; but the participants in the Cairo Conference were only the United States, China, and Britain. Therefore, China pays special attention to the development of the Korean situation. When the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was held in Moscow in March of this year, our government also revealed its attitude towards the Korean issue, "believing that the establishment and development of the Korean government should not be further delayed." It is in this sense that we welcome Molotov's recent reply to the US government on the Korean issue; undoubtedly, no matter what the effect of the Joint Commission will be in the future, the Soviet move will definitely benefit the establishment and development of the Korean government. We hope that the democratic unification of Korea can be expected from now on; and that in the near future, the Korean people will be able to display their inherent brilliance.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Rampant Between Guangdong and Hong Kong, Two New Routes Discovered</h3>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou 12th dispatch] It is reported that local smugglers have discovered two new routes for transporting goods to Hong Kong. One uses trucks, passing through Xintang on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and Taishan near the Humen Fort to Hong Kong. The other route first goes to Huangpu in the lower reaches of the Pearl River, and then is transported by boat to Hong Kong. These two routes have only been open for a week, and smugglers' profits have increased several times. Many Guangzhou merchants have recently resorted to smuggling exports to evade the customs' new regulations. Importers also find smuggling more convenient, as it avoids the complicated procedures of foreign exchange settlement and customs declaration, and the profits can be even greater. Today, due to the fall in the Hong Kong dollar, the prices of imported goods have also fallen slightly.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Pontianak, Borneo, 11th] The government of the Dutch East Indies issued a statement today, declaring that economic negotiations between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia have failed, and accusing Indonesia of being uncooperative.</p>
<p>The statement was issued simultaneously in Batavia and Pontianak, claiming that negotiations began after the signing of the agreement recognizing the Republic of Indonesia on March 25th, with the aim of returning raw materials from Java and Sumatra to the world market, controlling imports and exports, establishing a joint Dutch-Indonesian foreign exchange fund, and jointly managing tariffs, so that indigenous goods could be exported immediately. The Indonesian proposal involved all parts of Indonesia, including both the Republic and non-Republic areas, and failed to unconditionally guarantee the return of foreign assets within the Republic to their original owners.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] The "New Daily" of the Republic of Indonesia reported that the recent Indonesian cabinet meeting seemed to recognize that conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands was unavoidable, and that since the signing of the Linggadjati Agreement on March 25th, Indonesian-Dutch relations have been in a stalemate, with no progress in either political or economic aspects.</p>
<p>Strong Indonesian Criticism</p>
<p>Indonesian President Sukarno has repeatedly pointed out that the Dutch side has engaged in acts that violate the agreement, such as the establishment of the State of East Indonesia, allowing autonomy in West Borneo, and supporting the establishment of a free state in Pasundan, West Java, all of which are major violations by the Dutch. The "New Daily" stated that the Republic of Indonesia's response will be to adopt an open policy of non-cooperation and implement a severe counter-blockade against the Dutch blockade. According to sources, the "New Daily" has close ties with the Republic's Information Department, and its views can reflect the official Indonesian stance.</p>

<h3>US Strengthens Northern Defenses; Air Force Base Built in Alaska; Soviet Outpost in the Arctic Also Resumes Activity</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 12th] The United States, to ensure the security of its northern defense left flank, is building at least one giant bomber base in Alaska, corresponding to a similar base in Maine. This can be seen in the War Department's report today, which states that the Strategic Air Command is building a new runway, large-scale hangars, and other facilities at a base 26 miles southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, at a cost of $8,125,000.

The outpost is located at 81 degrees 45 minutes north latitude and was established in 1936, but its activities were suspended in 1942 due to the war. Rudolf Island was the starting point for Soviet aircraft exploring the Arctic. In 1942, all buildings, armories, food reserves, fuel, and clothing were carefully sealed to prevent air intrusion. A group of Soviet experts has now arrived on the island, and reports indicate that the stored materials are still in excellent condition.</p>
<h3>Kim Gu Organizes Korean Provisional Government; Hodge Issues Statement Deeming it Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 12th] Lieutenant General Hodge, the Military Governor of South Korea, issued an important statement today regarding Kim Gu and others' plans to discuss the organization of a provisional government, stating: Kim Gu and others organized a Korean provisional government in China before the Japanese surrender. When they returned to Korea via Shanghai after the Japanese surrender, they agreed with the United States to return to the country as individuals, not in the name of the provisional government, and to immediately dissolve the provisional government to gain the trust of the United States. The South Korean Military Government also solemnly declared when Kim Gu and others returned to South Korea that no provisional government of any nature would be allowed to be established in South Korea other than the Military Government. Therefore, it is inappropriate for Kim Gu and others to now convene a meeting to discuss the organization of a provisional government. It is also reported that the Police Chief considers the meeting of Korean representatives from various regions to be held on the 15th of this month in Taejeon, Gyeongsangnam-do, to discuss the organization of a provisional government to be illegal and will be prohibited.</p>

Miki then stated that the Cooperative Party was willing to accept the Socialist Party's recommendation of Katayama as the head of the cabinet.

<h3>General Labor Union Congress Resolves to Thoroughly Investigate Impersonators Disrupting Society; Demands Amendment to the Discount on the Indexation Based on the Assessment Committee's Plan; Nine Representatives Presumed to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>The second session of the General Labor Union Congress was held yesterday at 1:00 p.m. More than 500 representatives from 362 labor unions attended. Director Lu of the Social Affairs Department, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Section Chief Cao of the City Party Headquarters were also present. The meeting began at 2:00 p.m. and elected Zhou Xuexiang, Fan Cai, and Zhang Jindi as the presidium. After the chairman of the union, Shui Xiangyun, and Secretary-General Liang Yongzhang reported on the union's affairs, Director Lu of the Social Affairs Department delivered a speech, followed by Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, who stated: (1) Gratitude to the General Labor Union for assisting the government in handling labor-management disputes, promoting the improvement of workers' lives, and assisting in the implementation of labor policies over the past year. (2) In the past, worker organizations were scattered, but thanks to the efforts of the General Labor Union over the past year, 382 labor unions have joined the General Labor Union, with a total of 450,000 members. This is indeed an achievement of the responsible leadership of the General Labor Union. In the future, it is hoped that all workers in the city will participate in labor unions, and that the organization of each labor union will be very sound. (3) Regarding the de-freezing of the cost-of-living index, when prices fluctuated in late last month and workers' lives were unstable, I paid attention to this at the time. When Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs came to Shanghai, he invited the leaders of labor and management, as well as the city's chamber of commerce and industrial association, to discuss the matter together, and the conclusions were recommended to the government. The current de-freezing measures are a reasonable adjustment made by the government from an overall economic perspective, maintaining the survival of factories on the one hand and guaranteeing the minimum living standards of workers on the other. Finally, Wu added that after this de-freezing, the wage expenditure of general factories increased by 40%, and he hoped that the representatives would inform the workers of each factory to improve work efficiency in order to stabilize the survival of factories. He also reported on the government's relief to unemployed workers in Yangshupu, expressing much sympathy. He emphasized that it is better to be employed than unemployed, and that low wages are better than government relief, and hoped that workers would strive to increase work efficiency. After the representative of the City Party Headquarters delivered a speech, the meeting immediately discussed the agenda. It was resolved that, regarding the discount on the de-freezing of the cost-of-living index, the government should be required to amend it according to the original plan of the Shanghai Labor-Management Assessment Committee (according to the plan of the Labor-Management Assessment Committee, those with a base salary of 30 yuan or less would be paid in full according to the index, and those with a salary of 31 yuan or more and 100 yuan or less would receive a 5% discount for every 10 yuan. The government's approved plan is a 10% discount for every 10 yuan), and representatives Shui Xiangyun, Qiu Changjiang, Gui Fusheng, Feng Yayun, Hu Kun, Dong Rengui, Tang Guifen, Wang Yuxiang, and Xu Zhouliang were sent to Beijing to petition the relevant ministries and commissions. Dong had already left by train last night. A temporary motion was also passed: (1) To send a telegram to the government requesting a thorough crackdown on the Communist Party to stabilize social order and increase production. (2) Recently, various Western newspapers have published reports of impersonators using the name of the General Labor Union to disrupt social order, and the General Labor Union will send personnel to investigate thoroughly. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Telecommunications Employees Continue "Hunger Strike"; Negotiations Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Employees of the Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station and the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau have been on "hunger strike" for three days, and negotiations were still unresolved as of last night. Deputy Director Jiang of the Telecommunications Administration, who came to Shanghai from Beijing the night before, met with the persons in charge of the bureau and station and six employee representatives of the bureau and station until 4:00 a.m. yesterday. After several consultations, Deputy Director Jiang agreed to withdraw funds from the colleagues' welfare fund and issue them to employees: (1) Those who do not live in dormitories will be given a monthly housing subsidy of 100,000 yuan, (2) Those who do not take the transportation vehicle will be given a monthly transportation fee of 50,000 yuan, (3) The busy subsidy will be increased from 64,000 yuan to 128,000 yuan, (4) The night shift subsidy will be increased from 22,000 yuan to 44,000 yuan. The representatives held a liaison meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday and conveyed the information to the employees of the bureau and station. After all the colleagues signed their rejection, they still insisted on demanding the same treatment as postal workers. At 5:00 p.m., Director Fang of the Party Headquarters and Deputy Director Jiang visited the bureau to comfort all the colleagues, stating that the treatment of civil servants would soon be adjusted, and that the country was at a time of economic crisis, and they hoped that they could understand the difficulties and accept the conditions discussed by Jiang and the six representatives yesterday morning and immediately resume normal work. The employees did not express their agreement because they were too far from what they were asking for. At 8:30 p.m., the employees of both sides each elected five people as the official delegation to negotiate with Deputy Director Jiang again. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 p.m., still without a result. It was decided to continue negotiations this morning.</p>

<h3>Suburban Telephone Lines Clear and Uninterrupted</h3>

<h3>Debate Concludes on Wang Zhuchen's Case of Concealing Enemy Property</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of Wang Zhuchen concealing materials from the enemy's Changdao Foreign Company, which was handled by the Clearance Group, has been tried by the District Court several times. Because the case is serious, the District Court specially formed a collegial panel yesterday to hear the debate between the prosecutor and the defendant and his lawyer.

According to the defendant, he repaired cars for the garrison command free of charge in a special contract, and used auto parts left over from the enemy's Changdao Foreign Company to compensate for his required expenses, but he could not provide strong evidence, and there was obvious behavior of encroaching on enemy property. The defendant Wang Zhuchen stated that he was detained after the case was filed and could not collect favorable evidence, and requested the court to give him a chance, but the request was rejected by the Presiding Judge.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Memorial Week: Chairman Fang's Address - Elements Disrupting Social Order Absolutely Cannot Be Tolerated</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, the Municipal Party Headquarters held an expanded memorial week at the municipal stadium. Over a thousand people attended. Chairman Fang presided over the event. After the formalities, Mr. Fang commented on the current situation in Shanghai, stating roughly: What we need most right now is social stability. In the past month, labor strikes, rice riots, and student unrest have occurred one after another in the city. Fortunately, Mayor Wu and Social Bureau Director Wu, and Education Bureau Director Gu, have gone to Nanjing successively to consult with the central government on the issues of unfreezing the cost of living index, the distribution of rice, and the joint entrance examination. Reasonable solutions have been decided upon, which should bring these matters to a conclusion. However, communist elements and their remnants, who are hiding in this city, specialize in disrupting order and inciting unrest. Recently, a secret document of the Communist Party, entitled "Underground Work Struggle Line," was seized. This proves that the arsons that occurred in various places previously and the recent rice robberies and other illegal acts were all instigated or directed by someone. We absolutely cannot tolerate the existence of these disruptive elements who undermine social order.</p>
<p>Imposters Using False Names to Cause Trouble</p>
<p>It was also seen yesterday in the mainland newspapers that someone named Chen Daoqing (transliteration), claiming to represent the Industry and Public Utility Workers' Alliance, openly wrote to the municipal government and the national government, demanding the unconditional unfreezing of the cost of living index and threatening a general strike and the occupation of public utilities to form a local government. According to Mr. Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, the highest-level workers' organization in the city, there is no such organization among the workers in the city, nor is there a person named Chen Daoqing in the labor community. It is clear that imposters are using false names to cause trouble. The government has already decided to reasonably resolve the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index, which can be considered to have met the demands of the workers. Even if there are still points to discuss, opinions should only be expressed legally for the government to consider, and there should be no excessive actions to threaten the government. It is hoped that my fellow workers in Shanghai will thoroughly investigate this illegal act of impersonation. It is especially hoped that the press will refrain from spreading unfounded news intended to incite unrest, so as not to fall into the trap of the troublemakers.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan Speaks on Central Goal</p>
<p>Subsequently, Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, stating that the central goal of today's politics is to seek progress for the nation on a foundation of stability. Regarding the workers' cost of living index, the central government has already decided on a method of unfreezing and adjusting it. In terms of rice, the government has improved distribution and is giving priority to workers in factories, public education personnel, and students in various schools. This is the policy currently adopted by the government to seek stability. While the people of all sectors are concerned about their personal lives, they should still cooperate with the government's policies and work towards social stability. Finally, Chairman Shui Xiangyun of the General Labor Union delivered a speech, and the ceremony concluded around eleven o'clock.</p>

Upon further questioning of the witness, Sun stated: "V. I. Chenko told me this." The court immediately reprimanded him, saying, "It is illegal to give false testimony. Considering that you are uneducated, we will forgive you once. Otherwise, we will send you to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation." Sun responded obsequiously and withdrew. The court decided to adjourn the case for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Principal Sues Two Teachers for Defamation: Case Opens for Trial</h3>
<p>Pan Wenzhen, the principal of the National Primary School on Shaanxi North Road, and Chen Suyun and Wu Baoqin, two teachers at the school, previously had a widely publicized fight. Now, Pan Wenzhen has suddenly filed a lawsuit with the District Court against Chen and Wu for defamation. The case was opened for trial yesterday morning in the Second Criminal Division of the District Court by Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu. The court first questioned the plaintiff, Pan Wenzhen, who testified that the defendant Chen Suyun harbored a grudge against her because she had been suspended. Chen then colluded with Wu Baoqin to distribute a booklet entitled "The Truth About Pan Wenzhen's Assault on Chen Suyun," which contained false accusations of her promiscuous relationships and other matters. "This is completely unfounded and damages my reputation, so I have filed this lawsuit and request legal protection," she said. The court then questioned the defendant, Chen Suyun, who testified that during the Wuding Road fire, she witnessed Pan moving all the fees collected by the school out, but Pan falsely claimed that they were burned and falsely reported to the Education Bureau, intending to re-collect fees from the students. She reported this truthfully to Pan, which led to a conflict and aroused public anger throughout the education community, leading to the organization of the "United Association for the Protection of Teachers' Rights" to support her. This booklet was printed and distributed by the association and has nothing to do with her, she said. The second defendant, Wu Baoqin, gave the same testimony, claiming that the booklet had nothing to do with them and therefore they could not be held responsible.

They forcibly demanded ten cartons of Baixi cigarettes, and when he refused, they beat Sun severely. As a result, under duress, he agreed to buy two cartons of cigarettes. Because he did not have enough cash on him, he borrowed 60,000 yuan in cash from the owner of a chicken and duck blood soup stall whom he knew well, and gave it to them before they dispersed, and they agreed that he would have to pay another 60,000 yuan on the 15th to be safe.

<h3>Reader Consultation: Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Bronchitis</p>
<p>Zhao Sufen asks: I am eighteen years old this year and have been physically weak since childhood. I developed bronchitis at the age of five or six and have suffered from it for over ten years. I have been treated by famous doctors both Chinese and foreign, but with no effect. I had an X-ray examination of my lungs, which showed no lung disease. I would like to know: (1) Are there any specialized physicians who treat this disease, and can it be cured completely? (2) How should I take care of myself, and what foods should I avoid? (3) Is it harmful to my health to study at school and read the newspaper every day?</p>
<p>[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] (1) The Department of Internal Medicine at the Shanghai Municipal Public Hospital and various internal medicine doctors can treat chronic bronchitis. (2) There is no specific cure, but you can inject glucose calcium and calcium iodide, and take multiple vitamin pills and cod liver oil to strengthen your body. Avoid catching colds and prevent various infections by dripping medicine into your nose and frequently gargling with hydrogen peroxide and Listerine mouthwash. When you have asthma, you can use Asmac tablets. Many cases of bronchitis are related to nasal problems, so it is advisable to check the nasal cavity for chronic inflammation. (3) Reading and studying is not a problem.</p>
<p>(2) Prematurely Gray Hair</p>
<p>Fang Ruisen asks: I am twenty-three years old (unmarried) and in good health. Over the years, the hair on the back of my head has turned gray, like silver threads. It is very unsightly. I would like to know: (1) What is this condition? (2) What medicines can treat it?</p>
<p>[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] Having white hair at the young age of twenty-three suggests possible physical weakness, blood deficiency, or endocrine deficiencies. You should consult a doctor for a detailed physical examination and, if necessary, take or inject blood-tonifying and endocrine-supplementing medications.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of Talent Cultivation: A Lecture Delivered at the Shanghai Municipal Yucai Middle School Weekly Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Mr. Pan Gongzhan, recorded by Tang Peixian and Zhou Yunsheng</p>
<p>Fellow students: Today, Principal Yuan asked me to come to your school to say a few words, so I am taking this opportunity to talk about the meaning of the two characters "Yu Cai" (育才, cultivate talent).</p>
<p>Your school has a very long history. It was formerly established by the Municipal Council and taken over by the Municipal Government after the victory. It is hoped that your school will cultivate excellent talents for the locality and the country. Your school's name is also "Yucai." As for how to cultivate and what constitutes talent, that is what I want to talk about today. All of you come to school, from elementary school to middle school, and from middle school to university graduation, all hoping to develop your talents for the country in the future. As for how to develop each person's talents, it depends on the education each person receives at school, especially during this middle school stage. Because middle school is a process in which everyone undergoes the most changes from childhood to adulthood, and it is also the most difficult to grasp. Therefore, education should be given special attention in this stage, and all teachers, parents, and you yourselves should pay special attention.</p>
<p>There are many methods of cultivating talent, which cannot be covered in a short time. Your teachers must have mentioned them at ordinary times. I will now briefly outline them:</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen once said: "To make China rich, strong, and prosperous, it is necessary to first achieve the four points of making the best use of people's talents, land, things, and smooth flow of goods." According to this statement, let us think further. Among these four points, the first point is the most important. For example, to achieve the point of "making the best use of the land," the most important thing is whether the talent can be properly employed. My country has vast land and abundant resources, which is world-renowned, but if the people of the country do not have knowledge and skills, how can the land be used to its full potential? As for "making the best use of things," first of all, someone must know how to use it. If people do not have talent, then abundant resources are fundamentally useless, because they cannot be used properly. Looking at other countries today, they not only "make the best use of things," but also can use waste materials, but our country cannot even use "available materials." Therefore, during the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "One person should be used as two, one cent should be used as two, and one thing should be used as two (or even three or four) in order to overcome the difficulties." When it comes to "smooth flow of goods," if there is no talent to develop it, transportation will be inconvenient, and coupled with sabotage everywhere, how can transportation be convenient? How can goods flow smoothly? In short, the most important thing is to make the best use of talent.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen, in his letter to Li Hongzhang in the late Qing Dynasty, mentioned three steps regarding "cultivating talent": (1) teaching and nurturing with proper methods, (2) encouraging with appropriate methods, and (3) employing with effective methods. These three steps should be carried out simultaneously so that everyone in a country has talent and can be used. Although talents vary in size, they should be used to their full potential. I will now talk about the first step: If students do not receive a good education at school, then many talents will be buried in school, harming our country and our society. Therefore, students should all have the belief of "self-respect" and "self-awareness." I most disagree with people saying: "There is no talent now (or in a certain era)." This is absolutely unacceptable. I believe that there are talents everywhere at any time. We just need to discover them, cultivate them, and use them. For example, in Chinese history, during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (Li Shimin), there were many talented people in the court. But we should know that these talents were not created by the Tang Dynasty. They were all former officials of the Sui Dynasty. Why didn't they build the Sui Dynasty into a strong and prosperous one during the Sui Dynasty? Why could they demonstrate their talents in the Tang Dynasty? This is because the Sui Dynasty did not make good use of talent. Therefore, as long as a person has talent, they will not be buried forever. One day they will stand out and show themselves. As long as they are employed effectively, there will be "talents" at any time and anywhere. Sun Yat-sen also said: "Talents vary in intelligence, and without learning, it is impossible to distinguish their talents; talents have completeness and partiality, and without learning, it is impossible to develop their use." A person's natural endowment has intelligence and foolishness, but without "cultivation," their talents cannot be developed. The size of "talent" is irrelevant, but whether it can be used well is. "Talent" is divided into "all-round talent" and "specialized talent." "All-round talent" is broad talent. "Specialized talent" is research focused on one area. Or to say that "all-round talent" is "generalist", "specialized talent" is "expert", "generalist" and "expert" each have their uses. But a "generalist" cannot be used as an "expert", and an "expert" cannot be used as a "generalist". For example, if a student has the talent to study "mathematics," but his parents insist that he study "literature," then the employment is not effective. The "misguided teaching that buries talent" that I mentioned earlier is also based on this point.</p>
<p>A student's achievement depends on the teacher for a small part, and on themselves for a large part. In addition to their own efforts, they should also have good teachers and helpful friends. In this excellent environment, if you can constantly strive for self-improvement, you will all be talents in the future. Talents may be big or small, but as long as I dedicate my "talents" to the public, society, and country as much as possible, I will have fulfilled my responsibility. Therefore, every student must not have the thought of "self-abandonment," and must not think that their talents are small and their aptitude is foolish, and "willingly degenerate." Otherwise, even if there are good teachers to teach and parents to cultivate, it will be useless.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to tell you is that in addition to learning all the knowledge and skills in books, we students should also pay attention to the cultivation of morality, and how to be a person in the world. In other words, we cannot leave "virtue" and only talk about "talent." If we only have "talent" and no "virtue," then it is the same as having no "talent." Therefore, if we have "talent," we must also have "virtue." Therefore, a person must see if he has "virtue" to achieve his "talent." The ancients said: "Achieve virtue and attain talent." If "achieving virtue" and "attaining talent" are combined, it becomes "cultivating talent." You will all have opportunities to develop your "talents" in the future. I hope you will work hard to learn and advance in both "virtue" and "talent" to complete great talents. (Due to time constraints, this article has not been submitted to Mr. Pan Gongzhan for revision.

<h3>Tight Money Supply · Labor Unrest Threat · Chinese Stocks Plunge Across the Board Yesterday · Wing On Textiles Falls to Limit and Approaches Today's Limit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks plunged across the board due to a tight money supply and the renewed threat of strikes. Mid-session, the slight rebound due to the Shanghai Electric Power Company's rally was ultimately negated. Wing On Textiles plummeted to the daily limit and approached today's limit.</p>
<p>At the opening, the market opened much lower due to news of extremely tight liquidity in the financial sector over the weekend, with major banknotes also being suspended from issuance. Subsequently, Wing On Textiles opened at $5250 and presented excessive supply, with #152, #85, #91, #183, #22, #4, #197, #163, #224 all selling aggressively, causing it to fall to the daily limit. Then, American Asia was quoted down to the limit by #65, #140, #25, Wing On Textiles by #140, and Matches by #223 and #91. Da Tong, Wing On Public, China Textiles, Tongyi, China Silk, and Jingfu all plummeted to their limits, and Wing On Textiles was further pushed down to within $5000. At 10:20 AM, #65, #76, #141, and #171 took deliveries, and Wing On Textiles rose to $5130. #159 and #183 continued to sell, resulting in another drop. #47, #160, #223, and #76 continued to settle positions, briefly pushing the price down to a low of $4960. Later, due to repeated reports of rising prices for Hong Kong Electric Power, buying interest began to pick up at 11:20 AM, with #54, #228, #143, #89, #232, #171, and #186 buying again, and the price rose to $5180 near noon. #129, #160, and #154 added to the settling, and the midday closing price retreated to around $5100.</p>
<p>After the close, bid prices were low then high, and finally around $5150. Compared to last Saturday, American Asia fell to the limit, Wing On Textiles rebounded slightly after hitting the limit, down nearly 10%, Sin Wah fell more than 10%, New Kwong was only slightly down due to independent support from #204, as was Jingfu, Chun Hing fell more than half a percent, New China fell slightly less than 10%, and Wing On Public also fell 10%. For immediate delivery, American Asia fell to the limit, and Wing On Textiles rebounded after hitting the limit, down less than 10%. The same was true for Sin Wah, Wing On Public and Chun Hing fell by half a percent, and New Kwong and Jingfu fell slightly. Among the unpopular stocks, Da Tong, Matches, and China Silk rebounded after falling to the limit, each down about 10%. New Chiyu and Commerce fell more than half a percent, and Cement fell 10%. King Lun fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the money supply became even tighter, and #207 was the first to sell aggressively, with Wing On Textiles opening at the limit for immediate delivery. #129 also sold, and Wing On Textiles fell to $4850. At this time, American Asia, Matches, Wing On Public, Da Tong, China Textiles, and China Silk all fell to the limit. #143 and #152 moved lower to buy in, raising the price to $4950. Commerce, Tongyi, and Sin Wah also fell to the limit. #224, #77, #99, #16, #154, and #207 sold again, breaking $4800. New Asia and Wing Salt also hit the limit, and New Kwong, Jingfu, and Chun Hing were also forced to the limit. #235, #14, and #160 sold off, and Wing On Textiles fell to within $4650. Near the close, the price struggled around $4670. After the close, #4 and others continued to sell, resulting in further declines. The sudden severity of labor unrest made people nervous. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Textiles, Wing On Public, American Asia, and Sin Wah fell to the limit, and New China, New Kwong, Jingfu, and Chun Hing fell less than half a percent. For immediate delivery, Wing On Textiles, Sin Wah, American Asia, and Wing On Public fell to the limit. New Kwong, Jingfu, and Chun Hing fell slightly less than half a percent. Among the unpopular stocks, Wing Fung, China Textiles, Tongyi, Da Tong, China Silk, Matches, New Asia, and Commerce fell to their limits, and King Lun and Cement fell slightly less than half a percent. Outside the exchange, all stocks plunged, with supply exceeding demand. For Wing On Textiles arbitrage, #47 of Farmers paid $120 in the afternoon, but only about 27 cents. It is heard that interest rates for inter-dealer transactions outside the market were as high as 50 cents or more.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Decline Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks saw Yi-Zhing up to 19 outside on the Hong Kong-Shanghai power surge. Jardine Matheson fell to $59,000 on the spot, brokers and money exchangers added to the selling. Although there was a slight rebound mid-session due to the Shanghai Electric Power Company's rally, it still fell again following the overall trend in the afternoon. The low price reached $51,500 before stabilizing slightly. Guangzhou brokers and foreign firms absorbed some stock. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yi-Zhing, Union Insurance, Navigation, and Steel all fell by 25%, Yee Guang, KenTing, and Kaiping each fell by 20%, and the remaining stocks fell by 10% to 15%.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Weaken</h3>
<p>Government bonds also weakened yesterday due to the impact of the tight money supply. United Series C opened at $14,200, the high price was $14,500, rooms 360 and 503 sold, and gradually fell to $11,200. At noon, it hovered outside $12,000. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Series A and B fell by $1,500, Series C fell by $2,400, Series D fell by $1,700, and Series E fell by $1,400. Trading volume was approximately $5.6 million.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Gold Shops from Various Regions to Petition in the Capital on a Set Date</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the emergence of black market prices for gold, the business of gold shops across the country has virtually come to a standstill, and they all feel unable to maintain huge expenditures. It is now heard that representatives of gold shops from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will gather in Nanjing before the 15th of this month to petition relevant agencies such as the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Senate, with the main requests being: (1) asking the government to allocate raw materials, and (2) if raw materials cannot be allocated, then asking to restore the free trading system of the industry. If these requests still cannot be fulfilled, then gold shops across the country will decide to shut down completely at the end of this month. Regarding the gold shop industry in this city, Wu Pengnian, Yao Guiqing, Chen Dezhang, and Qiu Yungen have been designated to participate in the petition. It is heard that Mr. Wu and his party are scheduled to go to the capital by early train today.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Commission Approves Two Important Cases: Cotton Yarn Spun from Last Year's Stockpile Will No Longer Be Purchased at Half the Quantity; New Agreed Price for 20-Count Standard Yarn Set at $5.4 Million Per Piece</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The 33rd regular meeting of the Textile Control Commission was held at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM. Wu (concurrently Chairman), Li (Vice-Chairman), and Commissioners Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, and Tang Xinghai, as well as Liu Wenteng and Wang Zijian from the commission, attended. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM after passing two important resolutions, which are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding cotton yarn spun from cotton stockpiled at the end of last December, various yarn mills believe that the current depreciation of currency and the sharp rise in cotton prices mean that the purchase price set by the government is insufficient to cover the cost of reproduction. Moreover, the more cotton stockpiled by each yarn mill, the less foreign cotton they can be allocated. Furthermore, the government's purchase of cotton yarn spun from cotton stockpiled at the end of last December is limited to yarn mills in the Shanghai area, which seems unfair. After Wu (concurrently Chairman) submitted it to the National Price Committee for discussion, it was approved that, starting from April of this year, this cotton yarn will be exempt from being purchased at half the quantity. However, this does not apply to cotton yarn spun from cotton allocated by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and foreign cotton. It was presented to the meeting yesterday and approved for implementation. (2) The new agreed price for cotton yarn has also been approved by the National Price Committee. The price is set at $5.4 million per piece, based on 20-count standard yarn, and will be implemented starting today. However, the purchase price for 20-count yarn will temporarily remain at the old price of $4.6 million per piece. (The cotton cost used for the new agreed price is calculated based on $750,000 for Relief and Rehabilitation Administration cotton and $1.8 million for the market price of cotton. However, the percentage used for calculation is slightly different from that calculated by private yarn mills.) It was also presented and approved for implementation yesterday.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The methods for reviewing and approving applications for transshipment of yarn and cloth were drafted by the commission and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. It is now reported that the ministry has issued instructions to the commission and is expected to announce them today.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The registration matters for the commission's handling of yarn and cloth for applications to various ports in Hebei and Northeast China expired yesterday. A total of 667 manufacturers have obtained registration forms. However, yesterday, manufacturers flocked to obtain and submit forms, so the commission has specially extended the deadline for submitting forms to the end of today. After this, the review process will begin, and it is expected to be completed in about a week.</p>
<h3>Measures to Prevent the Resale of "Purchase Permits" for Textile Construction</h3>
<p>Recently, amid price fluctuations, the market price of yarn and cloth has risen sharply, significantly exceeding the allocation price set by the authorities. Obtaining an allocation of yarn and cloth can generate more than double the profit in the blink of an eye. It has recently been discovered that some manufacturers are directly transferring and selling the "purchase permits" allocated by the Textile Construction Corporation in order to seek huge profits. This behavior violates the authorities' intention of allocation. It is now learned that, in order to prevent the resale of "purchase permits," the China Textile Public Company has specially stipulated four measures to add seals for prevention, starting yesterday (the 12th): (1) Each customer must affix the same seal on the purchase permit when submitting the purchase request form every morning. Omissions will be rejected and invalidated. (2) The endorsement of bank cashier's checks used to pay for the goods must bear the same seal. (3) The back of the warehouse receipt must also bear the same seal. (4) If the seals on the purchase permit, payment check, and warehouse receipt do not match, the payment or delivery will be refused, and the allocation will be suspended. Starting yesterday, the purchase request forms used by manufacturers have been replaced with new forms by the company, and the old forms are invalid. Seals are affixed in accordance with the announced measures for affixing seals. It is expected that the evil practice of reselling "purchase permits" will gradually disappear.</p>
<h3>Import Control Commission Simplifies Extension Matters for Letters of Credit and Import Licenses</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank yesterday issued Circular No. 98 to various designated banks, stating in brief: In order to simplify the extension matters for letters of credit and import licenses, the Executive Committee of the Import Control Commission has approved the following measures:</p>
<p>1.  For letters of credit opened after November 17, 1946, designated banks may extend them based on the import validity period stated on the import license. The designated banks shall report these extensions to the Central Bank and the relevant departments of the Import Control Commission that approved the extension on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>2.  The extension of import licenses still requires review by the Import Control Commission. Applicants should directly send a letter to the commission to handle the relevant parts of the approved foreign exchange application form.</p>
<p>3.  For letters of credit opened before November 17, 1946, and for which all foreign exchange has been settled with the designated bank, and the extension application is submitted within one month after the expiration of the letter of credit, the extension matters shall be handled by the Non-Quota Import Review Office. The extension period for letters of credit opened before November 17, 1946, shall not be later than June 30 of this year.</p>
<p>The relevant sections mentioned in the bank's Circular No. 97 shall be abolished.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Stops Market Sales of Rice; Measures for Allocating Rice Decided; Targeting Teachers, Factory Workers, and the Poor</h3>
<p>Regarding the city's food problem, Mayor Wu stated yesterday that public officials and teachers, as well as boarding students from various schools, will be directly allocated rice by the Municipal Government. The poor will be allocated rice by weight at distribution points established by the government. He also stated that the detailed measures are still being discussed by Wu (Director of the Social Affairs Bureau) in Nanjing, and will be prepared and implemented after his return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is now learned that Director Wu returned to Shanghai by overnight train the day before yesterday. Reporters visited him yesterday and were informed that the rice allocation measures have been roughly agreed upon, and the implementation procedures are still being discussed and decided. In the future, (1) boarding students of national universities, teachers and boarding students of private universities, (2) boarding students of municipal middle schools, teachers and boarding students of private middle schools, (3) teachers of private elementary schools, and (4) factory workers will all be allocated rice at a limit of two dou (pecks) per person per month. Each school and factory will first submit a roster to the bureau for verification, and allocation will be carried out immediately. However, private schools are limited to those that have been registered, and factories are limited to those that have been registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and have a ministry certificate or a receipt from the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Regarding the poor, measures will be modeled after the discounted rice sales. First, each district office will discuss and decide on the measures, starting with an investigation. After the rosters are complete, allocation will be carried out by district, and flour may be bundled for sale in the future to make adjustments. All implementation measures are currently under discussion. Implementation will begin after an agreement is reached with relevant agencies.</p>
<p>Reporters also inquired about the standards for the poor and the allocation quantity. Mr. Wu said that the standards for the poor will start with slum dwellers, and the allocation quantity has been slightly changed. After consultation with the Ministry of Food, one dou (peck) per month will be allocated per person, and five sheng (pints) for young children. As for the addresses of the district public sales offices, they will be set up at the original locations where the Social Affairs Bureau sold discounted flour last year, with merchants commissioned to handle the sales and a handling fee subsidized to the commissioned merchants. The district offices will issue rice purchase certificates for the rice allocation measures, and people can purchase rice at the public sales offices with the certificates. Regarding the roster format for schools and factories applying for rice allocation, Mr. Wu said that the Social Affairs Bureau will announce a unified format soon, and the content will be very simple, only requiring the name, origin, position, identification number, and address. Furthermore, the Social Affairs Bureau has stopped selling 9,000 bags of rice to the market daily, starting yesterday.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Conditions Weaken</h3>
<p>The allocation of rayon is imminent. Although it is rumored that the selling price will increase to $9.8 million, there is still a huge difference compared to the black market. Therefore, in yesterday's market, #120 Kosan Arai was weak at the opening. In the morning, it hovered between $16.2 million and $16.3 million, and closed at $6.2 million. In the afternoon, market sentiment was even more fragile, and peers retreated to $5.8 million due to tight liquidity, a significant drop of $1.5 million compared to last weekend. Due to the shortage of goods, #75 Semi-Gloss was only down by $1 million.</p>
<p>Factory silk was also weak in yesterday's market. Deals were only made for C-grade products at $18.5 million with a 7-day bill, and high-grade products were priced separately at $17.6 million, both down by $500,000 compared to last weekend. There were no other transactions, only bid prices.</p>
<p>Silk fabric transactions were quiet. The bid prices for quilt covers remained unchanged in the morning, but there were no transactions. Checked crepe was traded at $29,600. Reports from the Shengze production area were lower, with the price of pure electric plain weave greige fabric at $250,000, so the price in Shanghai yesterday was also $30,000 lower.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Foreign Goods Entering Hong Kong; Exceptions Made for Goods Benefiting Hong Kong's Recovery</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 12th] Following the government's recent revision of the method for allocating US and Philippine currency, trade between Hong Kong and the US, Canada, the Philippines, and other US dollar bloc countries is set to face further setbacks. The Hong Kong government has also indirectly informed importers that applications for importing non-essential goods will not be accepted. The quantity of US, Philippine, and Canadian foreign exchange that the Hong Kong government plans to allocate between June 21st and December 12th, 1947, is approximately the same as during the same period last year. The Hong Kong government will notify applicant importers in advance of the amount of foreign exchange they can expect to receive, so they can arrange orders accordingly. When applying for foreign exchange, importers must report to the supply department the quantity of imported goods, the amount of US dollars required, the quantity and value of such goods imported in any pre-war year, and a list of established US or Canadian agents. If the importing firm is newly established in Hong Kong after the war, they must also state the date of registration, the amount of capital, and the list of agents. Upon careful examination, the list of imported goods eligible for US dollar allocation excludes purely luxury items, such as nylon stockings and fountain pens. The government has indicated its hope to increase the number of items listed, to include certain other goods needed by Hong Kong itself. However, it has also stated that importers should refrain from applying if they cannot provide strong reasons for needing to import such goods. The list of imported goods eligible for US dollar allocation is divided into two categories, based on their effectiveness in revitalizing Hong Kong. Category A: Building materials, timber, sanitary equipment, mechanical engines, machine tools, tinplate, electric wires, steel, steel pipes, auto parts, tires, (new) refrigeration equipment, electric fans, mineral oil, wax and petroleum products, vegetable oil and fats, woolen yarn and rubber, office machinery and equipment, typewriters, calculators, cash registers, filing cabinets, pigments and dyes, industrial and manufactured chemicals, manufactured tobacco leaves, pharmaceuticals and toiletries, razor blades, paper, ink, books and magazines, photographic film, motion pictures and rented motion pictures, piece goods, manufactured clothing, various vegetable oils, grains, fresh fruit, canned fruit, and dried goods. Category B: Cars and trucks, radios, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, watches, coffee, beverages (beer).</p>
<p>Although the government's new system restricts the types of imported goods eligible for US dollar allocation, some merchants believe this is a necessary measure given the shortage of US dollars. The shortage of US dollars is partly due to exporters' unwillingness to sell US dollars to the government, instead trading them on the black market. Although the export of US currency or New York drafts is prohibited, there are still many loopholes. For example, although US currency or drafts cannot be exported via postal delivery, the government has no authority to inspect mail. Therefore, private remittances are difficult to prevent. Observers predict that after the implementation of the new measures, the demand for US dollars will decrease, while the market prices of luxury goods will likely increase.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Flour Rationing Price</h3>
<p>Flour Price at 78,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Various flour mills in the city have stated that the current flour rationing price is far below cost, making it difficult to avoid losses, and have requested an adjustment to the rationing price. Flour merchants have also requested an adjustment to their profit margins, due to the rising costs of various expenses. It is understood that the rationing price and sales price of flour have been approved by Mayor Wu, and are generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) 50-pound bag of foreign flour: rationing price of 75,500 yuan, profit of 4,000 yuan, transportation fee of 800 yuan, sales price of 80,300 yuan. (2) 70-pound bag of foreign flour: rationing price of 105,700 yuan, profit of 6,000 yuan, transportation fee of 1,200 yuan, sales price of 112,900 yuan. (3) 100-pound bag of foreign flour: rationing price of 151,000 yuan, profit of 8,000 yuan, transportation fee of 1,600 yuan, sales price of 160,600 yuan. (4) Bag of local flour: rationing price of 72,000 yuan, profit of 4,000 yuan, transportation fee of 780 yuan, factory tax of 1,000 yuan, stamp tax of 220 yuan, sales price of 78,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market for foreign firms: the process remained lackluster, with green tea buyers taking a wait-and-see approach, and sentiment remaining weak. As for various types of domestically sold tea, the amount entering and leaving the market was still similar, and the market remained stable. It is understood that new tea from various producing areas is being actively produced, but ultimately, the prices are surprisingly high, with few seekers, and the market is unusually quiet. It is also understood that pearl jasmine tea and Anhui baked green tea are being accepted by Tianjin merchants regardless of price, but the market supply is thin, making it difficult to fulfill demand. The market price remains stable.</p>
<h3>Upholding the Goal of Supporting Industry and Commerce: Lending Rates Will Not Be Increased</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen cooperation and connections with commercial banks and businesses, assist production enterprises, and encourage the circulation of daily necessities and export goods, the Central Bank has established a Discount and Lending Committee to handle applications from commercial banks and businesses for rediscounting, re-pledging, and re-discounting export bills. The discount and lending measures are being actively promoted. Many commercial banks and businesses believe that the interest rates set by the national bank are too low to cover expenses, and hope for an increase. According to a responsible person at the national bank: the discount and lending measures are intended to support production enterprises and the export of goods, to reduce the burden on manufacturers and exporters, and to achieve the goal of reducing costs, so it is necessary to provide low-interest loans. If the interest rate were to be increased, the original intention would be lost, and the burden on manufacturers and exporters would be increased, leading to renewed oppression by high-interest loans. There is no reason to increase the interest rate. Furthermore, commercial banks and businesses themselves only provide 20% of the loan amount, while the interest on rediscounting, re-pledging, and re-discounting export bills is calculated at half the original interest rate. The interest earned is already considerable, and should be sufficient to cover the expenses of each bank and business. Regarding the cumbersome application procedures, the responsible person said that efforts are being made to improve the procedures if they are beneficial to borrowers. After the application is submitted, a meeting is held to review and approve the loan. In view of China's circumstances, this is already extremely convenient.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau's Economic Division Investigates the Account Books of Five Sugar Merchants; Taiwan Sugar Corporation Official Discusses Sugar Rationing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Police Bureau's Economic Division recently received a report stating that certain sugar merchants have connections with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, resulting in a larger allocation of sugar each period compared to ordinary sugar merchants, and that some of the sugar is suspected of being resold on the black market. The bureau, together with personnel from the municipal government's Investigation Office, dispatched investigators and first reviewed the account books of five companies with the largest allocation quantities each time: Yonghe (No. 1, Xingye Lane, Sichuan South Road), Mao Taiheng (No. 4, China General Chamber of Commerce Building, Shiliupu), Qianyi (No. 172, Julu Road), Zhongyi (No. 19, Fengjing Road), and Zhongxing (No. A5, Xinyongan Street). It is reported that Yonghe's allocation quantity each time is 810 bags, and the others are slightly reduced from this amount.</p>
<p>Another report: A responsible person from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation yesterday gave a statement to reporters regarding the actual situation of sugar rationing by the company this year: He stated that the company has distributed sugar for a total of fourteen periods since January of this year. Starting from the fifth period, financial fluctuations and soaring prices led to fluctuations in the sugar market, and the application quantity for one period reached 138,000 bags. The price of sugar fluctuated again in the eighth period, so the average allocation quantity from the fifth, sixth, and seventh periods was used as the basis for rationing. The ninth to thirteenth periods were rationed according to the eighth period's method.</p>
<p>The fourteenth period, which has recently resumed rationing, saw a total application quantity from sugar merchants of 175,000 bags, breaking the record for past application quantities. The large amount made it impossible for the company to ration according to the applications. Therefore, the allocation quantity for the first to thirteenth periods was added to the application quantity for the fourteenth period, and then divided by fourteen, with sugar merchants being allocated according to the resulting average. The highest allocation quantity in this period was 500 bags. Even if the merchant's average allocation quantity exceeded 500 bags, they could only be allocated 500 bags, to show restriction. The company has detailed records of the quantity of sugar distributed each time, and the sugar merchants who received the allocations.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw prices soften as rationed goods could be released today, and credit was tight. Peruvian fine granulated sugar initially sold for 425,000 yuan, then 418,000 yuan, a decrease of over 20,000 yuan. 24 coarse white sugar sold for 450,000 yuan, a decrease of 230,000 yuan. 20 medium granulated sugar sold for 420,000 yuan, a small decrease of 15,000 yuan. Shantou green sugar sold for 275,000 yuan, a small decrease of 5,000 yuan. Shunde green sugar sold for 265,000 yuan, unchanged. Chaozhou green sugar was quoted at the original price, but no transactions occurred. Xinghua white sugar sold for 400,500 yuan to 405,000 yuan, a small decrease of 10,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar sold for 300,000 yuan to 310,000 yuan, unchanged.</p>

<h3>Rebuilding the Canal Dyke in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Zhenjiang, 7th (Express Dispatch) This Newspaper Reporter He Xianglin</p>
<p>In Northern Jiangsu, on this vast plain, to this day, no one believes that it remains so complex. In every corner, there still lurk many disasters and hardships, poverty, displacement, and a desolate scene of abandoned fields. Especially recently, after the fierce destruction and intrusions by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>To coordinate with this work, the Su-Ning Sub-District has allocated 9,100 tons of flour and 3.4 billion in cash allocated by the central government, using a work-relief approach to repair the canal project in Northern Jiangsu. This is the lifeline of the people of Northern Jiangsu, the hope for the lives and property of eight million people.</p>
<p>Currently, one-third of the work to repair the riverbanks and restore the dikes of the Jiangbei Canal and Yi-Jiu River has been completed. The sub-district specially invited a group of reporters from Zhenjiang and Shanghai to visit.</p>
<p>Lifeline for Eight Million People</p>
<p>On May 1st, we boarded a special boat into the Guazhou entrance. Stone embankment walls were visible on both sides. However, this is a secondary project. Nevertheless, a total of 16,000 cubic meters of stone have been used to repair the 18 li section from Guazhou to Yangzi Bridge on both sides. At the culvert entrances, water-lifting vehicles were already pumping water.</p>
<p>The most important project on the Liji River is from Shaobo to Huaiyin. Due to the rain and wet roads, we could not proceed, so we stopped in Yangzhou. Before conducting an on-site inspection, the river engineering authorities provided a general report on the condition of the canal and the entire project.</p>
<p>The only natural disaster in Northern Jiangsu is the breaching of the canal. Its cause is due to the changes in the Yellow River. Historically, the Yellow River has changed its course six times. In 1495 AD, the Yellow River breached in Wuyang and other counties, diverted through Xuzhou, and entered the sea via the Huai River and the canal. This was the fifth major diversion. By the sixth major diversion, in the fifth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, the river breached at Tongwaxiang, diverted into the Bohai Sea through the Daqing River. As a result, the former course was silted up by the sediment carried by the river, causing the entrance of the Huai River into the sea to be submerged. Therefore, the entire Huai River flows into Hongze Lake, and then is discharged into the canal through Baoying, Gaoyou, Shaobo, and other lakes, and then enters the Yangtze River. However, the lake water is higher than the canal. Therefore, it depends on the barriers on the east and west banks. If the dikes are not carefully maintained during the autumn floods, they will collapse. At the same time, the maximum total flow from Hongze Lake is 15,000 cubic meters per second, while the maximum total flow of the dams entering the Yangtze River is 8,333 cubic meters per second, and the maximum total flow of the old sea dams is 4,633 cubic meters per second, totaling only slightly more than 80% of the outflow from Hongze Lake. Therefore, the problem with the canal lies in the Huai River. The fundamental solution lies in diverting the Huai River. However, the project to divert the Huai River is quite arduous, and it is difficult to determine when it can be completed. Therefore, the dikes on both sides of the canal remain the lifeline for the lives and property of eight million people.</p>
<p>The canal within the province, from Huanglinzhuang on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong to Yangzhuang in Huaiyin County, is the Middle Canal, with a length of 344 li. From south of Huaiyin County to Guazhou in Jiangdu County, it is 340 li long and is the Inner Canal. The Middle Canal is harmed by the Yishu River water flowing south from Shandong Province. The Inner Canal is harmed by the Huai River flowing west from Henan and Anhui provinces. When the Yishu River and other rivers swell, the Middle Canal's dikes will overflow and breach, causing disaster in Shao County, Suqian, Siyang, Shuyang, Lianshui, Guanyun, and Donghai counties. If the dikes of the Inner Canal are not maintained during the swelling of the Huai River, then Huaian, Baoying, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, Taixian, and Funing counties will be submerged, and the obstruction of the downstream flow of the Yishu River will cause Xu Hai and other counties to also suffer from submersion. The tragedy of the great flood in Jiangbei in 1931 saw 26 major breaches in the east and west dikes of the canal between Gaoyou County and Shaobo Town in Jiangdu County, over a length of 60 li. The water poured down like the Milky Way, pooling in Xinghua, Gaoyou, Dongtai, Taixian, Baoying, Jiangdu, Yancheng, Huaian, Funing, and other counties east of the canal, covering an area of 50,000 square li. The water depth was over a zhang (about 10 feet) in the deep areas and 6-7 chi (about 6-7 feet) in the shallow areas. The number of deaths was about 10,000, and the loss of property was over 200 million yuan in the currency of the time. Statistics show that there were 212 large and small breaches in the Middle and Inner Canals, with a total width of 5,632.7 zhang. The cost of repairing the dikes after the disaster was over 3 million yuan, and the value of the flour for the work-relief portion was not included, nor was the number of breaches and the cost of repairing the Yishu River included. It can be said that this was a comprehensive catastrophe in Jiangbei after the Yellow River moved north.</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance Against Japan began in 1937, the Huai River flooded every year, but fortunately, it did not cause a major disaster. However, the Yishu River tail-end area was always at risk of disaster, because the dikes were not strong. Every time the flood season came, the upstream water would cause floods. Especially last summer, there were over 50 breaches of varying sizes, and tens of millions of mu of farmland were submerged. The central government and the Jiangsu provincial government immediately began to work on the canal's dike restoration project. However, the area above Shaobo was still occupied by the Chinese Communist Party. Although representatives from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and relevant water conservancy agencies and local gentry, braved the dangers and repeatedly negotiated with the CCP regarding the method for carrying out the dike restoration project, they failed to reach a result due to deep-seated prejudices. It was not until the National Army advanced north and recovered Gaobao and Huai in October that the canal dike restoration project began, planned, and implemented. The Executive Yuan's Water Conservancy Commission distributed the flour allocated by the UNRRA, and it was handed over to the Jiangsu Provincial Government after consultation with the Huai River Diversion Committee to establish the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, and the central government approved and allocated funds in stages. However, during the initial period of military stabilization, local order had not been fully restored, and the progress of the project was not easy. After much planning and overcoming obstacles, the canal dike officially started construction on January 30th of this year, and the Yishu River dike project began on March 24th of this year. It is estimated that from the start of construction to the end of April of this year, the average daily workforce was about 25,000 people, completing over 1.11 million cubic meters of earthwork. During this work, CCP elements often created rumors between Baoying and Huaiyin, attempting to obstruct the project, and even threatened laborers, preventing them from going to work. If the response was slightly inappropriate, not only would the workforce easily disperse, but the personnel involved in the work would also face unexpected disasters at any time. In February of this year, Zhang Xueli, the bao chief of the first bao in Dachi Township, Nanpingqiao Town, Huaian County, and Liu Xuebao, the household chief, were shot and killed by the CCP army for persuading laborers to work. However, this is their lifeline, how can they not work? In addition, the troops stationed mostly in towns and villages. In the countryside, the remnants of the CCP army would appear at night. The personnel stationed at the construction sites did not dare to sleep peacefully at night. Every time there was an alert, they would flee several times a night. We do not care about any party or any ideology, to win over the people, we must stabilize the people. The common people hate such worthless destruction and harassment.</p>
<p>The situation along the canal above Huaiyin is even worse. Taking the transportation of work supplies as an example, if it is not transported by car, there is a risk of being robbed. The work supplies in the Yishu River area are currently being transported from Xuzhou via the eastern section of the Longhai Railway to the nearby stations. However, due to transportation difficulties, only 600 bags have reached the destination. Therefore, it is not easy to coordinate the work and proceed.</p>
<p>In summary, the Northern Jiangsu Canal project is supplied with materials by the sub-district, cash by the central government, and managed by the Huai River Diversion Committee's Canal Dyke Restoration Engineering Bureau. The former is responsible for repairing ship locks and culverts, and the latter is responsible for restoring the dikes. There are three main goals: flood control, navigation and irrigation, and water discharge. Currently, only the first item has been achieved and is about to be completed. The entire project requires 3,706,125 cubic meters of earthwork and 37,044 cubic meters of stonework. The approved amount of work supplies is 8,800 tons, and the work funds are over 2.1 billion yuan. The earthwork that has been completed is 800,000 cubic meters in the section of the Jiangbei Canal from Huaiyin to Shaobo, 150,000 cubic meters from Huaiyin to Huanglinzhuang, and 150,000 cubic meters in the Yishu River area. About 13,000 cubic meters of stone have been mined, and 5,800 cubic meters have been transported to the construction site. Construction has now begun at Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Baoying, and is expected to be completed by the end of June of this year.</p>
<p>The reporter group arrived in Yangzhou on May 2nd. We originally planned to rush to Shaobo in the afternoon, but the weather did not cooperate. The rain continued. At 7:00 a.m. the next morning, before having breakfast, we set off and traveled by car to Shaobo. On both sides of the highway, the fields were flat, and the wheat had already ripened. However, the natural disasters and man-made disasters over the years have left the beautiful land full of wounds. After about an hour, we arrived in Shaobo Town. After a quick breakfast, we went to the dam.</p>
<p>Shaobo Lock — A Battlefield of Lament</p>
<p>We first went to the ship lock to see that it has now completely lost its effectiveness. It was also a victim of the CCP's unrest. Currently, ships need to change course and use a breach in the west dike upstream of the ship lock, temporarily using the lake surface as a waterway. The original building of the management office was completely destroyed by bombing, leaving only remnants. Other houses were also demolished, leaving only tiles and trenches crisscrossing, a sad sight. The remaining pillboxes are overgrown with weeds. The left gate upstream was hit by artillery shells, and the gear housing of the opening and closing mechanism of the small door on the left was also broken, and the spindle was bent and could not be used. The rocking car box had many bullet holes, and the gate could not be opened. The iron cover on the left bank upstream was damaged by hand grenades, and the traces remain. The above-water portion of the lock body is generally intact, only the concrete cover has a shell hole in the middle. Near the axis of the left-hand gate downstream, the reinforcing steel is exposed and the protective wood is completely damaged, also hit by artillery shells. In particular, the drawbridge has not been used for a long time and is now difficult to move. The character "lock" in the inscription "Shaobo Ship Lock" under the bridge was also damaged by artillery shells. This ship lock was completed in 1936, at a cost of over 700,000 yuan. It is 10 meters wide and 100 meters long, with a navigation depth of 2.5 meters, enough to accommodate one large ship of 900 tons or ten ships of 40 tons at a time. The maximum water level difference between upstream and downstream is 7.7 meters. The gate is made of steel, and the walls are made of reinforced concrete. The sides of the lock chamber are sloped with stone blocks, and the bottom of the lock is also paved with stone blocks. Such a great project was destroyed.</p>
<p>The broken car on the right gate was re-equipped during the enemy-puppet period, and the two small houses next to the gate were also built by the enemy-puppet regime, and some remnants still exist. This also seems to be a satire on reality. We visited this damaged ship lock, and we also saw the new battlefield where innocent people were killed. The only thought is that the Communist Party has let down the innocent people too much.</p>
<p>Active Projects Awaiting Development</p>
<p>The canal lock project started in 1933 and, by the winter of 1936, the navigation projects that had been completed included four ship locks: Shaobo Ship Lock, Gaoyou Ship Lock, Huaiyin Ship Lock, and Liujian Ship Lock. Regarding flood discharge, one Yangzhuang movable dam was completed, and the Huiji Lock near Huaiyin Lock was rebuilt into a new-style spillway lock to serve navigation and irrigation on the Inner Canal. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui were successively occupied. After eight years of disrepair, coupled with the CCP's attacks and expulsions, the project was destroyed and could not be used at all. The reporter only visited Shaobo Lock, and the damage was already significant. According to the report of the Huai River Committee's Canal Basin Dyke Restoration Engineering Bureau, the damage to other locks and dams is even more severe. For example, the Huaiyin Ship Lock has been almost completely destroyed. What currently stands in the river is like an abandoned lock left over from the past. When will the unfortunate damage be rebuilt? The Huai River Committee's Dyke Restoration Engineering Bureau has currently only done survey work and small-scale projects such as culverts. Even for the survey work, it can only be done on the water surface. The damage submerged in the water must be thoroughly inspected one by one after building water-retaining dikes upstream and downstream of each lock and dam and pumping water to remove sediment. A responsible person told reporters that this year's funding has been reduced from 29 billion to 7 billion after the economic emergency measures. This year, we can only afford to buy materials, and the lock repair project seems unlikely to be completed this year.</p>
<p>Continuing north from Shaobo, the highway is on top of the dike. Along the way, disaster relief teams organized by nearby villagers are transporting and compacting earth. The main project is to widen the dike body. In the past, the dike surface was only 3-4 zhang (about 30-40 feet) wide, but now it has been widened to 10 meters. In the past, only one car could travel on the dike surface, but now cars can drive straight through the repaired areas. In areas where the water turns sharply and the current rushes close to the bank, earthwork alone is not enough to ensure stability, so stone revetments are added to reinforce the bank. Currently, it is the dry season, and the river water is very shallow. Ships of 20 tons or more cannot pass, especially in the area from Mazha Bay to Fanshui, where the water depth is only 3 chi (about 3 feet). The reason is that the locks have collapsed and are not maintained, so the water level cannot be controlled. At the same time, due to the impact of the Yellow River floods, the river channel has gradually been silted up, increasing by an average of 6 cun (about 2 feet) in recent years. Therefore, dredging is also an urgent task.</p>
<p>Currently, the work being done is only dike restoration, which is a passive defense work. The active work of navigation, irrigation, and water discharge is awaiting development. In short, after the completion of the canal dike restoration project, it is determined that the water will no longer flood, so that the affected farmland can be restored to cultivation, and the area that can avoid flooding can reach 18 million mu. If the culverts and gates on the east and west dikes are repaired and completed, the 11 million mu of farmland in the Lixia River area will have no shortage of irrigation water, and accumulated water can be discharged through the culverts and gates. The reconstruction of the dams will ensure smooth navigation. This is the only requirement of the people of Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>— Chiayi, 4th (Airmail Report) Di Dong</p>
<p>Taiwan is our country's territory. In ancient times, it was the land of the Eastern Yi. After the Song and Yuan dynasties, more and more people from the mainland came here. After the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, it was occupied by the Japanese. After the victory, it returned to the embrace of the motherland. Reflecting on the past and present, I can't help but feel emotional. It is a small island with an area less than a quarter of Zhejiang Province. Its shape resembles a leaf. Mountains run across the north and south, forming the backbone of the island. The west is a plain, and the east coast has many mountains. The highest peak is the southern New High Mountain. Because of its unique advantages, coupled with the Japanese's 51 years of hard work, the plains have products such as rice, sugar cane, fruit, and camphor, while the mountains have famous timber such as red cypress.</p>
<p>Significant Progress in Transportation Infrastructure</p>
<p>Speaking of the transportation and construction industry here, it is indeed 20 to 30 years more advanced than in the mainland. For example, in terms of hydropower and roads, even in remote rural areas, there are urban sanitation facilities and bright electric lights. In terms of transportation, in addition to the 400-kilometer north-south railway stretching from Keelung in the north to Hengchun in the south, and the round-the-island railway from Keelung to Suao in the north and from Hualien to Taitung, the developed highways are not inferior to the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, which are known for their widespread road construction. Because the asphalt Class A highways winding through the countryside and the shuttling vehicles are surprising and pleasing to those who come to Taiwan. As for the usable airfields in the province, there were more than 70 during the Japanese occupation. In terms of maritime transportation, there are Keelung and Tamsui in the north, Kaohsiung and Gaoping in the south, and good harbors can be built in the east. No wonder the Japanese previously regarded Taiwan as the only base for attacking the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) and the mainland of our country.</p>
<h3>Visiting Fuxing Brick and Tile Factory</h3>
<p>— Nai Xin</p>
<p>Nanjing is a place I have visited before, a city of dignitaries and officials, with many grand residences and large gardens that retain their pre-war appearance. Zhongshan and Linggu Mountains maintain their beautiful scenery. Invited by Mr. Xu Lianxun, the manager of Fuxing Brick and Tile Factory, I visited the entire factory and felt it was worthwhile to introduce it to the public. I hereby record my observations as follows:</p>
<p>Fuxing Brick and Tile Factory was founded in April of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), only a year ago. At that time, the capital was two hundred million yuan, and it was a partnership. The office is located at No. 6 Baixia Road, and the factory is located at Badou, outside Heping Gate in Nanjing, about fourteen kilometers from the city. It occupies an area of ​​more than one hundred acres, with several factory buildings built among the mountains. The earthen kilns stand in rows, already displaying the two colors of brick and tile, red and gray, covering the mountains and plains, creating a spectacular sight. Facing a tributary of the Yangtze River and surrounded by mountains and water, the scenery is serene and beautiful. Cars can directly reach this place, making transportation quite convenient.</p>
<p>Most of the Workers Were Once Soldiers</p>
<p>The hundreds of workers mostly come from the provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. They had served on the battlefield during the Anti-Japanese War. After being discharged, they could not return home and changed their occupation to become workers. Most of them are bachelors, but some have brought their families to live together. Food and lodging are provided by the factory, with three meals a day, rarely containing meat. When we visited each place, it was lunchtime. Groups of three or five sat on the ground, eating white rice and garlic with relish. Apart from working, eating, and sleeping, they have no entertainment. They live in the mountains all year round, unaware of the changes in the world. The work is entirely based on a contract system, with a foreman managing each group. Wages depend on work experience, ranging from tens of thousands to three or four hundred thousand per month, but they are not paid monthly, only settled during the three major festivals, with only some pocket money provided during normal times.</p>
<p>Each Brick and Tile Represents Hardship</p>
<p>The production of bricks and tiles takes about two weeks. First, the mud is mixed and formed into bricks, then placed on a large field to dry. After drying, they are moved into the earthen kilns, each kiln holding thirty to forty thousand bricks and tiles. They are fired with coal for up to ninety-six hours, day and night. The kiln workers take turns on duty. The kiln can only be opened one or two days after the fire is extinguished. When mature, they are red. To make blue-gray bricks and tiles, they must be watered for a day and a night. The biggest cost of making bricks and tiles is fuel.</p>
<p>Product Improvement Foundation Laid</p>
<p>The capital is in a period of reconstruction, and the housing shortage is particularly serious. Construction is a timely undertaking, and bricks and tiles are essential building materials. The factory's business development is expected. Production cannot meet demand, so the factory purchased a generator from General Electric in the United States last year and ordered various parts from Shanghai Dahua Iron Works. The installation has been completed, and mass production is now possible. After transitioning from manual earthen production to mechanized production, the products are becoming more refined. Business is booming every month, and there are still plans for improvement in the future. I visited the factory for several hours and deeply felt that although the factory was recently founded, it has already achieved such results. The foundation of the initial business has been laid here. This is due to manpower, materials, and opportunity, but it is also because all departments and personnel can work together and work hard.</p>

<h3>The French Epic After Zola</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>After Zola's masterpiece "Rougon-Macquart Cycle," another continuous epic has emerged in France today. This is Jules Romains' "Men of Good Will." The entire book consists of fourteen volumes, with the following table of contents: (1) Men of Good Will, (2) Passion's Pilgrims, (3) The Proud and the Meek (translated into English by Warre B. Wells), (4) The World from Below, (5) The Earth Trembles, (6) The Depths and the Heights, (7) Death of A World, (8) Verdun, (9) Aftermath, (10) The New Day, (11) Work and Play, (12) The Wind Is Raising, (13) Escape in Passion, (14) The Seventh of Octhober (all translated by Gerard Hopkins). It is said to be the most enduring work of modern fiction, synthesizing French social, political, and spiritual life, and discussing Europe as well. The time period is from October 6, 1908, to October 7, 1933.</p>
<p>Jules Romains has written many novels, plays, poems, and essays, which have influenced not only France but also Europe and the United States. The most famous of these is this great work "Men of Good Will," which he and critics alike acknowledge as his masterpiece. He first conceived of writing this work thirty years ago. Actual writing began in 1931. He said that all his works were merely preparations and exercises for this monumental work. He visited the United States in 1936 and again in 1939, staying at the PEN Club and delivering his famous wartime democracy speech. After the fall of France in 1940, Jules Romains lived in the United States and Mexico. He has now returned to France.</p>
<p>If you share the tumultuous and passionate life narrated by Jules Romains, you will see the shattering of the old world and the struggling growth of the new world; you will dream, doubt, and despair; you will experience many storms and dangers with the author; in the individual lives of over a thousand people, you will observe the astonishing drama of this era. This is Paris, this is France, this is Europe, this is our world, our time.</p>
<p>"No historian can write the history of 1918 to 1933 as profoundly as this," said biographer Andre Maurois. "Jules Romains seems better than anyone else, he writes about a small group of fortunate people who have pondered for a long time, thinking that they can rebuild Europe."</p>
<p>Jules Romains can be said to be of the Rabelais school. His style is fluent and imaginative. He approaches life with the attitude of an artist, and his literary interests are primarily aesthetic. He is a pillar of bourgeois culture. He considers himself to belong to the Balzac and Zola category.</p>
<p>This great work is progressing slowly. Many characters take little action, but merely express the author's opinions on literature, sex, ethics, and so on. The two main characters are actually Jules Romains himself. Pierre Jallez is introspective, poetic, and sensitive, while Jean Jerphanion is objective, normal, and skeptical. His "Verdun" is the best of these novels. For example, he writes: the birth of a baby; a poor child playing with an iron hoop, dreaming of life; the people of Paris awakening on a beautiful morning, with majestic cries opposing the bestiality of the First World War.</p>
<h3>Mountain City Sentiments</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>Fried Rice Candy Water</p>
<p>At night, although the roads in the mountain city are quiet, there are always some pedestrians walking around. After twelve o'clock, the theater closed, and the audience went to restaurants specializing in the night market to have a "midnight snack" before going home to sleep, which was at least one o'clock the next morning. After two o'clock, pig herders shouted as they drove their pigs into the slaughterhouse. The fog enveloped the streetlights, blurring the figures. The watchman knocked on bamboo clappers, but the vendors selling "fried rice candy water" were still wandering the streets, calling out in long voices. Gamblers, opium smokers, and poor intellectuals, all those with a "nightlife," needed this square piece of fried rice candy in hot water, warm and sweet, to relieve their hunger and cold in the deep night. Those who were a bit wealthier would add one or two eggs, which was also delicious. Because it was late at night and nothing else was available, "fried rice candy water" became the only precious item.</p>
<p>The night deepened, and the sky gradually brightened. After three o'clock, those rushing to catch the steamboat, carrying vegetables, and transporting goods took advantage of the sparse crowds and good roads at midnight to rush to work. In the hearts of these laborers, there was already a "daylight saving time," so the "eating market" in the second half of the night was even more lively. At the dock, there were always soy milk, fried dough sticks, and fermented rice wine eggs. Also, there was a "wonton stall" that opened from six in the evening until dawn. Their lives were "night as day, day as night!"</p>
<p>Life is like competing ships, just like the turbulent flow of the Jialing River. In the twenty-four-hour cycle of day and night, people competing for a living must seize every minute. Naturally, this tense and exhausting competition often makes people feel breathless under pressure. If you don't believe me, listen to the long cries in the deep alleys when the night is quiet and people are asleep—"fried rice—candy—water"—you can feel the poignant and resentful emotions.</p>
<p>Telling Tall Tales</p>
<p>Why is "chatting" called "telling a dragon gate formation"? Excuse me, I have not "traced its origin," but this phrase shows how much the people of Sichuan love a leisurely life. In Chongqing, you can see many teahouses, and they are always full of people. These people naturally come to "tell dragon gate formations." People who come to the mountain city for the first time are not used to it, but after living there for a long time, everyone becomes accustomed to "hanging out in teahouses." Even now that we have returned to Jiangnan, we still feel the inconvenience of not having so many teahouses.</p>
<p>Once, in Shanhui, I saw an advanced woman shouting loudly to the people sitting in the teahouse in a marching parade: "Fellow countrymen who are living in a drunken dream, the Japanese devils are going to destroy our country, stop hanging out in teahouses!" But the people leaning on the railings watching the parade looked at her indifferently. Everyone continued to eat melon seeds, smoke leaf cigarettes, read newspapers, and chat, some even discussing business.</p>
<p>After living in Sichuan for a long time, I learned that every town and city has teahouses, and they serve various functions.</p>
<p>Teahouses are usually related to the "Gelaohui" (Brotherhood Society), each "hall" (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith). There are managers and heads of households who act as gathering places for the "brothers" every day to "meet" and discuss business. Some teahouses become gathering places for various commercial guilds to inquire about market conditions. Whenever there is a "market fair," the people in the teahouse temporarily have a natural classification! Therefore, the side effect of the teahouse is that it is set up for people who "go to the fair" to trade and rest, so it has a great relationship with the rural socio-economy and should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Tea brewing includes Dafang, Longjing, Tuocha, chrysanthemum, and so-called "two openings" and "glass." "Two openings" means half tea leaves and half chrysanthemum, and "glass" means "plain water," which is the benefit of the waiter, and the owner does not charge. Ordinary tea is calculated by the number of bowls based on the number of small boxes of tea leaves, so sometimes the waiters brew two boxes evenly into three boxes to profit from it. In Chongqing, because people's lives are hard and housing is poor, many people, especially friends in the cultural circles, get up in the morning and go to the teahouse to wash their faces, brew tea, eat breakfast, read books, and write articles until they go back to the office or home for lunch at noon; they go again in the afternoon. There are many people who use teahouses as temporary offices, liaison offices, and workplaces. However, this kind of teahouse is relatively upscale, like the teahouse in Chongqing Zhongshan Park, where there are newspaper sellers, shoe shiners, and people selling fountain pens and telling fortunes.</p>
<p>The only temptation when sitting in a teahouse is the melon seeds placed on the table. Once you start eating, you eat one plate after another, and the waiter will bring up one plate after another, because this is his special benefit.</p>
<p>In the mountain city, there are often power outages and water outages, so teahouses often grab water and increase tea prices. In summer, water is even more precious; sometimes, when the water is cut off, the teahouse will close down.</p>
<p>The teahouse is a good place to tell dragon gate formations and is also the most economical place to pass the time. At first glance, it doesn't seem that way; after a long time, you deeply feel the convenience of the teahouse. After the restoration, in the "theater teahouse" in Beijing and Shanghai, a cup of tea costs seven or eight thousand yuan, which really makes people recall the cheapness of the mountain city teahouse; thinking about the comfortable state of lying on a bamboo chair in the mountain city teahouse, I still can't help but "yearn for it"!</p>
<p>The Sentiment of Wine</p>
<p>During the war, alcohol was prohibited in the mountain city, and restaurants were not allowed to play guessing games and drink, but some people still used tea bowls to hold wine and spoons instead of cups to drink it sip by sip. When the "inspection team" came, the lid was placed on the tea bowl and placed in front of someone as if nothing had happened, leaving no trace. At the same time, it was stipulated that liquor stores selling cold liquor could only sell peanuts and dried tea, not cooked dishes, so "cold liquor stores" were popular for a while. Sichuanese people do not like to drink yellow wine, and "white liquor" and "large noodles" are the most popular. Selling wine is based on the number of cups, and two or three confidants can chat while drinking and still get drunk.</p>
<p>Except for Chengdu and Chongqing, the counties in Sichuan do not prohibit alcohol. The host considers "encouraging drinking" (meaning using methods to persuade people to drink) as a skill, and many of us have been "trapped." Therefore, those who are clever never start drinking before a banquet, otherwise, if they "make an exception" once, then they will concentrate their attack, and the result is "no return without getting drunk." Therefore, those in Sichuan with a large capacity for alcohol often have nicknames such as "drunk for seven days," "drunkard," and "never wakes up from being drunk."</p>
<p>In winter, the fog enveloped the mountain city, and the hazy night scene, seen through eyes with a bit of drunkenness, was particularly mysterious. In the past, I loved the streetlights of Avenue Joffre in Shanghai, but in the past ten years, I have loved the wine atmosphere of the mountain city even more!</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 507</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Today's situation is completely different from the above. Although the actions of the person knocking on the door were so mysterious, when you met, seeing her so innocent and frank, it seemed that there was nothing mysterious at all. How could you know that she was not young and timid, and afraid to be bold? If you wanted to say that she was acting with hostility, looking at her face full of childishness, smiling, and polite; her simple summer clothes, with her arms exposed, unless you had seen a time bomb planted in advance, you couldn't even see a hairpin. Not to mention pistols, electric knives, or swords, you couldn't find a trace of hostility no matter what.</p>
<p>Neither particularly mysterious nor hostile, but coming so suddenly, laughing and playful, and also a woman, so Hejian was stunned for a moment and couldn't get rid of her; besides an "oh," there was nothing more. At the same time, Hejian's heart full of distress and anxiety on this day was also the biggest factor that froze him in front of this woman.</p>
<p>"Really taking the liberty, Mr. Gu!" When the woman saw Hejian standing there dumbfounded, she spoke again, and the three words "zhuluomi" suddenly changed to a "Gu" character. This change of address showed that her attitude was slightly more serious than before, and also showed that she was very familiar with Hejian's past: "I heard that I have an older brother who came here to talk to you, sir. I have a small matter to find him at this time, but I don't know that he has already... I don't know him... I guess he... I heard that he... maybe he will come again..."</p>
<p>This role is simply making trouble, isn't it? First of all, since she has taken the liberty to break into the place of someone she has never met before, according to normal logic, she should explain in one breath "My name is what, who is my older brother..." Introduce herself so that people can understand what is going on. Second, especially making trouble: her last half sentence turned three or four turns when she said it; at one point, it seemed that she was saying that her brother "has already..." Presumably, it was always "has already gone;" at another point, she wanted to say "I don't know him..." Presumably, it was "I don't know that he has already left." At one point, it seemed that she was saying "I guess he..." Perhaps she was saying "I guess he will come again..." At one point, she said "Maybe he will come again..."</p>
<p>Although her second half of the sentence turned three or four times, it clearly proved that this role was a big liar; because her words didn't match each other; she said that her brother "came here... to talk," listening to her tone, it was clear that she already knew that her brother had left, if he hadn't left, where did she hear these words from? Isn't that right? But then she said that she "didn't know that he had already left..." When she said it, she felt that this was inappropriate, so she quickly turned her tone three times. However, from these two sentences, it can be proved that this role does not have any great talent for lying. Because the biggest secret of a true lying expert is to speak "definitely": what is yin is yin, what is mao is mao, and you must not waver so that the listener has half a doubt.</p>
<p>Her words turned three times, even Hejian, whose thoughts were as chaotic as hemp, could hear the problem:</p>
<p>"Miss, what is your honorable surname?... Who is your older brother?..."</p>
<p>Hejian's question was extremely reasonable; no matter who, where, or when, if you meet someone you don't know and hear the other person say that, of course, you would ask this question. At the same time, Hejian's question was of course an opening statement. In theory, after Hejian asked this, the other person should state their name grandly, and explain who the "older brother" is, and return to her maiden home, which would be reasonable. Guess how she answered after hearing Hejian's question?</p>
<h3>A Passive View of Occupation</h3>
<p>— Bali</p>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a short article on "Occupational Mood," mentioning that young friends today generally hold a low and detached mood. This mood is expanding as the days become more difficult, which is a serious impression.</p>
<p>Today, every employee seems to be annoyed, annoyed by the heavy workload, annoyed by insufficient learning, and even more annoyed by meager treatment. However, despite the annoyance, they can only stubbornly stick to it. Because industry and commerce are declining, it is not easy to maintain the status quo, let alone expand. Therefore, there are plans to lay off employees and reduce salaries, trying to reduce the number of employees. Even if one person is employed, they are given double or triple the amount of work as before. Therefore, as an employee, a sense of unease and dissatisfaction with the occupation arises. But what can you do? So, they just go through the motions, generating a "muddling through" concept.</p>
<p>Originally, occupation should be the combination of ideal and practice. Dedicating oneself to an occupation means preparing to develop oneself and achieve one's ideals on this path. However, in today's difficult times, the pursuit of occupation cannot follow one's own wishes, and fully seeking employment is just a saying and a theory. Therefore, one can only try one's luck, seize an opportunity, and treat "a branch to perch on" as just a means to earn a living.</p>
<p>If one only regards occupation as a means to earn a living, this not only destroys the deep meaning of occupation but also loses a sense of enthusiasm and interest in employment. Therefore, the view of occupation is very passive. One only seeks to survive temporarily, without long-term plans, and naturally there is no ideal to speak of. And the mood toward occupation is not boredom or resentment, but a nonchalant attitude, treating it as a chicken rib.</p>
<p>This passive view of occupation not only affects the employee's will to live, but also affects the progress of construction if the country is at peace. Fortunately, this concept arises under unstable circumstances. If the social environment can reach the stage of free choice of occupation and full employment, this passive concept may be completely eliminated. However, today, according to the China Vocational Education Society, the employment rate is as low as 14 percent, which means that only 14 out of 100 people seeking employment get a job, which shows how bad the employment situation is today. But we must not lose hope, just like the general employees who muddle through with a passive concept, we always hope that there will be a day of peace and construction.</p>

<h3>Listening to the Ministry of Education Symphony Orchestra</h3>
<p>— Xin Geng</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's China Symphony Orchestra has recently started performing in Nanjing. They hold a weekly concert at the Xindu Theater every Sunday, performing some famous pieces.</p>
<p>This orchestra is quite well-organized, with more than 30 musicians, conducted by Lin Shengxi. Some of the musicians are former members of the Sun Yat-sen University Orchestra, and of course, there are quite a few talented players.</p>
<p>Today is the fifth weekly concert in their spring season. I listened to it once. There were six programs in total. The first was Beethoven's "Prometheus" Overture, followed by "Minuet," "Hungarian Dance No. 2 and No. 7," and "Barcarolle," etc. The last one was Beethoven's "Eroica Symphony." Although their ability is not enough to play these quite heavy pieces (especially the "Eroica Symphony"), they have done their best.</p>
<p>The "Prometheus" Overture was performed very solemnly. The first few short, sharp chords immediately drew the audience's attention and added a lot of solemn atmosphere to the venue. Then, the music gradually calmed down, allowing the audience to relax their spirits slightly in order to continue listening to these beautiful movements.</p>
<p>"Minuet" is a lively piece that controlled the lively atmosphere of the entire venue. Then, "Hungarian Dance No. 2" was steady and powerful, and then "Hungarian Dance No. 7" returned to a relaxed mood. The atmosphere was always changing like this.</p>
<p>After a fifteen-minute break, the "grand finale" of the "Eroica Symphony" (Beethoven's Third Symphony) began. It was divided into four movements. The first movement was fast and brilliant, the second movement was a funeral march, which was more solemn, the third movement was a scherzo, and the fourth movement was the finale. In this symphony, the orchestra fully demonstrated their efforts. Conductor Lin Shengxi is a famous musician in China. His hands and facial expressions fully expressed the joys, sorrows, and joys in the music, deeply moving the audience. When the piece ended, Mr. Lin also breathed a sigh of relief as if he had unloaded a heavy burden, and he was already sweating profusely.</p>
<p>The only large orchestra in China is the Shanghai Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra, but most of them are foreign musicians. The China Symphony Orchestra is probably the only purely Chinese orchestra. Chinese music is backward, and we hope that these two orchestras will continue to grow and work hard to win a breath for the Chinese music scene.</p>
<h3>News Digest</h3>
<p>— Tie Yun</p>
<p>We believe that rice merchants certainly have their difficulties, but using radio broadcasts or newspaper reports as justification for resorting to violence is not a method that rice merchants should adopt. If everything is resolved through "force," all criticism and public opinion will be silenced, allowing "dictatorship" to reign supreme.</p>
<p>The masses may indeed be blind, but those who lead them must take full responsibility. We cannot attribute everything to "popular anger."</p>
<p>Stabilizing the rice market still relies on stabilizing prices and maintaining the currency's stability. When prices are stable, everything can be resolved smoothly.</p>
<p>The actress Ying Zi has passed away, which is merely a reflection of the "end" for all film and theater professionals. How many film and theater professionals or cultural workers live and die well? Frankly, to cultivate the nation's vitality, we must treat cultural workers with greater generosity.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a grand plan for a New Shanghai, which included building the Shanghai Municipal Government and various bureaus' offices in the city center. However, the city center is quite desolate now. Given Shanghai's dense population, why not move the municipal government to the city center?</p>
<p>One evening, I overheard two people in uniform on duty discussing Shanghai's roads. They praised the former Shanghai Municipal Council's conscientious road construction but shook their heads at the current sloppy road repairs. We don't know the truth, but locally, the roads are full of scars, with uneven surfaces. Is this because there is not enough funding for road repairs?</p>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"Returning Home in Glory"</h3>
<p>— Wu Bian</p>
<p>"Returning Home in Glory" depicts a young teacher, Lin Daojun, who resolutely leaves his wife, children, and friends to participate in war zone work after the "August 13th Incident" (the start of the Battle of Shanghai). He serves on the front lines but cannot endure the harsh life of the war zone. He flees to the rear in Chongqing, changes his profession to business, and unexpectedly becomes wealthy, transforming into a minor official-merchant figure. After the victory, he returns to Shanghai as a receiver of assets, "returning home in glory." He inevitably seeks stimulation in dance halls, resulting in a relationship with his daughter—his daughter is forced into a life of embracing in dance halls due to factory closures. The story ends with his wife's death, his daughter's departure, and himself suffering the condemnation of his conscience in the snow. This is a tragic ethical drama. The author vigorously chastises the intellectuals who wavered during the war of resistance. He also strips away the facade of those receivers of assets and official-merchant figures, exposing their inner ugliness, allowing people to see how shameless and pathetic these returning home in glory individuals are. This is the author's accusation of justice.</p>
<p>However, the author attributes Lin Daojun's wavering during the war of resistance solely to his weak character and inability to endure hardship, neglecting the objective reasons of society. This is an error due to the author's lack of deep understanding of reality. Furthermore, it is unreasonable that Xiao Ling and Lin Daojun, being in love, fail to recognize Lin as her father, while Lin's wife, following Xiao Ling and Daojun's rendezvous, can recognize her husband of eight years with just a glance through the glass window, especially since Xiao Ling's home has enlarged photos of her parents. Lin Daojun does not change much in the eight years on the screen.</p>
<p>Moreover, after the victory, there were many tragic stories of separation and reunion that could be written, but the author focuses on the love between father and daughter. This tendency toward a perverted psychology is precisely the author's vulgarity.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Zhao Dan, as a new director, is quite successful. He handles the entire play in a simple and realistic manner, without vulgar gimmicks, which is commendable. The only flaw is the sloppiness in the connection between scenes. If this film could be edited more tightly, this flaw could be remedied. Finally, the scene where Lin Daojun returns to the empty house and suffers the condemnation of his conscience after his wife's death and daughter's departure is an unnecessary tail. If it could be deleted, the story would end more forcefully and cleanly.</p>
<p>Gu Eryi's Lin Daojun is better in the later scenes than in the earlier ones. His status and demeanor are very fitting, and his physical appearance helps him. Tan Ying's Xu Hui is very hardworking but unremarkable. In terms of makeup, she should have been made to look older to match her difficult life. Zhang Yan's rickshaw puller has a very likable role, but his performance is just average. Sun Xia's Li Jiacheng is still steady, while Xu Zuoqi's Xiao Ling's expression is very stiff, perhaps because it is her first time on camera and she is nervous. It is worth mentioning that the pair of young actors, Ye Xiaokeng and Yu Fuying, especially the former, have more lively and natural acting skills.</p>
<p>Although this film has script defects, the overall performance is still a passable film and is worth introducing to audiences who care about domestic films.</p>
<h3>Copper Buttons</h3>
<p>— Hong Tao</p>
<p>Officials of the late Qing Dynasty wore mandarin jackets for formal occasions and overcoats for casual wear, both with copper buttons down the front, arranged like cherries. Today, the mandarin jacket is still used as formal attire, but the buttons have evolved from copper buttons into elaborate sets of buttons. However, the origins of the copper button system are unknown. When I asked the elders, I learned that this system began in the Yongzheng era. Emperor Yongzheng, having gained the throne through usurpation, was extremely suspicious. At that time, heroes of the common people who had not forgotten the Ming Dynasty still posed a threat of resurgence. Even the emperor's relatives were all eager to get rid of him. Therefore, the emperor recruited martial arts experts to attend him daily to prevent unforeseen events. One day, during a court assembly, someone suddenly jumped down from the corner of the wall of the palace. The courtiers all looked at each other in dismay. Later, it was learned that an assassin had been lurking in the corner of the house, trying to snipe the emperor. No one else had noticed, but a Han censor caught a glimpse of it. The censor was known for his skill in shooting pellets. However, in the rush, he did not have time to draw an arrow, and the emperor was still on the throne; suddenly using force might alert the assassin and allow him to escape, leaving no proof and incurring the charge of disrespect. Therefore, the censor plucked a button from his mandarin jacket and struck the assassin's eyes. The assassin, in pain, fell to the ground, still clutching a dagger, which was shiny and less than a foot long, its edge menacing. Upon interrogation, he confessed to being an assassin. From then on, the double-breasted copper button was established as the censor's regular uniform. Over time, scholars and officials all imitated it, and it became a custom, and no one could remember the story behind it anymore.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Director Hou, this is the car!" Director Xiong said with a beaming smile, pointing to the car towards the middle-aged man, "This car is relatively new. It will definitely not break down! Hahaha!"</p>
<p>"Haha...!" The middle-aged man echoed with an unnatural laugh.</p>
<p>"What? There's already someone on the driver's platform!" The female guest who came with him, Lao Mi, had already seen a plump woman sitting on the driver's platform of the car, so her face fell and she asked loudly.</p>
<p>This was obviously beyond Director Xiong's expectations. He turned around to take a closer look, and his face flushed with anger. The skinny driver actually heard that this group of people was coming, so his face was no better than Director Xiong's.</p>
<p>"Driver! Why did you let this woman sit here?" The young Director Xiong strode forward and said imposingly, "Tell her to get down! Get down immediately!"</p>
<p>The skinny driver did not speak, he felt a little hesitant. When the car is moving, the driver is above everything else. This is the iron rule forged on the highway over the past few years of the War of Resistance. What is Director Xiong? Why should he be afraid of him? However, now the car has not yet started, and his immediate superior—the company commander of the Ziqi × Regiment's × Company—is also here. Not taking this into account is obviously not going to work.</p>
<p>The company commander Liu was afraid that things would get out of hand, so he also came up.</p>
<p>He cleverly winked at the hesitant driver first, and then shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Deng Guozhong, tell that woman to get down! This is Director Hou and Mrs. Hou, introduced by Commander ×. You must give up this driver's seat! Did you hear that?"</p>
<p>The skinny Deng driver heard that it was such a big deal, and he felt half softened; however, the fat woman who had already gotten into the car was his patron, the one who spent money on him, so how could he ask her to get out of the car? (6) (9)</p>
