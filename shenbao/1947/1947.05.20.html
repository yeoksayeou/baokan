<h3>參政會大會今開幕　蔣主席將親臨致詞　下午張羣出席報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕國民參政第四屆第三次全體大會，廿日在京揭幕，上午十時舉行開會式，張伯苓任主席，于斌代表全體參政員致答詞。儀式簡單隆重，唱國歌，向國旗曁國父遺換行三鞠躬禮後，主席致詞，次中國府主席致詞，參政員致答詞，末奏樂禮成。下午三時起由張羣院長親自出席，向大會作政治報吿。據外交部息，廿日國民參政會舉行開慕典禮時，駐京各國外交團首長，將前往觀禮。</p>
<p>此次大會，爲勝利後第二次大會，爲還都後首次會，亦爲在京舉行之第一次。四屆第二次大會係卅五年三月廿日在渝舉行，距今一年兩個月，其間因國大之召開，國府之改組，以致一再延誤至今始克舉行。有謂此次會爲末次會者，惟根據半年一次會之規定，在行憲國大召開前，可能尙有最後一次會之召集。</p>
<p>大會日程預定兩週</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕參政會大會日程預定十四天（星期在內）廿日上午開會式，下午政治報告。廿一日上午財政報吿，下午社會及司法行政報吿。廿二日上午外交報吿，下午糧食及農林報吿。廿三日上午交通報吿，下午軍事·內政報吿。廿匹日上午敎育報吿，下午經濟·善後救濟服吿。廿五日星期休會。廿六日上下午審查會，廿七日上下午審查會，廿八日上午審查會，廿九日·卅日·卅一日三日大會，六月一日星期休曾，二日上午大會，下午休會式。又政院廿五日下午四時茶會招待參政員，蔣主席則定廿八日晚七時在勵志社招待。大會提案截至開幕前夕，各參政員尙無提出者。提案截止日期爲廿三日午。據聞：此次提案甚多，因各參政員均認此次大會爲最後一次會，咸欲有所表達，惟提案中心在於希望安定國是，即呼籲和平及穩定經濟兩項。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕參政員十九日報到五十六人，連前共計二四六人，滬錢永銘·胡霖·吳　初·王曉籟·均於十九日報到。此外，有黃炎培。鄭揆一·周謙冲·江恒源·端木愷·傅斯年·吳貽芳·胡健中·馬乘風·盧廣聲等。</p>
<p>〔本報桂林十九日電〕桂省參政員雷沛　等，今飛京出席參政會。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨參政員楊毓滋，萬仞千，馮今白等一行，昨夜搭車晋京，準備參加政會大會。張君勱在手績上已向大會報到，但因事留滬，一兩日內不能前往。可靠方面消息，民社黨在此次參政會中，決提出請求政府主動恢復和談之提案，其理由爲：內戰持久民不聊生，此時，甚望政府寬大爲懷，不間中共之反響如何，首先提出恢復和談，如此，則和平之恢復或有一綫希望。</p>
<h3>政治上求和平　經濟上求安定　錢永銘等談當前急務</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕社賢參政員錢永銘，頃與記者談和平問題時，認我國經八載抗戰之後，無異久病之身，恢復和平，實爲刻不容緩之事，自老百姓至政府，莫不人同此心，心同此理，深盼能早日重睹和平，希望共黨能開誠布公，從事談判。記者詢以共黨若堅持以前兩條件，將如之何？錢謂，共黨若不承認憲法，情勢當見困難，另一方面則政府威信亦不能不予顧及。錢氏對當前經濟問題之看法，爲目前經濟危機咸由心理恐慌引起，因之，當前最重要者爲如何使一切「安定」。錢氏認欲使法幣回籠，發行公債固爲一種辦法，然主要者仍爲如何增加生產，而增產之先決條件，又爲「安定」，故政浪上求和平，經濟上求安定，實爲當務之急。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕參政員王曉籟十九日接見本報記者，談當前和平及經濟問題時，深盼朝野咸能一本良心，爲國是前途努力。王氏鄭重指出，渠等早於去年即曾提出和平呼籲，惜當時未能引起廣大注意，時至今日，和平仍爲當務之急，應設法促其早日實現。而實現和平之最重要條件，即爲「大家能拿出良心來」。對當前經濟問題，王認其患在病重藥輕，就政府方面而論，最要者在求其能維持信用，過去失信於民這故事，不應再見於今日，外滙須來回管制，並應將申請外匯各戶名單公開，藉免爲少數人所操縱。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕民盟參政員黃炎培十九日晨抵京，即赴參政會報到，記者訪詢其對國是之意見，黃氏稱：本人此次來京，將與各方交換對於和平之意見，因和平爲人人所希望者，至其成果，則事在八爲，本人擬提出關於呼籲和平之方案，現尙視全體參政員之意見，同時研究謀取和平之方式，並視政府之態度而定。又參政員許德珩十九日竟日與各方接觸，研究呼籲和平之方式，待有所成就，即提具體方案，交參政會。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟主席張瀾，昨日接見記者時表示：民盟固已決定在參政會提議停戰及恢復和談，但詳細辦法尙待研究商定。自民國廿九年起，民盟即主張，欲解決我國內爭，唯有採「軍隊國家化，政治民主化」之送徑，至抗戰勝利時、又主張通過黨派會議，以謀國共團結，由各黨派從中協調監督。以上兩項主張，迄今一貫不變。</p>
<h3>統一憲法解釋</h3>
<p>憲政會研究委會通過</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕憲政實施促進會研究委會，十九日上午九時舉行第二次會，劉振東主席，通過：（一）關於聞揚憲法統一說明案，（二）各項選舉辦理情形（如選峯調查），各級選舉機構毅立情形及實施進度，應請政府隨時以書面告知本會，以利研破案。（三）請政府派各地選舉事務所人選，應以地方公正人士充任案。（四）各地政府辦理選舉經費，不得向民間攤派案。</p>
<h3>中央黨部紀念鵰　李敬齊報告地政</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕國民黨中央黨部十九日上午舉行總理紀念週，孫科主席，由地政部長李敬齋報告地政工作，分就整理地籍與土地政策兩項，作扼要說明，認爲我國地籍甚爲凌亂、全國已淸丈之土地，不過百分之二七，土地陳報亦未臻完善。今後擬按經緯座分爲若干測量孤，然後各區派員淸丈，同時並採航空測量方法，以期整理地籍工作，早日完成。至於我國之土地政策，應爲人民所共有，共治，共享，以達大同之治。</p>
<h3>張院長勸告學生　自由法治應相輔相成　求和平不該作片面宣傳</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕國府十八日公布維持社會秩序辦法，爲使其忠實有效的執行，政一張院長特發表談話如下：</p>
<p>政府改組，以結束訓政及獎備實施憲政爲主要任務，爲使此項任務順利完成，保證憲政確實實施，此時不止應完成行憲的法制準備還要完成精神的準備，盡量培養憲政精神，造成守法重紀的社會風氣，在政府方面，凡關於人民自由及其他合法權益的保陣，能提早實施者，無不盡量提早，並無不盡量澈底執行，同時也要求我全國人民提高守法精神與對國家的責任感，使自由與法治相輔相成，共同完成實施憲政的精神準備，所以未來憲政的成敗，不能單靠政府片面努力，人民同樣也負有最大責任。</p>
<h3>行憲前要守法　行憲後更如是</h3>
<p>近來各地學生的行動，實巳越出國民道德與國家法律所許可的範圍，尤以少數不良份子，對政府及長官肆意詆毀侮辱，種種越軌行爲，不但發生在政府急需安定的今天，即在憲政實施後，也決不能容許。昨天政府公布的維持社會秩序辦法，乃爲維持社會安寗秩序，避免緊急危難而採取的揹施，憲法第邪惡三條已有明文規定，在行憲後也是這樣辦，並不能認爲是今天的權宜辦法。這種辦法在政府方面必須忠實執行，在人民方面亦必須切實遵守。</p>
<p>國家經過長期抗戰，生命財產物資損失固然重大，而民德與女化的損失、尤其不可以歟計，這種超物質的損次正應從敎育方面來謀補償。本人早年曾參加敎育工作，近年對於敎育事業仍舊保持許多關係，對靑年心理與要求實有深切了解和同情。自接長政院以來，對敎育困難情形異常關切，到任之初，就約集本京專科以上各校校長·院長，敎授茶會，徵詢其所遭遇之困難，並聽取各項意見，以供施政參攷。凡有關改進敎育及改善學生生活種種實際的問題，可能設法解決的，無不力求設法解決，其難於立即解決的也無時不在縝密研討中。</p>
<h3>學生正當要求　政府決不漠視</h3>
<p>學生如有正當要求，儘可依合法合理手續，通過學校當局，向政府提出，政府決不會漠視。現各校學生竟採取直接行動，甚且在所提要求事項中，包括敎授待遇與敎育經費等學校行政問題，甚且妨得交通，脅迫政府，損毀公物，妨害公務、這種種越軌行爲，在任何先進民主國家中，無此先例。</p>
<p>再查，這次學生行動除個別問題外，所標榜反戰口號，關於以政治方法解決國內糾紛，本是政府一貫政策，自前年八月蔣主席邀中共首領商討和平大計以來，本人始終參加，政府百般忍讓，委曲求全，中共始終沒有解決誠意，最後竟公然關閉和平談判之門，然即在此種情勢下，政府仍沒有放棄初衷，只要中共願意和平，政府仍願從事以政治方法解決。這種旨趣，明白表現於新政府施政方針中，國人有目共睹，學生應知現在不去探討和平問題的癥結，反向政府借題發揮，作片面無理的要求。</p>
<h3>所謂吃光運動　置人格於何地</h3>
<p>這顯然是受了鼓動與利用，所謂「吃光運動」，置靑年人格於何地？在一般人民的心目中，又將作何感想？</p>
<p>總之，政府愛護靑年，重視敎育的初衷雖不因此次學潮而有所改變，但忠實執行命令以維護秩序安寗的職責，更不容諉卸，望各校師長善盡其勸導感化之方，作父兄的，更要多負約束管敎的責任，務使多數學生的學業與和平生活，能在理性指導之下而有所保障，不被少數所脅特。至如何克服敎育方面現有困難，本人仍願一本素來旨趣與各校敎職員先生及敎育行政當局隨時合作研討，期以多方面之協作與努力，共謀補救。最後更以至誠呼籲任校靑年，發揚理性，抑制情感，集中純潔的力量，來安定自已的學校，充實自已的知能，以建設國家從困難中尋求光明的出路。</p>
<h3>許世英今抵滬</h3>
<p>蒙藏人士馳電致賀</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕據悉：新任　藏委員會委員長許世英，十七日由港乘渣公司輪啓程轉滬來京，預計廿日抵滬，行政院長張羣特派員前往歡迎。又政院自發表許氏爲蒙藏委員會委員長後，各方以許氏德高望重，期賴彌殷。要藏班禪堪布會議廳羅　堅贊以及蒙古各盟敏珠策旺，多濟　理雅，奇俊峯等旂人士及各有關省政府，均馳電蒙委會致賀。</p>

<h3>政府決心維持秩序　隨時可宣布戒嚴　京代衛戌司令張鎮談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕自政府頒佈維持社會秩序臨時辦法後，記者特走訪首都衛戌司令部張鎭代司令官，茲誌其談話如下：</p>
<p>問，自政府頒布維持社會秩序臨時辦法後。就貴司令官觀察，目前學生遊行請願事件，是否有繼　發生可能？</p>
<p>答，有可能，但應遵照政府所頒辦法辦理，決不容有越軌或毀法亂紀之行動。</p>
<p>問，維持社會秩序臨時辦法中，規定請願不得超過十人，倘請願者超過規定人數時，則將如何？</p>
<p>答，依法決不容許。</p>
<p>問，該辦法有採取緊急措施之規定，貴司令官能見吿緊急措施之原則否？</p>
<p>答，本部對於緊急措施之進備，已有詳密之規劃，總之，本部職司維護社會治安，對於法令之執行，自屬責無旁貸，並具有最大之決心，決不容再有任何擾亂秩序之行動發生，深望輿論多加誘導，俾學生與人民團體遵循主席之愷切誥誡，得以發揮自動守法重紀之精神。</p>
<p>問，萬一有不遵此項辦法情形發生時　貴司令官是否考慮宣布戒嚴？</p>
<p>答，然，已奉有命令，隨時可以宣布。</p>
<h3>參政員交換意見　舉行會前茶話會　邵秘長稱大會力求節約</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕參政會十九日下午三時舉行會前茶話會，江庸主席，出席參政員二百餘人，首由秘長邵力子報吿：（一）此次大會原定去歲十一月十二日舉行，後以政府定是日召開國大，兩會不能同開，國大以後復因改組政府問題一再稽延、迄今始克舉行。（二）由於遞補之餘餘名及增額之七十二名，故此次較歷次大會參政員人數均多。（三）秘處籌備工作係循成規辦理，遵守節約原則，目前雖是戰後，然物價高漲較抗戰時尤有過之，故仍節約籌辦，對招待膳宿方面，如有疏忽處，盼能通知秘處。次由副秘長雷震報吿大會議事日程及開會式儀式等。其後各參政員相繼發表意見：</p>
<p>檢查過去提案　辦理情形如何</p>
<p>（一）關於參政員提案者，王亞明提出，提案不必過多，但應檢查過去提案政府辦理情形如何。吳望伋稱，應由駐會委會或秘書處負責檢查，渠認爲檢查重於提案。許德珩認爲此次提案應集中於和平問題，研究如何停止戰爭。許認爲只要停戰，則經濟政治各項問題均可解決。（二）關於政府施政報吿者、武肇煦提出，資委會應有報吿，因有關工廠者均屬資委會，水利部亦應列入報告。有人並提出，政府報吿應用面採取座談方式，因參政員非執政員也。吳望伋謂，座談應重於報吿。</p>
<p>政府答覆訽問　應請先交審查</p>
<p>（三）關於政府答覆詢問者，王亞明認爲過去政府對詢問之答覆均太疏忽，極爲隨便。黃宇人認爲政府答問應有政治家風度，負責任。另有人提出、政府之答覆應交審查會審查。（四）關於主席團問題者、處前提出主席團人員出任官吏者甚多，應予改選。張邦珍首予響應。</p>
<p>主席團多官吏　有人提議改選</p>
<p>旋此起彼落陸續發言均認爲官吏應退出主席團，主席團有改選之必要。秘長邵力子稱，根據租織條例，主席國並不限於參政員，故無庸改選，但參政員任官吏者，則應即予取消資格，惟改選主席團，秘處及參會均無權處置。（五）關於擴大參會職權者，王普涵認爲在憲政實施前，表達民意之機構，捨參會莫屬，所謂政院同立院負責，乃指向民選立院負責，目前立院尙爲官吏，是乃官對官負責則談不到民主；如謂民主，政院非向惟一民意最高機構參政會負責不可。本會如不擴大職權，開會亦無意思。朱惠淸繼起響應，認爲有擴增職權之必要。（六）達浦生提出此次會中應注意討論之議題有：（甲）早日解決中共問題，（乙）中蘇條約早日實施，及早接收旅大，（丙）美蘇邦交應平行發展，（丁）物價如脫韁之馬，應即設法爲人民之福利求其解決。許德珩亦提出農林破產，工廠關門，物價高漲，人民無以爲生等等，</p>
<p>張羣政治報告　着重中共問題</p>
<p>（七）許德珩謂，學潮處理辦法與學生舉動可能迭成流血慘案，應請注意。最後邵力子稱，廿日之政治報吿中，張院長將着重中共問認。至下午七時始散。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕中大學生一千餘人，上吳校長書，要求立即恢復上課，反對陷學校　政治漩渦，原文如下：</p>
<p>正之校長勛鑒：罷課以來，爲時一週，羣情沸騰，社會　怪，咸以中大領導遊行，素以國家民族爲立塲，而秩序之良好，尤爲社會人士所稱道。然此次罷課，乃有大不然者，不但中大聲　一落千丈，運動之純潔意義亦喪失無餘。自上星期五來，歷次系科代表大會所有決議，均趨於擴大此次運動，代表四出，赴各地聯絡，由要求公費一變而爲反對內戰，共政治意味之濃厚，亦爲歷次所僅見，似此不但深陷中大於政治漩渦，且亦使中大無法於安定中求進步。生等以爲在校讀書，應努力於眞理之探討，學識之增進，期有以貢獻於人類國家，且培成人才之學府，尤不應變爲政黨角逐之塲，擾亂社會安寗之策源地。上次辦行旣已搗毀教部玻窗，復侮辱外籍記者，道路宣傳，指責叢生，且系科代表大會通過運動中一切費用，均自同學輔盒費項下開支，試看數日來外校代表之招待，文告之紙張印刷，擴音機之租用，聯絡代表之旅膳費，及遊行中一切費用，數目之鉏，不難想見。一二五遊行費達百萬，二二二行達三百萬、若物價以十倍計，此次勢將達二三萬，則此次公費增加之數，究能受益幾何？以子之矛，攻子之盾，則此等人用心之陰險，已不以學校前途同學福利爲念，彼等旣不乘護學校，而學校又何惜於彼等？學校自復員以來，幾經挫折，始有今日之進步，且聞吾師曾在教部政院力爭經費問題，幾有成果，以罷課而止。生等痛惜學校聲名，墾請吾師沐大仁大勇之精神，立即恢復上課，致學校於安定之境，則同學幸甚，學校前途幸甚。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中大政治學系四年級代表汪叔瑜，社會學系代表何安民，經濟系四年級代表黃中，十九日發表告全校同學書，沉痛陳詞，揭發此次運動中途變質之經過，分析此次學潮之原因及有人操縱各系科代表會之實情，最後並對政府提出數項願望。該書題爲「爲自己，爲中大，爲國家，我們哭訴。」全校同學紛起響應，截至下午九時止，簽名者二千餘人。</p>
<p>〔又電〕京市公私立中等學校校長王惠三等三十餘人，爲近日各地學潮迭起，發表「致社會人士書」，與「致學生家長書」，請共同協力，納靑年於正軌，導社會於安定。</p>
<h3>平津各院校　罷課潮蔓延</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津十九日電〕津北洋南開兩大學學生自治會，十七日下午九時運夜舉行臨時會議。南開決定自十八日起，北洋決定自十九日起，分別罷課三日，響應北平，清華，北大之「反內戰反飢餓」運動。記者曾赴南開，北洋兩校巡禮，北洋校內未發現壁報標語，南開壁報間則有個人具名「反飢餓」壁報數張，似係甫經貼上者。南大陳教務長序經謂，學生如爲政治而罷課，則超出教育範國之外，如爲調整待遇而罷課，則題目並不太大，南大學生自治會會議結果，決定組織「反內戰反肌餓行動委員會」與平津及全國各校聯絡一致行動，並決定要求：（一）恢復教育經費，佔全國預算百分之十五。（二）合理提高公教人員待遇。（三）調整公費，增加公費名額。（四）副食費增爲十一萬元，並按月照物價指數調整。（五）先條班應有公費。（六）於中國內戰停止前，請美國停止對華五億貸款。（七）减輕田賦。（八）緩徽兵役。（九）免除徵發軍糧，並決定接受淸華及北大十一系級會，二十一壁報社團之建議，定六月二日爲「反內戰日」，聯絡全國一致罷課，罷教，罷工，罷市及籌組平津學生聯合會。該會迄午夜始散。北洋情形亦大致相同。</p>
<p>〔又電〕津北洋，南開決定罷課後，其他院校及中等學校，已開始遭受彼及，十八日均在準備集會，醞釀響應。北洋大學學生決於本週出校，作街頭演講。該校學生會十八日有通電一件，致參政會，內容純爲反對內戰，已無調整待遇之要求，其具體條件有三：（一）邀中共出席參政會。（二）中共未出席前，暫緩開會。（三）拋除黨派意見，共謀和平。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十九日電〕津學潮蔓延益廣，十九日續有冀工學院，國立體專，水產專科等校繼起罷課，預定二十”之游行，雖各校當局極力動阻，仍難望中止。市府十九日召集各院校負責人開會，商討適當措施，市當局表示，決本愛護靑年之至誠，對學生力予開導，使勿爲奸徒利用。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕平市專科以上學校，今繼響應反對內戰運動，罷課者有燕京，朝陽，中法，國立第一助產師院等五校，惟師院罷課之主因，在「復大運動」</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州十九日電〕國立社會教育學院一部份學生，前爲響應中大學生運動，決定自十九日起罷課，並派代表晉京請願等行動。茲該院另一部份學生，以上項行動流於過激，因別成一派，組織社教同學請求合理增加教費大會，以通電宣言爲主要呼籲工具，反對罷課行動。該校當局亦以罷課荒廢學業，現正　通學生復課。</p>
<h3>北平西單牌樓衝突事件　青年軍參長談經過實情</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十八日電〕一部學生十八日下午在西單作街頭演講時，與靑年軍二零八師士兵由口角衝突，而至互毆。記者於此不幸事件發生後，曾訪問二零八師官長，叩詢對此事件意見。據該師孫參謀長稱：「本師係訓練失業失學靑年之機構，本師士兵均係受過中等以上教育之年學生，與普通軍隊之士兵性質不同，今日適值星期，士兵休假進城，在西單與講演學生相遇，學生攔住本師士所乘汽車，書寫標語，並講演許多諷刺言語，該士兵等目覩學生在市面及本師汽車上所寫標語，多含有煽動刺激意義，耳聽學生講演，有侮辱國家元首及擾亂社會秩序之言詞，該士兵等因本身亦係青年學生，對於愛護國家，尊重元首之情緒，特別濃重，與演講學生之意見相左，因而發生口角，遂致互毆，學生與本師士兵，均有受傷者。本師士兵二人，在景山後街與多數學生相遇，被包圍毆打，受傷甚重，現送醫院診治中。對此不幸事件，深表遺憾，除飭查明肇事士兵予以懲辦外，尚望有關學校當局，對於學生亦懇切開導，以國家爲嚴，社會秩序及學生學業爲重，勿多作有刺激性之言論及標語，以免事態擴大，影響社會秩序。孫參謀長最後對記者　析靑年軍土兵與學生口角衝突之原因稱：本師士兵，旣係學生中受過相當訓練，對於時局之認識亦較深刻，前者本師士兵在魏市善莊演習時，曾遭遇共軍之襲擊，死傷甚多，並在該地看到許多標語，與今日在街頭所見者大致相同。又本市士兵在頤和園，曾遭遇學生之辱駡，謂本師土兵爲國民黨牲牲品，今日在西單亦有學生以同樣言詞侮辱該士兵，如「靑年軍係國民黨走狗！」「你們應放下槍桿」等語。該士兵等因刺激，遂向學生理論，因而發生口角，終至互相毆打。至於此項不幸事件之性質，應認爲係學生間因意見不同而偶發之事件，不能視爲學生與軍隊之衝突，希望能早日獲得合理之解決。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕北大等校學生組成之後援會，今日下午二時招待記者，說明經過，謂昨日學生與軍隊衝突事，已對行轅提出抗議。又謂受傷住院者共八人，重傷之三人，已無生命危險。同學捐款慰問，渠等不受，轉獻後援會。昨傳學生失踪說，至今尚未證實。</p>
<p>〔又電〕北大，淸華，燕京，中法，朝陽，北洋，平部師院，鐵院及天津南開，北洋，唐山，師院等十一校所組成之後援會，決定明日三地同時遊仃。</p>

<h3>暹對我過境僑胞　苛收巨額入口稅</h3>
<p>七十餘人無力繳納被扣</p>
<p>〔本報福州十九日電〕戰後緬歸僑復員返緬者，間多取道暹羅，該地政府對華僑過境，頗多苛擾，頃據曼谷來電稱：暹政府近突增華僑入口稅至每人一千五百銖，約值國幣二千餘萬元，我僑胞無力繳納而被扣者已有七十餘人，盼我僑胞返緬勿再取道暹羅</p>
<h3>胡適對學潮談話　盼學生勿以罷課作手段</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕胡適一反過去沉默能度，今日就蔣主席對學生文告及國務會議所決定之臨時措施暨學生罷課一事，有所表示。渠稱：蔣主席文告及臨時措施之公佈，其時間在十八日上午八時，當非針對北大事件而發。胡氏指出學生鬧學潮是動了感情，同時對政府文告上說學生的行動是直接間接受了共黨的策動，亦曾加以說明。渠表示：學生是靑年人，在這種困難環境下，確是感到了苦悶。又謂：緊急措施是臨時維特秩序的辦法，針對請願而發。昨在行轅李宗仁與各校院談話會上，我曾重述二十年來我當說的話，即靑年對政治感興趣是自然的現象，亦係古今中外的通則。而倡革新政治的責任，往往都落在靑年身上。談及學生罷課，胡氏指出並非辦法，研究政治，發表言論，甚至到校外去作政治活動，不論地上地下，原無不可，但目前政治問題太複雜，而政協後十個多月都未收到效果，何况學生罷課。我對靑年要求改進現狀有伺情，但希望勿犧牲學業，千預政治。工人罷工之能收得效果的，也只限於爭薪金或工作時間的數字，而以之干政，便難有效果。改革政治社會制度，不用革命手段，就須經過合法的民意機構，以促其實現，深盼學生勿以罷課來作手段。</p>

<h3>參政會又開幕了！　——參玫員如何善盡其職員？</h3>
<p>國民參政會第四屆第三次大會，今晨九時在南京開幕。在全國擾攘不安的今日，我們對於這次國民參政會的召開，不能不抱着若干期望。</p>
<p>國民參政會原產生於抗戰時間，首已由參政會係於民國廿七年七月間在武漢成立的。當時雖因戰事緊急，未及採用民選辦法，但其參政員的遴選，包括各省，市，邊疆，僑民，以及一切民間團體，凡是各黨各派的領袖與全國社會賢達，幾大體羅致在內；所以在參政會的本身，就象徽着全國的團結。它在八年抗戰期，代表人民，督責政府執行抗戰國策，對於爭取抗戰勝利，確有無上的貢獻。現在抗戰勝利了，國民大會也已開過了，新憲法不久實施，國家步入眞正的憲政時期，爲時不遠，參政會存在的意義，固然要大爲减少，但在國內局勢發展到目前地步，和談之門早已被中共關閉，政治僵局迄今並無打開的希望，而行憲的國民大會猶有待於選舉，在此過渡之際，實在還迫切需要一個象徵着全國團結一致的機構，來建立民主統一之堅强的基礎，以打開目前政治上的似局。所以這次參政會的召開，意義應不平當。我們的確應該注意參政員們如何善盡其任務。</p>
<p>第一，目前全國上下幾無不渴望和平安定，參政員中也有若干人意欲提案，表示他們希望重開和談。我國經過這八年的艱苦大戰，早巳創鉅痛深，抗戰勝利之後，政府早想與民休息，人民欲恢複元氣，故和平原爲人人所切望。今日之事，不是和平與否的問題，而是應該辨別誰要破壞和平，以及如何遏止這破壞和平的惡勢力的蔓延問題。我們痛定思痛，覺得挽救目前危機的唯一辦法，仍在用人民的力量，喚醒中國共產黨的澈底覺悟，能以國家人民爲重，立卽放下武器，替全國的老百姓留下一綫生機。周炳琳，錢端升，許德珩三參政員雖曾建議政府，邀請中共參政員出席，但中共參政員仍未接納他們這番好意，仍與政府爲敵，拒不出席參政會，我們老百姓不能不表示不失望。老實說，今日國內和戰的關鍵，完全握在中共的手裏：和談的能否恢復，完全繫於中共的一念。參政會果欲討論到這個恢復和談的問題，我們希望來自各地民間的參政員諸君，均能正視現實，先要有跑到中共割據的區域裏去「與虎謀皮」的勇氣。大家須知國民政府早在去年國民大會開會以前，明令停戰，無如中共置之不理，而且指爲片面停戰，不生效力，是則瞪明要打仗到底者乃中共而非政府。參政員以及其他亂喊「反內戰」的人們，倘不跑到中共區域去拼命制止打仗，只是在京滬一帶高談闊論，徒然教天眞的老百姓空歡喜，而識者反將謂爲替中共劃緩兵之策。</p>
<p>第二，全國大多數人民心頭最感煩悶的，莫過於經濟財政的危機，目前還未脫離險境，人民困苦，幾乎無以爲生。最近一月來，社會的紛擾不安，人心的浮動不定，其間固有若隱若現的某種策動力量在作祟，但政府處理尚未能當機立斷，使財政經濟趨於穩定，要亦不可諱言。參政會在此時召開，不論爲了國家民族的命運，或是爲了民生的困苦，參政員諸君必須平心靜氣，實事求是，共同商量出一個切實具體的辦法來，好教在水深火熱之中的老百姓，庶幾能喘過一口氣來。我們不希望參政員只是捕風捉影，東責西駡，聊以快意；我們却誠懇的期望他們針對民間疾苦以及政府困難的現狀，在夾縫中精細打算，爲政府惜箸以籌，尋出一條挽救經濟危機比較可行的切實辦法。</p>
<p>要之，我們對於今天開幕的參政會，雖不敢抱着無窮的奢望，但至少切盼參政員諸君要有大智大勇。站在人民立塲，想出一種解救經濟危機的積極方法來，督責政府執行，這是大智。抱定「我不入地獄，誰入地獄」的決心，結合了多數參政員，大家跑到中共割據的區域裏去，用人民的呼聲，促使他們放下武器，從而拔除破壤和平的禍根，這是大勇。參政員諸君果有此種大智大勇和精神，則此參政會大會之召開，方可期其有所收穫。否則，我們未免爲國家的公努大量消耗得可惜！</p>
<h3>法令與威信</h3>
<p>維持社會秩序臨時辦法六條，前日經國務會議決議通過而後，當卽由國府發布命令，並且將刑法等有關法律條文，更爲擇要公告，昨天全國名地報紙，均有揭載。這條命令，這些法條，原是政府爲公安不受危害，爲秩序不遭破壞計，不得不採取的一種措置。凡是善良而守法的公民，一定會尊重這些法令。亦惟有嚴格執行這些法令，政府纔能盡其（除暴安良的職責。</p>
<p>可是法令之所以可貴，人在乎「執行」之有效力。孟子說得好：「徒法不能以自行」。故有了法令，必須有嚴正無私的執行法令的人，「司法」之所以應被重視渚在此，一司法」之所以應保持其尊嚴者亦在此。惟有重視司法，使司法機關眞能有其獨立超然之尊嚴地位，而後政府纔可以有威信。政府有威信，國家方可期其由亂而治。</p>
<p>因此，我們回想近來有許多社會動盪的事象，所以醱成的原因，其間固或含有若干陰謀的作用在內，而政府應付失策，自隳威信，亦爲不可補償的損失。有些事，本來可以不必在此時趕辦，却先率爾決定，並且堅執要辦；可是等到反對了，抗議了，罷課了，聚衆請願了，則又一變而爲無不可以接納。甚至明明違法犯紀之事，理應依法制裁，却又往往受脅於羣衆，不惜爲法外的遷就，以圖息事甯人。其用意固或未可厚非，殊不知事雖息，而人却未寗。因爲此類息事之道，不求之於法，而覓之於法外，則何能制止將來的違法舉動？譬諸昨天，明明有煌煌命令，不准學生罷課遊行了，而數千學生仍有罷課遊行之舉，軍警勸阻無效，依然放任遊行了事。這種執行法令的方法，豈非形同對於法令的諷刺！法令公布的第一天，當局就在事實上對於法令的效力來這樣一個反證，我們不禁深深地爲政府的威信致慨！</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京十九日電〕社會黨片山委員長今日個別訪問自由黨吉田及民主黨　田兩總裁，暨國民協同黨三木書記長，商談首相問題。吉田虞田兩人均代表各該黨表明贊成片山出任首相之態度，同時吉田對本人是否入閣，聲明保留態度。蘆田亦稱：本人態度須俟吉田決定後，再爲考慮。因此明日仍須再度舉行四黨代表會談，商討決定。據傳：吉田保留入閣態度之理由，乃社會黨左派與共產黨之關係尚未明確斷絕。。社會黨方面本擬請吉田出任片山內閣之內務大臣或國務大臣。國民協同黨三木書記長在片山訪問時聲明全面支支社會黨首相內閣之態度。在今日片山作各黨個別訪問以後，在明日開會之第一次國會中，社會黨片山委員長出任首相問題，已有絕對把握。</p>

<h3>蘇聯代表團一行　今明可抵達漢城　美代表團顧問訪霍奇</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城十九日電〕出席美蘇聯合委員會之蘇方代表，現仍逗留莫斯科，因氣候不良，尚未飛抵平壤。據悉須於一二日後始可由蘇飛平壞再轉來漢城云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城八日電〕蘇聯代表團七十五人今日米能如期抵此，同時，朝鮮人民已將原定反對託管遊行示威運動打消。蘇聯代表團愆期原因不詳，十九日可望自韓北佔領區乘火車前米，俾於二十日與美方代表恢復談判。朝鮮政治領袖均稱，此次打消示威運動係遵警局勸告。美方人士並稱，參加示威者將影響其與美蘇代表磋商資格。</p>

<h3>美蘇委會展期開會</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京十九日電〕漢城來電稱：美蘇混合委員會之會議，將展期數日舉行。此間美方人士對此一報告，並不表示悲觀，亦不擬發表意見。</p>
<h3>中東地中海防務　英準備移交美國　帝國軍事基地撤至東非</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕英方消息靈通人士今日聲稱：英國已準備將地中海與中方面軍事責任，移交美國，而將英帝國防務撤至東非洲。據英方接近陸軍部之軍界有資格人士稱，此舉意謂地中海與蘇彝士運河之防務，將由美國負責，但英國並不因此放棄其在中東之經濟與政治利益。英外長貝文上週五已在下院聲明，英國擬繼續關懷中東與地中海，英方軍事與供應基地撤往東非，預定二三年內完成，使英帝國五十年來之防務計劃爲之一變。美國在地中海方面已有確切利益，且實力充沛，故能接堂此重大責任，至於英國決定加强東非洲根雅與羅特西亞等區防務，乃因英國已定明年六月以前退出印度，巴勒斯坦局勢不穩，以及蘇丹　來地位未定之故。英官方承認非洲防務策略草案，必須獲得當地居民之積極合作，更須與法比兩國互相策應，此兩國乃英國在非洲最重要而可靠之鄰邦。英法比三國殖民地行政官員明日將在巴黎會議，廣泛討論非洲交通，公共衛生，糧食供應等問題。三國並將設立聯合委會，以執行巴黎會商之決議。</p>

<h3>日否認建軍要求</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京十九日電〕日本外務省今日否認若干通訊社所傳，日本擬於佔領狀態結束後建軍十萬名之說。其先據某一高級外交官員告本社稱，某一日本官員曾向其探詢渠所代表之政府對於日本建軍要求之反響，此項陸軍及少數空軍，僅擬作防止走私等之用。</p>
<h3>東言匯理銀行　東京分行開業</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十九日電〕越南東方匯理銀行東京分行，已於今日開幕，此爲外國銀行獲准在東京開業之第二家。第一家即花旗銀行，已於去年夏季在此間復業。匯理行今根據現行條例，僅能辦理佔領軍私人之存放業務，仍不得辦理商業與匯劃業務，尚待日本與外國恢復貿易關係後，始可恢復外（國銀行之業務。聞英法兩國銀行在日本所設之分行，在短期內亦將復業。</p>
<h3>英批准計劃　建原子能發電廠</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕「每日快報」今日載稱：英國第一所原子發電廠，將建造於坎伯蘭郡之特列格城，該廠規模宏大，擬用鈾產電力，內裝藉鈾發動之引擎數具，原子能委會擬定第一具引擎在五年內發動之計劃，已經內閣核准。估計建造該廠，需費七百萬鎊（合二千八百萬美元），其主要引擎最大產電量爲七萬五千瓩足供與利物浦相等城市所需電燈與電力·該城人口八十五萬五千人，乃英國第四犬城市，視該引擎成績如何，然後決定在該地添置其他引華。第二所原子發電廠，將設於蘇格　某地。兩廠產電總量，最後應達一百萬瓩以上，供應英國所需電力四分之一，每年可省煤五百萬噸云。按每日快報係皮佛勃洛克主辦，傾向保守黨，日銷三百四十五萬份，爲全球之冠。</p>
<h3>美陸次羅雅爾　暢論世界局勢</h3>
<p>謂美蘇必須解決其爭端</p>
<p>〔合衆社喬治亞州阿特朗達城十八日電〕陸軍部次長羅雅爾頃在此間談稱：世界二一大政治與軍事國家，即美國與蘇聯，必須設法解決其爭端，不應互相綏靖。目前國際形勢，義大利與日本皆已成戰敗國家，德國亦已予征服，中國則正在向統一之塗邁進，發展其龐大潛力，惟進展遲緩而時告中斷。印度雖離其發揮其實力之期仍遠。歐洲。中東·遠東·南美·非洲等小國，就軍事觀點而論，則仍不足重視。吾國與英國之關係雖屬密切，但英國在二次世界大戰之後，已喪失其軍事實力，且已不再是主宰海洋之國家，其帝國系統亦巳鬆弛，不若數百年前之强盛，故現僅美國國蘇聯爲世界二大軍事與政治國家，且在數十年內亦不致改變此種局面，故軍備與外交今皆繫於美蘇二國之間云。</p>
<h3>彭頓力主保持　美對外廣播</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美助理國務卿彭頓宣稱：如國會切斷國務院對歐廣播美國呼聲之「喉管」，則此事將爲一國家之大患。據其告無綫電聽衆稱：最低限度，渠將奮鬥達到使渠在此一方面之新聞及文化計劃，能够挽回，以使世界明白美國民主政治之眞相，以便對抗蘇聯所進行之虛僞宣傳。國會方面之批評家，不顧彭頓，國務卿馬歇爾及退休之副國務卿艾克遜之一再呼籲，決定將此計劃全部取消，其中並包括向外國廣播之美國「純粹不僞的眞相」之短波無綫電廣播在內。彭頓拒絕顧問委員會所提出之建議，即將廣播移交私人企業經營，渠仍堅持，廣播必須在國務院主辦之下云。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾與克萊頓　將會商經濟政策　首要問題爲實施杜魯門主義</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華感頓十八日電〕國務卿馬歇爾定十九日與負責經濟事務之副國務卿克萊頓開始總檢討美國國際經濟政策。議程中首要問題將爲實施杜魯門政策之步驟，即如何以經濟援助給予願意與共產勢力抗衡之國家。克萊頓現在日內瓦出席十八國家所組織之國際貿易組織籌備會議，預料在十八日晚可飛返華府。在艾克遜六月中辭職後，克萊頓將爲國務院中碩果僅存之老官員。在未來之經濟危機歲月中，克萊頓將爲馬歇爾所倚重之左右手。馬克兩人會議之由來，乃因美國最高官員咸認爲本年底之前有發生世界經濟危機之可能。據估計，爲實行杜魯門之政策，最近數年內美國每年約需以五十億元用借款等方式貸於需要各國，特別爲西歐各國。美議會領袖預示，議會—尤其爲本屆議會，不可能通過任何世界性之經濟救濟計劃。雖然每年五十億之金額已有多方提及，然政府官員並無人加以公開估計者，此金額中大部份或將出諸和平時之租借方式。若干美國西部各洲之民主黨員會謂：美國如能在第一次大戰後化費十億元爭取和平，則第二次大戰即可避免矣。</p>
<h3>英蘇修約談判　已在蘇京進行</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕關於修正一九四二年英蘇兩國同盟條約一事，頃據此間政界人士談稱：英國駐蘇大使裴特遜爵士刻正就此事與蘇聯政府進行談判。按在四國外長在莫斯科開始會議時，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曾向英國政府提出一項新草案，禁止簽字國之一與任何爲另一簽字國所認爲態度不友好之國家締結友好條約，英國政府當時並未接受此項草案，直至數日前，始將其對案提交蘇聯政府。蘇聯當局目下似已將其意見口頭通知裴特遜大使，莫洛托夫外長不久亦將通知貝文外相，英國之對案，是否接受作爲，今後談判之基礎</p>
<h3>范登保竭力反對　委任新政派人員</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九電日〕美參院外交委員會定二十日開始聽取任命別達爾爲美國駐聯合國經濟社會理事會代表事，而今日各共和黨領袖已在準備斷然反對委任羅斯福新政人員爲政府高級官員之運動。領導此運動者爲委員會主席范登堡，彼爲共和黨最有勢力之外交政策發言人，最近曾要求杜魯門撤消對別達　之任命。范登堡對杜魯門其他外交官之任命均表同意，然渠認爲必須阻止別達爾之任命，且此運動之時　亦巳成熟。渠稱別氏不能執行杜魯門之兩黨外交政策，蓋彼爲極端之新政主義者云。</p>
<h3>杜魯門老母病危</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十九日廣播：杜魯門頃電告其母病狀巳有進步。</p>
<p>〔聯合社米蘇里州格蘭特浮十九日電〕杜魯門　統太夫人，高齡九十有四，息病垂危，昨晨蘇見起色，午後又復轉惡，心臟疲　，狀殊可慮，總統常侍在側，未作返　　府之計，各項重要公文及報告，均由飛機送請批閱。</p>
<h3>德境英美佔區訂立　經濟行政協定　內容包含三要點</h3>
<p>〔路透社漢堡十八日電〕德國通訊社今日發表官方文告稱，德境英軍區長官羅勃森與美軍區長官克萊所成立之兩區經濟行政協定，包括三要點：（一）英美資金之撥付及共同使用協定，以復興德國工業，推進德國之進出口計劃。（二）嚴格規定五個兩區行政機構之行政及立法權限。（三）成立建立經濟委員會之原則上的協議。該經濟委員會之職權，尚在考慮中，其委員由德國各邦依其居民人數比例推選，成立以後，將在若千限制以內，具有立法機構之職權。此外，更擬設立中央行政已由，由每邦推舉代表一人組成，得依經濟委員會之決議，向兩區當局頒發指令，並獲取其報告。</p>
<h3>法佔區公民投票　基督社會佔先</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社德國巴頓十九日電〕德境法軍佔領區三處轄區，昨日舉行立法選舉及公民投票，所得結果已通過轄區臨時政府所擬就之憲法，基督社會黨獲得空前之勝利，惟所得多數票相差甚微，尤其是萊茵與巴拉丁那特區所得多數僅爲百分之五二。八。巴拉古那特區之投票人且多反對憲法草案，後得萊茵區之擁護，始獲挽回。基督社會黨在選舉中共得九八四·五三一票，第二爲社會民主黨，得五七二·六六七票，第三爲自由黨，得二四〇·二六二票，第四爲共黨，得一五九·六九〇票。萊茵·巴拉丁那特區投票人數最多，佔選民百分之七十一，其次爲巴頓與胡登堡區，情形較上次選舉遜色。左派政漱競選成績如次：共黨略遜，社會民主黨有具體勝利。自由黨較上次選舉所得票數幾增加一倍，基督社會黨雖獨佔鰲頭，但亦稍受挫折。此間人士認爲社會民主黨之勝利，殆由於該黨領袖施瑪契主張德國統一之政策所獲得</p>
<h3>美主張從速討論　國際警衛軍問題</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十八日電〕美國代表團今日稱，美國將催促安全理事會立即討論國際警衛軍編制事宜，此事最近曾因聯合國機構討論巴勒斯坦與希臘問題而擱漢。軍事參謀會議關於組織國際軍之初次報告，顯示蘇聯對於根本原則，尚未贊同。此項報告書自五月一日以來即擱置於安理會桌上。美國代表團曾要求將其列入安理會五月間初期會議議程，但因蘇聯堅持首先討論希臘問題而罷，巴勒斯坦問題之討論遂再度使之稽延。</p>

<h3>埃總理答覆貝文言論　英軍應退妯埃及　蘇丹與埃實有統一必要</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅十八日電〕挨及總理諾克拉西爲答覆英外相貝文在下院外交辯論中關於埃及之聲明，特於今日發表聲明，要求英軍立即自埃及撤退，並表示埃及不能接受一九三六年英埃條約之繼續。其言有謂，英軍之繼續駐埃，侵犯自由獨立國家之主權。英政府深知英軍之駐埃，違反埃及人民之志願，，吾人一致要求此等軍隊立即完全撤退，不能以修改舊約或訂立新約爲條件。英方曾謂埃及若能同意英方所願意之條約，英軍即準備撤退，又曰除非簽訂新約，一九三六年之英埃條約當繼續有效，換言之，即英軍當繼續駐埃。查一九三六之條約，係在特殊環境下訂立，此項條件今已不復存在，當時所有之戰爭危險，今早已結束，故一九三六年之條約已達到其目的。此約違反聯合國憲章，吾人決不允其織續，余相信無一聯合國會員國得同意强迫吾人接受外國軍隊之駐防。英國且復鼓動蘇丹脫離埃及，蘇丹與埃及之統一，爲尼羅河流域全體人民之志願，蘇丹人民之自由決不因此項統一而受損，爲確保蘇丹之安全，並發展蘇丹人之利益起見，統一實爲必要。英軍之駐在蘇丹，係佔領埃及之結果，故英軍今亦不復有權駐在蘇丹。吾人今當向聯合國機構申訴與英國之爭執，聯合國各會員國生權平等之原則，必能保障吾國之權利。貝文在下院發表之聲明，曾謂埃及對於英帝國具有極重要性，故英帝國之恢復和平時代軍事立塲，與此一中心有密切連繫，如若封閉此一中心而不開放其他途徑，殊屬不公允，貝文並曰，埃前總理薛特基業已承認此點，然英國撤退之條件，今竟爲埃方拒絕，英國仍以一九三六年之條約爲據云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播：埃及首相日前發表聲明，謂不論英埃是否重訂新約或修政一九三六年條約，英軍必須立則退出埃及，英外部頃就此事加以答覆，據稱，英方雖同意於一九四九年前撤退駐埃英軍，但仍堅持埃及須立即與英方談判一九三六年條約之重訂，並謂該約決不因埃及之單方面聲明完成任務而告終止。</p>

<h3>美「防疫雜誌」發表　細菌戰爭報告書　此種戰爭無法實行國際管制</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕「防疫」雜誌獲得陸軍部許可，今日發表美國科學家協會三會員對細菌戰爭之報告書，說明卅三稱人類及動植物疾病，適用於細菌戰爭，另有三十七種似不適用。該報告書一如史密斯關於原子戰爭之報告，臚列各種可能性，但保留軍事秘密。據稱，細菌戰爭似不必用於攻學廣大區域，儘可攻擊特別目標，摧毀陸海軍基地，城市及工廠之類。報告書並詳論各種可能的攻擊與防禦，以便一般人明瞭細菌戰爭之眞相。據稱細菌戰爭暫時無法如原子炸彈之實行國際管制。甚至蕞爾小國及無名醫藥實騐室，均可成爲細菌武器之策源地。事實上，即使在二次世界大戰之前，世界任何細菌學家祗須有時問作防疫研究，即可發現應用細菌之方法。飛機殆爲傳播細菌最佳之工具，空中散放細菌由呼吸而傳入人體，實爲最大之威脅。水與食物之細菌亦被述及，但並不認爲可以成功。最得用之戰爭細菌爲「吐拉勒米亞病菌」或稱「兎子熟」，此種細菌散佈空中，可以引起肺炎，呼吸器型黑死病及類似鼻疽之疾病。至於用鼠，虱散佈之黑死病菌，並不適用於戰爭，因祗須消滅老鼠，病根即絕。</p>

<h3>影佐未押來　引渡兩戰犯　僅田中解到　台變逃犯黃在榮同來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日重要戰犯前與著名女問諜川島芳子同在華北方面主持特務工作之田中軍吉中將，及台變逃日要犯黃在榮兩人，已於昨日自東京押乘建國號機，於下午六時飛抵本市。田中即行解送江灣戰犯管理處收押，黃在榮則響押於淞滬警備司令部以待轉解台灣。至於另一重要日本戰犯一手支特們政權曾任偽國民政府顧問之影佐禎昭少將，此次並未押來。</p>

<h3>啤酒當令　工人怠工　怡和廠大損失</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕時已入夏，啤酒正屆暢銷之時，本市楊樹浦英商怡和啤酒廠一百八十餘名工人，爲要求改善待遇不遂，突於十八日起實行怠工。廠方損失甚大，現正由社會局調解中。</p>
<p>此次怠工之主因，據工會方面稱，起因於指數尚未解凍時，資方暗中增加職員底薪六元至七十元不等。工人因念增加底薪，有違政府法令，故要求廠方念工作勞績，發給生產補助金。廠方對該項要求之答覆爲（一）如生活不够維持，可予額外工作，以增加收入。（二）准予預支成人每名二十萬元，童工十五萬元，但至月底發薪時，須一次扣淸。工人認爲該項答覆於實際無補，遂堅持要求補發二三四三月指數凍結時之生活生產補助金。自五月起則每月按解凍指數發給工資，且以本年度一月份米價爲比例補助，以後每月補給，直至米價與指數平準爲止。否則職負加底薪，工人亦須同樣增加。此外並要求廠方舉辦工人福利設施。</p>

<h3>吳淞海塘　坍毀待修　田畝久荒亟盼酏糧　議長訪吳淞江灣　區民提數項請求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會潘議長，昨日下午赴吳淞，江灣二區訪問，並有各該區區長，區民代表大會主席及參議員等迎候陪同視察。所到各處有吳淞中學，砲台灣工國公學原址（現爲一〇一後方傷兵醫　），吳淞海塘，二區區公所，二區市街及鄉僻之地。</p>
<p>議長視察結果，及各區區長希望建設或改善者，主要有以下數點；（一）江灣吳淞二區區民最近聞政府當局配售食米以棚戶爲對象，而不及該二區，咸起極大恐慌。蓋政府當局以爲郊區農民自耕自食，毋須再予配售，然事實則不然，因該區在戰時爲軍事之區，農地悉被日軍圈用，年久不墾，現已無法種稻，致食糧大感缺乏，米店已數日無米出售。故望政府當局能明瞭此點，而對配售辦法加以考慮。（二）吳淞海塘石堤已逐漸坍塌，望工務當局趕修。</p>
<p>渡輪鐵路　盼能恢復</p>
<p>（三）市輪渡在戰前吳淞曾設有碼頭，且每日有十二班之多，現則碼頭僅剩底椿，而輪渡每日祗一班，停泊江心，致來往乘客或販賣貨物等極感不便。望予恢復並增加班次。（四）淞滬鐵路在戰時被敵人拆去鐵軌一部份，致目前僅能自滬駛抵高境廟，對於淞滬交通亦受重大影響。且談綫爲我國最早之一鐵道，具有歷史價値，亦希望能予恢復。（五）吳淞江灣前被日人圈去民地，自政府接收後，旣不發還，又未價購，但田賦則仍由農民繳納，殊不公平，盼政府當局能速決定辦法。應還者還，非徵收者則價購，免再繳田賦。（六）江灣走馬塘疏濬經費不够，致未能完工，除盼當局增撥材料費用外，並應籌一全盤計劃，即該塘出口必經之沙涇港亦當疏濬，俾可通入浦江，否則走馬塘即能疏濬完畢，亦屬徒然。</p>

<p>未設中學　長學困難</p>
<p>（七）江灣區乃係戰前江灣及殷行合併而成，範圍廣大，但僅設有小學，致小學畢業兒童升學困難，望敎育當局能添辦一中學。（八）吳淞逸仙公路應有公共汽車行駛，如公用局無經費舉辦，則望能准許吳淞江灣區人民共同組織公共汽車公司辦理。若有贏餘，則取之以作公益事業經費。（九）江灣救火會現僅有救火車一輛，設備又簡陋，望市府當局能再予充實器材。他如衛生淸道方面亦望改善。該二區內淸道夫每區僅三數人，則其淸道結果可想而知。</p>

<h3>病人口鼻噴血　慘呼一聲而亡　中山醫院施用手術　家屬認爲死因可疑　屍體昨經解剖相驗</h3>
<p>貴陽航空學校學生顧康龍，年十八歲，浦東南匯人，上月間來滬，暫寓西門路九三弄四號伊叔顧祥　家，不料顧突患鼻出血病症·乃由伊叔代爲延醫診治無效，於四月十四日，送往楓林橋中山醫院住院求治，仍無效果，直至本月十六日，該院徵得顧之家屬同意，施用手術，開刀診治，終因出血過多，延至當日下午身死。家屬當以該醫院有過失殺人之嫌，遂向常熟警分局報告前情，另派警員，將該院醫師李兆亭傳案，一面將屍體車送同仁輔元堂驗屍所。昨晨由檢察官方正偕同法醫沈大鈞蒞塲，先由屍叔顧祥麟投訴前情，並稱本案分爲三點：（一）病人是否有開刀</p>
<p>取出脾臟</p>
<p>之必要，醫師應當注意，（二）開刀後將病人放在四號病房，並無醫師照顧，以致病人口鼻噴出大量鮮血，慘呼一聲而亡，（三）痛人於一點廿分死亡，院方於二點卅分方始通知家屬，迨家屬到塲，院方尚稱再將屍體解剖，藉資研究致死之原因。以上種種，足以證明該死醫院師有</p>
<p>過失殺人</p>
<p>之嫌，請求依法訊辦。訊之醫師李兆亭稱，廿六歲，鄞縣人，中山醫院助理醫師，該病人是我負責診治，十六日上午九時許，經院方徵得病人之家屬同意簽字後，由主任醫師李家忠主治開刀，由民人與計蘇華·邱傳祿·黃添汝·朱民强等諸醫師爲助理，動手術後，將病人送往四號房間，經我陪伴看護，終因病勢嚴重，延至下午一時身死。惟該病人生前流血過多，</p>
<p>曾經輪血</p>

<h3>京滬各院校學生　定今日自動復課　中大等五校發有護校宣言</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕國立中大等五校之罷課潮，至昨晚已轉　點。大部份學生，以學潮業已變質，且罷課妨碍學業，故發動簽名，展開「護校復課運動」，組織復課運動委員會，響應者極爲踴躍。該會幷發表宣言，略謂「我們深感大的民言精神，已受到　大的威脅，中大的自由堡壘已突換了不自由的苦海，進而準備把我們四千六百多同學的純正的呼聲，變爲政治鬥爭的吶喊。我們相信不祗我們這一羣，還有更多的同學，都會感到這種請願的方式，是一種浪費。這種專制的行爲，沾汚了榮譽學府，我們出於愛　國家，愛國全中華民族的自由意志，我們要大聲疾呼，我們尤將抱頭痛哭：（一）政府拿出魄力來，拯救苦難中的敎育。（二）我們要吃飯，我們要讀書。（三）各黨派拿出良心來，　了我們吧。（四）我們堅決反對，以罷遊行的方式請願。（五）我們尤其反對請願的目的，中途變質。（六）我們主張立即復課」。</p>
<p>金大明日復課</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕金陵大學全體教員，爲勸告學生，早日復課，並停止參加遊行，特於十九日下午，召開緊急會議，當經議決，二十日起全體復課，並通過告全體同學書，規定二十日晨第一堂課起，不分有課無課之敎員，一律於上午人時到校，各敎員且願整日留校，以便督促。又該校學生，已有復課會之組織。是以該校部份學生罷課問題，即可告一段落。</p>

<p>復旦今日復課</p>
<p>〔中央社訊〕復旦大學多數學生，反對「吃光」「光吃」運動，昨日發動要求復課簽名運動。該項遝動，係由學生江英生，吳加祥等數十人署名，發表宣言，以罷課是全體同學的損失，要求即日復課。是項宣言發表後，各同學紛紛響應簽名，迄昨晚止，簽名人數已達一四八七人。此一部份學生，並於昨日下午二時，邀請該校章益校長，向全體同學演講。按該校原定於昨日上午復課，因敎授接獲通知太遲，多未能趕到，僅有士木系一班，照常上課。下午則以校長演講，公布停課，但該校公布，定於今日一律復諜。</p>
<p>章益剴切講演</p>
<p>二時十五分，章校長於該校大禮堂演講，到學生八百餘人。其講詞大致略謂：此次本校學潮，係於上星期五下午校外學生要求參加而起，至於罷課，爲系科代表聯合會決定。該系科代表聯合會之組織，幷不合法，自屬無效。再此次要求增加經費，改善員生待遇，動機極爲合理，但須循正當途徑，向當局提出要求。至於反對內戰，不惟學生如此，亦爲全國人民所期望，但內戰屬於雙方，應向雙方請願。關於「吃光」運動名稱，似有未當，蓋目前謂營養不足則有之，若謂饑餓，則有事實存在。且刻又高呼所謂「搶救敎育運動」，本人極爲痛心，欲知搶救敎育，首須安定，罷課造成不安定現象，豈能搶救，眞理並非用宣傳方式，高喊口號，即可獲得者。再學校學生要求上課，乃基本要求，亦爲學校責職所在，決不容許同學，甩一種力量，迫使其他學生，不能上課，最後幷宣布決定明日（即今日）上午八時，一律上課，直至二時四十五分，始於掌聲中講畢。又該校學生江英生吳加祥一千四百八十七人，昨向復旦當局要求：（一）立刻公示解散所謂系科代表大會，幷追求其負責人非法領導罷課之責任，（二）勒令本校搶救敎育運動大會，立即停止活動，（三）請學校即刻去電敎育部，否認本校請願代表，（四）提議學校校務會議通過成立自治會之監督機構。</p>
<p>大同準備復課</p>
<p>〔中央社訊〕大同大學大部部份學生，自組織校政革新委員會後，已與校方作數次非正式之談判，幷提出革新方案，聞校方對該項要求，認爲復課後，定能順序參照改進，決不敷衍，欽大部份同學，均表同意，預料大同大學，將於日內復課云。</p>

<h3>證交作昨已恢復交易　華股跌風一面倒　各方均在靜候新部令</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交昨在人心恍惚中開市，多空雙方，展開空前肉搏，致各股行市，兔起　落，廣帮北帮以及紗廠帮買買甚健，低後會起反動，但取銷遞交，紗廠罷工，國行巨額差進，加上港申電迭長，終告迫低，除榮豐麗安外，一致跌停。綠紀人公會所提竟見，在部令未到達前，揣測紛紜，遂予投機者以製造謠　之機會。據悉昨日後市收繼跌停後，塲外交易絕跡。而昨日證交當局，對市塲門禁，特別森　。每家經紀人至多限三人憑證人入塲。據證交發言人稱：此舉旨在杜絕非業中人，混入市塲搗亂行市。依昨日情勢觀察，證交當局，財經兩部監理官，經紀人方面，均無任何新舉措，蓋正靜候新部頒到云。</p>
<p>晨初</p>
<p>開出現交成交不多，統益微挫，　安漲停，景綸跌停，榮豐平平，迨遞永紗以跌停板開盤，人心恐慌。統益新光新華景福景綸火柴美亞中絲新亞信和勤興紛紛跌停，遞永紗在跌停限度，成交甚多，塲外且有報高。延至十時後，榮鹽首先漲停，一四號一六二號八五號一二一號六五號二八號一〇五號八九號一〇六號一五三號俱進，升爲六四〇〇元。一四二號一八五號一四三號三〇號二三一號一五二號逢高了結復告跌停，一六二號一七二號一七三號九四號一二九號一五五號趁低進至六二〇〇元外，永公亦告跌停。一八五號八五號二二三號二二四號六五號脫手，再將遞永紗迫低至六〇五〇元左右。一六二二號力購不已，一四三號九四號亦然，後以塲外一再報高，復傳紗廠增資呼聲高，十時四十分一七一號二三二號三五號一五三號八九號二二四號一四九號一〇五號均進，十時四十分後，遞永紗拉高至七〇八〇元，六一號七七號九五號一〇七號八五號三二號趁高有售，又見下游，八九號一八〇號一六〇號一五二號七七號七八號二二四動　意較濃，港電報升，回跌至六三五〇元。四號三五號一四三號一一九號乘低進至六七〇〇元外，一八〇號等尚加了結，午收在六五五〇元左右掙扎，收後微挫。結果較上週六計永紗信和微升，美亞漲停，勤興新華跌停永公新光景福各跌一成有零。遞交計永紗美亞微挫，信和新光永公跌一成强，景福勤興跌停。冷股榮覺麗安漲停，大通中絲火柴景綸新亞跌停，商務統益水泥跌停後有回，各跌一成有零。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>上塲尚穩，麗安榮豐漲停，八三號二二四號一六〇號二二二號一五五號俱進，遞永紗曾升爲六七一〇元。入後紗廠忽傳罷工，一五四號二一三號二二四號一九〇號六五號一〇九號九四號一〇五號一八五號一八〇號均售，突起跌風。大通永公水泥中絲景福勤興新光中紡統益新華景綸紛告跌停，遞永紗竟步降至六〇國五〇元。九一號三一號一四號二三號八九號來進，升至六三〇〇外，八九號亦進，美亞稍有起色。無奈四行兩局差進四百億，港申電再升爲十八元，火柴由一七號掛停，一九九號九四號一五三號一五四號三六號一五七號二二三號二二四號四號一八三號紛紛了結，臨收前十分鐘，遞永紗亦迫低至限度，除榮豐麗安外，滿堂見黑矣。結果較上週六現交除永紗午後未獲成交，榮豐麗安漲停外，一致跌停。遞交則全部跌至限度，堪外各老股，閘北大生中華見漲，華商五洲平平，餘稍見低。</p>
<h3>外股挫落</h3>
<p>外股昨隨華股爲進退，怡紗晨開七六〇〇〇元，中途回漲至八三〇〇〇元，午收仍退爲七七〇〇〇元。午後港由電再長至十八元，供過於求，遂再跌至七〇〇〇〇元買價結束。結果較上週五計鋼業微挫，航萊會德豐跌半成，英聯怡啤跌一成，怡紗業廣紙業各降成半。</p>
<h3>統價疲跌</h3>
<p>公債昨平疲而已。統丙晨開一五〇〇〇元，自一四六〇〇元升爲一五三〇〇元，最後仍屈居一五〇〇〇元關內，三六〇室有售，五〇三室五五二室則進，成交約五百萬左右。結果較上週六計甲乙跌六百元，丙降五百元，丁挫三百元，戊種獨降八百元。</p>
<h3>經部電令社警二局　徹查黑市紗價</h3>
<p>本市中國紡建公司，歷屆棉紗配價，遠較市價爲低，且不敷原棉成本。近來紗價狂漲黑市猖獗，歷屆配價與黑市價相差總額，竟達六十七億元，但平民未蒙其利，徒使商人中飽，國庫受損。即其他紗廠之出品，原應依照議價出售，但多在黑市出售，而照議價入帳，復使政府减少稅收。按本年度國家總預算中，曾核定該公司應繳盈餘四千億元，詎料且須請求國庫貼補，不得已乃於日前呈請經濟部，速即消滅黑市。今悉該部業已電令本市警局及社局，共同負責調查紡建公司及紡管會配售狀况，並徹查黑市紗價之實際情形，務期紗布交易，趨於正規。</p>
<h3>運漢布　廠商登記　共三十六家三百餘件</h3>
<p>紡管會自上星期開始辦理紗布運往漢口及經過漢口紗布廠商登記以來，前往登記者頗爲踴躍，迄昨已達三百餘件。昨日登記者共三十六家，此一登記，該會定本星期五截止，又北運紗布廠商登記，該會即可審核完竣，日內將發出通知，合格者發給證書，俾憑證設報運云。</p>
<p>昨日紗市，染織廠對二十支紗吸胃甚强。四二支及四十支細紗以府綢已停止織造，去路轉懈。四二支藍鳳一千二百四十甚元，僅升五萬元。廿支特雙馬七百三十萬元，漲十五萬元。雙馬紗做七百十萬元，上漲三十萬元。藍鳳七百二十萬元，上升四十萬元，十六支粗紗去化平淡，價亦平穩。紡建公司照例開紗，價與上期相彷。</p>
<h3>棉布激漲</h3>
<p>棉布市况，因上週六午後塲外交易各布均見挺秀，業中人頗有購進，初開時聞紡建前日供售之三Ａ彩球細布及二等品四君子元嗶嘰，均挨號派售，人心更見興奮。駐滬客帮接踵吸進，又有證券帮之游資加入，致檯面異常緊俏，市勢狂升。十二磅龍頭細布一度升至卅三萬元，旋以獲利出籠，最後回低至三十萬零八千元。較週六猛升二萬三千元，五福彩球等各牌亦漲自一萬四五千至二萬一二千元，其餘漂布斜紋嗶幾及色布士林布等一致狂升，自一萬元至三萬餘元。</p>
<h3>國家行局票據　差入一八八億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來國家行局在票據交換所常見差入，昨日又差入一八八億元，據某專家分析：此項差入，大多係出自外匯續款，政府出售物資，（如紡總公司之紗布，）及稅款之解繳等。渠　：最近物價波動結果，市面流通籌碼，又告不敷，致銀行中之存歡，紛紛流入市面。各行莊在中央銀行之存款，近巳提去總額三分之二，此筆頭寸流入市面後，迄禾回籠。惟渠觀察：最近期內，市面銀根不致鬆動。　二期輸入限額，業巳公布。而近來外匯率調整之說，又甚囂　上，故各進口商亦多紛紛提前結匯，當有大批法幣，將陸續回籠云。</p>
<h3>輪出推廣會討論　補救出口貿易方案　原則已定交中信擬具辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會，於昨日上午十時卅分起，在中央銀行召開會議，到陳光甫·劉攻芸·沈熙瑞·任嗣達·陳雋人·顧問馬格·白益恩等，討論至十二時卅分散會。席間對補救出口貿易之方案，研討頗久，惟尚未獲得定論，今日將再繼續舉行會議。聞關於桐油猪鬃等主要出口物資，近因國內市價高於國外市價出口遂陷於停頓，各地商民，要求當局予以收購補救，俾便統籌外銷。茲悉對補救之道，輸出會方面，業已擬定若干大原則，交由中央信託局根據擬具施行辦法，中信局正着手草擬中，可能提交本日輸出會執委會會議席上討論通過云。</p>
<h3>產地價格高漲　食米追蹤上昇　配給麵粉明日恢復</h3>
<p>昨日南北米市到源共計近萬石左右，市勢以內地猛漲，追蹤上升。粳秈元米一致挺昂萬餘元，惟粉市隨之疲而復振，回漲四五千元，麩皮廠方繼開，漢口有到，實銷仍有，形居平站。</p>
<p>豆餅先漲後平，盤升千元。黃豆依然平淡。</p>
<p>菉豆仍少成交，呆平之狀。赤豆另化轉殷，回漲三五千元。紅糧酒坊暢納，續挺五六千元。苞米靑島動辦蟬聯，飛奔二萬元，收盤見懈。生仁廣銷活靈，續見猛漲萬餘元。芝蔴跟漲三五千元</p>
<p>又訊：本市配售麵粉自上週五起，福新等五麵粉廠以本粉告罄，由糧部決定，今後至新麥登塲爲止，本市配售全由中信局負責。據社局吉科長稱：此項公事十三日抵達市府，昨日社局始告接到，故今日配粉仍暫停，明日起恢復，數量二萬包。其中一萬包爲補足今日者云。</p>
<p>麵粉麩皮籌設市塲</p>
<p>本市麵粉麩皮商業同業公會，昨日下行二時召開會員代表大會。市黨部社會局等主管機關，均派員出席指導，並改選候補理監事。茲將決議案錄誌如次：（一）設立麵粉麩皮市塲案，決議推舉張超，陸元庠，周彥超，李斌元，等十六人爲籌備　　。（二）設置會所案，議決原則通過，具體辦法由零售商聯誼會，及批發商暨全體理監事代表，會商計劃。</p>
<h3>糖價趨勢續緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市以白糖頗有去胃，趨勢續緊。靑赤亦有帶好。公會劃盤，秘魯砂爲四十二萬六千元至二千元，升度近二萬元。台中砂四十萬元，號貨汕提靑二十七萬元，黃崗靑二十六萬五千元。普通棉赤二十七萬五千元，興化白高貨三十九萬元至三十八萬五千元。次三十七萬元。興化赤十九萬元至二十八萬五千元，次之二十八萬元，俱升萬元至五千元。海南亦呌二十七萬元，未成交。</p>
<p>台糧公司考慮　取消議價制度</p>
<p>台糖公司，自從配售食糖以來，其配價向較市價爲低。但至上月間，黑市猖獗，竟超過配價一倍以上。因之一般用戶，未沾實惠，故該公司即告停配。延至前週，經過配價調整後，對於糖商亦予恢復配售。但迄今市價仍超過合法利潤遠甚，故該公司正在考慮取消議價制度，採彈性政策，隨市拋售。詳細辦法正呈請當局審核中。</p>
<h3>標售外銷陳茶　銷去四千箱左右</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局前曾公開標售之一萬餘箱外銷陳茶，際此出口萎頓聲中，問津者並不踴躍。茲悉目前使由怡和洋行，午昌，及大德昌等茶葉公司，共購進四千箱左右，餘則依然無人垂詢。　疲憊多時之洋莊茶市，過程續趨黯淡，蓋因買戶鑒於國外來價慳吝，態度未免趦趄，人心不無杞憂。他若內銷茶，本街店莊及客帮尚有去化，形勢穩定如故。</p>
<h3>油市塲昨晨揭幕　紅盤交易平穩　榨油業購菜籽洽商圓滿</h3>
<p>上海油業市塲於昨日上午十時正式開市，並舉行盛大揭幕典禮。到有機關長官吳市畏代表王冠靑，社會局代表吉明齋，及來賓等百餘人，由張超主席，報告市塲籌備經過。繼由吳市長代表王冠靑致訓，勗勉該業以利己利民利國爲任務，油爲民生主要食物，希望市塲正常發展，抑平市價。後由來賓致詞，至十一時禮成。同業會員即入塲，開始紅盤交易，買賣頗爲平衡，市况殊爲穩定。</p>
<p>昨油市呼吸甚微，生油廣帮續納，再加五六千至萬元。豆油供源尚可，市形平平，淸油胃呆，步削三五千元。菜油彷彿，蔴油亦少榮辱。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市榨油業，爲請中央信託局協助收購菜籽，以充榨油原料計，昨日特由中國植物油廠張德成，大德新周蔚伯，大有餘謝裕祥，同生泰兪良濟等，前往中信局，與該局副局長沈熙瑞洽商進行辦法。洽商結果，殊爲圓滿，已決定按照原定計劃，由中信局協助榨油業，在菜籽生產區期蘇州，平湖，蕪湖等地，推進收溝工作，俾免時機一過，流入囤戶之手，形成圃積商品，而使原料價格高翔。聞收購工作之進行，將由中信局會計處，各地分局及辦事處主任，審計部駐各地辦事處負責人，榨油業推派代表一人，參加共同負責云。</p>
<p>蘭竹枝花苗產地呈歉象</p>
<p>蘭竹枝本屆新花苗，據客方函息，最近已現歉象，故存申之貨未肯賤卸，尚在保守中。惟實銷較稀，暫乏上展希望。</p>
<h3>港匯看高　原料市况挺堅</h3>
<p>黑市港匯，頻頻上昇，原料唯一來源，全恃香港一隅，故人心向榮。昨日下午，交易更盛，各貨脚地彌堅，熱門貨燒碱，Ｎ松香，凡士林等多告挺升，市况仍無小面可看。</p>
<h3>進出口商要求取銷　寄售品限期結匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口及皮毛油骨兩商業同業公會，爲國行限期結售委託銷售貨品事，昨特聯名電呈行政院及經財兩部，籲請取銷該項限期辦法。該呈略稱：華商推廣出口，因貨品高低不一，花色繁多，向採委托銷售辦法，即先運貨出口，委托國內指定銀行轉委國外銀行倉存保管，以便國外購戶，隨時看樣，待價出售，一面由出口商與國外購戶，電洽價格，一經商妥，由國內指定銀行，電告國外委托銀行收款交貨，相沿成習，雙方稱便。不意本年三月間，中央銀行突然規定原有出口貨，一律限五月廿四日前出售結匯，否則令知國外指定銀行執行「不限價」代售。消息傳來，國內出口商，均束手無策。國外市塲，更乘機抑價。竊維輸出增多一分，售價增高一分，吾出口商即可向政府多結一分外匯。反之限期結匯，等於勒令廉價出售，有因時令或需要關係，一時乏人收受，不啻授人以刃，使出口商任人宰割。吾政府或可獲一時少數之外匯，然影響所及，勢將直接迫使出口商破產。間接致土產更趨停滯云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局昨日恢復配售人造絲，按絲織織帶兩樂去年十二月份申請量，（隊絲織聯營公司代織品部份），配四分之一，約合五百餘箱。此次配售，名義上係屬暫借性質。配售天橋每箱五百五十萬，金三馬及東洋每箱五百三十萬，早日及高山每箱五百二十萬，須以即期支票繳付外，尚附收保證金四百萬元，可以期票繳付。俟行政院核定新售價後，多退少補。聞該批配貨，定本週四繳款，本週六可出貨云。</p>
<h3>人造絲市虛弱</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲穩中形疲，一二〇號高山有光一千六百五十萬元開盤，空方稍有吸收，喊價又漸告上升，迄收盤傻爲一千七百萬元，下午最大喊到七百三十萬元，最後退喊六百九十萬元，比上週未跌三十萬元。</p>
<p>昨市廠經交易仍稀，Ｃ字等級上午有十包成交，價做二千零七十萬元，下午亦有數包交易，做開五天期票，價二千零九十萬元，其餘各級喊價，均與上週六相仿，殊乏成交。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨美亞被面喊價八百八十萬元，比上週末大二十萬元，大誠格子璧縐始終在三萬二千元左右盤旋，隔日期二千三百元有人要，冲電力紡產地報價二十六萬元，故由市巳提高一二萬元，其他各貨，俱無上落。</p>
<h3>派力司暢銷</h3>
<p>羽紗呢市上流通頗形缺乏，售價極爲高賣，趨勢且頗俏俐。條子格子素色，求逾供，大多數有行乏市。同業中有限之陳貨，只好應酬自己門市。派力司需供較爲廣暢，頭號每碼齊沽廿六七萬元，二號廿三四萬元，三號二十萬元左右。協新章華寅豐潤豐咸有現定開出，實銷方面，近日以本街華服去路爲多，客帮則多早巳購齊。西服以凡而頂爲盛行，顏色方面以淺灰素色爲活躍，米色者市價較低云。</p>

<h3>猪鬃有人青睞</h3>
<p>外匯匯謠言，仍不絕如縷，市塲方面，多揣測此次參政會，或有建議更動之可能。一般敏感性之大戶，昨市已下手吸收猪鬃，致鬃市均告上或二成，其他出口物資，亦被作爲攫取目的物。</p>
<h3>鮮肉連日騰漲</h3>
<p>鮮肉激漲，拆價已竄出六十二萬元，其原因爲稅與產地價格之增加。但本市每屆夏季，必有一個月之所謂「雷齊素」故銷路銳减，小面行將來臨。</p>
<h3>四聯酌加貸指欵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本年春繭貸欲一千二百億元，因決定計劃時，預算鮮　價在四十萬元一祖。茲以米價高漲，每担已達百萬元之數，故原定貸額，當有未敷。茲經中蠶公司負責人在京與四聯總處方面，洽商結果，四聯總處已允就事實需要酌加貸額。又廠商方面對貸款之一成填額，日內蠶絲產銷協導會將進行催繳云。</p>

<h3>滇南十日</h3>
<p>— 昆明十日航訊　本報特派員徐繼濂</p>
<p>箇舊的錫業確實在走着下坡路，錫商們和當地士紳常常神往於過去的盛境，工人達二十萬人，每年產量近萬噸，這些似乎只能在回憶中閃耀着光輝了。最凋蔽的時期礦工只剩下百多人，每年產量總數還不足二百噸，兩相比較，毋怪乎錫商們不勝唏噓，彷彿有點大少爺落難的情景。</p>
<p>直到民三十四年驀地裏來了幾位美籍採礦專家，在箇舊作了一番實地考察，認爲箇舊錫礦蘊藏量豐富，大有可爲，如此才得重新促醒了人們的注意，是年便訂定了「黃金易錫」的辦法，卅五年錫業情况稍見好轉，可是這終不是長遠的打算，礦業的復興斷不是幾位專家們憑空設計，一時興趣所至便能奏效的；重要的是全面而且縝密的計劃，大量的資本，無盡的勞力和血汗，這樣才能使箇舊錫業昭蘇起　！</p>
<p>箇舊錫業　在昭蘇中</p>
<p>箇舊的產錫　在全世界說來，僅是排在第四位，較諸南洋年產六萬噸之多，未免有小巫見大巫之感，不過南洋一帶均係「砂錫」，而箇舊則爲「脈錫」，成本實在相差太遠，要競爭自不容易，目前我們只有儘量减低成本，運用科學方法開採冶鍊，否則中國的錫業前途是無法敎人樂觀的。</p>
<p>我們在總工程師倪相材（北洋畢業，和陳立夫先生同級，最近曾出席倫敦錫務會議）和協理呂蘭生的講述下，開始對箇舊錫礦區的工程實况有了强烈的興趣，他們兩位都是埋頭苦幹的實踐者，在雲南錫業公司這一機構之下，他們貢獻了全部的精力，較之那些「紙上談兵」的理論家是要實在得多時。箇舊的礦商有民營和公營兩種，當然兩者在資金和方法上都有相當遙遠的距離，民營礦商已經面臨股重的危機了，資金短絀，人力不易，不過一部份人還在努力掙扎，靜待美好的日子來臨。公營礦商此刻便是雲南錫業公司一家，條件當然要優越得多，不過困難一樣不少，錫業公司是二十九年由雲南錫務公司，資源委員會錫務處以及箇舊煉錫公司三個機構接收後合併而成，現在由雲南省政府認股百分之四十，資源委員會及中國銀行各認股百分之三十，增費爲十億元經營，現轄有老廠，馬拉格新廠，選礦廠，鍊錫廠，機械廠各單位。要介紹錫礦的開採與冶鍊，在箇舊，土法是佔有極重要的一席的，它在產量上幾乎佔據百分之九十以上，這次，我們也曾「走馬觀花」地考察了一番，因也願作一點膚淺的介紹；土法一開始的工作便是打洞，當礦主尋得礦脈以後，便依循着路綫先打出槽門（俗稱洞口），各洞尖的深度不一樣，少的數百步，多的達四五千步，於是洞內探礦的工作開始了，工頭們率領着砂丁找尋礦苗，發現礦苗以後，便着手挖塃，以含礦成份之多少而決定取捨，砂丁們背負着五十斤以至百多斤塃包爬出洞來，這一個工作是異常艱苦的，因爲礦洞中窩路崎嶇狹窄，須用杵手扶持，頭頂着煤石燈在洞中佝僂而行，洞中不通空氣，而且常時有雨水浸入，雖有通風及排水設備，只是土法多不考究，因之砂丁們爬出洞口常有量厥者，其狀至慘。</p>
<p>錫礦採出來以後，通稱爲「　」，塃中所含泥土雜質甚多，而且凈礦之成份也不一致，跟着來的第二個步驟便是揉洗，在揉塃整礦的地方設置溜　。主要的設備是洗礦槽，碎　器具和看守房。揉出來的碎塃多半粗大，礦質混合於土石之內，在淘洗以前要使之破碎，土法多用馬拉石磨，注入淸水，磨成泥漿使礦與砂土分離，然後才入槽冲洗。</p>
<p>錫開採後　需要揉洗</p>
<p>碎塃入槽後，工人用水戽冲洗礦塃，另外以長竹竿揉扒，如此泥漿由槽口流出，注入水溝內，塃之重者含礦質較多，便沉積在槽內，至此磚槽揉洗工作完成。接着便是平槽整洗的工作，泥漿及細緻的礦砂均得以順水冲入沉澱池，較粗的礦質便留積在槽內粗細分開後，置於瓢箕在水面上篩動，細砂落於塘內，粗渣另爲堆積，如此到含礦八九成之「礦頭」，便再行放入平槽，用水攪拌，是爲淘礦，，如尚有粗粒礦時，須用馬磨磨之，磨得泥漿注入板槽，使用戽瓢，戽洗數次，便得凈八九成礦。　由揉洗所得的凈礦，便是細粒的錫砂，必須經過爐火的冶鍊，才能成爲整片的大錫，所以熔鍊是大錫生產的最後一個步驟。</p>
<p>最後過程　錫的熔鍊</p>
<p>冶鍊礦砂時計廿四小時爲一爐，每爐可以熔鍊礦砂三石之譜，須栗炭三千斤，爐炭燃燒以後，由工人用鐵鏟將礦砂鏟入土爐甑子中，稱爲上礦，每上礦一次即須加炭一次，上礦時另有工人扯動風箱鼓風送入甑中，使炭火熾烈燃燒，礦砂熔鍊的當兒，火門須隨時打通，免被炭渣阻塞，甑子內已經熔化的錫液，很容易從火門流出，沉積在窩子內，如此煉錫之化學過程，係凈礦入爐以後，遇還原火燄，由酸化錫礦經木炭之還原，而成凈錫與二氧化碳，可以用化學公式表示出來·</p>
<p>SnO2+C——CO2+Sn　　由火門流入窩子內之錫液·２使與炭渣分開，礦砂體輕而微者，常隨火燄上昇，飛積於屋頂及樓板上，必須淸掃和水·再付冶鍊。</p>
<p>窩子內的錫液，用勿擾勺舀入提　齲內，俠冷至相當程度，再用鐵勺提入池內，用小　　刮開錫面，使其平勻光澤，至其冷却　結後，即成錫片，通稱大錫，每條長一尺二寸，寬五寸，厚二寸半，約重五十公斤。</p>
<p>我們在簡舊參觀土法製錫的歷程大致如此，一般私營礦商便還在墨守成法，在默默地埋頭苦幹，雲南錫業公司巳在極力倡導新法，謀儘量運用科學方法，利用機器，避免浪費勞力，以作大規模之生產，承倪總工程師及熊秉信工程師的詳細解說，使我們較有一個明晰的概念。</p>
<p>空中索道　省時省力</p>
<p>首先我們在錫業公司所屬的馬拉格礦山上，實地參觀了他們所開鑿的豎坑，是一個美國工程師恰柏所設計的，深度達三百餘公尺，由曁坑中另外開　平坑，開鑿與採礦都使用機械及科學設備。</p>
<p>新法自然便要進步多多了，我們進入豎坑再轉到平坑，雖然坑內流水潺潺，顯得險冷，但是裏邊巳經使用電燈，舖上輕便鐵道，用　馬擔任運塃的工作，人力巳是附為的地位，而且豎坑內架設了堅牢的昇降機，上下十分方便，不做土法開塃探礦的那麽艱苦和不人這的了。最爲方便而且省時省力的，便是運塃的空中索道，由馬拉格礦山沿老陰山而下，以達洗砂廠，全綫水平距離二二，二六四尺，長度二二，八〇〇尺，記者當天都帶着若千新奇而且恐懼的心理，在空中作了四公里半的旅行，據總工程師告訴我，中國採礦使用空中索道的，除了箇舊錫礦而外，僅只有東北龍洋煤礦一處。不想這一趨倒讓記者們有了一次難得有的冒險嘗試。　錫礦的揉洗在新法上是尤其顯得完密的，有磨礦機，分級器，洗礦床，回礦帶，離心唧筒等項設備。熔鍊的火爐用法國火磚砌成，堅固耐用，此外尚有熔化池，汽水　爐，汽水池，碎礦機，化朧鑪等等，錫業公司工作人員高度地發揮了他們的能力，其工作效率與研究精神，都値得加以讀揚。</p>
<p>然而礦山上永遠追隨着吉難的那一羣砂丁，那些無名英雄更是值得描述的，記者接觸過許多砂丁，將專題作一介紹。</p>
<h3>海外天堂內幕</h3>
<p>— 七日航訊　往仁寄自萊汀市</p>
<p>立在中國，遠望外洋，自覺西方到處有天堂，惟苟從衣食住行，詳加考量，則其內幕，各國自尚不相同，比上不足下有餘，我中國人，正可因以自慰者轉以自勵。</p>
<p>眞正可滿人意之歐洲國家，宜推衣食住行一切無所苦之陰山半島瑞典丹麥與挪威，其中挪威却最佳。</p>
<p>荷國日用食品無所缺，惟南洋羣島之熱帶產品，大抵不可復得，衣則紡織品之限制，自四月起略寬弛，行則因外匯之阻，尚難任意遠遊，住則房屋不易得，非常窘促，冬季缺煤。法國足食足衣，如走黑路，一切皆可得之，生活所需，因此大昂。英國煤荒之厄，向所未有，市上所得之食物分配份量，反比戰期縮减，住屋奇缺，稅甚高而物價亦高，最近政府且因阻止不急之外匯，吸紙捲烟之限制，時予加嚴。蘇俄傳說今秋收穫期一到，麵包之分配限制，可望豁免，住屋尚奇缺，但煤電之供給較多。</p>
<p>波蘭每人一日勤工所得之薪給，不過波幣二百帑，餐館一客之食，乃需五倍於斯之干帑。</p>
<p>義國物價比照戰前一九三八年，加四十倍，而國人所可得之薪，不過加至十三倍。</p>

<h3>四十八屆　國際年市觀光</h3>
<p>— 八日航訊　宏負寄自荷蘭</p>
<p>人生矛盾見雄奇，天意憂勞致泰亭，悟澈盈虛因果理，報償冬瘁有春榮。</p>
<p>春似佳人觀面時，千呼萬喚竟來運，冰霜自有醍醐味，淸夢銀　耐苦思。</p>
<p>以上兩詩係記者專爲荷國古渡（Utrecht）市第四十八屆國際年市（Jaarbeurs）而作。詩中年市春榮，返映著冬寒憔悴之苦。年市復開幕，春到人間矣，然而今春陳賽，比往昔巳展遲一月以上。一九四七年冰季之長與酷寒之甚，爲百年間所希有。早春三月暮，尚復雪地霜天，四十八屆年市特別推擴之宏規，建設進行之難，一一現諸銀幕，其印象之倍見深刻者，有整葺會塲平治道路用自動不需人力之椿地機，有新法建築先成上部後下部，提置列柱頂端，復被大風吹墮之整個屋頂，有顯示會塲棚屋工事完成之屋頂標識，或揚一面小旂，或挿一枝大樹，有開幕前兩星期日夜動工無輟息之忙趕寫景，或爲憧憧照影之人夫，或爲煜煜通宵之爐藝。年市當局招待國內外報人，先此表演，備見人生於世，所遭困迫愈多，所成就者必愈大，精思美喩，大可借「人定勝天』一義，加强努力自助者　鬬之精神，洵勤於事業復興之輩，所當乘時借鏡者也。</p>
<p>彌利演說　歷述荷國經濟</p>
<p>開幕以前，年市總辦彌利（Mr．J．Milius）演說，歷述荷國經濟近况。綜其要義，足資我國之研討者凡五端:（一）大戰而後之荷國，有助生產事業之工人，視前减少，而無裨乎生產之輩忽加多，其中除多數少女，嫁給遠征南洋羣島之軍人，可領贍養費，不必再勤工，又有若干荷女，嫁給坎拿大兵，已離荷國境，無法使動工，致令女工人數，减去一大批外，其男子之可任勤工者，已有十三萬人去從軍，復有二十萬人，因戰期戰後，法令加繁，日用分配局等新機構，逐步增添，紛紛改任差役吏員諸文職，綜上文武兩途合計，因從公而失去生產能力之人，竟多至三十三萬，致令荷全境利於加大生產之男女工人，比照戰前，减去三分之一，同時荷本部十一省之人民，戰後忽爾增至九兆半，比照戰前，反加上百分之八，戰期荷地事物，破壞過多，此輩日常之需，動嗟欠缺，但目前荷本部製產能率，僅等於戰前一九三八年原有製產額百分之八十，而以人民之數忽激增，所短百分之二十，却已等於百分之中缺三十。（二）工薪之求固定不驟增，自是一種至困難之問題，誠以物價漲時，工薪不得不加，工薪若隨意增加，物價必與之俱漲，荷政府爲防此弊，急即想出一條薪路，即使各工廠，趕先多造成本菲薄品質平凡，不求精美而專應家常急需之實惠品，如玻璃器或瓦器，或木質槃榼之製，濟以大量生產，貧無力者，均便購求，此即釜底抽薪，暗阻物價上升之一法。</p>
<p>迅速增產　冀佔海外</p>
<p>（三）爲荷製產品之出口計，須將本國工價成本，與外國同業細相衡量，求其比較最有利之部門，特使進行推廣，但荷工商在國際市塲，戰期戰後，缺席五年之久，其原有之地位，率被他國攘佔，例如世界各地，久已不見荷產之乾酪。澳大利所製產者，往往起而代之。荷產品欲復原狀非易事，所幸鄰國之德，最近尚不能運貨出口，荷工商知機乘時，惟有急起直追，迅先佔取國際市塲德國所有地位，按彼歐洲方面視善經商之華人，恒比爲東方產之荷蘭族，華人如求得向世界市堪占地位，亦宜趁日本貨未能大量出口之際，猛著先鞭，失此不圖，唾臍何及。（四）從來養於商者，欲求多佔海外市塲，首應具旣速且靈之製產能力，荷國近被捲入歐戰之旋渦，向來賴以生產之機器，苟非戰期損壞或遺失，其僅存之物，亦變爲陳舊，對於生產事功，洵不易與人爭勝，工欲善其事，必先利其器，外匯不可多得，機器之新利者，即不容隨意購求，因陋就簡之生產，勉力加功，其勢不速，欲求加多出口額，換取外匯以置新機器，談何容易。（五）海外貿易新戰略，如英吉利之羊毛，愛爾蘭之亞麻布，法之香水（譯音曰百芳Darfum）時裝，丹麥之銀飾，瑞典之玻璃業，大抵聯合全國同業爲一起，向彼美洲等幷力進行，如是則交際宣傳，消費較少而收效特鉅，衆　易舉，荷國見　心喜，尚思踵而效之，中國財力更微，自更不容單槍匹馬，深陷入羣雄角逐之重圍也。</p>
<p>參加單位　二千五百餘家</p>
<p>同時參觀會塲，計本屆年市，國外工商界之爭先參加者，二千五百十四家，所占地積，增至三萬三千八百十五平方公尺，實爲已往四十七屆得未曾有之盛觀，其因報到遲而額滿見遺者五百家，在塲預賽之行號機關或社團，除荷本國一千三百八十家之外，更有外來者之十九國，分別計之，英二六八家，美二〇一家，瑞士一四八，比一四七，法一三七，捷克一一八，瑞典三十二，丹麥二十九，義國二十，其餘德，澳，匈，坎拿大，螺堡，那威，埃及，澳洲，播來（即猶太）並葡國，各三數家不等。</p>
<p>會塲中，如紡織門會塲及玩具門陳賽，二者明麗矞皇，最足昭示年市之偉大。</p>
<p>年市『報人』宴，設於三百六十年老店北荒州館Hotel　Noord－Brabant之中，是館宏厦，建於距今四十二年前之光緒乙巳，善加文飾，望之若新，坐中插話，妙緒環生，荷全國記者會主席希氏Ａ．Ｓchilp致詞，謂如洛塘新建大戲院，起而促進闔市之繁昌，如年市酒宴廣集商界名流，　有我報壇同業華箋佳什，相映半輝，俱見經濟與文化之同功並通，次日予詩及貝氏言，均載入大應鄉Groop　Arobem日刊．</p>

<h3>美國新聞處　唱片音樂會記</h3>
<p>— 梁酉延</p>
<p>唱片音樂會在西洋及日本，早已流行，但在中國，仍然是很新的玩意兒。</p>
<p>這音樂會旣便於舉行，又可以介紹世界已故名家或現貢名家的作品及演奏，它的意義與其說是娛樂的，不如謂爲文化的，敎育的。這音樂會爲你排好了節目，又爲你逐一加以說明；閉住了眼睛靜聽，彷彿置身在盛大的音樂會中，雖然那聲音是靠機器而再現、却仍然令你覺到是活生生的藝術。</p>
<p>十六日黃昏，我參加了美國新間處的唱片音樂會，它讓我聽到了世界有名樂隊（美國家廣播公司樂隊）的演奏及當代名指揮托斯卡尼尼指揮下的名曲。</p>
<p>那天，一共唱了莫扎特，條伯特等三大名家的曲子，由美使館斯培曼爾先生担任說明。浪奏前，室內擠滿了中外籍的音樂迷，但却恬靜得連人們呼吸聲息都聽得出來，這說明他們的音樂水準及對藝術的熱誠。</p>
<p>我最愛的是第二節——莫札特的長笛與豎琴（Harp）的競奏曲。這曲子，我已好久無法聽到。那長笛，正像小提琴，但聲韻比小提琴更柔和而光彩；那豎琴正如鋼琴，但比鋼琴更淸脆而活潑，餘韻悠長。這也許因爲：以長笛豎琴協奏的曲子不多，而像莫扎特那樣的富麗光輝的曲調也不多，而在上海又不容易聽到豎琴的演奏。</p>
<p>豎琴，這是最原始的樂器，同時由於屢次的改革的結果，其用途雖不如鋼琴之廣，但其「身價」，顯然的並不比鋼琴低。目前，在上海是不易找到豎券的名手的。</p>
<p>因此在我國餓的音樂「感應力」中，我說不出對於這一節目的如何傾倒。在休息時間，我說了句歪曲的批評：「這曲子比剛才更好！」不料隔座的一位外籍朋友，馬上正經地糾正了我：「你至多只能說，你更喜歡這個，至於這些名曲中，那一個更好，是無法輕下定論的。」</p>
<p>但是，我的確被這一隻長笛豎琴的競奏迷住了。</p>
<p>自唱片音樂會歸來，我只覺得我們這般音樂愛好者太飢餓了！渴望着能有更多的機會，聽到名家名樂隊的音樂。「剎那謝塵寰，此恨長留黃歇浦；</p>
<h3>宣春江畔</h3>
<p>— 袁猿</p>
<p>「刹那謝慶實，此恨長留黃歇浦；更番揮涕淚，他年憑弔富春江。」</p>
<p>這是當年我輓郁曼陀先生的一副對聯，郁先生於民國二十八年十一月爲敵僞狙擊於上海，那時我正在香港，噩耗傳來，適値颱風來襲，風狂雨驟，畫晦如夜，其後在滬公祭，我就送了這樣一副輓聯去。這一直等到八年後的民國三十六年暮春，纔有機會到富春江去憑弔一番。富春江的山光水色依舊這樣明媚，富春江邊的松筠別墅却已沒有當年的亭館之勝，斷垣殘瓦，刻畫了飽經戰事的傷痕。這松筠別墅的主人就是郁曼陀先生，他的弟弟達夫，也在這次戰事裘死在國外。舊地重來，怎能不更番揮涕淚呢？</p>
<p>本米我的所謂更番揮涕淚，原也不過是這樣一句話。當時光父已客死昆明，又接曼陀之耗；更番揮涕淚云，無非爲老父，爲曼能。却不料這番回浙，還要爲達夫而揮涕淚。靑山依舊，碧水長流，而我們所熟知的人却已不在了。看着淸澈的江水，看着寂寂的鸛山，怎麼不涕淚縱橫呢？</p>
<p>富陽人爲紀念這兩位郁先生，於上月十六日爲曼陀建衣冠塚於　山之麓，又爲達夫建紀念碑。本來，達夫自有可紀念的地方在，這一塊碑的建立，不過表示富陽人民對於達夫的紀念，對於達夫的崇敬而已。至於曼陀先生的高風亮節，爲國捐軀，在我們這次民族戰爭中實是件英烈的故事，足以流傳千古。如今當陽的人民旣已爲曼陀舉行公葬，面殺害郁先生的奸逆却還沒有繩以國法。我們看　山之釐的新塚，又怎麼能不再番感慨呢？</p>
<p>暴陀身前與章行嚴先生交誼至　，時行嚴先生擬有遼瀋之行暴陀爲詩以尼之。我已記不得全詩，不過開頭幾句還深印在我的腦中：「垂老依人强自雄，料從　後識焦桐，深知耆舊能議國，民旣公葬曼陀於鸛山，行嚴先生篤念舊交，爲撰衣冠塚碑記。文字船若，河山比壽，想來行嚴先生落筆之際，感觸多端，亦必老淚縱橫，同爲國家民族一哭。</p>
<h3>「過去」——凄惋的回想</h3>
<p>— 許謹</p>
<p>雖說是春寒，桃花仍然開滿了枝頭，一陣春雨過後，園子裏像被淋浴過一般淸爽，紅花綠葉更顯得嫵媚動人，麻省和小鳥，都鼓起了牠們底舌簧。隨着春風，桃花正聽得入神，却禁不住　落下了幾滴粉淚，像惋惜這濃艷的春光，將跟着寒氣悄然地埋葬了！</p>
<p>魏德曼路上，那班年靑的兒女正在盡性地踏着春光閒逛，他們心上泛着一縷春色惱人的情緒。</p>
<p>十年前深刻的印象，又在她底腦海裏激起了凄惋底回想：短暫的，十年前的影子哪！</p>
<p>她和新愉快地在一個私人的墓園裏遊覽，走過園中的小石橋，溪水緩緩地流着，玫瑰和丁香放着一陣陣沁人欲醉的香氣。繞過一座小小的石山，迎面就看見那塊豎立着的石碑，碑上嵌着一個美麗的女孩子的像，兩條長長的辮子，從肩膀上拖埀在胸前，含情默默地雙眸，從娟秀的眉宇問看出了她被環境逼迫成的憂鬱·石碑上刻着她的名字，寫着她的身世。裘麗，　十　就進了一個聖母院，天天　着姆姆們背誦聖經，或者做祈禱，經過了半年短短的歲月，就因急性腦膜炎症死亡了。讀完了那篇墓銘以後，她禁不住心頭湧上了一股辛酸，她不瞭解爲什麼這末小小的孩子就被送進了修道院裏去。</p>
<p>她默然地苦思着，找不着答案。新挽了妙的手臂，離了石碑走過小石橋，玫瑰和丁香依然放着奇香，小溪的水依然平靜地緩緩地流着，花　中的小鳥撲撲毛羽，又飛向茂林中去。</p>
<p>迎面看守墓園的老人，　着長長的竹烟斗向園內走來，她便請他叙述裘麗的故事。老人想了一想，然後囁嚅着說：</p>
<p>「裘麗的母親是一個名門閎秀，可是愛上了一個靑年，便生下了裘麗，因爲不容於家庭，被驅逐了出來。她和那靑年的愛情，又不知怎的斷絕了，後來飄零到一個鳥嶼上，終於跳海自殺了。遺留下的裘麗是被一個姆姆帶領着的，這樣她就在修道院裏做了聖女…………」</p>
<p>啊！孩子呵！原來是替她的父母揹起了十字架，鈸住了天眞活潑的心靈，禁錮在幽靜的深院裏。</p>
<p>她聽了老人的敘述，悲愴地偎着新，像在抽泣。</p>
<p>然而那善於那感傷的心，經過了十年的創傷和磨折，她　重遊舊地的今天，墓園的一草一不已不復尋到過去的痕跡。在敵人踐踏過的瓦礫邊，緣茵和野花已舖遍了四周，她眸望着雨後的靑天，長長地喘了一口氣：「過去」祇是一個深刻的夢呵！</p>
<h3>聖母與聖嬰</h3>
<p>聖母與聖嬰，是十三世紀末葉之牙彫代表作。一般彫刻母子像，多取坐姿，唯此作爲利用象牙之形，刻成立像。彫工細膩，表情尤佳，冠髮以及披風之花邊，皆貼有金色，冠上鑲有五彩寶石和真珠，除去肌肉部份爲象牙色外，餘者分染淡彩，沉着雅麗，甚爲別緻。現存法國巴黎羅佛美術館。法人視之爲「國寶」。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　513</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「喂！」鶴見希望這打來的是李明或守一的電話，他可利用談話，做一個客觀條件。然而不巧得很，電話中傳來的乃是日本語，是正岩打來的，並且語調十二分緊張徨急。這麼一來，把鶴見的現有感覺，立刻轉移到另一個陣地上去了。</p>
<p>這個電話，佔據了相當長的時間。在問答之下，鶴見還慌忙火急，抓起紙筆，很細心的記了一些下來。電話的內容，也相當複雜；正岩應用種種隱語，種種日常題材，把這複雜的消息，樓細說明；並且吿訴鶴見，他這時還須守候其他消息，一時無法脫身。</p>
<p>根據鶴見記下的要點，歸納起來，共有三種：</p>
<p>一，東京「〇十二」所收緊的消息，據參本部軍事會議所議決的，長谷川淸，已正式晋升出征大陸海軍司令，他本人名下的第十第十一兩大艦隊，包括第五水雷隊，和前綫第十水上飛機大隊，等等，俱已升火整裝待發，只候近衛簽署出發令，預料大約第二天拂曉以前，就要浩浩蕩蕩，殺到全中國經濟心臟的上來，最後目標，乃是南京的「城下之盟」！</p>
<p>二，松井石根已經受任遠征派遣軍司令，他第一個指令，乃根據「八之秘密」計劇，着上海·南京·廣州·武漢·等區的「潛」「明」兩種武力攻勢，同時在八月一日「拂曉」吉時，（大陸時刻）一律發動，限兩例星期，達到預定計劃的佔領範圍，强迫「支那現中央政府」屈膝！</p>
<p>三，自稱「東方勞倫斯」的土肥原賢二，這個蘭組的間諜魔首，不滿意現下日本間諜網組織，所以聯絡了軍部智囊之一磯谷兼介，和恐怖之王的黑龍會東方執行部首腦齊坂虎太郞，聯名上書給參謀本部和近衛，打算把間諜機構總改組。他說只要參謀本部通過這提案，他有本領在全部間葉組織裏，作一個總淸理；拿恐嚇，暗殺，作武器，來達到他統一組織的目的。</p>
<p>這三個消息，第一二兩條，顯然表示中日兩國戰禍之火，迫在眉睫，鶴見素以消弭這個戰禍爲責任，於今這個大禍，已經眼見有九成九分成了事實，可見他一切努力，俱擲虛牝，內疚到了萬分，是不用說的了。那第三條，尤其是個切身的恐怖；那土肥原如眞的辦到了改組目的，第一個受到摧折的，當然就是鶴見本人和他的秘密組織了。換句話，從此以後，他想再像以前那般活動，利用通訊機構，作種種反間諜活動，顯然不可能了。不僅如此，他本人的活動，土肥原也許有些知覺，至少，鶴見是他限中的一根刺；這「淸算」一着，未嘗不是瞄準鶴是見而擲的一個致命炸彈。這樣，不僅鶴見的事業，要一描而光；甚至他本人的性命，也操在土肥原手裏了。就是萍子這次在上海，無端失踪，也未嘗不是敵人下的一個警吿。</p>
<h3>水影</h3>
<p>— 友琴</p>
<p>當你低着頭向水淸見底的溪瀾中照見你的面影時，你有些什麼念頭沒有？靑的天，白的雲，山峯和樹枝的倒影，陪襯着你的一張淸　的面龐。你感到寂寞呢？神秘呢？悠然的詩味呢？湛然的哲理呢？請有以語我來！</p>
<p>「人莫鑑於流水，而鑑於比水，」當然在流動的時候，水是不能替你照見淸朗的面貌的，而同時你的心也不能靜止，你自然就看不見己以及自己眼中一切的陪襯物了。</p>
<p>詩人慣作秋水眼波等辭語，眼觀水，水觀心，水是澄澈的，眼是澄澈的，心是澄澈的，然後一切皆澄澈。反之有一渾濁，則一切皆渾濁，有一陣礙，則一切皆障礙。</p>
<p>小時候讀伊索寓言：有狗行過橋，口啣一肉，見水中一狗亦口啣一肉，便頓起貪心，狺然而吠，不幸自己口中之肉亦因之而失。此狗的眼睛是並無障礙的，橋下之水也是澄澈的，可惜狗的心未免渾濁了，結果眼與水皆失其作用。眞亦爲幻，幻亦爲歧，狗有何知，能不由狺狺而悵悵嗎</p>
<p>世人相馬，常有「你要把眼睛放明亮點！」的話頭，其實單靠眼睛明亮，亦復何用！眼光越明銳的人，有時越不由自己做主，「臣門如市，臣心如水」的人物，在這個世界上似乎並不多，所謂「如水」當然是如澄澈之水，眞正「一淸如水』，纔能見物見心，否則，未有不如伊索寓言中之狗見肉影者。</p>
<p>楞嚴經，「月光童子言，我憶往昔，有佛名爲水天，敎諸菩薩，修習水觀，入三摩地，我於是時，初成此觀，但見其水，未見其身，嘗於比邱室中安禪，我有弟子，窺窗觀室，惟見淸水遍在室中，了無所見，童稚無知，取一瓦礫，投於水內，激水作聲，顧盼而去，我出定後，頓覺心痛，爾時童子來前，說如上事，我則吿言，汝更見水，可即除去瓦礫，童子奉教，後入定時，開門除之，我復出定，身質如初」。</p>
<p>我們不是入定僧人，不曾做「修習水觀」的工夫，可是心水之中，着一些礫不得，芷和眼中着一些灰塵不得是一樣的。瓦礫投水，即是投心，須請童子投石礫者立即開門，除去瓦礫，「解鈴還是繫鈴人」，必如是，方可使「身質如初」。</p>
<p>我是不懂得什麼佛理的，也毫無學佛的企圖，然而我看到水，由水以觀心，我希望當我照影時，沒有童子投瓦礫到水中，攪亂我的淸麗的面龐，以及靑的天，白的雲，山峯樹枝等等陪襯着的跡象，讓我能淸淸楚楚地看見自已一下。</p>
<p>「何處低頭不是我，四方同此水中天」，蘇子瞻的詩句到底是値得玩味的。</p>
<h3>啄木篇</h3>
<p>— 孟農</p>
<p>「爪利嘴還剛，殘陽啄更忙，千林　如盡，一腹餒何妨。形小過槐陌，聲高近草堂，豈能同燕雀，惟解占高梁。」——「本草」。</p>
<p>四月來了，森林的醫師呵，你帶着剝剝的聲音也來了！</p>
<p>聽！滿林都是一片剝剝聲！我雖然不知道你在那裏，可是我確實知道在樹　所在之處，便是你這可愛的森林的醫師足跡所到的地方。</p>
<p>憑着剝剝的聲音，我可以追踪到你的身影：雄偉的頭頂上的紅毛，暗綠的尾羽，桃色的面顏，鈎狀的長爪，刺針一樣的舌尖，最鮮明動人的是：你往往露出紅艷艷的一襠，或是展開暗綠的雙翅，不斷地，反覆地響弄着剝剝的鼓音，像是單調，其實却是重實，清澈，朗爽！</p>
<p>吿訴我，你這神秘的森林的醫師！你是怎樣賦予以聲樂上的魔力，在密林中間，在枯木中間，剝剝地，剝剝地，如此單調，却又如此重實，淸澈而朗爽？你可是從「不周山」的頂巔上飛下來的嗎？你可是從「燧明之國」飛下來的嗎？你可是從「日月之都」漂流出來的嗎？</p>
<p>這些想像都不是憑空吊下的。我看到古代的史籍，它早已在數千年前爲你做過可靠的傳記。「路史」說：「不周之巔，有宜城焉，日月火所不屆，而無四時昏畫之辨。有聖人者，游於日月之都，至於南埀。有本焉，鳥啄其枝，則然出，聖人感之，於是仰察辰心，取以出火，作鑽燧，別五木以改火。」這樣地，我想像着你也許是燧人氏的先導；不，你也許就是燧人氏的化身吧？雖然我在一部老古的神話，呌做「拾遺記」裏看到「不識晝夜」的「燧明之國」，據說那邊有燧木，有烏類啄其枝，火從枝上閃出。又據說一位聖人由於鳥的啓示，便開始摹做牠發見了　木取火的方法，這就成爲了歷史上有名的燧人氏的來歷，但這畢竟是一樁神話，我怎麼能把神話看做信史？你雖然不是神，却是一個具體的存在，我曾親限看見你的實，聽見你的啄音，領略你的工作！</p>
<p>你的單調而又淸一　爽的啄音，喚起了我對於希臘神話中的另一個神的嚮往之情。那也許是你的親愛的異族兄弟，他的名字呌做普洛米修（Prometheus），據說他爲了人類的生存，曾不惜向天帝挑戰，大胆地做了盜火者，從天上帶給大地，帶給可憐的人間，而自己就因此遭到了天上所無同時是人間所罕見的苛刑，終於被擊在荒凉的巉巖上角，讓自己的寳貴的血肉，餵飽了食婪，麻木，陰險，卑汚的牲畜們和駕們的胃肚！這一幅幅壯麗慘烈的圖畫，都憑着你的淸澈的啄音而明顯地幻成原形了。</p>
<p>你的剝剝之聲，也許是一種充滿着悲憫和仁慈的呼聲吧。你是怕啄傷了天下的良木嗎！你巡迴地飛旋在林中不怕疲勞嗎？哦！你是正在尋覓那巳蠢或易蠢的樹木吧？不消一瞬的光陰，那些已蠢或易蠢的樹本便給你的銳敏的視覺，聽覺和嗅覺探察出來了。你這時才使用你的長舌，剛爪，利嘴，鈎出蠢虫來，甚至連頑惡的幼蟲也不放過。在剝的聲音中，任何害蟲都無法隱藏下去。從這裏看出了你眞正的仁慈，看出了你所執行的普洛米修一般的神聖的行動！</p>
<p>同時，你還懷着普洛米修同樣的壯烈的精神。當你把一處的蠢蟲啄盡的時候，你便奮翅飛去—飛向山的外邊，或飛向海的彼岸，你爲了啄盡天下的蠢虫，居無定處，席不暇暖，只是到處漂泊，漂泊，於是，你的剝剝之聲，也就到處蠢個不停，響個不停！</p>
<p>剝剝聲，響在天之涯，響在海之角，響在山頭，響在樹頂，同時，響在我的心頭，而且，響在我的筆底。</p>
<p>「剝剝」……「剝剝」……</p>
<p>單調而又淸澈朗爽的聲音！</p>
<h3>從推事索詐說起</h3>
<p>— 虛舟</p>
<p>永嘉地方法院推事羅某，近串通其妻弟向罪犯瞿玉書索詐木器一付，手錶一隻，賀幛一方及現款三百餘萬元，始准交保釋放。報上登出這新聞的標題是「知法犯法」，其實法院推事豈僅是知法者，司法者犯法，照例是罪加一等的。</p>
<p>關於貪汚的故事，歷史上多得很，大約元朝末年是貪汚之風最盛行的年代，據吳哈先生考證，這是因爲蒙古色目人渾渾噩噩，根本不懂「廉恥」是什麼意思之故。所以在那時候，要錢的名目特別多；大員到任時，下　參見要「拜見錢」，無事白要呌「撤花錢」，逢節有「過節錢」，作生日要「生日錢」，管事而要呌「常例錢」，送往迎來有「人情錢」，差役提人要「　發錢」，上衙門打官司要「公事錢」。要錢的名目如此多，老百姓就個個變成貪官汚吏口邊的魚腥了。據說在從前，皇宮中宮女們不免也要偸漢子，一個肥壯的男人常會被弄得精瘦，終於給趕了出去。這趕出去的嬴弱的男子，在一般人眼里就是「藥渣」——藥給淑女們吃掉了，藥渣也給倒出來了。和這情形相似的是，貪官汚吏眼中的老百姓，也決不是五官四肢俱全的人類，而只是一隻隻的荷包，如果擠榨一下，就可能從中挖出幾個大錢來的。地獄末要錢的名目雖多，但犯人交保釋放時，不知是否必須繳「交保錢」？若然，則永嘉羅推事的索詐倒是師法元末蒙古色目人的故事的了，嗚呼！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>失嫁何其多</h3>
<p>— 葉潤</p>
<p>最近參加了一個校友會，談了許多的舊話。校長光生要校友們谷人塡一個表，其中有已婚未婚一欄。結果發現我們這一級中已經有了光生的，祗佔五分之二。我們離開學校已有十年之久，普通年齡都在三十歲以上了。</p>
<p>何以失嫁的人會這樣多呢？受過高等教育，自是一個原因。在我們這批中學同學之中，有一部又受了大學或專科敎育。這些人在選擇配偶的時候，範圍比較狹小，而且因爲高等敎育時期一長久，又躭擱了一些光陰。然而多數同學都是中學畢業回到了家庭裏而，或者走進　！業圈子，這些人的婚姻對象奕該比較廣大，可是結果却同樣的困難。</p>
<p>失嫁的責任當然不在女子本身。她們並沒有太高的眼界。同時以她們的才貌品性而論，也不愁沒有人追求。問題似乎在於男子方面，目抗戰開始以來的十年之中，流離顚簸的生活使男子不敢娶妻。兵荒馬亂之中連已結合的尙不免分散，豈肯憑添一個家室之累。這是就環境而論。</p>
<p>至於經濟方面，影響尤大。從抗戰中期直到現在，物價始終在繼長增高，使生活日見困難。一個靑年如果沒有特殊的好收入，他實在祗能做一個自了漢，沒有成家的資本，此種情形，在上海尤爲明顯，不說別的，單看一個住的問題，就够一個靑年失去結婚的勇氣。他旣要結婚，就必須與父母分居，另外找（至少）一個房間。現在找一個房間是多麼困難，更不說什麼裝修與家具了。</p>
<p>「日奴米滅，何以家爲？」這種心理在抗戰時期在所難免，勝利以後應該消失，可是有些靑年却抱定宗旨，以爲「事業來成，何以家爲？」更有些人在抗戰期間失學，現在需要補足起來，也使他們遲遲不肯結婚。這些心理連同上述經濟與環境等等原因，遂使靑年們把婚姻大事躭擱下來，延誤了多少姊妹們的佳期。這個損失是否單是姊妹担當着呢？恐怕未必。再進一層問，現代靑年是不是應該屈服於上述種種原因而就此把婚姻擱置下去呢？這樣擱置下去利弊又如何呢？筆者希望留心社會問題的人們加以注意。</p>
<h3>落花無情</h3>

<h3>各種冷飲的來歷</h3>
<p>— 中立</p>
<p>冰凍咖啡是阿比西尼亞人首創的，他們將咖啡豆烘焦，粗劣地磨成粉來，冲成飲品，中加以備　半年的冰塊，而成最初的冰凍咖啡。直到十二世紀，阿拉伯人才學得此法，至於英。法則更暹三百年了。</p>
<p>冰洪淋據元世社時公元一二七五年意人馬哥李羅著的珍奇書中說，他在中國會吃過冰凍結的糕。</p>
<p>冰凍巧克力，則是墨西哥人最先發明的，時間還是當十六世紀西班牙以武力壓迫墨西哥的前幾世紀了。</p>
<p>冰水在一世紀中葉就成爲羅富人解暑品之一，不過他們還不會造冰，祗有建造巨大的冰窰來儲藏它。</p>

<p>甲女：你今天喉嚨怎麼這樣啞？</p>
<p>乙女：是啊，我的丈失昨晚回來太遲了。</p>
<h3>從自殺看社會</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>市警局公佈了四月份的自殺案件，其中因生計困難而自殺的佔絕多數，計百分之二十六。如果我們將家庭糾紛，疾病這兩個自殺原因，擴大至加入生計困難的一項（因爲好些家庭確因爲生計困難　成糾紛，而疾病更無疑的多由經濟窮乏所致），則自殺的比例亦擴大至百分之六十七（見十七日各報本市新聞欄）。這是一個怎樣可怕的社會現象！</p>
<p>這一個統計吿訴我們第二個的注意點，就是自殺的多是靑年人，十九歲到二十九歲的佔百分之四六。第三個値得注意的，就是自殺的多受過敎育，將中等敎青和初等敎育合併一道，受敎育者的自殺佔百分之五十六。</p>
<p>這一個統計說明了什麼？一句話：就是當前知識靑年的失業問題，而且是相當嚴重的問題。這證諸社會部上海職業介紹所發表失青年的登記與介紹，也可得同一的結果。</p>
<p>生命是人生唯一的價值，什麼都由於生命的價值而發生其他的作用，所以自殺決不是人所願意的。但是到了生活無法掙扎時，生命不但失了意義，而且也失了動力。即使你不加以自殺，也將至於被殺。這當中只是時間的短矩離而已。嚴格的說，那些因飢寒而死的，營養不良而夭折的，實在也是一種自殺，只是慢性的，看不見的，沒有血的罷了。</p>
<p>我們說過，生命是最寳貴的；而靑年的生命，尤其是知識靑年的生命更加寳貴，今日靑年以最取寳貴的生命自毀了，慘痛自然無可倫比，嚴童亦難想像。這不但是張三，李四的生命的損失，也是社會民族的災難。因爲一個二三十歲的知識靑年，社會對他的敎養無形的曾盡了相當的担負，現在他的喪生，就社會說，有等於一回完全蝕本的買賣。如果這項買賣繼續的蝕本，那商人就非整個破產不可！</p>
<p>知識青年自殺之多，一方面見出社會不景氣，使青年無謀生之路；另一方面則說明中國敎育破產，靑年學生無法在社會上立足。眞的說，現在的知識靑年，他們旣不能拉車又不能肩挑，說技術，又沒有特長，這樣要不失業，便非有特殊的人事關係不可了。</p>
<p>今日知識　青年的路是非常狹窄的了。我們要求掙扎和開路，不是空言堅持奮鬥所能成功的。社會固該安定，敎育更該改良。最要緊的，我們不要成爲一個不能生產的游民，必須做一個　蜜的工蜂。有工作就有生計，且可望改善生計，這樣自殺庶可减少了。</p>
<h3>記盛宣懷</h3>
<p>— 半衰</p>
<p>盛宣懷爲晚淸第一貪吏，生前揮　無度，死後遺其子孫者猶數千萬，在彼時殊駭人聽聞，說者謂盛氏爲李鴻章一手提拔，固不訛，特盛之所以置身於　腴之地，督辦全國鐵路，與其謂是李力，無密謂是張之洞之力。（亡羊錄詳其事）初中日戰後凝和，鴻章威望大挫，朝野以攻盤李氏爲時髦，盛爲　之親信，被攻尤力。遂有開去天津路，交南北洋大臣查辦覆奏之旨命，時王文韶任北洋大臣，隱袒盛，欲爲開脫，令謁張之洞乞情，時張爲南洋大臣也，　旣抵鄂，方　嚅道所求，張炮止之，明日出二褶稿示盛，一劾之，于保舉之，盛詢何意，汝能爲吾接　湖北鐵路局，吾即保汝，　張目接辦鐵政局後，耗六百萬金，而一無成績，京中切責，張頗彷徨，知盛健於設計，且饒於資·擬令墊款接辦，盛立諾，但要求張氏保其兼辦鐵路，俾可就近統制，使局中所出之鐵，得有消路，張不得已，亦允之，朱期月，張與王文韶會銜覆奏，不第爲其洗刷過去，且保之爲全國鐵路督辦兼爲廠事，淸廷固顢預，榮　等復納巨賄，此盛後來所以敢恣意而行，肆無忌憚也。</p>
<h3>名曲介紹</h3>
<p>— 克諦</p>
<p>最後的眼淚（Last　Tears）</p>
<p>「最後的眼淚」是一首出色而非常著名的抒情歌曲，不但已經成爲波希米亞（今稱「捷克斯拉夫」）底一首燴灸人口的民歌，至今且爲聲樂家們常愛歌唱的名曲，作曲者是一個著名的「戲劇化的女高音」（Dramatic　Soprand）黛斯登夫人（MmeDestinn）。</p>
<p>這首歌曲的內容是敍述一對戀人的故事：他們預知愛情將吿終了，於是在一個　暗的黎明，當他在其戀人門前吿別時，他吿訴她這悲慘的日子將要到來以後，便熱淚盈眶地悄然離去。這最後的限淚，遂在她的心中永記不忘。</p>
<p>歌曲開始時，用一段類似合唱的絃律進行，顯示一對戀人當悲哀的日子到來時的恐懼之情，非常動人。他以歌聲重溫着許多甜蜜的往事：共舞之樂，最初的情話，以及他們所生的愛女和一切的幸福。結尾時用一段哀婉動人的絃律，緩徐咽抑以終，使人聽了，不禁悲從中來。</p>
<p>牛者之歌（Toreador　Song）</p>
<p>法國歌劇大作曲家此才（Ｇ．Bizet）有一個舉世知名而且爲人熱愛不衰的歌劇，那就是雄壯有力的「卡而　」（Carmen），而這裏我所介紹的「鬬牛者之歌」，就是「卡而門」中最出名的一首男次中音（Baritone）唱的「詠歎調」（Aria），爲男主角杜雷多爾在「卡而門」第二幕中旅舍一塲時所唱。那時候，女主角卡而門正同她底一　吉卜賽友人在旅苦中狂歡地載歌載舞，杜雷多爾來了，他在她們的歡呼聲中，用這特別著名的詠歎調，對她們講述鬥牛時的一種驚喜奇險的情緒和狀態。</p>

<p>骨氣則負棱棱之角，加因不能苟合，乃至不能取容。</p>
<p>照目前的現狀，「進化」下去，我看骨氣勢必爲福氣擊倒，一個個心實體胖。社會上世界上都是胖子，也無屑有組織胖子會的麻煩。</p>

<h3>The People's Political Council Assembly Opens Today; Chairman Chiang Will Personally Deliver a Speech; Zhang Qun Will Attend the Afternoon Report</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] The Fourth National Political Council, Third Plenary Session, will open in Nanjing on the 20th. The opening ceremony will be held at 10:00 am, with Zhang Boling as Chairman, and Yu Bin representing all council members to deliver a response. The ceremony will be simple and solemn, singing the national anthem, paying three bows to the national flag and the portrait of the founding father of the nation. The chairman will deliver a speech, followed by the speech of the chairman of the National Government, and the response of the council members, ending with music. Starting at 3:00 pm, President Zhang Qun will personally attend and give a political report to the assembly. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when the National Political Council holds the opening ceremony on the 20th, the heads of the diplomatic missions of various countries stationed in Nanjing will attend the ceremony.</p>
<p>This assembly is the second assembly after the victory, the first assembly after the return to the capital, and the first assembly held in Nanjing. The Second Assembly of the Fourth Session was held in Chongqing on March 20, 1946, one year and two months ago. In the meantime, due to the convocation of the National Assembly and the reorganization of the National Government, it has been repeatedly delayed until now. Some say that this assembly is the last assembly, but according to the bi-annual meeting regulations, there may be a final assembly before the convening of the constitutional National Assembly.</p>
<p>The Assembly Schedule is Scheduled for Two Weeks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] The assembly schedule of the Political Council is scheduled for fourteen days (including the week). The opening ceremony will be held on the morning of the 20th, and the political report will be held in the afternoon. The financial report will be held on the morning of the 21st, and the social and judicial administrative reports will be held in the afternoon. The foreign affairs report will be held on the morning of the 22nd, and the food and agriculture and forestry reports will be held in the afternoon. The transportation report will be held on the morning of the 23rd, and the military and internal affairs reports will be held in the afternoon. The education report will be held on the morning of the 24th, and the economic and post-war relief reports will be held in the afternoon. The meeting will be adjourned on Sunday, the 25th. The review meeting will be held on the 26th morning and afternoon, the review meeting will be held on the 27th morning and afternoon, the review meeting will be held on the 28th morning, the general meeting will be held on the 29th, 30th, and 31st, the meeting will be adjourned on Sunday, June 1st, the general meeting will be held on the morning of the 2nd, and the closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon. In addition, the Executive Yuan will hold a tea party at 4:00 pm on the 25th to entertain the council members, and Chairman Chiang will host a reception at the Lixinshe at 7:00 pm on the 28th. As of the eve of the opening of the assembly, no proposals have been submitted by the council members. The deadline for proposals is noon on the 23rd. It is reported that there are many proposals this time, because the council members believe that this assembly is the last assembly, and they all want to express something, but the focus of the proposals is to hope for stability in national affairs, that is, to call for peace and economic stability.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Fifty-six council members registered on the 19th, for a total of 246 people. Qian Yongming, Hu Lin, Wu Yuchu, and Wang Xiaolai from Shanghai all registered on the 19th. In addition, there are Huang Yanpei, Zheng Kuiyi, Zhou Qianchong, Jiang Hengyuan, Duanmu Kai, Fu Sinian, Wu Yifang, Hu Jianzhong, Ma Chengfeng, and Lu Guangsheng, etc.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guilin, 19th] Gui Province Council Member Lei Peihong and others flew to Beijing today to attend the Political Council meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yang Yuzi, Wan Renqian, Feng Jinbai and other council members of the Democratic Socialist Party took a car to Beijing last night to prepare to participate in the conference of the government. Zhang Junmai has registered with the assembly in his own handwriting, but he stayed in Shanghai due to business and could not go within a day or two. Reliable sources say that the Democratic Socialist Party has decided to propose a proposal in this Political Council meeting to request the government to take the initiative to resume peace talks. The reason is that the civil war has lasted for a long time and the people are struggling to survive. At this time, they hope that the government will be generous and not care about the reaction of the Chinese Communist Party, and first propose to resume peace talks. In this way, the restoration of peace may have a glimmer of hope.</p>
<h3>Seeking Peace Politically, Seeking Stability Economically: Qian Yongming and Others Talk About Current Urgent Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Council Member Qian Yongming recently told reporters about the peace issue, believing that after eight years of war, China is like a long-term sick person, and the restoration of peace is a matter of urgency. From the common people to the government, everyone has the same feeling and the same reason, and deeply hopes to see peace again as soon as possible. He hopes that the Communist Party can be open and honest and engage in negotiations. When the reporter asked what would happen if the Communist Party insisted on the previous two conditions, Qian said that if the Communist Party does not recognize the constitution, the situation will be difficult. On the other hand, the government's credibility must also be taken into account. Qian's view on the current economic problem is that the current economic crisis is caused by psychological panic. Therefore, the most important thing at present is how to make everything "stable." Qian believes that if we want to bring legal currency back into circulation, issuing public bonds is indeed a way, but the main thing is still how to increase production, and the prerequisite for increasing production is "stability." Therefore, seeking peace politically and seeking stability economically are the most urgent tasks.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Council Member Wang Xiaolai met with our reporter on the 19th and talked about the current peace and economic issues. He deeply hoped that the government and the public could act in good conscience and work hard for the future of the country. Wang solemnly pointed out that they had made peace appeals as early as last year, but unfortunately they did not attract widespread attention at that time. Today, peace is still a matter of urgency, and efforts should be made to promote its early realization. The most important condition for realizing peace is that "everyone can bring out their conscience." Regarding the current economic problem, Wang believes that the problem is that the disease is serious and the medicine is weak. From the government's point of view, the most important thing is to maintain its credibility. The story of losing faith in the people in the past should not be seen today. Foreign exchange must be controlled back and forth, and the list of foreign exchange applicants should be made public to avoid manipulation by a few people.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Huang Yanpei, a council member of the China Democratic League, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 19th and went to the Political Council to register. When the reporter asked him about his views on national affairs, Huang said: "I am here in Beijing this time to exchange opinions with all parties on the issue of peace, because peace is what everyone hopes for. As for the results, it depends on various factors. I intend to propose a plan to call for peace, but now I am looking at the opinions of all the council members and studying ways to seek peace, and it will depend on the government's attitude." In addition, Council Member Xu Deheng spent the whole day of the 19th in contact with various parties, studying ways to call for peace. When there is any achievement, he will submit a specific plan to the Political Council.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said when he met with reporters yesterday: "The China Democratic League has decided to propose a truce and resumption of peace talks at the Political Council, but the detailed methods are still to be studied and decided." Since 1940, the China Democratic League has advocated that the only way to resolve our domestic disputes is to adopt the path of "nationalization of the army and democratization of politics." When the Anti-Japanese War was won, it also advocated convening a party meeting to seek the unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and to coordinate and supervise by various parties. The above two proposals have remained consistent to this day.</p>
<h3>Unified Interpretation of the Constitution</h3>
<p>Constitutional Government Research Committee Passed</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] The Research Committee of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association held its second meeting at 9:00 am on the 19th, chaired by Liu Zhendong, and passed: (1) Regarding the Wen Yang Constitution Unified Explanation Case; (2) The government should inform the association in writing at any time about the handling of various elections (such as the election peak survey), the establishment of election agencies at all levels, and the progress of implementation, so as to facilitate research and resolution of the case; (3) Please have the government appoint fair local people to fill the positions in the election offices in various places; (4) Local governments should not apportion the election expenses to the people.</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Commemorates the Premier; Li Jingqi Reports on Land Administration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 19th] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a weekly memorial service for the Premier on the morning of the 19th, chaired by Sun Ke. Minister of Land Administration Li Jingqi reported on land administration work, making a brief explanation on the two aspects of land registration and land policy. He believes that China's land registration is very chaotic. The land that has been cleared throughout the country is only 27 percent, and the land reports are not perfect. In the future, it is planned to divide the country into several surveying areas according to longitude and latitude, and then send personnel to each area for clearance, and at the same time adopt aerial surveying methods in order to complete the land registration work as soon as possible. As for China's land policy, it should be owned, governed, and shared by the people to achieve the governance of Datong.</p>
<h3>President Zhang Counsels Students: Freedom and the Rule of Law Should Complement Each Other; Seeking Peace Should Not Be One-Sided Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 19th] The National Government announced measures to maintain social order on the 18th. In order to ensure its faithful and effective implementation, President Zhang of the Executive Yuan issued the following statement:</p>
<p>The reorganization of the government is mainly aimed at ending the period of political tutelage and preparing for the implementation of constitutional government. In order to ensure the smooth completion of this task and to guarantee the effective implementation of constitutional government, not only should the legal preparations for the implementation of constitutional government be completed at this time, but also the spiritual preparations should be completed, and constitutional spirit should be cultivated as much as possible to create a social atmosphere that respects the law and discipline. On the government's side, all guarantees of the people's freedom and other legitimate rights and interests that can be implemented earlier will be implemented as early as possible and as thoroughly as possible. At the same time, it also requires the people of the whole country to improve their sense of law and their sense of responsibility to the country, so that freedom and the rule of law can complement each other and jointly complete the spiritual preparations for the implementation of constitutional government. Therefore, the success or failure of future constitutional government cannot rely solely on the unilateral efforts of the government. The people also bear the greatest responsibility.</p>
<h3>Obey the Law Before the Implementation of Constitutional Government; Even More So After the Implementation of Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>The actions of students in various places recently have exceeded the scope permitted by national morality and national law. In particular, a small number of bad elements have wantonly slandered and insulted the government and officials. These kinds of outrageous behaviors cannot be tolerated not only in today's time when the government urgently needs stability, but also after the implementation of constitutional government. The measures to maintain social order announced by the government yesterday were taken to maintain social order and avoid emergencies. Article 23 of the Constitution has clear provisions on this. This will also be the case after the implementation of constitutional government, and it cannot be regarded as an expedient measure today. The government must faithfully implement this measure, and the people must also strictly abide by it.</p>
<p>The country has suffered significant losses in life, property, materials, and resources during the long-term war of resistance, and the losses in morality and culture are especially incalculable. These kinds of non-material losses should be compensated for through education. I participated in education work in my early years, and I still maintain many relationships with education undertakings in recent years. I have a deep understanding and sympathy for the psychology and demands of young people. Since taking over the Executive Yuan, I have been extremely concerned about the difficulties in education. At the beginning of my tenure, I gathered the presidents, deans, and professors of various colleges and universities in Nanjing for a tea party to ask about the difficulties they encountered and to listen to various opinions for reference in governance. All kinds of practical problems related to improving education and improving student life that can be solved will be solved as much as possible, and those that are difficult to solve immediately are being carefully studied.</p>
<h3>The Government Will Never Ignore Students' Legitimate Demands</h3>
<p>If students have legitimate demands, they can submit them to the government through the school authorities in accordance with legal and reasonable procedures, and the government will never ignore them. Now, students in various schools are taking direct action, and even including school administrative issues such as professor salaries and education funding in the requirements they have put forward, and even obstructing traffic, coercing the government, damaging public property, and hindering official duties. These kinds of outrageous behaviors have no precedent in any advanced democratic country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, apart from individual issues, the slogans against the war that have been touted in this student movement are based on the government's consistent policy of resolving domestic disputes through political means. Since Chairman Chiang invited the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to discuss peace plans in August of last year, I have always participated. The government has been very tolerant and has tried its best to seek peace, but the Chinese Communist Party has never had the sincerity to resolve the issue, and finally openly closed the door to peace talks. However, even under this situation, the government has not abandoned its original intention. As long as the Chinese Communist Party is willing to make peace, the government is still willing to engage in political means to resolve the issue. This purpose is clearly expressed in the new government's policy guidelines, and the people of the country have witnessed it. Students should know that instead of exploring the crux of the peace issue now, they are making a fuss against the government and making one-sided and unreasonable demands.</p>
<h3>What is the "Eating-Up Movement"? Where is the Personality?</h3>
<p>This is obviously being instigated and used. What is the "Eating-Up Movement" placing the personality of young people? What will be the impression in the minds of ordinary people?</p>
<p>In short, the government's original intention to cherish young people and attach importance to education will not change because of this student unrest, but the responsibility to faithfully implement orders to maintain order and stability cannot be shirked. It is hoped that the teachers and principals of various schools will do their best to persuade and influence them, and those who are fathers and brothers should take more responsibility for restraining and disciplining them, so that the studies and peaceful lives of the majority of students can be guaranteed under rational guidance and not be threatened by a few. As for how to overcome the existing difficulties in education, I am still willing to cooperate with the teachers and staff of various schools and the education administrative authorities at any time to discuss and study, in order to seek solutions through multi-faceted cooperation and efforts. Finally, I sincerely appeal to the young people of all schools to promote reason, restrain emotions, and concentrate their pure strength to stabilize their own schools and enrich their own knowledge and abilities, so as to build the country and seek a bright way out of difficulties.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Mongolian and Tibetan People Send Congratulatory Telegrams</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 19th] It is reported that the newly appointed Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Xu Shiying, set off from Hong Kong on the 17th by the Jardine Matheson steamer to Shanghai and then to Nanjing. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th. Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun sent a special commissioner to welcome him. In addition, since the Executive Yuan announced Xu's appointment as Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, all parties have hoped that Xu will be highly respected and relied upon. The Panchen Lama Conference Hall Luo Jianzan and Mongol League representatives Minzhu Cewang, Duoji Liyaya, Qijunfeng and other banner people and relevant provincial governments all sent telegrams to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to congratulate him.</p>
<h3>The President Summons Fu Zuoyi and Others at the Central Training Corps</h3>

<h3>Mingshui and Zhangqiu Were Recovered Yesterday Afternoon</h3>

<h3>Banditry in Western Zhejiang's Mingshan and Other Areas Has Generally Become Peaceful</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 19th] Since the Zhejiang Security Headquarters launched the appeasement work, it has achieved considerable results. The entire territory of Zhejiang Province, except for the border areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangsu, where there are still remnants of bandits lurking, such as the Siming, Kuocang, and Wencheng mountainous areas, has generally become peaceful. According to the spokesperson of the headquarters, the headquarters captured 1,061 bandits, 207 suspects, killed 221 bandits, wounded 47 bandits, and 3,700 bandits repented in 1946. It also seized 764 long and short guns, 1 Thompson submachine gun, 3 portable machine guns, 2,150 rounds of ammunition, 77 hand grenades, 1 grenade launcher, and 2 grenades.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Northern Jiangsu is Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>The Remnants of the Communist Party in Yancheng and Funing Fled to the Binhai Area</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 19th] Since the redeployment of the National Army and the strengthening of self-defense forces by local governments in northern Jiangsu, the situation has gradually stabilized. It is reported that most of the remnants of the Communist Party who had been harassing Yancheng and Funing have fled to the Binhai area. The remnants of the Communist Party near Dongtai and Caoyan were repelled by the National Army at the beginning of the week. Dazhongji has also been re-entered into the control of the National Army. Yesterday, the remnants of the Communist Party still appeared from time to time on both sides of the Haitong section of the Tongyu Highway.</p>
<h3>The Government is Determined to Maintain Order; Martial Law Can be Declared at Any Time; Interview with Zhang Zhen, Acting Commander of the Beijing Garrison</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 19th] Since the government promulgated temporary measures to maintain social order, the reporter made a special visit to Zhang Zhen, Acting Commander of the Capital Garrison Command. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<p>Question: Since the government promulgated temporary measures to maintain social order, in your observation, is it possible that student parades and petitions will continue to occur?</p>
<p>Answer: It is possible, but they should abide by the measures promulgated by the government, and no outrageous or lawless actions will be allowed.</p>
<p>Question: The temporary measures to maintain social order stipulate that petitions should not exceed ten people. If the number of petitioners exceeds the stipulated number, what will happen?</p>
<p>Answer: It will not be allowed by law.</p>
<p>Question: The measures have provisions for taking emergency measures. Can you tell us the principles of emergency measures?</p>
<p>Answer: This Command has detailed plans for the preparations for emergency measures. In short, this Command is responsible for maintaining social security, and it is its unshirkable responsibility to enforce the laws and regulations, and it has the greatest determination to not allow any further actions that disrupt order. I hope that the public will provide more guidance so that students and people's groups can follow the President's earnest advice and give full play to the spirit of automatically obeying the law and respecting discipline.</p>
<p>Question: If there is a situation where these measures are not followed, will you consider declaring martial law?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, we have received orders and can declare it at any time.</p>
<h3>Council Members Exchange Opinions; Hold a Pre-Meeting Tea Party; Secretary Shao Says the Assembly Strives for Economy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] The Political Council held a pre-meeting tea party at 3:00 pm on the 19th, chaired by Jiang Yong. More than 200 council members attended. First, Secretary Shao Lizi reported: (1) This assembly was originally scheduled to be held on November 12 of last year, but later the government decided to convene the National Assembly on that day, and the two meetings could not be held at the same time. After the National Assembly, it was repeatedly delayed due to the reorganization of the government until now; (2) Due to the replacement of more than 10 people and the addition of 72 people, the number of council members in this assembly is more than in previous assemblies; (3) The preparations made by the secretariat are in accordance with established practice and comply with the principle of economy. Although it is now after the war, prices have risen even more than during the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, we still prepare economically. If there are any omissions in the reception and accommodation, please notify the secretariat. Then, Deputy Secretary Lei Zhen reported on the agenda of the assembly and the procedures for the opening ceremony. After that, the council members successively expressed their opinions:</p>
<p>Check How Past Proposals Have Been Handled</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the council members' proposals, Wang Yaming proposed that there should not be too many proposals, but it should be checked how the government has handled past proposals. Wu Wangji said that the resident committee or the secretariat should be responsible for checking, and he believes that checking is more important than proposing. Xu Deheng believes that this proposal should focus on the issue of peace and study how to stop the war. Xu believes that as long as the war is stopped, all economic and political issues can be resolved. (2) Regarding the government's policy report, Wu Zhaoxu proposed that the National Resources Commission should have a report, because the factories are all under the National Resources Commission, and the Ministry of Water Resources should also be included in the report. Someone also proposed that the government's report should adopt a symposium approach, because the council members are not executive members. Wu Wangji said that the symposium should be more important than the report.</p>
<p>The Government's Replies to Inquiries Should Be Submitted to the Review First</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the government's replies to inquiries, Wang Yaming believes that the government's replies to inquiries in the past were too negligent and very casual. Huang Yuren believes that the government's replies should have the demeanor of a statesman and be responsible. Someone else proposed that the government's replies should be submitted to the review committee for review. (4) Regarding the issue of the presidium, it was proposed that many of the members of the presidium have become officials and should be re-elected. Zhang Bangzhen was the first to respond.</p>
<p>Many Officials in the Presidium; Someone Proposed a Re-Election</p>
<p>Then, one after another, they spoke up, all believing that officials should withdraw from the presidium and that the presidium should be re-elected. Secretary Shao Lizi said that according to the organization regulations, the presidium is not limited to council members, so there is no need to re-elect, but council members who serve as officials should be immediately disqualified. However, the secretariat and the council have no right to deal with the re-election of the presidium. (5) Regarding expanding the powers of the council, Wang Puhan believes that before the implementation of constitutional government, the only agency that can express public opinion is the council. The so-called Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, but it is responsible to the elected Legislative Yuan. At present, the Legislative Yuan is still composed of officials, so it is the responsibility of officials to officials, and there is no democracy to speak of. If it is said that it is democracy, the Executive Yuan must be responsible to the council, the only highest agency of public opinion. If this council does not expand its powers, it is meaningless to hold meetings. Zhu Huiqing followed up in response, believing that it is necessary to expand its powers. (6) Da Pusheng proposed that the issues that should be discussed in this meeting include: (A) resolving the Chinese Communist Party issue as soon as possible; (B) implementing the Sino-Soviet Treaty as soon as possible and taking over Lushun and Dalian as soon as possible; (C) the United States and the Soviet Union should develop their relations in parallel; (D) prices are like wild horses that have broken free, and we should immediately find ways to solve them for the welfare of the people. Xu Deheng also proposed that agriculture and forestry are bankrupt, factories are closed, prices are soaring, and people have no way to make a living, etc.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's Political Report Emphasizes the Issue of the Chinese Communist Party</p>

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] Communist prisoners captured in Changchun claim that the Communist army's all-out offensive in the Northeast this time is a desperate plan to first seize Huaide, Gongzhuling, and Dehui, and finally Changchun and Jilin.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] After the fall of Huaide, Chen Mingren personally went to the front line to command the National Army's counterattack.

<h3>The Chairman's Speech Has Had a Good Effect; Five Universities May Stop Marches and Petitions; Zhongda Students Petition the President, Requesting an Immediate Resumption of Classes</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] President Chiang's speech to rectify the academic atmosphere and maintain law and order has had a positive impact on the surging student movement in Nanjing. The strike, march, and petition movements of the five universities in the capital showed signs of turning around on the 19th, and may return to normal. Wu Youxun, President of Zhongda University, and more than 20 professors convened a meeting with all students of the university on the evening of the 19th, attended by over 3,000 people. Wu and others delivered impassioned speeches on the spot, which moved the students. Wu also issued a lengthy letter to the students, urging them to resume classes. Therefore, Zhongda is scheduled to resume classes on the 20th, and the joint march and petition movement of the five universities, scheduled for the 20th, may only be attended by a few students. If the professors' persuasion is effective, the march and petition may be stopped altogether.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Representatives of the student unions of Zhongda, Jinda, and other universities, as well as representatives of the eight universities in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area who came to Nanjing to petition, held a joint meeting at 9:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th. They resolved to hold a march on the morning of the 20th and petition the Senate and the Executive Yuan. It was also decided not to mention the issue of a ceasefire in the joint declaration.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Over 1,000 students of Zhongda University submitted a letter to President Wu, requesting an immediate resumption of classes and opposing the entanglement of the university in political whirlpools. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To President Wu: Since the strike began a week ago, public sentiment has been boiling, and society has been critical. It is generally believed that Zhongda is leading the marches, and its stance has always been based on the nation and the people. The good order has been praised by people in society. However, this strike is very different. Not only has Zhongda's reputation plummeted, but the pure meaning of the movement has also been completely lost. Since last Friday, all resolutions of the various department and college representative meetings have tended to expand this movement. Representatives have gone out to contact various places, and the demand for public funds has changed to opposition to the civil war. The strong political overtones are unprecedented. This not only deeply entangles Zhongda in a political whirlpool but also makes it impossible for Zhongda to seek progress in stability. We believe that students should strive to explore the truth and increase their knowledge to contribute to humankind and the nation. Furthermore, a university that cultivates talents should not be turned into a venue for political parties to compete or a source of disturbing social tranquility. The last parade not only smashed the windows of the Ministry of Education but also insulted foreign reporters. There has been a lot of criticism of roadside propaganda. Moreover, the department and college representative meetings approved that all expenses during the movement should be paid from the students' welfare fund. Just look at the number of days of hospitality for representatives from other schools, the paper and printing of announcements, the rental of loudspeakers, the travel expenses of liaison representatives, and all expenses during the parade. It is not difficult to imagine the number of expenses. The 125 parade cost millions, and the 222 parade cost 3 million. If prices are multiplied by ten, this time it will cost 20,000 to 30,000. How much can the increased public funds benefit? Using the spear of the child to attack the shield of the child, the sinister intentions of these people are no longer concerned with the future of the school or the welfare of the students. Since they do not protect the school, why should the school spare them? Since the restoration of the school, it has undergone several setbacks before achieving today's progress. Furthermore, it has been heard that our teacher has vigorously fought for funding issues in the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan, and there have been some results, but the strike has stopped it. We are saddened by the school's reputation and earnestly request our teacher to display a spirit of great benevolence and courage and immediately resume classes to bring the school into a state of stability. Then the students will be fortunate, and the future of the school will be fortunate.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Wang Shuyu, a representative of the fourth grade of the Department of Political Science at Zhongda, He Anmin, a representative of the Department of Sociology, and Huang Zhong, a representative of the fourth grade of the Department of Economics, issued a letter to all students of the university on the 19th, expressing their grief and exposing the change in the nature of this movement, analyzing the causes of this student unrest, and the truth about someone manipulating the representatives of the various departments. Finally, they also expressed several wishes to the government. The book is titled "For Ourselves, for Zhongda, for the Nation, We Weep." Students from all over the school have responded enthusiastically. As of 9:00 PM, more than 2,000 people have signed their names.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] More than 30 principals of public and private secondary schools in Nanjing, including Wang Huishan, issued a "Letter to the Public" and a "Letter to the Parents of Students" regarding the recent student unrest in various places, requesting joint efforts to guide young people onto the right track and guide society towards stability.</p>
<h3>The Strike Wave Spreads in Universities in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin Dispatch, 19th] The student unions of Nankai University and Beiyang University in Tianjin held temporary meetings on the evening of the 17th. Nankai decided to strike for three days starting on the 18th, and Beiyang decided to strike for three days starting on the 19th, in response to the "anti-civil war and anti-hunger" movement in Beiping, Tsinghua, and Peking University. The reporter visited Nankai and Beiyang universities. No wall posters or slogans were found in Beiyang, while there were several wall posters with personal signatures "anti-hunger" on the Nankai wall poster area. Chen, Dean of Studies at Nanda, said that if students strike for political reasons, it is beyond the scope of education. If they strike to adjust their treatment, the topic is not too big. The result of the Nanda Student Union meeting was to organize an "Anti-Civil War and Anti-Hunger Action Committee" to coordinate actions with schools in Pingjin and across the country, and to demand: (1) Restore education funding to 15% of the national budget. (2) Reasonably increase the salaries of public education personnel. (3) Adjust public funding and increase the number of public funding places. (4) Increase the non-staple food allowance to 110,000 yuan and adjust it monthly according to the price index. (5) The first-term class should have public funding. (6) Before the end of the civil war in China, please ask the United States to stop its 500 million loan to China. (7) Reduce agricultural taxes. (8) Postpone military service. (9) Exempt the conscription of military grain, and decided to accept the suggestions of the 11 department-level associations, 21 bulletin boards, and social groups of Tsinghua and Peking University, and set June 2 as "Anti-Civil War Day", linking the nationwide strike, stop teaching, strike, stop market, and organize the Pingjin Student Union. The meeting did not end until midnight. The situation in Beiyang was roughly the same.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After Beiyang and Nankai in Tianjin decided to strike, other universities and secondary schools have begun to suffer. On the 18th, they were all preparing to hold meetings and brewing a response. Students from Beiyang University decided to go out of the school this week to give street speeches. The Student Union of the school had a telegram on the 18th, addressed to the Senate. The content was purely to oppose the civil war, and there was no demand for adjusting treatment. There were three specific conditions: (1) Invite the CCP to attend the Senate. (2) Postpone the meeting until the CCP attends. (3) Abandon partisan opinions and jointly seek peace.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 19th] The student unrest in Tianjin is spreading even further. On the 19th, Hebei Institute of Technology, National Physical Education College, and Aquatic Products College followed suit and went on strike. Although the authorities of the schools tried their best to prevent the planned parade on the 20th, it is still difficult to hope that it will be stopped. The municipal government convened a meeting of responsible persons from various universities and colleges on the 19th to discuss appropriate measures. The municipal authorities stated that they were determined to sincerely love and guide the youth so as not to be used by traitors.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Universities and colleges above the junior college level in Beiping have responded to the anti-civil war movement. The schools on strike include Yenching, Chaoyang, Sino-French, and the National First Midwifery Teachers College. However, the main reason for the teachers college strike is the "Fuda Movement."</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] A group of students at the National College of Social Education decided to go on strike from the 19th to respond to the Zhongda University student movement, and sent representatives to Nanjing to petition and other actions. Now, another group of students at the college believes that the above actions are too radical, so they have formed a separate faction, organized a Social Education Students' Request for Reasonable Increase in Tuition Fees Conference, using telegram declarations as the main advocacy tool, and opposed the strike action. The school authorities also believe that the strike wastes academic studies, and are currently persuading students to resume classes.</p>
<h3>Conflict Incident at Xidan Archway in Beiping; Chief of Staff of the Youth Army Talks About the Facts of What Happened</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch, 18th] A group of students gave street speeches in Xidan in the afternoon of the 18th and had a conflict with soldiers of the 208th Division of the Youth Army from an argument to a mutual fight. After this unfortunate incident occurred, the reporter visited officers of the 208th Division to ask for their opinions on this incident. According to Chief of Staff Sun of the division, "Our division is an organization that trains unemployed and out-of-school youth. The soldiers of our division are all young students who have received secondary education or above, and their nature is different from that of ordinary army soldiers. Today happened to be Sunday, and the soldiers were on leave and entered the city. They encountered the lecturing students in Xidan. The students stopped the car our division soldiers were riding in, wrote slogans, and gave many satirical speeches. The soldiers saw the slogans written by the students in the city and on our division's cars, which contained a lot of inflammatory and stimulating meanings. They heard the students' speeches, which contained words that insulted the head of state and disrupted social order. The soldiers themselves are also young students, and their feelings of loving the country and respecting the head of state are particularly strong. Their opinions differed from those of the lecturing students, which led to arguments and then mutual fighting. Both the students and the soldiers of our division were injured. Two soldiers of our division encountered a large number of students in Houjie, Jingshan, and were surrounded and beaten, suffering serious injuries. They are now being sent to the hospital for treatment. We deeply regret this unfortunate incident. In addition to ordering an investigation to identify the soldiers who caused the incident and punish them, we also hope that the relevant school authorities will sincerely guide the students, taking the country as the standard, and considering social order and students' studies as important, and not make too many stimulating remarks and slogans to avoid expanding the situation and affecting social order." Chief of Staff Sun finally analyzed to the reporter the reasons for the argument conflict between the Youth Army soldiers and the students, saying: "The soldiers of our division are students who have received considerable training, and their understanding of the current situation is also more profound. Previously, when the soldiers of our division were conducting exercises in Weishi Shanzhuang, they were attacked by the Communist army, resulting in many deaths and injuries. They also saw many slogans in that area, which were roughly the same as those seen on the streets today. In addition, soldiers of our city were insulted by students in the Summer Palace, who said that our division soldiers were Kuomintang cattle. Today, in Xidan, some students insulted the soldiers with the same words, such as 'The Youth Army is a Kuomintang running dog!' 'You should put down your guns!' and so on. The soldiers were stimulated and argued with the students, which led to arguments and ultimately to mutual fighting. As for the nature of this unfortunate incident, it should be regarded as an accidental event caused by differences of opinion between students and cannot be regarded as a conflict between students and the army. We hope that a reasonable solution can be obtained as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] The Support Association formed by students from Peking University and other schools hosted reporters at 2:00 PM today to explain the incident, saying that they had protested to the Xingyuan regarding the conflict between students and the military yesterday. It was also said that there were a total of eight people injured and hospitalized, and the three seriously injured were no longer in life-threatening danger. The classmates donated money to express their condolences, but they did not accept it and transferred it to the Support Association. The rumors of missing students yesterday have not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Support Association, composed of Peking University, Tsinghua, Yenching, Sino-French, Chaoyang, Beiyang, Pingbu Teachers College, Tieyuan, and Nankai, Beiyang, Tangshan, and Teachers College in Tianjin, has decided to hold a parade in the three places at the same time tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Orders Famous General Porcelain to Be Presented to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Other Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] President Chiang has recently ordered many exquisite porcelain pieces from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, to be presented to the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. The Jiangxi Provincial Ceramics Vocational School and the Rao Huafeng Porcelain Company are jointly handling the matter. Half of the pieces are scheduled to be delivered in June and September.

<h3>Siam Levies Huge Entry Taxes on Overseas Chinese Transiting Through the Country.</h3>
<p>More than 70 people were unable to pay and were detained.</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 19th] Many of the overseas Chinese who returned to Burma after the war passed through Siam. The local government harassed overseas Chinese transiting through the country quite a bit. According to a telegram from Bangkok, the Siamese government recently suddenly increased the entry tax for overseas Chinese to 1,500 baht per person, worth more than 20 million National Currency. More than 70 of our overseas Chinese have been detained because they were unable to pay. It is hoped that our overseas Chinese will not transit through Siam again when returning to Burma.</p>
<h3>Hu Shih Talks About the Student Unrest; Hopes that Students Will Not Use Strikes as a Means</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Hu Shih, reversing his past silence, made some remarks today on President Chiang's address to students and the provisional measures decided by the State Council, as well as the student strike. He said: The announcement of President Chiang's address and provisional measures, at 8:00 AM on the 18th, was not aimed at the Peking University incident. Hu Shih pointed out that students were making trouble because they were emotional, and also explained that the government's address said that the students' actions were directly or indirectly instigated by the Communist Party. He said: Students are young people, and they do feel depressed in this difficult environment. He also said: Emergency measures are temporary measures to maintain order, aimed at petitions. At the meeting with Li Zongren of the Xingyuan and various universities and colleges yesterday, I reiterated what I have been saying for the past 20 years, that young people's interest in politics is a natural phenomenon and a common rule throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. The responsibility for advocating political reform often falls on young people. Speaking of student strikes, Hu Shih pointed out that it is not a solution. Studying politics, expressing opinions, and even going outside the school to engage in political activities, whether aboveground or underground, are all permissible. However, the current political problems are too complicated, and the Political Consultative Conference has not achieved results for more than ten months, let alone student strikes. I sympathize with young people's demands for improving the current situation, but I hope they will not sacrifice their studies or interfere in politics. The ability of workers' strikes to achieve results is limited to fighting for salary or working hours, and it is difficult to achieve results by interfering in politics. Reforming political and social systems, without using revolutionary means, must go through legal public opinion institutions to promote their realization. I sincerely hope that students will not use strikes as a means.</p>
<h3>The Philippine Government Announces That It Refuses Overseas Chinese Repatriation; Sino-Philippine Commercial and Navigation Treaty Negotiations May Begin This Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters Manila Dispatch, 19th] The Philippine government recently announced that it opposes the return of 7,600 overseas Chinese to the Philippines. Most of them were sent back to China last year and in 1945 by UNRRA as displaced persons. They were originally overseas Chinese in the Philippines before the war, and UNRRA has already certified that there are no mistakes. The content of the Philippine government's reply to UNRRA has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Manila Dispatch, 19th] Philippine Foreign Ministry officials stated today that negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Commercial and Navigation Treaty will begin this week, as the Philippine Senate passed the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty last week, clearing the obstacles. Philippine officials said: Overseas Chinese are more concerned about the terms of the new treaty than their compatriots in their home country. This treaty will stipulate trade methods, sea and air navigation rights, tariffs, and other donations, as well as the scope of overseas Chinese trade in the Philippines.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Revises the Income Tax Law and Promulgates Regulations on Tax-Exempt Amounts and Tax Brackets</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] In view of the soaring prices, the Ministry of Finance believes that the tax-exempt amounts and tax rates originally set in the Income Tax Law promulgated last year are no longer suitable for the current situation. In order to cope with the economic situation and adapt to price fluctuations, the Regulations on Adjusting Tax-Exempt Amounts and Tax Brackets of the Income Tax Law have been formulated, and adjustments have been made based on various price indices and the cost of living allowance index for civil servants. The tax-exempt amounts and tax brackets stipulated in the original tax law have been reduced to reduce the burden on taxpayers. It is learned that the tax-exempt amounts and tax rates for the first category of profit-seeking enterprise income tax, the second category of income from business or artistic performance, the fourth category of property rental income tax, the fifth category of temporary income tax, and the comprehensive income tax for the 36th year, as well as the tax-exempt amounts and tax rates for the second category of salary and remuneration income tax in various regions from June 1 to December 1, 35, have been separately adjusted and announced. In the future, the tax-exempt amounts will be generally increased and the tax rates will be reduced accordingly. Taking the first category of profit-seeking enterprise income tax as an example, the original tax-exempt amount was set at less than 5% of the total amount of capital for the annual income. Now it has been changed to less than 12%. As for the higher tax rate, the original regulation stipulated that those with an income equal to or greater than 50% of the total amount of capital would be taxed at 30%. The new standard has been changed to only those with an income equal to or greater than 115% of the total amount of capital will be taxed at 30%.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of National Defense Issues a Circular to All Troops to Effectively Maintain Freedom of the Press; Corrections Can Be Sought for Inaccurate Records</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] In view of the fact that incidents of destroying news and publishing organizations have occurred from time to time in various places, and even illegal acts of malicious sabotage have occurred, the Ministry of National Defense believes that this is contrary to the government's original intention of guaranteeing freedom of the press. In order to effectively maintain and prevent future troubles, a circular has been issued to all troops across the country. If there are rumors or inaccuracies in newspapers or speeches that involve the military's reputation, the responsible authorities may weigh the severity of the situation and report it for correction, or resort to legal means and await a ruling, in order to comply with the government's policy intentions. 74 rifles were found in the search of the school.</p>

Earlier this month, Liu Hongsheng, Executive Director of the Executive Yuan, along with Wang Renlin, Director of the Fisheries Administration, and several Chinese and foreign fishery experts, returned from an inspection and have decided to build the foundation of the fishing industry on Zhoushan Island.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan will establish three factories in the Zhoushan Archipelago: a canned food factory, a fish oil refinery, and a fish processing factory. Detailed plans are being submitted to the UNRRA authorities for approval. Zhoushan Island is the largest island in the Zhoushan Archipelago and will become a base for the Executive Yuan to build fishing boats. The Executive Yuan plans to use UNRRA lumber to build 500 small and medium-sized new wooden boats and repair 450 old wooden boats from the private sector, for a total of 950 boats. According to Wang Yikang, Deputy Director of the Fisheries Administration, the town of Shenjiamen on Zhoushan Island is likely to be the center for building wooden boats.</p>
<p>In addition to the Zhoushan Archipelago, the Executive Yuan is planning to establish similar fish processing industries along the coasts of South and North China. Taiwan, Guangdong, Xiamen, Tianjin, and Shandong are all potential locations. Fish processing expert Nelson is leaving Shanghai today for Taiwan to select a suitable location for fish processing.</p>

<h3>The Political Consultative Council Opens Again! – How Can Councilors Fulfill Their Duties?</h3>
<p>The Third Session of the Fourth National Political Consultative Council opened in Nanjing this morning at 9:00 AM. In today's turbulent and uneasy nation, we cannot help but have some expectations for the convening of this National Political Consultative Council.</p>
<p>The National Political Consultative Council was originally established during the War of Resistance. It was first established in Wuhan in July 1938. Although there was not enough time to use democratic elections due to the urgency of the war, the selection of its councilors included representatives from all provinces, cities, border regions, overseas Chinese, and all non-governmental organizations, including leaders from all parties and factions and national social elites. Therefore, the Political Consultative Council itself symbolized national unity. During the eight-year War of Resistance, it represented the people, supervised the government's implementation of national policies for the war, and made immeasurable contributions to winning the war. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the National Assembly has been held, and the new constitution will soon be implemented, the nation is not far from entering a truly constitutional era, and the significance of the Political Consultative Council's existence is bound to be greatly reduced. However, with the domestic situation developing to its current state, the door to peace talks has long been closed by the Chinese Communist Party, the political stalemate has not yet been resolved, and the constitutional National Assembly is still awaiting elections. During this transitional period, there is still an urgent need for an organization that symbolizes national unity to build a strong foundation for democratic unification and to break the current political deadlock. Therefore, the convening of this Political Consultative Council should be extraordinary. We should indeed pay attention to how the councilors fulfill their duties.</p>
<p>First, almost everyone in the country longs for peace and stability, and some councilors intend to propose motions expressing their hope for the resumption of peace talks. Our country has suffered greatly from this eight-year war. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the government wanted to let the people rest, and the people wanted to restore their vitality, so peace was what everyone yearned for. Today's issue is not whether or not to have peace, but rather to distinguish who wants to destroy peace and how to curb the spread of this evil force that destroys peace. After much painful reflection, we feel that the only way to save the current crisis is to use the power of the people to awaken the thorough awareness of the Chinese Communist Party so that they can put the country and the people first, immediately lay down their weapons, and leave a glimmer of hope for the people of the country. Although councilors Zhou Binglin, Qian Duansheng, and Xu Deheng have suggested that the government invite CCP councilors to attend, the CCP councilors have not accepted their good intentions, continue to be hostile to the government, and refuse to attend the Political Consultative Council. Our people cannot help but express disappointment. To be honest, the key to peace or war in the country today is entirely in the hands of the CCP: whether or not peace talks can be restored depends entirely on the CCP's will. If the Political Consultative Council wants to discuss the issue of restoring peace talks, we hope that all councilors from all over the country can face reality and first have the courage to go to the CCP's occupied areas and "seek skins from a tiger." Everyone must know that the National Government issued a clear ceasefire order long before the National Assembly convened last year. However, the CCP ignored it and even pointed out that the unilateral ceasefire was invalid. This clearly shows that it is the CCP, not the government, that wants to fight to the end. Councilors and others who shout "anti-civil war" will only make naive people happy if they only talk big in Beijing and Shanghai and do not go to the CCP areas to stop the fighting desperately. Experts will instead say that they are helping the CCP to slow down the military.</p>
<p>Second, what troubles the majority of the people in the country the most is the economic and financial crisis, which has not yet escaped its dangerous situation, and the people are suffering so much that they can barely survive. In the past month, the social unrest and the fluctuation of people's minds have been caused by some hidden instigating forces, but it is undeniable that the government has not been able to decisively deal with the situation and stabilize the financial economy. The Political Consultative Council is convened at this time, whether for the fate of the nation or for the suffering of the people, the councilors must be calm, realistic, and seek truth from facts, and jointly discuss a practical and concrete method so that the people in deep water and fire can breathe a sigh of relief. We do not want the councilors to simply chase shadows, criticize and scold, just to be happy; we sincerely hope that they will carefully plan in the cracks between the people's suffering and the government's difficulties, and save money for the government, and find a more feasible and practical way to save the economic crisis.</p>
<p>In short, although we dare not have endless extravagant hopes for the Political Consultative Council that opened today, we at least earnestly hope that the councilors will have great wisdom and courage. Standing on the people's side, think of a positive way to solve the economic crisis and supervise the government's implementation. This is great wisdom. With the determination of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" uniting the majority of the councilors, everyone runs to the CCP's occupied areas, and uses the voice of the people to urge them to lay down their weapons, thereby eliminating the root of the destruction of peace. This is great courage. If the councilors have this kind of great wisdom, courage, and spirit, then the convening of this Political Consultative Council can be expected to be fruitful. Otherwise, we cannot help but feel sorry for the country's large waste of public funds!</p>
<h3>Laws and Prestige</h3>
<p>The six articles of the temporary measures for maintaining social order were passed by the Executive Yuan Council a few days ago, and then the National Government issued an order, and the relevant legal provisions such as the criminal law were also announced as necessary. This order and these laws are a measure that the government has had to take to prevent public safety from being harmed and order from being disrupted. All good and law-abiding citizens will definitely respect these laws. Only by strictly implementing these laws can the government fulfill its duty of eradicating violence and maintaining peace.</p>
<p>However, the value of laws lies in the effectiveness of their "implementation." Mencius said it well: "Mere laws cannot enforce themselves." Therefore, with laws, there must be upright and selfless law enforcement officials. The reason why "justice" should be valued is here, and the reason why "justice" should maintain its dignity is also here. Only by valuing justice, so that the judicial organs can truly have their independent and detached dignity, can the government have prestige. Only when the government has prestige can the country be expected to move from chaos to order.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we recall the many social unrest events in recent times, the reason for their development is that, although there may be some conspiracies involved, the government's failure to respond properly and its self-defeating prestige are also irreplaceable losses. Some things could have been done later, but they were decided hastily and insisted on doing them; but when they were opposed, protested, boycotted, and petitioned, they changed to accept everything. Even things that are clearly illegal and disciplinary should be punished according to the law, but they are often threatened by the masses and do not hesitate to make concessions outside the law in order to calm things down. The intention may not be reprehensible, but the fact is that although things are calmed down, people are not at peace. Because this kind of way to calm things down does not seek it in the law, but seeks it outside the law, how can it prevent future illegal actions? For example, yesterday, there was a clear order prohibiting students from striking and marching, but thousands of students still went on strike and marched, and the military and police failed to dissuade them and still allowed the march to happen. Is this kind of law enforcement not a satire of the law? On the first day the law was promulgated, the authorities gave such a counter-evidence to the effectiveness of the law in fact, and we cannot help but feel deeply saddened for the government's prestige!</p>

<h3>The Yoshida Cabinet Resigns En Masse Today; Agreement Reached on Katayama Becoming Prime Minister; Speakers of the House of Representatives to be from the Conservative Parties</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Yoshida Cabinet will resign en masse tomorrow (20th). The procedure from the Cabinet's resignation to the formation of the new Cabinet is as follows: First, Yoshida will take the resignation to the palace to present to the Emperor. Then, the resignation will be reported to both houses of the Diet. After receiving the report, both houses will immediately elect a new Prime Minister. Then, the appointment ceremony for the new Prime Minister will be held in the palace. After the new Prime Minister is appointed, he will begin the work of forming a Cabinet. After the Cabinet is formed, he will go to the palace again to request the Emperor's approval, and then the appointment ceremony for the cabinet ministers will be held.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Today, Socialist Party Chairman Katayama individually visited Liberal Party President Yoshida and Democratic Party President Ashida, as well as National Cooperative Party Secretary-General Miki, to discuss the Prime Minister issue. Yoshida and Ashida both expressed their parties' support for Katayama's appointment as Prime Minister. At the same time, Yoshida stated that he would reserve his decision on whether to join the cabinet. Ashida also said: My attitude will be considered after Yoshida makes his decision. Therefore, another meeting of representatives from the four parties will be held again tomorrow to discuss and decide. It is rumored that Yoshida's reason for reserving his decision to join the cabinet is that the relationship between the left wing of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party has not been clearly severed. The Socialist Party originally planned to ask Yoshida to serve as Minister of Home Affairs or Minister of State in the Katayama Cabinet. National Cooperative Party Secretary-General Miki stated during Katayama's visit that he fully supported the Socialist Party's Prime Minister's Cabinet. After Katayama's individual visits to the parties today, in the first Diet meeting to be held tomorrow, the issue of Socialist Party Chairman Katayama's appointment as Prime Minister is absolutely certain.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The candidates for Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives are related to the Prime Minister issue because there is a provision that they are nominated by the Prime Minister. The heads of the parties have already reached an agreement on this. Under a Socialist Party Prime Minister, Yamazaki of the Liberal Party as Speaker and Inejiro Asanuma of the Socialist Party as Vice-Speaker are the most promising.</p>
<h3>Soviet Delegation to Arrive in Seoul Today or Tomorrow; U.S. Delegation Advisor Visits Hodge</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] The Soviet delegation attending the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission is still staying in Moscow and has not yet flown to Pyongyang due to bad weather. It is understood that they will have to fly from the Soviet Union to Pyongyang in one or two days and then transfer to Seoul.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 8th] The 75-member Soviet delegation did not arrive here as scheduled today. At the same time, the Korean people have canceled the planned anti-trusteeship demonstration. The reason for the Soviet delegation's delay is unknown. It is hoped that they will take the train from the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea on the 19th to meet with the U.S. representatives on the 20th to resume negotiations. Korean political leaders all said that the cancellation of the demonstration was in accordance with the police's advice. U.S. officials also said that participants in the demonstration would affect their qualifications to consult with the U.S. and Soviet representatives.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] James, an advisor to the U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, arrived in Seoul on the 17th.

<h3>U.S.-Soviet Commission Meeting Postponed</h3>

<h3>British Ready to Hand Over Middle East and Mediterranean Defense to the U.S.; Imperial Military Bases to be Withdrawn to East Africa</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] Well-informed British sources said today that Britain is preparing to hand over military responsibility for the Mediterranean and the Middle East to the United States and withdraw British Imperial defenses to East Africa. According to qualified military sources close to the British War Office, this move means that the defense of the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal will be the responsibility of the United States, but Britain will not abandon its economic and political interests in the Middle East as a result. British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons last Friday that Britain intends to continue to be concerned about the Middle East and the Mediterranean. The withdrawal of British military and supply bases to East Africa is scheduled to be completed in two or three years, changing the British Empire's defense plans for the past fifty years. The United States already has concrete interests in the Mediterranean and has sufficient strength, so it can take on this major responsibility. As for Britain's decision to strengthen defenses in areas such as Kenya and Rhodesia in East Africa, it is because Britain has decided to withdraw from India before June next year, the situation in Palestine is unstable, and the status of Sudan is uncertain. British officials admit that the draft of the African defense strategy must be actively cooperated with by the local residents, and must be coordinated with France and Belgium, which are Britain's most important and reliable neighbors in Africa. Colonial administrators from Britain, France, and Belgium will meet in Paris tomorrow to discuss a wide range of issues in Africa, such as transportation, public health, and food supply. The three countries will also establish a joint committee to implement the decisions made in Paris.</p>
<h3>U.S. Warship Visiting Persian Gulf Arrives in Bombay Yesterday; Soviet Ambassador to Iran Returns Home</h3>

<h3>Turkey Buys Ships from the U.S.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 18th] The Turkish Minister of Transportation revealed today that Turkey has purchased six cargo ships and one passenger ship with a speed of 17 knots per hour from the United States. The Turkish government is still negotiating with the U.S. and plans to continue purchasing eight passenger ships, six small ferries, and two cargo ships, totaling 70,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Japan Denies Military Building Request</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] The Japanese Foreign Ministry today denied reports by some news agencies that Japan plans to build a 100,000-strong army after the end of the occupation. According to a senior diplomatic official who told the agency that a Japanese official had inquired about the reaction of the government he represented to Japan's request to build an army, this army and a small air force were only intended to prevent smuggling, etc.</p>
<h3>Banque de l'Indochine Opens Tokyo Branch</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 19th] The Tokyo branch of the Banque de l'Indochine of Vietnam opened today, making it the second foreign bank to be allowed to open in Tokyo. The first was Citibank, which reopened here last summer. According to current regulations, Banque de l'Indochine can only handle deposit business for private individuals of the occupation forces. It is still not allowed to handle commercial and remittance business, and its business will not be restored until Japan and foreign countries resume trade relations. It is said that the branches of British and French banks in Japan will also reopen in the near future.</p>
<h3>Britain Approves Plan to Build Nuclear Power Plant</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] The Daily Express reported today that Britain's first nuclear power plant will be built in Trawsfynydd, Cumberland. The plant will be large in scale and will use uranium to generate electricity. It will be equipped with several uranium-powered engines. The Atomic Energy Commission has drafted a plan to start the first engine within five years, which has been approved by the cabinet. It is estimated that the construction of the plant will cost £7 million (US$28 million). The maximum power generation of its main engine will be 75,000 kilowatts, which is enough to supply the electricity and power needed for a city of the size of Liverpool. The city has a population of 855,000 and is the fourth largest city in Britain. Depending on the performance of the engine, other engines will be added to the site. The second nuclear power plant will be located somewhere in Scotland. The total power generation of the two plants should eventually reach more than 1 million kilowatts, supplying a quarter of Britain's electricity needs and saving 5 million tons of coal per year. The Daily Express is run by Beaverbrook, leans towards the Conservative Party, and has a daily circulation of 3.45 million copies, making it the largest in the world.</p>
<h3>U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Royal Discusses the World Situation</h3>
<p>Says the U.S. and Soviet Union Must Resolve Their Disputes</p>
<p>[United Press, Atlanta, Georgia, 18th] Under Secretary of the Army Royal said here recently that the world's two major political and military powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, must find ways to resolve their disputes and should not appease each other. In the current international situation, Italy and Japan have become defeated countries, Germany has also been conquered, and China is moving towards unification, developing its vast potential, but progress is slow and often interrupted. India is still far from realizing its strength. Small countries in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, South America, and Africa are still not worthy of attention from a military point of view. Although our country's relationship with Britain is close, Britain has lost its military strength since World War II and is no longer the master of the oceans. Its imperial system has also loosened and is not as strong as it was hundreds of years ago. Therefore, only the United States and the Soviet Union are the world's two major military and political powers, and this situation is unlikely to change in the next few decades. Therefore, armaments and diplomacy are now tied to the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Benton Stresses the Need to Maintain U.S. External Broadcasting</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Benton declared that if Congress cuts off the State Department's "throat" for broadcasting the Voice of America to Europe, it would be a national disaster. According to his statement to radio listeners, he will fight to at least restore his news and cultural programs in this area so that the world can understand the truth about American democracy in order to counter the false propaganda conducted by the Soviet Union. Critics in Congress, despite repeated appeals from Benton, Secretary of State Marshall, and retired Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, decided to cancel the entire program, including shortwave radio broadcasts of the U.S.'s "purely untruthful truth" to foreign countries. Benton refused the advisory committee's suggestion to transfer the broadcasting to private enterprise management. He still insisted that the broadcasting must be sponsored by the State Department.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Clayton to Discuss Economic Policy; The Primary Issue is the Implementation of the Truman Doctrine</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to begin a general review of U.S. international economic policy on the 19th with Under Secretary of State Clayton, who is responsible for economic affairs. The primary issue on the agenda will be the steps to implement the Truman Doctrine, which is how to provide economic assistance to countries willing to resist communist forces. Clayton is currently attending the preparatory meeting of the International Trade Organization organized by eighteen countries in Geneva and is expected to fly back to Washington on the evening of the 18th. After Acheson resigns in mid-June, Clayton will be the only remaining senior official in the State Department. During the coming years of economic crisis, Clayton will be Marshall's trusted right-hand man. The reason for the Marshall-Clayton meeting is that senior U.S. officials believe that there is a possibility of a world economic crisis before the end of this year. It is estimated that in order to implement Truman's policy, the United States will need to lend approximately US$5 billion per year in loans to various countries in need, especially Western European countries, in recent years. Congressional leaders in the U.S. predict that Congress - especially the current Congress - will not be able to pass any global economic relief plan. Although the amount of $5 billion per year has been mentioned in many quarters, no government official has publicly estimated it. A large part of this amount may come from peacetime lend-lease. Some Democrats from various states in the western United States have said that if the United States had spent $1 billion to fight for peace after World War I, World War II could have been avoided.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations Underway in Moscow</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Regarding the revision of the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance, it is reported that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Patrick Petrie, is currently in negotiations with the Soviet government on this matter, according to political figures here. It is said that when the Foreign Ministers of the four powers began their meeting in Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presented the British government with a new draft, prohibiting either signatory from concluding treaties of friendship with any country deemed unfriendly by the other signatory. The British government did not accept this draft at the time and only submitted its counter-proposal to the Soviet government a few days ago. The Soviet authorities now appear to have verbally notified Ambassador Petrie of their views, and Foreign Minister Molotov will soon notify Foreign Secretary Bevin whether the British counter-proposal is accepted as the basis for future negotiations.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Strongly Opposes Appointment of New Deal Personnel</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on the 20th regarding the appointment of [Name] as the United States representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Republican leaders are preparing to staunchly oppose the movement to appoint New Deal personnel to senior government positions. Leading this movement is Committee Chairman Vandenberg, the most influential Republican spokesman on foreign policy, who recently requested that Truman withdraw the nomination of [Name]. Vandenberg has expressed agreement with Truman's other diplomatic appointments, but he believes it is necessary to block the appointment of [Name], and that the time for this movement is ripe. He says that [Name] cannot implement Truman's bipartisan foreign policy because he is an extreme New Dealer.</p>
<h3>Truman's Mother Seriously Ill</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: Truman telegraphed that his mother's condition has improved.</p>
<p>[United Press, Grandview, Missouri, 19th] Truman's elderly mother, aged ninety-four, is critically ill. There was a slight improvement yesterday morning, but her condition worsened again in the afternoon. Her heart is weak and her condition is particularly worrying.

<h3>Economic Administrative Agreement Established for British and American Zones in Germany; Three Key Points Included</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hamburg, 18th] The German News Agency today issued an official statement that the economic administrative agreement established by the commander of the British zone in Germany, [Name], and the commander of the American zone, [Name], includes three key points: (1) An agreement on the allocation and joint use of British and American funds to revive German industry and promote Germany's import and export plans. (2) Strict regulations on the administrative and legislative powers of the five administrative agencies in the two zones. (3) A principle agreement to establish an Economic Committee. The powers of the Economic Committee are still under consideration. Its members will be elected by the German states in proportion to their population. Once established, it will have the powers of a legislative body within certain restrictions. In addition, a central administration is planned, composed of one representative from each state, which will be able to issue directives to the authorities of the two zones based on the decisions of the Economic Committee and obtain their reports.</p>
<h3>Christian Socialists Take Lead in French Zone Referendum</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Baden, Germany, 19th] Legislative elections and a referendum were held yesterday in three districts of the French-occupied zone of Germany. The results show that the constitution drafted by the provisional government of the districts has been passed, and the Christian Social Party has achieved an unprecedented victory. However, the majority was very narrow, especially in the Rhineland-Palatinate district, where the majority was only 52.8%. Many voters in the Palatinate district even opposed the draft constitution, and it was only saved by the support of the Rhineland district. In the elections, the Christian Social Party received a total of 984,531 votes, followed by the Social Democratic Party with 572,667 votes, the Liberal Party with 240,262 votes, and the Communist Party with 159,690 votes. The Rhineland-Palatinate district had the highest number of voters, accounting for 71% of the electorate, followed by the Baden and Württemberg districts. The situation was worse than the previous election. The left-wing parties performed as follows: the Communist Party was slightly weaker, and the Social Democratic Party had a concrete victory. The Liberal Party almost doubled the number of votes it received in the last election. Although the Christian Social Party still dominated, it also suffered some setbacks. It is believed here that the victory of the Social Democratic Party is due to the fact that its leader, [Name], advocated a policy of German unification.</p>
<h3>US Advocates Prompt Discussion of International Gendarmerie Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] The United States delegation today said that the United States will urge the Security Council to immediately discuss the establishment of an international gendarmerie, which was recently put aside due to the United Nations agency's discussion of the Palestine and Greece issues. The Military Staff Committee's initial report on the organization of the international army shows that the Soviet Union has not yet agreed on fundamental principles. This report has been on the Security Council's table since May 1. The US delegation had requested that it be included on the agenda of the early Security Council meetings in May, but it was abandoned because the Soviet Union insisted on discussing the Greek issue first. The discussion of the Palestine issue then further delayed it.</p>

<h3>Egyptian Prime Minister Responds to Bevin's Remarks: British Troops Should Withdraw from Egypt; Sudan and Egypt Have a Real Need to Unite</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 18th] In response to British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement on Egypt in the House of Commons foreign policy debate, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy issued a statement today demanding the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and stating that Egypt cannot accept the continuation of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. He said that the continued presence of British troops in Egypt violates the sovereignty of a free and independent country. The British government knows that the presence of British troops in Egypt violates the wishes of the Egyptian people. We unanimously demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of these troops, and this cannot be conditional on amending the old treaty or concluding a new treaty. The British side has said that if Egypt can agree to the treaty that the British side wants, British troops will be prepared to withdraw, and that unless a new treaty is signed, the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty will continue to be valid, in other words, British troops will continue to be stationed in Egypt. The 1936 treaty was concluded under special circumstances. These conditions no longer exist. The war dangers that existed at that time have long since ended, so the 1936 treaty has achieved its purpose. This treaty violates the United Nations Charter, and we will never allow it to continue. I believe that no member of the United Nations can agree to force us to accept the presence of foreign troops. Britain is also inciting Sudan to secede from Egypt. The unification of Sudan and Egypt is the wish of all the people in the Nile Valley. The freedom of the Sudanese people will not be harmed by this unification. In order to ensure the safety of Sudan and to develop the interests of the Sudanese people, unification is necessary. The presence of British troops in Sudan is the result of the occupation of Egypt, so British troops no longer have the right to be stationed in Sudan. We will now appeal to the United Nations agencies regarding the dispute with Britain. The principle of equal rights of all member states of the United Nations will surely protect our country's rights. Bevin stated in the House of Commons that Egypt is of great importance to the British Empire, so the restoration of the British Empire's peacetime military position is closely linked to this center. It would be unfair to close this center without opening other avenues. Bevin also said that former Egyptian Prime Minister [Name] has already acknowledged this point, but the conditions for British withdrawal are now being rejected by the Egyptian side, and Britain is still basing its position on the 1936 treaty.</p>

<h3>US "Prevention Magazine" Publishes Report on Bacterial Warfare: This Type of Warfare Cannot Be Subjected to International Control</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] "Prevention" magazine, with the permission of the Department of the Army, today published a report by three members of the American Association of Scientists on bacterial warfare, stating that thirty-three types of human and animal diseases are suitable for bacterial warfare, and another thirty-seven types are not suitable. The report, like Smith's report on atomic warfare, lists various possibilities, but retains military secrets. It is said that bacterial warfare does not necessarily have to be used to attack large areas, but can be used to attack special targets, destroying naval and air bases, cities, and factories. The report also discusses various possible attacks and defenses in detail so that the general public can understand the truth about bacterial warfare. It is said that bacterial warfare cannot be subjected to international control for the time being like atomic bombs. Even the smallest countries and obscure medical laboratories can become the source of bacterial weapons. In fact, even before World War II, any bacteriologist in the world could have discovered methods for applying bacteria as long as they had time to do prevention research. Aircraft are almost the best tool for spreading bacteria. The airborne spread of bacteria through inhalation into the human body is the greatest threat. Bacteria in water and food are also mentioned, but they are not considered to be successful. The most useful war bacteria are "Tularemia bacteria," also known as "rabbit fever." This type of bacteria, spread in the air, can cause pneumonia, respiratory plague, and diseases similar to glanders. As for plague bacteria spread by rats and fleas, they are not suitable for warfare because the disease can be eradicated simply by eliminating the rats.</p>

The content will be exactly the same as those signed by Poland and Yugoslavia, that is, it stipulates that if one of the signatories is attacked by another country, the other signatory should immediately provide assistance, but signing a mutual assistance treaty does not mean organizing a group, because organizing a group contradicts Czech foreign policy.</p>

<h3>Flying Star Returns to the Motherland, Carrying Our Captured Officers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Chinese warship "Flying Star," looted by the Japanese army during the war, was recently returned to China. It arrived at Wusongkou on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. This morning, Yao Gengsheng, director of the Shanghai office of the delegation stationed in Japan, will, together with the customs authorities, handle the handover procedures. The Flying Star was originally a customs anti-smuggling ship built by the Jiangnan Shipyard. After being looted by the Japanese army, it was refitted as a warship. This time, it sailed from Japan back to the motherland. Due to the great wind and waves en route, the voyage lasted as long as twelve days. The ship carried eleven of our officers captured by the enemy in North China and Qingdao during the war, as well as iron anchors, artillery shells, etc., seized by Japan during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. The captured officers have been sent to the port headquarters to await dispatch, while the iron anchors, artillery shells, etc., are being kept by the First Naval Base Command.</p>

<h3>Commander Kagezu Was Not Escorted; Two War Criminals Extradited; Only Tanaka Arrived; Taiwan Fugitive Huang Zairong Came Along</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Lieutenant General Tanaka Gunkichi, an important Japanese war criminal who, together with the famous female spy Kawashima Yoshiko, was in charge of espionage work in North China, and Huang Zairong, a major criminal who fled to Japan after the Taiwan Incident, were escorted from Tokyo yesterday and arrived in this city by Jian Guo aircraft at 6 p.m. Tanaka was immediately escorted to the Jiangwan War Criminals Management Office for detention, while Huang Zairong was detained at the Songhu Garrison Command awaiting transfer to Taiwan. As for Major General Kagezu Tadaki, another important Japanese war criminal who single-handedly supported the puppet regime and served as an advisor to the puppet National Government, he was not escorted this time.</p>
<p>When a reporter inquired of Tanaka at the airport, he said that he was from Tokyo, a graduate of the Officer Candidate School. When Japan launched its war of aggression against China, he was active in North China. At that time, his military rank was Army Captain (previously mistakenly reported as Lieutenant General) and belonged to the Takeyama unit. He was in North China for a total of nine years, jointly engaging in espionage work with Kawashima Yoshiko. Before Japan surrendered, Tanaka had been to Nanjing, and by that time he had been promoted to Major. After the surrender, he returned to his country and retired, working at the Tokyo Industrial Patriotic Corporation. On April 28 of this year, he was arrested by the Allied forces stationed in Japan. This was the first time he had been escorted to Shanghai. Huang Zairong also stated that he was from Taipei and had been doing business in Tokyo. He was arrested by the Allied forces last month and did not know the reason. Regarding the "February 28th Incident" in Taipei, he claimed "ignorance." However, according to the reporter's investigation, he had supplied the "rebellious elements" with weapons during the "February 28th Incident," so the Taiwan Garrison Command sent a letter to our delegation stationed in Japan requesting his arrest and repatriation.</p>

<h3>Beer in Season, Workers Strike, Jardine Factory Suffers Great Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Now that summer has arrived, it is the peak season for beer sales. More than 180 workers at the British-owned Jardine Brewery in Yangshupu in this city went on strike suddenly on the 18th because their demands for improved treatment were not met. The factory has suffered great losses and the Bureau of Social Affairs is currently mediating.</p>
<p>According to the labor union, the main cause of the strike was that when the index had not yet been unfrozen, the company secretly increased the base salary of employees by six to seventy yuan. The workers, believing that increasing the base salary violated government regulations, requested that the factory issue a production subsidy based on their work performance. The factory's response to this request was: (1) If the cost of living is not enough to maintain, extra work can be given to increase income. (2) Adults are allowed to pre-draw 200,000 yuan each, and child laborers 150,000 yuan, but it must be deducted in full at the end of the month when salaries are paid. The workers believed that this response did not provide practical help, so they insisted on demanding the supplementary payment of living and production subsidies for the months of February, March, and April when the index was frozen. Starting from May, wages will be paid monthly according to the unfrozen index, and subsidies will be based on the rice price in January of this year, with monthly subsidies thereafter until the rice price and index are equalized. Otherwise, if the base salary of the employees is increased, the workers must also be increased in the same way. In addition, they also demanded that the factory provide worker welfare facilities.</p>
<p>(Another Report) Jinhua Tobacco Factory, commissioned by Delong, specializes in manufacturing cigarettes and employs 335 workers. Recently, due to the rise in tobacco prices, it could not maintain operations and was forced to suspend work on the 13th. All employees are worried about the threat of unemployment and are very concerned about when work can resume. Yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened both parties to mediate, and it was decided that in addition to paying the wages for the first half of May on the 20th, the resumption of work would be discussed further.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Employees from Two Railways Petition Director Lu</h3>
<p>Difficulty in Life Due to Unadjusted Treatment</p>
<p>Employees of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway requested adjustments to fares and treatment. In addition to appealing for support by asking passengers to sign their names, they also held an expanded publicity campaign yesterday and today. On the employee side, because the railway authorities have not yet given a definite answer to the issue of adjusting treatment, they could not wait and sent two representatives, Gao Qifu and Pan Bingqing, standing directors of the labor union, to visit Lu Jingshi, director of the Department of Social Affairs, to ask for mediation. According to the two representatives, the current treatment of employees in the Jinghu area is based on the standard for civil servants, plus 20%. However, the base salary of railway employees is very low, generally around 30 to 40 yuan. According to the new treatment for civil servants, the average income of each employee is only 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. In the past, there was a rice subsidy calculated according to market prices. Recently, the price of rice has soared, but the rice subsidy received by employees is still 30,000 yuan, so it is really not enough to cover expenses. Director Lu expressed great sympathy for their demands and immediately contacted Director Chen of the Railway Bureau to discuss the matter. It is said that he will ask the Ministries of Transportation and Social Affairs to each send senior officials to Shanghai to discuss a solution together with the Railway Bureau and employee representatives.</p>
<h3>Shen Wanqian Was Secretly Reported for Corruption; The District Attorney's Office Conducted Its First Interrogation Yesterday; Lin Xingji and Jiang Weibin Were Released on Bail After Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 10 a.m. yesterday, Prosecutor Chen of the District Attorney's Office investigated a very important corruption and opium case. Shen Wanqian, former commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, is suspected of being heavily involved. It is said that Lin Xingji, a native of Fuqing, Fujian, who is already sixty years old, was suspected of colluding with thugs during the Anti-Japanese War. Because the enemy Lin Wu opened a Lin Ai store at 395 Wusong Road, Hongkou, after the victory, Lin Xingji renamed the store Fuyong Store. In September of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), someone secretly reported to the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, and Shen Wanqian ordered his subordinates to arrest Lin Xingji and found a large number of opium paraphernalia and three catties of opium. Three days later, Jiang Weibin, a native of Fujian, through the introduction of Jiang Gongmei, negotiated with Shen Wanqian to have Lin released on bail. Afterwards, someone secretly reported to the military authorities that Shen Wanqian was corrupt. The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense sent a letter to the capital's judicial organs to investigate. Because the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District Attorney's Office, it was transferred to Shanghai for handling. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the District Attorney's Office ordered Lin Xingji and Jiang Weibin to appear in court and opened the first interrogation hearing. After the interrogation, Lin Xingji and Jiang Xiaoyan were allowed to be released on bail, and a new date was set for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Wusong Seawall Collapsed and Awaiting Repair; Fields Have Been Barren for a Long Time, Eagerly Awaiting Relief Grain; Speaker Visited Wusong and Jiangwan, District Residents Made Several Requests</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] City Council Speaker Pan visited the Wusong and Jiangwan districts yesterday afternoon, accompanied by the district chiefs, chairmen of the district residents' representative assembly, and city councilors. The places visited included Wusong Middle School, the original site of the Pao Taiwan Workers' Public School (now the 101st Rear Hospital for Wounded Soldiers), the Wusong Seawall, the two district government offices, the streets of the two districts, and remote areas.</p>
<p>The results of the Speaker's inspection, and the construction or improvements that the district chiefs hoped for, mainly included the following points: (1) The residents of the Jiangwan and Wusong districts recently heard that the government authorities were distributing food rice to shantytowns, but not to the two districts, causing great panic. Because the government authorities believe that farmers in suburban areas cultivate and eat their own food and do not need to be distributed rice, but the fact is not the case. Because the area was a military zone during the war, the farmland was all used by the Japanese army, and has not been cultivated for many years. It is now impossible to grow rice, resulting in a great shortage of food. Rice stores have not had rice for sale for several days. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities can understand this point and consider the distribution method. (2) The Wusong seawall stone embankment has gradually collapsed, and it is hoped that the public works authorities will expedite repairs.</p>
<p>Hoping to Restore Ferries and Railways</p>
<p>(3) Before the war, the city's ferry service had a wharf in Wusong, with as many as twelve trips per day. Now, only the bottom piles of the wharf remain, and the ferry only makes one trip per day, docking in the middle of the river, causing great inconvenience to passengers and cargo sellers. It is hoped that the service can be restored and the number of trips increased. (4) The Songhu Railway had part of its tracks removed by the enemy during the war, so currently it can only run from Shanghai to Gaojingmiao, which has a major impact on transportation. Moreover, the railway line is one of the earliest railways in our country and has historical value. It is also hoped that it can be restored. (5) The civilian land in Wusong and Jiangwan that was enclosed by the Japanese before has not been returned or purchased at price since the government took over, but farmers are still paying land taxes, which is unfair. It is hoped that the government authorities can quickly decide on a method: return what should be returned, and purchase what should not be confiscated, so that land taxes are no longer paid. (6) The dredging funds for the Zoumatang in Jiangwan are not enough, so it could not be completed. In addition to hoping that the authorities will increase the allocation of materials and expenses, a comprehensive plan should be developed, that is, the Shajing Port, which must be passed by the outlet of the canal, should also be dredged, so that it can be connected to the Huangpu River. Otherwise, even if the Zoumatang can be dredged, it will be futile.</p>
<h3>Tangshan Ship Sails to Pukou, Runs Aground Near Nantong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The new Tangshan ship of the China Shipping Company loaded more than 3,000 tons of edible salt in Tianjin, passed through Shanghai, and was transported to Pukou for unloading. At 3 p.m. yesterday, it ran aground on the river surface near Nantong. After the ship had an accident, it immediately telegraphed the Shanghai office to report. After receiving the telegram, the company rented the Guoqiang steamboat from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and rushed to the scene of the accident overnight to tow and rescue it, and sent personnel to accompany the ship.</p>
<p>No Middle School Established, Difficulty in Continuing Studies</p>
<p>(7) The Jiangwan district is formed by the merger of Jiangwan and Yinhang before the war and covers a large area, but there are only primary schools, making it difficult for children graduating from primary school to continue their studies. It is hoped that the education authorities can add a middle school. (8) There should be public buses running on the Wusong Yixian Road. If the Public Utilities Bureau does not have the funds to do so, it is hoped that the people of Wusong and Jiangwan districts can be allowed to jointly organize a public bus company to operate it. If there is a surplus, it will be used as a fund for public welfare undertakings. (9) The Jiangwan Fire Brigade currently has only one fire truck and the equipment is simple. It is hoped that the city government authorities can further replenish the equipment. Improvements are also hoped for in terms of hygiene and cleaning. There are only three to five cleaners in each of the two districts, so the results of their cleaning can be imagined.</p>
<p>Also, today the Speaker will visit the Dachang and Zhenru districts.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Cultural Association General Assembly Confirms Seven Items of Association Affairs</h3>

<h3>120,000 Tons of Garbage Citywide, Phased Removal to Begin Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a survey by the Sanitation Corps of the Health Bureau, there are 2.4 million stacks of accumulated garbage in various districts of the city, totaling approximately 120,000 tons. Previously, the health authorities requested and obtained the approval of the city government to allocate a special fund of 453.2 million yuan for removal. Now that the height of summer is approaching, the removal work cannot be delayed. Therefore, the relevant agencies convened a meeting to discuss and determine the method of removing accumulated garbage, dividing it into three phases according to the amount of garbage in each district. The first phase includes five districts: Changning, Penglai, Yimiao, Jing'an, and Xuhui. The second phase includes six districts: Yulin, Songshan, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Hongkou, and Xinshijie. The third phase includes the remaining districts. Each phase must be completed within 20 days. Removal tools will be purchased or borrowed by the district government. The funds will be issued according to the number of garbage loads, with 1,200 yuan temporarily issued per load in urban areas and 1,000 yuan per load in suburban areas.

<h3>Public Works Bureau Fire Prevention Plan</h3>
<p>Fire Lanes and Walls Must Be Set Up for Shantytowns</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the fire in the shantytowns in the Nanxing Road, Xinmin Road, and Wuzhen Road area of Zhabei, Zhao Zukang, director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, has paid attention to this. He sent Wang, director of the Construction Division of the bureau, and others to conduct on-site inspections. The fire prevention equipment in the area is really lacking. It is now heard that in order to prevent fires and effectively manage shantytowns, the bureau has designated new road lines and plans to set up fire lanes and firewalls for future shantytown construction. It is stipulated that firewalls must be built at both ends of every 100 feet of shantytowns. The width of the main alley must be at least 16 feet, and the front and back alleys must be 10 feet each. The width of the shantytown bay must be 10 to 11 feet, with a depth of 18 feet along the road and 16 feet inside the alley. The person in charge of the bureau also stated that this expedient measure will not only benefit the residents themselves, but also be conducive to public safety. It is hoped that all citizens will pay attention to and assist in the handling of this matter.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Disaster Victims Suffering, Mayor Approves Relief</h3>

After sending personnel to the disaster area for investigation, relief will be provided.</p>

<p>Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, had previously expressed his desire to retire and was repeatedly comforted and retained by the Ministry of Transportation and the General Bureau of Telecommunications. He resumed seeing to affairs at the bureau on the 19th. All employees of the bureau unanimously expressed their welcome in a passionate mood.</p>

<h3>Two Enemy Support Cases Returned for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Jiang Guozhang, originally the manager of Hongxing Iron Factory, was charged with supporting the enemy with steel. He was previously sentenced to two and a half years in prison by the High Court. The case has now been returned for retrial by the Supreme Court.

<h3>Kong Lingkan Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Determined Not to Be the Owner of the Dawan Evening News</p>
<p>Wang Leshan Should Be Responsible for Repaying Debts</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Xingdao, Lin Shicun, Zhuo Qizhong, Rong Junli, Shen Rongchu, and others, fifteen creditors of the Dawan Evening News, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the District Court, accusing Kong Lingkan, the owner of the Dawan Evening News, and Wang Leshan, the manager, of owing creditors a debt of 17.7 million yuan in national currency, and requesting the court to order the defendants to repay the debt. Yesterday, Judge Ling Yuanqing announced the verdict in the District Court: "Kong Lingkan is not guilty, and Wang Leshan should be responsible for repaying the debt." The reason is that it is insufficient to prove that Kong Lingkan is the owner of the Dawan Evening News. The handwritten order of Kong Lingkan submitted by the plaintiff is purely a private transaction. Therefore, Wang Leshan should repay the debt with the property of the Dawan Evening News, and Wang Leshan should be responsible for repaying the insufficient part.</p>

<h3>Patient's Mouth and Nose Spurted Blood, Died with a Miserable Scream, Surgery Performed at Zhongshan Hospital, Family Members Believed the Cause of Death Was Suspicious, Corpse Was Dissected and Examined Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gu Kanglong, an 18-year-old student from the Guiyang Aviation School, from Nanhui, Pudong, came to Shanghai last month and temporarily resided at the home of his uncle, Gu Xiang, at No. 4, Lane 93, Ximen Road. Unexpectedly, Gu suddenly suffered from nosebleeds. His uncle hired a doctor to diagnose and treat him, but it was ineffective. On April 14, he was sent to Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge for treatment, but it was still ineffective. Until the 16th of this month, the hospital obtained the consent of Gu's family to perform surgery. Due to excessive bleeding, he died in the afternoon of that day. The family members suspected that the hospital was negligent and had caused his death, so they reported the incident to the Changshu Police Branch and sent police officers to summon the hospital doctor, Li Zhaoting, for questioning. They also sent the corpse by car to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy site. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Fang Zheng and forensic doctor Shen Dajun arrived at the scene. Gu Xianglin, the uncle of the deceased, first complained about the incident, saying that the case was divided into three points: (1) Whether there was a need to</p>
<p>Remove the Spleen</p>
<p>The doctor should pay attention to (2) After the operation, the patient was placed in ward No. 4 without a doctor taking care of him, causing a large amount of fresh blood to spurt out of the patient's mouth and nose, and he died with a miserable scream (3) The painful person died at 1:20, and the hospital only notified the family at 2:30. When the family arrived at the scene, the hospital still claimed to dissect the corpse for research into the cause of death. All of the above is enough to prove that the hospital doctor has</p>
<p>Negligent Homicide</p>
<p>The request is to investigate and handle according to law. Doctor Li Zhaoting, 26 years old, from Yin County, assistant doctor at Zhongshan Hospital, said, "The patient was my responsibility for diagnosis and treatment. At about 9 am on the 16th, after obtaining the consent of the patient's family and signing, the chief doctor Li Jiazhong performed the surgery, assisted by doctors such as Min Renyu, Ji Suhua, Qiu Chuanlu, Huang Tianru, and Zhu Minqiang. After the operation, the patient was sent to room No. 4, where I accompanied and nursed him. However, due to the severity of the illness, he died at 1 pm. However, the patient had lost too much blood before his death</p>
<p>He had been transfused with blood</p>
<p>Twelve times, with no effect. The chief doctor determined that the problem could not be fundamentally solved without surgery, so the operation was performed." Prosecutor Fang ordered Li Zhaoting to be released on bail and scheduled the autopsy for 2 p.m. Wei Ligong, chief forensic doctor, and assistant forensic doctors will arrive at the scene at that time to perform the dissection and examination. As a result, the heart, lungs, etc. will be taken out and brought back to wait for detailed research before reporting.</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Association Annual Meeting of Directors, Electing New Directors and Supervisors for the Next Term</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association held its annual meeting at the YMCA at 4:30 pm yesterday. Yan Huiqing, chairman of the association, presided over the meeting, briefly describing the general situation of the association in the past few years, and pointed out the achievements of Dr. Shi Zhaoji and the American branch of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association in supporting the association in New York. Yan said: "Dr. Shi and others in the United States constantly raise donations and medical equipment to China, and recently X-ray equipment worth 10,000 US dollars will be shipped to Shanghai." In addition, Yan expressed his gratitude to the Executive Yuan and the Red Cross Societies of the United States and Britain for their assistance to the association in the past year, to Dr. Wu Shaoqing for presiding over the Second Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital of the association, and to other responsible persons for their enthusiasm for public welfare.</p>

<h3>Students from Universities in Nanjing and Shanghai Scheduled to Resume Classes Automatically Today; Five Universities Including National Central University Issued Declarations to Protect Their Institutions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The wave of strikes at five universities, including National Central University, subsided last night. Most students, feeling that the student movement had deteriorated and that the strikes were hindering their studies, launched a signature campaign to initiate a "Movement to Protect the University and Resume Classes" and organized a committee for the movement. Responders were very enthusiastic. The committee also issued a declaration stating, in part, "We deeply feel that the spirit of broad democracy has been severely threatened. National Central University's bastion of freedom has been transformed into a sea of suffering without freedom, and they are preparing to turn the pure voices of our 4,600 students into shouts of political struggle. We believe that more students than just us feel that this form of petition is a waste. This despotic behavior has tainted the honor of our academic institutions. Out of love for the country and the free will of the entire Chinese nation, we must loudly proclaim and even cry out loud: (1) The government must show its determination to rescue education in its suffering. (2) We want to eat, we want to study. (3) All parties must show conscience and let us go. (4) We firmly oppose petitioning by means of strikes and demonstrations. (5) We especially oppose the purpose of the petition changing midway. (6) We advocate for an immediate resumption of classes."</p>
<p>Jinling University to Resume Classes Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] All faculty members of Jinling University, to persuade students to resume classes as soon as possible and stop participating in demonstrations, convened an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 19th. They resolved that all classes would resume on the 20th and passed a letter to all students, stipulating that all faculty members, regardless of whether they have classes or not, must arrive at the school at the designated time on the morning of the 20th. The faculty members are also willing to stay at the school all day to supervise. In addition, a class resumption organization has been formed by the students. Therefore, the issue of strikes by some students at the university is expected to come to an end.</p>
<p>National Pharmacy College Withdraws from Petition</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The "National Central University, Jinling University, National Pharmacy College, National Drama College, and National Music Academy" in Nanjing originally planned to petition the Executive Yuan and the Political Council on the 20th, demanding increased education funding and supplementary food expenses. All students of the National Pharmacy College were deeply moved after reading Chairman Chiang's speech to the youth on maintaining social order. The student self-government association convened a general student meeting at 11:30 AM on the 19th and resolved to withdraw from the Nanjing Five Universities' demonstration and petition organization with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Shanghai University Presidents Resolved to Order Immediate Resumption of Classes</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] The presidents of universities and colleges in Shanghai held a joint meeting yesterday. After the meeting, they issued a statement stating that, in view of the central government's strict order to prohibit strikes and demonstrations, and for the sake of protecting the students and their studies, the presidents unanimously resolved to order the immediate resumption of classes. They also requested professors to persuade the students, and if the students remain unrepentant, they will take strict measures in accordance with the Ministry of Education's orders.</p>
<p>Fudan University to Resume Classes Today</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] The majority of students at Fudan University opposed the "Eat Up" and "Just Eat" movement and launched a signature campaign yesterday to demand the resumption of classes. The campaign was launched by students Jiang Yingsheng, Wu Jiaxiang, and dozens of others, who issued a declaration stating that strikes are a loss for all students and demanding the immediate resumption of classes. After the declaration was issued, students responded and signed their names. By last night, the number of signatures had reached 1,487. These students also invited President Zhang Yi of the university to speak to all students at 2:00 PM yesterday. According to the original plan, classes were to resume yesterday morning, but many professors were unable to arrive in time due to receiving late notice. Only one class in the Department of Civil Engineering held class as usual. In the afternoon, the university announced a suspension of classes due to the president's speech, but the university announced that all classes would resume today.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's Sincere Speech</p>
<p>At 2:15 PM, President Zhang delivered a speech to over 800 students in the university's auditorium. His speech generally stated that the student unrest at the university was initiated last Friday afternoon by students from outside the university who requested to participate. As for the strike, it was decided by the joint council of department representatives. The organization of the joint council of department representatives is illegal and therefore invalid. Furthermore, the demand for increased funding and improved staff and student benefits is very reasonable, but it must be done through proper channels by submitting requests to the authorities. As for opposing the civil war, not only students but also the entire nation hopes for this, but the civil war involves both sides, and petitions should be submitted to both sides. The name "Eat Up" movement seems inappropriate. Currently, there may be insufficient nutrition, but there is no evidence of starvation. Furthermore, there is a so-called "Rescue Education Movement," which I find very distressing. To rescue education, stability is necessary first, and strikes create instability. Truth cannot be obtained by means of propaganda and shouting slogans. Furthermore, students' demand to attend classes is a basic demand and a responsibility of the school. The university will not allow students to use force to prevent other students from attending classes. Finally, he announced that classes would resume at 8:00 AM tomorrow (i.e., today). He concluded his speech at 2:45 PM amidst applause. In addition, students Jiang Yingsheng and Wu Jiaxiang, along with 1,487 others, requested the Fudan University authorities yesterday to: (1) Immediately publicly dissolve the so-called Joint Council of Department Representatives and pursue the responsibility of those responsible for the illegal leadership of the strike. (2) Order the Rescue Education Movement Assembly to cease activities immediately. (3) Request the school to immediately send a telegram to the Ministry of Education denying the university's petition representatives.

<h3>Six Thousand University Students in Shanghai Marching to See off the Representatives Going to Nanjing for Petitioning</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] The National Government's clearly stated "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" and Chairman Chiang's speech on rectifying academic style and safeguarding the rule of law were only disclosed in yesterday's newspapers, but students from national universities and colleges in Shanghai still held a large-scale march yesterday. The "Eat Up" and "Just Eat" movement, originally promoted, was opposed by the majority of students and was renamed the "Save Education Crisis Movement." However, the slogans shouted and posters displayed during the march by the students yesterday still had a very strong political color, exceeding the scope of the original demands of the students. The following is a record of the march yesterday: Students from national universities and colleges in Shanghai, in response to the student unrest at National Central University and Jinling University in Nanjing, sent representatives to Nanjing for petitioning, departing by train at 11:00 AM yesterday morning.

Approximately 6,000 students from various universities participated in the send-off. After the train departed, the students who saw them off departed from the North Railway Station to hold a hunger march. Responsible persons of the security agencies sincerely advised them not to disturb public order and obstruct traffic, but the chairman of the marching student delegation refused. At 11:30 AM, the delegation, led by a car, departed and marched along North Henan Road, through Nanjing Road, turned west to West Tibet Road, south into East Zhongzheng Road, east to East Zhongshan Road (the Bund), and then north. At 1:45 PM, they arrived at the Bund Park, covering a full circle of the central urban area. Along the way, the police cavalry and police officers tried to dissuade them, but to no effect.

<h3>British University Students in Nanjing Petition the Ministry of Education Yesterday – Stalemate All Day Resolved by Lei Zhen as Mediator</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Students from British universities in Nanjing petitioned the Ministry of Education on the 19th, resulting in a stalemate from morning until evening. The Ministry of Education did not provide a response, and Lei Zhen stepped in as a mediator. Lei’s response to the students was met with approval by the majority of the students. Over two hundred British university students participated in the petition. They gathered at Central University at 10:00 AM on the 19th, marched in formation, and chanted slogans along the way. Upon hearing the news, the police authorities, in accordance with temporary measures for maintaining public order, dispatched a team to the front of the Ministry of Education to maintain order. When the students arrived at the ministry, the main gate was tightly secured. The police and students remained in a standoff for a long time. In the afternoon, the students managed to enter the gate, sat on the ground, and requested to see Zhu Jiahua. The Ministry of Education refused to meet with them because the students did not send ten representatives. After persuasion from Yang Gongda, former president of the British University, the students nominated ten representatives and requested Lei Zhen, who had attended the Ying Shi Memorial Meeting on the 18th, to assist in the negotiations. On the 18th, Lei addressed the students, responding to three points: (1) The Ministry of Education is currently searching for a university president and will resolve the issue soon. (2) The medical school has not been restored due to insufficient talent and equipment, and several other schools have not been restored for the same reason. The Ministry of Education has no intention to suppress it and will strive to promote its restoration in the future. (3) The location of the school was determined by the Education Conference, and the Ministry of Education cannot resolve it and must wait for the National Education Conference to be held this autumn to discuss it. Lei also advised the students to return, leaving only ten representatives. Most of the students expressed satisfaction with Lei’s response and applauded, departing together. A small number who did not leave were sternly persuaded by the police and also quickly returned to Central University.</p>

<h3>Stock Exchange Resumed Trading Yesterday – Chinese Stocks Fell Across the Board – All Parties Quietly Awaiting New Ministry Order</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The stock exchange opened yesterday amidst wavering sentiments. Both buyers and sellers engaged in an unprecedented battle, causing fluctuations in the prices of various stocks. Cantonese and Northern syndicates, as well as the yarn factory syndicate, were very active in buying. Prices rose after falling, but the cancellation of forward delivery, the yarn factory strike, huge adverse balances in national banks, and frequent telegrams reporting rising prices in Hong Kong and Shanghai finally led to a forced decline. The suggestions made by the Green Brokers Association were met with much speculation before the Ministry order arrived, giving speculators the opportunity to create rumors. It is reported that after the market closed lower yesterday, off-market trading disappeared. The stock exchange authorities were particularly strict with market access yesterday. Each broker was limited to a maximum of three people entering the market with credentials. According to the stock exchange spokesperson, this measure aims to prevent non-professionals from entering the market and disrupting prices. According to yesterday's situation, neither the stock exchange authorities, the financial and economic ministry supervisors, nor the brokers had any new measures, as they were all waiting for the new ministry order to be issued.</p>
<p>Early Morning</p>
<p>Very few spot transactions were opened, with Tongyi slightly declining, An rising to the limit, Jinglun falling to the limit, and Rongfeng remaining unchanged. When forward delivery Yongshen opened with a limit down, people panicked. Tongyi, Xinguang, Xinhua, Jingfu, Jinglun, Match, Meiya, China Silk, Xinya, Xinhe, and Qinxing all fell to the limit. Forward delivery Yongshen had a large number of transactions at the limit down, and off-market prices were reported higher. After 10:00 AM, Rongshen first rose to the limit. Numbers 14, 162, 85, 121, 65, 28, 105, 89, 106, and 153 all advanced, rising to 6,400 yuan. Numbers 142, 185, 143, 30, 231, and 152 were closed out at high prices and fell to the limit again. Numbers 162, 172, 173, 94, 129, and 155 took advantage of the low prices to advance to 6,200 yuan, and Yonggong also fell to the limit. Numbers 185, 85, 223, 224, and 65 were sold off, forcing forward delivery Yongshen down to around 6,050 yuan. Number 1622 kept buying, as did numbers 143 and 94. Later, because off-market prices were reported higher again, and there were rumors of yarn factories increasing capital, at 10:40 AM, numbers 171, 232, 35, 153, 89, 224, 149, and 105 all advanced. After 10:40 AM, forward delivery Yongshen rose to 7,080 yuan, and numbers 61, 77, 95, 107, 85, and 32 were sold at high prices and then saw downstream. Numbers 89, 180, 160, 152, 77, and 78 were more willing to move. Hong Kong telegrams rose, falling back to 6,350 yuan. Numbers 4, 35, 143, and 119 took advantage of the low prices to advance to 6,700 yuan, while number 180 and others were still closing out, struggling to close at around 6,550 yuan at noon, and slightly declining after the close. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongshen and Xinhe slightly rose, Meiya rose to the limit, and Qinxing and Xinhua fell to the limit. Yonggong, Xinguang, and Jingfu each fell by more than 10%. Forward delivery Yongshen and Meiya slightly declined, Xinhe, Xinguang, and Yonggong fell by more than 10%, and Jingfu and Qinxing fell to the limit. Cold stocks Rongjue and Lian rose to the limit, Datong, China Silk, Match, Jinglun, and Xinya fell to the limit, and Commerce, Tongyi, and Cement fell to the limit and then recovered, each falling by more than 10%.</p>

<p>The market was still stable in the morning, with Lian and Rongfeng rising to the limit. Numbers 83, 224, 160, 222, and 155 all advanced, and forward delivery Yongshen rose to 6,710 yuan. Later, there were sudden rumors of a yarn factory strike, and numbers 154, 213, 224, 190, 65, 109, 94, 105, 185, and 180 were all sold off, causing a sudden decline. Datong, Yonggong, Cement, China Silk, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinguang, China Textile, Tongyi, Xinhua, and Jinglun all fell to the limit, and forward delivery Yongshen even fell to 6,050 yuan. Numbers 91, 31, 14, 23, and 89 came in to advance, rising to 6,300, and number 89 also advanced, with Meiya showing a slight improvement. Unfortunately, the four banks and two bureaus had an adverse balance of 40 billion, and Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams rose again to 18 yuan. Match was suspended from trading by number 17, and numbers 199, 94, 153, 154, 36, 157, 223, 224, 4, and 183 were closed out. Ten minutes before the close, forward delivery Yongshen was also forced down to the limit. Except for Rongfeng and Lian, the whole market was black. As a result, compared to last Saturday, spot transactions, except for Yongshen, which did not have any transactions in the afternoon, and Rongfeng and Lian, which rose to the limit, all fell to the limit. Forward delivery all fell to the limit. Off-market old stocks, Zhabei Dasheng and China saw gains, Huashang Wuzhou remained unchanged, and the rest saw slight declines.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Decline</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks followed Chinese stocks yesterday, either rising or falling. Yisha opened at 76,000 yuan in the morning, rose to 83,000 yuan in the middle of the day, and fell back to 77,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, Hong Kong's telegraph rose again to 18 yuan, and the supply exceeded the demand, causing it to fall again to 70,000 yuan at the closing price. As a result, compared to last Friday, the steel industry slightly declined, Hanglai and Jardine Matheson fell by half a percent, British Union and Ya Beer fell by 10%, and Yisha and Ya Paper each fell by half a percent.</p>
<h3>Unified Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Government bonds were only flat and weak yesterday. Unified C opened at 15,000 yuan, rose from 14,600 yuan to 15,300 yuan, and finally remained within 15,000 yuan. Number 360 had sales, and numbers 503 and 552 advanced, with transactions of about 5 million. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B fell by 600 yuan, C fell by 500 yuan, D fell by 300 yuan, and E fell by 800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Cables the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus to Thoroughly Investigate Black Market Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company in this city has had cotton yarn allocation prices that are far lower than market prices in previous years, and not even sufficient to cover the cost of raw cotton. Recently, yarn prices have skyrocketed and the black market is rampant. The total difference between the allocated prices and the black market prices in previous years has reached 6.7 billion yuan. However, the common people have not benefited, only enriching merchants and damaging the national treasury. Even the products of other yarn factories should be sold at negotiated prices, but most are sold on the black market and entered into the accounts at negotiated prices, further reducing government tax revenue. According to the national budget for this year, the company was assessed to pay a surplus of 400 billion yuan. Unexpectedly, it must request the national treasury to subsidize it, and it had no choice but to submit a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs a few days ago to quickly eliminate the black market. It is now known that the Ministry has cabled the city police bureau and social affairs bureau to jointly investigate the allocation status of the Textile Construction Company and the Textile Management Committee, and to thoroughly investigate the actual situation of black market yarn prices, in order to normalize yarn and cloth transactions.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Transport to Hankou: Manufacturer Registration Reaches 36 Companies with Over 300 Items</h3>
<p>Since the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee (紡管會) began registering manufacturers transporting yarn and cloth to or through Hankou last week, registration has been quite active, reaching over 300 items as of yesterday. Yesterday, 36 companies registered. The committee has set this Friday as the registration deadline. Furthermore, the registration of manufacturers transporting yarn and cloth to the North will be reviewed and completed by the committee soon, and notices will be issued shortly. Qualified manufacturers will be issued certificates to present when reporting for transport, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday in the yarn market, dyeing and weaving factories showed strong demand for 20-count yarn. 42-count and 40-count fine yarns saw reduced demand because poplin manufacturing has ceased. 42-count Blue Phoenix sold for 1,240,000 yuan, only increasing by 50,000 yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse sold for 7,300,000 yuan, rising by 150,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn sold for 7,100,000 yuan, increasing by 300,000 yuan. Blue Phoenix sold for 7,200,000 yuan, rising by 400,000 yuan. 16-count coarse yarn sales were slow, and the price remained stable. The Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) opened yarn sales as usual, with prices similar to the previous period.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Prices Soar</h3>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, all types of cloth showed positive trends in off-exchange trading after Saturday afternoon, and industry insiders made considerable purchases. At the opening, it was heard that the Textile Construction Company's 3A Colorful Ball fine cloth and second-grade Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge, sold the previous day, were distributed by number, further exciting the market. Merchants from other provinces stationed in Shanghai rushed to buy, and speculative capital from securities firms also entered the market, causing extreme tightness and soaring prices. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once rose to 330,000 yuan, but profit-taking caused it to fall back to 300,800 yuan in the end, a sharp increase of 23,000 yuan compared to Saturday. Various brands such as Five Blessings Colorful Ball also rose by 14,000-15,000 to 21,000-22,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, twill serge, dyed cloth, and shirting all rose sharply, from 10,000 to over 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Bank and Bureau Checks Show a Deficit of 18.8 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In recent days, national banks and bureaus have frequently shown deficits in check clearing. Yesterday, the deficit was 18.8 billion yuan. According to an analysis by a certain expert, this deficit is mostly due to foreign exchange remittances, government sales of materials (such as the yarn and cloth of the China Textile Corporation), and tax payments. The expert stated that as a result of recent price fluctuations, the amount of currency in circulation in the market is once again insufficient, causing deposits in banks to flow into the market. Deposits of various banks and firms in the Central Bank have recently been withdrawn, amounting to two-thirds of the total. This capital has entered the market but has not yet returned. However, the expert observed that the market's money supply is unlikely to loosen in the near future. The quota for the second period of imports has already been announced, and rumors of an adjustment to the foreign exchange rate are rampant. Therefore, many importers are rushing to settle foreign exchange early, and a large amount of legal tender is expected to return to the market successively, it is said.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Committee Discusses Remedial Measures for Export Trade: Principles Established, Central Trust Bureau to Draft Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting at the Central Bank yesterday morning from 10:30 AM, attended by Chen Guangfu, Liu Gongyun, Shen Xirui, Ren Sida, Chen Junren, and advisors Ma Ge and Bai Yien. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. The committee spent a long time discussing remedial measures for export trade, but no definitive conclusion was reached. The meeting will continue today. It is reported that due to domestic market prices being higher than international prices, exports of major commodities such as tung oil and bristles have stagnated recently. Merchants in various regions are requesting the authorities to purchase and remedy the situation to facilitate unified export sales. It is understood that the Export Promotion Committee has drafted several major principles for remedial measures, which have been submitted to the Central Trust Bureau to draft implementation measures. The Central Trust Bureau is currently drafting these measures, which may be submitted to the Executive Committee meeting of the Export Promotion Committee for discussion and approval today, it is said.</p>
<h3>Production Area Prices Soar: Rice Prices Track Upward: Flour Rationing to Resume Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving in the northern and southern markets was about 10,000 dan (石). Market conditions were characterized by sharp increases in inland areas, tracking upward. Japonica and Indica rice prices rose uniformly by over 10,000 yuan. However, the flour market, after weakening, recovered and rose by 4,000-5,000 yuan. Bran factories continued operations, with goods arriving from Hankou. Actual sales continued, maintaining a stable position.</p>
<p>Soybean cake prices initially rose and then stabilized, increasing by 1,000 yuan. Soybeans remained sluggish.</p>
<p>Mung beans remained scarce and trading was slow, remaining stagnant. Red beans saw active trading, rising by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Red sorghum sales to distilleries were brisk, continuing to rise by 5,000-6,000 yuan. Corn from Qingdao continued to rise, soaring by 20,000 yuan, but eased at the close. Raw peanuts were widely sold, continuing to rise sharply by over 10,000 yuan. Sesame followed, rising by 3,000-5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, rationing of flour in this city has been suspended since last Friday, as the five flour mills, including Fuxin, have run out of their own flour. The Ministry of Food has decided that from now until the new wheat season, all flour rationing in this city will be the responsibility of the Central Trust Bureau. According to Chief Ji of the Social Affairs Bureau, the official document arrived at the city government on the 13th, and the Social Affairs Bureau only received it yesterday. Therefore, flour rationing will remain suspended today but will resume tomorrow, with a quantity of 20,000 bags, of which 10,000 bags will make up for today's suspension, it is said.</p>
<p>Flour and Bran Market Planned</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flour and Bran Commercial Guild held a meeting of member representatives at 2:00 PM yesterday. Relevant authorities from the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to attend and provide guidance, and alternate directors and supervisors were re-elected. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) A proposal to establish a flour and bran market was resolved to appoint Zhang Chao, Lu Yuanxiang, Zhou Yanchao, Li Binyuan, and 12 others to form a preparatory committee. (2) A proposal to establish a guild hall was approved in principle, and specific measures will be planned in consultation with the Retailers' Association and representatives of wholesalers and all directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Tighten</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, white sugar saw considerable demand, and prices continued to tighten. Green and red sugars also showed positive signs. The guild set prices for Peruvian sand sugar at 426,000 to 428,000 yuan, an increase of nearly 20,000 yuan. Taichung sand sugar was at 400,000 yuan, Shantou green sugar at 270,000 yuan, and Huanggang green sugar at 265,000 yuan. Ordinary cotton red sugar was at 275,000 yuan, and Xinghua white high-grade sugar was at 385,000 to 390,000 yuan, with lower grades at 370,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar was at 190,000 to 285,000 yuan, with lower grades at 280,000 yuan, all rising by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Hainan sugar was also quoted at 270,000 yuan, but no transactions were made.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Considers Eliminating Negotiated Pricing System</p>
<p>Since the Taiwan Sugar Corporation began rationing sugar, the rationed price has been lower than the market price. However, last month, black market prices soared, exceeding the rationed price by more than double. As a result, general users did not benefit, so the company suspended rationing. Rationing to sugar merchants was resumed the week before last after adjusting the rationed price. However, the market price still far exceeds the legal profit margin, so the company is considering eliminating the negotiated pricing system and adopting a flexible policy of selling at market prices. Detailed measures are being submitted to the authorities for review.</p>
<h3>Auction of Old Tea for Export: Approximately 4,000 Cases Sold</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau previously held a public auction for over 10,000 cases of old tea for export. Amidst the current slump in exports, interest was not strong. It is now understood that Jardine Matheson, Wu Chang, and Dada Chang Tea Companies have purchased approximately 4,000 cases, while the remainder remains unsold. The foreign-owned tea market, which has been sluggish for a long time, continues to trend towards gloom, as buyers, mindful of the meager prices offered from abroad, are hesitant, and there is a sense of apprehension. On the other hand, sales of domestic tea by local shops and merchants remain stable.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Opens Yesterday: Red Trading Plate Stable: Oil Pressing Industry Reaches Satisfactory Agreement on Purchasing Rapeseed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Oil Industry Market officially opened at 10:00 AM yesterday, with a grand opening ceremony. Over a hundred people attended, including government officials, with Mayor Wu represented by Wang Guanqing, the Social Affairs Bureau represented by Ji Mingzhai, and other guests. Chairman Zhang Chao reported on the preparations for the market. Mayor Wu's representative, Wang Guanqing, then delivered a speech, urging the industry to prioritize benefiting itself, the people, and the country. Oil is a major food for the people, and it is hoped that the market will develop normally and suppress market prices. Guests then delivered speeches, and the ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM. Members of the industry entered the market and began trading on the red trading plate. Buying and selling were quite balanced, and market conditions were very stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market showed little activity. Raw oil sales continued from merchants, with prices rising by another 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil supply was still adequate, and market conditions were flat. Vegetable oil demand was sluggish, with prices falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil remained unchanged, and sesame oil saw little fluctuation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] To request assistance from the Central Trust Bureau in purchasing rapeseed to replenish oil pressing raw materials, representatives from China Vegetable Oil Factory Zhang Decheng, Dade Xin Zhou Weibao, and Dayou Yu Xie Yuxiang, Tongsheng Tai Yu Liangji, and others visited the Central Trust Bureau yesterday to discuss implementation measures with Deputy Director Shen Xirui. The discussions were very satisfactory, and it has been decided to follow the original plan for the Central Trust Bureau to assist the oil pressing industry in promoting purchasing in rapeseed production areas such as Suzhou, Pinghu, and Wuhu to prevent the opportunity from passing and the rapeseed from falling into the hands of hoarders, forming hoarded commodities and causing raw material prices to soar. It is reported that the purchasing operation will be jointly managed by the accounting department of the Central Trust Bureau, branch directors and office directors in various regions, responsible persons from the audit department's offices in various regions, and one representative dispatched by the oil pressing industry.</p>
<p>Orchid and Bamboo Branch Flower Seedling Production Areas Show Signs of Shortage</p>
<p>According to information from merchants, this year's new orchid and bamboo branch flower seedlings have recently shown signs of shortage, so goods stored in Shanghai are not being sold cheaply and remain in conservative hands. However, actual sales are relatively rare, and there is no immediate hope for expansion.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Expected to Rise: Raw Material Market Conditions Firm</h3>
<p>The black market Hong Kong exchange rate is rising frequently. The only source of raw materials is Hong Kong, so sentiment is positive. Yesterday afternoon, trading was even more active, and prices of various goods were firm. Popular items such as caustic soda, N rosin, and Vaseline mostly rose, and there were no signs of weakness in the market.</p>
<h3>Importers and Exporters Request Cancellation of Time Limit for Settling Consignment Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Importers and Exporters Guild and the Hide, Fur, Oil, and Bone Commercial Guild jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Finance yesterday regarding the national banks' time limit for settling sales of consigned goods, requesting the cancellation of the time limit. The telegram stated that Chinese merchants promote exports by using consignment sales methods, where goods are first shipped abroad and entrusted to designated domestic banks, which in turn entrust them to foreign banks for storage and safekeeping, allowing foreign buyers to inspect samples and sell at a price. Exporters and foreign buyers communicate prices by telegram, and once agreed, the domestic designated bank informs the foreign entrusted bank to collect payment and deliver the goods. This practice has been established for a long time and is convenient for both parties. Unexpectedly, in March of this year, the Central Bank suddenly stipulated that all existing export goods must be sold and settled by May 24, otherwise, the foreign designated bank would be instructed to carry out "unlimited price" sales. The news spread, and domestic exporters were at a loss. The foreign market took the opportunity to suppress prices. It is believed that if exports increase by one point and the selling price increases by one point, our exporters can settle more foreign exchange with the government. Conversely, a time limit for settlement is equivalent to ordering a cheap sale. If there is a temporary lack of buyers due to seasonal or needs-related reasons, it is tantamount to handing someone a knife, allowing exporters to be slaughtered. Our government may obtain a small amount of foreign exchange temporarily, but the impact will directly force exporters into bankruptcy and indirectly cause domestic products to stagnate.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Rationing Price Unchanged: Additional Security Deposit of 4 Million Yuan Per Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau resumed rationing artificial silk yesterday, based on one-quarter of the application volume from silk weaving and ribbon weaving companies in December of last year (including the portion of silk weaving companies' subcontracted products), totaling approximately 500 cases. This rationing is nominally a temporary loan. The price of Tianqiao brand is 5.5 million yuan per case, Jin San Ma and Dongyang brands are 5.3 million yuan per case, and Zao Ri and Gaoshan brands are 5.2 million yuan per case. In addition to paying with an immediate check, a security deposit of 4 million yuan is also required, which can be paid with a time draft. After the Executive Yuan approves the new selling price, any overpayment will be refunded, and any underpayment will be supplemented. It is reported that payment for this batch of rationed goods is due this Thursday, and delivery can be made this Saturday, it is said.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market was stable but weak. 120-count Gaoshan bright silk opened at 17 million yuan, and short sellers absorbed some, but the asking price gradually increased, reaching 17.7 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the highest asking price was 17.3 million yuan, but it finally fell back to 16.9 million yuan, down 300,000 yuan from the end of last week.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still rare yesterday. 10 bales of grade C were traded in the morning, priced at 20.07 million yuan. Several bales were also traded in the afternoon, priced at 20.09 million yuan with a five-day time draft. Asking prices for other grades were similar to those of last Saturday, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the asking price for Meiya bedding silk was 18.8 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan from the end of last week. Dachen checkered crepe fluctuated around 32,000 yuan. Someone wanted it on a deferred payment basis at 2,300 yuan. The ex-factory price of Chongdian power spun silk was 260,000 yuan, so the market price has increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Prices for other goods did not fluctuate.</p>
<h3>Palecas Sells Well</h3>
<p>The circulation of feather yarn tweed in the market is quite scarce, and the selling price is extremely high, with a rather brisk trend. Striped, checkered, and solid colors are in greater demand than supply, and most are "available but not for sale." The limited inventory among merchants is only enough to meet the needs of their own retail stores. Demand for Palecas is more widespread. Number one is selling briskly at 260,000-270,000 yuan per yard, number two at 230,000-240,000 yuan, and number three at around 200,000 yuan. Xie Xin, Zhang Hua, Yin Feng, and Run Feng Xian have issued current orders. In terms of actual sales, local Chinese clothing shops have been the main buyers recently, while merchants from other provinces mostly purchased everything earlier. For Western suits, Fan Er Ding is the most popular, with light gray solid colors being the most active, and beige colors being lower in price, it is said.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Schedules Meeting with Industrial Guilds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting with various industrial guilds at 3:00 PM this Thursday to discuss: (1) Guarantee measures for importers selling key raw materials to manufacturers. (2) Revision of import and export trade measures, and how to provide revision opinions.</p>
<h3>Bristles Attract Interest</h3>
<p>Rumors about foreign exchange continue unabated, and the market is speculating that the upcoming National Political Council may make suggestions for changes. Large, sensitive investors were buying bristles in the market yesterday, causing the bristle market to rise by one to two tenths. Other export commodities were also being targeted for acquisition.</p>
<h3>Fresh Meat Prices Rise Sharply for Days</h3>
<p>Fresh meat prices have risen sharply, with retail prices already exceeding 620,000 yuan. The reason is the increase in taxes and production area prices. However, the city's "Lei Qi Su," a month-long vegetarian period, is approaching, so sales have decreased sharply, and weakness is on the horizon.</p>
<h3>Four Banks to Appropriately Increase Loan Amount</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is reported that the planned loan for this year's spring cocoons was 120 billion yuan, as the estimated price of fresh cocoons was 400,000 yuan per dan (祖) when the plan was decided. However, due to the sharp rise in rice prices, reaching 1 million yuan per dan, the originally planned loan amount is insufficient. As a result, the responsible person of the China Sericulture Corporation consulted with the headquarters of the Four Banks in Nanjing. The Four Banks headquarters has agreed to appropriately increase the loan amount based on actual needs. Furthermore, the Silk Production and Sales Guidance Association will be urging manufacturers to pay the 10% down payment for the loan in the coming days, it is said.</p>

<h3>Public Burial of Martyr Zhang Xinfu</h3>
<p>— Shenyang, 12th (Air Patrol, Northeast Press)</p>
<p>The burial ceremony of Martyr Zhang Xinfu, held in Shenyang on May 11, was unprecedented in its grandeur. Over 40,000 people from all walks of life participated. Women emptied the streets, and roads were blocked. Wreaths piled up like mountains, and the solemn atmosphere was difficult to describe. Recalling that on July 1st two years ago, Mr. Zhang Xinfu was appointed to take over the Fushun Coal Mine and was subsequently stabbed to death by Communist soldiers, suffering as many as eleven knife wounds. The news was shocking, and the entire country mourned his loss. In addition to his wife, Martyr Zhang also left behind three sons. The Martyr's memorial hall was set up in the Guandi Temple in Shenyang. Family memorial services were held from the 9th, public memorial services on the 10th, and the burial took place on the side of Beiling on the 11th. The tomb construction is magnificent, with towering pines and cypresses. Alas! From now on, the loyal soul will be admired by all, and will forever be mourned by future generations!</p>

<h3>Ten Days in Southern Yunnan</h3>
<p>— Kunming Ten-Day Airmail Report by Special Correspondent Xu Jilian</p>
<p>The tin industry in Gejiu is indeed declining. Tin merchants and local gentry often yearn for the past prosperity, when there were 200,000 workers and annual production was nearly 10,000 tons. These things seem to shine only in memories. In the most depressed period, there were only a hundred or so miners left, and the total annual output was less than 200 tons. Comparing the two, it is no wonder that the tin merchants are filled with sighs, as if they were seeing the plight of a young master.</p>
<p>It wasn't until 1945 when several American mining experts suddenly came to Gejiu and conducted a field survey. They believed that the Gejiu tin mine had abundant reserves and great potential. Only then did they reawaken people's attention. In that year, the "gold-for-tin" method was established. In 1946, the tin industry situation slightly improved, but this was not a long-term plan. The revival of the mining industry cannot be achieved by a few experts' empty designs or temporary interests. What is important is a comprehensive and meticulous plan, massive capital, endless labor, and blood and sweat. Only in this way can the Gejiu tin industry be revived!</p>
<p>Gejiu Tin Industry: In Revival</p>
<p>Gejiu's tin production ranks only fourth in the world. Compared with Nanyang's annual production of more than 60,000 tons, it is like a small wizard meeting a great one. However, the Nanyang area is all "placer tin," while Gejiu is "vein tin." The costs are too far apart, making competition difficult. Currently, we can only try to reduce costs as much as possible and use scientific methods for mining and smelting. Otherwise, the future of China's tin industry cannot be optimistic.</p>
<p>Under the explanations of Chief Engineer Ni Xiangcai (a graduate of Beiyang University, a classmate of Mr. Chen Lifu, and recently attended the London Tin Conference) and Associate Manager Lü Lansheng, we began to have a strong interest in the actual engineering situation of the Gejiu tin mining area. Both of them are dedicated practitioners. Under the Yunnan Tin Industry Company, they have contributed all their energy, which is much more practical than those theorists who "talk on paper." There are two types of mine owners in Gejiu: private and public. Of course, there is a considerable distance between the two in terms of capital and methods. Private mine owners are already facing a serious crisis, with a shortage of funds and difficulty in obtaining labor. However, some people are still struggling, waiting for better days to come. The only public mine owner at the moment is the Yunnan Tin Industry Company. The conditions are certainly much better, but there are still many difficulties. The Tin Industry Company was formed in 1940 by merging the Yunnan Tin Affairs Company, the Tin Affairs Office of the Resources Committee, and the Gejiu Tin Smelting Company. It is now funded by the Yunnan Provincial Government with 40% of the shares, and the Resources Committee and the Bank of China each with 30% of the shares. The operating cost is 1 billion yuan. It currently has the Laochang, Malage New Factory, Ore Dressing Plant, Tin Smelting Plant, and Mechanical Plant. To introduce the mining and smelting of tin, in Gejiu, the traditional method occupies a very important place. It accounts for almost 90% or more of the output. This time, we also made a "cursory inspection" and are willing to provide a superficial introduction. The first task of the traditional method is drilling holes. After the mine owner finds the ore vein, they follow the route and first drill out the groove door (commonly known as the entrance). The depth of each hole tip is different, ranging from hundreds of steps to four or five thousand steps. Then, the work of exploring the mine begins inside the cave. The foremen lead the sand miners to find the ore seedlings. After discovering the ore seedlings, they start digging the waste, deciding whether to take or discard it based on the amount of mineral content. The sand miners carry packs of waste weighing 50 to over 100 pounds out of the cave. This work is extremely difficult because the passages in the mine are rugged, narrow, and winding. One has to use a cane to support themselves, walk stooped over with a coal lamp on their head, and the cave does not have ventilation and is often flooded with rainwater. Although there are ventilation and drainage facilities, the traditional method is often not sophisticated, so the sand miners often faint when climbing out of the cave, which is a miserable sight.</p>
<p>After the tin ore is mined, it is commonly referred to as "waste." The waste contains a lot of mud and impurities, and the composition of the pure ore is inconsistent. The second step is washing. A sluice is set up where the waste is rubbed and the ore is processed. The main equipment is the ore washing tank, the waste crushing tool, and the guard room. Most of the crushed waste is coarse, and the ore is mixed with soil and stones. Before washing, it must be crushed. The traditional method uses a stone mill pulled by horses, pouring in clear water to grind it into a mud slurry to separate the ore from the sand and soil, and then put it into the tank for rinsing.</p>
<p>Tin Needs to be Washed After Mining</p>
<p>After the crushed waste enters the tank, workers use a water scoop to rinse the ore waste, and also use a long bamboo pole to rub and rake it. In this way, the mud slurry flows out from the tank opening and into the water ditch. The heavier waste, which contains more minerals, settles in the tank. At this point, the brick tank washing work is completed. Then comes the work of leveling and washing the tank. Mud slurry and fine mineral sand are flushed into the sedimentation tank with water, and the coarser minerals are left in the tank. After separating the coarse and fine, they are placed in a dustpan and shaken on the water surface. The fine sand falls into the pond, and the coarse slag is piled up separately. When the "ore head" containing 80-90% minerals is obtained, it is put back into the leveling tank, stirred with water, and washed. If there are still coarse mineral particles, they must be ground with a horse mill. The mud slurry obtained from grinding is poured into the board tank, and scooped and washed several times to obtain 80-90% pure ore. The pure ore obtained from rubbing and washing is fine tin sand, which must be smelted in a furnace to become a whole piece of large tin. Therefore, smelting is the last step in the production of large tin.</p>
<p>Final Process: Tin Smelting</p>
<p>Smelting ore sand is calculated at 24 hours per furnace. Each furnace can smelt three shi of ore sand, requiring 3,000 jin of chestnut charcoal. After the furnace charcoal is burned, workers use iron shovels to shovel the ore sand into the soil furnace vat, which is called loading ore. Charcoal must be added each time the ore is loaded. When loading the ore, another worker pulls the bellows to blow air into the vat, making the charcoal fire burn fiercely. When the ore sand is smelting, the fire door must be opened at any time to avoid being blocked by carbon slag. The tin liquid that has already melted in the vat easily flows out from the fire door and settles in the窩子 (wozi, a depression). In this way, the chemical process of smelting tin is that after the pure ore enters the furnace, it encounters a reducing flame. The tin oxide ore is reduced by charcoal to become pure tin and carbon dioxide, which can be expressed by a chemical formula:</p>
<p>SnO2+C——CO2+Sn The tin liquid flowing into the 窩子 (wozi) from the fire door separates from the carbon slag. Mineral sand that is light and fine often rises with the flame and accumulates on the roof and floor, which must be cleaned and mixed with water for smelting again.</p>
<p>The tin liquid in the 窩子 (wozi) is scooped into the提齲 (ti ju, a ladle) and cooled to a certain degree, then transferred to the pool with an iron spoon. A small 　　 (spatula) is used to scrape the tin surface to make it smooth and glossy. After it cools and solidifies, it becomes a tin sheet, commonly known as large tin. Each sheet is one chi and two cun long, five cun wide, and two and a half cun thick, weighing about 50 kilograms.</p>
<p>Our visit to the traditional method of tin production in Jianjiu is roughly like this. Most private mine owners are still sticking to the old methods, working hard silently. The Yunnan Tin Industry Company is vigorously advocating new methods, trying to use scientific methods and machines as much as possible to avoid wasting labor and to achieve large-scale production. The detailed explanations of Chief Engineer Ni and Engineer Xiong Bingxin gave us a clearer concept.</p>
<p>Aerial Cableway: Saves Time and Effort</p>
<p>First, at the Malage Mine, which belongs to the Tin Industry Company, we visited the shaft they had dug, which was designed by an American engineer named Chaper. It is more than 300 meters deep. From the shaft, they open flat tunnels. Both excavation and mining use mechanical and scientific equipment.</p>
<p>The new method is naturally much more advanced. We entered the shaft and then turned to the flat tunnel. Although the water was gurgling in the tunnel, making it cold, electric lights have been used inside, and light railways have been laid. 　 horses are responsible for transporting the waste. Human labor is already a secondary position, and the shaft is equipped with sturdy elevators, which is very convenient for going up and down. It is not as difficult and inhumane as exploring and mining with the traditional method. The most convenient and time-saving and labor-saving thing is the aerial cableway for transporting waste. It runs from the Malage Mine along Laoyin Mountain to the sand washing plant. The total horizontal distance is 22,264 chi, and the length is 22,800 chi. On that day, the reporter traveled four and a half kilometers in the air with some novelty and fear. According to the chief engineer, besides the Gejiu Tin Mine, only the Longyang Coal Mine in the Northeast uses aerial cableways for mining in China. Unexpectedly, this trend gave the reporters a rare adventure. The washing of tin ore is particularly thorough with the new method. There are ore grinding machines, classifiers, ore washing beds, return ore belts, and centrifugal pumps. The smelting furnace is built with French firebricks, which are strong and durable. In addition, there are melting pools, soda furnaces, soda pools, ore crushers, and melting furnaces. The staff of the Tin Industry Company have highly developed their abilities. Their work efficiency and research spirit are worth praising.</p>
<p>However, those sand miners who are always following the difficult road on the mine, those unsung heroes, are even more worthy of being described. The reporter has contacted many sand miners and will make a special introduction.</p>
<h3>Inside Overseas Paradise</h3>
<p>— Airmail Report from Leiden on the 7th</p>
<p>Standing in China and looking out at the ocean, one feels that the West is full of paradises. However, if one carefully considers the basic necessities of life, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, one will find that the internal situations vary from country to country. It is better to be content with one's current situation than to constantly compare oneself to others. We Chinese people can find both comfort and motivation in this.</p>
<p>The European countries that can truly satisfy people's needs are the Scandinavian Peninsula countries of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, where there is no difficulty in food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Among them, Norway is the best.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has no shortage of daily necessities, but tropical products from the South Seas are mostly no longer available. The restrictions on clothing textiles have been slightly relaxed since April. Due to foreign exchange restrictions, it is still difficult to travel freely. Housing is difficult to obtain and very cramped, and there is a shortage of coal in winter. France has enough food and clothing, and everything can be obtained if one takes the back door, but the cost of living is therefore very high. The coal shortage in the UK is unprecedented. The amount of food rations available in the market has been reduced compared to the war period. Housing is extremely scarce, taxes are very high, and prices are also high. Recently, the government has also tightened restrictions on the import of cigarettes in order to curb non-essential foreign exchange. It is rumored that in the Soviet Union, once the harvest season arrives this autumn, the bread rationing will be lifted. Housing is still extremely scarce, but the supply of coal and electricity is more abundant.</p>
<p>In Poland, the daily wage earned by each worker is only 200 波幣 (Polish currency), while a meal in a restaurant costs five times that amount.</p>
<p>In Italy, prices are 40 times higher than before the war in 1938, while the salary that the people can get is only 13 times higher.</p>
<p>In Germany, there are fewer and fewer people who work diligently because there is nothing to buy in the country. People have money but nowhere to spend it.</p>

<h3>48th International Annual Fair Tour</h3>
<p>— Airmail Report from Holland on the 8th by Hong Fu</p>
<p>Life's contradictions reveal magnificence, Heaven's intention is to turn worry into prosperity, Understanding the principles of fullness and emptiness and cause and effect, Spring rewards the exhaustion of winter.</p>
<p>Spring is like a beautiful woman looking at her face, Called upon a thousand times, it finally comes, Ice and frost have the taste of ambrosia, Clear dreams can endure bitter thoughts.</p>
<p>The above two poems were written by the reporter specifically for the 48th International Annual Fair (Jaarbeurs) in Utrecht, Holland. The "spring prosperity" in the poem reflects the bitterness of the winter cold. The annual fair reopens, and spring comes to the world. However, this year's exhibition was delayed by more than a month compared to the past. The length and severity of the ice season in 1947 were rare in a century. In late March, there was still snow and frost. The difficulties in the construction of the 48th annual fair's special expansion plan are all shown on the screen. The most impressive things are the pile-driving machine that automatically levels the venue and repairs the roads without manpower, the new construction method of completing the upper part before the lower part, the entire roof that was erected at the top of the column and then blown down by a strong wind, and the roof signs showing the completion of the construction of the venue sheds, either raising a small flag or inserting a large tree. Two weeks before the opening, people were working day and night to rush the construction, either bustling workers or brightly lit furnaces. The annual fair organizers invited domestic and foreign reporters to give a preview, showing that the more difficulties one encounters in life, the greater the achievements one will make. This beautiful analogy can be used to strengthen the spirit of self-reliance and struggle by borrowing the idea of "man can conquer nature," which is what those who are diligently engaged in business revival should take as a timely lesson.</p>
<p>Milius' Speech: Recounting the Dutch Economy</p>
<p>Before the opening, the general manager of the annual fair, Mr. J. Milius, gave a speech recounting the recent economic situation of the Netherlands. Summarizing its main points, there are five points that are worth studying for our country: (1) After the war, the number of workers in the Netherlands who help with production has decreased compared to before, while the number of people who do not contribute to production has suddenly increased. Among them, most of the girls married soldiers who were expeditioning to the South Seas and could receive alimony and did not need to work hard anymore. Some Dutch women married Canadian soldiers and have left the Dutch territory and cannot be forced to work. As a result, the number of female workers has been reduced by a large number. Of the men who could work hard, 130,000 have gone to the army, and 200,000 have been transferred to clerical jobs such as clerks and officials in new institutions such as the Daily Distribution Bureau, which were gradually added after the war due to more complicated laws. In total, the number of people who have lost their production capacity due to serving in the military and civil service has reached as many as 330,000, which has caused the number of male and female workers in the Netherlands who are beneficial to increasing production to be reduced by one-third compared to before the war. At the same time, the population of the eleven provinces of the Netherlands has suddenly increased to 9.5 trillion after the war, an increase of 8% compared to before the war. The things in the Netherlands were destroyed too much during the war, and these people's daily needs are lacking. However, the current production capacity of the Netherlands is only equal to 80% of the original production volume in 1938 before the war, and the number of people has suddenly increased sharply. The shortfall of 20% is equal to a shortage of 30%. (2) It is a very difficult problem to seek fixed wages without a sudden increase. Indeed, when prices rise, wages have to be increased, and if wages are increased at will, prices will rise with them. To prevent this malpractice, the Dutch government immediately came up with a solution, which is to have each factory rush to produce cost-effective and ordinary-quality products that are not exquisite but are specially designed for daily household needs, such as glassware or pottery, or wooden 槃榼 (pan ke, trays and boxes), and to promote mass production so that those who are poor can afford to buy them. This is a way to secretly prevent prices from rising by drawing firewood from under the cauldron.</p>
<p>Rapidly Increase Production, Hoping to Occupy Overseas Markets</p>
<p>(3) For the sake of exporting Dutch products, it is necessary to carefully measure the country's labor cost with that of foreign counterparts and seek the most favorable sector for promotion. However, Dutch businesses have been absent from the international market for five years during and after the war, and their original position has been seized by other countries. For example, the world has not seen Dutch cheese for a long time. Producers in Australia often rise up to replace them. It is not easy for Dutch products to return to their original state. Fortunately, neighboring Germany has not been able to export goods recently. Dutch businesses know the opportunity and take advantage of the time. They must catch up quickly and seize the position that Germany has in the international market. According to them, Europeans often compare the Chinese, who are good at doing business, to the Dutch from the East. If the Chinese want to gain a position in the world market, they should also take advantage of the fact that Japanese goods are not yet able to be exported in large quantities and take the lead. If they miss this opportunity, it will be too late. (4) Those who are engaged in commerce should have a fast and flexible production capacity in order to occupy more overseas markets. The Netherlands has recently been drawn into the vortex of the European war. The machines that it has always relied on for production have been damaged or lost during the war, or those that remain have become obsolete. It is not easy to compete with others in production. If a workman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools. Foreign exchange cannot be obtained in large quantities, and new and profitable machines cannot be purchased at will. Production based on simple and crude methods is slow. How easy is it to seek to increase exports and exchange foreign exchange to purchase new machines? (5) The new strategy for overseas trade is like the wool of England, the linen of Ireland, the perfumes (transliterated as Darfum) and fashions of France, the silver ornaments of Denmark, and the glass industry of Sweden. Most of them unite the national industries together and work together in the Americas. In this way, communication and publicity consume less and achieve greater results. Many 　 are easy to lift. The Netherlands is delighted and still wants to follow suit. China's financial resources are even weaker, and it cannot afford to fight alone in the siege of the crowd.</p>
<p>More Than 2,500 Participating Units</p>
<p>At the same time, visiting the venue, it is estimated that 2,514 companies from the industrial and commercial circles of foreign countries competed to participate in this year's annual fair. The area occupied has increased to 33,815 square meters, which is the grandest spectacle that has never been seen in the past 47 sessions. There are 500 companies that were missed due to late registration and full quota. In addition to the 1,380 companies in the Netherlands itself, there are also 19 countries from abroad participating in the pre-competition at the venue. Specifically, there are 268 companies from the UK, 201 from the US, 148 from Switzerland, 147 from Belgium, 137 from France, 118 from the Czech Republic, 32 from Sweden, 29 from Denmark, 20 from Italy, and the remaining from Germany, Australia, Hungary, Canada, Luxembourg, Norway, Egypt, Australia, Poland (i.e. Jewish), and Portugal, each with a few companies.</p>
<p>In the venue, the textile venue and the toy exhibition, both of which are bright and magnificent, are the best examples of the greatness of the annual fair.</p>
<p>The annual fair's "reporter" banquet was held in the Hotel Noord-Brabant, a 360-year-old store in the Northern Wilderness. The hotel is magnificent, built in the 光緒乙巳 (Guangxu Yisi) year 42 years ago. It has been well decorated and looks new. There were many witty remarks during the conversation. Mr. A. Schilp, chairman of the Dutch National Journalists Association, said that like the new Grand Theater in Luotang, which has risen to promote the prosperity of the entire city, and like the annual fair banquet, which brings together famous figures from the business community, 　 there are excellent poems from our colleagues in the press, reflecting each other's brilliance, both of which show the commonality and convergence of economy and culture. The next day, my poem and Mr. Bei's words were published in the 大應鄉 Groop Arobem Daily.</p>
<p>Visiting the Annual Fair: Like Reading a Book</p>
<p>In my opinion, visiting the annual fair is like reading an encyclopedia. The newer and more unusual of the textile 呂 (lü, textiles) is nylon, which is still woven from glass silk. It has a wide range of uses. Glass silk women's stockings have been seen in the market. The product is better than ordinary silk stockings. The sound of running is slightly excessive, and it is not easy to break through. However, you must choose to buy the one with a good brand. It is a pity that the quality of glass silk is very brittle. If you accidentally touch the corner of the suitcase near your leg when you go out, it is very easy to be scratched. Do not wear these glass silk stockings too close to the fire. For example, if you are standing by the stove in winter and suddenly stand up and go outdoors, the sudden change of hot and cold air is very likely to break the stockings. Stockings that are not worn at night should be soaked in water and dried in the morning. They will be completely dry in one hour. The newer one is Plastic, a formed substance invented in the United States. One type of formed substance that can be thinned into silk for weaving is called Cogon in English. It is dyed in different colors and is not afraid of extreme heat or cold. It is quite suitable for the subtropical China. Cogon is smooth and not subject to water or oil contamination. If it is stained with floating dust 　, it can be removed by wiping it with a damp cloth. There is also a type of formed substance called Polythene (i.e. glass ancestor). The texture is very light, as thin as paper, as soft as silk, as bright as glass, not stiff, windproof, waterproof, oil and water resistant, easy to wipe, and not subject to damage from high heat or extreme cold. It is made into raincoats or rain hats, worn over ordinary clothes and hats, without obscuring the patterns and brilliance of the clothes. Used as a tablecloth surface guard, it is like a beautiful brocade lining under a glass table, with dazzling brilliance.</p>
<p>Colorful: Expressing International Trade</p>
<p>The International Textiles monthly magazine published by 涵塘市 (Hantang City) is 36 centimeters high and 26 centimeters wide. A large row of holes is drilled at the binding on the left side, and "formed substance" spring wires, which are thick like iron wires and dyed in various colors, are passed into the holes like quick rings to form a loose-leaf book. In English, it is called Spiral binding. In Chinese, it can be called 蔦蘿本 (Niao Luo Ben, a vine book) to beautify its name. In the monthly magazine, the United Tie Manufacturers' "彩鳳自天來 (Cai Feng Zi Tian Lai, the colorful phoenix comes from heaven)" advertisement is a symbol of today's new world trade. It not only has colorful colors, expressing the ideal wonder, but also cleverly combines the legends of the gods and phoenixes in Eastern and Western civilizations. The Holland Shipong and Trading semi-monthly magazine, which promotes the beauty of the water town landscape, promotes the export business, and its charts are detailed and comparable. The women's shoe section of the annual fair is next to the textile door. Some people say that this corner is a paradise for women. Women always look at people from head to toe, and they like to beautify their shoes, which is roughly the same in China and abroad. The more beautiful Dutch women's shoes always use Swedish leather peau de 　　　 de, which is as light as silk and as fine as wool, dyed in light blue, dark blue, olive green, red, gray, and cyclamen red, which is a red with a slight blue undertone, seizing the latest colors in fashion. In Western society, women's clothing values the harmonious combination with shoes, so it is not too much for a woman to have ten pairs of new shoes. This will make the poor scholars in the countryside wonder, and as the trend progresses, a country's productivity and ideological vision must also keep up. If you know how to retreat but not how to advance, it is like seeking to be isolated from the world. There are types of 　 (suffocation due to overeating). In addition, what can be seen in the chemicals and West Leaf doors, such as the Roxane pharmaceutical factory named after a beautiful woman, makes Agre-Tonicum, a happy tonic wine, which is mostly extracted from liver essence. However, tropical plants, which have always been used to improve health and hygiene, cannot be obtained in large quantities for a while. This is truly a unique regret in the Netherlands today. The Groningen-based Pacto-pharm makes small boxed mouth fresheners to moisturize the lips and help with clear conversation, which is helpful for socializing, and its brand name is the Chinese word "崑崙 (Kunlun)," with a simple mountain in the picture, and fine dots of snow covering it. I lingered in front of their room, reluctant to leave. Someone asked me about the Chinese meaning of Kunlun, and I replied with "Groote mysterie (great mystery)." A tour of the international event is sometimes questioned, so I touch on it. (Photos by Hong Fu)</p>

<h3>American News Agency Record Concert</h3>
<p>— Liang Youyan</p>
<p>Phonograph record concerts have long been popular in the West and Japan, but in China, they are still a very new thing.</p>
<p>This concert is convenient to hold and can introduce the works and performances of world-renowned masters, both deceased and currently active. Its significance is more cultural and educational than purely entertaining. The concert prepares a program for you and explains it to you one by one. Closing your eyes and listening quietly, it feels as if you are in a grand concert. Although the sound is reproduced by machine, it still makes you feel that it is living art.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 16th, I participated in the record concert of the American News Agency. It allowed me to hear the performance of the world-famous orchestra (NBC Symphony Orchestra) and famous pieces conducted by the contemporary master Toscanini.</p>
<p>That day, pieces by three great masters, Mozart, Schubert, and others, were played, with explanations provided by Mr. Spielman of the American Embassy. Before the playing, the room was filled with Chinese and foreign music fans, but it was so quiet that even people's breathing could be heard, which demonstrated their musical understanding and passion for art.</p>
<p>What I loved most was the second part—Mozart's Concerto for Flute and Harp. I haven't been able to hear this piece for a long time. The flute is like a violin, but its sound is softer and brighter than the violin; the harp is like a piano, but it is crisper and livelier than the piano, with long-lasting reverberations. This may be because there are not many pieces for flute and harp concerto, and there are not many melodies as magnificent and brilliant as Mozart's, and it is not easy to hear harp performances in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The harp is the most primitive instrument, and due to repeated reforms, although its use is not as wide as the piano, its "status" is obviously no lower than the piano. Currently, it is not easy to find harp masters in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my country's musical "responsiveness," I cannot express how impressed I was with this program. During the intermission, I made a distorted criticism: "This piece is better than the one just now!" Unexpectedly, a foreign friend sitting next to me immediately corrected me seriously: "At most, you can only say that you like this one more. As for which of these famous pieces is better, it is impossible to make a light judgment."</p>
<p>But I was indeed fascinated by this flute and harp concerto.</p>
<p>Returning from the record concert, I only feel that we music lovers are too hungry! We are eager to have more opportunities to hear the music of famous masters and orchestras. "A fleeting moment departs this earthly realm, this regret remains long in the Huangpu River;</p>
<h3>Xuan in the Spring River</h3>
<p>— Yuan Yuan</p>
<p>"A fleeting moment departs this celebration of life, this regret remains long in the Huangpu River; tears are shed repeatedly, future generations will pay respects at the Fuchun River."</p>
<p>This is a couplet I wrote in memory of Mr. Yu Mantuo. Mr. Yu was ambushed and killed by enemy agents in Shanghai in November of the 28th year of the Republic of China. At that time, I was in Hong Kong, and the bad news arrived during a typhoon, with violent winds and rain, and the sky as dark as night. Later, at the public memorial service in Shanghai, I sent this couplet. It wasn't until the late spring of the 36th year of the Republic of China, eight years later, that I had the opportunity to pay my respects at the Fuchun River. The scenery of the Fuchun River is still so beautiful, but the Songjun Villa by the Fuchun River no longer has the splendor of the pavilions of the past. Broken walls and tiles depict the scars of war. The owner of this Songjun Villa was Mr. Yu Mantuo. His younger brother, Dafu, also died in a foreign country in this war. Returning to the old place, how could I not repeatedly shed tears?</p>
<p>Originally, my so-called repeatedly shedding tears was just a saying. At that time, Guangfu had already died in Kunming, and then I received the news of Mantuo's death. To repeatedly shed tears was nothing more than for my old father and for Mantuo. Unexpectedly, on this trip back to Zhejiang, I would also have to shed tears for Dafu. The green mountains remain, the clear waters flow forever, but the people we knew so well are no longer here. Looking at the clear river water, looking at the quiet Crane Mountain, how can I not be moved to tears?</p>
<p>The people of Fuyang, to commemorate these two Mr. Yus, built a cenotaph for Mantuo at the foot of Mount Yu on the 16th of last month, and also built a memorial碑 for Dafu. Originally, Dafu had his own reasons to be commemorated. The establishment of this monument only expresses the people of Fuyang's remembrance and respect for Dafu. As for Mr. Mantuo's noble character and dedication to the country, his sacrifice in this national war is indeed a heroic story that will be passed down for thousands of years. Now that the people of Dangyang have held a public funeral for Mantuo, the traitors who murdered Mr. Yu have not yet been brought to justice. Looking at the new tomb at the foot of Mount Yu, how can we not be filled with emotion again?</p>
<p>Before his death, Baotuo had a close friendship with Mr. Zhang Xingyan. At that time, Mr. Xingyan planned a trip to Liaoshen, and Baotuo wrote a poem to send him off. I can't remember the whole poem, but the first few sentences are still deeply imprinted in my mind: "In old age, relying on others, striving to be strong, expecting to recognize the charred tong wood after leaving; knowing that the elders can discuss state affairs," Since the people publicly buried Mantuo on Crane Mountain, Mr. Xingyan deeply remembered their old friendship and wrote the inscription for the cenotaph. With words of boat-like wisdom, and mountains and rivers as long-lasting as life, I imagine that when Mr. Xingyan put pen to paper, he must have been filled with emotions and shed tears, weeping together for the country and the nation.</p>
<h3>"The Past"—A Sad Reflection</h3>
<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>Although it is still spring chill, peach blossoms still bloom all over the branches. After a spring rain, the garden is as refreshing as if it has been showered. The red flowers and green leaves are even more charming. Sparrows and birds have all perked up their tongues. With the spring breeze, the peach blossoms are listening attentively, but cannot help but shed a few pink tears, as if regretting that this rich and colorful spring scenery will be quietly buried along with the cold air!</p>
<p>On Weideman Road, a group of young men and women are strolling and enjoying the spring scenery, with a wisp of annoying spring feeling in their hearts.</p>
<p>Ten years of deep impressions stirred up sad reflections in her mind again: short, ten-year-old shadows!</p>
<p>She and Xin were happily touring a private cemetery. They walked over the small stone bridge in the garden. The stream flowed slowly, and roses and lilacs exuded a intoxicating fragrance. Winding around a small stone mountain, they saw the standing stone tablet in front of them. A beautiful girl's portrait was embedded on the tablet. Two long braids hung down from her shoulders to her chest. Her affectionate eyes showed the melancholy she was forced into by her environment from between her delicate eyebrows. Her name was engraved on the stone tablet, along with her life story. Qiu Li, who entered a convent at the young age of ten, recited the Bible with the nuns every day or prayed. After a short half-year, she died of acute meningitis. After reading the epitaph, she couldn't help but feel a surge of sadness in her heart. She didn't understand why this little child was sent to a monastery.</p>
<p>She pondered silently, unable to find an answer. Xin挽ed Miao's arm, left the stone tablet, and walked over the small stone bridge. The roses and lilacs still exuded a strange fragrance, and the water in the stream still flowed slowly and quietly. The little birds in the flowers flapped their feathers and flew back into the lush forest.</p>
<p>The old man guarding the cemetery came towards the garden with a long bamboo pipe in his mouth. She asked him to tell the story of Qiu Li. The old man thought for a while, and then murmured:</p>
<p>"Qiu Li's mother was a famous and talented woman, but she fell in love with a young man and gave birth to Qiu Li. Because she was not tolerated by her family, she was driven out. Her love with the young man was somehow cut off, and later she drifted to a bird island and finally committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The abandoned Qiu Li was led by a nun, so she became a saint in the convent..."</p>
<p>Ah! Child! It turned out that she was bearing the cross for her parents, imprisoning her innocent and lively heart, and imprisoning her in a quiet and deep courtyard.</p>
<p>After listening to the old man's narration, she leaned sadly against Xin, as if sobbing.</p>
<p>However, after ten years of trauma and torture to that sensitive and sentimental heart, she 重游 old place today, and one grass and one of the cemetery is no longer looking for traces of the past. Beside the rubble trampled by the enemy,缘茵 and wildflowers have covered the surroundings. She gazed at the blue sky after the rain and took a long breath: "The Past" is just a deep dream!</p>
<h3>Madonna and Child</h3>
<p>The Madonna and Child is a representative ivory carving work from the late 13th century. Most carvings of mothers and children are seated, but this work makes use of the shape of the ivory to create a standing statue. The carving is delicate, and the expression is particularly good. The crown, hair, and lace of the cloak are all covered with gold, and the crown is inlaid with colorful gemstones and pearls. Except for the muscular parts, which are ivory in color, the rest are dyed in light colors, which is calm, elegant, and very unique. It is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. The French regard it as a "national treasure." (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 513</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Hello!" He hoped that this call was from Li Ming or Shouyi, he could use the conversation to create an objective condition. But unfortunately, the call was in Japanese, from Zheng Yan, and the tone was very nervous and anxious. As a result, He Jian's existing feelings were immediately transferred to another front.</p>
<p>This phone call took a considerable amount of time. Under the questions and answers, He Jian hurriedly grabbed paper and pen and carefully wrote down some notes. The content of the phone call was also quite complicated. Zheng Yan used various hidden words and various everyday topics to explain the complicated news in detail; and told He Jian that he still had to wait for other news and could not get away for a while.</p>
<p>Based on the key points recorded by He Jian, there are three main points:</p>
<p>First, according to the news received by "〇十二" in Tokyo, as decided by the General Staff Headquarters military conference, Hasegawa Kiyoshi has been officially promoted to Commander of the Navy for the invasion of the mainland. His two major fleets, the 10th and 11th, including the 5th Torpedo Squadron, and the frontline 10th Seaplane Squadron, etc., have all been fired up and prepared, waiting only for Konoe to sign the departure order. It is expected that before dawn the next day, they will march mightily to the economic heart of China, with the final goal of a "treaty under the city" in Nanjing!</p>
<p>Second, Matsui Iwane has been appointed Commander of the Expeditionary Force. His first instruction is based on the "Secret of Eight" plan, ordering the "latent" and "overt" military offensives in the Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Wuhan areas to be launched simultaneously at the auspicious time of "dawn" on August 1st (mainland time), limiting the occupation range of the predetermined plan within two weeks, forcing the "current Central Government of China" to yield!</p>
<p>Third, Kenji Doihara, who calls himself "Lawrence of Arabia," the spy mastermind of the orchid organization, is dissatisfied with the current Japanese spy network organization, so he contacted Isogu Kensuke, one of the military brain trust, and Torataro Kisaka, the head of the Oriental Executive Department of the Black Dragon Society, to jointly petition the General Staff Headquarters and Konoe, intending to reorganize the spy agency. He said that as long as the General Staff Headquarters approves this proposal, he has the ability to carry out a general liquidation in the entire spy organization; using intimidation and assassination as weapons to achieve his goal of unifying the organization.</p>
<p>The first two pieces of news clearly indicate that the flames of war between China and Japan are imminent. He Jian has always been responsible for eliminating this war. Now, this great disaster has become a reality with a 99% certainty. It goes without saying that he feels extremely guilty that all his efforts have been in vain. The third item, in particular, is a personal terror; if Doihara really achieves the goal of reorganization, the first to be crushed will naturally be He Jian himself and his secret organization. In other words, from now on, it will be impossible for him to continue to operate as before, using the communication mechanism for various counter-espionage activities. Not only that, Doihara may have some awareness of his activities, at least, He Jian is a thorn in his side; this "liquidation" move may not be a fatal bomb aimed at He Jian. In this way, not only will He Jian's career be wiped out, but even his life will be in Doihara's hands. Even Pingzi's unexplained disappearance in Shanghai this time may not be a warning issued by the enemy.</p>
<h3>Water Shadow</h3>
<p>— Youqin</p>
<p>When you lower your head and see your reflection in the clear stream, what thoughts do you have? The clear sky, white clouds, and the inverted images of mountains and tree branches set off your clear face. Do you feel lonely? Mysterious? A leisurely poetic flavor? A serene philosophical meaning? Please tell me!</p>
<p>"People do not look at themselves in flowing water, but in still water." Of course, water cannot show you a clear face when it is flowing, and at the same time, your heart cannot be still, so you naturally cannot see yourself and all the things that set off your appearance.</p>
<p>Poets are accustomed to using phrases such as autumn water eyes. The eyes observe the water, the water observes the heart. If the water is clear, the eyes are clear, and the heart is clear, then everything is clear. Conversely, if there is turbidity, then everything is turbid; if there is an obstacle, then everything is obstructed.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I read Aesop's Fables: A dog walked across a bridge with a piece of meat in its mouth. Seeing another dog in the water also holding a piece of meat in its mouth, it became greedy and barked loudly. Unfortunately, the meat in its own mouth was also lost because of this. This dog's eyes were not obstructed, and the water under the bridge was also clear, but unfortunately the dog's heart was turbid. As a result, both the eyes and the water lost their function. The real became an illusion, and the illusion became a fork in the road. What does the dog know? How could it not feel regret after barking?</p>
<p>When people choose horses, they often say, "You need to keep your eyes open!" In fact, what's the use of just having bright eyes! The sharper the eyes, the more one cannot help but be one's own master. There seem to be very few people in this world who can be described as "the door of the minister is like a market, the heart of the minister is like water." The so-called "like water" is of course like clear water. Only when it is truly "as clear as water" can one see things and see the heart. Otherwise, one will inevitably be like the dog in Aesop's fable seeing the reflection of meat.</p>
<p>The Shurangama Sutra says, "The Moonlight Child said, I remember in the past, there was a Buddha named Water Heaven, who taught the Bodhisattvas to practice water contemplation and enter samadhi. At that time, I first achieved this contemplation, but only saw the water and did not see my body. I once practiced meditation in a Bhikkhu's room. My disciple peeked into the room through the window and only saw clear water everywhere in the room, and saw nothing else. The child was ignorant and took a tile and threw it into the water, making a splashing sound, looked around, and left. After I came out of meditation, I suddenly felt a pain in my heart. At that time, the child came forward and said the above thing. I then said, if you see the water again, you can immediately remove the tile. The child obeyed the teaching. Later, when he entered meditation, he opened the door and removed it. I came out of meditation again, and my body was as before."</p>
<p>We are not meditating monks and have not practiced "water contemplation," but we cannot put any pebbles in the heart water, just as we cannot put any dust in the eyes. Throwing tiles into the water is like throwing them into the heart. We must ask the child who threw the stone pebbles to immediately open the door and remove the pebbles. "The one who tied the bell must untie it." Only in this way can we make "the body as before."</p>
<p>I don't understand any Buddhist principles, nor do I have any intention of studying Buddhism, but when I see water, I observe my heart through water. I hope that when I look at my reflection, no child will throw tiles into the water, disrupting my clear face, as well as the clear sky, white clouds, mountain peaks, tree branches, and other signs that set it off, so that I can clearly see myself.</p>
<p>"Where is not me when I lower my head? All four directions share this sky in the water." Su Zizhan's line of poetry is worth savoring after all.</p>
<h3>Woodpecker Chapter</h3>
<p>— Mengnong</p>
<p>"Sharp claws and strong beak, busy pecking under the setting sun. Though the forest is nearly exhausted, what harm is it to have an empty belly? Small in shape passing the locust alley, loud voice near the thatched hall, how can it be like swallows and sparrows, only knowing how to occupy the sorghum." - "Compendium of Materia Medica".</p>
<p>April is here, and you, the doctor of the forest, are here too, bringing the sound of pecking!</p>
<p>Listen! The whole forest is filled with the sound of pecking! Although I don't know where you are, I do know that wherever the trees are, that is where the footsteps of you, the lovely doctor of the forest, have reached.</p>
<p>By the sound of pecking, I can trace your figure: the red hair on your majestic head, the dark green tail feathers, the peach-colored face, the hooked long claws, the needle-like tip of your tongue. Most vivid and moving is that you often reveal your bright red crotch, or spread your dark green wings, constantly and repeatedly making the sound of pecking, like a monotonous drumbeat, but in fact it is heavy, clear, and refreshing!</p>
<p>Tell me, you mysterious doctor of the forest! How are you endowed with the power of music, pecking, pecking, in the middle of the dense forest, in the middle of the dead wood, so monotonous, but so heavy, clear and refreshing? Did you fly down from the top of "Mount Buzhou"? Did you fly down from the "Country of Suiming"? Did you drift out from the "City of the Sun and Moon"?</p>
<p>These imaginations are not hanging in the air. I see the ancient historical records, which have already written a reliable biography for you thousands of years ago. "Lushi" says: "At the top of Buzhou, there is Yicheng, where the sun and moon fire do not reach, and there is no distinction between day and night. There was a sage who traveled to the City of the Sun and Moon and arrived in Nan锤. There is a base, and the bird pecks its branches, then it spontaneously ignites. The sage was inspired by this, so he looked up at the star-shaped heart and took it to make fire, making drills and changing fire with five kinds of wood." In this way, I imagine that you may be the guide of Suiren; no, you may be the incarnation of Suiren? Although I saw in an old ancient myth called "Shi Yi Ji" the "Country of Suiming" that "does not know day and night," it is said that there is Suimu there, and birds peck its branches, and fire flashes out from the branches. It is also said that a sage, inspired by the bird, began to imitate it and discovered the method of making fire from hammer wood, which became the origin of the historically famous Suiren. But this is, after all, a myth. How can I regard myths as credible history? Although you are not a god, you are a concrete existence. I have personally seen your reality, heard your pecking sound, and appreciated your work!</p>
<p>Your monotonous yet clear and refreshing pecking sound evokes my yearning for another god in Greek mythology. Perhaps he is your dear foreign brother, his name is Prometheus. It is said that for the survival of mankind, he did not hesitate to challenge the heavenly emperor and boldly became a fire thief, bringing fire from heaven to the earth, to the poor human world, and thus suffered a harsh sentence that was both unprecedented in heaven and rare on earth. He was finally struck on a desolate rock, and his precious flesh and blood were fed to greedy, numb, insidious, and vile livestock! These magnificent and tragic pictures are all transformed into their original forms by your clear pecking sound.</p>
<p>Your pecking sound may be a cry full of compassion and kindness. Are you afraid of hurting the good trees in the world! Are you not afraid of fatigue as you fly around the forest? Oh! Are you looking for the trees that are already or easily infested with insects? In the blink of an eye, those trees that are already or easily infested are detected by your keen vision, hearing, and smell. Only then do you use your long tongue, strong claws, and sharp beak to hook out the insects, not even letting go of the stubborn larvae. In the sound of pecking, no pests can hide. From this, we can see your true kindness and see the sacred action you are performing like Prometheus!</p>
<p>At the same time, you also possess the same magnificent spirit as Prometheus. When you have pecked out all the insects in one place, you flap your wings and fly away—flying outside the mountains, or flying to the other side of the sea. In order to peck out all the insects in the world, you have no fixed abode and no time to warm your seat. You just wander everywhere, wander, wander. Therefore, your pecking sound keeps buzzing and echoing everywhere!</p>
<p>The pecking sound echoes at the edge of the sky, echoes at the corner of the sea, echoes on the mountain peaks, echoes on the treetops, and at the same time, echoes in my heart and echoes at the tip of my pen.</p>
<p>"Peck, peck"... "Peck, peck"...</p>
<p>Monotonous yet clear and refreshing sound!</p>
<h3>Starting from the Prosecutor's Extortion</h3>
<p>— Xuzhou</p>
<p>Luo, a prosecutor of the Yongjia Local Court, recently colluded with his wife's younger brother to extort a set of wooden furniture, a watch, a congratulatory banner, and more than three million yuan in cash from the criminal Qu Yushu, before approving bail and release. The title of the news report was "Knowing the Law and Breaking the Law." In fact, how could a court prosecutor be merely a law-knower? A judicial officer who breaks the law is customarily subject to a higher penalty.</p>
<p>There are many stories about corruption in history. It is said that the late Yuan Dynasty was the era when the wind of corruption prevailed. According to Mr. Wu Han's research, this was because the Mongolian Semu people were muddled and did not understand what "honesty" meant at all. Therefore, at that time, there were particularly many reasons for demanding money; when high officials took office, the lower-level officials had to pay "greeting money" when they met them, and "flower money" was demanded for no reason at all, "festival money" was given on festivals, "birthday money" was given on birthdays, "routine money" was given for managing affairs, "human relationship money" was given for sending off and welcoming, "departure money" was given for servants to arrest people, and "official business money" was given for going to the government to file a lawsuit. With so many reasons for demanding money, the common people all became the fishy smell on the mouths of corrupt officials. It is said that in the past, palace maids in the imperial palace inevitably stole men. A stout man would often be made skinny and eventually be driven out. The weak man who was driven out was seen by ordinary people as "medicine residue"—the medicine was eaten by the ladies, and the medicine residue was also dumped out. Similarly, the common people in the eyes of corrupt officials are by no means human beings with all five sense organs and four limbs, but only purses. If you squeeze them, you may be able to dig out a few big coins. Although there are many reasons for demanding money in hell, I wonder if you must pay "bail money" when a criminal is released on bail? If so, then the extortion by Yongjia Prosecutor Luo is imitating the story of the Mongolian Semu people at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, alas!</p>

<h3>How Many Women Are Losing Their Chance to Marry</h3>
<p>— Ye Run</p>
<p>Recently, I attended an alumni association meeting and we talked about many old times. Principal Guang Sheng asked the alumni to fill out a form, which included a section for marital status. As a result, it was discovered that among our graduating class, only two-fifths were married. We have been out of school for ten years, and our average age is over thirty.</p>
<p>Why are there so many women losing their chance to marry? Having received higher education is certainly one reason. Among our group of middle school classmates, some went on to receive university or specialized education. These people have a narrower range when choosing a spouse, and because the period of higher education is longer, they also delay some time. However, most classmates returned home after graduating from middle school, or entered the business world. The marriage prospects for these people should be broader, but the result is the same difficulty.</p>
<p>The responsibility for losing the chance to marry certainly does not lie with the women themselves. They do not have overly high standards. At the same time, in terms of their talent, appearance, character, they do not have to worry about not being pursued. The problem seems to lie with the men. In the ten years since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the life of displacement and turmoil has made men afraid to marry. In the midst of war and chaos, even those already married are inevitably separated, let alone adding the burden of a family. This is in terms of the environment.</p>
<p>As for the economic aspect, the impact is even greater. From the mid-stage of the Anti-Japanese War until now, prices have continued to rise, making life increasingly difficult. If a young man does not have a particularly good income, he can only take care of himself and does not have the capital to start a family. This situation is particularly obvious in Shanghai. Not to mention anything else, just the issue of housing is enough to make a young man lose the courage to marry. If he wants to marry, he must live separately from his parents and find (at least) one room. Finding a room now is so difficult, not to mention decoration and furniture.</p>
<p>"With the Japanese devils not yet defeated, how can we have a home?" This kind of mentality was unavoidable during the Anti-Japanese War, and should have disappeared after the victory, but some young people hold to the principle that "with a career yet to be established, how can we have a home?" Still others lost their education during the Anti-Japanese War and now need to make it up, which also makes them reluctant to marry. These mentalities, combined with the above-mentioned economic and environmental reasons, have caused young men to delay marriage, delaying the best years of many sisters. Is this loss borne only by the sisters? I'm afraid not. Furthermore, should modern young people succumb to the above-mentioned reasons and just put marriage on hold? What are the advantages and disadvantages of putting it on hold like this? The author hopes that people who care about social issues will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Heartless Fallen Flowers</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Young man A: I stood under my girlfriend's window, singing beautiful songs, asking her to marry me. So she threw down a bouquet of flowers.</p>
<p>Young man B: Then how did you get a bump on your head?</p>
<p>Young man A: She forgot to take the flowers out of the vase.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Various Cold Drinks</h3>
<p>— Zhong Li</p>
<p>Iced coffee was first created by the Abyssinians. They roasted coffee beans, coarsely ground them into powder, brewed them into a drink, and added ice that was stored for half a year, thus creating the first iced coffee. It was not until the 12th century that the Arabs learned this method, and it took the English another three hundred years.</p>
<p>According to Marco Polo's "Book of Marvels", written in 1275 during the Yuan Dynasty, he ate frozen cakes in China.</p>
<p>Iced chocolate was first invented by the Mexicans, several centuries before the Spanish forcibly invaded Mexico in the 16th century.</p>
<p>Iced water became a cooling product for wealthy Romans in the middle of the 1st century, but they did not know how to make ice. They only built huge ice cellars to store it.</p>

<h3>Looking at Society from Suicides</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Department announced the suicide cases for April, among which the vast majority were due to financial difficulties, accounting for 26%. If we expand the two reasons for suicide, family disputes and illness, to include the item of financial difficulties (because many families do indeed have disputes due to financial difficulties, and illness is undoubtedly mostly caused by economic poverty), then the proportion of suicides also expands to 67% (see the local news column of various newspapers on the 17th). What a terrible social phenomenon this is!</p>
<p>This statistic tells us a second point to note, which is that most suicides are young people, with those aged 19 to 29 accounting for 46%. The third noteworthy point is that most suicides are educated. Combining secondary education and elementary education, suicides among the educated account for 56%.</p>
<p>What does this statistic illustrate? In a word: it is the current unemployment problem of educated youth, and it is a rather serious problem. This is also confirmed by the results of the Shanghai Employment Agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs regarding the registration and introduction of unemployed youth.</p>
<p>Life is the only value in life. Everything else arises from the value of life, so suicide is by no means what people want. But when life is impossible to struggle, life not only loses its meaning, but also loses its motivation. Even if you don't commit suicide, you will be killed. The difference is only a short distance in time. Strictly speaking, those who die of hunger and cold, and those who die prematurely due to malnutrition, are also a kind of suicide, only chronic, invisible, and bloodless.</p>
<p>We have said that life is the most precious; and the life of young people, especially the life of educated young people, is even more precious. Today, young people are destroying their most precious lives, and the pain is naturally incomparable, and the sadness is unimaginable. This is not only the loss of Zhang San and Li Si's lives, but also a disaster for society and the nation. Because for a young educated person in their twenties or thirties, society has invisibly shouldered a considerable burden for their education. Now that they are dead, from the perspective of society, it is equivalent to a completely losing business deal. If this business deal continues to lose money, then the merchant will have to go bankrupt completely!</p>
<p>The large number of suicides among educated youth shows on the one hand that the society is in a slump, leaving young people with no way to make a living; on the other hand, it shows that Chinese education is bankrupt, and young students cannot stand on their own feet in society. To tell the truth, the current educated youth, they can neither pull a cart nor carry a load on their shoulders. Speaking of technology, they have no special skills. In this way, to avoid unemployment, they must have special personal connections.</p>
<p>Today, the path of educated youth is very narrow. Our demand for struggle and opening up a path cannot be achieved by empty words of insisting on struggle. Society should be stable, and education should be improved. Most importantly, we must not become unproductive vagrants, but must be hard-working bees. With work, there will be a livelihood, and it is hoped to improve the livelihood, so that suicide can be reduced.</p>
<h3>Remembering Sheng Xuanhuai</h3>
<p>— Ban Shuai</p>
<p>Sheng Xuanhuai was the most corrupt official of the late Qing Dynasty. He spent lavishly during his lifetime, and after his death, he left tens of millions to his descendants, which was shocking at the time. It is said that Sheng was promoted by Li Hongzhang, which is true, but the reason why Sheng was able to be in such a lucrative position and supervise the national railways was not so much due to Li's power, but to Zhang Zhidong's power. (Wang Yanglu details the matter.) After the Sino-Japanese War, the prestige of Li Hongzhang was greatly diminished, and it was fashionable for the court and the public to attack the Li faction. Sheng, as Li's confidant, was attacked even more vigorously. Therefore, there was an imperial decree to remove him from Tianjin Railway and order the ministers of the Northern and Southern Oceans to investigate and report. At that time, Wang Wenshao was the minister of the Northern Ocean and secretly shielded Sheng, wanting to exonerate him, so he ordered Sheng to visit Zhang Zhidong to plead for mercy. At that time, Zhang was the minister of the Southern Ocean. When Sheng arrived in Hubei, he was just about to stammer out his request when Zhang stopped him. The next day, he showed Sheng two draft memorials, one impeaching him and the other recommending him. Sheng asked what he meant. Zhang replied, "If you can take over the Hubei Railway Bureau for me, I will protect you." After Zhang urged Sheng to take over the Railway Administration Bureau, he spent six million taels of silver but achieved nothing. The capital severely blamed him, and Zhang was quite hesitant. Knowing that Sheng was good at planning and was rich in capital, he intended to let him advance funds to take over. Sheng immediately agreed, but asked Zhang to guarantee that he would also be in charge of the railway, so that he could control it nearby, so that the iron produced by the bureau could have a market. Zhang had no choice but to agree. In a month, Zhang and Wang Wenshao jointly submitted a memorial, not only clearing him of the past, but also guaranteeing him to be the superintendent of national railways and also the director of the factory. The Qing court was indeed ignorant, and Rong Lu and others accepted huge bribes, which is why Sheng later dared to act arbitrarily and unscrupulously.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Famous Songs</h3>
<p>— Ke Di</p>
<p>The Last Tears (Last Tears)</p>
<p>"The Last Tears" is an excellent and very famous lyrical song. It has not only become a popular folk song in Bohemia (now called the Czech Republic), but it is also a famous song that is often sung by vocalists. The composer is a famous "dramatic soprano", Madame Destinn.</p>
<p>The content of this song tells the story of a pair of lovers: they foresee that their love is about to end, so in a dim dawn, when he bids farewell in front of his lover's door, he tells her that this tragic day is about to come, and then silently leaves with tears in his eyes. This last tear is forever remembered in her heart.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the song, a melody similar to a chorus is used, showing the fear of a pair of lovers when the sad day comes, which is very touching. He relives many sweet past events in song: the joy of dancing together, the first words of love, and the beloved daughter they have born and all the happiness. At the end, an sad and moving melody is used, slowly and suppressively to end, which makes people can't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>Toreador Song (Toreador Song)</p>
<p>The great French opera composer Bizet has a world-famous and beloved opera, which is the magnificent "Carmen", and the "Toreador Song" that I am introducing here is the most famous aria sung by the male baritone in the second act of "Carmen" when Dureidor is in the inn. At that time, the heroine Carmen was singing and dancing wildly with her Gypsy friends in the inn. Dureidor came, and in their cheers, he used this particularly famous aria to tell them about the emotions and state of surprise and danger during bullfighting.</p>

<h3>Art and Literary Scene</h3>
<p>The famous cartoonist "Ox Nose" creator Huang Yao, during the Anti-Japanese War, moved to the inland and traveled all over the southwest. After the victory, he lived in Vietnam. Last autumn, he took his collection of art treasures to Paris for exhibition. On his return to Haiphong, he encountered the French-Vietnamese War. His works over the years were all burned. Recently, he escaped and returned to China. He completed his first five-color comic "Collection of Contradictions" and "Vietnamese Scenery" in Kunming, which were publicly exhibited locally. In late April, Mr. Huang was invited by friends to arrive in Guangzhou, intending to stay for a short time and publicly exhibit his works. (Huang Tangqing)</p>
<p>Zhang Zhougui, the author of "Bai Fu Poetry Collection", is the original author of the film drama "Grand Hotel". The poems in the collection such as "Son of the Sand Han", "Swallow", "Waiting", "Ode to the Divine Comedy", "Water", "Confession" and other works are all rare masterpieces; now it has been published by Shanghai Jiangwu. Poetry lovers are welcome to purchase at No. 203, Tuanmingyuan Road. Also, Bai Fujun's literary novel "Troubles in the Desert" has been sent to press and is being printed in a hurry.</p>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>The 22nd issue of Guang Magazine, May issue, edited by Huang Jiayin, has now been published. The content includes Feng Yuxiang's autobiography sequel "My Anti-Japanese War Life", Hai Ge talks about the Universe Wind and Lin Hanlu Song Muzhi's novel Falling Cave, Professor Wang Chengzuzu's Northeast Travel Sketch, Shen Jifu's view of the Sichuan bandit situation from the defeat and demise of the commander's bandits, etc.</p>
<p>"Shangshi" decided to stage the three-act seven-scene myth drama "Chang'e" written by Wu Zuguang and directed by Yuan Jun at the Lyceum Theater starting from the 20th of this month. The actors include Lv En as Chang'e, Zhang Fa as Hou Yi, He Lu as Feng Meng, Xia Tian as Wu Gang, Qian Qianli as the Old Man Under the Moon, and Zhu Jiang and Wang Ping as Chang'e's parents, etc. There are more than 20 people. The play is very realistic, poetic and picturesque, the tone is extremely beautiful, and the meaning is also extremely profound. It is a new style of performance.</p>

<p>The Soviet science fairy tale, "The Adventures of the Insect World", has been published by Kaiming.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi's Salary</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>When Guang Sheng Hu Shi talked about the problem of professor treatment (this newspaper's Beiping telegram on the 7th), he said that his salary was "recently adjusted and increased to more than one million, but converted into US dollars, it is only more than thirty dollars;" and jokingly said, "I might as well teach in the United States." For a famous scholar to say such a ridiculous thing, it shows the plight of the lives of professors today.</p>
<p>In fact, from professors to elementary school teachers, the life difficulties encountered by everyone are the same. Those with "ways" are changing careers one after another. Those who can go abroad are of course a small minority. Most of them are just making a circle in their own country. The work efficiency of these people in other positions is not difficult to imagine; but how can we prevent those people from changing careers?</p>
<h3>Solitary Wanderings</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Someone said, "Life is bird song, flowers, flowing water, and floating clouds, just eight words." If asked again, he would say, "Flowing water and floating clouds, should be bird song and flowers, just eight words."</p>
<p>These few words are thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Life is desolate.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said, "Heaven and earth are unkind, treating all things as straw dogs."</p>
<p>Tolstoy said, "Life itself is a tragedy."</p>
<p>Legend has it that Lao Tzu went west out of Hangu Pass and his whereabouts are unknown. This ending, like flowing water and floating clouds, seems to unfold a picture of the twilight spirit of Jiangtian for us, its beauty is like poetry.</p>
<p>Tolstoy regarded the honors of his own world, the so-called warm family, as just memories that brought him incomparable pain. Therefore, this white-bearded old man ran away from home. He probably wanted to find something he had not gotten in eighty years, but what exactly was that? Perhaps this great thinker of the century also found it difficult to say. Finally, this giant died lonely in a hotel.</p>
<p>Banqiao said, it is rare to be confused in life. Those who are mired in deep thinking cannot be content with fate.</p>
<p>Integrity and happiness are often two enemies that refuse to coexist. I envy happiness for being able to lie safely on the sofa of worldliness; soft bone disease does not affect its comfort.</p>
<p>Integrity, on the other hand, has sharp edges and corners, and because it cannot conform, it cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, "evolution" continues, I think integrity will inevitably be defeated by happiness, one by one, the heart is solid and the body is fat. The society and the world are all fat people, and there is no need to have the trouble of organizing a fat people's association.</p>
<p>At that time, foreign houses and foreign houses will inevitably increase in price, because there is no considerable thickness, and there is no appearance of anger to enter.</p>
