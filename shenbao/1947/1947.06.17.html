<p>〔合衆社北平十六日電〕天津當局今日正式承認，接　政府命令，實行封鎖塘沽至上海一綫，其範圍包括河北省，山東及江蘇海岸在內，此項措施，衆信目的在防止載運接濟品及兵員之大帆船自大連流入山東。據非官方消息稱：大連爲對國軍搗亂之兵站，因共軍以該地爲補給兵站，足以派援軍阻擾國軍重行打開津浦路之希望。另息：天津市公用局，曾接奉海軍當局之通知，準備停泊碼頭，供中國軍艦之用，中國最近曾自美國獲有九艘掃雷艦。同時天津形勢緊張，軍隊乘軍用卡車巡邏於街道之上，並在去年建築之街角工事中，首次駐守衛兵，工人在該市南面開掘戰壕，自晚十時起之宵禁，今日已進入第三日，雖有此種軍事狀態之表現，然一致認爲，天津與北平仍可安全無虞。</p>

<p>〔本報天津十六日電〕北寗綫津唐段軍糧城附近，昨晚有煤車一列觸雷，列車十四節出軌，下午四時修復通車，平津綫龍　鐵橋一度修復，因載軍力不足，正加修中，平津各次列車，仍在豆張莊換車接運。</p>

<h3>永泰艦血案</h3>
<p>自葫蘆島返青途中　一艦務官槍傷艦長</p>
<p>〔本報青島十六日電〕北巡第一艦隊永泰軍艦，於北巡返青途中，艦上發生槍擊艦長殺人流血慘劇。今日由關係方面透露，該艦於八日下午駛經葫蘆島，又登海面　門島時，艦上新任艦務官季銳　出手槍，在官　中對衆轟擊，先將原任艦務官鄭家　擊斃，旋向艦長黎玉　開槍，黎腿部中兩槍，傷勢無礙。此外通訊官呂狄亞右手中彈，擊去兩指。另勤務兵一名腿部輕傷，季銳連發七槍後彈罄，乃縱登駕駛台驅走值班輪　手，取信號槍自殺，惟彈力不足，僅傷右頰，季遂再縱入海中　自盡，被艦上救起後神經緊張，咒語不絕。現該艦已駛青，受傷人員已入院醫治，兇手季銳送軍法處審訊，季銳與死者係同學，季於本年三月到差，原爲接替死者職務。季平時沈默寡言，神經似不正常。</p>
<h3>我政府所提抗議　蘇蒙作間接答覆　莫斯科昨廣播外蒙聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕蘇蒙雙方對我新疆事件所提抗議，除於廣播中作間接答覆外，迄未有覆文寄來。各報記者連日至外部探詢，所得答覆僅爲：「本部迄未接獲任何覆文」，對我是否將再提抗議事，則拒絕有所披露。另據政府某高級官員談，當局對新事正鄭重處理中，是否再提抗議，亦正研究中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十六日電〕莫斯科電台廣播蒙古人民共和國外交部之聲明稱：「蒙古邊疆守軍乃因華軍越入蒙古境內，遂被迫在飛機掩護之下，加以擊退」。該電台繼否認華方所傳進攻中國疆界之說，並斥諸爲捏造之言，顯有挑撥性之作用。</p>
<p>據該電台廣播六月五日事件之真相稱：「中國軍隊一分遣隊，違犯蒙古人民共和國疆界，在梅爾丁戈爾河（譯音）一帶邊境，佈置十六公里長之陣地，掘設壕溝，並在襲擊蒙古邊疆哨兵站時，調軍增援，蒙古邊防軍司令曾派員往會華軍司令，要求其退出蒙古，但遭拒絕，使者並被其扣押，因此蒙古邊防軍遂被迫採取擊退侵犯者之措施。邊防軍分遣一隊乃在蒙古空軍飛機數架掩護之下，迫使進犯者退出蒙古人民共和國之境。蒙古邊防軍在採取此軍事行動時，並未越入中國境內，華軍撤退後，乃在六月九日在華軍營地內發現蒙古軍使者及邊防軍士兵四人之屍體，身上皆有嚴刑拷打之傷痕。蒙古人民共和國遂向中國政府提出強硬抗議，並保留要求中國政府嚴懲罪犯乃賠償蒙古所受損失之權利。」</p>
<h3>莫斯科廣播　與事實不符</h3>
<p>承化北塔山皆我國土</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕據此間接獲莫斯科廣播，外蒙方面將此次新疆事件起因諉之於我軍越過外蒙邊境，記者以此詢諸關係方面，承談：不論就歷史言，地理言，條約言，承化及北塔山東北地區，皆屬我國幅員之內，莫斯科廣播，全與事實不符。</p>
<h3>中蒙劃界問題　或在蘇京談判</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十六日電〕據此間官方預測，中國與外蒙人民共和國，對於最近發生衝突之新疆北部劃界問題，將面臨一持久不快之外交爭執。莫斯科電台廣播引證外蒙外交部長之聲明稱：中國軍隊在六月五日越過蒙古境，此項言論預示關於新疆邊境劃界問題，將經過多次複雜之談判。其談判地點或許在莫斯科。中國堅持發生衝突之北塔山在中國境內二百哩，而外蒙方面，據悉則稱中國邊境應移至北塔山之南。該處傳有煤，金及鈾等礦藏，皆極豐富。官方關於外蒙之要求，如莫斯科廣播中所言者，頗感不安。據渠等指出，在以往，外蒙仍視爲中國之一部分時，根據中國方面之新疆省界，北塔山在中國境內二百哩。又據官方稱：外蒙尚未向中國駐莫斯科大使館提出此項要求。其原因雖則中國承認外蒙人民共和國之獨立，但尚未建立外交關係，因此任何有關此事之談判，須由中蒙兩國外交代表於莫斯科進行之。惟中國官方預示，在未來邊境談判中，中國政府將堅持一九四〇年（承認外蒙獨立前六年）內政部所發行地圖上之原有界綫。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕滬市青年建設協社籌備會，爲新省事件，上電蔣主席，略稱：「外蒙率爾稱兵，凡我黃夏，無不髮指，請速予蕩平，以安邦國」。</p>
<h3>麥斯武德主新　各方期望甚殷</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕新疆省政府改組後，新主席麥斯武德，業於上月二十八日宣誓就職，際茲外蒙古侵新之時，各方對麥氏之期望異常深切。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕國民黨總理廣州蒙難紀念會及中央黨部紀念週，十六日晨九時在該部大禮堂合併舉行，蔣總裁領導行禮後，即由邵力子委員講演，邵氏追述總理於民十一年今日在廣州蒙難之前後事實，及蒙難前半年在桂林之軍人精神敎育講演，認爲總理一生之言行，完全一致，在革命過程中，雖累經挫折，卒能以此種大智，大仁，大勇之精神，獲得成功，總裁繼續領導革命，亦以此種精神昭示吾人，相信　後之困難，亦必能克服也。</p>

<h3>王外長致開幕詞　迅速恢復經濟為和平勝利條件　中國願協助遠東經濟委會成功</h3>
<p>沃文先生，各位代表：</p>
<p>亞洲及遠東經濟委員會，是聯合國一個重要的機構，本人今日得一機會來此講話，覺得很榮幸，因為在中國開這種性質的會議，這還是第一次。</p>
<p>本人首先要代表中國政府，歡迎各位的到臨，本人並且保證中國政府將盡力協助各位，我想到會諸位的一致的志願，必然是要使這個委員會的重大任務完滿完成。中國政府樂於看到這個志願的實現，自不待言。</p>
<p>這個委員會的創立，係申去年十二月會理事會各次決議所產生，這些決議中有一個決議，委託本委員會「發動並參預各種措施，俾能容易集中力量，以利便亞洲及遠東經濟的重建，以提高亞洲及遠東經濟活動的水準，以維持並加强本區城內各份子間的關係，以及本區域與世界各國的關係」。</p>
<p>由此看來，這個委員會的任務，範圍很廣闊，却也十分明白，各位的責任，至為重大，各位所要處理的問題並且十分急迫。當各位在此地討論議事程序和工作計劃之時，有流離失所的億兆羣衆，在注視着各位如何設計，如何決定，各位是絕不會辜負他們的，因為有了他們的犧牲，我們纔得到戰爭的勝利，也唯有獲得他們的擁護，我們纔能得到和平的勝利，而經濟的迅速恢復，是和平勝利的條件。</p>
<p>自從盟國戰勝日本一年十個月的時間，已經過去了，世界經濟恢復的曙光還是不曾出現如果全世界的情形是如此，亞洲和遠東尤其是如此。</p>
<p>講到　國，本人極想坦白一說：我們還在受着通貨膨脹和物價波動的嚴重成脅，和戰爭期中一樣，我們殘破的城市，和殘破的農鄉，都還沒有發動重建工作，我們僅有的交通綫還沒有大恢復，我們的一切生產能力都還沒有提高。</p>
<p>中國經濟恢復的遲延，實在有多種的原因，在這許多原因之中，戰災區域的廣大是主要的原因，經濟復員工作所需的努力和時間，大半都由此而定。情形曁然如此，所以我們共同敵人所給予中國的傷痕，至今還在流血不止。聯合國的基本任務，在促進國際和平與安全，至於促進世界和平之道，聯合國的憲章，已經明白承認在剏造良好的經濟狀况。諸位先生，假使世界的和平與世界的經濟安定，是不可分離的，那麼，侮一個遭受戰災國家的政治安定，也必然是與經濟復興的工作不可分離的，這兩事是互為因果的，這兩事是必須同時並進的，現在中國的境內已有衆多的區域，不但急切的需要經濟復興工作，而且可能實施這種工作，在亞洲及遠東其他國家也有同樣情形，這些區域的經濟復興工作，不可使他們等候到他們全國政治狀况恢復常態，而後着手。</p>
<p>〔被戰災區域經濟重建臨時分組委員會」所派出的「亞洲及遠東工作組」，曾經發表意見，認為世界經濟狀况的恢復，必須由一切有關政府通力合作，這是極老實而正確的見解。上次世界大戰的勝利，不是一個風家的力量所能造成的，一個國家想把自己境界封鎖起來。去單獨享受經濟的安定，也是同樣的不可能的，所以我們必須結合起來，妥定方案，並使定下來的方案，見諸實行。</p>
<p>中國方面，準備協助這個委員會的一切調查工作，我們期望這個委員會皆幕被災各區穴出臨時救急的方案，並且定出長期重建的方案，中國定亦儘量貢獻，竭力協作，使委員會達到眞正的成功，我們要使這個委員曾有利於亞洲，遠東，乃至全世界各民族，並且由此而提高聯合國本身的權威。</p>
<p>本人期望並且相信這個委員會必能善盡其責任，聯合國的工作覺錄上·將必因是而加上薪新和最重要的一頁。</p>

<h3>活文致開會詞</h3>
<p>沃文致開會詞稱：亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會在亞洲召集第一次會議，本人深覺此次會議在歷史上之重要性。本人奉聯合國機構秘書長賴依氏之命，特向各國代表致意。查此次會議所檢討之各項問題，皆有關全球半數以上人民之戰後經濟復與，本會當前之主要問題，係研究亞洲各國如何得恢復戰前之經濟元氣，故在檢討各種方案時，似不宜使研究之範圍過於廣泛，徒浪費精神而不能收實際之效果。本委員會倘能依各問題之重要性為考核之標準，則在短時期內不難樹立切實之方案，而使各方面皆能公認本會係以實際作工為前題之團體。</p>
<h3>推選主席　一幕爭論　蘇代表異見無人附議</h3>
<p>昨日上午大會按議程第二項規定推選主席時，首由印度代表奈魯提名蔣廷敵博士為第一任主席，渠並發言，謂：「蔣博士對我們當前工作，旣具經騐，而其忠吿和指導，確將帮助我們建立堅强和奏效的組織，如果我們接受其領導，將使我們的任務輕易良多」。</p>
<p>然蘇聯代表史迭辛柯於奈氏言畢即表示異議。渠稱：本人提訋，選羅主席應在各國代表致詞完畢後，始可確定何人担任。蘇聯代表團於昨日（即指前日）下午始到滬，對於主席人選尚無充分時間考慮，故要求暫緩選舉。</p>
<p>但美代表戴維斯則表示贊同尼羅氏提名，渠除贊同印代表之推畢蔣廷議外，更對蔣氏之具有非常資格來担任此職一點，有詳細說明。</p>
<p>合維斯嗣畢，史且辛可仍堅持該項選舉須暫緩舉行，反復陳述其意見。其時時問已逾十二時，臨時主席沃文即宣佈下午三時繼續討論。</p>
<p>下午會議開始後，主席報吿大會主席已有印代表提名，美代表附議。正將付表決時，史氏又發言，堅持各國代表先致詞，再選舉。後由非代表瓜德諾提議討論終止，即經主席將史氏建議提付表決，但無人附議。主席宣佈蔣廷黻博士任大會生席，然後退於主席位左座，由蔣氏正式入席。</p>
<h3>蘇聯代表　異見獨多</h3>
<p>大會於昨日下午蔣廷散主席致開會詞後開始討論第三項關於臨時議事規則。英代表克羅建議交委員會研究審查後再提大會通過。此時史迭辛科民又謂：本人對於英代表建議並不反對。但對於第四項「推選大會職員」，主張不應似先前推選主席時之匆促草率，應有時間考慮，故又建議暫緩討論。</p>
<p>至討論第四項時，史氏乃再度提出先行演說然後討論之主張。渠並以氣憤情緒詢主席曰：蘇聯代表是否與其他代表有同等權利，對提案可表示意見？伯議案究應由何人來決定？應請主席解釋。</p>
<p>主席即笑曰：本人決無意決定任何議案，身為會議主席，本人之責任即欲使任何一代表不感到有所損失。史氏即稱：本人及本國代表團為推選主席事，確已受到損失矣！</p>
<p>復對於推選大會職員一項，因若十代表亦提議於今日（十七日）討論，同時時間已屆五時許，故由主席宣吿明日上午繼續會議，並詢各代表以何時為合適？是否定於十時開會？而史氏則主張十時半舉行。乃即決定今晨十時半開會。</p>

<h3>經濟問題不解決　政治困難必增加　蔣廷黻當選主席後發表演說</h3>
<p>蔣廷敞氏昨於被選為遠東經濟委會大會主席後，特向各國代表致謝意。並發表演說如次：</p>
<p>在本年三月三日，亞洲及遠東工作團主席經濟理事會主席提具一份分析精細之報吿書，亞洲及遠東經濟委員會即根據此報吿而產生。當時此報吿書雖未能包羅詐細之情報，然其觀點確能切實了解亞洲及遠東之各種經濟間題。更主要者，即該報吿書中曾指出亞洲及遠東之經濟病態，在戰爭以前已甚顯著。該報吿書中所提之數點，今日實有一讀之價值。例如該報吿書中曾云：「我人必需水認亞洲及遠東的復興，不應單以狹製的恢復戰前狀態為前題，在大戰以前，亞洲的工業發展祗是表面化的修飾，此粉飾外表仍隱藏了陳舊的社會組織，在各地雖有新型的工廠，鑛，及現代化的都市，鐵道與機塲，然一般人民仍在極度窮困及愚蠶情形下求生存。因此在亞洲各地就產生了所謂「雙重式」的經濟機構，在此機構中，一部份人民從事現代化的生產，而大多數人民仍用非工業化的方式爭取生存」。</p>
<p>該報告書中又指出「亞洲及遠東各種生產及貿易之政進，實為提高全世界生活水準之大前題，倘世界各國能協助亞洲復興，則其生產力及消耗力當有益於全球各國之復興。該報吿所指各點，實足予吾人以檢討之根據。依本人之觀察，亞洲若干區域內之政治情形，實為經濟復興之最大阻力。然政治上之紛爭，若考其因果，實為外表上之問題。政治紛爭之主要起因，仍是人民及國家之窮困，在饑餓窮困之情形下，政治上之安定當難以實現。亞洲一般人民對政治思想及主義大都不表關切，彼等之全要現實間題，是「衣食住」，普通民衆對政治主義的興趣，大都基於「衣，食，住」三項間題上。因此，經濟問題倘無解決之方法，則政治困難必因之而增加。目前亞洲及遠東各地工業生產，雖遠不及其他各地，然現代化的生產方式，已給予亞洲人民一種新啓示，工業革命在亞洲各地已在發動中，各國政府雖能盡力推動此工業革命，然本委員會倘籠及時協助，則更能加速此工業復興。</p>
<p>在過去中國社會中，居　袖地位者皆係所謂智識階級。二千年來，此文士隨級大都全部脫離了現實之生產及留易問題，而貫注全力於研究文學。因此，中國之文士階級雖樹立了偉大的文學·藝術，及哲學·而對農業，工業·鑛業·經濟·金融等問題，皆無實際之貢獻。近數十年來，中國之智識階級已逐步放棄了單純的文士生涯，而謀解決當前之現實間題。此現象實可稱為歷史上之一大革命。同時，在社會關係方面，近年來中國人民亦取得一種新的觀念，在經濟制度方面，目前中國已採取混合的經濟制度，使國營事業與商營事業在和衷共濟情形下同時生存。此種混合的經濟制度，在目前情形下是必需的。若干工業如鐵道·電力·軍器製造等，皆需政府投資，以補私人資金之不足。中國採取國營商營混合經濟制度，其另一主要原因，係使大最天然的資源不為少數人操縱。</p>
<p>本委員會雖不參與實際復興工作，然我人之工作及建議，將影響全球半數以上之人民。此次大會實係有歷史性的工作。</p>
<h3>粵各地水災嚴重　百萬人無家可歸　桂省連雨災象已成</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十六日電〕粵各地因　雨為災，洪潦暴發，所有東西北江之防潦基圍，泰半崩缺，其餘亦無不危在旦夕，鄉民均日夜鳴鑼搶救。十五日起雖已放晴，惟除東江水微退外，西北兩江仍有漲無退。估計無家可歸之災民，近達百萬，農民性蓄損失更屬無從估計。行轅張主任張發奎，省府主席羅卓英，對災情均甚關切，連日召集有關機關商討，經決定由善救分署撥　米三百餘噸作急賑之用。張主任對災後地方治安尤為注意。至粵漢路英德　江兩大橋被沖崩後，路局速日均派大批員工積極搶修，杜局長鎭遠曾親赴工地督修，限令本月二十日全部修復通車。</p>
<p>〔本報桂林十六日電〕桂境全省述日大雨，沿河各縣汪洋一片，水災已成，災民不可以數計，各公路橋樑均被洪水衝斷，交通梗阻，無法運輸賑。品受災各縣，態勢至為嚴重。又桂林近流行傷寒症，患者頗衆。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>美批准歐洲四國和約</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統於一昨簽署義羅匈保四國和約之批准書，並發表聲明：其關於義大利和約之聲明，有謂：『該約之若干款，並不與吾人之意志完全相符，今後可能視需要情形，經由聯合國機構，予以更改。對義和約之批准，使義美關係中不愉快的一章，已為之結束：同時，義大利已進入新時代，使其人民得以期望而信任的心情，向前瞻望。……值此義大利人民在逆境下重建其民主，恢復其自由之際，美國得站於義大利之一邊深感愉快，美國人民決繼續援助義人。』但對於羅匈保，杜魯門總統措辭就不同了：『本人以為必須對些三國政府之不顧大多數民意並從事壓制民意，公開表示遺憾。自些三國獲得解放，並由三强成立雅爾達協議以來，余卽希望眞正代表人民之政府得在該三國成立；但時至今日，此等政府猶未存在。……』由於是項和約批准書之簽署，終止了美國對義羅匈保四國的戰爭狀態，美國對義羅匈保四國的作戰，至是吿一終結。</p>
<p>如今對義羅匈保的和約是成立了：但不幸的是和約的成立，未必就是和平的獰致。歐洲纔停止了世界第二次大戰的砲火，然而火藥氣味卻又籠罩在整個歐洲。我們不用提戰後的德國；可是我們所應該提出的，就是假使令出現在單後德國的局勢長此拖延下去，此其結果，無疑地必將抵消了此次作戰所得的戰果。拖延是不利的：拖延之所以造成，表示一方之無政策，另一方之有計劃：拖延就是他們的計劃。在美總統簽署四國和約批准書的時候，我們又同時看見有英首相艾德里的演說：表示任何未來的戰爭，不僅為個人生與死的問題，乃整個文化生與死的問題：此一演說雖為擁護聯合國機構而發，但其意義至為深長；而其更值得我們細細玩味的卻就是正當杜魯門總統在四國和約批准書上簽署的時候，英國首相乃有此項警告性的演說發表。這也許可以說是對和約的本身是一種諷刺。和約剛剛簽署，而未來的戰爭郤又作為政治家演說的題材；這不可算為諷刺，又是什麼？</p>
<p>實在出現在歐洲的局勢是太動盪了，鬥爭是太尖銳了。匈牙利的政變，形成了親蘇政權的產生，在羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，局勢亦不能長此下去：强隣的脅迫，羅保暹早必有親蘇政的產生，變成了眞正的附庸國家。羅馬尼亞前曾一度醞釀過政變，其所以未有進一步事態的表現者，大約就因為匈牙利的有事。觀乎最近有所謂巴爾幹聯邦的計議，則整個巴爾幹均將有席捲而去的危險。誠然，在目今的形勢下，所謂巴爾幹聯邦多少具有一種神經戰的作用：其目　以在抵消杜魯門主義及其對希士的援助。然而　我們於此要提高世人警覺的郤是此種呼聲的提出，與其說是神經戰衝，無寗說是力的試探。它　關鍵，端在杜魯門總統此後對於歐洲的政策如何　是否准備作力的較量。對於匈牙利局勢，亦正是具有同一意義的試探。如今親蘇政權是在匈牙利成立了，英美關於匈牙利局勢的照會也被蘇聯拒絕了。英美此後對匈局勢所採取的步驟，關係實在重要。倘使沒有力的表現，則整個巴爾幹，乃至整個歐洲的前途，實在可慮。</p>
<p>這是為此，我們所以看見杜魯門總統對於戰後的義大利頻頻寄予秋波。他在簽署了四國和約後，對於義大和所作的聲明，態度婉轉，情意濃厚：與所作對羅匈保的聲明判然有別。在整個東歐幾為蘇聯席捲以去的　日，義大利已為西歐的前衛。美國的國防綫如今已不在大西洋，已不在萊茵，而已伸展到亞德里的海，向東引伸到愛琴海以東。為了囉保此　防綫，美國必得爭取義大利，再不能讓義大利變為第二波蘭。所以在簽署對義和約批准書的時候，杜魯門總統就表示此一和約可視需要情形，經由聯合風機構，予以更改。然而緊接着對義和約戰立之後的却是現實政治問題。在對義和約生　後九十日內，英國駐義軍隊將全部撤離，英義兩國且已就此事成立協定，於一昨換文。我們所引以為慮的，就是義大利自身的軍備旣極可憐：美國駐軍徹離以後，局勢尤難控制。狄托旣虎視耽耽窺伺於後，而孫聯在歐陸又保有强大的軍備。義大利又將何以自處呢？</p>
<p>要之，由於此次四國和約批准書的簽署，美國對義羅匈保的戰爭狀態雖吿終止；但與和平的獲致還有相當的距離。我們還看不見有和平的遠景，這頂多只能說是停戰。在經過這次創巨痛深的戰爭，如何而能使世界的和平重建起來，是則有望於各國政治家的善為努力。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾援歐計劃　將面臨重要考驗　匈國政變造成困難局勢　該計劃與杜魯門主義間似有矛盾</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕蘇聯於本週末正式拒絕美國對蘇聯在匈政策之抗議，以及英國要求獲取此事之情報，已再度造成蘇聯與西方國家閒之緊張局勢。而馬歇爾國務卿援歐「大陸計劃」之政治作用，不久即當交付考騐。馬歇爾計劃與杜魯門主義間之主要衝突點，即為前者之主張使蘇聯及東歐國家亦包括在其大陸計劃之範圍內，而杜魯門主義則主張決不以美元支持共產政府，此項衝突迄猶未曾正式呈現於公衆之前。然匈牙利局勢之發展，以及蘇聯之　然無意放棄在中國東歐之勢力，已使前項衝突不能再子忽視。蘇聯對匈牙利之局勢如保持堅決態度，則美國之經濟援助，若非不顧受害者之政治趨勢一律供給，即為對蘇聯勢力圈內之國不予供給。故未解決的問題，乃為馬歇爾之經濟援助建議，是否附有政治條件。匈牙利盟管會蘇聯主席史維里杜夫將軍答美國抗議書之覆文，以及莫斯科所發表蘇外長莫洛托夫與英大使彼得森會談之公報，顯示蘇聯對於英美之懷疑匈牙利之政變陰謀為一製造事件，仍覺憤然。此兩文件復顯示蘇聯將繼續不許其他佔領理國獲知引起匈前總理那基等辭職之證件。有謂蘇外長莫洛托夫可能已知照英使彼得森，表示對蘇聯之立塲將有若千修正，然迄至目前為止，外交部尚未接獲報吿，可蹬莫各托夫曾於上週五首先要求與英使再作晤談。而最近蘇聯之聲明，係於前項傳說發生後廿四小時以上始行發表，可證前說如屬確實，亦不致使蘇聯之立塲有基本上之變更。預料貝文外相於下星期二在巴黎與法外長皮杜爾所談之主要問題，將為美國之援助建議可能附有政治條件之問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕今日據悉，國務卿馬歇爾及其高級顧問現已訂定應付歐洲混亂與共產主義變重成脅之方案，或在本年底前統一歐陸大部份，或不待蘇聯反響，使之較昔分裂更甚。據外交官員聲稱，蘇聯如果堅決拒絕合作，無疑將迫令西歐單獨親成一種經濟聯邦，意即蘇聯及其東部國家集團將被剝奪美國之切實援助。聞馬歇爾希望此事不致發生，蘇聯終當合作，至少可允許其統治各國中一部份與美國建議合作，而組成某種歐洲經濟聯邦。馬氏政策顯乃一種歡迎蘇聯合作之「門戶開放」政策，門戶倘若關閉，則必出於蘇方。但此問認為蘇聯關閉該一門戶之可能性極大，自昨在副國務卿艾克遜之演詞中，頗可窺見。</p>
<h3>英外相今日飛法　商討歐洲經濟復興問題　英政府將徴詢蘇聯意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十六日廣播：貝文定明日飛赴巴黎，與皮杜爾討論馬歇爾所提出之復興歐洲整個計劃。同時貝文並聲明將與蘇聯就同一問題進行談判，但華方已表示不惑興趣。共黨機關報「眞理報」著論抨擊馬歇爾主張，謂此僅係美國擴展杜魯門主義之一種手段而已。</p>
<p>〔聯合社偷敦十六日電〕外交部發言人今日宣稱：關於美國務卿馬歇爾接歐計劉，英國即將直接徵詢蘇聯意見。初步接觸將遵循正常外交途徑。外長貝文現赴巴黎在明日商談美國復興歐洲方案，但是否撥親赴莫斯科，則無所聞。又法國已向蘇聯徵詢關於美國援歐計劃之意見。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：英國下議院定於十九日辯論外交政策，屆時將以英國對馬歇爾國務卿之歐洲合作計劃所當特何種態度一層作為辯論之主題。前任外相艾登亦將出席，代表反對派發言。此間政界人士現偕密切注意外相貝文所當發表之演說，蓋屆時貝文外相已與法國總理賴瑪迪埃與外長皮杜爾進行會談，故必具有重要意義也。此外衆人預料殖民大臣瓊斯亦有重要演說發表，闡明英國對非洲屬領。尤其是黃金海岸與尼日利亞等地之發展方針。此外，德國問題亦將提出辯論，以證實英國官方避免與蘇聯對此陷入僵局之傾向云。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統　定明日廣播</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處本埠訊〕美風呼聲電台將於六月十八日（星期三上海夏委時刻下午六時半至七時）廣播杜魯門總統對普林斯頓大學畢業班之演辭，屆時總統將接受該大學名譽法學博士之學位。總統之演辭代替「美國圓桌會議」之經常英語節目，可由下列各電台收聰：週率一五二五〇，一五一五〇·一一七九〇，一一七三〇，九六五〇，九四九〇。</p>
<h3>美對外援助　惠及五十九國</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕據亨納在「華盛頓星報」撰文稱：自對日勝利日以來，美國對外經濟與技術上之援助，受惠之國家有五十九國。渠之調查，說明，美國在協助重建戰後破碎世界計劃中所化費之金錢在二百億美元以上。亨納列舉進出口銀行之對華貸款幾達八千三百萬美元，及對勝利日以後之租借物資約值七億美元，其他以剩餘物資及聯總之收濟品，亦有數百萬獎元。亨納並列舉國會所批准對菲律賓共和國之特別協助六億九千五百萬美元，其中付與私人戰爭損失之要求計四億美元。</p>
<h3>美蘇戰爭可避免　傑克森氏之觀察</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐罕爾州漢諾伐十六日電〕美國最高法院法官即前紐倫　法庭檢察長傑克森，昨夜向達特茅塞大學生發表演說稱，蘇聯欲竭力避免與美國發生戰爭，若謂戰事不可避免，則全係錯誤之倫。今兩國之磨擦，殆由於雙方皆欲擴張勢力範圍所致。</p>
<h3>蘇電台廣播眞理報評論　指責美對歐政策　謂馬歇爾計劃實即杜魯門主義</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十六日電〕關於美國援歐計劃，莫斯科電台廣播眞理報之評論稱：「馬歇爾之計劃雖似新奇，實則僅為杜魯門以美元援助他國而復取政治厯力干涉其內政政策之重複。美國在任何如匈牙利之國家肅淸其內部之陰謀後，必有此等呌囂，馬歇爾之計劃，在字面上故意使其不同於杜魯門主義者，無非欲掩蔽人之耳目而已」。莫斯科之廣播：「六月十二日馬歇爾在記者招待會曾謂渠之歐洲經濟復興計劃乃指全部之歐洲各國包括蘇聯，英國與其他歐洲等國，然此顯然與美國對東歐政策相矛盾。其目的無非欺騙美國人民曰，美國計劃原係一視同仁者，然蘇聯與東歐各國自己不願接受美國「援助」之條件耳。馬歇爾計劃之眞諦，乃公開贊同邱吉爾所發動之歐洲聯邦。一切無非證明美國「援助」政策之意義，並木改變。」</p>
<h3>蘇如欲攫取中東油田　美將訴諸戰爭　華萊士在記者招待會上談稱</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕華萊士十五日招待記者時談稱：蘇聯之擴展如達到可以攫得沙地阿拉伯油田之地步，則英美「應」訴諸戰爭。稍後，華氏復謂：渠之言論恐有誤解為「好戰」之處，故將英美「應」訴諸戰爭一語，改為「將」訴諸戰爭。華萊士指中土耳其為列强「棋局」中之「將」，蘇聯應知迄中土耳其為止，蘇聯不能再前進而不引起戰爭。美國海軍將保衛沙地阿拉伯之油田而戰。渠認為蘇聯目前之西疆如再予擴展，則蘇聯殊屬「不智」。有人間以蘇聯是否「攫取」匃牙利，華萊士嗤之以鼻，且稱：如謂蘇聯擬「攫取」匃牙利，則亦可謂美國藉杜魯門之援希計劃，而擬「攫取」希臘云。</p>
<h3>菲致力擴軍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺十六日電〕菲列濱共和國之成立已屆一週，視正努力企圖將美國訓練之少量軍隊，擴充成儒堅强之武力。</p>
<h3>歐洲將舉行圓桌會議　討論美援歐方案　蘇聯反響如何關係重大</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十五日電〕此間外交界頃預料，歐洲國家或將於下月內根據馬歇爾之美國援歐計劃而討論經濟合作辦法。爭於利用美國建議之歐洲國家，或將於七月間舉行圓桌會議，其理由係根據下列二項迅速發展：（一）貝文外長曾宣稱，渠將於十七日乘機飛赴巴黎，與賴瑪迪總理及皮杜爾外長作初步討論，或將勾留二日。（二）法國邀請蘇聯交換美國計劃之意見。蘇聯對於此項計劃之反響有重大關係，倫敦外交界認為美蘇對於巴爾幹之發展雖有爭執，但蘇聯或將接受馬歇爾之計劃。史達林曾數度吿人稱：渠將歡迎美國之經濟援助。據稱：蘇聯如接受馬歇爾之建議，則杜魯門主義在歐洲方面之應用將自動取消云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯覆牒反唇相議　美政府碍難接受　匈人士感覺驚異與不安</h3>
<p>〔法國際聞社華盛頓十六日電〕闕務院發言人頃宣稱：　至昨夜十一時為止，盟國管利匈牙利委員會美代表維姆斯，倘未接到籌制會主席即蘇聯斯維里杜去將軍拒絕調查匈牙利政情之復照。華盛頓方面富然亦未收到，自難加以評論。半官方面則稱，照會內容倘與報紙所傳無異，則美國碍難加以接受。蘇聯鼓勵匈牙利新共派政客菲法　權，反而指責美國包庇垮台政府人員，將玩火自焚，　美國一向贊成公正選　之匈牙利　　故也。他日聯合國調查委員會若果成立。蘇聯將被迫提出被控參加陰謀者之證件。要之此事微妙，最後　動途徑，　杜魯門總統或鄧歇爾國務卿始能決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社憲　佩斯十五日電〕美國指責蘇聯干涉匈內政之照會，以及盟管會主席蘇聯史維里杜夫將軍之　文公布後，匈人之反響可別為驚異及不安等兩類。所感驚異者乃史維里杜夫將軍所稱匈國民議會已一致對新政府通過信任票之語，蓋事實上並尚未有此等表決。而就反對黨領袖上週之言論觀、表決之際，殆亦難望一致支持。匈人所感不安者，乃美國照會所稱「如不獲滿意答覆，吾人將採其他行動」之語。同時匈司法部長李斯已令檢察署對匈前總理那基國民議會議長代爾迦向人民法庭提起控訴，此舉與匈國法律原則相背，蓋匃法律規定總理在職時之行動，祗能由國　委員會審判也。</p>
<h3>奧總統表示　決維護民主</h3>
<p>〔合衆社維也納十六日電〕奧總統倫納爾稱：奧民主政治　　，非受外國支持之政治　進　所能推翻，惟吳總統承認，奧國之共黨懷有遠大計劃，但渠等祇能獲得由選舉中應得之權力云。</p>
<h3>蘇覆牒內容　拒絕英美建議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社匈京十五日電〕關於美國於本月十一日照會盟國管制匈牙利委會主席即蘇代表斯維里杜夫將軍，要求組織英美蘇三國委會調查匈政局一事，頃悉斯維里杜夫業於本日函復美代表繼姆斯將軍，對於美國之要求斷然予以拒絕。其覆函略謂：余並不以為匈牙利最近所發生之事件中，有遵反雅爾達協定之處，貴國之抗議實全無事實根據，故余不得不予以拒絕。　國所謂蘇千涉匈內政，亦係向壁虛構，職是之故，余對於貴國所提由英美蘇三國聯合調查匈政局一項建議，礦難接受，且不認為有此必要，余以為此舉將千涉匈內政，難以容許。匈牙利最近之政變，乃前任總理拒不注意內閣之意見所致，目下肢潮已由匈議會依照憲法之程序予以解決，議會且已表示信任新政府，並已擾以全權，凡此種種事實，當為貴閱所深知，殆無疑義，貴國最近所提出之照會，以協助匈民主政治為名，實則企圖協助若干曾參與陰謀者發生關係之人士，乃為無可諱言者。關於審訊匈小地主黨書記長柯伐克斯之紀錄文件，余亦並不認為余有將此等文件轉致英美駐匈代表之義務，此等文件業已送交匈政府，蓋因其僅與匈政府有關故也云。</p>
<h3>德境英美當局准許開放　德國進出口業務　蘇佔領區將成立常設經濟委會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十五日電〕德境英美軍政府已客許開放德國之進出口商業，俾經濟上合併之英美佔領區得自給自足。美軍當局宣布在上週內曾成立三項重要協議，另一談判定於本週開始，俾德國可於一九五〇年出口二十億美元之貨物。在一九五〇年之前，此項目標殆不能達到，蓋先需向許多國家輸入原料。進口業務則已在順利開始中。上週中成立協議者計有：（一）瑞士代表團已與英美區代表於十一日在拍林簽訂出口協議，規定瑞士進口商可至英美佔領區直接與德國出口商進行談判，（二）英美當局已批准一千三百十七萬美元之巴伐利亞出口計劃，計鉛筆六百萬元，玩具五百萬元，X光及牙醫用具二百萬元。（三）英美已在原則上成立協議，組織處理進口，供給款項及購買美國棉花及紡識品之機構。義大利商業代表國將於本週內赴柏林與英美當局開始談判。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十五日電〕德國通訊社本日刋載蘇聯佔領軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基元帥所簽署之命令，宣佈蘇聯軍政府業已將其在經濟方面之行政權移父蘇聯佔領區之德國中央事務局。按該局以前僅以顧問資格提供意見。索柯洛夫斯基元帥之命令親定組織一常設經濟委員會，由德國中央行政機構之實業局，運輸局，燃料局，電力局，農業局，商務局及糧食局各局長，蘇聯佔領區各工會領袖及「農民救憤機構」之首長組織而成。據觀察家稱，蘇聯此項行動係與英美佔領當局新近設立經濟委員會及執行委員一事類似者。</p>
<h3>美東海岸海員　二十萬人怠工　各大港口運輸均告停止</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十六日電〕美國東海岸海運工人廿萬名十六日在船上實行怠工，故美國各大海港口岸之運輸已吿停止。目前之海運合同已於十五日午夜滿期，全美海員工會在其他四個「工組」工會支持下領導「無合同無工作」運動。在岸工人已不再上船，在船工人已停止工作。工會之戰術擬迫使資方將海員自船上逐下，造成資方解僱工人之休業。工會方面極力避免使用「罷工」一字，據工會領袖之估計，此舉將影響各地船隻約一千艘，首當其衝為紐約一地，據海關方面稱：紐約現有美船二百二十艘，其中一百另二艘在修理中。全美海員工會會長科蘭十六日上午一點廿分分別致電各地分會，指示「不可簽署合同，不可開駛船雙”但所有海員應儘可能留在船中，此電週用於各租用外國沿岸及各洲閒之船隻」。工會談判委員會已奉命，若資方堅持拒絕考慮任何工資，工作時間，及工作條件之改善，則拒絕延長現行合同。西海岸海運工會現已單獨與西海岸資方進行談判，但申君若東海岸工會不能獲得勝利，彼等亦將怠工云。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十六日電〕據盟軍總部人員稱，一俟今秋盟總之漁設重建計劃獲得實現，”本漁船隊將有大型木質捕魚船八百廿一艘，大型曳綱漁船五十九艘，及小型曳綱漁船九百卅三艘，此數字較其戰前之漁船隊尤大。</p>
<h3>美對韓共黨姑息政策　李承晚深表不滿　韓獨立黨內部意見紛歧</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十六日廣播：韓國領袖李承晚今向報界發表談話稱：韓國祇有一條途徑可謀出路，韓國必須成立百份之百的民主政府，否則可建立純粹之共黨政權。任何由若干共黨參加之「雜碎」政府，決不能或功。混合委員會所能做到者，僅為一種妥協，即使目前之妥協，百份之九十係順從美方之意見，而蘇方之意見僅佔百份之十，但韓國南部最後必為共黨所控制。韓人並未分治，造成分治者，實為美國之政策。美國在國內執行肅情共黨政策，但在韓國，則對共黨採取姑息政策，宣屬不智。</p>
<p>〔新亞社漢城十六日電〕近日南韓各政治團體之活動愈為緊張複雜。左右派合作委員會及其他之十餘國體之代表金奎植·呂運亨·安在鴻·洪命喜等，昨今兩日曾討論參加美蘇聯合委員會問題。在民主主義戰綫旗幟下之各代表，亦曾討論諮詢表格之內容。韓國獨立黨內部，對此已分為兩派，革新派主張參加，委員長副委員長等人之態度迄未表明云，</p>

<h3>印本哲布省　定期試行分治　國大黨否認藩邦獨立權</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社拉霍爾十五日電〕本哲布省雖已商定分治之初步協定，但此間星期日仍曾發生縱火事件十數起。據悉：本哲布省所成立之分治初步協定，規定由　盟與印度敎徒及錫克族將該省劃為東西兩部，試行日期已定於本哲布省議會開會後之次日即六月廿四日。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里十五日電〕全印國大黨委員會今日一致通過通大黨執委會之決議案，否認任何印度藩邦有自行宣布獨立，與印度其他各部脫離關係之權。並表示不希望印度蓬邦之統治者，認淸國家之現在局勢，為其邦內及全印人民之利益而加入印度聯邦。尼赫魯於辯論時，並表示任何外國承認印度藩邦之獨立者，將被視為不友好之行動。</p>
<h3>英軍官訓練法軍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社阿爾及爾十五日電〕英軍一隊計軍官十四人，與下級軍官及士兵八十八人，由巴洛中校率領，應法政府之邀，今日飛坐英艦抵此，敎導法軍使用英國軍備，並訓練法國空運部隊。</p>
<h3>印尼荷蘭間糾紛　將請第三國仲裁</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十五日電〕印尼共和國經濟部長蓋尼談稱：印尼將請第三國仲裁印尼與荷蘭間之談判，此畢係林牙蒂協定前後一款之規定而採取。吾人仍準備為之利益，努力使該一協定獲得和平解決。蓋尼並未第三國為何國，若干人士相信英國或將再度被請協助解決印尼之困難。蓋尼並稱；荷蘭與印尼雙方於簽訂林牙蒂協定時，均知此乃一基本協定，荷蘭之建議及印尼之對案均為對該協定各自之解釋而已。荷官方對於印尼對案雖尚未有反響，然非正式方面則指印尼之反備忘錄為不能施行。</p>
<h3>盟國對日政策　即將正式確定　美擬保留委任盟軍統帥之權</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕據權威方面消息，遠東委員會於十九日舉行會議時，將通過戰後對日政策之「基本決策」。基本決策乃十一國委員國長期討論結果，實際上不過將杜魯門總統所宣佈之「美國對日政策」加以修正而已，其目的在於永遠解除日本之軍備，推行自由與民主，懲戒戰犯，恢復和平時期之經濟活動，處理賠款及軍政府經由日政府之行政方式。遠東委員會之決策除重申上述目的外，並將重新肯定美國戰後對日政策中一節，即駐日盟軍統帥應為美國委任之另一單位。美國若千官員認為此節頗宜子以保留，蓋麥帥之職可能由美國民政方面高級專員瓜代之，如發生上述事宜，美國即可任意委任而不必徵求其他國家之全意。除澳洲外，所有國家在上週之遠東委員會會議中，均贊成此項基本決策，澳洲則要求給予一星期之時間，以老慮若干技術問題。但基本決策之擬成即由澳洲所發起，澳洲諒不致妨礙決策之通過。若干委員承認該政策似有落伍之處，但認為佔領計劃殊有正式加以確定之必要，且大部份佔領計劃早已予以實施。</p>
<h3>伊朗下令解散　軍事管制組織</h3>
<p>〔中央社德黑蘭十五日合衆電〕伊朗總理今下令，解散德黑蘭之軍事管制組織，定十七日生效。渠稱，此一組識係於一九四一年盟軍進入伊胡時組成，已無此需要，蓋治安秩序業已恢復也。</p>
<h3>威爾斯廣播　美應努力促成　歐洲合衆國　蘇具有統治全球野心</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕美國前國務副　威爾斯十五日發表廣播稱：渠認為美國應儘其所能，鼓勳歐洲建立合衆國。在建立歐洲合衆國期際，美國協助歐洲不應猶豫，渠完全贊同杜魯門主義，但認為「吾人之失敗，乃在此項政策之實　間題，需以迅速及有效地加强美國之諾曾，時間間題尤為最重要者，歐洲現正遭遇戰爭以遷之最嚴重危機，驚蘇聯諸領袖現已決定採取侵略性據展政策，以達到控制歐洲及地中海之目的，最後同樣控制亞洲。自歡洲戰事結束以來，此項情形益透明顯。同樣如蘇聯之上述企聞獲得成功，其勢力將迅速蔓延至全球各地，包括西半球在內」。</p>
<h3>美設委會研究　航空安全措施</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕杜魯門總統今日任命專家五人，組織航空安全調查委員會。民用航空局局長蘭第斯被任為該委員會之主席，首次會議定星期二召開。總統致慈會之函，表示對空運安全，尤其於最近飛機一再出事之後，極表關切，請該會研究最近之失事案，並決定應採何種措施，以促進航空安全。總統並請該會建議，現在製造中之航空配備應如何予以改良。</p>

<h3>四部乒乓　冠軍產生　郵甲力克四明甲</h3>
<p>二屆上海乒乓聯賽，前晚八時由四部郵甲四明甲舉行最後一戰於積浜橋中央大會堂，觀衆四百餘人，裁判陳季茂馮蟾初，準時發令開賽，郵甲先聲奪人，周新棠姜春山劉造時三將，擊來勇不可當，對手無招架之功，連敗三陣，似可一鼓而下，豈知第四組起，郵甲主將李光耀大意輕敵，竟為四明甲袁上有以直落三取勝，第五組郵田後起削球好手張其洪，又為對方主將吳達權以三對〇擊敗，第六組郵甲宿將王惠軍又失常態，抽球無力敗陣，四明甲愈戰愈勇，速板三組，打成各三平爭，震驚四座，末組郵甲胖將莊坤榮異常賣力，四明甲鄭敬　資格雖老，生疎已久，抽擊多野球，力不從心，莊得以從容奏捷，結果郵甲以四對三力克四明甲，奪得四部冠軍。四明甲與綠　積分相等，將定於明日（十八日）下午八時，在郵務球室舉行亞軍決賽，以定入選總決資格。茲錄兩隊戰績如下：</p>

<h3>代理政府收購外銷物資　四機構組審價會　收購對象暫時僅桐油猪鬃兩種</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府爲協助出口物資推動外銷貿易計，業已批准由中央銀行，中央信託局，審計部，輸出推廣委員會四機構，聯合組設代理政府收購外銷物資審價委員會。該會主任委員爲中信局局長吳任滬。委員有中央銀行業務局吳副局長，中信局副局長沈熙瑞，沈祖同，羅吟　，審計部製治權，輸出會陳雋人等。經常辦公處設中信局內。該會每週約集會三次，討論收購工作之推進，收購價格之審議等事項。收購對象，目前聞尙僅及桐油猪鬃二種。惟政府原定收購之主要出口物資，有桐油·猪衆·茶·絲·蛋品·大豆等六種。由該會在各出口物資之產區進行收購。該項收購工作並無張制性。收購價格則悉照國內市價爲標準云。</p>
<h3>收兌金飾能否變通　日內可正式決定　銀樓業請願代表由京返滬</h3>
<p>本市銀樓業同業公會代表吳彭年姚桂鄕等，聯合各地代表，組織請願團，於上週初晋京向中樞作最後一次之請願，要求通融經營金飾買賣。姚氏等已於昨晨返滬，據稱：代表等提出解除目前銀樓業厄述，修改辦法二點：（一）請求修正收進及出售價格，以國行掛牌爲標準，按當地物價指數，由同業公會呈報當地行政機關，審核備案。（二）准許銀樓業收買　餘黄金條塊及飾金，雙成飾物出售，但保證不將原條　售出。以上兩項意見，決由行政院徵詢財部意見後，聞十八日可正式批覆云。</p>

<h3>食米市銷淸解　白粳價已回挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共計到米六千一百餘石，天氣轉晴，內地回平，市銷淸懈，白粳回挫一二萬元，秈米中次回跌二三萬元，白元陰元均跌二萬餘元。</p>
<p>粉市消化較股，微升一二千元，洋粉則挺昂三五千元，麩皮鄉銷轉暢，轉升三四千元。豆餅汕頭續辦，步砌二三千元。黄豆因豆腐店復業，零化熟鬧，油廠納取，猛漲萬元。菉豆站局，赤豆交易寥落，依然平正。生仁廣帮進胃甚旺，扶搖直上，步漲六七千元。</p>
<p>芝蔴洋莊續吸，冉冉上升，續漲萬元。紅糧趨勢平定，苞米暫無上落，蠶豆客帮動而不旺，近郊及浙省長江一帶來貨接連，四川蠶豆亦已到申，高定次疲，仍難生色。</p>
<p>油市挺秀，生油廣方採辦，續挺一二萬元，豆油淸油隨之上升萬元，菜油蔴油均加一二萬元。</p>
<h3>平價麵粉　今起賡續配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕平價麫粉，自今日起，又將賡續由麫粉商業公會負責配售。聞中信局六月份下半月之撥配量，共爲七七〇七四包。（每包七十磅）。公會方面將每日撥配八九九二包，（每包五寸磅）。內切麵業二八五九包，浦　區切　業二三五包，餅饅業四一三七包，吳淞區餅饅業四四包。此外恢復饅頭業配粉三一二。配價照舊，計七十磅粉廠價萬五千七百元，另售價十一萬一千元。五十磅粉，廠價七萬五千五百元，另售價七萬九午三百元</p>
<h3>華茶美銷黯淡　十萬餘噸遭退回</h3>
<p>頃據茶業關係方面消息：中國茶葉美銷前途，仍欠光明。過去二十年中，已趨衰落，戰後品質更為低下。美國每年消費茶葉量，總額約達六千萬磅，其中百分之八十爲印度錫蘭茶，中國及台灣所產者僅占百分之二十。以本年一月至五月輸美總量而言，共計四十萬另六千四百十四磅，除龍井一千二百十五磅，祁門五萬三千四百三十磅，看片一萬二千四百十八磅，及綠茶二萬八千〇四十四磅，均係整批銷售外，其他計平水·鳥龍·綠茶等，遭整批退回者，總額達十萬另六百八十九磅。</p>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，因買戶態度猶豫，交易依然寥若晨星。他若各種內銷茶，本街及客帮仍有去化，尤以蘇州等地，走銷較形蟬聯，人心續穩，做開價格，尙稱堅秀。津帮需求不戢之綠茶芯，前以吐納喊價懸殊不一，卒乏成交，而刻下進購者出價每擔雖由三萬五千元，逐步加至四萬二三千元，但貨主仍不忍割愛。</p>
<h3>台糖又到一批</h3>
<p>合灣糖業總公司上海辦事處，業定下月一日開始發售袋頭糖，由本市四大公司代理經售。該項袋頭糖計分五磅·十磅·兩種，聞其售價略高於戶口糖，而竣秘魯糖尤廉云。又國營招商局海隴輪，昨晨由台抵滬，內裝台糖三千噸，合計三萬三千包，刻已在卸貨中。</p>
<p>又訊：昨糖市以實銷仍呆，趨勢平痰，惟起伏尙少，僅數千元上落，公會劃盛，秘魯砂最後爲五十六萬五千元。二〇中砂白四十六萬五千元，台赤三十七萬元，三半車白四十九萬七千元。號貨開汕提靑三十一萬五千元至三十一萬元，興化白四十四五萬元，興赤三十二萬八千元至三十三萬二千元，刁靑二十八萬五千元至二十八萬元，成交五百餘件</p>
<h3>肥皂交易轉暢</h3>
<p>昨日用品市况，以銀根微露鬆弛，塲上做開轉見熱鬧，行情挺俏。全日市勢以一百塊箱黄祥茂皂步升一萬元爲最鉅，一二〇塊亦漲九千元。其他固本箭力及光華牛牌等皂，俱升一二千至四五千元。</p>
<p>火柴市面熱門貨美麗凰鳳兩牌，軋升一二萬元，其餘雜牌平定，洋燭鷄牌續漲一萬，爲二十五萬元，火油桶裝六十五萬，價格站定。</p>
<h3>香煙市況挺俏</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟因熱銷貨塲中轉賣已稀，市上銀根鬆弛，門莊實需殷切，買意頗强，市塲人心堅昂，行情俱見扳俏？十支大英牌開後，步昂至六百四十六萬元。老刀牌價亦欣欣向榮。午市十支大英烟回至六百四十三萬元收盤，比上日（星期）繼漲二十一萬元。老刀五百四十八萬，亦升十八萬元。五華牌帶上十七萬元，哈德門烟因拋貨甚多，只升一萬元？各檔烟價大都挺俏、蓋因籌期關係，並間廠家有减少生產之訊，市塲同業咸加揣測，收購紛起，市勢乃漸成活潑氣象。</p>
<h3>烟煤逢低有吸</h3>
<p>漢；烟煤辰溪層等，據產地來訊：當地已禁止出口，老窿白煤及焦炭，近已跌進辦本，故同業逢低即有大量吸進，脚地漸轉穩定。煤球因源華層鑛價提高，一度調整廠盤。茲因各煤炭店門銷淸淡，故各廠嚐中均貼回佣，無形减低廠盤，藉以競爭。</p>
<h3>紗布齊漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，雖逢紡建公司開紗之期，市上各方吸納甚暢，廠方不肯輕易出售，並聞紡管會有停止收貿民營紗廠之訊，故市價猛晋。二十支紗以細布漂布上揚，特變馬猛升廿五萬元，雙馬紗軋升卅五萬元，其餘四二支卅二支細紗及十六支十支組紗均高二十萬元至四十萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，本客兩帮吸胃懈怠，而業外人因銀根鬆弛，不乏拉提，故價突吿飛漲。十二磅各檔細每布疋比週六猛升自七千至一萬五六千元，漂布亦升一二萬不等，其他元布斜紋及元直　嗶嘰等，無一不漲云。</p>
<h3>在華橡皮市場　英商暫無恢復訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前傳鄧祿普公司派代表至天津，計劃恢復中國之橡皮市塲；並傳該公司將拋售印度存貨脚踏車胎五六萬付，附贈銅圈，其價格較之國貨爲廉。記者頃以此事詢諸工商輔導處，據云：此說已成過去。目前橡膠業之困難，全在生橡膠之輸入。現全國之需要量爲三千五百噸，橡膠本受英美法荷四國統制，今年起統制取消，但自輸入限期辦法實行後，有原料在手者奇貨可居，在一個月內每磅價格自一千元增至萬元，尙不易購得。現因生橡膠一部可結匯，價格回跌至五六千元，但進口膠數量仍不敷應用，實際上一部份係仰賴走私者。橡膠業爲我國有希望之產業，其原料之入口應予放寬。</p>
<h3>多頭紛紛加碼　華股漲風頗健　證金又有新傳說</h3>
<p>華股昨業中人多頭紛紛加碼，永紗現遞均漲達限度。華豐新光兩小熱，角逐不已前者現交一度再吿漲停，惟高後亦易回降。遞交證金忽有將改爲三成現金二成代用品之謠，趨勢仍屬盤漲居多。</p>
<p>晨初因傳說週六所方曾獲部令兩通，內容不詳，但人心頗露驚恐。幸新光永紗均開高盤，得以轉穩。遞永紗開後，即由八三號一六〇號八二號一一二號賣到六八〇〇元。二二四號二二三號一四號一八五號九七號三六號亦加了結，此時因八五號二一八號尙進，市價在六八〇〇內外，頗費掙扎。一五七號六五號二四號一〇四號六一號一四號九七號一再供給，聯華由一六二號等雖掛漲停，遞永紗絡吿迫低至六六〇〇元。二二四號一九〇號一七一號一八六號趁低購納，一五二號來進現永紗，即回升至六八〇〇元外。一六三號一九九號尙省供給，但以二二四號二二三號五四號八九號一六〇號一五三號一〇七號一六號三二號均進，八九號並將現永紗進至七〇〇〇元外。遞永紗乃漲到七〇六〇元。七六號三一號雖加了結，二二四號三二號三六號三五號一五七號更進至七二〇〇元外，現永紗首先由八九號掛漲停，一八六號一一七號八五號一四三號趁高賣到七二〇〇元。三二號三五號九九號八九號買胃仍健，華豐郎交及新亞亦吿迫近漲停。此時遞永紗亦一度漲達限度，二二號七六號一〇二號一四八號三六號五四號一九〇號九四號二一八號一〇四號紛紛脫手。傳遞交證金有改爲現金三成，代用品二成之謠，而回跌至七〇〇〇元關。八號一九六號六九號一九六號雖進至七二〇〇元外但以二二四號力加脫手，遞永紗於十二時，終吿破入七千元大關。八五號一一七號五四號六五號一五二號一四八號一一二號二一三號紛納一五二號八九號幷將遞永紗拉上至漲停板，再回升至七二〇〇元外。十二時二十分，中法於泯亂中由七三號賣到跌停，二二三號九七號賣出，遞永紗以七一三〇元結束。收後初由一六九號等進至七二〇〇元，後由一九九號賣到七一二〇元左右。結果較上週六計永紗華豐漲停後有回，各漲一成弱。新光信和各升半成弱，永公美亞微升，勤興新華平平，中法景福徽挫，聯華地產漲達限度，中絲平平，新亞漲停後有回，尙漲半成强。麗安商務量綸各跌半成，五和徽降，餘均微漲。遞交計永紗漲停後有回，與華豐同漲半成强，信和升半成不到，永公景福微降，美亞新光勤興微升。塲外各老股計中華升一成，世界微挫，華商五洲各升半成，餘尙見平‘</p>
<h3>王志莘等晉京　磋商證金問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所遞延交易證據金代用品部份，自變通爲在部令尙未到達前，暫仍准以現金或債券抵用後，茲以該項變通辦法，終未能懸而不決，且遞交六底限期，轉瞬即屆，爲澈底洽商妥善解決辦法計，證交總經理王志莘，協理楊蔭溥，顧善昌，及財經兩部駐證交監理官王鰲堂，吳宗燾及財部錢幣司司長戴銘禮等，業於日前聯袂乘晚車晋京。聞王氏等此行，將與財經兩部當局從長研究，俾便快定對證交完善之施策云。</p>
<h3>蘇浙皖繭訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據蠶絲產銷協導會消息：春繭收購情形，迄目前爲止，江蘇省已達十一萬担，浙江省達九萬五千担，安徽省達一千祖。聞各省收繭成本，連開支在內，每担約扯國幣一百五十萬元云。</p>
<h3>中信局配售人絲　綢廠有吸價繼續堅挺</h3>
<p>中央信託局代理出售政府物資財產委員會，今（十六）日第卅一次配售絲織業人絲，共計配出人絲一百七十八箱。聞該會自上年開始配售人絲至本次止，總計配出人絲一萬七千二百廿八箱。</p>
<p>又該局易貨處負責人談稱：上月日本裝運來華之人造絲共六十富磅，（每二百磅爲一箱），計合三千箱。麥帥總部頃來電云：預計本月份運華爲四十萬磅，該局榻副理津生，在日接洽易貨完畢，於日前搭輪返國，預計本週內可抵滬云。</p>
<p>又訊：昨市人造絲繼續堅挺，因綢廠帮頗有去胃，執貨者乘機高抬，一二〇號東洋有我，上午開盤九百四十萬元有成交，迄午收盤爲九百三十萬元。下午各方吸意仍濃，故市價再造挺進，最後喊價爲九百十萬元，比上週六漲起八十萬元。天橋新貨爲九百六十萬元，其餘雜牌爲九百五十萬元，且係散裝貨而無木箱，趨勢今市尚須看好。</p>
<p>廠絲昨市況稍振，各級喊價比上週六均大起五十萬元之左，昨只做開D字等級五担，價二千千四百萬元，不過有五六天期頭。C字等級討價四百五十萬元，並未成交。老虎灶新絲亦有幾担成交，價自二千一百五十萬至二百五十萬元幾檔。千經去胃甚微，昨乏成交。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨因原料高昂，人心看好，以致被面及格子　縐均告提升。華強被面八百九十五萬元有成交，大誠被面喊九百十萬元，比上週六大十萬元。格子瑩縐開市做即期四千二百元。格子瑩縐開市做即期四千二百元，隔日期四百元，中途又好起一百元，後因有大戶批售，價遂低回，撮後成交為四千元，隔日期四千二百元。華錦縐因人造絲告漲，價亦隨之而大，高檔貨喊一萬八千元，普通貸一萬七千五百元有交易，其餘各貨成交甚微，市價均堅站</p>
<h3>統債微漲　外股續昂</h3>
<p>昨稍見漲，銀根鬆動，五五二室等有納，六〇四室三六〇室則出，統丙晨開七三〇〇元，自七一〇〇元升至八〇〇〇元，而後在七六〇〇元左右徘徊，成交約六七百萬。結果較上週六計甲乙升二百元，丙升一百元，丁戊各漲三百元。</p>
<p>外股昨仍以英聯漲風爲最勁，怡紗不過盤局而已。港申電縮至十四元三，證券帮若童某力進英聯，合盛買胃亦健，廣帮及散戶有供，怡紗晨開六九〇〇〇元，高價七二〇〇〇元，近午回低至六九〇〇〇元徘徊。結果較上週六計英聯漲一成不到，怡唓墾植微降，會德豐紙業航業鋼業各漲半成，餘均微升而已。</p>
<h3>棉市堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日棉花市況，因銀根由緊轉鬆，上午棉紗各檔收盤價較上週六漲起二十萬至四十萬不等於是人心向上，一致看好。同業成交頗旺，紗廠進意亦濃，市況較週六旺盛，價格呈堅挺之勢。午後印棉白洛去做開一五八萬茄力拉由一二八萬起至一三五萬，本街紗廠進L．S．S印棉三百餘件，價六四〇萬。其餘靈寳做開棧交現款價一五〇萬，又七天期票價爲一五四萬，沙市做開一四一萬，冲沙市爲一三七萬五千元，漢細一一三萬至一一五萬，又送廠價爲一二〇萬，通州粗絨一二〇萬，火機一〇五萬，南太倉北太倉一一五萬送廠，各檔成交數均在數百件以上。</p>
<h3>錢業月報復刋</h3>
<p>錢業月報創刋於民國十年，爲上海市錢商業同業公會發行，內容精湛，甚得學術界好評。廿六年淞滬戰後，上海淪陷，該報隨之停刋。茲聞該報經公會決議，定於七月十五日復刋，並推定沈日新·鄒讓鄕·為發行人，魏友＃等爲編輯人，積極籌備。該報地址現暫附設上海寗波路錢業公會內。</p>
<h3>木材市況</h3>
<p>杉木跌勢將戰，比前量高峯已跌三分之一。洋松因未暴漲，現亦未大跌，在七千元之間盤旋。檜木市上有來貨到滬，價將下降。</p>
<h3>紗商昨舉行會議　要求開放北運　北方紗價昂騰情勢嚴重　要求依漢口例取消管制</h3>
<p>本市紗布北運同業一百餘家，因北運紗布目本年二月統制以來，營業陷於停頓，時於昨日午後，在紗布公會舉行緊急會議。由高聞道主席，決議一致反對統制辦法，要求取消管制，恢復運銷自營。將請求當局依照漢口例，迅速取消北運管制辦法。幷按紗布轉運給證簡則辦理，以維商艱。據該業表示，華北東北北運紗布商向紡管會登記者共二五五家，但每月准許出口之紗貨祗三千餘件，而紗號祇千餘件，不時使滬上紗布商生機豐絕，且將使華北紗布發生恐慌。現東北華北紗價高漲，足以刺激紗價上騰。當局依民國十九年生產量作標準，殊不知該時有大量日紗暢銷華北，故洪應可無慮缺乏。現日紗斷絕，如滬紗不運往，將使華北人民衣着問題日臻嚴重，故該業堅決要求當局開放北運，以維營業云。</p>
<h3>進出口商再請　撤銷限期結匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市進出口商業同業公會前以中央銀行對於各出口委託銷售出；貨。統限於五月二十四日前售結匯，否則由指定銀行之國外分行執行不限價代售，消息傳來，國外市堪乘機抑價，國內出口商羣情惶恐，經該會痛陳利害得失，電請中央有關部院，及中央銀行撤銷限期，以疏商困。茲聞中央銀行對於前項出售結匯限期，再予延長三十天，至六月二十四日爲止，渝期不再考慮變通辦法。進出口公會以出口貨往往因時令，或需要關係，一時不易銷售，限期結匯，不帝勒令廣價出售，影響所及，不特使出口商蒙受重大損失，而國內土產出口，亦將更趨停滯，於國於民，均屬有害，故昨特再兩中央銀行，務請撤銷限期云。</p>

<p>車站上停了許多火車頭，為數有三十多個，而現在可以使用的即有十四個之多。將來修理之後，二十多個火車頭將不成問題。此在鐵路交通當局，當器材頗感缺乏之今日，該是一個很大的動力。</p>
<p>共軍攻城時，曾一度抵達車站，旋即退出。至今軍站兩旁房屋，彈痕處處，一似滿目遼　。但附近的居民，熟規旣慣，無動乎中；老嫗以其伶仃小足在磨着麥麩，不時以驚奇的目光，投射於我們這一羣遠來的旅客身上，天際則歸鴉成陣，頻噪晚風，蓋兗州歷經險阻，現在已經恢復它的寗靜了。</p>
<p>四等小縣</p>
<p>兗州已改稱滋陽縣。縣境甚小，列於四等，不及滕縣三分之一。它的重要性完全由軍事上形成。一方面當津浦兗濟兩路之啣接點，交通四達；而且西部純為低窪之區，歷代以還，均稱盜藪。當初梁山泊上好漢的根據地，即在今鄲城附近；蔡京坐鎭兗州，終使這一班小醜無從跳樑。直到現在，共軍劉伯誠殘部三四千人，尚頑踞此問，在鄲城的偽縣政府多至九個，他們還想重溫一下梁山泊草莽英雄的好夢。將來如談淸剿，兗州自然仍是一個很好的根據地。</p>
<p>彭氏風度</p>
<p>記者抵兗州後，趨訪省府魯西南辦事處主任彭國棟氏。彭為湘之茶陵人，過去數任軍政要職，近以徐州綏靖公署總務處長調主此間。他和魯省主席王耀武，尚無一面之緣。王氏因為前在第九戰區時，彭任政治部副主任，略知其懷抱和學識。所以任主席不久，就多次函電敦促主魯西，魯南之行政兼省委，在宦風日下的今日，而還能有像王，彭兩的民這樣的人和這樣的作風，予記者以極深刻的良好的印象。我與彭主任傾談半日，互嗟軍事時期老百姓負担之重為一隱憂。辦事處的所在地，在宋為少陵書院，在明為龍興寺，迄今龍興寺的寶塔還高峯在城的東北角。庭中有土阜一座，是全城最高的地方，上有工部祠堂，祀工部石像。工部的封翁，曾宰此地，工部時來省親，故留下這樣一個紀念。</p>
<p>魯王遺事</p>
<p>記者與趙主任登臨遠眺，全城在望；彭氏遙指明魯王駐蹕之處，今成廢墟。據說當時王宮油脂棄地，所以附近地區特別肥沃，每畝田中皆有水井，以資灌溉。年收凡三次，每次收穫，可以供全城三個月的食糧。晨風拂處，麥浪起伏，農大捲禈傴　，芟刈其間，記者　彭氏瑣話渝桑，思潮之起伏靡已。土阜的南面，有臨街巨宅，連綿數台。就是平劇中審頭剌湯一故事的　蹟。朦縣的兩下店，是和梁山伯祝英台同學戀愛故事有關係地方，峰山山麗，且有兩人的祠堂，記者經過其地，行旅怱怱，以未能一事參觀為憾。但在這裏却又看到這一件古代情殺案的舊址，也算彌補過去。湯氏舊業裱褙，這裏人都稱之曰「湯裱褙家」，頗含輕視之意，可惜記者不諸　，古否則倒很可訪問一下了。</p>
<p>風沙情調</p>
<p>兗州街道很長從車站至東門有二三華星，東門至西門則五華里有餘。這兩段戰前是商業區，現在已形冷落。在迷且的黃沙中來來去去者，除了軍用汽車以外，只有笨重的牛車，慢斯條理地向前拖着，駕駛的人，不時用鞭子打到牛背上，並且發出「啊…噓……」的聲音。路旁大商店多半關門，拿照相館來說，雖有四五家，但是我照的幾捲軟片，竟沒有一家敢承接下去沖，原因是沒有把握沖得出來。　是這邊的主要食品，只有荳漿油條，還帶點南方風味，而其價已達五百元一根，有很少數商店中出售白米，並加上「江南大米」，「無錫淸米」等等的字眼兒，這在南方人看起來，就是很濃重的北方情調了。我是南方人，口胃不同，只有吃每斤三千六百元的大米。三千六百元一斤，訊起來每石達五十四萬之巨。</p>
<p>所謂三多</p>
<p>我在一家很富麗的浴室裏洗了一個澡。我和堂倌閒話家常，他告訴我兗州有三多：井多，廟多，明的不多暗的多。井多是地理上的因素所造成。山東中部多山，而西部為一大半原，運河及獨山湖縱貫其問，西部山同諸水，乃都特別向西北流注入運河或湖中；這，影響到運河本身的容量問題，並因此造成蘇北運河時常決堤的主要原因；但却便利了這一帶的人們，掘地數尺，即可得水。若論廟多，此在神權的社會中，尚不足為怪，而在我看來，此間的廟宇，也够不上算如何的多，至於第三句是指私娼而言，據說此間公娼很少，這在禮義之邦並且密還聖地的地方，容許有其傳統的假面具在。</p>
<p>城門出入</p>
<p>軍事當局之嚴密檢查，已使兗州城內外分為兩個地區。城門口出入者，大半軍人，民衆絕少。李正中縣長相告，省方派某員來此接事，結果不得其門而入，雖有省府委令亦不能通過。其後還是請熟人轉告縣府，由縣府派人「引導」，才告解決。職是之故，城內城外，貨不能暢其流，城內物價已高於城外一倍。這一點大槪是軍方在過去惡劣球境之下的細心，一變而成習慣了；否則今日在重兵屯守下的兗州，火綫已經打到二百里以外，為什麼還是作如是之戒備呢？　念蘇北睹縣，離城十數里甚至數里即是共軍出沒之所，倘如移置此問，我不知又將如何？我曾和李縣長談及此事，覺得為兗州社會前途着想，亟盼當局能注意及此。</p>
<p>行政奇蹟</p>
<p>我和李縣長及縣府孫又謀秘書二君還談到縣行政的困難之處。前任馬某，奉調泰安，他們兩位，走馬上任，接印還沒有幾天。馬縣長任內，因孤城苦守，忙於應付軍事，所以應辦事情固然沒有舉辦，而縣府之組織，根本就與目前法令不合。目前，縣府正忙於改組，並忙於戶口調查。</p>
<p>談到公教人員待過，他先告訴我最高的數字，科長先生每月二十二萬元；小職員有拿七萬八千元者，按之縣府中兩頓麫條之伙食，每月尚需十一萬元；那就是說：在縣政府中幹事，每月得從家中帶三萬二千元來·每天才能有兩頓麫條兒果腹。他若勤務之流，每月有二萬元者，有三萬元者，喝水總還足够。其次，軍差之應付，亦是苦事。現在兗州城內的軍事機構，多至二百餘個單位。他歷舉了好多為難的例子給我聽。他們兩位過去服務於徐州緩署，在部隊中也着實幹過幾年。他們說，過去在軍中，總以為部隊的要求，在縣政府應當是一舉手之勞，不見得怎麽費力；現在臨到自己頭上，才知道縣太爺之不易做。言下頗有懺悔之意。現身說法，軍政同仁，閱此當表同情。承縣長之情，邀我吃一頓下午麫——這是他們的第二餐，並且特加了一個炒蛋，以變我這一個　客。席間列舉待辦之事，諸如：民衆組訓，靑年組訓，行政幹部訓練班，圖書館，民衆教育館，識字班，衛生啘………等等，我故意掃興地打斷他的話；「萬事要錢噢！」他說得好：「先　不花錢的辦！」</p>
<p>魯中戰事以第二兵團為主力。我謁見到王敬久總司令；他告訴我戰塲上的動態，並且堅決地戰：「在最近國軍新布　完成以後，戰局將有重大的轉變！」他是「徐州三王」之一，個子高，晚話沉着。</p>
<p>司令部是借設於規模宏偉之某機關內，在此間常推獨步。紅瓦黃牆，斑斕奪目，令人興莊嚴威烈之感！</p>

<h3>塘沽新港一瞥（中）</h3>
<p>— 天津八日航訊　邢契莘</p>
<p>新港之興築，係日人於二十六年秋，侵佔華北以後，為謀掠取華北之生要物資，如大同之煤，龍烟之鐵，長蘆之鹽及隸土等項，並為對華輸入成品起見，乃決定在華北　港，當時對於築港地點，幾經研究，南滿鐵路技術人員主張，建於大淸河口附近，即　國父孫先生所主張之北方大港地位，日軍部認為塘沽運輸便利，有天津商埠在其後，工商業易於發展，及築港時間有經濟上之便利，乃決定在塘沽　港，二十八年六月，在北平設立塘沽新港臨時事務所，縣屬於興中公司，開始調查堪測，當時計劃頗為宏大，預定以每年驗出煤二千萬噸及鹽鐵　石等七百萬噸為目標，而以每年吞吐量八百萬噸為第一期工程，二十九年十月開工，三十年十月改隸於華北交通公司，更名為塘沽新港港灣局，動員最多時，’職員約一千人，技工約二千五百人，小工約一萬人，所需款項約當時偽聯幣八九億元，同時開始興　大同塘沽間直達鐵路，至三十四年八月，抗戰勝利時，同塘鐵路僅究成二十四公里，築港工程完全停工，其施工部份完成之程度並不一致，茲將已施工之重要工程，分述於次：</p>
<p>施工經過</p>
<p>一，防波堤：據實測結果，南防波堤完成五公里，一部份完成者四公里餘，北防波堤一部份完成者約六公里，積防波堤部份僅完成五四〇公尺。</p>
<p>二，航道：入港航通已挖深至五公尺，長約十三公里，寬一百三十公尺，可由新港通至新港第一二碼頭。</p>
<p>三，碼頭：新港第一碼頭長七百公尺完成約百之九十，第二碼頭長三百五十公尺，一部份完成</p>
<p>四，船閘；船閘建造工程已完成百分之八十。</p>
<p>五，機械工廠：機械工廠使有簡單設備，略具雛型。</p>
<p>六，船舶：船舶及水上機械約一百餘艘。</p>
<p>七，鐵路公路：鐵道由塘沽車站通至新港第一第二碼頭，長十公里，公路完成路面六公里，其餘均凹凸不平。</p>
<p>勝利以後，三四年十月，由交通部平津區特派員辦公處接收，設立塘沽新港港務處，三十五年四月改為交通部塘沽新港工程處，八月改為交通部塘沽新港工程局</p>
<p>接收以後</p>
<p>塘沽新港，在日人投降後，工程完全停頓，秩序極為紊亂，船舶沉沒，材料散失，機器毀拱，房屋破壞，道路坎坷，車輛缺乏，食宿困難，幾有滿月荒凉之景象，三十五年四月接收後，乃作緊急之處置，為復工之準備，如修理辦公房屋及宿舍，整治道路，添置交通器具及電信設備等項五六兩月隊為整理工作期間，七月以還，始將日人作成一部份之工程先行繼續完成，以期即時應用，並製成臨時工作計劃，自七月至十二月按月實施，至於年終，應辦工程均已完竣，自三十六年一月份起，即按照三年計劃逐漸施工。</p>
<p>茲將三十五年四月至三十六年三月重施工作及其進度略述於次：</p>
<p>建造船閘</p>
<p>船閘工程，自三十四年八月停工，三十五年七月始復工，歷時一年之久機械殘毀，材料損失，船閘亦淹沒水中，經四個月之整理趕造，至十一月中旬完成木面以下工程，將兩側擋水土壩挖開，放水入閘，十二月十五日，地上各項工程，機械設備全部竣工，幷將港內航道疏濬至低潮下三至四公尺，試行通航成績良好，各輪船公司紛紛請求通過，計自三十五年十二月十七日至三十六年三月三十一日，共通淑船舶六十四艘。</p>
<p>以往三千噸級輪船，經大沽口入海河時，須在口外先用　船卸貨一部份，方能進口，而由海河出大沽口時，其一部份貨物，亦須俟輪船至口外後，始能用駁船裝足，現在經過船閘，則可滿載出入减省駁運之煩，於航業便利甚大。</p>
<p>整頓船舶</p>
<p>收回船舶；新港船舶，在日人投降後，被各方面挪用，散在各地，接收後首先向招商局索回拖輸六艘，九月向駐塘沽美軍方面收回起重機船二艘汽油艇一艘，十月由靑島港務局察回挖泥船一艘，及山東保安第八團索回拖輪二艘運土船一艘，十二月又由上海招商局案回拖船一艘，共計收回船舶十四艘，其餘各處挪用之船舶，尚在接洽收回之中。</p>
<p>（二）打撈船舶：接收以前，沉沒各處之船舶甚多，因工人工具均不充足，祗得分別緩急陸續打撈，現已撈起船舶十四艘，其餘正在打撈中。</p>
<p>（三）修理船舶：港原存及打撈之船舶約八十餘艘，大都損壞不堪使用，乃趕土修理以應急用，又為速成計，將一部份船舶發交國營或商營工廠修理，總計自修船舶共三十八艘，發交外廠修理者計十八艘。</p>
<p>趕工濬渫</p>
<p>勝利以後，工作停頓，因防波堤未完成，泥砂漂流入港，以致日見淤塞，九月測量結果，主航道僅深二至三公尺，第一碼頭前淤積至二公尺，自三十五年十月份起，使用現有挽泥船四艘，幷借用海河工程局自航式挖泥船一艘，趕工濬渫，航道挖深至三公尺半，第一碼頭前一部份挖深四至五公尺，勉可通航，同時利用挖出之泥土，輪送沉　於第一第二碼頭北隅應塡之低地，共計已塡土量約十六萬立方公尺。</p>
<p>其他一程</p>
<p>（一）給水設備：完成給水工程，除供給工廠及負工宿舍用水外，港內停泊船隻亦隨時供給淡水，以備開動輪機及旅客飲水之用。</p>
<p>（二）修建道路：接收後，港內各道路大都破壞高低不平，經次第修建始勉可應用，約計修建這路一二·五公里·面積十萬平方公尺。</p>
<p>（三）修造房崖：新建及修理房屋，共計面積二萬餘平方公尺。</p>
<p>碼頭業務</p>
<p>碼頭分為塘沽及新港兩處，塘沽碼頭四座係濱海河，新港碼頭係在港內，因新港碼頭前淤泥未完全挖除，停船尚少，本年一月中旬，第一碼頭前一部份挖深至五公尺，五千噸級之新中國巨輪，已在該處停泊，裝卸貨物，惟現在所有業務大部份尚在塘沽碼頭。</p>
<h3>明湖放棹</h3>
<p>— 杭州十日訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>杭州正泛起了像盛暑般的熱浪，繼着又是淅淅瀝瀝的下着雨，暑氣被陰雨趕走，又像到了初秋的季節。西子湖也隨着氣候的轉變，時而嬌艷如火，時而溫靜如水。記者在一個雨後陰晴的下午約着豐子愷先生李朴園先生夫婦和新進作家無名氏先生邊湖去。</p>
<p>豐先生最愛西湖，愛她的嫻靜，恬淡；他曾在西南大後方為戀念西湖而作了一幅西湖的風景畫，他曾集古人讚美西子的詩句錄補壁欣賞。現在豐先生有小屋三間，在裏西湖葛嶺山的前面，却佈置得整潔典雅，這幅在後方為　念西子而作的畫還掛在客室的中央。他曾告訴我，他走來走去，跟過十多省，但覺還是西湖最好。</p>
<p>西子，她可以發人深思，沉緬在思想的領域裏·她可以使人超俗，到達崇高的境界。　　划艇紀程</p>
<p>我偕着無名氏用我們獨特的「申報划艇」划到裏西湖，　岸登陸，到十足中國型的宅前面，豐先生已迎出來了。李朴園先生夫婦早在豐先生家裏等，我們就約同下船。</p>
<p>問：「到那裏去」？</p>
<p>「隨划船者的高興」！豐先生說。於是慢慢地淌過了放鶴事，馮小靑墓，又滑過了蘇疊殊墓，我慨嘆着蘇小小墓如此的加以粉飾，而蘇曼殊墓却無人關懷。無名氏說：「這樣到好些。否則，曼殊大師亦將不安於地下了」。</p>
<p>划艇穿西冷橋而過，環抱着湖的羣山　上一層薄紗般的白霧。我又提出杭州應該建設為文化城的口號來，豐，李，無名氏三位當然表示讚成。在這裏，我們希望不要把杭洲建設為僅有皮表讓人欣賞欣賞而已的花園都市，更不要建設為不變理想的好萊塢式的東方好萊塢，我們要堂堂正正有美麗靈魂的文化都會。豐先生說：「文人那　住在繁雜的上海呢？大半因為兼職的關係，像在學校裏教書或在書館裏當編輯等，他們如果雖開了就不容易生活」。所以我們要呼籲學術文化機　應該遷到杭州來。同時國家應該獎勵文化的產品，應該對文人生活予以確切的保障。以上兩則都要政府下決心實施的，然而也有待於文化人土的一　和努力。</p>
<p>風雨歸舟</p>
<p>船已划過阮公墩，東風漸漸由湖心吹起，到三潭印月的小　洲，踏上九曲橋，又想起湖濱建築漆成朱紅顏鈀的刺眼來，這九曲橋的欄杆，萬字亭也是紅色的！但比較暗褐一些，豐李二位說：「像這種紅的顏色，到還顯得蒼老些，像斷橋等處的朱紅，似乎太漂亮了。」豐先生記起三潭印月從前有一付俞曲圈的聯語，現在不見了。他又記起楠木廳，於是我們折入先賢祠，那裏却顯得殘敗了。雖然幾間廂房廳室，依稀可以看出當年的感景，然而花徑荒蕪，樹枝零亂，屋中又是蓬垢滿室。我們竟到了楠木廳，有幾塊天花板已要跌落的樣子，但四根合抱的楠木，桂十獨勉強裝出堅張，來支持這所殘落的應院。應中有一匯，上看「閑放臺」，四週玻窗破缺，窗檻佈滿蛛絲。豐先生捋着長奪，說這裏曾出過一件案子：「在戰前，有一位女郎，　到楠木　左側的厠所去，那裏知道有一個強盜將她砍斃，奪取女郎的金手鐲。當時此地有電話通市區，湖濱即告戒嚴，此盜亦為所獲。」我們奮怪小瀘洲為進人必去之地，為何同在小　洲的楠木　却遭到了冷淡。我想進楠木廳可以稍加佈置，作為文人雅集之所，在楠木盧前面的幾間，可以作為文人臨時招待憩息之所。現在空着不用，未免太可惜了；而且任令荒蕪，也非保管名勝風景的辦法。</p>
<p>繞至小　洲停船石級處，烏襲從四方八面合攏來，雨輕輕地敲在我們的額上，湖上起着微微的波瀾，濃重的烟霧遮蔽了眼前的景物，我們的划艇向烟雨的深處駛去，同船五個人都異口同聲的說：「直是風雨歸舟。」</p>
<p>三不先生</p>
<p>豐先生本有「三　先生」之稱：所謂三灣，即昔年執教上海江灣，家居崇德閘門灣，住於嘉興楊柳灣。親在又有人稱他為「三不先生」了·即：一不教書，二不演講，三不參加任何宴會。他現在專門研究和寫作。李先生是戲劇運動的大將，他現在正導演着好幾個戲在杭州演出，我們要求他在這美麗的西子湖濱，再寫幾個劇本。無名氏先生是在西子湖畔潛心著述的，他可以說是潛心寫作（著有「野獸·野獸·野獸」等長篇）的新進作家。當天我備酒夜談，大家都感着還需要加強溫暖。</p>

<h3>民初帝俄代表在外蒙之活動</h3>
<p>— 鄭麟壽</p>
<p>帝俄時代之機密參事柯羅士托維次（Korostovetz，平生以任外交官為　，庚子拳亂之後，中俄關於南滿之交涉（一九〇一），以及日俄戰役（一九〇五〕朴資茅斯之和會，柯氏均任俄方之要員，一九〇七至一九一二年，俄廷特授駐華全權公使，自此被認為遠東問題之權威。是時帝俄方有事於外蒙，乃派柯氏為令權代表，赴庫倫與外蒙政府訂立條約，駐蒙首邑，凡八閱月，乃返俄京。越十數年，柯氏徵得柏林大學講師豪埃爾（Hauer）（曾譯「皇淸開國方略」等書）之合作，將其關於蒙古之認識與經歷，自蒙古之極盛時代起，迄一九二五年止，編輯成書，署其端曰「自成吉思汗至蘇維埃共和國」，一九二六年由德京柏林杜格羅達書局出版，是書洋洋巨觀，凡四十一章，附外蒙古共和國憲法一篇，計三五一頁，插圖三十八幅，外蒙詳圓一幅，洵蒙古史一類之佳作也。我國自淸末以還，國勢削弱，對於邊疆，已有鞭長菓及之歎，外力乘機侵入，謀我藩離。現正為我族奮發砥礪以圖自強之秋，何暇競事圍墻之鬥哉？柯氏書中論述俄蒙關係及俄國經營外蒙之過程甚詳，爰採其有關中·俄·蒙三方之重要節目，以告關懷外蒙間題之人士。</p>
<p>成吉思汗與拔都之世，俄土曾為蒙古所征服，俄之君主，例須朝謁可汗，進貢方物，黜陟均受蒙古節制，其後因蒙人內鬨頻興，勢力寢衰，外藩漸以離叛，迨至十六世紀中葉，俄人已不可復制矣，十八世紀之初，彼得大帝企圖打通北地至印度之路線，自是俄國勢力，始向亞洲中部伸張，以外蒙久屬中國屏障，勢必與我政府發生交涉，是以中俄尼布楚條約（一六八九），恰克圖條約（一七二七），愛琿條約（一八五八），皆莫不與蒙古有關。</p>
<p>俄蒙境界毘連，兩方之互市通商，象，俄人素視蒙古為原料供給之所，對此緩衝地帶之意義，益予以重視，專家會議，以及派遣商務考察團，深入蒙境，並非無因之舉，十九世紀末年，俄人紛紛率隊赴蒙考察，一九一〇年由莫斯科商會資遺一商務考察國，以W．Popow上校為幽長，俄京各大商家及商務部均有代表參加，團員於恰克圖集中，即分數隊出發，遍歷蒙地，南達張家口，此次對於俄國在蒙商務之推進，銀行之創辦等等，均有重要之貢獻，其後政府方面，又遣大學教授Bogolepow研究蒙古經濟情形，亦有專書發表。</p>
<p>至於俄蒙兩方之貿易品，自俄輸蒙者為工業製成品，布匹·鐵器·搪瓷用具·麵粉，糖·烟·火柴·酒·煤油·銀錠等；由蒙運俄，則以羊毛·皮革·各種·皮·豬羊腸等為大宗。中俄兩方在蒙之商業，更迭消長，一九一八至一九二二年，俄國內亂之際，其在中亞之地位，頗受影響，中國商務，則乘機得以發展。</p>
<p>辛亥革命，外蒙即宣告獨立，以DschebdsunDamba　Hutuktu為大可汗。其時外蒙乞助於俄，俄亦利於扶植外蒙之獨立，惟始初尚恐與中國發生衝突，猶豫未決。一九一一年，外蒙遣派代表赴彼得堡時，俄政府對於延見與否，尚多方予以考慮，終以駐華俄使之慫恿，政府之意始決。</p>
<p>俄當局主張助蒙樹立俄國勢力最積極者，厥為柯羅士托維次，一九一一年十二月，柯氏甫自北京返國，即數謁外交部長S．D．Sasonow與內閣總理W．N．Kotowzew交換意見，內閣遂商定特派柯氏為赴庫倫專使，經俄皇批准，並撥十萬盧布，置辦禮物及充旅費，此舉俄人雖極守秘密，然而俄蒙定約，新聞界已透露消息，北京政府大為不安，乃派諾顏圖Prinz　Noyantu赴庫倫遊說呼圖克圖，但為蒙人所阻，華方所遣軍隊，亦無法入境。</p>
<p>一九一二年九月初，柯氏離彼得堡，經伊爾庫次克，恰克圖，數日而抵庫倫，其時個外　政府之人物，總理為Sain　Noyan可汗，外長為PrinzHangda　Dorji，內長Da　Lama，財政部長Erdeni　Wang　Namsarai，軍政部長Dalai　Wang，泰半屬親俄份子。至於俄方參加談判之人員，除事使外，尚有秘書Eltekow，駐庫倫總領事Ljuba。</p>
<p>外蒙王公，初與俄人交涉，親華親俄，尚不知所可，　經柯氏再三解釋親俄之利，與親華之害，一面用懷柔手段，收買印刷所，創辦報紙，宣揚俄國文化，並設俄文學校，籠絡外蒙年，一面用恫嚇方式，向政府請求派兵入境，又迫親華之喇嘛退出會議，加以呼圖克圖夫人之暗助，親俄派終獲勝利。於是俄蒙條約與附件，竟於一九一二年十月二十一日簽訂。翌日，外長Hangna　Uorji親至俄領事館，代表呼圖克圖向柯氏致賀，並述親俄派之如何歡躍，親華派之如何失意，柯氏遂出盧布五萬，以捐助慈善事業之名義，為蒙人壽，並分贈諸王公以金表，烟盒，花瓶等物</p>
<p>至於條約之內容，俄方在彼得堡政府，已擬就草案，意在使蒙人接受而已。不料蒙方亦提出約章草案，大意謂「蒙古已脫離中國之壓制，而宣佈為獨立國家，自受大可汗之統治，俄國首先承認蒙古獨立，並願為之保護。」至於俄方所欲承認外蒙之自治，以及選舉呼圖克圖為君主之特權，絕不涉起，俄人非特無購置地產之權，且不得無獲照在境內旅行，因此種種，雙方意見紛歧，機與決裂，兩經往返商討，並肅淸異黨，始行定議。</p>
<p>條約原文四款，附件十七款，茲將其原約四款，迻譯如次：</p>
<p>第一款　帝俄政府對於蒙古之保持其自治並保有軍隊，予以協助，不容華軍入境，不容華人殖民。</p>
<p>第二款　蒙古君主及蒙古政府，允准俄國人民與俄國商業，得事受附件所載之一切權利，其他各國人民，當然不得享有優於俄國人民之權利。</p>
<p>第三款　設蒙古政府認為興中國或其他各國有訂立特約之必要，則未得帝國政府之同意時，該項特約不得損害或改變本條約及附件所載之各款。</p>
<p>第四款　本友好條約於簽字之日發生効力。　當今我國對強暴抗戰勝利之後，一股情勢，未盡改善，而受外力侵略之咸脅，依然存在，我四萬餘萬之炎黃子孫，經三十餘年之努力，所為何事？八年犧牲，代價又如何？撫今追昔，能無感慨？</p>

<h3>保護者</h3>
<p>— 子晉</p>
<p>樓下庭前有一片啾啾唧唧的小鶢的聲音，走下樓一看，果然是妻從鄉下人挑進城的担子上買的。一共買了十六隻，花了四萬元，每隻值價二千五百元。我怪她買得太多也太貴了·她說：「這是孵出來的，不比火炕鶢，只要千把塊或幾百元一隻，火炕的，不容易養大，孵出來的，自然，活潑，有趣。貴一點，也很值得買。」</p>
<p>我笑着說：「你眞是不怕麻煩，你難道養鶢還沒有養厭嗎？我替你想想也就够頭痛的了！」</p>
<p>她說：「一點也不！你看牠們這黃絨般的毛，小島般的姿態，怪疼人的！再說，看着牠們一天天的長起來，為了生趣，也是不妨養着玩兒的。」</p>
<p>「生趣？玩兒？我還記得你為了小鶢小鴨流淚的事，難道流淚也有趣也好玩兒的嗎？」我說了之後，她不禁也笑了起來。</p>
<p>兩年前，我們在屯溪的鄉下，因為學校中有空曠的園地，水草很多，她便買了好幾十隻小鶢小鴨，飼養着，每天　做牠們的保姆，趕進趕出，篩碎米　小鷄，撈浮萍提蚯蚓　小鴨，借鷄籠和鴨單，做牠們棲身的安逸窩。忙得非常起勁。小鷄小鴨們一天天向長起來，兩個月之後，小鶢已經快長翅膀，小鴨也會下水游泳，呷喋着自己尋食了。</p>
<p>每樣十隻，牠們雜在一起做朋友，鶢是見着小草便啄，一跳一跳地，鴨是伸着頭和喙，擺呀擺呀的向陰濕處亂鑽。一到晚上，妻便把牠們一一分着窠，讓牠們各自尋着不同的好夢去了。</p>
<p>不料有一天夜裏，我們上屯溪親戚家赴宴會，怕回校太遲，在他們那見寄宿了一宵，次日早上回來，遠遠地就遇見一個學生迎上來，給我們一個不愉快的報告，說所有小鶢，全被黃鼠狼拖走了，只有小鴨還是好好的。</p>
<p>我們走到放鶢鴨的小房間裏，果然發見籠裏的小鶢一隻也沒有了。</p>
<p>妻的懊喪自然是不用說了，又氣憤，又哀惋，噙着眼淚，把鷄窠送還了人家，放出小鴨，咻咻地在滿地上帶嗅帶滾，好像尋伴侶似地也在表示哀悼。</p>
<p>妻本來是偏愛小鷄的，她雖然也養着小鴨，却不很喜歡，因為養起來比較麻煩，而且小鴨也比小鷄更多屎溺太嫌骯髒了一些。因此便沒有心再養，把牠們一古腦都送給鄉下人了。</p>
<p>勝利後，我們改到一座山上的大學裏住家，她的偏嗜和趣味，又使她養起鶢來，山地裏養鷄眞太好了，一隻隻長大得非常快，幾個月中問，她養大了許多母鷄，都會生蛋，收起蛋來一雙一雙的收，因此我們每天早上都不愁沒有單點了。</p>
<p>也是在道個初夏的天中，不知從什麼地方跑來了一隻野貓，趁人不防備的時候，每天拖去一隻鷄，先只拖小的，後來速較大的也拖了，防不勝防，常常使我們從亂草　中發見了被殘害了的死鶴，頭子上被咬一口，血被吸去了，有時大腿上的肉被吃光，血肉糢糊地被謀害者擲下，變成悽慘的素屍。</p>
<p>她看見了這些慘象，又易於激動感情地流遇眼淚。</p>
<p>這些往事，使我為她這位好心的保護者擔憂，此次我不能不向她再下警告了。她說：「好了！這地方該再沒有黃鼠狼和野貓了！但願暗殺和殘害的事從此絕跡吧，」</p>
<p>說着，她把這次新買的十六隻小鷄，用一隻小網籃裝着，上蓋一方大毛巾，高高地弔在屋簷下的鐵鈎子上。每天晚上，她為小鶢們企禱平安，然後再悄悄地去睡自己的覺。</p>
<p>但願這位好心的保護者，這一次，再不至於遇到什麽陰謀和暗殺的兇手吧。</p>
<h3>琴韻</h3>
<p>— 楊達明</p>
<p>滑落一串尖音，把憶念寄在琴鍵上，綠色的音符有妳底笑語；我夢見會編織故事的軟紅的小口，和善淚的眸子。</p>
<p>空虛的心版上，曾描繪過一頁淡淡的藍色的讚美詩。忘了三月的桃花，五月的薔薇。我寫下妳髮際的溫馨和妳底悠悠的絮語</p>
<p>生命祗有年輕，因為有妳作伴和我長相守着這　色的鋼琴。妳那銀鈴的嗓音在我靈魂底深處開着紫色的花朶。我聽取妳靈魂的獨語。</p>
<p>在月下的琴畔，妳為我訴說着羅蜜歐與朱麗葉的故事。淡綠色的燈光下我做着夢寐似的沉思，我沉默：因為我有過太多哀傷的故事。</p>
<p>於是，妳沒有把這旖旎的故事說下去，妳開始感到寂寞，妳底眼眶裏濕潤着失望的淚水。</p>
<p>於是，妳要求我訴說出我心蘊的哀緒，好讓妳為我負担一部份心靈的寂鬱。但是我回答妳以無言，因為我不願在妳潔白的心胸上畫下深　的陰影。我輕輕地抹着琴鍵把寂鬱的哀緒寄在，＂One　day　when　we　were　young＂上。</p>
<p>見到妳晶瑩的跟波，該是一個美麗的世界呵！有時因女人的脂粉而燃起我靑春的火花，有時因一個褪色的故事而使我落淚終宵。——終於我底哀戚的淚水滅息了我靑春的火花。為着妳靑春的健康，我該離開這　色的琴畔，我不忍蠶蝕妳底容顏。讓我們寫下純潔懇摯的友誼的一頁，留在迢遙的日子裏作友情的憶念。</p>
<p>沒有故事，沒有詩篇，……；</p>
<p>滑落一串尖音，把憶念寄在琴鍵上，綠色的音符有妳底笑語。惟是我底手指已將變成化石。</p>

<h3>「洛神賦」與甄后　文學史上一個小問題</h3>
<p>— 湯</p>
<p>曹植那篇傳誦人口的名作「洛神賦」，在傳說中是認為發抒他對嫂子—曹丕之后甄氏的一段戀情，所謂「感甄」而寫的，這傳說幾乎和賦篇本身的流傳同其廣度。放這傳說的最初記錄，是唐代李善「文選」註裏引的「記日」，原文是：</p>
<p>「魏東阿王（植）漢末，求甄逸女不遂，太祖（操）回與五官中郎將（丕），植殊不平，晝思夜想，廢　忘食。黃初中入朝，帝（丕）示植甄后王縷金帶枕，植見之，不覺泣下。時已為郭后譛死，帝意尋悟，因留太子（植）宴飮，乃以枕賣植。植還……將息洛水上，思甄后，忽見女來，自云：『我本托心君王……」言訖不　見所在，遂遺人戲珠於王，王答以玉珮，悲喜不能自勝，遂作感甄賦。後明帝（后子）見之，改為洛神賦。」要是這位八斗之才的曹植生命史中眞有這件公案，倒也不失為一段佳話；但，若是假的，就未免厚誣古人了。而我們却證明這故事確是出於好事者的點染附會的。</p>
<p>就這記載的本身看，就支離破碎，恍惚依稀得令人難信。以曹丕之尊。而了無來由的把亡后之枕示弟寶弟已不合常情；而植竟對之泣下，更難為事實所許；何况故事後段寫甄后倐而來，忽而往，像是鬼，然而獻珠答珮，又像是人，這不明明自己招供在揑造嗎？這故事在陳壽「三國志」和裴松之詳徵博引的三國志註裏，都無隻字提及，這是正史，自可不論。劉宋時劉義慶的「世說新語」，是部記載魏晋間遺間軼事的櫂威小說，所記曹氏父子的事蹟也很多，在惑溺篇里甚至還叙述了曹丕取甄后的經過，但對這故事却未連類而及。梁劉孝標給它作註，引徵極為詳博，也沒一字涉及。被譽為「收佳事佳話，極為精彩」的這部書，竟沒記入這樣一個絕妙佳話，這正可證明在二劉之前還沒有這傳說，或是有這傳說而他們認為不可靠。</p>
<p>據三國「魏志」，甄后生於光和五年（公元一八二）而曹值生在初平三年（一九二），小於甄后十歲。曹操入鄴曹丕獲甄后——后本袁熙妻，操破鄰時丕得之——是在建安九年（二〇四），那時曹植正是十三歲，以一個十三歲的孩子，因為哥哥得去了比自己大十歲的已婚女子而「不平」，已屬奇蹟；抑且「晝思夜想，廢寢忘食」，更是匪夾所思了。</p>
<p>曹植入朝，還而作賦，是在黃初四年，看正史的記戴，這正是曹丕猜忌壓抑曹植和其他諸王無微不至的時際，植去見帝時，因為前二年曾因監國謁者布指奏發過他「醉酒悖慢，刦脅使者」，所以自承罪過，「科頭負鈇鑽，徒跣，帝猶嚴顏色，不與語，又不使冠履。」植伏地泣涕，還是因太后不樂，帝才許他復王服的。見帝後辭闕東歸，曹植與弟白馬王彪要想同路偕行，以叙契闊，而監國使者也還不許（不是帝的授意就是使者的希指），植就發憤告別，做了滿含悲鬱的贈白馬王彪詩七首。在這兩事之間，曹丕居然親暱得示枕賫枕，這是可能的嗎？</p>
<p>再就賦篇的本身說，它「翩若驚鴻，婉若游龍……」那一大段出神入化的文章所描繪出的女子，眞是祇應天上才有。而據「三國志」載，甄后在黃初二年六月因為失意有怨言被曹丕賜死時，已是四十歲，而她的兒女也已駸駸成人了。要說二年後植制洛神賦寫得那樣風神曼妙　麗絕倫的洛神就是影射的她，這也是很難令人置信的。</p>
<p>那麽，這賦究竟何為而作的呢？何義門說：「離騷經云，「吾令豐隆乘雲兮，求宓妃之所在。」植旣不得於君，因濟洛川以作此賦，托辭宓妃（伏羲之女，溺死洛水，後有洛神。），寄心文帝，其亦屈子之志也！」這說法固然有些歷來美人比君王，芳草擬君子的陳腐氣，但證之以作賦前後曹植不得於君的史實，同時在沒有其他更可靠的說法之前，還是比較可信的。</p>
<p>無怪淸人丁晏要指那李善引的所謂「記」是「小說短書」，也並斥李善的「本　麗無議，而妄引之耳」了。</p>
<h3>花鳥</h3>
<p>— 徐慶雲</p>
<p>（擬宋院本）</p>
<h3>無名的小藍花</h3>
<p>— 李蔚初</p>
<p>那是一個睛天，淸晨，我從陽公橋向小龍坎走去。空氣不消說是新鮮的，晨光和天色，有一種說不出的新生的美麗；荒郊的野景，更是新鮮可愛！公路的兩旁，遍是無垠的綠草和稻田，在那片碧綠的草色中，距我的視線不　，我忽地看見了一朵小小的，小得可愛的藍花，在那片綠色中、她招引我走近，細看：那是一種天藍，但是，那種天藍，是多麽別緻，多麼雅潔，又多麼甜賓的夭藍呀！但，誰也不知道呀！我環顧左右，只地孤零的一朶，附近再沒有與她相同的第二朶花。我看着她那美麗而孤零的小影，我的心不由充滿了愛憐。曠野是大的，綠色是深廣的，風吹兩打，無情的，折，是可怕。說不定黑夜中還有野獸的踐踏，摧殘。我忽有一種警悟：想到人；一個孤獨的須要自立的女孩，生活在險惡的人海裏，美麗或許就會招惹不幸，智慧也許就是痛苦的根源。我不由輕輕的數了一口氣。</p>
<p>「多多可愛，又多多可憐憫阿！」</p>
<p>我便想折了她，好好的帶回家去，安挿在我案頭的瓶中，保護她，珍惜她；讓我的眞心溫暖，慰籍她，把我的感情栽培她，滋潤她。但當我的手指剛才伸出，忽然又一種意念湧上我的心頭：</p>
<p>「當她離開了根，斷絕了泥土中的養份，豈不是為了愛她反把她　弱的生機送向夭亡嗎！」於是我那伸出的手指便無力的縮回了。</p>
<p>「啊，是了，上帝是叫她這麼生長的，造物對她是這麼安排的，她的命　註定就是生長在這裏，生長在這兒的曠野，這兒的泥土裏呀。」</p>
<p>這多想，於是我只好任憑她獨自而孤零的生活在那裏；我走了，我邁開了脚步，眷戀而不拾的走了。誰也不知進對於我自已的心，我的愛　和忍心，是多麼深遠的悲哀！在那漫長的　路上，我心裏默念着這樣的句子：</p>
<p>小藍花！</p>
<p>你的甜蜜的笑臉</p>
<p>美麗的天藍</p>
<p>很使我歡喜！</p>
<p>雖然，你獨自一朶的</p>
<p>那片幾綠中，</p>
<p>你是孤獨的，</p>
<p>可是我，小藍花！</p>
<p>却從你可愛的小臉上</p>
<p>看見生命單純的美麗，</p>
<p>小藍花！</p>
<p>那不用什麽憐憫和愛撫的……</p>
<p>這或者是對於我自己的一種無可奈何的自慰吧？——小藍花！你的靈魂又怎麽能化為女神來在我面前，解釋而且回答我呢！</p>
<p>三十二，七，六，重慶。</p>
<h3>補壁詩鈔</h3>
<p>— 北海</p>
<p>過佛羅倫斯</p>
<p>等閑曾到古名都，一派谿山入晝圖；急水帶沙風颯颯，高林浮翠烏呼呼；凄凉神曲千秋在，綺麗花城此日殊，賸欲下車訪遺迹，數聲離笛落平蕪。</p>
<p>半生故國同衰廢，兩日輕車作壯遊；駕壁峯頭看濁世，鶼官湖畔狎沙鷗；暫憑名釀當黃酒，準學齊優勝楚囚；可奈栖栖復行役，異鄉何可久淹留？</p>
<p>香港即事</p>
<p>再過香江十六年，好風吹夢落親前；家緣世亂無橡影，身似蓬飄到海邊；豈不懷歸畏書簡，更多惆悵入詩篇；此行總不關興廢，白馬投荒又未然。</p>
<p>渡黃河</p>
<p>疏里寒影照黃河，我馬　頹感逝波；投筆自煩今日事，等閑應是百年多；佳人難勤燕然石，壯七寗還易水歌；遙想粧臺詩在手，一鞭吾已渡　沱！</p>
<p>北海兄將入京，題詩留別，予愛其暫法之秀與討力之深，張諸素壁。越日，一樵先生過訪，而北海兄已去白下，忽覩壁上詩，如對故人，即馳書道念，並深致讀賞。上列過佛罷倫斯諸篇，率皆信口成詠，意隨筆轉，淸向墨流，飄逸有致，讀之令人深入海國，正不必遠涉水都花城方能領略也。三十六年六月孟農錄而識之。</p>
<h3>愛情及其他</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>愛情</p>
<p>一齣鑼鼓喧天的戲，夾在中間的想擠到外面來，外面的又想擠了進去。於是，四周一團混亂，擠出來的如同一羣無家可歸的流浪人在街頭徬徨，擠了進去的努力着向前。台上那穿得花花綠綠的以迷人的眼光向人兜送笑臉，鑼鼓緊敲着；</p>
<p>但是，喧譁聲終不似先前那麽起勁了。以後，只剩下一副破舊的行頭，幾根木棒。</p>
<p>沙漠中的在風吹來，使人不能睜大了眼，但足以使人沁入心脾。</p>
<p>歡喜</p>
<p>夜，一個沒有月亮也沒有星星的夜晚，夜行者在等待着一些指示路途的光芒。</p>
<p>夜行者是辛苦的，常會在深谷中迷失了路途，但是，他終於到達了「希望」。</p>
<p>夜行者多了，走不通的路也變成康莊大道了，我們現在都行走在他們走過的道路。</p>
<p>都市</p>
<p>夜晚，都市含蓄着荒淫與　恥。霓虹燈閃着奧秘而謠媚的光芒，　廳，酒吧間裏傳出一些悠揚的音樂聲來。</p>
<p>爵士樂是够使人忘懷一切的。</p>
<p>你懷着一顆躍　欲路的心不是？</p>
<p>但是，大公司的旁邊倒臥着一羣乞丐，幾個老而患病的發出一些低喘的呻吟……</p>
<h3>樹</h3>
<p>— 老凱</p>
<p>我的門前有顆不知名的樹，這生日子，　已是繁茂到不能再緊茂的程度了。常曉風細細的淸平，它搖幌着腦袋，搖亂了一頭未經梳理的濃厚的長髮。</p>
<p>炎午，它緘默着，偶而也在金黃色的陽光下發出嘆息似的輕喘。睡意來了，它便沒精打彩地從人行道上躺下一堆蔭影；疲倦的蔭影呵，彷彿還蒸發出炊烟一般的蒼白的熱氣。</p>
<p>當黃昏悄然走來，它那高大而又臃腫的身形，便塗抹了朦朧的憂鬱的黑色，這時，與其說它像一座尖塔在向四方窺探，倒毋寗說它像是一個穿了黑喪服的鬼巍的幽靈。</p>
<p>每天，我倚門凝視着它，我獨自從它旁邊漫步。由于相見的頻繁，遂乃自然而然地與它發生一種親切之感。</p>
<p>有一次，我正從它旁邊走過時，忽發見它的頂上簌簌地堕下幾片黃葉來。起初，我頗有些　疑——如今已是夏天啦！之後，也就恍然明白了：這是「新陳代謝」的道理，新生的葉代替了殘存的葉底位置，也便是殘存的葉被新生的葉排擠了。它，是一種新的生命的蛻變。</p>
<p>我抬起頭，望望那些深綠的瀾而肥的華，稠密得就像一蓬傘；我再俯下臉，看看那些枯憔　久已失去生命顏色的葉，無聲地躺在泥土里，通一絲掙扎的力量也沒有。這樣，我不禁被引起一種殘忍的快感；而且，聯想到很通遠的事情上去。</p>
<p>方生的快生，未死的快死吧，</p>
<p>這顆樹，還顆不知名的樹，該是一個有力的象徵，該是一個齡嫩的但却不易掛折的希望呵！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>台灣歷史二三事</h3>
<p>— 赤父</p>
<p>偉大人物鄭成功</p>
<p>合灣的歷史，是明代延平王鄭成功創造的，關於鄉成功的紀載很多，最重要的，有黃宗羲「賜姓始末」，許崇基「鄭成功年譜」，余宗信「明延平王台灣海國記」，江日昇「台灣外記」。在日人統治台灣五十年，日人搜羅了很多關於鄭氏的史材，現都珍藏在台灣，無人盤理，殊覺遺憾。</p>
<p>台灣信奉鄭氏，如信仰宗教一樣，大小城市皆建有廟祠，耙念這一偉大人物。合北市「延平王鄭成功購」現有一聯絕佳，聯日：「由秀才封王，柱持半璧舊河山，為天下讀書人頓生顏色。驅外夷出境，開闢千秋新世界，願中國有志者再鼓雄風。」</p>
<p>唐景崧台灣民主國</p>
<p>一八九五年（光緒廿一年甲午）李鴻章簽了馬關條約，台灣割讓於日本，消息傳到台灣後，人民悲憤欲絕，台灣巡撫唐景崧頗不滿淸室喪權辱國，於是台灣共舉唐為大總統，防務總辦劉水福副之，是年五月二日成立台灣民主國，年號永淸，製國旗，藍地黃虎長方五幅，虎首內向，尾高首低。民主國成立，唐景崧親擬一篇成立佈告，這篇佈告文字充滿了血和淚，為中國講民主獨立的最早一篇文獻。</p>
<p>唐景崧是廣西人，他受合灣人的擁護，足徵台灣過去並不排外，台灣民主國前後僅有十二天的歷史，日人武力即長驅直入台灣；可是台人堅苦不拔的意志，迄今未稍姦。今人張君勱，蔣勻田，曾在廣西創辦有「景崧中學」，便是紀念這偉大的民主英雄的。</p>
<p>丘逢甲的非憤</p>
<p>當台灣民主國成立前，奔走呼籲而力竭聲嘶，並積極主張獨立的，是台人丘逢甲氏。這是一位才華並茂的智士，為人耿介。日軍佔據台灣後，丘逢甲狼狽離台，曾賦詩六首，表現悲憤，表現愛國，表現復仇，並表現淡泊，表現寗靜，後人應該把它當作文獻讀，當作好文學看，茲抄離台詩六首全文於後：</p>
<p>「宰相有權能割地，孤臣無力可回天，扁知去作鴟夷子，國首河山意黯然！</p>
<p>虎韜豹略且收藏，休說承明執戟郎，至竟虬髯成底事，宮中一矩類咸陽。</p>
<p>捲土重來未可知，江山亦要偉大持；成名賢子知多少，海上誰來建義旗？</p>
<p>從此中原恐陸沉，東周積弱又於今；入山冷眼觀時局，荊棘銅駝感慨深。</p>
<p>英雄退步即神仙，火氣消除道德篇；我不神仙聊劍陜，仇頭斬盡再升天。</p>
<p>亂世團圓骨肉難，弟兄離別正心酸；奉親且作漁樵隱，到處名山可掛單。」</p>
<p>這是多麼感情豐富，充滿民族意志的詩篇啊！台灣人五十年的革命奮鬥，正是「捲土重來未可知，江山亦要偉人持」底昭示啊！</p>
<h3>舊詩抄</h3>
<p>— 海若</p>
<p>「久旱逢甘雨，他鄉遇故知；洞房花獨夜，金榜題名時。」此詩流傳甚廣，事事可喜，因有人題其名為四喜詩。又名得意詩。</p>
<p>明隆慶戊辰科，侯官溫正春以教官登第館選。一日與山陰王對南相值，王因舉上詩以戲之，謂四喜只五言，未足為喜，當各添二字。日：「十年久畢逢甘雨，萬里他鄉遇故知；和尚洞房在燭夜，」語未完，溫公大笑曰：「下句英非「教官金榜題名時」乎？」聞者哄堂。</p>
<p>又有好事者，相反　一律，題曰失意詩。句為」寡歸携兒泣，將軍被敵擒；失恩宮女面，下第舉人心。」是悲喜之狀，誠大不相同矣。</p>
<p>古代為官，須以科舉出身，方為正途。故有謂「三十老明經，五十少進士」者，可見其艱難之一般。</p>
<p>淸代有童生年且七十，猶未入學，督學法某憫其老，於是恩給一秀才。並作寶塔歌曰：「翁，古童，時運通，白髮蓬鬆，是太公的令令兄。」語雖譃，亦可見科塲中之辛酸也。</p>
<h3>新中文打字機</h3>
<p>— 大明</p>
<p>由於英文打字機的發明，使他們節省了不少人力和時間。使我們也想起設計一架中文打字機，來代替公事房成千成萬的抄字員。但是漢字是些單個的方塊，不像西文是由字母併合起來，所以很困難。而且漢字數目很多，按中文電報局的電碼本子上有九千多字，平常字典裏就一萬多字，大學字典就有一萬五千多字，假使鑄成鉛字放在打字機上是不可能的。假使分成左右上下各塊來湊合筆劃而大小要受限制。許多經過國內很多人的研究，到現在還沒有完全令人滿意的打字機出來，不過最近在林語堂博士指導下設計的一架比校要進步的多</p>
<p>遠在民國十八年，商務印書館的周厚坤先生曾將鉛字裝在一隻活動的桶中，仿效日本打字機方法打，當又經王雲五先生和燕京大學的洪維廉先生的改良，它有一個裝有普通二千五百印刷鉛字的盤，打字員對這個盤要背的很熟，不然打起來還不及寫的快呢。</p>
<p>三十四年在林博士領導卞，在美國設計的這架中文打字機現在用的很多，商務印書館還未出品。他首先放棄用中國一般字典的索引來分類，完全以目綫為標準，不管其筆劃是否最先或最後寫，機字上有三十六隻　鎖（Keys）表字的首部（最高），廿八叟欺鎖代表字的末部（最低）。育部和末部合併有一千零八類不同的配合，每類中平均有四個字。要打時　下了字的首部和字的末部，便使機器上的一「窗」口顯出這兩　鎖相配所能包含的字樣，此「窗」中還指出此字在類字中的地位。機器地下有八個印字鎖，就照字在窗中的地位在印字鎖上打。旣然有一千零八類，每類就有一個「第一位」，就第一位的字就是最常用的字了。記不熟的人還可看着窗口打。假使有左右兩旁的字就左右分打，其餘全字打。機字內共有六千隻鉛字，裝在長六寸三分，直徑四寸五分的圓柱裏，鉛字排圈在這圓柱中的六個活動的小長圓柱上。當撳下撳鎖時，即能把柱上任何字移到印字地位。有左旁的字須要歡五次，其餘撳三次。但當用的不是左右旁併成的，例如「我」「人」「為」「立」「坐」「來」「去」「水」「天」「團」「家」「弟」「兄」「文」……等等有七百多個。其他有三百個常用的左右旁的字也是全字打「三次」。譬如總理遺　有一百四十五個字，只有二十五個字有左右旁，但其中僅有三個需要左右打「五次」，其餘一百四十二個字就是全打了。</p>
<p>機字上共有八千個空位置，除了這六千鉛字，二千餘數是準備加上英文字母，（和幾個特異俄法文字母）日文字母，和中國古書上極少見的字的。這樣這個打字機算是完全了，打字員可用兩手同時　下首部及末部的鎖，然後，再打下印字鎖，鎖也同使紙上進一格，直的橫的皆可，不但比起英文打字機來，缺點很多，不够快，不容易熟練，但這是工程上的問題，我們很希望有志之士多多研究，將來會有更進步的打字機出現。</p>
<h3>「自由」談</h3>
<p>— 小童</p>
<p>羅素說：「一個國家沒有自由，就不能好好地存在。」柏爾林·勃洛克又說：「自由對團體，猶如健康對於個人的身體一樣，沒有健康，人們就沒有快樂可以享受，沒有自由，社會也就沒有快樂可以享受了。」世界上每一個人，大家都可以有事受自己做人的特權，人們都需要自由，沒有人願意自己自由的特權，被剝奪。歷史上多少弱小民族，忍受着最大的痛苦，鍛鍊成鋼鐵堅張的意志，總於怒吼·反抗·由革命的血淚中，爭回自由的特壇。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦歐</p>
<p>「好！我們推舉老處！」</p>
<p>但盧前竭力推却，任憑怎多勸也不答應．最後，老祝對他這樣說：</p>
<p>「老盧，從前大家都笑你太悲觀，只會發牢騷，只會嘆氣，你常常感到這是一種侮辱。今天，到了今天，你還不想證明你自己不是一個懦怯的悲觀主義者嗎？」</p>
<p>這幾句話才把盧跛子激動了。</p>
<p>「好！可是我有幾句話先要說。」他的臉漲得通紅，有些與奮過度，最初的機句話，期期艾艾的簡直說不出來。「如果你們眞要舉我做領隊的話，那我根本就不願意領着大家，老像這樣喪家之犬似的逃難！」</p>
<p>他的話驚動了每一個人，二三十雙限睛全集中在他那一張怪平凡的臉上。</p>
<p>「我們也是人，也是堂堂大國民。像這樣給人家追得望影而逃，我本來早就受不住了！人生自古誰無死要。為什麽我們　東　鬼怕得這個樣子，並且像我們這樣旣沒有組織，又沒有血氣的民族，任憑你逃到什麽地方去，人家還是會追來的！　道你們眞想逃上喜馬拉亞山去？」</p>
<p>幾年來　積在盧前胸中的惡氣，今天倒眞發洩了一個痛快；祝兆年側着臉，默然微笑，暫時忘掉了邀的一切。</p>
<p>「以前祇有我們跟日本鬼拚命，打不過還勉強說得過去，現在已有人家來帮忙了，而我們還是這樣的不爭氣！」他舉起了一條握拳透爪的手臂，在頭頂上揮舞着，像一位出色的演說家一樣。「抗戰抗到今天，我們仍然寸土未復，還要死爭面子，滿口疏散，轉進，撤退，搶運，……不肯說一個敗字，簡直不要臉！……」</p>
<p>站上那許多客人也漸漸擁到了他們的周　來。</p>
<h3>鄒月嫦案及其他</h3>
<p>— 盧丹</p>
<p>江蘇吳江同里鎭女敎員鄒月娥被姦致死案，目前已　動全國，聽說吳江婦女團體還楊向最高當局呈訴，該鎭曾經一度罷市，小學生聽到老師如此慘死，也都又驚又怕又憤，據日昨大公報載，當地已捕獲穿制服的嫌疑犯三名，軍官總隊隊長還下了命令，準備嚴懲橫行不　乙人員。這事情鬧大了，雖然暴露了兇手們的惡行，使全國女性不禁為鄒月娥的慘死同聲一哭，但紙是包住不火的，作為一個典型的姦殺案看，從而加以研究，設法防備類似的慘劇發生於其他各處，嚴懲兇手，以免讓刁民有例可援，等等，倒是更必要的吧。</p>
<p>若能如此，則一個鄒月娥的死，爭取了十百個鄒月娥的生，在鄒月娥本人　，她雖死不瞑目，畢竞也替同陷在泥沼中的姊妹們尋覓到一條　　紈袴子的逃路</p>
<p>在獸性泛濫的人問，女性的命運原是可悲的。彼姦，被殺，被劫，被販賣，被侮辱，……這就是大多數女性的「義務」。在若干地區。一個女孩的身價，也許還抵不到二三斤豬肉價，最可憐的還是稍有幾分姿色的弱者，她們像貨物一樣，成為人們的掠奪品，紈袴子和登徒子是不允許身邊有一個貞女」的，他們有特種嗜好，敢於遠抗他們的人並不多，何况你只是一個弱女子。鄒月娥是一個極富自尊心的女性，而這「自尊心」，恰巧是登徒子們極端憎厭的，因此也便成為鄒月娥被殺的主要原因。「不能以力爭取，便不惜于以破壞」，同里鎭慘案中的兇手對於這教條可謂信守不渝了。</p>
<p>和同里鎭慘案差不多而結果並不相似的是義烏南區培磊鎭某中隊長施某持槍逼姦弱女子楊春華案。楊春華雖已逃出虎窟，並向報界提出呼籲，獲得義烏警察局長，縣長，靑年團書記諸當地當政要人的同情，然而仍無濟于事。「日前該女家屬以不堪男方威脅，趕來縣城，由年遂七十之老外婆及親生母向女跪懇，諸願及全家生命而忍辱……」楊春華子是又重入虎口了。</p>
<p>一個小小的中隊長，想不到竟有那多大的權勢，這情形是說明了「武器第一」呢，還是證實了中國的封建殘餘勢力尚未可輕視？</p>
<p>A·耙德在「偽幣製造者」中談及海中水族的故事：</p>
<p>「有幾種魚在太鹹或太淡的水中就不能生存，而另幾種魚正相反，它們能適應水的各　　度，它們就守候在鹹度較低的水流邊，等着那些不能支持的魚　　來時全把它們吞了。……」</p>
<p>海中水族如此，人類竟亦不能例外，中隊長施某之流也不邊是一條較能適應中國封建情形的狡魚而已。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Northern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, National Army Continues to Advance South, Coastal Line of Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu Under Blockade</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 16th] Communist forces outside Tianjin began plotting to disturb the city from the 14th. The authorities have increased troop deployments for strict defense and have completed arrangements. The Communist forces' conspiracy to harass has been thwarted. This morning, on the 16th, a large number of National Army troops arrived in Tianjin for reinforcement, and public morale is trending towards peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping Dispatch, 16th] It is reported that over ten thousand troops under Fu Zuoyi arrived in Tianjin from Chahar on the 16th to reinforce the defense. After the troops arrived, they immediately set up defensive fortifications outside the city.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 16th] Official confirmation: The war on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is still raging. It is confirmed that Cangxian County was invaded by Communist forces on the night of the 13th. The defending troops broke through and retreated to the suburbs. National Army reinforcements coming south from Tianjin counterattacked yesterday and re-entered the city. Furthermore, Cangbei Qingxian, Chen Guantun, Tang Guantun, Xingji and other places have been harassed by Communist forces fleeing north since yesterday and fierce fighting is also underway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch, 16th] According to this morning's air force reconnaissance, the national flag with a white sun on a blue sky still flies high over Cangxian County.</p>

<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 16th] As the battle on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway progresses, the National Army is advancing south from Chen Guantun. This morning, the 16th, a large number of National Army reinforcements were dispatched from southern Tianjin. The situation south of Chen Guantun is chaotic. The train line from Tianjin to Jinghai is clear.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping Dispatch, 16th] Tianjin authorities today officially acknowledged receiving orders from the government to blockade the line from Tanggu to Shanghai, covering the coasts of Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces. It is widely believed that the purpose of this measure is to prevent large sailboats carrying supplies and soldiers from Dalian from flowing into Shandong. According to unofficial sources, Dalian is a base for disrupting the National Army because Communist forces are using the area as a supply station, capable of sending reinforcements to obstruct the National Army's hopes of reopening the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. In other news, the Tianjin Public Utilities Bureau has received a notice from the naval authorities to prepare berths for Chinese warships. China recently acquired nine minesweepers from the United States. Meanwhile, the situation in Tianjin is tense. Troops are patrolling the streets in military trucks, and guards are stationed for the first time in the street corner fortifications built last year. Workers are digging trenches on the south side of the city. The curfew, which began at 10:00 PM, has entered its third day today. Despite these signs of a state of military affairs, it is generally believed that Tianjin and Peiping remain safe.</p>

<h3>Nine Japanese Soldiers in Communist Army Captured, Escorted from Shenyang to Peiping, Claimed They Were Detained and Forced into Service While Awaiting Repatriation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 16th] A unit of the New Sixth Army captured nine Japanese in the Communist army in Zhonggu (near Shenyang, 30 kilometers away) and has escorted them to Peiping for interrogation. According to their statements, they belonged to the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the Communist army. Six months ago, they were detained by the Communist army while gathered in Dunhua awaiting repatriation and were forced to serve as stretcher bearers. This time, they departed from Fuyu to fight in Kaiyuan. Taking advantage of the Communist army's northward deployment, they deserted about 30 kilometers north of Kaiyuan and surrendered to the National Army. The Communist army treats Japanese and Koreans equally. The stretcher team leader is Chinese, the deputy leader is Korean, and among the 30 team members, 29 are Japanese. Seven out of ten of the Communist army's artillerymen are Korean, all of whom voluntarily came to the Northeast to participate. They all knew that only after escaping to our side would they have the possibility of being repatriated, so they dared to take the risk to surrender. The names of the nine Japanese are as follows: (1) Yoshio Matsumura (2) Kisuke Ki (3) Hiroshi Mitsuno (4) Kakuzo Daiji (5) Kakuten Shibutani (6) Teruhiko Yamamoto (7) Kiyoshi Takahashi (8) Tsukasa Oki (9) Tadashi Hashimoto.</p>
<h3>Yongtai Warship Bloodshed</h3>
<p>En Route from Huludao to Qingdao, a Ship Affairs Officer Shoots the Captain</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 16th] A bloody tragedy of a ship affairs officer shooting the captain occurred on the Yongtai warship of the First Northern Patrol Fleet on its return trip from the Northern Patrol to Qingdao. It was revealed today by related parties that on the afternoon of the 8th, as the ship was passing Huludao and approaching Haimen Island, Ji Rui, the newly appointed ship affairs officer, took out a pistol and fired into the crowd in the officer's quarters, first killing Zheng Jia, the original ship affairs officer, and then shooting Captain Li Yu.

Ji then jumped into the sea to kill himself, but was rescued by the ship. He is now nervous and constantly muttering curses. The ship has now sailed to Qingdao, and the injured personnel have been hospitalized for treatment. The murderer Ji Rui has been sent to the military court for trial. Ji and the deceased were classmates. Ji reported for duty in March of this year and was originally intended to replace the deceased. Ji is usually silent and seems to have a mental disorder.</p>
<h3>The Soviet and Mongolian Governments Give Indirect Responses to Our Government's Protest, Moscow Broadcasts Statement from Outer Mongolia Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Soviet and Mongolian sides have not yet sent a written reply to our protest regarding the Xinjiang incident, apart from making indirect responses in broadcasts. Reporters from various newspapers have been inquiring at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs every day, but the only answer they received was: "This Ministry has not yet received any written reply." They refused to disclose whether we will lodge another protest. According to a senior government official, the authorities are handling the Xinjiang affair with solemnity and are still studying whether to lodge another protest.</p>
<p>[United Press, London Dispatch, 16th] A broadcast from Moscow Radio quoted a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic as saying: "Mongolian border guards were forced to repel Chinese troops who had crossed into Mongolian territory under the cover of aircraft." The radio station went on to deny Chinese reports of attacks on the Chinese border and denounced them as fabrications with a clear provocative intent.</p>
<p>According to the radio broadcast, the truth about the June 5th incident was that "a detachment of Chinese troops violated the border of the Mongolian People's Republic, deployed a sixteen-kilometer-long position in the Meirding Gol River (transliteration) area, dug trenches, and reinforced their troops while attacking a Mongolian border guard post. The commander of the Mongolian border guards sent personnel to meet with the Chinese military commander and demand that they withdraw from Mongolia, but was refused, and the envoy was detained. Therefore, the Mongolian border guards were forced to take measures to repel the invaders. A detachment of border guards, under the cover of several aircraft from the Mongolian Air Force, forced the invaders to withdraw from the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Mongolian border guards did not cross into Chinese territory when taking this military action. After the Chinese troops withdrew, the bodies of the Mongolian military envoy and four border guard soldiers were found in the Chinese military camp on June 9th, all with signs of severe torture. The Mongolian People's Republic has lodged a strong protest with the Chinese government and reserves the right to demand that the Chinese government severely punish the perpetrators and compensate Mongolia for the losses it has suffered."</p>
<h3>Moscow Broadcast Inconsistent with Facts</h3>
<p>Chenghua and Beitashan are All Chinese Territory</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] According to the Moscow broadcast received here, the Outer Mongolian side attributed the cause of the Xinjiang incident to our troops crossing the Outer Mongolian border. When reporters inquired about this with related parties, they were told: "Whether from a historical, geographical, or treaty perspective, Chenghua and the northeastern region of Beitashan are all within China's territory. The Moscow broadcast is completely inconsistent with the facts."</p>
<h3>China-Mongolia Border Demarcation Issue May Be Negotiated in Moscow</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] According to predictions from official sources here, China and the Mongolian People's Republic will face a protracted and unpleasant diplomatic dispute over the demarcation of the northern Xinjiang border where the recent conflict occurred. A Moscow radio broadcast citing a statement from the Outer Mongolian Foreign Minister claimed that Chinese troops crossed into Mongolian territory on June 5th. These remarks presage that the Xinjiang border demarcation issue will go through many complicated negotiations. The negotiation location may be in Moscow. China insists that Beitashan, where the conflict occurred, is 200 miles inside Chinese territory, while the Outer Mongolian side is said to claim that the Chinese border should be moved south of Beitashan. It is said that there are abundant mineral deposits such as coal, gold and uranium there. Officials were very uneasy about Outer Mongolia's demands as stated in the Moscow broadcast. According to them, in the past, when Outer Mongolia was still considered part of China, Beitashan was 200 miles inside Chinese territory according to the Xinjiang provincial border of China. Officials also said that Outer Mongolia has not yet raised this issue with the Chinese Embassy in Moscow. Although China recognizes the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic, it has not yet established diplomatic relations, so any negotiations on this matter must be conducted by diplomatic representatives of China and Mongolia in Moscow. However, Chinese officials predict that in future border negotiations, the Chinese government will insist on the original border lines on the map issued by the Ministry of Interior in 1940 (six years before the recognition of Outer Mongolia's independence).</p>
<p>[Local News] The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Youth Construction Association sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang regarding the Xinjiang incident, stating, "Outer Mongolia recklessly raises troops, and all of us Chinese are furious. Please quickly pacify them to secure the country."</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Hong Lanyou told reporters on the 16th that the universal election will be held as scheduled.

<p>[Report from Shenyang by this newspaper on the 16th] During the major battle to capture Siping on the 15th, the National Army encountered a severe crisis. However, due to the massive air force providing assistance day and night and the defending troops fighting valiantly, the communist forces that had invaded the city were driven out. The communist forces suffered considerable losses. With the cooperation of the army and air force, Siping overcame this difficult situation.</p>
<p>[Report from Shenyang by the Central News Agency on the 16th] Telephone report from Siping: Decisive battles began on the outskirts of Siping at 5 PM on the 14th. The communist forces launched intense artillery fire into the city from Xiaokagou in the west and Lingshenmiao in the south. Later that evening, they launched assaults on the south gate with shock troops, attacking every hour. The defending troops calmly responded, mowing down the attacking shock troops with machine gun fire. At midnight, 3,000 communist troops stormed into the city. The defending troops fought steadily and encircled them. Half of the communist troops surrendered, while the other part was annihilated. More than a hundred remained in a building resisting stubbornly, so the National Army bombed and destroyed the building. On the morning of the 15th, communist forces launched three fierce attacks on the southern suburbs, forcing National Army positions and invading the outer trenches, where hand-to-hand combat ensued. All of the communist forces were wiped out.</p>
<p>[Report from Changchun by the Central News Agency on the 16th] There were no large-scale battles in the suburbs of Siping on the night of the 15th, possibly a calm before a major storm. The Siping airfield in the western suburbs, which had been briefly captured, has been regained by the National Army. More than a thousand communist troops who had infiltrated the airfield were surrounded and annihilated.</p>
<p>[Another cable] The communist forces, with the main strength centered on the 1st and 2nd Columns under Wan Yi and Liu Zheng, combined with parts of the 3rd and 4th Columns and the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the Rehe-Liaoning Military Region, along with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Independent Divisions of the Heilongjiang and Songbei Military Regions, totaling about 70,000 troops (according to original troop strength numbers, these units numbered around 100,000, but lost a third of their forces during the offensive to Kaiyuan), and equipped with artillery and cavalry, attacked Siping from the west, south, and north. A portion of the 6th Column of communist forces that had moved eastward from Jilin stirred up trouble in the areas of Guojiadian and Dayushu between Siping and Gongzhuling, disrupting the National Army's actions.</p>
<p>[Report from Shenyang by the Central News Agency on the 16th] Telephone report from Benxi: More than 3,000 communist troops advanced on Benxi (60 kilometers from Shenyang) on the 13th, engaging the National Army in fierce fighting. Small groups of communist forces briefly broke into the city but were driven out. Fierce fighting between the two sides continued throughout the 14th. The National Army is steadily arriving in force, and the battle continues in the southern suburbs of Benxi.</p>
<p>[Report from Jilin by the Central News Agency on the 16th] Communist forces along the Jilin-Changchun Highway continue to harass the area. A portion, numbering about 600, is constantly attacking the National Army positions southeast of Soudeng Station. However, they have been suppressed by intense fire and have not succeeded. There are no changes in other areas outside Jilin City.</p>

<h3>Inauguration of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East; Chiang Ting-fu Elected Chairman; Soviet Representative Holds Dissenting Views Among All Country Representatives</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The first plenary meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East was solemnly inaugurated yesterday morning at 10:30 AM in the main dining room of the Hua Hotel. This is the first international conference convened in China by countries from around the world. Approximately 230 representatives and guests from ten countries, including China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, India, Australia, the Philippines, and others, along with reporters, were present. Among the guests were approximately one hundred people, including H.H. Kung, Yen Chung-ching, Tsai Chi-shu, Pan Kung-nung, Wang Hsiao-lai, Chen Kuo-lien, and Wang Jen-lin.</p>
<p>The seating arrangement in the conference room was horseshoe-shaped, with the chairman and key staff of the secretariat seated in the middle row, and the representatives of each country seated on either side. Behind the seat of each country's chief representative sat one or two advisors from the delegation. The secretaries and interpreters sat in the rear of the horseshoe-shaped arrangement. The official languages of the conference are English and French. Behind the seating, a banner with English gold lettering and the flags of nine countries were displayed. The flag of India was not yet confirmed, so it was temporarily not displayed.</p>
<p>The conference began at 10:30 AM, with the Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations, designated as the Secretary-General of the conference, giving a report on the preparation and significance of this conference, and explaining the scope and nature of the committee's work. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh was introduced to meet with the representatives, and Foreign Minister Wang delivered the opening address on behalf of the Chinese government (see below). The conference was then officially inaugurated.</p>
<p>After Foreign Minister Wang's speech, Mayor Wu delivered a welcome address (see below), followed by the opening address by Mr. Wovwen to the conference (see below). After the addresses, the election of the conference chairman began. Representatives from India, the United States, and the Soviet Union spoke successively, but as it was approaching noon, no decision was reached, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>The meeting resumed at 3 PM to continue the election of the conference chairman. Representatives from various countries jointly nominated Mr. Chiang Ting-fu, head of the Chinese delegation, as chairman. The Soviet representative alone expressed dissenting views, leading to nearly an hour of contention. The atmosphere in the conference room was momentarily tense. At 3:45 PM, it was finally passed by an absolute majority that Mr. Chiang serve as chairman of the conference. Mr. Chiang then moved from his seat in the Chinese delegation to the chairman's seat and delivered a speech to the entire assembly (recorded separately).</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Opening Address: Rapid Economic Recovery as a Condition for Peace and Victory; China is Willing to Assist the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East to Succeed</h3>
<p>Mr. Wovwen, distinguished representatives:</p>
<p>The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is an important organization of the United Nations. I feel very honored to have the opportunity to speak here today, because this is the first time that a meeting of this nature has been held in China.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to welcome all of you on behalf of the Chinese government. I also assure you that the Chinese government will do its best to assist you. I believe that all of you share the common aspiration to ensure the successful completion of this committee's important mission. The Chinese government is happy to see the realization of this aspiration, needless to say.</p>
<p>The establishment of this committee was based on the resolutions passed by the Council in December of last year. One of these resolutions entrusted this committee to "initiate and participate in various measures to facilitate the concentration of efforts to facilitate the reconstruction of the economies of Asia and the Far East, to raise the level of economic activity in Asia and the Far East, to maintain and strengthen relations between the members of the region and between the region and the rest of the world."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the task of this committee is broad in scope, yet also very clear. Your responsibilities are of utmost importance, and the issues you will deal with are also very urgent. As you discuss the rules of procedure and work plans here, hundreds of millions of displaced people are watching how you will design and decide. You will never let them down, because it is through their sacrifices that we have won the victory in the war. Only with their support can we achieve a victory of peace, and a rapid economic recovery is a condition for a victory of peace.</p>
<p>A year and ten months have passed since the Allied nations defeated Japan, but the dawn of global economic recovery has yet to appear. If the situation is like this throughout the world, it is especially so in Asia and the Far East.</p>
<p>Speaking of China, I would like to say frankly that we are still suffering from the severe threat of inflation and price volatility, just as we were during the war. Our ruined cities and ruined rural areas have not yet started reconstruction work. Our limited transportation lines have not been largely restored, and our overall production capacity has not been improved.</p>
<p>The delay in China's economic recovery is due to many reasons. Among these reasons, the vastness of the war-affected areas is the main reason. Most of the effort and time required for economic rehabilitation work depend on this. Since the situation is such, the wounds inflicted on China by our common enemy continue to bleed. The fundamental mission of the United Nations is to promote international peace and security. As for promoting world peace, the Charter of the United Nations has clearly recognized the creation of good economic conditions. Gentlemen, if world peace and world economic stability are inseparable, then the political stability of every war-torn country is also inseparable from the work of economic recovery. These two things are mutually causal and must go hand in hand. Currently, there are many regions within China that not only urgently need economic recovery work, but also have the potential to implement it. The same situation exists in other countries in Asia and the Far East. The economic recovery work in these regions should not wait until the political situation in their countries returns to normal before starting.</p>
<p>The "Working Group on Asia and the Far East" dispatched by the "Temporary Sub-Committee on Economic Reconstruction in War-Torn Areas" has expressed the view that the restoration of the global economic situation requires the cooperation of all relevant governments. This is a very honest and correct view. The victory of the last World War could not have been achieved by the power of one country alone. It is equally impossible for a country to lock itself within its borders and enjoy economic stability alone. Therefore, we must unite, formulate plans, and put the formulated plans into practice.</p>
<p>The Chinese side is prepared to assist in all the investigative work of this committee. We hope that this committee will draw up temporary emergency relief plans for the most affected areas, and formulate long-term reconstruction plans. China will also contribute as much as possible and cooperate fully to ensure the committee's genuine success. We want this committee to benefit Asia, the Far East, and even all the peoples of the world, and thereby enhance the authority of the United Nations itself.</p>
<p>I hope and believe that this committee will fulfill its responsibilities well, and a new and most important page will be added to the record of the United Nations.</p>

<h3>Wovwen's Opening Address</h3>
<p>In his opening address, Wovwen stated: The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is holding its first meeting in Asia. I deeply feel the historical importance of this meeting. On behalf of Secretary-General Lie of the United Nations, I extend my greetings to the representatives of all countries. The various issues to be reviewed at this meeting are related to the post-war economic recovery of more than half of the world's population. The main issue before this committee is to study how Asian countries can restore their pre-war economic vitality. Therefore, in reviewing various proposals, it seems inappropriate to make the scope of research too broad, wasting effort and failing to achieve practical results. If this committee can use the importance of each issue as a standard for evaluation, it will not be difficult to establish practical plans in a short period of time, and make all parties recognize that this committee is an organization based on practical work.</p>
<h3>Election of Chairman: A Scene of Debate; Soviet Representative's Dissenting Views Unsupported</h3>
<p>When the conference followed the second item on the agenda to elect a chairman yesterday morning, Nehru, the representative of India, first nominated Dr. Chiang Ting-fu as the first chairman. He also said, "Dr. Chiang has experience in our current work, and his advice and guidance will certainly help us establish a strong and effective organization. If we accept his leadership, our task will be much easier."</p>
<p>However, Soviet representative Stetsenko expressed dissent immediately after Mr. Nehru's speech. He said: "I propose that the election of the chairman should be determined only after the representatives of all countries have delivered their speeches. The Soviet delegation only arrived in Shanghai yesterday (referring to the day before yesterday) afternoon, and has not had sufficient time to consider the candidates for chairman. Therefore, I request that the election be postponed."</p>
<p>But U.S. representative Davis expressed support for Nehru's nomination. In addition to supporting the nomination of Chiang Ting-fu by the Indian representative, he also gave a detailed explanation of Mr. Chiang's extraordinary qualifications for this position.</p>
<p>After Mr. Davis finished speaking, Stetsenko still insisted that the election be postponed, repeatedly stating his views. As the time had exceeded 12:00 PM, the temporary chairman Wovwen announced that the discussion would continue at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>After the afternoon meeting began, the chairman reported that the conference chairman had been nominated by the Indian representative and seconded by the U.S. representative. Just as the matter was about to be put to a vote, Mr. Stetsenko spoke again, insisting that the representatives of the various countries speak first, and then the election be held. Afterwards, Filipino representative Cuaderno proposed that the discussion be terminated, and the chairman put Mr. Stetsenko's proposal to a vote, but no one seconded it. The chairman announced that Dr. Chiang Ting-fu would serve as the chairman of the conference, and then retired to the left of the chairman's seat, allowing Mr. Chiang to formally take his place.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative: Many Unique Dissenting Views</h3>
<p>After Chairman Chiang Ting-fu delivered his opening address at the conference yesterday afternoon, the third item on the agenda, regarding temporary rules of procedure, was discussed. British representative Crow suggested that the committee study and review the rules before submitting them to the conference for approval. At this time, Stetsenko again said: "I do not oppose the British representative's suggestion, but with regards to the fourth item, 'Election of Conference Officers,' I believe that it should not be as rushed and hasty as the previous election of the chairman. We should have time to consider it, so I suggest that the discussion be postponed."</p>
<p>When discussing the fourth item, Mr. Stetsenko once again proposed the idea of speaking first and then discussing it. He asked the chairman in an angry tone: "Do the Soviet representatives have equal rights with other representatives to express their opinions on proposals? Who should decide on the proposal? I would like the chairman to explain."</p>
<p>The chairman laughed and said: "I have no intention of deciding on any proposal. As the chairman of the meeting, my responsibility is to ensure that no representative feels that they have suffered a loss." Mr. Stetsenko replied: "I and the delegation from my country have indeed suffered a loss in the election of the chairman!"</p>
<p>Regarding the election of the conference officers, because several representatives also proposed discussing it today (the 17th), and the time was already past 5:00 PM, the chairman announced that the meeting would continue tomorrow morning and asked the representatives what time would be appropriate. Should the meeting be scheduled for 10:00 AM? But Mr. Stetsenko argued for 10:30 AM. It was then decided that the meeting would be held at 10:30 AM this morning.</p>

<h3>Resolving Economic Problems is Essential to Avert Political Difficulties: Chiang Ting-fu Delivers Speech After Election as Chairman</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Chiang Ting-fu, upon being elected Chairman of the Far East Economic Commission, expressed his gratitude to the representatives of various nations. He also delivered a speech as follows:</p>
<p>On March 3rd of this year, the Chairman of the Asian and Far Eastern Working Group of the Economic Council submitted a detailed analytical report, based on which the Asian and Far East Economic Commission was established. Although the report at the time could not encompass every detail, its viewpoint accurately captured the economic issues of Asia and the Far East. More importantly, the report pointed out that the economic maladies of Asia and the Far East were already quite prominent before the war. The points raised in that report are still worth reading today. For example, the report stated: "We must recognize that the revival of Asia and the Far East should not be narrowly predicated on restoring the pre-war state. Before the war, industrial development in Asia was merely a superficial embellishment, concealing outdated social structures. While there were new factories, mines, and modern cities, railways, and airports in various places, the general population continued to survive in extreme poverty and ignorance. This has led to the so-called 'dualistic' economic structure in various parts of Asia, where a portion of the population is engaged in modern production, while the majority struggles to survive using non-industrialized means."</p>
<p>The report further pointed out that "the progress of production and trade in Asia and the Far East is a major prerequisite for raising the global standard of living. If the world's nations can assist in Asia's recovery, its productivity and consumption will benefit the recovery of all nations." The points made in the report provide a basis for our examination. In my observation, the political situation in certain regions of Asia is the biggest obstacle to economic recovery. However, the political disputes, if one examines their causes and effects, are merely superficial problems. The main cause of political conflict is still the poverty of the people and nations. Under conditions of hunger and poverty, political stability is difficult to achieve. The general population of Asia is mostly unconcerned with political ideologies and doctrines. Their primary concern is the realistic issue of "clothing, food, and shelter." The interest of the common people in political doctrines is largely based on the issues of "clothing, food, and shelter." Therefore, if there is no solution to economic problems, political difficulties will inevitably increase. Although industrial production in various parts of Asia and the Far East is currently far behind that of other regions, modern methods of production have already given the people of Asia a new enlightenment. The industrial revolution is already underway in various parts of Asia. While governments can do their best to promote this industrial revolution, this commission, if it can provide timely assistance, can further accelerate this industrial recovery.</p>
<p>In the past Chinese society, those in leadership positions were all so-called intellectuals. For two thousand years, this scholar class largely detached themselves from realistic production and trade issues, and devoted all their energy to the study of literature. As a result, while the Chinese scholar class established great literature, art, and philosophy, they made no practical contributions to agriculture, industry, mining, economics, finance, and other issues. In recent decades, the Chinese intellectual class has gradually abandoned the purely scholarly life and sought to solve current realistic problems. This phenomenon can be called a major revolution in history. At the same time, in terms of social relations, the Chinese people have also acquired a new concept in recent years. In terms of economic systems, China has now adopted a mixed economic system, allowing state-owned enterprises and commercial enterprises to coexist harmoniously. This mixed economic system is necessary under the current circumstances. Certain industries, such as railways, electricity, and arms manufacturing, require government investment to compensate for the inadequacy of private capital. Another major reason for China's adoption of a mixed state-owned and commercial economic system is to prevent the vast amount of natural resources from being controlled by a few people.</p>
<p>Although this commission does not participate in actual reconstruction work, our work and recommendations will affect more than half of the world's population. This conference is truly a historic undertaking.</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in Various Parts of Guangdong, One Million People Homeless; Continuous Rain in Guangxi Creates Disaster</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] Due to continuous rain, various parts of Guangdong have suffered from flooding, with torrents erupting. Most of the flood prevention dikes along the East, West, and North Rivers have collapsed, and the rest are in imminent danger. Villagers are sounding gongs day and night to rescue them. Although the weather cleared up starting from the 15th, only the water level of the East River has receded slightly. The West and North Rivers are still rising without receding. It is estimated that the number of homeless disaster victims is close to one million, and the losses of farmers' livestock are impossible to estimate. Director Zhang Fakui of the Executive Headquarters and Chairman Luo Zhuoying of the Provincial Government are very concerned about the disaster and have convened relevant agencies for discussions in recent days. It has been decided that the Disaster Relief Sub-Bureau will allocate more than 300 tons of rice for emergency relief. Director Zhang is paying particular attention to local security after the disaster. As for the Yingde and Shaoguan bridges on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which were washed away, the Railway Bureau has been dispatching a large number of employees to actively repair them every day. Director Du Zhenyuan personally went to the construction site to supervise the repairs, ordering that all of them be repaired and reopened to traffic by the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch, 16th] Continuous heavy rain in the entire province of Guangxi has turned the counties along the rivers into vast expanses of water. A disaster has already formed, and the number of disaster victims cannot be counted. All the bridges on the highways have been washed away by floods, and transportation is blocked, making it impossible to transport relief supplies. The situation in the affected counties is extremely serious. In addition, typhoid fever is prevalent in Guilin, with a considerable number of patients.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US Approves Treaties with Four European Nations</h3>
<p>President Truman yesterday signed the ratification of the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria and issued a statement. Regarding the treaty with Italy, he stated: "Certain clauses of the treaty are not entirely in accordance with our wishes, and may be amended through the United Nations if necessary in the future. The ratification of the treaty with Italy has brought an end to an unpleasant chapter in Italian-American relations. At the same time, Italy has entered a new era, allowing its people to look forward with hope and confidence... The United States is pleased to stand by Italy as its people rebuild their democracy and restore their freedom in adversity, and the American people are determined to continue to assist the Italian people." However, President Truman's wording was different regarding Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria: "I believe it is necessary to publicly express regret over the fact that the governments of these three countries have disregarded the will of the majority of the people and engaged in suppressing public opinion. Since these three countries were liberated and the Yalta Agreement was established by the three powers, I have hoped that governments truly representing the people could be established in these three countries; but to this day, such governments do not yet exist..." Due to the signing of this ratification, the state of war between the United States and Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria has ended, and the United States' war against these four countries has come to an end.</p>
<p>Now, the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria have been established, but unfortunately, the establishment of the treaties does not necessarily lead to peace. Europe has just stopped the flames of World War II, but the smell of gunpowder is still shrouding the entire continent. We do not need to mention post-war Germany, but what we should point out is that if the situation currently in post-war Germany is allowed to drag on, the results will undoubtedly negate the gains of this war. Delay is unfavorable. The reason for the delay indicates a lack of policy on one side and a plan on the other; delay is their plan. At the time when the US President signed the ratification of the four-nation treaties, we also saw a speech by British Prime Minister Attlee, indicating that any future war is not only a matter of life and death for individuals, but also a matter of life and death for the entire culture. Although this speech was made in support of the United Nations, its significance is profound; and what is even more worthy of our careful consideration is that while President Truman was signing the ratification of the four-nation treaties, the British Prime Minister delivered this warning speech. Perhaps this can be said to be a kind of irony on the treaties themselves. The treaties have just been signed, but future wars have become the subject of politicians' speeches; if this is not an irony, what is?</p>
<p>In reality, the situation in Europe is too turbulent, and the struggle is too sharp. The coup in Hungary resulted in the creation of a pro-Soviet regime. In Romania and Bulgaria, the situation cannot continue like this for long. Under the coercion of powerful neighbors, Romania and Bulgaria will inevitably produce pro-Soviet governments and become truly vassal states. Romania had once brewed a coup, and the reason why further developments did not occur was probably because of the events in Hungary. Looking at the recent talk of a so-called Balkan Federation, the entire Balkans will be in danger of being swept away. Indeed, in the current situation, the so-called Balkan Federation has somewhat of a psychological warfare effect, with the aim of offsetting the Truman Doctrine and its assistance to Greece. However, what we want to raise the world's awareness of here is that the proposal of this kind of call is less of a psychological warfare attack and more of a probe of strength. The key lies in what policies President Truman will adopt towards Europe in the future, and whether he is prepared to engage in a contest of strength. The situation in Hungary also has the same meaning of a probe. Now a pro-Soviet regime has been established in Hungary, and the Anglo-American note on the situation in Hungary has also been rejected by the Soviet Union. The steps taken by the United Kingdom and the United States regarding the situation in Hungary in the future are really important. If there is no demonstration of strength, the future of the entire Balkans, and even the entire Europe, is truly worrying.</p>
<p>This is why we see President Truman frequently sending overtures to post-war Italy. In his statement on Italy after signing the four-nation treaties, his attitude was tactful and his affection was strong, which was distinctly different from his statement on Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. In the days when almost all of Eastern Europe has been swept away by the Soviet Union, Italy has become the vanguard of Western Europe. The US defense line is no longer in the Atlantic, no longer in the Rhine, but has extended to the Adriatic Sea, extending eastward to the east of the Aegean Sea. In order to protect this defense line, the United States must win over Italy and can no longer allow Italy to become a second Poland. Therefore, when signing the ratification of the treaty with Italy, President Truman indicated that the treaty could be amended as needed through the United Nations. However, what immediately follows the establishment of the treaty with Italy is the issue of realistic politics. Within ninety days after the treaty with Italy takes effect, all British troops stationed in Italy will withdraw, and the United Kingdom and Italy have already reached an agreement on this matter, exchanging notes yesterday. What we are worried about is that Italy's own military equipment is extremely pitiful, and the situation will be even more difficult to control after the US troops withdraw. Tito is eyeing it covetously from behind, and the Soviet Union maintains a strong military force in Europe. How will Italy handle itself?</p>
<p>In short, due to the signing of this ratification of the four-nation treaties, the state of war between the United States and Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria has ended, but there is still a considerable distance to go before peace is achieved. We do not yet see a prospect for peace; this can at best be called a truce. After this devastating war, how to rebuild world peace is a matter of hoping for the good efforts of politicians from all countries.</p>

<h3>The Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe Will Face an Important Test; The Hungarian Coup Created a Difficult Situation; There Seems to Be a Contradiction Between the Plan and the Truman Doctrine</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The Soviet Union's formal rejection this weekend of the US protest over Soviet policy in Hungary, as well as the UK's request for information on the matter, has again created tensions between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The political role of Secretary of State Marshall's "Continental Plan" for Aid to Europe will soon be put to the test. The main point of conflict between the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine is that the former advocates including the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in its Continental Plan, while the Truman Doctrine advocates never supporting communist governments with US dollars. This conflict has not yet been formally presented to the public. However, the development of the situation in Hungary, as well as the Soviet Union's clear intention not to give up its influence in Eastern Europe, has made it impossible to ignore the former conflict any longer. If the Soviet Union maintains a firm attitude towards the situation in Hungary, US economic aid will either be provided regardless of the political tendencies of the victims, or it will not be provided to countries within the Soviet sphere of influence. Therefore, the unresolved question is whether Marshall's economic aid proposal has political conditions attached. General Sviridov, the Soviet chairman of the Allied Control Commission in Hungary, replied to the US protest, and the Moscow-released communiqué of the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Ambassador Peterson, showed that the Soviet Union still felt resentful about the suspicion of the British and Americans that the Hungarian coup was a manufactured incident. Both documents also showed that the Soviet Union would continue not to allow other occupying powers to learn of the evidence that led to the resignation of former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy and others. It is said that Foreign Minister Molotov may have informed British Ambassador Peterson that there would be some amendments to the Soviet Union's position, but as of yet, the Foreign Office has not received a report that Molotov had first requested another meeting with the British ambassador last Friday. Moreover, the recent Soviet statement was issued more than 24 hours after the former rumor occurred, which proves that even if the former statement is true, it will not fundamentally change the Soviet Union's position. It is expected that the main issue that Foreign Secretary Bevin will discuss with French Foreign Minister Bidault in Paris next Tuesday will be the issue of whether the US aid proposal may have political conditions attached.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] It was learned today that Secretary of State Marshall and his senior advisors have now formulated a plan to deal with the chaos in Europe and the growing threat of communism, either to unify most of the continent by the end of the year, or to make it more divided than before, regardless of the Soviet Union's reaction. According to diplomatic officials, if the Soviet Union resolutely refuses to cooperate, it will undoubtedly force Western Europe to form an economic federation on its own, meaning that the Soviet Union and its Eastern European bloc will be deprived of practical US aid. It is said that Marshall hopes this will not happen, and that the Soviet Union will eventually cooperate, or at least allow some of the countries it rules to cooperate with the US proposal to form some kind of European economic federation. Marshall's policy is clearly a "open door" policy that welcomes Soviet cooperation. If the door is closed, it must be by the Soviet side. However, it is considered that the possibility of the Soviet Union closing this door is very high, which can be seen from the speech of Deputy Secretary of State Acheson yesterday.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary to Fly to France Today to Discuss European Economic Recovery; British Government to Consult with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 16th broadcast: Bevin is scheduled to fly to Paris tomorrow to discuss the entire plan for the revitalization of Europe proposed by Marshall with Bidault. At the same time, Bevin also stated that he will negotiate with the Soviet Union on the same issue, but Hua has expressed no interest. The communist newspaper "Pravda" criticized Marshall's proposal, saying that it was only a means for the United States to expand the Truman Doctrine.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] A Foreign Office spokesman announced today: Regarding US Secretary of State Marshall's plan for aid to Europe, the United Kingdom will directly consult with the Soviet Union. Initial contact will follow normal diplomatic channels. Foreign Secretary Bevin is currently in Paris to discuss the US plan to revitalize Europe tomorrow, but there is no news of whether he will personally go to Moscow. In addition, France has consulted the Soviet Union on its views on the US aid plan for Europe.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] Well-informed sources here have recently said that the British House of Commons is scheduled to debate foreign policy on the 19th, at which time the attitude that the United Kingdom should take towards Secretary of State Marshall's European cooperation plan will be the theme of the debate. Former Foreign Secretary Eden will also attend and speak on behalf of the opposition. Political figures here are now paying close attention to the speech to be delivered by Foreign Secretary Bevin, as Foreign Secretary Bevin will have already held talks with French Prime Minister Ramadier and Foreign Minister Bidault at that time, so it must be of great significance. In addition, it is expected that Colonial Secretary Jones will also make an important speech, explaining the United Kingdom's development policy for its African territories, especially the Gold Coast and Nigeria. In addition, the German issue will also be brought up for debate, to confirm the tendency of British officials to avoid a stalemate with the Soviet Union on this issue.</p>
<h3>President Truman Scheduled to Broadcast Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, This Port] The Voice of America will broadcast President Truman's speech to the graduating class of Princeton University on June 18 (Wednesday, Shanghai Summer Time, 6:30 pm to 7:00 pm). At that time, the President will accept an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University. The President's speech will replace the regular English program of the "American Round Table," and can be received by the following radio stations: Frequency 15250, 15150, 11790, 11730, 9650, 9490.</p>
<h3>US Foreign Aid Benefits 59 Countries</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 15th] According to Henna, in an article in the "Washington Star," since Victory over Japan Day, US foreign economic and technical assistance has benefited 59 countries. His investigation shows that the money spent by the United States in assisting the reconstruction of the shattered post-war world is more than 20 billion US dollars. Henna listed loans from the Export-Import Bank to China totaling nearly 83 million US dollars, and lend-lease materials worth approximately 700 million US dollars after Victory over Japan Day. Other surplus materials and UNRRA relief goods amounted to millions of awards. Henna also listed the special assistance of 695 million US dollars approved by Congress for the Republic of the Philippines, including 400 million US dollars paid for private war loss claims.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet War Can Be Avoided: Jackson's Observation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanover, New Hampshire, 16th] US Supreme Court Justice, former Nuremberg Tribunal Prosecutor Jackson, speaking to Dartmouth University students last night, said that the Soviet Union wants to do everything possible to avoid war with the United States, and that it is completely wrong to say that war is inevitable. The friction between the two countries today is mostly due to the fact that both sides want to expand their sphere of influence.</p>
<h3>Soviet Radio Broadcasts Pravda Commentary Criticizing US Policy Towards Europe; Says the Marshall Plan is Actually the Truman Doctrine</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 16th] Regarding the US aid plan for Europe, Moscow Radio broadcast a commentary from Pravda stating: "Marshall's plan, although seemingly novel, is actually just a repetition of Truman's policy of using US dollars to aid other countries and regain political power to interfere in their internal affairs. The United States will inevitably have such cries after eliminating its internal conspiracy in any country such as Hungary. The Marshall Plan, in its wording, deliberately makes it different from the Truman Doctrine, just to cover people's ears and eyes." The Moscow broadcast: "Marshall said at a press conference on June 12 that his plan for European economic recovery refers to all European countries, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and other European countries, but this is obviously contradictory to the US policy towards Eastern Europe. The purpose is nothing more than to deceive the American people by saying that the US plan was originally intended to be treated equally, but the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries themselves are unwilling to accept the conditions of US "aid." The true essence of the Marshall Plan is to openly endorse the European Federation launched by Churchill. Everything proves the significance of the US "aid" policy and has not changed."</p>
<h3>If the Soviet Union Wants to Seize Middle East Oil Fields, the US Will Resort to War: Wallace Said at a Press Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 15th] Wallace said at a press conference on the 15th that if the Soviet Union's expansion reaches the point where it can seize the oil fields of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States "should" resort to war. Later, Wallace added that his remarks might be misunderstood as being "hawkish," so he changed the phrase "should" resort to war to "will" resort to war. Wallace pointed to Turkey as the "king" in the great powers' "chess game," and the Soviet Union should know that up to Turkey, the Soviet Union cannot move forward without causing war. The US Navy will fight to defend the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. He believes that if the Soviet Union's current western border is further expanded, it would be "unwise" for the Soviet Union. When asked if the Soviet Union had "seized" Hungary, Wallace scoffed at it and said that if it is said that the Soviet Union intends to "seize" Hungary, then it can also be said that the United States intends to "seize" Greece by means of Truman's aid plan to Greece.</p>
<h3>Philippines Strives to Expand its Military</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Manila, 16th] The Republic of the Philippines has reached its first week of establishment and is working hard to expand its small, US-trained military into a strong force.</p>
<h3>Europe to Hold Round Table Conference to Discuss US Aid to Europe Plan; Soviet Reaction of Great Importance</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 15th] Diplomatic circles here predict that European countries may hold a round table conference within the next month to discuss economic cooperation methods based on the Marshall Plan for US aid to Europe. Countries vying to take advantage of the US suggestion for Europe may hold a round table conference in July. The reasons are based on the following two rapid developments: (1) Foreign Minister Bevin has declared that he will fly to Paris on the 17th to hold preliminary discussions with Prime Minister Ramadier and Foreign Minister Bidault, and may stay for two days. (2) France has invited the Soviet Union to exchange views on the American plan. The Soviet Union's reaction to this plan is of great importance. London diplomatic circles believe that although the US and the Soviet Union have disputes over the development of the Balkans, the Soviet Union may accept the Marshall Plan. Stalin has repeatedly told people that he would welcome US economic assistance. It is claimed that if the Soviet Union accepts Marshall's suggestion, the application of the Truman Doctrine in Europe will automatically be cancelled.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Replies with a Counter-Argument; The US Government Finds it Difficult to Accept; Hungarians Feel Surprised and Uneasy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] A State Department spokesman recently stated that as of 11 p.m. last night, Mr. Weems, the US representative to the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, had not yet received a reply from General Sviridov, the Soviet chairman of the commission, rejecting the investigation of the Hungarian political situation. Washington has naturally not received it either, so it is difficult to comment. Semi-official sources say that if the content of the note is the same as reported in the newspapers, then the United States will find it difficult to accept. The Soviet Union is encouraging the new communist faction politician in Hungary, Fiffa, to seize power and instead accuses the United States of sheltering members of the collapsed government, which is playing with fire. The United States has always supported fair elections in Hungary, hence this action. If the United Nations investigation committee is established in the future, the Soviet Union will be forced to present evidence of those accused of participating in the conspiracy. In short, this matter is subtle, and the final course of action can only be decided by President Truman or Secretary of State Acheson.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 15th] After the publication of the American note accusing the Soviet Union of interfering in Hungarian internal affairs, and the article by General Sviridov, the Soviet chairman of the Allied Control Commission, the Hungarian reaction can be divided into two categories: surprise and unease. Those who were surprised were surprised by General Sviridov's statement that the Hungarian National Assembly had unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the new government, because in fact no such vote had yet taken place. Judging from the opposition leader's remarks last week, it is unlikely that there will be unanimous support when the vote is taken. What makes Hungarians uneasy is the American note's statement that "if a satisfactory response is not received, we will take other actions." At the same time, Hungarian Justice Minister Ries has ordered the prosecutor's office to file a complaint with the People's Court against former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy and National Assembly Speaker Dejlga, which is contrary to Hungarian legal principles, because Hungarian law stipulates that the actions of the Prime Minister while in office can only be tried by the State Committee.</p>
<h3>Austrian President States Determination to Uphold Democracy</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Vienna, 16th] Austrian President Renner said that Austrian democracy cannot be overthrown by political advancements supported by foreign countries. However, President Wu admitted that the Austrian Communist Party has ambitious plans, but they can only obtain the power they deserve through elections.</p>
<h3>Content of Soviet Reply: Rejects British and American Suggestions</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 15th] Regarding the American note of the 11th of this month to General Sviridov, the Soviet representative and chairman of the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, requesting the organization of a British, American, and Soviet tripartite committee to investigate the Hungarian political situation, it has been learned that Sviridov replied to General James, the American representative, today, categorically rejecting the American request. The reply stated: "I do not believe that there has been any violation of the Yalta Agreement in the recent events in Hungary. Your country's protest is completely unfounded, so I must reject it. Your country's claim that the Soviet Union is interfering in Hungarian internal affairs is also a fabrication. Therefore, I find it difficult to accept the suggestion of a joint British, American, and Soviet investigation of the Hungarian political situation, and I do not think it is necessary. I believe that this action will interfere in Hungarian internal affairs and is unacceptable. The recent coup in Hungary was caused by the former prime minister's refusal to heed the opinions of the cabinet. The current situation has been resolved by the Hungarian parliament in accordance with constitutional procedures, and the parliament has expressed its trust in the new government and has granted it full power. These facts are undoubtedly well known to your country. The note recently submitted by your country, under the guise of assisting Hungarian democracy, is in fact an attempt to assist certain individuals who have been involved in conspiracies, which cannot be denied. Regarding the records of the interrogation of Kovacs, the secretary-general of the Hungarian Smallholders' Party, I do not believe that I have an obligation to forward these documents to the British and American representatives in Hungary. These documents have been sent to the Hungarian government because they are only related to the Hungarian government."</p>
<h3>British and American Authorities in Germany Permit the Opening of German Import and Export Businesses; Permanent Economic Committee to Be Established in Soviet-Occupied Zone</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, 15th] The British and American military governments in Germany have permitted the opening of German import and export commerce so that the economically merged British and American occupation zones can become self-sufficient. The US military authorities announced that three important agreements were reached last week, and another negotiation is scheduled to begin this week, so that Germany can export US$2 billion worth of goods in 1950. This goal cannot be achieved before 1950, because it is necessary to import raw materials from many countries first. Import business has already started smoothly. The agreements reached last week include: (1) A Swiss delegation signed an export agreement with representatives of the British and American zones in Berlin on the 11th, stipulating that Swiss importers can directly negotiate with German exporters in the British and American occupation zones. (2) British and American authorities have approved a US$13.17 million Bavarian export plan, including pencils worth US$6 million, toys worth US$5 million, and X-ray and dental equipment worth US$2 million. (3) The British and American authorities have reached an agreement in principle to organize an institution to handle imports, provide funds, and purchase American cotton and textiles. An Italian commercial delegation will go to Berlin this week to begin negotiations with the British and American authorities.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 15th] The German News Agency published today an order signed by Marshal Sokolovsky, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet occupation forces, announcing that the Soviet military government has transferred its economic administrative power to the German Central Affairs Bureau in the Soviet occupation zone. Previously, the bureau only provided advice in an advisory capacity. Marshal Sokolovsky's order personally designated the organization of a permanent economic committee composed of the heads of the industrial bureau, transportation bureau, fuel bureau, electricity bureau, agriculture bureau, commerce bureau, and food bureau of the German Central Administrative Agency, the leaders of trade unions in the Soviet occupation zone, and the head of the "Peasant Relief Organization." According to observers, this Soviet action is similar to the recent establishment of an economic committee and executive committee by the British and American occupation authorities.</p>
<h3>200,000 Seamen on the US East Coast Go on Slowdown; Transportation at Major Ports Comes to a Halt</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 16th] Two hundred thousand maritime workers on the US East Coast implemented a slowdown on ships on the 16th, so transportation at major seaports in the United States has come to a halt. The current maritime contract expired at midnight on the 15th, and the National Maritime Union is leading the "No Contract, No Work" movement with the support of four other "trade" unions. Shore workers are no longer boarding ships, and ship workers have stopped working. The union's tactic is to force the employers to expel the seafarers from the ships, causing the employers to close down due to the dismissal of workers. The union is trying to avoid using the word "strike." According to the union leader's estimate, this move will affect about 1,000 ships in various places. New York will be the first to bear the brunt. According to customs officials, there are currently 220 American ships in New York, of which 102 are under repair. Joseph Curran, president of the National Maritime Union, sent telegrams to various branches at 1:20 a.m. on the 16th, instructing "Do not sign contracts, do not sail ships," but all seafarers should stay on the ships as much as possible. This telegram applies to all chartered foreign coastal and intercontinental ships. The union negotiating committee has been ordered to refuse to extend the current contract if the employers insist on refusing to consider any improvements in wages, working hours, and working conditions. The West Coast Maritime Union is now negotiating separately with West Coast employers, but it is stated that if the East Coast Union cannot win, they will also go on strike.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Possess the Largest Fishing Fleet in History</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to personnel from the Allied Headquarters, once the Allied Headquarters' fishing facility reconstruction plan is realized this autumn, "the fishing fleet will have 821 large wooden fishing boats, 59 large trawlers, and 933 small trawlers. This number is even larger than its pre-war fishing fleet."</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Deeply Dissatisfied with US Policy of Appeasement Toward Korean Communists; Conflicting Opinions Within the Korean Independence Party</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 16th broadcast: Korean leader Syngman Rhee told reporters today: "Korea has only one way out. Korea must establish a 100% democratic government, otherwise it can establish a purely communist regime. Any 'mixed' government with some communists participating will never succeed. All that the Joint Committee can do is a compromise. Even the current compromise, 90% follows the opinions of the United States, and the Soviet Union's opinions only account for 10%, but South Korea will eventually be controlled by the communists. Koreans are not divided. The one who created the division is the policy of the United States. The United States implements a policy of purging communists at home, but in Korea, it adopts a policy of appeasement towards the communists, which is unwise."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 16th] Recently, the activities of various political groups in South Korea have become increasingly tense and complex. Representatives from the left-right cooperation committee and more than a dozen other groups, including Kim Gyu-sik, Lyuh Woon-hyung, Ahn Jae-hong, and Hong Myong-hui, discussed participating in the US-Soviet Joint Committee yesterday and today. Representatives from the various parties under the banner of the Democratic Front also discussed the content of the consultation form. Within the Korean Independence Party, opinions have been divided into two factions. The reformists advocate participation, while the attitude of the chairman and vice-chairman has not yet been stated.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 16th] Since the US-Soviet Joint Committee began issuing consultation forms to various political parties and social groups on the 12th, a total of 190 political parties and social groups have received the consultation forms so far.</p>
<h3>Indian Punjab Province to Conduct Regular Trial of Partition; Congress Party Denies Princely States' Right to Independence</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lahore, 15th] Although a preliminary agreement on the partition of the province of Punjab has been reached, dozens of arson incidents occurred here on Sunday. It is reported that the preliminary agreement on the partition established in Punjab stipulates that the Allies, Hindus, and Sikhs will divide the province into two parts, east and west, and the trial date has been set for the day after the Punjab Provincial Assembly meets, which is June 24.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 15th] The All India Congress Committee today unanimously passed a resolution of the Congress Working Committee, denying any Indian princely state the right to declare independence on its own and secede from other parts of India. It also expressed the hope that the rulers of the Indian princely states would recognize the current situation of the country and join the Indian Federation for the benefit of the people in their states and throughout India. During the debate, Nehru also stated that any foreign country that recognizes the independence of an Indian princely state will be regarded as an unfriendly act.</p>
<h3>British Officers Train French Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press, Algiers, 15th] A British military team consisting of 14 officers and 88 junior officers and soldiers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Barrow, arrived here by British warship today at the invitation of the French government to teach the French army how to use British military equipment and train the French air transport unit.</p>
<h3>Indonesian-Dutch Dispute to Be Submitted to Third-Party Arbitration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 15th] Indonesian Republican Minister of Economy, Gani, stated that Indonesia will ask a third country to arbitrate the negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. This action is taken in accordance with the provisions before and after the Linggadjati Agreement. We are still prepared to work for the benefit of this agreement and strive for a peaceful resolution. Gani did not state which country the third country is. Some people believe that Britain may be asked again to help resolve Indonesia's difficulties. Gani also stated that both the Netherlands and Indonesia knew when signing the Linggadjati Agreement that it was a basic agreement, and that the Dutch proposals and the Indonesian counter-proposals were simply their respective interpretations of the agreement. Although the Dutch side has not yet responded to the Indonesian counter-proposals, unofficial sources indicate that the Indonesian counter-memorandum is unfeasible.</p>
<h3>Allied Policy Toward Japan to Be Officially Determined Soon; US Plans to Retain the Right to Appoint Allied Supreme Commander</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 15th] According to authoritative sources, the Far Eastern Commission will pass the "Basic Policy" on post-war policy toward Japan at its meeting on the 19th. The Basic Policy is the result of long-term discussions by the eleven member countries of the committee. In fact, it is only a revision of President Truman's "US Policy Toward Japan." Its purpose is to permanently disarm Japan, promote freedom and democracy, punish war criminals, restore peaceful economic activities, handle reparations, and administer the military government through the Japanese government. In addition to reiterating the above-mentioned purposes, the Far Eastern Commission's decision will also reaffirm a section of the American post-war policy toward Japan, namely that the Allied Supreme Commander stationed in Japan should be another unit appointed by the United States. Some American officials believe that this section should be retained, because MacArthur's position may be replaced by a senior civil affairs commissioner from the United States. If the above-mentioned matter occurs, the United States can arbitrarily appoint it without seeking the full consent of other countries. With the exception of Australia, all countries supported this basic decision at last week's Far Eastern Commission meeting. Australia requested a week to consider certain technical issues. However, the drafting of the Basic Policy was initiated by Australia, and Australia is not expected to hinder the passage of the decision. Some committee members admitted that the policy seems to be outdated, but they believe that it is necessary to formally determine the occupation plan, and most of the occupation plans have already been implemented.</p>
<h3>Iran Orders Dissolution of Military Control Organization</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tehran, 15th, United Press] The Iranian Prime Minister today ordered the dissolution of the Tehran Military Control Organization, effective on the 17th. He stated that this organization was formed when the Allied forces entered Iran in 1941 and is no longer needed because law and order have been restored.</p>
<h3>Welles Broadcast: US Should Strive to Promote the United States of Europe; USSR Has Ambition to Dominate the World</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 15th] Former US Undersecretary of State Welles broadcasted on the 15th that he believes that the United States should do its best to encourage Europe to establish the United States of Europe. The United States should not hesitate to assist Europe in establishing the United States of Europe. He fully agrees with the Truman Doctrine, but believes that "our failure lies in the implementation of this policy, which requires rapid and effective strengthening of the United States' promises, and the issue of time is the most important. Europe is now encountering the most serious crisis since the war. The Soviet leaders have now decided to adopt an aggressive expansion policy to achieve the goal of controlling Europe and the Mediterranean, and ultimately controlling Asia as well. This situation has become increasingly clear since the end of the European war. Similarly, if the Soviet Union's above-mentioned plot succeeds, its power will quickly spread to all parts of the world, including the Western Hemisphere."</p>
<h3>US Establishes Committee to Study Aviation Safety Measures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] President Truman today appointed five experts to organize an aviation safety investigation committee. Landis, director of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, was appointed as the chairman of the committee, and the first meeting is scheduled to be held on Tuesday. In a letter to the committee, the president expressed his deep concern about air transport safety, especially after repeated plane accidents recently, and asked the committee to study the recent accidents and decide what measures should be taken to promote aviation safety. The president also asked the committee to recommend how the aviation equipment currently being manufactured should be improved.</p>
<h3>United Nations Committee in Holy Land Begins Investigation Work Yesterday; Arabs Stage General Strike and Market Strike for One Day to Show Boycott</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th] The United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee will begin its 90-day investigation work today. The first meeting, which will discuss procedures and other technical regulations, will not be open to the public. The committee will then go to various Arab and Jewish towns to conduct on-site investigations. The Palestinian Arab High Executive Committee initially stated that in order to oppose the United Nations investigation team, it has ordered all Arab organizations across the country to stage a general strike for one day from 4 am to 7 pm today. All Arab commercial and industrial activities, as well as schools, shops, and firms, will be suspended. Arab employees will be exempted from participating in the strike. The secret radio station of the Jewish underground organization Irgun broadcast tonight, welcoming the arrival of the United Nations investigation team to Palestine and guaranteeing that the safety of the members of the investigation team will not be harmed.</p>

<h3>Day of Reckoning for Two War Criminals; Sins of Blood Are Repaid; One Tiger, One Wolf, Executed This Afternoon; Parade Through the Streets Before Execution</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Japanese war criminals "Tiger of Jiangyin" Shimoada Jiro (see small picture) and "Wolf of Changshu" Yonemura Haruki (see large picture) were sentenced to death by the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. The sentence was reported to the Chief of Staff and approved by Chairman Chiang. It is scheduled to be executed at the Jiangwan execution ground at 2 pm today.</p>
<p>The military tribunal considered that the two criminals killed countless people during the invasion of China. Their execution will be a cause for great rejoicing. Therefore, before the execution, they will be paraded through the streets to show the public. The route has been determined as follows: Start from the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, pass through Broadway, Garden Bridge, the Bund, turn into Nanjing Road, pass through the Racecourse, West Nanjing Road to Jing'an Temple, turn through Huashan Road, Central Zhongzheng Road, the Great World, East Zhongzheng Road, Sichuan Road, North Sichuan Road, and go directly to the Jiangwan execution ground. At that time, four motorcycle patrol cars will lead the way, followed by a police car from the Garrison Department, a prison car, a police car with a machine gun, an execution car, and then a red anti-riot police car will bring up the rear. The military tribunal posted announcements on the streets of the city yesterday afternoon to inform the public. When the execution is carried out today, prosecutors Tu Guangjun and Fu Shude will supervise the execution. Li Yechu, the chief clerk of the court, Wang Shuliang, Yuan Qing, and others will go to the execution ground to take care of the arrangements.</p>
<p>Shimoada Jiro is 30 years old and from Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. He was formerly a sergeant in the Jiangyin Japanese Military Police. During the Anti-Japanese War, he captured and killed many comrades of the Anti-Japanese War who were active in the suburbs of Jiangyin. What was especially cruel was that on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival after Japan surrendered to China, he tied up twelve of our compatriots who were being held prisoner in the backyard of the unit, and Shimoada and other Japanese soldiers stabbed them to death with bayonets. Yonemura Haruki is 53 years old and from Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. He was formerly the captain of the Changshu Japanese Military Police. The criminal, in order to seek merit and promotion, carried out unjust prisons on a large scale. Between 1942 and 1943, he arrested more than 50 residents in Changshu, Taicang, and other places under the pretext of searching for Communist bandits. Except for a few who were released, the rest were either tortured to death, buried alive outside the North Gate of Changshu, or sent to the Japanese military court for execution. He was inhumane, and the defendant was therefore promoted from lieutenant to major and awarded medals.</p>

<h3>Representative Of Industry And Commerce Expresses Grievances; Luo Qinghua Went To Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the announcement of the workers' cost of living index in May, industries and businesses in the city have found it difficult to bear the burden. Three trade associations, the Machine Industry, Electrical Equipment Industry, and Metal Smelting Industry Associations, have written to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting that a city-wide discussion be convened with industrial associations to discuss remedies. After the Chamber of Commerce convened a joint discussion with forty industrial trade associations, the following conclusions were reached: (1) Request the government to restore the year-end salary of 1936; (2) Matters concerning labor-capital assessments and wages should comply with factory regulations; (3) Employers should pay wages based on the previous month's index to allow for cost calculation. Concerning the recent amendments to the Factory Law by the Legislative Yuan, which removed the original draft provisions stating "workers in public transportation cannot strike" and "no wages will be paid during a strike," it was felt that these exceeded the times and were unsuited to the national situation, greatly affecting social production. Therefore, it was necessary to sincerely express these opinions to the central government. Permanent Director Luo Qinghua was specifically delegated to go to Nanjing last night to petition the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and relevant ministries, requesting remedies. Mr. Luo had received a telegram from Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs yesterday morning, possibly in connection with this issue. Mr. Luo will also present the pain that Shanghai industry and commerce feels regarding the profit tax levied by the tax collection office to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the simplified collection method proposed by the Municipal Council be adopted.</p>

During his tenure, he committed many evils and was reported. He was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters on April 2nd and transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation yesterday. It is reported that Cai Sen is accused of six major crimes: (1) Looting Huge Sums Of Money Under The Guise Of Searches And Sharing The Spoils: Cai personally led the so-called "Secretary Wang," "Deputy Officer Xu," and over 20 soldiers to surround residences along Hainan Road in the city.

(2) Harboring The Enemy And Appointing Them As Councilors And Informants: A Japanese businessman feared being sent to a concentration camp, so he was appointed as an informant by the battalion headquarters under a Chinese name in exchange for 100 million yuan.

<h3>Postal, Telecommunications, and Train Fare Increases: To Be Implemented In The Near Future</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Post Office, the Telecommunications Bureau, and the Railway Bureau are suffering heavy losses every month and have been relying on state subsidies to maintain operations. The price increases for postage, telegram fees, and railway passenger and freight fares have been brewing for a long time. Recently, it has been rumored that the Ministry of Transportation has approved them. The reporter visited the three bureaus yesterday, and they all stated that they had not received orders from the ministry. However, the principle of price increases has long been agreed upon by the authorities, and the three bureaus have never ceased their efforts to make the price increases a reality. Recently, the gap between commodity prices and the fees charged by state-owned enterprises has become increasingly large, and state subsidies are increasing, which is not a long-term solution. Therefore, price increases are inevitable. Currently, the authorities are only considering the extent of the increase. One source says that July 1 will be the date for the implementation of new prices for railway fares, postage, and telegram fees. Another source says that it will be postponed until the 15th of next month.</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Railway Bureau originally planned to adjust ticket prices starting yesterday, but later received instructions from the Ministry of Transportation to temporarily postpone it until July 1.</p>

However, it is generally estimated that central subsidies for public utilities in the city may be stopped starting next month, as subsidies are not a thorough solution. If central subsidies are stopped, public utilities will inevitably increase prices again, but the magnitude cannot be estimated.

<h3>Dong Jiuzhi Indicted For Embezzling Shao's Property As A Traitor: Discrepancy In The Number Of Silver Boxes; Unauthorized Opening Without Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Shao Shijun, the director of the puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau, fled after the victory, leaving behind a huge amount of property, which has led to repeated disputes. Previously, Shen Shubao was accused of concealing Shao's property as a traitor. Now, Dong Jiuzhi, the former Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, has been accused by the Military Statistics Bureau of embezzlement during the takeover. After investigation by the District Procuratorate, he was indicted yesterday for embezzlement. The main points of the indictment are as follows: Defendant Dong Jiuzhi, 40 years old, from Jiaxing, resides in the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League on Jin Shenfu Road. After the enemy surrendered in October 1945, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters borrowed Shao Shijun's residence at No. 80 Aitang Road as an office space. Shao and Jiang Dongrong had already transferred valuable gold jewelry, diamond rings, jewels, and opium to the home of doctor Shen Shubin. What remained in Shao's residence was only furniture, telephones, electric fans, table lamps, safes, and a few paintings and antiques. On August 20, the headquarters appointed former Propaganda Chief Zhuang Hecheng and staff member Zhuang Jie to take over. The next day, Dong Jiuzhi, the Chief of the General Affairs Section, moved in to arrange things. Later, Jiang Dongrong was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau on suspicion of concealing enemy and puppet property. Zhuang Hecheng, Zhuang Jie, Dong Jiuzhi, and others were suspected of embezzling the property of the traitor, and the Military Statistics Bureau transferred the case to the High Procuratorate, ordering the investigation of the embezzlement of the property of the traitor and the opium smoking of Jiang Dongrong. According to the defendant Dong Jiuzhi, although he did not admit to embezzling the property of the traitor, it was found that the inventory list of furniture left in Shao's residence included three small silver boxes and one large silver box, a total of four boxes. Later, the Military Statistics Bureau, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Songhu Garrison Command, sent personnel to Shao's residence for inspection and found that there were actually five safes. Furthermore, the defendant opened the safes without authorization without reporting it. This is an indisputable fact for the defendant. The claim that one in the barbershop had already been opened, and two that had been opened under the stairs and in the passageway were empty, but after inspection by the Military Statistics Bureau, one in the barbershop had a small drawer that had been pried open with the butt of a 77mm gun. The traces were also identified on the spot as matching the 77mm gun butt used by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters Armed Guard. Although the number of valuables reported lost by Jiang Dongrong cannot be proven, it was found that there were still more than 500 Japanese, Manchurian, and puppet banknotes, 30 puppet tax bureau account books, and 8 tax guarantee certificates in the two unopened safes opened by the Military Statistics Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters. It cannot be claimed that there were no items left in the opened box. The defendant's behavior is beyond question, and it is difficult to say that there is no suspicion of embezzlement. The defendant's actions violate Article 1, Paragraph 1, and Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Anti-Corruption Regulations, and he should be prosecuted according to the law."</p>
<p>The other defendants in the same case, Zhuang Hecheng and Zhuang Jie, were not indicted due to insufficient evidence.</p>

<h3>Aftermath Of The Fuxing Island Case: Jin Zhensheng And His Father Accuse Liu Gu of Extortion; Defendant Ticketed For Shoplifting; Subpoena Not Delivered</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the aftermath of the Fuxing Island gold hiding case, Jin Zhensheng, one of the defendants, was previously declared innocent by the District Court. Now, Jin Zhensheng and his father, Jin Caizhi, in the role of private prosecutors, are accusing Liu Gu of extortion. According to their complaint, Liu and Jin are relatives. On March 3, Liu went to Jin's house and threatened them, saying, "You people got a lot of gold bars from the Fuxing Island case, and there are a lot of rumors going around. You need to take out 1-2 million yuan to entertain people to ensure that nothing happens." Jin refused his request. The next day, Liu, along with "Old Man" Wu Dekui and 5-6 unknown people, sealed off the front and back doors of Jin's house and searched for a 10 tael and 3 mace and 7 fen bar of gold that had been purchased by the Jin family, which was hidden in an iron box under the floor. They also took Jin Caizhi and Jin Zhensheng to the Beizhan Police Precinct and then transferred them to the District Procuratorate. After Jin was declared innocent by the District Court, he felt resentful that Liu was guilty of extortion, so he filed a complaint with the District Court. The case was being heard in the District Court yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, the defendant Liu Gu had been caught picking a passenger's pocket containing 160,000 yuan on a Route 16 trolley bus and was transferred to the police station. Therefore, the subpoena was not delivered. His wife submitted a statement of defense requesting the District Court to transfer the prisoner from the District Procuratorate for questioning. The plaintiff stated yesterday that he was willing to withdraw the lawsuit because he was surrounded by people. Judge Zhu Yuhuang informed him that the private prosecutor in this case had no right to withdraw the case, and the hearing was postponed until the defendant could be brought to court for questioning.</p>

<h3>Hundreds of Trucks Converted into Buses; Seven More Routes to Be Opened This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to a responsible person from the Public Utilities Bureau who spoke to reporters yesterday, the Bureau recently obtained one hundred trucks from the Executive Yuan's Bureau of Supplies.

<h3>Reader Consultation: Education and Culture</h3>
<p>Terms in Painting</p>
<p>Mr. Li Chongxin asks: I usually like to practice painting, but I have no one to guide me. I don't know what "Six Perfections" and "Six Principles" are. Please give me detailed guidance.</p>
<p>[This column's answer] Among the terms in Chinese painting theory that begin with a number, there are approximately: (1) Six Principles (see general dictionaries for details, not listed here). (2) Six Essentials (Qi Yun [spirit resonance] combined with force, standards and regulations both old-fashioned, changes and alterations are rational, coloring and painting have luster, coming and going are natural, learning from teachers means abandoning shortcomings). (3) Six Strengths (Seek brushwork with "silkworm's head and wild goose's tail," seek talent with stubbornness, seek strength with meticulousness, seek reason with eccentricity, seek dyeing without ink, seek length with flat painting). (4) Five Defects (rigidity, engraving, knotting). (5) Twelve Taboos (Overly dense composition, indistinguishable distance, mountains without Qi Mai [energy veins], water without sources, scenery without danger, roads without exits and entrances, rocks with only one side, trees with fewer than four branches, figures hunchbacked, buildings cluttered, inappropriate blending, and unregulated dyeing). (6) Three Grades (divine, marvelous, capable). (7) Four Grades (divine, marvelous, capable, unrestrained). (8) Two Schools (Southern, Northern). (9) Seven Preconditions (refined paper, the brush is in harmony with the hand, the color and ink are pure, newly traveled mountains and rivers or newly seen famous works, the person asking for the painting is a good connoisseur, the inspiration is at the moment when skill is neither raw nor overripe). (10) Four Paths (Purify the mind to eliminate worldly worries, be good at reading books to understand the realm of reason, reject early praise to go far, and be close to Feng Zhong to correct the style). (11) Two Defects (Formless, Formed). (12) Four Energies (Muscle, Flesh, Bone, Qi). (13) Six Qi (vulgar, craftsman, fire, grass, boudoir, clumsy and black, etc.). As for the so-called "Six Perfections," I have never heard of them.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Hankou, 16th] The case of Hu Xiaoyang, the chief of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters who was responsible for commanding the "June 1st" incident at Wuhan University, committing suicide by drowning has now been fully confirmed.

<h3>Coal Market Experiences Low-End Buying</h3>

All other types of grey cloth, twill, and grey serge rose in price.</p>
<h3>British Merchants Temporarily Suspend Resumption of Rubber Market in China</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] It was previously rumored that Dunlop Company sent a representative to Tianjin, planning to restore the rubber market in China; and that the company will sell 50,000 to 60,000 pairs of bicycle tires, which was kept in inventory in India, with a gift of copper rims, at a cheaper price than domestic products. When this reporter inquired about this matter to the Industry and Commerce Counseling Office, it was said that this rumor is already past. Currently, the difficulty of the rubber industry is the input of natural rubber. The current national demand is 3,500 tons. Rubber is controlled by Britain, the United States, France and the Netherlands. The control was cancelled this year, but after the implementation of the import limitation measure, those who have raw materials have unique commodities to keep, and within a month the price per pound increased from 1,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, and it is not easy to purchase. Now because a part of the natural rubber can be settled, the price has fallen back to 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, but the number of imported rubber is still insufficient for application, and actually a part of it relies on smugglers. The rubber industry is a promising industry in our country, and the import of its raw materials should be relaxed.</p>

Fortunately, New Light and Yong Yarn opened high, stabilizing the market. After the opening of Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn, prices were sold from 83, 160, 82, and 112 to 6,800 yuan. Numbers 224, 223, 14, 185, 97, and 36 also closed positions, but the market price struggled around 6,800 yuan as 85 and 218 continued to buy. Numbers 157, 65, 24, 104, 61, 14, and 97 repeatedly supplied, while China Flour, although its price was suspended due to the upper limit, was pulled down by Number 162 and others, with Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn falling to 6,600 yuan.

Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn then rose to 7,060 yuan. Although Numbers 76 and 31 closed positions, Numbers 224, 32, 36, 35, and 157 pushed it even further to over 7,200 yuan. Current Delivery Yong Yarn was first brought to the upper limit by Number 89, and Numbers 186, 117, 85, and 143 sold to 7,200 yuan. Buying interest from Numbers 32, 35, 99, and 89 remained strong, and China Flour Lang Delivery and New Asia also approached the upper limit. At this time, Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn also reached the upper limit for a time, and Numbers 22, 76, 102, 148, 36, 54, 190, 94, 218, and 104 all sold off. Rumors that the Deferred Delivery Securities Margin would be changed to 30% cash and 20% substitutes caused the price to fall back to the 7,000 yuan level. Although Numbers 8, 196, 69, and 196 bought to over 7,200 yuan, Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn finally broke through the 7,000 yuan mark at 12:00 due to Number 224's strong selling. Numbers 85, 117, 54, 65, 152, 148, 112, and 213 bought, and Number 152, Number 89, raised Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn to the upper limit again, rising back to over 7,200 yuan. At 12:20, China France fell to the lower limit in chaos, with Numbers 223 and 97 selling, and Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn closed at 7,130 yuan. After closing, Number 169 and others brought it to 7,200 yuan, but then Number 199 sold to around 7,120 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn and China Flour rose to the upper limit and then declined, each rising slightly less than 10%. New Light and Xin He each rose slightly less than 5%. Yong Gong and Mei Ya rose slightly, Qin Xing and Xinhua were flat, China France and Jing Fu fell, Land Flour rose to the upper limit, China Silk was flat, and New Asia rose to the upper limit and then declined, still rising slightly more than 5%. Li An Business and Lun each fell by 5%, Wu He fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly. For Deferred Delivery, Yong Yarn rose to the upper limit and then declined, rising slightly more than 5% along with China Flour, Xin He rose slightly less than 5%, and Yong Gong and Jing Fu fell slightly, while Mei Ya, New Light, and Qin Xing rose slightly. For old stocks traded outside the exchange, China rose 10%, World fell slightly, and China Business and Five Continents each rose 5%, while the rest remained flat.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhixin and Others Go to Beijing to Discuss Securities Margin Issues</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The substitute portion of the securities margin for deferred transactions at the Securities Exchange, since it was changed to temporarily allow cash or bonds to be used as collateral before the ministry order arrives, is now in a state of uncertainty. With the deadline for deferred delivery approaching at the end of June, Securities Exchange General Manager Wang Zhixin, Assistant Managers Yang Yinpu and Gu Shanchang, and Financial and Economic Ministry resident Securities Exchange Supervisors Wang Aotang and Wu Zongtao, along with Finance Ministry Currency Division Director Dai Mingli, traveled to Beijing together in the night train some days ago to thoroughly discuss and properly resolve the issues. It is heard that Mr. Wang and others will conduct in-depth research with the authorities of the Financial and Economic Ministry to quickly determine perfect policies for the Securities Exchange.</p>
<h3>News on Cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui</h3>

<h3>China Trust Bureau Allocates Artificial Silk, Silk Factories Absorb and Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, acting as agent for the government Property Management Committee, allocated the thirty-first batch of artificial silk to the silk weaving industry today (16th), allocating a total of 178 boxes of artificial silk. It is heard that since the bureau began allocating artificial silk last year, it has allocated a total of 17,228 boxes of artificial silk up to this batch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the person in charge of the bureau's barter department stated: Last month, Japan shipped a total of 60 fu pounds (200 pounds per box) of rayon to China, totaling 3,000 boxes. General MacArthur's headquarters recently sent a telegram stating that it is expected to ship 400,000 pounds to China this month. Deputy Manager Tatsu of the bureau, who was in Japan to negotiate barter deals, returned to China by ship some days ago and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within this week.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the artificial silk market continued to be firm yesterday, as silk factories showed considerable demand. Those holding goods took the opportunity to raise prices. The 120-count Dongyang Youwo silk opened at 9.4 million yuan in the morning with transactions, and closed at 9.3 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, buying interest from various parties remained strong, so market prices rose again, with the final bid price being 9.1 million yuan, an increase of 800,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. New Tianqiao silk was 9.6 million yuan, and other miscellaneous brands were 9.5 million yuan, and they were bulk goods without wooden boxes. The trend is still expected to be good in the market today.</p>
<p>The raw silk market was slightly better yesterday, with bid prices for all grades up by about 500,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Only five dan of D-grade silk were traded yesterday, priced at 2.4 million yuan, but with a five to six-day term. C-grade silk was bid at 4.5 million yuan but was not traded. There were also several dan of Tiger Stove new silk traded, priced at several grades from 2.15 million to 2.25 million yuan. Demand for Qianjing was minimal, and there were no transactions yesterday.</p>
<p>The fabric market was boosted yesterday due to high raw material costs and positive sentiment, leading to price increases for both quilt covers and checked crepe. Huaqiang quilt covers were traded at 8.95 million yuan, and Dachang quilt covers were bid at 9.1 million yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Checked Ying crepe opened for spot delivery at 4,200 yuan. Checked Ying crepe opened for spot delivery at 4,200 yuan, and 4,400 yuan for delayed delivery, rose by 100 yuan midway, and the price subsequently dropped due to large-scale sales, and the final transaction price was 4,000 yuan, and 4,200 yuan for delayed delivery. Hua Jin crepe rose sharply due to the increase in the price of rayon, and high-end goods were bid at 18,000 yuan, and ordinary goods were traded at 17,500 yuan. Transactions in other goods were minimal, and market prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Rise Slightly, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>National bonds rose slightly yesterday, with credit easing. Room 552 and others bought, while Rooms 604 and 360 sold. National Bond C opened at 7,300 yuan and rose from 7,100 yuan to 8,000 yuan, then hovered around 7,600 yuan, with about 6 to 7 million traded. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B rose by 200 yuan, C rose by 100 yuan, and D and E each rose by 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Among foreign stocks yesterday, British Alliance continued to rise the most strongly, while Yisha was merely in a stalemate. The Hong Kong Shanghai telegram shrank to 14.3 yuan. A certain Tong from the securities group aggressively bought British Alliance, and Hesheng's buying interest was also strong. Guang merchants and retail investors supplied. Yisha opened at 69,000 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 72,000 yuan, and then fell back to 69,000 yuan near noon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British Alliance rose slightly less than 10%, Yisha Kenzhi fell slightly, and Jardine Matheson, Paper, Shipping, and Steel each rose by 5%, while the rest rose only slightly.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton market was firm due to the shift from tight to loose credit. Closing prices for all grades of cotton yarn in the morning were up 200,000 to 400,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, indicating positive market sentiment. Transactions among industry players were quite active, and yarn factories also showed strong buying interest. The market situation was stronger than on Saturday, and prices showed a firm trend. In the afternoon, Indian cotton, White Locke, was traded at 1.58 million, and Jia Lira rose from 1.28 million to 1.35 million.

Tongzhou coarse cotton was 1.2 million, Fire Machine was 1.05 million, and Nantong Cang and Beitaicang were 1.15 million for delivery to the factory. The number of transactions for each grade was in the hundreds of pieces or more.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Monthly Resumes Publication</h3>
<p>The Money Industry Monthly was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China and was published by the Shanghai Money Industry Trade Association. Its content was insightful and was well received by academic circles. After the Shanghai Battle in 1937, Shanghai fell and the newspaper ceased publication. It is now heard that the newspaper has been resolved to resume publication on July 15 by the association, and Shen Rixin and Zou Rangxiang have been appointed as publishers, and Wei You # and others as editors, actively preparing. The address of the newspaper is temporarily attached to the Shanghai Ningbo Road Money Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Fir wood’s price decreasing trend is nearing the end, having already declined by one-third compared to the peak in volume. Since foreign pine did not experience a sharp increase, it has also not greatly declined, hovering around 7,000 yuan. Hinoki has new shipments arriving in Shanghai, and the price is expected to decrease.</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchants Held Meeting Yesterday, Demanding Open Northbound Transport, Price of Yarn in the North is High, Demanding to Cancel Restrictions Based on the Hankou Example</h3>
<p>More than 100 companies in the city that transport yarn and cloth north have seen their business come to a standstill since the implementation of control on northbound transport of yarn and cloth in February of this year. An emergency meeting was held yesterday afternoon at the Yarn and Cloth Association, chaired by Gao Wendao. A resolution was passed unanimously opposing the control measures and demanding the cancellation of restrictions and the restoration of independent sales. The authorities will be requested to quickly cancel the northbound transport control measures in accordance with the Hankou example, and handle it in accordance with the simplified rules for yarn and cloth transfer permits in order to maintain commercial hardship. According to the industry, a total of 255 Shanghai-based and Northeast China northbound yarn and cloth merchants have registered with the Spinning and Weaving Control Commission, but only over 3,000 pieces of yarn are allowed to be exported each month, and only over 1,000 yarn numbers are allowed, constantly leaving Shanghai yarn and cloth merchants without the possibility of business, and will cause panic in Northern China. The current high price of yarn in Northeast and North China is enough to stimulate yarn prices to rise. The authorities use the production volume of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China as a standard, but it is not known that a large amount of Japanese yarn was sold in North China at that time, so Hong Ying can rest assured that there will be no lack. Now that Japanese yarn is cut off, if Shanghai yarn is not transported to the north, the clothing problem of the people of North China will become increasingly serious, so the industry firmly demands that the authorities open northbound transport in order to maintain business.</p>
<h3>Importers and Exporters Again Request the Revocation of the Time Limit for Exchange Settlement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association previously stated that the Central Bank set a uniform deadline of May 24 for all export sales entrusted for sale to be settled for exchange. Otherwise, the designated bank's foreign branch would execute the sale at an unlimited price. When the news came, foreign markets took the opportunity to suppress prices, and domestic exporters were panicked. After the association pleaded the merits and demerits, it telegraphed the relevant ministries and courts of the Central Government and the Central Bank to revoke the deadline in order to alleviate commercial difficulties. It is now heard that the Central Bank has extended the aforementioned deadline for selling and settling foreign exchange by another thirty days to June 24, after which no more alternative measures will be considered. The Import and Export Association believes that export goods are often difficult to sell in a short period of time due to seasonality or demand. Setting a deadline for exchange settlement is tantamount to ordering a wide-price sale. The impact is not only that exporters will suffer significant losses, but also that the export of domestic native products will become more stagnant. It is harmful to the country and the people, so they specially requested the Central Bank again yesterday to revoke the deadline.</p>

<p>Quick News from Yanzhou</p>
<h3>Director Peng Recounts Past Events, County Magistrate Li Shares Personal Experiences</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Ling Songshou</p>
<p>From the place where the railway was being repaired, I walked fifteen li to Yanzhou. My feet stepped step by step on the sleepers in the green grass and the rusty steel rails, and I felt a sense of bewilderment.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Yanzhou, after a short rest, taking advantage of the remaining evening glow, I went with the officers and men of the Fang and Liang battalions to visit the desolate station. All the construction here was originally destroyed before the war. We have to thank the enemy for their hard work in achieving today's form. I saw that the platform still had several bridge frames, which the enemy planned to use to repair the Sishui bridge, but they didn't have time, and they laid down their weapons.</p>
<p>Many locomotives were parked at the station, numbering more than thirty, and currently, there are more than fourteen that can be used. After future repairs, more than twenty locomotives will not be a problem. This should be a great boost for the railway transportation authorities, given the current shortage of materials.</p>
<p>When the Communist army attacked the city, they once reached the station but soon withdrew. To this day, the buildings on both sides of the station are riddled with bullet holes, resembling a desolate scene. However, the nearby residents are accustomed to the situation and remain unmoved. Old women grind wheat bran with their bound feet, occasionally casting surprised glances at our group of travelers from afar. In the sky, flocks of crows return to their nests, frequently cawing in the evening breeze. Yanzhou, having experienced many dangers, has now returned to its tranquility.</p>
<p>A Fourth-Class Small County</p>
<p>Yanzhou has been renamed Ziyang County. The county is very small, classified as fourth-class, less than one-third the size of Teng County. Its importance is entirely due to its military significance. On the one hand, it is the connecting point between the Jinpu and Yanjin railways, with transportation reaching in all directions. Moreover, the western part is entirely a low-lying area, known as a den of thieves throughout history. The base of the heroes of Liangshan Marsh was originally located near present-day Dancheng. Cai Jing, stationed in Yanzhou, ultimately prevented these petty criminals from causing trouble. Even now, three to four thousand remnants of Liu Bocheng's Communist army stubbornly occupy this area, with as many as nine puppet county governments in Dancheng. They still dream of reliving the heroic dreams of the Liangshan Marsh. If there is talk of suppression in the future, Yanzhou will naturally still be a good base.</p>
<p>Peng's Demeanor</p>
<p>After arriving in Yanzhou, I visited Peng Guodong, director of the Provincial Government's Southwest Shandong Office. Peng is from Chaling, Hunan, and has held many important military and political positions in the past. Recently, he was transferred from the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters to take charge here. He has not yet met Wang Yaowu, chairman of Shandong Province. Because Wang was previously in the Ninth War Zone when Peng was the deputy director of the Political Department, he knew a little about his aspirations and knowledge. Therefore, soon after assuming the chairmanship, he repeatedly sent letters and telegrams urging him to take charge of western and southern Shandong's administration and provincial party affairs. In today's declining officialdom, to still have people like Wang and Peng and such a style gives the reporter a very deep and good impression. I talked with Director Peng for half a day, and we both lamented the heavy burden on the common people during the military period as a hidden worry. The location of the office was the Shaoling Academy in the Song Dynasty and the Longxing Temple in the Ming Dynasty. To this day, the pagoda of Longxing Temple still towers on the northeast corner of the city. In the courtyard, there is an earthen mound, the highest point in the city, with a Ministry of Works ancestral hall, dedicated to the statue of the Minister of Works. The Minister of Works' father once served as the magistrate here, and the Minister of Works came to visit his parents, so he left such a memorial.</p>
<p>Remnants of the King of Lu</p>
<p>The reporter and Director Zhao climbed up to overlook the city; Peng pointed to the place where the Ming King of Lu resided, now a ruin. It is said that the grease discarded from the royal palace made the nearby area particularly fertile, with wells in every mu of land for irrigation. There were three harvests a year, and each harvest could provide food for the entire city for three months. As the morning breeze blew, the wheat waves rose and fell, and the farmers bent over, reaping in between. The reporter heard Peng's trivial talk about Yu Sang, and his thoughts surged endlessly. On the south side of the earthen mound, there is a huge mansion facing the street, stretching across several platforms. It is the relic of the story of "审头剌汤" (The Trial of the Head and the Assassination of Tang) in Peking Opera. Meng County's Liangxia Store is related to the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai's love affair as classmates. The peaks and mountains are beautiful, and there is a ancestral hall for the two of them. The reporter passed through the area, and the travelers were in a hurry, regretting that they could not visit the place. But here, I saw the old site of this ancient love killing case, which can be considered a compensation for the past. The Tang family's old business was mounting and backing paintings. The people here call them "Tang the Mounter's family," which is quite contemptuous. Unfortunately, the reporter doesn't know the details, otherwise, it would be worthwhile to visit.</p>
<p>Atmosphere of Wind and Sand</p>
<p>The streets of Yanzhou are very long, two or three Huaxing from the station to the east gate, and more than five Huaxing from the east gate to the west gate. These two sections were commercial districts before the war, but now they are desolate. Those who come and go in the misty yellow sand, besides military vehicles, are only the clumsy ox carts, slowly dragging forward. The drivers constantly whip the backs of the oxen and make "Ah... Shh..." sounds. Most of the large shops on the roadside are closed. Taking photo studios as an example, although there are four or five, none of them dared to accept my rolls of film for development, because they were not confident that they could develop them. Soybean milk and fried dough sticks are the main food here, still with a bit of southern flavor, and the price has reached 500 yuan per stick. A few shops sell white rice, with the words "Jiangnan Rice" and "Wuxi Qing Rice" added. This, in the eyes of southerners, is a very strong northern atmosphere. I am a southerner, and my taste is different, so I only eat rice that costs 3,600 yuan per catty. 3,600 yuan per catty, which is equivalent to 540,000 per dan (unit of weight).</p>
<p>The So-Called Three "Mores"</p>
<p>I took a bath in a very luxurious bathroom. I chatted with the attendant, and he told me that Yanzhou has three "mores": more wells, more temples, and more hidden prostitutes than overt ones. The abundance of wells is caused by geographical factors. Central Shandong is mostly mountainous, while the western part is a vast plain. The Grand Canal and Dushan Lake run through it, and the mountains and waters in the west all flow northwest into the Grand Canal or the lake. This affects the capacity of the Grand Canal itself and is the main reason why the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu often breaches its banks. However, it has made it convenient for the people in this area to dig a few feet and get water. As for the abundance of temples, this is not surprising in a theocratic society, but in my opinion, the temples here are not that many. As for the third sentence, it refers to private prostitutes. It is said that there are very few public prostitutes here. In a land of propriety and righteousness and a place close to the sacred ground, it is allowed to have its traditional masks.</p>
<p>Entering and Exiting the City Gates</p>
<p>The strict checks by the military authorities have divided Yanzhou city into two areas, inside and outside the city. Most of those entering and exiting the city gates are soldiers, with very few civilians. County Magistrate Li Zhengzhong told me that a certain official sent by the province to take over the job here could not enter the city, even with the provincial government's commission. In the end, he had to ask an acquaintance to inform the county government, and the county government sent someone to "guide" him before it was resolved. Because of this, goods cannot flow smoothly inside and outside the city, and prices inside the city are already twice as high as outside the city. This is probably due to the military's meticulousness under the past harsh environment, which has become a habit. Otherwise, now that Yanzhou is heavily guarded and the front line has been pushed 200 li away, why is it still so vigilant? Thinking of Suqian County in northern Jiangsu, where the Communist army is active only a dozen or even a few li away from the city, if I were transferred here, I don't know what I would do. I talked with County Magistrate Li about this matter and felt that for the sake of Yanzhou's social future, I urgently hope that the authorities can pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Administrative Miracle</p>
<p>I also talked with County Magistrate Li and Secretary Sun Youmou of the county government about the difficulties of county administration. The previous magistrate, Mr. Ma, was transferred to Tai'an. They two took office, and it hasn't been a few days since they took over the seal. During Magistrate Ma's tenure, due to the hard defense of the isolated city, he was busy dealing with military affairs. Therefore, the things that should have been done were not done, and the organization of the county government was fundamentally incompatible with the current laws. Currently, the county government is busy reorganizing and conducting a household survey.</p>
<p>Talking about the treatment of public servants and teachers, he first told me the highest figure: the section chief gets 220,000 yuan per month. Some junior staff members get 78,000 yuan. Based on the county government's two meals of noodles, it still costs 110,000 yuan per month. That is to say, to work in the county government, one has to bring 32,000 yuan from home every month to have two meals of noodles a day. Those like the servants, who get 20,000 or 30,000 yuan a month, can at least afford to drink water. Secondly, dealing with military demands is also a difficult matter. Currently, there are more than 200 military units in Yanzhou city. He listed many difficult examples for me to hear. They two used to work in the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters and had indeed worked in the army for several years. They said that in the past, they always thought that the army's demands on the county government should be a piece of cake and not that difficult. Now that it's their turn, they realize that being a county magistrate is not easy. There is quite a sense of repentance in their words. Sharing personal experiences, military and political colleagues should express sympathy after reading this. Accepting the county magistrate's kindness, I was invited to eat a noodle meal in the afternoon—this was their second meal, and they specially added a fried egg to change my taste as a guest from afar. During the meal, things to be done were listed, such as: mass organization training, youth organization training, administrative cadre training classes, libraries, mass education centers, literacy classes, health propaganda...etc. I deliberately interrupted him disappointedly: "Everything requires money!" He said well: "Let's do the things that don't cost money first!"</p>
<p>The Second Army Group is the main force in the battle in central Shandong. I met with Commander-in-Chief Wang Jingjiu. He told me about the dynamics on the battlefield and firmly said: "After the recent completion of the new deployment of the National Army, there will be a major change in the war situation!" He is one of the "Three Kings of Xuzhou," tall and calm in his later years.</p>
<p>The headquarters is borrowed from a magnificent institution, which is often unique here. Red tiles and yellow walls, colorful and dazzling, give people a sense of solemnity and majesty!</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Tanggu New Port (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianjin, 8th (Air Mail) Xing Qishen</p>
<p>The construction of New Port was decided by the Japanese after they occupied North China in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic, in order to plunder the essential resources of North China, such as coal from Datong, iron from Longyan, salt from Changlu, and soil, and for the purpose of importing finished products into China. At that time, the location for port construction was studied several times. Technical personnel of the South Manchuria Railway advocated building it near the mouth of the Daqing River, that is, the location of the large northern port advocated by Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father. The Japanese military believed that Tanggu had convenient transportation, with the Tianjin commercial port behind it, and that industry and commerce would be easy to develop, and that the construction time would be economically convenient. Therefore, it was decided to build the port in Tanggu. In June of the 28th year, the Tanggu New Port Temporary Office was established in Beiping, under the Xingzhong Company, and began investigation and surveying. At that time, the plan was quite grand, with the goal of exporting 20 million tons of coal and 7 million tons of salt, iron, and stone annually, and with an annual throughput of 8 million tons as the first phase of the project. Construction began in October of the 29th year, and in October of the 30th year, it was transferred to the North China Transportation Company, renamed Tanggu New Port Port Bureau. At the peak of mobilization, there were about 1,000 staff members, about 2,500 technicians, and about 10,000 laborers. The required funds were about 800 to 900 million yuan of the puppet United Currency at that time. At the same time, construction of the direct railway between Datong and Tanggu began. By August of the 34th year, when the Anti-Japanese War was won, only 24 kilometers of the Datong-Tanggu railway had been completed, and the port construction project was completely suspended. The degree of completion of the constructed parts was not consistent. The important projects that have been constructed are described below:</p>
<p>Construction Progress</p>
<p>1.  Breakwaters: According to actual measurements, the south breakwater was 5 kilometers complete, and a partially completed part was more than 4 kilometers. The north breakwater had a partially completed part of about 6 kilometers, and only 540 meters of the accumulated breakwater part was completed.</p>
<p>2.  Channels: The entrance channel has been dredged to a depth of 5 meters, about 13 kilometers long and 130 meters wide, allowing passage from New Port to the first and second wharves of New Port.</p>
<p>3.  Wharves: The first wharf of New Port is 700 meters long, about 90% complete, and the second wharf is 350 meters long, partially completed.</p>
<p>4.  Locks: The lock construction project is 80% complete.</p>
<p>5.  Mechanical Factory: The mechanical factory has simple equipment and is roughly in embryonic form.</p>
<p>6.  Ships: There are more than 100 ships and marine machinery.</p>
<p>7.  Railways and Highways: The railway runs from Tanggu Station to the first and second wharves of New Port, 10 kilometers long. The highway has 6 kilometers of completed road surface, and the rest is uneven.</p>
<p>After the victory, in October of the 34th year, the Tanggu New Port Affairs Office was established by the Tianjin District Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications. In April of the 35th year, it was changed to the Tanggu New Port Engineering Office of the Ministry of Communications, and in August, it was changed to the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>After the Takeover</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrendered, the construction of Tanggu New Port was completely stopped, the order was extremely chaotic, ships were sunk, materials were lost, machines were destroyed, houses were damaged, roads were bumpy, vehicles were lacking, and food and accommodation were difficult. There was almost a desolate scene of a full moon. After the takeover in April of the 35th year, emergency measures were taken to prepare for the resumption of work, such as repairing office buildings and dormitories, repairing roads, adding transportation equipment and telecommunications equipment. May and June were the periods for consolidation work. Since July, the parts of the project completed by the Japanese have been continued to be completed first, in order to be applied immediately, and a temporary work plan has been prepared, which has been implemented month by month from July to December. As for the end of the year, the projects to be done have been completed. Since January of the 36th year, construction has been carried out gradually according to the three-year plan.</p>
<p>The work and progress resumed from April of the 35th year to March of the 36th year are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Building Locks</p>
<p>The lock project was suspended in August of the 34th year, and resumed in July of the 35th year. After a year, the machinery was damaged and destroyed, materials were lost, and the lock was also submerged in water. After four months of consolidation and construction, the project below the wooden surface was completed in mid-November. The water-retaining earth dams on both sides were dug open, and water was released into the lock. On December 15, all the above-ground projects and mechanical equipment were completed, and the channel in the port was dredged to 3 to 4 meters below low tide. The test run was successful, and various shipping companies requested to pass through. From December 17 of the 35th year to March 31 of the 36th year, a total of 64 ships passed through.</p>
<p>In the past, when 3,000-ton ships passed through the Dagu Estuary into the Hai River, they had to use lighters to unload part of the cargo outside the estuary before they could enter the port. When ships sailed from the Hai River to the Dagu Estuary, part of the cargo had to be loaded onto lighters after the ships reached the estuary. Now, after passing through the locks, they can enter and exit fully loaded, reducing the trouble of lighterage and greatly facilitating the shipping industry.</p>
<p>Rectifying Ships</p>
<p>(1) Recovering Ships: After the Japanese surrendered, the ships of New Port were misappropriated by various parties and scattered in various places. After the takeover, the first thing to do was to recover six tugs from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In September, two crane ships and one gasoline boat were recovered from the US military stationed in Tanggu. In October, a dredger was recovered from the Qingdao Port Authority, and two tugs and one soil transport ship were recovered from the 8th Regiment of the Shandong Security Corps. In December, another tug was recovered from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai. A total of 14 ships were recovered. The remaining ships misappropriated in various places are still being negotiated for recovery.</p>
<p>(2) Salvaging Ships: Before the takeover, many ships were sunk in various places. Due to the lack of workers and tools, they had to be salvaged gradually according to priority. Currently, 14 ships have been salvaged, and the rest are being salvaged.</p>
<p>(3) Repairing Ships: There were about 80 ships originally stored in the port and salvaged, most of which were damaged and unusable. Therefore, they rushed to repair them for emergency use. In order to speed up the process, part of the ships were sent to state-run or privately-run factories for repair. A total of 38 ships were repaired by themselves, and 18 ships were sent to outside factories for repair.</p>
<p>Rushing to Dredge</p>
<p>After the victory, work was stopped. Because the breakwater was not completed, mud and sand drifted into the port, causing it to become increasingly silted up. The measurement in September showed that the main channel was only 2 to 3 meters deep, and the area in front of the first wharf was silted up to 2 meters. Since October of the 35th year, four existing mud barges have been used, and a self-propelled dredger has been borrowed from the Haihe Engineering Bureau to rush to dredge. The channel has been dredged to a depth of 3.5 meters, and part of the area in front of the first wharf has been dredged to a depth of 4 to 5 meters, which can barely allow passage. At the same time, the dredged soil was transported to the low-lying area to be filled in the northeast corner of the first and second wharves, and a total of about 160,000 cubic meters of soil has been filled.</p>
<p>Other Projects</p>
<p>(1) Water Supply Equipment: The completion of the water supply project not only supplies water to factories and worker dormitories, but also supplies fresh water to ships parked in the port at any time for the operation of engines and drinking water for passengers.</p>
<p>(2) Repairing Roads: After the takeover, most of the roads in the port were damaged and uneven. After gradual repairs, they can barely be used. It is estimated that 12.5 kilometers of roads have been repaired, with an area of 100,000 square meters.</p>
<p>(3) Repairing and Building Houses: A total of more than 20,000 square meters of new and repaired houses have been built.</p>
<p>Wharf Business</p>
<p>The wharves are divided into Tanggu and New Port. The four wharves in Tanggu are located on the Binhai River, and the New Port wharves are located in the port. Because the silt in front of the New Port wharves has not been completely removed, there are still few ships berthed. In mid-January of this year, part of the area in front of the first wharf was dredged to a depth of 5 meters, and the 5,000-ton giant ship "New China" has berthed there to load and unload goods. However, most of the current business is still at the Tanggu wharves.</p>
<h3>Boating on West Lake</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 10th (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>
<p>Hangzhou is experiencing a heat wave like midsummer, followed by drizzling rain. The summer heat is driven away by the overcast rain, and it feels like early autumn. The West Lake also changes with the climate, sometimes delicate and fiery, sometimes gentle and calm. One afternoon after a rainstorm cleared, I invited Mr. Feng Zikai, Mr. and Mrs. Li Puyuan, and the new writer Mr. Wuming to the lakeside.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng loves West Lake the most, loving her tranquility and serenity. He once painted a landscape painting of West Lake in the remote southwest, longing for West Lake, and he once collected poems praising West Lake by ancient people to decorate the walls for appreciation. Now, Mr. Feng has three small houses in front of the Ge Ling Mountain in the Inner West Lake, which are arranged neatly and elegantly. The painting he made in the rear, longing for West Lake, is still hanging in the center of the guest room. He once told me that he has traveled through more than a dozen provinces, but he feels that West Lake is the best.</p>
<p>West Lake, she can make people think deeply and immerse themselves in the realm of thought. She can make people transcend the mundane and reach a sublime realm. Boating Trip</p>
<p>I went with Mr. Wuming in our unique "Shen Bao rowing boat" to the Inner West Lake, landed on the shore, and arrived in front of a very Chinese-style house. Mr. Feng had already come out to greet us. Mr. and Mrs. Li Puyuan were already waiting at Mr. Feng's house, and we invited them to come aboard.</p>
<p>We asked: "Where are we going?"</p>
<p>"Wherever the rower pleases!" said Mr. Feng. So we slowly passed Fanghe Pavilion, Feng Xiaoqing's tomb, and then glided past Su Die's tomb. I sighed that Su Xiaoxiao's tomb was so embellished, but Su Manshu's tomb was unattended. Mr. Wuming said: "This is better. Otherwise, Master Manshu will also be uneasy in the ground."</p>
<p>The rowing boat passed through the Xiling Bridge, and the mountains surrounding the lake were covered with a thin veil of white mist. I proposed again the slogan that Hangzhou should be built into a cultural city, and the three of Feng, Li, and Wuming naturally expressed their approval. Here, we hope that Hangzhou will not be built into a garden city that only has a superficial appearance for people to admire, let alone be built into an uninspired Hollywood-style oriental Hollywood. We want a cultural metropolis with a beautiful soul. Mr. Feng said: "How can literati live in the complicated Shanghai? Mostly because of兼职 (part-time jobs), such as teaching in schools or being editors in libraries, they would not be able to live easily if they quit." Therefore, we want to call on academic and cultural institutions to move to Hangzhou. At the same time, the state should reward cultural products and provide a concrete guarantee for the lives of literati. The above two points require the government to make a resolute decision to implement, but they also depend on the efforts of cultural figures.</p>
<p>Returning by Boat in Wind and Rain</p>
<p>The boat had passed Ruan Gongdun, and the east wind gradually blew from the center of the lake. Arriving at the small island of Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, we stepped on the Nine-Bend Bridge and thought of the blinding vermilion color of the lakeside buildings. The railings of this Nine-Bend Bridge and the Swastika Pavilion are also red! But they are a bit darker brown. Feng and Li said: "Colors like this still look a bit old, while the vermilion colors in places like Broken Bridge seem too beautiful." Mr. Feng remembered that there used to be a couplet by Yu Ququ in Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, but now it is gone. He also remembered Nanmu Hall, so we turned into the Temple of the Worthies, which looked dilapidated. Although a few side rooms and halls can vaguely show the former scenery, the flower path is barren, the branches are scattered, and the rooms are full of dirt and dust. We finally arrived at Nanmu Hall, and some of the ceilings seemed about to fall, but the four hugging Nanmu trees stubbornly tried to maintain their firmness to support this dilapidated courtyard. There is a pool in the courtyard, with the words "Idle Release Terrace" written on it. The glass windows on all sides are broken, and the window frames are covered with cobwebs. Mr. Feng stroked his long beard and said that a case had occurred here: "Before the war, a girl went to the toilet on the left side of Nanmu Hall, but she didn't know that a robber cut her to death and took the girl's gold bracelet. At that time, there was a telephone line to the city, and the lakeside was immediately placed under martial law, and the thief was caught." We wondered why Xiaoyingzhou is a must-see place for visitors, but Nanmu Hall, which is also on the small island, has been treated coldly. I think Nanmu Hall can be slightly decorated to serve as a place for literati gatherings, and the rooms in front of Nanmu Lu can be used as temporary reception and rest places for literati. It is a pity that it is left unused now, and it is not a way to preserve famous scenic spots to allow it to become barren.</p>
<p>We went around to the stone steps where the boats were moored on Xiaoyingzhou, and the black clouds converged from all directions. The rain gently knocked on our foreheads, and there were slight ripples on the lake. The heavy fog obscured the scenery in front of us, and our rowing boat sailed into the depths of the misty rain. The five people in the boat all said in unison: "It's really returning by boat in the wind and rain."</p>
<p>Mr. Three Nos</p>
<p>Mr. Feng was originally known as "Mr. Three Wan": the so-called Three Wan means that he used to teach in Jiangwan, Shanghai, lived in Chongde Zhanmen Wan, and lived in Yangliu Wan, Jiaxing. Now, some people call him "Mr. Three Nos": that is, he does not teach, does not give speeches, and does not attend any banquets. He now specializes in research and writing. Mr. Li is a great general of the drama movement, and he is now directing several plays in Hangzhou. We asked him to write a few more scripts on this beautiful West Lake. Mr. Wuming is immersed in writing on the West Lake, and he can be said to be a new writer who is devoted to writing (author of "Beast, Beast, Beast" and other novels). That night, I prepared wine for a late-night chat, and everyone felt the need to strengthen the warmth.</p>

<h3>The Activities of Tsarist Russia's Representatives in Outer Mongolia during the Early Republic</h3>
<p>— Zheng Linshou</p>
<p>Korostovetz, a confidential advisor during the Tsarist Russian era, dedicated his life to being a diplomat. After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, he served as a key Russian official during the Sino-Russian negotiations regarding Southern Manchuria (1901) and the Treaty of Portsmouth following the Russo-Japanese War (1905). From 1907 to 1912, he was specially appointed by the Russian court as the plenipotentiary minister to China, and from then on, he was regarded as an authority on Far Eastern issues. At that time, Tsarist Russia had designs on Outer Mongolia and sent Korostovetz as its representative to Kulun to conclude a treaty with the Outer Mongolian government. He resided in the capital of Mongolia for eight months before returning to the Russian capital. More than a decade later, Korostovetz, with the cooperation of Hauer, a lecturer at the University of Berlin (who had translated books such as "The Veritable Records of the Qing Dynasty"), compiled his knowledge and experiences regarding Mongolia from the height of Mongolian power until 1925 into a book entitled "From Genghis Khan to the Soviet Republic." It was published in 1926 by the Druckerei de Gruyter in Berlin, Germany. This grand book consists of 41 chapters, an appendix containing the constitution of the Outer Mongolian Republic, a total of 351 pages, 38 illustrations, and a detailed map of Outer Mongolia. It is truly a masterpiece of Mongolian history. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, our country has been weakening, and there has been a lament about the inability to reach the distant frontier. Foreign powers have taken the opportunity to invade and conspire to separate our dependencies. Now is the time for our people to strive and strengthen ourselves. How can we afford to engage in petty squabbles? Korostovetz's book discusses the relationship between Russia and Mongolia and the process of Russia's management of Outer Mongolia in great detail. Therefore, I have selected important aspects of the relationship between China, Russia, and Mongolia to inform those who are concerned about the issue of Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>During the reigns of Genghis Khan and Batu Khan, Russian territory was once conquered by the Mongols. Russian monarchs were required to pay homage to the Khans and offer tributes. Promotions and demotions were controlled by the Mongols. Later, due to frequent internal strife among the Mongols, their power gradually declined, and the outer tributaries gradually rebelled. By the middle of the 16th century, the Russians could no longer be restrained. At the beginning of the 18th century, Peter the Great attempted to open a route through the northern territories to India. From then on, Russian power began to extend into Central Asia. Since Outer Mongolia had long been a shield for China, it was inevitable that there would be dealings with our government. Therefore, the Treaty of Nerchinsk between China and Russia (1689), the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), and the Treaty of Aigun (1858) were all related to Mongolia.</p>
<p>The Russian and Mongolian borders were adjacent, and the mutual trade between the two sides was frequent. The Russians always regarded Mongolia as a source of raw materials and attached great importance to its significance as a buffer zone. Expert meetings and the dispatch of commercial inspection missions deep into Mongolia were not without reason. At the end of the 19th century, Russians flocked to Mongolia for inspections. In 1910, the Moscow Chamber of Commerce funded a commercial inspection delegation led by Colonel W. Popow. Representatives from major Russian merchants and the Ministry of Commerce participated. The delegation members gathered in Kyakhta and departed in several teams, traversing Mongolia and reaching as far south as Zhangjiakou. This made important contributions to the promotion of Russian commerce in Mongolia and the establishment of banks. Later, the government sent University Professor Bogolepow to study the economic situation in Mongolia, and he also published a specialized book.</p>
<p>As for the trade goods between Russia and Mongolia, industrial manufactured goods, cloth, ironware, enamel utensils, flour, sugar, tobacco, matches, wine, kerosene, and silver ingots were exported from Russia to Mongolia; wool, leather, various furs, and pig and sheep intestines were mainly transported from Mongolia to Russia. The commerce between China and Russia in Mongolia rose and fell. During the Russian civil strife from 1918 to 1922, its position in Central Asia was greatly affected, and Chinese commerce took the opportunity to develop.</p>
<p>During the Xinhai Revolution, Outer Mongolia declared its independence, with Dschebdsun Damba Hutuktu as the Great Khan. At that time, Outer Mongolia sought help from Russia, and Russia also benefited from supporting Outer Mongolia's independence. However, initially, it was still hesitant due to fear of conflict with China. When Outer Mongolia sent representatives to St. Petersburg in 1911, the Russian government considered whether to grant an audience, and the government's decision was only made after the encouragement of the Russian Minister to China.</p>
<p>The most active advocate for Russia to establish its influence in Mongolia was Korostovetz. In December 1911, Korostovetz had just returned from Beijing and repeatedly visited Foreign Minister S.D. Sasonow and Prime Minister W.N. Kotowzew to exchange views. The cabinet then decided to specially appoint Korostovetz as an envoy to Kulun. This was approved by the Russian Emperor, and 100,000 rubles were allocated for gifts and travel expenses. Although the Russians kept this move highly secret, the news media had already revealed the news of the Russo-Mongolian treaty. The Beijing government was greatly disturbed and sent Noyantu to Kulun to persuade the Hutuktu, but he was obstructed by the Mongols, and the Chinese troops sent could not enter the territory.</p>
<p>In early September 1912, Korostovetz left St. Petersburg, passed through Irkutsk and Kyakhta, and arrived in Kulun in a few days. At that time, the key figures in the Outer Mongolian government were Sain Noyan Khan as Prime Minister, Prinz Hangda Dorji as Foreign Minister, Da Lama as Interior Minister, Erdeni Wang Namsarai as Finance Minister, and Dalai Wang as Minister of Military Affairs. Most of them were pro-Russian elements. As for the Russian personnel participating in the negotiations, in addition to the envoy, there were also Secretary Eltekow and Ljuba, the Consul-General in Kulun.</p>
<p>Initially, the Outer Mongolian princes were unsure whether to be pro-China or pro-Russia. After Korostovetz repeatedly explained the benefits of being pro-Russia and the harms of being pro-China, on the one hand, he used gentle means to purchase printing presses and establish newspapers to promote Russian culture and set up Russian schools to win over Outer Mongolian youths. On the other hand, he used intimidating methods to request the government to send troops into the territory and forced the pro-China lamas to withdraw from the meetings. With the secret help of the Hutuktu's wife, the pro-Russian faction finally won. As a result, the Russo-Mongolian treaty and its annexes were signed on October 21, 1912. The next day, Foreign Minister Hangna Uorji personally went to the Russian consulate to congratulate Korostovetz on behalf of the Hutuktu, and narrated how joyful the pro-Russian faction was and how disappointed the pro-Chinese faction was. Korostovetz then donated 50,000 rubles in the name of charity to the Mongolians for longevity and distributed gold watches, cigarette cases, vases, and other items to the princes.</p>
<p>As for the content of the treaty, the Russian government in St. Petersburg had already drafted a draft, intending to have the Mongols accept it. Unexpectedly, the Mongolian side also proposed a draft of the treaty, the gist of which was: "Mongolia has broken away from Chinese oppression and declared itself an independent country, subject to the rule of the Great Khan. Russia should first recognize Mongolia's independence and be willing to protect it." As for Russia's desire to recognize Outer Mongolia's autonomy and the special right to elect the Hutuktu as monarch, it was not mentioned at all. The Russians not only had no right to purchase real estate but also could not travel within the territory without obtaining permits. Because of these various issues, the opinions of the two sides were divided, and a rupture was imminent. After repeated discussions and the elimination of dissidents, an agreement was finally reached.</p>
<p>The original treaty consisted of four articles and seventeen annexes. The four original articles are translated as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Imperial Russian Government will assist Mongolia in maintaining its autonomy and possessing its own army, and will not allow Chinese troops to enter the territory or Chinese to colonize it.</p>
<p>Article 2: The Mongolian monarch and the Mongolian government shall allow Russian citizens and Russian businesses to enjoy all the rights stipulated in the annexes. Citizens of other countries shall naturally not enjoy rights superior to those of Russian citizens.</p>
<p>Article 3: If the Mongolian government deems it necessary to conclude special agreements with China or other countries, such special agreements shall not harm or alter the provisions of this treaty and its annexes without the consent of the Imperial Government.</p>
<p>Article 4: This treaty of friendship shall take effect on the date of signing.</p>
<p>Today, after our country's victory in the war of resistance against aggression, the overall situation has not been completely improved, and the threat of foreign aggression still exists. What has been achieved by the efforts of our more than 400 million Chinese people over the past thirty years? What was the price of the eight years of sacrifice? Reflecting on the past and present, how can we not feel emotional?</p>

<h3>Protector</h3>
<p>— Zijin</p>
<p>Downstairs in the courtyard, there was a chirping sound of little chicks. I went downstairs to take a look, and sure enough, my wife had bought them from a countryman's carrying pole into the city. A total of sixteen chicks were bought, costing 40,000 yuan, each worth 2,500 yuan. I blamed her for buying too many and too expensive. She said, "These are hatched chicks, not like those raised in a heated kang, which only cost a thousand or a few hundred yuan each. Those raised in a heated kang are not easy to raise to adulthood. Hatched chicks are natural, lively, and interesting. It's worth buying them even if they are a bit more expensive."</p>
<p>I laughed and said, "You're really not afraid of trouble. Aren't you tired of raising chicks yet? Just thinking about it for you gives me a headache!"</p>
<p>She said, "Not at all! Look at their downy, yellow fur, their tiny island-like figures, they're so endearing! Besides, watching them grow up day by day, it's worth raising them for the sake of interest."</p>
<p>"Interest? Fun? I still remember you crying for the chicks and ducklings. Is crying also interesting and fun?" After I said that, she couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Two years ago, in the countryside of Tunxi, because there was open space in the school with a lot of water and grass, she bought dozens of chicks and ducklings and raised them, acting as their nanny every day, chasing them in and out, sifting crushed rice for the chicks,撈浮萍提蚯蚓 (I don't understand this part, perhaps gathering duckweed and earthworms) for the ducklings, borrowing chicken coops and duck pens to make comfortable nests for them. She was very busy and enthusiastic. The chicks and ducklings grew up day by day. After two months, the chicks were about to grow wings, and the ducklings could swim and forage for themselves.</p>
<p>Ten of each, they mingled together as friends. The chicks pecked at the grass, hopping around, while the ducks stretched their heads and beaks, swaying and waddling into the damp places. In the evening, my wife put them in separate nests, letting them each find their different sweet dreams.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, one night, we went to a banquet at a relative's house in Tunxi. Afraid of returning to school too late, we stayed overnight at their place. The next morning, upon returning, we met a student who gave us an unpleasant report, saying that all the chicks had been dragged away by weasels, and only the ducklings were safe and sound.</p>
<p>When we went to the small room where the chicks and ducklings were kept, we found that there were indeed no chicks left in the coop.</p>
<p>My wife's disappointment was, of course, needless to say. She was angry and regretful, with tears in her eyes, returning the chicken coops to their owners. She released the ducklings, which wandered around on the ground, sniffing and rolling, seemingly mourning for their companions.</p>
<p>My wife originally favored chicks. Although she also raised ducklings, she didn't like them very much because they were more troublesome to raise, and the ducklings also produced more excrement and urine, which was a bit too dirty. Therefore, she had no intention of raising them anymore and gave them all to the country people.</p>
<p>After the victory, we moved to a university in the mountains. Her preference and interest led her to raise chicks again. Raising chickens in the mountains was really great. They grew up very quickly. In a few months, she raised many hens, which laid eggs, collecting them in pairs. Therefore, we didn't have to worry about having eggs every morning.</p>
<p>Also, in the early summer weather, a wild cat came from somewhere. Taking advantage of people's lack of vigilance, it dragged away a chicken every day, first dragging away the smaller ones, and later even dragging away the larger ones. It was impossible to prevent. We often found dead chickens that had been harmed in the weeds, with a bite on the head and the blood sucked out. Sometimes the meat on the thighs was eaten clean, and the mutilated body was thrown down, becoming a tragic, pale corpse.</p>
<p>When she saw these tragic scenes, she was easily moved and burst into tears.</p>
<p>These past events made me worry about this kind-hearted protector. This time, I couldn't help but warn her again. She said, "Okay! There shouldn't be any more weasels and wild cats in this place! I hope that assassination and harm will disappear from now on."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she placed the sixteen newly bought chicks in a small wire basket, covered with a large towel, and hung it high on an iron hook under the eaves. Every night, she prayed for the safety of the chicks before quietly going to sleep.</p>
<p>May this kind-hearted protector not encounter any conspirators and assassins this time.</p>
<h3>Sounds of the Qin</h3>
<p>— Yang Daming</p>
<p>A string of sharp notes slid down, placing memories on the piano keys. The green notes hold your laughter; I dream of a soft, rosy little mouth that can weave stories, and kind, tearful eyes.</p>
<p>On the empty canvas of my heart, I once painted a faint blue hymn. I have forgotten the peach blossoms of March, the roses of May. I write down the warmth of your hairline and your gentle murmurs.</p>
<p>Life is only young, because you are with me, keeping me company by this ebony-colored piano. Your silver bell-like voice blooms purple flowers in the depths of my soul. I listen to the soliloquy of your soul.</p>
<p>By the piano under the moonlight, you tell me the story of Romeo and Juliet. Under the pale green light, I am lost in a dreamlike contemplation. I am silent because I have had too many sorrowful stories.</p>
<p>Therefore, you don't continue to tell this beautiful story. You begin to feel lonely, and your eyes are wet with tears of disappointment.</p>
<p>Therefore, you ask me to tell you the sorrows hidden in my heart so that you can bear a part of my spiritual loneliness. But I answer you with silence because I don't want to paint a dark shadow on your pure white heart. I gently stroke the piano keys, placing my lonely sorrows on "One day when we were young."</p>
<p>Seeing your crystal tears, it must be a beautiful world! Sometimes the rouge of women ignites the flame of my youth, and sometimes a faded story makes me cry all night. — Finally, my sorrowful tears extinguished the flame of my youth. For the sake of your youthful health, I should leave this ebony-colored piano. I cannot bear to erode your beauty. Let us write a page of pure and sincere friendship, leaving it in the distant days as a memento of friendship.</p>
<p>No stories, no poems...;</p>
<p>A string of sharp notes slid down, placing memories on the piano keys. The green notes hold your laughter. But my fingers have already turned to stone.</p>

<h3>The "Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River" and Empress Zhen: A Minor Problem in Literary History</h3>
<p>— Tang</p>
<p>Cao Zhi's famous work "Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River," according to legend, expresses his love for his sister-in-law, Empress Zhen, wife of Cao Pi. It is said to have been written "moved by Zhen." This legend has almost the same breadth as the ode itself. The earliest record of this legend is found in Li Shan's commentary on the "Wen Xuan" in the Tang Dynasty, which quotes "Ji Ri." The original text is:</p>
<p>"At the end of the Han Dynasty, the King of Dong'a of Wei (Cao Zhi) sought the daughter of Zhen Yi unsuccessfully. Emperor Wu (Cao Cao) returned and gave her to the General of the Five Senses (Cao Pi). Zhi was extremely displeased, thinking of her day and night, neglecting his duties and forgetting to eat. During the Huangchu period, he went to court. Emperor (Cao Pi) showed Zhi Zhen's gold-threaded belt pillow. When Zhi saw it, he couldn't help but burst into tears. At that time, she had already been slandered to death by Empress Guo. The Emperor vaguely realized the situation and kept the crown prince (Cao Zhi) for a banquet and then sold the pillow to Zhi. Zhi returned... Resting on the Luo River, he thought of Empress Zhen. Suddenly, he saw a woman coming, saying, 'I originally entrusted my heart to the king...' After saying that, she suddenly disappeared. Then, she left a playful pearl for the king, and the king responded with a jade pendant. He was overcome with grief and joy and then wrote the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River. Later, Emperor Ming (Zhen's son) saw it and changed it to the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River." If this public case really existed in the life history of Cao Zhi, this talented man, it would not be a bad story. But, if it is false, it would be unfairly slandering the ancients. However, we have proved that this story is indeed the result of embellishment by meddlesome people.</p>
<p>Judging from the record itself, it is so fragmented and vaguely unbelievable. With Cao Pi's status, it is not normal to show his deceased queen's pillow to his younger brother for no reason. And Zhi actually wept over it, which is even more difficult to accept as fact. Moreover, the latter part of the story describes Empress Zhen suddenly coming and suddenly leaving, like a ghost, but offering a pearl and responding with a jade pendant, like a human being. Isn't this clearly confessing to fabrication? This story is not mentioned in Chen Shou's "Records of the Three Kingdoms" and Pei Songzhi's detailed and widely cited commentary on the Records of the Three Kingdoms. This is official history, so it can be ignored. Liu Yiqing's "A New Account of Tales of the World," during the Liu Song dynasty, is a collection of anecdotal stories from the Wei and Jin periods. It records many deeds of the Cao family, even narrating Cao Pi's acquisition of Empress Zhen in the "Confusion" section. However, this story is not mentioned at all. Liu Xiaobiao's commentary on it, citing extremely detailed sources, also does not mention it. This book, which is praised for "collecting the best events and anecdotes and being extremely wonderful," did not even record such a wonderful story. This proves that this legend did not exist before Liu and Yi, or that they considered the legend unreliable.</p>
<p>According to the "Records of Wei" in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Empress Zhen was born in the fifth year of Guanghe (182 AD), while Cao Zhi was born in the third year of Chuping (192 AD), ten years younger than Empress Zhen. Cao Cao entered Ye, and Cao Pi obtained Empress Zhen—who was originally the wife of Yuan Xi—Cao Pi obtained her when Cao Cao conquered the neighboring territory—in the ninth year of Jian'an (204 AD). At that time, Cao Zhi was only thirteen years old. It would be a miracle for a thirteen-year-old child to be "displeased" because his older brother obtained a married woman who was ten years older than himself. Moreover, it is even more unthinkable that he would be "thinking of her day and night, neglecting his duties and forgetting to eat."</p>
<p>Cao Zhi went to court and wrote the ode in the fourth year of Huangchu. According to the records of official history, this was precisely when Cao Pi was suspicious and suppressed Cao Zhi and other princes meticulously. When Zhi went to see the emperor, because he had been reported two years earlier by the Supervising Attendant Bu Zhi for "drunkenness, rudeness, and coercing the envoy," he confessed his guilt, "with his head uncovered, carrying a hatchet drill, and barefoot. The emperor still had a stern expression and did not speak to him, nor did he allow him to wear a hat and shoes." Zhi lay on the ground weeping, and it was only because the Empress Dowager was unhappy that the emperor allowed him to resume his royal robes. After seeing the emperor and bidding farewell to the court to return east, Cao Zhi and his brother, the Prince of Baima, wanted to travel together to express their mutual feelings, but the Supervising Attendant did not allow it either (either at the emperor's instruction or at the attendant's implied wish). Zhi then angrily bid farewell and wrote seven poems to the Prince of Baima, full of sorrow and melancholy. Is it possible that Cao Pi would show him the pillow and give him the pillow with intimacy between these two events?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the ode itself, the woman described in that passage of transcendent writing, "flying like a startled swan, graceful like a swimming dragon...", is truly only supposed to exist in heaven. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Empress Zhen was already forty years old when she was given death by Cao Pi in the sixth month of the second year of Huangchu because she was frustrated and had complaints, and her children were already growing into adults. To say that the goddess of the Luo River, whom Zhi wrote in the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River two years later, was so graceful and beautiful, was an allusion to her, is also difficult to believe.</p>
<p>So, what was the ode actually written for? He Yimen said: "In the Li Sao, it says, 'I ordered Feng Long to ride the clouds to seek where Mi Fei is.' Since Zhi was not favored by the ruler, he crossed the Luo River to write this ode, entrusting his words to Mi Fei (daughter of Fuxi, who drowned in the Luo River and later became the Goddess of the Luo River), conveying the ambition of Qu Yuan!" This statement is certainly somewhat stale, comparing beauties to monarchs and fragrant herbs to gentlemen throughout history. However, in light of the historical fact that Cao Zhi was not favored by the ruler before and after writing the ode, and in the absence of other more reliable statements, it is still more credible.</p>
<p>No wonder Ding Yan of the Qing Dynasty pointed out that the so-called "record" quoted by Li Shan was a "short story," and also criticized Li Shan for "not discussing the original meaning, but quoting it indiscriminately."</p>

<p>It was a clear day, early in the morning, I walked from Yanggong Bridge towards Xiaolongkan. The air was, of course, fresh, and the morning light and sky had an indescribable beauty of new life; the wilderness scenery was even more fresh and lovely! On both sides of the road, there were endless green grass and rice fields. In that green grass, not far from my sight, I suddenly saw a small, lovely little blue flower. In that green, she beckoned me to come closer and take a closer look: it was a kind of sky blue, but that kind of sky blue was so unique, so elegant, and so sweet-guest! But, no one knows! I looked around, only that lonely flower, there was no second flower identical to her nearby. Looking at her beautiful and lonely little shadow, my heart was filled with love and pity. The wilderness is big, the green is deep and wide, the wind blows ruthlessly, 折 (I don't understand this word) is terrible. Perhaps in the dark night, there are also trampling and devastation by wild beasts. I suddenly had a realization: thinking of people; a lonely girl who needs to be independent, living in the treacherous sea of people, beauty may invite misfortune, and wisdom may be the root of pain. I could not help but lightly took a breath.</p>
<p>"How adorable, and how pitiable!"</p>
<p>I wanted to pick her and take her home, carefully placing her in a vase on my desk, protecting her, cherishing her; letting my sincerity warm and comfort her, cultivating her with my emotions, and nurturing her. But as my fingers just stretched out, suddenly another idea flooded into my heart:</p>
<p>"When she leaves her roots and cuts off the nutrients in the soil, wouldn't it be sending her weak vitality to her premature death in order to love her!" So, my outstretched fingers weakly retracted.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, God is telling her to grow like this, the Creator has arranged it like this for her, her fate is destined to grow here, to grow in this wilderness, in this soil."</p>
<p>Thinking this way, I could only let her live alone and lonely there. I left, I stepped forward, leaving with attachment but without picking her. No one knew how far-reaching the sorrow in my own heart, my love-pity, and my heartlessness were! On that long journey, I silently recited such sentences in my heart:</p>
<p>Little blue flower!</p>
<p>Your sweet smile</p>
<p>Beautiful sky blue</p>
<p>Makes me happy!</p>
<p>Although you are alone</p>
<p>In that green patch,</p>
<p>You are lonely,</p>
<p>But I, little blue flower!</p>
<p>Yet from your lovely little face</p>
<p>I see the simple beauty of life,</p>
<p>Little blue flower!</p>
<p>That doesn't need any pity or caress...</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a kind of helpless self-consolation for myself? — Little blue flower! How could your soul transform into a goddess to come before me, to explain and answer me!</p>

<h3>Supplement to Wall Poetry Collection</h3>
<p>— Beihai</p>
<p>Passing Through Florence</p>
<p>Leisurely, I once arrived at an ancient famous city,</p>
<p>A scene of streams and mountains entered my daytime vision;</p>
<p>Swift currents carry sand with a rustling wind,</p>
<p>Tall forests float emerald, crows caw;</p>
<p>The poignant Divine Comedy lasts for millennia,</p>
<p>The beautiful city of flowers appears distinct today,</p>
<p>I wanted to alight and visit the relics,</p>
<p>But only heard a few sounds of departure flutes in the desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>Half a lifetime spent in a declining homeland,</p>
<p>Two days in a light carriage making a magnificent journey;</p>
<p>Riding atop the mountain peaks to view the troubled world,</p>
<p>Along the Jian Guan Lake, befriending the sand gulls;</p>
<p>Temporarily using famous wine as a substitute for yellow wine,</p>
<p>Almost learning from the Qi's victorious, the Chu's imprisoned;</p>
<p>Alas, I must restlessly travel again,</p>
<p>How can one stay long in a foreign land?</p>
<p>Instant Matters in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Sixteen years after passing through Hong Kong again,</p>
<p>A favorable wind blew dreams before my parents;</p>
<p>Family fortunes scattered in the chaos of the world, without a trace,</p>
<p>My body, like tumbleweed, drifted to the seaside;</p>
<p>How could I not long to return home, yet fear letters,</p>
<p>Adding even more sorrow to my poems;</p>
<p>This journey is not concerned with rise and fall,</p>
<p>Fleeing to the wilderness on a white horse is not yet the case.</p>
<p>Crossing the Yellow River</p>
<p>Sparse shadows of coldness reflected on the Yellow River,</p>
<p>My horse falters, feeling the fleeting waves;</p>
<p>Throwing down the pen, troubled by today's affairs,</p>
<p>Casually, it should be more than a hundred years;</p>
<p>It's difficult for a beauty to inscribe the Yanran stone,</p>
<p>A brave man might as well sing the Yishui song;</p>
<p>Remotely imagining the dressing table with poems in hand,</p>
<p>With a whip, I have already crossed the Tuo River!</p>
<p>Brother Beihai is about to enter Beijing, and I inscribe these poems to bid him farewell. I admire his temporary elegance and profound insights, and I display them on the plain wall. The next day, Mr. Yiqiao visited, but Brother Beihai had already left Bai Xia. Suddenly seeing the poems on the wall, as if facing an old friend, he immediately sent a letter of regards, expressing deep appreciation. The above listed poems on passing through Florence, etc., are all impromptu verses, the meaning following the brush, flowing clearly in the ink, elegant and graceful. Reading them makes one feel deeply immersed in foreign lands, without needing to travel far to the city of water and the city of flowers to experience them. Recorded and noted by Meng Nong in June of the thirty-sixth year.</p>
<h3>Love and Other Things</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>A play with booming gongs and drums, those squeezed in the middle want to get out, and those outside want to squeeze in. Thus, there is chaos all around. Those squeezed out are like a group of homeless wanderers lingering on the streets, and those squeezed in are working hard to move forward. Those on stage, dressed in colorful clothes, are sending seductive smiles with charming eyes, and the gongs and drums are beating tightly;</p>
<p>However, the clamor is not as energetic as before. Afterwards, only a worn-out set of props and a few wooden sticks remain.</p>
<p>Despair</p>
<p>In the desert, the wind blows, making it hard for people to open their eyes, but it is enough to seep into the heart.</p>
<p>Joy</p>
<p>Night, a night without a moon or stars, the night traveler is waiting for some light to guide the way.</p>
<p>The night traveler is hard-working, often losing his way in deep valleys, but he finally reaches "Hope".</p>
<p>With more night travelers, impassable roads become broad avenues. We are now walking on the roads they have traveled.</p>
<p>City</p>
<p>At night, the city implies debauchery and shame. Neon lights flash with mysterious and alluring rays, and melodious music emanates from dance halls and bars.</p>
<p>Jazz is enough to make people forget everything.</p>
<p>Don't you have a restless heart yearning for a way out?</p>
<p>However, next to the big companies lie a group of beggars, and a few old and sick people are making low moans...</p>
<h3>Tree</h3>
<p>— Lao Kai</p>
<p>In front of my door is an unnamed tree, which has already grown to the point where it can no longer be more luxuriant. In the clear peace of the dawn breeze, it shakes its head, disturbing a head of thick, unkempt long hair.</p>
<p>At noon, it is silent, occasionally emitting sigh-like light breaths under the golden sunlight. When sleepiness comes, it listlessly lays down a pile of shadows on the sidewalk; tired shadows, as if still evaporating pale heat like cooking smoke.</p>
<p>When dusk quietly arrives, its tall and bloated figure is smeared with a hazy, melancholic blackness. At this time, it is less like a spire peeking in all directions, and more like a trembling ghost dressed in black mourning clothes.</p>
<p>Every day, I lean against the door and gaze at it, and I stroll beside it alone. Due to the frequency of seeing each other, a feeling of intimacy arises naturally.</p>
<p>Once, as I was walking past it, I suddenly noticed a few yellow leaves falling from its top. At first, I was quite suspicious—it's summer now! Afterwards, I suddenly understood: this is the principle of "metabolism", new leaves replace the position of the remaining leaves, which are crowded out by the new leaves. It is a transformation of new life.</p>
<p>I raised my head and looked at those deep green, lustrous and fertile leaves, as dense as an umbrella; I then lowered my face and looked at those withered and haggard leaves that had long lost the color of life, lying silently in the soil, without a trace of struggling power. In this way, I could not help but be aroused by a cruel pleasure; moreover, I associated it with very distant things.</p>
<p>Let the newly born live quickly, let the not-yet-dead die quickly,</p>
<p>This tree, still an unnamed tree, should be a powerful symbol, should be a tender but unbreakable hope!</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Taiwan History</h3>
<p>— Chi Fu</p>
<p>Great Personage Zheng Chenggong</p>
<p>The history of Taiwan was created by Yanping Prince Zheng Chenggong of the Ming Dynasty. There are many records about Zheng Chenggong, the most important of which are Huang Zongxi's "The Beginning and End of the Imperial Surname," Xu Chongji's "Chronicle of Zheng Chenggong," Yu Zongxin's "Ming Yanping Prince's Maritime Kingdom of Taiwan," and Jiang Risheng's "Unofficial History of Taiwan." During the 50 years of Japanese rule in Taiwan, the Japanese collected a lot of historical materials about the Zheng family, which are now treasured in Taiwan, but no one is taking care of them, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Taiwanese people believe in Zheng Chenggong like they believe in religion. Temples and shrines are built in cities large and small to commemorate this great personage. There is an excellent couplet at the "Yanping Prince Zheng Chenggong Shrine" in Taipei City, which reads: "From scholar to prince, he upheld half of the old country, giving all scholars under heaven a new dignity. Driving out the foreign barbarians, he opened up a new world for thousands of years, wishing that all Chinese with ambition would once again demonstrate their heroic spirit."</p>
<p>Tang Jingsong's Taiwan Democratic State</p>
<p>In 1895 (the 21st year of Guangxu), Li Hongzhang signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan. When the news reached Taiwan, the people were filled with grief and indignation. Tang Jingsong, the Taiwan Governor, was very dissatisfied with the Qing Dynasty's loss of power and humiliation of the country. Therefore, Taiwan jointly elected Tang as the Grand President, with Liu Yongfu, the Director of Defense, as his deputy. On May 2nd of that year, the Taiwan Democratic State was established, with the reign title of Yongqing. The national flag was made, a rectangular flag with a yellow tiger on a blue background, the tiger's head facing inward, the tail high and the head low. Upon the establishment of the Democratic State, Tang Jingsong personally drafted a proclamation, which was filled with blood and tears, and was the earliest document in China advocating democracy and independence.</p>
<p>Tang Jingsong was from Guangxi. His support from the Taiwanese people shows that Taiwan was not exclusive in the past. The Taiwan Democratic State only had a history of twelve days before the Japanese military directly invaded Taiwan; however, the Taiwanese people's perseverance and unyielding will have not diminished to this day. Today, Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian founded "Jingsong Middle School" in Guangxi to commemorate this great democratic hero.</p>
<p>Qiu Fengjia's Indignation</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Taiwan Democratic State, it was Qiu Fengjia who ran around and appealed with all his might, and actively advocated independence. He was a wise man with both talent and integrity. After the Japanese army occupied Taiwan, Qiu Fengjia left Taiwan in a sorry state and composed six poems expressing his grief, patriotism, revenge, indifference, and tranquility. Later generations should read it as a document and as good literature. The full text of the six poems of leaving Taiwan is copied below:</p>
<p>"The prime minister has the power to cede land, and a lonely minister is powerless to turn the tide. Knowing that I will become a barbarian, my heart is dimmed by the loss of the country and its mountains!</p>
<p>Hide the military strategies for now, and stop talking about being a halberd-holding official in the Chengming Palace. What did the bearded man ultimately achieve? A carpenter's square in the palace resembles Xianyang.</p>
<p>It is impossible to know if we can make a comeback, and the country must also be held by great men; how many worthy sons have achieved fame? Who will raise the banner of righteousness on the sea?</p>
<p>From now on, I fear that the Central Plains will sink, and the Eastern Zhou is even weaker than it is today; I will go into the mountains with a cold eye to observe the situation, and I am deeply moved by the thorns and bronze camels.</p>
<p>A hero who retreats is a god, eliminating anger and cultivating morality; I am not a god, but I will dwell in the sword gorge, and ascend to heaven after all enemies are beheaded.</p>
<p>It is difficult for flesh and blood to reunite in troubled times, and brothers are sad to part; I will serve my parents and live as a fisherman and woodcutter, and famous mountains everywhere can be a place to stay."</p>
<p>What emotionally rich and full of national will poems! The 50 years of revolutionary struggle of the Taiwanese people is precisely the manifestation of "It is impossible to know if we can make a comeback, and the country must also be held by great men"!</p>
<h3>Old Poetry Collection</h3>
<p>— Hai Ruo</p>
<p>"Long drought meets sweet rain, meeting an old friend in a foreign land; the bridal chamber with candles on a lonely night, the moment of being named on the gold list." This poem is widely circulated, and everything in it is joyful, so someone titled it the Four Joys Poem. It is also known as the Poem of Triumph.</p>
<p>In the Wuchen year of the Longqing reign of the Ming Dynasty, Wen Zhengchun of Houguan passed the imperial examination and was selected for the Imperial Academy. One day, he met Wang Duinan of Shanyin, who used the above poem to tease him, saying that the four joys only have five characters, which is not enough to be joyful, and each should add two characters. He said: "Ten years of prolonged drought finally meets sweet rain, thousands of miles away from home, one meets an old friend; a monk is in the bridal chamber on a candlelit night," Before he finished speaking, Duke Wen laughed loudly and said: "Isn't the next sentence 'A teaching official is named on the gold list'?" Those who heard it roared with laughter.</p>
<p>There are also some who, for the sake of good fun, created a contrasting version, titled Poem of Disappointment. The sentences are: "A widow returns home carrying her crying child, a general is captured by the enemy; a palace maid loses favor, a person who fails the examination disappoints people." The state of sadness and joy is truly very different.</p>
<p>In ancient times, to become an official, one had to pass the imperial examination to be considered a legitimate path. Therefore, there was a saying "Thirty is old to be a mingjing, fifty is young to be a jinshi," which shows the general difficulty of it.</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, there was a child student who was almost seventy years old and had not yet entered school. The education commissioner Fa sympathized with his old age, so he bestowed him a xiucai. He also wrote a pagoda song, saying: "Old man, old child student, his luck is good, with disheveled white hair, he is the great-grandfather's older brother." Although the words are false, they also show the hardships of the imperial examination field.</p>
<h3>New Chinese Typewriter</h3>
<p>— Da Ming</p>
<p>Due to the invention of the English typewriter, they saved a lot of manpower and time. This made us think of designing a Chinese typewriter to replace the thousands of copyists in government offices. However, Chinese characters are individual squares, unlike Western languages, which are combined from letters, so it is very difficult. Moreover, there are many Chinese characters. According to the codebook of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau, there are more than nine thousand characters. Ordinary dictionaries contain more than ten thousand characters, and university dictionaries contain more than fifteen thousand characters. It is impossible to cast them into lead types and put them on a typewriter. If they are divided into left, right, top, and bottom blocks to combine strokes, the size will be limited. Many people in the country have researched it, but so far there is no completely satisfactory typewriter. However, a typewriter designed recently under the guidance of Dr. Lin Yutang is much more advanced.</p>
<p>As early as 1929, Mr. Zhou Houkun of the Commercial Press had placed lead types in a movable barrel, imitating the Japanese typewriter method. Later, it was improved by Mr. Wang Yunwu and Mr. Hong Weilian of Yenching University. It has a plate containing 2,500 ordinary printed lead types. The typist must be very familiar with this plate, otherwise typing will not be as fast as writing.</p>
<p>In 1945, under the leadership of Dr. Lin, this Chinese typewriter designed in the United States is now widely used, but the Commercial Press has not yet produced it. He first abandoned the classification using the index of ordinary Chinese dictionaries and completely used eye lines as the standard, regardless of whether the strokes were written first or last. There are thirty-six keys on the machine representing the top part of the character (highest), and twenty-eight keys representing the bottom part of the character (lowest). The combination of the top and bottom parts has one thousand and eight different combinations, with an average of four characters in each category. When typing, pressing down the top part and the bottom part of the character will cause a "window" on the machine to display the characters that can be contained by the combination of these two keys. This "window" also indicates the position of the character in the category of characters. There are eight printing keys under the machine, which are used to type the character according to its position in the window. Since there are one thousand and eight categories, each category has a "first place", and the character in the first place is the most commonly used character. Those who are not familiar with it can also type by looking at the window. If there are characters with left and right radicals, they are typed separately on the left and right sides, and the remaining full characters are typed. There are a total of six thousand lead types in the machine, which are installed in a cylinder that is six and three-tenths inches long and four and five-tenths inches in diameter. The lead types are arranged in circles on six movable small cylinders in this cylinder. When a key is pressed, any character on the cylinder can be moved to the printing position. Characters with a left radical need to be pressed five times, and the rest are pressed three times. However, when the character used is not formed by left and right radicals, such as "我" (I), "人" (person), "為" (for), "立" (stand), "坐" (sit), "來" (come), "去" (go), "水" (water), "天" (sky), "團" (group), "家" (family), "弟" (brother), "兄" (older brother), "文" (writing)... etc., there are more than seven hundred. The other three hundred commonly used characters with left and right radicals are also typed "three times" for the full character. For example, in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, there are one hundred and forty-five characters, only twenty-five of which have left and right radicals, but only three of them need to be typed "five times" for the left and right parts, and the remaining one hundred and forty-two characters are typed as the full character.</p>
<p>There are a total of eight thousand empty positions on the machine. In addition to these six thousand lead types, the two thousand remaining are prepared to add English letters (and a few special Russian and French letters), Japanese letters, and extremely rare characters in ancient Chinese books. In this way, this typewriter is complete. The typist can simultaneously press down the top and bottom keys with both hands, and then press down the printing key. The key also advances the paper by one space, both vertically and horizontally. Not only compared to the English typewriter, there are many shortcomings, it is not fast enough, and it is not easy to master, but these are engineering problems. We hope that people with aspirations will conduct more research, and there will be more advanced typewriters in the future.</p>
<h3>"Freedom" Talk</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tong</p>
<p>Bertrand Russell said: "A country cannot exist properly without freedom." Berlin Pollock also said: "Freedom is to a group as health is to an individual's body. Without health, people have no happiness to enjoy, and without freedom, society has no happiness to enjoy." Everyone in the world has the special privilege of being able to do things themselves. People need freedom, and no one wants their special privilege of freedom to be deprived. Throughout history, many small and weak nations have endured the greatest pain, forged an iron will, and finally roared, resisted, and fought for the special altar of freedom from the blood and tears of revolution.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>"Good! We elect Old Lu!"</p>
<p>But Lu Qian tried hard to decline, no matter how much he was persuaded, he would not agree. Finally, Lao Zhu said to him like this:</p>
<p>"Old Lu, everyone used to laugh at you for being too pessimistic, only knowing how to complain and sigh. You often felt that this was an insult. Today, now that we've reached this point, don't you want to prove that you are not a cowardly pessimist?"</p>
<p>These few words stirred up the lame Lu.</p>
<p>"Okay! But I have a few words to say first." His face flushed, somewhat overexcited, and he could hardly speak the first few words. "If you really want to elect me as the leader, then I simply don't want to lead everyone to flee like homeless dogs!"</p>
<p>His words startled everyone, and twenty or thirty pairs of eyes all focused on his unusually ordinary face.</p>
<p>"We are also people, also dignified citizens. I couldn't stand being chased like this, fleeing in the face of the enemy! Life has death since ancient times. Why are we so afraid of the devils? And a nation like us, without organization or vigor, no matter where you flee, people will still come after you! Do you really want to escape to the Himalayas?"</p>
<p>The pent-up anger in Lu Qian's chest for several years was truly vented today; Zhu Zhaonian tilted his face, smiling silently, temporarily forgetting everything about the invitation.</p>
<p>"Before, it was only us fighting the Japanese devils with our lives, and we could barely justify losing. Now that someone has come to help, and we are still so hopeless!" He raised an arm with a clenched fist, waving it above his head, like an excellent speaker. "After fighting for so long, we still haven't recovered an inch of land, and we still insist on saving face, talking about dispersion, advancing, retreating,抢运... refusing to say a word of defeat, it's simply shameless!..."</p>
<p>Many guests on the platform also gradually crowded around them.</p>
<h3>The Zou Yuechang Case and Others</h3>
<p>— Lu Dan</p>
<p>The case of Zou Yue'e, a female teacher from Tongli Town, Wujiang, Jiangsu, who was raped to death, has now shocked the entire country. It is said that women's groups in Wujiang have also submitted a complaint to the highest authorities. The town once went on strike, and primary school students were also shocked, frightened, and angry when they heard that their teacher had died so tragically. According to yesterday's Ta Kung Pao, three suspects in uniform have been arrested locally. The captain of the military officer's brigade has also issued an order to severely punish those who run rampant and act recklessly. This matter has become a big issue, although it has exposed the evil deeds of the murderers, causing women across the country to cry out in unison for Zou Yue'e's tragic death, but paper cannot contain fire. It is more necessary to study it as a typical rape and murder case, to find ways to prevent similar tragedies from happening elsewhere, and to severely punish the murderers, so as to prevent the troublemakers from having a precedent to follow, and so on.</p>
<p>If this can be done, then the death of one Zou Yue'e will win the lives of hundreds of Zou Yue'es. For Zou Yue'e herself, although she may die with her eyes unclosed, she will ultimately find a way out for her sisters who are also trapped in the quagmire.</p>
<p>In a world where bestiality is rampant, the fate of women is originally tragic. Being raped, killed, robbed, trafficked, insulted... this is the "duty" of most women. In some areas, the value of a girl may not even be worth two or three catties of pork. The most pitiful are those weaker individuals with a bit of beauty. Like goods, they become the spoils of people. The aristocratic playboys and lechers do not allow a chaste woman to be by their side. They have special preferences, and there are not many who dare to resist them, let alone if you are just a weak woman. Zou Yue'e was an extremely self-respecting woman, and this "self-respect" happened to be extremely hated by the lechers, so it became the main reason for Zou Yue'e's murder. "If you cannot fight for it by force, then you will not hesitate to destroy it." The murderers in the Tongli Town tragedy can be said to have firmly adhered to this dogma.</p>
<p>Similar to the Tongli Town tragedy but with a different outcome is the case of Shi, a company commander in Peilei Town, Southern District, Yiwu, who forced Yang Chunhua, a weak woman, to be raped at gunpoint. Although Yang Chunhua escaped from the tiger's den and appealed to the press, gaining the sympathy of the Yiwu police chief, county magistrate, youth league secretary, and other local officials, it was still to no avail. "A few days ago, the woman's family members, unable to bear the man's threats, rushed to the county town, and her seventy-year-old grandmother and biological mother knelt before her, begging her to endure the humiliation for the sake of their lives and the lives of the entire family..." Yang Chunhua re-entered the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>A small company commander unexpectedly has so much power. Does this situation illustrate "weapons first" or confirm that the remaining feudal forces in China cannot be underestimated?</p>
<p>A. Gide mentioned the story of aquatic creatures in the sea in "The Counterfeiters":</p>
<p>"Some fish cannot survive in water that is too salty or too fresh, while other fish are just the opposite. They can adapt to all levels of saltiness, so they wait at the edge of less salty currents, waiting for those fish that cannot withstand it to drift over and swallow them all..."</p>
<p>Aquatic creatures in the sea are like this, and humans are no exception. The likes of company commander Shi are just cunning fish that are better able to adapt to the feudal situation in China.</p>
