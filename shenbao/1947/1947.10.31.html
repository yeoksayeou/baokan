<h3>康省共產黨員　限期登記脫黨　否則一律予以逮捕</h3>
<p>〔本報雅安卅日電〕康省保安司令部決定，該省各地或外來新舊加入之共黨及其工作人員，凡願遵照辦理脫離該黨手續者，限於十一月十五日以前自動覓取保證，逕向該管縣政府申請登記，否則即由當地治安機關一律予以逮捕。</p>
<h3>修正要點</h3>
<p>第一章總則，除二八兩條外，餘無修正。第二條第二項關於雜誌之定義原文爲：「雜誌指用一定名稱，其刊期每星期或隔三月以下之期間繼續發行者而言，但其內容以登載時事爲主要者，仍視爲新聞紙」。修正條文如下：「雜誌指用一定各稱，並裝訂成本，其刋期在六日以上三月以下之期問繼續發行者而言。」該款原有之但書，經此次修改刪除。第八條規定出版品於發行時應行分別呈繳之若干機關，此條經修正後，分爲第十六條及第十九條分別列入第二三兩章，而修正案之第八條。一係新增條文，內容如下：「外籍人民得依本法規定聲請發行出版品，並遵守中國關於出版品之一切法令，但該外籍人民之本國出版法，對於中國人民有差別待遇時應不享受本法所給予之待遇。」此一條文係以國際問之平等與互惠原則爲基礎，無待贅述。</p>
<p>第二章關於新聞紙及雜誌之登記主要修正，涉及第九條修正後之條文，將申請發行報紙或雜誌之核准期間减少一倍以上於此足見政府當局便利出版事業之意。原文所有「內政部於發給發記證後應將登記聲請書抄送中央宣傳部」一段，亦經刪除。蓋自訓政結東之後關於出版法之實施，業已完全移歸政府機關辦理，政黨機構不復參與。第九條原文第一段規定；「爲新聞紙或雜誌之發行者，應由發行人於首次發行前塡具聲請書，呈由發行所所在地之地方主管官署，於十五日內轉呈省政府或直隸於行政院之市政府核准後，始得發行；省政府或直隸於行政院之市政府，接到前項登記聲請後，除特別情形外，應於二十八日內核定之，並轉請內政部發給登記證。」修正後之條文將「十五日」及「廿八日」均改爲「十日」，使核定期間縮短一倍以上，並將「除特別情形外」一句改爲「經審核與規定相符者」，以求文字之明確。至於該第九條後段關於登記聲請書應載明之事項，除增加「發行旨趣」一項外，餘皆依照原規定，並無修正。</p>
<p>第二章第十二條規定：「新聞紙中專以發行通訊稿業者，地方主管官署於必要時得派員檢查其社務組織及發行狀况。」經修正後，此條業已刪除，藉以充分保障新聞事業不受任何非必要之行政干涉。第十三至十六各條，因第十二條之被刪除，依次推進，改爲第十二至十五條。原第十四條即修正條文之第十三條第一項所定：「一因違反第廿一條之規定受刑事處分者，」改爲「一因違反第廿一條第二十二條之規定受刑事處分者」，該第甘二條詳第四章係新滑條文。此外，第二章原有各條之規定未加修改。</p>
<p>第三章關於書籍及其他出版品，原有第十八條至第廿條等三條，第廿條規定「有關政治之傳單或標語非輕地方主管官署許可，不得印刷發行」。此條業已刪除，以符言論自由之精神。此外，另加一條第十九條，規定書籍發行時，應由發行者分送內政部，國立中央岡書館及北平圖書館各一份。現行出版法第八條規定一切出版品皆須分送若干機關，不加區別，修正案則按出版品之性質，分別規定，藉以减少書籍發行人應行分送之册數。（下接二版一欄）</p>
<h3>經會商管制物價　對燃料管制作七項決議　產區煤價增百分之四十</h3>

<p>〔又電〕全經會開會時，有關方面所提物價調查報吿，曾於會中宣讀，據調查，物價上漲原因有下列數端：經政府機關管制物價未能協調，如紡調會即首先領導漲價；　外匯牌價時時變動；　香港走私及因「通天證」所引起之波動；　東北華北游資集中者數逾二百億，國行對頭寸未能收縮。</p>
<h3>讓售國營事業　組銀團募股案　全經會決定重付審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國營事業採發行股票方式，由銀行組織銀團經募一案，全經會卅日會中會提出討論，決定重付審查，可望於下次大會討論。該案係趙棣華所擬，理由爲國營事業讓出後，可吸收游資，收縮通貨，人民有投資購買機會，符合公平公開原則，其具體辦法如次：（下接二版五欄）</p>
<h3>英訪華團抵渝　行前在漢招待記者</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口卅日電〕英國會訪華團，卅日晨十時在漢舉行記者招待會，團長亞蒙動爵首先聲明，渠等談話不能代表政府，旋與阿穆里勳爵分別答復記者詢問，渠等盛讀北平之雄偉及台灣之美麗。談及內河航權問題，仍望我政府能予開放。對香港問題則拒作答覆，僅稱：願與我協力制止香港走私。午後二時一行乘原機飛渝，約勾留二日，即轉道香港返國。又徐市長，曾以「林下雙虎圖」湘繡一幅贈該團，作臨別紀念。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶卅日電〕英國會訪華團，卅日午後五時半飛抵渝，當晚拜會行轅主任朱紹良，卅一日赴黃山之戰時主席官邸，並擬參觀各防空洞。</p>
<h3>內部選總通令　嚴禁選舉舞弊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕內政部及選叫通令各省選所，略稱：競選人員如有買通地方惡勢力，把持選舉及宴客，饋贈或利用金錢企圖當選之情事，實足以敗壞風俗，曲抑人材，應立即有效制止，情節重大者，除依法取消其候選人資格外，並應運同其有關人犯移送法院予以處罰。</p>
<h3>南昌台北地震</h3>
<p>「本報南昌卅日電〕卅日晨五一時另三分，此間發生地震，屋宇震動，杯盤作響，經過時間約十秒鐘。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北卅日電〕本巿卅日晨一時卅八分卅三秒七發生有感徵震，共歷四分廿二秒九，最大震幅爲一點三公厘，震源係在日月潭附近。</p>
<h3>現任產委參加競選　各政黨應予支持　立法院會通過臨時動議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕立法院卅日晨擧行三三七次例會，孫兼院長主持，以全部時間討論各種有關選舉案件。首先提出討論者，爲立委劉盥訓等臨時動議，建議「擬由立院大會議決，請國民政府通知各政黨，將現任立委除自願放棄競選者外，一律由各政黨提各支持爲立法委負候選人」。此案討論時，國民黨籍立委踴躍陳詞，民，靑兩黨立委亦發言支持。僉認現任立委咸爲饒有經驗，學識豐富之專家，不應將其擯棄，同時，現任立委均係經過政治會議，國防最高委會及國防會議遴選後正式任命者，今旣由政黨提名，故立委應在各政黨支持名單之內，同時，各國國會每屆改選大都保留舊議員之一部份，即使現任立委全體當選，亦尙不及總額五分之一，且立法委員有繼續性，技術性，現任立委應被提名爲他日立委候選人，最後無異議通過。</p>
<h3>女立委候選人　不應濫竽充數</h3>
<p>繼討論立委譚惕吾等所提，女性立委應址學識經驗社會地位爲標準，而不應以私人關係濫竽充數，建議國府通知各黨，於提出候選人名單時，注意此點，原提案人譚傷吾說明時，指出各地所提女性立委候選人良券不齊，學歷經歷威有問題，且往往憑藉私人關係產生，而不重視才具，此次選舉，關係我今後憲政前途極巨，對於此種現象，應予注意。鍾天心等則認內舉不避親，如眞有才具，親戚故舊亦不妨提出，最後照原案通過。</p>
<p>嗣又通過　修正國民大會代表及立委選罷法施行條例，當選證書式樣及說明選舉票式設明案，　自由職業新聞記者·律師·技師·會計師·醫藥師等五團體候選人簽署人數核减爲至少五十人案。</p>
<p>最後，討論綏靖區國大代表及立委選舉困難補救辦法，審查時，曾草擬一國代立委選舉補充條例草案，今日會中討論時，對於綏靖區收復後，其代表應否再行選舉，爭執頗烈，多數北方立委咸認旣選出後，不必再選，以擾地方。孫院長等則指出，人民有一選舉及被選舉權，不能予以剝奪，決議重付審查。（國代選罷法等修正條文刊二版二欄）</p>

<h3>論社　緬甸獨立與中緬關係</h3>
<p>自印度及巴基斯坦獲得獨立後，緬甸民族也積極走向獨立，完成了歷史上又一次不流血革命。據倫教消息：緬甸代表團在總理牛泰眞領導下，於十月十七日與英首相又德禮，簽訂了英緬條約，規定明年一月英國將政權移交獨立之新緬甸政府。廿四日英議會開會，艾德禮提出緬甸獨立法案，順利完成立法手續。英緬甸事務大臣李斯杜威爾，於廿六日正式公佈「緬甸獨立法案」與「英緬條約」，法案內容規定自明年一月六日起，緬甸即成爲一獨立國家，卽非英自治領之一部，亦不受英保獲。條約內容承認緬甸共和聯邦爲一究全獨立之主權國家，雙方任命適當之外交代表，英緬甸事務部亦於明年一月六日結束；同時規定英緬軍事關係，英國享有離務上之特殊利益，緬甸不得接受任何一國之防務代表，至英緬貿易關係，則採用互惠辦法，此與美菲條約關係相同。但無論如何，這是一樁別具新義的歷史事件。開明的英國政府，實踐了放棄殖民地政策的諾言，爲大西洋憲章精神增加了光彩；而緬甸民族繼印度及巴基斯坦不流血革命過程中，完成了民族解放和民族獨立的使命，同樣値得吾人的慶祝。</p>
<p>緬甸位於馬來亞半島最窄的地方，其大陸邊疆與我國唇齒相依。據一九四〇年國聯年鑑統計：緬甸面積有二六一。六一〇方哩，人口有一千六百萬，包括緬甸人。卡洛林人。撞人。印人及中國人，其與　　印度交通，僅有仰光爲主要活動港口。緬甸民族爲東南亞最富於活力的民族，且習於耕作，早有亞洲「極樂之域」之稱。這個勤勞的民族，有他古老的歷史；公元第六至第七世紀，爲封建貴族個別建立的藩邦，第十一至第十三世紀，封建領生　地位於商人階級，不僅建立巨大的城市，並且與中國南洋發生商務連絡，建立了强大的民族王國。那時，佛教也從印度傳入，文化逐漸發遠，至第十四世紀，仍維持自己的獨立。緬甸在對外關係上，曾打敗蒙古帝國的侵略；直到第十九世紀，三次對英戰爭敗北，　淪爲英帝國的殖民地，緬甸民族悲慘命運便於此時開始。</p>
<p>英帝國認緬甸爲「不列　王冠的珍珠」，爲了印度。香港，及馬來亞的統治，牠必須領有緬甸，同時爲了與法國爭衡遠東，牠不惜投下金鎊經營緬甸。一八八六年緬甸被宣佈爲不列顛帝國的一部，並且併入印度。同時英帝國爲實行「分而治之」的傳統政策，緬甸被分劃上下兩區，樹立幾十個小王國集合而成的揮邦，此與統治印度的技巧相同。一九三七年，曾根據賽門委員會建議，實行印緬分治，直隸英皇管理，內　設緬甸事務部，指導緬甸總督行政；總督下設緬甸議會，分上下兩院。是以緬甸旣非殖民地，亦非自治領，而爲大英帝國半自治的領地。緬甸民族富有活力，他們雖不滿英國統治，然在這次大戰中，却貢獻人力物力於同盟國，幷以領士領空供盟軍對日作戰，縱在日軍佔領下亦有所不屈。大載告終英國工黨執政，緬甸繼埃及印度之後而獨立，不僅爲英國政府賢明的　施，並且是戰後世界政治的必然趨勢。看英政府和議會迅速而眼斷的決定，英　接待牛泰眞的誠　表示，英帝國的王冠雖太去了燦爛的珍珠，但在新英國自力更生的道路上，卻添了世界的友人，更在民族解放運動上，留下人燈最可紀念的一頁。我們對於英國政治家這稱有遠見有魄力的做法，實在覺得可以欽佩。</p>
<p>吾人對緬甸僅得獨立，倍感興奮；未來中緬自主的外交關係，亦必更日有增進，有裨於兩國的安定與繁榮。在歷史上，中緬關係有著很光榮的篇幅；即在地理上地位上，兩國更有患難相共唇齒相依的關係。中緬交界的區域，與滇康毗連有三大江（潞江，瀾滄江，大金沙江），內奄有片馬江心坡諸地，關係我國西南邊疆，亦爲我西南國防的要塞，其得失事關我國命運重大。不幸歷年來界務糾紛，時有發生，致中緬疆界迄未戡定，因之兩國商務往來也缺乏正常。現在緬甸獲得獨立，我國巳與之交換大使，勘界問題亦在進行中，實爲中緬關係好轉之先聲。</p>
<p>吾人慶賀緬甸的獨立，願望緬甸制憲的成功，走向民主自由的大道。亞洲東南的安定與繁榮，擊於未來的中緬的親善。我國古代的世界政策，一貫以「興滅國，　絕世，厚往而薄來」爲理想。放眼一看今日世界，中緬地理上地位上的重要，吾人深深盼望緬甸的新生，選擇中緬合作友好的道路，打破歷年中緬界務糾紛的僵局，進而重建中緬，商務關係。東南亞是慈祥善良的境地，吾人願中緬兩民族友好合作，永遠沐浴在和平與寗靜的慈海裏！</p>
<h3>董顯光談出版法</h3>
<p>（上接一版）第四章，關於出版品登載事項上之限制，除條文次序號數之更變外，內容計修改兩條，增加二條，第廿一條原文規定：「出版品不得爲左列各款言論或宜傳之記載：　意圖破壞中國國民黨或進反三民主義者，　意圖顚覆國民政府或損害中華民國利益者，　意圖破壞公共秩序者。」修正後之條文如下：「出版品不得爲左列各款言論或宣傳之記載：　意圖顚覆政府或危害中華民國者，　妨害邦交者，　意圖損害公共利益或破壞社會秩序者。」修正案之廿二條「新增條文」規定：「出版品不得爲妨害本國或友邦元首名譽之記戰」。第廿四條「新增條文」規定；「出版品不得爲妨礙他人名譽及信用之記載」。第廿一條第二項及第廿二條之增加，旨在促進邦交之敦睦，並對本國及友邦元首表示應有之尊重。出版法除保障言論自由外，並顧及私人名譽之保障，以防誹謗之盛行，故有第廿四條之增加。此外，第四章原文第廿三條即修正案，第廿五條經修正後，於原有規定「出版品不得登載禁止公開訴訟事件之辯論」後，另加「出版品對正在訴訟程序中之事件，不得加以批評」一項，藉以保障司法之尊嚴。修正案之第廿六條，即係原第廿四條，內容並無修改，查其意義係爲政府保留於戰時或遇有變亂時所應有之權，外傳修正之出版法無異恢復新聞檢査制度云云，自非事實。</p>
<p>第五章，行政處分，除條文次序號數之變更外，內容修改者計五條，增加者一條，删除者三條，修正案第卅條（原第廿八條）與第卅六條（原第卅四條），因條文次序號數之變更，以及第四章條文之增加，經修改如次：第卅條，內政部認出版品　有違反第廿一條所列事項之一，或違背弟廿二條及第廿六條所定禁止　限制之事項者，得指明該事項禁止出版品之出　及散布，並得於必要時扣押之。（後段未加修正，與原第廿八條後段同）。</p>
<p>第卅六條，出版品之記載有違反第廿三條，第廿四條，第廿五條之規定情節較爲重大者，內政部或地方主管官署呈經內政部核准後，禁止其出售散布，並得於必要時扣押之。（後段未加修正，與原第卅四條後段同）。此外，第卅七條（原第卅五條）關於發行人一案，規定分送其出版品所應得之處分，現行條文規定罰款卅工，修正後改爲「經催告不理者，處以該出版品定價五十倍以上之罰款」。又第卅八條（原第卅九條）所規定之罰款經修正後，將「一百元」改爲「一千元」，餘無修改。修正條文第卅三條，關於國外發行之出版品，應予禁止進口者，即係原第卅一條，共中不外因有關係文號數之變更，作應有之修改，實質則與原條文完全相同。</p>
<p>現行出版法第卅六，卅七，卅一八等條，內容規定各種罰款，均已全部删除。</p>
<p>第五章，第四十一條規定「逖反本法之規定，除依上開各條分別處罰外，及觸犯刑法規定之罪刑者，依刑法辦理，此條在形式上雖係新增之獨立條文，但現行出版法第卅四條首句亦含同樣之意義。</p>
<p>現行出版法之第六章罰則，計十一條，全部取消，換言之，依照修正草案從事出版事業者，如有違反第四章之規定，共出版品得受行政處分，惟其個人之懲處依刑法辦理，不屬於行政處分範圍，於此，足見政府保障人　與尊重法治精神之意，現行出版法第七章附則，改第六章，內容未加修正。（完）</p>

<h3>民盟在上海的活動</h3>
<p>〔大公社訊〕民盟份子在上海勞工界遵法活動情形，經摘誌如下：</p>
<p>民盟於抗戰勝利後，其首腦份子沈鈞儒，羅隆基，章伯鈞等先後來滬，密囑黨羽，打入上海工界，組織工人協會，　屬於救國會。工協之下，再分公司商號聯誼會，各業大同盟二組織。此外更發展外圍組織，並打入共他集團，如滬東滬西兩工人密集區中之靑年聯合會，光明劇社，和　票房，靑光社，靑年劇團及各婦女補習學校，工人補習　校等。其聯誼會與大同盟雖係民盟組織，而實際上則並受中共上海市工人聯合總會之指揮。在中共未撤退　　工聯總會之負責人李雄翔，管天中，葛其瑛，及中共勞工部負責人華崗，中共職工部負實人柳價臣等，時有指示密令發佈。</p>
<p>民國三十四年冬，工人以物價高昂，紛紛要求調整待遇，於是民盟份子配合時機在各工廠先後鼓動工潮，實現破壞社會，顚覆政府之目的。</p>
<p>三十五年十一月下句民盟在滬東滬西之各工廠中，發動簽名反美運動，尤以頤中福新烟廠，崇信紗廠，淮通毛紡織廠，景倫紗廠，元豐紗廠等爲甚。同時民盟幹部應奇，屢次威脅捲烟女工陳潔如（現任工界參議員），欲其加人民盟，領導反美工作，均爲陳所拒。</p>
<p>本年元且後，　隆基鄧初民及親近民盟之郭沫若等，秘密授意其爪牙陳施君，　武城，丁盛雅等，召開愛用國貨抵制美貨會，　　多月。至今年二月九日，始在勸工大樓召集，當時發生梁仁達血案。</p>

<p>抗戰前二月，有同鄕竺志民，因祝壽法杭，邀請越劇女伶來滬唱堂會，經友人陳榮春之介，識筱丹挂。筱於二十二歲時春天，與我發生關係。我於廿五歲時曾與同鄉女子裘瑞緩（現年卅三歲）在上海孟淵旅館結婚，現育四子二女。筱丹挂現年二十八歲，共妹瓊韻由宋華作媒於去年下半年，與天生綢廠發行所職員王月慶結婚。我每天管理國泰越劇院前台事宜，編劇部亦由我負責。本月七日下午五時左右，我未在家，筱獨自一人出外，直至下午十一時左右始回來。我於是日係下午十二時許返回家。惟於下午六時許，我曾返家一次，因未見筱在，乃問筱妹。據說是午後五時左右出外。當我於十二時許返家，乃問筱到何處去吃夜飯的，據答：「在兪家姆媽家吃夜飯，吃過飯與兪家姆媽同去看電影」。我說：「兪家姆媽在國泰裏看戲，曾經同我在後台談過天」。我細細一想，筏說話不對。筱始終說同兪家姆媽一同看電影，筱說不是，她說是，因此雙方爭執幾句。我一定問下去，結果筱說：「常常寫信來的越劇迷（住江西路五金店的）寫信約我，七日看新光大戲院電影」。我問看後如何，筱說：「看後坐三輪車到金都大戲院」。我間筱說：「夜飯在何處吃的」。筱說：「在金都對面飯店裏吃的」。我問她吃些什麼東西，筱說：「不算點心，不算飯，隨便吃一些」。我說：「我不相信，初次碰頭，沒有二次電影可以看的。」我就勸導她，問她：「你有什麼意思要同道去看電影呢，」筱說：「好奇心」。我說：「不可以的，這樣是要給人看輕的，被人見你倆坐在三輪車上，面子何在呢？戲已不唱了，保留名譽第一」。筱答：「這是不錯的」。口稱「我錯我錯，實在不是這個人」。</p>
<h3>借劉瓊信箱</h3>
<p>我問是誰，向我「好的說，她起身走到寫字台上寫「冷山好兩字。我問：「你們究在何處？」筱說：「只要我身體淸白」。又說。「下午五時左右出去，與冷山到金城看電影學，僱三輸車到火華戲院背後呌汽車一輛到兆轉花園口停落，進馬路，到十點半鐘，獨自僱三輸車回來」。我問：「你們約會是用電話或用信的？」她答：「是用信」。我問：「這信是從那裏通的呢？」她答：「劉瓊的信箱」。我問：「這信箱在何處？」她說：「在馬斯南路」。我問：「談些什麼？」她說：「冷山說交關歡喜我，始終愛我，精神上的愛。我說笑話，我不能同你發生愛，你有婦之夫，和有夫之婦。冷山說他夫婦感情不好。我說你娶進的時候愛她的，現在爲何不愛呢？同你軋軋朋友是可以的，對於愛是絕對不可能的，其餘就談到拍電影的事了」。我問：「冷山講過我沒有？」筱說：「冷山說你沒有意氣，爲人很吝嗇」。我說：「第一次碰面外去，怎麼這樣大胆，已經談到愛的上面去了，你痛痛快快完全講出來」。筱說：「當我做戲每夜下台的時候，是冷山扶我下來，每夜談談說說，發生情感。」我問：「通過幾封信呢？」筱答：「七八封。」我問：「信裏講些什麼？信到那裹去了？」筱說：「你不要來間我，我已經全部說出來了。信中內情，你不要問，我身子絕對淸白。」我說：「他這種悄形完全是引誘你，欺騙你，他有子女的，絕對是在騙你的錢，要你跟他到香港去拍電影。」筱哭着說：「我覺悟了。」我說：「我與編劇部商量，同他講明白，不要來往，我去喚劉濤來。（這時已八日上午十時左右，我倆一夜未睡）」</p>
<h3>找冷山對質</h3>
<p>旋找劉　·吳琛，對吳說：「冷山離間我們，請你講句公正話。」就一同到蘭心戲院附近冷山家中。在車中我對冷說：「你不要離問我們倆夫妻，弄得她難做人，你說些惡形惡狀的話。」到我家，筱擁被坐在床中。我們就坐下，冷山坐我對面。我問冷山，「你要講實話，她昨夜同來吿訴我聽過了。」冷山說：「我昨夜同朋友在金門看戲，有戰票存根可證。」我就說：「你不要說謊，你們在何處約會，何處僱汽車，何處逛馬路，有沒有開過房間，你好好的講，絕對沒有關係。吳先生是你十多年老朋友，你不便直接講，你同吳先生到外間裏去講給吳先生聽好了。」當我用手指他的時候，把他的眼鏡碰歪，他帶帶正，拉我到外間會客室，承認「曾用信約會，在大華戲院背後僱汽車至兆豐公園，後來筱一人僱三　車回來，惟絕對沒有發生關係過。」後來我對冷山中斥一頓，警吿以後不許和筱來往，此事我說過之後，也就算了。不料筱受此刺激，竟萌死志，於十三日下午五時吞服大量來沙爾　殺，急送巾美醫院　救，奈中毒過深，延至六時　　不治身死。這是我想不到的事情。我深深覺得對不住丹桂，懊悔莫及」</p>

<h3>郵匯局職員被控案　地院昨開庭審問　首席稽核對調查結果陳述五點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕郵匯局職員被控舞弊案，昨在地院由吳榮林推事開審，到被吿孔廣曉（立達進出口行董事長），張玖（前郵匯局重慶分局經理，現調上海分局營業處長，專管外匯僑匯），倪樹榮（郵匯局秘書總局儲金處長），王祥號（郵匯局貸款股職員祖任放款對保工作）。被吿沈鏡·兪子鴻·張植榮·吳永年·陳公培·李亮甫·章純一·徐繼莊·彭秉澄等九人未到。嗣並傳訊證人周鈺·烏家善·何嘉裕·方建標（郵匯局總局首席稽核）。首據王祥發供：在郵局最初工作爲辦理文書，從本年八月起迄今，專司管理押匯對保。但整個分局向外對保，是否由我一人辦理，則不詳。立達行押款對保亦是由我辦理，但我祇對保單上印章相同與否，並未調查該保單上資金，貨物數量。而且亦是由科長吿訴我這樣做，我才蓋章。起初我非常懷疑，我不明暸押款對象，爲何要我蓋章，經科長解釋這是業務上的秘密手續，我遂不便再問。此案發生不久，總局會派方首席稽核來查過。張玖供：我在滬分局專管外匯，僑匯，和向四聯總處連絡。當時因爲工作忙，遂請倪樹榮帮忙，因倪爲研究外匯專家。立達行放款是由局長批准的，並面諭辦理。事前立達行經理孔廣曉曾和徐前局長談妥，當時外匯押款利息由我擬定要立達出一分五厘月息，並須有二家舖保。立達貸款數爲美金二百萬，（我並要其繳總數三成以上保證金，立達曾繳付六十萬美金）。倪樹榮稱：外匯部份，頭寸調動我兼理。對立達外匯押款則不知。孔廣曉稱：向郵匯局貸外匯押款是我向徐繼莊接洽，經過一月至三月才吿成功。這筆款我準備向美軍上海淸理處買西藥一萬噸，郵匯局並要我把這筆西藥爲保證，及運同三成中之六十萬美金在內，還淸此筆款項，是從八月份開始直到十二月才還淸，但尙欠十七萬美金，結果以美金公債補還。次傳證人，烏家善稱：曾保管過立達行押款，十二月二十八日奉沈經理（鏡）命令，把押款給孔廣曉。周鈺（會計科職員）曾做過這張傳票，因發生錯誤，乃改王祥發做。何嘉裕（郵匯局上海分避副理）稱：　進局，對此事不十分淸楚。方建標對此案調查結果，提出五點：　外幣押匯部份，上海分局未依規則做。　局中對押匯事須呈准總局才可做，而上海分局朱呈報即做。　押匯貨物根本無此事實。　對此次外匯押款部份，總局會命沈徐解釋，但迄今兩人並朱解釋。　押款超過抵押品價値。審訊結果，因尙有許多證人未到，乃論改期再審。孔廣曉交五家舖保及十億元現金保。張玖四家舖保次四億元保。倪樹榮追加二家舖保及二億元保。王祥發追加二億及二家鋪保云。</p>

<h3>由民營收歸國營的　成渝鐵路全貌　全長五百卅公里工程遠景在望</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿八日航訊〕民國廿五年，成渝鐵路公司一開始成立，便與法國銀國的代表瑪索特（M．Magot）君簽訂了合同。全長五百三十公里的成渝路綫，廿六年就完成了「定綫」測量，法方亦從巴黎運米了第一批四千噸的鐵路材料。材料　預備由香港轉運四川，產溝橋砲火爆發，成渝鐵路的建築即被延擱下來了。成渝鐵路全部</p>
<p>工程的預算在民國六年，根據記者的採訪：是七千五百萬元。今年的預算雖然增加至三百九十億元，主持工務的負責者還在搖頭，喊沒辦法。鄧益光局長因公赴京，聞政院最近批准工程局，從七月份起每月增加一百億。工款有了着落，如果沒有意外的難題，成渝路全部工程可在二年半後完成。由</p>
<p>重慶到內江一段，幷不全沿成渝公路的　道，（請讀者參閱成渝鐵路路踐圖）全段的大橋，山洞，均於廿九年究工。今日的主要工程，是塡路基。因爲邱陵地帶高塡深挖，有達二十公尺之多，計長二百八十公里的渝內段，就需要一萬土石方。重慶至江津段（六十公里）已開工五個月，預定年底完成。江津至板橋段，（七十五公里）開工一月，約明年四月可完工。板橋塲至內江段（一百五十公里），工程局決定十一月十五日開標。但是，板，內段中的隆昌站，局方正在利用美國新運來的機器塡挖工程，試驗一下：究竟僅有的幾部機器比人力迅速到如何的程度！至於</p>
<p>內江至成都一段，則有二百五十公里，（不經過龍泉驛公路的山地）中間必須開闢十三個山洞，建築三十餘座大橋。資中以西，凉風坳隧道，最費工程，因爲需有五百公尺的長度，僅祗開　，都要費一年半的時光。建築橋棵，却不太費力，工程局打算在日內開工，設若情况良好，明年漲水季節以前，可以全部落成。</p>
<p>法國沙班銀國曾爲成渝鐵路的工程事件來過重慶，可是沒有結果。問題是在：如何以美鈔計算法郞外匯。據說：目前法郎亦有黑巿，沙班銀團却希望工程局的國外料款以官價計算。而當局則認爲：如果</p>
<p>向法國訂貨按照法方所訂匯率估價，法國貨將比美國貨貴得多了。這就是遲遲未能簽訂合同的主要原因。</p>
<p>記者有位朋友，去年曾赴美國考察鐵通工程，他在火車製造廠內，遇見一位法國政府的代表，這位法國代表正向美廠洽商訂購車頭。返國後，他就時常懷疑法國工業的生產狀况。記者亦曾爲這個問題向一位法國朋友發問，他很坦白的說道：「果然，法國打過敗仗，但勝利後</p>
<p>恢復得極快假使法國政府與中國政府，因爲成渝路的全部工程簽約成功，法國在簽約後的六個月一定可以如數出貨。」</p>
<p>目前，成渝路已經收回國營，以前的民營股資，政府正絡　退還中。就記者所知道的，全賴國外的工業生產來內地建築一條鐵道，確非易事。川江航運，在漲水全盛時期，運量未曾超過三萬噸，而成渝路單舖一條三十公里長度的鐵道路綫，就需一千噸鋼軌。全長五百三十公里，該要多少輪船，汽車，飛機來配合運輸！</p>
<p>但是，工程局的負責者仍有他的</p>
<p>遠見與抱負在種種困難情形下，非僅要完成一條成渝降，還想修築隆筑段，（由隆昌至貴陽）。如果道段鐵這全部完成，重慶至隆昌反成了支綫。由貴陽，隆昌，達成都，却變爲幹绕，整個西南運輸，頓將改觀。隆筑段全長五百二十公里，工程局已派出四個測量隊，一個踏勘隊正在從事沿綫「初測」的工作。（特派員歐陽醇）</p>

<h3>中國文化發源　英專家在倫敦演講</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿九日電〕查脫萊博士今日在此間中國學會及中國大學委員會，作一頗饒與趣之演講，題為「中國文化之發源及傳佈」。中國駐英大使為該演講會之主席，盛讚查博士對中國知識之豐富。據稱查博士於一九○八年赴華任敎，而彼則於翌年來英攻讀。此後數十年間，查博士會出任有關中國方面之要職，且精硏中國文化。查博士在演詞中，稱數世紀來不斷有人探究中國文化源出西方之說，但各派思想之理論，經考查後均未能成立。其中最普遍之爭論，為中國文化是否源出埃及。此問題之結論，首須決定世界文化究意是否發源於一地，抑或個別在各地獨立發展。博士對每一理論，均作正反兩面之辯說。並稱除非得有廣泛證據，決不能支持任何一面之說法。彼更述及埃及文化可溯源至三千年前，腓尼基文化至二千年前，中國文化亦至二千年前，中部美洲至五百年前。此事實可表示文化係由中東發源，漸向東移，橫貫亞洲及太平洋而至美洲。其間文化方式之不同，表示其有地方性之發展。查博士更指出文化，係由觀念散佈於世界。中國文化，有多方面如磁器·茶·紙·印刷等，皆為單獨發展者，但對發明火藥及指南針之說，尙須待考。彼結論時，稱大部份之中國文化，係由觀念出發。彼更稱：「此種理論，並不在毀謗中國，僅在證明世界文化，惟有在加強並發展各國家間之聯累下，才可得以進步。」</p>

<h3>紡調會第十五次例會　通過收花議價辦法　自明日起先在西安等六區實施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會於昨日下午四時，舉行第十五次例會，由劉泗英主席。首由秘書業務兩處報吿，繼由主席報吿上星期四赴京出席全經會，提供關於花紗布議價及聯合配銷之經過情形，最後討論下列議案：　收花議價辦法案，吳味經，劉攻芸，李升伯，榮爾仁，唐星海等均提出意見，經詳密討論後，該項辦法修正通過。　機器染織業工會擬請參加議價小組案，決議俟實行棉布議價時，再由複製業推派代表一人出席參加。　原料供應小組委員會，聘胡竞良爲該小組主任委員，吳味經，榮一心，劉靖基，中銀央行代表駢福臻，中國農民銀行代表　貞祥，紡調會代表高炳泰，上海市棉花商業公會劉蓀爲美員。　代織布疋辦法案，決議交下次大會討論。</p>
<h3>收花議價辦法</h3>
<p>一，本辦法根據發展紡織工業調節紗布供需實施方案第一章第二節第二條之規定訂定之。</p>
<p>二，收花聯介議價暫定在西安鄭州天津南通漢口沙市等六區先行實施。</p>
<p>三，以上六區應各成立一棉花議價委員會，由中央銀行幼織事業調節委員會棉產改進處中國紡織建設公司巾國農民銀行民營紗廠及棉花商業么會各派代表一人聯合組成，共同議價，並以中央銀行代表爲等一召集人，紡調會代表爲第二召集人。沙市南通未設有中央銀分支機構，由紡調會所派代表負責召集，於必要時，請當地政府派員參加。</p>
<p>四，棉商向原產地農民收花價格，暫以　吋細絨白花一市担之價格，相當於當地中等小麥七市祖（北方）或中等白米四市石（南方）之價格爲準。仍參照當地供求情形及生產成本，隨時議定。其長於或短於　吋之棉花，由紡調會擬定價格，比例標準，列表通知各地議價委員會參考。</p>
<p>五，集散市塲之收花議價，以產地價格爲依據，得酌加運繳費用，惟爲减少中間商人之層層加價，並使議價穩定合理起見，對於運繳費用一項，應從嚴限制。六，棉花攙水攙雜，最為妨礙議價工作，嗣後各地市塲棉花，必須經當地棉花檢驗機關檢驗合格後，始准買賣。</p>
<p>七，各地議價委員會，應每日將所議價格及各廠商收花總數量，用急電報請紡調會備核，如議價未有變動，亦須報吿。</p>
<p>八，對於遠反議價之收花廠商，得由議價委員會請常地政府予以取締．</p>
<p>九，本辦法自卅六年十一月一日起施行，並呈請經濟部備案。</p>
<h3>市上籌碼充斥　棉紗布喊價平疲　四二支藍鳳續降九十萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因隔日紡建大量開出，市上籌碼充沛，更兼月底銀根軋緊，各方需求平淡，廠家反有套賣，客帮袖手不動，喊價步低。結果四二支藍鳳紗比上日續潟九十萬，爲三千二百六十萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，價亦一致再降，自三四十萬至百萬左右。</p>
<p>棉布市况，最開因銀根步緊，客帮仍少活動，行情平穩。迨至十一點半時，聞紗價續挫，人心不振，做價下潟。最後十二磅龍頭等各細布，較上日軋跌五千元，惟五福藍鷄振中數檔見昂五千至一萬。其他各布因實銷不動，市亦平疲無神。</p>
<p>紡建售市</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售五九九〇疋，合單疋六三二〇疋，由購單共六六張，內廠商六張，購布一五二〇疋，布號六〇張，購布四四七〇疋。</p>
<p>現棉平庸</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况平庸，交易零星，趨勢先平後軟，紗廠因棉紗軋小，更因月終發給工資，銀根緊急，納胃甚微，同業進意尙濃，故價格仍站原盤。全日成交八八〇包。送廠價做開沙市三六八萬七千，歸德三二二萬四一千。棧交價　寳三七七萬，山東三三五萬七千，漢細三二二萬四千，海提尖二九七萬六千，沙市三六二萬一千。啓東三二六萬六千，火機二五〇萬，周浦籽花六十萬零五千。</p>

<p>（乙）煤斤問題，劉·黃·施·三委員曾於報吿中建議人點，如運輪及修復鐵路等等，決議交由交通主管部門研商，其次對滬地有墨煤之出現，則決議交由經濟部會同滬市府嚴格取締。至於煤價爲維持煤礦生產，經濟部提義，應提高價格百分之四十，會中予以通過。</p>
<p>（丙）劉·黃·施·三委員並在報吿中，對糧食問題提出多項難議，會中決議交糧食部研究。</p>
<p>（丁）金融外匯數項建議，則分別交由財政平衡基金委員會酌量辦理。比外對於物價主張意見，則由經濟委員會秘書處先行整理，提下次會討論。</p>

<p>中央銀行稽核處查核本市票據交換所之退票數字，近突激增，最高曾達十萬張以上，較過去幾增加十二倍之多。究其原因，全因當日票據當日仍可繼續抵用，以至信用膨脹，增加退票。此外並又查出行莊之存戶，朱與行莊訂立合約，即擅自透支。設遇行莊頭寸週轉失靈，該項邊支票據即成退票。近日且又發現存款充足之存戶，開出之票據，亦遭退票。根據銀行法，有存款者而銀行予以退票，此銀行應負責賠償，茲則僅由行方在次日道歉了事。諸如此類之情事，均足以增加信用通貨，擾亂市塲，故中央銀行對當日票據不能抵用事，決作進一步之嚴格管制。行莊對客戶之本票，無論如何不得退票，若退票即以有倒閉之嫌疑處理。當日支票不抵用後，退票可望减少至零云。</p>
<p>同業定期存款國行提高利率並將單位改爲一億元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲鼓勵商業行莊吸收社會游資起見，曾規定同業定期存款一種，以五億元爲一單位，十日爲期，月息五分。辦理以來，聞商業行莊存儲甚多。惟最近因市塲利息增高，銀錢兩業公會要求提高存息。並以五億元之定額，對一般存款較少之行莊，仍感不便。茲悉：國行已自十月二十五日起，將此項存欲單位，改爲一億兀，並將月息提高至八分計算云。當局計劃整理</p>
<p>當局計劃整理東北流通劵台幣仍暫維現狀</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕聯合徵信所訊，據可靠方面獲悉，對於東北現行流通券，當局計劃於一適當時機，予以整理，改爲國幣。但台幣之整理，刻尙有待，因台省物價平穩，該地產品豐富，以省區經濟而言，無論對內地或國外，其貿易皆屬出超地位，故當局殊不願遽而予以更變，以影響該省現有之良好經濟狀况。</p>
<h3>統債外股均疲</h3>
<p>統一公債暗市俱見微挫，大戶仍有抬高出籠之勢，價乃高後猛退。統丙自二三七〇〇元升至二四五○〇元，不久即退至二〇九○○元，午收回至二一四〇○元。較上日降一千六百元，甲乙降一千二百元，丁種小一千三百元，戊種跌九〇〇元。成交共六七百萬元云。</p>
<p>外股市况均見回小，洋行帮雖進，證券帮則出。會德　跌勢尤勁，怡妙一九七〇〇〇元降至一九〇〇〇〇元，午收回至一九五〇〇〇元，較前收跌七千元。英聯降九千元，蒙廣降五千元，航業紙版公司怡啤微挫，會德　跌半成以上，電話進出在一一五〇〇〇元至一二〇〇〇〇元，　植三五〇〇〇元至三八〇〇〇元云</p>

<h3>新買望不前華股交易冷落</h3>
<p>華股第五十二期遞交昨日登塲借款消息，影響人心，散戶時以脫售現期爲得計。新遞交因少新買，疲象時顯。息價步低，雖有廣帮銀行吸現，終難挽頹勢，前市竟以低價收市，市况頗淸。但套利父易，則尙可觀。午後因十底頭襯，已於午前軋妥，現遞交接，亦在前市吿一段落，人心略奮，各價多挺。中途又聞出差一百數十億元，益啓買與，復聞全經會在目都召集會議，一般均寄以樂歡，故臨收咸在高價收市。上落殊稀，脚地尙穩。，</p>
<h3>]經紀人要求酌減證據金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市證卷交易所，昨日下午四時，召開理監事聯席會議，對於經紀人公會要求將遞交證據金酌予减低一案，討論一過，咸認爲經紀人所述，確屬實情，決轉呈財經兩部核示云。</p>
<h3>米市實銷平淡油價升沉互見</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬二千五百餘石，早市一度喚緊，終以實銷平淡，收市仍見軟化，結局粳秈米均成高挺次呆，白元陰元平平。麵粉早市猛跌，午市因無錫　市　高，轉　三四千元。　皮站定。</p>
<p>豆餅供求兩稀，黃豆早市疲落，後因本街收購，油廠問津，結果較前軋低萬元。　豆南洋仍選高料，赤豆廣帮搜羅甚力，新赤豆來貨雖旺，仍漲五六萬元。豇豆汕銷見懈，挫跌一二萬元。紅糧酒坊去化熱鬧，挺升萬元，苞米北帮略動，提高殺次，芝蔴本街消路香燥，回升一二萬元，油廠亦進市勢轉挺，生仁明定暗堅。</p>
<p>油市升沉互見，豆油去化活潑，回升一二萬元，生油呆滯，江北生油　有到申，挫落三五萬元，淸油蔴油菜油均少呼吸。</p>
<p>自備外匯進口物資　申請退貨者已有　餘起</p>
<p>自備外匯到埠貨物之申請，及補行登記事宜，輸管會自上週發出通知後，各進口商已有前往辦理手續者，迄至目前爲止，申請轉遝出口退貨者，已有三十餘件。大多數進口商，仍正待政府收購與出售辦法之公布。故申請收購者，尙在觀望中。又申請退澴原貨之行商，輸管會尙未轉知海關放行。該會所接獲退貨之申請案件，正整理中，整理竣事，即通知海關放行。</p>
<h3>華南放寬限額輸管無此决定</h3>
<p>又訊，報　華南輸入限額，即將放寬，自備外匯亦可准許進口之消息，據輸管會秘書處方鵷先處長談，此事毫無所聞。本會現無此種決定，華南方面，亦未有任何報吿，想係一般人之主張與希望。又據限額分配處沈奏廷處長稱，華南限額之放寬，與准許自備外匯之輸入，均應由會統一規定。華南限額如應放寬，即由全季限額內增加其數字，張總裁前次赴惠時，已將華南限額增加一倍，今後　應如何，本會迄無決定。至自備外，尙待政院之核示。沈氏對於第四季限額放寬一事之表示，係以外　之收入轉移，如外匯增多，放寬限額不成問題。目前限業均紛繪請求增加。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>昨日票據交換四行二局差出一七六億元，暗息二角，證券貼息仍一角九分半至二角四分。</p>
<p>食油全面配給，原定下月一日起開始辦理，該批食油係中信局，中植廠，三煉油業公會合撥，總計三萬六千担。按照配價售與上海市民食調配委員會配售，茲因其間交貨時　款資金，　未解決，故尙難如期配售。</p>

<h3>婦嬰與破傷風</h3>
<p>— 楊元吉</p>
<p>婦嬰與疾病之間的關係，比較一般人容易密切，對破傷風並不能例外，所以「惟女十與小人爲難養也」這句話，也可作這樣的解釋，破傷風究克是一種怎麼樣的病狀？要研究它所以能有如此可怕的現象，先要知道破傷風不平凡的個性與生活力。</p>
<p>是一個2-3Nicron左右長的桿菌，具有數十根鞭毛，能活　運動。任何塲合中都能生活，祇要杜絕養氣之外，在溫度攝氏三十五度左右的時候，是它最幸福的時候。</p>
<p>且于有頑强的抵抗力，最執一的蒸氣如果不超過五分鐘以上，80度以上的高熱如果不到一小時以上，都不足以使它展眼；它能在不利的石炭峻中堅持十五分鐘，1％的昇汞溶液中苦鬥三小時，直逼的陽光，它亦能抵抗相當長的時閱。</p>
<p>因此，它很高　，你相信嗎？它在地中能生存三年牛，寄身在馬身的濃汁中，能世代延議十六個月；而移殖於乾木片上的，那麼它們的歷史已有數年。</p>
<p>造成這頑強個性的要素是它先天遺有的毒性。這劇烈的毒性才使它顯示不凡，使它成爲人類的大敵。它利用這產生在體外的武器分成兩稱方式進攻：一稱與神經中樞細胞結合，使人發生痙攣（呌破傷風　毒Tetanospasmin）；一種溶解紅血球，使人發生中毒現象（呌破傷風溶血毒Tetanolysin），所以它的毒素在菌毒中占最高寳座：祇要以毒素的○·○○○○二公分可以毒斃十公分體車的白鼠；動物中尤以馬類對它的感受性最大，幾似遇到煞神。</p>
<p>不過，要是人類的各組織健全而無創傷的話，那麼破傷風菌塗在皮膚上，亦不能逞其威燄；毫無發揮毒素機會。</p>
<p>那麼，它的與人發生關係，一定要備有下列數條件了：</p>
<p>皮膚或粘膜有創傷。</p>
<p>創傷之口，除破傷風菌外，同時有異物（木片等）或其他雜菌等混入。</p>
<p>受創傷的地點環境，應汚穢而空氣不暢和常有人畜往來的所在。</p>
<p>對於它選入的路徑，可有二種見地：</p>
<p>一種以為它是由淋巴道侵入的。從局部的神經周團淋巴隙，作求心性的漸進，達於運動性中樞神經細胞，而互相結合。</p>
<p>一種以爲毒素是由侵入部的血管淋巴系，到達神經末梢後，再沿軸索而至中樞，與腦脊髓的運動神經細胞互相結合。</p>
<p>現在讓我們來描述一下破傷風使人類發生可怕的　面罷：</p>
<p>你們可曾見到一種非獰笑，非苦笑的悽厲容貌嗎？這就是特殊的破傷風貌Facies　Tetanica。它所獨具的笑容呌做痙笑Riseis　Sardonicus。我再詳細地分晣一下，你們就不難想像：這面貌的發生開始是咀嚼肌的强直—咀嚼運動發生陴得，牙關緊閉Trismus，不能進食。其次顏面肌緊張强直，於是前額生皺紋，口縫向外斜，牙齒畢露，唇講上下凹Nasolabiafalte。再其次項部肌肉强直，背部肌肉緊張，腹肌緊張，形成背　如弓，腹硬如板。肋間肌也緊張時，胸廊就固定在吸氣狀態中，而全部呼吸運動，全靠橫膈膜而已。</p>
<p>最痛苦的就是病人並未失去意識，很淸明，因爲反射機能的亢進，往往極輕微的刺激，如少許的光綫響音等接觸，就能誘起痙攣再發，而咳嗽嚥下更不必談了。病人因痛極而號呌，眼淚汪汪，苦惱之狀，慘不忍睹。至臨死前後的熱度可超過四十三度以上，所謂過高熱Hyperpyrexio，大概因爲調節中樞麻痺的緣故</p>
<p>病人的死有閃電式的三四日而亡，有麻痺式的一二星期死亡；若能經過五六星期的，多數是减輕而有生望的了。潛伏期愈短的結果愈不良。</p>
<p>由此觀來，破傷風菌之所以容易與婦嬰接觸，是顯而易見的事實。因爲：</p>
<p>嬰兒初生下來的時候，必須斷臍，斷臍之處，必成創傷；如果斷濟之器不潔，紮　之帶汚穢不消毒，那麼撮口噤的引起，就是七日風，所謂七日風。即醫學上所稱之初生兒破傷風TatanusTraumatiano。</p>
<p>產婦分娩，生殖器部或多或少要受創傷，全靠助產時之消毒嚴密，褥期中的處理淸潔，才可免細菌傳染；否則，不潔之禍，遺害無窮乘隙而入者，豈僅破傷風菌而已。</p>
<p>所以，爲了要防止細菌傳染，更爲了要阻止破傷風之輕易剝奪生命；產婦的絕對施以消毒處置，嬰兒的絕對注意消毒斷臍，是不容絲毫疏忽的鐵規，犯了規就無疑的間接鑄下了疏忽殺人的大錯。</p>
<p>雖然，破傷風亦有血淸療法，但遠不如白喉血淸的來得神奇有速效，因爲破傷風毒素與神經細菌結合後，比白喉毒素之結合於組織細胞者更爲迅速而牢固，並且治療上之注射血淸，迨至痙攣發作後多數已屬無效。注射愈早愈妙。注射的容量，大約皮下及靜脈用量應大，抗毒素可至四五萬單位；脊髓內蜘珠膜囊內，用量可小，約二三百單位，已能見大效。當然，治療法中之傷口淸潔，消毒，收歉，以及硫酸鎂（20％）劑之注射，均爲對症療法，亦是必須做到的有效處置</p>
<p>破傷風血淸之成績雖不能如白喉之顯著，但其已能將百分之八九十的死亡率减低到百分之四五十，功效亦不可謂不良了。</p>
<p>若回顧古舊醫學上記載，也有許多證據；可供參考：</p>
<p>如「隋代巢民諸病源候總論」中之「產後中風痙候」有六：「其狀口急噤，背强直，搖頭馬鳴，腰爲反折，須臾十發，氣急如絕，汗出如雨，不拭不及者皆死」。</p>
<p>又如其描述小兒攝口噤云：</p>
<p>「一日撮口，二日着噤，三日　風，皆是急病；但看面赤喘急，啼泣聲不出者，候已急危」</p>
<p>則可知破傷風一症，遠在千百年前，早就被視為束手無策之嚴重絕症了。</p>
<h3>哺乳兒營養障礙（續）</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>消化不良症營養療法</p>
<p>營養療法之必要者，觀夫祗行食餌之變換得令治療之事即可明療。</p>
<p>人乳營養療法：普通凡哺乳兒之年齡愈幼行人乳營養愈爲必要。但即使在年長兒乳哺，亦以人乳爲最優之營養療法。給與人乳之際，無須一定其分量，祗須制限授乳之時間與問數已足。</p>
<p>開始人乳營養後，並不立見體重之增加，却於起初二日至四日間，體重减少，然後諸症輕快，外貌良好，於是體重增加。</p>
<p>人工營養療法：先於最初六時至二十四時間，行饑餓療法</p>
<p>餓療法</p>
<p>未必爲絕對的　餓之謂，如加有少量之甘味晶（約○·○五％）之番茶煎汁等無害者，一日二○至三○立糎，每二小時與之。行本法之結果，患兒安靜，睡眠佳良，泄瀉之回數遂减少。但本療法，對於甚消耗者或幼稚年齡僅二三星期者，甚屬危險，因此致耐力减退終至難於恢復，故以不行為宜。</p>
<p>從療法第二日起，以脫脂乳中或牛酪乳之不加糖者，或以添加燕麥粒　汁之　乳（在成長之乳兒用　乳）與之。其量，在第二日一日全量不可超二○○立糎，最大限每回四○立糎，一日五回。此外併用附加甘味之番茶以充水分之要求。而以後顧慮全身狀態及便之性質而定用量，以漸次增量爲方針。例如：療法第二日　乳每回　立糎</p>
<p>一日五回療法第三日　乳每回五○立糎同療法第四日　乳每回六○立糎同</p>
<p>如是可漸次增量，移行於相當於年齡之食餌濃度及量，又若初使用脫脂乳時，亦可顧慮症狀而逐漸移行至全乳，例如初用全乳與脫脂乳等量混合之脂肪較少之乳汁，繼乃將脫脂乳减半是也</p>
<p>體重之增加，乃基因於炭水化物者，故以之添加於乳汁中之際，不可不加以注意。（完）</p>
<h3>用麻醉劑割治頸部　病症發生意外之實例</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>本年內在京滬各地曾經發生因用麻醉劑而致死亡之病例二起。其中除上海南洋醫院郭至德醫師用局部麻醉法割治柯維耀臀部疣症一案已被法院判決無罪外，而南京市立醫院錢明熙醫師用脊　麻醉法為刁榮泰割治盲腸炎一案則被法院判決過失殺人處以徒刑一年半。錢案與郭案原極相似，若以科學家眼光論斷，則錢案當可無罪。然而處茲亂世，中國之科學家原不値錢，更何論懸　問世之廢師哉。惟有憑各人之運命而已。今者錢案已經上訴，其結果如何，予不之知。予近閱本年八月十六日發刋之瑞士醫學過報第七十七卷三十三期所　之用麻醉齊發生意外事件一具，與錢案亦極相似。倘得法官採納所述材料而加以平反則豈特錢明熙　師一人之幸抑亦我全國西醫界</p>
<p>（附註：此車發生於一九四六年八月間，主治醫師爲瑞士國京城（Bern）大學醫院耳鼻喉科主任兼大學敎授雷蒂博士（Prof.L.Ruedi）。病者息後咽部蜂窠織炎症，用靜脈注射之全身麻醉劑（Narconumal）於注射後即有呼吸停止狀態，雖經各種救急方法將其救活並爲之割治原有病症，而病者始終昏迷不醒，旋於翌日死亡。死者之屍體立即解剖，檢查其致死原因。叙述此事之經過情形者為葛拉芙博士（Dr.K.　Graf）。彼曾詳述用全身麻醉法或局部麻醉法割治頸部或咽喉部位病症之各種利弊，以及各國外科專家對於此種麻醉方法割治上述病症之種種意見（有反對者，亦有贊成者）葛博士又詳述靜脈注射之全身麻醉劑如Narconumal者之各種優點以及副作用非常少見之情形。因文長不具錄，茲僅摘譯病症割治經過及屍體解剖情形以及檢查結果之報吿而已）。</p>
<p>病者爲廿七歲之商人。四天前忽覺吞嚥食物時喉部兩側有疼痛及困難下　情形。旋即發覺在左側近甲狀腺處有劇痛，吞嚥時更爲痛楚。三天以後熱度在攝氏表三十人度與卅九度之間。醫師疑爲患後咽部膿瘍症遂勸其住在上述醫院內診洽。其一九四六年八月七日之檢查報吿如下：「病者患病甚爲沉重，頻呼吞嚥時有劇烈痛楚。熱度卅八度四。頸部腫大。左側頸部紅腫特甚。以手按其左側頸部即有劇痛。似有硬性而顯明之腫漲，其腫漲之部位極其明顯而易於區分。其甲狀腺所成之硬塊撫之則有劇痛，又其頸部大靜脈左右亦有劇痛且兼腫漲，惟以手指按之則無凹陷現象。其頸部右側亦有上述之類似情形，惟無如此之甚而已。此時病者之牙關並不僵硬。舌部無病態。扁桃腺作中等之大小，並無發炎現象。咽喉後部無變化，惟咽喉兩側之帶狀物微有腫大。氣管門正常無病。其臨床診斷爲甲狀腺炎，血毒性扁桃腺炎及後咽部蜂窠織炎三者之間，似難決定。其治療方法爲Elcosin　6gm'　Penicillin及生理食鹽水注射五百西西。</p>
<p>同月八日病勢如前。紅血球沉降速度爲三十七至六十六。白血球數九千六百白血球分類爲血毒性左傾。熱度卅九度六。因恐其頭部大靜脈內入毒發生血栓作用，遂由雷蒂敎授用局部麻醉法將其頸部大靜脈施行結紥術。結果於施用手術時證實其已有血栓現象。惟自大靜脈結紥後不惟毫未减輕，且有毒菌入血之勢。此時熱度在卅八度與卅九度之間。同年八月十日再度檢查，其時症象依舊，惟頭部則更腫大，自軟顎以至於氣管門皆已腫漲。又其咽喉後部以及兩側帶形隆起處亦已腫漲，捫之似如絲羢。雖則氣管門依然正常而其兩側則已腫漲且已變狹。（未完）</p>

<h3>寫在黃君璧敎授畫展之前</h3>
<p>— 張道藩</p>
<p>廿四年冬由梁寒操兄之介紹，得識畫家黃君豐先生於南京，縱談藝事，相見甚歡，論空於今已十餘載矣。深知君璧先生性耽藝術，幼承慈訓，努力繪事；旣長師事盡家李耀屏先生，以天資卓越，有出藍之譽。旣壯，以提倡美術爲職志，組國畫研究會於廣州，嶺南畫風之盛，君璧先生之力爲多。戰前歷任專科學校畫課；曾一度啣政府之命，東渡考察美術，識見愈廣。所爲畫，舉凡人物花鳥，莫不精妙；尤以山水出入百家，谿徑別出。蒼松古勁，飛瀑急流，雲烟出沒，氣韻生動；識者稱爲黃家山水三絕。君　先生之於畫，寢饋於斯數十年。家藏甚富，工力最深，不獨遠窺古人堂　，更能師法自然，獨出新意。國內名勝舉儿五嶽，黃山，雁岩，峨眉，劍門，靑城，三峽，登臨殆遍。故某作品能以前人筆墨，寫大自然之題材，有此成就，由來有自也。君蠻先生於戰時客蜀，執敎於中央大學藝術系，學者靡然風從。會寫作嘉陵百景，媲美前人，藝壇讚善。巾外鑒藏家得其寸縑尺楮，珍逾拱璧。其盡風之獨特，久已名重當世，無待贅言。茲以敎學之餘，寫作所得，應滬上友人之邀，於十月卅一日起至十一月五日止，展覽於成都路中國畫苑。覽者見其精心之作如此之多，常可證吾言之不謬，而非阿其所好者矣！</p>
<h3>夜行</h3>
<p>— 秦嶺</p>
<p>上弦月淡幽　地照着小巷，風輕　飛快地沿着溪岸溜，一陣緊跟着一陣，傍水人家短牆上　簇　成堆的綠　，綠得朦朧，綠得蒼白，悠然下乘的枝條被風一吹磨擦着牆壁，刷刷索索地　。</p>
<p>足聲拖成者影子；我獨自夜行於河邊，帶幾分溫暖而凄涼的感覺。這地方在我是太熟悉了，自童年到成年，每天每天，陽光下，風雪裏，我挾着書包經過這兒，毫無問斷，毫無停頓。我說得出每埰牆的主人，每座牆所閣着的園子裏有點什麼成熟的果子，我也淸晰地記得河邊小樹的位置，河流終日多情地吟哦它的詩篇，輕風打着口哨，這樣一年年過去，歲月在我身上留下了足跡，我把它們轉交給小巷。</p>
<p>爲了生活，我離開家鄉已好多年，今夜，舊地重臨，一垜牆，一棵樹，都已轉換了面目，原有的牆倒塌了，新的牆接着砌起來。也換過了新的主人，疏落落的小樹都長成濃密蒼勁的樣子，脫洛了枝葉的古樹，像衰年的老人在夜風裏嘆息，一切都變了，縱然如此，這裏的每粒石子，每綠片葉，對我仍有着親切之感，我們是共同生活過來的！數年來，離開小巷，離開了家，闖入陌生疏遠的環境裏，飽經孤單與風霜，但回到小巷的今日之我，怕與我　小巷一般，只落得一聲「憔悴了，你！」</p>
<p>縛過小巷，便是孔廟的大道，路上已沒個行人，學宮的紅牆在月光下透着慘淡，高　的古樹間傳下一聲聲鳥唳，沿河一帶的石欄，投下了斜斜的黑影，拱橋靜悄悄地酣眠於流水之上，往年曾細細數着上面各字的牌坊，上座座兀立在陰暗處，這裏有上層濃重的凄涼，但對我近日來心情的煩煉，却成爲極好的調和。</p>
<p>再過去，成片的草塲展開了，玉蜀黍，向日葵，密密地擠在一起，秋虫，蛀聲，此起彼落地響，風從葉片上捲過去，自草塲的這　傳到那頭，這情景呌我懷念起許多童時的遊伴，那時，我們大夥兒捉蚱蜢，摘新鮮的玉米，拉下　　當呌子吹，　在鳳尾草問捉　火虫，脫去鞋子跑下了搗衣石，把雙足浸在水裏……可是，那些童伴，現在死的死了，活着的彼此也是音訊疏隔，憑一些傳來的消息，僅僅知道誰的境況比起來更壞而已，這年頭，情感，希望，五色繽紛的遐想都被榨得粉碎了，爲了不能不活，為了不能不裝點笑容，我們是如此疲乏而艱辛地挨下來，往事是一個夢，綺麗而獷野，精緻而活泛，但一切都已不可追取了。</p>
<p>遠處一陣陣　柝聲，時間已近中夜，天邊有着輕雷，　略顯得粗暴的風，冲淡了月色，突然，我的步伐遲緩了，覺得有着無限的疲倦與憂傷，似乎有人低低在我耳畔說：</p>
<p>「現在，活着已是一種奢侈了」。</p>
<h3>葡萄</h3>
<p>— 西園</p>
<p>——聽秋樓走筆</p>
<p>隨着時序的推移，秋光將老，瓜類早已成過去，各種鮮果又應時而來。</p>
<p>在各種鮮果中我覺得葡萄較其它更可愛，　夢陽的葡萄詩云：『萬里西風過雁時，碧雲玄玉影參差，泗酣試取冰丸嚼，不說天南有荔枝』。其實不一定在酒後，無論什麼時候，拿起一串葡萄，把它一粒一粒送進嘴裏，那種淸甜適口的滋味，　使人心情歡舞。</p>
<p>我們若探討葡萄的來源，也是與西瓜一樣。是由西域輸入，漢書大宛國傳載：『大宛左右，以葡萄爲酒，富人藏酒至萬餘石，久者至數十歲不敗。漢使採葡萄苜蓿歸種，天子以天馬多，又外國使來衆，參種葡萄　宮館旁，極盛焉。』李頎詩云：『年年戰骨埋荒外，空見葡萄入漢家。』可是現在的人只知道享用，誰又知道這區區葡萄的來源呢！</p>
<p>葡萄的種類很多，　芳講記載很詳；水晶葡萄，　色帶白如粉，形大而長，味甚甘，西蕃者尤佳。爲乳葡萄，色紫，形大而長，味甘，紫葡萄，黑色，有大小兩種，酸甜兩味，綠葡萄，出蜀中，熟時色綠若西蕃之　葡萄，名曰　睛，味勝糖蜜，無核，則吳品也。」</p>
<p>與葡萄有運帶　係的，則爲葡萄酒，蘇子出詩云：「葡萄不禁冬，屈盤似無氣，春來乘盛陽，覆架靑綏被，龍　亂無數，馬乳垂至地，初如早梅　，晚作濃酪味，誰能　爲酒。為爾架前醉。』劉禹錫詩云：『之成美酒，令人飲不足，爲君持一斗，往取凉州收。』王翰的凉州詞：更是人人盡知的詩句。</p>
<p>我國　揚葡萄的文字很多，魏文帝詔中有一段說到葡萄，他說：『中國珍果很多，且說葡萄，當其末夏涉秋，尙有餘署，酒醉宿醒，　露而食，甘而不飴，脆而不酸，冷而不寒，味長多汁，除煩解渴，又　以爲酒，甘於麵　，固已流涎咽唾，况親食之耶？他方之果，寗有匹者。』這更可見曹丕的特別賞識葡萄，却可稱葡萄知己了。</p>
<p>「那一類的消息，吳先生？」　　搶在我前頭開口了；她說着，一面又指揮小老虎給　元斟茶。</p>
<p>「還不就是鬼子進攻南口的事！」　元把脫下的衣服和零件，攬成一國，往屋角草堆上一扔：「他們本來定規明天拂曉攻擊；不曉得怎麼一來，現在聽說改在午夜偷　—今晚十二點，就要動手了。這麼一改，別的倒沒有什麼，可是……」</p>
<p>「可是！……」耀羣同時　口說了這兩個字，立刻又頓住了，意思要讓鼎元說下去。但是鼎元因見耀羣接了口，便梯他梯他，慢吞吞地往　角那個草堆走去，一面用手撐在草堆上，抖抖素索地坐了下去，接過了小老虎給他斟上的一杯茶，一面很抱歉似的，向　　點了一個頭，意思是讓耀羣發表他的意見。鼎元的英國式紳士態度，大概只保留下了這一些些。</p>
<p>「可是……跟我們預定的那個計劃，似乎有些衝突，不是嗎？」耀羣　　鼎元，把她所要說的那句話說了出來。</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？我也是這麼想着。」鼎元表示了他剛才預備發表的那個意見。</p>
<p>我們這幾個人聽了耀羣和鼎元這句對白，都似乎不明白其中的意旨似的；大傻子「○四」僅僅睜着一雙大眼睛，表示英明其妙；小老虎也驚眼　張地。瞧瞧　　又瞧瞧鼎元。至於我，當然更是莫明其妙了。</p>
<p>唔，對不起，岳先生！」耀　瞧備我很抱歉的一笑：「剛才因爲提到過去的事，嚕嚕　　的說了這麼多，把今天晚上要辦的大事，竟忘了吿訴您。我們來來打算今天晚上，最遲明天早上，一起離開昌平。動身之前，我們預務術對這裏的日本特務大本營，給他一們厲害的，至少也要　得他四分五裂……」</p>
<p>「噢？」我猛然一聽耀羣的這個計劃，感着有些　奇。</p>
<p>「是，」耀羣很決斷的對我點了點頭：「我們的步驟是這樣的；先由我和虎弟，跑到鬼子的最前綫，左翼，發出警號。守衞南口的咱們國軍，事前已經跟我們通過了消息，他們一得到這　號，立刻就着手夜　；整個前綫，一起發動。雖不一定要衝到日本鬼子的　綫裏來，可也準備着給鬼子們一個重大的打擊！……」</p>
<p>「警　？……夜襲？……」我並沒有意思要打斷　　的話，只於是重複耀　口邊這幾僩　人的字眼。</p>
<h3>那赤心的女僕</h3>
<p>— 波德萊爾作　戴望舒譯</p>
<p>那赤心的女僕，當年你妬忌她，現在她睡眠在卑微的草地下，我們也應該帶幾朶花去供奉。死者，可憐的死者，都有大苦痛；當十月這老樹的伐枝人　吹牠的悲風，　繞着他們的　碑，他們一定覺得活人眞沒良心，那麼安睡着，暖暖地擁着棉衾，他們却被暗黑的夢想所前熬，旣沒有共枕人，也沒有開說笑，老骨頭冰凍，給蟲豸蛀到骨髓，他們感覺冬天的雪在滲乾水，感覺世紀在消逝，又無友無家去換掛在他們　　上的殘花。假如爐薪嘯歌的時候，在晚問，我看見她坐到圈椅上，很安閑，假如在十二月的靑色的寒宵，我發現她綣縮在房間的一角，神情嚴　，從她永恒的床出來，用慈眼賞看着她長大的小孩；看見她四陷的眼睛墜淚滾滾，我怎樣來回答這虔誠的靈魂？</p>
<h3>民族藝術之新生</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>—讀黃君壁敎授國畫</p>
<p>一代文藝學術之成就，乃千百年歷史文化之累積。有千百年悠久博厚之文化淵源，而後乃有一代光輝　　之女藝　術。中　云：『至　無息，不息則久，久則微，微則悠遠，悠遠則博厚，博厚則高明』。若以此語說明我民族文化之綿延不絕及其發揚光大之現象，實極精確。蓋至誠乃我民族精神之至寳，亦爲致力一般文藝學術者之基本條件。而其成就尤不能脫離民族淵源與文化傳統，更為不易之理。</p>
<p>中央大學敎授黃君璧先生，幼承家學，夙從名師，歷覽名畫，力學不倦；如宋之　巨，元之四家，明之沈文唐仇，淸之二石，新　南田，研討迨遍。戰前曾東渡考察美術，回國後更漫游國內名勝，如羅浮陽朔，黃山雁蕩，每一發臨，輒流連寫生。戰時溯江西上，三登峨嵋，兩出劍閣，所寫嘉陵百景，不獨直迫前人，更能別出谿徑，自成一家。</p>
<p>嘗聞君　先生論雙，主張初學須辨別盡派源流，而後直溯唐宋；學有所成，則應師法自然，獨自創迭。所謂脫胎古人以造化爲師者，斯近之矣。</p>
<p>君　先生托敎中大已將十年，學者風從，藝林推重，最近携　來滬展覽，承示所作「　　　翠」，「　門帆影」，「　岩觀　」，「竹林消夏」及「高坑岩飛瀑」「携琴覓賞　」諸幀，筆　蒼莽，設色沉學，章法新穎而　　，多在宋元人之間；而雲烟水光，蒼潤欲流，一草一木，生機洋溢，尤能深得寫生三昧。是乃淺淫於民族文化傳統，而更能以至誠精神獨立創迭者也。</p>
<p>羣之餘，旣佩君　先生之　　，因更感於我中華民族藝術之新生；深信新生之淵源，實不能脫離文化傳統之繼承，更有賴於創迭精神之發揚焉。用略抒所感，以就質於高明。</p>

<h3>讀者信箱　離婚·出走·厭世</h3>
<p>單女士鑒：接續來信，我們對於您的身世，非常同情。您提出的三點，現在簡單的答復如下：　「離婚」法律上離婚的方式有二：，一爲「兩願離婚」，即夫妻兩方均願　婚時，就得自行離婚；不過未成年的人，要得到法定代理人的同意方可。離婚的手續也很簡單，寫了離婚書，有二人以上的蹬人簽名便可；能由律師來簽證，自更妥當了。如果已有子女的話，那末關於子女的　護，依法是由夫擔任；不過另有約定的，也可從其約定。您說：「我是一儸二十歲的女子」，法律上所稱之「成年」，是要滿足二十歲的。一般習慣所稱的歲數，往往是虛年齡，這一點您要注意到。另一種的離婚方式，是「判決離婚」，那就是夫妻之一方，向法院請求離婚；但必須具備法定的理由，如「夫妻之一方受他方不堪同居之慮待」，或者是「夫要之一方以惡意遺棄他方在繼續狀能中」等等。（詳見民法第一千○五十二條）夫妻之一方，因判決離婚而受有損害的，得向有過失的他方請求賠償。照您來信所說，只不過是「沒有情感」和「瞧他不起」罷了，似乎沒有法定理由可資依據，不過時日愈長，彼此的隔膜也就愈深。我們以爲人與人之間，情感是可以培養起來的，何况是夫妻！　「出走」出走不是光明正大的辦法，在沒有離婚以前，去和別人結婚，或者同居，那就觸犯了刑法。（詳見刑法第二百卅七條和二百卅九條）　「厭世」自殺是最懦弱最愚笨的行爲，毀滅了自已，不但解決不了問題，而且得不到肚會的同情，這又何苦來呢？所以，厭世之念，是萬萬要不得的！你以爲怎樣？（編者）</p>

<h3>Joint Land and Air Defense of Jilin and Changchun; Recovery of Changtu County in Northern Liaoning; Two National Army Routes in Western Liaoning Join Forces in Yixian</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] Amidst the biting cold, Jilin and Changchun stand firm. The valiant land and air forces of the National Army in the Northeast are determined to defend these two key cities, exerting unparalleled strength. The communist bandits, facing this fortress of steel, can only yearn from afar and are now using their last manpower.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 30th] The battle situation in Jilin has suddenly become tense in recent days. Since yesterday, it can be said that the National Army has entered a difficult stage, but with the cooperation of land and air forces, the bandits will ultimately not succeed. Xiaobaishan was once briefly occupied by bandits yesterday. The bandits in the northwest suburbs of Changchun, after repeated attacks by the National Army yesterday and today, show signs of collapse. The suburbs were peaceful last night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] The opportunity to encircle and annihilate the invading bandits outside Changchun is gradually maturing. The Fourth Independent Division of the bandits in West Manchuria may play the leading role as the target of the National Army's encirclement and annihilation. Over the past 24 hours, the bandits' movements do not seem to have moved beyond the reorganization stage. There has been no fierce fighting in the northwest corners. The advance troops of the bandits have been discovered in Zhao Jiaying and Mao Jiawopeng, 15 li northwest of Xiaonan Station in the northern suburbs of Changchun. Military officials here say that, given the current troop strength in Changchun, the bandits' attempt to invade Changchun is truly the most ridiculous dream.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th] The National Army in Yongji has achieved brilliant results. The 29th Division (formerly the Third Independent Division) of the bandit's Tenth Column launched another fierce attack on the National Army positions outside Yongji on the evening of the 28th. The defending troops immediately rose up to meet the attack, fighting fiercely all night. By dawn on the 29th, the bandits' momentum had been frustrated, and they gradually retreated. Just as our air force arrived, it unleashed its power in the skies above the battlefield, repeatedly bombing and strafing the ground troops of the bandits. The defending troops also seized the opportunity to attack. The bandits suffered nearly total casualties, and high-ranking cadres below the bandit division commander were killed. The bandits' 26th Column and 1st and 2nd Independent Divisions, who had infiltrated Jilin South's Xiaobaishan and Tuanshanzi areas, also suffered heavy casualties and are now fleeing in the southeast and northwest directions of Yongji.</p>
<p>[United Press, Changchun, 30th] The military position of Changchun is far more solid than people in Beijing and Shanghai had expected. The New First Army, trained by the United States and China, and the local "Security Forces" are holding the city. Contrary to rumors, the New First Army still has ample ammunition for its American weapons. In addition to existing stockpiles, the Shenyang Arsenal is also able to manufacture American military supplies, so there is no fear of shortages.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] The bridgehead on the north bank of the Songhua River, 240 li north of Changchun, which is isolated, is still firmly held by the National Army. The defending troops have ample food and ammunition, and the communist bandits have not dared to face it head-on.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] Liao Yaoxiang went to the Tie嶺 (Tieling) and 開原 (Kaiyuan) area again on the 30th to command the National Army in Tieling and Kaiyuan, which were divided into multiple routes to attack, creating a great momentum. They first captured Changtu Railway Station and then Changtu County (more than ten kilometers northwest of the railway station) on the afternoon of the 29th. Communist bandits between Changtu and Siping fled in panic upon hearing the news. There are now no traces of bandits between Tieling and Siping. The National Army in western Liaoning, which rushed from Jinzhou to support Yixian, joined forces in Yixian on the 29th. The repair team for the Jinzhou-Gubei Line crossed Xuejia Station and reached Shangqitai. On the 28th, the National Army in western Liaoning wiped out the remaining bandits in the area of Laobian (ten kilometers northwest of Jinxi), encircling and annihilating more than half of the bandit Xingcheng branch.</p>
<h3>National Army in Western Henan Recovers Lingbao; Communist Bandits in Central Shandong Defeated in Yidu; Five Bandit Warehouses Seized South of Huangxian in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 30th] The National Army in western Henan, advancing eastward along the Longhai Railway, recovered Lingbao County on the evening of the 27th. In this battle, 3,000 people from the county, led by Li Zikui, annihilated many bandits. The National Army continued to advance eastward. The National Army east of Mianchi, in addition to severely attacking the remaining bandits entrenched there, also launched a surprise attack, capturing all the river crossings along the Mianchi River. The remnants of the communist bandits will be forced into the gorges between the Xiaoshan and Xiong'er mountains, where they will be encircled and annihilated, making it difficult for them to escape.</p>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 30th] Military news: On the 29th, the militia, in coordination with a part of the National Army, launched a fierce attack on the bandits entrenched in Shangshui. After a fierce battle, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled in panic. Shangshui was then recovered.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] A small group of remnants from Liu's Third Column is currently surrounded by the National Army, which has been dispatched from both Liu'an and Shucheng, in the southeastern area of Sunjiagang and will soon be completely annihilated. In addition, the remaining bandits in the Zhangjiadian area south of Liu'an are also being cleared and suppressed by the National Army in Liu'an.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 30th] Military news: The bandits who fled into Yingshan have collapsed and retreated towards Wujia Chong. Yingshan is still in our army's hands.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 30th] Chen's Third Column fled to the area between Luyi and Zhecheng on the 29th. The National Army is tracking and suppressing them.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 30th] In the campaign to search and suppress the remaining bandits in northern Anhui, Sixian has made the fastest progress. The militia of this county, in coordination with the National Army, is stationed in Shuanggou and is advancing towards Siji. The bandit army appears to be retreating and harassing the Hongze Lake area. A unit of Liu Bocheng's forces established a puppet Huoqiu County government in Yeji, with Zhu Guangqing as the puppet county magistrate, forcing the people to transport grain to the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 30th] The communist bandit's First, Fourth, and Seventh Regiments of the Shandong Central Police Force, along with more than 3,000 militiamen, launched a sudden and fierce siege of Yidu City starting at midnight on the 28th. After a counterattack by the National Army, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated to the northwestern mountainous area at around 8 a.m. on the 29th. In addition, when the National Army in Jiaodong swept through Sujiadian, 36 kilometers south of Huangxian, on the 28th, they discovered five bandit warehouses, fully stocked with ammunition and equipment. The number of hand grenades alone reached more than 20,000. Furthermore, when clearing the remaining bandits in Mount Tai, the National Army unearthed a hidden flat-trajectory gun, shells, and generators on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Hebei Bandits Spy on Shijiazhuang; Civil Aviation Route from Ping to Shijiazhuang Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Communist bandits continue to move towards the outskirts of Shijiazhuang. According to a telegram from Shijiazhuang, a unit of more than 3,000 bandits infiltrated Shizhuang, 30 li north of Yuanshi, on the 27th, cutting off communication between Yuanshi and Shizhuang. Another three brigades infiltrated Yaocheng, Pingshan, and Zhengding after the 25th. The Civil Aviation route from Ping to Shi (Shijiazhuang) has been suspended starting today due to circumstances. The southbound train on the Pingbao (Ping定 保定) line now only goes as far as Dingxing.</p>
<h3>Second District Commissioner's Office of Jiangsu Province; Convening a Suppression Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 30th] The Second District Commissioner's Office of Jiangsu Province has scheduled a suppression conference for the eight counties of Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, Kunshan, Changshu, Wu County, Suzhou, and Taicang to be held in Suzhou on November 3rd.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Captured Bandits Arrives in Hefei; Bandit Rifles Mostly of Russian Make</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch, 30th] A batch of communist bandit prisoners captured in Huoshan was escorted to Hefei by military vehicles this afternoon. Among them, six were wounded by bullets. The remaining approximately 100 prisoners were all healthy and strong, and most spoke with a Shandong and Hebei accent. The gray cotton military uniforms they wore were sewn from cloth and cotton looted when the bandits captured Liu'an last time. Staff Officer Liu of the command pointed out the characteristics of the captured weapons, such as rifles, to reporters. Many of the rifles were of Russian make, with a five-pointed star emblem engraved on the barrel. There were also many Japanese light machine guns.</p>
<h3>North Ning Railway Car Derails After Hitting a Mine</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] There were two accidents on the Beiping-Ningbo railway last night. A freight train hit a mine between Fengtai and Changli, causing six cars to derail. Two cars derailed after hitting a mine between Junliangcheng and Xinhe.</p>
<h3>National Army in Yulin Heroically Repels Bandits; Deng Baoshan Flies to Baotou for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Baotou Dispatch, 30th] The communist bandits besieging Yulin launched a fierce attack on the southeast of the city on the night of the 29th, but the Lingxiao Pagoda and other places outside the city were held by the defending troops, and the bandits could not succeed. Our reinforcements from the south are gradually advancing towards Yulin. On the afternoon of the 30th, the bandits again launched a fierce attack on the city walls. The defending troops inside the city heroically counterattacked, and planes also flew continuously to bomb them. Regiment Commander Gao Lingyun, who firmly defended the positions around the Lingxiao Pagoda, is the son of the late Army Commander Gao Shuangcheng. He is brave and has his father's style. He has killed many bandits outside the city in recent days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 29th] Deng Baoshan flew to Baotou by special plane on the morning of the 29th to command the entire war situation in northern Shaanxi. It is rumored that Deng may fly to Xi'an before deciding his future course of action.</p>
<h3>National Army in Western Rehe Launches Offensive; Three Routes Achieve Victory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 30th] On the night of the 29th, the National Army in western Rehe launched a surprise attack from Pingquan, 平泉, and Gubeikou, all achieving great victories. Battle reports were successively telegraphed here at dawn. It is estimated that more than 2,000 bandit troops from the Southern Rehe Military Sub-district were defeated near Pan City, 90 li south of Pingquan, with more than 300 captured and 200 rifles and 20 machine guns seized, along with a large amount of baggage. The bandits suffered more than half casualties and have collapsed. The bandit Lingyuan Detachment was defeated 30 li west of Lingyuan City. More than 4,000 bandits who had infiltrated Gubeikou, Diaoyu, and Halaichuan from Xinglong a few days ago were severely hit by the defending troops of Luanping and Gubeikou and were unable to retreat to their lair in Xinglong. They fled west into the mountains. The National Army in the three locations is still continuing its search and suppression efforts.</p>
<h3>Dong XianGuang Talks About Publication Law; Must be Reviewed and Passed by the Legislative Yuan; Then Promulgated and Implemented by the National Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Regarding the revised Publication Law passed by the Provisional Meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 24th of this month, Director Dong Xianguang of the News Bureau recently issued a written statement saying: "The draft of the revised Publication Law must still be reviewed and passed by the Legislative Yuan before it can be promulgated and implemented by the National Government." The main points of the revision are described below in the order of each chapter of the Publication Law:</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe; Dedicates Poem to Celebrate Chairman's Birthday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] On the 31st, which is the Chairman's 60th birthday, the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe presented three poems titled "The Great Leader" to the Chairman, expressing their respect. The original poems, translated into Chinese, are as follows: "We warmly salute you, Great Leader Chairman Chiang! We hold you in high esteem, Wise Leader Chairman Chiang! Long live, long live, long live! Leader of the entire people, you are the great leader! Long live the leader! The enemies who destroy peace should be completely eliminated. Under the leadership of the Chairman, we live freely. In the paradise of democracy, we are building a new China."</p>
<h3>Wei LiHuang Arrives in Nanjing; Anhui Natives Welcome Him With Tea Party Yesterday in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[This City News] General Wei Lihuang and his wife took the military flight to Nanjing at 11 PM on the 30th. They will pay their respects to the Chairman and report their inspection. The Anhui natives in Shanghai held a tea party yesterday at the Jin Gu Hotel on Xizang Road to welcome him. More than a hundred Anhui natives such as Yang Hu, Fang Zhi and their wives attended. During the tea party, Wei LiHuang stood up and shared his opinions of the inspections, praising the progress of European and American countries and the law-abiding spirit of the people. He hopes that the people will be strong and complete the mission to eradicate the rebellion and build the nation.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Members in Kang Province; Limited Time to Register and Withdraw From the Party; Otherwise Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Ya'an Dispatch, 30th] The Kang Province Security Command has decided that all communist party members and staff, who are new or old, local or not, who are willing to withdraw from the party must find a guarantor and register with the County government before November 15. Or else, the local security will arrest them.</p>
<h3>Key points of revision</h3>
<p>Chapter 1 General Principles, no revisions except for Articles 2 and 8. Article 2 Paragraph 2: "Magazines use a fixed name and keep being issued every week or every 3 months. But if the content is mainly about current events, it will be considered a newspaper.” The revised text is: “Magazines use a fixed name, bind them and the issue frequency will be between 6 days and 3 months.” The original explanation of this paragraph has been removed this time. Article 8 stated the publication must be handed in to many different organizations. This has been revised and split into Article 16 and Article 19 in Chapters 2 and 3. Article 8 has been newly added. The content is: "Foreigners may apply to issue publications in accordance with the provisions of this law and abide by all laws and regulations of China regarding publications, but if the publication law of the foreigner's home country has differential treatment for Chinese people, they should not enjoy the treatment granted by this law." This article is based on the principle of equality and reciprocity in international relations and need no more explanations.</p>
<p>The main revision about the registration of newspapers and magazines in Chapter 2 involves Article 9. The revision reduces the approval time for newspapers and magazines. This shows the government is convenient to the publication business. The statement “After issuing the registration certificate, the Ministry of Internal Affairs must copy the registration application to the Central Propaganda Department” has been removed. Since the end of the tutelage, the implementation of the publication law has been transferred to government agencies. Political parties no longer participate. Article 9 Paragraph 1: “The publisher of a newspaper or magazine must submit an application form before the first issue. The local authority where the publishing location will submit the application to the Provincial Government or the Municipality directly under the Executive Yuan within 15 days. The Provincial Government or the Municipality directly under the Executive Yuan should approve it within 28 days and ask the Ministry of Internal Affairs to issue a registration certificate.” The revision changes “15 days” and “28 days” to “10 days” to shorten the approval period by one time. The phrase “Except for special circumstances” has been changed to “Approved according to the rules” to make the wording precise. The content in the back of Article 9 is the matters that the registration application must contain. Only the “Purpose of Publication” has been added. The rest has not been revised.</p>
<p>Article 12 of Chapter 2 states: "If a newspaper specializes in publishing communications, the local authority may send personnel to inspect its social organization and publishing status when necessary." After the revision, this article has been removed in order to fully protect the freedom of the press from any unnecessary administrative interference. Articles 13 to 16 have been moved up and changed to Articles 12 to 15. Article 14 (Article 13 of the revised text): "One who has been criminally punished for violating Article 21" has been changed to "One who has been criminally punished for violating Articles 21 and 22." Article 22 is a new article in Chapter 4. In addition, the provisions of the original articles in Chapter 2 have not been modified.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 About books and other publications, original articles 18 to 20. Article 20 states that “Political leaflets or slogans must not be printed or issued without the permission of the local authority.” This article has been removed to be in line with the spirit of freedom of speech. Also, Article 19 was added stating that the publisher must send 1 copy of the book to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Central Library and the Beiping library. Article 8 of the current Publication Law says all publications must be sent to many organizations. The amendment determines the publication to send according to their properties to reduce the number of copies that the publisher needs to send. (Continued in Column 1, Edition 2)</p>
<h3>After Consultation, Price Controls; Seven Resolutions on Fuel Controls; Coal Prices in Production Areas Increase by 40 Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The general price control issue was discussed at the meeting of the Full Economic Committee at 3 p.m. After the Shanghai price survey by the three committee members, the meeting decided on fuel control based on the committee members' suggestions: 1. Strengthen transportation. All empty trains returning from military transport must transport coal. 2. Repair damaged mining areas and railways. 3. Rationally allocate coal. 4. Crack down on the black market and strictly combat smuggling. 5. Encourage transportation and sales, and crack down on unscrupulous merchants profiting illegally. 6.

<p>[Another Dispatch] At the meeting of the Full Economic Committee, the price survey report submitted by relevant parties was read out. According to the survey, the reasons for the price increase are as follows: The government's price control agencies failed to coordinate, such as the Textile Control Committee, which first led the price increase; The exchange rate fluctuates from time to time; Smuggling in Hong Kong and the volatility caused by "All-Access Permits"; More than 20 billion yuan of floating capital concentrated in the Northeast and North China, and the National Bank failed to contract its funds.</p>

<h3>General Order for Internal Elections; Strictly Prohibiting Election Fraud</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Ministry of Interior and the Election called on all provinces, stating: "If candidates buy off local evil forces, manipulate elections, and engage in banquets, gifts, or use money to attempt to be elected, it is enough to corrupt customs and suppress talent. It should be stopped immediately. Those with serious circumstances should be disqualified from being candidates according to law, and the relevant accomplices should be transferred to the court for punishment."</p>
<h3>Earthquakes in Nanchang and Taipei</h3>
<p>"Our Nanchang Dispatch, 30th] At 5:01:30 in the morning of the 30th, there was an earthquake. The houses shook, the cups and plates rang. It lasted for about 10 seconds.</p>

<h3>Incumbent Production Committee Members Participating in Elections; All Political Parties Should Support; Legislative Yuan Passes Temporary Motion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan held the 337th regular meeting on the morning of the 30th, presided over by President Sun, and discussed various election-related cases. First to discuss was the temporary motion of Legislator Liu Guanting and others, suggesting that "the Legislative Yuan shall resolve that the National Government shall notify all political parties that all current legislators, unless they voluntarily give up the election, shall be nominated and supported by all political parties as candidates for Legislative Committee." During the discussion of this case, legislators of the Kuomintang spoke enthusiastically, and legislators of the Min and Qing parties also spoke in support. They all agreed that current legislators are experienced experts with rich knowledge and should not be rejected. At the same time, current legislators are formally appointed after being selected by the Political Conference, the Supreme National Defense Council, and the National Defense Conference. Since they are nominated by political parties, legislators should be on the support list of various political parties. At the same time, parliaments in various countries retain a portion of the old members in each re-election. Even if all current legislators are elected, it would still be less than one-fifth of the total. Furthermore, legislators have continuity and technicality, and current legislators should be nominated as candidates for future legislators. It was passed without objection.</p>
<h3>Female Legislator Candidates; Not Just Filling Numbers</h3>
<p>Following was the discussion of the proposal by Legislator Tan Tiwu and others, that female legislators should be based on academic qualifications, experience, and social status as standards, and should not be filling numbers based on personal relationships. They suggested that the National Government should notify all parties to pay attention to this point when submitting the list of candidates. During the explanation of the original proposal, Tan Tiwu pointed out that the female legislator candidates nominated in various places were of uneven quality, and there were questions about their academic qualifications and experience. They were often produced based on personal relationships and did not value talent. This election is extremely important for our future constitutional prospects, and attention should be paid to this phenomenon. Zhong Tianxin and others believed that no one should avoid relatives in internal recommendations. If they are truly talented, relatives and friends may also propose them. Finally, the original proposal was passed.</p>
<p>Then, the following were passed: *Revised Implementation Regulations for the Election and Recall of Representatives of the National Assembly and Legislators, including the format of the election certificate and the description of the election ballot.* *The number of signatures of candidates from the five groups of freelance journalists, lawyers, technicians, accountants, doctors, and pharmacists has been reduced to at least 50 people.*</p>
<p>Finally, the remedial measures for the difficulty of electing representatives to the National Assembly and legislators in the pacification area were discussed. During the review, a draft supplementary regulation for the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators was drafted. During today's meeting, there was a fierce debate about whether the representatives should be re-elected after the pacification area was recovered. Most of the northern legislators agreed that there was no need to re-elect after the election had been held in order to disturb the local area. President Sun and others pointed out that the people have the right to vote and be elected and cannot be deprived of it. It was decided to resubmit for review. (Revised articles of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, etc., are published in Column 2, Edition 2)</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] U.S. aid to China has now entered the action phase. After the signing of the Sino-American Relief Agreement, materials including food and equipment for increased production, as well as fuel, medicine, and machinery, will soon be shipped to China in large quantities to carry out the work of relieving the people and stabilizing society. Authoritative sources told reporters that the assistance granted to China under this agreement is the beginning of a series of friendly aid efforts. Although the White House still focuses most of its attention on European affairs, and even believes that China still needs to undertake certain reforms to fully qualify for assistance, it has indeed heard the voices of the people and knows that the overall situation in the Far East can no longer be delayed. Although General Wedemeyer's report and aid plan recommendations have not been published, they cannot delay the awakening of American public opinion. The American public has begun to face the crisis in the Far East and is concerned about the situation in China. The U.S. government will surely understand public opinion and actively strengthen its aid to China. The source could not confirm the reports that the first batch of U.S. aid planes and munitions had already begun shipping to China, but they definitely stated that the negotiations between China and the U.S. on a loan to stabilize China's currency system have made considerable progress. The amount of this loan, if based on Bullitt's suggestion, would be $150 million, but the exact number is currently a closely guarded secret. According to reporters' inquiries, U.S. aid to China will be provided in stages, with the first batch totaling approximately $100 million, and subsequent batches will be determined gradually and arrive continuously.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th] Under Secretary of State Lovett announced at a press conference today that a decision on U.S. policy toward China could be made as soon as Secretary of State Marshall returns to Washington from the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Burmese Independence and Sino-Burmese Relations</h3>
<p>Since India and Pakistan gained independence, the Burmese people have also actively moved towards independence, completing another bloodless revolution in history. According to London sources, the Burmese delegation, led by Prime Minister Nu, signed the Anglo-Burmese Treaty with British Prime Minister Attlee on October 17th, stipulating that Britain will transfer power to the independent new Burmese government in January next year. On the 24th, the British Parliament convened, and Attlee proposed the Burmese Independence Act, which smoothly completed the legislative procedures. On the 26th, the British Secretary of State for Burmese Affairs, Listowel, officially announced the "Burmese Independence Act" and the "Anglo-Burmese Treaty." The Act stipulates that Burma will become an independent nation from January 6th next year, neither a part of the British Commonwealth nor under British protection. The treaty recognizes the Burmese Republican Federation as a fully independent sovereign state, with both sides appointing appropriate diplomatic representatives. The British Burmese Affairs Department will also be closed on January 6th next year. At the same time, the treaty stipulates the Anglo-Burmese military relationship, with Britain enjoying special interests in the military, and Burma not accepting any country's defense representatives. The Anglo-Burmese trade relationship will adopt a reciprocal approach, similar to the U.S.-Philippines treaty relationship. But in any case, this is a historical event with new significance. The enlightened British government has fulfilled its promise to abandon its colonial policy, adding luster to the spirit of the Atlantic Charter; and the Burmese nation has completed its mission of national liberation and national independence in the bloodless revolutionary process of India and Pakistan, which is equally worthy of our celebration.</p>
<p>Burma is located at the narrowest point of the Malay Peninsula, and its continental borders are closely connected with our country. According to the 1940 League of Nations Yearbook, Burma has an area of ​​261,610 square miles and a population of 16 million, including Burmese, Karen, Shan, Indian, and Chinese people. Its transportation with India is mainly through the port of Rangoon. The Burmese people are the most dynamic ethnic group in Southeast Asia and are accustomed to farming, earning them the early title of "Land of Bliss" in Asia. This industrious nation has its ancient history; from the sixth to seventh centuries AD, it was a feudal fiefdom individually established by nobles. From the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, the feudal lords were positioned among the merchant class, not only establishing huge cities, but also establishing business connections with southern China and Nanyang, and establishing a powerful national kingdom. At that time, Buddhism was also introduced from India, and culture gradually developed. Until the fourteenth century, it still maintained its independence. In its external relations, Burma defeated the invasion of the Mongol Empire; it was not until the nineteenth century that it was defeated in three wars against Britain and became a colony of the British Empire. The tragic fate of the Burmese nation began at this time.</p>
<p>The British Empire regarded Burma as "the pearl in the British crown." For the rule of India, Hong Kong, and Malaya, it had to occupy Burma. At the same time, in order to compete with France in the Far East, it did not hesitate to invest gold pounds in operating Burma. In 1886, Burma was declared a part of the British Empire and incorporated into India. At the same time, the British Empire, in order to implement the traditional policy of "divide and rule," divided Burma into upper and lower regions, establishing a collection of dozens of small kingdoms into a federation, similar to the technique of ruling India. In 1937, based on the recommendations of the Simon Commission, the separation of India and Burma was implemented, directly under the management of the British Emperor, with a Burmese Affairs Department set up internally to guide the administration of the Governor of Burma; under the Governor was a Burmese Parliament, divided into upper and lower houses. Therefore, Burma was neither a colony nor a dominion, but a semi-autonomous territory of the British Empire. The Burmese nation is full of vitality. Although they were dissatisfied with British rule, they contributed manpower and materials to the Allied countries during this war, and provided territory and airspace for the Allied forces to fight against Japan. Even under Japanese occupation, they were unyielding. After the war ended, the British Labour Party came to power. Burma's independence, following Egypt and India, is not only a wise move by the British government, but also an inevitable trend in post-war world politics. Looking at the British government and Parliament's rapid and decisive decision, the British sincerity in receiving Nu, although the crown of the British Empire has lost its brilliant pearls, it has added world friends on the road of self-reliance in the new Britain, and left the most memorable page in the national liberation movement. We really admire the far-sighted and courageous approach of British politicians.</p>
<p>We are particularly excited about Burma's independence. The future independent diplomatic relations between China and Burma will surely increase day by day, which will be conducive to the stability and prosperity of both countries. In history, Sino-Burmese relations have a very glorious chapter; geographically and strategically, the two countries have a relationship of sharing weal and woe. The Sino-Burmese border area, adjacent to Yunnan and Xikang, has three major rivers (Nujiang, Lancangjiang, and Jinshajiang), and it encompasses the areas of Pianma, Jiangxinpo, etc., which are related to our country's southwestern border and are also a fortress for our southwestern national defense. Its gains and losses are of great importance to our country's destiny. Unfortunately, boundary disputes have occurred from time to time over the years, so the Sino-Burmese border has not yet been demarcated, and as a result, commercial exchanges between the two countries also lack normalcy. Now that Burma has gained independence, our country has exchanged ambassadors with it, and the boundary demarcation issue is also in progress, which is a prelude to the improvement of Sino-Burmese relations.</p>
<p>We congratulate Burma's independence and hope for the success of Burma's constitution-making and its path to democracy and freedom. The stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia hinge on the future friendship between China and Burma. Our country's ancient world policy has always regarded "reviving extinguished states, continuing interrupted lineages, and generous gifts and meager returns" as an ideal. Looking at today's world, given the geographical and strategic importance of China and Burma, we deeply hope that the new Burma will choose the path of Sino-Burmese cooperation and friendship, break the stalemate of Sino-Burmese boundary disputes over the years, and then rebuild Sino-Burmese commercial relations. Southeast Asia is a land of kindness and compassion. We wish that the two peoples of China and Burma will cooperate friendly and forever bathe in the sea of peace and tranquility!</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang Talks About the Publication Law</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Chapter 4, regarding the restrictions on the matters to be published in publications, in addition to the change in the order of the articles, the content includes the modification of two articles and the addition of two articles. Article 21 of the original text stipulates: "Publications shall not record any of the following statements or propaganda: 1. Those who intend to destroy the Kuomintang or oppose the Three People's Principles; 2. Those who intend to subvert the National Government or harm the interests of the Republic of China; 3. Those who intend to disrupt public order." The revised article is as follows: "Publications shall not record any of the following statements or propaganda: 1. Those who intend to subvert the government or endanger the Republic of China; 2. Those who harm diplomatic relations; 3. Those who intend to harm public interests or disrupt social order." Article 22, a "newly added article" in the amendment, stipulates: "Publications shall not record anything that damages the reputation of the head of state of this country or friendly countries." Article 24, a "newly added article," stipulates: "Publications shall not record anything that damages the reputation and credibility of others." The addition of Article 21, paragraph 2 and Article 22 aims to promote the consolidation of diplomatic relations and express due respect to the heads of state of this country and friendly countries. In addition to protecting freedom of speech, the Publication Law also takes into account the protection of private reputation to prevent the prevalence of defamation, so Article 24 has been added. In addition, Article 23 of the original text of Chapter 4, that is, Article 25 of the amendment, after being revised, adds "Publications shall not criticize events that are in the process of litigation" to the original provision that "Publications shall not publish debates on cases in which public litigation is prohibited," so as to protect the dignity of the judiciary. Article 26 of the amendment, that is, the original Article 24, has not been modified in content. Its significance is to reserve the power that the government should have in wartime or in the event of turmoil. It is not true that the revised Publication Law is tantamount to restoring the newspaper censorship system.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Administrative Penalties, in addition to the change in the order of the articles, the content includes the modification of five articles, the addition of one article, and the deletion of three articles. Article 30 of the amendment (original Article 28) and Article 36 (original Article 34) have been modified as follows due to the change in the order of the articles and the addition of articles in Chapter 4: Article 30, if the Ministry of Interior believes that a publication contains one of the items listed in Article 21, or violates the prohibitions and restrictions stipulated in Articles 22 and 26, it may specify the item and prohibit the publication and distribution of the publication, and may seize it when necessary. (The latter part has not been revised and is the same as the latter part of the original Article 28).</p>
<p>Article 36, if the content of a publication violates the provisions of Article 23, Article 24, or Article 25, and the circumstances are serious, the Ministry of Interior or the local competent authorities shall, after submitting it to the Ministry of Interior for approval, prohibit its sale and distribution, and may seize it when necessary. (The latter part has not been revised and is the same as the latter part of the original Article 34). In addition, Article 37 (original Article 35) regarding the case of the publisher stipulates the punishment that should be imposed for sending its publications. The current article stipulates a fine of 30 yuan, which has been changed to "If the publisher fails to comply after being urged, a fine of more than 50 times the price of the publication shall be imposed." In addition, the fine stipulated in Article 38 (original Article 39) has been changed from "100 yuan" to "1,000 yuan" after revision, and there are no other modifications. Article 33 of the amendment, regarding publications issued abroad that should be prohibited from import, is the original Article 31. Among them, there are only necessary modifications due to the change in the article number, and the substance is exactly the same as the original article.</p>
<p>Articles 36, 37, and 38 of the current Publication Law, which stipulate various fines, have all been deleted.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 41 stipulates that "In addition to the penalties imposed separately in accordance with the above articles, those who violate the provisions of this Law and commit crimes stipulated in the Criminal Law shall be handled in accordance with the Criminal Law." Although this article is a newly added independent article in form, the first sentence of Article 34 of the current Publication Law also contains the same meaning.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 of the current Publication Law, Penalty Provisions, consisting of eleven articles, has been completely canceled. In other words, according to the draft amendment, if a person engaged in publishing violates the provisions of Chapter 4, the publication may be subject to administrative penalties, but the individual's punishment shall be handled in accordance with the Criminal Law and is not within the scope of administrative penalties. From this, it can be seen that the government intends to protect human rights and respect the spirit of the rule of law. Chapter 7 of the current Publication Law, Supplementary Provisions, has been changed to Chapter 6, and the content has not been modified. (End)</p>

<h3>Authorities Have Not Placed Key Members of the China Democratic League in North China Under Surveillance</h3>
<p>"Our Peiping Dispatch, 30th" Zhang Shenfu, the person in charge of the North China branch of the China Democratic League, told reporters today: "Even if the government orders the China Democratic League to disband, we will immediately comply with the order to disband." Zhang said that he has not been subjected to surveillance, and said that he and others are frank and open-minded and have no fears. Members of the China Democratic League have no actions that harm the government, and the North China branch has no activities, is silent, and is equivalent to being disbanded. Another key member of the China Democratic League, Zhang Dongsun, is still teaching at Yanjing University. The North China authorities have not taken action against the members of the China Democratic League. It is reported that the handling method will be decided at the Executive Headquarters meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei of the China Democratic League continued to visit Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and others on the 30th, requesting that they be allowed to lift the surveillance on them. According to Luo, they very much hope that the government will issue an order to disband the China Democratic League, because if the China Democratic League is regarded as an illegal national entity by the government, it will not be able to carry out activities, so it is better to disband it. It is reported that the government may take further measures in this regard.</p>
<h3>Shen Junru of the China Democratic League Transfers the Properties of the Communist Party Under Management to the Police Bureau</h3>
<p>"Our Dispatch" The China Democratic League managed two properties of the Communist Party in Shanghai. Among them, the Zhou Enlai residence on Sinan Road was taken over by Chen Zhiqin, the director of the Lujiawan Police Branch Bureau, who led his troops there in person at 4:00 PM yesterday. Shen Junru of the China Democratic League came forward to handle the handover procedures. All the internal properties were used by the China Industrial and Commercial School and the Children's Welfare Fund Raising Association, so the Huangpu Branch Bureau was unable to take over yesterday and has reported to the superior authorities for instructions.</p>
<h3>U.S. Acting Secretary of State Talks About the Issue of China Banning the China Democratic League</h3>
<p>"U.S. News Service, Washington, 29th" Acting Secretary of State Lovett was asked by someone at a press conference today to comment on the news of the Chinese government banning the China Democratic League. He said that he had received a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to China confirming the news. The State Department is currently trying to obtain a more detailed report.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th] Lovett said at a press conference that the United States will continue to take its consistent stance, that is, the United States should do its best to advise the Chinese government to grant the leaders of the China Democratic League a fair and public trial so that they have the opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 29th] Congressman Marcantonio of the Labor Party and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt had a debate on a radio broadcast last night. It is said that China's recent banning of the China Democratic League is the achievement of a "dictatorial government," but Bullitt said that the Chinese government declared the China Democratic League an illegal organization because it "is only the tail of the Communist Party."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cultural Circles Hold a General Mobilization Meeting to Support the Government's Dissolution of the China Democratic League</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, This City Dispatch" The Shanghai Cultural Circles Save the Nation General Mobilization Association held a meeting in the afternoon of the 30th to invite people from the news and cultural circles to exchange opinions on the government's dissolution of the China Democratic League. More than 30 people from the cultural circles, including Fang Zhi and Feng Youzhen, attended. The Association also issued a declaration yesterday to support the government's banning of the China Democratic League. The declaration pointed out that the emergence of the China Democratic League was based on political speculation, with no ideology and no political program, so the center of gravity shifted at any time and the rhetoric was contradictory. When the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were negotiating, the China Democratic League considered itself a "third party." Until the Communist bandits openly rebelled, opposed the National Assembly, and opposed the Constitution, the League revealed its true colors, and all its claims were completely in tune with the Communist bandits. Furthermore, it instigated student unrest, incited worker unrest, opposed conscription, and opposed grain policy. Anything that the Communist Party found inconvenient or unable to come forward was handled by the League. In the bandit areas, it sent personnel to participate in the work of harming the country, driving good people into misery. In the rear, it chanted the so-called opposition to civil war. Overseas, it declared the overthrow of the government. In China, it deliberately distorted peace, advocating democracy everywhere, but in reality, it was creating turmoil. It talked about unity to everyone, but specialized in sabotaging laws and discipline.</p>
<h3>Sale of State-Owned Enterprises</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) The government designates national banks and invites banking organizations to form a fundraising syndicate, designating one or two banks as conveners. Their task is to sell the business units in accordance with government regulations, plan the organization of the new company each year, and handle the fundraising, collection, and transfer of funds for the new company's shares. The syndicate is located in Shanghai, with offices in various provinces and cities. Determine the reserve price for each business unit separately for sale, with the principle of organizing a new company for each unit. For each unit approved for sale, the syndicate shall determine the amount of capital of the new company as determined by the government's valuation, and publicly raise shares, which shall be supervised by the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises. After the syndicate has raised enough funds for each unit's shares, it shall immediately set a deadline to collect the funds and hand them over to the national treasury, and assist the new company's shareholders' meeting to generate the persons in charge of the new company and take over the business from the government. However, in order to speed up the sale of state-owned enterprises, it may first set a deadline to collect the funds that have been raised, hand them over to the treasury, and establish a new company after more than half of the shares have been raised. The shares that have not been raised will still be entrusted to the syndicate by the government for continued sale, and the price may be increased by the government at any time.</p>
<h3>Wartime Japanese Atrocities: More Than a Thousand Chinese Laborers Killed; Allied Headquarters Sends Personnel to China to Investigate Evidence</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 30th] Morrison, a legal advisor to the Judicial Department of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo, came to Tianjin from Japan to investigate evidence of Japanese mistreatment of Chinese laborers. He is scheduled to go to Peiping on the 31st, and then fly to Shanghai and then to Tokyo. He told reporters about the tragic fact that more than a thousand pen laborers were tortured to death by the Japanese in a certain mining area in northern Kyushu, Japan in 1945. He said: At that time, more than a thousand Chinese laborers were transported from the concentration camp to a certain mining area in northern Honshu to work as forced laborers. More than 400 people died one after another due to hunger and illness. The remaining pen people, unable to bear the abuse, finally rioted on July 1, 1945, and beat several self-defense soldiers to death. Afterwards, the hundreds of Chinese were tied up under the pressure of bayonets and stood in the scorching sun, and were cut off from food and drink for five days, resulting in the deaths of countless people. When Morrison talked about this tragic past, he showed a stack of lists, but the Japanese mostly filled in the cause of death as "dysentery." Morrison hopes to obtain evidence of this Japanese atrocity in order to file a public prosecution against the abusers.</p>

<h3>Activities of the Democratic League in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Dagong] The activities of the Democratic League members in Shanghai's labor circles in compliance with the law are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the leaders of the Democratic League, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and others came to Shanghai one after another, secretly instructing their followers to infiltrate Shanghai's labor circles and organize workers' associations, belonging to the National Salvation Association. Under the Workers' Association, there are two organizations: Company and Business Friendship Association and All Trades Alliance. In addition, it developed peripheral organizations and infiltrated other groups, such as the Youth Federation, Guangming Theater, and Amateur Opera Society, Qingguang Society, Youth Troupe, and various women's cram schools, workers' cram schools, etc. in the dense labor areas of East and West Shanghai. Although its Friendship Association and Alliance are organizations of the Democratic League, they are actually under the command of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions of the Communist Party of China. Before the withdrawal of the Communist Party of China, Li Xiongxiang, Guan Tianzhong, and Ge Qiying, the persons in charge of the Federation of Trade Unions, as well as Hua Gang, the person in charge of the Labor Department of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Jiachen, the person in charge of the Trade Union Department of the Communist Party of China, issued secret orders from time to time.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 34th year of the Republic of China, workers demanded adjustment of their treatment due to high prices. Therefore, members of the Democratic League seized the opportunity to instigate labor unrest in factories one after another, to achieve the purpose of destroying society and overthrowing the government.</p>
<p>In the second half of November of the 35th year, the Democratic League launched a signature campaign against the United States in the factories in East and West Shanghai, especially in Yizhong Fuxin Tobacco Factory, Chongxin Yarn Factory, Huaitong Woolen Mill, Jinglun Yarn Factory, and Yuanfeng Yarn Factory. At the same time, Ying Qi, a cadre of the Democratic League, repeatedly threatened Chen Jieru, a female cigarette worker (now a labor senator), to join the Democratic League and lead the anti-American work, but Chen refused.</p>
<p>After the beginning of this year, Luo Longji, Deng Chumin, and Guo Moruo, who were close to the Democratic League, secretly instructed their henchmen Chen Shijun, Wu Cheng, Ding Shengya, and others to convene a meeting to love and use domestic goods and resist American goods for many months. It was not until February 9th of this year that it was convened at the Quan Gong Building, and the Liang Renda blood case occurred.</p>
<p>On the day of the "February 9th" incident, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Shi Liang, and others met with Han Wucheng, Ding Shengya, and others at their residence to discuss countermeasures. Shi Fuliang, who was left-leaning, personally drafted the propaganda for the Liang case, which was printed by Guoguang Printing House at No. 40, Lane 383, Dagu Road, and sent to various parties for distribution. The article "My Experience of Being Beaten" published by Ding Shengya in Wen Wei Po on February 23 was revised by Zhang Bojun and Shen Junru.</p>
<p>On June 15th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a secret order to the student and labor movement elements, instructing them to turn to underground labor movement in the future. The labor movement elements of the Democratic League also cooperated in carrying out the movement. During the months of July and August, the Friendship Association of the Six Public Utilities and the Trade Union of the Three District Department Stores convened meetings to secretly discuss the progress. First, the Democratic League in the power workers took the lead. On August 14th, when General Wedemeyer was about to arrive, they used the excuse of the capital preventing them from holding a labor-capital symposium and went on strike for three hours in the writing room on Nanliang Road. The Yangshupu Power Plant responded at the same time. The next day, the Feilun Road Power Plant also went on strike for half an hour. The lights in the Taoyuan Road Lizhi Society Reception Center, where General Wedemeyer was staying, were also destroyed by them and went out once.</p>
<p>The authorities then tried their best to investigate and found reactionary documents printed by the Democratic League in Futong Printing House on Weihaiwei Road on September 19th. Wu Kewen and others, the traitors of the Power Workers' Union, were also inside, and they were arrested. At this point, the Democratic League members hiding in the trade unions of various public utilities were greatly panicked, so they made a desperate move, launching labor unrest in British and French companies and power companies through Ouyang Zirun of the Power Workers' Union, Chen Shijun of the Three District Department Stores, Zhu and Liu of the French companies. After frequent suppression, an order to reorganize the Power Workers' Union was issued on September 25, expelling 29 reactionary elements such as Wu Kewen. On September 29, the French Concession Power Workers' Union was reorganized, expelling 10 workers such as Zhu Xinxin. On September 30, the Three District Department Store Trade Union was reorganized and Chen Shijun, Ding Shengya, and other 10 people were arrested. This matter came to an end.</p>

<p>The United States' amendment further suggested: "To facilitate and expedite such participation, and to ensure that these Korean representatives are elected by the Korean people and not appointed by the Korean military authorities, a United Nations Temporary Committee on Korea should be established immediately, stationed in Korea, and authorized to travel, inspect, and consult throughout Korea." The Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia immediately opposed the United States' amendment, stating that this amendment added another technicality to the procedural issue.

<h3>Gun-Wielding Robbers Hijack Car and Wreak Havoc; They Are Unable to Escape in Front of the Municipal Police Bureau and Are Arrested and Tried; They Still Attempt to Seize a Gun</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A Russian woman named Heicha, lives in a foreign-style house at 68 Yongfu Road. She opened the Meili Company in the Overseas Chinese Bank Building on Central Road, dealing in coal. Recently, she purchased a 1947 Chevrolet champagne sedan, license plate number 53936, and hired a driver named Zhan Shiming. Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, Heicha was having lunch at home, and the car was parked in the garden, with driver Zhan Shiming sitting inside. Suddenly, a robber wearing a light gray suit and thick glasses jumped into the car, pulled out a gun, and threatened the driver to drive towards Hongqiao Road. The driver was forced to follow the indicated route. When they reached a remote area of Hongqiao Road, the robber pushed Zhan out of the car and drove away himself. Later, Zhan walked back and reported the situation to the Xujiahui Police Station. Branch Chief Song Anmin sent police officers to search for the car in all directions and contacted the owner, Heicha, who urgently called the company and ordered employee Ding Yuanhai to accompany her to the police station. While Ding was in a rented car passing Xizang Road, he suddenly saw car number 53936 heading north, turning towards Fuzhou Road. Ding quickly turned the car around and chased after it. Near the Xiaocai Chang market on Zhejiang Road, he tried to intercept the car, but the robber inside noticed him and drove forward, disregarding everything, causing the tricycle in front of him, number 13765, to overturn. When he drove to the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, on the east side of the Municipal Police Bureau, he encountered a red light, and a trolleybus number 359 was stopped on Jiangxi Road. The car, due to excessive speed, damaged the rear of the trolleybus. Soon after, Ding Yuanhai arrived in his car and reported to guards Sun Jianhua (131), Dai Chuan (216), and Chen Dingxin (189) of the Municipal Police Bureau, who intercepted the car. The robber attempted to draw his gun to resist arrest, but fortunately, the police were vigilant and held him back. The robber then pulled out another gun from his left pocket and attempted to fire, but one of the police officers tackled him to the ground, grabbing his legs, and he was finally subdued. Two .38 caliber revolvers and twenty-eight bullets were confiscated. After being taken to the police station, the head of the security section, Lu Dagong, personally interrogated him. The robber remained defiant and pretended to be the owner of the car. During the intense questioning, he unexpectedly grabbed a gun from the table and attempted to commit suicide, but fortunately, the gun was not loaded, and it was taken away from him. He confessed his name as Chen, from Guangdong, 23 years old, and admitted to the car robbery. He was later transferred to the criminal investigation department for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Performing Arts Industry Does Not Accept Winter Relief Dues Added to Ticket Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Winter Relief Association intends to raise funds for disaster relief by adding a 20% winter relief due to the ticket prices of various entertainment businesses. Yesterday morning, Yuan Wenzhang, the fourth director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened a meeting with persons in charge of the drama and film industries to discuss the matter. Both industries expressed reluctance. Representatives of the Peking opera industry stated that various Peking opera theaters are facing difficulties in maintaining operations due to high expenses. Theaters such as Tianchan and China must sell 80% of their seats to break even, and many smaller theaters are suffering losses and relying on high-interest loans to stay in business. Adding another 20% donation would definitely affect their business. Representatives of the film industry also stated that the fundraising for the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi has just ended, and the business of movie theaters is not as good as before. Adding another 20% donation would affect their business. Both industries suggested raising donations in other ways, such as charity performances, etc. Director Yuan proposed reducing the donation to 10% and trying it for half a month to see how it affects business before deciding whether to continue. However, the industries still expressed their inability to accept this. After two hours of discussion without a result, Director Yuan said that he would wait for the director of the Social Affairs Bureau to return from Beijing before discussing the matter further.</p>

At 10:00 AM, Zhan Peilin was summoned to the economic section of the police station for questioning and admitted that it was his.

Zhan was temporarily granted bail, and the section will investigate the account books and submit the case to the municipal government for review.</p>

<h3>Overdue Property Tax Settlement in Eleven Districts Will Be Subject to Fines</h3>
<p>The property tax settlement period for the eleven districts of Shanghai that have not yet undergone general land registration, including Pusong, Jiangwan, Pengpu, Wusong, Yinhang, Zhenru, Yangsi, Yangjing, Luxing, Gaohang, and Gaoqiao, was originally set to end in six months. However, because the city was only recently recovered, many property owners were unable to apply in time, and they requested an extension. The Land Administration Bureau forwarded the request to the Municipal Government, which approved extensions for three consecutive terms, each lasting six months, with November 25th of this year being the final deadline. The deadline is now approaching. It is reported that after this deadline expires, no further extensions will be granted. If property owners in these districts still hold untaxed blank deeds or deeds with forged stamps and do not comply with the deadline to apply to the Land Administration Bureau for tax collection, they will be subject to fines in accordance with the regulations for the implementation of property tax settlement. The fine standard is 10% to 100%.</p>

<h3>"Interrogation" of Xiaodan Gui Under Fatigue; Pushing for Confessions All Night Plants the Seeds of Disaster; Zhang Chunfan's 10,000-Word Confession Accuses Leng Shan of Alienating Affections; Shackled with Hands Behind His Back, He Appears Weak and Is Escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office Awaiting Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the Yue opera actress Xiaodan Gui committed suicide by taking poison, Zhang Chunfan, the manager of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, was suspected of abuse. After more than ten days of interrogation by the police bureau, Zhang was suspected of inciting suicide. Yesterday morning at 11:15 AM, Deputy Section Chiefs Ma Feimu and Chen Xianrong escorted Zhang, along with ten officers, and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office. Zhang was wearing a dark-colored long gown, and his hands were shackled behind his back. He appeared weak and exhausted. The court session began at 4:30 PM. Prosecutor Chen Shoutao briefly questioned him and ordered him to be detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Chunfan's informant: "I have never understood why Xiaodan Gui wanted to commit suicide. After her death, I didn't want to make the matter public, but my sworn sisters forced me very hard and insisted that I tell them the reason for her suicide. The cause of this incident was Leng Shan's alienation of my relationship with Xiao," and so on.</p>
<p>In the confession written by Zhang at the police station, which was over 10,000 words long, he placed the blame on Leng Shan and tried his best to avoid words such as abuse and humiliation. The following is an excerpt from his original text: "I came to Shanghai in 1919 and worked as a silk weaver in the Shanghai Weaving Factory in Chunyangli, Beikai'er Road. About half a year later, I became the manager of the Meili Silk Factory in Zhiyangli, Huishan Road, and was also a shareholder (accounting for one-third of 1,000 yuan). After a year, I rented out three iron weaving machines in the factory and bought two more machines, cooperating with Lao Zhennan. After more than a year in the Meili factory, the lease expired, and I took back the machines and merged them. Lao withdrew. Two years later, I rented 18 machines from the Guangqin Silk Factory on Tianbao Road and started work, serving as manager. After about seven or eight months, the Guangqin Factory failed and the lease was terminated. Because the houses in Zhiyang Road were taken back for personal use, they were all moved to Rihua Lane, Qiwupu Road, and renamed Risheng Silk Factory, with me serving as manager. I returned to my hometown during the Anti-Japanese War in 1926. Half a year later, I came to Shanghai again and saw that although the factory had been damaged by bombs, the machines were still there. I rented it to Hu Qiusheng, which had been going on for half a year.</p>
<h3>Meeting Xiaodan Gui</h3>
<p>Two months before the Anti-Japanese War, my fellow villager Zhu Zhimin invited Yue opera actresses to Shanghai for a hall performance to celebrate Fa Hang's birthday. Through the introduction of my friend Chen Rongchun, I met Xiaodan Gui. In the spring when Xiao was 22 years old, she and I became romantically involved. I married a woman from my hometown, Qiu Ruixuan (currently 33 years old), at the Mengyuan Hotel in Shanghai in 1925, and we now have four sons and two daughters. Xiaodan Gui is currently 28 years old. Her younger sister Qiong Yun was married to Wang Yueqing, an employee of the Tiantian Silk Factory Publishing House, in the second half of last year by Song Hua as matchmaker. I manage the front desk affairs of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater every day, and I am also responsible for the scriptwriting department. On the 7th of this month, around 5:00 PM, I was not at home, and Xiao went out alone. She did not return until around 11:00 PM. I returned home that day around 12:00 PM. However, I had returned home once around 6:00 PM and asked Xiao's sister because I didn't see Xiao. According to her, she went out around 5:00 PM in the afternoon. When I returned home around 12:00 PM, I asked Xiao where she had gone for dinner. She replied, "I had dinner at Yu's mother's house, and after dinner I went to see a movie with Yu's mother." I said, "Yu's mother is watching a play in the Guotai and has talked to me backstage." After thinking about it carefully, I realized that what she said was wrong. Xiao always said that she watched a movie with Yu's mother. When I said no, she said yes, so we argued a few sentences. I insisted on asking, and as a result, Xiao said, "The Yue opera fan who often writes letters (who lives in the hardware store on Jiangxi Road) wrote to me and asked me to watch a movie at the Xinguang Grand Theater on the 7th." I asked what happened after the movie. Xiao said, "After the movie, I took a rickshaw to the Jindao Grand Theater." I asked Xiao, "Where did you eat dinner?" Xiao said, "I ate at the restaurant across from the Jindao." I asked her what she ate. Xiao said, "Not snacks, not rice, just ate something casually." I said, "I don't believe it. You can't see two movies the first time you meet." I advised her and asked, "Why do you want to go see a movie with him?" Xiao said, "Curiosity." I said, "That's not allowed. You'll be looked down on. What face will you have when people see you two sitting in a rickshaw? You're not singing anymore. Preserving your reputation is the most important thing." Xiao replied, "That's right." She said, "I'm wrong, I'm wrong. It's really not this person."</p>
<h3>Using Liu Qiong's Mailbox</h3>
<p>I asked who it was. She said "okay" to me, got up, and went to the writing desk to write "Leng Shan" two words. I asked, "Where were you exactly?" Xiao said, "As long as my body is pure." She also said, "I went out around 5:00 PM and went to Jincheng to watch movies with Leng Shan. I hired a three-wheeled car to the back of the Firefly Theater and called a car to Zhao Zhuan Garden to stop, entered the road, and returned alone at 10:30." I asked, "Did you make the appointment by phone or by letter?" She replied, "By letter." I asked, "Where did these letters go through?" She replied, "Liu Qiong's mailbox." I asked, "Where is this mailbox?" She said, "On Masnan Road." I asked, "What did you talk about?" She said, "Leng Shan said he liked me very much, always loved me, spiritual love. I joked, I can't have love with you, you are a married man, and there are married women. Leng Shan said that his relationship with his wife was not good. I said, you loved her when you married her, why don't you love her now? It's okay to be friends with you, but love is absolutely impossible, and then we talked about filming a movie." I asked, "Did Leng Shan talk about me?" Xiao said, "Leng Shan said you have no sense of righteousness and are very stingy." I said, "How can you be so bold the first time you meet and talk about love? Tell me everything frankly." Xiao said, "When I do the play every night, Leng Shan helps me down, and we talk and talk every night, and feelings arise." I asked, "How many letters did you exchange?" Xiao replied, "Seven or eight." I asked, "What do the letters say? Where did the letters go?" Xiao said, "Don't ask me, I've already told you everything. Don't ask about the inside information in the letters, my body is absolutely pure." I said, "This is all a way to seduce you, deceive you. He has children. He is definitely cheating you out of your money and wants you to go to Hong Kong with him to make a movie." Xiao cried and said, "I'm awake." I said, "I'll discuss it with the scriptwriting department and tell him to make it clear, don't come and go, I'll call Liu Tao to come. (This was around 10:00 AM on the 8th, and we hadn't slept all night.)"</p>
<h3>Finding Leng Shan to Confront</h3>
<p>Then find Liu · Wu Chen, and tell Wu, "Leng Shan alienated us, please say something fair." Together we went to Leng Shan's home near the Lanyin Theater. In the car, I said to Leng, "Don't leave us two couples, making it difficult for her to be a person, you say some bad things." When we got to my house, Xiao sat on the bed wrapped in a quilt. We sat down, and Leng Shan sat opposite me. I asked Leng Shan, "You have to tell the truth, she told me everything last night." Leng Shan said, "I watched a play at Jinmen with a friend last night, and there is a war ticket stub to prove it." I said, "Don't lie. Where did you make the appointment? Where did you hire a car? Where did you stroll around the road? Did you open a room? You can speak well, it doesn't matter. Mr. Wu is your old friend for more than ten years. It's inconvenient for you to speak directly. You can go to the outer room and tell Mr. Wu." When I pointed at him, I knocked his glasses crooked. He took them off and pulled me to the outer reception room, admitting "I made an appointment by letter, hired a car behind the Dahua Theater to Zhao Feng Park, and later Xiao hired a three-wheeler to come back alone, but there was absolutely no relationship." Later, I scolded Leng Shan, warning him not to come and go with Xiao in the future. After I said this, I let it go. Unexpectedly, Xiao was so stimulated that she had suicidal thoughts and swallowed a large amount of Lysol on the afternoon of the 13th. She was rushed to Zhongmei Hospital, but she was too poisoned and died at 6:00 PM. This is something I didn't expect. I feel deeply sorry for Dan Gui and regret it."</p>
<h3>Bai Lu's Wrongful Death Case Opens; Elevator Model Lawyer Explains</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of the film star Bai Lu, who fell into the bottom of the elevator in the International Hotel on August 31 of this year, was seriously injured and died, was heard by Judge Zhong Xianda in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Whether the defendant Zhang Xilu was wearing black glasses, I don't know, but the glasses were not broken after the fall. If she had been wearing glasses, wouldn't they have been broken as well? Therefore, I don't think Bai Lu was wearing black glasses at the time. Then the elevator driver Zhang Xiliang of International No. 3, the defendant, testified: "I have been a driver at the International for eight years. The elevator is automatic. The door has two gears: the inner gear closes first, and the outer gear closes later. When the inner gear closes, the elevator goes up. At that time, elevator No. 3 was not damaged and had been inspected by the elevator repairman. I was above when the accident happened, and I didn't know." The court asked: Since the elevator has to wait for the inner gear to close before going up, how could Bai Lu get into the bottom? Zhang replied that the door was probably not completely closed, and Bai Lu pulled it open with her hand. Fujier, the manager of the International Hotel, testified: "On August 31, after hearing that someone had fallen, I went to investigate. The outer door of the elevator is usually closed with a gap of about four inches, and the elevator can go up. That day, I think Bai Lu pulled the outer door open and walked in with her hand." Liu Guangmao, the elevator repairman, said that the elevator had no problems. Finally, after the defendant's lawyer Eson explained the elevator model of the International Hotel, the court adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it. Next time, Tang Zhongqi, the waiter at the International Hotel who witnessed the scene, will be summoned to testify in court.</p>

<h3>Revival of Coastal Fisheries; Establishment of Fisheries Syndicate</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in view of the severe damage to my country's coastal fisheries during the war, believes that if a revival is not sought immediately, it will have a profound and significant impact on the future of the fishing industry, the livelihood of fishermen, and local public security. Relying solely on small loans is insufficient. In the past, a detailed plan was drafted to establish a fisheries syndicate. First, the Ministry of Agriculture would allocate a fixed amount of funds of several hundred million, and the circulating funds would be provided by the Zhongnong Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Trust Bureau, the Central Cooperative Treasury, Xinhua, Shanghai, Zhixing, Continental, Jincheng, Zhonghui, Siming, Yeye, Zhongnan, and the Savings Association of Four Banks, a total of fifteen banks. It is reported that the syndicate held its first executive board meeting the other day, electing Li Shuming as general manager, Qu Junyuan as manager, and Cong Congmin and Tang Kexiang as assistant managers. Its main businesses are: Fisheries lending. Operation of fisheries warehouses. Fishermen's savings. Shipbuilding and leasing of fishing boats. Processing and marketing of fisheries products. Once the office location is found, work will begin immediately.</p>

<h3>Case of Embezzlement Accusation Against Postal Remittance Bureau Staff: District Court Held Hearing Yesterday, Chief Auditor Presented Five Points Regarding Investigation Results</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The embezzlement case against staff of the Postal Remittance Bureau was heard yesterday at the District Court by Judge Wu Ronglin. The defendants present were Kong Guangxiao (Chairman of Lida Import and Export Company), Zhang Jiu (former Manager of the Chongqing Branch of the Postal Remittance Bureau, currently the Head of the Business Department of the Shanghai Branch, in charge of foreign exchange and overseas remittances), Ni Shurong (Director of the Savings Department of the Postal Remittance Bureau Secretariat), and Wang Xianghao (Staff Member of the Postal Remittance Bureau Loan Department, responsible for loan collateral). The nine defendants Shen Jing, Yu Zihong, Zhang Zhirong, Wu Yongnian, Chen Gongpei, Li Liangfu, Zhang Chunyi, Xu Jizhuang, and Peng Bingcheng were absent. Witnesses Zhou Yu, Wu Jiashan, He Jiayu, and Fang Jianbiao (Chief Auditor of the Postal Remittance Bureau Headquarters) were also summoned. First, Wang Xianghao testified: He initially worked on documentation at the post office, and since August of this year, he has been specifically managing mortgage collateral. However, whether the entire branch’s external collateral was handled solely by him is unclear. He also handled the Lida Company’s mortgage collateral, but he only checked whether the seals on the documents matched, and did not investigate the funds or quantity of goods on the collateral. Moreover, he was told to do so by the section chief, and he only stamped the documents after being instructed. Initially, he was very suspicious and did not understand why he was asked to stamp documents without knowing the mortgage recipient. The section chief explained that this was a confidential business procedure, so he did not inquire further. Shortly after the case occurred, Chief Auditor Fang from the headquarters came to investigate. Zhang Jiu testified: He was in charge of foreign exchange, overseas remittances, and communication with the Joint Treasury in the Shanghai branch. Because he was busy, he asked Ni Shurong for help, as Ni was an expert in foreign exchange research. The loan to Lida Company was approved by the director, who also gave specific instructions on how to proceed. Beforehand, Lida Company Manager Kong Guangxiao had reached an agreement with former Director Xu, and he initially proposed a monthly interest rate of 1.5% to be paid by Lida Company for the foreign exchange mortgage, as well as two shop guarantees. The Lida loan amounted to US$2 million (and he required a deposit of at least 30% of the total amount, and Lida paid US$600,000). Ni Shurong stated: He also managed the transfer of funds in the foreign exchange department, but did not know about the Lida foreign exchange mortgage. Kong Guangxiao stated: He contacted Xu Jizhuang for the foreign exchange mortgage from the Postal Remittance Bureau, and it was successful after one to three months. He intended to use this loan to purchase 10,000 tons of Western medicine from the US Army Shanghai Clearance Office. The Postal Remittance Bureau required him to use the Western medicine as collateral, and to repay the loan, including the US$600,000 deposit, from August to December. However, he still owed US$170,000, which was repaid with US dollar bonds. Next, witness Wu Jiashan testified: He had kept custody of Lida Company’s mortgage. On December 28th, he gave the mortgage to Kong Guangxiao on the order of Manager Shen (Jing). Zhou Yu (Accounting Department Staff) had prepared this voucher, but it was changed to Wang Xianghao due to an error. He Jiayu (Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Remittance Bureau) stated: He was not very clear about the matter upon joining the bureau. Fang Jianbiao presented five points regarding the investigation results: The Shanghai branch did not follow the rules for foreign currency mortgages. The bureau must submit a report to the headquarters for approval before conducting mortgage operations, but the Shanghai branch did so without reporting. The mortgaged goods never actually existed. The headquarters ordered Shen and Xu to explain the foreign exchange mortgage, but neither has provided an explanation to date. The mortgage exceeded the value of the collateral. As a result of the hearing, the case was adjourned for further hearing due to the absence of many witnesses. Kong Guangxiao provided five shop guarantees and a cash bail of 1 billion yuan. Zhang Jiu provided four shop guarantees and a bail of 400 million yuan. Ni Shurong provided two additional shop guarantees and a bail of 200 million yuan. Wang Xianghao provided an additional 200 million yuan and two shop guarantees.</p>
<h3>Report on Increased Air Freight Charges is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The air passenger and freight fares of China and Central Aviation Companies have increased twice in the past month, greatly affecting the general public and businesses. Recently, rumors have spread that there will be another adjustment at the beginning of next month. According to inquiries from relevant parties by our reporter, this is not true.

<h3>The Entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Transferred from Private to State Operation, Total Length 530 Kilometers, Promising Future for the Project</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 28th by Air] In 1936, when the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Company was first established, it signed a contract with Mr. M. Magot, a representative of a French bank. By 1937, the "alignment" survey for the entire 530-kilometer Chengdu-Chongqing railway line was completed, and the French side had shipped the first batch of 4,000 tons of railway materials from Paris. The materials were planned to be transshipped from Hong Kong to Sichuan. However, with the outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was delayed. The total budget for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project in 1937, according to a reporter's interview, was 75 million yuan. Although this year's budget has increased to 39 billion yuan, the person in charge of the project is still shaking his head, saying it’s not enough. Director Deng Yiguang went to Beijing on official business, and it was heard that the Executive Yuan recently approved an increase of 10 billion yuan per month for the Engineering Bureau starting in July. With the funds settled, if there are no unexpected problems, the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project can be completed in two and a half years. The section from Chongqing to Neijiang does not entirely follow the path of the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway (please refer to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway route map). All the large bridges and tunnels along the entire section were completed in 1940. Today, the main project is filling the roadbed. Because the hilly area requires extensive filling and deep excavation, up to 20 meters in some places, the Yu-Nei section, which is 280 kilometers long, requires 10,000 cubic meters of earth and stone. Construction of the Chongqing to Jiangjin section (60 kilometers) started five months ago and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Construction of the Jiangjin to Banqiao section (75 kilometers) started one month ago and is expected to be completed around April next year. The Engineering Bureau has decided to put the Banqiao to Neijiang section (150 kilometers) up for bidding on November 15th. However, at the Longchang Station in the Banqiao-Neijiang section, the bureau is using newly arrived American machinery to fill and excavate, testing how much faster the few machines are compared to manpower! As for the Neijiang to Chengdu section, it is 250 kilometers long (not passing through the mountainous area of Longquanyi Highway), and requires the construction of 13 tunnels and over 30 large bridges. West of Zizhong, the Liangfeng'ao Tunnel is the most challenging project, as it needs to be 500 meters long, and it will take a year and a half just to excavate it. Building the bridges is not too difficult, and the Engineering Bureau plans to start construction in the coming days. If all goes well, it can be completed before the flood season next year.</p>
<p>The French Shabano Bank came to Chongqing for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, but there was no result. The problem is how to calculate the French franc exchange rate in US dollars. It is said that there is currently a black market for the French franc, but the Shabano Bank hopes that the foreign material costs for the Engineering Bureau will be calculated at the official rate. However, the authorities believe that if ordering goods from France is valued according to the exchange rate set by the French, French goods will be much more expensive than American goods. This is the main reason for the delay in signing the contract.</p>
<p>A friend of the reporter went to the United States last year to inspect railway projects. In a train manufacturing plant, he met a representative of the French government who was negotiating with the American factory to order locomotives. After returning to China, he often doubted the production status of French industry. The reporter also asked a French friend about this issue. He frankly said: "Indeed, France has lost a war, but its recovery after victory is extremely fast. If the French government successfully signs a contract with the Chinese government for the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, France will definitely be able to deliver the goods in full within six months of signing the contract."</p>
<p>Currently, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been taken back under state operation, and the government is gradually refunding the previous private investments. As far as the reporter knows, it is not easy to rely on foreign industrial production to build a railway in the inland. During the peak flood season, the shipping capacity of the Sichuan River has never exceeded 30,000 tons, but a single-track 30-kilometer section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway requires 1,000 tons of steel rails. For a total length of 530 kilometers, how many ships, cars, and airplanes are needed to coordinate transportation!</p>
<p>However, the person in charge of the Engineering Bureau still has his vision and ambition. Under all kinds of difficult circumstances, he not only wants to complete the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, but also wants to build the Longzhu section (from Longchang to Guiyang). If this section of the railway is completed, Chongqing to Longchang will become a branch line. Guiyang, Longchang, and Chengdu will become the main line, and the entire southwest transportation will be transformed. The Longzhu section is 520 kilometers long, and the Engineering Bureau has sent four survey teams and one reconnaissance team to carry out the "preliminary survey" along the line.

<h3>The Origin of Chinese Culture: Lecture by British Expert in London</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 29th] Dr. Chattley delivered a highly interesting lecture here today at the China Society and the Chinese Universities Committee, entitled "The Origin and Propagation of Chinese Culture." The Chinese Ambassador to the UK chaired the lecture and praised Dr. Chattley for his extensive knowledge of China. It is reported that Dr. Chattley went to China to teach in 1908, and he came to the UK the following year to study. Over the subsequent decades, Dr. Chattley has held important positions related to China and has extensively studied Chinese culture. In his lecture, Dr. Chattley stated that for centuries, there have been constant explorations into the theory that Chinese culture originated in the West, but the theories of various schools of thought have failed to hold up after investigation. The most common argument is whether Chinese culture originated in Egypt. The conclusion of this question must first determine whether world culture originated in one place or developed independently in various locations. The doctor presented arguments for and against each theory. He stated that without extensive evidence, no single claim could be supported. He further mentioned that Egyptian culture can be traced back to 3,000 years ago, Phoenician culture to 2,000 years ago, Chinese culture to 2,000 years ago, and Central American culture to 500 years ago. This fact could indicate that culture originated in the Middle East and gradually moved eastward, crossing Asia and the Pacific to reach America. The differences in cultural patterns indicate regional developments. Dr. Chattley further pointed out that culture spreads through ideas to the world. Chinese culture, in many aspects such as porcelain, tea, paper, and printing, developed independently, but the invention of gunpowder and the compass remains to be investigated. He concluded by stating that most of Chinese culture originated from ideas. He further stated: "This theory is not intended to denigrate China but only to prove that world culture can only progress by strengthening and developing the connections between nations."</p>

<h3>15th Routine Meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee Passes Flower Purchase Price Negotiation Method, to Be Implemented in Six Districts Including Xi'an Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee held its 15th routine meeting at 4 PM yesterday, chaired by Liu Siying. First, the secretary and business departments reported, followed by the chairman reporting on the situation of attending the National Economic Conference in Beijing last Thursday, providing information on the flower yarn cloth price negotiation and joint distribution. Finally, the following proposals were discussed: The Flower Purchase Price Negotiation Method Proposal. Wu Weijing, Liu Gongyun, Li Shengbo, Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai and others all raised opinions. After detailed discussion, the method was amended and passed. The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Union proposed to participate in the price negotiation group. It was resolved that when cotton cloth price negotiation is implemented, a representative from the replication industry will be nominated to attend. The Raw Material Supply Subcommittee appointed Hu Jingliang as the chairman of the subcommittee, with Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, Liu Jingji, Pan Fuzhen representing the Bank of China and the Central Bank, Zhen Xiang representing the Chinese Farmers Bank, Gao Bingtai representing the Textile Adjustment Committee, and Liu Xun representing the Shanghai Cotton Business Association as members. The method of weaving cloth on behalf of others was decided to be discussed at the next general meeting.</p>
<h3>Flower Purchase Price Negotiation Method</h3>
<p>1.  This method is formulated in accordance with Article 2, Section 2, Chapter 1 of the Implementation Plan for Developing the Textile Industry and Adjusting the Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth.</p>
<p>2.  The joint intermediary price negotiation for flower purchase is temporarily implemented first in six districts, including Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Nantong, Hankou, and Shashi.</p>
<p>3.  Each of the above six districts shall establish a Cotton Price Negotiation Committee, jointly composed of representatives from the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Central Bank's Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, the China Textile Construction Company, the China Farmers Bank, private yarn factories, and the Cotton Business Association, to jointly negotiate prices, with the representative of the Central Bank serving as the first convener and the representative of the Textile Adjustment Committee serving as the second convener. In Shashi and Nantong, where there are no Central Bank branches, the representative sent by the Textile Adjustment Committee is responsible for convening, and local government officials are invited to participate when necessary.</p>
<p>4.  The price at which cotton merchants purchase flowers from farmers in the place of origin is temporarily based on the price of one city dan of 1-inch fine velvet white flower, equivalent to the price of seven city zu of medium wheat (North) or four city shi of medium white rice (South). It shall still be negotiated at any time with reference to the local supply and demand situation and production costs. For cotton that is longer or shorter than 1 inch, the Textile Adjustment Committee shall formulate a price ratio standard and notify the local price negotiation committees for reference.</p>
<p>5.  The price negotiation for flower purchase in the distribution market is based on the price of the place of origin, and transportation and payment fees may be added appropriately. However, in order to reduce the layer-by-layer price increases of intermediaries and to make the price negotiation stable and reasonable, the transportation and payment fees shall be strictly limited.</p>
<p>6.  Water and adulteration of cotton seriously hinders the price negotiation work. In the future, the cotton in the market in various places must be qualified by the local cotton inspection agency before it is allowed to be bought and sold.</p>
<p>7.  The price negotiation committees in various places shall report the negotiated prices and the total quantity of flowers purchased by various manufacturers to the Textile Adjustment Committee every day by urgent telegram for verification. If there is no change in the negotiated price, it must also be reported.</p>
<p>8.  For flower purchase manufacturers who violate the price negotiation, the price negotiation committee may request the local government to ban them.</p>
<p>9.  This method shall be implemented on November 1, 1947, and shall be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record.</p>
<h3>City Market Flooded with Chips, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Weak, 42-Count Blue Phoenix Continues to Drop by 900,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw an abundant supply of chips due to the large amount of yarn released by textile factories the previous day. Coupled with tight credit conditions at the end of the month, demand from all parties was sluggish. Factories, in turn, engaged in selling, while buyers remained on the sidelines, causing quoted prices to steadily decline. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by another 900,000 compared to the previous day, settling at 32.6 million. The prices of other counts of both coarse and fine yarns also uniformly decreased, ranging from 300,000 to about 1 million.</p>
<p>As for the cotton cloth market, initially, due to tight credit conditions, buyer activity remained limited, resulting in stable market conditions. However, around 11:30 AM, news of further declines in yarn prices dampened market sentiment, leading to a price slump. Eventually, various fine cloths, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, saw a drop of 5,000 compared to the previous day. Only a few batches of Five Blessings Blue Chicken saw increases of 5,000 to 10,000. Other cloths, due to sluggish sales, also experienced lackluster and lifeless market conditions.</p>
<p>Textile Factory Sales to the Market</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company, as usual, sold a total of 5,990 bolts of cloth, averaging 6,320 bolts per sales order. There were a total of 66 sales orders, including 6 orders from manufacturers purchasing 1,520 bolts and 60 orders with cloth numbers purchasing 4,470 bolts.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Market Mediocre</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was mediocre with sporadic transactions. The trend was initially flat, then softened. Due to the narrow margins on cotton yarn and the urgent need for funds at the end of the month to pay wages, yarn factories showed little interest in purchasing. Dealers still had strong intentions to enter the market, so prices remained at their original levels. Total transactions for the day amounted to 880 bales. The factory delivery price for cotton from Shashi was 3.687 million, and from Guide it was 3.2241 million. The warehouse delivery price was 3.77 million for Bao, 3.357 million for Shandong, 3.224 million for fine Han cotton, 2.976 million for sharp Haitian, and 3.621 million for Shashi cotton. Qidong cotton was priced at 3.266 million, Huoji cotton at 2.5 million, and Zhoupu cottonseed at 600,050.</p>
<p>National Economic Commission Conference Designates Eight Committee Members to Review Cotton Yarn Joint Allocation Methods</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The National Economic Commission held its 21st meeting this afternoon, chaired by Zhang Qun. Committee member Chen Qitian reported on the implementation of the Shanghai cotton yarn voucher joint allocation. The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the price issue (based on the report of the three committee members Liu Zhendong, Shi Kuiling, and Huang Yuanbin's investigation in Shanghai), A, for the cotton yarn and cloth issue, in addition to the cotton yarn voucher joint allocation already approved in the previous meeting, the three committee members' relevant suggestions were resolved to be reviewed by a committee formed by Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Huang Yuanbin, Shi Kuiling, Liu Zhendong, Pan Xulun, and Lou Tong.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the coal issue, the three committee members Liu, Huang, and Shi made several suggestions in their report, such as transportation and railway repairs, which were resolved to be handed over to the transportation authorities for research. Furthermore, regarding the appearance of black coal in Shanghai, it was resolved to be strictly investigated and dealt with by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Government. As for the coal price, the Ministry of Economic Affairs proposed raising prices by 40% to maintain coal mine production, which was approved at the meeting.</p>
<p>(C) The three committee members Liu, Huang, and Shi also raised several difficult issues regarding the grain issue in their report, which were resolved to be handed over to the Ministry of Food for research.</p>
<p>(D) Several suggestions on finance and foreign exchange were handed over to the Fiscal Equalization Fund Committee for consideration. In addition, opinions on price control were to be compiled by the Secretariat of the Economic Commission and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>(2) The proposal to adopt a stock issuance method for the sale of state-owned enterprises and to organize a banking syndicate for fundraising was approved in principle. It was resolved to appoint eight committee members: Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Hongjun, Pan Xulun, Weng Wenhao, Xu Kan, and Huang Yuanbin, for review.</p>
<h3>National Banks to Strictly Supervise</h3>
<p>The Auditing Department of the Central Bank investigated the number of bounced checks at the city's check clearing house, which had recently surged, reaching over 100,000, more than doubling the previous amount. The reason for this is that same-day checks can still be reused on the same day, leading to credit inflation and increased bounced checks. In addition, it was found that depositors were overdrawing their accounts without authorization after signing contracts with banks. If the bank's funds were insufficient, the overdraft checks would be bounced. Recently, it was also discovered that checks issued by depositors with sufficient funds were also being bounced. According to banking law, if a bank bounces a check for a depositor with sufficient funds, the bank should be liable for compensation, but currently, the bank only apologizes the next day. All these situations are sufficient to increase credit currency and disrupt the market. Therefore, the Central Bank has decided to further tighten control over the non-reuse of same-day checks. Banks must not bounce customer's cashier's checks under any circumstances. If a cashier's check is bounced, it will be treated as a sign of potential bankruptcy. After same-day checks are disallowed, bounced checks are expected to be reduced to zero.</p>
<p>National Bank Raises Interest Rates on Interbank Term Deposits and Changes the Unit to 100 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Report] To encourage commercial banks to absorb social idle funds, the Central Bank introduced a type of interbank term deposit, with a unit of 500 million yuan, for a term of 10 days, with a monthly interest rate of 5%. Since its implementation, it is said that commercial banks have deposited a lot. However, recently, due to the increase in market interest rates, the Bankers Association requested an increase in deposit interest rates. The fixed amount of 500 million yuan was also considered inconvenient for banks with smaller deposits. It is now known that the National Bank has changed the unit of this deposit to 100 million yuan from October 25th, and the monthly interest rate has been increased to 8%. The authorities are planning to reorganize</p>
<p>Authorities Plan to Reorganize Northeast Circulation Certificates, New Taiwan Dollar to Remain Temporarily Unchanged</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] According to the Joint Credit Information Center, reliable sources have learned that the authorities plan to reorganize the current circulation certificates in the Northeast at an appropriate time and convert them into national currency. However, the reorganization of the New Taiwan Dollar is still pending because prices in Taiwan are stable and the province has abundant products. In terms of regional economy, whether it is internal trade or international trade, its trade status is in surplus. Therefore, the authorities are reluctant to make changes hastily to avoid affecting the province's current good economic situation.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Both Weak</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for unified public bonds saw slight declines across the board. Large investors still had the tendency to push prices up to release their holdings, causing prices to retreat sharply after rising. Unified Class C bonds rose from 23,700 yuan to 24,500 yuan, but soon retreated to 20,900 yuan, and closed at 21,400 yuan at noon. This was a decrease of 1,600 yuan compared to the previous day. Class A and B bonds fell by 1,200 yuan, Class D bonds fell by slightly less than 1,300 yuan, and Class E bonds fell by 900 yuan. The total trading volume was about 6.7 million yuan.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market saw a slight rebound. While foreign firms were buying, securities firms were selling. Jardine Matheson saw a particularly strong decline. Ewo fell from 1,970,000 yuan to 1,900,000 yuan, and closed at 1,950,000 yuan at noon, a decrease of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous close. British American Tobacco fell by 9,000 yuan, Mengguang fell by 5,000 yuan, China Navigation, paper companies, and the brewery saw slight declines. Jardine Matheson fell by more than half a percentage point. Telephone traded between 115,000 yuan and 120,000 yuan, while Zhide traded between 35,000 yuan and 38,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest of Expired British and American Gold Bonds Transferred to the National Treasury Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is learned that the 17th principal and 17th interest payment for the 27th year British Gold Bonds, the 17th principal and 17th interest payment for the 27th year American Gold Bonds, the 17th interest payment for the 27th year Customs Gold Bonds, the first tranche of bonds and the 11th principal and 15th interest payment for the 29th year Construction American Gold Bonds, the first tranche of bonds and the 11th principal and 15th interest payment for the 29th year Construction British Gold Bonds, the 17th principal and 17th interest payment for the 27th year National Defense Bonds, and the 8th principal and 11th interest payment for the 31st year Allied Victory American Gold Bonds reserve funds have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and transferred to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, and will be paid out as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares Trading Listless</h3>
<p>The news of loan-seeking yesterday for the 52nd forward delivery of Hua Shares affected market sentiment, with retail investors mostly considering selling their current holdings. Due to few new buyers for the forward delivery, a state of weakness was evident at times. Interest rates gradually declined. Although Guangbang banks were absorbing spot holdings, they were ultimately unable to reverse the downward trend, and the forward market closed at a low price, making the market quite clear. However, arbitrage trading was still considerable. In the afternoon, due to the bottom support, which had been squeezed out in the morning, the current delivery was connected, and also came to an end in the forward market, slightly invigorating market sentiment, and prices mostly recovered. Mid-way, news came out that the government was short by 100 billion yuan, further stimulating buying. Moreover, it was learned that the National Economic Commission would convene a meeting in the capital, which generally raised hopes. Therefore, prices closed high at the end, with fluctuations being rare and the foundation remaining stable.</p>
<h3>Brokers Request Discretionary Reduction of Margin</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's stock exchange held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4 pm yesterday. After discussing the case of the Brokers Association's request to reduce the margin for forward delivery, it was generally believed that the brokers' statements were true, and it was decided to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Sales Sluggish, Oil Prices Fluctuated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the north and south markets together received over 12,500 piculs of rice. The early market was tight for a time, but ended up softening due to sluggish sales. In the end, japonica and indica rice were both high-priced but sluggish, while white yuan and yin yuan were flat. Flour prices fell sharply in the early market. In the afternoon, due to high prices in Wuxi, they recovered by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bean cake prices were stable.</p>
<p>Both supply and demand for soybean cake were scarce. Soybean prices fell in the early market, but then recovered because local merchants were purchasing and oil factories were inquiring, resulting in a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. For Nanyang, bean traders still preferred high-quality materials. Guangbang merchants were actively searching for red beans. Although the arrival of new red beans was strong, prices still rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Cowpeas saw a decline in Shantou sales, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sorghum distilleries were busy with sales, pushing prices up by 10,000 yuan. Maize saw slight movement from northern merchants, raising prices slightly. Sesame saw brisk sales locally, recovering by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Oil factories also entered the market, causing the market to become firm. Raw peanuts were firm both officially and unofficially.</p>
<p>Oil market prices fluctuated. Soybean oil sales were brisk, recovering by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Raw oil was sluggish. Raw oil from Jiangbei arrived in Shanghai, falling by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Clear oil, sesame oil, and rapeseed oil saw little activity.</p>
<p>More Than 30 Cases of Applications for Returning Goods Imported with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the issuance of the notice last week by the Import Control Committee regarding the application for and supplementary registration of goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, importers have already started going through the procedures. As of now, there have been over 30 applications for returning goods for export. Most importers are still waiting for the government's announcement of the purchase and sale methods. Therefore, applicants for purchase are still waiting to see. In addition, the Import Control Committee has not yet notified customs to release merchants applying for returning the original goods. The committee is currently compiling the received applications for return and will notify customs for release upon completion.</p>
<h3>No Such Decision by the Import Control Committee for Relaxation of Quotas in South China</h3>
<p>Also, according to a news report that quotas for imports to South China are about to be relaxed and that imports with self-provided foreign exchange may be allowed, Chief Secretary Fang Yunxian of the Secretariat of the Import Control Committee stated that he had heard nothing of this. The committee currently has no such decision, and there have been no reports from South China either. He believes it is the opinion and hope of the general public. Furthermore, Director Shen Zouting of the Quota Allocation Division stated that the relaxation of quotas for South China and the permission of imports with self-provided foreign exchange should be uniformly stipulated by the committee. If the quotas for South China should be relaxed, the number should be increased from within the seasonal quota. President Zhang previously doubled the quotas for South China during his trip to Hui, and the committee has not yet made a decision on how it should be in the future. As for self-provided foreign exchange, it is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. Shen's expression regarding the relaxation of quotas for the fourth quarter is based on the transfer of foreign exchange income. If foreign exchange increases, relaxing quotas will not be a problem. Currently, all industries are requesting increases.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus of the clearing house had a difference of 17.6 billion yuan. Unofficial interest was 20%, and the securities discount rate remained at 19.5% to 24%.</p>
<p>The overall rationing of edible oil, originally scheduled to begin on the first of next month, is a joint allocation by the China Trust Bureau, China Plants, and the Three Refining Oil Industry Association, totaling 36,000 dan. It will be sold at the allocated price to the Shanghai Municipal Food Distribution Committee for distribution. Due to the outstanding funding issues during the delivery, distribution is difficult to carry out as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Draft Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>— (Continued and Completed)</p>
<p>Article 56 The registration office must not refuse the request in the preceding paragraph without justifiable reasons.

<h3>Women, Infants, and Tetanus</h3>
<p>— Yang Yuanji</p>
<p>The relationship between women and infants and diseases is more closely related than that of the average person, and tetanus is no exception. Therefore, the saying "Only women and petty men are difficult to raise" can also be interpreted in this way. What exactly is tetanus? To understand the terrible nature of tetanus, one must first understand its extraordinary personality and vitality.</p>
<p>It is a rod-shaped bacterium about 2-3 microns long with dozens of flagella that enable it to move. It can live in any environment as long as it is devoid of oxygen. It thrives best at a temperature of around 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has strong resistance. Simple steaming for less than five minutes or high heat above 80 degrees for less than an hour is not enough to kill it. It can withstand adverse conditions in carbolic acid for fifteen minutes and struggle for three hours in a 1% mercuric chloride solution. It can even withstand direct sunlight for a considerable period.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very tall, wouldn't you agree? It can survive in the soil for three and a half years and can be passed down for sixteen months in the concentrate of a horse's body. When transplanted onto dry wood chips, their history can extend for years.</p>
<p>The element that creates this tenacious personality is its innate toxicity. This severe toxicity is what makes it extraordinary and makes it a great enemy of mankind. It uses this externally produced weapon to attack in two ways: one binds to nerve center cells, causing spasms (called tetanus toxin Tetanospasmin); and the other dissolves red blood cells, causing poisoning (called tetanus hemolysin Tetanolysin). Therefore, its toxins occupy the highest position among bacterial toxins: only 0.00002 grams of toxin can kill a white mouse weighing 10 cm. Animals, especially horses, are most susceptible to it, almost as if they have encountered a fierce god.</p>
<p>However, if human tissues are healthy and without wounds, then tetanus bacteria smeared on the skin cannot exert their power and have no opportunity to release toxins.</p>
<p>Therefore, for it to interact with humans, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<p>1. There is a wound on the skin or mucous membrane.</p>
<p>2. In addition to tetanus bacteria, foreign objects (such as wood chips) or other bacteria are mixed into the wound.</p>
<p>3. The environment of the wound site should be dirty, poorly ventilated, and frequently visited by humans and animals.</p>
<p>There are two views regarding its entry path:</p>
<p>1. One view is that it invades through the lymphatic system. It progresses centripetally from the peripheral lymphatic spaces around local nerves to the motor nerve center cells, where they combine.</p>
<p>2. Another view is that the toxin travels from the blood vessel-lymphatic system at the point of entry to the nerve endings and then along the axons to the center, where it combines with the motor nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>Now let's describe the terrible face that tetanus presents to humanity:</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a hideous expression that is neither a sneer nor a bitter smile? This is the unique tetanus facies (Facies Tetanica). Its unique smile is called sardonic grin (Risus Sardonicus). Let me analyze it in detail, and it will not be difficult for you to imagine: The occurrence of this expression begins with rigidity of the masticatory muscles—the chewing movement is hindered, and the jaw is clenched shut (Trismus), making it impossible to eat. Secondly, the facial muscles tense up, causing wrinkles on the forehead, the mouth to slant outwards, the teeth to be exposed, and the labial folds to be indented (Nasolabialfalte). Thirdly, the neck muscles become rigid, the back muscles tense, and the abdominal muscles tense, forming opisthotonos and a board-like abdomen. When the intercostal muscles also tense, the chest cavity is fixed in an inspiratory state, and all respiratory movement relies solely on the diaphragm.</p>
<p>The most painful thing is that the patient has not lost consciousness and is very clear-headed. Because of the hyperactivity of reflexes, even the slightest stimuli, such as a small amount of light or sound, can trigger recurrent spasms, not to mention coughing or swallowing. The patient cries out in pain, with tears in their eyes, in a state of misery that is unbearable to witness. Near death, the temperature can exceed 43 degrees Celsius, so-called hyperpyrexia, probably due to paralysis of the regulating center.</p>
<p>Patients may die lightning-fast in three or four days, or paralytically in one or two weeks. Those who can survive for five or six weeks are more likely to recover. The shorter the incubation period, the worse the outcome.</p>
<p>From this, it is obvious that tetanus bacteria easily come into contact with women and infants. Because:</p>
<p>1. When a baby is born, the umbilical cord must be cut, which inevitably creates a wound. If the instrument used to cut the umbilical cord is unclean or the binding tape is dirty and not disinfected, then lockjaw can occur, known as the "seven-day wind." That is, what is medically called neonatal tetanus (Tetanus Traumaticiano).</p>
<p>2. During childbirth, the genital area of the mother will be injured to a greater or lesser extent. Strict disinfection during delivery and clean treatment during the puerperium are essential to avoid bacterial infection. Otherwise, the disaster of uncleanness can cause infinite harm. Those who take advantage of the opportunity to enter are not only tetanus bacteria.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to prevent bacterial infection and to prevent tetanus from easily depriving life, absolute disinfection of the parturient woman and absolute attention to disinfection of the umbilical cord are iron rules that cannot be neglected. Violating the rules undoubtedly indirectly leads to the great mistake of negligent homicide.</p>
<p>Although there is also serum therapy for tetanus, it is not as miraculous and rapid as diphtheria serum because tetanus toxin binds to nerve bacteria more quickly and firmly than diphtheria toxin binds to tissue cells. Furthermore, treatment with serum injection is mostly ineffective after spasms have occurred. The earlier the injection, the better. The dosage for subcutaneous and intravenous use should be large, with antitoxin reaching 40,000 to 50,000 units. The dosage for intrathecal injection into the spinal cord can be small, about 200 to 300 units, and can be very effective. Of course, wound cleaning, disinfection, astringency, and magnesium sulfate (20%) injection are all symptomatic treatments in the treatment and are essential effective measures.</p>
<p>Although the results of tetanus serum are not as significant as those of diphtheria, it has been able to reduce the mortality rate from 80-90% to 40-50%, which is not considered a poor effect.</p>
<p>If we review the records of ancient medicine, there is also much evidence for reference:</p>
<p>For example, in "General Treatise on the Etiology and Symptomatology of Various Diseases" by Chao Yuanfang of the Sui Dynasty, there are six types of "postpartum stroke and spasm": "The symptoms are mouth stiffness, opisthotonos, shaking head, horse neighing, waist bent backward, occurring ten times in an instant, shortness of breath as if dying, sweating like rain, those who are not wiped in time will die."</p>
<p>And as he describes infantile lockjaw, he says:</p>
<p>"One day of lockjaw, two days of trismus, three days of wind-induced death, are all urgent illnesses; but look at the red face, shortness of breath, and inability to cry, the prognosis is already critical and dangerous."</p>
<p>Then it can be known that tetanus, as a disease, was regarded as a hopeless and severe terminal illness as early as thousands of years ago.</p>
<h3>Nutritional Disorders in Breastfed Infants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Nutritional Therapy for Indigestion</p>
<p>The necessity of nutritional therapy can be understood by observing that changing the diet alone can achieve therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Human Milk Nutritional Therapy: Generally, the younger the breastfed infant, the more necessary human milk nutrition becomes. However, even for older breastfed children, human milk is the most superior nutritional therapy. When administering human milk, there is no need to specify the exact quantity; it is sufficient to limit the duration and frequency of breastfeeding.</p>
<p>After starting human milk nutrition, there is no immediate increase in body weight; instead, there is a decrease in body weight for the first two to four days. Then, the symptoms ease, the appearance improves, and body weight increases.</p>
<p>Artificial Nutritional Therapy: Begin with starvation therapy for the first six to twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Starvation Therapy</p>
<p>Not necessarily absolute starvation; harmless substances like a small amount of dextrose crystals (approximately 0.05%) in roasted tea decoction can be added, given in amounts of 20 to 30 cubic centimeters per day, every two hours. As a result of this method, the infant becomes calm, sleeps well, and the frequency of diarrhea decreases. However, this therapy is very dangerous for those who are severely depleted or only two or three weeks old, as it can lead to a decline in endurance that is difficult to recover. Therefore, it is advisable not to use it.</p>
<p>From the second day of therapy, administer skim milk or unsweetened buttermilk, or milk supplemented with oatmeal juice (use fortified milk for growing infants). The quantity should not exceed 200 cubic centimeters for the entire day on the second day, with a maximum of 40 cubic centimeters per feeding, five times a day. Additionally, use sweetened roasted tea to meet fluid requirements. Afterward, adjust the dosage based on the overall condition and stool characteristics, gradually increasing the amount as a guideline. For example: On the second day of therapy, fortified milk is given at a rate of cubic centimeters per feeding.</p>
<p>Five times a day. On the third day of therapy, fortified milk is given at a rate of 50 cubic centimeters per feeding. On the fourth day of therapy, fortified milk is given at a rate of 60 cubic centimeters per feeding.</p>
<p>The dosage can be gradually increased in this way, transitioning to a diet concentration and quantity appropriate for the age. Also, when first using skim milk, one can gradually transition to whole milk, considering the symptoms. For example, initially use a milk mixture with equal parts whole milk and skim milk to reduce fat, then halve the skim milk content.</p>
<p>The increase in body weight is based on carbohydrates, so attention must be paid when adding them to the milk. (The End)</p>
<h3>An Incident of Unexpected Complications Arising from Neck Surgery Using Anesthesia</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Two cases of death due to anesthesia have occurred this year in Beijing and Shanghai. Among them, the case of Dr. Guo Zhide of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital, who performed a local anesthesia to remove a wart on the buttocks of Ke Weiyao, has been acquitted by the court. However, the case of Dr. Qian Mingxi of Nanjing Municipal Hospital, who used spinal anesthesia for Diao Rongtai to treat appendicitis, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to one and a half years in prison. The Qian case is very similar to the Guo case. From a scientific point of view, the Qian case should have been acquitted. However, in this chaotic world, Chinese scientists are worthless, let alone discarded teachers who ponder issues. One can only rely on one's fate. The Qian case has been appealed, and I do not know the outcome. Recently, I read about an incident involving the use of anesthesia with unexpected complications in the Swiss Medical Gazette, Volume 77, Issue 33, published on August 16th of this year, which is very similar to the Qian case. If the judge adopts the materials presented and reverses the verdict, it would be fortunate not only for Dr. Qian Mingxi, but also for the entire Western medical community in our country.</p>
<p>(Note: This incident occurred around August 1946. The attending physician was Dr. L. Ruedi, Director of the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department and University Professor at the University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. The patient suffered from pharyngeal cellulitis. After intravenous injection of the general anesthetic (Narconumal), respiratory arrest occurred immediately. Although various emergency measures were taken to revive the patient and the original condition was treated surgically, the patient remained unconscious and died the next day. An immediate autopsy was performed to determine the cause of death. The course of events was described by Dr. K. Graf. He detailed the advantages and disadvantages of using general or local anesthesia for surgery on the neck or throat, as well as the opinions of various surgical experts from different countries on this type of anesthesia for the aforementioned conditions (some opposed, others favored). Dr. Graf also detailed the various advantages of intravenously injected general anesthetics such as Narconumal, as well as the rare occurrence of side effects. Due to the length of the article, it is not included here. Only excerpts of the surgical procedure, the autopsy findings, and the inspection results are reported.)</p>
<p>The patient was a 27-year-old businessman. Four days prior, he suddenly felt pain and difficulty swallowing food on both sides of his throat. He then noticed severe pain near the thyroid gland on the left side, which worsened when swallowing. Three days later, his temperature fluctuated between 38 and 39 degrees Celsius. The doctor suspected a retro-pharyngeal abscess and advised him to stay in the hospital for consultation. His examination report on August 7, 1946, was as follows: "The patient is severely ill, frequently complaining of intense pain when swallowing. Temperature is 38.4 degrees. The neck is swollen. The left side of the neck is particularly red and swollen. Pressing on the left side of the neck causes severe pain. There appears to be a hard and distinct swelling, which is easily distinguishable. The mass formed by the thyroid gland is very painful to the touch. The jugular veins on both sides of the neck are also painful and swollen, but there is no pitting when pressed. The right side of the neck also exhibits similar symptoms, but not as severe. At this time, the patient's jaws are not stiff. The tongue is normal. The tonsils are of medium size and show no signs of inflammation. The back of the throat is normal, but the bands on both sides of the throat are slightly swollen. The trachea is normal. The clinical diagnosis is difficult to determine between thyroiditis, septic tonsillitis, and retro-pharyngeal cellulitis. The treatment method is Elcosin 6gm, Penicillin, and 500 cc of physiological saline injection.</p>
<p>On August 8th, the condition remained the same. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 37 to 66. White blood cell count was 9,600. White blood cell classification showed septic left shift. Temperature was 39.6 degrees. Fearing the entry of toxins into the jugular vein causing thrombosis, Professor Ruedi performed ligation of the jugular vein under local anesthesia. The surgery confirmed the presence of thrombus. However, ligation of the jugular vein not only did not alleviate the condition but also seemed to lead to further spread of the infection. At this time, the temperature fluctuated between 38 and 39 degrees. On August 10th of the same year, the examination was repeated, and the symptoms remained the same, but the head was more swollen, from the soft palate to the trachea. The back of the throat and the bands on both sides were also swollen, feeling like cotton. Although the trachea remained normal, both sides were swollen and narrowed. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Before the Exhibition of Professor Huang Junbi’s Paintings</h3>
<p>— Zhang Daofan</p>
<p>In the winter of the twenty-fourth year [of the Republic], I was introduced by Brother Liang Hancao and got to know the painter Huang Junbi in Nanjing. We had a very pleasant conversation about art, and it has been more than ten years since then. I know that Mr. Junbi is deeply devoted to art. He received kind instruction from his mother since childhood and worked hard at painting. When he grew up, he studied under Mr. Li Yaoping, excelling with his natural talent and surpassing his teacher. In his prime, he took promoting art as his mission and founded the Chinese Painting Research Association in Guangzhou. Mr. Junbi contributed greatly to the flourishing of the Lingnan painting style. Before the war, he served as a painting instructor at vocational schools. He once traveled to the East to study art on government orders, broadening his knowledge. His paintings are exquisite in all subjects, including figures and flowers and birds, especially landscapes, drawing from numerous masters and creating his unique style. The ancient pines are strong, the waterfalls are rapid, the clouds and smoke appear and disappear, and the artistic expression is vivid. Connoisseurs call them the three wonders of the Huang school of landscape painting. Mr. Junbi has dedicated decades to painting. His collection is very rich, and his skills are profound. He not only deeply studies the ancient masters, but also learns from nature and creates new ideas. He has visited almost all the famous mountains and rivers in China, including the Five Mountains, Mount Huang, Yan Rock, Mount Emei, Jianmen, Qingcheng, and the Three Gorges. Therefore, his works can use the brush and ink of his predecessors to depict the themes of nature, and his achievements are due to this. Mr. Junbi taught at the Art Department of Central University during the war in Sichuan, and students followed him enthusiastically. He wrote "One Hundred Views of the Jialing River," which was comparable to the works of his predecessors, and the art world praised it. Collectors both inside and outside the country treasure his paintings more than precious jade. His unique style has long been famous in the world, and there is no need for further explanation. Now, in his spare time from teaching, he has created a collection of works and has been invited by friends in Shanghai to exhibit them at the Chinese Painting Garden on Chengdu Road from October 31st to November 5th. Viewers who see so many of his carefully crafted works can verify that my words are not false and are not merely flattering him!</p>
<h3>Night Walk</h3>
<p>— Qinling</p>
<p>The waning crescent moon faintly illuminates the alley, and the wind lightly and quickly slips along the riverbank, one gust following another. The clusters of green plants growing on the short walls of houses by the water are hazy and pale green. The casually hanging branches are rubbed against the wall by the wind, making rustling sounds.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps drags out shadows. I walk alone by the river at night, feeling a sense of warmth and loneliness. I am too familiar with this place. From childhood to adulthood, every day, in sunshine, in wind and snow, I carried my schoolbag and passed by here, without interruption, without stopping. I can name the owner of each wall, what kind of ripe fruit is in the garden behind each wall, and I clearly remember the location of the small trees by the river. The river sings its poems affectionately all day long, and the light wind whistles. Years have passed, leaving traces on me, and I pass them on to the alley.</p>
<p>For the sake of life, I have been away from my hometown for many years. Tonight, I revisit the old place, and every wall and every tree has changed its face. The original walls have collapsed, and new walls have been built. The owners have also changed. The sparse small trees have grown into dense and vigorous forms. The ancient trees that have shed their leaves sigh in the night wind like aging old people. Everything has changed, but every pebble and every green leaf here still has a sense of intimacy to me. We have lived together! For years, leaving the alley, leaving home, I ventured into a strange and distant environment, experiencing loneliness and hardship. But returning to the alley today, I am afraid that I, like the alley, can only say "You have become haggard!"</p>
<p>Passing through the alley is the avenue of the Confucius Temple. There are no pedestrians on the road. The red walls of the school palace glow dimly in the moonlight. From the tall ancient trees comes the sound of birds chirping. The stone railings along the river cast oblique shadows. The arch bridge sleeps quietly above the flowing water. The archways above, with the characters I used to count carefully, stand tall in the darkness. There is a heavy sense of loneliness here, but it has become an excellent harmony for my recently troubled mood.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a vast field of grass unfolds. Corn and sunflowers are densely crowded together. Autumn insects and the sound of gnawing echo up and down. The wind rolls over the leaves, from this end of the grass field to the other. This scene makes me miss many of my childhood playmates. At that time, we all caught grasshoppers, picked fresh corn, pulled down corn husks to make whistles, caught fireflies among the ferns, took off our shoes and ran down to the washing stones, soaking our feet in the water... But those childhood friends, now some have died, and the living are separated and out of contact with each other. Based on some news that has been passed on, I only know whose situation is worse. In this day and age, emotions, hopes, and colorful dreams have all been crushed to pieces. In order to live, in order to put on a smiling face, we struggle with fatigue and hardship. The past is a dream, beautiful and wild, exquisite and lively, but everything is irretrievable.</p>
<p>In the distance, the sound of night watchmen's clappers come in waves. The time is approaching midnight. There is light thunder in the sky. The slightly rough wind dilutes the moonlight. Suddenly, my pace slows down, and I feel endless fatigue and sadness. It seems that someone is whispering in my ear:</p>
<p>"Now, just living is a luxury."</p>
<h3>Grapes</h3>
<p>— Xiyuan</p>
<p>——A Note from Listening to the Autumn Pavilion</p>
<p>As time passes, autumn is coming to an end. Melons are already a thing of the past, and various fresh fruits are coming into season.</p>
<p>Among all the fresh fruits, I find grapes more lovable than others. Mengyang's grape poem says: "When the west wind passes over the wild geese for thousands of miles, the shadows of green clouds and dark jade are uneven. Try to chew a mouthful of ice balls, and don't say that there are lychees in the south of the sky." In fact, it doesn't have to be after drinking. At any time, pick up a bunch of grapes and send them into your mouth one by one. The sweet and delicious taste makes people feel happy.</p>
<p>If we explore the origin of grapes, it is the same as watermelons. They were imported from the Western Regions. The History of the Han Dynasty: The Biography of the Kingdom of Dayuan records: "Dayuan uses grapes to make wine, and the rich store wine up to tens of thousands of stones. Those who have been around for decades will not fail. The Han envoy collected grapes and alfalfa and brought them back to plant. The emperor used many heavenly horses, and foreign envoys came in crowds, so he planted grapes beside the palaces, which was very prosperous." Li Qi's poem says: "The bones of war are buried in the wilderness year after year, and grapes are only seen entering the Han family." But now people only know how to enjoy it, who knows the origin of this mere grape!</p>
<p>There are many kinds of grapes, and Fang Zhi recorded them in detail; Crystal grapes, the color is white like powder, the shape is large and long, and the taste is very sweet, especially the Western ones. As for milk grapes, the color is purple, the shape is large and long, and the taste is sweet. Purple grapes, black, there are two kinds of large and small, sweet and sour. Green grapes, from Sichuan, are green when ripe, like Western grapes, named Shining Eyes, which tastes better than sugar and honey, and seedless, which is Wu Pin."</p>
<p>What is related to grapes is wine. Su Zi's poem says: "Grapes can't stand the winter, and they curl up as if they have no breath. In spring, they take advantage of the prosperous sun, and the shelves are covered with green silk quilts. Dragons are messy and countless, and the nipples hang to the ground. At first, they are like early plums, and later they taste like thick cheese. Who can make wine for you? I'll get drunk in front of the shelf for you." Liu Yuxi's poem says: "It becomes a beautiful wine, which makes people not enough to drink. I will hold a bucket for you and go to Liangzhou to collect it." Wang Han's Liangzhou song: is even more well-known.</p>
<p>There are many texts in our country that praise grapes. In Emperor Wei Wen's edict, there is a passage about grapes. He said: "There are many precious fruits in China, let's talk about grapes, when they are in late summer and early autumn, there is still a surplus of heat, drunken and sober from wine, after the dew and eat, sweet but not sweet, crispy but not sour, cold but not cold, long taste and juicy, eliminate troubles and quench thirst, and they can be used as wine, sweeter than rice cakes, It is already drooling, let alone eating it in person? Other fruits, can there be a match?" This shows Cao Pi's special appreciation for grapes, but he can be called a confidant of grapes.</p>
<p>"What kind of news, Mr. Wu?" Qiang spoke before me; as she spoke, she directed Little Tiger to pour tea for Yuanyuan.</p>
<p>"Isn't it just about the Japanese devils attacking Nankou!" Yuanyuan gathered the clothes and parts he had taken off into a pile, threw them on the grass pile in the corner of the room: "They originally planned to attack at dawn tomorrow; I don't know how it came about, but now I hear that it has been changed to a midnight sneak attack - it will start at twelve o'clock tonight. With this change, there is nothing else, but..."</p>
<p>"But!..." Yaoqun said these two words at the same time, and then stopped immediately, meaning to let Dingyuan continue. But Dingyuan, seeing that Yaoqun had taken over, slowly walked towards the grass pile in the corner, propped his hand on the grass pile, and sat down rustlingly, took the cup of tea that Little Tiger had poured for him, and apologized to Yuanyuan, meaning to let Yaoqun express her opinion. Dingyuan's English gentlemanly attitude probably only retained some of these.</p>
<p>"But... it seems to be in conflict with our planned plan, isn't it?" Yaoqun looked at Dingyuan and said the sentence she wanted to say.</p>
<p>"Isn't it? I was thinking the same thing." Dingyuan expressed the opinion he was just about to express.</p>
<p>We people listened to the dialogue between Yaoqun and Dingyuan, and they didn't seem to understand the meaning; the big fool "04" only opened his big eyes, showing his brilliance and mystery; Little Tiger also stared wide-eyed. She looked at Yuanyuan and Dingyuan. As for me, of course, I was even more confused.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Yue!" Yaoqun smiled apologetically at me: "Just now, because I mentioned the past, I rambled on and on, and forgot to tell you the important things to do tonight. We came here to plan to leave Changping together tonight, or at the latest tomorrow morning. Before we leave, we plan to give the Japanese spy headquarters here a fierce blow, at least to smash it to pieces..."</p>
<p>"Oh?" I was a little surprised to hear Yaoqun's plan.</p>
<p>"Yes," Yaoqun nodded very decisively to me: "Our steps are like this; first I and Brother Tiger run to the front line of the devils, the left wing, and send out a signal. The National Army guarding Nankou has already communicated with us in advance, and as soon as they get this signal, they will start the night attack; the entire front line will be launched together. Although they don't necessarily have to rush into the line of the Japanese devils, they are also prepared to give the devils a major blow!..."</p>
<p>"Signal?..." "Night attack?..." I didn't mean to interrupt Yaoqun's words, just repeating the words of the few people on Yaoqun's lips.</p>
<h3>That Sincere Maid</h3>
<p>— Baudelaire, Translated by Dai Wangshu</p>
<p>That sincere maid, whom you envied in those years, now she sleeps beneath the humble grass, we should also bring a few flowers to offer. The dead, the poor dead, all have great suffering; when October, the tree feller, blows its mournful wind, whirling around their tombstones, they must feel that the living are truly heartless, sleeping so peacefully, warmly embracing the cotton quilt, while they are tormented by dark dreams, with no one to share their pillow, nor to make jokes, old bones freezing, gnawed by insects to the marrow, they feel the winter snow seeping dry, feel the centuries passing, and no friend or home to replace the withered flowers hanging on their grates. If, when the hearth sings its songs, I see her sitting in the armchair, at ease, if, in the blue cold night of December, I find her curled up in a corner of the room, her expression solemn, coming from her eternal bed, watching with loving eyes the children she raised; seeing her sunken eyes overflowing with tears, how shall I answer this devout soul?</p>
<h3>The Rebirth of National Art</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>— Reading Professor Huang Junbi's Chinese Paintings</p>
<p>The achievement of a generation of literary and artistic scholarship is the accumulation of thousands of years of historical culture. Only with a profound and long-standing cultural origin can there be a radiant and outstanding generation of art. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "The sincere is incessant, incessant therefore enduring, enduring therefore subtle, subtle therefore far-reaching, far-reaching therefore broad and deep, broad and deep therefore brilliant and luminous." This statement accurately explains the continuous and brilliant phenomenon of our national culture. Sincerity is the supreme treasure of our national spirit and a basic condition for those engaged in general literary and artistic scholarship. Its achievements cannot be separated from national origins and cultural traditions, which is even more difficult to deny.</p>
<p>Professor Huang Junbi of Central University inherited his family learning since childhood, studied under famous teachers, viewed famous paintings, and worked tirelessly; he studied the great masters of the Song Dynasty, the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying of the Ming Dynasty, the Two Shi of the Qing Dynasty, and Xin Luo, extensively. Before the war, he traveled east to study art. After returning to China, he roamed the famous scenic spots in China, such as Luofu, Yangshuo, Huangshan, and Yandang, and lingered to sketch on each trip. During the war, he went up the Yangtze River to the west, climbed Mount Emei three times, and exited Jianmen twice. His "One Hundred Views of the Jialing River" not only directly approached his predecessors but also created a unique style.</p>
<p>I once heard Mr. Junbi discuss painting, advocating that beginners must distinguish the sources of various schools before tracing back to the Tang and Song dynasties; after achieving academic success, they should learn from nature and create their own styles. The so-called "drawing inspiration from the ancients and using nature as a teacher" is close to this.</p>
<p>Mr. Junbi has been teaching at Central University for nearly ten years. Students follow him enthusiastically, and the art world respects him. Recently, he brought his works to Shanghai for exhibition. I had the honor to view his works "Emerald Mountains", "Sail Shadows at Jianmen", "Guanyin at Yan Rock", "Summer Retreat in the Bamboo Forest", "Flying Waterfall at Gaokang Rock", and "Seeking Appreciation with Qin". The brushwork is vigorous, the coloring is profound, the composition is novel and elegant, mostly between the Song and Yuan people; and the clouds, smoke, water, light, lush and flowing, every grass and tree are full of life, and he can deeply grasp the essence of sketching. This is someone who is not only immersed in the national cultural tradition but also able to independently create with a sincere spirit.</p>
<p>After the crowd dispersed, I admired Mr. Junbi's skills and felt the rebirth of Chinese national art. I deeply believe that the source of rebirth cannot be separated from the inheritance of cultural traditions, and even more so relies on the development of a creative spirit. I will briefly express my feelings to seek advice from those who are wiser.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Library (Part 1)</h3>
<p>The library was established in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic [1936], and its original site was in the former city center of Jiangwan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was completely looted by the enemy. After the victory, it was ordered to reopen in September of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic [1945] and took over the former Shanghai Municipal Council Library on Fuzhou Road and the former Municipal Library of the Nanshi Cultural Center. It officially reopened on October 1st of the same year at the original site of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Library on Fuzhou Road, opening for reading.</p>
<p>Borrowing Rules: Any resident of this city who holds a library card is entitled to borrowing privileges. To obtain a library card, you must first obtain an application form, fill it out truthfully, and obtain a guarantor for verification. Borrowing hours are from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>Reading Rules: All residents of this city have the right to freely read all books and periodicals and all cultural records in the library. Before entering, you must first obtain a reading card and return it to the signing desk when leaving the library. Opening hours are from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM daily, and it is open as usual on Sundays and holidays.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank's Issuing Bureau Replied: The 2,000 Yuan Note Printed by Waterlow &amp; Sons, England, is Not a Counterfeit; the Front is Cyan and the Back is Light Red</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from reader Zhang Xiaozu of Xidun South Street: There is a type of legal tender, with a light red back and a cyan front, with a face value of 2,000 yuan, which does not have the seals of the President and Vice President of the Central Bank. Some shops accept it, while others refuse it, and the people are confused about its authenticity and want an answer. After inquiring with the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, we received the following reply:</p>
<p>We have received your letter and the attached letter from Zhang Xiaozu, which we have noted. The 2,000 yuan note you mentioned was printed by Waterlow &amp; Sons in England. Because the back of the note already has the signature of the bank's president, the front does not have the official seals of the president and vice president of the bank. This type of note has been issued before. We are replying accordingly, hoping that you can explain this to the public. Sincerely, Shanghai Shen Bao Social Services Department, Central Bank Issuing Bureau.</p>
<h3>Brief Service Report</h3>
<p>Soliciting Sales Representatives: A certain magazine company in this city is seeking several sales representatives. Applicants must have a secondary school education, be familiar with commercial information, have good articulation, and possess demonstrable sales skills. Compensation will be determined based on job performance. Qualified individuals may send a detailed resume to Mr. Wang Decai, 1177 Liyang Road (5), and a personal interview will be arranged by letter.</p>
<p>Seeking Lost Donation Registers: Yesterday (the 28th) around 10 AM, while traveling by rickshaw from the South City to the Shen Bao newspaper office, two donation registers and one account book belonging to the Wujin Xudongmenwai Baitahongzhuang Central National School's building construction fund were lost on the rickshaw. Please notify 9324 if found, so they can be retrieved. Beware of anyone soliciting donations in the school's name. Dong Jianyi</p>
<h3>Reader's Mailbox: Divorce · Running Away · Pessimism</h3>
<p>To Ms. Shan: We received your letter and sympathize greatly with your situation. Here are our brief responses to the three points you raised:</p>
<p>"Divorce": Legally, there are two ways to divorce: one is "consensual divorce," where both spouses agree to the divorce; however, minors must obtain the consent of their legal guardians. The procedure for divorce is also simple: write a divorce agreement with the signatures of two or more witnesses. Obtaining a lawyer's attestation is even more appropriate. If there are children, the father is legally responsible for their custody, unless otherwise agreed upon. You stated, "I am a woman of twenty years old." Legally, "adulthood" is reached at twenty years old. The age commonly referred to in customary usage is often the nominal age, so please be aware of this. The other type of divorce is "divorce by judgment," where one spouse petitions the court for divorce; however, legal grounds must exist, such as "one spouse being treated by the other in a way that makes cohabitation unbearable," or "one spouse maliciously abandoning the other in a continuous state," etc. (See Article 1052 of the Civil Code). A spouse who suffers damages due to divorce by judgment may seek compensation from the negligent spouse. According to your letter, it's only "lack of affection" and "looking down on him." There do not appear to be statutory grounds to rely upon, but the longer it goes on, the deeper the estrangement will become. We believe that affection can be cultivated between people, especially between spouses!</p>
<p>"Running Away": Running away is not an honorable solution. Before a divorce, marrying or cohabitating with someone else would violate the criminal law. (See Articles 237 and 239 of the Criminal Code).</p>
<p>"Pessimism": Suicide is the most cowardly and foolish act. Destroying yourself not only doesn't solve the problem but also fails to gain sympathy from society. What's the point? Therefore, thoughts of pessimism are absolutely unacceptable! What do you think? (Editor)</p>
