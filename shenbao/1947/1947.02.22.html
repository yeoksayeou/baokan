<h3>救濟金改購棉花布疋　聯總贊成我建議　傳魯克期已飭滬分署草擬計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿日電〕我駐美大使顯維鈞，今蘇請聯總中央委員會，立即考慮對華協助之措施。權威方面悉：聯總對我國要求增加棉花及其他主要消費用品代替原計劃中耐用之工業機構之請求，尚未有何項行動。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕頃自可靠方面探悉：聯總高級人員皆堅決贊成中國之建議，以價值四千九百萬美元之棉花製成棉布，售之於公開市塲。今日聯總九國中央委員會由署長魯克斯召開非常會議時，魯氏力主以四千九百萬美元之救濟基金，收貿棉花，供給中國。又據聯總可靠方面消息：魯克斯刻已致電上海中國分署，飭其擬具詳細計劃，待於下週初接獲答覆後，再交中央委員會商議，採取行動。衆料此事雖係出於中國大使顧維鈞之呼籲，稱之爲「對於中國現狀之實際的與心理的援助」，但魯古斯將親自負此賣職。另據消息靈通人土稱：聯總本預備一千九百萬美元，用以購買醫藥用品，接濟中國，而顧維鈞大使之呼籲，則力言中國爲一農業國家，農民所急需者乃布疋，倘能應價購得此項物品，則彼等亦願以農產物廉價出售，故以棉花接濟中國乃對由國之極大幫助云。又據魯氏稱：中國當局會建議可以此項棉花接濟品百分之十救濟貧民，百分之五作爲縫製棉衣之用。又悉：聯總物資在中國及其他國家已曾加以變賣，傳款所得即移歸總署，仍充作救濟基金。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕此問預料聯總不久即可批准中國購買棉花計劃，在批准前，聯總之中央委員會靜待中國政府正式保證其所提之購買棉花計劃，確為謀中國農民福利之需要。而非中飽黑市投機者之私囊。</p>

<h3>銀樓業金飾買賣問題</h3>
<p>禁止黃金買賣投機的緊急辦法實行以來，根據幾日來的報導，各方反應尚良好。惟經濟緊急措施方案第二項：關於取締投機買賣安定金融市塲事項所附的『取締黃金投機買賣辦法』，其第一條硬性規定『禁止條塊及金飾之買賣，違者沒收充公」，致京滬銀樓業及首飾店，均陷歇業狀態。上海銀樓業公會代表連日開會請願，並向政府提出四項建議，靜待政府對銀樓業及首飾店製成金飾處理辦法之公佈。如果眞依『取締黃金投機買賣辦法』第一條之解釋，則銀樓及首飾店之金飾買賣，也是違法的。營業人如不依法受取締，停止買賣行爲，其已製成之金飾品，亦須沒收充公。果如是，則全國銀樓首飾業將於黃金浪潮下全部停歇，若干技術工人亦迫上失業的道途，爲動盪不安的社會又增一重災患了。</p>
<p>禁止黃金買賣，並防北以黃金爲投機的對象，在產金國和藏金最多的國家，早有控制的辦法。但禁民間以金爲佈物，實爲創例，世所鮮見。我國這次禁止黃金買賣和自由流通的政策，本是一種賢明的政策，惟因技術上完成於倉卒間，所以把金飾的買十貿也槪括禁止，違者同受沒收充公。不過對於銀樓業及首飾店製成金飾應有合理的處置，所以『取締黃金投機買賣貿辦法』第九條規定將另定辦法，顯然是授權財政部爲行政救濟。那末，財政部自應迅速制定是項辦法，以安人心。</p>
<p>現在根據該辦法第九條規定的銀樓業首飾店金飾處理辦法，業由財部於一昨公布。此一辦法的規定，顯有很多漏洞，值得再番考慮，其第二條規定將已製成之金飾品須列表向主管機關登記，而經登記之金飾，應於本辦法公布後三個月內出售之。其第三條又規定已登記未出售之金飾，於三月期滿後，應持向當地中央銀行兌換國幣。對於此種規定我們有不解者是：（一）三月期滿後是吾銀樓首飾業將不許繼續存在；（二）中央銀行拋售黃金的價格花二月十二二爲七三〇萬元，二月九日爲五六二萬元，二月八日爲五七二萬元，至二月十八日，在國府頒布經濟緊急措施辦法後，中央銀行復將金賈見定爲四八〇萬。七二〇萬元，五六二萬元，以及五七二萬元都是中央銀行拋售的價格，而現在要銀樓首飾以四八〇萬售與中央銀行。這一移轉豈非令銀樓首飾店蒙受重大損失？此項規定於情理方面都覺說不過去。再則銀樓首飾店如將製成金飾賣完，勢必沒有存金可製金飾；而前項辦法只有銀樓以所存金飾出售於中央銀行之規定，却沒有銀樓首飾店應如何獲取原金以製金飾的規定。此種片面的辦法，實在似欠考慮。</p>
<p>復次，就此項辦法的全面來看，此一辦法的公布似在便利手有金條約人，將他們的金條易爲金飾。假如手頭沒有金條約人，他們何能以原金製成金飾，以此而「委托」銀樓首飾店？此一辦法實行的結果不特有將使銀樓首飾業全部破產的危險，並將破壞一般人民以辛動所得的餘資來購置金飾作爲儲蓄的習尚。經此結果不特將遭致數十萬人的失業，抑將破壞民問的一種美德。、</p>
<p>舉凡一種行政措施，必然是利書參半的。政府對於受害部分，理論上應該有一種行政救濟。關於禁止銀樓業飾金買賣的問題，應該作如何的救濟呢？我們以爲上海銀樓業的四項建議：（一）銀樓製售飾品每件重量不得超過關秤二兩，並不得熔化小條出售；（二）請准予收兌飾金，其價格遵照中央銀行之規定辦理，（三）收兌之金飾，除供熔化製售飾品外，有餘應售予中央銀行，如不足則申請央行補給售出之數量；（四）營業利潤由銀樓業公會參酌營業情形及生活指數，徵求中央銀行之同意後決定之。這幾點意見，應值得財政立法的參考；恢復銀樓金飾買賣及兌換，祇要不滲雜投機的因素，是值得考慮的。</p>
<p>要之，金飾買賣與現在所謂的金條買賣性質是不同的，金飾買賣是人民儲蓄的一種方式；它的本身沒有投機的因素存在。如果它的價值依官價之規定，並不熔化小條出售；而金飾的利潤工資受國家管制，對於政府取締黃金投機的大政策，應該是沒有抵觸的。現在大多數人民對於政府取締黃金投機的措施是擁護的，但對辛苦所得黃金飾物有被凍結，或變成廢物的危險，心理是搖動的。人人動搖，甚非善政。蘇軾曰：「若民所不悅，俗所不安，維有經典明文，無補於怨。」所以財政立法當局，對於當前全國銀樓業合理的非投機的營業，應予以行政救濟！</p>

<h3>美索還租借法項下貸款　蘇聯已允予考慮　美願在現款交易原則下續供蘇物資</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十日電〕蘇聯應向美國償還租借法案項下欠款一百十二萬九千八百萬美金之談判已拖延一年，今日蘇聯已固意加以考慮。然國務院力言，蘇聯尙未允許付款，在美國駐蘇大使史密斯冉三催促之下，莫洛托夫僅允許「老慮」而已。國務院力習於英，法，比，澳，土與紐西蘭諸國之償付租借法案款項事，六月前均已解決，關於中國，希臘，荷蘭，挪威與南非者，目前正在商談之中。</p>
<p>美國前曾六次催請蘇聯開始談判付款事，而蘇聯均之不理，美國國會一怒之下。已於一月一日起停止對蘇之一切輸送。然國務院今日宣稱，美國尙願在現金交易之原則下，以原定在戰後供給蘇聯之價値二千五百萬之糧食，皮革，鋼條，工具，滑　油與礦築機械等運往蘇聯。勝利後一切非現金交易之租借法案停止時，蘇聯曾向美國另外訂購價値二千五百萬之貨物。</p>
<p>至於戰時租借法案項下之一百十二萬九千八百萬元，蘇聯恐將不予以全部支付，蓋原來協定中曾規定「戰時中之損失與消耗，將作為美國之捐贈也。然一部份所剩留之可作民用之戰爭材料，卡軍，與車胎等，蘇聯應照値償付云。</p>

<h3>艾德禮首相在下院發表　英對印政策聲明</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦二十日電〕英首相艾德禮昨日於下院發表對印度政策之聲明稱：「促進印度自治向為英國歷屆政府之一貫政策。在實現此項政策時，印度人民之責任已漸加重，而印度之內政與軍隊亦端賴印度之官民雙方。於憲法方面，則一九一，九年與一九三五年英國國會所通過之法案，均代表英國之將大宗政權移交印度。一九四〇年合政府更承認一項原則，即印度應自行制定一新憲法，建設一完全自治之印度。一九四二年，英政府遂敦促印度一且戰爭終止即當設立制憲團體。</p>
<p>「英政府深感此政策甚為適當，且與健全之民主原理相符。政府執政以來，悉心實行此項政策，希冀早日完成。去年三月十五日首相之聲明深為朝野所贊許，聲明中稱印度人民應自行決定其未來國體及憲法·據英政府看來，印度政府將責任移交印人之時機業已來到。</p>
<p>「去年內閣代表團赴印，與印度代表治商三月有餘，目的即在協助彼輩議決自制憲法之方法，以便交卸責任時可較順利迅速。內閣代表僅於印回不克取得協議時方有所建議。此等建議已於去年五月問公佈，內主張印度之未來憲法應個由一國民大會決定之，而國民大會匯由英屬印度與印度土邦中代表社會各界與各種利益之人組成。</p>
<p>「內閣代表團回國以後，印度已產生一臨時中央政府，參加者為根據現有憲法行施大權之主要各界政治領袖，印度各省政府凡對立法有責任者亦均包括在內。</p>
<p>「現今印度各黨派間意見仍相傾軋，以致國民大會無從發揮其作用，關於此事，英國政府殊覺惋惜，按照原定計劃，國民大會必須代表各方。英政府願將責任移交予同內閣代表團之計劃相符，且經印度各黨派贊同之憲法所規定之負責當局。不幸目前此種憲法與負責當局尙無產生之望，此種現象正充滿危機，殊不宜聽其無限止廣續。英政府茲擬採取必要行勁，將政權於一九四八年六月以前務必移交印度當局。</p>
<p>「印度人口目前已超過四億，最近一世紀中，身為不列願聯邦共和國與帝國中之一份子曾享受到和平與安全。印度人民如欲充分發展經濟，實現較高之生活標準，則今日對和平安全之需要更大，英政府亟願將責任移交予一受全體人民擁護之政府，而此政府必須能維特和平，以公正有效之手段施政。因此印度各黨派亟宜捐棄成見，準備於明年肩起國家之重任。</p>
<p>「內閣代表團經數月之苦心籌劃，對於完成制憲之方法已大致商定，並己於去年五月內以公報方式發表。因此英政府已同意，將符合建議會條件，含有各黨各派代表之制憲會議所製成之憲法向國會提出。惟憲法如未能在第七節所提議之時間內為制憲大會所完成，則英政府即將考慮於限定時間內應將英屬印度中央政府之政權移交何人，英屬印度是否應全部移交與某種方式之中央政府，某數區域是否應移交於現行省政府，或在其他更合理且與印度人民最有利之情勢下移交等問題。</p>
<p>「政權最後之移交雖須俟諸一九四八年六月，然事先必須進行種種凖備。蓋重要之點為印度民事行政之效率必須維持，而其國防亦必須有充分預備。惟移交手續進行期中，欲將一九三五年印度政府法令之條款，逐條實行，無疑必感困難。屆時必將再定新法，以求移交政權事，得以暢行無礙。」</p>
<p>「至於印度各土邦，前如內閣代表團經己明白說明，即英政府無意將屬於土王之權利奧義務移交與英屬印度之任何政府。英政府無意在最後移交政權之限期以前，將印度各邦之君主制度結束，當考慮於過渡期間，與各邦個別成立協議。」</p>
<p>「英政府相信，英國在印度之工商利益，在此新環境下，有經營之好機會。英印問過去有長期而友善之商業關係。今後賡續此關係，必與雙方有利。英政府於結束此項聲明之前，不可不代表英國人民，對走向自治政府最後階段之印度人民，真誠致意。英倫人民無不切望，英印之　雖發發生蘇法之改變，然而兩國人民之關係，決不因此而斷決。英人更望繼續盡力，為印度謀進一步之福利」。</p>

<h3>巿總工會郵務工會決議　要求仍按指數發薪　吳開先對配給表示欠公允</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海巿總工會，昨日下午舉行理監事會議，由該會理事長水祥　主席，除報告上週晋京之經過外，並就各會員所提出關於生活指數凍結後影響工人日後生活等問題，加以詳盡之討論。當推定水祥雲，周學湘，仇長江等二十一人組織請願團，於明日乘夜車晋京向國防最高委員會，行政院，立法院，社會部等有關機關請願，要求維持生活指數，目擬有補救工人生活辦法提出。該團並決定於今明兩日分向巿政府，巿參議會，巿黨部及社會局請願。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海郵務工會以中央公佈經濟緊急措施方案，生活指數宣告凍結，而目前物價不能抑低，勢將影響郵工效率，於昨日上午九時在武昌路該會俱樂部舉行緊急會議。該會理事長王震百，全國郵務工會當務理事水祥雲及漢口，湖南，南京等地郵務工會代表十餘人出席，會商待遇問題，當經決定會同兩路沿綫各地郵務工會代表五十餘人，於明日乘夜車晋京向交通部及有關方面請願，要求仍按照生活指數，發給員工薪餉。該會並擬有新方案提出，如均不能邀政府允准，即將邀集全國郵工赴京大請願。</p>
<h3>本月工資如何發給　日內即可商討决定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自政府公佈經濟緊急措施方案，決定對公敎人員及產業工人供應日用必需品，並規定二月份之工資最高不得超過一月份之生活指數後，本月份工人之工資究應如何發給，頗為各界所關懐。記者昨往訪社會長吳開先，詢此問題，據告目前正與有關方面商討，日內即可決定。</p>
<p>吳氏稱：政府對工廠工作之日用品供應，本月因採辦不及，故自三月起實施。本月份之工資除按照一月份之指數發給外，另將規定供應之每人每月五斗米，一百巿斤煤球，及每半年之兩丈布，就二月份平均價與一月份平均價之差額，折合法幣發給之。該二月份之平均價將由當局公佈。唯總工會對政府此次日用品供應之辦法，表示不滿，認為供應品之數量與種類不應與公敎人員有別。一百巿斤煤球不能煮熟五斗米，而勞力者之食量，不會比勞心者少。况一月份生活指數之編算，工人之食米即以每人斗九升作根據計算者。本人對該項要求，認為合理。且工人有配給，其他公司商號之工作人員無配給，而工次則不得超過一月份之指數，亦欠公平。故本人認為凡工資以生活指數計算工者，應一律辦理。今日（昨日）上午本人在中國銀行二樓與有關首長商討時，為此曾爭論多時，但並無結果，現就交由巿長去請示，必於日內解決云。吳氏並表示，如該項問題不能解決，社會局行事困難，則仍將辭職。</p>
<p>吳氏又稱，將來工人實施配給時，僅由各工廠向社會局登記所需數量，由社會局轉請有關機關配售，公敎人員之配給，巿府另有機構辦理。</p>

<h3>唐人街「巿長」　談僑胞近事　李振輝堅請吳巿長吸雪茄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在祖國的同胞，也許不太熟悉，可是在紐約的華僑，大槪沒有一個不知道李振輝其人的——這位譽為紐約唐人街「巿長」的李先生，出生僑居在美，已有六十年，第一次返國僅在華躭了十八個月，這次欣然作第二次探望祖國，在前天和上海的巿長會面，他感到分外的愉快。一天要吸十支雪茄的李「巿長」，不願獨自享受雪茄的之樂，堅持着請吳巿放下板烟斗，也換上了一支雪茄，於是開始他有趣的談話。</p>
<p>起李氏的英文名呌Shaney（剃頭），他自知人們會奇怪，何以用這一個特別名字，所以他總要告訴大家當他小的時候，他父親常把他的頭剃得光光的，到了學校裏，同學也不知他呌什麽名字，看到他的光頭，就此呌他Shayey。從此除了「光頭」外，沒有人知道他的英文眞名字。</p>
<p>同時因為他每天要抽十支雪茄，他的朋友們給他提了個綽號呌「五乘五」。</p>
<p>紐約唐人街現有華僑六千名，二十年來均在李「巿長」領導之下安居樂業。此外紐約巿三萬華僑，也無不視李「巿長」為領袖。同時他還担任美中華公所的要職。這中華公所，幾乎全美華僑都是會員，它所負的責任，範圍極大，包括舉辦中國敎育，使每個中國兒童，在美國學校放課後，都入中國學校念書。當我國抗戰期間，公所發動每一個華僑每月捐助美金五元貢獻祖國。中華公所並負責救濟失業僑胞，當美國經濟不景氣期間，美政府舉辦救濟全美失業人民，給予工作，中國人中却極少去要求救濟的，因為他們互相帮助，代謀出路。</p>
<p>最値得佩服的事，是在美華僑難得到法院去提出訴訟的事，如果家庭間發生糾紛，往往開家庭會議商決，解決不了的，就由中華公所去調解或裁判。</p>
<p>李　代表在美華僑，尤其是老年人帶給祖國同胞們一句家常之談，他說：「他們多數生長美國，從未見過祖國，他們目前最大的希望，是能回到祖國來一次，老年人都希望回來，在祖國的地下長眠。」華僑每天候船回國的，擁擠有堪，無奈往來船少人多，交通不便。</p>
<p>最後，李「巿長」對吳巿長深表欽佩，他認為吳巿長有紐約巿長拉瓜第亞之才幹，有同樣魄力，可是吳巿長所處環境及需應付各項措施，實比拉巿長更為困難艱苦。</p>

在首都舉行，經費自然由中央支出，在地方還是要中央大量補助。這種定期性的事業經費，應該是經常費而不是臨時費。如果每次舉行全運會，經費統要臨時專案呈請撥發，主辦全運會的敎育部也就很為難了。今年的全運，為顧全主席在台灣運動會開幕時對郝督學更生的面諭，為應付我們五强之一要參加國際舞台的世界運動會，為不使全國體育蜀和熱心體育運動者失望，希望能早作決定，撥發必要的經費來着手籌備進行。而以後每兩年一次的全運會經費，尤希望能從三十七年度起列入敎育文化經費預算的經常臨時門中，勿使每逢全運舉行之年，要令人躊躇。　　關於做一件事情歡喜拖的惰性，實在是建國政治最要不得的。許多人看着舉辦運動會太容易。全運會無論在開會的成績上，或是運動會的影響或實際效果上，必需有相當長的時間。曾記得十九年在杭州舉行第四屆全運會，籌委會宣佈了四月十日開幕，但是直到三月一日，還只有一片空塲子，沒有一點具體的辦法。四十天的籌備，開成一個運動會，實在是夢想不到的事。當時運動還比較幼稚，一切可以因陋就簡的敷衍過去，今天如何能行。試看世界運動會的籌備是四年，中國人雖然聽明能幹，至少總要一年的籌備工夫吧！今天的全運，好在正在復員不久以後，各地運動還沒有恢復以前的標準，如果立即決定宣佈籌備，到還有七個月的時間，總比第四屆要好些，可是希望不要再拖延了。更希望以後倣照世界運動會的辦法，在這次全運會結束的時候，就決定下屆全運會舉行的地點，並且立即組織籌備委員會，作充分的準備。即使今年決定不舉行，也希望成立一個籌備委員會，準備在明年或後年適當的時候，舉行這籌備已經開始而十年後還是難產的第七屆全國運動會。</h3>

<p>飾金處理辦法公布後　銀樓業大起恐慌　存金有限售完勢將停業　明日召開全體會員大會　　〔本報訊〕自財政部於二十日公布施行銀樓及首飾店金飾處理辦法六項後，本市全體銀樓同業，頓起恐慌。昨日下午六時許，銀樓商業同業公會整理委員會各召集人，舉行會議，共商應付對策，要求政府對處置飾金條文，加以修改。最後決議，定於二十三日下午二時，假市商會召開全體會員大會，俾便同業公議今後應採步驟。據該業表示：當局規定存金造冊呈報，限三個月售出。然按實際情形，以各銀樓存金有限，一經發售，祇短時期內即可售罄。此後如各銀樓僅賴些微銀器交易，勢不能維持鉅額開支，惟有坐待停業而已。然查該業同業會員，多至一百八十餘家，未入會之同業，亦有四十餘家。直接間接之職工，多至數十萬人，即將發生嚴重之失業問題。刻成都，漢口，天津，蘇州，無錫，崑山，紹興，鎭江，柳州，廣州等地銀樓公會，或函電紛馳，或派代表前來聯絡，一致主張迅速召集全國銀樓商業同業公會聯合會，共謀救濟之方。在大戶全力操縱下　華股起佧無常　五花八門跌跌停停漲漲　　華股昨先跌繼漲，大戶傾全力操縱，市價起仆甚鉅，但有時祗見喊價而難獲對手，前途變化多端，從業者應早有戒備。　　晨開　九福中法首先漲停，遞永紗開後，六五號一四號八九號九七號二二四號二一八號二一九號一九七號紛售，跌至二五八〇元，三〇號一七八號二二〇號八五號尚納，升至二六三〇元，二二四號二〇三號八三號九五號一七八號三五號九一號一七一號賣出，榮豐又首先跌停，此時永紗乃跌至二四〇〇元。一四號一五二號七四號八五號尚進，再升至二四六〇元，五和信和亦告跌停，人心仍怯，一四五號九五號五〇號一七八號二一九號一九八號九七號三〇號九一號二一五號紛售，美亞現遞同告跌停，遞信和亦告跌停，四號亦賣到二二二〇元，一八八號七六號三〇號九一號八五號一四五號一四號一五六號二一八號二一九號一九七號趁低均進，逐漸拉上，十一時後人心忽振，中法重告漲停，回升至二四六〇元。一四五號二二三號八九號七六號一九九號二一一號雖賣到二三五〇元，二一九號一九七號一四五號二三一號九四號七五號一四號二四號二二四號二八號九五號二〇三號一七一號陸續購買，近午忽起軋空，遞永紗回升至二八四〇元。一四五號一二九號脫手，降至二七五〇元。一七一號二二四號一四五號再買，乃漲到二八六〇元。一九八號二〇三號見高有售而後盤。結果較前收計永紗美亞景福升一成光景，信和新光勤興升半成，華豐徵升，遞交永紗升一成，華豐新光美亞升半成强，信和半成弱，冷股除中法九福漲停，商務微升，餘均下降半成至一成不等。　　午後　一八三二號一八四號均進，遞永紗上塲即告漲停，一九八號脫手，九七號二二四號一三號紛加供給，而步降至二八〇〇元。一四五號八五號趁低購買而尚盤，一五一號一四五號二三五號二二四號再賣到二七五〇元，七六號一二號一八八號二一八號尚納，升爲二八〇〇元。二二四號九一號四九號一五二號一四號脫手，降爲二六九〇元。一七一號二二四號一四五號進至二八一〇元。二二四號二二號八四號再賣小至二七〇〇元。一九八號八九號一八六號二八號力購，回漲到二八四〇元。三時後仍感不支，傳工商貸款已屆收回之期等說，人心忽極度打擎，一五六號二二四號一〇〇號三六號八三號陸續賣出，臨收遂見低價。結果較前收貼價不計，永紗華豐新光徵升，美亞景福勤興微降，信和跌半成，遞交永紗微升，新光華豐徵降，信和跌一成，冷股五和中法漲停，中紡升半成，統益火柴中絲麗安跌一成，餘升降俱微，塲外各股仍見堅定。公債徵挫　　公債昨盤旋不定，證券帮紅客尚有收買，得以支持，僅告微挫，統丙晨開九四〇〇元五〇三室五四四室賣出，自九五〇〇元降至七六〇〇元，四一二室六四五室等有納，升至八五〇〇元結束，結果較前收計各跌一〇渥元，至五五〇元不等，成交不下一千萬元。多頭出籠　外股回降　　外股昨晨疲午堅，臨收仍感不支，良以證券帮之存多，不斷出籠，散買及西商終感不敵也，怡紗晨初低至一七八〇〇元，中午高價二一〇〇〇元，結果較前收計怡紗鋼業業廣紙業怡啤降半成，英聯航業跌一成。中國交通花旗　三行收兌美鈔　　〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨日收兌黃金美鈔情形，與過去數日相仿。該行爲避免擁擠起見，昨起已增添中國，交通，花旗，三銀行，爲美鈔收兌處。又該行除於辦公時間內，收兌各界金鈔外，昨起更另定每日下午五時至八時，專備美海軍人員兌換天鈔云。外銷綠茶　續有交易　　洋莊茶市抽珍。珍屬。針眉。等綠茶，自日前由午昌茶葉公司，及協和。同孚。錦隆等洋行，與賣戶作熱烈之磋商後，昨日市上，續有相當成交。因此過程逐步明期，行情亦頗現秀色。至於祁門紅茶仍因貨方扳特有勁，進購者難以隨心所欲，市勢依然淸寂。他若各式內銷茶，本街店莊及蘇州帮均擬添置，尤以苿莉香片，幾有來者不拒之勢。惜供售者喊價驚人，致買方態度暫取觀望。糖業公會昨開緊爭會　食糖須照限成交　　糖商業公會昨晨十時召開緊急談話會，以奉社會局論，今後交易須嚴遵限價，違則處五年以下徒刑，並對買賣雙方各處罰款示敝，如直接向產地採辦者，亦須遵守議價，嗣後閩廣土塘，亦須送請議價，並凡曾承購第五第六期台糖者，應將承購數量，銷售情形，及實售價格，分別填明：於廿八日前報核云。食糖一批運津　　〔本報訊〕海宙輪昨由秦皇島返滬，運來除水菓等雜賣外，有豆子二千餘包。又培德輪昨駛津，裝去糖七千四百餘包，棉紗四百餘件，疋頭六十餘件，茶葉四百餘箱。青糖市價回升　　昨糖市上落互見，中砂白等無無甚軒輊，惟靑糖以實銷轉動，回升七千元之請。汕頭帮提莊靑呌十二萬八千元，未有成交。順德靑開十二萬四五千元，建帮刁靑初開十一萬九千元，後爲十二萬五千元，均升七千元，成交六百件左右。興化白高莊開二十萬元，次之十九萬五六千元。興化赤十五萬元至十四萬五六千元，台糖公司所標售之赤砂車白冰糖等，實行照申購額對折酊給。出售國營事業　今日集會討論　　〔本報訊〕自政府決定將一部份國營生產事業，以發仃股票方式，公開柏賣或售與民營，且體辦法尚未正式討論，茲悉翁副院長文關已決定於今日召集各委員，商討處理辦法與進行步驟。　　此次準備議渡之國營事業，有中國紡建公司與中華烟草公司，關於舫建公司部分負責人估計，包括上海棉紡織廠，紗錠，綫錠，布機，印染廠，毛紡織廠，及靑島，天津，錦州，營口，瀋陽等處紡廠錠子等，合計總資產當在三萬五千億左右，中華烟草公司方面，據該公司負責人稱，前年接收之時，資產總額估計爲八十億元，依目前情形計算，至少增加二倍，當在二百五十億元左右，唯將來發行股票，自不能以此數計算，或當另有折扣云。　　據工商界方面表示，國營事業改爲民營，固屬一良好政策，惟國營事業資產總額極龐大，而目前之工商界則資力窘乏，恐有力不從心之感，政府對於讓渡事宜，究竟如何處理，頗值得各方注視。桐油喊價又高　　〔本報訊〕足度桐油，昨日市况，喊價又高，上午盛傳國外市價每磅巳提升至美金四角，故有喊四八萬元者。經記者走訪各有關行商，及中植廠方面，咸認紐約之市價，決不能達到四角，並告以最近漢口開價每担四十萬元，亦無多量成交。重慶方面每担三十萬元。以阨於運數，甚少運漢，且近以長江水位低落，運滬出口，亦甚困難。而滬漢價格，相差亦僅能作爲運費之需，芳加上拆息，則難以保本。滬市存底甚少，漢市亦復如此。中植廠最近並無桐油出口云。洋紙價格猛漲　　〔本報訊〕洋紙以定貨不易，結匯亦難，昨市價格猛挺，凡利根白打字紙每令爲十二萬五千元，色紙爲十八萬元，三八磅這林紙每令三十萬元，三二磅二號紙每磅已漲至九千至一萬元。銅版紙每令一百萬元，透明紙每令二百萬元。米市平淡　人心虛軟　　〔本報訊〕昨南北兩市共到米一萬一千石左右，市化平淡。本市當局監督嚴密，內地亦在限價聲中，致人心虛軟。白粳回落一二三千元不一，秈米亦見軟化。白元陰元高定决削。交易價：白粳爲十一萬，薄稻十萬六至九，早稻十萬四，洋秈十萬一至三，白元十一萬八至十二萬入，陰元十一萬七至十一萬九。　　黃豆客帮本街油廠納胃甚殷，節節上升，再高二三千元。豆餅汕廈暢納，步砌二千元。麵粉去化甚燥，續漲千餘元。麩皮消化不良，依然萎靡少神，軋小三五百元。　　油市先堅後回，豆油回跌萬元，生油見挺五六千元，情况升沉互見。芝蔴南洋續辦，挺升六七千元，生仁香港廣州進胃蟬聯，價格步升，續漲萬元。菉豆平平，苞米不振，市勢少神。紅糧下游，盤小千元。赤豆供不應求，回漲三四千元。蠶豆物稀爲貴，猛烈上漲萬元。　　米業分組自肅　　昨日本市食米南市塲，爲加强同業聯繁，於下午召開緊急會議，實行分組自肅，並選舉正副組長。各組組織已告完成，共分十三組，正副組長亦推選竣事。各組負責人爲：一組方嘉亨·陸潤章·二組范松琪·張敏元·三組周子雲·吳世雄·四組胡煥祺·陳德銓·五組王祥德·吳鼎元·六組楊紹庭·沈士蓮·七組鄒聽泉·梅春勤·八組顧人瑞·沈毓剛·九組鄒劍靑·張嶺松·十組孫文泉·諸葛斌·十一組丁子壽·祝震霖·十二組傅昌裕·郭忠鏞·十三組陳吟笙·章欽甫。以上每組管轄米行十家，如有私抬米價，超過十八日標準價者，應由其所管組內正副組長負完全賣任，以杜絕黑市云。紗市人心虛怯　售價逐步下落　　〔本報訊〕昨日紗市轉趨下游，客銷依然沉寂，布廠亦少買進，益以上日經濟監察團責令市塲當局照二月念日行市，准跌不許漲，是以人心虛怯，各支紗綫乃呈逐步下落之况，迄收市時，念支紗約小念萬左右，四十二支去化允呆，狂跌三四十萬之多。　　中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售一八八五件。內除六十件係該公司自售之紗外，其餘係代紡管會所售之紗。所售之紗中，廠商佔八八七件，號家佔九九八件。申請戶數共計四四一戶，廠商二二七戶，號家二一四戶。輪出推廣會討論　蛋類輸出問題　　〔本報訊〕輪出推廣委員會執委會，於昨日上午十時，在中央銀行召開會議。到主委貝祖飴，副主委楊錫仁，執委劉攻芸，金士宣，沈熙瑞，顧問麥克，羅傑士等。會中對蛋類之輪出，討論綦詳。同時並研究如何遏止出口外匯之逃避辦法云。　　桐油小組人選决定　　該會各種小組會，已成立者有蛋類，桐油，兩組。蛋類小組會人選，已誌昨日本報。桐油小組會召集人劉攻芸，麥克，委員李銳，沈端洲，凱世威，趙石湖，兼秘書邱良榮。其他各組，亦可望於下週內全部成立。此中蛋類小組會，召開會議已達六决之多。該會今後會務之展開，將以各小組會爲活動之中心云。柏油實銷清談　牛油腳地堅定　　〔本報訊〕昨市柏油以來源充沛，實銷轉爲。嘉興本車，每担做開價爲三十六萬，較前市又下跌四萬元。漢口貨麻城拆雪等每祖亦下跌四五萬元。據業中人云：柏油市便距最高峯時下跌計達八成至一倍，實由銀根抽緊，皂廠去化轉呆所致。但椰油來源斷絕，市貨匱乏，故市面仍將回上。牛油執貨者，仍不肯脫手，到貨較少，蚌埠貨每担仍在四十二萬元。棉布市况轉疲　　棉布晨開平穩，嗣以籌碼充沛，市况轉呆，又以隔昨紡建開售各種布疋，聞龍頭細布照單全配，同業存底告充，廠家辦意轉懈，喊價遂告虛軟，五福晨開十四萬六千五，收價爲十四萬五，較前市挫小三五千元不等，士林色布等俱鮮變化云。銀行保證業務　應照規定辦理　　財部以銀行辦理一般保體業務，除對捲菸廠商領取印花，仍得保證外，餘應照劃一銀行會計科目規定者爲限。即發行委託購買證，發行商業信用證，辦理票據保證三項，以賣减少風險及糾紛。海味市况趨疲　　海味市况在極度波動之後，似已趨疲。西洋貨如海參，魚翅，蝦尾，生粉等，來源不繼，存底化薄，趨勢雖堅，而實銷銳减，脚地呈軟。洋菜，紫菜，湘運，木耳，自上漲之後，去化長滯。香菇路貨續到，雖成本較高，然開擊仍未見秀。干貝，冬菇，到銷兩稀，其勢堅穩。蜻干海咸乏人問津，市極萎疲。其餘各貨尚未許樂觀。國藥銷路呆滯　　國藥市况，自西藥湧到以後，頗有一蹶不振之勢，市價雖一度被黃金風潮帶上二三分利，終因農村經濟脆弱，外埠添配，亦屬鷄零狗碎。躉批大包，難得成交，去路如此呆滯，市價因而疲軟。然產地價格，與申售形成倒掛，本埠行商受去路關係，亦殊少做開，市塲交易殊爲沉寂。洋行扒吸甚勁　生絲成交數起　　本日絲市於疲中帶堅下，頗有成交。外銷方面除美市塲存底充足，無納冐外，英印。瑞士各國，扒吸頗勁。今晨運納洋行做開D級二十担，價爲七百九十五萬元。壁勒洋行做開D級三十担，價爲七百九十萬元。遠昌洋行做開C級四十担，價爲八百二十萬元。其餘用戶另担交易亦頗多，價較昨市約高五萬元左右。原料核發竣事　絲廠開工在即　　〔本報訊〕絲織產銷聯營公司，昨已將絲織協導會核發之生絲二百担，人造絲三百箱入棧。按該公司與協導會所簽訂之一百五十份合同計算，承織絲廠，的在二百家之譜，織機共達一千六百卅二台。巳領得之第一批原料，已定於廿三廿四兩日，分發各廠，下週可望開工織造云。四區絲織工業　今日成立公會　　〔本報訊〕第四區絲織工業同業公會，刻已籌備魷緒，已定於今日下午三時，假康樂酒家舉行成立大會。屆時將通過會章，改選理監事。按該公會前身，即係上海市電機絲織工業同業公會，會員共有三百八十四家。此次聞實係變更名義，實際範圍，仍僅限於上海市內之絲織同業云。永泰和煙公司　普銷大英老刀　　永泰和烟公司定自即日起，委託捲烟燭皂商業公會，辦理普派全市捲烟零售商號捲烟，每家得派廿支大英五條，派價每條一萬三千六百元。十支老刀三盒，派價每盒二萬六千元，業已開始繳款出貨，捲烟市價有回降可能。介紹　股票套息表　　本市浙江興業銀行設計處，爲使經營股票者計算現遞套息起見，特編製「上海證券交易所股票套息表」一種，附有詳細說明及實例，對套做交易之凈利率，一查即得，該表現已由江西路二六七號三樓經濟周報社出版，售價一千元云。漫談輪入限額分配制度　（續）  步兵　　第二：關於進口商品的輸入總量如何決定？在理論上，從國內消費量扣除國內生產量，其餘額便是可以從外國進口的總量。但是，現實的問題，却並不如此簡單。因爲，國內消費量以及生產量，並不能絕對的豫定；那末，以什麼做標準，來決定它，便成爲問題了。在現實上，雖然是根據過去數字而決定的時候居多，但是所謂過去，又當以何年或何等範團的平均數字爲依據呢？這又。是麻煩的問題。而且，假使在某種程度上，要抑制國內的消費，或是獎勵國內的生產，若是照着過去的數字，毫不加减地運用，是否有當，便又成爲問題！其次，與進口總量有關的，還有許多其他問題。是否以這個數量爲絕對的輸入數量，超過這個數量，便要禁止進口；還是以這個數量爲標準；在它以下，課以比較低的關稅；若是超過了這個數量，便課以較高的關稅呢？前者是純粹的限額分配制，後者則是限額分配與關稅的複合運用。究竟那一種爲適當呢？這又是要加以具體的特殊的考慮而後才可以決定的問題。　　第三：對外的比額問題。首先是對外要不要分酊限額？即進口的各國，應當各各決定一個分酊限額呢？還是只決定了進口的總量，而由進口國自由選擇呢？假如單是爲限制進口，以保護國內生產爲目的，似乎是不必要對外分配比額；然而第一要使轍入制限能實現得比較確實，則以分酊限額，給予各國，比較適宜。第二限額分配制度，倘使附帶有其他目的，例如視對手國的關係而與以相當的差別待遇，則對外便不能不實行限額的分配。在這種塲合，對於各國若是實行平均的分配，則問題比較簡單；然而平均的分配，不能說是必然公正的分酊。於是在現實上，究應依照何種標準，對各國發給不同的比額呢？其標準又以何爲根據呢？雖說不外乎是根據過去的數字，但是問題便在過去的數字，應當如何採擇？例如：有採用過去十年的平均的，有採用五年平均的，也有採川最近一二年平均的。可是在最近國際經濟經過激烈變動的時代，根據何種數字，才可以使分配與各國的數量公平合理，所謂「基準年度」問題，在實際上乃成爲最困難的問題之一了。因爲在如何採取基準年度的問題中，國內生產者與外國輸出業者之問，以及外國輸出業相互之間，常常有截然不同的利害關係存在。　　第四：在對外分配限額時，如何可以確實保特各國的比額？這問題是在如何與轍出國家的官吏或民間團體取得連絡。即在對手國的內部，若將分配與該國的數量再分配於其輸出業者或是生產業者之問，則或者可以比較確實的維持此項分配的限額。例如法國，當時對於各外國的官吏，或是產業團體，便曾經授以權限，使之管制對法輸出的比額。這樣，雖然是可以免去不少因實行限額分酊制度而生的煩瑣；但是，同時也有不少缺陷。最主要的是：第一，關於輸入品的本國選擇權，授與外人，等於紹外國人以統制轍人價格的機會；第二，對於各國的比額之寶施，難免有不公平之弊；因爲在有這種制度的對手國家，它可以由其官更或產業團號的查定而輸出分酊的數量；反之，在沒有此項制度的國家便不免完全是出於偶然的的輸出了。　　第五：關於對內的分配問題，在實行分配以前，若使輪入業者先爲自由轍入，俟達到規定的輸入總量，再禁止其爲超過此數量以上的輪人，則易於使外國的轍出業者與國內的輸入業者，互相競爭，輸入數額與業態必然發生動搖不安的傾向。所以在實際上，對於國內的輸入業者，不得不以過去的數字爲執行分酊時的基準，法國對於農產物的進口分配，便是保留輸入總量的一部份與新興業者，而將其餘大部份照從來經營的數量，比例分配於國內轍入業者。在農務部中設置專門委員會，統轄一切。專委會以下，再分設小組委員會，管理從分配所得的數量，以及申請進口時之核准手續。又就一九三三年三月所實施的品目，在海關准許進口以前，先須獲得法國生產者聯合會之承認。這個方法，是爲保障輸入總量，可以適合規定數量；但因爲减少了輪入競爭。結果是否可認爲最有利的轍入，則爲另一問題。　　第六：分配制的期間問題。分配限額制，在現在仍不脫一緊急處分，所以普通都是附有期限的，於是期限的長短，便先成爲問題。在法國是因各種項目之不同，而期限亦隨之而異。短自一個月，長至一年。其間長長短短，各各不同。但以三個月爲最普通。土耳其自　一九三一年十一月以後，除原料品外，對於大部份轍入品，差不多每月都實施輸入分配制。每月分配似乎失之太短，不但事務繁雜，而且使輸入業者感覺不安。反之，一年的期限，又未免太長，不能順應事情的變化，而爲適當的修改，所以普通都以三個月爲最適中，可以應事實的必要，而爲更新的施策。又在必要的塲合，還可細分之爲每一個月的比額。如生鮮食料品，且須每週定其分配額。如是季節的分酊，不過為權宜之訂，但最後必須能確保三個月或一年的總量。例如爲確實知悉一年的輸入總量，至少必須到這一期間的最後的幾天之後，到了若干日數之後，才能確知規定數量，是否適合，所以必定要望其正確適合，事實上頗爲不易。在這種塲合，更可按季節而小分之，使各個短期間的規定數量與現實數量能相接近。是後則爲關聯於期間的問題，分配制是否承認其有追溯力？在法國大槪有許多場合，對於最初的分酊，是承認可以追溯及某期間的。因此常引起外國轍出業者的不滿，但在更新的塲合，則全無問題。　　以上種種，迄今尚無定論，大抵隨藩商品的種類及事情如何，而爲因時制宜的或特殊的決定；因爲限額分酊制度，到現在還是在不斷的成長和試騐之中，尚未達到可以一般論斷的時期。（完）</p>

<p>狂熱的西班牙情調　歌舞昇平的洛杉磯  一月廿五日航訊　本報駐美特派員毛樹清　　美國西海岸有三座大海港：西雅圖·舊金山·洛杉磯·西雅岡在西北角上的華盛頓州。舊金山和洛杉磯，等於加利福尼亞的兩顆品瑩的寶石。　　加利福尼亞從開發到現在，還不過百餘年。洛杉磯的繁榮，僅僅是最近三十年問的事。三十年以前，美國東部紐約芝加哥的百萬富翁，在老年退休的時候，到洛杉磯來買上幢房子，『做息影田園』的寓公。這裹恬靜，淸潔，風土都適間，特別還有終年不變的溫暖的陽光！　　雨天一年兩週　　洛杉磯一年平均祇有兩星期雨天。每年，在聖誕誕節新年之交，有些潮濕的日子，除此以外，每天都是陽光煦和的世界。我告訴他們：兩年以前，我住過埃及的開羅，開羅大槪一年祗下三天雨，某一年下了四天，老百姓都認爲奇蹟。大槪：人類文化離不開氣候的因素，開羅之所以成爲人類古又明的淵源，洛杉磯之所以成爲全世界電影的「聖城』，都因爲有得天獨厚的李用不盡的陽光。然而，開羅的終年的陽光，多少感覺　燥，夏天的時候太熱。洛杉磯却不然，終年一套西服，不會嫌多，也不會嫌少。就溫度這點上說：洛杉磯像昆明，一年四季是春秋。　　我是中國的暦年夜到洛杉磯的。囚爲價錢便宜和看得淸楚的緣故，我選擇了搭長途公共汽車。格乘弘汽車公司，把這一條綫定名爲『沿海公路』，我在上車的時候，就存有那麼一個希望：我要仔細細地看一看太平洋！　　失望的是：實際並沒如理想的滿意。公路大半都在山谷問行走，從舊金山到洛杉磯，全程四百四十三英里，走了十五個鐘點才到達，沿綫每一個小站都停，鄕下佬隨時隨地都可以上車下車，汽車公司固然給沿綫的居民以方便，但是，作爲一個長途搭客的我，那就不勝其「三里一停，五里一歇」之苦了。　　一路上，我感覺最深的一個影象，那便是濃厚的西班牙的情調。在前决幾篇通訊中我已經說過：加利福尼亞是一個西班牙文化開發的省份，再加上中國人的勞力與血汗。我留意沿途許多小城市，都有掛着『雜碎』招牌的中國飯館。沿途三四十座城鎭的名字，除了King　City一處以外，其餘盡是西班牙文的遺跡。美西戰爭，美國打敗了西班牙以後，他們並沒有更改這些西班牙文字的城鎭地名，久而久之，相沿相發，也就習以爲常了。　　一座最顯著的西班牙城市，呌做「聖旦巴巴拉」，在浴杉磯北面九十多英里，靠臨太平洋。汽車在那兒停了牛小時，我看到西班牙式的建築，穿著西班牙服裝的少女，來回奔馳在街頭巷尾。他們圍著人們歌唱舞蹈，有一種狂熱的拉丁情調。在聖瑪鹿亞城，我看見墨西哥服裝的騎士，揚長而過。　　太平洋的風光是綺麗的，當汽車開出『聖路易奧必斯波』城以後，穿過兩座小山，居然到達了太平洋海岸，那時候，恰好是夕陽西沉，廻光映著藍色的海水，閃爍著萬消道光茫。汽車繞過一個呌做『披斯摩』的小鎭，又躱進山谷裏去了。　　半夜穿過好萊塢，到洛杉磯是半夜一點鐘，預先沒有定旅館，臨時雇了一輛街車，到處亂撞，化了、一個半鐘頭，急得冷汗直置，最後才在一家小客棧權宿一宵。第二天淸早，總領事館鎮振聲兄，才替我介紹了凱電州洛飯店。　　一座新興都市　　全美國都鬧房荒，因爲房荒，旅館都『利市百倍』。但是，洛杉磯的情形特別嚴重。洛杉磯是一座新興的都市，現在的人口，超過二百萬，洛杉磯市的轄境，擴張到四百五十平方英里。但是，洛杉磯的旅館，仍然寡若晨星。不但少，而且不夠現代化。如今，走在洛杉磯大街上，還依然看得見很多小規模的客店，美國招牌上，呌做Rooms。這些小客棧，雖然較『未晚先投宿，雞嗚早看天』的四川客棧高明些，但點綴在一座美國第四位的大都市中，令人有不調和的感覺。　　另外一個原因，造成洛杉磯的嚴重房荒的，是退伍軍人的紛紛歸來。退伍軍人有兩叛，一種是原先住在洛杉磯的，當然他們應該歸來。第二種是原先住在其他各州各城的，戰爭期中，他們經過洛杉磯出征到海外去，知道這見氣候好，環境好，回國退伍以後，就遷住洛杉磯，因爲在道裏謀生容易，例如遙樣的退伍軍人，很多很多，更增加了洛杉磯的房荒。此外，電影事業的發展，好萊塢控制了全世界的電影市場，當然，會增加洛杉磯的繁榮與人口數字。（註：好萊塢是洛杉磯市內的一區）。中國人在洛杉磯　　中國人在洛杉磯，的摸有七千人。華僑祖孫相傳，在洛杉磯甚至有「四代同堂」的。年靑的現在大部份都有美國國籍。這次抗戰勝利以後，許多華僑向領事館請發護照，先後回國。　　洛杉磯有新舊兩處「唐人街」，規模此舊金田的小，比紐約和芝加哥的也小。老唐人街原先開設有很多飯館洗衣作，後來因爲建設火車站，把一大半房屋都拆除，市政當局爲補償此一部份的損失，另外指定地區，准許僑胞建屋居住，這便是所謂新唐人街的淵源。　　華僑稱洛杉磯爲『羅省』，這是因爲譯音不同的緣故，洛杉磯不是『省』，所以中國外交官銜名稱，改爲『羅安琪』，仍然有遷就廣東譯音的意義在內。中國文字對美國地名的翻譯，當地僑界和國內很有不同。倒如：華僑稱舊金山爲『大埠』，稱西雅圖爲『舍路』，稱聖路易爲『新壘』。祇有紐約是統一的。　　我聽在洛杉磯多年的李道榮收師說：這裏的華僑人爲的環境，較美國任何其他地方較優。很多僑胞，在這裏奮鬥十餘年，購地買屋，儼然寫家翁姿態。並不像其它城市，一律都是洗衣作，或開飯館。他說：這兒的蔬菜農產市塲，控制在華僑手裏，若干華僑，已經成爲本市蔬菜農產的控制者，他們接受農民的產品，再分配賣給食物商店，或『批發店』。這樣，每天轉手經紀的，都可以有一個回扣和佣金，這數目累積起來，就十分可觀。　　好萊塢　一闊客　　李牧師夫婦駕車帶我參觀第九街及羅杉磯街轉角附近的蔬菜成交市場。一排排的房屋，很多爲華僑所有。有一位姓王的華僑，經營的範圍最大，他現在在好萊塢附近有最漂壳宏偉的住宅，是當今好萊塢的『闊老』之一。　　我沒有機會和姓王的深談，祗在江易生總領事歡宴馮煥章先生的宴上，見了一面。馮將軍考察團，駕目備軍過洛杉磯遵歷南方，對洛杉磯僑界發表政見，擁護罵歇爾的對華用明，並且還鼓勵僑胞子弟，多受敎育，那晚上，李德全女士也有演講，描寫中國婦女界在對日抗戰入年間的貢獻　　洛杉磯給我的影象是美好的。就我兩天來周覽市容的印象，我覺得這裏幾乎是一個純粹消費的都市。洛杉磯正街，百老匯路，奧力蕪路，人山人海的擠滿著行人，街心前踵後接的擠滿著汽車。百貨公司的規校，大得不亞於紐約，許多大公司大商店的招牌上，寫明:『美國西部最大的××』。三多　理髪店　照相館　酒排間　　洛杉磯有三多，照相館多，理髮店多，酒排問多。我計算過洛杉磯正街柏格萊旅館前後四五百碼之間，有十五家不同形色的照相館，掛著許多和上海重慶一樣的廣告照片，有幾家還標明幾小時送到，有幾家作者『藝術超羣』的標語。還是洛杉磯的人歡喜照相的緣故？還是受了好萊塢電影的影響？更或是照相的成本便宜？我沒有詳細打聽。不過，就我流覽玻璃廚窗內的『樣品』，我並沒發現他們的技術較芝加哥或紐約高越之處　　在美國任何大都市理髪，通常都得按决序等上半小時，甚至一小時。但長洛杉磯例外。洛杉磯的理髮店，大部份是西班牙種的墨酉哥人或南美洲人所經營。往往一條小街上，同時排列着好幾家理髮店。至於酒吧，那就更不可計數了。　　酒排問裏洋溢着歌舞昇平的迷人的音樂，人爲的暗淡的燈光下，閃爍着大眼睛的西班牙（墨西哥和南美）姑娘，她們唱迷人的歌，向流水一般進出的人們媚笑。我看見好幾家酒吧的門上，貼着『歡迎男賓』的招徠廣告，有一家寫着：『特別歡迎海陸軍官兵』。　　除了數不淸的拉丁情調的酒排問以外，洛杉磯更有像巴黎一樣的大腿戲，有像上海一樣的『土耳其按摩院』。我流覽過一家呌做『卡洛爾』的大腿戲館。幾乎盡是低級趣味的『俚語』。其『誨淫』的程度，在紐約和華盛頓，是絕對被禁止取締的，但是，在洛杉磯這片花花世界上，却到處是紙醉金迷的空氣，到處是歌舞昇平的景象！（於洛杉凱電陸旅館）一千三百分里　粵漢路　全綫觀我　美國  紐約時報記者所見　　記者甫經究畢粵漢藏路上一千三百公里的旅程，這條把中國南部富張而孤立的省分廣東和中國心臟連接起來的鑯路，自從通軍以後，其在中國人民生活上的重要性，顯得非常之大。在戰時它曾經在日軍侵入前决第被破壞了不少。今年上半年的修復通車，實爲中國國防準備上的主要努力之一。　　艱鉅工程　　粵漢鐵路全綫延伸在戰亂區城之南，但是它對於內爭的重要性却依然不减。通車以來，大部即用於軍隊的輸送，此外亦曾用以運米以及許多其他的軍需品。今後所可期望於粵漢路的，當是更多的貢獻。　　除掉軍運以外，後方並可賴以安定，足以解除其經過地區的經濟壓迫。　　重建粵漢路，對於政府本身的工作情緒以及其在國內的聲譽，均將大有帮助。就工程而言，它夠得上稱爲一件艱巨的工作。　　粵漢鐵路，大部被破壞於一九四四年內和一九四五年上半年。命令而爲者。蔣主席當時即曾昭示國人：至少應阻止日本人在六個月之內將粵漢路加以使用。　　當時所破壞的路綫，有些正當中國南部最高峻最荒野的山岳地區之中，這種地方實在是施行破壞工作最理想的地形。鐵路員工把這種有利的地理環境利用得很好，他們把路軌拆散，裝在敞蓬火車上開進山洞裏面去，然後將整個山洞加以炸毀。他們又建造通往峻峭山谷邊緣的支綫，將滿載的車輛滾進裏面，他們把全綫一百十九個主要橋樑破壞了一百零兩個，把鋼鐵的底盤摔到溝渠裏去，並把大多數的鋼骨水泥橋柱自行催毀。大部殘破的遺跡，至今依然存在。任何旅行的人，對於其餘部份破壞的强烈亦必不難想像得出。總之，日本人從未能利用過粵漢鐵路，確是顯而易見的。　　西班牙情調的歌舞——聖旦巴巴拉（本報特派員毛樹淸寄）　　五萬人力　　在修復中，有一個時期，全部工作人員。計達五萬人之衆。其中死於此項工作者，據估計，的有五六百人，全部工程費，達國幣五百億之鉅。當全路完工時，共鋪新軌二百七十公里，所造木橋，長達五千公尺。　　在橋身尚可重用，修理，或補綴的地方，它們即被仍應用於原處或者作爲任何其他地方較大橋樑的應急材料。在缺乏鋼鐵的地方，橋樑即由附近樹林中的新鮮木料搭成。日軍在鐵路約有幾段中間，曾經自己建造木橋，但是大都不甚牢固，並且高度也不夠在大水的時候應用。它們大多數，均需加以修改或者重建。　　木橋奇觀　　有些新的木橋，實在蔚爲奇觀。它們延伸過深邃廣闊的河床，好像有幾千隻脚的蜘蛛網一樣。有些地方，它們即全部架設在殘破的舊鋼鐵橋身之上。所用木料砍削均極粗糙，連接的方式亦極草率。　　有些沉重鋼鐵橋身，搬回應用地點的經過，亦屬大觀。在一座橋上，記者看到每段重二百三十八公噸的橋身，一共四段，已經舖放完畢，其中有兩段，平躺在河底。在做此項工作時，可供應用的機械僅爲四個鐵夾起重機。又當全毀了的鋼骨水泥柱脚加以重建的時候，工人們在不斷加高的鐵路枕木堆上曳起橋身，直至高出地面十八公尺的應用地位爲止。這項工作，耗費了他們六個月的時間，其中大部份時間，並須與洪水搏鬥。在工作最緊急時，有六七百人同時參加，爲了完成工程，會經用到六萬根枕·木　　目前列車的行駛，極端緩慢，運輸量非常有限。一部分原因在於新的結構不牢，列車通過許多橋樑時並不比步行快多少。但是主要原因，則仍在車輛的缺乏。全綫機車來自世界各國，因此，零件均不能互用，並且全路絕無可作重大修理的機廠。中國人隨機應變的天才，使得各物仍能勉强應用，但是效率乃不勉大减。例如：開始應用造橋鋼修補鍋爐的時候，同時就必需减低蒸汽的壓力。　　由漢赴粵　　在這條鐵路上的旅程，並不十分舒適，某種程度以內的誤卯，在所不免的。從漢口到廣州，只化了五十小時多一點的時間，和戰前最快的卅六小時比起來，並不算太壞。記者所乘坐的是二等臥車，現在則已升級爲頭等客車，車中絕無華華貴設備，坐凳係用木製，僅在上面裝上棉布墊子而已，列車上的鉛管設備，正像你所能想像得到的那樣地壞，吃飯完全是簡單的中國菜，全懣廚十做主，從最　的到很好的都有。車上服務可算週到，供應着在中國旅行的基本需要——杯時常有人冲開水的茶和水遠充足的熱手中。　　杜愼達氏　　這條鐵路做着大量的客運業務，生要的是三等乘客，他們常常變通地被收容於貨車之中。同時，運米至廣東沿海區域再把鹽運回來的貨運業，亦頗不惡。　　有一個走過全錢的美國工程師告訴記者說，他認爲照所能應用的材料而論，沒有人能比這個做得更好。但是這句話，並不能應用到山國政府目前一切的復員努力上去。　　這件工作，同時經過了許多計劃工作，主要的功績似乎很明顯地應該歸於粵漢鐵路的董事長，曾經受過康乃爾訓練的土木工程師杜愼遠。杜氏曾經建造過另外兩條華南的主要鐵路。建造鐵路是他所畫歡並且夢想着的工作。當粵漢路正式重畫完成以後，他將願意在任何別的地方再建造一條更偉大的鐵路。　　殷切企望　　差不多己經和美國大事業家相似的，杜氏是一個美國方法的忠實信徒。他常常說，他正在試着想使他的鐵路設備夠上美國標準，則使對於幾個爲澳洲製造的機車，亦正在使其配備合乎美國條件。杜氏說，他希望得到美國顧問加入粵漢路以建立鐵路工程上和鐵路管理上的美國制度。杜氏又說派遺留學生到美國去學習鐵路業務，實爲愚笨之舉。在中國建立起一條美國鐵路因而能讓這些留學生在國內學習，要較之高明得多。　　正像山國每一個需要配備的人一樣，杜氏企望最股的還是美國的物資援助。現狀下的粵漢路僅是應急的工程，照現在的計劃，是永久性的整修工程應即開始。（山風譯）讀者意見規約　　（一）本欗绝对公开，文寶自負。但切忌長。（二）切勿攻訐私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件。並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆明。（四）本欄稿件概不致酬。（五）對來稿本報有刪節之權。（六）來稿披　與否，槪不函復。（七）本報於必要時。得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。　　抑平物價管見　　邇來物價瘋在上漲，政府用政治力量，制成方案，以謀抑平物價，法意固善，然抑者自抑，漲者自漲，商人唯利是圖，欲與談國計民生，直如與虎謀皮。至日用品配給辦法，祗限於公敎人員，農民店員苦力胥抱向隅，容非事理之平，抑且手續煩重，故筆者意見，與其勞政府支配，不如圍人民自救，人民欲脫離商人剝削之苦，唯一途徑，即普遍組織消費合作社是也。　　合作事業之重要，國父早巳昭示，各地亦多實施，惟辦理不能盡如理想，故健全者絕少，今則物價漲勢已成燎原，商人在高利貸高工賣高捐稅之情形下再力求高利潤，一切加諸消費者頭上，欲求抑價，豈非株木求魚，此消費合作社之設，所以不容再緩，更不能再同以前之有名無實也。　　消費合作社，應以日用必需品爲對象，而不以盈利爲目的。在一定地區內設置一所，（如每保或每鄕鎭）即以居住該地區之住戶爲社員，並限制其權利，隨時估計地區內社員需要消費之數量，向直接生產處採辦，採辦時政府應儘量與以利　域减免其捐稅，生產處亦應儘晨給予優先供應，必要時且得酌供低利之貸欲，如此則人民不啻自動實行配給，抵制商人之熊斷底於自給自足。　　社內之經濟，力求公開，最好每酊售一次，將成本售價餘額公布一决，旣可取得社負，亦可杜絕執事者藉職務上之便利，施其囤積牟利之拔，惟茲事體大，最好於京滬或都市中先行試辦，作爲楷模，然後推行各縣鎭鄉村。一得之見乞貴報賜予披露，以供社會人士之研計。（小魚）滿目棕櫚樹的洛杉磯街景　（本報特派員毛樹淸寄）揚子江流域　農田水利　（下）  孫輔世　　平原地農田地勢平坦，有廣大之湖泊，縱橫之溝渠，使水源充足。水位之漲落旣徵，而水位田面之差亦少，偶需隄防，然大部低矮，排水問題亦無多困難，故無大旱盛潦，以簡單之汲水工具即足以調節水量之需要。　　平原地農田在揚子江流域以太湖流域範圍最廣，其餘在各處堤垸邱陵之間，略有分佈而已。　　太湖流域幾全部爲平原地農田。全面積三萬九千餘平方公里，熟地面積的四千萬畝，佔全面積之四分之三，達全國已耕面積三十分之一。全年米之產額自三千萬石至四千萬石。域內山嶺除東西天目山外，僅有若干孤立之山邱，故山洪之爲患範圍甚狹（僅苕溪中上游）。湖泊水道之面積佔全面積之什一，故容蓄之量甚宏。揚子江橫亘其北，節節溝通，故甚得其排納之功。港汶塘浦，密佈如網，故調節極稱便利，所以旱溢之患甚少，水位田面之差，少者不過半公尺，多者亦不過三公尺，灌溉排水費力至微。　　城內農田水量之調節，在昔全恃水車（龍骨車）藉人力或畜力以資轉動。如水頭低者（一公尺以內），效率極高，運用及遷移，尤為便利。　　太湖流械之西北部武進金壇丹陽一帶，地勢較高，水位田面相差的在三公尺以上，一級水車已不足以達此高度，乃需二級或三級方克汲水以入田。且有田地面積廣闊而汲水地點有限，於是汲水之水量亦不足以供給田內之需要。在上述兩種情形之下，人力裔力及舊式之水車，遂均不適用，而改改用機力，實爲最切合之辦法。　　戽水勞力之耗費，在太湖流域稻田耕作費用之春耕，栽秧·除草·收獲以及種子，肥料等項內，賓佔最大之成份·計每畝收穫之之成本的爲八至十元之譜，而戽水費的自一元至四元，視雨量之是否調勻及水頭之高下爲準（戰前標準）。　　太湖流域之機力戽水，創始於民國十三年用離心力抽水機，分由電動機及柴油機拖動，油機連同抽水機大都均裝船上，蓋爲一流動性之戽水站，用電力者，則有固定之戽水地點，但亦有將電動機及抽水機裝置在船上者，惟因輸電綫路設備之關係，其應用之地點仍有所限制也。　　流動之性戽水機船，首應有暢通之水渠，以作交通之道，臨時之戽救工作以及範圍較大之零星田畝，運用最爲便利，但因其裝置爲地位所限，，未能盡行合理，故效率較低。其費用每以一畝一季若干（普通在兩三元左右）包戽，其臨時戽救者，則以時間計，太湖流域此積戽水，機船在最盛時不下數千，其機件均爲國內自製，抽水機以十吋及十二吋者爲最多。　　固定之電力戽水站，其管理較流動之柴油戽水機船爲便利，大都以一千畝爲一站，的用二十四馬力電動樓及十吋進水管之抽水機各一具，長距離之輸電設備錢路之損失，以及田間水溝之耗慘均爲電力不如油機之點。且我國小農爲多，每戶所耕，均在十畝以內，而又經界不淸，業主不明，故欲使千畝之田，共同合作，困難滋多。至於偷漏及不必要之消損更所難免焉。　　太湖流域之油機戽水船，均爲私人所有，扶術及管理均極簡陋，故工作效率及可靠程度反遠不如電力也。　　電力戽水在太湖流域，始自戚墅堰電廠，蘇州雷廠及吳興電廠，蘇州及吳興兩地，均濱臨湖邊，地勢較低，機力犀水之效不著，戚墅堰電廠適位在太湖流域西北高原之區，後又經作者在建設委員會灌漑管理局任內接辦，予以擴充整理，故較具規模。　　離心力抽水機國內製造者頗多，然效率則使及歐美製造者之三分之二，低者的爲百分之三十，高者亦不過百分之五十。　　濯溉工具之改良以水源之供給無缺，爲其先決條件。太湖流域因位在江湖之間，故來源無虞匱乏，而河渠溝通之道，乃爲其主要關鍵，故自吳越錢氏盡心江南水利，即以撩淺浚河爲急務。當時置有都水庸田使督撩淺夫凡七八千人，並規定五里一橫塘，七里一縱浦之制。其後歷代整治，亦以浚渫爲主，而輔以築閘修堤。域內農田至今仍享其利。　　元代任仁發之言，整理太湖流域水利最爲切合。其語曰：「浚湖港必深，築堤岸必高厚，置閘竇必衆多。設邁水旱，就三者而乘除之，自然有利無害。」　　堤垸地農田與揚子江中下游　　堤垸地農田，在昔均屬湖泊低籠之地，或江水盛漲時泛濫之所；後以沙泥之淤澱，人民之筑堤建垸，遂成居憇耕作之區。且以土地之肥沃，水道運輸之便利，常爲農業生產之中心區域焉。　　堤垸地農田，實爲揚子江防洪之主要目標，而亦爲揚十江流域內農田水利亟待改進之中心區域。兩者有相互密切之關係，蓋洪水之年形增高，實由於沿江沿湖之任意圍墾，而其本身亦即形成爲災患之所。　　古人防洪之週，倡不與水爭地之說，近又有撥田還湖之議，此實消極之諭。按此項農田面積，共達五千萬畝，其關係國計民生之重要，不言而喻，自不能因噎而廢食；問題在事前有整個具體之計劃劃耳。　　堤垸農田之分佈情形的略如次：　　（一）洞庭湖區　八百萬畝　　（二）中游北岸區　一千三百萬畝　　（三）漢水下游區　五百萬畝　　（四）金樊區　三百萬畝　　（五）鄱陽湖區　七百萬畝　　（六）蘇皖區　一千三百萬畝　　各區低田之悄况，除低窪之程度不同外，大致相似。保障之道，除减低洪水峯外，首屬堅固之堤垸，此項外水之防禦，均屬防洪之主要工作，至於內水之如何調節，乃屬晨田水利之範圍。　　內水之調節工程，分灌溉及排水兩項。其辦法計（一）涵閘（二）溝渠系統（三）機力抽水。　　涵閘之用有二：爲於春夏，如雨量不足而江水已漲，農田缺水，乃賴涵閘以引江水。迨秋後江水已落，而田內積水尚深，則仍須藉涵閘以排積水。　　溝渠又如人身之血脈，欲來灌溉排水之功效，有系統之溝渠自屬必要。　　低　之農田，因揚子江流域雨量之充沛，而夏秋水稻季節又適爲江水高漲之際，積潦之排除，最爲重要。其影響生產，僅决於隄防，然非藉機力，實無可爲力。機力之大小，將因暴雨量之數字及田水位與江水位之差率爲準。例如華陽河流域農田之排水，根據九江歷年之雨量記載，最大暴雨量爲二十年七月二十日至廿九日一次，等於二六四公厘。如田中最大容許積水以二〇〇公厘計，平時留存田間以八〇公厘計，則可暫時積存之雨量爲一二〇公厘。如淹沒水中之稻以四日爲限，繪製排水量圖解圖，得知每日應排水量爲一六公厘，則每平方公里得　又該區田水位與江水位之高差爲四·八公尺，則普通抽水機之效率，約爲百分之六十，故每平方公里所需馬力，約爲廿四，即每畝需馬力〇·〇一三三四。　　以上三者，在流域以內之農田，有完善之設備者，可稱絕無。其有涵閘者，亦屬甚尠，以目前揚子江流域堤垸地農田之一般情况而言，如有完善之設備，使水量適宜，則水稻之生產量，可得百分之三四十之增進。且逐漸可以謀冬作物（小麥）之生產（現以冬季有積潦，故不宜小麥），以麥一石計，則可達五千萬石之鉅。　　又查堤垸之修築，多凌亂無章，漫無標準。大抵事前無具體之計劃其本身旣不足以禦尋常雨量之變動，且於附近區域之水流，蓄洩亦多阻礙。故已成未成堤垸之整理取締，均屬必要，其情形正與都市中取締不合規定之房屋建築相同。在着於整理以前，應即辦理堤垸之測量登記手續，此項工作，極爲繁重，然賓基本之工作也。　　提垸之濱湖及沿支港者，以與江水隔絕，泥沙亦無由灌注。圈築數年之後，堤垸之地依然，而水道湖泊日漸淤高，高下反形懸殊，潰決旣易，修復又難。宣洩內潦，更感困苦。此種情形，在洞庭湖一帶最形顯著。補救之法，厥在按其地勢，辦理放淤地以增高田得加肥　善於此。英方法由堤垸之上游，設置溢口，灌注複射於淤區。被灌之區得以平均增高。淸流仍由下溢口洩注入湖。原有堤防不使冲毀，溝渠不使淤塡。放淤期間過後，仍得有充份之整理時期，以便來年之耕耘。　　如各區堤垸農田個別陸續整理究成，亦即揚子江中下游整個農田水利工程之成功。在各區之中又以洞庭湖中游北岸及漢水下游最爲急要，寶爲楊子江流域農田水利之中心問題焉。前由灌溉管理局創辦，抗戰後，由揚子江水利委員會接辦之太湖附近之龐山湖灌溉區工程有堅固之堤防系統之　渠及統一之電力戽水站實是爲改進堤垸地農田之示範。　　此項提垸地農田之整理工程，欲求大規模之推廣，除政府擇要辦理外，仍應求農民之自動合作，而土地之整理合作社之組織乃屬基本之條件。</p>

<p>春秋	離別淚  張契渠　　慧要去美國，這是一年前在重慶時開始籌劃的。直到三個月前才遂漸具體化。隨着敎育部批准，外交部批准，大使館批准，領到護照，請准外匯……一步步的接近，直至輪船公司把開船日期的通知送來，我們對於送行一事已不十分成覺興趣了。因爲這三個月來，每進一步，便送一决行，夾着過耶誕，過新年，過元宵，順便餞行，已不知請她吃過多少回酒，跳過多少回舞。如今常眞要上船了，也不過吃吃跳跳而已！多沒有意思。　　話別的話，祝頌的話，也已成了濫制。所以當登船的前夕，大家祗是平靜地吃了一頓家常飯，早早的睡覺了，免得第二天出發時慌亂。　　旅行本該如此。把事情看得輕鬆些，八年抗戰，也祗一瞬問事；去美國雖有萬里之遙，然而科學發達的今日，還不及一百年前南京到北京的艱苦。那些臨別依依，兒女作態的人，祗是自己控制不了感情，　竟是自尋煩惱而已。　　慧說：離別有一種奇異的感覺，自然會流下淚來。所以最好大家不要送，糊裏糊塗的，像去一次南京或杭州一樣，讓船開了出去完事。可是我不信，我要送，我有把握控制我自己。淸和郁不知什麼理山，也要堅持着送到船埠。於是我們三人帮她提着箱子，送到了黃浦碼頭。碼頭上，旅客已不少。一隻一萬五千噸大的海輸，緊傍着江岸像一座屏風，中央加着一座橋梯，讓行李和旅客上船去，送客不准上船，都站在下面向船上甲板上的親友招着手。間有一兩個面帶戚容的，但多數是歡愉的。　　當然，那些美國人是回鄕去，應該高興；中國人呢，或是去留學，或是去攷察，或是去會情人，或是去發洋財，更該高興。那些面帶戚容的人，還是自尋煩惱而已。　　淸說：也許今天送行人之中沒有一對是情人。否則，決不會不哭的。　　我不信。　　行李送上了船，慧又下來，告訴我們船艙中的大概情形，又跟我們同到碼頭附近吃薺菜心餛飩。那是道地的中國點心，遠波重洋以後的她將無機會再享受逼種清調了！其價雖廉，其味實原。我們隨便談着吃着笑着，像平常上小館子吃點心一棵。慧雖自認感情比較脆弱，在大家若無其事的歡笑中，也怡然自若了。淸是一向自負剛强，自然也無半點戚容。　　食後，便在點心舖內吸烟聊天，等待時間。時間是個怪東西。假使是個上刑塲的漢奸，對於這二點鐘的時間是多未珍惜呀，他可以儘量的寫遺囑，吟絕命詩，上主席書，發牢騷，罵人；然而我們祗是在輕鬆的閒談中過去了。　　下午二點鈸時，我們重新將她送到船上。這時，送行的人更多了。人叢中，郁首先發現有一個胖胖的外國女人淚痕滿面。面頰上被她的親友兒女親得一塊塊口紅殘跡，非常可笑。因爲船快開了，上了船的，便不再下來，祗是向下面揮手示意。慧也站在田板上，微笑地，用手裏的糖菓向我們拋。　　不久，郁又發現一個穿皮大衣的中國女孩子，獨自站得遠遠底在抹眼淚。　　這時，江風甚大，氣壓頗低，似有下雨模樣。有若干外國孩子在下面跳着呌着，跟他們船上的社母打招呼。有二個外國人在拉手風今，一個在向下面的親友唱歌。有一個外國男人剛剛走到橋板上，又迅速的退到橋堍，另一個外國男人蹤身上去抱住了他的勃子接了個吻。　　外國人寫達感情的方式比中國人强，深可佩服。　　又有一個老太太在擦眼睛了，畢竟是女人。男人，至多像那三個留學生模樣的中國靑年，默默地憑欄相望而已。　　慧的笑容不知在什麼時候收歛了。淸祗是遠遠的獨自行，大的在强自抑制。　　船頭上放出三聲爆竹，似乎是將要啓錠的信號。岸上一陣騷動，船上手中齊舞，舞的多半是外國人。中國人呢，慧的手中拖住了面無法揮動了！淸對着江面，一回兒把眼鏡卸下，一回兒又戴上，不知在忙些什麼。我的心開始有些感覺沉重。但仍然在客觀地看別人的表情，藉以調節我自己的情緒。　　船仍舊未開，雨却當眞下起來了。幸喜不大，牛毛雨，打在臉上，正好掩飾人們的淚痕。有幾個大男人也在用手帕擦臉，不知是擦雨抑是擦淚。但有一個外國老頭兒，因爲他的手中忙着和船上人對揮，無暇擦臉，却被我看出黃豆大的淚珠在往下直滾。　　又過了一回，橋板被水手吊了起來。岸上十多個工人托着，合力將他卸去。轟然一聲，放平在地上。這樣，更表示船要開了。岸上又是一片嘈嚷，上下手中揮舞。在我後面，有六七個外國男子，八九個婦女，十餘個孩子，開始唱一支送行曲。歌聲倒相當嘹亮，祗是聲音有些發抖，而且因爲緩慢的緣故，有點像送葬曲，更覺得悽酸。那些人，一邊唱，一邊揮手，一邊擦淚，一邊用手送吻。　　這歌聲是可惡的，每一個聲音，像在把我拖向離愁中去。我祗能屹然站在船旁，等待那支葬曲的終結。　　雨下得漸漸大起來了，淸和郁也木立在最前排，仰首望看慧，離憑雖祗不到八呎，但一在船上一在岸上，似乎隔着一條天塹。慧一個勁兒哭，先是把臉埋在手中裏，好像怕人笑話似的。後來索性把那哭喪臉露了出來，呆對着岸上，似乎在看着我們，又似乎什麼也沒有瞧見，祗是在出神。　　站在慧身旁的一個中國女孩子，她的親人已回去了，但她仍然憂戚地站在甲板上，用淚眼望着行將離別的祖國大地；在慧的左邊的那三個面有憂色的中國留學生，也把手中向下面揮了一下，不知是爲風大而怕傷風呢，還是怕雨水打濕了面孔，祗見他們揮一下手中，便擦兩决鼻子，細看他們的視綫方向，才知通下面正好也有三位女客在陪他們擦鼻子。　　哭的人顯然多起來了。老的少的，男的女的，外國人山國人都有。也有人在笑，但那種笑也許比哭更含深意。惟有我，我能控制自已。我在和這離愁別恨的氣氛搏鬥，在和這葬曲似的送行曲抵抗，在和慧的淚眼對視，我要在這哭的洪濤中屹立不動，給哭一個申斥！　　爲什麼要哭呢？人旣然自已安排了命運，便應該勇敢地接受這事實。哭，是懦怯的，是矛盾的！　　嘩啦一聲，船　解開了！岸上船上同時發生春當似的顫動的一聲歡（？）呼最高層的甲板上，兩個外國人又在冒着雨拉起手風琴來，二層甲板上的外國人和岸上的親友齊聲唱着一支雄壯的送別歌。先前那一組唱送行曲的，至此唱得更起勁，聲音更顫動，像在敎堂中祈禱，船上一個老神甫也把手中遲鈍地向下面揮着。　　忽然船上的汽笛吼了一聲，那聲音是像沉重的炸彈墮落在江心，又像空谷的迥響，隆隆地在我心上猛然轟擊了一下。我有些支不住了。原先緊靠着碼頭的船身，至此已裂開了一條縫，那條縫。像象徵着人生的缺憾，這缺憾逐漸逐漸在擴大，擴大，船上人把半個身子探在欄干上，也不顧下面洶湧可的江水，祗是拼命的向岸上搖着手中，岸上的送客，像追趕一個失去的幻夢似的，一步步的向前走去。忘記了上面的雨水，下面的泥濘，身上早已打濕了的大衣，手中被淚水鼻水弄髒了的手中，祗是揮呀！呌呀！珍惜着這最後一秒鐘！　　又是一聲汽笛！我的心又一震。　　這一聲像一個壯士的長歎，表示堅決決的離開此塊土地了！原光旅客和送行者相距甚近，不過像一個人俯在樓窗上，一個人站在樓底下。如今，像一塊土地突然分成了兩槐，一塊被遺棄在這裏，而另一塊則海闊天涯去到另一個世界了。　　三個月來，雖然天天在說送行，天天在話別，畢竟生活在一起，無論怎樣想像，總不能眞切體會到離別後的情味。惟有這一聲汽笛，一曲　歌，加以擺在眼前的船身漸漸的離開江岸的事實，使人深切的覺得「離別了」。　　船像一個不晝顧的出征軍人，揚長地往吳淞而去。我原先祗注視着　手中的手中，我自己呢，也在拚命的搖給她看，可是現在船愈去愈遠，單獨的目標已無法分辦，祗好向整個的　亂揮一陣，再揮下去更無意思，於是我們三人像去了一件件麼市西，大家低下了頭，虛空地綫慢地離開了碼頭，走到馬路上時，才想起自己臉上有許多濕膩的東西，不管他是淚跡是雨水？總該將他擦一下吧！免得被人認出我們是才從碼頭送行回來。今日的文人往那裏走？  胡山湖　　看看報上的記載，聽聽出版界的消息，今日以寫文爲其主要工作的人，似乎巳經走到了山窮水盡的絕地，不見得就會有柳暗花明的奇境出現　　爲了節省外匯，報紙减少篇幅；篇幅少，新聞與廣告不能不維持原狀，首先遭到犧牲的自然是與文人相依爲命的各種副刊和各欄專稿。　　印刷成本飛漲，銷路並沒有把握，定期刊與單行本，儘量在收縮，减少，出版商說，只有白紙是值錢的，一印了字，就不值錢；又說，關了門坐吃，倒比開了門做生意容易過日子。　　文人中，有些識時務的俊傑，早就不幹這寫文一行，有的從政，雖語公務員的待遇不高，却大小總是一個官，人人都喜做官，其中必有道理，總比一無生路的文人好。有的經商，從頭學起生意經來，在上海生活享用最豪華的，還不是商麼？有產業的，乾脆閉門家居，封筆大吉。　　當然也有不做官，不經商，並無恒產的，而也能够活得下，並且活得很好的文人。但這種文人並不多，我們不能以少數來槪括多數，說文人到底還有這樣一條好出路。　　改行的，離棄了文人的本位，已非文人；不改行而以文人的面目和政客的姿態出現的，其實也已經離開文人的據點，也不好算文人。因此，今日的文人，內受精神無處發揮的苦悶，外遭生活艱難的壓退，就只在死亡綫上掙扎着，沒有出路！　　今日的文人往那裏走？也許正是大家所關心的問題吧！　　但天無絕人之路！誰說今日的文人便無路可走呢？除了改行或半改行以外，到底還是有可走之路的！　　要解除生活的壓逼，我以爲並不難，憑我在抗戰期間的經騐看來。消極的，减低生活的需要，實行節流；積極的，多做與本行不悖的額外工作，實行開源。我家在抗戰期間，最困難時，我寄食在一個錢莊裏，家裏的人以粥爲主食，而我則兼敎四個大學二個夜校的書，每期上課三十九節。我們一家居然這樣應付過來了。　　要解除精神的苦悶，我以爲尤其容易。文章不能發表，僅可積起來，本來應時而不能持久的文章是沒有多大的價值的。不寫文章也可以作寫文章的準備：老練的作家可以藉此收集材料，靑年的作家可以藉此多多學習。此外，還有一件最有意義而也最愉快的工作可以做，那就是敎育下一代。　　年長的文人，常然不必以老作家自命，倚老賣老；但本着自己的經騐，知識，誠懇地，平心靜氣地，指導着那些未成熱的，有志上進的靑年，實在是很應該的。時仳雖然如此壞，但我們自己還要準備我們在文化上再出發，何况年輕的下一代呢！我們應該看得遠些，不要忘了他們。當然不指導時也不能有什麼偏見，以致摧殘了這有爲的下一代。　　「得天下英才而教育之」，因此敎育下一代，也實在是最愉快的一件事。　　以上是我就文人的本身着想，所以那樣說。對於改行或半改行的，我只有希望，希望他們也能夠回到文人的木位上來，我並不敢諷刺，更不敢辱罵，還請改行的文人不要誤會。　　這是一個很嚴重的時代，凡爲文人者，不論現任文人或過去文人（已改行的文人），都應該好好地爲自己，爲私人找尋一條出路，諷刺或辱罵都是用不着的。　　今日的文人往那裏走？我願意在這意拋磚引玉地徵求更寶貴的答案。與元直應心海之約，小敘沙利文，忽有所覩，惘然賦此，調寄鴣天。  玉狸　　照影驚鴻隔座春，眼前人是去年人，比肩蜜語嬌無限，蕩漾銀燈特地親。尋舊夢，夢如塵，變箋千壘悔留痕；烟簑何日西湖去，懺盡心苗愛與嗔！和玉貍原韻  冠亞　　夢斷銀屏黯不春，水流花謝悄無人，魂銷寶樹尊前醫，望徹蓬山別後親。蓮作寸，麝成塵，枉拋淸淚涴新痕，誰憐玉笑珠香日，竟卜今朝愛變嗔！　　風景　法·郁特利羅　上海美專學生助學會世界名畫展覽會出口一寸山河一寸血　180  葉勁風　　「有辦法把這位萍子小姐弄來嗎？」w君問。　　「也許那個娘兒們就是她……小姨？」虎城居然也開口了。我想我們現在討論的題目，他有些明白；而且還是一個當局不迷的人；所以一下會想到那個威脅w君這所秘密機關的女子.　　「就是不在這裏，也可以試試！」我忽然又補上了這麼一句。　　「哦！」鶴見明白了。　　「可是？……耀羣也似乎知道我在搗什麼鬼。　　「對了，」我覺得他們剛才那一翻驚怪，有些好笑，「以其道還治其人……可是這也是沒有辦法的辦法，不能十分有把握。」　　這裏只有兩個人，也許還不明白我的辦沙，一位是w君，他同我認識之後，時間不多，也沒有工夫談到我的生平；所以並不知道我有此一什麼鬼把戲。還有虎臣，一者年幼，學識欠缺了些；一者前一天因爲一個偶然的機會，耀業同我討諭諜探技術問題，她說從前跟着那位外國老師，學過初步應用心理，懂得一些催眼術，可惜沒有工夫練習等等。可是我勸她放葉這一條；因爲這東西不像其他科學，除了理論與設計外，其他實施，都在物質上。這東西的主體賓施，完全在精神方面；說得神秘些，完全是一種「心電」作用。這種心電的控制，就如拳技一般，需要多年的磨煉，多年的修養才有幾分把握。而且個人的秉賦，與這種修養，適宜不適宜，還有很大的問題。我同耀羣討論這個問題的時候，虎臣並不在一起，所以他也根本不知道。　　我勸耀羣放棄這東西的時候，她有此懷疑，我只好把自己學習，實騐，修養，種種的經過，說了一此給他聽，她這才相信了。所以今天一聽到我說出那句「有辦法」的當口，她的思想如此敏捷，常然一猜便中。　　「可以辦嗎？」耀羣把一雙翠眉擴一起，似乎在追憶她從前所學這門功課的內容了。　　「大的可以辦，」我對他點點頭。又把我同她這一問一答的題目，簡單幾句，告訴了w君和虎臣，省得他們悶在鼓裏。　　「我似乎記得有一種「隔地暗示』的方式……」耀羣正在搜索自己的記憶。　　「差不多了。」我鼓勵她說下去。　　「……可是隔地暗示，需要這個對象，曾經受過一兩次暗示之後，才能實行特績傳導，不是嗎？這位萍子小姐，您連她多大多高都不知道？……」　　「不，沒有很大的關係，我們可以用過渡方法，間接傳導……」我正待把我計劃的方法，發表出來；因這時w君和鶴見以及虎城等，都迫不及待地希望我把所有計劃，一頓說明出來；尤其是鴻見，看我這般好整以暇似的，同耀羣研究學問，大有恨不得給我一槍的樣子，無奈耀羣又打斷了我的話：　　「間接傳導也得有適當的煤介才行。不是嗎？」　　「對的，我們這裏不是有着一個現成的媒介嗎？」我瞧了鶴見一眼，「古君不就是一座現成的過渡橋樑？……只要我把一些簡單的「自己催眠」方式，說給鶴見兄，讓他實騐起來，我再從旁葉中我的心電來補助……希望能夠接通心電，事情就好辦了。」藝文壇  華　　于在春張駿祥主編之「水準文藝週刋」，業巳付排，內容有米光潛·袁水拍·魏金枝等人之譯作，預定三月一日出版。　　田漢五十大籌，電影戲劇界熱烈慶祝。　　上海劇藝社與「光華」之合同勢難繼續，因前台要求包底過高，（電影未加價前數爲六百萬元，加價後需倍之）故「上劇」將無用武之地，不日即翻演「裙帶風』，向觀衆作告別式演出。　　袁雪芬有東山再起說。　　「將軍」盛家倫監命自東北來，爲時數月，（一度赴港訂購器材）吃遍上海，遇人即日：「物事好吃格」。　　費穆率領外景隊赴蘇，奈今歲春寒，桃花化未開，此行一無收穫，現巳返滬，據云「錦繡江山」預定究成之時間將再延長爲一年。　　「黃金」周信芳（麒麟童）預告不日上演「文天祥」，正加緊排演中。　　耿震在後方時有一戀人，該女已羅敷有夫，唯其夫留美多年查無音信，不料新近鍍金歸來，夫婦重修舊好，老耿落空，大爲「黯然』　　何學初夫婦在鄕療養數月，返來經X光透視，肺部已非常淸朗，友朋皆爲之慶幸不止。　　蔣君超由港啓程來滬，接洽藍馬等赴港拍片事宜。「郎心如鐵』中之男女主角却爾斯飽郁與殷格蘭褒曼自由談	貝多芬的樂曲　離開你更遼遠了！  薇　　論市上收音機價格的轉換　　你願意聽一曲貝多芬的交響樂麼？　　你願意聽一支平克勞斯貝的低音日情歌麼？　　你願聽一支好萊塢的爵士音樂麼？　　我相信，你會的。當你靜靜地在昏黃的燈前，你一定願意打開你手頭的無綫電收音機，桃選你一個歡喜則電台，傾聽一下你心愛的歌曲，使你煩燥的心神，得以浸沉在醇厚，甜蜜，溫馨的歌曲裏的。　　但是，這一種生活上享受，精神上的滋養，現在爲着生活的沉重，我們已經失去那僅有的聊可自慰的機會了。（雖然，我所說的，還僅限於中層階級，一般人哪談得到？）　　無綫電收音體，在戰前，本來是件貴族式的娛樂品，一隻好一點的收音機，總要在四五十元到一百元左右。而到抗戰勝利以後，收音機的價格，反而比戰前便宜很多。自然，戰前那些RCA飛利浦牌子的收音機，現在反而買不到，而市上作爲商店招徠用的收音機，大部份都是美國戰後的新出品。這些收音機都是難牌，名堂多得很，大的都是樣品居多，價格大的每隻十五六萬元到廿萬左右，表面沒有方棚，也有四五個眞空管，可是有兩個毛病廿：第一，燈絲容易燒壞，大抵最多不過一年壽命，第二，許多小型收音機，壞了也無法修理，因爲上海還沒有這些新感器的零件，你到那兒去修理？　　美國所以要製造這一批樣品式的收音機向山國傾銷，原因很簡單，第一，如若先把好的收音機賣出來，將來這些材料簡單，眞空管壽命短促的收音機誰要？　　假如這批樣品收音機的壽命是一年的時間，那麼麼後來一批比較好的收音機，便可跟踪而上。　　市上那些類似Air　King牌子的收音機，於是風魔一時，因爲只化十五六萬到廿萬左右，你案頭就可以有一架聲音並不太壞的收音機，使你多少可以滿足一　下你對收音機廣播節目的慾望，這未始非一件愉快的事情。　　但是，經過了這次金潮，外匯調整以後，市上的收音機的價格，便大大的波動了。　　過去一隻廿萬左右的小型收音機，現在要賣五六十萬元，一跳就跳了三倍！　　一種新到的飛利浦長短波收音機，要漲到一倍以上。　　一切材料如卅八號綫，聽筒，眞空管和一切無綫電零件，平均都加了三倍的價錢。　　那就是說，一隻以三千三百元外匯定的收音機，現在得以一萬二千元來結匯了。　　收音機在這個轉換期間，一跳就跳到三倍價格的寶座上。　　一付五燈的眞空管，從前只要七八萬元，現在要廿多萬元，從前一隻德律風根的聽筒，只四五萬元，現在要十餘萬元。　　音樂，和一切你所感到興趣的廣播節目，離開你的生活更篷遠，更無法接觸了。　　假如你生活光感到十分威脅的時候，你還有餘裕，去購置一隻五六十萬，一百餘萬元一隻的收音機麼？　　這是近乎夢想的了。　　最近市上有一種袖珍收音機，用天地錢，（大的是用礦石裝置的）要賣十二萬元，但是聲音小透小透，對於廣播有迷的人，一定不會感到滿足的，是不是？紅遍影壇的殷格蘭褒曼  果華　　瑞典　是出大名星的地方，前有嘉賓，後有殷格蘭褒曼，而褒曼的成功，且凌駕嘉賓而上，上海一般觀衆之認識褒曼，第一張片十是「卡薩布蘭嘉」，第二張是「聖瑪麗亞之鐘聲」，第二張當是即將在大華上映的「郎心如鐵」了。據美國「萬麗」雜誌載稱：去年（一九四六）好萊塢有十九張影片，賣座奇佳，每片租金都有四百萬美金左右。其中褒曼一個人就有四張，共收入二千一百七十五萬之巨。其次是平克勞斯貝，他所攝各片租金收入共有一千八百萬，在十九張影片之中，第一張賺錢的自然是褒曼與平克勞斯貝合演的「聖瑪麗亞之鐘聲」了。褒曼在「郎心如鐵』中另一鏡頭談「吸血鬼」  麥葉　　殷格蘭褒曼同時也在百老匯舞台上出現，她的「聖女貞德」便她與貞德一樣獲得了空前的勝利，將百老匯征服了。據「生活」畫報的報導說，祗要褒曼肯演下去，這齣戲便永遠可以賣座不衰，由這一點看，褒曼之紅遍影劇界是可以想見的了。　　這月初，法國凡爾賽城發生了一件名符其實的「駭人新聞」：這美麗的城市附近，發現了一個來去無蹤的「吸血鬼」，前後數次襲擊女性，光剝光她們的衣服，隨即咬遍她們整個身體，吮吸人血，致人生命危殆。最新的一條電報說，這「鬼」已被捕。將來審訊主案經過，怕比第一流的偵探小說，最賣座的恐怖電影還要轟動。　　電報說得很簡略，但已有足夠材料，給我們判定這「鬼」不過是一個男的變態性慾者。筆者相信這犯人必會受到心理學專家用科學的方法來鑑定腦子有無手病，也很有可能將來受判罪非常輕，甚至輕得無罪，旣不送去監囚牢，也不致受絞刑，但總要去神經病院住一番。　　十入世紀下半葉，法國有一個名斗沙特（M.Sace）的侯爵，寫過許多冊小說，所描寫男主人翁，總是喜歡用種種殘忍的方法於女人身上，而男主角自己就變態地獲得性的滿足。他之鞭韃她，目的不外乎追求性的刺激，而鞭韃到最兇處，他就獲到性的亢進，其間不管她的呼喊，痛楚，抽因，……無一不可以助長他性慾烈燄。這顯然是一種變態的行爲。後來人們曉得了，小說裏男主角不過是作者的化身，他本人也有這種變態性慾。所以他的名字後來就索性的變爲這種一人盧己樂」的變態性行爲的招牌，即所謂「Ssdism」是也，通常我們譯作「殘虐狂」，「施虐狂」，「施虐　」等等。　　至於行兇前定必剝光女人的全身衣服，其動機怕屬於變態性行爲一個表現的居多，而不僅是作爲咬嚙妙們全身的先一步進備而已。我們很容易推測到，女人被一個暴徒強迫剝光衣服時的掙扎抗拒，和突然受到這番襲擊而在情緒上所表現出的震撼驚駭，在施虐者限中，正是無上的「性刺激」或许，追求這此刺激就是他兇行的目的。「生活」雜誌　要漲價了  華　　好多時以前，要想定閱一份「航業文摘」（Shipping　Digest)，去問東亞書店，職員告訴我一年需美金六七元（我記不淸了），合法幣兩一萬多。悔我当時不該猶豫，因循直到現在。前天去問，要法幣九萬元以上。先前是爲兩萬多而躊躇，現在是爲九萬多而祗能望「洋」興嘆了。不能定雜誌，祗能買一本什麼看看吧，我買了一本「生活」畫報。十二月廿三日的國際版，曾經漲價，現在又跌爲一千五百元，使我買的時候，好像塌了什麼便宣貨的快活，之後又買一本一月廿七日的『時代』，却不折不扣要我四千塊錢。職員答覆我的問話道：『這是新的「時代」，等新的「生活」來的時候，自然也要漲價！」我買來以後，在斗室中披閱，覺得這份「精神食糧」，實在己成爲奢侈品，不是我們這全國　俄的國民所能享受的了。　　寫到此處，書架上傳來吱吱的老鼠聲，彷彿在對我說：「本來嘛，你穿的是稀破爛舊的衣服，你住的是骯臟而年久失修的房屋，你是一個二千年古國的小民，……」　　我祗能擱筆了。搶救神童　「無題有感」之一  孟龍　　偶爾看到一條花邊新聞，說是廣西民間曾哄傳榴江發現新神童一名，前年還只三歲，已經能哼一草綠江南萬里靑，殺敵日本回南京」之句，其時敵勢尚猖獗，想不到那年夏秋之交，日本果如這位小詩人所預言：日本被打倒了，於是就認他爲神童。　　據說這位神童，相貌方面，除前腦凸出以外，跟平常的孩子一樣，沒有什麼特徵，有一個共通點是：跟別的廣西孩子一樣在吃草根樹皮過悲慘的日子，一點兒沒有營養，所以體質衰弱得很。　　引起筆者好奇的，不在神童的詩，而在這段新聞後面的一條尾巴，它說：希望政府應該設法設法敎養神童，將來或能成爲國家的一個特殊人才。　　我想：神童是否稱得上「神」，神童的舊詩是否另有捉刀人在，姑置不談，僅僅就事論事龍。神童跟平常孩子原是一樣的人，倘不給以營養，即使幸而不死，其「前腦凸出」的部分，必愈形凸出，即使幸而給以營養了，而在敎養上還是哼哼「草綠江南萬里靑」一類的撈什子，充其量也只能造成一個未來的舊詩壇上的怪物而已，——也許這就是所謂「特殊人才」嗎？　　我看，這也未必。「草綠江南萬里靑」，雖不能說它不是詩句，然而這樣的詩句，在成人們看來，也已經夠「傷腦筋」，眞正是「一之爲甚，其可再乎」？我怕，這樣哼下公，其命運至多以「神童」始，而且以「神童」終——何以故？曰早熟早夭之故也。　　總之一句話：與其救一個「特殊人才」，倒不如救千千萬萬個平平常常的孩子！影譚朗心如鐵  流　　爲着兩個著名的演員，却爾斯鮑郁和殷格關褒曼的號召，相信它是爲觀衆所珍視的作品。　　但是，爲着內容本身的空虛，它雖然炫奇，雖然塗上了神秘的色澤，但它底評價，幷不能超越過最近一致稱頌的「居禮夫人」。　　「居禮夫人」雖然只是一張科學的傳記影片，但它有內容，有啟示性，而加之形式完整，它應該得到它應有的榮譽。　　「郎心如鐵」則不然，它內容只是叙述一個變態心理的丈夫，準備謀殺他妻子的一段故事。在內容上，它是架空的，加之故事發展，也幷不够嚴密完整，因之，全片的組織，就現得不很入理。比如那年靑警員的貿然關入女主角的內室，而馬上掀開全劇的秘密，這是不很聰明的。　　導演喬治可克，雖是名家，（他曾導演「鑄情」等片）但限於故事的限制，不能儘量發揮，這是極可惜的。　　不過，大部份的氣氛，導演都能把握，開始的溫馨，迷霧，煤氣的街燈等，都極强固。　　褒曼及鮑郁的演技，極優秀純熱，確可一看。</p>

<h3>National Army Encircles the Yimeng Mountains, Fierce Fighting Underway in Central Shandong, Communist Forces Attacking Jiaoji Railway Driven Back</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 21st] National forces in Shandong Province are currently advancing from Linyi, Yi County, Yanzhou, and north of Mengyin in multiple directions, adopting a large encirclement strategy against the Communist forces in the Yimeng Mountains. The Communist forces in the Yimeng Mountains are estimated to number over 20,000, with their main force still concentrated in the Feixian and Sishui area. Liu Bocheng's First and Second Columns in western Shandong have retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River, with the majority of their main force still in the area north of Yuncheng and Juye. Communist forces in central Shandong are frequently moving, and the National Army is attacking Xintai and Laiwu.</p>
<p>[Three Newspaper's Xuzhou Dispatch on the 21st] Approximately 30,000 remnants of Chen Yi's forces launched fierce attacks on Laiwu and Xintai in multiple columns on the evening of the 20th. The National Army is fighting bravely to intercept them, and the battle is currently underway. Military sources claim that these Communist forces are making a last-ditch effort and will be completely defeated within days. Additionally, about 50,000 to 60,000 remnants of Chen Yi's forces are currently concentrated in Sishui. If the National Army directly attacks Sishui, the Communist forces may flee north across the Yellow River. Reports that the main force of Chen Yi's remnants are concentrated in Rizhao are inaccurate.

<h3>Elite Troops from Chahar Arrive in Beiping, National Army Advances Towards Mancheng, Over 3,000 Communist Forces in Eastern Hebei Surrender</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] Under the unified command of the Eleventh and Twelfth War Zones in the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, joint operations are becoming increasingly close. Yesterday, another powerful unit arrived in Beiping from Chahar. This unit was originally intended to reinforce the Xushui Campaign, but now that the campaign has ended victoriously, it is stationed in Beiping on standby. The military strength in the Beiping area is currently unprecedented. The Commander's Office specifically mentions this to dispel various rumors.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] The offensive and defensive battles near Mancheng, west of Baoding on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, have intensified. After the Xushui Campaign, part of the National Army's forces reinforced the Mancheng area. The fighting in this area has been stalemated for over a week. The Communist forces are doing their best to defend to the death, and the fighting is extremely fierce. Communist forces who have broken into smaller units are also actively attacking various stations between Ping and Bao. Last night, Songlin Store, Yongle, Liulihe, and even Xiaogouqiao in the suburbs of Beiping were all attacked by Communist forces on National Army outposts, and were repelled. Only Changqing Town, 20 miles west of Liulihe, is still under siege by over 2,000 Communist forces. Reinforcements will arrive tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch on the 21st] Fierce battles continue in the Suicheng Qicun area of Xushui and Mancheng Counties.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] After the Xushui Campaign, the main remnants of the Communist forces mostly infiltrated the Taihang Mountains to reorganize. One unit fled to Baiyangdian east of Baoding, and another brigade fled to the north bank of the Yongding River south of Beiping. Small battles still occur near Xushui. Song Kentang, a staff officer of the Eleventh War Zone, came to Beiping after the campaign to report to Sun Lianzhong, and returned to Baozhen on the morning of the 22nd. Traffic on Pingbaoding will resume on the 24th. This decision requires emergency repairs with 12,000 shared sleepers.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] Clearing the Pinghan Line is a necessity after the Jinpu Line, according to military experts. They say that restoring traffic to Baoding and Shijiazhuang is not difficult because the main force of the Communist forces has left this section, but this is not necessary. The Xushui Campaign proves that the National Army's change of tactics against the Communist forces has been quite successful, that is, it is not necessary to defend unnecessary strongholds to the death or automatically abandon them, and to concentrate the main force to pursue and annihilate the main force of the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Baoding Dispatch on the 21st] The Communist forces that previously harassed eastern Hebei have had their main force largely destroyed after being pursued and suppressed by the National Army.

In addition to saying that he had to ask for instructions, the Soviet commander stated that the importance of the Wazi Store was not specified when the agreement was signed, seemingly indicating a long-term intention to occupy it.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 21st] The Communist forces are increasing and expanding three military forces. It is now learned that there are no problems with the weapons of these three armies.

<h3>Gold Deposits in Hong Kong Banks Reach US$7 Million, Gold Has Nowhere to Go, Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong Dispatch on the 21st] It is known that there are gold bars worth more than US$7 million currently stored in the vaults of various banks, but since the Chinese government promoted strict economic measures that prohibited gold trading, importing the gold bars into China has become unprofitable. Banks estimate that a total of US$10 million in gold arrived from the United States and Mexico last month, but now this has ceased because the Hong Kong government no longer issues import licenses. The current price of gold in Hong Kong is HK$270 per tael, which is lower than its import cost. If China continues to ban gold trading, these merchants will lose heavily. Although the price of gold in India is higher than in Hong Kong, both the Indian and Hong Kong governments do not issue import and export licenses.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Measures for Price Evaluation and Implementation have been approved for implementation by the Supreme National Defense Council at its 220th regular meeting on the 20th.

<p>Price Evaluation Councils to be Established in Important Locations</p>
<p>(1) In all important locations nationwide where price evaluation is necessary, the Executive Yuan shall separately order the establishment of Price Evaluation Councils. (2) The responsibilities of the Price Evaluation Councils are as follows: (A) To evaluate the selling prices of essential daily necessities for the people; (B) To assist in reporting violations of negotiated prices.

(5) Price evaluation shall be divided into initial evaluation and re-evaluation. (6) The initial evaluation shall be conducted by personnel from the relevant bureau or section and representatives from the relevant trade associations for the goods being negotiated. After the price negotiation, a report shall be submitted to the Chairman of the Price Evaluation Council. The Chairman may approve and implement it in advance if deemed appropriate or if prompt handling is necessary, and then report it to the Price Evaluation Council. (7) Re-evaluation shall be conducted by convening all members of the Price Evaluation Council when the Chairman of the Price Evaluation Council deems the negotiated price inappropriate or when one-third or more of the members request it after the initial evaluation. The prices of goods determined by the aforementioned re-evaluation shall be submitted by the Price Evaluation Council to the head of the local government for approval. (8) The goods subject to price negotiation shall be limited to essential daily necessities for the people, excluding edible salt. The types shall be designated and publicly announced by the local government based on local conditions. (9) The standard for price negotiation shall be based on the cost of the goods, with appropriate profit margins added separately based on local industry practices. (10) The calculation of the cost of goods may include, in addition to the manufacturing cost or the original purchase price, interest (not exceeding the loan interest rate agreed upon by local silver and money exchanges), taxes, transportation costs, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance premiums, and depreciation. (11) The prices of various goods that have been evaluated and approved shall be publicly announced by the local government and reported to the competent authorities for record. (12) Shops selling price-evaluated goods must mark the approved price standards in front of the store or on each item, and the selling price must not exceed the approved price.</p>
<p>Re-Evaluation When Costs Fluctuate</p>
<p>(13) When the cost of goods fluctuates dramatically, and there is a need to evaluate a new price, the price may be re-negotiated, but the price may not be increased before it has been negotiated and approved. (14) If local governments deem it necessary to negotiate prices for businesses related to the daily lives of the people, such as hotels, bathhouses, and barbershops, the provisions of these measures shall apply. (15) Those who violate the approved negotiated prices shall be punished in accordance with the Regulations for the Suppression of Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices.</p>

<h3>Relief Funds Changed to Purchase Cotton Cloth UNRRA Agrees to Our Proposal Rumor that Rooks Has Instructed Shanghai Branch to Draft Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, today requested the Central Committee of UNRRA to immediately consider measures to assist China. Authoritative sources have learned that UNRRA has not taken any action on China's request to increase cotton and other major consumer goods in place of the originally planned durable industrial facilities.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] It has been learned from reliable sources that senior UNRRA officials strongly support China's proposal to make cotton cloth worth $49 million and sell it on the open market. At today's extraordinary meeting of the UNRRA Nine-Nation Central Committee, Director Rooks strongly advocated using $49 million in relief funds to trade for cotton and supply it to China. According to reliable UNRRA sources, Rooks has sent a telegram to the UNRRA China Branch in Shanghai, instructing it to prepare a detailed plan. After receiving a reply in early next week, it will be submitted to the Central Committee for discussion and action. It is expected that although this matter arose from the appeal of Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun, calling it "practical and psychological assistance to China's current situation," Rooks will personally take charge of this matter. Other well-informed sources say that UNRRA had prepared $19 million to purchase medical supplies to assist China, but Ambassador Gu Weijun's appeal strongly stated that China is an agricultural country, and what farmers urgently need is cloth. If they can purchase this item at a reasonable price, they are willing to sell agricultural products cheaply. Therefore, assisting China with cotton is a great help to the country. Rooks also said that the Chinese authorities have suggested that 10% of these cotton assistance supplies can be used to relieve the poor, and 5% can be used to sew cotton clothes. It is also learned that UNRRA materials have been sold in China and other countries, and the proceeds have been transferred to the headquarters and used as relief funds.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] It is expected here that UNRRA will soon approve China's cotton purchase plan. Before approval, the UNRRA Central Committee is awaiting a formal guarantee from the Chinese government that the cotton purchase plan it proposed is truly for the welfare of Chinese farmers and not for enriching black market speculators.</p>
<p>Associated Press Releases Inaccurate News Executive Yuan Relief Administration Will Protest to Egerton</p>

The article stated: "It is based on the opinions of senior officials of the UNRRA office in China," but the names were not published. In addition to criticizing the Chinese government's handling of UNRRA materials, there were also many absurd attacks on Chairman Chiang. Executive Yuan Relief Administration personnel were very angry at UNRRA personnel for violating discipline and speaking arbitrarily. It has now been decided to ask Director Huo to protest to UNRRA General Egerton on two points: (1) Investigate the speaker mentioned by the Associated Press. If UNRRA personnel cannot be found, the Associated Press should be held accountable. If it is fabricated by the Associated Press, please ask the agency to issue a responsible statement: (2) The UNRRA office in China should issue an official statement denying this immediately. If UNRRA does not respond within days, Executive Yuan Relief Administration staff will jointly sign a protest to clarify the truth.</p>

Before boarding the plane, Mr. Yeh made a statement saying, "The efforts made by the Military Mediation Department under the leadership of General Gillem and Marshal Marshall for peace in China over the past year, I believe, will definitely not be in vain. I believe peace in China will arrive before long." Yeh also shouted the slogans "Long live Sino-American friendship!" and "Long live the united Chinese people!" after reviewing the U.S. military honor guard for the last time. His planned statement on the conclusion of the Military Mediation Department was not released before boarding the plane, and he cautiously avoided the simple questions posed by reporters. Those flying to Yan'an with him today included Xue Zizheng, Huang Hua, Xu Bing, and twenty others, including an American woman suffering from lung disease and her five-year-old daughter, "Niu Niu". Yeh and his party arrived at Xiyuan Airport at 7:05 a.m. Gillem, Cai Wenzhi, and American and government officials above the rank of section chief, including Mr. Mann, all came to the airport to see them off.

Only a copy of "Seeing and Hearing" magazine with a picture of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng on the cover was left on Mr. Yeh's desk. Perhaps this Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army also had a special interest in General Chen Cheng and was studying him?</p>

<h3>The Issue of Gold Jewelry Sales in Silver Shops</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the emergency measures to ban speculative gold trading, the response from all parties has been good, according to reports over the past few days. However, the second item of the Economic Emergency Measures Program, regarding the crackdown on speculative trading to stabilize the financial market, included the "Measures for Cracking Down on Speculative Gold Trading," which stipulates in Article 1 that "the buying and selling of gold bars and gold jewelry is prohibited, and violators will be confiscated." As a result, the silver shops and jewelry stores in Beijing and Shanghai are all in a state of closure. Representatives of the Shanghai Silver Shops Association have been holding meetings for days to petition and have submitted four suggestions to the government, awaiting the government's announcement of measures to handle the gold jewelry manufactured by silver shops and jewelry stores. If the interpretation of Article 1 of the "Measures for Cracking Down on Speculative Gold Trading" is followed, then the buying and selling of gold jewelry by silver shops and jewelry stores is also illegal. If business operators do not abide by the law and are cracked down, and stop their buying and selling activities, the gold jewelry they have already manufactured must also be confiscated. If this is the case, then the entire silver jewelry industry in the country will be suspended under the gold rush, and some skilled workers will be forced into unemployment, adding another disaster to the turbulent society.</p>
<p>Prohibiting the buying and selling of gold and preventing gold from being the target of speculation is something that gold-producing countries and countries with the most gold reserves have long had control measures for. However, prohibiting the people from using gold as clothing is an unprecedented example, rarely seen in the world. Our country's policy of prohibiting the buying and selling and free circulation of gold this time is originally a wise policy, but because it was completed in a hurry technically, it also included the buying and selling of gold jewelry, and violators will be confiscated. However, there should be reasonable arrangements for the gold jewelry manufactured by silver shops and jewelry stores, so Article 9 of the "Measures for Cracking Down on Speculative Gold Trading" stipulates that other measures will be formulated separately, which is clearly authorizing the Ministry of Finance to provide administrative relief. Then, the Ministry of Finance should quickly formulate these measures to calm people's hearts.</p>
<p>Now, the measures for handling gold jewelry in silver shops and jewelry stores as stipulated in Article 9 of the measures have been announced by the Ministry of Finance yesterday. The provisions of these measures obviously have many loopholes and are worthy of further consideration. Article 2 stipulates that the manufactured gold jewelry must be registered with the competent authority, and the registered gold jewelry should be sold within three months after the announcement of these measures. Article 3 stipulates that the registered gold jewelry that has not been sold after the three-month period should be exchanged for national currency at the local central bank. What we don't understand about these provisions is: (1) Does this mean that the silver jewelry industry will not be allowed to continue to exist after the three-month period? (2) The price at which the central bank dumped gold on February 12 was 7.3 million yuan, 5.62 million yuan on February 9, and 5.72 million yuan on February 8. On February 18, after the National Government promulgated the Economic Emergency Measures, the central bank reset the gold price to 4.8 million yuan. 7.2 million yuan, 5.62 million yuan, and 5.72 million yuan were all the prices at which the central bank dumped gold, and now silver jewelry stores are required to sell it to the central bank for 4.8 million yuan. Isn't this transfer causing silver jewelry stores to suffer significant losses? This provision does not make sense in terms of reason and sentiment. Furthermore, if silver jewelry stores sell all the manufactured gold jewelry, they will definitely not have any gold left to make gold jewelry. The previous measures only have provisions for silver shops to sell their gold jewelry to the central bank, but there are no provisions for how silver jewelry stores should obtain gold to make gold jewelry. This one-sided approach really seems ill-considered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, looking at the overall picture of these measures, the announcement of these measures seems to be facilitating people with gold bars to exchange their gold bars for gold jewelry. If people don't have gold bars, how can they make gold jewelry from the original gold and "entrust" it to silver jewelry stores? The result of the implementation of these measures is not only the danger that the entire silver jewelry industry will go bankrupt, but also the destruction of the general public's habit of using the surplus funds earned from hard work to purchase gold jewelry as savings. As a result, not only will hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs, but it will also destroy a virtue of the people.</p>
<p>Every administrative measure inevitably has both advantages and disadvantages. The government should theoretically have some kind of administrative relief for the affected parts. Regarding the issue of prohibiting the sale of gold jewelry in silver shops, what kind of relief should be given? We believe that the four suggestions of the Shanghai Silver Shops Association: (1) The weight of each piece of jewelry manufactured and sold by silver shops should not exceed two taels on the customs scale, and small bars should not be melted and sold; (2) It is requested to allow the receipt and exchange of gold jewelry, and the price should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central bank; (3) The gold jewelry received and exchanged, in addition to being used for melting and manufacturing jewelry, the surplus should be sold to the central bank, and if it is insufficient, the central bank should be requested to replenish the quantity sold; (4) The operating profit should be determined by the Silver Shops Association with reference to the operating conditions and the cost of living index, and with the consent of the central bank. These opinions should be worthy of reference for financial legislation; the restoration of the buying and selling and exchange of gold jewelry, as long as it does not involve speculative factors, is worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>In short, the nature of gold jewelry sales is different from the so-called gold bar sales. Gold jewelry sales are a form of people's savings; it does not have speculative factors in itself. If its value is in accordance with the regulations of the official price and it is not melted and sold in small bars; and the profits and wages of gold jewelry are controlled by the state, it should not conflict with the government's major policy of cracking down on gold speculation. At present, the majority of the people support the government's measures to crack down on gold speculation, but they are psychologically shaken by the danger that the gold jewelry earned from hard work may be frozen or become waste. Everyone is shaken, which is not good governance. Su Shi said: "If the people are unhappy and the customs are uneasy, there is no compensation for resentment even with the classic texts." Therefore, the financial legislative authorities should give administrative relief to the reasonable and non-speculative operations of the current silver jewelry industry nationwide!</p>

<h3>The U.S. Seeks Repayment of Lend-Lease Loans; The Soviet Union Has Agreed to Consider It; The U.S. Is Willing to Continue Supplying the Soviet Union with Materials Under the Principle of Cash Transactions</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 20th] Negotiations on the Soviet Union's debt of $1.1298 billion under the Lend-Lease Act have been delayed for a year, and today the Soviet Union has agreed to consider it. However, the State Department emphasized that the Soviet Union has not yet agreed to pay, and under the repeated urging of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, Molotov only agreed to "consider" it. The State Department is working hard to resolve the repayment of Lend-Lease loans with countries such as Britain, France, Belgium, Australia, Turkey, and New Zealand, all of which have been resolved before June. Negotiations are currently underway with China, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The United States had previously urged the Soviet Union to start negotiations on payment six times, but the Soviet Union ignored them. The U.S. Congress, in a fit of anger, stopped all shipments to the Soviet Union on January 1. However, the State Department announced today that the United States is still willing to ship food, leather, steel bars, tools, lubricants, and mining machinery worth 25 million yuan originally planned to be supplied to the Soviet Union after the war under the principle of cash transactions. When Lend-Lease, all non-cash transactions, ceased after the victory, the Soviet Union had separately ordered goods worth 25 million yuan from the United States.</p>
<p>As for the 1.1298 billion yuan under the wartime Lend-Lease Act, the Soviet Union is afraid that it will not pay it in full, because the original agreement stipulated that "losses and consumption during the war will be regarded as donations from the United States. However, the Soviet Union should pay for the remaining war materials that can be used for civilian purposes, such as trucks and tires."</p>
<p>[Reuters Prague Dispatch on the 20th] Czech News Agency Moscow reporter Saitga said: The Moscow side gradually believes that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy will change from an active offensive policy to a positive counter-offensive in the future. This counter-offensive will greatly disappoint those who thought they could intimidate the Soviet Union. The position of Soviet leaders and politicians has become more consolidated after this general election, and they can devote themselves to the struggle for true peace based on justice and humanity.</p>
<h3>Implementing Effective Control of Atomic Energy; The Veto Should Not Apply; The British Representative Insisted on This Point in the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake Dispatch on the 20th] British representative Cadogan recently declared at the Security Council that the United Kingdom still insists that the veto should not be used for countries that violate the regulations on the control of atomic weapons and conventional armaments. When the United Nations conducts discussions on universal disarmament, the United Kingdom will submit a proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters New York Dispatch on the 20th] During today's Security Council debate on the atomic energy issue, French representative Donnel suggested that the Atomic Energy Commission should submit its second report before June 30. At the same time, he also argued that the Security Council should pay attention to the points that have been agreed upon in the first report of the Atomic Energy Commission, and not pay too much attention to the points that have not been agreed upon. British representative Bedegan said that after studying the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union, he felt that a consensus agreement could be reached on the following three points: (1) It is technically possible to control atomic energy for peaceful purposes. (2) The control power should belong to a single international organization. (3) The control system should be established by multilateral conventions. Cadogan also said: We welcome the fact that Soviet representative Gromyko expressed acceptance of the point in the Baruch Plan that punishes violators of the control. However, we still hope that the veto will not be used to evade control. He also said that although there are still points that have not been agreed upon by the Security Council on the issue of atomic energy control, it is still possible to design implementation methods for the points that have already been agreed upon. The Security Council then decided to reschedule the discussion to 8:00 p.m. next Tuesday.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch on the 20th] The Republican-controlled House of Representatives today passed the budget amendment by a vote of 239 to 159. This amendment was proposed by the joint budget committee of the House and Senate, advocating reducing President Truman's proposed budget of 37.5 billion yuan for the next fiscal year by 6 billion yuan, including the expenses of the Army and Navy. Republican Chairman of the House Budget Committee Nussen said that after the budget is reduced, it can guarantee a 30% reduction in personal income tax. This case will now be submitted to the Senate for discussion, but Republican senators in that house only support reducing the budget by 4.5 billion yuan, so that the funds for the Army and Navy will not be reduced. The commanders of the Army and Navy have protested, saying that reducing military spending by 1.75 billion yuan will endanger national security.</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Attlee Announces British Policy Statement on India in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 20th] British Prime Minister Attlee made a statement on India policy in the House of Commons yesterday, stating: "Promoting Indian self-government has always been a consistent policy of successive British governments. In implementing this policy, the responsibility of the Indian people has gradually increased, and the internal affairs and military of India are dependent on both Indian officials and civilians. In terms of the constitution, the Acts passed by the British Parliament in 1919 and 1935 both represent Britain's transfer of major powers to India. In 1940, the British government further recognized a principle, that India should draft its own new constitution and build a fully self-governing India. In 1942, the British government urged India to establish a constituent body once the war ended.</p>
<p>"The British government feels that this policy is very appropriate and in line with sound democratic principles. Since taking office, the government has diligently implemented this policy, hoping to complete it as soon as possible. The Prime Minister's statement on March 15th of last year was widely praised, stating that the Indian people should decide their future national structure and constitution. In the view of the British government, the time has come for the Indian government to transfer responsibility to the Indian people.</p>
<p>"Last year, the Cabinet Mission went to India and consulted with Indian representatives for more than three months, with the aim of assisting them in resolving the method of self-drafting a constitution, so that the handover of responsibilities could be smoother and faster. The Cabinet representatives only made suggestions when the Indians and Muslims were unable to reach an agreement. These suggestions were published in May of last year, mainly proposing that India's future constitution should be determined by a National Assembly, and the National Assembly should be composed of representatives from British India and Indian princely states representing all sectors of society and various interests.</p>
<p>"After the Cabinet Mission returned home, India has produced a provisional central government, with the participation of major political leaders who exercise great power under the existing constitution, and all provincial governments of India that are responsible for legislation are also included.</p>
<p>"Currently, opinions among various parties in India are still conflicting, so that the National Assembly cannot function. The British government regrets this very much. According to the original plan, the National Assembly must represent all parties. The British government is willing to transfer responsibility to the responsible authorities stipulated by the constitution that conforms to the plan of the Cabinet Mission and is approved by various parties in India. Unfortunately, there is currently no hope for the emergence of such a constitution and responsible authority. This phenomenon is full of crises and should not be allowed to continue indefinitely. The British government now intends to take necessary actions to transfer power to the Indian authorities no later than June 1948.</p>
<p>"The current population of India has exceeded 400 million. In the past century, as a member of the British Commonwealth and Empire, it has enjoyed peace and security. If the Indian people want to fully develop their economy and achieve a higher standard of living, the need for peace and security is even greater today. The British government is eager to transfer responsibility to a government supported by all the people, and this government must be able to maintain peace and govern with fair and effective means. Therefore, the various parties in India should abandon their prejudices and prepare to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country next year.</p>
<p>"The Cabinet Mission has planned meticulously for several months and has largely agreed on the method of completing the constitution, and has published it in a communiqué in May of last year. Therefore, the British government has agreed to submit to Parliament the constitution made by the Constituent Assembly that meets the suggested conditions and contains representatives of all parties. However, if the constitution cannot be completed by the Constituent Assembly within the time proposed in Section 7, the British government will consider who to transfer the power of the central government of British India to within a limited time, whether British India should be transferred entirely to a certain form of central government, whether some areas should be transferred to the current provincial government, or whether it should be transferred in other more reasonable circumstances that are most beneficial to the Indian people.</p>
<p>"Although the final transfer of power must wait until June 1948, various preparations must be made in advance. The important point is that the efficiency of the Indian civil administration must be maintained, and its national defense must also be fully prepared. However, during the transfer process, it will undoubtedly be difficult to implement the provisions of the 1935 Government of India Act one by one. At that time, new laws will have to be enacted to ensure that the transfer of power can proceed smoothly."</p>
<p>"As for the Indian princely states, as the Cabinet Mission has made clear, the British government has no intention of transferring the rights and obligations belonging to the princes to any government of British India. The British government has no intention of ending the monarchical system of the Indian states before the final deadline for the transfer of power, and will consider entering into separate agreements with each state during the transition period."</p>
<p>"The British government believes that British commercial and industrial interests in India have good opportunities to operate in this new environment. There has been a long and friendly commercial relationship between Britain and India in the past. Continuing this relationship in the future will be beneficial to both parties. Before concluding this statement, the British government must, on behalf of the British people, sincerely express its best wishes to the Indian people who are moving towards the final stage of self-government. The British people all earnestly hope that although the relationship between Britain and India may undergo fundamental changes, the relationship between the people of the two countries will never be severed because of this. The British people hope to continue to do their best to promote the further welfare of India."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Attlee then issued the following additional statement:</p>
<p>"Members of this House are often informed of the events announced today. Field Marshal Wavell, since the beginning of the war, has served as senior commander in South Asia, the Middle East, and India. In 1943, he became the wartime Governor-General of India, and has been in office for almost four years. During his term, he devoted himself to public service and achieved remarkable results. Now that British-Indian relations have entered a new stage, the government believes that this is the best time to approve Field Marshal Wavell's departure. His Majesty has appointed Admiral Lord Mountbatten as his successor. He will hand over the British-administered Indian government to the local people so that they can achieve happiness and prosperity. After taking office, Lord Mountbatten will continue to serve as an active member of the Royal Navy according to his wishes. I firmly believe that members of Parliament will recognize that Lord Mountbatten will certainly be able to perform the new task happily, and at the same time, members will be pleased that His Majesty has approved Lord Wavell's promotion to the peerage," he said.</p>
<p>Lawrence Statement</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] After Lord Lawrence, the British Secretary of State for India and Burma Affairs, made a statement on India in the House of Lords, the members of Parliament were shocked. Lord Lawrence's statement on British policy towards India was the same as that made by Prime Minister Attlee in the House of Commons.

<h3>Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Postal Workers Union Resolve to Demand Salaries Still Be Paid According to Index - Wu Kai-hsien Expresses Unfairness Regarding Rationing</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon, chaired by the chairman of the federation, Shui Hsiang-yün. In addition to reporting on the visit to Nanjing last week, they discussed in detail the issues raised by the members regarding the impact of the freeze on the cost-of-living index on the future lives of workers. It was decided to appoint Shui Hsiang-yün, Chou Hsueh-hsiang, and Ch'ou Chang-chiang and 18 others to form a petition delegation. They will take the night train to Nanjing tomorrow to petition the National Defense Supreme Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other relevant agencies, requesting the maintenance of the cost-of-living index and proposing remedial measures to improve the lives of workers. The delegation also decided to petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Bureau of Social Affairs in the next two days.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, believing that the economic emergency measures announced by the central government and the declared freeze on the cost-of-living index, while commodity prices cannot be suppressed, will inevitably affect the efficiency of postal workers, held an emergency meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday at the union's clubhouse on Wuchang Road. The chairman of the union, Wang Chen-pai, Shui Hsiang-yün, an executive director of the National Postal Workers' Union, and more than ten representatives from postal workers' unions in Hankou, Hunan, Nanjing, and other places attended to discuss the issue of remuneration. It was decided to join with more than 50 representatives from postal workers' unions along the two railways to take the night train to Nanjing tomorrow to petition the Ministry of Communications and relevant parties, requesting that employees' salaries be paid according to the cost-of-living index. The union also intends to propose a new plan, and if it fails to obtain government approval, it will invite postal workers from all over the country to go to Nanjing for a major petition.</p>
<h3>How Will This Month's Wages Be Paid? - Decision to Be Discussed and Determined Within Days</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since the government announced the economic emergency measures plan, decided to supply daily necessities to public servants and industrial workers, and stipulated that the wages for February should not exceed the January cost-of-living index, how the wages of workers this month should be paid is of great concern to all sectors. Yesterday, the reporter visited Wu Kai-hsien, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, to inquire about this issue. According to him, it is currently being discussed with relevant parties and will be decided within days.</p>
<p>Wu stated that the government's supply of daily necessities to factory workers will be implemented from March because purchases could not be completed this month. In addition to paying wages according to the January index, it will be stipulated that the difference between the average price in February and the average price in January for the supplied five pecks of rice per person per month, one hundred catties of coal briquettes, and two lengths of cloth every six months will be converted into legal tender and paid. The average price for February will be announced by the authorities. However, the General Federation of Trade Unions has expressed dissatisfaction with the government's method of supplying daily necessities, believing that the quantity and types of supplies should not be different from those for public servants and teachers. One hundred catties of coal briquettes cannot cook five pecks of rice, and the food intake of laborers should not be less than that of mental workers. Moreover, the January cost-of-living index was calculated based on 1.9 pecks of rice per person. He believes that this request is reasonable. Also, it is unfair that workers have rations, while employees of other companies and businesses do not, and the wages of workers cannot exceed the January index. Therefore, he believes that all those whose wages are calculated based on the cost-of-living index should be handled in the same way. This morning (yesterday), he argued with relevant leaders for a long time at the Bank of China on the second floor, but there was no result. It has now been submitted to the mayor for instructions and will definitely be resolved within days. Wu also stated that if this issue cannot be resolved and the Bureau of Social Affairs has difficulty operating, he will resign.</p>
<p>Wu also stated that when workers are given rations in the future, each factory will only register the required quantity with the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Bureau of Social Affairs will forward it to relevant agencies for allocation and sale. The rationing of public servants and teachers will be handled by another agency of the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Gold Black Market Transactions; Reward People for Reporting; 20% of Confiscated Gold as Bonus; Two Procurators Visit Supervisory Group to Discuss Coordination and Implementation Issues</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Economic Supervisory Group's investigation of the gold rush is gaining momentum. Yesterday morning, the High Procuratorate and the District Procuratorate sent Procurators Lin Wopeng and Zhu Xiyu to the Supervisory Group for discussions. They discussed in detail the coordination issues that may arise during future enforcement. It is understood that both parties have decided that if the investigation results only in administrative liability, the punishment should be handled by the administrative authorities without being transferred to the court. If there is a definite violation of the Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Regulations during Extraordinary Times, it will be sent to the court for strict handling. At 2:00 PM, an important meeting was held on the third floor of the Garrison Headquarters. Commander Xuan Tiewu, Chief Secretary of the Economic Supervisory Group Li Zheng, Gold and Currency Group Leader Xu Youzuo, Supervisory Committee Members Zhang Qingzhen, Gu Fengxiang, He Hanwen, Wan Can, Director Dai of the Ministry of Finance, Director Gao of the Four Joint Offices, and two auditors sent by the Audit Department attended. During the meeting, the participants reviewed the financial panic and discussed how to concentrate efforts and divide labor. It was decided that Supervisory Committee members would focus on investigating government officials using public funds for speculation, while Ministry of Finance personnel would be responsible for investigating banks and money houses. To prevent and eliminate future gold black market transactions, it is proposed to reward people for reporting. Twenty percent of the gold seized as a result will be used as a bonus. However, this method is still pending approval by the highest authorities. As for the "blacklist" that all sectors are eagerly awaiting, it is believed that the Economic Supervisory Group will complete it soon, but because it is of great importance, it is feared that it will be difficult to release it before it is submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval. Therefore, "action" will also have to wait. However, according to Chief Secretary Li Zheng of the group, who spoke to reporters yesterday, "No matter what, the truth will come out by the end of February!"</p>

<h3>Collection of This Year's Land Tax Commences; Three Flexible Measures Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the collection of this year's land tax, the Municipal Government, in order to adapt to the actual needs, specifically approved the following three flexible measures yesterday: (1) This year's land tax will be implemented under a new system. All tax registers are recently compiled and may inevitably have discrepancies with the original registers. To prevent the registration of property certificates by fraudulent means, a stamp of "Not for Property Certificate" will be affixed to the land tax receipt, so that property disputes can be resolved separately according to law. (2) Recently, prices have soared and the cost of tax registers has become increasingly expensive. In order to show consideration for poor farmers and save manpower and resources, each grain household will be subject to a minimum amount of 500 yuan. Those below 500 yuan will be exempt from tax, and a system of combining households will be adopted. Although there are many scattered households in the original grain register, the number that falls below 500 yuan after being combined should not be large, so the relationship with the treasury revenue is still small. (3) Recently, small denominations of currency below 100 yuan have become rare. In the future, the tax will be collected in units of 100 yuan, and amounts below 100 yuan will be rounded off for collection.</p>
<h3>Teng Yongxi Tried for Suspected Concealment of Automobile Materials</h3>
<p>Claims to Have No Prior Acquaintance with Wang Zhuchen; Deposit Was Introduced by Wang's Brother-in-Law</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Teng Yongxi, the former Deputy Director of the Putuo Branch Bureau, who is suspected of hiding stolen goods for Wang Zhuchen in the case of Wang Zhuchen's concealment of materials from the enemy Changdao Foreign Firm, was investigated by the District Procuratorate and prosecuted. The Criminal Division 8 of the District Court held its first public hearing at 2:00 PM yesterday. According to Teng, he served as the Deputy Director of the Jiangning Branch Bureau and the Putuo Branch Bureau in this city, and has now resigned. He has no prior acquaintance with Wang Zhuchen, but is a classmate of Wang's brother-in-law, Yu Qingjian. At the time, Yu came and said that he had purchased a batch of automobile materials in Hongkou and asked him to find a way to store them. Because he did not know that they were enemy property concealed by Wang, he introduced them to be stored at the Central Machinery Factory. According to the witness Fan Rongchun (Manager of the Central Machinery Factory), because Teng was the Deputy Director of the police bureau in charge, he did not suspect anything wrong with the search for storage. The automobile parts were sent by Teng accompanied by Yu Qingjian on August 8th last year. On August 13th, Gu Dingyi, a staff member of the factory, read the Shen Bao that day and saw a report about Wang Zhuchen hiding enemy property. The materials that the informant reported to the investigation team that Wang Zhuchen had moved out of 2 Beihai Ning Road were roughly the same as the materials that Teng and Yu had sent in. Therefore, he reported it to the police bureau for investigation, etc. Judge Wang Jiazhuo believes that the case is not yet clear and needs further investigation, and ordered a rescheduled hearing. The defendant Teng Yongxi was released on his original bail.</p>

The reasons for this are not clear to the outside world, and the adjustment of prices is unavoidable.

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Intention to Commit Bigamy</p>
<p>Ling Shiwu asks: My nephew married a woman from his hometown in 1926 and they have two children each. Their life is stable. After the victory, my nephew was transferred to another place, and his family remained in their original location. Recently, someone from that place said that my nephew is planning to marry a woman from another place, which has raised questions. I respectfully request your response: (1) If he marries a woman from another place, can my nephew's wife sue him for abandonment or bigamy? (2) If they do not marry but cohabit, can my nephew's wife sue him for abandonment or adultery? (3) Can a lawsuit for abandonment only be filed when my nephew stops providing living expenses for the family? (4) If he secretly marries the woman outside and the matter is discovered six months or a year later, does she still have the right to sue under the law?</p>
<p>[Attorney Mi Xitong answers] (1) Abandonment should be judged based on whether he bears living expenses or not. She can sue for bigamy. (2) Abandonment is as answered above. She can sue for adultery. (3) Yes. (4) She cannot sue after six months from the date of knowledge.</p>
<p>(2) Demolish House and Return Land</p>
<p>Lu Cheng asks: In 1937, I rented a piece of vacant land, about three fen, from the Jia family and built three flat houses. A lease was signed for ten years, with rent paid annually, and the house would be demolished and the land returned upon expiration. However, the Jia family has sold the land to the Yi family, and the Yi family lives in another place, so no new land lease contract has been signed and rent cannot be paid. Please advise: (1) Can I ask the Yi family to renew the lease after the lease expires? If the request is denied, how should I resolve it? (2) Because I have surplus houses to rent to tenants, there are no deposit fees. If the land expires and the house is to be demolished, and the tenants are notified in advance to move out, how should it be resolved if they refuse to move out? Is there any legal regulation for tenants to request relocation fees, and can I refuse to pay? (3) Can I interfere with the subletting of the second-hand tenants who privately collect transfer fees, and take back the house for my own use?</p>
<p>[Attorney Mi Xitong answers] (1) Yes, otherwise apply to the court for renewal of the lease. (2) You can sue to the court for eviction. There are no legal regulations for relocation fees, but they can be paid out of good grace. (3) It is possible if there is a special agreement in the lease.</p>

A complete set of animal and plant specimens, glassware, and two microscopes were destroyed. The student Wei, who failed the make-up exam and whose request for another make-up exam was unsuccessful, harbored resentment and is highly suspected of arson.

<p>According to a Hangzhou report: Jiang Dongfang, the eldest son of Jiang Yun, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fifth District of Zhejiang Province, is sixteen years old and was studying in the third grade of junior high school in Hangzhou. He was expelled by the school for being absent from class for more than fifteen hours last semester. After learning of this, his mother went to negotiate with Jiang Wenwei, the former principal of the school, who in turn negotiated with the newly appointed Principal Qi to make an exception and allow him to return to school. On the 11th of this month, Jiang brought money to the school to register on his mother's orders, but was still not allowed. Fearing that he would be scolded by his parents, the student left without saying goodbye. On the afternoon of the 15th, while the family was in a state of panic, they received a plain letter from Shanghai without a return address, stating that he was going north that day and would return to Hangzhou after June. His mother was very concerned about her son and negotiated with the school for days. It is heard that the school is sending personnel to the Suzhou area to search for him.</p>

<p>今晚籃球有激戰</p>
<p>There Will Be a Fierce Basketball Game Tonight</p>
<p>華聯火併恩卡斯</p>
<p>Hualian to Clash with Enkas</p>
<p>甲二部重要比賽晨友對綠林</p>
<p>Important Second Division Game: Chengyou vs. Lulin</p>
<p>平凡已久之二屆籃球聯賽，今晚將有激刺鏡頭出現，甲一組由上屆冠軍華聯出戰恩卡斯，五時半起在巿體育館舉行。其他二塲首塲培爾對印第安，次幕晨友對綠林，門票仍售二千元及三千元。</p>
<p>The second basketball league, which has been uneventful for a long time, will have exciting moments tonight. In the first division, Hualian, the champion of the previous season, will play against Enkas, starting at 5:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. The other two games are the first game, Pearl vs. Indian, and the second game, Chengyou vs. Lulin. Tickets are still sold for 2,000 and 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>首塲甲二部培爾對印第安，前者曾於上週冷門突出，擊敗綠林，士氣旺盛，日前對抗甲申之役，雖遭敗北，但戰鬥力已充份發揮，俞氏昆仲王為公等聯絡頗見默契。後者為西青乙組勁旅，巨人隊凱捷密洛夫一手訓練，惟出師以來，每戰俱北，且曾棄權一次，該部殿軍一席，大有非彼莫屬之槪，但該隊長力充沛，培爾應知審愼。</p>
<p>The first game is Pearl vs. Indian in the second division. The former had a surprising upset last week, defeating Lulin, and their morale is high. In the battle against Jiashen the other day, although they were defeated, their fighting power was fully demonstrated. The Yu brothers and Wang Weigong and others have shown good coordination. The latter is a strong team in the second group of Xiqing, trained by Kiejie Miluofu of the Giants. However, since their debut, they have lost every game and even forfeited once. The last place in the division seems to belong to them, but the team has plenty of stamina, and Pearl should be cautious.</p>
<p>次幕同組晨友遭遇綠林，晨友對本屆甲二部首席，頗有染指之企圖，出師以來戰無不勝，聲勢喧赫，麾下健將史久全等，皆為球壇知名之士，綠林小將，經錢旭滄之熏陶後，球藝猛晋，王介平，葉云山，陳正淼，樂嘉洲等，投籃準確，防宗嚴密，上週不幸遭培爾毒後，發奮圖勵，今日兩雄相遇，倘綠林能勝，則與晨友積分相等，晨友告捷，則該冠軍，已在掌握中，為冠軍前途計，必各出全力，以決雌雄。</p>
<p>In the second game, Chengyou of the same group will face Lulin. Chengyou has the ambition to win the top spot in the second division this year. They have been undefeated since their debut and have a loud reputation. Their strong players, such as Shi Jiuquan, are all well-known in the basketball world. After being trained by Qian Xuchang, the young players of Lulin have made rapid progress in their skills. Wang Jieping, Ye Yunshan, Chen Zhengmiao, Le Jiazhou, and others have accurate shooting and tight defense. After unfortunately being poisoned by Pearl last week, they are determined to work hard. Today, when the two strong teams meet, if Lulin can win, they will have the same points as Chengyou. If Chengyou wins, the championship will be in their grasp. For the sake of the championship, they must both go all out to determine the winner.</p>
<p>壓軸戰甲一部華聯相逢恩卡斯，華聯係籃壇盟主，若吳成章孔廣益任相成唐實堃卓國榮包松圓陳學崇李震中等，婦孺皆知者，惟上月中曾遭春茂毒手，殊為遺憾，此番前車可鑒，必力爭上游，故勝利似無問題，勢必難免。今日秩序錄下：</p>
<p>The final game is Hualian vs. Enkas in the first division. Hualian is the leader in the basketball world. Wu Chengzhang, Kong Guangyi, Ren Xiangcheng, Tang Shikun, Zhuo Guorong, Bao Songyuan, Chen Xuechong, Li Zhenzhong, and others are all well-known. However, they were poisoned by Chunmao in the middle of last month, which is a pity. This time, they must learn from the past and strive to move forward, so victory seems to be no problem and inevitable. Today's schedule is recorded below:</p>
<p>培爾—印第安（甲二）五時卅分　裁判俞菊廬吳效堤</p>
<p>Pearl - Indian (Second Division) 5:30 PM Referees: Yu Julu, Wu Xiaodi</p>
<p>晨友—綠林（甲二）六時卅分　裁判凱捷密洛夫陶勃林基</p>

<p>論今晚籃球戰</p>
<p>On Tonight's Basketball Games</p>
<p>各組進入精彩階段</p>
<p>Each Group Enters an Exciting Stage</p>
<p>籃球聯賽，目前已進入精彩階段，女子組綠隊五戰五勝，雪白三戰不敗，明日二隊相逢作冠軍決賽，自以綠隊冠軍較有把握。甲二部晨友保持四戰四勝紀錄，而綠林雖日前不幸，敗於冷門小將培爾，然實力仍在。陳正淼之入竄，葉雲山之托送，舒家義之中央突破，均為令人頭痛之殺手鐧，，晨友後防將極感棘手。然唯一致勝之訣，在於以牙還牙，利用王炳福何增之主竄，王蓉生史久全之中距攻勢，及黃存瑞之遠射。但存瑞如果犯了「射球寒熱病」，應速以他人易之，並可採穩紥穩打之戰術，綠林小將將無亂中偷襲之機。如果這一塲勝了，即冠軍天下可定，得不到晨友盃無關緊要，聯賽盟主，才是眞的光榮。</p>
<p>The basketball league is currently entering an exciting stage. In the women's division, the Green Team has five wins in five games, and the Snow White Team is undefeated in three games. The two teams will meet tomorrow for the championship final, and the Green Team is more likely to win the championship. In the second division, Chengyou maintains a record of four wins in four games, and although Lulin unfortunately lost to the underdog Pearl the other day, their strength remains. Chen Zhengmiao's incursions, Ye Yunshan's passes, and Shu Jiayi's central breakthroughs are all troublesome trump cards, and Chengyou's defense will find it very difficult to deal with. However, the only key to victory is to fight fire with fire, using Wang Bingfu and He Zeng's main incursions, Wang Rongsheng and Shi Jiuquan's mid-range attacks, and Huang Cunrui's long-range shots. But if Cunrui suffers from "shooting fever," he should be quickly replaced by someone else, and a steady and solid tactic can be adopted so that the young players of Lulin will have no chance to sneak attack in the chaos. If they win this game, the championship will be decided. It doesn't matter if they don't get the Chengyou Cup. The league championship is the real glory.</p>
<p>甲一部巨人與油隊是不敗的常勝軍，然上屆盟主華聯，及仁餘，海陸青，恩卡斯均有問　之資格，今後各塲，將極精彩，日來體育館內之清冷氣氛，將一掃而空。</p>
<p>The Giants and the Oil Team in the first division are undefeated victors, but Hualian, the champion of the previous season, and Renyu, Hailuqing, and Enkas are all qualified to compete for the championship. In the future, each game will be very exciting, and the cold atmosphere in the gymnasium in recent days will be swept away.</p>
<p>今晚首塲甲二部培爾逢印第安，無關緊要的，但印第安如吃了敗仗，則　軍一席，非伊莫屬。次幕甲二組晟友戰綠林，前面已提到，無疑問的，這是一幕精彩之戰，如果不出冷門，晨友可穩獲甲二部冠軍。</p>
<p>Tonight's first game in the second division, Pearl vs. Indian, is not important, but if Indian loses, the last place in the division will belong to them. The second game, Chengyou vs. Lulin in the second division, has been mentioned earlier. There is no doubt that this is an exciting game. If there is no upset, Chengyou can steadily win the second division championship.</p>
<p>壓軸戰華聯戰恩卡斯，這是華聯輪戰五强之始，華聯首仗即出冷門為黑馬春茂勝去，然華聯的威風仍在，今晚預料大李一定出戰，眞是千呼萬喚始出來。想阿弟老包及學崇，在李震中的組織下，定會予番將一個「莫奈我何」，球迷要看好球，今朝開始了，今晚各隊名單抄錄如下：</p>
<p>The final game is Hualian vs. Enkas. This is the beginning of Hualian's round-robin battle with the five strongest teams. Hualian's first game was an upset, with the dark horse Chunmao winning. However, Hualian's prestige remains. It is expected that Da Li will definitely play tonight, which is truly a case of being called upon a thousand times before finally appearing. It is thought that Ah Di, Lao Bao, and Xuechong, under the organization of Li Zhenzhong, will definitely give the foreign generals a "what can you do to me" attitude. Fans who want to see a good game, it starts today. The rosters of each team tonight are recorded below:</p>

<p>(De Wen) On Enkas</p>
<p>華聯應勝</p>
<p>Hualian Should Win</p>
<p>今夕籃球聯賽，甲一組華聯遇恩卡斯，以言智略，穩健，華聯皆高出一籌，恩卡斯自主將却利勃脫離去，攻守均形色减色，今晚華聯應以包松圓，任相成，吳成章，張良雄，陳學崇上塲，局勢已可穩定，大李（震中）無出塲必要也。</p>
<p>In tonight's basketball league, Hualian of the first division meets Enkas. In terms of strategy and stability, Hualian is superior. Since Enkas's main player, Que Libo, left, both their offense and defense have been weakened.

<p>[Reuters, Chicago, 19th] Bloom, President of the United States Olympic Association, said today: It is reported that the British Amateur Athletic Association may consider allowing athletes participating in the 1948 London World Games to receive cash to compensate for their loss of work. This association and the United States Amateur Athletic Association cannot tolerate this. Amateur athletes who can receive compensation for lost work time are no different from professional athletes. Bloom also said that it is doubtful whether the Soviet Union will participate in the 1948 World Games. The condition for participating in the World Games is that they must be members of the International Amateur Athletic Association or its affiliated organizations. The Soviet Union has not joined these organizations and should not be allowed to participate according to the law.</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕羽毛球公開個人錦標賽，昨晚第二夕，六時起賽，初高級單打各一塲，高級雙打一塲，俱成一面倒形勢。初級單打司巴二對〇勝老將趙鐵保，高級單打李國璠二對〇輕取鄭墨，高級雙打徐國華李國璠二對〇勝王中成與伊凡諾夫，巿體育館空氣尚不寂寞。茲將比賽情况述後：</p>
<p>[Our Report] In the second evening of the Open Badminton Individual Championship last night, starting at 6 PM, one preliminary and one advanced singles match, and one advanced doubles match, all became one-sided. In the preliminary singles, Si Ba defeated veteran Zhao Tiebao 2-0. In the advanced singles, Li Guofan easily defeated Zheng Mo 2-0. In the advanced doubles, Xu Guohua and Li Guofan defeated Wang Zhongcheng and Ivanoff 2-0. The atmosphere at the City Gymnasium was not lonely. The details of the competition are described below:</p>
<p>初級單打</p>
<p>Preliminary Singles</p>
<p>首塲為初級單打，司巴最初頗佔優勢，五比二領前，老將趙鐵保善施高壓球，戰成各七各八平物，司巴幾下失誤，大呼「上帝」，反成十比十一為趙超出一分，瞬復見十二平手，難解難分，趙先進十三，因體肥吃力，願以二分定勝負，被「高鼻子」得利。</p>
<p>The first game was the preliminary singles. Si Ba initially had a significant advantage, leading 5-2. Veteran Zhao Tiebao was good at high-pressure shots, and the score was tied at 7 and 8. Si Ba made a few mistakes and shouted "God," which turned into 10-11, with Zhao leading by one point. Then the score was tied again at 12. It was difficult to tell who would win. Zhao advanced to 13 first, but because he was overweight, he was struggling. He was willing to decide the outcome with two points, which benefited the "tall nose."</p>
<p>第二區司巴仍因善奔便宜，對方心有餘而力不足，雖擬嚴密防守，卒為司巴以位置球屢次進製，戰成十五比七，老將軍一笑了之，勝負非所計也</p>
<p>In the second set, Si Ba still benefited from his good running. His opponent's heart was willing but his strength was not enough. Although he intended to defend strictly, Si Ba repeatedly scored with positional shots, making the score 15-7. The veteran general laughed it off, as the victory or defeat was not what he was concerned about.</p>
<p>高級單打</p>
<p>Advanced Singles</p>
<p>鄭墨先獲二分後，李國璠即不再容情，連得九分，未幾，即以十五比二結束首局，情緒未見緊張。</p>
<p>After Zheng Mo scored two points first, Li Guofan showed no mercy and scored nine consecutive points. Before long, he ended the first game with 15-2, and he did not seem nervous.</p>
<p>再戰第二局，李仍「輕描淡寫」，十五分頃刻立就，鄭則無所獲。</p>
<p>In the second game, Li still "painted lightly," and the fifteen points were quickly achieved, while Zheng gained nothing.</p>
<p>高級雙打</p>
<p>Advanced Doubles</p>
<p>因兩單打之冷靜，觀眾頗期望雙打賽之將有熱烈塲面，徐李一為港地名手，一係滬上健將，二人且　老搭擋，王中成與依凡諾夫中西合璧，並肩作戰，依凡諾夫為蘇聯足球隊右鋒，生性好動，初戰時雙方短兵相接，比數互相上落，李徐連得十一分，以十五比六勝第一局。</p>
<p>Because of the calmness of the two singles matches, the audience was quite hoping that the doubles match would have a lively scene. Xu and Li are both famous players from Hong Kong and Shanghai, and they are also old partners. Wang Zhongcheng and Ivanoff combined Chinese and Western styles and fought side by side. Ivanoff is a right forward on the Soviet football team and is naturally active. In the initial battle, the two sides</p>

<p>Essays and Anecdotes	Tears of Separation by Zhang Qiqu</p>
<p>Hui's plan to go to the United States began a year ago in Chongqing. It only gradually became concrete three months ago. With the Ministry of Education's approval, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' approval, the embassy's approval, obtaining a passport, applying for foreign exchange... step by step approaching, until the shipping company sent the notice of the departure date, we were not very interested in the farewell. Because in these three months, with each step forward, we held a farewell feast, sandwiched between Christmas, New Year, and the Lantern Festival, conveniently bidding farewell, and we don't know how many times we have treated her to wine and how many times we have danced. Now that she is really going on board, it's just eating and dancing! It's so boring.</p>
<p>Farewell words and blessings have also become commonplace. So, on the eve of boarding, everyone just quietly had a home-cooked meal and went to bed early to avoid being flustered the next day.</p>
<p>Traveling should be like this. Take things lightly. The eight years of the War of Resistance are just a fleeting moment; although going to the United States is ten thousand miles away, with today's scientific advancements, it is not as difficult as traveling from Nanjing to Beijing a hundred years ago. Those who are reluctant to part and act like children are just unable to control their emotions and are simply creating trouble for themselves.</p>
<p>Hui said: "Separation has a strange feeling, and tears will naturally flow. So it's best if everyone doesn't see me off, just vaguely, like going to Nanjing or Hangzhou, and let the ship sail away. "But I don't believe it. I want to see her off. I am confident that I can control myself. Qing and Yu, regardless of any reason, insisted on seeing her off at the pier. So the three of us helped her carry her suitcases and sent her to the Huangpu Wharf. There were already many passengers on the dock. A large 15,000-ton ocean liner was tightly docked against the riverbank like a screen, with a bridge ladder in the center for luggage and passengers to board. Those seeing off were not allowed on board and stood below waving to relatives and friends on the deck. Occasionally, there were one or two faces with sorrow, but most were happy.</p>
<p>Of course, those Americans were returning home and should be happy; Chinese people, whether going to study, investigate, meet lovers, or make a fortune overseas, should be even happier. Those with sorrowful faces are still creating trouble for themselves.</p>
<p>Qing said: "Maybe there isn't a single couple among the send-offs today. Otherwise, they definitely wouldn't not cry."</p>
<p>I don't believe it.</p>
<p>After the luggage was loaded onto the ship, Hui came down again to tell us about the general situation in the cabin and then went with us to eat shepherd's purse wontons near the pier. That was authentic Chinese dim sum, and after crossing the ocean, she would have no chance to enjoy such refreshing flavors again! Although the price was cheap, the taste was authentic. We casually talked, ate, and laughed, like having dim sum in a small restaurant. Although Hui admitted that her emotions were relatively fragile, she was calm and composed amidst everyone's nonchalant laughter. Qing had always been confident and strong, so naturally, there was no trace of sorrow either.</p>
<p>After eating, we smoked and chatted in the dim sum shop, waiting for time to pass. Time is a strange thing. If it were a traitor going to the execution ground, he would cherish these two hours very much. He could write a will, compose a farewell poem, write a letter to the chairman, complain, and scold people as much as possible; however, we just spent it in lighthearted conversation.</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, we sent her back to the ship. At this time, there were even more people seeing her off. In the crowd, Yu first noticed a chubby foreign woman with tears all over her face. The remnants of lipstick from her relatives and children were on her cheeks, which was very ridiculous. Because the ship was about to depart, those who had boarded no longer came down, but just waved to the people below. Hui also stood on the deck, smiling and throwing candies at us.</p>
<p>Soon, Yu discovered a Chinese girl in a leather coat, standing far away alone, wiping her tears.</p>
<p>At this time, the river wind was very strong, the air pressure was quite low, and it looked like it was going to rain. Some foreign children were jumping and shouting below, greeting their mothers on the ship. Two foreigners were playing the accordion, and one was singing to relatives and friends below. One foreign man had just walked onto the bridge and quickly retreated to the base of the bridge, and another foreign man jumped up and hugged his neck for a kiss.</p>
<p>Foreigners express emotions more strongly than Chinese people, which is admirable.</p>
<p>Another old lady was wiping her eyes; after all, she was a woman. Men, at most, were like those three Chinese youths who looked like students, silently leaning on the railing and looking at each other.</p>
<p>Hui's smile had disappeared at some point. Qing was just walking alone in the distance, trying hard to restrain herself.</p>
<p>Three firecrackers were set off at the bow of the ship, which seemed to be a signal that it was about to set sail. There was a commotion on the shore, and people on the ship and ashore waved their hands together, mostly foreigners. As for the Chinese, Hui's hand was dragging and unable to wave! Qing was facing the river, taking off her glasses and putting them on again, not knowing what she was busy with. My heart began to feel a little heavy. But I was still objectively observing other people's expressions to regulate my own emotions.</p>
<p>The ship still hadn't left, but it was really starting to rain. Fortunately, it wasn't heavy, just a drizzle, hitting our faces, which was perfect for covering up people's tear stains. Several big men were also wiping their faces with handkerchiefs, not knowing whether they were wiping away rain or tears. But an old foreign man, because his hands were busy waving to the people on the ship, had no time to wipe his face, and I saw tears the size of soybeans rolling down.</p>
<p>After a while, the bridge was hoisted up by the sailors. More than a dozen workers on the shore held it up and worked together to remove it. With a loud noise, it was laid flat on the ground. This indicated that the ship was about to depart. There was another uproar on the shore, with people waving their hands up and down. Behind me, six or seven foreign men, eight or nine women, and more than a dozen children began to sing a farewell song. The singing was quite loud, but the sound was a bit shaky, and because of the slowness, it sounded a bit like a funeral song, making it even more sad. Those people were singing, waving, wiping tears, and blowing kisses with their hands.</p>
<p>The singing was hateful, and every sound seemed to drag me into the sorrow of parting. I could only stand firmly by the ship, waiting for the end of that funeral song.</p>
<p>The rain was getting heavier, and Qing and Yu were also standing stiffly in the front row, looking up at Hui. Although they were less than eight feet away from the railing, one was on the ship and the other was on the shore, as if separated by a natural barrier. Hui kept crying, first burying her face in her hands, as if afraid of being laughed at. Later, she simply revealed her crying face and stared blankly at the shore, seeming to be looking at us, yet seeming to see nothing, just lost in thought.</p>
<p>A Chinese girl standing next to Hui, whose relatives had already left, was still standing sadly on the deck, looking at the motherland she was about to leave with tearful eyes; on Hui's left, the three Chinese students with worried faces also waved their hands down, not knowing whether it was because the wind was strong and they were afraid of catching a cold, or whether they were afraid that the rain would wet their faces, only seeing them wave their hands once and wipe their noses twice. Looking closely at the direction of their gaze, it was clear that there were also three female guests below wiping their noses with them.</p>
<p>There were obviously more people crying. Old and young, men and women, foreigners and locals alike. Some people were also laughing, but that kind of laughter might have a deeper meaning than crying. Only me, I could control myself. I was fighting with the atmosphere of sorrow and parting, resisting the farewell song that sounded like a funeral march, and meeting Hui's tearful eyes. I wanted to stand firm in this torrent of tears and give the crying a reprimand!</p>
<p>Why cry? Since people have arranged their own destiny, they should bravely accept this fact. Crying is cowardly, it is contradictory!</p>
<p>With a crash, the ship was unmoored! At the same time, a spring-like tremor occurred on the shore and on the ship, and the highest level of the deck, two foreigners were braving the rain and playing the accordion again, and the foreigners on the second deck and their relatives and friends on the shore sang a majestic farewell song. The previous group singing the farewell song sang even more vigorously at this time, and the voices trembled even more, like praying in a church. An old priest on the ship also waved his hand sluggishly below.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ship's whistle roared, and the sound was like a heavy bomb falling into the heart of the river, and like the echo of an empty valley, rumbling and hitting my heart fiercely. I couldn't hold on anymore. The ship, which was originally close to the dock, had now cracked a gap, that gap, like symbolizing the imperfection of life, and this imperfection was gradually expanding and expanding. People on the ship leaned half their bodies over the railing, ignoring the surging river water below, just waving their hands desperately to the shore. The farewell guests on the shore, like chasing a lost dream, walked forward step by step. Forgetting the rain above, the mud below, the coats that had already been soaked, the hands that had been stained with tears and snot, just waving! Shouting! Cherishing this last second!</p>
<p>Another whistle! My heart shook again.</p>
<p>This sound was like a long sigh of a hero, indicating a firm departure from this land! Originally, the passengers and the send-offs were very close, just like one person leaning on a window upstairs and one person standing downstairs. Now, it was like a piece of land suddenly divided into two, one piece was abandoned here, while the other went to another world across the vast ocean.</p>
<p>For three months, although we had been talking about farewells every day, and saying goodbye every day, we were still living together after all. No matter how we imagined it, we could not truly experience the taste of separation. Only this whistle, a song, and the fact that the ship's hull was gradually leaving the riverbank, made people deeply feel "separation".</p>
<p>The ship, like a soldier marching on an expedition without looking back, sailed proudly towards Wusong. I was originally only focusing on waving my hand, and I myself was waving desperately for her to see, but now the ship was going further and further away, and it was impossible to distinguish a single target, so I had to wave wildly at the whole crowd, and there was no point in waving any further. So the three of us left like we had lost something, and we slowly left the pier with our heads lowered. When we walked to the road, we remembered that there were many wet and greasy things on our faces. Regardless of whether it was tear stains or rain, we should wipe it off! Lest people recognize that we had just returned from seeing off at the pier.</p>
<p>Where are Today's Literary Figures Going? By Hu Shanhu</p>
<p>Looking at the records in the newspapers and listening to the news in the publishing industry, it seems that those who mainly work by writing have reached a dead end, and it is unlikely that there will be a miraculous turn for the better.</p>
<p>To save foreign exchange, newspapers are reducing their page count; with fewer pages, news and advertisements must maintain their original state, and the first to be sacrificed are naturally the various supplements and special columns that depend on literary figures for their livelihood.</p>
<p>Printing costs are soaring, sales are not guaranteed, and regular periodicals and single-volume books are shrinking and decreasing as much as possible. Publishers say that only blank paper is valuable; once it is printed with words, it is worthless. They also say that closing the door and sitting idle is easier than opening the door and doing business.</p>
<p>Among the literary figures, some capable people who know the times have long stopped writing. Some have gone into politics. Although the salary of civil servants is not high, they are still officials of some kind, and everyone likes to be an official. There must be a reason for this, and it is better than being a literary figure with no way out. Some have gone into business, learning the ropes from scratch. Aren't the people who live the most luxurious lives in Shanghai businessmen? Those who have property simply close their doors and stay at home, ceasing writing altogether.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also literary figures who do not become officials, do not go into business, and have no constant property, but are still able to live, and live very well. However, there are not many such literary figures, and we cannot generalize the majority from the minority and say that literary figures still have such a good way out.</p>
<p>Those who change careers and abandon the position of a literary figure are no longer literary figures; those who do not change careers but appear as literary figures with the attitude of politicians have actually left the base of literary figures and cannot be counted as literary figures either. Therefore, today's literary figures are suffering from the inner torment of having nowhere to express their spirits and the external pressure of difficult lives, and are only struggling on the line of death, with no way out!</p>
<p>Where are today's literary figures going? Perhaps this is a question that everyone is concerned about!</p>
<p>But heaven never seals off all exits! Who says that today's literary figures have no way to go? In addition to changing careers or semi-changing careers, there is still a way to go!</p>
<p>To alleviate the pressure of life, I think it is not difficult, based on my experience during the War of Resistance. Passively, reduce the needs of life and implement cost-cutting; actively, do extra work that is not contrary to your profession and implement income-generating. During the War of Resistance, when my family was at its most difficult, I lived in a money shop, and my family mainly ate porridge, while I taught at four universities and two night schools, teaching thirty-nine classes per semester. Our family actually managed to cope with it this way.</p>
<p>To relieve spiritual depression, I think it is especially easy. If articles cannot be published, they can simply be accumulated. Articles that are only timely and not lasting are not of much value. Not writing articles can also be a preparation for writing articles: experienced writers can use this to collect materials, and young writers can use this to learn more. In addition, there is another very meaningful and enjoyable job that can be done, and that is to educate the next generation.</p>
<p>Older literary figures do not need to call themselves old writers and act like they are selling their age; but based on their own experience and knowledge, they should sincerely and calmly guide those immature and aspiring young people. The times are so bad, but we still have to prepare ourselves for a cultural restart, let alone the younger generation! We should look further and not forget them. Of course, we cannot have any prejudices when guiding them, so as not to destroy this promising next generation.</p>
<p>"To gain the talents of the world and educate them," therefore, educating the next generation is indeed the most enjoyable thing.</p>
<p>The above is what I said because I was thinking from the perspective of the literary figures themselves. For those who have changed careers or semi-changed careers, I only have hope that they can return to the position of literary figures. I dare not satirize or scold them, and I hope that the literary figures who have changed careers will not misunderstand.</p>
<p>This is a very serious era. All those who are literary figures, whether current literary figures or past literary figures (literary figures who have changed careers), should find a way out for themselves and for individuals. Satire or scolding are unnecessary.</p>
<p>Where are today's literary figures going? I am willing to throw a brick to attract jade in soliciting more valuable answers.</p>
<p>Meeting Yuanzhi and responding to Xin Hai's invitation, briefly describing Sullivan, suddenly having a glimpse, and despondently composing this, to the tune of Partridge Sky. By Yuli</p>
<p>Reflecting the image, a startled goose separates the spring seat, the person before me is the person from last year. Shoulder-to-shoulder sweet words are infinitely charming, swaying silver lamps are especially affectionate. Searching for old dreams, dreams are like dust, changing notes, a thousand layers of regret remain. When will I go to West Lake in a straw raincoat, repenting for all the love and anger in my heart!</p>
<p>Rhyming with Yuli's original poem by Guanya</p>
<p>Dreams are broken, the silver screen is dim, and there is no spring. The water flows and the flowers fall silently, with no one around. The soul melts before the treasure tree statue, I long for you, looking through Penglai after our farewell. The lotus turns to inches, the musk turns to dust, vainly shedding clear tears to stain new traces. Who pities the days of jade smiles and pearl fragrance, and even divines that love will turn to anger today!</p>

<p>Every inch of territory lost, an inch of blood shed. By Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Is there any way to get that Miss Pingzi here?" Mr. W asked.</p>
<p>"Maybe that woman is her... aunt?" Hu Cheng actually opened his mouth too. I thought he understood the topic we were discussing now; and he was someone who was not confused, so he would immediately think of the woman who threatened Mr. W's secret agency.</p>
<p>"Even if she's not here, we can still try!" I suddenly added this sentence.</p>
<p>"Oh!" He Jian understood.</p>
<p>"But? ... Yaoqun also seems to know what I'm up to."</p>
<p>"That's right," I found their surprise just now a little funny, "treat people in the same way they treat you... but this is also a last resort, and it's not entirely certain."</p>
<p>Only two people here might not understand my plan, one is Mr. W, I haven't known him for long after meeting him, and there hasn't been time to talk about my life story; so he doesn't know that I have some kind of trick. The other is Hu Chen, one is because he is young and lacks some knowledge; the other is because Yaoqun discussed the issue of spy technology with me the day before yesterday due to a chance opportunity. She said that she used to follow that foreign teacher and learned some preliminary applied psychology and understood some hypnotism, but unfortunately she didn't have time to practice, etc. But I advised her to give up on this; because this thing is not like other sciences, in addition to theory and design, other implementations are all on the material level. The subject of this thing is completely on the spiritual level; to put it mysteriously, it is completely a kind of "telepathy" effect. The control of this kind of telepathy, just like boxing skills, requires years of training and cultivation to have a little certainty. Moreover, there is also a big problem of whether a person's innate talent is suitable for this kind of cultivation. Hu Chen was not with us when I discussed this issue with Yaoqun, so he didn't know about it at all.</p>
<p>When I advised Yaoqun to give up on this, she had some doubts, so I had to tell her about my learning, experimentation, cultivation, and various experiences, and she believed it. So today, as soon as she heard me say that "there is a way", her thoughts were so quick that she guessed it immediately.</p>
<p>"Can it be done?" Yaoqun widened her beautiful eyebrows, as if recalling the content of the subject she had learned before.</p>
<p>"It can be done in a big way," I nodded to him. Then I told Mr. W and Hu Chen in a few simple sentences about the topic of my question and answer with her, so as not to leave them in the dark.</p>
<p>"I seem to remember a kind of 'remote suggestion' method..." Yaoqun was searching her memory.</p>
<p>"Almost there," I encouraged her to continue.</p>
<p>"...But remote suggestion requires that the subject has been suggested once or twice before it can perform special conduction, right? You don't even know how tall Miss Pingzi is, let alone how old she is?..."</p>
<p>"No, it doesn't matter much. We can use a transitional method for indirect conduction..." I was about to announce the method I planned; because at this time, Mr. W and He Jian, as well as Hu Cheng, were impatiently hoping that I would explain all the plans at once; especially Hong Jian, seeing me studying academic questions with Yaoqun in such a leisurely manner, wished he could give me a shot, but Yaoqun interrupted me again:</p>
<p>"Indirect conduction also requires a suitable medium. Isn't that right?"</p>
<p>"That's right, don't we have a ready-made medium here?" I glanced at He Jian, "Isn't Mr. He a ready-made transitional bridge? ... As long as I tell Brother He some simple 'self-hypnosis' methods and let him experiment, and then I will help from the side with my telepathy... I hope to connect to telepathy, and things will be easy to handle."</p>

<p>Tian Han's 50th birthday is being enthusiastically celebrated by the film and drama circles.</p>
<p>The contract between Shanghai Drama Society and "Guanghua" is difficult to continue because the front desk demanded too high a guarantee (the number was 6 million before the film price increase, and it needs to be doubled after the price increase), so "Shangju" will have no place to use its talents and will soon revive "Cronyism" as a farewell performance to the audience.</p>
<p>There is talk of Yuan Xuefen making a comeback.</p>
<p>"General" Sheng Jialun came from the Northeast by order, for several months, (once went to Hong Kong to order equipment) ate all over Shanghai, and said to people: "The things are delicious."</p>
<p>Fei Mu led a location shooting team to the Soviet Union, but this year's spring was cold, and the peach blossoms did not bloom. This trip yielded nothing, and he has now returned to Shanghai. It is said that the time for completing "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains" is expected to be extended by another year.</p>
<p>"Golden" Zhou Xinfang (Qilintong) announced that he will stage "Wen Tianxiang" soon and is stepping up rehearsals.</p>
<p>Geng Zhen had a lover in the rear. The woman was already married, but her husband had been studying in the United States for many years and could not be found. Unexpectedly, he recently returned from being gilded, and the couple repaired their old relationship. Lao Geng was disappointed and greatly "saddened."</p>
<p>He Xuechu and his wife recuperated in their hometown for several months. After returning, they underwent an X-ray fluoroscopy, and their lungs were very clear. Friends were happy for them.</p>

<p>Free Talk	Beethoven's Music is Further Away from You! By Wei</p>
<p>On the Conversion of Radio Prices in the Market</p>
<p>Would you like to listen to a Beethoven symphony?</p>
<p>Would you like to listen to a low-pitched love song by Bing Crosby?</p>
<p>Would you like to listen to Hollywood jazz music?</p>
<p>I believe you would. When you are quietly in front of a dim light, you will definitely want to turn on the radio you have on hand, select a radio station you like, and listen to your favorite songs, so that your irritable mind can be immersed in the mellow, sweet, and warm songs.</p>
<p>However, this kind of enjoyment in life, spiritual nourishment, we have now lost the only chance to comfort ourselves due to the heaviness of life. (Although, what I am talking about is only limited to the middle class, how can ordinary people talk about it?)</p>
<p>Before the war, radios were originally aristocratic entertainment items. A slightly better radio would cost around forty or fifty yuan to one hundred yuan. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the price of radios was much cheaper than before the war. Naturally, the RCA Philips radios from before the war cannot be bought now. Most of the radios used in the market as store promotions are new products from the United States after the war. These radios are all famous brands, with many names. Most of the large ones are samples, and the price of each one is around 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. There is no square box on the surface, and there are four or five vacuum tubes, but there are two problems: first, the filaments are easy to burn out, and generally have a lifespan of no more than one year, and second, many small radios cannot be repaired when they are broken, because Shanghai does not have these new sensor parts. Where are you going to repair them?</p>
<p>The reason why the United States wants to manufacture this batch of sample-style radios to dump to the mountain country is very simple. First, if good radios are sold first, who will want these radios with simple materials and short vacuum tube life in the future?</p>
<p>If the lifespan of this batch of sample radios is one year, then the later batch of better radios can follow up.</p>
<p>Radios similar to the Air King brand were all the rage for a while because you could have a radio with not-so-bad sound on your desk for only 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, which would satisfy your desire for radio programs to some extent. Isn't this a pleasant thing?</p>
<p>However, after this gold rush and foreign exchange adjustment, the prices of radios on the market have fluctuated greatly.</p>
<p>A small radio that used to cost around 200,000 yuan now sells for 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, jumping three times at once!</p>
<p>A new Philips shortwave radio will rise by more than double.</p>
<p>All materials such as No. 38 wire, earphones, vacuum tubes, and all radio parts have increased by an average of three times in price.</p>
<p>That is to say, a radio that was priced at 3,300 yuan in foreign exchange now has to be settled at 12,000 yuan.</p>
<p>During this conversion period, the radio jumped to a throne of three times the price.</p>
<p>A set of five-lamp vacuum tubes used to cost only 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, but now it costs more than 200,000 yuan. A Telefunken earphone used to cost only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, but now it costs more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Music, and all the broadcast programs that you are interested in, are further away from your life and more inaccessible.</p>
<p>If you feel very threatened by life, do you still have the spare time to purchase a radio that costs five or six hundred thousand or more than one million yuan?</p>
<p>This is almost a dream.</p>
<p>Recently, there is a kind of pocket radio on the market that uses Tiandi money (the large one uses a mineral device) and sells for 120,000 yuan, but the sound is small and weak. People who are obsessed with broadcasting will definitely not be satisfied, right?</p>
<p>Ingrid Bergman, the Actress Who is Popular in the Film Industry by Guohua</p>
<p>Sweden is a place that produces big stars. There was Garbo before, and Ingrid Bergman after. And Bergman's success has surpassed Garbo's. The first film that Shanghai audiences knew Bergman from was "Casablanca", the second was "The Bells of St. Mary's", and the third should be "Iron Heart Like Iron", which is about to be released at Dahua. According to the American "Vanity Fair" magazine: Last year (1946), there were nineteen films in Hollywood that were very popular, and the rental fee for each film was about 4 million US dollars. Bergman alone had four of them, with a total income of 21.75 million. The second was Bing Crosby, whose film rental income totaled 18 million. Among the nineteen films, the first to make money was naturally "The Bells of St. Mary's" starring Bergman and Bing Crosby.</p>
<p>Bergman also discussed "vampires" in another scene in "Iron Heart Like Iron" by Mai Ye</p>
<p>Ingrid Bergman also appeared on the Broadway stage. Her "Joan of Arc" made her win an unprecedented victory like Joan of Arc, conquering Broadway. According to the "Life" magazine report, as long as Bergman is willing to continue acting, this play can always sell well. From this point of view, it can be imagined that Bergman is popular in the film and drama circles.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a real "horrific news" occurred in Versailles, France: near this beautiful city, a "vampire" who came and went without a trace was discovered. He attacked women several times, stripping them naked and then biting their entire bodies, sucking human blood, putting their lives in danger. The latest telegram said that this "ghost" has been arrested. The case will be tried in the future, and the process is afraid that it will be more sensational than first-class detective novels and the most popular horror movies.</p>
<p>The telegram said it very briefly, but there is enough material for us to determine that this "ghost" is just a male sexual pervert. I believe that this criminal will be identified by psychologists using scientific methods to see if there is a hand disease in his brain, and it is very likely that he will be sentenced very lightly in the future, or even acquitted. He will not be sent to prison, nor will he be executed, but he will always have to stay in a mental hospital.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 18th century, there was a Marquis de Sade in France who wrote many novels. The male protagonists he described always liked to use various cruel methods on women, and the male protagonists themselves perversely obtained sexual satisfaction. His whipping of her was nothing more than the pursuit of sexual stimulation, and when the whipping reached its fiercest point, he would obtain sexual climax. During this period, no matter her screams, pain, or convulsions, ... none of them could help fuel his sexual lust. This is obviously a kind of perverted behavior. Later, people realized that the male protagonist in the novel was just the author's incarnation, and he himself had this kind of perverted sexual desire. Therefore, his name later simply became the sign of this kind of "pleasure" perverted sexual behavior, that is, the so-called "Sadism", which we usually translate as "sadism", "sadist", "sadist", etc.</p>
<p>As for stripping the woman's entire body before committing the crime, the motive is probably more of a manifestation of a perverted sexual behavior, and not just as a preliminary preparation for biting their entire bodies. We can easily speculate that the struggle and resistance of a woman being forced to strip naked by a thug, and the shock and horror she expresses emotionally when suddenly attacked, are in the eyes of the sadist, the ultimate "sexual stimulation." Perhaps, the pursuit of this stimulation is the purpose of his crime.</p>
<p>"Life" Magazine is About to Increase in Price by Hua</p>
<p>A long time ago, when I wanted to subscribe to "Shipping Digest", I asked the Dongya Bookstore, and the staff told me that it would cost six or seven US dollars a year (I don't remember clearly), and more than 20,000 in legal tender. I regret that I shouldn't have hesitated at the time and procrastinated until now. The day before yesterday, I went to ask, and it cost more than 90,000 in legal tender. I was hesitant before because of 20,000, but now I can only sigh at the "ocean" because of more than 90,000. If I can't subscribe to magazines, I can only buy one to see what's there, I bought a copy of "Life" magazine. The December 23rd international edition had already increased in price, but now it has fallen to 1,500 yuan, which made me feel happy when I bought it, as if I had bought some cheap goods. After that, I bought a copy of "Time" from January 27, but it cost me 4,000 yuan without discount. The staff replied to my question, "This is the new 'Time', when the new 'Life' comes, it will naturally increase in price!" After I bought it and read it in my small room, I felt that this "spiritual food" has really become a luxury, and it is not something that we, the national people of this country, can enjoy.</p>
<p>Writing here, I heard a squeaking sound from the rats on the bookshelf, as if they were saying to me, "Well, you are wearing tattered old clothes, you are living in dirty and dilapidated houses, you are a small person in an ancient country of two thousand years, ..."</p>
<p>I can only put down my pen.</p>
<p>Rescuing Child Prodigies - "Thoughts on Untitled" One of Many by Meng Long</p>
<p>Occasionally, I saw a gossip news item saying that it was rumored among the people in Guangxi that a new child prodigy had been discovered in Liujiang. Two years ago, he was only three years old, and he could already hum the sentence "The grass is green in Jiangnan for thousands of miles, kill the Japanese and return to Nanjing." At that time, the enemy's power was still rampant. Unexpectedly, in the summer and autumn of that year, Japan was indeed defeated, as predicted by this little poet, so they recognized him as a child prodigy.</p>
<p>It is said that this child prodigy, in terms of appearance, except for a protruding forehead, is the same as ordinary children and has no special characteristics. One common point is that he is living a miserable life eating grass roots and tree bark like other Guangxi children, and he has no nutrition at all, so his physical condition is very weak.</p>
<p>What aroused my curiosity was not the child prodigy's poem, but a tail at the end of this news item. It said: It is hoped that the government should find ways to educate the child prodigy, and in the future, he may become a special talent for the country.</p>
<p>I think: Whether the child prodigy can be called "divine", and whether the child prodigy's old poems have another ghostwriter, I will not discuss it for the time being, I will only talk about it based on the facts. Child prodigies are the same as ordinary children, and if they are not given nutrition, even if they are lucky enough not to die, the "protruding forehead" part will become more and more protruding. Even if they are lucky enough to be given nutrition, and in education, they still hum "The grass is green in Jiangnan for thousands of miles" and other kinds of stuff, at best, they can only create a monster in the old poetry world in the future - maybe this is the so-called "special talent"?</p>
<p>I see, this is not necessarily the case. "The grass is green in Jiangnan for thousands of miles", although it cannot be said that it is not a line of poetry, but such a line of poetry, in the eyes of adults, is already "a headache". Is it really "once is too much, can it be repeated?" I am afraid that if he hums like this, his destiny will at most begin with "child prodigy" and end with "child prodigy" - why? It is because he matures and dies early.</p>
<p>In a word: Rather than save a "special talent", it is better to save thousands upon thousands of ordinary children!</p>
<p>Film Talk Iron Heart Like Iron by Liu</p>
<p>For the sake of the call of two famous actors, Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman, I believe it is a work cherished by the audience.</p>
<p>However, because of the emptiness of the content itself, although it is strange and painted with mysterious colors, its evaluation cannot surpass the recently unanimously praised "Madame Curie".</p>
<p>Although "Madame Curie" is just a scientific biographical film, it has content, inspiration, and complete form. It should get the honor it deserves.</p>
<p>"Iron Heart Like Iron" is not the case. Its content only tells the story of a husband with a perverted mentality who is preparing to murder his wife. In terms of content, it is overhead. Moreover, the development of the story is not rigorous and complete enough. Therefore, the organization of the whole film is not very reasonable. For example, it is not very clever for the young policeman to rashly enter the heroine's inner room and immediately reveal the secret of the whole play.</p>
<p>Director George Cukor, although a master (he has directed films such as "Gaslight"), is limited by the limitations of the story and cannot exert his best. This is a pity.</p>
<p>However, the director can grasp most of the atmosphere. The initial warmth, the mist, and the gas street lamps are all very strong.</p>
<p>Bergman and Boyer's acting skills are excellent and pure. It is definitely worth seeing.</p>

<h3>Chinatown "Mayor" Talks About Recent Events of Overseas Chinese - Li Zhenhui Insistently Asks Mayor Wu to Smoke a Cigar</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Fellow countrymen in the motherland may not be very familiar with him, but among the overseas Chinese in New York, almost no one doesn't know Li Zhenhui - this Mr. Li, praised as the "Mayor" of New York's Chinatown, was born and raised in the United States for sixty years. He only stayed in China for eighteen months during his first return to the country. This time, he was delighted to make his second visit to the motherland, and he felt especially happy to meet the mayor of Shanghai the day before yesterday. The "Mayor" Li, who smokes ten cigars a day, didn't want to enjoy the pleasure of cigars alone, and insisted that Mayor Wu put down his pipe and try a cigar as well, and then he began his interesting conversation.</p>
<p>Li's English name is Shaney (Shave Head). He knows that people will find it strange why he uses this special name, so he always tells everyone that when he was little, his father often shaved his head completely. At school, his classmates didn't know what his name was, and when they saw his bald head, they called him Shayey. From then on, no one knew his real English name except for "Bald Head".</p>
<p>At the same time, because he smokes ten cigars every day, his friends gave him the nickname "Five times Five".</p>
<p>New York's Chinatown currently has six thousand overseas Chinese, who have been living and working in peace under the leadership of "Mayor" Li for the past twenty years. In addition, all 30,000 overseas Chinese in New York regard "Mayor" Li as their leader. At the same time, he also holds an important position in the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of America. Almost all overseas Chinese in the United States are members of this association, and it bears a very large responsibility, including organizing Chinese education so that every Chinese child attends Chinese school after finishing school in the United States. During our country's war of resistance, the association mobilized every overseas Chinese to donate five U.S. dollars per month to contribute to the motherland. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association is also responsible for helping unemployed overseas Chinese. During the period of economic depression in the United States, the U.S. government organized relief for unemployed people throughout the United States and provided them with jobs, but very few Chinese went to ask for relief because they helped each other and sought ways out.</p>
<p>The most admirable thing is that it is rare for overseas Chinese in the United States to go to court to file lawsuits. If disputes occur between families, they often hold family meetings to discuss and resolve them. If they cannot be resolved, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association will mediate or adjudicate.</p>
<p>Representative Li brought a common saying from overseas Chinese in the United States, especially the elderly, to the fellow countrymen in the motherland. He said, "Most of them grew up in the United States and have never seen the motherland. Their greatest hope at present is to be able to return to the motherland once. The elderly all hope to return and sleep in the ground of the motherland." Overseas Chinese crowd to board ships back to the country every day, but unfortunately, there are few ships and many people, and transportation is inconvenient.</p>
<p>Finally, "Mayor" Li expressed his deep admiration for Mayor Wu. He believes that Mayor Wu has the talent of New York Mayor LaGuardia and has the same courage, but Mayor Wu's environment and the various measures he needs to cope with are actually more difficult and arduous than those of Mayor LaGuardia.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanchang on the 21st] The cause of the student unrest at Zhongzheng University was first initiated by students from the College of Engineering because the candidates for the dean and department heads have not yet been appointed, which led to this student unrest.

<h3>India Answers Our Government's Protest - Pan-Asian Conference - Purely a Cultural Organization - Does Not Invite Countries to Participate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, on the 21st] It is reported that the Chinese government has lodged an informal protest with India because India invited Tibet to attend the Pan-Asian Conference. The Chinese government also pointed out that Tibet is a part of the Republic of China, and India's invitation to Tibet is actually insulting. However, according to the Indian side, the Chinese government's protest is unnecessary because the invitation to Tibet was issued by Indian Prime Minister Nehru in his personal capacity as the president of the Indian Council of World Affairs and does not represent the Indian government. It was also pointed out that the conference is a purely cultural organization and does not invite countries to participate. For example, six or seven Soviet federations were invited, but the Soviet Union was not included in the invitation.</p>

<h3>Yangzheng Will Hold a Memorial Service - For a Forty-Year-Old Teacher</h3>

He taught at Yangzheng Elementary School for more than 40 years, tirelessly. He died of illness on the 19th of last month at the age of 75. It is reported that Mr. Cao wrote a self-eulogy before his death, saying: "Having lived in the world for seventy-five years, I have protected the Confucian temple and managed the ancestral hall. I have worked hard to assist schools and have wholeheartedly cultivated them. I have never planned for personal gain and have always sought public welfare. My intention is sincere, and I have tried my best to be a human being. I have encountered three or four disturbances, including internal strife and foreign insults. The Jin Dynasty was completely destroyed, and there was no home to return to. In my later years, I lost my sight and suffered from hemiplegia. Heaven has repaid me in this way, could it be the karma of a previous life?" Qian Xuanqing, the principal of Yangzheng, said that Mr. Cao had a clear conscience, was selfless and strict, was kind to people throughout his life, and was upright in his dealings with the world. Reading his sad words at the end of the year, I sigh at Heaven's lack of sympathy.
