<h3>美方退三人小組　宣布放棄調處工作　執行部人員亦全部撤離</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務院頃宣布：與調解中國內戰有關之駐華美海軍陸戰隊，不久即將撤退。國務院稱：美政府當局認爲繼續努力調停中國黨爭，徒然浪費時間與精力。此項意見興美政府正式放棄調解國共爭端之聲明有關。國務院續稱：美國已決定終止與三人小組之關係，並撤退軍調總部之美方人員，彼等不久即將離開軍調總部。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕美國務院新聞專員麥杜莫，發表國務院之聲明稱：美國現正退出調停國共爭義之一切努力。麥氏答覆問話稱，關於在華美國海軍陸戰隊，「將按照已核准之美方停止參加軍調部計劃，稍緩發出訓令」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕美大使館發言人康納士，廿九日下午六時宣布，美政府已决意终止其與軍事三人小組及軍調部之聯緊，軍調部美方人員將儘速撤離。按軍事三人小組係馬歇爾。張羣。周恩來等所組成，原設重慶，由馬帥任主席，軍調部即由該小組所組織，設於北平，三方面人選，係去歲一月十一日決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕美大使館發言人康納士，廿九日午後六時於大使館發表聲明稱：「美國政府業經決定終止與軍事三人小組之關連，該小組係於重慶成立，目的在終止中國之衝突，該小組之主席則爲馬歇爾元帥。美國政府並決定終止與軍事調處執行部之關連，軍事調處執行部係軍事三人小組決定於北平成立者，目的在就地督導停戰協定復員及全國武裝部隊之整編協定之實施，軍事調處執行部所屬美方人員，將儘速撒退」。</p>
<p>司使向政府及中共　轉達美方决定辦法</p>
<p>該發言人並稱：廿九日午後四時半，美大使司徒雷登晋見蔣主席，曾轉達美政府是項決定。同日午後五時半，司徒大使並於大使館接見中共王炳南氏，請其將是項决定轉達延安。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿九日電〕美大使館宣布，终止其對北平軍調部之關連，實際上美國已完全結束其對於中國内戰之調處。由吉倫中將領導之軍調部美國人員將儘速撤退，屬於軍調部之美國人員約三千人，包括空運隊之運輸人員，屬於軍調部之海軍陸戰隊乃擔任運輸給養者及少數擔任守衛之任務者，亦同時撤退。軍調部於一九四六年一月十三日開始執行停戰協定，迄今適約一年。各觀察家咸信，軍調部不久將結束，馬歇爾在華盛頓討論之後，今日乃有上述之決定，此無異美國完全放棄對中國內戰之調解，而取消戰塲上唯一可能阻止戰火之因素，中國政府與中共，恐不久亦將撤退其在北平軍調部以及各地執行小組之人員。</p>
<h3>軍調部決定撤銷　吉倫保證送返中共人員　華北美軍下月內將撤退</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕美國務院宣布撤回三人小組及軍調部人員後，廿九日下午五時，軍調部美方委員吉倫將軍召集政府參謀長蔡文治，中共委員葉劍英（薛子正代表出席）舉行會議，即以美國務院所宣布者通知國共兩方，三方當決定撤銷軍調部，惟具體辦法尙待繼續開會討論。政府委員鄭介民猶滯京未歸，參謀長蔡文治對此事不贊一詞，共方發言人則稱：此乃時局自然發展之結果，無足驚奇，馬歇爾回國時，軍調部之命運，殆已決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿九日電〕軍調部美方委員吉倫將軍，今日通知政府與中共委員，美國已決定退出該停戰機構。吉倫同時保證，「美方將以必要時間，協助中共人員，送返任何地點。」預料美方人員及眷屬將立即開始撤退，約匝月可畢。軍調部美方部份，有官兵及軍中婦女服務員的一千人，並有官兵至少一百廿五人之眷屬亦在北平，另有眷屬廿一人，已乘美陸軍運輸船惠吉爾號定卅日到塘沽，美方部份執行小組及聯絡隊分散華北與東北各地，但料美方人員返平不致遭遇困難。執行小組華北有十六組，東北有八組，飛機均可到達。美方人員雖將立即開始撤退，仍擬保持充分人數，至北平軍調部及長春前進分部中共代表均返共區爲止，現政府控制區內各小組，已無中共代表，而中共區內各小組，亦無政府人員。美方部份在中國有大量配備，分散各地，但均有充分撤退之準備。軍調部成立不久，即會擬定三種撤退計劃，內兩種擬於緊急時實施，第三種較綏，此次必將實行此種計劃無疑，內規定將在華官兵及眷屬曁婦女服務員有系統的調往太平洋如朝鮮·日本·非律濱及其他島嶼，或返美國，繼續担任陸軍職務，所有配備，在緊急時必將棄留者，此次亦將運出。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿九日電〕軍調部美方人負四千名及留駐華北衛護軍調部設施之美海軍陸戰隊第一師官兵八千名，將悉數撤退。美陸海軍及陸戰隊人員撤退後，在華美軍將僅剩駐南京之軍事顧問團，該團連同海軍部份在內，所有官兵，不出七百五十人。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿九日電〕華北美陸戰隊及陸軍航空隊第三三二分隊，將於最近撤離中國。通常消息靈通方面預料，在下月之內，華北美軍勢將絕跡。因不論軍調部，本身解散與否，美方代表旣已撤離，則陸戰隊亦無繼續留華之理由，充其量在靑島留駐少數人員，協助美國海軍訓練中國海軍學生而己。</p>
<h3>羅隆基談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美方宣布退出三人小組及調處執行總部及撤退與調處工作有關之海軍陸戰隊後，民盟發言人羅隆基氏發表感想如次：美國退出三人小組及調處執行部，爲馬帥回國後之當然結果，同時亦表示美國在華之調停工作已吿一段落。希望國人今後能自己努力，致力於促進和平，解決自身之問題。同時，中美邦交素稱敦睦，今後希望美國站在友誼立塲上，帮助我國進行和平建設</p>
<h3>中共將有反響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃詢問中共辦事處對於美方行動之感想，答謂：延安對此事將有正式反饗。</p>
<h3>政府聲明全文　已送達美使館</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕中宣部彭部長廿九日四時，在記者招待會中發表政府對共產黨拒絕和談之聲明全文（見中央社稿），記者詢以此項聲明是否已送達美使館，彭答：然。復詢以政府此項聲明中，所表示政府今後唯一方針爲改組政府，未悉各黨派是否均能參加，如暫不參加，是否保留其名額？彭答：靑年·民社兩黨，政府自盼其能來參加，至共黨與民盟是否保留其名額，留待將來再行老慮。中英商的內無此規定</p>
<h3>內河航行　並不開放</h3>
<p>中英商約內無此規定</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二十九日電〕外傳我政府於商訂中英商約時，將重新予英商以內河航行及沿海貿易權之說，中央社記者頃向政府方面探悉，絕對不確。</p>
<h3>美方退出軍調部工作　未能促成我和平　某政治觀察家發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自美方正式宣佈放棄調處工作，退出軍事三人小組，調處執行總部，及撤退與調處工作有關之駐華海軍陸戰隊後，本市某權威政治觀察家發表感想如次：</p>
<p>美國此次決定，顯屬因美國人民及當局未明瞭中國政治進展之正確情形所致。我國政治之不能走上團結和平之路者，主因在於中共之堅持不合作不參加和談不參加政府，並牽制其他政黨採取同樣之態度。中共如繼續堅持此種立塲，則中國甚難實現眞正之團結。中國正當人民深知美國在戰時曾予我各種寳貴之援助，勝利後從未要求美軍早日撤回，歷次所謂要求美軍撤退之行動，顯然均有人幕後主動，絕不能代表眞正之民意。今美方突然撤軍，不免使人認作爲此等有背景有企圖之人所利用，而此種突然之行動，在事實上不但不能促進中國之和平與團結，反使一般破壞和平而有野心之人，勢力更趨增長。</p>
<h3>政府決擴大基礎　盼各黨各派均參加工作</h3>
<p>對中共拒絕和談事特發表重要聲明</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕中宜部長彭學沛，於廿九日下午六時記者招伶會中，宜布國民政府對于中共拒絕和平談判之聲明，原文如次：自去年十一月八日，政府發布停戰令以來，至今已將三月，在此期間，共產黨不惟不共同遵守停戰，而且乘此時機，自東北以至隴海路東段，發動全面攻勢，至今且變本加厲。政府爲切期和平，故一再忍讓，委曲求全，爲國家與人民保存一綫生機，期達政治解決之目的，不料共產黨對于政府派遣代表前往延安商討恢復和談之提議，旣已正式拒絕於先，今復拒絕政府所提四條之和平方案，殆爲莫大之遺憾。政府鑒于最近召開之國民大會，已根據政治協商會議，共同所訂之原則，而已制定民主憲法。更鑒于政府之改組方案正在積極商談與籌備之中，使各黨派均能參加國府委員會及立法，行政，監察等各院部會之工作，以期實現擴大政府之基礎。故曾于本月廿四日商請司徒博士，以政府下列四點之願望，轉知中國共產黨：（一）政府願意派員赴延安或請中共派員來京，繼續進行商談或舉行圓桌會議，邀請各黨派及社會賢達參加。（二）政府與中共雙方立即下令就現地停戰，幷協議關於停戰之有效辦法。（三）整編軍隊及恢復交通，政府仍願根據三人會議過去協議之原則，繼續商談軍隊駐地整編程序以及恢復交通之實施辦法。（四）在憲法實施以前，對于有爭執區域之地方政權，政府願意與中共商定公平合理之解決途徑。今中共旣已正式拒絕和談，幷聲稱，政府必須首先同意其所提之恢復去年一月十三日以前之軍事位置，及廢除國民大會所通過之憲法，此無異要求國民政府與國民大會皆受制於共黨，惟共黨之命是從，將置中華民國國家與人民於何地？自去年政治協商會議與軍事三人小組會議開會以來，在此一年期間，政府實已盡其所能，企待中共與各黨派共同參加政府，而終無法獲得其諒解，至此自不能再望其參加。中共旣作如此決絕之表示，則今後惟一可循之途徑，亦惟有貫澈政府政治民主化之旣定方針與步驟，尙期各黨派與社會賢達，一本其愛國愛民之熱忱參加政府，使憲政準備早日完成，而憲政能如期實施，並望一心一德，從事建設，恢復經濟，改善一般人民之生活，共同努力於建國之大業，此爲政府今後之唯一方針也。</p>
<h3>民社黨中常會　討論參加政府</h3>
<p>吳鐵城日內即行返京</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕觀察家指出：民社</p>
<h3>中常會例會通過　各部會組織規程</h3>
<p>三中全會提案委會分四組工作</p>
<p>〔本報南克廿九日電〕中常會廿九日上午十時在中央黨部召開例會，出席卅餘人，陳立夫主席，首對時局現狀交換意見甚久，次通過三中全會提案委會組織條例，該委會計分黨務·政治·經濟·憲政四組，由各中常委自任一組或兩組，幷通過縣級執行委會組織規程及中央各部會紙織規程等案。</p>
<p>靑年兩黨之參加政府改組，在目前各有其困難。以民社黨而論，黨內一部份爲理想主義者，另一部份爲現實主義者，對改組政府各有看法，難於獲致協議。而張君勒氏學者風度，並未行使其應有之最後決定權。以靑年黨而言，參加政府亦有三大困難，即：（一）地方政府改組問題。（二）政府人選問題。（三）不願單獨參加政府。故除非局勢變化或政府讓步，短期內難望有具體結果。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨中常會於昨日續開，但因黨內對參加政府之觀點，未能一致，經激烈辯論後，仍無具體決定。現擬休息數日，再行商討。惟民社黨內部對於建立責任內閣制，採用人才主義一點，則衆議僉同。而此種政制之精神，亦與憲法上所規定者一致。又該黨對改組政府，應自中央着手，此與靑年黨之要求地方政府同時改組者不同。關於恢復和談一節，黨內亦認爲和平爲人民基本之要求，如有機會，應隨時不放過，不論在改組政府前或改组政府後。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年黨昨開中常會，除在滬常委全體出席外，滯京常委除曾琦因事留京外，亦返滬参加。會議中主要為檢討内部工作，及留京常委之報吿。一部份常委擬於會後赴杭州嘉興游覽。又左舜生，李璜，定昨日夜車晋京。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽廿九日電〕蘇軍查列斯基少將與國軍周璞上校等會談之內容，據聞蘇方曾與我約定此後雙方聯絡辦法。又在會談中，國軍曾要求蘇方將其警戒綫以內共軍繳械，忠實履行中蘇友好條約，並協助國軍會剿普蘭店以南共軍，聞蘇方謂，石河站以南蘇軍警戒綫內旅大一帶，並無共軍。</p>

<p>（二）中共宣稱，最近三個月之戰况，於彼等有利，有事實根據吾？自十一月一日以來，政府所失或所得者爲何地？在此時期內，政府軍隊之傷亡如何？彭答：諸君從報紙紀載，當知共產黨揚言有吾根據。國軍在各處均稱順利，在魯南共軍雖企圖作孤注一擲，但國軍預有把握，吾人目的在於國家之統一與和平，故於城市之逐漸收復，不欲過事宣傳，唯諸君旣有要求，余當請軍事當局於不久將來發表一詳表。關於傷亡尚無詳細統計。（三）由共宣稱，蔣鼎文將軍赴美進行談判，俾自菲律賓及印度接收大批軍火之說，是否屬實？彭答：此為完全之製造。（四）政府是否如外界所傳，限制白報紙之進口？彭答：一切進口均須經政府之准許，今年報紙可輸入若干，尚未確定。</p>
<p>西沙事件</p>
<p>（五）據傳法軍於西沙羣島之兩小島登陸，政府已採取何種步驟？（六）中國政府關於此事，曾向法國政府正式有所表示否？以上二問，外部次長劉　答稱：就中國政府所知，有若干法軍自一巡邏艇登鹽於西沙羣島之拔陶兒島，武　島則無人登陸，今日余可報告者　僅此而已。惟本人擬借今日之機會，鄭重否認法外部之聲明謂中國於一九三八年同意法國占領西沙羣島，中國於彼時僅重申其一向之立塲，中國對該羣島之主權爲無可爭辯者。</p>
<p>越南華僑</p>
<p>（七）中國政府是否計劃撤退法屬越南尤其河內一地之華僑？劉答：中國政府正在籌劃恢復中國與越南間之航空交通，倘能獲得法當局之同意，吾人希望於南寗及河內間有民航飛機之往返，以作救濟之用。中國政府正以種種方法，將米糧等供給河內及海防之華僑，並使彼等與國內有航空交通之聯絡。河內法當局亦在設法，以米，鹽，乾魚等物品救濟華僑。</p>

<h3>定縣新樂相繼被陷　共軍大與窺保定　冀南國軍收復南樂縣城</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕軍方證實，平漢北段之定縣，經數日激戰後，共軍於廿七日晚攻破城垣，巷戰一夜。廿八日午完全陷共軍手，城內大火數處，重要建築正遭破壞中，千餘守軍與四百護路警，一百六十餘鐵路員工，以及定縣黨政軍人員均下落不明，此爲冀省屢次縣城攻防戰損失最大之一次。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕平漢北段新樂縣城亦證實失陷，石家莊北之正定與辛安兩車站，昨起被攻後，今晨亦失去聯絡。辛安，東畏壽兩軍尙隔木刀溝激戰中，故該二車站或不致失守，保定至正定間除木刀溝尙有戰事外，二百五十里間已完全入共軍控制，國軍一個師自察境關來，向保定增援，今晨因平保段北河店，固城間鐵路再被破壞六處，阻於該地。保定南子家莊間昨起亦發生激戰，國軍正待機南下，石家莊國軍集中後，可保無虞。某軍之一個師，日內亦可望沿正太綫到石，空輸增援，亦計劃中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕冀省局勢因共軍二次在保石間之大攻勢，頓現惡劣，保石段搶修計劃成泡影。關係當局談；共軍此次攻勢，乃呼應晋魯而作之全面攻勢，其主要目的爲破壞鐵路及摧毁國軍據點，一俟國軍援軍開到，共軍將再不戰自退。叧據有資格觀察家稱：冀省之短期混亂將不可免，以現勢言，再增二個軍，當可挽回頺勢，和談旣陷絕望，惟有以實力決定，未來打通津浦·平漢兩路，乃政府必採手段，津浦·平漢兩路相較，前者重於後者，故平漢綫之恢復，尙有待於魯南會戰結束。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕津浦沿綫之交河，開到共軍五千餘人，靑縣亦開到二千餘人，滄縣國軍正注視其次一行動。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕據飛機偵察，共軍正動員大量民伕，積極破壞定縣·東長壽間之鐵路橋樑，所有大小鐵石木橋均被炸毁，路基齒形相錯，排成深溝，鐵軌材料枕木均燒毀，損失之大，非數字所可計出。又春汛不久即到，前被炸毁臨時架起之便橋勢須重修，以防春汛，此亦爲搶修工作中一大困難。</p>

<h3>郝鵬舉一度抵徐　謁陳總長等當日返海州　戰事重心已移魯豫邊境</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿九日電〕新任魯南綏靖區司令官兼第四十二集團軍總司令郝鵬舉，率政治部主任劉澄，廿九日午自海州乘專機抵徐，陳總長，薛主任均派員到機塲歡迎，郝等下機後，即同往綏署謁陳總長，薛主任，報吿所都現狀，並有所請示，陳總長，薛主任留共進午餐，席間對郝之効忠政府，慰勉有嘉，午後三時郝等一行原機返海州，記者晤郝於徐州機塲，據稱：政府已走向民主之途，若再事內亂，徒損耗國家元氣，摧殘人民幸福，第四十二集團軍現集结海州，贛楡一帶，即向魯南展開綏靖工作。郝並謂：陳毅對渠監視極嚴，渠能安然率部効忠政府，足徵陳之力量衰竭，末日已臨，郝對徐州所予渠之熱誠歡迎，感奮莫名，謂今後惟有努力綏靖魯南，達成任務，以圖報効。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江廿九日電〕蘇魯邊陬之戰局，已完全好轉，國軍業確保隴海東路之徐海段安全，並堅强掌握由台兒莊通往隴海東路之趙墩站全綫，台莊守軍因無後顧之愛，扼守益力，外傳共軍正猛攻台莊，並發生激戰等說。已證明不確。戰事重心現已移至魯豫邊陬，國軍勁旅正由東西兩路向隴海綫之蘭封·民權·碭山·黄口等地源源增援。據軍界有資格之人士談，共軍如不迅速停止魯豫邊陬之攻勢，必重蹈一年前在豫東，魯西慘敗之覆轍，可以斷言。</p>

<h3>社論　祝賀缅甸的新生</h3>
<p>英政府於一昨發表白皮書宣布英緬談判所成立的協議：（一）緬甸以自治領地位留於大英帝國範圍之內，抑或脫離一切關係完全獨立自主，悉由緬甸自行決定；（二）緬甸應於四月間選舉國民大會制定憲法，國民大會代表應完全屬諸緬甸人；（三）在新憲法施行之前，緬甸應組織臨時政府，內設一行政院由緬甸人任之及總督一人由英人任之，此與印度情形相同；（四）原則上承認緬甸在過渡時期得管理其財政，並得指揮全部緬甸軍隊；（五）新憲法施行後，英國駐軍應如何處理，由英緬成立協定處理之；（六）緬甸疆界容後釐定。同時，英首相艾德禮，印度緬甸事務大臣勞倫斯勳爵亦分別在下院及貴族院宣布英緬會談的結果。由於英政府有此項官式的宣布，奠定了緬甸自主新生的基礎。在經過一個極短的過渡時期，制定了緬甸的根本大法以後，緬甸必將開始它的新生。中國與緬甸不但地壤相接，而且情同手足，對於緬甸的得到新生，行將獨立自主，我們表示無限的欣慰；佳訊傳來，我們謹於此向緬甸人民表示我們衷誠的祝賀。</p>
<p>此次英緬會談的召開，初由英首相艾德禮於十二月二十日宜布於國會，於一月十三日起舉行於倫敦，緬甸以其政務委員會的副主席烏安商爲代表團長前往英京，參與會談。本報前於獲悉是項消息之際，曾以「緬甸獨立的新曙光」爲題，對緬甸的獨立及英緬會談的召開有所論列，認為此項會談召開的本身，即是一件令人喜慰的事，因爲「這表示一個統治民族與一個被統治民族爲了他們將來關係的調整，願以商談的方式來解決所有的一切問題。這表示一個統治民族願以和平的方式來變更它所處的地位，以期滿足被統治民族的願望；同時，也表示一個被統治民族之願以和平方式來滿足他們的願望。這次英緬商談的召開，本身就是協和精神的表現，是値得我們稱頌的」。我們又說：「我們相信英緬雙方旣有和平解決緬局的意願，則即將在倫敦召開的英緬會談前途定必成功」。如今從倫敦傳來的消息，證實了英緬會談的成功，使我們的願望爲不虛；我們於此不能不深佩英緬雙方的領袖之具有卓越的才識和政治家的風度。</p>
<p>東南亞的各民族類多文化古國，祗因十九世紀以來，因西歐帝國主義的抬頭，於是相繼淪亡，此在各該地的民族自然都表憤慨。西歐各帝國主義以他們優越的武力在東南亞各地維持了他們的統治。第一次世界大戰之後，民族主義的高洲蔓延及於東南亞的各被統治民族；可是威爾遜總統十四點裏的民族自決，與西歐帝國主義的利益相衝突，東南亞各被統治民族的地位，依舊不能有所改善，美國對於菲列賓的統治，早知有結束的一天，故在珍珠港事變以前，早有允許菲列賓獨立的諾言，等到日本投降，此項諾言，便立即兌現，在東南亞各被統治民族裏，因此，我們首先看見有非列賓的獨立。在荷印，印度尼西亞的民族遝動，於日本降降以後，更趨積極，現在荷蘭與印度尼西亞之間雖還沒有成立協議；但觀乎印度尼西亞民族運動的澎湃，印度尼西亞人民的願望，必遲早有實現的一天。在這個時候，我們看見有英緬會談的成功，另一個東南亞被統治的民族如今又達到它獨立自主的目的。</p>
<p>我們於此自不能不深佩艾德禮政府所取政策的賢明。由於這」賢明政策的採取，大英帝國的力量不但沒有削弱，抑或將更因而增强，在帝國內有不安的部分是足以削弱帝國力量的。艾德禮看准這一點，以遠大的眼光准許緬甸的完全獨立自主，它是否在大英帝國內取道米寗的地位，抑或脫離大英帝國完全獨立緬甸可以自行決定。這不能不設英國所抱熊度的寬大。在事實上，當今世界多事之秋，英國雖准許緬甸脫離帝國而獨立，但緬甸爲了它本身的利益是否願意出此，也實在是一個問題。對於緬甸將來的地位，雖尙有待於此後國民大會的召開；然而現有的跡象似乎在指出一宗事實，就是緬甸也許還在英帝國內取得一種如加拿大澳大利亞那樣的道米寗地位，因爲這對於緬甸似乎是最有利的。大英帝國在實質上是一種「共榮圈」，緬甸爲了它本身的利益，似乎不會離此而獨立。</p>
<p>由於緬甸問題的解決，使我們不得不想起越南的局勢。自河內北折一帶發生武裝鬥爭以來，法政府對於處理越南事件的態度一味採取强硬政策，施以高壓。越南總督的作風，十足表現了早期帝國主義者的面目，應知民族運動的滋長發育，有時雖或因外力而遭　頓挫；但沒有一個民族能以武力長久統治另一民族，這遲早是要失敗的。最近法國政府又有變動，我們願他們在越南問題的處理上能够採取更開明的政策，使越南人民的願望也能得到滿足，使遠東的持久和平，能够得以維　。</p>
<h3>日本賠償物資　全部由我自運　俟美國務卿批准後即可啓運</h3>
<p>龔學遂之談話</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十九日電〕行政院賠償委會主委龔學遂、二十九日晨談：日本賠償我國之五十餘萬噸物資，俟美國國務卿馬歇爾批准後，即可啓運來華，此類物資，將由我國船隻自運，其中三分之一由招商局運輸，餘者則由其他航業公司負責，預計的兩個月可運竣。此類物資之處理，將不專設任何新機構，而由各接受機關分別料理。龔氏相信整個日本賠償問題之解決不致拖延過久，渠認四强外長會議閉幕後，歐洲問題吿一段落，各國即將商討遠東事務，賠償問題自將提出，屆時我將就整個賠償問題，提出意見。蘇聯在東北所運走之物資，其數目正由敵產處理局作不完全之調查中，將來亦當提出。又我國爲處理賠償問題所指派之五人代表團，已由原在日本之人員中選出五人組成，該團將負責與盟軍總部等機關聯絡，任期二年，菲島亦有五人代表團赴日。至龔氏本人赴日之期，則須視大連接收遲早而定。</p>

<p>各國代表關心　黄泛區域善救</p>
<p>昨日會議中，各國代表對於中國黄泛區及中共區之救濟及供應物資，均極關心。行總調查處長向景雲，黄泛區善後救濟小組委員會主任凌道揚，及農業善救組主任格里等，相繼報吿該區泛濫及救濟情形，據格氏稱：河南，安徽，及江蘇三省，受水患之土地，達二百三十餘萬畝，被影響縣份共三十六縣，該會組有（一）農業及移民，（二）工業及運輸，（三）社會及經濟，（四）公共衛生四小組委員會，從事工作，目前主要目的，在使如此廣大良田，儘速恢復墾殖，其緊要步驟有三：（一）淸除積水，並整理農田；（二）大量搜運種子，估計今春共須種子七萬七千噸；（三）農民食糧必須準備供給其他如房屋及醫藥品等亦所需要。</p>
<p>聯總遣散組組長賈克塞本氏，報吿各國難民遣送情形。關於中國難民之遣送，略謂：在去年度經遣送返南洋各島難民之原籍者，計有六九四四人，截止本年一月底止，則共計八七〇〇人。此外，旅外華僑由義大利遣送返國者。計五七七人，由新幾內亞遺送返國者，計八〇三人，再加由菲列賓遣送返國之難民，共計六四七一人，本年一二月間因戰亂關係，可能再自安南送回三〇〇人，其全部遣送之數在一萬六千人左右。聯總茲已特撥六千四百萬美元，作爲遣送中國難民之經費，但難民在收養所內，等候護照出境，往往需費甚多時日，故此項支出，在聯總實爲一大負担，希望各方面多予協助。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿八日電〕美參院原子能委會本日舉行會議，討論各種安全措施，藉以使一切關於製造原子彈之情報，得以保守秘密。共和黨議員米里金宣稱，本委會必須牢記，其他各國對於原子武器均極度表示關切。美原子能委會主席李林泰爾則謂，安全措施必須絕對嚴格，俾防止原子秘密之洩漏，美陸軍曾於去年公布原子能技術報吿書，殊屬非是。麥克瑪洪參議員亦提議一切關於原子彈之情報，應向原子能委會宣布，此在范登堡參議員對化，則表示異議，因而兩氏爭辯頗烈。</p>

<h3>英內閣開會　檢討修約建議　塔斯社又抨擊英政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿八日電〕英政府本日在此舉行閣議，傳各閣員曾討論史達林修改英蘇協定之建議，傳貝文外相昨會接見蘇大使柴魯平，作具體商談。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕莫斯科無綫電臺今日復廣播塔斯通訊社評論英國對蘇政策之文，謂英國對蘇政策不能云爲適合英蘇盟約之原則與需要，外國各報對於最近英首相貝文與史達林元帥交換之交件，多所論列，就實際言，其中殊多英美兩國似已結合抵抗蘇聯之例證云。</p>
<h3>南太平洋會議　推定正副主席</h3>

<h3>美政府譴責波蘭　認為選舉不符自由原則　聲明目前不擬與之絕交</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕國務院本日發表聲明正式譴責波蘭臨時政府，在最近之普選中對民主份子，施用普遍之高壓及威脅手段，波蘭政府不能信守舉行自由選舉之神聖諾言。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國今日聲明不承認波蘭本月十九日國會選舉，責其政府行爲不當，但美國駐華沙使節仍擬予以保留，換言之，美國不與波蘭立即絕交，僅保留充分行動自由，以便決定將來對波蘭政府之態度。美國究將採取何種對付辦法，目下並無跡象可尋，但可能採取經濟措置，甚至召回美波大使藍恩。藍氏可被召回國「述職」，並不正式斷絕外交關係。上項聲明係經國務卿馬歇爾核准後，由國務院發表，實爲馬氏就任親職後美國對歐政策之初次重要宣布，其路綫與前任國務卿貝爾納斯對波宣言完全一致。美對反對理由，係以波蘭政府於選舉時壓迫民主份子爲根據，據稱，「波蘭臨時政府壓迫手段，並不以所謂「地下份子」爲限，實係大規模威脅恫嚇民主份子。此輩民主份子雖不屬於政府黨集團，但實忠於波蘭」。美政府因之認爲雅爾達及波茨坦協定，對於波蘭自由選舉之保證未能履行。美國與波蘭政府樹立外交關係，實因有此兩種協定之故。</p>

<h3>緬甸要求多未償願</h3>
<p>緬兩代表見解</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕緬甸行政委會委員鳥騷，爲不贊同緬甸領袖與英政府所成協定之二員之一據吿路透社訪員，謂緬甸代表團所向英政府提出之要求，泰半未充分償願。烏氏曰，吾人來此，乃爲與英政府討論緬甸自由問題，吾人抵後，即一致以代表團全體之名義，提出要求若干條，此項要求乃依緬甸人民之志願而決定，各代表均無異見，其中包括（一）許緬甸於一年內觸立，（二）以直接選舉成立制憲議會，（三）建設臨時政府，內閣具有全權，（四）國防外交權均移交緬甸閣員，（五）財政自主。此外尙有次要之要求數項，除用一九三五年之機關直接選舉以成制憲議會外，其他要求，皆未經英政府充分允許，一年內獨立問題，完全打銷，制憲議會所決定之一切，且須由英國會贊同，國防外交目前在立法上全不能有所作爲，至於所將許予緬甸之自由，等於許予印度者，余覺緬甸人民所欲得諸會議者，已成泡影，此余所以不願署名於協定也。另一不贊同協定者爲緬甸運輸交通委員賽恩，據稱：協定所規定之一切，與原提之要求相差頗遠，大失緬甸人民之企望，故不願署名協定，制憲議會乃諸項要求之最重要者，然制憲議會對於認爲適合緬甸之憲法，無最後決定之權，操此權者爲英國國會，此焉得稱爲獨立。</p>

<h3>遠東法庭指陳　各被吿均有罪　東條辯訴不值一笑</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿九日電〕遠東國際法庭被吿辯護人今日綜合列舉以下各點，爲各罪犯辯護：（一）此次戰爭在日本爲肪衛自己之戰，並不違反巴黎和平會議，凡爾賽條約等國際條約。檢察官所提證據，令人感覺所有被吿均有罪，同時又令人感覺皆無罪；（二）關於破壞和平之罪，檢察官未能提出證據，證明日本之軍事行動，係被吿側人或共同謀議所計畫準備者；（三）關於殺人之罪，已證明被吿中無一人曾命令日軍殺人；（四）關於通常之犯罪及違反人道之罪，檢察官未能證明被吿單獨或共同與違反法規之日軍各個行動有直接關係。對俘虜及收容者之人道上之責任，係現地軍司令官之責任。</p>
<p>十大罪狀</p>
<p>檢察官對以上各點，加以駁斥，力主各彼吿均在個人上及全體上負有犯罪責任如下：（一）所有證據及證言，明示各被告之共同目的，在於統治「大東亞」地域，包括侵略戰爭在內；（二）一九二八年至四五年間，日本軍閥中顯然有人與民間人共同謀議，大川周明之「大東亞秩序建設」，明白表示該事實。共同謀議終於實行三月事件，十月事件，瀋陽事件，被吿大川，橋本·坂垣·土肥原，均參與其事；（三）關於瀋陽事件，當時之南陸相及其後繼者荒木等均曾準備侵略「滿洲」，樹立僞政權；（四）被吿等曾强化與德國締盟，侵略中國；（五）七七事變後侵略中國之狀況，係企圖將中國軍隊加以殲滅，殺戳，歸順，當時首相平沼肯定此一方針，又根據星野所提政策，為日本利用中國及全東亞之資源，又在南京北平樹立僞政權，違反九國公約等；（六）日本之政策，不獨在建設「東亞新秩序」，且謀將英美人逐出中國，松井·橋本·松岡·小磯等，曾謂驅逐所有英美人，乃其最後目的；（七）關於日德關係，締結軍事同盟，防共協定，企圖侵略南方等處，陸海外交三部密切聯絡，規定日德勢力圈，强迫米內內閣辭職，由近衛·松岡·東條·平沼·大島·白鳥等代替；（八）於是以三國軍事同盟謀制覇全世界；（九）有充分證據證明共同謀議曾決定　蘇戰爭，其後雖實行南進，然此事並非放棄攻擊蘇聯；（十）日本爲　　東亞，退出國聯，擴大陸海空備，將委任統治地化為要塞，珍珠港及香港之攻擊，並非共同謀議之最高潮，攻擊英美，僅屬統治全東亞之手段，是即共同謀議　　內外活動之最後目的。</p>

<h3>小羅斯福提十二項問題　史達林的解答</h3>
<p>美國「展望」雜誌發表歐里奧，羅斯福的專文，內有一九四六年十二月廿一日史達林訪問記，其中包括史達林對於小羅斯福所提十二個問題的解答。小羅斯福的問題和史達林的解答全文如下：</p>
<p>問題一：「你相信像美國這樣的一種民主政體，和像蘇聯這樣的一種共產主義的政體，共處在這個世界中，而任何一方沒有企圖對另一方的國內政治事務實行干涉，這是可能的嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：「是的，當然相信。這不但是可能的。這是賢明的，而且是完全在現實的範圍以內。在最奮發緊張的時代，戰爭期間，政體方面的差異，並不曾阻撓我們兩國聯合在一塊，以消滅我們的敵人。在和平時代，繼續這種關係，就更加是可能的了。』</p>
<p>問題二：『你相信聯合國的成就要看蘇英美之間對於基本的政策與目標方面的協議而定嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：『是的，我想是這樣。在許多方面，作爲一種機構的聯合國的命運，都要看這三個强國達成的和諧融洽的情形而定。」</p>
<p>問題三：『大元帥，你相信我們兩國之間，爲了製成品與原料的互換，而達成範圍更加廣大的一種經濟協定，會成走向世界和平的一個重要步驟嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：『是的，我相信這對於確立世界和平是具有重要性的。我當然贊同。世界貿易的擴張，在許多方面都會對於我們兩國之間的良好關係的發展有所裨益。』</p>
<p>問題四：『蘇聯贊成聯合國安全理事會立刻成立一種由所有一切聯合國會員國組成的國際警察，以便凡有武裝戰事使和平受到威脅的任何地方，就立刻開進一去嗎？」</p>
<p>史達林：『當然贊成』。</p>
<p>問題五：『如果你相信原子彈應由聯合國管制，那麽聯合國應不應該經由監督的方式，來管制關於任何性質的軍備的一切研究機關與製造機關，並且管制和平時期原子能的運用與發展呢？』（說到這裏，歐里奧，羅斯福插了一句話說：「史達林反問了一個機敏的問題：「就一般而言嗎？」我說：「是的，不過特別是就俄羅斯在原則上對這一種計劃的協議而言。」』</p>
<p>史達林：『當然相信。根據平等的原則，不應該爲了俄羅斯而作出例外來。俄羅斯理應運守與任何其他國家必須遵守的同樣的監督與管制的規則。』（小羅斯福在這兒又插了一句說：『他的回答毫不含糊，而且關於保留否決權的問題連提都沒有提起。』）</p>
<p>問題六：『你想，如果舉行叧一次三强曾議，以討論目前使世界和平感受威脅的一切國際問題，這對於一種有益的目標會有貢獻嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：『我想，應該不是有一次會議，而是要有幾次會議。如果有好幾次會議，就會對於一種有益的目標有所貢獻了』。（在這裏，小羅斯福插了一節：『說到這裹，我的妻問他是否以爲道樣的會議對於各該政府的官員之間在較低的水準上達成較爲親密的關係，是否會有幫助。她又問戰時的會議是否已達成過這樣的結果。他向她微笑着回答說：「那是沒有問題的。戰時的會議以及已達成的結果，對於在較低的水準上實行合作曾大有幫助。」」）</p>
<p>問題七：『先生，我知道您是對於其他各國中所存在着的許多其他政治問題與社會問題研究有素的一位學者。所以我就要問：您是不覺得十一月間美國的選舉，指示出人民方面巳對於故羅斯福的政策的信仰發生動搖，而傾向故羅斯福的政治敵手們的孤立派政策了嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：『我不怎麽熟悉美國人民的國內生活，不過，我想那决選舉是指示出美國現政府在浪費故總統所創造的道義上與政治上的資本，因而使共和黨人輕而易舉的博得了勝利。』（在這裏，小羅斯福插了一句說：『大元帥回答我的下一問題時，十分加重語氣了。』）</p>
<p>問題八：『自從羅斯福逝世以來，我們兩國之間友好關係與了解的减少，您認爲應歸罪於什麼呢？』</p>
<p>史達林：『我覺得，這個問題如果是指美俄兩國人民之間的關係與了解而言，就並沒有發生什麽惡化情形，正相反，關係已經增進了。至於兩國政府之間的關係，是有過誤解，發生過某種惡化情形，後來更發出許多叫囂，說這種關係還要更加惡化下去呢。但是，就破壞和平或軍事衝突的意味說，我並看不出關於這一方而有什麽可怕的地方。沒有一個大國在目前能够驅使大軍去對別一個同盟强國，對叧一個大國去打仗，即使它的政府很想要這麼幹的話，也是決不能够的，因為在目前一個國家如沒有人民參加就不可能打仗—而人民都不願意打仗。他們都對戰爭厭倦了。而且，也沒有大家可以理解的目標來替新戰爭辯解。人們將不知道爲什麽要打仗，因此，關於美國政府的一些代表們正談論我們之間的關係惡化一節，我看不出有什地可怕的地方。鑒於所有這些考慮，我認爲新戰爭的危險是不實在的。』</p>
<p>問題九：『您贊成我們兩國之間廣泛交換文化的與科學的知識嗎？而且你也贊成交換學生，藝術家，科學家，和敎授嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：『常然贊成。』</p>
<p>問題十：『美蘇應該制定一種共同的長期的對遠東各民族人民實行援助的政策嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：『我覺得，這如果是可能的話，這將是有用的。無論如何，我們的政府是準備在遠東問題方面奉行一種與美國共同的政策。』</p>
<p>問題十一：『如果美蘇之間商定一種借款與信用放款的制度，這類的協定會對美國經濟永久有利嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：『這類信用放款的一種制度，當然對美蘇兩國雙方都互相有利。』（在這裏，小羅福揷了一句說：『於是我問了顯然是與歐洲許多國家有關的一個問題。』）</p>
<p>問題十二：『德境美英佔領區沒有貫澈肅淸納綷的工作，這一點便使蘇聯政府有重大理由表示驚愕了嗎？』</p>
<p>史達林：『不，這並不是表示重大驚愕的理由，不過，我們共同鋼領的這一部份沒有予以貫澈，蘇聯當然是不快意的。』（培斯社莫斯科專電）</p>
<h3>國際糧委會</h3>
<p>決定我上半年所獲米額</p>
<p>〔中央社曼谷廿八日電〕暹羅米糧聯合委員會我代表蕭松琴種，國際糧食救濟委員會最近一次分配於我國作爲今年上半年之用之米，總計廿四萬噸，其中由暹羅緬甸各負責交出十萬噸，餘數由越南及他區負担。中國今年最初三個月自暹羅所獲得之米，計一月二月將獲一萬一千五百十一噸，三月一萬三千三百八十九噸，暹羅因陳米之貯藏吿竭，故最初輸出量不多，以上之估計係根據新米之收成及工廠之出產，暹政府人士雖因秋季豐收對將來之糧食輸出量表示樂觀，惟此間運輸專家則深表懷疑，蓋刻下暹境之交通效率，較戰前低落甚多。</p>

<h3>吉田内閣欲倒不倒　社會黨不接受吉田條件　組織聯合内閣仍多困難</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿九日電〕日本自由，進步，社會三黨領袖吉田，幣原及片山今晨舉行會談，商組聯合內閣事宜，吉田表示爲克服民族危機，願行總辭職，組織聯合內閣，勉渡重大難關。片山表示從國家立塲，夙已充分考慮協力組成聯合內閣，然必須由在野三黨參加協商，石橋財政必須改變，社會黨入閣者須任由社會黨自行決定。吉田請社會黨接受四個閣席，希望由各黨公平立塲組織聯今內閣，然協民黨入閣一事，法律上有困難，關於石橋財政問題，願充分考慮。結果今日之會談，意見米獲一致，片山將召開社會黨中央執行委員會，決定最後態度，至自由黨方而今日午後舉行在京議員會，決定絕對反對　換石橋藏相，故吉田內閣今日能否實行總辭，刻尙未定，惟吉田本人似已決心促成此舉，內　書記官長林讓治今晨訪衆議院正副議長，商談聯合政權成立時，向日皇奏薦內閣首揆之手續問題。</p>

<h3>五人調查委會　實地勘察火區　根據災户證言　扣押兩救火員　目睹趁火搶刼童子言之鑿鑿　潘議長表示對證人須加保護</h3>

<p>調查人員首先訪問武定路四四二號順康南貨海味號，該號適位起火處之對面。據店主裘炳順吿稱：起火的時間是年初一夜九點半，火主是武定路四二五號一個銅匠家中。據最早發覺起火的煤球司務阿錢談，係電綫走火所致。裘炳順在五分鐘內，曾往隔壁打電話向消防處報吿。第一輛救火車在廿分鐘後到達。這時，廿九號王雲甫宅的木棚已經延燒了，這木棚是王宅十六個傭人的住所，離開起火點較近。但是爲時僅十餘分鐘，即吿撲滅，所以當後來的八九輛救火車陸續開到時，實際上火勢已吿熄滅。然而半小時以後，廿九號的三樓突又起火。這時美軍的救火車也到了，但是他們因爲接不到水龍，無法助救，看他們的情形，似乎還有過一番爭執。可是當美軍看到那些救火員把水冲在王宅玻璃窗上，又在玻璃上滑下來時，曾經開槍把玻璃擊破，讓水從窟窿中衝進去，將火舌灌澆。半小時中，灌澆雖然沒有停止，可是大部因爲澆在鉛皮屋頂上，無法壓制火勢。當天的風並不大，所以廿九號足足延燒了三小時，然後才延到廿七號。據傳說：廿九號三層樓上有箱子百餘隻，都是細軟皮貨，有人曾看見救火員在三樓窗口出現，但是他們却不許住的人進去。</p>
<p>老虎灶呷酒談天　曾留下酒瓶一只</p>
<p>裘炳順並且指出救火員們漫不經心，曾在附近老虎灶内呷酒談天。於是調查委員會把那個住在武定路四四八號的聚興園老闆任煥亭叫來。那個任老闆說：在年初二早晟四點鐘光景，有消防員數人跑入討開水吃，並　帶洋酒一瓶，熊度悠閑自得，並且命令速生爐子，燒熱水取暖。委員問任老闆有否　以菜餚？他憤然地答：「房子着了火不救，誰還高興給他們吃！」那些救火員於呷酒之後，曾留下空瓶一隻，現在保存在葛主任委員那兒。那不是黃酒或是什麼菉豆燒之類的酒瓶，而是陳年的名喚（薄荷酒）Peppermint的洋酒。瓶塞掉在酒瓶裏，想是吃的時候貪圖便利。我們知道祗有富人家裏，才有這種陳年的洋酒的。但到目前爲止，酒的主人還未找到。</p>
<p>二十餘億的猪鬃　連洋房都被燒去</p>
<p>接着，委員們到火塲去查勘。出乎意外的，廿九號雖然最先被延燒，但不論從裏到外，都比別家來得完整些。灶間沒有壞，樓梯沒有坍，牆上綠漆猶存，窗口上簇新的聖誕老人一個亦仍在。有一根救火皮帶自後門通人，被燒斷壓在瓦礫堆中。值得注意的是每幢洋房之間確有風火牆。張處長說：「有風火牆，消防處的責任就更大」。</p>
<p>據說：起火的時候，廿九號屋主三友實業社經理王雲甫全家都在美琪戲院看電影，女傭人看見火，衹急得發慌，她們固然曾向救火員求救，可是她們都是傭人，什麽都作不得主，結果放在花園裏的價値廿餘億的四百箱猪鬃，連那幢富麗的洋房都被燒了。</p>
<p>衣橱鞋箱　劈一大洞</p>
<p>十一號是慶豐紡織股份有限公司襄理唐瑞千家，也就是道已燒成斷坦殘壁的業王。在他家瓦礫堆裏，看見香糟田螺一罇，想是過年時吃剩的，他家的老媽子王英娟說；火燒到我們房子時是深夜一點鐘。但是從十點鐘起，進進出出的救火員已經陸續不斷了，他們不許我們搬東西，但是却把樓下房間中的衣橱和鞋箱劈了一個大洞。奶媽要到樓上去搶東西，却被救火員抱住了調戲。</p>
<p>隊長跑來打電話　屬員談笑索茶烟</p>
<p>當巡視完畢，大家回去午膳，預備下午尋訪災主的當兒，記者又訪問了一家近鄰，據他們說：自夜間起火以後，到他們那兒借打電話的救火員始終川流不息，這些電話大槪是打到救火會裏去的，如：「爲什麼我們靜安區來了，新閘區還不來」？「救火車沒有汽油，快拿些汽油來」。「時間過了，爲什麽還不來調班，嫌我們好欺嗎」？此外，他們還看見一個隊長跑來打電話時，對那些安坐在屋中的屬員說：你們爲啥不去救火？但是救火員依然談笑自若，索烟索茶的，那裏像是在救火？</p>
<h3>唐祝名家字畫　全部化為灰燼</h3>
<p>下午三時，許多受害人被保長召集在他的家裏和調查委員見面。爆炸的憤怒，使他們不再像羔羊似的軟弱。他們壯直地伸訴，無私地揭發。</p>
<p>首先發言的是十一號的顧澤之，他的房屋在西摩路小學貼鄰，當銅匠家起火時，曾把東西搬出，後來因爲火熄了，所以重又搬回。等到火勢再度旺盛時，屋內烟霧騰騰，臭氣直冒，巳經無法再進去，只得眼睜睜地看着它燒。他曾向一個救火員求援，但是正在施救的皮帶管子却滿是破洞，水花四射，除了全身被皮管子裂縫中的水澆濕外，一無效用。於是，眼看着他的珍貴的祖傳唐伯虎，祝枝三等字畫，全部化爲灰燼。接着，搖頭太息不止。</p>

<h3>靜看市校大火　笑說市長有錢</h3>
<p>顧氏特別指出，當時救火員的荒唐舉動。當他發現國民小學校燃燒時，他曾鼓勵救火員說：「這是市立小學，趕快去救」！不料救火員竟冷笑着說：「反正市長有錢」！接着，自然來一個按兵不動的具體答覆。最後，顧氏再加一句，說是這句話是親耳聽見的，可以負一切的責任。此外，希望市府協助二點：（一）此次火災貽誤的責任，及搶刦勒索的事實，是應該澈底查明的。（二）大房東於今日登報，通知二房客須於十日內出淸火塲，由業主搭籬笆整頓，原承租人之租約宣吿無效。這種趁火打刦的舉動，當局應予阻止，維護受害人有承租新屋的權利。</p>
<p>救火員自己打架　三四人扭作一團</p>
<p>四二五號，起火地點的受害人說：起火時，我正在戈登路打牌，突然間，電燈熄滅了。當時只以爲是燈壞了，想買蠟燭來繼續作樂。誰知竟是自己家裏起火了，等到奔回家時，內人正拖着孩子逃出來。我們放下孩子進去搶棉被時，立刻被烟火所堵住，無法退出。慌忙間祇得用刀將隔壁王家的籬笆割斷，從他們的後花園中逃出來。可憐孩子連衣服都米不及穿，淋在大雨中直發抖。他又說：午夜一時左右，在大康里門口他親眼看見救火員自已打架，三個人扭做一團，後來經過另外幾個救火員的勸解方始罷休。當時在塲者均憤怒異常，消防員隔岸觀火雖屬可恨，火前打架更屬可惡！</p>
<p>入門先問啥地方　知是學校掉頭去</p>
<p>西摩路國民小學校長潘文珍女士情緒更激昂，她滔滔不絕的說：我發覺時，廿九號剛起火，救火員即絡續地跑進屋來，我吿訴他們，趕快拆屋澆水，但置之不理，祇問：「你們這兒是什麽地方」？吿訴他們是學校，立刻掉頭而去。以後直到燒光爲止，就始終沒有看見過一條水龍進來。學校裏的教員潘天民和詹春年曾親自跑到廿九號去看施救情形，但看見水龍始終沒有朝上，問：三層樓大火，爲什麼不朝上澆永？回答很乾脆：沒有水，你懂什麼？這樣到十一點鐘時，學校已受延燒。一直到第一天四時左右，學校尙在火燄中。前門的房間早已燒完，僅有後門的圖書館還未燒到，敎員等苦苦哀求消防員趕緊加以施救，但無結果，說是沒有「苗」（龍頭）。</p>
<p>最後自己來動手　才得保全圖書館</p>
<p>這樣一直和他們糾纏了二小時餘，眼見火快要燒到岡書館，只得自己動手，把拋在地下不用的水龍拉起向圖書館猛澆，結果終得保全。潘校長說：一共化不了多少時候火就熄了。所以學校裏的人都相信：假使他們自已有工具，火是燒不到學校的！最後，潘校長下結論說：消防員未向我索金條，道聽途說的也就不去讀它，但是他們不救火却是事實，態度悠閑，慢條斯理的，彷彿人家火燒，與他們無關似的！</p>
<h3>橡膠廠主　否認賄賂</h3>
<p>永勤橡膠廠的老闆童克勤竭力否認他曾有賄賂的舉動，他說：「這是可以對天起誓的！起火時，他不在廠裏，得到消息已經是十二點鐘了，趕緊奔回去，大衣都來不及穿，身邊連車錢也未帶。到廠時，王家早已起火，橡膠廠亦遭殃及，看見廠中有皮帶，但未裝龍頭，所以沒有用處，那時曾經看見有個消防員，便求他去拿龍頭，但一去未返。廠裹的火，是自己弟兄和三個小工救滅的。廠中備有滅火機十幾具，都已用完，再用鉛筒澆水，火始吿熄滅。童說：我也曾經聽見過救火員要敲詐槓的傳言，所以看見自己廠中的火滅了，就趕緊溜之大吉，免得被他們碰見了自找麻煩，這時約為淸晨四五點鐘。</p>
<h3>參會警政委會　全力協助調查</h3>

<h3>二檢察官再度勘察　傳訊保甲長等證人　灌救不力確係實情　勒索並無具體證據　王雲甫家一女傭陳述　日光燈被救火員携去</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案地檢處沈祖壽檢察官，昨晨偕書記官，攝影員再度赴火塲勘察，並攝取照片，同時當塲傳訊保甲長等證人，調查消防員當時施救詳情。據保長蔡國樑，甲長孫治平·張秉文等聲稱：消防人員灌救不力，確係實情，至於勒索金條，趁火打刧，均係事後傳聞，並無具體證據可以提供。永勤橡膠廠經理童遜德則否認曾向消防員行賄。王雲甫家女傭屠蓮寳稱：確有日光燈一具，被救火負所携去。另據消防處王科長報吿：消防處內並未收到日光燈。沈檢察官認為王家旣已證明有日光燈被携去，而消防處又無收到，則被人趁機刼去，已不難想像得到。在法律立塲言，刧取日光燈與刧取珍貴財物，其所負刑事責任相同。又首席檢察官黃亮特於昨晨十時左右趕往火塲親自察訪，對在塲偵查之沈檢察官有所指示。</p>

<h3>出席國際勞工大會　我代表返國抵滬　各職工會歡迎者八千餘人</h3>
<p>劉松山談大會議案要點</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國參加第二十九屆國際勞工代表大會之勞方代表劉松山，顧問周學湘，當大會閉幕後，於去年十二月十八日由法啓程返國，昨日下午一時，所乘之法輪齊柏林號抵滬。本市總工會及造船橡膠捲烟郵務等職工會約八千餘人，赴虹口招商局碼頭歡迎。二氏下船後，鞭砲聲振耳欲聾，當由工會女代表二人上前獻花，二氏旋乘車赴蓬萊路總工會休息。據悉：市總工會常務理事會，定於今日十二時假福來飯店爲二氏洗塵；全滬工界定下月一日下午二時在康樂酒家舉行歡迎大會，請二氏報告出席國際勞工會之經過。劉氏日內除向上海國際勞工分局報到外，並定下月初晋京，向社會部報吿。</p>
<p>據劉氏吿記者稱：此次國際勞工代表大會，自去年九月十九日起，會期三週，在加拿大商業中心蒙特利爾城舉行，參加者共爲四十六國，出席代表四百餘人。我國代表團十三人，李平衡，吳秀峯二氏代表政府，張劍慧代表資方，劉氏代表勞方。劉氏繼述此次大會召開之意義及其議案要點，由於世界三十餘年間經兩次大戰，因經濟混亂影響政治不安，大會即針對此點，力謀主持正義與人道，以求世界經濟之平衡發展。其議案要點：（一）修改國際勞工憲章，（二）根據並檢討舊的制定新公約，（三）制定保護靑年工與少年工（按即我國所稱之童工）之辦法，（四）制定政策，提高殖民地工人之待遇。劉氏補述第四點稱，我國雖無殖民地，但我在各國僑工之生活亟應提高，故亦贊同此蒙。</p>
<p>劉氏於參加國際勞工會後，並與周學湘氏於去年十一月十日分別代表我國建築，防織兩業勞工會，出席在比利時舉行國際建築，紡織勞工代表大會。劉氏最後發表感想稱：今日世界已入原子彈時代，我國各方面俱感不够標準。勞資雙方應加緊努力，資方應本人道主義，注意勞方福利，勞方則應自我犧牲，自我管制，一本國家利益，自可協調向前，一切應擦糾紛，皆屬不智之舉。</p>
<h3>軍事性罪犯赦免辦法　警備司令部正請示中</h3>

<h3>吳淞口撞船案　雙方均有錯誤　兩船長疏忽職務　地檢處提起公訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕芷江輪華通輪互撞失事案，芷江輪船長忻成方，華通輪船長張晋聲，事後即由地檢處扣押，並由方正檢察官積極進行偵查，茲偵查業已終結，即經提起公訴。檢察官認爲被吿圻成方，張晋聲，非唯負責全船事務，且均係航行駕駛人員，對於業務上應盡之事項，自應特別注意，方足以盡職責。而今竟漫不經意，疏忽其應盡之職責，致使碰撞傾覆，乘客慘遭溺死，影嚮航行安全，雙方旣屬各有錯誤，自應同負罪責，均有觸犯刑法第一百八十三條第三項：「從事業務之人，因業務上之過失，傾覆或破壞現有人所在之火車，電車或其他供水，陸，空公衆運輸之舟，車，航空機者，處無期徒刑或五年以上有期徒刑」。刑法第二百七十六條第二項：「從事業務之人，因業務上之過失致人於死者，處五年以下有期徒刑或拘役，得併科三千元以下罰金」。刑法第二百八十四條第二項：「因業務之過失傷害人者，處一年以下有期徒刑，拘役或一千元以下罰金；致重傷者，處三年以下有期徒刑，拘役或二千元以下罰金」之罪嫌。並應按同法第五十五條：「從一重處斷」。</p>
<p>方檢察官之起訴書中稱：「芷江輪傾覆沉沒之際，乘客蔡志林一名，當時逃命軋傷身死，其餘獲救乘客中七名受傷」。又稱：「查該兩輪駛抵吳淞口內石埂附近之處，據航政局對於當時航行海圖研究結果，該段航行道寬度至少在八百呎以上，華通輪左邊號道應有三四百呎，證明被吿　威方，不遵避埂章程第二十五條向右航行，反向左避讓，所取航綫題有錯誤，被吿張晋聲駕駛華　輪所　鐵駁船兩艘與其本輪並駕齊驅，亦有違港務長佈吿第十五號規定。雙方航行錯誤，發生　　，乃為明　之原因」。</p>

<h3>翻箱又倒籠　滿滿入口袋　災戶代表一席話　不知人間是何世</h3>
<p>廿七號房客周秀珍的代表周企舫，替調查委員會帶來了最大的帮助。周企舫看上去還是個不滿二十歲的男孩子，但是其機警和鎭靜，超過尋常的成人。他親眼看見救火員翻箱倒龍，把口袋裝得滿滿的。並且把他們的號碼也記淸了。他極有條理的說：廿七號共住有七家人，進出人雜，所以發現銅匠作起火時，即以後門關上，進出均走前門。不多時，聽說火已滅。大家都很安心，不料，隔不多久，火又重燒，這時曾有救火員來打後門，爲借電筒，並且喊：人都出去，把窗子打開，房門打開，不多久，他們的三層樓被延燒了。</p>
<p>周企舫離開火塲是在午夜一時半，重回探望是第二天早晨。據說：火到初二日中午十一時尙未熄滅。周企舫有一個親戚厲聲均，在中央消防隊任分隊長，翌晨曾爬到屋頂去探看，吿訴他，火災後情形還好，箱子保存者很多。臨走時，並吿訴周企舫說：這回接班的隊長叫李訓，火滅後可設法把箱子搶救出來。厲氏離去後，周企舫雖好幾次想爬入火堆中，都被阻止。這時候，有四個救火員站在二樓窗口翻東西，最後，他借了梯子，偸偸地爬了上去，當他們發現時，他答已與分隊長李訓接頭。這時，消防員便逼着他把箱子打開，箱中有毛巾半打，手帕四打，及棉毛衫等，均塞入袋中。說：毛巾好，手帕好，給我們用！除企航淸楚地記得，其中二個消防員的號碼是〇一一和〇一七，此外一個看不情楚，還有一個戴平頂帽，服裝與普通的不同，好像是隊長。</p>
<h3>南海漂浮一晝夜　歷險歸來談經過　「呂宋小姐」號獲救一搭客抵滬</h3>
<p>菲律賓遠東航空公司巨型客機一呂宋小姐」號十一日由滬飛港，在菲律賓海面失火沉沒，其中幸而生還，且在菲負責辦理善後交涉之搭客管聖甫，已搭法郵齊柏林號輪來涎，於昨日中午十二時抵達。據其暢述經過稱：所乘之四引擎巨型機，十一日七時半自上海起飛赴港。至十二時卅分，發覺香港氣候不佳，改飛廣州及廈門，均同　惡劣，最後決定飛馬尼刺。至一時三刻，發覺引擎之一起火冒烟，當即將火撲滅，惟引擎發怪響，且振盪不已。斯時有一美人用難懂之英語囑乘客「各歸原位，穿上救生衣，並妥繫帶子一。一剎之間，巨機已俯衝下水。時太平門幸已打開，而權旁已浮現自機中取出橡皮小艇五只。乘客三十人，（其中英人六，華人廿四）除四人死於機中三人出機後因無力攀住小艇而下沉。餘者即攀登艇上。維時水急浪高，機身沉重，飛機墜水三分鐘後即下沉。出水乘客分搭五橡皮小艇，隨水漂流，至晚天黑浪高，衆皆以爲絕望。挨至明晨六時，遙望十五里外有一小島，奮力前駛一小時，仍朱能有寸進，結果祗得任令漂流。至十時半，始被飛機五架發現，覓船來救。十一時五十分始登美輸考林司將軍號。在此廿二小時，小艇波動，衆皆嘔吐，最感痛苦者，厥爲缺少飲水。又管氏檢討飛機失事，發表感想三點：（一）菲律賓航空公司應負責任，蓋此次出發飛機，因引擎不靈，換去其一，而實施工作之工程師，多係無資格者。且此壞引擎仍置機艙，徒增重量。（二）在外國飛機中，無中文譯員，而我國乘客中很少知英語者，致有未將救生衣穿上或綁妥帶子者，落水時皆慘遭撞斃機中。（三）英人至馬尼刺後，彼國使館妥加照料，而吾國駐外當局，翌日始派員慰問。管氏稱，現除死者無法佔計外，每人損失行李，當在三四千美金，已延亞歷山大律師，代表全體遇險乘客，與公司當局交涉中。</p>

<p>〔中央社漢口廿九日電〕中國航空公司息：二十八日一四五號滬渝班機失事後，此間今晨六時派專機一架，前往搜尋，發現該機焚毁於天門縣屬永隆河附近，因無機塲，不能降落。下午復派專機前往巡視。該公司武昌辦事處長黄一葦定明晨率醫師護士携帶醫藥，乘汽車前往急救。又另據鄂省府廿九日接天門縣府電稱；該機係在縣境漁新河附近墮落，常即起火，經當地鎭長率隊撲熄。內有二十六人，除一外籍人士重傷已送縣城醫治外，餘均罹難。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司C四七型一四五號滬渝班機，二十八日自滬飛渝，在離漢口約三十分鐘航程處又吿失蹤，公司方面得訊後，昨日派機凌空搜尋，已於上午九時十五分，發現該機墜毁於距漢口百公里左右鄂西之天門縣境，全部機師乘客等二十六人，是否均已罹難，截至昨晚尙未能確悉，中航公司漢口辦事處已組織吉普隊趕往出事地點辦理善後。</p>

<h3>躺臥籐椅上公庭　江上達扶病受審　出任偽職稱曾報中統局備案　辯論終結諭定下月五日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江上達爲漢奸嫌疑案昨晨在高院扶病應訊。江躺於籐椅上，下墊棉被，因患肺病甚劇，是以面容憔悴。頭髮花白，黄　鬚，戴灰色羅宋帽，全部拉下，僅露眼鼻，內穿藍綢面絲棉袍，外罩藍綢面黑紫羔皮袍，紥脚褲，黑色鴨舌呢鞋，圍淡黄色羊毛圍巾，身覆淡藍花格羊毛毯。旁置痰罐，熱水瓶，後有家屬一人照料。不時咳嗽，吐痰，吃藥片，喝水，躺着答辯，聲音極其微弱，有時僅點頭示意。</p>
<p>江係武進人，五十五歲，素有名於紡織界。三十一年三月經敵派充蘇浙皖紡織業同業公會副理事長，同年復任僞棉業統制委員會委員，三十二年任僞商統會理事，三十三年敞欲敲錠獻鐵，由江出而折衝，與敵中日貿易聯合會簽訂協定，由敵中日貿易聯合會供給原料。託由該會配給同業製成棉布，　價賣於敵中日貿易聯合會，　　止獻鐵之交換條件。</p>
<p>江上達以微弱之音調答辯稱：出任僞蘇浙皖紡織業同業公會副理事長，係同業之推舉。僞商統會理事係敵人强行指派。這裏面情形很複雜。對於敵人收買紗布政策我一向是反對的，曾經將市面紗廠化整爲寧，遷至鄕間，使敵人收買紗布政策不能貫澈，因此日方懷恨，將我拘入都城飯店，達三個月之久。日人提出敲錠獻鐵計劃，同業爲生存計，聯合反對，終將敵人此項計劃打消，保全紗錠二百餘萬錠。至云代敵中日貿易聯合會織製紗布，作爲交換條件，與事實不符。簽訂合同。我未參加簽字。我之出任僞職，係事先密報中央黨部調查統計局備案，並經該局派我任上海工商組情報員，有案可稽等語。</p>
<p>由證人國信紗廠經理韓志成證稱：在敵僞時期，江上達對國人設立紗廠極其愛護，曾密囑各紗廠化整爲零，遷至鄕間，以破壞敵人收買紗布及敲錠獻鐵計劃。繼由被吿律師周英才，李謨起立辯護。</p>
<p>至此，劉庭長諭：本案辯論終結，定二月五日上午宣判。江上達仍押送劍橋醫院繼續療養，惟不准自行出院。遂由醫院工友兩人將籐椅抬上汽車，疾馳而去。</p>
<h3>孫田昌植資敵案　軍事法庭昨偵訊</h3>

<h3>德孚拜耳兩廠　積極籌備國營</h3>
<p>將以易貨方式向德採購原料</p>
<p>德僑產業淸理處之淸理工作，至去年度年底止，已將近完成，關於將來德孚拜耳兩廠，原料如何供應我國市塲問題，頗引起一般人士關懷。茲悉：該處現正積極籌組以上兩廠爲國營股份有限公司，並將天津，靑島兩處敵產維新化工廠原有機器原料，均劃歸德孚收購。靑島方面之廠價讓總値七十億元，業於上週成交。夭津方面在洽商中。同昨由中信局以易貨方式向德採購製造原料，以利生產，並以兩公司賸餘財產作爲一部份股東，一俟顏料，藥材供應程度恢復常態時，再以所有股票按照市價出售，其資本定額多少，一時雖未確定，然上項組織原則都於最近獲得行政院批准，而明令中信局代表政府從事經營。</p>
<h3>偽財廳長張德欽　病死於監獄醫院</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕已判有期徒刑十年之僞浙江省財政廳長張德欽，於昨日下午三時五十分病死上海監獄醫院內。其病症爲糖尿病及肺膿瘍。張逆病危時，曾由監獄當局通知渠之家屬入內探視。屍體昨晚仍暫厝於上海監獄內。</p>
<p>按張逆係江蘇寳山人，現年五十六歲，曾就學美國林肯傑弗遜大學，得法理學博士學位。敵僞時期曾歷任僞社會福利部專員，僞邊疆委員會委員，僞浙江省財政廳長，僞中央信託局保險部經理。張逆於審訊期間即息重病，去年六月二十二日審理時，係經人背魚上庭受審。去年六月二十九日經高院判處有期徒刑十年。</p>
<h3>鄧脫路敵產被侵案　江海關函復地檢處</h3>

<h3>龍華機塲跑道　運集沙石　準備修築</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自民航機迭次失事以來，各界對民航設備嘖有煩言。交通部為改善龍華機塲，曾撥款九十億元，成立「龍華機塲修建工程處」，委派陳祖東任處長，石裕澤任副處長，負責修理該機塲　之南北跑道。</p>
<p>龍華機塲本有跑道四條，目前因經費關係，僅能先修建最常用之南北跑道，因本市風向多爲南風及北風，而飛機係逆風降落者。</p>
<p>根據原來擬定之計劃，南北跑道於三月底可完工，目前因材料運輸可緩慢，恐順俟四月中旬始可完工。</p>
<p>修建龍華機塲南北跑道，目前尙在準備階段，現正不斷運輸石子，黄沙及水泥。因利用木船採運，需時較久。各項修築工具，如軋石機，刮路機，滾壓機，洋灰拌合機等，多係向公路總局眞如機械築路總隊租借，尙有一部份係向「行總」申請購買。唯各項器械皆極笨重，運輸殊感困難。</p>
<p>全部修建工程，由中聯，陶桂記，及葆華三家營造廠承包。</p>
<p>龍華機塲南北跑道修建計劃，長度爲六千英尺，寬爲一百五十英尺。左右兩側，增舖路肩二十五英尺，並有水溝設備。跑道中間舖直伸縮節，每隔一百二十英尺，舖橫伸縮節。跑道上層，舖設十一吋二分厚之水泥。該項跑道修築完成以後，可供四十餘噸飛機降落之用。（下圖：機塲上搬運砂石情形）</p>
<h3>針織業女工　鬧年賞怠工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市針織業電機組女工，共約有二三千人，去年年底，曾要求發給年賞每人五十萬，資方以去年營業情况不佳，且向無前例，經呈請社會局調解，裁定依法辦理，不予發給。廢曆年旣過，一部份工廠於日前開工，乃工人即實行怠工。社會局以工人此次怠工，工會方面事前並未知悉，恐有人從中操縱，乃於昨日下午召產業工會負責人到局，諄　多多　起責任。據悉，資方　允年賞以每人一打普通　子爲原則，（約二三萬元），勞方未曾答應，其要求約在十萬元以內。</p>
<h3>攤販事件嫌犯　地院正式判免訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕去年攤販事件中，因妨害公共秩序罪據被拘之　　犯方道生等四十六人，前經地檢處偵查終結，提起公訴，移送地院審理，於本月六日開庭，因各被吿所犯罪嫌，均合大赦令甲項赦免規定，已當庭准予交保開釋。昨日地院對該案正式判決，依刑法第二百九十四條第三項，　知免訴。此轟動一時之大案，至此完全結束。</p>
<h3>參會公用委員會　商攤地節電兩事</h3>

<h3>工商危機更趨嚴重　高利貸等若不解決　勢將發生解僱問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局勞工處長趙班斧昨對記者談稱，如高利貸，外貨傾銷，及交通等問題仍無法解決，經濟危機將更趨嚴重，本年度本市工商界恐將有嚴重之解僱問題發生。解僱雖屬合法，但失業人數加多，社會治安必將蒙受重大影響。是以對此問題深爲焦慮。本年工商界旣逢此危機，資方固應開明，勞方亦應用極大忍耐以渡過此難關。同時政府應多辦失業保險，工人敎育等福利工作。</p>
<p>趙處長繼檢討勞工處過去一年之工作，自稱僅及治標，作消極性之「救火」工作。頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚。原擬舉辦之失業保險等事，因日日忙於調解勞資糾紛，遂無暇顧及。對此向覺慚愧。惟自問一本良心做事，且工人皆視我爲朋友，而不以官吏看待，此點甚可吿慰於己。</p>
<p>對吳局之辭職，趙處長稱：對之百分之百同情。宛如久戰沙塲者，應調回後方休息。吳局長一年來事務忙碌，最近腦神經發痛，延及頸部，即回頭亦感痛楚。此次乃提出辭呈，以便休息。其辭意似甚堅決云。</p>

<h3>社會服務　讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）棄舊迎新</p>
<p>陸桂良問某甲與乙結婚後年餘，復與丙女實行姘居。迄今四載，生有子女各一，現甲視乙如眼中釘，今有法律疑問數點，祈予以答覆。（一）甲與丙已生子女各一，親族皆知，如此在法律上是否犯重婚罪？（二）雖無書面證據，而以戶口表爲憑，在法律上能否作爲證據？（三）乙若與甲離異，在法律上可否要求賠償損失費？（四）乙所生之女若歸乙領養，可否向甲要求敎育生活等費？（五）乙與甲憑親族或至友立據離異，在法律上能否生效？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）甲與丙如未舉行正式結婚禮，僅係同居關係，則非重婚。（二）已如第一款解答。（三）可請求賠償損害。（四）子女依法應由甲領養，但另有約定者從其約定。（五）兩願離婚應以書面爲之並應有二人以上證人之簽名。</p>
<p>（二）脅迫成親</p>
<p>王正卿問　某甲在十六歲時，由母作主憑媒妁之言與乙女訂婚，某甲對於該項婚的絕不同意，抗戰軍興，國軍西遷，鄕間治安頗爲混亂，乙女之家屬要求甲方領回，以免發生意外，甲母在不得已之下，祗得將女領回，作爲童養媳，民廿七年某甲在滬習業，家中情况不朋，但聞謠傳乙女在鄕間，不守婦道，但無實據，且聞乙女曾生性病。翌年某甲遵母令與乙女結婚，然其內心痛苦，非筆墨所能形容，現某甲另有女友，雙方已訂婚的，故某甲欲與乙女離婚，茲有疑問數點，請予指示爲感。（一）甲乙結合全非本人意旨，完全出於强迫，在法律上是否有效？（二）乙女曾患性病，（未婚時所患）某甲可否藉此訴請離婚？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）婚約應由男女當事人自行訂定，但父母代訂之婚約須得本人同意，否則無效，又婚的不得請求强迫履行，此爲民法第九百七十二條及第九百七十五條所明定。（二）曾患不名譽之病症者可據爲離婚理由，但非法律上規定構成離婚之條件。</p>

<h3>央行續有壓力　烚赤趨勢仍穩</h3>
<p>烚赤昨人心稍穩，惟央行仍有壓力，晨開三九〇萬至三九二萬，開後先見微降至三八九萬，然因一般心理對存金量及墨停售黄金，咸具疑慮，人心尙穩，央行以三九〇萬之價，明配一六八〇條後，曾哄高至三九六萬，央行逢高有拋，曾回降至三九〇萬五，而後復定，午刻在三九三萬左右徘徊，午後隔日交割央行再拋數百條，市價遂無甚變化，結果較前收微挺，飾金掛四十一萬，銀元平定，暗拆銀根微鬆，晴息在一角半至一角八間。</p>
<p>外幣依然靜止若定，美鈔暗市仍在六千七至六千九間徘徊，惟近午時賣買價已吿軋攏，午後更爲呆滯，市價在六千八至六千九間盤旋，結果較前收微穩，港票亦然，始終在一三五〇元左右掙扎，港匯微升至一三二〇元左右，成交不多，印匯一六〇〇元，英匯二一〇〇〇元，兩者有行無市。</p>
<p>公債昨仍感呆滯，成交不過百餘萬，六六〇室有納，六〇四室微售，統丙晨開一九八〇元，高價二〇五〇元，最後在二〇二〇元至二〇四〇元間徘徊，結果較前收計甲乙丙平平，丁戊各漲一百元。</p>

<p>棉紗—昨日棉紗市况，客帮吸胃較健，本街染廠以春節已逝，趁低價時收吸，做開四十二支藍鳳由四百五十二萬步漲至四百五十八萬，二十支及十六支粗紗亦上升自二萬至五萬元云。</p>
<p>棉花—昨日現棉市况，申新紗廠進大中集細絨五十餘担，又民營小型廠交易白洛去花二百包，惟因現貨枯燥，業中人俱抱向榮心思。</p>
<p>棉布—昨日棉布市氣，因紡建公司開售細布甚多，致十二磅彩球陽鶴每疋下降五百元至一千元，五福細布現籌碼不充，獨好一千元，其餘均見平定。</p>
<h3>警局令具成交單　人絲暫停市</h3>
<p>人造絲業同業公會昨接市警察局通知，略以人造絲每筆交易須寫就成交單，並須塡明購進及賣出人之戶名，地址，用途，及成交價格，據人造絲號業同業云：人絲自中信局統籌統配後，人絲商號均無生意可做，蓋所有人絲商號，中信局早經規定停配，敵僞時間之存貨，亦已日漸買完，欲苟延殘喘者，使能在廠家掉花色中稍圖薄利，現在市警局諭令塡立成立單，其中用途一項，無法照塡，且人造絲交易近來極爲稀少，每日成交不過數箱，在此情形之下，暫時停止交易，今日人造絲無市。</p>

<p>外股昨熱股尙乏特變，各方興趣忽移中於墾植，該股自二千八喊高至三千五，餘者均見平和，結果較前收計會德豐·業廣·怡啤·紙業均平，鋼業漲半成，航業微升，而怡紗·英聯微降。</p>

<h3>動力缺乏　影響生產</h3>
<p>據紡織業方面人士稱，現在上海各廠幾無不受電力之影饗而被迫停工。最近則不特每星期內要停工兩天，每日且停電幾小時。查上海電力公司，共計十一萬啓羅，供給紗錠不過三百餘萬枚而已，但滬上除兩百萬紗錠之外，尙有織布及其他工業尙多，其需要之數不下十五啓羅。故現有之動力，在最短期間，是否可以够用，殊成問題，抑上海各種敵僞工廠以及新設工廠，迄未開工者，何止數百家。故上海電力之不足，當爲注定之命運，而吾國一部份紡織工廠在此時此地若不自設發電機，則停工之損失，殊爲可觀。</p>
<h3>人絲廠經交易均淸</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市因配貨有限，人心又振，但市塲中成交須簽立單據，藉以防止配貨流入市塲，致昨市欲漲而止，且無成交，昨市喊價一二〇號東洋有光三百五十萬元，高山及旭字喊價三百四十萬元，比上日稍堅。</p>
<p>廠經因鋇錢業往來放款尙未通融，銀根不易週轉，交易淸淡，昨市喊價比上日略疲，D字等級喊價五百三十萬元，千經討價四百萬元，不過並無成交，綢貨亦因銀根關係，吸胃甚淡，昨市價與上日均無出入。</p>
<h3>本市存煤數量充裕　下月配煤維持常態　燃管會主委徐樂天發表談話</h3>
<p>經濟部燃料管理委員會配售之煤觔，盛傳將於下月起實行調整價格，記者昨特趨訪該會主任委員徐樂天氏，據稱關於此項調整配煤價格，確已決定，其主要原因，係以顧念各鑛商之成本，調整後當可稍减虧耗，至目前本市存煤數量頗充，現各地煤觔到貨，因秦皇島冰凍未解，稍受影饗，台灣方面則絡續有貨運到，下月份配煤數量，可維持正常狀態，與本月並無變更，徐氏並鄭重表示，所有家用煤球原料之煤屑，該會正竭力設法採運，曾向安南訂購一批，以交通關係，目前尙未能如期運到。</p>

<h3>本市私校校長昨開會　自行決定學費標準　吳市長懇切致詞尊重參會決議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立中小學校長聯誼會，爲討論此次市參議會所決定之私校收費標準問題，特於昨日下午假育才中學，召開第四次大會。出席施駕東，須文祥，項恩元，兪傳鼎等四百三十餘人，代表六百餘單位。吳市長，及市敎育局顧局長，李副局長，朱處長，謝處長等，亦列席參加。</p>
<p>市長致詞</p>
<p>蔣紀周，高爾柏，沈同一為主席團。主席高爾析報吿開會宗旨後，吳市長即致詞稱：個人認爲敎育是國家根本事業，假如敎育辦不好，中國沒有希望。古人有言：「天地君親師」，本人一向將師道看得很重。去年五月到上海接任市長，不待九月間市參議會開會前，即自動將敎育經費自百分之九提高至百分之二十，此次參議會決定學費標準，私立中小學校長在報上刊登啓事，本人看後，很覺難過。日前私校敎職負請願時，本人已說過有兩種矛盾心理，要將敎育辦好，敎職員生活必需安定，但同時因物價關係，家長負担亦應顧到。且私立學校敎職員之待遇，更受公立學校之牽制。吾人對師道要尊重，敎育要提倡，但同時民主政治要顧到，上海爲國際都市，要做到民主化，想提倡民主，一定要尊重民意機構—參議會—之決議。假如鬧成僵局，不是敎職員沒有出路，便是民主事業在上海失敗。本人相信本市百分之九十九的私校校長是好的，百分之九十九的私校敎職員是好的，因爲自己有信心，相信中國有前途，智識階級有前途，假如我做市長的天天爲別人所罵，祗要自問心安，自己對得住自己，亦就不管。智識階級不能感情用事，要顧全大局。現本人有三項建議：（一）尊重中國民主事業，（二）敎職員生活，求得安定，（三）借此機會，整頓本市各私校，使百分之百都好。此三項建議之實施辦法，則爲（一）爲使民主事業可得保障，各學校應暫遵照市參議會所定標準收費。（二）編造戰前戰後學校開支敎職員比較等統計，彙送敎育局，市府根據事實，提交即將復會之市參議會，請求複議，此爲合理之路，（二）去除百分之一的害羣之馬，表示私校完全是爲社會及人民服務，由校長及敎職員組織委員會，所有學校經濟一律公開。如照以上三辦法實施，僵局可打開。家長可諒解，社會可同情，民主事業可得保障，各位生活亦能商得安定辦法，希各位採納！</p>
<p>局長致詞</p>
<p>繼由顧局長致詞稱：敎育局自覺慚愧，此次擬送參會討論之收費標準，雖經本人說明，但會塲一般情緒，對敎育工作不能諒解。社會一般心理總指說敎育界不好之處，俗語云：「隱惡揚善」，但至今隱善揚惡。當時敎育局所擬標準，各中小學校長已說祗能勉强維持，但經參議會討論，得此結果。如今不是增加幾萬元之事，而是對私校不諒解，不同情。乃使各位在心理上不舒服。有甚多家長，爲願子女受好敎育，而不計較數萬元錢。且去年本人曾與市銀行接洽商定，可貸款予學生家長，但很少有家長去申請。現今雖有少數參議員對私校不同情，但對外不負責任，彼等指摘之點，希各位有則改之，無則加勉。且當討論時，贊成增加學費者爲五十一票，反對增加者爲五十票，故各位在道義上可滿足，因有多數人同情。關於中學免費名額，參議會議決百分之二十五，關於此一問題，有方法可解決，即由學校每一董事負擔幾個名額，以募化方式解決之。現市府沒有力量，吾則可設法補助，回看上海工商業，那一種在向上，可說祗有敎育事業在蒸蒸日上，故還可樂觀。相信敎育事業，在不久的將來，一定能得社會的同情，與各方的援助。</p>
<p>校長意見</p>
<p>與會各校長熱烈發言，聲稱：因工商界不景氣，家長負擔固應顧到，但回憶上學期開學時，敎師因待遇低，叧有高就，紛紛離職，校長請不到敎師，此苦痛至今猶能想像，各私立學校之環境各各不同，要顧全事實，合法合理，故不能作硬性之規定。</p>
<p>決議事項</p>
<p>（一）最後經商討決定，為爭取由校長自己決定學費之主權，當經表決：三十六年第二學期私校收費標準如下：小學部學費十二萬元，雜費四萬元，共計十六萬元；初中部學費十七萬元，雜費八萬元，共計二十五萬元；高中部學費二十二萬元，雜費八萬元，共三十萬元，並將此項決議，呈市府備查。本學期，將依此標準收費，上述學費數，皆係最高額，各校不一定依此最高額收取。（二）免費學額，市參會定免費額百分之二十，半費額百分之十，共計百分之二十五全免，經決議小學改爲百分之二十，中學改爲百分之十五，餘額由敎局加以補助。（三）經濟公開問題，議決下列實施辦法：（甲）各校現用會計方法，參差不一，而學校則有大小之分，對查核經濟，甚難以一種格式統一辦理，經議決：聘請會計師二名，以學校之大小定甲乙二種賬册，供給私校會計之用。（乙）查核各校經濟，是否用之合理，經議決：通知各該稽核委員會切實負責。（丙）各校經濟於學期結束時，向校董會報吿，再由該會所出之定期刊物上，加以披露。（四）後討論三十五年度第一學期教育局所定五億元私校補助費一案，經市參會通過，至今尙未撥下，決請市政府撥充本學期淸寒學生貸金之用。（五）對敎育貸金委員會所募得之六千餘萬元，已撥充各校敎員者約四千萬元，尙餘二千餘萬元，由貸金委會主任委員陳汝惠主張存於大成銀號，現該銀號於去年十二月間宣吿倒閉，要求市政當局追究責任問題。</p>

<p>火車穿過大鹹湖（本報特派員毛樹淸寄）</p>
<h3>橫斷北美大陸　五畫夜萬里行（一）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>深入落磯山</p>
<p>加里福尼亞十三日航訊</p>
<p>新年以後的第二天，電訊報的記者摩理期，要叵兩岸去休假，的我同行。倉促中，我離開了紐約。</p>
<p>從紐約到舊金山，三千二百餘英里，等於從上海到新疆，在火車沒有修築以前，前一輩的美國人，憑着他們的熱忱與勇氣，拖着一具笨重的木輪車，纂路藍縷的開發了這被人認爲神秘的美洲大陸。</p>
<p>坐潘斯滿格列車代替了便宜飛機</p>
<p>橫貫美洲大陸的鐵路，是南北戰爭以後才興築的，到現在還不到八十年。</p>
<p>最快的火車，要走三夜四天，因此，民用航空事業發展以後，許多大腹賈的商人，或者軍政顯要，乃至於手頭不太窘澀的「小康」人士，都改坐了飛機，飛機票價美金一百一十八元，叧外再加交通稅在內，還比全程的「臥車票」便宜。飛機飛行的時間，不到二十個鐘點。</p>
<p>但是，一遇到冬天，許多人仍然願意乘坐火車，前個月，一架從紐約出發的飛機，在將到舊金山以前的兩小時，忽然在納伐達州掉了下來。和上海的墮機事件一件，全部旅客都罹難，唯獨一個三歲的小孩子，却安然悻存。</p>
<p>因此，我也決定走火車的一路</p>
<p>我坐「潘司滿格」列車到芝加哥，在芝加哥躭了一天。芝加哥積雪盈尺，比紐約州的「銀色世界」，更爲可觀，一位朋友一輛自備汽車，陷在雪地裏，雇了七名黑人苦力，才將它推出來。晚上，走在密歇根湖上，血液都彷彿不能循環轉動。芝加哥約有經騐的美國人，把冬季作爲他們整伏冬眠的季節。他們圍着火爐期待着夏天；「夏天是屬於我們的！不是嗎；轉眼就是春天，春天一過，不就是夏天了嗎」？</p>
<p>半年前，我來過這裏，那是芝加哥的黄金季節。常年湖上蕩漾的靑年男女，常年碧茵芳草的成千人羣，如今都不知那裏去了！冷落，寂寞和荒凉，冬天是芝加哥的末日！</p>
<p>我在朔風凜冽中奔到西北車站，晚上十點鐘開的「艦冷其」列車，直開舊金山，九點鐘前後，驛台外的鐵門邊，已經擠得人山人海，大部份是聖誕休假滿期的GI　，他們趕回舊金山營房裏去，內中有一小部份，要搭船開拔到日本和中國。</p>
<p>車站上洋溢着一片無秩序的喧鬧聲，不規則的軍歌，配合着大聲吼叫和咆哮。當火車開動的前十分鐘，那稱爭先恐後的擁擠，在最「自由」的中國和法國，也是看不到的一位老太太擠壞了臂骨，翻在地上呻吟，小姑娘把行李箱擠掉了「拉手」，土頭土腦的「鄕曲」，擠得眼淚水倒咽，但是，那些英勇的「壯士」們，依然大聲的狂叫和歡笑。</p>
<p>我想起一個月以前，某位議員在國會說的話：「長期的募兵制度，會削弱了美國軍人的素質，更會减低美國國民道德的水準」！</p>
<p>我吿訴他;我在瑞士躭過一個星期，他非常高興的比擬給我聽:在納伐達，猶泰，科羅拉多這幾州，有很多山窪裏邊的小城市，靑山，綠水，冬天有滑雪，有溜冰，完全跟瑞士的洛桑，洛迦諾，伯爾尼，日內瓦：一樣』。</p>
<p>實際上，落磯山並不如理想那樣峯巒起伏，希臘籍的老頭子吿訴我：『落磯山根本不能和阿爾卑斯山或喜馬拉雅山相比。』美國本身，平原多於山地，雖然領土面積和中國相仿，但是，依我的略的估計，美國的可耕地，要比中國多一倍以上，在依阿華，在奈布拉斯加，許多非常肥沃的黑土地帶，還任令荒蕪着。</p>
<p>一路來，懷瓦明算是最貧脊的一州，那是一望無際的半沙漠草原，許多牛羊羣，在那兒尋找草地，一位陸軍軍官說：懷瓦明很像阿利桑那，阿利桑那是乾旱沙漠區，懷瓦明是半沙漠地帶。他說：很久以前，懷瓦明有一個地方，某家農夫拌了香烟頭在地上，頓時，荒野間便燃燒起來，一簇獨立着的野火，燒得滿天通紅，一直燒了三十五年。</p>
<p>這不是神話，後來地質學家發現了那兒有油礦。</p>
<p>「落磯山帝國」時髦的二三事</p>
<p>從懷瓦明進入猶泰州，便踏入了落磯山的區域，當地居民們，有一個特別名字，他們自稱爲『落磯山帝國」（Rocky　Mountain　Empire）。我在火車上買了一份科羅拉多州的報紙，裏面有大幅『本報啓事』，大意說：本報爲使落磯山帝國中之讀者，明瞭一九四七年度美國婦女服裝的改變起見，特派女記者克寗斯小姐，常川駐在紐約，每週通訊報導紐約時裝。</p>
<p>可惜的是：我沒有在車上碰見一位落磯山帝國來的『臣民』，我無法了解：他們現在的服裝，和紐約芝加哥有什麽異樣。</p>
<p>落磯山從加拿大到墨西哥，南北綿延，奧格登附近有一段缺口，鐵路爲建築方使起見，都利用這座缺口舖軌。如果說：這段缺口等於中國甘肅省的『河西走廊』，那末，奧格登城，便等於美國的嘉峪關。奧格登火車站有一點像由國式的建築，屋頂上舖的是中國式的黑瓦片，車站上有幾個大字：『通達美國大西部的門戶』。</p>
<h3>西岸紀程　鐵路分屬四公司</h3>
<p>『艦冷其』列車上，我整整坐了四晝夜，橫貫了北美大陸的四分之三，走過肥沃的農業區伊列諾安，依阿華和奈布拉斯加三州，也走過半沙漠的乾旱草原懷渥明州，更穿過了美國的屋脊落磯山，以及落磯山坐落的猶泰和納伐達兩州，最後才到達西海岸的『黄金故鄉』加利福尼亞。</p>
<p>如果將細約比作中國的上海，芝加哥應該是中國的武漢，由武漢造一條鐵路到新疆的塔城，也必須經過豫陜的農業地點，經過甘肅西北的草原，最後進入『中國的加利福尼亞』-新疆省。（註：美國時代雜誌，好幾次稱新疆爲中國的加利福尼亞）。</p>
<p>美國全國的鐵路，都是民營的，（祗有一條例外）。橫貫北美大陸的幹綫，所有權分屬於四家公司，從紐約到芝加哥的一段，屬於紐約中央鐵路公司；芝加哥到渥麥哈城，（在依阿華和奈布拉斯加兩州交界的地方）屬於『西北鐵道公司』；渥麥哈到猶泰州的奧格登，是幾家太平洋鐵道公司聯合經營的，他們特地成立了一個機構，叫做『聯合太平洋鐵道公司』；從奧格登到舊金山，則是純粹屬於南太平洋鐵道公司的。</p>
<h3>大西部的門戶　奧格登城</h3>
<p>火車在奧格登站上停留好幾個鐘頭，我環遊了奧格登全城，街道，建築，都和洛桑一模一樣。城外，遠遠望得見層峯摺疊著的落磯山，和山峯頂上終年不融的白雪。</p>
<p>城內都是些出賣紀念品的小舖子，專爲過路旅客置備的。日本人很多，他們賣些小玩具之類，我在一家日本店子裏聊了很大，老闆名字叫中村，他兒子個子長得很高，在旁邊插嘴說：『不要跟我們談日本，好不好？因爲我們現在都是美國公民了』！</p>
<p>他們說：奧格登的遊客很多，因爲從洛杉磯，西雅圖，舊金山來的旅客，都要經過奧格登，然後到芝加哥，波士頓，或紐約。</p>
<h3>列車橫跨大鹹湖　時間達五十五分鐘</h3>
<p>在奧格登西面有美麗的大鹹湖，在奧格登西南，有繁華的鹹湖縣，鹹湖縣是由一位名叫摩孟斯　Mormons的美國人，在一百年前的今天（一八四七年一月）開發的，他戰勝了紅印第安人，樹立了西洋社會的文物制度，如今，鹹湖城已經是一個具有十五萬人口，在『落磯山帝國』之中，數一數二的大都市了。</p>
<p>到舊金山的火車，沒有經過鹹湖城，但是却橫跨了大鹹湖，大鹹湖的兩頭，舖有長堤，鐵軌築在堤上，湖中間，架有很長很長的鐵橋，專門供火車駛用，我計算跨湖的時間，一共走了五十五分鐘，堤和橋的工程，都非常可觀。</p>
<p>大鹹湖出巨量的鹽，生產情形，有如四川的自流井，但就中美兩國地理的相似點而論，大鹹湖猶如中國的靑海。湖水是深藍色的，湖上沒有漿聲帆影的小舟。</p>
<p>環湖，遠遠望見落磯山起伏著的山峯，傍晚五點鐘，一抹夕陽，照射著山光，雪影，水色，給人帶來了一種大自然的美感。</p>
<h3>郭奇蘭教授講鐵道史　東西會合通車告失敗</h3>
<p>出發以前，我聽紐約大學的郭奇蘭敎授，講過一點美國交通，特別是美國鐵道建設的歷史。這位敎授曾經寫過好幾本美國經濟建設的歷史，每本書上，他的結論是：美國之享有今日之經濟繁榮，可以說完全得力於前一輩人的遠大眼光，那就是十九世紀七十年代，八十年代之間的大規模鐵道建設。</p>
<p>據郭奇蘭敎授說：常年有名的鐵道企業家，都有意建築自大西洋海岸橫貫到太平洋海岸的鐵路，但是：第一，財力不够，第二，穿過洛磯山，施工艱難。但是：最後爲什麽終於完成了呢？那完全是政府的帮助。政府發債劵，不惜一切力量，帮助這幾個新興的太平洋的鐵道公司，聯邦政府用無條件的犧牲，獎勵有功於國家的私人企業。</p>
<p>道位敎授還說：『那時候，儀器材料都簡陋，工程師的才能也有限，但是，爲了要早日通車，決定從東西兩頭同時趕上，以便在中間會合通車，但是，天哪，一築到中間，却會合不起來，因爲地圖不準確，而工程師的設計，也過份草率』！</p>
<p>七十年間，這條鐵路翻修了幾次，我無法知道，就我這次沿途的觀察，我覺得仍然萬分簡陋，枕木一律都平舖在地上，沒有像京滬滬杭甬那樣隆起的『土方工程』，隆冬，白雪皚皚，增加了不少行車的困難。</p>
<h3>銀色世界　一片喊冷聲</h3>
<p>三千多英里的北美大陸，盡是一片銀色世界，全美國比較起來，以中西部濱湖幾州爲最冷。餐車上，我說：芝加哥最冷，一位老頭子插嘴說：威斯康辛比芝加哥更冷。叧外一位老太婆搶着說：『威斯康辛算什麽，你知道我們明尼蘇達的雪有多厚』？</p>
<p>一位希臘祖籍的美國老頭子哥斯可列斯，坐在我旁邊，他輕輕吿訴我：『就不和她辯論罷，明尼蘇達冷，有什麼了不起？你到奧格登，看看落磯山的雪色罷！那兕是終年下雪，和瑞士一模！樣』！</p>
<h3>第一米市　蕪湖</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者俞寗頗</p>
<p>十六日蕪湖訊</p>
<p>自南京溯江而上四十多哩－蕪湖，爲鄰近首都的最大商埠，亦爲中國第一米市所、在地。水運交通，佔長江航路要衝；陸運交通，有江甫鐵道，與京滬路連運。抗戰前上海北站每日晨掛客車一輛，直達蕪湖，附近巢湖灌域和青弋江流域，產米極　。廣潮煙寗等處每年所需糧食，多半由此輸供，號稱「蕪湖米」。</p>
<p>米市一瞥　皖南各縣年產米穀，除供當地民食，仍有六百萬石至一千萬石的剩餘，此項剩餘，大部份都由蕪湖出口，賣出的米，換取代價，來供鄉民繳納賦我，調齊國內民食，因此蕪湖的大部份商業及全皖的經濟，都賴蕪湖的米市爲基礎。</p>
<p>蕪湖米市在抗戰期內及收復後的一年來，米銷的冷落和積習相沿的使費陋規，比從前更是變本加厲，成爲一般工商業指摘的爭執焦點。最近復有移米市於和縣裕溪口之議，搖搖欲墮的蕪湖米市，誠然經不起寒風的來襲，允使一般業米商人，弄得徬徨，搖惑，焦慮，羣起來一個呼籲挽救的運動。記者於各方注視這問題和殷望之餘，特將蕪湖米市的過去情狀及現在轉變的趨勢，來作一段透視的：</p>
<p>江南米市，以前常集於鎭江，江蘇歲歉，則移蕪湖；安徽年荒，叉移鎭江，米市的集匯，是視江南歲收的豐歉爲轉移。</p>
<p>安徽爲東南諸省產米最富之區，沿江兩岸，縱橫千餘里，都是膏沃的平原，這平原地區，旣經大江流灌，復有皖河巢湖和水陽江，靑弋江，諸水，網佈其間，於是在皖中與皖南，成了廣大的水田區域，由道區域產生大量的米糧。</p>
<p>（上）落磯山的門戾－奧格登城郊山水（本報特派員毛樹淸）</p>
<p>蕪米品質　採運業所屬廣，潮，煙，寗，四帮，所採的米糧品質，大都以當地人民生活習慣而定，如加分析，的如下三項，（甲）糙米，爲廣潮兩帮所需要，以備採回重碾。（乙）上色白米，爲煙津帮所需要，供作北人稀飯之用，終年絡繹不斷。（丙）碎米，以寗波帮銷胃爲最，俗稱米碎，以廉價故，用作釀酒原料。除上述三種外，還有特高機米，（蕪南關產）二高機，中光，高機，（江北產）高糙，（南陵產）舂熟等數種。</p>
<p>至稻的品種，民二十三年，蕪湖縣政府奉令組織水稻品種核定委員會，聘蕪稻作改良塲塲長張家政，高農學校敎授李酸愚等爲委員，並由全國稻麥改進所特派技正周拾祿到蕪折導，徵集優良稻種，令發產區遵辦，加以改良。</p>
<p>米帮組織　蕪湖依米爲市，農商貿遷有無，百業賴以周轉，營業的龐大，自不可缺少團體的機構，其同業有如下的組織（一）米糧採運業同業公會，此類商人，專以在蕪採購米糧運銷外埠，如廣潮煙寗四帮，均系採集運往廣東，潮州，煙台，寗波，魯浙平津等處，各帮設立的米號共有二十餘家，（二）米行業同業公會，係收買鄉問來米，轉售於採運業，此等米行，共有四十餘家，（三）機器碾米業同業公會，係將鄉間運蕪的糙米，加工碾成熟米，或設堆棧專租於米行米號，共有八九家。（四）礱坊業公會，爲舊式礱坊，專代礱米，收取租金，共有四十家，（五）雜糧業米行公會，營業性質，日常專以販賣米糧，供給本市人民日食的用，故又別稱爲小市。以上屬於商人組織的部份</p>
<p>工人組織部份，又有如下五種：（一）帆運業，此業爲專負運輸的業務，凡米糧由鄉間來蕪，必須利用它們帆船裝載，除所得相當報酬，還可賺得戽餘的米，收益很豐，（二）斛行業，此業專負量米任務，當米船靠岸，行號雙方成交之後，由米行雇用斛行工人，到船量米，便於打包，除正當工　資（斛力）外，還有一「斛空」的津貼，（三）絞包業，專爲裝米入包，再用蔴皮絞口，以便裝運，（四）抗包業，專以抗運打成的未包入棧房，或由棧房運至碼頭，（五）碼頭伕，專運米包至駁船或躉船，以便輸運。</p>
<p>銷路廣泛　蕪米的去路很廣，華北的烟台·天津。靑島·大連，東南的廣州·潮汕·厦門，東部的上海·寗波·和蘇北各地，都是消納蕪米的基本市塲。津烟連靑所消受的蕪米，由烟台帮客商運送，滬寗銷米，由寗帮輸送，汕厦兩處，由潮帮輸送，廣州銷米，由粤帮客商輸送，各地納量，以廣州佔最多數，年的三四百萬石，烟台·天津·靑島·營口·大連·龍口，年銷約百餘萬石，寗波年銷的四五十萬石，上海·通州·南京·各地，多係由皖商直運銷售。</p>
<p>米市交易　蕪湖年銷數百萬石的米糧·在數量上說：不能不算是一筆大宗，這宗米糧，都是由鄕村間升斗積集而來。農村當收穫之後，一都份穀米，歸於地主的倉庫，叧一部份，屬於農民自身，地主所有的，可以將米穀囤積起來，待時而售，農民所有的，迫於農忙時所負的肥料，種子，牛租，工資，等貸款，有不得不脫售一部份米穀或全部，以償還到期的債務。每年在早晚稻收穫後，將不能儲藏的食米，用人力担負，或用獨輪車載運，或用小廬輸送到鎭市或縣城中，售與城鎭中礱坊，糧行，米阪及時在城鎭坊行坐待，看蕪市的漲落，定進胃的縮寬，購進的米，隨時由帆船裝載到蕪湖。</p>
<p>四鄉米船到達蕪湖後，賣米的客人，即駐足於米行，由米行向米號接洽，買賣雙方，俱不須見面做交易，一切手續，槪歸米所與米號負責爲之。賣客膳宿，由行招待，買客膳宿，由號招待，各不取費，俟交易成功，雙方向客人抽取佣金，賣客使費由行經手抽收的，有行佣，回號，正力，貼力，回籌，正工包酒，斛力，香烟酒錢，貼現，開倉，斛酒，等，買客使費由號抽收的，有敎育捐，棧租，蔴皮，叨用，保險，印花，等。</p>
<p>客商在大市購米，可間日付款，在小市購米，必須現款交易，在米號或米行購米，携帶款項，投行悉數交存，由行給收據，担負完全責任，客商購得米後，無論打包與否，祗須原行代爲經手，暫儲各處堆棧，客如需款，行號堆棧，亦可挪款，挪付數額，視堆米數目爲標準。</p>
<p>陋規繁重</p>
<p>陋規繁重　蕪湖米市，積有數十年的悠久歷史，依米爲生活的商人工人，總數不下七八萬人，其一種固定相沿的陋規，是確牢不可破。米穀產自農村，由鄕農手裏運出之後，其一續至爲繁複，使費的巨，超過其他各埠之上。其中分工商兩部，買方商人，有採運，賣方有米行，做米加工業有碾米，　坊，零星商有雜糧行等五業，工人中有帆運，斛行，絞包，抗包，碼頭伕，等五業，此業工人，不但從中取得工資，且有非法行爲的舞弊。如帆船伕取米摻沙水，以增重量，實爲米易發霉的最大病根，再如斛空，絞包，都有取巧花樣，碼頭伕以尖筒漏米，不露破綻，此外如額外散工，地保，流氓，乞丐，無吿孤寡，均有開銷，而一日開銷的數目很巨，在在使米商感到頭痛，引爲詬病，雖迭决呈請官廳取締，實際上仍是無法消除。</p>
<p>新生機運　蕪湖米市，自收復後的一年來，各帮銷路，却反常的像逆轉了磁性的指針，由南而北，從南粤的湖汕廣州，轉移到天津和靑島那方向走去，這是有市以來未有的異象。這種異象，當然是時與局變化有關，因爲遠戍北國的大軍，都是江南食米的健兒，於是軍米源源向北運去，但津市實際的銷塲，都是有限，花好不常開，不久會自凋謝。加之北方米價，如流水的向下瀉，在去年十一月後半期，由蕪運往天津的米，受着米價跌落的影饗，使米商全部鑲羽而歸，行將甦生的蕪米，遭此打擊，頓呈陰雲黯淡的景象。</p>
<p>上月又有巢湖流域－廬和七屬人士，倡移蕪湖米市於和縣裕溪口，這種風聲，雖然是客觀的條件不够，難望成功。若不幸而言中。蕪湖的米市，多少必將予以减色，其所以遭到移市打擊的由來，癥結听在，同樣的是在百年來相沿積習的使費和陋規兩者成爲指摘的目標。</p>
<p>去年春夏之交，工商兩業爲了消除陋規，減輕使費，各方幾關紅了面，相持了半年之久，卒未解決。坐視金九銀十兩個月旺銷時問，輕輕掠過，在這時期，蕪米祗銷津帮三十餘萬包，一時全皖人士計算挽回蕪湖米市都認爲使費陋規兩點積弊不除，蕪湖米市，決無復興的希望。因此米業中人和蕪工商界於上月間來一個减輕使費而廣招徠的運動，由各業米商代表在商會集議，自願减除使費三成，簡化交易手續，急圖挽救這不絕如縷的塲面。</p>
<p>在蕪米遭逢厄運的這兩月來，恰巧農行蕪分行，奉侖在蕪購米，是大量的向產區無限制的採運，又弄到蕪湖米市，外無來源，內受滯困的厄境。允幸這塲會議，結果圓滿，並決定電請商會轉請縣參會，縣政府，六區專員公署，四聯總處，中農總行呼籲。關於改進蕪湖米市部份，如米糧行佣的减但，將原收行佣金，自即日起，减除三成，通吿施行。免得各方有所藉口。按現在成規，以四萬元一石米價計算，行佣六分，核計二千四百元，减去三分，合七百廿七元，較前减去三分之二以上。其他使費陋親，當然也是在革除之例，最低限度，也有漸漸解除的可能。這樣一來，米商深感歷來重負的桎梏，心理上驟覺輕舒，因爲商人貿易，首在减輕成本，移市他處，直接遝售，都是冀求成本的减低，今原有市塲，爲衆所憎惡的積習，能够消除，米商亦何嘗不樂於此而就彼？是今後蕪湖米市的趨勢，眞到了「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一邨」，「物極必反一，或者是蕪湖米市一剝極而復」的新生生機歟？</p>
<h3>桂林殘年　略記　臭米粉</h3>
<p>— 本報駐桂記者梁小中</p>
<p>桂林十二月卅晶航訊</p>
<p>有人提議：以臭米强迫救濟分，署同仁嚐試一個月，說起來怕不免有點「感情作用」，正是：「臭米只應難民喫，分署那得一回嚐！」</p>
<p>從淪陷到光復的廣西，兩年來的變遷，完全像一個可怕的惡夢，從大流亡到大飢饉，再從大飢饉到大榨取，直是體無完膚，室無完瓦，雖然今日的桂林市而也在進一步地走向繁榮的恢復，宏偉的十字街廣塲，兩年前爲民衆誓死力爭開不了，而今不費吹灰之力完成，一牌一列的新建築重又與世見面，省府也在皇城內鳩工庀材，恢復舊址……，一切都顯得那末匆忙，有降候不禁憧憬「冬天渦了春天還會遠嗎」的幻念、然而永遠沉淪在嚴冬下面的人人事事，又有幾個走去發掘？不錯，廣西的建設是進步的，我們無需錦上添花，也正如退步的現象無須掩飾一樣，年來冷靜的觀察，總覺得廣西的民氣够進取，肯苦幹，同時另一方面，又會意識到廣西人時常在準備　某一種對落伍政治的反抗力量，驟然看去，彷彿多少有點抽象，其實就事論事，也算得上一决頗爲具體的觀察，爲政不在多言，觀政亦不在多言，人民太需要春天了！</p>
<p>街頭傳單沉靜的氛圍裏，時而總有一兩陣小風波引起人們的興趣，從而窺看官塲內景，往往可得一豹。譬如半月前，街頭巷尾都貼滿了一張傳單，指責新任某局長夤緣買官的事實，而且其中還牽涉到一個爲民喉舌的省參會議長，某局長花了一千萬，某某人得了多少錢，如數家珍的而且鑿，令人不能不信，更令人不能不嘆！而我個人所以佩服廣西的政治民主，其原因也就在這裏……。</p>
<p>撈回本錢最近省府發表了一大批縣稅征收處主任的名單，共有四十多個，其中有一個對記者如是說：「不希望找甚麼錢，撈返本便算了。」絃外之音，一時聽得糊塗，幾疑自己失聰，但是仔細一回味之後，倒又恍然如有所悟。做事是一會事，「做人」又是一會事，魚與熊掌不可兼得之時，誰不捨魚而取熊掌？是故做事做人，倒也「嘸啥」，能够出本錢，便能够本上生利，如此而已！</p>
<p>新鮮把戲最喜歡玩新鮮而又愚蠢的把戲的，許多人都會異口同聲地公推「非救濟分署莫屬」，糊塗到極，也拆爛汚到極！這裏的責圖，沒有私毫個人的成見於中，而是廣西人士一致作如是觀。事實是事實，天花亂墜的工作報吿，只要拿出事實來，便要站不住脚。</p>
<p>最近轟動桂林的一件「碎米案」，又是救濟分署的好戲一齣·分署於本月二日以五十噸「曰米」運桂，以三十噸撥交市工賑委會實施「工賑」，老百姓聞而色喜。差一點正要歌之舞之的時候，不料打開米袋一看，不知道是救濟分署怕難民吃成顆的米不消化呢？還是誤把白米當麵粉？卅噸淸一色的都是旣臭而霉的『米粉！」再查一查其他二十噸，也是一塌糊塗，怎樣煮，怎樣下肚？工賑會看得納悶，索性原璧奉趙，敬謝不敏。救濟分署儲運站一看苗頭不對，不知道是心中有事，（據一般估計，如以好米作一次「貍貓換太子」，五十噸可獲凈利二千萬元。）還是心中有數？不要便索性運走，準備拿到別的地方賣掉再談。</p>
<p>嚴查究竟這麽一來，便激動了公憤，馬上由工脤會請警局派警看住儲運站的貨倉，誰知儲運站有時候又是「智者料事於未萌」，早就把米搬個精光大吉。這麼一來，弄到羣情鼎沸，一致要求嚴查究竟，看看是不是難民應該吃來路不明的臭米粉！全桂林報紙總動員一致攻擊，務期查個水落石出，各機關更會同派員前往倉庫查騐，結果帶回臭米一包，按下「已經霉爛，碎如糟糠，不堪食用」十二個字的公案。高等法院亦派員檢察，準備提出糾舉，各有關機關首長謁見黄主席，黄主席表示關注……一連串的大砲，嚇慌了救濟分署。於是連天「澈查！澈查！」查呀查的，說不定又是「事出有因，查無實據」，輕描淡寫，不了了之。有人提議以臭米强迫分署同仁嚐一個月，說起來怕不免有點「感情作用」，正是：「臭米只應難民吃，分署那得一回嘗」！</p>
<p>減免借額人民對救濟工作的看法只是認爲「一慕沒趣的鬧劇」，譬如說散發冬令救濟品，有人領到一隻手襪，有人領到一塊破布，你呌他們怎麼不又可惱又可笑！</p>
<p>話轉回頭，能够給與人民一塲喜悅，不是四不像的救濟，而是中樞减免桂省征借額五十萬担的消息，這是無數决的請求中一次最幸福的收穫。此外，聽說待到各縣將受災實情詳報後，尙可酌量减免賦額及征購額，消息傳來，人人展眉一笑，齊聲「阿彌陀佛」，賢明的中樞看到廣西人民內心的苦處，廣西人破涕爲喜啦！</p>
<h3>施蒂文大使在廣州</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州特派中　梁風</p>
<p>數月來，粤港間不幸的接二連三發生了那末多不愉快的事件，使廣州民衆壓抑不住悲憤激昂的情緒，這種惡劣的空氣，使中英友誼前途受到莫大的障碍。英大使施諦文爵士這次到廣州來，雖然是以職責關係，拜訪粤省當局，並視察英僑，但這一來對此間這種惡劣空氣，亦足以緩和一下吧。</p>
<p>南來招待記者答復五項問題</p>
<p>英大使這次南來，速日除了官式的拜訪此間軍政當局，和到中山，嶺南兩大學演講之外，也曾招待過一决記者。在招，待會席上，大使曾答覆記者所提出的一些問題；（一）對香港最近發生王水祥張添祥兩案的意見，（二）中英商約進行情形，（三）對目前中國商業情形的觀感，（四）緬甸華僑入境困難問題，（五）英國會吾參加國共調解。</p>
<p>在這些問題當中，這裏一般人士目光集中注意的，當然是王水祥張添祥兩案的問題，但在大使的眼中，却並不如我們看得那末嚴重。他說，這不過是小事情，在人口二百萬以上的香港，這類事情發生是難免的。現王案英政府對死者的親屬，已有相當的賠償，張案亦已由港政府徵詢廣州當局意見，而尙未得到答覆。他強調英國法律精神是要相當的證據，才能判犯人以罪，所以爲了週詳，便花多了時日，這是不能迅速解決的最大原因。他還說：對這些事件，新聞界必須眞實報導，不可故意誇大，這才可以促進港粤間中英友誼。這一點大使也許以爲這裏的新聞界的「故意誇大」，而忽略了這一切是我們一般民衆的意見，而且是新聞界最眞實的報導哩。</p>
<p>根據互惠原則將訂中英商約</p>
<p>自中美商約簽訂後，中英商的自然也値得大家的關懷。英大使說：這商的草案，已於去年六月送達中國政府，到十一月間，外交部又把道草案附加了中國的意見，由大使轉送英國政府研究，相信不久便可簽署。這一商的是根據國際互惠商約而定，大約英國也會和美國可以得到相同的利益，假如英國所提出的條件，而美國商約未列入者，將來美國也可以根據條例請求，反過來，中國自然也可以向美國請求的。大使並表示：中英兩國還可能根據互惠關係，訂立航空條約。</p>
<p>交通幣制政治影響商務發展</p>
<p>對於目前中國商業慘淡情形，大使的看法，是主要在中國的交通困難，幣制不定，同時，中國的政洽問題未能解決，則商業無從發展。不過，大使對中國前途，還是非常樂觀，他認爲中國的政治問題，是一定能够解決的。在這裏，便有人提到英國會吾參加調解國共的問題，大使表示英國並未考慮到，他認爲中國事還是要中國人去解決，假如外國人能帮忙的話，那末，司徒雷登大使便是最適當的人選。</p>
<p>大使並很坦白的承認，英國商業目前亦有若干困難；因爲作戰期間，英國的工業百分之八十改爲戰時工業，現在要回復到平時工業，故須時間二三年，所以目前英國還未能供應中國需要的東西，希望以後能慢慢增加對中國的供應量，英國商務團訪華，已表示英國對中國商業的關切，他們的報吿將可完成，相信對中英雙方都能有一些貢獻。</p>
<p>中印僑民入口仍遭緬甸拒絕</p>
<p>至於緬甸這次拒絕華僑復員回緬問題，大使的回答是，緬甸政府並不是拒絕華僑入口，原因是緬甸淪陷後遭蹂躪至慘，一切還未恢復，故緬政府不願意非緬甸人大量入口，除非可以保證自給自足。因使一萬二千華僑尙滯留廣州，不過此不僅華僑如是，尙有四十萬印度人想進入緬甸，都沒有辦法。大使並說，他曾經和香港聯總代表商洽過，請他們設法遣送了。</p>
<p>最後，大使說到中英文化交琉問題，他說英國文化協會將來會派代表駐廣東，經常與我們文化當局取得聯絡。</p>

<h3>評詹文滸先生新著　「報業經營與管理」</h3>
<p>— 邵德潤</p>
<p>在中國，辦報的事業雖則已是爲人所盡知，但是如何去辦理與開拓這種事業，則很少爲人所了解。大家都在知其然的做，而不肯去知其所以然的研究，所以成功的往往出於偶然，而失敗的則比比皆是，這完全都是不知利用前人經騐之故。對於這些想辦報而不知怎樣才辦很好的人，以及想從事報業而不知如何下手的人，我願意鄭重的介紹他們，讀一讀詹文滸先生所著的「報業經營與管理」。</p>
<p>這是一本切合實際的書，對於有心投身報業的人，這本書給他一個激勵的啓發，對於一個已從事報業的人，這本書給他一個有力的指示。在第一篇「經騐的背景中」，作者引述了許多各報人的故事，給你作再接再厲的鼓舞，史東的誠實政策，納爾遜的認眞精神，以及奧區史與北巖爵士的艱苦奮鬥，都是我們有力的「他山之石」。第二篇「創造自己的事業」中，詹先生誠摯的對有志報業工作的人提供無限珍貴的經騐：（一）必須以創造的特色來迭成「後來居上」的印象，（二）再以誠實的態度服務的精神，來栽培自己的聲譽。對於這兩點，他引述了著名的紐約地球報的奮鬥故事作例，說明了一個肯別出心裁誠懇服務的新生報紙，一定可以打出一條出路，獲得後來居上的地位。</p>
<p>作者堅持一個報紙照常保持一個特色，以作爲它「出人頭地」的武器；同時他也主張報紙應有勇敢的正義感，來指導社會走向對的路上去，他舉出紐約地球報的潔食運動與中美日報的討奸運動爲例。這兩運動在社會中產生莫大的效果了，這兩張報紙也成功了。對於辦報的其他秘訣，作者指出「吸引讀者」與「認識讀者」二點，他認爲報紙爲了爭取更多更新的消息起見，應該不借重資的分派記者到各地工作，他同意陳博生先生多用記者的主張，認爲即使這班人一字不寫，只要他們是在從事採訪的工作，就都是好的。他又認爲報紙的主持人，最要緊的就是了解自己的讀者，重視他們的興趣與利益，他曾引用史東先生的話，認爲「讀者價値超過廣吿戶，讀者的地位高於廣吿戶。」這意見即使在目前的中國報界，也是個珍貴的敎訓。</p>
<p>在本書第三編「組織之道」起，分編叙述「發行原理」。「報紙廣吿」，「排印問題」。與「理財原則」，作者在這幾章中展開了他的論述，提供了許多的意見。對普通的讀者雖屬專門性一點，但你看了全書一致娓娓誘人的文筆，以及那些平實而動八的見解，都會使你一口氣的讀下去。對於從事新聞事業的讀者，那這幾編都是應當逐條琢磨細心硏讀的。例如在發行方面，本書提示了組織報販，加強推廣與吸引讀者的許多具體而有效的辦法；在廣吿方面，本書特別注意分類廣吿，也提示了許多値得仿行的辦法，更重視廣吿人員的訓練，這是我們全國各報業所忽視的問題。對於「排印問題」，本書也有許多技術上問題的檢討，對於中文字架的排列與油墨紙張的管理，都有特別的心得，雖則是一言半語，但你得到這經騐，就可給報館一年省不少的浪費。「理財原則」是最後的一章，也是最難寫的一章。在中國很少人研究這問題的，因爲所有的報紙幾乎都虧本，虧耗了則由發行人東挪西凑的設法彌補，誰也不顧到如何理財兩字。詹先生接到了美國內地報紙協會的材料作一次比較的參考，每爲中國報紙立一個設計的預算，規定一些會計項目，作爲中國辦報者遵循的根據；而其中「怎樣應付緊急局面」一章，允可給我們中國許多在經濟上一無基礎的報紙作極珍貴的參考，總之，這部書値得給一般對新聞事業有興趣的人參考，那些想辦報而不知怎樣才辦得好的人，以及想從事報業而不知從何下手的人，都値得一讀。</p>
<h3>論情緒</h3>
<p>— 納雅</p>
<p>威廉詹姆士著　唐鉞譯</p>
<p>商務印書館三十五年初版</p>
<p>無論是哲學界，社會學界，醫學界的人，凡注意心理學的，都會知道詹姆士的「情緒說」吧</p>
<p>詹姆士事情　說，在心理學史上，是佔着重要的地位的，在他，引起後來者對情緒的更多硏究，使之有更大的增進；而其基本的立脚點，還是在於詹姆士的學說。</p>
<p>「論情緒」，「論思想流」，論習慣」三種，是詹姆士的「心理學原理」中最爲膾炙人口，和有歷史價値的三章。「論思想流」巳在出版界介紹過；現在，我把這「論情緒」介紹諸位讀者。</p>
<p>起首：它證明悲哀，恐懼，憎惡，忿怒，等情緒予以精確之說明。</p>
<p>其次，它由情緒的分類，而找出一個問題－發怒或恐怖的任何現有的「表現」是怎麼發展而來的；這問題一方面關於生理機構，另一方面關於歷史的眞正問題，這一問題，答案很難找，而作者將此問題，作了各種解說。</p>
<p>你者的解說：先在實騐方面核證這個問題的困難，次則對各項駁難加以考慮；這考慮，就各方面的意見，充分解說，也就說明了這問題。</p>
<p>至於「細緻的情緒」和「粗糙的情緒」，也作了不少例與說明，關於：喜樂，親愛，志氣，憤慨，自矜數項、亦以情感的愉快和痛苦感覺來表明。</p>
<p>「沒有專司情緒的腦中樞」。它把各門學識的比較，作出自己的結論。</p>
<p>各個人間的情緒上的不同。有「散播的激盪」，「適應」，「盤桓」，「侍從」種種的不同它也予以說述。</p>
<p>最後，它說出了各種情緒的來歷，較前更詳細地就其本題解說，並提出許多問題，由其答覆。使讀者能獲深切之瞭解。</p>
<p>總之，詹姆士的撰文，並不是「本舖直述」的，他例舉各方而的意見，溶於一爐，然後再作充分精確之闡述。</p>
<p>譯者方面，亦作了許多註解，以帮助讀者易於瞭然，使有困難處，更易明白。</p>
<p>「論情緒」，是每個人修養身心，瞭解心理情緒之發展，所必一讀的書。</p>
<h3>中國氣候圖集</h3>
<p>— 程憶帆</p>
<p>盧溫甫繪製中央氣象局出版</p>
<p>地形和氣候同是人類生存環境裏兩種主要的自然因素。地形圖和氣候圖都是制定一切經建計劃必備的參考資料。沒有這些圖藉做根據，那麼計劃亦必完全空洞而不符實際，無法實施。中國的地形岡自從申報館的中國新地圖，分省新圖和大掛圖出版以後，已經足敷應用。而完整精美的氣候岡却還沒有。過去中央研究院氣象研究所，中國氣象學會和徐家匯天文台的出版物中，雖是零星有一些氣候插圖，然而却是片段的，並且因爲紀錄收集得太少，不符實際的地方狠多，尤其是徐家匯天文台所發表的圖，等溫綫和等雨錢往往不顧地形影響，過山越嶺，不合氣候學原則。其難資依據，毋待贅言，直到最近中央氣象局的中國氣候圖集問世，我們才算有了一本比較可信的氣候圖。</p>
<p>據集首呂炯先生序文裏說，該圖所據紀錄，完全是中央硏究院氣象硏究所及中央氣象局歷年收集所得。因爲各地紀錄年代長短前後的參差，還經過了一番整理和訂正的工作。其搜羅的廣博，繪製的精審，可以想見，不過在氣象紀錄貧乏的中國，尤其是在西部山岳地帶，可疑之處當然還很多，同時因爲印刷稍差，校對疏忽，小的錯誤也頗爲不少。而且每幅圖都沒有一字說明，這都希望在再版的時候能予以改正和增補。</p>
<p>全集共收圖九十六幅－至十三幅爲全年和各月的地面氣壓風向圖。十四－十七幅爲四季氣旋頻率圖。十八幅爲全年雷雨日數圖。這十八幅圖大致可以表示在東亞一帶地面大氣運行和大氣騷動活動的梗概。雖然和實際應用方面關係稍淺，但却是氣候學上重要的基本岡不可缺少。海平等壓綫以二粍爲間隔，風向以矢綫示方向，均稱明晰，可惜風力沒有表示出，量的方面不明。如果能以矢綫長短代表風級，那就更完美了。高空氣流圖一幅都沒有，無由窺見大氣運行的全貌，殊爲憾事。不過道想是高空紀錄缺乏所致，祗有等到將來再設法添補。</p>
<p>圖集的第二部分都是關於溫度方面的。分量很重，相當完備。計有一九－三一幅全年和各月實際溫度岡十三幅。三二－三六幅一四七十月和全年海平溫度圖五幅。三七－四一幅年日較差大陸度和春秋溫差四幅。四一－四二幅絕對溫度圖二幅。四三－四五幅霜期圖三幅。合異二十七幅，洋洋大觀，在繪製上，比起過去所發表的溫度圖精確多了。實際溫度圖和海平溫度圖並列，對氣候學理論研究和實際應用均能顧及，尤為一大特色。霜期圖對農業很重要，値得特別提出來介紹一下。</p>
<p>四六－五八幅全年和各月的十三幅相對濕度圖，五九－七一幅全年和各月的十三幅雲量圖，七二－七七幅的全年和各季的六幅日照圖，以及七八－七九幅的霧霾日數圖，形成了岡集的第三部分，合共三十四幅。濕度雲量和日照圖是硏究農林水利和醫藥衛生的重要參考，而霧霾日數的分佈，則直接和航空及航海有關。不過爲應用計，還應該再加上兩幅霧霾日數年變曲綫圖俾成成全璧。</p>
<p>第四部分包括雨量雨季雨日和變率圖等十六幅八男男－九二幅爲雨量分佈圖，按全年和各月分繪，處處能顧及地形影響，頗具匠心。等雨綫間隔也很適當，間隔均爲二五之倍數，換算英寸，至爲便利。九三幅雨季圖，根據雨量高點和次高點出現月份，分全國爲十三區域，簡明扼要。不過雨日和雨量變率圖，祗名有全年一幅，似乎不够，至少還應該增添分季圖各四幅，因爲在農業上，這兩種氣候因子是極其重要的。</p>
<p>第五部分是九六幅中國氣候區域圖，雖祗一幅，但却是前述的九十五圖的一個總結。區域分劃似乎是依庫奔分類法而再加以細分的。每區都注明了庫奔分類的字母符號，這在學氣候學的人固然可以一望而知各區氣候特色，但是爲了其他方面的人易於了解起見，還需要加上詳細的說明</p>

<h3>讀「貴族之家」</h3>
<p>— 杜若</p>
<p>一八五八年夏日，屠格涅夫游倦西歐歸國，亞歷山大和尼古拉斯制下俄羅斯底農奴生活，赤裸地展在他底面前；脆弱無能的老新黨人底大言不慚，刺激了他；中年失去了的靑春回憶和夕陽斜暉似的心情創疼着他。</p>
<p>於是，經過四個月的辛勤工作，通過了他底優美筆調，產生了「貴族之家」。濃郁底法國浪渙文學的氣息，普式庚底詩的明潔，果戈理底諷刺和豐富；結合了作者自己的抒情和憂鬱，錘鍊成一部灰黯的「傳奇風」底偉大作品。</p>
<p>這部小說側面地描寫了它的主題，那時代底獨特的思潮，狹隘民族主義觀的斯拉夫主義，戰勝了眞理的象徵，偉大博愛的人類主義；這顯然違反了作者的本志，頑固西歐派底屠格涅夫該是極端擁護後者的，但忠於時代思想，他不惜讓前者得勝了。</p>
<p>它的內容大致如下：</p>
<p>拉夫列茨基一個進一步的俄國地主，在父親亡故後，摒擋一切去莫斯科求學？初進大學的二年中，僅結識了一個同學，米哈萊維奇。</p>
<p>某晚，拉失列茨基在戲院中邂逅了一位少女華爾華娜，傾倒於她底美麗，終於通過了米哈萊維奇的介紹，他們熟識了，愛戀了，幷且結婚了。</p>
<p>幸福的新婚夫婦周游了德瑞，來到巴黎。華爾華娜底藝術才能，美顏和交際，使她成了巴黎上流社會的一朶奇葩，被稱做絕艷的俄國美人？拉夫列茨基自己則沈首書堆中，他本計畫着和他底妻同到德國巴頓，巴頓旅行去，然而，一種不測的風　却推翻了他所有底計畫。</p>
<p>一天，華爾華娜不在家，拉夫列茨　無意間在她底私室中，發現她對自己的不忠；一怒出奔到意大利，把自己藏在一個小城裏。從新聞紙上知道她到巴頓·巴頓去了，再後，知道他們己有了個女兒。於是，不名譽的消息接二連三傳來，華爾華娜成了「聞人」。</p>
<p>四年底飄泊生活過去了，他回祖國耕種土地了，一直來到故鄕，整理他底產業。幷拜訪了一門親卷，－他的表姊瑪麗亞，和姑姑瑪爾法，加里丁家底二代寡婦－不想，那兒他又一次地撞入了情網，糾纏而不能自脫了。</p>
<p>他愛上了他底表侄女麗莎維大，一位純潔，虔敬，善良的少女，俄羅斯最完美底女性典型。他底善良和熱情，終於贏得了少女底心。同時，有個俗吏　幸，歪曲的西歐主義者，仗着瑪麗亞底寵愛，也在追求麗莎。他們之間，極不相容，一决，激辯起來，由于那俗吏的自負底口吻，令她反感，他對俄國的藐視允其傷了她底心；拉夫列茨基底爲俄國辯護，更促進了她對他底愛戀。於是，某夜，在加里丁花園中，他們互吻了，最初的吻，也就是最末决的吻。</p>
<p>接着惡運又臨到他底頭上，他那被謠傳已死了的妻華爾華娜，帶着他們的小女兒，突元地來到。市，由瑪麗亞一手提調，演出了一幕「覆水重收」，他被迫承認與她和解，重行同居，饒恕了她，完全爲了他們無辜的孩子。</p>
<p>次日，星期日，早晨，拉夫列茨基跑到敎堂去，瀰撒終了，才找到麗莎。她滿意他底履行了她所提出底，他們共同的義務，－與他底妻和解當然也保證履行，另一部分屬於她自己底，－決不嫁潘幸；同時，認爲幸福操於上帝，所以，決定了「自我犧牲」，向拉夫列茨蓋道出了「永別」。</p>
<p>那年冬天，華爾華娜又背叛了她底丈夫，俘虜了潘幸，遷居到彼得堡。翌年春天，消息傳來，麗莎已掛了面紗，在那個位于俄羅斯最邊遠的一角的B修道院。</p>
<p>八年後的春天，拉夫列茨基又到O市，重訪加里丁家，昔日主人多物故了，代替的是歡樂的靑年們：一去永不復返底，那些幸福的，一刹辰光底追憶，重重地把他擲入悵惘中。後來，他雖也拜訪過麗莎所隱身底修道院，——並且見到了她，但却不能到她的一瞥。</p>
<p>讀完了這故事，可以看出作者以平淡無結果的戀愛爲脈絡，充分表露了過渡時代英雄底感觀：將即要去的時代，給予最後的凝視和傷悼，歡迎那些新上來的靑年，他們才是歷史巨輪的推動者。</p>
<p>拉夫列茨基受了重大的打擊還撃回來耕種土地，他那堅强韌毅底俄羅斯底民族性，不該給我們純然底徒託空言者，一個尖銳的警惕！</p>
<p>麗莎是個虔敬的宗敎信仰者，對宗敎的熱忱，超過了世間底一切，即使人類兩性間最高底靈感的結合－戀愛；退出了幸福圈子，自我的犧牲，正十足地表見出基督的博愛精神。</p>
<p>華爾華娜呢，浪漫主義的尤物，藝術，文學，哲學，音樂全成了她底交際工具，祇能在庸俗的潘幸身上，她才有着無上的，不可抗拒的，對他不負任何實任的威權。</p>
<p>「貴族之家」足稱藝術底結晶而無愧。</p>

<h3>舊鞋</h3>
<p>— 蕭傳文</p>
<p>舊鞋放在屋角裏，已經有半年多了，和　箕掃帶以及沒有淸除的垃圾在一塊，鞋面上的灰　堆得很厚，帶子解開着，不知是否給老鼠咬去了半截，只剩下很短的一段，露在鞋口的邊緣上，除掉那厚厚的還完好如新的橡膠底，尙能引起人們想見它過去曾有過一段光輝的日子以外，給人的印象是破敗沒落，有如一個年老色衰的娼婦，在寂寞悽凉的暮年，不幸地被人們遺棄了，鞋口張開着，更像一張孤苦無吿的口，默默地在嘆息。</p>
<p>顯然地這雙舊而未破的皮鞋，現在已完全失掉了主人的寵愛了。</p>
<p>於是在這些寂寞孤獨的日子裏，舊鞋便只有靠回憶過去以自寬慰。</p>
<p>那是在一個古老的高原的城市裏，因爲地勢崎嶇多山，又被人們稱爲山城，在西南高原各省幾個著名的山城之中，這個城市的確可以叫做典型的山城，三步五步不是一個大坡，就是一個小坡，城裏的房屋和街道，都是順着這高低不平的山勢在坡頭山脚建立起來的，因此住在這個城市裏的人們，必得要有一雙矯健能行的脚，和一種能够吃苦耐勞的精神，那是的確的，原來居住在這山城裏的人們，由於世代居住的緣故，已經有了這種訓練了；從外地來的人們呢，爲了要適應環境的原故，也就都被這種刻苦的精神所感化，不管是從最嬌養的家庭出來的少爺和小姐，或是享慣了福的巨亨們，一到了這個城市，便必得要將自己的脚訓練得能够爬坡登山。許是爲了這點可貴的倔强不拔的精神，正爲我中華子孫抵抗强暴侵略的一種象徵之故，這個城市便成爲中國抗戰的心臟了。</p>
<p>於是由於人們的需要，環境的需要，一種堅牢耐穿，有着抵抗這個山城的崎嶇不平的地勢威脅的皮鞋，便應運而生——這雙舊鞋便是屬於一個有着高貴身份的嬌養的小姐的。</p>
<p>當中國抗戰正在熱烈進行的時候，這個山城正匯合着來自各地的愛國的堅貞的人們，山城的每一個角落，都瀰漫着的確是從這些人們心坎裏發出來的戰鬥熟情，由於人們要從事於積極的抗戰工作，舊鞋和它的同伴們便成爲當日山城人們的寵物，在坡頭和街道上，昂視闊步地活躍了。</p>
<p>那時候舊鞋隨着它的主人自朝至暮，在山城裏到處奔跑，因爲主人也是熱烈的愛國者之一。當晴天的時候，街道和坡頭上的灰塵，像霧一樣滿天飛揚，人們必須掩着鼻孔走路，舊鞋滿身被灰墨蒙蓋着。雨天呢，山城的街道可眞不好走，滿街都是很深的爛泥，人們憑着兩條强健的腿，十分吃力地跑得滿頭大汗，這時候舊鞋和它的同伴們正可大顯身手，靠了它們才可以在那些滑濘汚穢的泥路上爬跑自如。因此舊鞋的樣子雖是笨重醜陋一點，可是由於它的堅牢耐穿，也就爲山城的人們所樂於穿用。</p>
<p>但是，舊鞋的厄運終於來臨了。</p>
<p>自從中國抗戰勝利的消息像霹靂一樣震撼着這個山城以後，人們在一度興奮之後，便紛紛地復員了。不久舊鞋也隨着它的主人，到了中國著名的大都市上海。</p>
<p>當時舊鞋和它的主人，興奮得幾乎流出眼淚來。</p>
<p>可是，曾幾何時，舊鞋便和許多渴望勝利的人們一樣失望了。一到上海，它便失去了主人的歡心，被遺棄了。</p>
<p>代替它的是另外一位寵兒，一雙鮮紅的燦爛的玻璃鞋。</p>
<p>那個新寵兒的確是漂亮的，底子單薄輕快，鞋面閃着奪目的光彩，像戴了兩朶花在脚上，使主人平添上幾分美麗活潑，這是舊鞋自嘆不如的。</p>
<p>但是舊鞋並沒有因此絕望，它還存着一份奢想，也許是一種天眞的想頭，它想玻璃鞋雖然比自己漂亮美觀，但不見得有自己堅牢耐穿，道許就是它的優點，主人一旦發覺這個優點，也許就會回心轉意。因此舊鞋常常以此自慰，耐煩地等着，一天天等着，總希望有一天會重得到它過去的恩寵。</p>
<p>每天早晨當主人穿着那雙簇新漂亮的玻璃鞋出門，或是夜間從外面回來的時候，玻璃鞋總是顯出傲僈的神氣在舊鞋的面前經過，它發出奪目的閃光，又吐出震耳的響聲。</p>
<p>舊鞋對於玻璃鞋這種驕傲的態度，雖然認爲是一種侮辱，而感到忿怒，它還是容忍着，祗裝作沒有看見。可是最使它感到傷心的，却是看見主人穿着玻璃鞋的時候那種愉悅的笑容（這顯然表示是十分喜愛這個新　的），可就再也忍不住了，它悲傷嘆息，最後終於淌下了眼淚。</p>
<p>「難道我就從此絕望了麼？」</p>
<p>當藝鞋在屋角裏一天又一天地等候着主人的恩寵，而一天又一天地失望的時候，它發出了這樣的嘆息。</p>
<p>後來有一天，舊鞋看見主人匆匆地出門去，一會兒又匆匆地回來了，後面跟着一個收買舊貨的，主人沒有多說什麽話，便從屋角裏取出舊鞋，拋在那個舊貨商人的籮筐裏。</p>
<p>舊鞋立刻知道了將要發生什麽事情，道回它眞正是被主人遺棄了，它看見主人的臉上一點沒有憐惜之色，於是它忿怒着，詛咒着，想掙扎反抗想高聲呼喊，想從那個舊貨商人的手裏掙脫出來、</p>
<p>在一切努力都歸無效的時候，舊鞋便只好默默地躺在籮筐裏，將命運託付給那個舊貨商人了。</p>
<p>那個舊貨商人到了大街上，舊鞋忽然爲街上的喧鬧所驚醒，它睜起眼睛從籮筐裏望出去，這回它才眞正看到了上海，繁華，熱鬧，新鮮，似乎一切都和它的故鄕山城不同，至少在山城的街上看不見這麽許多閃光的東西，舊鞋看得眼花撩亂，一時竟辨認不出這些閃光的東西究竟是什麼，只見人們的頭上身上手上和脚上，都是光輝燦爛，奪人眼目，舊鞋再定神仔細看看的時候，才大大地吃了一驚，原來像主人脚上所穿的玻璃鞋，在街上竟到處可以看見，這無異碰到了敵人，它氣忿得幾乎要大吼起來。</p>
<p>世間的事情的確有許多是舊鞋簡單的頭腦所不能瞭解的，爲什麼自己一到了上海，便被主人遺棄了呢？爲什麽人們一到上海就改變了呢？這些問題在舊鞋的腦子裏縈廻着，怎麼也想不通。</p>
<p>後來舊鞋終於想到了一些不着邊際的事情，似乎可以解答那些問題，又似乎不可能，它想在上海嗅不到山城那樣的淸潔新鮮的空氣，看不到山城那樣的空關無際的天空，和到處開着花朶的山野，由於道些它便無端地厭惡起上海而懷戀起山城來了，它愛那個山城，愛那兒靜靜地流着的江水，愛那兒遍地芳草的山坡，一甚至連那兒冬天寒冷的霧，和夏一天灼熱的太陽也愛起來了。</p>
<p>如今舊鞋躺在這個冰冷的籮筐裏，十分珍惜着自己底上殘留着從那個山城帶來的泥土，這就更其引起它懷念起過去的日子，那眞是一個夢，一個遙遠的夢啊！</p>

<h3>上海到了</h3>
<p>— 介丁</p>
<p>小火輪走了一整天，還沒有覺得疲乏，在黄浦江中的速度更快，不斷激衝着江水的浪花。從船窗望出去，看到龍華機塲上帶着紅綠燈的飛機在起飛下降；從花旗大軍艦旁駛過，那些水手在嘻笑；避開那些有紅燈閃爍的江中碇石，一排排有亮方塊的洋房黑影也向後退去；漸漸看淸江海關上的大鐘。遂到了外灘公園的角上，冬夜，外灘是悄靜的。旁邊的外白渡橋上閃亮的車子梭似地來往着。</p>
<p>「到了，」大家都伸一伸坐得很疲乏的身子，忙不逮地整理東西，換上上岸的衣服。</p>
<p>「七點鐘就到了，道條船算快的。」一般人說，我向外面一看，江海關的大鐘正示著　七時正。</p>
<p>突然，船身反向外去，機房的馬達已經暫停，船酒醉似地幌了幌，有人抓緊了窗檻。</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>「進不來口，船擠得一塌糊塗。」船上的篙手說。</p>
<p>篙手撑着喊着，一條條大木船緩緩地向外淌，桅桿，纜繩亂的一團糟。</p>
<p>「撑住撑住！」篙手見木船橫撞過來，速忙跳過去，兩只手撑住了自己的船，使勁把脚蹬開去。</p>
<p>「媽的，不生眼睛的？」</p>
<p>船這麽多，讓得開？」</p>
<p>船上交詬着，不知發生在那條船上。</p>
<p>我伸出頭去一看，眞忙！許多人亂糟糟去拖了篙子在船上跑，滿吳淞江都是木船，我們船前也有一條火輪在擠啊讓地，靠岸邊的木船上的水手們却沒事人似地在燈影下吃飯。</p>
<p>「蓬」地一聲，一條竹篙忽地戳過來，正戳在我依着的窗檻上，我連忙縮回伸出着的身子。</p>
<p>船更近外灘公園了，園角圓燈下，一男一女在擁抱着；兩似戴鴨舌帽的依着鐵欄杆看船，黑黄的江水冲激着那已有坍壞的石坎岸，我們後面又是兩條火輪鑽屁股跟着，叮噹打鈴聲，馬達忽響忽停，船相撞的沉重聲音，和着咤喝，嘈嚷，竹篙，江水……江面是鬧得可以，像日中的聯合商塲。</p>
<p>白渡橋上電車，汽車，大卡車，閃亮地隆隆地駛過，「嘟－吧！……各式的汽笛呌着，「嗚！」黃浦江中的軍艦在怒吼。</p>
<p>一只只大木船，空的滿的，人跑着，桅杆船板橫亂着，從蘇州河中吐出來，緩緩地，永無終止似地。</p>
<p>一條方的登陸艇後面搶上來，馬達軋軋地震響，「嗚嗚」地猛呌，「讓開讓開！」艇上的水兵高喊着，木船極勉强地擠一條隙縫，船上更亂，碰撞的聲音更多。那艇擠進了河去，木船又合攏來，無盡止地向外緩緩撑着撑着。</p>
<p>外灘公園裏擁抱的一對已經走開，戴鴨舌帽的却有了三位，指手劃脚地似單在談論什麼，血紅的香烟火在墨黑的身影上閃亮。園中的圓燈始終沒動，有一塊塊亮方塊的百老匯大厦，聳立在黑暗的天空中，繪下了更濃的剪刀影。黃浦江中已被木船構成一條黑暗影子，蘇河中還是無盡止地吐……</p>
<p>好容易前面那條船動了，我們的船也發動了馬達，河上似更有些鬆動，向江海關的大鐘望去，長針仍舊指在十二時，短針却已到了九時，隱的可聽到鐘聲在響，我們船後却又跟了一大串的火輪木船。</p>

<h3>帆</h3>
<p>— 蔣敦</p>
<p>——帆是詩的，給人以智慧</p>
<p>帆，飽飲着風浪，飽飲着陽光，漂泊在無邊的海洋上，……</p>
<p>帆載滿了離愁，載滿了歡欣，從天涯到海角，像一位飽經滄桑的流浪的歌者，厭倦了這不安定的生活，憧憬那幸福的恬靜的海港。但是，帆，註定了是漂泊的命運，一段驚險的航程完畢了，靠攏了那親切的岸，又一段新的航程在期待着它。爲了渡更多的人到他們所慷憬的彼岸，帆又載着每個人的希望與理想，離開了安靜的海港，離開了慰藉過它的辛勞，知道它痛苦的岸邊，向飄天，去迎接那滿天的風浪！</p>
<p>帆在萬頃碧波的湖面上，盪漾着銀色的影，在和那天空的白雲比一比美麗，帆影，像一個美麗的夢。在春風吹綠了的江岸，映着陽光的帆，多麽年靑啊，給人以鼓舞，以生命的力，帆，召示着你向前，向前，向着你所憧憬的地方。</p>
<p>在臨江的窗前，一面帆影，就將你帶到圖畫中去；在多霧的嘉陵江上，你看到一面帆，就知道有與你同路的人，你就不感到寂寞。在險惡的灘上，前面猙獰的山崖旁，飄着一面帆影，會使你减少恐怖，知道灘並不能阻止帆的前進，而且前面有更寬廣的路！</p>
<p>那一些不甘自我的溫飽，爲大多數人追求更多的幸福的人，那些不甘於心靈的硬化，而永遠尋覓着更新鮮的事物的人，都將是愛帆者，而他們也都是人海中一面倔強的風帆啊！</p>
<p>帆是詩的，帆給人以智慧。</p>
<h3>松花江的月亮　桐窗雜憶之五</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>山海關外就沒有好風景嗎？要是這麼想，爲什麼從那個地方掀起了戰爭呢？實在，東三省是一塊好地方。北方的冬天，是會格外顯出北方的偉大來的，從大連，坐了火車在南滿鐵道上旅行，在暖氣管的旁邊，隔着雙重玻璃，從牕望出去，是一片白皚皚的雪，除雪外，看不見別的柬西，看起來特別小的月亮，高懸在冰冷的天空，照着銀盤似的大地，是「寒空照萬里　，冰雪滿山河」的景色。這是多麽大的一片土地！從大連到瀋陽，火車就得走一天　一晚，從瀋陽到哈爾濱，到長春，吉林，還有更遠的路程，更多的地方，更厚的雪，更冷的冰。這一片大地上有森林，煤礦，金藏，大豆，高梁，月亮照出這一片大地的幅員的棉廣來。</p>
<p>但是有情趣的，莫過於松花江上的月亮。「松花江」這名字，是那麼美，是松樹上的花飄在水面上的一條江嗎？如果這麼想，那一定是長白山上的松樹上的花，隨着江水飄過來了。但其實不然，松花江的美，是有月亮的晚上。吉林城外，南山和北山之間，松花江的水在這裏流過去。這一個地方有「小江南」的名稱。山海關外何嘗沒有春天，到春天，這裏是百花盛開，綠樹搖風，冰雪全化究了，人們在郊外尋樂，蹦蹦戲，大鼓，是常被羣衆欣賞的藝術。這裏人說的話比其他地方來得好</p>
<h3>黃河　桐窗雜憶之六</h3>
<p>抗戰前，坐着京漢車通過黄河鐵橋，因爲鐵橋的保險期已過，火車小心地慢慢地駛過，頭伸出窗外，可以俯瞰有名的黄河。但黄河，並不像長江那麽寬，有那麽大的水。河牀中堆滿着沙泥，像無數的島，水在沙縫裏湍流，而這沙是常常成團地亂滾，隨時移動其方位，因此，黄河實在是不適於行舟的水道，要不然，黃河裏爲什麼沒有輪船在那裏面疾駛呢？在水較深，泥較少的地方，成了黄河的渡口，這裏可以用民船運載人和物，但船也只能在沙縫中找到水道來走，成羣拉牽的人，就在沙堆上用力帮助撑篙的人，像長江裏的船一樣，一帆風順地走着，除了下游，黄河裏實在沒有，所以黄河倒幷不是一定利於交通的河流，反過來說，有時候，上游的水來得急，下游積滿了沙泥，水就決開了河堤，這就成了「黄災」了。我在黄河邊上的開封住了些日子。開封至今不被水淹，是意外的幸運。人可以看得出開封的地勢比黄河低得多，城裏的晋代遺物鐵塔的尖，實在常在黄河的水平錢下，如果決口，這裏的人就成了魚鱉了。前淸時候，政府爲了黄河特設一個「河台」，每年費了鉅數的國幣，修理河堤，常有決口的時候。民國以來，這個官職和經費取消了，但黄河竟不決口，請想，是什麽道理呢？曾經有人疑惑，是官吏爲了要蹬明那筆鉅款的用處，所以常使黄河發動其威力，後來這筆錢旣然取消，人們就不打黄河的主意了。多少年來，這裏又有「黄河水利委員會」的設立，很多人將這名號拆開來讀：「黄河水，利委員，會」，但黄河幸而也不大決口，這是因爲不決口也可以領經費的原故，可見民主國家比君主國家實在好得多。</p>
<p>黄河其實不故意和人爲難，使他決口的，倒還是人，歷史上，爲了戰爭的關係，常有人將他決口，所以黄河常常改道，這次抗戰，黄河又改了一次道，這在黄河，它也是一種痛苦啊！</p>
<h3>詩談</h3>
<p>— 吳吞吳</p>
<p>「最高尙的詩，是沒有格律也可存在的。」</p>
<p>Coleridgi的話，未免說得太過火了。</p>
<p>沒有格律，高尙的詩，怎能傳達出她的高尙的全部或一面呢？</p>
<p>有些作品的內容。是「詩的」的，可當吳穿過藝術淺薄者的技吞巧手腕時，已嗅不出吳一點兒的詩意了！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>空中肇禍頻仍且談跳傘常識</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>空中客運，本甚安全，且跳傘須事先訓練，所以普通客機不備降落傘，但最近空運流年不利，東也出事，西也出事，如果你有跳傘常識，似乎要比旁人合算些！</p>
<p>保險傘有「坐包式」，「背包式」，「胸包式」「胸背包式」多種。坐包式是駕駛員用的，乘客以胸包式爲宜，在上機之前應將背帶穿好，將大腿部分的帶子收緊，在立直的時候感到太緊，坐下來和跳傘時就合式了。傘與背帶上均標有小條顏色，紅的配紅色，黄的配黄的，配錯了就扣不上，上飛機時把傘包提在手裏，上機以後放在近身，以後在飛機中走動最好提着走，免得臨時找不到傘。</p>
<p>緊急時候駕駛員判斷飛機發生故障，機械員無法在空中修復，或汽油告罄，地形不適於强迫降落，因此發出棄機信號，或者用無綫電廣播，或者用紅燈，乘客準備跳傘，把傘包扣在胸前，把艙門放開，有緊急開放法，用紅色標出，如法施行，艙門即與飛機脫離，坐在門近處的先跳，不可爭先恐後。跳傘的方法，各種主張，但主張的不外數點，第一是兩腿合攏，不可分開，這樣在空中成一擺錘，不致過度翻轉，第二是兩手放在胸前。這樣非但可以减少阻力，迅即離開飛機，而且保險傘的拉柄，就在胸前。祗要神智淸醒，決不致於找不到拉柄，跳出飛機以後，沉着的人，一定可以看到自己離飛機已有相當距離，然後把拉柄用力拉動，保險傘即行張開，拉得太早，保險傘會糾纏在飛機之任何下垂部分，那是非常危險的！</p>
<p>飄飄若仙保險傘在空中如果震盪得太厲害，可以利用保險傘的繫索來調整，使傘的形狀改變，而保持其平穩，一般的人在空中是絕對淸醒的，將接觸地面務須隨風勢跌倒，在軍隊中練習翻筋斗，爲跳傘必要技能之一部分。能翻筋斗及能作京劇中吊毛者，落地時不致受傷。余在威廉士飛行學校時，跳傘敎官以跳傘落地時之姿態，比作醉漢，最爲恰切。</p>
<p>傘之包裝與保管爲安全之先決條件，每隔若干日，必須打開凉乾，重行包裝。負責包裝之人須在紙牌上簽字，倘跳傘時有拉不開之情形，其責任由包裝人負之，可治以極峻之罪。保險傘不可沾有油潰及水漬，在飛行塲及飛機中不可當坐墊用！</p>
<p>材料以國產紡綢爲佳，輸入品則以尼龍（俗稱玻璃絲）爲上，每方寸經緯線數及拉力均有一定，此項保險傘之載重量約數十倍於人之重量，故絕對可安全降落，而無中途破裂之虞。</p>
<p>保險傘材料爲綢質中最佳之品，宜於作女子禮服，余有同學數人，在歐洲作戰跳傘得生，以保險傘裁製其新夫人之結婚禮服，生面別開，亦庽有英雄美人之佳意也。</p>
<h3>甜甜蜜蜜，用途無窮　閒談萬能的糖</h3>
<p>— 成琮</p>
<p>在戰時，糖是極重要的軍事工業原料。因爲沒有酒精，人造橡皮就要失敗，而製造酒精，需要大量的糖。還有其他軍事需要，小至Ｋ字食匣，大至戰艦的髤漆不止數百種，都需要巨量的糖　。在一九四四年，僅是軍用糖菓一項，已經消費食糖一萬萬磅。</p>
<p>現在戰事已經束，食糖還是缺乏。要明白這原因，我們的注意力不可僅限於糖菓，冰洪淋，和甜酒一類柬西。在戰前糖和水一樣的不足爲奇。雖然人身的熱力百分之十五全靠糖供給，一般人對於糖大都不很明瞭，不知道究竟有什麽用處。</p>
<p>糖除掉是最經濟的生命之源以外，尙有其他極重要的用途。在化學家心目中，糖竟是一條魔棒，化學品的種類，層出不窮，都要糖担任製造的材料。幾千噸的糖用在藥品染料方面，幾十萬噸的糖，被吸收在油漆和軟玻璃的製造程序裏。對於這珍貴的糖，沒有一個星期沒有新的需要產生，這些新需要，都是化騐室裏科學家的傑作。</p>
<p>糖的時代　製糖的專家們認爲，在原子能時代之前，我們已經踏進炭水化合物的時代。他們預料，在不久的將來，要有大量的超燃料從糖或是糖的副產品製成，供給汽車和飛機應用。</p>
<p>糖實在是日光的積儲，是自然界供給的包裝好的熱力。在綠色葉子裏，日光把人類呼出的炭氣和水化合起來，產生糖質，這是人類生命的基本化學品，是人類生存所寄託的要素。沒有別種化合物可以把日光的力量存儲起來，給人類隨時應用。</p>
<p>這種大自然的秘密方法，吸收和保藏太陽發射在地球上的熱力。地球上每年儲藏在糖裏面的熱力的總和，超過燃燒三千萬萬噸煤斤所發出的熱力。</p>
<p>普通認爲糖是最甜的物品，其實不然。牠在甜品的次序表裏，差不多末一位了。像糖精，雖沒有糖那樣適口，可是比糖甜三百倍。</p>
<p>大家知道植物性的糖有二種，一是從甘蔗提煉的，一是從甜菜提煉的，用甜菜製糖的方法，在二百年前尙沒有人知道。至一七四七年德國柏林理科大學馬格拉夫博士第一個發明道方法。</p>
<p>第二次大戰時，美國有食糖代替品出現。美國農業部製成特種蘋果漿，供家常食用。牠俱有琥珀的顏色，味道不像蘋果，但是甜度很濃，並且備有食糖的優點。</p>
<p>需要浩繁　糖除了餐時食用，做糖菓，和冰洪淋之外還有許多用處。在製造强度水泥，配尼西靈，紙張，炸藥，和人造橡皮方面，都有牠的地位。大量的糖，用在製造尼隆纖維。牠可以免除極精細的纖維，在初製成時互相黏着。有許多上等汽油現在也是用糖製造。還有血漿，軟玻璃，和皮革的製造，和肉類的保藏，都要用着糖，對於烟草的保藏，糖也非常重要。牠可以使烟味格外淸香，牠也可用來製造玻璃。有幾種重要的物品，像乳酸，一烷醛，檸檬酸，製造也用糖做材料。</p>
<p>藥品，染料，油漆和燃料之外，還有無窮的產品，從化學家的糖缸裏出來，糖還是人類最經濟最有力的食品。一磅糖發出的熟力，等於一磅菠菜的熱力的十倍。一便士的糖，供給二七〇卡路里的熱力，而一便士的肉，所生的熱力，不到十個卡路里。</p>
<p>糖是大自然的產物，牠有前途，有出產，而且對於人類福利和文化進步極有關係。將來的需要，一定是日見增大。</p>

<p>— 郁强</p>
<p>「離婚城」里諾（Reno）的大名早已傳遍全世界，甚至ＧＩ從外國携歸的妻子，當他們發覺丈夫的窘態或叧有所歡時，竟也會到里諾去住上六個禮拜，向法院提出離婚的控訴。</p>
<p>里諾是內華達州（Nevada）的一個小城，但是在火車站上却寫着如下的一行字：「世界上最大的小城」！按照內華達州的法律，祗要在該州居住六個月就能獲得公民權，可是，更快速的，僅需居住六個禮拜和裝模做樣的宣誓一下，就能够提出離婚訴訟。</p>
<p>通常，到達里諾的離婚者常常是很傷感的樣子。除非她們（到里諾去離婚的人四分之三是女子）有朋友在那裏「等候時間」或者是道地的本地人，沒有人在火車站上迎接效——除了一個她所不認識的圓滑的紳士，他立即自我介紹是當地的一名律師。</p>
<p>「現在不要爲任何事情煩惱」。他的開塲白常是如此。「你就會喜歡這裏　，我會照料一切的」。</p>
<p>且忘煩惱的確，他會照料一切。而且，律師的帳房先生在臨時會將「一切」都開在帳單上，金額視離婚者的境况而定——大槪是三百五十元美金到十萬元美金。獲得鉅額的贍養費的女子是律師們的最好的主顧。</p>
<p>第一步，律師要替她解決膳宿問題。因爲膳舍有着，非獨解決了問題的本身，並且確定了她住在里諾。她也許住在里諾的最時髦的「河濱旅館」。也許她住在美麗的牧塲旁邊的一所小屋內，以漁獵消磨六個禮拜。假如她是有聲望，有錢或有其他超衆之點，律師便不會將「財神爺」放手，而將她迎歸自己家中，奉之爲上賓。當大富翁烏爾華滋的繼承人巴蓓拉·赫頓到里諾來離婚時，他的律師讓出了自己的房子，打發他的家庭去度「假期」，而以每月三千元美金的租金，讓給他的事主住。</p>
<p>里諾怎探會成爲「離婚城」呢？事情發生於一九〇〇年，當時里諾有一位叫皮爾·許尼茲的律師，在全美的電影說明書，報紙和雜誌上大登廣吿：</p>
<p>你想離婚嗎　「請讀內華達州的離婚律。你有家庭的糾紛嗎？你想離婚嗎？你要迅速而可靠的訴訟嗎？請通知我」！</p>
<p>於是離婚案件如潮水般往里諾流，許尼茲律師却因此而被剝奪了律師資格，但是這不過是在較保守的當時，內華達州政府一種保留面子的手段而已。許尼茲後來又被允許出庭了。</p>
<p>離婚案不但讓律師們發了財里諾法庭每年的贏餘也很可觀。除了糾纏着孩子的領養，或者贍養費的調解的離婚訴訟。其他的離婚訴訟，無論理由如何牽强細微，沒有不如願以償的。</p>
<p>當六個禮拜的「法定時間」期滿後，通常的訴訟程序如次：在早晨，原吿向法院呈遞狀紙。律師和證人都在。當開庭時，「精神虐待」等一大套理由統統搬出來，同時還要立一個「永久居住」的「誓。」雖然里諾的定居的人口，並不因此而增加，但是法官們還是莊嚴的，毫無內疚的聽取道種千篇一律的誓言。再後來，就是法官宣判，可說是絕少例外，判辭總是「准予離婚」。</p>
<p>如以離婚與結婚的數量而言，里諾實在應該譽之爲「結婚城。」因爲該城每年的結婚者實在比離婚者爲多。這個現象乍看起來好像有些奇怪，仔細一想，確是合理。因爲離婚者在事前大都另有新歡，一旦與「舊人」脫輻，便立即與新人結合。兩個離婚者可以變成四個結婚者，所以結婚反而超過離婚。再加以內華達州對再娶或再嫁的間隔的日期，並無法律的限制，外州的焦急的再婚者便蠢擁的到里諾去取得再婚資格。於是，結婚更多過離婚了。兩者相差最多時竟成五與一之比，這是一九三九年的事，結婚者一萬一千另六十一對，經法院批准離婚者二千二百三十一對。</p>
<p>里諾的木身，是怎樣的一個城市呢？它和其他的美國小城一樣。定居的人民過着正常的生活，不爲城中的「婚姻貿易」所騷擾。里諾有它的學校，敎堂，高爾夫球塲；也有它的聞人，銀行家，掮客，律師，牧童和大學生。有一點，里諾和其他的擁有二萬五千名居民的美國小城不同：里諾有機會看到那些「臨時同鄕」怎樣生活，吵架，酌酒和哭叫。從這些悲慘的例子中，里諾變成一個不十分受那些來來往往的人們的影響的較穩定的城市。</p>

<h3>American Side Withdraws from Three-Man Group, Announces Abandonment of Mediation Work, Executive Headquarters Personnel Also Completely Withdraw</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 29th] The State Department recently announced that the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China, which was involved in mediating the Chinese civil war, will soon withdraw. The State Department stated that the U.S. government believes that continuing to mediate the Chinese party dispute is a waste of time and energy. This opinion is related to the U.S. government's formal statement abandoning mediation of the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists. The State Department continued, stating that the United States has decided to terminate its relationship with the Three-Man Group and withdraw the American personnel from the Military Mediation Headquarters. They will soon leave the Military Mediation Headquarters.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] State Department Press Officer McDermott issued a statement from the State Department stating that the United States is now withdrawing from all efforts to mediate the Nationalist-Communist dispute. In response to questions, McDermott stated that regarding the U.S. Marine Corps in China, "instructions will be issued shortly in accordance with the approved U.S. plan to cease participation in the Military Mediation Department."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] U.S. Embassy spokesman Connors announced at 6:00 PM on the 29th that the U.S. government has decided to terminate its connection with the Military Three-Man Group and the Military Mediation Department, and the U.S. personnel of the Military Mediation Department will withdraw as soon as possible. The Military Three-Man Group was composed of Marshall, Zhang Qun, and Zhou Enlai. It was originally established in Chongqing with Marshal Marshall as its chairman. The Military Mediation Department was organized by the group and was located in Beiping. The three parties' selections were decided on January 11th of last year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] U.S. Embassy spokesman Connors issued a statement at the embassy at 6:00 PM on the 29th, stating: "The U.S. government has decided to terminate its connection with the Military Three-Man Group, which was established in Chongqing with the aim of ending the conflict in China, and Marshal Marshall was the chairman of the group. The U.S. government has also decided to terminate its connection with the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, which was decided by the Military Three-Man Group to be established in Beiping with the aim of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement, repatriation, and the reorganization agreement of the national armed forces on the spot. The American personnel belonging to the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters will withdraw as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Envoy Conveys American Decision to Government and Communists</p>
<p>The spokesman also stated that at 4:30 PM on the 29th, U.S. Ambassador Stuart visited Chairman Chiang and conveyed the U.S. government's decision. On the same day at 5:30 PM, Ambassador Stuart also met with Wang Bingnan of the Chinese Communist Party at the embassy and asked him to convey the decision to Yan'an.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 29th] The U.S. Embassy announced the termination of its connection with the Beiping Military Mediation Department, which in effect means that the United States has completely ended its mediation of the Chinese civil war. The American personnel of the Military Mediation Department, led by Lieutenant General Gillem, will withdraw as soon as possible. The American personnel belonging to the Military Mediation Department number about 3,000, including transport personnel from the air transport team. The Marines belonging to the Military Mediation Department, who are responsible for transporting supplies and performing a small number of guard duties, will also withdraw at the same time. The Military Mediation Department began implementing the armistice agreement on January 13, 1946, and it has been approximately one year since then. Observers generally believe that the Military Mediation Department will soon end. The above decision was made today after Marshall's discussions in Washington. This is tantamount to the United States completely abandoning mediation of the Chinese civil war and eliminating the only factor on the battlefield that could potentially prevent war. The Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party will probably also soon withdraw their personnel in the Beiping Military Mediation Department and the executive groups in various locations.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Decides to Dissolve, Gillem Guarantees Return of Communist Personnel, American Troops to Withdraw from North China Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] After the U.S. State Department announced the withdrawal of the Three-Man Group and the personnel of the Military Mediation Department, at 5:00 PM on the 29th, General Gillem, the American member of the Military Mediation Department, convened a meeting with Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the government, and Ye Jianying, the Communist member (Xue Zizheng attended as representative), and informed the Nationalist and Communist sides of the announcement by the U.S. State Department. The three parties decided to dissolve the Military Mediation Department, but the specific methods are still awaiting further meetings for discussion. Government member Zheng Jiemin is still in Beijing and has not returned. Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi did not say a word about this matter. The Communist spokesman stated that this is a natural result of the development of the situation and is not surprising. The fate of the Military Mediation Department was probably decided when Marshall returned to the country.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 29th] General Gillem, the American member of the Military Mediation Department, notified the government and Communist members today that the United States has decided to withdraw from the armistice organization. Gillem also guaranteed that "the American side will assist Communist personnel in returning to any location with the necessary time." It is expected that American personnel and their families will begin to withdraw immediately, which can be completed in about a month. The American part of the Military Mediation Department has one thousand officers and soldiers and female military service members, and at least 125 family members of officers and soldiers are also in Beiping. Another 21 family members have already boarded the U.S. Army transport ship "Whittier," which is scheduled to arrive in Tanggu on the 30th. The American part of the executive groups and liaison teams are scattered throughout North China and Northeast China, but it is expected that American personnel will not encounter difficulties returning to Beiping. There are sixteen executive groups in North China and eight in Northeast China, and airplanes can reach all of them. Although American personnel will begin to withdraw immediately, they still intend to maintain a sufficient number until the Communist representatives in the Beiping Military Mediation Department and the Changchun forward branch have returned to the Communist area. Currently, there are no Communist representatives in the groups in the government-controlled area, and there are no government personnel in the groups in the Communist area. The American part has a large amount of equipment in China, scattered in various locations, but they are all fully prepared to withdraw. Soon after the establishment of the Military Mediation Department, it formulated three withdrawal plans, two of which were intended to be implemented in an emergency. The third plan is more gradual, and there is no doubt that this plan will be implemented this time. It stipulates that officers, soldiers, family members, and female service members in China will be systematically transferred to the Pacific, such as Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and other islands, or returned to the United States to continue serving in the army. All equipment that would have to be abandoned in an emergency will also be transported out this time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 29th] The 4,000 American personnel of the Military Mediation Department and the 8,000 officers and soldiers of the 1st Marine Division stationed in North China to protect the facilities of the Military Mediation Department will all withdraw. After the withdrawal of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel, the only remaining U.S. troops in China will be the military advisory group stationed in Nanjing. The entire group, including the naval part, will not exceed 750 officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Beiping, 29th] The U.S. Marine Corps and the 332nd Detachment of the U.S. Army Air Corps in North China will withdraw from China soon. Well-informed sources predict that U.S. troops in North China will disappear next month. Because whether the Military Mediation Department itself is dissolved or not, since the American representatives have already withdrawn, there is no reason for the Marine Corps to continue to stay in China. At most, a small number of personnel will be stationed in Qingdao to assist the U.S. Navy in training Chinese naval students.</p>
<h3>Luo Longji's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the American side announced its withdrawal from the Three-Man Group, the Mediation Executive Headquarters, and the U.S. Marine Corps related to the mediation work, Luo Longji, the spokesman for the Democratic League, expressed his feelings as follows: The American withdrawal from the Three-Man Group and the Mediation Executive Department is a natural result after Marshal Marshall returned to the country. At the same time, it also indicates that the American mediation work in China has come to an end. It is hoped that the Chinese people can work hard in the future to promote peace and solve their own problems. At the same time, China-U.S. relations have always been friendly. In the future, it is hoped that the United States will stand on the basis of friendship and help our country carry out peaceful construction.</p>
<h3>CCP Will Have a Reaction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently inquired about the Chinese Communist Party Office's thoughts on the American action. The answer was: Yan'an will have a formal reaction to this matter.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Government Statement Delivered to U.S. Embassy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department released the full text of the government's statement on the Communist Party's rejection of peace talks at a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 29th (see Central News Agency draft). When asked whether this statement had been delivered to the U.S. Embassy, Peng replied: Yes. When asked whether the government's statement indicated that the government's only policy in the future was to reorganize the government, and whether all parties could participate, and whether their places would be reserved if they did not participate temporarily, Peng replied: The government hopes that the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party can participate. As for whether the Communist Party and the Democratic League will reserve their places, it will be considered in the future. There is no such provision in Sino-British trade</p>
<h3>Inland Navigation Is Not Open</h3>
<p>There is no such provision in Sino-British trade</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Rumors that the Chinese government will re-grant British merchants the right to navigate inland rivers and conduct coastal trade when negotiating the Sino-British trade treaty are absolutely untrue, according to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the government.</p>
<h3>American Side Withdraws from Military Mediation Department Work, Fails to Promote Our Peace, Remarks by a Political Observer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the American side formally announced its abandonment of mediation work, withdrawal from the Military Three-Man Group, the Mediation Executive Headquarters, and the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China related to the mediation work, a certain authoritative political observer in this city expressed his feelings as follows:</p>
<p>This decision by the United States is clearly due to the fact that the American people and authorities do not understand the correct situation of China's political progress. The main reason why our country's politics cannot embark on the path of unity and peace is that the CCP insists on non-cooperation, non-participation in peace talks, and non-participation in the government, and restrains other political parties from adopting the same attitude. If the CCP continues to adhere to this position, it will be very difficult for China to achieve true unity. The Chinese people are well aware that the United States has provided us with various valuable assistance during the war. After the victory, it never requested the early withdrawal of the U.S. military. The so-called actions to demand the withdrawal of the U.S. military have clearly been initiated behind the scenes and cannot represent the true public opinion. Now, the sudden withdrawal of troops by the American side inevitably makes people believe that they are being used by people with a background and an intention. In fact, this sudden action will not only not promote China's peace and unity, but will increase the power of those who undermine peace and have ambitions.</p>
<h3>Government Decides to Expand the Foundation, Hopes that All Parties and Factions Will Participate in the Work</h3>
<p>Special Important Statement on CCP's Rejection of Peace Talks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Zhong Yi Minister Peng Xuepei, at a press conference at 6:00 PM on the 29th, declared the National Government's statement on the CCP's rejection of peace negotiations, the original text of which is as follows: Since the government issued the ceasefire order on November 8th last year, it has been three months. During this period, the Communist Party not only did not jointly abide by the ceasefire, but also took advantage of this opportunity to launch a full-scale offensive from the Northeast to the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, and it has intensified to this day. The government, in order to earnestly hope for peace, has repeatedly exercised restraint and compromised in order to preserve a glimmer of hope for the country and the people and to achieve the goal of a political solution. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party formally rejected the government's proposal to send representatives to Yan'an to discuss the resumption of peace talks in advance, and now it has rejected the four-point peace plan proposed by the government, which is a great regret. The government is aware that the recently convened National Assembly has formulated a democratic constitution based on the principles jointly agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference. It is also aware that the government's reorganization plan is being actively discussed and prepared, so that all parties can participate in the work of the State Council Committee and the legislative, administrative, supervisory and other ministries, in order to realize the expansion of the government's foundation. Therefore, on the 24th of this month, Dr. Stuart was requested to inform the Chinese Communist Party of the government's following four wishes: (1) The government is willing to send personnel to Yan'an or invite the CCP to send personnel to Beijing to continue discussions or hold a round-table conference, inviting various parties and social figures to participate. (2) The government and the CCP should immediately order a ceasefire on the spot and agree on effective measures for the ceasefire. (3) The government is still willing to continue discussions on the principle of troop stationing, reorganization procedures, and the implementation of traffic restoration, based on the past agreements of the Three-Man Conference. (4) Before the implementation of the constitution, the government is willing to discuss with the CCP a fair and reasonable solution to the local governments in disputed areas. Now that the CCP has formally rejected peace talks and claimed that the government must first agree to its proposal to restore the military positions before January 13th last year and abolish the constitution passed by the National Assembly, this is tantamount to demanding that the National Government and the National Assembly be subject to the Communist Party and obey the Communist Party's orders, where will the Republic of China's nation and people be placed? Since the Political Consultative Conference and the Military Three-Man Group Conference were held last year, during this year, the government has done everything it can to expect the CCP and various parties to participate in the government, but it has failed to obtain their understanding. At this point, it can no longer hope for their participation. Since the CCP has made such a resolute statement, the only path that can be followed in the future is to implement the government's established policy and steps of political democratization, and it is still hoped that all parties and social figures will participate in the government with their patriotism and love for the people, so that the constitutional preparations can be completed as soon as possible and the constitution can be implemented as scheduled, and hope that they will work together with one heart and one mind to engage in construction, restore the economy, improve the lives of the general people, and work together on the great cause of nation-building. This is the only policy of the government in the future.</p>
<h3>Social Democratic Party Central Standing Committee Discusses Participation in the Government</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Will Return to Beijing in a Few Days</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Observers pointed out that the Social Democratic</p>
<h3>Central Standing Committee Regular Meeting Passes Organizational Regulations for Various Ministries</h3>
<p>Proposal Committee of the Third Plenary Session Divides into Four Working Groups</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Central Standing Committee convened a regular meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 29th, with more than 30 people attending. Chen Lifu chaired the meeting. First, there was a long exchange of views on the current situation. Secondly, the organizational regulations of the Proposal Committee of the Third Plenary Session were passed. The committee is divided into four groups: party affairs, politics, economy, and constitutional government. Each Central Standing Committee member serves in one or two groups. The organizational regulations for county-level executive committees and the organizational regulations for various central ministries were also passed.</p>
<p>It is currently difficult for the Youth Party and the two parties to participate in the government reorganization. As far as the Social Democratic Party is concerned, part of the party is idealistic, and the other part is realistic. They have different views on reorganizing the government, which is difficult to agree on. And Zhang Junle's scholarly demeanor did not exercise his due final decision-making power. As far as the Youth Party is concerned, there are also three major difficulties in participating in the government, namely: (1) the reorganization of local governments; (2) the selection of government personnel; (3) the unwillingness to participate in the government alone. Therefore, unless the situation changes or the government makes concessions, it is difficult to expect concrete results in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party continued yesterday, but because the views on participating in the government were not unanimous within the party, there was no concrete decision after fierce debate. It is now planned to rest for a few days and then discuss it again. However, the spirit of establishing a responsible cabinet system and adopting talentism is unanimously agreed upon by the internal members of the Social Democratic Party. And the spirit of this political system is also consistent with what is stipulated in the constitution. Also, the party believes that the reorganization of the government should start from the central government, which is different from the Youth Party's request for the simultaneous reorganization of local governments. Regarding the resumption of peace talks, the party also believes that peace is the basic requirement of the people, and if there is an opportunity, it should not be missed at any time, whether before or after the reorganization of the government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Youth Party convened the Central Standing Committee yesterday. In addition to the Shanghai-based standing committee members, the Beijing-based standing committee members also returned to Shanghai to participate, except for Zeng Qi, who stayed in Beijing due to business. The main purpose of the meeting was to review internal work and the reports of the standing committee members staying in Beijing. Some of the standing committee members plan to go to Hangzhou and Jiaxing for sightseeing after the meeting. Also, Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang set off for Beijing on the night train yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Tiecheng will return to Beijing in a day or two. The visit to the Social Democratic and Youth Party members the day before yesterday was mainly for New Year's greetings and to exchange views on the political situation by the way.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Will Go to Chengdu, Return to Beijing in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Reliable sources: Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan Province is scheduled to go to Chengdu in a few days, but it is understood that this trip is for the purpose of handing over matters and will return to Beijing in the short term.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Soviet Generals Meet, Agree on Liaison Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th] The Soviet military authorities on the front line of Pulandian met with the National Army on the 27th. The Soviet major general was Chalesski, the commander of the 1st Money Unit of Jinzhou. His entourage included Staff Officer Captain Wo Ri Kuofu, Lieutenant Xie Miaowofu, Lieutenant Maslov, Lieutenant Attendant Nasofu, Adjutant Weila Gelatov, Translator Gaosilov, and carried a radio station and a platoon of guards. The Chinese side participating in the talks included Zhou Pu, Lieutenant Colonel Zhou Jiugao, and staff, translators, and other personnel. It is heard that the talks were quite harmonious.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th] According to reports, the content of the talks between Soviet Major General Chalesski and National Army Colonel Zhou Pu included the Soviet side agreeing with us on future liaison methods between the two sides. Also in the talks, the National Army requested the Soviet side to disarm the Communist troops within its cordon, faithfully fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and assist the National Army in encircling and suppressing the Communist troops south of Pulandian.

<h3>Gong Xuesui Talks in Beijing, Dalian Reception is Approaching</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui repeatedly stated to our newspaper reporter on the morning of the 29th when talking about the Dalian issue that he believed that the reception of Dalian was not far away, and recognized that the legal basis for the reception of the area did not need further diplomatic negotiations. Various reports about Dalian are received here from time to time, but the details are difficult to ascertain. Only it is known that the people of the area are quite short of food, etc. due to being isolated from the outside world, and they all hope to return to the motherland soon. Gong himself has not visited Chairman Chiang or President Song recently, but before the real reception, he should ask for instructions on everything. Currently, all preparations for the reception are basically in place, and he can go there when the situation permits. In the future, all the municipal government personnel will retain those assigned by the former mayor Shen Yi at that time. If the local staff originally in the area are loved by the people, they should also be appointed as much as possible. From now on, the city's policy guidelines will be aimed at internationalization and centralization. The former is intended to make Dalian an important international port, and the latter is intended to clear the situation of specialization that has existed for more than 50 years. These days, he is busy collecting various materials related to the port, and is preparing to compile a Dalian guide. When the reporter visited, Gong was reading various books and showed the reporter a newly acquired large map of Dalian, explaining in detail where the harbor was and where the downtown area was. Gong promised to allow reporters from various newspapers to visit together during the future reception, so that the true image of this land that has been separated from the motherland for a long time can be known to the world.</p>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Hosts Reporters, Minister Peng and Vice-Minister Liu Attend to Answer Questions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 6:00 PM on the 29th. Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice-Minister Liu made the following replies to inquiries from various reporters:</p>
<p>Economic Plan</p>
<p>(1) Can the minister tell us about the details of the economic five-year plan formulated by the government? Has a political five-year plan been considered? If so, what are the details? Peng replied: The Central Design Bureau once formulated an economic construction plan, which has been sent to the Executive Yuan. This was about a year ago. Due to the instability of the situation, large-scale construction cannot be carried out, and there is no news of a five-year political plan.</p>
<p>Recent War Situation</p>
<p>(2) The CCP claims that the war situation in the past three months has been favorable to them. Is there any factual basis for this? What has the government lost or gained since November 1st? What are the casualties of the government army during this period? Peng replied: You know from newspaper records that the Communist Party's claims have no basis. The National Army is said to be progressing smoothly everywhere. Although the Communist Army attempted to make a last-ditch effort in southern Shandong, the National Army is confident. Our goal is the unity and peace of the country, so we do not want to over-publicize the gradual recovery of cities. However, since you have requested it, I will ask the military authorities to publish a detailed table in the near future. There are no detailed statistics on casualties yet. (3) Is it true, as reported by the outside world, that General Jiang Dingwen went to the United States to conduct negotiations in order to receive a large amount of military supplies from the Philippines and India? Peng replied: This is a complete fabrication. (4) Is the government restricting the import of newsprint, as reported by the outside world? Peng replied: All imports must be approved by the government. It has not yet been determined how much newsprint can be imported this year.</p>
<p>Xisha Incident</p>
<p>(5) It is reported that French troops have landed on two small islands in the Xisha Islands. What steps has the government taken? (6) Has the Chinese government formally expressed anything to the French government regarding this matter? For the above two questions, Deputy Foreign Minister Liu replied: As far as the Chinese government knows, some French troops have landed on Batou Island in the Xisha Islands from a patrol boat. No one has landed on Wu Island. Today, I can only report this. However, I would like to take this opportunity today to solemnly deny the statement made by the French Foreign Office that China agreed to France's occupation of the Xisha Islands in 1938. China only reiterated its consistent position at that time. China's sovereignty over the islands is indisputable.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam</p>
<p>(7) Does the Chinese government plan to evacuate overseas Chinese from French Indochina, especially Hanoi? Liu replied: The Chinese government is planning to restore air traffic between China and Vietnam. If the French authorities agree, we hope to have civilian flights between Nanning and Hanoi for relief purposes. The Chinese government is using various methods to supply rice and other grains to the overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong, and to provide them with air transportation to communicate with the country. The French authorities in Hanoi are also trying to provide rice, salt, dried fish, and other items to help the overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Military sources have confirmed that Ding County, on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, fell to the Communist forces on the evening of the 27th after several days of intense fighting.  Street battles raged throughout the night.  By noon on the 28th, the entire city was in Communist hands.  Major fires have broken out in several locations within the city, and important buildings are currently being destroyed.  The whereabouts of over a thousand defending troops, four hundred railway protection police, more than one hundred and sixty railway employees, as well as Ding County Party and government personnel, are unknown. This is the greatest loss in any of the many county-level city defense battles in Hebei Province.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] The fall of Xinle County, on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, has also been confirmed.  Zhengding and Xin'an stations, north of Shijiazhuang, lost contact this morning after being attacked yesterday. Xin'an and Dongweishou forces are still engaged in fierce fighting across the Mudao Gou (Wooden Knife Gully), so these two stations may not be lost.  Except for the ongoing fighting at Mudao Gou, the 250 li stretch between Baoding and Zhengding is now completely under Communist control.  A division of the National Army has arrived from the Chahar region to reinforce Baoding, but is currently held up at Beihedian and Gucheng on the Ping-Bao section due to six further instances of railway sabotage, which occurred this morning. Fierce fighting also broke out yesterday between Baoding and Nan Zijiazhuang. National forces are awaiting an opportunity to advance south.  With the concentration of National Army forces in Shijiazhuang, there is no cause for alarm. A division of a certain army is expected to arrive in Shijiazhuang via the Zhengtai Railway within days, and airborne reinforcements are also planned.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Due to the Communist army's second major offensive between Baoding and Shijiazhuang, the situation in Hebei Province has suddenly deteriorated. The plan to repair the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section has become a pipe dream. Relevant authorities say that the Communist army's offensive is a comprehensive one in response to Jin and Lu, with the main purpose of destroying railways and destroying National Army strongholds. Once National Army reinforcements arrive, the Communist army will retreat without a fight. Separately, qualified observers say that short-term chaos in Hebei Province is unavoidable. With the current situation, an additional two armies should be able to reverse the decline. Since peace talks have reached an impasse, the only way to resolve the matter is through strength. In the future, opening the Tianjin-Pukou and Ping-Han railways will be an essential means for the government. Compared with the two, the former is more important than the latter, so the restoration of the Ping-Han line will depend on the conclusion of the Battle of Southern Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] More than 5,000 Communist troops have arrived in Jiahe along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and more than 2,000 have arrived in Qing County. National Army forces in Cang County are watching their next move.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] According to aerial reconnaissance, the Communist army is mobilizing a large number of civilians to actively destroy railway bridges between Ding County and Dong Changshou. All bridges, large and small, made of iron, stone, and wood, have been destroyed by explosives, with the roadbed jaggedly displaced to form deep trenches. Railway track materials and sleepers have been burned. The extent of the damage is beyond calculation. In addition, the spring flood season is approaching, and the temporary pontoon bridges that were previously destroyed will need to be rebuilt to prevent spring floods, which is also a major difficulty in the repair work.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th] Nangle, which was previously captured by the Communist army in southern Hebei, has been recaptured by National Army forces on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 29th] (1) More than 3,000 Communist troops from the Tenth Brigade are currently fleeing from Wangdu to Yujiazhuang, while another unit of more than 8,000 is fleeing to the Caoqiao area, thirty li southeast of Baoding. (2) Communist army forces in western Baoding have been frequently redeploying in recent days, constantly attacking National Army strongholds, but have been repelled each time. (3) Three divisions of Liu Bocheng's forces have fled from Anguo to Dali Gezhuang, Dongxi Wangli, and other villages, thirty li southwest of Baoding, with unclear intentions. (4) Communist army Commander-in-Chief Nie Rongzhen is leading more than 10,000 troops, currently stationed in Wu Village, Mount Yue, west of Baoding, preparing to launch a new offensive against Baoding.</p>
<h3>郝鵬舉一度抵徐　謁陳總長等當日返海州　戰事重心已移魯豫邊境</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] Hao Pengju, the newly appointed Commander of the Lunan Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, arrived in Xuzhou by special plane from Haizhou at noon on the 29th, accompanied by Liu Cheng, Director of the Political Department. Chief of Staff Chen and Director Xue both sent representatives to welcome him at the airport. After disembarking, Hao and his party went to the Pacification Headquarters to meet with Chief of Staff Chen and Director Xue, report on the current situation, and make requests. Chief of Staff Chen and Director Xue hosted them for lunch, during which they praised Hao's loyalty to the government and gave words of encouragement. At 3 PM, Hao and his party returned to Haizhou on the same plane. When interviewed by reporters at the Xuzhou airport, Hao stated that the government has embarked on the path to democracy. Further internal strife would only waste the nation's vitality and destroy the people's happiness. The 42nd Army Group is now gathered around Haizhou and Ganyu, ready to launch pacification work in southern Shandong. Hao also said that Chen Yi's surveillance over him was extremely strict, and that his ability to safely lead his troops to pledge allegiance to the government is proof of Chen's declining power and impending doom. Hao was deeply moved by the warm welcome given to him in Xuzhou, saying that he will only work hard to pacify southern Shandong and accomplish his mission to repay the government.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Hao Pengju's forces are substantial. Currently, they are actively attacking in both southern and eastern Shandong, threatening Chen Yi's headquarters in Linyi. It is reported that two divisions have already advanced towards Chenjialing, Huandunbu, and Dongjiagou, east of Linyi, and may cut off the Communist forces' rear supply lines in that area from Juxian in the future.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 29th] More than 1,000 troops from the Communist army's Hubian Detachment, led by Hu Degao, attacked Laozhai Fangcun, southeast of Yutai, on the night of the 27th. They were intercepted by local militia and retreated in defeat.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 29th] The Communist army thoroughly destroyed the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mine before withdrawing. National Army forces re-entered Zaozhuang on the 27th. The main force of the Communist army in southern Shandong has been gathering towards Tancheng and south of Linyi in recent days, preparing for a major battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 28th] The Communist army forces of Li Xiannian are once again harassing the Funiu Mountain area, and besieging Lechuan (40 li southeast of Lushi). Our local militia defended bitterly for more than ten days. Finally, due to exhaustion of ammunition and food, and being outnumbered, they broke through the encirclement on the 20th, moved to a new position, replenished ammunition, and launched a counterattack.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] The situation on the border between Jiangsu and Shandong has completely improved. National Army forces have secured the safety of the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Eastern Railway, and firmly control the entire line from Taierzhuang to Zhaodun Station on the Longhai Eastern Railway. The defending forces in Taierzhuang, without fear of being cut off, are guarding more vigorously. Rumors that the Communist army is fiercely attacking Taierzhuang and that intense fighting has broken out have been proven untrue. The focus of the fighting has now shifted to the border between Shandong and Henan. Strong National Army forces are being reinforced from both the east and west towards Lanfeng, Minquan, Dangshan, Huangkou, and other places along the Longhai Line. According to qualified military sources, if the Communist army does not quickly stop its offensive on the border between Shandong and Henan, it will repeat the disastrous defeat of one year ago in eastern Henan and western Shandong. This can be stated definitively.</p>

<p>Yongchun Road Market Completely Destroyed, More Than 100 Households Affected</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] A major fire broke out in Changchun city on the morning of the 29th, affecting more than 100 households and causing property losses estimated at over one hundred million in circulating currency, but there were no injuries. According to a police investigation, at 2:50 AM on the 29th, a fire broke out in the basement of the Xindechang Grocery Store in the Yongchun Road Market due to careless roasting of vegetables. Because the entire market was made up of wooden buildings, although the fire brigade rushed to extinguish the blaze, the entire market was ultimately reduced to ashes.</p>
<h3>蘇魯邊區「民兵」　紛紛向郝部輸誠</h3>
<p>"Militia" in the Jiangsu-Shandong Border Region Pledge Allegiance to Hao's Forces</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] Donghai News: (1) After Hao Pengju led his troops to defect, Hao's forces stationed in Haima and other places have changed their insignia. One division of Hao's forces in Ganyu has replaced their hats with the Blue Sky White Sun emblem. (2) Since the day before yesterday, a portion of Hao's army has been participating in guarding the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Eastern Railway. (3) The majority of the so-called "militia" in the Jiangsu-Shandong border region, originally incorporated by Xu Xiangqian, has pledged allegiance to Hao's forces. Commander Hao is sending personnel to inspect them, and will select those of better quality to be incorporated into the 42nd Army Group, while the rest will be given funds and sent back to their original hometowns. (4) A portion of Hao's guerrilla forces, experienced in mountain warfare, is bypassing southern Shandong to establish a new base area deep within the Mengshan Mountains in Mengyin County. This force will pose a significant threat to the rear of the Communist army in southern Shandong.</p>

<h3>National Army Counterattack in Shanxi Province Approaches the Outskirts of Xiaoyi City</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th] A certain unit of the National Army has begun a counterattack against the Communist army that has invaded Xiaoyi, and on the 20th, recovered Sima Town and Tiantun strongholds, and is currently advancing towards the outskirts of Xiaoyi.</p>

<h3>Yellow River Ice Blocks as Large as Square Tables</h3>
<p>Adding Embankments at Huayuankou</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th] Following the recent heavy snowfalls in northwestern regions, ice blocks as large as square tables have been flowing down the Yellow River. The rocks dumped at the Huayuankou breach have reached a height of approximately seven meters. The breach in the pontoon bridge is approximately forty meters wide and ten meters deep. The blocking and restoration bureau is currently adding side embankments and lattice dams to both the north and south sides of the pontoon bridge, gradually extending them towards the middle. Although the water surface at the mouths of the original north and south diversion channels east of the breach has frozen, the water flow underneath has not stopped. In order to ensure smooth flow in the old channel, the blocking and restoration bureau plans to dig a diversion channel between the north and south diversion channels, and has begun surveying.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 28th] The head of the Yellow River's old course has passed Luokou and reached Huojialiu, which belongs to Licheng County. The flow velocity cannot be measured because the water surface is frozen. The water depth at Luokou has increased to three meters and two inches, and the width to forty meters.</p>

<h3>陳總長吿新四軍官兵　勸速覺悟來歸　共軍淮陽軍區司令投誠</h3>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen Addresses Officers and Soldiers of the New Fourth Army, Urging Them to Awaken and Return; Commander of the Communist Huaiyang Military District Defects</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] Chen Yi's forces have felt extreme panic due to Hao Pengju's allegiance to the government. Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng today printed a letter to the officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army, dispatched a special plane to Southern Shandong, advising them to awaken and return.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] Since Hao Pengju telegraphed his defection, the morale of the Communist army has been greatly shaken. Today, Zhang Shaowu, commander of the Communist Huaiyang Military District, also defected to the National Army and took up the new post of commander of the 7th Detachment of Jiangsu, with his troops now stationed in the vicinity of Suqian. [Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 28th] The situation in Southern Shandong will have a similar and remarkable development to Northern Jiangsu in the near future. This is the impression I got after inspecting the front lines of Southern Shandong. During this trip, I witnessed thousands of pure and good farmers, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing from the so-called liberated areas to the National Army's defense areas. On the western bank of the Grand Canal on the border between Shandong and Jiangsu, a magnificent scene of extreme human tragedy was formed. Conversely, the people in the National Army's defense areas, not a single family fled to the so-called liberated areas. The hearts of the people indicate the fate of the Communist army in Southern Shandong. The reporter arrived at the front line of Southern Shandong on the day that Hao Pengju telegraphed to take up his new post as appointed by the government. The military and civilians have always known that Chen Yi's surveillance of Hao's forces was extremely strict. Now that Hao has safely led his troops to pledge allegiance to the government, it shows on the one hand Hao's knowledge of great righteousness and general situation, and on the other hand exposes the gradual weakening of Chen Yi's forces and the loss of control over Hao. Front-line soldiers and civilians, receiving this good news, all felt that Chen Yi was approaching his end, and everyone felt excited. The reporter interviewed officers and soldiers of all levels on the front lines, who all held a belief of inevitable victory. One general even had the ambition to settle Southern Shandong within fifteen days. When the reporter inquired about the prospects of the Southern Shandong situation, he was told that the National Army had achieved a strategically advantageous situation after the Northern Jiangsu campaign. And give an easy-to-understand analogy, for the reporter to explain: In the past, the National Army spread its hands and was beaten, but now it clenched its fists, ready to fight.</p>
<h3>熊式輝返原籍　故宅僅剩斷瓦殘坻　附近村落一片荒凉</h3>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Returns to His Hometown; Only Broken Tiles and Rubble Remain of His Former Residence; Nearby Villages are Desolate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 28th] I accompanied Director Xiong Shihui back to his hometown in Yaji in Anyi on the 28th. After Mr. Xiong arrived at the station, the elders in the township greeted him in the wild with firecrackers. Passing through the Wanjiafu Experimental Area, which was established during Mr. Xiong's administration of Jiangxi, all the office buildings and various equipment were completely destroyed by the Japanese army, with only one stone pillar outside the gate remaining, bearing the marks of bullets. During the war, our guerrilla forces often operated in this area, attacking the enemy troops on the Nansun highway. Xiong's hometown, Yaji Long Village, suffered greatly after being destroyed by the Communist army in 1928, and then burned and killed by the Japanese army, severely damaging its vitality. Xiong's residence was burned down by the Communists in 1928, and now only the foundations of the walls remain. The houses of his neighbors on the left and right were also demolished by the Communist army, and his family temple was destroyed by the Japanese army, and is now overgrown with weeds. Xiong said: Before the war, the scale of the experimental area was quite successful. During the war, up to sixty villages in the vicinity were burned down by the enemy, and more than a hundred people were either killed or died participating in guerrilla warfare. He now plans to borrow money from the bank to rebuild the villages, and the provincial government plans to establish an agricultural support experimental area within the original experimental area to try out supporting independent farmers, and then promote it to other counties after it proves successful. Xiong discussed the reconstruction project with the elders in his hometown and tried to enrich the Yanggong Elementary School, which was established to commemorate his late father. He returned to the provincial capital at 7:30 PM. He will attend a welcoming meeting in Nanchang on the 29th and may leave the province for Nanjing on February 2nd to go to the Northeast. During this return to Jiangxi, Xiong repeatedly expressed his willingness to assist Chairman Wang Lingji with utmost sincerity in completing the great construction plan of the new Jiangxi.</p>

<h3>中國農行將發行　绥靖區土地債券</h3>
<h3>Agricultural Bank of China to Issue Pacification Zone Land Bonds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] It is learned that the Agricultural Bank of China will soon issue Pacification Zone Land Bonds, with the face value calculated in kind, totaling 10 million dan of rice and 10 million dan of wheat, with an interest rate of 4%.

<h3>Editorial: Congratulations on the Rebirth of Burma</h3>
<p>The British government issued a white paper yesterday, announcing the agreement reached in the Anglo-Burmese negotiations: (1) Burma will remain within the British Empire as a dominion, or secede completely and become fully independent, entirely at Burma's own discretion; (2) Burma shall elect a National Assembly in April to draft a constitution, and the representatives of the National Assembly shall be exclusively Burmese; (3) Before the new constitution comes into effect, Burma shall organize a provisional government, with an Executive Council composed of Burmese officials and a Governor-General appointed by the British, similar to the situation in India; (4) In principle, Burma is recognized to manage its finances during the transitional period and to command the entire Burmese army; (5) How to handle the British troops stationed in Burma after the new constitution comes into effect shall be dealt with by an agreement between Britain and Burma; (6) The borders of Burma will be determined later. At the same time, British Prime Minister Attlee and Lord Lawrence, Secretary of State for India and Burma, also announced the results of the Anglo-Burmese talks in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, respectively. With this official announcement by the British government, the foundation for Burma's autonomous rebirth has been laid. After a very short transitional period and the enactment of Burma's fundamental law, Burma will inevitably begin its new life. China and Burma are not only geographically adjacent but also as close as brothers. We express our infinite joy at Burma's rebirth and imminent independence. Upon hearing this good news, we hereby extend our sincere congratulations to the people of Burma.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Burmese talks were initially announced by British Prime Minister Attlee in Parliament on December 20th and began in London on January 13th. Burma sent its delegation to the British capital, headed by U Aung San, Vice-Chairman of the Government. When our newspaper learned of this news, we published an article entitled "A New Dawn for Burmese Independence," discussing Burma's independence and the Anglo-Burmese talks, believing that the convening of the talks itself was a cause for joy because "it indicates that a ruling nation and a ruled nation are willing to resolve all issues concerning the adjustment of their future relations through negotiations. It indicates that a ruling nation is willing to change its position in a peaceful manner to satisfy the wishes of the ruled nation; at the same time, it also indicates that a ruled nation is willing to fulfill its wishes in a peaceful manner. The convening of these Anglo-Burmese talks is itself a manifestation of a spirit of harmony and is worthy of our praise." We also said: "We believe that since both Britain and Burma have the intention to resolve the Burmese situation peacefully, the Anglo-Burmese talks to be held in London will certainly be successful." Now, the news from London confirms the success of the Anglo-Burmese talks, making our wish come true. We cannot but deeply admire the outstanding talent and statesmanship of the leaders of both Britain and Burma.</p>
<p>Most of the nations of Southeast Asia are ancient countries with rich cultures, but since the rise of Western European imperialism in the 19th century, they have successively fallen. Naturally, the people of these regions all expressed indignation. The Western European imperialist powers maintained their rule in various parts of Southeast Asia with their superior military force. After World War I, the high tide of nationalism spread to the various ruled nations of Southeast Asia. However, President Wilson's Fourteen Points, which included national self-determination, conflicted with the interests of Western European imperialism. The status of the various ruled nations of Southeast Asia still could not be improved. The United States knew that its rule over the Philippines would end one day. Therefore, before the Pearl Harbor incident, it had already promised to grant the Philippines independence. After Japan surrendered, this promise was immediately fulfilled. Among the various ruled nations of Southeast Asia, we first saw the independence of the Philippines. In the Dutch East Indies, the Indonesian national movement became even more active after Japan's surrender. Although there is still no agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesia, judging from the surging Indonesian national movement, the wishes of the Indonesian people will be realized sooner or later. At this time, we see the success of the Anglo-Burmese talks, and another Southeast Asian nation that was ruled has now achieved its goal of independence.</p>
<p>We cannot but deeply admire the wisdom of the policies adopted by the Attlee government. Due to the adoption of this wise policy, the strength of the British Empire has not only not been weakened, but it may even be strengthened as a result. Unrest within the Empire is enough to weaken its power. Attlee recognized this and, with foresight, allowed Burma to be completely independent. Whether it takes a dominion status within the British Empire or secedes from the British Empire to become completely independent is for Burma to decide for itself. This cannot but show the breadth of mind of the British. In fact, in these troubled times, although Britain allows Burma to secede from the Empire and become independent, it is a real question whether Burma is willing to do so for its own benefit. Although the future status of Burma still depends on the convening of the National Assembly, the existing signs seem to indicate one fact, that is, Burma may still obtain a dominion status within the British Empire like Canada and Australia, because this seems to be the most beneficial for Burma. The British Empire is essentially a "co-prosperity sphere." For its own benefit, Burma seems unlikely to leave it and become independent.</p>
<p>The resolution of the Burmese problem makes us think of the situation in Vietnam. Since the outbreak of armed conflict in the Hanoi-North Border area, the French government has adopted a hard-line policy in dealing with the Vietnam issue, implementing high-pressure tactics. The style of the Governor-General of Vietnam fully embodies the face of early imperialists. It should be known that the growth and development of national movements may sometimes be frustrated by external forces, but no nation can rule another nation by force for a long time. This is bound to fail sooner or later. Recently, there have been changes in the French government. We hope that they can adopt a more enlightened policy in dealing with the Vietnam issue, so that the wishes of the Vietnamese people can also be satisfied, and the lasting peace of the Far East can be maintained.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparations Materials All to Be Transported by Us Awaiting Approval from the US Secretary of State Before Shipment Can Begin</h3>
<p>Talks with Gong Xuesui</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Gong Xuesui, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee, said on the morning of the 29th: The more than 500,000 tons of materials Japan is paying as reparations to our country can be shipped to China after approval by US Secretary of State Marshall. These materials will be transported by our own ships. One-third will be transported by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the rest will be the responsibility of other shipping companies. It is estimated that it will take two months to complete the transport. The handling of these materials will not involve the establishment of any new institutions but will be managed separately by the receiving agencies. Gong believes that the resolution of the entire Japanese reparations issue will not be delayed for too long. He believes that after the closing of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the European issue will come to an end, and the various countries will discuss Far Eastern affairs. The reparations issue will naturally be raised at that time, and we will present our views on the entire reparations issue. The number of materials that the Soviet Union transported from the Northeast is currently being incompletely investigated by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau and will also be raised in the future. In addition, the five-member delegation assigned by our country to handle the reparations issue has been formed from five personnel originally in Japan. The delegation will be responsible for liaising with the Allied General Headquarters and other agencies, with a term of two years. The Philippines also has a five-member delegation going to Japan. As for when Gong himself will go to Japan, it will depend on when the taking over of Dalian will occur.</p>
<h3>World YWCA Conference to Be Held in Hangzhou in October</h3>

However, the representatives from the Soviet Union and India were absent. The Soviet side was represented by observer Rhodesky. The representatives from the Philippines and Canada were attending for the first time.</p>
<p>The meeting concluded at 4:00 PM. The next meeting has not yet been scheduled, but it will likely be in about a month.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of funding for UNRRA's relief work in China, according to Vice-Director Li Zhuomin of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), the Chinese government will allocate 160 billion yuan for UNRRA's expenses, of which 3 billion will be for the use of UNRRA's offices in China, 100 billion for the distribution and supply of materials, and 30 billion for other special purposes. In addition, another 800 billion will be allocated for the work expenses of domestic agencies using UNRRA materials and equipment.</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Countries Concerned About Relief in the Yellow River Flood Area</p>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, representatives from various countries were extremely concerned about the relief and supply of materials in the Yellow River flood area and the Communist-controlled areas of China. Xiang Jingyun, Director of the Investigation Department of CRRRA, Ling Daoyang, Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation and Relief Subcommittee, and Green, Director of the Agricultural Relief Group, successively reported on the flood situation and relief efforts in the area. According to Green, more than 2.3 million mu of land in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have been affected by the floods, affecting a total of 36 counties. The group has (1) an agriculture and immigration subcommittee, (2) an industry and transportation subcommittee, (3) a social and economic subcommittee, and (4) a public health subcommittee engaged in work. The main goal at present is to restore cultivation to such a large area of fertile land as quickly as possible. The important steps are: (1) Clearing accumulated water and tidying up farmland; (2) Massively searching for and transporting seeds, with an estimated 77,000 tons of seeds needed this spring; (3) Food for farmers must be prepared and supplied, as well as other necessities such as housing and medicines.</p>
<p>Jacques Sabben, head of UNRRA's Repatriation Group, reported on the repatriation of refugees from various countries. Regarding the repatriation of Chinese refugees, he briefly stated that 6,944 refugees had been repatriated to their original places of origin in the islands of Southeast Asia last year, and the total number as of the end of January this year was 8,700. In addition, 577 overseas Chinese were repatriated from Italy, and 803 were repatriated from New Guinea. Adding the refugees repatriated from the Philippines, the total was 6,471 people. In December of this year, due to the war, it may be possible to send back another 300 people from Annam, bringing the total number of repatriations to around 16,000. UNRRA has already allocated US$64 million for the repatriation of Chinese refugees, but refugees in shelters often have to wait a long time for their passports to leave the country, so this expenditure is a major burden for UNRRA. It is hoped that all parties will provide more assistance.</p>
<p>Principles Determined for Handling UNRRA's Unfinished Work</p>
<p>During the meeting, representatives had lively discussions on issues such as funding measures, engineering plans, and the distribution of transportation equipment. Regarding how to handle UNRRA's unfinished work after its conclusion in the future, the representatives also decided on two principles based on the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly: (1) The UNRRA Far East Regional Conference is willing to follow the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly and continue to handle social welfare work after the conclusion of UNRRA under the support of the United Nations. (2) The Social Group will pay special attention to this welfare work and, if requested by the countries of the Far East, will organize special committees to handle it.</p>
<p>The Philippine representative proposed a motion requesting UNRRA to allocate additional funds in addition to the 11.2 billion emergency relief funds, with the aim not to request the supply of food or materials, but to assist in the restoration and construction of Philippine agriculture, which would not only provide relief to the country but also help the people of other countries. As a result, the motion was passed.</p>
<h3>UNRRA's Medical Supplies to China - Proposal to Reduce Withdrawn</h3>

This year, UNRRA will transport medical supplies worth US$41,300,000 to China. For medical supplies that are not urgently needed or do not suit China, Liu suggested purchasing substitutes. All the goods have now been properly ordered by UNRRA and will soon be shipped to China in a steady stream."

<h3>Sichuan's Conscription and Grain Levy to be Completed by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chengdu] The total number of conscripts for the 35th year in Sichuan Province is 60,200, which was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of last year. However, due to imperfect personnel arrangements and insufficient preparation, the Ministry of National Defense has approved an extension to the end of this month. The cities and counties are now stepping up the collection work. The provincial government has also approved Chengdu and other cities and counties with special circumstances to recruit volunteers to meet the quota first. However, it is limited to those aged 20 to 25 who meet the physical standards for new recruits. Strict prevention should be taken to prevent local ruffians from profiting from it and criminals from escaping punishment by volunteering. If necessary, unemployed and displaced youth and refugees may be used to supplement the quota. The total amount of grain and food levy for the 35th year in Sichuan Province is 9 million shi. Under the same circumstances, the deadline for collection was extended from the end of last year to this month. Currently, more than two-thirds of the counties and cities in Sichuan have completed the collection.</p>
<h3>Differing Opinions on Establishing a City in Ningbo: Three City Area Maps Drafted</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 29th] Ningbo is located at the mouth of the Zhejiang Sea and is a well-known trading port in China. The issue of establishing a city is of great concern to all parties. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs previously sent Chen Zongen to survey and map the city area for submission to the Executive Yuan. According to Chen, he visited local people and solicited opinions. Older gentry oppose the establishment of a city at present. They claimed that the financial situation of Yin County before the war was indeed conducive to expanding the establishment of a city, and that a city should be established in the future, but at present, with the depression of industry and commerce, the economic conditions do not allow the establishment of a city. The county council still hopes to establish a city as soon as possible. As for the scope of the city area, there are three opinions: one is to establish a city according to the old map, the second is to expand the city area, and the third is to abolish Yin County and assign the three western districts to Siming County and the three eastern districts to Zhenhai County, so that the city area will be wide, close to the original Yin County territory. Chen has drawn maps separately and submitted them to Chairman Shen for approval.</p>

<h3>Good News for Civil Servants in Anhui Province: Central Government Agrees to Assist with Salary Supplements</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hefei] The central government has clearly ordered that the salary supplements for public education personnel in this province be adjusted from December of the 35th year, with the salary increased to 950 times and the living allowance to 140,000 yuan. However, the budget for revenue and expenditure in this province for the 36th year is already short by 25.8 billion yuan. With the adjustment, the shortfall reaches 31.01263 billion yuan, making implementation very difficult.

<h3>US State Department's Foreign Policy: Congress Decides to Conduct a Comprehensive Review, Thoroughly Adjust Internal Personnel, and Establish a Strong Lineup; Marshall Invited to Provide Necessary Information</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today decided to thoroughly study the State Department's policies towards various countries and international organizations. The Foreign Affairs Committee drafted a supervisory method sufficient to influence the State Department's organization, personnel, and policies. Former Chairman, Democratic Congressman Bloom, expressed considerable opposition during the discussion, but the committee unanimously passed the recommendation and expressed its willingness to assist in the revision and implementation of the bipartisan foreign policy of the United States. The committee also assured that it would cooperate fully with Truman and Marshall in carrying out their foreign affairs duties. Marshall has been invited to provide all necessary information during the committee's research, and the committee has also agreed not to disclose this information. According to sources close to the committee, the main purpose of this decision is to give Marshall the best opportunity to quietly eliminate the communist elements and old personnel in the State Department and to continue to show the world that the United States' foreign policy still has a unified front.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The House Committee's review of foreign policy is unprecedented in the United States in recent years.

<h3>British Cabinet Meeting Reviews Treaty Revision Proposal: TASS Attacks British Policy Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The British government held a cabinet meeting here today. It is reported that the cabinet members discussed Stalin's proposal to revise the Anglo-Soviet Agreement. It is reported that Foreign Minister Bevin met with Soviet Ambassador Zarubin yesterday for concrete discussions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Moscow Radio today re-broadcast a TASS commentary on Britain's policy towards the Soviet Union, stating that Britain's policy towards the Soviet Union cannot be said to conform to the principles and needs of the Anglo-Soviet Alliance.

<h3>US Government Condemns Poland, Believes Elections Did Not Meet Principles of Freedom, Declares No Immediate Intention to Sever Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 28th] The State Department today issued a statement formally condemning the Polish Provisional Government for employing widespread oppression and intimidation against democratic elements in the recent general election, failing to uphold its sacred promise to hold free elections.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 28th] The United States today declared that it does not recognize the Polish parliamentary elections of the 19th of this month, censuring the government's improper conduct. However, the US envoy in Warsaw will remain in place. In other words, the US will not sever relations with Poland immediately, but retains full freedom of action to determine its future attitude towards the Polish government. There is currently no indication as to what measures the US will take, but economic measures or even recalling US Ambassador Lane are possible. Lane could be recalled home for "consultations" without formally severing diplomatic relations. The aforementioned statement, approved by Secretary of State Marshall, was issued by the State Department and is the first major announcement of US policy towards Europe since Marshall took office, aligning completely with the declaration of former Secretary of State Byrnes regarding Poland. The US objections are based on the Polish government's suppression of democratic elements during the elections. It is claimed that "the Polish Provisional Government's oppressive measures are not limited to so-called 'underground elements,' but are a large-scale intimidation of democratic elements. Although these democratic elements do not belong to the ruling party, they are truly loyal to Poland." Therefore, the US government believes that the Yalta and Potsdam agreements' guarantees of free elections in Poland have not been fulfilled. The United States established diplomatic relations with the Polish government because of these two agreements.</p>

<p>[Associated Press London, 29th] Regarding the Burmese independence case, the British government today published a White Paper detailing the contents of the agreement reached in the negotiations between the British and Burmese delegations here over the past two weeks, stipulating that (1) Burma shall determine for itself whether to remain within the British Commonwealth with dominion status or to secede completely and become fully independent. (2) Burma shall elect a National Assembly in April to draft a constitution. The representatives of the National Assembly shall be entirely Burmese. (3) Before the new constitution comes into effect, Burma shall form a provisional government, with an Executive Council composed of Burmese people, and a Governor appointed by the British, similar to the situation in India. (4) It is recognized in principle that Burma may manage its finances during the transition period and may immediately command all Burmese troops.

<h3>US Army Secretary Pleads Urgently, Military Spending Cannot Be Cut, Strongly Advocates Extending Conscription Term</h3>
<p>[United Press Wyoming, 28th] Army Secretary Patterson warned here today that further reductions in the US Army budget would render us unable to carry out the tasks entrusted to us by the people. He said that the nation's overall military budget of $67 billion has already been greatly reduced, and the regular army will be reduced to one million and seventy thousand men by July 1, which is the absolute minimum limit. Patterson stated that the United States has ten regular army divisions, eight of which are currently stationed abroad. He also revealed that the Army Department will submit a recommendation to Congress within ten days to decide whether to extend the Selective Service Act, which expires on March 31. The number of new recruits this month is better, but still has not reached the minimum limit of 35,000 per month.</p>
<h3>Many Burmese Demands Not Fulfilled</h3>
<p>Opinions of Two Burmese Representatives</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 29th] U Soe, a member of the Burmese Administrative Council, and one of the two who do not approve of the agreement reached between the Burmese leaders and the British government, told a Reuters reporter that most of the demands that the Burmese delegation made to the British government were not fully met. U Soe said, "We came here to discuss the issue of Burmese freedom with the British government. After we arrived, we unanimously put forward several demands in the name of the entire delegation. These demands were determined according to the wishes of the Burmese people, and all representatives agreed, including (1) granting Burma independence within one year, (2) establishing a constituent assembly through direct elections, (3) establishing a provisional government with full cabinet powers, (4) transferring defense and foreign affairs powers to Burmese cabinet members, (5) financial autonomy. In addition, there are several minor demands. Except for using the 1935 mechanism for direct elections to form the constituent assembly, none of the other demands were fully approved by the British government. The issue of independence within one year was completely dismissed. Everything decided by the constituent assembly must be approved by the British Parliament. The current lack of any legislative power over defense and foreign affairs, and the fact that the freedom to be granted to Burma is equivalent to that granted to India, makes me feel that what the Burmese people wanted to gain from the conference has become a pipe dream. This is why I am unwilling to sign the agreement." Another person who does not approve of the agreement is Burmese Transportation and Communications Commissioner Sein. It is said that everything stipulated in the agreement is quite different from the original demands and greatly disappoints the Burmese people. Therefore, he is unwilling to sign the agreement. The constituent assembly is the most important of all the demands, but the constituent assembly does not have the final power to decide on a constitution that it deems suitable for Burma. This power is held by the British Parliament. How can this be called independence?</p>

<h3>Far East Tribunal Points Out That All Defendants Are Guilty, Tojo's Defense is Not Worth a Laugh</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha Tokyo, 29th] The defense attorneys for the defendants at the Far East International Tribunal today summarized the following points to defend the criminals: (1) This war was a war for Japan to defend itself and did not violate the Paris Peace Conference, the Treaty of Versailles, or other international treaties. The evidence presented by the prosecutors makes one feel that all the defendants are guilty, and at the same time makes one feel that they are all innocent; (2) Regarding the crime of disrupting peace, the prosecutors failed to provide evidence to prove that Japan's military actions were planned and prepared by the defendants or by a joint conspiracy; (3) Regarding the crime of murder, it has been proven that none of the defendants ordered the Japanese army to kill people; (4) Regarding ordinary crimes and crimes against humanity, the prosecutors failed to prove that the defendants individually or jointly had a direct relationship with the individual actions of the Japanese army that violated the regulations. The humanitarian responsibility for prisoners of war and detainees is the responsibility of the local military commanders.</p>
<p>Ten Major Crimes</p>
<p>The prosecutors refuted the above points, insisting that all the defendants bear criminal responsibility individually and collectively as follows: (1) All evidence and testimony clearly show that the common goal of the defendants was to control the "Greater East Asia" region, including wars of aggression; (2) Between 1928 and 1945, it is clear that some militarists and civilians in Japan jointly conspired. Okawa Shumei's "Construction of the Greater East Asia Order" clearly expresses this fact. The joint conspiracy eventually implemented the March Incident, the October Incident, and the Shenyang Incident. Defendants Okawa, Hashimoto, Itagaki, and Doihara all participated in these events; (3) Regarding the Shenyang Incident, the then-South Manchuria Railway Minister and his successor Araki and others prepared to invade "Manchuria" and establish a puppet regime; (4) The defendants strengthened their alliance with Germany and invaded China; (5) The situation of the invasion of China after the July 7th Incident was an attempt to annihilate, kill, and subjugate the Chinese army. Then-Prime Minister Hiranuma affirmed this policy, and according to the policy proposed by Hoshino, Japan would utilize the resources of China and all of East Asia. Furthermore, puppet regimes were established in Nanjing and Beiping, violating the Nine-Power Treaty, etc.; (6) Japan's policy was not only to build a "New Order in East Asia" but also to expel the British and Americans from China. Matsui, Hashimoto, Matsuoka, and Koiso said that driving out all the British and Americans was their ultimate goal; (7) Regarding Japanese-German relations, the military alliance, the Anti-Comintern Pact, and attempts to invade the South Seas and other places were closely coordinated by the three military, naval, and foreign ministries, stipulating the spheres of influence of Japan and Germany, and forcing the Yonai Cabinet to resign, to be replaced by Konoe, Matsuoka, Tojo, Hiranuma, Oshima, Shiratori, etc.; (8) Thus, the three-nation military alliance sought to dominate the world; (9) There is sufficient evidence to prove that the joint conspiracy decided on the Soviet-Japanese war. Although the southward advance was later implemented, this did not mean abandoning the attack on the Soviet Union; (10) Japan, in order to dominate East Asia, withdrew from the League of Nations, expanded its land, sea, and air forces, and transformed the mandated territories into fortresses. The attacks on Pearl Harbor and Hong Kong were not the climax of the joint conspiracy. The attacks on Britain and the United States were merely a means to dominate all of East Asia. This is the final goal of the joint conspiracy's internal and external activities.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 29th] At the opening of the Far East Military Tribunal today, Tojo's American defense attorney, Blewett, read Tojo's motion, denying war responsibility and wrongdoing, and stating that "the Greater East Asia War was not a war of aggression." Tojo showed no emotion when the motion was read.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Poses Twelve Questions; Stalin's Answers</h3>
<p>The American magazine "Look" published an article by Elliot Roosevelt, including an interview with Stalin on December 21, 1946, which contained Stalin's answers to twelve questions posed by Elliot Roosevelt. The questions posed by Roosevelt and Stalin's full answers are as follows:</p>
<p>Question 1: "Do you believe that a democratic system of government like that of the United States and a communist system like that of the Soviet Union can coexist in this world without either side attempting to interfere in the domestic political affairs of the other?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "Yes, of course I believe so. This is not only possible, it is wise and entirely within the realm of reality. In the most strenuous and tense times, during the war, differences in political systems did not prevent our two countries from uniting to eliminate our enemies. In peacetime, it is even more possible to continue this relationship."</p>
<p>Question 2: "Do you believe that the success of the United Nations depends on the agreement between the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States on basic policies and objectives?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "Yes, I think so. In many ways, the fate of the United Nations as an institution depends on the harmony and concord reached by these three powers."</p>
<p>Question 3: "Marshal, do you believe that a broader economic agreement between our two countries for the exchange of manufactured goods and raw materials would be an important step towards world peace?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "Yes, I believe it is important for establishing world peace. I certainly agree. The expansion of world trade would in many ways benefit the development of good relations between our two countries."</p>
<p>Question 4: "Does the Soviet Union support the immediate establishment by the United Nations Security Council of an international police force composed of all United Nations member states, so that it can immediately move into any place where armed conflict threatens peace?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "Of course, I support it."</p>
<p>Question 5: "If you believe that atomic bombs should be controlled by the United Nations, should the United Nations also control, through supervision, all research and manufacturing facilities related to armaments of any kind, and control the use and development of atomic energy during peacetime?" (At this point, Elliot Roosevelt interjected, saying: "Stalin asked a shrewd question: 'In general?' I said, 'Yes, but especially in regards to Russia's agreement in principle to this plan.'"</p>
<p>Stalin: "Of course, I believe so. Based on the principle of equality, there should be no exceptions made for Russia. Russia should abide by the same rules of supervision and control that any other country must abide by." (Elliot Roosevelt interjected again here, saying: "His answer was unequivocal, and the issue of reserving veto power was not even mentioned.")</p>
<p>Question 6: "Do you think that holding another tripartite conference to discuss all international issues currently threatening world peace would contribute to a beneficial goal?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "I think there should not be just one conference, but several. If there are several conferences, it will contribute to a beneficial goal." (Here, Elliot Roosevelt added: "At this point, my wife asked him if he thought such a conference would help government officials at lower levels achieve closer relationships. She also asked if wartime conferences had achieved such results. He smiled at her and replied, 'There is no question about it. Wartime conferences and the results achieved have greatly helped cooperation at lower levels.'")</p>
<p>Question 7: "Sir, I know that you are a scholar well-versed in the many other political and social issues existing in other countries. So I would ask: Do you not feel that the American elections in November indicate that the people have wavered in their faith in the policies of the late Roosevelt and are leaning towards the isolationist policies of the late Roosevelt's political opponents?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "I am not very familiar with the domestic life of the American people, but I think that the election indicates that the current American government is wasting the moral and political capital created by the late President, thus making it easy for the Republicans to win." (Here, Elliot Roosevelt added: "The Marshal spoke with great emphasis when answering my next question.")</p>
<p>Question 8: "To what do you attribute the reduction in friendly relations and understanding between our two countries since Roosevelt's death?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "I feel that if this question refers to the relationship and understanding between the American and Russian people, then there has been no deterioration. On the contrary, the relationship has improved. As for the relationship between the two governments, there have been misunderstandings, and there has been some deterioration. Later, there were many cries saying that this relationship would deteriorate further. However, in terms of the meaning of disrupting peace or military conflict, I do not see anything terrible in this regard. No great power is currently able to drive its army to fight against another allied power, against another great power, even if its government wants to do so, it will definitely not be able to, because in the current situation, a country cannot fight without the participation of the people—and the people do not want to fight. They are all tired of war. Moreover, there is no understandable goal to justify a new war. People will not know why they are fighting. Therefore, regarding the fact that some representatives of the American government are talking about the deterioration of relations between us, I don't see anything terrible. Given all these considerations, I do not think the danger of a new war is real."</p>
<p>Question 9: "Do you support the extensive exchange of cultural and scientific knowledge between our two countries? And do you also support the exchange of students, artists, scientists, and professors?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "Of course, I support it."</p>
<p>Question 10: "Should the United States and the Soviet Union formulate a common long-term policy of aid to the peoples of the Far East?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "I think that if this is possible, it would be useful. In any case, our government is prepared to pursue a policy in the Far East that is in common with the United States."</p>
<p>Question 11: "If the United States and the Soviet Union agreed on a system of loans and credit extensions, would such an agreement be permanently beneficial to the American economy?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "Such a system of credit extensions would certainly be mutually beneficial to both the United States and the Soviet Union." (Here, Elliot Roosevelt interjected: "Then I asked a question that was obviously related to many European countries.")</p>
<p>Question 12: "Does the Soviet government have significant reason to be surprised that the work of purging Nazis has not been thoroughly carried out in the American and British occupation zones of Germany?"</p>
<p>Stalin: "No, this is not a reason for great surprise, but the Soviet Union is certainly unhappy that this part of our common program has not been thoroughly carried out." (Reuters Moscow Dispatch)</p>
<h3>International Food Committee</h3>
<p>Decides on Rice Quota for the First Half of the Year</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 28th] According to Xiao Songqin, my representative to the Siamese Rice Joint Committee, the International Food Relief Committee recently allocated a total of 240,000 tons of rice to China for use in the first half of this year. Of this amount, Siam and Burma are each responsible for delivering 100,000 tons, with the remainder to be borne by Vietnam and other regions. The amount of rice China will receive from Siam in the first three months of this year is estimated at 11,511 tons for January and February and 13,389 tons for March. Siam's reserves of old rice are exhausted, so the initial export volume is not high. The above estimates are based on the harvest of new rice and factory output. Although Siamese government officials are optimistic about future food exports due to the autumn harvest, local transportation experts are deeply skeptical, as the current transportation efficiency in Siam is much lower than before the war.</p>

<h3>Yoshida Cabinet on the Verge of Collapse; Socialist Party Does Not Accept Yoshida's Conditions; Forming a Coalition Cabinet Still Faces Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 29th] Leaders of the Japanese Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties, Yoshida, Shidehara, and Katayama, held talks this morning to discuss the formation of a coalition cabinet. Yoshida stated that in order to overcome the national crisis, he was willing to resign en masse and form a coalition cabinet to overcome the major difficulties. Katayama stated that from a national standpoint, he had fully considered cooperating in forming a coalition cabinet, but the negotiation must be joined by the three opposition parties, the Ishibashi financial policy must be changed, and the Socialist Party members in the cabinet must be determined by the Socialist Party itself. Yoshida asked the Socialist Party to accept four cabinet seats, hoping to form a coalition cabinet on a fair and equal footing among the parties. However, there are legal difficulties regarding the entry of the Kyodo People's Party into the cabinet. Regarding the Ishibashi financial policy, he is willing to give it full consideration. As a result, today's talks did not reach a consensus. Katayama will convene the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party to decide on the final attitude. As for the Liberal Party, it held a meeting of its members in Tokyo this afternoon, resolving to absolutely oppose replacing Finance Minister Ishibashi. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether the Yoshida Cabinet will carry out a general resignation today. However, Yoshida himself seems determined to promote this move. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Joji visited the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives this morning to discuss the procedures for recommending the Prime Minister to the Emperor when a coalition government is established.</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 29th] The Japanese Socialist Party convened an emergency Central Executive Committee this afternoon to review the conditions proposed by Prime Minister Yoshida during the three-party leaders' talks this morning. The resolution was: (1) To not accept the conditions proposed by Yoshida; (2) The Yoshida Cabinet must first resign en masse, and then the five parties will negotiate the issue of a coalition cabinet. The Ishibashi financial policy must be abandoned, and both the Kyodo People's Party and the People's Cooperative Party must enter the cabinet. The above three points are absolutely non-negotiable.</p>

<h3>Five-Person Investigation Committee; Conducts On-Site Investigation of the Fire Zone; Based on Testimony of Disaster Victims; Two Firefighters Detained; Eyewitness Account of a Child Who Saw Looting During the Fire; Speaker Pan States That Witnesses Must Be Protected</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The five-person investigation committee for the Westmore Road fire case began its investigation work yesterday. Municipal Counselor Ge Kexin, Police Bureau Chief Inspector Zhang Da, Municipal Councilors Zhang Jiu Zuo, Jiangning District Chief Hou Junren, Supervisory Envoy Zhang Li-san, Public Works Bureau Survey Specialists Song Xueqin and Li Zhenqiu, victim Zheng Zaijian, and more than ten reporters from various newspapers arrived successively at the residence of Cai Guoliang, the Jiangning District Baochang at 350 Xikang Road, to gather and conduct the first detailed investigation of the disaster area. After interviewing the disaster victims, there was unanimous agreement on the dereliction of duty by the firefighters, and they all stated that it was true. However, it was still difficult to obtain concrete evidence of extortion and looting. However, in the answers of the victims, there were many clues to be found.</p>
<p>Also, when Speaker Pan arrived at Baochang Cai's residence at 4:45 PM, he repeatedly encouraged the victims to speak freely without reservation, saying that it concerned the welfare of all citizens and must be thoroughly investigated. The Municipal Council is a public opinion organ and must seek welfare for the citizens.</p>
<p>Chen Zhu Min, a tenant from house number 27 who was present yesterday, witnessed the looting behavior of firefighters 011 and 017. Speaker Pan said with emotion: This is good material and can be quickly reported to Mayor Wu and Director Xuan to discuss solutions. However, the municipal government must provide protection for such witnesses. The police bureau chief Zhang was responsible for handling this.</p>
<p>Ge Kexin, the chairman of the investigation committee, immediately telegraphed Mayor Wu, and the mayor ordered the two firefighters to be handed over to Chief Zhang for handling. Chief Zhang immediately notified the fire department to detain them. Firefighter 011 has now been detained, while 017 is a member of the Jing'an Temple District sub-team, and there has been no further information. It is reported that sub-team leader Li Xun has also been detained.</p>
<h3>Firefighters Appeared at the Window on the Third Floor; They Did Not Allow Residents to Enter</h3>
<p>The investigators first visited Shunkang South Goods and Seafood Store at 442 Wuding Road, which is located opposite the fire site. According to the shop owner Qiu Bingshun, the fire started at 9:30 PM on the first night of the new year at the home of a coppersmith at 425 Wuding Road. According to A Qian, the coal ball servant who first discovered the fire, it was caused by a short circuit in the electrical wiring. Qiu Bingshun called the fire department from the neighbor's phone within five minutes to report the fire. The first fire truck arrived 20 minutes later. At this time, the wooden shed of Wang Yunfu's house at number 29 had already caught fire. This wooden shed was the residence of the sixteen servants of the Wang family and was closer to the fire. However, it was extinguished in just over ten minutes. Therefore, when the later eight or nine fire trucks arrived one after another, the fire had actually been extinguished. However, half an hour later, the third floor of number 29 suddenly caught fire again. At this time, the American fire truck also arrived, but because they could not connect to the water dragon, they could not assist in the rescue. Seeing their situation, there seemed to have been a dispute. But when the American soldiers saw those firefighters spraying water on the glass windows of the Wang house, and it slid down the glass, they shot and broke the glass to let the water pour into the hole to irrigate the flames. Although the irrigation did not stop for half an hour, most of it was because it was poured on the lead roof, which could not suppress the fire. The wind was not strong that day, so number 29 burned for a full three hours before it spread to number 27. According to rumors, there were more than a hundred boxes of soft leather goods on the third floor of number 29. Some people saw firefighters appearing at the window on the third floor, but they did not allow residents to enter.</p>
<p>Having Wine and Chatting at the Water Boiler Stove; A Wine Bottle Was Left Behind</p>
<p>Qiu Bingshun also pointed out that the firefighters were careless and had wine and chatted at the nearby water boiler stove. So the investigation committee called Ren Huanting, the owner of Juxingyuan at 448 Wuding Road. The boss Ren said: At about 4:00 AM on the second morning of the new year, several firefighters ran in to ask for boiling water to drink, and they brought a bottle of foreign wine. They were leisurely and self-satisfied, and ordered the stove to be lit quickly to heat water for warming. The committee asked Mr. Ren if he had provided dishes. He angrily replied, "The house is on fire and you don't put it out, who would be happy to give them food!" After drinking wine, the firefighters left an empty bottle, which is now preserved by Chairman Ge. That is not a yellow wine or mung bean wine bottle, but a vintage foreign wine called Peppermint. The stopper fell into the bottle, probably for convenience when eating. We know that only wealthy families have this kind of vintage foreign wine. But so far, the owner of the wine has not been found.</p>
<p>More Than 2 Billion Worth of Hog Bristles; Even the Foreign House Was Burned Down</p>
<p>Then, the committee members went to the fire site for investigation. Unexpectedly, although number 29 was the first to be set on fire, it was more complete than other houses, both inside and out. The kitchen was not damaged, the stairs did not collapse, the green paint on the walls was still there, and a brand-new Santa Claus on the window was still there. A fire hose extended from the back door into the house and was burned and pressed in the rubble. It is worth noting that there are firewalls between each foreign house. Chief Zhang said, "With firewalls, the responsibility of the fire department is even greater."</p>
<p>It is said that when the fire broke out, the entire Wang Yunfu family, the manager of Sanyou Industrial Company, the owner of house number 29, was at the Majestic Theatre watching a movie. The maids saw the fire and were only anxious and panicked. Although they asked the firefighters for help, they were all maids and could not make any decisions. As a result, 400 boxes of hog bristles worth more than 2 billion yuan in the garden, and the magnificent foreign house were burned down.</p>
<p>Wardrobes and Shoe Boxes; A Big Hole Was Chopped</p>
<p>Number 11 is the home of Tang Ruichan, the assistant manager of Qingfeng Textile Co., Ltd., which is the owner who has been burned into ruins. In the rubble of his house, a jar of fragrant snails was seen, which was probably left over from the New Year. His old nanny, Wang Yingjuan, said that the fire burned to our house at 1:00 AM. But from 10:00 PM, the firefighters who came in and out had been constantly flowing. They did not allow us to move things, but they chopped a big hole in the wardrobes and shoe boxes in the downstairs room. The nanny wanted to go upstairs to grab things, but she was hugged and teased by the firefighters.</p>
<p>The Captain Came to Make a Phone Call; Subordinates Chatting and Asking for Tea and Cigarettes</p>
<p>When the inspection was completed, everyone went back to lunch to prepare to visit the disaster victims in the afternoon, the reporter visited a neighboring family again. According to them, from the time the fire broke out at night, the firefighters who came to borrow the phone were constantly flowing. These calls were probably made to the fire association, such as: "Why did we come from Jing'an District, but Xinzha District has not come yet?" "The fire truck has no gasoline, hurry up and bring some gasoline." "The time has passed, why don't you come to change shifts? Do you think we are easy to bully?" In addition, they also saw a captain come to make a phone call and say to the subordinates who were sitting in the house: Why don't you go to put out the fire? But the firefighters were still chatting and laughing, asking for cigarettes and tea, where did it look like they were putting out the fire?</p>
<h3>Famous Calligraphy and Paintings of Tang and Zhu; All Turned to Ashes</h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, many victims were summoned by the Baochang to his home to meet with the investigation committee. The anger of the explosion made them no longer as weak as lambs. They spoke outrightly and exposed without selfishness.</p>
<p>The first to speak was Gu Ze-zhi from number 11. His house was next to the Westmore Road Elementary School. When the coppersmith's house caught fire, he moved his things out, but because the fire was extinguished, he moved them back in again. When the fire became vigorous again, the house was full of smoke and stench, and it was impossible to enter again, so he had to watch it burn. He asked a firefighter for help, but the fire hose that was being used was full of holes, and water was splashing everywhere. In addition to being drenched in water from the cracks in the hose, it was useless. So, he watched as his precious ancestral calligraphy and paintings of Tang Bohu, Zhu Zhi-shan, etc., were all turned to ashes. Then, he shook his head and sighed endlessly.</p>

<h3>Watching the Municipal School Burn; Laughing and Saying the Mayor Has Money</h3>
<p>Gu specially pointed out the absurd actions of the firefighters at that time. When he discovered that the National Elementary School was burning, he encouraged the firefighters and said, "This is a municipal elementary school, hurry up and save it"! Unexpectedly, the firefighters sneered and said, "Anyway, the mayor has money"! Then, naturally came a concrete answer of inaction. Finally, Mr. Gu added that he had heard this sentence with his own ears and could take full responsibility for it. In addition, he hopes that the municipal government will assist in two points: (1) The responsibility for the delay in this fire and the facts of robbery and extortion should be thoroughly investigated. (2) The large landlord published an advertisement today, notifying the second tenants to clear the fire site within ten days, so that the owner can build a fence and renovate, and the original lease of the tenant is declared invalid. The authorities should stop this act of taking advantage of the fire and maintain the right of the victims to lease a new house.</p>
<p>Firefighters Fought Each Other; Three or Four People Were Twisted Together</p>
<p>The victim at the fire site at 425 Ximolu Road said: When the fire broke out, I was playing cards at Gordon Road. Suddenly, the lights went out. At that time, I only thought that the light was broken and wanted to buy candles to continue the fun. Who knew that it was my own house that was on fire? When I rushed home, my wife was dragging the child out. When we put the child down and went in to grab the quilt, we were immediately blocked by the smoke and fire and could not get out. In a panic, we had to cut off the fence of the Wang family next door with a knife and escape from their backyard. Poor children were shivering in the heavy rain without even having time to put on their clothes. He also said: At around 1:00 AM, he saw firefighters fighting each other at the gate of Dakangli, and three people were twisted together. Later, after the persuasion of several other firefighters, they stopped. Those present at the scene were extremely angry. It was hateful that the firefighters watched the fire from the other side of the bank, and it was even more hateful to fight before the fire!</p>
<p>Asking Where First Upon Entry; Turning Away Upon Knowing It Was A School</p>
<p>Ms. Pan Wenzhen, the principal of the Westmore Road National Elementary School, was even more emotional. She said eloquently: When I discovered it, number 29 had just caught fire, and firefighters ran into the house one after another. I told them to quickly tear down the house and spray water, but they ignored it and only asked: "What place is this here?" When they were told it was a school, they immediately turned and left. After that, until it was burned down, I never saw a water dragon come in. The teachers in the school, Pan Tianmin and Zhan Chunnian, personally ran to number 29 to see the rescue situation, but they saw that the water dragon never faced upwards, and asked: There is a big fire on the third floor, why don't you spray upwards forever? The answer was very simple: There is no water, what do you know? In this way, by 11:00, the school had been burned. Until about 4:00 on the first day, the school was still in flames. The rooms in the front door had already been burned, and only the library in the back door had not been burned yet. The teachers and others begged the firefighters to quickly give assistance, but to no avail, saying that there was no "seedling" (dragon head).</p>
<p>Finally Taking Matters Into One's Own Hands; Only Then Was the Library Preserved</p>
<p>In this way, after entangled with them for more than two hours, seeing that the fire was about to burn to the library, they had to take matters into their own hands and pull up the water dragon that was thrown on the ground and sprayed it hard at the library, and as a result, it was finally preserved. Principal Pan said: It didn't take much time at all for the fire to be extinguished. Therefore, everyone in the school believed that if they had their own tools, the fire would not have burned the school! Finally, Principal Pan concluded that the firefighters did not ask me for gold bars, so I would not read about hearsay, but it is a fact that they did not put out the fire. Their attitude was leisurely and slow, as if the fire had nothing to do with them!</p>
<h3>Rubber Factory Owner Denies Bribery</h3>
<p>Tong Keqin, the owner of Yongqin Rubber Factory, vehemently denied that he had ever engaged in bribery. He said, "I can swear to heaven about this! At the time of the fire, he was not in the factory. He only got the news at twelve o'clock. He rushed back immediately, not even having time to put on his coat, and without even bringing money for transportation. When he arrived at the factory, the Wang family had already caught fire, and the rubber factory was also affected. He saw that there were belts in the factory, but they were not connected to nozzles, so they were useless. At that time, he saw a firefighter and asked him to get a nozzle, but he never returned. The fire in the factory was extinguished by his own brothers and three workers. The factory was equipped with more than a dozen fire extinguishers, all of which were used up. Then lead buckets were used to pour water, and the fire was finally extinguished. Tong said: I have also heard rumors that firefighters demand extortion money, so when I saw that the fire in my factory was extinguished, I quickly fled, so as not to be seen by them and invite trouble. This was about four or five o'clock in the morning."</p>
<h3>Attending the Police Affairs Committee to Fully Assist in the Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Police Affairs Committee of the Municipal Senate held its seventh meeting at the committee yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. The fire case on Seymour Road and Wuding Road in this city was specifically brought up for detailed discussion, and the following resolutions were made: (1) As this case is currently under investigation by this committee, please the colleagues of this committee assist in the investigation as much as possible through personal relationships. (2) Mr. Chen Tingrui sent a letter to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of this council, stating that the fire on Shaanxi North Road and Wuding Road lasted for as long as thirteen hours, suggesting that the central district fire brigade should be privately run, and it seems that this case can be discussed in the municipal meeting. Resolution: This case will be brought up for discussion at this council's reconvened general meeting, and Mr. Chen Tingrui will be asked to provide a specific plan for a privately run fire brigade, and colleagues of this committee will collect information for the general meeting to refer to.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Resigns as Senator, Xian Bingcheng Fills the Vacancy According to Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Municipal Senator Wang Xiaolai recently sent a letter to Chairman Pan of the council, requesting to resign from his position as a senator. The secretariat of the council has received an edict reply, reluctantly approving it, and according to law, alternate senator Xian Bingcheng will fill the vacancy. A letter has also been sent to the municipal government to forward it to the central government for approval.</p>
<h3>Two Prosecutors Re-examine the Scene, Summoning Bao and Jia Leaders and Other Witnesses; Ineffective Firefighting is Indeed a Fact; There is No Concrete Evidence of Extortion; A Maid from Wang Yunfu's Family States that the Fluorescent Lamp was Taken Away by a Firefighter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Shen Zusheng, the prosecutor from the District Procuratorate, went to the scene of the Seymour Road fire again yesterday morning with a clerk and a photographer to re-examine the scene and take photos. At the same time, he summoned Bao and Jia leaders and other witnesses on the spot to investigate the details of the firefighters' rescue efforts at the time. According to Bao leader Cai Guoliang, Jia leaders Sun Zhiping and Zhang Bingwen, etc., the firefighters' rescue efforts were indeed ineffective. As for the extortion of gold bars and taking advantage of the fire to loot, they are all rumors after the fact, and there is no concrete evidence to provide. Tong Xunde, the manager of Yongqin Rubber Factory, denied ever bribing firefighters. Tu Lianbao, a maid from Wang Yunfu's family, stated that a fluorescent lamp was indeed taken away by a firefighter. In addition, according to the report of Section Chief Wang of the Fire Department: The Fire Department has not received a fluorescent lamp. Prosecutor Shen believes that since the Wang family has proven that a fluorescent lamp was taken away, and the Fire Department has not received it, it is not difficult to imagine that it was taken away by someone taking advantage of the opportunity. From a legal standpoint, the criminal responsibility for looting a fluorescent lamp is the same as that for looting valuable property. In addition, Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang rushed to the scene of the fire at around 10:00 a.m. yesterday to personally inspect the scene and gave instructions to Prosecutor Shen, who was investigating on the scene.</p>
<h3>15,000 Households Apply to Install Telephones, But There is No New Equipment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Telephone Company previously ordered a large number of telephone equipment from the United States, Britain, France, and Belgium. Due to the shortage of raw materials such as lead, copper, and steel in various countries, only a small portion has been shipped to date, so the telephone supply situation in this city has not improved. At present, more than 15,000 households in this city have applied to install telephones, but except for some military and political-related agencies, they have not been approved. According to the person in charge of the company, if no new equipment arrives in Shanghai within one or two months, it will be impossible to install new telephones in the future.</p>

Unexpectedly, when flying over Changting and Xiamen, the weather suddenly changed, with thick fog and extreme cold. Although the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 16,000 feet, it was still unable to break through the clouds and proceed smoothly, so it had no choice but to return to Shanghai, arriving here at 2:30 p.m. Chen and others are scheduled to fly to Guangzhou again at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. If the weather is good, it is expected to arrive at 2:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Attending the International Labor Conference, Our Representative Returns Home to Shanghai, More Than 8,000 Members of Various Trade Unions Welcome Him; Liu Songshan Talks About the Main Points of the Conference Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Songshan, the labor representative of China who participated in the 29th International Labor Conference, and consultant Zhou Xuexiang, after the conference closed, set off from France on December 18 last year to return to China. At 1:00 p.m. yesterday, the French ship Zephyr arrived in Shanghai. More than 8,000 members of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions such as shipbuilding, rubber, cigarette, and postal services went to the China Merchants Bureau Wharf in Hongkou to welcome them. After the two disembarked, the sound of firecrackers was deafening. Two female representatives of the trade union stepped forward to present flowers. The two then took a car to the Federation of Trade Unions on Penglai Road to rest. It is reported that the Standing Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to hold a welcoming dinner for the two at the Fulai Hotel at 12:00 today. The entire Shanghai labor community is scheduled to hold a welcoming meeting at the Kangle Restaurant at 2:00 p.m. on the first day of next month, inviting the two to report on their attendance at the International Labor Conference. In addition to reporting to the Shanghai International Labor Office within a few days, Liu is also scheduled to go to Nanjing at the beginning of next month to report to the Ministry of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>According to Liu, the International Labor Conference, which lasted for three weeks, was held in Montreal, the commercial center of Canada, from September 19 last year. A total of 46 countries participated, with more than 400 representatives attending. The Chinese delegation consisted of 13 people, with Li Pingheng and Wu Xiufeng representing the government, Zhang Jianhui representing the capital side, and Liu representing the labor side. Liu continued to describe the significance of the conference and the main points of its proposals. Due to the two world wars in more than 30 years around the world, economic chaos affected political unrest. The conference focused on this point and strived to uphold justice and humanity in order to achieve a balanced development of the world economy. The main points of its proposals: (1) Revise the International Labor Charter, (2) Formulate new conventions based on and reviewing old ones, (3) Formulate measures to protect young workers and juvenile workers (i.e., child labor as we call it in China), (4) Formulate policies to improve the treatment of workers in colonies. Liu added that although China has no colonies, the lives of overseas Chinese workers in various countries should be improved, so he also agreed with this proposal.</p>
<p>After attending the International Labor Conference, Liu and Zhou Xuexiang also represented the construction and textile labor unions of China respectively on November 10 last year to attend the International Building and Textile Labor Representatives Conference held in Belgium. Liu finally expressed his feelings, saying that today's world has entered the atomic bomb era, and all aspects of our country feel inadequate. Both labor and capital should step up their efforts. The capital side should be humanitarian and pay attention to labor welfare, while the labor side should be self-sacrificing and self-regulating, and in line with national interests, coordination can be achieved and progress can be made. Any disputes should be avoided, which is unwise.</p>

<h3>Collision Case at Wusongkou, Both Sides Were at Fault, Both Captains Neglected Their Duties, District Procuratorate Filed a Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the collision between the Zhijiang Wheel and the Huatong Wheel, the captains of the Zhijiang Wheel, Xin Chengfang, and the captain of the Huatong Wheel, Zhang Jinsheng, were detained by the District Procuratorate after the incident, and Prosecutor Fang Zheng actively conducted the investigation. The investigation has now been completed and a public prosecution has been filed. The prosecutor believes that the defendants Qi Chengfang and Zhang Jinsheng are not only responsible for the affairs of the entire ship, but are also navigation and driving personnel. They should pay special attention to the matters that should be fulfilled in their duties in order to fulfill their responsibilities. But now they are negligent and neglect their due duties, causing collisions and capsizing, passengers to be drowned, and affecting navigation safety. Since both sides are at fault, they should be held equally responsible, and they have both violated Article 183, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law: "A person engaged in business who, due to negligence in business, capsizes or destroys a train, tram, or other water, land, or air public transport vessel, vehicle, or aircraft in which people are present shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for a term of not less than five years." Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law: "A person engaged in business who causes death to a person due to negligence in business shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years or detention, and may also be fined not more than 3,000 yuan." Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law: "A person who injures another person due to negligence in business shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than 1,000 yuan; if the injury is serious, the person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than three years, detention, or a fine of not more than 2,000 yuan" The crime is suspected and should be sentenced according to Article 55 of the same law: "A heavier sentence shall be imposed."</p>
<p>The indictment of Prosecutor Fang states: "When the Zhijiang Wheel capsized and sank, a passenger named Cai Zhilin was crushed to death while escaping, and seven other rescued passengers were injured." It also states: "It was found that the two wheels were approaching the stone ridge in Wusongkou. According to the Navigation Administration Bureau's research on the nautical charts at the time, the width of the navigation channel in that section was at least 800 feet. The left lane of the Huatong Wheel should have 300 to 400 feet, proving that the defendant Wei Fang did not comply with Article 25 of the regulations for avoiding ridges and sail to the right, but turned to the left to avoid the ridge. The route taken was incorrect. The defendant Zhang Jinsheng drove the Huatong Wheel, the iron barge and the two ships abreast also violated Article 15 of the Port Director's announcement. The navigation errors of both parties caused the accident. It is clear reason."</p>

<h3>Tossing Boxes and Overturning Baskets, Filling Pockets to the Brim; A Speech by a Representative of the Disaster Victims; Not Knowing What the World Has Come To</h3>
<p>Zhou Qifang, the representative of tenant Zhou Xiuzhen of Room 27, brought the greatest help to the investigation committee. Zhou Qifang looked like a boy who was not yet twenty years old, but his alertness and composure surpassed ordinary adults. He saw with his own eyes the firefighters tossing boxes and overturning baskets, filling their pockets to the brim. And he remembered their numbers clearly. He said very methodically: There were seven families living in Room 27. There were many people coming and going, so when they found out that the coppersmith had started the fire, they closed the back door and all people went in and out from the front door. Not long after, they heard that the fire had been extinguished. Everyone was relieved. Unexpectedly, not long after, the fire rekindled. At this time, firefighters came to break down the back door to borrow flashlights and shouted: "Everyone get out, open the windows, open the doors." Not long after, their three-story building was burned down.</p>
<p>Zhou Qifang left the fire scene at 1:30 a.m. and returned to visit the next morning. It is said that the fire had not been extinguished by 11:00 a.m. on the second day of the Lunar New Year. Zhou Qifang had a relative, Li Shengyun, who was a squad leader in the Central Fire Brigade. He climbed to the roof to check the situation the next morning and told him that the situation was still good after the fire, and many boxes were preserved. Before leaving, he told Zhou Qifang that the captain of the team taking over this time was called Li Xun, and he could try to salvage the boxes after the fire was extinguished. After Li left, Zhou Qifang tried to climb into the fire several times, but was stopped. At this time, four firefighters were standing at the second-floor window rummaging through things. Finally, he borrowed a ladder and climbed up secretly. When they found out, he answered that he had contacted squad leader Li Xun. At this time, the firefighters forced him to open the box, which contained half a dozen towels, four dozen handkerchiefs, and cotton shirts, etc., all of which were stuffed into their pockets. They said: "Towels are good, handkerchiefs are good, give them to us to use!" Except that Qi Hang clearly remembered that the numbers of two of the firefighters were 011 and 017, one was not clear, and one was wearing a flat-topped hat, and the clothes were different from ordinary clothes, and he seemed to be the captain.</p>
<h3>Drifting in the South China Sea for a Day and Night; Talking About the Experience After Returning from Adventure; A Passenger of the "Miss Luzon" Saved Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Guan Shengfu, a passenger who survived the crash of the Far Eastern Air Transport giant airliner "Miss Luzon" on the 11th when it caught fire and sank in the Philippine Sea after flying from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and who was responsible for handling the aftermath negotiations in the Philippines, arrived in Shanghai on the French postal ship Zephyr at 12:00 noon yesterday. According to his account, the four-engine giant aircraft he was on took off from Shanghai to Hong Kong at 7:30 a.m. on the 11th. At 12:30 p.m., he found that the weather in Hong Kong was not good and changed to fly to Guangzhou and Xiamen, but the conditions were the same. In the end, it was decided to fly to Manila. At 1:15 p.m., he found that one of the engines was on fire and emitting smoke. The fire was immediately extinguished, but the engine made strange noises and vibrated continuously. At this time, a beauty used difficult-to-understand English to instruct the passengers to "return to their seats, put on life jackets, and fasten the straps." In an instant, the giant aircraft plunged into the water. Fortunately, the Pacific door had been opened, and five rubber dinghies taken from the aircraft had floated to the side. Thirty passengers (including six British and twenty-four Chinese) died in the aircraft, and three sank after leaving the aircraft because they were unable to cling to the dinghies. The rest climbed onto the dinghies. At that time, the water was rapid and the waves were high, and the fuselage was heavy. The aircraft sank three minutes after falling into the water. The passengers who came out of the water were divided into five rubber dinghies and drifted with the water. By the time it was dark and the waves were high, everyone thought they were hopeless. By 6:00 a.m. the next morning, they saw a small island 15 miles away. They struggled to move forward for an hour, but they still could not make an inch of progress. As a result, they had to let it drift. At 10:30 a.m., they were discovered by five aircraft and looked for a ship to rescue them. At 11:50 a.m., they boarded the American ship General Collins. During these 22 hours, the dinghies were undulating and everyone was vomiting. The most painful thing was the lack of drinking water. Guan also reviewed the aircraft accident and expressed three points of feelings: (1) Philippine Airlines should be responsible, because the aircraft that departed this time had an engine that was not working, so one was replaced, and the engineers who performed the work were mostly unqualified. And this broken engine was still placed in the cabin, which only increased the weight. (2) There are no Chinese translators on foreign aircraft, and few of our Chinese passengers know English, so some did not put on life jackets or fasten the straps properly, and all were killed in the aircraft when they fell into the water. (3) After the British arrived in Manila, their embassy took good care of them, while our country's overseas authorities only sent personnel to express condolences the next day. Guan said that now, in addition to the impossibility of calculating the number of dead, the loss of luggage per person is between three and four thousand US dollars. He has hired lawyer Alexander to negotiate with the company authorities on behalf of all the passengers who encountered the danger.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Enemy Property Auctions is a Transitional Measure; Discussing New Methods for Collecting Usage Fees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the auction of enemy property real estate due to repeated disputes, President Song of the Executive Yuan has ordered the China Trust Bureau Enemy Property Clearance Office to temporarily suspend the auctions. The reporter visited the person in charge of the Enemy Property Office yesterday and was told that this is a transitional measure. Because it is difficult to move out of the houses after they are auctioned, the original residents will continue to use them during this transitional period. However, once the time is right, the enemy property real estate will still be auctioned.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Enemy Property Office said: The usage fees collected by the office for the enemy property houses it manages are not enough to pay the taxes of the Finance Bureau and the Land Administration Bureau. Therefore, it is currently discussing methods for collecting house usage fees with relevant parties, or it will collect usage fees of less than 8 per thousand per month based on the value of the real estate.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Guohua, traffic police officer No. 612 of the old Zha traffic police station on Jiujiang Road and Xizang Road, was surrounded by more than 30 soldiers from the Navy Training Camp at about 9:00 p.m. yesterday while he was on duty. They stabbed him in the head and neck with knives, and blood flowed like a river. The soldiers scattered when they saw that they had caused trouble, but the police officer captured one person while injured and brought him to the station for verification. Zhang Guohua was later sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the incident, Director Shi Sijian of the branch personally visited the injured police officer in the hospital. It is reported that the reason for the incident was that several sailors had a conflict with police officers at the Tiangong Skating Rink the night before, and the next night they gathered a crowd to retaliate.</p>

He went straight into the room, lay down on the bed, and wielded a meat knife. All the people in the house were shocked and reported to the Taishan Branch. After the police were dispatched, the sailor had already slipped away, leaving behind a white military cap, number A 485. The police station called the American military police team to send personnel to the station to take the military cap back and thoroughly investigate the American sailor who caused the trouble.</p>
<h3>Central China Aviation Shanghai-Chongqing Plane Crash: Discovery at Tianmen, Western Hubei. All Twenty-Six Passengers and Pilots Perished. Company Representatives Fly to Hankou to Supervise Handling of Aftermath.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 29th] China National Aviation Corporation reports: After the crash of Flight 145, Shanghai-Chongqing route, on the 28th, a special plane was dispatched from here at 6 a.m. this morning to search. The wreckage was found, burnt down, near Yonglong River in Tianmen County. Due to the lack of an airfield, landing was impossible. Another special plane was dispatched for inspection this afternoon. Huang Yiwei, Director of the Wuhan Office of the company, will lead doctors and nurses, carrying medicine, by automobile to provide emergency assistance tomorrow morning. Furthermore, according to a telegram received by the Hubei Provincial Government on the 29th from the Tianmen County Government: The plane crashed near Yuxin River within the county, immediately catching fire. The local town head led a team to extinguish the fire. Among the twenty-six people on board, except for one foreigner who was seriously injured and has been sent to the county town for treatment, all others perished.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] China National Aviation Corporation's C-47 model Flight 145, Shanghai-Chongqing route, departed from Shanghai for Chongqing on the 28th and went missing approximately thirty minutes from Hankou. Upon receiving the news, the company dispatched a plane yesterday to search from the air and at 9:15 a.m. it was discovered that the plane had crashed within Tianmen County, western Hubei, approximately one hundred kilometers from Hankou. It remains unknown as of last night whether all twenty-six pilots and passengers perished. The Hankou office of China National Aviation Corporation has organized a jeep team to rush to the scene to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Flight 145 departed from Shanghai at 7:20 a.m. on the 28th, piloted by Captain Babaji and Co-pilot Lu Wei (from Guangdong). The wireless telegraph operator was Qiu Yisheng and there were thirty-one passengers. At 10:40 a.m., it arrived in Hankou, where twelve Shanghai-Hankou passengers disembarked and four Hankou-Chongqing passengers boarded. Therefore, when continuing the flight from Hankou, there were a total of twenty-three passengers on board. Approximately half an hour after leaving Hankou, the plane lost contact with the ground.</p>
<p>Discovery After Search</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the head office in this city held an emergency meeting. General Manager Shen De and Chief Pilot McDonald, along with Secretary Wu Jingyan, traveled to Hankou on a scheduled flight early yesterday morning to supervise the search and handle the aftermath. At the same time, Pilot Lanbo was dispatched to fly Special Plane No. 123 to search from the air. Lanbo discovered the crash site at 9:15 a.m. From the air, it was seen that the plane had crashed onto a farmer's fence, with one wing detached from the fuselage and lying approximately half a mile away. Crowds were gathered around, presumably local villagers who had come to watch. After the plane was discovered, the company dispatched Plane No. 123 again at 4 p.m., carrying medicine to drop from the air at the scene, so that any injured survivors could be treated as soon as possible. At the same time, they attempted to communicate with the ground to inquire about the confirmed number of casualties and to investigate the situation at Zhongxiang Airport and Qianjiang Airport in the nearby Han River basin, intending to choose one for landing and to find ways to rescue.</p>
<p>The weather along the flight path of the ill-fated plane was not bad, and the crash site was also on a plain, so the cause of the accident has not yet been determined. It is generally speculated that it was due to a malfunction of the aircraft itself.</p>
<p>Passenger List</p>
<p>Among the twenty-three passengers, there were eleven foreigners (including five children and two women), all of whom were affiliated with the church. The twelve Chinese passengers included Min Tao Sheng, General Manager of Hua Wei Bank, and one woman. The full list is as follows:</p>

<h3>Jiang Shangda, Lying on a Rattan Chair in Court, Appears for Trial While Ill. Claims to Have Reported His Acceptance of a Puppet Position to the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Unification. Closing Arguments Concluded, Judgment Scheduled for the Fifth of Next Month.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Jiang Shangda, suspected of being a traitor, appeared for trial yesterday morning at the High Court, ailing and lying on a rattan chair with a cotton cushion underneath. Due to severe lung disease, he looked haggard with graying hair and a yellow-tinged beard. He wore a gray Russian-style hat pulled down low, only revealing his eyes and nose. He wore a blue silk-padded robe with a blue silk-faced black lambskin overcoat, tied-leg pants, black duck-tongue woolen shoes, and a light yellow woolen scarf. A light blue plaid woolen blanket covered him. A spittoon and a thermos were placed beside him, and a family member was taking care of him. He coughed, spat phlegm, took medicine, and drank water frequently, answering questions while lying down in an extremely weak voice, sometimes only nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>Jiang is a native of Wujin, 55 years old, and well-known in the textile industry. In March of the 31st year (of the Republic, i.e., 1942), he was appointed by the enemy as the Vice Chairman of the Shanghai-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Industry Association. In the same year, he also served as a member of the Puppet Cotton Industry Control Committee. In the 32nd year (1943), he served as a director of the Puppet Commerce Association. In the 33rd year (1944), when the enemy wanted to collect spindles to contribute iron, Jiang stepped forward to negotiate and signed an agreement with the enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Federation, under which the enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Federation supplied raw materials. The raw materials were entrusted to the association to allocate to colleagues to make cotton cloth, and the cotton cloth was sold at a discount to the enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Federation to stop the exchange of iron.</p>
<p>Jiang Shangda replied in a weak voice, stating: His appointment as Vice Chairman of the Puppet Shanghai-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Industry Association was due to the recommendation of his colleagues. His position as a director of the Puppet Commerce Association was forcefully appointed by the enemy. The situation was very complicated. He had always opposed the enemy's policy of buying up yarn and had consolidated the yarn factories in the market, moving them to the countryside, so that the enemy's policy of buying up yarn could not be implemented. Therefore, the Japanese side resented him and detained him in the Capital Hotel for three months. Regarding the Japanese's plan to collect spindles to contribute iron, the colleagues united to oppose it for the sake of survival, and ultimately the enemy's plan was thwarted, preserving more than two million spindles. As for the claim that he wove yarn for the enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Federation as an exchange condition, that does not correspond to the facts. He did not participate in the signing of the contract. His acceptance of a puppet position was secretly reported to the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Party Headquarters beforehand, and he was assigned by the bureau to serve as an intelligence officer in the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Group, which is documented, and so on.</p>
<p>Witness Han Zhicheng, manager of Guoxin Yarn Factory, testified: During the enemy puppet period, Jiang Shangda was extremely protective of yarn factories established by Chinese people and secretly instructed various yarn factories to consolidate and move to the countryside to sabotage the enemy's plan to buy up yarn and collect spindles to contribute iron. Afterwards, the defendant's lawyers, Zhou Yingcai and Li Mo, stood up to defend him.</p>
<p>At this point, Judge Liu declared: The arguments for this case are concluded, and the judgment will be announced on the morning of February 5th. Jiang Shangda was sent back to Cambridge Hospital to continue treatment, but he is not allowed to leave the hospital on his own. Then, two hospital workers carried the rattan chair into a car, which sped away.</p>
<h3>Sun Tianchang Planted Enemy Assets Case: Military Tribunal Investigates Yesterday.</h3>

<h3>Defu and Bayer Factories: Actively Preparing for Nationalization.</h3>
<p>Raw Materials to Be Purchased from Germany Through Barter.</p>
<p>The liquidation work of the German Overseas Property Liquidation Office has been nearly completed by the end of last year. The issue of how the Defu and Bayer factories will supply raw materials to the Chinese market in the future has aroused widespread concern. It is now known that the office is actively preparing to form the two factories into a state-owned joint-stock company, and the original machinery and raw materials of the Weixin Chemical Factory in Tianjin and Qingdao, both enemy assets, will be assigned to Defu for acquisition. The factory price concession for the Qingdao side, totaling 7 billion yuan, was concluded last week. The Tianjin side is under negotiation. Yesterday, the China Trust Bureau also purchased manufacturing raw materials from Germany through barter to facilitate production, and the surplus assets of the two companies will be used as a portion of the shareholders' equity. Once the supply of pigments and medicines returns to normal, all shares will be sold at market prices. Although the amount of fixed capital has not been determined at this time, the above organizational principles have recently been approved by the Executive Yuan, and it has been ordered that the China Trust Bureau, as a representative of the government, engage in operations.</p>
<h3>Puppet Finance Minister Zhang Deqin Dies in Prison Hospital.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Deqin, the puppet Finance Minister of Zhejiang Province, who had been sentenced to ten years in prison, died in the Shanghai Prison Hospital at 3:50 p.m. yesterday. His illnesses were diabetes and lung abscesses. When Zhang was critically ill, the prison authorities notified his family to visit him. The body was temporarily placed in the Shanghai Prison last night.</p>
<p>Zhang was a native of Baoshan, Jiangsu Province, and was 56 years old. He studied at Lincoln Jefferson University in the United States and obtained a doctorate in law. During the enemy puppet period, he served as a specialist in the Puppet Ministry of Social Welfare, a member of the Puppet Frontier Affairs Commission, the Puppet Finance Minister of Zhejiang Province, and the manager of the Insurance Department of the Puppet Central Trust Bureau.

<h3>Case of Enemy Property Encroachment on Dengtu Road: Jiang Customs Replies to the District Prosecutor's Office.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Regarding the case reported by Sun Zhuting and others concerning the encroachment of a large batch of enemy property worth over 1 billion yuan at No. 340 Dengtu Road in this city (details can be found in this newspaper on the 7th of this month), after the District Prosecutor's Office began its investigation, it involved Ding Guitang, the former Deputy Commissioner of the Maritime Customs and concurrent Commissioner of the Jiang Customs. Yesterday, Liu Bingyi, Commissioner of the Jiang Customs, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office, stating: On November 5, 34th year (1945), he was ordered to organize the "Office for the Reception of Enemy Puppet Wharf Warehouses," which was jointly managed by the Customs, the Third Theater of Operations, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Naval Headquarters, and the Bureau for the Handling of Enemy Puppet Property. It was also stated that the office was actually presided over by Ne Prou (American), the Standing Secretary, and Qian Zongqi and Guo Yourong, the Deputy Commissioners, and not directly by Ding Guitang. Moreover, Ding has now been transferred to the position of Deputy Commissioner of the General Customs Administration, and Ne Prou has also returned to his country. Therefore, when the District Prosecutor's Office has inquiries, Qian Zongqi, the Commissioner of the Secretarial Section of the current General Customs, and Han Zhaolian and Guo Yourong, the Deputy Commissioners, can come to answer questions. Finally, it was stated: However, these people are very busy with official duties, and it is requested that they be sent back immediately after the interrogation, and it is guaranteed that they can still be summoned at any time.</p>
<h3>Runway at Longhua Airport: Transporting Sand and Gravel in Preparation for Repair.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Since the repeated accidents involving civil aviation aircraft, various sectors have expressed many complaints about civil aviation equipment. The Ministry of Transportation has allocated 9 billion yuan to improve Longhua Airport and established the "Longhua Airport Repair Engineering Office," appointing Chen Zudong as the Director and Shi Yuze as the Deputy Director, responsible for repairing the north-south runways of the airport.</p>
<p>Longhua Airport originally had four runways, but due to financial constraints, only the most frequently used north-south runways can be repaired first, as the wind direction in this city is mostly south wind and north wind, and airplanes land against the wind.</p>
<p>According to the original plan, the north-south runways can be completed by the end of March. Currently, due to the slow transportation of materials, it is feared that completion will be delayed until mid-April.</p>
<p>The repair of the north-south runways at Longhua Airport is still in the preparation stage, and stones, yellow sand, and cement are constantly being transported. Because wooden boats are used for transportation, it takes a long time. Various repair tools, such as stone crushers, road graders, rollers, and cement mixers, are mostly leased from the Zhenru Mechanical Road Construction Team of the Highway Administration, and a portion is purchased from the "Executive Headquarters." However, all kinds of equipment are very heavy, and transportation is particularly difficult.</p>
<p>The entire repair project is contracted by Zhonglian, Tao Guiji, and Baohua Construction Companies.</p>
<p>The Longhua Airport north-south runway repair plan has a length of 6,000 feet and a width of 150 feet. On the left and right sides, shoulders of 25 feet will be added, and there will be drainage ditch equipment. Straight expansion joints are laid in the middle of the runway, with transverse expansion joints laid every 120 feet. The upper layer of the runway will be paved with 11.2-inch thick cement. After the completion of the runway repair, it can be used for the landing of airplanes weighing more than 40 tons. (Bottom picture: The situation of transporting sand and gravel at the airport)</p>
<h3>Female Knitwear Workers: Strike Over Year-End Bonus.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] There are approximately 2,000 to 3,000 female workers in the electrical machinery group of the knitwear industry in this city. At the end of last year, they requested a year-end bonus of 500,000 yuan per person. The employers stated that the business situation last year was not good and there was no precedent for this. After requesting mediation from the Social Affairs Bureau, it was ruled that it would be handled in accordance with the law and would not be issued. After the Lunar New Year, some factories resumed work a few days ago, but the workers immediately implemented a go-slow strike. The Social Affairs Bureau, believing that the labor union was unaware of this strike beforehand and fearing that someone was manipulating it from behind the scenes, summoned the responsible persons of the industrial labor union to the bureau yesterday afternoon and repeatedly emphasized their responsibilities. It is reported that the employers have agreed to a year-end bonus based on one dozen pairs of ordinary socks per person (approximately 20,000 to 30,000 yuan), but the labor side has not agreed and is demanding approximately 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Suspects in Street Vendor Incident: District Court Formally Rules for Dismissal of Charges.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] In the street vendor incident last year, Fang Daosheng and 46 others who were detained on charges of disrupting public order were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office after the investigation was concluded and transferred to the District Court for trial. The court opened on the sixth of this month. As the crimes of all the defendants fell under the amnesty provisions of the Great Amnesty Order, bail was granted and they were released in court. Yesterday, the District Court formally ruled on the case, dismissing the charges in accordance with Article 294, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. This sensational case has now come to a complete end.</p>
<h3>Participating in Public Utilities Committee Meeting: Discussing Street Vendor Locations and Electricity Conservation.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council held its eighth meeting yesterday, with Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, in attendance. Regarding the matter of how to select responsible personnel to survey and determine the location of street vendor stalls, it was decided to jointly select Yun Qing and Yan Guodong to handle the matter together with the police affairs group. Also, regarding the cancellation of electricity conservation, the Public Utilities Bureau requested that the point regarding electric cooking be retained and not canceled for the time being. It was resolved that the electric cooking portion would be allowed to be temporarily retained and not canceled.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Crisis Becomes More Serious: If High-Interest Loans, Etc. Are Not Resolved, Dismissals Are Bound to Occur.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that if problems such as high-interest loans, dumping of foreign goods, and transportation cannot be resolved, the economic crisis will become more serious. This year, there is a risk that the industrial and commercial sectors in this city will face a serious dismissal problem. Although dismissals are legal, an increase in the number of unemployed people will inevitably have a significant impact on social order. Therefore, he is deeply concerned about this issue. Since the industrial and commercial sectors are facing this crisis this year, employers should be enlightened, and workers should also use great patience to overcome this difficulty. At the same time, the government should do more to provide unemployment insurance, worker education, and other welfare work.</p>
<p>Director Zhao continued to review the work of the Labor Department over the past year, claiming that it only addressed the symptoms and did "firefighting" work passively. Treating the head when it hurts, and the foot when it hurts. The unemployment insurance and other matters that were originally planned could not be taken care of due to being busy with mediating labor-management disputes every day. He felt ashamed of this. However, he asked himself to do things with conscience, and the workers all regard me as a friend, not as an official, which is very comforting to myself.</p>
<p>Regarding Director Wu's resignation, Director Zhao said: He fully sympathized with him. Like someone who has been fighting on the battlefield for a long time, he should be transferred back to the rear to rest. Director Wu has been busy with affairs for the past year, and recently his brain nerves have been aching, extending to his neck, and he feels pain even when turning his head. This time, he submitted his resignation in order to rest. His intention to resign seems very firm.</p>

<h3>Social Services Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>(1) Abandoning the Old for the New</p>
<p>Lu Guiliang asked: After someone named Jia married Yi for more than a year, they began cohabiting with a woman named Bing. This has continued for four years, and they each have children. Now Jia sees Yi as a thorn in his side. There are several legal questions now, and I ask that you answer them. (1) Jia and Bing have already had children and everyone in the family knows about it. Does this constitute bigamy under the law? (2) Even though there is no written evidence, can the household registration form be used as evidence under the law? (3) If Yi divorces Jia, can she demand compensation for losses under the law? (4) If the daughter born to Yi is adopted by Yi, can she demand education and living expenses from Jia? (5) If Yi and Jia divorce based on a written agreement by relatives or close friends, is this legally effective?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin's Answer] (1) If Jia and Bing did not hold a formal wedding ceremony and are only cohabiting, then it is not bigamy. (2) As answered in the first question. (3) She can request compensation for damages. (4) According to the law, the children should be adopted by Jia, but if there is another agreement, that agreement shall prevail. (5) A consensual divorce should be in writing and should have the signatures of two or more witnesses.</p>
<p>(2) Forced Marriage</p>
<p>Wang Zhengqing asked: Someone named Jia was engaged to a woman named Yi at the age of sixteen, with his mother acting on his behalf based on the words of a matchmaker. Jia absolutely disagreed with this marriage. During the War of Resistance, the National Army moved west, and the public order in the countryside was quite chaotic. Yi's family asked Jia's family to take her back to avoid accidents. Jia's mother had no choice but to take the girl back and treat her as a child bride. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Jia was studying in Shanghai, and the family situation was not good. However, he heard rumors that Yi was not behaving properly in the countryside, but there was no evidence, and he also heard that Yi had contracted a venereal disease. The following year, Jia married Yi on his mother's orders, but his inner pain could not be described in words. Now Jia has another girlfriend, and the two have already become engaged. Therefore, Jia wants to divorce Yi. There are several questions, please provide guidance. (1) The combination of Jia and Yi was not in accordance with his own wishes and was completely forced. Is it legally valid? (2) Yi has suffered from venereal disease (suffered before marriage). Can Jia use this as a basis to sue for divorce?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin's Answer] (1) Marriage contracts should be entered into by the man and woman themselves, but marriage contracts entered into by parents on behalf of their children must have the consent of the child, otherwise they are invalid. Also, marriage cannot be forced to be performed. This is clearly stipulated in Articles 972 and 975 of the Civil Code. (2) Those who have suffered from a dishonorable disease can use it as a reason for divorce, but it is not a condition prescribed by law that constitutes divorce.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Continues to Face Pressure, "Boiled Red" Trend Remains Steady</h3>
<p>The "boiled red" [currency] market saw a slight stabilization in sentiment yesterday, but the Central Bank continued to face pressure. The morning opening ranged from 3.9 million to 3.92 million. After opening, there was a slight dip to 3.89 million. However, due to general anxieties about gold reserves and the suspension of gold sales by Mexican authorities, sentiment remained relatively stable. The Central Bank officially allocated 1,680 bars at a price of 3.9 million, which briefly boosted the price to 3.96 million. The Central Bank sold when the price rose, causing it to drop back to 3.905 million before stabilizing again. Around noon, the price hovered around 3.93 million. In the afternoon, the Central Bank released several hundred more bars for next-day settlement, resulting in minimal change in the market price. The final result was a slight increase compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were listed at 410,000. Silver dollars remained stable. Informal short-term lending rates eased slightly, with daily interest rates ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies remained quiet and stable. The informal market for U.S. dollars continued to hover between 6,700 and 6,900, though the buying and selling prices were close around noon. The market became even more stagnant in the afternoon, fluctuating between 6,800 and 6,900. The final result was a slight stabilization compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were similar, consistently struggling around 1,350 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose slightly to around 1,320 yuan, with limited transactions. The Indian exchange rate was 1,600 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 21,000 yuan, both with prices listed but no market.</p>
<p>Government bonds remained sluggish yesterday, with just over a million changing hands. Room 660 saw some purchases, while Room 604 saw slight sales. Unified bonds C opened in the morning at 1,980 yuan, with a high of 2,050 yuan, ultimately fluctuating between 2,020 and 2,040 yuan. The final result compared to the previous close was stable for bonds A, B, and C, while bonds D and E each rose by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Market Returns to Weakness; Oil, Soybeans, Sesame, and Flour Perform Well</h3>
<p>The amount of rice arriving from the source yesterday remained low, while destocking was active but not strong. A total of around 3,000 shi arrived in the northern and southern markets. The reason was that the weather was severely cold the previous day, and the rivers in the countryside were still not thawed, hindering the supply. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to supply Saigon rice, with only 130 packages sold. Retail stores were normal. Japonica and Indica rice prices were tight in the morning but weak in the afternoon, unable to rally, and ultimately trending towards weakness. In the oil market, soybean oil remained scarce, with limited trading for the time being. Unrefined oil outside the market rose informally by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Refined oil and sesame oil saw little movement. The intake of soybean cakes from Shantou and Taiwan showed signs of slowing, with only Xinghua seeing slight activity, with a price decrease of 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean oil factories had a strong appetite for raw soybeans, and local traders competed to buy them for transshipment, leading to a further increase of 500 to 1,000 yuan. Cowpeas and coral beans were selling well and dried quickly, leading to another increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red beans remained temporarily stable, and mung beans were similar. Sesame was stable. Raw kernels were selling well, and prices were gradually rising, reaching new highs and continuing to rise sharply by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans' arrivals could not keep up with demand, leading to a sharp increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Corn alcohol was in high demand, rising sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran also rose, increasing by 200 to 300 yuan, while small packages soared by 600 to 700 yuan. Flour from the mainland continued to rise gradually, with strong market sentiment, and prices soaring by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the Edible Oil Review Committee met to discuss adjusting oil prices and the allocation of oil from the China Planting Factory.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Markets are Both Firm; Fine Cloths are Lacking Except for "Five Blessings"</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn – Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw relatively healthy buying from outside traders. Local dyeing factories took advantage of the low prices to buy, as the Spring Festival had passed. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose gradually from 4.52 million to 4.58 million. 20-count and 16-count coarse yarn also rose from 20,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton – Yesterday, the spot cotton market saw Xin Xin Yarn Factory purchase over 50 dan of fine short-staple cotton, and private small factories transacted 200 bales of white cotton. Because the supply of spot goods was drying up, traders were generally optimistic.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth – Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw 12-pound colored ball Yang He cloth decline by 500 to 1,000 yuan per bolt due to the China Textile Construction Company's large sales of fine cloths. "Five Blessings" fine cloth was doing particularly well, with a shortage of chips, selling for an additional 1,000 yuan, while the rest were stable.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Orders Submission of Transaction Forms; Rayon Market Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Artificial Silk Industry Association received a notice from the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday, stating that every transaction of artificial silk must be written on a transaction form, which must include the name, address, purpose, and transaction price of the buyer and seller. According to rayon traders, rayon merchants have had no business since the China Trust Bureau took over unified management and distribution. All rayon firms have long been ordered to stop distribution by the China Trust Bureau, and the stocks from the enemy and puppet periods have gradually been sold out. Those who want to eke out a living can only make a small profit by manipulating the colors of the factories. Now that the Municipal Police Bureau has ordered the filling out of transaction forms, the "purpose" item cannot be filled out truthfully. Moreover, rayon transactions have been extremely rare recently, with only a few boxes changing hands each day. Under these circumstances, trading is temporarily suspended, and there was no rayon market today.</p>
<h3>China Textile Distributes Yarn, a Total of 819 Pieces</h3>

<h3>Limited Business for Woolen Cloth Ingots</h3>
<p>The retail cutting and Western clothing businesses in woolen cloth stores are currently stable. Recently, due to the Chinese New Year arriving early, the wholesale ingot business is limited because colleagues are swapping and trading amongst themselves due to the head lining and environmental situation, and indirect transactions with general brokers and street peddlers are also limited. Yesterday, only medium-thick broadcloth and melton from the US, and Zhanghua Australian wool tweed, etc., saw some actual transactions. Otherwise, there were few sales. Standard quotations at public tea meetings remained on the red side after opening, with little change.</p>
<h3>Notice of Yarn Purchase from the Textile Control Committee; Eight Factories Have Reported</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The yarn purchase notification from the Textile Control Committee has been received by eight factories yesterday: Ding Xin, Chong Xin, China Textile, Bao Feng, De Feng, Shen Xin No. 9 Factory, Xin He, and An Da. It is expected that the other factories will submit their reports successively today. After verification by the committee, the China Textile Construction Company's agency will handle the purchase on their behalf. In addition, regarding the daily production reports that the committee has distributed to the factories, the committee hopes that the factories will fill them out truthfully, regardless of whether it is a holiday or weekday, so that the committee can calculate the data accurately.</p>
<p>In addition, the Textile Control Committee's regular weekly meeting is scheduled to be held this afternoon at the Municipal Government Conference Room.</p>

<h3>Prices of Various Edible Oils Have Been Agreed Upon and Submitted for Approval and Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The edible oil pricing meeting was held at 3:00 PM yesterday in the meeting room on the third floor of the Social Affairs Bureau. Ji Mingzhai, the section chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, Qian Xingzhong, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and edible oil manufacturers Xie Yuxiang, Zhang Chao, Yang Mingzhou, He Zhenhan, and Zhao Yushu, etc., attended and adjourned the meeting around 4:00 PM.

<h3>Expanding Tea Loans; This Year's Total Exceeds 16 Billion; The Farmers Bank of China to Implement In-Kind Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>In order to assist the tea industry, the Farmers Bank of China has decided to expand tea loans this year, not limited to the areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. It will be held uniformly in all tea-producing areas of the country, in order to adapt to the needs of the tea industry. This approach was decided at the tea loan conference convened by the bank last year. It is reported that the bank is gradually advancing in accordance with the established methods. The bank is now dealing with tea loans as the tea leaves are about to mature and the tea factories are preparing to purchase. In the tea-producing areas of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, such as Qimen, Pingshui, Wenzhou, and Tunxi, the bank's branches have separately handled tea factory registration. According to the amount of green tea purchased after registration, the loan amount for each factory will be determined. The total amount of tea loans this year will be above 16.1 billion.</p>
<p>The Farmers Bank of China is launching in-kind agricultural loans, and the scope of implementation this year will be larger than last year. The bank is currently launching fishing loans in the Shengsi Islands first, and will send personnel there within days to sign contracts with the local fishermen. Secondly, water conservancy in-kind agricultural loans, fertilizer agricultural loans, etc., will be gradually promoted. As for other agricultural loan businesses, once the entire plan is approved by the head office, it will be implemented sequentially.</p>
<p>In order to support the silkworm seed industry, the Farmers Bank of China, in addition to providing seed production loans last year, has recently launched spring silkworm seed mortgage loans in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Methods have been formulated, and loans will be issued separately by branches and offices in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, etc. The amount for each seed production farm is set at 2 billion yuan, and each sheet of seed is loaned 2,000 yuan, with an interest rate of 3%, for a period of three months. The silkworm seeds stored in the warehouse will be the first collateral, and the factory buildings and furniture will be the second collateral.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Trade Lightly; Prices Mostly Fell, Few Rose</h3>

No. 207 and No. 169 entered the market, rising by more than ten yuan, but No. 145, etc., still had a desire to sell, so the price remained below 800 yuan at noon. The final result compared to the previous close was a slight decrease for Yong Yarn, Jingfu, Xin Guang, Qin Xing, and Hua Feng, a slight increase for Xin He, and a decrease of 0.5% for Meiya. For deferred delivery, Yong Yarn, Xin He, and Hua Feng had slight setbacks, and Xin Guang decreased by 0.5%. Cold stocks saw minimal changes, with only Yongye continuing to report a limit up.

After 3:00 PM, No. 198 vigorously purchased, and No. 152 also entered, rising to 809 yuan. No. 95 sold off some, and the price finally hovered around 805 yuan.

<p>Daily necessities such as soap and matches were priced higher due to the indefinite factory distribution and the dwindling spot goods on the market. Gu Ben and Arrow soap reached a peak of 140,000 yesterday, and Beauty matches also rose to 1.1 million per case. Prices of other grades also increased.</p>
<h3>Raw Sugar is in Short Supply; Prices are Firm and Steadily Increasing</h3>

The Guild's allocations of medium-grade white sugar for spot goods were 136,000 yuan, and warehouse receipts were 132,750 yuan to 132,500 yuan. Raw sugar initially started at 135,000 yuan, but later caught up with the price of medium-grade white sugar at 136,000 yuan, due purely to the shortage of goods. Other green and red sugars saw small decreases again. The Guangdong gang opened up Shunde Green at 94,500 yuan, and Chi Chi at 126,000 yuan, with over 200 packages transacted. The Ou gang opened up Wenzhou Green at 92,000 yuan, with dozens of packages.

<h3>The Total Number of Financial Institutions Nationwide is Over 5,000; Shanghai Has the Most at 564</h3>
<p>According to the Central Bank's Audit Office, as of December 31, 1946, the total number of financial institutions in all provinces and cities across the country was 5,411. Among them, 1,355 were head offices and 3,553 were branch offices. There were 3,644 banks, including 852 state-owned, 1,089 provincially-owned, 531 county and city-owned, and 1,172 commercially-owned. There were 458 silver firms, 454 money shops, 29 trust companies, 492 insurance companies, and 364 cooperative treasuries. By region, there were 115 in Nanjing, 564 in Shanghai, 128 in Peiping, 219 in Tianjin, 212 in Chongqing, 160 in Guangzhou, 147 in Hankou, 102 in Chengdu, 66 in Kunming, 26 in Guiyang, 105 in Xi'an, 34 in Lanzhou, 193 in Jiangsu, 449 in Zhejiang, 103 in Anhui, 194 in Jiangxi, 99 in Hubei, 172 in Hunan, 814 in Sichuan, 46 in Xikang, 182 in Fujian, 174 in Guangdong, 127 in Guangxi, 102 in Yunnan, 72 in Guizhou, 661 in Hebei, 163 in Henan, 120 in Shandong, 55 in Shanxi, 166 in Shaanxi, 120 in Gansu, 5 in Qinghai, 12 in Ningxia, 1 in Jehol, 1 in Chahar, 13 in Suiyuan, 33 in Xinjiang, 33 in the Northeast, and 16 in Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Lack of Power Affects Production</h3>
<p>According to textile industry sources, almost all factories in Shanghai are currently forced to stop work due to the impact of electricity. Recently, not only must work be stopped for two days each week, but there are also several hours of power outages each day. The Shanghai Electric Power Company has a total of 110,000 kilowatts, supplying only slightly more than 3 million spindles. But in addition to 2 million spindles in Shanghai, there are also many weaving and other industries, which require no less than 150,000 kilowatts. Therefore, it is questionable whether the existing power can be sufficient in the shortest period. Moreover, how many hundreds of enemy and puppet factories and newly established factories in Shanghai have not yet started work? Therefore, the lack of electricity in Shanghai is a predetermined fate, and if some textile factories in our country do not set up their own generators at this time and place, the losses from stopping work will be considerable.</p>
<h3>Rayon Factories' Transactions are All Cleared</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market in Shanghai yesterday saw a boost in sentiment due to limited allocation of goods, but the market required signed receipts for transactions in order to prevent allocated goods from flowing into the market. Therefore, the market wanted to rise but stopped, and there were no transactions. Yesterday, the quoted price for No. 120 Toyo Orilon was 3.5 million yuan, and the quoted prices for Takayama and Asahi were 3.4 million yuan, slightly firmer than the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory Jingyin businesses saw limited transactions due to the fact that loans from the banking industry were not yet available and money was difficult to turn over. Yesterday's quoted prices were slightly weaker than the previous day. D-grade was quoted at 5.3 million yuan, and Qianjing was negotiated at 4 million yuan, but there were no transactions. Silk fabrics also saw very weak buying due to financial constraints, and yesterday's market prices were the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>The City's Coal Reserves are Abundant; Coal Allocation Next Month Will Remain Normal; Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, Xu Letian, Releases a Statement</h3>
<p>There were widespread rumors that the prices of coal sold by the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs would be adjusted next month. A reporter specially visited Mr. Xu Letian, the chairman of the committee, yesterday. According to him, the decision to adjust the price of allocated coal has indeed been made. The main reason is to consider the costs of the miners, and the adjustment can slightly reduce losses. At present, the city's coal reserves are quite abundant. Coal arriving from various places is slightly affected due to the unresolved freezing of Qinhuangdao. Coal from Taiwan is continuously being shipped. The amount of coal allocated next month can be maintained at a normal state and will not change from this month. Mr. Xu also solemnly stated that the committee is making every effort to procure and transport coal dust, which is the raw material for household coal briquettes.

<h3>The Philippine Government Sets a Deadline for Exchanging New Currency; We Telegraph to Request an Extension to Facilitate Returning Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously received a telegram from the Embassy in the Philippines stating that the Philippine government has set a deadline of the end of January of this year for exchanging pre-war and wartime banknotes issued by the government for Victory banknotes. After the deadline, they will no longer be accepted. Anyone holding Philippine pesos without the "Victory" stamp should send them to the Philippines for exchange by the end of this month, and please inform the returning overseas Chinese, etc. After receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed the embassy, ​​asking the Philippine side to extend the deadline for Philippine pesos held by Chinese citizens in China, and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to convey it to relevant agencies. The Four United Relief Agencies notified the banks and bureaus yesterday (29th).</p>

<h3>Dried Longan Steps Upward</h3>
<p>As both the arrival and storage of dried longan are scarce, although the increase in the negotiated price is very small, the cost of the goods and cargo prevents it from being suppressed and instead sees an increase. Large ones initially started at 460,000 yuan, then rose to 480,000 yuan, and have now reached 500,000 yuan, and there is still upward pressure.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Qualification for Educational Personnel; The Jiangxi Education Department Requests the Ministry of Education to Specify Measures; The Ministry of Education is Consulting with the Ministry of Personnel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Teachers at all levels of schools and civil servants at all levels are both national workers. Therefore, the issue of teacher qualification is extremely important. All matters such as salaries, grades, seniority pay increases, and treatment guarantees should have explicit regulations so that teachers can participate in qualification when transferred to administrative agencies, based on their past qualifications. The Jiangxi Provincial Education Department has requested the Ministry of Education to specify measures for the qualification of educational personnel. The Ministry of Education has instructed that regarding the qualification of educational personnel, consultations have been held with the Ministry of Personnel, and once the measures are decided, they will be notified.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Meeting of Private School Principals in This City: Independently Deciding Tuition Standards; Mayor Wu's Earnest Address Respecting the Resolutions of the Attendees</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Private Primary and Secondary School Principals' Association of this city, to discuss the tuition standards determined by the City Council, specially convened its fourth general meeting at Yucai Middle School yesterday afternoon. Over four hundred and thirty people attended, including Shi Jiadong, Xu Wenxiang, Xiang Enyuan, Yu Chuanding, representing over six hundred units. Mayor Wu, as well as Director Gu of the City Education Bureau, Deputy Director Li, Section Chief Zhu, Section Chief Xie, and others also attended as observers.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address</p>
<p>Jiang Jizhou, Gao Erbo, and Shen Tongyi formed the presidium. After Chairman Gao Erbo reported the purpose of the meeting, Mayor Wu delivered a speech stating: He personally believes that education is the fundamental undertaking of the nation; if education is not done well, China has no hope. The ancients said: "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parents, Teacher," and he has always placed great importance on the way of the teacher. He came to Shanghai to take office as mayor last May, and before the City Council convened in September, he automatically increased the education budget from nine percent to twenty percent. This time, the City Council determined tuition standards, and the principals of private primary and secondary schools published notices in the newspapers. After reading them, he felt very distressed. When private school teachers petitioned the other day, he had already stated that there were two conflicting mentalities: to do education well, the lives of teachers and staff must be stable, but at the same time, due to price increases, the burden on parents should also be considered. Moreover, the treatment of teachers and staff in private schools is even more constrained by public schools. We must respect the way of the teacher, promote education, but at the same time, we must consider democratic politics. Shanghai is an international city, and to achieve democratization, we must respect the decisions of the representative body—the City Council. If a stalemate develops, it will either leave teachers and staff without a way out, or democracy will fail in Shanghai. He believes that 99% of the private school principals in this city are good, and 99% of the private school teachers and staff are good, because he has confidence and believes that China has a future and that the intellectual class has a future. If he, as mayor, is scolded by others every day, as long as he asks himself if he is at peace and is true to himself, he will not care. The intellectual class cannot be emotional and must consider the overall situation. He now has three suggestions: (1) Respect China's democratic cause; (2) Seek stability in the lives of teachers and staff; (3) Take this opportunity to rectify all private schools in this city so that 100% are good. The implementation methods for these three suggestions are: (1) To ensure the protection of the democratic cause, each school should temporarily comply with the tuition standards set by the City Council. (2) Compile statistics comparing school expenditures and teacher/staff compensation before and after the war, and submit them to the Education Bureau. The City Government will submit a request for reconsideration to the City Council, which will reconvene soon, based on the facts. This is a reasonable path. (3) Remove the one percent of bad actors to demonstrate that private schools are solely for the service of society and the people. A committee should be organized by principals and teachers/staff, and all school finances should be made public. If the above three methods are implemented, the stalemate can be broken, parents can understand, society can sympathize, the democratic cause can be protected, and a stable solution can be negotiated for everyone's livelihood. He hopes everyone will adopt these suggestions!</p>
<p>Director's Address</p>
<p>Director Gu then delivered a speech stating: The Education Bureau feels ashamed that the tuition standards proposed for discussion by the Council were misunderstood regarding the work of educators despite his explanation. The general mentality of society always points out the bad aspects of the education community. As the saying goes, "Conceal evil and promote good," but so far, good is concealed and evil is promoted. At that time, the tuition standards proposed by the Education Bureau were said by the principals of various primary and secondary schools to be only barely sustainable, but the discussion by the Council resulted in this outcome. Today, it is not a matter of increasing a few tens of thousands of yuan, but rather a matter of misunderstanding and lack of sympathy for private schools, which makes everyone feel uncomfortable psychologically. Many parents are willing to provide their children with a good education and do not care about tens of thousands of yuan. Moreover, last year, he contacted and negotiated with the City Bank and agreed to provide loans to students' parents, but very few parents applied. Although there are now a few councilors who are unsympathetic to private schools, they are not responsible to the outside world. He hopes that everyone will correct the points they criticize if they exist, and if not, encourage themselves. Moreover, during the discussion, 51 votes were in favor of increasing tuition, and 50 votes were against it, so everyone can be satisfied in terms of morality because the majority sympathize. Regarding the free quota for middle schools, the Council decided on 25%. There is a way to solve this problem, that is, each school board member will bear several quotas and solve it through fundraising. Now the City Government does not have the strength, but we can find ways to subsidize. Looking back at Shanghai's industry and commerce, which one is improving? It can be said that only the education sector is thriving, so there is still reason to be optimistic. He believes that the education sector will definitely gain the sympathy of society and the assistance of all parties in the near future.</p>
<p>Principals' Opinions</p>
<p>The principals attending the meeting spoke enthusiastically, stating that due to the economic downturn in the industrial and commercial sectors, the burden on parents should indeed be considered, but recalling the beginning of the last semester, teachers left their jobs one after another due to low salaries, and the principals could not find teachers. This pain can still be imagined. The circumstances of each private school are different, and the facts must be considered legally and reasonably, so rigid regulations cannot be made.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>(1) After discussion and decision, in order to strive for the right of principals to decide tuition fees themselves, it was voted that the tuition standards for private schools for the second semester of the 36th year [1947] are as follows: Elementary school tuition: 120,000 yuan, miscellaneous fees: 40,000 yuan, totaling 160,000 yuan; Junior high school tuition: 170,000 yuan, miscellaneous fees: 80,000 yuan, totaling 250,000 yuan; Senior high school tuition: 220,000 yuan, miscellaneous fees: 80,000 yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan. This resolution will be submitted to the City Government for record. The schools will charge according to these standards for this semester. The above tuition fees are all maximum amounts, and each school does not necessarily have to charge the maximum amount. (2) Regarding the free places, the City Council set the free quota at 20% and the half-price quota at 10%, totaling 25% full exemption. It was resolved to change the elementary school to 20% and the middle school to 15%, with the remaining amount subsidized by the Education Bureau. (3) Regarding the issue of financial transparency, the following implementation methods were resolved: (A) The accounting methods currently used by each school vary, and schools also differ in size, making it difficult to uniformly audit the finances using one format. It was resolved to hire two accountants to create two types of account books, A and B, based on the size of the school, for the use of private school accounting. (B) Regarding the verification of whether the finances of each school are used reasonably, it was resolved to notify the audit committees to be fully responsible. (C) The finances of each school will be reported to the school board at the end of the semester, and then disclosed in the regular publications issued by the board. (4) After discussing the case of the 500 million yuan subsidy for private schools set by the Education Bureau for the first semester of the 35th year [1946], which was passed by the City Council but has not yet been allocated, it was resolved to request the City Government to allocate it for student loans for impoverished students in this semester. (5) Regarding the 60 million yuan raised by the Education Loan Committee, about 40 million yuan has been allocated to teachers in various schools, leaving more than 20 million yuan. The director of the Loan Committee, Chen Ruhui, advocated depositing it in the Dacheng Bank, but the bank declared bankruptcy in December last year. The authorities are asked to investigate the issue of responsibility.</p>

<h3>The Thousand Wonders and Mysteries of the World's Capital</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wang Yizhi of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Paris, 10th [of month not specified], Airmail</p>
<p>Since Paris reconvened the peace conference in 1946, and with the publicity of "science, literature, and education," it can stand first among the major cities of the world, worthy of being the world's capital. There are more than ten things that contribute to this. To illustrate, one is the Capital of Jewels. In French, Joaillerie (jewelry or gem trade) shares the same origin as the French word Jole (joy) or the Portuguese word Joia (jewel). Western customs value fashion, novelty, and women's crowns, shoes, clothing, which are constantly changing. Thus, they cannot be stored for long nor used for a long time. Only gemstones and jewelry can endure and are valued for the skill of the craftsmen and the elegance of their form. Diplomats purchasing jewels invariably seek them in the large stores around Place Vendome in Paris. Upon returning to their respective capitals, they flaunt them as archetypical Parisian style. In the past, Vienna was known as Little Paris, and Viennese-style gems and fine crafts were also valued in the world. Two is the Capital of Fashion (La Mode). It has been over a year since the end of the European War. Although there are still cumbersome restrictions on buying cars in Paris with US dollars or Swiss francs, the source of gasoline has widened, and the number of cars traveling on the streets is increasing daily. Thus, women's clothing before 1946, due to the difficulty of going out and riding in cars, was simple and resistant to wind and rain. The latest fashions, because social engagements all involve riding in cars, follow the meaning of the idiom "adding flowers to brocade," and are often seen with large floral decorations. The hats worn are adorned with tall, elegant feathers, and the colors all strive to be light and bright. A certain pink color that is currently popular in the Paris market is a new invention of the fashion industry. Three is the Capital of Perfumes (Parfums). Grasse perfume factories in southern France extract the fragrances of flowers from various countries, permeating them into fat, sealing them tightly for ten years without a slight release, and then extracting the fragrance to create the most famous and best-selling perfumes. The quality and variety of French perfumes are unmatched in the world. New perfumes currently on the market, such as Jndiscret (Indiscreet) perfume, are meant to be strongly fragrant. The French usually call a light and indistinct fragrance a "restrained fragrance" (parfum discret), so Indiscreet is the opposite of discreet. Perfumes such as Mystere (Mystery) and Vertige (Vertigo) are all meant to describe the novelty of the fragrance. Perfumes like Nuit de Longchamp (Longchamp Night) refer to Longchamp, a famous racetrack in Paris, which is also a place for nighttime dances and entertainment, so those who see the name can understand its meaning and imagine the prosperous atmosphere of Paris. The fragrance of Cuir de Russie (Russian Leather) is commonly used by men, while Quelques fleurs (A Few Flowers), which is obviously exclusively for women, is its opposite. Four is the Capital of Antiques. Antiques, referring to interior furnishings, should mainly consist of valuable old wooden furniture, accompanied by old paintings. Paris was not bombed during the war, so sales of old paintings and old wooden furniture are excellent. During the war, connoisseurs collecting old wooden furniture preferred items from the 18th century, starting from 1700 to 1800 (similar to objects from the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong reigns of the early Qing Dynasty). After the war, the aforementioned objects were difficult to obtain, so social customs changed and people competed to search for objects from the following hundred years, such as the "Napoleon III style" and the "Sarah Bernhardt style" from the late 19th century. Bernhardt was a Jewish French actress who died twenty-five years ago, and whose fame and glory were no less than those of great generals and wise kings. Today, Western art history highlights this famous woman, and her name marks an era, comparing her to emperors such as Napoleon III, Jiaqing, and Tongzhi. How fortunate this woman is to have been born in France, a country that respects artists, and to rival Xi Shi and Wang Zhaojun of our Eastern lands. Five is the Capital of Dance. New dances in Paris include Lac Cyrnes (Swan Lake) and Le Spectre de la Rose (The Specter of the Rose), both of which are meant to describe the emotions of dance and are different from social dances, considered "artistic dances." Those who are skilled often display their talents on stage. There are also dances such as Fire Dance, Desire Dance, and Amour Dance (Danse de 1'Amoru). Six is the Capital of New Art. Paris is known for new artistic paintings (an example is attached), which knowledgeable people often find difficult to appreciate. Being unaccustomed to it is one reason. At the same time, Paris can be the world's capital because of its unique strengths, such as exhibitions, concert halls, theaters, movies, circuses, puppet shows seen by the roadside, delicacies, fine wines, and rare ancient books that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Paris has them all. Great is Paris, lovable is today's Paris.</p>
<p>The train passes through the Great Salt Lake (report from special correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<h3>Crossing North America: A 10,000-Li Journey in Five Days and Nights (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent to This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Deep into the Rocky Mountains</p>
<p>California, 13th (by airmail)</p>
<p>The second day after the New Year, the reporter Maurice of the Telegraph wanted to take a vacation on both coasts and I accompanied him. In haste, I left New York.</p>
<p>From New York to San Francisco, over three thousand two hundred miles, is equivalent to going from Shanghai to Xinjiang. Before the construction of the railway, Americans of the previous generation, relying on their enthusiasm and courage, dragged heavy wooden carts and arduously developed this American continent, which was considered mysterious.</p>
<p>Taking the Pullman Train Instead of a Cheaper Airplane</p>
<p>The transcontinental railway of America was not built until after the Civil War, less than eighty years ago.</p>
<p>The fastest train takes three nights and four days. Therefore, after the development of the civil aviation industry, many wealthy merchants, or prominent military and political figures, and even those with slightly less straitened circumstances, have switched to taking airplanes. The air ticket costs 118 US dollars, plus transportation tax, which is still cheaper than a full-journey "sleeper car ticket." The flight time is less than twenty hours.</p>
<p>However, when winter comes, many people are still willing to take the train. Last month, a plane departing from New York crashed in Nevada two hours before arriving in San Francisco. Like the plane crash in Shanghai, all the passengers perished, except for a three-year-old child, who survived unscathed.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also decided to take the train.</p>
<p>I took the "Pullman" train to Chicago and stayed in Chicago for a day. Chicago has snowdrifts over a foot deep, which is even more spectacular than the "silver world" of New York State. A friend's private car was stuck in the snow, and it took seven black laborers to push it out. At night, walking on Lake Michigan, the blood seemed unable to circulate. Experienced Americans in Chicago treat winter as their season for hibernation. They huddle around the stove waiting for summer; "Summer belongs to us! Doesn't it? Soon it will be spring, and after spring, won't it be summer?"</p>
<p>Half a year ago, I came here, and it was Chicago's golden season. The young men and women who usually floated on the lake, and the thousands of people who usually enjoyed the green grass, are now nowhere to be seen! Desolate, lonely, and bleak, winter is the end of Chicago!</p>
<p>I rushed to the Northwest Station in the piercing wind. The "Challenger" train, which departed at ten o'clock in the evening, went directly to San Francisco. Around nine o'clock, the iron gate outside the station was already crowded with people, mostly GIs whose Christmas holidays had expired. They were rushing back to the barracks in San Francisco, and a small part of them were going to embark on ships to Japan and China.</p>
<p>The station was filled with disorderly noise, irregular military songs, mixed with loud shouts and roars. In the ten minutes before the train departed, the scramble was so fierce that it could not be seen even in the most "free" China and France. An old lady broke her arm in the crush and fell to the ground groaning. A little girl had the "handle" of her suitcase squeezed off. Unsophisticated "country folk" choked back tears, but those brave "strong men" still shouted and laughed wildly.</p>
<p>I remembered what a certain congressman said in Congress a month ago: "A long-term conscription system will weaken the quality of American soldiers and further reduce the moral standards of American citizens"!</p>
<p>I told him that I had stayed in Switzerland for a week, and he happily compared it to me: "In the states of Nevada, Utah, and Colorado, there are many small towns in mountain valleys, with green mountains and clear waters, and skiing and ice skating in winter, just like Lausanne, Locarno, Bern, and Geneva in Switzerland."</p>
<p>In reality, the Rocky Mountains are not as ideally undulating as one might think. An old man of Greek origin told me: "The Rocky Mountains cannot be compared to the Alps or the Himalayas at all." The United States itself has more plains than mountains. Although the land area is similar to that of China, according to my rough estimate, the arable land in the United States is more than twice that of China. In Iowa and Nebraska, many very fertile black soil areas are still left uncultivated.</p>
<p>Along the way, Wyoming is considered the poorest state, an endless semi-desert grassland where many herds of cattle and sheep are looking for pasture. An army officer said: Wyoming is very similar to Arizona, Arizona is an arid desert area, and Wyoming is a semi-desert area. He said: "A long time ago, in a place in Wyoming, a farmer threw a cigarette butt on the ground, and suddenly, the wilderness burst into flames, a lone wildfire that burned crimson in the sky for thirty-five years."</p>
<p>This is not a myth. Later, geologists discovered oil deposits there.</p>
<p>Trendy Things in the "Rocky Mountain Empire"</p>
<p>Entering the state of Utah from Wyoming means stepping into the Rocky Mountain region. Local residents have a special name for themselves: they call themselves the "Rocky Mountain Empire." On the train, I bought a newspaper from the state of Colorado, which contained a large "Notice from This Newspaper," roughly saying: "In order to enable readers in the Rocky Mountain Empire to understand the changes in American women's clothing in 1947, this newspaper has specially dispatched female reporter Miss Krings to be stationed in New York all the time, providing weekly reports on New York fashion."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not meet any "subjects" from the Rocky Mountain Empire on the train. I have no way of knowing what differences there are between their current clothing and that of New York and Chicago.</p>
<p>The Rocky Mountains stretch from Canada to Mexico, extending north and south. There is a gap near Ogden, which the railway used for construction purposes. If this gap is equivalent to the "Hexi Corridor" in Gansu Province, China, then the city of Ogden is equivalent to the Jiayuguan of the United States. Ogden Railway Station has a slightly Japanese-style architecture, with Chinese-style black tiles on the roof. There are a few large characters on the station: "Gateway to the American West."</p>

<p>On the "Challenger" train, I sat for four days and nights, traversing three-quarters of the North American continent, passing through the fertile agricultural areas of Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska, as well as the semi-desert arid grasslands of Wyoming, and crossing the spine of the United States, the Rocky Mountains, as well as the states of Utah and Nevada where the Rocky Mountains are located, finally arriving at the "Golden Homeland" of California on the West Coast.</p>
<p>If New York is compared to Shanghai, China, Chicago should be Wuhan, China. To build a railway from Wuhan to Tacheng in Xinjiang, one must pass through the agricultural areas of Henan and Shaanxi, the grasslands of northwestern Gansu, and finally enter "China's California" - Xinjiang Province. (Note: Time magazine has referred to Xinjiang as China's California several times).</p>
<p>All the railways in the United States are privately owned (with only one exception). The ownership of the main lines crossing North America is divided among four companies: the section from New York to Chicago belongs to the New York Central Railroad Company; the section from Chicago to Omaha (at the junction of Iowa and Nebraska) belongs to the "Northwestern Railroad Company"; the section from Omaha to Ogden, Utah, is jointly operated by several Pacific railroad companies, who have specially established an organization called the "Union Pacific Railroad Company"; and the section from Ogden to San Francisco belongs purely to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company.</p>
<h3>The Gateway to the Great West: Ogden City</h3>
<p>The train stopped at Ogden Station for several hours. I toured the entire city of Ogden. The streets and buildings are just like those in Lausanne. Outside the city, in the distance, one can see the folded peaks of the Rocky Mountains and the white snow that never melts on the mountaintops.</p>
<p>The city is full of small shops selling souvenirs, specially prepared for passing travelers. There are many Japanese people, selling small toys and the like. I chatted a lot in a Japanese shop. The owner's name is Nakamura. His tall son interrupted and said, "Please don't talk to us about Japan, okay? Because we are all American citizens now!"</p>
<p>They said that Ogden has many tourists because travelers from Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Francisco all have to pass through Ogden before going to Chicago, Boston, or New York.</p>
<h3>The Train Crosses the Great Salt Lake: The Journey Takes Fifty-Five Minutes</h3>
<p>West of Ogden is the beautiful Great Salt Lake, and southwest of Ogden is the prosperous Salt Lake County. Salt Lake County was developed by an American named Mormons a hundred years ago (January 1847). He defeated the Red Indians and established Western social institutions. Today, Salt Lake City is a major metropolis with a population of 150,000, one of the largest in the "Rocky Mountain Empire."</p>
<p>The train to San Francisco does not pass through Salt Lake City, but it crosses the Great Salt Lake. At both ends of the Great Salt Lake, there are long embankments, and the railway tracks are built on the embankments. In the middle of the lake, there is a very long iron bridge, specially for trains to use. I calculated that the time crossing the lake took a total of fifty-five minutes. The construction of the embankments and the bridge is very impressive.</p>
<p>The Great Salt Lake produces huge amounts of salt, and the production situation is like that of Zigong, Sichuan. But in terms of the similarities between the geography of China and the United States, the Great Salt Lake is like Qinghai Lake in China. The lake water is dark blue, and there are no small boats with oars or sails on the lake.</p>
<p>Around the lake, one can see the undulating peaks of the Rocky Mountains in the distance. At five o'clock in the evening, a ray of sunset shines on the mountain light, snow shadows, and water colors, bringing a sense of natural beauty.</p>
<h3>Professor Guo Qilan Talks About Railway History: East-West Convergence and Traffic Failure</h3>
<p>Before departing, I heard Professor Guo Qilan of New York University talk a bit about American transportation, especially the history of American railway construction. This professor has written several books on the history of American economic construction, and in each book, his conclusion is: "The economic prosperity enjoyed by the United States today can be said to be entirely due to the foresight of the previous generation, that is, the large-scale railway construction between the 1870s and 1880s."</p>
<p>According to Professor Guo Qilan, famous railway entrepreneurs of the time all intended to build a railway from the Atlantic coast across to the Pacific coast, but: first, they did not have enough financial resources, and second, it was difficult to construct through the Rocky Mountains. But: Why was it finally completed in the end? That was entirely due to government assistance. The government issued bonds, sparing no effort to help these emerging Pacific railway companies. The federal government used unconditional sacrifices to reward private enterprises that contributed to the country.</p>
<p>Professor Guo also said: "At that time, the instruments and materials were simple, and the talents of the engineers were limited, but in order to open the line as soon as possible, it was decided to rush to construction from both the east and west ends at the same time, so as to converge in the middle and open the line. But, alas, when it was built to the middle, it could not be connected, because the maps were inaccurate, and the engineers' designs were too hasty"!</p>
<p>This railway has been renovated several times in the past seventy years. I have no way of knowing, but based on my observation along the way, I feel that it is still extremely simple. The sleepers are all laid flat on the ground, without the raised "earthwork projects" like the Jinghu and Huhangyong lines. In the severe winter, the white snow adds a lot of difficulty to the driving.</p>
<h3>Silver World: A Chorus of "Cold"</h3>
<p>The three thousand plus miles of the North American continent are all a silver world. Compared to the whole United States, the Midwest lakeside states are the coldest. On the dining car, I said: "Chicago is the coldest." An old man interjected: "Wisconsin is even colder than Chicago." Another old lady chimed in: "What is Wisconsin? Do you know how thick the snow is in Minnesota?"</p>
<p>An old man of Greek origin, Kostkoless, sitting next to me, gently told me: "Don't argue with her. What's so great about Minnesota being cold? Go to Ogden and look at the snow in the Rocky Mountains! It snows there all year round, just like Switzerland!"</p>
<h3>The Premier Rice Market: Wuhu</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yu Ning Po of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch, 16th</p>
<p>Wuhu, located more than forty miles upstream from Nanjing, is the largest commercial port near the capital and the premier rice market in China.  It occupies a vital position in the Yangtze River waterway transportation, and in land transportation, it has the Jiangpu Railway, which connects with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Before the war, a passenger train left Shanghai North Station every morning, directly reaching Wuhu. The nearby Chaohu irrigation area and the Qingyi River basin are highly productive in rice. Most of the grain needed annually in places like Guangde, Chao County, Xuancheng, and Ningguo is supplied from here, earning it the name "Wuhu Rice."</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Rice Market   The annual rice production in the various counties of southern Anhui, after supplying the local population's food needs, still has a surplus of six to ten million shi. Most of this surplus is exported through Wuhu. The rice sold is exchanged for money to allow the villagers to pay taxes and to regulate the national food supply. Therefore, a large part of Wuhu's commerce and the entire economy of Anhui are based on Wuhu's rice market.</p>
<p>During the war and in the year after the recovery, the Wuhu rice market experienced sluggish sales, and the accumulated malpractices and customary fees became even more aggravated than before, becoming the focus of general industrial and commercial criticism. Recently, there has been a proposal to move the rice market to Yuxikou in He County. The already tottering Wuhu rice market certainly cannot withstand the cold winds. It has caused rice merchants to feel confused, hesitant, and anxious, leading them to launch a joint movement to save it.  Amidst the attention and hopes of all parties regarding this issue, the reporter will provide a transparent view of the past situation of the Wuhu rice market and its current changing trends:</p>
<p>The Jiangnan rice market used to gather in Zhenjiang. If Jiangsu had a poor harvest, it would move to Wuhu; if Anhui had a poor harvest, it would move to Zhenjiang. The gathering of the rice market depended on the abundance or scarcity of the Jiangnan harvest.</p>
<p>Anhui is the richest rice-producing area among the southeastern provinces. Both banks of the river, extending over a thousand miles, are fertile plains. This plain area is irrigated by the Yangtze River and has the Wan River, Chaohu Lake, Shuiyang River, Qingyi River, and other waters networked within it, thus forming a vast paddy field area in central and southern Anhui, producing large quantities of rice.</p>
<p>(Above) The Gate of the Rocky Mountains - Mountain and Water Scenery on the Outskirts of Ogden City (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<p>Quality of Wuhu Rice The purchasing and transporting industries are divided into four groups: Guangde, Chao County, Xuancheng, and Ningguo. The quality of the rice they purchase is mostly determined by the living habits of the local people. An analysis yields the following three categories: (A) Brown rice, needed by the Guangde and Chao County groups for re-milling. (B) High-grade white rice, needed by the Xuancheng and Tianjin groups for northern people's rice porridge, with a constant stream throughout the year. (C) Broken rice, most popular with the Ningbo group, commonly known as rice crumbs, used as a raw material for brewing alcohol due to its low price. In addition to the above three types, there are also special high-grade rice (produced in southern Wuhu), second-grade high-grade, medium-grade, high-grade (produced in Jiangbei), high-grade brown rice (produced in Nanling), and pounded ripe rice, among other varieties.</p>
<p>Regarding rice varieties, in 1934, the Wuhu County Government, under orders, organized a rice variety verification committee, hiring Zhang Jiazheng, director of the Wuhu Rice Improvement Farm, and Li Suanyu, professor at the Agricultural College, as members. Zhou Shilu, a technician specially dispatched by the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, provided guidance, collected excellent rice seeds, and instructed the production areas to follow and improve them.</p>
<p>Organization of Rice Groups Since Wuhu is a city based on rice, the exchange of agricultural products and trade relies on it, and all industries depend on its turnover. Due to the large scale of operations, organizational structures are indispensable. The same industry has the following organizations: (1) Rice Purchasing and Transporting Industry Association: These merchants specialize in purchasing rice in Wuhu and transporting it to other places. The Guangde, Chao County, Xuancheng, and Ningbo groups all collect and transport rice to Guangdong, Chaozhou, Yantai, Ningbo, Shandong, Zhejiang, Pingjin, and other places. The rice shops established by each group total more than twenty. (2) Rice Trading Industry Association: These buy rice from the countryside and resell it to the purchasing and transporting industry. There are more than forty such rice shops. (3) Machine Rice Milling Industry Association: These process the brown rice transported to Wuhu from the countryside into milled rice or rent storage space to rice shops and rice trading companies. There are eight or nine companies. (4) Rice Hulling Workshop Association: These are old-style rice hulling workshops that specialize in hulling rice for a fee. There are forty such workshops. (5) Miscellaneous Grain and Rice Shop Association: Their business nature is to specialize in selling rice for the daily consumption of the city's residents, so they are also known as small markets. The above belongs to the merchants' organization.</p>
<p>The workers' organization also has the following five types: (1) Sail Transport Industry: This industry is responsible for transportation. All rice coming to Wuhu from the countryside must be loaded onto their sailboats. In addition to the considerable compensation they receive, they can also earn extra rice, resulting in substantial profits. (2) Measuring Industry: This industry is responsible for measuring rice. When a rice boat docks, after the shop and the company have completed the transaction, the rice shop hires workers from the measuring industry to measure the rice on the boat for packaging. In addition to the regular wage (measuring labor), there is also a "measuring allowance." (3) Bag Stitching Industry: This industry specializes in loading rice into bags and then stitching the openings with hemp skin for transportation. (4) Bag Carrying Industry: This industry specializes in carrying the completed rice bags into the warehouse or from the warehouse to the dock. (5) Dockworkers: These workers specialize in transporting rice bags to barges or lighters for transportation.</p>
<p>Extensive Sales Channels The destinations for Wuhu rice are extensive. Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Dalian in North China; Guangzhou, Chaozhou, and Xiamen in the southeast; and Shanghai, Ningbo, and various places in northern Jiangsu in the east are all basic markets for consuming Wuhu rice. The Wuhu rice consumed in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Dalian is transported by merchants from the Yantai group. The rice sold in Shanghai and Ningbo is transported by the Ningbo group. The rice in Shantou and Xiamen is transported by the Chaozhou group, and the rice in Guangzhou is transported by merchants from the Guangdong group. The amount consumed in each place is the largest in Guangzhou, at three to four million shi per year. Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yingkou, Dalian, and Longkou consume about one million shi per year. Ningbo consumes four to five hundred thousand shi per year. Shanghai, Tongzhou, Nanjing, and other places are mostly transported and sold directly by Anhui merchants.</p>
<p>Rice Market Transactions The annual sales of Wuhu rice, amounting to several million shi, cannot be considered a small amount in terms of quantity. This rice is accumulated from the countryside in small quantities. After the harvest, a portion of the grain goes to the landlord's warehouse, and another portion belongs to the farmers themselves. The landlord can hoard the grain and sell it when the time is right. The farmers, compelled by the need to repay loans for fertilizers, seeds, cattle rent, wages, and other expenses incurred during the busy farming season, have no choice but to sell a portion or all of their rice to repay the debts that are due. Every year, after the early and late rice harvests, the rice that cannot be stored is carried by manpower, transported by wheelbarrows, or transported to towns and cities in small boats and sold to rice hulling workshops, grain shops, and rice dealers in towns and cities, waiting for the rise and fall of the Wuhu market to determine the size of their purchases. The purchased rice is then loaded onto sailboats and transported to Wuhu.</p>
<p>After the rice boats from the surrounding villages arrive in Wuhu, the rice sellers stay in the rice shops. The rice shops contact the rice trading companies. The buyers and sellers do not need to meet to conduct transactions. All procedures are the responsibility of the rice trading companies. The sellers' accommodation is provided by the shops, and the buyers' accommodation is provided by the companies, free of charge. After the transaction is successful, both parties deduct commissions from the customers. The expenses deducted by the shops from the sellers include shop commission, return commission, labor fee, discount fee, return slips, labor fee, packaging fee, liquor fee, tobacco and alcohol money, discount, opening warehouse fee, liquor fee, etc. The expenses deducted by the companies from the buyers include education donation, warehouse rent, hemp skin fee, usage fee, insurance, stamp duty, etc.</p>
<p>Customers can pay for rice purchased in the large market every other day. Rice purchased in the small market must be paid for in cash. When purchasing rice from rice companies or rice shops, the customers bring the money and deposit it with the shop, which provides a receipt and assumes full responsibility. After the customers have purchased the rice, whether it is packaged or not, they only need the original shop to handle it temporarily stored in various warehouses. If the customers need money, the shops and warehouses can also provide loans, with the loan amount based on the amount of rice stored.</p>
<p>Heavy Malpractices</p>
<p>Heavy Malpractices   The Wuhu rice market has a long history of several decades. The total number of merchants and workers who depend on rice for their livelihoods is no less than seventy to eighty thousand. The long-standing malpractices are indeed unbreakable. The rice is produced in the countryside. After it is transported from the farmers' hands, the process is extremely complex, and the expenses are higher than in other ports. It is divided into two parts: industry and commerce. The buyers are the merchants who purchase and transport rice. The sellers are the rice shops. The rice processing industry includes rice milling workshops and rice hulling workshops. The retail merchants include miscellaneous grain shops, among others. Among the workers, there are five types: sail transport workers, measuring industry workers, bag stitching workers, bag carrying workers, and dockworkers. These workers not only receive wages but also engage in illegal malpractices. For example, the boatmen add sand and water to the rice to increase its weight, which is the biggest cause of rice spoilage. In addition, the measuring allowance and bag stitching also have tricks. The dockworkers use a pointed tube to leak rice without revealing any flaws. Besides, there are extra odd jobs, local security, gangsters, beggars, and helpless widows who all have expenses, and the amount of expenses per day is very large, which makes the rice merchants feel headache and criticized. Although they have repeatedly requested the authorities to ban them, it is actually impossible to eliminate them.</p>
<p>New Opportunity   In the year since the recovery, the sales channels of the Wuhu rice market have changed abnormally, like a reversed magnetic needle, from south to north, from Hunan and Guangdong to Tianjin and Qingdao. This is an unprecedented phenomenon. This phenomenon is certainly related to changes in time and situation because the large army stationed in the northern country consists of Jiangnan rice eaters. Therefore, military rice is transported to the north in a constant stream, but the actual sales market in Tianjin is limited. Good times do not last long, and they will soon fade away. In addition, the price of rice in the north has been falling like running water. In the second half of last November, the rice transported from Wuhu to Tianjin was affected by the falling price of rice, causing all rice merchants to return empty-handed. The Wuhu rice, which was about to be revived, suffered this blow, presenting a gloomy picture.</p>
<p>Last month, people from the Chao Lake basin - Lu and other seven counties advocated moving the Wuhu rice market to Yuxikou in He County. Although this rumor lacks objective conditions and is unlikely to succeed, if it unfortunately comes true, the Wuhu rice market will inevitably be diminished. The reason why it suffered the attack of moving the market is that the long-standing fees and malpractices have become the target of criticism.</p>
<p>In the spring and summer of last year, the industry and commerce sides almost turned red in the face for the sake of eliminating malpractices and reducing expenses. They maintained their position for half a year but failed to resolve the issue. They watched the peak sales season of September and October pass lightly. During this period, Wuhu rice only sold more than 300,000 packages to Tianjin. All the people in Anhui who calculated to recover the Wuhu rice market believed that without eliminating the malpractices and fees, the Wuhu rice market would have no hope of recovery. Therefore, rice industry people and Wuhu business community launched a campaign to reduce fees and attract customers last month. Representatives of rice merchants from various industries gathered in the Chamber of Commerce and voluntarily reduced fees by 30%, simplified transaction procedures, and urgently tried to save the situation.</p>
<p>In the two months when Wuhu rice suffered misfortune, it happened that the Wuhu branch of the Agricultural Bank was ordered to purchase rice in Wuhu, transporting in large quantities to the production area without restriction, which led to Wuhu rice market being in a situation of no external source and internal difficulties. Fortunately, the meeting ended satisfactorily and decided to telegraph the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the County Assembly, County Government, Sixth District Commissioner's Office, Four-Union Headquarters, and the Central Agricultural Bank. Regarding the improvement of the Wuhu rice market, such as the reduction of rice shop commissions, the original commissions will be reduced by 30% from now on and announced for implementation, so as to avoid excuses from all parties. According to the current rules, calculating the rice price at 40,000 yuan per shi, the shop commission is six points, totaling 2,400 yuan, reduced by three points, totaling 727 yuan, which is more than two-thirds less than before. Other malpractices and fees are, of course, also subject to elimination. At a minimum, there is a possibility of gradual elimination. In this way, the rice merchants deeply feel that the shackles of heavy burdens have been relieved, and their psychology feels lighter because the merchants' trade is first in reducing costs, and moving the market to other places and selling directly are all hoping to reduce costs. Now that the existing market can eliminate the accumulated habits that are hated by everyone, why would the rice merchants not be happy to choose this over that? The trend of the Wuhu rice market in the future will really be "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and you doubt there is no road, a willow is dark and the flowers are bright again" and "when things reach the extreme, they will reverse, or is it that the Wuhu rice market will recover from the extreme"?</p>
<h3>Lingering Years in Guilin: A Brief Account of Stinky Rice Noodles</h3>
<p>— Liang Xiaozhong, Correspondent for This Newspaper in Guilin</p>
<p>Guilin Dispatch, December 30th</p>
<p>Someone suggested: forcing the relief sub-office colleagues to try stinky rice for a month, fearing that this would inevitably involve a bit of "emotional involvement," it is truly: "stinky rice should only be eaten by refugees, how can the sub-office get a taste of it!"</p>
<p>The transformations in Guangxi from its fall to its recovery have been like a terrible nightmare. From the Great Exodus to the Great Famine, and then from the Great Famine to the Great Exploitation, it has been left completely devastated, with not a single intact tile in any home. Though today’s Guilin is moving towards prosperity, the magnificent Cross Street Square, where the people fought tooth and nail but failed to open two years ago, is now easily completed. New buildings, row upon row, are appearing before the world. The provincial government is also working on reclaiming the old site within the Imperial City. Everything seems so rushed, one cannot help but fantasize with the notion that "If winter is here, can spring be far behind?" But who will bother digging out those who are forever mired in this harsh winter? Yes, Guangxi’s construction is progressing, and we need not gild the lily, just as we need not cover up the signs of decline. From calm observation over the years, I always feel that Guangxi’s popular sentiment is progressive and willing to work hard. On the other hand, one also senses that the people of Guangxi are constantly preparing some kind of resistance to backward politics. At first glance, it may seem a bit abstract, but it is, in fact, a rather concrete observation. To govern does not require much talk, and to observe politics does not require much talk. The people need spring so desperately!</p>
<p>In the tranquil atmosphere of street leaflets, there are always small storms that arouse people's interest, allowing a glimpse into the inner workings of officialdom, often revealing a part of the whole. For instance, half a month ago, the streets and alleys were plastered with a leaflet accusing a newly appointed bureau chief of using connections to buy his position. It also implicated the speaker of the provincial assembly, who was supposed to be the voice of the people. The leaflet listed how much the bureau chief spent, how much so-and-so received, as if counting treasures, making it hard to disbelieve, and even harder not to sigh! It is precisely for this reason that I admire Guangxi's political democracy...</p>
<p>Getting Back the Investment Recently, the provincial government announced a list of over forty heads of county tax collection offices. One of them told the reporter, "I don't expect to make any money, just to get back my investment." The implication was bewildering at first, almost making me think I had misheard. But after careful consideration, I suddenly understood. Doing things is one thing, and "being a person" is another. When one cannot have both fish and bear's paw, who would not give up the fish for the bear's paw? Therefore, doing things and being a person are "no big deal." As long as one can put in the investment, one can generate profit on top of that, and that's all there is to it!</p>
<p>New Tricks The one who loves to play fresh and foolish tricks the most, many people would unanimously nominate "none other than the Relief Sub-Office." Muddled to the extreme, and rotten to the core! Here, there is no personal prejudice on the part of the author; it is the unanimous view of the people of Guangxi. Facts are facts, and a flowery work report cannot stand if the facts are brought out.</p>
<p>The recent "broken rice case" that caused a sensation in Guilin is another good show put on by the Relief Sub-Office. On the second of this month, the Sub-Office transported fifty tons of "Japanese rice" to Guilin. It allocated thirty tons to the Municipal Labor Relief Committee for the implementation of "labor relief." The people were delighted when they heard the news and were almost ready to sing and dance. But when they opened the rice bags, they wondered if the Relief Sub-Office was afraid that the refugees would not digest whole grains, or if they had mistaken white rice for flour? Thirty tons were all stinky and moldy "rice flour!" Checking the other twenty tons, they were also a mess. How could they be cooked, how could they be eaten? The Labor Relief Committee was puzzled and simply returned the shipment, politely declining. The Relief Sub-Office's storage and transportation station saw that things were not going well and, perhaps because it had something on its mind (it is generally estimated that if good rice were used for a "bait and switch," fifty tons could yield a net profit of twenty million yuan), or perhaps because it knew something, simply transported the rice away, planning to sell it elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation This incident immediately aroused public outrage. The Labor Relief Committee immediately asked the police to guard the storage station's warehouse. However, the storage and transportation station was sometimes "wise and anticipated the problem before it arose" and had already moved all the rice away. This caused a public uproar, with everyone demanding a thorough investigation to see if the refugees should be eating stinky rice flour of unknown origin! All the newspapers in Guilin mobilized to attack the issue, determined to get to the bottom of it. Various government agencies also sent staff to inspect the warehouse, and they brought back a bag of stinky rice with the official ruling: "It is already rotten, as broken as chaff, and unfit for consumption." The High Court also sent staff to investigate, preparing to file charges. Heads of relevant agencies visited Chairman Huang, who expressed his concern... A series of cannons frightened the Relief Sub-Office. As a result, there were repeated calls for a "thorough investigation!" Who knows, the investigation may end with "there was a reason, but no evidence was found," lightly dismissed without resolution. Someone suggested forcing the colleagues of the Relief Sub-Office to try the stinky rice for a month, but this would probably lead to "emotional involvement." It is precisely: "Stinky rice should only be eaten by refugees, how can the Relief Sub-Office get a taste of it!"</p>
<p>Reducing Loan Quotas The people's view of relief work is simply that it is "a boring farce." For example, when distributing winter relief supplies, some people received a glove, and some people received a rag. How could they not be annoyed and amused!</p>
<p>To return to the topic, what can bring joy to the people is not a nondescript relief effort, but the news that the central government has reduced Guangxi's borrowing quota by 500,000 dan, the most fortunate gain from countless requests. In addition, it is said that after the counties report the actual disaster situation in detail, the tax and purchase quotas may be reduced accordingly. When the news came, everyone smiled and said "Amitabha." The wise central government saw the suffering in the hearts of the people of Guangxi, and the people of Guangxi wept for joy!</p>
<h3>Ambassador Stevenson in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Liang Feng, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Guangzhou</p>
<p>In recent months, so many unfortunate incidents have occurred one after another between Guangdong and Hong Kong that the people of Guangzhou cannot suppress their sad and indignant emotions. This bad atmosphere has greatly hindered the prospects of Sino-British friendship. Although British Ambassador Sir Stevenson's visit to Guangzhou this time is in a professional capacity to visit the Guangdong provincial authorities and inspect the British community, his arrival will be enough to ease this bad atmosphere.</p>
<p>Answering Five Questions at the Reception for Southern Journalists</p>
<p>During his visit to the south, in addition to official visits to the military and political authorities here and giving lectures at Sun Yat-sen University and Lingnan University, the British ambassador also hosted a reception for a group of journalists. At the reception, the ambassador answered some questions raised by the journalists: (1) His opinion on the recent Wang Shuixiang and Zhang Tianxiang cases in Hong Kong, (2) The progress of the Sino-British trade agreement, (3) His views on the current commercial situation in China, (4) The difficulty for overseas Chinese in Burma to enter the country, and (5) Whether the United Kingdom will participate in the mediation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Among these questions, the one that the general public here is most concerned about is, of course, the Wang Shuixiang and Zhang Tianxiang cases, but in the eyes of the ambassador, they are not as serious as we see them. He said that these are just small things, and it is inevitable that such things will happen in Hong Kong, which has a population of more than two million. The British government has already provided considerable compensation to the relatives of the deceased in the Wang case, and the Hong Kong government has also consulted with the Guangzhou authorities on the Zhang case, but has not yet received a reply. He emphasized that the spirit of British law requires substantial evidence before a defendant can be convicted, so it takes more time for thoroughness, which is the biggest reason why it cannot be resolved quickly. He also said that the news media must report these events truthfully and not deliberately exaggerate them to promote Sino-British friendship between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The ambassador may think that the news media here is "deliberately exaggerating" and ignores the fact that all of this is the opinion of our general public and the most truthful reporting of the news media.</p>
<p>Sino-British Trade Agreement to Be Signed Based on Reciprocity</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Sino-American trade agreement, the Sino-British trade agreement is also worthy of everyone's attention. The British ambassador said that the draft agreement was sent to the Chinese government in June last year. In November, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added China's opinions to the draft agreement, which was forwarded by the ambassador to the British government for study. It is believed that it will be signed soon. This trade agreement is based on the international reciprocal trade agreement. It is estimated that the United Kingdom will also receive the same benefits as the United States. If the conditions proposed by the United Kingdom are not included in the US trade agreement, the United States can also request it in the future according to the regulations. Conversely, China can also request it from the United States. The ambassador also said that China and the United Kingdom may also sign an aviation treaty based on reciprocal relations.</p>
<p>Transportation, Monetary System, and Politics Affect Business Development</p>
<p>Regarding the current dismal situation of Chinese business, the ambassador's view is that the main problems are the difficulty of transportation in China and the instability of the monetary system. At the same time, if China's political problems are not resolved, business cannot develop. However, the ambassador is still very optimistic about China's future. He believes that China's political problems can certainly be resolved. Here, someone mentioned the question of whether the United Kingdom will participate in mediating the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The ambassador said that the United Kingdom has not considered it. He believes that Chinese affairs should still be resolved by the Chinese themselves. If foreigners can help, then Ambassador Stuart is the most suitable candidate.</p>
<p>The ambassador also admitted frankly that British business is currently facing some difficulties because 80% of British industry was converted to wartime industry during the war. Now it will take two or three years to return to peacetime industry, so the United Kingdom is currently unable to supply China with what it needs. He hopes that the supply to China can be gradually increased in the future. The British business delegation's visit to China has shown the United Kingdom's concern for Chinese business. Their report will be completed, and it is believed that it will contribute to both China and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Chinese and Indian Residents Still Being Refused Entry by Burma</p>
<p>As for the Burmese government's refusal to allow overseas Chinese to return to Burma this time, the ambassador's answer was that the Burmese government is not refusing overseas Chinese to enter the country. The reason is that Burma was devastated after its fall, and everything has not yet recovered. Therefore, the Burmese government is unwilling to allow a large number of non-Burmese people to enter unless it can be guaranteed that they are self-sufficient. Because 12,000 overseas Chinese are still stranded in Guangzhou, but this is not only the case for overseas Chinese, but also for 400,000 Indians who want to enter Burma, and there is no way. The ambassador also said that he had consulted with the representatives of the Hong Kong United General Association and asked them to find a way to send them away.</p>
<p>Finally, the ambassador talked about the issue of Sino-British cultural exchange. He said that the British Council will send representatives to Guangdong in the future to maintain regular contact with our cultural authorities.</p>

<p>Although running a newspaper is a well-known endeavor in China, few understand how to manage and develop such an enterprise. Everyone is content with knowing *what* to do, without seeking to understand *why*. Consequently, success is often accidental, while failures are numerous. This is entirely due to a failure to learn from the experience of predecessors. For those who wish to start a newspaper but are unsure of how to do so effectively, and for those who want to enter the newspaper industry but don't know where to begin, I would like to sincerely recommend reading Mr. Zhan Wenhu's "Newspaper Management and Administration."</p>
<p>This is a highly practical book. For those with the ambition to join the newspaper industry, this book provides encouraging inspiration. For those already engaged in the industry, this book offers powerful guidance. In the first chapter, "Background of Experience," the author cites the stories of many newspaper people, offering encouragement for continuous effort. Stone's policy of honesty, Nelson's dedication, and the arduous struggles of Ochs and Lord Northcliffe all serve as valuable "stones from other hills." In the second chapter, "Creating Your Own Enterprise," Mr. Zhan sincerely offers invaluable experience to those aspiring to work in the newspaper industry: (1) You must create a distinctive feature to achieve a "catching up from behind" impression, and (2) Cultivate your reputation with an honest attitude and a spirit of service. To illustrate these two points, he uses the story of the New York *Globe's* struggle as an example, demonstrating that a new newspaper willing to be original and sincerely serve the public can certainly find a way to succeed and achieve a position of catching up from behind.</p>
<p>The author insists that a newspaper must maintain a distinctive feature as its weapon to "stand out from the crowd." At the same time, he also argues that a newspaper should possess a courageous sense of justice to guide society toward the right path. He cites the New York *Globe's* clean food campaign and the *China-America Daily's* campaign against traitors as examples. These two movements had a tremendous impact on society, and these two newspapers also succeeded. Regarding other secrets of running a newspaper, the author points out "attracting readers" and "understanding readers." He believes that newspapers, in order to obtain more and newer information, should not hesitate to spend heavily on assigning reporters to work in various locations. He agrees with Mr. Chen Bosheng's advocacy of employing more reporters, believing that even if these people do not write a single word, as long as they are engaged in the work of gathering information, they are good. He also believes that the most important thing for a newspaper's managers is to understand their readers and value their interests and benefits. He quotes Mr. Stone, believing that "readers are more valuable than advertisers, and the status of readers is higher than that of advertisers." This opinion is still a valuable lesson in the current Chinese newspaper industry.</p>
<p>Starting with the third part of the book, "The Way of Organization," the author elaborates on "Principles of Distribution," "Newspaper Advertising," "Typesetting Problems," and "Financial Principles," offering many opinions. Although these chapters may seem a bit specialized to ordinary readers, the consistently engaging writing style and the down-to-earth and insightful views will keep you reading in one breath. For readers engaged in the news business, these chapters should be carefully pondered and studied in detail. For example, in the area of distribution, the book provides many specific and effective methods for organizing news vendors, strengthening promotion, and attracting readers. In the area of advertising, the book pays special attention to classified ads, and suggests many worthy-of-emulation methods, and also emphasizes the training of advertising staff, which is a problem neglected by newspapers across the country. Regarding "Typesetting Problems," the book also reviews many technical issues, with special insights into the arrangement of Chinese characters and the management of ink and paper. Although it may be just a few words, obtaining this experience can save a newspaper a lot of waste each year. "Financial Principles" is the last chapter, and also the most difficult to write. Few people in China study this issue, because almost all newspapers lose money. When losses occur, publishers try to make up for them by borrowing and patching together, without regard to the two words "financial management." Mr. Zhan has received materials from the Inland Daily Press Association of America for comparison and reference, establishing a designed budget for Chinese newspapers, stipulating some accounting items as a basis for Chinese newspaper operators to follow. Among them, the chapter "How to Deal with Emergency Situations" can provide valuable reference for many Chinese newspapers with no economic foundation. In short, this book is worth consulting for anyone interested in the news business, and it is worth reading for those who want to start a newspaper but are unsure of how to do so effectively, and for those who want to enter the newspaper industry but don't know where to begin.</p>
<h3>On Emotions</h3>
<p>— Naya</p>
<p>William James, Translated by Tang Yue</p>
<p>The Commercial Press, First Edition, Year 35 of the Republic</p>
<p>Anyone who pays attention to psychology, whether in the fields of philosophy, sociology, or medicine, will know about James's "theory of emotion," right?</p>
<p>James's theory occupies an important position in the history of psychology. He prompted more research on emotions by later scholars, leading to greater progress. His fundamental standpoint still lies in James's theory.</p>
<p>"On Emotions," "On the Stream of Thought," and "On Habit" are the three most popular and historically valuable chapters in James's "Principles of Psychology." "On the Stream of Thought" has already been introduced in the publishing world. Now, I am introducing "On Emotions" to all readers.</p>
<p>Firstly: It provides precise explanations of emotions such as sadness, fear, hatred, and anger.</p>
<p>Secondly, it derives a question from the classification of emotions: How did any existing "expression" of anger or terror develop? This question concerns physiological mechanisms on one hand, and historical truth on the other. This question is difficult to answer, and the author provides various interpretations.</p>
<p>The author's explanation: First, it verifies the difficulty of this question in terms of experiments, and then considers various refutations. This consideration fully explains from all sides, and also clarifies the question.</p>
<p>As for "subtle emotions" and "crude emotions," many examples and explanations are also given regarding: joy, affection, ambition, indignation, and self-esteem, which are also expressed by feelings of emotional pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>"There is no brain center dedicated to emotions." It makes its own conclusions by comparing various fields of knowledge.</p>
<p>Differences in emotions between individuals. It also discusses various differences such as "spread excitation," "adaptation," "lingering," and "attendant."</p>
<p>Finally, it explains the origins of various emotions, explains its topic in more detail than before, and raises many questions, answering them. This allows readers to gain a deep understanding.</p>
<p>In short, James's writing is not "plainly stated." He cites opinions from all sides, merges them into one, and then makes a full and precise explanation.</p>
<p>The translator also made many annotations to help readers understand easily, making it easier to understand difficult places.</p>
<p>"On Emotions" is a book that everyone must read to cultivate their body and mind and understand the development of psychological emotions.</p>
<h3>Atlas of Chinese Climate</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yifan</p>
<p>Drawn by Lu Wenfu, published by the Central Meteorological Bureau</p>
<p>Topography and climate are two major natural factors in the human living environment. Topographic maps and climate maps are essential reference materials for formulating all economic construction plans. Without these maps as a basis, the plans must be completely empty and impractical, and impossible to implement. China's topographic maps have been sufficient for application since the publication of the *Shenbao's* *New Map of China*, *New Provincial Maps*, and *Large Wall Maps*. However, there are still no complete and exquisite climate maps. In the past, although there were some scattered climate illustrations in the publications of the Meteorological Institute of the Academia Sinica, the Chinese Meteorological Society, and the Xujiahui Observatory, they were fragmented, and because too few records were collected, there were many unrealistic aspects, especially the maps published by the Xujiahui Observatory. Isotherms and isohyets often disregarded the influence of topography, crossing mountains and ridges, which did not conform to climatological principles. It goes without saying that it was difficult to rely on them. Until the recent publication of the Central Meteorological Bureau's *Atlas of Chinese Climate*, we finally have a relatively reliable climate map.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lu Jiong's preface at the beginning of the collection, the records used in the map are entirely those collected by the Meteorological Institute of the Academia Sinica and the Central Meteorological Bureau over the years. Because the length and timing of records in various regions varied, they also underwent a series of sorting and correction work. The breadth of the collection and the precision of the drawing can be imagined. However, in China, where meteorological records are scarce, especially in the mountainous areas of the west, there are certainly many doubtful places. At the same time, because the printing is slightly poor and the proofreading is negligent, there are quite a few small errors. Moreover, each map does not have a single word of explanation, which is hoped that it can be corrected and supplemented in the reprint.</p>
<p>The entire collection contains a total of ninety-six maps—one to thirteen maps are surface pressure and wind direction maps for the whole year and each month. Fourteen to seventeen maps are cyclone frequency maps for the four seasons. Eighteen maps are the number of thunderstorm days for the whole year. These eighteen maps can roughly represent the outline of surface atmospheric circulation and atmospheric disturbance activity in the East Asian region. Although the relationship with practical applications is slightly less, it is an indispensable basic map in climatology. Isobars are spaced at two millimeters, and wind direction is indicated by arrows, which are clear. It is a pity that wind force is not indicated, and the quantitative aspect is unclear. If the length of the arrows could represent the wind force, it would be even more perfect. There are no upper-air current maps, so there is no way to see the whole picture of atmospheric circulation, which is a pity. However, it is thought that this is due to the lack of upper-air records, so we can only find ways to supplement it in the future.</p>
<p>The second part of the atlas is all about temperature. The quantity is heavy and it is quite complete. There are thirteen maps from 19 to 31 showing actual temperatures throughout the year and each month. Five maps from 32 to 36 showing sea level temperatures for January, April, July, October, and the whole year. Four maps from 37 to 41 showing annual diurnal range, continentality, and spring and autumn temperature differences. Two maps from 41 to 42 showing absolute temperatures. Three maps from 43 to 45 showing frost period. There are twenty-seven maps in total, a magnificent view. In terms of drawing, it is much more accurate than the temperature maps published in the past. The side-by-side arrangement of actual temperature maps and sea level temperature maps takes into account both climatological theoretical research and practical application, which is a major feature. The frost period map is very important for agriculture and deserves special mention.</p>
<p>The thirteen relative humidity maps for the whole year and each month from 46 to 58, the thirteen cloud cover maps for the whole year and each month from 59 to 71, the six sunshine maps for the whole year and each season from 72 to 77, and the fog and haze days maps from 78 to 79 form the third part of the atlas, totaling thirty-four maps. Humidity, cloud cover, and sunshine maps are important references for studying agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and medicine and health, while the distribution of fog and haze days is directly related to aviation and navigation. However, for application purposes, two more annual fog and haze days variation curve maps should be added to complete the whole picture.</p>
<p>The fourth part includes sixteen maps of rainfall, rainy season, rainy days, and variability, etc. The maps from 80 to 92 are rainfall distribution maps, drawn according to the whole year and each month, taking into account the influence of topography everywhere, which is quite ingenious. The isohyet interval is also very appropriate, the interval is a multiple of twenty-five, and the conversion to inches is very convenient. The rainy season map of 93 divides the country into thirteen regions according to the month in which the rainfall peak and sub-peak appear, which is concise and to the point. However, there seems to be only one map for the whole year for rainy days and rainfall variability maps, which is not enough. At least four seasonal maps should be added, because these two climate factors are very important in agriculture.</p>
<p>The fifth part is the Chinese climate zone map of 96 maps. Although there is only one map, it is a summary of the aforementioned 95 maps. The zoning seems to be based on the Koppen classification method and then further subdivided. Each zone is marked with the letter symbol of the Koppen classification. People who study climatology can of course know the climatic characteristics of each zone at a glance, but for the convenience of other people, detailed explanations should be added.</p>

<h3>Reading "A Nest of the Gentry"</h3>
<p>— Du Ruo</p>
<p>In the summer of 1858, Turgenev, tired of touring Western Europe, returned to his country. The serf life under Alexander and Nicholas Russia was nakedly displayed in front of him; the complacent words of the frail and incompetent old new party members stimulated him; the memories of youth lost in middle age and the mood of the setting sun hurting him.</p>
<p>Thus, after four months of hard work, through his beautiful writing style, "A Nest of the Gentry" was produced. The strong atmosphere of French Romantic literature, Pushkin's poetic purity, Gogol's satire and abundance, combined with the author's own lyricism and melancholy, were tempered into a great work of gray and gloomy "legendary style."</p>
<p>This novel depicts its theme from the side, the unique thoughts of that era, the narrow nationalist view of Slavism, overcoming the symbol of truth, the great and loving humanism; this obviously violated the author's original intention. Turgenev, a stubborn Westernizer, should have extremely supported the latter, but loyal to the ideas of the times, he did not hesitate to let the former win.</p>
<p>Its content is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Lavretsky, a progressive Russian landlord, went to Moscow to study after his father died? In the first two years of entering university, he only met one classmate, Mikhailovich.</p>
<p>One evening, Lavretsky met a girl, Warwara, in the theater and fell in love with her beauty. Finally, through Mikhailovich's introduction, they became acquainted, fell in love, and got married.</p>
<p>The happy newlyweds traveled around Germany and Switzerland and came to Paris. Warwara's artistic talent, beauty, and social skills made her a wonderful flower in Parisian high society, known as a stunning Russian beauty? Lavretsky himself buried himself in books. He originally planned to travel to Baden-Baden in Germany with his wife, but an unexpected accident overturned all his plans.</p>
<p>One day, Warwara was not at home, and Lavretsky accidentally found her infidelity to him in her private room; in a rage, he fled to Italy and hid himself in a small city. He learned from the newspaper that she had gone to Baden-Baden, and later learned that they had a daughter. Then, scandalous news came one after another, and Warwara became a "celebrity."</p>
<p>Four years of drifting life passed, and he returned to his homeland to cultivate the land, and went straight to his hometown to sort out his industry. And he visited a relative, his cousin Maria, and aunt Marfa, the second-generation widow of the Kalitin family, but he did not want to fall into love again, entangled and unable to extricate himself.</p>
<p>He fell in love with his cousin Lisa Veda, a pure, pious, and kind girl, the most perfect female type in Russia. His kindness and enthusiasm finally won the girl's heart. At the same time, there was a vulgar official, Panshin, a distorted Westerner, who was also pursuing Lisa by relying on Maria's favor. They were extremely incompatible and argued sharply. Because of the conceited tone of the vulgar official, she was disgusted, and his contempt for Russia hurt her heart; Lavretsky's defense of Russia further promoted her love for him. So, one night, in the Kalitin garden, they kissed each other, the first kiss, which was also the most decisive kiss.</p>
<p>Then misfortune came to his head again, his wife Warwara, who was rumored to be dead, suddenly arrived with their young daughter. Maria orchestrated a "broken mirror reunited," and he was forced to admit reconciliation with her, re-cohabiting, and forgiving her, entirely for the sake of their innocent child.</p>
<p>The next day, Sunday, in the morning, Lavretsky ran to the church and finally found Lisa after the Mass. She was satisfied that he had fulfilled the common obligation she had put forward, reconciling with his wife, and of course, guaranteed fulfillment. Another part that belonged to herself was the decision not to marry Panshin; at the same time, thinking that happiness was in the hands of God, she decided on "self-sacrifice" and said "farewell forever" to Lavretsky.</p>
<p>That winter, Warwara betrayed her husband again, captured Panshin, and moved to St. Petersburg. The following spring, news came that Lisa had veiled herself in the B Monastery, located in the most remote corner of Russia.</p>
<p>Eight years later, Lavretsky went to O City again in the spring and revisited the Kalitin family. Many of the former owners were dead, and what replaced them were joyful young people: those happy, fleeting memories that never returned threw him into a heavy sense of loss. Later, although he also visited the monastery where Lisa was hiding, and saw her, he could not catch a glimpse of her.</p>
<p>After reading this story, it can be seen that the author uses a plain and fruitless love as a context to fully express the perception of the heroes of the transitional era: giving the departing era a final gaze and mourning, and welcoming those new young people who are the drivers of the wheels of history.</p>
<p>Lavretsky was hit hard and fought back to cultivate the land. Shouldn't his strong and resilient Russian national character give us purely empty talkers a sharp warning!</p>
<p>Lisa is a devout religious believer. Her enthusiasm for religion surpasses everything in the world, even the highest inspiration between human sexes, love; withdrawing from the circle of happiness, her self-sacrifice fully expresses the spirit of Christ's love.</p>
<p>What about Warwara? Romantic things, art, literature, philosophy, and music have all become her tools of communication. Only in the vulgar Panshin does she have supreme, irresistible authority over him without any real responsibility.</p>
<p>"A Nest of the Gentry" is worthy of being called the crystallization of art.</p>

<h3>Old Shoes</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chuanwen</p>
<p>The old shoes have been placed in the corner of the house for more than half a year. They are with the dustpan, broom, and uncleaned garbage. The dust on the shoe surface is piled up very thickly. The straps are untied, and it is unknown whether a mouse has bitten off half of them, leaving only a very short section exposed on the edge of the shoe opening. Except for the thick, intact, and like-new rubber sole, which can still evoke memories of its past glory, the impression it gives is one of decline and fall, like an aging and faded prostitute who, in her lonely and desolate twilight years, has been unfortunately abandoned. The open shoe opening is even more like a lonely and helpless mouth, silently sighing.</p>
<p>Obviously, these old but not broken leather shoes have now completely lost their owner's favor.</p>
<p>So, in these lonely days, the old shoes can only comfort themselves by recalling the past.</p>
<p>It was in an old city on a plateau, known as the "Mountain City" because of its rugged and mountainous terrain. Among the famous mountain cities in the southwestern plateau provinces, this city can indeed be called a typical mountain city. Every three or five steps, there is either a large slope or a small slope. The houses and streets in the city are all built on the hillsides and at the foot of the mountains, following the uneven terrain. Therefore, people living in this city must have a pair of strong and agile feet and a spirit of enduring hardship. That is indeed true. The people who originally lived in this mountain city had already developed this kind of training due to generations of living there. As for the people who came from other places, in order to adapt to the environment, they were all influenced by this spirit of perseverance. Whether they were young masters and young ladies from the most pampered families or tycoons who were used to enjoying luxury, once they arrived in this city, they had to train their feet to be able to climb slopes and mountains. Perhaps it was because of this precious and unyielding spirit, which symbolized the resistance of the Chinese people against violent aggression, that this city became the heart of China's resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, due to the needs of the people and the environment, a kind of sturdy and durable leather shoe that could withstand the threat of the rugged terrain of this mountain city came into being—these old shoes belonged to a pampered young lady with a noble status.</p>
<p>When China's War of Resistance was in full swing, this mountain city was gathering patriotic and steadfast people from all over the country. Every corner of the mountain city was filled with the passionate fighting spirit emanating from the hearts of these people. Because people were engaged in active resistance work, old shoes and their companions became the pets of the people of the mountain city at that time, striding proudly and actively on the slopes and streets.</p>
<p>At that time, the old shoes followed their owner from morning till night, running around the mountain city, because the owner was also one of the ardent patriots. On sunny days, the dust on the streets and slopes flew like fog, and people had to cover their noses to walk. The old shoes were covered in dust. On rainy days, the streets of the mountain city were really difficult to walk. The streets were full of deep mud. People relied on their strong legs and ran with great effort, covered in sweat. At this time, the old shoes and their companions could really show their skills. It was thanks to them that they could climb and run freely on those slippery and dirty mud roads. Therefore, although the old shoes looked a bit bulky and ugly, they were sturdy and durable, so they were happily worn by the people of the mountain city.</p>
<p>However, the old shoes' misfortune finally arrived.</p>
<p>Since the news of China's victory in the War of Resistance against Japan shook this mountain city like a thunderbolt, people, after a moment of excitement, returned to their respective homes. Soon, the old shoes followed their owner to Shanghai, a famous metropolis in China.</p>
<p>At that time, the old shoes and their owner were so excited that they almost shed tears.</p>
<p>However, before long, the old shoes, like many people who longed for victory, were disappointed. Once in Shanghai, they lost their owner's favor and were abandoned.</p>
<p>Replacing them was another favorite, a pair of bright red and brilliant glass slippers.</p>
<p>The new favorite was indeed beautiful, with a thin and light sole, and the shoe surface shimmering with dazzling brilliance, like wearing two flowers on the feet, adding a bit of beauty and liveliness to the owner. This was something the old shoes sighed was beyond their reach.</p>
<p>But the old shoes did not despair because of this. They still harbored a extravagant hope, perhaps a naive idea. They thought that although the glass slippers were more beautiful and attractive than themselves, they might not be as sturdy and durable as themselves. Perhaps that was their advantage. Once the owner discovered this advantage, perhaps they would change their mind. Therefore, the old shoes often comforted themselves with this, waiting patiently, day after day, always hoping that one day they would regain their past favor.</p>
<p>Every morning, when the owner wore the brand-new and beautiful glass slippers out the door, or when they came back from outside at night, the glass slippers always showed an arrogant look as they passed in front of the old shoes, emitting dazzling flashes and loud noises.</p>
<p>Although the old shoes regarded this arrogant attitude of the glass slippers as an insult and felt angry, they still tolerated it, pretending not to see it. But what made them feel most sad was seeing the owner's happy smile when wearing the glass slippers (which clearly showed how much they loved this new favorite), and they could no longer bear it. They sighed sadly and finally shed tears.</p>
<p>"Am I doomed to despair from now on?"</p>
<p>When the old shoes waited for their owner's favor in the corner of the house day after day, and were disappointed day after day, they sighed like this.</p>
<p>Then one day, the old shoes saw their owner hurrying out, and then hurrying back a little later, followed by a buyer of old goods. The owner didn't say much, took the old shoes out of the corner of the house, and threw them into the old goods dealer's basket.</p>
<p>The old shoes immediately knew what was about to happen, knowing that they were truly abandoned by their owner. They saw that there was no trace of pity on their owner's face, so they were angry, cursing, trying to struggle and resist, wanting to shout loudly, wanting to break free from the old goods dealer's hands.</p>
<p>When all efforts were in vain, the old shoes had no choice but to lie silently in the basket, entrusting their fate to the old goods dealer.</p>
<p>The old goods dealer arrived on the street, and the old shoes were suddenly awakened by the noise of the street. They opened their eyes and looked out from the basket. This time, they truly saw Shanghai: prosperous, lively, and new. It seemed that everything was different from their hometown mountain city. At least, they couldn't see so many glittering things on the streets of the mountain city. The old shoes were dazzled and couldn't even recognize what these glittering things were. They only saw that people's heads, bodies, hands, and feet were all shining brightly, dazzling the eyes. When the old shoes calmed down and looked carefully, they were greatly surprised. It turned out that glass slippers like the ones worn by their owner could be seen everywhere on the street. This was no different from encountering an enemy, and they were so angry that they almost wanted to roar.</p>
<p>Indeed, there were many things in the world that the old shoes' simple mind could not understand. Why were they abandoned by their owner once they arrived in Shanghai? Why did people change once they arrived in Shanghai? These questions lingered in the old shoes' mind, and they couldn't figure them out.</p>
<p>Later, the old shoes finally thought of some irrelevant things that seemed to answer those questions, but also seemed impossible. They thought that they couldn't smell the clean and fresh air of the mountain city in Shanghai, they couldn't see the boundless sky of the mountain city, and the wildflowers blooming everywhere. Because of these things, they began to dislike Shanghai for no reason and miss the mountain city. They loved that mountain city, loved the quietly flowing river there, loved the grassy slopes there, and even loved the cold fog in winter and the scorching sun in summer.</p>
<p>Now, lying in this cold basket, the old shoes cherished the soil brought from that mountain city that remained on their soles. This made them even more nostalgic for the past days. It was truly a dream, a distant dream!</p>
<h3>Idle Talk on Couplets</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>Li She of Min County (Zongyan) was the grandson of Grand Scholar Shen Wen Su. When Wen Su was defending Guangxin, he went to Hekou to raise military funds. The Hong Yang army suddenly appeared. Lady Lin wrote a bloody letter to the Zhejiang General Rao Tingxuan for help, and held the seal by the stone next to the well, vowing to coexist with the city. Rao led his troops in the rain and lifted the siege. Forty years later, Li was appointed as the prefect of Guangxin and brought his mother, the Dowager Lady Shen, to the yamen. He built the Baojing Hall and inscribed a couplet: "Three hundred miles from Wuyi, pointing to the distant home mountains, welcoming the litter carriage, still the kind mother's teachings under the green lamp. Forty years after Grand Scholar Wen Su, temporarily holding the county seat, stroking the remaining steles, ashamed of having no extempore writing like my maternal grandson."</p>
<p>When Ni Bao Cen was defending Jingzhou, he wrote a couplet for the Yamen Hall: "Ask who has the talent of Yima, please try ten thousand words, absolutely not allowing an inch to be gained before the steps. I wish to advise each other to stop the pig-herding game, practice diligence in everything, and carefully value every second of the world." The first line is from Li Bai's letter to the governor of Jingzhou, and the second line is about Tao Kan's defense of Jingzhou. The local scenery is truly a wonderful saying.</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Jie Ding</p>
<p>The small steamer traveled all day and did not feel tired. Its speed in the Huangpu River was even faster, constantly hitting the waves of the river. Looking out from the ship's window, I saw planes with red and green lights taking off and landing at Longhua Airport; we passed by the American battleships, and the sailors were laughing; avoiding the river reefs with flashing red lights, rows of foreign buildings with bright square windows were receding; gradually I could see the big clock on the Jianghai Customs. Then we arrived at the corner of the Bund Park. It was a quiet winter night on the Bund. Next to it, the cars on the Waibaidu Bridge flashed back and forth like shuttles.</p>
<p>"Arrived," everyone stretched their tired bodies and hurriedly tidied up their belongings and changed into clothes for landing.</p>
<p>"We arrived at seven o'clock, this ship is considered fast." People said. I looked outside, and the clock on the Jianghai Customs was showing exactly seven o'clock.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ship turned outwards, the engine room's motor had stopped temporarily, and the ship swayed drunkenly. Some people grabbed the window sills.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"We can't get in, the ships are so crowded." The boatman on the ship said.</p>
<p>The boatman was poling and shouting, and the large wooden boats were slowly drifting outwards, the masts and ropes were in a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>"Hold on, hold on!" The boatman saw a wooden boat ramming sideways, quickly jumped over, held his own boat with both hands, and pushed his feet hard to push it away.</p>
<p>"Damn it, are you blind?"</p>
<p>"There are so many ships, how can you let it go?"</p>
<p>People on the ships were cursing each other, not knowing which ship it happened on.</p>
<p>I stuck my head out to take a look, it was really busy! Many people were scrambling to drag the poles and run on the ships. The entire Wusong River was full of wooden boats. The sailors on the wooden boats near the shore were eating under the lamplight as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>With a "thump," a bamboo pole suddenly poked over, right on the window sill I was leaning on. I quickly pulled back my protruding body.</p>
<p>The ship was closer to the Bund Park. Under the round lights at the corner of the park, a man and a woman were embracing; two people wearing peaked caps were leaning on the iron railing watching the ships. The dark yellow river water was rushing against the collapsed stone embankment. Behind us were two more steamboats pushing our butts, the ding-dong bell rang, the motor stopped and started, the heavy sound of ships colliding, mixed with shouting, clamoring, bamboo poles, river water... The river surface was as noisy as the Joint Commercial Market in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Trams, cars, and trucks on the Baidu Bridge rumbled brightly, "Du-ba!..." Various horns honked, "Woo!" The warships in the Huangpu River roared angrily.</p>
<p>One by one, large wooden boats, empty and full, people running, masts and planks in a mess, spewed out from the Suzhou Creek, slowly, endlessly.</p>
<p>A square landing craft rushed up from behind, the motor vibrated and rattled, "Woo woo" loudly, "Get out of the way, get out of the way!" The sailors on the boat shouted loudly. The wooden boats squeezed out a gap with great difficulty, the ships were even more chaotic, and the sound of collisions was even louder. The boat squeezed into the river, and the wooden boats closed in again, slowly poling and poling outwards endlessly.</p>
<p>The embracing couple in the Bund Park had already left, and there were three people wearing peaked caps, gesticulating as if they were just talking about something. The blood-red cigarette fire shone on the inky black figure. The round lights in the park never moved. The Broadway Building with its blocks of light squares stood tall in the dark sky, drawing an even darker scissor shadow. The Huangpu River had been made into a dark shadow by the wooden boats. The Suzhou Creek was still spewing out endlessly...</p>
<p>Finally, the boat in front moved, our boat also started its motor, and the river seemed to be a little looser. Looking at the clock on the Jianghai Customs, the long hand was still pointing at twelve, but the short hand had already reached nine. We could faintly hear the sound of the bell ringing, and a large string of steamboats and wooden boats followed behind our boat.</p>
<h3>Feeling Inspired on the First Day of the Dinghai Year</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>In my declining years, I am still experiencing the Dinghai year again. When I first entered the Dongshu school, things were just like that. In that year, I learned poetry and knew the Great Odes, but now I am afraid of the boundless laws. A crude official is caught in the cycle of poverty and success, and is still confused about the past. Why should I cherish the rest of my life like this? I will change the connection and follow fate.</p>
<p>Note: The previous Dinghai year was the thirteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. The teacher first entered the school to receive books, and began to read poetry from the Wen Wang section of the Great Odes. The poetry classic was published in two volumes, and the second volume was the Odes and Hymns. One year later the second volume was finished, but the first volume, although not read, could be recited easily. It was because a classmate was reading the first volume, and the teacher could recite it at the same time. In this way, the entire Book of Songs was completed in one year. Huan Ji is a name translated by the teacher from both sound and meaning, to correct the errors in names such as "Logic" or "Nomenclature". It has long been agreed upon and become a convention.

<h3>Napoleon Visiting the Plague Victims</h3>
<p>— Gros</p>
<p>Gros (Baron Gros 1771—1835) was considered one of David's more influential students. He began studying painting at the age of fourteen and was valued by David from a young age. Later, he was summoned to the palace by Napoleon as the court painter. His works mostly praised Napoleon's achievements. His style differed slightly from David's, and the unrestrained passion in his colors and composition greatly influenced his younger brother, Delacroix (leader of the Romantic school). This work depicts the hero Napoleon conquering Italy, visiting the plague victims after the war. The original is very large and is now in the Louvre Palace in Paris. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Sail</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dun</p>
<p>——A sail is poetic, giving people wisdom</p>
<p>The sail, full of wind and waves, full of sunshine, drifts on the boundless ocean...</p>
<p>The sail carries full of sorrow, full of joy, from the ends of the earth to the corners of the sea, like a wandering singer who has experienced the vicissitudes of life, tired of this unstable life, longing for a happy and tranquil harbor. But the sail is destined to be a wandering destiny. After a thrilling voyage is completed, it approaches the familiar shore, and a new voyage awaits it. In order to ferry more people to the other shore they aspire to, the sail once again carries everyone's hopes and ideals, leaves the quiet harbor, leaves the shore that has comforted its hard work and knows its pain, and goes to the sky to meet the full sky of wind and waves!</p>
<p>The sail sways with silver shadows on the vast blue lake, comparing its beauty with the white clouds in the sky. The sail shadow is like a beautiful dream. On the river bank greened by the spring breeze, the sail reflecting the sunshine is so young, giving people encouragement and life force. The sail shows you forward, forward, towards the place you yearn for.</p>
<p>In front of the window facing the river, a sail shadow will take you into the painting; on the misty Jialing River, when you see a sail, you know there are people on the same journey as you, and you will not feel lonely. On the treacherous beach, beside the ferocious cliffs in front, a sail shadow fluttering will reduce your fear, knowing that the beach cannot stop the sail from moving forward, and that there is a wider road ahead!</p>
<p>Those who are not content with their own warmth and fullness, but pursue more happiness for the majority of people, those who are not content with the hardening of their hearts, but are always searching for newer things, will all be lovers of sails, and they are all stubborn sails in the sea of people!</p>
<p>The sail is poetic, and the sail gives people wisdom.</p>
<h3>The Moon over the Songhua River - Random Memories from the Tong Window, No. 5</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>Is there no beautiful scenery outside Shanhaiguan? If you think so, why did the war break out from that place? In fact, the three northeastern provinces are a good place. The winter in the north will especially show the greatness of the north. From Dalian, take the train on the South Manchurian Railway, next to the heating pipe, through the double glass, looking out from the window, it is a piece of white snow. Except for the snow, you can't see anything else. The particularly small moon hangs high in the cold sky, shining on the silver-plated earth. It is the scenery of "the cold sky shines on thousands of miles, ice and snow cover the mountains and rivers." What a large piece of land this is! From Dalian to Shenyang, the train takes a day and a night. From Shenyang to Harbin, to Changchun, Jilin, there are even longer distances, more places, thicker snow, and colder ice. On this vast land there are forests, coal mines, gold deposits, soybeans, and sorghum. The moon illuminates the vastness of this land.</p>
<p>But the most interesting thing is the moon over the Songhua River. The name "Songhua River" is so beautiful. Is it a river where the flowers from the pine trees float on the water? If you think so, then it must be the flowers from the pine trees on Changbai Mountain, floating along the river. But that's not the case. The beauty of the Songhua River is on a moonlit night. Outside Jilin City, between Nanshan and Beishan, the water of the Songhua River flows through here. This place has the name "Little Jiangnan". Why wouldn't there be spring outside Shanhaiguan? In the spring, this place is full of flowers, green trees swaying in the wind, and the ice and snow have all melted away. People seek pleasure in the suburbs, and the Beng Beng Opera and the drum performance are art that is often appreciated by the public. The language spoken here is better than in other places</p>
<h3>The Yellow River - Random Memories from the Tong Window, No. 6</h3>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, I took the Jinghan train across the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Because the bridge's insurance period had expired, the train carefully and slowly drove across. Sticking my head out of the window, I could overlook the famous Yellow River. But the Yellow River is not as wide as the Yangtze River, nor does it have as much water. The riverbed is piled with sand and mud, like countless islands, and the water flows turbulently in the sand seams. This sand is often rolling in groups and constantly changing its position. Therefore, the Yellow River is really not a suitable waterway for navigation. Otherwise, why are there no ships speeding in the Yellow River? In places where the water is deeper and there is less mud, a Yellow River ferry has formed. Here, people and objects can be transported by civilian boats, but the boats can only find waterways to walk through the sand seams. Groups of people pulling ropes work hard on the sand dunes to help those who are poling, walking as smoothly as the boats in the Yangtze River. Except for the lower reaches, there really isn't any on the Yellow River. Therefore, the Yellow River is not necessarily a river that is conducive to transportation. Conversely, sometimes, when the water comes from the upper reaches quickly, and the lower reaches are full of sand and mud, the water will break the river堤, which becomes the "Yellow River disaster." I lived in Kaifeng, on the edge of the Yellow River, for some days. Kaifeng is still not flooded, which is an unexpected luck. People can see that the terrain of Kaifeng is much lower than that of the Yellow River. The tip of the iron tower, a relic of the Jin Dynasty in the city, is often below the water level of the Yellow River. If it breached, the people here would become fish and turtles. During the late Qing Dynasty, the government specially set up a "River Terrace" for the Yellow River, spending a huge amount of national money every year to repair the river堤. There were frequent breaches. Since the Republic of China, this official position and funding have been abolished, but the Yellow River has not breached. Please think, what is the reason? Some people once suspected that officials often made the Yellow River unleash its power in order to justify the use of that huge amount of money. Later, since this money was abolished, people no longer had any ideas about the Yellow River. Over the years, there has also been the establishment of the "Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission" here. Many people disassembled this title to read: "Yellow River water, profit for the committee members, association." But fortunately, the Yellow River does not breach much, because it is possible to receive funding even if it does not breach, which shows that democratic countries are really much better than monarchical countries.</p>
<p>The Yellow River does not deliberately make things difficult for people. It is still people who cause it to breach. Historically, for the sake of war, people often breached it, so the Yellow River often changed its course. During this War of Resistance, the Yellow River changed its course again. For the Yellow River, it is also a kind of pain!</p>

<h3>Frequent Aerial Mishaps and Discussion of Parachuting Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Air transport is inherently very safe, and parachuting requires prior training, so ordinary passenger planes are not equipped with parachutes. However, recently air transport has been plagued with misfortune, with accidents happening in the East and the West. If you have some parachuting knowledge, it seems you'll be better off than others!</p>
<p>Parachutes come in various types such as "seat pack," "backpack," "chest pack," and "chest-backpack." The seat pack is for pilots, while the chest pack is more suitable for passengers. Before boarding the plane, the straps should be put on, and the straps around the thighs should be tightened. When standing straight, if it feels too tight, it will be just right when sitting down and parachuting. Both the parachute and the straps are marked with small colored strips, red matching red, yellow matching yellow. If mismatched, they cannot be fastened. When boarding the plane, carry the parachute pack in your hand, and after boarding, keep it close to you. It is best to carry it with you when moving around in the plane, so you don't have trouble finding it in an emergency.</p>
<p>In an emergency, the pilot determines that the aircraft has a malfunction, and the mechanic cannot repair it in the air, or the fuel is exhausted, and the terrain is not suitable for a forced landing, so an abandon-ship signal is issued, either by radio broadcast or by red light. Passengers prepare to jump, fasten the parachute pack to their chest, and open the cabin door. There is an emergency opening method, marked in red. If this method is followed, the cabin door will detach from the aircraft. Those sitting near the door should jump first, without rushing or pushing. There are various opinions on parachuting methods, but they all emphasize a few points. First, the legs should be together, not apart, so that the body forms a pendulum in the air, preventing excessive rotation. Second, the hands should be placed on the chest. This not only reduces resistance, allowing for a quick exit from the aircraft, but also keeps the parachute's pull handle right in front of the chest. As long as one is mentally clear, one will definitely be able to find the pull handle. After jumping out of the aircraft, a calm person will certainly see that they are a considerable distance from the aircraft before pulling the handle forcefully. The parachute will then open. Pulling it too early can cause the parachute to become entangled in any drooping part of the aircraft, which is very dangerous!</p>
<p>Floating like an immortal, if the parachute is shaking too violently in the air, you can use the parachute's risers to adjust it, changing the shape of the parachute and maintaining its stability. Generally, people are absolutely clear-headed in the air. When approaching the ground, you must fall with the wind. Practicing somersaults in the military is an essential skill for parachuting. Those who can do somersaults and those who can do the "hanging hair" move in Peking opera are less likely to be injured upon landing. When I was at the Williams Flying School, the parachute instructor compared the landing posture of parachutists to that of a drunkard, which was very apt.</p>
<p>The packaging and storage of the parachute are prerequisites for safety. Every few days, it must be opened, dried, and repackaged. The person responsible for packaging must sign on a card. If the parachute fails to open during a jump, the packer is responsible and can be severely punished. Parachutes must not be stained with oil or water, and must not be used as cushions in the airfield or in the aircraft!</p>
<p>The material should ideally be domestically produced silk, and imported materials should be nylon (commonly known as glass silk). The number of warp and weft threads per square inch and the tensile strength are all specified. The carrying capacity of this type of parachute is about dozens of times the weight of a person, so it is absolutely safe to land and there is no risk of rupture mid-air.</p>
<p>Parachute material is the best quality of silk and is suitable for women's formal wear. I have several classmates who survived parachute jumps during the war in Europe and used their parachutes to make their new wives' wedding dresses, which was novel and unique, and also implied a beautiful story of heroes and beauties.</p>
<h3>Sweet and Delicious, Endlessly Useful - Casual Talk About the Omnipotent Sugar</h3>
<p>— Cheng Cong</p>
<p>In wartime, sugar is an extremely important raw material for military industry. Without alcohol, synthetic rubber would fail, and the production of alcohol requires large quantities of sugar. There are also other military needs, from small K-ration boxes to hundreds of types of paint for battleships, all requiring huge amounts of sugar. In 1944 alone, military confectionery consumed 100 million pounds of sugar.</p>
<p>Now that the war is over, sugar is still scarce. To understand the reason, our attention cannot be limited to candies, ice cream, and sweet wines. Before the war, sugar was as unremarkable as water. Although 15 percent of a person's energy relies on sugar, most people are not very clear about sugar and do not know what it is actually used for.</p>
<p>Besides being the most economical source of life, sugar has other extremely important uses. In the eyes of chemists, sugar is like a magic wand, with endless types of chemical products, all requiring sugar as a manufacturing material. Thousands of tons of sugar are used in pharmaceuticals and dyes, and hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar are absorbed in the manufacturing process of paint and soft glass. For this precious sugar, there is not a week without new needs emerging, and these new needs are all the masterpieces of scientists in laboratories.</p>
<p>The Age of Sugar - Sugar manufacturing experts believe that before the atomic age, we have already entered the age of carbohydrates. They predict that in the near future, large amounts of super-fuel will be made from sugar or sugar by-products to supply cars and airplanes.</p>
<p>Sugar is truly the storage of sunlight, and it is the packaged heat supplied by nature. In green leaves, sunlight combines the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans with water to produce sugar, which is the basic chemical of human life and the element on which human survival depends. No other compound can store the power of sunlight for human use at any time.</p>
<p>This secret method of nature absorbs and preserves the heat emitted by the sun on the earth. The total amount of heat stored in sugar on earth each year exceeds the heat emitted by burning 300 trillion tons of coal.</p>
<p>It is commonly believed that sugar is the sweetest substance, but this is not the case. It is almost at the bottom of the list of sweeteners. Substances like saccharin, although not as palatable as sugar, are 300 times sweeter than sugar.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that there are two kinds of plant-based sugar: one extracted from sugarcane and the other extracted from sugar beets. The method of making sugar from sugar beets was not known until 200 years ago. In 1747, Dr. Marggraf of the University of Berlin in Germany was the first to invent this method.</p>
<p>During World War II, sugar substitutes appeared in the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture produced a special apple pulp for household use. It has an amber color, tastes unlike apples, but is very sweet and has the advantages of sugar.</p>
<p>Vast Demand - Besides being eaten during meals, used to make candies, and ice cream, sugar has many other uses. It plays a role in the manufacture of high-strength cement, penicillin, paper, explosives, and synthetic rubber. Large amounts of sugar are used in the manufacture of nylon fibers. It can prevent extremely fine fibers from sticking together when they are first made. Many high-quality gasolines are now also made with sugar. In addition, the manufacture of blood plasma, soft glass, and leather, and the preservation of meat, all require sugar. Sugar is also very important for the preservation of tobacco. It can make the flavor of tobacco particularly fragrant, and it can also be used to make glass. Several important substances, such as lactic acid, acrolein, and citric acid, are also made with sugar as a material.</p>
<p>In addition to pharmaceuticals, dyes, paints, and fuels, there are endless products coming out of chemists' sugar bowls. Sugar is still the most economical and powerful food for humans. The heat emitted by one pound of sugar is equal to ten times the heat of one pound of spinach. One penny's worth of sugar provides 270 calories of heat, while one penny's worth of meat provides less than ten calories.</p>
<p>Sugar is a product of nature, it has a future, it has production, and it is extremely related to human welfare and cultural progress. The future demand will definitely increase day by day.</p>

<h3>Easy to Form, Easy to Break - Sorrow, Joy, Separation, Reunion - Reno, The City</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>The name of "Divorce City" Reno has long been known all over the world. Even wives brought back from foreign countries by GIs, when they discover their husbands' embarrassment or have other affections, will go to Reno to live for six weeks and file a divorce complaint with the court.</p>
<p>Reno is a small city in Nevada, but at the train station, a line of words is written: "The biggest little city in the world"! According to Nevada law, one only needs to reside in the state for six months to obtain citizenship. However, even faster, one can file for divorce after only living there for six weeks and making a showy oath.</p>
<p>Usually, divorcees arriving in Reno often look very sad. Unless they (three-quarters of the people going to Reno for divorce are women) have friends there "waiting out the time" or are genuine locals, no one is at the train station to greet them—except for a suave gentleman she doesn't know who immediately introduces himself as a local lawyer.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about anything now." His opening line is often like this. "You'll love it here, I'll take care of everything."</p>
<p>He will indeed take care of everything. And the lawyer's bookkeeper will temporarily write "everything" on the bill, the amount depending on the divorcee's situation—roughly from 350 US dollars to 100,000 US dollars. Women who obtain huge alimony payments are the best clients for lawyers.</p>
<p>The first step is for the lawyer to solve her accommodation problem. Because accommodation solves not only the problem itself, but also confirms that she lives in Reno. She may live in Reno's most fashionable "Riverside Hotel." Maybe she lives in a small house next to a beautiful ranch, spending six weeks fishing and hunting. If she is prestigious, rich, or has other outstanding qualities, the lawyer will not let go of the "God of Wealth" and will welcome her into his own home, treating her as an honored guest. When Barbara Hutton, the heiress of the Woolworth fortune, came to Reno to divorce, her lawyer vacated his own house, sent his family on a "vacation," and rented it to his client for $3,000 a month.</p>
<p>How did Reno become "Divorce City"? It happened in 1900, when a lawyer named Peer Schmitz in Reno placed advertisements in film manuals, newspapers, and magazines across the United States:</p>
<p>Do you want a divorce? "Please read Nevada's divorce laws. Do you have family disputes? Do you want a divorce? Do you want a quick and reliable lawsuit? Please notify me"!</p>
<p>As a result, divorce cases flowed to Reno like a tide. However, lawyer Schmitz was deprived of his lawyer's license because of this. But this was only a face-saving measure by the Nevada government at the time, which was more conservative. Schmitz was later allowed to appear in court again.</p>
<p>Divorce cases not only made lawyers rich, but also made the Reno court's annual surplus considerable. Apart from divorce lawsuits involving child adoption or alimony adjustments, other divorce lawsuits, no matter how far-fetched and trivial the reasons, are granted without exception.</p>
<p>When the six-week "statutory time" expires, the usual litigation procedure is as follows: In the morning, the plaintiff submits the complaint to the court. Lawyers and witnesses are all present. When the court session begins, a whole set of reasons such as "mental abuse" are brought out, and at the same time, a "permanent residence" "oath" must be sworn. Although Reno's settled population does not increase because of this, the judges still solemnly and without guilt listen to this kind of formulaic oath. Later, the judge pronounces the verdict, which is almost always "divorce granted."</p>
<p>In terms of the number of divorces and marriages, Reno should be praised as "Marriage City." Because the number of marriages in the city each year is actually more than the number of divorces. This phenomenon seems a little strange at first glance, but on closer inspection, it is indeed reasonable. Because most divorcees already have new partners beforehand, and once they are free from the "old person," they immediately combine with the new person. Two divorcees can become four married people, so marriage actually exceeds divorce. In addition, since Nevada has no legal restrictions on the date of re-marriage, anxious re-marriers from other states flock to Reno to obtain re-marriage qualifications. As a result, there are even more marriages than divorces. The difference between the two was as much as five to one, which happened in 1939, with 11,061 couples married and 2,231 divorces approved by the court.</p>
<p>What kind of city is Reno itself? It is like other small American towns. The settled people live normal lives and are not disturbed by the city's "marriage trade." Reno has its schools, churches, golf courses; it also has its celebrities, bankers, brokers, lawyers, cowboys, and college students. One thing that distinguishes Reno from other American cities with 25,000 residents: Reno has the opportunity to see how those "temporary neighbors" live, quarrel, drink, and cry. From these tragic examples, Reno has become a more stable city that is not very influenced by those who come and go.</p>
