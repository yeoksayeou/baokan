<p>今天是「五一」勞動紀念日，自一八八六年以後的第六十二次勞動紀念日。紀念勞動用「五一」，乃產業革命以後，歐美勞工拿鬥爭流血那天來紀念不忘的意思。這個紀念日，在國際勞工陣容上的意義很大，他們以此目標，要求勞動人們的團結，爲生存競爭而奮鬥，具有社會進化的使命。社會進化本是和平演進的，惟有共產黨錯覺，認社會進化，必須經過階級鬥爭和流血，所以半世紀以來，國際共產黨爲莊嚴的「五一」，塗上了鮮紅的血跡。這個紀念日，在中國有其偉大的意義，中國民族精神是和平團結，中國社會糾縱沒有階級對立，自與歐美情形逈然不同。我們中國很重視勞動，因而同樣重視「五一一勞動節日，在今天，不僅勞動的人們，熱烈迎接這一偉大紀念日，就是全體中國人民，無分男女，無分階級，亦莫不熱烈迎接這一莊嚴的紀念日。</p>
<p>中國民族是世界最勤苦的民族，此種動苦的精神，便爲勞動的發揚。中國自古卽尊崇勞動，視勞動爲美德，先哲的垂訓，見之典籍者，禮日：「先勞而後祿；」易兌曰：「說以先民，民忘其勞。」管子曰：「以勞敎民富；」論語曰：「有事弟子服其勞。」說明了中國是講勞動最早，並以勞動鼓勵後世立國立身，所以淸儒顏習齋說：「一身動則一身强，一家動則一家强，一國動則一國强。」我們的國家，不但素來重視勞動，且重視勞動後的安樂。看農曆的節日：春景怡人，有淸明郊外掃墓的紀念日；初夏入倦，有端陽競舟紀念日；秋高氣爽，有中秋賞月紀念日；嚴冬方過，小陽春轉，農事休暇，有元旦到元宵的休養和慶賞。這是很好的啟示，給予勞動的人休憇，鼓勵勞動的人同享同樂。如若和今天勞動節的起源比較，可知我們的紀念勞動，基於歷史源流，基於社會習慣；非爲某一階級，非爲鬥爭流血，希望紀念勞動節的人們，明白認識這一點。</p>
<p>我們國家重視勞動，紀念勞動節日，是爲了全人類的和平幸福，爲了全社會的進步，創造一個幸福康樂的境界。不幸經過大戰後，人們生活艱苦，工商凋零，失業危機日趨嚴重，致各種社會問題，相繼而起，個人的生活，社會的安定，感受重大威脅，因之我們在今天，紀念勞動節的今天，提出當前兩大重要問題，社會問題與勞工問題，要求政治家法律家的重視，要求社會人士的認識。</p>
<p>解決社會問題的方策，應講求社會安全；解決勞工問題的方策，應講求保護勞工。試觀近年歐美各國政府，無論行政司法，對於社會安全保護勞工事項，莫不詳加籌劃，一反從前保護資本家主義，而爲保護勞動家主義。我國本以勞動立國，今天處此時代，內察國情，外瞻趨勢，對於此兩大問題，自應深切注意。今年元旦頒佈的憲法，其第十三章基本國策，提出了社會安全和保護勞工的政策，這是一種極遠大的國策。惟憲法的規定，限於原則的列舉，具體的實施與細目，猶待立法上完成法律，行政上再循此以進，纔能收穫良好的效果。我們以爲：社會安全不僅注意社會保險，社會服務，並要注意充分就業。保護勞工，不僅注意工廠檢査，工資調整，勞資協調，並要注意工作時問的合理，撫卹，娛樂制度的確立，纔算進步的立法。能這樣，所謂社會問題勞工問題，自然不會存在或發展。能這樣。也啟示了我們的重視勞動，始終一貫。</p>
<p>總之，「五一」勞動節，是神聖莊嚴的紀念日。它的意義隨社會進化而日新，它的使命隨和平幸福的生活而增進。「五一」勞動節，永遠是新的，永遠是神聖莊嚴的節日！</p>

<h3>聯大指導委會一致能通過　英國提案列入議程　主張設立聖地調查委會　阿拉伯集團要求遭拒絕</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約弗魯辛草地廿九日是電〕聯合國大會指導委員會本日舉行會議，當即一致同意將英國建議列入大會議程，並提交政治委會審議。是項建議主張設立調查委員會，負責研究巴勒斯坦問題，並在聯在奉於九月間舉行會議時，提出各種建議。至於阿拉伯方面所提出之要求，主張將英國停止代管巴勒斯坦及巴勒斯坦之獨立兩項問題列入大會議程，則為指導委員會所拒絕。</p>
<p>〔合衆社弗魯辛三十日電〕五阿拉伯國家要求終止英國委任統治及巴勒期坦獨立，侃使聯合國特會立即加以討論之努力，今日似已成失敗之局。由於指導委員會準備於今晨十一時（上海時間爲今日午夜）重開，獲得蘇聯支持之英美代表團，似在十四國之指導委會中，集中充分力量，擊敗阿拉伯國家使巴勒斯坦成爲獨立國家之要求。蘇聯業已不支持阿拉伯集團，雖蘇代表葛繩米柯對該集團使巴勒斯坦成爲獨立民主政府之目的，表示同情，此一行動再加以拉丁美洲各國之轉變，進而支持美國之領導，實際上已使阿拉伯集團之動議，當指導委會今日屆投票通過時，可保證其必遭失敗。目前祗有埃及與印度兩國必然投票贊成在議程上加入委治與獨立問題·蘇·美·英·加·巴西·捷克·及赤道國等業已宣佈反對，波蘭雖表示贊同，但將對投粟棄權。伊拉克·黎巴嫩及沙地阿拉伯，雖能出席有發　權，但無表決權。</p>
<p>阿拉伯集團結成一致陣綫，各國之聲明，論調頗爲一致，綜合其要點約有下列三項：（一）國聯盟約中允許甲級委治地之人民最後獨立，由於英國對巴勒斯坦之委治屬於甲級委任統治，故巴勒斯坦之自由實繫於英國，蓋巴勒斯坦之準備獲得自由，正如過去其他同屬於甲級之委治國家，如叙利亞·黎巴嫩·外約但及沙地阿拉伯然，已屬不庸疑問之事。（二）除非聯合國迅加處置，目前巴勒斯坦之恐怖份子騷動，在九月前勢將蔓延至近東與中東。（三）當巴勒斯坦業已被承認屆獨立之時，拒絕其獨立，實違反委治制。阿拉伯國家繼續結成一致陣綫，昨夜阿同盟之黨團討論如渠等之動議失敗時，阿拉伯代表團是否可能投票反對成立一調査團。蘇聯與波蘭表示贊同充分討論委治與獨立問題如阿拉伯人之所要求者，惟兩國又同時表示，渠等寗願在調査後而非調査前，對此問題再加以辯論。可能爲大多數意見所擁護之美國立塲，則爲一切國家皆深盼巴勒斯坦獨立，但對於應採取之獨立方式，阿拉伯人與猶太人之間仍有衝突意見存在。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾接見奧斯汀　美反對猶代表有發言權</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務院發言人稱：馬歇爾國務卿定明日與美駐聯合國機構代表奧斯汀晤談，討論聯合國機構政策及特別全體大會就巴勒斯坦問題之辯論，奧斯汀定今夜離紐約來京。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約三十日電〕今日可靠消息，聯合國特會討論巴勒斯坦問題時，美代表團反對准許任何猶太代表出席發言，除非局勢有意外變化。據美代表團之意，聯合國機構旣以國家爲單位，故僅國家代表有權出席大會發言。猶太團體如有意見，祗可書面提出，或列席調査委會備詢。</p>
<h3>聯大開會期間　猶恐怖黨休戰</h3>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷廿九日電〕猶太官方稱：巴勒斯坦之猶太恐怖團體伊爾根黨及史德恩黨，在美國猶太人之壓力下，已同意在聯合國召開特別全體大會期間，停止對英軍採取行動，然該兩猶太恐怖團體刻猶未曾宣佈此意。</p>
<h3>英埃間爭議　埃擬訴諸安理會</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅廿九日電〕埃及總理諾克拉希頃宣佈；聯大特別會議討論巴勒斯坦問題之後，，埃及即將英埃爭議提交安理會討諭。謂美不惜採取片面行動</p>
<h3>杜勒斯報告　外長會經過</h3>
<p>謂美不惜採取片面行動</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿九日電〕馬歇爾國務卿之　　顧問即共和黨要人杜勒斯，隨馬卿莫斯科歸來，今日發　廣播演說，報吿四外長會議經過。據謂：此一會議對於將來美國外交政策之確定，至少已有所貢獻，莫斯科會議對於重要問題所由不能成立協議，由於蘇聯之態度使然。依照蘇聯之計劃而復興之德國，不僅存便德國成爲高度工業化國家之危險，同時亦有使德國成爲蘇聯工塲之虞。蘇聯之理想倘付之實施，奧地利將淪爲傀儡國。美國代表團此次在莫斯科已與法國樹立更密切之關係，美國將來不惜採取片面決定，此舉似爲謀歐洲福利所必要。</p>
<h3>美蘇租借帳目</h3>
<p>美僅欲蘇淸償一部份</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿九日電〕關於蘇聯淸償美國租借法債務一事，頃據此間消息靈通人士談稱，美國在戰時租借與蘇聯之物資，總値一百十萬萬美元，美國要求其濟償，僅其中之一小部份。凡純屬軍事性質之物資，或在戰時被毁壞者，均不欲償還，而所要求償還者，厥爲工業物資，現由蘇聯用作實施其五年計劃者，估價據値約四十五萬萬美元云。</p>
<h3>參院外委會一致通過　美國外救濟法案　衆院擬將其減少至二萬萬美元</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿九日電〕關於美國以三萬五千萬美元，救濟中·希·義·波·匈及奧等國一項法案，頃由參議院外交委員會開會加以討論，當即獲得一致通過，事後據該會主席即共和黨參議員范登堡吿報界稱：特里埃斯特區亦在此項救濟計劃範圍之內。此外又悉：衆議院外交委員會開會討論此項救濟法案時，共和黨衆議員强克曼曾提出一項修正案，主張將救濟款項减少至二萬萬美元，當即以一百六十五票對一百卅八票獲得通過。若千衆議員意欲將蘇聯所支配各國之救濟，加以限制，但外交委員會仍拒不接受此項要求。預料參議院將設法使此項救濟計劃，恢復杜魯門總統馬歇爾國務卿及國務院帮辦克萊登提議時之原來狀態。</p>
<h3>美援土協定　不久可簽訂</h3>
<p>美以航空港出售予希臘</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿九日電〕墨西哥總統阿爾曼來美訪問，本日抵此，社魯門總統曾親往歡迎，並表示兩國關係友好，足以證明泛美洲主義在精神上之力量，同時亦足以證明西半球各國均能和平解決一切爭端云。阿爾曼總統當即答稱：墨西哥人民深信民主，此項民主思想，已使美墨兩國人民團結一致云。</p>

<h3>報告莫斯科會議經過　馬歇爾演辭全文（續）</h3>
<p>外長會與會人員顯然都贊同建立一自足自給而且民主之德國，並加以種種限制，防止德國重新建軍。</p>
<p>德國政府權力不宜過份集中</p>
<p>中央政府問題——德國未來政府中央化的程度，是一個極其重要的問題。諒德國那樣的國家，個人權利與會社權利，傳統上缺乏足够的力量，可以控制政府的權力運用。如果權力過度集中的話，那是非常危險的。　蘇聯似乎贊成强有力的中央政府。美英兩國反對這類性質的政府，因爲這太容易轉變爲類似納粹集團的統治。英美贊成中央政府的權力範圍有嚴密的限制，其他權力保留給各州或各省。至於法國的主張，中央政府只能具有非常有限的責任。他們害怕希特勒政權在一九三三年攫奪國家大權的把戲，會重演於明日。</p>
<p>在尋常的情形下，各國對政府改組的性質，總有强弱不一的意見。但是在這種情形下，又參雜了一些對德國軍事力量再生的合理恐懼，以及對別有居心公開或隱蓄的慾望的焦慮。</p>
<p>德國的經濟關於德國經濟制度的性質及其對歐洲的關係，各種異議甚至更爲嚴重而難以調整。目前德國的經濟，因爲沒有統一的行動，所以弄得殘廢不全，而且欲使德國重建到自給自足的地步，也需要立即決議。</p>
<p>對於德國經濟統一的願望，各方一致宣佈同意，可是等到討論管理這種統一的實際條件的時候，又各執一見了。在覓取經濟統一的努力中所遭遇到最嚴重的困難之一是蘇軍佔領區內的一意孤行，毫不職慮到別的佔領區，而且蘇軍佔領區內所發生的一切情形，即使有報吿，也很少。他們毫無合作的意向，而且拒不宣佈糧食的情形和蘇軍佔領區內取走的賠償的程度與性質。</p>
<p>德境經濟合併蘇聯不願合作</p>
<p>蘇方無意和我們合作，按照波茨坦協議建立一平衡的德國經濟，是實現自足自給德國和能够以煤斤及其他必需品供應其毘隣各國的德國的最大阻力。按德國各鄰邦的煤斤及其他必需品原多仰給於德國。英美兩國曾爲此而極力爭取蘇聯合作，結果是徒然的，英美兩佔領區遂爲改善德國的經濟局面而合併，這就是允許兩佔領區物資及生產品自由流通，以收調劑之效。這種合併曾遭蘇方無情的抨擊，認爲這是違反波茨坦協議和分裂德國的步驟。蘇聯拒絕實施該協議，就是促成合併的惟一原因，但是蘇方竟未能瞭解此點。我們只好作如是觀：蘇方的抨攀除了掩護他們未能履行波茨坦統一德國經濟協議的事實外，別無其他意圖。我們若有某些走向德國經濟統一的步驟，總較全然沒有強勝多多，這是無可置疑的事。</p>
<p>管制魯爾工業區（歐洲的最大產煤區及重工業區）的性質問題，仍是辯論的對象。我們不應僅僅爲了獲致協議就對之有所決定，因爲極重要的考慮之點和未來的結果都和它有關。（待續）</p>

<h3>改善計算指數　謀取澈底解決　吳開先水祥雲表示意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先，總工會理事長水祥雲，昨曾分別與記者談及生活指數問題。</p>
<p>擬就腹稿·留待採擇</p>
<p>吳局長稱：渠抱有絕大決心以求澈底解決，勞資評斷會小組會已定於五月三日開會，屆時將邀工業協會，市商會，總工會等有關團體列席參加。席間將徵詢每一出席者對此問題之意見，加以整理後再召開一次會議，決定擇一方案建議中央採納。屆時谷部長如仍在滬，當請其出席會議。吳局長並稱：外傳擬將計算差額金之日用品種類增加，渠並未考慮及之。吳局長稱彼已擬就腹稿，待谷部長來滬後當與硏究商討，待中央採擇，目前不能公開發表。</p>
<p>建議覓取·民主方式</p>
<p>水祥雲稱：解凍指數，就大體觀察，已勢所必然，惟若欲全部解凍，則尙屬不可能。目前各方對此問題之意見可歸納爲：（一）底薪在五十元以下者恢復指數，五十元以上者以折扣計算。（二）生活指數以一月份八千倍爲基數，再就各業情形分別依折扣發給。（三）舉行階級調查，分別評定各業工資。（四）增加差額金計算物品之種類。至中央究擇何種辦法以補救工人生活，尙在未定。總工會囚鑒於勞資雙方與政府處境不同，各有苦衷。各方皆主觀談話而忽視客觀之條件與環境。故建議社會局召開一政府，資方，勞方三方面之談話會，以民主方式謀取解決。蓋目前工人不能維持生活，一部份工廠將宣吿關門，以及政府處境之艱苦皆爲事實。吾人何不推誠佈公，互覓解決之途徑。此項建議社會局已加採納，待五月三日勞資評斷會對解凍指數問題開曾後，再召開此三方面之談話會。屆時勞資雙方各有十餘代表參加，政府方面出席者則爲各主管機關首長。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕吳局長昨與記者談：‘造成物價漲跌之因素爲原料，銷路，生產率，利息及工資。故工資祗爲物價之一小部份，如生活指數自一月份之七千九百餘倍，突然恢復至目前應得之倍數，渠認爲不致刺激物價。而物價則絕對足以決定工資。</p>

<h3>侯家浜少婦飮刃慘死</h3>
<p>情變釀成命案　凶犯許阿奎即被捕　詳供經過情敵在逃</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕城內侯家浜吳家弄典業公所卅八號門首，昨日上午十時半左右，有一少婦被殺於該處，事後邑廟警分局長沈德亭陳景珊據報，親率刑事股長周南，股員買文林，警長白發祥，便警顧志誠，李學維，居斌，章明輝，陳裕志及福佑路派出所巡官楊以義等，將該處四面包圍搜抄，卒將兇犯許阿奎拘獲帶局。</p>
<p>據供：死者聞順娜，吳江縣震澤鎭人，二十六歲，鄕間有夫名許金生，務農爲生，與渠</p>
<p>私姘</p>
<p>約有十年，渠曾　此賣云田二畝，船一艘。本年二月間，相偕來滬，因覓屋不易，渠住城內吳家弄三十九號同鄕人沈和生家，以販大頭菜爲生。死者則受僱於方浜路證祥里二十七號爲女傭，兩人仍時相探晤。有在平濟利路二四六號開設談茂興砧　店之老闆娘談費氏，與沈和生之妻某氏係姑嫂，時常往來，死者因而得識該一一嫗，談得投機，經談婦將死者引誘與其子談連倩發生關係，日久彼渠十分氣忿。最近因販</p>

<p>且邀死者聞順娜亦列席，講斷關係。後聞對方邀有自相人在，因此裹足。詎談費氏聞順娜談雪倩（店中伙計）忽偕兩西裝百分乘街車至沈和生家，向渠理論，死者態度強硬，使渠怒更難遏，交涉數分鐘，遂邀死者外出談話，甫至弄口馬路側，即出利刃（淸晨向晏海路張大隆剪刀舖出資五千元購得之水菓刀一柄）</p>
<p>猛戳</p>
<p>死者左乳旁一刀，嘴部一刀，當時死者會負創奔跑五六步，卒因傷及要害踣地殞命。同時渠即拔足圖逃，被談雪倩等追捕，警察旋亦來包圍致無法脫身。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎大晚報代表楊思奇夫人，以「週遊歷國尋求理想夫婦」爲主題，昨在蘭心大戲院公開演講。</p>

<h3>思南路看守所　人滿為患　罪犯突增多　囚糧起恐慌　正向社會局洽購中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市思南路看守所，自本年一月下旬辦理大赦後，獄中原有囚犯赦釋二分之二，最少時僅剩七百四十九人。惟入春以來，犯罪者突然增多，經大赦出獄之罪犯，頗多因再度犯案，而陸續歸來，截至昨日止所中共收容囚犯達二千另七十三名，已超過大赦前之數目。所有牢房均已滿額，而平均每日仍有五六十名新犯不斷送來，囚房已不够分配，故新入獄者，祗好權在走廊中安身。問題之尤嚴重者，囚糧亦將不敷。所長田立勛昨吿記者稱：所中現有米糧僅够維持今日一天，明天即有無米爲炊之虞。田所長曾於前日赴市社會局訪吳開先局長，申請配購紅秈米一千祖，以供應看守所，臨時看守所，上海監獄及高院臨時看守所等四機構。昨日又與社局糧食科吉明齋科長接洽，因米糧價格連日狂漲，社局正擬將現有存米大量拋售，以謀抑平，故對囚糧一千担是否能全數核准尙不可知。惟據田所長表示，雖不能全數配購，少數總須應酬，斷糧慘劇或尙不致發生。田所長並吿知每名囚犯，每天給糧二十兩，目前約每日消耗食米十七担餘，並謂此次之缺糧，因大赦後人數减少，未曾多備，而此半月來囚犯人數突然增多後，適逢糧價暴漲，致造成空前缺糧現象。照所中糧賬，早已顆粒無存，今尙有剩米，乃爲上月結存之餘糧。又稱，幸囚糧費用可依實報銷，否則將無法籌措矣。</p>

<p>比賽於七時三十五分方開始，雙方初上塲陣綫與第一次比賽時相同，觀衆頻頻催戰，掌聲與呼聲齊起，接觸之下，美國隊勃羅齊愛許即得五分，中華方由陳學崇於左角投入一球，勃再來犯，竟無人看守「寫意」投中一球，特林華繼之九比二，中華不得不重整陣容，乃由蔡演雄易替劉福善，中華形勢漸呈好轉，但犯規多次，悉被對方罰入，十五比六劉蔡再度對易，包松圓增三分，美隊停戰，吳成章試擲命中，十七比十三，愈覺接近，白勞福調愛許十五分鐘時陳學崇得震中之良好接濟成十九比十八，僅差一分矣，美軍再停，愛許復入，合作佳妙，頓添七分至二十六，觀衆均爲中華隊担憂，上半時三十比廿一，美國隊領前九分之多。休息時市長盃給獎，市長未到，由交際科長張彼得代表，男組冠軍哥倫布隊由勃羅齊受領，全隊笑口皆開，對銀盃表示珍視與歡欣。</p>
<p>下半時開始，老包於本籃下截得勃羅齊高球，運球傳蔡演雄，蔡立傳學崇命中，動作淸脆，三于觀衆莫不滿意，三十三比二十五時，震中易福善，勃魯齊大約翰的飛奔，使中華諸將目爲之呆，三十九比二十六中華第五次暫停，愛許的靈活有時二個人都難軋住他，記分牌上電鐘正指在三十分鐘時比數爲四十九比三十二，林維聰代蔡演雄，馬燦希代陳學崇，中華分數經林李等急追頗有起死回生之姿態，五十三比四十四奧勃林「畢業」，小約翰替之，任章松圓學崇老包等苦鬥成五十三平手，時存最後二分鐘，吳成章一球反超出二分，愛許成五十五平手，大約翰犯規成章罰一分，學崇擲中，反成五十八比五十五，體育館空氣狂熟小約翰中籃，增至五十七，蔡演雄最後一球，比賽完畢，中華遂以六十比五十七反敗爲勝。</p>

<h3>產區報漲生產量少　食油創新高價</h3>
<p>本廠豆油狂跳三萬元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日食油行市，繼續猛烈騰漲，各檔食油，均創新高價。本廠豆油五十八萬元，漲三萬元。靑島吉普桶生油六十萬元，漲二萬元。凈生油五十五萬元，漲二萬元。又產區價格，亦繼續報漲。無錫六十三萬元，常州六十二萬元，靑島四十三萬元。營口雖較賤，惟運輸困難，且即有裝出，亦多運往華北天津一帶供銷。本市各民營油廠，俱感原料缺乏，以致生產量少，售出額當亦更少。如照目前原料價榨油，則榨油所得，只够抵付原料成本，而工繳開支，一切無着。蚌埠漢口等地，原料貨品較次，面售價反昂，更屬無法採用。</p>
<p>食油商擬組聯營處</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市食油商業同業公會以近來滬市油價騰漲，食油聯配處無能爲力，爰擬組設食油聯營處，並已呈請吳市長備案，計劃中之食油聯營處，將以食油公會全體批發組會員爲基幹，以零售組會員爲對象，額定資本十萬萬元，分等認股，分期繳納。嗣後所有中植油廠以及本市民營廠所產食油，槪擬由該公會聯營處遵照議價承購，按期配給全體零售組會員，曁醬園業醬酒業兩公會會員。如遇不足時，儘由批發組會員負責販運，以期充實云。</p>
<p>聯配處將擴大組織</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會第四次會議，對穩定滬市食油價格，決定上海配售食油，由經部中國植物油料廠。糧部中國食油公司。及榨油業同業公會。組設統一配售處。昨以經物字第一六號代電，請市府査照辦理。社局主管利定於週內，將食油聯配處予以擴大組織，統一登記零售商號。聯配處及中植公司現所配售之零售商號共一千八百家，加以審核後，將裁減至八〇〇家云。</p>
<p>東北大豆日內可到</p>
<p>又訊：中信局與各銀行共同負責在東北採辦之大豆第一批六千噸，日內即將抵滬，聞該批大豆，係專供滬市油廠榨油之用云。</p>
<p>又悉：中信局對國外成交之大豆貿易，迄僅兩筆。一係意大利，數額一萬三千二百噸，一係荷蘭，數額五千噸云。</p>
<h3>來源枯竭到貨稀寥　米價再見高峰　麵粉雜糧均直綫上漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」米，豆，麵粉，雜糧昨日一致瘋狂上漲，再創新高價。白粳黑市越二十萬元，白元已達二十三萬元。因產區價格亂漲，來源枯竭，昨日市塲共祗到貨一三一五石，各幫貨樣幾均斷絕，市塲交易無形停頓。而各米號除少量配給米供門售外，米櫃中多空空如也。社會局昨仍於市塲拋出白米及暹邏米共九千包。吳市長今晨自京返抵滬，當可携歸全國物價會議對本市糧食問題之對策。</p>
<p>社會局吳局長日昨向記者分析來價上漲之原因，認爲並非人爲因素。蓋政府對此管制甚嚴，且轉瞬雨季將臨，決無人敢大量購囤。</p>
<p>昨日洋粉高至十三萬元，較前日狂跳一萬三千元。本粉八萬九千元，漲七千五百元。大連靑豆十六萬三千，較前日高二萬三千元。浦東杜豆十八萬五千元，高二萬元。麩皮六萬九千元，漲六千元。江北苞米八萬九千元，漲九千元。崇明沙赤豆十九萬五千元，高五千元，長字豆餅五萬六千元，漲起四千五百元。營口豆餅八萬八千元，高五千元。</p>
<h3>食糖漲風略平</h3>
<p>昨糖市漲勢略平，但猶升萬餘元至數千元。如秘魯細砂爲四十二萬八千元至四千元，升萬元至六千元。粗白及中砂亦升萬元之譜，靑糖較平，汕靑無軒輕，高順德靑二十六萬元，次之二十五萬五千元，刁靑廿四萬二千元至二十五萬元，高興化白四十二萬元至四十萬元，高興化赤三士萬〇五千元至三十萬元，特高汕頭白四十四萬元。</p>
<h3>茶葉加做押款　已達一六〇億</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行自辦理茶商加做押款以來瞬屆一月，頃悉截至目前爲止，該行已貸出一百六十餘億，去年茶貸之茶葉，僅有一小部未辦理加押手續，預計下週可吿結束，全部加押貸款爲二百億左右。</p>
<h3>龍井明跌暗平</h3>
<p>杭州新龍井到源依然不絕，惟均係三四批之貨色，品質遠不如前之鮮嫰，故同業互做價再度削小，但趨勢以人心不衰，繼續明跌暗平。其他花色仍僅三十五年度白琳紅茶，營口帮猶來問津，餘均去化不力，情况則均不變。洋莊茶市買戶胃納仍狹，態度倔硬，非巧不取，是以雙方談判難獲順利，成交數量並不精采，行情虛浮如故。</p>
<h3>銀聯理事長　李馥蓀就職</h3>
<p>全國銀行公會聯合會在京閉幕後，於昨日（三十）假上海銀行公會召開臨時理監事會議，出席理監事三十餘人，由杜月笙氏任臨時主席，當塲一致歡迎理事長李馥蓀就職，李氏即席發表就職演詞，嗣即由李氏生席，繼續討論會務之進展，至五時許散會。</p>
<h3>棉布市仍堅挺</h3>
<p>棉布市况，初開盛傳棉紗將提高限價，因之市氣飛揚，四君子金印元嗶嘰吸收者甚衆，價做高至二十四萬二千元，執貨者尙圖扳持·二十支無牌細布因前日紡建公司配額有限，故價自二十一萬九千元步高至二十四萬二千元，龍頭細布亦昂至二十七萬元，其他白坯及色布士林等，均見堅穩。</p>
<h3>市塲人心堅俏　華股繼續邁進</h3>
<p>華股昨人心仍堅，絲價飛躍，次熱及雜牌各股繼續邁進，以致永紗在較形便宜之下，亦被帶上。銀根問題，當爲此後之關鍵。</p>
<p>晨初開出各股均升，僅遞永紗未見振作。開後二三一號一五三號七八號九七號九八號一二五號供售，自四九〇〇元低落至四八〇〇元。美亞等次報低後步漲，形勢甚穩，一五三號七六號一一二號一人六號一一七號二二六號二二三號一〇六號四號一三號八九號一四二號一二九號二二四號乘機購買，漸漸回升至五〇〇〇元·一一七號一六〇號九一號尙有了結，微起拉鋸現象，及中絲五和漲達限度，一〇六號一一七號四號九四號八九號九五號二二四號更進至五〇八〇元。一四號九五號復進至五一〇〇元。新亞亦吿漲停，一六三號九一號一〇七號一三七號在高價時了結，回降至四九八〇元。一二六號一〇六號九五號二三一號八九號九四號等俱進，午刻遞永紗遂抬高至五一五〇元左右而後略平。收後喊價拉高至五一八〇元，結果較前收計永紗美亞新華華豐各漲半成强。中法平，新光景福微升，永公升一成弱，勤興漲成半，信和無成交。遞交計信和景福微升，新光平平，永公華豐永紗美亞各漲半成左右。冷股中絲新亞漲停，國貨內衣平穩，統益微升，五和會漲停，餘股各漲半成强。</p>
<p>午後祗做即交，中絲新亞榮豐商務首告漲停，永紗由一四二號二三二號一七〇號二二三號均進，而漲到五二六〇元。九四號一〇七號一一七號脫手，退至五二一〇元。一六〇號二二三號二二四號一八五號九四號八五號奮納，景綸火柴新華五和永公水泥勤興九福大通次第漲達限度，乃將永紗抬高至五三一〇元。六三號三一號一〇四號七六號一八八號一四號有售，復低至五二〇〇元。二二三號一四五號一〇五號維持之下，復聞四行兩局差出之訊，三時後又升至五三〇〇元，此訊實慶誤傳，二一五號六〇號一七七號六二號陸續脫手，臨收迫低至五一九〇元低價而後轉盤。收後略昂。結果較前收計勤興新華永公漲停，中法升一成，信和美亞漲一成弱，永紗景福華豐升半成强，新光微升。遞交祗半天交易，新光平平，景福信和微升，永紗美亞永公華豐各漲半成左右，冷股計九福商務大通中絲火柴景綸五和水泥新亞均吿漲停，中紡榮豐統益漲停後有回，各漲一成內外，內衣升半成，永業高後急回，結果軋低。塲外各股計五洲平平，餘股各升少許迄半成不等，大生漲風最甚。</p>
<h3>港滙刺激　外股回漲</h3>
<p>外股昨低後步高，良以港申匯又吿報縮。怡紗晨開六〇〇〇〇元，自六〇三〇〇元起，由證券帮及散買了結而迫低至五九一〇〇元。廣帮來進而轉定，後受港匯刺激，午後迫近六一〇〇〇元結束。洋行帮吃進會德豐甚多，頗爲生色。結果較前收計會德豐英聯開平紙業各漲半成强，餘均微漲。</p>
<h3>統債平靜</h3>
<p>公債昨平穩少變，統丙晨開一七〇〇〇元，高價一七九〇〇元，低價一六一〇〇元而後轉盤。散戶有納，五〇三室五五二室及泰豐均售，成交約六七百萬。結果較前收計甲乙戊各降四百元，丙丁榮辱俱微。</p>
<h3>討論雜糧輸出　財部召開會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部爲討論大豆·芝蔴·生仁·菜籽·及其榨油之定量輸出許可辦法，特於昨日上午十時，在中央銀行召集經濟部·及輸出推廣委員會代表會議，財部由張福運代表出席，主持會議。討論經過，擬呈請當局，指定專門機關，負責核辦許可事宜。同時須調査目前國內對上述各項原料及其榨油之產量若干，國內之需要量若干，可資輸出之數量若干，以便核定其準確之輸出量云。</p>
<p>又訊，據中央信託局接到紐約拍來世界油籽行市觀察報告，認爲最近國際市塲上油籽之供應，已感有餘。而美國方面之大豆，亦有相當產量。再以近月來，國際油脂行市，其騰漲率業已超出一般物價騰漲率之上，故預測國際市塲之油脂期貨行市，趨勢將吿疲輭云。</p>
<h3>遵照物價委員會決議　紡建昨調整紗價</h3>
<p>四月份議價亦經該會決定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日起，開始按照全國物價委員會所決談之棉紗新議價售紗。以廿支標準紗爲準，售價每件爲四百六十萬元。其他各支棉紗售價，詳見本報下列商情欄。該公司昨日除自售三十二支雙股，及四十二支雙股棉紗若干件外，復循例代紡管會售紗，共售各支紗一六九七件，內廠商一三四三件，紗號三五四件。廠商申請單共五五四張，紗號申請三五四戶。</p>
<p>記渚昨訪中國紡建公司副總經理吳味經，渠甫參加全國物價委會返滬，承語記者，此次全國物價委會，以上海方面議價，因循不決，殊非得策，故即按聯總供給棉花及限額進口棉花之成本，加工繳及合法利潤等，決定四月份議價，以廿支標準紗爲準，每件四百六十萬元。此較三月份之議價三百七十萬元，約提高百分之廿七。其他各支紗價，依棉花價格，再比例核定之。收購價亦相同。對於當前之紗布問題，渠曾列舉數點，向全國物價委會報吿：（一）棉花問題：棉花短絀，實爲促成此次紗布上漲主因之一。按過去情形，各廠存棉，平均在四五個月以上，茲者已感極度短絀。限額進口之棉花，不能如期到滬。而新國棉須至十月杪，方能登塲。最早亦需至十二月底一月初，方能供用，緩不濟急。故各廠均感棉花發生恐慌，遂不惜向市搜購棉花，致棉花行市，愈抬愈高。故解決紗布問題之首着，應使棉花按期充份供應各廠應用。（二）目前電力供應情形，雖吿好轉，惟紗布產量，並無顯著之增加，紡建公司亦不例外。蓋對內，以公司同人待遇較差，生產效率亦受影響。對外則以紡建公司每日按牌配售紗布，日需賠蝕四五十億元，似應提請物價委會考慮消除該項矛盾現象。（三）對一般紗布情形之見解，渠認爲現因物價騰漲過速，紗布之再生產成本，實値得考慮，故評價時不妨稍寬，惟管制時務期嚴格云。</p>
<p>據悉：此次各地紗布市價一再騰漲，全國物價委會若干委員，以政府目前旣以外匯供給購棉，又設法調劑收購國棉資金，政府無形已把握紗布原料之供應，故對紗布之市價，應予合理之管制。一般預料，政府即將有更進一步有效之管制辦法頒行。聞此次滬市民營紗廠方面所建議之棉紗統籌產銷辦法，物價委會義為尙不無相當見地，已留案參考云。</p>
<p>木材稍回</p>
<p>杉木市價見高，賣方乘高拋售，市價梢回，洋松尙平穩。</p>

<h3>勞工運動的新途徑</h3>
<p>— 馬超俊</p>
<p>勞工運動，是十九世紀以來，瀰漫全世界的狂潮，在此種偉大運動過程中，因各國經濟發展之情形不同，而有工業發達國家與經濟落後國家勞工運動本質的分別，西歐工業發達國家的勞工階級，初時，無論在政治方面或經濟方面都是弱者，在政治方面是被統治者，代表勞工的政黨在政治上所佔的地位是十分微弱的；在經濟方面是被剝削者，經濟（工衆）進步的成果，幾乎完全歸資產階級享受，勞工階級的生活是非常困苦的，在這種情形之下，勞工運動的目的，在短時間是要求增加工資和减少工作時間，改善日常生活，而在長時間則是實行社會革命。</p>
<p>勞工運動的手段</p>
<p>勞工運動的手段一方面是組織勞工團體，實行集體議價，並在必要時用怠工，罷工，暴力或其他類似的方式貫澈他們的要求。一方面是組織勞工的政黨，甩流血的或不流血的方式來實施各種改革。後來勞工的團體日臻於健全，勞工的力量隨時隨地可以表現出來，如果工黨執政，則藉政治的權力，制定各種有關於勞工的法規或方案，以提高勞工的政治地位，增加勞工的福利和改善勞工的工作環境與日常生活，至於經濟落後的國家，勞工運動的情况便完全不同了，經濟落後的國家至今還是滯留在農業社會的階段裏，經濟階級的劃分並不明顯，因此，近代資本主義社會由於「工業」發達而生的一切不合理的許多勞工問題，還不存在於這些國家中，它們的工人所負的使命和任務也就跟西歐各國的工人不同。而勞工運動的性質亦就互異。</p>
<p>經濟落後的國家</p>
<p>經濟落後的國家勞工運動應採取基麼途徑？這首先我們應該注意的是經濟落後的國家有幾個特質，第一，在這些國家中，勞工階級所受到的剝削與壓迫遠較其他國家爲嚴重，勞工運動更有迫切的需要，第二，在這些國家中，工業不發達，勞工數目不多，組織亦不容易，無力與資本家相抗爭，因此勞工運動不易推動。第三，這些國家因生產落後，生活水準遠較經濟發達國家爲低，它們必須集中全力迅速增加及改進生產，然後才能改善生活狀况。第四，這些國家，爲着集中全力去從事生產或去從事工業化，它們必須有政治與經濟的安定。第五，依社會經濟的發展，這些國家必須實行工業化，實行工業化後，勞工的數目必多，而資本主義社會裏的許多勞工問題，可能隨之而生。從這五點看來，我們知道經濟落後的國家，勞工運動是有急切發展的必要，但這些國家的勞工運動又不能像資本主義社會的勞工運動採取怠工，罷工，或暴力等方式來擾亂社會秩序，减低生產，反使勞工運動失却意義，我們認爲唯一合理解決的辦法，應以一方面解除勞工所受的經濟壓迫，協助加強勞工的組織，扶植勞工的政治地位，保障勞工應有的權利，一方面勸使勞工與其他階層合作，努生增加生產，完成工業化的艱鉅工作，保證工業化的成果，合理的分配給勞工大衆所享受，如果採行道個途徑，則勞工經濟生活可以改善，政治地位可以提高，許多勞工問題自可隨之解決，怠工，罷工等行動是不必要之舉動。</p>
<p>中國工運的特質</p>
<p>中國是一個經濟落後的國家，它同樣具有一般經濟落後的國家的幾個特質，因此，中國勞工運動的性質，大體上與其他經濟落後的國家相同，故本黨的勞工政策本蕭勞資合作的精神，針對國家的需要，一方面保陣勞工的經濟利益和政治地位，使中國的勞力運動不必用怠工，罷工等行動來要求增加工資和减少工作時間，使中國的勞工運動不必用流血或不流血的手段來爭取其政治地位，一方面謀勞工工作效率之提高，以增加生產，促進民族工業之繁榮，完成建國之任務。因此，我國的勞工運動應切實根據本黨的勞工政策，遵循下列的途徑努力推進。</p>
<p>勞工組織與民主</p>
<p>（一）健全勞工本身組織並養成民主的風氣：勞工組織團體的目的，在以集體的力量，謀取經濟方面和政治方面的合法權益，今後我國的政治，將趨於民主化，我國的經濟將趨於工業化，而勞工須有健全組織的重要愈爲迫切，所以我希望勞工同胞認識本身組織的重要，迅速參加法定勞工團體的工會，至所謂培養民主風氣，就是指勞工的組織，行動及活動等應服從多數人的意志，尊重多數人的利益，使勞工運動的發展走上正軌的途徑，並使我國民主政治的基礎得以確立。</p>
<p>促進勞資協調</p>
<p>（二）促進勞資協調：在我國因產業不發達，階級觀念並不明顯，所以當前勞資問題不是勞資對立問題，而是勞資合作問題，各地間有發生的勞資糾紛，其於物價的因素多而於階級的矛盾的因素少，所以我國的勞資應携手共同致力於建國大業，才能增進彼此間之福利。</p>
<p>增加民族意識</p>
<p>（三）增强民族國家意識：增强民族國家意識，就是要减低階級意識和調人意識爲原則，我們應該團結合作，避免鬥爭，使人力和資本不致浪費，而集中全力把民族工業發展起來，三民主義早日實現，國家乃能富强，勞工同胞的生活水準方能提高。</p>
<p>提高工作率</p>
<p>（四）提高工作效率，努力增加生產，使國民收入能够增加，收入增加，才能使工業化早日達到，勞工生活水準提高，各種社會制度順利施行，勞工政治地位提高，抗戰期中，我勞工同胞均能努力增加生產，充實抗戰力量，獲得勝利，現在更須努力增加生產，完成建國的艱鉅工作。</p>
<p>遵守工勞動紀律</p>
<p>（五）遵守勞働紀律：勞働紀律的建樹和工人本身福利，工業發展互爲因果，如勞働無紀律，動輒罷工，使工業生產無法穩定，結果工業衰弱，工廠關門，工人失業。</p>
<p>工資穩定合理</p>
<p>（六）力求工資穩定之合理化：勞工的工資固須得到能够維持量低生活水準的數額，但若工資過高（超過國民經濟所能負担的水準）早晚會使工業無法維持，結果反增加工人失業數目，減少國民生產，加重通貨膨脹，生產不增加，通貨不安定，則工人實際生活不能眞正改善。所以工資要力求其合理化與穩定。</p>
<p>節制私人資本</p>
<p>（七）節制私人資本及發展國家資本：使生產工具不致落後於少數的資本家手裏，資本家的力量不致過分的膨脹，支配工人生活，使工人生活水準的抬高，可以和工業化進展的程度成正比例。　自從總理領導本黨革命，總裁繼承遺志以來，即對勞工運動極爲注意，且能遵循以上諸點去做，所以本黨歷次全國代表大會及中全會關於如何解決勞工經濟情况及扶植其政治地位，均有詳細的規劃。先後制定勞工法，勞工政策鋼要及工人運動實施綱要，以保障及改善工人生活，救濟失業，積極指導工人組織工會，並扶助其發展，增强勞工本身力量，爭取勞工應享的一切權益。在本黨一黨執政時期，政府對於勞工同胞也依本黨旣定的政策，在經濟方面，積極發展工業，使勞工同胞能够充份就業及改善經濟生活，在政治方面輔導其參政，在法律上規定我勞工組織的工會爲法人，國民大會職業界代表名額五十六名中，規定我農工同胞的代表名額佔百分之六十，從此可知我勞工同胞在憲法上的政治地位已增高，我勞工同胞有參政的機會。目前政府基礎已經擴大，行憲期近，本黨仍本旣定勞工政策爲我勞工同胞而奮鬥，惟希望我勞工同胞，本着自立自動自發的精神，依據本黨的勞工政策，向前邁進去爭取和維　勞工同胞的權益。</p>
<p>本人從事勞工運動三十餘年，對於勞工同胞所感受的痛苦知之最深，所企求解隊勞工同胞的痛苦之心亦最切，此次主持中央晨工部，自當藉此機會與我勞工潤胞共同努力來發展我國的勞工運動，以謀勞工同胞的眞正利益。</p>
<h3>工人自己的節日　談今後中國工運的方向</h3>
<p>— 陸京士</p>
<p>「五一」勞動節又來臨了，這是工人自己的節日，我們一年一度地逢到這個節日，眞是說不出的興奮和感慨，今年的勞動節更値得我們熟烈紀念，因爲我們勞工們在這次反侵略戰爭中，盡了最大的力量，爲的是摧毁野蠻和黑暗的暴力，爭取自由，進步和民主。我們終於獲到了勝利，這次戰爭有一個最大的收獲，就是經濟民主觀念的確立，我們在這裏用「觀念」二字，因爲事實上還止於「觀念的階段，沒有形成一個健全的制度。不過趨勢是很明顯的，人們已經感到僅僅每個人有一張選舉票是不够的，必須每個人都有飯吃，換言之，政治民主之外，必須要有經濟民主。</p>
<p>在美國政治上的民主是發揮盡致的。但經濟上貧富的對立則極其明顯。美國政府及社會各界有見及此，已在設法揚棄舊的資本主義，而從事於新的資本主義的建立，他們認爲舊資本主義是壟斷的，是防止他人競爭的，因此摧殘了力量較小者的機會。新資本主義要獎勵競爭和比賽，不但對於物質，就是意志領袖，地位和思想，都要予以機會來競爭，使他達到合理的標準，同時更能改善人生。</p>
<p>在英國社會化的生產計劃也在大規模地進行。許多交通事業，和重工業，政府都在實行國營和國有計劃。同時政府爲維持充分就業及保障人民的基本生活權利比維里治（Beveridge）的社會安全計劃已奉爲施政的圭杲。政府並想努力做到，凡有工作意志的人，不論其能否工作，都應有最低的收入，使他享受適當的衣，食·住·行·敎育，衛生，和生息傳養的生活。</p>
<p>在法國荷蘭，比利時，在歐洲許多國家，戰後的社會經濟制度，都有一個顯著趨勢，就是逐漸地朝著社會化的方向走。各個政黨之取得政權，是用自由民主的方法，同時運用合法的政權，實行社會主義的改量計劃。　這一切，和我們的民生主義在理想和實踐上，都是大致相同的民生主義是用「平均地權節制資本」的方法，達到不流血的經濟改革。換言之，我們是要訴諸理性，而不是訴諸暴力。民生主義和共產主義不同的是：前者主張階級協調，後者主張階級鬥爭，前者實行建設性的改革，後者則純然實行破壞，施行暴力。然而這正與我們國家人民的需要背道而馳，與我們立國的精神和建國的路向背道而馳。</p>
<p>最露骨的破壞力</p>
<p>全世界戰後區齊發展的趨勢是很明顯的，但各國政府，和人民的努力，並沒有完全克服經濟恐慌，不景氣仍然籠單着世界每一角落，這是爲了什麼？第一，這次戰爭的破壞太大了，短期內元氣不易恢復，第二，各國政治及社會的不安定影響到經濟復員工作之進行。這種現象，尤以中國爲量深刻。</p>
<p>中國復員工作受阻及經濟基礎之遭受破壞，爲衆所週知之事實。而中國共黨實爲最大而最露骨的破壞力。日本投降以後，中共繼續蹈着日寇的覆轍，淫，擄，刦，殺，無所不用其極。同時破壞交通摧毁工業設備，破壞礦塲，驅使廣大人民走向戰爭和死亡。中共以爲這樣不但可以把政府拖垮，而且製造貧病和飢荒，可以增加他們「革命」的力量。</p>
<p>共產黨的如意算盤雖是如此，但他們沒有想到，革命的基礎不能建立在沙灘上，光是破壞，也不見得就是革命。說中共在中國的作法是土匪式的，決沒有厚誣他們。我們只看到歷史上眞正革命的成功，我們沒有看到土匪可以打天下同時可鞏固天下。</p>
<p>中國於八年艱苦抗戰之餘，實在再經不起任何破壞了。世界已進化到原子時代，而我們不管國防工業也好，一般國民經濟也好，竟落後到十萬八千里，我們怎能生存於弱肉強食的世界？我們實應效法十月革命後的蘇聯，及第二次大戰後的法國，以共赴國難的精神，埋頭苦幹，如此縱不能迎頭趕上，也不致於太落在後面了。</p>
<p>勞工政策的措施</p>
<p>從抗戰勝利以來，這已經是第二屆勞動節了。在這一年零九個月當中，政府勞工政策的措施及勞工運動發展的路綫，大體是正確的。</p>
<p>首先，政府以生活指數計算工資的政策，是一種賢明的進步的措施。這個辦法，不但科正了中國歷年來「勞心者治人勞力者治於人」錯誤觀念，而且改去了許多無謂的勞資糾紛。其次，政府處理勞資糾紛的政策，也是正確的，如美國實行的一樣，政府量用調解及評斷方式，來解決勞資爭端，這是符合民主原則的。在調解及評斷過程中，勞資雙方都有代表參加。這還可以促進勞資合作增進勞資間的瞭解。</p>
<p>再次政府對於工會組織的扶持，也盡了最大的努力，目前全國產業及職業工會已有七千餘單位之多，且大多數都很健全，對工人福利亦狠重視。在將來行憲的時候，工會對於工人的關係是十分重要的。</p>
<p>復次今年一月一日公佈之憲法對保障勞工及社會安全也有具體的規定。根據憲法，國家不但要保障人民的工作權，同時要實施社會保險，實施婦女及兒童福利，推行保健事業，及公醫制度，以保障人民的生活。這都是合乎時代潮流的進步措施。</p>
<p>中國勞工運動的任務是艱鉅的：第一，他要謀民族的自由解放及勞工自身的自由解放，第二他要爭取人類的正義及世界的和平。這是需要長期及堅靱的奮鬥的，要達成這個任務，今後中國勞工運動的方向如下：</p>
<p>新方向（一）工人必須參政。各個工會應　量發動優秀工人參加國民代表及立法委員之競選，俾工人代表能參加立法機關，監督政府並爭取工人地位，與合理生活，促進民主政治之度施。</p>
<p>（二）加緊勞工敎育。中國民主政治之最大障礙及敎育太不普及，尤以勞工階級爲甚。今後工人要瞭解並過問政治，必須加强勞工敎育，以電影戲劇音樂美術等工具，及訓練班補習班等方式，進行自我敎育。各工會應以此爲中心工作。</p>
<p>（三）推行工作競賽運動，提倡勞資合作，改進機器設備，提高工作效率發展生產，增加社會財富。中國經濟落後，產業不振，勞工界必須認淸國家需要，把握重點，奮力邁進，社會並應養成重視勞働的風氣，使人人都能手腦並用，發奮圖强，增加生產，</p>
<p>（四）促進全國總工會組織。勞工界至今還沒有全國性的組織，殊爲遺憾，茲爲促進勞工團結並協助實行憲政，全國總工會的組織，實刻不容緩。希望今年「五一」以後即進行籌組全國總工會，並希望將來成立以後，不但對本國工人，即對國際勞工團體之聯繫及團結能發揮偉大的力量。</p>
<h3>勞動建國</h3>
<p>— 王邪倫</p>
<p>五月一日，全世界的勞工，不分國家，不分種族，不分男女，不分老幼，都將以愉快興奮的心情來迎接這一年一度的屬於他們自己的光榮美麗的紀念日。</p>
<p>有了勞動，人類才能從大自然的奴隸走向大自然的主人，從原始走向文明，從穴居野處，茹冒飮血走向原子冊時代，勞動是創造之母，我們中國工人，以一滴滴的汗備出了五千多年燦爛的文化，我們以自己的勞動，戰勝了凶禽猛獸，戰勝了風雷水火，戰勝了奴隸主，戰勝了封建領主，戰勝了暴虐的君王，戰勝了兇殘的軍閥，戰勝了在暴的帝國主義，戰勝了無數的歷史的罪人。</p>
<p>一分勞力，一分收穫，有一分熱，發一分光，自由幸福並不是一蹴可成的東西。不管國內好亂成性的嗜血敗類純粹爲了一己和一黨的利益在如何地破壞交通，阻撓建設，摧殘國家生機，新喪民族命脈；不管國際新帝國主義，軍火商人，戰爭販子，金融媒頭純粹爲了少數集團的旣得的和貪圖的利益，在如何在妄地呌囂，鬧得滿天殺氣和極力發動，佈署新的世界戰爭；我們懂得如何認淸國家的和自身的確切需要，我們懂得如何在苦難中磨鍊自己，我們懂得如何堅定自己的意志，我們懂得中華民國的創造者和領導者所昭示我們的應該走的究竟是怎樣方向的一條道路。</p>
<p>我們很榮辛，在中華民國的土壤上，尤其在最近短短的半世紀中，產生了多少光輝卓異的革命運動和工人遝動的領袖，他們領導我們對滿淸政府鬭爭，領導我們向北洋軍閥鬭爭，領導我們對日本帝國主義者鬭爭，而且都獲得了優越的成就。在今天，憲法業經制定，聯合政府已吿成立，儘管在通往民主自由富强康樂的新中國大道上不無荆棘障礙，我們究竟在這風雨如晦的日子裏跨出了新生的第一步。走總比不走好些，幹總比不幹强些。</p>
<p>不過，話說回來，建國的實際工作不比侈言容易，工業是現代國家的骨幹，工人就是現代國家的實應支持者！我們不要小看了勞工，更不能妄自菲薄，在平時，衣食住行，那一樣少得了工人？在戰時，攻防進退，又那一樣少得了工人？在道千瘡百孔飽經憂患的中國土地上，要建立一個民有民治民享的近代化國家，工作迫切地需要着我們。在當前紛亂破碎，百廢待舉的局勢中，我們工人，應當以航戰情神建國，讓我們再以自己的勞動事業爲新中國的建設放一異彩。（三十六年勞動節前夕上海）</p>
<h3>五一節論工運新課題　以事為主·以人為輔</h3>
<p>— 陸克明</p>
<p>今年紀念五一節，適値本黨（國民黨，結束訓政，實施還政於民之時，因此時代賦予勞工運動者的新課題是：「怎樣引導勞工大衆正確地運用自己的權能。」這決不是空洞的理論或消極的管敎，所可收效，我們應該激發勞工大衆認識自己的重要，寳貴自己的利益，換句話說就是要勞工大衆自尊自重，以往「幹部決定一切」的策略，到今天已不能適用了！運用幹部領導基層，在訓政時期是利多於弊，到了行憲以後將是弊多於利了！因爲從上而下的領導方式，常使高級幹部僅接觸一部份中級幹部由中級幹部與下級幹部保持聯絡關係，而廣大的勞工羣衆在層次中間隔了核心機構，對總的運動政策和領導人物，充其量形成了偶像式的肓目祟拜，或間接的認識而已，如果幹部不健全，使勞工大衆對整個政策的信心發生動搖，甚至懷疑，這種以人爲爲主的制度，實在非常危險，所以今天我們從事工運應該以事爲主以人爲輔，不因人而設事，而要爲事而用人，簡言之，領導不在少數幹部決定，要以福利事業的基礎去鞏固組織，尤其要緊的在啓發勞工自動的參加與設計，負責領導勞工的幹部再不能執拗着高高在上指揮如意的作風，必須換之以服務勞工的精神，一方面服務，一方面領導，雙方並進，使勞工大衆感覺到不是在被領導，而體味到服務熱情的偉大。在服務的機會中循循善誘到自發自勵之康莊大道。這是刻不容緩的革新，願與工運先進一共勉之。</p>

<h3>大學院系選習指導</h3>
<p>— 吳達泉</p>
<p>杜佐周等著　中國文化服務社出版</p>
<p>當靑年學生進了大學以後，究竟應該選習那一種課程？關於道個問題，我想火家都能感到他的嚴重性。許多跨出了學校大門而晋入社會的靑年，由於就業的困難，常有「學非所用」的感覺。同然最終的原因是在現在我國的社會建設的各部門，都還不能均勻發展，同時，人事制度也不能上軌道的緣故。但當初在學校時的選習課程，實在是一個最大的起因。</p>
<p>「大學院糸選習指導」他帮助了學生們解決這個難題，當然不能說他已包含了大學所有的課程，但全書二十三篇文字裏，已包括了十三種不同的院系課程，差不多每一篇文字就等於一科的入門，這對於一個沒有受過正確指導升學方法的學生，不啻是一個優良的師伴，他很淸楚地分析和介紹着每個院系的內幕和入學的準備，然後讓你自己估量你的能力，興趣，志願，以及將來出路等條件下，選習一科。</p>
<p>糾正學生對於任何院系的觀念，在這本書裏，也有極深切的指示。比如讀政治，因爲政治不是實用科學，而且學政治的出路是做官。以做官爲目的，似乎可鄙，以致引起一部份靑年的不願去學他，可是作者明確的指出「……假使我們現在最覺悟最革命的靑年都視政治爲畏途，不願意學政治和從政，面議一班沒有覺悟的腐化份子去担任政治工作，試問我國政治如何能够希望有進步？……」（見一〇八頁）又如學敎育，也許有人以爲敎育是一件淸苦的工作，爲個人利益計，學敎育實非相宜，但作者却說：「……；敎育這行道，固然是苦，但苦中有樂，要想體味其中業處，却非深入其境，終身寢饋於此的難以辦到」。（見七二頁）從這二段文字裏，吿訴我們必須正視每一種課程的價値，只要學業上有成就，所謂「行行出狀元」，都有他的出路，問題在於你是否能够努力在學術上下工夫而已。</p>
<p>選定了課程後的如何努力去研修，也是每個學生應該注意的，有許多往往進了一科，讀了些時，覺得困難或無趣，便改讀他科，這樣的改弦易轍，不但不能達到你的目的，結果往往一事無成。誠如作者說「對於一種學習，若能持之以恒，興趣便逐漸加强，所謂「功到練成金，樂趣自然生」。這樣的鼓勵和開導，在指導我們選習院系課程之外，對於學業的進展，也會有更大的帮助。</p>
<p>「盲目求學，不感興趣，對於國家，對於個人，都是不利」，靑年的能否就各個發展而有成就，實關聯着國家未來的命運，「大學院系選習指導」替我們指出了一條明顯的途徑，「如果這問題能得適當解決，不但個人才能可以順應發展，安心求學業之深造；即一生事業的成就，生活的幸福，也都在這裏立下始　。同時社會國家亦因個人健全的發展，滿足其需要，繁榮其建設，而蒙受其實益」了。</p>
<h3>毛姆論其近作</h3>
<p>— 蔡雪譯</p>
<p>從事寫作有五十年之久，現在已經七十二歲的英國作家毛姆（S.Maugham）看上去還是那麽健康，敏捷，和令人起敬。他想說什麼就說出來，而所講的也不一定是人家所願意聽的。不像別的名人，他並不覺得自已有何神秘；他沒有「派頭」。他的聲音台訴人他是聰明和氣的；他的眼光又讓我們知道他對自己和別人還有些幻想。在一間擁擠的屋子中，你也許沒有見他，而他却早已注意到你了。</p>
<p>在上次大戰中，他在情報處工作，寫了那本關係一個間諜的小說，“Hshenden”。這次他在美國致力於改善英美關係上。他也寫了本小說呌「剃刀邊緣」，銷了三百萬本。美國人很敬重這樣一位「大使」。有人問他此書銷路如此之廣是否爲了其中的宗敎動機。「是的」，他說，「從我收到的信中，我很確定這一點；美國人現在不滿意他們的人生哲學。權力，金錢，和成功沒有帶來他們所希望的結果」。</p>
<p>他又：「我打算再寫兩本書；一本最後的短篇小說集，一本關於斐利浦第三時的西班牙的小說—並非歷史性的—此後我將「退休」，兩把我自十八歲起就開始的筆記加以選擇後付印」。</p>
<p>毛姆自上次戰後即去東方，那裏他找到了最完善的題材。除了人類的束縛一書，是在這些東方小說中，毛姆顯出了他所以成爲作家的本質。</p>
<p>當提起靑年作家怎樣過活時，毛姆說：「只有兩種作家能靠他們的書生活—小說家和短篇小說家，沒有一個詩人能這樣做過」。</p>
<p>他捐了一筆錢給作家協會設立幾個遊歷獎金。拿到這獎金的人（四百英鎊）該設法能留在外面多久就多久，並無其他條件。</p>
<p>對於西方，毛姆作何看法呢？他說：「我對於將來是樂觀的；我不信還有一次戰爭。我想俄國現在是筋疲力盡了，也有些恐懼。我們一定要想法减輕他的恐懼心理。但是使我怕的倒是美國。現在美國有將軍們以爲必須乘俄國尙軟弱時把他打倒；也有商人想統治全世界。美國有些焦急不安和神經過敵。當人們在神經過敏時是容易闖禍的」。</p>
<p>毛姆不打算一直留在美國，雖然他頗喜歡美國人。他想念歐洲，預備在法國的Cap　Ferrat（那裏他有一所別墅）渡過他的餘年。（本文取材自Post）</p>
<h3>日本出版界近况</h3>
<p>— 俞守中</p>
<p>一九四六年一年，日本出版界的書籍，除了雜誌以外，初版的共二千七百〇二種，重版的一千一百二十五種。</p>
<p>以此計算，則日本在去年一年中，每天平均出版的書雜，在十種以上。但今年起，這個數字又增加了。目前日本，每天平均有二十種以上的書籍，包括初版重版，自印刷所運到書舖裏出售。</p>
<p>新書在內容方面，以文藝類爲多。而文藝畫籍中，又以偵探小說及通俗小說較多。其次「全集」也特別多。自軟性作家岡本力四子，久保田萬太郎，夏目漱石起，乃至硬性作家三木淸，大山郁夫，櫛田民藏等爲止的全集，都陸續間世。此外托爾斯泰，杜斯妥也夫斯基，紀德，瓦萊里等歐洲作家全集，也先後出版。</p>
<p>除了文藝性書籍外，兒童讀物也相當多，但大部份是重版，而且對現代兒童心理，是否適當，頗成問題。一部份兒童畫報，內容更形落伍。</p>
<p>社會科學方面，社會主義的書籍，在吉田內閣登台後，已逐漸滅少。代之而起的是比較穩健的書籍。不過像高橋正雄的「社會主義的話」，伊部政一的「社會主義發展史」，氣賀健三的「現代社會主義思想論」等書，仍洗行市　。</p>
<p>有關民主問題的書籍，當然風行一時。不過內容並沒有什麼特出之處。充其量，也不過從以前的光注重「量」，而改到現在的較重「質」而已。此項書籍中，以大島正德的「民主主義基本概念」，新明正道的「民主主義概論」兩書，擁有校多之讀者。</p>
<p>時事方面的書籍，非常稀少。反蘇的東西，有逐漸抬頭之趨勢。有關檢討戰爭的書本，幾乎絕跡。</p>
<p>日本在投降以後，朝野人士常談到爲什麽會戰敗的問題。大多數歸罪於科學，技術，資源，人口之不如人。絕少談到這個戰爭的侵略本質和應負責任等問題的。出版界自難例外。最近由於國際局勢的演變，日本生產的逐漸恢復，過去的對戰爭反省等等，早已不談。要談的，已變成怎樣使日本通過下次大戰而變成强國，日本出版界今後的動向，似乎也不致離開這題目太遠吧。</p>
<h3>中國地理敎科圖</h3>
<p>— 盧材禾　孫盤壽</p>
<p>本岡係「中國史地圖表編纂社」金擎宇氏編纂，於去年十二月增訂再版。翻看這本岡，所得第一個印象就是繪製非常精細，令人獲有美感。內共有圖四十六幅，分省圖佔三十一幅，其他爲天文，世界各圖，地勢，政區，水系，氣候，土壤，人口密度，產業，交通，國防諸總圖，在這些圖頁前面，列有一幅以天然色渲染的全國立體地形圖，使讀者認識我國疆域逼眞的形貌、實爲本圖一大特色，而後面的地勢圖，在準確度和色調方面，堪稱完美，如與立體圖對照研覽，極有趣味。全國水系圖將全國重要河流已羅列無遺，其流域的劃分，亦極合理，惟圖例所列諸「河系流械」一詞，如改爲「斜面洗域」，意義可較明朗。</p>
<p>人口密度圖很淸晰，至於兩幅產業岡，各種符號，最好就其輕重而別以大小，例如成都平原產米，河西走廊也產米，但二者的產量相差極大，所以成都平原所印的「米」字不妨大一點，河西走廊印得小一點，這樣看圖的人便自然而然會知道某種產業何處重要，何處次要了。</p>
<p>交通圖內容很周詳，主要港埠相互間的距離，於圖的左下角分別說明，至有參考價値，不過公路綫和航空綫都用紅色表示，容易使看圖的人的感覺混亂，以用兩種顏色表示較好，航空綫似可畫得細一點，水道交通，可以通航的地段如果能用符號示明，讀者就可一目瞭然，省去許多翻閱書報的工夫。如果覺得一張圖上包含的材料太多，圖面太亂太雜，不妨把省界略去不畫，否則分繪兩圖，因爲交通是地岡中一個重要的部門。</p>
<p>重要城市圖，最好依照人口多少的分級，用大小的紅點表示，這樣可較顯明。上海是我國的經濟中心，南京是我國政治中心，本圖把它們併合獨成一幅，是很有意義的。天文圖和世界全圖，似可不必插入本圖册之內，因爲這和世界地岡的材料不免重複。</p>
<p>後面的分省圖，除東北九省和綏遠寗夏兩省因爲地域錯綜，合二省或三省爲一幅外，其餘都是一省一幅，雖然各幅的比例尺因此不能統一，影響讀者對於面積廣狹的感覺，但在國人於省區觀念甚爲濃原的今日，這種配置方法確是比較合乎現實的。各省地圖都很細緻，公路幹綫和支綫分別以粗細綫表出，輕重之別，讀者一覽便知。只是每幅地圖的地名列得太多，像四川廣東雲南河北山東諸省，圖上被密密的地名佔據着，看岡的人很費力爲本圖是敎科圖，所以大部名是提不到的，不重要的地名如果少寫，圖面比較單純，讀者的感覺便淸楚了，在編者方面想一定是恐怕大家找不到地名，所以不慎煩地捨簡求詳，這種好心我們可以推知。</p>
<p>本圖的說明，都極精要，從這中間是找不到什麼廢話的，總圖部分的說明，但最好將地形概觀，氣候特性，人口分佈，產業狀况，都市形成等，分籲詳說。</p>
<p>上面所提出的一點意見，不論是對是錯，我們的主要目的乃在引起編輯當局和有心人士的討論而已。</p>
<h3>「文學論初步」</h3>
<p>— 忽然</p>
<p>蔡儀著·文化生活出版社版</p>
<p>「文學初步」一書中，包括文學本質上的幾個問題，就是：（一）文學是什麽？（二）文學是爲什麽？（三）文學是怎樣發生和發展的？作者在這本小册予裏，把這三個問題，作了深切的分析和解釋，我們現在以他的中心思想，簡括分述如下，供給愛好文學的讀書們，作爲一種參考：</p>
<p>（一）文學是什麽？文學就是給我們一些事物的印象，激起我們的感情，並可增長我們的認識—這就是說：當我們在讀一本小說的時候，書中所描寫的人物，他們容貌態度，言談和動作，始終浮現在我們的腦筋裏，當他陷人某種不幸的遭遇時，你爲他憤怒，悲恨；當他在奮鬥掙扎之際；你就會爲他激動担心；並是小說中所描摹的一些背景，讓我們明淸地認識，我們所生活的圈子是怎樣的黑暗和複雜；找們在讀後的沉思裏，該有怎樣的警覺性。</p>
<p>文學是描寫客觀現實界的事物，社曾上的人物和事件，決不是叙述空洞的描象的理論；牠不僅吿訴我們自然事物的鳥獸草木，並且讓我們對事物有一種認識，因爲我們可以了解某件事物產生的社會性和歷史的動回；一本小說可能表現許多歷史書所不能詳盡表現的歷史知識，一首短詩可以表現一篇長論文所表現不了的大道理—以文學能增加我們的智識，使我們能得到對於該事物本身存在環境的統盤認識。</p>
<p>（二）文學是爲什麽？文學作品並不是專爲着要宣傳一種思想，或是發揮一種敎訓的工具；也不是一種供人消遣的娛樂品；嚴格地說來，牠是組織社會一種工具；一個人要和其他的人在一起生活，便要有方法傳達和接受思想情感，這樣人類才可以互相協助，互相聯擊來過社會生活；文學作品就是這種最好的傳遞工具；因爲牠能把事物表現得更具體和完全化，問時牠的讀者羣亦較　大，牠不僅反映出客觀的事物，同時把社會的發展也顯示出來了；所以一個眞正的文學工作者，他所表現的社會意識，一定是要前進的正確的，富於革命性的。</p>
<p>（三）文學是怎樣發生和發展的？文學是一種比較精緻的產物，人類進化到相當階段後的結晶品；牠的發生與發展是視社會基礎來決定的。文學的起源不僅僅是由於人類宗敎情緒的發達，而是由於勞動產生的；苦力們口中發出的「杭育」之聲，有人以爲是文學的起源；狩獵時代野蠻民族的歌唱，便是詩歌的雛形；所以我們就把詩歌列爲最早的文學；那時候的詩歌與音樂跳舞是分不開的；等到叙事詩和抒情詩分化後；二人以上可歌誦和表演的叙事詩，便是歌劇的濫觴；而一個人來歌誦的叙事詩，便是彈詞的開端；歌劇到了資本主義的前夜，發展爲話劇，而彈詞之類便發展到現代型的小說；這就是今日文學諸形或發生和發展的大致情形。</p>
<p>文學隨着社會史的發展；可分爲下面四個階級：</p>
<p>（一）奴隸社會的文學—這時代的文學內容除了和宗救有關之外，一部分是反映奴隸主的生活，很少是反映奴隸的生活的內容思想方面獨多頌揚神的慈惠；而且注重形式，所以「詩」在當時便成爲最好的形式了，那些不能以詩來表現的理論文，使用賦的形式，老子易經的文句就是有韻的—這就是當時文學的特點。（二）封建社會的文學—奴隸社會的末期，自由人民的個性，創造力得以發揮，於是自漢至隋，我國文學成績斐然可觀；（這時候，西歐方方面正個文學衰頺的時期），唐宋的詩詞，已發展到最燦爛的地步，可是那些作者多半是統治階級出身的所以他們對於被壓迫的農奴，祗止於同情而已；到了十五六世紀以後，小說劇本己漸發達起來，表現力比較强，很易得到讀者的歡迎，而且內容方面，常以暴露封建地主的無能及罪惡爲主，「紅樓夢」「水滸傳」「官塲現形記」等等，便是實便。（三）資本主義的社會文學——資本主義抬頭之後，人類掙院舊的束縛，期求個性的發展他們以平等自由爲中心思想，所以文學方面的成就比較高超，新文學運動的目的，正就是在反對一切封建的束縛。（四）新世紀的文學——人民的世紀，需要政治與經濟上自由，這時候，人民這種藝本的要求，已反映在文學上，成爲人民的文學；而在本質上與過去的亦略有不同；第一這是以人民爲主人翁的，第二這是以人民的觀點來把握客觀事物的；第三這是以人民的語言來表現的；高爾　和其他偉大作家的創作要，便具有運種因素；所以文學的前途，不僅與文學作家的努力有關，同時牠是配合人民力量的成長和社會的進步。</p>
<p>「文學論初步」是一本純理論的小書，作者以最簡易的方式，讓我們在極短的時間內，認識一下文學本質上的一些要點；我們現在用少量字句，把扼要的思想介紹出來，無非是希望讓讀者們，對幾個文學上蒸礎的問題多一種認識。</p>
<p>本書除了在闡明理論方面尙稱淸晰外，並無其他顯著的特色，同時作老在書後並未把參考書目列出來，這對於深究這問題的讀者們頗爲不便。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>勞動的社會——爲五一勞動節作</h3>
<p>— 戈夷</p>
<p>我們這一個社會，牠的一切文明與敎化就是人類勞動的產物。不論是思想的或是體力的勞動，我們的目的就是獲取人類更火的生活資源和尋求更多的快樂與幸福。過去原始時代的人類的勞動是向着這一標的前進，現在原子時代的人類勞動亦是如此，即將來亦不會有所轉移。</p>
<p>照理，在社會進化到二十世紀，以我們人類勞動所累積的成果，今日我們大家必定有足够的人生幸福，至少亦決不會有飢寒凍餒之處的。然而事實上我們知道今日大半數的人民却在生活煎熬下過着困苦的日子，而且不知多少的人民便因了衣食的無着而疾病而夭亡。</p>
<p>顯然的，人類的社會雖然進化了但人價不合理的社會制度也跟着產生了。我們不說別的；爲什麽有些人想盡他的腦力或體力去勞動，而結果竟無處可使？爲什麽勞働者的收入竟不能養活他自己和兒女？而不勞動的反是能享受舒適的生活，甚至及於他的兒子和戚族？這也是很顯然，這些人是略取那些勞働者的成果的。勞動者已整個的變成了資本家的私產——牛馬或是機器。</p>
<p>不過，我們的社會雖然不幸地經歷過所謂資本主義的時代，可是這一種制度終究爲人們覺悟到是人類進化的桎楷，是不幸的奴隸命運　時代的車輪軋過那一段艱辛的軌轍後，誰都不願回到那慘痛的道上去。現在，儘管我們的前途仍是坷坎，但民主的電炬已照到我們的眼前了。</p>
<p>凡是人都應該有合理的勢動，這勞動爲着自己同時也爲着社會；凡是勞動的人他都應該事有相當的生活資料，他所需用什麽，他就該有什麽，社會的工作是分工的，但分工並不就是劃成人類的等級；在創造更文明的生活意義上說，大家都是英雄。而且思想的勞動和體力的勞動是互相結合一體的。</p>
<p>大家有書讀，有工做，有一切的給養與需要。我們必然爲朝向這一個方向而努力，今日勞動節的意義就是在此吧。</p>
<h3>中國研究</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>大公報載測騐題中有日本會不會侵略中國問題一項，讀之頗覺慨然。</p>
<p>日本在投降前有專門研究中國的機構，如滿鐵調查局，來亞經濟調查局，東亞研究所等。此等組織，隨着日本投降固然解散消滅；但今日仍有許多新興的機構產生，對中國間題作各　綜合的調查研究，如去年一月成立的「中國研究所」，就網　熟息中國情形的學者專家達八十八人之多。</p>
<p>對中國研究出版的刊物，現有中國文學（生活社），新中國（實業之日本社），中國評諭（中國研究所編憐日本評論社發行），月刋中國（黃土社），新中華（帝國書院）等多種。反觀我們，對日本作專門研究的出版刊物有幾種？可說除報章刋載零星的文章以外，專門的絕無僅有。</p>
<p>他們研究中國的目的，毋庸說，是要把握現代中國的實相，研究中國中國際關係，批判日本過去對中國的政策，以樹立中日新的關係。（上語爲中國研究所事業綱要之一部份）他們覺得中國問題，直接簡接對他們有極大的影響。按之實際，日本的一舉一動，對我們的影響更大。</p>
<p>他們的作風，仍然要造成「日本工業國」，且在麥克阿瑟支持之下，漸漸向着這條道途前進，可是我們呢？依舊紛紛擾擾，「日本研究」更說不上。</p>
<h3>人妖非妖</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>在報上看到人妖的新聞，並且看到她的照片。此妖旣非三頭六臂，亦非靑面獠牙，更不見得妖形怪狀：始像一個上海人所謂的白相人嫂嫂，並沒有什麽妖氣。</p>
<p>再看她的行爲；第一是女扮男裝。女扮男裝未必是妖怪。一個女人究竟應該穿什麽衣服？你也說不出，我也說不出。漢人的古裝？西洋女人的打扮？還是外披火衣，上穿短　，下穿長褲，中間拖一件滿人的旗袍？</p>
<p>第二是男良家婦女。如果這個也算是唯有妖怪才做的事，那末我們這社會上的人妖實在太多了。引誘良家婦女的工具不一，其中最主要的幾件是金錢，勢力，地位，美貌，思想，口才等等。這個婦人所用的不過是一套男裝而已，並沒有什麽妖術在內。</p>
<p>第三是　上鈎的婦女施以猥　行爲。一說到這個，我們不禁想到社會上許多的紳士與太太，名洗與名媛，還是不說也罪。總之，這個婦人與這些人同樣都不足以種爲人妖。</p>
<p>第四是誘令吸烟上癮，與妖更無關係。第五是唆使與夫　異。這時代夫婦離異的多得很，並不聽說有妖精在裏面作怪。</p>
<p>第六是詐財。倘然這個老婦不爲了詐財而專幹前面的五件事，那末雖然不是一個妖，總得稱爲一個怪。現在正如西諺所謂一切道路都通到羅馬一樣，妙與你我他一般無二，可說殊送而同歸，忙忙碌碌，無非爲了一個利字。這又有什麽妖？又有什麽怪？實實在太凡俗了。太像所謂「大衆化」了。</p>
<p>人妖旣非妖怪，而關於人妖的故事，却有一點妖怪之氣。新聞的報道上說，人妖的俎上的肉，不乏姨太太之流，並且說出其中的一個便是某富商的姨太太。富商與姨太太自然同樣不是妖精，然而他們的關係總有一點怪氣。由此怪氣，才產生人妖的故事。</p>
<h3>「櫃台獅子」的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 麗泉</p>
<p>我從事了不滿一年的工運活動。認識了許多工運障碍，給我的印象，是棘手而苦悶，空虛和悲哀。這裏所說的是舊式商店的職工運動，更不涉於產業工人的範圍。</p>
<p>照理，在這民主時代，凡是人民合於正軌的言行，都不應該受着任何束縛。何况工運機構，是國家「用民」組織的一環，當然更應該獲得充分保障。然而因爲是民主伊始，一切有關工運的法令，還沒有脫胎換骨的緣故；所以目前從事工運，依然能隨時感到無限苦悶；職工們的心底，也仍是蘊藏着無限悲哀。</p>
<p>瞧吧，這是商店職工們普遍的現狀，十六小時的工作，從早晨六時起身，一直到晚上十時後睡覺；他們像一隻島關閉在籠子裏一樣，默默地終日在店裏做着店務，得不到任何娛樂的權利，尤其是學徒制下，不斷地在戕葬着活潑的孩子。低微的待遇，艱苦的生活，這樣服務到死，不知有多少怨恨，理葬在地下了，但從沒有獲得外界的同情。這被人們稱爲「概檯獅子」的一羣，是多麼可憐？他們還能從事工運活動嗎？還能享受工運權利嗎？</p>
<p>如果有人被選舉爲職工會的理事或是監事，那末他要能够知趣，少管工會事務還好；否則，他的飯碗就要發生問題。雖然，工會理監事被服務店中的資方解僱，必須呈奉當局認可，但在欲加之罪，何息無辭—發給他幾個月的解職薪金，還能有甚麽話說？</p>
<p>一個職工會的事務員，跑出去徵求會員，到處能够見到的；是那老　或是經理的一副繳靑面孔，斜白着眼睛，虎視着夥計們；這情形，雖在六月中的大熱天氣裏，也會使人感到寒慄。當然，他更能使夥計們噤若寒蟬，不敢加人工會了。所以大多數的職工們，都希望着工會能　强制他們入會。但是現行的「人民團體强制入會辦法」，誰會聽到有人用過它？這，不是工會事務員的偷懶，是「辦法」的不能適用於實際！（上）</p>
<h3>並非殺人</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>甲男：我要開槍打死那與我妻予結婚的人。</p>
<p>乙男：幹不得，這是犯殺人罪，不是嗎？</p>
<p>甲男：不是，這不過是自殺罷了。</p>
<h3>美國的汽車商店</h3>
<p>— 英冬</p>
<p>每星期日的早晨，美國鄉鎭的市街上，充塞着喇叭的響聲，白色的大卡車，在馬路上爬行，每隔五六十碼，便停一次，車上多半是孩子和女人，上面裝了雜貨，靑菜以及家用品，這種新設計的商店，多半由戰時汽車改成，由退伍軍人駕駛，他們把雜貨店擺在汽車上，象徵美國小型商業的活躍。</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>
<p>本報駐港記者林友蘭，自繙譯「阿丹諾之鐘」後，最近　　德國名作家雷馬克新著「凱旋門」，交「芭蕉社」出版。該書已運抵本市發售。芭蕉社爲南中國戰後唯一由渝昆大後方復員的文化人所組成之出版中心，現並有新著多種在程印中。</p>
<p>小說家艾蕪仍居重慶孤兒院，最近致函滬地友人云：「小孩四人，都在出痧疹，寫作停頓，將近一月。」（竟成）</p>
<p>SY（劉盛亞）近正從事蘇聯小說的　譯，有一部分是舊俄的小說，尙未經國人譯出，現劉氏正從德文本　譯。（竟成）</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「然而她已是胡太太了！」有人表示異議。</p>
<p>「結婚有什麽關係？」小張立即加以駁回。「你沒有瞧見她前幾天還帮着我們趕繪佈景嗎？」</p>
<p>「我覺得那個緋緋也可愛得很！」盧前也參加進他們的談話來。「昨天，她跟我們出去演放下你的鞭子，眞有許多人給她感動得哭的。可惜她們走的問題到現在也沒有解決。唉！這世界就根本不講理！」</p>
<p>實際上，蘭和緋緋的逃難問題倒是另有周折，並非單純的爲了沒有車了。待紹明最近又收到過胡覺文打重慶拍來的電報，請他務必設法把他太太和兒女帶元，並且答應照算車費旅費；而老徐那位太太則另有一種想法，因爲她是一個最好　榮，最愛擺架子的女人，以折辱別人和抬高自已作爲一種人生的樂趣。她很妒忌關的豐富的學識，——當然決不識服她的美——並且痛恨她那樣淸高而不輕易向人低頭的掘强的性格，甚至她已多少看透一些蘭和祝兆年過去的友誼；於是她的內心上起了一種强烈的慾望，想利用他們現在非找徐胖子帮忙不可的環境，硬把這個有學問有志氣的敵人　服下去，讓自己更暢快地發洩一下頤指氣使的習性，將來又可以對着熟人，嘴一披，很不屑地說：</p>
<p>「胡太太？算什麼！她見了我一樣不敢說話！」</p>
<p>因此，她反又慫恿徐紹明把她們母女倆幣走。</p>
<p>然而愛好藝術的蘭還有着一副比那位你太太更聰明的頭腦，她早就看透了徐紹明夫婦倆的個性，無論如何，她不願意讓自己和她的愛女投進他們的圈套中去，爲他們支配，爲他們欺凌。她很痛快地謝絕了他們的邀請，情　另行設法。祝兆年也尊重她的意思，打小榮隨着金愛　走的那一天起，便撥自搬出了凍汀那所小學校的宿會，跟　前張昌他們一起住在藝術館裏，免得給那位利口的徐太太浩謠中傷。（五九）</p>

<h3>The Situation at Jin-Yu is Tragic; Fenglingdu and Maojindu Were Captured</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, Thirtieth of This Month] The large-scale battle in southern Shanxi and northern Henan is expanding and becoming more tragic. Nearly one million refugees from the war zone are fleeing to the Zhengzhou and Luoyang areas on the south bank of the Yellow River. At the same time, the communist forces on the north bank of the Yellow River are constantly threatening to cross south at various ferries. The Henan Provincial Assembly sent six representatives to Beijing yesterday to urge the central government to quickly allocate huge sums of money and dispatch large armies to provide relief and suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Thirtieth of This Month] On the Yellow River line at the intersection of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan, the flames of war are burning hotter. The communist forces crossing south from Linjin suddenly entered Yongji and Fenglingdu on the 28th, with fierce fighting. The sound of artillery fire could be heard in Tongguan yesterday morning. Heavy fighting is taking place in the southern suburbs of Yuxiang and the northern suburbs of Miaocheng.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, Thirtieth of This Month] According to a responsible official here, the large-scale battle in southern Shanxi is becoming increasingly fierce. Most of Zhongtiao Mountain has been controlled by the communist forces. The ferries on the opposite bank of Daqingguan and Tongguan in Shaanxi, such as Fenglingdu, and the ferries on the opposite bank of Lingbao, such as Monan Town, and the ferries on the opposite bank of Huixing Town, such as Maojindu, have all fallen into the hands of the communist forces.</p>

More than ten scouts were sent across the river in advance to probe. Yesterday, four of them were captured by local security agencies. One of them was a communist company commander who claimed to have been ordered to cross the river to gather military intelligence and contact Wei Fenglou's troops. The security authorities have now deployed tight defenses along the river west of Kaocheng.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces Flee Back to Western Hebei; Mining Equipment in Jingxing is Dismantled and Moved by Communist Forces</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Baoding, Thirtieth of This Month] Most of the communist forces in the Baoding-Shijiazhuang area have fled back to western Hebei. More than 1,000 troops of Ma Hui's forces fiercely attacked the Nationalist troops' strongholds in Xushui and Caohejian last night, with fierce fighting throughout the night. Armored vehicles from Baoding rushed to assist. On the morning of the 30th, the communist forces were defeated and retreated to both sides of the railway. The destroyed tracks have been repaired and traffic has resumed.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Thirtieth of This Month] A semi-official source stated that the outside world has overemphasized the issue of opening the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section. In fact, the current operational objective is to annihilate the main communist forces. Therefore, the deployments in Qu County, Tang County, Ding County, Lixian County, and even Wangdu are all intended to facilitate transfers to other areas for combat at any time.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Thirtieth of This Month] Most of the communist forces from the Shijiazhuang area have been mobilized to the areas around Baoding to contain the Nationalist troops' large-scale sweep in the central section of Baoding-Shijiazhuang. The main Nationalist troops, which fought in Ding, Li, Tang, and Wan counties, have shifted their positions and are engaged in fierce fighting with the communist forces northwest of Gaoyang and south of Mancheng.</p>

A large number of communist forces are also gathering on the east bank of the Daqing River east of Baoding, and the Nationalist troops are paying close attention. Furthermore, the Jingxing coal mine machinery is being dismantled and moved by the communist forces.</p>
<h3>US Ammunition Depot in Xinhe Transferred to Nationalist Troops</h3>
<p>Surplus Ammunition Like Scrap Metal</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Tianjin, Thirtieth of This Month] U.S. Commander Howard announced today the transfer of the U.S. ammunition depot in Xinhe to the Nationalist troops, stating that after the depot was attacked by the communist forces on April 5th, most of the shells and other ammunition were loaded onto warships for self-use. The remaining small amount of ammunition was also transferred to the Chinese troops on April 21st. The depot was then handed over to Sun Suzong's troops for takeover. This matter was carried out on the orders of the U.S. Navy Department. After the communist attack, most of the stored ammunition was unusable and could not be moved. The exact amount of ammunition transferred to the Nationalist troops was not specified, only that it could mostly be used as scrap metal and was dangerous to move, at most only suitable for target practice. The Chinese authorities were also aware of this situation. There were also some Japanese tanks, which had been disarmed and could only be used as scrap metal. He also explained that the U.S. military was withdrawing completely (the U.S. troops in Tanggu will withdraw within the month), so transferring this ammunition to the Nationalist troops was for convenience. Destroying it on the spot would take at least two months. However, this action by the U.S. military does not set a precedent, and ammunition stored elsewhere does not need to be handled in this way, but should be regarded as belonging to the respective units. Tanks and other heavy weapons will be transferred with the troops to new defense areas in the Pacific, but none will be transferred to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Sun Liren Goes to Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, Thirtieth of This Month] Sun Liren, Jia Youhui, departed Changchun for Shenyang at 8 a.m. on the first.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Thirtieth of This Month] The Youth Party held meetings all day on the 30th to discuss the selection of candidates to participate in the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Agriculture and Forestry, but no decision was made by night. According to Chen Qitian of the party, "Party members are trying to persuade Li Huang not to resign from his position as Minister of Economic Affairs, and no final decision has been made yet." Reporters then met with Li Huang again to ask about his date of assuming office. Li seemed very angry, but urgently said, "I have come to Beijing to resign." However, Chen Qitian said that Li was still considering it. When Chen said this, Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang both looked displeased. Li's movements have been extremely mysterious and intriguing for the two days he has been in Beijing. [Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Thirtieth of This Month] When asked about Li Huang's resignation as Minister of Economic Affairs, Zhang Qun replied to reporters, "I have not heard of it. This was agreed upon with the Youth Party in advance, and we are welcoming Li to participate."</p>

<h3>Wu Xianzi's Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] After arriving in Shanghai, Wu Xianzi, Vice Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, has been busy mediating internal party disputes. Yesterday, he issued the following statement: "I, Xianzi, saw reports in Hong Kong about internal disputes within the Democratic Socialist Party. At first, I did not believe them, but after learning that they were true, I was very surprised. I immediately sent a telegram to my party colleagues, asking them to calm down and seek a solution, and not to publish any more attacking remarks to the outside world, so as to increase the difficulties. After arriving in Shanghai on the 26th, I immediately visited various parties within the party and listened to their reports with a calm mind. I have never made any statements or comments to any party within the party. However, a certain newspaper reported yesterday that Xianzi "After meeting with Mr. Zhang Junmai, he reportedly told people that if it were 30 years ago in his youth, he would have slammed the table and shouted." Such records do not correspond to the facts. I sincerely hope that the press will not use speculative words to make inaccurate reports about the party's disputes, and I urge my party colleagues to think from a big picture perspective, calm their emotions, and not distort the facts or use them as propaganda to increase the difficulties of resolving the issue and confuse the public."</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Talks About Current Important Matters; Says There is No Reason to Be Pessimistic About the Economic Future; Currency Reform is Only a Matter of Time</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Thirtieth of This Month] At a cocktail reception for the Beijing and Shanghai press on the afternoon of the 30th, President Zhang said: "There is no reason to be pessimistic about the economic future. If we can make good use of our country's resources and potential, it will not be difficult to be self-reliant. The press is paying too much attention to loans, as if it would be difficult to revive the country without loans. The actual situation is not like this. Economic problems should be solved from an economic perspective, and we should not rely solely on political forces. I will ensure that the short-term and long-term measures I have proposed in the policy guidelines can be realized. Governing is not about empty talk or playing tricks. If we can take both short-term and long-term measures into consideration and work hard, we can achieve results. Currency reform is only a matter of time, but we cannot act rashly until all preparations are completed. Balancing the budget will be the main work goal of the government in the future." When reporters asked him to explain in detail the "Executive Yuan Responsibility System" and the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, Zhang said: "The Executive Yuan is a whole, and should be fully responsible." As for the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, the two institutions should maintain close contact. The Executive Yuan is the agency that implements the resolutions of the National Government Council, and the various laws and regulations drafted by the Executive Yuan must be completed through the legislative process by the Legislative Yuan. He believes that there will never be a situation of confrontation with the Legislative Yuan. Zhang attaches great importance to enhancing administrative efficiency, but said that increasing administrative efficiency cannot be achieved overnight. The problem of people, housing facilities, etc. are all related to it, and even the smallest details, such as a telephone, can affect administrative efficiency. He joked to reporters: "Please forgive me for not providing cigarettes and tea when you visit me in the future, because although this is a small detail, it is not very expensive, but it also affects administrative efficiency." Some Shanghai reporters hoped that Zhang could go to Shanghai for instructions. Zhang said: "I have been in the government for thirty years and come from the people, so I know the hardships of the people very well. In the future, I will do my best to relieve the suffering of the people. I have lived in Shanghai for two or thirty years, and I once served as the mayor of Shanghai, so I am very concerned about everything there. However, since the political capital is in Nanjing, there is no need for me to shuttle between Beijing and Shanghai. Even for the governor of the Central Bank, it is better to be stationed in the capital." Today's cocktail reception was the largest gathering of the press in the capital since the closing of the National Assembly. In addition to Zhang himself, government officials who attended included Gan Naiguang, Dong XianGuang, and Peng Xuepei. Over a hundred people from the press attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Zhao Junhao, Zhao Minheng, Xiao Tongzi, and Chen Bosheng. The reception began at 5:30 p.m. and ended happily at around 7:00 p.m.</p>

Organizing this new agency, formulating work plans, and determining the scope of work for each department will not be completed overnight.

The general military situation of the Nationalist army has greatly improved compared to three months ago.</p>
<p>Question: What measures are the government taking in response to current price fluctuations and the revival of the black market?</p>

<p>Question: Please explain the government's attitude towards the Taiwan Trade Bureau and the Monopoly Bureau. Will all monopoly measures be abolished?</p>
<p>Answer: The government has appointed Dr. Wei Daoming as the new chairman of Taiwan Province. He is consulting with the government authorities on the policy of governing Taiwan. At present, I can inform you that the economic policy of the province in the future will be based on the principle of 최대한 eliminating controls, and the solution of each problem is related to the overall situation of the province.</p>
<p>Question: Please explain the situation of the attack on the Wuhu newspaper office. Has the government taken steps to prevent such incidents from happening again?</p>
<p>Answer: The government is waiting for a report from the local authorities on the Wuhu newspaper office attack and is taking steps to prevent such incidents from happening again. The government has previously ordered local authorities to protect newspaper offices. If there are false reports, they should be addressed through legal channels and violence should not be used.</p>

<h3>U.S. Congressman Judd Urges Loan to China</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 29th Dispatch] Congressman Judd issued a statement advocating that the Export-Import Bank should immediately lend 500 million U.S. dollars to China, with conditions similar to the military and economic aid programs for Greece and Turkey. The period for granting or withdrawing this loan is only two months away, and the State Department is currently busy collecting opinions from all parties to decide how to handle it. According to reliable sources, the general view in Congress is that most people agree to extend the deadline of June 30 so that China has sufficient time to submit its plans for use, and then make a decision. However, Judd does not agree with this, and said that Sun Ke and Zhang Qun have now been appointed as Vice President of the Chinese National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan, which shows President Chiang's sincerity in "expanding the government." This is the prerequisite for the loan insisted upon by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall. However, according to the opinion of State Department officials, China has almost no chance of obtaining a specific loan by June 30, and it is stated that the State Department will still insist that China submit its plans for use before lending any part of the loan. Therefore, when China submits this plan next month, it will not be approved and a large amount of loan will be granted. Regarding the extension of the deadline, State Department officials also stated that they have not heard of it, and believe that at least a decision will not be made within two weeks.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Significance of Commemorating Labor Day</h3>
<p>Today is "May 1st" Labor Day, the 62nd Labor Day since 1886. The use of "May 1st" to commemorate labor is meant to remember the day that European and American workers fought and shed blood after the Industrial Revolution. This anniversary has great significance for the international labor movement. They use this as a goal to demand the unity of laborers and fight for survival, which has a mission of social evolution. Social evolution is inherently peaceful and gradual, but only the Communist Party mistakenly believes that social evolution must go through class struggle and bloodshed. Therefore, for half a century, the International Communist Party has stained the solemn "May 1st" with fresh blood. This anniversary has its great significance in China. The Chinese national spirit is peace and unity, and there is no class opposition in Chinese society, which is very different from the situation in Europe and America. We Chinese value labor very much, and therefore we also value "May 1st" Labor Day. Today, not only working people are enthusiastically welcoming this great anniversary, but also all Chinese people, regardless of gender or class, are enthusiastically welcoming this solemn anniversary.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation is the most diligent nation in the world, and this spirit of hard work is the embodiment of labor. China has respected labor since ancient times and regards labor as a virtue. The instructions of the sages are seen in the classics, such as the "Book of Rites": "Labor first, then reward;" the "Book of Changes" says: "Pleasing to the people first, the people forget their labor." Guanzi said: "Enrich the people by teaching them to labor;" the "Analects" says: "When there is something to do, the disciples take on the labor." This illustrates that China was the first to advocate labor and encouraged later generations to establish the country and conduct themselves with labor. Therefore, the Qing scholar Yan Xizhai said: "If one person moves, then one person is strong; if one family moves, then one family is strong; if one country moves, then one country is strong." Our country has not only always valued labor, but also valued the comfort and happiness after labor. Looking at the lunar calendar festivals: the spring scenery is pleasant, with the Qingming Festival for sweeping tombs in the suburbs; early summer is exhausting, with the Dragon Boat Festival for dragon boat races; the autumn is clear and refreshing, with the Mid-Autumn Festival for moon gazing; the harsh winter has just passed, and the minor spring turns, with a respite from agricultural work, there is the New Year's Day to the Lantern Festival for rest and celebration. This is a good inspiration, giving laborers rest and encouraging laborers to share joy and happiness. Comparing this with the origin of today's Labor Day, we can see that our commemoration of labor is based on historical origins and social customs; it is not for a certain class, nor for struggle and bloodshed. We hope that those who commemorate Labor Day clearly understand this point.</p>
<p>Our country values labor and commemorates Labor Day for the peace and happiness of all mankind and for the progress of the entire society, creating a happy and prosperous environment. Unfortunately, after the war, people's lives are difficult, industry and commerce are declining, and the unemployment crisis is becoming increasingly serious, leading to various social problems one after another. Individual lives and social stability are facing significant threats. Therefore, today, on Labor Day, we raise two major important issues: social problems and labor problems, and we ask for the attention of politicians and jurists, and the understanding of people in society.</p>
<p>The solution to social problems should focus on social security; the solution to labor problems should focus on protecting labor. Looking at the governments of various European and American countries in recent years, whether in the executive or judicial branches, they have carefully planned for social security and labor protection, reversing the previous protection of capitalism and instead protecting laborism. Our country was founded on labor, and today, in this era, we should pay close attention to these two major issues, considering the domestic situation and looking at external trends. The Constitution promulgated on New Year's Day this year, in its Chapter 13 on Basic National Policies, put forward the policies of social security and labor protection. This is an extremely far-reaching national policy. However, the provisions of the Constitution are limited to a listing of principles, and the specific implementation and details still require the completion of laws in the legislature and then progress in the administration to achieve good results. We believe that social security should not only focus on social insurance and social services, but also on full employment. Protecting labor should not only focus on factory inspections, wage adjustments, and labor-management coordination, but also on reasonable working hours, compensation, and the establishment of entertainment systems, which can be considered progressive legislation. If we can do this, the so-called social problems and labor problems will naturally not exist or develop. If we can do this, it also demonstrates that our emphasis on labor is consistent from beginning to end.</p>
<p>In short, "May 1st" Labor Day is a sacred and solemn anniversary. Its significance is renewed daily with social evolution, and its mission is increased with peaceful and happy life. "May 1st" Labor Day is always new and always a sacred and solemn festival!</p>

<h3>The General Assembly Steering Committee Unanimously Approves the British Proposal to Include it in the Agenda; Advocates the Establishment of a Holy Land Investigation Committee; the Arab Group's Request is Rejected</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Flushing Meadow, New York, April 29] The Steering Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting today and immediately unanimously agreed to include the British proposal in the agenda of the General Assembly and submit it to the Political Committee for consideration. The proposal advocates the establishment of an investigation committee responsible for studying the Palestine issue and submitting various recommendations when the United Nations holds a meeting in September. As for the Arab request to include the issues of Britain ending its trusteeship of Palestine and the independence of Palestine in the agenda of the General Assembly, it was rejected by the Steering Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Flushing, April 30] The efforts of five Arab countries to demand the termination of the British mandate and the independence of Palestine for immediate discussion by the United Nations Special Session seem to have failed today. As the Steering Committee prepares to reconvene at 11:00 AM this morning (midnight Shanghai time), the British and American delegations, supported by the Soviet Union, appear to have concentrated sufficient forces in the 14-nation Steering Committee to defeat the Arab countries' demand to make Palestine an independent state. Although Soviet representative Gromyko expressed sympathy for the Arab group's goal of making Palestine an independent democratic government, this action, coupled with the transformation of Latin American countries, which further supports the leadership of the United States, has actually guaranteed the failure of the Arab group's motion when the Steering Committee votes on it today. Currently, only Egypt and India are certain to vote in favor of adding the issues of trusteeship and independence to the agenda. The Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, Canada, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, and Equatorial Guinea have already announced their opposition. Although Poland has expressed its support, it will abstain from voting. Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, although able to attend and speak, have no voting rights.</p>
<p>The Arab group has formed a united front, and the statements of various countries are quite consistent. The main points can be summarized as follows: (1) The Covenant of the League of Nations allows the people of Class A mandate territories to eventually become independent. Since the British mandate over Palestine belongs to a Class A mandate, the freedom of Palestine is actually in the hands of Britain. Palestine's preparation for freedom is as unquestionable as that of other Class A mandate countries in the past, such as Syria, Lebanon, Outer Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. (2) Unless the United Nations acts quickly, the current terrorist disturbances in Palestine are bound to spread to the Near East and Middle East before September. (3) When Palestine has already been recognized as independent, refusing its independence violates the mandate system. The Arab countries continue to form a united front. Last night, the Arab League discussed whether the Arab delegation might vote against the establishment of an investigation team if their motions fail. The Soviet Union and Poland expressed their support for a full discussion of the issues of trusteeship and independence as requested by the Arabs, but both countries also stated that they would rather debate this issue after the investigation rather than before the investigation. The US position, which is likely to be supported by the majority, is that all countries deeply hope for the independence of Palestine, but there are still conflicting opinions between Arabs and Jews on the form of independence to be adopted.</p>
<h3>Marshall Meets with Austin; US Opposes Jewish Representatives Having the Right to Speak</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, April 29] A State Department spokesman said that Secretary of State Marshall will meet with Austin, the US representative to the United Nations, tomorrow to discuss the policies of the United Nations and the debate on the Palestine issue at the Special General Assembly. Austin is scheduled to leave New York for the capital tonight.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, April 30] According to reliable sources today, the US delegation opposes allowing any Jewish representatives to attend and speak when the United Nations Special Session discusses the Palestine issue, unless there are unexpected changes in the situation. According to the US delegation, since the United Nations is organized by countries, only national representatives have the right to attend and speak at the General Assembly. If Jewish groups have opinions, they can only submit them in writing or attend the investigation committee for questioning.</p>
<h3>Jewish Terrorist Groups Ceasefire During the UN Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, April 29] Jewish officials said that the Jewish terrorist groups Irgun and Stern Gang in Palestine, under pressure from American Jews, have agreed to cease action against British forces during the Special General Assembly convened by the United Nations. However, the two Jewish terrorist groups have not yet announced this intention.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Dispute; Egypt Plans to Appeal to the Security Council</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Cairo, April 29] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy recently announced that after the UN Special Session discusses the Palestine issue, Egypt will submit the Anglo-Egyptian dispute to the Security Council for discussion.</p>
<h3>Dulles Reports on the Foreign Ministers' Conference; Says the US Will Not Hesitate to Take Unilateral Action</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, April 29] Dulles, an advisor to Secretary of State Marshall and a prominent Republican, returned with Marshall from Moscow and gave a broadcast speech today reporting on the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He said that this conference has at least contributed to the determination of future US foreign policy. The reason why the Moscow conference could not reach an agreement on important issues was due to the attitude of the Soviet Union. A Germany restored according to the Soviet plan not only presents the danger of Germany becoming a highly industrialized country, but also the risk of Germany becoming a Soviet factory. If the Soviet Union's ideals are put into practice, Austria will be reduced to a puppet state. The US delegation has established a closer relationship with France in Moscow this time, and the United States will not hesitate to take unilateral decisions in the future, which seems necessary for the welfare of Europe.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Lend-Lease Accounts; The US Only Wants the Soviet Union to Repay Part of it</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, April 29] Regarding the Soviet Union's repayment of US Lend-Lease debts, reliable sources here recently said that the total value of materials lent by the United States to the Soviet Union during the war was 11 billion US dollars, and the United States only requires repayment of a small part of it. The US does not want to be repaid for materials of a purely military nature or those destroyed during the war, and what it wants to be repaid for is industrial materials, now used by the Soviet Union to implement its five-year plan, estimated to be worth about 4.5 billion US dollars.</p>
<h3>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Unanimously Passes the US Foreign Aid Bill; The House of Representatives Plans to Reduce it to $200 Million</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, April 29] Regarding the US bill to provide $350 million in aid to China, Greece, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and Austria, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a meeting to discuss it and it was unanimously passed. Afterwards, the chairman of the committee, Republican Senator Vandenberg, told the press that the Trieste area is also within the scope of this aid plan. In addition, it has been learned that when the House Foreign Affairs Committee met to discuss this aid bill, Republican Congressman Junkman proposed an amendment to reduce the aid to $200 million, which was passed by a vote of 165 to 138. Some congressmen wanted to restrict aid to countries controlled by the Soviet Union, but the Foreign Affairs Committee refused to accept this request. It is expected that the Senate will try to restore this aid plan to its original state as proposed by President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and State Department Assistant Clayton.</p>
<h3>US-Turkish Agreement; May be Signed Soon; The US Sells Airports to Greece</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Turkish Capital, April 29] Regarding the US aid plan to Turkey, the agreement between the two countries can be signed after negotiations between US and Turkish diplomats.

<p>[United Press, Athens, April 29] It is reported that the US military and the Greek government signed an agreement today to sell the airports built or rebuilt by the US military to Greece. US Ambassador MacVeagh flew to Washington today for official business after discussing the loan to Greece.</p>
<h3>Mexican President Visits the United States; The Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries are Further Consolidated</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, April 29] Mexican President Alemán arrived here today on President Truman's private plane, receiving the warmest welcome in the US capital. President Truman and his cabinet members and senior US officials personally greeted him. All government employees also participated in the welcome. The two presidents and their entourage rode in cars from the airport to the White House. An estimated 250,000 Washington residents lined the streets to welcome him. Mexican and American flags fluttered alternately along the way, and the decorations at the entrances of major buildings expressed the country's warm welcome to the President of its southern neighbor. President Truman, who greeted Alemán at the airport, said, "I am welcoming not only the President of Mexico, but also a close friend."</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, April 29] Mexican President Alemán arrived in the United States for a visit today. President Truman personally welcomed him and said that the friendly relations between the two countries are sufficient to prove the spiritual strength of Pan-Americanism and also sufficient to prove that all countries in the Western Hemisphere can peacefully resolve all disputes. President Alemán immediately replied that the Mexican people firmly believe in democracy, and this democratic thought has united the people of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<h3>Settle the Blood Debt; Trotsky's Wife Asks the Court to Subpoena Stalin</h3>

<h3>Report on the Moscow Conference Proceedings - Full Text of Marshall's Speech (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Foreign Ministers' Conference participants apparently all agreed to establish a self-sufficient and democratic Germany, with various restrictions to prevent Germany from rearming.</p>
<p>Excessive Centralization of Power in the German Government is Inadvisable</p>
<p>The Central Government Issue - The degree of centralization of the future German government is an extremely important issue. It is understood that in a country like Germany, individual rights and association rights traditionally lack sufficient strength to control the exercise of government power. If power is excessively concentrated, it would be very dangerous. The Soviet Union seems to favor a strong central government. The United States and Britain oppose this type of government because it could easily transform into a regime similar to the Nazi group. Britain and the United States advocate strict limitations on the scope of power of the central government, with other powers reserved for the states or provinces. As for France's proposal, the central government should only have very limited responsibilities. They fear that the trick of Hitler's regime seizing national power in 1933 will be repeated tomorrow.</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances, countries always have differing opinions on the nature of government restructuring. However, in this case, it is mixed with a reasonable fear of the resurgence of German military power, as well as anxiety about the open or hidden desires of those with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Germany's Economy - Regarding the nature of Germany's economic system and its relationship with Europe, various disagreements are even more serious and difficult to reconcile. Currently, Germany's economy is crippled due to the lack of unified action, and it is necessary to make an immediate decision to rebuild Germany to a self-sufficient state.</p>
<p>Regarding the desire for German economic unification, all parties unanimously declared their agreement, but when it came to discussing the practical conditions for managing this unification, everyone held their own views. One of the most serious difficulties encountered in the effort to achieve economic unification is the go-it-alone policy within the Soviet occupation zone, which disregards other occupation zones, and even if there are reports, very little is known about what is happening within the Soviet occupation zone. They have no intention of cooperation and refuse to declare the food situation and the extent and nature of the reparations taken from the Soviet occupation zone.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is Unwilling to Cooperate in the Economic Merger of Germany</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's unwillingness to cooperate with us in establishing a balanced German economy in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement is the biggest obstacle to achieving a self-sufficient Germany capable of supplying its neighboring countries with coal and other essential goods. The coal and other essential goods of Germany's neighboring countries were originally mostly supplied by Germany. Britain and the United States have worked hard to win Soviet cooperation in this regard, but to no avail. Therefore, the two occupation zones of Britain and the United States merged to improve the German economic situation, which allows the free circulation of materials and products in the two occupation zones to achieve a regulatory effect. This merger has been relentlessly criticized by the Soviet Union, which believes that this is a violation of the Potsdam Agreement and a step towards splitting Germany. The Soviet Union's refusal to implement the agreement is the only reason for the merger, but the Soviet Union has failed to understand this point. We have no choice but to view it this way: the Soviet Union's criticism has no other intention than to cover up the fact that they have failed to fulfill the Potsdam Agreement on unifying the German economy. There is no doubt that if we take certain steps towards German economic unification, it will be much better than not taking any steps at all.</p>
<p>The issue of the nature of the control of the Ruhr industrial zone (Europe's largest coal-producing area and heavy industrial zone) is still the subject of debate. We should not decide on it merely for the sake of reaching an agreement, because extremely important considerations and future consequences are related to it. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Improving Calculation Index - Seeking Thorough Resolution - Wu Kaixian and Shui Xiangyun Express Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian and General Labor Union Chairman Shui Xiangyun yesterday spoke separately with reporters about the cost of living index issue.</p>
<p>Drafting a Plan - Awaiting Adoption</p>
<p>Director Wu stated: He holds great determination to seek a thorough solution. The Labor-Management Appraisal Committee small group meeting is scheduled to be held on May 3rd. At that time, relevant organizations such as the Industrial Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union will be invited to attend. During the meeting, the opinions of each attendee on this issue will be solicited, compiled, and then another meeting will be convened to decide on a plan to recommend to the central government for adoption. If Minister Gu is still in Shanghai at that time, he will be invited to attend the meeting. Director Wu also stated: It is rumored that the types of daily necessities used to calculate the differential allowance will be increased, but he has not considered it. Director Wu stated that he has drafted a plan, which will be studied and discussed with Minister Gu after he comes to Shanghai, and will await adoption by the central government. It cannot be publicly released at present.</p>
<p>Suggesting Seeking - A Democratic Approach</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun stated: From a general perspective, it is inevitable that the index will be unfrozen. However, it is still impossible to unfreeze it completely. Currently, the opinions of various parties on this issue can be summarized as follows: (1) Those with a base salary of less than 50 yuan will have the index restored, and those with a base salary of more than 50 yuan will have it calculated with a discount. (2) The cost of living index will use the January figure of 8,000 times as the base, and then be issued with discounts according to the circumstances of each industry. (3) Conduct a class survey and separately assess wages for each industry. (4) Increase the types of goods used to calculate the differential allowance. It is still undecided which method the central government will choose to compensate workers' livelihoods. The General Labor Union, imprisoned and assessed the different situations of labor, management, and the government, and each has its own difficulties. All parties speak subjectively and neglect objective conditions and the environment. Therefore, it is suggested that the Social Affairs Bureau convene a talk between the government, the capital side, and the labor side to seek a solution in a democratic way. The fact that workers cannot maintain their livelihoods, that some factories will announce their closure, and that the government is in a difficult situation are all facts. Why don't we speak frankly and seek solutions together? The Social Affairs Bureau has adopted this suggestion and will convene this three-party talk after the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee opens a meeting on the issue of unfreezing the index on May 3rd. At that time, labor and management will each have more than ten representatives attending, and the government representatives will be the heads of various competent authorities.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Director Wu spoke with reporters yesterday: 'The factors that cause price increases and decreases are raw materials, sales channels, productivity, interest rates, and wages. Therefore, wages are only a small part of prices. If the cost of living index suddenly returns from more than 7,900 times in January to the current level it should be, he believes that it will not stimulate prices. And prices are absolutely sufficient to determine wages.'</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Garrison Command's Yarn and Cloth Group announced yesterday that it had investigated and found three yarn and cloth companies illegally operating, and had imposed penalties of suspending yarn distribution and purchasing the yarn at the original price by the government: (1) Yan Changyong Yarn Shop, No. 373, 26 Zhongzheng East Road, after receiving yarn distributed by China Textile Corporation, privately transported it for sale to the South China area for profit.

<h3>Young Woman Dies Tragically by the Blade in Houjiabang</h3>
<p>Love Triangle Leads to Murder - The Murderer Xu A’gui was Immediately Arrested - Details of the Incident Given, Love Rival on the Run</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In front of the Dianye Public Office at No. 38 Wujia Lane, Houjiabang, in the city, at around 10:30 a.m. yesterday, a young woman was murdered at that location. Afterward, upon receiving the report, Deputy Chief Shen Deting and Chen Jingshan of the Yimiao Police Precinct personally led Criminal Section Chief Zhou Nan, section members Mai Wenlin, police chief Bai Faxiang, and police officers Gu Zhicheng, Li Xuewei, Ju Bin, Zhang Minghui, Chen Yuzhi, and Patrolman Yang Yiyi of the Fuyou Road Police Station to surround and search the area. They finally arrested the murderer Xu A’gui and brought him to the station.</p>
<p>According to the confession: The deceased was Wen Shunna, from Zhenze Town, Wujiang County, 26 years old. She had a husband named Xu Jinsheng in her hometown, who worked as a farmer. She had been carrying on an affair with him for about ten years. For this, she had sold two mu of cloud fields and a boat. In February of this year, they came to Shanghai together. Because it was difficult to find a house, she lived in the home of a fellow villager, Shen Hesheng, at No. 39 Wujia Lane, in the city, and made a living selling pickled mustard greens. The deceased was employed as a maid at No. 27 Zhengxiang Lane, Fangbang Road. The two still visited each other from time to time. The landlady of the Tan Maoxing anvil shop at No. 246 Pingjili Road, Tan Fei, was the sister-in-law of Shen Hesheng's wife. They often went back and forth, and the deceased got to know this old woman as a result. They talked congenially, and Madam Tan induced the deceased to have a relationship with her son, Tan Lianqian. Over time, he became very angry. Recently, because of a lack of capital for selling</p>
<p>discovered</p>
<p>pickled mustard greens, he returned to his hometown to raise funds. She also went with him. After delaying for a few days, they agreed to return to Shanghai on a certain day. Unexpectedly, the deceased left one day early. He tracked her down the next morning and arrived here. After discovering that the deceased had arrived in Shanghai that day, he went to Tan Maoxing to stay for the night. The night before, he had gone to the shop to visit her and was insulted by Tan Fei and her son. This aroused his intention to kill the woman. Before leaving, he agreed to meet at a teahouse in Laoximen at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to</p>
<p>reason</p>
<p>and invited the deceased, Wen Shunna, to attend and break off the relationship. Later, he heard that the other party had invited people, so he hesitated. Suddenly, Tan Fei, Wen Shunna, and Tan Xueqian (shop assistant) took a streetcar with two men in suits to Shen Hesheng's house to reason with him. The deceased's attitude was tough, which made his anger even more difficult to suppress. After a few minutes of negotiations, he invited the deceased out to talk. As soon as they reached the side of the road at the entrance of the lane, he took out a sharp blade (a fruit knife purchased from Zhang Dalong Scissors Shop on Yan Hai Road for 5,000 yuan in the early morning) and</p>
<p>stabbed</p>
<p>the deceased once in the left chest and once in the mouth. At that time, the deceased ran five or six steps with the wound and fell to the ground and died due to the vital parts being injured. At the same time, he ran away but was chased by Tan Xueqian and others. The police also surrounded the area, making it impossible for him to escape.</p>
<p>During the struggle, Tan's right rib was also stabbed with a knife, and the blood flowed non-stop. Fortunately, it was still minor. Later, he surrendered himself to the hospital for treatment. The deceased, Wen Shunna, was sent to Tongren Fuyuantang by car to await a report from the District Attorney's Office to send personnel for inspection. The murderer, Xu A’gui, Tan Fei, and others are now being held in the police station, awaiting the arrest of the fugitive Tan Lianqian for joint investigation.</p>

<h3>An Ideal Couple - Actually in China?</h3>
<p>Mrs. Yang Enqi Says This - Separate for a Week Every Three Months</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mrs. Yang Siqi, representative of the Paris Evening News, gave a public lecture at the Lyceum Theatre yesterday with the theme of "Traveling Around the World to Seek an Ideal Couple."</p>
<p>Mrs. Yang said: She traveled to the ends of the earth but could not find an ideal couple. Finally, she came to China and finally found them. This couple told her that there was no secret, it was very simple - they must separate for a week every three months to let the whole family rest. During this week, if it is necessary to talk, use words instead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yang has only been in China for a few months, and she has already discovered an ideal couple in China. I wonder if the compatriots who grew up in the motherland have also had the same discovery? Whether or not the ideal couple cited by Mrs. Yang is considered suitable for reality and is agreed upon can only be answered by the readers themselves.</p>
<h3>Impersonating to Seize Enemy Property - Zheng Desheng Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zheng Desheng, a suspect in the instigation of the assassination of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shishi Daily, was recently reported to the Ministry of National Defense by hardware merchant Chai Yonglie and firewood merchant Ruan Teng, who said that Zheng had used the name of a major general counselor of the Military Commission at the beginning of the victory to seize the Anli warehouse on Beizhe Jiangxi Road, Tiantong Road, and the Wujing Yanghang warehouse on Chengdu Road, Nanjing West Road, which stored more than 100 tons of enemy property such as electrical materials, copper wire, and steel. The Ministry of National Defense sent the case to the Shanghai High Procuratorate for investigation. Because Zheng was detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center for the assassination of Huang Bohui, he is currently being questioned and investigated by the District Procuratorate under the instruction of the High Procuratorate. Yesterday, the original informant Chai Yonglie was specially summoned for questioning, and Zheng was also summoned for interrogation. The defendant Zheng Desheng is a major criminal involved in two cases, and was returned to custody after interrogation.</p>
<h3>Indictment of Five Japanese and Korean War Criminals - Including Elements Who Used False Names to Form a Party to Plot Misconduct - Torture and Coercion to Confess, Cruel Harm to Our Compatriots</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Five war criminals were indicted by the military court yesterday: (1) Ikezaki Michinari, who served as the branch manager of Shanghai Meifeng Foreign Company, the deputy manager of East Asia Trading Company, and other positions. In July 1944, under the command of the "Ordnance Factory of the China Expeditionary Army Headquarters" of Japan, he organized a "party organ," served as the head of the organ, operated military supplies production, and manufactured hand grenades for the enemy army. After the end of the war, he used the pseudonym Tang Zhen, mixed into the Third Advance Army Headquarters of the Soviet-Zhejiang-Anhui Military Commission as a major staff officer, secretly organized the Yamato Party, and planned to recruit fugitive Japanese troops in the Soviet-Zhejiang provinces after surrender to plot misconduct. He was detected by the former Third Front Army Jinghu Area Prisoner of War Management Office, detained, and sent to the military court for trial. (2) Korean Jiang Jianghu, formerly the chief of the Special High Department of the Weijing Police Bureau in Muping County, Shandong Province. In 1944, our guerrilla team Sun Zhenxian's team killed a Japanese in Xitanjiabo Village in the county. The criminal arrested the village chief Liu Kunji and subjected him to torture such as hanging and waterboarding, forcing him to confess the hiding place of our guerrillas who killed the Japanese, and imprisoned him for more than 20 days before releasing him. After the victory, he was detained by the Qingdao Garrison Command and brought to justice. (3) Former Mochi Yuzuru, the captain of the squadron of the Qingdao Naval Special Base Fleet of the Japanese Navy, and (4) Fujiwara Keisuke, a third-class machine gunner of the first detachment, killed our government workers and innocent people. He often tied the convicts to trees and instructed the team soldiers to either chop off their heads with sharp blades or stab them with bayonets, which was extremely cruel. (5) Former Sergeant Major Kurakoshi Hakuji of the Shanghai Military Police Headquarters arrested Su Jiarong, an underground worker, and used torture to force him to confess, which was inhumane.</p>
<h3>Dai Anguo and Others Fly to the United States This Morning - To Attend the International Aviation Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Senior Chinese aviation officials Dai Anguo, Yi Fuen, and 17 others will take a special plane of the China National Aviation Corporation at 7:00 a.m. this morning to fly to the United States to attend the International Aviation Conference to be held in Canada next month. The special plane will fly along the Sino-US route planned to be opened by China National Aviation Corporation, stopping briefly in Guam, Wake Island, Midway Island, and Honolulu.

<h3>Sinan Road Detention Center - Overcrowded - Sudden Increase in Criminals - Panic Over Prisoner Food - Currently Negotiating Purchase with the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the Sinan Road Detention Center in this city handled the amnesty at the end of January this year, two-thirds of the prisoners originally in the prison have been released, leaving only 749 people at the minimum. However, since the beginning of spring, the number of criminals has suddenly increased. Many of the criminals who were released after the amnesty have returned one after another because they have committed crimes again. As of yesterday, the total number of prisoners in the office reached 2,073, exceeding the number before the amnesty. All the prison cells are full, and an average of 50 or 60 new criminals are constantly being sent in every day. There are not enough prison cells to be distributed, so the newly imprisoned people have to temporarily settle in the corridor. The more serious problem is that the prisoner food will also be insufficient. Director Tian Lixun told reporters yesterday that the office currently has enough rice to last only one day, and there is a danger of having no rice to cook tomorrow. Director Tian went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to visit Director Wu Kaixian the day before yesterday and applied to purchase 1,000 zu of red rice to supply the four institutions of the Detention Center, the Temporary Detention Center, the Shanghai Prison, and the High Court Temporary Detention Center. Yesterday, he contacted Ji Mingzhai, Section Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. Because rice prices have been soaring for days, the Social Affairs Bureau is planning to sell a large amount of its existing rice reserves to try to suppress the price, so it is not yet known whether the 1,000 dan of prisoner food can be fully approved. However, according to Director Tian, even if it cannot be fully purchased, a small amount must be handled, and a tragedy of food shortages may not occur. Director Tian also informed that each prisoner is given 20 taels of food per day, and currently consumes about 17 dan of rice per day, and said that the shortage of food this time is because the number of people decreased after the amnesty, and not much was prepared, and after the number of prisoners suddenly increased in the past half month, it coincided with the soaring food prices, resulting in an unprecedented food shortage. According to the office's food account, there is already no grain left. The remaining rice today is the surplus from the previous month. He also said that fortunately, the prisoner food expenses can be reimbursed according to the actual situation, otherwise it would be impossible to raise funds.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Shen Junru, the "transgender person" arrested by the Municipal Police Bureau in a den discovered at No. 1327 Fuxing Middle Road, Elizabeth Apartment, and the deceived women Zhou Shuzhen, Ding Baoshu, and Fan Guanheng, along with the "transgender person's" personal maids Xu Aqiao and Zhang Xiuzhen, were transferred to the District Court on the 28th on charges of drug offenses and offenses against public morals. They were detained in the temporary detention center for women attached to the District Court. The detention center, considering the special nature of the "transgender person," did not allow them to be mixed with other inmates and instead kept them in a "special room" individually. The court has dispatched a forensic doctor to examine the "transgender person's" physiological condition, and the results prove that the "transgender person" is a normal woman and has no special abnormalities. It is reported that when ordered to change into women's clothing upon entering prison, the "transgender person" insisted on refusing because they had no women's clothing. The detention center ordered them to wear prison clothes. After hearing this, the three deceived women each took off their own clothes and gave them to the "transgender person," and pleaded on their behalf to avoid being forced to change into prison clothes. Zhou Shuzhen, Ding Baoshu, and Fan Guanheng are all abandoned women, wealthy widows, who possess huge amounts of property. After being detained, their relatives sent them exquisite dishes. The three women transferred part of their own food to the "transgender person." Zhou, Ding, and Fan's actions of sharing food and clothes in this way prove that they are still deluded. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter went to the temporary detention center and saw the "transgender person" wearing a light green short jacket, purple long pants, and black soft satin men's cloth-bottomed shoes, pacing back and forth in the room. Because the clothing was neither one thing nor another, it was quite laughable to look at. When they noticed someone coming to visit, they immediately burrowed into the quilt and covered their head, seemingly knowing shame and being afraid of being seen. According to the court, the case will be tried in a few days. The drug offense part is still awaiting court appraisal, and it will be difficult to grant bail to the three women, Ding, Zhou, and Fan, before the trial concludes.</p>

<h3>China Reclaims Victory Over America, Wins Roosevelt Cup, Reversing Defeat in the Last Two Minutes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The second fierce battle of the Roosevelt Cup Sino-American basketball tournament was held last night at the city gymnasium, with over three thousand spectators. Throughout the game, the American team consistently led, disappointing the audience. Unexpectedly, in the last two minutes, the Chinese team awoke like a sleeping lion, reversing the situation with a score of sixty to fifty-seven, defeating the American team and winning the championship. The audience's worries turned to joy, and they were ecstatic. The Chinese team frequently adjusted its lineup due to being at a disadvantage, while the American team ultimately suffered the consequences of "carelessness losing Jingzhou." For thirty-eight minutes, the Chinese team had little to commend, with a scattered and disorganized state often seen. Only in the last two minutes did they show their true colors. Good luck also played a significant role.</p>
<p>The game started at 7:35 PM. Both sides began with the same lineup as in the first game. The audience frequently urged the teams on, with applause and cheers rising together. Upon initial contact, Brochie of the American team immediately scored five points. Chen Xuechong of the Chinese team made a basket from the left corner. Brochie attacked again, and with no one guarding him, he easily scored another basket. Following this, Trimier scored, making it 9-2. The Chinese team had to reorganize, replacing Liu Fushan with Cai Yanxiong. The Chinese team's situation gradually improved, but they committed numerous fouls, all of which were converted into points by the opponent, making it 15-6. Liu and Cai switched again. Bao Songyuan added three points, and the American team called a timeout. Wu Chengzhang's shot was accurate, making it 17-13, closing the gap. When Whiteford replaced Asche at fifteen minutes, Chen Xuechong received excellent support from Zhenzhong, making it 19-18, only one point behind. The American team called another timeout. Asche re-entered, and with excellent teamwork, added seven points, reaching twenty-six. The audience worried for the Chinese team. The first half ended with a score of 30-21, with the American team leading by nine points. During the intermission, the Mayor's Cup awards were presented. The Mayor was absent, so Section Chief Zhang Peter of the Social Affairs Bureau represented him. The Columbus team, champions of the men's division, was led by Brochie to receive the award. The entire team smiled broadly, expressing their appreciation and joy for the silver cup.</p>
<p>The second half began with Lao Bao intercepting Brochie's high ball under the basket. He passed the ball to Cai Yanxiong, who quickly passed it to Xuechong, who scored. The action was crisp, and the audience was very satisfied. At 33-25, Zhenzhong was replaced by Fushan. Brussie's sprinting made the Chinese generals dumbfounded. At 39-26, the Chinese team called their fifth timeout. Asche was so agile that sometimes two people could hardly contain him. When the scoreboard clock pointed to thirty minutes, the score was 49-32. Lin Weicong replaced Cai Yanxiong, and Ma Canxi replaced Chen Xuechong. The Chinese team's score, after the rapid chase by Lin, Li, etc., showed signs of revival. At 53-44, Oberlin "graduated," and Little John replaced him. Ren Zhang, Songyuan, Xuechong, Lao Bao, etc., fought hard to tie the score at 53. At the last two minutes, Wu Chengzhang scored a basket, exceeding the score by two points. Asche made it 55-55. Big John committed a foul, and Chengzhang made one free throw. Xuechong scored, reversing the situation to 58-55. The atmosphere in the gymnasium was wild. Little John scored a basket, increasing the score to 57. Cai Yanxiong scored the final basket, and the game ended. The Chinese team reversed the defeat with a score of 60-57.</p>

<p>Our Factory Soybean Oil Jumps 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the edible oil market continued to rise sharply, with prices for all types of edible oil reaching new highs. Soybean oil from our factory was 580,000 yuan, up 30,000 yuan. Qingdao Jeep barrel raw oil was 600,000 yuan, up 20,000 yuan. Pure raw oil was 550,000 yuan, up 20,000 yuan. Prices in the production areas also continued to rise. Wuxi was 630,000 yuan, Changzhou was 620,000 yuan, and Qingdao was 430,000 yuan. Although Yingkou was cheaper, transportation was difficult, and even if goods were shipped out, most were transported to the North China Tianjin area for sales. Private oil factories in the city all felt a shortage of raw materials, resulting in low production volumes and even lower sales. If oil were extracted at the current raw material prices, the income from oil extraction would only be enough to cover the raw material costs, leaving nothing for labor and other expenses. In Bengbu, Hankou, and other places, the quality of raw materials was inferior, but the face sales price was even higher, making it impossible to use.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Merchants Plan to Form a Joint Management Office</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In response to the recent soaring oil prices in Shanghai, the Shanghai Edible Oil Commercial Guild believes that the edible oil allocation office is unable to cope. Therefore, they plan to establish a joint edible oil management office and have submitted a request to Mayor Wu for approval. The planned joint edible oil management office will be based on all wholesale group members of the Edible Oil Guild, targeting retail group members. The fixed capital is 100 million yuan, with shares divided into different levels and paid in installments. Subsequently, all edible oil produced by Chinese-owned oil factories and private factories in the city will be purchased by the Guild's joint management office at negotiated prices and distributed to all retail group members and members of the sauce garden and brewing industry guilds. If there is a shortage, the wholesale group members will be responsible for transportation to ensure supply.</p>
<p>Allocation Office to Expand Organization</p>
<p>The fourth meeting of the National Economic Council decided to stabilize edible oil prices in Shanghai. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, the China Plant Oil Factory of the Ministry of Food, the China Edible Oil Company, and the Oil Extraction Industry Guild will jointly establish a unified allocation office for edible oil. Yesterday, a telegram with the reference number Jingwu Zi 16 was sent to the city government, requesting investigation and handling. The Social Affairs Bureau's supervisor, Li, will expand the organization of the edible oil allocation office within the week and uniformly register retail shops. The total number of retail shops currently allocated by the allocation office and China Plant Oil Company is 1,800. After review, this number will be reduced to 800.</p>
<p>Northeast Soybeans Arrive Within Days</p>
<p>Another report: The first batch of 6,000 tons of soybeans purchased in the Northeast by the China Trust Bureau and various banks will arrive in Shanghai within days. It is said that this batch of soybeans is specifically for oil extraction by Shanghai oil factories.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the China Trust Bureau has only completed two soybean trades with foreign countries. One is with Italy, amounting to 13,200 tons, and the other is with the Netherlands, amounting to 5,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Depleted Sources, Scarce Arrivals, Rice Prices Reach New Peak, Flour and Grains Also Increase Linearly</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Rice, beans, flour, and grains all rose sharply yesterday, reaching new highs. Black market white japonica rice exceeded 200,000 yuan, and white yuan reached 230,000 yuan. Due to chaotic price increases in the production areas and depleted sources, only 1,315 shi arrived at the city market yesterday. Samples from various sources were almost completely exhausted, and market transactions were virtually suspended. Apart from a small amount of allocated rice for door-to-door sales, most rice shops were empty. The Social Affairs Bureau released a total of 9,000 bags of white rice and Siamese rice into the market yesterday. Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai from Beijing this morning and is expected to bring back countermeasures for the city's food problem from the National Price Conference.</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau analyzed the reasons for the rising prices to reporters yesterday, believing that it was not due to artificial factors. The government has very strict controls on this, and with the rainy season approaching soon, no one dares to hoard large quantities.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat flour rose to 130,000 yuan, a jump of 13,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Domestic flour was 89,000 yuan, up 7,500 yuan. Dalian green beans were 163,000 yuan, 23,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Pudong Du beans were 185,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan higher. Bran was 69,000 yuan, up 6,000 yuan. Jiangbei corn was 89,000 yuan, up 9,000 yuan. Chongming sand red beans were 195,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. Changzi soybean cake was 56,000 yuan, up 4,500 yuan. Yingkou soybean cake was 88,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Increase Slightly Calmed</h3>
<p>The sugar market's rising trend slightly calmed yesterday, but still increased by ten thousand to several thousand yuan. Peruvian fine sand was 428,000 to 4,000 yuan, up ten thousand to six thousand yuan. Coarse white and medium sand also increased by about ten thousand yuan. Green sugar was relatively flat. Shantou green sugar had no Xuan Qing, Gao Shunde green was 260,000 yuan, followed by 255,000 yuan, Diao Qing was 242,000 to 250,000 yuan, Gao Xinghua white was 420,000 to 400,000 yuan, Gao Xinghua red was 330,500 yuan to 300,000 yuan, and Extra Gao Shantou white was 440,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Additional Collateral for Tea Leaves Reaches 16 Billion</h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank has been handling additional collateral loans for tea merchants for a month. It is reported that the bank has lent out more than 16 billion yuan to date. Only a small portion of the tea leaves from last year's tea loans has not been processed for additional collateral. It is expected to be completed next week, with the total additional collateral loan being around 20 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Longjing Declines Openly, Flat Secretly</h3>
<p>New Hangzhou Longjing tea continues to arrive, but it is all from the third or fourth batches, and the quality is far inferior to the previous fresh and tender teas. Therefore, the prices offered by traders to each other have been reduced again, but the underlying trend is that the decline continues openly while remaining stable in secret. Other varieties still only include the 1946 Bailin black tea. The Yingkou gang is still inquiring, but the rest are not selling well, and the situation remains unchanged. The foreign tea market's appetite remains narrow, and the attitude is stubborn. They are selective, so negotiations are difficult to succeed, and the volume of transactions is not exciting. The market is still inflated as before.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Banking Association, Li Fusun, Takes Office</h3>
<p>After the National Banking Association Joint Conference closed in Beijing, it held a temporary board of directors meeting at the Shanghai Banking Association yesterday (30th). More than 30 directors and supervisors attended. Mr. Du Yuesheng served as the temporary chairman and unanimously welcomed Chairman Li Fusun to take office. Mr. Li delivered an inaugural speech on the spot and then presided over the meeting to continue discussing the progress of the association's affairs. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Cotton Fabric Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton fabric market initially saw strong rumors that cotton yarn prices would be raised, causing the market to surge. The Four Gentlemen, Golden Seal, and Yuan Biji fabrics were widely absorbed, with prices reaching as high as 242,000 yuan. Holders still planned to maintain prices. Twenty-count unlicensed fine cloth rose from 219,000 yuan to 242,000 yuan due to limited allocations from the Textile Construction Company the day before. Leading fine cloth also rose to 270,000 yuan. Other white and colored fabrics, such as Shilin, all showed stability.</p>
<h3>Market Sentiment Firm, Chinese Stocks Continue to Advance</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks remained firm yesterday. Silk prices soared, and secondary and miscellaneous stocks continued to advance, bringing up Yong yarn as well, which was relatively cheap. The key issue for the future will be the money supply.</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, all stocks rose, except for Deli Yong yarn. After the opening, 231, 153, 78, 97, 98, and 125 were offered for sale, falling from 4,900 yuan to 4,800 yuan. The Meea and other secondary stocks were initially reported lower but then rose steadily. 153, 76, 112, 116, 117, 226, 223, 106, 4, 13, 89, 142, 129, and 224 took the opportunity to buy, gradually rising back to 5,000 yuan. 117 and 160 settled, showing slight fluctuations. When China Silk and Five Harmony reached their limit, 106, 117, 4, 94, 89, 95, and 224 further advanced to 5,080 yuan. 14 and 95 advanced again to 5,100 yuan. New Asia also announced a price freeze. 163, 91, 107, and 137 settled at high prices, falling back to 4,980 yuan. 126, 106, 95, 231, and 89 all advanced. At noon, Deli Yong yarn was raised to around 5,150 yuan and then stabilized slightly. After the close, the asking price was raised to 5,180 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ji Yong yarn, Meea, New China, and Hua Feng each rose by more than half a percent.

Among the cold stocks, China Silk and New Asia hit the limit, domestic underwear was stable, Tong Yi rose slightly, and Five Harmony hit the limit. The remaining stocks each rose by more than half a percent.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, only spot transactions were conducted. China Silk, New Asia, Rongfeng, and Commercial Affairs first announced price freezes.

Under the support of 223, 145, and 105, there were rumors of differences in the four lines and two bureaus. After 3 o'clock, it rose again to 5,300 yuan. This news was actually a false rumor. 215, 60, 177, and 62 successively sold off, forcing the price down to a low of 5,190 yuan before stabilizing. It rose slightly after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Qin Xing, New China, and Yong Gong hit the limit, Sino-French rose by 10%, Xinyi and Meea rose slightly less than 10%, and Yong yarn, Jingfu, and Hua Feng rose by slightly more than half a percent. New Light rose slightly. There was only half a day of trading for deferred delivery.

<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Stimulates, Foreign Stocks Rebound</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks rose after initially falling yesterday, mainly because the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate narrowed again. Jardine Matheson opened at 600,000 yuan, rose from 603,000 yuan, was pressured down to 591,000 yuan by securities firms and retail buyers settling. The Guangdong gang came in and stabilized, then was stimulated by the Hong Kong exchange rate, approaching 610,000 yuan at the close in the afternoon. Trading of Jardine Matheson was quite lively. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, British United, and Kaiping Paper each rose by more than half a percent, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Consolidated Bonds Calm</h3>
<p>Government bonds were stable and changed little yesterday. Unified C opened at 17,000 yuan, with a high of 17,900 yuan and a low of 16,100 yuan before stabilizing. Retail investors settled. Rooms 503, 552, and Taifeng all sold, with about 6-7 million transactions. As a result, compared to the previous close, A, B, and E each fell by 400 yuan, while C and D were slightly mixed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Convenes Meeting to Discuss Grain Export</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting at the Central Bank at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the quantitative export licensing methods for soybeans, sesame, peanuts, rapeseed, and their extracted oils. Representatives from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Export Promotion Committee attended the meeting. Zhang Fuyun represented the Ministry of Finance and chaired the meeting. After discussion, it was proposed to submit a request to the authorities to designate a specialized agency to be responsible for the licensing matters. At the same time, it is necessary to investigate the current domestic production volume of the above raw materials and their extracted oils, the domestic demand, and the quantity available for export in order to determine the accurate export volume.</p>
<p>In another report, the Central Trust Bureau received a report from New York observing the world oilseed market, believing that the supply of oilseeds in the international market has been excessive recently. The United States also has a considerable production of soybeans. Furthermore, in recent months, the rate of increase in international oil prices has exceeded the general rate of increase in prices, so it is predicted that the trend of international oil futures market will weaken.</p>
<h3>Following the Price Control Committee's Resolution: Textile Construction Adjusted Yarn Prices Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fourth Month Pricing Also Decided by the Committee</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company began selling yarn yesterday according to the new negotiated prices for cotton yarn discussed and decided by the National Price Control Committee. The selling price for 20-count standard yarn is 4.6 million yuan per piece. Details of the selling prices for other counts of cotton yarn can be found in the commercial section of this newspaper below. Yesterday, in addition to selling a certain number of pieces of 32-count double-strand and 42-count double-strand cotton yarn on its own, the company also sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee as usual, selling a total of 1,697 pieces of various counts of yarn, including 1,343 pieces for domestic manufacturers and 354 pieces with yarn numbers. A total of 554 application forms were received from manufacturers, and 354 households applied for yarn numbers.</p>
<p>This reporter interviewed Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, yesterday. He had just returned to Shanghai after attending the National Price Control Committee meeting. He told the reporter that the National Price Control Committee felt that the Shanghai pricing negotiations were indecisive and not a good strategy. Therefore, based on the cost of cotton supplied by the Joint Headquarters and quota-imported cotton, plus processing fees and legitimate profits, the fourth-month negotiated price was determined to be 4.6 million yuan per piece for 20-count standard yarn. This is about 27% higher than the negotiated price of 3.7 million yuan in March. The prices of other yarn counts are determined proportionally based on cotton prices. The purchase price is the same. Regarding the current yarn and cloth issues, he listed several points to report to the National Price Control Committee: (1) Cotton Issues: The cotton shortage is a major cause of the recent yarn and cloth price increases. In the past, factories had an average of four to five months of cotton inventory, but now there is an extreme shortage. Quota-imported cotton cannot arrive in Shanghai as scheduled, and new domestic cotton will not be available until late October at the earliest, or late December to early January at the absolute earliest, which is too slow to alleviate the problem. Therefore, factories are panicked about the cotton supply and are willing to buy cotton from the market at any cost, causing cotton prices to rise higher and higher. Therefore, the first step to solve the yarn and cloth problem is to ensure that cotton is supplied to factories on time and in sufficient quantities. (2) Although the current electricity supply situation has improved, there has been no significant increase in yarn and cloth production, and China Textile Construction Company is no exception. Internally, the company's employees are treated poorly, which affects production efficiency. Externally, China Textile Construction Company loses 4 to 5 billion yuan per day by selling yarn and cloth at prices set by the government. It seems that the Price Control Committee should be asked to consider eliminating this contradictory phenomenon. (3) Regarding his views on the general situation of yarn and cloth, he believes that the current rapid rise in prices means that the cost of yarn and cloth reproduction should be considered. Therefore, the evaluation should be slightly more lenient, but the control should be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>It is reported that due to the repeated increases in yarn and cloth market prices in various regions, some members of the National Price Control Committee believe that the government is currently supplying foreign exchange for cotton purchases and is also finding ways to coordinate the purchase of domestic cotton funds. The government has invisibly grasped the supply of raw materials for yarn and cloth, so the market price of yarn and cloth should be reasonably controlled. It is generally expected that the government will issue more effective control measures in the near future. It is heard that the Shanghai private yarn factory's proposal for a unified production and sales plan for cotton yarn was considered to have considerable merit by the Price Control Committee and has been kept on file for reference.</p>
<p>Timber Slightly Recovers</p>
<p>As the market price of fir wood rose, sellers took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the market price slightly recovered. The price of foreign pine remains stable.</p>

<h3>A New Path for the Labor Movement</h3>
<p>— Ma Chaojun</p>
<p>The labor movement has been a worldwide trend since the 19th century. In this great movement, due to the different economic development situations in various countries, there are differences in the nature of the labor movement between industrialized countries and economically backward countries. In the early days, the working class in industrialized Western European countries was weak in both politics and economics. In politics, they were the ruled, and the parties representing labor occupied a very weak position in politics. In economics, they were exploited, and the fruits of economic (workers') progress were almost entirely enjoyed by the bourgeoisie. The lives of the working class were very difficult. Under these circumstances, the purpose of the labor movement in the short term was to demand increased wages and reduced working hours to improve daily life, and in the long term to implement social revolution.</p>
<p>Means of the Labor Movement</p>
<p>The means of the labor movement are, on the one hand, to organize labor groups, implement collective bargaining, and use strikes, walkouts, violence, or other similar methods when necessary to achieve their demands. On the other hand, it is to organize labor parties to implement various reforms in a bloody or bloodless manner. Later, labor groups became increasingly sound, and the power of labor could be manifested anytime and anywhere. If the Labor Party is in power, it uses political power to formulate various laws and regulations or programs related to labor to improve the political status of labor, increase labor welfare, and improve the working environment and daily life of labor. As for economically backward countries, the situation of the labor movement is completely different. Economically backward countries are still stuck in the stage of agricultural society, and the division of economic classes is not obvious. Therefore, many unreasonable labor problems caused by the "industrial" development of modern capitalist society do not yet exist in these countries. The mission and tasks of their workers are also different from those of workers in Western European countries. The nature of the labor movement is also different.</p>
<p>Economically Backward Countries</p>
<p>What path should the labor movement take in economically backward countries? First of all, we should pay attention to several characteristics of economically backward countries. First, in these countries, the exploitation and oppression suffered by the working class are far more serious than in other countries, and the labor movement is more urgently needed. Second, in these countries, industry is underdeveloped, the number of workers is small, and organization is not easy, so they are unable to resist capitalists. Therefore, the labor movement is not easy to promote. Third, these countries have lower living standards than economically developed countries due to backward production. They must concentrate all their efforts to rapidly increase and improve production in order to improve their living conditions. Fourth, these countries must have political and economic stability in order to concentrate all their efforts on production or industrialization. Fifth, according to the development of the socio-economy, these countries must implement industrialization. After industrialization, the number of workers will inevitably increase, and many labor problems in capitalist society may arise. From these five points, we know that the labor movement in economically backward countries needs to be developed urgently, but the labor movement in these countries cannot adopt methods such as strikes, walkouts, or violence to disrupt social order and reduce production like the labor movement in capitalist societies, which would make the labor movement lose its meaning. We believe that the only reasonable solution is to alleviate the economic oppression suffered by labor, assist in strengthening labor organizations, support the political status of labor, and protect the rights that labor should have, on the one hand, and persuade labor to cooperate with other classes and strive to increase production and complete the arduous task of industrialization, guaranteeing that the fruits of industrialization are reasonably distributed for the enjoyment of the laboring masses. If this path is adopted, the economic life of labor can be improved, the political status can be improved, and many labor problems can be solved accordingly. Strikes and walkouts are unnecessary actions.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Chinese Labor Movement</p>
<p>China is an economically backward country, and it also has several characteristics of general economically backward countries. Therefore, the nature of the Chinese labor movement is generally the same as that of other economically backward countries. Therefore, the labor policy of our party is based on the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, focusing on the needs of the country, on the one hand, ensuring the economic interests and political status of labor, so that the Chinese labor movement does not have to use strikes and walkouts to demand increased wages and reduced working hours, and that the Chinese labor movement does not have to use bloody or bloodless means to fight for its political status, and on the other hand, seeking to improve the work efficiency of labor to increase production, promote the prosperity of national industry, and complete the task of national construction. Therefore, the labor movement in our country should earnestly follow the labor policy of our party and strive to promote the following path.</p>
<p>Labor Organization and Democracy</p>
<p>(1) Improve the organization of labor itself and cultivate a democratic atmosphere: The purpose of labor organizations is to use collective strength to seek legitimate economic and political rights and interests. In the future, China's politics will tend to democratize, and China's economy will tend to industrialize. The importance of a sound organization for labor is becoming more and more urgent. Therefore, I hope that labor comrades will recognize the importance of their own organization and quickly participate in the legal labor union. The so-called cultivation of a democratic atmosphere refers to the fact that the organization, actions, and activities of labor should be subject to the will of the majority, respect the interests of the majority, and make the development of the labor movement on the right track, and enable the foundation of our country's democratic politics to be established.</p>
<p>Promote Labor-Capital Coordination</p>
<p>(2) Promote labor-capital coordination: In our country, because industry is underdeveloped and class concepts are not obvious, the current labor-capital problem is not a labor-capital opposition problem, but a labor-capital cooperation problem. The labor-capital disputes that have occurred in various places are mostly due to price factors and less due to class contradictions. Therefore, the labor and capital of our country should join hands to jointly devote themselves to the great cause of national construction in order to enhance each other's welfare.</p>
<p>Increase National Consciousness</p>
<p>(3) Enhance national and national consciousness: Enhancing national and national consciousness is based on the principle of reducing class consciousness and coordinating people's consciousness. We should unite and cooperate to avoid struggle, so that human and capital resources are not wasted, and concentrate all our efforts to develop national industry, so that the Three Principles of the People can be realized as soon as possible, the country can be prosperous, and the living standards of labor comrades can be improved.</p>
<p>Improve Work Rate</p>
<p>(4) Improve work efficiency, strive to increase production, so that national income can be increased. Increased income can enable industrialization to be achieved at an early date, improve the living standards of labor, smoothly implement various social systems, and improve the political status of labor. During the Anti-Japanese War, our labor comrades were able to strive to increase production, enrich the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, and achieve victory. Now we must strive to increase production to complete the arduous task of national construction.</p>
<p>Comply with Labor Discipline</p>
<p>(5) Comply with labor discipline: The establishment of labor discipline and the welfare of workers themselves, industrial development are mutually causal. If labor is undisciplined and strikes at every turn, industrial production cannot be stabilized. As a result, industry is weak, factories close, and workers lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Wage Stability and Rationality</p>
<p>(6) Strive for the stability and rationality of wages: The wages of labor must be able to maintain a minimum living standard, but if wages are too high (exceeding the level that the national economy can afford), industry will not be able to maintain itself sooner or later. As a result, the number of unemployed workers will increase, national production will decrease, and inflation will increase. If production does not increase and the currency is unstable, the actual life of workers cannot be truly improved. Therefore, wages must strive for rationality and stability.</p>
<p>Restraint on Private Capital</p>
<p>(7) Restraint on private capital and development of state capital: so that the means of production will not fall behind in the hands of a few capitalists, the power of capitalists will not expand excessively, dominate the lives of workers, and the increase in the living standards of workers can be proportional to the degree of industrialization. Since the President led the party's revolution, and the Director-General inherited his legacy, he has paid close attention to the labor movement and has been able to follow the above points. Therefore, the party's national congresses and the Central Committee have detailed plans on how to solve the economic situation of labor and support their political status. The Labor Law, the Outline of Labor Policy, and the Outline for the Implementation of the Workers' Movement have been formulated one after another to protect and improve the lives of workers, relieve unemployment, actively guide workers to organize trade unions, and support their development, enhance the strength of labor itself, and strive for all the rights and interests that labor should enjoy. During the period of one-party rule of the party, the government also followed the party's established policy for labor comrades. In the economic aspect, it actively developed industry, so that labor comrades could be fully employed and improve their economic lives. In the political aspect, it guided them to participate in politics. In the legal aspect, it stipulated that the trade unions organized by our labor were legal persons. Among the 56 delegates of the vocational circles of the National Assembly, it stipulated that the number of delegates of our farmers and workers accounted for 60%. From this, it can be seen that the political status of our labor comrades has been increased in the Constitution, and our labor comrades have the opportunity to participate in politics. At present, the government's foundation has been expanded, and the constitutional period is near. The party is still fighting for our labor comrades based on the established labor policy, but I hope that my labor comrades will, based on the spirit of self-reliance, initiative, and independence, move forward in accordance with the labor policy of the party to strive for and maintain the rights and interests of labor comrades.</p>
<p>I have been engaged in the labor movement for more than 30 years. I know the suffering of labor comrades the most, and I am most eager to solve the suffering of labor comrades. This time, I am in charge of the Central Morning Labor Department, and I will take this opportunity to work with my labor comrades to develop the labor movement in our country to seek the true interests of labor comrades.</p>
<h3>Workers' Own Festival: Talking About the Future Direction of China's Labor Movement</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingshi</p>
<p>"May 1st" Labor Day is coming again. This is a festival for workers themselves. We encounter this festival once a year. It is really unspeakable excitement and emotion. This year's Labor Day is even more worthy of our heated celebration, because our workers have done their best in this anti-aggression war, for the purpose of destroying barbaric and dark violence and fighting for freedom, progress and democracy. We finally won the victory. The biggest gain of this war is the establishment of the concept of economic democracy. We use the word "concept" here because it is still in the "conceptual stage" and has not formed a sound system. However, the trend is very obvious. People have felt that it is not enough for each person to have an election vote. Everyone must have food to eat. In other words, in addition to political democracy, there must be economic democracy.</p>
<p>In the United States, political democracy is fully developed. However, the opposition between the rich and the poor in economics is extremely obvious. The US government and all sectors of society have seen this and are trying to abandon the old capitalism and engage in the establishment of a new capitalism. They believe that the old capitalism is monopolistic and prevents others from competing, thus destroying the opportunities of the less powerful. The new capitalism wants to encourage competition and competition, not only for material things, but also for will leaders, positions and ideas, to give them opportunities to compete and make them reach reasonable standards, and at the same time to improve life.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, socialization of production plans is also being carried out on a large scale. Many transportation undertakings and heavy industries are implementing state-run and state-owned plans by the government. At the same time, the government regards the Beveridge Social Security Plan as the key to administration in order to maintain full employment and protect the basic living rights of the people. The government also wants to make efforts to ensure that anyone with the will to work, regardless of whether they can work, should have a minimum income, so that they can enjoy appropriate clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, hygiene, and the life of reproduction.</p>
<p>In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and in many countries in Europe, the post-war socio-economic system has a significant trend, which is to gradually move towards the direction of socialization. The acquisition of power by various political parties is through free and democratic methods, and at the same time, legal power is used to implement socialist improvement plans. All of this is roughly the same as our Principle of People's Livelihood in terms of ideals and practices. The Principle of People's Livelihood uses the method of "equalizing land ownership and regulating capital" to achieve bloodless economic reform. In other words, we want to appeal to reason, not to violence. The difference between the Principle of People's Livelihood and communism is: the former advocates class coordination, the latter advocates class struggle, the former implements constructive reforms, and the latter purely implements destruction and violence. However, this is contrary to the needs of our country's people and contrary to the spirit of our country and the direction of national construction.</p>
<p>The Most Blatant Destructive Force</p>
<p>The trend of the development of various regions in the world after the war is very obvious, but the efforts of governments and people of various countries have not completely overcome the economic panic, and the recession is still shrouded in every corner of the world. What is this for? First, the destruction of this war was too great, and it is not easy to recover in the short term. Second, the political and social instability of various countries has affected the progress of economic reconstruction. This phenomenon is especially profound in China.</p>
<p>The obstruction of China's reconstruction work and the destruction of the economic foundation are well-known facts. The Chinese Communist Party is the largest and most blatant destructive force. After Japan's surrender, the CCP continued to follow in the footsteps of the Japanese bandits, using all means of licentiousness, looting, robbery, and killing. At the same time, it destroyed transportation, destroyed industrial equipment, destroyed mines, and drove a large number of people to war and death. The CCP thought that this could not only drag down the government, but also create poverty, disease and famine, which could increase their "revolutionary" power.</p>
<p>Although the Communist Party's wishful thinking is like this, they did not expect that the foundation of the revolution cannot be built on the beach, and destruction alone is not necessarily revolution. Saying that the CCP's approach in China is bandit-style, there is no exaggeration of them. We have only seen the success of real revolutions in history, and we have not seen that bandits can conquer the world and consolidate it at the same time.</p>
<p>China, after eight years of hard-fought resistance, really cannot withstand any more destruction. The world has evolved to the atomic age, and whether it is our national defense industry or the general national economy, we are 108,000 miles behind. How can we survive in a world of the survival of the fittest? We should learn from the Soviet Union after the October Revolution and France after World War II, and bury our heads in hard work with the spirit of going to the national disaster. In this way, even if we cannot catch up, we will not be too far behind.</p>
<p>Labor Policy Measures</p>
<p>This is already the second Labor Day since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In this year and nine months, the government's labor policy measures and the route of labor movement development have been generally correct.</p>
<p>First of all, the government's policy of calculating wages based on the cost of living index is a wise and progressive measure. This method not only corrects the erroneous concept of "those who labor with their minds govern people, those who labor with their strength are governed by people" in China for many years, but also eliminates many unnecessary labor-capital disputes. Secondly, the government's policy of handling labor-capital disputes is also correct. As in the United States, the government uses mediation and evaluation methods to resolve labor-capital disputes, which is in line with democratic principles. In the process of mediation and evaluation, both labor and capital have representatives to participate. This can also promote labor-capital cooperation and enhance understanding between labor and capital.</p>
<p>Again, the government has also made its best efforts to support trade union organizations. At present, there are more than 7,000 industrial and vocational trade unions across the country, and most of them are very sound and pay close attention to the welfare of workers. When the constitution is implemented in the future, the relationship between trade unions and workers will be very important.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Constitution promulgated on January 1 this year also has specific provisions for the protection of labor and social security. According to the Constitution, the state must not only protect the people's right to work, but also implement social insurance, implement women and children's welfare, promote health care, and public medical systems to protect the people's lives. These are all progressive measures that are in line with the trend of the times.</p>
<p>The task of the Chinese labor movement is arduous: First, it must seek the freedom and liberation of the nation and the freedom and liberation of labor itself. Second, it must fight for human justice and world peace. This requires long-term and unyielding struggle. To achieve this task, the direction of the Chinese labor movement in the future is as follows:</p>
<p>New Directions (1) Workers must participate in politics. Various trade unions should launch outstanding workers to participate in the election of national representatives and legislators, so that workers' representatives can participate in the legislative organs, supervise the government and fight for the status and reasonable life of workers, and promote the implementation of democratic politics.</p>
<p>(2) Step up labor education. The biggest obstacle to China's democratic politics is that education is not universal enough, especially among the working class. In the future, workers must understand and ask about politics, and labor education must be strengthened. Self-education should be carried out with tools such as film, drama, music, and art, and methods such as training classes and cram schools. Each trade union should take this as its central work.</p>
<p>(3) Promote work competition, promote labor-capital cooperation, improve machine equipment, improve work efficiency, develop production, and increase social wealth. China's economy is backward, and industry is depressed. The labor community must recognize the needs of the country, grasp the key points, and strive to move forward. Society should also cultivate a culture of valuing labor, so that everyone can use their hands and brains to work hard and increase production.</p>
<p>(4) Promote the organization of the National Federation of Trade Unions. It is a pity that the labor community does not yet have a national organization. In order to promote labor unity and assist in the implementation of constitutional government, the organization of the National Federation of Trade Unions is imperative. It is hoped that the organization of the National Federation of Trade Unions will be carried out after this year's "May 1st", and it is hoped that after it is established in the future, it will not only exert great power on the contact and unity of domestic workers, but also on international labor organizations.</p>
<h3>Nation Building Through Labor</h3>
<p>— Wang Xielun</p>
<p>May 1st, is the glorious and beautiful anniversary of the world's workers. Regardless of country, race, gender, or age, all will greet this annual event with joy and excitement.</p>
<p>With labor, humanity can transition from being slaves of nature to masters of nature, from primitive to civilized, from cave dwelling and consuming raw food and blood to the atomic age. Labor is the mother of creation. We Chinese workers have built over 5,000 years of splendid culture with drops of sweat. Through our labor, we have conquered fierce birds and beasts, wind, thunder, water, and fire, slave owners, feudal lords, tyrannical monarchs, brutal warlords, and domineering imperialists, defeating countless historical criminals.</p>
<p>One share of labor, one share of harvest. Give one share of heat, emit one share of light. Freedom and happiness are not something that can be achieved overnight. Regardless of how the bloodthirsty scum within the country, who are prone to causing chaos, purely for their own and their party's interests, are destroying transportation, hindering construction, devastating the vitality of the nation, and ruining the nation's lifeline; regardless of how international neo-imperialists, arms dealers, warmongers, and financial speculators, purely for the vested and coveted interests of a few groups, are clamoring wildly, creating an atmosphere of killing and desperately launching and deploying a new world war; we know how to clearly recognize the country's and our own precise needs, we know how to temper ourselves in suffering, we know how to strengthen our will, we know what kind of path the creators and leaders of the Republic of China have shown us we should take.</p>
<p>We are honored that, on the soil of the Republic of China, especially in the recent half-century, so many brilliant and outstanding revolutionary movements and leaders of worker movements have emerged. They led us to fight against the Manchu Qing government, led us to fight against the Northern Warlords, and led us to fight against Japanese imperialists, and all achieved excellent results. Today, the constitution has been formulated, and the joint government has been established. Although there are thorns and obstacles on the road to a new China of democracy, freedom, prosperity, strength, and happiness, we have taken the first step of rebirth in these dark and turbulent times. Walking is always better than not walking, and doing is always better than not doing.</p>
<p>However, having said that, the actual work of nation-building is not as easy as empty talk. Industry is the backbone of a modern country, and workers are the real supporters of a modern country! We must not underestimate labor, let alone belittle ourselves. In peacetime, what aspect of clothing, food, housing, and transportation can do without workers? In wartime, what aspect of offense and defense, advance and retreat, can do without workers? On this riddled and troubled land of China, to build a modern nation of, by, and for the people, our work is urgently needed. In the current situation of chaos and fragmentation, with everything waiting to be rebuilt, we workers should build the nation with a pioneering spirit. Let us add a unique brilliance to the construction of the new China with our labor. (Shanghai, on the eve of the Labor Day in the thirty-sixth year)</p>
<h3>New Topics on Labor Movement on May 1st: Focus on Work, Supplemented by People</h3>
<p>— Lu Keming</p>
<p>This year's commemoration of May 1st coincides with the time when our party (Kuomintang) is ending political tutelage and implementing the return of power to the people. Therefore, the new task entrusted to the labor movement by the times is: "How to guide the labor masses to correctly use their rights and powers." This is definitely not something that can be achieved through empty theories or passive discipline. We should inspire the labor masses to recognize their importance and cherish their interests. In other words, we want the labor masses to respect and value themselves. The strategy of "cadres decide everything" is no longer applicable today! Using cadres to lead the grassroots had more advantages than disadvantages during the period of political tutelage, but after the implementation of constitutionalism, it will have more disadvantages than advantages! Because the top-down leadership method often means that senior cadres only contact a part of the middle-level cadres, and the middle-level cadres maintain contact with the lower-level cadres. The broad labor masses are separated from the core organization by levels, forming, at best, an idolatrous blind worship of the overall movement policy and leaders, or only an indirect understanding. If the cadres are not sound, the labor masses' confidence in the entire policy will be shaken, and even doubts will arise. This system that relies on people is very dangerous. Therefore, today we should focus on work and supplement it with people in our labor movement. We should not create things because of people, but use people for the sake of things. In short, leadership should not be decided by a few cadres, but should consolidate the organization on the basis of welfare undertakings. What is especially important is to inspire laborers to participate and design automatically. The cadres responsible for leading laborers can no longer stubbornly maintain a high-handed and commanding style. They must replace it with a spirit of serving laborers, serving on the one hand and leading on the other, advancing on both sides, so that the labor masses feel that they are not being led, but experience the greatness of service enthusiasm. In the opportunity of service, patiently guide them to the broad road of self-motivation. This is an urgent innovation, and I would like to encourage all labor movement leaders together.</p>

<h3>Guidance on Selecting and Studying in University Departments</h3>
<p>— Wu Daquan</p>
<p>Written by Du Zuozhou, etc., published by China Cultural Service Society</p>
<p>When young students enter university, which courses should they choose to study? Regarding this question, I think everyone can feel its importance. Many young people who have stepped out of the school gate and entered society often feel that "what they have learned is not useful" due to the difficulty of finding employment. Of course, the ultimate reason is that the various departments of social construction in our country are still unable to develop evenly, and at the same time, the personnel system is not yet on the right track. However, the selection of courses in school at the beginning is indeed the biggest cause.</p>
<p>"Guidance on Selecting and Studying in University Departments" helps students solve this difficult problem. Of course, it cannot be said that it already includes all university courses, but in the twenty-three articles in the book, it already includes thirteen different department courses. Almost every article is equivalent to an introduction to a subject. For a student who has not received proper guidance on methods of advancing to higher education, this is undoubtedly an excellent teacher and companion. It clearly analyzes and introduces the inside workings of each department and the preparations for admission, and then lets you assess your abilities, interests, aspirations, and future career prospects before selecting a subject.</p>
<p>Correcting students' concepts of any department is also deeply instructed in this book. For example, studying politics, because politics is not a practical science, and the path for studying politics is to become an official. It seems despicable to take becoming an official as the goal, which causes some young people to be unwilling to study it, but the author clearly points out "...if the most conscious and revolutionary young people now regard politics as a daunting task and are unwilling to study politics and engage in politics, and a group of unconscious and corrupt elements are appointed to political work, how can we expect progress in our country's politics?..." (See page 108) Another example is studying education. Some people may think that education is a hard work, and for personal gain, studying education is not suitable. But the author says: "...; Education is indeed hard, but there is joy in hardship. To appreciate the benefits, you must delve into it and devote yourself to it for life." (See page 72) From these two paragraphs, we are told that we must face the value of each course squarely. As long as you have achievements in your studies, the so-called "every profession produces an expert," each has its own way out. The question is whether you can work hard academically.</p>
<p>How to work hard in your studies after selecting a course is also something that every student should pay attention to. Many people often enter a department, study for a while, feel that it is difficult or boring, and then change to another course. Such a change of course will not only fail to achieve your goal, but will often lead to nothing. As the author says, "For a kind of learning, if you can persevere, your interest will gradually increase. As the saying goes, 'When skill is achieved through practice, pleasure naturally arises.'" Such encouragement and enlightenment, in addition to guiding us in selecting department courses, will also be of greater help in the progress of our studies.</p>
<p>"Studying blindly without interest is unfavorable to the country and the individual." Whether young people can develop and achieve success is related to the future destiny of the country. "Guidance on Selecting and Studying in University Departments" points out a clear path for us. "If this problem can be properly solved, not only can individual talents develop smoothly and concentrate on deepening their studies; the success of one's life career and the happiness of life will also be established here. At the same time, society and the country will also benefit from the healthy development of individuals, meet their needs, prosper their construction, and benefit from it."</p>
<h3>Maugham on His Recent Works</h3>
<p>— Translated by Cai Xue</p>
<p>Somerset Maugham, a British writer who has been writing for fifty years and is now seventy-two years old, still looks so healthy, agile, and respectable. He says what he wants to say, and what he says is not necessarily what people want to hear. Unlike other celebrities, he doesn't feel he has any mystery; he has no "airs." His voice tells people that he is intelligent and kind; his eyes let us know that he still has some illusions about himself and others. In a crowded room, you may not have seen him, but he has already noticed you.</p>
<p>During the last war, he worked in intelligence and wrote the novel about a spy, "Ashenden." This time he is in the United States dedicated to improving Anglo-American relations. He also wrote a novel called "The Razor's Edge," which sold three million copies. Americans respect such an "ambassador." Someone asked him if the book sold so well because of its religious motivation. "Yes," he said, "From the letters I received, I am very sure of this; Americans are now dissatisfied with their philosophy of life. Power, money, and success have not brought them the results they hoped for."</p>
<p>He also said: "I plan to write two more books; a final collection of short stories, a novel about Spain during the time of Philip III—not historical—after which I will 'retire' and select and publish my notes, which I have been taking since I was eighteen."</p>
<p>Maugham went to the East after the last war, where he found the most perfect material. Apart from "The Painted Veil," Maugham showed the essence of his being a writer in these Eastern stories.</p>
<p>When asked how young writers should live, Maugham said, "Only two kinds of writers can live off their books—novelists and short story writers. No poet has ever done that."</p>
<p>He donated a sum of money to the Writers' Association to set up several travel grants. Those who receive this grant (four hundred pounds) should try to stay away as long as possible, with no other conditions.</p>
<p>What does Maugham think of the West? He said, "I am optimistic about the future; I don't believe there will be another war. I think Russia is now exhausted and somewhat fearful. We must find a way to reduce his fear. But what I fear is the United States. Now there are generals in the United States who think that Russia must be defeated while it is still weak; and there are businessmen who want to rule the world. The United States is somewhat anxious and neurotic. When people are nervous, they are prone to making mistakes."</p>
<p>Maugham does not intend to stay in the United States forever, although he likes Americans quite a bit. He misses Europe and plans to spend his remaining years in Cap Ferrat, France (where he has a villa). (This article is taken from Post)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Japanese Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Yu Shouzhong</p>
<p>In 1946, the Japanese publishing industry published a total of 2,702 first editions and 1,125 reprints, excluding magazines.</p>
<p>Based on this calculation, Japan published an average of more than ten kinds of books and magazines every day last year. But since this year, this number has increased again. Currently, Japan has an average of more than twenty kinds of books, including first editions and reprints, transported from printing houses to bookstores for sale every day.</p>
<p>In terms of content, new books are mostly in the category of literature and art. Among literary and artistic books, detective novels and popular novels are more common. Secondly, there are also many "complete works." From soft writers Riki Yumoto Okamoto, Mantaro Kubota, and Soseki Natsume to hard writers Kiyoshi Miki, Ikuo Oyama, and Minzo Kushida, the complete works have been published successively. In addition, complete works of European writers such as Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gide, and Valéry have also been published one after another.</p>
<p>In addition to literary and artistic books, there are also quite a few children's books, but most of them are reprints, and whether they are appropriate for modern children's psychology is questionable. The content of some children's magazines is even more outdated.</p>
<p>In terms of social sciences, socialist books have gradually decreased after the Yoshida Cabinet came to power. What has replaced them are more moderate books. However, books such as Masao Takahashi's "Words of Socialism", Masakazu Ibe's "History of the Development of Socialism", and Kenzo Kiga's "Theory of Modern Socialist Thought" are still popular.</p>
<p>Of course, books on democratic issues are popular for a while. However, the content is nothing special. At best, it has only changed from focusing on "quantity" in the past to focusing more on "quality" now. Among these books, Masanori Oshima's "Basic Concepts of Democracy" and Masamichi Shinmei's "Introduction to Democracy" have more readers.</p>
<p>Books on current affairs are very rare. Anti-Soviet things have a tendency to gradually rise. Books on reviewing the war are almost extinct.</p>
<p>After Japan's surrender, people from all walks of life often talked about why they were defeated. Most attributed it to the fact that science, technology, resources, and population were inferior to others. Few talked about the aggressive nature of this war and the responsibility that should be borne. The publishing industry is no exception. Recently, due to the evolution of the international situation and the gradual recovery of Japanese production, the past reflections on the war have long been forgotten. What is being discussed has become how to make Japan a strong country through the next war. The future trends of the Japanese publishing industry seem unlikely to deviate too far from this topic.</p>
<h3>Chinese Geography Textbook Map</h3>
<p>— Lu Caihe, Sun Panshou</p>
<p>This atlas was compiled by Mr. Jin Qingyu of the "Chinese Historical and Geographical Atlas Compilation Society" and was revised and republished in December last year. When flipping through this atlas, the first impression is that the drawings are very detailed and aesthetically pleasing. There are a total of forty-six maps, with provincial maps accounting for thirty-one of them. The others are general maps of astronomy, the world, terrain, administrative divisions, river systems, climate, soil, population density, industry, transportation, and national defense. In front of these maps, there is a national three-dimensional terrain map rendered in natural colors, allowing readers to recognize the true appearance of our country's territory, which is a major feature of this map. The terrain map at the back is perfect in terms of accuracy and color. It is very interesting to study them in comparison with the three-dimensional map. The national river system map lists all the important rivers in the country without omission, and the division of their basins is also very reasonable. However, the term "river system flow machine" listed in the legend could be changed to "slope washing area," which would have a clearer meaning.</p>
<p>The population density map is very clear. As for the two industry maps, it is best to differentiate the various symbols by size according to their importance. For example, the Chengdu Plain produces rice, and the Hexi Corridor also produces rice, but the output of the two differs greatly. Therefore, the "rice" character printed on the Chengdu Plain may be larger, and the one printed on the Hexi Corridor may be smaller. This way, the person reading the map will naturally know where a certain industry is important and where it is secondary.</p>
<p>The content of the transportation map is very detailed. The distances between the main ports are explained separately in the lower left corner of the map, which has reference value. However, both highway lines and air routes are indicated in red, which easily confuses the perception of the person reading the map. It is better to use two colors. The air routes can be drawn thinner. If the navigable sections of waterway transportation can be indicated with symbols, readers can understand them at a glance, saving a lot of effort in flipping through newspapers and magazines. If you feel that a map contains too much material and the map is too messy and complex, you may wish to omit the provincial boundaries, otherwise draw two separate maps, because transportation is an important part of geography.</p>
<p>It is best to indicate important cities with red dots of different sizes according to the population level, so that it is more clear. Shanghai is our country's economic center, and Nanjing is our country's political center. It is very meaningful to combine them into a single map in this atlas. The astronomy map and the world map seem unnecessary to be inserted into this atlas, because this inevitably repeats the materials of the world geography atlas.</p>
<p>The provincial maps at the back, except for the nine northeastern provinces and the two provinces of Suiyuan and Ningxia, which are combined into one map due to the intricate regions, the rest are one province per map. Although the scale of each map cannot be unified, which affects the reader's sense of area size, this configuration method is indeed more in line with reality in today's China, where the concept of provincial divisions is very strong. The maps of each province are very detailed. The main and branch lines of the highway are indicated by thick and thin lines, and the reader can see the difference in importance at a glance. It is just that there are too many place names listed on each map. The maps of provinces such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hebei, and Shandong are densely occupied by place names, and it is very laborious for the person reading the map. Because this atlas is a textbook map, most of the names cannot be mentioned, and if unimportant place names are written less, the map will be simpler and the reader's perception will be clearer. The editors must have been afraid that everyone would not be able to find the place names, so they inadvertently sought details instead of simplicity. We can infer this good intention.</p>
<p>The explanations in this atlas are extremely concise, and no nonsense can be found in them. In the explanations of the general map section, it is best to explain in detail the topographic overview, climatic characteristics, population distribution, industrial situation, and urban formation.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned opinions, whether right or wrong, our main purpose is to arouse discussion among the editorial authorities and interested people.</p>
<h3>"Introduction to Literary Theory"</h3>
<p>— Huran</p>
<p>Written by Cai Yi, published by Cultural Life Publishing House</p>
<p>The book "Introduction to Literature" includes several questions on the nature of literature, namely: (1) What is literature? (2) Why is literature? (3) How does literature arise and develop? In this booklet, the author has made in-depth analyses and explanations of these three questions. We will now briefly describe his central ideas below to provide readers who love literature with a reference:</p>
<p>(1) What is literature? Literature is what gives us impressions of things, arouses our emotions, and can increase our knowledge—that is to say: when we are reading a novel, the characters described in the book, their appearance, attitude, words, and actions, always appear in our minds. When he falls into some unfortunate encounter, you are angry and sad for him; when he is struggling, you will be excited and worried for him; and it is the background depicted in the novel that allows us to clearly recognize how dark and complex the circle we live in is; we should have what kind of vigilance in our after-reading meditation.</p>
<p>Literature is to describe the things of the objective real world, the people and events of society, and never to narrate the empty theory of images; it not only tells us about the birds, beasts, grass, and trees of natural things, but also allows us to have a knowledge of things, because we can understand the social and historical movement of the production of a certain thing; a novel may express much historical knowledge that many history books cannot express in detail, and a short poem can express great truths that a long paper cannot express—literature can increase our knowledge, so that we can obtain a holistic understanding of the environment in which the thing itself exists.</p>
<p>(2) Why is literature? Literary works are not exclusively a tool to publicize an idea or promote a lesson; nor are they a form of entertainment for people to pass the time; strictly speaking, they are a tool to organize society; if a person wants to live with other people, they must have a way to transmit and receive thoughts and emotions, so that human beings can help each other and contact each other to live a social life; literary works are this best medium of transmission; because they can express things more concretely and completely, and at the same time their readership is also larger; they not only reflect objective things, but also show the development of society; therefore, a true literary worker, the social consciousness he expresses, must be forward-looking, correct, and full of revolutionary spirit.</p>
<p>(3) How does literature arise and develop? Literature is a relatively refined product, a crystallization of human evolution to a considerable stage; its occurrence and development are determined by the social foundation. The origin of literature is not only due to the development of human religious emotions, but also due to labor; the sound of "Hang Yu" from the mouths of coolies is thought by some to be the origin of literature; the songs of savage peoples in the hunting era are the prototype of poetry; so we list poetry as the earliest literature; at that time, poetry was inseparable from music and dance; after narrative poetry and lyric poetry were differentiated; narrative poetry that could be sung and performed by two or more people was the beginning of opera; and narrative poetry sung by one person was the beginning of ballad singing; when opera reached the eve of capitalism, it developed into spoken drama, and ballad singing and the like developed into modern novels; this is the general situation of the occurrence and development of the various forms of literature today.</p>
<p>Literature follows the development of social history; it can be divided into the following four classes:</p>
<p>(1) Literature of slave society—the literary content of this era, in addition to being related to religion, partly reflects the life of slave owners, and very little reflects the life of slaves. The content is dominated by praising the compassion of gods; and pays attention to form, so "poetry" became the best form at that time. Those theoretical articles that cannot be expressed in poetry use the form of fu, and the sentences of Lao Tzu's I Ching are rhyming—this is the characteristic of the literature at that time. (2) Literature of feudal society—at the end of slave society, the personality and creativity of free people could be brought into play, so from the Han to the Sui Dynasties, my country's literary achievements were remarkable (at this time, Western Europe was in a period of literary decline), and the poems and lyrics of the Tang and Song Dynasties had developed to the most brilliant stage, but most of those authors were from the ruling class, so they only sympathized with the oppressed serfs. After the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, novels and plays gradually developed, their expression was relatively strong, and they were easily welcomed by readers, and the content often exposed the incompetence and crimes of feudal landlords, "Dream of the Red Chamber", "Water Margin", "Officialdom Exposed" and so on, are real examples. (3) Social literature of capitalism—after the rise of capitalism, human beings struggled to break free from old shackles and sought the development of personality. They took equality and freedom as their central ideas, so the achievements in literature were relatively outstanding. The purpose of the New Literature Movement was precisely to oppose all feudal shackles. (4) Literature of the new century—the century of the people, needs freedom in politics and economy. At this time, the people's artistic requirements have been reflected in literature, becoming the people's literature; and it is also slightly different in nature from the past; first, it is the people who are the protagonists, second, it is to grasp objective things from the people's point of view; third, it is to express it in the language of the people; Gorky and other great writers' creations have these factors; therefore, the future of literature is not only related to the efforts of literary writers, but also matches the growth of people's power and the progress of society.</p>
<p>"Introduction to Literary Theory" is a purely theoretical small book. The author allows us to understand some of the main points of the essence of literature in a very short time in the simplest way. We now use a small number of words to introduce the main ideas, just to hope that readers can have a more kind of understanding of several basic questions about literature.</p>
<p>In addition to being clear in explaining the theory, this book has no other obvious features. At the same time, the author did not list the bibliography at the end of the book, which is very inconvenient for readers who want to delve into this issue.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Laboring Society – Written for May First Labor Day</h3>
<p>— Ge Yi</p>
<p>Our society, all of its civilization and education, is the product of human labor. Whether it be mental or physical labor, our goal is to acquire more living resources for humanity and to seek more joy and happiness. In the past, during primitive times, human labor advanced toward this goal, and in the present atomic age, human labor is still the same, and it will not change in the future.</p>
<p>Logically, with society having evolved to the 20th century, and with the fruits accumulated from our human labor, today we should all certainly have enough happiness in life, and at the very least, there should definitely not be anyone suffering from hunger or cold. However, in reality, we know that most of the people today are living difficult lives under the torment of survival, and countless people die young due to the lack of food and clothing.</p>
<p>Clearly, although human society has evolved, an unreasonable social system that devalues people has also emerged along with it. Let us not mention anything else; why is it that some people exhaust their mental and physical strength to labor, but in the end, there is nowhere for them to use it? Why is it that the income of laborers cannot even support themselves and their children? On the contrary, those who do not labor can enjoy a comfortable life, even extending to their sons and relatives? It is also very obvious that these people are plundering the fruits of the laborers. Laborers have completely become the private property of capitalists—like cattle, horses, or machines.</p>
<p>However, although our society has unfortunately experienced the so-called era of capitalism, people have eventually realized that this system is a shackle on human progress, a wretched fate of slavery. After the wheels of time have rolled over that difficult track, no one is willing to return to that painful path. Now, even though our future is still rough, the torch of democracy has already illuminated our eyes.</p>
<p>Everyone should have reasonable work, this work is for oneself and for society; all those who labor should have adequate living resources, whatever they need, they should have. The work of society is divided, but division of labor does not mean creating human classes; in creating a more civilized life, everyone is a hero. Moreover, mental labor and physical labor are integrated with each other.</p>
<p>Everyone has books to read, jobs to do, and all the sustenance and needs. We must strive towards this direction, and the meaning of today's Labor Day lies here.</p>
<h3>Chinese Studies</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>A question in the test published in the Ta Kung Pao regarding whether Japan will invade China has caused me to feel quite melancholy after reading it.</p>
<p>Before surrendering, Japan had specialized organizations studying China, such as the South Manchuria Railway Research Department, the East Asia Economic Research Bureau, and the East Asia Research Institute. These organizations were dissolved and eliminated following Japan's surrender; however, many newly emerging organizations have been established to conduct comprehensive investigations and research on Chinese issues, such as the "China Research Institute" established in January last year, which has as many as eighty-eight scholars and experts familiar with the Chinese situation.</p>
<p>Currently, there are various publications on Chinese studies, such as *Chinese Literature* (Shenghuo Publishing House), *New China* (Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha), *Chinese Review* (edited by the China Research Institute and published by Nihon Hyoron Sha), *Monthly China* (Kodo Sha), and *New China* (Teikoku Shoin). On the other hand, how many specialized publications do we have studying Japan? It can be said that, apart from sporadic articles published in newspapers, there are almost none.</p>
<p>Needless to say, their purpose in studying China is to grasp the reality of modern China, study China's international relations, and critique Japan's past policies towards China in order to establish a new relationship between China and Japan. (The above is part of the business outline of the China Research Institute.) They feel that the Chinese problem has a great impact on them, directly and indirectly. In reality, Japan's every move has an even greater impact on us.</p>
<p>Their style is still to create a "Japanese industrial nation," and with MacArthur's support, they are gradually moving towards this path. But what about us? We are still in turmoil, and "Japanese studies" is even more out of the question.</p>
<h3>A She-Devil, Not a Demon</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou</p>
<p>I saw the news about the she-devil in the newspaper and saw her picture. This "demon" neither has three heads and six arms, nor a blue face and fangs, and doesn't look monstrous at all: she looks like what Shanghai people call a mistress from a "white collar" family, without any demonic aura.</p>
<p>Looking at her behavior; first, she dresses as a man. Dressing as a man doesn't necessarily make one a demon. What kind of clothes should a woman wear anyway? You can't say, and I can't say either. Ancient Han Chinese clothing? Western women's attire? Or a fire-colored coat, a short jacket on top, long trousers on the bottom, and a Manchu qipao in the middle?</p>
<p>Second, she seduces good women. If this also counts as something only demons do, then there are too many she-devils in our society. The tools for seducing good women vary, among which the most important are money, power, status, beauty, intelligence, eloquence, and so on. This woman only used a set of men's clothing, without any magic involved.</p>
<p>Third, she commits indecent acts against the seduced women. Speaking of this, we can't help but think of many gentlemen and ladies, celebrities and socialites in society, it's better not to talk about it. In short, this woman and these people are not enough to be considered demons.</p>
<p>Fourth, she induces addiction to smoking, which has even less to do with demons. Fifth, she instigates discord between husbands and wives. There are many divorces in this era, and it is not said that there are demons causing trouble in them.</p>
<p>Sixth, she defrauds people of money. If this old woman did not defraud people of money but only engaged in the first five things, then although she is not a demon, she must be called a freak. Now, just as the Western saying goes, all roads lead to Rome, she is no different from you, me, and him, busy and bustling, all for the sake of profit. What demon is there in this? What freak is there in this? It is truly too mundane, too much like the so-called "popularization."</p>
<p>Since the she-devil is not a demon, the story about the she-devil has a bit of a demonic air. The news report said that among the victims of the she-devil are many concubines, and one of them is said to be the concubine of a certain wealthy merchant. The wealthy merchant and the concubine are naturally not demons either, but there is always something strange about their relationship. It is from this strangeness that the story of the she-devil arises.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of the "Counter Lions"</h3>
<p>— Li Quan</p>
<p>I have been involved in labor movement activities for less than a year. I have become aware of many obstacles to the labor movement, which have given me the impression of being thorny and distressing, empty and sad. What is discussed here is the labor movement of old-fashioned shops, not involving the scope of industrial workers.</p>
<p>Logically, in this democratic era, all actions and words of the people that are in accordance with the proper path should not be subject to any restrictions. Moreover, labor movement organizations are a link in the national "use of the people" organization, and should of course be fully guaranteed. However, because this is the beginning of democracy, and all laws related to the labor movement have not yet undergone a complete transformation; therefore, those engaged in the labor movement still feel endless distress at any time; the workers' hearts are also still filled with endless sadness.</p>
<p>Look, this is the common situation of shop workers, working sixteen hours a day, getting up at six in the morning and not going to bed until after ten at night; they are like birds closed in a cage, silently doing shop duties in the store all day long, not getting any right to entertainment, especially under the apprenticeship system, constantly destroying lively children. Low wages, hard life, serving like this until death, I don't know how much resentment is buried underground, but they have never received sympathy from the outside world. How pitiful are this group of people called "counter lions"? Can they still engage in labor movement activities? Can they still enjoy labor movement rights?</p>
<p>If someone is elected as a director or supervisor of the labor union, then he must be sensible and manage less labor union affairs; otherwise, his job will be in trouble. Although, the dismissal of a labor union director or supervisor by the capital side in the serving store must be submitted to the authorities for approval, but where there is a desire to condemn, there is no lack of excuses—paying him a few months of dismissal salary, what else can be said?</p>
<p>A labor union clerk who runs out to solicit members can see everywhere; it is the old man or manager with a sullen face, squinting his eyes, glaring at the employees; this situation, even in the hot weather in June, will make people feel chills. Of course, he can also make the employees remain silent, not daring to join the labor union. Therefore, most of the employees hope that the labor union can forcibly make them join the union. But who has ever heard of using the current "People's Organizations Compulsory Membership Measures"? This is not the laziness of the labor union clerk, it is that the "measures" cannot be applied to reality! (Above)</p>
<h3>Not Murder</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Man A: I want to shoot and kill the person who married my wife.</p>
<p>Man B: You can't do that, that's committing murder, isn't it?</p>
<p>Man A: No, it's just suicide.</p>
<h3>American Car Stores</h3>
<p>— Ying Dong</p>
<p>Every Sunday morning, the streets of American towns are filled with the sound of horns. White trucks crawl on the roads, stopping every fifty or sixty yards. Most of them are children and women, loaded with groceries, vegetables, and household goods. These newly designed stores are mostly converted from wartime vehicles, driven by veterans. They put grocery stores on cars, symbolizing the vitality of American small businesses.</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Circles</h3>
<p>Our Hong Kong-based reporter Lin Youlan, after translating "The Bell of Adano," recently submitted the translation of the new book "Arch of Triumph" by the famous German writer Remarque to "Banana Publishing House" for publication. The book has been shipped to this city for sale. Banana Publishing House is the only publishing center in South China composed of cultural figures who returned from the rear areas of Yu and Kun after the war, and there are currently many new books in the process of being printed.</p>
<p>The novelist Ai Wu is still living in the Chongqing orphanage. He recently wrote to a friend in Shanghai saying: "Four children are all suffering from measles, writing has been suspended for nearly a month." (Jing Cheng)</p>
<p>SY (Liu Shengya) is currently engaged in translating Soviet novels. Some of them are old Russian novels that have not yet been translated by Chinese people. Mr. Liu is currently translating from German texts. (Jing Cheng)</p>
<p>Mao Dun brought back a large number of paintings and photographs from the Soviet Union. There are also many Soviet publications. In addition, he brought back many Soviet chocolate candies, which taste very good. (Jiu)</p>
<p>Many writers and editors went to Hangzhou for sightseeing this spring, but the Hangzhou plan of the Literary and Art Association has been cancelled, reportedly because too few people participated. (Qing)</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"However, she is already Mrs. Hu!" someone objected.</p>
<p>"What does marriage matter?" Xiao Zhang immediately retorted. "Didn't you see her helping us rush to paint the scenery a few days ago?"</p>
<p>"I think that Fei Fei is also very cute!" Lu Qian also joined their conversation. "Yesterday, she went out with us to perform 'Put Down Your Whip,' and many people were moved to tears. It's a pity that the problem of them leaving has not been resolved until now. Alas! This world is fundamentally unreasonable!"</p>
<p>In fact, the evacuation problem of Lan and Fei Fei has other twists and turns, not simply because there is no car. Dai Shaoming recently received a telegram from Hu Juewen from Chongqing, asking him to be sure to find a way to bring his wife and children back, and promising to pay for the travel expenses; while Old Xu's wife had another idea, because she is a woman who loves vanity and loves to show off the most, using humiliating others and exalting herself as a kind of life pleasure. She is very jealous of Guan's rich knowledge—of course, she will never admire her beauty—and hates her upright and unyielding personality that does not easily bow her head to others. She has even seen through some of the past friendship between Lan and Zhu Zhaonian; thus, a strong desire arose in her heart to take advantage of their current environment where they have to ask Xu Fatty for help, to forcibly subdue this knowledgeable and ambitious enemy, so that she can vent her commanding habits more happily, and in the future, she can say to acquaintances with a dismissive expression:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hu? What's she! She wouldn't dare to speak to me!"</p>
<p>Therefore, she instead encouraged Xu Shaoming to take their mother and daughter away.</p>
<p>However, Lan, who loves art, also has a smarter mind than that Mrs. Ni. She had already seen through the personalities of Xu Shaoming and his wife. In any case, she did not want to let herself and her beloved daughter fall into their trap, to be controlled by them, to be bullied by them. She declined their invitation very happily, preferring to find other ways. Zhu Zhaonian also respected her wishes. From the day Xiao Rong left with Jin Ai, he moved out of the small school dormitory in Dongting and lived with Lu Qian and Zhang Chang in the art museum, so as not to be slanderously criticized by the eloquent Mrs. Xu.
