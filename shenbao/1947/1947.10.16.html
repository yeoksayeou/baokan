<h3>魏使報吿延不發表華府人士揣測紛紜　對援華步驟有詳盡建議</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十四日電〕魏德邁將車之對華報吿，仍爲此間一外交神秘。月前魏氏即向杜魯門總統及馬卿提出正式報吿，但迄今內容未詳。此聞甚多人士逐漸認淸，該報吿恐將永不公布。據未證實之謠傳謂，侵該報吿擱置不發表者，厥爲馬卿。至於擱置之原因，則無人敢加以臆測。某觀察家認爲魏德邁曾建議以物資及財力與技術援助之詳細步驟，北美報紙聯盟之華府記者艾倫，本日於論文中稱，魏德邁將軍之報吿，已散發七份。獲得此項報吿者，計有杜魯門總統，代理國務鄉浴維特，國務卿馬歇爾，及財務部，海陸軍兩部。艾倫謂，此篇幅甚長之報吿，載有關於中國及中國如何適合其國際地位之詳細建議，然並未詳述中國政府之缺點。該報吿之主要部份，乃對中國經濟，政治，軍事及社會情形之分析，其中一項建議，即謂美國再予中國以援助，則此項援助應受美國之監督，包括實際之分配工作。艾倫並謂，中國政府洞悉魏氏報吿之內容。另據某消息靈通官員謂，對此報吿所以保持緘默之原因，可能有三：　該報吿涉及甚多政府機關，此必須待多日後方能加以考慮，並採取行動。　該報吿之强調全球性援助計劃，使國務院不能協調，蓋國務院刻正竭力設法使馬歇爾援歐計劃，能趨實現。　杜魯門政府恐對華援助倘於此時成爲一般公共討論之議題，則可能對馬歇爾計劃有不利影響。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯說老實話　追述雅爾達協定之失策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕前國務卿貝爾納斯在其「說老實話」回憶錄中宣布，當蘇聯履行條件參加對日作戰之際，如蘇聯作相反之決定而不參加，則渠將引以為快。「雖日本堅持不肯無條件投降，余當時相信原子彈可以成功，而逼令日本屈膝。紅軍進入東北時，余為前途戚戚而慮。在其撤退前，余之　憂竟成事實。」貝氏稱，雅爾達會議美國取得蘇聯之允諾時，軍事局勢全然與碌聯參戰時不同。羅斯福總統及其軍事領袖當時渴望蘇聯加入戰爭，無人能遠見矚知雅爾達會繼後，所遭遇之因難。貝氏稱，起草日本和約不致十分因難，惟賠償問題將為一大問題。蓋蘇聯堅稱紅軍自東北搬走之工業設備，應認為戰利品，而不列入賠償品中。</p>

<p>中央研究院於昨日召開評議會於首都：此次會譏之召開，其主要任務，據報傳消息，爲審核院士候選人，以便明年提出選舉後，完成全部研究體系。會中聞翁文灝胡先　諸氏，先後發表意見，呼籲社會政府重視科學。對於此一全國最高學術研究機關的評議會之召開，値此戡亂建國的時候，我們不能無一言。</p>
<p>中央研究院是全國最高的學術研究機關；旣然稱爲研究，一句俗話來說，自然是鑽的牛角尖。對於這種專門的研究，我們應該提倡，以便迎頭趕上人家。但我們認爲也應該有加以補充的必要。</p>
<p>第一，中央研究院究竟不是私人的或私立的研究機關，而是動用着國庫，直隸國民政府的國立研究機關，旣然如此，一切的研究計劃，應該基於國家民族的立塲，配合當前的國策，不能僅聽一己或私人的偏好。蘇聯的國立機關是如此，卽在英美，以國庫來維持的研究機關也大抵如此。中央研究院雖不是一個完全基於國防的需要而設立的研究機關，但它所計劃的並正在進行着的硏究，總應該配合着國策。</p>
<p>第二，專門硏究固然很重要；但專門學術的通俗化，在目前的中國，其重要或亦不亞於專門研究。到現在，國內若干大學的教材，還得選用西文原著，這充分表明了中國學術的尙未成年，根本還談不到獨立；甚至在中國的史學哲學方面，情形亦復不免如此，聞共匪所設立的僞中央研究院有基於所謂馬列主義的中國通史之編印，爲什麼中華民國的中央研究院不能依據憲法，有基於三民主義的中國通史之纂輯？中央研究院的歷史語言研究所，自成立以來，在專門研究方面，確已極有供獻，但在學術的通俗化方面，特別是在如何配合我們的國策方面，似猶嫌未足。至於一般科學方面的研究，亦應針對中國最急切的需要而進行，方不負國家及人民對於中央研究院的期望，那又更不待言。</p>
<p>講到中央研究院院士的選舉，此在中國，尙爲創舉。院士云云，似本於英國皇家學會會員及法國「阿卡特美」的制度。在法英兩國，此兩機關的會員，均享有崇高的聲譽。英國人在他的名字、背後，加上了F.R.S.三個字的縮寫，就彷彿增添了無上的光榮。然而這是外國的一種制度，它們在外國已生了根，埋在它們的泥土裏，而成為他們的文化中遺產之一部。我們將這種制度移殖過來，我們也須將它深入我們的泥土，使它也成爲所以對於院土的選舉，我們就應該格外審慎；務期膺選之土，能够使人不致有濫芋充數之感</p>
<p>至於講到呼顩政府社會重視科學一點，我們認爲政府社會固應重視科學，而從事於科學的人尤應知所自重；必自重而後人能重視。今天我們有多少忠誠於科學的人，忍受着一切困難磨折而不離他們的本位，這種精神是値得舉國一致贊佩的！然而也有多少研究科學或受過科學洗禮的人，竟也離開了他們的本位，而從事於共它足以使他們增加權力和財富的行當，他們拋棄了科學，離開了他們固有的崗位，這在國家固然是大損失，在他們自身也未嘗不感痛苦。中國的科學家如能從士大夫的傳統觀念中完全解放出來，不再存「學而優則仕」的想頭，則科學家在中國必能更有他們崇高無上的榮譽。我們目前正在這轉變的過渡期中，一切都在蛻變，我們也要隨着一般科學研究的前輩先生，共同籲請政府社會都重視科學！</p>
<h3>世界女靑年大會</h3>
<p>（上接一版）外賓招待所位於西子湖畔實叔塔麓，面湖背山，環境甚爲優美，大會會塲設於外賓招待所會議廳，會塲布置簡潔莊嚴，四壁綴以事工統計比較表，及團體活動生活照片，中設主席台，舖以白色台布，台上　大瓶桂花，塲外園內桂花盛開，陣風吹來，滿室生香。大會主席萬恩思端坐正中，凌憲揚夫人及總幹事吳思莫分坐其旁，各代表坐椅則排列爲半圓形。大會伊始。爲肅穆莊車之靈修節目，全體代表宣讀聖經，齊唱讚美詩，並同聲祈禱。主席即依照代表名單，逐一點名，計劃代表及列席代表大會職員等，共爲一百三十餘人·點名完畢·凌達揚夫人代表中國靑年協會，奉贈鮮紅大木魚一隻，凌夫人乃解釋木魚爲杭州歷史各產，足資成爲世界女靑年會在中國開會之永久紀念，萬恩思主席肅立接受，嗣後几遇會塲中注意力分散，或有議案須付表決時，主席必敲打木魚，成爲控制會塲空氣之重要工具。繼由大會吳思莫總幹事讀世界各地婦女團體拍發之賀電，計卅餘通，其中數通係來自日本女靑年會，歷述彼等得知世界女靑年會在杭開幕，甚爲欣喜，渠等因格於環境，未能參加，遺憾與懊喪難以形容，按此次日本代表因遭遠東管制委員會之反對，致不克成行。又大會中到有德籍代表一人，惟樂對我國外交部曾有諒解，不得對外發表任何意見。</p>

<h3>朱家驊等致詞內容</h3>
<p>朱家驊開幕詞略稱：一年來學術空氣日漸濃厚，國內敎育發展，國際文化合作，在在需要此最高研究機關充實設備加强工作，但目前之困難，較抗戰時期甚或過之，中研院現正設法使分散各地之研究所逐漸集中首都，以維完整。此次評議會重要之意義，在着手完成嚴密之研究體系，先就各方面提名之院士候選人決定一候選人名單，俾於明春舉行選舉，充實中研院之基幹，展開工作，迎頭趕上西方學術文明。繼由吳文官長鼎昌代表蔣主席致意慰勉，李中監委石曾代表中央黨部祝賀會議成功，李氏並詳述國民黨自革命始即注重學術，民十七北伐成功後，中央政治會議在丁家花園開會，成過成立京，平；浙三研究院之原則，其後南京研究院在蔡孑民先生主持下，日一益發揚而成今日之中研院，渠一手創之北平研究院今仍屹立，渠一甚望兩者能密切合作，並擇適當時地舉行聯合大會。來賓致詞時，居正院長期望中研院能就形而上學域中，發現最高原則指導一切文化學術，王副院長雲五除代張院長祝賀會議成功外，並謂：渠對胡適校長最近關於學術獨立之主張甚表贊同「認爲留學生素質應予嚴審，减少名額，消除鍍金心理，每年節省外匯可達一百八九十萬元，用於充實國內大學實大有可爲。旋胡適代表評議員答詞，報吿院士選舉　委會經四次會議，已就各大學院校，研究學會及公務機關提出之五百一十人中完成初審程序，俟此次審　會決定候選人名單，並由政府公吿四月請全國人士據供意見後，即於明春五次會時予以選定，豈時學術體系得以究成，意義殊爲車大。胡氏並論及留學生可分兩類，一類爲可鄙之鍍金者，一類則爲眞正之學術研究者，渠近所提倡之學術獨立，着車於使大學爲研究機關，使國內大學學位較洋博士更爲榮譽而可員。渠並指出現在政府太不信任學府，要求把學位的授予權完全交予大學校，以免公文周折有辱學術尊嚴。翁文灝則認爲天變道亦變，科學進步極快，國內在設備待遇上均對不起人才，應遣之到外國研究。胡先　則認爲政府應注意去歲國防最高委員會通過之以全部國家稅收百分之一作科學專款之決議，早日兌現以加强國防科學研究。長後李石曾氏就留學事傳達吳稚老之意見謂，留學要在一外國發展，不一定花太多的錢，鍍金誠屬不必，然以留學吸收西方文化精神，則屬重要之事。</p>
<h3>金璧輝公審情形</h3>
<p>（上接一版）今日原定下午三時開審，過午持有旁聽證之人衆已擁擠高院後花園臨時法庭四周，統計二千餘人，四周樹上亦爬滿觀衆。法庭佈置於小方亭內，四周圍以牢固之杉桿，未開庭前，秩序尙可維持，及提到金　輝，秩序大亂，金坐車內，被困人業中半小時，始由軍警强行開道上庭，人聲鼎沸中，庭長吳盛涵與金之問答，尙須法營大聲傳話，書記官亦未能全部記錄，旋因杉桿被擠折斷，衆人一擁上前，記者與中電三廠之攝影人員皆被擠出，金之辯護人李宜琛，李曹，丁作韶三律師亦被隔離，被擠受傷者大有人在，法案幾被抬起，憲警雖多而束手無策。金着綠呢西服褲，白毛綫上身，襯以油亮之短髮，時含笑環顧觀衆，似頗感興趣者。金胸有成竹，答話沉着自然，迄下午四時，終在極度混亂下，庭上宣佈中止審訊，金則在羣衆擁擠中由法警送上汽車，押回一監。</p>
<p>庭長談話</p>
<p>事後，經吳庭長吿記者今日之問答要點，據稱金多逃避回答，但在其承認汪逆訪日時，渠曾代日方詢汪與蔣主席有聯絡否之供詞中，亦得一部份間諜證據。吳氏稱：金爲肅親王之女，三歲時由日人川島浪速抱養爲義女，幼受日皇族敎育，富武士道思想，浪速爲淸廷顧問，與肅親王等私交頗深，主中日親善，爲金取名川島芳子，同時輸芳子以中日親善思想，芳子知其爲滿淸親王之後，乃蓄意恢復滿淸，金自稱十六歲時居滬，數月後由其兄金璧東接至長春，適浦儀組僞滿，偽滿在北票組「定國軍」，欲收編雜軍，長白山獨立，金曾參與其事，後爲多田駿解決，金即返長春，而居多田左右，後到平，民卅年日方確曾將其押回國，而不能證實原因。</p>
<p>金之供詞</p>
<p>今日庭上所詢者，爲自僞滿成立，組「定國軍」，迄其誘說馬占山李杜附「滿」事，金對不利之點完全否認。金承認日方曾令其組「華北自衛軍」，自任總司令，雖授其印鑑，而渠未就。民卅年汪訪日時，渠曾與頭山滿一同晤汪，詢汪是否與蔣主席有聯絡？汪答，「以後再談」，金報吿日方則謂「無聯絡」。金否認曾與本莊，坂垣等共謀發動九一八事變。承認曾作近衛秘書，與東條夫人有過從，與多田駿，松岡洋右有深交。承認民卅年曾在津養傷，而諱言爲何種傷。此外在金之私信中，發見渠致人信輒自稱「本司令」，或署名「川島小皇子」，而金友人致金信中，則發現有勸其多活動，或評其男裝不宜其本身工作字句，此外並有寫金間諜活動之「男裝之麗人」小說。</p>

<h3>煙台初巡（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員邵慎之</p>
<p>烟台市區的奇山敎堂，在本星期日響起了二年來未打的鐘。記者在收復後第五天到達，這里，美國水兵比我們來得更早，有一條美國巡洋艦停在烟台港外。據丁綍庭巿吿稱：有一千個武工隊潛伏在市區，携有四百多支短槍，現在警察還沒有上崗，他自靑鳥帶來的少數士著警察、他們一到烟台，立刻一鬨地各自回家去探望了。商店陸陸續續打開門板，可是沒有貨物。許多昔日的鬧市，現夜十分淸冷，專做出口生意的進德街，大馬路，與戰前比較，現在幾乎是一條死街，有的房屋竟己倒閉。規定在十時戒嚴，可是不到七點鐘，除開大兵之外，就行人絕跡。這種緊張不安的情緖，相信不久將會逐漸消失。烟台現在有十七八萬人口，這比起剛爲國軍收復的膠東大城萊來陽，相去不啻　壤了。萊陽只有一千人</p>
<p>物資早運空到處有地雷</p>
<p>種種跡象，證明共　撤退工作起碼在一個多月以前已經準備，這是最可注意的一點。民衆說，過去一個月來，每天起碼有幾百板車的物資運到市外去，最多時一次達一千輛以上。市府在四十里外的山間，挖起埋入土中的電燈泡和錫子，（這些是最易　破的東西）自然還有無數的東西仍在土中。國軍一路自萊陽方面過來，不斷在土裏挖東西，包括救濟物資（衣服·藥品等）和軍火，成千發日本重砲子彈，只能就地破壞，而救濟物資則成爲「戰利品」。</p>
<p>我到達的時候，市內還在響地雷。共匪單夜海關附近，擋浪壩上，市府三處，就埋雷數百個之多，都是日本貨重雷。各處房屋，保險箱，几未經工兵檢查過的地方，都使人戒懼，寫着「地雷危險」的警吿字樣，而探雷器只有一個，實在是忙不過來了。</p>
<p>截止目前爲止，還沒有人能够舉出具體「證據」、指出蘇聯自大連方面向烟台作軍事接濟。但是民衆都能够記得，先後共有三條蘇聯運輸船自大迎開出烟台港內，除開鐵道鋼軌之外，不知有什麼物資運來，而鋼軌是不易包裝和掩護的來西。據估計，這種鋼軌可能做頗多的短槍，這是普通的　工廠都能做的。至於運回大連去的，則是糧食。但三船所裝，最多不會超出兩萬噸，而帆船和小火輪的運輸則是各方面所不易估訂的。國軍收復烟台後幾天，還有「難民」自大速坐帆船過來。黃浦江裏最小的舢小板，也同樣可以行駛在渤海口，來往於東北與山東之間，我看見當地的民衆實在操縱自如。大連日報幾乎是定時到達烟台，可是現在是沒有了。</p>
<p>偽鈔作了廢花邊廉於布</p>
<p>民衆們最突然的損失是「北海鈔」的作廢，一下子就把交換關係和金融活動完全凍結起來。於是，銀元銅板便成了主要的通貨，（原先也有市價），而軍隊則使用法幣，三天之內，一百元換當十銅元一枚的比價成了固定的行市，三萬元法幣換銀元一枚。膠東一帶，「北海鈔」以廿五元法幣比一元一直跌到以七元法幣換一元，以至完全作廢。烟台成爲法幣世界的第一天，有的士兵以一萬五千元購得皮鞋一雙，二十四小時內，以幾何級數猛跳三次，以後再以算術級數上昇。推測原因，可分兩種：一種是不知法幣的眞實價値；一種則是遏望獲得新的通貨。縱然貨物稀少，由於後一種原因，其價格還是十分低（與靑鳥，上海比餃），許多從裝束上看來是中產以上的婦女，也擺着地攤，他們都是亟待法幣來購換糧食的人，他們取出多年深藏的衣料物件，在街上擺賣，以換取數目可憐的法幣，可是這在目前對他們太有用。稍有良心的人必然會惑到有些東西簡直是劫奪，例如著名的花邊，巳經多年不能出口，現在便比土布在上海的巿價還低（以尺幅大小來比較）</p>
<p>軍差船來去民衆瞪眼看</p>
<p>記者搭台中貨輪到烟台，除軍艦外，這是第一艘商輪，但是服軍差，裝去軍用麵粉一萬袋，順便還有其他的搭客。民衆們塵集碼頭，看這船開進去。民衆們總是瞪着眼看這看那，把印象和意見埋藏在心底深處。一批軍官空着身子，帶着女眷上岸，他們瞪着眼看，及至這條軍差船在十二日駛回靑島時，便有鋼琴，沙發，傢具等隨着駛出港去，民衆們也瞪着眼看。有的已被埋在泥土裏，有的則在眼前隨彼而去，同是不知去向。烟台的「戰利品」也無非這些。如果要想尋一宗文件或報紙，或好一些的書，却不可能。我的勞力等於零。</p>
<p>可是英國領事館的檔案是究整無缺，並不是密藏得好，而是過去沒有撓出過。美國領事謝偉志，英國代理領事艾克夫，同丁綍庭巿長來得一樣怏，他們是隨桂永淸總司令所乘的娥媚號抵此的。外僑在烟台的，有法，意，英，希，四種國籍，總共不足廿人，都窮得像「畢三」，但比甲國人，生活總在水準以上。談到過去的情形，都不願有何意兌，主要的是力謀恢復其產業。（未完）</p>

<h3>召開國會特會希望微薄　美修訂援歐程序　緊急援助延至明夏終止</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電﹞杜魯門內閣於研究國會之態度及緊急措施之可能性後，巳在重新編製援外之時間表。政府官員雖力言尙未成立決議，但稱關於取消於十二月初召開國會特別會之計劃，已在考慮之中。權宜援助計劃將展延至一九四八年六片卅日爲止之會計年度年底，而馬歇爾計劃則將於彼時後立即開始。此一新計劃有賴於兩點之廓淸：　國會能肯定允諾，於明年一月初復會時，就權宜援助計劃，採取迅速而適當之行動否？　不經國會通過，能獲權宜援助所需之炎金否？進出口銀行及物品貸款銀團之首次參加昨日白宮之車要會議，使人相信權宜援助資金得不經國會而獲得。進出口銀行旣巳允許法國以原供建設計劃用之貸款計九千萬元，移作支付必需物品價款之用，朱始不能以該行八億元之資本，或至少其中之一部份，作爲緊急援助法義之用。美政府人士謂：放棄召開國會特別會之計劃，使政府及國會均感不快。許多官員相信，如能使國會保持不生氣之態度，並斷定其得以通過適當之緊急資金，供作一九四八年上半年六個月內之援助費用，然後再事審查歐洲之通盤長期復興計劃，則援助計劃之得經國會順利通過，必有更大的成功希望。頃悉：歐洲十六國經濟合作委員會主席弗朗克斯爵士昨訪美副國務卿洛維特及克萊頓時，已曾非正式談及美政府之前一計劃。同時法義兩國形勢，已趨好轉，法國除已獲進出口銀行之准許，以動用九千萬元之貸款外，並可分得納粹所刧黃金價値約九千萬元，日本所刦黃金價約値約三千六百萬元。此外，因美國軍隊在法國而田美國給予法國之報酬約五千萬元，亦已在巴黎談判中。義大利可望自納粹被刦黃金中獲得價値約三千萬元之黃金。</p>
<p>﹝合衆社華盛頓十四日電﹞召集美國會特別會議之機會日益减少，國會方面人士報吿，杜魯門總統迄未取得共和黨方面之保證，限制會議祗討論五億八千萬元援外法案。據稱:參院外委會主席范登堡報吿政府首長稱:渠信以「一包」方式應付歐洲經濟危機，事實上不可避免。擁護政府者相信，范氏之言意在將長期馬歇爾復興計劃與杜魯門要求權宜援助法義奧渡過冬季之緊急法案合併。民主黨參議員私人談話稱：此舉將逼令彼等支持歐洲復興之方案，雖此計劃所需之確數尙未定奪。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖十四日電〕叙利亞代表齊尼丁今日提出警吿稱：聯合國所建議之巴勒斯坦警察力，必將引起流血，如叙利亞予以同意，即無異招致戰爭與毀滅也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕蘇聯在聯合國機構中支持巴勒斯坦之分治，首次引起蘇軍進駐東地中海之問題。美代表詹森於上週六在聯大巴勒斯坦特委會中闡述美國之態度時，曾表示維持過渡期間之法律與秩序起見，需耍由聯合團微募志願人員，組織特警隊，如果蘇聯於在原則上同意分治之後，復表示願意協助執行此一解決辦法，則料蘇公民之願充任志願警察者必甚踴躍。</p>
<h3>託管委員會通過印建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十四日電﹞聯合國託管委員會今日雖經握有殖民地國家及美國之竭力反對，卒以廿五對廿三票，三票棄權通過贊成託管制度乃促使世界殖民地獨立捷徑之決議，此一決議係印度所提出者。</p>
<h3>法罷工潮擴大政府籌商對策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十五日電﹞共黨指使下：巴黎交通工人罷工，已歷兩日，法內閣十五日舉行聚急會議商討對策。賴瑪迪總理報吿勞工問題之嚴重性，以及政府之緊急措置，目前政府與工人間已陷於完全僵局。賴瑪迪稱，渠決不再與勞工總會舉行談判，巴黎各工會將於十六日集會，可能又將引起若干處同情罷工。目前法國工潮共有五起，巴黎交通工人·雷諾特汽車廠·美國鐵路工人·巴黎曳引機廠以及氣象台等。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社巴黎十四日電〕法政府今日採取堅決措施，應付交通工人之罷工。政府已徵用私人公共汽車三百輛，維持都會之最低限度交通。並徽召臨時車夫開駛車輛，軍用卡車一千五百輛暫供載客，但工潮今夜開始擴大至其他工業。</p>

<h3>克萊頓辭職</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社華盛頓十四日電﹞據可靠方面悉：馬歇爾計劃主要籌劃人之一副國務卿克萊頓，已向杜魯門總統提出辭呈。克氏辭職主因爲個人康健問題，渠現年六十七歲，爲美國有數之百萬富商之一，一月前即提出辭職，由馬歇爾挽留至今。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾預言　蘇將退出聯合國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十四日電〕邱吉爾十四日廣播稱：蘇聯及其衛屋國可能退出聯合國，造成兩個世界，惟此分裂並不一定引起戰爭。邱氏演辭之直率，類似渠去年在富爾敦之演說。渠稱事實上蘇聯之退出乃一佳事，蓋雙方由此可以知己知彼矣。邱翁稱，戰爭之發生，由於交戰兩方相信勢力相等，然如蘇聯及其附庸退出聯合國，另組獨立之集團時，雙方勢力絕不至於均等。</p>
<h3>聯合國經濟小組贊同馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>﹝聯合社成功湖十四日電〕聯合國大會經濟小組會今日表決贊同馬歇爾經濟援歐計劃，斯拉夫集團國家獨持異議。</p>
<h3>聯合國設置小型大會案　我國有條件支持　蘇持異議譏美勇於玩火</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞紐約十五日廣播：成功湖訊：聯大政治委員會今日開會，中國及烏拉圭兩國支持美國所提成立五十五國「小型大會」之建議，惟中國代表顧維鈞力主「小型大會」之權力，應加以限制。</p>
<p>﹝合衆社成功湖十四日電﹞蘇聯今日攻擊美國提交聯大會主張設立過渡「小型聯合國大會」之建議。美代表杜勒斯在政委會提出建議後，蘇代表維辛斯基即起立聲稱，「如美國願意不將朝鮮問題之類列入議程，則大會當可不致「工作過度」。渠重申蘇聯之建議，如美國答應撤軍，蘇軍將撤離朝鮮，「由韓人自己決定政府之體制」。</p>
<p>維氏稱，「美國一方面稱大會工作過於沉重，而另一方面，議程儘多不必要之題目，如朝鮮之獨立等題，此事慶在今年底軍隊撤離後，直接提交韓人，議程上更有極困難而易引起糾紛之課題。閣下有何理由將之列入議程？此舉大悖邏輯及理諭。」維辛斯基攻擊美建議稱，「杜勒斯不敢直稱渠有隱衷不能宣佈，瘋人常以玩火爲樂，然大國如美國之負責人物竟亦勇於玩火，誠爲憾事。美國之建議曾得玻利維亞迅速之援助，然此建議不僅無法達成聯合國成立之旨趣，且可能引起相反的效果，不能增强聯合國，適足以减弱之。此建議將削弱反對販賣戰爭之惡勢力。「小型大會」成立後，美國以整批謊言宣傳製造新戰爭之努力，亦可無阻碍矣。蘇聯代表團相信現時任何削弱聯合國之情形，均足以滋長新的戰爭販子。杜勒斯或已渾忘此事，否則杜氏必無胆量說明此事。」維辛斯基稱，「美國之建議雖有其秘密性質，最後訓示美國對聯合闕程序之進行方式不滿之至。美國發覺以合法手績取消否決權爲不可能時，乃出之於他法。蘇聯代表團相信，美國之建議僅爲其計劃之一部份，目的不在尊重憲章，而在以同類之委員會替代安理會，以取消大國間之全體協議，蓋此一點正使美國無法在聯合國中取得獨裁權也。」</p>
<h3>安理會理事難產</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十五日電〕安理會理事選舉之　局，似尙不易打破。拉丁美洲代表團昨夜再度召開秘密會議，想彼等對於支持烏克蘭之立塲，無甚變更。謠傳拉丁美洲六國將轉而支持印度之設，尙不能證實。</p>
<h3>美陸軍吿誡士兵防蘇聯可能攻擊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美國陸軍十四日印就小册，分發世界各地美軍，內客係警吿三軍，蘇聯擬藉控制歐洲大陸之助，可以向「任何方向」發動攻勢戰爭。小册係供美軍司令官，訓迪士兵之世界地理政洽知識。並稱，蘇聯可西向以入歐洲，東向出中國，北越北極而臨北美洲。蘇聯之地理形勢特別有利於攻勢而不利於守勢，蓋蘇境幅員浩森。兵力易於分散。</p>
<h3>史達林　長期休養</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電﹞莫斯科電台今日廣播，透露史達林總理現在黑海區休養。據該電台稱，史氏曾在黑海區沙基地方接見來蘇考察之英國會工黨議員入人。史氏將於本月廿一日度其六十入歲壽辰。渠自戰爭結束以來，即在沙基長期休養。</p>
<h3>蘇聯黃金運美</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕商務部宣布，今年九月廿四日為止一星期內，蘇聯曾以價値五·六二四·二八六美元之黃金運至美國，此數等於該星期外國運美黃金總額三分之一以上·南非運美黃金總値七·八七七·四一入美元，超過總額之半數。</p>
<h3>羅馬巿選舉結果揭曉　左右翼勢均力敵　加斯具利內閣傳將改組</h3>
<p>﹝聯合社羅馬十四日電﹞市議會選舉今日最後檢票結果，共黨控制之人民集團與基督民主黨，可在市議會中八十席各占廿七席。兩黨票數相差不足百分之一，其餘票數則爲各小黨分得，自左翼溫和派至法西斯派均有。雙方旣係勢均力敵，預料新議會對於推選市長問題，殆將陷於僵局。</p>
<p>﹝路透社羅馬十四日電﹞據悉基督民主黨擬以現任國防部長秦谷拉尼爲市長，此舉證實加斯貝利於市選舉結束後將改組內閣之說。若千左翼溫和派共和黨及社會工人黨領袖薩拉迦特，可望參加內閣。</p>
<h3>安理會討論印荷爭端　我支持英國建議　蔣廷黻表示同情印尼獨立運動</h3>
<p>﹝中央社成功湖十四日電〕我代表蔣廷黻，今於安理會中發表演說稱，中國支特印尼獨立遝動，但對印尼軍隊中非正規部隊所加諸平民之種種暴行，不能同意，更難予以支持。吾人認爲此種舉動，實非步向獨立之適當途徑。</p>
<p>余雖接獲甚多印尼華僑伸訴渠等遭受印尼非正規軍虐待之電文，然余迄未提交安理會，因：　余不願阻碍及此兄弟之邦人民之獨立運動；　印尼各領袖對於阻止暴行，曾有誠懇之努力。印尼之華僑，雖遭受種種虐苦，然在致中國政府及余本人之電報中，仍主張印尼應於政洽上獲得獨立。中國政府可以贊成蘇所提荷軍全部撤退之建議，亦可贊成澳洲所提荷軍作有限制之撤退之建議，但此必須獲得各種惡劣情况下繼荷軍撤退而發生之保證，因目前此種保證，尙付缺如，故中國代表團贊成英國之建議，即此問題應交付三人委會及領事委會處理。</p>
<h3>日圓外滙率　我主張鄭重決定　對日管委會曾作討論</h3>
<p>﹝新亞社東京十五日電〕對日管制委員會十五日舉行會議，由主席美代表西鮑德報吿，若不確定日圓匯率，則對外貿易不能充分發展，故應盡量從早確定匯率，並稱此乃麥帥之意旨。出席各代表對此多表贊同。中國代表稱：為復興日本之貿易，誠宜速定日圓外匯率，惟日本之經濟尙未恢復常態，而確定匯率乃現實問題，尤須注意不使影響於日本之工資物價體系，故須愼重決定之。英蘇代表亦表示確定匯率殊為必要。嗣決定將此問題，交下次會議再行討論。</p>
<h3>巴西與蘇聯有絕交可能</h3>
<p>〔路透社里約瑟內　十四日電〕巴西外長　南台資今日承認，由於蘇聯官方報紙消息報刊載侮辱巴西總統杜特拉之文字，巴西可能與蘇聯斷絕外交關係。巴西政府前已為此事正式向蘇抗議。</p>
<h3>法軍展開攻勢法領高平城</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：海防訊，據法方消息，法軍已估領海防北方一百八十七哩之高平城，而將維明與中國共黨間之聯絡切斷，軍火之走私，可望絕跡，維明軍隊已無法向中國廣西省方面退却矣。</p>
<h3>波蘭行第七信　鐵簾背後社會浮相　寂寞的波蘭人（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>「柏克外長」在戰爭初起時，死在羅馬尼亞，共產黨執政以後，畢蘇斯基「開國」的功業，也被一筆勾銷，華沙城中心的畢蘇斯基廣塲，現在改名爲「勝利廣塲」，塲上原有的畢氏銅像己經拆去，銅墻下面的波蘭復國（一九一四—一九一八）無名英雄墓，仍然享受著蒔花香草的祭奠。雖然，從純粹理論上說來，共產黨曾經否認那一次的「復國運動」，出諸波蘭人民的願望。</p>
<p>盧布林政府獨立節那天，我在畢蘇斯基廣塲巡禮了整個下午，那是一座舉仿几爾賽一樣的勝地，成千波蘭男女老幼，彼此都在那兒看熟鬧，其實，看熟鬧也是假的，因爲除了共產黨的擴音機廣播以外，根本沒什麼熱鬧可言，彼此祇是人看人，來消磨他們寂寞的歲月。</p>
<p>波蘭人是寂寞的，我覺得用「寂寞」來形容今天波蘭人的精神生活，一點不過份。戰爭和災難，使波蘭死亡了九百萬年靑壯丁，有一張華沙的小報上說：現在一個波蘭的年靑男子，平均有十九個年靑姑娘來追求，愛情在華沙，以及其他許多波蘭的城鎭中，都在一個不平衡的「偶力」中發展，跟愛情聯帶在一起的精神生活，尤其寂寞得可怕。</p>
<p>在夕陽西沈以後的某一個黃昏，我在華沙最熱鬧的「麻薩可斯加」大馬路閒步，一大羣寂寞的波蘭人，圍觀着兩個醉漢的吵架，人羣像浪漸一樣地往復去來，就這樣用來消磨他們寂寞的歲月。</p>
<p>波蘭政府現在也在竭力做文化建設的工作，內閣文化部標榜了一句「提供精神生活」的口號。我在外交部國際宣傳處的記者招待會上，很有興趣的一次，是聽文化部戲劇運動負責人的報吿，那位先生說：波蘭在納粹鐵蹄佔領期間，有整整六年沒有戲劇，光復以後，許多戲院的建築被摧毀，「劇運」工作者從廢墟上，着手做荆棘叢生的重建工作。到目前爲止，波蘭己經有三十三個規模宏大的「國家劇院」，散佈全國的小規模的國營劇團數達八千。過去一年間，全國戲院的觀衆總數達十萬萬人，較戰前增加四倍，文化部而且創辦了三座高級戲劇專科學校，並且負責提高全國各地演員的生活薪津。戰前一個演員，平均拿四千至六千波幣，現在增加到一萬四千至三萬二千波幣（月薪）。他說：「因爲物價上漲，戲劇工作者的物質生活，還是艱苦的。」</p>
<p>他說：解救波蘭全國的精神生活，是不容易的，文化部現在和「全國戲劇協會」密切聯繁，提倡工作競賽，特別是波蘭大戲劇家「維斯庶斯基」和莎士比亞名劇的競演。有十四家國家戲院，參加這一項工作競賽，成績特別好。他還說：戲劇協會是波蘭全國的作家·演員·藝術家·合併組織的。文化部最近新撥了一萬萬元，獎勵給成績卓著的戲院經理和演員。</p>
<p>記者會上，頗有幾個了解戲劇的「內行人」，英美記者特別有興趣的，是波蘭人瘋狂的歡迎莎士比亞的戲劇，此外，蕭伯納的劇本寫作，也有被譯成波蘭文的。一年多來，文化部翻譯了近百部國外名劇，俄國戲劇如渥斯屈洛芙斯基，戈果里，和雪穆諾夫的作品，也相當地配合波蘭觀衆的胃口。「大約有五分之一的戲院文化部指定奪門上演年靑作家的優秀作品，波蘭政府對有希望的靑年戲劇作者，有特別的獎勵金。虔誠的天主敎徒，二十多歲的羅斯狄勞斯脫，和生物學的學生奇斯芙斯加，都曾經先後獲得這一項獎金。」</p>
<p>可惜的是，我始終沒有機會看到華沙演出的戲劇競賽，在萬分倉促的逗留中，華僑朋友卓進蘭夫婦，邀我看了一塲俄國電影，那天是禮拜日，有好幾家電影院，指定給共產黨黨員免費看戲，旁人都不得入，我們在麻薩哥斯加大馬路南段一家商營電影院門前徘徊，有迎面兜生意的「黃牛票」黑巿。朋友們說：看電影買票，在華沙不是一件頂容易的事。我常常想起這句話，想起那些寂寞的彼闌人！</p>

<h3>六電力公司同聲歎苦　一致要求涨价十月初起追收　否则上海将成黑暗世界</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各公用事業調整價格，中央日內即可決定。電力價格，各公司要求自十月一日起實行，計上海電力公司及滬西電力公司要求調整爲每度二千七百元（目前每度一千一百三十元）。法商永電公司要求調整爲每度三千三百四十元（目前每度一千一百三十二元）。華商電氣公司及浦東電氣公司要求調整爲每度三千三百六十元（目前每度一千二百五十五元）。閘北水電公司要求調整爲每度三千三百七十元（日前每度一千二百六十元）。該項新價如經中央核准，將自十月一日起追收。</p>
<p>六大公司爲電價問題，特於昨日下午四時假南京路上海電力公司六樓招待記者。出席上海電力霍浦金，汪經鎔。法商水電薛孟，楊光裕。華商電氣黃炳　，閘北水電陸子冬，浦東電氣童受民及各報記者三十餘人。席間各公司代表相繼報吿困難情形稱，公司至今仍依七月一日調整之價格收費，但外匯已自一萬二千元調整至五萬六千元。各公司原料需用外匯者佔百分之八十，如不從速調整電價，即將虧蝕至不能維持。各公司並一致要求實行自動調整電價方式，以謀一勞永逸。</p>
<p>上海電力公司每日虧卅三億</p>
<p>上海電力公司工程師汪經鎔解釋追收電費稱：此項追收電費辦法完全合理，蓋以上海電力公司爲例，自九月二十五日調整外匯後至今，每日虧蝕三十三億，至今二十天支出一千一百二十億，而收人祗四百六十億，　蝕達六百六十億，公司無力償付此數，抵能取自用戶。電力成本之主要項目爲燃料及維持用材料，供應品，薪金以及資金上之基本費用。自七月一日調整電價至今，莫不飛漲，故申請自十月一日起調整普通用戶電價爲每度國幣二千七百元。該項推算係假定燃油之百分之五十進口稅按上海電力公司合同價格征收，倘進口稅按市價計，則每度再將增加國幣三百六十元。現在新電價未蒙核准以前，公司每月虧蝕超過九百九十億，此種情形只須繼續一短暫時期，公司將無力購燃料，發工資，而上海亦將無電力之供應云。</p>
<p>閘北水電公司陸子冬稱：該公司全部用煤。由燃管會撥配。即單依煤價算，其他開支不計，應一度電即需一千五百元，但現今電費每度爲一千二百六十元，故蜜無法維持。</p>
<p>法商水電希望減少用戶浪費</p>
<p>法商水電公司楊光裕稱：該公司全爲柴汕發電機。區內多住戶，工業用電祗百分之二十，故希望能提高住戶電燈電費，而抑低生產用電電費，使减少用戶浪費而增加生產。華商電氣公司黃炳權稱：該公司戰前一萬六千　之發電機於上海淪陷期間爲日人運往華北，至今百分之八十電力購自上海電力公司，因輸電錢路長達三十五公里，沿途損失甚大，故要求調整之電價與上海電力公司稍有不同。蘇州十月份之電價每度爲五千六百六十元，其他各地有每度高至一萬元以上者，故上海電價實爲低康。浦東電氣公司繼亦報吿該公司之虧蝕情形要求從速調整。</p>
<p>調整方式　今日討論</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕公用局前擬呈之本市公用事業價格自動調整方式，電機工程師學會鍾兆琳·洪傳烱兩專家研究後，巳擬具意見書送局。公用局特定於今日下午舉行車談會，綜合各方意見，加以討論。</p>
<p>又公用局長趙曾玨爲燃料油進口稅問題，昨日訪國行張總裁，要求依電力公司合同價征收，而不依市價計算，以減輕電力成本。張總裁表示允可，並即致電財政部洽辦。</p>
<h3>汽車用油限額決分三級配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市汽車用油限額辦法將有改變。汽車用油限額審查委員會昨曾開會，咸認有改進必要，決定將小汽車及卡車依戰重噸位分爲大中小型三級，分配實際用油量。詳細辦法由今日召開之市參議會公用小組討論決定</p>

<p>認定義務·不是權利</p>
<p>繼請蔣指導員經國致訓，略謂：「此次舉辦選舉，爲本黨歷史上一件重大的工作，現在共匪禍國殃民，戡亂軍事短期內尙難結束，物價高漲不巳，人民痛苦極深，辦理選舉，非常困難。但中央爲顧全環境需要，配合革命程序，雖在艱難困苦之中，仍決定如期舉辦。我們份屬黨員，應當體諒到黨的困難和總裁的苦衷，絕對服從黨的命令，以合法的行動從事競選，爲民主政治樹立一個良好的模範。各位同志爲黨服務，有光榮的歷史，對社會有偉大的貢獻，希望首光認定競選是黨員的義務，不是權利，應當爲顧全黨的利益而犧牲個人的利益。現在各地發生許多不合理的競選現象如酒食微逐，暴力脅迫等，在上海都不應該有。總之，希望各位服從中央的規定，從事合理的競選活動，以减少黨的困難，使上海的選舉工作順利完成，作全國各地的楷模。」</p>
<p>個人利益·應當犧牲</p>
<p>詞畢後，請吳市長至詞，略謂：　競選人應以被選爲義務，不以被選爲權利，同時要犧牲個人的利益，維護黨的利益。　競選麼採合法活動，不得以非法方式進行選舉，並應效法民主國家政黨選舉之作風，以資　　。至此，方主委復　　各競選人：　應即發動分往各區向人民演說，以配合戡亂建國。　應以文字口頭各種宣傳代替酒食徵逐。詞畢，競選人羅敦偉，程中行，潘公嚴，陳培德，邱希聖等，復相繼發表意見，情緖極爲熱烈，至五時許，由方主委歸納各人意見，作一具體結論，並略進茶點後，宣吿散會。</p>

<h3>工人生活指數允予改善編製</h3>
<p>總工會理事長水祥雲等昨赴社局，提出改善指數編製之建議：　食米一項政府仍以民國廿五年之頭號西貢及二號老米作基期價格。但目前指數中之食米，乃爲配給米之蕪秞，米質甚劣，應將基期價格改正。　房租價格，市府擬定甚低，尤其爲房租中之水費一項，計算不確。　日用品項目中之米，煤，油等，均根據配給品價格編製，事實上有若干工人，並未配到，仍購黑市煤，油。應於編製指數時改正。當由吳局長及張統計處長逐一答復，關於第一項米價，待市府詳查廿五年基期價格後再作決定。第二項房租價格市府已改善計算，即將其中主要之水費一項，原爲六個月調查一次者，改爲三個月調查一次。第三項，市府擬於每月月終，再編製以市價計算煤，油等之指數一種，與原來以配給價編製之指數相較，核計其差額。倘工廠不代工人領配給品者，則除工資之外，再增發前項差額金。此點由張處長於明日市政會議中提出通過後，即予施行云。</p>

<h3>六菜一湯價格難定　酒菜表示　將影響營養</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自當局公佈筵席節約辦法後，昨酒菜業同業公會曾召集本市十五帮菜館會員，商討；六菜一湯之價格問題，迄晚尙未有決議，聞將於十八日繼續開會商討。據該業各會員菜館表示。此次筵席節約辦法，一部份較大菜館所受影嚮最鉅，六菜一湯之限制，可能使彼等營業總額减少一半。惟六多數中等采館目前均以出售小吃及客飯爲主，事實上筵席甚少，故節約辦法對彼等不致有何影響。至由公會自行談價一點。在此物價動盪之際，困難亦多。並聞西菜業亦將在日內召開會議商訂二菜一湯之價格。</p>

<h3>校長女生公庭對薄　蔣儒珍提理由兩點自言決無禽獸行爲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市西倉路六十四號私立華德小學校長蔣儒珍，連續奸汚該校十三歲女生朱月仙及張菊英等一案，事發蔣潛逃江陰，被捕歸案，昨晨在地院刑一庭開審，孟推事首提蔣儒珍審訊，蔣衣灰布短衫褲，　髮微白，緊咬下唇，時露獰笑，供稱：「五十五歲，江陰人，任華德校長八年，朱月仙，張菊英均爲三年級學生，與我毗隣」。孟推事詢以去年三月呌朱月仙上樓，以補習爲名，將其强姦，有此事否？蔣矢口否認。朱月仙突於證人席巾呼日「儂弗要賴！」旁聽席上咸爲側目。庭上復詰被吿，汝於本年六月又强姦張菊英，承認否？蔣連稱沒有，並謂：「若有這種事，我，簡直是禽獸了。」繼由朱月仙供述稱。。去年三月廿某日，上午七時許，與另一女生周長命同被蔣姦汚情形，又謂，蔣於事後恐嚇我等不許緊張，否則即將打死我等。嗣於今年六月二日上午七點許，又被姦汚一次，始吿知我母，報警捕緝，張菊英稱：「去年六月某日上午九時，蔣以補習國語爲名，喚我上樓，用强姦汚·事後，至本年朱月仙報警，我始謂與母聽，即到市立醫院檢騐」。至此庭詢蔣是否承認？蔣搖頭示否。問：然則彼等因何吿你？蔣答:「說來話長，朱月仙的母親與我隣居，我常到她家打牌，今年二月一日，朱母向我借二百萬元，一直未還，經我追償數次，始於五月廿九日命朱月仙喚我去拿，比至弄口即遇十數流氓聽住，間我何故常帶女生至城隍廟去玩，有人謂你幹不正當行爲，你，向我索詐五百萬，我即與一壽器店老關朱長貴商量，不料朱與朱月仙的母親同謀，報警緝我。」朱月仙之母朱胡茂珠謂：「我知道這事後，翌日即向蔣詰詢，呌月仙上樓緊閉房門何事？將不答，十分鐘後始連稱：朱師母，請你原諒」。我恨極，上前打他耳光一紀，他請我別動氣，呌我坐坐，我再上前打耳光一記，始偕月仙往醫院檢騐後　蓬萊警局。至於蔣說與我有姘居關係，全非事實。」蔣末申辯二點謂：　以我的年齡地位而言，均不致幹此事，　我校內年齡較大，十七八歲至廿餘歲的女生女敎員都有，要轉念頭，也不會轉到十三歲幼女的頭上。庭諭本案改期再審。</p>

<h3>秋時節　參觀長安兩絲廠</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十日訊〕長安，地處滬杭綫的要　，她擁有長安和連元兩個絲廠。記者得着一個機會，特地去訪問一番。長安絲廠有一百九十二台的繅絲機，大半都是二十五年的多條式，還有製繭機是千葉式的，有兩個發電機，一個是用榮油作燃料，計有三十二匹馬力，一個用煤做燃料，計爲二十八匹馬力，每大出絲爲三担半，工人有五百多，女工多於男工，他們還有檢驗室，用皮黑板和電光照射絲的勻度與是否有結子。他們廠中還有一種舊式的坐繅機，空氣比較壤一點，水蒸氣與蠶繭的氣味交流着，使人非常不慣，還有復繅車，是把繅過的絲再繅一次，並有整理間，打成一絞一絞的，這裏也用一個簡單的機器，這機器也是日本造的。還有揀選的功夫，有一個機器，專門去除繭上的絨皮，並選出好的繭十，但這個機器聽說也是日本製造的。打成一絞一絞後，便再打成包，每小包有三十絞也呌三十片，每一件有三十小包，一件相等一關担。</p>
<p>政府貸款收繭</p>
<p>據廠裏的負責人吿訴記者：「政府貸款給我們收繭，繭收得後就繅絲，絲繅成後交給政府，由政府輸往國外爭取貿易的市塲　。最近，我們輸往國外的蠶絲似稍有生機，故最近絲價尙稱高昂不，過在絲廠方面，僅能獲得一些工作的費用，最多只提一二成，在廠方自然是不滿足的。廠裹的負責人說：「廠方的開支也很浩大的。」</p>
<p>迥轉千葉其他</p>
<p>我再去參觀連元絲廠，連元廠有一百八十台，新式的廻轉機有三十六台，固定的像長安絲廠千葉式之繅機有一百三十四台，所謂迴轉，就是把水裏的繭子隨便的放到針鈎門子上，就會繅起來，這固定的却不同了，他必須把繭子的絲放在一定的針鈎門子上始會繅，這其問迥轉式要省時多了，工作效率自然增强得多。現在，這個廠裏的最新式繅絲機，一人可管十個門子，但日本有一種最新式的，一個人可管四十個門子，當比我們的製造效率高出一倍。</p>
<p>酌收手續費用</p>
<p>述元廠其他所有的機子與過程都和長安廠相同，不過缺少一種檢驗問，如果要把我們的絲行銷國外，檢驗這一步手續自也缺不來的。他們有一發電機，計六十個開羅瓦特。他們每天也可出絲三担。也是由政府貸款收繭，再由廠方收來後繅絲，絲繅成後交給國家貿易外洋，其間也收一些手續費用。</p>
<p>缺乏競進興趣</p>
<p>以上兩個絲廠都是私人集股經營的，在浙江省說起來，規模也不算太小，但我曾問他們能否自己出資收繭，他們說：「現在，每祖繭十要一百多萬元，我們的資本額是不够應付的。不過，政府如果老是這樣貸款給絲廠收繭，絲廠繅成絲後供給政府，僅收一點手續費，則產品的優良程度會减低的，工作的認眞態度也曾減輕的。」這幾句話至少可以供政府當局參考，政府原爲吸取外匯整頓絲的產品，故如此做法，這個做法是可以防免繭商的從中漁利，又可免得絲商的剝削，並以劣品破壞國際的信譽，可謂比較的合理的。不過，對絲廠的產品以及工作效能上應該加以獎勉，以使他們有競進的興趣。</p>
<p>需要自已創造</p>
<p>我看這兩個廠，差不多都是用日本的機器，原來我國在國際上的絲市塲很早，當時沒有日本的絲價，只有中國的絲價，可惜我們的先輩沒有弄得好，以致國際上看重了日本絲，反沒有了我國的絲價。我們也不能怨天尤人，日本人埋頭研究，我們自暴自棄，從今天起，我們要自己研究，自己創造，決不要再依賴別人，我們也要自已發明繅絲機與製　機才好。</p>
<p>核定收繭價格</p>
<p>秋繭要收了，政府貸給各廠家爲一百〇八萬元一擔。據廠方人員說：農民要一百八十萬元一擔才肯脫手，否則情願做土絲。問土絲的出路如何？他們吿訴記者：土絲可以送綢行織綢。無諭如何，政府爲了要獎勵絲繭事集，那麼對絲繭事業的原料產地應該有一明確的調查，事實是事實，也不能憑報吿，更不能自己杜撰，應該根據統計制定收繭的價格，使今年秋絲在國際市塲上露出嶄新的頭角！（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<p>次說自然科學組，已派Mr.Jan　Smid於十月三日離巴赴華，在南京創辦遠東區自然科學合作處。</p>
<p>次說在聯合國文教組織內所舉行的各種國際會議。如國際數劇專家會議，中國原請余上源出席，余木趕到，臨時由在巴之謝壽康出席，議設國際戲劇學院，中國被舉為籌備委員之一，如戰害國新聞事業無綫電及電影材料需要會議，中國代表由馮商出席，議決須有美金五百萬元之報章用紙救濟中國，法國，及荷蘭三國。又議決中國無綫電收音機至少須有一千八百萬具，培養專家三百人，學校應用之放送機九十萬具。又議決電影救濟費須美金二千萬至二千五百萬元，其中百分之十為發展大片之用，百分之九十為製造教育影片之用，他認定中國為最須救濟之一國。又議決在巴黎籌設國際新聞學院，預計每年用費為美金二十萬至二十五萬元，此款由聯合國文教組織供給一部份，由各會員國家捐助一部份。此種決議，將提交行將在墨西哥舉行之第二屆常年大會討論，作為最後的決定。又如哲學人文會議，中國原有在聯教組織中之哲學頭問羅忠恕，及臨時趕到出席之陶孟和，他們的工作與意見，絢為各國所注意及歡迎。（未完）</p>

<p>上半時　籃球裁判員原油定的兩位，未見到塲，由劉荷生臨時庖代。征榆于瑞章屠文龍兩球迎中，忠强繼之，七比（今監勢煊赫。油隊立德燦希，近投中的，維聰再馴身手，十比九反見超出。十二比十，征輸遂一路順風，上半時結果，廿七比十九，客軍有聲有色。休息時報告券資所得，為一千二百八十五萬元。</p>

<h3>華聯足球隊　戰和星洲英空軍　二比二滬隊表演遜色</h3>
<p>〔路透社報新加坡十五日電〕滬華聯足球隊昨日在此間貝薩運動塲，過舉家空軍：戰成各二平手。滬隊表演，不如前此之佳，尤以開賽初期為甚。開費十分鐘，英隊即獲一球，滬隊不甘示弱，由韓龍海還敬一球，以從進入拉鋸戰階段，直至上半時終了。下半時開賽之初，英隊氣焰甚盛，又中一球，惟好景不常，滬隊李垚，不久即破英軍之門。其後雙方球門前，雖均慶呈險象，但球終未入網，結果以二比二和。</p>
<h3>征輪現况　表演有顯著的進步</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕從昨晚一幕籃球義賽中，看到「征輸」的現况，比較起今年五月間來滬時的情服，　　進　了許多。</p>
<p>目前的「屈輸」　當　不同，已經知道　惜　　權，惠日限見的中　　轉，　　少到最低的限度。昨夕大破汕隊，于，牘。　人的　　，大部突入盛下擲進，作　　出手，漸上軌　，而輕汕　　　，就得力在這幾點上。</p>
<p>以　歐而　，「　　」成了一個穩健，有組織，有明腦的勸旅，俱依然保持　員的並度和射中　，所以，「征輸」是進小了。間人方　，干　　取代了　日歷文能的地位，成為進分與　陣的　將，他是　　輸」　中進　最連的一員。</p>
<p>油隊之敗，很難　　在「球運」上，在進攻時，油隊雖能充份利用　人戰　，俱苦干　　缺乏把　，而「征輸」守衛的　　，　屬全色。常泊便汕　在外團　汕，無法突破最後的一關。汕隊一向倚軍林　憑，陳淸江兩人獲分，昨賽淸江失常，而林的四十五度角中距離射籃，角度雖已放寬，便失却準度，也是失敗的一個原因。「征輪」的進步，給予「華聯」重大的威脅。（昌年）</p>

<h3>在當局嚴密監視之下　米麵油糧開始回跌　業中人希望疏導來源獎勵販運</h3>
<p>本市軍　當局以雷霆萬鈞力量，壓抑物價，查辦囤積操縱人物。人心虛弱，紛紛吐售。昨日各物已普遍下跌，南北兩市共到米糧一萬二千石有零，市塲一片　出聲，各糧全面下降。白粳中次跌三五萬元，秈米挫三四萬元，白元跌二三萬元。麵粉消化呆滯，供多求少，跌二萬元，麩皮跌萬餘元。食油市塲交易寥寥，僅油行油號對做極少數交易。油廠開價，並無大戶過問，當日簍生油二一〇萬元，（曾高達二三〇萬元），豆油二〇〇萬元，（會高達二二五萬元），生菜汕一六五萬元，（會高達一九〇萬元），熟菜油一四〇萬元，（曾高達一六〇萬元），生蔴油一九〇萬元，（曾高達二一五萬元），原料亦有同樣趨勢，生仁已由一〇一萬元跌至九〇萬元，黃豆已由四四萬元跌至三九萬元。芝蔴已由八二萬元，跌至七七萬元。據有關方面稱：此種現象，如能繼續縱持，固屬有利於民生福利，否則惟有加强增產及大量拋售，然後可以抑平油價。關於前一問題，中信局早已計及，近已由國行張總裁核准鉅款，分別委託第三區油廠公會，向產區採購第二次原料。預計在短期內，日產豆，菜，蔴油各一萬担。關於後一問題，市府業經決定，由中國食油公司速由靑島運生油一萬担來滬，與中植廠維持每日配售。</p>
<p>南市塲負責人分析　最近米價波動原因</p>
<p>食米連日狂漲，威脅民生至鉅。南市米業市塲負責人發表談話稱，本市米價彼動，其原因如下：　公用事業之巨額增價，及其他物價劇烈激盪。　蘇，浙，皖，贛兩湖等省，因受借征影響，報價頻升。　當局在蕪湖一帶照市採購。　湘贛兩省，禁止出口。　糧食營業稅，未邀免征。　少數市民護持幣値，就力購儲。　本市糧商所辦各米，候運未來。我人希望當局在不傷農，不病民的原則下，迅速統籌全盤確切有效辦法，使糧商有所遵循。此外希望各點，擇要列下：　疏導來原，暢通運輸。　蠲免稅捐，獎勵販運。（如一物數征之營業稅不應開征）　恢復農貸，辦理押匯。　拋售公糧，安定人心。　加速配給，言出事隨。</p>
<h3>塲內一片喊賣聲　棉紗布續趨下游　四二支藍鳳比上日小三百萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因當局澈查倉庫及紗廠紗號帳册，人心更怯，且銀根抽緊，浮多散戶斬價出售，各紗喊價下挫。四二支藍鳳最後價喊三千二百五十萬元，繼瀉三百萬元。廿支雙馬步小一百十萬元，十六支光明下挫一百卅萬元，其他粗細各紗，亦均盤跌一百萬至二三百萬元不等。</p>
<p>棉布市况，亦因當局決心抑平物價，己令公會轉飭同業，限期登記，更以隔昨紡雄公司供售十二磅龍頭細布，對申購者照單統配，籌碼充裕。又以行局續有鉅額差入，銀根緊迫，人心虛弱，堪內一片喊賣聲，各布行情均告下游。龍頭細布最後做低至八十二萬元，比上日續瀉八萬元。其他各種細布嗶嘰斜紋等，步降四五萬至七·八萬外不一。</p>
<p>議價不動</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會棉紗議價，昨仍維持不動。廿支紗仍掛一五二〇萬元原價。</p>
<p>現棉續疲</p>
<p>昨日現綿市况，趨勢續疲，交易亦少，買戶乘被抑價，脚地甚軟。靈竇棧交價最高做開四四八萬，較上日續挫四十萬。火機回小五萬至十萬，其餘各檔無甚做開，但用戶納胃淸淡，前途亦軟，成交八百包左右，又二百担送廠價靈竇四五〇萬，棧交價靈實四四二萬至四四八萬。火機三六〇萬至三七三萬，漢粗三七五萬，周浦籽花六七萬五千，小七萬。</p>
<h3>人絲進銳退速　二日間跌落約二千萬　廠經沉寂綢貨亦降低</h3>
<p>人造絲市進銳退亦速，二日間跌落幾達二千萬元，昨日上午一二〇號旭字有光開盤在七千七八百萬元之間，旋因供求失衡，人心虛軟，節節下挫，中午價做四百萬元左右，下午續疲，最後價爲七千二百五十萬元賣出價，迄傍晚人心忽又轉好，喊價逐見抬高約四五百萬元，然無成交。</p>
<p>中信討論分配問題</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局於昨日上午十時起，召集本外埠各絲織業，織帶　，針織業等公會在該局開會討論改善人造絲分配間題，共到十二單位，代表十餘人。中信局何墨林·王子健·楊吉孚·王樹民等，均出席。上午當由各公會代表先行報告各公會近况。縱於下午開始討論各埠各公會實需配額，未獲定論，將於今日上午，織續討論云。</p>
<p>廠經　昨市頗沉寂，上午未聞做開，下午因人絲續跌，人心漸虛，喊價各級約短一二百萬元，C字等級喊七千萬元，還價六千八百萬元朱成交，另担做關七八担，高級六千七百萬至七百五十萬元，干經高另担價在四千八百萬元左右。</p>
<p>綢貨　昨市隨原料而降低，眞絲被而因賣多於買，跌勢仍厲，大誠與華强貨開巿後二千四百萬元有成交，旋即步步下降，迄收市時做隔日期三百萬元，最後又跌至隔日期二百五十萬元，華錦縐昨價喊五萬五千元，殊乏成交。其餘各貨亦均續告疲軟。</p>
<h3>自備外匯物資　處理辦法公布後　各方觀感斑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行經濟硏究處處長冀朝鼎，昨對政府決定自備外匯到滬貨物之處理辦法，發表談話如次：自八月廿一日輸管會發表公告規定，凡本年八月十六日以前已經啓運在途，而尙未取得輸入許可證之貨物，概須限期登記後，於是即發生所謂無許可證自備外匯到埠及啓運貨物之處理問題。現此間題處理辦法，已經十四日行政院政務會議通過。在當前管理貿易外匯之環境下，據個人的看法，此辦法確已面面顧到。考慮週全。但須政府將來配售收購物資時，避免使貨物落入囤戶之手。而工業方面所配售到之原料及器材，能傎正用之於生產，則在此物資缺乏之時，鉅額物資投入市塲，當可使生產與消費雙方交蒙其利。</p>
<p>進出口商表示　對物價有影響</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府決定收購自備外匯進口貨物後，記者特訪進出口業公會理事長張耀章，探詢意見。據稱：「進出口商已就此事交換意見，將來對政府擬有具體表示。個人認爲政府所決定之收購辦法與歷次有關當局對進出口商人之表示，相云太遠。站在政府之產塲，收購辦法有三點利益：　政府因之得掌握大量物資，减少通貨發行。　因有此筆進口物資在手，下期限額分配所需之外匯，得以節省。　在目前收購辦法之下，政府可得重大利潤。但如商人不願資金被凍結三年，而將貨物重行運輸出口時，則在今日之經濟危局下，對物價必有不良之影響。</p>
<h3>實行棉花聯合議價　紡調會決定兩原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會於昨日下午三時，召開第十四次例會，主席劉泗英，報告事項共三點：　近來議價實施及聯合配銷情形。　在棉花各據點市場，實行聯合議價，免使花市波動。　辦理紗布存貨登記辦法。</p>
<p>聞棉花聯合議價，將由紡建民營廠中農銀行花商，四方而合議，原則二點：　保障棉農合法利潤，　勿搶購棉花免使花市作不合理之波動。</p>
<p>六區棉紡公會　協助檢查紗廠</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會，昨下午二時半，擧行第廿七次理事會議，討論議案有：紡調會通知爲檢查本市各紗廠紗號棉紗購銷運儲情形，請派員協辦案，決議出會派員參加。席間對全經會三委員，暨陳部長召集談話經過，交換意見，　希望政府儘量輸入外棉　希望政府對於各項生產條件，盡力協助，　請紡調會繼續實行機動性議價制。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會紗布外銷委會，於昨下午四時半，在國行舉行會議，沈熈瑞主席。討論經過，對紗布外銷易取印棉問題，決議要點：　各廠紗布十分之一，外銷掉取印棉，爲便利外匯之核算計，決請匯豐，花旗，中國三銀行，担任中間保證人。　各廠外銷紗布標準，須經縝密之檢驗。　各廠外銷之紗布，須先經外銷委會核許。爲辦理該項核許事宜，外銷委會特在紡建公司內附設業務處，兼辦核許事宜。　由中央銀行先墊資金一筆，購取印棉，分配各廠紡織紗布，源源外銷易棉。</p>
<h3>華股前巿萎靡臨收反動回漲</h3>

<h3>評中國地理敎科圖</h3>
<p>— 易中</p>
<p>（楊景雄褚紹唐編纂，新中輿地學社出版，三十六年九月初版）</p>
<p>地圖為地理教學上之基本工具，誠已無待贅言，故今日輿地學社對地圖之出版已呈蓬勃氣象，且又因閱圖者程度之不同，故為適用起見，地國之編製遂有適合大學，高中及初中小學之分。</p>
<p>適用於初中及小學之地岡，於目下所見已甚多，但編製完善者極少，不無遺憾。近日筆者見有新中與地學社出版之中小學適用之中國地理教科圖，係楊景雄褚紹唐二氏編纂，籍課餘之暇閱覽一遍，就華者之拙見，深覺斯圖有商確之處甚多。不揣　陋，列述於左:</p>
<p>政區圖上應將全國省轄市儘量繪入，惟現圖上唐山，錦州，鞍山，新竹，台中，彰化，嘉義，屏東諸市付之缺如。</p>
<p>地形圖上之「由粵桂平原至台灣之剖面圖」中之秀姑巒山，是圖誤作透姑巒山。</p>
<p>地形圖上大別山東側，無河道連絡長江及淮河（運河除外），而斯圖上却有一河速絡長江及淮河，不知何意！</p>
<p>修文，貴陽昆明之鋁，海城，蓋平之菱苦土鑛及滑石，均為我國之一大富源，鑛產圖上理應加入，而斯圖付之闕如。</p>
<p>至於交通方面，確實詳明，自亦不易，此團誤點有：</p>
<p>自江蘇之東海入河南，徐隴海鐵道外尚有海鄭公路，自東海經宿遷，徐州，至鄭州，其中宿遷徐州間公路早已完成，且已見全國經濟委員會豫鄂皖贛蘇浙湘七省聯絡公路路綫圖，他圖均增此錢，此圖尚付闕如。</p>
<p>自滬杭鐵道上之硤石有二公路，一北行運絡嘉興長安間公路，一南行連絡滬杭公路，此公路於勝利前完成，且已屢見浙江諸報載，是圖亦缺。</p>

<p>台灣岡上自屏東至枋寮之幾道，今僅通至林邊，並不通至枋寮，見卅五年台灣省行政長官公署交通處編印之台灣交通第一　。</p>

<p>自平漢鐵道上之小　至開封間鐵道付缺，見同上條。</p>
<p>陝西省圖上，安康白河間公路已成，而斯滿却繪為未成錢，誤，見申報各地通訊版，「西北公路路綫圖」。</p>
<p>自天水有一公路西北行經通渭至萃家嶺，此路即萃雙公路之一段，早已完成，且已屢見報章雜誌，他國均有此綫·此圖尚付缺如。</p>

<p>台濫圖上基隆台北間公路除與鐵道平行一綫外，尚有一公路，繞大屯山至台北，此公路他　均有此綫，是　缺，見台灣省行政畏官公署統計室編印之合灣統計地圖·又自合省屏東圖中繪有公路至美和南部，輿台東公路連絡，此公路不知成於何時？其根據亦不單。</p>
<p>台灣圖上自三貂嶺，有一鐵道通至審桐坑，而此圖將該鐵道終點繪於靑桐坑之東之平溪，誤。</p>
<p>除交通而外，我又發現縣治及其他的誤點一併指出，以為此文之結束。</p>
<p>湖北武昌縣巳移治金口，是圖缺。陝西之同官改名鋼川，此圖誤為同川。</p>
<p>浙江原為七十六縣，惟目新設文成縣後，腰改為七十七縣，而此閱附說中仍為七十六縣</p>
<p>浙江東部沿海一帶因風向和海岸平行，故下甬機會較少，如西部遂安年雨達一八二六公厘，建德達一四一六公厘，而沿海之北魚山僅一一五九公厘，可知浙江雨量分佈有自西向東　减之趨勢，絕非附說上所謂「沿海一帶雨量為最盛」。</p>
<p>甘肃省圖上，白龍江於西固附近有一支流日岷河，屬長江水系，而此圖僅繪其上游下游未繪出，且又繪為洮河之支流，誤。詳見李旭旦著白籠江巾游人生地理觀察「地理學報第八卷。</p>
<h3>增訂中國憲法史</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>陳茹玄著　世界書局出版　定價國幣十四元　全書共四五八頁</p>
<p>我在十年之前，搜集資料，參考憲政名著，編篆「中國憲法大綱」就常常參考陳茹玄先生的「中國憲法史」。當我寫「中國憲法大綱」時，以爲到道部著作問世後，我國政治終可以踏入憲政時期了。詎料「中國憲法大戰」在中華書局的廚窗內陳列時，不僅原定於廿六年十一月十二日召開的國民大會，一時沒有舉行的希望，而且整個的中國也已在抗</p>
<p>從此以後，全國朝野所爭取的，是抗戰的勝利，民族的解放，而政治的民主化，反而退居於次要的地位了。政府在抗戰期間，雖也盡極大的努力，務使政治合於民主的當軌，爲　思廣益計，曾設立國民參政會，使人民的意見得以上遠。但是我國政治眞能踏入憲政時期，非要到抗戰勝利之後不可了。因此關於憲政的著作，都為一般讀者所忽視。尤其是陳先生的「中國憲法史」及我的「中國憲法大綱」在滬發行，受到日本憲兵的檢查，視為禁書，不許發售。所以第一版的醫都沒有售馨。</p>
<p>到了抗戰勝利之後，我國政治經過八九年的演變，書內所記載的史實，都有加以增益的必要。我早就想把「中國憲法大綱」加以修改及增訂，重行版行，但因服務新聞界，替好幾家的報館寫社論，幾乎無暇再整理舊著。前天葉秋原兄送來陳先生的增訂中國憲法史」一大册，一方而使我感到慚愧，另一方面又給我一個鼓勵，我應該抽暇整理舊著。</p>
<p>增訂中國憲法史的特色，乃在其最後二章，一為抗戰期問之憲法運動以及各方對於憲草的意見，除了說明抗戰與憲政的關係而外，並提出了一個結束黨治的問題，同時並記載全國各界研究憲草的運動。最後把政治協商會對鈴憲法的主張，也搜集在這一單內。二為憲法之完成及其實施。這一章可以說是最近一年的憲政史，第一節是召開國民大會之最後波折，政治協商會原定於五月五日召開國大，但因各黨先爭名額，後又拒提出名單，乃告延會，至十一月十五日開幕，巾共民盟均未參加。第二節是政協憲法草案，先提交立法院審議，加以修正。陳先生是立法委員，曾親自參加憲草討論，深知政協憲草的優劣，所以他在第三節憲法草案修正案評述中，提出許多可寶貴的意見。尤其是他把正式憲法與政協草案不同各點，列表以明之，最為淸楚。</p>
<p>陳先生在結論中說「吾國之憲法運動，自淸季迄今，四十餘年，至三十六年一月，此舉國矚望之百年大法，始獲完成公佈，爲時之久，用力之多，可謂衡破世界制憲之紀錄。得之甚難，其護之也必周，其行之必力，此吾對於吾國憲政之前途，所以於漫漫長夜之餘，而喜其曙光一錢之將臨也。」要之，陳先生的「中國憲法史」，是值我們一讀的，特地介紹於關心中國憲政之讀者，此書實不可不看，對於暸解中國憲政的實際情形，有莫大的裨益。</p>
<h3>「我的生活」</h3>
<p>— 團尼</p>
<p>著者：蔣經國</p>
<p>出版期：民國三十六年四月</p>
<p>出版處：前鋒出版社</p>
<p>這是一本蔣先生出任第四行政專員時創造建設新贛南三年計劃的具體寫實，也就是在民國三十一年七月四日，決定建設新贛南生死關鍵的第四行政區縣長會議席上的悄形。他集中了贛南所有的人力，物力，財力，訓練大批革命幹部，改善羣眾基本生活，領導人民積極參加抗戰。他舉出歷史中的幾個失敗英雄及其失敗的原因。所以，要求大家拿出忠心來愛國，拿出良心來愛民，掌出熱心來做事，拿出心血來做人，更需要抱着苦幹，硬幹，快幹，實幹的決心，有步驟，有計劃，有意義，有目的站在人民陣錢上，共同建設新贛南。過去一年半來所他領導推行的新政，已有卓越的成績，然而離開三年計劃的理想尚遠，蔣先生更勉勵大家加倍努力，以期完成保衛新贛南的重任。</p>
<p>過去贛南什麽都是落後腐敗的，有些村莊上的老百姓，竟把土匪當作正當作業，及把農作當副業，殺人放火賭錢搶刦吸毒，成了某些百姓的日常生活。有些地方不和外界往來，讀書人絕少，小學一畢業，就可坐起轎子來做紳士。有留着辮子的男人，穿淸代古裝的女子。這些都表明當地百姓的極端守舊性。政府又不想法改革，積沿成了普遍的習慣，再到不能收拾。既然道些車都是人做出來的，也只有用人的新力量來做移風易俗的工作。蔣先生是最樂於鐵向艱鉅的地方去鬥爭的，畢竟使今日的新贛南，成為全國的示範。</p>
<p>全書共八十五頁，約四萬餘字，都是第四行政區行政會議的具體寫竇，可分爲三章：第一章　我所希　的新中國，一，從　縣醫學研究所的附屬醫院內病床上的一個楊姓老人，描述其施診後神速地恢復了健康，及周圍環境的合乎現想，象微出美麗的遠景，二，蔣先生報告神聖抗戰的起因與必勝的後果，其次，詳析怎建建設新　南，蔣先生認為第一步要完成地方目治，要用大公無私的態度去幹。因為，國家有了幸福時，人民才能亨受幸福，三，說明偉大的新時代要有新的幹部用新的作風來完成新的任務。第二章:革命工作與革命幹部，一，說明各方面的困難，並要大家克服困難，抱定決心來推行新政，同時選而大家引用新的好的能幹的革命幹部，二，分析好的幹部，必需採取民意，解除民苦，接受批評，還要運用組織來訓練他人，才稱得起革命工作的戰土，三，要求大家從今天起慶開新任務，完成還個計劃，第三章：新事業，新仟務，由各縣長工作報告後，蔣先生更指示九點施政方針，其次，又檢討了專員公署和縣府雙方的缺點，希望大家勇於改過，又指出四個內在危機，需要澈底革除。末了，蔣先生提出了這次的會議的中心題，希認大家展開熟烈的研討，還次會讓實有決定建設新　南的成敗性。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利的兩年以來，烽火未曾熄滅，貧困未曾解脫，人民心理反而形成散漫現象，敵偽遺風朱稍减退，前途是值得可　的，我們每個國人嬰想挽救國運，只有模効蔣先生的革命生活的確，「事在人為」做壞的是人，做好的也是人，凡事祇有憑決心，恒心，進取心，沒有做不好的道理。</p>
<h3>介紹「湖濱秋色」</h3>
<p>— 林郁文</p>
<p>作者：王平陵</p>
<p>出版：商務印書館</p>
<p>定價：國幣四元</p>
<p>戰時曾有過一番熟鬧的文藝塲面，到今天還是滿目荒蕪的廢墟，這自然是由於戰後喘息未定，內亂頻仍，逼使大家的生活陷於困境，連帶地損書了作家們的寫作情趣的緣故。所以，在出版界尚沒有比較像樣的作品，填塞文壇的空虛，滿足讀者的濁想。</p>
<p>很幸運地於兩年後的今天，我讀到一部工力充實的創作集——「湖濱秋色」。因為還册子是出於一位從事文藝逾二十年的老作家工平陵氏之手，彷彿他之把作品提高到「湖演秋色」這樣的水準，是應該的，在文壇上不算是一件驚天動地的大事</p>
<p>「湖濱秋色」內刊一個中篇，八個精心結撰的短篇。中有選取歷史的題材，適切地反映現實的作品：如「國士無雙」，就是最熟悉的蕭何追韓信的故事，作者把劉項爭幾時的塲景，寫得有聲有色，付予新的看法，刻劃一羣為沛公出過力拼過命的壯丁，在　秦既已覆滅，都不願意再參加劉項的內訌，加東老百姓的痛苦。這意發是相當深刻的。「新亭淚」是採用晋元帝號召社會賢達，抗戰建國的史實。當時那些英雄豪傑一片忠勇舊發的熱腸，和衷共濟的眞忱，都活現在紙上，如實地寫出當時的情景，深深地給今天政治舞台上的人物一個教育性的對照。</p>
<p>選用現代史的題材有三篇：「休矣！十二時！」是描寫東洋希脫勒——中野正剛的沒落。這傢伙幸而沒有黨握到日本的政權，要不然，今天的地理，將來的歷史，一定要全盤改觀。作者在這一個矩篇中，為日寇找到了慘敗的至因，給黜武的野心家攝下悽慘的拷貝。「陸園明月夜」及「做戲」兩篇，寫盡了奸偽偷生於日寇鐵蹄下的可憐史，足使今後存心背叛民族利益的匪徒們捏一把冷汗。</p>
<p>作為代表醫各的湖濱秋色，故事發生在戰時的秋天西湖演，那些無恥的奸偽，異想天開，要紏集無數純潔無邪的孩子們，假裝排隊歡迎的模樣，攝成各種鏡頭，宣示世界，藉以證明敵寇是「愛民如子」的軍隊。他們眞沒有想到下一代的孩子們已和自己劃了一個時代。孩子們遺樣號呼：「我們是中國人，不是漢奸的兒子呵！」奸偽們千方百計要把自己的兒子作為討好主子的工具，始終不能如願，這一羣孩子們終於在夕陽煊染的湖濱，照得秋草如血，湖光通紅，做了中華民族的犧牲祭。作者懷抱着極度虔敬的心情，醮血和淚，一華不苟，為殉難的孩子們，立下一塊光榮的墓碑，使我們能依稀想象當年壯烈的慘劇，無疑的是盡了一個文藝工作者所應盡的責任了！</p>
<p>作者又以非常的惆忱，寄同情於窮苦無告，不變節操的亂離中的作家們，像是現身說法似的，寫下了「專慶的一角」。及「進城」兩篇成功的作品。我一口氣讀完，內心感到沉重的壓迫。他運用間熟的技術，為續者繪出兩副盡，一邊在埋頭苦幹，一邊在荒淫無恥，一邊是天堂，一邊是地獄；但住在天堂裹的，反是無惡不作的魔鬼，而被冷酷的現實，打入十八層地獄裹的倒是殉道的聖者。</p>
<p>中篇期特，有些像鄧鐵梅，苗可秀在東北組識義勇軍的故事；但不全是，作者已加以融化，滲入新的材料。全篇分六章，在這義，有着一羣無國籍的遺民，情願把他們自己的血液·陶　獨立自由的新國魂，他們雖然在舉虜者的壓抑下，先後扑倒；但他們的不朽的精靈，卻是中國勝利復與的　徽。</p>
<p>總之，在這一例册子中，作者已運用精練圓熟，深人淺出的藝術手腕，及深邊細緻的思慮，寫下了八年來軍大的歷史事件，可供史家的考證，給當代與從代的人徘徊觀摩，俯仰憑弔。同時，也已把八年來的大塲面，可歌可泣的生活型，以及那些令人憎恨的醜舉的嘴險，攝入鏡頭，繪形繪色，有血有肉，放映在讀者之前了。</p>

<h3>Liaoxi National Army Convenes in Jinzhou, Suburbs of Luoyang Completely Cleared; Weishi, Yucheng, and Changge All Reported Recovered</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 15th] Fu Zuoyi's cavalry and other divisions have achieved great success galloping near Jinxi. Jinxi has been recovered. On the 15th, the navy, army, and air force cooperated to attack the Nan Gaoqiao Station in Jinzhou, defeating the bandits' obstruction there and arriving in Jinzhou to join forces with the national army stationed there. It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi will fly to Jinzhou on the 16th to give instructions to his troops, and then fly back to Pan. He may stay in Shenyang for a longer period. A radio station is currently being set up in Shenyang to facilitate communication with Zhangjiakou. It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi paid respects to Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, and other Northeast veterans on the 15th, and attended a banquet hosted by Ma Zhanshan in the afternoon, where they discussed the past in the Northwest and the present in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The battlefield between Tieling and Kaiyuan is now quiet.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 15th] After the Northeast National Army switched from defense to offense, it achieved successive victories in Suizhong, Yingkou, and Heishan. The National Army heading south from Siping is expected to join forces with the Tieling National Army at Shantou Fort south of Zhonggu. It is generally believed that the bandits' so-called offensive, even if it cannot be described as disintegration, is at the end of its strength. There have been no major battles around Changchun recently. Although small groups of communists occasionally harass the area, they are often defeated and flee in disarray when the National Army launches attacks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] The area between Shenyang and Siping will soon be completely cleared. Currently, there are no traces of bandits within 30 li of the railway line between Tieling and Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, announced at a press conference today that the initial offensive of the Northeast communists had been repelled, and whether they could re-invade the periphery of Shenyang was doubtful. [Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 15th] Military news: The magistrate of Weishi County led the self-defense force, cooperating with a part of the National Army, and recovered the county seat at about 2:00 AM this morning. The county government has returned to the city to work. About 5,000 bandits near Tongxu fled eastward successively from 6:00 PM to 12:00 PM yesterday. There are no traces of bandits within 80 li around Kaifeng. The elite National Army reinforcements to Luoyang arrived in Luoyang yesterday and joined forces with the defending army there. The situation in Luoyang is becoming more stable.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 15th] On the night of the 11th, the communists sneaked into Xiguan and the vicinity of Zhougong Temple in Luoyang, engaging in fierce battles with our defending army all night. Later, an elite unit of our army rushed to the scene and, together with the Luoyang garrison, fought a bloody battle for three days and nights, annihilating more than 4,000 bandits and killing one brigadier general of the 11th Brigade of the bandits. Furthermore, the entire 32nd Regiment of the brigade was wiped out, and the regimental commander, Wang Qiwu, was also killed. Chen Geng's bandit troops were completely routed. Currently, there are no traces of bandits in the suburbs of Luoyang. The National Army is pursuing and attacking various strongholds in the periphery. Order in the urban area is as usual. The Luoyang Power Plant resumed power supply on the evening of the 14th, restoring light.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 15th] There are no traces of bandits in the counties of Weishi, Yucheng, and Changge.</p>
<p>Map of the Vicinity of Luoyang</p>
<h3>Anhui-Jiangsu Border Bandits Eyeing Sui; National Army Enters Mengcheng and Sweeps Westward; Communist Bandits Fiercely Attack Anqiu Without Success</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 15th] An elite unit of the National Army entered Mengcheng on the 13th and continued to advance westward on the 14th. The battle of Sui Ning (southeast of Xuzhou) is fierce. Chen's bandits attempted to cut off the Xuzhou-Huaiyin transportation line. On the 12th, he deployed more than 10,000 bandits from his Third Column, captured Da Li Ji (southwest of Sui Ning), and besieged Sui Ning County.

<h3>Passengers Entering and Leaving the Country; Allowed to Carry a Limited Amount of Legal Tender</h3>

<h3>Wei Ambassador's Report Delayed and Not Published; Washington Figures Speculate</h3>
<p>Detailed Recommendations on Steps to Aid China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] General Wedemeyer's report on China is still a diplomatic mystery here. Mr. Wei submitted a formal report to President Truman and Secretary Marshall a month ago, but the contents have not been detailed so far. Many people are gradually realizing that the report may never be published. According to unconfirmed rumors, it was Secretary Marshall who shelved the report. As for the reason for shelving it, no one dares to speculate. An observer believes that Wei Demeyer has suggested detailed steps for material and financial and technical assistance. Allen, a Washington reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance, said in his article today that General Wei Demeyer's report has been distributed in seven copies. Recipients of the report include President Truman, Acting Secretary of State Lovett, Secretary of State Marshall, and the Department of Finance, the Army and Navy. Allen said that this lengthy report contains detailed suggestions on China and how China fits into its international position, but it does not detail the shortcomings of the Chinese government. The main part of the report is an analysis of the economic, political, military and social situation in China. One of the suggestions is that if the United States provides China with assistance again, the assistance should be supervised by the United States, including the actual distribution work. Allen also said that the Chinese government is aware of the content of Wei's report. According to a well-informed official, there may be three reasons for maintaining silence on the report: The report involves many government agencies, and it must be considered and acted upon after many days. The report's emphasis on a global aid plan prevents the State Department from coordinating, as the State Department is currently working hard to make Marshall's aid plan for Europe a reality. The Truman administration is afraid that if aid to China becomes a general public discussion topic at this time, it may have an adverse effect on the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Tells the Truth; Recalls the Failures of the Yalta Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Former Secretary of State Byrnes announced in his memoirs, "Speaking Frankly," that if the Soviet Union had made the opposite decision and not participated in the war when the Soviet Union fulfilled the conditions to participate in the war against Japan, he would have been happy. "Although Japan insisted on refusing to surrender unconditionally, I believed at the time that the atomic bomb could succeed and force Japan to surrender. When the Red Army entered the Northeast, I was worried about the future. Before they withdrew, my worries came true." Byrnes said that the military situation was completely different when the United States obtained the Soviet Union's promise at the Yalta Conference than when Lu Lian participated in the war. President Roosevelt and his military leaders at the time were eager for the Soviet Union to join the war, and no one could foresee the difficulties encountered after the Yalta Conference. Byrnes said that drafting the Japanese peace treaty would not be very difficult, but the issue of compensation would be a major problem. The Soviet Union insisted that the industrial equipment removed from the Northeast by the Red Army should be considered war trophies and not included in the compensation.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Mission of the Academia Sinica</h3>
<p>The Academia Sinica convened an evaluation council in the capital yesterday. According to reports, the main task of this meeting was to review candidates for academicians, so that after the election is proposed next year, the entire research system will be completed. It is heard that Weng Wenhao, Hu Xiansu, and others successively expressed their opinions at the meeting, calling on society and the government to pay attention to science. We cannot remain silent about the convening of the evaluation council of the nation's highest academic research institution at a time of national crisis and reconstruction.</p>
<p>The Academia Sinica is the highest academic research institution in the country. Since it is called research, to put it bluntly, it naturally involves splitting hairs. We should promote this kind of specialized research in order to catch up with others. However, we believe that it is also necessary to supplement it.</p>
<p>First, the Academia Sinica is not a private research institution, but a national research institution that uses the national treasury and is directly under the National Government. Therefore, all research plans should be based on the standpoint of the nation and the nation, and should be in line with the current national policy, and should not only listen to one's own or private preferences. This is the case with Soviet national institutions, and it is largely the case with research institutions in Britain and the United States that are maintained by the national treasury. Although the Academia Sinica is not a research institution established entirely based on the needs of national defense, its planned and ongoing research should always be in line with national policy.</p>
<p>Second, specialized research is certainly important, but the popularization of specialized academics in China today is perhaps no less important than specialized research. To this day, the textbooks of some domestic universities still have to select original Western texts, which fully shows that Chinese academics are not yet mature and cannot even talk about independence; even in the fields of Chinese history and philosophy, the situation is still unavoidable. It is heard that the pseudo-Academia Sinica established by the communist bandits is compiling and printing a general history of China based on so-called Marxism-Leninism. Why can't the Academia Sinica of the Republic of China compile a general history of China based on the Three Principles of the People in accordance with the Constitution? Since its establishment, the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica has indeed made great contributions in the field of specialized research, but it seems that it is still insufficient in terms of popularizing academics, especially in how to cooperate with our national policy. As for general scientific research, it should also be carried out in response to China's most urgent needs, so as not to betray the expectations of the country and the people for the Academia Sinica, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Speaking of the election of academicians of the Academia Sinica, this is still an innovation in China. The term "academician" seems to be based on the system of members of the Royal Society of England and the French "Académie". In France and England, members of these two institutions enjoy high prestige. An Englishman who adds the abbreviation F.R.S. after his name seems to add supreme glory. However, this is a foreign system. They have taken root in foreign countries, buried in their soil, and become part of their cultural heritage. We transplanted this system, and we must also root it deeply in our soil so that it can become so. Therefore, we should be extra cautious in the election of academicians, and strive to ensure that the elected persons do not give people the feeling of being incompetent.</p>
<p>As for calling on the government and society to pay attention to science, we believe that the government and society should pay attention to science, and those engaged in science should especially know how to respect themselves; only by respecting themselves can others respect them. Today, how many people are loyal to science, enduring all kinds of difficulties and tribulations without leaving their posts. This spirit is worthy of universal admiration! However, there are also many people who study science or have been baptized by science who have left their posts and engaged in other things that can increase their power and wealth. They have abandoned science and left their inherent positions. This is certainly a great loss to the country, and they themselves may not feel pain. If Chinese scientists can completely liberate themselves from the traditional ideas of scholar-officials and no longer have the idea of "excelling in learning and then becoming an official," then scientists in China will surely have their supreme glory. We are currently in this transitional period of change, everything is changing, and we must also join the senior scholars of general scientific research in calling on the government and society to pay attention to science!</p>
<h3>World Young Women's Christian Association Conference</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) The foreign guest reception center is located on the shore of West Lake, at the foot of Shishuta, facing the lake and backing the mountain, with a very beautiful environment. The conference venue is located in the conference hall of the foreign guest reception center. The venue is decorated simply and solemnly. The four walls are decorated with statistical comparison tables of work and photos of group activities and life. A rostrum is set up in the center, covered with white table cloth, and a large vase of osmanthus flowers is placed on the rostrum. The osmanthus flowers in the garden outside the venue are in full bloom, and a gust of wind blows, filling the room with fragrance. The conference chairman, Miss van Eyns, sits in the center, with Mrs. Ling Xianyang and Secretary-General Wu Simo sitting beside her. The chairs for the representatives are arranged in a semi-circle. At the beginning of the conference, there is a solemn and solemn spiritual practice program. All the representatives read the Bible, sang hymns together, and prayed in unison. The chairman then called the roll according to the list of representatives. There are more than 130 people, including planned representatives, attending representatives, and conference staff. After the roll call, Mrs. Ling Dayang, on behalf of the Chinese Young Women's Christian Association, presented a bright red large wooden fish. Mrs. Ling explained that the wooden fish is a local product of Hangzhou, which can be used as a permanent souvenir of the World Young Women's Christian Association Conference held in China. Chairman Van Eyns stood up to accept it. Since then, whenever attention is distracted in the venue, or a motion needs to be put to a vote, the chairman must strike the wooden fish, which becomes an important tool for controlling the atmosphere of the venue. Then, Miss Wu Simo, Secretary-General of the conference, read congratulatory telegrams sent by women's groups from all over the world, totaling more than 30. Several of them came from the Japanese Young Women's Christian Association, recounting that they were very happy to learn that the World Young Women's Christian Association Conference was opening in Hangzhou, and that their regret and frustration at not being able to participate due to environmental constraints were indescribable. According to reports, the Japanese representatives were unable to attend due to the opposition of the Far East Control Commission. In addition, there was one German representative at the conference, but Mr. Le had an understanding with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country that he could not express any opinions to the outside world.</p>

<h3>Contents of Speeches by Zhu Jiahua and Others</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua said in his opening remarks: In the past year, the academic atmosphere has become increasingly strong. The development of domestic education and international cultural cooperation all require this highest research institution to enrich its equipment and strengthen its work. However, the current difficulties are even greater than during the Anti-Japanese War. The Academia Sinica is now trying to gradually concentrate the research institutes scattered in various places in the capital in order to maintain its integrity. The important significance of this evaluation council is to start to complete a rigorous research system, first determine a list of candidates for academicians from the nominations from all parties, so that elections can be held in the spring of next year to enrich the foundation of the Academia Sinica, start work, and catch up with Western academic civilization. Then, Mr. Wu Dingchang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, conveyed the greetings and encouragement of President Chiang. Mr. Li Shizeng, Supervisory Committee member of the Central Committee, congratulated the meeting on its success. Mr. Li also elaborated that the Kuomintang has attached importance to academics since the beginning of the revolution. After the success of the Northern Expedition in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Central Political Conference held a meeting in Dingjia Garden, which led to the establishment of the principles of the Beijing, Ping, and Zhejiang Research Institutes. Later, the Nanjing Research Institute, under the leadership of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, became increasingly developed and became today's Academia Sinica. The Beiping Research Institute, which he founded, still stands tall. He hopes that the two can cooperate closely and hold a joint conference at an appropriate time and place. During the speeches of the guests, Mr. Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, hoped that the Academia Sinica could discover the highest principles in the field of metaphysics to guide all cultural academics. Vice President Wang Yunwu, in addition to congratulating the meeting on its success on behalf of President Zhang, also said: He very much agreed with President Hu Shi's recent advocacy of academic independence, "believing that the quality of overseas students should be strictly examined, the number should be reduced, the mentality of gold-plating should be eliminated, and the foreign exchange saved each year can reach 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan, which can be used to enrich domestic universities, which is very worthwhile. Then, Hu Shi, representing the council members, replied that the Academician Election Committee had held four meetings and completed the preliminary review procedures for the 510 people proposed by various universities, colleges, research associations, and government agencies. After this review committee decides on the list of candidates and the government announces it in April to solicit opinions from people across the country, it will be selected at the fifth meeting in the spring of next year. At that time, the academic system can be completed, and the significance is very great. Mr. Hu also discussed that overseas students can be divided into two categories, one is the despicable gold-plating, and the other is the true academic researchers. The academic independence he recently advocated focuses on making universities research institutions, making domestic university degrees more honorable and employable than foreign doctorates. He also pointed out that the current government does not trust academic institutions too much and requires that the power to award degrees be completely handed over to universities, so as to avoid official complications and insult academic dignity. Weng Wenhao believes that as heaven changes, so does the Tao. Science progresses extremely fast, and the country is sorry for talents in terms of equipment and treatment, and should send them to foreign countries for research. Hu Xiansu believes that the government should pay attention to the resolution passed by the Supreme National Defense Council last year to use 1% of all national tax revenue as a special fund for science and realize it as soon as possible to strengthen national defense scientific research. After that, Mr. Li Shizeng conveyed Mr. Wu Zhihui's opinion on studying abroad, saying that studying abroad should be developed in a foreign country and does not necessarily cost too much money. Gold-plating is certainly unnecessary, but it is important to absorb the Western cultural spirit through studying abroad.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Public Trial of Jin Bihui</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Today, the trial was originally scheduled to start at 3:00 pm. By noon, the crowds holding hearing permits had already crowded around the temporary court in the back garden of the High Court, totaling more than 2,000 people. The trees around were also full of spectators. The court was set up in a small pavilion, surrounded by sturdy fir poles. Before the trial began, order could be maintained. When Jin Bihui was mentioned, the order was greatly disrupted. Jin was trapped in the car in the crowd for half an hour before being forcibly led to the court by military police. In the midst of the uproar, the question and answer between the Presiding Judge Wu Shenghan and Jin had to be conveyed loudly by the court. The court clerk was also unable to record everything. Then, the fir poles were broken by the crowd, and everyone rushed forward. Reporters and photographers from the China Electric Third Factory were squeezed out. Jin's defense lawyers, Li Yichen, Li Cao, and Ding Zuoshao, were also isolated. Many people were injured in the crowd. The court case was almost lifted up. Although there were many military police, they were helpless. Jin wore a green woolen suit and trousers, a white wool sweater, and shiny short hair. He looked around at the audience with a smile, seemingly very interested. Jin had a plan in mind, and his answers were calm and natural. Finally, at 4:00 pm, in extreme chaos, the court announced the suspension of the trial. Jin was escorted into a car by bailiffs in the midst of the crowd and taken back to the prison.</p>
<p>Presiding Judge's Remarks</p>
<p>Afterwards, Presiding Judge Wu told reporters the main points of today's questions and answers. According to him, Jin mostly evaded answering. However, in her confession that she had asked Wang Jingwei on behalf of the Japanese side whether he had contact with President Chiang when Wang Jingwei visited Japan, some evidence of espionage was also obtained. Mr. Wu said: Jin is the daughter of Prince Su. She was adopted as an adopted daughter by the Japanese Kawashima Naniwa when she was three years old. She received education from the Japanese imperial family from an early age and was rich in Bushido thought. Naniwa was an advisor to the Qing court and had close personal relationships with Prince Su and others. He advocated Sino-Japanese friendship and named Jin Kawashima Yoshiko. At the same time, he instilled in Yoshiko the idea of Sino-Japanese friendship. Yoshiko knew that she was the descendant of a Manchu Qing prince, so she deliberately restored the Manchu Qing. Jin claimed that she lived in Shanghai for several months when she was sixteen. Later, her brother Jin Bidong took her to Changchun. When Puyi formed the puppet Manchukuo, the puppet Manchukuo formed the "Dingguo Army" in Beipiao, wanting to incorporate miscellaneous troops. Jin participated in the independence of Changbai Mountain. Later, it was resolved by Tada Shun, and Jin returned to Changchun and lived around Tada. Later, she arrived in Ping. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese side did take her back to the country, but the reason could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>Jin's Confession</p>
<p>What was asked in court today was about the establishment of the "Dingguo Army" since the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, until her inducing Ma Zhanshan and Li Du to be attached to "Manchukuo." Jin completely denied the unfavorable points. Jin admitted that the Japanese side had ordered her to form the "North China Self-Defense Army" and appointed herself as the commander-in-chief. Although she was granted a seal, she did not take office. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, when Wang Jingwei visited Japan, she met with Wang Jingwei together with Touyama Mitsuru and asked Wang whether he had contact with President Chiang? Wang replied, "Let's talk about it later." Jin reported to the Japanese side that "there was no contact." Jin denied that she had conspired with Honjo, Itagaki, and others to launch the September 18th Incident. She admitted that she had served as Konoe's secretary, had contact with Mrs. Tojo, and had close relationships with Tada Shun and Matsuoka Yosuke. She admitted that she had been recuperating in Tianjin in the 30th year of the Republic of China, but she evaded mentioning what kind of injury it was. In addition, in Jin's private letters, it was found that she often referred to herself as "this commander" or signed "Kawashima Little Prince" in her letters to others. In the letters to Jin from Jin's friends, it was found that they advised her to be more active or commented that her men's clothing was not suitable for her own work. In addition, there was also a novel about Jin's espionage activities, "The Beautiful Woman in Men's Clothing."</p>

<h3>First Inspection of Yantai (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>The Qishan Church in the Yantai city area rang its bells this Sunday for the first time in two years. I, the reporter, arrived on the fifth day after the recapture. American sailors arrived even earlier than we did; an American cruiser was anchored outside Yantai harbor. According to Mayor Ding Futing, there were one thousand communist guerilla fighters hiding in the city, carrying over four hundred short guns. The police haven't yet returned to their posts; the few local police he brought from Qingdao all scattered to their homes to visit their families as soon as they arrived in Yantai. Shops are gradually opening their doors, but there is no merchandise. Many once-bustling areas are now very deserted at night. Jinde Street and Dama Road, which specialized in export trade, are almost dead streets compared to before the war; some buildings have even closed down. A curfew is in effect at 10 PM, but by 7 PM, except for soldiers, the streets are deserted. This tense and uneasy atmosphere will hopefully gradually disappear soon. Yantai currently has a population of around 170,000 to 180,000, which is vastly different from Laiyang, another large city in Jiaodong recently recovered by the Nationalists. Laiyang only has 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Supplies Long Gone, Landmines Everywhere</p>
<p>Various signs indicate that the communist retreat was prepared at least a month in advance. This is the most noteworthy point. According to the people, for the past month, at least several hundred carts of supplies were transported out of the city every day, sometimes reaching over a thousand carts at once. The city government dug up light bulbs and tin, buried in the ground in the mountains forty miles away (these are the easiest things to break). Naturally, there were countless other items still in the ground. The Nationalist troops continuously dug things out of the ground as they advanced from Laiyang, including relief supplies (clothing, medicine, etc.) and ammunition. Thousands of rounds of Japanese heavy artillery shells were destroyed on the spot, while the relief supplies became "spoils of war".</p>
<p>When I arrived, landmines were still going off in the city. The communists had planted hundreds of mines, mostly Japanese heavy mines, near the customs house, on the breakwater, and in three locations within the city government. Almost every house, safe, and area that hadn't been checked by combat engineers was viewed with apprehension, marked with warning signs saying "Danger: Landmines". However, there was only one mine detector, making it impossible to keep up with the work.</p>
<p>So far, no one has been able to produce concrete "evidence" to indicate that the Soviet Union provided military aid to Yantai from Dalian. However, the people can remember three Soviet transport ships arriving in Yantai harbor from Dalian, one after another. Besides railroad tracks, it is unknown what other supplies were brought in, and railroad tracks are not easy to pack and conceal. It is estimated that these tracks could be used to make quite a few short guns, which any ordinary factory could do. As for what was transported back to Dalian, it was grain. However, the three ships could not have carried more than 20,000 tons at most, while the transportation by sailboats and small steamers is difficult for anyone to estimate. Even several days after the Nationalists retook Yantai, "refugees" were still arriving by sailboat from Dalian. Even the smallest sampan on the Huangpu River could sail on the Bohai Sea, traveling between Northeast China and Shandong. I saw that the local people handled them very skillfully. Dalian Daily used to arrive in Yantai regularly, but it is no longer available now.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Money Worth Less Than Fabric Trimmings</p>
<p>The most sudden loss for the people was the worthless "North Sea Currency", which completely froze exchange relationships and financial activity. Silver dollars and copper coins became the main currency (they originally had market prices). The military used legal tender, and within three days, the exchange rate of one hundred yuan for ten copper coins became fixed, and 30,000 yuan of legal tender for one silver dollar. In the Jiaodong area, "North Sea Currency" depreciated from 25 yuan of legal tender to one yuan, until it became completely worthless. On the first day that Yantai became a legal tender city, some soldiers bought a pair of leather shoes for 15,000 yuan. Within 24 hours, the price jumped geometrically three times, and then increased arithmetically. There are two possible reasons: one is ignorance of the true value of legal tender; the other is the desire to obtain new currency. Even though goods were scarce, due to the latter reason, prices were still very low (compared to Qingdao and Shanghai). Many women who appeared to be middle class or above were selling goods on the street. They desperately needed legal tender to buy food. They took out clothing and items they had hidden for many years and sold them on the street to exchange for a pitiful amount of legal tender, but it was very useful to them at the moment. Anyone with a conscience would feel that some things were simply being plundered. For example, famous lace, which had not been exported for many years, was now cheaper than local cloth in Shanghai (comparing by size).</p>
<p>Military Supply Ships Come and Go, People Stare</p>
<p>I arrived in Yantai on the Zhongtai cargo ship. Besides warships, this was the first merchant ship, but it was acting as a military supply ship, carrying 10,000 bags of military flour, as well as other passengers. The people gathered at the dock, watching the ship enter the harbor. The people always stared at this and that, burying their impressions and opinions deep in their hearts. A group of officers disembarked empty-handed, accompanied by their female relatives. They stared as well. When the military supply ship sailed back to Qingdao on the 12th, pianos, sofas, furniture, etc. were taken out of the harbor along with it. The people also stared. Some things had already been buried in the ground, while others were leaving before their eyes, both with unknown destinations. The "spoils of war" from Yantai were nothing more than these things. If one wanted to find a document or newspaper, or some good books, it was impossible. My efforts were equal to zero.</p>
<p>However, the British Consulate's archives were completely intact. It wasn't that they were well hidden, but that they hadn't been disturbed in the past. American Consul Xie Weizhi and British Acting Consul Ikeff arrived just as quickly as Mayor Ding Futing. They arrived on the Omei, the ship carrying Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing. There were less than 20 foreigners in Yantai, of French, Italian, British, and Greek nationalities. All were as poor as "Bi San", but compared to Chinese, their standard of living was still above average. When talking about the past situation, they were unwilling to express any opinions, mainly focusing on restoring their businesses. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Slim Hope for Convening Special Session of Congress; US Revises European Aid Procedures; Emergency Aid Extended to End of Next Summer</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] After studying the attitude of Congress and the possibility of emergency measures, the Truman Cabinet has revised the timetable for foreign aid. Although government officials insisted that no decision has been made, they stated that plans to cancel the special session of Congress in early December are under consideration. The temporary aid program will be extended to the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 1948, and the Marshall Plan will begin immediately thereafter. This new plan depends on two points being clarified: 1. Can Congress make a definite commitment to take swift and appropriate action on the temporary aid program when it reconvenes in early January next year? 2. Can the necessary funds for temporary aid be obtained without Congressional approval? The initial participation of the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation in yesterday's key White House meeting suggests that funds for temporary aid can be obtained without Congress. Since the Export-Import Bank has already allowed France to use $90 million of loans originally intended for construction projects to pay for essential goods, it is possible to use the Bank's $800 million capital, or at least a portion of it, for emergency aid to France and Italy. US government officials stated that abandoning the plan to convene a special session of Congress is causing displeasure for both the government and Congress. Many officials believe that if Congress can be kept in a calm state and convinced to approve appropriate emergency funding for aid in the first six months of 1948, and then review the comprehensive long-term reconstruction plan for Europe, there will be a greater hope of successfully passing the aid plan through Congress. It is reported that Sir Franks, Chairman of the European Economic Cooperation Committee of 16 nations, informally discussed the previous plan of the US government when he visited US Undersecretary of State Lovett and Clayton yesterday. At the same time, the situation in France and Italy has improved. In addition to obtaining the Export-Import Bank's approval to use $90 million in loans, France can also receive approximately $90 million in value of gold looted by the Nazis, and approximately $36 million in value of gold looted by Japan. In addition, the compensation of approximately $50 million that the US gives to France because of the US military's presence in France is also being negotiated in Paris. Italy is expected to receive gold worth approximately $30 million from the Nazi-looted gold.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The chances of convening a special session of the US Congress are decreasing daily. Congressional sources report that President Truman has not obtained guarantees from the Republican side to limit the meeting to discussing the $580 million foreign aid bill. It is claimed that Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reported to government leaders that he believes it is inevitable to deal with the European economic crisis in a "package" manner. Supporters of the government believe that Vandenberg's words are intended to merge the long-term Marshall reconstruction plan with Truman's request for an emergency bill to help France, Italy, and Austria get through the winter. Democratic senators privately stated that this move would force them to support the European reconstruction plan, even though the exact amount required by the plan has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Arab League Resolves to Impose Economic Blockade on Jews; Over a Hundred Chiefs Determined to Defend the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 15th Broadcast - Beirut News, Arab countries continued to meet today, during which they unanimously voted to close their borders and intensify the boycott of the entry of Jewish goods as part of the anti-Jewish movement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 14th] The Arab world is filled with war clouds. According to news from the capitals of various Arab countries: - The Arab government in exile in Bhaghdadi is being formed, possibly led by Grand Mufti al-Husseini; - All Arab countries have formed a joint general staff; - Seven Arab countries are cooperating militarily, such as Syria being responsible for cavalry, Transjordan being responsible for mechanized forces, Lebanon being responsible for infantry, Saudi Arabia being responsible for the air force, and Egypt and Iraq being responsible for artillery and medical supplies.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beirut, 14th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam stated today that the Arab countries' discussions on Palestine have ended. These discussions were held in Damascus, the capital of Syria, Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, and Amman, the capital of Transjordan. Yesterday, a round table meeting was held in the palace of King Abdullah of Transjordan, and a complete agreement has been reached on all points. According to sources here, King Abdullah has agreed to abandon his Greater Syria plan, at least temporarily, to avoid hindering the Arab League's unified position on the Palestine issue. The selection of the Arab military commander-in-chief is still pending.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 15th] According to credible sources, over a hundred chiefs in the Beersheba district held a meeting in the desert and sent a telegram to the exiled Islamic Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in Cairo, stating, "We support Your Excellency in defending the country." The chiefs decided to support the Arab Higher Committee's policy of "Defending Palestine" and decided to establish a "National Guard".</p>
<h3>Syrian Representative Opposes Formation of International Police Force; US Wary of Soviet Influence Expansion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] Syrian Representative Zeineddine warned today that the UN-proposed Palestinian police force will inevitably cause bloodshed, and if Syria agrees to it, it would be tantamount to inviting war and destruction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The Soviet Union's support for the partition of Palestine in UN organizations has raised the issue of Soviet troops being stationed in the eastern Mediterranean for the first time. When US Representative Johnson explained the US's attitude in the UN General Assembly's Palestine Special Committee last Saturday, he stated that in order to maintain law and order during the transition period, special police forces need to be organized by recruiting volunteers from the United Nations. If the Soviet Union agrees to partition in principle and then expresses its willingness to help implement this solution, then it is expected that Soviet citizens will be very enthusiastic about serving as volunteer police officers.</p>
<h3>Trusteeship Committee Passes Indian Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] Despite strenuous opposition from colonial powers and the United States, the UN Trusteeship Committee today passed a resolution favoring the view that the trusteeship system is a shortcut to promoting the independence of colonies worldwide, with 25 votes in favor, 23 against, and 3 abstentions. This resolution was proposed by India.</p>
<h3>French Strike Wave Expands, Government Discusses Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] Under the instigation of the Communist Party, the strike by Paris transport workers has lasted for two days. The French Cabinet held an urgent meeting on the 15th to discuss countermeasures. Prime Minister Ramadier reported on the seriousness of the labor problem and the government's emergency measures. Currently, the government and the workers have reached a complete stalemate. Ramadier stated that he would no longer hold negotiations with the General Confederation of Labor. Various unions in Paris will meet on the 16th, which may cause some sympathy strikes. Currently, there are five labor strikes in France: Paris transport workers, Renault car factory, American railway workers, Paris tractor factory, and the weather station.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] The French government took firm measures today to deal with the transport workers' strike. The government has requisitioned 300 private buses to maintain the minimum level of transportation in the metropolis. It has also summoned temporary drivers to operate vehicles and 1,500 military trucks to temporarily carry passengers, but the strike is beginning to expand to other industries tonight.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] French merchant sailors are demanding improved treatment. If they do not receive a satisfactory answer today, then starting on Thursday morning, 6,000 officers and 25,000 sailors on French-flagged ships in French and Algerian ports will go on strike.</p>
<h3>Clayton Resigns</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] According to reliable sources, Undersecretary of State Clayton, one of the main planners of the Marshall Plan, has submitted his resignation to President Truman. Clayton's resignation is mainly due to personal health issues. He is 67 years old and one of the richest millionaires in the United States. He submitted his resignation a month ago, but Marshall retained him until now.</p>
<h3>Churchill Predicts the Soviets Will Withdraw from the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] Churchill broadcast on the 14th that the Soviet Union and its satellite states may withdraw from the United Nations, creating two worlds, but this division does not necessarily lead to war. Churchill's speech was similar in its directness to his speech in Fulton last year. He said that in fact, the Soviet Union's withdrawal would be a good thing, as both sides could then know themselves and their opponents. Churchill said that war occurs because the two sides in the conflict believe that their forces are equal, but if the Soviet Union and its dependencies withdraw from the United Nations and form an independent group, the forces of the two sides will never be equal.</p>
<h3>United Nations Economic Committee Approves Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] The UN General Assembly Economic Committee today voted to approve the Marshall Plan for European economic aid, with the Slavic bloc countries dissenting.</p>
<h3>China Supports UN Proposal to Establish a Small Assembly with Conditions; Soviets Disagree and Mock the US for Being Eager to Play with Fire</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: Lake Success News: The UN General Assembly Political Committee met today. China and Uruguay supported the US proposal to establish a 55-nation "Small Assembly", but Chinese Representative Gu Weijun insisted that the powers of the "Small Assembly" should be limited.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] The Soviet Union today attacked the US's proposal to the UN General Assembly to establish a temporary "Small United Nations Assembly". After US Representative Dulles presented the proposal in the Political Committee, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky immediately stood up and declared, "If the United States is willing not to include issues such as the Korean issue on the agenda, then the Assembly will not be "overworked". He reiterated the Soviet Union's proposal that if the United States agrees to withdraw its troops, Soviet troops will withdraw from Korea and "let the Koreans decide the form of their government themselves."</p>
<p>Vyshinsky said, "The United States claims on the one hand that the Assembly's work is too heavy, while on the other hand, the agenda is full of unnecessary topics, such as the independence of Korea, which should be submitted directly to the Koreans after the troops withdraw at the end of this year. The agenda also includes extremely difficult and contentious topics. What reason do you have to include them on the agenda? This is completely contrary to logic and reason." Vyshinsky attacked the US proposal, saying, "Dulles does not dare to directly state that he has a hidden reason that he cannot announce. Madmen often enjoy playing with fire, but it is regrettable that responsible figures in a large country like the United States are also eager to play with fire. The US proposal has received swift assistance from Bolivia, but this proposal not only fails to achieve the purpose of establishing the United Nations, but may have the opposite effect. It cannot strengthen the United Nations, but is sufficient to weaken it. This proposal will weaken the evil forces that oppose the sale of wars. After the "Small Assembly" is established, the United States' efforts to create new wars by propagandizing with a batch of lies can also be unobstructed. The Soviet delegation believes that any situation that weakens the United Nations at this time is enough to nourish new war peddlers. Dulles may have completely forgotten about this, otherwise Dulles would not have the courage to explain this matter." Vyshinsky said, "Although the US proposal has its secret nature, it ultimately shows that the United States is extremely dissatisfied with the way the United Nations is proceeding. When the United States found it impossible to legally abolish the veto power, it resorted to other methods. The Soviet delegation believes that the US proposal is only part of its plan, the purpose of which is not to respect the Charter, but to replace the Security Council with a similar committee in order to abolish the overall agreement between major powers, because this is precisely what makes it impossible for the United States to obtain dictatorial power in the United Nations."</p>
<h3>Impasse in Security Council Election of Members</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] The deadlock in the election of members to the Security Council does not seem easy to break. The Latin American delegation held another secret meeting last night, and they do not seem to have changed their position on supporting Ukraine. Rumors that six Latin American countries will switch to supporting India have not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>US Army Warns Soldiers to Defend Against Possible Soviet Attack</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The US Army printed a booklet on the 14th and distributed it to US troops around the world. The content warned the three services that the Soviet Union intends to use its control of the European continent to launch offensive wars in "any direction". The booklet is for US military commanders to teach soldiers about world geography and political knowledge. It also stated that the Soviet Union can move westward into Europe, eastward into China, and northward across the Arctic to North America. The Soviet Union's geographical situation is particularly favorable for offense and unfavorable for defense, because the Soviet territory is vast and the military is easy to disperse.</p>
<h3>Stalin on Long-Term Recuperation</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Moscow Radio broadcast today, revealing that Premier Stalin is currently recuperating in the Black Sea region. According to the radio station, Stalin met with members of the British Labour Party in the Black Sea region, at Shaqi. Stalin will celebrate his 60th birthday on the 21st of this month.

<h3>Results of Rome City Elections Announced: Left and Right Wings Equally Matched; Rumors of Gasperi Cabinet Reorganization</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 14th] The final vote count of the city council elections today showed that the Communist-controlled People's Bloc and the Christian Democrats each won 27 seats in the 80-seat city council. The difference in votes between the two parties was less than 1 percent. The remaining votes were divided among various small parties, ranging from moderate leftists to Fascists. With the two sides evenly matched, it is expected that the new council will fall into a stalemate on the issue of electing a mayor.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 14th] It is reported that the Christian Democrats intend to nominate the current Minister of Defense Qin Gulani as mayor, which confirms the rumors that Gasperi will reorganize the cabinet after the city elections. Some leaders of the moderate left-wing Republican and Social Workers' parties, such as Saragat, are expected to join the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Security Council Discusses Indo-Dutch Dispute; China Supports British Proposal; Jiang Tingfu Expresses Sympathy for Indonesian Independence Movement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 14th] Chinese Representative Jiang Tingfu stated in his speech to the Security Council today that China supports the Indonesian independence movement, but cannot agree with or support the various atrocities committed against civilians by irregular forces in the Indonesian army. We believe that this kind of behavior is not an appropriate way to move towards independence.</p>
<p>Although I have received many telegrams from overseas Chinese in Indonesia complaining about the abuse they have suffered from Indonesian irregular forces, I have not submitted them to the Security Council because: 1. I do not want to hinder the independence movement of the people of this fraternal country; 2. The Indonesian leaders have made sincere efforts to stop the atrocities. Although the overseas Chinese in Indonesia have suffered all kinds of abuse, in their telegrams to the Chinese government and myself, they still advocate that Indonesia should obtain political independence. The Chinese government can support the Soviet proposal for the complete withdrawal of Dutch troops, and can also support the Australian proposal for a limited withdrawal of Dutch troops, but this must be accompanied by guarantees that the various adverse conditions that will occur after the withdrawal of Dutch troops will not happen, because currently these guarantees are still lacking. Therefore, the Chinese delegation supports the British proposal, that this issue should be handed over to the three-person committee and the consular committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yen Exchange Rate: China Advocates Careful Decision; Discussion in the Allied Council for Japan</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The Allied Council for Japan held a meeting on the 15th. Chairman Sebald, the US representative, reported that without determining the Japanese yen exchange rate, foreign trade cannot be fully developed, so the exchange rate should be determined as soon as possible, and said that this was MacArthur's intention. The representatives present mostly agreed with this. The Chinese representative stated that in order to revive Japan's trade, it is indeed appropriate to determine the Japanese yen exchange rate as soon as possible, but Japan's economy has not yet returned to normal, and determining the exchange rate is a practical issue. We must pay particular attention to ensuring that it does not affect Japan's wage and price system, so we must decide carefully. British and Soviet representatives also stated that it was necessary to determine the exchange rate. It was subsequently decided to submit this issue for further discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Brazil May Sever Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>Seventh Letter from Poland: Floating Images of Society Behind the Iron Curtain – The Lonely Poles (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing for This Newspaper</p>
<p>"Foreign Minister Beck" died in Romania at the beginning of the war. After the Communist Party came to power, Piłsudski's achievements in "founding the country" were also completely erased. Piłsudski Square in the center of Warsaw is now renamed "Victory Square." The original bronze statue of Piłsudski has been removed. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the Polish Restoration (1914-1918) beneath the bronze wall still enjoys offerings of flowers and fragrant grasses. Although, purely in theory, the Communist Party once denied that the "restoration movement" originated from the wishes of the Polish people.</p>
<p>On the day of the Lublin government's independence day, I visited Piłsudski Square for the entire afternoon. It was a scenic spot imitating Versailles. Thousands of Polish men, women, and children were there watching the "show." In reality, watching the "show" was also a facade, because apart from the Communist Party's loudspeaker broadcasts, there was nothing exciting to see. People were just looking at each other, passing their lonely days.</p>
<p>The Polish people are lonely. I feel that using "lonely" to describe the spiritual life of the Polish people today is not an exaggeration. War and disaster caused the death of nine million young Polish men. A small Warsaw newspaper said: now, on average, nineteen young women are pursuing one young Polish man. Love in Warsaw, and in many other Polish towns, is developing in an unbalanced "couple force," and the spiritual life associated with love is especially terrifyingly lonely.</p>
<p>One evening after the sun had set, I strolled along "Marszałkowska" Avenue, the busiest street in Warsaw. A large group of lonely Polish people were watching two drunks arguing. The crowd surged back and forth like waves, using this to pass their lonely days.</p>
<p>The Polish government is now also making every effort to carry out cultural construction, and the Ministry of Culture has proclaimed the slogan "Providing Spiritual Life." At a press conference held by the International Propaganda Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I was very interested in hearing a report from the person in charge of drama movements in the Ministry of Culture. That gentleman said: Poland had no drama for a full six years during the Nazi occupation. After liberation, many theater buildings were destroyed. "Drama Movement" workers started rebuilding from the ruins, working through thorny thickets. To date, Poland already has thirty-three large-scale "national theaters," and the number of small-scale state-run theatrical troupes scattered throughout the country reaches eight thousand. In the past year, the total number of audiences in theaters across the country reached ten million, four times more than before the war. The Ministry of Culture also founded three advanced drama academies and is responsible for raising the salaries of actors across the country. Before the war, an actor earned an average of 4,000 to 6,000 Polish złoty, but now it has increased to 14,000 to 32,000 Polish złoty (monthly salary). He said, "Because prices have risen, the material life of drama workers is still difficult."</p>
<p>He said: It is not easy to save the spiritual life of the entire Polish nation. The Ministry of Culture is now working closely with the "National Drama Association" to promote work competitions, especially performances of great Polish dramatist "Wyspiański" and Shakespeare's famous plays. Fourteen national theaters participated in this work competition, and the results were particularly good. He also said: The Drama Association is a combined organization of writers, actors, and artists from all over Poland. The Ministry of Culture recently allocated 100 million Polish złoty to reward theater managers and actors with outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>At the press conference, several "insiders" who understood drama were present. British and American reporters were particularly interested in the Polish people's enthusiastic welcome of Shakespeare's plays. In addition, George Bernard Shaw's plays have also been translated into Polish. Over the past year, the Ministry of Culture has translated nearly a hundred famous foreign plays. Russian dramas such as those by Ostrovsky, Gogol, and Chekhov are also quite in line with the tastes of Polish audiences. "About one-fifth of the theaters are designated by the Ministry of Culture to stage excellent works by young writers, and the Polish government provides special bonuses for promising young playwrights. Pious Catholics in their twenties, Różewicz and the biology student Czyżewska, have both received this bonus one after another."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to see the drama competition being staged in Warsaw. During my very hurried stay, my overseas Chinese friends, Mr. and Mrs. Zhuo Jinlan, invited me to watch a Russian film. That day was Sunday, and several cinemas were designated for Communist Party members to watch movies for free, and others were not allowed to enter. We lingered in front of a commercial cinema on the southern section of Marszałkowska Avenue, where there were "scalpers" selling black market tickets facing us. My friends said: Buying movie tickets is not an easy thing in Warsaw. I often think of this sentence, thinking of those lonely Polish people!</p>

<h3>Six Electricity Companies Simultaneously Lament Hardship – Unanimously Request Price Increase Starting from October – Otherwise, Shanghai Will Become a World of Darkness</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The central government will make a decision on the adjustment of prices for various public utilities in this city within days. Regarding electricity prices, each company requests implementation starting from October 1st. Shanghai Electric Power Company and Huxi Electric Power Company are requesting an adjustment to 2,700 yuan per kilowatt-hour (currently 1,130 yuan per kilowatt-hour). The French-owned Yongdian Company is requesting an adjustment to 3,340 yuan per kilowatt-hour (currently 1,132 yuan per kilowatt-hour). The Chinese-owned Dianqi Company and Pudong Dianqi Company are requesting an adjustment to 3,360 yuan per kilowatt-hour (currently 1,255 yuan per kilowatt-hour). Zhabei Shuidian Company is requesting an adjustment to 3,370 yuan per kilowatt-hour (currently 1,260 yuan per kilowatt-hour). If this new price is approved by the central government, it will be retroactively applied from October 1st.</p>
<p>The six major companies held a reception for reporters yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. on the sixth floor of the Shanghai Electric Power Company on Nanjing Road to discuss the electricity price issue. Present were Hopekin and Wang Jingrong from Shanghai Electric Power; Xue Meng and Yang Guangyu from the French-owned Shuidian; Huang Bingquan from the Chinese-owned Dianqi; Lu Zidong from Zhabei Shuidian; Tong Shoumin from Pudong Dianqi; and over thirty reporters from various newspapers. During the meeting, representatives from each company reported on their difficulties, stating that the companies are still charging fees based on the prices adjusted on July 1st, but the exchange rate has been adjusted from 12,000 yuan to 56,000 yuan. Companies that need foreign exchange for raw materials account for 80 percent. If electricity prices are not adjusted promptly, they will incur losses to the point of being unable to sustain themselves. Each company also unanimously requested the implementation of an automatic electricity price adjustment method to seek a permanent solution.</p>
<p>Shanghai Electric Power Company Loses 3.3 Billion Daily</p>
<p>Wang Jingrong, an engineer at Shanghai Electric Power Company, explained the retroactive collection of electricity fees, stating: This method of retroactive collection of electricity fees is entirely reasonable. Taking Shanghai Electric Power Company as an example, since the exchange rate adjustment on September 25th, the company has been losing 3.3 billion yuan daily. In the past 20 days, expenditures have reached 112 billion yuan, while income has only been 46 billion yuan, resulting in a loss of 66 billion yuan. The company is unable to repay this amount and can only take it from users. The main items of electricity cost are fuel and maintenance materials, supplies, salaries, and basic capital costs. Since the adjustment of electricity prices on July 1st, all have soared in price. Therefore, an application has been submitted to adjust the electricity price for ordinary users to 2,700 yuan per kilowatt-hour starting from October 1st. This projection assumes that 50 percent of the import tax on fuel oil is levied at the contract price of Shanghai Electric Power Company. If the import tax is calculated at market price, each kilowatt-hour will increase by another 360 yuan. Before the new electricity price is approved, the company loses more than 99 billion yuan per month. If this situation continues for only a short period of time, the company will be unable to purchase fuel or pay wages, and Shanghai will have no electricity supply.</p>
<p>Lu Zidong of Zhabei Shuidian Company stated: The company uses coal entirely. It is allocated by the Fuel Management Committee. Even if only the coal price is calculated, excluding other expenses, one kilowatt-hour of electricity requires 1,500 yuan, but the current electricity fee is 1,260 yuan per kilowatt-hour, so it is impossible to sustain operations.</p>
<p>French-owned Shuidian Hopes to Reduce User Waste</p>
<p>Yang Guangyu of the French-owned Shuidian Company stated: The company's entire power supply comes from diesel generators. Most of the area consists of residential households, and industrial electricity consumption accounts for only 20 percent. Therefore, it is hoped that the electricity fee for residential lighting can be increased, while the electricity fee for production use can be lowered, so as to reduce user waste and increase production. Huang Bingquan of the Chinese-owned Dianqi Company stated: The company's 16,000 kilowatt generators were transported to North China by the Japanese during the occupation of Shanghai. Currently, 80 percent of the electricity is purchased from Shanghai Electric Power Company. Because the transmission line is as long as 35 kilometers, there are significant losses along the way. Therefore, the electricity price requested for adjustment is slightly different from that of Shanghai Electric Power Company. The electricity price in Suzhou in October is 5,660 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and other places have prices as high as 10,000 yuan or more per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, the electricity price in Shanghai is actually very low. Tong Shoumin of Pudong Dianqi Company also reported on the company's losses and requested prompt adjustment.</p>
<p>Adjustment Method to Be Discussed Today</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The automatic adjustment method for public utility prices in this city, which the Public Utilities Bureau previously planned to submit, has been reviewed by two experts from the Electrical Engineering Society, Zhong Zhaolin and Hong Chuanjiong, who have drafted an opinion and sent it to the bureau. The Public Utilities Bureau has specifically scheduled a discussion meeting this afternoon to synthesize opinions from all parties and discuss them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, visited President Zhang of the National Bank yesterday regarding the issue of import taxes on fuel oil, requesting that they be levied according to the contract price of the electricity company, rather than calculated according to the market price, in order to reduce electricity costs. President Zhang expressed his approval and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for consultation.</p>
<h3>Automobile Fuel Quota to Be Distributed in Three Levels</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The method for rationing automobile fuel in this city will change.

It was decided to divide cars and trucks into three levels (large, medium, and small) based on their curb weight, and allocate the actual amount of fuel used. The detailed method will be discussed and decided by the Public Utilities Group of the City Council, which will convene today.</p>
<h3>Using Legal Campaign Activities to Set a Good Example of Democracy – Kuomintang Candidate Party Members' Symposium – Jiang Jingguo Attends and Encourages Efforts</h3>
<p>The Kuomintang Municipal Party Department convened a symposium yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Yingcha Club on Shaoxing Road, gathering party members in this city who are candidates for the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Municipal Council, and invited Instructor Jiang Jingguo to attend and give instructions. Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, and candidates Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Zhongxing, Zhan Wenyu, Zhou Yizhi, Cao Jun, Ma Junshuo, Fang Zhichao, Wang Xinheng, Luo Jiaowei, Jin Zhenyu, Jiang Hong, Qian Jianqiu, Shi Zhifu, Mao Zipei, Zheng Ziliang, Zhao Junhao, and over one hundred others attended. Chairman Fang first introduced each candidate to Instructor Jiang and read aloud a telegram from the Central Party Department, which stated that comrades of this party participating in the election should adopt a new style in order to establish the party's credibility among voters. All forms of bribery, coercion, and violence should be prohibited, and normal legal activities, such as speeches, propaganda, encouraging construction, and promoting public welfare, should be earnestly carried out as a demonstration for the people and comrades, in line with the purpose of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization and Economy Movement.</p>
<p>Recognize Obligations, Not Rights</p>
<p>Instructor Jiang Jingguo was then invited to give instructions, saying: "Holding this election is a major task in the history of our party. Now, the communist bandits are harming the country and the people, and military suppression of the rebellion will be difficult to end in the short term. Prices are soaring incessantly, and the people are suffering greatly. Holding elections is very difficult. However, in order to take into account the needs of the environment and cooperate with the revolutionary process, the central government has decided to hold the elections as scheduled, even in the midst of hardship. As party members, we should understand the party's difficulties and the President's distress, absolutely obey the party's orders, and engage in campaigning with legal actions, setting a good example of democracy. All of you comrades have a glorious history of serving the party and have made great contributions to society. I hope that you will first of all recognize that campaigning is a party member's obligation, not a right, and should sacrifice personal interests to take care of the party's interests. Currently, many unreasonable election phenomena are occurring in various places, such as bribery, coercion, and violence. These should not exist in Shanghai. In short, I hope that you will obey the central government's regulations, engage in reasonable campaign activities to reduce the party's difficulties, successfully complete the election work in Shanghai, and serve as a model for all parts of the country."</p>
<p>Personal Interests Should Be Sacrificed</p>
<p>After his speech, Mayor Wu was invited to speak, saying: Candidates should consider being elected as an obligation, not as a right, and should sacrifice personal interests to protect the party's interests. Campaigning must adopt legal activities, and elections must not be conducted in an illegal manner. We should emulate the style of political party elections in democratic countries. At this point, Chairman Fang reiterated to the candidates: You should immediately mobilize and go to various districts to give speeches to the people, in coordination with the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction. You should use various forms of publicity, written and oral, to replace bribery. After the speech, candidates Luo Dunwei, Cheng Zhongxing, Pan Gongyan, Chen Peide, Qiu Xisheng, and others successively expressed their opinions, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. At about 5 o'clock, Chairman Fang summarized everyone's opinions, made a concrete conclusion, and, after serving refreshments, announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Permitting Improvement in Compilation of Workers' Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>Water Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, and others went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and proposed suggestions to improve the compilation of the index: 1. For the rice item, the government is still using the base price of the first-grade Saigon rice and second-grade old rice in 1936. However, the rice currently included in the index is the low-quality of配給米(rationed rice), and the base price should be corrected. 2. The rent price set by the municipal government is very low, especially the water fee item in the rent, which is calculated inaccurately. 3. The rice, coal, oil, and other items in the daily necessities item are all compiled based on the price of rationed goods. In fact, some workers have not been allocated rations and still purchase coal and oil on the black market. This should be corrected when compiling the index. Director Wu and Director Zhang of the Statistics Office responded one by one, stating that regarding the first item, the rice price, the municipal government will decide after a detailed investigation of the base price in 1936. For the second item, the rent price, the municipal government has improved the calculation, that is, the water fee item, which was originally surveyed every six months, will be changed to every three months. For the third item, the municipal government plans to compile a monthly index based on the market price of coal, oil, and other items at the end of each month, and compare it with the original index compiled based on the rationed price to calculate the difference. If the factory does not collect rations for the workers, the difference will be paid in addition to the salary. This point will be proposed and passed by Director Zhang at tomorrow's municipal government meeting and will be implemented immediately.</p>

<h3>Dancing Girl Reverses Testimony During Continued Trial for Robbery</h3>

Cao Ping was wearing a coat, white leather shoes, and covering her face with a handkerchief. She vehemently denied holding a gun to rob, reversing her previous testimony. Judge Shao asked who Zhang Guanglie was to her. Cao replied that he was a friend. When asked whether they had discussed holding a gun to rob Cai's home, Cao firmly denied it, saying that she only borrowed money from Cai Zhu, but she refused, so she snatched off the gold bracelet, which Zhang Guanglie took away. Cai called the police from the window, and she and Zhang fled to the Bund Park. Then, accomplice Zhang Nuchun testified: He had been sentenced to eight years for robbery and had known Zhang Guanglie since June. Because he was selling rice from Songjiang, he asked Zhang to help him sell it. Zhang owed him money, and Zhang asked him to come to Shanghai to pay him back. He is a vocational youth and does not have any firearms. On July 7, he waited on Xizang Road at 11 a.m. for about a quarter of an hour. Zhang Guanglie handed him the gold bracelet. Together, they went to Bund Park. He did not go to Cai Zhu's home. The court adjourned the case for further trial.</p>

<h3>Difficult to Determine Price for Six Dishes and One Soup; Restaurant Industry Says It Will Affect Nutrition</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Since the authorities announced the regulations for economizing on banquets, the Restaurant Industry Association convened a meeting of members of the fifteen major cuisine categories in this city yesterday to discuss the price issue of six dishes and one soup. No resolution was reached until late in the evening, and it was heard that the meeting would continue on the 18th. According to the members of various restaurants in the industry, the most significant impact of the regulations for economizing on banquets will be on some of the larger restaurants. The restriction of six dishes and one soup may reduce their total turnover by half. However, most medium-sized restaurants currently focus on selling snacks and客飯 (set meals), and in fact, they have very few banquets, so the economizing regulations will not have any impact on them. As for the industry negotiating prices on its own, there are many difficulties at this time of fluctuating prices. It was also heard that the Western Restaurant industry will also convene a meeting within days to discuss the price of two dishes and one soup.</p>
<p>Economizing on Banquets to Begin on the 20th; Foreign Wine and Shark Fin for Home Use Not Prohibited</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau, the 3rd Battalion of the Military Police, the Police Bureau, the New Life Movement Committee, the restaurant industry, the Western restaurant and coffee industry, the catering industry, the seafood industry, the hotel industry, and other nine units discussed the continued implementation of measures for economizing on dishes at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and resolved: Economizing on banquets will begin on the 20th of this month. The regulations limit Western cuisine to two dishes and one soup, and Chinese cuisine to six dishes and one soup. The prices will be set by the Chinese and Western restaurant industries themselves and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval by the 18th. Shark fins, sea cucumbers, and ship-imported foreign wines are all luxury goods and are absolutely prohibited from sale, but not prohibited for home use. At the same time, the seafood companies are ordered to copy a list of all non-domestically produced seafood and submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau for review to determine which items are prohibited from sale and which can be sold.</p>
<h3>Random Inspection of Five Cotton Mills; Effective Measures Also to Be Taken Regarding Paper</h3>

<p>Rice for the Poor to Be Distributed at Legally Stipulated Price, Still 160,000 Yuan</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the People's Food Allocation Committee had already instructed all districts to collect rice for the poor, so general distribution would begin no later than next week. The price will remain the original price of 160,000 yuan per unit (plus freight). After expanding the scope of allocation to include the moderately and marginally poor, the total allocation volume has increased from 180,000 dan per period to 280,000 dan. The government must subsidize 300,000 yuan per dan on average, so the People's Food Allocation Committee loses more than 100 billion yuan each month. The total number of destitute, moderately poor, and marginally poor in the city is approximately 400,000. Those who are hidden poor can directly apply to the Allocation Committee in writing for rice, and Director Wu stated that approval will be granted with sympathy. There is no quota limit for this special discounted rice; the quantity will be determined based on the actual situation.</p>

<h3>Principal and Female Students in Court; Jiang Ruzhen States Two Reasons, Declares No Bestial Conduct</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Jiang Ruzhen, the principal of the private Huade Elementary School at No. 64 West Warehouse Road in this city, was accused of repeatedly raping Zhu Yuexian, a 13-year-old female student at the school, and Zhang Juying and others. After the incident, Jiang fled to Jiangyin but was arrested and brought to justice. He was tried in the First Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning. Presiding Judge Meng first interrogated Jiang Ruzhen, who was wearing a gray cloth short shirt and pants, with slightly gray hair, tightly biting his lower lip, and occasionally displaying a ferocious smile. He stated, "I am 55 years old, from Jiangyin, and have been the principal of Huade for eight years. Zhu Yuexian and Zhang Juying are both third-grade students and live next door to me." Judge Meng asked if it was true that he had called Zhu Yuexian upstairs in March of last year under the pretext of tutoring and raped her. Jiang flatly denied it. Zhu Yuexian suddenly shouted from the witness stand, "You're lying!" causing everyone in the audience to turn their heads. The court then questioned the defendant, asking if he admitted to raping Zhang Juying in June of this year. Jiang repeatedly denied it, saying, "If there were such a thing, I would be simply a beast." Zhu Yuexian then testified, stating that on a certain day in March of last year, at around 7:00 AM, she and another female student, Zhou Changming, were both raped by Jiang, and that Jiang threatened them afterward not to reveal it, or he would beat them to death. She added that on the morning of June 2nd of this year, at around 7:00 AM, she was raped again and finally told her mother, who reported it to the police. Zhang Juying stated, "On a certain morning in June of last year, at around 9:00 AM, Jiang called me upstairs under the pretext of tutoring in Chinese and raped me. After Zhu Yuexian reported it to the police this year, I told my mother, and we went to the Municipal Hospital for examination." At this point, the court asked Jiang if he admitted it. Jiang shook his head to deny it. The court asked, "Then why did they accuse you?" Jiang replied, "It's a long story. Zhu Yuexian's mother is my neighbor, and I often go to her house to play cards. On February 1st of this year, Zhu's mother borrowed 2 million yuan from me and has not repaid it. After I repeatedly demanded repayment, she ordered Zhu Yuexian to call me to collect it on May 29th. When I reached the alley entrance, I was met by a dozen thugs who asked me why I often took female students to the City God Temple, and said that someone said I was engaging in improper conduct. They demanded 5 million yuan from me, and I discussed it with Zhu Changgui, the owner of a funeral shop. Unexpectedly, Zhu colluded with Zhu Yuexian's mother and reported me to the police." Zhu Yuexian's mother, Zhu Hu Maozhu, said, "After I found out about this, I immediately questioned Jiang the next day, asking what he was doing calling Yuexian upstairs and closing the door. Jiang did not answer and after ten minutes said: Zhu, my teacher, please forgive me. I hate it so I went forward and slapped him once, he asked me not to be angry and sit down, and then I stepped forward and slapped him a second time, before taking Yuexian to the hospital for testing, then to the Penglai Police Station. As for Jiang saying that I had an illicit relationship with him, it is completely untrue." Jiang made two final defenses: Given my age and status, I would not do such a thing. There are older girls and female teachers in my school, aged seventeen or eighteen to over twenty, and if I were to consider such a thing, I would not consider a thirteen-year-old girl. The court ordered that the case be reheard on a later date.</p>

<h3>Autumn Season; Visiting Two Silk Factories in Chang'an</h3>
<p>[Report from our Correspondent in Hangzhou, October 10th] Chang'an is located in a strategic position on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. It has two silk factories, Chang'an and Lianyuan. I had the opportunity to visit them. The Chang'an Silk Factory has 192 silk reeling machines, most of which are the multi-strand type from 1925. There are also cocoon making machines of the Chiba type, two generators, one using kerosene as fuel with 32 horsepower, and one using coal as fuel with 28 horsepower. Each batch produces three and a half dan of silk. There are more than 500 workers, with more female workers than male workers. They also have an inspection room, using black leather boards and electric light to illuminate the silk's uniformity and whether it has knots. In their factory, there is also an old-fashioned sitting reeling machine. The air is relatively poor, with water vapor and the smell of silkworms mingling, making it very uncomfortable. There is also a re-reeling machine, which re-reels the reeled silk, and a sorting room where the silk is made into skeins. A simple machine is used here, which is also made in Japan. There is also a selection process, where a machine is used to remove the fluff from the cocoons and select the good cocoons. But it is said that this machine is also made in Japan. After being made into skeins, they are made into bundles. Each small bundle has thirty skeins, also called thirty pieces, and each piece has thirty small bundles, with each piece equivalent to one guan dan.</p>
<p>Government Loans for Cocoon Purchasing</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the factory, the government lends us money to buy cocoons. After the cocoons are bought, they are reeled into silk, and the silk is handed over to the government, which exports it to foreign countries to compete in the market. Recently, our exports of silkworm silk seem to have revived somewhat, so silk prices have been relatively high recently. However, silk factories can only obtain some operating expenses, at most only 10-20%. The factory is naturally not satisfied. The person in charge of the factory said, "The factory's expenses are also very high."</p>
<p>Rotary vs. Chiba and Others</p>
<p>I went on to visit the Lianyuan Silk Factory. The Lianyuan Factory has 180 machines, with 36 new rotary machines and 134 fixed cocoon reeling machines of the Chiba type like those at the Chang'an Silk Factory. The so-called rotary machine randomly places the cocoons in the water onto the needle hooks, and they will be reeled. This is different from the fixed ones, which require the cocoon silk to be placed on a certain needle hook before it can be reeled. The rotary type saves much more time, and the work efficiency is naturally much higher. Currently, the most modern silk reeling machine in this factory can be operated by one person for ten hooks, but there is a new type in Japan that can be operated by one person for forty hooks, making its manufacturing efficiency twice as high as ours.</p>
<p>Collecting Handling Fees</p>
<p>All other machines and processes at the Lianyuan Factory are the same as those at the Chang'an Factory, but it lacks an inspection process. If we want to sell our silk abroad, this inspection process is indispensable. They have a generator of 60 kilowatts. They can also produce three dan of silk per day. The government also lends money to buy cocoons, which the factory then buys to reel into silk. After the silk is reeled, it is handed over to the state for foreign trade, and some handling fees are collected in the process.</p>
<p>Lack of Competitive Interest</p>
<p>Both of the above silk factories are privately owned and operated by shareholders. Speaking in terms of Zhejiang Province, the scale is not too small, but I asked them if they could fund their own cocoon purchases. They said, "Currently, each dan of cocoons costs more than 1 million yuan, and our capital is not enough to meet the demand. However, if the government always lends money to silk factories to buy cocoons, and the silk factories only receive a small handling fee after reeling the silk, then the quality of the product will decrease, and the seriousness of the work will also decrease." These few words can at least be used as a reference for the government. The government originally intended to attract foreign exchange and rectify the silk products, so it did this. This approach can prevent cocoon merchants from profiting from it and prevent silk merchants from exploiting it and damaging international reputation with inferior products, which can be said to be relatively reasonable. However, the government should reward the silk factories for their products and work efficiency to encourage them to have competitive interests.</p>
<p>Need to Create Ourselves</p>
<p>I see that both of these factories are using Japanese machines. Originally, our country had a silk market in the international community very early on. At that time, there were no Japanese silk prices, only Chinese silk prices. Unfortunately, our predecessors did not do well, so that the international community valued Japanese silk instead of our country's silk prices. We cannot blame fate, the Japanese bury their heads in research, and we abandon ourselves. From today on, we must research and create ourselves, and never rely on others again. We must also invent our own silk reeling machines and cocoon making machines.</p>
<p>Approved Cocoon Purchase Prices</p>
<p>The autumn cocoons are about to be harvested, and the government lends each factory 1.08 million yuan per dan. According to factory personnel, farmers are willing to sell only at 1.8 million yuan per dan, otherwise, they prefer to make native silk. I asked about the outlet for native silk, and they told the reporter that native silk can be sent to silk shops to weave silk. In any case, in order to encourage the silk cocoon industry, the government should conduct a clear investigation into the raw material production areas of the silk cocoon industry. Facts are facts, and should not rely on reports, let alone fabricate them themselves. They should formulate cocoon purchase prices based on statistics so that this year's autumn silk can show a new face in the international market! (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<h3>Teachers in Various Schools in Taiwan Inherit the Old System of Official Titles from the Japanese Colonial Period; They Recently Requested the Education Department to Change to the National Official System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taipei Fifteenth Dispatch] During the Japanese colonial period, teachers in various schools in Taiwan were appointed by the supervising officials with the official ranks of "Fu-nin," "So-nin," and "Han-nin" respectively. Since the restoration, this practice has been difficult to change. Recently, teachers in various schools have requested the Education Department to follow the old system and change to the national official system, using "Jie-nin," "Jian-nin," and "Wei-nin" to reappoint. The Education Department believes that this matter is of great importance and cannot be decided arbitrarily, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Education for instructions.</p>
<h3>A Report with the Spirit of the Times; The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and China (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>As of October this year, 9,000 copies of Chinese scientific periodicals have been donated, with 25 volumes per copy, totaling 222,500 volumes, as well as 5,000 pictures, and 472 books and pamphlets. Recently, it was also discussed to send educational film machines to various countries, and it has been decided to donate two machines to China. It is also under discussion to send French art works, and it will be decided how many copies will be donated to China. However, the library group has extremely high expectations for China. Firstly, in order to understand the current situation and needs of libraries in various UNESCO member countries for the purpose of relief and donation, it issued the first survey form of 250 copies to the Chinese Ministry of Education in March of this year, asking them to forward it to various medical libraries and educational and academic institutions, and directly sent 166 copies of this survey form to various libraries and universities in China. To this day, only 26 copies of this survey form have been filled out and returned to the library group, which is too few and detrimental to China. Secondly, UNESCO has printed two publications related to libraries. After the first issue was published, 250 copies were sent to the Chinese Ministry of Education in April of this year, asking them to distribute it (125 copies were sent by airmail, and the other half by ordinary mail). The number of 250 copies is far from enough for the vast national, provincial, municipal, and private schools and all medical libraries in China. It is hoped to obtain the addresses of various libraries in China in order to directly contact them, and it is hoped that libraries in various parts of China, for their own benefit, will directly establish contact with the UNESCO library group.</p>
<p>The summer camp for international teachers on the application of taxation was a project of the International Education Understanding Group.

<p>As for the Natural Science Group, Mr. Jan Smid was dispatched to leave Paris for China on October 3 to establish a Far East Regional Natural Science Cooperation Office in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Next, the various international conferences held within UNESCO. For example, at the International Conference of Drama Experts, China originally invited Yu Shangyuan to attend, but Yu could not make it, and Xie Shoukang, who was in Paris at the time, attended temporarily. It was decided to establish an International Drama Academy, and China was elected as one of the preparatory committee members. As for the conference on the needs of the news industry, radio, and film materials in war-affected countries, China's representative was Feng Shang. It was decided that five million US dollars worth of newsprint should be used to relieve China, France, and the Netherlands. It was also decided that China should have at least 18 million radio receivers, train 300 experts, and apply 900,000 broadcast machines in schools. It was also decided that the film relief fund should be between 20 million and 25 million US dollars, 10% of which should be used for developing feature films and 90% for making educational films. It was determined that China was one of the countries most in need of relief. It was also decided to establish an International Journalism Academy in Paris, with an estimated annual cost of 200,000 to 250,000 US dollars. This amount will be provided in part by UNESCO and in part by donations from various member states. These resolutions will be submitted to the second annual conference to be held in Mexico for final decision. Also, at the Philosophy and Humanities Conference, China had Luo Zhongshu, the philosophical advisor in UNESCO, and Tao Menghe, who arrived temporarily to attend. Their work and opinions were noticed and welcomed by various countries. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Hualian Football Team Draws with the Singapore British Air Force; 2 to 2; Shanghai Team's Performance is Subpar</h3>
<p>[Reuters Singapore Fifteenth Dispatch] The Shanghai Hualian football team played against the British Air Force here at the Besa Stadium yesterday, drawing with a score of 2 to 2. The Shanghai team's performance was not as good as before, especially in the early stages of the game. The British team scored a goal ten minutes into the game.

<h3>Current Situation of the Expedition Team; Obvious Progress in Performance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Article] From the charity basketball game last night, we saw the current situation of the "Expedition Team". Compared with the situation when they came to Shanghai in May this year, there has been much progress.</p>
<p>The current "Expedition Team" is obviously different. They already know [missing information], and they are turning the limited [missing information] to the lowest limit. Last night, they defeated the Shantou team easily. [missing information]'s [missing information], most of the breakthroughs were slammed in, and the [missing information] has gradually gotten on track. The reason for being able to defeat Shantou easily is due to these points.</p>
<p>In general, the "Expedition Team" has become a stable, organized, and intelligent traveling team, while still maintaining the speed and accuracy of shooting. Therefore, the "Expedition Team" has made progress. In terms of personnel, Gan [missing information] has replaced Li Wenning's position and has become the main general in scoring and [missing information]. He is the most continuous scorer in the "Expedition Team".</p>
<p>The defeat of the oil team cannot be simply attributed to "luck". When attacking, although the oil team can make full use of [missing information] tactics, they still lack [missing information], while the "Expedition Team" guards [missing information] and is full of color. Chang Bo prevented the Shantou [missing information] from breaking through the last barrier. The Shantou team has always relied on Lin [missing information] and Chen Qingjiang for points. In yesterday's game, Chen Qingjiang was abnormal, and Lin's 45-degree angle mid-range shot, although the angle has been widened, lost its accuracy, which is also a reason for the failure. The progress of the "Expedition Team" gives the "Hua Lian" a major threat. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>Under Strict Supervision by the Authorities, Rice, Flour, and Oil Prices Begin to Fall, Industry Insiders Hope to Streamline Sources and Incentivize Transportation</h3>
<p>The military authorities in this city are using forceful measures to suppress prices and investigate individuals hoarding and manipulating the market. The public is feeling insecure and is selling off goods. Yesterday, prices of various commodities generally fell. A total of more than 12,000 dan of rice and grain arrived in the northern and southern markets, and the market was filled with selling pressure. Prices of all grains fell across the board. Medium-grade white japonica rice fell by 350,000 yuan, indica rice fell by 340,000 yuan, and Baiyuan rice fell by 230,000 yuan. Flour sales were sluggish, with supply exceeding demand, and prices fell by 20,000 yuan, while bran fell by over 10,000 yuan. Transactions in the edible oil market were sparse, with only a very small number of transactions between oil firms. Oil factories' asking prices were largely ignored by major buyers. On the same day, Lou Sheng oil was priced at 2,100,000 yuan (previously as high as 2,300,000 yuan), soybean oil at 2,000,000 yuan (previously as high as 2,250,000 yuan), raw rapeseed oil at 1,650,000 yuan (previously as high as 1,900,000 yuan), cooked rapeseed oil at 1,400,000 yuan (previously as high as 1,600,000 yuan), and raw sesame oil at 1,900,000 yuan (previously as high as 2,150,000 yuan). Raw materials also showed the same trend, with raw peanuts falling from 1,010,000 yuan to 900,000 yuan, and soybeans falling from 440,000 yuan to 390,000 yuan. Sesame seeds fell from 820,000 yuan to 770,000 yuan. According to relevant sources, if this trend can continue, it will be beneficial to the people's welfare. Otherwise, it will be necessary to increase production and massively sell off goods to suppress oil prices. Regarding the former, the China Industrial and Mining Corporation (CITC) has already taken it into account. President Zhang of the National Bank has recently approved a large sum to be entrusted to the Third District Oil Factory Association to purchase raw materials for the second time from the production areas. It is expected that in the short term, daily production of soybean, rapeseed, and sesame oil will reach 10,000 dan each. Regarding the latter, the municipal government has decided that the China Edible Oil Company should quickly transport 10,000 dan of raw oil from Qingdao to Shanghai, and cooperate with the Zhongzhi factory to maintain daily rationing.</p>
<p>Responsible Person of Southern Market Analyzes the Reasons for Recent Rice Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>The soaring rice prices in recent days are a great threat to people's livelihood. The responsible person of the Southern Market Rice Industry Market issued a statement saying that the reasons for the fluctuations in rice prices in this city are as follows: The substantial increase in prices of public utilities and the drastic fluctuations in other commodity prices. The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan are frequently raising prices due to the impact of borrowing and taxation. The authorities are purchasing goods in the Wuhu area at market prices. The provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi have banned exports. The business tax on food grains has not been waived. A small number of citizens are protecting the value of currency and making efforts to purchase and store goods. The rice purchased by the grain merchants in this city has not yet arrived. We hope that the authorities, under the principle of not harming farmers or afflicting the people, will quickly coordinate a comprehensive, practical, and effective solution so that grain merchants have something to follow. In addition, we hope that the following points will be selected and listed: Streamline the sources of goods and facilitate transportation. Waive taxes and encourage transportation (such as the business tax levied on one item multiple times should not be levied). Restore agricultural loans and handle mortgages. Sell off public grain to stabilize public sentiment. Accelerate rationing and follow through on promises.</p>
<h3>Market Filled with Calls to Sell, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue Downtrend, 42-Count Blue Phoenix Down 3 Million Compared to Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was such that, due to the authorities' thorough investigation of warehouses and yarn factories' account books, people were even more timid. Furthermore, with tight monetary conditions, many scattered small sellers were cutting prices to sell, and the asking prices for various yarns fell. The final asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix was 32.5 million yuan, a further drop of 3 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse was down by 1.1 million yuan, 16-count Guangming was down by 1.3 million yuan, and other yarns of various counts were also down by 1 million to 2.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was also affected by the authorities' determination to suppress commodity prices, and the guild was instructed to order its members to register within a time limit. Furthermore, yesterday's supply of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth by the Fangxiong Company was uniformly allocated to applicants according to their requests, ensuring sufficient supply. With continued large transfers into banks and a tight monetary policy, public sentiment was weak, and the market was filled with calls to sell. Prices for various cloths declined across the board. The final price for Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 820,000 yuan, a further drop of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other various fine cloths, such as serge and twill, also fell by 40,000 to 70,000 or 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Negotiated Prices Unchanged</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The negotiated prices for cotton yarn by the Textile Adjustment Committee remained unchanged yesterday. The original price of 15.2 million yuan was maintained for 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market continued to weaken, with few transactions. Buyers took advantage of the price suppression to adopt a very cautious approach. The highest exchange price for Lingdou cotton was 4.48 million yuan, a further drop of 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Huoji cotton rebounded slightly by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. There were few transactions for other grades, but users were not enthusiastic. Around 800 bales were traded. Another 200 dan were sent to the factory at a price of 4.5 million yuan for Lingdou cotton and 4.42 million to 4.48 million yuan for Lingshi cotton. Huoji cotton was priced at 3.6 million to 3.73 million yuan, Hancu cotton at 3.75 million yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 67,500 to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Rises Quickly, Falls Rapidly, Down About 20 Million in Two Days, Factory Silk Quiet, Silk Goods Also Lower</h3>
<p>The rise and fall of the rayon market were rapid. In two days, it fell by nearly 20 million yuan. Yesterday morning, the opening price for 120 count Asahi rayon was between 77 and 78 million yuan. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand and weak public sentiment, it declined steadily. The midday price was around 4 million yuan, and it continued to weaken in the afternoon. The final selling price was 72.5 million yuan. By evening, public sentiment suddenly turned for the better, and asking prices gradually rose by about 4 or 5 million yuan, but no transactions were made.</p>

In the afternoon, due to the continued decline in rayon prices, public sentiment gradually weakened, and asking prices for various grades were reduced by about 1 or 2 million yuan. Grade C was asking for 70 million yuan, with a counteroffer of 68 million yuan, but no transactions were made. Another batch of 7 or 8 dan was traded, with high grade costing 67 million to 7.5 million yuan. Gan silk high grade was priced at around 48 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Goods: The market declined yesterday following the raw materials. Due to more selling than buying, the decline of real silk covers was still severe. Dacheng and Huaqiang goods were traded at 24 million yuan after the market opened, but then declined step by step. By the close, it was trading at 3 million yuan for the next day, and finally fell to 2.5 million yuan for the next day. Hua Jin crepe was asking for 55,000 yuan yesterday, but there was a lack of transactions. Other various goods also continued to weaken.</p>
<h3>After the Announcement of Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Materials, Various Reactions</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Ji Chaoding, Director of the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, issued a statement yesterday regarding the government's decision on the measures for handling goods arriving in Shanghai with self-provided foreign exchange, as follows: After the Import and Export Control Commission issued an announcement on August 21, stipulating that all goods that had already been shipped and were en route before August 16 of this year, but had not yet obtained an import permit, must be registered within a limited time, the issue of handling goods arriving at the port and shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without a permit arose. Now, the measures for handling this issue have been approved by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 14th. In the current environment of managing trade and foreign exchange, in my personal opinion, this measure has taken all aspects into account and is well-considered. However, the government must avoid allowing goods to fall into the hands of hoarders when allocating and purchasing materials in the future. If the raw materials and equipment allocated to the industrial sector can be truly used for production, then at this time of material scarcity, the injection of a large amount of materials into the market can benefit both production and consumption.</p>
<p>Importers and Exporters Say It Will Affect Prices</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] After the government decided to purchase imported goods with self-provided foreign exchange, the reporter specifically interviewed Zhang Yaozhang, Chairman of the Importers and Exporters Association, to inquire about his opinion. According to him: "Importers and exporters have already exchanged opinions on this matter and will make concrete representations to the government in the future. I personally believe that the government's decision on the purchase measures is far from what the relevant authorities have said to importers and exporters in the past. From the government's point of view, the purchase measures have three benefits: The government can control a large amount of materials and reduce currency issuance. The foreign exchange required for the next quota allocation can be saved because there is a large amount of imported materials on hand. Under the current purchase measures, the government can obtain significant profits. However, if merchants are unwilling to have their funds frozen for three years and re-export the goods, then in today's economic crisis, it will definitely have a negative impact on prices."</p>
<h3>Textile Adjustment Committee Decides on Two Principles for Implementing Joint Cotton Price Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened its 14th regular meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Liu Siying reported on three points: The recent implementation of price negotiation and joint distribution. Implementing joint price negotiation in cotton markets in various locations to avoid fluctuations in the cotton market. Measures for handling the registration of yarn and cloth inventory.</p>
<p>It is heard that the joint cotton price negotiation will be jointly negotiated by the Textile Construction, private factories, the Farmers Bank of China, and cotton merchants. The two principles are: Protecting the legitimate profits of cotton farmers. Do not rush to buy cotton to avoid unreasonable fluctuations in the cotton market.</p>
<p>Six District Cotton Textile Guild to Assist in Inspecting Yarn Factories</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Six District Cotton Textile Guild held its 27th board meeting at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. The agenda items discussed included: The Textile Adjustment Committee's notification to inspect the purchase, sale, transportation, and storage of cotton yarn in the city's yarn factories and yarn shops, requesting that staff be dispatched to assist in the case. It was resolved that the guild would send staff to participate. During the meeting, the members exchanged opinions on the conversation with the three members of the National Economic Commission and Minister Chen, and they hoped that the government would import as much foreign cotton as possible, the government would do its best to assist in various production conditions, and the Textile Adjustment Committee would continue to implement a flexible price negotiation system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Six District Cotton Textile Guild notified its member factories yesterday that the contract period for the "Industry and Trade Bureau's" cotton allocation has been agreed upon. Shanghai factories can contact Manager Sun Dehe at the Industry and Trade Bureau to negotiate and sign contracts from now until the 17th of this month, and factories in other cities have until the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Easily Exchanged for Indian Cotton, Key Points of the Agreed Upon Measures</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee's Yarn and Cloth Export Committee held a meeting at the National Bank at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Shen Xirui. After discussion, the key points of the resolution on the issue of yarn and cloth exports easily exchanged for Indian cotton are: One-tenth of each factory's yarn and cloth exports can be exchanged for Indian cotton. In order to facilitate foreign exchange accounting, it was decided to ask HSBC, Citibank, and the Bank of China to serve as intermediaries. The export standards of each factory's yarn and cloth must be carefully inspected. The yarn and cloth exported by each factory must first be approved by the Export Committee. In order to handle the approval matters, the Export Committee has set up a business office within the Textile Construction Company to handle the approval matters concurrently. The Central Bank will first advance a sum of funds to purchase Indian cotton and distribute it to each factory to spin yarn and weave cloth, which will be continuously exported and exchanged for cotton.</p>
<h3>China Stocks Weak in the Morning, Rebound at the Close</h3>
<p>News that Chinese stocks would be used to purchase goods imported with private funds caused panic among various sensitive players. Many in the industry wound up their businesses one after another. For the most part, the situation was progressively weakening. The market did not improve in the morning, but later, with the help of rumors of large banknotes, the National Bank intervened, and the low after the rebound rose.</p>
<p>The morning opened with the US and Asia stocks rising sharply. However, the rest of the shares also rose slightly. There were many selling actions after the opening, and the Yongxin Yarn share dropped to 321 yuan and 322 yuan. Although there was a slight increase midway, the interest rate outside the market opened high to 24 cents and 28.5 cents. The Xin Ya share price dropped from 146 to the limit of the decline. After 10:30, it stepped down again to 316 yuan and 318 yuan. Following this, it dropped further to 313 yuan for immediate delivery and 315 yuan for forward delivery. Nos. 24 and 76 stock were purchased at the close, and Yongxin Yarn shares closed at 315 yuan and 317 yuan. It was slightly weak after the close. As a result, in comparison with previous closing price, Xin Ya shares fell to the limit of its decline, Zhabei fell by half, Huochai and Zhongfa fell by 10 percent. Yongxin, Meiya, Liangfu, Xinhua, Lihua, Lianan, Rongfeng and Tongyi fell by half, Xinyi rose slightly and the remaining fell slightly. Looking at deferred delivery shares, Xinyi and Huasheng were slightly firmer, Yongxin, Meiya, Xinguang and Jingfu each fell by half.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, only immediate delivery transactions took place. Yongxin shares were first sold to 311 yuan, but Meiya was strongly supported by No. 4 etc., and the price was quickly raised. There were many suppliers of Yongxin shares, pushing the price down to 310 yuan. Subsequently, the National Bank's exchange situation spread around and was erratic. When the National Bank only intervened with more than 20 billion, public sentiment rebounded and rumors of large banknotes drove up buying interest and prices rebounded sharply. Yongxin shares rose to close at 325 yuan. Meiya shares rose even more sharply. Xinyi and the remaining shares also rose to close at high levels. As a result, compared with the closing price in the morning, Yongxin, Xinyi, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, Xinhua, Xinyi, Huaxin, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Huochai, and Xinhua rose slightly, Zhongfang, Cement, Nei Yi, and Hengfeng were flat, Zhongfa, Lianan, and Jinglun rose by half. Meiya, Zhongsi, and Zhabei each rose by 10 percent. The prices of old shares on the market, apart from bank shares, fell back.</p>
<p>Qinxing Shirt and Socks' capital increase has been completed and trading will resume today. Immediate delivery and deferred delivery will be offered at the same time. The trading unit is set at 100,000 shares.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Shares Fall</h3>
<p>The decline in government bonds was slightly stronger yesterday, with the greatest decline in the Unified E bond. Although Room 555 was buying, Room 553 was selling, with a turnover of about 4 million. The Unified C bond opened in the morning at 17,400 yuan, rose from 17,500 yuan, and then decreased to 16,000 yuan before leveling off slightly. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, A and B bonds were lower by 700 yuan, C bonds fell by 900 yuan, Unified D fell by 800 yuan, and Unified E fell by 1,400.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the selling pressure of foreign shares was stronger, with securities firms and foreign firms supplying, and only Guangdong firms were buying slightly. Yisha opened in the morning at 181,000 yuan, and fell from 186,000 yuan to close at 180,000 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Jardine Matheson, Paper, and Steel each fell by half, Yeguang was flat, and the rest all fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Large Pieces of Dried Longan Expensive</h3>
<p>Large pieces of dried longan have been out of stock for two weeks, and the inventory is empty. Yesterday, a small amount of foreign goods opened, and the firms regarded it as a scarce commodity, raising prices by more than 30%. Due to this volatility, the prices of lower-grade goods have also followed closely.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market Is Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was firm and stable because it had been rising for several days in a row, and the guild had stopped trading for one day the day before yesterday to ease the market. The market has now slightly eased, but it is still firm and stable. The guild's allocation of goods and sorting out of 20 medium-grade sand white sugar was initially 1.12 million yuan, and later reduced to 1.1 million yuan. The 36th-term warehouse receipt for 24 rough white sugar was a maximum of 1.16 million yuan and a minimum of 1,100,800 yuan. Shantou Blue was 97 to 8 million yuan, and cotton red was 1 million yuan. Another Xing Diao Blue opened at 945,000 yuan, and the same trade allocated 945,000 yuan, with occasional concessions, and the price was lower. Hainan Red was 1 million yuan, and the high-quality Xinghua white bagged sugar was 1.18 million yuan to 120,000 yuan, and the next grade was 1.08 million yuan. Packaged was 1,050,000 yuan. Xing Red was 1,035,000 yuan, and the next grade was between 1 million yuan and 1.18 million yuan. A total of 1,3400 pieces were traded.</p>

<h3>Review of Chinese Geography Textbook Maps</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhong</p>
<p>(Compiled by Yang Jingxiong and Chu Shaotang, published by Xin Zhong Yu Di Xue She, first edition in September of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947])</p>
<p>Maps are a fundamental tool for geography teaching, which is self-evident. Therefore, today, the publication of maps by Yu Di Xue She (Geographical Society) is flourishing. Moreover, due to the different levels of map readers, the compilation of national maps has been divided into those suitable for universities, high schools, and primary schools to meet the needs.</p>
<p>There are many maps suitable for junior high and primary schools currently available, but very few are well-compiled, which is regrettable. Recently, I saw the Chinese Geography Textbook Maps for primary and secondary schools published by Xin Zhong Yu Di Xue She, compiled by Mr. Yang Jingxiong and Mr. Chu Shaotang. I took the time to read it through and, in my humble opinion, felt that there were many aspects of the map that needed discussion. I will list them below, despite my limited knowledge:</p>
<p>The political map should include as many provincial-level cities as possible, but the current map is missing cities such as Tangshan, Jinzhou, Anshan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Changhua, Chiayi, and Pingtung.</p>
<p>On the topographic map, the name of the "Profile Map from the Guangdong-Guangxi Plain to Taiwan" mistranscribes Xiuguluan Mountain as Touguluan Mountain.</p>
<p>On the topographic map, there is no river connecting the Yangtze River and the Huai River east of Dabie Mountain (except for the canal), but the map shows a river connecting the Yangtze River and the Huai River. I don't know what this means!</p>
<p>The aluminum in Xiuwen, Guiyang, and Kunming, and the magnesite and talc mines in Haicheng and Gaiping are all major resources in our country. They should be included on the mineral map, but the current map omits them.</p>
<p>As for transportation, it is indeed difficult to be completely accurate. The following are some errors on this map:</p>
<p>From Donghai in Jiangsu to Henan, in addition to the Xuzhou-Lanzhou Railway, there is also the Haizheng Highway, which runs from Donghai through Suqian and Xuzhou to Zhengzhou. The highway between Suqian and Xuzhou was completed long ago and has already been seen on the national economic commission's seven-province (Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan) connecting highway route map. Other maps have added this route, but this map still omits it.</p>
<p>From Xiashi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, there are two highways: one runs north to connect the highway between Jiaxing and Changan, and the other runs south to connect the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. This highway was completed before the victory and has been reported in Zhejiang newspapers many times, but it is also missing from this map.</p>
<p>The terminus of the Xiangqian Railway is Lantian, but the map mistakenly marks it as Dajiangkou. See Zhang Jiaji's "Construction of Chinese Railways." Also, the railway between Lengshuitan and Lingling on the Xianggui Railway is missing from the map.</p>
<p>The Lesi Highway between Leshan and Xichang in Sichuan Province is not included, as seen in Jiang Junzhang's "Southwest Economic Geography" and the "Second National Government Yearbook."</p>
<p>The highway between Anlong and Badu in Guizhou Province is missing, as seen in the "Second National Government Yearbook." The highway between Songtao and Tongren in Guizhou is missing.</p>
<p>The highway between Xianfeng and Laifeng in Hubei Province is missing, as seen in the same source.</p>
<p>The Xukun Railway was opened to Qujing in the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], and then reconnected to the Yunnan-Burma Road and extended to Zhanyi, but the terminus of the map is still marked at Qujing. See the "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled by the Ministry of Transportation in April of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946]. Also, the Yunnan-Burma Railway between Kunming and Anning is missing.</p>
<p>The railway between Fenghuang on the Xianggui Railway and Dajian on the Qianjiang River is missing, as seen in the same source and the "Second National Government Yearbook."</p>
<p>The southern section of the Xianggui Railway between Zhennanguan and Ningming is missing, as seen in the "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled by the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>On the Taiwan map, the road from Pingtung to Fangliao only extends to Linbian now, not to Fangliao, as seen in the "Taiwan Transportation No. 1" compiled by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office Transportation Department in the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946].</p>
<p>On the Shanxi Province map, the railway line from Baigui to Jincheng has only completed the Baigui-Changzhi section. The map mistakenly marks the Changzhi-Jincheng section as a completed railway, which is incorrect. See the "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled by the Ministry of Transportation and Zhang Jiaji's "Construction of Chinese Railways."</p>
<p>The railway between Xiaoxie on the Pinghan Railway and Kaifeng is missing, as seen in the same source.</p>
<p>On the Shaanxi Province map, the highway between Ankang and Baihe has been completed, but the map mistakenly marks it as an incomplete road, which is incorrect. See the "Northwest Highway Route Map" in the Shen Bao's local news section.</p>
<p>There is a highway from Tianshui running northwest through Tongwei to Cuijialing. This road, which is part of the Cui Shuang Highway, has been completed for a long time and has been reported in newspapers and magazines many times. Other maps have this line, but this map is still missing it.</p>
<p>The railway between Nencheng and Aigun has been completed for a long time, but this map still marks it as an incomplete railway. See Zhang's "Construction of Chinese Railways."</p>
<p>The Guilin-Sansui Highway is missing from the map, as seen in the "Second National Government Yearbook."</p>
<p>On the Taiwan map, in addition to the line parallel to the railway between Keelung and Taipei, there is another highway that goes around Datun Mountain to Taipei. Other maps have this line, but this map is missing it. See the "Taiwan Statistical Map" compiled by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office Statistics Office. Also, the Pingtung map of the province shows a highway extending to Meihe in the south and connecting to the Taitung Highway. I don't know when this highway was completed, and its basis is also unclear.</p>
<p>On the Taiwan map, there is a railway from Sandiaoling to Shintongkeng, but this map marks the terminus of the railway at Pingxi, east of Qingtongkeng, which is incorrect.</p>
<p>In addition to transportation, I have also found errors in county seats and other aspects, which I will point out to conclude this article.</p>
<p>Wuchang County in Hubei has been moved to Jinkou, but this map is missing it. Tongguan in Shaanxi has been renamed Yaichuan, but this map mistakenly marks it as Tongchuan.</p>
<p>Zhejiang originally had 76 counties, but after the newly established Wencheng County, it should be changed to 77 counties, but the appendix of this map still lists it as 76 counties.</p>
<p>Because the wind direction is parallel to the coastline in the eastern coastal area of Zhejiang, there are fewer opportunities for rainfall in Ningbo. For example, the annual rainfall in Suian in the west reaches 1826 mm, and Jiande reaches 1416 mm, while Beiyushan on the coast is only 1159 mm. It can be seen that the rainfall distribution in Zhejiang has a trend of decreasing from west to east, which is by no means as stated in the appendix, "the rainfall is the heaviest along the coast."</p>
<p>On the Gansu Province map, the Bailong River has a tributary called the Min River near Xigu, which belongs to the Yangtze River system. However, this map only shows its upper and lower reaches and does not show the middle reaches. It also mistakenly marks it as a tributary of the Tao River, which is incorrect. See Li Xudan's "Geographical Observation of the Life in the Upper Reaches of the Bailong River," "Geographical Journal," Volume 8.</p>
<h3>Revised History of the Chinese Constitution</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Written by Chen Ruxuan, published by The World Book Co., priced at 14 National Currency, total 458 pages</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when I was collecting materials and referring to famous constitutional works to compile "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution," I often referred to Mr. Chen Ruxuan's "History of the Chinese Constitution." When I wrote "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution," I believed that after the publication of this work, China could finally enter a constitutional period. Unexpectedly, when "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution" was displayed in the windows of the Zhonghua Book Company, not only was there no hope of holding the National Assembly, originally scheduled for November 12th of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], but the whole of China was already at war.</p>
<p>From then on, what the entire nation strived for was the victory of the war and the liberation of the nation, while political democratization receded to a secondary position. During the war, the government also made great efforts to ensure that politics conformed to the democratic path. For the sake of gathering ideas widely, it established the National Political Council to allow the people's opinions to be heard. However, China could not truly enter a constitutional period until after the victory of the war. Therefore, writings on constitutionalism were ignored by the general public. In particular, Mr. Chen's "History of the Chinese Constitution" and my "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution," when issued in Shanghai, were subjected to inspection by the Japanese military police, who regarded them as banned books and prohibited their sale. Therefore, the first edition was not completely sold out.</p>
<p>After the victory of the war, Chinese politics underwent eight or nine years of evolution, and the historical facts recorded in the book needed to be augmented. I had long wanted to revise and augment "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution" and reissue it, but because I worked in the news industry and wrote editorials for several newspapers, I hardly had time to reorganize the old work. The day before yesterday, Brother Ye Qiuyuan sent me Mr. Chen's "Revised History of the Chinese Constitution," which on the one hand made me feel ashamed, and on the other hand gave me encouragement that I should take the time to reorganize the old work.</p>
<p>The feature of the "Revised History of the Chinese Constitution" lies in its last two chapters: one is the constitutional movement during the war and the opinions of various parties on the draft constitution, which not only explains the relationship between the war and constitutionalism, but also raises the issue of ending party rule, and also records the nationwide movement to study the draft constitution. Finally, the political consultative council's advocacy for the constitution is also collected in this unit. The second is the completion and implementation of the constitution. This chapter can be said to be the constitutional history of the last year. The first section is the final twists and turns in convening the National Assembly. The political consultative council originally scheduled the National Assembly to be held on May 5, but it was postponed because the parties first fought for seats and then refused to submit a list of names. It finally opened on November 15, but the Communist Party and the Democratic League did not participate. The second section is the draft constitution of the political consultative council, which was first submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and amendment. Mr. Chen is a member of the Legislative Yuan and personally participated in the discussion of the draft constitution, so he knows the merits and demerits of the draft constitution of the political consultative council. Therefore, in the third section, the review of the draft constitutional amendment, he put forward many valuable opinions. In particular, he listed the differences between the formal constitution and the draft of the political consultative council to clarify them, which is most clear.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said in the conclusion, "Our country's constitutional movement, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present, for more than 40 years, until January of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], this major law that the whole country has been looking forward to for a century was finally completed and promulgated. The time spent and the effort made can be said to have broken the world record for constitution-making. It was very difficult to obtain, and it must be carefully protected and vigorously implemented. This is why I am happy to see the dawn coming after a long night for the future of constitutionalism in our country." In short, Mr. Chen's "History of the Chinese Constitution" is worth reading. It is specially introduced to readers who care about Chinese constitutionalism. This book is really a must-read. It is of great benefit to understanding the actual situation of Chinese constitutionalism.</p>
<h3>"My Life"</h3>
<p>— Tuan Ni</p>
<p>Author: Chiang Ching-kuo</p>
<p>Publication Date: April, the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947]</p>
<p>Publisher: Qian Feng Publishing House</p>
<p>This is a concrete and realistic account of Mr. Chiang's three-year plan to create and build a new Southern Jiangxi when he served as the Fourth Administrative Commissioner, that is, the scene at the county magistrate meeting of the Fourth Administrative Region, which decided the critical issue of building a new Southern Jiangxi, on July 4th of the 31st year of the Republic [i.e., 1942]. He concentrated all the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of Southern Jiangxi, trained a large number of revolutionary cadres, improved the basic lives of the masses, and led the people to actively participate in the war of resistance. He cited several failed heroes in history and the reasons for their failures. Therefore, he asked everyone to show loyalty to love the country, conscience to love the people, enthusiasm to do things, and dedication to be human beings. More importantly, they need to have the determination to work hard, work stubbornly, work quickly, and work practically, and stand on the people's front with steps, plans, meanings, and purposes to jointly build a new Southern Jiangxi. The new policies he has led and implemented in the past year and a half have achieved remarkable results. However, it is still far from the ideal of the three-year plan. Mr. Chiang encouraged everyone to double their efforts in order to complete the important task of defending the new Southern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>In the past, everything in Southern Jiangxi was backward and corrupt. Some villagers even regarded banditry as a legitimate occupation and farming as a sideline. Murder, arson, gambling, robbery, and drug use became the daily life of some people. Some places did not communicate with the outside world. There were very few scholars. Graduates from elementary school could sit in sedan chairs and become gentry. There were men with braids and women wearing ancient Qing Dynasty costumes. These all showed the extreme conservatism of the local people. The government did not think of reforming it, and it accumulated into a common habit, to the point where it could no longer be remedied. Since these things were all done by people, it can only be changed by a new human force to transform customs. Mr. Chiang is most happy to fight in difficult places, which has finally made the new Southern Jiangxi a model for the whole country today.</p>
<p>The whole book has a total of eighty-five pages, about 40,000 words, all of which are concrete accounts of the administrative meetings of the Fourth Administrative Region, which can be divided into three chapters: Chapter 1: The New China I Hope For: 1. From an old man surnamed Yang on a hospital bed in the affiliated hospital of the medical research institute of Gong County, describing his rapid recovery of health after being treated and the ideal suitability of the surrounding environment, symbolizing a beautiful prospect; 2. Mr. Chiang reported the cause of the sacred war of resistance and the inevitable consequences of victory. Secondly, he analyzed in detail how to build a new Southern Jiangxi. Mr. Chiang believes that the first step is to complete local self-government, and to do it with a selfless attitude. Because only when the country has happiness can the people enjoy happiness; 3. Explain that the great new era must have new cadres with new styles to complete new tasks. Chapter 2: Revolutionary Work and Revolutionary Cadres: 1. Explain the difficulties in all aspects and ask everyone to overcome the difficulties and be determined to promote the new policies. At the same time, select and employ new, good, capable revolutionary cadres; 2. Analyze that good cadres must adopt public opinion, relieve people's suffering, accept criticism, and also use organization to train others in order to be called revolutionary warriors; 3. Ask everyone to celebrate the new tasks from today onwards and complete this plan. Chapter 3: New Cause, New Mission: After the work reports of the county magistrates, Mr. Chiang further instructed nine guidelines for administration. Secondly, he also reviewed the shortcomings of both the commissioner's office and the county government, hoping that everyone would have the courage to correct their mistakes, and also pointed out four internal crises that needed to be completely eliminated. Finally, Mr. Chiang put forward the central topic of this meeting, hoping that everyone would start a thorough discussion. This meeting had a truly decisive impact on the success or failure of building a new Southern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>In the two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, the flames of war have not been extinguished, poverty has not been relieved, and the people's mentality has instead formed a loose phenomenon. The enemy and puppet habits have not decreased slightly. The future is worth worrying about. Every one of our Chinese people should think of saving the country. Only by emulating Mr. Chiang's revolutionary life is it true that "things are done by people." It is people who do bad things, and it is also people who do good things. In everything, as long as we rely on determination, perseverance, and enterprising spirit, there is no reason why we cannot do well.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Autumn Colors on the Lakeside"</h3>
<p>— Lin Yuwen</p>
<p>Author: Wang Pingling</p>
<p>Publisher: The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Price: 4 National Currency</p>
<p>During the war, there was a thriving literary scene, but today it is still a desolate ruin. This is naturally because life has been difficult due to the unsettled post-war period and frequent internal conflicts, which has led to a loss of writing interest among writers. Therefore, there are no decent works in the publishing world to fill the emptiness of the literary world and satisfy the readers' desires.</p>
<p>Fortunately, two years later, I read a collection of works full of skill - "Autumn Colors on the Lakeside." Because this book is by the hand of an old writer, Wang Pingling, who has been engaged in literature for more than 20 years, it is as if it is right for him to raise his works to the level of "Autumn Colors on the Lakeside," and it is not a shocking event in the literary world.</p>
<p>"Autumn Colors on the Lakeside" includes a novella and eight carefully constructed short stories. There are works that select historical themes and appropriately reflect reality: for example, "The Unmatched National Scholar" is the most familiar story of Xiao He chasing Han Xin. The author writes vividly about the scene of Liu and Xiang fighting, and gives new perspectives, depicting a group of strong men who have contributed and fought for Duke Pei, and who are unwilling to participate in the infighting between Liu and Xiang after Qin has been destroyed, adding to the suffering of the people. This meaning is quite profound. "New Pavilion Tears" uses the historical fact that Emperor Yuan of Jin called on social elites to resist the war and build the country. At that time, those heroes and chivalrous men with a heart of loyalty and a sincere heart of mutual assistance are all alive on paper, writing the situation at that time truthfully, giving an educational contrast to the figures on the political stage today.</p>
<p>There are three articles that use the themes of modern history: "Alas! Twelve O'Clock!" describes the decline of the Japanese Hitler - Nakano Seigō. Fortunately, this guy did not get hold of the Japanese regime, otherwise, today's geography and future history would have to be completely changed. In this short article, the author finds the ultimate cause of the disastrous defeat for the Japanese invaders, and captures a tragic copy for the ambitious warmongers. The two articles "Lu Yuan Bright Moon Night" and "Acting" write about the pitiful history of treacherous people who survived under the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders, enough to make the bandits who intend to betray the interests of the nation sweat.</p>
<p>As the representative of this anthology, "Autumn Colors on the Lakeside", the story takes place in the autumn of the war in West Lake. Those shameless traitors fantasized about gathering countless pure and innocent children, pretending to line up to welcome them, taking various shots, and declaring to the world, in order to prove that the enemy invaders were "loving the people like their own children." They never thought that the children of the next generation had already marked an era with themselves. The children shouted: "We are Chinese, not the sons of traitors!" The traitors tried their best to use their sons as tools to please their masters, but they could not succeed. In the end, this group of children, on the lakeside dyed by the setting sun, shone the autumn grass like blood and the lake red, made sacrifices for the Chinese nation. With the utmost reverence, the author painted with blood and tears, not forgetting a word, erected a glorious tombstone for the martyred children, allowing us to vaguely imagine the tragic tragedy of that year. Without a doubt, it is fulfilling the responsibility that a literary worker should fulfill!</p>
<p>The author also sympathizes with the poor, helpless, and unyielding writers in the chaos with great emotion, as if he were speaking from personal experience, and wrote two successful works, "A Corner of Zhuanqing" and "Entering the City." I read it in one breath, and felt a heavy sense of oppression in my heart. He used skilled techniques to draw two opposing sides for the readers, one side is working hard, and the other is obscene and shameless, one side is heaven, and the other is hell; but those who live in heaven are evil demons, while those who are cruelly beaten into the eighteenth layer of hell are saints who are martyred.</p>
<p>The novella is special, somewhat like the story of Deng TieMei and Miao KeXiu organizing the volunteer army in Northeast China; but it is not entirely true, and the author has melted it and incorporated new materials. The whole chapter is divided into six chapters. In this article, there is a group of stateless migrants who would rather use their own blood to forge a new national soul of independence and freedom. Although they fell one after another under the oppression of the invaders, their immortal spirits are the symbol of China's victory and revival.</p>
<p>In short, in this collection of books, the author has used refined and mature artistic skills that are profound and easy to understand, and deep and detailed thinking, to write down the major historical events of the past eight years, which can be used for historical research by historians, and for contemporary and future generations to linger and watch, to look up and down and mourn. At the same time, he has also captured the grand scenes of the past eight years, the admirable and tearful living patterns, and the hateful and ugly mouths of the people, captured them in the lens, vividly shaped them, with blood and flesh, and screened them in front of the readers.</p>
