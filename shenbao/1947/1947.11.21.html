<h3>一個和美蘇意見的建議</h3>
<p>我國政府爲打開美蘇問的僵局起見，特於十七日照會美英蘇三國，對於召開對日和約預備會議一項問題，提出下列建議：一，由遠東委員會會員國組成對日和約預備會議，該會議應由中英美蘇從早商定日期，予以召開，籍以草擬和平條約，並商決與召開最後和平會議有關事項：二，該項會議之表決，以該會談全體會員國之多數爲之，過去所提爲三分之二多數，現則爲過半數之多數，但在該項多數內須包括中英美蘇四國之同意票。此項建議已由行政院新聞局公佈，美國國務院也已在研究中。很顯然的，我國政府的提議，是爲了調和美蘇的意見，故在尊重美蘇意見和尊重其他八國地位的意義上，此項建議實爲合理的具有建設件的方案，値得盟國的重視。</p>
<p>訂立和約，是在交戰國之問恢復和平關係應有的步驟。歷史上每一次國際戰爭結束之後，必繼之以一個和約的訂立，很少有例外的情事。第二次世界大戰結東已兩年多，而對德對日的和約，尙未締結，戰勝國感到和約的迫切需要，戰敗國更感覺到無和約的惶恐。因此，無論是對德和約也好，或對日和約也好，戰勝國都應該及早商訂。原則上必須這樣做，不應有多大的問題；問題僅在於如何訂？何地訂？以及由那幾個國家作主體？關於這些問題，美蘇兩國意見分歧，甚至與波茨坦會議莫斯科會議的決定也脫了節，這說明了少數幷不尊重多數，强權政治幷不尊重公衆意志。爲大戰成果的獲得着想，爲建立世界和平的前途着想，這對於戰勝國是一個極大的不幸。</p>
<p>我國對於對日訂立和約，希望早日商談，早日締結，是始終一貫的。對日和約爲我抗戰之最後一章，關係我國家及遠東和平，實在太大了，我們應該表示任何合理的願望。今年八月間美國曾提議召開和約初步會議，我國卽報以歡迎的態度；但美蘇爲了程序問題與否決權問題，發生爭執，幾陷於僵局：我國卽處於超然的立塲，調和雙方意見。甚至我國提出不參加無蘇聯之對日和會的警吿；我國珍視遠東十一國對日作戰的成就，亦爲對遠東委員會必須完成之最後使命寄予期望。我國政府基於這種情緒，和尊重公衆的立塲，所以本月十七日有新方案的提出，這個方案內容雖是美蘇意見的折衷，兩大分歧的調和，然其光明磊落的態度，實應値得盟國的重視。我們輿論界贊同這個提議，幷願說明其意義如下：</p>
<p>第一，對日和約預備會議，我國主張由遠東委員會所有會員國組成之，此與美國提議召開遠東十一國對日和約初步會議的主張相接近。按之遠東委員會之組織，係根據莫斯科外長會議的決定，「以履行波茨坦宣言之意志，實施投降條款，並建立國際安全與安定爲目的」遠東委員會的任何決定，必須十一國共同同意。對日和約爲對日作戰之最後一章，亦爲遠東委員會之最後一章，故和約預備會議由遠東委員會會員國組成，幷完成正式和會有關事項，這是無可懷疑的事。但和會日期地點及和約內容，由中英美蘇四國商定。此與蘇聯主張對日和約由四强商訂相接近。</p>
<p>第二，關於和會的表決制，美國注重在「多數」之爭取，蘇聯注重在「否決權」的維護。英國坎伯拉會議對於三分之二表決制，也表示贊同。我國主張表決以過半數爲之，惟在多數中，必須包括中英美蘇四國同意票在內，無異於贊成蘇聯維持否決權的主張。</p>
<p>總之，對日和約應該早日完成，對日和會不應再拖延。這次我國政府的提議，在原則上爭取了外交的主動，現既經提出主張，尤應把提時機，努力貫澈，促其實現。在時機上，這個提議適於倫敦四國外長會議期間提出，這說明了對日和約程序問題雖已陷入僵局，仍然是有路可走，中國的建議富有妥協性，應該作爲美蘇的外交折衷方案，如果美蘇願意互忍互讓，覓求妥協途徑，則我國的建議無疑是含有建設性的方案。希望美蘇兩國冷靜考慮，爲訂立對日和約的成功，亟起圖之！</p>

<h3>四聯放款利率政策不變徐柏園發表談話低利政策缺陷決於補救</h3>
<p>（本報南京廿日電〕四聯總處秘書長徐相園，二十日午後招待記者，發表對調整利率之意見，及辦法宣布四聯對現行放款利率政策暫不變更，談話全文如次：　四聯總處自二十八年改組以來，核辦國家行局放款，向採低利政策，其所依據之理由，至爲　明，一則在抗戰期問後方需要自給，物　需要安定，國家行局對於國計民生所必備之生　事業，自應以低利方式，予以資金之協助，减輕具負擔，鼓勵其增產，國家行局　息雖薄，而於國計民生，究多裨，査考過去各種工礦貸款，農業貸款，糧　貸款等等，均可證明者。二則國家行局貸款中，大部份與政府財政負擔，及經濟政策有直接關係，如提高貸款利率，即直接增加政府支出，或直接與平價政策相抵觸，例如政府機關以預算作抵之貸款，利率提高，即不免增加其負担，又如協助平價物品產銷之貸款，利息愈高，定價必愈昂，如採行高利，與政策原旨不　違背，又如若干種公用事業，其定價取債，均受限制，低利政策，正所以减輕事業之負担，維持其限價，其利益則爲　地市民所共同享受者也，又如協助出口物資生產　銷之貸款，目的在爭取外匯補充基金，有時政府日本惜予以補貼，或負担其匯兌上虧耗，倘貸款又採高利，未免自相矛盾，其他如若干種農業改良及增產貸款，水利貸款，合作生產貸款，及有關文化教育之貸款－如歷年舉辦之中小學敎科　　印貸款－等等，過去施行低利政策，實國家行局爲國家社會忠誠服務之具體表現也。</p>
<p>國家行局貸歐，原則上維持低利政策，但利率亦已逐漸提高，廿九年以前，各項貸款利率，平均爲月息一分以下，民國卅一年以前，鮮右超過月息二分以上者，嗣後漸漸增高，但勝利以前，仍鮮有超過月息三分六厘以上者，復員以來，金融市塲，變化領繁，銀根時鬆時緊，物價漲跌幅度增鉅，利率一致趨漲，月前國家行局放款利率，平均在月息五分左右。</p>
<p>國家行局放款利率，遠較市塲利率爲低，勝利以前，後方市塲利率，約月息大一分强，復員以來，節節上漲，最近滬市利率常在月息大二分以上，其他重要都市大致相同，商業行　　以高利吸收存款，復以更高之利率作短期貸款，利率愈高，行莊之利益自然愈厚，惜此種　利環境，必然阻碍正省生產事業之發展，亦必然迫使物價跳　上漲，例如按照月息大二分，每月複息次計算，一年之問，利息成本，使在八倍以上矣。</p>
<p>今日國家行局放款利率，與一般市塲利率，相差過鉅，亦易引起各種流弊，例如：1合於貸款原則，但其出品幷不受物價管制之生產事業，如能貸得款項，或貸款特鉅者，關較其他廠商處於優越之地位，而其出品　價，仍照一般高利計　成本，故低利部份，不　額外之津貼。2因此　易發生貸款拖延不償，或本身資金已相常充裕，或不甚符金規定及邊際以下之生產者，亦不免以種種方法，希圖獲得貸款，因此審核放款申請及考核放款用途，成爲極繁複艱鉅工作，各行局徑辦放款，亦煩　而不易。右列各項爲低利政策下最易發生之缺陷，經一再商榷，僉認爲不久之道，不外就下列二者中擇一施行：1國家行局庫貸款，以嚴格配合國策者爲限，凡不受物價管制自負盈虧之生產事業，雖合乎原訂貸款原則，亦一律不予貸放，而由財政部賣令商業行莊，儘先予以資金之融通。2國家行局庫貸款，採取差別利率辦理，對於完全配合國策之貸款，仍採低利政策，對於前述自負盈虧之生產事業，則參照市塲利率計息，仍應嚴格考核放款之用途及其成效，幷應加强核考査機構之組鐵切實執行。（四聯總處決議不　更放款利率四項原則，刋第七版）</p>

<p>馬氏此行任務與以前四次會議目標相同，即設法與蘇外長莫洛一托夫就奥地利和約成立協議，並至少決定德國和約大綱，但根本問題　在蘇聯與西方各國間關係漸趨緊張一點。蘇聯如果再度阻，法國或將會同英美在德境設立三國共同佔領區。</p>

<p>（路透社成功湖十九白電）阿拉伯國代表之報吿　要點如下：　分治建議與委治原則有　，直接速背國聯及聯合國憲章之原則。　阿拉伯族爲數百年來巴勒斯坦之佔有人，有在該地建國及自決之權。　關於麥克馬翁與赫　尼所交換函件之疑點，應由國際法院解決（函內所述大致爲英國對阿拉伯族之諾言，不能與對猶太族之諾言並立）　貝爾福宣言之合法性及其解釋，應委請國際法院裁定。　國聯實已暫時承認巴勒斯坦之獨立。　國聯解散以後，委治即失其法律上根據，而英國亦已宣布放棄委治之意，故已無使巴勒斯坦成爲獨立國之阻碍。　聯合國機構並不繼承國聯之職權，故不能繼國聯爲委治制之主管者。報吿書且認除非由委治國談商託管協定，則聯大會或聯合國其他機構均無權執行委治地之決議案。報吿書復建議，將巴勒斯坦問題自聯大議程上剔除，並認無論如何，應先獲取國際法庭之意見。報吿書復强調巴勒斯坦之整個或一部份，均不能置於任何外國政府管制之下，聯合國機構必須尊重民族自決原則。</p>

<p>九時前，民衆二十五萬人已充塞街頭，有携踏脚凳者，有　援樹木居高臨下者，數千警察雁列御車必經之途，對此種行爲加以阻止。九時半，兵士出動，遮塞行列。士兵御軍服而不穿禮服。九時方過，貴賓絡繹到達西寺。四英人整夜站立寺外，斯時不支倒地，送急救站醫治。在行送兩側計有急救站三十，人員數千人。</p>

<p>十五日下午八時，劉又赴鳳之廠中，吿貸不遂，且遭識駡。劉當夜返家，輾轉床第，不能成寢，乃於十六日上午，在黃中尋出屠刀一柄，藏於身畔，逕赴久章布廠，因見廠內人衆，不易下手乃在廠前徘徊。</p>
<p>行兇至下午二時半，鳳母　陳氏適由廠內外出遇見，吿以風已偕胞姊阿　赴膠州路南洋烟草公司找尋姊夫曹俊生。劉聞言亟追踪前往，則見兩姊妹閒坐公司門房內，經邀其同往曹俊生家，共進晚膳。至八時許。偕鳳雇三輪車同赴久章布廠，沿途鳳漫　不已，一車至目的地後，鳳即飛步入弄，而劉亦即跟蹤進去，抵轉角處，四顧無人，又黑暗異常，乃出屠刀，用左手扳住金鳳脖子，用刀刺入其左頰，鳳痛極呼救數聲，血如泉湧，　地步起。</p>
<p>夜遁</p>
<p>兇手至此，即棄刀狂奔逸去，至北火車站，因身無分文，當將襯裘白布衫一件出售，得款二萬八千元，至翌晨四時，搭車返常。事後該管江寗繁局得報後，由王分局長飭股長林德銘率警馳往調査，並獲得死者臨死時說出兇犯姓名及身分，承辦員警即追訪兇手之岳母盧陳氏，連襟曹俊生，其兄劉根榮，叔父劉朝天，以及兇手服務之廠中，最後斷定兇手必潛逃鄉間。</p>
<p>就縛</p>
<p>後從曹俊生處探悉劉往常州門外龍虎塘後胡莊忳，乃由代　股員王琦率警趙秉良，於出事之翌晨，帶同曹赴常州，輾轉至上述地點，適兇手在草棚內擁被而睡，束手就擒，乃兼程押解返滬，偵訊罷實，即解地檢處。此案自發生迄破案止，僅費廿四小時云。</p>

<p>據聞冷對張是否具有吿訴人資格一點，首表懷疑，因戶　所載係表叔與姪女關係。庭上據以訊張，則答渠與筱實係同居，至尸籍所載，因須演戲關係，故塡表叔。庭上轉詰冷山，在演「秦淮月」一劇時，有無擁抱七十餘次之多？通信旣係硏究藝術，爲何借用劉瓊信箱？洽答：公演秦淮月時渠本人正在蘇州，張指該劇係其編導亦有錯誤，該劇導演爲應堅，編劇人係劉濤，並提出說明　呈庭作證。至假劉瓊信箱，亦係遵筱所囑，因以前越劇迷寫信給筱，措詞稍有不妥，張即飭人前往毆打，故依筱言辦理。</p>

<h3>初度三峽崆嶺灘怎樣被稱爲鬼門關</h3>
<p>（本報宜昌十二日航訊〕揚子江上三峽風景的佳麗，形勢的險峻，早已震　古今中外，憑一枝秃筆，實在沒法描繪它的神髓於萬一。坐下水船，從重慶出發，得在第二天下午五時光景，方始進入第一峽－瞿塘峽。這峽一名廣溪峽，全峽西起白帝城，東迄巫山縣止。最峽進處的　門，江面　地窄隘，兩岸山岩，壁立千仭，垂直的拔開江面，直　雲霄。靜靜的江流，突然遭到約束，激起萬千風浪。江面上，處處都是一個個急性的漩渦。一路上，儘是懸崖絕壁，非午夜中天，的確不易見到日月。</p>
<p>到巫山縣，天已黑下來，所以欣賞巫山峽的景色，得挨到第二天大淸早。這段自巫山縣起，到宮波口爲止，著名的巫山十二峯，矗峙其間。大江南北，各居其半。船上的水手，如數家珍般的，點出十二峯的名字。什麽望霞，翠屛，朝雲，松　，集仙，聚鶴，凈壇，上昇，起雲，飛鳳，登龍，聖泉等等。看到了一座高峯，馬上還點出它的名字。可是，在陌生的旅客看來，道些峯巒，似更都是孿生兄弟，沒法一一記下。只覺得連峯錯咧峽峙，重嶂疊巖，翳日遮暉。把揚子江拗曲得不像個樣子。</p>
<p>船到巴東，又說是進入西陵峽了，這一段直到宜昌爲止，是三峽中最長的一段，更多的是灘峽，題名新奇，而形勢也最險。舉幾個最著名的，有牛口灘，崆嶺灘，　洞灘，兵花賓劍峽，牛肝馬肺峽，燈影峽等。這中間的崆嶺灘，更是川江船隻最易失事的地點。航行川江的海員，多盛傳着一語：「新　洩灘不是灘，崆嶺　光鬼門關」。</p>
<p>川江航錢，（指自重慶至宜昌間一段的揚子江航程，）比不得海洋，處處都是暗礁，又多的是灘，每年水位，又有深淺的兩個時期。航行時非要有經騐的領江不可。這些領江，得記住川江上每塊灘，每個暗礁的高低大小。在滿佈陷穽的川江上，要如履薄冰般的摸索出一條安全的航路來。現有川江的領江，差不多都是早年航行川江上木船的船老大。他們憑着航行川江幾十年的經騐，做了每條航輸安全的眼綫。</p>
<p>光緒廿六年時，德輸「瑞生」號，試航川江，船上的中國舵夫，在船駛到崆嶺灘時，對準了灘上所峙立着的一塊「對我來」瞧石直開，看樣子，非直撞上礁不可，船上德籍船主忍耐不過，搶過舵來，立刻打轉，那知剛一轉舵，船　已在江底碰了個暗礁，立刻打破下沉這德籍船主，至此方始明瞭那舵夫直望「對我來」一礁直駛，是有他的作用的，於是羞憤拔槍結束了自己的生命。原來，船駛到崆嶺灘時，因爲附近暗礁業業錯列，非得對準「對我來」一礁直駛，直至將近碰礁的時候，才可把舵轉向，船就轉入死裏逃生，唯一的，狹隘的，安全去路。沒到時機，太快轉舵，船就觸礁，所以崆嶺灘得了「鬼門關」的尊稱。多少船隻，在此演了悲劇。川江領江的講起這段軼事來，還會「談虎色變」的。</p>
<p>經過三峽，令人追念到洪荒時代，揚十江是怎樣的跟崑崙山和它的支脈，展開了一頁驚心動魄的搏鬥。結果崑崙的千嚴萬　，終於阻擋不了揚子江的怒濤，在出征五千五百餘公里，流貫九行省後，東流入海。揚子江這般百屈不撓的毅力和精神，該是華夏人民一個警惕的標語，讓我們跟揚子江學習吧！（特派記者胡隆昶）</p>
<h3>中央撥發三億賑濟鹽睢災民</h3>

<h3>競選活動在台灣</h3>
<p>（本報台北十七日航訊）省垣半月來未見放晴，如入雨季，而競選活動，絲毫未受影響，台省選民以智識水準平衡，競選風氣亦頗正常，據總選派來本省之三視導員語記者，本省選民人數甚爲正確，且造送名册遞至總選所，亦爲全國最早，競選方法亦較爲正當。本省八縣九市區域國大候選人，合計六十八人，嗣因蔣主席訓示「戡亂重於競選」，致有部份候選人自動放棄，目下共有六十一人競選，台中·台南以人口衆多，各選女代表一人，台中候選女代表僅　關帖一人，左券可操。台南楊郭杏·陳阿秀·尙須分一高下。一般競選最普通方法，係刊登報紙廣吿，「有志一同」說明詳細經歷，將姓名製成鋅版刊登，以小巧顯目取勝，甚且有寫「新人出現！熱血男子！」嚴如電影宣傳廣吿。地位大小不一，十之八九係以大刀闊斧姿態出現，次爲廣播演講，「XURA」不暇，本省電化敎育發達，此法尙著成效。再次爲招貼幻燈，五光十色，美不勝收，一筆資本化得不小。「憲政協進會」主辦「政見發表演講會」，情緒不以風雨减低。遺憾者爲若干地方竟出現個人之「選舉事務所」，現已由省選所禁止，以免混淆，是亦足見省胞競選之熱誠。台東地雖偏僻，區域候選人竟達九名，爲全省之冠，山地同胞甚多，不能寫漢字，已規定由管理人代書。目前競選空氣頗見緊張，設老天作美，精彩鏡頭紛呈，更可預卜。</p>

<h3>基隆港進入雨季輸出額日見減少</h3>

<p>（本報南京二十日電)敎部對於各級學校課程標準修訂情形，曾迭誌本報，茲將最近動態探誌於下：</p>
<p>小學課程</p>
<p>小學課程標準之修訂，迭經敎部邀集專家會議修訂後，敎部爲集思廣益，精益求精，仍不時與專家接觸，參考意見，並由主管司科與有關人員不斷的研究多次，已將全部小各科課程標準理竣事，正在　印全稿，約於下周中由部內主管方面爲最後之審議，俟呈經部部長核定後，在本年十二月中即可正式公布。聞此項標準，外間往往誤解，以爲課程標準係依據上課之標準，甚實所謂標準者，並非製定課程，僅爲綱要，各地可依此共同使用之標準則，而按　地方環境以訂定適應之踝程。部定標準，僅爲大綱，頗具彈性，並另規定實施辦發，因此不獨內地各省市可以活用，即邊疆各地，乃至華僑各地，皆可根據課程標準原則，以訂適應境境之課程。外界批評三十一年之踝程標準不及二十五年的爲優，因三十一年適在戰期，許多地方，因人才不足，不能自選適宜教材，編訂合乎理想之課程，感覺書荒，敎部不得于課程標準內稍作硬性之規定。此次採取二十五年之精神，並改進之，故新課程標準比較妥善。</p>
<p>中學課程</p>
<p>中學課程標準，前經敎部將中學課程十餘科，分請專家，每科五人至七人，分期在敎部開分科會議，修訂後，又曾通函請各專家簽註意見，敎部收到專家寄回意見，仍在繼續不斷的整理之中。　於十二月十日以前整理完畢，再分請實際從事中學敎育人員，與各科專家每科一二人，作一次綜合會議，以爲最後決定。全部課程，可能于年內或明正核定，正式公布。</p>
<p>大學課程</p>
<p>大學各學院課程綱要，最初本有加以整理修訂之意，嗣因顧　時間，經濟，師資各項問題，原有課程暫行仍舊。本年內聞不召築專家會議修訂，明年再視情形酌辦。</p>

<h3>四聯總處理事會決定現行放款利率不變　非必要的放款將一概停辦</h3>
<p>本報南京二十電〕四聯總處昨日上午九時舉行第三五七次理事會議，由張副主席羣代理主席，會中通過要案多起。下午二時徐秘書長柏蘭招待記者，即席答覆各記者所詢問題甚多。茲探誌其要　如下：一，近兩個月來輸出超過輸人，貿易情形漸已轉佳。二，外匯平準基金委員會改組消息，純係一般謠傳。三，關於現行放款利率，經四繼處本屆理事會商討後，暫不變更，並決定下列原則四項：</p>
<p>甲，調整利率主要目的，原爲避免非必要之放款與緊縮信出，惟調整利率一事，有利有弊，故尙須愼重考慮。</p>
<p>乙，緊縮信用，衡量目前前濟環境，對若千非十分必要之放款，似應一槪停辦。</p>
<p>丙，有關國計民生與國營及民營生產遝銷與交通公用事業，似應斟酌實際需要，作有計劃之分配，由國家行局貸助。詳細方案，定本年內擬定完成。</p>
<p>丁，關於行政機關及公營事業，存匯款之控制，頃財部洽商審計部規定嚴格考核與懲處辦法，切實執行。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕國行吸收之同業存款，迄今已有一千餘億元。該存款利息八分，十天爲期，有款以一億爲單位。外傳將提高利率說。該行方面表示。目前並無變更之必要云。</p>
<h3>消滅黑匯三種辦法</h3>
<p>本報南京二十日電〕財次兼四聯總處秘書長徐柏，二十日午後於答覆記者關於財政金融詢問時稱：兩閱月來，出口結匯情形，顯有進步。政府所收外匯，超出其所支出者，數目雖不甚大，然收多於支，則係實情。目前掛牌市價與黑市價問有一距離，僑匯未能多多吸收，此亦原因之一。如何改善匯率，吸收外匯，財部及國行極爲重視，此種情形，最近可望改善。以言當前外匯政策，當不出提高脾價，與壓低黑市兩途。就後者言，黑市爲違法行爲，政府如下決心，事實上可望將黑市壓低。據渠個人看法，欲謀平抑，不外三法。　嚴格禁絕走私，使市塲無黑市外匯需要。　嚴格査究金鈔非法買賣，不准其隨意提高。　對正常外匯需要，按時作必要之供應。三者若能作到，則政府對外匯即可控制。</p>
<h3>側面估計法幣數額</h3>
<p>記者請徐氏發表我當前法幣發行數字，徐側面作答稱：蒲立特近謂有二億五千萬美元即可將法幣全數收回。此二億五千萬，若按黑市計算，則用以收回目前發行額，綽綽有餘。即以官價計算，相距亦不甚遠。我發行若予公布，若干人士必難置信。有人主張公布發行額，其理由即在於此。一部份人認國家本年支出不滿五十萬億，引以爲異。而財部則認支出有卅萬億，已感困難。可見一般印象，與事實不盡相符。徐氏對四行兩局一庫歸併案，亦談及。認此事値得硏究，惟目前實行，困難棊多，故未肯作定論</p>
<h3>放寬尺度礙難允准</h3>
<p>徐又答覆兩項與上海有關詢問。　當日票據抵用問題，財部正硏究中。不久可發表。　各商行要求國行放寬轉抵押尺度，政府現正設法緊縮信用，此點礙難允准。此事關鍵不在尺度實狄，而視用途如何。</p>
<h3>四聯分處加強機構</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕四聯總處秘書長徐柏國廿日宣佈，四聯總處爲加强控制市塲金融，決將該處在滬所設機構，予以改組，並加强其組織，俾對當地國家行局各種業務，隨時處於督導聯繫地位。並決定請國行張總裁就近負指揮督導之職。</p>
<p>徐氏並宣佈，四聯總處自本年七月起，曾會同各行局組織貸款巡迥稽核團，先後査核者有工廠百餘家，包括十餘種行業。根據調査報吿，各行局所放資金，其應用皆尙確當。</p>
<p>又四聯總處核定放款，咸按規章，政府機關或民意機構，如欲明瞭國家行局辦埋放款情形，可隨時査看。</p>
<h3>平衡會負責人談外匯調整策略推動出口爭取僑匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕邇近盛傳外匯政策將有所更變，外匯平衡基金委員會亦有改組之說，記者昨特趨訪外匯平衡基金委會嚴高負責人，據其談稱：改組外匯平術基金委員會之說，彼未有所聞，並一再强調，數月來基金委員會之外匯收支已能平衡，外匯政策亦無更變必要，至於提高外匯牌價旨在推動出口，爭取僑匯，與减少進口商過份利潤，因國內物價與黑市外匯逐日高漲，進口商取得廉價外匯之進口貨物，而售之市塲獲利不資，僑匯亦羣趨高價之黑市，故外匯必需隨時調整，以改善之，但決非跟隨黑市也，並答覆記者各項問題：　近日黑市外匯之高漲，由於北方逃避資金南湧，扒吸黑市外匯所致。吸收此項游資自爲治本之道　停止結購遠期外匯，使進口商無法囤積圖利，且政府售出外匯，能收收縮通貨之效，結購遠期外匯，則須延遲三個月付款，失去收縮通貨之效。　外匯平衡基金委員會，不能供給已核准之外體頭寸之說，全塲無稽。一萬二千元之官價外匯向由政府供給，與平衡基金委員會無涉。　出口貿易形勢並不悲觀，山東收復後，花生出口爲數必甚可觀。　自由外匯政策，在經濟學理上尙無不合，然目前我國環境實不許可，若政府放棄管制，如市塲稍有流言，則已不堪設想。　關於美國貸款，渠認爲中國雖亟需外援，然在貸款之前亦需顧到他日歸還之時，况貸款與否需取決美美國國會，我人徒虛冀求，於事毫無補益也。</p>
<h3>統債回升外股平庸</h3>

<p>外股昨見新高價後，漸轉盤旋，怡紗晟開三一〇七〇〇〇元，自三〇九〇〇〇元退至三〇五〇〇〇元而後轉平，英聯自四三萬退至四二萬左右，廣帮有貿，外商及證券帮則出。結果較前收計業廣跌半成，詳泰再漲一成，紙版尙平，怡紗航榮鋼業微降，英聯會得豐祥泰怡啤微升。</p>

<p>午後</p>
<p>聞證金有不能核減之訊，永鈔自即交三五二元，遞交三六四元開後，曾退至三四七元及三五八元低價。二三號等均進，塲外仍高，即回升至三六一元及三七三元。九四號等逢高有供，稍有掙扎。三二號等力購，國行交換差出，三〇號等進即交，乃漲到即交三六四元，遞交三七五元新高價。一五六號等力售即交，一八六號等出遞交，跌至即交三五五元，遞交三六七元。經一一六號等之吸收，</p>
<h3>承上日漲風餘威棉紗喊價步升　獲利多頭出籠布疋回降</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市況，最開以經簡人員蒞塲監事，同業均不敢活躍，惟塲外市勢，因美匯又予提高，人心激昂，喊盤步揚，形勢頗見紊亂。迨至收市，脚地似稍回軟，但結果四二支藍鳳細紗繼續飛騰二百卅萬，爲四千六百五十萬。二十支雙馬紗亦步跳八十萬，每件相近三千萬元其他各支粗細紗，亦均再創空前之高峰。棉布市况，初開承隔日收盤之銳氣，各布再創新紀錄。十二磅龍頭細布哄至一百卅一萬之頂峯，旋因業中人居高思危，一般獲利者相繼出籠，又遇經濟警察蒞塲監視，市勢頓吿回降。最後收，價爲一百廿六萬五千元，比上日回瀉二萬五千元。其他各檔細布亦均回低一二萬元。惟振中獨好六萬元，高檔士林布以染料迭漲步升五萬至十萬左右。其餘各布互有一二萬至六七萬之升沉。昨日現棉市况，承上日漲風，各檔一致挺升，紗廠紛起扒吸，同業互相抵補，市况空前高峯。終以浮多逢高吐售，漲勢稍平，結果較上日挺升三千萬左右，全日成交一九〇〇包。送廠價做開令賽五一六萬，漢細四〇五萬，沙市五〇一萬八千，巴西五三〇萬八千，涇陽五二五萬七千，河口四八七萬八千，成交八四〇包。棧交價做開靈四九六萬，漢細四五八萬八千，海提尖三四七萬二千，洛陽四四六萬四千，北太三六三萬八千，火機三二二萬，成交一〇六〇包，周浦籽花七九萬。</p>

<p>華股昨塲外始終高過塲內，新買集團繼續進取，賣方氣燄無形被壓低，易升難降，永紗再見新高價收市又升至三六〇元及三七〇元。結果較晟收即交股計中法景福永公景輸火柴統益漲半成左右，餘均小升。遞交一致微漲，塲外各老股銀行股再跳半成强，文化股仍穩，餘者平和而已。</p>
<p>現遞</p>

<h3>中信局人絲到滬下週開始配售</h3>

<h3>觀音粉</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>大戰後的我國，除了江浙數省的百姓，當能勉强維持生活，尤其是上海南京蘇州杭州等地，交通便利，民智較開通，求生能力較强的區域，依然繁華消費外，如果你們到了窮鄉偏僻的地帶或深入天災乒禍連綿的省份，往往有些衣不被體骨瘦如柴的一羣難民，在食草根樹皮，竟有連草根樹皮都已搜括得一乾二凈，在那裏地下開掘白陶土來果腹。他們稱做觀音粉。</p>
<p>觀昔粉，是一種黏滑性細細賊的泥土。成分是氫氧化矽鹽或含鋁鐵鈣鎂等。具有脂肪狀的性狀，並且有一種滋味。考之各國文獻，南洋茶一島的土人，南美奥尼科河畔的一種民族，非洲的黑種民族，也有吃泥土的記載。這種所謂觀昔粉的黏土，外觀呈乳脂狀的白色所以從前德國芬蘭等處，也有人好奇把他塗在麵包上吃過。但在醫學上講起來，吃泥土，當然絕對沒有營養價値，而對於飢餓的百姓們，完全是用來果腹充飢，那就是說除掉他們五臟殿翻身的餓感罷了。一九二三年德國Puchner氏也曾記載過荒山絕頂的獸類狼鹿等在餓得不了的時候，也能爬取白陶土來充饑的。</p>
<p>講到白陶土，在藥用上，却有許多妙用。從前有許多他方，當新醫藥尙未發展到的鄉問，遇到雅片中毒的病人，用白陶土來吸收胃腸中的毒素，大約因其能阻止腸管的迅速吸收機能和帮助毒質的排出。同時也可以用來治泄瀉，痢疾，蟲痢等。這方法到現在我們有時還在使用。Sandeith氏記載埃及土人，用尼羅河下的黏土和檸檬汁同食，用來治療孕婦的嘔吐。</p>
<p>再溯考上古時代，西洋有名的醫家伽倫氏，也曾研究某島的黏土的療病效能。後來一度失却這種信仰。直到前世紀的末葉，即一八九八年時有落羅氏始再承認白黏土白陶土的治病價値。提倡對於吐瀉或翟亂的奇效。至今醫家尙有用白陶土來治胃腸病的。例如用氢氣化鋁粉治療胃潰瘍時能掩蔽胃黏膜的破損面面减少胃酸的刺激性疼痛。氫氣化矽酸臨類，用以吸着腸內的細菌產物的毒素和糞便中的蛋白分解毒素而减少其毒作用。又因這些泥土，不受腸管的吸收，可以帮助通便的作用。照這樣看來，觀音粉的泥土，又不能說是絕對無用之物了。</p>

<h3>女子性器的出血</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>吾爲甚麼要用這樣的標題？因爲常常遇到來就診的女子，她對於性器方面有血液流出來的話，總是認做月經的。其實月經和性器的出血，是兩件事情；雖然月經的出血，也是從十宮方面流出來的；但是這樣的出血，是屬於女子生理方面的事情，而且每月週而復始，有一定的規律。女子除了這樣所講的正式有規律的月經以外，如果在性器方面有血液流出來的時候，那就呌做出血。吾爲什麽要把月經和出血的分別，來吿訴大家呢！因爲月經是女子正常的事情，醫學上呌做生理的事情；出血是不應當有的事情，醫學上呌做病理的事情。一般不明瞭月經與出血的女子，常以病理的出血，繼誤到月經上面去，不但得不到合理的醫治，竟有因此遷延醫治的時日，義羅道患，後悔莫及。</p>
<p>那末可以引起女子性器出血的原因，究竟有那幾種呢！說來話長，吾只好把簡單而最多遭過的疾病，來解說一下；外陰部的潰瘍，裂傷，險道的潰瘍，陰道炎，陰道壁的裂傷，子宮腔部糜爛等，在這樣的時候，因爲組織潰爛發炎的關係，常常有血液流出，尤以在勞動，房事等的時候，出血較多。如果病人自已不淦意的話，誤以爲月經，豈非牛頭不對馬嘴，失去了正確的醫治。此外子宮粘膜的茸腫，子宮內膜炎，子宮筋腫，子宮位置不正等的時候，她的出血，常常和月經同來，引起月經血量的增加和時間的延長，竟有十天半月還不停止，或則十天十五天出血一次，病者也多誤以爲月經，最重要的，就是癌腫，在四十歲以後的女子，經血忽然增加，或則閉經期後以後的女子，月經復來，俗呌做「倒開花」的，其實牠並不是月經，是因爲十宮或陰這方面發生痛腫出血的緣故，筆者曾有一篇「可怕的子宮癌腫」一文，載在本刋。癌腫是應當早期治療的，失去了時機，就沒有挽救的希望。還有急性喇叭管炎，卵巢腫瘍，卵巢機能障碍等，也可以引起出血的。</p>
<p>以上是關於婦科方面的出血，關於產科方面的出血，例如受孕一二個月的分產，在沒有經騐的婦人，也有誤以爲月經的，如果流產後的遺留物，不完全排除的話，引起流產後子宮內膜炎，出血淋漓不止，白帶淫淫，下　疼痛，甚至影響全身，面黃肌瘦，操作無力，還有一種呌做子宮外孕的，孕卵不發育在子宮裏面，徧徧生在子宮以外的部份，最多的是喇叭管妊娠，喇叭管是一稱織小的管，不能容受遂時漲大的孕卵，就要破裂起來，除下腹部疼痛和內出血以外，同時還有子宮出血，病者不察，有誤以爲痛經的事情。</p>
<p>以上把婦科和產科方面出血的病症，略爲解說，希望讀者把月經和出血，認爲兩事，同時遇到不正常出血的時候，應當探就病原，急速醫治才好。</p>
<h3>關於維他命（續）</h3>
<p>— 尹集廷</p>
<p>在十年來的現代科學中，恐怕沒有更比維他命最能吸引人的注意了，報章雜誌的資吿上注目皆是，已成了人們所追求的時代寵兒。牠和生命有密切的關係，誰又不想健康咧；再加上藥商們的宣傳，多少人被引入竅中，糊里糊的濫用維他命了。</p>
<p>維他命的出世，遠在十九世紀便有了孕育，一八八〇年俄國化學家洛氏（Lunin），在巴塞大學生理學系工作時以酪素脂肪和蔗糖的混合物飼養老鼠，結果短期而逝，單以奶粉飼之反能活到更長的時問，他以爲牛奶中除了已知的要素外，一定還有其他的要素，而這種未知的要素，一定也是人類生活所不可缺少的東西，一八九七年荷蘭伊氏（Eijkman）爲爪哇監獄醫官時，見獄中之鷄飼以犯人所剩的熟白米飯，日久即患癱瘓，死後檢査，並無足以致死的細菌，旣非傳染病，遂轉）而注意食物的變異，以家禽試之，初發多發性神經炎，繼亦癱瘓而死，其後馬來半島佛氏Fraser）與斯氏（Staiten）繼試於人類，亦得同樣結果，於是理由大白，始知食物巾除了蛋白質，脂肪和炭水化合物之外，尙含生命不可缺少的要素，直至一九一一年荷蘭化學家芬氏（Funk）始命名這種要素而爲「維他命」，近三十年來，經科學家的繼續硏究，維他命的新發現，新知識，如雨後春笋般層出不窮的出現了。（未完）</p>

<h3>吳爾富獎金得者猶太作家阿胥</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>安尼斯費爾德吳爾富獎金是美國愛迭絲（Sdith　Anislield　Wolf）女士設立來紀念她的父親安尼斯費爾德（JohnAnisfield）和她的丈夫吳爾富（EigeneE．Wolf）。該獎金開始於九三四年，被選者獎美金一千元。今年獎金爲猶太作家阿胥（Sholem　Asch）所得。得獎作是「柬流」（East　River）。評語大意云：「東流是文藝傑作。它不但是小說中最好的作品，並且非常敏感，同情，有深刻的分析。我們看到猶太人與非猶太人，天主敎與基督新敎，僱主與工人的緊張關係，並且正統與新思想，嚴正與寬弛，自由與保守也寫在裏面。通過一切，而又勝利地超過一切的是一切人類的基本情感。」</p>
<p>阿胥的作品大都在僕特來姆公司（G．P．Putnam’s　Sons）出版，除「東流」外，尙有「使徒」（The　Apostle，1943）「阿伯拉罕的孩子們」（Chlidrenof　Abraham，1942）「命運」（OneDestiny「山谷之歌」（SongoftheValley，1938）「拉薩勒人（TheNazarenerene　1939）「母親」（TheMother　1925）「吾所信」（WhatiRelieve，1947）「小說三種」（Three　Novsls，1938內收「摩西舅舅」Uncle　Moses「李德理回家」C海面Lederer’</p>
<p>Return和「不審判」Judge　Not）「開始的時候」（IntheBeginning1923）「竊賊莫特克」（Mottke　the　Thief，1916）「拯救」（Salvanon’1934）「三城」（Turee　Citer，1933）等。</p>
<p>今年普利支獎金（PulitzerPrize）小說獎贈與華倫（Robert，Penn　Warren）的「一切國王的人」（All　the　King’s　Men），詩歌獎贈與羅威爾（RobertLowell）的「魏萊公的古堡」（Lord　Weary’s　Castle）。但有不少刋物編輯主張這次普利支小說獎贈予「東流」的作者猶太阿胥。</p>
<p>阿胥不僅寫長篇小說，也寫短篇小說和戲劇。他在一八八〇年生於波蘭的一個小城庫特諾（Kutno），當時是俄國的屬地，阿胥是一個小商人家庭中的第十個孩子。十九歲時他到華薩去。他在學校所受的有限的敎育不過是古今希伯來的語言與文學。他從母親那兒取得細膩的浪漫思想，從父親那兒取得自信。他把小城的生活速寫下來，帶到華薩，第二年就出版，一九〇四年他寫了不少抒情散文，出了一本「小城」（Dos　Shtetl，1905）。這種半牧歌式的猶太小城生活的描寫代表一種浪漫的寫實主義，離開史福里姆（MendeleMocherSforim）和別的猶太老作家的寫實主義——惟新猶太的浪漫主義之父潘萊士（Y．L，Perez）是例外。一九〇六年他寫抒情劇「在梅喜的日子」（MoshiakhsTeauth），一九〇七年又出「復仇之神」（DerGotFunNekome），接着又寫了不少的戲劇。這些戲劇不僅在歐美的猶太劇演出出，還在俄國和波瀾的舞臺上演出，連德國萊因哈特在柏林舞台也演他的戲。從此猶太文學纔爲全世界所認識。阿胥的小說和戲劇被譯成俄文德文波蘭文英文以及各國的語言。他的新鮮，幽默，溫暖都是使人歡迎的原因。</p>
<p>第一次大戰開始時，阿胥纔寫小說，他從竊賊，地下室的人物一直寫到革命領袖，殉道者和聖人。他所寫的人物都是内心鬥爭而求解放的戰士。例如「復仇之神」便寫的是一羣犯罪的人，靈魂爭鬥，終於從上帝那兒得到力量。</p>
<p>阿胥最豐富的小說是三部曲「三城」（FarnMabb，1927－1932）。「拯救」（Der　TilimYid），把作者早期小說的主題一古腦兒都放在裏面。「拉薩勒人」（Der　Man　Fun　Nitseres）是「拯救」的續編，以古代猶太爲背景，寫基督敎建立的傳說。「使徒」只有英文譯本說的是聖保羅的生活。</p>
<p>一九三二年阿胥被舉爲猶太年會的名譽主席。一九三七年紐約猶太敎會贈給他希伯來文學博士的學位。</p>

<h3>都市篇</h3>
<p>— 茵培</p>
<p>江湖哲學家</p>
<p>十字街頭，有一位江湖哲學家，他有一塊很漂亮的招牌，上面寫着：——善觀氣色，能知過去未來。……</p>
<p>於是，人們相信了他，圍着他站了一個圈子；聽他巧妙地解答每一個疑問。</p>
<p>每一個人都得到解決而離去。</p>
<p>但江湖哲學家的心裏却永遠橫着一個問號。</p>
<p>賣唱女</p>
<p>有三弦伴着少女的歌聲，從牆的那邊飄送過來。　是夜深了，日間的炎熟，煩囂悄悄地躲了起來。這淫逸的，但也是悲凉的歌聲像是晚秋凄切的虫鳴，訴說着無數往昔的，哀怨的故事。我幻想着一個貧血的少女，乏力地張開蒼白的雙唇，强裝出尷尬的笑容；爲着換取一種低微的生活，出賣她的靈魂。</p>
<p>少女的歌喉是婉轉的，但，少女的靑春却是黯淡的。</p>
<p>歌聲停了，三弦孤獨地在我的窗前響過，有一陣輕輕的脚步聲，敲響着夜底寂寞。</p>
<p>三弦的聲音遠了。</p>
<p>我的遐想却被牽引得更遠了。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我聽了這種說明，腦中正在循環回憶的當口，忽見耀羣又把攔止的手式一揚，意思呌我注意。我一見這手式，趕緊側耳細聽，以爲又是嘯聲發動了，誰知聰來聽去，一絲什麼聲音，都未發覺。剛剛聽明了一點似乎枯葉落地的些微聲饗，只見屋子內光彩一閃，小老虎早已如飛一般，躍進門來：</p>
<p>「老伯，……紀姨，……」小老虎有些微微喘息。</p>
<p>「慢慢地說罷，孩子，」糧羣揮手，呌小老虎緩一口氣。</p>
<p>「申老叔把那位「雜拌兒」給擠作了，要她給調幾部車子，讓咱們大家走路，上大津，您知道……？」小老虎說到這裏，把一雙大圓眼睛，一連瞬了幾瞬，希望我們給他一個答覆。</p>
<p>「知道什麽，誰上天津？」耀羣問着小老虎，未竹等他答覆，却又側轉面來討我說：「您瞧，這孩子就這麽沒有層次，把話先從底裏說起，就像咱都是神仙，未卜先知……」耀羣說着，不禁自己也笑了起來。這是屋角草堆上的鼎元也醒了，正揉着眼睛。</p>
<p>「你從顯說罷，孩子。」我瞧着小老虎有些窘，儘瞬眼睛；怕他害臊，所以替他緩衝一下</p>
<p>原来大傻子剛才回到「大本營」去的當口，半路上碰見了我們那位火頭軍杜二和尙的太太「猛夜叉」劉氏。大傻子間她有什事？她說「他們都撩不開手，一個　站崗，一個要聽消息。」劉氏所謂「他們」，正是指的杜二和尙和她的內侄劉五。劉氏緊接吿訴大傻子，說劉五剛才收到北平緊急電訊，說鶴見已經到了關外，慢則一日夜，快則今天下午就可抵津，盼望我們這邊的人，都到天津會合，事情非常緊急重要。劉五收到這急電，慌了手脚，幸虧大傻子第一次回去取食品當口，無心說明了我們的所在，就在雙養橋底下山凹子裏。旣是杜二和劉五都走不開，所以劉氏才「摸索」了來。</p>
<p>大傻子因事情如此緊急，又怕劉氏的報吿有出入，因此把軍又開回「大本營」先看了電訊，又直接和北平通了話，一切弄明白了之後，又自作主張，跑到雙義橋耀羣的臨時辦公處，要求買沙夫調幾部汽車，作爲大家起身的準備。買沙夫沒有他理想的那般痛快，只盤間大傻子「要車作什麽曰？……上哪裏去？……」大傻子一急，就把手槍端了出來，逼住買沙夫打電話。</p>
<p>買沙夫當然不吃這一套，便施展手法，把大傻子的手槍奪了過去。幸虧旁邊還有咱們這邊的關外英雄老龍和武說，也在當塲，於是也亮了傢伙，這才把買沙夫給擠住了。但買沙夫口口聲聲要聽「隊長」（即耀羣）常面下令才肯服從。事情鬧到這一步，已成僵局，大傻子又不敢走開，這才用口嘯，隔地傳聲聲——因這買沙夫兇得很，害怕老龍武銳兩人制她不住，發生意外。小老虎口裏的「雜拌兒」，就是他給買沙夫定的綽號；因她有些不男不女的腔調。</p>

<h3>National Assembly Representatives Begin Electing Chairman; President and First Lady to Vote in Person; Legislative Yuan Candidate List to Be Announced Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Approximately 250 million voters in the Republic of China will, from the 21st to the 23rd, cast their ballots at polling stations in various electoral districts across the country, freely choosing representatives to the National Assembly. All 47 provinces and cities, as well as the 18 leagues and banners of Mongolia and the electoral districts of Tibet, along with various domestic professional organizations, will hold elections as scheduled. This marks the beginning of a truly universal suffrage in our country and the first time that voters nationwide will exercise their sacred right to vote, thereby laying the foundation for the nation's democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the preparatory work for the National Assembly, this reporter recently interviewed Interior Minister Zhang Lisheng, who stated that the establishment of the National Assembly Preparatory Office is still awaiting an official order from the National Government. As for the expenses for the preparatory work and the National Assembly period, the budget has not yet been approved. Zhang continued, saying that in the work he is overseeing, such as the renovation of the assembly hall under the Ministry of Interior and the public announcement of the list of candidates under the Election Headquarters, everything has been completed as scheduled, which is quite gratifying. This reporter then asked him to comment on the opening of the National Assembly election on the 21st, but Zhang only smiled and did not answer.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The voting for National Assembly representatives, which marks the beginning of democratic politics, will commence on the 21st. The election authorities in Nanjing are fully prepared. The 21st is designated for voting by women's organizations, with a total of 153,925 eligible women voters. The 22nd is for voting by professional organizations, with 78,274 eligible voters. The 23rd is for regional voting, with 589,467 eligible voters. In total, there are 821,666 eligible voters in Nanjing. There are 218 polling stations in Nanjing. On the morning of the 21st, Mayor Shen will inspect the various polling stations. It is also reported that Madame Chiang is scheduled to vote at the women's organization polling station at 11:00 AM on the 21st, while President Chiang is scheduled to vote at the regional polling station on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] After President Chiang announced his withdrawal as a candidate for National Assembly representative from Fenghua, the Central Government has reassigned Wang Zhengting and Xia Yuqun as the candidates for the county.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The list of Legislative Yuan candidates will be announced starting on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 20th from Shanghai, bringing with him the party's list of Legislative Yuan candidates. Although he had contact with Kuomintang figures during the day, no final decision was reached, so the list was not submitted as of the evening. Xu told reporters today that the list proposed by the party contains 100 names, which is the result of negotiations between Zhang Junmai and President Chiang. However, other members of the Democratic Socialist Party claim that they still insist on the same number of 120 as requested by the Youth Party, which was a promise made by the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Kuomintang's list of Legislative Yuan candidates has been largely reviewed and completed today. However, candidates from the Northeast and some pacification zones have not yet been submitted. It is understood that a certain number of slots have been reserved on the reviewed list of Legislative Yuan candidates to allow members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties to participate.</p>
<h3>Election Activities in Various Regions</h3>
<h3>Fuzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 20th] On the eve of the election, candidates in various parts of Fujian Province are vying for the last five minutes. There are over 220,000 voters in Fuzhou City, but with rice prices soaring to 720,000 and life being difficult, it is estimated that only 60% of voters will be able to participate in the voting. In the past six or seven days, restaurants and bathhouses have enjoyed a hundredfold increase in business, and the heads of bao and jia are overwhelmed. The propaganda texts of the candidates are scattered on the streets and in the newspapers. Jiang Xiuqing has the highest approval rating in the Fuzhou area. The Fuzhou City Journalists Association was the only one that did not send representatives to the election due to the delayed submission of the membership roster. In Linsen County, drums are beating loudly, and candidates are using them to call on voters, but satirical slogans have been discovered to attack each other. Cao Tingguang has a larger presence in the county, while Chen Changjie is unwilling to fall behind, competing in various villages and towns, making the situation more tense than in Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Hengyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hengyang, 20th] Amidst the election sound, Yang Kaijie and 24 other veterans from the Taoyuan United Headquarters Veterans Training Institute sent a telegram on the 18th calling for the allocation of National Assembly representative seats for veterans, saying in the telegram: "As long as there is still breath, the responsibility is not over."</p>
<h3>Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 20th] National Assembly representative election activities are becoming increasingly intense, with pleas of "Please cast your vote" found all over the city. Some newspapers have also published the candidates' political views as campaign material. There are over 500,000 registered voters in the city, and a total of 88 polling stations have been set up. Beiping City held a city councilor election on the 21st of last month, and citizens have already experienced a democratic process. Therefore, this National Assembly general election will surely be easy to handle and completed successfully.</p>
<h3>Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 20th] There are a total of 135 polling stations in Shenyang, and mobile ballot boxes have been set up on the railway to facilitate railway employees to vote. There are 560,000 voters in the city. Starting on the 21st, national flags will be hung throughout the city to celebrate this democratic event.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 20th] The general election is scheduled to begin on the 21st. Ninety-four polling stations have been set up in various urban areas, and administrators and supervisors have been assigned by the polling stations. Voting hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM for three days. In rural areas, gongs will be used to signal the start, while in urban areas, the signal from the power plant will be used. In recent days, election slogans and other promotional materials have been posted throughout the streets and alleys. However, the election methods used by all parties are considered enlightened, and there is not much feasting or entertaining.</p>
<h3>Nanchang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 20th] The first National Assembly general election will be held in various counties and cities in Jiangxi starting on the 21st. On the 20th, Nanchang City used a propaganda train to parade through the city, informing citizens to go to designated areas to vote on time on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Deferred Settlement Scheduled to Begin on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The deferred settlement of the Shanghai Stock Exchange is still being conducted on a trial basis. The financial authorities have now decided to officially implement it starting from New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Visits Foreign Minister Wang, Discusses Dalian Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Soviet Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Federin visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM on the 20th for talks. It is understood that they discussed the procedures for convening the initial meeting of the peace treaty with Japan and also touched on the Dalian issue. In the evening at 7:00 PM, Federin hosted a banquet for Director Zhang Zhizhong, who is about to return to Xinjiang, as well as Committee Member Bao Erhan, Northwest Administrative Secretary-General Liu Mengchun, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Xinjiang Liu Zerong, Director of the Asia-West Department Bu Daoming, and Qu Wu of the Xinjiang Provincial Committee, among others. The hosts and guests had a pleasant time.</p>
<h3>Dewey Issues Statement Advocating for Speedy Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 20th Broadcast: New York Governor Dewey issued a statement today at a press conference regarding President Truman's address to Congress. He expressed disappointment with the text, as it did not mention China or the situation in the Far East. He believes that while aid to Europe is important, the situation in China is even more urgent, and even a short delay of two months may be too late. The United States and the Chinese government fought side by side for five years and had promised to provide more assistance, but now our government seems to be allowing the Communists to conquer China, which is a great tragedy.</p>
<h3>Dutch Ambassador Returns to Post, Arrives in Nanjing from Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>

Dutch business groups that have built dams, harbors, and irrigation systems in China and operated light bulb factories are eager to have the opportunity to invest again in this "country that has always maintained friendly relations with the Netherlands." The Ambassador spoke of the current situation of the Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, saying: "Unfortunately, overseas Chinese are often the main target of attacks by Indonesian extremists, who rob overseas Chinese property, burn down overseas Chinese houses, and kill and kidnap overseas Chinese. Fortunately, many kidnapped overseas Chinese have been rescued by Dutch troops." Finally, the Ambassador said: "The regency of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands will end at the end of this month, and Queen Wilhelmina will resume her rule."</p>
<h3>China Urges US State Department to Study Note on Opening of Japanese Peace Conference; Britain Seeks Opinions of Various Dominions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] State Department Advisor Bohlen announced at a press conference today that the State Department has received a note from the Chinese government urging the Far Eastern Commission to convene an initial meeting as soon as possible to draft a peace treaty with Japan and is studying it. Bohlen went on to explain that there is nothing unusual in the Chinese note. It is merely reiterating the proposal made by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie in New York this fall and putting it on formal record. So far, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Japanese peace conference has not changed. The Soviet Union insists that it should be able to use its veto power at the conference. When asked by reporters whether the issue of the Japanese peace treaty would be raised at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in London, he replied that the issue was not on the agenda of the London Conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] A State Department official said that the issue of sending a Pakistani delegation to participate in the opening of the Japanese peace conference may be placed on the agenda first.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The Chinese government's note on the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty was delivered to London three days ago. Related parties predict that the British government will not reply immediately until it has sought the opinions of its dominion governments. However, it is understood that the British Dominion governments also agree in principle with the Chinese government's proposal to convene the eleven-nation preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Country Divided into Four Air Defense Zones; Communist Bandits in North China Have Secret Airfields</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The country's air defense situation is divided into four zones. The capital zone includes Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Henan, with Zhang Zhen as commander-in-chief and Chen Du as deputy. The Beiping zone includes Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Hebei, with Li Zongren as commander-in-chief and Hu Bohan as deputy. The Lanzhou zone includes Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, with Zhang Zhizhong as commander-in-chief and Gu Huixin as deputy. The Northeast zone includes the nine provinces of the Northeast, with Chen Cheng as commander-in-chief and He Kui as deputy. Also, the Ministry of National Defense's Air Defense School has decided to move from Guizhou to Huangsi on the outskirts of Beiping and is currently en route. Classes are expected to begin next spring.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Hu Bohan, former deputy commander of air defense in Chongqing, who was known for using red balls to assist in alarms during the Anti-Japanese War, is now the deputy commander of air defense in the Beiping zone, in charge of air defense in North China. On the eve of Air Defense Day, Hu told reporters that the Communist bandits in North China currently possess many secret airfields, but they are all used for the travel of important figures and for communication and liaison, and have not been used for combat. Although the air defense intelligence network in North China has not yet been widely established, it is barely sufficient. If radar is used in the future, this artificial intelligence network will become secondary. He warned that urban and industrial construction should take air defense into account, saying that a 4,000-pound bomb could turn the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant into ruins. Therefore, efforts should be made to disperse construction. He could not forget the air raid shelters in Chongqing, saying that they should be used to open small teahouses, which would be both a waste of talent and a benefit to the country.</p>
<h3>General Lucas Postpones Reception for Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Major Baalier of the US Military Advisory Group announced on the 20th that General Lucas's press conference originally scheduled for the 21st cannot be held on time due to unforeseen reasons and will have to be postponed for several days.

It is generally believed that the event that General Lucas originally intended to announce may be extremely important, or even related to the expansion of the group's business and organization, but after repeated delays, the final result is unknown.</p>

<h3>A Proposal Harmonizing U.S. and Soviet Views</h3>
<p>To break the deadlock between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, our government specifically sent notes to the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union on the 17th, proposing the following suggestions regarding the convening of a preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan: 1. A preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan should be composed of member states of the Far Eastern Commission. The date for the meeting should be agreed upon by China, Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union as soon as possible, in order to draft a peace treaty and discuss matters related to the convening of the final peace conference. 2. Voting at the meeting should be by a majority of all member states of the meeting. The previous requirement of a two-thirds majority will now be a simple majority, but this majority must include the affirmative votes of China, Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union. This proposal has been announced by the Information Office of the Executive Yuan, and the U.S. State Department is also studying it. It is clear that the proposal of our government is to reconcile the views of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the sense of respecting the views of the U.S. and the Soviet Union and respecting the status of the other eight countries, this proposal is a reasonable and constructive plan worthy of the attention of the Allied countries.</p>
<p>Concluding a peace treaty is a necessary step for belligerent countries to restore peaceful relations. Historically, every international war has been followed by the conclusion of a peace treaty, with very few exceptions. More than two years have passed since the end of World War II, but peace treaties with Germany and Japan have not yet been concluded. The victorious countries feel the urgent need for peace treaties, and the defeated countries feel even more fearful without them. Therefore, whether it is a peace treaty with Germany or a peace treaty with Japan, the victorious countries should negotiate as soon as possible. In principle, this must be done, and there should not be major problems. The only questions are how to conclude it, where to conclude it, and which countries should be the main participants. On these issues, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have divergent opinions, and even deviate from the decisions of the Potsdam Conference and the Moscow Conference, which shows that the minority does not respect the majority, and power politics does not respect public will. For the sake of obtaining the fruits of the war and for the sake of establishing world peace in the future, this is a great misfortune for the victorious countries.</p>
<p>Our country has always consistently hoped that negotiations for a peace treaty with Japan will begin as soon as possible and that it will be concluded as soon as possible. The peace treaty with Japan is the final chapter of our War of Resistance, and it has a great bearing on our country and the peace of the Far East. We should express any reasonable wishes. In August of this year, the United States proposed convening a preliminary peace conference, and our country responded with a welcoming attitude. However, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had disputes over procedural issues and veto power, which almost led to a deadlock. Our country took a detached stance and reconciled the views of both sides. Our country even issued a warning that it would not participate in a peace conference with Japan without the Soviet Union. Our country cherishes the achievements of the eleven Far Eastern countries in the war against Japan, and also places expectations on the Far Eastern Commission to complete its final mission. Based on this sentiment and the stance of respecting the public, our government put forward a new plan on the 17th of this month. Although the content of this plan is a compromise of the views of the U.S. and the Soviet Union and a reconciliation of the two major differences, its open and aboveboard attitude should be valued by the Allied countries. Our public opinion circles agree with this proposal and are willing to explain its significance as follows:</p>
<p>First, our country advocates that the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan should be composed of all member states of the Far Eastern Commission, which is close to the U.S. proposal to convene a preliminary peace conference of the eleven Far Eastern countries against Japan. According to the organization of the Far Eastern Commission, it is based on the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, "to fulfill the will of the Potsdam Declaration, implement the terms of surrender, and establish international security and stability." Any decision of the Far Eastern Commission must be agreed upon by all eleven countries. The peace treaty with Japan is the final chapter of the war against Japan and also the final chapter of the Far Eastern Commission. Therefore, it is beyond doubt that the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty should be composed of member states of the Far Eastern Commission and complete matters related to the formal peace conference. However, the date, location, and content of the peace conference will be decided by China, Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union. This is close to the Soviet Union's proposal that the peace treaty with Japan should be decided by the four powers.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the voting system of the peace conference, the United States focuses on striving for a "majority," while the Soviet Union focuses on maintaining its "veto power." The British Canberra Conference also expressed its support for the two-thirds voting system. Our country advocates that voting should be by a simple majority, but the majority must include the affirmative votes of China, Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union, which is tantamount to supporting the Soviet Union's proposal to maintain its veto power.</p>
<p>In short, the peace treaty with Japan should be completed as soon as possible, and the peace conference with Japan should not be delayed any longer. This time, the proposal of our government has, in principle, strived for diplomatic initiative. Now that the proposal has been put forward, we should seize the opportunity, work hard to implement it, and promote its realization. In terms of timing, this proposal is suitable to be put forward during the London Four Foreign Ministers Conference, which shows that although the procedural issue of the peace treaty with Japan has fallen into a deadlock, there is still a way to go. China's proposal is conciliatory and should be used as a diplomatic compromise plan between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. If the U.S. and the Soviet Union are willing to be tolerant and seek a compromise, then our country's proposal is undoubtedly a constructive plan. We hope that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will calmly consider this and take immediate action for the success of concluding a peace treaty with Japan!</p>

<h3>Key Points of Provisional Measures for Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper Nanjing 20th dispatch) The key points of the provisional measures for joint distribution of cotton yarn drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs are as follows: The distribution of cotton yarn produced by national and private yarn mills shall be handled temporarily in accordance with these measures under the guidance and supervision of the Textile Adjustment Committee. Except for the cotton yarn produced by the Shanghai area private yarn mills under the six-district association that is turned over to the government for contract spinning, supplied for export, and actually needed for self-weaving, all shall be handed over to the self-organized institutions of the six-district association for distribution. The cotton yarn produced by the state-owned yarn mills in the six districts shall be distributed by the China Textile Corporation. All cotton yarn produced by the government for contract spinning shall be distributed by the committee itself or entrusted to the China Textile Corporation for distribution. All factories and households in Shanghai and other ports engaged in the cotton yarn re-manufacturing industry shall register in accordance with regulations and shall be responsible for investigation and verification by the respective trade associations to ensure accuracy. The committee may also send personnel to conduct spot checks at any time. The respective trade associations of the cotton yarn re-manufacturing industry in Shanghai and other ports shall, according to the equipment and yarn demand of their member factories and households, negotiate and stipulate the minimum amount of cotton yarn to be allocated to each factory and household each month, prepare a list of yarn allocations, and submit it to the committee for distribution to the six-district association and the China Textile Corporation as the basis for distributing cotton yarn. The committee and the China Textile Corporation shall distribute cotton yarn only to qualified re-manufacturing entities or their member factories and households registered with the committee. Without the approval of the committee, cotton yarn shall not be distributed to yarn merchants engaged in transportation and sales to other ports. The cotton yarn jointly allocated to various manufacturing industries in each state shall be limited to being used as weaving raw materials only and shall not be resold for profit. All yarn distribution agencies shall sell yarn at the price set by the Textile Adjustment Committee.</p>
<h3>Measures for Improving Grain Storage, Transportation, Sales, and Distribution</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper Nanjing 20th dispatch) The measures for improving grain storage, transportation, sales, and distribution drafted by the Ministry of Food to enrich the grain supply in Shanghai have been approved by the Full Economic Committee on the 20th. These measures are based on the investigation report of Liu Zhendong, a member of the Full Economic Committee, after his visit to Shanghai. The key points are as follows: Regarding transportation, the Ministry of Communications shall issue an order to its subordinate water and land transportation agencies to give priority to the loading and transportation of rice and grain and reduce transportation costs. It is also proposed to request the National Government to issue an order to the provincial and municipal governments and local military and police units to provide practical assistance to the transportation and sales of grain that comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Food. Grain merchants purchasing and transporting civilian food can apply for remittance and deposit funds in accordance with the principles of grain deposit and remittance loans and the provisions of their implementation measures. The Shanghai Municipal Government should request Shanghai grain merchants to manage them in accordance with the regulations on grain merchant registration. As for brokers collecting commissions, they must also apply in accordance with regulations and report to the competent authorities for approval. If there are any cases of grain profiteering, they must be strictly investigated and dealt with. The allocation and sale of civilian food in Shanghai has established a Civilian Food Allocation Committee, which directly allocates and sells to users at fixed quantities and prices for certain targets, without selling grain numbers, and should continue to do so in the future. Grain merchants should join the local grain industry association. If the Shanghai Grain Industry Association is not yet sound, the Shanghai Municipal Government should earnestly supervise and inspect it to improve the organization, so as to assist in purchasing and transporting and prevent hoarding. In accordance with the economic reform plan, the Ministry of Food will list Shanghai as the first phase of Changpingcang construction areas and will handle it from the 37th year onwards. It will be prepared as soon as the Executive Yuan approves it.</p>

<h3>Chen Jianxin and Two Others Sentenced to Seven Years Imprisonment Each</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper Hangzhou 20th dispatch) Three Zhejiang University students and alumni who have attracted attention from all walks of life due to the Yu Zisan case were indicted by the High Procuratorate for the crime of internal rebellion. The High Court conducted a trial on the 17th and sentenced the defendants Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Yu Bomo at 9:30 this morning by the original trial judges Zhang Qi, Li Fen, and Han Zuoti. They were found guilty of intending to destroy the group by violence, seizing national territory, and changing the country and overthrowing the government by illegal means. They were each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for seven years, and the anti-government pictorials and letters seized were confiscated. According to Director Zhang, Yu Zisan's confession transcript in the Zhejiang Security Command is sufficient to be adopted. However, considering that the defendants are young and promising, they were given a lenient sentence of seven years of imprisonment. It is hoped that they will continue to serve the society well after their release. However, the defendants remained silent at the time. It is reported that Zhejiang University students are discussing the issue of appeal.</p>
<h3>Longhai Railway Intermittent, Highway Line Planned for Remedy, Trial Car Starts from Ningxia to Han</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 20th] The Longhai Railway is intermittently cut off, which greatly affects transportation between the Northwest and Southeast. This problem is currently being addressed by the responsible authorities. According to Shen Qi, the director of the Seventh District Highway Transportation Office who is currently in Nanjing, the interruption of the Longhai Railway has had a significant impact on the region's external transportation, and the transportation of various equipment to be used is inconvenient. After continuous negotiations with relevant parties in Beijing, it is believed that there are three routes that can be used: From Chongqing via Guangyuan, and then to the Northwest provinces. From Hankou via Laohekou, Ankang, and then to the Northwest provinces. From Baotou via Ningxia and then to the Northwest provinces. Among them, the second route is the most convenient. The Seventh District Bureau already has a trial car carrying more than ten passengers from Ningxia to Hankou. If the trial car is successful, there will be further development in transportation between the Southeast and Northwest provinces in the future.</p>

If only sulfonamide drugs are used, the mortality rate is 70%. The new method is very simple, just use the commonly used dose to take sulfonamide orally and intravenously inject immune serum.</p>
<h3>Four Joint Loan Interest Rate Policy Remains Unchanged Xu Baiyuan's Speech Reveals Defects in Low-Interest Rate Policy Decided to Remedy</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper Nanjing 20th dispatch) Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Four Joint Offices, received reporters in the afternoon of the 20th and expressed his views on the adjustment of interest rates, and announced that the Four Joint Offices would temporarily not change the current loan interest rate policy. The full text of the speech is as follows: Since the reorganization of the Four Joint Offices in the 28th year, the reasons for the low-interest rate policy adopted for loans to national bureaus and offices have been very clear. First, during the War of Resistance, the rear area needed to be self-sufficient, and prices needed to be stable. National bureaus and offices should provide capital assistance to the necessary production undertakings for the national economy and people's livelihood at low interest rates to reduce the burden and encourage increased production. Although the national bureaus and offices have low interest rates, they are of great benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood, as can be proven by past various industrial and mining loans, agricultural loans, grain loans, etc. Second, most of the loans from national bureaus and offices are directly related to the government's financial burden and economic policies. For example, increasing loan interest rates will directly increase government expenditures or directly contradict the price stabilization policy. For example, for loans from government agencies secured by budgets, increasing the interest rate will inevitably increase their burden. Also, for loans to assist in the production and sales of price-stabilized goods, the higher the interest rate, the higher the pricing will be. If high interest rates are adopted, they will contradict the original policy. For example, for certain public utilities, their pricing and debt financing are limited. The low-interest rate policy is precisely to reduce the burden on the undertaking and maintain its price limit, and its benefits are enjoyed by the local citizens. Also, for loans to assist in the production and sales of export goods, the purpose is to earn foreign exchange to replenish the fund. Sometimes the government would rather subsidize it or bear the exchange losses. If the loan also adopts high interest rates, it would be self-contradictory. Other loans such as agricultural improvement and increased production loans, water conservancy loans, cooperative production loans, and loans related to cultural education - such as the loan for printing primary and secondary school textbooks in previous years - are all concrete manifestations of the national bureaus and offices serving the country and society loyally by implementing a low-interest rate policy in the past.</p>
<p>In principle, national bureaus and offices maintain a low-interest rate policy for loans, but the interest rate has gradually increased. Before the 29th year, the average interest rate for various loans was less than 1% per month. Before the 31st year of the Republic of China, it rarely exceeded 2% per month. Afterwards, it gradually increased, but before victory, it rarely exceeded 3.6% per month. Since the restoration, the financial market has changed frequently, the money supply has been tight and loose from time to time, and the magnitude of price increases and decreases has increased significantly. Interest rates have generally trended upward. The average loan interest rate of national bureaus and offices a month ago was about 5% per month.</p>
<p>The loan interest rate of national bureaus and offices is much lower than the market interest rate. Before victory, the market interest rate in the rear area was about 1% per month. Since the restoration, it has risen steadily. Recently, the interest rate in Shanghai is often above 2% per month. Other important cities are roughly the same. Commercial banks absorb deposits at high interest rates and then make short-term loans at even higher interest rates. The higher the interest rate, the greater the profits of the bank. However, this high-interest rate environment will inevitably hinder the development of legitimate production undertakings and inevitably force prices to jump up. For example, calculated at 2% per month with monthly compound interest, the interest cost in one year is more than eight times the principal.</p>
<p>Today, the loan interest rate of national bureaus and offices differs too much from the general market interest rate, which can easily lead to various malpractices. For example: 1. For production undertakings that meet the loan principles but whose products are not subject to price controls, if they can obtain loans or loans are particularly large, they are in a better position than other manufacturers, and the price of their products is still calculated based on the general high-interest rate cost, so the low-interest rate is not an extra subsidy. 2. Therefore, it is easy to delay loan repayments, or those who have sufficient funds themselves or whose production does not meet the golden rules and is below the margin will inevitably try to obtain loans in various ways. Therefore, reviewing loan applications and assessing loan uses has become an extremely complex and difficult task, and each bureau's handling of loans is also troublesome and difficult. The above points are the defects that are most likely to occur under a low-interest rate policy. After repeated discussions, it is generally believed that the way forward is to choose one of the following two methods: 1. Loans from national bureaus and offices should be limited to those that strictly match national policy. For production undertakings that are not subject to price controls and are responsible for their own profits and losses, even if they meet the original loan principles, they will not be granted loans. The Ministry of Finance will order commercial banks to provide them with financial accommodation as soon as possible. 2. National bureaus and offices should implement differentiated interest rates for loans. Low-interest rate policies will still be adopted for loans that fully comply with national policies. For the aforementioned production undertakings that are responsible for their own profits and losses, interest will be calculated with reference to market interest rates. The use and effectiveness of the loan should still be strictly assessed, and the organization and implementation of the audit and inspection agency should be strengthened. (The Four Joint Offices decided not to change the four principles of the loan interest rate, published on the seventh page)</p>
<h3>Severe Cold in Changchun, Coal Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>[Central Press Correspondent, Changchun, 20th] After two snowfalls here, the weather is bitterly cold. The 600,000 citizens are living in shivering conditions due to the exorbitant price of coal. Although the relevant authorities have investigated and stated that the city's coal reserves have doubled or increased by about 60,000 tons, the market price continues to rise every day. Currently, each ton has reached 280,000 yuan in circulation. Except for a few wealthy families who can still afford to buy coal for heating, general civil servants and citizens are using coal residue for heating. All agencies and organizations have now suspended heating to save coal.</p>

<h3>French President Accepts Ramadier's Resignation, Blum Appointed to Form Cabinet, Government Calls in Troops to Suppress Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>(United Press, Paris, 19th) Premier Ramadier, unable to cope with the national labor unrest, resigned to President Auriol tonight. After granting permission, the President expressed his gratitude for Ramadier's courage and self-sacrifice and formally appointed Blum (see picture) to form a new cabinet. Blum then held a meeting with Ramadier, Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet, Labor Minister Mayoux, and other party leaders at the Ministry of Labor to discuss national affairs.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 20th) France, where 600,000 major industrial workers have downed tools, has not yet formed a new government since the resignation of the Ramadier government. However, negotiations to form a middle-of-the-road government are actively underway. It is rumored that Blum has reached an agreement with middle-party leaders, including People's Republican Party leader Bidault, to establish a joint plan to resolve France's turbulent situation and economic problems. Sources predict that if Blum succeeds in forming a cabinet, he will also serve as Foreign Minister, in which case the French representative to the London Foreign Ministers' Conference will definitely be replaced. President Auriol received People's Republican Party leaders and National Assembly Speaker Herriot yesterday, and this morning summoned Socialist Party and other parliamentary leaders.</p>
<p>The situation in the Marseille labor unrest has not improved, with more than 100,000 dockworkers and other workers still on strike. The navy destroyers "Loire" and "Bambara" are docked in the port, ready to reinforce the on-shore security forces when necessary. Three naval barges also arrived in Marseille with the destroyers to perform towing tasks. 350,000 metalworkers in Paris are on strike, demanding a 25% wage increase, and the situation remains deadlocked. There are no signs of resumption of work by 150,000 miners in the northern French coalfields and 15,000 flour mill workers in Paris. Newspapers in Paris are concerned and even doubtful about whether any new government can handle the situation facing the country. The right-wing "L'Aurore" newspaper straightforwardly advocates holding general elections, believing that the current situation cannot be resolved by personnel changes.</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Emergency Aid to Europe Bill, But Does Not Guarantee Availability of Supplies</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 19th) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed a bill to provide emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria by a vote of 13 to 0. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said: The Foreign Relations Committee has passed some amendments to the State Department's original emergency foreign aid plan. One of these is that "the Emergency Aid Act shall not contain any obligation to provide aid to any of the countries listed in this bill, nor shall it guarantee the availability of any specific goods." The purpose of this amendment is to address criticisms that the US economy lacks many of the items listed in the bill. Vandenberg also expressed hope that the bill would be passed by the full Senate on November 27. The original request for the bill was to allocate $597 million to supply food and other materials to France, Italy, and Austria. The bill passed by the Foreign Relations Committee stipulates that the US loans obtained by France, Italy, and Austria can only be used to purchase goods in the United States up to 75%, allowing the three countries to purchase goods from other countries with more US dollars. Vandenberg also specifically pointed out a crucial amendment: the quantities of various materials listed in the bill are expected targets, not obligations or contracts that the United States must fulfill. The Foreign Relations Committee did not change the total amount of aid, which is $598 million. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to complete a draft of the Emergency Aid to France, Italy, and Austria bill early next week, and the content is not expected to differ significantly from that passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<h3>President Requests Special Powers, Congress to Temporarily Shelve</h3>

<h3>Britain and the United States Notify the United Nations that a Military Government Has Been Established in Trieste</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Lake Success, 19th) Britain and the United States notified United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie today that they have established a military government in the former British-American occupied zone of the Trieste Free Territory pending the appointment of a governor by the Security Council, and declared that they have ordered the local military commander not to hinder the local government and residents from implementing the provisions of the peace treaty in a free and democratic manner.</p>
<h3>Italy Requests Trusteeship of Former Colonies</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 19th) Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Count Sforza, presented the Italian government's views on Italy's former colonies to the representatives of the four foreign ministers, requesting that Italy be granted trusteeship over Libya, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland. Count Sforza also stated that Italy's request for trusteeship over these three territories is based on a generous spirit of freedom, and the Italian government is deeply aware that this spirit of freedom is the new guiding principle of world international relations. Italy's acquisition of these lands was also based on legitimate possession, and the Italian people deeply hope that their mission in Africa can be resumed under a different spirit and new legal and political system.</p>
<h3>Marshall Flies to London to Attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, US-Soviet Diplomacy Will Be Given Serious Consideration</h3>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 20th) Secretary of State Marshall flew to London this afternoon aboard the presidential aircraft "Sacred Cow" to attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. State Department Counselor and Soviet Affairs Advisor Bohlen accompanied him. US relations with the Soviet government are expected to face a new and more serious test as a result.</p>
<p>Marshall's mission is the same as the goal of the previous four conferences, which is to seek an agreement with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the Austrian peace treaty and at least determine the outline of the German peace treaty, but the fundamental problem lies in the increasingly tense relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries. If the Soviet Union obstructs again, France may join Britain and the United States in establishing a joint three-nation occupation zone in Germany.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 19th) "The Daily Sketch" reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will arrive in London soon. The newspaper said that a British airport received a telegram from Moscow last night stating that two aircraft had taken off from Moscow and requested that the airport be prepared.</p>
<h3>Austin Discusses US-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>(US Information Service, Lake Success, 19th) US Representative to the United Nations Austin declared today that "this session of the General Assembly has proven to be the most outstanding conference since the establishment of the United Nations organization." In response to several questions raised by reporters, Austin reiterated his belief that US-Soviet relations can be improved by "deepening our understanding of each other." He said that negotiations with Soviet officials have been difficult and almost permanently fruitless. A frank exchange of views is rarely possible, and this is something that can often help resolve disputes with other countries. Austin emphasized the achievements of this session of the General Assembly, including the establishment of the Small Assembly, the Balkan Committee, and the Committee for the Promotion of Korean Independence.</p>
<h3>The Five-Power Veto Issue Submitted to the Small Assembly for Discussion</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Lake Success, 19th) The General Assembly's Political Committee recently decided by a vote of 30 to 7, with 11 abstentions, to submit the veto issue to the newly established "Small Assembly" for study. In addition, it passed by a vote of 43 to 1, with 8 abstentions, a resolution that the permanent members of the committee should consult on the veto power in order to agree on measures to enable the Security Council to exercise its functions quickly and effectively. Soviet representative Gromyko pointed out that the US request for the Small Assembly to discuss the veto power is an attempt to revise the provisions of the Charter regarding the veto power of the great powers, and he absolutely opposes this move, as the Charter clearly stipulates that the veto power cannot be changed.</p>
<h3>Firmly Opposed to the Partition of the Holy Land, the Arab Group Proposes a Recommendation Requiring the Establishment of a Unified and Independent State Ruled by Arabs</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Lake Success, 19th) Six Arab countries, as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan, today submitted a lengthy ten-point report to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, requesting the establishment of a unified and independent state controlled by Arabs, the termination of the British Mandate, the withdrawal of British troops within one year, and warned that any attempt at partition would lead to a prolonged war. The Nine-Nation Subcommittee has finally approved the partition plan proposed by the United States and the Soviet Union, which will be discussed tonight by the 57-nation Palestine Special Committee.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Lake Success, 19th) The General Assembly's Palestine Committee's partition subcommittee agreed today to place the city of Jerusalem under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, and Jerusalem and the surrounding area will become an international zone. The Soviet representative, who had previously opposed trusteeship, surprisingly expressed support, allowing the entire subcommittee to reach a unanimous agreement.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Lake Success, 19th) The main points of the report of the representatives of the Arab countries are as follows: 1. The partition proposal violates the principles of the Mandate and directly violates the principles of the League of Nations and the United Nations Charter. 2. The Arab people have been the occupants of Palestine for centuries and have the right to establish a state and self-determination in that land. 3. The doubts about the letters exchanged between McMahon and Hussein should be resolved by the International Court of Justice (the letters mainly stated that Britain's promises to the Arab people could not coexist with its promises to the Jewish people). 4. The legality and interpretation of the Balfour Declaration should be referred to the International Court of Justice for a ruling. 5. The League of Nations has already temporarily recognized the independence of Palestine. 6. After the dissolution of the League of Nations, the Mandate lost its legal basis, and Britain has also announced its intention to abandon the Mandate, so there is no obstacle to Palestine becoming an independent country. 7. The United Nations organization does not inherit the powers of the League of Nations and therefore cannot succeed the League of Nations as the supervisor of the Mandate system. The report also argued that unless a trusteeship agreement is negotiated by the Mandatory Power, the General Assembly or other United Nations bodies have no right to implement resolutions on Mandated Territories. The report further suggested that the Palestine issue be removed from the General Assembly's agenda and that, in any case, the opinion of the International Court of Justice should be obtained first. The report further emphasized that neither the whole nor part of Palestine can be placed under the control of any foreign government, and the United Nations organization must respect the principle of national self-determination.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Refuses to Attend</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York Radio 20th: Lake Success, the United Nations Trusteeship Council convened today, with US Representative Sayre serving as chairman, and the chairman announced the meeting's opening.

In his speech, Sayre emphasized the importance of the Council's mission.</p>
<h3>US State Department Announces That Each Person Can Remit $1,000</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 19th) The US State Department announced that the regulations governing the US military government in Japan have been relaxed, allowing the Chase Bank to remit funds to any private individual in Japan. The State Department said that the purpose of this action is to make it easier for foreign individuals and organizations to remit funds to the Japanese people for relief and similar purposes, and to enable foreign businessmen going to Japan to have funds for their daily expenses. Under the revised regulations, any private individual in Japan can remit up to $1,000 per month from a bank authorized to establish a branch in Japan by the United States.</p>
<h3>US Tariff Reduction, Congressmen Express Opposition</h3>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 20th) The chairman of the US House Budget Committee, Republican Congressman Knutson, attacked the Geneva Tariff Agreement on the 20th, saying that it would threaten the American standard of living. Republican Congressman Simpson said that this 23-nation trade agreement, which will take effect on January 1 next year, is a disaster, and that if a large number of foreign imports flood the domestic market, it will put American industry in dire straits.</p>

<h3>Crowds Gather at Westminster Abbey, Tens of Thousands Cheer on Both Sides of the Road as the British Heir to the Throne Marries, Mountbatten Promoted to Duke</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Westminster, 20th) Today is the auspicious day for the Princess Elizabeth's wedding. The morning mist was hazy, and the weather was mild. When the wedding ceremony was held, the morning sun began to drive away the clouds. Shortly after 7:00 AM, the Princess had already risen and applied makeup in front of the mirror. She only called for her maid to help when she put on her wedding dress. Before dawn, 40,000 people had gathered in Parliament Square, mostly women. The Duke of Edinburgh, the newly ennobled groom Philip Mountbatten, also washed at Kensington Palace around 7:00 AM, with his hangover from last night still lingering.</p>
<p>Before 9:00 AM, 250,000 people had filled the streets, some carrying footstools, others climbing trees for a high vantage point. Thousands of policemen lined the route the royal carriage would take, preventing this behavior. At 9:30 AM, soldiers came out to block the lines. The soldiers wore military uniforms instead of formal attire. Shortly after 9:00 AM, the guests began to arrive at Westminster Abbey in an endless stream. Four Englishmen had been standing outside the abbey all night. At that moment, they collapsed and were sent to the first aid station for treatment. There were 30 first aid stations and thousands of personnel along both sides of the route.</p>
<p>Before 9:00 AM, the fog cleared slightly, but the sky was still not clear.</p>
<p>Police estimated that the crowds watching the ceremony were as large as those at the coronation of George VI. The guests were either in uniform or wearing morning dress, and some Scots wore kilts. Many of the female guests wore fur coats. Four Royal Air Force guards fainted in front of the White House War Memorial and received immediate first aid. Within ten minutes, eight women also fainted around the memorial.</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, the sunlight broke through the clouds and shone everywhere, but soon receded. The first aid stations were doing brisk business. By 10:00 AM, 200 people had sought treatment, and six had been sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>At 11:03 AM, the Queen, accompanied by Princess Margaret and members of the royal families of various countries, left Buckingham Palace, and thousands of people outside the palace shouted to welcome them. At the same time, Queen Mary left Marlborough House and arrived at Westminster Abbey at 11:10 AM. The band played "God Save the King," and the tens of thousands of people outside the abbey cheered in unison. The cavalry escorting the Queen's carriage wore new and fashionable uniforms, and the horses were tall and beautiful, looking around with extraordinary demeanour.</p>
<p>At 11:16 AM, Princess Elizabeth, accompanied by George VI, left Buckingham Palace and boarded the Irish State Coach. The crowds along the road cheered thunderously. At 11:15 AM, the Duke of Edinburgh arrived at the Poets' Corner entrance of Westminster Abbey. King George and his daughter arrived at Westminster Abbey at 11:28 AM. As the carriage approached, the huge crowd suddenly fell silent, and then suddenly erupted in cheers like a landslide, lasting for a long time. King George helped his daughter out of the carriage. Elizabeth straightened her clothes slightly and then walked into the abbey.</p>
<p>Among the guests, Churchill was cheered repeatedly. As Churchill stepped out of the car, he took off his cigar and nodded to the crowd.</p>
<p>To the sound of bugles, Elizabeth and her father slowly walked 300 feet forward on the red carpet, walking slightly to one side, lest they accidentally step on the tomb of the Unknown Warrior.</p>
<p>At 11:35 AM, the Bishop of Westminster began to lead the wedding service, reciting the famous words of the Church of England: "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony."</p>
<p>The Bishop then asked Philip whether he would take Elizabeth to be his wife. Philip answered in a calm and low voice: "I will." Elizabeth's voice trembled slightly as she uttered the words "I will." Philip's answer was calm and steady, while the Princess's was enthusiastic and eager. At 11:45 AM, the Church of England wedding ceremony was completed, and the choir sang Hymn 67. The Archbishop of York then delivered a brief homily, saying: "Life should not be selfish, and a happy married life is unselfish." He urged the couple to make their home "an oasis of peace and tranquility" and blessed them with "joy, peace, and happiness."</p>
<p>The newlyweds then walked to Edward the Confessor's Chapel to sign the register with the gold pen that the Princess's parents had used before. At this time, the Princess's dress was accidentally blocked by a candlestick, and the attendants untangled it. The two signed their names four times to comply with the domestic law. Then they returned to the hall to meet the crowd. When they went out, Philip repeatedly looked back at the train of his wife's wedding dress.

<h3>Zhao's Lechery Leads to Murder: Young Woman Dies Tragically Under Butcher's Knife; Case Solved in Just 24 Hours</h3>
<p>The Murderer Liu Xigen was Arrested in Changzhou and Escorted to Shanghai for Trial and Punishment. The Following is a Record of the Beginning and End of the Incident.</p>
<p>The deceased, Lu Jinfeng, 27 years old, was from Ningbo and was quite beautiful. In her early years, she was betrothed to Li Ronggen (a copper craftsman) as his wife, but she could not support herself. Lu Jinfeng was accustomed to vanity. At the end of the 31st year, she met Wu Jinhai, a fellow villager, and eloped with him. She returned to her hometown in Changzhou and lived with him for eight months. Later, Wu died of illness, and Jinfeng also unfortunately fell ill and could not afford medical treatment. Through an introduction, she met the murderer Liu Xigen (29 years old, from Changzhou), who helped her seek medical treatment. After recovering from her illness, she held a banquet with three tables of wine, but she did not hold a ceremony and lived together hastily.</p>
<p>The incident started when Liu, in addition to farming in the countryside at the time, saw the end of the business. Soon after, he came to Shanghai with her. Liu joined the Jiali Box Factory on Huai'an Road, but soon became unemployed. Due to economic difficulties, Jinfeng worked as a female worker in the Jiuzhang Cloth Factory, where the remuneration was very high, but she still had a passion for dressing up and had illicit relationships with men outside. As a result, the feelings between the two gradually deteriorated. Recently, Liu went to Jinfeng's factory to ask for money but was rejected, which made him even more resentful, so he plotted to kill her.</p>
<p>At 8:00 p.m. on the 15th, Liu went to Feng's factory again, but his request for a loan was not granted and he was scolded. That night, Liu returned home, tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. On the morning of the 16th, he found a butcher knife in Huangzhong and hid it on his body. He went straight to the Jiuzhang Cloth Factory, but because he saw many people in the factory, it was not easy to attack, so he wandered around in front of the factory.</p>
<p>The murder occurred at 2:30 p.m. Feng's mother, Chen, happened to be going out of the factory and met him. She told him that Feng had gone with her sister A to the Nanyang Tobacco Company on Jiaozhou Road to find her brother-in-law Cao Junsheng. When Liu heard this, he hurriedly chased after them. He saw the two sisters sitting idly in the company's gatehouse. He invited them to go to Cao Junsheng's house for dinner. At about 8:00 p.m., he accompanied Feng in hiring a pedicab to go to the Jiuzhang Cloth Factory. Along the way, Feng was unhappy. After the pedicab reached its destination, Feng quickly walked into the alley, and Liu followed in. When he reached the corner, he looked around and saw no one, and it was extremely dark, so he took out the butcher knife, used his left hand to hold Feng's neck, and stabbed her left cheek with the knife. Feng screamed in pain, blood gushing out like a spring, and staggered to the ground.</p>
<p>Fled at Night</p>
<p>At this point, the murderer abandoned the knife and fled wildly. He went to the North Railway Station, but because he had no money, he sold a white cloth shirt for 28,000 yuan. At 4:00 a.m. the next morning, he took a bus back to Changzhou. After the Jiangning Police Bureau in charge of the area was informed, Wang, the branch director, ordered Lin Deming, the section chief, to lead the police to investigate and obtained the name and identity of the murderer from the deceased before her death. The handling police immediately tracked down the murderer's mother-in-law Lu Chen, brother-in-law Cao Junsheng, his brother Liu Genrong, uncle Liu Chaotian, and the factory where the murderer worked. Finally, they determined that the murderer must have fled to his hometown in the countryside.</p>
<p>Arrested</p>
<p>Later, it was learned from Cao Junsheng that Liu often went to Longhutang Houhuzhuang outside Changzhou Gate. Dai, a section member, led police Zhao Bingliang and Cao to Changzhou on the morning after the incident. They went to the above-mentioned location and found the murderer sleeping in a straw shed, surrendering without resistance. He was escorted back to Shanghai immediately. After interrogation, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. This case, from the time it occurred to the time it was solved, took only 24 hours.</p>
<h3>The District Prosecutor's Office Summoned Leng Shan to Confront Zhang Chunfan</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) In the case of Zhang Chunfan accusing Leng Shan of abducting women and obstructing freedom, prosecutor Lu Zhennan summoned Leng Shan for questioning at 2:00 p.m. yesterday and brought the detained Zhang Chunfan for confrontation. At 3:15 p.m., the interrogation seemed to be over. Leng Shan was released on bail, and Zhang was still detained.</p>
<p>It is reported that Leng first expressed doubts about whether Zhang had the qualifications to sue, because the household registration records showed that they were uncle and niece. The court questioned Zhang on this basis, and he replied that he and Xiao Shi were living together. As for the information recorded in the household registration, it was because they needed to act, so they filled in the information as uncle. The court turned to question Leng Shan, asking if there were more than 70 hugs when performing the play "Qinhuai Moon"? Since the correspondence was for studying art, why did he borrow Liu Qiong's mailbox? Leng replied: When "Qinhuai Moon" was performed, he himself was in Suzhou. Zhang's claim that he was the screenwriter and director of the play was also incorrect. The director of the play was Ying Jian, and the screenwriter was Liu Tao. He also submitted explanations to the court as evidence. As for borrowing Liu Qiong's mailbox, it was also at Xiao's request, because in the past, Yue Opera fans wrote letters to Xiao, and the wording was slightly inappropriate, so Zhang ordered people to go and beat them, so he did it according to Xiao's instructions.</p>

<h3>The Yu Shengxiao Murder Case Ends; Que Li is Sentenced to Long-Term Imprisonment; The British Consulate Believes it is Fair</h3>

British national Que Li was also sentenced to life imprisonment by our local court.</p>
<p>At 3:00 p.m., Que Li A Que was escorted to court by 30 bailiffs. Que wore a white mesh shirt with a large lapel, a coffee-colored plaid Harris jacket, gray legal-grade velvet trousers, and yellow leather shoes. He was calm and composed, but his face was pale. At 3:02 p.m., Presiding Judge Zhu Yuhuang, Prosecutor Ding Tongjun, and Clerk Zhuang Zhide took their seats and ordered Que Li to stand in the defendant's column, with six bailiffs and five court attendants guarding him on the side. After questioning his name and age, Judge Zhu stood up and read the main text: "Que Li A Que is sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life for jointly robbing and intentionally killing people." When Que Li heard the verdict, he initially forced himself to remain calm and his face did not change, but as the presiding judge read the main points of the reasoning, his emotions gradually became tense and he showed obvious signs of anger. After reading, Judge Zhu declared that the case must be automatically submitted to the Supreme Court for review according to law. If the defendant does not agree, he can submit concrete reasons within ten days after receiving the judgment. Que's defense lawyer, Tang Huaiqun, immediately stood up and requested that the judgment be sent to the defense lawyer to translate it into English and hand it over to the defendant for detailed reading. Judge Zhu approved it. At 3:25 p.m., the court adjourned and Que Li was returned to custody.

<h3>How the Initial Passage Through the Three Gorges' Kongling Shoal Came to Be Known as "Gates of Hell"</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Yichang by our newspaper, dated the 12th) The beautiful scenery and perilous terrain of the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River have long been renowned throughout history and across the world. A mere pen cannot even begin to capture its essence. Taking a downstream boat from Chongqing, one would only enter the first gorge, Qutang Gorge, around 5 PM on the second day. This gorge is also known as Guangxi Gorge, stretching from Baidi City in the west to Wushan County in the east. At the narrowest point of the gorge entrance, the river surface is extremely constricted, with towering cliffs rising vertically from both banks, soaring into the clouds. The tranquil river flow is suddenly constrained, stirring up countless waves. The river surface is filled with rapidly swirling eddies. All along the way, there are precipitous cliffs, and without the sun directly overhead, it is difficult to see the sun and moon.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived at Wushan County, it was already dark, so appreciating the scenery of the Wushan Gorge had to wait until early the next morning. This section, from Wushan County to Gongbokou, is famous for the Twelve Peaks of Wushan, standing majestically in between. They are situated half on the north bank and half on the south bank of the river. The sailors on the boat pointed out the names of the twelve peaks as if reciting a family treasure. There were names like Wangxia, Cuiping, Chaoyun, Songluan, Jixian, Juhe, Jingtan, Shangsheng, Qiyun, Feifeng, Denglong, and Shengquan. Whenever a high peak was spotted, its name was immediately called out. However, to unfamiliar travelers, these peaks seemed more like identical twins, and it was impossible to remember them all. One only felt that the peaks were staggered and closely packed, with overlapping cliffs and rocks, blocking the sun and obscuring its rays, making the Yangtze River twist and turn beyond recognition.</p>
<p>When the boat reached Badong, we were told that we had entered the Xiling Gorge. This section, extending all the way to Yichang, is the longest of the Three Gorges, with even more shoals and gorges. The names are novel and the terrain extremely perilous. A few of the most famous ones include Niukou Shoal, Kongling Shoal, Xietan Shoal, Binghuabinjian Gorge, Niuganmafei Gorge, and Dengying Gorge. Among them, the Kongling Shoal is the place where boats on the Sichuan River are most likely to have accidents. Sailors navigating the Sichuan River often say: "Xietan Shoal is not a shoal, but Kongling is truly the Gates of Hell."</p>
<p>Navigating the Sichuan River (referring to the stretch of the Yangtze River between Chongqing and Yichang) is not like sailing on the ocean. Everywhere there are hidden reefs and numerous shoals, and the water level varies greatly between the high-water and low-water seasons each year. It is essential to have an experienced pilot when navigating. These pilots must remember the height and size of every shoal and every hidden reef on the Sichuan River, and, on the treacherous Sichuan River filled with traps, they must feel their way forward as if walking on thin ice to find a safe passage. Almost all of the current Sichuan River pilots are former captains of wooden boats that navigated the Sichuan River in the early years. With decades of experience navigating the Sichuan River, they serve as the eyes for the safety of every shipping vessel.</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Guangxu reign (1900), the German ship "Ruishui" attempted to navigate the Sichuan River. When the ship reached Kongling Shoal, the Chinese helmsman on board steered directly towards a large rock called "Come at Me" standing on the shoal, as if determined to crash into the reef. The German captain, unable to bear it any longer, grabbed the helm and immediately turned the ship. But as soon as he turned the helm, the ship struck a hidden reef on the riverbed and immediately broke apart and sank. At this point, the German captain finally understood that the helmsman steering directly towards the "Come at Me" rock had a purpose. Ashamed and furious, he pulled out a gun and took his own life. It turned out that when a ship reached Kongling Shoal, because of the complex arrangement of nearby hidden reefs, it had to steer directly towards the "Come at Me" rock, and only when it was about to hit the rock could the helm be turned, so that the ship could enter the only narrow, safe escape route. Turning the helm too soon, before the right moment, would cause the ship to hit the reef. That is why Kongling Shoal earned the honored name "Gates of Hell." Countless ships have met tragic ends here. Sichuan River pilots still "pale at the mention of the tiger" when they tell this anecdote.</p>
<p>Passing through the Three Gorges, one is reminded of how, in prehistoric times, the Yangtze River engaged in a thrilling and fierce struggle with the Kunlun Mountains and its branches. In the end, the thousands of cliffs and peaks of Kunlun could not stop the raging waves of the Yangtze River. After conquering over 5,500 kilometers and flowing through nine provinces, it flows eastward into the sea. The unyielding perseverance and spirit of the Yangtze River should serve as a warning sign for the Chinese people. Let us learn from the Yangtze River! (Special correspondent Hu Longchang)</p>
<h3>The Central Government Allocates 300 Million to Relief Disaster Victims in Yancheng and Suining</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Zhenjiang by our newspaper, dated the 19th] Yancheng in northern Jiangsu province was once captured by bandits at the beginning of last month. Suining city was besieged by more than 10,000 communist bandits. The people in both places suffered huge losses, and the disaster situation is particularly severe. The provincial government has previously requested emergency relief from the central government. The Executive Yuan has now telegraphed that 100 million will be allocated to Yancheng for emergency relief, and 200 million to Suining. The funds will be transferred to the provincial treasury by the Ministry of Finance and then remitted and distributed separately for investigation. Also: The Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly believes that the counties in northern Jiangsu are suffering from floods and bandit disasters, and that there will be more refugees during this winter. It has specifically sent a letter to the Provincial Department of Land and Food and the Department of Social Affairs to transfer grain from the bountiful counties where the land tax has already been collected to provide relief to disaster victims in northern Jiangsu. The departments have forwarded the request to the provincial government for approval. Another report: The Provincial Capital Security Conference was convened yesterday and resolved three items: 1. The curfew hours will be changed to 11 PM to 5 AM, effective immediately. 2. Strictly prohibit garrison troops from arbitrarily arresting people. 3. All those transporting firearms and ammunition from various counties without a gun transport license from the Security Headquarters will be detained.</p>

<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Plans Large-Scale Afforestation</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Fuzhou by our newspaper, dated the 18th) In order to revitalize the local economy, the Fujian Provincial Government has formulated a large-scale afforestation plan with the goal of mobilizing the people of the entire province to implement universal afforestation.

<h3>Hankou City to Dig a Canal</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Hankou, 20th) In order to reduce the threat of annual floods, the Hankou Municipal Government has decided to dig a canal along the Zhanggong embankment during the dry winter season. The canal will start from Zhangjiagang on the Xiang River and end at Zhanjiaji, where it enters the Yangtze River. The total length is 24 kilometers, and the width is provisionally set at 2 meters.

The Canal Engineering Office has been organized, and the survey has been completed. Construction is scheduled to begin on the 24th.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Highway Bridges in Northern Jiangsu Were Destroyed</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Zhenjiang by our newspaper, dated the 19th) The Tongjian Road, including the Dingxi Gate Bridge, Caonian North Bridge, Zangjiashe Bridge, Jiulian Bridge, Tianxia Bridge, Xinhe Bridge, and Bazao Bridge, have all been burned by the communist bandits. The roadbed of the highway from Fuan to Liangduo, Dingxi, to Cao'an has been dug up and destroyed. The destruction between Yancheng and Funing is even greater. The Jiangnian to Hai'an highway has also been dug up and cut off. The Highway Bureau is mobilizing for emergency repairs.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to Director Dong of the Construction Department, the emergency repairs of roads in northern Jiangsu total more than 6,000 kilometers, and about 200 bridges are being rebuilt or rebuilt.

<h3>Election Activities in Taiwan</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Taipei by our newspaper, dated the 17th) The provincial capital has not seen clear skies for half a month, as if it were the rainy season, but the election activities have not been affected in the slightest. The election atmosphere in Taiwan province is quite normal due to the balanced intellectual level of the voters. According to the three supervisors sent to this province by the General Election, the number of voters in this province is very accurate, and the roster sent to the General Election Office was also the earliest in the country, and the election methods are also more appropriate. There are a total of sixty-eight National Assembly candidates in the eight counties and nine cities of this province. Later, due to President Chiang's instruction that "suppressing the rebellion is more important than elections," some candidates voluntarily withdrew, and there are currently sixty-one candidates competing. Taichung and Tainan, with large populations, each elected one female representative. There is only one female candidate in Taichung, Guan Tie, who is almost certain to win. In Tainan, Yang Guo Xing, Chen A Xiu, still have to compete. The most common method of campaigning is to publish advertisements in newspapers, explaining detailed experiences in "like-mindedness," and printing the name on a zinc plate to win with its small size and conspicuousness. Some even write "A newcomer appears! A man with hot blood!" like a movie publicity advertisement. Regardless of their status, eight or nine out of ten appear with a bold and decisive attitude. The second is broadcasting speeches, neglecting the "XURA". The province's electrification education is developed, and this method is still effective. The third is posting slides, colorful and beautiful, which is a considerable investment. The "Constitutional Advancement Association" organized a "Policy Presentation Speech Conference," and the enthusiasm was not diminished by wind or rain. The regrettable thing is that "election offices" for individuals have appeared in some places, and the Provincial Election Office has now banned them to avoid confusion. This also shows the enthusiasm of the provincial compatriots for the election. Although Taitung is remote, there are as many as nine regional candidates, the highest in the province. Many indigenous compatriots cannot write Chinese characters, and it has been stipulated that the administrator will write on their behalf. Currently, the atmosphere of the election is quite tense. If God blesses us, there will be many wonderful scenes, which can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Forms a Price Investigation Group</h3>

<h3>Mu Qiujie, Director of the Salt Affairs Administration, Talks About Sichuan Salt</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chengdu by our newspaper, dated the 17th) Mu Qiujie, Director of the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, has visited Zigong, Leshan, northern Sichuan, and eastern Sichuan during his trip to Sichuan. After returning to Chengdu, he discussed with Chairman Deng and Speaker Xiang again and again, and is confident in saving the Sichuan salt crisis. Before leaving, he told reporters that Sichuan salt is not only the largest special product in the rear, but also supplied the whole country during the Anti-Japanese War, which made great contributions. The central government will definitely fully support it to become the largest and most advanced salt production industrial zone in the country through industrialization and scientificization. Mu said: The issue of salt loans and production relief has been negotiated with the Four Allied Banks and Two Bureaus, and the total amount is determined to be 290 billion yuan, which will be distributed to Zigong, Leshan, and northern Sichuan salt fields for increasing production, improving technology, and providing relief. As for the issue of export sales, the sales of Sichuan salt are currently very good in Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, and Kang provinces. Although transportation is not smooth due to the suppression of the rebellion, the future is still promising. Mu finally talked about the fundamental way to resolve the Sichuan salt crisis, which is that salt industry personnel, labor and capital should cooperate, recognize the difficulties, and rely on their own efforts. The government is determined to fully support it to embark on the path of collective production, scientificization, and industrialization.</p>
<h3>Keelung Port Enters the Rainy Season and Exports Decrease Daily</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Taipei by our newspaper, dated the 18th) Keelung Port, which has entered the rainy season for half a month, has seen an imbalance in its import and export trade. According to statistics from the Port Bureau, imported goods such as bulk oils, beans, fertilizers, chemicals, and bean cakes totaled 13,212 metric tons. Exported coal, fruits, tea, sugar, timber, canned food, cement, and timber totaled 4,949 metric tons, a difference of 8,263 metric tons. The port's imports and exports are sufficient to reflect the province's economic prosperity and decline, and also sufficient to illustrate the province's low production, with exports decreasing daily. However, according to sources, the actual amount of exported goods restricted by unilateral regulations in Taiwan Province is not as small as the figures show. Smuggling is still rampant, making it impossible to collect statistics. Director Li of the Keelung Port Affairs Police Bureau said: Currently, the port police have neither the strength nor the financial resources to cope with sea patrols. The people of the province are all hoping that the authorities will have a comprehensive plan to strictly prevent smuggling, strengthen production, and expand exports.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Revises Curriculum Standards: Elementary Section to be Officially Announced Next Month, Secondary Section Nearing Completion, University Section to Remain Temporarily Unchanged This Year</h3>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th) This newspaper has repeatedly reported on the Ministry of Education's revision of curriculum standards for schools at all levels. Here is the latest update:</p>
<p>Elementary School Curriculum</p>
<p>The revision of elementary school curriculum standards has been repeatedly conducted through meetings of experts convened by the Ministry of Education. To gather diverse opinions and strive for excellence, the Ministry continues to consult with experts and refer to their opinions. The relevant department and staff have also continuously researched multiple times, and the entire elementary school curriculum standard for each subject has been finalized. The full draft is currently being printed and is expected to undergo a final review by the relevant authorities within the Ministry by the middle of next week. After being approved by the Minister, it can be officially announced in mid-December of this year. It is heard that there are often misunderstandings outside, thinking that the curriculum standard is based on the standard of class, in fact, the so-called standard is not to make the curriculum, only for the outline, the standard is a standard rule used in general, local governments may formulate relevant courses in accordance with the local environment. The standard set by the Ministry is only a general outline, which is quite flexible, and separate implementation measures are prescribed, so it can be used flexibly not only in the inland provinces and cities, but also in the border areas and even overseas Chinese areas, all of which can formulate courses that adapt to the environment based on the principles of the curriculum standard. External criticisms suggest that the curriculum standard of the 31st year is not as good as that of the 25th year because the 31st year was during the war, and in many places, due to insufficient talent, they could not choose suitable teaching materials and compile ideal courses. Feeling a shortage of books, the Ministry had to make some mandatory provisions in the curriculum standard. This time, the spirit of the 25th year is adopted and improved, so the new curriculum standard is relatively appropriate.</p>
<p>Secondary School Curriculum</p>
<p>For the secondary school curriculum standards, the Ministry of Education previously divided the more than ten secondary school subjects and invited experts, five to seven for each subject, to hold departmental meetings in the Ministry to revise them. After the revision, a circular was sent to each expert for their signed opinions. The Ministry of Education is still continuously organizing the opinions returned by the experts. It will be completed before December 10th, and then educators actually engaged in secondary school education will be invited, along with one or two experts in each subject, to hold a comprehensive meeting for the final decision.

<h3>The Board of Directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury Decided to Keep the Current Lending Rate Unchanged, Non-Essential Loans Will Be Stopped Across the Board</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20] The 357th board meeting of the Four Banks Joint Treasury was held yesterday morning at 9 a.m. Deputy Chairman Zhang Qun acted as chairman, and many important cases were passed at the meeting. Secretary-General Xu Bolan received reporters at 2 p.m. and answered many questions from the reporters on the spot. The key points are recorded below: 1. In the past two months, exports have exceeded imports, and the trade situation has gradually improved. 2. The news of the reorganization of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee is purely general rumor. 3. Regarding the current lending rate, after discussion by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, it will not be changed for the time being, and the following four principles have been decided:</p>
<p>A. The main purpose of adjusting interest rates was originally to avoid unnecessary lending and tighten credit, but adjusting interest rates has its advantages and disadvantages, so it still needs to be carefully considered.</p>
<p>B. In order to tighten credit, considering the current economic environment, it seems that all non-essential loans should be stopped across the board.</p>
<p>C. For matters related to national economy and people's livelihood, state-owned and private production and sales, and transportation public utilities, it seems that they should be allocated in a planned manner according to actual needs, and should be assisted by national banks. A detailed plan will be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>D. Regarding the control of deposits and remittances of administrative agencies and public institutions, the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Audit Department to stipulate strict assessment and punishment measures, and effectively implement them.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The deposits of the same industry absorbed by the National Bank have reached more than 100 billion yuan so far. The interest on the deposit is 8%, the period is 10 days, and the unit of money is 100 million. It is rumored that the interest rate will be raised. The bank said that there is no need to change it at present.</p>
<h3>Three Ways to Eliminate Black Market Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20] Xu Bai, the secretary-general of the Ministry of Finance and the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks, said in response to reporters' inquiries about finance and economics on the 20th: In the past two months, the situation of export exchange settlement has obviously improved. The foreign exchange received by the government exceeds its expenditure, and although the amount is not very large, it is the fact that receipts are more than payments. There is a distance between the current listed market price and the black market price, and overseas remittances have not been absorbed much, which is also one of the reasons. The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank attach great importance to how to improve the exchange rate and absorb foreign exchange, and this situation is expected to improve recently. As far as the current foreign exchange policy is concerned, it will not go beyond raising the listed price and lowering the black market price. As far as the latter is concerned, the black market is an illegal act, and if the government makes a decision, it is expected to lower the black market in fact. According to his personal view, there are only three ways to seek equalization: 1. Strictly prohibit smuggling, so that the market does not need black market foreign exchange. 2. Strictly investigate illegal transactions of gold banknotes, and do not allow them to be raised arbitrarily. 3. Provide the necessary supply for normal foreign exchange needs on time. If these three points can be achieved, the government can control foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Lateral Estimation of the Amount of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>The reporter asked Xu to publish the current amount of legal tender issued in China. Xu replied laterally: Pulit recently said that 250 million US dollars can be used to recover all the legal tender. If this 250 million is calculated according to the black market, it is more than enough to recover the current amount issued. Even if it is calculated at the official price, the difference is not very far. If my issuance is announced, some people will definitely find it hard to believe. Some people advocate announcing the amount of issuance, and that is the reason. Some people think that the country's expenditure this year is less than 50 trillion, which is surprising. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that the expenditure is 30 trillion, which is already difficult. It can be seen that the general impression is not entirely consistent with the facts. Xu also talked about the merger of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury. He believed that this matter was worthy of study, but there were many difficulties in implementing it at present, so he was not willing to make a conclusion.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Allow the Relaxation of Scale</h3>
<p>Xu also answered two inquiries related to Shanghai. 1. The Ministry of Finance is studying the issue of discounting current day bills. It will be announced soon. 2. Various chambers of commerce requested the National Bank to relax the scale of re-mortgages, but the government is now trying to tighten credit, so this point is difficult to allow. The key to this matter does not lie in the scale of the actual value, but in how it is used.</p>
<h3>The Four Banks Strengthen Their Institutions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20] Xu Boguo, Secretary-General of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, announced on the 20th that in order to strengthen the control of the market finance, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has decided to reorganize and strengthen the organization of its institutions in Shanghai, so that they can always be in a position to supervise and connect various businesses of the local national banks. It was also decided to invite President Zhang of the National Bank to take charge of the command and supervision nearby.</p>
<p>Xu also announced that since July this year, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has jointly organized a loan inspection and audit team with various banks, which has inspected more than 100 factories in succession, including more than a dozen industries. According to the investigation report, the funds released by various banks are all used appropriately.</p>
<p>In addition, the loans approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury are all in accordance with the regulations. Government agencies or public opinion institutions can check the loan situation handled by the national banks at any time if they want to understand it.</p>
<h3>Responsible Person of the Equalization Committee Talks About Foreign Exchange Adjustment Strategy to Promote Exports and Fight for Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] It has been rumored that the foreign exchange policy will be changed and that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee will be reorganized. The reporter specifically visited a responsible person of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee yesterday. According to his talk, he has not heard of the reorganization of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, and repeatedly emphasized that the foreign exchange revenue and expenditure of the Fund Committee have been balanced in recent months, and there is no need to change the foreign exchange policy. As for raising the foreign exchange rate, it aims to promote exports, fight for overseas remittances, and reduce the excessive profits of importers. Because domestic prices and black market foreign exchange are rising day by day, importers obtain cheap foreign exchange to import goods, and sell them in the market to make profits. Overseas remittances also tend to the high-priced black market, so foreign exchange must be adjusted at any time to improve it, but it is definitely not to follow the black market. He also answered various questions from reporters: 1. The recent rise in black market foreign exchange is due to the southward flow of capital escaping from the north, which sucks up black market foreign exchange. Absorbing this floating capital is the fundamental way to manage it. 2. Stopping the settlement and purchase of forward foreign exchange makes it impossible for importers to hoard goods for profit, and the government's sale of foreign exchange can have the effect of contracting the currency. The settlement and purchase of forward foreign exchange requires delaying payment for three months, which loses the effect of contracting the currency. 3. The statement that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee cannot supply the approved foreign exchange head position is completely unfounded. The official price of 12,000 yuan of foreign exchange is supplied by the government and has nothing to do with the Equalization Fund Committee. 4. The export trade situation is not pessimistic. After the recovery of Shandong, the export of peanuts will be considerable. 5. The free foreign exchange policy is not inconsistent in economic theory, but the current environment in our country does not allow it. If the government gives up control, it is already unimaginable if there are any rumors in the market. 6. Regarding the US loan, he believes that although China urgently needs foreign aid, it also needs to consider the time of repayment in the future before the loan, and whether or not the loan needs to be decided by the US Congress, and our people's mere hope is of no help to the matter.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Recovers, Foreign Stocks are Mediocre</h3>

<h3>Continuation of Yesterday's Rising Trend. Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Step by Step. Profit-Taking Bulls Emerge. Cloth Prices Decline.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation saw the arrival of personnel from the Simplification Committee to supervise matters in the marketplace. Fellow merchants did not dare to be active. However, the off-exchange market situation, due to the increase in the US exchange rate, stirred up people's spirits. Bidding prices rose step by step, and the situation appeared quite chaotic. Towards the close of the market, the floor seemed to soften slightly. However, as a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to soar by 2.3 million, reaching 46.5 million. 20-count Double Horse yarn also rose step by step by 800,000, with each piece nearing 30 million. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also reached unprecedented peaks. The cotton cloth market, at the beginning, carried on the momentum from the previous day's close, with each type of cloth creating new records. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was pushed to a peak of 1.31 million. Subsequently, those in the industry, fearing the high prices, and those taking profits successively emerged. Furthermore, encountering economic police arriving to monitor the market, the market situation suddenly declined. At the final close, the price was 1.265 million yuan, a drop of 25,000 yuan from the previous day. Other grades of fine cloth also declined by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. However, Chen Chung was uniquely strong, rising by 60,000 yuan. High-grade Prussian blue cloth rose step by step by about 50,000 to 100,000 due to repeated rises in dyes. The remaining cloths had rises and falls ranging from 10,000 to 60,000 or 70,000. Yesterday's spot cotton market, carrying on the rising trend of the previous day, unanimously rose across all grades. Yarn factories scrambled to absorb the supply. Fellow merchants mutually offset each other, and the market situation reached an unprecedented peak.

<h3>Guanyin Powder</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>In post-war China, apart from the people in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, who can barely maintain a living, especially in areas such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, where transportation is convenient, the people are more enlightened, and the ability to survive is stronger, it is still prosperous and consumerist. However, if you go to remote and backward areas or to provinces plagued by natural disasters and continuous warfare, you will often see groups of refugees who are poorly clothed and emaciated, eating grass roots and tree bark. In some places, even grass roots and tree bark have been scavenged completely, and they are digging white clay from the ground to fill their stomachs. They call it Guanyin powder.</p>
<p>Guanyin powder is a slippery, fine clay. Its composition is silicon hydroxide salt or contains aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, etc. It has a fatty texture and a certain flavor. According to documents from various countries, the indigenous people of tea islands in Southeast Asia, a tribe along the Orinoco River in South America, and black African tribes also have records of eating soil. This so-called Guanyin powder clay has a milky white appearance, so in the past, people in places like Germany and Finland were curious and spread it on bread to eat it. However, from a medical perspective, eating soil certainly has no nutritional value at all. For hungry people, it is completely used to fill the stomach and relieve hunger, that is to say, to eliminate the empty feeling in their stomachs. In 1923, Mr. Puchner of Germany also recorded that wild animals in remote mountains, such as wolves and deer, would also climb to find white clay to fill their hunger when they were extremely hungry.</p>
<p>Speaking of white clay, it has many wonderful uses in medicine. In the past, in many places, when new medicines had not yet developed in the countryside, when encountering patients with opium poisoning, white clay was used to absorb toxins in the stomach and intestines, probably because it can prevent the rapid absorption function of the intestinal tract and help the excretion of toxic substances. At the same time, it can also be used to treat diarrhea, dysentery, worm dysentery, etc. We still use this method sometimes now. Mr. Sandeith recorded that Egyptian natives ate clay from the Nile River with lemon juice to treat vomiting in pregnant women.</p>
<p>Going back to ancient times, the famous Western physician Galen also studied the therapeutic effects of clay from a certain island. Later, this belief was once lost. It was not until the end of the last century, that is, in 1898, that Luo Shi once again recognized the therapeutic value of white clay and kaolin. He advocated its miraculous effect on vomiting, diarrhea, or cholera. Even today, doctors still use white clay to treat gastrointestinal diseases. For example, when using aluminum hydroxide powder to treat gastric ulcers, it can cover the damaged surface of the gastric mucosa and reduce the irritation and pain of gastric acid. Silicon hydroxide is used to absorb toxins from intestinal bacteria and protein decomposition toxins from feces, reducing their toxic effects. Also, because these clays are not absorbed by the intestinal tract, they can help with bowel movements. In this way, the clay of Guanyin powder cannot be said to be absolutely useless.</p>
<h3>General Assembly of the Physicians' Association</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shanji</p>
<p>The Shanghai Physicians' Association held its autumn general assembly at the Municipal Gymnasium at 9:00 am on the 16th of this month.

The above two cases were discussed together, (Resolved) Approved for immediate action.</p>
<h3>Bleeding from the Female Genitals</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Why do I use such a title? Because I often encounter women who come for treatment, and when they have blood flowing from their genitals, they always think it is menstruation. In fact, menstruation and bleeding from the genitals are two different things. Although menstrual bleeding also flows from the uterus, such bleeding belongs to the physiological aspect of women, and it recurs every month in a regular manner. Apart from such formal, regular menstruation, if there is blood flowing from the genitals, then it is called bleeding. Why do I want to tell everyone the difference between menstruation and bleeding? Because menstruation is a normal thing for women, medically called a physiological thing; bleeding is something that should not happen, medically called a pathological thing. Women who do not understand the difference between menstruation and bleeding often mistake pathological bleeding for menstruation, not only failing to receive proper treatment, but even delaying the time for treatment, leading to regrets.</p>
<p>So, what are the causes that can cause bleeding from the female genitals? It's a long story, so I can only explain the simple and most commonly encountered diseases; ulcers of the vulva, lacerations, ulcers of the vagina, vaginitis, lacerations of the vaginal wall, erosion of the uterine cavity, etc. In such cases, because of the tissue ulceration and inflammation, blood often flows out, especially during labor and sexual intercourse, there is more bleeding. If the patient herself is not careful, she may mistakenly think it is menstruation, which would be completely wrong, and she would lose the opportunity for correct treatment. In addition, in cases of polyps of the uterine mucosa, endometritis, uterine fibroids, and abnormal uterine position, the bleeding often occurs at the same time as menstruation, causing an increase in menstrual blood volume and an extension of the duration, sometimes not stopping for ten and a half months, or bleeding once every ten to fifteen days. Patients often mistakenly think it is menstruation. The most important thing is cancer. In women over forty, if menstrual blood suddenly increases, or in women after menopause, menstruation returns, which is commonly called "reversing flowering," it is actually not menstruation, but because of uterine or vaginal bleeding caused by cancer. I once wrote an article "The Terrible Uterine Cancer," published in this magazine. Cancer should be treated early, and if the opportunity is lost, there is no hope of saving it. Acute salpingitis, ovarian tumors, ovarian dysfunction, etc. can also cause bleeding.</p>
<p>The above is about bleeding in gynecology. Regarding bleeding in obstetrics, for example, abortion in the first or second month of pregnancy may be mistaken for menstruation by inexperienced women. If the remnants after an abortion are not completely removed, it can cause post-abortion endometritis, with continuous bleeding, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, and even affect the whole body, causing a sallow complexion, weakness, and lack of strength. There is also a condition called ectopic pregnancy, where the fertilized egg does not develop in the uterus, but grows in a part outside the uterus. The most common is tubal pregnancy. The fallopian tube is a narrow tube that cannot accommodate the gradually growing fertilized egg, and it will rupture. In addition to lower abdominal pain and internal bleeding, there is also uterine bleeding. If the patient is not aware of this, she may mistakenly think it is dysmenorrhea.</p>
<p>The above is a brief explanation of the bleeding diseases in gynecology and obstetrics. I hope readers will regard menstruation and bleeding as two different things. At the same time, when encountering abnormal bleeding, you should find out the cause and seek medical treatment quickly.</p>
<h3>About Vitamins (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yin Jiting</p>
<p>In modern science of the past ten years, perhaps nothing has attracted more attention than vitamins. The advertisements in newspapers and magazines are all focused on them, and they have become the darlings of the times that people pursue. They have a close relationship with life, and who doesn't want to be healthy? Coupled with the promotion of pharmaceutical companies, many people have been led astray and are blindly abusing vitamins.</p>
<p>The birth of vitamins was conceived as early as the nineteenth century. In 1880, the Russian chemist Lunin, while working in the Physiology Department of Basel University, fed mice with a mixture of casein, fat, and sucrose. As a result, they died in a short time. However, if they were fed only milk powder, they could live longer. He believed that in addition to the known elements, milk must also contain other elements, and these unknown elements must also be indispensable for human life. In 1897, the Dutch Eijkman, while serving as a prison doctor in Java, saw that the chickens in the prison were fed with the leftover cooked white rice from the prisoners. After a long time, they suffered from paralysis. After an autopsy, there were no bacteria that could cause death. Since it was not an infectious disease, he turned his attention to the variation of food. He tested it on poultry, and it initially developed polyneuritis, followed by paralysis and death. Later, Fraser and Staiten of the Malay Peninsula continued to test it on humans, and they also obtained the same results. Thus, the reason was clear. It was only then that it was known that in addition to protein, fat, and carbohydrates, food also contains elements indispensable for life. It was not until 1911 that the Dutch chemist Funk named this element "vitamin." In the past 30 years, through the continued research of scientists, new discoveries and new knowledge about vitamins have emerged one after another like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

<h3>Jewish Writer Sholem Asch, Winner of the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The Anisfield-Wolf Book Award was established by Ms. Edith Anisfield Wolf of the United States in memory of her father, John Anisfield, and her husband, Eugene E. Wolf. The award began in 1934, with the winner receiving US$1,000. This year's award went to Jewish writer Sholem Asch. The winning work is "East River." The general gist of the commentary is: "East River is a literary masterpiece. It is not only the best work in the novel, but also very sensitive, sympathetic, and has profound analysis. We see the tense relationships between Jews and non-Jews, Catholics and Protestants, employers and workers, and orthodoxy and new ideas, rigor and leniency, freedom and conservatism are also written in it. Through everything, and victoriously overcoming everything, are the basic emotions of all mankind."</p>
<p>Asch's works are mostly published by G.P. Putnam's Sons. In addition to "East River," there are also "The Apostle" (1943), "Children of Abraham" (1942), "One Destiny," "Song of the Valley" (1938), "The Nazarene" (1939), "The Mother" (1925), "What I Believe" (1947), "Three Novels" (1938, including "Uncle Moses," "Three Cities, C. Lederer’s Return," and "Judge Not"), "In the Beginning" (1923), "Mottke the Thief" (1916), "Salvation" (1934), "Three Cities" (1933), etc.</p>
<p>This year's Pulitzer Prize for Fiction was awarded to Robert Penn Warren for "All the King's Men," and the Poetry Prize was awarded to Robert Lowell for "Lord Weary's Castle." However, many publication editors advocate that this year's Pulitzer Prize for Fiction should be awarded to the author of "East River," the Jewish Sholem Asch.</p>
<p>Asch not only writes novels but also short stories and plays. He was born in 1880 in Kutno, a small town in Poland, which was then a territory of Russia. Asch was the tenth child in a small merchant family. At the age of nineteen, he went to Warsaw. The limited education he received in school was only in ancient and modern Hebrew language and literature. He acquired delicate romantic ideas from his mother and self-confidence from his father. He sketched the life of the small town and brought it to Warsaw, and published it the following year. In 1904, he wrote many lyrical essays and published a book called "Dos Shtetl" (1905). This depiction of the semi-pastoral Jewish small-town life represents a kind of romantic realism, different from the realism of Mendele Mocher Sforim and other old Jewish writers—with the exception of Y. L. Perez, the father of Neo-Jewish Romanticism. In 1906, he wrote the lyrical drama "Moshiakh's Teauth," and in 1907, he published "Der Got Fun Nekome," followed by many other plays. These plays were not only performed in Jewish theaters in Europe and America but also on stages in Russia and Poland, and even Reinhardt performed his plays on the Berlin stage. From then on, Jewish literature was recognized by the world. Asch's novels and plays have been translated into Russian, German, Polish, English, and various other languages. His freshness, humor, and warmth are all reasons for his popularity.</p>
<p>When World War I began, Asch began writing novels. He wrote about everything from thieves and basement figures to revolutionary leaders, martyrs, and saints. The characters he writes about are all warriors who struggle internally and seek liberation. For example, "Der Got Fun Nekome" writes about a group of criminals whose souls struggle and finally gain strength from God.</p>
<p>Asch's most abundant novel is the trilogy "Three Cities" (Farn Mabb, 1927-1932). "Salvation" (Der Tilim Yid) puts all the themes of the author's early novels into it. "The Nazarene" (Der Man Fun Nitseres) is a sequel to "Salvation," set in ancient Judea, writing about the legend of the establishment of Christianity. "The Apostle" only has an English translation, which tells the story of the life of Saint Paul.</p>
<p>In 1932, Asch was elected as the honorary chairman of the Jewish Congress. In 1937, the Jewish Theological Seminary of New York awarded him an honorary doctorate in Hebrew Literature.</p>
<h3>Advice to Young Women by Robert Herrick</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhen Qin</p>
<p>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,</p>
<p>Old Time is still a-flying;</p>
<p>And this same flower that smiles to-day,</p>
<p>To-morrow will be dying.</p>
<p>The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,</p>
<p>The higher he’s a-getting,</p>
<p>The sooner will his race be run,</p>
<p>And nearer he’s to setting.</p>
<p>That age is best which is the first,</p>
<p>When youth and blood are warmer;</p>
<p>But being spent, the worse, and worst</p>
<p>Times still succeed the former.</p>
<p>Then be not coy, but use your time,</p>
<p>And while ye may go marry;</p>
<p>For having lost but once your prime,</p>
<p>You may for ever tarry.</p>
<p>[Robert Herrick, English poet, born in 1591, died in 1674. He was a Royalist lyric poet of the 17th century, exiled for seventeen years during Cromwell's rule until the restoration of the monarchy. This poem was first published in the poet's "Hesperides" in 1647, but as early as 1640 this poem had been published in another form. The original title was "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time."

<h3>City Sketches</h3>
<p>— Yin Pei</p>
<p>Philosopher of the Streets</p>
<p>At the crossroads, there is a philosopher of the streets. He has a very beautiful signboard with the following words: ——Good at observing people's expressions, able to know the past and the future...</p>
<p>So, people believed him and stood in a circle around him, listening to him cleverly answer every question.</p>
<p>Everyone got a solution and left.</p>
<p>But the philosopher of the streets always has a question mark in his heart.</p>
<p>Singing Girl</p>
<p>The song of a girl accompanied by a sanxian floats over from the other side of the wall. It is late at night, and the heat and noise of the day have quietly hidden away. This lewd, but also desolate, song is like the mournful chirping of insects in late autumn, telling countless past, sad stories. I imagine an anemic girl, weakly opening her pale lips, forcing a clumsy smile, selling her soul to earn a meager living.</p>
<p>The girl's voice is sweet, but the girl's youth is bleak.</p>
<p>The singing stopped, and the sanxian sounded lonely in front of my window. There was a faint sound of footsteps, knocking on the loneliness of the night.</p>
<p>The sound of the sanxian faded away.</p>
<p>My reverie was drawn even further.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>As I listened to this explanation, my mind was looping through memories when I suddenly saw Yaoqun raise his hand in a gesture of stopping, meaning to tell me to pay attention. When I saw this gesture, I quickly pricked up my ears to listen, thinking that the whistle was starting again, but after listening carefully, I didn't notice any sound at all. I had just heard a faint sound that seemed like withered leaves falling when I saw a flash of light in the room, and Little Tiger had already leaped into the door like a flash:</p>
<p>"Uncle Shen,... Aunt Ji,..." Little Tiger was breathing slightly.</p>
<p>"Take it easy, child," Yaoqun waved his hand, telling Little Tiger to take a breath.</p>
<p>"Uncle Shen has squeezed that 'Variety Show,' and wants her to arrange a few cars so that we can all walk to Dagu. Do you know...?" As Little Tiger said this, he blinked his big round eyes several times, hoping that we would give him an answer.</p>
<p>"Know what? Who's going to Tianjin?" Yaoqun asked Little Tiger, but without waiting for him to answer, he turned to me and said, "Look at this kid, he's so incoherent, he starts the story from the end, as if we're all gods, omniscient..." Yaoqun said, unable to help but laugh himself. Ding Yuan, who was on the haystack in the corner, was also awake and rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p>"Tell the story from the beginning, child." I looked at Little Tiger, who was a little embarrassed, blinking his eyes constantly. Afraid that he would be shy, I eased the situation for him.</p>
<p>It turned out that when Big Fool returned to the "base camp" just now, he ran into our quartermaster, Monk Du Er's wife, "Fierce Yaksha" Liu on the way. Big Fool asked her what was going on. She said, "They can't spare their hands, one is on guard, and one has to listen to the news." "They" referred to by Liu were Du Er and her nephew Liu Wu. Liu then told Big Fool that Liu Wu had just received an urgent telegram from Beiping, saying that Tsurumi had already arrived outside the customs, and at the latest, in one day and one night, and at the earliest, this afternoon, he would arrive in Tianjin, hoping that our people here would meet in Tianjin. The matter was very urgent and important. Liu Wu was flustered after receiving this urgent telegram. Fortunately, when Big Fool went back to get food for the first time, he inadvertently explained our location, which was in the mountain depression under Shuangyang Bridge. Since Du Er and Liu Wu couldn't leave, Liu had to "grope" her way here.</p>
<p>Because the matter was so urgent and he was afraid that Liu's report was inaccurate, Big Fool turned his army back to the "base camp," first read the telegram, and then talked directly with Beiping. After clarifying everything, he went on his own initiative to Yaoqun's temporary office in Shuangyi Bridge and asked Buyi Sa'fu to arrange a few cars as preparation for everyone's departure. Buyi Sa'fu was not as agreeable as he had hoped and only kept asking Big Fool, "What do you need cars for? Where are you going?" In a hurry, Big Fool took out his pistol and forced Buyi Sa'fu to make a phone call.</p>
<p>Buyi Sa'fu certainly didn't fall for this and used her skills to take away Big Fool's pistol. Fortunately, our heroes from outside the pass, Lao Long and Wu Rui, were also there, so they also brandished their weapons, and only then were they able to force Buyi Sa'fu. However, Buyi Sa'fu repeatedly demanded to hear the "captain's" (i.e., Yaoqun) order before she would obey. The matter had reached a deadlock, and Big Fool didn't dare to leave, so he used a whistle to transmit the sound from a distance—because Buyi Sa'fu was very fierce, and he was afraid that Lao Long and Wu Rui wouldn't be able to restrain her, and an accident would happen. The "Variety Show" that Little Tiger mentioned was the nickname he gave to Buyi Sa'fu because she had some ambiguous tones.</p>
