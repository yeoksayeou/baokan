<h3>中共雖拒絕參會呼籲　政府計劃不變更　繼續進行起草和平建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京八日電〕共產黨機關報解放日報社論，斷然拒絕參政會和平呼籲，使參政員擁護和平運動之熱忱，為之氣沮。接近政府之人士稱：此可體實共黨傾向於奪取政權，如去年和談中斷後毛澤東所間接宣布者。渠等指出，現已明自，除非發生奇跡，不能恢復中國和談，因中共最後之目的乃一黨　權，而非多黨共仝參加政權，此與性界各地之蘇維埃政治形式相同。又據觀察家稱：預料共黨之態度將不致影響下次國務會議中政府所提出討論之新和平建設之計劃。此將為政府以政治手段解決內爭，對共黨所提出之最後和平行動。政府對此之立即反響，乃為繼續進行起草和平建議。據內長　厲生稱：政府並不因共黨廣播之結果而修改其計劃。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞在美廣播演說　我盼美財力援助　促進經濟復員農工增產</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日電〕我駐美大使顧維鈞，今晚廣播稱：若干國家「似正實行不吉祥之擴展及控制政策」，使目前不定局面，長此延宕，並阻止復員復興之早日完成，致恢復世界安全和平與繁榮，不克實現。顧氏係按美國家廣播公司每週廣播節目，與印度駐美大使又里參加討論」亞洲在世界問題中之責任」者。渠謂：中國亟欲自美國護得財力上之援助，以促進經濟復員及增加農業工業生產，中國並無利用外援而應付政治上類如平衡預算等之用途，中國之急於加速其經濟發展，亦因中國在世界和平之環球防綫中，據有一最富戰略性之前綫也。美國經濟力量鉅大，當應善盡援助責任，以使愛好自由之民族，能恢復並改進其經濟環境也。顧氏並謂：世界問題中，經濟方面與政治方面者，關係極為密切。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盤頓七日電〕顧維鈞博士今日演說時曾稱：「中國人民對聯合國組織之動機有深切之信仰，中國認為聯合國仍在由幼年至成年之長成時期，在聯合國能切實保障世界之安全與和平前，仍須改善其機構及設置必要之工具，故安理會對管制原子彈及其他集體毀減武器，組織國際警察，建立軍事基地等問題，應擬就令人滿意之解決方案。安理會對於普遍裁軍問題，尤其對有効之監督與管制須獲致協議」。</p>
<h3>當局着手安定經濟　軍費將力求撙減　徵財產稅原則大致决定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕自給自足將為我今後財政政策最高指導原則。就中央方面，軍費將力求　减，各種事務費將儘求其减縮，新機構擬不再添設，凡無利可岡之新事業，將不舉辦。又目前各　國營事業貼補，佔國家支出總數中之比數相當鉅大，此種以「全國人民負担减輕一部份人納　一之舉措，殊欠合理，嗣後將逐步減少，地方方面除若干貧瘠省份，今後中央對地方財政亦不再貼補，務期地方財政能達到自給自足境地。與節流相輔而行者將為開源。此事之進行將較　　略進一步。開源節流工作完成後，當同對整個經濟之管理與安定，即可正式具體着手</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕當局鑒於軍費對平衡預集關係重要，而國防部長又非全國經委會當然委員，商討時諸多隔閡，因之擬將全國經委會組織法予以修改，將國防部長列為該委會當然委員</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕徵收一次財產稅原則，大致已決定：（一）財產評價工作，由各地民意機關協助，（二）征收機構委託當地行政機關代徵，（三）徵　對象，對物對人兼用，（四）稅率財　數額超過某特定限度者，採累進方式，（五）財產範圍，土地房牽及國人在國外存款及資產。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕關於國外存款資產處理問題，外交談判迄未停止，過去之困難在外國　行不肯披露在戶名單，當局現正設法對此類存款及資　課征財產我，此事與征用性質不同，交涉可望成功。</p>

<h3>盟國對日和約條款　美政府將提建議　和會召開日期尙未決定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕據消息靈通之官員稱：美政府現對日本和約條款之建議，業已大部完成，一至國務卿馬歇爾認爲時期成熟時，即將開始與有關各國提出會商。據渠等稱：美國對和會召開之日期，和會之程序，以及和約草案綱要等各種難議，無疑在今夏可提交　東主要國家，但其確期尙未決定。</p>
<p>美官方預料對於和約中之領土解決問題，將無何種困難。渠等相信大部份國家將同意於雅爾達協定中規定蘇聯統治千島列島，南庫頁島，及彼茨坦協定中規定日本戰後國境，限制於其木土之內。又信各國對美國統治冲繩島及其他前屬日本島　，美訊爲對其太平洋防衛綫所必要者，將不致引起嚴重之爭執。惟關於日本經濟問題，以及關於經濟上，政治上畏期管制日本問題，預料在各大國間，將發生各項重大歧見，舉例言之，預料中蘇二國，對日本經濟，願其保持較低於英美所欲其保持之水準。對於長期管制日本問題，據信：中，蘇，澳洲三國，對於管制之形式，程度，以及時期，可能與英美大不相同，惟美國官員間之意見，認爲所有一切問題，比之歐洲條約，更易解決，因關於遠東領士問題，並無相距極遠之歧見存在故也。</p>
<h3>日圖恢復對外貿易　擬在和約訂立前訂外匯率</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京八日電〕日本商界人士私盼日本能仿義大利之例，和約訂立前，以臨時外匯率爲　礎，進行恢復對外貿易。關於此事，吾人尙可一述日本官方人士之希望，即渠等希望對日和約，能仿封義和約之方式而訂立，最近當地英文報紙「日時報」，曾刋載對義和約全文，題係「試採」性質。日本貿易家及工業家，均以極大熱誠，瞻望對外貿易之恢復。茲於美國貿易代表團蒞臨之際，東京一地於上月有大規　之生絲展覽會，其後不久，對外貿易發展協會，對外貿易協會，對外貿易發展委員會，及貿易協會，即聯合組織貿易協會，硏究戰後對外貿易之遠景，並爲將來作有若干計劃。上週日政府曾設立一委員會，以研究國際貿易規章，官方人士，及商界人士，即忙於各種活動，冀重行開放對外貿易。但據記者　日本貿易局官員方面獲悉，彼等對日本對外貿易前途，則抱謹愼態度，且强調和約尙未訂立以前，管制貿易原則，不致有所改變。同時商工業協會以各貿易公司爲對象，進行調査結果，顯示大多數皆極盼首先與美國及中國，次而與南洋各地，先後恢復貿易，日本願出口之物品為織維，茶與化裝品醫用器械，並希望機械。蔗糖：木漆。脂肪。油類，及機械工具等物進口，商工業協會正着手籌備建立東京對外貿易大樓，展覽日本產品。</p>

<h3>疏濬蘊藻浜蘇州河　滬市府提案獲通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕全國水利會議通過滬市府之提案，有疏濬蘊藻浜及蘇州河，並開築上列二河之連絡水道，俾內河貨船逕出吳淞口轉接海運案。該案內容如次：</p>
<p>理由：査黃浦江，蘊藻浜曁蘇州河（吳淞江）並稱爲本市一等幹河，蘊藻浜出口處沿浦一帶之深水岸綫，為外洋船隻優良碼頭位置，亦京滬綫終點輪執聯運站，上游自大塲區之北部經寳山邊境入嘉定縣，可溝通太倉常熟水遝；蘇州河經眞茹區入嘉定，崑山，可　吳縣，　昔該二河船隻　比，貨運暢通，近數十年來，淤寒日甚，河床狹窄不堪，僅賴大潮汎時可勉强通航，致滬市一帶米糧接濟頗受影響。又査蘇州河自曹家渡以下，各式船隻　集河面，水上交通幾無法維持，亟宜設法疏散，如上游能循支流駛入蘊藻浜，直　聯接海運，則費浦江之上中段碼頭擁擠情形，亦可改善。上述兩河，可以利用自蘇州河木潰港口，經楊樹湳西義　接通蘊藻浜舊有之河道，加以開寬濬深，最爲適宜。</p>
<p>辦法：上述計劃在本市轄境內者，計有蘇州河長二十六公里，蘊藻浜一五·五公里，聯運支河一六·六公里，如於低水位時維持二公尺水深，則所需工款照目前物價計算，約達八十一億元，擬請於中央水利經費項下，補助四十億元，以便即時舉辦，並希於本市轄境以外，由蘇省水利機構同時疏濬，以暢航行。</p>

<h3>越盟共和國總統　胡志明發表聲明　盼各國予以道義援助</h3>
<p>〔路透社西貢七日電〕越盟共和國總統專函答覆記者之書面問題，表示法政府如能發表關於越盟之明晰的新宣言，如英政府對印度及緬甸所發表者，則法越談判之恢復，必能爲之便利不少。胡氏並曰，越盟問題並非法國國內問題，故於必要時，越盟當向聯合國大會提出此一問題。胡氏於述及諸强之態度時謂，中國視越盟如兄弟，美國態度友好，英國則或保守中立，胡氏繼聲明，承認越盟之統一及獨立，乃談判之最低限制要求。所謂統一，係指聯合交趾支那安南及東京組織單純統一形式的政府而言，此三邦每邦均得設立自治政府，直接受中央政府之控制，並對其負責。所謂獨立，乃越盟人民有不受外界協助自理事務之權之謂。越盟政府不能允許僅由東京安南兩部合併，而交趾支那則待八民投票決定。胡氏又曰，法方曾謂與胡志明成立解決，將使蘇聯在越取得立足點，其實純爲一種藉口，蓋蘇聯在一九一六年猶未存在，而法國之統治越盟則已有八十年之歷史矣。胡志明個人或係法西斯份子或孔夫子之信徒，但越盟政府則具有各黨派以及無派之代表。胡氏繼又輟斥法方所稱，目前之動亂係渠發動之說，謂越盟政府渴望和平，因此已廢止最高抗戰委員會，並發動三年復興計劃，惟在統一與自由獲得以前，越盟人民當繼續從事奮鬥。胡氏最後發表吿世界人士之宣言，內稱：世界民主人士必須團結一致，以保護大小各國之民主，使大西洋憲章及聯合國之憲章所保陣之權利，得爲各民族享受。亞洲的兄弟們，盼全力援越盟同胞之獨立奮門，越人有賴於諸君所能給予之道義上及物質上的支持</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>杜魯門主義與遠東</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統昨午在坎薩斯城發表演說，重言聲明美國對於領導世界各國人民走向永久和平之途徑，具有絕大決心；並謂美國實應保持强大，開發天然資源，改善農業曁增加生產，俾使美國能以最大的援助昇予急需各國。同時又閘明所謂杜魯門主義，謂美國之責任，乃在採取援助遭遇不幸而企求自由獨立之各國人民的方式，領導世界各國人民，締浩世界和平。美國海陸空三軍必需保持强大，但自德日投降以來，美國軍隊逐漸復員遺散，對於視愛好和平國家荏弱爲招致侵略之各國，不啻予以鼓勵。最後結論稱，世界各國人民，均應接受「如無誠意，即無和平」一項原則，美國應保持强大並應具有信念，以盡美國之職責，此乃美國之義務也。</p>
<p>我們聽了杜魯門總統的這一篇演辭，就想起前天美國合衆社華盛頓的電訊，大意略謂：「杜魯門總統可能於最近數星期內，重申美國之對華政策，蓋因蔣主席擴大政府基礎之工作，已有若干成就，故美國進出口銀行五億貸款之陣礙業已掃除一空，馬歇爾國務鄉對此亦竭力主張，渠深信美國及早援助中國國民政府，實爲得策」。這一個電訊，雖爲合衆社記者漢士萊個人的臆測；但是現有各種跡象足資證信，杜魯門總統確重言聲明美國對華政策的必要。</p>
<p>從遠處看，歐洲政局日趨惡化，匈牙利的政變，是蘇聯一手造成的，不僅匈國的內閣更迭，而且還連牽及許多註外使節，顯然是蘇聯對巴爾幹半島所採取政治計劃的一部份；其次是保加利亞。反對派領袖貝特柯夫的被捕，保國京城無時不在風聲鶴唳之中，反對派報紙且受政府的壓迫，隨時有發生政潮的可能；此在羅馬尼亞也有同樣的情形，蘇聯在羅國採取高壓政策，可能也演出與匈國類似的政變，美國對於蘇聯干涉他國內政，不能熟視無睹，自不待言；開美國對於匈國政變即將向蘇聯提出抗議，並要求調査匈國此次政變的眞相。由此可知，美蘇關係，已演變到短兵相接的階段了。</p>
<p>其次再看美國，最近美國在內政外交方面，有三件大事，最値得吾人之注意：（一）馬歇爾國務鄉要求國會繼續援助歐洲戰災各國，不以援助希土兩國爲止境；杜魯門總統於五日向報界聲明，決不放棄援助外國之計劃。（二）美國參議會對於對義。羅·匈·保·芬五國和約，意見雖極紛歧，但所有修正案均被參院否決，最後卒以七十九對十票之多數，予以批准；此五種和約，一俟法蘇兩國批准之後，即可正式發生效力，美國共和黨與民主黨仍能和衷共濟，採取兩黨一致之外交政策，於此可見一斑。（三）國務院於六日要求參衆兩院將總統戰時權力之一，即政府管制出口貿易之權力，延長一年，俾將美于國境內現仍稀少之貨物供應若干急需之國家。</p>
<p>由上所述，可知最近美國內政外交，無一不在實行杜魯門主義，論理美國積極加緊援助中國，本來是不成問題的，美國進出口銀行的五億貸款，早就可以貸於中國，用之於復興建國的大業；但是爲何至今尙未能實現呢？這是非常明顯的，就是杜魯門主義實施的範圍，僅限於歐洲，中國還在其實施的範團之外，誠如前天英文大美晚報的社論載稱：『截至目前爲止，以杜魯門主義爲骨幹的美國政策，尙未將中國列入其實施的範園之內，美國對華政策，自馬歇爾元帥離華返國以來，一直陷於停頓的狀態。』同時又據該報總編輯高爾特自美返滬談稱：「美國對中國之見解，尙無根本的改變，美國本身雖有許多困難問題，對於中國所遭遇之禍患，仍極表示同情；但最近的趨勢，在情緒方面已不及從前的敏感。一般人士咸以爲由國之友以及中國本身，在戰後均已鑄成若干錯誤，此積錯誤均需要反省，今後吾人所當爲者，尤應顧及現實主義，換言之，唯有在有效之處，始能界予援助。』</p>
<p>但是杜魯門主義在本質上，即具有世界姓的，其實施的範圍，本不應該以歐洲一隅爲限，否則杜魯門主義就要失去其統一性。何况今日中國的情形，和杜魯門總統所關明其他國家的情形，初無二致。第一，中國經過八年抗戰的煎熬，早已民貧財盡，元氣大受損傷，急需外國的援助與接濟；第二，中國人民無不企求和平民主與自由，並竭誠希望採取革新與復興的方式，能建設一個自由獨立的國家；第三，中國目前最大的危機，乃在遭受共產主義的威脅，故中國需要美國的援助，最爲迫切，甚至在希土兩國之上；第四，在現行國際環境之下，國際的關係日趨密切，世界早已不可分割了，杜魯門主義果眞基於和平與正義，則美國對於中國所採取的政策，更不能舍杜魯門主義而方他了。</p>
<p>要之，杜魯門主義推行及遠東，此其時矣！美國對華意見的不一致，造成今日的靜止狀態，爲遠東永久和平計，同時也爲美國本身的利益計，美國決不能聽任這種局勢長此機續下去，所以合衆社記者調杜魯門總統將於數星期內，重言聲明對華政策，不僅有其可能性，而且也有其必要！我們且在這裏，靜待着杜魯門總統發表重要聲明！</p>
<p>財產稅草案的缺點</p>
<p>前直接稅會議時，有人提議開徽財產稅，我們即嘗指出。（一）技術上太困難，（二）結果恐仍不免以不動產爲主要的對象。現聞此項方案，已由財政部擬就，將提交十日召開之全國經濟委員會討論，而其所擬標準六項，其（一）（二）兩項，完全爲不動產，（四）（五）（六）三項，一部分爲不動產，其純屬動產者，祇有（三）外匯一項。此與我們的預測，可稱大致相符。</p>
<p>這理由很簡單，我國現在，速戶口。土地，都還沒有準確的統計，個人財產，是向來諱莫如深，秘而不宜的。政府方面，也沒有辦過任何形式的調査。不動產一項，所征房捐，田賦，等等捐稅，雖不無征册可査；但册載花戶，泰半並非眞實姓名，而各地辦法，又未必一致。兵燹以後，即此不完整的征册，亦多散失不全。不動產情形如此，更何况其他動產？頗聞當局對於此事，原有普遍先辦調査之議，事雖迂緩，辦法却很正當。乃此次急就成章，避免上項手續，自係爲應付當前事實起見，或不得不然，可是失出失入，畸輕畸重等現象，事實上恐無可倖免。瞻望前途，實不勝把人之憂。</p>
<p>自開征財產稅之議發表後，社會上表同淸者，確也不少。最近參政會並有此項議決案，見諸報端。我們在根本上，自不欲再持異議；惟細察擁護此說之主張，其重點多在「有錢出錢」這一點，就是要豪富階級，多盡點納稅的義務，其特論不可謂不公，部定六項標準，其（一）（二）（五）（六）各項，都定有開征的起點，凡不及所定起點的，當然可以免征，其見解亦可稱相同。所成爲問題的，能是動產避匿，很難稽考；凡是眞正的豪富，其現金與細軟，遠則美洲，近則香港，早有了安頓之所。且（三）外匯一項，似乎當局也已聲明，外交上不易辦到，實際形同虛設。那末，所可徵收的豪富財產，無疑地已落在第二第三流以下，核諸原來宗旨，縱非大相徑庭，總也要大打折扣了。</p>
<p>地產一項，其起徽點定爲五十畝以上，其眼光也未免局於一隅。因爲北方一帶，比較的地廣人稀，土地買賣，通常以每頃或每方計算。假使照案實施，無異普遍徵收，與原案的用意，未免有所出入。又房屋價値，定爲三千萬元以上，就數字論，雖也似乎可觀，但就時價而論，則三千萬元以下的房屋，在都市中，似已居於少數。况今房荒極度嚴重，房租已失均衡，姑就上海而論，一般善良的業主正在走頭無路之時，而此項新稅，仍祇偏重在房產一業，好像只有房產業主算得「好吃的菓子」，在理論上，似亦終欠圓滿。</p>
<p>現在國庫空虛，不得不以增發鈔票為　補的手段，以致通貸膨脹，民生凋敝，國民經濟，　有岌岌不可終日之勢。如果可以另關稅源，聊資調劑，自然無可厚非；不過部定各項財產稅的標準，其缺點實在太多。所幸現在還是草案，亡羊補牢，猶未爲晚；所望全國經濟委員會必須在事前愼重討詢，再行決定，一則毋使水深火熱之中，更添一擾民的稅政，再則預防一種法令率爾公布，不久又因不勝指摘之苦，遂自己說着確有漏洞，再來修改，以　政府的威信！</p>

<h3>蘇聯向東南歐伸展勢力　英政府檢討對策　美英將取一致外交行動</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕現由英外交部在研究中之美國致蘇　關於匈牙利之抗議書草案，已使英國對中歐及東歐之整個政策，有加以檢討之必要。匈政府之完全改組，保反對黨領袖彼特柯夫之被捕，以及南斯拉夫反對黨領袖郁伐諾維復及羅馬尼亞美干反對黨員之入獄，已使蘇聯在中歐及東歐之勢力進入新階段。外交觀察家相信此等行動，為蘇聯欲於巴爾幹和約生效及蘇軍撤退以前，鞏固該區親蘇份子地位一項計劇之一部份。英國目前應決定者，即為將對嚴重侵犯民主自由之行為，發動眞正之戰鬥乎，抑於正式抗　後再予承認蘇聯勢力之伸張，一若已往然者。英政府對於美國致匈抗議書之決定，將為英國今後對中歐及東歐態度之指示針。美國之照會，聲言將向聯合國機構提出控訴，意在於形式上的抗議以外，對蘇聯之政策從事賣際上的反對。英國如批准此一政策，則對於保加利亞及他國之發展，勢不能採取較緩和之能度。消息靈通方面相信，英美兩國於此將採取類似的外交行動，預料在芷式提出照會以前，美英兩同尙須繼續從事協商。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盤頓七日電〕此間負責外交當局稱：美國就匈牙利最近之發展，擬向蘇聯當局提出照會，在提出以前，將先向英方官員徵求意見。照會之措辭或將因此有所修正，而减少其嚴重性。英方認為目前對該國局勢所採之措施，宜着重於設立三張委員團，以調查匈牙利之整個局勢。照會內容雖並不因此失去其堅決性，然一般均認匈京最近發展之詳細情形尙欠明暸，在明瞭以前殊不宜即行成立任何最後之結論。國務院發言人今日稱，致蘇當局之照會尙未提出，渠亦不知何時始能送出，但於送出以後，英國亦將提出類似之照會。就一般微象觀，美國政府似不擬正式承認匈牙利之新政權。</p>
<h3>奧共黨企圖攘奪政權　美國正密切注視　羅總理抵南都作親善訪問</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎七日電〕維也納方面今日傳說，共黨圖謀控制奧地利政府。匃京方面，英國第二次嚴厲要求蘇佔領當局供給關於匈國共黨奪取政權之情報。多數西方外交家認為近日種種事故，乃史達林對於杜魯門主義的答覆。同時羅國共黨總理格羅柴之訪問南國，與巴爾幹集團在蘇聯堅決控制下之傳說一致。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕政府權威人士今日宣稱：美國現正充分準備，如果必須防止共黨攫取奧地利政府，寂將於棄早日簽訂奧和約之努力。在此種情形下，美國並準備無限期繼續佔領奧國。維也納方面種種報告，指示共黨對目前聯合政府之纖力，已使歐陸局勢傾向於匈牙利與保加利亞兩國事態發展之型式，國務院澦料該一趨勢將蔓延而至捷克</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南斯拉夫京城七日電〕羅馬尼亞總理格羅柴及外長泰泰萊斯哥，本日偕同經濟部長及農業部長前來訪問，本日抵此。南總統狄托設宴為之洗塵，席間格氏致辭稱，羅馬尼亞不欲盼望來自海外之拯救，吾人之力量將確保吾人之獲救，並保證吾人之前途。吾人將與已爾幹各國駢肩奮鬥，以締造並　固和平，吾人若能獲得成功，當能防止戰爭云。</p>
<h3>匈有權與蘇　建友好關係　狄奈發表談話</h3>
<p>〔合衆社匈京七日電〕匈總理狄奈今日對外國記者發表聲明，堅稱匈牙利有與蘇聯密切合作之權利。記者詢以此事如提出聯合國，則匈政府將採何種之態度？狄奈稱，「匈政府決不保持任何秘密，並將在聯合國答極一切問題」。</p>
<h3>匈共領袖掌握大權</h3>
<p>〔聯合社匈京七日電〕匈牙利之實際獨裁者，乃一矮小禿頂之蘇聯將領，厥名賴柯錫，雖僅任副總理，但自六月一日共黨政變，迫使總理那　辭職以後，賴氏已搔最高權力。彼係蘇聯公民，在蘇聯陸軍任副少將，亦為匈共黨首腦。一年前，賴氏曾隨那基赴華盛頓接洽，獲得美國允諾，將德國從匈牙利奪取之黃金，歸還原主。</p>
<h3>匈前總理那基　談政變經過　否認所指控各節</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦七日電〕前匈牙利總理那基今日在此發表談話，對匈牙利最近之發展表示驚異。據云，當余來瑞士渡假時，國內局勢頗為滿意。五月十八日余得匈京來電話，始悉盟管會之蘇聯主席史維鐵杜夫中將已拒絕余之簫求，不願交出前被蘇當局逮捕之匈農民黨秘書畏柯伐克，同時並將柯伐克之口供筆錄，包括指責余參加政變陰謀之部份，供給匈當局。於是共黨領袖兼副總理賴柯錫遂召開緊急閣議，議決促余立即返國。余即覆電已整裝待返，並申明對余個人所指各節為無稽。翌日余再與鐵爾第總統通電話，總統亦囑余返國，並保證一切可以設法。匈駐瑞士公使戈爾登旋來訪，並携留匈友好之函件，勸余勿返。余告以已決定返國，並囑其再電鐵爾第總統，詢問渠致余之警告是否有據。迨余抵伯爾尼，戈爾登即告我以總統亦勸余勿返。五月三十日國務部長巴洛克神父來電，謂如果返匈，中途恐有意外，渠並建議最好由余辭職，以助危機之解決。余則答以所指控各節，並無根據，余並無憲法上之理由應行辭職。但為不欲使局勢更趨嚴重起見，余同意在原則上依據憲法而辭　，故余並未參加陰謀，如有陰謀存在，乃對余個人之陰謀耳。</p>
<h3>英美政治代表　訪晤保總理</h3>
<p>探詢彼特柯夫被捕事</p>
<p>〔聯合社保京八日電〕保政府今日發表公報稱，美英雨國駐保政治代表彭納特與霍納，昨晤保總理狄密特洛夫（共黨），外畏喬奇夫亦在座。英美代表向總理聲明反對黨領袖彼特柯夫被捕，或有「國際重要性」，公報續稱，保國將彼特柯夫交予司法當局，純　內政間題，希望公衆耐心靜待保國最高法院之判決。</p>
<h3>艾登論匈政局</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕前外相艾登今日在　議克發表演說，　匈牙利之事件，為公然而侮　地干涉小國內政之例十。目前以欠缺充分情報，尙不能作最後之判斷。惟該國之事件，　然為企圖於和約生效蘇軍撤退後，在匈設立共產政權之行動。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦事實調查團　離紐約飛往聖城　猶太公會譴責英國政策</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約七日電〕聯合國調查巴勒斯坦委員會各代表，昨日乘坐飛機啟程前往耶路撤冷，因引擎發生障礙兩度被迫折返，本日再度乘機離此，一行共計卅六人，猶太復國運動執委會委員薛托克亦在其內。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖七日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦調查委會今日宣布：德境美軍佔領區各流亡人民收容所之猶太難民二萬零七百廿八人，已申精聯合國機構立即便利猶太人移入巴勒斯坦。事前聯合國秘書長賴伊宣布，英國要求在委員會調查期間，阻止猶太人非法移入巴勒斯坦。猶太公會發言人稱，英國正要求聯合國機構對一種非法行為，加以裁可與合作，不靑使各會員國為其陰謀之從犯，實難令人置信。今日移入巴勒斯坦之猶太人絕無遠法者，禁止此輩移入則為運法云。英國人士聞悉猶太公會此項聲明後，並未立即發表意見。</p>
<h3>西班牙議會　戲劇式表演　通過王位繼承法</h3>
<p>〔路透社無德里七日電〕西班牙下院今日通過王位繼承法，恢復西班牙之君主政體，但批准弗朗哥之繼續為國家之完首，全塲議員均起立歡呼不已。同時西班牙王位繼承人唐瑛之擁護者，則在馬德里發表聲明，表示保王派並不承認此一新法律。政府人士料弗朗哥於七月初，即將以該一繼承法交付公民表決，但亦有認須至夏季以後始能表決者。舉行公民投票之命令，茲已擬具，祗待弗朗哥將軍之簽字。下院議長畢爾波於討論時，為該繼承法辨護，謂環境旣需要復辟，則恢復後之君主政體，必須為　續有在之政權，並足為全國秩序之保障，國王係為人民而設，並非人民係為國王而設。議會茲建議設立愛好和平之政權，以儘量保證不發生革命之危險。渠復曰，西班牙除弗朗哥外，別無其他領袖，故復辟必須與弗朗哥成立協定，否則即不能復辟。當畢氏演說畢，即高聲詢問議會通過此法否，全塲議員均起立答曰是，並為弗朗哥歡呼，達數分鐘始已。</p>
<h3>美將擴大對歐援助　對抗泛斯拉夫同盟</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕此間消息靈通之觀察家於研究馬歇爾國務卿最近對歐洲發表之「團結」呼籲時，即討論美國於今後三年內每年以六十億元援助歐洲復軍之可能性。華盛頓方面相信當前之急需，為協助歐洲補足其貿易額之不足，然後始供應其生產資源之必需，比印所謂各關系國互爰計劃之開端。此間官方希望英法兩國能響應馬歇爾之呼籲，而首先協助歐洲之復興。美國不能公然邀歐洲國家協助足以阻止蘇聯勢力圈內國家參加之復興計劃，然馬歇爾在哈佛大學之呼籲，固明白表示如歐洲能助己，則美國必能立即響應。美國人士深恐蘇聯之外交政策將促成東南歐國家之於今年初夏即結成泛斯拉夫同盟，果爾則美英法　國必須立即對西歐及北歐國家從事復興援助，以資對抗。</p>
<h3>日本贈償問題</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯定特譯</p>
<p>日本究竟將以多少以及何種工業設備閃給它的戰勝國作為賠償的問題，不久便可分曉了。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>由十一國組織的遠東委員會如果不能夠打開目前的僵局，那麼美國就要先發制人，命令麥克阿瑟將指定作為賠償的日本工廠和機器分配與有權申請賠償的各國。因此，日本賠償問題可望於兩個月內得到最後解決</p>
<p>照目前的情形推測，日本必須交出的工廠近乎一千一百所。也許它得保留全部紡織工業以及不敷應用的商船和鐵路設備；可是它必須交出全部戰時工廠以及大部分的鋼鐵，人造油，橡皮，造船及修船設備，機器製造工具和化學原料。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>美國提前解決日本問題，意欲使日本能够自給自足，因此可以减少佔領費用。麥帥相信：倘欲制止目前日本工業生產量的低落，必須從速解決賠償問題。華盛頓和東京的若干美國官員認為日本利用聯合國的延不解決賠償問題，作為日本經濟不謀整頓的藉口。這藉口一旦消除以後，日本只好實行必須要的經濟改革，竭力發展它剩餘下來的工業。</p>
<p>自從遠東委員會頒發指令，規定日本工業的最低水準以後，日本賠償問題已經大部分確定了。從那時起，佔領當局已把不擬作賠價用的工廠加以旨定，使廠主得以着手恢復生產的工作</p>
<p>（三）　日本賠償問題的最後解決將以一九四五年鮑萊所主持的美國賠償委員會的建議為依據，不過原來的建議已經遠東委員會加以若干修正。　關於要求賠償各國應得日本工業若干的問題，遠東委員會刻正設法獲致一項決議。這是一個引起極大學執的問題，除非迅速解決，美國將以主要佔領國的資格實行分配。</p>
<p>要求賠償的主要國家有中·英·法。菲律濱。澳洲。新西蘭。印度七國。美國不擬向日本要求任何工業賠償，但或許將要求若干工業，以供復興朝鮮美佔領區之用。</p>
<p>要求賠償的次要國家有：曾經參與保衛香港的加拿大；在大戰未期派遣空軍小隊至遠東的墨西哥；曾對日作戰若于日的外蒙古；太平洋屬地遭受損書要求賠償的葡萄牙；因太平洋戰爭這受船舶等損害要求賠償的希臘。挪威及義大利。</p>
<p>日本賠償問題的延不解決，蘇聯應負一部分責任，因為它曾堅持東北九省入於蘇軍掌握的全部日本資產應認為「戰利品」而與賠償有別。東京的佔領當局估計蘇聯所已掠奪的日本資產，價値近乎二百萬電。</p>
<p>美國指定賠償總額中百分之三十，先將拆遷分配於日本侵略戰爭中受害最慘重的遠東各國及殖民地。美政府在訓令麥帥開始分配時，特別强調應將可以立刻供作救濟用的項目先行分配。</p>
<p>在先期分配的賠償中，中國可得百分之十五，或約一百大十五所工廠。但中國政府堅特要在最後解決再獲得百分之十五。</p>
<p>百分之五將分配於菲律濱。荷屬東印度·英屬緬甸·馬來·香港及婆羅洲。　澳洲和法國對於分配辦法嘖有緊言。澳洲主張它應得一份以補償日軍在新幾內亞所致的糧害，法國認為它應得越南的損害賠償。</p>
<p>七個聯合國團體已經在日調查可供賠償的工業。美國當局至今還沒有接到指定某種工廠或機器的正式要求，由此可見日本工廠在今後幾個月內不會開始拆遷的。</p>
<p>拆遷工廠的最後決定權操於麥帥手裏。麥帥目前所抱的政策，是保護日本的必要工廠，在它的設備和工人未曾移轉到他處以前，不准拆遷任何工廠。故澦料賠償問題的最後解決辦法，不致嚴重影響日本的經濟。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾擬向衆院提出　流亡人民入境案　主張四年客許四十萬名移入</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕據悉　　馬歇爾及其總兩　員將出席衆院司法委員會，　請衆院通過　許四十萬流亡人民移入美國之立法案。該立法案現由司法委員會研究中，大部份委員皆表示反對該法案之目前形式。該立　案係案議員史泰雷頓所提出，在四年內每年容許十萬名流亡人民移入美國。衆院某議員稱：馬歇嗡將在小組委員會向大會報告該立法案之後，出席衆遼報告。陸軍部長柏劉　及檢察最克拉克亦有出席衆議院之可能。據小組委員會少數委員談稱：被等對該法案之報告殊表樂觀。傳若千委員正在考　減少流亡人民入境之數目，及縮短允許入境之期限。　護該法案之人仕表示恐懼稱：若國會不能通過該法案，則其他國家必將不參加解決現在歐洲數百萬流亡人民之計劃云。</p>
<h3>美援助希土計劃　羅斯福已創先例</h3>
<p>美駐希代表波爾德宜稱</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約七日電〕美前物價管理局長現任美總統對希問題特派調查員彼爾德本日在自由黨領袖聚餐會致辭稱：故總統羅斯福在其一九三七年十月間所發表之演說，業已為今日援助希土兩國計劃創一先例。余對於杜魯門總統之援助計劃，極為贊成，良以此項計劃，可使希臘建立政治自由，並使該國免於侵略之恐懼故也。但現行希臘政府，不乏貪污與反動份子，亦為不能諱言之事實。要之，美國之孤立派人士，亦應向愛好和平之民衆呼籲，使其明瞭若不實行社魯門總統之計劃，即無和平可言云。</p>
<h3>華萊士演說</h3>
<p>說明對民主黨態度</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社蒙高馬利城七日電〕美國前任商務部長華萊士，頃在此間發表演說稱：余至一九四八年是否這出民主黨，此際尙難斷言，如若民主黨將成為一代表戰爭與不　氣之政黨，則余當不能再予以技持。杜魯門主義並非基於一種和平計劃，而基於一種　爭計劇，如者長此以往，且將擴大，其結果所屆必引導吾人走向不景氣云。至此有人以組織第三黨是否可能為問，華萊士當即答日，凡為余所認為和平所必要者，余均將為之云。</p>

<h3>前法公董局　外幣存款爭執　法領署函請理小組　希望繼續協商解決</h3>

<p>清潔工作</p>
<p>（一）淸除垃圾：本市每日垃圾產量，平均約為二千五百噸，戰後人口增多，而清道夫僅有三千五百人，加之物價高漲，預算不敷應用，在這樣困難情形之下，一年米清除之垃圾量，共達九十萬噸。（二）淸除糞便：本市每日須由淸潔所淸除之糞便，平均達七·三一五車，惟因車輛破舊，碼頭年久失修，工作頗受影響，現正計議招商承辦，以求改進。一方面仍有紋於市民重視公德，共保淸潔，始克有效</p>

<p>同濟勝市西　第二塲同濟對市西，兩隊作風相似，微有「硬派」意味，同濟之郭開東劉錫嘉，市西之霍景輝薛沛然等，均大顯身手。郭下半時「赤脚」大戰，更見威猛別緻，上半時十五比十四，下半時十八比十七，結果三十三比三十一同濟淘汰市西，最後數分鐘，尤為緊張驚險。</p>
<p>粵東勝復興　第三塲復興對粵東，復興未到，好容易六戰六勝獲分組冠軍，決賽總冠軍時反告棄權，殊為可惜。</p>

<p>第三節局面平均各得六分，末節初崇德仍領前，最後三分鐘時十九比二十，市一猛追，石宗蘭罰中成二十分平手，　校啦啦隊極力打氣，耳為之聾，石　國中，反以二十二比二十超出，崇德李惠珍一球又成二十二分平手，繼李得罰球機會，因過份緊張未入，最後二十秒鐘祟德吳兆瑞犯規，石宗閘罰中，市一即以此寳貴之一分，勝第一次決賽二一十三比二十二分。</p>

<p>次幕老閘對盧家灣，不啻為晨友與仁餘之戰，盧家灣區黃存瑞連擲破籃，首開紀錄，老閘區自吳成章罰球得點後，全長春沈鵬舉張顯崙等，均有妙中，盧家灣區傾全力反攻，黃存瑞王炳福周乾堃傅其俠等，稍見活躍，上半時完畢，老閘區以二十四比十五領前。易籃再鬥，盧家灣反攻，一度以二十二比二十七接近。奈黃存瑞王蓉生相繼被罰離塲，遂為老閘所乘。時間完畢，老閘以三十九比二十六克服盧家灣，獲得決賽權。</p>

<h3>經濟部長談燃料問題　已擬定補救辦法　紡織調節會短期內即可成立</h3>

<p>陳氏於十一時接見各報記者時稱；此行目的在視察經部之附屬機構並與各負責人談話。截至今日，有數事可奉吿：（一）燃料問題，因來源困雞，甚形嚴重，本人已與徐樂天氏祥加商討，擬定補救辦法，故目前不致有大問題。（二）政府已決定成立紡織調節委員會，以代　過去之紡管會，本人此次來滬，已與鄒榮文先生三度治商，鄒氏為農業專家，對紡織事業又有研究，故敦請其担任主委之職，絕本人面請後，大致已無問題。調節會經本人返京。確定組織辦法後，短期中即可成立。而預料此會成立後，對於我國紗布產銷業務之改進，大有裨益。</p>
<p>（三）昨日午後會與紡建公司各負責人員懇談，各員前曾呈請辭職，經本人再三挽留後，已允繼續負責。束總經理在王前部長任內，對於紡建之發展，卓著勞績。以其經騐之宏富，辦事之負責，將來紡建公司之前途，殊可樂觀。昨日本人曾參觀紡建第十七紡織廠及染織廠，印象甚佳，惟以時間匆促，未得全部視察為憾。（四）六日晚上海經濟部附屬機構主持人，曾假金門飯店公宴本人，上海各負責人均能切實苦幹，殊可嘉許，本人決虛心誠意，實事求是，對於技術人才及辦事幹員，當使其安心工作，如有良好意見，亦願接受。上海地位重要，與經濟部關係密切，希望能得市政當局及工商界領袖之密切合作，使各種經濟問題能有解決，尤以與滬市有關之經濟問題為然。又昨日正午徐寄廣李銘等太市工商界領袖假虹橋俱樂部歡宴陳氏，今日午後四時吳市長茶會招待，介紹陳氏與本界市各人士見面。</p>
<h3>蠶絲產銷協進會通過　委託代收春繭辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蠶絲產銷協導委員會日前召開第六次委員會議時。曾通過委託代收春蠶辦法一種，茲將該項辦法全文，探誌如次：　一·本會為調劑各地繭行收繭用款，特商由中國蠶絲公司向中國農民銀行借款，交由本會所屬江蘇浙江兩辦事處，以供調劑之用。（皖北部分由中國蠶絲公司自行辦理。）</p>
<p>二·調劑繭行用款，以左列兩項為限：</p>
<p>（一）已核定設立之繭行，尙無廠商前往收繭，而設行收繭之必要者。</p>
<p>（二）各廠商繭行收繭用款，超出規定額度，已無餘款可資調撥，且當地尙有餘繭，繭質優良，而繭行設備及辦理均屬完善者。</p>
<p>但各廠商應有繭貸匯款未到，償付蠶農繭款緊急時，得酌于墊借，惟匯到後，應儘先歸還。</p>
<p>三·委託收繭時，應由小組組長，連同代表所屬繭行，收繭廠商，向本會辦事處訂立委託收繭合約，並由各該收繭廠商負責保證。</p>
<p>四·委託收繭數量，由辦事處酌情核定，並視實際需要，隨時核付繭款，至收繭完畢時，如有餘款，應即全部退還。</p>
<p>五·接受委託收繭之小組組長，於領取繭款時，應會同各該收繭廠商塡具領款單，隨附收據一紙，送交辦事處或分區辦事處核明，向貸款銀行支領。除領款單照規定存轉外，收據一紙，應交本會存證。</p>
<p>六·委託收繭之烘折，繰折，及支付繭價，暨一切開支’接受委託之小組，及代辦行莊之廠商，應確遵本會規定辦理。如有　烘舞弊，及其他違背規定情事，各該小組及代辦行莊之廠商、應負完全責任。</p>
<p>七·委託代收之蠶繭，於繭行結束時，應照規定辦法，及實收繭額，比例分配。並於進倉後，將配得乾繭，全部交由中國蠶絲公司收存。　各繭行所收超額繭分配時，應就各該繭行烘成乾繭，總額及所收鮮繭比例，抽籤分配之。其繭價及一切繳用，在規定限度內，亦依此比例分担之。</p>
<p>八·上項蠶蘭，配分於廠商時，其辦法另訂之。但承辦小組及行莊之廠商，得予以優惠，以酬其代辦之勞績。</p>
<p>九·委託收繭應塡送之各項報表，照本會規定辦理，惟須　明委託收繭字樣，以資識別。</p>

<h3>蘇省繭汛　量志質均有進步</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕農經兩部蠶絲產銷協導委員會，前以江蘇各地繭行，業已全部開秤，曾於本月五日，派員至蘇錫等地，視察各區收繭情形。據悉：此行視察經過，一般印象，殊為良佳。繭價自通過照原定價格，增加兩成，每担為一百二十萬元後，繭農興趣倍增，收繭後積極整理桑田，進行施肥工作。目前江蘇已收之鮮繭，已達七萬担，估計尙可收四五萬担。收繭總額，可達十一萬至十二萬担。一俟增加之繭貸五百億元匯撥後，即可全部收足。聞該項貸款，今日即可由中農行匯出。據四聯總處某要員談視察江蘇各區經過。認為除原增貸之五百億元外。尙須車培貸歡三百億元，方數應用，現正由各關係方面，　洽申請增貸中。又按一般　質而言，已較去年提高。各　行烘舊工作，亦較去年嚴密。預計再過三四日，已收之繭，即可全部烘竟。至浙江方面之收繭工作，業已吿一段落，已收鮮繭達九萬餘担云。</p>
<h3>皖北開始收繭</h3>
<p>皖北蠶業今春由中蠶公司輔導，配發改良蠶種，近已開始收繭。中央社記者為明瞭實際情形，特走訪昨由皖北視察歸來之該公司秘書處處長尹良瑩氏。據談：安徵蠶業棄稱發達，抗戰前江浙皖蠶業，相提並論，戰時備受摧殘，僅皖北存留烘繭設備，計毫縣有烘繭灶十二付，今春配發蠶種一萬躉，卑鑷有烘繭灶七付，太和八付，各記發蠶種六千張，蠶兒發育經過良好，業已上族採繭。成績最好者，每盒收繭量　四十斤，普通每盒平均八斤左右，刻在毫縣城郊，軍陽　花廟，太和稅　舖三家烘繭灶所在地，分別設　收繭，卑陽已牧四百餘担，臺縣一百餘担，太和因繭款撥匪搶刧，僅收六十餘担，均仍繼續收購中。預料全部收繭量，當在一千担以上。改良磁價每斤最高為七千五百元，皖北連年黃水泛濫，災重民窮，蠶農沾獲利益，無不喜形於色。尹氏又稱，今春皖北係試辦性質，蠶種量過少，沿途桑葉什九均未採用，殊屬可惜。如在飛　　阜陽，太和，臨泉，蒙城，毫縣，渦陽等縣，發展蠶業，至少須配發蠶種十萬張以上。且皖北係大陸平原，氣候乾燥，人烟稠密，蠶業前途，極有希望云。</p>
<h3>附表（二）類貨品　本埠廠商申請登記　合格總數分類統計</h3>
<p>輸管會對於附表（二）進口商登記審核及分配事宜之聲明已誌昨日本報，茲再將登記合格廠商分類統計（截至五月底止）發表如下：本埠廠商申請總數三六九八家，內合格總數五七七家。華商三七四家，洋商二〇三家。計（一）甲，汽油九家，（華商五洋商四）乙·柴油十八家，（華商十二洋商六）丙·滑物油十八家，（華商八洋商十）丁。礦質或半礦質滑物油膏九家，（華商三洋商六）（二）甲·生橡膠（包括汽車胎在內）三十二家（華商二十洋商十二）乙·橡膠製品（汽車胎除外）六家（華商五洋商一）丙·廢橡皮十六家（華商十二洋商四）（三）紙及木造紙質九七家（華商六一洋商三六）（四）棉花六五家（華商三八洋商二七）（五）羊毛及廢羊毛三八家（華商二十洋商十八）（六）純毛或雜毛紗線二十四家（華商十六洋商八）（七）化學產品一（八）未列名安尼林染料及其他煤膏染料四四家（華商二七洋商十七）（九）人造靛十家（華商三洋商七）（十）硫化元四一家（華商三二洋商九）（十一）金屬品一四四家（華商八八洋商五六）（十二）木材品三八家（華商三一洋商七）（十三）小麥及小麥粉米（糧食部統籌辦理）內小麥粉十八家（華商六洋商十二）米六家（華商一洋商五）（十四）煤及焦炭十一家（華商八洋商三）（十五）蔴一家（華商）（十六）新舊蔴袋三四家（華商十六洋商十八）（十七）皮帶用皮機器帶及蛇管十家（華商四洋商六）（十八）未列名油脂臘十九家（華商八洋商十一）（十九）人造絲六家（華商三洋商三）（二十）水泥十二家（華商五洋商七）（二一）肥田粉二家（洋商）（二二）肥料（無）（二三）漿粉八家（華商六洋商二）（二四）未列名植物性拷皮膏十四家（華商七洋商七）（二五）製藥四七家（華商三十二洋商十五家）（二六）烟梗烟末碎烟廢烟十九家（華商六洋商十三）此外尙有已洗電影片煤油載客汽車糖及烟葉五項之登記事宜，係歸輸入品管理處辦理，故不列入本表。</p>
<h3>產區存棉減少　各地棉價飛漲</h3>
<p>據紡織業消息：本月以來，各地棉花產區之存棉日見减少，以此價格繼續飛漲。據統計，南京之市價較上月漲百分之二百五十三，為漲價最高之一地。重慶漲百分之一百廿九，漢口漲百分之四十六，天津　百分之廿一·匯陽漲百分之七十二，靑島濱百分之一百五十·福州漲百分之一百九十二，昆明漲百分之卅六·即以上海當地面論，價格亦較上月漲百分之九十六。際此新花尙未上市之前，舊花價格如此上漲，紡織業之前途岌岌可危。據關係方面透露，棉花上漲之主因，乃為某方在產區收購甚力，有以致之。</p>
<h3>各地銀樓業代表　昨再入京請願</h3>
<p>全國各地銀樓業，自經濟緊急揩施方案頒佈，禁止條塊買賣，並對飾金亦訂明應照官價格收兌後，即陷於半停頓狀態中。各地代表雖屢次晋京請願，當局迄未有具體改善辦法。茲悉，本市銀樓業公會方面，於昨日由該會常務理事吳彭年姚桂鄉等為代表，再度會合湘，鄂，平，津，新疆，台灣等地代表，晋京作最後之請願。聞本市銀樓業方面，刻已有停閉及改營他業之現象，如次請願仍無結果，各店勢將於節前後全部停頓。</p>
<h3>美金券倆本息　規定兌付期限</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕據悉：財部發行之卅六年短期庫券曁卅六年美金公債，到期本息兌付期限，均自開付之日期至三年為期，茲該部已分電各經理銀行遵照辦理。</p>

<p>〔本報杭州八日電〕近日杭州米市漸趨下跌，距最高峯已低下十萬元，現最高白粳每石卅八萬元。</p>
<h3>東北大豆出口</h3>
<p>五月份達二百餘億</p>
<p>〔本報天津七日電〕東北大豆由秦皇島大量輸出，據商檢局統計，五月份由秦港輸往英荷等國之黃豆，價値共達二百餘億。</p>
<h3>本年浙茶滯銷　浙建廳正謀補救</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州八日電〕浙省本年茶產已陷困境，全省百餘家茶廠，尙未開始收購毛茶。據建廳佔計，本年各地茶產，不及去年。外銷茶共收購六萬餘担，內銷茶五萬担。今年情形惡劣，原因在價格過低，現照上海市價，每祖毛茶在四十萬至五十萬間。而茶農成本亦需三四十萬，茶商因此畏退不收，使全省數百萬茶農咸望茶興嘆。建廳已建議中央，照現在收購蠶絲辦法，由政府按實際成本收購，俾資救濟。</p>
<h3>統一五種公債　定明日帛籤還本</h3>
<p>財政部二十五年統一公債戊種債票，　二十三次抽籤，共十八支，計還本法幣四，六八〇·〇〇〇元。二十七年振濟公債，第十次抽籤，共十二支計還本法幣三六〇·〇〇〇元。三十年建設公債，第二期債票，第八次抽籤，共五支，計還本法幣二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、三十一年同盟勝利公債，第五次抽籤，共四十支，計還本法幣四〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。卅三年同盟勝利公債，第一次抽籤，共六支，計還本法幣三〇，〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>

<h3>高級香烟堅定</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，以永泰和將派五十支茄力克及十支大英老刀三牌香烟，又聞中美烟公司定今（九日）開派「三星。黑牌」二種，且比原有廠盤减低，是以巿勢疲莫能興，塲中交易亦淸。晨初十支大英六百十萬元做開，曾跌小至零八萬元，嗣有零星走化，在十二萬元稍有成交，午後市略趨緊，大英烟做高至六百十三萬元，比週六回好二萬元。但老刀因派貨關係，續跌十三萬元。全日趨勢以高等之大南未大三砲及　商烟熱門貨脚地堅硬外，其徐美麗前門牌及美貨條頭烟，大都繼續趨疲，至五十支裝聽頭烟，固不乏吸收，三五牌茄力克水手等，均見挺俏。</p>
<h3>香港銀行家商討　防目僑匯逃港辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港八日電〕此間銀行家非正式討論有關資金，尤其僑匯逃避香港一事時，曾建議取消現行官價外匯匯率。據悉中央銀行英籍顧問羅傑士，已拒絕此建議，此間銀行家認為外匯官價與黑市匯率，想差過鉅，為僑匯逃往香港之唯一因素。因在香港可以黑市價格換得法幣，此間美鈔黑市價約三萬五千元，各銀行家以為吸收僑匯之唯一辦法，乃採用依供求關係而定之自由匯率。惟據報羅傑士表示，不能接受很等之意見，因官價最近將來，不能調整。渠之意見，認為目前調整外匯，將影響整個國家經濟政策。據悉，馬來亞菲律賓婆羅洲暹羅安南等處之僑匯，最低之佔計，每月當有二百萬港幣，中國政府對此嚴重局勢，採取何種辦法，現尙不知。僉信外傳香港中央銀行內設一金融機構，似即政府所採之辦法。</p>

<h3>重建山東</h3>
<p>— 濟山三日航訉　本蒙特派員麗天</p>
<p>第二　　司令官王　武，兼主魯政後，在軍政一元化下，根據政治軍事並重的原則，手訂山東省三年施政綱領。本年元月又召開綏靖區政務會議，通過了許多切實可行的決議案，製訂了山東省緊急配合軍事要點。這三者，要皆為魯省一切施政的圭臬。半年以來，雖以共軍猖獗，軍事局勢，屢有進退，對綱領推行，頻增困阻，但王耀武仍一本其毅力，從事於新山東的創建。</p>
<p>原來，中央依據人口，賦稅等所訂縣的等級在魯省當前特殊情形下，早不適用，為針對現實，魯省府乃決定依據政令所能推行程度而分為下列五級，即：（一）控制區，（二）半控制區，（三）據點控制區，（四）機動區，（五）淪陷區。規定控制區半控制區設七科，據點控制區設民政，軍事兩科，機動區，淪陷區不設科。此種等級，得視政令推行程度，隨時更改，俾成機動體制，减少人力物力上的困難。</p>
<p>還鄉難民　耕者有田</p>
<p>魯省流亡於省內團軍控制區之難民，據調查為七八五萬七千人，在省外南京，徐州一帶者為一八一萬三千人，其總數佔全省總人口四分之一强。王耀武為此，除向中央請准賑款卅億救濟發放，由行總配撥物資分發各地外，並協助組織自覺自動，自主自治的還鄕團，向中央申請舉辦農貸，請領原料肥料，小型農具，及其他生產工具，資金，以及武裝。有生產工具，他們才能自力更生，有武裝，他們便能自衛。這樣擁有生產組織及自衛組織的還鄕團，不僅可以形成一種游動的生產集團，逐漸的游動到故鄉，而且，必要時也仍然可以武裝地有計劃地再游動出來，避免犧牲，直到地方安定以後再回去。</p>
<p>回到故鄕的民衆，對於原在共軍盤據時留下來的人民，絕對禁止自由報復，並一本實大政策，擴大統一建設運動。所有土地糾紛，槪照中央法令解決，保護佃農，扶助自耕農，切實執行减租减息辦法，實現耕者有其田。儘速成立縣以下各級民意機構，按步實行鄕鎭保長及縣長民選。</p>
<p>槍不離人　人不離鄉</p>
<p>關於重建地方武力這裏需要具體並特別說明的，即魯省在勝利初期，由於對地方團隊的縮編過於嚴格，忽視了山東特具的複雜環境，致無形中在客觀上予共軍以可乘之機，於是政府裁，共軍擴，而中央部隊，又逮水不救近火，一時無法大量運到，致造成今日的局面。王耀武自兼主省政後，在各收復區不使對淸查戶口，編組保甲，健全民衆組織等工作着着進行，尤其對重建地方武力。除省保安團，按中央規定整編外，並按實際需要規定專員區設自衛胞，並先就薔西南各區原有之集　大綠，細觀為八個圖。各縣除警察大隊外，設自衛大隊，區設自衛中隊，鄕設自衛分隊。各隊編組原則上着重在「槍不離人，人不離鄕，及不脫離生產之原則」以加强縣區鄕保之自衛編組及訓練。</p>
<p>增加生產　安定生活</p>
<p>在經濟建設方面，為謀人民生活安定，除首須恢復濺耕外，同時並注意特種經濟作物的提倡。棉產在山東原僅次於陝西，本年在膠濟沿綫及魯西南原有推廣棉田一百萬畝的計劃，現因軍事關係，未能全數完成，又關於推廣美國菸種計劃，本年由省建廳與山東大學及農林部華北推廣繁殖站，在靑島城陽農場合辦育種塲，明年即能得足够五萬畝種植的美國菸種。其他如草帽辮，手工織布　及　憚臨　萊新等煤鐵　產之　誠，亦在着着進行，尤其省境內　　蔽量，在國內佔第一位，只要軍事開展，未來前途，實未可限。此外，如利用救濟物資，以工貸賑，舉辦　運河水利滬溉工程，更隨軍事之進展，以全力搶修公路，恢復交通，皆能與國軍的需要密切配合。</p>
<p>整理財政　嚴禁攤派　縣級財政為解民倒　，與共黨爭民心的關鍵所在，假使這一點不能做好，或者做得不够，一切努力，皆屬徒勢，因此，王耀武自兼主魯政後，視各縣推行政令的廣狹，定淸理財政的步驟，按縣區等級之新編制，核定經費，按期發放，絕不拖欠，一掃過去惡習，以重樹省府信用，一面開征合法稅捐，拓寬稅源，一面規劃統籌辦法，厲行合理負担，澈底根絕額外攤派。關於縣市自衛綴費，規定由統籌委員會統　關支，厲行以來，雖僅四月，但已大著成效。</p>
<p>頻年以來，山東經共黨擊據劃裂後，舊的社會組織已整個解體，不僅政治解體，經濟解體，社會解體，連文化也隨着解體，王耀武自兼主省政後，深知軍事只是治標的手段，根本救治之道，還在乎政治建設興高度的政略攻勢，而政治的根本則在乎新的社會組織的重建。我們眼看着收復區的山東人民，已逐漸能由流亡而安定，由安定而進步，由能够生活進至較好的生活，由能自衛進至能自治。在王耀武領導下，排除一切困難，逐漸邁入民有民治民享的三民主義新山東。這在另一方面，也正說明了共黨的「淸算」，「鬥爭」，「翻身」等恐怖政策的不合國人民性而勢必將遭遇到歷史上無法逃避的失敗後果。</p>
<h3>青島基地的分量</h3>
<p>— 青島四日航訊　本報特派員邵愼之</p>
<p>靑島基地對於一支强大的海軍，有不易估計的分量。</p>
<p>中國目前的海軍有七萬餘噸艦船，如分配在預定的靑島。上海。台灣·海南島等四個海軍基地，那麼每個基地可以泊上不到兩萬噸的艦船。不久的將來，可以自日本接收到三萬多噸。至於美國的西太平洋艦隊，其實力却是捉摸不定，在青島軍港進出的美國軍艦，沒有通知中國當局的手續，青島的中國官員，一般講起來，對此事是不淸楚的。</p>
<p>事實上，中國的靑島基地司令還發表不久，董沐曾上校還沒有到職。駐靑的中國艦隊北巡艦隊，向美軍的倉庫中哺乳油料，開單劃賬，由政府去總算。一條不滿千噸的小艦，航行廿四小時，至少要一千五百加命柴油（我的估計），即使在停着的時候，開一架發電機，每天最少要一百加侖柴油。哺乳海軍並不與哺乳嬰陔同一意義。因為　本上這些艦船並非造自中國的船塢，其境况與空軍實無分別。</p>
<p>如果把靑島基地孤立起來看，它具備良港的要素。五·六·七。三個月有濃霧，最厲害在七月，像倫敦一樣，不辨咫尺，但早晨八時前即散盡，沒有嚴重到白畫開燈行車的程度。在現在的軍事設備條件下，它將不成問題。世界軍事家記為它是世界有數的軍港之一。它自德國，日本推移至目前的情形，也許可以作為地緣政治學者的證例之一。</p>
<p>兩想對峙　牽涉廣　泛</p>
<p>如果聯繫起來看，則問題固然複雜，而眞實的價値却可顯示一二。它和旅大隔一個山東半島和一個渤海口，遙遙對峙，戰鬥機的航程不足一小時。山東半島在中共武裝控制之下，而遼東半島則在國共軍的犬牙相錯狀態中，加以蘇軍和美軍的存在，隱然對峙着世界兩種不同的勢力。環繞在渤海周圍，在北緯三十五度至四十度中間所發生的現象，嚴重地被中國和世界所關懷，發生的問題足以刺激中國和世界。因為牽涉得太具體，而且廣泛了。</p>
<p>與佐世保　聯成一綫</p>
<p>靑島和佐世保可以聯成一綫，恰恰在黃海上和上海構成一個三角地帶。整個黃海在巡洋艦。十二小時的航圈以內。這等於一具緊密的網，扣住了整個黃海。但靑島是一個總樞紐，如果沒有靑島基地，那麼上海可以和佐世保聯成一綫，這樣就等於完全退出黃海。因此，靑島遂成為黃海的象徵。</p>
<p>美籍顧問　不支薪水</p>
<p>美國「訓練中國海軍的基地設在靑島」，海軍軍官學校的美籍顧問有七十人，中國政府並不支給他們薪水，他們專門訓練中國海軍來接收美艦，敎育長魏濟民上校說，有許多美國敎具，我們單是裝置裝置，經費上就有不勝負担之感。訓練的程度，大抵以能够完全自己控制船隻為初步標準。中國海軍算從美國人手裏接收到了兵艦，「並沒有固定的學程」。在上海的海軍軍官學校學生還在陸續來靑，預定在本月中，一百五十八個學生可以全部到達。十二艘船正待交到中國海軍的手裏，過去靑島曾接收三十六艘，而在上海，則曾接收五十艘，加十二艘在內，其總數仍不足一百艘，大約有七萬餘噸。戰前中國海軍十餘萬噸的數字，須待接收日本船艦三萬餘噸來補足了。到那時，或才可稱海軍數字的「復原」。</p>
<p>俄語僑民　繼續增加</p>
<p>通過塔斯社的報導，蘇聯對靑島正顯示着鄭重的注意。另一方面，在靑島的外僑中，以蘇聯人和準蘇聯人（白俄，他們隨時可以入蘇聯籍）為最多。大約有一千多人。與其他三十八個國籍（包括猶太在內）僑民總數幾乎相等。他們隨着美軍陸戰隊的增加而增加，他們操着的職業是一般資本主義國家所有的職業。雖然靑島的「房荒」嚴重，但說俄語的朋友仍有繼續增加之勢。</p>
<p>雷達放射　軍庫轔轔</p>
<p>自海邊埠頭，就老遠可以看到幾個大建築物上的雷達放射器，迎空旋轉。馬路上美軍車軋軋不絕，而最新式的轎車則大抵為中國人所有。靑島市參議會上有一位參議員向市長提出質問，說「美軍登陸靑島共一年零八個月，但死在美軍槍下和車下的市民就有四百多，希望市府想辦法。」市長說「美軍傷人，一共有二百多件，每案都曾交涉過，現在三分之二以上都已解決，三分之一正在偵查中。」質詢的時候，也正是大學路山東大學　得一團糟的時候。這天是「六二」。這天是大打出手。</p>
<p>海水浴塲　定期開放</p>
<p>靑島每天刮着風，搖動窗子，彷彿在預吿你將發生什麼事情似的。美國的水手在馬路上走，中國海軍也在馬路上走，尤其是整隊的海軍學生，穿着得那麼齊整，以寬闊美　的海做他們的背景，令人有一種莫名的激動，也覺到了青島的分量。</p>
<p>盛夏就要到了，外圍每有一次小接觸，即可振人心弦，但今年的海水浴場還是那樣美麗，彩漆油髹的浴棚，爭奇鬥巧，煞費經營，十五日就要正式開放，我有機會將描寫給讀者看。我們有這樣的好浴塲，實在是可以驕傲了</p>
<h3>孔廟　孔林</h3>

<h3>台茶外銷之反響</h3>
<p>— 台北二日航訊　本報記者楊育</p>
<p>在台灣的耕地中，產茶面積是僅次於米·甘藷·甘蔗而居於第四位。五十餘年來在日本竊據時代，台茶的盛衰，對整個台省的經濟，有着息息相關的影響作用。台茶最盛時期栽培面積近七十萬畝，精製茶的生產量約二千六百萬斤，這是日本人領台後二十餘年用機器代替了手工，以殖民地方式經營的結果。積極外銷，展開對外貿易，在當時的世界市塲上，是足以和中國。印度相抗衡，合胞的血汗結晶，却為日本人換來可觀的利潤。直到太平洋戰爭以後，台茶的美國銷路完全斷絕，在民國卅三與卅四兩年，合茶更遭到空前未有的厄運，茶廠停工，茶園荒蕪，茶農失業，現在我們談復興，眞是百廢待舉，一椿再艱巨不過的工作。</p>
<p>茶農有了利潤，製造者也不能不給以保障。所以目下台灣銀行已承辦了茶廠貸款，茶葉公司分得三億元，民營茶廠二億元，資金能够周轉，生產才不致阻滯。去年本省精製茶總產量不過六百萬磅，今年預計可達一千三百萬磅，明年一切順調的話，就不難和戰前年產量二千餘萬磅並駕齊驅了。公司本身的精製茶今年可產四百餘萬磅，佔德產量三分之一，其中一百萬磅的原料侮取給自有的茶園，餘下的還得向民間茶園搜購。公司方面今後還預備進一步的辦理茶農合作社，獎勵茶廠生產。農林企業股份有限公司成立後，茶葉公司也展開募集民股與優先股的工作，這不是與民爭利，相反的是與民共利，公司的收入就是政府的收入，而這收入仍投資在茶業上的。要求合茶有前途，這中間不能有隔閡，只有大家通力合作，公司不以民間的工　作競爭的對象，主要在爭取國際市塲，為臘家換取外匯。記者曾以台茶的外　情形就前於茶紮公司的陶總務主任，他相當痛快的吿訴我，台灣只有　前茶能在美國巿塲上出點風頭，雖然利子簿，但無論如何總維持下去，否則美國人忘懷了烏能茶的香味，再要開　市塲就困難了，台茶外銷以去年十二月底銷往中信公司紐約分公司的一批四十萬磅為　矢，至今年五月才以一一·八五〇元的官價結得了十八萬餘美元的外匯，每磅美金四角五分。所得的反響是：大小樣符合；沒有雜質；香味够標準，所以昨天又有一批七千箱運往中國銀行的美國分行，中信公司已喊出每磅四角四分美金的價錢，但希望還有人出得高一點。</p>
<p>從去年茶葉公司的賬面上看，因為應用了萬存的原料，照着市價售出，似乎賺了點錢，可是再要補充，問題就不簡單了。所以保持品質，把握銷路開闢市場，茶葉公司成為一個開路先鋒。聰說有許多茶商可以瞞過了檢騐者的耳目，以陳茶再製向外混銷，這樣所引起的影響是不堪設想的，等到哀傷到自食其果的時候，整個的台灣茶葉也就會宣吿崩潰。記者常聽到「放遠眼光，拿出良心」的呼籲，為台茶的前途着想，這呼聲是足以發聲振膭，驚心動魄的！</p>
<p>目前茶葉公司正針對以下幾點困難，覓求解救的對策：（一）茶國的恢復，（二）物價影響到生產成本，（三）材料的補充，（四）茶農生活的不安定，（五）台胞不能了解政府的茶業政策。這些問題多是聯賞的，互為因果的，所以要防止整個台茶企業的動搖，從茶園裏生產直到裝運出口，這中間需要一個前後多能顧到的通盤大計，一個確切不移的固定方針。茶葉公司對這一點抱有無限樂觀的信心。</p>
<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>論建國的正道</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>目前全國人民的祈向，在求國內的和平，政治的民主，和經濟的建設；這就是實行三民主義的「救國建國的常道」，因為國內不和平，戰亂無已時，則兄弟圜牆，必招致外侮。於是八年堅苦抗戰，犧牲千萬同胞的生命財產，所爭取得來的最後勝利，名列五强之一的光榮，竟為戰亂經年，和平失望，幾乎遭受莫斯科三國外長會議當作問題來討論的奇恥大辱！今後各黨各派以及全國人士，如再不以國家民族為至上，趕快遵循和平建國的大道，解決自己的問題，則必陷國家民族於萬刧不復之境，成為國際會議討論與處置的對象，革命先烈與抗戰軍民之血將白流，國家獨立與民族自由亦必將得而復失！蔣總裁之所以在三中全會開幕之時，諄諄以「集合全國愛國有志之士來共同奮鬥」相勉，並以「我們在這憲政行將實施的前夕，應該怎樣培養我們黨員恢宏的氣度，和其他黨派精誠相處」為訓。我們果能遵循蔣總裁之所昭示，與其他黨派精誠合作，和衷共濟，相忍為國，奔向和平建國之路，以根絕國際干涉，而爭取民族自由，實現民族主義的理想。這是目前革命建國的主要課題，應該審愼將事，力謀合理解決的。</p>
<p>國民黨為中國歷史最長久的第一大黨，黨內有不少缺點和惰性存在，無容諱言。國民黨自執政以來，黨員能奉公守法，為國為民者固多。但自私自利，憑藉黨員的銜頭，鑽營舞弊，而求升官發財的貪官汚吏亦不少；官吏一貪汚，政治便低能寡效。故欲提高政效，必須肅淸貪汚；欲肅淸貪汚，各級政府須把經濟·行政，用人等都公開。凡是民主國家的政府都有對國民公布財政預算和決算的義務，不但財政數字應該公開發表，其他數字亦應盡量發表，不但數字應該發表，而且一切經濟措施都應使國民容易明白了解而不應帶有　瞞甚至欺騙國民的成分；在任何行政措施決定以前，總應公開宣佈乃至擴大宣傳，使國民了解眞實的情形；政府官吏的進退升降，尤應公而忘私，國而忘黨，選賢與能，定時考績，公開黜陟。這樣一切公開，才能大公無私，肅清貪官汚吏，建設廉能政府，增加行政效率，並實行政治協商會議之一切決議，奔向民主憲政的大道邁進。民主國家，着重保陣人民權利，故須確保人民事有身體。思想，宗敎·信仰·言諭。出版·集會·結社。居住·遷徙·通訊之自由，現行法令有與以上原則抵觸者，應分別予以修正或廢止之，尤須嚴禁司法及警察以外任何機關或個人有拘捕審訊及處罰人民之行為。民主政治，是反映民意，勵行法治，實行民治的政治：故須迅速普遍成立省縣（市）參議會，及縣級以下的民意機關，以表現民意，確保司法權之統一與獨立，不受政洽干涉，充實法院人員，提高其待遇與地位，奉行其執法如山的天職，並勵行監察制度，嚴懲貪汚，而使全國上下皆從法，以勵行法治；積極推行新縣制，完成地方自治，以實現民治。今後國民黨黨員，自應特別順受民意，遵守法紀，勵行自治，奔向民主憲政之路。有志有為有守的年靑黨員，尤應深入民間，做一個健全的鄉村自治員或鄕村小學敎員，忠實的為民衆服務，為民族培養健全的幼苗。如能深入邊疆，做一個邊疆屯墾員，致力邊疆建設，以鞏固國防則更好。這都是當前黨部黨員應取的新動向和新作風。至於黨員成分和素質的提高，則應注重黨員的敎育和自我檢討，自我批判，自我改進之風氣的養成。而其目標則在健康，道德，知識與能力的水準繼續不斷的提高，以及為國家謀建設，為人民造幸福的服務精神之增進。對於訓練民衆行使四權，灌輸民衆政治常識，使全國人民，能够眞正的拿出自己的力量來管理自己的事，達到眞正「還政於民」，走上眞正民主憲政的光明大道，實現民權主義的理想，更是當前救國建國應循的常道。</p>
<p>時至今日，人民貧病交加，苦不堪言。所以我們要革命建國，必須切實實行民生主義，改善人民生活，注意養民問題，而謀足食足衣，富民富國。其實施方法，自當遵照「實業計劃」，製定經濟建設計劃，歡迎國際資本與技術之合作，而以工礦並舉，農商並重為原則。為促進中國之工業化，政府應定期召開全國經濟會議，邀集對發展經濟建設有關的各方面社會人士，吸收民間意見，以決定政府之措施。規模較大的工業而且有獨佔性為私人資力所不能舉辦者劃歸國營或公營，如鐵路，機械製造廠，電氣事業等均由政府主辦。其他規模較小的工業，則訂定獎勵條例，予以獎勵，並受政府指導監督，以達到節制資本的目的。同樣，對於　產的開採，除一部份規定由國家經營外，並竭力獎勵私人開採，因為多採一點擴，建國便多一分力量。如此，一面開採礦產，樹立重工業的基礎，鼓勵輕工業的經營，一面還須發展並改進各地的手工業；至手工業出品的種類，則須擇其需要浩大者，先行設法趕製，政府對於此類工業，尤須加意扶持，促其成功。俾可自給自足。原料如國貨中尙有未備者，可自行研究倣製或改用其他類似之代用品，以儘量不用外貨為第一要事。大宗機器及工業用品，除中國目前無法自行製造者酌向國外購置外，普通機件槪可自造，總以自力創造及改用國產品為原則，俾能開發資源，減低輸入，平衡外匯。此外，對於工業地點的選擇，更應注意及交通與地理環境的是否適宜，因為如果交通不便，運輸阻塞，反使供求不能平衡，且時間與經濟上又不經濟。他如實行勞動法，改善勞動條件，試行勞工分紅制，舉辦失業工人及殘廢保險，切實保護童工女工，製訂工業會法，使經營工業者得有單獨之組織，改進工廠管理法規，以促進勞資合作，廣設工人補習學校，技工學校及工礦研究機關，以提高工人文化永準，促進工礦建設。獎勵科學研究與發明，迎頭趕上歐美的物質文明。這都是促進國家工業化的必要措施。至於農業方面，則須實行减租减息，保護佃權，保證交租，擴大農貸，嚴禁高利盤剝，以改善農民生活，並實行土地法，以期達到「耕者有其田一之目的。尤應墾植全國荒地，開發農田水利，發展農民組織，推行集體農場，實施倉儲制度，設立農業金融機關，獎勵農村合作事業，並注意科學實騐，勵行農業推廣，經營農產加工，以促進農業之工業化。我國農產之輸出，以茶、絲，桐油等為大宗，故茶葉。蠶種，桐苗”須力求質的改進，使能合到檢騐標準，俾國際貿易旺盛起來，因而換取大宗外匯。他如鞏固法幣，平抑物價，改革稅制，根絕苛雜與非法攤派，歸併徵收機構，簡化稽徽手續，以資產及收入定累進稅則，勵行國家銀行專業辦法，扶助工農事業的發展，實行保護關稅政策，管理進出口貨物。促進我國的國際貿易，籌措抗戰官兵之復業與就業，保障殘廢軍人的生活，撫卹並敎養抗戰陣亡將士之遺族，沒收收復區之敵偽一切財產，救濟流離失所的難胞與僑胞，並資助其復員復業等，都是目前經濟方面的當務之急，而為救貧致富的，實行民生主義的，救國建國的常道。</p>
<p>國民健健康，是救國建國的動力，是國家民族最寶貴的資源，所以美國人以健康為愛國的第一件事，英國人亦有「三等體格的國民不能造成一等的國家」的　語，西洋人且常以健康擬諸財富，蘇聯的革命建國，特重衛生，力謀健民，尤為可資借鑑的最近最好的實例。所以我們要建設富強康樂的新中國，必須力謀健民强種；要民健種強，又須注意國民的「育」的問題與「樂」的問題，這就是民生主義於討論衣食住行四大間題之外，尙有「育」，「樂」兩大問題之說的緣故。這兩個問題，民生主義中雖未曾討論，但依作者的管見所及，所謂「育」的意義，就是要全國人民的身心雙方，都有充分的發育，而應特別注意「衛生」和「敎育」兩種事業。</p>
<p>在衛生事業方面，必須普遍醫藥衛生設施，如各種專科醫院，省，市，縣立醫院，衛生院，衛生分院，衛生所，衛生員等之普遍設置，以及衛生材料廠，製藥廠，血淸疫苗廠，衛生實騐所，衛生訓練所等各項衛生機關之大量設置，而完成衛生網之建設，並實行公醫公藥，使全民得免費醫療，以促進國民健康。但醫藥衛生不過是治病防病的，運動則是强身去病的。所以我們欲促進國民健康，必須普及全民健身運動，如普遍組織運動團體，廣設運動塲所並充實其設備，及鼓勵各項運動競</p>
<p>賽，傳習姬合各人身體之運動方法等，以提高全民的運動興趣，而增進其健康。然而有些人，因為父母及祖先有遺傳病，成胎時或分娩後，就得這種遺傳病，我們要高潮減少牠，甚至於根本肅清牠，那就要實行民族優生政策，其方法應由政府設置婚姻主管機關，頒佈獎勵優種增殖之各項法規，規定結婚雙方須交換健康證明書，以獎勵優種增殖，杜絕劣種遺傳。但生出來的健康子女，如果沒有好的生活習慣和鍛鋉方法，不久之後一定也會不健康的，所以必須積極推行衛生敎育，如灌輸衛生常識，訓練衛生習慣，管理衛生環境，實施學校衛生，講究心理衛生等，均須積極進行。一個人的健康與否！無論先天或後天，都和家庭有極密切的關係，因為家庭是生育子女敎養兒童的塲所，也是社會國家的細胞，所以我們必須改進家庭以健全社會，如勵行婦嬰衛生，與家庭環境衛生以及食衣住管理之改良等。各地尤應普設托兒所，幼稚園，青嬰院及兒童保育院等，以實施兒童保育及敎養。並使職業婦女們能於工作時寄養其兒女，以减輕其養育兒童之責任，而增進其假務社會之效能。這都是保育健康兒童和人民應該遵循的常道。</p>

<h3>郁達夫之生與死</h3>
<p>— 孟農</p>
<p>氣　正在劇烈的變動中，這眞不像是初夏，入晚，霉氣也出現了。窗外的蒼綠而帶萎黃的榆葉，不時地隨風飄落，發着噝噝的的單調的落萊聲。我默默地把手裏的「達夫全集」掩閉了，　夢非夢的在沉默中追念起這位可敬悼的一代文豪來！</p>
<p>達夫的一生是完了，他已經在前年八月秋風起時，悽然地被殺害了，正像窗外飄墮在暴雨中的榆葉一樣，而且似乎連噝噝的細弱的呼聲也不曾發出！安特列夫說：「從黑暗裏來，又回到黑暗裏去的人，又被吸到時間的無限的虛空裏去，更沒有一點蹤跡遺留着了。」他難道是變成了安特列夫所指的「沒有一點蹤跡遺留着」的人們中的一份子嗎？也許，這正是道時代文人共同的運命。</p>
<p>達夫的一生是一齣偉大悲劇，同時也是一首壯烈史詩。他的作品，他的藝術——寄托着自己的生命的藝術，正展開在我的眼前，給我以鼓舞，給任何年靑人以新的啟示。因此我更體會到安特列夫所提出的像警吿一樣的那句箴言的眞實意義，因為我的確不能不為那些時間所淹沒的人們歎息，悲哀，他們中間也許有過可貴的思想和情感，可是不幸的是他們都從時間的滴嗒聲中消逝，鐵雨中的榆葉一樣飄落得無影無蹤了，他們不能或者不願留下任何蹤跡。</p>
<p>幸而達夫在他三十多歲，就編訂了自己的「全集」，收集了他在三十歲以前的主要的著作。他似乎不很重視過云，却也並不抹殺過去。他稱自己的全部作品為「寒灰」，為「敝　」，為「鷄肋」，為「斷殘」，為「薇蕨」，同時他感喟着現在，並且永逮地寄希望於未來。</p>
<p>他的過去，是無盡頭的飄零。宣統二年，從故鄕富陽飄零到杭州，在第一中學唸書，老是到當地書舖很多的梅花碑去散步，那時他愛讀的是「西湖佳話」和「花月痕」兩部書。越二年，革命軍起義，省立各校因時局關係停頓，改入敎會學校，但愛讀的仍是些才子佳人的劇曲「桃花扇」和「燕子箋」之類，那年還只十七歲，九月，東渡到日本，拚命用了一番苦工夫。明年春，老人東京一高，從此，他接觸了西洋名着，從屠格湼夫，托爾斯泰，杜斯托也夫斯基，高爾基，柴　甫，一直到德英日法各作家，據他自己說，四年內讀了一千部左右的名著小說。他後來進東京帝國大學經濟學系，但他還是酷愛文學，這才展開了他的創作生　——第一篇出世作，「沉淪」，表現了他的留學時代的一個羅曼緊。後來，雖然一方面被批評察貶為「額屍」，「傷　」的東西，另方面在讀者心裏却获得了事的</p>
<p>民　十一年回國，因為找不　竹产職业。他就開始寫小說，參加组織創造社。翌年，受北京大學之聘，當敎授。廿四年，在武昌大學做敎授，一年後折返上　。此机，南去廣州，北上京華，行色忽忽，幾無寗日，其間雖曾有　作發表，但他自己却說「不曾坐下來做過偉大的東西」。</p>
<p>的歲月在漂泊無定中進入了中華。他希望結束他過去的不安定的生活，他曾好多次想望澹泊溝　之樂：「我衣並不要錦繡·拿也自廿於藜　，可是住的房子，代步的車子，或者至少也必鎭一雙鞋子與襪子的限度，總得有了纔能說話。」（「記風雨茅竊一）他又說：「好遊旅，喜題泊的性情，近年來漸漸地减了；」他「只想不改常態，在家吃點精緻的菜，喝點芳醇的酒，睡睡午覺，看看閑書，不願意將行動和平時有所移易——總之，是懶得動。</p>
<p>戰軍興，他的生活不但不能像他所期望的那樣安定，却變得更顛簸了。繞道入閩，遊宦了一個時期，又轉赴南洋辦報。太平洋戰爭爆發，便於次年二月離星島，逃往蘇島石叻班讓，彭古令小島。改名「張德淸」，做小生意過日子。日本軍人的暴力和恐怖一天比一天猛烈，他便決定潛逃到蘇島西部——巴雅公務，這時他化名「趙廉」，於三十一年九月張羅了一點資本，開設起「趙預酒廠」，其目的是藉此做掩護，並解決一部分逃亡中的窮朋友的生活。但這樣的生活方式畢竟是不能長期瞞過　人的，日本軍憲也許已經知道他就是郁達夫，藉口要利用這位「趙廉」會說一口漂亮日語，便在表而上請他去當憲兵部通　，而在實際上是把他軟禁和監視起來了。被迫充當了通譯，他雖則心有不甘，但亦無可奈何，直至次年二月，他才稱病（肺病）把憲兵部通譯職務辭退了。這一時期，他對營救僑胞確實帮了不少的忙。</p>
<p>日軍投降後，達夫遭到了更不幸的意外事件，這，我也不知道是他的不幸或者還是幸。他在八月廿九日（中央社電訊中作廿八日未知孰是。）突遭日軍逮捕，並「與歐人數名，同時遭槍決，其遺塚在距科克要塞七公里地方。」眞的，達夫在蘇西四年，熟知了日軍的暴行，秘密和情報，日軍怎肯放過他？如果留下了他，不就是留下了活的見證嗎？達夫之慘遭　手，當然是勢所必至的，達夫也許並非不洞悉日本人這種慣用的陰謀毒計的吧。但同時，他也知道捨身取義，義盡成仁之道，大義所在，死亦不辭。這一死，至少證明了他決不是跟一羣俗物在同樣的隨波逐流的浮沉着，而相反的顯得他畢竟是、「個飽　滄　，憂懷家國的現代陝放翁！</p>
<p>話還得說過來：如果他不　被　牲在日軍鐵蹄下，他今年　只五十歲，他定然能鼓其餘勇，寫出一部或甚至好多部有力的作品，給日軍以最强烈的控訴，然而，現在，留下來的，除了這部早年自立遺囑似的「達夫全集」之外，還能有什麼呢？不能，不能，一千個不能！這樣一想，他的全集就是他的紀念碑，至少在我看來是價得追憶，値得撫　，値得抱吻的！</p>
<p>掩閉着的「達夫全集」，終於又給翻開來了。窗外的榆葉還在風雨中，飄着，飄着，跟它伴奏着的是：壁上的鐘聲，滴嗒，滴嗒。</p>
<p>這去是如此　着，現在也是如此響着，將來也還是如此響着。有的作家消逝了，有的作家產生了，而達夫是不朽的。他是勇敢的，同時是聰明的，他在短促的，陰鬱的，空虛的時間中拿他的生命和事業來充實了這時間。他選擇了自我犧牲的道路。他走完了曲折而多變的作家的道路。安息罷，永別了罷，我們的詩人兼小合　！</p>
<p>郁達夫先生在中國新文化運動中已經建立了不可抹煞的功績。就以中篇和短篇創作來說，達夫先生也給了我們很多新的形式和技巧。他有東方文人的風度，西方作家的熱情，瀟灑而憂鬱，可敬又可愛。今年是他逝世的第三年，也是五十誕辰（生日是廢曆十一月初四日）紀念，本刋今得孟龍先生介紹其生與死，先為刊布。將來在他誕辰紀念的時候，還可以請幾位深知達夫洗生的朋友，再寫幾篇文章。（編者）</p>
<h3>十年</h3>
<p>— 成惕軒</p>
<p>簪筆樞垣，忽忽十稔。百城盡在，兩袖風淸。獅子</p>
<p>橋邊，看罷高樓之月；鷄鳴埭畔，重溫瑣院之春。今吾故吾，報國尙餘文字；三十四十，憑君記取年華。用示親朋，藉陳契闊。</p>
<p>十年簡命黍重叨，騎省官淸已二毛（潘岳年三十二，始見二毛，今余又過黃門四歲矣）。佳訊待傳鶯出谷，新居倘比鳳移巢。想看石室蘭臺上，依舊瓊樓王宇高。一念尙難遺郡國，屋梁何日夢縣刀？</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血529</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「他們二位的「電訊」，可是相同？」我感覺十分有興趣。</p>
<p>「那才眞怪！……我們仔細把兩份「靈訊」一參詳，僅有條目的次序不同，內容簡直可說不差毫釐……這倒還不算特別，只那位覺厂老人，除了記明靈訊之外，還附着兩句話。把這兩句話一看，簡直呌我從脚跟直奇怪到腦頂：原來那位老人竟連我們這邊商討的結果，都預先知道了！所以老人說，「靑木長老的計劃，旣與君等所擬方式無甚出入，可以放心進行……」這不是怪事一大堆嗎？……」（鶴見）</p>
<p>「我看一點也不怪！」我瞧着鶴見滿面迷惘，便這麼吿訴他。</p>
<p>「什麼？」鶴見睜圓了眼請。</p>
<p>「我問您，您知道靑本長老為什麼呌萍子定要邀請您一路到上海？」</p>
<p>「那是由於擊破「八之秘密』的工作，萍子辦不了，只有我……」</p>
<p>「却又來！」</p>
<p>「我不明白您這話的意義。」</p>
<p>「節單得很……您剛才不是說過，靑木長老「靈訊」上最主要的一倏是「數的因素」，他說八月一日的年月日，瞧他推算，對於日本出兵，上吉大利。日本人，尤其是那些軍事首腦，迷信之至，他們在計劃侵略大陸之前，必也請星象家推算過；靑木長老，就不自己推算，當然也有消息。所以他推去想來，只有您能利用直接向近衛報吿種種不利於日人出兵消息，才可阻過「八之秘密」的發動。至少可以攪擾他們，把推算出的這個上吉大利的日子錯過……」</p>
<p>「老大哥，您愈紛呌我愈糊塗。您的意思，難這是說靑木長老事前早已佈　　了，這個「八的秘書　」必　　　　　，才能　　？</p>
<p>「　哪！」</p>
<p>「老大哥，您在說鬼話吧……別的我也不去辯論、只說一條。靑木長老，就算他把事情，早已佈置妥當，只等萍子約我去實行。可是我得請問，那樣的電訊報吿，無論我在什麼地方，也都可辦，就說那些電訊，必得由上海南京發出，上海的正岩和南京「〇十六」和田義一，也能照辦，只要我多發幾個電訊就行，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「您認為世上只有你一人　覺，別人都是呆烏？」我解釋着「您的行動，萍子的行動，一切一切，近衛那裏還怕沒有詳細報吿？梅蘭松三組特務的互相攻訐，你嫉我妒，靑木長老未嘗沒有一本詳細的流水賬；那麼，他未嘗沒有預算您和萍子到上海，必有事端發生，您知道他們這回困擾萍子，米嘗不想把您也打在一網裏，只因萍子和您，都沒明白「0915」的命意，您才徼倖做了一條漏網之魚哩——再說。靑木長老算是定你們兩人，一到上海，必有事　發生，這發生事端的本身，就可證實日軍內部的不調合；單單這種內部不　合的消息，一入近衛之耳，豈不</p>
<p>輕舉妄動的　吿？……</p>
<h3>兒童地繪畫</h3>
<p>— 季國屏</p>
<p>兒童的繪畫，這個問題，隨了美術敎育的發展，漸漸為一般人們所注意，尤其是負敎育責任者。在外國有不少學者做過這種研究的工作，如法國勒根斯，德國克生斯提那，日本　岡龜三郎等都有很詳細的研究，奧國的薛石克專為了研究兒童繪盡舉辦了世界聞名的兒童藝術班。</p>
<p>兒童是快樂的，活潑的，對於美術的愛好，可說是一種天賦的本能，所以我們看到某一兒童在執筆繪畫的時候，總是聚精會神，專心一志，充滿着强烈的興趣。但是事實上兒童的繪畫都是不完備，不相稱，無組織，不翔實的。我們不能以成人的眼光去觀察，批評。我們要知兒童的繪畫是有他們的境地，他們的感應，他們的見解。</p>
<p>鹽童的繪畫，有時是有意的，有時是出於無意的。因為凡是發育健全的兒童，總是喜歡東塗西抹，粉筆，木炭，磚片，瓦礫都是他們的工具；地下，壁上，紙面，書裏，都是他們發揮的地方，這是一種肌肉的運動，和純粹的內心運動的表現，絕不受一些拘束和强迫，好像用言語來表白一樣，對於繪畫的目的是完全不計及的。</p>
<p>大概在兒童繪畫的初期，總是出於模仿衝動的。例如他看見人家在寫字作畫，他一定也要拿一枝筆隨意的亂塗了，這完全是一種模仿的動作；除了模仿的動作以外，因為接近的聯想，和相似的聯想，於是繪一隻馬而引起繪了一頭牛，繪一尾魚而引起繪一隻蝦了。更有因機械動作，從繪一個圈繪到很多的圈，繪一條綫，繪到很多的綫；因為這樣，所以他們隨意塗鴉，能發揮着很多的東西。</p>
<p>兒童有保守過去的印象，就是很喜歡繪曾經繪過的東西，他繪過了某稱事物，那個印象就牢牢的記着，不隨便的變更。例如畫一張風景有二個山峯中間一個本陽，隔了好久再畫風景，他這個山峯和太陽不加變更的依然畫上去。他們保守過去的印象，是出於不知不覺的流露，那末可以知道他們在繪製之前確已存有一「內部的印象」，所以他們所描寫的東西，是外界的事物又經過了他們「內部的印象」的組織的再現。</p>
<p>兒童對於畫材的選據又異於成人的，例如繪一間房子，繪了房子的上半部，下半部不繪了；繪一個人，不管遠近大小耳目口鼻一股腦兒都要畫上去，這是在他們認為某處重要和某處不重要，或某一點可愛和某一點不可愛的表現。</p>
<p>所以兒童的繪畫，是聚積了許多外物印象，和種種的內心活動，　　成另一的印象的　　印　向　　　　　　　　形的兒童</p>

<h3>沒有笑的生活</h3>
<p>— 張鳴春</p>
<p>作為人類特　之一的美聲，像　到防空緊急警報的市民，幾乎逃得無影無　了。我們是邊着沒有笑聲的日子。正常的人類生活，必然洋溢着笑聲的。</p>
<p>笑是可貴的。你曾計算過它的功用麼？它是盤根錯節糾紛的融解　，是情人的必備禮品，是商賈般安全的投資，是友誼的觸媒劑，是幸福的介紹人，是健康的大補品，是疲勞的特效　，最可貴而　　的地方，是施興老不花任何眞本，而接受者像獲得一件永建難忘的恩惠。</p>
<p>人間最美麗的物事，要算是各種各樣的笑態吧？「小寳貝讓我來抱抱」，當你要從一位健善母親的手上接抱那婉變嬰兒愛撫時，那小寳貝先已酬答你最天眞可愛的笑容了。</p>
<p>復仇之後的豪俠們，在明月高樓之夜，一壺濁　中的笑聲，會像春雷一樣的雄壯驚人的。</p>
<p>天寒薄暮，征途渺渺，一位旅人，忽聞幾聲不知誰家女郎的巧笑。像紅杏似的竄出牆外，只此小小的客程點綴，也足使寂寞的旅人頓忘跋涉之苦了。</p>
<p>在秋收無事的鄕村裏，你曾看過滿臉　紋的老農們在簷前草堆上晒日黃時的情景嗎？他們把古今的無稽謠傳，當着正史在津津樂道，說到得意處，來一陣與他們生活同樣樸素的「哈哈」。</p>
<p>量廉價的笑聲，莫過於初中女孩兒了，有人說她們每三個人在一處的笑聲，就抵得四月裏三畝田的蛙鼓呢。</p>
<p>誰說好花不常，好夢與好月也不常呢？你沒有看見畫家文西畫的「蒙娜麗莎」的神秘微笑嗎？那不是一朶永遠不褪色的半開花？不落的眉月？不散的輕霞？不碎的好夢？你猜猜，她到底是為的什麼微笑呀？</p>
<p>笑的力量的偉大，無可比擬。一個女人隨意調節着自已笑靨的淺深，能控制另一個人的悲寫的程度。許多鎭定如老僧的，猙獰如厲鬼的，勇猛冠三軍的，富貴過天子的人們，往往對「梨渦」揮動白旗，無條件投降。那些不惜舉烽火來誑諸侯，拋皇位如敝屣的帝王，不是不提便知的好例子嗎？</p>
<p>劣貨幣驅逐良貨幣，關於笑也能應用這定律。那些値得玩味的笑聲，統被惡霸們的「哈哈」趕跑了。今天我們所能聽到的，都是病態的笑，例如強暴者可怕的獰笑，陰險者的奸笑，冷笑，無恥者的謟笑，淡笑，被侮辱與被損害者的慘笑，苦笑，還有各種性質的博徒們的狂笑。</p>
<p>會心的微笑，天眞的憨笑，無所為的快樂的歡笑，都漸遭淘汰了，於是我們過着沒有笑的日子。</p>
<p>廿世紀的笑聲，有如財產，也發生了偏枯現象，彷彿有人囤積居奇似的，獨佔了笑的巿場。他們的笑口張得愈大，別人的哭聲愈高。</p>
<p>你看看那肥頸的肉浪擁出領子外面的仰頭大笑者的得意相！</p>
<h3>蕉陰凝坐</h3>
<p>— 張大千</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>敬謝「謝罪團」</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>片山哲又在高唱中日合作的老調了，還說想組派「謝罪團」來中國謝罪，「代表日本人民對日軍在華之掠奪行為，向中國人民道數。」如果我們不健忘，東久彌宮任目相時，亦曾有過類似之計劃，不過因為當時遭到反對派的阻撓，未曾實行而已。日本當局一面以「敗而不慘者」的身份，向勝利國頻送秋波，什麼「恩重如天」呀，「情誼隆重」呀，「仁厚寬大」呀，等等，脅肩諂笑地將勝利捧到了天上去；一面却積極提出計劃書，要求有移民台灣的特權，要求與美國共管琉球，要求繼續托管各小島嶼，要求工廠的生產力量達到某一標準，要求有十萬大軍的警衛力量，……顯然，日本自有其如意算盤。「東山再起」的夢，是日本人民所念念難忘的。說遠一點，請看正當投降時，日皇的勅書和鈴木內閣的文吿吧：他們都僅僅提出將近四年的「大東亞戰爭」，却默默地抹煞了八年來加在中國人民身上的大血債；說近一點，多少日本人在親暱地和你握手過後，便會輕描淡寫地說：「日本並沒有發動什麼侵略戰爭呵！」</p>
<p>內心裏是倔强與竊笑，外表却儘量在作九十度鞠躬，這就說明了日本人是處在微妙的兩極上。他們竭力希望別人寬大，因此也不得不竭力壓抑自己。</p>
<p>他們在玩什麼把戲呢？無他，說穿了，仙們一面是想在盟國的統治下抬頭；一面却在肚子里說：十年以後咱們再拼過！</p>
<p>看目前局勢，美國處處在遷就日本，有時甚至不惜稍稍犧牲中國，這是很可怕的。日本如果成為「東亞的警犬」，絕非中國之福，亦非世界之福。</p>
<p>中國人若尙有點自知之明的話，對於日本行將組派「謝罪團」的答覆，我想應該是請他們多在建立愛好和平的日本民主政府方面用點功夫，這比「謝罪團」之類有意義多了。</p>

<h3>鄉村五月</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>上星期日，因事返常州鄉間，下火車站，聽說汽車開行時間不定，即　牛頭車（獨鑰小車）下鄕，車夫討價以米計算，二十里路約一斗米。作三萬元，供膳一餐。</p>
<p>沿途所見，元麥，大麥均已　完，小麥亦在待割，嫩綠黃豆長約五寸，農夫農　司在田間除草，七八歲及十　　兒　　牛墳夥，　　人間，與上海　　孜孜為利生活，判若雲泥。</p>
<p>鄕問無學潮，搶米潮，一切均寂靜無聲。有的是忙工（，工作一日或數日）無法盧及齡壯丁如何避免兵役。</p>
<p>「鄕村五月閒人少」，在太平時代，到五月農忙的時候，就患着勞力不足的病症。</p>
<p>因為勞力不足，婦女開始參加田間工作，與上海近郊鄕村，因男子到上海作工，由女子耕田的情形相彷彿。忙工每日工資米五吉，作二萬元，供其膳食。麥價每石在二十萬元以內，增添了農人的　容。</p>
<p>「　賤喪農」，今日晨民感覺到的，就是在新　或新豰登場的時候，麥價或穀價總是特別使宜，可是一到青黃不接，麥價　價貴的時候，他們早已空如縣聲，有的不得不借貸度日。</p>
<p>鄕村小學放忙飯，敎師及　生回家帮同操作，此種假期，　比普通暑假來得有意義。</p>
<p>「鄕村五月」，是農業生產者的總動員期，可惜農業技術落在人後，不能配合工業，改善農民生活，當今之世更談不上。</p>
<h3>法治—史雜記之八—</h3>
<p>— 蕭黛</p>
<p>在中國民族初步形成的游牧時代，先民正忙着與自然鬥；及至稍現安定的農耕時代，各自「掘井而飲，耕田而食」，與別的部族既少接觸，而未發生經濟上的關係，且當時社會次序亦未樹立，自不會有人想到所謂法治。歷史慢慢地演進，因為諸部族的相互征伐，就田政治而進入了經濟的關係，跟着經濟的逐漸發展，生活條件也就優越起來。因之，奢侈的生活腐化了一般貴族階級，動搖了霸者的統治。</p>
<p>管仲相齊的時候，看到齊國的經濟情形較其他各國為進步，都市生活亦頗發達，因此，國貴族，很多腐化；即以齊桓公而論，就有三個夫人和六個如夫人。管仲欲挽救此一頹風，以樹模範，於是向齊桓公主張採用法治。他的主張在管子明　里說得很明白：</p>
<p>明主者，一度量之儀表而堅守之，故令下而民從。法者天下之程式也，凡事之儀表也。……明主者有法度之制，故羣臣皆出於方正之治而不敢為奸。百姓知主之從事於法也，故吏所使者有法，則民從之，無法則止。民以法與相距，下以法與上從事。故詐偽之人不得欺其主，嫉妒之人不得用其賊心，纔諛之人不得施其巧，千里之外不敢擅為非。故明法曰：有法度者，不可以巧詐偽。」</p>
<p>又管子任法篇說：</p>
<p>「法者，天下之至道也，聖君之實用也。……有生法。有守法；夫生法者君也，守法者臣也，法於法者民也。君臣上下貴賤皆從法，此謂之大治。」</p>
<p>管仲的倡行法漢，所收的效果如何，筆者未找得可靠之記載，不敢妄加猜測，然從衛鞅治秦倡行法治，以及漢之酌减刑法等等觀之，也自有它的好處在。</p>
<p>但毛病也就跟着來了，賈誼對秦法的批評說：「置天下於法令刑法，德澤無一有，而怨毒盈於世，下憎惡之如仇難。」</p>
<p>從這里我們可以看到，受苦的是「法於法者」的「民」；而所謂「守法」的「臣」，非但未「守法」亦未受苦，反在那里玩法，自然更不必談起「生法」的君了。</p>
<h3>生活費用</h3>

<p>乙：有的。拿你收入，不管它是多少，再加上百分之一百，就可以得到了。</p>
<h3>救難濟貧</h3>
<p>— 陳德馨</p>
<p>幼時老師授格言一首云：「人生第一好事，　如救難濟貧。殘　剩飯，亦可救人之　；敝衣敗絮，亦可濟人之　。酒筵省得一二味，饒贈省得一二品，衣服少置一二套，房　少建一二間，傢具少辦一二件；存些贏餘，濟人急難。去無用，可成大用；積小惠，可成大德。」鄙意此數事一般人皆能為之。積財莫如積　，何不奮起力行？</p>
<h3>中國不能造汽車</h3>
<p>— 增輝</p>
<p>本月四日，報載參議會討論繳收汽車市政建設捐時，有下面一段辯論</p>
<p>「周祥生謂「在外國營業車均不收捐。」瞿鉞反駁稱：「外國能自造汽車，中國不能自己造汽車」（引起哄堂大笑）。」</p>
<p>看了這二句話，不禁使人啼笑皆非，所以引起哄堂大笑者，乃因瞿參議員詞鋒銳利，正對着周參議員的話而發，其實瞿參議員的話，一語道被了中國的弱點，而含有深切意義的。</p>
<p>假如中國眞能造汽車，不必說不用徽收汽車建設捐，就是其他的苛捐雜稅，一定可以减少許多，中國的經濟危機不會嚴重到如此地步。</p>
<p>吾國並非沒有人才會造汽車，這是整個的工業與經濟間題，造汽車須先有優良的原料，從開礦，到冶鍊鋼鐵，建設大規模製造廠，聘請科學家研究改進，現在需要鉅大的資金。而現在貧窮的中國，這些從何談起？何怪乎多收幾種捐稅！</p>
<p>據聞日本賠償吾國的物資中，將有大量的鎭鐵廠，機械廠等重工業設備，希望我們能好好的利用一下，否則，再隔數十年，中國仍舊是不能造汽車的。</p>

<h3>訪梅蘭芳（四）</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>然而當時使我感動最深的，不是這種細事，却是人生無常之　。他的年紀比我大，今年五十六了。無論他身體如何好，今後還有幾年能唱戲呢？上帝手造這件精妙無比的傑作十餘年後必須坍損失效；而這坍損是絕對無法修繕的！政治家可以奠定萬世之基，使自己雖死猶生；文藝家可以把作品傳之後世，使人生短而藝術長。因為他們的法寳不是全在於肉體上的。現在坐在我眼前的這件特殊的傑作，其法寳全在這六尺之軀；而這軀壳比這茶杯還脆弱。比這沙發還不耐用，比這香烟罐頭（他請我吸的是三五牌）還不經久！對比之下，使我何等地感慨，何等地惋惜？於是我熱忱地勸請他，今後多灌留聲片，多拍有聲有色的電影·唱片與電影雖然也是必朽之物，但比起這短短的十餘年來，永久得多，亦可聯以慰情了。但據他說，似有種種阻難，亦未能暢所欲為。引導我去訪的，是攝影家郎靜山先生，和身帶鏡頭的陳驚瞶盛學明兩君。兩君就在梅氏的院子裏替我們留了許多影。攝影畢，我吿辭。他和我握手很久。手相家說：「男手貴軟，女手貴硬」。他的手的軟，使我吃驚。</p>
<p>與郎先生等分手之後，我獨自在歸途中想：依宗敎的無始無終的大人格看來，藝術本來是曇花泡影，電光石火；靈時幻減，又何足珍惜！獨怪造物者太無算計；旣然造得這樣精巧，應該延長其保甩年限；保用年限旣然死不肯延長，則犯不着造得這樣精巧；大可馬馬虎虎草　了事，也可使人　减省許多癡</p>
<p>唉！惡作劇的造物主　！忽　　　　　　　沙法量下，　罩了上海市的萬千衆生。我隱約聽得濤物主之聲：「你們保用年限又短一天！」（究）卅六年六月二日於杭州作。</p>

<h3>British Advisor Goes to Hong Kong to Discuss Preventing Smuggling</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, Eighth Day] The Chinese government is increasingly troubled by large-scale commodity smuggling in South China and is pressing the Hong Kong government to take measures to suppress it. Rogers, a British advisor to the Executive Yuan and the Central Government, has come to Hong Kong for the third time, accompanied by Chinese officials, to discuss this matter with the Hong Kong government. According to well-informed official sources, there is currently little hope of taking any action. They believe that the cause of large-scale smuggling should be attributed to China's strict import and export regulations. Another problem troubling the Chinese government is the flight of foreign funds to Hong Kong. Officials here also blame China for this, saying that the exchange rates set by the Chinese national banks encourage the transfer of foreign remittances to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Police Bureaus of Provinces and Cities Allowed to Restore Original Structure</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth Day] After the victory of the War of Resistance, due to demobilization, the Central Government once changed the affiliation of the police bureaus of various provincial capitals and directly administered police bureaus, which had an impact on the future of police construction.

(2) Those that were originally provincial capital police bureaus or directly administered police bureaus, etc., and have already been changed to the jurisdiction, may temporarily maintain the status quo.

Heaven did not spare them, leaving us without consultation. Their achievements are inscribed on bronze tripods and vessels, their portraits painted in vermilion and blue. Incense is respectfully offered, may they come and receive it, may they respond to our thoughts."</p>
<p>(2) The Public Memorial Text of the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to the late Member Bai Wenwei: "On the eighth day of June in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Zhongzheng, President of the Chinese Kuomintang, and all members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, with clear wine and offerings of silk, pay tribute to the spirit of Comrade Bai Liewu, saying: Alas, hearing the drums reminds us of generals, listening to the wind and rain reminds us of old friends. At this time, when bandits fill the mountains and foreign troubles lurk, when the wind and rain are dark and the cicadas buzz noisily, we cannot but lament the passing of this experienced man. Tracing back to the revolution in the late Qing Dynasty, he served as a brilliant party member, inspired by the late Father of the Nation, revering him as a deity, abandoning his pen to join the military, aspiring to wait for the opportunity, and you were one of the most prominent among them. First forming an alliance in Jiangnan, then seeking refuge in the Northeast, and with your face to the island of Japan, your name became famous, and the world mostly did not know that Dun Chu and you were, in fact, his right and left hands. But fortune has its ups and downs, and times have their failures and successes. Continued achievements were not evident, Dun Chu having retreated to Japan, and you also hiding your tracks in the rivers, old comrades could not but sigh for you, but your spirit grew stronger, and your will became more firm. On New Year's Eve of the Gengxu year, you sold your fur coat and arranged a banquet, inviting all your friends and drinking until you made a decree, how magnificent it was. The following year, when the banner of righteousness was first raised, comrades in the Northeast contributed funds to support your journey, waving your hand to Qin Ning, laughing and riding in the carriage, with tears and laughter together, how heroic it was. Within a month, you had summoned all the strong men of the Huai and Si Rivers, and an army was formed day and night. The red flag of Jiangpu rose suddenly and prominently, and when you settled in Datong and entered Anqing, as the Governor-General of Military Affairs, opening a mansion in Anhui, how glorious it was. In the year of Guichou, the army was defeated, but your ambition was not diminished. In the intervening years, during the wars against Yuan and the protection of the Constitution, you traveled between Yunnan, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Hubei, in the tents and on the battlefields, great achievements were gathered, you can be called a good soldier. In the year of Bingyin, during the Northern Expedition and the establishment of the capital, you released your troops with a smile, content and at ease, which is enough to be a model for revolutionary soldiers. Twenty years of crusading against the fate of the military, twenty years of assisting the central authorities, hoping to determine fate and jointly face national disasters, although living in the capital, you still had the spirit of the mountains and forests, with a beginning and an end, without boasting or arrogance, alas, you were truly a complete man. At this time, when human desires are rampant and inexperienced youth are everywhere, the dens of jackals and wolves are right in the place where you used to advance, if you had knowledge, you would be overwhelmed with emotion! Alas, pacifying chaos and building the nation, we are relying on experienced men, why did Heaven not spare you, and took you away with your ambition? The pain is hidden in the yellow earth, as distant as mountains and rivers. A cup of clear wine is offered with respect and sincerity, may you examine and come. Alas, may you respond to our thoughts."</p>
<p>(3) The Public Memorial Text of the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to the late Member of the National Government, Liu Shangqing: "On the eighth day of June in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Zhongzheng, President of the Chinese Kuomintang, and all members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, with clear wine and offerings of grain, pay tribute to the spirit of the late Member of the National Government and Vice President of the Control Yuan, Comrade Liu Haiquan, saying: Looking west to the foot of the Bai Mountains, the Silver Ridge stands tall, the winding streams of the Chang and Liao Rivers flow nearby, responding to the essence of the mountains and rivers, a loyal and virtuous person is born, in youth, he developed literary talent and passed the county examination, then studied jurisprudence and managed the salt tax, economic development brought prosperity to the people, he met the loyal and steadfast commander, a hero in one area, a brilliant man who recognized the times and returned to the central government, to unify the great cause without hesitation, to manage the interior and govern the vast territory, to regulate the Lantai and be strict as the autumn frost, all these achievements, how can we record them all? Suddenly he became ill and traveled to a foreign land, medical treatment in Qin was difficult to cure the blindness, soul, return to us from the distant wilderness, looking to Dongyang there are many cicadas, the bear devours people and spreads rampant, when will the traveler return to his homeland? People lament and together with the emperor feel sorrow, members awaken and tears flow, spirit if you know, come and taste."</p>
<p>(4) The Public Memorial Text of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to Member Tan Zhen: "On the eighth day of June in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Zhongzheng, President of the Chinese Kuomintang, and all members of the Central Executive Committee, with offerings of flowers and paper money, pay tribute to the spirit of the late Member of the Central Supervisory Committee and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Comrade Tan Liming, saying: You, comrade, a hero of Taoyuan, followed the Father of the Nation early on and made your name in the register, diligently studying jurisprudence, with a spirit that swallowed the Hu and Mian Rivers, the spirits of the Yangtze and Han Rivers shone, the waves of Dongting Lake surged, no battle was missed, returning to wield your weapons, although Chu had only three households, it would surely destroy Qin, the Han banners rose in four directions, and the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, the Republic was established, and together you planned for peace and security, you first received the mandate of the people and gave your opinions from the rostrum, embracing the principles and cutting off heterodoxy, having endured many hardships, you greatly helped the difficult times, assisting in the management of the judiciary, assisting the five powers, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, you returned together in victory, for forty years, the Party and the country relied on you, hoping that you would open up and assist, and that your plans would always be with us, but Heaven was unkind, and took away this virtuous man, the air darkened in Heng Mountain, and tears choked in the Yuan and Xiang Rivers, with sincerity and respect, we offer this incense, may your spirit come and accept it, and may it respond to our thoughts."</p>

<h3>Middle and Lower Level Members of the Democratic League in Various Places Submit Inquiries to the Headquarters; Written Answers Have Been Provided by Luo Longji and Others</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Eighth Day] It is learned that middle and lower-level members of the Democratic League in various places, feeling that the Democratic League itself is facing a crisis on all sides, have shaken their confidence in the organization and have submitted inquiries, writing to the League's headquarters to request clear answers: (1) How many democratic political groups have joined the Democratic League? (2) Who are the main figures of each political group? (3) Did Deng Chumin go to Hong Kong to plan for the relocation of the headquarters to Hong Kong? (4) Why did Hu Mingna write to the headquarters requesting to withdraw from the League? (5) What is the situation of the League's income and expenses? (6) Will the Democratic League parliamentarians participate in the Fourth Session of the Third Plenary of the Political Council? (7) Xu Deheng and others plan to contact the Democratic League to launch a peace movement. Does the Democratic League agree? (8) Why does the Democratic League adopt a secret system? (9) What is the future of the Democratic League? After receiving the above questions, the leaders of the Democratic League held several meetings to study and decided that Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun would jointly be responsible for providing written answers. The main points of the answers are extracted as follows: (1) The original participants in the Democratic League were three parties (namely the Youth Party, the Workers and Peasants Democratic Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party) and three factions (namely the National Salvation Association faction, the Vocational Education faction, and the Rural Construction faction). Since the Qingmin and Liang parties withdrew, the China Democratic Constitutional Government Promotion Association and the China Democratic National Construction Association were invited to join. (2) The main figures of each political group: Zhang Bojun and Qiu Zhe of the Workers and Peasants Democratic Party, Cai Tingkai and Chen Jiageng of the China Democratic Constitutional Government Promotion Association, Zhang Naiqi and Li Zhuchen of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Shen Junru, Shi Liang, Zhang Shenfu, Liu Wang Limin, and others of the National Salvation Association faction, Fei Yanpei and Jiang Hengyuan of the Vocational Education faction, and Liang Shuming of the Rural Construction faction. Other factions and individual figures include Zhang Lan, Du Qiancheng, Deng Chumin, Zhou Xinmin, Guo Moruo, Li Xiangfu, and Wu Han, among others. (3) The headquarters will not be relocated for the time being. Deng went to Hong Kong to represent the Democratic League at the Hong Kong celebration of the "May Fourth" Literary and Art Festival and the Youth Festival, and to contact the Democratic League's relations in Hong Kong. (4) Hu Mingna is the general manager of Hecheng Bank. The problem arose because Zhang Lan was involved in Hecheng Bank loans. This time, the Democratic League raised funds, and Zhang asked Hu to donate 10 million yuan, but Hu refused and requested to withdraw from the League. Shen Junru, Luo Longjin, and Zhang Bojun are mediating. (5) The headquarters has financial difficulties and has no choice but to solicit donations from members. Regarding income and expenses, you can check the accounts of each branch. (6) It is feared that it will be difficult to participate in this session of the Political Council without the consent of friendly parties (referring to the Communist Party). (7) The Democratic League does not take the initiative in the peace movement. (8) The headquarters sometimes has to keep the organization and personnel secret. (9) If the CCP can support itself militarily until the second half of the year, the international situation will change, and the Democratic League can then rise to prominence. The reason why the Democratic League does not participate in the government is to wait for this day.</p>

<h3>Although the CCP Refuses to Participate in the Conference and Calls for Peace, the Government's Plan Remains Unchanged and Drafting Peace Proposals Will Continue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] The Communist Party's official newspaper, the Liberation Daily editorial, categorically rejected the Political Consultative Conference's call for peace, disheartening members' enthusiasm for the peace movement. Persons close to the government said: This embodies the Communist Party's tendency to seize power, as indirectly announced by Mao Zedong after the cessation of peace talks last year. They pointed out that it is now clear that, unless a miracle occurs, peace talks in China cannot be restored, because the CCP's ultimate goal is one-party autocracy, rather than multiple parties participating in the government together, which is the same as the Soviet political forms in various parts of the world. Observers also said: It is expected that the Communist Party's attitude will not affect the government's new peacebuilding plan proposed for discussion in the next State Council meeting. This will be the government's final peaceful action against the Communist Party to resolve the internal conflict by political means. The government's immediate reaction to this is to continue drafting peace proposals. According to Interior Minister Peng Lisheng: The government will not modify its plan as a result of the Communist Party's broadcast.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun's Radio Speech in the United States: I Hope the United States Will Provide Financial Assistance to Promote Economic Recovery and Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said in a broadcast tonight that some countries "seem to be implementing ominous expansion and control policies," which prolong the current uncertain situation, prevent the early completion of recovery and reconstruction, and make it impossible to restore world security, peace, and prosperity. Mr. Gu was participating in a weekly broadcast program by the National Broadcasting Company of the United States, together with the Indian Ambassador to the United States, to discuss "Asia's Responsibility in World Affairs." He said: China is eager to obtain financial assistance from the United States to promote economic recovery and increase agricultural and industrial production. China has no intention of using foreign aid for political purposes, such as balancing the budget. China's eagerness to accelerate its economic development is also because China occupies a most strategic front line in the global defense line for world peace. The United States has enormous economic power and should fulfill its responsibility to help freedom-loving nations restore and improve their economic environment. Mr. Gu also said: In world problems, the economic and political aspects are very closely related.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Dr. Gu Weijun said in his speech today: "The Chinese people have a deep faith in the motives of the United Nations organization. China believes that the United Nations is still in its long development period from infancy to adulthood. Before the United Nations can effectively guarantee world security and peace, it must improve its institutions and establish the necessary tools. Therefore, the Security Council should formulate satisfactory solutions to the issues of controlling atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction, organizing international police, and establishing military bases. The Security Council must reach an agreement on the issue of universal disarmament, especially on effective supervision and control."</p>
<h3>Authorities Begin to Stabilize the Economy, Military Spending Will Be Reduced as Much as Possible, and the Principles of Property Tax Collection Are Largely Determined</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Self-sufficiency will be the supreme guiding principle of our future fiscal policy. On the central government side, military expenditures will be reduced as much as possible, various administrative expenses will be reduced as much as possible, no new institutions will be added, and new projects that are unprofitable will not be undertaken. Furthermore, the current subsidies for various state-owned enterprises account for a considerable proportion of the total national expenditure. This kind of measure, in which "all the people bear the burden to reduce the burden of a part of the people," is not reasonable. In the future, this will be gradually reduced. Except for some poor provinces, the central government will no longer subsidize local finances in the future, so as to ensure that local finances can achieve self-sufficiency. What will complement cost savings will be revenue generation. This process will be slightly more proactive. After the work of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure is completed, the management and stabilization of the entire economy can be formally and concretely started.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The authorities believe that military expenditures are important to the balance of the budget, and the Minister of National Defense is not a member of the National Economic Commission, so there are many gaps in discussions. Therefore, it is planned to amend the Organic Law of the National Economic Commission and make the Minister of National Defense a member of the Commission.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The principles for levying a one-time property tax have been largely determined: (1) Property evaluation work will be assisted by local public opinion organs; (2) The collection agency will entrust local administrative organs to collect taxes on its behalf; (3) The tax objects will be both objects and people; (4) The tax rate will be progressive for the amount of property exceeding a certain limit; (5) The scope of property includes land and houses, as well as deposits and assets of Chinese people abroad.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Regarding the handling of foreign deposits and assets, diplomatic negotiations have not stopped. The past difficulty was that foreign banks refused to disclose the list of account names. The authorities are now trying to levy property taxes on such deposits and assets. This matter is different from expropriation in nature, and the negotiations are expected to succeed.</p>

<h3>Allied Powers' Treaty Terms with Japan: The US Government Will Make Proposals; The Date of the Peace Conference Has Not Yet Been Decided</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] According to well-informed officials: The US government's proposals on the terms of the Japanese peace treaty have been largely completed, and when Secretary of State Marshall believes the time is ripe, it will begin consultations with relevant countries. According to them: the United States will undoubtedly submit various difficult issues, such as the date of the peace conference, the procedures of the peace conference, and the outline of the draft treaty, to the major countries of the East this summer, but the exact date has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>US officials anticipate that there will be no difficulties in resolving the territorial issues in the treaty. They believe that most countries will agree to the Soviet Union's rule of the Kuril Islands and South Sakhalin, as stipulated in the Yalta Agreement, and that the post-war borders of Japan should be restricted to within its native soil, as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. It is also believed that the United States' rule of Okinawa and other former Japanese islands, which the United States considers necessary for its Pacific defense line, will not cause serious disputes among the countries. However, regarding the economic issues of Japan, and regarding the issues of economic and political regulation of Japan, it is expected that various major differences will occur between the major countries. For example, it is expected that China and the Soviet Union will want Japan's economy to remain lower than the level that the UK and the US want it to maintain. Regarding the issue of long-term regulation of Japan, it is believed that China, the Soviet Union, and Australia may have very different opinions from the UK and the US regarding the form, degree, and period of regulation. However, officials in the United States believe that all issues are easier to resolve than European treaties, because there are no vastly divergent opinions regarding the territorial issues in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Restore Foreign Trade and Plans to Set a Foreign Exchange Rate Before the Treaty is Signed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese business people privately hope that Japan can follow the example of Italy and use a temporary exchange rate as a foundation to restore foreign trade before the treaty is signed. Regarding this matter, we can also mention the hopes of Japanese officials, that is, they hope that the treaty with Japan can be concluded in the manner of the treaty with Italy. Recently, the local English newspaper "Japan Times" published the full text of the treaty with Italy, with the title "Trying to Adopt." Japanese traders and industrialists are all looking forward to the restoration of foreign trade with great enthusiasm. When the US trade delegation visited, a large-scale raw silk exhibition was held in Tokyo last month. Shortly thereafter, the Foreign Trade Development Association, the Foreign Trade Association, the Foreign Trade Development Committee, and the Trade Association jointly organized a trade association to study the prospects for foreign trade after the war and to make some plans for the future. Last week, the Japanese government established a committee to study international trade regulations. Officials and business people are busy with various activities, hoping to reopen foreign trade. However, according to a reporter who learned from officials of the Japan Trade Bureau that they are cautious about the future of Japan's foreign trade and emphasized that the principle of controlled trade will not change until the treaty has not been signed. At the same time, the Association of Commerce and Industry conducted a survey of various trading companies, and the results showed that most of them are eager to first restore trade with the United States and China, and then with various parts of Southeast Asia. Japan is willing to export textiles, tea, cosmetics, and medical equipment, and hopes to import machinery, cane sugar, wood lacquer, fats, oils, and machine tools. The Association of Commerce and Industry is preparing to build the Tokyo Foreign Trade Building to exhibit Japanese products.</p>

<h3>Dredging Yunzaobang and Suzhou River: Shanghai Municipal Government Proposal Passed</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The National Water Conservancy Conference passed the proposal of the Shanghai Municipal Government to dredge the Yunzaobang and Suzhou River, and to build a connecting waterway between the two rivers, so that inland cargo ships can directly exit Wusongkou and connect with sea transportation. The contents of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Reason: The Huangpu River, Yunzaobang, and Suzhou River (Wusong River) are collectively known as the first-class main rivers of this city. The deep-water coastline along the Pujiang estuary of Yunzaobang is an excellent pier location for foreign ships and a joint transportation station at the end of the Jinghu Line. The upper reaches of the Yunzaobang, from the north of Dachang District, enter Jiading County via the border of Baoshan and can connect with Taicang and Changshu water areas. The Suzhou River enters Jiading and Kunshan via Zhenru District and can connect with Wuxian County. In the past, the number of ships on the two rivers was comparable and freight transportation was smooth. In recent decades, siltation has become increasingly serious, and the riverbed is narrow and unbearable. Only during high tides can navigation barely be maintained, which has greatly affected the supply of rice and grain in the Shanghai area. Furthermore, various types of ships gather on the river surface of the Suzhou River below Caojiadu, and water transportation is almost impossible to maintain. It is urgent to find ways to disperse them. If the upstream can follow the tributary into Yunzaobang and directly connect to sea transportation, the congestion of the midstream and upper reaches of the Huangpu River can also be improved. For the above-mentioned two rivers, it is most appropriate to use the old river course from the Muguanggang Port of Suzhou River, via Yangshunanxiyi, to connect with Yunzaobang. It is most appropriate to widen and deepen it.</p>
<p>Method: For the above-mentioned projects within the jurisdiction of this city, the Suzhou River is 26 kilometers long, the Yunzaobang is 15.5 kilometers long, and the connecting tributary is 16.6 kilometers long. If a water depth of 2 meters is maintained at low water level, the required engineering funds will reach approximately 8.1 billion yuan based on current prices. It is proposed to subsidize 4 billion yuan from the central water conservancy funds so that it can be held immediately, and it is hoped that the water conservancy authorities of the province of Jiangsu province will dredge outside the territory of this city at the same time to facilitate navigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Daily and Evening Newspapers Cease Publication: Mediation Yesterday Did Not Yield Results</h3>
<p>Various Agencies and Organizations Will Arbitrate</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 8th] The five major daily newspapers in this county have been suspended for three days, forming a city without newspapers or printing. The headquarters, county government, council, county chamber of commerce, general labor union, and other agencies and organizations made the greatest efforts to mediate from 8:00 AM on the 8th to seek a rational solution to this serious problem. The results of the discussions are still not close. It is said that a public arbitration method will be used tomorrow. The Daily Newspaper Association is sincerely afraid that it will affect the newspaper associations in the counties along the Jinghu Line, so it telegraphed the Provincial Social Affairs Office, asking Director Niu to come to Wuxi to preside over the mediation. One of the evening newspapers decided to cease publication on the 9th, and the situation is very pessimistic.</p>

<h3>Philippine Consul in Amoy Guilty of Corruption; Illegally Extorting from Overseas Chinese; Philippine Foreign Ministry Recalls for Investigation</h3>

It is reported that the Philippine Foreign Ministry has received reliable reports from Amoy stating that Nili, through his staff, has been extorting personal fees of 75 to 150 yuan from any Chinese person seeking his assistance. According to people newly arrived from the mainland, who told the Central News Agency reporter, every immigrant coming to the Philippines must pay at least 750 yuan to all "relevant parties" in the name of "handling fees."

These hotels sell expired or forged entry permits, with entrants paying 500,000 yuan in national currency to obtain a forged permit and a ship ticket. The Immigration Bureau also stated that entry permits are only issued by the Singapore Authority, and relatives of those wishing to come to Singapore should warn their relatives not to obtain them from other organizations or hotels.

<h3>President of the Viet Minh Republic Ho Chi Minh Issues Statement; Hopes for Moral Assistance from All Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, July 7th Dispatch] In a letter answering written questions from a reporter, the President of the Viet Minh Republic stated that if the French government could issue a clear new declaration regarding the Viet Minh, such as that issued by the British government for India and Burma, it would greatly facilitate the resumption of French-Viet Minh negotiations. Ho also said that the Viet Minh issue is not a French domestic issue, so the Viet Minh will submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly when necessary. In referring to the attitude of various powers, Ho said that China views the Viet Minh as brothers, the United States has a friendly attitude, and Britain is either conservative or neutral. Ho then stated that recognizing the unity and independence of the Viet Minh is the minimum requirement for negotiations. Unity refers to the organization of a purely unified government by uniting Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin, with each of the three states establishing an autonomous government directly controlled by and responsible to the central government. Independence means that the Viet Minh people have the right to manage their affairs without external assistance. The Viet Minh government cannot allow only the merger of Tonkin and Annam, while Cochinchina awaits a popular vote to decide. Ho also said that the French side has said that establishing a solution with Ho Chi Minh will allow the Soviet Union to gain a foothold in Vietnam, but this is purely an excuse, as the Soviet Union did not even exist in 1916, while France has ruled the Viet Minh for eighty years. Ho Chi Minh personally may be a fascist or a follower of Confucius, but the Viet Minh government has representatives from various parties as well as non-partisans. Ho then criticized the French claim that the current turmoil was initiated by him, saying that the Viet Minh government desires peace and has therefore abolished the Supreme Resistance Committee and launched a three-year recovery plan, but the Viet Minh people will continue to struggle until unity and freedom are achieved. Ho finally issued a declaration to the people of the world, stating that the world's democrats must unite to protect the democracy of all countries, large and small, so that the rights guaranteed by the Atlantic Charter and the Charter of the United Nations can be enjoyed by all nations. Asian brothers, I hope that you will fully support the independent struggle of our Viet Minh compatriots. The Vietnamese people depend on the moral and material support that you can provide.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Truman Doctrine and the Far East</h3>
<p>President Truman delivered a speech in Kansas City yesterday afternoon, reiterating that the United States has the firm determination to lead the people of all countries in the world towards a path of lasting peace. He stated that the United States should remain strong, develop its natural resources, improve agriculture, and increase production, so that the United States can provide the greatest assistance to countries in need. He also clarified the so-called Truman Doctrine, saying that the responsibility of the United States is to lead the people of all countries in the world in a way that provides assistance to the people of all countries who are experiencing misfortune and seeking freedom and independence, and to create world peace. The United States Army, Navy, and Air Force must remain strong, but since the surrender of Germany and Japan, the United States military has gradually demobilized and dispersed, which is tantamount to encouraging countries that see the weakness of peace-loving countries as an invitation to aggression. He concluded by saying that the people of all countries in the world should accept the principle that "there is no peace without sincerity," and that the United States should remain strong and have faith in fulfilling its responsibilities, which is the obligation of the United States.</p>
<p>After listening to President Truman's speech, we were reminded of the Washington dispatch from the United Press International two days ago, which stated in essence that "President Truman may reaffirm the United States' policy towards China in the coming weeks, because Chairman Chiang's work to expand the foundation of the government has made some achievements, so the obstacles to the US Export-Import Bank's 500 million loan have been completely cleared away, and Secretary of State Marshall is also strongly advocating for this, as he firmly believes that it is wise for the United States to assist the Chinese National Government as soon as possible." Although this dispatch is merely the speculation of UPI reporter Hansley, there are various signs that President Truman will indeed reiterate the necessity of the United States' policy towards China.</p>
<p>From a distance, the European political situation is deteriorating day by day. The coup in Hungary was created by the Soviet Union. Not only did the Hungarian cabinet change, but it also involved many foreign envoys. This is clearly part of the Soviet Union's political plan for the Balkan Peninsula. The second is Bulgaria. The arrest of opposition leader Petkov has created an atmosphere of fear in the Bulgarian capital, and opposition newspapers are being suppressed by the government, and there is the possibility of a political upheaval at any time. The same situation exists in Romania, where the Soviet Union is taking a high-pressure policy in Romania and may stage a coup similar to that in Hungary. The United States cannot turn a blind eye to the Soviet Union's interference in other countries' internal affairs. Needless to say, the United States is about to protest to the Soviet Union about the Hungarian coup and demand an investigation into the truth of the Hungarian coup. From this, we can see that US-Soviet relations have evolved to the stage of close combat.</p>
<p>Secondly, looking at the United States, there are three major events in the United States recently in terms of domestic and foreign affairs that are most worthy of our attention: (1) Secretary of State Marshall requested Congress to continue to aid European countries affected by war, not only aid to Greece and Turkey; President Truman stated to the press on the 5th that he would not abandon the plan to aid foreign countries. (2) The United States Senate had extremely divergent opinions on the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, but all amendments were rejected by the Senate, and finally they were approved by a majority of seventy-nine votes to ten; once these five peace treaties are ratified by France and the Soviet Union, they can formally take effect, and it can be seen here that the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States can still work together and adopt a bipartisan foreign policy. (3) The State Department requested the Senate and House of Representatives on the 6th to extend one of the President's wartime powers, namely the government's power to control export trade, for one year, so as to supply some urgently needed countries with goods that are still scarce in the United States.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that recent US domestic and foreign policy is all implementing the Truman Doctrine. In theory, the United States is actively stepping up aid to China, which was originally not a problem. The US Export-Import Bank's 500 million loan could have been loaned to China long ago and used for the great cause of national reconstruction; but why has it not been realized to this day? This is very obvious, that is, the scope of implementation of the Truman Doctrine is limited to Europe, and China is still outside its scope of implementation. As the editorial in the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" stated two days ago: "Up to now, the US policy with the Truman Doctrine as its backbone has not included China in its scope of implementation. US policy towards China has been at a standstill since Marshal Marshall left China and returned home." At the same time, according to the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Gold, who returned to Shanghai from the United States, said: "The United States' view of China has not fundamentally changed. Although the United States itself has many difficult problems, it still expresses great sympathy for the disasters that China has encountered; but the recent trend is that emotional sensitivity is not as acute as before. The general public believes that both the friends of the country and China itself have made some mistakes after the war, and these accumulated mistakes need to be reflected upon. What we should do in the future is to pay attention to realism, in other words, to provide assistance only where it is effective."</p>
<p>However, the Truman Doctrine is essentially global, and its scope of implementation should not be limited to one corner of Europe, otherwise the Truman Doctrine will lose its unity. Moreover, the situation in China today is no different from that stated by President Truman regarding other countries. First, China has suffered from eight years of war, and its people have long been impoverished and its wealth exhausted, and its vitality has been greatly damaged, urgently in need of foreign aid and relief; second, the Chinese people all seek peace, democracy, and freedom, and sincerely hope to build a free and independent country by adopting innovation and reconstruction methods; third, China's biggest crisis at present is the threat of communism, so China needs US aid most urgently, even more than Greece and Turkey; fourth, under the current international environment, international relations are becoming increasingly close, and the world has long been indivisible. If the Truman Doctrine is truly based on peace and justice, then the United States' policy towards China cannot abandon the Truman Doctrine and follow others.</p>
<p>In short, it is time for the Truman Doctrine to be implemented in the Far East! The inconsistency of US opinions towards China has created the current static state. For the sake of lasting peace in the Far East, and also for the sake of the United States' own interests, the United States cannot allow this situation to continue for a long time, so the UPI reporter's statement that President Truman will reaffirm his policy towards China in the coming weeks is not only possible but also necessary! Let us wait here quietly for President Truman to make an important statement!</p>
<p>Deficiencies of the Draft Property Tax Law</p>
<p>At the previous direct tax conference, someone proposed levying property tax, and we immediately pointed out: (1) It is technically too difficult, (2) The result may still be that real estate is the main target. It is now heard that this plan has been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and will be submitted to the National Economic Commission for discussion on the 10th. The six standards proposed by the Ministry of Finance have (1) and (2) that are entirely real estate, (4), (5) and (6) that are partly real estate, and only (3) foreign exchange that is purely movable property. This is largely consistent with our predictions.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple. In our country today, accurate statistics on households and land are still lacking. Personal property has always been a taboo subject, kept secret and unsuitable for discussion. The government has not conducted any form of investigation. Although there are tax registers for real estate items such as house rent and land tax, most of the registered names are not the real names, and local methods are not necessarily consistent. After the war, even this incomplete register was mostly lost and incomplete. If the situation of real estate is like this, what about other movable property? It is often heard that the authorities originally had a plan to conduct a general investigation first, which, although slow, was a very proper method. However, this time, the plan was hastily completed, avoiding the above-mentioned procedures. It was naturally necessary to cope with the current situation, but mistakes and omissions, uneven burdens, and other phenomena are feared to be unavoidable in fact. Looking ahead, we cannot help but feel worried.</p>
<p>Since the proposal to levy property tax was announced, there have indeed been many people in society who have expressed their support. The Senate recently also passed a resolution on this matter, as reported in the newspapers. In principle, we do not want to express any dissenting opinions again; however, upon careful examination of the arguments supporting this proposal, the focus is mostly on the point of "those with money should pay money," which is to say that the wealthy class should fulfill more of their tax obligations. Their argument is not unfair. The six standards set by the Ministry of Finance all have a starting point for levying the tax, and those who do not meet the starting point can of course be exempted from the tax. Their views can also be said to be the same. The problem is that movable property is hidden and difficult to investigate; all of the truly wealthy have long had a place to settle their cash and valuables, whether it is in the Americas or nearby Hong Kong. Moreover, it seems that the authorities have also stated that the (3) foreign exchange item is difficult to handle diplomatically and is practically a dead letter. In that case, the wealthy property that can be collected will undoubtedly fall below the second and third tiers. Judging from the original purpose, even if it is not greatly different, it will still be greatly discounted.</p>
<p>The starting point for the land tax item is set at more than 50 mu, and the scope of their vision is inevitably limited to one corner. Because the north is more sparsely populated and land is usually calculated in terms of hectares or squares. If the plan is implemented as it is, it will be equivalent to a general collection, which is somewhat different from the original intention of the plan. Also, the value of the house is set at more than 30 million yuan. In terms of numbers, it seems to be considerable, but in terms of current prices, houses below 30 million yuan seem to be in the minority in the city. Moreover, the housing shortage is extremely serious now, and rents have become unbalanced. Taking Shanghai as an example, the generally well-meaning landlords are running out of options, and this new tax still focuses on the real estate industry. It seems that only real estate owners are considered to be "easy targets," which, in theory, is not entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Now the national treasury is empty, and we have to resort to the means of increasing the issuance of banknotes to make up for it, which has led to inflation and economic depression, and the national economy is in a precarious situation. If we can open up another source of tax revenue to help adjust, there is naturally nothing wrong with it; however, the standards of the various property taxes set by the Ministry of Finance have too many shortcomings. Fortunately, it is still a draft, and it is not too late to mend the fence after the sheep are lost; it is hoped that the National Economic Commission must carefully discuss and decide before making a decision, so that we do not add another tax policy that disturbs the people in the midst of deep water and hot fire, and also prevent a law from being promulgated hastily, and soon being criticized to the point that the government admits that there are indeed loopholes, and then come to revise it, so as to damage the government's credibility!</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Extends Influence in Southeastern Europe; British Government Reviews Countermeasures; U.S. and Britain to Take Unified Diplomatic Action</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The draft of the U.S. protest to the Soviet Union regarding Hungary, currently under study by the British Foreign Office, has necessitated a review of Britain's entire policy towards Central and Eastern Europe. The complete reorganization of the Hungarian government, the arrest of opposition leader Béla Kovács, the rehabilitation of Yugoslav opposition leader Ivanović, and the imprisonment of members of the Romanian American opposition have marked a new phase in the Soviet Union's influence in Central and Eastern Europe. Diplomatic observers believe these actions are part of a deliberate plan by the Soviet Union to consolidate the position of pro-Soviet elements in the region before the Balkan peace treaties come into effect and Soviet troops withdraw. The question Britain must decide now is whether to wage a genuine battle against serious violations of democratic freedoms, or to formally protest and then acknowledge the expansion of Soviet power, as in the past. The British government's decision on the U.S. protest to Hungary will serve as a guide to Britain's future attitude towards Central and Eastern Europe. The U.S. note states that it will bring charges before the United Nations, intending to oppose Soviet policy in practice, beyond mere formal protests. If Britain approves this policy, it will inevitably be unable to adopt a more lenient stance towards developments in Bulgaria and other countries. Well-informed sources believe that the United States and Britain will take similar diplomatic action in this regard, and it is expected that the two countries will continue consultations before formally submitting notes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] Authorities responsible for diplomacy here state that the United States intends to present a note to the Soviet authorities regarding recent developments in Hungary. Before submitting it, they will seek the opinions of British officials. The wording of the note may be revised accordingly to reduce its severity. The British side believes that the current measures taken regarding the situation in that country should focus on establishing a three-member committee to investigate the entire situation in Hungary. Although the content of the note will not lose its resoluteness, it is generally believed that detailed information about recent developments in Budapest is still lacking, and it is not appropriate to form any final conclusions before understanding the situation. A State Department spokesperson said today that the note to the Soviet authorities has not yet been submitted, and he does not know when it will be sent, but after it is sent, Britain will also submit a similar note. Judging from general signs, the U.S. government does not intend to formally recognize the new regime in Hungary.</p>
<h3>Austrian Communist Party Attempts to Seize Power; United States Closely Monitoring; Romanian Prime Minister Arrives in Yugoslav Capital for Goodwill Visit</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] Reports from Vienna today indicate that the Communist Party is plotting to control the Austrian government. From the capital, Britain has made a second stern request to the Soviet occupation authorities for information regarding the Hungarian Communist Party's seizure of power. Most Western diplomats believe that recent incidents are Stalin's response to the Truman Doctrine. At the same time, Romanian Communist Prime Minister Groza's visit to Yugoslavia is consistent with rumors of a Balkan bloc under firm Soviet control.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Government authorities declared today that the United States is now fully prepared, if necessary to prevent the Communist Party from seizing the Austrian government, to abandon efforts to sign an Austrian peace treaty as soon as possible. In this situation, the United States is prepared to continue occupying Austria indefinitely. Reports from Vienna indicate that the Communist Party's influence over the current coalition government has made the situation in Europe tend towards the type of developments seen in Hungary and Bulgaria. The State Department anticipates that this trend will spread to Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Yugoslav Capital, 7th] Romanian Prime Minister Groza and Foreign Minister Tătărescu, accompanied by the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Agriculture, arrived today for a visit. Yugoslav President Tito hosted a banquet to welcome them. During the banquet, Groza said in his speech that Romania does not wish to expect rescue from overseas, and our strength will ensure our salvation and guarantee our future. We will fight shoulder to shoulder with the Balkan countries to create and consolidate peace. If we can succeed, we can prevent war.</p>
<h3>Hungary Has the Right to Build Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union; Dinnyés Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Budapest, 7th] Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés stated to foreign reporters today that Hungary has the right to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union. When asked what attitude the Hungarian government would take if the matter were brought before the United Nations, Dinnyés said, "The Hungarian government will not keep any secrets and will answer all questions in the United Nations."</p>
<h3>Hungarian Communist Leader Seizes Great Power</h3>
<p>[United Press, Budapest, 7th] The de facto dictator of Hungary is a short, bald-headed Soviet general named Rákosi. Although he only serves as Deputy Prime Minister, Rákosi has seized supreme power since the Communist coup on June 1, which forced Prime Minister Nagy to resign. He is a Soviet citizen, serving as a Major General in the Soviet Army, and is also the head of the Hungarian Communist Party. A year ago, Rákosi accompanied Nagy to Washington to negotiate and obtained U.S. promise to return to Hungary the gold seized from Hungary by Germany.</p>
<h3>Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy Discusses the Course of the Coup; Denies All Allegations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 7th] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy issued a statement here today expressing surprise at recent developments in Hungary. He said that when I came to Switzerland for vacation, the domestic situation was quite satisfactory. On May 18, I received a phone call from Budapest informing me that Lieutenant General Sviridov, the Soviet chairman of the Allied Control Commission, had refused my request to hand over Béla Kovács, the former secretary of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, who had been arrested by the Soviet authorities. At the same time, he provided the Hungarian authorities with Kovács's written testimony, including accusations that I participated in a coup plot. Thereupon, Communist leader and Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi convened an emergency cabinet meeting, resolving to urge me to return home immediately. I telegraphed back that I was ready to return and stated that the allegations against me were groundless. The next day, I called President Tildy again, who also urged me to return and assured me that everything could be resolved. Hungarian Minister to Switzerland, György Gábor, then visited me, carrying letters from Hungarian friends, advising me not to return. I told him that I had decided to return and asked him to call President Tildy again to ask if his warning to me was credible. When I arrived in Bern, Gábor informed me that the President also advised me not to return. On May 30, State Minister Father Balogh called, saying that if I returned to Hungary, there might be accidents along the way, and he suggested that I resign to help resolve the crisis. I replied that the allegations were unfounded, and I had no constitutional reason to resign. However, in order not to make the situation worse, I agreed in principle to resign in accordance with the constitution. Therefore, I did not participate in any conspiracy. If there was a conspiracy, it was a conspiracy against me personally.</p>
<h3>British and American Political Representatives Visit Bulgarian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Inquiring about the Arrest of Petkov</p>
<p>[United Press, Sofia, 8th] The Bulgarian government issued a communiqué today stating that the U.S. and British political representatives to Bulgaria, Pennett and Horner, met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov (Communist) yesterday, with Foreign Minister Georgiev also present. The British and American representatives stated to the Prime Minister that the arrest of opposition leader Petkov might be of "international importance." The communiqué continued, stating that Bulgaria's handing over of Petkov to the judicial authorities was purely a matter of internal affairs, and it hoped that the public would patiently await the verdict of the Bulgarian Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Eden on the Hungarian Political Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, stating that the events in Hungary are a blatant example of interference in the internal affairs of a small country. At present, due to a lack of sufficient information, a final judgment cannot be made. However, the events in that country are clearly an attempt to establish a communist regime in Hungary after the peace treaty comes into effect and Soviet troops withdraw.</p>
<h3>Palestine Fact-Finding Mission Leaves New York for the Holy City; Jewish Congress Condemns British Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] Representatives of the United Nations Palestine Inquiry Committee departed by plane for Jerusalem yesterday. They were forced to return twice due to engine trouble. They took off again today, a total of thirty-six people, including Shertok, a member of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Zionist Movement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The United Nations Palestine Inquiry Committee announced today that 20,728 Jewish refugees in refugee camps in the U.S. occupied zone of Germany have applied to United Nations agencies to immediately facilitate Jewish immigration to Palestine. Previously, United Nations Secretary-General Lie announced that Britain requested that Jewish illegal immigration to Palestine be prevented during the committee's investigation. A spokesperson for the Jewish Congress said that Britain is asking United Nations agencies to authorize and cooperate with an illegal act, making member states accomplices to its conspiracy, which is unbelievable. Today, there are no criminals among the Jews immigrating to Palestine, and prohibiting them from immigrating is illegal. British officials did not immediately comment after hearing this statement from the Jewish Congress.</p>
<h3>Spanish Parliament in Dramatic Performance Passes Law of Succession</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 7th] The Spanish lower house passed the Law of Succession today, restoring the Spanish monarchy, but approving Franco's continuation as the head of state. All members of parliament stood up and cheered. At the same time, supporters of Don Juan, the heir to the Spanish throne, issued a statement in Madrid stating that royalists do not recognize this new law. Government officials expect Franco to submit the succession law to a public vote in early July, but some believe that the vote will not take place until after the summer. The order for holding the referendum has been drafted and is awaiting General Franco's signature. During the discussion, the Speaker of the lower house, Bilbao, defended the succession law, saying that since circumstances require a restoration, the restored monarchy must be a continuous and stable power, and a guarantee of national order. The king is for the people, not the people for the king. The parliament now proposes the establishment of a peace-loving regime to guarantee as much as possible that there is no danger of revolution. He added that Spain has no other leader besides Franco, so the restoration must be agreed upon with Franco, otherwise it cannot be restored. After Bilbao finished speaking, he loudly asked if the parliament passed this law. All members of parliament stood up and answered yes, and cheered for Franco for several minutes.</p>
<h3>U.S. to Expand Aid to Europe to Counter Pan-Slavic Alliance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] Well-informed observers here, in studying Secretary of State Marshall's recent call for "unity" in Europe, are discussing the possibility of the United States providing $6 billion annually in aid to European recovery over the next three years. Washington believes that the immediate need is to help Europe make up for its trade deficits, and then supply the necessary production resources, the beginning of what is called a plan of mutual assistance among related countries. Officials here hope that Britain and France will respond to Marshall's call and first assist in the reconstruction of Europe. The United States cannot openly invite European countries to assist in a reconstruction plan that would prevent countries within the Soviet sphere of influence from participating, but Marshall's call at Harvard University clearly indicates that if Europe can help itself, the United States will immediately respond. U.S. officials fear that Soviet foreign policy will lead to the formation of a Pan-Slavic alliance by the countries of Southeastern Europe in the early summer of this year. If this happens, the United States, Britain, and France must immediately provide reconstruction assistance to the countries of Western and Northern Europe to counter it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>—Translated specifically for this newspaper</p>
<p>The question of how much and what kind of industrial equipment Japan will give to its victorious nations as reparations will soon be clear.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>If the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission is unable to break the current deadlock, then the United States will preemptively order MacArthur to allocate the Japanese factories and machinery designated as reparations to the countries entitled to apply for reparations. Therefore, the Japanese reparations issue is expected to be finally resolved within two months.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, Japan must hand over nearly 1,100 factories. Perhaps it will have to retain the entire textile industry as well as insufficient merchant ships and railway equipment; however, it must hand over all wartime factories and most of the steel, synthetic oil, rubber, shipbuilding and ship repair equipment, machine manufacturing tools, and chemical materials.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The United States is resolving the Japanese issue in advance, intending to enable Japan to become self-sufficient, thereby reducing occupation costs. MacArthur believes that in order to stop the current decline in Japanese industrial production, the reparations issue must be resolved as soon as possible. Some U.S. officials in Washington and Tokyo believe that Japan is using the United Nations' delay in resolving the reparations issue as an excuse not to reorganize the Japanese economy. Once this excuse is eliminated, Japan will have to implement the necessary economic reforms and strive to develop its remaining industries.</p>
<p>Since the Far Eastern Commission issued directives stipulating the minimum level of Japanese industry, the Japanese reparations issue has been largely determined. Since then, the occupying authorities have designated the factories that are not intended for reparations, allowing factory owners to begin restoring production.</p>
<p>(3) The final resolution of the Japanese reparations issue will be based on the recommendations of the U.S. Reparations Commission, chaired by Pauley in 1945, but the original recommendations have been amended by the Far Eastern Commission. Regarding the amount of Japanese industry that each country requesting reparations should receive, the Far Eastern Commission is currently trying to reach a resolution. This is an issue that has caused great controversy, and unless it is resolved quickly, the United States will carry out the allocation in its capacity as the main occupying power.</p>
<p>The main countries requesting reparations are China, Britain, France, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and India. The United States does not intend to request any industrial reparations from Japan, but it may request some industries for the reconstruction of the U.S. occupied zone of Korea.</p>
<p>The secondary countries requesting reparations are: Canada, which participated in the defense of Hong Kong; Mexico, which dispatched an air force squadron to the Far East in the late stages of the war; Outer Mongolia, which fought against Japan for a few days; Portugal, which suffered losses in its Pacific territories and is requesting reparations; and Greece, Norway, and Italy, which are requesting reparations for damage to ships, etc., during the Pacific War.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is partly responsible for the delay in resolving the Japanese reparations issue because it insisted that all Japanese assets in the nine northeastern provinces under Soviet control should be considered "war booty" and separate from reparations. The occupation authorities in Tokyo estimate that the Japanese assets already plundered by the Soviet Union are worth nearly two million dollars.</p>
<p>Thirty percent of the total amount designated for reparations by the United States will be dismantled and allocated to the Far Eastern countries and colonies most severely affected by Japan's war of aggression. When instructing MacArthur to begin the allocation, the U.S. government specifically emphasized that items that can be used for relief immediately should be allocated first.</p>
<p>In the early allocation of reparations, China will receive 15 percent, or approximately 165 factories. However, the Chinese government insists on obtaining another 15 percent in the final settlement.</p>
<p>Five percent will be allocated to the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, British Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong, and Borneo. Australia and France have voiced strong objections to the allocation method. Australia argues that it should receive a share to compensate for the damage caused by the Japanese army in New Guinea, and France believes that it should receive compensation for the damage in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Seven United Nations groups have been investigating industries in Japan that can be used for reparations. U.S. authorities have not yet received formal requests to designate certain factories or machines, so it appears that the dismantling of Japanese factories will not begin in the coming months.</p>
<p>The final decision on dismantling factories rests with MacArthur. MacArthur's current policy is to protect Japan's necessary factories and to prohibit the dismantling of any factory until its equipment and workers have been transferred elsewhere. Therefore, it is expected that the final resolution of the reparations issue will not seriously affect the Japanese economy.</p>
<h3>Marshall Plans to Submit Refugee Immigration Bill to the House, Advocates Allowing 400,000 to Immigrate Over Four Years</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] It is reported that Marshall and his staff will attend the House Judiciary Committee to request the House to pass legislation allowing 400,000 refugees to immigrate to the United States. The legislation is currently being studied by the Judiciary Committee, with most members expressing opposition to the current form of the bill. The bill was proposed by Representative Stratton, allowing 100,000 refugees to immigrate to the United States each year for four years. A House member said that Marshall will attend the House hearing after the subcommittee reports the legislation to the full committee. Secretary of the Army Patterson and Attorney General Clark may also attend the House hearing. A few members of the subcommittee said that they were optimistic about the committee's report on the bill. It is rumored that some members are considering reducing the number of refugees allowed to enter and shortening the period allowed for entry. Supporters of the bill expressed fear that if Congress fails to pass the bill, other countries will not participate in the plan to resolve the issue of millions of refugees in Europe.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan, Roosevelt Has Already Set a Precedent</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative to Greece, Paul, said</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] Paul, former U.S. Price Administrator and current U.S. Presidential Special Investigator on the Greek issue, said at a dinner party for leaders of the Liberal Party today that the late President Roosevelt, in his speech in October 1937, had already set a precedent for today's plan to aid Greece and Turkey. I strongly support President Truman's aid plan because this plan can enable Greece to establish political freedom and free the country from the fear of aggression. However, it is an undeniable fact that there are many corrupt and reactionary elements in the current Greek government. In short, American isolationists should also appeal to peace-loving people to make them understand that if President Truman's plan is not implemented, there will be no peace.</p>
<h3>Wallace Speech</h3>
<p>Explaining Attitude Towards the Democratic Party</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Montgomery, 7th] Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace, speaking here, said: It is still difficult to say at this time whether I will leave the Democratic Party in 1948. If the Democratic Party becomes a party representing war and injustice, then I will no longer be able to support it. The Truman Doctrine is not based on a peace plan, but on a war plan. If this continues and expands, the result will inevitably lead us to a recession. At this point, someone asked if it was possible to organize a third party. Wallace immediately replied that he would do whatever he thought was necessary for peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Montgomery, 7th] Wallace continued his national speaking tour here, saying, "Finding an agreement with the Soviet Union is the main task facing those who formulate American foreign policy."</p>

<h3>General Hodge Released Working Report of Korean Military Government in Tokyo Yesterday; Expanded Authority of South Korean Legislative Assembly</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] As the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission's plan for a Korean provisional government entered its third week, MacArthur disclosed the Korean military government's working report for February on the 8th, stating: The United States has guaranteed the South Korean provisional legislative assembly "a wide range" of government responsibilities. Items that have been submitted to the legislative assembly for discussion include the early formulation of a universal suffrage law and universal suffrage regulations, discussing methods to prevent inflation and tax increases, as well as controlling the black market and salvaging industrial production. In addition, the Korean legislative assembly opposed the suggestion of employing Japanese technicians in Korean industry by an absolute majority of forty-nine to zero. In addition, the U.S. authorities also hope that the Korean legislative assembly will carry out land reform, implement labor laws, eliminate all personnel in the military government who sympathize with the former Japanese oppressive policies, collect grain, allocate and dispose of Japanese property. Lieutenant General Hodge issued a proclamation on February 5, reiterating that the work of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission has not changed the 1945 Moscow Resolution and that it is promoting its realization.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten Consults with Indian Leaders on New Measures for Dividing India; Also Urges Indian Interim Government to Resign</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 7th] A radio station here has just issued a message stating that Indian Governor-General Mountbatten held meetings with leaders of the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Sikh community this morning to discuss measures to be taken to divide India.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] Reliable sources say that Indian Governor-General Mountbatten has requested the entire current Indian interim government to resign. This is believed to be in preparation for establishing two interim governments immediately upon the implementation of the partition plan. In addition, Nehru and his colleagues will submit their resignations in early next week so that the central government, which cannot avoid partition, can be divided into two governments, Pakistan and Hindustan, before the end of June. [Reuters, New Delhi, 7th] After holding a two-day meeting with three leaders from the Congress Party, three leaders from the Muslim League, and one Sikh leader, Indian Governor-General Mountbatten is expected to determine the charter of the border demarcation committee for the provinces of Bengal and Punjab. These seven major leaders are Nehru, Patel, and Kripalani from the Congress Party, Jinnah, Ali Khan, and Nishtar from the Muslim League, and Singh from the Sikh community. The Muslim League Council is scheduled to meet on Monday to approve Britain's plan to transfer power in India because Jinnah only offered verbal acceptance with reservations, and the final decision must be made by the Muslim League Council.</p>
<h3>Respect for Freedom of Residents of French India</h3>
<p>It is also reported that the Governor-General of French India, Baron, stated that the National Congress would not exert pressure on the residents of French India. Nehru and Jinnah have both acknowledged that the residents of French India have complete freedom to decide their future constitution. The future of the Gorkha people has yet to be decided. A senior Indian military officer stated that approximately 16,000 Gorkha soldiers in ten brigades were originally planned to be retained within the Indian Army. It is now understood that approximately 8,000 soldiers in five brigades will be incorporated into the British Army and stationed in Ceylon. Therefore, the Indian Army will only retain approximately 8,000 soldiers.</p>

<h3>German Prime Ministers' Conference Concludes, Adopts Multiple Resolutions to Be Submitted to Allied Control Council, Prime Ministers of Soviet Zone States Did Not Participate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Munich, 7th] The conference of the prime ministers of the states in the British, American, and French zones of Germany, which was held here, has now declared its conclusion. As a result, multiple resolutions have been formed, listing various demands to be submitted to the Allied Control Council and the military governments of each zone. Since this conference decided not to discuss the issue of political unification, the prime ministers of the Soviet zone states withdrew before the conference. The issues involved in the resolutions include food, coal, industry, denazification, and transportation. The main points include allowing Germany to enjoy fishing rights equal to those of other countries (including whaling), land reform, the minimum coal needs for this winter, establishing a prisoner-of-war control bureau, and that denazification laws should apply to all zones. The economic resolutions also call for loans to import food and raw materials so that German traders can participate in the world market. Other requests include reducing the burden of occupation, seeking the opinions of German experts to immediately revise Germany's industrialization plan, and that relations with the occupying countries should be determined in accordance with the Hague Convention. Observers were surprised by the boldness of the aforementioned requests. Six months ago, such a request would have been unimaginable. The intention of the conference is clearly to use these resolutions to attract public attention, showing that it is not affected by the withdrawal of the prime ministers of the Soviet zone. However, it is generally believed that the latter's withdrawal is sufficient to indicate the failure of this conference.</p>

<h3>Municipal Food Allocation Committee Established Today, Overseeing the Rationing of Rice, Grain, and Cooking Oil, Investigation of the Number of Poor People to Be Conducted in Each District Starting Today, Distribution of Food Rations for Public School Employees for May Begins</h3>
<p>The Municipal Food Allocation Committee of this city is scheduled to be formally established at the Shandong Native Place Association Hall at 10:00 AM today and begin its work. The concurrently serving Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Wu Kaixian, will hold an establishment meeting with all committee members and discuss various issues. It is understood that after the establishment of the committee, it will carry out three important tasks: (1) The allocation of rice to factories and schools has been registered by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the first batch of more than 20,000 shi (a unit of dry measure) has also been approved. In the future, the committee will be responsible for unified management. (2) The allocation of rice to impoverished households, the implementation measures have been approved by the Municipal Council. The investigation of the number of impoverished households will be carried out by the Baojia (local administrative units) chiefs in each district starting today, to serve as the basis for issuing rice ration certificates. (3) For the allocation of cooking oil, the existing Joint Food Oil Allocation Office will be under the jurisdiction of the committee to ensure unified allocation. In addition, the allocation of rice to factories and agricultural schools will soon be expanded, and professional personnel and industrial workers will be able to enjoy the right to rice rations. In August, it will be further expanded to a city-wide household ration of one dou (another unit of dry measure) per person.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the person in charge of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, the warehouse has prepared rice for the city's rations and is determined to open four warehouses every day, with a maximum output of 12,000 bags per day. It is also stated that the municipal school employees' food rations for May have been notified to the rice and flour shops to begin receiving goods, and they can be sold separately starting from today. The selling price is the same as last month and has not changed.</p>
<h3>City Council Authorizes Discussion of New Standards for Slaughtered Animal Weight</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The slaughter tax rate in this city is 5%, and the tax amount and weight of slaughtered animals are subject to a specified average standard. Cattle are calculated at 200 catties (a unit of weight) per head, calves at 33 catties, sheep at 20 catties, and pigs at 80 catties. Because the Municipal Finance Bureau had previously decided to actively reorganize tax revenue at the City Council meeting, it believed that the specified weight standards were inconsistent. After sending personnel for on-site inspections and investigations, a total of 125 heads of cattle were weighed, with a total weight of 44,494 catties, averaging 355 catties per head. It has been verified as 300 catties, an increase of 100 catties compared to the original standard. The average weight of calves is 51 catties, which is verified as 50 catties, an increase of 17 catties compared to the original standard. The average weight of pigs is slightly more than 86 catties, which is verified as 80 catties, remaining the same as the original. Each sheep will also remain at 20 catties. However, the verified standards are opposed by meat merchants, who believe they are too high. The case has now been authorized by the City Council plenary session to be discussed by the subcommittee.</p>
<h3>Intensify Preventive Work to Eliminate Summer Epidemics</h3>
<p>[Our Report] With the arrival of midsummer, cholera has not yet been discovered in various parts of the country. However, because it was quite prevalent last year, it is generally predicted that there will still be some lingering effects this year. The municipal health authorities have paid close attention to this and are intensifying preventive work. Among the 200,000 shantytowns in the city, which are considered sources of infection, 70-80% have been vaccinated against epidemics. Other measures, such as fly prevention and elimination, opening water sources, DDT spraying, food and beverage management, and soil disinfection, are also being implemented in conjunction with each other. The immunization goal for this summer is 2 million people, and more than 400,000 people have been vaccinated so far.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) - Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) Passenger Plane from the United States Has Not Arrived</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The first passenger plane of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) on the China-US route returning from the United States did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday.

<h3>Dispute over Foreign Currency Deposits of the Former French Municipal Council, French Consulate Sends Letter to Liquidation Team, Hoping to Continue Negotiations for Resolution</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Although the method for former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese employees to register for and receive retirement benefits has been announced, the issue of the payment of savings funds for former French Concession employees and police officers has not yet been resolved. The reason is that the Liquidation Team of the assets and debts of the former French Concession held a meeting and decided: (1) Chinese employees of the former French Concession police force can register with the savings certificate issued by Mr. Fabre, the former Chief of the French Police; (2) The multiple of increase shall be calculated according to the salary multiple of civil servants of the Shanghai Administrative Organ at the time of payment; (3) The savings to be paid shall be paid from the foreign currency deposits of the former French Municipal Council in banks such as Chase, Citibank, and HSBC that have been frozen. The remaining amount will be requested from the central government. After the decision was made, a notice was published in the newspaper asking the Chinese employees of the former French Police Department to register. From April 16 to April 30, a total of 1,143 people registered, and the total amount of their savings when the pseudo-municipal government took over the French Concession in 1942 totaled Central Reserve Bank notes 1,253,488.16 yuan. If it is refunded according to the conversion of 200 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes to 1 yuan of legal tender today, very little will be obtained. Therefore, it was decided to calculate and pay according to the multiple of the civil servant's salary.</p>
<p>The current problem is the foreign currency deposits of the French Municipal Council in banks such as Chase, Citibank, and HSBC that have been frozen, totaling US$1,275,211.15 and £14,579 14 shillings and 1 pence. The Chinese government believes that assets must be liquidated in order to assume debts, and these deposits should be returned to the Chinese government. On the French side, it is said that after the pseudo-government took over the concession, the French government advanced a larger amount of money to cover the living expenses and return travel expenses of the French employees of the former French Concession administrative authority than the amount of the deposits, and should be used to offset the outstanding payments first. However, the municipal government found in the files taken over that the French side had agreed with the pseudo-government that the maintenance costs and return travel expenses would be borne by the French side, so it does not recognize this. At the previous plenary session discussion, Mayor Wu had a disagreement with the French representative due to this issue, and the issue was delayed. It is now learned that the French Consulate General sent a letter to the Liquidation Team yesterday, hoping to continue negotiations in order to seek a solution.</p>
<h3>YMCA Launches Summer Program</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that summer has arrived, the Chinese YMCA is about to launch a summer program that will benefit the youth's body and mind: (1) Health Campaign - will be held at the end of this month. This campaign includes exhibitions, physical examinations, and bodybuilding competitions, focusing on preventing tuberculosis and opposing spitting anywhere. In order to be universal and thorough, it is also planned to make a "Oppose Spitting Anywhere" song, and lyrics and scores are now being publicly solicited. Anyone who applies will receive 300,000 yuan once accepted, but the lyrics or scores must be submitted to the YMCA by the 15th of this month. (2) Summer Academy for Employed Youths - The courses of the academy are divided into journalism, politics, economics, literature and art, history, psychology, philosophy, etc. It will be open from July 1 to August 31, for a total of two months. As for the swimming pool, it will also be open immediately, and a summer camp for young people will be organized to be held in Xikou and other places.</p>

In addition to various exhibitions and ball games, an educational movie was shown in the evening, and the child opera stars Zhang Zhimei and Zhang Zhili performed the Beijing opera "San Niang Teaches Her Son".</p>
<h3>30 Municipal Hospitals Added for Rabies Vaccination</h3>

There are approximately 10,000 domestic dogs in the city, which will cost 200 million yuan, which is still to be submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion. When it is implemented in the future, a portion of the cost may be recovered from the dog owners.

<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei Broadcasts, Public Health Facilities and Measures Over the Past Year, With Summer Approaching, People are Warned to Maintain Cleanliness and Protect Health Together</h3>
<p>[Our Report] This newspaper held its tenth Sunday special broadcast at the Cooperative Radio Station yesterday, inviting Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau to speak on "Public Health Facilities in This City Over the Past Year." The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>It has been exactly one year since I took office as the Director of the Health Bureau on June 10 last year. I will now divide the public health facilities of the past year into five items and give a comprehensive report.</p>
<p>Prevention and Control of Epidemics</p>
<p>(1) Prevention and Control of Cholera: Last year, cholera was prevalent. After the joint efforts of all sectors of society to cooperate and inject vaccines, vaccinations have already started on April 16 this year, with the goal of completing 2 million people. Other measures, such as disinfection of patients' homes, disinfection of drinking water, opening 74 fire hydrants, adding safe water supply stations in civilian areas, DDT eradication of flies and mosquitoes, and other measures such as saline injections, stool inspections, and traffic quarantine, are all sufficient to reassure the citizens. This year, we will promote prevention work even more vigorously. (2) Compulsory Vaccination: In the spring of this year, compulsory vaccination was implemented, and 1.5 million people have been vaccinated as of May. Other diseases, such as diphtheria, meningitis, epidemic typhus, dysentery, smallpox, scarlet fever, and relapsing fever, have also had sporadic cases, but thanks to our efforts in prevention and control, they have not become widespread. There have been more cases of dog disease, but the mortality rate is still low.</p>
<p>Cleaning Work</p>
<p>(1) Garbage Removal: The average daily garbage production in this city is approximately 2,500 tons. The population has increased after the war, but there are only 3,500 sanitation workers. In addition, due to high prices and insufficient budget, the amount of garbage removed in a year under such difficult circumstances totaled 900,000 tons. (2) Removal of Feces: The average daily number of vehicles of feces to be removed by the Cleaning Bureau in this city is 7.315. However, the work is greatly affected due to the dilapidated vehicles and the long-term disrepair of the docks. We are now planning to solicit bids from merchants to contract the work in order to improve it. On the one hand, we still have to emphasize that citizens pay attention to public morality and jointly maintain cleanliness in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Medical Relief</p>
<p>(1) Increased Free Beds: The number of beds in municipal hospitals in this city was originally only 909. A total of 400 beds have been added over the years. The municipal government has allocated funds to subsidize 278 fully free beds and 235 half-free beds. This year, 50 free beds for tuberculosis patients and 40 free beds for laborers have been added, and free clinics are also subsidized. (2) Low-Priced Medicine Distribution: Two mobile clinics provide completely free services in poor areas. Recently, 100 members of the Medical Association and more than 70 pharmacies that are members of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association have been specially contracted to add the stamps "Poor" and "Low Price" to prescriptions, which can be used to reduce fees and provide preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Insurance Diversification Facilities</p>
<p>(1) Maternal and Child Health Care: 5,332 people had prenatal check-ups, 5,372 people had safe deliveries, 9,511 post-natal care visits, 160 mothers' meetings, 465 children's meetings, and 497 infant health clinic visits in various municipal hospitals and health offices in the past year. (2) School Health: In the past year, student health examinations totaled 86,756 people, defect correction 127,831 cases, disease treatment 19,184 cases, isolation of infected persons 180 cases, vaccination 89,425 people, health education 142,146 times, and environmental hygiene inspections 1,742 times. (3) Children's and Youth Health Campaign: In the past year, a total of 72,760 children and youths participated in health examinations. The number of people whose defects have been corrected is 20,940, and defect correction is still in progress.</p>
<p>Medical and Health Management</p>
<p>All hospitals, doctors, dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, pharmaceutical students, nurses, midwives, Chinese and Western medicine merchants, as well as vegetable markets, milk farms, slaughterhouses, public cemeteries, crematoriums, mortuaries, funeral homes, barber shops, bathrooms, food commodities, and vendors in this city are under the jurisdiction of this bureau for health management. We pay close attention to cleanliness and hygiene and supervise and correct them at any time. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that midsummer is coming soon. Cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, malaria, enteritis, etc. are all summer epidemics. They may be discovered any day. Please everyone be vigilant at all times, be careful about diet, prevent malarial mosquitoes, be diligent in cleaning, and protect our homes together.</p>
<h3>Cries Outside Xiaonanmen, Miracle in the Fire, More Than 40 Thatched Sheds Burned Down, One Household in the Center is Safe</h3>
<p>[Our Report] More than 40 thatched sheds have been built in the Diandang Lane area of Nancang Street outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi, and most of the residents are tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers. At 2:10 PM yesterday, Zhu Dezhuang (28 years old, from Huai'an), a resident of No. 28, accidentally dropped sparks on the thatched shed while cooking, causing a fire. In addition, the wind fanned the flames, and in an instant, they spread to the neighboring shantytowns, turning them into a sea of fire. After receiving the alarm, the Shanghai South District Fire Fighting Association immediately dispatched more than ten pump trucks to rescue the fire. Due to the narrow location and lack of water sources, the fire was not extinguished until 4:30 PM. When reporters went to inspect the scene after the incident, they saw that all the thatched sheds had turned into scorched earth, and some women and children were still trying to find relics in the ashes. Many people were wailing in grief. The most amazing thing is that the Zhang family's shed at No. 57 in the center was safe and sound. Mrs. Zhang believes that God is protecting them, so she specially prepared incense candles to light and worship Heaven.</p>
<h3>Joint Conference of Labor Associations Discusses Wage Issues, Petitions the Minister of Economic Affairs Afterward, Requesting Restoration to the Base Figure of Late 1936</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Industrial Association Directors Hu Boxiang, Rong Hongyuan (represented by Zhang Mengzhao), Yan Yaoqiu, Dong Shuying, Tian Heqing, and members of the Industrial Trade Associations' Living Cost Index Wage Study Group Liu Qingyi, Ye Fukan, Yang Liren, Xue Huichen, Yao Siwei, Qian Mengwei, Pan Xingyu, Song Baolin, Zhang Zhiming, and fourteen others, held a joint conference yesterday afternoon at the Industrial Association on Xiangyang Road to discuss the issue of wage payments after the lifting of the living cost index freeze. They immediately drafted a telegram to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting two things: (A) that wages be paid according to the current living cost index, and that the wage level of 1936 be restored as the base for wage calculation; (B) that before a reasonable adjustment to the living cost index and base salary is obtained, this month's wages be temporarily paid according to last month's index.</p>
<p>Planning to Organize Security Insurance</p>
<p>As factories fear worker strikes or the threat of gatherings, they plan to establish a security insurance organization through the Industrial Association. If any factory is destroyed by worker violence, the organization will fully compensate for the losses, while the Industrial Association will legally file a lawsuit, demanding compensation from the authorities and the labor union. (This proposal is temporarily reserved for detailed planning by the Industrial Association's board of directors.) They also plan to request protection for factories from the security authorities to strictly prevent illegal activities by workers. At the same time, it was resolved that each industrial trade association should investigate the evolution of pre-war and post-victory wages in their respective industries, as well as the actual income of workers calculated using the existing base salary and index, filling out a detailed survey form to be submitted to the central government by the Industrial Association for reference. After the meeting, all representatives went to the International Hotel to petition Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who was in Shanghai, and submitted the aforementioned telegram. Hu Boxiang, Tian Heqing, Yan Yaoqiu, and others described the current crisis facing the industrial sector and the difficulties faced by factories under the pressure of high wages.</p>
<p>Promise to Submit Request to the Executive Yuan for Discussion</p>
<p>Minister Chen promised to forward their requests to the Executive Yuan. Regarding the adjustment of the living cost index or base salary, he will also consult with the heads of the Ministry of Social Affairs and other relevant departments after returning to Nanjing to seek a balanced solution that takes into account both protecting workers' livelihoods and ensuring the "reproduction" capacity of employers, submitting it to the National Economic Conference for discussion. Representatives of the Industrial Association will gather at the Handkerchief Trade Association on Jiujiang Road at 9:00 AM this morning to petition the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau again.</p>

<h3>A Milestone in Railway History: The Railway Bureau Self-Manufactures Streamlined Train</h3>
<p>The Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Administration, considering the high cost of ordering vehicles from abroad, directed its Qishuyan Machinery Plant to independently manufacture a single vehicle to save foreign exchange. After several months of effort, four blue steel-skinned cars have now been officially completed.

The Railway Administration's self-manufacture of streamlined passenger cars, with all designs based on European and American models and incorporating scientific methods, is truly a milestone in China's railway history.</p>

<h3>Regulations for Purchasing Enemy and Puppet Buildings Set by the Liquidation Office</h3>
<p>Regarding the enemy and puppet buildings on privately owned land and the enemy and puppet buildings on land requisitioned by the enemy and puppet regimes, regulations have been formulated for unified handling. However, it has recently been discovered that some enemy and puppet buildings are not built on the land of the same owner, and the land has been approved for return or redemption of property rights after application by the owner. Except for land with barracks and airport buildings, which are requisitioned according to law, the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office is now formulating a method for other alley residences: (1) The landowners will jointly purchase the building. If the landowners cannot jointly purchase, and one of the landowners is willing to purchase alone while the other landowners express their willingness to give up, they may be allowed to purchase alone. (2) If none of the landowners are willing to purchase, the government will take over and sell the building through bidding. This method will be implemented after it is reviewed and approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee this week.</p>

<h3>Zhang Boling Returns to Tianjin Tomorrow - Expresses Thoughts on Student Protests to Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's dispatch] Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, having completed his participation in the Political Consultative Council, came to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago and is scheduled to return to Tianjin tomorrow with Professor Zhang Zi-jian of the university via China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight. The Shanghai Alumni Association of the university welcomed Mr. Zhang at Fengzelou in the International Hotel yesterday at 3:00 PM, with more than 70 alumni in attendance. In his speech to the alumni, Mr. Zhang first stated that he personally was not as optimistic about the current situation as before, but he was not pessimistic about it. He said that domestic peace and stability are what the people of the whole country are seeking, and the Political Consultative Council had organized a special committee for this purpose, spending a day and two nights thoroughly researching and discussing the peace plan, still based on the two points of "political democratization and nationalization of the army." The plan was submitted to the government for reference and announced to the people, and it is hoped that members of the Chinese Communist Party will come to Nanjing to jointly seek a path to peace. Mr. Zhang used the analogy of the country being a house, and if the walls collapse and the house falls, everyone will suffer damage. He encouraged the alumni to take the "nation" as the premise, to maintain composure, and to overcome difficulties together. Mr. Zhang was pleased that the Nankai alumni working in the Tianjin municipal authorities, the Senate, and various other aspects in Tianjin were able to cooperate seamlessly. Subsequently, Professor Huang Zi-jian, who came with Mr. Zhang, reported on the school's affairs in great detail, and explained that the political consciousness of young students is now higher than before, but the political struggle of Nankai students is not as sharp as that of other universities, and there have never been any incidents of mutual beatings. This is because they can all understand that students also have the identity of citizens, and can engage in any political activities outside the school, but within the school they only know how to study. The professors also never have factions due to different political opinions. This is all due to President Zhang's influence. Later, at the request of reporters, Mr. Zhang expressed his feelings about the student protests, saying: This student protest cannot be said to have no background, nor can it be said to have a complete background. The main reason is that it was triggered by high prices. If the authorities of each school had been able to properly resolve the students' livelihood problems in advance, the student protest might not have expanded so much. Also, according to Professor Huang Zi-jian of the engineering school; the establishment of the College of Engineering at the school, with the establishment of three departments of chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, has been approved by the Ministry of Education and is currently undergoing procedures. Enrollment will begin next semester.</p>

<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs Discusses Fuel Issues, Remedial Measures Have Been Drafted, Textile Adjustment Committee to be Established Soon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Economic Minister Chen Qitian, accompanied by Vice Minister Zhang Zizhu and others, went to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to individually summon the heads of various institutions affiliated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai for discussions. Those present included Securities Supervision Officer Wu Zongbi, General Manager of the China Silk Company Ge Jingzhong, Director of the Spinning and Construction Company Wang Dasui, General Manager of the China Vegetable Oil Factory Zhang Yujiu, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee Xu Letian, and Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau Cai Wuji. The meeting concluded at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>When Chen met with reporters at 11:00 AM, he stated that the purpose of his trip was to inspect the affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and talk with the people in charge. As of today, there are several things that can be reported: (1) The fuel problem is very serious due to the difficulty in obtaining sources. I have thoroughly discussed it with Mr. Xu Letian and drafted remedial measures, so there will be no major problems at present. (2) The government has decided to establish a Textile Adjustment Committee to replace the former Textile Management Committee. During my visit to Shanghai, I have consulted with Mr. Zou Rongwen three times. Mr. Zou is an agricultural expert and has studied the textile industry, so I have invited him to serve as the chairman. After personally requesting him, there are generally no more problems. After I return to Beijing and determine the organizational measures, the Adjustment Committee can be established in the short term. It is expected that after the establishment of this committee, it will greatly benefit the improvement of the production and sales of yarn and cloth in our country.</p>
<p>(3) Yesterday afternoon, I had a sincere conversation with the responsible personnel of the Spinning and Construction Company. All members had previously submitted their resignations, but after my repeated persuasion, they have agreed to continue to be responsible. During the tenure of former Minister Wang, General Manager Shu made outstanding contributions to the development of Spinning and Construction. With his vast experience and responsible work ethic, the future of the Spinning and Construction Company is very promising. Yesterday, I visited the 17th Textile Factory and Dyeing and Weaving Factory of the Spinning and Construction Company and was very impressed, but I regret that I was unable to inspect everything due to the limited time. (4) On the evening of the 6th, the heads of the affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai hosted a public banquet for me at the Jinmen Hotel. The responsible personnel in Shanghai are all working hard and diligently, which is commendable. I am determined to be humble and sincere, seek truth from facts, and ensure that technical personnel and working staff can work with peace of mind. I am also willing to accept any good suggestions. Shanghai is an important location and has a close relationship with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. I hope to have close cooperation with the municipal authorities and leaders of the business community to solve various economic problems, especially those related to Shanghai. Furthermore, yesterday at noon, Xu Jigong, Li Ming, and other leaders of the Shanghai business community hosted a banquet for Chen at the Hongqiao Club. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mayor Wu will hold a tea party to introduce Chen to various people in the city.</p>

<h3>The Silk Production and Sales Promotion Association Passes Measures for Entrusting the Collection of Spring Cocoons</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee recently passed a measure for entrusting the collection of spring cocoons at its sixth committee meeting. The full text of this measure is as follows: 1. In order to regulate the funds used by cocoon firms in various regions for collecting cocoons, the association has negotiated with the China Silk Company to borrow funds from the China Farmers Bank and hand them over to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang offices of the association for regulation. (The northern Anhui region will be handled by the China Silk Company itself.)</p>
<p>2. The regulation of funds for cocoon firms is limited to the following two items:</p>
<p>(1) Cocoon firms that have been approved for establishment but have not yet had manufacturers come to collect cocoons, and where it is necessary to establish a firm to collect cocoons.</p>
<p>(2) Cocoon firms of various manufacturers whose funds for collecting cocoons exceed the prescribed quota and have no remaining funds available for transfer, and where there are still surplus cocoons in the area, the quality of the cocoons is good, and the equipment and management of the cocoon firm are complete.</p>
<p>However, in cases where manufacturers have cocoon loan remittances that have not arrived and there is an urgent need to pay cocoon farmers, they may be given a discretionary advance loan, but after the remittance arrives, it should be repaid as soon as possible.</p>
<p>3. When entrusting cocoon collection, the group leader, together with representatives of the cocoon firms and cocoon collecting manufacturers, shall sign a contract for entrusted cocoon collection with the association's office, and each cocoon collecting manufacturer shall be responsible for guaranteeing it.</p>
<p>4. The quantity of entrusted cocoon collection shall be approved by the office at its discretion, and cocoon funds shall be paid at any time according to actual needs. When cocoon collection is completed, any remaining funds shall be returned in full immediately.</p>
<p>5. When receiving cocoon funds, the group leader accepting the entrusted cocoon collection shall, together with each cocoon collecting manufacturer, fill out a receipt form, attach a receipt, and submit it to the office or branch office for verification before drawing from the lending bank. In addition to the receipt form being kept and transferred as required, a copy of the receipt shall be submitted to the association for record.</p>
<p>6. The entrusted small group and the manufacturer of the entrusted firm shall strictly comply with the regulations of the association in terms of the drying discount, reeling discount, payment of cocoon prices, and all expenses of the entrusted cocoon collection. If there is any fraud in drying or any other violation of regulations, the small group and the manufacturer of the entrusted firm shall bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>7. The silkworm cocoons collected on behalf of the entrusted party shall be allocated proportionally according to the regulations and the actual amount of cocoons collected at the end of the cocoon business. After entering the warehouse, all the dry cocoons allocated shall be handed over to the China Silk Company for storage. When allocating the excess cocoons collected by each cocoon firm, the dry cocoons shall be distributed by drawing lots based on the total amount of dry cocoons dried by each cocoon firm and the proportion of fresh cocoons collected. The cocoon price and all fees paid shall also be borne proportionally within the prescribed limits.</p>
<p>8. The procedures for distributing the above-mentioned silkworm cocoons to manufacturers will be determined separately. However, the manufacturers of the contracting small group and firm shall be given preferential treatment to reward their labor for handling the agency.</p>
<p>9. The various reports to be filled out and submitted for entrusted cocoon collection shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the association, but the words "entrusted cocoon collection" must be clearly indicated for identification.</p>
<p>10. All procedures for entrusted cocoon collection shall be handled in accordance with the various regulations of the association. Any matters not covered shall be decided by the association on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<h3>蘇省繭汛　量志質均有進步</h3>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Cocoon News: Volume, Quality, and Enthusiasm All Improved</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Economy, considering that cocoon firms in various parts of Jiangsu have all started weighing, dispatched personnel to Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places on the 5th of this month to inspect the cocoon collection situation in various districts. It is understood that the general impression of this inspection was very good. Since the price of cocoons was increased by 20% based on the original price, to 1.2 million yuan per dan, the interest of cocoon farmers has doubled. After collecting cocoons, they actively organized mulberry fields and carried out fertilization work. Currently, the amount of fresh cocoons collected in Jiangsu has reached 70,000 dan, and it is estimated that another 40,000 to 50,000 dan can be collected. The total amount of cocoons collected may reach 110,000 to 120,000 dan. Once the increased cocoon loan of 50 billion yuan is remitted, it can be fully collected. According to a senior official of the Four Joint Office, after inspecting various districts in Jiangsu, it is believed that in addition to the originally increased loan of 50 billion yuan, another 30 billion yuan is needed to meet the needs, and relevant parties are currently negotiating to apply for an increased loan. In terms of general quality, it has improved compared to last year. The work of drying cocoons in various firms is also stricter than last year. It is expected that the cocoons collected will be completely dried in another three to four days. The cocoon collection work in Zhejiang has come to an end, with more than 90,000 dan of fresh cocoons collected.</p>
<h3>皖北開始收繭</h3>
<h3>Cocoon Collection Begins in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>This spring, the sericulture industry in northern Anhui was guided by the China Silk Company, which distributed improved silkworm eggs. Cocoon collection has recently begun. To understand the actual situation, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Yin Liangying, the director of the secretariat of the company, who returned from an inspection in northern Anhui yesterday. According to him, the Anhui sericulture industry was said to be developed, and before the war, the sericulture industries of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui were mentioned in the same breath. During the war, it was severely damaged. Only northern Anhui retained cocoon drying equipment. Hao County has 12 sets of cocoon drying stoves, and this spring, 10,000 egg sheets were distributed. Bo County has 7 sets of cocoon drying stoves, and Taihe has 8 sets. Each distributed 6,000 egg sheets. The silkworms developed well and have already started cocooning. The best results were 40 jin of cocoons per egg sheet, and the average was about 8 jin per egg sheet. Cocoon collection points have been set up separately in the suburbs of Hao County, Junyang, Huamiao, and Taihe Shuipu, where the cocoon drying stoves are located. Bo County has collected more than 400 dan, Hao County more than 100 dan, and Taihe only more than 60 dan because the cocoon funds were robbed by bandits. All are still continuing to purchase. It is expected that the total amount of cocoons collected will be more than 1,000 dan. The highest price for improved cocoons is 7,500 yuan per jin. Northern Anhui has been flooded by the Yellow River for many years, and the people are poor. The cocoon farmers are all happy to receive benefits. Mr. Yin also said that this spring's pilot program in northern Anhui had too few silkworm eggs, and that nine out of ten mulberry leaves along the way were not used, which is a pity. If the sericulture industry is developed in Feidong, Fuyang, Taihe, Linquan, Mengcheng, Hao County, Woyang, and other counties, at least 100,000 egg sheets must be distributed. Moreover, northern Anhui is a continental plain with a dry climate and a dense population. The future of the sericulture industry is very promising.</p>

<h3>產區存棉減少　各地棉價飛漲</h3>
<h3>Cotton Stocks in Production Areas Decrease, Cotton Prices Soar Everywhere</h3>
<p>According to textile industry news: Since this month, cotton stocks in various cotton production areas have been decreasing daily, and prices have continued to soar. According to statistics, the market price in Nanjing has increased by 253% compared to last month, making it one of the places with the highest price increase. Chongqing increased by 129%, Hankou by 46%, Tianjin by 21%, Huaiyang by 72%, Qingdao by 150%, Fuzhou by 192%, and Kunming by 36%. Even in Shanghai, the price has increased by 96% compared to last month. With the new cotton not yet on the market, the price of old cotton is soaring so much that the future of the textile industry is in danger. According to sources, the main reason for the increase in cotton prices is that a certain party is purchasing heavily in the production areas, leading to this situation.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Gold and Silver Shops Across the Country Petition in Beijing Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Implementation Plan, which prohibits the buying and selling of gold bars and stipulates that gold ornaments should also be collected at official prices, the gold and silver shop industry across the country has been in a state of semi-shutdown. Although representatives from various places have repeatedly petitioned in Beijing, the authorities have not yet provided concrete solutions. It is now known that the Shanghai Gold and Silver Shop Association, represented by Wu Pengnian and Yao Guixiang, the standing directors of the association, once again joined representatives from Hunan, Hubei, Beiping, Tianjin, Xinjiang, Taiwan, and other places to petition in Beijing for the last time. It is reported that there is a phenomenon of closure and change of business in the gold and silver shop industry in Shanghai. If the petition still yields no results, all stores will be forced to shut down completely around the holiday.</p>

<h3>本年浙茶滯銷　浙建廳正謀補救</h3>
<h3>Zhejiang Tea Sales Stagnant This Year, Zhejiang Construction Department Seeks Remedies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 8th] The tea production in Zhejiang Province this year has fallen into a difficult situation. More than 100 tea factories in the province have not yet started purchasing raw tea. According to estimates by the Construction Department, the tea production in various places this year is less than last year. The total amount of tea purchased for export is more than 60,000 dan, and the amount for domestic sales is 50,000 dan. The situation this year is dire, mainly due to the low price. Currently, the market price in Shanghai is between 400,000 and 500,000 yuan per zu of raw tea. However, the cost for tea farmers is also 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. As a result, tea merchants are reluctant to purchase, causing millions of tea farmers across the province to sigh at the state of the tea industry. The Construction Department has suggested to the central government that the government purchase tea at the actual cost, similar to the current method of purchasing silk, in order to provide relief.</p>

<h3>High-End Cigarettes Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market situation was that Yongtaihe will distribute 50 packs of Qialike and 10 packs of Da Ying Lao Dao brand cigarettes. It was also heard that Sino-American Tobacco Company will distribute "Samsung and Black Label" two types today (9th), and the factory price is lower than the original, so the market is tired and cannot be revived, and the transactions in the market are also quiet. In the morning, ten packs of Da Ying opened at 6.1 million yuan, and once fell to 0.08 million yuan. Then there were scattered sales, and transactions occurred slightly at 120,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the market tightened slightly, and Da Ying cigarettes rose to 6.13 million yuan, a recovery of 20,000 yuan from Saturday. However, Lao Dao continued to fall by 130,000 yuan due to distribution. Throughout the day, the trend was that the high-end Da Nan Wei Da San Pao and the hot-selling stocks of the Shanghai merchant cigarettes remained firm. The remaining Meili Qianmen brand and American strip cigarettes mostly continued to weaken. As for the 50-pack listened cigarettes, there was no lack of absorption. San Wu brand Qialike sailors and others were all quite smart.</p>
<h3>香港銀行家商討　防目僑匯逃港辦法</h3>
<h3>Hong Kong Bankers Discuss Measures to Prevent Overseas Chinese Remittances from Fleeing to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 8th] When bankers here informally discussed issues related to capital, especially overseas Chinese remittances fleeing to Hong Kong, they suggested abolishing the current official exchange rate. It is understood that Rogers, a British consultant to the Central Bank, has rejected this suggestion. Bankers here believe that the large difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate is the only factor causing overseas Chinese remittances to flee to Hong Kong. Because in Hong Kong, legal tender can be exchanged at black market prices, the black market price of US dollars here is about 35,000 yuan. The bankers believe that the only way to absorb overseas Chinese remittances is to adopt a free exchange rate determined by supply and demand. However, it is reported that Rogers said that he could not accept such opinions, because the official price could not be adjusted in the near future. He believed that adjusting foreign exchange at this time would affect the entire national economic policy. It is understood that the remittances from overseas Chinese in Malaya, the Philippines, Borneo, Siam, Annam, and other places are estimated to be at least 2 million Hong Kong dollars per month. It is not yet known what measures the Chinese government will take to address this serious situation. It is believed that the rumor that a financial institution has been established within the Hong Kong Central Bank seems to be the measure taken by the government.</p>

<h3>Rebuilding Shandong</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Jinan via Air, Three Days - From Our Special Correspondent, Li Tian</p>
<p>Following the assumption of command by Commander Wang Yaowu, who concurrently manages the administration of Shandong, a three-year governance program for Shandong province was drafted based on the principle of equal emphasis on politics and military affairs, under a unified military-political system. In January of this year, a pacification zone political affairs conference was convened, which adopted many practical and feasible resolutions, and formulated key points for Shandong Province's emergency coordination with military affairs. These three elements serve as the guiding principles for all administrative actions in Shandong Province. Although the rampant activities of the Communist forces and the fluctuating military situation have frequently increased difficulties in implementing the program over the past six months, Wang Yaowu has persevered in his determination to create a new Shandong.</p>
<p>Originally, the county grading system established by the central government based on population, taxation, etc., was no longer applicable under the current special circumstances in Shandong. To address reality, the Shandong Provincial Government decided to divide counties into the following five levels based on the degree to which government orders could be implemented: (1) Controlled Area, (2) Semi-Controlled Area, (3) Strongpoint Controlled Area, (4) Mobile Area, (5) Occupied Area. It was stipulated that Controlled Areas and Semi-Controlled Areas would have seven departments, Strongpoint Controlled Areas would have civil affairs and military affairs departments, and Mobile Areas and Occupied Areas would have no departments. This grading system could be changed at any time based on the degree to which government orders were implemented, in order to create a flexible system and reduce difficulties in manpower and resources.</p>
<p>Returning Refugees - Land to the Tiller</p>
<p>According to investigations, the number of refugees from Shandong who have fled to the areas controlled by provincial troops within the province is 7,857,000, while 1,813,000 are in the Nanjing and Xuzhou areas outside the province. The total number accounts for more than one-quarter of the province's total population. To address this, Wang Yaowu has requested and received 3 billion in relief funds from the central government for distribution and has arranged for the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) to allocate materials for distribution to various regions. He is also assisting in organizing self-aware, self-motivated, and self-governing homecoming corps, applying to the central government for agricultural loans, and requesting raw materials, fertilizers, small agricultural tools, and other production tools, funds, and weapons. With production tools, they can become self-reliant; with weapons, they can defend themselves. Such homecoming corps, possessing both production and self-defense organizations, can not only form a kind of mobile production group, gradually moving back to their hometowns, but can also, when necessary, still move out again in an armed and planned manner, avoiding sacrifices, until the area is stable before returning.</p>
<p>Returning to their hometowns, the people are absolutely prohibited from retaliating against those who remained behind when the Communist forces were in control. They are also implementing a substantial policy, expanding the unified construction movement. All land disputes will be resolved in accordance with central government laws, protecting tenant farmers, supporting owner-farmers, and earnestly implementing rent and interest reduction measures to realize land to the tiller. People's representative bodies at all levels below the county level will be established as soon as possible, and popular elections of township heads, chiefs, and county magistrates will be implemented step by step.</p>
<p>Guns Never Leave People - People Never Leave Their Homes</p>
<p>Regarding the rebuilding of local armed forces, it is necessary to specifically and particularly explain that in the early days of victory, Shandong Province, due to overly strict downsizing of local troops, overlooked the uniquely complex environment of Shandong. This inadvertently created an opportunity for the Communist forces. As a result, the government forces were cut back, the Communist forces expanded, and the central government troops, being too far away, could not provide timely assistance, leading to the current situation. Since assuming concurrent management of the province, Wang Yaowu has been steadily proceeding with the work of census taking, organizing baojia (collective responsibility system), and improving mass organizations in the recovered areas, especially in rebuilding local armed forces. In addition to reorganizing the provincial security regiments in accordance with central government regulations, self-defense forces will be established in the special commissioner areas according to actual needs. In the southwestern Shandong areas, the original large and small peasant associations will be organized into eight corps. In addition to police detachments, each county will have a self-defense battalion, each district a self-defense company, and each township a self-defense platoon. The organizational principles for each unit emphasize "guns never leave people, people never leave their homes, and non-separation from production" to strengthen the self-defense organization and training of counties, districts, townships, and baojia.</p>
<p>Increase Production - Stabilize Life</p>
<p>In terms of economic construction, in order to stabilize the people's lives, in addition to restoring farming, attention is also being paid to promoting special economic crops. Shandong's cotton production was second only to Shaanxi. This year, there was a plan to promote one million mu of cotton fields along the Jiaoji Railway and in southwestern Shandong, but it could not be fully completed due to military reasons. Regarding the plan to promote American tobacco varieties, the Provincial Department of Construction, Shandong University, and the North China Extension and Breeding Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry jointly established a breeding farm at the Chengyang Farm in Qingdao this year. Next year, it will be able to obtain enough American tobacco seeds to plant 50,000 mu. Other projects, such as straw braid, handmade cloth weaving, and the development of coal and iron production in Zaozhuang, Yixian, Laiwu, and Xintai, are also progressing steadily. In particular, Shandong Province has the largest reserve of gypsum in the country, accounting for the first place nationwide. As long as military operations progress, the future prospects are unlimited. In addition, utilizing relief materials for work-for-relief projects, carrying out the Grand Canal water conservancy irrigation project, and fully repairing highways and restoring transportation as military operations progress will closely coordinate with the needs of the National Army.</p>
<p>Consolidate Finances - Strictly Prohibit Apportionment</p>
<p>County-level finance is the key to relieving the people's suffering and competing with the Communist Party for the hearts of the people. If this point cannot be done well, or is not done well enough, all efforts will be in vain. Therefore, since Wang Yaowu assumed concurrent management of Shandong Province, he has determined the steps for clearing up finances based on the extent to which government orders are implemented in each county, approved expenses according to the new county-district grading system, and issued them on time without delay, sweeping away past malpractices to restore the provincial government's credibility. On the one hand, legal taxes are levied and tax sources are broadened; on the other hand, unified planning methods are used to implement reasonable burdens and thoroughly eliminate extra apportionment. Regarding the self-defense expenses of counties and cities, it is stipulated that the Unified Planning Committee will uniformly manage and disburse them. Although only four months have passed since its rigorous implementation, it has already achieved great results.</p>
<p>Over the years, after Shandong was split and divided by Communist Party occupation, the old social organization has completely disintegrated. Not only has politics disintegrated, but also the economy, society, and even culture have disintegrated. Since Wang Yaowu assumed concurrent management of Shandong Province, he has deeply understood that military affairs are only a temporary solution. The fundamental way to cure the problem lies in political construction and a highly developed political offensive, and the foundation of politics lies in the reconstruction of a new social organization. We have witnessed that the people of Shandong in the recovered areas have gradually been able to move from displacement to stability, from stability to progress, from being able to live to living a better life, and from being able to defend themselves to being able to govern themselves. Under the leadership of Wang Yaowu, overcoming all difficulties, they are gradually moving towards a new Shandong based on the Three Principles of the People: of the people, by the people, and for the people. This, on the other hand, also demonstrates that the Communist Party's policies of "liquidation," "struggle," and "overturning" are incompatible with the national character of the Chinese people and will inevitably encounter historically unavoidable failure.</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Qingdao Base</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Qingdao via Air, Fourth Day - From Our Special Correspondent, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>The Qingdao base holds inestimable significance for a strong navy.</p>
<p>The Chinese navy currently has more than 70,000 tons of ships. If distributed among the four planned naval bases in Qingdao, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Hainan Island, each base could berth less than 20,000 tons of ships. In the near future, more than 30,000 tons can be received from Japan. As for the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, its strength is uncertain. U.S. warships entering and leaving Qingdao naval port do not have procedures to notify the Chinese authorities. Generally speaking, Chinese officials in Qingdao are not clear about this matter.</p>
<p>In fact, the commander of the Chinese Qingdao base was only recently appointed, and Colonel Dong Muzeng has not yet taken office. The Northern Patrol Fleet of the Chinese fleet stationed in Qingdao receives oil from the U.S. military warehouses, with bills drawn and accounts kept, which the government will settle. A small ship of less than a thousand tons requires at least 1,500 gallons of diesel fuel for 24 hours of sailing (my estimate). Even when stationary, running a generator requires at least 100 gallons of diesel fuel per day. Supplying the navy is not the same as feeding an infant. Because essentially these ships are not built in Chinese shipyards, their situation is no different from that of the air force.</p>
<p>If the Qingdao base is viewed in isolation, it possesses the elements of a good port. There is heavy fog in May, June, and July, most severely in July, like London, where it is impossible to see even a short distance. However, it dissipates before 8:00 AM and is not so serious as to require daytime lighting for vehicles. Under current military equipment conditions, it will not be a problem. Military experts worldwide consider it to be one of the world's foremost naval ports. Its transition from German to Japanese to the current situation may serve as one of the examples for geopolitics scholars.</p>
<p>Two Powers Confront - Broad Implications</p>
<p>If viewed in conjunction with other factors, the problem is undoubtedly complex, but the true value can be revealed. It and Lushun/Dalian are separated by the Shandong Peninsula and the Bohai Sea Bay, facing each other from afar. The range of fighter jets is less than one hour. The Shandong Peninsula is under the control of the Communist armed forces, while the Liaodong Peninsula is in a state of intertwined control by the Nationalists and Communists. Coupled with the presence of Soviet and American forces, there is a hidden confrontation between two different forces in the world. The phenomena occurring around the Bohai Sea, between 35 and 40 degrees north latitude, are of serious concern to China and the world. The issues that arise are enough to stimulate China and the world because they are too concrete and extensive.</p>
<p>Connected to Sasebo in a Line</p>
<p>Qingdao and Sasebo can be connected in a line, forming a triangular zone with Shanghai on the Yellow Sea. The entire Yellow Sea is within the 12-hour sailing range of cruisers. This is like a tight net that holds the entire Yellow Sea. But Qingdao is a hub. Without the Qingdao base, Shanghai could be connected to Sasebo in a line, which would be equivalent to completely withdrawing from the Yellow Sea. Therefore, Qingdao has become a symbol of the Yellow Sea.</p>
<p>American Advisors - Not Paid Salaries</p>
<p>The United States "established a base in Qingdao to train the Chinese Navy." There are 70 American advisors at the naval academy. The Chinese government does not pay their salaries. They specialize in training the Chinese Navy to receive American ships. Colonel Wei Jimin, the director of education, said that there is a lot of American teaching equipment, and just the installation alone puts a great strain on our finances. The training level is generally based on being able to completely control the ships as a preliminary standard. The Chinese Navy is receiving warships from the Americans, but there is "no fixed curriculum." Students at the naval academy in Shanghai are still arriving in Qingdao. It is expected that all 158 students will arrive by the middle of this month. Twelve ships are waiting to be delivered to the Chinese Navy. In the past, Qingdao has received 36 ships, while Shanghai has received 50 ships. Including the 12 ships, the total number is still less than 100, totaling about 70,000 tons. The pre-war figure of more than 100,000 tons for the Chinese Navy must be supplemented by receiving more than 30,000 tons of Japanese ships. Only then can it be called "restoration" of the naval numbers.</p>
<p>Russian-Speaking Residents - Continue to Increase</p>
<p>Through TASS reports, the Soviet Union is showing serious attention to Qingdao. On the other hand, among the foreigners in Qingdao, the largest number is Soviet and quasi-Soviet (White Russians, who can become Soviet citizens at any time). There are about more than 1,000 people. They are almost equal to the total number of foreigners of 38 other nationalities (including Jews). They increase with the increase in the U.S. Marines. The occupations they hold are the same as those in general capitalist countries. Although there is a serious "housing shortage" in Qingdao, the number of Russian-speaking friends continues to increase.</p>
<p>Radar Emissions - Military Depots Rumble</p>
<p>From the seaside docks, radar emitters on several large buildings can be seen rotating in the sky from afar. U.S. military vehicles rumble incessantly on the roads, while the latest model sedans are mostly owned by Chinese. At the Qingdao City Council, a councilor questioned the mayor, saying, "The U.S. military has been stationed in Qingdao for a year and eight months, but more than 400 citizens have died at the hands of U.S. soldiers or under their vehicles. I hope the city government can find a solution." The mayor said, "There have been more than 200 cases of U.S. military personnel injuring people. Every case has been negotiated, and more than two-thirds have been resolved, while one-third is still under investigation." The questioning took place when Shandong University on Daxue Road was in a mess. This day was "June 2nd." This day was a full-blown fight.</p>
<p>Swimming Beaches - Scheduled to Open</p>
<p>Qingdao has wind blowing every day, shaking the windows, as if foreshadowing what might happen. U.S. sailors walk on the streets, and Chinese naval personnel also walk on the streets, especially whole teams of naval students, dressed so neatly, with the vast and beautiful sea as their background, giving one a sense of inexplicable excitement, and also a feeling of the significance of Qingdao.</p>
<p>High summer is coming, and every small contact on the periphery can be thrilling, but this year's swimming beaches are still as beautiful as ever. The painted bathing sheds, competing for novelty and ingenuity, require much effort. They are scheduled to open formally on the 15th, and I will have the opportunity to describe them to readers. We have such good bathing beaches, we can really be proud.</p>
<h3>The Temple of Confucius - The Confucian Forest</h3>
<p>— Quick Dispatch from Qufu, One Day</p>
<p>The current county town of Qufu was once the capital of the Lu state in ancient times, and also the hometown of sages and virtuous men. Every year during the spring and autumn seasons, the number of visitors is very large. Recently, with the restoration of railway transportation, there has been a gradual stream of visitors.</p>
<p>The name "Qufu" comes from the mound (fu) to the west of Fangshan Mountain in the east of the city, which meanders for seven or eight li.</p>
<p>The Temple of Confucius is located in the city, slightly west of Confucius' old residence. Its main hall, the Dacheng Hall, has nine rooms, is seven zhang eight chi six cun high, fourteen zhang two chi seven cun wide, and eight zhang four chi deep. The front pillars, to the right, are all coiled dragons. Beside and behind the eaves are stone pillars engraved with flowers, and the tiles are covered with yellow. In front is a platform, surrounded by stone railings, with two levels, and twelve steps on the middle steps and on the left and right. (See Figures 1 to 4 for a panoramic view of the Temple of Confucius.)</p>
<p>The Confucian Forest is located three li north of the county town, facing the Zhu River and backing the Si River. The Historical Records says: Confucius was buried north of the city of Lu, on the banks of the Si River. The tomb is like a horse's back, one zhang five chi high, and ten steps wide from north to south. There are two stone tablets in front of the tomb: one is the old tablet from the Xuanhe year of the Song Dynasty, and the other was erected by Yan Sheng Gong Chan Jin during the Zhengtong period of the Ming Dynasty. To its southwest is a three-room chamber, the burial place of Zigong. (See the panoramic view of the Confucian Forest above and below.)</p>
<p>Ancient cypress trees stand densely and solemnly beside it. At first, the forest was only one qing, and then it was expanded to twenty-nine qing, then to forty mu and nine fen. The circumference is more than ten li. Since Confucius, all members of the Kong family have been buried outside the walls of the saint's tomb, within the walls of the forest. This is what the ancients called family burial. (Special correspondent Zhang Yunzhi photographed and wrote this report.)</p>
<h3>Response to the Export of Taiwan Tea</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Taipei via Air, Second Day - Our Correspondent, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Among the cultivated land in Taiwan, the area for tea production ranks fourth, only after rice, sweet potatoes, and sugarcane. For more than 50 years during the Japanese occupation, the rise and fall of Taiwan tea had a closely related impact on the entire economy of Taiwan Province. During the peak period of Taiwan tea, the cultivated area was nearly 700,000 mu, and the output of refined tea was about 26 million catties. This was the result of the Japanese replacing manual labor with machines in a colonial manner for more than 20 years after occupying Taiwan. They actively exported and expanded foreign trade. At that time, in the world market, it was sufficient to compete with China and India. The hard work and sweat of the compatriots were exchanged for considerable profits for the Japanese. Until after the Pacific War, the U.S. sales of Taiwan tea were completely cut off. In the years 1944 and 1945, Taiwan tea suffered an unprecedented disaster. Tea factories stopped work, tea gardens were deserted, and tea farmers were unemployed. Now, when we talk about revival, it is truly an arduous task to revive everything from scratch.</p>
<p>If tea farmers have profits, manufacturers must also be guaranteed. Therefore, the Bank of Taiwan has now undertaken tea factory loans, with tea companies receiving 300 million yuan and private tea factories receiving 200 million yuan. With sufficient capital turnover, production will not be hindered. Last year, the total output of refined tea in the province was only 6 million pounds. This year, it is expected to reach 13 million pounds. If everything goes smoothly next year, it will not be difficult to match the pre-war annual output of more than 20 million pounds. The company itself can produce more than 4 million pounds of refined tea this year, accounting for one-third of the total output. One million pounds of raw materials are taken from its own tea gardens, and the remaining must be purchased from private tea gardens. The company plans to further establish tea farmer cooperatives and encourage tea factory production in the future. After the establishment of the Agricultural and Forestry Enterprise Co., Ltd., the tea company also launched the work of raising private shares and preferred shares. This is not competing with the people for profit, but rather sharing profits with the people. The company's income is the government's income, and this income is still invested in the tea industry. To ensure that Taiwan tea has a future, there must be no barriers in between. Only through everyone's cooperation, and with the company not regarding private workshops as competitors, but mainly striving for the international market to earn foreign exchange for the country. When the reporter asked Mr. Tao, the Chief of General Affairs of the former Tea Bureau Company, about the export situation of Taiwan tea, he told me quite frankly that only Formosa Oolong tea can show off a bit in the American market. Although the profit margin is small, it must be maintained in any case; otherwise, if Americans forget the taste of Formosa Oolong tea, it will be difficult to open the market again. The Taiwan tea export began with a batch of 400,000 pounds sold to the New York branch of the China Trust Company at the end of last year. It was not until May of this year that more than 180,000 U.S. dollars of foreign exchange was settled at the official price of 11.85 yuan, at a rate of 45 cents per pound. The response was: the size of the samples matched; there were no impurities; and the aroma was standard enough. Therefore, another batch of 7,000 boxes was shipped to the American branch of the Bank of China yesterday. The China Trust Company has announced a price of 44 cents per pound, but hopes that someone will offer a higher price.</p>
<p>Looking at the tea company's accounts from last year, it seems that some money was made by selling the accumulated raw materials at market prices, but it is not so simple to replenish them. Therefore, maintaining quality, grasping sales channels, and opening up markets are important, and the tea company becomes a pioneer. It is said that many tea merchants can deceive the inspectors and mix old tea for re-processing and export. The impact of this is unthinkable. When the harm is felt, the entire Taiwan tea industry will collapse. The reporter often hears the call to "take a long-term view and act with conscience." Thinking of the future of Taiwan tea, this call is loud enough to be deafening and shocking!</p>
<p>Currently, the tea company is seeking solutions to the following difficulties: (1) the restoration of tea gardens, (2) the impact of commodity prices on production costs, (3) the replenishment of materials, (4) the instability of tea farmers' lives, and (5) the inability of Taiwanese compatriots to understand the government's tea industry policy. These problems are mostly related and interdependent. Therefore, to prevent the shakeup of the entire Taiwan tea enterprise, from production in the tea garden to loading for export, there needs to be a comprehensive plan that takes care of everything from start to finish, and a definite and unwavering fixed direction. The tea company has unlimited optimism about this.</p>

<h3>On the Right Path to Nation-Building</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Currently, the aspiration of the people throughout the country lies in seeking domestic peace, political democracy, and economic construction. This is to implement the Three Principles of the People as the "constant path to saving and building the nation." If domestic peace is absent and wars continue endlessly, internal strife will inevitably invite external aggression. As a result, the final victory obtained through eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, at the cost of the lives and property of tens of millions of compatriots, and the glory of being ranked among the five great powers, is now almost subject to the humiliating disgrace of being discussed as a problem at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers due to years of war and the disappointment of peace! If various parties, factions, and people throughout the country do not prioritize the nation and its people above all else and quickly follow the path of peaceful nation-building to resolve their own problems, they will inevitably plunge the nation and its people into an irredeemable abyss, becoming the subject of international conferences for discussion and disposition. The blood of revolutionary martyrs and those who fought in the War of Resistance will be shed in vain, and the nation's independence and people's freedom will inevitably be lost again! Therefore, at the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Central Committee, President Chiang Kai-shek earnestly encouraged everyone to "gather patriotic and ambitious individuals from across the country to fight together," and instructed, "On the eve of the implementation of constitutional governance, we should cultivate the magnanimity of our party members and interact sincerely with other parties." If we can follow President Chiang's instructions, sincerely cooperate with other parties, work together harmoniously, tolerate each other for the sake of the country, and embark on the path of peaceful nation-building to eliminate international interference, strive for national freedom, and realize the ideals of nationalism, this is the primary task of revolutionary nation-building today, which should be carefully considered and rationally resolved.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang is the oldest and largest party in Chinese history, and it is undeniable that there are many shortcomings and inertia within the party. Since the Kuomintang came to power, many party members have been able to be public-spirited and law-abiding, working for the country and the people. However, there are also many selfish and self-serving corrupt officials who rely on their party membership to engage in corruption and seek promotion and wealth. Once officials become corrupt, politics become inefficient and ineffective. Therefore, to improve political efficiency, corruption must be eradicated; to eradicate corruption, governments at all levels must make economic, administrative, and personnel matters public. Governments in all democratic countries have an obligation to publish financial budgets and final accounts to the public. Not only should financial figures be published, but other figures should also be published as much as possible. Not only should figures be published, but all economic measures should also be easily understood by the people and should not contain elements of concealment or even deception. Before any administrative measures are decided, they should always be publicly announced and even widely publicized to allow the people to understand the true situation. The promotion and demotion of government officials should be fair and selfless, prioritizing the country over the party, selecting the virtuous and capable, conducting regular assessments, and publicly rewarding and punishing them. Only by making everything public can we achieve impartiality, eradicate corrupt officials, build a clean and efficient government, increase administrative efficiency, implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and move towards the path of democratic constitutionalism. Democratic countries emphasize protecting the rights of the people, so it is necessary to ensure the freedom of the people in terms of body, thought, religion, belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, movement, and communication. Existing laws and regulations that conflict with the above principles should be amended or repealed accordingly. In particular, it is necessary to strictly prohibit any agency or individual other than judicial and police organs from engaging in the arrest, interrogation, and punishment of the people. Democratic politics is a politics that reflects public opinion, promotes the rule of law, and implements governance by the people. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and universally establish provincial, county (city) councils, and public opinion organs below the county level to express public opinion, ensure the unity and independence of judicial power, free from political interference, strengthen court personnel, improve their treatment and status, uphold their sacred duty of enforcing the law impartially, and promote the supervisory system to severely punish corruption, so that the whole country follows the law, and to promote the rule of law; actively promote the new county system, complete local autonomy, and realize governance by the people. From now on, Kuomintang members should particularly respect public opinion, abide by laws and regulations, promote autonomy, and move towards the path of democratic constitutionalism. Young party members with ambition, talent, and integrity should go deep into the grassroots, become sound rural autonomous officials or rural elementary school teachers, faithfully serve the people, and cultivate healthy seedlings for the nation. It would be even better if they could go deep into the border areas, become border reclamation members, and devote themselves to border construction to consolidate national defense. These are all new trends and styles that the party headquarters and party members should adopt at present. As for improving the composition and quality of party members, we should focus on the education of party members and the cultivation of a spirit of self-examination, self-criticism, and self-improvement. The goal is to continuously improve the standards of health, morality, knowledge, and ability, and to enhance the spirit of service to build the country and create happiness for the people. To train the people to exercise their four powers, to instill political common sense in the people, so that the people of the whole country can truly use their own strength to manage their own affairs, to achieve true "returning power to the people," and to embark on the bright path of true democratic constitutionalism, and to realize the ideals of civil rights, is the constant path that should be followed in saving and building the nation today.</p>
<p>Today, the people are suffering from poverty and disease, and their lives are unbearable. Therefore, to carry out revolutionary nation-building, we must earnestly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, improve the people's lives, pay attention to the problem of nourishing the people, and seek sufficient food and clothing to enrich the people and the country. The method of implementation should follow the "Industrial Plan," formulate an economic construction plan, welcome international capital and technological cooperation, and prioritize both industry and mining, and agriculture and commerce. To promote China's industrialization, the government should convene a national economic conference on a regular basis, inviting people from all sectors of society related to the development of economic construction to absorb public opinions and decide on government measures. Large-scale industries that are monopolistic and cannot be run by private capital should be classified as state-owned or publicly owned, such as railways, machinery manufacturing plants, and electrical undertakings, which should be run by the government. Other smaller-scale industries should be given incentives by formulating incentive regulations and be subject to government guidance and supervision to achieve the goal of regulating capital. Similarly, for the exploitation of mineral products, in addition to a part stipulated to be operated by the state, we should also vigorously encourage private exploitation, because more mining means more power for nation-building. In this way, while exploiting mineral resources and establishing the foundation of heavy industry, and encouraging the operation of light industry, we must also develop and improve local handicrafts. As for the types of handicraft products, we must select those with huge needs and first try to rush production. The government should pay special attention to supporting this type of industry and promoting its success, so that it can be self-sufficient. If there are still some domestic raw materials that are not available, we can conduct research to imitate or use other similar substitutes, so as to minimize the use of foreign goods as the first priority. For large machines and industrial supplies, except for those that China cannot currently manufacture by itself, which can be purchased abroad, ordinary parts can be manufactured by ourselves. The general principle is to create by self-reliance and use domestic products as much as possible, so as to develop resources, reduce imports, and balance foreign exchange. In addition, attention should be paid to the suitability of transportation and geographical environment in the selection of industrial locations, because if transportation is inconvenient and transportation is blocked, it will prevent the balance of supply and demand, and it will also be uneconomical in terms of time and economy. Other measures include the implementation of labor laws, the improvement of working conditions, the trial implementation of the labor dividend system, the establishment of unemployment insurance and disability insurance for workers, the effective protection of child labor and female labor, the formulation of industrial association laws to enable industrial operators to have separate organizations, and the improvement of factory management regulations to promote labor-management cooperation. Widely establish workers' night schools, technical schools, and industrial and mining research institutions to improve workers' cultural standards and promote industrial and mining construction. Encourage scientific research and invention, and catch up with the material civilization of Europe and the United States. These are all necessary measures to promote national industrialization. As for agriculture, it is necessary to implement rent reduction and interest reduction, protect tenant rights, guarantee rent payment, expand agricultural loans, strictly prohibit usury exploitation to improve the lives of farmers, and implement land law to achieve the goal of "farmers have their own land." We should also reclaim national wasteland, develop farmland water conservancy, develop farmers' organizations, promote collective farms, implement a warehousing system, establish agricultural financial institutions, encourage rural cooperative undertakings, pay attention to scientific experiments, promote agricultural extension, and engage in agricultural product processing to promote the industrialization of agriculture. The export of agricultural products in our country is mainly tea, silk, tung oil, etc., so tea leaves, silkworm seeds, and tung seedlings must be improved in quality to meet inspection standards, so that international trade can flourish and exchange for a large amount of foreign exchange. Other measures include consolidating the legal currency, stabilizing prices, reforming the tax system, eradicating excessive taxes and illegal apportionments, merging collection agencies, simplifying audit procedures, determining progressive tax rates based on assets and income, promoting specialized methods of national banks, supporting the development of industrial and agricultural undertakings, implementing protective tariff policies, and managing the import and export of goods. Promoting our country's international trade, raising funds for the demobilization and employment of soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance, guaranteeing the lives of disabled veterans, providing pensions and education for the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance, confiscating all enemy and puppet property in the recovered areas, providing relief to displaced refugees and overseas Chinese, and assisting their repatriation and resumption of business are all urgent economic priorities, and are the constant path to saving the poor and becoming rich, implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood, and saving and building the nation.</p>
<p>The health of the people is the driving force for saving and building the nation, and it is the most valuable resource of the nation and the people. Therefore, Americans regard health as the first thing to do to love the country, and the British also have the saying that "a nation with third-class physique cannot create a first-class country." Westerners often regard health as wealth, and the Soviet Union's revolutionary nation-building, which especially emphasizes hygiene and strives to strengthen the people, is the most recent and best example for reference. Therefore, to build a rich, strong, healthy and happy new China, we must strive to strengthen the people and strengthen the species. To strengthen the people and strengthen the species, we must also pay attention to the "education" and "happiness" of the people. This is why the Principle of People's Livelihood, in addition to discussing the four major issues of food, clothing, housing and transportation, also has the two major issues of "education" and "happiness." Although these two issues have not been discussed in the Principle of People's Livelihood, according to the author's humble opinion, the meaning of "education" is to ensure that the people of the whole country have full development in both body and mind, and special attention should be paid to the two causes of "hygiene" and "education."</p>
<p>In terms of hygiene, it is necessary to popularize medical and health facilities, such as the widespread establishment of various specialized hospitals, provincial, municipal, and county hospitals, health centers, health branches, health stations, health workers, etc., as well as the large-scale establishment of various health institutions such as hygiene materials factories, pharmaceutical factories, blood serum vaccine factories, hygiene experiment institutes, and hygiene training institutes, to complete the construction of a hygiene network, and implement public medicine and public drugs, so that the whole people can receive free medical treatment to promote national health. However, medical and health care is only for treating and preventing diseases, while exercise is for strengthening the body and removing diseases. Therefore, if we want to promote national health, we must popularize national fitness exercises, such as widely organizing sports groups, widely establishing sports venues and enriching their equipment, and encouraging various sports competitions.</p>
<p>We should also spread the exercise methods suitable for each person's body, so as to increase the interest of the whole people in sports and promote their health. However, some people, because their parents and ancestors have hereditary diseases, may get this hereditary disease during pregnancy or after childbirth. If we want to reduce them, or even eliminate them completely, then we must implement the national eugenics policy. The method should be that the government should set up marriage authorities, promulgate various laws and regulations to encourage the reproduction of superior species, and stipulate that both parties to the marriage must exchange health certificates to encourage the reproduction of superior species and prevent the inheritance of inferior species. However, healthy children who are born will definitely become unhealthy after a while if they do not have good living habits and exercise methods, so we must actively promote health education, such as instilling health knowledge, training hygiene habits, managing the hygiene environment, implementing school hygiene, and paying attention to mental health. The health of a person! Whether innate or acquired, is closely related to the family, because the family is the place to raise children and educate children, and it is also the cell of the social country, so we must improve the family to build a sound society, such as implementing maternal and child hygiene, and improving family environmental hygiene and food, clothing, housing management, etc. Various places should also widely establish nurseries, kindergartens, youth and infant hospitals, and children's welfare homes to implement children's welfare and education. And enable working women to foster their children when they work, so as to reduce their responsibility for raising children and increase their effectiveness in serving the community. These are all constant paths that should be followed in protecting healthy children and people.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Life and Death of Yu Dafu</h3>
<p>— Mengnong</p>
<p>The weather is undergoing drastic changes. This really doesn't seem like early summer. As evening approaches, a musty air appears. Outside the window, the lush green but slightly yellowed elm leaves fall from time to time with the wind, making a rustling, monotonous sound. I silently closed the "Complete Works of Yu Dafu" in my hand, and in a dreamlike state, I silently reminisced about this respectable and mournful literary giant!</p>
<p>Yu Dafu's life is over. He was tragically murdered in the autumn wind of August two years ago, just like the elm leaves falling in the torrential rain outside the window, and it seemed that he didn't even make a rustling, weak cry! Andreyev said: "People who come from the darkness and return to the darkness are sucked into the infinite void of time, and no trace remains." Could he have become one of the people Andreyev referred to as "no trace remains"? Perhaps this is the common fate of literary figures of that era.</p>
<p>Yu Dafu's life is a great tragedy, and also an epic of heroism. His works, his art—art that entrusted his own life, are unfolding before my eyes, giving me encouragement, giving any young person new inspiration. Therefore, I can better understand the true meaning of Andreyev's warning-like maxim, because I really can't help but sigh and grieve for those people who are submerged by time. Perhaps they had valuable thoughts and feelings, but unfortunately they all disappeared from the ticking of time, and fell like elm leaves in iron rain without a trace. They could not or were unwilling to leave any traces.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yu Dafu, in his thirties, compiled his own "Complete Works," collecting his main works before the age of thirty. He didn't seem to value the past very much, but he didn't deny it either. He called his entire works "cold ashes," "worn-out shoes," "chicken ribs," "broken remnants," and "fern vegetables." At the same time, he lamented the present and forever placed his hopes on the future.</p>
<p>His past was an endless wandering. In the second year of the Xuantong reign, he wandered from his hometown of Fuyang to Hangzhou, where he studied at the First Middle School. He always went to Meihua Stele, where there were many local bookstores, to take a walk. At that time, he loved to read the two books "Tales of West Lake" and "Traces of Flowers and the Moon." Two years later, the revolutionary army rose up, and the provincial schools were suspended due to the current situation. He changed to a church school, but he still loved to read the talented scholars and beautiful women's dramas "The Peach Blossom Fan" and "The Swallow Letter." That year he was only seventeen years old. In September, he went to Japan and worked hard. The next spring, he entered Tokyo High School. From then on, he came into contact with Western masterpieces. From Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gorky, Chekhov, to writers from Germany, England, Japan, and France. According to him, he read about 1,000 masterpieces in four years. Later, he entered the Department of Economics at Tokyo Imperial University, but he still loved literature. This is how his creative life unfolded—his first work, "Sinking," expressed a romance of his study abroad days. Later, although on the one hand he was criticized as "garbage" and "wounds," on the other hand he was loved by readers.</p>
<p>He returned to China in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, but he could not find a job. He began to write novels and joined the Creation Society. The following year, he was hired by Peking University as a professor. In the twenty-fourth year, he was a professor at Wuchang University, and a year later he returned to Shanghai. Since then, he went south to Guangzhou and north to Jinghua, and his journey was hurried, with almost no peaceful days. Although he had published some works in the meantime, he himself said that "he had never sat down to do great things."</p>
<p>His years entered China in wandering uncertainty. He hoped to end his past unstable life. He had longed for the pleasure of indifference and tranquility many times: "I don't need brocade clothes, and I'm content with wild vegetables, but the house to live in, the car to travel in, or at least a pair of shoes and socks, must be there before I can speak." ("Notes on the Thatched Cottage in the Wind and Rain") He also said: "My nature of traveling and liking to stay overnight has gradually decreased in recent years;" he "only wants to not change his usual state, eat some exquisite dishes at home, drink some fragrant wine, take a nap, and read some leisurely books, and is unwilling to move his actions and peacetime - in short, he is too lazy to move."</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance broke out, his life not only could not be as stable as he had hoped, but became even more bumpy. He detoured into Fujian and served as an official for a period of time, and then went to Nanyang to run a newspaper. When the Pacific War broke out, he left Singapore in February of the following year and fled to Selat Panjang, Pengkalan Island, on Sumatra Island. He changed his name to "Zhang Deqing" and made a living by doing small business. The violence and terror of the Japanese soldiers became more and more intense every day, so he decided to escape to the western part of Sumatra Island - Paya Kumbuh. At this time, he used the alias "Zhao Lian" and in September of the thirty-first year, he raised a little capital and opened the "Zhao Lian Winery." The purpose was to use this as a cover and solve the lives of some poor friends who were fleeing. But this way of life could not be concealed from the Japanese for long. The Japanese military police may have already known that he was Yu Dafu, and using the excuse that this "Zhao Lian" could speak fluent Japanese, they ostensibly asked him to be an interpreter for the military police department, but in reality, they placed him under house arrest and surveillance. He was forced to serve as an interpreter. Although he was unwilling, he had no choice. It was not until February of the following year that he resigned from the position of interpreter for the military police department, claiming to be ill (lung disease). During this period, he did help a lot in rescuing overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrendered, Yu Dafu encountered an even more unfortunate accident. I don't know if this was his misfortune or his good fortune. On August 29 (the Central News Agency telegram said August 28, but it is not known which is correct), he was suddenly arrested by the Japanese army and "executed by shooting at the same time as several Europeans. His tomb is located seven kilometers from the Fort de Kock." Indeed, Yu Dafu knew the atrocities, secrets and intelligence of the Japanese army well in Sumatra for four years. How could the Japanese army let him go? If they left him, wouldn't they be leaving a living witness? Yu Dafu's tragic death was of course inevitable. Yu Dafu may not have been unaware of this conspiracy of the Japanese. But at the same time, he also knew the way to give up his life for righteousness. Where righteousness lies, death is not a resignation. This death at least proves that he is not drifting along with a group of vulgar people, but on the contrary, it shows that he is after all "a modern Lu You who is full of vicissitudes and cares about his family and country!"</p>
<p>The story has to be told again: If he had not been sacrificed under the iron hooves of the Japanese army, he would only be fifty years old this year. He would definitely be able to gather his remaining courage and write a powerful work or even many powerful works to strongly accuse the Japanese army. However, now, what else can be left besides this "Complete Works of Yu Dafu" that he wrote early in his life as a will? No, no, a thousand no's! Thinking like this, his complete works are his monument. At least in my opinion, it is worth remembering, worth stroking, and worth embracing!</p>
<p>The closed "Complete Works of Yu Dafu" was finally opened again. The elm leaves outside the window are still fluttering in the wind and rain. Accompanying it is the ticking of the clock on the wall.</p>
<p>It was ticking like this in the past, it is ticking like this now, and it will still be ticking like this in the future. Some writers have disappeared, some writers have emerged, and Yu Dafu is immortal. He was brave and intelligent. He used his life and career to fill this short, gloomy, and empty time. He chose the path of self-sacrifice. He has completed the tortuous and varied path of a writer. Rest in peace, farewell, our poet and novelist!</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Dafu has already established an undeniable achievement in the Chinese New Culture Movement. In terms of novella and short story creation, Mr. Yu Dafu has also given us many new forms and techniques. He has the demeanor of an Eastern literary figure, the passion of a Western writer, chic and melancholy, respectable and lovely. This year is the third anniversary of his death and the fiftieth anniversary of his birth (his birthday is the fourth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar). This journal is now able to publish Mr. Menglong's introduction to his life and death. In the future, on the anniversary of his birth, we can also ask several friends who know Yu Dafu well to write a few more articles. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Ten Years</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tixuan</p>
<p>Ten years have passed in the central government, it seems like a moment. The capital city is contained in my heart, my sleeves are still as clean as the wind. By the Lion Bridge, I watch the moon above the tall buildings; by the Jiming Dike, I relive the spring in the small courtyard. I am still me, I still have my writing to serve the country; thirty or forty years old, please remember my youth. To show my relatives and friends, and to express my feelings of separation and reunion.</p>
<p>I have been entrusted with the important task of the central government for ten years, my official post is pure, and my hair has turned grey (Pan Yue was thirty-two years old when he first saw grey hair, and I am now four years older than him as a Yellow Gate official). Good news is waiting to be spread like the warbler singing from the valley, and the new residence is comparable to the phoenix moving its nest. I want to see the Stone Chamber and the Orchid Terrace, still the lofty palace of jade. It is still difficult to forget the country, when will I dream of county sabers on the roof beam?</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 529</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Are their two 'telegrams' the same?" I felt very interested.</p>
<p>"That's what's truly strange! ... After we carefully compared the two 'spiritual messages,' only the order of the items was different. The content was practically identical... That wouldn't be so special, but that old man, Juechang, in addition to noting the spiritual message, also attached two sentences. Looking at those two sentences, I was utterly shocked from my toes to the top of my head: it turned out that the old man even knew the results of our discussions here in advance! So the old man said, 'Elder Aoki's plan is not much different from the method you proposed, so you can proceed with confidence...' Isn't this a heap of strange things?..." (Tsurumi)</p>
<p>"I don't think it's strange at all!" I told Tsurumi, looking at his bewildered face.</p>
<p>"What?" Tsurumi asked, eyes wide.</p>
<p>"I ask you, do you know why Elder Aoki insisted that Heizi invite you to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"That's because Heizi can't handle the work of breaking the 'Secret of Eight,' only I can..."</p>
<p>"Here we go again!"</p>
<p>"I don't understand the meaning of what you're saying."</p>
<p>"It's very simple... Didn't you just say that the most important thing in Elder Aoki's 'spiritual message' was the 'numerical factor,' that he calculated that the date of August 1st was very auspicious for Japan's dispatch of troops? The Japanese, especially those military leaders, are extremely superstitious. Before planning to invade the mainland, they must have had astrologers calculate it; Elder Aoki wouldn't calculate it himself, but of course he would have news. So, he figured that only you could use your direct reports to Konoe about the news unfavorable to the Japanese dispatch of troops to prevent the launch of the 'Secret of Eight.' At least you could disturb them and miss the auspicious day they calculated..."</p>
<p>"Brother, the more you say, the more confused I become. Do you mean to say that Elder Aoki had already planned everything in advance, so this 'Secret of Eight' must have been broken in order to succeed?"</p>
<p>"That's right!"</p>
<p>"Brother, you're talking nonsense... I won't argue about anything else, just one thing. Elder Aoki, even if he had arranged everything properly, waiting for Heizi to invite me to carry it out. But I have to ask, such telegram reports, I could do them anywhere. Let's say those telegrams had to be sent from Shanghai and Nanjing. Zheng Yan in Shanghai and Tian Yiichi in Nanjing could also do it, as long as I sent a few more telegrams, right?"</p>
<p>"Do you think you're the only one who's awake in the world, and everyone else is a blockhead?" I explained, "Your actions, Heizi's actions, everything, Konoe is probably getting detailed reports. Elder Aoki has a detailed ledger of the mutual attacks of the three Mei, Lan, and Song special agent groups, your jealousy and my envy; then, he must have predicted that something would happen when you and Heizi came to Shanghai. Do you know that this time they troubled Heizi, they also wanted to catch you in the net, only because you and Heizi didn't understand the meaning of '0915,' that's why you luckily escaped the net—furthermore. Elder Aoki probably determined that something would happen as soon as you two arrived in Shanghai, and the occurrence of this incident itself could prove the internal discord of the Japanese army; just this kind of news of internal discord, once it reaches Konoe's ears, wouldn't it lightly warn him against rash action?..."</p>
<h3>Children's Drawings</h3>
<p>— Ji Guoping</p>
<p>The issue of children's drawings has gradually attracted the attention of the general public, especially those responsible for education, with the development of art education. Many scholars in foreign countries have done such research work, such as Legrange in France, Kerstienssteiner in Germany, and Kamezaburo Hino in Japan, all of whom have detailed studies. Schestel of Austria even organized a world-renowned children's art class to study children's drawing.</p>
<p>Children are happy and lively, and their love of art can be said to be an innate instinct. Therefore, when we see a child holding a pen to draw, they are always focused and concentrated, full of strong interest. But in fact, children's drawings are incomplete, disproportionate, unorganized, and uninformative. We cannot observe and criticize them with adult eyes. We need to know that children's drawings have their own realm, their own feelings, and their own views.</p>
<p>Children's drawings are sometimes intentional and sometimes unintentional. Because all healthy children like to scribble, chalk, charcoal, bricks, and tiles are their tools; the ground, walls, paper, and books are all places for them to express themselves. This is a kind of muscle movement and a pure expression of inner movement, which is never subject to any restraint or coercion, as if expressing themselves in words. The purpose of drawing is completely disregarded.</p>
<p>Generally, in the early stages of children's drawing, it is always out of imitative impulses. For example, when they see someone writing or drawing, they will definitely take a pen and scribble randomly. This is completely an imitative action; in addition to imitative actions, because of close association and similar association, drawing a horse leads to drawing a cow, and drawing a fish leads to drawing a shrimp. What's more, due to mechanical movements, drawing a circle leads to drawing many circles, drawing a line leads to drawing many lines; because of this, they can express many things by scribbling at will.</p>
<p>Children have the habit of preserving past impressions, that is, they like to draw things they have drawn before. Once they have drawn something, that impression is firmly remembered and does not change easily. For example, when drawing a landscape with two peaks and a sun in the middle, they will still draw the peaks and the sun unchanged when drawing a landscape after a long time. Their preservation of past impressions is an unconscious revelation, so we can know that they have a "internal impression" before drawing, so what they depict is a reproduction of external things that has been organized by their "internal impression".</p>
<p>Children's selection of drawing materials is also different from that of adults. For example, when drawing a house, they draw the upper half of the house, but not the lower half; when drawing a person, they draw the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth all at once, regardless of distance or size. This is a expression of what they consider important and what they consider unimportant, or what they consider cute and what they consider unlovely.</p>
<p>Therefore, children's drawings are a accumulation of many impressions of external objects and various internal activities, forming another kind of impression, a unique form of children's drawing.</p>
<h3>Casual Talks on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Kengqiang</p>
<p>Poetry is the lighthouse on the coast, it guides ships lost in the vast ocean, sailing into the bright and happy harbor.</p>
<p>Poetry is the kite in the sky, it can lead people's hopes to fly everywhere.</p>
<h3>Life Without Laughter</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingchun</p>
<p>As the beautiful sound, one of the special gifts of humankind, has almost vanished like citizens fleeing an air raid alert. We are enduring days without laughter. A normal human life is inevitably filled with laughter.</p>
<p>Laughter is precious. Have you ever calculated its benefits? It is the solvent of tangled disputes, a necessary gift for lovers, a safe investment for merchants, a catalyst for friendship, an introducer of happiness, a great tonic for health, a special effect cure for fatigue, and the most precious and rare thing is that the giver does not spend any real capital, while the receiver feels like they have received an eternally unforgettable favor.</p>
<p>The most beautiful things in the world must be the various forms of laughter, right? "Let me hold the baby," when you want to take that endearing infant from the hands of a healthy mother to caress, that baby has already responded with the most innocent and lovely smile.</p>
<p>The laughter of chivalrous heroes after revenge, on a night with a bright moon and high buildings, in a pot of murky wine, will be as majestic and shocking as spring thunder.</p>
<p>In the cold dusk, on a boundless journey, a traveler suddenly hears a few chuckles from some unknown girl. Like red apricots peeking out from beyond the wall, this small embellishment to the journey is enough to make the lonely traveler forget the pain of the trek.</p>
<p>In a village where the autumn harvest is over, have you ever seen the old farmers with wrinkled faces basking in the sun on piles of straw in front of the eaves? They are talking about ancient and modern absurd rumors as if they were true history, and when they get to the exciting parts, they let out a burst of "haha" laughter that is as simple as their lives.</p>
<p>No laughter is cheaper than that of middle school girls. Some say that the laughter of three of them together is worth three acres of rice paddies filled with the sound of frogs in April.</p>
<p>Who says that good flowers don't last long, that good dreams and good moons don't last long either? Haven't you seen the mysterious smile of the "Mona Lisa" painted by the artist Vinci? Isn't that a semi-open flower that never fades? A crescent moon that never sets? Light clouds that never dissipate? A good dream that never shatters? Guess, what is she smiling about?</p>
<p>The power of laughter is great beyond compare. A woman can control the degree of another person's sadness by adjusting the depth of her smile. Many people who are as calm as old monks, as hideous as fierce ghosts, as brave as the best in the army, and as wealthy as emperors, often wave the white flag and surrender unconditionally to the "dimples." Aren't those emperors who didn't hesitate to use beacon fires to deceive the feudal lords and throw away their thrones like worn-out shoes good examples?</p>
<p>Bad money drives out good money, and this law can also be applied to laughter. Those laughter worth savoring were all chased away by the "haha" of the bullies. What we can hear today are all morbid laughs, such as the terrifying sneer of the violent, the treacherous laughter of the insidious, the cold laughter, the flattering laughter of the shameless, the faint smile, the tragic laughter of the insulted and injured, the bitter laughter, and the hysterical laughter of various kinds of gamblers.</p>
<p>Knowing smiles, innocent smiles, and joyful laughter for no reason are gradually being eliminated, so we are living days without laughter.</p>
<p>The laughter of the twentieth century, like wealth, has also experienced a skewed phenomenon, as if someone is hoarding and speculating, monopolizing the market for laughter. The wider their smiles spread, the higher the cries of others become.</p>
<p>Look at the smug look of those with fat necks, their fleshy waves overflowing from their collars as they throw their heads back and laugh!</p>
<h3>Sitting in the Shade of Banana Trees</h3>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Thanks to the "Apology Delegation"</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Tetsu Katayama is singing the old tune of Sino-Japanese cooperation again, and even said that he wants to organize an "Apology Delegation" to apologize to China, "representing the Japanese people to apologize to the Chinese people for the looting behavior of the Japanese army in China." If we are not forgetful, when Prince Higashikuni was prime minister, there was also a similar plan, but it was not implemented because it was obstructed by the opposition at that time. The Japanese authorities, on the one hand, as a "defeated but not miserable" party, frequently send amorous glances to the victorious countries, saying things like "kindness is as heavy as the sky," "profound friendship," "benevolence and generosity," etc., flattering and smiling to praise the victory to the sky; on the other hand, they actively put forward plans, requesting the special privilege of immigrating to Taiwan, requesting joint administration of Ryukyu with the United States, requesting continued trusteeship of various small islands, requesting the production capacity of factories to reach a certain standard, requesting a security force of 100,000 troops... Obviously, Japan has its own wishful thinking. The dream of "rising again" is unforgettable for the Japanese people. To say a little further, please look at the imperial edict of the Japanese Emperor and the bulletin of the Suzuki cabinet at the time of surrender: they only mentioned the "Greater East Asia War" of nearly four years, but silently erased the great debt of blood that had been imposed on the Chinese people for eight years; to say a little closer, how many Japanese people, after shaking hands with you intimately, would casually say: "Japan did not launch any war of aggression!"</p>
<p>In their hearts is stubbornness and smirk, but on the outside they are doing their best to bow ninety degrees, which shows that the Japanese are in a delicate two extremes. They are doing their best to hope that others will be generous, so they have to do their best to suppress themselves.</p>
<p>What trick are they playing? Nothing else, to put it bluntly, they are on the one hand trying to rise up under the rule of the Allied countries; on the other hand, they are saying in their hearts: Let's fight again in ten years!</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation, the United States is accommodating Japan everywhere, sometimes even at the expense of China, which is very terrible. If Japan becomes the "watchdog of East Asia," it will not be a blessing for China, nor will it be a blessing for the world.</p>
<p>If the Chinese people still have a little self-awareness, I think the answer to the "Apology Delegation" that Japan is about to organize should be to ask them to put more effort into establishing a Japanese democratic government that loves peace, which is more meaningful than things like the "Apology Delegation."</p>
<h3>Drunk in the Spring Breeze</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>On June 1st, this newspaper reported that in this city, seven elementary school students, mistakenly believing in people's words, ran away from home, wanting to fly to the United States and enter the "Sino-American Junior Air Force School." At dusk, they got lost, stayed overnight in a hotel, were discovered by a volunteer police officer, and were taken back by their parents. Having lofty ambitions but being delusional, being young and ignorant, innocent minds not knowing the difficulties, often go astray! Vainly enlightened as immortals, wanting to be flying generals, young heroes are so ambitious!</p>
<p>University ideals are like high waves, diverging paths increase confusion, the long sky and thousands of miles, the wish is difficult to fulfill, regretting and sighing! Sadly opened doubts, dreams sunk hopes, the world is full of deception?</p>
<h3>May in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Mengping</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I returned to the countryside of Changzhou due to some business. After getting off the train, I heard that the departure time of the bus was uncertain, so I hired a bullock cart (single-key small cart) to go to the countryside. The carter bargained for the price to be calculated in rice, about one dou of rice for twenty li of road. It cost 30,000 yuan and included one meal.</p>
<p>Along the way, I saw that barley and wheat had already been harvested, and wheat was also waiting to be harvested. The tender green soybeans were about five inches long. Farmers and farm servants were weeding in the fields. Seven or eight-year-old and ten-year-old children herded cattle by the graves. The scene was quiet and peaceful, unlike the Shanghai people who worked hard for profit. The difference was like mud and clouds.</p>
<p>There were no student strikes or rice抢 (qiang) tides in the countryside. Everything was quiet. What there was was busy work (working for one day or several days) and how young and middle-aged men could avoid military service.</p>
<p>"There are few idle people in May in the countryside." In times of peace, there is a shortage of labor during the busy farming season in May.</p>
<p>Because of the shortage of labor, women began to participate in field work, which is similar to the situation in the villages near Shanghai, where men go to work in Shanghai and women till the fields. The daily wage for busy work is five jins of rice, which is 20,000 yuan, and includes meals. The price of wheat is less than 200,000 yuan per shi, which adds joy to the farmers.</p>
<p>"Grain is cheap and injures farmers." What farmers feel today is that when new grain or new rice is on the market, the price of wheat or grain is always particularly suitable, but when there is a shortage of grain, the price of wheat is expensive, and they are already as empty as the county magistrates, and some have to borrow money to survive.</p>
<p>Rural elementary schools are closed for busy farming, and teachers and students go home to help with the operations. This kind of vacation is more meaningful than ordinary summer vacations.</p>
<p>"May in the countryside" is the general mobilization period for agricultural producers, but unfortunately, agricultural technology lags behind and cannot cooperate with industry to improve the lives of farmers, let alone in today's world.</p>
<h3>The Rule of Law—Miscellaneous Notes on History—Part Eight—</h3>
<p>— Xiao Dai</p>
<p>In the nomadic era when the Chinese nation was initially formed, the ancestors were busy fighting against nature; until the slightly stable agricultural era, each person "dug wells to drink and tilled fields to eat." There was little contact with other tribes, and no economic relations occurred. Moreover, the social order at that time was not established, so no one would have thought of the so-called rule of law. As history slowly evolved, because of the mutual conquests of various tribes, it entered the economic relationship from the political field. Following the gradual development of the economy, living conditions also became superior. Therefore, the luxurious life corrupted the general aristocratic class and shook the rule of the hegemons.</p>
<p>When Guan Zhong assisted Qi, he saw that Qi's economic situation was more advanced than other countries, and urban life was also quite developed. Therefore, many of the state's nobles were corrupted. Taking Duke Huan of Qi as an example, he had three wives and six concubines. Guan Zhong wanted to save this decadent trend and set an example, so he advocated the adoption of the rule of law to Duke Huan of Qi. His proposition is made very clear in Guan Zi Ming Fa:</p>
<p>The enlightened ruler is one who measures the standards and adheres to them firmly, so orders are issued and the people follow. The law is the program of the world, and the instrument of all things. ... The enlightened ruler has a system of laws, so all the ministers come from the administration of rectitude and dare not commit adultery. The people know that the Lord is engaged in the law, so the officials are used in the law, then the people follow it, and there is no way to stop it. The people use the law to resist each other, and the lower people use the law to engage with the upper people. Therefore, those who are fraudulent cannot deceive their lords, those who are jealous cannot use their treacherous hearts, those who are flattering cannot use their skills, and those who are thousands of miles away do not dare to do wrong without permission. Therefore, the Ming Law says: "Those who have laws and regulations cannot be tricked with cunning and deception."</p>
<p>Also, Guan Zi Ren Fa says:</p>
<p>"The law is the supreme way of the world and the practical use of the holy ruler. ... There are those who create the law, and those who abide by the law; the one who creates the law is the ruler, the one who abides by the law is the minister, and the one who is in the law is the people. The rulers, ministers, superiors, inferiors, nobles, and inferiors all follow the law, which is called great governance."</p>
<p>The author has not found reliable records of the effect of Guan Zhong's advocacy of the law, so I dare not speculate, but from Shang Yang's rule of Qin and his advocacy of the rule of law, as well as the reduction of criminal law by the Han Dynasty, etc., it also has its own advantages.</p>
<p>But the problem also followed. Jia Yi's criticism of the Qin law said: "Putting the world in laws and criminal law, without any kindness, and resentment filling the world, the lower people hate it as an enemy."</p>
<p>From here we can see that it is the "people" who are "in the law" who suffer; and the so-called "ministers" who "abide by the law" not only do not "abide by the law" but also do not suffer, but instead play with the law there. Naturally, there is no need to talk about the "ruler" who "creates the law".</p>
<h3>Cost of Living</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>A: Do you know if there is a reliable formula for estimating the cost of living?</p>
<p>B: Yes. Take your income, no matter how much it is, and add one hundred percent, and you can get it.</p>
<h3>Relief and Poverty Alleviation</h3>
<p>— Chen Dexin</p>
<p>When I was a child, my teacher taught me a motto: "The best thing in life is to relieve the poor. Leftover rice and leftover food can also save people from hunger; old clothes and rags can also help people from the cold. Save one or two dishes from a banquet, save one or two gifts from generous gifts, buy one or two fewer sets of clothes, build one or two fewer houses, and buy one or two fewer pieces of furniture; save some surplus to help people in need. Getting rid of useless things can achieve great use; accumulating small favors can achieve great virtue." I think most people can do these things. Accumulating wealth is not as good as accumulating virtue, why not strive to do it?</p>
<h3>China Can't Build Cars</h3>
<p>— Zenghui</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, it was reported that during the discussion of the Senate on the collection of car municipal construction donations, there was the following debate:</p>
<p>"Zhou Xiang'sheng said, 'Business cars in foreign countries are not subject to donations.' Qu Yue retorted: 'Foreign countries can build their own cars, but China cannot build its own cars' (causing a burst of laughter)."</p>
<p>After reading these two sentences, I couldn't help but laugh and cry. The reason why it caused a burst of laughter was that Senator Qu's words were sharp and directed at Senator Zhou's words, but in fact, Senator Qu's words pointed out China's weaknesses and contained profound meaning.</p>
<p>If China could really build cars, not to mention not having to collect car construction donations, other exorbitant taxes and levies would definitely be reduced a lot, and China's economic crisis would not be so serious.</p>
<p>It is not that our country does not have the talent to build cars. This is a problem of the entire industry and economy. To build cars, we must first have excellent raw materials, from mining to smelting steel, building large-scale manufacturing plants, and hiring scientists to research and improve. Now we need huge funds. And in today's poor China, how can we talk about these? No wonder we collect several kinds of donations and taxes!</p>
<p>It is said that among the materials that Japan compensates our country, there will be a large number of town iron factories, machinery factories, and other heavy industrial equipment. I hope we can make good use of it, otherwise, in a few decades, China will still not be able to build cars.</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Circles</h3>
<p>The 23rd issue of Light Magazine, edited by Huang Jiayin, has been published in June. The content is wonderful. In addition to General Feng Yuxiang's "My Life in the War of Resistance" and Mr. Hai Ge's "Tianya", there are also Professor Yu Nanqiu's "Taiwan as I Saw It", Han Ye's "The Homecoming of Victory Refugees", Wei Bozhi's "The Desolate Longyan Iron Mine", and Ma Zhaoji's "Eastern Luther Master Taixu" and other articles.</p>

<h3>Visiting Mei Lanfang (4)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>However, what touched me the most at that time was not these trivial matters, but the feeling of the impermanence of life. He is older than me, and is fifty-six years old this year. No matter how good his health is, how many more years can he perform? God's handmade masterpiece, which is incomparably exquisite, must collapse and become ineffective in more than ten years; and this collapse is absolutely impossible to repair! Politicians can lay the foundation for eternity, so that they can live even after death; literary and artistic artists can pass on their works to future generations, so that life is short and art is long. Because their magic weapon is not entirely in the physical body. The special masterpiece sitting in front of me now has its magic weapon entirely in this six-foot body; and this body is more fragile than this teacup. It is less durable than this sofa, and less durable than this cigarette can (he invited me to smoke Three-Five brand)! In contrast, how emotional and regretful I am? So I warmly urged him to record more phonograph records and shoot more sound and color movies in the future. Although records and movies are also perishable, they are much more permanent than these short ten years, and can also be used to comfort feelings. But according to him, there seem to be various obstacles, and he cannot do what he wants. What led me to visit was the photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan, and the two gentlemen Chen Jingyu and Sheng Xueming, who brought their cameras. The two gentlemen took many photos of us in Mr. Mei's yard. After the photography was over, I said goodbye. He shook my hand for a long time. A palmist said: "A man's hand is valuable for being soft, and a woman's hand is valuable for being hard." The softness of his hand surprised me.</p>
<p>After separating from Mr. Lang and others, I thought alone on the way home: From the perspective of religion's great personality with no beginning and no end, art is originally a fleeting flower and a flash of lightning; when it is spiritual, it fades, so why cherish it! It is strange that the creator is too uncalculated; since it is made so exquisitely, its warranty period should be extended; since the warranty period is not willing to be extended, then there is no need to make it so exquisitely; it can be done casually and perfunctorily, which can also make people reduce a lot of foolishness.</p>
<p>Alas! Mischievous creator! Suddenly, the dark clouds covered Shanghai's thousands of people. I vaguely heard the voice of the creator: "Your warranty period is one day shorter!" (End) Written in Hangzhou on June 2, 1936.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>September 17th of that year</p>
<p>Burnt to ashes. Jin Chengjiang, a place devoid of everything except various epidemics, unexpectedly detained the New China Theater troupe for five days. Because they had no gold bars or US dollars and were unwilling to easily disband, they couldn't find a ride to take them away quickly. Finally, gritting their teeth, they squeezed onto a slow, ox-paced vehicle together, quietly leaving this desperate place.</p>
<p>The rumors spread like wildfire, growing more intense daily. Some even said that Japanese soldiers in plainclothes had entered Guizhou.</p>
<p>Life on the train was truly unbearable! The locomotive, pulling a mixed passenger and freight train three or four times longer than usual, lacked sufficient coal and couldn't move as it pleased. Every few kilometers, obstacles appeared on the tracks, so its speed was even slower than a hand-pushed wheelbarrow. The train was so crowded that every place where one could stand, sit, or hang was utilized. Lao Zhu spent an entire day and night holding Fei Fei, perched high on the back of a seat in a third-class carriage, like a bird huddled in a cage, or even worse. Because even though a bird in a cage cannot fly, at least it can turn its body or hop up and down, but Lao Zhu absolutely could not. He seemed to have become a taxidermied bird, pinned to the cedar-wood backrest. People were all around him, and if they didn't jostle him, he couldn't move at all. In reality, even if they wanted to give him space, they couldn't, because they were also squeezed by others. The entire carriage, with hundreds of people, had frozen into an immobile mass. The air was filled with carbon dioxide exhaled from people's mouths and noses, plus the unbearable stench from people relieving themselves everywhere, causing the old, weak, women, and children to gradually become unable to endure it and faint.</p>
<p>Fei Fei was a child under eight years old, forced to curl up in Lao Zhu's arms, not moving for an entire day and night, which was even more painful than adults enduring the journey. Getting food was so difficult. Not to mention meals, even plain water was often unavailable for four or five hours at a time. When she needed to relieve herself, Lao Zhu had to negotiate with the people sitting nearby to make way for her. He was anxious that Fei Fei would get sick from hunger and thirst, so from the moment he boarded the train, he was worried about Fei Fei getting sick.</p>
