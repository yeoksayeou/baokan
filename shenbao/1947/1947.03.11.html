<h3>中央决本寬大政策處理台灣不幸事件　主席曉諭台胞嚴守紀律</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕主席關懷台灣局勢，昨晚九時召見白部長祟禧等，長談一小時，十日續與要員會見，上午出席中樞紀念週時，表示此次台灣暴動事件，決非僅爲為簡單之行政及經濟問題，事態之擴大，與潛伏台灣共黨不無關係，且有前在南洋參加日本侵略之台灣海陸軍人混跡其間，政府頃已決定派遺白部長前往宣慰，並辦理善後，合省黨部主委李翼中等將隨行。白部長十日晨曾召見李翼中有所垂詢，十日晚並曾接見台灣六團體代表，當晚九時又謁主席，白氏一二日即可成行。同時，中央已決定派朱紹良繼陳儀任台省主席，此事俟白部長赴台宣慰歸來後，即可發表。廿一師師長劉雨卿，昨日下午會同國防部高參謀多人同乘美齡號專機飛赴台灣，此外，或將另派一師前往增防，分駐台灣各要區，以謀地方秩序早日恢復。據悉：「二二八」事件處理委員會曾有決議，通知政府武裝部隊自動解除武裝，故觀其企岡已非僅麗要求改良政治範團而已，跡近背叛中央，京中有地位人士之觀察，認爲目前合灣局勢亟宜及早處理，不可失之太遲，以免擴大。又據合省黨部主委李翼中十日語本報記者，中央將本下列三大原則，處理台灣事件，（一）取寬大政策，一切從大處着手，（二）在憲法範圍以內，採納民衆合法要求，（三）台省政制，務使與內地各省相同，至提前實行縣長民選事，台胞要求於本年六月份開始，中央對此正研究中。</p>
<h3>政府大員即赴台　維持治安軍隊抵基隆</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕中樞十日上午九時舉行總理紀念週，由蔣主席領導，行禮如儀，農林部長周詒春報告該部三十五年度工作槪况後，主席對台灣此次發生不幸事件之經過與中央處理之方針，有所指示，略謂：此次台灣不幸事件之起因，各報多已刊載，不必詳述。緣自去年收復台灣以後，中央以台灣地方秩序良好，故朱多派正規電隊駐紮，地方治安，悉由憲警維持，一年來台省農工商學各界同胞原有守法精神與擁護中央精誠，愈表示其愛國自愛之精神，實不亞於任何省份之同胞。惟煨近竟有昔被日本征兵調往南洋一帶作戰之台人，其中一部份爲共產黨員，乃藉此次專賈局取締攤販，乘機煽惑，造成暴動，並提出改革政治之要求，中央以憲政即將實施，而且台灣行政本應早復常軌，故凡憲法規定地方政府應有之權限，中火儘可授予地方，提前實施。陳長官秉承中央指示，已公開宣布，定期改設省政府，取消長官公署，並允於一定期限內實施縣長民選，全台同胞對此皆表示歡欣，極願接受，故此次不幸事件本已可告一段落，不料上星期五（七日）該省所謂「二二八事件處理委員會」突提出無理要求，有取消台灣警備司令部，繳卸武器，由該會保管，並要求台灣陸海軍皆由台灣人充任。此種要求己踰越地方政治之範圍，中央自不能承認，而且日昨又有襲擊機關等不法行動相繼發生，故中央已決派軍隊赴台，維持當地治安。據報所派部隊昨夜已在基隆安全登陸，秩序亦佳，深信不久當可恢復常態。同時並將派遣大員赴台，協助陳長官處理此次事件，本人並已嚴電留台軍政人員，靜候中央派員處理，不得採取報復行動，以期全合同胞親愛團結，互助合作，務希台省同胞深明大義，嚴守紀律，勿爲奸黨所利用，勿爲日人所竊笑，冥行盲動，害國自害，切望明順逆，辨利害，徹底覺悟，自重的取消非法組織，恢復地方秩序，俾全台省同胞皆得早日安居樂業，以完成新台灣之建設，始能無負於全國同胞五十年來爲光復台灣而忍痛犧牲，艱苦奮鬥也。</p>
<h3>「二二八」事件處理會　陳長官下令解散　向全台廣播決嚴懲叛徒</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十日電〕台省「二二八」事件處理委員會，近日之行爲越出要求改革政治範圍，跡近反叛祖國。陳儀長官十日下令，予以解散。陳氏才日上午十時向全省台胞廣播稱：一諸君所希望解決之緝私傷人問題及改善政治問題，余幾已完全允諾，但有少數叛徒，懷抱叛國陰謀，余決予以嚴厲裁制」。陳氏又稱：「至於國軍移駐台灣，係爲保護全省人民，消滅叛徒，絕無其他用意。日前外省人員遭毆打時，多數善良之台胞，予以救護。此種義氣，係出於眞潔之同胞愛。余表衷心之感謝。今後仍盼善良之台胞，發揮正義感。彼此相親相愛，協力建設新台灣」。自昨日起，台省局國，已趨穩定，各機關自明起，恢復辦公。</p>
<h3>台灣警備總部發表吿民衆書</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十日電〕台灣省警備總司令部十日發表告民衆　書。全文如下：</p>
<p>此次「二二八」事件發生，政府當時除將專賣局肇事人員解　法院依法嚴懲，並分別撫恤死亡外，對因「二二八」事件而引起之政治問題，政府亦曲從民意，接受所提案件。意謂事變從此可告一段落，乃竟有少戰陰謀份子，企圖利用機會，奪取政權，背叛國家，從台北一隅開端，佔據廣播電台，歪曲事實，盡情渲染，鼓動民衆暴動，風聲所播，全省騷然，以至全省行政官吏，或被挾持，或被毀辱，政府機關或被佔領，或被搗毀，外省公務人員及經商來台者，或被刦殺，或被傷殘，慘毒所加，雖婦孺不能倖免。死傷之鉅，旣難數計，事變演成，史乏前例。日本則變本加厲，愈變愈烈，言論行動，均置國紀民意於不顧，造成無政府狀態。更進而主張解除國軍武裝，撤消警備總部，氣熖彌天，殆非使台灣脫離中國而生存不可。其爲背叛國家，昭然若揭。</p>
<p>本部受命統帥警備台灣，凡我全台同胞，應自今起，各安生業，信賴政府，遵照政府政治解決途徑，共向建設三民主義歲新台灣之途邁進。倘或毀法壞紀，行動越軌，本部爲求安定地方，祇有行使職權，依法處理，不稍游移。至於參加此次暴動之份十，或被脅從，或係盲動，於法雖不可恕，論情自有可原。如不自外生民再蹈法網，當予從寬免究。</p>
<p>「太康」號旗艦奉命駛抵基隆</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據海軍方面消息：奉派赴日佔領之海軍旗艦「太康」號，茲因台灣發生騷動，事態嚴重，於八日深晚奉主席急電，先行駛赴台灣鎮壓，該艦現已抵達基隆。至何時赴日，另候命令。</p>
<h3>楊監使錢署長慰問受傷同胞</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十日電〕閩台監察使楊亮功及行總分署署長錢宗起，今往市區各公私醫院慰問受傷同胞。各院現均缺乏食米及藥品，錢氏允予撥助。楊氏今下午往訪陳儀長官晤談甚久。</p>
<h3>榕垣人士焦灼</h3>
<p>〔本報福州十日電〕台灣滋擾事件消息傳至此間後，各界人士至表關切。閩省參會昨去電查詢眞象，蓋閩台僅一衣帶水之隔，向來痛癢相關。台灣光復後，閩籍公務員携眷渡海過台服務者，不下數萬人。據台北歸客談，此决事發，旅合閩籍公務員，死傷最多，留閩親屬聞變莫不戚然，街頭競相探詢消息。電報局極度擁擠，一般反應，情緒陰沉。</p>
<h3>台南民衆選舉過渡時期市長</h3>
<p>〔中央計台南十日電〕台南市全體參議員區里長人民團體，及學生代表等四千餘人，昨日下午集會，依據陳儀長官之諾言，推舉七月一日實行縣市長民選以前過渡期間之市長。結果黃百祿以一七九票，侯全成一〇九票，湯德章一〇五票當選，名單日內即可呈報省署，以便圈定新任市長。按黃氏現任本市參議會議長，並執行律師業務，侯氏爲市參議員（醫師），湯氏任市人民自由保障委員會主委（律師）。</p>
<h3>行政院有關人士否認王雲五辭職</h3>

<h3>在京中委談話會　劉斐王世杰等分別報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕在京中委談話會，十日下午三時似中央黨部舉行，到中委七十餘人，張繼主席，首由劉參謀長斐檢討軍事，繼由王外長世杰報告國際情勢及視察東北經過，最後由彭部長學沛分析中外與情，至五時半始散。聞王外長報告中曾述及此次前赴東北，對蘇軍撤退及物資被拆情形，曾加調查，政府現正擬具計劃，俾向賠償委會提出。</p>
<h3>資助本國工業減少外滙消耗</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕聞當局爲防止外匯大量流出，近曾通過一項辦法，儘量以貸款等方法，協助可用本國原料品製造之工業，使其產量得以增加，以减少外貨入口。此種原料品，將包括棉·菸·小麥等。如是，上方面可增加國庫收入，一方面可使外匯不致消耗。此外，我國關稅，戰前因受日人壓迫，一般均低。至今大部仍爲戰前標準，將來如予提高，當非全不合理。</p>

<h3>台胞均願效力祖國不幸事件應早解决</h3>
<p>— 台省六團體代表在京招待記者</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕台省建設協會等六團體代表，十日下午四時招待記者，報吿「二二八」事件眞相及台胞對政府請求各點。各代表對蔣主席今日於國府所昭示之處置台灣事件方針，咸表擁護，惟盼台胞所提合理要求，能爲當軕所採納，並否認此次事件係受不良份子策動之有計劃的反抗中央行為。</p>
<p>招待曾開始後，首由楊　嘉嘉致詞，說明台省光復之初，合胞對祖國期望如何殷切，常時該地六百萬同胞，莫不願在祖國復興工作中，貢獻其力量，然過去一年六個月中，陳長官種種描施，在在難令台胞心服。造成今日後果，陳氏實難辭其得。楊氏堅決否認，此次事件有「不良份子」從中策動，並不信此事目的在「反抗中央」。楊氏以激動語氣聲稱：「日投降後，台灣爲一片乾凈土地，余可以生命保證，台胞無不服從中央」。最後，鄭重希望六百萬合胞之呼聲，能上達中央，並盼事件能早獲解決。</p>
<p>繼由陳碧笙報告，此次事件經過與責任問題。對陳長官在台措施亦猛施坪擊，並深惜去歲來京請願所提反對特殊化各點，未能爲中樞採納。陳說明渠等對蔣主席今日在國府紀念週昭示之處理台灣事件方針，深致擁護。惟鄭重聲明兩點：一·此次事件，完全係人民因受不住陳畏官稱種政續而暴發之一種自動的反抗，絕無任何背景，更非有計劃之行動。二·台胞始終愛護祖國，始終認爲係中華民國同胞一份子，並認台灣係祖國領土一部份，絕無反抗中央，排擠外省同胞情事。陳並不否認，難免不有少數別有用心之不良份子，混跡其間。然謂此僅為極少數中之極少數。</p>
<p>速派大員處理善後</p>
<p>陳氏希望政府寬大為本，以大局為重，鄭重處理此次事件。派兵赴　，易滋誤會，盼能速派大員赴台宣　，處理善後，恢復秩序，又謂，行政長官公署，旣遲早須撤消，則以及早撤銷為宜。最後，王麗明等，亦相繼致詞，詳述台胞希望。招待會畢，　邦傑等即往晋謁白部長崇禧，就台灣事件有所商談</p>
<p>處理委會非法要求</p>
<p>〔中央社台北十日電〕台省「二二八」事件處理委員會，除通過改革政治建義案卅二條外，並曾對於處理目前問題通過「政府在各地之武裝部隊自動應下卫暫時解除武裝一案，此項消息，先由本埠報紙刋載後，咸認該會之動機，已非全係出於要求改良政治，而係企岡背叛國家。該會雖於八日發出聲明稱，因當時參加會　之人數衆多，未及一一推敲，例如撤銷警備總部及國軍繳械，跡近反叛中央，決非省民公意，然同日夜十時半，仍有暴徒分別攻擊東門警備總部，圓山海軍辦事處，樺山町警務處，企岡强迫政府之武裝部隊繳械。政府方面認爲軍隊乃國家之軍隊，遂於九日上午六時起再行下令戒嚴，並將交通及電信機構暫由軍事管制，台省警備總部今日上午並發表通告稱：「自十日起，所有非法定團體一律取銷，並禁止集會遊行。」該部同時規定民間所有之槍枝，須即前往該部登記，倘經查出，必予嚴懲。</p>
<p>美方官員飛台訪詢</p>
<p>〔又電〕美國大使館軍事參贊鐸上校，今日上午十時分別拜會陳儀長官及警備總部參謀黃柯遠芬。鐸氏係於昨日上午十時，自滬乘軍用機來台。聞渠與陳長官談話時，對於此次紛擾事件，曾就其個人印象，表示「目前此間情形，已極穩定，秩序良好，美僑之生命財產，亦均獲得安全保陣。」鐸氏今日下午乘原機返滬。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本市曾盛傳台灣長官公署，亦被暴徒包圍。此說迄未證實，台灣行政長官公署與其駐滬通訊處之電訊聯絡，自九日下午五時開始斷絕後，迄發稿時，尙未恢復。但外傳台灣銀行總行，已於九日夜被暴徒搗毀說，據該行上海分行謝經理語記者，絕不可靠。蓋行總上海分署，昨午尚接得台灣銀行消息，報告平安無事也。大多數台民，極表不滿。陳儀長官，原定於三中全會前飛京述職，現徇當地士紳之要求，決定將行期無定期展緩，繼續坐鎭，以維秩序。</p>
<p>又外傳招商局台北分局被台人侵佔一說，頃據該局胡副總經理時淵稱，該局台北分局，昨日下午會有電報來滬報告平安無事，似出誤傳。</p>
<p>另據招商局負責方面稱，該局滬台錢輪船仍照常航行，所有電訊亦未中斷。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕「二二八」事件後駛台之「中興號」及「台南號」，均已平安抵達，惟因當地秩序尚未完全恢復，各外省人爲顯及其生命及貨物之安全計，均未上岸，將隨原船折返。據悉，中興號可於明（十二）日抵滬云。</p>

<h3>改組政府商談進展　民靑兩黨不參加技術部門蔣勻田飛港雷震改今返京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕改組政府之商談，現已進入人事配合階段。據政府某要員談：關於各黨參加各部門之商談，雖未至最後決定之時期，惟大致可知悉者，即民靑兩黨對拔術性之部門，均將因人材欠缺而不參加，至所參加之部門，原定各部之部長决長，採交換制，頃因山國政界多人事糾紛，故目前可能決定部長次長屬一黨。又外傳靑年黨將長司法行政部一事不確。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨全面參加政府事，尚待留港兩常委來滬後，始能決定。據某要員表示：七日左右伍憲子曾有電報來滬，表示短期內尚難頗港，並希望於三中全會會舉行之後，再考慮全面參加之事。政府方面希望蔣勻田即日赴港，迎接伍憲子李大明雨氏早日來滬，以免改組政府事拖延過久，故蔣勻田氏已於昨日離滬赴港。聞伍憲子對於同時開放地方政權一點，相當堅持，與靑年黨主張頗爲接近。又民社黨北方代表胡海門，梁秋水兩氏，將於十二日抵滬。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨對參加政府問題，內部意見未趨一致，但並無外傳分裂之現象。該黨副主席伍憲子，留港未返，係因私務未了。渠與李大明二人，對政府改組之意見，認爲地方政府之改組，與中央政府之改組，同等重要，與其他人士所待見解，並無顯著不同。北方之梁秋水，胡海門，並無脫黨表示，如無意外事故，二氏日內當可抵滬。</p>

<h3>南京大屠殺主犯　谷壽夫判處死刑　判决書宣讀後當庭送達</h3>
<p>〔本報兩京十日電〕南京大屠殺案主獲　　夫，十日下午在理在京勵志社臨時公開法庭被宣判　　。石處長等準時出庭，旋即　谷犯到庭，谷仍着往日服裝，自始至終神情靜定，毫無慌張神色。首由石庭長訊問姓名籍貫　後，即讀判決書，並即譯爲日語，谷聞「死刑」二字後，亦不變色，判決書宣讀時間長達四十分鐘，谷犯於最後請求發給日文判決書，未允所請，判決書即作本日送達，並宣佈依法谷犯於十日內可向我統帥提出抗說話，經批准後發回更審，否則依法執行。茲錄主文如次：「谷壽夫在作戲期間，共同縱兵，　殺俘虜及非戰鬥人員，並強　，搶刦，破壞財產，處死刑。」</p>
<p>判决書要點</p>
<p>事實：谷壽夫係日本軍閥中慄悍善戰之將領。民國廿六年中日戰起，充任第六師團長，是年末率部來華，參預侵略戰爭，先轉戰於河北永定河及保定石家莊等處，同年十一月杪，我京滬沿綫戰事頻告失利，移轉陳地，扼守南京，日本軍關以我首都爲抗戰中心，遂糾集其精銳，而兇殘之第六師團谷壽夫　　，第十六師團中島部隊第十八師團牛島部隊，第一一四師團末松部隊等，在松井石根大將指揮之下，合力會攻，幷以遭遇我軍堅强柢抗忿恨之餘，乃於陷城後，作有計劃之屠殺，以示報復。由谷壽夫所率之第六師團任前鋒，於廿六年十二月十二日（即農曆十一月十日）傍晚，攻陷中華門，先頭部隊用繩梯攀垣而入，即開始屠殺，翌晨復率大軍城進，與中島牛島末松等部隊，分　京市各區，展開大規模層殺，繼以焚燒擄掠。</p>
<p>殺·戮</p>
<p>屠殺最慘厲之時期，厭爲廿六年十二月十二日至同月廿一日，亦即在谷壽夫部隊駐京之期間內，計於中華門外花神廟·實塔橋·石觀音·下關·草鞋峽等處，我被俘軍民被日軍用機檐集體射殺，並焚屍滅跡者，有單總人等十九萬餘人，此外零星屠殺，其屍體經慈善機關收理者十五萬餘具，被害總數達三十萬人以上，展橫週地，慘絕人實，其殘酷之情狀，允非筆墨所能形容。如十二月十五日下午一時，我軍警二千餘各，爲日軍俘獲後，解赴漢中門外，用機槍密集掃射，飲彈齊殞，其負傷未死者，悉遭活焚。同月十六日下午六時，　集華僑招待所之難民五千餘人，被日兵押往中山碼頭浦中，尚能掙扎者均遭亂刀戳斃，幷將全部屍骸澆以煤汕焚化。又如十二月十二日，鄕婦王徐氏，在中華門外下碼頭，遭日軍梟首焚屍。同月十三日，鄉民魏小山，因谷壽夫部隊在中華門堆草巷縱火，前往施救，竟被砍死。同日僧隆敬　　及尼眞行燈高燈元等，亦於中華門外廟庵內悉遭屠戳。十四日市民姚加隆携眷避難於中華門斬龍橋，又遭日軍將其妻姦殺，八歲幼兒三歲幼女因在旁哀泣，被用槍尖挑人火中，活焚而斃，同月十三日至十七日，時值　寒，駐中華門外日軍勒令鄕民卅餘人，入水撈魚，從則凍　，違則遭戰，幷將一老叟綁懸樹稍，以槍描準，作打靶練習，於至繩　跌斃。又日軍官二人，以殺人爲競賽，其一殺達百零五人，一則以殺百零六人獲勝。同月十九日，鄕婦謝善眞，年逾六旬，被日軍在中華門外東岳廟用刀划殺，幷以竹竿插入陰戶，均屬慘無人道。計自十二月十二日至同月十七日，我首都無辜軍民，被日軍殘殺而有案可稽者，達八百八十六起。其在中華門門一帶被害者，除以上列舉外，尚有王福和，柯大才，除翁氏等三百七十八案。（未完）</p>
<h3>判死刑軍法犯得案情減刑</h3>
<p>限去年底以前犯罪者</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州十日電〕國防部頃電令各省縣市及各級軍事機關知照，謂：　　國防部核准死刑之軍法案犯，若犯罪在三十五年十二月三十一日以前，而案情合乎减刑條例者，應即停止執行，依法减刑。</p>

<h3>上海市政府組織規程的檢討</h3>
<p>上海市政府組織規程，自經行政院通過，並經各報披露以後，因為組織大加緊縮，市府所屬人員三千三百餘人，將減至一千九百餘人，影響太大，頗引起世人注間。其實員額的多寡還不過本問題的一面，其另一面，還有各局職權的調整一點，更値得注目。茲將現行制度與新制度中所載各局的職掌，逐一比較，紀共增减與變更的項目如左，以供探討。</p>
<p>第一，現制所無，而爲新制所增入者，如下：</p>
<p>民政局（原爲民政處）加入（一）關於市區域劃定事項，（二）關於禮俗宗敎事項（原屬社會局）（三）關於禁烟禁毒事項。（向無明文規定）</p>
<p>財政局加入（一）關於公營事業之經營管理事項，（二）關於國稅稽征之協助事項。</p>
<p>敎育局加入音樂，戲劇，電影，播音，及其他美化敎育，（大部分原屬社會局所管）</p>
<p>社會局加入關於新生活運動事項，此事原屬該局主管，但無明文規定。</p>
<p>地政局加入關於公有十地之處理事項，亦原屬該局所主管，但無明文規定者。</p>
<p>衛生局加入（一）關於衛生敎育及衛生人目訓練事項，（二）關於生命統計事項，（三）關於細菌病及藥物化學之檢騐，分析事項，（三）關於市轄醫院，傳集病院，及衛生所等機關之監督事項。</p>
<p>工務局加入（一）關於船舶及飛機之管理事項，（二）關於農林工礦漁牧事項。（原屬社會局）</p>
<p>警察局加入（一）關於稽查彈壓事項，（二）關於協助兵役及戶政事項。</p>
<p>第二，新制所無，而現制分別列舉者，如下；</p>
<p>財政局刪去（一）關於市銀行之監督指揮事項，（二）關於本市經濟之調查調整事項。</p>
<p>敎育局刪去（一）關於職業敎育事項，（二）關於國民體育及衛生敎育事項。</p>
<p>社侖局刪去（一）關於農工商行政事項，（二）關於工廠檢查事項，（三）關於造林，墾牧，漁獵，之保護及取締事項，（四）關於書報影劇之管理事項，（五）關於宗敎之監督指揮，及風俗改良事項。</p>
<p>地政局刪去（一）關於地產經紀人之監督事項，（二）關於公地改良，荒地墾植，及農林敎塲之管理推廣車項。</p>
<p>衛生局刪去（一）關於飲食物之檢騐，管理，及全市藥械，血淸，疫苗之供應事項，（二）關於垃圾糞便之處理事項。</p>
<p>工務局刪去（一）關於都市計劃之調查設計，（二）關於技師廠商登記執照之核發，查勘，取締事項，（三）關於工程規範之厘訂及材料之檢騐事項。</p>
<p>公用局刪去（一）關於水陸空交通之監督指導事項，但增列車輛交通檢騐一條，或已包括在內，（二）關於碼頭倉庫之規劃及管理事項，（三）關於水陸空交通駕駛人員曁水，電，媒氣技工廠商之登記，給照，考騐，及取締事項，（三）關於路燈，標準鐘，及市有廣播電台之建設及管理事項，（四）關於公用事業之器材規範，服務標準，及資費價格之厘訂執行事項。</p>
<p>警察局刪去（一）關於警區之設置及變更事項，（二）關於調查特種戶口及外事警察事項，（三）關於刑事案件之偵查事項。</p>
<p>就形式論，以衛生局之變更爲最多。牠的職掌條文，非但與現制諸多出入，亦與最近核定的南京市組織完全不同。牠不像其他各局，大體上多抄襲南京市組織規程之成規。以實質論，則以社會局之緊縮爲最鮮明。例如農林工礦漁牧劃歸工務局，宗敎禮俗劃歸民政處，影劇劃歸敎育局。其農工商行政，工廠檢查事項，書報管理事項，這三項，究竟劃歸何處，竟找不到下文。又新生活運動，旨在移風易俗，明係禮俗事項，却不併入民政處，而特地爲該局增列一條，也很不易索解。有人說：現在實行民主，以後一切書報，大的不予管理，這自然也言之成理。不過工廠檢查和一切農工商行政，是否亦照比例，一概予以放任？不能令人無疑。上海市政府最初成立時，原有農工商局，後與公益局合併乃改稱社侖局，此爲中國有社會局之始，而本市又是否國唯一的工商大埠，我們不信，這項行政，以後可以一槪放棄。又有人說：現在各部在滬，大都設有各式辦事處，或許將收歸中央自辦，無頃地方管理，這也是一種說法。而且在本市財政極度困維，正苦無法裁員減政之際，或亦具有相當的理由。不過按照此例，可以收歸中央自辦的，又何止農工商行政這一種？而且適用此例的，又何止上海一市？</p>
<p>垃圾糞便的處理，在衛生局是一種極繁重的工作，且是一筆大宗的收入和支出。官辦商辦，直到最近，方由參議會通過了原則。新制內也把牠完全剔除，不知是何用意。我們不相信，這事也可解釋爲將由中央衛生署收回自辦。至農林工礦漁獵一類，一槪劃入工務局辦理，是否有點老韓同傳，過於牽强，實在也不易了解。衛生敎育，己歸入衛生局，這還說得過去。但職業敎育，是否可以完全省略，却還値得研究。最不可解的，是國民義務勞動這一項，中央儘管三令五申，督促舉辦，在新制內竟沒有提起，不知應該由那處理委員會結束後，有許多當事人碰來碰去，找不到一個主管機關，新制內同樣沒有提到，似乎也是一個缺點。</p>
<p>依照嚴格的法律手績，這項組織規程，還須送經立法院審議。以上這些問題，希望在立法的過程中，能獲得適當的補救。</p>

<h3>外長會議在風雪中揭幕　莫洛托夫任主席　馬卿表示决促成四國公約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十日廣播：四强外長會議，今日下午五時（莫斯科時間，上海時間下午十時）在狂風大雪中展幕，由蘇外長莫洛托夫任主席，儀式簡單。各外畏乘車至蘇維埃航空工業大厦（距克林姆宮二英里），馬歇爾首先到達，貝文與皮杜爾旋亦蒞至。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：美法英三國外長本日在開會前曾舉行非正式會談，交換意見。先是馬歇爾與貝文會晤，今晨皮杜爾亦訪馬歇爾作一小時之談話。四外長會議之程序迄未決定，但馬歇爾在今晨談話中，復透露若干要點：（一）美方在此次會議中之政策，將基於波茨坦協定中有關德國之條例，以及貝爾納斯在史都伽特演詞中之原則；（二）美方決繼續努力，促成四强四十年協定之締結，使德方無法再起侵略；（三）對奧和約將提前討論。至於中國問題是否將予討論，馬氏避不答覆。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十日電〕蘇聯外長莫洛托夫今日午後接見美國務卿馬歇爾作初次酬酢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十日電〕四外長會議地點，將在莫斯科城外之航空俱樂部，蘇聯事前極端保守秘密，致使西方各國代表團在星期日夜，尙不能確知今日之會議究在何處舉行。航空俱樂部之全名為「蘇維埃航空工業大厦」，在沙皇時代，此為一華麗之吉卜賽跳舞地帶。</p>
<p>馬歇爾此次參加四强會議以及其訪問蘇京，尙屬首次，故保特安靜莊嚴，甚至帶冷酷之態度。渠在昨日傍晚祗接見貝文，此次爲馬歇爾任國務卿以來首次之重大試騐，未來數周會議之爭執，目光之焦點皆集中於渠一人，較任何人為甚。渠保證實現其前任貝爾納斯所進行之政策，但該政策將為馬歇爾不獨對蘇聯之戰術，並且為對居於重要地位英法之戰術，同時首先唱出謹愼而樂觀之調論者亦為馬歇爾，渠雖警吿前途有甚大困難，惟預言此項困難將以和平談判加以解決。然美法英三國代表中頗多表示悲觀者。</p>
<h3>會議主要目標　四項文件將為討論基礎</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十日電〕四國外長會議之主要目標如下：</p>
<p>「蘇聯」——要求實施波茨坦協定，四國共管德國，但同時又須有一統一的德國。</p>
<p>「美國」——希望依照前任國務卿貝爾納斯規定之路綫，締結協定，祖保德國永遠解除武裝。</p>
<p>「英國」——希望莫斯科會議帮助英蘇條約有效時期延長至五十年。</p>
<p>「法國」——共管魯爾工業區。上列問題四國縱不能全部解決，但可能成立實質的協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科九日電〕此間觀察家頃評論四國外長會議今後之工作稱：四外長會議，開始時殆將極為困難，頗難望其獲致迅速之結果。四國外長會議將有四項文件，作為其討論之出發點與基礎，此即（一）對奧和的草案，四國外决前在倫敦會議，所獲成就，遠較其他各項問題為大，故四外長如能就若干懸案（如保證奧國之獨立及與境德國資產之處置方法等）迅速成立協議，則對與和約極可能在外長會議期間，草擬成，甚至在莫斯科即可簽訂。</p>
<p>（二）四外次會議對於起草對德和約之程序所提出之報吿書，各方對於此一問題頗多意見不同之處，殊難加以解決，尤其是若干在四外長會議中無代表出席之國家，將以何種方式參與對德和約之起草工作一層，意見頗為紛歧。（三）四外次會議，就四强以外各盟國對於德國問題之意見所提出之報吿書。（四）盟國管制德國委會所提出之報吿書，此即檢討四强自德國投陳至一九四七年二月在德境佔領區內之工作情形者也。按此項報吿書原係由四強聯合起草，俾表示每一佔領區均實施波茨坦協定之一致原則，但四國佔領區基於各種理由，尤其是因為對於波茨坦協定之精神發生根本誤會，故其實施該項協定之原則時，亦各有不同。此種不同主要之點，（一）解除德國軍備與肅淸納粹之措施；（二）德國之對外貿易計劃；（三）德國之臨時行政組織。四國佔領當局在上述各方面均依照其本身之槪念與利益而行事。</p>
<h3>捷奧談判昨開始　分別在兩國京城舉行</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格九日電〕此間消息靈通人士貫談稱，捷克一奧地利定十日起在普拉格吸維也納兩地同時舉行談判，雙方在普拉格之談判，旨在締結商務條約，此在維也納之談判，則為討論捷克對於奧地利之領土要求。捷克方面要求取得多瑙河沿岸，勃拉蒂斯拉伐對面之一小部份奧地利領土，俾至日後，奧得河與多瑙河間開闢運河後，在該處建築港口設備，捷克願予奧地租以經濟上之便利，以賠償其領土之損失云。</p>
<h3>英美對德奧政策　蘇報著文抨擊</h3>
<p>〔聯合社英斯科九日電〕外長會議開幕前夕，蘇外交權威周報「新時代」發表大批文章，嚴厲指責英美對德奧政策，並指摘美代表團三主要代表，即奧境美軍司令克拉克。共和黨領袖杜勒斯及對德經濟問題專家特萊波。據稱，美蘇擬在德國樹立聯邦政體，實為一種「模糊方式」，及西方資本主義壟斷德西部資源之手段，同時在德國東西兩佔領區間樹立一道「萬里長城」。當前問題厥為德國是否將改造成為和平之國家，或成為帝國主義之附庸。該周報文中指責杜勒斯之關於德國之各項建議，並稱，邱吉爾為「不列顚帝國主義之老狐狸」，英美將　境佔領區在經濟上合併，其野心乃欲不惜一切代價，拯救德國之反動勞力，並袒護其經濟勢力免被淸算。馬歇爾之經濟顧間杜勒斯，即為此種計劃創議者之一。總之，偏狹的壟斷的團體，正在指揮如何改組德國，此種團號唯利是圖，為害甚大，必須以民主與進步之全部力量，堅決加以驅逐。另一論文指責英美對奧境內德人資產之政策，而述及克拉克之態度，認為英美此舉違反協定尤其是英美支持奧地利將某項事業收歸國營。蘇聯認為此種事業乃德國資產，須沒收以充賠償。「新時代」雜誌之論文，向以檢討外交政策為主，此間各國大使館正密切加以注意，蓋蘇聯之未來政策如何，或可在其中發現蛛絲馬跡。</p>
<h3>美國對希政策將作重大决定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕社魯門總統今日向共和黨國會代表團申述其干預希臘局勢之計劃時，衆人殆將要求其說明一切，並亦將促其勿可忘却中國之局勢。衆料社魯門對此美國有史以來最嚴重之外交決策，當將向十四位國會領袖，申言美國必須接收英國所遺下之重大任務，以使希臘共黨陷於困境，但對於不使用美國軍隊一點，杜魯門當亦將向各議員加以保證，此一爆炸性間題在數日內即將引起爭辯，其性質或足以改變美國之整個外交政策。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統邀請國會領袖明日至白宮，討論英國减少駐希臘軍隊後美國所擬進行之援助辦法，今日正與白宮幕僚從事準備。據國會議員事先所作評論，已明白表示攘請總統就以下兩事作詳細說明：（一）美國出而援助希臘對於蘇聯之關係；（二）美國對土耳其及地中　他處所作績極援助之可能的擴屬</p>
<h3>貝文莫洛托夫　互祝壽辰</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科九日電」六十六歲的貝文外相與五十七歲的莫洛托夫外長，今日互祝相壽，蓋今日同為斷人之誕辰故也。一般人認為雙壽臨門，是乃莫斯科會議之吉兆。</p>
<h3>美擬貸款韓國</h3>
<p>俾與建韓南交通事</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕官方消息靈通人士今日宣稱：美國　備緊急援助希臘之時，對於朝鮮亦已擬就貸數方案，俾得從事莫建朝鮮南部美軍佔領區鐵路及其他交通事業，並修復紡織等業工廠。此項方案，一俟希　問題解決，即可提付國會討論。貸款數目究有若干為不可知，目下佔領費則每年約須一億美元左右。</p>
<h3>英政府經濟方案下院中將起激辯　保守黨準備彈劾政府</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：艾德禮之工黨政府今正遇空前危機，內閣有重大改組之可能。下院討論政府最近經濟方案，定期三日，邱吉爾領導下之保守然表示不信任，衆料保守黨與自由黨聯合反政府票數可達二百之多。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十日電〕據倫敦最後消息稱：工黨政府之危機可告無虞，蓋縱然反對票可達二百票，然下院六百四十席中，工黨究佔三百九十四席也。艾德禮苜相已要求各議員無論如何不可放棄投票云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教十日電〕商務大臣克里浦斯將於今日向下議院提出經濟方案，並籲請全國國民之合作，政府屆時將動議請議院批准此項方案，而保守黨領袖邱吉爾等則準備提出修正案，對政府之未能早將事實公開，表示遺憾，並認政府今後之方案旣不適當，抑且有害，對於一再加重國家困難之政府，不能表示信任。該修正案如獲通過，即等於彈劾政府。自由黨議員台維斯等八人，亦將提出修正案，譴責政府之未能預視目前之困難，及時採取適當措施。此次辯論為期當有三天，政府方面之艾德禮首相·道爾頓財相·國防大臣亞歷山大·勞工大臣伊薩克，均將發言，邱吉爾則定於星期三提出保守黨之修正案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕下院明日起將討論經濟問題，艾德禮首相為應付起見，今日召集工黨「叛變」議員百餘人舉行秘密會議，從事堅壁淸野政策。</p>
<h3>美令各地佔領軍收加軍票掉新鈔　預料東京可收兌六千萬美元</h3>
<p>〔合衆社佛朗克福十日電〕德境美佔領軍當局，在其取締西歐全部之偽造軍鈔命令發出後一小時半，共逮捕人犯九名，其中三人為美陸軍官，上人為陸軍部之文職雇員。此一命令，據陸軍官員稱，將在全世界同時實施，該命令由美軍駐歐司令麥克納尼所發佈，命令其所有之部屬，在星期日九小時限制內，將軍鈔兌換另一種新鈔。據麥克納尼稱：此一行動，由美國陸軍，國務，及財政三部聯合進行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十日電〕麥帥總部今晨十時五十分下令收回美國軍用票，並於事前封鎖日本全部對外電訊，以防洩露消息。麥帥總部財務處預料可在今晚六時前收兌軍　達六千萬美元，嗣後現行軍用票將被認為非法，另發行新軍票以代之。據財務處長羅斯上校宣稱，日本境內雖無偽造美國軍票情事，但日人與其他國人頗有收藏大批軍票之嫌疑。軍方雖曾公佈此項軍票僅供佔領軍人員之用，但聞日人仍從事搜購云</p>
<h3>廣島在復興中　居民十萬死於原子彈</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京九日專電〕首遭原子彈轟炸之廣島，刻正逐漸復興中。宛如「火柴盒」之陋屋，一一興建，草木復生，居民歸來者日衆，以前料將荒蕪多年之廣島，經十六閱月之培養，已「大有生氣」。美方當局吿赴廣島之中國記者團謂：該地居民目前約二百萬，此次戰爭結束時，則達三百萬，死於原子彈者，約十萬之衆。目前雖進行種種復興工作，然廣島居民及一般日本人民，多年內均不至忘却原子彈之威力。</p>
<p>爆炸地區永留紀仿</p>
<p>雷局刻正草擬計劃，闢出傳說原子彈會在其上空爆炸之破壞最烈地方，以警惕日人。往日商業博物館之園地建築物之空榖，迄今猶聳立於該地中央，該建築物在完全夷毀地點之二千公尺距離以內。記者團曾見千年古木一株，該樹為原子彈威力拔根而起，焚燒三日之久。復目賭博物館附近一座因受原子壓力兩面傾倒之鐵橋，欄杆上猶懸有燈籠。</p>
<p>炸後一週枯樹飛昇</p>
<p>尤為驚奇者，即廣島於一九四五年，樹木突自一般認為業已枯槁之地面連根而起，以異常速力衝向天空，凡數日之久，然後飛昇速度遞减，恢復常態。中國記者團訪問紅十字醫院日籍院長竹內時，渠言原子彈爆炸時，渠僅見如火燄之閃光，亦無所聞，頓即不省人事，迄渠復蘇時（渠本在室內），發覺已　臥於庭院中，折斷小骨六根。</p>
<p>遭襲居民死亡比率</p>
<p>其醫院曾救護遭原子彈傷之五萬居民，獎從事鎭密研究後，獲有下列諸結論：（一）凡在爆裂中心零點八八里節圍內，在　外　襲者悉遭難；凡在一點一公里節圍內遭襲者，計有百分之九十點六死亡；凡在二點三公里範圍內者，百分之一點六死亡；凡居於半公里內木屋中者，百分之九十九點九死亡；一公里內者，百分之七五點三死亡。居於鋼骨水泥房屋中之死亡率，遠較居於木屋中者為低；居於距爆炸中心五分之一公里節圍內鋼骨水泥房屋者，計有百分之九十七死亡；居於半公里範圍內者，百分之卅死亡；居於一公里範圍內者，僅百分這六十死亡。某天主教神父所述經過與竹內相合，唯渠稱原子彈並非使日本崩潰之原因，日本人民僅認為此等恐怖武器，為戰爭之一部份。</p>

<h3>印度與印尼　將樹立商務關係</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴達維亞九日電〕印度駐印度尼西亞大使昆當，本日晋謁印尼總統索卡加諾，面呈印度內閣副總理尼赫魯所贈與之書籍，以表示其對於印尼之同情心。昆當並表示印度願與印尼樹立商務關係，印度現有大批織物運往印尼，索卡諾總統當即表示謝意，並謂，一俟環境許可，即前往印度聘問。</p>
<h3>西薩摩亞要求自治</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕聯合國方面人士稱，西薩摩亞島各領袖已請求聯合國託管理事會在紐西蘭保獲下，給予該島完全自治，紐西蘭現為該島代管者。申請書中復要求西薩摩亞與美國保護地東薩摩亞合併，該項請求已分發託管會各理事，將列入本月廿六日首次會議議程。</p>
<h3>墨魔死於共黨手</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬九日電〕義共黨領袖多務里亞蒂頃向「使者報」記者發表談話：證明墨索里尼確係由其命令下屬槍決云。</p>
<h3>印本哲布省猶在支亂中　大炎四起形勢緊張</h3>
<p>〔路透社拉霍爾九日電〕本哲布省拉霍爾平狄城暴動未已，政府已令軍隊對於抗不遵令者格殺勿論。本哲布省其他各處亦均發生動亂。拉霍爾平狄迤北之歐入避署地墨雷今日仍在烈焰焚燒中。官方謂：墨雷已被西北邊省之民衆侵入。官方復謂：吉加加里，古拉加里，吐巴等市塲，以及拉霍爾西北一百六十哩之泰克西拉大學，均在焚燒中。本哲布省總督琴金氏已親赴拉霍爾平狄坐鎭。</p>
<p>同時「反對回印分治行動委員會」今日通令本哲布省之印度教徒及錫克族於星期二實行總罷工一天，以示反對回印分治，但通令明示不得於是日遊行或集會。拉霍爾目前尙屬安定，惟軍警戒備仍不鬆懈。同時因淸道伕役已四日未曾淸掃，故全市蠅羣　築，衛生堪處。當局今日並頒令禁止於八天內在宵禁期間鳴鼓，吹號或使用擴音器，惟祈禱塲所可不受限制。</p>
<p>印獨立同盟反對英政策</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里九日電〕印度獨立鬨盟執行委員會本日開會，當即通過決議對於英國政府宣佈於一九四八年六月以前將政權歸還印度政府一事，加以譴責，並謂：此舉足以引起印度各黨內前意見之紛歧，而發生擾亂，凡我印度人民對於所謂「英人之手法」，應羣起反對云。</p>
<h3>羅素論原子彈</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦九日電〕著名數理哲學家羅素稱：美國獨佔原子彈不能超過五年以上。據渠表示，如欲新科學與世界不遭毀滅，祗有將原子彈交付與世界政府。故吾人對此一新奇之政治軍事組織，必須完全贊同，否則吾人預料將遭遇一超過吾人所能想像之全世界恐怖毀滅災禍。又稱：在五年以內，一切工業化而能獲得充分鈾釷資源之國家皆可製造原子彈。據渠之意見，世界政府產生之途徑有二：較佳之一途徑與各國成立協定，而另一最便捷之途徑，則為由一國獨霸世界造成。世界果如有此獨霸國家出現，則此等國家顯然非美國即蘇聯云。</p>
<h3>敎守登極八週年羅馬將舉行慶祝</h3>

<h3>英美要求調查匈內政　蘇聯已予以拒絕　匈反政府陰謀案多人被捕</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓九日電〕關於蘇聯干涉匈國內政一事，英美兩國業已照會盟國管制匈國委員會蘇聯主席，指斥蘇聯企圖以少數黨之獨裁取現行匈國政府而代之，並提議由英·美·蘇三國共同進行調查匈國國內局勢。頃悉：蘇聯當局已表示拒絕，並謂英美兩國之要求，殆為「不合理之干涉」云。</p>
<p>〔路透社布達佩期九日電〕匈牙利自發現所謂企圖傾覆共和政府建立類似前由霍爾第攝政所領導之政府之陰謀後，已有許多軍政官員及企業鉅子被拘捕。前匈牙利外交部官員史仁蒂文伊及其他被控參預陰謀活動之匈人十二名，已由人民法庭予以審判，史氏在庭上供稱：反動派企圖經由最近被蘇軍逮捕之匈小地主黨秘書柯伐克斯在軍隊及政府內擴充地位，彼等對於未來政府形式尙無固定意見，彼等擬先利用政黨以遂其目的。</p>

<h3>金神父路打浦橋现堍　工業區白晝大火　廠房住家燬數十幢損失浩大無法估計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金神父路打浦橋堍四一〇弄底B．字七七號立德布廠三樓棉紗堆棧昨日下午二時許，忽吿火警，頓時延燒大批棉紗，火勢燎原，剎那間殃及貼隣B．字七八號立興漂染廠，A字七七號明豐絲光廠，七七家庭工業社堆棧，A字七八號該社寫字間及物料間，七九號中國實業染織廠，八〇號惠民藥棉紗布廠，八二號中國實業廠新廠。後經中央泰山等區消防處驅帮浦車多輛趕到灌救，盧家灣警局方面，由趙分局長親率第一二兩衣股長王立言·郝景　·巡官秦伯良·警長郝臣·馬少松·便警李子華等，會同義警隊附王漢生·范用廉，率隊員前往彈壓火塲，維持治安，幷帮同被災廠家住戶搶救貨物。至三時餘，火勢至最高峯，又延燒A字六九號王子靑，七十至七一號李耀昌，七二號陳金山，七三號惠生宿舍，七四號昌興宿舍民房六幢。徐家匯路四七四弄十七號大東南烟廠。則遭受巨大水漬損失，因該廠儲有烟品殊夥。直至五時左右，火勢始煞，惟因尙有餘燼，故直至十時左右，尙留有皮帶車二輛射水。據記者調查所悉，立興，立德，中國，三廠均焚燬殆盡，在塲警員語記者，此次火災，原因有二，（一）弄堂過長，距離馬路太平龍頭較遠，接水灌救費時。（二）工廠堆置柴油甚多，雖經警員竭力搬出不少，然一部份柴油，已遭燃及，火勢乃不可收拾。消防員當時因龍頭內水量不敷吸用，再接打外面日暉港內河水補充。又謂該保保長姚昭武，因急於帮同他人搶搬物件致犧牲自己財產，値得表揚。至此次之損失，房屋焚去數十幢外，其他貨品等一時無法估計，總之其數字當極為龐大云。</p>
<p>又當大火時，有一襪廠學徒倪玉堂，自屋項逃命，失足跌下受傷，口吐鮮血，即經消防救護人員急送醫院醫治。</p>

<h3>童工發給差金貼補三分之一認為合理　吳開先表示意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勞資評斷會前議決生活指數凍結後，二月份差額金之貼補，童工（包括學徒藝徒養成工等）擬以三分之一發給。日前市參議會開會時，三區棉舫業請願要求童工應一律待遇。社會局長吳開先昨對此表示意見稱：童工普通皆僅為輔助手，並非家庭主要負組者，故差額不發固屬不合，發三分之一，較為合理（因該項日用品之差額，係以三口之家計算）。雖有若干童工因父死或母死而須員一家生活之責，但此究屬少數。</p>
<p>又香烟業，織帶業等，因一部份資方不遵照勞資評斷會議決之辦法發給差金，職工乃於昨日向社會局呈訴。該局將嚴令資方執行。</p>
<h3>上海交通之壞　見所未見　無錢難着手專家作苦笑　建築地道　認為絕不可能</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者於昨日走訪最近應聘來華協助改善本市交通之美籍公用專家康惠博士（見圖），詢以對於本市之交通現狀，有意見何？彼苦笑曰：「甚壞」，並稱：生平從未看見任何城市之三輪車及人力車，擁擠如上海者。記者詢以人力車之過多，是否係本市交通紊亂之最大原因，而須加以取締？渠稱：目前尙不能回答。記者又詢以對於改進本市交通，已擬就具體辦法吾？康惠博士稱：彼並未自美國帶任何計劃來，蓋純屬理論之抽象計劃，決不能配合上海現實環境。渠之任務乃考察上海之交通現狀，作綜合性之研究，發掘其癥結所在，然後對症下藥，提出具體之辦法，呈市政府作為改進交通之參考。渠稱：來華四五小時後，即赴各區視察，昨晨並參觀本市電車公司，與高級負責人員作檢討性之談話。彼等今後之初步工作，仍為織續衫察各公用事業機構，作為研討之基本資料。</p>
<p>有軌電車將被淘汰</p>
<p>康惠博士吿記者稱：美國現時之三大交通工具為：電車，無軌電車及公共汽車。而近年來有軌電車已有逐漸被淘汰之趨勢。彼稱：上海或亦將採取是項趨勢，蓋有軌電車已成為現時代之落後工具，乃屬事實也。且彼知現時上海市長，對於有軌電車並不滿足，故此一問題，甚有研究之價值。</p>
<p>記者詢以欲解決上海之交通問題，　築「地道」是否善策？康惠博士之回答　為乾脆，彼稱：「絕不可能」。蓋築地道一哩。需美金五百萬至六百萬元，上海市政府無錢，地道從何築起？渠認為地道雖可解決一部分交通問題，因地下火車其快無比，惜費用過於昂貴，目前談之尙嫌過早</p>
<p>街道太狹拆屋困難</p>
<p>對於本市之多數街道，康惠博士認為確屬太狄，致影響交通甚鉅。然彼深切明暸，此問題一時尙不能解決，因若拆屋重建，一則必將擾亂市民安寗，二則市府無此龐大經費。若取自市民，因而增加市民負担，決非目前所能行得通。</p>
<p>最後康惠博士稱：總之須於充分明暸上海之交通情形後，再向市府建議具體改善辦法，務使今後之上海交通，步向比較合理，且比較文明。渠稱：「使車輛在馬路土跑得快一點，識人們可以早點回家！」</p>

<h3>殺人惡魔黑澤審結　在杭時作惡不勝枚舉　證據確鑿尙圖抵賴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日本戰犯黑澤次男，前為杭州日軍招撫班指專員，淪陷時期恣意殺人，罪大惡極。昨由第一綏靖區軍事法庭開庭審訊，定於本月十七日下午二時宣判。</p>
<p>黑澤次男係東京早稻田大學畢業生，民國二十六年八月廿三日應征入伍，翌年八月隨同軍隊來華，編入日本第二十二師團土橋部隊出村聯隊駐紮杭州，二十九年八九月間滿級退役以後，又受土橋部隊參謀部「囑託」担任情報工作，同時組織招撫工作班，即陷區人民所稱之黑澤部隊，由被吿領導，下設一總隊三大隊，人數衆多，有步檢四百餘支，短槍一百餘支，機槍十餘架，經常駐紮杭州筧橋艮山門七堡彭家埠硤石許村一帶，流竄所及，遠至金華蘭谿。自二十九年十一月三日成立以後，第二月即開始屠殺五人，此後每月殺人一二次不等，共計屠殺一百二十餘人。現有家屬可查者，為已死之楊小毛兪堂春兪全根麻皮老虎等四人。又黑澤部隊曾於北魚潭聖帝殿楊童生所種菜地上殺害五六十人，其中一部份用刀劈害，有當時被迫掩埋殺害屍將之　民周少俊可為證明。民國三十年，又連續屠殺二十七人，均葬於北魚潭，又陸子卿等被殺一寧內有女子一人，由被吿親搖機關槍殺害，其中一人中槍未死，由被吿將其活埋，此係當時被迫埋葬屍體之章阿根親自所諸。前我方代理杭州縣長蘇融和亦曾被捕，綁至艮山門外臨刑時，倖被釋回，渠曾目賭有中國士兵多人被綁在塲，被吿部隊則携有箕　等掩埋之具。至於我方軍政人員被殺可稽攷者，有抗日自衛分隊長唐茂林，第十集團軍情報員沈培增等四十餘名。黑澤部隊分駐於杭縣縣境者，紀律廢弛，殺人放火，姦淫擄掠，作惡更不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>勝利以後，該犯匿居杭州日僑管理處，經浙江高等法院檢察處捕獲偵訊，並派檢察官赴艮山門外刑人之地勘騐，發掘出屍骨較完整者六十一具，經法醫鑑定結果，認為刀砍致死者十八具，以鈍物打擊致死者十三具，以槍殺致死者十七具，活埋致死者八具。該犯旋由浙江高檢處會同衢州綏靖公署解送軍事法庭，正式以戰犯起訴。</p>
<p>昨日庭上根據黑澤在浙江高檢處之口供（其中承認奉參謀部命令殺害三十餘人）嚴詞審結，並出示掘得屍骨之照片，刑場地圖及法舊檢定書等，但該犯竟推翻前供，一口否認。最後由檢察官及辯護律師辯諭後，庭諭十七日宣判。黑澤昨衣黑色西服，鼻架玳瑁眼鏡，文質彬彬，乍視之下，殊不料其為一殺人魔王也。</p>

<h3>國定課本　七聯繼續印供</h3>
<p>成本飛漲翻版絕跡</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本期國定本中小學教科書印供情形因開放版權息公布，故各地翻版之風甚盛。但近日紙價印盯工價飛漲，課本售價，教部採取限價政策，隨同一月份生活費指數一併凍結，祗准照定價九十四倍實售。所有售價收入，以供直接造本，尙屬不敷甚遠。於是各地翻版者突然中止進行，其已廉價購進紙張者，亦囤紙不再印書。教部有鑒於此，曾特通知七聯處，在本年六月以前，仍望該處全部負責供應。聞七聯處原定辦法，本照各省市教育統計數字，定量配運，以迭受翻版物價交通軍事等重重影響，無法調劑盈虛，截長補短，故一部分區域存書纍纍，一部分區域仍感書荒。七聯處近日為勉應部令，對國定本曲盡最後之義務起見，特於前月杪再增印一千餘萬册，以接濟東北魯省蘇北及其他缺書地帶，中原交通阻斷，特與中航公司接洽，空運前往。各書現已出齋，並配有教學指引。各地如有缺書，可向該處上海各家配購，實售價仍僅為定價之九十四倍云。</p>

<h3>自費留學生　將控宋貝二氏提出理由三點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市第二屆自費留學生，於去年十一月低派代表晋京請願，要求以舊匯率結算外匯，不得要領。旋又於本年二月十八日再度請願，當時政院宋院長允於二週後答覆，殊不知於請願三日後中央即命令停止發給護照，後宋院長及央行總裁，均相繼辭職，致二次請願，又未獲結果。該屆自費留學生大為憤慨，以宋前院長及貝前總裁，不實行諾言，使千餘學子蒙受極大損失，頃經決定，由該屆自費留學生聯名提出正式呈訴書，根據合法手續，向監察院要求彈劾宋貝二氏，同時進行行政訴訟。</p>
<p>茲據自費留學生同學會副主席凌霜昨吿記者稱，該同學會對彈劾及控訴宋貝二民之理由有三：（一）去年七月教部舉行自費留學考試，此乃國家旣定政策，應予執行，乃宋氏反是，不予考取同學申請舊匯率結匯現且停止發給護照，意即不准出國，共反覆矛盾措施失當，即為失職之一。（二）自費留學生考試放榜後，同學請求按舊匯率結匯，第一次請願，宋院長·貝總裁·及各部均互相推諉，宋且明知匯率將變更而置之不理，致同學蒙受經濟上極大損失，此其失職之三。（三）當第一屆自費留學考試後，政府有明令規定，以後未經教部考試者，不得出國，同學等均知遵守國家法令，然據教部統計，在第一屆及第二屆之間，未經考試出國者，計一千餘人。同時宋院長本人三女兒，及總裁三兒子，均未經考試而私擅出國。宋貝自頒法令而抵觸法令，實乃凟職。</p>
<p>現該自費留學生同學會，正延聘律師專家準備起訴手續，不日並將發表正式呈訴書。一方面則仍請宋具二氏繼續向新改組政府要求三三五〇匯率結匯，並恢復發給出國護照，如不獲允許將要求二氏賠償各同學全部考試費及三三五〇至一萬二千匯率間各人費用之全部差額。據云有一部同學，自遠地趕來參加考試，甚至離家棄職，現不能出國，費用告罄，極感流浪之苦云。</p>

<h3>台杯選手蔡惠全參加香港綱球賽　定於三月十日開始</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕一年一度的香港公開網球比賽，自一九四一年以後，一連停賽了五年。去年雖告復員，但港中網球好手，不是作客他鄉，還禾返港，就是久疏練習，不便出賽，所以遲到今年，才繼續正式舉行。當網球賽開始報名的時候球界中人紛紛猜測，我國參加台維斯杯選手蔡惠全是否也來凑凑熱鬧？以目前港中的網球人材而諭，蔡惠全當可獨佔鰲頭，但徐氏昆仲惠培潤培，也是個中能手，曾獲一九四一年的本港綱球冠軍，此外江道章，何家鎏，李惠堂，都是一時俊傑，而江道章也是台維斯杯的宿將，外籍網球能手，有印度人林氏兄弟（小林珍大林珍），頗負時譽，本屆報名的，還有若干英國軍官，他們的球藝，還未在本港球界露險，到底有何本領，現在尙難推斷，但無論如何，這塲此賽的冠軍，總是中華男兒的囊中物，綠眼兒休想染指。報名參加單打賽者，共三十九人，雙打賽者，廿九對，定於三月十日開始比賽。屆時香港木球總會的綠茵草上，又將有劇烈的競爭。網球賽在香港人眼中，認為「大檯客」的玩意，不比足球的上下同好，雅俗共賞，但港中的網球能手，還是人材輩出，水準似超過京滬之上。但不及京滬方面的通俗化，這是美中不足的地方。蔡惠全最近因商務關係，原定赴英一行，假如事屬逼迫，無法推延，那麽，他還是無法參加這次比賽的。</p>

<h3>統債挺升</h3>
<p>公債昨終告上挺，統丙晨開八八〇〇元，即吿爭買，盤高至一〇三〇〇元而後稍盤，暗市喊高至一〇五〇〇元，結果較上週六計甲乙升一千二，丙漲一千三，丁升二千元，戊漲一千七，成交約五百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>八種公債抽籤還本</h3>
<p>補付逾期本息月底截止</p>
<p>財政部昨在仁記路七十四號四樓舉行公債還本抽籤，計有民國廿五年統一公債乙種債票，十七年金融長期公債，廿五年整理廣東金融公債，廿五年四川善後公債，廿六年　濬廣東省港河工程美金公債，廿八年建設公債第一期債票，廿八年軍需公債第二期債票，及卅年軍需公債第三期債票等八種公債，所有中籤債票應還本金，除廿六年闢濬廣東省港河工程美金公債，因指定該項還本付息基金之粵海關附加稅，前被敵刦持，未能照解，本息暫緩兌付，俟該債基金淸理完竣，再行另訂恢復償還日期外，餘各種債票本息即依照各該債條例原訂償付日期，由各地中中交農四銀行暨中央信託局辦理兌付手續。又據陳司長當塲報吿，收復區內各種公債持票人，在抗戰期中因格於形勢，間有未能依照規定三年期限兌取本息者，財政部為顯全持票人利益，前經宣佈特准於上年底前辦理補付，逾期不領，則照章作廢無效。嗣徇各銀行之請求，又將補付期限展至本年三月底止，現此項補付期限即將屆滿，希望各持票人注意。</p>
<h3>私人申請外匯一概不予受理</h3>
<p>中央銀行外匯審核處頃通函各指定經營外匯銀行，規定嗣後對於私人名議申請外匯，不得受理。又委託銷售之輸出品出口商，應於規定期間內，將外匯結售於指定銀行云。</p>
<h3>對日易貨交涉　除窰木及人造絲外希望大量供給報紙</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前行政院派赴日本接洽易貨事宜之專員，日內即返國。截至此時為止，日本已允供給我國窰木四百萬根，人造絲三百萬磅，我國允供給日本食鹽一百萬噸，但是否能如數供應，現尙不能斷言。白報紙為我國迫切需要之貨物，希望日本能大量供給，但據有關人士表示：日本在盟軍總部指導之下，正進行教育「民主化」之工作，舊教科畫已予廢棄，新教科書正趕印中，本身需要大量之白報紙，故是否能有剩餘出口，殊為疑問，現已運至我國者僅五百領。闢於我國最迫切急　之大量火車頭及車身，因我國不能以大　之煤鐵原料供給日本，短期內尙難成事實，惟少量之零星供給仍屬可能。</p>
<p>又訊：對蘇易貨為我國償還戰時債務之行為，共分兩部：一為資源委員會之　砂，另一種為中信局輸出之普通物資，如桐油猪　等。去年中信局償還蘇聯之貨物價僅，計達一千零五萬美金，本年內擬償還之數字，尙在請示階段，並在徵求蘇方之同意，但據有關人士之表示：因我國目前經濟情况不佳，今年之償還額不致超過去年。又此項償還工作，將繼續至一九五二年為止。</p>

<h3>警局奉命取締黑市　華股市塲漲風瀰漫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股昨仍在各路游資吸納中，引起空方抵補仍趨俏利，塲外黑市，警局已奉命採取斷然措施，即將開始行動，嚴屬取締，午後雖有多方獲利出籠而下挫，但雜牌秀氣未泯，臨收再被提高。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>見高，開後一九六號八五號一九八號趁高脫手降為三〇四〇元。一五二號八五號八九號一八〇號一五四號趁低維持，逐步拉高，中法首先漲停，八九號一五二號三六號均進胃不斷遞永紗乃漲到三一五〇元。一四號一〇五號一二九號一三號趁高脫手退至三一〇〇元內。惟國貨由一〇六號，商務由一六九號掛高至漲停，人心見秀，八九號二一三號三二號一八〇號九四號一九九號八五號一四號一〇二號紛購，買風又起，現遞美亞，水泥，內衣，中絲，統益，永公紛紛漲達限度，遞永紗又升至三二九〇元。一五二號一二一號一五五號逢高脫手，回降至三二三〇元。一九八號一九七號三五號九四號趁勢再進。十一時半，終於穿出三三〇〇元大關，漲到三三三〇元。二〇七號一七一號一八〇號二三一號逢高了結，又降低至三一三〇元。六一號一四號七六號有納，午收站三二七〇元。結果較上週六收市計永紗信和美亞勤興各升一成，中法新華漲停，新光華體微升，景福平平，遞交永紗信和美亞勤興各漲一成，華豐新光升半成左右，景福徽升，冷股永公統益大通中絲商務火柴國貨麗安水泥新亞內衣均吿漲停，九福平定而祗一筆成交，餘升半成迄一成不等。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>一〇五號二〇〇號一三號二三五號八三號一六〇號五七號一一二號四號九一號紛紛售出而盤跌至三一二〇元，八九號一七一號一一二號均有維持，曾升至三一七〇元，一九二號一一二號三二號二二三號二二四號二一九號仍有賣出，遞永紗遂再被迫低至三〇七〇元左右，一八一號一七七號一五二號一一二號一八〇號二三一號趁低來進，始回升至三二〇〇元，此際各雜牌股票紛再漲停，足見人心仍榮，雖有九一號四號力售，但臨收時八四號一一七號一五六號八九號二一九號紛加買進，收市仍拉高至三二九〇元。收後喊價更抬高至三三四〇元，傳一千八百倍升值辦法即當實行之說，結果較上週六計永紗信和美亞　興各升一成强，中法新華漲停，新光景　升半成弱，華　搬升，遞交永紗信和美亞勤興各　一成及一成有零，新光　　微升，冷股榮豐統益大通中絲商務火　　貨五和永公　安水泥內衣漲停，餘看除九福外均升少許迄一或不等，塲外各股平穩少變。</p>
<h3>外股盤旋向上</h3>
<p>外股昨盤旋而漲，西商仍在吸納橡皮股，鋼業未見議健，航　等則見俏較多，結果較上週六計怡啤升半成，紙業航業各漲一成弱，鋼業徵挫，餘者微升而已。</p>
<h3>報紙進口限額太少　每月實需八千餘噸現定限客僅三千噸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕白報紙行市，週前美令曾達十三萬元。近日來以價高銷滯，故價又逐步回疲，大致徘徊在十萬〇五千元至十一萬元之間。捲筒白報紙以磅計，每磅為二千一百元。據本市某大外商進口紙行息：該行每月向美運來白報紙約三千噸，均係代客定貨，每令合六萬元，捲筒紙每磅合一千二百元，以上價格，均已包括運輸費，進出口關稅，保險費等在內。惟定貨至交貨期間利息之耗損，則不在內。又默洲白報紙之上海碼頭交貨價（不計利息耗損），每令則已合九萬元。據估計民國廿六年時，本市全年報紙之進口量，約為十萬噸，美月約合八千三百餘噸。而目前本市每月報紙進口限額，僅合三千噸，離開實際需要遠甚。渠推算目前本市之需要量，每月至少需七千噸。且設外埠交通一且恢復，則客帮採辦必殷，需要量更將龐大。估計目前本市白報紙之存量，大致可用三個月。而目前國人紙廠之白報紙生產成本，每磅須達二千五百元，與國外之定貨價，相差幾達一倍，生產結果，頗不經濟，故暫時治標辦法，似應從考慮放寬紙類之進口限額着想云。</p>
<h3>押滙銀團　第一組已成立　和成華康等七家簽立合約</h3>
<p>中央銀行為使商業行莊因扶助生產事業，而所需資金得有週轉之機會起見。特辦理重貼現轉質押，由商業行莊組織工商貸款銀團方式辦法，本市商業行莊所組織之銀團，曾達十餘組之多，共貸出九十餘億，均以原放款額七五折向中央銀行重貼現或轉質押，該行並為較勵物資流通起見，復根據所訂辦法，辦理轉押匯，仍由商業行莊組織押匯銀團，向中央銀行申請轉押匯。據悉：川帮銀行美豐·和成·通惠·華康·濟康·農工·匯通等七家，已將第一組押匯銀團組織完成，並正式簽訂合約。該銀團之任務，係負審核各項貸款，並轉商中央銀行允予轉押匯之責，銀團團員押匯貨物，必須以民生日用必需品，當地特產出口物賽為限，並須負責保證該項貸款完全為各該債務人之工商業正當需要，絕無移作其他用途情事。每一團員提交銀團之債權，以國幣四億元為最高額，轉押匯以七五折計算，即國幣三億元為限，團員貸款工商業，每戶總額不得超過國幣一億元，貸款利率月息五分，限期三十天，押匯貨物折扣，照起運地市價最高七拆計算，銀團對中央銀行所負債務，係由全體團員負連帶責任，該銀團即與中央銀行訂立轉押匯合約。</p>
<h3>食油繼續配售</h3>
<p>據食油聯配處消息，該處對本週零售油商號配油，經與油廠商定，繼續供應，聞市中區配油，決定本月十二日申請配購，每號可配售豆油一桶，每担價仍為廿五萬元云。</p>
<p>（又訊）中國植物油料廠續配生油與本市商號，配給號數為丙組四〇一至六〇〇號，於昨（十）日繳款，配價每桶九十萬九千五百元，定今（十一）日提貨云。</p>
<h3>米市客銷呆滯　豆油價回落萬元</h3>
<p>昨日南北市共到米糧一萬四千六百餘石客銷冷懈市况呆滯，形勢一蹶不振。粳米步跌二一千元，中下續瀉二三千元。秈米亦疲一二千元。白元高定次削，陰元挫落一二千元，成交極軍，暫難向榮。麵粉以配粉照常供應，內地來貨尙有逐步下游，再低三四百至千元不一。麩皮堅定，油市開靑島將有貨到申，人心轉軟，一致下降。豆油回落萬元，生油猛落萬餘元，淸油亦隨之跟小三五千元，蔴油跌萬元。</p>
<p>黃豆平定之局，豆餅汕頭納胃淸淡，市面平平。菉豆彷彿，紅糧早堅午淡，軋升千元。苞米開盤猛漲，午時轉平，結果盤漲三四千元。生仁去胃呆木，續疲三四千元。芝蔴挺定，蠶豆實銷尙殷，價形穩定，赤豆平庸。</p>
<h3>細紗喊價堅俏</h3>
<p>昨日紗市平靜如恒，客銷固仍寥寥，人心尙無疲軟之象，尤以三十二支細紗，因有單純織廠需要，價乃獨俏，塲內買賣固遵限價，然交頭接耳之交易仍屬難免焉。</p>
<p>棉布市況疲軟</p>
<p>昨員棉布市况，因日來出口裝船噸位不多，一部份貨色擱淺，客帮辦胃亦呆，同業以拆息關係，拋貨甚夥。而紡建公司週六供售布疋，一律予申購者以全數照給，以致現貨充斥，塲中喊價疲軟。十二磅龍頭細布價十五萬六千元，五福十五萬三千五百元，較前日各檔布價軋小自一千元至三千元，色布及士林布則鮮上落，僅跳鯉漂布本街略有進胃，獨稍挺秀。</p>
<h3>呢羢西服店訂購白帆布</h3>
<p>呢羢交易因價昂及種種關係，致實地需銷，遠較往年斯時為寡。一般貨主因進貨困難，兼貨物稅已實行征收，人心始終向上。　寬三十六英寸之　產白帆布，邇來呢羢與西服二帮大有訂定，由培豐公司經手定出者，共計有四百餘疋，定煩每碼九千元，一價月內交　。定洋每疋一律先付十二萬元。</p>
<h3>油臘升沉不一</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今市椰油牛油又吿上揚，柏油產地報漲，滬市仍雜原盤。椰十油做開復每担為四十五萬元，蚌埠牛油，本淘牛油，美担為四十四萬至四十五萬元不等。嘉興本車每担為三十五萬元，蘭谿·威坪·柏油每坦為卅萬至卅一萬元。麻城·荆柏·拆雪無甚做開，開柏油產地價格，均已報漲。</p>
<h3>靑許菸葉砌升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑州，許州，菸葉，以阨於運輸，到貨甚稀，二日以來，價格齊步飛颺。胥州上等業子每磅七千五百元，中等七千元，許州上等每磅七千二百元，中等六千七百元，均較上日上漲。美菸仍站原盤，自美金七角至一元三角不等。</p>
<h3>肥皂廠盤騰踊　各廠派貨甚多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近肥皂市况，穩中帶疲。固本肥皂聞派出總數為二萬箱，廠盤為廿一萬元，剪刀派貨約三千箱，廠盤為廿一萬元。祥苊派貨不多，總數一度盛傳為五萬箱，後聞亦祗派出五六千箱，廠盤為十五萬五千元。南陽此次開派木桶脚皂，派價為三萬元，廠盤為四萬元。近來油碱價格雖已下瀉，但各肥皂廠，依照目前廠盤，亦僅夠維持生產成本</p>
<h3>煙焼跌途後回漲</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤屑，因實銷戶逢低頻吸，市况遂稍轉堅，價乃急遽回升。嗣因賣戶喊價過高，進戶還價難以接近，僅零星急用者略有照市抵補，大批交易仍頗寥落。白煤塊焦作車站有到貨，市便亦見回平。其他各貨供求尙平，市價亦鮮變動。</p>
<h3>中信昨配售二期人造絲</h3>
<p>中信局代售政行財產委員會昨（十）日配售本月份第二期絲織業人造絲，此次配售為早日，高山，東洋，金三馬，天橋等牌，價格仍照舊，配售數量約為六百箱左右云。</p>
<h3>工鑛事業調整資本辦法補充估算方法即將公佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部於去年十二月廿八日公佈『工礦運輸事業重估固定資產價值調整資本辦法』以後，因尙須加以補充，得使各廠商有所遵循，曾由本市會計師公會積極研討，提供意見，而由財經兩部擬就『補充估算方法』，日內即將經行政院會議，加以討論後，公佈實施，茲向有關方面探得其全部草案如下：</p>
<p>一，辦法第一條所稱『固定資產』，包括土地建築物機械設備模型工具儀器傢具暨船舶車輛等</p>
<p>投資股份之其有永久性而在其所投資之事業之資本已經調整者，應依其調整後之股額列計，不應在本事業再行估價，但因時間關係，不克久待其所投資事業之資本調聲者，得照該項投資股票，在民國二十五年十二月內可以變現傻值之四分之一，為其重估價之最高限額。（未完）</p>

<h3>廣州春節　联歡　硬彥粉墨登場　名媛服裝表演　張奎夫人扮小宛　胡木小姐演為國爭光</h3>
<p>— 廣州二日航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>三月一日黃昏過後，空中正糧着霏霏春雨，大地上一片淸團寂靜；祗有宏偉壯麗的中山紀念堂裏，擠滿了人，悠揚的樂聲，和笑聲掌聲混成一片，熟鬧情况空前；這是廣州市黨員春節聯歡的大會，到會的除了黨政軍機關的首長，還有全市的黨員，濟濟一堂，融融洽治，有如父老兄弟姊妹，在一個大家庭裏一般，親愛和樂之情，充滿了偌大的塲所，這眞是勝利復員後，一個罕有的盛會。</p>
<p>大會的節目，不單豐富異常，而且別開生面；最難得的，就是本市的碩彥名流也粉墨登塲演劇，尤具特色的，就是由張主任發奎夫人劉景容，羅主席卓英夫人陳輝靑，和歐陽市長夫人易韞端三位領導名媛數十參加的古代現代服裝表演。古代服裝表演節目，由「秦」起以至「淸」止，每代選出一個婦女做代表人物，計「秦」是西施，「前漢」是昭君，「後漢」是貂蟬，「唐」是楊貴妃，「宋」是梁紅玉，「元」是花木蘭，「明」是費宮人，「淸」是董小宛；她們扮演着道幾個不同年代的人物，依次出塲，有些衣飾輝煌，有些淡裝　抹，五光十色，不一而足；將觀衆的心情，帶到了歷史的境地；一會兒現代服裝表演，才又將人帶回這個原子時代的世界。</p>
<p>張發奎主任夫人在歷代服裝表演中，她担任扮演淸朝的董小宛，穿了粉紅色的淸裝登台，博得台下的喝彩至爲熟烈，其餘市參議長陸幼剛夫人的現代服裝表演，也獲得不少的掌聲。服裝表演過後，還有一個精彩的節目，就是由伍智梅，羅蠶羣，馮次洪，睦幼剛，高信，祝秀俠，胡木蘭等合演的「爲國爭光」兩幕劇，劇中以演　　國的爲最出色，這角色是由中委而兼敎育局長的祝秀俠扮演，劇中人的個性把握得很穩，他本人大約四十左右，他却扮演這個銀鬚　髮的老翁，那種龍鍾的態度，眞是維肖維妙，可算是劇中演出最成功的一個；共餘中委伍智梅扮演的學夫人，也獲得相當的好評。</p>
<p>在這個盛會裏，使人有一個强烈的感覺，就是先進一利後輩打成一片，那裏固然有不少德高望重的黨政要人，但也有更多活潑天眞年靑的夥子，他們在一個主義一個目的之下，打破了年齡老稚和資望深淺的界域，充份表現出親愛精誠；所以這個雖然是聯歡大會，但除了達到共同娛樂的目的之外，實在還有深長意義的！</p>
<p>大會中之精彩節目：古裝表演</p>
<p>（由右至左）張主任發奎夫人—淸：董小宛。陳若　—秦：西施。陳　姬—元：花木蘭。馮淑英—前漢：王昭君。陳嘉斌夫人—唐：楊貴妃。陳倫—後漢：貂蟬。梁省常—宋：梁紅玉。張夫人—明：費宮人。（李景開攝贈）</p>
<h3>淮南鐵路春意濃</h3>
<p>— 九龍崗八日快訊　蟄松</p>
<p>淮南鐵路，現在行車的部份，雖然長僅八十餘公里，爬伏在皖省東北的一隅，可是他所負的使命，並不在隣路津浦綫，和冠蓋如雲，負販如蟻的京滬綫之下，牠每天要拖着淮南煤礦所產的煤斤，到達蚌埠轉運南下，去供給交通和工業的燃料。至刦後餘生，窮困已甚的皖北皖中一帶人民，因爲有牠整日在送往迎來，得以便捷吐納他們的土產和日用必需品，沿綫凋敝的農村，也都漸漸地活躍了。</p>
<p>淮路在日敵所留下的，祗有遍體創傷的一個脆弱軀殼，復又遭受着人禍天災的侵蝕，—乘火打刦者的破壤，和去秋迭决水患的冲刷，—但，人定足可勝天，終於靠着局長吳競淸氏的勞身焦思，全體員工一年來的瘁力工作，在環境特殊，物力缺乏種種艱困之下，細心而奮勇地對症下藥，針灸頻施，起罷　，肉白骨，使牠得以負起鉅大的使命。</p>
<p>合肥至水家湖　公路聯運</p>
<p>合肥，是戰後安徽的省會，安徽省公路局就利用淮路水家潮到裕溪口長約一百八十餘公里的原有路基，作爲臨時公路，但是車輛不多，難以供應事實的需求，淮路當局爲協助發展交通起見，就和交通部公路總局商妥合辦水家湖至合肥，合肥至裕溪口的公路聯運，車輛由公路總局供給，於上年十月十日開辦，行車有定時，乘客有定座，　隊密管理之下，行旅都感覺便利多多了。</p>
<p>水家湖：是公路與鐵路的交接站，但地非市集，除子少數應運而生的零食攤販，和幾間茅頂，柴扉，土墻，泥地，廚則相混的飯舖外，便找不到稍爲整潔可餐可息的菜館行臺了，淮路除已致力於「行」的方面外，並爲候車旅客解決「食」「休」的兩大難題，在新建水家潮站屋之旁，另闢數間作爲招待所，雇用名廚，經常供給飯菜點心，並備糖果零食，以使選購，主管招待所事務的施靜昌君，招待週到，侍應生亦各彬彬有禮，使旅客忘却了征途的疲勞，待車的煩悶，大有「賓至如蹄」之樂，一進招待所，顯露在旅客眼裏的，便是吳局長手題「勤廉知恥」對從業負工的訓示，這，不使顯示着准路奉行新生活運動的精神，於此更可見淮路在短短一年的過程中，而有此成就，絕非偶然。</p>
<p>張主席凌次長　冠蓋往來</p>
<p>春，畢竟已到人間了，雖然還不免於「春寒料峭」，但己不似北風凜冽的可怕了，淮路因地較偏僻，絕少冠蓋的往來，可是在最近先後到了西北行轅主任兼新疆省政府主席張文伯將軍，和交通部决長凌竹銘先生，田兩位帶給淮路不少的春意，更覺得春氣盎然。</p>
<p>張將軍於百忙中偕了夫人等回到故鄕巢縣，故的雖好，但身　重寄的張將軍，却不許他多有留戀，又於十八日依依不捨地離別了家鄕，而到現時安徽省會的合肥，在合肥居留一天，二十日晨仍由汪廳長陪同乘坐汽車向水家湖前進，先一天蚌埠市長李品和氏及綏靖區政治部主任邱國珍氏等就到了水家湖迎候，當張將軍的汽車馳到水家潮時，淮路爲張將軍所備的專車，——一輛該路機廠自造，設備精美，佈置整潔的頭等車，——已掛在一〇八號機車後面，該路吳局長等亦已先到，十一時餘，精神健旺，態度慈祥的張將軍，偕同夫人抵站，下軍後與歡迎人員一一握手，表示謝意，隨即被擁入招待室，吳局長首先請他到九龍崗去參觀指導，張將軍很客氣地以職務和時間的不許可，而歉悵地婉辭了，但是對於淮路，在他讚許和垂詢的談話中，可以知道他是十二分的關切，隨由路局招待午餐後，於十二時四十分即向大衆握手告別而與蚌合兩地迎送的諸人，登車離站，兩點四十分，這列淮路處女行的貴賓專車，即到遠蚌埠。</p>
<p>次長僕鳳塵　視察淮南</p>
<p>接着是淮路得到交通部次長凌竹銘氏將出發視察津浦隴海淮南各路的消息，這在淮南路上，又是一個足資描寫的鏡頭。二十三日淮路即由副局長寗樹藩氏率工機兩處處長，乘車赴蚌歡迎，並便於沿路指陳一切，翌晨，凌次長隨員等曁津浦路副局長兼浦兗段管理處處長沈文泗氏，由津浦北段視察南返蚌埠，專車進站，寗副局長等當即趨迎，專車隨就倒入淮路月台，並加掛淮路的頭等車，這一列車，有淮南的頭等客車，津浦的臥車，隴海的公事軍，和四面破窗的特種車，集合了三路不同的車輛，這足以象徽着三路「交」流而「通」暢，更明白指示着凌氏這次視察的途程，專車改由淮路機車拖引，於六時半開行，凌氏精神煥發，雖通日僕僕風塵，但絕無倦意。道次視察各路，與復興交通的國策，關係自必很大，所以淮路當局，和許多員工，對凌氏的來臨，無不表示着十分的戌奮，而抱有「其將有以利吾路乎」的希冀。爲了參觀的順序及時間計，專車即直駛淮路終點淮南岸的田家菴。</p>
<p>田家庵大通礦　欣欣向榮</p>
<p>田家菴原是一個鄕鎭，自淮路通車後，頓爲永陸要道，商賈薈萃，日漸繁榮，形成淮河沿岸的新興市鎭了。倫陷期內，因爲淮南礦路被敵利用，居留人民，雖在兇威壓迫下度其非人的生活，但此地仍未失其重要性，勝利後，八年的流浪者，紛紛來歸，更見欣欣向榮，皖十區專員公署，上年奉令移設於此，關於發展市政，由專署主持，並召集地方人士及淮南路礦當局，會商規劃，正在逐步實施中。淮路原有的站屋，僅此地及大通九龍崗三處僥倖保存。在站的西南面，巍然竪立了兩棟高大廠屋，一是淮南發電廠，日夜不斷的供給大通九龍崗礦路各部份工作塲所的電力及各處的電燈，另一棟是成立不久的淮南麵粉廠，以出品供給碾路員工。這都是淮南礦路公司的當局，慘淡經營，爲着促進礦路發展和地方繁榮的一番建設，凌次長分別參觀後，備加讚許，十時半專車折回大通。</p>
<p>大通煤礦，在戰前是大通煤礦公司所經營，題九龍崗近五公里，戰後淮南大通兩礦合併，就屬於淮南煤礦局主要礦塲之一，一切設備，在敵人侵佔時期，都改觀了。敵人意在急擭煤斤，開採工程，多不合理，所以接收以後，礦局很費了一番勞苦整修的工作，現在產量已日漸增多，凌次長每參觀一塲所，經程總經理和礦局的副局長李境胡師童兩氏等，將各部門工作情形，詳爲陳述，凌氏很是重視而關切。</p>
<p>給九龍崗機廠　新的啟示</p>
<p>十一時二十分返抵九龍崗車站。分乘小吉普車駛向招待所，稍事休息，即舉行公宴，在歡悅的氣氛中，賓主舉杯互祝，大家談話的中心，離不了淮南路礦過去的經過，未來的計劃，尤其是水家湖到裕溪口鐵路復軌的問題，凌决長因淮路與國營民營各交通建成及工業等事業，均有休戚相關的關係，所以很熟忱而坦白地指示一切，且允予可能範圍內的扶助，並於公宴席上，與沈副局長均有致詞，一時除即由程總經理吳局長等引導參觀辦公室，這是一所雄視淮南礦路區域的房子，但現在礦路兩局長司，隨業務進展而日漸增加，已經不够分配了，所以路局的工務機務兩處和總務車務的各一部份，都分在其他房子裏辦公。</p>
<p>出了辦公室轉進路局九能崗機廠，廠長柳新民君，年靑神煥，從他的談話中，可知道是一位頭腦淸新，實幹硬幹的機械工程人材。據柳廠長的報告：得知該廠接收時房屋不全，殘破穠件堆築滿地，全部機器能應用的僅有三分之一，經一年來的整理修配，現已全部可用。接收的初期，機廠設備和材料等等，都極凌亂，後將工作部門予以調整，分爲總務，會計，材料，工作四股，機車，車輛，鑄工，鍛工，鍋爐，電工，機工等七工作塲，現有職負五十一人，技工小工共四百七十八人，當參觀的時候，各工作塲所的工人，都在很忙地各司其事，一所偉大的機車塲，佔地約一千八百平方公尺，接收時僅有骨架，現在己裝修元成，並有客車軍架兩輛，正在趕裝頭二等及三等客車，該廠除負責修製本路車輛機件外，擬即接受外界委託修製機件業務。在這複雜的塲合中，却是幷幷有餘，畦町不紊，每一個角落裏，每一個工作者，都現着規律整潔而又緊張的精神，無怪凌次長頻頻點首，贊許不置了。機廠的緊鄰，是九龍崗機務段，步進鐵門，長長的一條煤干甬道，辦公室條車塲，列建其旁，牠和機廠同樣的工作緊張，同樣的井然有序。</p>
<p>「柳條兒難擊行螅」，凌次長的專車，在一聲長笛及軍樂高奏和恭送的行列中，離開　龍崗了。凌次長到淮路雖僅半天，但所得的印像及給予淮路的啓示，是十分深切的。</p>
<p>編者案：關於資源委員會礦產測勘處淮南煤田探勘隊工作，本報曾有紀載，茲據讀者楊文俊先生來函，始悉該隊詳情，特轉錄其要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）探勘隊的原名資源委員會礦產測勘處淮南煤田探勘隊，礦產測勘廳分號出去的採勘隊，至少已有五個，我們是其中之一。</p>
<p>（二）探勘淮南是本處卅五年度計劃之一。報載「謝家榮氏之來淮南不過是觀光而巳，」顯係傳聞之　。</p>
<p>（三）探勘隊是由礦產測勘處副工程師燕樹檀所率領的，全隊的人員全由測勘處所由京派來此間。淮南礦局派來了一位庶務先生，一位礦警所的警官，六個礦警。探勘隊在民間的草房內每天十二小時工作着。</p>
<p>楊先生為採測隊隊員之一，實際參加工作之餘，熱心指出上述情形，盛情堪感，附誌於此，以表謝忱。</p>

<p>購罐頭食物者注意</p>
<p>編者先生：最近市上店舖及攤販，到處有出售廉價牛乳奶粉各種罐頭食物，除罐頭餐品開罐即易發現其腐霉味變不致誤食外。至生乳奶粉，憑敝人等經騐諷爲不可靠。緣有敝友患肺病誤食此項牛乳，經吐瀉膠脹者半月，原已降低之熱度，反而增高，再三研究，始知誤食此項過期之牛乳，復食奶粉亦然。敝人偶食數次，亦犯此病，但身體較强，不如病人之利害耳。據傳聞此項各種大批罐頭，最近來自琉球羣島，大半為一九四三年左右為限之食品，現已超過限期，恐有毒素，盼市民注意。或請衛生當局公告！（上海一市民）</p>
<p>私校敎員要求配實</p>
<p>報載實物配給辦法，私校敎員與文化人除外，此誠大惑不解，私校敎負難道不是同樣爲敎育而工作者嗎？今日物價步步上昇，私校敎員之待遇，早於開學時決定，一學期內無調整司能，尤我南市學校，均處陋巷，學費不能訂收過高，待遇竟有較他區低三四倍之多，迄今一月二十萬元之待遇，普遍皆是。茲聯合呼籲，請政府當局准照公立學校一律待遇。（南市私校教職員王半農等）編者按：私校敎師李偉西等來函同樣呼籲不再刊出。</p>
<p>應糾正卑陋思想</p>
<p>在今日社會上每個人民對於舞弊貪污等事已經不覺驚奇，認爲是達到某階段的必然現象。除非此種貪污行爲有直接或較近間接使自己受到損失外，簡直不感興趣。數年來相習成風，壓迫得人民神經已麻木了</p>
<p>譬喻某人就任了什麼稅務，於是他的友好親戚一致向他道賀得到『肥缺』。他們明明知道所謂『肥缺』者即額外收入豐富的職位。更知道此職位的眞正俸金並不能稱得上『肥』，那末他們究何所指呢？他們的腦中已有了貧污的思想。明知貧污　還要去道賀，這眞是非常可痛的事。不久前某外人來吾國考察政治，回國後言『中國官塲普遍貪污』，可是他還沒發覺中國人民的腦子也已被貪污的顏色染黑了。</p>
<p>除絕對少數外，一般人民的思想和行動已歪曲不堪，從忽視本位的職責，以至營私牟利，縱慾享受。隨便揀任何一件事作例，就說公共事業機關吧，辦事人負理應格外盡力作事，因為是替公衆服務，然而適得其反，敷衍塞責，也許是薪金多少的關係不肯苦幹實幹，然則爲了少數人的不安於職，而使大衆受不良影響，這可是應該的嗎，我們有了這樣的人民，却希望有一個良好的社會，豈不甚難。一般憤世嫉俗者常批評政府的劣點，却忽略了人民歪曲思想的潛力。</p>
<p>世界上一切戰爭本起因於『貪』。現在一國有了大多數『貪』和『不爲公衆着想』的人民怎會使戰爭的火焰熄滅，怎會使國家的組織健全。國人每天祈　着和平幸福，却付出了『貪污』『不負責』的支票，道種交易是不會成就的。（金嘉平）</p>
<p>羅浮路泥濘待修</p>
<p>編者先生：前日參議會開會，提出各區修路議案，　有天潼路山西路……交工務局分別輕重辦理。查虹口羅浮路，原是一條長方石塊砌成的橫馬路。在敵偽時期馬路另一旁的房子都倒塌了，從此便成爲一塊空曠的廢墟，堆滿了垃圾，最近又蓋了不少的平房。可是這些平房內都沒有去水的溝渠，所以一切不潔的水盡倒在馬路上，日積月累將馬路大溝渠塞住了，以致渠裏的水，泛上馬路，變成了泥窪，雖在晴天亦難於行走，我們希望工務局併案修建以利民行。（羅浮路全體住戶）</p>
<p>消費合作社要整頓</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>閱貴報讀者意見攔鼓勵普辦消費合作社，甚表同情，查本市十九區（楡林區），於勝利後即由本區當局發起組織消費合作社，成立已近年餘，僅配過無關日用必需的食物五六次，配售時亦不通吿各社員，故社員向隅者頗不乏人。現在沉默三個月之久，形同虛設。當此本區區長新舊交替時期，請新區長迅即接收該合作社，加以整頓，切實辦理配售日用必需品，使社員享受實惠。（某甲長）</p>
<p>眞北路橋樑要搶修</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>眞北路爲北新涇與眞茹交通要道，此公路有數座橋樑，通稱二號橋，三號轎，四號橋。均係木質。自敵偽時期迄令，頃，行人經過，莫不但戰心驚筆者某日經過三號橋，因橋面零落不堪，輕重失衡，不幸墮入河中，爲此因恐後人重蹈覆轍，故特懇借貴報一角，籲請有關當局，督促槍修，以利交通。（礱賓源）</p>
<p>學生甄審問題答復</p>
<p>前據沈雲鷗君函詢學生甄審問題，茲逐條解答如下：（一）凡未經甄審者不論其入學試騐成績如何一律不能改爲正式生。（二）本市將於最近期間舉辦第三决甄審，惟日期尚未決定。（三）部令規定高中三下學期不准招收插取生，如有學校違令辦理，敎育行政機關，自難給畢業證書。（四）傳聞之誤，絕對不確</p>
<p>靜園村衛生改善</p>
<p>讀者王君豪投靜園村要改善衛生一文，經刋出後，准上海市衛生局函稱；「當飭淸潔總隊第八中隊調查，據復該弄並無傾倒垃圾便桶情事。遍訪王君豪亦無其人，當出其證明書一紙證明該弄衛生情形，業已改善」。特此刊登。</p>

<h3>葛胡賽氏近影</h3>
<p>（其旁為雕塑佛像）</p>
<h3>書店夥計</h3>
<p>— 馬襄</p>
<p>想做書店夥計，不自今日始。老早老早我就拜託了我的老師向上海各大書店去設法過。</p>
<p>現今，我居然無意之間，做了這人文薈萃的著各都市裏的一家書店的夥計了。我坐在書店裏賬桌上，那一個顧客會不認我是一個書店夥計。而且是管賬的。</p>
<p>書店夥計做做，滋味真不錯，踏進書店，大槪總是個知識份子，（至少不是文盲）。像我喜歡搭搭訕，倒也認識了好幾個朋友。也讓我知道了各色人物對於各色書本的批評與好惡。</p>
<p>有時，老闆新進了一大批書，整理是次要的工作，首先是定價。眼看一本好書進價是五百元的，老闆知道「好」定價一定就是二千元。老闆好，我們夥計也好。定價貴了，銷路滯呆，我們可以從容楷油看二遍。</p>
<p>整理好，定價好之後，就是是自己先看書啊！貪餱的眼睛左右逢源地看那一本好呢？這時，我想起了到浴室中，常見堂官們赤裸裸地在吃飯。我想吃飯時為什麽不穿褲子呢？哦！現在我才領悟了：這才是一種驕傲。不是書店夥計，怎能不化一個錢，按照自巳的心愛一本一本地細讀這許多新書呢？電影院職工看電影，木匠師父修矮凳，都是這個道理吧！</p>
<p>却說有時因為新書來得太多了，拿一本看看太隨便了。以致到東到西都是書樓上一本「最佳獨幕獨劇」是我躺着看的。胡適博士的「白話文學史」是我臨睡前重着用來催眠的。艾迪博士的「靑年性坐活」，雖明知是佳書，因是論文，看來太悶，常常要割愛。二本早先讀過的「文心」與沈從文的「湘行散記」，却被為了要充實與顧客搭訕的題材而看的「三國演義」，「紅樓夢」奪了寵。「湘行散記」看畢又想看看「月下小景」，看到一半被另外一位店員捏着，我只好暫停片刻。有人說張天翼的「追」很好，我就想看。在書櫥中與「追」為隣的「子夜」又似乎在向我招手。我要看「激流」那麽三厚本。看過了高爾基的「母」，「人間」不能不看。劇本也需看一些，「正氣歌」看了好久，「風雪夜歸人」却是陌生的。臧克家的詩集也是我愛好的，我也決心要看。</p>
<p>我現在兼管銀錢出入，會計似乎也應該學一些。英文，俄文，店中旣然有這類書，我為何放棄翻都不翻呢？我一定要讓，要仔仔細細地研究。……喲！這末許多書，千頭萬緒，我從何入手呢？</p>
<p>最可惜的，就是自己決定要看一遍而還沒有輸流到的書，却被一個顧客買去了。而且店中只有這麽一部。一部「會計學原理」，就是在這種心理下把書包紮好了戀戀不捨遞給顧客的。</p>
<p>我漸漸地做像一個夥計，做像一個書店夥計了。所不够的，商人們例有的說謊及信口誇大的技巧，總見拙劣異常，進步殊慢。</p>
<p>書店夥計滋味眞不錯。一天我正翻着「大地」，看到王龍如何進城與荷花大談其過去未來時。忽地老闆在我的肩上拍了拍：</p>
<p>「喂：主顧來了」。</p>
<h3>歛鴿鈴</h3>
<p>— 玄衣</p>
<p>我神往着那一陣嘹喨悠漾的鈴聲了。</p>
<p>當三月底風拂着原野的草靑了，當三月底風拂着原野的花紅了，當三月的天飄浮起輕絮一樣的白雲時，你曾神往於藍色的晴空，晴空飛掠過鴿羣，鴿羣賸留下的一陣淸盈的鈴聲嗎？</p>
<p>愛自由的人，他是多末嚮往着這一陣清音呵！</p>
<p>鴿鈴是一串幽長的幽長的聲種餘音，它漾泛着你的心海的漪浪，於是你乃會憑窗緬念天涯飄游的友人，在家鄉河岸收牛的童伴。以及那一些綿遠的曾是溫馨的含五月風情的戀事了……</p>
<p>白鴿翱翱在無垠的天野，逍遙地生活着。</p>
<p>你，愛自由的人呵！其不會神往着那一陣瞭喨悠漾的鴿　嗎！</p>
<h3>初春隨筆</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>春來了。窗外一棵不知名的植物，開出了幾朵黃色的小花。</p>
<p>好幾次我想把那些小花摘下來。我想用一個綠色的瓶子把牠們供起。將牠們放在案旁的摑儿上。於是淸晨，靜夜，寂寞，無聊，或痛苦的時候，我的靈魂可以橋上了那些小花，像「靑鳥」裏的孩子們插上了薄薄的輕羽，能够隨時隨地飛出窗外，飛到渺遠的天邊，去尋找一些希奇美麗的失去的萬夢。……</p>
<p>但是我並沒有這樣做。我把窗子用力一關，笑了，笑自己的痴呆！</p>
<p>但是我又即刻收住笑容。我看看書桌上一張未完的文稿，笑了，哭自己的無用和無卿！</p>
<p>我默默地躺到床上，側着頭，靜望着那扇緊閉的窗格，那窗格上蒙着白漆的玻璃，玻璃上白漆剝落的一塊，有一個小小的孔眼。我如道：只要我的眼睛湊上孔眼，我仍能窺得見外面美麗的藍天，藍天下的白雲，自震底下悠遊飛翔的小烏。……</p>
<p>我也知道：淸晨旭日東升，滿天緋色的紅光散開來的時候，小鳥依然歌唱，柳枝仍舊搖曳。紅色的玫瑰依舊放出沁人的香氣。滿地鮮艷的野花和靑靑的小草，還是像以前一樣的蓬勃壯麗！</p>
<p>我更知道：繁唾爍閃之夜，經倩的白雲隨風遊移。那時候，新月一彎，斜掛中天，射下來一片瑩潔的光輝，如一條銀白的紗毯，覆蓋大地。那時候，小草休息，鮮花睡眠。小鳥兒躲在溫暖的窩巢裏，發出奇妙神秘的夢裏的歌聲：「喞喞喞喞……」</p>
<p>春天的園子啊！描慕不盡的將情畫意！我為什麽早早把「柔情」的窗子關起？甚至連一個小小的「憶念」的孔限，都讓牠冷然空廢？</p>
<p>躺在床上，問着自己。似乎不能回答。起來坐在桌前，握着筆，苦思苦思，是後在紙上落下這幾行字：——</p>
<p>早早把柔情的窗子關起，</p>
<p>為了空洞的幻夢徒然使我流淚。</p>
<p>寗願讓記憶的孔眼冷然空廢，</p>
<p>為約有更大的工作在我面前。</p>
<p>時代是鐵鑄的巨輸，</p>
<p>載着生命的列車向前猛進！</p>
<p>跨上事業的高山，</p>
<p>回過頭來，</p>
<p>柔情和憶念，——</p>
<p>二顆飛閃在煙塵中的流星，</p>
<p>稍瞬即逝！</p>

<h3>中國之友　歷史家葛胡賽</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>一九三〇年一月中旬，筆者剛在法國里昂大學考過論文，接得含耐。葛胡賽先生（Rene　Grousset）從巴黎來電，呌筆者上巴黎去玩玩。我和葛胡賽先生素昧平生，我只知道他是一位東方語言學者。到了巴黎，見過了面，我又知道他於一八八五年生於山明水秀的葛朗諾勃兒城（Grenoble），目前担任琪美博物院（Mrsee　Guimet）的副院長，他正在修改他的「遠東史（Histoire　d'Extreme-Orient）。在另一方面，象徽派的大本營「法國的水星」（Mercure　de　France）裏的一位小說家倪煦先生（Charles－Henry　Hirsch），也是素昧平生，也招我到巴黎去玩。由於葛胡賽先生的介紹，我認識了許多漢學家，如：伯希和（Paul　Pelliot），馬伯樂（Henri　Maspero），哥羅勃甫（Goulobev）等等；由於倪然先生的介紹，我進了「永星」，認識了許多文學家，如：紀德（Andre　Gide），諾雅綺伯爵夫人（Comtesse　de　Noailles）等等。十多年來，如蟻旋磨，我自愧毫無建樹，然而知己之感是不可忘的！</p>
<p>葛胡賽先生是一位東方（近東及遠東），史家。他的著作都是鉅部的著作。在「遠東史」以前，還有「亞洲史」（Histoired'Asie），那是他的發祥著作——在「遠東史」之後，更有：「亞洲的夢醒」（Reveild'Asie），對於中華民族的解放，中華民國的成立，極表同情；「追隨着佛」（Sur　les　traces　du　Bouddha），提起了三藏法師，以及其他中國聖僧；「遠東文化史」（Civilisations　d'Extreme-Orient），中國文化自悉佔極重要的位置；「十字軍史「（Histoire　des　Croisades特別注意東西文化的交流.一九四四年，法蘭西文學院(Academie　Francaise）須給葛胡賽先生「路易，巴爾都獎金」（PrixLouis　Barthou）路易，巴爾都是歷史家兼外交家，曾經組過閣，當過外交部長，又是法蘭西文學院的會員。</p>
<p>葛胡賽先生由琪美博物院副院長升任賽爾諾斯紀博物院（Musee　Cernuschi）的正院長。一九四五年歳暮，法蘭西文學院選舉他為會員：這是一個法國文人所能獲到的最高榮譽。</p>
<p>到過重慶的人，總還記得法國大使館文化處的前任文化專員埃里賽夫（Vadime　Elisseeff）——他取一個中國名字：葉理夫——以及他的未婚妻古彎麗小姐（Francine　Caullery）。這位年輕的漢學家（伯希和的得意門生）就是葛胡賽先生的義子。一九四六年二月，葛胡賽先生告老退休，便召葉理夫先生回巴黎去繼承他的職務．</p>
<p>這樣一位心嚮中國的人在中國，似乎沒有幾個人知道他：這是不公平的！誠然，他的研究中國文化並非要人知道他，然而以我們中國人的立塲，對他不能不懷感：這便是我寫這篇介紹文字的綠因．（南京；三十六年三月四日）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風　195</p>
<p>她這們一擺架子，那身後站着的兩位衛隊，也像蛆蟲似的，扭動了一下，與她的行動配合一致，有些吶喊助威的意思。</p>
<p>「哦……尊駕想必就是衛戌司令部的長官？」鶴見一臉的嘻笑皮臉。</p>
<p>「嗯……！」她這聲音又短又促，大概氣到分際了，似乎即有爆炸的可能。</p>
<p>「那麼請問長官貴姓大名？」鶴見問着，還來了一個鞠躬式。</p>
<p>「金司令，聽見過沒有？」——這是川島芳子的渾名呀。我很疑訝。</p>
<p>「哦，金司令，金璧輝？」鶴見好像要賞鑑她的曲綫美似的，從頭打量到脚，又從脚打量到頭，好像說「見面不如聞名」似的。</p>
<p>金璧輝不就是那出賣了一切的川島芳子嗎？我沒有福氣見過這位女潑皮，這時一聽鶴見說出她的台號，我覺得一震；我身旁的耀羣大約也是一震，却又聽見她似　　一嗤一了一聲，表示輕蔑；連小老虎，　　在一起，受了一驚；可是我料準了他從來沒有聽見過這個名字，更不知道川島芳子是個什麽東西，這時表示驚異，大概是受了我和耀羣的影響。</p>
<p>「……也請報報姓名罷！」她有十二分的忍耐不住了。</p>
<p>「不敢，參謀總部設計主任鶴見玉。」</p>
<p>「哦……原來是鶴見主任；她換了日本語，也換了口氣，也換了態度；大部分是驚愕，小部分是慶慰。慶慰之中，也滲和了些狐疑。這副混和的表情，都在那陰險狡毒的一雙眼珠上，一閃動之間，完全顯露出來。</p>
<p>為什麽驚愕？大概是久仰大名今天居然見了面；為什麽慶慰？這們我也說不出所以然來，也許是獵戶　見了芷在追踪的一隻大蟲？那麽，又為什麽狐疑？大概鶴見出塲，似乎不應該在這種塲合之下，而且派頭不够；也許是混充字號，冒名頂替的。</p>
<p>「不敢，不敢！」鶴見只說了這四個宇，驟然住口，雖也是用的日語，那日語的音調，比我們大個子「〇四」的日語——高麗夾山東音，還要難聽。</p>
<p>雖然情勢相當緊張，我一聽到鶴見這們一鬧，簡直忍不住要笑出聲來。我很明自鶴見故意捉狹，大概預備跟這位女司令開玩笑了。</p>
<p>「怎麽說，岳先生？」耀羣悄聲問着我。我剛要把猜想的意思吿訴耀羣，驀地瞥見她眼光一定，神色一肅，好像發見了一個極可恐怖的景象似的，同時嘴唇顫動，默　一般，嗎喁地念着，隧音幾乎細微得聽不見：</p>
<p>」同志們……準備行動…！！」</p>
<p>聽到耀羣這一念，呌我驚疑不止。這裏並沒有警報的設備；沒有紅光，更沒有嗤嗤的聲音；仔細再看了耀羣一眼只見她兩隻眼珠定住，好像被人催眠到了第二期恍惚狀態的情形。</p>
<p>我一瞧情形不對，怕有高手暗算耀羣，剛想使用强調「喚醒」方式，驚動耀羣，只見她一手把虎城邀了過來，顫動着朱唇，用幾乎聽不見的嗄音，耳語似的繼續念着：</p>
<p>「同志們……準備行動……各出動支隊已發令調回，池備從外攻入，室內同志，一聽信號，切勿動手……必須乘敵退却。再行側　……總部命令。」</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>前些日子，我看了一張影片——「居里夫人」。我感動得厲害，因為我喜歡牠在偉大中現出平凡，平凡中現顯出偉大。</p>
<p>然而，我對影片中「居里夫人」所下的結論，甚有反感。她說：「科學是人類唯一的價値。」</p>
<p>「科學是人類唯一的價値嗎？」</p>
<p>「你能想像原子彈如果掌攙在法西斯暴君手中的結果嗎？」</p>
<p>自然，假設夫人不是科學家，是詩人或文學家，我是不會向她發出如上的　問題的。</p>
<p>「士可殺不可辱。」</p>
<p>「英雄可被仇視，不能被蔑視。」</p>
<p>尊敬在一切底愛裏，始終佔領着首席的地位。牠鎮壓着人類的歷史。</p>
<p>「生命誠可貴，愛情價更高，若為自由故，二者俱可拋。」</p>
<p>自由是什麽？自由乃是　於尊敬底人權；牠插着思想與行為的兩扇翅膀，無論是在　　的苦海或希望的議端，牠都能任意地飛翔。</p>
<p>生命的幻減，並非自由的幻滅；愛情的死亡，亦非自由的死亡。</p>
<p>侗　非當的人都不惜毀滅生命取情愛，換取軀　上一秒鐘的自由。</p>
<p>——因為那正是靈魂上無限時空的自由。</p>
<p>偉大的人性，在予能各觀地批判自己，在予能承認自己的過失及弱點。因為勇於改過者不是恥辱，而是光榮。</p>
<p>可是，奇怪的是像歐洲某大哲人說的那樣，「世上的鏡子雖多，而人們往往不能自知其貌。」許多醜女都　　化大部份的時間，對着鏡子搔首弄姿、如果你目睹此情態，為之失笑。彼醜女必定會以為你是在讚許她底美麗，甚至故作嚴辭地詞責你：「死鬼！笑什麽？一定沒有存好心眼。」因為如果沒有最猛烈的　　以發酵，自醜的見解，是很難得釀成的。</p>

<h3>中央儲蓄會的幽默並提出一個建議</h3>
<p>— 吳大權</p>
<p>戰前頗為有名中央儲蓄會所辦理約有獎儲蓄，目今彩額的分配是：特彩一個，頭彩，二彩，三彩，四彩各四一六個，附彩一個，末彩八三三四九個。彩金的分配是：特彩四十萬多一點，頭彩二千元，二彩三百元，三彩二百元，四彩一百元，附彩二千元不到一點，末彩十二元。每一月開彩一次，依上表計算，每月應發彩金一千一百五十萬餘。</p>
<p>然而，這裏有個「然而」，照現在情形，肯眼巴巴的跑到中央儲蓄會去領買不到半隻大餅的十二元彩金的，想也沒有，這八三三四九個末彩的彩金，中央儲蓄會根本可以毫不支出，省下來計一千萬元光景。一千一百五十萬，减去一千萬，中央儲蓄會每月僅須付出彩金一百五十萬。</p>
<p>實際上，還沒有這末許多。它的二彩三彩四彩的彩金，祗有三百元，二百元，一百元，拿道些戔戔之數，付來回的車錢也不瑴，誰高興趕去拿？這三項彩金統計不到廿五萬，又可以省下一百五十萬。减去廿五萬，中央儲蒂會每月祇要付出一百廿五萬左右的彩金。</p>
<p>現在中央儲蓄會的儲戶，共有八三三四九九戶，每月每戶應存入十二元，即在今日，中央儲蓄會並未要求增加，儲戶每月亦僅須付給中央儲蓄會十二元，中央儲蓄會這一點待儲戶的好處確是不該抹煞，然而今日的世界上吃虧的事情那有人做，中央儲蓄會這麽辦，另外有個小小轉灣。</p>
<p>在敵偽時期，中央儲蓄會曾為偽政府接辦，此番復員，中央儲蓄會就要求儲戶更換會單；更換會單的時候，規定每戶應將本應分十五年的十二個月付的會費，改為一次獻足，換言之，儲戶即裏失分期付款的利益，靠了這末一個噱頭，中央儲蓄會雖未將每月十二元的會費增加，但因將會費一次收足的綠故，反受利益。再替它算一算：</p>
<p>中央儲蓄會的每一個儲戶，每月應繳十二元，一年應繳一四四元，十五年即為二一六〇元，中央儲蓄會共有八三三四九九儲戶，今因一次繳足，二一六〇乘八三三四九九，中央儲蓄會共收入十八億餘元。以最近上海通行利息一角計，每月得息即達一億餘元。以之和每月付彩一百廿五萬元相比，中央儲蓄會出息之厚，可以想像！假使它包括的是有錢人，這口氣還嚥得下，可憐身受其剝削痛苦的，却都是我們「升斗小民。」</p>
<p>像我的一張會單，到期在民國四十九年十一月，到期應得金額為二千餘元，照目前通貨澎漲的趨勢觀察，到民國四十九年這二千餘元鈔票，不知道還値不値錢？儲戶所有希望，都寄在中彩上面，而中央儲蓄會編有十二元，一百元，二百元，三百元的彩金四項，應發金額佔全額百分之九十以上，豈非存心開儲戶玩笑？無奈我們窮人實在沒有這樣「幽默的心境。」</p>
<p>我以為中央儲蓄會，旣可因時勢變遷，而將應該分期付款的改為一次繳足，為何不能將彩額彩金軍行調整，寗可减少獎額以豐厚獎金。譬如：二，三，四，末四彩都可取消，改為一萬元二萬元的彩額若千個。中央儲蓄會如以我的建議為中聽，在下謹候賜教，請不要再「幽默」了。</p>
<h3>新病名</h3>
<p>— 仕傑</p>
<p>家庭醫師：「勃菲爾先生，我祝賀你」！</p>
<p>病人：「（興奮的）是不是我將要復元嗎」？</p>
<p>家庭醫師：「不，我想不至於吧，因為你的病還是第一次見到呢！在你死後，我們正想把你的名字，題為這新病的病名呢！」</p>
<h3>擠</h3>
<p>— 紫流</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，人們都向上海湧流，上海的人口突然增加了好幾倍，不但條條條里街內的房屋都塞滿了人，尤其馬路上的行人車輛更熙熙攘攘的擁擠不堪，每一個在上海生活的人莫不歎息着：「上海的確太擠了！」看昨天的報紙，知道上海市政府公用局，特自美國聘請管理交通專家康偉博土，哈爾博土及里柯爾博士三人來滬，設法改善上海交通，使上海的馬路不太擠。這無疑地是一個好消息，一旦交通改善，固然不能連帶的解決房院問題，我們一般窮朋友擠電車和公共汽車終要容易一點，而走路穿十字馬路也不令懷着太緊張的心情了吧。但是我感到奇怪的：上海為什麽這麼擠？抗戰以前的上海不是沒有這麽擠？抗戰了八年犧牲了許許多多人，上海的人為什麽反而大擠特擠了呢？</p>
<p>昨晚在一個朋友家裏，聽見一個蘇北籍的娘姨對那個朋友的太太嘆苦說：「上海走路眞不容易，一不小心，就要被汽車軋死，假使我的家鄉太平，有好日子過，眞不要住在上海這個鬼地方。」這幾句平平淡淡的話突然使我領悟到上海為什麼太擠了。自然，為了家鄉不得好日子過，才到上海來討活，眞不知有多少人，他們有的家鄉鬧兵災，有的家鄉鬧天災，有的家鄉為惡勢力把特難以住下去，這樣，就不約而同的大家懷着一顆痛苦的希望的心到上海來了，熱望在這個繁華的都市中得到一個啖飯之所。於是乎上海的人口突然增加了，而上海的地區到底祇有這麼一塊，那麽怎麽會不擠呢？</p>
<p>因此，我以為如果天下不太平，許多人依然不能回家去安居樂業，那使美國交通專家來上侮，用盡九牛兩虎之力，恐怕也離以解決上海太擠的問題吧。</p>

<h3>「天堂春夢」</h3>
<p>— 文淑</p>
<p>我看了「天堂春夢」的試岟，覺得敢為觀衆介紹。</p>
<p>這故事描寫一個正直的工程師，在這不合理的社會裏，雖然辛勤底工作，竟不能保全一個棲身之所，而另一些「寄生虫」都坐享其成。其實工程師要是能依附貪污舞弊的法術，又何至於連太太的生產費也要出賣親骨肉來抵儻呢？他還不是一樣可以住高樓大廈，出入以汽車代步，這就是現實，這就是善良的靈魂打入地獄受難，奸惡之徒昇天堂享福的世界。</p>
<p>我讚賞編劇聽明的手法，一開頭用「勝利了還要停電」來喻示勝利之後仍是一片漆黑，在「春夢」裏用低康的物價，和合理的酬報給予工作者，一片安居樂業的景象，跟這烏七八精的現實，來一個強烈的對比。全片成績優異就歸功于導演，他簡練的剪接，氛個的佈置，處處別具匠心，譬如利用上官雲珠的手，從無鑽戒到有鑽戒兩個連接的鏡頭暗示一件重大的事件業已完成等等。</p>
<p>路明的丁太太演來自然明晰，恬淡溫靜，缺憾是當她發現自己的孩子以後還不够激動，和最後孩子被搶走之後，應有複雜的過程。</p>
<p>藍馬演得相當成功，老練而沉着，　　某些刻劃人物的造型上過了一點，聲音控制還需要研究，前後有過幾種不同音色的聲音出現，不知是錄音還是他的技術問題，石羽稍嫌軟弱，某些控訴的塲面因之而乏力，王蘋的服裝太　腫，時別在夏季和同塲演員單　的衣衫十比較，份外明顯，她的戲是絲絲入扣的。上官雲珠道角色，先天就易於討好，因之演來極其生動。其他許多演員都很好，平均而實在的達到了完滿的合作。</p>
<p>演員大部份來自舞台，總結的說他們都肯做戲，但有一些通病，因習慣了舞台的方法，某些應該有細膩的過程省略了，對於鏡頭前的動作沒有揉合在圓澗的節奏裏。但他們却沒有「老油子」式的死眉死眼的瘋吞水的表情。</p>
<p>攝影，佈景都是上乘之選，這是一部超過以前幾部片子的作品，因之我大胆的敢為觀衆推薦。</p>

<h3>以故事舉例</h3>
<p>— 長流</p>
<p>台灣事件，這兩天如野火一樣，正在燃燒。想賢明的當局，一定有適當的處置。</p>
<p>先在這裏說一個故事：卅四年一月新某縣告急的時候，向以政治淸明的某縣，一個最能幹的縣長，常日寇距離××最近的時候，民衆武力突然叛變，離開這個孑然一身的縣長</p>
<p>後來據一位當地的老法律家對記者說：這證明兩點：第一，表示平日政治與民衆脫節，因為民心的向背，總有爆發的一天；第二，×××政治設施是淸明的，但×××的，幹部如某縣縣長之流，以高壓手段强制執行政令，平日人民或許敢怒不敢言，但民怒不能久藏。</p>
<p>那位白髮蒼蒼的老法律家作了一個結論，他說：一個政治家，在現在民主激流狂潮朝中，應故到兩點：（一）探尋民隱，（二）政令應從下而上，使老百姓亳無隱痛。</p>
<p>台灣是一個敎育水準高於全國任何地方的省份，這次事態的擴大，決不是偶然的，希望常局能够順從民意，尋求民隱，用溫和的政策，即速解決這正待蔓延的「野火」。</p>

<p>「哈哈！人家說我老祝樂觀，想不到你老徐比我更樂觀！湖北的戰事這樣吃緊，敵人的進攻這樣猛烈，國軍的給養和待遇又是這樣菲薄；而你們還說獻金勞軍是大可不必的。那末，我倒要請問你：什麽才是必要的呢？」祝兆年的品氣也漸漸轉為號硬，但臉上笑容未歛。</p>
<p>「搶運物資！」徐紹明毫不思索地回答。「現在這個時候，最急要的自然是搶運物資！為了國家，為了抗戰，為了………」（十）</p>

<h3>Central Government Decides on a Lenient Policy to Handle the Unfortunate Taiwan Incident; Chairman Instructs Taiwanese Compatriots to Strictly Observe Discipline</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Concerned about the situation in Taiwan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi and others at 9:00 PM last night for a long conversation lasting one hour. He continued to meet with key personnel on the 10th. When attending the Central Memorial Week ceremony in the morning, he stated that the recent Taiwan riot was by no means a simple administrative and economic problem. The expansion of the situation was related to the Communist Party elements lurking in Taiwan, as well as former Taiwanese soldiers and sailors who had participated in the Japanese invasion in Nanyang. The government has now decided to send Minister Bai to offer condolences and handle the aftermath. Li Yizhong, chairman of the provincial party headquarters, and others will accompany him. Minister Bai summoned Li Yizhong in the morning of the 10th to inquire about the situation. He also met with representatives from six Taiwanese groups on the evening of the 10th and visited the Chairman again at 9:00 PM. Bai is expected to depart in one or two days. At the same time, the central government has decided to appoint Zhu Shaoliang to succeed Chen Yi as the chairman of Taiwan Province. This matter will be announced after Minister Bai returns from his condolence visit to Taiwan. Liu Yuqing, commander of the 21st Division, flew to Taiwan yesterday afternoon on the "Meiling" special plane with several senior staff officers from the Ministry of National Defense. In addition, another division may be sent to reinforce the defense and stationed in key areas of Taiwan to restore local order as soon as possible. It is reported that the "February 28th Incident" Handling Committee had a resolution to notify government armed forces to disarm voluntarily. Therefore, it can be seen that their intention is not limited to demanding political reforms, but is close to betraying the central government. Observers in Nanjing believe that the current situation in Taiwan should be dealt with as soon as possible to avoid further escalation. According to Li Yizhong, chairman of the provincial party headquarters, who spoke to our reporter on the 10th, the central government will handle the Taiwan incident based on the following three principles: (1) Adopt a lenient policy, dealing with everything from a broad perspective; (2) Within the scope of the Constitution, adopt the legitimate demands of the people; (3) The political system of Taiwan Province should be the same as that of other provinces in the mainland. As for the early implementation of popular elections for county magistrates, which the Taiwanese people requested to begin in June of this year, the central government is currently studying this matter.</p>
<h3>Government Officials to Go to Taiwan Immediately; Troops to Maintain Security Arrive in Keelung</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The central government held a memorial week for Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 10th, led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun reported on the general situation of the ministry's work in 1946, the Chairman gave instructions on the cause of the unfortunate incident in Taiwan and the central government's policy in dealing with it. He briefly stated: The causes of the unfortunate incident in Taiwan have been published in various newspapers and need not be described in detail. Since the recovery of Taiwan last year, the central government believed that the local order in Taiwan was good, so it did not send regular troops to station there. Local security was maintained by the military police. Over the past year, the compatriots in Taiwan's agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic circles have demonstrated a spirit of law-abiding and support for the central government, showing their patriotic spirit no less than that of compatriots in any other province. However, recently, some Taiwanese who were conscripted by Japan and sent to fight in the Nanyang area, some of whom are Communist Party members, took advantage of the crackdown on smugglers and peddlers to instigate riots and demand political reforms. As constitutional government is about to be implemented and the administration of Taiwan should return to normal as soon as possible, the central government can grant local governments the powers stipulated by the Constitution and implement them ahead of schedule. Chief Executive Chen Yi, following the instructions of the central government, has publicly announced that the governor's office will be reorganized into a provincial government, the Chief Executive's Office will be abolished, and popular elections for county magistrates will be implemented within a certain period. All Taiwanese compatriots expressed their joy and willingness to accept this. Therefore, this unfortunate incident could have come to an end. Unexpectedly, last Friday (the 7th), the so-called "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" in the province suddenly made unreasonable demands, including abolishing the Taiwan Garrison Command, surrendering weapons to be kept by the committee, and requiring that all land and naval forces in Taiwan be staffed by Taiwanese. This kind of demand has exceeded the scope of local politics, and the central government cannot recognize it. Moreover, illegal activities such as attacking government agencies have occurred one after another in recent days. Therefore, the central government has decided to send troops to Taiwan to maintain local security. It is reported that the troops sent have safely landed in Keelung last night, and the order is good. It is believed that normalcy can be restored soon. At the same time, high-ranking officials will be sent to Taiwan to assist Chief Executive Chen Yi in handling this incident. I have also strictly telegraphed the military and political personnel remaining in Taiwan to await the central government's personnel to handle the situation and not to take retaliatory actions in order to achieve love, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation among all Taiwanese compatriots. I hope that Taiwanese compatriots will understand the greater good, strictly observe discipline, not be exploited by treacherous parties, not be laughed at by the Japanese, and not act blindly, harming the country and themselves. It is hoped that they will clearly understand what is right and wrong, distinguish between what is beneficial and harmful, thoroughly awaken, take responsibility by abolishing illegal organizations, and restore local order, so that all compatriots in Taiwan Province can live and work in peace and contentment as soon as possible in order to complete the construction of a new Taiwan. Only in this way can they live up to the painful sacrifices and arduous struggles of compatriots throughout the country for fifty years to recover Taiwan.</p>
<h3>"February 28th" Incident Handling Committee Disbanded by Chief Executive Chen; Broadcasts to the Whole of Taiwan a Decision to Severely Punish Traitors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] The actions of the Taiwan Provincial "February 28th" Incident Handling Committee have recently exceeded the scope of demanding political reforms and are close to rebelling against the motherland. Chief Executive Chen Yi issued an order on the 10th to disband it. Chen broadcast to the Taiwanese compatriots of the entire province at 10:00 AM, saying: "I have almost completely promised to resolve the problems of smuggling-related injuries and improve political issues that you all hope to solve, but a small number of traitors harbor treasonous conspiracies, and I am determined to severely punish them." Chen also said: "As for the relocation of the national army to Taiwan, it is to protect the people of the entire province and eliminate traitors, and there is absolutely no other intention. When people from other provinces were beaten in recent days, most of the kind Taiwanese people rescued them. This kind of righteousness comes from the pure love of compatriots. I express my heartfelt gratitude. I still hope that the kind Taiwanese people will give play to their sense of justice, love each other, and work together to build a new Taiwan." Since yesterday, the situation in Taiwan Province has become stable, and all agencies will resume work from tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Garrison Headquarters Issues a Public Announcement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] The Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters issued a public announcement on the 10th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>When the "February 28th" incident occurred, the government, in addition to handing over the personnel involved in the Monopoly Bureau incident to the court for severe punishment in accordance with the law and providing compensation for the deceased, also accommodated public opinion and accepted the proposed motions on political issues arising from the "February 28th" incident. It was meant that the incident could be brought to an end from then on, but a few war-mongering conspirators attempted to use the opportunity to seize power and betray the country. Starting from a corner of Taipei, they occupied radio stations, distorted facts, and exaggerated everything, inciting the public to riot. The sound of the incident spread throughout the province, causing chaos. As a result, administrative officials throughout the province were either held hostage or insulted, and government agencies were either occupied or destroyed. Public officials from other provinces and those who came to Taiwan for business were either robbed and killed or injured and maimed. The cruelty was so extreme that even women and children were not spared. The magnitude of the deaths and injuries is difficult to count. The evolution of the incident is unprecedented in history. The Japanese have intensified their efforts, becoming more and more intense, with their words and actions disregarding national discipline and public opinion, creating a state of anarchy. Furthermore, they advocated disarming the national army and abolishing the garrison headquarters, with their arrogance reaching the sky, almost making it impossible for Taiwan to survive without separating from China. Their betrayal of the country is obvious.</p>
<p>This Headquarters is ordered to command the garrison of Taiwan. All my compatriots in Taiwan should, from now on, live and work in peace, trust the government, follow the government's path to political resolution, and move together towards the path of building a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People. If anyone destroys the law, violates discipline, or acts beyond the bounds, this Headquarters, in order to stabilize the local area, will only exercise its powers and deal with it in accordance with the law without the slightest hesitation. As for those who participated in this riot, whether they were coerced or acted blindly, they may not be forgiven under the law, but there may be reasons for sympathy. If they do not alienate themselves from the people and do not fall into the clutches of the law again, they will be treated leniently.</p>

After the recovery of Taiwan, tens of thousands of public officials from Fujian crossed the sea with their families to serve in Taiwan. According to returning guests from Taipei, the largest number of casualties in this incident were public officials from Fujian. Relatives in Fujian were saddened by the news, and people were competing to inquire about the news on the streets. The telegraph office was extremely crowded, and the general reaction was somber.</p>

<h3>Subsidize Domestic Industry to Reduce Foreign Exchange Consumption</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It is heard that in order to prevent a large outflow of foreign exchange, the authorities recently passed a measure to assist industries that can manufacture products using domestic raw materials as much as possible through loans and other methods, so that their output can be increased to reduce the import of foreign goods. These raw materials will include cotton, tobacco, wheat, etc. In this way, the government can increase national treasury revenue on the one hand and prevent foreign exchange from being consumed on the other. In addition, my country's tariffs were generally low before the war due to Japanese pressure. Most of them are still at the pre-war standards, and it would not be entirely unreasonable to raise them in the future.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility for the "Zhongya" Shipwreck</h3>
<p>It Is Rumored That It Is Related to the Discipline of the Sailors</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 10th] There is much speculation about the number of casualties in the "Zhongya" shipwreck. According to the Tongxing Company, the hull of the ship is still floating on the surface of the water. There are more than 80 missing crew members. Based on the number of people who have been rescued, the number of passengers who died is at most 20 to 40. The rumor that 150 people died is not accurate. Among the rescued passengers, only Major General Huang Weiqiang of the Army has been identified. The names of the remaining passengers are not yet known. As for the issue of responsibility for the accident, it is generally attributed to the discipline of the sailors. A fire had occurred in the coal-burning room of the ship, and the Zhongya Company had requested the Sailors' Union to replace the crew, but the union did not agree, resulting in condoning and covering up, which led to the serious mistake.</p>

<h3>Zhang Changde, Deputy Commander of the 144th Division, Executed by Firing Squad for Gathering Crowds for Rebellion and Insurrection and Colluding with the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Changde, deputy commander of the 144th Division of the 50th Army of the Army, was stationed in Qingyang, Tongling, Nanling, and other counties in Anhui Province with his troops in the spring of 1944. The central government removed Tang Ming from his position as commander of the 144th Division and reassigned Bai Liang to fill the position. Zhang then colluded with his subordinates and telegraphed the central government to withdraw the order and refused to hand over the command. A team was sent to disarm them, but Zhang resisted with his troops, occupying the areas of Qingyang, Tongling, Nanling, and Fanchang in Anhui, arbitrarily changing the designation, calling himself the commander-in-chief of the Independent Army Corps, and concurrently serving as the pseudo-administrative chief of the Southern Anhui Special Zone. On September 1, 1944, he ordered the subordinate pseudo-administrative office to purchase grain and rice for the enemy's army corps. After the enemy surrendered, the First Disciplinary Inspection Group of the former Military Commission verified the facts, submitted them to the Chairman, and telegraphed the Chongqing Executive Headquarters to detain the criminal. The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense organized a collegial trial. Based on Zhang Changde's acts of betraying the party and the country, gathering crowds for riots, and colluding with the enemy, he was sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. Upon approval of the Chairman, the sentence was carried out. On the afternoon of the 10th, the criminal was identified, tied to the Yuhua Platform execution ground, and executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Compatriots All Willing to Serve the Motherland; Unfortunate Incident Should Be Resolved Quickly</h3>
<p>— Representatives of Six Taiwanese Groups Host Journalists in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Representatives from six Taiwanese groups, including the Taiwan Provincial Construction Association, hosted a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 10th to report on the truth of the "228" Incident and the requests of Taiwanese compatriots to the government. The representatives unanimously expressed their support for the policies announced today by Chairman Chiang at the National Government regarding the handling of the Taiwan incident. However, they hoped that the reasonable demands of the Taiwanese compatriots could be adopted by those in power, and denied that the incident was instigated by undesirable elements as a planned act of resistance against the central government.</p>
<p>After the reception began, Yang Jiachun first delivered a speech, explaining how eagerly Taiwanese compatriots looked forward to the motherland at the beginning of Taiwan's recovery. At that time, all six million compatriots in the area wished to contribute their strength to the work of the motherland's revival. However, in the past year and six months, Chief Executive Chen's various measures were difficult for Taiwanese compatriots to accept. Chen could hardly shirk responsibility for the consequences of today. Yang firmly denied that the incident was instigated by "undesirable elements" and did not believe that its purpose was to "resist the central government." Yang stated in an impassioned tone, "After Japan surrendered, Taiwan was a clean land. I can guarantee with my life that Taiwanese compatriots all obey the central government." Finally, he earnestly hoped that the voices of the six million compatriots could reach the central government and that the incident could be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Then, Chen Bisheng reported on the course of the incident and the issue of responsibility. He also severely criticized Chief Executive Chen's measures in Taiwan and deeply regretted that the points raised in the petition to the central government last year against special treatment had not been adopted. Chen explained that they deeply supported Chairman Chiang's policy on handling the Taiwan incident, which was announced at the National Government's memorial week today. However, he solemnly stated two points: 1. This incident was entirely an automatic resistance erupted by the people due to their inability to bear Chief Executive Chen's policies. It had absolutely no background and was not a planned action. 2. Taiwanese compatriots have always loved the motherland and always considered themselves a part of the Republic of China, and recognized Taiwan as a part of the motherland's territory. There was absolutely no resistance to the central government or exclusion of compatriots from other provinces. Chen did not deny that a small number of undesirable elements with ulterior motives may have mixed in. However, he said that this was only an extremely small number.</p>
<p>Dispatch Senior Officials to Handle the Aftermath Quickly</p>
<p>Chen hoped that the government would prioritize leniency and the overall situation, and seriously handle the incident. Sending troops to Taiwan would easily lead to misunderstandings. He hoped that senior officials could be dispatched to Taiwan quickly to announce comfort, handle the aftermath, and restore order. He also said that since the Chief Executive's Office will have to be abolished sooner or later, it should be abolished as soon as possible. Finally, Wang Liming and others also delivered speeches one after another, detailing the hopes of the Taiwanese compatriots. After the reception, Pang Bangjie and others went to visit Minister Bai Chongxi to discuss the Taiwan incident.</p>
<p>Illegal Demands of the Handling Committee</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] In addition to passing 32 articles of political reform proposals, the Taiwan Provincial "228" Incident Handling Committee also passed a motion to "temporarily disarm the government's armed forces in various locations." After this news was published by local newspapers, it was generally believed that the committee's motives were no longer entirely for demanding political improvement, but were attempting to betray the country. Although the committee issued a statement on the 8th, saying that because of the large number of people attending the meeting at the time, it was not possible to consider everything carefully. For example, the abolition of the Garrison Headquarters and the disarmament of the National Army were close to rebelling against the central government and were definitely not the public opinion of the provincial people. However, at 10:30 PM on the same day, rioters attacked the Eastern Gate Garrison Headquarters, the Yuanshan Naval Office, and the Huashancho Police Station, attempting to force the government's armed forces to disarm. The government believes that the military is the country's military, so it re-imposed martial law starting at 6:00 AM on the 9th and temporarily placed transportation and telecommunications agencies under military control. The Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters also issued a notice this morning stating: "Starting from the 10th, all illegal groups will be abolished and gatherings and demonstrations will be prohibited." The headquarters also stipulated that all civilian-owned firearms must be registered with the headquarters immediately, and severe punishment will be imposed if found.</p>
<p>American Officials Fly to Taiwan for Inquiry</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Military Attaché Colonel Dodd of the American Embassy paid visits to Chief Executive Chen Yi and Staff Officer Huang Ke Yuanfen of the Garrison Headquarters at 10:00 AM today. Dodd arrived in Taiwan yesterday morning at 10:00 AM on a military plane from Shanghai. It is reported that when he spoke with Chief Executive Chen, he expressed his personal impression of the current situation regarding the recent disturbance, saying, "The current situation here is extremely stable, the order is good, and the lives and property of American expatriates are also safe and guaranteed." Dodd returned to Shanghai on the original plane this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] It was rumored in this city that the Taiwan Chief Executive's Office was also surrounded by rioters. This statement has not been confirmed. The telecommunications contact between the Taiwan Administrative Office and its Shanghai Liaison Office has been cut off since 5:00 PM on the 9th, and has not yet been restored at the time of publication. However, according to Manager Xie of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Taiwan, the rumor that the head office of the Bank of Taiwan was destroyed by rioters on the night of the 9th is absolutely unreliable. The Shanghai Branch of the Head Office received a message from the Bank of Taiwan yesterday afternoon reporting that everything was safe and sound. Most Taiwanese people expressed extreme dissatisfaction. Chief Executive Chen Yi was originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing before the Third Plenary Session to report on his work, but now, at the request of local gentry, he has decided to postpone the trip indefinitely and continue to be stationed to maintain order.</p>
<p>It was also rumored that the Taipei branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was occupied by Taiwanese. Deputy General Manager Hu Shiyuan of the company said that the Taipei branch of the company sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday afternoon reporting that everything was safe and sound, which seems to be a false rumor.</p>
<p>According to responsible parties at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the company's Shanghai-Taiwan money transport ships are still sailing as usual, and all telecommunications have not been interrupted.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The "Zhongxing" and "Tainan" ships that sailed to Taiwan after the "228" Incident have both arrived safely. However, because local order has not been fully restored, all people from other provinces have not gone ashore in order to ensure the safety of their lives and goods, and will return on the original ships. It is reported that the Zhongxing will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 12th).</p>

<h3>Progress in Negotiations on Government Reorganization; People's Socialist and Youth Parties Will Not Participate in Technical Departments; Jiang Yuntian Flies to Hong Kong; Lei Zhen Changes Return to Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Negotiations on the reorganization of the government have now entered the stage of personnel coordination. According to a government official, although the negotiations on the participation of various parties in various departments have not reached the final decision, it is generally known that the People's Socialist and Youth Parties will not participate in technical departments due to a lack of talent. As for the departments they will participate in, it was originally planned to adopt an exchange system for the ministers and vice ministers of each department. However, due to many personnel disputes in political circles, it is currently possible to decide that the minister and vice minister belong to one party. It is also untrue that the Youth Party will take over the Ministry of Judicial Administration.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Jiang Yuntian of the People's Socialist Party flew to Hong Kong on the 10th to invite Li Daming and Wu Xianzi, who are in Hong Kong. Jiang guaranteed to government officials that he could fly to Shanghai with Li and Wu on the original plane on the 11th. The party will then convene a Central Standing Committee meeting to make a final decision on participating in the government, and then come to Nanjing. It is heard that if Jiang's words are realized, the date of the reorganization of the government will not be far away. Zhang Junmai has also agreed to participate in the government.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The People's Socialist Party's full participation in the government still needs to be decided after the two Standing Committee members left in Hong Kong arrive in Shanghai. According to an official, Wu Xianzi sent a telegram to Shanghai around the 7th, saying that it was difficult to leave Hong Kong in the short term, and hoping to consider full participation after the Third Plenary Session. The government hopes that Jiang Yuntian will go to Hong Kong immediately to welcome Wu Xianzi and Li Daming to Shanghai as soon as possible, so as not to delay the reorganization of the government for too long. Therefore, Jiang Yuntian left Shanghai for Hong Kong yesterday. It is heard that Wu Xianzi is quite insistent on the simultaneous opening of local political power, which is quite close to the Youth Party's proposal. Hu Haimen and Liang Qiushui, the northern representatives of the People's Socialist Party, will arrive in Shanghai on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The People's Socialist Party's internal opinions on the issue of participating in the government have not been unified, but there is no phenomenon of external division. The party's Vice Chairman Wu Xianzi stayed in Hong Kong and did not return because his private affairs were not finished. He and Li Daming believe that the reorganization of local governments is as important as the reorganization of the central government, which is not significantly different from the views of other people. Liang Qiushui and Hu Haimen from the north have not expressed their intention to leave the party. Unless there is an accident, the two will arrive in Shanghai in a few days.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Secretary-General Lei Zhen was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing last night, but he decided to postpone it for one day because his mission in Shanghai was not completed.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Shao Lizi and his wife took the night train back to Nanjing yesterday. Before leaving, he presided over the groundbreaking ceremony of the Denghui Hall of Fudan University. He mostly avoided answering the questions raised by reporters. Shao said that he only spoke to Lei Zhen once on the phone yesterday and had no other activities. When asked if the government was no longer trying to resolve the CCP issue through political means, he replied: When the situation permits, the government is still willing to resolve it through political methods. When asked about his feelings about the disturbances in Taiwan, he said that he could only answer in eight words: "Too many things to say, no way to start." Regarding Zhou Enlai's recent speech, Shao said: "Too busy, didn't read the newspaper."</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Will Go to the United States to Teach This Autumn; Denies That He Will Be Sent to the United States</h3>
<p>[This City Dispatch] Former Director of the Executive Yuan, Jiang Tingfu, met with a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday and denied the rumors that he would be sent to the United States. He also said that he would go to the United States to teach this autumn for a year and then return to China. Since leaving his position as Director of the Executive Yuan, Jiang has been writing books behind closed doors. He recently completed an English version of his autobiography, which will be published in the United States. The book describes his childhood life in the countryside of Hunan, his experiences studying in the United States, and his administrative and diplomatic experiences after graduation. There are more than a dozen parts, and a Chinese version will be published in the future.</p>
<h3>Five Air Routes to Be Opened Between China and the United Kingdom According to the Civil Aviation Agreement; Connecting London, Singapore, Borneo, and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 10th] It is heard that the Sino-British Civil Aviation Agreement will include five air routes, two from China to the United Kingdom. One will reach London via India, Myanmar, North Africa, and other places, and the other will reach London via Japan, the United States, and other places. The above two lines are reciprocal in nature. The other two are Southeast Asian lines, one ending in Singapore and the other ending in Jesselton, Borneo. The last one is the Shanghai-Hong Kong line. It is heard that our side initially believed that there was no need to open a new line between Shanghai and Hong Kong. After several consultations, it was decided to open the route, but the capacity and schedule will be restricted. In addition to the above five lines that have been agreed upon, the two sides are continuing to negotiate the opening of two other lines. As for the Chinese airports that will be used in the future, there will be four locations: Kunming, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin. It is reported that the biggest difference between the Sino-British Aviation Agreement and the Sino-American Aviation Agreement is that (1) if there are disputes between China and the United Kingdom, they will not be submitted to international conferences but will be resolved through mutual consultation; (2) the Sino-British Aviation Agreement has no time limit. If one of the contracting parties deems it necessary, it can notify the other party to cancel it.</p>
<h3>Air France Plans to Open a Hong Kong-Vietnam Air Route</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] Air France announced today that it plans to open a new air route between Hong Kong and Indochina. It is currently negotiating with the Chinese government to allow the company to fly and land in Guangzhou and Hainan Island.</p>
<h3>Ministry of the Interior Compiles Population Statistics</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Population statistics are closely related to the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators. However, the years of statistics from the Ministry of the Interior are not consistent, and the investigating agencies are also different. Relevant parties worry that inaccurate figures will be adopted. It is better to compile a "reasonable" statistical table based on various available figures. This work is being compiled by the Ministry of the Interior and other agencies and will be completed in a few days.</p>
<h3>Revising Foreign-Related Laws; Legislative Yuan Sends Wu Shangying and Others Abroad to Investigate Foreign Legislation for Reference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] After the abolition of unequal treaties, various foreign-related laws in our country need to be revised. However, when carrying out this work, it is felt that it is necessary to refer to foreign legislation. At the same time, the actual situation in our country should also be made clear to each country in order to avoid conflicts during future implementation. For this reason, the Legislative Yuan decided to send Secretary-General Wu Shangying, Legislator Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sheng Zhenwei to inspect various groups in the United Kingdom and the United States. Wu and the other two will depart after the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The 317th meeting of the Fourth Legislative Yuan will be held at 9:00 AM on the 11th in the Legislative Yuan to discuss general routine cases. As for various cases related to the constitution and regulations, a series of four meetings will be held at the end of the month to submit them to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhiping Replies to Philippine Note, Clarifying Our Attitude Towards the Philippines; Never Intended to Control Any Neighboring Country</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 10th] Chinese Minister to the Philippines Chen Zhiping sent a note to Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino today regarding the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty, stating: "The situation hindering our negotiations has not seen significant improvement." The note Chen submitted today was a reply to Quirino's note, stating: China does not intend to request any special conveniences, such as those that the United States may enjoy in the Philippines. This is not a problem in the treaty. China has never intended to control any neighboring country politically or economically. There is no reason for your statement that the Philippine government "cannot abandon national interests to comply with the wishes of other countries." China has been striving to abolish unequal treaties for decades. It is unimaginable to say that China now intends to force unfavorable treaties on friendly countries.</p>
<h3>Menon Visits Foreign Minister Wang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Menon, the first Indian Ambassador to China, visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie this afternoon, making his first visit since arriving in Nanjing. In addition, Hua Linzhe, a counselor at the British Embassy in China, has been promoted to Director of the British Foreign Office and will return to his country in a few days.</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Issues Order Strictly Prohibiting Soldiers from Marrying Foreign Women</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of National Defense telegraphed an order strictly prohibiting soldiers from marrying foreign women as wives in order to comply with regulations. For those who have already married foreign women, in order to take into account the facts, they are allowed to apply for Chinese nationality in accordance with the Nationality Law recently promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and their actions should be closely monitored.</p>
<h3>Unwarranted Worry; American Scholar Worries That Our Population Increase Will Inevitably Lead to Territorial Expansion After Decades</h3>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 10th] Professor Witt of Stanford University said at a meeting here last night that population restriction is closely related to economic stability, so American assistance to China and India should depend on the two countries' control of fertility. Currently, the population of the Americas and Europe has not increased much in quantity, but the population of China, the Soviet Union, and India is increasing sharply. If China's population continues to increase at a rate of 15%, then in 1980, China's population will increase from the current 400 million to 700 million. Improving agriculture and industry is not enough to cope with this population increase, which will inevitably lead to ambition to expand territory.</p>

<h3>Tani Hisao, the Main Culprit of the Nanjing Massacre, Sentenced to Death; The Judgment Was Served in Court After It Was Read Out</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing and Tianjin Dispatch, 10th] Tani Hisao, the main culprit of the Nanjing Massacre, was sentenced to death at the Nanjing Temporary Public Court in Lizhi Society this afternoon. Chief Judge Shi and others appeared in court on time. Soon, the convict Tani was brought to court. Tani was still wearing his old clothes. From beginning to end, his expression was calm and he showed no signs of panic. First, Chief Judge Shi asked his name and origin, and then read the judgment, which was immediately translated into Japanese. Tani did not change his expression after hearing the words "death penalty." The judgment took as long as forty minutes to read. The convict Tani requested that a Japanese judgment be issued at the end, but his request was not granted. The judgment was served today, and it was announced that Tani could appeal to our commander within ten days in accordance with the law. After approval, it would be returned for a retrial, otherwise it would be executed in accordance with the law. The main text is recorded as follows: "During the occupation of Nanjing, Tani Hisao jointly allowed his troops to kill prisoners and non-combatants, and raped, plundered, and destroyed property. He is sentenced to death."</p>
<p>Key Points of the Judgment</p>
<p>Facts: Tani Hisao is a brave and good general among Japanese warlords. When the Sino-Japanese War began in 1937, he served as the commander of the Sixth Division. At the end of the year, he led his troops to China to participate in the war of aggression. He first fought in the Yongding River in Hebei and Baoding and Shijiazhuang. At the end of November of the same year, the battles along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) line were frequently lost, and he moved to defend Nanjing. The Japanese military believed that our capital was the center of resistance, so they gathered their elite troops, including the fierce Sixth Division led by Tani Hisao, the 16th Division led by Nakajima, the 18th Division led by Ushijima, and the 114th Division led by Suematsu, under the command of General Matsui Iwane, and jointly attacked. In addition to the anger caused by the strong resistance of our army, they carried out a planned massacre after the city fell to show revenge. The Sixth Division led by Tani Hisao took the lead and captured Zhonghua Gate on the evening of December 12, 1937 (the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month). The vanguard troops climbed the walls with rope ladders and began to massacre. The next morning, he led a large army into the city and divided into various areas of Nanjing City with the troops of Nakajima, Ushijima, and Suematsu to launch a large-scale massacre, followed by burning and looting.</p>
<p>Killing</p>
<p>The most tragic period of the massacre was from December 12 to December 21, 1937, that is, during the period when Tani Hisao's troops were stationed in Nanjing. In Huashen Temple, Shita Bridge, Shiguanyin, Xiaguan, and Caoxie Gorge outside Zhonghua Gate, our captured soldiers and civilians were collectively shot by Japanese troops with machine guns and their bodies were cremated to destroy the evidence. There were more than 190,000 people. In addition, the bodies of more than 150,000 people were collected by charitable organizations for scattered massacres. The total number of victims reached more than 300,000. The area was covered with corpses, which was extremely tragic. The cruel situation cannot be described in words. For example, at 1:00 PM on December 15, more than 2,000 of our soldiers and police were captured by the Japanese army and escorted to Hanzhongmenwai, where they were densely swept with machine guns and died. Those who were wounded and did not die were all burned alive. At 6:00 PM on the 16th, more than 5,000 refugees from the Overseas Chinese Reception Center were escorted by Japanese soldiers to the Zhongshan Wharf in the port. Those who could still struggle were stabbed to death with random knives, and all the corpses were poured with coal oil and burned. For example, on December 12, a rural woman named Wang Xu was beheaded and burned by Japanese troops at Xiama Wharf outside Zhonghua Gate. On the 13th, a villager named Wei Xiaoshan was砍死 (kan si: beheaded to death) by Tani Hisao's troops because he went to put out the fire in the grass alley of Zhonghua Gate. On the same day, monks Longjing and nuns Zhenxingdeng and Gaodengyuan were also slaughtered in the temple outside Zhonghua Gate. On the 14th, a citizen named Yao Jialong took his family to Zhonghua Gate Zhanlong Bridge to take refuge, and his wife was raped and killed by Japanese troops. His eight-year-old son and three-year-old daughter cried beside him and were picked up with bayonets and thrown into the fire, burned alive. From the 13th to the 17th of the same month, when it was very cold, the Japanese troops stationed outside Zhonghua Gate ordered more than 30 villagers to go into the water to catch fish. Those who followed were frozen, and those who disobeyed were遭到戰 (zao dao zhan: met/suffered with war). An old man was tied and hung on a tree branch and used as target practice with guns. He fell to his death when the rope broke. Two Japanese officers competed to kill people. One killed 105 people, and the other won by killing 106 people. On the 19th of the same month, a rural woman named Xie Shanzhen, who was over sixty years old, was划殺 (hua sha: slashed to death) by Japanese troops with knives in Dongyue Temple outside Zhonghua Gate, and bamboo poles were inserted into her private parts, all of which were inhumane. It is estimated that from December 12 to December 17, 886 cases of innocent soldiers and civilians in our capital were brutally killed by Japanese troops and have been recorded. In addition to the above-mentioned cases, there were 378 cases of Wang Fuhe, Ke Dacai, Chu Weng, etc. who were killed in the Zhonghua Gate area. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Military Law Criminals Sentenced to Death Can Get Reduced Sentence</h3>
<p>Limited to Those Who Committed Crimes Before the End of Last Year</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of National Defense recently telegraphed to inform the provinces, counties, cities, and military organs at all levels that if a military law criminal whose death sentence has been approved by the Ministry of National Defense committed a crime before December 31, 1946, and the case meets the requirements for a reduced sentence, the execution should be stopped immediately and the sentence should be reduced in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Measures for Surrendered Imposter Lawyers Who Were Wanted to Resume Business</h3>
<p>Promulgated by the Ministry of Judicial Administration</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has stipulated that although there are regulations restricting the resumption of business for general imposter lawyers, some imposter lawyers have been wanted. How to deal with them is a matter of doubt for local courts. Recently, special measures have been stipulated to inform and notify. If an imposter lawyer is wanted for performing duties in a false court without other crimes, he can, after the expiration of the suspension period, obtain a letter of guarantee from two or more officers of the recommended rank and go to the local court in person to surrender. After investigation and confirmation, he will be allowed to transfer the request to revoke the wanted status and allow him to register and resume business. In addition, the deadline for imposter lawyers to apply for re-employment and reissue new certificates was originally the end of 1946, but it has now been extended to the end of March 1947.</p>
<h3>County Governments Concurrently Handling Military Law to End Before the End of April</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently ordered the High Courts in various places to inform that the system of administrative offices in pacification areas concurrently handling military law has been decided to be abolished. County governments should end the concurrent handling of military law business before the end of April and stop accepting new cases from now on.</p>
<h3>Huayuankou Starts to Close; Diversion River Simultaneously Releases Water; Water Flow Has Passed Liuyuankou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] The closing project of the Huayuankou gate and the release of water from the diversion river began on the evening of the 8th. This is the result of discussions at a meeting held by the Bureau of Restoration. At the moment, the breach has been reduced to 15 meters. The water level upstream of the breach has been raised by about 2 meters. The water flow entering the new diversion river has reached one-fourth of the total river. The side dam on the south side of the main dam is being backfilled. Several more spur dams have been built next to the side dam to reduce the pressure of the backwater from the sinking part. The arc-shaped surrounding dam on the north side of the gate is also being retreated from the east and west ends.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 10th] After the diversion river in the old course of the Yellow River released water, Yongtou flowed through Liuyuankou on the evening of the 9th. The old course of Liuyuankou is now about 2 li wide and 4 meters deep, and the water is quite turbulent. Song Tong, Director of the Henan Construction Department, inspected the water flow at Huayuankou from 2:00 PM on the 10th. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission also sent personnel to inspect.</p>
<h3>Strange Plane Discovered Over Construction Site</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] A strange plane flying from the northwest direction was suddenly discovered over the Huayuankou dam construction site at around 11:00 AM on the 10th. After circling twice, it flew to the southeast. When it flew to the west weir for the second time, it flew very low. The workers on the construction site were disturbed and dispersed. Work was suspended for two hours before it returned to normal.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of the Shanghai Municipal Government Organization Regulations</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government Organization Regulations were passed by the Executive Yuan and disclosed in various newspapers, they have attracted considerable attention due to the significant streamlining of the organization, which will reduce the number of personnel under the Municipal Government from over 3,300 to over 1,900, having a major impact. In fact, the number of personnel is only one aspect of the issue; another aspect, the adjustment of the functions and powers of various bureaus, is even more noteworthy. A comparison of the functions and responsibilities of each bureau under the current system and the new system is presented below, item by item, recording the additions, subtractions, and changes for discussion.</p>
<p>First, the following are items not included in the current system but added to the new system:</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Bureau (formerly the Civil Affairs Office) adds: (1) Matters concerning the demarcation of municipal areas; (2) Matters concerning etiquette, customs, and religion (originally under the Social Affairs Bureau); (3) Matters concerning the prohibition of opium and drugs (previously without explicit regulations).</p>
<p>Finance Bureau adds: (1) Matters concerning the operation and management of public enterprises; (2) Matters concerning assistance with national tax collection.</p>
<p>Education Bureau adds: Music, drama, film, broadcasting, and other aesthetic education (mostly originally under the Social Affairs Bureau).</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau adds: Matters concerning the New Life Movement. This matter was originally under the bureau's jurisdiction, but without explicit regulations.</p>
<p>Land Administration Bureau adds: Matters concerning the disposal of public land, also originally under the bureau's jurisdiction, but without explicit regulations.</p>
<p>Health Bureau adds: (1) Matters concerning health education and training of health personnel; (2) Matters concerning vital statistics; (3) Matters concerning the inspection and analysis of bacteria, diseases, and pharmaceutical chemistry; (4) Matters concerning the supervision of municipal hospitals, infectious disease hospitals, and health clinics and other institutions.</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau adds: (1) Matters concerning the management of ships and aircraft; (2) Matters concerning agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, fisheries, and animal husbandry (originally under the Social Affairs Bureau).</p>
<p>Police Bureau adds: (1) Matters concerning investigation and suppression; (2) Matters concerning assistance with military service and household registration.</p>
<p>Second, the following are items listed separately in the current system but not included in the new system:</p>
<p>Finance Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the supervision and direction of municipal banks; (2) Matters concerning the investigation and adjustment of the city's economy.</p>
<p>Education Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning vocational education; (2) Matters concerning national physical education and health education.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration; (2) Matters concerning factory inspections; (3) Matters concerning the protection and regulation of afforestation, land reclamation, animal husbandry, and hunting; (4) Matters concerning the management of books, newspapers, films, and theater; (5) Matters concerning the supervision and direction of religion and the improvement of customs.</p>
<p>Land Administration Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the supervision of real estate brokers; (2) Matters concerning the improvement of public land, the cultivation of wasteland, and the management and promotion of agricultural and forestry experimental fields.</p>
<p>Health Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the inspection and management of food and drink, and the supply of pharmaceuticals, instruments, serums, and vaccines for the entire city; (2) Matters concerning the disposal of garbage and excrement.</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the investigation and design of urban planning; (2) Matters concerning the registration, examination, and regulation of technicians and manufacturers, and the issuance of licenses; (3) Matters concerning the establishment of engineering standards and the inspection of materials.</p>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the supervision and guidance of water, land, and air transportation, but adds an item on vehicle traffic inspection, which may be included; (2) Matters concerning the planning and management of wharves and warehouses; (3) Matters concerning the registration, licensing, examination, and regulation of water, land, and air transportation drivers and water, electricity, and gas technicians and manufacturers; (3) Matters concerning the construction and management of streetlights, standard clocks, and municipal radio stations; (4) Matters concerning the establishment and implementation of equipment standards, service standards, and fee prices for public utilities.</p>
<p>Police Bureau removes: (1) Matters concerning the establishment and alteration of police districts; (2) Matters concerning the investigation of special households and foreign affairs police; (3) Matters concerning the investigation of criminal cases.</p>
<p>Formally speaking, the Health Bureau has undergone the most changes. Not only do its functions and responsibilities differ greatly from the current system, but they are also completely different from the recently approved Nanjing Municipal Organization. It does not resemble other bureaus, which largely copied the established rules of the Nanjing Municipal Organization Regulations. Substantively, the streamlining of the Social Affairs Bureau is the most obvious. For example, agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, fisheries, and animal husbandry are assigned to the Public Works Bureau; religion and etiquette are assigned to the Civil Affairs Office; and film and theater are assigned to the Education Bureau. It is unclear where agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration, factory inspection matters, and book and newspaper management matters will be assigned. Furthermore, the New Life Movement, aimed at changing customs, is clearly a matter of etiquette, but it is not incorporated into the Civil Affairs Office. Instead, a special item is added to the Social Affairs Bureau, which is also difficult to understand. Some say that democracy is now being implemented, and in the future, large-scale books and newspapers will not be managed, which naturally makes sense. However, is it also proportional to let factory inspection and all agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration go unmanaged? It is impossible not to doubt. When the Shanghai Municipal Government was first established, there was a Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, which was later merged with the Bureau of Public Welfare and renamed the Social Affairs Bureau. This was the beginning of the Social Affairs Bureau in China. Is this city the only major industrial and commercial port in the country? We do not believe that this administration can be completely abandoned in the future. Others say that various ministries have established offices in Shanghai, and perhaps they will be taken over and managed by the central government, without the need for local management, which is also a way of saying it. Moreover, at a time when the city's finances are extremely difficult and there is a great need to reduce personnel and administration, there may also be considerable reasons. However, according to this example, what else can be taken over and managed by the central government other than agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration? And which city other than Shanghai is applicable to this example?</p>
<p>Garbage and excrement disposal is a very heavy task for the Health Bureau, and it is also a large source of income and expenditure. Whether it is government-run or commercially run, the principle has only recently been approved by the Senate. The new system also completely removes it, and we do not know what the intention is. We do not believe that this matter can also be interpreted as being taken back and managed by the Central Health Administration. As for agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, fisheries, and hunting, is it a bit too far-fetched to include them all under the Public Works Bureau? It is really not easy to understand. Health education has been included in the Health Bureau, which is understandable. However, it is worth studying whether vocational education can be completely omitted. The most incomprehensible thing is that the central government has repeatedly issued orders to promote national compulsory labor, but it is not mentioned in the new system. We do not know which department should handle it. After the winding up of the handling committee, many parties concerned bumped into each other and could not find a competent authority. The new system also does not mention it, which also seems to be a shortcoming.</p>
<p>According to strict legal procedures, this organizational regulation must also be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. It is hoped that these issues can be appropriately remedied during the legislative process.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 10th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received US Secretary of State Marshall this afternoon for an initial courtesy call.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] The venue for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be the Aviation Club outside Moscow. The Soviet Union had kept it extremely secret in advance, so that the Western delegations were still unable to confirm the location of today's meeting on Sunday night. The full name of the Aviation Club is the "Soviet Aviation Industry Building." In the Tsarist era, this was a gorgeous Gypsy dance area.</p>
<p>This is Marshall's first time participating in the Four-Power Conference and his visit to Moscow, so he maintains a quiet and solemn, even cold, attitude. He only received Bevin last night. This is Marshall's first major test since taking office as Secretary of State. The focus of the disputes in the coming weeks will be on him more than anyone else. He promised to implement the policies pursued by his predecessor Byrnes, but these policies will be Marshall's tactics not only towards the Soviet Union, but also towards Britain and France, which occupy important positions. At the same time, Marshall was the first to sing a cautious and optimistic tune. Although he warned of great difficulties ahead, he predicted that these difficulties would be resolved through peaceful negotiations. However, many of the representatives of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom expressed pessimism.</p>
<h3>Main Objectives of the Conference Four Documents Will Be the Basis for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 10th] The main objectives of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference are as follows:</p>
<p>"Soviet Union"——Requests the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement, four-power joint management of Germany, but at the same time there must be a unified Germany.</p>
<p>"United States"——Hopes to conclude an agreement in accordance with the path prescribed by former Secretary of State Byrnes to ensure that Germany is permanently disarmed.</p>
<p>"United Kingdom"——Hopes that the Moscow Conference will help extend the validity of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty to fifty years.</p>
<p>"France"——Joint management of the Ruhr industrial area. If the four countries cannot resolve all of the above issues, they may be able to reach a substantial agreement.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] Observers here recently commented on the future work of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, saying: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be extremely difficult at the beginning, and it is difficult to expect it to achieve rapid results. The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will have four documents as the starting point and basis for its discussion, namely (1) the draft peace treaty with Austria. The four countries' resolutions previously achieved at the London Conference were far greater than other issues, so if the four foreign ministers can quickly reach an agreement on several pending issues (such as guaranteeing Austria's independence and the method of handling German assets in the border area), then the peace treaty is very likely to be drafted during the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and may even be signed in Moscow.</p>
<p>(2) The report submitted by the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on the procedures for drafting the peace treaty with Germany. There are many different opinions on this issue, which are difficult to resolve, especially regarding the manner in which countries without representatives attending the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will participate in the drafting of the peace treaty with Germany. Opinions are quite divided. (3) The report submitted by the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on the opinions of the allied countries other than the four powers on the German question. (4) The report submitted by the Allied Control Council for Germany, which reviews the work of the four powers in the occupied areas of Germany from Germany's surrender to February 1947. This report was originally jointly drafted by the four powers to show that each occupied area implemented the unified principle of the Potsdam Agreement, but the four occupied areas each implemented the principle of the agreement differently for various reasons, especially because of fundamental misunderstandings about the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement. The main points of this difference are (1) measures to disarm Germany and eliminate the Nazis; (2) Germany's foreign trade plan; (3) Germany's temporary administrative organization. The authorities in the four occupied areas all acted in accordance with their own concepts and interests in the above aspects.</p>
<h3>Czech-Austrian Negotiations Begin Yesterday Held Separately in the Capitals of the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 9th] Well-informed sources here said that the Czech Republic and Austria will simultaneously hold negotiations in Prague and Vienna from the 10th. The negotiations between the two sides in Prague aim to conclude a commercial treaty, while the negotiations in Vienna are to discuss the Czech Republic's territorial claims against Austria. The Czech side requested to obtain a small part of Austrian territory along the Danube River, opposite Bratislava, so that in the future, after a canal is opened between the Oder and Danube Rivers, port facilities can be built there. The Czech Republic is willing to provide Austria with economic benefits to compensate for its territorial losses.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Criticizes British and American Policies Towards Germany and Austria</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 9th] On the eve of the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet diplomatic authority weekly "New Times" published a large number of articles severely criticizing British and American policies towards Germany and Austria, and accusing the three main representatives of the US delegation, namely Clark, the US military commander in Austria; Dulles, the Republican leader; and Trebor, an expert on German economic issues. It is claimed that the US and the Soviet Union intend to establish a federal political system in Germany, which is actually a "vague way" and a means for Western capitalist monopolies to control the resources of western Germany. At the same time, a "Great Wall of China" is erected between the eastern and western occupied areas of Germany. The current issue is whether Germany will be transformed into a peaceful country or become a vassal of imperialism. The article in the weekly criticized Dulles' proposals regarding Germany and called Churchill "the old fox of British imperialism." The UK and the US are merging the occupied areas in the UK and the US economically, and their ambition is to save Germany's reactionary labor force at all costs and protect its economic forces from being liquidated. Dulles, Marshall's economic advisor, is one of the initiators of this plan. In short, narrow and monopolistic groups are directing how to reorganize Germany. These profit-seeking groups are very harmful and must be resolutely driven out by all democratic and progressive forces. Another paper criticized British and American policies towards German assets in Austria, and mentioned Clark's attitude, believing that the British and American actions violated the agreement, especially British and American support for Austria to nationalize certain enterprises. The Soviet Union believes that these enterprises are German assets and must be confiscated to compensate for losses. The articles in the "New Times" magazine mainly review foreign policy. Embassies of various countries here are paying close attention to them, because traces of the Soviet Union's future policies may be found in them.</p>
<h3>United States to Make Major Decision on Policy Towards Greece</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] When President Truman explains his plan to intervene in the Greek situation to the Republican congressional delegation today, everyone will probably ask him to explain everything and will also urge him not to forget the situation in China. It is expected that Truman will tell the fourteen congressional leaders that the United States must take over the important task left by Britain in order to trap the Greek communists in difficulties, for this most important diplomatic decision in American history, but Truman will also assure the congressmen that US troops will not be used. This explosive issue will cause debate in a few days, and its nature may be enough to change the entire foreign policy of the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] President Truman invited congressional leaders to the White House tomorrow to discuss the assistance measures the United States intends to take after the United Kingdom reduces its troops stationed in Greece. He is preparing with the White House staff today. According to the comments made by congressmen in advance, it has been clearly stated that the president should be asked to provide detailed explanations on the following two matters: (1) The relationship between the United States' assistance to Greece and the Soviet Union; (2) The possible expansion of the active assistance provided by the United States to Turkey and other places in the Mediterranean.</p>
<h3>Bevin and Molotov Congratulate Each Other on Their Birthdays</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 9th] Foreign Minister Bevin, 66, and Foreign Minister Molotov, 57, congratulated each other on their birthdays today, because today is the birthday of both of them. It is generally believed that the double happiness is a good omen for the Moscow Conference.</p>
<h3>United States Plans to Loan Money to South Korea to Build Transportation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] Well-informed official sources announced today that while the United States is preparing emergency assistance to Greece, it has also prepared a loan plan for Korea to build railways and other transportation facilities in the US-occupied area of southern Korea, and to repair textile and other factories. This plan can be submitted to Congress for discussion as soon as the Greek issue is resolved. It is unknown how much the loan will be. At present, the occupation fee is about 100 million US dollars per year.</p>
<h3>British Government's Economic Plan Sparks Fierce Debate in House of Commons Conservatives Prepare to Impeach Government</h3>
<p>[Report from our agency] London, 10th, broadcast: Attlee's Labor government is currently facing an unprecedented crisis, and a major cabinet reshuffle is possible. The House of Commons is discussing the government's recent economic plan, scheduled for three days. The Conservatives, led by Churchill, expressed distrust, and it is expected that the number of anti-government votes jointly cast by the Conservatives and Liberals may reach more than 200.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] According to the latest news from London, the crisis of the Labor government can be said to be safe, because even if the opposition votes can reach 200, the Labor Party still occupies 394 of the 640 seats in the House of Commons. Prime Minister Attlee has asked all members not to give up voting under any circumstances.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Minister of Commerce Cripps will present the economic plan to the House of Commons today and call for the cooperation of the people of the country. The government will move to ask the parliament to approve this plan, while Conservative leader Churchill and others are preparing to propose an amendment, expressing regret for the government's failure to disclose the facts earlier, and believing that the government's future plan is inappropriate and even harmful, and cannot express trust in the government that has repeatedly aggravated the country's difficulties. If the amendment is passed, it will be equivalent to impeaching the government. Liberal MP Davis and seven others will also propose an amendment, condemning the government's failure to foresee the current difficulties and take appropriate measures in a timely manner. The debate is expected to last for three days. Prime Minister Attlee, Minister of Finance Dalton, Minister of Defense Alexander, and Minister of Labor Isaac of the government will all speak, and Churchill is scheduled to propose the Conservative amendment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] The House of Commons will discuss economic issues from tomorrow. In order to cope with the situation, Prime Minister Attlee convened a secret meeting of more than 100 "rebellious" Labor MPs today to implement a scorched-earth policy.</p>
<h3>United States Orders Occupation Forces in Various Places to Collect Military Payment Certificates and Exchange for New Banknotes Expected to Collect 60 Million US Dollars in Tokyo</h3>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 10th] US occupation forces in Germany arrested nine suspects, including three US Army officers and civilian employees of the Army Department, half an hour after issuing an order to crack down on all counterfeit military banknotes in Western Europe. According to military officials, this order will be implemented simultaneously around the world. The order was issued by McNair, commander of the US forces in Europe, ordering all his subordinates to exchange military banknotes for another type of new banknote within a nine-hour limit on Sunday. According to McNair, this action was jointly carried out by the US Army, State Department, and Treasury Department.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] MacArthur Headquarters ordered the recall of US military payment certificates at 10:50 this morning and blocked all external communications in Japan in advance to prevent the leakage of information. The Finance Department of MacArthur Headquarters expects to collect 60 million US dollars in military payment certificates by 6:00 PM tonight. Thereafter, the current military payment certificates will be considered illegal, and new military payment certificates will be issued to replace them. According to Colonel Ross, Director of the Finance Department, although there are no cases of counterfeiting US military payment certificates in Japan, Japanese and other nationals are suspected of hoarding large quantities of military payment certificates. Although the military has announced that these military payment certificates are only for the use of occupation personnel, it is said that Japanese people are still engaged in purchasing them.</p>
<h3>Hiroshima in Reconstruction: 100,000 Residents Died from Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] Hiroshima, the first city to be bombed by an atomic bomb, is gradually being reconstructed. Humble houses, resembling "matchboxes," are being built one by one, vegetation is reviving, and an increasing number of residents are returning. After sixteen months of cultivation, Hiroshima, which was previously expected to remain desolate for many years, is now "full of life." American authorities told a delegation of Chinese journalists visiting Hiroshima that the city's current population is approximately 200,000 and is expected to reach 300,000 by the end of the war. The number of deaths caused by the atomic bomb is estimated at around 100,000. Despite the ongoing reconstruction efforts, the residents of Hiroshima and the general Japanese population will not forget the power of the atomic bomb for many years to come.</p>
<p>Explosion Zone to Forever Remain a Memorial</p>
<p>The authorities are currently drafting a plan to designate the most severely damaged area, where it is said the atomic bomb exploded in the air, as a memorial to warn the Japanese people. The empty shell of the former Commercial Museum's garden building still stands in the center of the area, within 2,000 meters of the completely devastated site. The journalist delegation saw an ancient tree, a thousand years old, uprooted by the force of the atomic bomb and burned for three days. They also witnessed an iron bridge near the museum, its two sides tilted due to the pressure of the explosion, with lanterns still hanging on the railings.</p>
<p>Trees Rose Skyward a Week After the Bombing</p>
<p>Even more astonishing is that in Hiroshima in 1945, trees suddenly rose from the ground, which was generally believed to be barren, at an extraordinary speed towards the sky for several days, before gradually slowing down and returning to normal. When the Chinese journalist delegation visited Dr. Takeuchi, the Japanese director of the Red Cross Hospital, he said that he only saw a flash of light like flames when the atomic bomb exploded, and heard nothing. He immediately lost consciousness, and when he regained consciousness (he was indoors), he found himself lying in the courtyard, with six small bones broken.</p>
<p>Mortality Rate of Residents Affected</p>
<p>His hospital treated 50,000 residents injured by the atomic bomb. After conducting thorough research, the following conclusions were reached: (1) All those within 0.88 kilometers of the blast center who were outside were killed. (2) Of those within 1.1 kilometers, 90.6% died. (3) Of those within 2.3 kilometers, 1.6% died. (4) Of those living in wooden houses within 0.5 kilometers, 99.9% died. (5) Of those within 1 kilometer, 75.3% died. The mortality rate for those living in reinforced concrete buildings was much lower than for those living in wooden houses. (6) Of those living in reinforced concrete buildings within 0.2 kilometers of the blast center, 97% died. (7) Of those within 0.5 kilometers, 30% died. (8) Of those within 1 kilometer, only 6% died. The experience described by a Catholic priest was similar to that of Takeuchi, but he stated that the atomic bomb was not the reason for Japan's collapse. The Japanese people only regarded such terrifying weapons as part of the war.</p>
<p>Remnants of the Hiroshima City Hall: It is said that the atomic bomb was originally aimed at this location, but it was spared from complete destruction because the bomb landed slightly north of it. (Special dispatch from the New York Times)</p>

All Indian people should unite against the so-called "British tactics."</p>
<h3>Russell on the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] Renowned mathematical philosopher Bertrand Russell said that the United States' monopoly on the atomic bomb cannot last for more than five years. According to him, if the new science is to prevent the world from being destroyed, the atomic bomb must be handed over to a world government. Therefore, we must fully support this novel political and military organization, otherwise, we can expect to encounter a worldwide catastrophe of terror and destruction beyond our imagination. He also said that within five years, all industrialized countries with sufficient resources of uranium and thorium will be able to manufacture atomic bombs. In his opinion, there are two ways for a world government to emerge: the better way is for countries to reach an agreement, while the quickest way is for one country to dominate the world. If such a dominant country were to emerge, it would clearly be either the United States or the Soviet Union.</p>

They had no fixed ideas about the future form of government and intended to use political parties to achieve their goals first.</p>

<h3>Jin Shenfu Road near Lupu Bridge: Major Fire in Industrial Area During the Day; Dozens of Factories and Homes Destroyed, Losses Huge and Incalculable</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] At around 2:00 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in a cotton yarn warehouse on the third floor of the Lide Cloth Factory, located at No. 77, B block, Lane 410, Jin Shenfu Road near Lupu Bridge. The fire quickly spread to a large amount of cotton yarn, and in an instant, it affected the adjacent Lixing Dyeing Factory at No. 78, B block, the Mingfeng Mercerizing Factory at No. 77, A block, the warehouse of the No. 77 Family Industry Cooperative, the office and materials room of the No. 78, A block, the No. 79 China Industrial Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the No. 80 Huimin Medical Cotton Gauze Factory, and the new factory of the No. 82 China Industrial Factory. Fire departments from the Central and Taishan districts dispatched multiple pump trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire. The Lujiawan Police Station, led by Chief Zhao, along with the first and second section chiefs Wang Liyan and Hao Jingxu, inspector Qin Bolang, sergeants Hao Chen and Ma Shaosong, and plainclothes police officer Li Zihua, together with volunteer police squad leader Wang Hansheng and Fan Yonglian, led their teams to the fire scene to maintain order and assist the affected factories and residents in salvaging goods. By around 3:00 PM, the fire had reached its peak and had spread to six civilian houses: No. 69, A block, Wang Ziqing, Nos. 70-71, Li Yaochang, No. 72, Chen Jinshan, No. 73, Huisheng Dormitory, and No. 74, Changxing Dormitory. The Datongnan Cigarette Factory at No. 17, Lane 474, Xujiahui Road suffered significant water damage due to the large amount of cigarettes stored in the factory. The fire was finally brought under control at around 5:00 PM, but there were still embers, so two water-spraying trucks remained until around 10:00 PM. According to an investigation by our reporter, the Lixing, Lide, and China factories were almost completely destroyed. Police officers at the scene told our reporter that there were two reasons for the fire: (1) The lane was too long, and the distance from the fire hydrant on the main road was too far, which delayed the water supply for firefighting. (2) The factories had a large amount of diesel fuel stored, and although police officers tried their best to move a lot of it out, some of the diesel fuel was ignited, making the fire uncontrollable. Firefighters at the time found that the water volume in the hydrant was insufficient for suction, so they connected to the water in the nearby Rihui Port River for replenishment. It was also said that the head of the bao (neighborhood), Yao Zhaowu, sacrificed his own property by rushing to help others move items, which is worthy of praise. As for the losses in this fire, in addition to the destruction of dozens of houses, the other goods were temporarily impossible to estimate. In short, the figure will be extremely large.</p>
<p>Also, during the fire, a sock factory apprentice named Ni Yutang fell from the roof while trying to escape and was injured, coughing up blood. He was immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment by fire rescue personnel.</p>
<p>(The first photo shows the situation during the fire. Taken by our newspaper. The second photo shows the apprentice who fell and is being rescued. Taken by China News Agency.)</p>

<h3>Who Will Be the Future "King of Manure"? The Lowest Bid Price is 450 Million</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The removal of feces has already been approved by the Council and is contracted out to businesses. The Health Bureau is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the contracting methods and details. It is reported that the lowest bidding price of the Health Bureau is 450 million per month, with 9,000 cartloads of manure per day as the principle. The contractor's wages, transportation fees, and other expenses also require 450 million yuan per month, so the contractor's total monthly expenses are 900 million yuan. If the contractor can obtain more than 9,000 incidents, the income will be calculated on a 70/30 split, with the contractor getting 70% and the Health Bureau getting 30%. If less than 9,000 cartloads of manure are obtained per day, the contractor will lose money.</p>

<h3>Yu Hualong Remanded for Retrial; Yuan Ludeng and Others Called as Witnesses</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Yu Hualong, who was accused of serving as the deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Puppet Baojia Autonomous Region, was previously sentenced to one year and six months by the High Court. The defendant appealed against the sentence, and the High Court remanded the case for retrial. The hair of Yu Hualong was already white, he was tall, wore dark glasses, and wore a black Ma-style wool overcoat. He stated that due to the bombing on Xizang Road on February 14, the northern section of the road was blockaded by the Japanese. The enemy wanted us to come out and handle the baojia in order to lift the blockade. Gao Yigen, a special agent of the Puppet Police Bureau's Special High Branch, forced us to organize the Urban Liaison Association, which was later renamed the Baojia Autonomous Committee, appointing Yuan Ludeng as the director, Zhou Bangjun and he as deputy directors, and Xie Baosheng and others as members. A meeting was held once at the Carlton Theatre on February 25, and another meeting was held at the Jinmen Hotel on March 1. No actual work was done. Witnesses Yuan Ludeng, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, Zhou Bangjun, who had been sentenced to three years, and Xie Baosheng, who had been sentenced to two years and six months, were then called to testify. The court hearing lasted a long time. It was decided to reschedule the trial, and the defendant and the three witnesses were all remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Ma Yigen Trial Concluded; Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Ma Yigen had studied tailoring in Japan in his early years. He was accused of serving as a clerk in the Puppet Pudong Police Branch during the fall of Shanghai.

<h3>Machine-Made Coal Briquette Association Petitions for Equal Contracting for Coal Briquette Distribution</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau previously selected the Yitaixing No. 1 Factory, the Nanyang No. 1 Factory, the China Factory, and the Xinfu Factory, based on the production volume and equipment of various factories in the city, to contract for the distribution of coal briquettes to public education personnel. Yesterday, representatives of the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to request the revocation of this order and to change it to having all members of the Coal Briquette Industry Association contract for the distribution equally. Director Wu stated that this could not be done. He also said that the reason why these four coal briquette factories were selected for contracting was because the Fuel Management Committee had to guarantee that their composition met the standards, that is, they were made of 50% white coal dust, 40% coal slag, and 10% yellow mud. The Fuel Management Committee also sent people to supervise the manufacturing. If there are many contractors, more people must be sent to supervise, which is practically impossible.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Shipyard and Workers Reach Termination Settlement</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has convened both parties for negotiations regarding the China Merchants Bureau's Third Shipyard's dismissal of 124 temporary workers. An agreement has been reached and a written record signed yesterday afternoon, stipulating: (1) In accordance with the methods for dismissing workers with indefinite contracts by the Municipal Labour-Management Arbitration Committee, dismissal pay will be issued in accordance with the law, and a certificate of leaving the factory will be issued separately. (2) The above-mentioned temporary workers should deduct three months' worth of temporary wages from the date of their employment in the factory, and the factory should reissue all of their weekly wages and holiday wages for the remaining service days according to the wages at the time of dismissal. The above method is only a one-time dismissal and cannot be used as an example for other people. (3) The wages of the above workers have been agreed by the factory to be settled up to March 20. (4) If the factory adds workers in the future, the above workers have the right to be re-employed preferentially based on merit.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute Between Weitai and Xiechang Factories Awaits Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Weitai Button Factory at 203 Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, Nanshi, has over 200 workers. Their salaries were originally paid every half-month, but now they are three periods overdue. Starting at 8 PM the night before last, workers surrounded the factory director and manager demanding full payment. The factory then stopped providing meals, and the situation remained deadlocked until 6 AM yesterday morning, causing work to come to a standstill. Yesterday afternoon, the workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding: (1) full payment of the one and a half months of salary owed by the employer; (2) continued payment of wages in the future; (3) payment of the February cost-of-living allowance; and (4) no dismissal of workers without cause. The employer claims that the business is unable to sustain itself, and this action is out of necessity. The Social Affairs Bureau has urged the factory to resume providing meals, and the workers are working as usual, awaiting mediation.</p>
<p>The Xiechang Cigarette Factory on Bailinan Road has over 300 workers. They recently filed a complaint with the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the factory had not paid the year-end bonus from last year, and wages were not paid on time. The factory also uses many child laborers in place of adults, and the workers' attempts to organize a labor union were suppressed. The bureau is currently sending staff to mediate.</p>
<h3>One-Third Cost-of-Living Allowance for Child Laborers Considered Reasonable, Wu Kaixian Expresses Opinion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee previously decided that after freezing the cost-of-living index, one-third of the February cost-of-living allowance would be paid to child laborers (including apprentices, trainees, and those in training). During a recent meeting of the Municipal Council, representatives from the cotton spinning industry petitioned that child laborers should be treated equally. The Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, expressed his opinion yesterday, stating: Child laborers are generally only assistants and are not the primary financial supporters of their families. Therefore, while it is inappropriate not to pay the allowance at all, paying one-third is more reasonable (as the cost-of-living allowance for daily necessities is calculated for a family of three). Although some child laborers are responsible for supporting their families due to the death of a parent, this is a minority.</p>
<p>Furthermore, workers in the cigarette and ribbon industries have filed complaints with the Social Affairs Bureau because some employers are not paying the cost-of-living allowance in accordance with the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee's decision. The bureau will strictly order the employers to comply.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Traffic is Worse Than Ever Seen, No Money Makes It Difficult to Start, Expert Offers a Bitter Smile, Building Tunnels Considered Absolutely Impossible</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, a reporter visited Dr. Kang Hui (see photo), an American public utilities expert recently hired to help improve traffic in the city, and asked for his opinion on the current state of traffic in Shanghai. He smiled bitterly and said, "Very bad," adding that he had never seen any city with so many rickshaws and pedicabs crowding the streets as Shanghai. The reporter asked whether the excessive number of rickshaws was the biggest cause of traffic disorder in the city, and whether they should be banned. He replied that he could not answer that question yet. The reporter also asked whether he had already devised concrete measures to improve traffic in the city. Dr. Kang Hui said that he had not brought any plans from the United States, as purely theoretical and abstract plans cannot be adapted to Shanghai's reality. His task is to examine the current state of Shanghai's traffic, conduct a comprehensive study, identify the root causes of the problems, and then prescribe the right medicine, proposing concrete measures to the municipal government for reference in improving traffic. He said that he inspected various districts within four or five hours of arriving in China, and yesterday morning he also visited the city's tram company, holding a review meeting with senior officials. Their initial work will continue to involve inspecting various public utility institutions, serving as basic data for research and discussion.</p>
<p>Streetcars Will Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Dr. Kang Hui told the reporter that the three major transportation tools in the United States are streetcars, trackless trolleys, and buses. In recent years, streetcars have been gradually phased out. He said that Shanghai may also adopt this trend, as streetcars have become outdated, which is a fact. He also knows that the current Mayor of Shanghai is not satisfied with streetcars, so this issue is worthy of study.</p>
<p>When asked whether building "tunnels" would be a good solution to Shanghai's traffic problems, Dr. Kang Hui's answer was straightforward: "Absolutely impossible." Building one mile of tunnel would cost 5 to 6 million U.S. dollars, and the Shanghai municipal government has no money. Where would the tunnels be built? He believes that although tunnels can solve some traffic problems because underground trains are incredibly fast, the cost is too high, and it is too early to talk about it.</p>
<p>Streets Too Narrow, Demolishing Houses Difficult</p>
<p>Dr. Kang Hui believes that many of the city's streets are indeed too narrow, which greatly affects traffic. However, he understands that this problem cannot be solved in the short term, because if houses are demolished and rebuilt, it would disrupt the residents' peace, and the municipal government does not have such vast funds. If the money were taken from the citizens, thereby increasing the burden on the citizens, it would not be feasible at present.</p>
<p>Finally, Dr. Kang Hui said that, in short, after fully understanding the traffic situation in Shanghai, he would make concrete recommendations to the municipal government to ensure that Shanghai's traffic moves towards a more rational and civilized state in the future. He said, "Make the vehicles on the road run faster, so that people can go home earlier!"</p>
<h3>Appeal in Racecourse Bond Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In the case of the Racecourse bond repayment, after the District Court ruled to increase the payment by a factor of one thousand, the defendant, Fan Keling, the legal representative of the Racecourse General Association, appealed to the High Court. The lawyers representing the appellants, Di Bais and others, also filed a cross-appeal in court, requesting that the one-thousand-fold increase ruled by the First Instance be increased to three thousand times based on foreign exchange adjustments. The High Court concluded its hearing and issued its verdict yesterday morning, the main text of which read: "The appeal and cross-appeal are both dismissed, and the litigation costs of the Second Instance shall be borne by both parties."</p>

<h3>Female Companion Noticed Hiding, Escaped After Robbery and Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 7:45 PM last night, three thieves broke into the home of Song Lansheng, who runs a coal business at 101 Yongcheng Lane, Dongdaming Road, Hudong. One of them was carrying a handgun. They stole a gold wire bracelet, a diamond ring, a wedding ring, and a flower ring before fleeing with the stolen goods. At that time, one of Song's daughters followed them and reported to the traffic police, who relayed the information to the Tilanqiao Precinct. Section Chief Ma immediately led officers Yu Yingkai and Chen Yaguan in a police car to Yuging Lane on Changzhi Road. Based on the daughter's instructions, they arrested one of the bandits at the end of the lane. The suspect identified himself as Feng Dingliang, 31 years old. He confessed that his two accomplices were Ye Jiakuan and Chen Aqing, both from Ningbo. Aqing had the gun. They resided in room 11 of the Xinhua Hotel at 3, Lane 12, Fujian Road. The investigating officers went to the aforementioned location and apprehended Ye Jiakuan. Chen Aqing is still at large.</p>
<h3>Factory Director and Others at World Book Company Printing Plant Suspected of Collaborating with the Enemy, Parties Accuse Each Other During Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Xue Juemin, the factory director of the Dalianwan Road printing plant of the World Book Company, his deputy Shen Lianfang, and employee Zhou Xiangyun, were accused of collaborating with the enemy by Wang Furou (also known as Wang Fuchou), the chief of the plant's engineering section. Xue and others counter-accused Wang Furou of stealing books and making false accusations out of spite. Yesterday, all four defendants, Xue, Shen, Zhou, and Wang, were interrogated in the High Court. According to the prosecutor's indictment, Xue Juemin was the accountant for the World Book Company's investment group stationed at the plant. During the war of resistance, the Dalianwan Road printing plant of the World Book Company was occupied by the enemy and renamed the Huazhong Printing Bureau. On August 1, 1943, Xue and Zhou Xiangyun, a plant employee fluent in Japanese, negotiated with the Japanese embassy to recover the printing plant. After taking over, Xue became the de facto factory director, and Shen Zhangfang, the plant's manager, became the deputy factory director. Zhou also held an important position, liaising with the enemy. Together, they handled the plant's business, printing false national textbooks and enemy army military tutorials for the puppet China United Publishing Company, as well as organizational charts of the Chongqing party, government, and military. Wang Furou was the chief of the plant's engineering section and also helped in a department. During yesterday's court hearing, the defendants accused each other. The hearing was adjourned, and all four defendants were released on their original bail.</p>
<h3>War Criminal Kurosawa Trial Concluded, Countless Crimes Committed in Hangzhou, Overwhelming Evidence but Still Trying to Deny</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Kurosawa Tsuguo, a Japanese war criminal, was formerly a special commissioner of the Japanese pacification unit in Hangzhou. During the occupation period, he arbitrarily killed people, committing heinous crimes. Yesterday, the First Pacification District Military Tribunal held a hearing, scheduled to pronounce the verdict at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>Kurosawa Tsuguo is a graduate of Waseda University in Tokyo. On August 23, 1937, he enlisted in the army. The following year, he came to China with the army, was assigned to the Tsuchihashi unit of the 22nd Japanese Division, stationed in Hangzhou. After completing his term of service in August and September 1940, he was "entrusted" by the Tsuchihashi unit's staff department to carry out intelligence work. At the same time, he organized a pacification work team, which was known to the people in the occupied areas as the Kurosawa unit. The unit was led by the defendant and consisted of a general team and three detachments, with a large number of personnel, possessing over 400 rifles, over 100 short guns, and over a dozen machine guns. They were often stationed in the areas of Jianqiao, Genshanmen, Qibao, Pengjiabu, Xiashi, and Xucun in Hangzhou, and their activities extended as far as Jinhua and Lanxi. From its establishment on November 3, 1940, the unit began killing five people in the second month. Thereafter, it killed people once or twice a month, totaling over 120 people. The families of the deceased who can be traced are Yang Xiaomao, Yu Tangchun, Yu Quan'gen, and "Hemp Skin Tiger". The Kurosawa unit also murdered fifty to sixty people on the vegetable field cultivated by Yang Tongsheng at the Shengdi Temple in Beiyutan. Some were killed with knives. Zhou Shaojun, a civilian forced to bury the bodies at the time, can testify to this. In 1941, the unit continuously killed twenty-seven people, who were all buried in Beiyutan. Among those killed, including Lu Ziqing, there was a woman who was killed by the defendant himself with a machine gun. One person who was shot but not killed was buried alive by the defendant. This was personally testified to by Zhang A'gen, who was forced to bury the bodies at the time. Su Ronghe, the former acting county magistrate of Hangzhou, was also arrested and taken to Genshanmen for execution but was fortunately released. He witnessed many Chinese soldiers being tied up at the scene, and the defendant's unit had shovels and other burial equipment. As for the military and government personnel killed who can be investigated, there are over forty people, including Tang Maolin, the captain of the anti-Japanese self-defense unit, and Shen Peizeng, an intelligence officer of the 10th Army Group. The Kurosawa unit, stationed in the Hangzhou County area, had lax discipline. Killing, arson, rape, and looting were countless.</p>
<p>After the victory, the criminal hid in the Hangzhou Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Office. He was arrested and interrogated by the Zhejiang Higher Court Prosecutor's Office, which sent prosecutors to inspect the execution site outside Genshanmen. Sixty-one relatively complete skeletons were excavated. After forensic examination, it was determined that eighteen had died from knife wounds, thirteen from blunt force trauma, seventeen from gunshot wounds, and eight had been buried alive. The criminal was subsequently transferred by the Zhejiang Higher Prosecutor's Office together with the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters to the military tribunal for formal prosecution as a war criminal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, based on Kurosawa's confession at the Zhejiang Higher Prosecutor's Office (in which he admitted to killing over thirty people under orders from the staff department), the court conducted a stern interrogation and presented photographs of the excavated skeletons, maps of the execution site, and old forensic identification reports. However, the criminal overturned his previous confession and denied everything. After arguments by the prosecutor and defense lawyer, the court adjourned the hearing to the 17th for the verdict. Kurosawa was wearing a black suit with tortoiseshell glasses, looking refined and gentle. At first glance, one would hardly have thought that he was a murderous demon.</p>

<h3>Fifty-Eight Associations, Including Rubber and Hardware, Petition the Direct Tax Bureau, Director Lou States Extension of Reporting Deadline Will Be Submitted and Approved Based on Facts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Fifty-eight units of industrial and commercial associations in this city, including rubber, hardware, and department stores, reported that the Direct Tax Bureau had set a deadline of March 15 of this year for reporting business income tax for the 36th year. The various industry associations, citing the short deadline and their inability to complete the reporting on time, petitioned the Direct Tax Bureau yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Representatives Zhao Xianji, Hong Nianzu, Ba Lingyun, Wang Jingdong, and Cai Hezhang, among others, requested the simplification of tax collection procedures and an extension of the reporting deadline. Director Lou received them and explained that the deadline was ordered by the Supreme National Defense Council, and the bureau had no authority to change it. Lou also explained: The Supreme National Defense Council has explicitly instructed that those who, for special reasons, are unable to complete the settlement on time may, with the approval of the competent tax collection authority, estimate the amount of income tax payable and first pay 50% of it. The extended deadline for the settlement report shall not exceed April 15. To show consideration for the difficulties of businesses, Lou stated that he could submit the request for review and approval based on the facts. However, he still hoped that all businesses would comply with the regulations and report before the deadline of March 15. The representatives left around 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Retrial of Collision Case, Relatives of Deceased Cai Zhiling Will Sue for Damages</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The District Court reopened the case of the collision between the Zhijiang and Huatonger ships yesterday, summoning witnesses Jiang Lexing (second mate of the Zhijiang), Yu Guiqing (person in charge of the No. 305 iron barge towed by the Huatong), Bao Maoju (engineer of the Huatong), and the relatives of the victims, Cai Chengguan. The defendants, Xin Chengfang and Zhang Jinsheng, also appeared in court. In addition, Li Qianwang, the manager of the Tongji Shipping Company, to which the Zhijiang ship belonged, was also summoned for questioning because of his civil liability. According to Jiang Lexing, two minutes before the accident, he saw the Huatong ship half a nautical mile away. The Zhijiang ship sounded two whistles because a sailboat was blocking the way, causing the collision with the iron barge towed by the Huatong ship. The court asked about the number of passengers on the Zhijiang ship, and Wang replied that there were about 700 people, although the regulations only allowed for about 300. One person was injured at the scene of the accident. During the rescue, Captain Xin Chengfang and all the crew members did not leave their posts. He also stated that after the accident, he went to the bottom cabin and searched. Seeing that no one was there, he left the cabin. Yu Guiqing stated that the No. 305 iron barge he was in charge of was tied to the left side of the Huatong ship. The iron barge had a red light on it. The No. 45 iron barge was on the right side and also had a green light. Two to three minutes after hearing the Huatong ship sound its whistle, the collision occurred, and the No. 305 was also damaged. Bao Maoju stated that he was responsible for driving the Huatong ship's engine. After hearing the whistle, he slowed down and then stopped, immediately reversing to give way, but the Zhijiang ship still crashed into them. Cai Chengguan stated that his uncle, Cai Zhiling, was seriously injured on the spot during the accident and was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment at 6:00 AM the next morning, but he died at 9:00 AM. The victim had 2.5 million yuan in cash and a lot of luggage. He will file a civil lawsuit demanding compensation. Li Qianyu stated that after the accident, the Jianghai Customs sent divers into the sunken ship to retrieve some of the luggage, but no bodies were found, so he was unwilling to bear the responsibility for compensation. After a brief interrogation, the defendants Xin Chengfang and Zhang Jinsheng were released on their original bail. The retrial was adjourned to another date.</p>
<h3>Public Utility Prices to Be Adjusted and Announced Soon</h3>
<p>The Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to increase the allocation price of coal from 145,000 yuan per catty to 210,000 yuan. The Public Utilities Bureau feels that after the price of coal increases, public utilities such as electric lights, gas, trams, and ferries will inevitably increase in price; otherwise, they will not be able to sustain themselves. Seeing this, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau specifically requested instructions from the mayor yesterday. It is reported that the mayor has already approved the adjustment, and the multiple of the adjustment will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Fooled by a House-Topping Scam, How Can Ninety Taels of Gold Be Thrown Away?</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Mao Zizhang, who lives at No. 39 Zhao Villa, Changning Road, found his residence too cramped. Early last month, he discussed topping a house at No. 1322 Fuxing Middle Road from Xiang Jin, agreeing on a topping fee of 90 taels of gold, to be paid in one lump sum.

<h3>Passenger Aircraft Resumption Not Yet Ordered, Candidate for General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation Finalized, Shanghai-Philippines Air Route to Resume Soon</h3>
<p>As of yesterday, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) had not yet received an order from the Ministry of Communications regarding the resumption of domestic passenger flights. The Ministry of Communications has also not yet made a decision on the adjustment of ticket prices. As for the selection of a successor for the General Manager of CNAC, it is rumored that the Ministry of Communications has indeed finalized the selection and will appoint Liu Jingyi. However, Mr. Liu has not yet returned to China, and all business is still being managed by General Manager Shen Dexie. Also, due to the small area of the Grace Park Airport in Manila leased for the Shanghai-Philippines route, although international passenger routes have resumed, passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and the Philippines has not been smooth. Now, CNAC, through various efforts, has successfully negotiated the lease of the large Makati Airport in Manila for aircraft operations. Therefore, passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and the Philippines will officially resume in the near future.</p>
<p>[San Bao News] The Civil Aeronautics Administration will establish an office in this city to strengthen the management of civil aviation organizations. Senior official Lin has been sent to Shanghai to oversee the preparations.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Questions</h3>
<p>Partnership Split</p>
<p>Jiang Zisheng asked: A, B, and C jointly opened a business twenty years ago with a capital of 120,000 yuan, 40,000 yuan per person. The shop went bankrupt in the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1936], and after offsetting all the capital, it still owed debts. A and B paid 10,000 yuan. Now, the shop is sold in the current year for 2 million yuan. How should this amount be distributed? (1) Should it be divided proportionally based on the initial investment and the additional payments? (2) Can the additional payments from the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1936] be returned first, adjusted for inflation, and the remainder be divided according to the initial investment? However, if the inflation-adjusted value of the additional payments exceeds the value of the shop, how should the remaining amount be handled legally?</p>
<p>Also, A, B, C, and D organized a charitable association (for activities such as providing coffins and distributing grain) twenty years ago. A contributed the most, 25,000 yuan, B contributed 20,000 yuan, C contributed 3,000 yuan, and D contributed 2,000 yuan, totaling 50,000 yuan. A invested the funds in a company, and A held the stock certificate. The company went bankrupt in the current year. A's son (because A is deceased) intends to invest the funds in another company. (1) Can he proceed without consulting B, C, and D? If one of B, C, or D objects, will it be effective? (2) Should he first consult with B, C, and D before proceeding? (3) If B, C, and D do not agree to invest in another company, can A's son withdraw A's share and invest it elsewhere?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Mi Xitong's Answer] (1) Calculate the proportion based on the cost of living index of the initial capital and the additional payments at the time. (2) It is unreasonable to first return the additional payments. The 2 million yuan from the shop value should be distributed accordingly. Also, (1) No, it should be based on the majority. (2) Yes. (3) A's share can only be withdrawn and invested elsewhere with the consent of B, C, and D.</p>

<h3>National Standard Textbooks: Seven-Union Continues to Print and Supply</h3>
<p>Production costs soar, piracy disappears</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The printing and supply situation of the current term's national standard primary and secondary school textbooks has led to a surge in piracy in various places due to the announcement of open copyright. However, recently, as paper prices and printing labor costs have soared, the textbook prices, the Ministry of Education has adopted a price-limiting policy, freezing them along with the January cost of living index, only allowing sales at 94 times the fixed price. All sales revenue is far from enough to cover the direct cost of book production. As a result, pirates in various places have suddenly stopped their operations, and those who had purchased cheap paper are also hoarding paper and no longer printing books. In view of this, the Ministry of Education has specifically notified the Seven-Union Office, hoping that it will still be fully responsible for the supply before June of this year. It is heard that the original method of the Seven-Union Office was to allocate and transport fixed quantities according to the education statistics of various provinces and cities. However, it has been greatly affected by piracy, price fluctuations, transportation, military affairs, and other factors, making it impossible to adjust surpluses and deficiencies, or to compensate for shortages with surpluses. Therefore, some areas have a large surplus of books, while other areas still feel a shortage. Recently, in order to fulfill its final obligation to the national standard edition, the Seven-Union Office increased printing by more than ten million copies at the end of last month to help the Northeast, Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, and other book-deficient areas. With transportation in the Central Plains disrupted, special arrangements have been made with the China National Aviation Corporation for air transport. All books have now been shipped and are accompanied by teaching guides. If there is a shortage of books in various places, they can be purchased from the Shanghai branches of the office. The actual selling price is still only 94 times the fixed price.</p>

<h3>Chinese Students Studying in the United States: Graduates of Missionary Universities Account for 40 Percent</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 10th] A report from the United Board for Christian Colleges in China stated that the total losses suffered by the thirteen Christian universities in China during the war amounted to at least fifteen million US dollars. Among them, eleven universities fell into the hands of the Japanese army. The report stated that many of the buildings of the eleven universities were destroyed by artillery fire, and most of the others were missing doors and windows. The equipment in the libraries and laboratories, as well as the drainage pipes and electrical installations, were all removed. At the end of the war, only St. John's University in Shanghai and West China Union University in Chengdu remained intact. The other eleven universities were in temporary school buildings in the interior. However, the number of students enrolled in eight schools from 1945 to 1946 was 11,020, almost twice the pre-war level.</p>
<p>The United Board report also stated that more than 40 percent of Chinese students pursuing further education in the United States are graduates of Christian universities in China. Almost three-quarters of all effective scientific work in Chinese agriculture has been completed by Christian universities. Christian universities also pay attention to women's education, and two of them have facilities for women's liberal arts education in China.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Provincial Department of Education Orders the Promulgation of Measures for Integrating Military, Agricultural, and Rural Education, Applicable to Counties Implementing the New Village System on a Trial Basis</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan] In order to effectively establish schools in every village and enroll everyone in school in the model counties implementing the military-agricultural system and the counties implementing the new village system on a trial basis in Shanxi Province, to complete the six-year village education required for national compulsory education, the Department of Education has specially formulated the "Taiyuan County Implementation Measures for Six-Year Military-Agricultural Village Education," which is promulgated for implementation. These measures are applicable to model counties implementing the military-agricultural system and counties implementing the new village system on a trial basis. The following is an exploration of the key points: (1) According to the fact that there are 14 newly compiled townships in a county, with a definite number of 10,784 school-age children, calculated at 50 students per class, a total of 216 classes should be set up. Each township should set up a central national school, except for the central national school in Chengguan Township, which has 21 classes, the rest of the townships should set up 15 classes per school (if the residential villages in each township are far apart or have a large population, national schools or national branch schools may be set up separately, subject to the supervision and guidance of the central national school). Based on the estimated differences in the number of school-age children in each year, 72 senior classes and 144 junior classes should be set up. With the class system, no matter whether it is senior or junior, each class should have 50 students as the standard. Senior classes with less than 25 students are not allowed to open classes, and classes are only allowed to be split if there are more than 75 students. Senior classes may adopt compound teaching, and junior classes may adopt single-grade teaching. Each two senior classes should have three teachers, and each junior class should have one teacher, totaling 252 teachers. In addition to the current 138 teachers, there is a shortage of 114 teachers, who will be selected and trained from the outstanding personnel laid off from the county, district, and village cadres this time. (2) Teacher salaries: The principal of the central national school is appointed at the sixth grade, with a monthly salary of 120 yuan; the director of teaching is appointed at the seventh grade, with a monthly salary of 110 yuan; senior teachers are appointed at the eighth grade, with a monthly salary of 100 yuan; junior teachers are appointed at the ninth grade, with a monthly salary of 90 yuan, totaling 108 senior teachers and 144 junior teachers. However, the salaries of the principals, directors of teaching, and senior teachers are allocated by the county as a whole. As for the salaries of junior teachers, they should be handled by the residents of each township themselves according to the current regulations, and the school board should be responsible for handling it. (3) Temporary expenses: The grain rent that each township's residential villages should receive from the old school land divided into shares should be used as the temporary expenses for the senior classes of the central school in each township (if the grain rent is too much or insufficient, or if there is none, the county may give or allocate it appropriately according to actual needs). As for the temporary expenses for junior classes, they should still be raised by the residents of each township themselves. (4) Equipment expenses: Based on the actual needs of school equipment in the residential villages of each township, the people should bear it fairly, and in accordance with the regulations on donating funds to schools, the public should be encouraged to donate generously. (5) Public miscellaneous book expenses: 14,000 yuan per month for each senior class, allocated by the county as a whole; 1,400 yuan per month for each junior class, raised by the residents of each township themselves, and may be paid in kind. (6) Senior classes in each central national school should set up vocational classes to subsidize poor children in each school with the income from on-site production. (7) In addition to using the provincial-compiled military-agricultural national language common sense, national standard textbooks will be temporarily used, and the province will edit and supplement military-agricultural teaching materials at any time.</p>
<h3>Self-funded Students Will Sue Song and Bei, Presenting Three Reasons</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The second batch of self-funded students in this city sent representatives to Beijing at the end of November last year to petition for the settlement of foreign exchange at the old exchange rate, but to no avail. Then, on February 18 this year, they petitioned again. At that time, President Song of the Executive Yuan promised to reply in two weeks. However, only three days after the petition, the central government ordered the suspension of passport issuance. Later, President Song and the Governor of the Central Bank resigned one after another, resulting in the failure of the second petition. The self-funded students were greatly indignant, believing that former President Song and former Governor Bei had failed to fulfill their promises, causing great losses to more than a thousand students. Recently, it has been decided that the self-funded students will jointly submit a formal petition, and in accordance with legal procedures, request the Control Yuan to impeach Song and Bei, and at the same time file an administrative lawsuit.</p>
<p>According to Ling Shuang, Vice Chairman of the Self-funded Students Association, who told reporters yesterday, the association has three reasons for impeaching and suing Song and Bei: (1) The Ministry of Education held the self-funded student examination in July last year. This is an established national policy that should be implemented. However, Mr. Song went against it and did not approve the application of the admitted students for foreign exchange settlement at the old exchange rate, and now he has suspended the issuance of passports, meaning that he is not allowed to go abroad. These contradictory and improper measures constitute one of the derelictions of duty. (2) After the results of the self-funded student examination were released, the students requested to settle foreign exchange at the old exchange rate. During the first petition, President Song, Governor Bei, and various ministries shirked responsibility. Mr. Song even knew that the exchange rate would change but ignored it, causing great economic losses to the students. This is the third dereliction of duty. (3) After the first self-funded student examination, the government clearly stipulated that those who had not passed the Ministry of Education's examination would not be allowed to go abroad in the future. The students knew to abide by national laws and regulations. However, according to statistics from the Ministry of Education, between the first and second examinations, more than 1,000 people went abroad without passing the examination. At the same time, President Song's own three daughters and the Governor's three sons all went abroad privately without taking the examination. Song and Bei promulgated laws and regulations but violated them themselves, which is indeed a corruption of power.</p>
<p>Currently, the Self-funded Students Association is hiring lawyers and experts to prepare the lawsuit procedures and will publish a formal petition in the near future. On the one hand, they are still requesting Song and Bei to continue to ask the newly reorganized government to settle foreign exchange at the 3,350 exchange rate and to restore the issuance of passports for going abroad. If this is not allowed, they will request Song and Bei to compensate all students for the full examination fee and the full difference in expenses between the 3,350 and 12,000 exchange rates for each person. It is said that some students came from afar to take the examination, even leaving their homes and jobs. Now that they cannot go abroad, their expenses are exhausted and they feel extremely miserable.</p>

<p>The Jiading Public Education Center recently held a celebration for the completion of its new building. They specially invited the Shanghai Bank basketball team, the champion of the Shanghai banking community, to compete against the county high school team. They also invited Xuebai and Qinglian Youth League, two strong women's basketball teams from the city, to perform. A group of fifty people departed from Shanghai at 8:30 AM in two Shanghai Bank vehicles and arrived in Jiading city at 10:00 AM. They were immediately accompanied by Qin Zhigan, the director of the Public Education Center, and Mei Bichang, the director, for a tour. They had lunch at the center and rested briefly before the competition started in the afternoon at the sports field. The game details are as follows:</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the Shanghang team first played against the county high school team. The referee was Jin Botao. The wind was extremely strong that day. The Shanghang team was not used to playing away from home. The county high school team relied on their familiarity with the local conditions. Zhang Yaochang scored the first point for the county. After a 6-6 tie, the Shanghang team gradually got into the game and ended the first half with a score of 11-6. In the second half, the county high school team fought back hard, but they repeatedly fouled due to a misunderstanding of the three-second rule. The Shanghang team eventually won with a score of 20-16.</p>
<p>Shanghang Team Fouls Points County High School Team Fouls Points</p>
<p>Wang Wanchun 0 2 Zhang Yaochang 2 6</p>
<p>Huo Ming 0 4 Lv Dongliang 1 2</p>

<p>Zhou Fukuan 1 9 Wu Jingguang 3 0</p>
<p>Cheng Shining 1 1 Shen Hongyu 2 6</p>
<p>Total 3 20 Total 9 天</p>
<p>After the game, the two women's teams of Xuebai and Qinglian Youth League performed. The referee was Zhu Mingxing. Because it was a performance, both sides tried their best to show their strengths and did not care about winning or losing. The performances of Wang Huilin, Zhang Xiuli, Sun Fengzhu, and Liu Huishan were praised by the locals for their excellent skills, which were considered no less than those of men. In the end, they each scored 17 points, resulting in a draw. The entire team returned to Shanghai at 5:00 PM, and the Shanghang team returned in triumph.</p>
<h3>Philippine Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Anborn Wins Singles Championship</p>
<p>[United Press Manila, 9th] Philippine tennis giant and Davis Cup player Anborn defeated Far Eastern University player Sanchez today with scores of 6-4, 6-0, and 6-2, retaining the 1947 national singles championship.</p>
<h3>Davis Cup Player Cai Huiquan to Participate in Hong Kong Tennis Tournament, Scheduled to Begin on March 10th</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter, Hong Kong Dispatch] The annual Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament has been suspended for five consecutive years since 1941. Although it was restored last year, many talented Hong Kong and Chinese tennis players were either working abroad, had not yet returned to Hong Kong, or had not practiced for a long time and were unable to participate. Therefore, it was delayed until this year to resume officially. When the tennis tournament started accepting registrations, people in the tennis community speculated whether Cai Huiquan, our country's Davis Cup player, would also join in the fun. Considering the current tennis talent in Hong Kong and China, Cai Huiquan should be able to dominate. However, the Xu brothers, Huipai and Peirun, are also experts and won the Hong Kong tennis championship in 1941. In addition, Jiang Daozhang, He Jialiu, and Li Huitang were all outstanding players. Jiang Daozhang is also a veteran of the Davis Cup. Foreign tennis experts include the Indian Lin brothers (Xiao Linzhen and Da Linzhen), who have a good reputation. Some British officers have also registered for this competition. Their skills have not yet been revealed in the Hong Kong tennis community, and it is difficult to predict their abilities. However, in any case, the championship of this competition will always belong to Chinese men, and foreigners should not even think about it. A total of 39 people have registered for the singles competition, and 29 pairs have registered for the doubles competition. The competition is scheduled to start on March 10th. At that time, there will be fierce competition on the green lawn of the Hong Kong Cricket Club. In the eyes of Hong Kong people, tennis is considered a "high-class" sport, unlike football, which is enjoyed by all. However, there are still many talented tennis players in Hong Kong and China, and their level seems to be higher than that of Beijing and Shanghai. However, it is not as popular as in Beijing and Shanghai, which is a drawback. Cai Huiquan was originally scheduled to go to England for business reasons recently. If the matter is urgent and cannot be postponed, then he will not be able to participate in this competition.</p>

<h3>International Trade Community Discusses Import-Export Linking System</h3>
<p>The International Trade Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the local Import and Export Trade Association held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to discuss the import-export linking system. The goal was to explore its potential contribution after the implementation of the new foreign exchange control measures to alleviate the difficulties currently faced by import trade, which has been completely stagnated. Chairman Shou Jingwei gave a detailed account of the examples of import-export linking systems in various countries and the barter of production raw materials (such as American cotton) with exported manufactured goods (such as cotton textiles exported to Southeast Asia). Subsequently, Ge Jiecun, Li Zongwen, Qiu Liangrong, Tang Jisan, Zhang Xiangfu, Ye Xuxin, Ding Wushi, Shen Gengyuan, Cai Jianwen, Cai Xintao, Yao Nai'an, Wang Dong, Pan Shihao, Zheng Fangzheng, Li Zhenming, Tu Tianjin, and Li Shoulu, among other committee members, analyzed and studied in detail the advantages and disadvantages of the linking system and the points to be noted during its implementation. It was also decided to discuss the "Draft Adjustment of Import and Export Trade Measures" proposed by Mr. Luo Qinghua, the standing director of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, next Thursday (the 13th) and Saturday (the 15th) to gather wisdom and develop a practical and feasible plan for the government and financial authorities to adopt.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Government bonds finally rose yesterday. The 1937 Unified Bonds opened at 8,800 yuan and were immediately sought after, rising to 10,300 yuan before slightly consolidating. The black market price rose to 10,500 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Classes A and B rose by 1,200, Class C rose by 1,300, Class D rose by 2,000, and Class E rose by 1,700. The turnover was about 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Eight Types of Government Bonds Drawn for Redemption</h3>
<p>Deadline for Supplementary Payment of Overdue Principal and Interest is End of the Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance held a lottery for the redemption of government bonds on the fourth floor of 74 Renji Road. The bonds included the Class B bonds of the 1936 Unified Bonds, the 1928 Financial Long-Term Bonds, the 1936 Reorganization of Guangdong Financial Bonds, the 1936 Sichuan Rehabilitation Bonds, the 1937 Guangdong Province Harbor and River Engineering US Dollar Bonds, the Class A bonds of the 1939 Construction Bonds, the Class B bonds of the 1939 Military Bonds, and the Class C bonds of the 1941 Military Bonds. All winning bonds should have their principal redeemed, except for the 1937 Guangdong Province Harbor and River Engineering US Dollar Bonds, because the Guangdong Customs surtax, which was designated as the redemption and interest payment fund for this bond, was robbed by the enemy and could not be paid. The principal and interest will be temporarily suspended, and the date of resumption of repayment will be determined separately after the bond fund is cleared. In addition, Director Chen reported on the spot that for bondholders of various government bonds in the recovered areas, who were unable to collect the principal and interest within the prescribed three-year period during the war due to the situation, the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect the interests of all bondholders, had previously announced that it would be specially approved for supplementary payment before the end of last year. If the payment was not collected after the deadline, it would be invalidated in accordance with the regulations. Later, at the request of various banks, the supplementary payment period was extended to the end of March of this year. Now that the supplementary payment period is about to expire, bondholders are urged to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Private Applications for Foreign Exchange Will Not Be Accepted</h3>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank recently issued a circular to designated foreign exchange banks, stipulating that they should not accept foreign exchange applications in the name of private individuals in the future. In addition, exporters who entrust sales of export products should sell foreign exchange to designated banks within the prescribed period.</p>
<h3>Barter Negotiations with Japan: In Addition to Pit Props and Rayon, Hope to Supply Large Quantities of Newsprint</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The commissioners sent by the Executive Yuan to Japan to negotiate barter matters will return to the country soon. As of this time, Japan has agreed to supply China with 4 million pit props and 3 million pounds of rayon. China has agreed to supply Japan with 1 million tons of salt, but it is not yet possible to say whether it can be supplied in full. Newsprint is a commodity urgently needed by China, and it is hoped that Japan can supply it in large quantities. However, according to relevant sources, Japan is carrying out the "democratization" of education under the guidance of the Allied Headquarters. Old textbooks have been discarded, and new textbooks are being printed urgently. It needs a large amount of newsprint itself, so it is questionable whether there will be any surplus for export. Only 500 reams have been shipped to China. Regarding the large number of locomotives and carriages that China urgently needs, it is still difficult to achieve in the short term because China cannot supply Japan with large quantities of coal and iron raw materials. However, a small amount of piecemeal supply is still possible.</p>
<p>Also, news: Barter trade with the Soviet Union is an act of China repaying wartime debts, which is divided into two parts: one is the tungsten sand from the Resources Committee, and the other is the ordinary materials exported by the China Trust Bureau, such as tung oil and pig bristles. Last year, the value of goods repaid to the Soviet Union by the China Trust Bureau was only US$10.05 million. The amount to be repaid this year is still in the stage of requesting instructions and seeking the consent of the Soviet Union. However, according to relevant sources, the amount of repayment this year will not exceed last year due to China's current poor economic situation. This repayment work will continue until 1952.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchant Representatives Urge Activation of This Year's Tea Loans</h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM this morning, ten tea merchant representatives, including Shou Liangwei, Tang Jisan, Wang Zhenfu, Sun Xiaocun, Wu Juenong, and Hong Chunzhi, will meet with President Zhang Jia'ao of the Central Bank to discuss the following issues: (1) The tea season is approaching, and it is hoped that the tea loans in various provinces this year will be activated quickly. (2) Regarding the tea that has already been purchased, it is hoped that a reasonable price adjustment can be obtained. Regarding the future revaluation, a valuation committee should be formed separately, and the China Trust Bureau should hire tea industry experts to participate.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Ordered to Crack Down on the Black Market; Bull Market Rages in the Chinese Stock Market</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Chinese stocks were still being absorbed by speculative funds yesterday, causing short sellers to cover their positions, and the black market outside the stock market became more profitable. The police bureau has been ordered to take decisive measures and will begin to crack down on the black market soon. Although there was a decline in the afternoon as many people took profits, the miscellaneous stocks still showed vitality and were raised again at the close.</p>

Nos. 181, 177, 152, 112, 180, and 231 took the opportunity to advance at low prices and began to rise back to 3,200 yuan. At this time, various miscellaneous stocks rose to the limit again, showing that the market was still bullish. Although Nos. 91 and 4 were vigorously sold, Nos. 84, 117, 156, 89, and 219 were added to purchase at the close, and the closing price was still pulled up to 3,290 yuan.

<h3>Import Quota for Newsprint Too Small: Actual Monthly Demand is Over 8,000 Tons, but the Current Quota is Only 3,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The market price of newsprint reached 130,000 yuan a week ago. Recently, due to high prices and sluggish sales, the price has gradually declined, generally hovering between 105,000 yuan and 110,000 yuan. Roll newsprint is priced at 2,100 yuan per pound. According to a major foreign paper import company in this city, the company ships about 3,000 tons of newsprint from the United States every month, all of which are customer orders. Each ream costs 60,000 yuan, and each pound of roll paper costs 1,200 yuan. The above prices include transportation costs, import and export tariffs, and insurance. However, the loss of interest during the period from ordering to delivery is not included. In addition, the delivery price of European newsprint at the Shanghai dock (excluding interest loss) is already 90,000 yuan per ream. It is estimated that in 1937, the total import volume of newsprint in this city was about 100,000 tons, or about 8,300 tons per month. At present, the monthly import quota for newsprint in this city is only 3,000 tons, which is far from the actual need. It is estimated that the current demand in this city is at least 7,000 tons per month. Moreover, once traffic in other cities is restored, customers will purchase more actively, and the demand will be even greater. It is estimated that the current inventory of newsprint in this city can last for about three months. At present, the production cost of newsprint in domestic paper mills is 2,500 yuan per pound, which is almost double the ordering price from abroad. The production result is not economical. Therefore, the temporary solution seems to be to consider relaxing the import quota for paper.</p>
<h3>Syndicated Export Bill Discounting: First Group Established, Wah Cheng, Hua Kang, and Seven Other Companies Sign Agreement</h3>
<p>In order to enable commercial banks to help production enterprises and provide them with opportunities for capital turnover, the Central Bank is handling rediscounting and repledging, using the method of commercial banks organizing industrial and commercial loan syndicates. The number of syndicates organized by commercial banks in this city has reached more than ten groups, with a total of more than 9 billion yuan loaned out. All of them are rediscounted or repledged to the Central Bank at 75% of the original loan amount. In order to encourage the circulation of materials, the bank has also handled repledging of export bills based on the established methods. The export bill discounting syndicates are still organized by commercial banks to apply for repledging from the Central Bank. It is reported that seven Sichuan banks, including Mei Fung, Wah Cheng, Tung Wai, Hua Kang, Chi Kang, Agricultural &amp; Industrial, and Hui Tung, have completed the organization of the first export bill discounting syndicate and formally signed an agreement. The task of the syndicate is to be responsible for reviewing various loans and negotiating with the Central Bank to allow repledging. The export goods pledged by the syndicate members must be limited to daily necessities for people's livelihood and local specialty export commodities, and they must be responsible for guaranteeing that the loan is entirely for the legitimate industrial and commercial needs of the debtors and will not be used for other purposes. The maximum amount of claims submitted to the syndicate by each member is 400 million national currency, and the repledging is calculated at 75%, that is, limited to 300 million national currency. The total amount of loans to industrial and commercial enterprises by each member shall not exceed 100 million national currency. The monthly interest rate on loans is 5%, with a term of 30 days. The discount on export goods is calculated at a maximum of 70% of the market price at the place of origin. The syndicate is jointly and severally liable for the debts owed to the Central Bank by all members. The syndicate will enter into a repledging agreement with the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Cooking Oil Continues to be Rationed</h3>
<p>According to the Cooking Oil Joint Distribution Office, the office has decided to continue to supply cooking oil to retail oil shops this week after consultation with oil manufacturers. It is reported that the distribution of oil in the city center will be decided on the 12th of this month, and each shop will be able to purchase one barrel of soybean oil, with the price still being 250,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>(Another News) China Vegetable Oil Factory continued to distribute raw oil to merchants in this city. The numbers distributed were Group C Nos. 401 to 600, who paid the fee yesterday (the 10th). The distribution price was 909,500 yuan per barrel, and the delivery is scheduled for today (the 11th).</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Ordered to Crack Down on Black Market; Bull Market Rages in Chinese Stock Market</h3>
<h3>Rice Market Stagnant, Soybean Oil Price Falls by Ten Thousand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the combined North and South markets saw over 14,600 stones of rice arrive, with sluggish sales and a stagnant market, resulting in a downturn. Japonica rice fell by 21,000 yuan, and medium to lower grades continued to drop by 23,000 yuan. Indica rice also weakened by 12,000 yuan. High-grade white rice saw a slight reduction in fixed prices, while lower grades fell by 12,000 yuan. Transactions were minimal, making a recovery difficult in the short term. Flour was supplied as usual with rationed flour, and goods from inland areas continued to gradually decrease, with further price reductions ranging from 300 to 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran remained firm. The oil market, anticipating the arrival of goods from Qingdao, saw a softening of sentiment and a general decline. Soybean oil fell by 10,000 yuan, crude oil plunged by over 10,000 yuan, and refined oil also followed with a smaller drop of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame oil fell by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yellow beans maintained a stable situation. Soybean cakes from Shantou saw weak demand, and the market was flat. Mung beans remained similar. Red sorghum started firm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon, with prices increasing by 1,000 yuan overall. Corn prices surged at the opening but leveled off by midday, resulting in an overall increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw sluggish demand and continued to weaken by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Sesame seeds remained firm, while broad beans maintained strong sales and stable prices. Red beans were mediocre.</p>
<h3>Fine Yarn Prices Firm and Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market remained calm. Customer sales were still scarce, but there were no signs of weakening sentiment. In particular, 32-count fine yarn saw strong prices due to demand from pure weaving factories. While trading within the market adhered to price limits, private transactions were still unavoidable.</p>
<p>Cotton Fabric Market Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton fabric market was weak because the tonnage of export shipments had been low in recent days, and some goods were stranded. Customer demand was also stagnant, and due to interest rate considerations, many traders were selling off goods. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company supplied all the fabrics requested by applicants on Saturday, leading to a glut of spot goods and a weak market. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth was priced at 156,000 yuan, and "Five Blessings" cloth at 153,500 yuan, a decrease of 1,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth saw little change. Only "Jumping Carp" bleached cloth saw slightly improved demand in the main street and was relatively firm.</p>
<h3>Woolen and Western Clothing Stores Order White Canvas</h3>
<p>Due to high prices and various other factors, actual sales of woolen goods were much lower than at this time in previous years. Most goods owners are importing with difficulty, and goods tax has already been implemented, so public sentiment continues to point upwards. A wide 36-inch domestic white canvas has recently been ordered in large quantities by woolen and Western clothing companies. Over 400 bolts have been ordered through Pei Feng Company at a fixed price of 9,000 yuan per yard, to be delivered within one month. A deposit of 120,000 yuan is paid in advance for each bolt.</p>
<h3>Prices of Oils and Waxes Fluctuate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Today, coconut oil and tallow prices rose again. Asphalt prices were reported to have increased at the origin, but the Shanghai market remained mixed. Coconut oil traded around 450,000 yuan per dan. Bengbu tallow and local tallow were priced between 440,000 and 450,000 yuan per dan. Jiaxing local crude oil was priced at 350,000 yuan per dan. Lanxi and Weiping asphalt were priced between 300,000 and 310,000 yuan per tan. Macheng and Jingbai broken snow saw little trading. Asphalt prices at the origin have all been reported to have increased.</p>
<h3>Qingxu Tobacco Leaf Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to transportation difficulties, the arrival of tobacco leaves from Qingzhou and Xuzhou is very scarce. In the last couple of days, prices have risen sharply across the board. Top-grade Xuzhou tobacco leaves are priced at 7,500 yuan per pound, and medium-grade at 7,000 yuan. Top-grade Xuzhou tobacco leaves are priced at 7,200 yuan per pound, and medium-grade at 6,700 yuan, all of which have increased compared to the previous day. American tobacco remains unchanged, ranging from 70 cents to 1.30 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Soap Factory Prices Surge, Factories Distribute Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the soap market has been stable with a hint of weakness. It is reported that Guben Soap distributed a total of 20,000 boxes, with a factory price of 210,000 yuan. Scissors Soap distributed approximately 3,000 boxes, with a factory price of 210,000 yuan. Xiang'e Soap distributed fewer goods, with the total number once rumored to be 50,000 boxes, but later it was heard that only 5,000 to 6,000 boxes were distributed, with a factory price of 155,000 yuan. Nanyang opened its distribution of wooden bucket foot soap at a price of 30,000 yuan, with a factory price of 40,000 yuan. Although oil and alkali prices have recently fallen, the current factory prices are only enough for the soap factories to maintain production costs.</p>
<h3>Coal Dust Prices Rebound After Falling</h3>
<p>The coal market saw coal dust prices rebound sharply as actual users frequently bought at low prices, leading to a slight strengthening of the market. However, because sellers were asking for too high prices and buyers were unable to meet them, only sporadic urgent users made some spot purchases, and large-scale transactions were still scarce. White coal briquettes arrived at the Jiaozuo Railway Station, and the market also saw a return to stability. The supply and demand of other goods remained stable, and market prices also saw little change.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau to Distribute Second Batch of Artificial Silk</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Property Committee of the Executive Yuan, distributed the second batch of artificial silk for the silk weaving industry this month yesterday (10th). The brands distributed this time included Zaori, Gaoshan, Toyo, Jin Sanma, and Tianqiao, and the prices remained the same. The quantity distributed was approximately 600 boxes, it is said.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Calculation Method for Adjusting Capital of Industrial and Mining Enterprises to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced the "Measures for Adjusting Capital by Reassessing the Value of Fixed Assets of Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Enterprises" on December 28th last year, it was deemed necessary to add supplementary regulations to enable various manufacturers to comply. The Accountants Association of this city actively discussed and provided opinions, and the Ministries of Finance and Economics drafted the "Supplementary Calculation Method." It is expected that the Executive Yuan will discuss it in a meeting in the coming days and then announce its implementation. The full draft proposal obtained from relevant parties is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The "fixed assets" referred to in Article 1 of the Measures include land, buildings, machinery and equipment, models, tools, instruments, furniture, and ships and vehicles.</p>
<p>Shares invested in businesses whose capital has already been adjusted should be listed according to their adjusted share amount and should not be revalued in this enterprise. However, due to time constraints, if the capital of the invested business cannot be adjusted in a timely manner, the maximum amount of the revaluation may be one-fourth of the realizable value of the invested stocks in December of the 25th year of the Republic of China.

<h3>Guangzhou Spring Festival Celebration – Celebrities Appear in Costume – Socialites' Fashion Show – Mrs. Zhang Kuai Plays Xiao Wan – Miss Hu Mu Performs "Striving for National Glory"</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou, 2nd (Airmail) — Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>After dusk on March 1st, the air was filled with spring rain, and the earth was quiet and still. Only the magnificent Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall was packed with people, and the melodious music mixed with laughter and applause, creating an unprecedentedly lively scene. This was the Guangzhou City Party Members' Spring Festival Celebration. In addition to the leaders of Party, government, and military organs, all the city's Party members attended. They gathered together in harmony, like elders, brothers, sisters, and siblings in a large family, filling the huge venue with love and joy. This was truly a rare grand event after the victory and recovery.</p>
<p>The program of the event was not only unusually rich but also unique. The most remarkable thing was that the city's prominent figures appeared on stage in costume to perform plays. Especially unique was the ancient and modern fashion show in which Director Zhang Fakui's wife Liu Jingrong, Chairman Luo Zhuoying's wife Chen Huiqing, and Mayor Ouyang's wife Yi Yunduan, along with dozens of leading socialites, participated. The ancient costume show began with the "Qin" dynasty and ended with the "Qing" dynasty. Each dynasty selected a woman as a representative figure: "Qin" was Xi Shi, "Former Han" was Zhao Jun, "Later Han" was Diao Chan, "Tang" was Yang Guifei, "Song" was Liang Hongyu, "Yuan" was Hua Mulan, "Ming" was Fei Gongren, and "Qing" was Dong Xiaowan. They played the roles of these figures from different eras, appearing on stage in succession. Some wore brilliant costumes, while others wore simple makeup, creating a colorful and diverse spectacle, transporting the audience to historical settings. A moment later, the modern fashion show brought people back to the world of the atomic age.</p>
<p>In the historical costume show, Director Zhang Fakui's wife played Dong Xiaowan of the Qing dynasty, appearing on stage in a pink Qing costume, earning the most enthusiastic cheers from the audience. The modern fashion show of City Councilor Lu Yougang's wife also received a lot of applause. After the fashion show, there was another exciting program: the two-act play "Striving for National Glory" performed by Wu Zhimei, Luo Canqun, Feng Cihong, Mu Yougang, Gao Xin, Zhu Xiuxia, Hu Mulan, and others. The performance of a character in the play that "governed" the country was the most outstanding. This character was played by Zhu Xiuxia, a member of the Central Committee and Director of the Education Bureau. He grasped the personality of the character very well. He was probably around forty years old, but he played the role of an old man with silver whiskers and hair. His attitude was very realistic. It can be regarded as the most successful performance in the play. Wu Zhimei, a member of the Central Committee, also received considerable praise for playing the wife of the scholar.</p>
<p>At this grand event, one had a strong feeling that the advanced elements united with the younger generation. There were indeed many respected Party and government figures, but there were also many more lively, innocent, and young people. Under one principle and one goal, they broke through the boundaries of age and seniority, fully demonstrating love and sincerity. Therefore, although this was a celebration, in addition to achieving the goal of common entertainment, it really had a profound meaning!</p>
<p>Highlights of the meeting: Costume performance</p>

<h3>The Huainan Railway is Full of Spring</h3>
<p>— Jiulonggang, 8th (Quick Report) — Zhe Song</p>
<p>Although the section of the Huainan Railway currently in operation is only over eighty kilometers long, crawling in a corner of northeastern Anhui Province, its mission is no less important than that of the neighboring Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, which are crowded with officials and merchants. Every day, it transports coal produced by the Huainan Coal Mine to Bengbu for transshipment southward to supply fuel for transportation and industry. The people in northern and central Anhui, who have suffered greatly after the war and are impoverished, are able to easily import and export their local products and daily necessities, thanks to its continuous transport day and night. The dilapidated villages along the line are also gradually becoming active.</p>
<p>All that the Huai Railway has left by the Japanese enemy is a fragile shell riddled with wounds. It has also suffered from both man-made and natural disasters – the destruction by arsonists and the scouring by the repeated breaches of the dikes last autumn. However, human effort can overcome nature. Finally, thanks to the tireless efforts of Director Wu Jingqing and the hard work of all employees for a year, and under difficult circumstances with special conditions and a lack of resources, they carefully and bravely treated the symptoms, frequently used acupuncture, started businesses from scratch, and brought the dead back to life, enabling the railway to shoulder a huge mission.</p>
<p>Hefei to Shuijiahu Highway Joint Transportation</p>
<p>Hefei is the capital of Anhui Province after the war. The Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau used the original roadbed of the Huai Road Shuijiahu to Yuxikou, which is about 180 kilometers long, as a temporary highway. However, there were not many vehicles, making it difficult to meet actual demand. In order to help develop transportation, the Huai Road authorities agreed with the General Administration of Highways of the Ministry of Transportation to jointly operate highway transportation from Shuijiahu to Hefei and from Hefei to Yuxikou. Vehicles were supplied by the General Administration of Highways, and the service was launched on October 10th of last year. The service had fixed schedules, fixed seating for passengers, and tight team management, which made travel much more convenient for travelers.</p>
<p>Shuijiahu: Is the connecting station between the highway and the railway, but the place is not a market town. Apart from a few food stalls that sprang up in response to the situation and a few restaurants with thatched roofs, firewood doors, earthen walls, and muddy floors with mixed kitchens, it is difficult to find a slightly clean restaurant where people can eat and rest. In addition to working hard on the "travel" aspect, Huai Road also solved the two major problems of "food" and "rest" for waiting passengers. Next to the newly built Shuijiahu station building, several rooms were opened as a reception center, employing famous chefs to regularly provide meals, dishes, and snacks, and preparing candies and snacks for customers to choose from. Shi Jingchang, the person in charge of the reception center, provided thoughtful service, and the waiters were also polite, making travelers forget the fatigue of the journey and the boredom of waiting for the train, creating a "guests are like home" atmosphere. As soon as one enters the reception center, what is revealed to the traveler is Director Wu's handwritten inscription "Diligence, Integrity, Knowledge of Shame" as instructions for the employees. This not only shows the spirit of the new life movement practiced by Zhun Road, but also shows that it is no accident that Zhun Road has achieved this achievement in a short year.</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang and Vice Minister Ling – Official Visits</p>
<p>Spring has finally arrived in the world. Although it is still inevitable that "spring cold is fierce," it is no longer as terrible as the biting north wind. Because of its relatively remote location, the Huai Road rarely sees official visits. However, recently, General Zhang Wenbo, Director of the Northwest Headquarters and Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and Mr. Ling Zhuming, Vice Minister of Transportation, visited one after another, bringing a lot of spring to the Huai Road and making it feel even more vibrant.</p>
<p>General Zhang took time out of his busy schedule to return to his hometown of Chaoxian County with his wife and others. Although the old home was good, General Zhang, who had a heavy burden on his shoulders, did not allow him to stay there for long. He reluctantly left his hometown on the 18th and went to Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province. After staying in Hefei for one day, he still took a car with Director Wang on the morning of the 20th and headed for Shuijiahu. The Mayor of Bengbu, Li Pinhe, and the Director of the Political Department of the Pacification District, Qiu Guozhen, and others had arrived in Shuijiahu the day before to meet him. When General Zhang's car arrived in Shuijiahu, the special train prepared for General Zhang by the Huai Road – a first-class car manufactured by the road's engine factory, with exquisite equipment and neat arrangement – was already attached behind locomotive No. 108. The road's Director Wu and others had also arrived in advance. At a little past eleven o'clock, General Zhang, who was energetic and had a kind attitude, arrived at the station with his wife. After getting off the car, he shook hands with the welcoming staff one by one to express his gratitude. He was immediately ushered into the reception room. Director Wu first invited him to visit and guide Jiulonggang, but General Zhang politely declined with regret, citing the impossibility of his duties and time. However, from his praise and inquiries about the Huai Road, it can be seen that he was very concerned about it. After being hosted by the Road Bureau for lunch, he shook hands with the public at 12:40 and said goodbye to the people who welcomed him from Bengbu and Hefei, and boarded the train and left the station. At 2:40, this special train of distinguished guests on the Huai Road's maiden voyage arrived in Bengbu.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Pu Fengchen Inspects Huainan</p>
<p>Next, the Huai Road received news that Ling Zhuming, Vice Minister of Transportation, would be leaving to inspect the Jinpu, Longhai, and Huainan lines. This was another scene worth depicting on the Huainan Road. On the 23rd, Vice Director Ning Shufan of the Huai Road led the heads of the engineering and mechanical departments to Bengbu by car to welcome him and to facilitate pointing out everything along the way. The next morning, Vice Minister Ling and his entourage, as well as Shen Wensi, Vice Director of the Jinpu Road and Director of the Puyan Section Management Office, returned south to Bengbu from inspecting the northern section of the Jinpu Road. When the special train entered the station, Vice Director Ning and others immediately went forward to welcome him. The special train then backed into the Huai Road platform and was attached to the first-class car of the Huai Road. This train, with the first-class passenger car of Huainan, the sleeper car of Jinpu, the official affairs vehicle of Longhai, and a special car with windows broken on all sides, gathered different vehicles from the three lines. This was enough to symbolize the "exchange" and "smoothness" of the three lines, and more clearly indicated the course of Ling's inspection this time. The special train was changed to be pulled by the Huai Road locomotive and departed at 6:30. Mr. Ling was energetic. Although he had been traveling all day, he showed no signs of fatigue. The inspection of the various lines and the national policy of revitalizing transportation must have a very big relationship, so the Huai Road authorities and many employees expressed their enthusiasm for the arrival of Mr. Ling and had the hope of "it will benefit our road." For the sake of the order and time of the visit, the special train drove directly to Tianjia'an, the end point of the Huai Road on the Huainan bank.</p>
<p>Tianjia'an Datong Mine is Thriving</p>
<p>Tianjia'an was originally a township. Since the opening of the Huai Road, it has become an important land and water transportation hub. Merchants gather there, and it has gradually prospered, forming a new rising town along the Huai River. During the period of the fall into enemy hands, because the Huainan mining road was used by the enemy, the residents, although living an inhuman life under the oppression of the fierce power, the place still did not lose its importance. After the victory, the wanderers for eight years returned one after another, and it was even more prosperous. The Anhui Tenth District Commissioner's Office was ordered to move here last year. Regarding the development of the city, the special department presided over the matter and convened local people and the Huainan Road and Mining authorities to discuss and plan, which is being implemented step by step. Among the original station buildings of the Huai Road, only three places, this place and Datong Jiulonggang, were fortunately preserved. On the southwest side of the station, two tall factory buildings stand towering, one is the Huainan Power Plant, which supplies electricity to the working places of various parts of the Datong Jiulonggang mining road day and night, as well as electric lights in various places, and the other is the Huainan Flour Mill, which was established not long ago to supply products to the rolling road employees. These are all constructions of the Huainan Mining and Road Company authorities, operating with difficulty, for the purpose of promoting the development of the mining road and local prosperity. After Vice Minister Ling visited them separately, he praised them greatly. At 10:30, the special train returned to Datong.</p>
<p>Before the war, the Datong Coal Mine was operated by the Datong Coal Mine Company, which is nearly five kilometers from the Jiulonggang. After the war, the Huainan and Datong mines were merged and belonged to one of the main mining areas of the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau. All the equipment has been changed during the enemy's occupation. The enemy intended to seize coal quickly, and most of the mining projects were unreasonable, so after the takeover, the Mining Bureau spent a lot of hard work to repair them. Now the output has gradually increased. Whenever Vice Minister Ling visited a place, General Manager Cheng and the Deputy Directors of the Mining Bureau, Li Jing and Hu Shitong, and others described the working conditions of each department in detail. Mr. Ling attached great importance to and cared about it.</p>
<p>New Inspiration for Jiulonggang Engine Factory</p>
<p>At 11:20, the vehicle returned to Jiulonggang Station. They took small Jeeps and drove to the reception center. After resting for a while, they held a public banquet. In a joyful atmosphere, the guests and hosts raised their glasses to congratulate each other. The focus of everyone's conversation was the past history of the Huainan Road and Mining, and the future plans, especially the problem of the restoration of the railway from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou. Director Ling indicated everything very sincerely and frankly because the Huai Road has a close relationship with state-owned and private transportation construction and industrial enterprises, and promised to provide assistance within the possible range. At the public banquet, he and Deputy Director Shen both gave speeches. After the temporary division, General Manager Cheng, Director Wu, and others led the visit to the office. This is a house overlooking the Huainan Mining and Road area, but now the bureaus of the Mining and Road are gradually increasing with the development of business, and it is not enough to allocate them, so the engineering and mechanical departments of the Road Bureau and some parts of the general affairs and transportation departments are all in other houses to work.</p>
<p>After leaving the office, they turned into the Road Bureau's Jiunenggang Engine Factory. Factory Director Liu Xinmin is young and energetic. From his conversation, it can be known that he is a mechanical engineering talent with a clear mind and a pragmatic and hard-working attitude. According to Factory Director Liu's report, when the factory was taken over, the buildings were incomplete, and broken parts were piled up all over the ground. Only one-third of all the machines could be used. After a year of sorting and repairing, all of them are now available. In the early stage of the takeover, the equipment and materials of the engine factory were extremely disorganized. Later, the work departments were adjusted and divided into four shares: general affairs, accounting, materials, and work; and seven work yards: locomotive, vehicle, foundry, forging, boiler, electrical, and mechanical. There are currently 51 employees, 478 technicians and laborers. When visiting, the workers in each work yard were busy doing their respective duties. A great locomotive yard, covering an area of about 1,800 square meters, only had a skeleton when it was taken over. Now it has been repaired and completed, and there are two passenger car frames that are being rushed to install first and second class and third class passenger cars. In addition to being responsible for repairing and manufacturing the vehicles and parts on this road, the factory plans to accept commissioned repairs of parts from outside the world. In this complex situation, it is more than enough to be clear and orderly. In every corner, every worker shows a regular, tidy, and tense spirit. No wonder Vice Minister Ling nodded frequently and praised it without end. The engine factory is next door to the Jiulonggang Engine Section. Stepping into the iron gate, there is a long coal trunk passage. The office and strip car yard are built next to it. It has the same work tension as the engine factory and the same orderliness.</p>
<p>"It is difficult for Liu Tiaoer to attack the Hyacinth," Vice Minister Ling's special train left from Longgang in a long whistle, high military music, and a line of respectful farewells. Although Vice Minister Ling only stayed at Huai Road for half a day, the impressions he gained and the inspiration he gave to Huai Road were very profound.</p>
<p>Editor's note: This newspaper has recorded the work of the Huainan Coalfield Exploration Team of the Mineral Exploration Department of the Resources Committee. According to a letter from reader Yang Wenzun, we learned the details of the team, and we specially transcribed its main points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The original name of the exploration team was the Huainan Coalfield Exploration Team of the Mineral Exploration Department of the Resources Committee. At least five exploration teams have been dispatched from the Mineral Exploration Hall, and we are one of them.</p>
<p>(2) Exploring Huainan is one of the plans of this office for the 35th year of the Republic of China. The report that "Mr. Xie Jiarong's visit to Huainan was only for sightseeing" is obviously hearsay.</p>
<p>(3) The exploration team was led by Yan Shutuan, Deputy Engineer of the Mineral Exploration Department. All the members of the team were sent here by the Exploration Department from Beijing. The Huainan Mining Bureau sent a general affairs officer, a police officer from the Mining Police Station, and six mining police. The exploration team works in the thatched houses of the people for 12 hours a day.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang is one of the members of the exploration team. In addition to actually participating in the work, he enthusiastically pointed out the above situation, which is commendable. We attach this note to express our gratitude.</p>

<p>Attention to Those Purchasing Canned Food</p>
<p>Editor: Recently, cheap milk powder and various canned foods have been sold everywhere in shops and stalls. Aside from canned meals, which are easily detected as rotten or moldy upon opening and thus unlikely to be mistakenly consumed, powdered milk is, in our experience, unreliable. A friend of mine suffering from a lung disease mistakenly consumed this milk and suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension for half a month. Their previously reduced fever increased instead. After repeated investigation, it was discovered that they had mistakenly consumed expired milk. The same occurred after consuming milk powder. I occasionally ate it a few times and also suffered from similar symptoms, but my body is stronger, so it wasn't as severe as for the sick person. Rumor has it that these various canned goods recently came from the Ryukyu Islands, mostly from around 1943, and are now past their expiration date and potentially toxic. We hope citizens will pay attention. Or, we request that the health authorities issue a public notice! (A Shanghai citizen)</p>
<p>Private School Teachers Request Allocation of Goods in Kind</p>
<p>The newspaper reports that private school teachers and cultural figures are excluded from the allocation of goods in kind. This is truly baffling. Are private school teachers not also working for education? Today, prices are rising steadily, and private school teachers' salaries were determined at the beginning of the semester and cannot be adjusted during the semester. Especially in schools in the southern part of the city, which are located in humble alleys, tuition fees cannot be set too high, and the salaries are three or four times lower than in other districts. To this day, a salary of 200,000 yuan per month is common. We jointly appeal to the government to grant the same treatment as public schools. (Wang Bannong and others, teachers and staff of private schools in the southern part of the city) Editor's note: A similar letter from Li Weixi and others, teachers at private schools, will not be published again.</p>
<p>The Corrupt and Despicable Mentality Should Be Corrected</p>
<p>In today's society, everyone is no longer surprised by corruption and bribery, considering it an inevitable phenomenon at a certain stage. Unless such corrupt behavior directly or indirectly causes them loss, they are simply not interested. This has become a common practice over the years, numbing people's nerves.</p>
<p>For example, when someone is appointed to a tax-related position, their friends and relatives all congratulate them on getting a "lucrative post." They clearly know that a "lucrative post" means a position with abundant extra income. They also know that the actual salary of this position cannot be described as "lucrative." So, what are they referring to? Their minds are already filled with thoughts of corruption. Knowing it is corrupt, they still go to congratulate, which is truly a very painful thing. Not long ago, a foreigner came to our country to investigate politics and said after returning home that "corruption is prevalent in Chinese officialdom." However, he had not yet realized that the minds of the Chinese people had also been dyed black by the color of corruption.</p>
<p>With the exception of an absolute minority, the thoughts and actions of the general public have become distorted and unbearable, from neglecting their own responsibilities to engaging in profiteering and indulging in pleasure. Just take any public utility agency as an example. The people in charge should be extra diligent in their work because they are serving the public. However, the opposite is true; they are perfunctory and shirk their responsibilities. Perhaps it is because of the low salary that they are unwilling to work hard. However, is it right that the masses should suffer negative impacts because of the dissatisfaction of a few people with their positions? With such people, how can we hope for a good society? It is very difficult. General cynics often criticize the shortcomings of the government but ignore the potential of the people's distorted thoughts.</p>
<p>All wars in the world originate from "greed." Now, how can a country with a majority of people who are "greedy" and "do not think of the public" extinguish the flames of war and create a sound national organization? The people of the country pray for peace and happiness every day, but they are paying with checks for "corruption" and "irresponsibility." Such a transaction will not succeed. (Jin Jiaping)</p>
<p>The Muddy Luofu Road Awaits Repair</p>
<p>Editor: At the previous meeting of the City Council, a proposal was made to repair roads in various districts, including Tiantong Road and Shanxi Road, and the Bureau of Public Works was instructed to handle them according to their importance. Luofu Road in Hongkou was originally a cross street paved with long square stones. During the enemy puppet regime, the houses on the other side of the road collapsed, and it has since become a vacant ruin filled with garbage. Recently, many bungalows have been built. However, these bungalows do not have drainage ditches, so all the dirty water is poured onto the road, and over time, it has clogged the main drainage ditch, causing the water in the ditch to overflow onto the road, turning it into a mud pit that is difficult to walk on even on sunny days. We hope that the Bureau of Public Works will include this in the repair plan to benefit the people. (All residents of Luofu Road)</p>
<p>Consumer Cooperatives Need to Be Rectified</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper's Reader Opinions column that it encourages the widespread establishment of consumer cooperatives, which I greatly sympathize with. I learned that the authorities in District 19 (Yulin District) of this city initiated the organization of a consumer cooperative after the victory, and it has been established for nearly a year, but it has only distributed irrelevant daily necessities five or six times. When distributing, it does not notify all members, so many members miss out. It has now been silent for three months and exists in name only. At this time of transition between the old and new district chiefs in our district, please ask the new district chief to promptly take over the cooperative, rectify it, and earnestly handle the distribution of daily necessities so that members can enjoy real benefits. (A certain Jia Chief)</p>
<p>The Zhenbei Road Bridge Needs Urgent Repair</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Zhenbei Road is an important transportation route between Beixinjing and Zhenru. There are several bridges on this highway, commonly known as Bridge No. 2, Bridge No. 3, and Bridge No. 4. They are all made of wood. Since the enemy puppet regime until now, people have been crossing them with trepidation. One day, I was passing over Bridge No. 3 when, due to the dilapidated bridge surface being unevenly balanced, I unfortunately fell into the river. Therefore, fearing that others will repeat my experience, I specifically ask for a corner of your newspaper to appeal to the relevant authorities to urge urgent repairs to facilitate transportation. (Long Binyuan)</p>
<p>Answers to Questions Regarding Student Screening</p>
<p>Regarding the questions raised by Mr. Shen Yun'ou regarding student screening, here are the answers item by item: (1) Those who have not been screened cannot be changed to regular students, regardless of their entrance examination results. (2) The city will hold the third screening in the near future, but the date has not yet been decided. (3) The Ministry's order stipulates that high schools are not allowed to recruit transfer students in the second semester of the third year. If schools violate this order, the education administrative authorities will not issue graduation certificates. (4) The rumors are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Improved Sanitation in Jingyuan Village</p>
<p>Regarding the article "Jingyuan Village Needs to Improve Sanitation" submitted by reader Mr. Wang Junhao, after it was published, we received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau stating: "We ordered the 8th Squadron of the Cleaning Corps to investigate, and it was reported that there was no dumping of garbage cans in the alley. We searched everywhere for Mr. Wang Junhao but could not find him. We issued a certificate proving the sanitary condition of the alley, which has been improved." We hereby publish this.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Preface to Mr. Wu Tiecheng of Zhongshan on His Sixtieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Congratulated by Zhang Qun and 120 Others</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of the Lingnan region are magnificent, and the spirit of the people is vigorous. The gods have blessed this place, producing heroes in every generation. In the past, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, was destined to be a world-changing figure. Entrusted with a great mission and facing great difficulties, he used his God-given wisdom to advocate justice to the world, thereby laying the foundation for a republic and creating a democratic framework. His path is like the sun and moon traversing the sky, enduring for centuries without fading. Our President Chiang Kai-shek inherited his legacy, gathered great forces, and united the world against a common enemy, achieving final victory. His power awed enemy nations, and his military righteousness was valued by allied nations. He was able to rebuild China, restore the glory of Yu, and his great achievements shine throughout the world. Since the invention of writing, there has been no one to compare with him! From the era of reforming the old and ushering in the new to the autumn of resisting foreign aggression and defending the nation, the period was long and the encounters were difficult. However, those who shared the same heart to save the country and assisted His Excellency's virtues, whose merits are recorded on banners and whose names are passed down in history, are none other than Mr. Wu of Zhongshan! Mr. Wu, born of the illustrious Yanling clan and descended from the stars of Lingnan, dedicated himself to the Party and the nation, and his meritorious achievements are evident. Everyone looks up to him, and all follow his example. The higher his age, the greater his virtue; the more his reputation grows, the more humble his actions become. His benevolence extends far, so his blessings are lasting; his accomplishments are many, so his self-cultivation is great. Spreading benevolence will surely bring great fortune, and accomplishing things should lead to longevity. Great virtue is born daily, and only the benevolent live long. This is the eternal principle of Heaven and the supreme principle of human relations. Mr. Wu surpassed others in his youth and displayed his talent at an early age. He revealed his brilliance early on and harbored grand strategies. At that time, the Qing government was corrupt and foreign insults were increasing daily. He aspired to restore China and purify the world. Moreover, he was a descendant of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, of the same clan and of a family with a long history. He admired and respected Dr. Sun, and early on he followed the revolution, experiencing dangers and obstacles. His loyalty was as firm as gold and stone, and his spirit soared through the clouds. He challenged the sky, planting the first banner in Lingnan; the dragons fought in the wilderness, revealing his righteous duties in Xunyang; he and the late Chairman Lin advocated general elections, supported the Southern Capital, and represented the people of Jiangxi, sincerely expressing their loyalty. The Six Dynasties added to the splendor of the mountains and rivers, and the four seas comforted the hope of the clouds! This is the first reason why assisting Dr. Sun Yat-sen will surely bring him longevity. When Yuan Shikai stole the country, Heaven and man were furious. Mr. Wu went into exile overseas, calling on the people of the world to avenge the enemy and eliminate the wicked traitor. As for the troops who fought against the rebels in Yunnan and the efforts to protect the constitution in Guangdong, he either planned from afar or participated in person. Moreover, he understood military strategy and was well-versed in the art of war. He commanded troops with ease, and his escort had the merit of alerting the way. The city of Guangzhou was peaceful, and he achieved the merit of protecting the people. When the Northern Expedition began and the Central Plains were pacified, Youyan formed a confrontational situation, and the Northeast had a stronghold to rely on. Mr. Wu moved them with sincerity and enlightened them with righteousness, causing them to awaken and resolutely return. Thus began the movement to change the flag in the Northeast. Turning swords into jade and silk, a cup of wine was better than a million soldiers; transforming the atmosphere of war into brilliance, laughter laid the foundation for the situation in Kyushu! This is the second reason why promoting unification will surely bring him longevity. During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Wu was the mayor of Shanghai. He responded to the difficulties, forgetting sleep and food, and his efforts to mediate were effective, turning danger into safety. He then governed according to the times, treating everything as if it were spring, and his benevolence covered both Chinese and foreigners, and his reputation spread far and wide. He built sports fields, showing the path to healthy living; he focused on the central district, establishing a grand blueprint. In the past, we could imagine his towering wisdom, and today we see his great spirit. He was entrusted with an important mission in Lingnan, adding glory to his hometown; he issued proclamations in Guangdong, providing shelter to the people. At that time, smoke and dust filled the air, and beacon fires were frequent. Mr. Wu comforted the local people, encouraging the military and civilians to strengthen their determination to fight the enemy and to encourage each other with the spirit of being the source of the revolution. He still felt responsible for the hunger and drowning of others and cared for the sick. He added grace to those in need and warmed the wounded, spreading his virtue and promoting his benevolence! This is the third reason why spreading grace will surely bring him longevity. Our Chinese people are far from their homeland, pioneering distant lands. With simple tools, they have seen the difficult journey of entrepreneurship; braving the wind and rain, they have achieved admirable business performance. Because they lack the protection of their motherland, they have suffered foreign aggression. Our President expanded his benevolence like the sky, not abandoning distant lands. He sympathized with the love of his compatriots and understood the feelings of overseas Chinese in his heart. Therefore, Mr. Wu, with the heavy responsibility of Fan Han and as a founding member of the Party, was ordered to travel quickly. He conveyed condolences with eloquent words. Wherever he went, people bowed down and cheered, welcoming him with the ceremony of a state guest or respecting him with the etiquette of a prince. Mr. Wu traveled throughout Southeast Asia, diligently caring for overseas Chinese, encouraging them to abide by the law and respect etiquette, and urging neighboring countries to emphasize honesty and integrity. His words were strict and his righteousness was upright, and his reputation was established in foreign lands, and his sincerity was trusted in foreign lands. The overseas Chinese were inspired by this, strengthening their love for their motherland. Neighboring countries were inspired by this, strengthening their respect for the Chinese people. Bo Wang rode a raft, but he was inferior to this far-sighted strategy; Zheng He had a large fleet, but he did not have this far-reaching plan! This is the fourth reason why helping overseas Chinese will surely bring him longevity. The world situation is chaotic and ever-changing, and diplomatic responses are very different from usual. Mr. Wu has high ambitions and foresight, seeing the situation ahead. He examines the national situation internally and gathers opinions from all sides. He uses his wisdom to analyze the country like dissecting hairs; he uses his divine intuition to predict events like knowing the future, and he assumes the responsibilities of the border and advises the core. The grass and trees know his name, and the oceans also ask about his whereabouts. He treats distant lands with virtue and touches people deeply. Because his meritorious achievements are great, his admiration is even greater. He promotes friendly alliances and repairs good relations with neighboring countries, seeking friendship with countries during banquets and deepening friendship during observation meetings. His carriage is noisy in the streets, and his hat and robes are seen in public halls. He takes the perspective of an observer and achieves the effect of diligent work; he takes a side stance and obtains the effect of joyful unity. He is able to coordinate with national policies, win sympathy, join hands with the Allied forces to lead the way, and advance shoulder to shoulder with friendly nations! This is the fifth reason why assisting diplomacy will surely bring him longevity. Our Party leads the revolution with hardship and determination, using a spirit of perseverance to make unswerving efforts. It has created a brilliant history for the nation and a prosperous and happy future for the country. Mr. Wu has dedicated himself to the Party, becoming stronger in his old age. His personal life is entrusted to the life of the Party; his personal career is based on the career of the Party. When the country is in turmoil and public opinion is agitated, Mr. Wu is ordered to preside over Party affairs. He encourages comrades to protect the Party and to serve the country. He unites Party friendship, cultivates Party virtue, rectifies Party discipline, elucidates the Party program, and greatly displays the Party's achievements and promotes the Party's glory. In the future, he will further promote the Party, making it great and vigorous, standing side by side with Mount Tai and Mount Dai, and enduring with China! This is the sixth reason why dedicating himself to the Party will surely bring him longevity. However, the highest virtue is like a valley, and the great path is boundless. Like the rain nourishing all grains, it does not consider itself to be a blessing; like the spring breeze blowing on all things, it does not consider itself to be a merit. Mr. Wu presides over major plans, assisting in the revival of the country. Although the governance depends on yin and yang, his fear is deeper than frost and dew. He worries and works hard, following the sincerity of the Zhou dynasty's Ji Dan; he reflects on the difficulties, taking the warning of Wei Wu's restraint; he seeks talent like soup, spitting out food to invite guests; he accepts good advice like a stream, praising good words and monopolizing beauty. He is generous in his demeanor and tolerant, so he can encompass all directions and embrace the universe. All of these auspicious signs are signs of benevolence and longevity. Recently, internal strife has not ceased, and external criticism is ongoing, causing hardship for the people and difficulty in making progress. Mr. Wu is eager for unification, negotiating for peace, respecting the great righteousness of democracy, and guiding the grand regulations of constitutional consultation, establishing merit and virtue, leaving behind a righteous tomb for thousands of years; bringing longevity to the world and the people, creating boundless blessings for hundreds of millions. It is appropriate to list the Hongfan, preparing the auspiciousness of the ninety-fifth, shading the spiritual Toon tree, extending the years of eight thousand! Now, celebrating his sixtieth birthday, meeting a prosperous time, the Di Xiang Shrine competes to offer trees of longevity, and the Du Gong Birthday Hall praises the longevity cup! The groups are either comrades-in-arms or bound by affection, daily admiring the sun and moving forward to offer chapters of the Heaven-Protected; praising the winds of Tai and Lai, competing to imitate the blessings of the border people. We wish to celebrate every year, always celebrating birthdays with hundreds of flowers; and we also predict that he will be promoted every year, forever remaining in the long spring of March! Guo Ziyi assisted the Tang Dynasty, and all the officials imitated the call of Mount Song; Wen Yanbo assisted the Song Dynasty, and the nine prefectures offered songs of Mount Ganglu. This is the preface. Congratulated by Zhang Qun and 120 others. March, the thirtieth year of the Republic of China</p>

<h3>Bookstore Clerk</h3>
<p>— Ma Xiang</p>
<p>I've wanted to be a bookstore clerk for a long time. Long, long ago, I asked my teacher to try to find a way for me to work at major bookstores in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now, I unexpectedly became a clerk at a bookstore in this metropolis, a place where talent gathers. Sitting at the accounting desk in the bookstore, no customer would mistake me for anything other than a bookstore clerk, and one in charge of accounting at that.</p>
<p>Being a bookstore clerk is really great. Whoever walks into a bookstore is probably an intellectual (at least not illiterate). Since I like to chat, I've made quite a few friends. I've also learned about various people's criticisms and preferences for different books.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the boss gets a big batch of new books, sorting them is secondary. The first thing is to set the price. Seeing a good book with a cost price of 500 yuan, the boss knows that since it's "good," the price must be 2,000 yuan. If the boss is good, then we clerks are good too. If the price is too high and sales are slow, we can leisurely skim through it a couple of times.</p>
<p>After sorting and pricing, the next step is to read the books yourself! Which good book should my greedy eyes feast on first? At this moment, I'm reminded of seeing officials naked while eating in the bathhouse. Why don't they wear pants when eating? Oh! Now I understand: that's a kind of pride. If I weren't a bookstore clerk, how could I read so many new books one by one, according to my own preferences, without spending a dime? Movie theater employees watching movies, carpenter masters fixing short stools, it's all the same principle, right?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, sometimes because there are too many new books, it's too casual to just pick up one to read. As a result, there are books everywhere, east and west. I read "Best One-Act Plays" while lying down. I used Dr. Hu Shi's "History of Vernacular Literature" as a sleeping aid before bed. Although I know that Dr. Eddy's "Youth and Sexuality" is a good book, it's an academic paper, so it's too boring to read and I often have to cut it short. The two books I read earlier, "Wenxin" and Shen Congwen's "Xiangxing Sanji," were eclipsed by "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Dream of the Red Chamber," which I read to enrich my topics for chatting with customers. After finishing "Xiangxing Sanji," I wanted to read "Moonlight Sketches," but another clerk grabbed it halfway, so I had to pause for a moment. Someone said Zhang Tianyi's "Pursuit" is good, so I want to read it. "Midnight," which is next to "Pursuit" on the bookshelf, also seems to be beckoning to me. I want to read the three thick volumes of "Torrent." After reading Gorky's "Mother," I can't not read "People." I also need to read some plays. I've been reading "Song of Righteousness" for a long time, but "Snowy Night Return" is unfamiliar. Zang Kejia's poetry collection is also one of my favorites, and I'm determined to read it.</p>
<p>I'm now also in charge of handling money, so I should probably learn some accounting. Since the store has books on English and Russian, why should I give up without even flipping through them? I must, I must study them carefully. ... Wow! So many books, a thousand threads, where do I start?</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing is when a book that I decided to read but haven't gotten around to yet is bought by a customer. And there's only one copy in the store. One copy of "Principles of Accounting" was wrapped up and reluctantly handed to the customer under this kind of psychology.</p>
<p>I'm gradually becoming more like a clerk, more like a bookstore clerk. What I lack is the lying and exaggerating skills that merchants usually have. I'm still clumsy and slow in that regard.</p>
<p>Being a bookstore clerk is really great. One day, I was flipping through "The Good Earth," reading about Wang Lung entering the city and talking about his past and future with Lotus, when suddenly the boss patted me on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"Hey: A customer is here."</p>
<h3>Dove Bell</h3>
<p>— Xuan Yi</p>
<p>I yearn for that clear, melodious bell sound.</p>
<p>When the wind of late March brushes the green grass of the fields, when the wind of late March brushes the red flowers of the fields, when the sky of March floats with white clouds like light catkins, have you ever yearned for the blue sky, the flock of pigeons soaring across the sky, the clear bell sound left behind by the flock of pigeons?</p>
<p>A person who loves freedom, how much he yearns for this clear sound!</p>
<p>The dove bell is a long, lingering echo, it ripples in the waves of your heart, and then you will lean by the window and remember friends wandering on the horizon, childhood companions collecting cattle on the banks of their hometown river, and those long-ago, warm love affairs full of the feelings of May...</p>
<p>White pigeons soar in the boundless sky, living freely.</p>
<p>You, a person who loves freedom! How can you not yearn for that clear, melodious dove bell!</p>
<h3>Early Spring Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Spring has come. An unknown plant outside the window has bloomed with a few small yellow flowers.</p>
<p>I wanted to pick those little flowers several times. I wanted to put them in a green bottle. I wanted to place them on the table next to my desk. Then, in the morning, at quiet nights, in moments of loneliness, boredom, or pain, my soul could board those little flowers, like the children in "The Blue Bird" inserting thin, light feathers, able to fly out of the window at any time, fly to the distant horizon, to look for some strange, beautiful lost dreams. ...</p>
<p>But I didn't do that. I slammed the window shut and laughed, laughing at my own foolishness!</p>
<p>But I immediately stopped smiling. I looked at an unfinished manuscript on my desk and laughed, crying at my own uselessness and lack of talent!</p>
<p>I silently lay down on the bed, tilted my head, and quietly watched the tightly closed window frame. The window frame was covered with white paint, and there was a small hole in a peeling patch of white paint on the glass. I knew: as long as my eyes were close to the hole, I could still glimpse the beautiful blue sky outside, the white clouds under the blue sky, and the small birds leisurely flying from below. ...</p>
<p>I also know: when the morning sun rises, and the sky is filled with scarlet red light, the birds still sing, and the willow branches still sway. The red roses still emit a refreshing fragrance. The colorful wildflowers and green grass are still as vibrant and magnificent as before!</p>
<p>I also know: on a night of dense stars and shimmering light, the graceful white clouds drift with the wind. At that time, a crescent moon hangs diagonally in the middle of the sky, shooting down a piece of pure white light, like a silver gauze blanket, covering the earth. At that time, the grass rests, and the flowers sleep. The birds hide in their warm nests, making strange and mysterious songs in their dreams: "Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp..."</p>
<p>The spring garden! Inexhaustible scenery and poetic imagery! Why did I close the window of "tenderness" so early? Even the small "remembrance" hole, I let it coldly waste away?</p>
<p>Lying in bed, asking myself. Seemingly unable to answer. Getting up, sitting at the desk, holding a pen, thinking hard, I finally wrote these lines on paper: ——</p>
<p>I closed the window of tenderness early,</p>
<p>Because empty dreams only make me cry.</p>
<p>I would rather let the hole of memory coldly waste away,</p>
<p>Because there is greater work before me.</p>
<p>The times are iron-cast giants,</p>
<p>Carrying the train of life forward with full force!</p>
<p>Climbing the high mountain of career,</p>
<p>Turning my head back,</p>
<p>Tenderness and remembrance, ——</p>
<p>Two shooting stars flashing in the smoke and dust,</p>
<p>Gone in a moment!</p>

<h3>Friend of China, Historian René Grousset</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>In mid-January 1930, I had just finished my thesis at the University of Lyon in France when I received a telegram from Mr. René Grousset in Paris, inviting me to come to Paris for a visit. I had never met Mr. Grousset before; all I knew was that he was a scholar of Oriental languages. When I arrived in Paris and met him, I learned that he was born in 1885 in the beautiful city of Grenoble and was currently the Deputy Curator of the Musée Guimet. He was revising his "Histoire d'Extrême-Orient" (History of the Far East). On the other hand, Mr. Charles-Henry Hirsch, a novelist from "Mercure de France," the stronghold of the Symbolist movement, whom I had also never met, also invited me to Paris. Through Mr. Grousset's introduction, I met many Sinologists, such as Paul Pelliot, Henri Maspero, and Goulobev, etc. Through Mr. Hirsch's introduction, I entered "Mercure" and met many literary figures, such as André Gide and the Comtesse de Noailles, etc. For more than a decade, I have been turning around like an ant on a millstone, and I am ashamed of having achieved nothing, but the feeling of friendship cannot be forgotten!</p>
<p>Mr. Grousset is a historian of the Orient (Near East and Far East). His works are all major works. Before "Histoire d'Extrême-Orient," there was "Histoired'Asie" (History of Asia), which was his seminal work. After "Histoire d'Extrême-Orient," there was also "Reveild'Asie" (The Awakening of Asia), which expressed great sympathy for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the establishment of the Republic of China; "Sur les traces du Bouddha" (In the Footsteps of the Buddha), which mentioned the Tang Dynasty Buddhist Monk Xuanzang and other Chinese holy monks; "Civilisations d'Extrême-Orient" (Civilizations of the Far East), in which Chinese culture occupies a very important position; "Histoire des Croisades" (History of the Crusades), which paid special attention to the exchange of Eastern and Western cultures. In 1944, the Académie Française awarded Mr. Grousset the "Prix Louis Barthou." Louis Barthou was a historian and diplomat who had formed a cabinet, served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and was also a member of the Académie Française.</p>
<p>Mr. Grousset was promoted from Deputy Curator of the Musée Guimet to Curator of the Musée Cernuschi. At the end of 1945, the Académie Française elected him as a member: this is the highest honor a French writer can receive.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Chongqing will remember Vadime Elisseeff, the former cultural attaché of the French Embassy, who took a Chinese name: Ye Lifu, and his fiancée, Miss Francine Caullery. This young Sinologist (a student of Paul Pelliot) is Mr. Grousset's adopted son. In February 1946, Mr. Grousset retired and summoned Mr. Ye Lifu back to Paris to succeed him in his position.</p>
<p>It seems that few people in China know such a person who cherishes China: this is unfair! It is true that his research on Chinese culture is not meant to be known, but from our Chinese standpoint, we cannot help but be grateful to him: this is the reason why I wrote this introductory article. (Nanjing; March 4, 1947)</p>
<h3>Every Inch of Mountain and River, Every Drop of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 195</p>
<p>As she struck this pose, the two guards standing behind her also writhed like maggots, coordinating with her movements, as if cheering her on.</p>
<p>"Oh... I presume you are the commander of the Garrison Headquarters?" Tsurumi asked with a grin.</p>
<p>"Hmm...!" Her voice was short and abrupt, probably because she was so angry that she was about to explode.</p>
<p>"Then may I ask your honorable name?" Tsurumi asked, bowing.</p>
<p>"Commander Jin, haven't you heard of it?" – This was Kawashima Yoshiko's nickname. I was surprised.</p>
<p>"Oh, Commander Jin, Jin Bihui?" Tsurumi seemed to be appreciating her curves, looking her up and down, as if saying "seeing is not as good as hearing."</p>
<p>Wasn't Jin Bihui the Kawashima Yoshiko who sold everything? I was not lucky enough to meet this female rascal. When I heard Tsurumi mention her alias, I was shocked. Yaoqun next to me was probably also shocked, but then I heard her sneer, expressing contempt. Even Little Tiger was startled. But I was sure that he had never heard of this name, let alone knew what Kawashima Yoshiko was, so his surprise was probably influenced by me and Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"... Please report your name as well!" She was extremely impatient.</p>
<p>"I dare not, Tsurumi Tama, Chief Designer of the General Staff Headquarters."</p>
<p>"Oh... so it's Chief Tsurumi." She changed to Japanese, changed her tone, and changed her attitude. Most of it was surprise, a small part was relief. In the relief, there was also some suspicion. This mixed expression was completely revealed in her sinister and cunning eyes as they flickered.</p>
<p>Why the surprise? Probably because she had admired the name for a long time and finally met the person today. Why the relief? I can't say for sure, maybe it's like a hunter seeing a big worm he's tracking? Then why the suspicion? Perhaps Tsurumi's appearance seemed out of place, and his style was not enough. Maybe he was impersonating and using a false name.</p>
<p>"I dare not, I dare not!" Tsurumi only said these four words and then stopped abruptly. Although he was also speaking Japanese, the tone of the Japanese was even more unpleasant than the Korean-Shandong accent of our big guy "Zero Four."</p>
<p>Although the situation was quite tense, I couldn't help but laugh when I heard Tsurumi's prank. I knew very well that Tsurumi was deliberately teasing, probably preparing to joke with this female commander.</p>
<p>"What do you say, Mr. Yue?" Yaoqun asked me quietly. I was just about to tell Yaoqun what I guessed when I suddenly saw her eyes fixed, her expression stern, as if she had discovered an extremely terrifying scene. At the same time, her lips trembled, silently mumbling, her voice almost too faint to hear:</p>
<p>"Comrades... prepare to act...!!"</p>
<p>Hearing Yaoqun say this, I was shocked and doubtful. There were no alarm devices here; no red lights, and no hissing sounds. Looking at Yaoqun carefully again, I saw that her eyes were fixed, as if she had been hypnotized into the second stage of trance.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was not right, I was afraid that a master was secretly plotting against Yaoqun. I was about to use a strong "wake up" method to startle Yaoqun when I saw her pull Hu Cheng over with one hand, trembling her red lips, and continuing to mumble in an almost inaudible hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Comrades... prepare to act... all dispatched detachments have been ordered to return. The garrison is preparing to attack from the outside. Comrades inside, do not act upon hearing the signal... You must take advantage of the enemy's retreat and then flank them... Headquarters orders."</p>
<h3>Random Talk by a Lone Sojourner</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Some time ago, I watched a film – "Madame Curie." I was deeply moved because I liked the way it showed ordinariness within greatness, and greatness within ordinariness.</p>
<p>However, I strongly disagree with the conclusion drawn by "Madame Curie" in the film. She said: "Science is the only value of mankind."</p>
<p>"Is science the only value of mankind?"</p>
<p>"Can you imagine the consequences if the atomic bomb were in the hands of fascist tyrants?"</p>
<p>Naturally, if Madame Curie were not a scientist, but a poet or a writer, I would not have asked her the above questions.</p>
<p>"A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated."</p>
<p>"A hero can be hated, but not despised."</p>
<p>Respect always occupies the top position in all kinds of love. It suppresses human history.</p>
<p>"Life is dear, love is more precious; for the sake of freedom, both can be thrown away."</p>
<p>What is freedom? Freedom is the respect for human rights. It inserts two wings of thought and action, and it can fly freely whether in the sea of suffering or at the edge of hope.</p>
<p>The illusion of life is not the illusion of freedom; the death of love is not the death of freedom either.</p>
<p>Many people who are not contemporaneous are willing to destroy their lives and take love in exchange for a second of freedom in their bodies.</p>
<p>— Because that is the freedom of infinite time and space in the soul.</p>
<p>Great humanity lies in the ability to objectively criticize oneself, in the ability to admit one's own faults and weaknesses. Because being brave in correcting one's mistakes is not shameful, but glorious.</p>
<p>However, it is strange that, as a certain great European philosopher said, "Although there are many mirrors in the world, people often cannot know their own appearance." Many ugly women spend most of their time primping and preening in front of the mirror. If you witness this and laugh, the ugly woman will definitely think that you are praising her beauty, and even scold you sternly: "You scoundrel! What are you laughing at? You must have bad intentions." Because if there is no most violent fermentation, it is difficult to brew a view of one's own ugliness.</p>

<h3>Humor from the Central Savings Society and a Suggestion</h3>
<p>— Wu Daquan</p>
<p>The prize-linked savings managed by the Central Savings Society, which was quite famous before the war, now has the following prize distribution: one special prize, one first prize, one second prize, one third prize, and one fourth prize each with 416 winners, one consolation prize, and 83,349 last prizes. The prize money distribution is: a little more than 400,000 for the special prize, 2,000 yuan for the first prize, 300 yuan for the second prize, 200 yuan for the third prize, 100 yuan for the fourth prize, a little less than 2,000 yuan for the consolation prize, and 12 yuan for the last prize. The draw is held once a month. According to the above table, more than 11.5 million yuan should be awarded in prize money each month.</p>
<p>However, here's a "however." In the current situation, no one would be willing to go to the Central Savings Society to collect 12 yuan, which is not enough to buy half a sesame cake. The Central Savings Society can simply not pay out the prize money for these 83,349 last prizes, saving about 10 million yuan. 11.5 million yuan minus 10 million yuan, the Central Savings Society only needs to pay out 1.5 million yuan in prize money each month.</p>
<p>In reality, it's not even that much. The prize money for its second, third, and fourth prizes is only 300 yuan, 200 yuan, and 100 yuan. Taking these small amounts is not worth the round-trip fare. Who would be happy to go and get it? These three items amount to less than 250,000 yuan, so another 1.5 million yuan can be saved. Subtracting 250,000 yuan, the Central Savings Society only needs to pay out about 1.25 million yuan in prize money each month.</p>
<p>Currently, the Central Savings Society has a total of 833,499 depositors. Each depositor should deposit 12 yuan per month. Even today, the Central Savings Society has not asked to increase the amount. Depositors only need to pay the Central Savings Society 12 yuan each month. This benefit from the Central Savings Society to depositors should not be denied. However, no one in today's world does things that are detrimental to themselves. There is a small twist in how the Central Savings Society does things.</p>
<p>During the period of enemy occupation, the Central Savings Society was taken over by the puppet government. After the restoration, the Central Savings Society asked depositors to exchange their certificates. When exchanging certificates, it was stipulated that each depositor should pay the fees for twelve months, which should have been paid in installments over fifteen years, all at once. In other words, depositors lost the benefit of paying in installments. Relying on this gimmick, the Central Savings Society did not increase the monthly fee of 12 yuan, but benefited from collecting the fees all at once. Let's calculate it again for them:</p>
<p>Each depositor of the Central Savings Society should pay 12 yuan per month, 144 yuan per year, and 2,160 yuan in fifteen years. The Central Savings Society has a total of 833,499 depositors. Now, because they are paying all at once, 2,160 multiplied by 833,499, the Central Savings Society receives a total of over 1.8 billion yuan. At the current prevailing interest rate of 10% in Shanghai, the monthly interest income is over 100 million yuan. Compared with the monthly prize payment of 1.25 million yuan, the Central Savings Society's profit is unimaginable! If it included wealthy people, this could be tolerated, but unfortunately, those who are suffering from its exploitation are all our "common people."</p>
<p>Like my certificate, which is due in November 1960, the amount due is over 2,000 yuan. Judging from the current trend of currency inflation, I don't know if this 2,000 yuan will still be worth anything by 1960. All depositors' hopes are pinned on winning the lottery, but the Central Savings Society has four prize categories of 12 yuan, 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and 300 yuan, and the amount to be awarded accounts for more than 90% of the total amount. Isn't this deliberately making fun of the depositors? Unfortunately, we poor people really don't have such a "humorous mood."</p>
<p>I believe that the Central Savings Society can change the installment payment to a one-time payment due to changes in the situation, so why can't it adjust the prize amount and prize money? It would be better to reduce the number of prizes and increase the prize money. For example, the second, third, fourth, and last prizes can all be canceled and replaced with several prizes of 10,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan. If the Central Savings Society finds my suggestion to be agreeable, I will await instructions. Please don't be so "humorous" anymore.</p>
<h3>New Disease Name</h3>
<p>— Shijie</p>
<p>Family Doctor: "Mr. Boerfield, I congratulate you!"</p>
<p>Patient: "(Excited) Am I going to recover?"</p>
<p>Family Doctor: "No, I don't think so, because your disease is the first time I've seen it! After you die, we're thinking of naming the disease after you!"</p>
<h3>Crowded</h3>
<p>— Ziliu</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, people flocked to Shanghai. The population of Shanghai suddenly increased several times. Not only were the houses in every street and alley filled with people, but the pedestrians and vehicles on the roads were even more crowded. Everyone living in Shanghai sighed: "Shanghai is indeed too crowded!" Reading yesterday's newspaper, I learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau had specially hired three traffic management experts from the United States, Dr. Kangwei, Dr. Haar, and Dr. Likel, to come to Shanghai to find ways to improve Shanghai's traffic and make Shanghai's roads less crowded. This is undoubtedly good news. Once the traffic is improved, it will certainly not solve the housing problem, but it will be easier for us poor friends to squeeze onto trams and buses, and we will not have to walk across intersections with such a nervous mood. But I find it strange: why is Shanghai so crowded? Shanghai wasn't so crowded before the Anti-Japanese War? After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the sacrifice of so many people, why has Shanghai's population become even more crowded?</p>
<p>Last night at a friend's house, I heard a nanny from northern Jiangsu lament to my friend's wife: "It's really not easy to walk in Shanghai. If you're not careful, you'll be run over by a car. If my hometown were peaceful and had a good life, I really wouldn't want to live in this hellish place in Shanghai." These few plain words suddenly made me realize why Shanghai is so crowded. Naturally, because their hometowns don't have a good life, they come to Shanghai to make a living. I don't know how many people there are whose hometowns are plagued by war, some whose hometowns are plagued by natural disasters, and some whose hometowns are made difficult to live in by evil forces. In this way, everyone comes to Shanghai with a painful hope, hoping to find a place to eat in this bustling city. As a result, Shanghai's population suddenly increased, but Shanghai's area is only so much, so how can it not be crowded?</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that if the world is not peaceful and many people still cannot go home to live and work in peace, then even if American traffic experts come to Shanghai and use all their strength, I am afraid it will be difficult to solve the problem of Shanghai being too crowded.</p>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"Spring Dream in Paradise"</h3>
<p>— Wen Shu</p>
<p>I watched the preview of "Spring Dream in Paradise" and feel that I can recommend it to the audience.</p>
<p>This story depicts an honest engineer who, in this unreasonable society, cannot even secure a place to live despite working diligently, while other "parasites" enjoy the fruits of his labor. In fact, if the engineer could rely on the tricks of corruption and malfeasance, why would he have to sell his own flesh and blood to pay for his wife's delivery? He could still live in high-rise buildings and travel by car. This is reality. This is a world where good souls are thrown into hell to suffer, and evil people ascend to paradise to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>I admire the playwright's clear technique. At the beginning, he uses "still a power outage after the victory" to symbolize that it is still pitch black after the victory. In "Spring Dream," he gives workers low prices and reasonable compensation, creating a scene of peace and prosperity, in stark contrast to this chaotic reality. The excellent performance of the entire film is due to the director. His concise editing and thematic arrangement are ingenious everywhere. For example, using Shangguan Yunzhu's hand, from having no diamond ring to having a diamond ring, the two connected shots imply that a major event has been completed, and so on.</p>
<p>Lu Ming's portrayal of Mrs. Ding is natural and clear, gentle and quiet. The shortcoming is that she is not excited enough when she discovers her child, and there should be a complex process after the child is snatched away at the end.</p>
<p>Lan Ma's performance is quite successful, experienced and calm, but some of the characterizations are a bit overdone. Voice control still needs to be studied. There are several different timbres of voices appearing before and after. I don't know if it's a recording problem or his technical problem. Shi Yu is slightly weak, and some of the accusations in the scene are therefore weak. Wang Ping's costume is too puffy, especially in the summer and compared with the single clothes of the actors in the same scene, it is especially obvious. Her acting is seamless. Shangguan Yunzhu's role is inherently easy to please, so her performance is extremely vivid. Many other actors are also very good, achieving complete cooperation in an average and solid way.</p>
<p>Most of the actors come from the stage. In conclusion, they are all willing to act, but there are some common problems. Because they are accustomed to the methods of the stage, some of the delicate processes that should be there are omitted, and the movements in front of the camera are not integrated into the smooth rhythm. But they don't have the dead-eyed, water-gulping expressions of "old oil."</p>
<p>The photography and set design are both excellent choices. This is a work that surpasses previous films, so I boldly dare to recommend it to the audience.</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Circles</h3>
<p>The ninety-second issue of the "West Wind" monthly magazine edited by Huang Jiade and Huang Jiayin was published yesterday. The contents include Yang Hui's "Travels in the Eastern United States," Lin Taiyi's "Difficulty in Publishing Books" in the United States, Shen Yougan's "Little Westward Journey," Yu Wenyi's "Die-Hard Englishmen in Southeast Asia," Dai Wensai's "The Life of Xu Peide," Jing Ge's "Food, Clothing, Housing, and Transportation in New York," and Huang Jiade's translated "The Remaining Life of a Convict," and others.</p>
<p>The twenty-first issue of "Xinwen Tiandi" has been published. The number of pages in this issue has increased, and the content is even more substantial. The main items include "The Wishful Contention of the Diplomatic Lineup," "Long Yun Leaves Yunfu," "Hao Pengju's Defection Before and After," "Miracles in Many Plane Crashes," "Talking Outside the Plane Crash," "The Total Collapse of the Newspaper Industry," "The Gold Currency Storm," "Ma Hongda and Lei Qilin," "Shenyang in Winter," "Zhou Fohai Imprisoned on the Tiger Bridge," "British Wives Complain," "MacArthur Invites Chinese Reporters to Japan," "Opening Fire on the Central Propaganda Department," "Jiang Weiguo in Xuzhou," "News Mailbox," and other articles.</p>
<h3>Using Stories as Examples</h3>
<p>— Changliu</p>
<p>The Taiwan Incident is burning like wildfire these past two days. I believe the wise authorities will have appropriate measures to deal with it.</p>
<p>Let me tell a story here first: When a certain county in Xin reported an emergency in January 1945, a certain county known for its political integrity, a most capable county magistrate, when the Japanese invaders were closest to ××, a popular armed rebellion suddenly broke out, leaving the county magistrate alone.</p>
<p>Later, according to a local old jurist, this proved two points to reporters: First, it indicates that politics is divorced from the people, because the support or opposition of the people always has a day to erupt. Second, the political facilities of ××× are clear, but the cadres of ×××, such as the county magistrate of a certain county, forcibly enforce the administrative orders with high-pressure means. In peacetime, the people may dare to be angry but dare not speak, but the anger of the people cannot be hidden for long.</p>
<p>The gray-haired old jurist made a conclusion. He said: A politician should pay attention to two points in the current democratic surge: (1) explore the hidden suffering of the people, and (2) administrative orders should be from the bottom up, so that the common people have no hidden pain.</p>
<p>Taiwan is a province with an education level higher than any other place in the country. The expansion of this incident is by no means accidental. I hope that the authorities can follow the will of the people, seek out the hidden suffering of the people, and use gentle policies to quickly resolve this "wildfire" that is about to spread.</p>
<h3>The literary and art blockbuster "Beloved" starring Tao Le Shan Mai Gui will be shown in Jinmen soon.</h3>
<h3>Introducing "Rouge Tiger"</h3>
<p>— Wan Liu</p>
<p>The blockbuster "Rouge Tiger," which won the four-star award, is based on the novel written by the French novelist Prosper Mérimée, originally titled "Carmen," which depicts a tragic love story of a Gypsy woman. Later, it was adapted into an opera by a French musician, which was widely popular and popular in the world. Now it is brought to the screen from the opera, eliminating many of the limitations on the stage, making the performance more compact and complete, especially the actors in the series, such as Wei Wenluo Man's Carmen, whether in psychology or technology, are portrayed seamlessly. Lucien Corel's one-eyed fierceness is spicy, Malayhi's sentry also expresses the inner depression vividly, and Aitlin Yun's Murtie's guard captain all perform just right.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Having made up his mind, "Old Zhu" strode confidently into the reception room. "Your patience is truly remarkable!"</p>
<p>"You're not bad either! I've come seven times, and you've dodged me seven times. Couldn't hold out any longer, eh?" Zhu Zhaonian lazily rolled over on the sofa, stood up with a playful smile.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright!" A look of annoyance, hatred, and fear crept over Xu Shaoming's greasy face. "Old friend, just say it plainly, how much more money do you want me to donate?"</p>
<p>"Donate more? When have you ever donated?" Old Zhu said with his usual playful demeanor. Standing up, he was easily more than a foot taller than the short, plump Xu Shaoming.</p>
<p>"I lent you trucks for your parade, and even covered most of a tank of gas. Isn't that the same as donating money?" Xu Shaoming seemed a bit angry, as he sat down on another small sofa.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, Big Boss!" The other party just smiled. "With your status and wealth, aren't you ashamed to say that? Didn't you see in the newspaper: the day before yesterday, at our national flag donation parade, an old Cantonese vendor donated six thousand dollars all by himself, and a rickshaw puller donated three thousand. Old friend, your wealth is more than tens of thousands of times greater than theirs, isn't it? Just donating a few gallons of gas, does that sound reasonable? Now, we're about to send out this donation! Two million is still short by four to five hundred thousand. We're just asking you to make it complete!"</p>
<p>"Four to five hundred thousand? Old Zhu, you're deliberately trying to make things difficult for me, aren't you?" Xu Shaoming widened his eyes, sweat pouring from his head in anxiety.</p>
<p>Old Zhu burst into hearty laughter.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at? Just think, four to five hundred thousand, at a time when money is so tight, aren't you trying to force me to my death?" Xu Shaoming shouted like a machine gun, "Not to mention me, Xu Shaoming, throughout all of Guilin, how many people can come up with that amount right now? Old Zhu, we're old friends, old classmates, and you've helped me in the past. Now, if you yourself were trying to escape and needed to borrow this amount from me, I, as a brother for the sake of friendship, might still be able to scrape it together somehow and help you achieve your goal. But this kind of donating money to boost troop morale is really unnecessary! Why are you trying to pressure me like this?"</p>
<p>"Haha! People say I, Old Zhu, am optimistic, but I didn't expect you, Old Xu, to be even more optimistic! The battles in Hubei are so critical, the enemy's offensive is so fierce, and the National Army's supplies and treatment are so meager; and you still say donating money to boost troop morale is unnecessary. Then, I have to ask you: what is necessary?" Zhu Zhaonian's tone gradually hardened, but the smile on his face did not disappear.</p>
<p>"Transporting materials!" Xu Shaoming replied without thinking. "Right now, the most urgent thing is naturally transporting materials! For the sake of the country, for the sake of resistance, for the sake of..." (10)</p>
