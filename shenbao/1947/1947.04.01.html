<p>社論</p>
<h3>美金債券的發行</h3>
<p>三億元的美金庫券，與一億元的美金公債，將於今日起發行半數，其意義的重大，本報業於二十八日爲文指出，各方面的論列，亦甚詳盡。不過我們覺得，尚有兩點，還有加以闡揚的必要</p>
<p>其一·是關於債信的我國公債的信用，本無多大疑問。只因（一）抗戰以來，通貨日漸膨脹，幣值卽日漸低落。無論公債私債，債權人的暗虧太大，因此引不起一般投資人的興趣來。（二）原來各公債，仍照舊章還本付息。證券市塲上歷决所傳加若干倍還本的謠言，其結果終不脫爲謠言，故對於公債的投資，不免心存戒懼。（三）在抗戰時，黃金存款的四折獻金，尤於國信以甚大的打擊。勝利以後，游資異常充斥，同時財政又極度困難，狠有人主張應該發行公債，以資調劑。而政府始終鄭重其事，不肯輕於一試，就因爲這些綠故。</p>
<p>自從美金庫券與美金公債這件事決定以來，政府對於已往這些弱點的補救，可算已蓋了最大的努力。首先決定用美金爲標準，以加强民衆的信用。而還本付息時，對於庫券，雖仍付給國幣，却規定按照支付日中央銀行美金牌價折算，對於公債，且由國民政府特定，一律以美金外匯給付。這種措施，一般人對於幣值上的疑懼，自可一掃而空。而且（一）組織基金監理委員會，特許民衆團體代表參加，（二）指定担保，先期繳存，（三）再三聲明，尊重信用。財部俞部長在立法院中，且以財政部長的身份，保證將來基金監理委員會之組織，務求其公開及健全。此等辦法，其旨趣顯在恢復國信，鞏固債券本身應有之價值。而影饗所及，則不特此次美金債券，可望收到良好的結果，便是民衆對於國家的信用，也可望因此而提高起來。此種無形的收入，如果可以拿貨幣來計算，我們相信：也決計不在四億美元以下，這是值得鄭重一提的。</p>
<p>其二·是關於發行的當局對於上述債券的發行，已再三聲明，由民衆自由購認，決不採取攤銷的辦法。這一點，關係尤為重要。我國自有公債以來，事實上，恐怕還沒有和攤銷這兩個字絕過綠。無論是中央的，或是地方的，凡屬公債，多少總帶點掗銷或强募的性質。其以大義相責，使人不得不購認的，比較還算客氣，有時還要封產拘人，百方勒索，承應稍遲，便加上若干罪名的，也時有所聞。因爲這種手段，過於勉强，無形中，對於公債這兩個字，便深深地蒙上一套黑影，不易使人發生出良好的印象來，所以此次只用推銷的方式、，不取掗賈的手段，實做其勸募的功夫，而不用强迫的方法，只此一端，我們已認爲是財政上的絕大成功，初不必問發行的結果究竟如何了。</p>
<p>國家發行公債，在大多數的塲合，總不出於財政上的目的。換句話說，凡屬國民，有力出力，有錢出錢，在道義上，亦自有其應盡的責任。我們所以強調自由認購這一段話，其意義，當然在政府方面，只有如此做法，才是合理的與合法的途徑，也只有如此做法，才够得上民主政治的作風。所以在開始發行的今日，我們願再贅數語，預祝此次發行的成功，更望此種合理的與合法的途徑，再切實地展開到全部財政乃至全部政治上去。</p>
<h3>行憲大法的完在</h3>
<p>有關行憲之十大法規，經立法院近一週不分節日，不分假期，慎重討論後，已於卅日下午八時全部完成立法程序。此十種法規，其中四種係選舉罷免法，六種爲組織法。國大組織法首先於廿五日完成，國代選舉罷免法及總統，副總統選舉罷免法，則於廿八日通過，立委監委選舉罷免法暨五院組織法，亦於卅日全部完成立法程序。在此一短時期內而如期完成這有關行憲的十大法現的立法，我們對於立法院諸委員，在孫院長的主持之下忠誠謀國，勞瘁不辭，表示無限的敬意。此項有關行憲之十大法規，旣經制定，則此後關於行憲有準則可循，實爲我國的憲政之治開了一條大路。</p>
<p>綜觀此十大法規的制定，雖一秉瀋法的精神及我國旣定的國策，然其間亦有改變現行的制度者，社會部及糧食部之撤廢，及勞動水利等部之設置，卽爲一例。此外，關於職業團體及婦女名額之規定，亦爲各方所屬目。職業及婦女團體爲爭取名額，，旣曾多方呼籲，而立法院所通過之法案，對於是項呼籲却未予採納。就國家民族及民主憲政的常軌面論，立法院所通過的法案，於遵守旣定國策容許職業及婦女團體代表之規定而外，置其重心於全民，實在不失爲一種明智的舉措。在在立法院所通過的法案內，我們並不曾看見有職業及婦女團體代表的取消，祗是所定名額或未能滿足職業團體及婦女界的希望。這已經是一種折衷妥洽的結果。論理，如果我們參照英美民主政治的成例，則在我們的選舉法條文內，特爲職業團體及婦女以特定的名額，已是一種莫大的優惠。在我們的選舉法內，已兼採取了區域選舉及職業選舉這兩種制度；職業選舉的採取，原所以補區域選舉之不足。就理論上言，立法院此次所通過的選舉法案，似不能謂爲失策，應該得到人民一致擁謹的。</p>
<p>講到制度的改訂，糧食部原為一種戰時機構，如今予以撤廢，亦具有充分理由。社會部的職掌至不明晰，有的屬於內政部，有的屬於衛生部。關於人民團體之組織，原應歸內政部主管；至於訓練，那又是另一問題。如今立法院所通過的行政院組織法，將社會部予以裁撤，改設勞動部以注重農工福利，亦不失爲一種明智的舉措。我們感覺到遺憾的是邊政部的設置，二中全會旣有決議，在此次立法院會議席上亦有如此建議，但未能大多數的支持而遭否決。此外，監察司法考試等院的組織，亦復輒有修改；於迤守憲法精神之中，立憲政強固之基。此後，實施憲政，有軌道可資遵循，是則此次有關行憲之十大法規的完成立法，實爲我國法制史上空前的盛舉。</p>

<h3>開始檢討德國核心問題　外長會臨決定階段　史泰遜抵蘇京將晤史達林</h3>
<p>〔台衆社莫斯科卅一日電〕外長會議目前已涉及德國問題之中心問題，在今日之經濟問題辯論中，可能揭露會議之對德國問題是否得有基本之決定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科三十日電〕據接近四國外長會議之外國人士本日體稱：四國外長會議之成收，殆將決定於下一星期，良以四國外長在下星期內，將解決對德和約最重要之各點故也。美國方面之態度業見改變，惟馬歇爾國務卿急欲返國，誠爲各方所重視之問題，聞四國外長或將繼續會議五六星期之久。美國共和黨一九四八年總統候選人史泰遜業已行抵莫斯科，此行顯與四外長會議並無關係，但據此間美國人士稱史泰遜行抵此間之後，即立即要求與史達林元帥會晤，馬歇爾亦要求與史帥會晤亦未可必。</p>
<p>〔路透社英斯科三十日電〕觀察家相信在今後三四日內，莫斯科會議之成敗，即可獲有端倪。過去三星期中，會議工作以陳述各盟國關於德國經濟制度及其他各項問題之立塲爲主，自明日起，外長會將進入最重要之討論階段，研究下列三項被議定認爲最主要之問題：即（一）德國被視爲一個整個的經濟單位，並檢討德工業水準及賠償問題。（二）解除德國軍事動力。（三）德團臨時政府之形式及職權。今四强對於德國問題之大體意見已經明顯，今後即當提出解決辦法，以使各方意見得以協議。觀察家預料四强均有成竹在胸，但均不願事先透露而已。今各方面均承認若欲向盟管會頒佈工作訓令，必須先成立若干妥協，問題乃爲何時始能有妥，就何種事哥以成立妥協。德國經濟統一，一時似不能成爲事實，而關於提取工業產品作爲賠償之點，英美與法蘇意見亦殊懸殊。至於德國未來之憲法及解除德軍事動力，則似有妥協之望。觀察家復料關於召開德國和會及咨詢其他盟國意見之問題，似可在草斯科會議中成立協議。奧國條約得在莫斯科完成討諭之希望，又因請强關於奧境德資金定義之僵持而轉趨薄弱，預料蘇聯須於在德國之其他賠償方面得以滿足後，始能對奧境之德資金從事讓步。</p>
<h3>蒂托演說指責美國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒卅一日電〕蒂托總統今日向南斯拉夫國民議會發表演說，指實美國企圖支配整個南斯拉夫，美駐南大使柏德森應負美細南關係惡化之責任，希臘已成為帝國主義者威脅巴爾幹與全世界和平之基礎。蒂托並堅稱，奧地利之卡倫西亞省應割歸南國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅京卅日電〕南斯拉夫外長西米契自貝爾格勒啓程前往莫斯科，向四國外長會議陳述意見，道經此間，本日向羅報記者發表談話，對於南國參加一對德和會之重要性，以及美國拒不援助南國事均有所評論。據稱一，吾人前往斯莫斯科，並不擬提出任何新的建議，僅欲重申吾人在倫敦向四外决會議所提出之各項建議而已。吾人將堅持此種建議，良以對德和約對於吾人搆成重要之問題故也。</p>
<h3>德國工人三大願望</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林卅日電〕德國各業工會聯合大會昨在此間大劇塲舉行，到各界代表四百三十五人。首由大會主席宣稱，德國工人之主要目標不，有下列三項：（一）完成德國經濟及政治統一；（二）增加工業生產；（三）擬就進出口貿易計劃及幣制改革。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾觀賞蘇聯舞劇</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科卅一日專電〕美國務卿馬歇爾今晨往觀星烏舞，渠對主舞之多藝之青年舞孃普里塞茨卡亞，極爲讚美。馬氏係偕史密斯大使，福斯特，杜勒斯，墨飛及其他頗問數人前往觀舞。普氏表演完畢至前台時，侍者以綴有馬氏名刺之大花藍送至台前，以表其對靑春與才藝之讀美，而此妙齡之舞　亦向來賓包厢一再鞠躬答謝，並致送飛吻。</p>
<h3>蘇對各國記者嚴禁攝取照片</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林三十一日電〕蘇聯對攝影記者祗有一項主要反對，即爲渠等之攝影。記者在莫斯科勾留兩週以上之期間內，被蘇聯允許光顧四外長會議室，僅爲兩分鐘。吾人幾對於該城之一切，甚至吾人所住之旅館，皆不准攝影。吾人每次出外散步，皆有身材高大之秘密警察代表及着制服之警官尾隨於後。當記者在莫斯科市塲取出一攝影機時，警察一名即行奔來，搖其爾手，記者即遭逮捕。但一小時後終於被釋。</p>
<h3>捷國防部表示願對蘇效忠</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格卅一日電〕捷克國防部長史伏波達今日向煤礦工人發表演說，歡迎最近與渡關所簽訂之條約。略謂，此可視爲波蘭捷克與蘇聯所樹立之安全保護系統，以防止德國東侵，吾人今後將實行與各國合作之外交政策，以與愛好民主自由與他界和平之國，尤其是蘇聯互相攪携。吾國居於蘇德二國之間，故則應根據此一事實，以決定吾人整個外交政策。蘇聯保護吾國，幷保障吾人之自由與和平，吾人對此自當忠誠站於蘇聯一方。</p>
<h3>美援助希土計劃　重點乃在土耳共　美駐土大使向外委會報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅日電〕參院外交委員會上週討論援助希臘土耳其案秘密聽取意見後，藉悉採取制止地中海其產主義蔓延行動之關鍵乃在土耳其，而不在希臘。政府官員今日聲稱，一部份議員公開反對援助土耳其固在意料之中，但即在擁護總統計劃之人士間對土耳其方面顯仍缺乏熱誠。參院外委會秘密聽取意見時，係由駐土大使威爾遜出席陳述。其大部份經過情形照會異日可望公布。據某參議員告記者稱，威氏出席頗堪注目，結論曾謂總統提案根據於軍事方面考慮者多，而根據於政治方面考慮者少。威爾並稱，土耳其現爲地中海上抵抗蘇聯之最後一個强力政府。土耳其一旦動搖，伊朗，伊拉克，阿拉伯與其他各國勢將被迫屈伏於共產勢力之下，而將中中東開放，聽任蘇聯進入。目前土耳其雖具應付能力，但恐無法長期支持，大批常備軍不但涸竭其財政，抑日盡耗其人力。蘇聯駐軍土耳其邊境，雖未予以直接威脅，已一使土耳其必須保持大批軍隊云。</p>
<h3>美參議員魏萊建議　組歐洲民主聯邦　蘇聯等國應被賓擯門外</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅一日電〕參議員魏萊本日建議與聯合國組織歐洲民主聯邦，蘇聯及其「附庸國」均不在其內。據魏萊談稱，渠將向國會建議，要求國務院促成歐洲聯邦、保獲各該國政治·經濟·社會及宗敎之自由，免遭蘇聯及其附庸國之干涉。魏氏續稱，蘇聯等國應被擯門外，蓋難望彼等與民主國家共同合作。渠之建議乃依照杜魯門援助希土兩國之計劃云。</p>
<h3>戴高樂突破沉默　呼籲英法合作不滿法國憲法　賴瑪迪總理反唇相譏</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三十日電〕戴高榮將軍今日突破六個月來之沉默，在勒哈佛北十二哩處勃呂納伐爾海灘之一小山上，即一九四二年二月二十八日夜，英國及加處大之突擊隊，由法國地下運動人員供給情報，突擊破壤德國電台設備之處，向法國人民發表演說。戴氏謂分裂的意見，亦即衰敗的象徵，業已蓋沒國家的利益。　氏竭力呼籲法國之團結及英法之合作，渠切盼能有一日，使法國人民棄絕在黑暗中掙扎之生活。戴氏演說時在塲聽衆約一萬人，英大使特孚古柏，加拿大大使凡尼爾亦均在場，戴氏並親爲英加突擊隊紀念碑行奠基禮。戴氏演說畢，羣衆高呼「戴高樂秉政」不已。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎卅日電〕戴高樂將軍所發表之演說，幾完全從事於褒揚法國抵抗運動之工作，直至最後，始直接提及法國國內政治。當渠提及法國正在不健全之體制中徬徨時，顯係指憲法而言。就戴氏所見，法國之現行憲法決不能使法國復興。此亦即戴氏即使經政府當局建議亦不願在現行憲法下同意東山再起之謂。但戴氏現正靜候時機，則屬顯而易見。賴瑪迪總理已決定一俟獲悉戴氏演詞全文後，立即加以答覆，此點殊有重大竟義。賴瑪迪本日在加滕湮克城發表演說，力言共和國乃爲能使法國復興之唯一政體，强調法國力量之團結，係由一種共同觀觀念所鎔接而成，並非爲一人之暫時煊赫所結合。據政治觀察家稱：賴瑪迪與戴高樂演說之論據，完全對立。但此種對立將如何發展，其後果又若何，則須俟至戴高樂在斯特拉斯堡再度發表演說後，始可分曉云。</p>
<h3>美或將以朝鮮問題　交還四強協同處理</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕國務院官員頃宣稱：美國對朝鮮問題，與蘇聯覓取協議，失望之餘，或將決定將該一問題交還一九四五年十二月莫斯科簽訂關於朝鮮協定之四强，加以處理。據稱：韓南美佔領軍總司令霍奇上月在華府進行會商時、亦曾提出此項方針，幷謂；在朝鮮與蘇方覓取協議，徒勞無功，不如直接與蘇聯外畏莫洛托夫商談。據悉；美國對韓政策之王要方針，有如下述二端：（一）織續敦促蘇聯履行莫斯科協定；（二）在韓南進行經濟援助，增强民主政治，以逐步還政予朝鮮人民。</p>
<p>霍奇更調說國務院否認</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅一日電〕負資佔領區事宜之助理國務卿希爾特林中將本日談稱，據渠所知，某電台所謂聯合國軍事參謀委員會美代表黎其威中將將瓜代朝鮮美軍司令霍奇中將之說，完全不確。「余並未聞及此事。此事如果屬實，則余必有所知。」按無綫電評論員庇爾森曾稱，朝鮮境內困難日多，故將由黎其威中將瓜代霍奇中將，如此則麥帥如果返美，可由黎其威　任遺職云。同時國務院遠東司長范宣德亦謂，渠並未聞及此項計劃。另據消息靈通方面談稱，此間高級官員決意命霍奇返回朝鮮，以實施華府所擬定之援助韓南經濟及政治計劃。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京卅一日電〕據接近朝鮮美佔領軍司令霍奇將軍之消息靈通人土稱：美國在朝鮮問題上對蘇態度將趨强硬，甚且可能展開經濟性之攻勢。霍奇華府之行，負有改變美國對韓政策之責。美即將向蘇聯展開經濟性之攻勢。於未來三年之內，貸款六億美元與南韓，甚或要求蘇聯在美國貸款南韓之情況下，亦致力促成北韓之復興。</p>
<p>大量機關車分批運韓南</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城卅一日電〕美軍當局今日宣佈，美國政府貸款朝鮮已由英國輪船「裴恩」號運抵朝鮮。其中一輛且已經過安全試車與道路車二次，即將開始行駛，其餘二十九輛將在釜山附近試車。與「裴恩」號同時裝載車頭離德者尙有六船。</p>
<h3>手指移植　外科手術神技</h3>
<p>〔路透社伯明罕三十日電〕伯明罕一靑年工人右手四指被艱云後，由醫將其左手一指移　右手，右手竟又能有用。此項手術係伯明罕一外科醫師所施，堪稱神技。</p>
<h3>猶太恐怖份子猖獗海發油庫六處焚燬</h3>
<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷卅一日電〕英軍又在聖城大事搜捕破壤海發油管之「斯頓匪黨」恐怖份予。今日淸晨海發有六處油庫被毀焚燒，黑烟冲天，若干油庫附近之建築悉數被焚，損失達四百萬鎊。除軍警協助救火員全力撲救外，又有大批警衛隊出動戒嚴，以防再起意外，城內猶太區絕對禁止居民出入。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海發港卅一日電〕英軍今日押解違法猶太移民一批前往塞浦魯斯島時，此問港內發生爆炸，火光冲天，火勢燎及混合煉油廠及亮牌油公司設備附近，此輩蓮法移民共一千六百人，昨日乘走私船「莫勒特茲號」號企圖駛入巴勒斯坦，當被英國軍艦攔截。又昨日有英國警官被猶太恐佈份子伏兵擊斃。</p>
<h3>安理會繁忙</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖卅一日電〕聯合國機構已進入忙碌之一週，巴勒斯坦問題可望於本週正式提出，美國接管日本委任統治各島之計劃，亦將提付最後表決。關於後者，美方官員深信安理會週三會議，可付表決，實際上各國並直接反對美國計劃者，僅紐西蘭，蘇聯，英國之五張，尚成障礙，紐西蘭建議美國接管各島之協定，須待日本和的簽訂後，方能視爲最後協定，蘇聯建議安理會有權修改協定。英國要求聯合各國在此等島嶼上，均有平等經濟權利。</p>
<h3>印督蒙巴頓　約晤甘地真納</h3>
<p>孟買又起暴動事態嚴重</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里卅一日電〕甘地今日抵此，將晤印督蒙巴頓。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里卅一日電〕聖雄甘地今白抵此，準備小住數日之後，將恢復在皮哈爾省徒步旅行，意欲使當地印回敎徒言和。甘地每星期之沉默日本爲星期一，但因今日欲與新任印督蒙巴頓會晤，故改於星期日沉默。回盟主席眞納，可望於本星期到達新德里，亦將與向舊會晤。印度政界預料，此種會晤，不致有何新發展。</p>
<p>〔合衆社孟買卅日電〕此間印回敎民昨夜突然暴動，事態激烈，傳有四十人殞命，一百卅七人受傷。武裝軍隊開往彈壓，始予驅散，當見有四人被活活燒死。</p>

<h3>希內戰愈演愈烈　遊擊隊主力陷於重圍</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典卅日電〕此間自由黨報紙維瑪報頃載稱：希臘國軍刻正在伐杜辛山附近，與遊擊隊發生激戰，截至目前為止，希臘內戰實以此次戰後最為猛烈。兩日來游擊隊官兵陣亡一百〇三人，其中六人爲軍官，游擊隊之主力部隊已被包圍，食物飲水均發生匱乏，政府飛機並飛往襲擊，更使其狼狽不堪。在馬其頓之加尼察區，政府軍亦曾進攻安波利斯村之游擊隊，將其逐出該村。</p>

<h3>日本又一新政黨　民主黨成立</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京卅一日電〕日本新政黨「民生黨」本日已告成立，一擁有此屆國會中著名議員一四三人，較日本最大政黨自由黨之議員尚多二名。若干觀察家預料民主黨與社會民主黨在四月間之選舉中。對亞軍一席競爭必甚激烈，冠軍一席當顯屬諸自由黨無疑。按自由黨以從政歷史之悠久，諒可繼續博得大多數之議員席云。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京三十一日電〕日本議會昨夜在自由進步兩黨聯台壓力下，一百七十票對五十三票，擊破社會民主黨之反對，通過爭論已久之選舉法修正案。此通過之修正案規定在未來選舉中，用單記名投票及小選舉區制度，已使二保守性之黨派之力量大爲增强，並將造成兩黨對其反對派之決定性勝利。</p>

<h3>顧念前租界退職華員生計　決請政院撥款濟急　清理委會昨開預備會協議六點　發款日期留待中央批示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前公共租界法租界官有資產與義務債務淸理委員會，於昨日下午三時，在市府大禮堂　開預備會，出席谷春帆。祝平。胡文元、趙曾珏。唐性一。查良鑑·何德奎。及財政部張福運，外交部陳國廉等，由吳市長任主席。席間互相交換意見，迄五時三刻始散。會後，據吳市長語記者，問題甚爲複雜，尙無統盤具體之解決。委員會將於四月三日召開正式大會。為顧念各退　業員之生活起見，會中決議立即呈文行政院，請求先行撥款一部份救急，數目約爲一百數十億。關於償還之倍數問題，吳氏謂：以不超過現時之公務員薪工倍數爲原則。最後之決定，當在中央，因市府　錢以償也。</p>
<p>昨日會義中所討論者，大都皆係根據上次財政局前公共租界退職人員權益小組委員會之決議草案，該會經研討後獲致協議之各點如下：（一）關於下開四項：即儲蓄金·薪給儲蓄金·服務優良獎金·及退職金，應先作首次臨時付款。在一九四一年十二月三十一日或在此日以前退職人員之養老金，亦須立即繼續付給，其所有積欠並應照。（二）計算截止日期：上開前四項權益均予計算至一九四一年十二月底爲止，幷淸付之。（三）外幣：應付外幣或前工部局章程指明應照匯率折合外幣之國幣款數，均應以外幣付給之。（四）國幣：應付國幣之款須按照付款時市政府職員特邁之薪工倍數及其他加致數計算增發之。（五）上開各項應在可能之最短期內給付，不得無故遲延。（六）依照本協議上開前四項之付款，係賬上之首次臨時付款，並非對於應付各款總數之最後決定，其計算方式亦不得視爲確定不變。本協議並未解決利息問題，及因解雇而發生之補助金問題。本協議未確定一九四一年十二月三十一日以後職員即不得享受補償。</p>
<p>昨日下午二時，前工部局警務處華籍職員代表沈耀庭，吳旭成，郎海清，任之剛，陳廷舉，盧建東等赴市府聽取回音時，職員羣眾千餘人於蘇州路兒童花園集合後，集體湧至市府門前請願。市長聞訊，極爲震怒，論令立即散開，否則即不予辦理，並將呈報中央予以取消本案。請願羣衆乃即遵命四散歸去，留代表聽候消息。</p>
<p>吳市長於預備會議散後，即於會議室接見請願代表，吿以委員會已決定於日內即呈文行政院，請撥一百數十億以償。代表等追詢發款日期，吳市長答以無權決定，須待中央批示。市長並對不聽勸告一再聚衆請願事，表示大爲不滿，聲稱市府已竭盡其力。代表中當即有人申述，渠等係前工部局高級職員，亦顧體面，拋頭露面並非所願。衹因自勝利至今，猶無確切償還音訊，大部份職員爲牛活所困，故迫不及待，欲知確切發款日期云云。故市長對日期一點，拒絕作答，並即起座離去。</p>
<h3>正泰·生化·大中華　三廠購金案　不起訴處分　貸款有合法契約　不構成詐欺罪嫌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕正泰信記橡膠廠，中國生製藥廠，大中華造紙廠，利用生產貸款購囤黃金美鈔，擾亂金融詐欺嫌疑一案，茲經地檢處檢察官李名山偵查終結，認爲被吿正泰橡膠廠負責人洪福楣，生化藥廠負責人倪述祖，何儀朝，大中華紙廠負責人劉行蓀，戴煥堂，周樹華，王文德等七人，應予起訴處分。正泰等三廠於去年年終因資金週轉不靈，經呈准四聯總處生產貸款臨時審核委員會，均以成品原料估値七折作質，正泰貨得八億元，生化貸得五億元，大中華貸得五億元。合約內均載明該項貸款，指定專作採購原料，增加生產，不得移作別用。嗣大中華造紙廠於一月七日購進黃金七百五十兩，生化亦於同月二十日購進黃金三百七十兩，及美金票六千六百卅五元，正泰於廿一日，卅一日亦先後購得黃金五百餘兩，經四聯總處巡迴稽核團查悉，報由監察委員函知淞滬籌備司令部，依擾亂金融及欺詐手段取得貸款罪嫌，移送地檢處偵查。關於擾亂金融部份，檢察官以法律不溯旣往，係刑事立法之原則，被吿等購賣黃金均在本年一月卅一日以前，其時經濟緊急措施方案旣未頒佈，而該項黃金又係央行所配售，縱使被吿等行爲或有影響金融波動，但當時法律旣無處罰之明文，吾人在法言法，要難論以刑賣。關於詐欺部份，生產貸款係政府與商廠間之民事質權契的，政府貸予款項，商廠支付息金，幷有貨物作質，况訂約前曾經四聯總處詳細審核，是以被吿等取得貸款，殊無詐術之可言。且當時賣買金鈔旣屬合法，被吿等縱使以貸款購金得利，自亦非不法之取得，核與詐欺罪構成要件未符。被吿等又呈各該經營廠商帳目，證明生產貸款，確已悉數購買原料，而所以購進黃金美鈔者，實爲淸償債務。李檢察官根據上述事實理由，依刑事訴訟法第二百卅一條第十項予以不起訴處分。</p>

<h3>六種日用必需物品　三月份平均價差額　社會局昨公佈　實貼七萬三千元</h3>

<h3>中央銀行貼放委會　昨召開成立會議　張總裁希望建立一新金融體制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會，業於昨日下午四時，在該行三樓會議室，召開成立會議。到央行張總裁，劉副總裁，該會主委秦潤卿，副主委潘壽恒，伍克家，委員徐國懋，李道南，駱清華，居逸鴻，沈日新，陸書臣，王紫霜等。討論經過：（一）修正通過該會辦理上海商業行莊貼放通則。（二）提出工業貸款及出口物資貸款兩審查委員會名單，由央行聘任之。會議迄六時許始散。</p>
<p>按中央銀行之貼放業務，向係透過四聯總處，並對國家行局辦理。去年訂立重貼現轉質押辦法，商業行莊之向央行辦理重貼現轉質押轉押匯者，係按糾織銀團辦法，或僅限於指定辦理外匯之銀行。推行以來，曾收相當效果。最近張總裁到任後，爲進一步加强國行與商業行莊之聯擊合作，並充分供給生產資金，以期配合經濟緊急措施方案，及三中全會所通過之經濟改革方案起見，爰決定擴大貼放業務。除仍透過四聯總處，對國家行局辦理外，另於中央銀行內創設貼放委員會，辦理上海商業行莊申請重貼現轉質押曁轉押匯案件之審核事宜。</p>
<p>設兩貸款審核委會</p>
<p>昨日會議席上，張總裁曾宣讀貼放通則條文，並逐條說明，茲摘錄其說明之要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）新辦法設立貼放委員會，以中交及商業行莊代表，及準備庫交換所代表參加。並設工業貸款審核委員會，以工業界代表，及與工貸有經騐之銀行人士參加。又設出口物資貸款審核委員會，以出口業代表及與出口貸款有經騐之銀行人士參加，使中央銀行與國家行局，曁商業行莊，及使金融界與工商界，打成一片，成一有機體的金融商業組織。如身之使臂，臂之使指，彼此不特痛癢相關，而且互守紀律，共負經濟復興之使命。</p>
<p>（二）商業行莊或銀團提出之由請案件，先由委員會審核，提請中央銀行總裁副總裁批准後，交由業務局辦理重貼現轉質押或轉押匯。中央銀行辦此項貼放業務，決之於多數，所以期其公允合理。</p>
<p>（三）過去商業行莊向中央銀行辦理貼放，係按組織銀團辦法，而由銀團向中央銀行申請。新辦法則以行莊單獨向貼放委員會由請爲原則，僅經貼放委員會認爲有組成銀團辦理必要者，仍由銀團申請，以期各行莊得各自發揮其效能，而免因組織團體，致有牽掣遷延之弊。</p>
<p>（四）過去商業行莊，按組織銀團辦法，每家重貼現轉質押以二億元爲限，轉押匯以三億元爲限。新辦法規定每一行莊申請辦理重貼現轉質押轉押匯，其原放款總額，以不超過該行莊實收資本，及上月底止存款總額，（除去法定存款準備金總額）爲度，自較過去爲寬。尤其以行莊之存款總額爲標準，益可促進行莊致力於吸收存款。</p>
<p>（五）刻下工業界最感困難者，爲購得原料後，迄造成製品爲止之中間過程，無法取得資金之融通。出口商亦有同樣困吿，即自購得原料後，迄製爲成品可裝運出口爲止之中間過程，不易得到資金之融通。新辦法規定，工廠方面包裝戚運輸至目的地銷售，需要流動資金，出口商因收購出口物資整理提煉或運輸至口岸出口，需要營遝資金，均可供給。如是則健全之工廠及出口業，可不必虛耗精神時間於解決資金困難，而獲專心致力於增加生產與輸出。</p>
<p>新辦法中優點一斑</p>
<p>（六）新辦法規定，原放款每戶總額，以不超過：一·貼現五千萬元，二，質押五億元，三·押匯十億元爲限。原貸款申請人，在各銀團或各行莊請貸款項最多總額，每戶不超過該行莊存款百分之八。即一而放寬放款之限度，另一面則視每一行莊實力之大小，酌加限制。</p>
<p>（七）新辦法對原質押貸款之押品，以原料及在製品製成品等所値六折作押六成。其餘四成，得以辦妥公證手續之機器廠房四折作押。其機器廠房得　作押品之四成一點，係爲鼓勵商業行莊仿照國家行局，提倡以機器廠房作押，解決廠家困難之一部分。</p>
<p>（八）新辦法規定原貸款利率，不超過月息三分六釐，而中央銀行祇取一分八釐。意在使利率逐步降低，而使生產者及出口商擺脫高利貸之桎梏。</p>
<p>（九）新辦法規定，凡廠商對於增加產量，改良品質，减輕成本，確著成效者，得不受放款限額之限制，換言之，即可多予放款，俾健全進步之廠商，獲得切實之鼓勵。</p>
<p>張總裁結論謂：中央銀行能否達成其銀行之銀行之使命，國家行局及商業行莊能否達成其輔助國家，促進生產之使命，全視貼放政策之是否完善。切盼共同努力，建立一新金融體制。又今後中央銀行與商業行莊之關係，由過去之疏鬆狀態，而改臻於密切，奠定今後公私金融機構合作之基石。最後幷謂：此項貼放辦法，先試行於上海，當决第推廣於全國各大都市，以期廣收效果，而協助全國經濟之復興。</p>

<p>昨烟煤人心萎靡，散戶吐售仍多，並豐城塊（江西）鄱樂統（湖北）及陳山屑（江西）等客帮均有小額運到，是以市勢更趨疲軟。白煤塊上檔貨到貨極微，市價積堅，低檔貴寶慶塊汕頭塊等市勢虛軟，柴炭市况亦不景氣，柴炭行帮，對實銷雄厚之同業推銷，均以放根爲號召矣。</p>
<h3>明前新龍井溫州貨可先獻新</h3>
<p>查國人視爲珍品之明前新龍井，茲據同業談稱：運因天時日趨和暖，各產區均屆發育之期，且聞浙省溫州將於短時間內，首先蒞滬獻新，然預料售價受一切繳用浩大關係，恐未能低廉，至於各式內銷陳茶，本街及客帮之去化，依然寥寥，但執貨者　態，是以過程賡續支特茶市，一片賣聲，則愈趨强烈，良以本年度新茶，瞬將登塲，致持者對於陳茶，脫售之念，亟爲殷切也，惜進戶猶懷趦趄，是以市呈供多於求之狀，行情衰類無神，交易亦日處窮途。</p>
<h3>杉木洋松俱有到滬</h3>
<p>實銷不振市重趨軟</p>
<p>近日本材到源更充，杉木前到八百餘萬呎，今又到三四百萬呎，洋松到貨亦多，杭木以運輪綫轉緊，到貨較前減少，實銷不振，市况重趨軟弱，洋松每尺三千七百元，松板五分鋸方七萬五千元，杭木喊價每兩卅萬，聞杭市最高價爲十七八萬元，故價亦入疲途，杉木大條門售價每尺爲九百六十元，小條八百六十元。</p>
<h3>輸入臨時管理委會　調整內部機構</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入管理委員會，自四月一日起，已由執行委員會主任委員張嘉廠氏，正式改組如下：</p>

<p>湖州羊毛，昨市上吸胃賡續濃厚，價再上升，每司馬担爲十五萬元，山羊毛亦上漲至每担六萬元，山東羊毛，價仍站立原盤。</p>
<h3>派力斯貨缺價昂　天熱實銷已發動</h3>
<p>派力斯因天氣轉熟，實銷發動，客幫採辦遠較本街為殷，因客地派力斯西裝仍頗有風行，申地祇有品裝衣料銷路，市貨因產存缺乏，走銷一般，致成求過於供，價遂一律趨堅，昨頭號貸每碼批沽十六萬元，二號十四萬元，三號十二萬元，四號九萬五千元。</p>
<h3>榨油業望當局平價供給黃豆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據榨油業中人談：按目前黃豆每担市價九萬元計算，榨豆油每担浄成本，達四十萬元左右。目前豆油議價，每担爲廿五萬元，相去殊遠。然單憑訴整議價，亦不能根本解決問題。蓋每次議價調整不久，榨油原料又吿上漲。結果生產成本，又吿不敷。故澈底辦法，仍需請當局平價供給黃豆，俾維食油之生產。近日來各民營廠以黃豆短細，停榨豆油。惟棉子來源存底尙裕，故請油產量尙夫中輟。</p>
<h3>製藥業同業公會　聯名電主席致敬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近蔣主席垂察製藥工業，關係民族健康與國防前途，前日手諭主管當局，盡量扶植，便利復興。本市製藥工業同業公會八十三家會員工廠聞訊，咸表感奮，特聯名肅電致敬，同時並向衛生署當軸，表示謝意。</p>

<p>金菜產價連日報升，步緊五六萬元，此問號盤隨，漲昨行盤特別高貨呌五十餘萬元，普通亦需四十一二萬元。</p>
<h3>假期後交易不多華股市況平穩</h3>
<p>華股昨中途較爲堅俏，良以人心因美金公債採自由認購及紗價有提高之訊也。惟交易不多，經一部份存多了結後，最後又吿小挫。晨開時人心見好而昂，遞永紗一八六號九七號一五一號八九號四七號二二三號二一九號一七九號均進，現美亞二二三號首先掛停，永紗盤高至二四二〇元。九七號一〇六號二三五號二一八號三六號一九九號二二六號等賣出而告盤。榮豐由八三號掛漲停，無甚影響。後以一五二號三二號賣出，永紗曾迫低至二三三〇元，交易清稀，形勢平和，徘徊殊久。十一時一刻後，滬美亞由三〇號八九號等復掛漲停，八九號二二三號三六號一五六號四七號一〇六號一〇五號一八〇號紛紛買進，近午忽形補空，永紗扳高至二四七〇元以上，一七一號等趁高有供而稍盤，收後微挫，結果較封關前計永紗信和新光勤興新華各漲半成强，景福升半成弱，美亞漲停，信和亦漲一成。遞交計永紗華豐新光景福各升半成强，美亞漲停，信和亦好一成。冷股榮豐漲停，國貨水泥平平，餘微升迄漲半成强不等。午後</p>

<h3>浙贛鐵路復活了！</h3>
<p>— 三月廿六日杭州訊　本報駐杭記者黃行天</p>
<p>三月廿五日的早晨，當春陽剛普照到西子湖濱的時候，一個黑車頭拖着幾輛簡陋的客車和料車從城站華寳的站房前慢慢地向南駛去。這是勝利後浙贛路上第一列從杭州開往金華的火車，雖然那些到杭州來玩西湖的遊客們看也不要看它一眼，但無疑地它在東南經濟價値上正肩負着鉅大的責任。</p>
<p>路政特舉任重道遠</p>
<p>日軍未投降前，長達一百八十五公里的江邊至金華段，曾被日軍修復通車，且敷設重軌，以達其在軍事佔領上的要求。後來戰局演變，予敵日益不利。至卅四年夏，日軍開始拆毀路軌，機事，客車，貨車亦被逐漸運至京滬，津浦各綫；至勝利前夕，僅存杭州至諸曁一段，計長七十七公里，有機車三輛，客車九輛，貨車五十九輛，勝利後奉令接收，當時杭曁段係隸屬於「華中鐵路管理委員會」，在「管委會」下，成立「杭曁段總辦公處」，於十月一日點收。「管委會」旋於三月一日結束，改組成立京滬區鐵路管理局，「杭曁段辦公處」與南潯段同時奉令移交浙贛路接收。四月間，浙贛路局正式成立了。</p>
<p>杭曁段收後，因年久失修，行車速度甚緩，平均每小時不過二十公里，因材料供應問題，未能改善；其他各段復軌工作，更無從做起了。如諸曁至金華一〇八公里，敵人僅費廿天時間舖軌通車；而我們則因種種困難，竟無法施工。在勝利後的十二個月中，搶修工作進展甚微，江山至衢縣一段，總算於今年元旦通車了。</p>
<p>橋涵工程首先搶修</p>
<p>浙贛路搶修工作中最艱巨的是橋函工程，其次伯是鋼軌枕木和經費。一年餘來，多少工程都在等錢等料的窘狀下一再躭誤了日期；而人為的亦不無稍有關係。至於車輛的缺乏，爲數更大，據統計，現有機車僅十九輛，客車廿八輛，貨車二百五十一輛；預計分段通車，需機車八十八輛，客車一百卅一輛，貨車八百四十六輛；如全緣通車，則需機事一百四十輛，客車二百九十六輛，貨車一千二百五十輛。</p>
<p>浙贛鐵路修復的遲緩，影響整個東南地區的民生經濟至重且大，亟需全綫復軌。中央有鑒於斯，急謀趕修，遂於俗今年元旦，調侯家源氏接長路局。侯氏爲工程界前輩，戰前建築玉萍段時，主持得力，貢戲很大，今總攬浙贛路政，老馬議途，各方對他的期望自也極大。侯氏視事後，爲了趕修橋涵工程，特將全綫一百公尺以上的大橋分成三個橋工區。第一橋工區設金華，督修金華衡縣間的金華江，義山港，東蹟江等大橋；第二橋工區設梁家渡，督修上饒，南昌，間的上畹港，鄧家港，撫河支流等大橋；第一三橋工區設樟樹，督修南昌萍鄕一間的陝溪，山前，贛江支流，袁山等大橋，基礎工程，期於春汎前趕修完成。一面又成立渚衢，衢饒，饒向，南潯，南萍，萍株等六個工程處，負責修理復軌工程。同時行總浙江分署本年度的交通事業，亦以恢復浙贛鐵路爲一大工作項目；並爲求工作專責，手續簡化計，邀請交通部浙贛路局，省府等有關機關籌組專門委員會，負責材料之儲運及領配宜事。</p>
<p>各段工程進展緊急</p>
<p>在各段工程中，諸金段已首先完成了。該段全長一〇八公里，於二月一日開始日夜趕修，每日以二〇六至四公里的快速度釘道，收穫意外驚人的成果。在全體員工一致努力下，於三月十七日釘道究成，廿五日已全段通車，較預定通車日期提早一月有餘，實爲搶修浙贛路創一新紀錄。</p>
<p>至其他各段工程之進展如下：（一）金華至蘭谿廿三公里之路藝及橋樑已大致修理完竣，材料如能供應，本月底即可通車；（二）南潯段釘道工程，前阻於距九江廿公里之賽湖橋，現該橋工程即將修竣，交通部限四月底以前恢復通車；（三）上饒至南昌段橋樑現已動丁；（四）白塘至萍鄕間亦開始勘察；萍鄕至株州段已開始舖執，下月十日可望通車。祇要路局能持續修築諸金段的精神來幹下去，記者相信全綫通車，爲期亦不遠了。</p>
<p>今後計劃充實設備</p>
<p>浙贛路今後的計劃，路局為配合全國鐵路建設交通綱的發展，對於這唯一橫貫東南各省的交通要道，擬逐步加以復興，充實設備，而使能以嶄新的姿紫出現在軍南平原上。這是路局的希望，也是重南人民的希望。目前路局正在進行的計劃，最大者爲籌建蕭山機廠。爲了配合機務，加强運輸效率，並謀另星材料配件之自給自足起見，正在蕭山計劃建設一方圓五百畝，可容千餘工人的大機廠，現已擬具計劃預算，準備准後開始興建。至機廠機器設備，預算第一期經費六〇四，六二七，六〇美元，第二期一四八，七八九，二〇美元，第三期一〇九，八四〇，〇〇美元。機器總數量有一六五種，噸位達一二二〇三五噸，機廠小工具設備預算經費計四四〇一三〇八美元。全廠完成後的修理能力，每年可修理機車五四輛，客車三八〇輛，貨車一千輛，鑄件五百噸，豭件二百噸，其他標準配件及工具六〇噸，以便供給其他各廠段應用。至於戰時路局機廠內遷，由兵工署第三分廠偕去大小機器八十噸，現亦收回，由南平運枕，供蕭山現有臨時機商製造車輛發電等用途。</p>
<p>車輛嫌少請求增撥</p>
<p>目前杭曁段僅有三輛，代客車三輛；今杭金叚通車路綫展長達一倍以上，雖經招商承造客車六輛，奉准撥到貨車一部份，然仍不敷應付目前擁擠之客運貨運，故已電請交部增撥。至機車的缺乏，己向津浦路以每月六十萬元的代價租用車頭兩個，解決臨時需要、如全綫通車，所需車輛，自必更多。本年三月問？交通部雖曾召開全國各區鐵路局長會議，決定由隴海路撥機車五十六輛，貨車六百輛，但久未撥到，現因杭金，南潯，株萍三段通車將先後開始，所需迫切，已商由隴海路將是項車輛分兩期轉運：（一）經津浦，京滬綫至杭州，供杭金段使用；（二）經平漢綫至漢口裝船至九江，供南潯段使用；（三）經平漢，粵漢綫至株州，供株萍段使用。已請交部轉飭該路迅予撥交，並先由部撥聯總到滬貨車，計有四十噸低邊車十輸，二十噸高邊車四輛，已在杭曁段應用。</p>
<p>擴充業務保障安全</p>
<p>運輸業務方面，如計劃恢復各段客貨運列車，擬定杭金段每日往返五次，　　段往返三次，南　段往返四次，萍株段往返入决，並增設二等車，改善旅客列車設施，添置種種設備。復擬增撥貨車，恢復貨物負責運輸，以便利貨商，保障安全。對於運費之　付，代收貨價，車遞票據，及提單押匯等業務，亦擬逐項恢復。又爲設法招來大家貨運，另訂貨物特價，實行部定貨物分等表，以求其合理化。</p>
<p>鐵路運輸之發展，原謀沿綫實業之繁榮；而實業之繁榮，又賴運輸之便利。浙贛路沿綫所產紙，瓷器，茶葉，菸業，鹽、米，水果，牲畜，煤斤等物產，每年運往外埠，數量甚鉅，路局此後並擬與各地工商界保特密切聯繫，如對於出品包裝改良，製造技術之改進，出品銷路之推廣，各地商情之傳遞，及週轉金融等，從旁協助，供戲意見，以發展沿綫實業。並爲便利各地商旅，與交通部公路總局直轄各運輸處，以及京滬，滬杭甬，粵漢等鐵路舉辦客貨聯運。杭金段現已通車，由上海至江西間之聯運，已分別派員接洽進行中，一俟辦法決定，即可實現。</p>
<p>這樣，一方面實施現代化之鐵路管制，可與其他國家鐵路相媲美，一方面聯合南北鐵道，構成緊密的運輸綱，浙贛路的價値是重大的。在侯局長的新措施下，全棧通車，已指日可待，多少東南同胞將爲比而歡呼啊！</p>
<h3>台北事件雨過天青（續完）</h3>
<p>— 湃崖</p>
<p>此事政府旣完全接受市民之要求，本應可得和平之解決，但民衆仍毫無系統的提議，而政府也盡量採納，至二日上午陳長官復接見民意代表聽取意見，並再加決定四項辦法：（一）參加此項事件者不予追究，（二）被捕人民可由家長向憲兵團領回，（三）死傷者無分本省外省一律撫卹，（四）處理委員會增加各界人民代表，以容納大多數人民之意見，陳畏官復於二日下午三時向民衆廣播，鄭重宣佈上項四個辦法，但結果仍未得到收效，暴徒仍是一味橫行，變本加厲，處理委員會增加了各界人民代表，流氓藉以作大集團的機會，於是提議，越來越多，本來由於緝烟的局部小事，進而醞釀至政治方面的改革。</p>
<p>惟恐天下不亂</p>
<p>談到二二八事件處理委員會的組織，顧名思義，他的任務也只是負責協助政府來處理此次二，二八之緝私事件而已，但他們會裏的委員的目的並非如此，是藉此次之事件來要推翻長官公署改爲省政府，並要求應處長應任用本省人，司馬昭之心，路人共見，由於其動機不良，因此對殺人放火之流氓，和感情衝動缺乏理智隨聲附和之民衆，非特不加勸阻，使社會秩序早日恢復甚且佔據廣播電臺，公開煽動民衆反叛，惟恐天下不亂，以遂其混永棋魚目的。</p>
<p>野心家之鋒芒</p>
<p>會裏的委員除小部份是政府派去參加組織外，其餘大部份就是所謂人民代表了，他們這班所謂人民代表，泰半爲毫無國家觀念，不懂國家汰律，坐井觀天，盲從附和之輩，鎭日價盤據廣播電臺，妄自發表言論，鼓動風潮，非法組織，危詞惑衆，並譽專門殘殺手無寸鐵之外省人，而被擊斃之流氓爲革命先烈，眞滑天下之大稽，亦爲背叛國家顯然之跡象，但政府爲求和平之解決，不願有流血之現象發生，無不曉以大義，曲予接受，並嚴令警憲不得對暴動之民衆開槍，是以事變以後，盤憲被流氓繳去槍械及遭毆打傷亡者大不乏人。那知不獨不能體諒政府之苦衷，反益變本加厲，緝烟案原僅發生於臺北市一隅，而竟藉端通吿全省十七縣市成立二二八處理委員會，遍樹羽黨，遙相呼應，其用心可以想見。組織旣日漸龐大，叛亂之心亦日豪且決，要求更苛繁而無理，例如要求解除軍警武裝撤消警備總司令部，要求國軍繳械，都是叛國的意圖。並組織一個忠義服務隊其中份子多爲流氓，負責維持地方治安，同時大山學學生亦組織所謂自治靑年同盟，發表意見參加維持治安，到處侵佔機關，謂之接管，連十多歲之學生亦竟然參加行動，如此謊謬，實爲亙古所未有之奇聞。</p>
<p>其最先被接管者爲臺中市各機構，而全省唯一之發電廠，及鐵路委員會亦爲其佔據把持，臺中市所有外省籍公務人員均集中於前日軍之集中營，日給酸飯一碗，且肆意毆辱，美其名日保獲。臺北市之大明報，大登其詞，訊外省人集中後米價反跌，對此種無理性之行爲，竟大字標題，以翔得意，我們且冷靜一下頭腦想一想，臺中市之外省籍公務人員只數百人，在未被他們集中以節，所渭耗米量微之又　，何能造成米價上漲之主因，何况臺中爲臺灣最火之糧區呢，其實這次全國各地因受到京滬的經濟影響，物價無止境的上漲，蘇省爲防止此種現象，當局採取緊急處置，禁止黃金買賣及糧食登記，這一班大地主資本家眼看不能操縱來發發非法之財，心理早存不甘，是以藉口二二八緝煙事件，慫恿一班素被豢養之流氓，造出是非來搗亂，而奸黨亦乘此千載難逢之機會，參加煽惑離間，以致造此背叛國家行爲，言之寗不痛心！</p>
<p>自臺北二·二八·事件發生了後，一·二日間打風延至北達基隆南及高雄，全省每個角落皆掀起巨浪風潮，政府雖多方曲予優容，仍未能滿足他們的慾望，一時幾陷在無政府之狀態中，火車停駛，輪船停航，郵電不通，商店冷落，機關閉門等等，公私損失，人民之痛苦，何可勝計。</p>
<p>掛羊頭賣狗肉</p>
<p>他們這個處理委員會的組織，根本就是狐羣狗黨的大結合，名爲要求改革政治，但事實都是想爭取官位，要求縣市畏民選，高下級人員應全用本省人，如需用外省人者，應獲處理委員會之核准等，陳長官本以他們若有參加改革本省政治之誠意，允予將長官公署改爲省政府，各廳處長盡量任用本省人，並通知他們將名單提出，以便向中央推薦，各縣市推出縣市長候選人三名，以便圈定，但他們在此就發生了內訌，他們都想要爭取機會能將自己的名字列在名單上，可是官位是少，爭做官的人是多，僧旣多，粥又少，根本勢難分配，於是大家開始攻擊，打倒蔣渭川，呂伯雄等等的傳單，便在滿街上飛揚，而被打倒者以此次事件之造成，費了九牛二虎之力，何能被人打倒，於是各　　　相見，並各向長官公署條陳意見，冀圖登錄，對於眞正之政治改革興人民之痛苦及主要應該商談之緝烟案之善後，已拋之九霄雲外，他們究竟是愛國乎！叛國乎！於此顯然可見。</p>
<p>自始至終政府都極誠懇的接受民衆的要求，在合法範圍內無不採納，可是這班無理智的野心家，口是心非，一面仍唆使流氓到處搶掠倉庫，擊堅軍事機關，受奸徒煽惑之深，毫無覺悟，政府之寬大，竟認為是無能，其臺中臺南方面複將政府之武器解除，取而殘殺國內同胞，肆無忌憚，爲所欲爲！日本法西斯所遺下的劣根性，依然存在！</p>
<p>中央　蔣主席與陳長官以臺省離祖國五十餘年，備受日寇之蹂躪，抗戰勝利以後，歸還祖國，處處皆寬爲撫患，就此次事件之</p>
<p>發生　蔣主席在中櫃紀念週時明白昭示，陳長官亦先後向人民廣播過三次宣示政府態度，監察院復派閩臺監察使楊亮功氏來臺查辦，依此，如果確爲要求政治改革，應用合法合理之方式分向當局請求，政府無不接受。</p>
<p>被迫唱日本歌</p>
<p>詎知這一般野心家復於八日晚十一時教唆大批流氓向基隆要塞司令部及臺北警備總司令部襲擊，企圖攻佔，是夜之槍聲如聯珠鞭砲響，少有間斷，聞奸徒爲數甚衆冀望一鼓而下，是夜又在凄風苦雨之中，數日來已皆在生死不卜之間，乍聞猛烈槍聲，均爲之不然，面呈死色，亦可見是夜好徒襲擊之劇烈，其叛國之事實，更爲昭彰，長官公署曁警備總司令部以這班野心家如此頑固，已無改革政治之誠意，肆而行其叛亂之事實，爲維持地方秩序，保障善良起見，九日仍實施戒嚴。常打風飄至　中時，該處亦遍地都是流氓地痞，在野心家一聲號召之下，蜂湧而起，圍攻倉庫，繳去軍警武器，毆辱外省人員，各機關首長（外省人）與外省籍公敎人員皆被集中監視，失去自由，其中男女老幼皆有，迫令學唱日本國歌，但中有少製商人以錢賄賂，經認爲係「良民」，即發註有日文之「良搭民證」後釋放，似此豈非咄咄怪事！高雄港務局設計課長黃實因公火車南下至臺中亦被拘入所謂集中營後，乘機逃出，此爲黃氏親歷其境之事。</p>
<p>謝娥大義凜然</p>
<p>當全省各地在極度紊亂羣情瀏湧之中，臺省國大代表謝娥女士，爲勸阻他們勿越常軌，應以理智行事，不獨未能收效，反遭暴徒毆辱，並將其私人財產器物藥品（謝女士業醫院）搗毀一空。謝女士雖明知　心家與地痞流氓勾結之下，一發有不可收拾之勢，但爲激於國家民族之義憤，挺身出而阻止，不畏張暴，其精神勇氣，眞有愧爲　　男子者。反觀許多國大代表，參政員，省縣參議員，及自命爲社會賢達，地位聲望不亞於　女士者，爲數亦不少，總都是想在局勢混亂之中來混水摸魚，推波助滿，無所不掉其花搶，據佔電臺，大放厥詞，鼓動民衆，印發日文號外，煽惑民心，希冀能出爲領導人物，眞是「阿Q造反」，無復有加。</p>
<p>大員大軍到來</p>
<p>中央得到臺省騷動的報吿後，監察院即命閩臺監察使楊亮功氏來臺查辦並慰撫，楊監察使即在福州乘艦來臺，於八日抵達基隆，處理委員會藉詞歡迎，率領大批人員前往迎接，實存不良之心，當時楊監察使一行汽車數輛，前導者爲憲兵及隨員，他本人則在最後之一輛車中，車行中途竟被奸徒攔車龔擊，隨從人員有被榆傷，幸軍憲力加護衛，始得脫險，其居心之毒，圖刺大員，背叛國家，已無可韙言！</p>
<p>中央　據報告，以頭等襲擊軍事機關，企圖解除武裝，公然施行背叛國家行動，已非普通之合法政治要求，乃派陸軍廿一飾來　以資雜持治安，安定社會秩序，保護善良，於九日安全抵達基隆，同時登陸進駐臺北市，及先後向各縣市推進。</p>
<p>非法所組織的所謂二·二八事件處理會此時已人散樓空，自知行動　謬，必受國決制裁，均逃之夭夭，流氓星散，據佔各警察派出所之靑年學生，各機關之非法接管委員，亦皆逃走一空，冷淸淸，未見敢如數日前之耀武楊威。招搖過市，眞是邪不却正，一剎那：數日來瀰漫整個台灣之氣氛，逐漸烟消雲散，重見天日</p>
<p>自九日超，各縣市經國軍先後進駐後，對於非法團體，决第解散，剷除奸兇，慰撫善良，一切秩序即時恢復常態。所有各機關照常辦公。各工廠兩塲的烟筒亦都繼機冒烟了。臺中市被集中之外省籍公務人員也恢復自由。臺東縣各界電省挽留縣長謝眞繼任，臺中市各界電省署挽留市長黃克立，新竹市參議會電陳長官致敬，並派員來臺北迎縣長朱文伯返任，澎湖縣參議會亦電陳長官致敬並報吿該縣狀况。各縣市皆有秩序恢復之報吿，火車南北通行無阻，物價逐漸下跌，南來北去之輪船開始通航，一切皆復舊觀，但當局爲澈底肅淸奸徒起見，即將淸查戶口，以期保護善良民衆，十餘日來，全省六百餘萬人民，被陰霾罩下，幾透不出氣來，九日以後一切如舊了。秩序安全，街市熱鬧了。商店開門，行人擁擠，無不喜形於色。又逢此大好春光，上天放晴，桃李又再爭艷，各呈欣欣向榮之象。我們最後希望全臺的同胞，歷此次慘痛經騐之後，要澈底明瞭國家民族，切實與政府共同携手，把我們美麗的臺灣，建設成一個模範省！猛省吧！臺胞們！</p>

<h3>聚聚——揚州續夢之十三</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>筆者於「茶聚」一文中，曾道及過去揚州茶社中一些老茶客的情態。除了這一些茶客以外，當然還有很多雖非不計寒暑，亦不計晴雨的日必赴茶社，可是如有空閑，總樂於去消磨幾小時的人們。以揚州習俗說，發請帖，延嘉賓，假座酒樓，觥籌交錯，藉以聯歡話舊等等的並不怎麼喜愛，却特別喜愛邀人茶聚，遇到多時未見之親友，互道寒暄而後，固是互邀茶聚，難有例外，即便時時晤對，也會時時互邀茶聚。這在揚人說是「聚聚」，所謂「聚聚」，即是茶聚之意，「聚聚」的聲音，在過去揚州，各色交際的場合中乃至銜前巷口，是極易聽到的。</p>
<p>聚聚，在揚人可說是極喜愛的一種酬酢方式，也是極普遍的一種酬酢方式。多屬口約，罕寫便條，更不談備具正式請帖了。以手續論，旣很簡便，以費用論，也很儉省。並且這種聚聚，誰都沒存着禮尙往來的心，也沒將彼此作東道的次數多少時時盤算着，大槪因爲所費無多罷！</p>
<p>並且這聚聚，在過去也眞太使人樂意了。茶點謂人吃了，可以暫不付鈔，記在自家的帳上。如是要喝酒並須另貢酒肴之類，茶社代辦，也可暫不付鈔，一併記在賬上。又如來時還乘了人力車，車資若干，茶社亦可遵命代付，同樣的記在賬上。所以的人聚聚，可以身邊不帶一文。這是因爲誰喜愛到某茶社，誰便是某茶社的主顧。主顧有了賬，便更可招徠生意。過去物價波動很小，茶社主人自也不在於現金交易。何况現金交易，多是過路人，或是不常到茶社的，古老的揚州，早失却過去繁華，茶社生意，不靠這班主顧又如何能興隆呢？一切記賬，正是給予主顧的一種便利，記賬的茶客，也正是茶社主人衷心所歡迎的人，於是甲在某茶社賬册上開了戶頭，和乙聚聚，到了算賬時，茶房們可以仰體主人之意，絕對聽從甲的吩咐，將第幾册賬册取來，由甲親自記上那一天的欠款，乙即便取出鈔票，搶奪着要會東，乃至於詈罵着茶房要會東，終是無效的。即以筆者說，雖出生在揚州，可是在外的時候多，過去每遇休假回里，便因會東不易也多臨時在一兩處茶社裏開戶頭，這麼，彼此都可記賬，誰的眼尖手快，到帳册，誰便可作東道主人了。</p>
<p>此外，某茶社為某一類人所當聚之所。時常去，會見到許多臭味相投的友朋，這是必然的結果，因而久未回里的人回里後，總必依類到茶社裏走動走動，就在那裏可以會到自家心想遇到的人，便再不須逐一登門拜訪了。所以筆者過去上午回里時，下午必到茶社，下午回里時，翌晨必到茶社。在去時，茶房會吿訴筆者，某也在此，某也已去，也會代爲吿訴別人，說筆者已歸，筆者曾來。茶房肚裏有木賬，誰和誰是一羣，誰的行踪須得吿訴誰。這一去，比之登報啓事要切用得多了。並且友朋們旣　聚在那裏，和張談談，又和李談談，人多話多，左有逢源，這較逐一拜訪不將更「嚶求」之樂！</p>
<p>不過上午聚聚和下午聚聚意味却有些不同之處。上午的茶社，因爲往來人多，總不免嘈雜，下午即比較淸閑。因而上午側重在吃點心，下午却側重在喁喁閒話了。</p>
<h3>風高月黑夜</h3>
<p>— 王一德</p>
<p>尖風底下，月光如煙如紗，野地裏的蘆萊瑟瑟抖動。</p>
<p>朦朧的夜色中，掠過一陣哨唿，凄厲地劃破寂寞的長空；荆棘叢中幽黯處，　　　　躍一影條黑，混身玄色打扮。</p>
<p>他把臉孔朝向遠方，翹起嘴唇，以手指裝個圈兒門在嘴上；唏哩哩——嗚出一聲尖呌，立刻四野裘打起回音。</p>
<p>「喂！人手到齊沒有？」黑影尖起聲音向風中問話，隨着又抬手在眼沿上搭了凉棚，朝那暗處張望。</p>
<p>「都到齊啦，衹等你小毛哥的話哪！」前面傳來誰的回答，嗓音是沙啞的，簡直像那叫春的鴨子。</p>
<p>「夥計們曬！通個數兒，——」玄色打扮的黑影又朝前面作話。</p>
<p>「四個，四個人——張麻子，趙老大，小牛，劉　子。」對面風裏揚過來一串人的名字；聲音仍然是那個沙啞的。</p>
<p>「哦，齊啦！連咱小毛剛巧一共五側。——今兒咱們揀那橋西五家祖爺的那座，——那座新築的。夥計們有數沒有？」</p>
<p>五個人悄悄地在夜幕下移動，足步子很輕巧，不放出一點聲息。偶然有誰咳了一下，立刻驚破四周的幽靜。</p>
<p>尖風在高空襄掠過。</p>
<p>——「王公六泉先生之墓」——靑石的碑牌矗立在夜風裏，宛如打着瞌睡的巨人；比白天高大，比白天神秘。</p>
<p>五個人仰頭打量，以手掌摸過上面的字蹟。</p>
<p>「是了！拿火種來，」黑暗裏忽然有誰發話，旁邊的人就無聲受着他的使喚；這種塲合話兒少，說出來也容易發生效力。</p>
<p>「鷹嘴啄子，」又換了個沙嗓子向誰要着開土的用具，那旁邊的也依樣無聲遞給他。</p>
<p>火種亮一亮，啄子的嘴就插到泥裏；於是，墓的後面特特地起着沉悶的聲音，驟然人耳容易使人相信那是從地底下鐵上來的。</p>
<p>特特地響過一會，擦的一下，那是縫子剷着黃土。這一下似乎淸脆得很，尖風立即將它帶走。</p>
<p>良久，泥土給挖成巨大的洞穴，露出埋藏在裏面的石板。</p>
<p>「鐵尺，鐵尺拿來，！讓咱試試石板的份址」！</p>
<p>說話的人拿到鐵尺就把它插人，用力鬆動石板上的泥土。</p>
<p>笨重的石板動了，幾個人用刀扛掉它；累得滿身臭汗，但是放下去時卻是輕輕的，怕敲壞了誰的脚。</p>
<p>棺木嵌在石窖裏，呈現着光油油黑漆漆的頂蓋。</p>
<p>「開財箱了，夥計們站穩哪」！</p>
<p>人都以艾葉塞緊鼻孔，口裏漱過燒酒；搓搓自己的手，是驚惶也是興奮。</p>
<p>蓬！蓬！隨身携有斧子的那個，在砍棺木的蓋；每砍一下棺木屹然而發着空洞的鳴呌。</p>
<p>漸漸在它的邊沿上出現一條裂縫，不寬却很深。鐵尺的一路伸進去，一端就用人力壓，一端實行着槓桿作用。</p>
<p>「着力」！沙嗓子在叫，木材格格地響。</p>
<p>忽然，不讓人有時間提防似的，平地一聲雷聲；材蓋脫離棺木，不平衝地歪着，</p>
<p>有二個人走到兩頭，吃力地扛起把它放在一邊。</p>
<p>人的神情緊張，至此已達到極點！</p>
<p>「風燈」點着火，在材沿照了一下；拿塊雜布遮住死者的臉——習慣如此，剝尸衣的從來不讓自已看見死屍的臉；據說不這樣做曾經唬死過人。</p>
<p>「王爺在上且聽一言：小子等五個，爲貪窮所逼；上天無路，入地無門，挺而走險，又嫌力弱不够，千思萬計，只得開罪王爺，吿貸若干。明日當焚香稽首，知過謝恩……」玄色衣服的那個口裏喃喃，說究又跪下磕頭。但是等他站直身子，旁邊的人立刻圍攏來，眼睛像閃爍的燐火。</p>
<p>亂摸，亂摸！手濕渌渌地，空中散播敗肉的腐味。</p>
<p>剝下死人的衣服，色迹斑爛十分可怕。</p>
<p>摸過死人的週遭，找尋有沒有意外的油水。</p>
<p>「嗨！這是什麼意兒？」有誰找到一塊硬傢伙，份量重甸甸的却又不發亮。</p>
<p>「玉器！」玄色打扮的那個，冷峻地瞟過一眼就喊得出名目</p>
<p>手法熟練的，死屍從頭到脚全被摸過，凡是能够變錢的統統得拿走！</p>
<p>野風掠過，「風燈」冒了起</p>
<p>突然有誰報吿着時候！「北斗已斜，五更天近啦！」</p>
<p>「夥計們！算啦，留點給王爺自己吧！」誰又在這樣說。</p>
<p>一聲哨唿，「風燈」熄了，五個人影開始移動。留下墳墩裏的死尸瞪着眼睛遙遙望天。</p>
<p>「嘿嘿，又是滿載而歸！」沙嗓子像鴨呌。</p>
<p>尖風底下，月光如烟如紗，野地裏的蘆葦瑟瑟抖動。</p>
<h3>試驗</h3>
<p>— 陳因譚</p>
<p>你怎樣劃火柴？……你怎樣看你的手指甲？……呌你去望屋內一個角落時，你怎樣望法？……你怎樣去喝一杯水？</p>
<p>拿你自己和你的朋友來試騐一下看，這些可以試出你是男性還是女性。</p>
<p>女人劃火柴是向外面擦？男人是向着自己懷裏擦。</p>
<p>女人看手指甲的時候是望着整個的手；男人是屈起手指來只望着指甲。</p>
<p>女人去望屋內一個角落時，總是先把全屋子環視一下；男人是一直地向那角落望去。</p>
<p>女人喝水的時候總是從杯子上面望着對面的人；男人是向着杯子裏面望。</p>

<h3>獅子自殺與藝人生涯</h3>
<p>— 徐心芹</p>
<p>生不逢辰死也好笑</p>
<p>獅子自殺矣！</p>
<p>獅子於抗戰初起時，不死於上海實人院，不死於南京被誣入獄，章入黃秋岳漩渦，不死於湘北會戰懸岸墜馬，敵後突團，不死於桂林失守，金澄江大火中，不死於獨山道上捨身崖下，不死於渝昆飛機失事，又不死於東北前方酷寒觀戰，而默默地在回到上海之今日，竟以自殺開？</p>
<p>我何忍見活躍藝壇，飛騰戰塲，熱心事業之獅子，賣志以沒？然人證物證，莫不予我以鐵的事實。我於昨晚六時，邀獅子陪友人假文藝小憇聚餐，除我一人外，七時半而無人入座，紛電文潮，藝海，報社各地，均不知其蹤跡。而家中遺人送一字條來，促我速至×濟醫院三〇八號病床探望急救病人，並須代申請急救貸金，至今使我不信乃爲獅子，院中更不知其爲何許人？僅於衣袋中搜得我之名片與遺書，爲院長所識，乃電話吿我家中。眞耶？幻耶？</p>
<p>獅子固善飲，每飲必醉，然尙能騎自行車獨目返寓休息。今奈何棄車於白渡橋畔，縱身投水，衣履淋漓，幸而爲橋下積木所阻，電車爲之停止，賣票爲之呼救，船家紛擾，得而置之二白波碼頭，於是入×濟登袵席，然顧破血濺皮茄克，昏沈數小時猶未慶復生也。</p>
<p>其遺書寥寥不及百字，前一段云：「現代文化人無法生存，旣不敢挺而走險，又不甘中途變節，因而悲觀，消極自殺。………………」又有小詩云：</p>
<p>「林布蘭「書聖情痴」，</p>
<p>徐志摩「悄悄去了！」，</p>
<p>若渠的「月明也帶啼痕照，」</p>
<p>小鶼是「付與丹靑不忍描」，</p>

<p>熟情之獅子，不免如林布蘭憤世嫉俗，遂亦不免情痴，若渠小鶼，何獨不然？志摩則尤甚！惟遊戲人間，則又藝人所不免，不知者將目爲在捐，乃不得不有解嘲之可憐語也！</p>
<p>惜乎，獅子至今在彌留狀態下，不能一訴其隱衷於摯友，情勢危急，除電長沙茜妹外；余謹虔誠禱吿，希獅子得於急救後不死！然而，余所坐守之老友，面白如紙，呼吸微弱，余顫悚作記，不禁淚涔涔下矣！（一九四七，三，卅一夜十二時）</p>
<h3>靜物</h3>
<p>— 塞尙</p>
<p>塞尙Poul　Cezanne（1839-1906）不僅是後期印象派的一員大將，而是十九世紀所產生的最大的畫家，他沒有進過美術學校，也沒有拜過老師，祇憑自己埋頭研究而至于大成。可是他受到印象派的影響極大。所作不單注重光的分析，並凡對千物象的「質」與「量」有深刻的研究。現代成名的大畫家可說沒有一個不是直接問接的受他的影響的，因此他已成爲現代與近代畫壇的分水嶺，史家尊之爲「現代畫壇之父」。（獅子）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血300</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這個理由，很能說服了自己。可是還有一條更充分的理由；這，也許是以上各種理由中，比較可靠的解釋：譬如少年竟被自己捉住，或經自己一打招呼就站住了。然而他旣是有計劃這們來了，你質問他，他的答覆眞能呌你滿意嗎？換句話說，即使你把他送到軍部裏去，他就肯說眞話嗎？</p>
<p>鶴見天生有些拗執，年紀很輕，當然有一種莫明其妙的虛驕，這是常情；他當時沒有把這少年的動作，當他一回事，他認爲他有本領把這事弄得水落石出，並無需乎普通人對付事件，那種劇烈反應的動作。</p>
<p>然而這一「0915」究免怎麼解釋啊</p>
<p>這個號碼，呌他想遍了一切情報的密碼制度：舊式的，新式的，自己耗費許多心血創作的，竟想不出一些些關聯。這是個謎一樣的東西。號碼只有四個字，簡單得很，然而顚來倒去一想，腦筋裏簡直被這號碼充塞起來，每個小神經上都繫着一張字條，每張字條上，就有這麼一個簡單的「0915」。</p>
<p>敲門的聲音把他驚醒了。鶴見發覺自己昏睡過了；那張字條，本來拈在手上的，這時已經掉在地上了。翻轉手腕一瞧，已經十點二十幾分了。</p>
<p>「咦！」鶴見有些奇怪，奇怪萍子爲什麼不早來呌醒他。也許自己睡得太沉，萍子已經來過？</p>
<p>「請進來罷！」聲帶鬆了，有些沙啞；道是過分疲倦的表徵。</p>
<p>鵠見以爲萍子進來，必要笑他「到底男子不及女子的耐久性。」誰知房門開處，進來的不是萍子，乃是旅館裏那個下女。這個下女的印象，在乍一進入萬歲館之後，曾經在鶴見腦想中，有個很淡的奇特影子。沒有仔細分析，只覺得這下女有些奇特。先前要萍子讓這下女來呌醒他，也許就是有意要多看看她的行動。</p>
<p>「鶴見老爺！」下女行禮了，帶着處女的嬌羞。不大像一個老手；「有客來了，候得很久…」她手上還擎着一封公文似的信封，恭恭敬敬地遞了給鶴見。</p>
<p>「噢，」鶴見聽說有客，似乎奇怪，「萍子小姐呢？」</p>
<p>「小姐八點出外，直到現在……出去的時候，囑咐客人十點二十分再來，現在客人是二次再來，堅執要請見老爺…！」</p>
<p>鶴見看那公文信封上面印着「大日本駐滬領事總署」等等幾個字，收件人却是「中村萍子。」手指探摸了一下，覺出信封裏面似乎還有較小的信封。</p>
<p>「什麼樣的客人，。請進來罷…！」</p>
<p>「是一位少年軍人，他說是老爺的部下……」</p>
<p>「哦，知道了…快請他進來龍！」鶴見連連揮着手。</p>

<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>肺病患者，怕聽別人提到肺病。</p>
<p>老處女妒嫉活潑美麗的少女，惱悵「太太」「少奶奶」之類的稱號。自己沒有的幸運，往往希望別人也沒有。</p>
<p>對於痛古却又是很慷慨地願意佈施給別人，自己患了肺病，故意走近別人的嘴邊說話；故意濫用碗筷茶盃。</p>
<p>溺死鬼忘記了溺死的原因，也不　別人的痛苦，他只是天天在打算找「替身」。</p>
<p>孟軻說：「夫人必自侮，然後人侮之；家必自毀，而後人毀之；國必自伐，而後人伐之」。</p>
<p>又說：「桀紂之失天下也，失其民也」。我願意把這些老生常談鄭重地抄出來，懸諸廟堂，以爲百世股鑑。</p>
<p>朋友吿訴我，這個故事發生在安南。</p>
<p>一個中國人和另一個法國人，他們都操着法語，爲一件小事情爭執，最後彼此都出惡聲相罵。</p>
<p>那中國人氣極了，用道地中國家鄕話罵起來：「你媽的×，×你媽的×……</p>
<p>那法國人榮了半響，聽不懂對方的意思。經過了另一個中國人的迻譯，他才恍然大悟，不禁哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>「那是我母親的問題，你可以直接和她辦交涉。試徵求她的同意，這不是罵人的話……」。</p>
<p>這故事如果是眞的，倒很可以悟出中法兩國對於榮辱不同的看法。</p>
<p>在同一理性觀念下的人們，才有尊嚴可言。許多宗敎有他們各種不同的禮拜儀式。這些行為都不能細予思繹。</p>
<p>試將一國王，裸其全身，流放到一個荒島上。我想他底奠嚴感亦將與其衣褲同時卸去。</p>
<h3>日日都是萬愚節</h3>
<p>— 老農</p>
<p>任何一個民族，如果缺乏幽默感，不懂信用心，最好的辦法是不要談什麼萬愚節。這樣的民族，只好做老例：元宵玩燈，淸明踏靑，端午競渡，七夕乞巧，中秋賞月，重九登高，臘八熬粥，廿三送灶之類，保你安渡日子，不生意外。加插一個萬愚節，則萬萬不可，同時也不必！</p>
<p>何以故？</p>
<p>萬愚節，我首先得警吿你：是狡詐的日子，你看西洋人在這一天，任何人都可以開玩笑取樂，拿謠言惑衆，所以，隨你登報宣傳史達林病逝莫斯科也好，隨你逢人述說杜魯門在白宮中風也不妨，別人看了或者聽了，決不會說你造謠，也不致指爲顚在。要是在中國，你被扭入警局，法庭，或牢獄，都極有可能。爲避免麻煩計，還是請小心緘口，庶可安渡萬愚節！</p>
<p>老實說，萬愚節只適用於西洋，百分之百的不合於國情。空口仁義，空頭支票，在中國是視爲日常的事情，多此萬愚節一日，便無異於使造謠詐騙的機會加多一日了。換句話說，日日都是萬愚節，更有什麼特立一天爲萬愚節的必要呢？難道一定要使造謠狡詐哄騙等等合法化嗎？難道一面孔聖人君子，一肚子仁義道德，實際上一大批男盜女娼，謠言狡行，還嫌不够澈底嗎？</p>
<p>我並不反對萬愚節。萬愚節自有不可抹殺的一面，原來爲人在世，信用爲重，道義要緊，幽默也硬是要得，只許忠實，不許欺詐，那是當然的，可是終年的信用，整天的忠實，未免太嚴肅，也許還太膩頑，在三百六十五天之中，騰出廿四小時來，開開不傷脾氣的玩笑，造造無關宏旨的謠言，倒也很自由，無倫理之拘束，有新鮮的風趣，並且由此可以眞切地體騐到信用，道義，忠誠各種美德之足以珍視吧。</p>
<p>我的結論是：萬愚節在中國，最好能改名爲「萬信節」，倘有故違，「格殺不論」可也。</p>
<h3>愚人節</h3>
<p>— 而比</p>
<p>又是四月一日了。四月一日是「愚人節」，照例各國的報紙上會假造幾條聳人聽聞的消息，社交塲中更必然也散佈一些毫無根據的「束家長西家短」，務以引得人家將信將疑爲能事。等到事情鬧得成爲似局的時候，於是一言道破：「今天是四月一日是啊！」大家哈哈一笑了事。</p>
<p>也有人稱這一天爲「說誰節」。在這一天說誑，彷彿是誰都不必負什麼責任的。</p>
<p>但是，除掉這「說誑節」的一天之外，難道我們說的就都是眞話嗎？</p>
<p>大至國際間的折衝，小至朋友間的相處，試問誰還敢時時以眞誠相見，從不扯誑？凡是相信國際上還有所謂「道義」的人，這個人也就天眞得可以，——天眞得恐怕一世也不會看懂國際新聞了。</p>
<p>個人處呢？所謂在社會上「混」，所謂懂得「人情世故」，和「老實」這兩個字又相差何其太遠！試看三國演義罷，魯子敬是有「老實」之稱的，而此公就專門上當，專門挨罵！</p>
<p>所以，在四月一日上當的人，事實上是不會太多的。而要是還有人以爲衹有在四月一日才能說誑的話，那麼這位先生自己就未免還太天眞了一點——依我看來，就很有些「愚人」之嫌了！</p>
<h3>悲喜交加的新聞</h3>
<p>— 王樹昌</p>
<p>報載：「本市「聖約翰」，「之江」及「東吳」三大學，將合併爲聯合大學，校址設本市聖的翰內，惟鑒於校址不敷應用，·王樹昌·將該校校產「中山公園」收回自用。俾以改建校舍，三年內可完成。」</p>
<p>這一件設大不大說小不小的新聞，雖然不能够像金潮案，洋老虎等吸引人們的視綫，但是我亦得稍為注意一點才是。因為每個市民多少有一點關係，假若在敎育方面的立塲上說起來，收回產業，擴充校址，增添學額，是値得贊許的，徧是該校的產業是全滬市民的園地，在寸土如金的上海灘上，尤其使人感覺到公園越弄越少，所以吳市長爲此亦大傷腦筋地　　不決。</p>
<p>回憶在日兵佔領上海時，日方欲强據該校作爲兵營，後幾經交涉，始免蹂躪，亦幸矣。</p>

<h3>聽中國音樂作品後</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>三月三十日「蘭心」有一個中國作品演奏會，雖沒有滿座，可是聽的人不少，開頭是琵琶獨奏「覇王卸甲」接着是趙景深，李希同崑曲小宴，崑曲我似乎不感興趣，下面又是二胡獨奏「病中吟」，及另外一曲不知是否「空山鳥語」，連着是古琴獨奏「流水操」，那三種獨奏，雖然很有些技巧上的變化，但是在音樂上的價值就不大說得上來，而况樂器的音色欠佳，音量不够而有雜音，雖然用播音機來放大的那些樂器終究不是完美的。如果不能加以改良，那麼以後是要被淘汰的，或者祗有一部份要保存國粹的人所愛好。</p>
<p>在休息之後，都是獨唱，本來有鋼琴獨奏「牧童之笛」，（賀綠汀作對位法）因爲人不到，沒有表演。在獨唱方面，有黃自，趙元任，劉雪厂與陳田鶴等的作品，其中趙元任的「賣布謠」，（劉大白作詞）頗可作為學校的唱歌材料。黃自的「農家樂」，「踏雪尋梅」兩曲，也還不錯。據我的意見，作曲家應有國際的觀念，不必國家意識太重，什麼一定要中國風味，東方色彩。凡是上品的曲子，決不是用德國派，俄國派可以區別的。音樂家的作品，不是用來代表一國的；是代表所有一切有生命乃至無生命的。大家表同情的，那纔是眞正的音樂。中國的音樂，剛在下種子，我希望產生那全世界人民所需要的精神食糧，因爲我們中國人是富有感情的民族。我聽了這一决中國音樂作品演奏會後唯一的希望。</p>
<h3>辜鴻銘軼事</h3>
<p>— 丈夫</p>
<p>安福部當權時，頒布了一個新的國會選舉法，其中有一部份的參議員須由中央通需院票選的，凡國立大學敎授，或在國外大學得學位的，都有選舉票。於是許多留學生有學士碩士的，都有人來兜賣；本人不必到塲，自有人拿文憑去登記投票，據說常時的市價，是每張文憑可以暫時賣二百元。而且祗要現一現資格就行了。（當時的二百元，最少可抵今日之四百萬元。）</p>
<p>辜鴻銘老先生那裏，居然有一位小政客，要運動他起來了。請辜老投他一票，辜說：「我的文憑早就丟了」。那位小政客說：「誰認不得你老人家，只要你親自來投票，用不着文憑」。</p>
<p>辜在晚年，早已看破世間一切，游戲三味，便向那位政客說：「人家賣兩百元一票，我老辜至少要賣五百塊」。</p>
<p>那政客說：「別人兩百，你老人家三百」。辜一定不肯，至少要賣四百元一票，那政客也就答應了。</p>
<p>選舉的前一天，那位小政客果然把四百元鈔票和選舉入塲證都帶到辜府，再三可囑辜老第二天務必到塲，等那人一走，辜便立即出門，從北京趕常天下午的快車到了天津，把四百元全部化在天津紅倌人呌做一枝花的身上。兩天工夫，錢花光了，他就回家。</p>
<p>那位小政客聽說辜回來了，趕到辜家大罵事無信義，事拿起一根棍子，指着那小政客說：「你瞎了限，敢拿錢來買我！你也配講信義！你給我滾出去，從今以後，不准再上我門來」！</p>
<p>那政客看見辜老的棍子，便嚇得乖乘的逃出去了。四百元也就是今日的八百萬，白白的讓　鴻銘花費在一枝花的身上。</p>
<h3>最快的沖晒</h3>
<p>— 陸淸</p>
<p>一幀照片從拍攝到冲　完成，頂快需要多少時間？</p>
<p>上海有幾家照相館的「特快照相」，能够在一小時內交件。報館裏的新聞照片冲晒得更快，祗要幾分鐘。而最近發明的一種特快照相術，從拍攝到冲晒完成，全部時間是十五秒鐘！</p>
<p>這種特伙照相是美國柯達公司的新發明，亦是一件軍事秘密，全套器械有一具特製的照相機，一套冲洗器械，和一具放映機，拍攝時用特製的閃光燈，以萬份之一秒的速率曝光；再田特製的强力藥液，在華氏一百四十度的高溫度下，以九秒鐘的時間完成冲洗工作（按普通底片冲晒時溫度不能超過華氏九十度）；最後照片用熱空氣吹乾，用放映器將放大的影像，映射於銀幕上。全部工作，可以在十五秒鐘內完成。這種新發明在去年十月十五曾公開表演一次。那時一羣被招待的主筆和記者步入餐廳時被攝的照片，在各人還禾走到座位前，影像己清晰地放映在銀幕上了</p>
<p>這種新發明無疑的會引起各界的注意的，特別是攝影記者們</p>

<p>可是蘭沒有來得及睬她。在洞外一片皎潔的月光下，她已發現左邊那條小路上，有一條熟見的瘦長的身影，正像衝鋒似的向她跟前跑過來；這人影顯得特別的長，再最近一些，妙已經可以看見老祝的肩上正馱着矮而胖的緋緋。</p>
<p>「媽！弟弟！媽！弟弟」！緋緋在老遠已經狂喊起來了。</p>
<p>小榮一下下洒脫了小沈的手，像滾一樣的奔上去。</p>
<p>「姐姐！兔子爸爸呢？兔子爸爸呢」？</p>
<p>問也不自覺地開始了瘋在似的奔跑。</p>
<p>「緋緋！緋緋」！她不顧一切的喊，熱淚打眼角上斷綫似的淌下來。</p>
<p>「5111，5271，5144，321712……」老祝的口哨吹得又響又熟，像一側軍人在唱凱旋歌似的。</p>

<p>住在東江一所小學校樓上的祝兆年在淸早六點鐘模樣便被摘外小巷裏的紛擾　所驚醒了，他懶懶地在竹　上翻了一個者，伸了伸兩條長腿，正打算再假寐一會，可是隔牆的聲音愈來愈大了，無論怎樣使他不能再靜心安臥。</p>
<p>「他媽的！又是什麼玩意兒？」他一骨碌坐了起來，心裏在這樣咀咒。（三一）</p>
<h3>吃老虎肉</h3>
<p>— 心水</p>
<p>南京有一家報紙上說：「上海來客談，滬中正路有人捆設老虎肉攤，以活虎一頭置籠中展覽，以死虎二頭零碎斬售，每兩二萬元，每斤三十二萬元，顧客爭購，二頭大虎一天半賣光，廚師多無烹飪經騐，大傷腦筋。」</p>
<p>我起初讀了這則新聞，疑惑這所謂虎，就是前幾天喧稱一時的「打老虎」的結果，大家在「寢其皮而食其肉」了。後來又想起所謂金老虎其實並沒有打得着，只成了「三人市虎」的謠言，這才覺悟到自己是錯定了的。如今吃的是道地的獵戶打來的老虎，是山陬小邑進貢上來的。山鄕人知道上海人的膽子素來小，又柔弱無力，據說吃了老虎肉，一可以壯膽子，二可以長力氣，希望膽壯力壯之後，眞的打倒橫行覇道的老虎，像周處射殺山中弔晴白額的大蟲一般。那才是人民的幸事。</p>
<p>有人說：「虎頭燕頷，飛而食肉，此萬里侯相也。」老虎肉，還只有讓封侯的人吃，平民是並沒有這種吃福的。不信，只要看上海的「一般廚師多無烹飪經騐，大傷腦筋，」就可以徽實我的話了。</p>
<p>至於打老虎云云，早已成「虎頭蛇尾」，一般老百姓只好是「心之憂危，若蹈虎尾」，在暗中呌呌危險而已，怎樣談得到普遍的吃老虎肉呢？</p>
<h3>喝火令</h3>

<h3>Jinpu Front Recovers Tai'an; National Army Units in Changqing and Feicheng Join Forces; Northern Henan Tense as Communist Forces Vigorously Attack Xinxiang</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 31st] The National Army on the Jinpu front recovered Tai'an at 5:00 PM on the 31st. Additionally, the National Army moving south from Changqing joined forces with the Feicheng National Army at noon on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 31st] The elite troops of Wang Yaowu's forces, moving east from the Feicheng area of the western Shandong corridor, had by the afternoon of the 30th occupied Qinglong Mountain and Taipingdian, located just over ten *li* northwest of Tai'an City, sufficient to control the city. Simultaneously, the National Army advancing north from Dawenkou also occupied Caozhuang, twelve kilometers south of the city from Nanliu Manzhuang. Starting on the morning of the 31st, they launched an offensive against the urban area from the southwest and south. The original Communist forces in the urban area, numbering only two brigades, were in a state of disarray after the fierce National Army attacks. Based on the progress, the recovery of the city walls within days is beyond doubt. After the recovery of Jieshou, a key point at the western foot of Mount Tai among the continuous mountains, the Jinpu Railway's Xuzhou-Jinan section will be smoothly connected.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 31st] The recovery of Tai'an is imminent. On the evening of the 30th, the National Army occupied Qinglong Mountain, over ten *hua li* west of Tai'an City. The railway front also reached a point ten kilometers north of Dawenkou. On the 31st, they reduced the encirclement and rapidly advanced towards Tai'an. According to aerial reconnaissance, no people were seen inside Tai'an City, and large Communist forces had begun to retreat in recent days.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 31st] On the morning of the 31st, Wang Yaowu's forces routed the Communist forces at Taipingdian, twelve kilometers northwest of Tai'an, and reached the outskirts of Tai'an City. They joined forces with the National Army, which had reached the southern suburbs of the city, and began a fierce attack on Tai'an City. The Communist forces dispatched 20,000 troops from Jiawu to reinforce Tai'an, but the National Army will soon capture Tai'an.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 31st] The situation in northern Henan is tense. Over 60,000 remnants of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces are besieging Xinxiang, threatening Zhengzhou. Over 30,000 men of Liu Bocheng's 236th Detachment vigorously attacked Daxinzhuang and Lihengtun, located six kilometers southeast of Ji County, on the 30th. The defending troops bravely resisted, inflicting over 2,000 casualties on the Communist forces. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. The situation in Hui County on the 30th is also unclear.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 31st] Over 10,000 Communist troops attacked Xiaoji, southwest of Xinxiang, on the 30th. Fierce fighting continued until the 31st at the Zhongyi Railway Stations.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 31st] Over 10,000 Communist troops vigorously attacked the Yellow River Railway Bridge north of Zhengzhou eight or nine times on the 31st, but were repelled each time by the defending troops.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, Central News Agency, 31st] Near the northern bank of the Guangwu Yellow River Railway Bridge, a unit of Communist forces planning to sabotage the bridge was discovered on the 31st. After a search by the National Army, 200 kilograms of explosives were seized and several Communist soldiers were captured. The bridge is currently operating normally.</p>
<h3>National Army Enters Qingjian in Northern Shaanxi; Fierce Battle for Wayaobao Zuocheng; Yan'an Establishes Garrison Headquarters with Wang Yingzun as Commander</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 31st] The National Army stationed in Yanchuan, northern Shaanxi, continued its northward advance. The National Army moving rapidly from Yanshuiguan along the Yellow River towards Qingjian, overcoming the resistance of Communist forces in small and large villages along the riverbanks, suddenly entered Qingjian City at 8:00 PM on the 31st and engaged in fierce street fighting. The four suburbs of the city were re-encircled by the National Army. Three regiments of Communist forces from Jiuli Mountain, nine *li* north of Qingjian, rushed to reinforce. The Communist forces have established a tight defensive posture at locations like Lituo Shop and Sancha Village south of Jiuli Mountain, appearing determined to hold out.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, Central News Agency, 31st] The Yan'an City Garrison Headquarters has recently been established, with Wang Yingzun, commander of the 27th Division, concurrently serving as commander.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 31st] The battle for Wayaobao Zuocheng in northern Shaanxi is fierce. By noon on the 30th, the seesaw battle had been fought several times, with mutual encirclements of seven or eight layers. Zuocheng is over four *li* across, surrounded by five starvation trenches. The eastern mountain highlands are defensible. The National Army based in Youcheng is acting cautiously. 20,000 Communist troops under Gao Zizhu, from the Xiliu Wan Gou area west of Anding, are also coming to reinforce.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, Central News Agency, 31st] The National Army advancing to the outskirts of Qingjian City recovered the city at 3:00 PM on the 31st. This is the seventh major city recovered by the National Army in northern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, Central News Agency, 31st] On March 26th, the Northern Shaanxi National Army Command established the "National Army Service for the People Office" in Yan'an, comprising five departments: livelihood relief, disaster relief, business recovery relief, legal advice, and guidance trusts. It has begun distributing relief funds, with 5,000 yuan per person for those over twelve years old and 2,000 yuan for those under twelve.</p>
<h3>National Army in Various Parts of Northern Shanxi Begins Full-Scale Operations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 31st] The National Army in various parts of northern Shanxi began full-scale operations on the 30th, aiming to completely eliminate the Communist forces in the area, severing their corridor between Shanxi and northern Hebei. The troops recovering Huairin first disembarked at noon on the 30th. By the evening, they had crossed Songjiazhuang. The defending troops inside Ying County City simultaneously launched an attack, engaging in fierce fighting with the Communist forces in the suburbs. The two armies will soon join forces.

<h3>Exchange of Letters Published by British, American, and Soviet Foreign Ministers; Britain Does Not Mention Chinese Intelligence Matters</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Moscow, Central News Agency, 31st] TASS published today the contents of the letters exchanged by Molotov, Marshall, and Bevin on the China issue. Bevin wrote to Molotov stating: The British government cannot provide any intelligence regarding the implementation of the Moscow Resolutions, as the withdrawal of troops stationed in China is the obligation of the American and Soviet governments. He also stated: The British government strictly supports a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Bevin expressed opposition to holding a meeting regarding the implementation of agreements related to China at the Moscow Conference.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Moscow, Associated Press, 31st] It was learned today that the United States has submitted a document to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding the fulfillment of its obligations in China. US Secretary of State Marshall insisted that the discussion of the Chinese situation at the Foreign Ministers' meeting should be limited to the mutual exchange of written information before April 1st, hence the submission of this document. The obligations in China referred to are those stipulated in the 1945 Moscow Agreement of the three major powers. It is believed that Molotov is preparing a similar document outlining the Soviet response. The method of exchanging written information is clearly unsatisfactory to Molotov. Only a few believe that, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, the exchange of information will bring the discussion of the China issue to an end.</p>

<h3>Responsible Official of the Ministry of Finance Issues Statement: Repayment of Principal and Interest on Treasury Bonds and Public Bonds Will Not Be Delayed; Different Methods of Payment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The rules for the collection of funds for the 36-year short-term treasury bonds and US dollar public bonds, the organizational regulations of the Gold Supervisory Committee, and the exchange rate for converting yellow cotton and US dollar public bonds have been announced by the Ministry of Finance today. According to the responsible official of the Ministry of Finance: (1) The payment methods for short-term treasury bonds and US dollar public bonds are different. Treasury bonds should be purchased at the US dollar exchange rate of the Central Bank, converted into US dollars with national currency, while public bonds should be purchased (A) with US dollar deposits or cash; (B) with other foreign currency deposits or cash converted into US dollars according to the Central Bank's exchange rate; (C) paid for in US dollars, the conversion rate is set by the Ministry; the difference between the two is very obvious. (2) The gold conversion rate set by the Ministry of Finance is specifically for the purchase of US dollar public bonds with gold and is separate from the Central Bank's gold redemption rate. (3) The state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet industries designated as collateral for the principal and interest fund of short-term treasury bonds should be designated to a certain number of units. The Ministry has also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Economic Ministry, the Resources Committee, and the Enemy-Puppet Industry Handling Committee to consult with the fund supervisory committee as soon as possible to determine the units and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then to the National Government for official designation. (4) Article 8 of the US Dollar Public Bond Regulations stipulates that "The principal and interest of this public bond shall be prepaid by the National Government, instructing the Central Bank to allocate an equal amount of US dollar foreign exchange from the bank's foreign exchange fund six months before each principal and interest repayment date for storage." The first tranche of this public bond is due at the end of September this year, and the second tranche of the first tranche of bonds and the first tranche of the second tranche of bonds are due at the end of March next year. The Ministry has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan today to instruct the Central Bank to prepay the funds in accordance with the above regulations. Subsequently, each repayment and prepayment of funds should be handled in the same way without delay. (5) The solicitation and sale of short-term treasury bonds and US dollar public bonds have been entrusted to the Central Bank. Before the formal treasury bond bonds are printed, the Central Bank may issue reservation certificates. Once the Central Bank has prepared all the procedures, the bank will announce the start date of the sale so that the people can purchase them. (More news on treasury bonds and public bonds can be found on page six; readers can refer to it.)</p>
<h3>Large Amount of Idle Funds Returns to Peiping; Commercial Bank Deposits Reach 50 Billion; Cleaning Up of Puppet Banks Not Yet Complete</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] The recent economic trends in Peiping are as follows: (1) Since the implementation of emergency economic measures, speculation in Peiping has subsided slightly. In mid-March, the wholesale price index in Peiping showed a trend of large increases and small declines. Idle funds had nowhere to go and temporarily returned, lying dormant in the financial sector. Statistics show that deposits in Peiping's banking industry were more than 29 billion in January, increasing to more than 33 billion in February. In March, there was a large increase, and commercial bank deposits are expected to reach around 50 billion, an increase of about two-fifths compared with the previous month. Whether this good phenomenon of idle funds returning can be maintained for a long time after the gold and silver industry resumes business is being closely watched by the public here. (2) The work of taking over and cleaning up various enemy-puppet banks in Peiping has not been fully completed in the past year and a half, because each bank still exists, and the situation of branches in various places is too complicated and involves too much. It is reported that the puppet Jidong Bank was cleared up last month and is in the process of being formally dissolved. The puppet Korean United Bank and other banks still have many remaining tasks, and it will take at least next month to complete them all. The Mengjiang Bank still has no good cleaning up plan. Although the Central Bank recently announced measures for the return of deposits from the Peiping branch of the Mengjiang Bank, no one has yet come to inquire about them, because the puppet currency is returned at a rate of five to one, and prices are high, so previous deposits are now worthless. In order to complete the cleaning up work as soon as possible, a new institution may be established recently.</p>

<h3>Shipping Line Between Hankou and Changde Had an Accident; Yongfeng Vessel Exploded and Sank; Overloading Caused the Disaster; 17 Crew Members Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 31st] Confirmed information: The "Yongfeng" vessel, owned by the Hunan Civilian Shipping Bureau and operated by Changjin Shipping Company, sailed from Hankou to Changde on the 25th. When it arrived near Yanziwo, downstream of Jiayu, at noon on the 26th, the vessel's boiler suddenly exploded, killing eight crew members and injuring nine. The vessel sank immediately. After the Shipping Administration Bureau sent personnel to investigate, the company falsely claimed that it was returning empty to Hunan. After many investigations, it was learned that the cause of the accident was that the vessel towed four ships in the middle of the journey (shipping regulations only allow two), resulting in overloading. The vessel's boiler pressure exceeded the approved limit, so it could not bear the burden and an explosion occurred. The bureau decided on the following penalties: (1) The Changjin Company's vessels are prohibited from sailing on the Hankou-Changde route for three years; (2) The vessel's captain Cha Chailian and chief engineer Fu Jinsheng are prohibited from employment for three years; (3) The criminal part is transferred to the court for handling.</p>

<h3>Singapore Discriminates Against Overseas Chinese; Implements Quarantine in Port</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Hope Government Will Negotiate Quickly</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 31st] Some shipping companies here have recently received a notice from the Singapore Port Quarantine Station stating that all ships sailing to Singapore from any port must stop at nearby small islands for strict quarantine and injections.

When our ships arrive in Singapore, passengers must be concentrated in designated locations, and men, women, and children must be naked for strict inspection. Only those who are considered free of infectious diseases are allowed to enter the port, and it takes several days. Overseas Chinese feel very inconvenienced and hope that the government will negotiate quickly.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issuance of US Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>The issuance of 300 million US dollar Treasury bills and 100 million US dollar government bonds, half of which begins today, is of great significance, as this newspaper pointed out in an article on the 28th, and various other analyses have been quite detailed. However, we feel that there are still two points that need to be further elaborated.</p>
<p>The first concerns the credit of our national bonds. There is little doubt about the creditworthiness of our national bonds. However, (1) since the beginning of the War of Resistance, the currency has gradually inflated, and the value of the currency has fallen daily. Whether public or private bonds, the creditors have suffered too much hidden losses, which has discouraged the interest of general investors. (2) All original government bonds are still repaying principal and interest according to the old rules. The rumors circulating in the securities market about repayment at several times the original value have ultimately proven to be just rumors. Therefore, there is inevitable apprehension about investing in government bonds. (3) The four-fold gold deposit contribution during the War of Resistance dealt a significant blow to national credit. After the victory, there was an unusually large amount of floating capital, and at the same time, the financial situation was extremely difficult. Many people advocated issuing government bonds to make adjustments. However, the government has always taken it seriously and has been reluctant to try it lightly. This is due to these reasons.</p>
<p>Since the decision to issue US dollar Treasury bills and US dollar government bonds, the government has made great efforts to remedy these past weaknesses. First, it decided to use the US dollar as the standard to strengthen public confidence. When repaying principal and interest, although the Treasury bills are still paid in national currency, it is stipulated that they will be converted according to the central bank's US dollar exchange rate on the payment date. For government bonds, the National Government specifically stipulates that they will be paid in US dollar foreign exchange. This measure will naturally dispel the general public's concerns about the value of the currency. Moreover, (1) a fund supervision committee is organized, and representatives of civil groups are specially permitted to participate, (2) guarantees are designated and deposited in advance, and (3) repeated statements are made to respect credit. Finance Minister Yu also assured the Legislative Yuan in his capacity as Finance Minister that the organization of the fund supervision committee will be as open and sound as possible. The purpose of these measures is clearly to restore national credit and consolidate the inherent value of the bonds themselves. The impact of this will not only be that the US dollar bonds can be expected to achieve good results, but also that the public's confidence in the country can be expected to increase as a result. If this intangible income can be calculated in currency, we believe that it will definitely not be less than 400 million US dollars. This is worth mentioning solemnly.</p>
<p>Secondly, concerning the issuance, the authorities have repeatedly stated that the above-mentioned bonds will be purchased freely by the public and that no quota system will be adopted. This point is particularly important. Since our country has had public bonds, in fact, it is probably not true that it has completely broken ties with the word "quota." Whether central or local, all public bonds are somewhat related to quotas or forced solicitation. It is relatively polite to use righteousness to persuade people to purchase them, but sometimes it is also heard of people being sealed off and detained, extorted in every way, and having certain crimes added to them if they respond a little late. Because these methods are too reluctant, the two words "public bonds" have been deeply shrouded in a black shadow, making it difficult for people to develop a good impression. Therefore, this time, we only use the method of promotion and do not use coercive methods. We actually do the work of solicitation and do not use compulsory methods. On this point alone, we already believe that it is a great success in finance, and there is no need to ask what the result of the issuance will be.</p>
<p>The state issues public bonds, in most cases, it is always out of financial purposes. In other words, all citizens have the responsibility to contribute their strength and money in terms of morality. The reason why we emphasize the phrase "free subscription" is, of course, that only in this way is the government's approach reasonable and legal, and only in this way is it worthy of the style of democratic politics. Therefore, on the day of the initial issuance, we would like to add a few words to wish the issuance success and to hope that this reasonable and legal path will be earnestly extended to the entire financial system and even the entire political system.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Constitutional Grand Law</h3>
<p>The ten major laws and regulations concerning the implementation of the Constitution, after careful discussion by the Legislative Yuan for nearly a week regardless of festivals or holidays, were all completed in the legislative process at 8:00 PM on the 30th. Among these ten types of laws and regulations, four are election and recall laws, and six are organizational laws. The National Assembly Organization Law was first completed on the 25th, and the National Assembly Delegate Election and Recall Law and the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law were passed on the 28th. The Legislative Committee and Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law and the Organization Law of the Five Yuan were also completed in the legislative process on the 30th. Within this short period of time, the legislature was able to complete the legislation of these ten major laws concerning the implementation of the Constitution as scheduled. We express our infinite respect to the members of the Legislative Yuan for their loyalty to the country and their tireless work under the leadership of President Sun. Since these ten major laws and regulations concerning the implementation of the Constitution have been formulated, there will be guidelines to follow regarding the implementation of the Constitution in the future, which is actually opening a great road for the constitutional rule of our country.</p>
<p>Looking at the formulation of these ten major laws and regulations as a whole, although it adheres to the spirit of the constitution and our country's established national policies, there are also some changes to the existing system. The abolition of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Food, and the establishment of the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Water Resources, are examples. In addition, the regulations on the number of seats for professional groups and women are also attracting attention from all parties. Professional and women's groups have repeatedly appealed for the allocation of seats, but the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan have not adopted these appeals. From the perspective of the normal path of the nation, the nation, and democratic constitutionalism, the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan, while complying with the established national policy of allowing representatives of professional and women's groups, place their emphasis on the entire people, which is indeed a wise move. We have not seen the abolition of representatives of professional and women's groups in the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan, only that the number of seats allocated may not have satisfied the hopes of the professional and women's groups. This is already a result of compromise. In theory, if we refer to the precedents of British and American democratic politics, it is already a great privilege to specifically allocate seats for professional and women's groups in our election law provisions. Our election law has already adopted both regional elections and occupational elections; the adoption of occupational elections was originally intended to supplement the shortcomings of regional elections. Theoretically speaking, the election law passed by the Legislative Yuan this time does not seem to be a misstep and should be unanimously embraced by the people.</p>
<p>Speaking of the revision of the system, the Ministry of Food was originally a wartime institution, and now it is abolished, which is also fully justified. The functions of the Ministry of Social Affairs are extremely unclear, some belonging to the Ministry of Interior and some belonging to the Ministry of Health. The organization of people's groups should originally be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior; as for training, that is another matter. Now, the Administrative Yuan Organization Law passed by the Legislative Yuan abolishes the Ministry of Social Affairs and establishes a Ministry of Labor to focus on the welfare of farmers and workers, which is also a wise move. What we feel is regrettable is the establishment of the Ministry of Border Affairs. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee had a resolution, and there was also such a proposal at this Legislative Yuan meeting, but it was rejected due to a lack of majority support. In addition, the organizations of the Control Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Examination Yuan have also been repeatedly revised; in adhering to the spirit of the Constitution, a solid foundation for constitutional government is established. From now on, the implementation of constitutional government will have a track to follow. The completion of the legislation of these ten major laws and regulations concerning the implementation of the Constitution is truly an unprecedented event in our country's legal history.</p>

<h3>Beginning Review of Core German Issues - Foreign Ministers' Conference Nearing Decision Stage - Stettinius Arrives in Moscow, Will Meet Stalin</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Taiwan News Agency, Moscow, 31st] The Foreign Ministers' Conference has now touched upon the central issues of the German question. Today's debate on economic issues may reveal whether the conference has reached a fundamental decision on the German question.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 30th] Foreign sources close to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference stated today that the success of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is likely to be determined next week, as the Four Foreign Ministers will resolve the most important points of the German peace treaty within the next week. The attitude of the United States has changed, but Secretary of State Marshall's eagerness to return home is a problem that all parties attach great importance to. It is rumored that the Four Foreign Ministers may continue the conference for five or six weeks. Stettinius, a Republican candidate for the US presidency in 1948, has arrived in Moscow. This trip is clearly unrelated to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, but according to American sources here, Stettinius immediately requested a meeting with Marshal Stalin after arriving here. It is also possible that Marshall will also request a meeting with the Marshal.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, England, 30th] Observers believe that the success or failure of the Moscow Conference will be revealed in the next three or four days. For the past three weeks, the conference's work has focused on presenting the positions of the Allied countries on the German economic system and other issues. Starting tomorrow, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will enter the most important stage of discussion, studying the following three issues that have been agreed upon as the most important: (1) Germany is regarded as a whole economic unit, and the level of German industry and the issue of reparations are reviewed. (2) Eliminate Germany's military power. (3) The form and powers of the German Provisional Government. The general opinions of the four powers on the German question are now clear. From now on, solutions will be proposed to allow the parties to agree on their opinions. Observers expect that the four powers all have a plan in mind, but they are unwilling to reveal it in advance. Now all parties admit that in order to issue work instructions to the Allied Control Council, some compromises must first be made. The question is when and on what matters can compromises be made. German economic unification does not seem possible for the time being, and there are also vast differences between the opinions of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union on the issue of extracting industrial products as reparations. As for the future constitution of Germany and the elimination of German military power, there seems to be hope for compromise. Observers also expect that an agreement can be reached at the Moscow Conference on the issue of convening a German peace conference and consulting the opinions of other allied countries. The hope that the Austrian treaty can be discussed and completed in Moscow has weakened again due to the stalemate between the powers on the definition of German funds in Austria. It is expected that the Soviet Union will only be able to make concessions on German funds in Austria after it is satisfied with other reparations in Germany.</p>
<h3>Tito's Speech Accuses the United States</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 31st] President Tito, in a speech to the Yugoslav National Assembly today, accused the United States of attempting to dominate all of Yugoslavia. He stated that the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Patterson, should be held responsible for the deterioration of US-Yugoslav relations and that Greece has become the foundation for imperialists to threaten peace in the Balkans and the world. Tito also insisted that the Austrian province of Carinthia should be ceded to Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 30th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic, en route from Belgrade to Moscow to present his views to the Council of Foreign Ministers, spoke to reporters in Rome today, commenting on the importance of Yugoslavia's participation in a peace conference with Germany and the US refusal to aid Yugoslavia. He stated, "We are going to Moscow not to propose any new suggestions, but only to reiterate the suggestions we made to the Council of Foreign Ministers in London. We will insist on these suggestions because the peace treaty with Germany constitutes an important issue for us."</p>
<h3>The Three Major Aspirations of German Workers</h3>

<h3>Marshall Watches a Soviet Ballet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall attended a performance at the Starry-Eyed Ballet this morning. He expressed great admiration for the principal dancer, the multi-talented young ballerina Plisetskaya. Mr. Marshall was accompanied by Ambassador Smith, Foster, Dulles, Murphy, and several other dignitaries to watch the performance.

The youthful dancer repeatedly bowed to the guest box to express her gratitude and sent flying kisses.</p>
<h3>Soviets Strictly Forbid Journalists from Taking Pictures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 31st] The Soviets have only one major objection to photojournalists: their photography. During a period of more than two weeks that journalists spent in Moscow, the Soviets allowed them to visit the meeting room of the Council of Foreign Ministers for only two minutes. We were not allowed to photograph almost anything in the city, not even the hotel where we were staying. Every time we went out for a walk, we were followed by a tall secret police representative and uniformed police officers. When a reporter took out a camera in the Moscow market, a policeman ran over, shook his finger, and the reporter was arrested. However, he was finally released an hour later.</p>
<h3>Czech Ministry of Defense Expresses Willingness to Pledge Allegiance to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 31st] Czech Defense Minister Svoboda delivered a speech to coal miners today, welcoming the recently signed treaty with the Soviet Union. He stated that this could be seen as a security protection system established by Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union to prevent German aggression. In the future, we will implement a foreign policy of cooperation with all countries that love democracy, freedom, and peace in the world, especially to work together with the Soviet Union. Our country is located between the Soviet Union and Germany, so we should determine our entire foreign policy based on this fact. The Soviet Union protects our country and guarantees our freedom and peace, and we should be loyal to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>US Aid Plan to Greece and Turkey: The Focus is on Turkey; US Ambassador to Turkey Reports to the Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee secretly heard opinions on the aid to Greece and Turkey last week, it was learned that the key to taking action to prevent the spread of Communism in the Mediterranean is Turkey, not Greece. Government officials stated today that it was expected that some members would publicly oppose aid to Turkey, but even among those who support the President's plan, there is still a lack of enthusiasm for Turkey. During the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's secret hearing, US Ambassador to Turkey Wilson attended and presented his views. Most of the details are expected to be released in the future. According to a senator who spoke to reporters, Wilson's attendance was noteworthy, and he concluded that the President's proposal was based more on military considerations than on political considerations. Wilson also stated that Turkey is currently the last strong government in the Mediterranean resisting the Soviet Union. Once Turkey falters, Iran, Iraq, Arab countries, and others will be forced to submit to Communist forces, opening up the Middle East and allowing the Soviet Union to enter. Although Turkey is currently capable of coping, it is feared that it will not be able to sustain itself for long. A large standing army is not only depleting its finances but also exhausting its manpower. The Soviet troops stationed on the Turkish border, although not directly threatening it, have forced Turkey to maintain a large army.</p>
<h3>US Senator Wiley Suggests Forming a European Democratic Federation; The Soviet Union and Other Countries Should be Excluded</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Senator Wiley suggested today forming a European Democratic Federation with the United Nations, excluding the Soviet Union and its "satellite states." According to Wiley, he will recommend to Congress that the State Department facilitate a European Federation to protect the political, economic, social, and religious freedom of each country from interference by the Soviet Union and its satellite states. Wiley continued that the Soviet Union and other countries should be excluded because it is difficult to expect them to cooperate with democratic countries. His suggestion is in accordance with President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Breaks Silence: Calls for Cooperation between Britain and France, Dissatisfied with the French Constitution; Prime Minister Ramadier Retorts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] General de Gaulle, breaking six months of silence, spoke to the French people today on a small hill on Brunval beach, twelve miles north of Le Havre, where British and Canadian commandos, supplied with intelligence by French underground operatives, raided and destroyed German radio equipment on the night of February 28, 1942. De Gaulle said that divided opinions, a symbol of decline, have overshadowed the interests of the country. He strongly called for the unity of France and cooperation between Britain and France, hoping that one day the French people would abandon their struggle in the dark. About 10,000 people were present at De Gaulle's speech, including British Ambassador Terfur Cooper and Canadian Ambassador Vanier. De Gaulle also personally laid the foundation stone for a monument to the British and Canadian commandos. After De Gaulle's speech, the crowd repeatedly shouted "De Gaulle in power."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] General de Gaulle's speech was almost entirely devoted to praising the work of the French Resistance. Only at the end did he directly mention French domestic politics. When he mentioned that France was struggling in an unhealthy system, he was clearly referring to the Constitution. In De Gaulle's view, the current French Constitution cannot lead to France's revival. This is why De Gaulle is unwilling to agree to a comeback under the current Constitution, even if advised by the government. But it is clear that De Gaulle is now waiting for his moment. Prime Minister Ramadier has decided to respond immediately after receiving the full text of De Gaulle's speech, which is of great significance. Ramadier delivered a speech in Gatineck today, emphasizing that the Republic is the only political system that can lead to France's revival, stressing that the unity of France's strength is forged by a common concept, not by the temporary brilliance of one person. According to political observers, the arguments in Ramadier's and De Gaulle's speeches are completely opposed. But how this opposition will develop and what the consequences will be will not be clear until De Gaulle delivers another speech in Strasbourg.</p>
<h3>The United States May Return the Korean Issue to the Four Powers for Joint Resolution</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] State Department officials recently declared that, after being disappointed in seeking an agreement with the Soviet Union on the Korean issue, the United States may decide to return the issue to the four powers that signed the agreement on Korea in Moscow in December 1945 for resolution. It is said that General Hodge, commander of the US occupying forces in South Korea, also proposed this approach during consultations in Washington last month, saying that seeking an agreement with the Soviet side in Korea is futile and that it would be better to talk directly with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It is understood that the main policies of the United States towards Korea are as follows: (1) To continue to urge the Soviet Union to fulfill the Moscow Agreement; (2) To provide economic assistance in South Korea to strengthen democratic politics and gradually return power to the Korean people.</p>
<p>Hodge's Transfer Rumors Denied by the State Department</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Lieutenant General Hilldring, Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Occupied Territories Affairs, stated today that, to his knowledge, the report by a certain radio station that Lieutenant General Lee Qiwei, the US representative on the United Nations Military Staff Committee, will replace Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in Korea, is completely inaccurate. "I have not heard of this matter. If this were true, I would know about it." Radio commentator Pierson had stated that, due to the increasing difficulties in Korea, Lieutenant General Lee Qiwei would replace Lieutenant General Hodge, so that if MacArthur returned to the United States, Lee Qiwei could take over his remaining position. At the same time, Fan Xuande, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department, also said that he had not heard of this plan. According to well-informed sources, high-ranking officials here have decided to order Hodge to return to Korea to implement the economic and political plans for aiding South Korea that have been formulated in Washington.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] According to well-informed sources close to General Hodge, commander of the US occupying forces in Korea, the United States will take a tougher stance towards the Soviet Union on the Korean issue and may even launch an economic offensive. Hodge's trip to Washington was responsible for changing US policy towards Korea. The United States is about to launch an economic offensive against the Soviet Union, lending six hundred million US dollars to South Korea within the next three years, or even demanding that the Soviet Union also work to promote the revival of North Korea while the United States lends money to South Korea.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Locomotives Shipped to South Korea in Batches</p>

Also yesterday, a British police officer was ambushed and killed by Jewish terrorists.</p>
<h3>Busy Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 31st] The United Nations organization has entered a busy week. The Palestinian issue is expected to be formally raised this week, and the US plan to take over the Japanese-mandated islands will also be put to a final vote. Regarding the latter, US officials are confident that the Security Council meeting on Wednesday can be put to a vote. In fact, the only countries that directly oppose the US plan are New Zealand, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, whose five votes are still an obstacle. New Zealand suggests that the agreement for the United States to take over the islands should not be considered final until after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet Union suggests that the Security Council has the right to amend the agreement. The United Kingdom demands that all United Nations countries have equal economic rights on these islands.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] The new Japanese political party, the "Democratic Party," was established today. It has 143 prominent members in the current Diet, two more than the largest Japanese party, the Liberal Party. Some observers predict that the competition for second place between the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party in the April elections will be very fierce, while the first place will undoubtedly belong to the Liberal Party.

<h3>Considering the Livelihood of Former Employees of the Ex-Concessions After Retirement, Decision to Request the Executive Yuan to Allocate Funds for Emergency Relief: The Clearing Committee Held a Preparatory Meeting Yesterday, Agreeing on Six Points; Date of Payment to Await Central Government Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Committee for Clearing the Official Assets and Obligations of the Former Public and French Concessions held a preparatory meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall Auditorium. In attendance were Gu Chunfan, Zhu Ping, Hu Wenyuan, Zhao Zengjue, Tang Xingyi, Zha Liangjian, He DeKui, Zhang Fuyun of the Ministry of Finance, Chen Guolian of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others, with Mayor Wu serving as chairman. Participants exchanged opinions, and the meeting adjourned at 5:45 PM. Afterwards, Mayor Wu told reporters that the issues were very complex and that there was still no comprehensive or concrete solution. The committee will convene a formal general meeting on April 3rd. In order to consider the livelihood of various retired employees, the meeting resolved to immediately submit a document to the Executive Yuan requesting the advance allocation of a portion of funds for emergency relief, amounting to approximately 11 billion yuan. Regarding the issue of repayment multiples, Mr. Wu stated that the principle would be not to exceed the current multiple of civil servants' salaries. The final decision rests with the central government, as the municipal government lacks the funds to repay.</p>
<p>The matters discussed at yesterday's meeting were mostly based on the draft resolution of the previous Small Group Committee on the Rights and Interests of Retired Personnel from the Former Public Concession under the Finance Bureau. After discussion and research, the committee reached the following agreements: (1) Regarding the following four items: savings, salary savings, service excellence bonuses, and retirement pay, an initial temporary payment should be made first. Pensions for personnel who retired on or before December 31, 1941, must also be paid immediately and all arrears should be paid accordingly. (2) Calculation Cutoff Date: The aforementioned four rights and interests shall be calculated up to the end of December 1941 and paid in full. (3) Foreign Currency: Sums payable in foreign currency or sums in national currency that the former Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) regulations specified should be converted to foreign currency at the exchange rate should be paid in foreign currency. (4) National Currency: Sums payable in national currency shall be increased and paid according to the salary multiple and other additional factors of municipal government employees at the time of payment. (5) The aforementioned items should be paid in the shortest possible time and should not be delayed without reason. (6) The payment of the aforementioned four items in accordance with this agreement is an initial temporary payment on account and is not a final determination of the total amount due, nor shall the method of calculation be regarded as fixed and unchangeable. This agreement does not resolve the issue of interest and subsidies arising from dismissal. This agreement does not confirm that employees after December 31, 1941, shall not be entitled to compensation.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, representatives of Chinese employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department, Shen Yaoting, Wu Xucheng, Lang Haiqing, Ren Zhigang, Chen Tingju, Lu Jiandong, and others went to the municipal government to hear the response. More than a thousand employees gathered in the Children's Garden on Suzhou Road and collectively surged to the front of the municipal government building to petition. Upon hearing the news, the mayor was extremely angered and ordered them to disperse immediately, otherwise, the matter would not be handled and the matter would be reported to the central government for cancellation. The petitioning crowd immediately obeyed the order and dispersed, leaving representatives to await news.</p>
<p>After the preparatory meeting adjourned, Mayor Wu immediately met with the petitioning representatives in the conference room and informed them that the committee had decided to submit a document to the Executive Yuan within days, requesting an allocation of 11 billion yuan for compensation. The representatives inquired about the date of payment. Mayor Wu replied that he had no authority to decide and that it would depend on the approval of the central government. The mayor also expressed great dissatisfaction with the repeated gathering of crowds for petitions despite warnings, claiming that the municipal government had done its utmost. Some of the representatives immediately stated that they were senior officials of the former Shanghai Municipal Council and also valued their dignity, and did not wish to show their faces in public. It was only because since the victory, there had been no definite news of compensation, and most of the employees were struggling to make a living, so they were eager to know the exact date of payment. However, the mayor refused to answer the question about the date and immediately rose and left.</p>
<h3>Zhengtai, Biochemical, and Dachina: Gold Purchase Case Dismissed; Loans Had Legal Contracts, Not Constituting Fraud</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the case of Zhengtai Xinji Rubber Factory, China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory, and Dachina Paper Factory using production loans to purchase and hoard gold and US dollars, suspected of disrupting finance and fraud, the District Prosecutor's Office Prosecutor Li Mingshan has completed the investigation and believes that the defendants, Hong Fumei, head of Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Ni Shuzu and He Yichao, heads of Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory, and Liu Xingsun, Dai Huantang, Zhou Shuhua, and Wang Wende, heads of Dachina Paper Factory, should be prosecuted. At the end of last year, Zhengtai and other three factories had problems with capital turnover. After being approved by the Provisional Review Committee for Production Loans of the Four Banks Joint Office, all used 70% of the estimated value of finished products and raw materials as collateral. Zhengtai obtained 800 million yuan, Biochemical obtained 500 million yuan, and Dachina obtained 500 million yuan. The contracts all stated that the loans were specifically designated for purchasing raw materials and increasing production and should not be used for other purposes. Later, Dachina Paper Factory purchased 750 taels of gold on January 7, and Biochemical also purchased 370 taels of gold and 6,635 US dollars on January 20. Zhengtai also purchased more than 500 taels of gold on the 21st and 31st. After being discovered by the roving audit team of the Four Banks Joint Office, the matter was reported by the Supervisory Committee to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on suspicion of disrupting finance and obtaining loans by fraudulent means. Regarding the part of disrupting finance, the prosecutor believed that the principle of law does not apply retroactively is the principle of criminal legislation. The defendants purchased and sold gold before January 31 of this year. At that time, the Economic Emergency Measures Plan had not been promulgated, and the gold was allocated and sold by the Central Bank. Even if the defendants' actions had an impact on financial fluctuations, there was no explicit provision in the law at that time to punish them. We can hardly punish them in law. Regarding the part of fraud, the production loan is a civil pledge contract between the government and the commercial factories. The government lends funds, the commercial factories pay interest, and goods are used as collateral. Moreover, the Four Banks Joint Office had carefully reviewed the contract before signing it. Therefore, the defendants' acquisition of loans did not involve any fraud. Moreover, the purchase and sale of gold and US dollars were legal at that time. Even if the defendants profited from purchasing gold with loans, it was not an illegal acquisition. It does not meet the constituent elements of the crime of fraud. The defendants also presented the accounts of their respective operating manufacturers, proving that all the production loans had indeed been used to purchase raw materials, and that the purchase of gold and US dollars was actually to repay debts. Based on the above facts and reasons, Prosecutor Li acquitted them in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<h3>Liu Xun's Traitor Case Continues; Lian Shi Town's Reply Proves the Crime; Defendant Cunningly Claims to Be Framed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Xun, the former captain of the Supplement Team of the Third Brigade of the Pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Security Force, who was previously sentenced to death by the High Court, has been returned by the Supreme Court for reconsideration. The case was reopened for investigation and interrogation in the High Court on February 14. It was continued yesterday afternoon. Liu was wearing a gray wool tweed jacket and spoke with a Hunan accent. Judge Qiu showed the defendant the reply from Wu and the local court, which was investigated and replied by Wu Benli, the head of Lian Shi Town, and others, proving that Liu Dong did commit rape, looting, and murder while stationed in Lian Shi Town. The defendant still tried to deny it, claiming: I run a cigarette shop in Lian Shi Town. When the Third Brigade of the Pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Security Force was stationed in Lian Shi Town, the team commander He Jianzhang was a fellow villager from Hunan, so I hung a team adjutant title in the supplement team. I left Lian Shi Town in February 34 and went to Shanghai. The informant Qian Minxing was eyeing my property. Wu Benli, the head of Lian Shi Town, gave false testimony because he failed to borrow money from me. I don't know the victims at all. It's purely Wu Benli and Qian Minxing framing me. It's really a grievance. Finally, I requested the court to summon witnesses Zhou, the manager of the Changsha Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Zhou Axiang, a resident of Lian Shi Town, and Sun Fengshun. At this point in the trial, it was decided to postpone the interrogation again and the defendant was sent back to custody.</p>
<h3>Average Price Difference of Six Kinds of Daily Necessities in March: Social Bureau Announced Yesterday; Actual Subsidy of 73,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The average market price difference in March compared with January for the six main daily necessities of municipal workers was officially announced yesterday by the Social Bureau, totaling 72,863 yuan, which will be issued at 73,000 yuan. Every worker in this city who is paid based on the cost of living index will receive a salary in March, in addition to being calculated based on 7,945 times the worker's cost of living index in January and 6,614 times for employees, and the factory will subsidize each person 73,000 yuan. This number is the same as the difference in February (the actual amount in February was 72,965 yuan, which was also calculated and issued at 73,000 yuan). The reason is that the market prices of the six main daily necessities in March, compared with the market prices in February, only coal balls and bean oil rose slightly, while Xian rice, table salt, sugar, and cloth all fell back. Therefore, the actual difference is still 102 yuan smaller compared with February. The detailed difference between March and January is listed as follows:</p>

Resolution: The matter will be submitted to the government for confirmation by the board of directors and supervisors.

<h3>Case of Accusation of Killing Cousin: Gu Minyuan's Trial Concluded Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Gu Minyuan, the head of the militia team of Guminqiao Township, Haimen, who was accused of killing his cousin Gu Minjiu (the local Communist Party's financial and economic assistant), was tried in the District Court yesterday. The plaintiff, Gu Dechun (the victim's father, the defendant's uncle), stated: On January 19 of this year, the defendant invited Minjiu to gamble at home. At midnight, the victim's wife suddenly heard loud voices outside the room, and stray dogs were barking. She heard her husband cry out "Help!" and then heard the defendant say: "I'll beat you to death." Soon, everything gradually quieted down. Gu Minjiu's wife, Zhang Peiyu, rushed out to investigate and saw that her husband's body was pierced with sharp knife holes, covered in blood, and had died. At that time, because Gu Minyuan was the head of the militia team and had 36 militiamen under his command, they ran rampant in the village, and no one dared to reason with them. On February 13 of this year, Gu Minyuan was also squeezed out by Communist Party members and could not stand his ground, so he fled to Shanghai, which led to his arrest. The defendant, Gu Minyuan, stated during the trial yesterday: He joined the Communist Party at the age of sixteen and was devoted to socialism. His cousin Gu Minjiu, who served as the financial and economic assistant, was sentenced to death for violating party regulations due to embezzlement of public grain and other corrupt acts, but he was not the one who killed him. He now feels that the Communist Party's words and deeds are inconsistent, and donating land and money is too meaningless, so he came to live in Shanghai. After the debate, the court concluded the trial and scheduled the verdict for April 4.</p>

According to their confession: one is named Zhao Wenxiang, also known as Xiao Chongming, and the other is Chen A-lou, nicknamed Wang Jinlong. There is also an accomplice, Ji Linbao, on the run. At around 10:00 a.m., the three of them saw a person riding a rickshaw near Sichuan North Road and Qiujiang Road. The back of the rickshaw was equipped with a fashion paper box containing two coats. Zhao Fei stepped forward and used a knife to cut the main rope, took the box, took out the woman's coat, and wrapped it in his own floral cloth before fleeing. Upon inspecting the inside of the coat, the police officers saw the words "Hongxia Fashion Company" embroidered on it. They telegraphed the company, who stated that Zhang A-san, who worked at the store, was taking a coat by rickshaw to the Shi family in Hengfeng Lane, Shigaota Road, but it was stolen on the way and had been reported to the company. Soon, Tang Xuefei, a representative of the company, and Zhang A-san arrived at the police station and identified the coat as correct and immediately took it back. The name of this group of thieves is "Fast Horse Killers," specializing in stealing goods from rickshaws, tiger cars, etc., cutting the ropes with knives and escaping. They also confessed to five previous cases. The case has now been investigated and is planned to be submitted to the judicial authorities for trial in the near future.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Red Cross Hospital Co-sponsors Free Childbirth Assistance for Poor Women</h3>
<p>Cooperation method is handled in accordance with the simple rules agreed upon between this newspaper and Renhe Hospital. This newspaper, in view of the fact that many poor women in general often damage the health of themselves and their babies due to their inability to afford childbirth expenses, deeply feels that providing relief for "childbirth assistance for poor women" is a pressing task. Therefore, at the beginning of February of this year, it jointly organized the "Free Childbirth Assistance Movement for Poor Women" with Renhe Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital at No. 36 Xiangshan Road in this city. Since it began on February 9, the number of pregnant women applying for assistance in February alone has reached over a hundred. After investigation by this newspaper, except for a small number whose family circumstances are still good, the assistance was temporarily deferred, and all were approved. All approved pregnant women went to the hospital for a physical examination at the designated time and were hospitalized to await delivery. All miscellaneous expenses were waived. On average, each pregnant woman stayed in the hospital for ten days and was treated according to the latest methods, so fortunately, no unfortunate events have occurred, which is also gratifying. Since this newspaper launched the movement, all sectors of society have expressed deep concern, and letters providing opinions have arrived daily. Recently, this newspaper received a letter from the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Huashan Road in this city, responding to this movement and expressing its willingness to join in cooperation and serve the community together. The letter stated in brief: "Regarding the method for poor women to apply for childbirth assistance, our hospital can refer to the method agreed upon between your newspaper and Renhe Hospital for cooperative handling." The people of this newspaper were deeply admired after reading it. It is now decided to formally cooperate on free childbirth assistance matters from today. From now on, all applicants residing in the Western District will be sent to the hospital to await delivery. It is found that this childbirth assistance movement is in its initial stage, and we have been misguidedly encouraged by all circles. We hope that all enthusiastic people and philanthropists at sea will donate more to support this grand undertaking, which will not only be fortunate for poor pregnant women but also a blessing for the country and the nation.</p>

<h3>Letter of Correction</h3>
<p>Having read the news about our college in the Wuhu correspondence published in your newspaper on the 20th of this month, it does not correspond with the facts. Upon investigation, our college does not have a "Purge Committee" and Cheng Tiao Fan has never been appointed as the Director of General Affairs. The alleged student strikes and shootings are even more unfounded. During his year as president, President Cheng did a lot of planning and building in a difficult environment. His integrity, moral character, and literary talent are highly respected by all teachers and students in the college. Since last year, President Cheng has repeatedly resigned to the provincial government due to illness, but has not been approved. Recently, after Chairman Li came to Wuhu, he resigned again, and Chairman Li could not retain him and reluctantly granted his request. Chairman Li and all the teachers and students of the college expressed deep regret. Remote rumors are inaccurate. We hereby request that you correct the errors. Secretariat of Anhui College (March 28th)</p>

<h3>Central Bank Rediscount and Loan Committee Holds Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; President Zhang Hopes to Establish a New Financial System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank Rediscount and Loan Committee held its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the conference room on the third floor of the bank. President Zhang, Vice President Liu, Committee Chairman Qin Runqing, Vice Chairmen Pan Shouheng and Wu Kejia, Committee members Xu Guomao, Li Daonan, Luo Qinghua, Ju Yihong, Shen Rixin, Lu Shuchen, and Wang Zishuang attended. The following were discussed: (1) Amendments passed to the General Rules for Shanghai Commercial Bank's Rediscount Loans. (2) Submitted the list of the Industrial Loan and Export Material Loan Review Committees, to be appointed by the Central Bank. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>According to the Central Bank, its rediscount business has always been conducted through the Four Joint Offices and handled for national banks. Last year, the measures for rediscounting and re-pledging were established, and commercial banks applying to the Central Bank for rediscounting, re-pledging, and re-discounting of foreign exchange were organized by banking syndicates or limited to designated banks handling foreign exchange. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. Recently, after President Zhang took office, in order to further strengthen the cooperation between national banks and commercial banks, and to fully supply production funds, with a view to coordinating with the emergency economic measures plan and the economic reform plan passed by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, it was decided to expand the rediscount business. In addition to continuing to handle business for national banks through the Four Joint Offices, a Rediscount and Loan Committee was created within the Central Bank to handle the review of Shanghai commercial banks' applications for rediscount, re-pledging, and re-discounting of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Two Loan Review Committees Established</p>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, President Zhang read out the articles of the Rediscount Regulations and explained them item by item. The main points of his explanation are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The new method establishes a Rediscount and Loan Committee with representatives from the China Communications Bank and commercial banks, as well as representatives from the Clearing House. An Industrial Loan Review Committee is also established, with representatives from the industrial sector and bankers with experience in industrial loans. In addition, an Export Material Loan Review Committee is established, with representatives from the export industry and bankers with experience in export loans, so that the Central Bank and national banks, commercial banks, and the financial sector and the industrial and commercial sectors are integrated into an organic financial and commercial organization. Like the arm being used by the body, and the fingers being used by the arm, they are not only interdependent but also mutually disciplined and jointly bear the mission of economic revival.</p>
<p>(2) The applications submitted by commercial banks or syndicates will first be reviewed by the committee, and after being approved by the President and Vice President of the Central Bank, they will be submitted to the Business Bureau for rediscount, re-pledging, or re-discounting of foreign exchange. The Central Bank's handling of this rediscount business is based on the majority vote, so as to ensure its fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>(3) In the past, commercial banks applied to the Central Bank for rediscounting through banking syndicates, and the syndicates applied to the Central Bank. The new method takes the application by the bank alone to the Rediscount and Loan Committee as the principle. Only if the Rediscount and Loan Committee considers it necessary to form a syndicate to handle the application, will the syndicate apply, so that each bank can exert its effectiveness and avoid the drawbacks of procrastination caused by the organization of groups.</p>
<p>(4) In the past, commercial banks were limited to 200 million yuan for each rediscount and re-pledge and 300 million yuan for each re-discount of foreign exchange according to the banking syndicate method. The new method stipulates that the total amount of the original loan applied for by each bank for rediscount, re-pledging, and re-discounting of foreign exchange shall not exceed the bank's paid-up capital and the total amount of deposits at the end of last month (excluding the total amount of statutory deposit reserve), which is wider than in the past. In particular, using the bank's total deposit amount as the standard can further promote banks to devote themselves to attracting deposits.</p>
<p>(5) What the industrial sector currently finds most difficult is that in the intermediate process from purchasing raw materials to manufacturing products, it is impossible to obtain financial accommodation. Exporters also have the same predicament, that is, it is not easy to obtain financial accommodation in the intermediate process from purchasing raw materials to manufacturing finished products that can be loaded for export. The new method stipulates that factories need working capital for packaging, transporting to the destination for sales, and exporters need operating funds for purchasing export materials, sorting, refining, or transporting to ports for export. In this way, sound factories and export industries can avoid wasting energy and time on solving financial difficulties, and concentrate on increasing production and exports.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Advantages of the New Method</p>
<p>(6) The new method stipulates that the total amount of the original loan per household shall not exceed: 1. 50 million yuan for discounting, 2. 500 million yuan for pledges, and 3. 1 billion yuan for foreign exchange. The maximum total amount of loan items applied for by the original loan applicant in each syndicate or bank shall not exceed 8% of the bank's deposits. That is, on the one hand, the limit of the loan is relaxed, and on the other hand, restrictions are appropriately added according to the size of each bank's strength.</p>
<p>(7) The new method stipulates that the collateral for the original pledge loan shall be valued at 60% of the value of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products. The remaining 40% may be pledged at 40% of the value of machines and factory buildings after completing notarization procedures. The 40% of the machines and factory buildings that can be pledged is to encourage commercial banks to imitate national banks and promote the use of machines and factory buildings as collateral to solve the difficulties of factories.</p>
<p>(8) The new method stipulates that the original loan interest rate shall not exceed 3.6% per month, and the Central Bank only takes 1.8%. The intention is to gradually reduce the interest rate and allow producers and exporters to get rid of the shackles of usury.</p>
<p>(9) The new method stipulates that if manufacturers have achieved significant results in increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs, they will not be subject to the loan limit. In other words, more loans can be given to enable sound and progressive manufacturers to receive practical encouragement.</p>
<p>President Zhang concluded: Whether the Central Bank can fulfill its mission as a bank for banks, and whether national and commercial banks can fulfill their mission of assisting the country and promoting production, all depends on whether the rediscount policy is sound. We hope that we can work together to establish a new financial system. Furthermore, the relationship between the Central Bank and commercial banks will be changed from a loose state in the past to a close one, laying the foundation for cooperation between public and private financial institutions in the future. Finally, he also said: This rediscount method will be first implemented in Shanghai, and then resolutely promoted to major cities across the country, in order to achieve broad results and assist in the economic recovery of the country.</p>

<h3>Floating Short-Selling of Government Bonds Downstream</h3>
<p>Government bonds yesterday were mostly closed due to profit-taking, triggering floating short-selling. After opening at 14,200 yuan, the unified C bond repeatedly declined. There was a lot of struggle in the middle, and near noon, it finally collapsed, falling to 11,200 yuan before slightly rebounding. As a result, compared with the closing price, A and B bonds each fell by 2,500 yuan, the unified C bond fell by 2,300 yuan, D bonds fell by 2,200 yuan, and the unified E bond also fell by 1,900 yuan. The turnover was more than 10 million yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors of maintaining the credit of unified bonds, and the price was shouted up to 15,000 yuan, but people were divided, and the turnover was not large.</p>
<h3>Mobile Funds Pouring in, Foreign Stocks Rise Smartly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in general, mobile funds poured into foreign stocks. There was a shortage of supply, and major investors from the securities and cloth industries competed to buy again. Ewo Silk started at 25,200 yuan in the early morning and rose to 28,000 yuan. It was once suspended due to the authorities' investigation. In the afternoon, the bulls in the securities industry took profits, and the price fell slightly after rising. As a result, compared with the closing price, British Ewo and Lian Silk each rose by about 45%, and the rest rose by 5% to 10%.</p>
<h3>Central Textiles' Prices Rise Steadily; Coarse and Fine Yarn Equally Popular; Local and External Buyers' Demand Both Improve</h3>
<p>The yarn market has suddenly become strong because Central Textiles has recently been raising yarn prices with each period. Yesterday, the price of 20-count yarn was increased by 80,000, arousing the appetite of various buyers. In addition, the price of yarn in North China was reported to be high. Yesterday, Tianjin merchants actively absorbed "Angel" and "Red Helmet" brands in the market, and other merchants followed suit. As a result, the price of 20-count yarn of various brands rose by 120,000 to 200,000, and 42-count double-strand and 32-count yarn also jumped by 200,000 to 300,000. People's sentiment is high, and the trend is very firm, it is said.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company sold textiles on behalf of the Textile Management Committee as usual, selling a total of 1,903 pieces, including 256 pieces to manufacturers, and 339 pieces of yarn. A total of 1,493 households applied, including 1,155 manufacturers and 338 yarn households.</p>
<h3>Early Thin Rice Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 13,000 piculs of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets, with Southern Japonica rice being the most abundant. Therefore, the price of early thin rice fell sharply by 2,000 yuan across the board, and Northern Japonica rice also fell by more than 1,000 yuan. Indica rice was also reduced by 1,000 yuan. The arrival and sales of white yuan and cloudy yuan were balanced, and there was no increase or decrease for the time being. Flour is trending firmly, foreign flour has risen slightly by 300-500 yuan, domestic flour is stable, and bran has increased slightly by 200-300 yuan. Soybean cake from Shantou continues to arrive, advancing by 1,000 yuan, but the trend is fluctuating and difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>There are not many incoming goods in the oil market, and retail sales are still strong. Soybean oil is very scarce, barrel of unrefined peanut oil increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while barrel of unrefined peanut oil rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Sesame oil is stable, and clear oil is firm.</p>
<p>The source of soybeans from Northeast China has decreased, and there is also a rumor of a ban on exports in a telegram from Hankou. Both peas and soybeans have rebounded by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and broad beans are firmly priced. Mung beans remain at their original price, and red beans are firm. Wheat is stable, corn has risen slightly by 1,000 yuan, and broad beans are showing a firm and stable trend. Raw peanuts are very sluggish in foreign shops, and downstream demand continues. The price has fallen by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, and sesame seeds are ostensibly stable but actually tight.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Wool Textile Association Petition to the Import Management Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Cheng Nianpeng, Chairman of the Wool and Velvet Textile Industry Association of this city, and Secretary Yang Liren, yesterday brought a petition from the association requesting a relaxation of the wool import quota, as well as statistical forms, and visited Director Li Han of the Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee. Director Li was away on official business, and Hu Jiaju, a specialist from the office, met with them instead. Mr. Hu stated that the office had no authority to decide on the relaxation of the quota. He would forward the requests to Director Li. It is now heard that the wool textile industry will also submit petitions to the Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee and the National Economic Commission, requesting a relaxation of the quota. In particular, they plan to request that the quota for wool imports in the next quarter should be relaxed as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Interest on the First Tranche of US Dollar Bonds to Be Calculated Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance has officially ordered the Central Bank to handle the issuance of the first tranche of US dollar treasury bonds, totaling US$200 million, starting today. However, relevant authorities at the Central Bank stated yesterday that they had not yet received any orders from the Ministry of Finance, nor had they received any pre-sale coupons. However, according to a responsible person, the commencement of issuance today actually refers to the technical aspect. That is, today is the date on which interest begins to accrue on the first tranche of bonds. All bonds in the first tranche will accrue interest from today, regardless of the actual date of underwriting, and this is unrelated to whether actual trading will commence today. Furthermore, although the Fund Management Committee has decided to be located in this city, the list of members has not yet been announced. It is said that eleven people have been hired as committee members, including Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Luo Qinghua, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Li Fusun, Shen Rixin, Xu Jibin, and Qin Runqing.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Dye Factories Make Progress</h3>
<p>Tianjin Merchants Search for Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened steadily yesterday. Then, Tianjin merchants searched for "Four Gentlemen" Yuan Biji, pushing the price from 158,000 yuan to 160,000 yuan. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company had not listed prices for two consecutive periods, leading to a positive shift in sentiment. Dye factories for white cloth took advantage of the low prices to absorb stock. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose by 2,000 yuan compared to before the closure, reaching 157,000 yuan. Other cloths such as "Blue Chicken," "Blue Phoenix," "Yang Crane," and "Zhenzhong" also did well, rising from 1,000 to 4,000 or 5,000 yuan. Bleached cloth and coarse cloth sold well and were in good condition. The markets for other aniline dyes and colored cloth were stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Are Consistently Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar industry made progress, and the market situation remained tight. White sugar fluctuated more, with a difference of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Peruvian sand even reached 10,000 yuan. The association set the price for Peruvian fine sand at 237,000 yuan at first, then reduced it slightly by 1,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 242,000 yuan, then to 3,000-4,000-5,000-6,000 yuan, then from 8,000 yuan to 7,500 yuan, and finally to 240,000 yuan, similar to last Saturday. Medium-grain white sugar rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan due to a shortage of goods, and four-and-a-half carts of white Chao goods rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The price of three-and-a-half carts of white sugar barely changed. Taiwan red sugar rose by nearly 10,000 yuan, and local sugar also rose by 4,000-5,000 yuan to 1,000-2,000 yuan. Shantou Qing sugar opened at 144,000-5,000 yuan, Shunde Qing sugar at 140,000 yuan, and Diao Qing sugar at 131,500 yuan to 2,000-3,000 yuan. Xing red sugar was 140,000 yuan for high-quality goods and 134,000-5,000 yuan for ordinary goods. 600-700 pieces were transacted.</p>
<h3>The Bituminous Coal Market Is Even More Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sentiment in the bituminous coal market was weak, and individual households continued to sell off. Small amounts of coal from Fengcheng blocks (Jiangxi), Po Le Tong (Hubei), and Chenshan dregs (Jiangxi) were also transported, leading to a further weakening of the market. The arrival of high-quality white coal blocks was minimal, and the market price remained firm. Low-quality Guibaoqing blocks and Shantou blocks were soft. The charcoal market was also sluggish. Charcoal merchants were promoting sales to robust wholesalers by offering concessions.</p>
<h3>Pre-Qingming New Longjing and Wenzhou Goods May Be the First to Be Offered</h3>
<p>According to fellow merchants, the pre-Qingming new Longjing tea, which is regarded as a treasure by Chinese people, is developing in all production areas as the weather warms. It is said that Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, will be the first to arrive in Shanghai with new tea in a short time. However, it is expected that the selling price will not be low due to the large expenses of all kinds of taxes. As for various types of domestic old tea, the sales of this street and foreign merchants are still scarce. However, those who hold the goods are waiting attitude, so the process continues to support the tea market. The sound of selling is becoming more and more intense, because this year's new tea will soon be on the market, so the holders are very eager to sell the old tea. Unfortunately, the importers are still hesitant, so the market presents a state of oversupply, and the market trend is bleak. Transactions are also in dire straits.</p>
<h3>Fir and Western Pine Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Weak Actual Sales Lead to a Return to Softness in the Market</p>
<p>Recently, the source of local timber has become more abundant. 8 million feet of fir arrived before, and another 3 to 4 million feet have arrived now. There are also many arrivals of Western pine. Due to the tightening of transportation lines, the arrival of Hangzhou timber has decreased compared to before. Actual sales are sluggish, and the market is returning to weakness. Western pine is priced at 3,700 yuan per foot, and five-cent sawn pine planks are priced at 75,000 yuan. The asking price for Hangzhou timber is 300,000 yuan per pair. It is heard that the highest price in Hangzhou is 170,000 to 180,000 yuan, so the price is also entering a weak state. The selling price of large fir logs is 960 yuan per foot, and small logs are 860 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Import Temporary Management Committee Adjusts Its Internal Structure</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Import Management Committee has been formally reorganized by Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Executive Committee, since April 1st, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Li Gan, Director of the Quota Allocation Office, is responsible for the allocation and review of the quota for goods listed in Annex (II). (The first five items in Annex (II) are still subject to review by the Imported Goods Management Office.)</p>
<p>(2) Yu Yingjie, Director of the Non-Quota Import Review Office, is responsible for the review of imports of goods listed in Annex (I) and Annex (III) A.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Imported Goods Management Office, is responsible for the allocation and review of imports of the first five items in Annex (II), and for issuing import permits for all items in Annexes I, II, and III A.</p>
<p>(4) Yang Heng, Director of the Secretariat, is responsible for the registration of import applications and liaison between various departments.</p>
<p>(5) Xu Jiyi, Chairman of the Special Committee, and members Zhang Fuyun, Chen Changtong, Gui Zhongshu, and Yang Heng, are responsible for general appeals and matters relating to changes in the goods listed in the various annexes.</p>
<p>In the future, all applications for import documents can be directly contacted with the relevant departments according to the nature of the goods, so as to avoid the past twists and turns of delivery. However, special application documents from government agencies are handled by the Secretariat.</p>
<h3>Huzhou Wool Rises</h3>
<p>Huzhou wool, the market continued to be strongly sought after yesterday, and the price rose again, to 150,000 yuan per Sima dan. Goat wool also rose to 60,000 yuan per dan. The price of Shandong wool remains at its original level.</p>
<h3>Palys Is Scarce and Expensive; Hot Weather Has Triggered Actual Sales</h3>
<p>Due to the warm weather, actual sales of Palys have been triggered, and merchants from other places are purchasing more actively than those on this street. Palys suits are still quite popular in other places. Due to the lack of stock in the Shanghai market, sales are average, resulting in demand exceeding supply, and prices have generally become firmer. Yesterday, the wholesale price of Grade 1 goods was 160,000 yuan per yard, Grade 2 was 140,000 yuan, Grade 3 was 120,000 yuan, and Grade 4 was 95,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Oil Pressing Industry Hopes That the Authorities Will Supply Soybeans at a Fair Price</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to sources in the oil pressing industry, based on the current market price of 90,000 yuan per dan of soybeans, the net cost of pressing soybean oil is about 400,000 yuan per dan. The current negotiated price of soybean oil is 250,000 yuan per dan, which is far from enough. However, relying solely on adjusting the negotiated price cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Each time the negotiated price is adjusted, the raw materials for oil pressing rise again. As a result, the production cost is not enough again. Therefore, the thorough solution is still to ask the authorities to supply soybeans at a fair price, so as to maintain the production of edible oil. Recently, various private factories have stopped pressing soybean oil due to a shortage of soybeans. However, the source of cottonseed is still sufficient, so the production of oil has not been interrupted.</p>
<h3>The Pharmaceutical Industry Association Sends a Joint Telegram to the Chairman to Pay Respects</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Recently, Chairman Chiang has observed that the pharmaceutical industry is related to national health and the future of national defense. The other day, he personally instructed the competent authorities to provide as much support and facilitation as possible for its revival. The 83 member factories of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city were greatly encouraged upon hearing the news, and specially sent a joint telegram to pay their respects, and also expressed their gratitude to the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Health.</p>
<h3>Daylily Production Price Rises</h3>
<p>The production price of daylily has been rising for days, increasing by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. This trend follows, and the market price was particularly high yesterday, calling for more than 500,000 yuan for high-quality goods, and 410,000 to 420,000 yuan was also needed for ordinary goods.</p>
<h3>Limited Trading After the Holiday; The Chinese Stock Market Is Stable</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market was firmer in the middle of yesterday's trading, due to the news that US dollar bonds were being offered for free subscription and that yarn prices were rising. However, there was limited trading. After some long positions were closed, the market declined slightly again at the end. The market opened strong in the morning due to good sentiment, and Di Yong Yarn Nos. 186, 97, 151, 89, 47, 223, 219, and 179 all advanced. Now, U.S. Asia No. 223 was the first to suspend trading at the limit. The price of Yong Yarn rose to 2,420 yuan. Nos. 97, 106, 235, 218, 36, 199, 226, etc. were sold off and the market declined. Rong Feng rose to the limit at No. 83, but had little impact. Later, Nos. 152 and 32 were sold off, and Yong Yarn once fell to 2,330 yuan. Trading was thin, the situation was peaceful, and it hovered for a long time. After 11:00 a.m., Shanghai US Asia resumed trading at the limit with Nos. 30 and 89, etc. Nos. 89, 223, 36, 156, 47, 106, 105, and 180 were actively bought. Near noon, short positions were suddenly covered, and Yong Yarn rose to above 2,470 yuan. No. 171, etc. offered supply at high prices and slightly declined.

Nos. 171, 117, and 145 were sold to 2,430 yuan. Nos. 89, 231, and 76 are still absorbing. Rong Feng and existing Di US Asia both reported limit up, and there was another struggle.

<p>On the morning of March 25th, as the spring sun shone on the shores of West Lake, a black locomotive slowly pulled a few simple passenger and material cars south from the station building of Chengzhan Huabao. Although those tourists who came to Hangzhou to visit West Lake didn't even look at it, it undoubtedly bears a huge responsibility for the economic value of Southeast China.</p>

<p>Before the Japanese army surrendered, the Jiangbian to Jinhua section, 185 kilometers long, had been repaired and opened to traffic by the Japanese army, and heavy rails were laid to meet their military occupation requirements. Later, the war situation evolved, becoming increasingly unfavorable to the enemy. In the summer of 1945, the Japanese army began to dismantle the tracks, and locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars were gradually transported to the Jinghu and Jinpu lines. By the eve of victory, only the Hangzhou to Zhuji section, 77 kilometers long, remained, with three locomotives, nine passenger cars, and fifty-nine freight cars. After victory, it was ordered to be taken over. At that time, the Hang-Ji section was under the "Central China Railway Management Committee." Under the "Management Committee," the "Hang-Ji Section General Office" was established, and it was received on October 1st. The "Management Committee" was then dissolved on March 1st, and reorganized into the Jinghu District Railway Administration. The "Hang-Ji Section Office" and the Nanxun Section were ordered to be handed over to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for takeover. In April, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau was formally established.</p>
<p>After the Hang-Ji section was taken over, the speed of the trains was very slow due to years of disrepair, averaging only 20 kilometers per hour. Due to the problem of material supply, it could not be improved. The re-railing work on other sections was even more impossible to start. For example, the Japanese army spent only 20 days to lay tracks and open traffic on the 108 kilometers from Zhuji to Jinhua, but we could not start construction due to various difficulties. In the twelve months after the victory, the progress of the repair work was very slow. The Jiangshan to Quzhou section was finally opened to traffic on New Year's Day this year.</p>
<p>Bridge and Culvert Projects Are Repaired First</p>
<p>The most difficult part of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway repair work is the bridge and culvert project, followed by steel rails, sleepers, and funding. For more than a year, many projects have been repeatedly delayed under the predicament of waiting for money and materials, and there is also a little bit of human influence. As for the lack of vehicles, the number is even greater. According to statistics, there are currently only 19 locomotives, 28 passenger cars, and 251 freight cars. It is estimated that 88 locomotives, 131 passenger cars, and 846 freight cars are needed for phased opening to traffic; if the whole line is opened to traffic, 140 locomotives, 296 passenger cars, and 1,250 freight cars are needed.</p>
<p>The slow restoration of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has a significant impact on the livelihood and economy of the entire Southeast region, and it is urgent to re-rail the entire line. In view of this, the central government urgently sought to speed up the repair, and appointed Hou Jiayuan as the director of the Railway Bureau on New Year's Day this year. Mr. Hou is a senior figure in the engineering field. Before the war, he presided over the construction of the Yuping section and made great contributions. Now he is in charge of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway administration, and the expectations of all parties for him are also very high. After Mr. Hou took office, in order to speed up the repair of bridge and culvert projects, he specially divided the large bridges above 100 meters on the entire line into three bridge construction zones. The first bridge construction zone is located in Jinhua, supervising the construction of large bridges such as the Jinhua River, Yishan Port, and Dongyi River between Jinhua and Hengxian; the second bridge construction zone is located in Liangjiadu, supervising the construction of large bridges such as the Shangwan Port, Dengjia Port, and Fuzhou River tributary between Shangrao and Nanchang; the first and third bridge construction zones are located in Zhangshu, supervising the construction of large bridges such as the Shanxi, Shanqian, Ganjiang tributary, and Yuanshan bridges between Nanchang and Pingxiang. The foundation project is scheduled to be completed before the spring flood. On the other hand, six engineering offices were established in Zhuqu, Qurao, Raoxiang, Nanxun, Nanping, and Pingzhu to be responsible for repairing and re-railing projects. At the same time, the transportation undertaking of the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan this year also takes the restoration of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as a major work item; and in order to ensure the responsibility of the work and simplify the procedures, relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Communications, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, and the Provincial Government were invited to form a special committee to be responsible for the storage, transportation, and distribution of materials.</p>
<p>The Progress of the Engineering in Various Sections is Urgent</p>
<p>Among the engineering projects in various sections, the Zhuji-Jinhua section has been completed first. The section is 108 kilometers long. Construction has started day and night since February 1, with a fast speed of 204 to 2.4 kilometers of track laying per day, achieving surprisingly good results. With the concerted efforts of all employees, the track laying was completed on March 17, and the entire section was opened to traffic on the 25th, more than one month ahead of the scheduled opening date, creating a new record for the repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.</p>
<p>As for the progress of other sections of the project, the following is the information: (1) The road art and bridges on the 23-kilometer Jinhua to Lanxi section have been largely repaired. If materials can be supplied, traffic can be opened at the end of this month; (2) The track-laying project on the Nanxun section was previously blocked by the Saihu Bridge, which is 20 kilometers away from Jiujiang. The bridge project is about to be completed, and the Ministry of Communications has set a deadline for restoring traffic by the end of April; (3) The bridge between Shangrao and Nanchang has now started; (4) The survey of Baitang to Pingxiang has also started; and the Pingxiang to Zhuzhou section has started paving, and is expected to open to traffic on the 10th of next month. As long as the Railway Bureau can continue to work with the spirit of building the Zhuji-Jinhua section, the reporter believes that the opening of the entire line is not far away.</p>
<p>Future Plans to Supplement Equipment</p>
<p>In the future plans of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Railway Bureau plans to gradually revive and supplement the equipment of this only transportation artery spanning the southeastern provinces in order to cooperate with the development of the national railway construction and transportation plan, so that it can appear on the Southern Plains with a new look. This is the hope of the Railway Bureau and the hope of the people of Southern China. Currently, the largest project that the Railway Bureau is undertaking is the construction of the Xiaoshan Locomotive Plant. In order to cooperate with locomotive affairs, strengthen transportation efficiency, and seek self-sufficiency in spare parts and accessories, a large locomotive plant with a area of 500 mu and capable of accommodating more than 1,000 workers is planned to be built in Xiaoshan. A plan and budget have been prepared and are ready to be approved before construction begins. As for the machinery and equipment of the locomotive plant, the budget for the first phase is US$6,046,276,000, US$148,789,200 for the second phase, and US$109,840,000 for the third phase. The total number of machines is 165 types, with a tonnage of 122,035 tons. The estimated cost of small tool equipment for the locomotive plant is US$4,401,308. After the completion of the entire plant, the repair capacity will be 54 locomotives, 380 passenger cars, and 1,000 freight cars per year, 500 tons of castings, 200 tons of pigs, and 60 tons of other standard accessories and tools, so as to supply other plants and sections for application. As for the relocation of the locomotive plant during the war, 80 tons of large and small machines were taken away by the Third Branch of the Ordnance Industry Department, and they have now been recovered and transported from Nanping to provide existing temporary machinery and businesses in Xiaoshan for the purpose of manufacturing vehicles and generating electricity.</p>
<p>Few Vehicles are Asked to be Increased</p>
<p>At present, the Hang-Ji section has only three vehicles and three alternative passenger vehicles; now the length of the Hangzhou-Jinhua section is more than doubled. Although merchants have been recruited to build six passenger cars and a part of the freight cars have been approved and allocated, they are still insufficient to cope with the current crowded passenger and freight transportation. Therefore, a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Communications to increase the allocation. As for the lack of locomotives, two locomotives have been rented from the Jinpu Railway at a price of 600,000 yuan per month to solve the temporary needs. If the entire line is opened to traffic, more vehicles will be needed. In March of this year, the Ministry of Communications convened a meeting of directors of railway bureaus from all regions across the country and decided that the Longhai Railway would allocate 56 locomotives and 600 freight cars, but they have not been allocated for a long time. Now, because the three sections of Hangzhou-Jinhua, Nanxun, and Zhupi will start traffic one after another, the demand is urgent, and it has been discussed with the Longhai Railway to transport the vehicles in two phases: (1) via the Jinpu and Jinghu lines to Hangzhou for the use of the Hangzhou-Jinhua section; (2) via the Pinghan line to Hankou to load ships to Jiujiang for the use of the Nanxun section; (3) via the Pinghan and Yuehan lines to Zhuzhou for the use of the Zhupi section. The Ministry of Communications has been asked to transfer the allocation as soon as possible, and the Ministry has first allocated United Nations-bound freight cars to Shanghai, including 10 cars with 40-ton low sides and 4 cars with 20-ton high sides, which have been used in the Hang-Ji section.</p>
<p>Expand Business and Protect Safety</p>
<p>In terms of transportation business, such as planning to restore passenger and freight trains in various sections, it is planned that the Hangzhou-Jinhua section will run five round trips per day, the section will run three round trips, the southern section will run four round trips, and the Ping-Zhu section will run into the decision, and two-class cars will be added to improve the passenger train facilities and add various equipment. It is also planned to increase the allocation of freight cars and restore the responsible transportation of goods to facilitate merchants and protect safety. The business of paying freight, collecting freight prices, sending tickets, and handling bills of lading will also be restored item by item. In order to find a way to attract large cargo transportation, a special price for goods will be set, and the classification table of goods set by the Ministry will be implemented to achieve its rationalization.</p>
<p>The development of railway transportation originally sought to promote the prosperity of industries along the line; and the prosperity of industries depends on the convenience of transportation. The quantity of paper, porcelain, tea, tobacco, salt, rice, fruits, livestock, coal, etc. produced along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and transported to other places every year is very large. The Railway Bureau also plans to maintain close contact with the industrial and commercial circles in various places, such as assisting in improving product packaging, improving manufacturing technology, promoting product sales, transmitting business information from various places, and financing turnover, so as to develop industries along the line. In order to facilitate merchants and travelers in various places, it will cooperate with the transportation offices directly under the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, as well as railways such as Jinghu, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Yuehan to carry out joint passenger and freight transportation. The Hangzhou-Jinhua section is now open to traffic. Personnel have been sent to negotiate the joint transportation between Shanghai and Jiangxi, and it will be realized as soon as the method is decided.</p>
<p>In this way, on the one hand, the implementation of modern railway management can be compared with the railways of other countries, and on the other hand, the combination of north and south railways constitutes a tight transportation network. The value of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is significant. Under the new measures of Director Hou, the full opening of the stack is just around the corner, and how many southeastern compatriots will be cheering for it!</p>
<h3>Taipei Incident Turns Clear After the Rain (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pai Ya</p>
<p>The government having completely accepted the demands of the citizens, this matter should have been peacefully resolved. However, the public continued to make unsystematic proposals, which the government tried its best to adopt. On the 2nd, Director Chen again met with representatives of the people to listen to their opinions and made four additional decisions: (1) Those who participated in this incident will not be prosecuted; (2) Arrested people can be claimed by their parents from the military police; (3) Compensation will be provided for the dead and injured, regardless of whether they are from this province or other provinces; (4) The handling committee will add representatives from all sectors of the people to accommodate the opinions of the majority of the people. Director Chen broadcast to the public at 3 PM on the 2nd, solemnly announcing the above four measures. However, the results were still ineffective. The rioters continued to run rampant, becoming even more extreme. The handling committee added representatives from all sectors of the people, and the hooligans took this opportunity to form large groups. As a result, more and more proposals were made. Originally a local matter due to the suppression of opium, it eventually brewed into political reform.</p>
<p>Fearing No End to Chaos</p>
<p>Speaking of the organization of the February 28th Incident Handling Committee, as the name suggests, its task was only to assist the government in handling this February 28th anti-smuggling incident. However, the purpose of the committee members was not this. They wanted to use this incident to overthrow the Governor-General's Office and change it to a provincial government, and demand that positions of director be filled by people from this province. The intention of Sima Zhao is obvious to everyone. Because of their ill motives, they not only failed to dissuade the hooligans who were killing and setting fires, and the emotionally charged people who lacked reason and echoed them, from quickly restoring social order, but even occupied the broadcasting station, openly inciting the public to rebel, fearing no end to the chaos, in order to achieve their ulterior motives.</p>
<p>The Sharpness of Ambitious People</p>
<p>In addition to a small number of committee members who were sent by the government to participate in the organization, most of the rest were so-called people's representatives. These so-called people's representatives were mostly people with no national concept, who did not understand national laws, who were parochial, and blindly followed others. They occupied the broadcasting station all day long, arbitrarily expressed their opinions, stirred up unrest, formed illegal organizations, and used alarming words to confuse the public. They even praised the hooligans who specialized in killing unarmed people from other provinces, and who were killed, as revolutionary martyrs. This is truly the greatest joke in the world, and a clear sign of betraying the country. However, in order to achieve a peaceful solution, the government did not want bloodshed to occur, and explained the greater good, and reluctantly accepted their demands. It also strictly ordered the police and military police not to fire on the rioting people. Therefore, after the incident, many police officers had their firearms confiscated by the hooligans, and were beaten and injured or killed. Who knew that they not only could not understand the government's difficulties, but became even more extreme. The opium suppression case originally only occurred in one corner of Taipei City, but they took the opportunity to notify all 17 counties and cities in the province to establish February 28th handling committees, planting their own party members everywhere, and echoing each other from afar. Their intentions can be imagined. As the organization gradually grew larger, their rebellious hearts became more and more determined, and their demands became even harsher and more unreasonable. For example, demanding the disarming of the military police and the abolition of the Garrison General Headquarters, and demanding that the National Army surrender its weapons, were all treasonous intentions. They also organized a loyal and righteous service team, whose members were mostly hooligans, responsible for maintaining local security. At the same time, students from Mt. Ali Middle School also organized a so-called autonomous youth alliance, expressing their opinions and participating in maintaining security, occupying institutions everywhere, calling it taking over. Even students in their teens participated in the actions. Such absurdity is truly an unprecedented wonder.</p>
<p>The first institutions to be taken over were those in Taichung City. The only power plant in the province and the Railway Committee were also occupied and controlled by them. All public officials from other provinces in Taichung City were concentrated in the former Japanese concentration camp, given a bowl of sour rice a day, and arbitrarily insulted, glorifying it as protection. Taipei City's Da Ming Bao newspaper published a sensational article, reporting that the price of rice fell after the people from other provinces were concentrated. They used large headlines to gloat over this unreasonable behavior. Let's calm down and think about it. There were only a few hundred public officials from other provinces in Taichung City. Before they were concentrated, the so-called rice consumption was extremely small. How could they be the main reason for the rise in rice prices? Moreover, Taichung is the most abundant grain-producing area in Taiwan. In fact, this time, all parts of the country were affected by the economic impact of Beijing and Shanghai, and prices rose endlessly. To prevent this phenomenon, the authorities in Jiangsu Province took emergency measures, prohibiting the trading of gold and registering grain. These landlords and capitalists, seeing that they could not manipulate the situation to make illegal fortunes, were unwilling in their hearts. Therefore, they used the February 28th opium suppression incident as an excuse to instigate a group of hooligans who had always been supported by them to create trouble and cause chaos. The treacherous party also took advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in inciting discord, resulting in this act of betraying the country. It is heartbreaking to talk about!</p>
<p>Since the February 28th incident in Taipei occurred, the storm spread from the 1st and 2nd to Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south, with huge waves and storms rising in every corner of the province. Although the government made many concessions, it still could not satisfy their desires. For a time, it almost fell into a state of anarchy. Trains stopped running, ships stopped sailing, postal services were interrupted, shops were deserted, institutions were closed, etc. The losses to the public and private sectors, and the suffering of the people, were countless.</p>
<p>Selling Dog Meat While Hanging Up a Sheep's Head</p>
<p>The organization of this handling committee was fundamentally a gathering of foxes and dogs. It was called demanding political reform, but in fact, they all wanted to compete for official positions, demanding that county and city officials be elected by the people, and that all senior and junior personnel should be from this province. If it was necessary to use people from other provinces, it should be approved by the handling committee. Director Chen, believing that they were sincere in participating in the reform of the province's politics, agreed to change the Governor-General's Office to a provincial government, and to use as many people from this province as possible for the positions of director of each department. He also notified them to submit a list so that they could be recommended to the central government. Each county and city put forward three candidates for county and city mayor so that they could be selected. However, internal strife broke out at this point. They all wanted to seize the opportunity to have their names listed on the list. However, there were few official positions, and many people wanted to become officials. There were too many monks and not enough porridge, and it was fundamentally difficult to distribute. As a result, everyone began to attack each other. Flyers attacking Chiang Wei-chuan, Lu Bo-xiong, etc., flew all over the streets. Those who were attacked had spent a great deal of effort to create this incident, so how could they be defeated? As a result, everyone began to conspire against each other and submit opinions to the Governor-General's Office, hoping to be registered. The true political reform, the suffering of the people, and the aftermath of the opium suppression case that should have been discussed, had been thrown to the winds. Were they patriots or traitors? This is clearly visible.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, the government sincerely accepted the demands of the people, adopting everything within the legal scope. However, these unreasonable and ambitious people were hypocritical. On the one hand, they still instigated hooligans to loot warehouses and attack military institutions everywhere. They were deeply incited by traitors and were completely unaware. They regarded the government's leniency as incompetence. In Taichung and Tainan, they disarmed the government's weapons, took them away, and slaughtered domestic compatriots, recklessly doing whatever they wanted! The bad habits left by Japanese fascism still existed!</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang and Director Chen believed that Taiwan had been separated from the motherland for more than 50 years, and had suffered greatly from the ravages of Japanese invaders. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was returned to the motherland, and leniency was shown everywhere. Regarding the occurrence of this incident, Chairman Chiang clearly stated during the Central Memorial Week, and Director Chen also broadcast three times to the people, declaring the government's attitude. The Supervisory Yuan also sent Yang Liang-gong, the supervisory envoy of Min and Taiwan, to Taiwan to investigate. Based on this, if they were truly demanding political reform, they should have made requests to the authorities in a legal and reasonable manner, and the government would have accepted them.</p>
<p>Forced to Sing Japanese Songs</p>
<p>Who knew that these ambitious people incited a large number of hooligans to attack the Keelung Fortress Headquarters and the Taipei Garrison General Headquarters at 11 PM on the 8th, attempting to occupy them. The sound of gunfire that night was like a string of firecrackers, rarely interrupted. It was said that the number of traitors was very large, hoping to take them down in one fell swoop. That night, in the cold wind and heavy rain, everyone had been living in uncertainty for several days. Suddenly hearing the fierce gunfire, they were all frightened, their faces showing the color of death. This shows the intensity of the hooligans' attack that night, and the fact that they were betraying the country was even more obvious. The Governor-General's Office and the Garrison General Headquarters, seeing that these ambitious people were so stubborn and had no sincerity in reforming the government, and that they were carrying out their rebellion, imposed martial law on the 9th in order to maintain local order and protect the good people. When the storm reached Taichung, the area was also full of hooligans. Under the call of ambitious people, they swarmed up and attacked warehouses, confiscated weapons from the military police, and insulted people from other provinces. The heads of all institutions (people from other provinces) and public school teachers from other provinces were all concentrated and monitored, losing their freedom. Among them were men, women, old and young, who were forced to sing Japanese national songs. However, some small business owners bribed them with money and were recognized as "good citizens." After issuing a "good citizen certificate" written in Japanese, they were released. Isn't this a strange thing! Huang Shi, the design section chief of the Kaohsiung Port Bureau, was detained in the so-called concentration camp after taking a train south to Taichung on official business. He took the opportunity to escape. This is what Huang Shi experienced firsthand.</p>
<p>Xie E's Righteousness is Inspiring</p>
<p>When the province was in extreme chaos and the public was in turmoil, Ms. Xie E, a representative of the National Assembly of Taiwan Province, tried to persuade them not to go beyond the norm and to act rationally. Not only did she fail, but she was also beaten and insulted by rioters, and her personal property, equipment, and medicines (Ms. Xie's hospital) were completely destroyed. Although Ms. Xie knew that under the collusion of ambitious people and local hooligans, the situation was out of control, she stood up to stop them out of righteous indignation for the country and the nation, unafraid of violence. Her spirit and courage are truly a disgrace to men. On the other hand, there were many representatives of the National Assembly, councilors, provincial and county councilors, and self-proclaimed social elites whose status and reputation were no less than Ms. Xie's. They all wanted to fish in troubled waters, push the boat along, and do everything to get the flower. They occupied the radio station, spoke loudly, incited the public, printed Japanese extra editions, and incited the hearts of the people, hoping to emerge as leaders. This is truly "Ah Q's rebellion," with nothing to add.</p>
<p>High-Ranking Officials and Large Armies Arrive</p>
<p>After the central government received the report of the turmoil in Taiwan Province, the Supervisory Yuan immediately ordered Yang Liang-gong, the supervisory envoy of Min and Taiwan, to come to Taiwan to investigate and comfort the people. Supervisor Yang took a warship from Fuzhou to Taiwan and arrived in Keelung on the 8th. The handling committee used the excuse of welcoming him and led a large number of people to greet him, with ulterior motives. At that time, Supervisor Yang's motorcade consisted of several cars, led by military police and attendants. He himself was in the last car. On the way, the car was intercepted and attacked by traitors. Some of the attendants were injured. Fortunately, the military police provided strong protection and he was able to escape. Their poisonous intentions, attempting to assassinate high-ranking officials and betray the country, are beyond reproach!</p>
<p>According to reports from the central government, the priority was to attack military institutions, attempting to disarm them and openly carry out actions to betray the country. This was no longer an ordinary legal political demand. Therefore, the 21st Division of the Army was sent to Taiwan to maintain security, stabilize social order, and protect the good people. It arrived safely in Keelung on the 9th, landed and stationed in Taipei City, and then advanced to various counties and cities.</p>
<p>The so-called February 28th Incident Handling Committee, which was illegally organized, was now deserted. Knowing that their actions were wrong and would be punished by the country, they all fled. The hooligans scattered. The young students who occupied the police stations and the illegal takeover committees of various institutions also fled. Everything was deserted, and no one dared to be as arrogant and showy as they had been a few days ago. It is true that evil cannot prevail over good. In an instant, the atmosphere that had permeated the entire island of Taiwan for several days gradually dissipated, and the sun shone again.</p>
<p>Since the 9th, after the national army successively entered the counties and cities, illegal groups were resolutely disbanded, traitors and criminals were eliminated, and the good people were comforted. All order was immediately restored to normal. All institutions resumed normal operations. The chimneys of various factories and fields also began to smoke again. The people from other provinces who had been concentrated in Taichung City also regained their freedom. All sectors in Taitung County sent a telegram to the province to retain County Magistrate Xie Zhen to continue his term. All sectors in Taichung City sent a telegram to the provincial government to retain Mayor Huang Keli. The Hsinchu City Council sent a telegram to Director Chen to pay their respects and sent personnel to Taipei to welcome County Magistrate Zhu Wenbo back to his post. The Penghu County Council also sent a telegram to Director Chen to pay their respects and report on the situation in the county. All counties and cities reported that order had been restored, trains were running north and south without obstruction, prices were gradually falling, ships to and from the south and north began to sail, and everything returned to its former state. However, in order to thoroughly eliminate traitors and criminals, the authorities will conduct a census in order to protect the good people. For more than ten days, the 6 million people of the province were shrouded in gloom, barely able to breathe. After the 9th, everything returned to normal. Order was restored, the streets were lively, shops were open, and pedestrians were crowded, all showing joy. It was also a great spring day, the weather was clear, and the peach and plum trees were competing for beauty, presenting a picture of prosperity. Finally, we hope that all compatriots in Taiwan, after this painful experience, will thoroughly understand the country and the nation, and work with the government to build our beautiful Taiwan into a model province! Be alert! Fellow Taiwanese!</p>

<p>Reply to Mr. Bu Zaitisheng: Regarding your letter asking about the standard of secondary education fees in Jiangsu Province, we have recently received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education stating: "The regulations for the collection of student fees by provincial, county, city, and private secondary schools in this province for the 36th year have long been submitted to and approved by the 77th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. Subsequently, the Provincial Boy Scouts Council sent a letter requesting that primary secondary schools increase the collection of 3,000 yuan for Boy Scout activity equipment fees, which was also approved by the 84th meeting of the Government Committee, and orders were issued separately for compliance. We are now sending a copy of the fee collection regulations for provincial, county, city, and private secondary schools for your reference." The three copies of the regulations sent are very long, and this column is limited in space and cannot be published in full. Since you have been notified that orders have been issued, please consult the educational institutions nearby for information.</p>

<h3>Getting Together - Continuing the Dream of Yangzhou XIII</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>In the article "Tea Gathering," the author mentioned the demeanor of some old tea drinkers in Yangzhou tea houses in the past. In addition to these tea drinkers, there were of course many others who, although not regardless of heat and cold, and not regardless of sunny or rainy days, were sure to go to the tea house every day, but if they had free time, they always enjoyed spending a few hours there. According to Yangzhou customs, sending invitations, inviting guests, sitting in restaurants, clinking glasses, and using this as a way to get together to reminisce about the old days, etc., were not very popular. But they especially liked inviting people to tea gatherings. When they met relatives and friends they had not seen for a long time, after exchanging greetings, they would invite each other to tea gatherings without exception. Even if they met often, they would invite each other to tea gatherings from time to time. This is called "getting together" by Yangzhou people. The so-called "getting together" means a tea gathering. The sound of "getting together" was very easy to hear in the past in Yangzhou, in various social occasions and even in front of alleyways.</p>
<p>Getting together can be said to be a very popular and common way for Yangzhou people to socialize. Most of them were oral agreements, rarely written notes, and even less formal invitations. In terms of procedure, it was very simple. In terms of cost, it was very economical. Moreover, in these gatherings, no one had the intention of returning the favor, and no one calculated how many times each other had acted as the host, probably because it didn't cost much!</p>
<p>Moreover, these gatherings were really too pleasant in the past. The tea house allowed people to eat snacks and temporarily not pay, but to be recorded on their own account. If you wanted to drink alcohol and needed to order additional wine and food, the tea house could handle it on your behalf, and you could also temporarily not pay, and have it all recorded on your account. Also, if you came by rickshaw, the tea house could also pay the rickshaw fare on your behalf, and record it on your account as well. So everyone could gather without bringing a penny. This was because whoever liked to go to a certain tea house was a customer of that tea house. If a customer had an account, it could attract more business. In the past, price fluctuations were very small, and the tea house owner didn't care about cash transactions. Moreover, cash transactions were mostly passers-by or people who didn't often go to the tea house. Ancient Yangzhou had long lost its former prosperity, so how could the tea house business flourish without relying on these customers? Everything was recorded on account, which provided convenience for the customers. The tea customers who recorded on account were the people most sincerely welcomed by the tea house owner. Thus, A opened an account in a certain tea house and got together with B. When it came time to settle the bill, the waiters could understand the owner's intentions and absolutely follow A's instructions, take out the nth volume of the account book, and let A personally write down the amount owed that day. Even if B took out banknotes and snatched to be the host, or even scolded the waiter to be the host, it would be ineffective. Even for the author, although I was born in Yangzhou, I spent more time outside. In the past, whenever I returned home on vacation, because it was difficult to be the host, I would temporarily open an account in one or two tea houses. This way, we could both record on account, and whoever was sharp-eyed and quick-handed to get the account book could be the host.</p>
<p>In addition, a certain tea house was the place where a certain group of people often gathered. Going there often would inevitably result in meeting many like-minded friends. Therefore, people who had been away from home for a long time would always go to the tea house to move around after returning home. There, they could meet the people they wanted to meet, and they would no longer have to visit each other one by one. Therefore, in the past, when I returned home in the morning, I would definitely go to the tea house in the afternoon. When I returned home in the afternoon, I would definitely go to the tea house the next morning. When I went, the waiter would tell me that someone was here, or that someone had already left, and would also tell others on my behalf that I had returned, or that I had come. The waiter had a mental account of who belonged to which group, and whose whereabouts had to be told to whom. Going there was much more useful than placing an advertisement in the newspaper. Moreover, since friends were gathered there, you could talk to Zhang, and then talk to Li. There were many people and many words, and you could handle things with ease. This was much more enjoyable than visiting each other one by one!</p>
<p>However, there were some differences in meaning between getting together in the morning and getting together in the afternoon. Because there were more people coming and going in the tea house in the morning, it was always noisy. The afternoon was relatively quiet. Therefore, the morning focused on eating snacks, while the afternoon focused on chatting.</p>
<h3>The Night of High Winds and Dark Moon</h3>
<p>— Wang Yide</p>
<p>Under the sharp wind, the moonlight was like smoke and gauze, the reeds in the wilderness rustling and shaking.</p>
<p>In the hazy night, a whistle swept past, piercing the lonely sky with a mournful sound; from the dark depths of a bramble bush, a dark figure leaped out, dressed entirely in black.</p>
<p>He turned his face towards the distance, pursed his lips, and made a circle with his fingers at his mouth; hee-lee-lee – he let out a sharp cry, and immediately the echo reverberated throughout the fields.</p>
<p>"Hey! Is everyone here yet?" The dark figure raised his voice and spoke into the wind, then raised his hand to shade his eyes, peering into the darkness.</p>
<p>"We're all here, just waiting for your word, Little Mao!" A voice replied from the front, hoarse, almost like a duck calling for spring.</p>
<p>"Alright, lads! Let's take a count—" the black-clad figure spoke again towards the front.</p>
<p>"Four, four people—Zhang Mazi, Zhao Laoda, Xiao Niu, Liu Quezi." A string of names was carried over from the wind; the voice was still the same hoarse one.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's everyone! Including yours truly, Little Mao, that makes exactly five. Tonight, we'll pick the one belonging to the Five Families Ancestor, west of the bridge—the newly built one. Do you lads understand?"</p>
<p>The five people moved silently in the darkness, their footsteps very light, not making a sound. If anyone happened to cough, it would immediately shatter the surrounding quiet.</p>
<p>The sharp wind swept past in the high sky.</p>
<p>——"Tomb of Mr. Wang Gong Liuquan"—— The green stone tablet stood in the night wind, like a dozing giant; taller than in the daytime, more mysterious than in the daytime.</p>
<p>The five people looked up and scrutinized it, running their palms over the inscriptions.</p>
<p>"That's it! Bring the tinder," someone suddenly spoke in the darkness, and the others silently obeyed his orders; in this kind of situation, words were few, and what was said was easily effective.</p>
<p>"Eagle's beak pickaxe," another hoarse voice asked someone for the tool to break the earth, and the person next to him silently passed it to him in the same way.</p>
<p>The tinder lit up briefly, and the mouth of the pickaxe plunged into the soil; and so, a muffled sound began to emanate from behind the tomb, and suddenly it was easy to believe that it came from the depths of the earth.</p>
<p>After a while, there was a scraping sound, which was the shovel removing the yellow earth. This sound seemed very crisp, and the sharp wind immediately carried it away.</p>
<p>After a long time, the soil had been dug into a huge hole, revealing the stone slabs buried inside.</p>
<p>"Iron crowbar, bring the iron crowbar! Let me test the position of the stone slab!"</p>
<p>The speaker took the iron crowbar and inserted it, using force to loosen the soil on the stone slab.</p>
<p>The heavy stone slab moved, and several people used knives to pry it off; they were covered in sweat, but when they put it down, they did so gently, afraid of crushing someone's foot.</p>
<p>The coffin was embedded in the stone vault, with its glossy, black lid exposed.</p>
<p>"Time to open the treasure chest, lads, stand firm!"</p>
<p>Everyone stuffed mugwort leaves tightly into their nostrils and rinsed their mouths with liquor; they rubbed their hands, feeling both frightened and excited.</p>
<p>Thump! Thump! The one who carried the axe began to chop at the coffin lid; each strike made the coffin emit a hollow cry.</p>
<p>Gradually, a crack appeared along its edge, not wide but very deep. The iron crowbar was inserted all the way in, one end pressed down by manpower, and the other end acting as a lever.</p>
<p>"Apply force!" The hoarse voice shouted, and the wood creaked.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if giving no time to prepare, there was a thunderous sound out of nowhere; the coffin lid separated from the coffin, tilting unevenly.</p>
<p>Two people walked to either end, struggling to lift it and put it aside.</p>
<p>People's expressions were tense, reaching their peak!</p>
<p>The "wind lantern" was lit, illuminating the edge of the coffin; a piece of rag was used to cover the face of the deceased—it was a habit, those who stripped the corpses never allowed themselves to see the faces of the dead; it was said that people had died of fright if they didn't do this.</p>
<p>"Your Lordship, please listen to a word: We five youngsters are driven by poverty; there is no way to Heaven, no door to Hell, we are forced to take risks, but we fear our strength is not enough. After much thought, we have no choice but to offend Your Lordship and borrow a little. Tomorrow, we will burn incense, kowtow, admit our guilt, and express our gratitude..." The black-clad figure muttered, and after finishing, he knelt down and kowtowed. But as soon as he stood up, the people around him immediately gathered around, their eyes like flickering will-o'-the-wisps.</p>
<p>A chaotic search, a chaotic search! Hands were wet and slippery, and the stench of decaying flesh filled the air.</p>
<p>The clothes of the dead were stripped off, the colors mottled and terrifying.</p>
<p>They felt around the corpse, searching for any unexpected valuables.</p>
<p>"Hey! What's this?" Someone found a hard object, heavy but not shiny.</p>
<p>"Jade!" The black-clad figure coldly glanced at it and called out the name.</p>
<p>With skillful movements, the corpse was searched from head to toe, and everything that could be turned into money was taken away!</p>
<p>The wild wind swept past, and the "wind lantern" sputtered.</p>
<p>Suddenly someone reported the time! "The Big Dipper is slanting, dawn is near!"</p>
<p>"Lads! Let's call it a day, leave something for His Lordship himself!" Someone said again.</p>
<p>With a whistle, the "wind lantern" was extinguished, and the five figures began to move. Leaving the corpse in the tomb staring blankly at the sky.</p>
<p>"Heh heh, another full haul!" The hoarse voice sounded like a duck calling.</p>
<p>Under the sharp wind, the moonlight was like smoke and gauze, the reeds in the wilderness rustling and shaking.</p>
<h3>Test</h3>

<p>How do you strike a match?...How do you look at your fingernails?...When asked to look at a corner of the room, how do you look?...How do you drink a glass of water?</p>
<p>Try it out with yourself and your friends to see if these can test whether you are male or female.</p>
<p>A woman strikes a match outwards? A man strikes it towards himself.</p>
<p>When a woman looks at her fingernails, she looks at the entire hand; a man bends his finger and only looks at the nail.</p>
<p>When a woman looks at a corner of the room, she always scans the entire room first; a man looks directly at the corner.</p>

<h3>The Suicide of Lion and the Life of an Artist</h3>
<p>— Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>It's funny to die when you weren't born at the right time</p>
<p>Lion has committed suicide!</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance first started, Lion didn't die in the Shanghai Real People's Theater, didn't die imprisoned in Nanjing after being falsely accused, didn't die in the whirlpool of Huang Qiuyue, didn't die in the Battle of Northern Hunan when he fell off his horse on a cliff edge, didn't die behind enemy lines in a commando unit, didn't die when Guilin fell, in the raging fire of the Jincheng River, didn't die on the Dushan Road beneath the precipice, didn't die in a plane crash between Chongqing and Kunming, didn't die watching the front lines in the severe cold of the Northeast, but quietly, upon returning to Shanghai today, he actually chose suicide?</p>
<p>How can I bear to see Lion, active in the arts, soaring on the battlefield, enthusiastic about his career, end his life with such despair? But the evidence, both human and material, gives me only ironclad facts. Last night at six o'clock, I invited Lion to accompany a friend to a small literary and artistic gathering for dinner. Apart from me, no one arrived at seven-thirty. Urgent telegrams flooded in, from the arts community, newspaper offices, and various locations, but no one knew of his whereabouts. Then, a member of his household sent a note, urging me to rush to Ward 308 of the × Ji Hospital to visit a patient in critical condition, and to apply for an emergency loan on his behalf. I still cannot believe that it was Lion. The hospital also did not know who he was. They only found my name card and a suicide note in his pocket, which the director recognized, so he telephoned his home to inform them. Is it real? Is it an illusion?</p>
<p>Lion is certainly a good drinker, and always gets drunk when he drinks, but he can still ride his bicycle home alone. Now, why would he abandon his bicycle by the Baidu Bridge, and throw himself into the water, his clothes soaked through? Fortunately, he was blocked by wooden piles under the bridge, stopping a tram, and causing the ticket collector to cry for help. Boatmen gathered and got him to the Erbai Bo Wharf, where he was admitted to the × Ji Hospital and placed on a stretcher. Blood splattered on his leather jacket, and he remained unconscious for several hours without coming back to life.</p>
<p>His suicide note was only a hundred words long. The first section said: "Modern cultural figures cannot survive. They dare not take a bold risk, yet they are unwilling to change their principles halfway, so they become pessimistic and commit suicide..." Then there was a little poem:</p>
<p>"Rembrandt 'Saintly devotion to books,'</p>
<p>Xu Zhimo 'Quietly departed!'</p>
<p>If Qu's 'The moon also carries tearful traces of light,'</p>
<p>Xiao Jian is 'Entrusted to painting, unbearable to depict,'</p>
<p>Zhang Ziyi only leaves behind beautiful lines,</p>
<p>Ai Xia and Ying Yin are already forgotten!</p>
<p>I myself will always be like a fish trying to steal away on the water!</p>
<p>A beast running in the forest.</p>
<p>Failing to paint a tiger, a fish making trouble,</p>
<p>Born at the wrong time, dying is also funny!"</p>
<p>The familiar Lion, inevitably like Rembrandt, full of resentment towards the world, also inevitably devoted to love, like Qu and Xiao Jian, how could they not be? Zhimo was even more so! Only enjoying life is something that artists cannot avoid, and those who do not understand will think that he is being hypocritical, and so he had to say such pathetic words of self-deprecation!</p>
<p>Alas, Lion is still in critical condition, unable to confide his secrets to his close friends. The situation is urgent. Apart from cabling Qian Mei in Changsha; I sincerely pray that Lion will not die after the emergency treatment! However, the old friend I am watching over has a face as white as paper, and is breathing weakly. I shudder as I write this record, and cannot help but shed tears! (1947, March, 30th, 12 midnight)</p>
<h3>Still Life</h3>
<p>— Cézanne</p>
<p>Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) was not only a major figure of Post-Impressionism, but also the greatest painter produced in the nineteenth century. He never attended art school, nor did he study under a teacher, but achieved great success through his own dedicated research. However, he was greatly influenced by Impressionism. His works not only focused on the analysis of light, but also on a profound study of the "quality" and "quantity" of objects. It can be said that no modern famous painter has not been directly or indirectly influenced by him, so he has become the watershed between modern and contemporary art. Historians revere him as the "Father of Modern Painting." (Lion)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 300</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This reason was very convincing to himself. But there was another, more sufficient reason; this, perhaps, was the most reliable explanation of all the above reasons: for example, the youth had been caught by him, or had stopped when greeted. However, since he had come with a plan, could his answer to your questions really satisfy you? In other words, even if you sent him to the military headquarters, would he be willing to tell the truth?</p>
<p>Tsurumi Tensei was somewhat stubborn, and very young, so of course he had a kind of inexplicable arrogance, which was normal; at that time, he did not take the youth's actions seriously, he believed that he had the ability to get to the bottom of the matter, and did not need the violent reactions of ordinary people when dealing with events.</p>
<p>But how should this "0915" be explained after all?</p>
<p>This number made him think of all the codes of intelligence: old-fashioned, new-fashioned, ones that he had spent a lot of effort creating himself, but he couldn't think of any connection. It was a mysterious thing. The number was only four digits, very simple, but the more he thought about it, the more his mind was filled with it. Every little nerve was tied with a piece of paper, and on each piece of paper, there was such a simple "0915."</p>
<p>The sound of knocking on the door startled him. Tsurumi realized that he had dozed off; the piece of paper, which he had been holding in his hand, had now fallen to the ground. He flipped his wrist and saw that it was already twenty past ten.</p>
<p>"Huh!" Tsurumi was a little surprised, surprised that Pingzi hadn't come to wake him up earlier. Maybe he had slept too soundly, and Pingzi had already come?</p>
<p>"Please come in!" His vocal cords were relaxed, somewhat hoarse; a sign of being too tired.</p>
<p>Tsurumi thought that when Pingzi came in, she would laugh at him, saying, "In the end, men are not as durable as women." But when the door opened, it was not Pingzi who came in, but the maid from the inn. The impression of this maid had left a faint, peculiar shadow in Tsurumi's mind when he first entered Wansui Hall. He hadn't analyzed it carefully, he only felt that this maid was a little peculiar. Perhaps he had asked Pingzi to have this maid wake him up because he intentionally wanted to observe her actions more.</p>
<p>"Master Tsurumi!" The maid bowed, with a maiden's shyness. She didn't seem like an old hand; "A guest has arrived, he has been waiting for a long time..." She was also holding a formal-looking envelope in her hand, and respectfully handed it to Tsurumi.</p>
<p>"Oh," Tsurumi seemed surprised to hear that there was a guest, "Where is Miss Pingzi?"</p>
<p>"Miss went out at eight o'clock and has not returned... When she left, she instructed the guest to come back at twenty past ten. Now the guest has come back a second time and insists on seeing you, Master!"</p>
<p>Tsurumi looked at the envelope, which was printed with the words "Consulate General of Great Japan in Shanghai," etc., but the recipient was "Nakamura Pingzi." He felt the envelope with his fingers and sensed that there seemed to be a smaller envelope inside.</p>
<p>"What kind of guest is it? Please ask him to come in..."</p>
<p>"It is a young soldier, he said he is your subordinate..."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see... Quickly, ask him to come in!" Tsurumi waved his hand repeatedly.</p>

<h3>Casual Chats from Solitary Mooring</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>People with lung disease are afraid of hearing others mention lung disease.</p>
<p>Old maids are jealous of lively and beautiful young women, and are annoyed by titles such as "Madam" and "Young Mistress." They often hope that others also lack the good fortune they do not have.</p>
<p>They are very generous in wishing to give pain to others. They deliberately get close to other people's mouths when they have lung disease and are speaking; they deliberately misuse bowls, chopsticks, and teacups.</p>
<p>Drowned ghosts forget the cause of their drowning, and do not sympathize with the pain of others. They are only planning to find a "replacement" every day.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "People must first insult themselves, and then others will insult them; families must first destroy themselves, and then others will destroy them; states must first attack themselves, and then others will attack them."</p>
<p>He also said: "The reason why Jie and Zhou lost the world was because they lost the people." I am willing to solemnly copy these old sayings and hang them in the halls of power, as a mirror for all ages.</p>
<p>A friend told me that this story happened in Annam.</p>
<p>A Chinese man and a French man, both speaking French, argued over a small matter. In the end, they both cursed each other.</p>
<p>The Chinese man was furious and began to curse in his native Chinese dialect: "Your mother's ×, × your mother's ×..."</p>
<p>The French man stared blankly for a while, unable to understand what the other was saying. After another Chinese man translated it, he suddenly understood and couldn't help but burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"That is my mother's problem, you can deal with her directly. Try to get her consent, this is not a curse..."</p>
<p>If this story is true, it can be used to understand the different views of China and France on honor and shame.</p>
<p>Only people who share the same rational concepts can have dignity. Many religions have their own different worship rituals. These behaviors cannot be pondered in detail.</p>
<p>Try to take a king, strip him naked, and exile him to a deserted island. I think his sense of dignity will be removed at the same time as his clothes.</p>
<h3>Every Day is April Fool's Day</h3>
<p>— Old Farmer</p>
<p>Any nation that lacks a sense of humor and does not understand integrity, the best thing to do is not to talk about April Fool's Day. Such a nation can only follow the old examples: Lantern Festival with lights, Qingming outing, Dragon Boat Festival races, Qixi begging for skill, Mid-Autumn Festival moon appreciation, Double Ninth climbing, Laba porridge, Twenty-third sending off the stove god, etc., to ensure a safe passage through life without any accidents. Adding an April Fool's Day is absolutely impossible, and also unnecessary!</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>April Fool's Day, I must first warn you: it is a day of cunning. You see, on this day, Westerners can make jokes and have fun, and use rumors to confuse the public. Therefore, it doesn't matter if you publish in the newspaper that Stalin has died in Moscow, or tell everyone that Truman has suffered a stroke in the White House, others will not say that you are spreading rumors or call you crazy. If you were in China, you would very likely be dragged into the police station, court, or prison. To avoid trouble, please keep your mouth shut, so that you can safely get through April Fool's Day!</p>
<p>To be honest, April Fool's Day is only applicable to the West, and 100% incompatible with the national conditions of China. Empty promises and bouncing checks are considered everyday occurrences in China. Adding another April Fool's Day would only increase the opportunities for spreading rumors and fraud. In other words, every day is April Fool's Day, so what's the need to specially designate one day as April Fool's Day? Is it necessary to legalize spreading rumors, cunning, and deceit? Is it that a face full of Confucian virtues, a stomach full of benevolence and morality, but in reality, a large group of male thieves and female prostitutes, spreading rumors and acting cunningly, is still not thorough enough?</p>
<p>I am not against April Fool's Day. April Fool's Day has an undeniable side. Originally, integrity is important in life, morality is essential, and humor is also necessary. Of course, loyalty is allowed, and deception is not, but year-round integrity and all-day loyalty are too serious, perhaps even too rigid. Among the three hundred and sixty-five days, setting aside twenty-four hours to make harmless jokes and create unimportant rumors is very free, without the constraints of ethics, with a fresh sense of humor, and from this, you can truly experience how much the virtues of integrity, morality, and loyalty are worth cherishing.</p>
<p>My conclusion is: In China, April Fool's Day should be renamed "Integrity Day." If anyone deliberately violates this, "they will be killed without discussion."</p>
<h3>April Fool's Day</h3>
<p>— Er Bi</p>
<p>It's April 1st again. April 1st is "April Fool's Day." As usual, newspapers in various countries will fabricate a few sensational news stories, and social circles will inevitably spread some unfounded gossip, doing their best to make people half-believe and half-doubt. When things become almost a real situation, they will suddenly reveal the truth: "Today is April 1st!" Everyone laughs it off.</p>
<p>Some people also call this day "Telling Lies Day." On this day, telling lies seems to be something that no one has to take responsibility for.</p>
<p>But, apart from this one day of "telling lies," are we always telling the truth at other times?</p>
<p>From international negotiations to relationships between friends, how many people dare to be honest with each other at all times, and never tell lies? Anyone who believes that there is still such a thing as "morality" in the international arena is also naive to the extreme—so naive that they will probably never understand international news in their lifetime.</p>
<p>What about personal interactions? The so-called "getting along" in society, the so-called understanding of "human relationships" and the word "honest" are so far apart! Look at the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Lu Su is known as "honest," but this man specializes in being deceived and scolded!</p>
<p>Therefore, the number of people who are fooled on April 1st is actually not too many. And if there are still people who think that they can only tell lies on April 1st, then this gentleman is a little too naive himself—in my opinion, he is quite "foolish"!</p>
<h3>News with Mixed Feelings</h3>
<p>— Wang Shuchang</p>
<p>The newspaper reports: "The three universities of "St. John's," "Soochow," and "Hangchow" in this city will be merged into a joint university. The campus will be located at St. John's in this city, but in view of the insufficient campus space, Wang Shuchang will reclaim the "Zhongshan Park," which is the school's property, for his own use, so as to rebuild the school buildings, which can be completed within three years."</p>
<p>This piece of news, which is neither too big nor too small, although it cannot attract people's attention like the Jin Chao case or foreign tigers, I still have to pay a little attention to it. Because every citizen is somewhat related. If we speak from the standpoint of education, reclaiming property, expanding the campus, and increasing the number of students is worth praising. However, the school's property is the parkland of all citizens of Shanghai, and in Shanghai, where every inch of land is precious, it makes people feel that the parks are getting fewer and fewer, so Mayor Wu is also racking his brains about this and cannot make a decision.</p>
<p>Recalling when the Japanese soldiers occupied Shanghai, the Japanese side wanted to forcibly occupy the school as a barracks. After several negotiations, it was spared from being ravaged, which was also fortunate.</p>
<h3>God Bless You</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>"John," the boss said to the clerk, "Did you mix the glucose into the syrup?"</p>
<p>"Mixed."</p>
<p>"Did you add sand to the sugar?"</p>
<p>"Added."</p>
<p>"Did you soak the lettuce and mushrooms?"</p>
<p>"Soaked."</p>
<p>"Did you pour water into the milk?"</p>
<p>"Poured."</p>
<p>"Good, you can say the prayer."</p>
<h3>After Listening to Chinese Musical Works</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>On March 30th, there was a concert of Chinese works at the "Lyceum." Although it wasn't full, there were many listeners. It started with a Pipa solo "The Hegemon Bids Farewell to His Concubine," followed by Zhao Jingshen and Li Xitong's Kunqu opera, which I didn't seem to be interested in. Then there was an Erhu solo "Sickbed Lament," and another piece, I don't know if it was "Birds in the Empty Mountain." Following that was a Guqin solo "Flowing Water." Although those three solos had some technical variations, their musical value wasn't very high. Moreover, the timbre of the instruments was poor, the volume was insufficient, and there was noise. Although the instruments were amplified with loudspeakers, they were ultimately not perfect. If they cannot be improved, then they will be eliminated in the future, or only be loved by a part of the people who want to preserve the national essence.</p>
<p>After the break, there were all solos. Originally, there was a piano solo "Shepherd's Flute" (counterpoint by He Luting), but because the person didn't arrive, it wasn't performed. In terms of solos, there were works by Huang Zi, Zhao Yuanren, Liu Xue'an, and Chen Tianhe, among which Zhao Yuanren's "Selling Cloth Ballad" (lyrics by Liu Dabai) is quite suitable as a singing material for schools. Huang Zi's "Peasant's Joy" and "Searching for Plum Blossoms in the Snow" were also not bad. In my opinion, composers should have an international perspective, and not be too nationalistic, what must have a Chinese flavor or oriental color. Excellent pieces of music cannot be distinguished by German style or Russian style. The works of musicians are not used to represent a country; they represent all living and even non-living things. What everyone expresses sympathy for is true music. Chinese music is just starting to sow seeds, I hope it will produce the spiritual food that the people of the world need, because we Chinese people are a nation rich in emotions. This is my only hope after listening to this concert of Chinese musical works.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Gu Hongming</h3>
<p>— Husband</p>
<p>When the Anfu clique was in power, a new National Assembly election law was promulgated. A portion of the senators had to be elected by the Central Electoral College. All professors from national universities, or those with degrees from foreign universities, were eligible to vote. Consequently, many returned students with bachelor's and master's degrees offered their diplomas for sale. The individuals didn't need to be present; others would take their diplomas to register and vote. It was said that the going market price at the time was 200 yuan per diploma for temporary use. And it was only required to show the qualification. (At that time, 200 yuan was worth at least four million yuan today.)</p>
<p>An insignificant politician actually wanted to win over the old gentleman, Gu Hongming. He asked Mr. Gu to vote for him. Gu said, "My diploma has long been lost." The little politician said, "Who doesn't recognize you, sir? You don't need a diploma as long as you come to vote in person."</p>
<p>In his later years, Gu had already seen through everything in the world and found amusement in life. He said to the politician, "People sell their votes for 200 yuan each. I, old Gu, must sell mine for at least 500 yuan."</p>
<p>The politician said, "Others are 200, but for you, sir, 300." Gu refused to budge. He insisted on selling his vote for at least 400 yuan, and the politician eventually agreed.</p>
<p>The day before the election, the little politician indeed brought 400 yuan in banknotes and a ballot admission ticket to Gu's residence. He repeatedly urged Gu to go to the polling place the next day. As soon as the person left, Gu immediately went out and took the express train from Beijing to Tianjin that afternoon. He spent all 400 yuan on a courtesan in Tianjin named Yizhihua. After two days, when the money was gone, he went home.</p>
<p>The politician heard that Gu had returned and rushed to Gu's house, cursing him for being untrustworthy. Gu picked up a stick and pointed it at the politician, saying, "You're blind! How dare you use money to buy me! You even talk about integrity! Get out of here, and don't ever come to my door again!"</p>
<p>The politician, seeing Gu's stick, was so frightened that he obediently fled. The 400 yuan, which is equivalent to eight million today, was wasted by Gu Hongming on Yizhihua.</p>
<h3>The Fastest Development</h3>
<p>— Lu Qing</p>
<p>What is the shortest possible time for a photograph to be developed and printed, from shooting to completion?</p>
<p>Some photo studios in Shanghai offer "express photography" services, delivering photos within an hour. News photos in newspaper offices are developed even faster, taking only a few minutes. Recently, a new ultra-fast photography technique has been invented, completing the entire process from shooting to development in just fifteen seconds!</p>
<p>This ultra-fast photography is a new invention by Eastman Kodak in the United States and is also a military secret. The complete set of equipment includes a specially made camera, a set of developing equipment, and a projector. During shooting, a special flash is used, exposing the film at a rate of one ten-thousandth of a second. Then, using a special powerful chemical solution, the development process is completed in nine seconds at a high temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (ordinary film development temperature cannot exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit). Finally, the photo is dried with hot air, and the enlarged image is projected onto a screen using a projector. The entire process can be completed in fifteen seconds. This new invention was publicly demonstrated once on October 15th last year. The photos taken of a group of invited editors and reporters as they walked into the restaurant were clearly projected on the screen before they even reached their seats.</p>
<p>This new invention will undoubtedly attract attention from all walks of life, especially from photography reporters.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of a City in Peril</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But Lan didn't have time to pay attention to her. In the bright moonlight outside the cave, she had already spotted a familiar slender figure on the path to the left, rushing towards her like a charge; the figure appeared particularly tall. Closer now, Miao could already see that Old Zhu was carrying the short and plump Feifei on his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Mom! Brother! Mom! Brother!" Feifei was already shouting wildly from afar.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong immediately slipped out of Xiao Shen's hand, running up like a ball.</p>
<p>"Sister! Where's Rabbit Dad? Where's Rabbit Dad?"</p>
<p>Lan also unconsciously began to run like mad.</p>
<p>"Feifei! Feifei!" She shouted, disregarding everything, hot tears streaming down her face like broken threads.</p>
<p>"5111, 5271, 5144, 321712..." Old Zhu's whistle was loud and skillful, like a choir of soldiers singing a triumphal song.</p>
<p>"Damn it! This monster," Xiao Shen, lagging behind, felt a surge of rage rising in his heart, his tongue tasting a strong sourness.</p>
<p>July 2nd of the same year.</p>
<p>Japanese planes had bombed Guilin for three consecutive nights. The "Midsummer Night's Dream"-like good news from Xiangbei over the past ten days had also been completely shattered. Late last night, news leaked out from the banking circles that Baoqing had already fallen. Therefore, from the time the sky began to turn white this morning, there was great commotion again on every street in the city. The psychology of "when the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact" frightened every small citizen, and everyone was eager to leave this city, now threatened by enemy cavalry, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian, who lived on the upper floor of a small school in Dongjiang, was awakened by the disturbances in the alley outside at around six o'clock in the morning. He lazily rolled over on the bamboo bed, stretched his long legs, and was just planning to doze off again, but the noise from the wall was getting louder and louder, making it impossible for him to calm down and rest.</p>
<p>"Damn it! What is it again?" He sat up abruptly, cursing in his heart. (31)</p>
<h3>Eating Tiger Meat</h3>
<p>— Xin Shui</p>
<p>A newspaper in Nanjing said, "A visitor from Shanghai reported that a tiger meat stall has been set up on Shanghai Middle Road, displaying a live tiger in a cage and selling the meat of two dead tigers in pieces. Each tael costs 20,000 yuan, and each catty costs 320,000 yuan. Customers are scrambling to buy it. Most of the chefs have no cooking experience, causing them a great headache."</p>
<p>When I first read this news, I suspected that the so-called tiger was the result of the "tiger hunt" that had been making so much noise a few days ago, and everyone was "sleeping on its skin and eating its flesh." Later, I remembered that the so-called golden tiger had not actually been caught, and only became a rumor like "three men make a tiger," and then I realized that I was wrong. Now, what is being eaten is genuine tiger meat hunted by hunters, a tribute from small mountain villages. The people in the mountains know that the people of Shanghai have always been timid and weak. It is said that eating tiger meat can strengthen their courage and strength. It is hoped that after becoming brave and strong, they can truly defeat the rampant tigers, like Zhou Chu who shot and killed the white-browed tiger in the mountains. That would be the good fortune of the people.</p>
<p>Someone said, "A tiger's head and a swallow's jaw, flying and eating meat, this is the appearance of a marquis." Tiger meat should only be eaten by those who are ennobled. Common people do not have this kind of good fortune. If you don't believe it, just look at the fact that in Shanghai, "most chefs have no cooking experience, causing them a great headache," and you can verify what I said.</p>
<p>As for the "tiger hunt," it has long become "a tiger's head and a snake's tail." Ordinary people can only "feel anxious and endangered, as if treading on a tiger's tail," secretly crying out in danger. How can we talk about universally eating tiger meat?</p>
