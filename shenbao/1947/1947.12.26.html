<h3>洪蘭友談行憲展望　戡亂中求建國意義益重大</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國大籌備會秘書長洪蘭友，廿五日對記者談制憲國大之回憶懷行憲之展望，略稱：今日為去年制憲國大所議決憲法施行之日期，自今日始。我國家已開始步入民主憲法大域，憲法自本年元旦奉國府令公布後，一年來我政府一面戡亂，掃除行憲之障礙，一面立法定制，致力行憲之凖備，現行憲國代經全國普選，已產生達法定人數，開會日期亦已明令公布，立委，監委之選舉，亦在分別積極辦理中，凡行憲之凖備，無不加緊工作，以斯完備之民主憲法能按照旣定軌轍行之。洪氏　稱：吾人於回憶制憲工作艱難之際，益懔於行憲職責之重大，因行憲為我國政治改革之開端，亦民主建國之發軔。第一，我國政治自今日以後是達成五十年革命之偉大任務，憲政自今伊始，而在戡亂中救建國，以實現憲政，更覺其意義之重大與任命之艱鉅。今後民權更得加大其發展，使全國逐漸以法治保障人權，以憲政切求統一。第二，今後在政治建設方面，完全以全國所選舉之民意代表為政治推進之中心動力，則政治必可淸明，而國家元首係由人民總意所構成之國民大會所選出，自必能公正賢明。由人民直接選舉之立委，所決定之政策，必能反映全國人民之公意，得到人民之擁護，而切實施行，由省民間推選舉之監委，尤必能發生澄淸政治之效，至於行政·司法·考試三院，亦必受全國人民之監督，達到賢能之政治。第三，在政治制度方面，吾人希望於制與衡之原則下，能使國策之施行為靈活之運用，則政黨之和協合作無間，尤為今後建國順利推行之前提。第四，經濟政策必須敵合各階層之利益而無所偏頗，新立法院必能集中意志，產生全國所實行之經　濟之政策，求有以解決當前之經濟問題。（靑年黨宣傳部長及滬各界名流對行憲感想，刋二版一攔。）</p>
<h3>周以德談話　慶賀我行憲</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日合衆電〕今為中國行憲之日，美衆議員周以德稱：「該新憲法為中國之紀程碑，惟如欲使此憲法發揮宏效，則似需相當歲月。中國人民曾計劃於一九三七年實行憲政民主，然因日本侵略而未果，日本之侵略，使中國受阻多時，然吾人必須慶賀中國向前邁進，實施憲法一端，即可表示中國企求達成民主，並使人民獲得公民權利之決心。」渠並謂：「國會對華之一千八百萬美元緊急救濟撥款，對中國之民主力里，將有所邦助。此項撥款，使中國人民明瞭美國人民對於彼等至為關切得鼓勵。」</p>
<p>京中兩項運動　護憲與護黨護法</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕行憲肇始之際，首都頃正展開兩項相對之運動，一為護憲運動，一為護黨護法運動，前者為國代簽署提名當選人所發動，因渠等未經政黨提名，僅根據國代選能法，以五百人簽署提出而競選當選者渠等自國務會議通過一政黨提名補充條例後，其中因大多數為國民黨黨員，格於補充條例，即不能當選，而必須取退護辦法，退護與得票數少者，因而渠等對此項補充條例頗為不滿，而引起展開護憲運動。其次為中央提名國代所發起。渠等係由中央提出之候選人，因多被地方勢力或時間忽促，籌備未周，而獲票較少者，渠等在京亦組有聯宜會，廿五日晨並推定代表團，分別晋謁各國府委員及中常委，陳述彼等服從總裁電令及中央規定黨員競選辦法與護黨護法之目的。擄悉：各方答覆均表示中央自黨依照原定辦法辦理，國務會議通過之政黨提名補充條例，係與國代選罷法同日起生效者。</p>
<h3>馬鴻逵自京抵滬　據談此來檢查體格定下週返京　陜北兵力雄厚大局尙安</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕寗夏主席馬鴻逵將軍，為檢查體格，昨日偕夫人搭錢塘號附掛專車於午後二時三刻抵滬。記者往訪，據談：體格檢查完畢後返京，新年內可飛返寗夏。共匪在西北之兵力，因隨時流竄，難有精確之佔計，其戰術亦為乘虛而攻，動向難於預料，大凡過去匪軍曾盤踞之地區，易於被其滲透，未被盤踞之地帶，則較易於防守。肅淸西北匪軍，個人之見地，認為目前軍事固甚重要，但根本仍為政治。十年前江西剿共時，主席曾有」三分軍事，七分政治」之指示，此項原則今日仍適用，故在西北各省，此時應加强組織民衆，增强地方自衛武力，以配合國軍之行動。寗夏在此方面尙做得不够，但巳使共匪在本省活動困難，即情報工作亦難於進行。本人此次在京時，主席曾屢次召見，指示在政治軍事作大努力。西北車事建制，大體仍依舊軌，惟就近日所得之敎訓，酌予調整，日來外傳種種，頗有過甚其辭者。陜北縣榆林之捷後，大局尙安，國軍兵力甚雄厚，因環境上之需要，本人今後將多留陜北指揮軍事云。</p>

<p>蘇北六塘河國軍　衝入匪核心奏捷　當塲殲匪兩千餘　獲六百人</p>

<h3>平津記者團訪問歸來　太原情勢極安定　碉堡猶如繁星·公路密若蛛綱</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕平津記者記問太原孤島，已於聖誔節返平，以記者六日之觀察，晋全省一〇六縣市，國軍目前雖僅佔卅縣市，但以太原為中心之晋中平原十六縣，因兵農合一之實施，與民衆自衛之舉辦，全區散匪絕跡，國軍政權日趨鞏固，被人目為孤島之太原情勢至為安定。由於平民經濟之實施，大部平民皆能享受合作社廉價配售之糧·布·鹽，最低生活皆可無虞。效外洋灰鐵筋之碉堡，密如夏季繁星，環城鐵路已完成一條，別一條將飛機塲圍繞在內，亦即可完成。為聯絡各戰略據點之公路，密如蛛綱，總長達六百華里。此外，並有市外壕兩道。今日太原堪稱全國城防最鞏固之城市，惟太原人士均以憂鬰之目光，注視運城，深慮運城一旦失守，晋南將永無規復希望。閻主任雖屆六五高齡，精神仍甚　鑠。渠認為華北應先謀北平·天津·張家口·大同·歸綏·包頭·太原·保定·唐山諸據點之鞏固，然後再謀面的擴張。對全國剿匪，渠認僅以軍事剿匪為「以舟碰舟」，必難戰勝中共「以水覆舟」之政略。全國惟有運用政治經濟方法，使民衆力最盡量發揮，始可制「以水覆舟」之狂略。在此孤島中，西北實業公司所局數十工廠之烟囪，仍黑烟燎繞，生產大量鋼鐵·洋灰·苛性　·毛織品·紙張，以換回大批原料及消費品，成為此孤島之輸血管。太原對外陸路交通全斷，僅賴空運大隊及中航公司空運。又，閻錫山主任在幷表示，主張召集全國報館記者，開一國事討論會。</p>

<h3>經濟戡亂母忘生產！</h3>
<p>經濟戡亂是一個很動聽的名詞！但　要緊的是；經濟戡亂是建設而不是破壞，是增加生產而不是减少生產。否則戡亂其名而是亂其實了！</p>
<p>為什麼呢？因為食衣住行，民生四大需要，沒有一樣不須取給於物資。故只有物資是民生眞正的需要；換句話說，也只有增產纔是國家經濟政策的最大目標。在平時固如此，而在戰時尤其如此。通常所稱貧之，歸根說來，即是物資缺乏之謂。姑不說要提高人民的生活水準，就使要想維持人民的生活水準而不讓　再降低，也非增加生產和增加財富不可。這是關於經濟的常識，也是一般人所公認的原則。</p>
<p>任何國家，任何時代，經濟政策的目標原是一致的，第一是生產，第二是生產，第三還是生產！然而實施時所採的途徑，則往往大有差別。但不論採取積極的手段，或選擇消極的辦法，或循迂回的路綫，或用直接的方式，要不外因地因時，　酌活用，總以達到增產為惟一的歸宿。其直接的與積極的手段，作用較顯，因果易明，可以無須祥述。至於一切消極的與迂回的辦法，則因為情形較為複雜，技術亦似較為進步，易為一般人所誤解；即身處局中，參與其事的人，也往往目迷五色，不知不覺地會迷失了原來的方向，有時甚至南轅北轍，和原來想要「增產」的目的背道而馳。</p>
<p>例如拿經濟制來說罷。管制經濟，亦稱計劃經濟，其動機所在，目標顯然在增產，即把凡與生產有關的種種條件，統盤籌劃，以期可以補偏救敝，增加效能，其事本極明白。但為了統盤籌劃之故，有許多地方，不能不截長補短調盈濟虛，以作合理的分配。為了補偏救敝之故，更有許多地方，不能不權衡輕重，捨彼取此，實施取締的手段，不得巳時甚或加以箝制，約束，遏絕，懲警，以求計劃的貫澈。單從表面上，或局部上看來，這些貌似消極的辦法，意存限制，似與增產的目的背道而馳，而實則捨小全大，移東補西，所謂手揮五絃，目送飛鴻，原與直接的扶助和獎掖，要無二致。</p>
<p>更舉實例來說：如取締囤積投機，這在業中人方面看來，不免是一種嚴重的打擊，從而破壞了他們的財路，消滅了他們的行衆，（如最近禁止的錢兌衆），這好像與增產渺不相涉。然而囤風遏絕，黑市歛跡，物價漸平，生活暫安，導遊資歸入生產，則亦未　不可認為是間接的增產方法。</p>
<p>又如統制金融，統制花紗布，統制日用品等等，在當衆者方面看來，也多少總有些不方便，不利益，至少在　手調整的過程中，其種困難和損失，勢將無從避免，因而妨碍了他們原來的營運和生產。然而統制如果眞正適宜，配合如果確實得法，則實施統制以後，其營運與生產的效果，也很可能反而加强起來。其關鍵全在統制能否適宜能否得法而已。</p>
<p>所以當前經濟上最為生要的問題，不在是否應予統制或營制，而在遵些統制或管制的後果，是否確能有助於增產，換句話說，在增產這個大前提上，這些統制或官制的手段，是否必要？已否過分？倘或多方干涉，無裨生產，或因箝制過甚的結果，只會使得物資减產，廠號歇業，貨運停滯，關卡走私，百業蕭條，因而招致了工人失業，物資缺乏的第一重惡果，更引起了社會問題和經濟問題的第二重惡果，則是這些政策，很可能犯了迷失原來方向的嚴重錯誤，自然不是國家所以實施統制的初意！</p>
<p>我們在這裏，並不願對這些政策，重新加以檢討，但要鄭重地指出：增產這個目標，在無論何種情勢或名義下，都不可絲毫加以漢視的。因為現代國家，其經濟上種種設施和努力，沒有不集中在這個增加生產一方向的。大而言之，如馬歇爾的援歐計劃，麥克阿瑟的對日政策，以及英美法三國的對德經濟合作，其目標一槪都在復興經濟，增加生產，其情形固自顯然，無庸多說，小而言之，如蘇聯的　　五年計劃，英國的擴大出口計劃，日本的「飢俄出口」口號，其心力所貫注亦何嘗不在復興經濟，增加生產？老實說罷，現在全世界不願意經濟復興和生產增加的，只有我國的共匪！他們到處在毀路，毀廠，毀礦，毀市，毀農村，以及破壞田園，破壞民居，燒殺刼掠，無所不用其極，其唯一的作用其極，其唯一的作用，無非要盡力破壞一切生產，消滅一切物資，藉以迫害全國同胞沒有生路，從而搗亂整個的中華民國。從這些毒辣的手段看來，我們當可益知切實增產的重要，惟有切實增　，　　是針對共匪一切破壞手段的有效　策；亦惟有切實增產，　是安定民生　定國基的根本你你產法。</p>
<p>軍事戡亂與經濟戡亂，是現在挽救危局的兩大途徑，自願輔軍相依，　程並　，以期迅速地克　戡亂的大衆。伹我們須知道，這兩件事名義　　　稱戡亂，而期手段的剛柔緩急，却不容不加以分別。因為軍事本具破壞的性質，牠是剛性的，亦是消極的。只須殺敵致果，摧陷廓淸，巳獲得完全的勝利。而經濟則屬建股的性質，牠是柔性的，亦是積極的，更是牽一髪而動全身的。在實施此項經濟戡亂計劃的時候，為補偏救敝殺一　百起見，雖未嘗不可採用相當的强制和箝制手段，但應該不忘其目的仍是增產而不是减產，其性質仍是建設而不是破壞，其作用實在手扶助產業界而決不應該是壓抑工商業，視一切工商業者盡為可殺的奸商！所以在實行經濟戡亂的時候，固然可以對若干蓄意營私舞弊的人處以嚴刑峻法，但究不可不處處體卹商艱，俯順民情，以期减少他們的痛苦至最小限度，其不必要的干涉和過份的箝制，自以力求避免為上策。便是執行戡亂的方式，亦不必一定摹倣軍事的姿態，因為究竟所戡的對象不同，所用的力最和形式亦自然不必盡同。最要緊的一句話，在目前的經濟問題上，我們是要戡亂，而決不是要無形中去造亂！</p>
<p>我們何以要說這句話？因為現在有許多緊急措施，似乎過分普遍和嚴酷，致造成了風聲鶴唳的景象，更有許多手段如限制匯款，緊縮頭寸等，不免過於嚴格，有時甚至違背法規和常例，致金融失其融通，通貨無從通流，使各地貨物失去其交流的機能。這種經濟戡亂辦法，在短期間，雷厲風行一下，雖未　不可收暫時穏定的功效，但形格勢禁，因噎廢食，久而久之，勢必至生產萎縮，物資稀少，釀成將來無窮的隠憂。須知目前全國商業行莊存款，不及戰前卅分之一，膨脹的通貨百分之九十不在行莊手裏了。倘再使存底枯竭，通貨唶流，行莊失效，工廠停產，有如上海市商會所稱採運裹足，貨物倒流，其於商業金融的前途上，究竟利害得失如何，似亦値得鄭重研討。高唱經濟戡亂者的最後目標，是否以造成此等現象為怏意，而顯示其不顧一切的決心？實在値得老成謀國者的注意。我們的見解，總以為增加生產，方是抑平物價與安定民生的惟一正當辦法。治本也罷，治標也罷，加强也罷，加緊也罷，凡與增產這大前提有附阻碍或甚而相違背的。俱有加以迅速改善的必要！</p>
<p>靑年黨宣傳部長　王師曾評論行憲</p>
<p>〔中央社訊〕昨（廿五日）為中華民國憲法開始生效之歷史性紀念日。中國靑年黨宜傳部長王師曾氏，特對記者發表感想如次：「憲法開始實施，除別有背景和企圖之共產黨而外，凡屬中國人民，莫不一致表示其欣慰之　忱，就憲法的內容而言，確為能够兼顧理想與現實，折衷各方意見，適合中國國情及世界潮流之進步的民主白憲法。今後如何纔能使憲法切實而順利地施行的關鍵，首為政治上社會上之上層的人物，能够養成守法的民主的習慣和精神，遵守憲法，身體力行，以為民衆的表率。次為各政黨能够健全其組織，約束其黨員，充分發揮指導民衆，推進民主之效用，蓋民主政治離不開政黨之運用。如果政黨不能約束其黨員，則有黨等於無黨，民主政治無從推進也。尤其是在中國目前之情形下，尤須各政黨能够共體時艱，捨小異而就大同，於彼此協調之中，收互相監營之效，俾可為多黨的民主政治，建立一個嶄新的良好的榜樣。憲法之能否順利實施，此點頗關重要。想各黨人士亦同感。」</p>
<p>滬各界名流　談行憲感想</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日為我國行憲之日，記者特訪各界知名之士，探詢感想及希望。奚玉書氏表示：行憲為我國人民一般之希望。此次選舉，有若干地　因客觀情勢而未能舉辦，實為美中不足，憲法公布在去年，但未實行，本人此次遊歷台灣，該地省議會中，即有人提及在憲法下應享有何種自由者，而不知行憲尙未開始。此類誤會，今後即可免除。又實行憲政時立法院之地位最為重要，因立委選舉之延期舉行，此時尙無民選之立法院。我人如言：眞正之行憲，須待民選立法院存在之後，當屬正確。有一事値得特別提出者，即目前一般人民對憲法之瞭解程度太少，故今後行憲之宣傳工作，　常重要。又各地之地方長官，本身對憲法之認識亦嫌不够，甚至有對行憲不感需要者。</p>
<p>工商界方面，吳蘊初氏認為憲法條文，應切實依其制憲之精神實施，方有意義。紡業巨子王啓宇則謂：憲政實施後，人民應享有身體·精神·財產上之自由。惟在戡亂其內，根據總動員法，政府一切可厲行管制，精神上不無牴觸。但此乃國大計，固當別論。國大召開距今尙有三個多月，希望官吏及人民對憲法能多作研究，使實施憲政為一成功。</p>

<h3>英國經濟近訊</h3>
<p>— 本耿</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦通訊〕英國的經濟問題，主要的一點，是因爲本國的出產，不能維持國內人民的日常生活，因之有些東西例如糧食，必須仰賴「進口」，幷且在全世界大多數地方都在鬧經濟問題的時候，英國不但要「進口」，幷且必須向所謂「硬幣」國家主要是美國購買。道樣，它做成英國「黃金」之不斷消耗。（除非英國出口量能够超過進口量，但這在目前是談不到的。）最近三個月來英國黃金的消耗如次：（單位百萬英鎊）　　如上表所示，在三個月之間，英國消耗了二億六千三百萬鎊。依據今年八月的數字，在八月底時，英國的金準備約爲六億鎊，如果扣除上面所述的三個月的消耗，金準備勢將降到四億餘鎊。但據估計，在些三個月內，英國田南非購買若千黃金另外加上新自金鑛所得，目前的金準備，大約尙有五億餘鎊，但其消耗率已很可觀。這些黃金的出售，主要是美國，少部份轉讓與瑞典瑞士，其原因當然都是爲了抵補因必需品而做成的入超。向國際貨幣基金購買美元，自然爲了被賬之用。不寗唯是，在此三個月內，英國還在加拿大貸款下用了二千二百萬鎊，所以三個月的實際消耗，應該是一億八千五百萬鎊。</p>
<p>這種悄形，當然不自今日始。英國有一部份經濟學者認爲主要的問題，是經濟政策問題。早在去年七月，阿蘭敎授（ProfR．G．D．Allen）就認爲工業方面有問題，他指出了當時「戰爭」工業（機器，五金，及化學工業）保有較戰前多百分之十六的勞動力，而所有其他工業，所保有的勞動力則較戰前减少百分之三十。這是表示英國工業方面之勞動力的分配有問題，也有人認爲英國經濟政策的問題，是「太多的錢在追求很少的東西」，因此必須設法减少每人的收入。這些討論，雖然去年就有，但是到了今年夏天，由於金準備消耗之日以嚴重，而引起許多人的注意。</p>
<p>主要的一點，有些人爲英國的　題，在於通貨膨脹（這裏所謂通貨膨脹不僅指單純的貨幣數量的增加，而是包括信用膨脹及貨幣流通率的增加在內），社會的購買力過份擴張，而通貨膨脹則與政府的大量資本之放出有關。最近牛津大學的哈勞特先生（Mr．Roy　Harrod）在其新出版之本討論英國經濟問題的書中（書名爲AreThereHarrdshipNeccessary？）認爲增加出口及平衡對外賬目之失敗，只是資金支出過多之副產品，他主張政府在每年資金支出方面可以减少五億鎊（按英國政府之資金支出包括建築人民居住之房屋及各種設備在內。）這些意見，是代表着政府應該緊縮的意見。因爲在某些人看來，至少英國政府的某些官吏，是主張大量資金放出的。</p>
<p>最近英國的情形，由此次國會所討論的預算　來，增加稅率，提高物價，似乎也是在求國內人民購買力的减低，同時增加政府收入，以减少發行。本月二日英國政府發表關於一九四八年之資金的白皮書，也宣布一九四八年之賽金支出，要較原定减少二千萬鎊。一般看來，新任財政大臣克里浦斯，如果和前任財政大臣道爾頓有所不同的話，似乎是克氏是更進一步之束緊腰帶以解決英國經濟問題之主張者。因此可能英國的物價上漲還只是開始，定量分配的物品還要减少。前星期，克氏在其談話中，已表示着如果產量不能較現在增加百分之十二，則目前衣料之分配量無法維持。（按目前英國衣服分配量在五個月中爲每人二十「點」，而一套西服須二十六「點」。）</p>
<p>另外有二點在這裏附帶說明的；其一，在上月英國市地方議會選舉中，工黨頗爲失勢，有些人認爲這是工黨政府之失人心，但是最近連續舉行之國會議席補缺選舉，工黨沒有失去一個議席，似乎人民還是希望工黨再試驗它的政策。其二，有些帶有舊式自由主義思想者，認爲經濟是不必管制的，讓它自然發展，從而反對工黨今日的作風，但是這種觀念，似乎在英國沒有引起太多的注意·即使保守黨首領邱吉（即戰時英國首相）氏，雖在其公開演說中批評工黨政府，但他也並不樑　放棄管制經濟。（十二月九日寄自倫敦）</p>

<h3>聖誕老人　送給香港的「禮物」</h3>
<p>〔本報香港廿三日航訊〕香港這幾天的「聖誕擠購」熱流中，聽說洋酒一項獨佔鰲頭。在這個遠重州稀有的不受外匯缺乏影響的小島上，聖誕禮物可說是「包　萬有」，記者不必在這裏細表。但據有資格的商人談稱：今年香港人的購買力，比去年差了百分之二十至三十。而市塲上的貨物，有些京以仳於成本的售價傾銷，爲的是市面銀根奇緊緊大公司的營業額，最近兩三天來，每天也不能超過十萬元，小一些的僅得三四萬元，商人正爲展望明年而愁眉不展！自港府上週頒佈管理銀行新條例後投機份子已漸有窮途之感，黃金每兩跌破三百元大關，繼續跌至二百八十元以下。港府發行的第一期五千萬元復興公債，（三十年後還本）據外籍觀察家說：「幾乎沒有一個影子跑到　台去！」恰恰和這黯淡的一而粗反，出售明年一月十九日開獎的春季馬票的香港馬會，卻見人山人海，如瘋如狂，假如聖誕老人果有「禮物」送給香港，也許就是那個五十萬元的未來頭彩吧！（本報特約記者子健）</p>

<p>注意共匪的目標</p>

<h3>魯西南行</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日航訊〕記者於本月十五日由濟南出發赴魯西南視察前三日，適靑島李先良市長來濟勞軍，，一夕深談，助我對魯東現局瞭解不少。自旬日來遍歷泰安·兗州·曲阜·滕縣·臨城·徐州·至浦口，其中並一度折往濟寗及棗莊，臨沂等地視察後，萍踪所至，幾二千里，艱險倍嘗，茲擇要爲本報讀者吿。除掉黃河北岸以外，作爲山東</p>
<p>四大戰略要點</p>
<p>的濟南，青島，兗州，臨沂，　異一座大廈的四大支住。其中以濟南爲中心，西至東阿，南至泰安，東經張店，淄博至濰縣坊子的膠濟西段兩側在王耀武司令官直接指揮下五月餘來，始終在國軍之手，膠濟東段的高密，膠縣，及山東半島的昌邑，平度，掖縣，招遠，黃縣，蓬萊，　　，牟平，甚至咸海衛的市區，　因國軍正規軍陸續南調大別山區，不得不自動陸續放棄。在同樣情形下，魯西南進河以西各縣，除掉荷澤，單縣，金鄕，魚台以外，其餘　城，等在無可計數的拉鋸戰下雖亦迄在共匪壓迫蹂躪之中，魯東南的諸城，莒縣，甚至費縣亦於最近被匪硬打軟吃以去，（山東一〇七縣三普通市現縣城在國軍控制中者爲四十五縣二市）但是，　由於作爲靑島及膠東的戰略要點龍口·烟台·威海術沿海村莊及劉公鳥，萊陽，海陽，即墨等仍在國軍之手。（尤其重要的是沿海諸要港）　再由於作爲兗州外圍的戰略要點濟寗，滕縣，曲阜等，始終在國軍控制之中。　由於作爲臨沂外圍要點的郯城，日照，及石臼所亦仍在國軍守衛之中。共匪雖可</p>
<p>佔若干小便宜</p>
<p>於一時，但只要山東地方團隊正式建立就緒後，山東的共匪依然無法逃避其覆滅的慘運的。</p>
<p>濟南的城防工事正在積極加强中，靑島外圍自城陽經即墨，勞山至海濱早有一條被外人譽爲「鐵城」的永久工事於今夏即吿完成，兗州嘗被匪圍攻廿閱月，雖得力於吳化文部的孤軍苦守，但其工事堅强，要亦不可沒，臨沂原爲魯共政治軍事經濟中心，其城防工事原爲最壞，因共匪的戰術向不講究築工事，但自國軍於本年三月光復發，由魯第三行政區王專員洪九親自設計督導下，自本年五月起，每天</p>
<p>動員五千人工</p>
<p>計功耗百萬餘工，三百五十餘萬担石灰，至本月初，已吿正式竣工，全城週長共四三三八公尺，高八點九公尺，厚四公尺，垜高一點九公尺，厚點九公尺，城墻周圍　設地　，墻上每一二公尺射擊孔，七八公尺設機槍射擊所，城門樓三個，西門內外二，南門一，並附設砲兵觀八萬，郯城十五萬，臨沂卅萬共達百餘萬。難民的增加使我們一則以喜，一則以懼，喜的是共匪殘暴恐怖，不得民心，所以人民向政府區域跑，懼的是難民本身對政府，也是一個「包袱」，是加重了政府一個無比的重担。</p>
<p>今年普年普遍在山東全省的是旱　和兵災，但在魯西和魯南除此而外，尙有所謂水災和風災，其中尤以濟寗“臨沂受災最烈，臨沂的大水是廿年來前所未有，今年顆粒未收，老百姓即運以高粱作煎餅亦不可得，而于現在起，即有大部份已被迫以紅薯梗子煮爛充釩，除主食而外，在臨沂燃料也成了最嚴重的問題，今年春夏之交，卅萬大軍兩萬餘匹馬過境，不僅使</p>
<p>城周圍三十里</p>
<p>已無一草一木，就連棺材的木頭也多被挖出來當柴燒，馬因無充足馬料可吃，甚至以他馬之馬尾充飢，再加之征實，征購，軍糧，保安糧，征兵測所及指探所，此外，城內並設有兵工廠，修械所，因此魯省府西南行署彭主任國棟說得好：臨沂城防工事之佳，堪稱東方的馬其諾防綫。此項沂蒙山區核心工事的如期建立，旣可節省兵力，且可阻過共匪的回竄及重建沂燕山區根據地，實在關係着整個魯中魯南的安危。</p>
<p>但亦正由於上述城防的鞏固建立，在鄉保據點工事及地方團隊未普遍建立前，各地的民衆遂多自動逃集到上列各地來。據官方估計，山東</p>
<p>流亡在省內外</p>
<p>的難民原約七百餘萬，現在除掉半　業復負還鄕，四分之一因膠東魯中及魯西南戰事使還難民慘遭共匪戕害或餓死病死，餘下的再除掉流亡在省境以外未列入者外，僅省內較大城鎭有統計數字者，爲濟南七萬，濰縣縣五萬，靑島廿五萬，烟台六萬，龍口六萬，劉公島三萬，濟寗抽丁，老百姓已再不是什麼痛苦問題，而成了生存問題，因此，引起了該區人民大　的「逃荒」，「逃亡」，實際上也即是「逃死」的問題，懦弱些的因不堪　餓，多個別目殺甚至　家自殺，有的爲了與其逃出來流亡以死，亦有不顧一切再回匪區遭匪殘殺的。這種種情形實在己到了「易子而食，析骸而　」的最慘極人寰的程度。（本報特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>本巿食米來源無虞匱乏　米價皮動即將平定　全面配售事已在縝密計議中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近米價波動，影響中下階級市民生活甚鉅。社會局長吳開先昨吿記者：本市今後米糧來源無虞匱乏，　聯總結束後有糧食二萬噸，其中一萬噸撥予人民慈善救濟團體，一萬　交出社會部分配，上海可配撥一部份。　美國撥助我國剩餘救濟物資十二萬五千噸糧食，在京滬平津穗五市配售，明年一月間第間批二萬噸噸即可到達。本市將成立配售美國救濟物資委員會，在委員未全部聘定前，其業務吳巿長囑暫委託民食調配會辦理。　中國向世界糧食市塲購買之糧食，已運滬四千餘噸，尙有四萬餘噸於明年一月間可絡續到齊，本週內即有三千餘噸可到達。該項糧食整個供應上海民食，對穩定木市米價，常有極大帮助。吳局長並因今後民食調配會之責職重大，將要求市長予以改組，以肩負調配本市民食之重大責任。</p>
<p>關於本巿實施全面配售糧食事，據吳局長稱有此趨勢，尙待商量決定。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕自民食調節委員會成立後，配給工作，即行展開，據民調會負責人談：本市食米之配給，每月爲二十萬零九千石，公敎人員佔二萬二千石，工人，學生，貧民佔十八萬七千石。美國救濟物資內之食米運到後，亦參加配給，數額定爲二十萬零九千石，連現有之配給量，兩共擴增爲四十一萬八千石。本巿以四百四十萬人口計，平均每人每月配食米一斗五升，每月共需六十六萬石，除四十一萬八千石，僅缺廿四萬二千石。每日差八千石左右，但南北市每日平均可到米一萬五千石，每月共四十餘萬石，尙多廿萬石。麵粉尙不包括在內，本市每月可產麵粉四十五萬包，以兩包半折合一石食米計，等於廿二萬石食米。即使市塲食米顆粒俱無，本巿食米，亦無問題，決無恐慌之處。</p>
<h3>股巿人心向榮　臨收俱呈堅俏</h3>
<p>華股昨以空方有張羅永紗籌碼之訊，人心向榮，業中大戶欲擒故縱，逢高有售，中途不免有回。但小股仍感俏利，證券帮衆志成城，臨收又堅。</p>
<p>晨開時見但，永紗以五〇五元及五一五元開盤，開後遞交選見五一三元，小股又吿激昻，麗安中法新華掛漲停，永紗逐步漲到五二一元及五三六元，旋退落至五一五元及五三〇元，華豐榮豐勤興亦迫漲限。息價開低，永紗高價達五二六元及五四三元，近午報挫，跌至五〇六元及五一三元，午收爲五一〇元及五二一元。結果較前收計即交股新華中法華豐麗安榮豐漲停後有回，軋好半成至成半不等。五和跌停後復高，亦升一成。景福新光閘北信和各漲半成，商務大通中泥微降，餘均小升。遞交股華豐漲停後有回，與勤興同升一成，美亞獨平，新光升半成，餘均微升。</p>
<p>後市以華豐麗安新華掛漲停，而永紗升至五二一元及五五三一元。旋退至五一〇元及五二一元低價。入後國行雖有差進，尙費曲折，中法由勤興景綸閘北掛漲停，對股市有利之華股可獲貸款，及大額面存款證等流言又起，永紗竟抬高至五三三元及五四二元高價結束。結果較晨收計即交股華豐麗安新華中法勤興景綸閘北漲停，美亞景福統益中絲各漲一成，新光華新信和內衣商務火柴中泥漲半成，餘均微升。遞交股華豐勤興漲停，景福升一成，餘均好起半成。塲外各老股仍見穩健，公用股再俏一成。</p>
<p>第三八號經紀人吳文會，經營塲外交易，除移送法院辦理外，在未裁定前，證交公吿應停止入塲。</p>
<p>年關即屆，證券交易所因銀行結賬，及新年休假關係，已定自本月廿九日後市起至一月四日止，暫停交易，共計休息六天半。又該所六一期遞交，將自廿九日早市開做，至一月六日交割云。</p>
<h3>統債見低　外股轉升</h3>
<p>公債昨參差不一，各債榮少而辱多。統丙晨開三〇六〇〇元，高價三一〇〇〇元，回降至三〇三〇〇元左右結束。結果較前收計甲乙低四百元，丙降六百元，丁挫七百元，戊種升三百元，成交祗三百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨稍挺進，港申電仍報三元半，人心見穩，除怡啤小疲外，榮者居多。怡紗晨開四〇萬，盤上至四二萬外收市，證券帮出入不一。結果較前收計怡紗鋼業漲半成，墾植漲一成，紙版祥泰電話尙平，怡啤微挫，餘均小升</p>
<h3>棉紗步昂　布疋回升</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開平庸，旋以客帮吸納，布價上揚，本街染織廠亦出手動辦，交易轉盛，行情步昻。迨至最後，四十二支藍鳳細紗高至四千九百五十萬元，較之上日續漲一百三十萬。其餘各支粗細紗，亦均挺升，自五六十萬至百萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開以紡建公司開售，籌碼增加，同業進意懈怠，浮多頻加了結，喊價趨軟。詎至十一點後，各方辦胃復健，山西帮對四君子嗶嘰通知單收進甚多，行情稍見轉堅，塲外四君子嗶嘰喊價提高一百卅九萬二三千元，有人　進。十二磅龍頭細布，正午回升至一百卅七萬二千元（限價），比上日步漲二千元。此外五福陽鶴及特細布亦升三·五千至一萬五千元，嗶嘰及元直責漂布等，則軋跌自一萬至四萬元，惟粗布及藍布士林布等，脚地甚硬，挺升三·五萬元不一。</p>
<h3>行莊投資生產事業　應照銀行法辦理　買賣證券不得超過限額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於銀行錢莊投資生產事業，暨買賣有價證劵，及信託公司兼營商業或儲蓄銀行業務者，均應遵照銀行法之規定辦理。頃據財政部解釋稱：「查銀行錢莊投資生產事業，而爲有限責任股東時，應依照公司法第廿條，暨部頒之管理銀行辦法第十一條之規定辦理，前經本部於卅五年十月十四日，以京錢庚三字第三一三一號通令遵照在案。</p>
<p>自銀行法公佈施行後，本部前頒之管理銀行辦法，業經通令廢止，各銀行錢莊投資生產事業，自應遵照銀行法之規定辦理，惟各種銀行在未依法調整業務確定性質以前，投資限額應一律暫照銀行法第五十三條（商業銀行投資限額）之規定，（其股票購價每一公司不得超過其存款總額百分之二，總額不得超過其存款總額百分之二十）辦理。至省縣銀行投資限額，應暫照銀行法六十三條（實業銀行投資限額）之規定辦理。</p>
<p>所有上述各種銀行，以前投資若已超過限額者，並應於一年內調整之。又銀行錢莊辦理投資生產事業，及買賣有價證券，應照銀行法第五十條第七第　兩款，及第五十九條第五第七兩款，嚴格劃分，（即買賣有價證券與購入公司股票不得相混）。</p>
<p>其會計處理，尤應依照銀行統一會計制度之規定，分別立帳，不得混淆。再査在銀行法施行以前，信託公司兼營商業或儲蓄銀行業務者，應照銀行法第八十三條第二項之規定，嚴格劃分其所營商業或儲蓄銀行部份，應照銀行法第三章第五章各條條規定辦理。</p>
<h3>銀根續鬆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨銀根續鬆，　息二角四，四行二局差進七四九億，中央入二五二〇億，大交換出三二億，小交換出七一七億，中國出一五八九億，交通出一四八億，其他行局出多入少。</p>
<h3>靑島煤荒嚴重　紡建各廠全停　束雲章發表緊急呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司總經理束雲章，昨爲該公司所屬靑島各紗廠停工情形嚴重，向輿論界發表緊急呼籲，望中樞各有關當局，速予合理解決。據談：該公司所屬靑島各紗廠，共約有紗錠卅五萬枚。惟自上月廿八日起，因煤斤短　，大部停工。由各廠輪流開工，日開僅八萬錠。惟後以僅到煤二千噸，至本月廿二日起，存煤到煤全部用罄，致各廠紗錠完全陷於停工。現靑島各廠，有工人共二萬餘人，職負亦有一千餘人。停工期間，乃須支給半薪，月耗開支三百餘億元。復以靑島難民　集，影響地方治安堪處。然該項煤荒問題，並非絕對不能解決，祗須設法撥借，即可彌縫目前脫節之危機。又該公司另正與國行接洽，望將靑島各廠產紗五千件外銷，易取印煤五萬噸。印煤以熱力强大，該項煤量，足够靑島各廠六個月之用。而六個月內靑島各廠，決可生產各支紗九萬件，內除五千件易煤，百分之二十之紗支外銷，計一萬五千件外，尙需要。故深望有關常局，權衝輕重，使生產事業所需之煤斤，早獲合理解決之途徑云。</p>
<h3>台幣匯率調整　台糖昨起加價</h3>
<p>自台幣匯率最近由八四元對一元，調整至九〇元對一元後，此間台糖公司廿五日起已將糖價照比例每担普遍增加七萬五千元。茲誌其各種新價如次：　特號砂白一一七萬五千元，　一號砂白一一四萬五千元，　二號砂白一一一萬五千元，　三號砂白一〇七萬五千元，　赤砂一〇八萬五千元，　台靑一〇二萬五千元，　特號棉白一一九萬五千元，　一號棉白一一六萬五千元，　二號棉白一一三萬五千元，　冰糖一六五萬元。該公司廿五日開售第四七期食糖，其價格悉照新規定辦理，至配額及其種類，則未予更動。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巾國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售三八〇四○疋，申購單共九三一張，內廠商二一張，購布一九八〇疋，布號九一○張，購布三六〇六〇疋。</p>
<h3>强制收兌私藏白銀案　關係人提起訴願　列舉七項理由要求發還原銀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一月前本巿發生之强制收兌私藏白銀案，刻聞該案關係人，已由周一志律師代撰訴願畫，列舉理由七點，要求中央銀行發還收兌之白銀。茲探誌理由大要如次：</p>
<p>按民國廿四年十一月三日，財政部佈吿施行法幣辦法，早與現在國內外經濟環境不相吻合。而所定之辦法，非如其他法規之有永久性。矧當時法幣本身價値，與銀幣相等。茲者法幣貶値過甚，常時法幣一百元，合美金廿九元半。茲者縱依國行掛牌，市價僅値美金一厘有餘。故陳舊已久之辦法，實不能再適用。</p>
<p>中央銀行上項處分，謂係依照卅二年九月廿三日財部公佈之銀幣銀類兌換法幣辦法。然此項法令，係屬行政機關之一種行政命令，並非法律，應由主管部依照實際情形，經濟變動狀態，隨時修改或廢止，以適合現狀。</p>
<p>査國府罰金罰　，已比照原定數額提高至一千倍，他如政府之征收田賦，以上海而論，連同預借，其總額在戰前三萬倍以上。戰前銀行存款，近亦通過加倍發還。獨强制收兌存銀，必欲援引十二年前之舊法，實不合情理。</p>
<p>查卅二年十月十八日國府公佈施行之妨害國幣懲治條例第一，四，六，各條規定，究其立法原意，均着重於意圖營利或私運，及僞造變造銷燬者罰之，業已明白規定。對於單純藏儲者，並無明文處罰。即就本年政府頒佈管制黃金法規之精神而言，亦表明金銀之特有人，並不違法。又査財部二一九五一號覆開封代電，內對收集銀幣，而並無意圖賣買牟利者即不在沒收充公之例。</p>
<p>政府對白銀，始終未曾宣佈收歸國有，藏銀並不背法，而銀樓亦准許出售銀類物品，獨不許民間藏存，實非事理之平。</p>
<p>按卅四年十二月八日國府公佈復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條及第十三條之規定，係人民與人民間時間上經濟變動之救濟補充辦法，藉維公允之原則。而政府與人民間，顯失公允之辦法。</p>
<p>吾國戰後，人民飽經痛苦，元氣未復，需要安定及保育政策。今對存銀有此不利人民之處置，民間稍有存銀者，爲之寒心，引起社會之不安。勝利前重慶對於黃金儲蓄，硬扣四成，使政府大失威信，可爲前車之鑒。</p>

<h3>健康的警鐘——痛</h3>
<p>— 蘇復</p>
<p>聖誕的鐘聲在敎堂裏叮噹，告訴我們凡是信耶蘇的該去崇拜了。空襲警報在樹了。告訴我們該逃到防空壕裏去了。凡是鐘聲，總是一種報吿，有喜有懼。在我們人的身體裏，也有警鐘，警吿我們某一個臟器/在開始病變，應當去注意，去治療，這個警鐘最普通的是痛。</p>
<p>一般的說來，人生最苦惱之一是痛。不論是英雄或好漢，對於痛的忍受，總有相當的限度，沒有一個人不怕痛，更沒有人喜歡痛，痛是人類的敵人，健康的寃家。但是我說，痛是人體的救星，健康的保障，因爲有了痛，才使得我們及早注意，及早去治療。痛，不是個病，他不過是病的先兆，在醫學上說，這該是一種症狀，他表面是惡意的侵襲，其實，卻是善意的警吿。假使祗注意表面的痛，去制止他，而忽略了眞正病的根源，則不但無助，而且有害胃潰瘍的人，如果祗用止痛的藥去暫時的止痛，而不去注意飲食的改善，結果造成可怖的胃穿孔。蚓突炎（俗名肓腸炎）的病人，祗求止痛，而失去手術的時機，結果造成可怖的腹膜炎。這與飲鴆止渴有什麼不同呢？在我們沒有找到眞正的病源之前，而去自作聰明的吃止痛藥劑，這好比仇友親敵，不但是不智，而且是大愚了。</p>
<p>在人體中間，有少數的臟器在病變的時候，沒有痛的警吿，好比肺，雖然已有肺結核症，而且有了空洞，可是他祗有咳嗽，多痰，消瘦或潮熱，而沒有痛，就爲了沒有痛，所以狠多人不能及早發現，需失去醫治的時機，幸而肺結核還有咳血的警鐘，不過狠多肺結核患者，沒有咳血的，這個時候，我們要恨了，爲什麼不同胃病一樣的早點給我們痛的感覺呢，那時，我們才感到痛的可貴，而悟到痛對於健康保障的眞諦。</p>
<p>有許多痛，不一定說痛的地方，就是病之所在，更有好多病症是痛在同一個部位，那時我們不能用直覺來判斷，還得要求敎高明，用各種檢騐去尋找正確的病源。如急性蚓突炎在剛開始發作的時候，大都胃部先痛，如果拿常例來判斷吧，這該是胃病了，但是，非也，這樣說來，胃部痛了，就該首先想到是蚓突炎了，但是又非也，肋膜炎也可以在胃部作隱痛的。至於下腹部的痛，更有一二十種疾病之可能。我們不能拿普通的常識來武斷，我們要拿科學去區別，才可得到根源。</p>
<p>眞理總是一探的，譬如小孩的哭，也是一種警鐘，很多做母親的祗去抱他哄他，可是有沒有注意到也許小孩的尿布潮了，也許一個小針刺痛了，也許手臂弄痛了呢，不能拿會吵來駡他。小孩的哭有很多的原因，而况十分精細的人體機構，我們怎能當作兒戲來隨便處置。</p>
<p>人體健康的警鐘，除了痛，如發熱，吐血，咳嗽，嘔吐等等都是病的先兆，我們不能忽視而暴棄造物之主給我們健康的警鐘，因此我們要：</p>
<p>診視健康的警鐘。</p>
<p>研究和區別他的因果。</p>
<p>在沒有找到眞正病源之前，不要自己先處置警鐘，如打止痛針之類。</p>
<h3>生物學　製品概說</h3>
<p>— 汪美先</p>
<p>診斷用品類：診斷傷寒（威達氏試驗Wldaletes）及斑疹傷寒（魏斐氏試驗Weil-Felixtest）凝集試驗用的各種細菌菌液Bacterial　Suspension）；檢定細菌種類(Species）及型別（Types）用的各種標準診斷血淸，測定人類對於結核變態反應（Alleergic　Reaction）的舊結核菌素，以及華氏康氏梅毒反應抗原等等。</p>
<p>生物學製品爲傳染病預防及治療上的要品，例如牛痘苗用作預防天花，霍亂疫苗用作預防霍亂，狂犬病疫苗用作預防防——實際上已被瘋狗咬後用作治療，所以有名「治療的預防接種（Curative　Vaccination）」，白喉破舉世公認對症唯一的方法；其中最有辦法而能控制的當推白喉症（Diphtheria），測定人類對於白喉有無感受性（抵抗力），可以施行錫克氏試驗（Schick　test）——用錫克氏試驗毒素，凡遇陽性反應的表示對白喉有感受性，沒有抵抗力，可能被傳染，所以應該預防接種白喉沉澱類毒素（Diphtheria　Alumprecipitated　Toxoid）自動的使其本身產生抵抗力量；如果唯恐被預防接種的人對類毒素反應太大，那麼可以事先施行孟氏試驗（Moloney　test），以測定注射白喉類毒素有無不良反應，當白喉已經流行，上述注射類毒素使自動慢慢的產生抵抗力的方法，已經來不及的時候，應急起見可以注射白喉抗毒素使被動的馬上得到抵抗力，不過這種方法維持時間很短，而且以後注射抗毒素有發生過敏反應（Prophylaxis）的危險，萬一已經感染白喉，可以立刻注射足量的白喉抗毒素，所以站在生物學製品立塲上說對於白喉症是比較有辦法的一種。</p>

<h3>甚麼叫做狹心症？</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>國府委員張繼氏，因患狹心症逝世，有很多的人，對於狹心症的名稱，不甚明瞭，來問我的很多，現在簡單的說明一下。</p>
<p>狹心症發作的狀態</p>
<p>最重要的症狀。就是心臟部的激烈疼痛，似牽引，似穿刺，似壓榨；這樣的疼痛，不但僅僅在心臟部，而且還傳播到左上肢，左肩，左腕，左肘關節，左指端，尤以尺骨側就是小指方面疼痛更甚。當疼痛發作的時候，病人的面色蒼白，脈搏細小，呼吸淺而靜；在行走的時候，即刻停步；在談話的時候，中止談話，變成屛息不聲的狀態。發作的時間，長短不一，短測數秒鐘到數分鐘，也有持續到一小時以上。有時還有嘔吐，下痢，發汗，大小便失禁，尿量增加和紅斑等等。發作的次數，也沒有一定，有的在短時間內反覆發作，也有數週乃至數年發作一次，也有一生僅僅發作一次的。在發作的開始，有忽然發生的，也有先有前驅症候；臂如輕度的胸部壓迫感。上肢牽引，發汗，苦腦等預兆後，再來發作的。狹心症的預發，很難判斷，有多次發作沒有生命的危險，有僅僅一次發作，突然死亡的事情。</p>
<p>為什麼發生狹心症</p>
<p>心臟需要營養，冠狀動脈就是營養心臟的動脈，如果冠狀動脈發生硬化的話，心臟的血行，就會發生一過性的不良，以致發生本症。大動脈有硬化的時候，也一樣可以引起本症，有上述病變的人，遇到了肉體和精神的過勞，皮膚受寒，飽食，房事等等的時候，就可引起本症。至於引起冠狀動脈和大動脈硬化的原因很多：例如體質遺傳，糖尿病，痛風，肥胖症，肉體過勞，精神興奮，過度的吸烟和飲酒及茶，鉛中毒，關節風濕病，傷寒，瘧疾，梅毒等。</p>
<p>狹心症時候的看護</p>
<p>發作的時候，第一要靜臥，在心臟放置微溫濕布或冰袋，四肢用微溫水磨擦，飲以少量之咖啡和葡萄酒；一方面即速請醫師診治。在平時應當節制飲食，毋令過飽，香料烟酒，均應禁止，大便宜通順，减少肉體和精神過勞，都是要注意的。</p>
<h3>一個缺乏甲狀腺之侏儒</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>有一個十三歲半之女孩，因爲先天方面之缺憾，變成深度之發育不全狀態。全身患粘液性水腫。身軀四肢均與應有之長度不符。體重僅有十五基羅而身長亦爲八十一生的米突，蓋道地之侏儒也（見圖一）。此孩之腦力甚爲遲鈍，終日臥床不起，不哭不笑，不言不語。呼之不應，視物無睹。對於一切事物漠不關心。不能行走，亦不能起立。於是送入醫院診治。經過詳細檢査後，認爲係患先天性之甲狀腺缺乏症。蓋其血統方面先有嚴重性之精神病遺傳因素，而其甲狀腺亦無從證實其存在。且其全身骨骼亦完全發育不全，有如方在哺乳期中之嬰孩，其形成骨骼組織之核心亦非常退化。（見圖二）。此小孩之手及臂在愛克司光攝片上，顯示出骨節之糢糊及骨紋之退化。此外其腦門之骨縫亦復仍然開着，並未愈合。腦底之馬鞍狀態。其第五腰脊維及第一盆骨間有破裂狀態（Spina　bifida）血液方面，騐得有普通性貧血，淋巴性白血球有少許增多。血中膽脂（Cholesterin）增加甚多。以粗自其大腿骨內抽出骨髓騐之，則有紅血球形成組織之退化狀態及白血球形成組織之不全狀態。此孩之新陳代謝作用减低百份之三十。一切之腱反射作用增高。兩大姆趾之Babinski氏反射作用亦爲陽</p>
<p>總而言之，此孩之所以成爲侏儒以及全身各部之種種病態，均爲先天性缺乏甲狀腺之症象。於是其主治醫師每日給以甲狀腺素（Thyroxin）0.00003gm五滴，或則每日給以甲狀腺全體素Thyreoglancol半片，有時則兼用維他命乙一素每天三次每次二片）如是者約有一年。此孩之身體竟爾大有改進（見圖三）。已能坐起，手弄玩具。對於週遭事物，亦有感覺。智力方面顯亦改進。以手扶之，竟能走路。全身之粘液性水腫完全消失。那其顏臉方面亦有喜怒哀樂之種種表情。至於骨骼方面，則尤見顯著之進步。以愛克司光攝片證之，則似如五歲大小之小孩骨骼矣（見圖四）。其原來之身長為八十一生的米突，如今則為九十三生的米突半。以前之血色素爲百分之五十八，今則爲八十三。以前之紅血球爲二百七十萬，今則增爲四百零七萬，以後若能繼續應用此種療法，則其身體方面，定必有更大之改進也。（此事見瑞士大學診療醫報及Helvetica之兒科醫報Helvetica　Paediatrcia　Acta（Series　D）2，No．2，154-173（1947年）曾經Franceschetti，F．Bamatter及D．Klein諸醫師著文撿討而爲瑞士羅士醫學文摘所轉載者，事情確鑿，絕非向壁虛造也）。</p>

<h3>記宋哲元　「矮簷」回憶之一</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>自「九一八」事變，東北四省淪陷後，倭氛內逼，氣燄薰天。華北尤其平津，已在嚴牆之下，人民則處於「矮簷」之下。倭人處處搗亂，歷屆當局支撑不易，而宋哲元將軍之冀察政委會，內外交謪，百方應付，眞是「甜酸苦辣」，說不出甚麼滋味來。</p>
<p>日本要他「明朗化」（明朗到殷汝耕偽冀東政府那樣程度），國人亦嫌他不明朗（明朗到黃郛以前谷政委會的樣子）。老宋的主意，對日本不能學「冀東式」的明朗，即以「對中央亦不太明朗」堵堵倭人的嘴。而冀察政委會以「自己明朗自己」的態度，左支右絀，東搪西塞的方法，苦撑了一年零八個月的光陰。（二十四年十二月八日，冀察政委會成立，至二十六年七月七日蘆溝橋開火。）</p>
<p>二十五年一月七日；「冀察」要求一僞冀凍」取消一自治」，交還二十餘縣。「偽冀東」答以「不能」，日本的駐屯軍亦警吿不准壓迫「冀東」。其大使館之磯谷武官且聲明「日本之對華北要求之明朗化，就是完全脫離國府之統治」。這是說「明朗化」的「明朗話」。磯谷就是台兒莊吃敗仗，後做香港偽督的那個家伙！</p>
<p>「冀察」很受「僞冀東」的氣。諸如接收塘沽一帶土地資產，截留平東火車票款，及一切公共稅收等等。「冀察」地盤，本釆小得可憐，（與以前之各政委會管魯晋各省者不同），而一個「冀字又被老殷的冀東」分去「半　江山」，名爲兩省，實際一省都不够。</p>
<p>對日本亦有許多磨擦。如朝陽門事件，豐台事件，聖農園事件，天津省公署日警侵入事件，幾次衝突，「冀察」都以議步了之。雖然讓步，卻已表示「自已明朗」的倔强態度。日方之意，是祗要你不「明朗」到中央一方面，則作爲地方事件，將就了結，尙無不可。其屢　擦而未破裂的原因在此。</p>
<p>後來，平津辦國大選舉，日方一度呌囂，認爲「中央化」，然而他們的惟一心事還不在此「冀東化」以為那樣纔能澈底「明朗」，一切摩擦自然消失於日化之中。</p>
<p>日本堅持日本之所謂「明朗」，逼得老宋由一自已的明朗」而趨向日本所反對的「明朗」。至「七七」事變勃發，老宋終於以事實表明心迹。他眞正的「明朗」了自己？</p>
<p>「冀察」撤陣以後半年，僞「臨時政府」出現，「冀東」還想保留地盤，日方卻不許了，勒令解散歸併，於是「偽明朗」了「冀察」，「僞明朗」了「冀東」。</p>
<p>如是者八年，日本投降，僞府瓦解，中國人「眞正的明朗了華北」！</p>
<h3>睡了一世</h3>
<p>— 羅塔</p>
<p>人生七十古來希，前二十年太少，後二十年太老，中間一段恰好睡覺，睡覺，睡覺，睡掉了一生。</p>
<p>中國人是全世界最善睡，不，應該說是最易睡的民族。你可以在任何角落裘發現打隘睡的同胞，洋人爲了睡覺而發明了彈簧床，席夢思，烏毛被，谿毛枕頭，各種各式睡衣甚至於安眠藥，這在一坐下來不數分鐘就　聲大作的國人看來　在都太多餘，太　床架屋了：電車，戲院，公園，敎室，辦公廳……何處不可睡？我們可以在任何環境裏安然入眠，爲了要睡覺也懶得跟洋人出這　許多花樣。所以我說中國人是最易睡而不說他是最善睡，也就是這個意思了。</p>
<p>十餘年前有個德國學者來中國，住在一家旅館裏被吵得整夜不能入眠，以後寫了一篇文章說：「……我住的一家旅館裏一整夜的呌囂，呼喝，吵駡，還有許多我至今也還弄了淸是什麼聲音，簡直呌人相信有什麼革命立刻就要爆發了。尤其可驚的是別人都睡得好好的，我想中國人的耳朶的構造恐怕有些不同。」雖然至今也還沒有一個解剖家能證明此說，但國人對於睡覺有着一種可驚的環境適應力卻是鐵錚錚的事實。</p>
<p>當然，我不是在這裏歌頌失眠。易睡的確是一種幸福，但中國人由「易睡」而「亂睡」是一個絕大的不幸，它使我們的文化停滯了數百年甚至於數千年。在中國，一個科員永遠是一個科員，一個打字員永遠是一個打字員……因爲他們一下了班不叉馬將就睡覺。兩三個月前在一張外國寄來的報紙上讀到一段英國大盜對於本國當代文壇的批評，說得頭頭是道如數家珍，可知這位强盜先生每次「越貨殺人」滿載而歸後並不是喫飽了飯就打瞌睡，他在盜窟裏有時也看看書，寫寫文章。</p>
<p>古今偉大的科學發明，文學創作，其最初的一個念頭或動機都是由於一刹那間靈感的啓示，當時何嘗以科學家或文學家自居？只不過閑時不亂睡，肯坐下來想一想。如果瓦特坐在開水壺旁邊睡覺，怎會「見　蓋自開，怪求共意」而發明了蒸氣機呢？</p>
<p>何必言「人生七十古來希」？據統計，中國人的壽命不過四十啊！挖去了「中間一段」，前後所剩無幾。我們何嘗有過活潑生動的靑年生活和靜坐沉思的老年生活！不是早就併入「中間」去睡覺了嗎？</p>
<h3>校門何妨大開</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>立法院討論大學法，至大學入學資格中是否應有同等學力問題時，有人說：「根據各方報告，鬧學潮者多係大學一年學生，因此入學試臉必須嚴格，同等學力不能投考大學。」又有人則認爲：「同等學力得以投考大學，此門決不可開，否則將來靠人情入學者必將以此為捷徑。」此二君之言，都使鄙人「殊不滿意」。</p>
<p>「鬧學潮者多係大學一年學生，因此入學試驗必須嚴格，同等學力不能投考大學。」論其不通或通，約與下說相等：「家庭中哭哭鬧者多係新生之嬰兒，因此我人生小孩必須事先嚴防其要哭，凡具有同樣可能啼哭的器官者，不准其出世。」夫學潮與入學試驗之嚴格與否已無關係，因爲最嚴格的考試，也只能做到出點即校長敎授被考起來亦難及格的難題，決不能考得學生不鬧學潮。假如我們出一試題曰：「子路的勇氣勇到能否充日本的自殺飛機駕駛員」，或「伯牛之疾是登革熱抑瘧疾，其臨死之際的熱度幾何脈膊多少呼吸是否急促？」而被考的學生竟能引經據典，對答如流，試問此生之能否不鬧學潮，也有誰敢於保證？至於學潮與考大學的同等學力，更屬風馬牛不相及，蓋他所有的的是學力而非鬧學潮本領。</p>
<p>「同等學大得以投考大學，此門決不可開，否則將來靠人情入學者必將以此爲捷徑」之論，目的旣為國家作育英才，豈有英才越少越好之理？有同等學力投考大學的靑年旣憑「學力」，非靠「人情」。此門何以決不可開？况且按之實際，不但中學畢業憑其文　投考大學的學生因爲學少生多，固多托人情，就是想進舉費較低的小學校的學生，也因為中于國人只知節制這核不知節制生育，其家長也得托人情。須知即使有靑年為想求學而托了人情，當局也總應念其向學心切，只要確有考得及格的學力，就應當把學校之門大開，爲甚麽要褂「學校重地靑年莫入」的虎頭牌呢！</p>
<p>要關緊的門應該是衙門，因為入仕途的往往並無某等能力而專靠人情。惜乎建築衙門的泥水木匠一向玩忽業務，總把大門造得漏一條大縫以便人鑽耳！</p>
<h3>相對</h3>
<p>— 定中</p>
<p>在上海，每逢廢歷初一月半的一夜，街上總有呌賣長錠的聲音。現在窗外就傳來了一迎串的「要　長錠」。我眞不懂，舊習慣何以如此不容易改？而所謂「廢」歷，總沒有「廢」去的希望，大約就與這種「事死」的事有關吧。</p>
<p>本來天下事大都相對，有利必有弊，而有弊亦必有利。就以「死生」這二字講，其輕重得失，似乎也頗難說。孔仲尼可說是最重實際的了，不尙玄談，所以是「子不語怪力亂神」。又說，「未知生，焉知死」。這種注意「活人」而不去諂媚「死人」的實際態度，就這樣數千年來一絲兒不動的支配着中國的政治社會，而成爲儒家。但偏偏人在思想上不能不有理想，因爲現實有時是不能滿足的；於是釋家的思想就滲雜進來，加上了後來西洋文化的輸入，就有人喊打倒孔家店了。釋家最初似乎也是自修自證的，後來不知那一個始作俑者，創始了應酬誦經拜懺，專門去替人超亡度死；就一反儒家的作風，而所謂追求理想，卻變成爲不管「活人」，專管「死人」的局面。於是又遭社會垢病，斥爲迷信。太重「生」旣有缺漏，專重「死」亦弊端立見，「死生」之問如何調勻，倒頗可斟酌的。</p>
<p>近見報載，滬地難民佔住各寄柩听，將棺木搬出後，紛紛遷入，據說楊樹浦一帶遭受佔據的寄柩所有五六處。這倒是一個難目題，顧了「生」就不能顧「死」，顧了「死」亦就不能顧「生」，眞是顧此失彼，頗難兩全。「死人」要緊呢還是「活人」要緊？倘沒有替「死人」打算的寄柩所，難民們亦就無從佔住；本來是替「死人」打算的，現在倒變成替「活人」設法了。</p>
<p>這種相對的例子是不勝枚舉的，我們不是常見「寓禁於徵」的話麼？然則「禁」之與「徵」又什麼分別呢？人是理智的動物，人又是感情的動物，兩說都不錯的。愈想沒有透，而「要　長錠」的聲音又傳來了。</p>
<h3>同學錄</h3>
<p>— 黎里</p>
<p>歲暮天寒，忽然接到了遠從香港寄來的一册同學錄。離開了學校整整八年，離亂頻仍，同學們的消息久已隔膜，難爲那位在香港的同學，居然調査得頗爲詳細，在寒夜凄燈下，我面對這一本小册，不禁棖觸萬端！</p>
<p>我國是講究「同」的國家，所以有「同鄉」，「同年」，「同門」，「同事」等名稱，這「同學」就兼有從前「同年」「同門」二者之意。八年離亂，落拓如故，不禁頗多「同學少年多不賤，五陵　馬　輕肥」之感。小册內榮　「博士」「授」等高銜者總算不少，但　在意的是，這些「博士」「敎授」中，十個有九個在外國，而回來的一個呢，那就同我的境况也差不多了！</p>
<p>更可感慨的是，經過了艱辛的八年，不料同學中死亡的竟這樣多？除了一位在貴陽遭空襲被炸死之外，其他的幾乎全是患肺病死的，連在校時擅打棒球籃球身材魁梧的　　亦　病肺　逝。當一名窮困的公務員，營養不足，生活不安定，常是疾病的主要原因，撫今憶昔，眞堪一哭，難道是我這一班同學身體特別弱，對不起國家嗎？</p>
<p>意外的是，同學中到這個繁華都市來的也漸漸增多，不因同學錄，本來是不知道的。人世間事千變萬化，死的死了，在海外的在海外，留下的這一羣，又有些什麼貢獻？說也慚愧，我似乎已有些中年心情了。</p>
<h3>張溥老絕筆　楓橋夜泊詩</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>蘇州寒山寺以唐代詩人張繼「楓橋夜泊」（月落烏啼霜滿天，江楓漁火對愁眠，姑蘇城外寒山寺，夜半鐘聲到客船。）一絕而馳名，明文徵明曾錄張氏原詩鐫石於寒山寺，以彰勝蹟。其後年久剝蝕，淸光緒末年程雪樓修寒山寺，倩命曲園重書楓橋夜泊詩，樹碑紀念。抗戰後，倭寇旣將寒山寺鐘（唐以前古物）攘奪而去，復將曲園所書之碑石亦移藏他處。勝利後，吳人擬重刻此詩以增舊制，或擬求吳興沈尹默氏書之，獨吳湖帆主請然國元老張溥泉書，蓋溥老之名適與原詩者張繼相同，於是由劉禺生，濮一乘之介，請溥老書之。無如久無音訊，而噩耗傳來，溥老且患中風作古矣。湖帆悵惘殊甚，以爲寒山寺無緣。詎於前日忽得濮一乘函，視之赫然正爲溥老絕筆楓橋夜泊詩也。用筆秀勁，跋稱：「余夙慕寒山寺勝蹟，頻年往來吳門，迄未一遊，海上湖帆先生以余名與唐代題楓橋夜泊詩者相同，囑臀此詩鐫石。惟余名取値久之義，非妄襲詩人也。巾華民國三十六年十二月滄州張繼。」黨國元老中于右任·吳稚暉·李石曾·張靜江諸先生皆以書法著稱於世，而溥老章草在諸先生中又爲自具風標者。國史館以此楓橋夜泊詩旣爲溥老絕筆，欲於鐫石後將原蹟留館以資紀念，聞湖帆已函復濮氏表示同意，是不特爲國家文獻，抑且藝林佳話矣。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第五章　飛來橫禍（二五）</p>
<p>一轉眼間，那位魏大夫，穿了一身雪白衣服出來，渚齊一面向他握手，隨指綺紈說道：「這位是舍親李小姐，在半路翻車，身上受點傷，請你檢查檢查。」魏大夫產引綺紈到屋內，兩個看護婦，帮同檢査一遍，只是臉上和手臂受了皮膚傷，並沒多大關係，立時把臉上手上血汚洗滌消毒，然後敷上藥膏，用綳布包裹停當。渚齋向他要一間病室，攙綺紈到裏而在床上休息。綺紈此時心神稍定，痛也稍止，想起又是一陣傷心，淚落不止。渚齋股勤慰藉道：「你何必這樣看不開！事情已經過去，不必再想了。」綺紈因咽道：「今免若若不見你，我早已投水死了。我實在沒臉活着，不如死了乾凈！」者齋道：「尔不要這樣想呀，今晚除你我之外，沒有第三人知道。我可以發誓，這事無論內容如何，我絕不問不提，更不會對別人露出隻字，你相信我嗎？」綺紈見他說得如此懇切，很是感動，不由緊握渚齋的手說：「在前我祗敬重你，現在我不但感激你，而且……：」說到這句，又咽住了，眼裏淚珠續續流下，渚齋急把西服袋內綺紈在公園贈他那條手絹拿出來，在綺紈臉上，輕輕印一印。綺紈又繼續說道：「我脾氣是很倔强的，想不到今天會栽在別人手裏！」渚齋道：「你不必再想這事了！」綺紈道：「我怎能不想！我一輩子也忘不了今天的恥辱，此仇必報！我恨那姓林的，總有一天和他算賬。」渚齋道：「你何必和這種人一般見識！以你的身份和前途，犯不上和這種人結交。這事不必說了！」綺紈道：「我不說，你也不明白。我不是糊塗人，我爲了排了兩齣古裝的戲，需要添置行頭，這姓林的答應爲我置行頭，我才和他敷衍。我原想利用他，不想卻吃了大虧。」渚齋見她所說和小王媽吿訴的話，完全一樣，足見她爲藝術苦鬥，因環境所迫，沒奈何才採取這種行險僥倖的行爲，心裏又憐惜，又敬重，把綺紈握他的那隻手，緊緊一握。因道：「我明白你的苦心，我很敬重你。你是很純潔的，你爲藝術前途起見，苦心奮鬥，値得欽敬。一切都是社會的罪惡，與你一點不相干。是惡社會造成你的不幸，你才落在這圈套裏。你太可憐了！」。</p>
<h3>東坡肉</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>本市廣西北路天香樓抗菜館，有紅燜「東坡肉」，頗著名。按「東坡肉」之名，由來久矣，淸梁章鉅浪跡續談中，亦有「東坡肉」記載云：今食品中有「東坡肉」之名，蓋調爛煮肉也，隨所在廚子能爲之。或謂不應如此侮東坡，余謂此坡云自取之也，坡公有食猪肉詩云「黃州好猪肉，價賤如糞土，富者不肯吃，貧者不解煮。慢着火，少着水，火候足時他自美，每日起來打一碗，飽得自家君莫管。」東坡謫居黃州之時，窮甚，然因價賤，故尙能每日食肉，時至今日，速冷氣的肚下肉，也要三萬餘元一斤，東坡假使生在今日，即使歡喜吃肉，也休想「每日起來打一碗」了！</p>
<p>繡像重慶評話</p>
<h3>聖蹟圖的面目</h3>
<p>— 白蕪文　龍生畫</p>
<p>如果說重慶在前幾年，是以全國人民的汗與血織成的聖蹟—神聖抗戰圖蹟代表作，在今天，則可以說這代表作不僅黯然褪色，而且已經破爛了。</p>
<p>復員之後，這里留下了一些學校。在最爲難的抗戰時期，學生們雖然吃的充滿了雜質，稗子，糠層和砂的米，然而卻是吃飽了的，發熱量也還可以維持最低體力；雖然點着「亮油壺」在上自習，最低的光綫也還有得見嘉樂紙上油印的講義；破棉襖棉被也還遮得住山城的勁風。今天，學生們吃的是紅召粥湯，一個月的燈　費只够一夜半至兩夜，於是只好不點燈。而衣服，則一個師範學院的學生，祗有百分之三十穿了棉衣，百分之四十是鑽在同學被與睡覺，然而蓋得到甲，就蓋不到乙，每夜扯來扯去，有如正月半舞靑獅子的。</p>
<p>工廠也在復員後留下了許多，他們民族工業家卻天天跑緊急警報，借錢爲工人買米，倘不然，便實行「刧搜工廠」，—搜査自己工廠裏能變錢的工具或東西，賣給舊貨攤。　留下的商店呢，舉一個例：您總記得當年條條馬路上幾乎都有「三六九」湯　麵店吧，大抵卻改爲木器店和磁　店了，—零碎碎地出賣家具和碗碟。</p>
<p>留下的報，更不用提了，有的已三月不發薪，白職工一磅磅地費鉛　雜　一天天　　食。</p>

<h3>The Implementation of Democratic Constitutionalism Begins, the People of the Whole Country Join in Celebration; Cultural Circles in Beijing Hold Celebratory Luncheon</h3>

Attendees included Xian Guang, Gu Zhenggang, Li Weiguo, Xiao Zanyu, Xie Zhengfu, and the heads of various news agencies, including Xiao Tongzi, Chen Bosheng, Liu Qirui, Xu Junwu, and more than 30 others. An industry soiree was held after the meal.</p>
<p>"Our Newspaper's Shenyang Dispatch, 25th" Shenyang is covered in thick clouds today, with rising temperatures and a gentle southern breeze. Ice is melting in the streets, as if in the spring. The entire city is raising flags to celebrate the commencement of constitutional governance.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou Dispatch, 25th] The city of Fuzhou today is fervently celebrating Constitutional Day, with flags flying everywhere to mark the occasion. Representatives from provincial government agencies, schools, and community organizations held a joint commemorative meeting at the Literary Theater at 9 a.m. All Christians in the city prayed for the smooth implementation of constitutional rule at a joyful gathering. The Provincial Broadcasting Station also broadcast a special program tonight to celebrate the implementation of constitutional rule.</p>

<h3>Hong Lanyou Discusses the Prospects for Constitutional Governance: Building the Nation Amidst Suppression is of Even Greater Significance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, spoke to reporters on the 25th about the memories of the Constitutional National Assembly and the prospects for constitutional governance, stating: Today is the date on which the Constitution passed by last year's Constitutional National Assembly comes into effect. From today onwards, our country has begun to enter the grand domain of democratic constitutionalism. Since the Constitution was promulgated by order of the National Government on New Year's Day this year, the government has, on the one hand, suppressed chaos and removed obstacles to constitutional governance, and on the other hand, enacted laws and regulations and devoted itself to preparations for constitutional governance. Now, the National Assembly representatives elected through universal suffrage have reached the statutory number, and the date of the meeting has also been clearly announced. The election of legislative and supervisory members is also being actively handled separately. All preparations for constitutional governance are being accelerated to ensure that this complete democratic constitution can be implemented in accordance with the established track. Hong further stated: When we recall the difficulties of the constitutional drafting work, we are even more aware of the importance of the responsibility of constitutional governance, because constitutional governance is the beginning of political reform in our country and the start of democratic nation-building. First, from today onwards, our country's politics will achieve the great task of 50 years of revolution. Constitutional governance begins today, and saving the country while suppressing chaos to realize constitutional governance makes its significance even greater and its appointment even more arduous. In the future, civil rights will be further developed so that the country gradually protects human rights through the rule of law and seeks unification through constitutional governance. Second, in terms of political construction in the future, the people's representatives elected by the whole country will be the central driving force for political advancement, which will inevitably lead to political clarity. The head of state is elected by the National Assembly, which is composed of the general will of the people, and will inevitably be fair and wise. The policies decided by the legislators directly elected by the people will inevitably reflect the public opinion of the people and be supported by the people and effectively implemented. The supervisory members elected by the provinces will be able to effectively clarify politics. As for the three branches of administration, judiciary, and examination, they will also be supervised by the people and achieve virtuous and capable governance. Third, in terms of the political system, we hope that under the principle of checks and balances, the implementation of national policies can be flexibly applied, and the harmony and cooperation between political parties are essential preconditions for the smooth implementation of nation-building in the future. Fourth, economic policies must be aligned with the interests of all levels and without bias. The new Legislative Yuan will be able to concentrate its will and generate the economic policies implemented throughout the country, seeking to solve the current economic problems. (The Youth Party's Propaganda Minister and prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai's thoughts on constitutional governance are printed on the first column of the second page.)</p>
<h3>Zhou Yide's Speech: Celebrating Our Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th, United Press] On the occasion of China's constitutional rule, US Congressman Zhou Yide stated: "This new constitution is a milestone for China. However, it seems that it will take considerable time for this constitution to achieve its full effect. The Chinese people had planned to implement constitutional democracy in 1937, but it was not achieved due to the Japanese invasion. The Japanese invasion delayed China for a long time, but we must congratulate China on moving forward. The implementation of the constitution can show China's determination to achieve democracy and give people civil rights." He also said: "The Congressional emergency relief appropriation of 18 million US dollars to China will help China's democratic efforts. This appropriation makes the Chinese people understand that the American people are very concerned about them."</p>
<p>Two Movements in the Capital: Defending the Constitution and Defending the Party and Protecting the Law</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] At the beginning of constitutional rule, two opposing movements are unfolding in the capital: one is the movement to defend the constitution, and the other is the movement to defend the party and protect the law. The former was initiated by the candidates nominated by the National Assembly signatories. Because they were not nominated by political parties and were only elected according to the National Assembly Election and Recall Law by submitting 500 signatures, after the State Council passed a supplementary regulation for political party nominations, most of them were Kuomintang members, and they could not be elected due to the supplementary regulation. They had to take the method of withdrawing to protect themselves, and those with fewer votes were dissatisfied with this supplementary regulation, which led to the unfolding of the movement to defend the constitution. The latter was initiated by the National Assembly representatives nominated by the central government. They were the candidates proposed by the central government. Because they were often influenced by local forces or the time was too rushed and preparations were inadequate, they received fewer votes. They also formed a Liaison Association in Beijing. On the morning of the 25th, they appointed a delegation to visit members of the National Government and the Central Standing Committee to state their purpose of obeying the President's telegram, the central government's regulations on party members running for elections, and defending the party and protecting the law. It is learned that all parties replied that the central government would handle matters in accordance with the original plan of the party. The supplementary regulations for political party nominations passed by the State Council take effect on the same day as the National Assembly Election and Recall Law.</p>
<h3>Ma Hongkui Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing: Said to Be Here for a Physical Examination, Plans to Return to Beijing Next Week; Strong Military Strength in Northern Shaanxi, the Overall Situation is Still Stable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Ningxia Chairman General Ma Hongkui, in order to have a physical examination, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the express train attached to the Qiantang at 2:45 p.m. When a reporter visited, it was reported that he would return to Beijing after completing the physical examination and could fly back to Ningxia within the new year. The military strength of the communist bandits in the Northwest is difficult to accurately estimate due to their constant wandering. Their tactics are also to attack where defenses are weak, and their movements are difficult to predict. In general, areas where the bandits have been entrenched in the past are easily infiltrated by them, while areas that have not been entrenched are easier to defend. To eliminate the communist bandits in the Northwest, his personal view is that military affairs are very important at present, but the fundamental is still politics. Ten years ago, during the suppression of the communists in Jiangxi, the Chairman had the instruction of "30% military, 70% politics." This principle still applies today. Therefore, in the Northwest provinces, we should strengthen the organization of the masses and enhance local self-defense forces to cooperate with the actions of the national army. Ningxia has not done enough in this regard, but it has made it difficult for the communist bandits to operate in the province, and even intelligence work is difficult to carry out. During my time in Beijing, the Chairman repeatedly summoned me and instructed me to make great efforts in politics and military affairs. The establishment of the Northwest military affairs is generally still in accordance with the old rules, but adjustments will be made based on the lessons learned in recent days. The various rumors that have been spread in recent days are quite exaggerated. After the victory in Yulin, Shaanxi Province, the overall situation is still stable, and the national army's military strength is very strong. Due to the needs of the environment, I will stay in northern Shaanxi more often in the future to command military affairs, he said.</p>

<h3>Signatories Nominated for National Assembly Representatives: Zhang Lisheng Asks the National Government to Maintain Their Eligibility</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The signatories nominated for National Assembly representatives, in order to oppose the supplementary regulations for political party nominations passed by the State Council, previously petitioned the National Government and the Central Standing Committee and submitted opinions to the National Government. It is learned that the State Council once raised a discussion, but the discussion did not reach a conclusion due to many constraints from all parties. It was decided to hand it over to the Legal System Committee of the Council for review. It is now learned that the review committee has held a meeting, and the results of the review can be submitted to the State Council meeting on the 26th for a final decision. The Legal System Committee's opinions are as follows: A. Those who participate in the nomination of signatories without party affiliation should not be subject to this regulation and should retain their right to be elected. B. If party members who have not been nominated by political parties and then have legal proceedings and are judged by the court to be eligible for election, they are also not subject to this regulation and are granted eligibility for election. Also, Zhang Lisheng, chairman of the election committee, submitted a statement to the National Government based on the facts and asked the government to maintain the right of election of the signatory representatives.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch, 25th] The Pingbao Line officially opened to traffic on the 25th, with one passenger and one freight train departing from each side. The passenger train was missed at Gucheng by 4 p.m. The freight train heading north went to Xushui and turned back due to the tense Communist bandit situation. The military has strengthened its preparations for this. A strong cavalry brigade has opened to Xushui on the afternoon of the 25th and ordered the Road Bureau to be prepared for repairs with the army.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] The Pingbao Line is on the eve of a major war. 50,000 Communist bandits are gathered on the west side of the railway in the area near Xushui Caohe, only a few miles away from the railway. In Yixian, at the Beihedian station, the Communist bandits dug a large traffic trench, which is close to Beihe. Officials believe that a major war is about to break out.

<p>The Remnants of Li Xiannian's Troops Flee to Guidong City in Southern Hunan; Rucheng and Zheng Counties Simultaneously Alert</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Changsha Dispatch, 25th] A tense state has been entered in Guidong City, southern Hunan. The number of bandits fleeing into the city reaches more than 400.

<h3>The Pingjin Reporters' Delegation Returns from Visiting: The Situation in Taiyuan is Extremely Stable; Bunkers are Like Stars, Highways are as Dense as Spiderwebs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch, 25th] The Pingjin reporters who visited the isolated island of Taiyuan have returned to Ping on Christmas Day. According to the reporter's six-day observation, although the national army currently occupies only 30 of the 106 counties and cities in Shanxi Province, due to the implementation of the integration of soldiers and farmers and the organization of mass self-defense in the 16 counties in the central Shanxi plain centered on Taiyuan, bandits have disappeared throughout the area, and the national army's power is becoming increasingly consolidated. The situation in Taiyuan, which is regarded as an isolated island, is extremely stable. Due to the implementation of the civilian economy, most civilians can enjoy the cooperative's low-priced ration of grain, cloth, and salt, and the minimum living standards are worry-free. Bunkers made of foreign cement and reinforced steel bars in the suburbs are as dense as summer stars. A railway around the city has been completed, and another one surrounding the airport will be completed soon. Highways connecting various strategic strongholds are as dense as spiderwebs, with a total length of 600 li. In addition, there are two moats outside the city. Today, Taiyuan can be called the most fortified city in the country. However, people in Taiyuan are watching Yuncheng with a worried gaze, deeply concerned that if Yuncheng falls, southern Shanxi will never be restored. Although Director Yan is 65 years old, his spirit is still very strong. He believes that North China should first seek to consolidate the strongholds of Beiping, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Guihua, Baotou, Taiyuan, Baoding, and Tangshan, and then seek to expand the surface. Regarding the suppression of bandits in the country, he believes that relying solely on military suppression of bandits is like "touching a boat with a boat" and will be difficult to defeat the CCP's political strategy of "overturning a boat with water." Only by using political and economic methods throughout the country to maximize the people's strength can the CCP's mad strategy of "overturning a boat with water" be curbed. In this isolated island, the chimneys of dozens of factories of the Northwest Industrial Corporation are still billowing black smoke, producing large amounts of steel, cement, caustic soda, wool textiles, and paper to exchange for large quantities of raw materials and consumer goods, becoming the blood vessels of this isolated island. All land transportation to and from Taiyuan is cut off, relying only on air transport by air transport teams and China Aviation Corporation. In addition, Director Yan Xishan expressed in Bing that he advocated convening reporters from national newspapers to hold a national affairs discussion meeting.</p>
<h3>The Northern Jiangsu Pacification Conference Ends: Li Moan and Zhang Xuezhong Return to Defense Today</h3>

Zhang Xuezhong, having completed his official duties, is scheduled to return to defense on the morning of the 26th.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Western Liaoning Proceeding: Communist Bandits Attacking Xinlitun Repeatedly Fail; Elite National Army Heads to the Northeast at Full Speed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Panyang Dispatch, 25th] The battle in the northwest Panyang area has been underway in Zhangwu, Xinlitun, and Faku for the past 24 hours. On the Zhangwu front, the bandits captured the outer stronghold of Gaotaizi on the 24th, and fierce fighting took place in the surrounding area on the 25th. On the Faku front, the bandits' 1st Column attacked with the 2nd Division on the 24th, and another unit of bandits attacked the northwest stronghold of Shifosi on the south bank of the Liao River on the 25th, and continued to have reinforcements attacking. On the Xinlitun front, the bandits attacked for a long time from the east, south, and north without success, and changed to a fierce attack from the northwest on the 25th, but still did not succeed. Another group of bandits has been fiercely attacking Xinminxi Baiqibao since the 23rd. The national army retreated after gaining a price. The bandits continued to attack Raoyanghe Station and set fire to it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Tianjin Dispatch, 25th] The situation in the Northeast war is tense. According to observations by authoritative military experts here, the current main attempt of the Communist bandits is still to thoroughly destroy the Yupan Railway, isolate Panyang, and seizing Panyang is a secondary goal. It is learned that the elite national army inside the Customs has been heading to the Customs at full speed, and decisive battles will soon unfold in the Jinxi area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Panmost 25th] The long-brewing Battle of Western Liaoning has vigorously launched in the three regions of Xinmin, Zhangwu, and Xinlitun. The Communist bandits who fled to Zhangkai were head-on by the National Army with heavy casualties for days. The center of the war has now shifted to the Zhangwu suburbs. The bandits besieging Xinlitun pounced on the northwest of the station on the morning of the 24th. The national army responded calmly and concentrated fierce artillery fire and bombarded the bandit army. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and retreated.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] The National Army reinforcements went out of the Pass overnight. When the news came, the morale of the people here was greatly boosted. The National Army on the northern line has launched a mobile sweep of Kaiyuan and Chengling for days. The National Army has successfully met in Zhonggu on the 23rd. There are no large groups of bandits in the Changtuan Kaiyuan area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Beiping, 25th] Zheng Dongguo's flight on the 25th failed. The flight was temporarily stopped due to a malfunction in the aircraft radio station and changed to the 26th.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Economic Suppression of Rebellion, but Don't Forget Production!</h3>
<p>Economic suppression of rebellion is a very attractive term! But the important thing is; economic suppression of rebellion is construction and not destruction, it is increasing production and not reducing production. Otherwise, it will be suppression of rebellion in name, but chaos in reality!</p>
<p>Why? Because food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the four basic necessities of life, and none of them can be obtained without materials. Therefore, only materials are the true needs of the people's livelihood; in other words, only increased production is the greatest goal of national economic policy. This is true in peacetime, and especially so in wartime. What is commonly referred to as poverty, in the final analysis, is the lack of materials. Not to mention raising the living standards of the people, even if we want to maintain the living standards of the people without further lowering them, we must increase production and increase wealth. This is common sense in economics, and it is a principle generally recognized by everyone.</p>
<p>In any country, in any era, the goal of economic policy is originally the same: first is production, second is production, and third is still production! However, the approaches adopted in implementation often vary greatly. But regardless of whether one takes active measures, or chooses passive methods, or follows a roundabout route, or uses a direct approach, it is nothing more than adapting to the time and place, and carefully using them, always with the aim of achieving increased production as the only destination. The direct and active methods have more obvious effects, and the cause and effect are easy to understand, so there is no need to describe them in detail. As for all passive and roundabout methods, because the situation is more complicated, and the techniques seem to be more advanced, they are easily misunderstood by the general public; even those who are in the midst of it, participating in it, are often dazzled and unknowingly lose their original direction, and sometimes even go in the opposite direction, contrary to the original goal of "increasing production."</p>
<p>For example, let's take economic control. Economic control, also known as planned economy, its motivation lies in the obvious goal of increasing production, that is, to plan all kinds of conditions related to production in a comprehensive way, in order to make up for shortcomings, increase efficiency, which is originally very clear. But for the sake of comprehensive planning, in many places, it is necessary to cut the long to make up for the short, and adjust the surplus to help the deficient, in order to make a reasonable distribution. For the sake of making up for shortcomings, in many places, it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons, abandon one and take the other, and implement means of banning, and when it is unavoidable, even to impose restrictions, constraints, suppression, and warnings, in order to carry out the plan thoroughly. From the surface or partial view alone, these seemingly passive methods, with the intention of restriction, seem to run counter to the goal of increasing production, but in fact they abandon the small for the sake of the large, and move the east to make up for the west, what is called waving five strings and watching flying geese, is originally no different from direct assistance and encouragement.</p>
<p>To give a more concrete example: such as banning hoarding and speculation, this is bound to be a serious blow to those in the industry, thereby destroying their financial path and eliminating their business practices (such as the recently banned money exchange groups), which seems to have nothing to do with increasing production. However, if the trend of hoarding is curbed, the black market disappears, prices gradually stabilize, and life is temporarily peaceful, and if the capital of tour guides is returned to production, then it may not be impossible to consider it as an indirect method of increasing production.</p>
<p>Another example is the unified control of finance, the unified control of cotton yarn, the unified control of daily necessities, etc. From the perspective of those who are involved, there will always be some inconvenience and disadvantage, at least in the process of adjustment, the difficulties and losses will inevitably be unavoidable, thus hindering their original operation and production. However, if the unified control is truly appropriate, and the coordination is indeed effective, then after the implementation of the unified control, the effect of its operation and production may very well be strengthened instead. The key lies entirely in whether the unified control is appropriate and effective.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most important economic issue at present is not whether or not to implement unified control, but whether the consequences of these unified controls or regulations can truly contribute to increased production. In other words, under the major premise of increased production, are these means of unified control or regulation necessary? Are they excessive? If there is too much interference, which does not help production, or as a result of excessive restriction, it only leads to reduced material production, factory closures, stagnant freight, smuggling at checkpoints, and economic depression in all industries, thus leading to the first serious consequence of worker unemployment and material shortage, and further causing the second serious consequence of social and economic problems, then these policies may have committed the serious mistake of losing their original direction, which is naturally not the original intention of the state to implement unified control!</p>
<p>We do not wish to re-examine these policies here, but we must solemnly point out that the goal of increasing production must not be ignored in the slightest under any circumstances or in any name. Because modern countries, all their economic facilities and efforts are concentrated on this direction of increasing production. On a large scale, such as the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, MacArthur's policy towards Japan, and the economic cooperation of the United States, Britain and France with Germany, their goals are all to revive the economy and increase production, which is obvious and does not need to be said more. On a small scale, such as the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, Britain's expanded export plan, and Japan's "export to relieve hunger" slogan, is their energy not also focused on reviving the economy and increasing production? Frankly speaking, the only ones in the world who do not want economic revival and increased production are the Communist bandits in our country! They are destroying roads, factories, mines, cities, and rural areas everywhere, as well as destroying fields, destroying houses, burning, killing, looting, and using all means to the extreme. Their only role is to do their best to destroy all production and eliminate all materials, in order to persecute all compatriots in the country without a way out, thereby disrupting the entire Republic of China. From these vicious means, we can increasingly know the importance of earnestly increasing production. Only by earnestly increasing production is it an effective countermeasure against all the destructive means of the Communist bandits; only by earnestly increasing production is it the fundamental method to stabilize people's livelihood and stabilize the national foundation.</p>
<p>Military suppression of rebellion and economic suppression of rebellion are the two major paths to save the critical situation at present. Naturally, they should support each other and advance together, in order to quickly overcome the difficulties and suppress the rebellion. But we must know that these two things are nominally called suppression of rebellion, but the severity and urgency of the means must be distinguished. Because military affairs are inherently destructive, they are rigid and passive. Only by killing the enemy and achieving results, destroying and clearing the area, can complete victory be achieved. Economic affairs, on the other hand, are constructive, they are flexible and active, and even a single hair can move the whole body. When implementing this economic suppression of rebellion plan, in order to make up for shortcomings and kill one to warn a hundred, it is not impossible to adopt considerable compulsory and restrictive means, but it should not be forgotten that the goal is still to increase production rather than reduce production, that the nature is still construction rather than destruction, and that the effect is actually to support the industrial and commercial circles, and should never be to suppress industry and commerce, and regard all industrialists and businessmen as merchants to be killed! Therefore, when implementing economic suppression of rebellion, although severe punishments can be imposed on those who deliberately seek personal gain and engage in corruption, it is ultimately necessary to be considerate of the difficulties of business, comply with public sentiment, in order to reduce their suffering to the minimum, and it is best to avoid unnecessary interference and excessive restrictions. Even the way of implementing suppression of rebellion does not necessarily have to imitate the posture of the military, because after all, the objects of suppression are different, and the power and form used naturally do not have to be completely the same. The most important thing is that in the current economic problems, we want to suppress rebellion, but we definitely do not want to create chaos invisibly!</p>
<p>Why do we say this? Because now many emergency measures seem to be excessively general and severe, resulting in a scene of panic, and many measures such as restricting remittances and tightening money supply are inevitably too strict, and sometimes even violate laws and regulations and common practices, so that finance loses its flexibility, and currency cannot circulate, making goods lose their function of exchange in various places. This method of economic suppression of rebellion, in the short term, may have a temporarily stabilizing effect if it is carried out vigorously, but the situation is prohibitive, and it is like giving up eating because of choking, and over time, it will inevitably lead to a contraction of production, a scarcity of materials, and brewing endless hidden worries for the future. It must be known that the current deposits of commercial firms and shops across the country are less than one-thirtieth of what they were before the war, and 90% of the inflated currency is no longer in the hands of commercial firms and shops. If the reserves are further depleted, the currency becomes less liquid, the banks fail, and the factories stop production, just as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce said that procurement and transportation are stagnated, and goods flow backwards, what are the advantages and disadvantages for the future of commerce and finance? It seems that it is also worth serious discussion. Is the final goal of those who advocate economic suppression of rebellion to create such a phenomenon to show their determination regardless of everything? It is really worthy of the attention of mature strategists. Our view is that increasing production is the only proper way to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood. Whether it is treating the root cause or the symptoms, whether it is strengthening or intensifying, anything that hinders or even contradicts the major premise of increasing production must be quickly improved!</p>
<p>Youth Party Propaganda Minister Wang Shizeng Comments on Constitutional Rule</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] Yesterday (the 25th) was the historic anniversary of the entry into force of the Constitution of the Republic of China. Wang Shizeng, Minister of Propaganda of the Chinese Youth Party, made the following remarks to reporters: "The implementation of the Constitution, apart from the Communist Party, which has other backgrounds and intentions, all Chinese people unanimously express their joy. As far as the content of the Constitution is concerned, it is indeed a progressive and democratic constitution that can take into account both ideals and reality, reconcile the opinions of all parties, and is suitable for China's national conditions and the world trend. The key to how to implement the Constitution effectively and smoothly in the future is, first, that people in the upper echelons of politics and society can develop law-abiding, democratic habits and spirits, abide by the Constitution, practice what they preach, and serve as a model for the people. Secondly, the various political parties can strengthen their organizations, restrain their members, and fully exert the effectiveness of guiding the people and promoting democracy, because democratic politics cannot be separated from the use of political parties. If political parties cannot restrain their members, then having a party is equal to not having a party, and democratic politics cannot be promoted. Especially under the current situation in China, it is even more necessary for all political parties to share the difficulties, abandon small differences and seek common ground, and achieve mutual supervision through coordination, so as to establish a brand new and good example for multi-party democratic politics. Whether the Constitution can be implemented smoothly is quite important in this regard. I believe that people from all parties also feel the same way."</p>
<p>Famous Figures from All Walks of Life in Shanghai Talk About Their Thoughts on Constitutional Rule</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Yesterday was the day when our country implemented the Constitution. Our reporter specially visited well-known people from all walks of life to inquire about their thoughts and hopes. Xi Yushu said: "Constitutional rule is the general hope of the people of our country. In this election, there were some places that could not be held due to objective circumstances, which is a pity. The Constitution was promulgated last year, but it has not been implemented. When I traveled to Taiwan this time, some people in the Provincial Assembly mentioned what kind of freedom they should enjoy under the Constitution, but they did not know that constitutional rule had not yet begun. This kind of misunderstanding can be avoided in the future. Also, the position of the Legislative Yuan is the most important when constitutional government is implemented, because the election of legislators has been postponed, and there is no popularly elected Legislative Yuan at this time. As we said: True constitutional rule must wait until a popularly elected Legislative Yuan exists, which is correct. One thing that is worth mentioning is that the general public's understanding of the Constitution is too little, so the propaganda work for constitutional rule in the future is very important. Also, the local officials in various places do not have enough understanding of the Constitution themselves, and some even do not feel the need for constitutional rule."</p>
<p>In the industrial and commercial circles, Wu Yunchu believes that the articles of the Constitution should be implemented in accordance with the spirit of its constitution in order to be meaningful. Wang Qiyu, a giant in the textile industry, said: "After the implementation of constitutional government, the people should enjoy freedom in body, spirit, and property. However, during the suppression of the rebellion, according to the General Mobilization Law, the government can strictly implement control over everything, which is not without conflict in spirit. But this is a major national plan, so it should be discussed separately. There are still more than three months before the National Congress is convened. I hope that officials and the people can do more research on the Constitution so that the implementation of constitutional government can be a success."</p>

<h3>Free Circulation of Grain, Absolutely No Prohibition of Transportation, Grain Department Management Aims to Understand Dynamics</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] News from the Executive Yuan Information Bureau: According to the Grain Circulation Management Measures, grain in all provinces and cities in the Yangtze River Basin should circulate freely. Those who transport it out of the Yangtze River Estuary to the coastal provinces and regions must be approved by the Grain Department and inspected by the Customs. The application procedure is also extremely simple. All legitimate grain merchants can apply to the Grain Department for purchase and transportation in accordance with the regulations. If government agencies purchase and transport food for employees and the people, they can also freely purchase it after the Grain Department approves it. The aim is to understand and inspect its circulation dynamics, not to prohibit external transportation. Therefore, there is no prohibition of grain transportation. Recently, in order to unblock the source of grain, assist commercial transportation, and improve transportation, the Grain Department has requested the Ministry of Communications to issue an order to its affiliated water and land transportation agencies to prioritize the transportation of rice and grain, and to appropriately reduce transportation costs. As for the grain between provinces, it should originally be done in accordance with the principle of free circulation. If there is any prohibition of grain transportation out of the province, the Grain Department will immediately send a telegram to correct it, so that the surplus and deficiency can be mutually compensated.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The money market is tight again. It is reported that the exchange difference has increased to more than 52 billion. Affected by the current situation, the trend of withdrawing cash and stocking up is increasing. It is difficult for silver houses to cope. Because the price of goods in Shanghai is lower than in Beiping, a large amount of capital is flowing south. The Shanghai exchange rate has reached 210 yuan. Because merchants are mostly carrying cash to the south, there is a severe shortage of large banknotes in the market. The relevant parties are discussing countermeasures. Also, the price of grain in the Beiping market is skyrocketing. Merchants and people are competing to buy and store it. Rice is 19,000 per catty, and a small bag of flour is 880,000, showing an uneasy phenomenon. Other things are still stable.</p>

<h3>Sino-US Air Trade Research, Very Few Finished Products Exported from Our Country to the US</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] After the US Department of Commerce conducted research on the possible development of trade between China and the United States by air, it made a prediction: the freight rate of 65 cents per ton per mile for ordinary goods will not be reduced for a while. It is said that DC/4 cargo planes flying between San Francisco and Shanghai must be calculated at a rate per ton per mile in order to absorb direct operating costs. After airplanes with lower costs are added to the flight, the current freight rate is expected to be reduced. Department officials emphasized that the long-distance freight rate between the two countries is expected to be set at 20 cents per ton per mile. The research on this issue in the current issue of "Foreign Business Opportunities Weekly" shows that the value of goods exported to China by air is 115,279,000 US dollars, while the total value of China's exports to the United States is 60,215,000 US dollars. The report analyzes the trade between the two countries in the first quarter of this year and considers the form and value of the goods. Its conclusion is: the most popular goods exported from China by air are metal minerals, including precious stones and semi-precious stones, textiles (silk and hemp), artwork and fur. The materials transported from the United States to China are more suitable for air transportation. The Ministry of Commerce also put forward the following three major production categories: (1) Machinery and vehicles, (2) Chemical products and related items, (3) Other items. The latter accounts for 85% of the weight of export goods in the first quarter of this year, and 86% of the value. Moreover, the number of manufactured products transported from China to the United States is very small, making it difficult for transport aircraft to load enough goods when returning to the United States from China.</p>

<h3>Constitutional Government Association Held Tea Party Yesterday - Sun Ke Spoke on the Procedures for Implementing the Constitution - Constitutional Provisions Gradually Begin to Take Effect</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] To celebrate the implementation of the constitution and the anniversary of the constitution's enactment, the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association held a tea party at the National Assembly Hall at 3:00 PM on the 25th. Chairman Sun Ke, Vice-Chairmen Xu Chuanlin, and Mo Huijun attended. The hall was decorated like a festive occasion. In his address, Sun Ke stated: "Recalling the past year, we held the National Constitutional Assembly here. Through everyone's efforts over the past year, the Constitution of the Republic of China has officially come into effect today. Over the past year, various parties and members of this association have prepared extensively, but some aspects may not have met our ideals. However, time waits for no one, so we have decided to begin implementation today. Furthermore, we would like to clarify the following: First, regarding the session of the National Assembly, although the announcement of the constitution a year ago did not specify that it would be convened today, the general expectation was that it would be for this day. However, due to various issues such as elections and voting, there have been delays. As of yesterday, the National Government has received election reports covering more than two-thirds of the total, meeting the legal quorum. Therefore, it has been decided that the National Assembly will be convened on March 29th of next year. In the coming three months, we still need to complete various unfinished procedures for implementing the constitution, and the members of this association still have unfinished tasks. Second, although the constitution is being implemented starting today, it does not mean that all 175 articles will take effect simultaneously. Instead, those articles that can take effect immediately will do so. For procedural issues, we will expedite the completion of the procedures. Third, we hope that everyone can understand the significance of implementing the constitution and understand the duties and responsibilities of the people. Only then can the new constitution be effective and allow the people to enjoy long-term stability and peace." Xu Chuanlin stated in his speech that the constitution promulgated on New Year's Day this year is a significant improvement over the constitution promulgated in the 12th year of the Republic (1923). Mo Dehui stated: "Over the past year, the government has prepared for the implementation of the constitution as scheduled. In particular, the efforts of the members of this association to promote constitutional government have completed the tasks of investigation, research, and promotion, enabling the preparatory work to be completed during the period of suppression of the rebellion. However, we still need to seek international sympathy and make concrete efforts to complete democratic politics." Subsequently, Committee Members Duan Jianmin and Wang Huamin delivered speeches. Duan's speech focused on opposition to the supplementary election provisions passed by the State Council, and he stated: "Last year, when we completed the constitution, the people entrusted us with two powers: one to create the constitution and one to implement it. Now, our power to implement the constitution has been deprived, and the original five-year term has also been curtailed. We hope that the government can be worthy of us." Wang Huamin proposed a new suggestion at the meeting, advocating that the association express its attitude to the US Congress in its name to seek foreign aid and become the greatest force for world peace and stability.</p>
<p>Constitutional Government Association's Mission Accomplished - Committee Members Request Reorganization</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association committee members recently expressed that since the implementation of the constitution has begun and the mission has been accomplished, they urgently hope to reorganize the association into a permanent institution. Representatives were previously dispatched to explain their views to various parties. During the association's celebration tea party on the 25th, the committee members again petitioned Chairman Sun Ke and Vice-Chairmen Mo Dehui and Xu Chuanlin. Chairman Sun and others immediately stated that they would make a decision after consulting with each other.</p>

<h3>Truman's Christmas Message - Advocates Aiding European and Asian Peoples to Restore Their Confidence - Pope's Broadcast Expresses Deep Sympathy for China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] On Christmas Eve, President Truman delivered a moving appeal while lighting the Christmas tree at the White House, advocating for aiding the starving people of Europe and Asia to restore hope in their hearts. Only after hope is restored can confidence be rebuilt - confidence in individual dignity and human fellowship. The President also said: "Many of our fellow human beings in Europe and Asia are suffering. This Christmas, many are homeless, impoverished refugees, unable to reunite with their families, with very little joy. We, in this prosperous country, are preparing to celebrate Christmas. If we are indifferent to the unfortunate people abroad, we would be betraying our conscience. Our aid to the less fortunate will restore hope in their hearts. The American people have been moved by the suffering of our fellow human beings abroad due to hunger and cold. Thanks to our efforts, people elsewhere have a hopeful view of the future and will not starve."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 24th] Pope Pius XII, in his Christmas broadcast message, expressed deep sympathy for the suffering currently experienced by China. He said, "Europe and the whole world, including faraway and deeply wounded China, are further away from true peace, complete and certain recovery, and a new order based on principles of justice. Those who sow denial and discord are confident that their day is drawing closer, while friends of peace and promoters of lasting harmony, comparing the spirit of Christ with the distress of today's world, which is far from the spirit of Christ, cannot help but feel deeply saddened. But the true power of Christ can better than anyone understand the meaning of the times we are in. In today's world, where two major forces compete for mastery, hatred has a greater attraction for mankind, and all signs seem to point towards division.

<h3>Christmas in London - Giant Christmas Trees Tower Over Streets - Luxury Goods in Stores Are Snapped Up</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The giant Christmas trees erected in London's public squares, including one in front of St. Paul's Cathedral and another, 48 feet tall, in Trafalgar Square (a gift from Norway), have brought back the festive atmosphere to the streets of London since the morning of the 24th, reminiscent of pre-war holidays.

<h3>Emergency Aid to Europe - US in the Process of Procuring</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Deputy Secretary of State Lovett stated that the reduction in the interim aid amount by Congress will cause Italy, France, and Austria to face severe austerity measures. However, he believes that the supply of food and coal will not be affected. Currently, goods worth $150 million have been designated as aid materials and are being procured. At the same time, US authorities are negotiating with France to ensure that the reduction in aid does not severely affect general economic welfare. As for Italy and Austria, agreements are already in place, so no further negotiations are needed except for some details. Lovett anticipates that everything can be resolved within a few days.</p>

<h3>Greek Queen - May Become Regent</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 24th] After King Paul of Greece's condition worsened, he signed an order today stating that if his condition becomes so serious that he is unable to exercise royal power, Queen Frederica will serve as regent.

<h3>Guerrillas Announce Establishment of New Regime - Greece Asks the US to Expedite Aid - Also Cables the UN to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 24th] A broadcast received from the guerrilla zone here confirms that the "First Provisional Democratic Government of Free Greece" established by the Greek guerrillas has been established, and its first action will be to establish diplomatic relations with friendly governments. The goals of the government also include organizing a powerful army, navy, and air force to resist any foreign aggression and to reorganize the Greek state in a democratic manner. The Secretary-General of the Greek Left-Wing League and Minister of Justice of the new government, Bofilogenis, broadcast that the new government should pay particular attention to developing friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the Balkan democratic countries, and said that due to Anglo-American imperialism in Greece, the new government of General Markos, the guerrilla commander, had no choice but to establish a new government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 24th] In direct response to the announcement by Greek guerrillas of the establishment of a new regime, the Greek government has appealed to the United States for more and faster military aid. Greek Army Minister Stratos and Chief of Staff Yeangis, after holding an emergency meeting with senior cabinet officials, requested US Chargé d'Affaires Rankin and Aid Mission Chief Griswold to increase the number of Greek National Defense Battalions to at least 140, which had previously been approved by the United States. Rankin told reporters that any changes to the Greek military organization must wait until the head of the military delegation, Leaversay, returns to Greece from Washington.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 24th] The Greek government today notified the Secretariat of the United Nations at Success Lake about the establishment of a government by Greek guerrillas. Foreign Minister Tsaldaris stated that the matter would be formally presented to the United Nations organization, as it concerns the United Nations Balkan Committee. Greek government officials believe that the next action will be the recognition of this guerrilla government by the Slavic countries. Military officials believe that the headquarters of the guerrilla government is located in the Grammos Mountains in northern Greece, near the borders of Yugoslavia and Albania. In addition to guerrilla commander-in-chief Markos serving as prime minister, the government includes Kokalis, a former professor at the University of Athens and leader of the 1944 resistance government, former Labor Minister and current Secretary-General of the Left-Wing League Bofilogenis, and Greek Communist Party leader Stirlingkos. The Secretary-General of the Greek Communist Party, Zarkarias, had predicted last week that a guerrilla government would be established soon.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Republican Senator Taft told the New York Daily News today that some Americans have apparently become imperialists. They want the United States to be responsible for global strategic bases in order to secure world peace. Anyone who uses war as a tool to promote policy is an imperialist. There are many who are now talking about war against the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union takes the offensive, we may not be able to avoid it, but every peace-loving person should oppose the use of war as a weapon of foreign policy.</p>

<h3>Recent Economic News from Britain</h3>
<p>-- Ben Geng</p>
<p>[Our London Correspondent] The main point of Britain's economic problem is that the country's production cannot maintain the daily life of its people. As a result, some things, such as food, must rely on "imports," and when most parts of the world are experiencing economic problems, Britain not only needs to "import" but must also buy from so-called "hard currency" countries, mainly the United States. This has caused a continuous drain on Britain's "gold" (unless Britain's exports can exceed imports, but this is currently out of the question). Britain's gold consumption in the last three months is as follows (in millions of pounds):</p>
<p>[Table showing gold consumption figures]</p>
<p>As shown in the table above, Britain consumed 263 million pounds in three months. According to the figures for August this year, at the end of August, Britain's gold reserves were approximately 600 million pounds. If the above-mentioned three months' consumption is deducted, the gold reserves will fall to just over 400 million pounds. However, it is estimated that during these three months, Britain purchased some gold from South Africa, plus new gold from gold mines. The current gold reserves are approximately over 500 million pounds, but the consumption rate is already quite considerable. The sale of these gold reserves is mainly to the United States, with a small portion transferred to Sweden and Switzerland. The reason for this, of course, is to offset the trade deficit caused by necessities. Buying US dollars from the International Monetary Fund is naturally for covering debts. Not only that, during these three months, Britain also used 22 million pounds under the Canadian loan, so the actual consumption for the three months should be 185 million pounds.</p>
<p>This situation certainly did not begin today. Some economists in Britain believe that the main problem is economic policy. As early as July last year, Professor Alan (Prof. R.G.D. Allen) believed that there were problems in the industrial sector. He pointed out that at the time, "war" industries (machinery, hardware, and chemical industries) retained 16% more labor than before the war, while all other industries retained 30% less labor than before the war. This indicates that there are problems with the distribution of labor in British industry. Some also believe that the problem with British economic policy is that "too much money is chasing too few goods," so it is necessary to find ways to reduce everyone's income. Although these discussions have been around since last year, they have attracted more attention this summer due to the increasingly serious depletion of gold reserves.</p>
<p>The main point, according to some, for the problems in Britain lies in inflation (here, inflation refers not only to the simple increase in the amount of currency but also includes credit inflation and the increase in the rate of currency circulation). The social purchasing power has been excessively expanded, and inflation is related to the government's large amount of capital outflow. Recently, Mr. Roy Harrod of Oxford University, in his newly published book discussing the British economic problem (titled "Are There Hardships Necessary?"), believes that the failure to increase exports and balance foreign accounts is only a byproduct of excessive capital expenditure. He advocates that the government can reduce its annual capital expenditure by 500 million pounds (the British government's capital expenditure includes the construction of housing and various facilities for the people). These opinions represent the view that the government should tighten its belt because, in the eyes of some, at least some officials in the British government are advocating for a large amount of capital outflow.</p>
<p>Recently in Britain, judging from the budget discussed by the current parliament, increasing tax rates and raising prices seem to be aimed at reducing the purchasing power of the people, while also increasing government revenue to reduce currency issuance. On the 2nd of this month, the British government released a white paper on capital for 1948, also announcing that capital expenditure in 1948 would be reduced by 20 million pounds compared to the original plan. Generally speaking, if the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Cripps, is any different from the previous Chancellor, Dalton, it seems that Cripps is an even stronger advocate of tightening the belt to solve Britain's economic problems. Therefore, it is likely that the rise in prices in Britain is only just beginning, and the quantity of rationed goods will be further reduced. Last week, Cripps stated in his speech that if production cannot increase by 12% more than it is now, the current allocation of clothing cannot be maintained (currently, the allocation of clothing in Britain is 20 "points" per person in five months, while a suit requires 26 "points").</p>
<p>There are two other points to be mentioned in passing here: First, in last month's British local council elections, the Labor Party suffered some setbacks. Some believe this is because the Labor government has lost the hearts of the people, but in the recent consecutive by-elections for parliamentary seats, the Labor Party has not lost a single seat, suggesting that the people still hope that the Labor Party will continue to test its policies. Second, some with old-fashioned liberal ideas believe that the economy does not need to be regulated and should be allowed to develop naturally, thus opposing the Labor Party's current approach, but this view does not seem to have attracted much attention in Britain. Even the leader of the Conservative Party, Churchill (the wartime British Prime Minister), although he criticized the Labor government in his public speeches, did not completely abandon economic controls.

<h3>Over 30,000 Christians Held Worship Service at the Racecourse</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Curses Strife and Praises Peace</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was Christmas Day. The Christmas Music Worship Service, jointly sponsored by the Chinese Christian Reconstruction Association and the Shanghai Christian Teachers United Committee, was solemnly held at the third grand field of the racecourse yesterday morning at 10 o'clock. Those who attended included church leaders Bishop Jiang Changchuan, Bishop Ward, Pastor Snarfson, Pastor Zhuxinsheng, Pastor Lin Tianduo, and more than 30,000 Christians such as Ding Guitang, Tu Yuqing, Li Zhaohuan, and Zhao Jinqing. The grand occasion was unprecedented. Mayor Wu also attended the service with his wife and three sons and daughters. Christmas trees were arranged around the podium in the center of the lawn. In the middle was an oak cross and an olive tree symbolizing peace. A black velvet table cloth was draped over the table in front, adorned with the three yellow words "Holy. Holy. Holy." On both sides of the podium were the U.S. Navy Band and the sacred music groups of various churches and schools in the city. The sacred music group had more than 200 people, and Professor Ge Chaoshe from the Conservatory of Music conducted the chorus. It was solemn, quiet, and deeply moving.</p>
<p>Not Destruction, But Practice</p>
<p>The meeting was presided over by Zhao Jinqing. After giving a speech, Bishop Jiang Changchuan and Pastor Snarley recited scriptures, and Pastor Xinsheng and Ward gave prayers in Chinese and English. After the congregation sang "New Life Father Song," Mayor Wu delivered a sermon. The mayor listed Jesus's records in the Gospel of Matthew, saying: "I come, not to destroy, but to practice." Although reality is often not as good as the ideal, success is not achieved by random criticism. Some people think that improving reality requires struggle, which violates the spirit of Christ. The improvement of the world needs to start with introspection of the world itself. "Matthew" also said: The Pharisees once asked Jesus Christ which was the most important of the sincere laws. Jesus replied, "Serve God with your whole soul" and "Love your neighbor as yourself." If we always remember this most important commandment, and all actions are clear conscience, clear to God, we will be able to eliminate selfishness and dedicate our lives to universal love and peace, and promote the world to the best possible state. The mayor encouraged the audience to take this as the true meaning of life, curse strife, and praise peace. Subsequently, the Lingdong Church Orchestra played sacred music, Dr. Xiang Lie preached, the United Nations Sacred Music Group sang in chorus, and the Navy held rituals and other construction programs. Finally, the conference adjourned in the blessings of Pastor Zhu Guishen and Pastor Shen Deng. It is also known that when the Joint Committee of the Christian Church held a music worship service yesterday, they donated all the donations from the believers in the field, except for various expenses, to the sick prisoners of the Shanghai Prison for medical purposes.</p>
<p>Singing Hymns in the Detention Center</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Shan Xianlin, the director of the Detention Center of the High Court, is a devout Christian. He uses religious methods to influence the great traitors in the prison. Therefore, the order in the detention center has been exceptionally good recently. Yesterday was Christmas Day. Director Shan gathered more than 100 Christian prisoners among the Han, such as Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Old Men of the Sea," and Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University. He held a service at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. Zhang Tianfu, director of the Personnel Office of the High Court and person in charge of the literary and art work of the institute, also participated. Director Shan led the whole group to sing hymns and pray, and then quoted the Bible to teach the prisoners, briefly describing the principles of being a human being, and it ended at about 11 o'clock.</p>
<p>Ye Zaizhou, Director of the Prison Department of the Judicial Administration Department, went to the High Court Detention Center for inspection at 3 pm yesterday, and inspected the prison cells on each floor. He was very satisfied with the internal facilities.</p>
<p>300 Million Refugee Children Urgently Need Relief</p>
<p>The United Nations Advisory Council for Relief of Refugee Children has nearly 300 million refugee children. This situation is nothing less than a challenge to the conscience of the world. The greatest expression of the spirit of Qiu is the human concern for the same kind, and the highest expression of this concern is that we all want to protect and help the most helpless children of mankind. Jesus Festival has always been a festival for children. Regardless of the race and nationality of the children, all children are helpless, have no right to speak, need people's utmost care, and should be helped urgently.</p>
<p>Price Limit on Banquets Strictly Enforced</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, juvenile police and female police from the police station continued to be dispatched separately to enforce the price limit on banquets and crack down on entertainment venues operating overtime. The general situation was still good. Work started at 7 pm and ended at 2 am.</p>
<p>The Resettlement Fee for Deserter Recruits Should Be Recovered from the Original Guarantor</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of National Defense recently telegraphed various conscription agencies in the city to stipulate whether the recruitment fee and resettlement fee for deserter recruits should be recovered and how to deal with them after recovery. The details are as follows: (1) When a volunteer soldier deserts, the original guarantor should recover his recruitment fee and resettlement fee, and another quota of deserters should be recruited. (2) Soldiers who are legally recruited and have received resettlement subsidies, if they desert, the county and municipal governments may order their family members to return the money, which will be transferred to the county and municipal military service associations. The recruitment of deserters will be handled separately.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Approved Duty-Free Imports of Japanese Reparations Materials</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau previously requested the Ministry of Communications to submit a request to the Executive Yuan, requesting that all Japanese reparations materials be exempt from tax when imported, because the Hai Kang and Hai Zhe ships would go to Japan to transport reparations materials to Shanghai. It has been learned that the China Merchants Bureau has received instructions from the Ministry of Communications that it has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and has been sent to the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs to comply with it.</p>
<p>According to a report on the 25th, the first batch of materials Japan compensated to China was originally scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai in mid-December, but due to lack of ships, it is still piled up in Yokosuka. It is also said that it will not be possible to start shipping until mid-January next year at the earliest. The person in charge of the supervision committee of the Japanese Compensation Committee in Shanghai stated yesterday: The above news does not conform to the fact that the reason why the Japanese compensation materials have not been shipped is not because of the lack of ships, but because the other party's preparation for shipment has not been completed as scheduled. It is said that the China Merchants Bureau has ships that can be transferred to Japan at any time.</p>
<p>Movie Ticket Price Increase Is Not Far Away</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Movie ticket price increases are expected to be implemented on New Year's Day. As early as the beginning of this month, theater operators had applied to the Social Bureau for permission to increase the price by double from the 15th of this month. Later, it was shelved because the Social Bureau had to investigate the business situation of the industry. Recently, due to the approaching end of the year, employees had to be paid double salaries. Foreign film merchants and domestic film merchants in the film industry used this as a reason to send representatives to consult the mayor on the 23rd. The mayor promised to notify the Social Bureau to discuss the adjustment. The chairman of the industry association told reporters: It is imperative to implement the price increase, but the amount of the increase is still to be discussed.</p>
<p>Tong Luqing and Luo Naqi Were Indicted by the High Procuratorate</p>
<p>Tong Luqing, the director of the pseudo-National Business Association and deputy director of the pseudo-Cotton Industry Control Association, and Luo Naqi, the deputy secretary-general of the pseudo-Business Association, have been formally prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being traitors.</p>

<h3>Council Tea Party Hosts Senators from the Democratic and Youth Parties</h3>
<p>The Speaker Outlines the Council's Past Work</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Vice Speaker Xu Jiyu of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a tea party at the Council on Tanggu Road at 10 am yesterday to host the recently selected senators from the Democratic and Youth Parties in the city to welcome them. The senators from the Democratic Socialist Party who attended were Mao Jiahua, Lu Bingkun, Wang Junjian, Gao Junxiang, Jiang Haoran, Zheng Dingjie, Yang Gongmou, Chen Youou, Jiang Fulin, Ni Buwei, He Pinheng, Yan Qingxi, Zheng Wenshu, Jiang Henghao, Jin Wanfan, Zhang Ji and others (16 people), and the senators from the Youth Party who attended were Wang Xingguo, Zheng Shouzhi, Yi Shixian, Yi Kenei, Yang Gongshu, Shen Binzhang, Yin Jiru, Chen Deying, Mei Jiannong, Wang Zonghao, Cui Chonghan, Wang Yuqi, Yang Zhengxin, Jin Junli and others (14 people).</p>
<p>After the senators took their seats, they were first nominated and introduced by Secretary-General Xiang Luquan of the Council. Then, Speaker Pan gave a speech, saying, "Since the central government selected you senators to participate in the work of the people's organization in our city, several senators have notified me to meet with me regularly. I also feel that it is necessary to meet with the senators, so I decided to invite Vice Speaker Xu to make a brief reception today. I am deeply honored that you have taken the time to participate. There are a total of 181 colleagues in this council. Because it is the end of the year and everyone is very busy, they could not all participate today. I and Vice Speaker Xu represent all the colleagues to express our heartfelt welcome to you. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly describe the past situation of this council.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council is legally required to convene a general assembly every three months, and the fourth general assembly has just concluded. The fifth general assembly will be convened in January of the new year. The exact date depends on when the municipal government can complete the re-compiled budget. The main task of the next general assembly is to review the re-compiled budget. In order to assist the work of the general assembly, the implementation has been beneficial and harmless to both the municipal government and this council. However, the central government's interpretation is that it should not be convened at ordinary times, but the city has a large population and numerous government affairs. In order to adapt to the environment, the result of consultation with the municipal government is still that it is necessary to retain it. You can start participating in various committees after the closing of the fifth general assembly. I hope you will participate in the work of various departments according to your interests. Each session of the council has a journal printed. Except for the fourth one, which is still being printed, there are four journals from the Provisional Council to the third general assembly. They are specially distributed to you to understand the general resolutions of this council in the past. This council is a people's organization, and we hope that citizens can deeply understand all its activities. However, due to the limited venue, only senators can introduce a small number of citizens to attend, so a radio station is specially set up so that the whole city can listen.</p>
<p>Secondly, this council has been established for a year and a half. I think you must know a lot about how the outside world criticizes this council and what their views are. I sincerely hope that you can give us your advice, and this council will humbly accept it so as to give play to the functions that a people's organization should have. Today is the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, and it is a coincidence to welcome the senators from the Democratic and Youth Parties. Although the Constitution has been implemented, the citizens' implementation of autonomy is still pending. During this period, we should take on the task of promoting democratic constitutionalism. Now that you senators from the Democratic and Youth Parties are participating in this council, with the joint efforts of all parties, I sincerely hope that our work will be more perfect."</p>
<p>After Speaker Pan finished speaking, Secretary-General Xiang explained the procedures for electing the Supervisory Committee of the Council today. Then, senators Jiang Haoran, Yang Gongshu, and Yi Yaonie from the two parties spoke successively, expressing their willingness to work together with the seniors of the Council, unite sincerely, and complete the mission of building a new Shanghai. They also thanked the Speaker and Vice Speaker.</p>

<h3>Cooperation Association Symposium</h3>
<p>The Records of the Symposium on Factory Cooperation Problems Are Sent to the Social Bureau for Adoption</p>
<p>The Social Bureau will require all factories in the city to organize employee consumer cooperatives from the next year, and will use them as the target of the in-kind distribution system for workers. The Shanghai Branch of the China Cooperation Association held a symposium on the "Organization Problems of Employee Consumer Cooperatives in Shanghai Factories" on the morning of the 24th.

After several hours of discussion, there were detailed discussions on the organization, business, and funding of factory cooperatives. Regarding the naming issue of factory cooperatives, it is advocated: (1) All factories that are organized independently and have fewer than 200 members should be named "Limited (or Unlimited) Liability某地某厂 (or Company) Employee Consumer Cooperative." (2) All factories of the same nature that are jointly organized and have fewer than 200 people should be named "Limited or Unlimited Liability某地某番號某业务各工厂员工消费合作社." (3) All factories of different natures that are jointly organized and have fewer than 200 people should be named "某责任某地某区某番號各工厂员工合作社." Regarding the funding issue, it is advocated that: in addition to the employees of each factory subscribing for shares, the Cooperative Bank should lend as much as possible, and credit lending or mortgage lending should be the main method. The Social Bureau should also order the factory owners to subscribe for promotional shares and withdraw the original employee welfare fund of each factory. It is heard that the association has sorted out the records of the symposium and sent them to the Social Bureau for adoption and implementation.</p>

<h3>A Tragedy Occurred During a Family Visit, the Father Played with a Gun and the Younger Brother Died</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Qihong, 57 years old, a native of Yancheng, lives in a garage at No. 7, Sanyifang, Fanhongdu Road, Xuhui. His wife, Xia Aqiao, remarried Zhao because her husband, Wu Xilin, died early and she had no way to make a living. She also brought "oil bottles" Haibo and Haiyan to Zhao's place. Zhao had no children, so he treated them as his own. Haibo is now 23 years old and serves as a second-class soldier on the Xun 120 boat of the 9th Naval Gunboat Fleet, stationed at the Jiangdi in Paotaiwan, Wusong. His second son, Haiyan, 20 years old, is a worker in a dye factory. The day before yesterday, Haibo came to Shanghai from Wusong to receive his salary and went home to visit his relatives. He wore a pistol and planned to return to the team the next morning. Unexpectedly, at around 9:30 yesterday morning, Haibo's pistol was placed on the table. Zhao saw it by chance. Out of curiosity, he took it and played with it. He didn't know that there were bullets in the barrel. Zhao accidentally turned the button, and with a loud bang, the bullet came out of the barrel and hit Haiyan's abdomen, penetrating his back. He fell to the ground injured. Zhao also fainted when he saw the tragic situation of the accident. After receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately ordered Inspector Meng Ruisheng and others to rush to the scene to investigate and summoned an ambulance to send the two to the Red Cross Hospital. Haiyan died shortly after due to his serious injuries. After Zhao woke up, he was taken to the police station for questioning. As for Haibo, the naval authorities were notified and the gunboat squad leader Yang Yishu was sent to take the gun back for verification.</p>

<h3>Xiangxi Shipping Company Employee Embezzles and is Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yang Huisong, a 24-year-old from Zhejiang, was a cargo escort for the Xiangxi Shipping Company in Changde, Hunan. At the end of October, he was escorting 198 barrels of tung oil (worth 180 million yuan) downstream. Unexpectedly, when the ship reached Hankou, he stole and sold all of it. He then changed his name to Zhou Dehua and, with the help of a friend in Shanghai, opened a room at the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road. He gradually remitted the funds to the China Farmers Bank for storage. After the company discovered this, they reported it to the police bureaus in Changde and Hankou. The Hankou police bureau learned that Yang had secretly arrived in Shanghai and sent a letter to the Shanghai Police Bureau. Director Yu assigned Liu Shaokui, chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to instruct Wu Yongsheng, chief of the Investigation Unit, to investigate. They learned that there were indeed some deposits under the name of Zhou Dehua in the China Farmers Bank, and also that Zhou was Yang's alias, but his address was unknown. Therefore, they sent clerk Wang Bingyuan to guard the bank. At around 10 a.m. yesterday morning, Yang was seen coming to withdraw funds, dressed in a brand-new Western suit and behaving lavishly. They stepped forward and apprehended him, and found 3 million legal tender, a diamond ring, and half an ounce of gold on his person. He was taken to the bureau for interrogation and confessed to stealing and selling the tung oil. After the investigation is completed, he will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Vigilante Killing Case: Gu Weijun Sentenced to Fifteen Years Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Gu Weijun, a vigilante from Xujiahui, was accused of shooting and killing Wang Wanshun, the old boss of the Shunxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory.

Judge Zhu instructed him that he could appeal to the High Court within ten days of receiving the judgment, and then ordered the bailiffs to take the defendant back into custody.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Election Today; Jiang Hao Explains Reason for Voluntarily Withdrawing from the Election</h3>
<p>The city should produce two members of the Supervisory Committee. The City Council will vote today. Yang and Jin are not City Council members, while Jiang and Tao are City Council members. According to the election law, only one of the City Council members can be elected. Therefore, the competition between Jiang and Tao is the most intense. However, Jiang has recently voluntarily withdrawn. According to Mr. Jiang's statement to reporters yesterday, he said that political reform cannot be achieved without establishing the authority of supervision. Moreover, the people's hatred for corrupt officials has reached its peak. Therefore, representing the people to carry out supervisory work should first of all have the enthusiasm and courage to fight. However, due to my limited ability, I am afraid that even if I do something, it will be better to withdraw and give way to more capable people before the election, so as not to fail the public's expectations after being elected.</p>

<h3>"Gift" from Santa Claus to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Dispatch from this Newspaper, 23rd] It is said that foreign wines are taking the lead in the "Christmas Shopping Rush" in Hong Kong these days. On this rare island where foreign exchange shortages have little impact, Christmas gifts can be described as "all-encompassing." The reporter need not elaborate here. However, according to qualified merchants, the purchasing power of Hong Kong people this year is 20% to 30% lower than last year. Some goods on the market are being sold at prices close to cost in order to ease the tight money supply in the market. The turnover of large companies has not exceeded 100,000 yuan per day in the past two or three days, while smaller companies have only earned 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Merchants are frowning over the prospects for next year! Since the Hong Kong government promulgated new regulations for managing banks last week, speculators have gradually felt the pinch. The price of gold has fallen below the 300 yuan mark per tael and continues to fall below 280 yuan. According to foreign observers, "hardly a shadow has run to Taiwan!" for the first tranche of 50 million yuan of Reconstruction Bonds (redeemable after 30 years) issued by the Hong Kong government! Contrary to this bleak scene, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which sells spring lottery tickets to be drawn on January 19 next year, is crowded with people, as if they are crazy. If Santa Claus really has a "gift" to give to Hong Kong, it may be the future first prize of 500,000 yuan! (Special correspondent of this newspaper, Zijian)</p>
<h3>Face Up to Northern Jiangsu, Grasp Abundant Materials, Disdain Meager U.S. Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] The Northern Jiangsu Local Association, in order to rescue Northern Jiangsu, protect the provincial capital and the area around the capital, and cooperate with the suppression of rebellion and mobilization, held a</p>

Important decisions were made on consolidating Northern Jiangsu and eliminating scattered bandits. Representatives from various counties unanimously emphasized the recent dangerous situation in Northern Jiangsu and made painful statements, which can be described as tears in every word, and should arouse the vigilance of the people of the country.</p>
<p>Feng Zhuhou, with his white hair disheveled, and temples full of grey, attended the meeting of the Northern Jiangsu Local Association as a representative of Yancheng. The pain of the fall of his city and the destruction of his family made the old man's eyes glisten.</p>
<p>Everyone listened with trepidation, and felt an unusual heaviness in their hearts. Mr. Feng also</p>
<p>presented specific figures.</p>
<p>He said that everyone is currently focusing on the issue of U.S. aid to China, but let's take a look at the statistics of materials in Northern Jiangsu. Northern Jiangsu can produce 2 million shi of cotton per year, worth 50 million U.S. dollars; 50 million shi of rice, worth 175 million U.S. dollars; 5 million shi of peanuts, worth more than 20 million U.S. dollars; 20 million shi of soybeans, worth 80 million U.S. dollars; 40 million shi of wheat, worth 160 million U.S. dollars; 20 million shi of barley, worth 40 million U.S. dollars; and 8 million shi of salt, worth more than 30 million U.S. dollars. The above annual output is worth more than 550 million U.S. dollars. May I ask, if we can grasp these materials, what kind of loan do we need? Finally, I would like to remind you that</p>
<p>pay attention to the target of the Communist bandits</p>
<p>. The Communist bandits have long shouted the slogan "Northern Jiangsu is the second Yan'an" and believe that Northern Jiangsu is the "Ukraine of China." If we want to save China, we must first rescue Northern Jiangsu...</p>

<h3>Changzhou Butchers Detained for Tax Resistance</h3>

<h3>Journey to Southwestern Shandong</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] I, as a reporter, set off from Jinan on the 15th of this month to inspect southwestern Shandong. Three days before, Mayor Li Xianliang of Qingdao came to Jinan to慰勞 the troops. We had a deep conversation one night, which helped me understand the current situation in eastern Shandong. Since then, I have traveled all over Tai'an, Yanzhou, Qufu, Tengxian, Lincheng, Xuzhou, and Pukou, and once detoured to Jining and Zaozhuang. Wherever I went, I traveled nearly two thousand miles, and I experienced hardships. Now, I will choose the main points to report to the readers of this newspaper. Except for the north bank of the Yellow River, Jinan, Qingdao, Yanzhou, and LinYi are the</p>
<p>four strategic strongholds</p>
<p>of Shandong, [illegible character] the four supports of a great building. With Jinan as the center, west to Dong'a, south to Tai'an, and east via Zhangdian, Zibo to Weixian Fangzi, the west section of Jiaoji on both sides has always been in the hands of the national army under the direct command of Commander Wang Yaowu for more than five months. The Gomik, Jiaoxian, and Shandong Peninsula's Changyi, Pingdu, Yexian, Zhaoyuan, Huangxian, Penglai, [illegible characters], Muping, and even Weihai City, were [illegible character] because the national army's regular army was gradually transferred south to the Dabie Mountains, and had to automatically abandon them one after another. Under the same circumstances, the counties west of the river in southwestern Shandong, except for Heze, Shanxian, Jinxiang, and Yutai, the remaining [illegible character] city, etc., although have been under the pressure and trampling of the Communist bandits in countless tug-of-war, the Zhucheng and Juxian in southeastern Shandong, and even Feixian, have also been forcibly taken away by the bandits recently (45 counties and two ordinary cities in the 107 counties and three ordinary cities in Shandong are currently under the control of the national army), however, [illegible character] because the strategic strongholds of Qingdao and Jiaodong, Longkou, Yantai, Weihai, coastal villages along the coast, and Liugong Island, Laiyang, Haiyang, and Jimo are still in the hands of the national army (especially important are the important ports along the coast). [illegible character] because Jining, Tengxian, Qufu, etc., which are strategic strongholds on the periphery of Yanzhou, are always under the control of the national army. [illegible character] because Tancheng, Rizhao, and Shijiusuo, which are strategic strongholds on the periphery of Linyi, are still guarded by the national army. Although the Communist bandits can</p>
<p>take some small advantage</p>
<p>for a while, as long as the Shandong local team is formally established, the Shandong Communist bandits will still not be able to escape the tragic fate of their destruction.</p>
<p>The city defense works in Jinan are being actively strengthened. The outer periphery of Qingdao, from Chengyang via Jimo, Laoshan to the coast, has long had a permanent fortification praised by foreigners as an "iron city", which was completed this summer. Yanzhou was besieged by bandits for more than 20 months. Although it benefited from the isolated and bitter defense of Wu Huawen's troops, its strong fortifications should not be ignored. Linyi was originally the political, military, and economic center of the Shandong Communists. Its city defense works were originally the worst, because the Communist bandits never paid attention to building fortifications. However, since the national army recovered from this year's March, under the personal design and supervision of Commissioner Wang Hongjiu of the third administrative district of Shandong, since this year's May, every day</p>
<p>mobilized five thousand workers</p>
<p>consumed more than one million man-days and more than 3.5 million dan of lime. By the beginning of this month, it has been formally completed. The circumference of the entire city is 4,338 meters, the height is 8.9 meters, the thickness is 4 meters, the height of the [illegible character] is 1.9 meters, the thickness is 0.9 meters, and the city wall is surrounded by [illegible characters]. Every 1.2 meters on the wall has a shooting hole, and every 7.8 meters has a machine gun shooting position. There are three city gate towers, two inside and outside the west gate, and one south gate, with attached artillery observers. Tancheng has 150,000, and Linyi has 300,000, totaling more than one million. The increase in refugees makes us happy and afraid. We are happy that the Communist bandits are brutal and unpopular, so the people run to the government's area. We are afraid that the refugees themselves are also a "burden" to the government, which is adding an unparalleled heavy burden to the government.</p>
<p>This year, the common disasters in Shandong Province are drought [illegible character] and war. In addition to these, there are also so-called floods and typhoons in western and southern Shandong. Among them, Jining and Linyi have been most severely affected. The flood in Linyi is unprecedented in 20 years. This year, no grain was harvested. The people cannot even make pancakes with sorghum. From now on, most of them have been forced to cook sweet potato stems and eat them. In addition to staple food, fuel has become the most serious problem in Linyi. In the spring and summer of this year, 300,000 troops and more than 20,000 horses passed through the city, which not only made</p>
<p>thirty miles around the city</p>
<p>devoid of grass and trees, but even the wood of the coffins was dug up to burn as firewood. Because the horses did not have enough feed to eat, they even ate the tails of other horses. In addition, there are enlistments, requisitions, military food, security food, conscription測所 and 指探所. In addition, there are arsenals and repair shops in the city. Therefore, Peng Guodong, director of the southwest administration of the Shandong provincial government, said well: The city defense works of Linyi are excellent and can be called the Maginot Line of the East. The timely establishment of this core fortification in the Yimeng Mountains can save troops and prevent the Communist bandits from returning and rebuilding their base in the Yiyan Mountains, which is related to the safety of the entire central and southern Shandong.</p>
<p>But it is precisely because of the solid establishment of the above-mentioned city defenses that, before the fortification of the township 保据点 and the local teams are generally established, the people in various places have voluntarily fled to the above-mentioned places. According to official estimates, 山东</p>
<p>refugees displaced inside and outside the province</p>
<p>originally numbered about 7 million. Now, after removing half of them who have resumed their business and returned home, and a quarter of them who have been tragically killed by the Communist bandits or starved to death due to the war in Jiaodong, central Shandong and southwestern Shandong, the rest, except for those displaced outside the province who are not included, only the larger towns within the province have statistical figures, such as Jinan with 70,000, Weixian County with 50,000, Qingdao with 250,000, Yantai with 60,000, Longkou with 60,000, Liugong Island with 30,000, Jining抽丁. The problem of the common people is no longer a painful problem, but a problem of survival. Therefore, it has caused a大 [illegible character] "famine" and "exodus" of the people in the area. In fact, it is also a problem of "escaping death." The cowardly ones could not bear [illegible character] starvation, and mostly committed suicide individually or even [illegible character] family suicide. Some, in order not to escape and die, also returned to the bandit area at all costs to be killed by the bandits. All these situations have reached the most tragic extent that is "eat children and analyze the corpse to [illegible character]." (Special correspondent of this newspaper, Li Tian)</p>

<h3>There is no Shortage of Rice Supply in this City; Rice Price Fluctuations Will Soon be Stabilized; Citywide Rationing is Being Carefully Planned</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The recent rice price fluctuations have greatly affected the lives of middle and lower-class citizens. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that there is no need to worry about the future rice supply in this city. After the end of UNRRA, there will be 20,000 tons of grain, of which 10,000 tons will be allocated to charitable relief organizations and 10,000 tons will be handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for distribution. Shanghai can be allocated a portion. The United States has allocated 125,000 tons of surplus relief supplies to our country, which will be distributed in five cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Sui. The first batch of 20,000 tons will arrive in January next year. The city will establish a committee for the distribution of US relief supplies. Before all the members of the committee are appointed, Mayor Wu has instructed the Civil Food Allocation Committee to handle the business temporarily. The grain purchased by China from the world grain market has already shipped 4,000 tons to Shanghai, and another 40,000 tons will arrive in January next year. The supply of this grain to Shanghai will greatly help stabilize rice prices in Shanghai. Director Wu also stated that because the Civil Food Allocation Committee has a heavy responsibility in the future, he will ask the mayor to reorganize it in order to shoulder the important responsibility of allocating food to the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of a citywide rice rationing system, Director Wu said that this is the trend, but it is still waiting to be discussed and decided.</p>
<p>[Another report] Since the establishment of the Civil Food Adjustment Committee, the rationing work has begun. According to the person in charge of the Civil Food Adjustment Committee, the monthly rice ration in this city is 200,900 shi, with 22,000 shi for public education personnel and 187,900 shi for workers, students, and the poor. After the rice from the US relief supplies arrives, it will also participate in the rationing, and the amount will be set at 200,900 shi. Together with the existing ration, the total will be increased to 418,800 shi. Based on a population of 4.4 million in this city, the average monthly rice ration per person is 1.5 dou, requiring a total of 660,000 shi per month. With the exception of 418,800 shi, there is a shortage of only 242,200 shi. There is a difference of about 8,000 shi per day, but the average daily arrival of rice in the north and south cities is 15,000 shi, totaling more than 400,000 shi per month, which is still 200,000 shi more. Flour is not included in this, and this city can produce 450,000 bags of flour per month. At 2.5 bags per shi of rice, this is equivalent to 220,000 shi of rice. Even if there is no rice grain in the market, there is no problem with the rice supply in this city, and there is no need to panic.</p>
<h3>The Stock Market is Prosperous; Closing Prices are Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua stock market was bullish due to news that the shorts had Yong Sha chips. Major players in the industry wanted to catch them before they got away, so they sold at high prices, and there was inevitably a pullback in the middle. However, small stocks were still profitable. The securities firms worked together, and the closing prices were firm again.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, it was found that Yong Sha opened at 505 yuan and 515 yuan. After the opening, it was handed over and the election saw 513 yuan.

<h3>Investment in Production Enterprises by Money Shops Should Be Handled in Accordance with Banking Law; Securities Trading Should Not Exceed Limits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the investment in production enterprises by banks and money shops, as well as the trading of marketable securities, and trust companies concurrently operating commercial or savings bank businesses, all should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law. It is recently interpreted by the Ministry of Finance as follows: "Upon investigation, when banks and money shops invest in production enterprises as limited liability shareholders, they should be handled in accordance with Article 20 of the Company Law and Article 11 of the Ministry's promulgated Measures for the Management of Banks, which was previously issued by the Ministry on October 14 of the 35th year (1946), with order number 京錢庚三字第三一三一, for compliance.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation and implementation of the Banking Law, the Ministry's previously promulgated Measures for the Management of Banks have been abolished by order, and all banks and money shops should comply with the provisions of the Banking Law when investing in production enterprises. However, before various banks adjust their business and determine their nature in accordance with the law, the investment limit should be temporarily based on Article 53 of the Banking Law (investment limit for commercial banks). (The purchase price of stocks in each company should not exceed 2% of its total deposits, and the total amount should not exceed 20% of its total deposits.) As for the investment limit for provincial and county banks, it should be temporarily based on Article 63 of the Banking Law (investment limit for industrial banks).</p>
<p>All of the above-mentioned banks, if their previous investments have exceeded the limit, should adjust them within one year. Furthermore, banks and money shops handling investment in production enterprises and trading marketable securities should strictly differentiate them in accordance with Article 50, paragraphs 7 and 8, and Article 59, paragraphs 5 and 7, of the Banking Law (i.e., trading marketable securities should not be mixed with purchasing company stocks).</p>
<p>Their accounting treatment should be in accordance with the unified accounting system for banks, with separate accounts established and no confusion allowed. Furthermore, upon investigation, trust companies concurrently operating commercial or savings bank businesses before the implementation of the Banking Law should strictly differentiate the commercial or savings bank portions they operate in accordance with Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Banking Law and handle them in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 of the Banking Law.</p>
<h3>Money Market Continues to Ease</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market continued to ease, with interest rates at two jiao four fen. The net inflow for the four banks and two bureaus was 74.9 billion, with the Central Bank receiving 252 billion, large exchange outflowing 3.2 billion, small exchange outflowing 71.7 billion, the Bank of China outflowing 158.9 billion, the Bank of Communications outflowing 14.8 billion, and other banks and bureaus having more outflows than inflows.</p>
<h3>Severe Coal Shortage in Qingdao; Textile and Construction Factories Completely Shut Down; Shu Yunzhang Issues Emergency Appeal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of the China Textile and Construction Corporation, yesterday issued an emergency appeal to the media regarding the serious situation of the shutdown of various yarn factories in Qingdao under the corporation, hoping that the relevant authorities of the central government would provide a reasonable solution as soon as possible. According to him, the various yarn factories in Qingdao under the corporation have a total of about 350,000 spindles. However, since the 28th of last month, due to the shortage of coal, most of them have been shut down. The factories took turns to operate, with only 80,000 spindles operating per day. Later, with only 2,000 tons of coal arriving, all the existing coal was used up by the 22nd of this month, resulting in the complete shutdown of yarn spindles in various factories. Currently, there are more than 20,000 workers and more than 1,000 staff members in various factories in Qingdao. During the shutdown period, half-pay must be paid, with monthly expenses of more than 30 billion yuan. Furthermore, the influx of refugees in Qingdao has affected local public security. However, the coal shortage problem is not absolutely unsolvable, and it can be solved by borrowing coal. The corporation is also in contact with the national banks, hoping to export 5,000 bales of yarn produced by the factories in Qingdao in exchange for 50,000 tons of Indian coal. Indian coal has strong heat, and this amount of coal is sufficient for the factories in Qingdao for six months. Within six months, the factories in Qingdao can produce 90,000 bales of yarn of various counts, excluding 5,000 bales for coal exchange, 20% of the yarn will be exported, totaling 15,000 bales. Therefore, we hope that the relevant authorities will weigh the pros and cons and find a reasonable solution for the coal needed for production enterprises as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Appeal Filed by Interested Parties in the Case of Forced Exchange of Privately Held Silver; Seven Reasons Listed to Request the Return of the Original Silver</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of the forced exchange of privately held silver that occurred in this city a month ago, it is heard that the interested parties in the case have had a letter of appeal drafted by lawyer Zhou Yizhi, listing seven reasons to request the Central Bank to return the exchanged silver. The main points of the reasons are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The method of issuing legal tender (法幣) announced and implemented by the Ministry of Finance on November 3, 1935, is no longer compatible with the current domestic and international economic environment. The method is not as permanent as other laws and regulations. Moreover, the value of the legal tender itself was equal to silver coins at that time. Now, the legal tender has devalued excessively. At that time, 100 yuan of legal tender was equivalent to 29 and a half US dollars. Now, even according to the exchange rate listed by the National Bank, the market value is only a little more than one cent of a US dollar. Therefore, the old method cannot be applied.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned disposition of the Central Bank claims to be in accordance with the Measures for Exchanging Silver Coins and Silver into Legal Tender announced by the Ministry of Finance on September 23, 1943. However, this decree is an administrative order of an administrative organ, not a law, and should be revised or abolished by the competent department at any time according to the actual situation and economic changes to suit the current situation.</p>
<p>The fines and forfeitures imposed by the National Government have been increased to 1,000 times the original amount. As for the government's collection of land tax, taking Shanghai as an example, including advance payments, the total amount is more than 30,000 times the pre-war amount. Bank deposits before the war have also been repaid at twice the amount. Only the forced exchange of silver must refer to the old law of twelve years ago, which is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Articles 1, 4, and 6 of the Regulations on Punishing Those Who Hinder National Currency promulgated and implemented by the National Government on October 18, 1943, emphasize the punishment of those who intend to profit or smuggle, as well as those who counterfeit, alter, or destroy. It has been clearly stipulated. There is no explicit punishment for mere storage. Even in terms of the spirit of the regulations on the control of gold promulgated by the government this year, it is indicated that the special possession of gold and silver is not illegal. Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Finance's reply to the Kaifeng telegram number 21951, those who collect silver coins without the intention of selling them for profit are not subject to confiscation.</p>
<p>The government has never announced that silver will be nationalized. Storing silver is not illegal, and silver shops are allowed to sell silver items, but the public is not allowed to store it, which is not fair.</p>
<p>According to Articles 12 and 13 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery promulgated by the National Government on December 8, 1945, it is a supplementary method for rescuing economic changes in time between people to maintain the principle of fairness. However, the method between the government and the people is obviously unfair.</p>
<p>After the war, the people of our country have suffered greatly, and their vitality has not recovered. They need stability and conservation policies. Now, this unfavorable treatment of silver storage makes the people who have a little silver feel cold and causes social unrest. Before the victory, Chongqing heavily deducted 40% from gold savings, which greatly discredited the government. This can be taken as a lesson.</p>

<h3>The Alarm Bell of Health—Pain</h3>
<p>— Su Fu</p>
<p>The Christmas bells are ringing in the church, telling us that all those who believe in Jesus should go to worship. The air raid siren is ringing in the trees. It tells us that we should escape to the air raid shelter. All bells are a kind of report, some with joy, some with fear. In our human body, there are also alarm bells, warning us that a certain organ is beginning to become diseased, and we should pay attention to it and treat it. The most common of these alarm bells is pain.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, one of the greatest troubles in life is pain. Whether it is a hero or a good man, there is always a limit to the endurance of pain. No one is not afraid of pain, and no one likes pain. Pain is the enemy of mankind and the enemy of health. But I say that pain is the savior of the human body and the guarantee of health, because it is pain that makes us pay attention and seek treatment early. Pain is not a disease, it is just a harbinger of disease. In medical terms, this should be a symptom. On the surface, it is a malicious attack, but in reality, it is a well-intentioned warning. If we only pay attention to the superficial pain and try to stop it, while ignoring the real root cause of the disease, it will not only be unhelpful, but also harmful. If a person with a gastric ulcer only uses painkillers to temporarily relieve the pain, without paying attention to improving their diet, the result will be a terrible stomach perforation. A patient with appendicitis only seeks pain relief and misses the opportunity for surgery, resulting in a terrible peritonitis. What is the difference between this and quenching thirst with poison? Before we find the real source of the disease, if we eat painkillers in a self-righteous way, it is like treating enemies as friends and friends as enemies. It is not only unwise, but also extremely foolish.</p>
<p>In the human body, there are a few organs that do not have pain as a warning when they become diseased, such as the lungs. Although there is already pulmonary tuberculosis, and there are cavities, they only have cough, excessive phlegm, emaciation, or night sweats, but no pain. Because there is no pain, many people cannot discover it early and lose the opportunity for treatment. Fortunately, pulmonary tuberculosis also has the alarm bell of coughing up blood. However, many tuberculosis patients do not cough up blood. At this time, we should hate it. Why not give us the feeling of pain earlier, like a stomach disease? Only then do we realize the value of pain and realize the true meaning of pain for health protection.</p>
<p>There are many pains that do not necessarily mean that the place where the pain is located is the location of the disease. There are also many diseases that cause pain in the same area. At that time, we cannot use intuition to judge. We still have to ask for advice from experts and use various tests to find the correct source of the disease. For example, when acute appendicitis first starts, most of the pain is in the stomach. If we judge it by routine, it should be a stomach disease. However, it is not. In this way, if there is stomach pain, we should first think of appendicitis, but it is also not. Pleurisy can also cause dull pain in the stomach. As for the pain in the lower abdomen, there are even twenty or thirty possible diseases. We cannot make arbitrary judgments with ordinary common sense. We must use science to distinguish them in order to get to the root.</p>
<p>Truth is always worth exploring. For example, a child's cry is also an alarm bell. Many mothers only hug and coax them. But have they noticed that maybe the child's diaper is wet, maybe a small needle is pricking them, or maybe their arm is hurting? We cannot scold them for crying. There are many reasons for a child's cry, not to mention the very delicate human body structure. How can we treat it as a child's play and dispose of it casually?</p>
<p>In addition to pain, other alarm bells for human health, such as fever, vomiting blood, coughing, vomiting, etc., are all harbingers of disease. We cannot ignore and abandon the alarm bells of health that the Creator has given us. Therefore, we must:</p>
<p>Examine the alarm bells of health.</p>
<p>Study and distinguish its cause and effect.</p>
<p>Before finding the real source of the disease, do not treat the alarm bell yourself, such as giving painkillers.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Biological Products</h3>
<p>— Wang Meixian</p>
<p>Diagnostic products: Bacterial suspensions for agglutination tests for diagnosing typhoid fever (Widal test) and typhus (Weil-Felix test); various standard diagnostic serums for identifying bacterial species and types; old tuberculin for measuring human allergic reactions to tuberculosis; and Wassermann test antigens for syphilis, etc.</p>
<p>Biological products are essential for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. For example, cowpox vaccine is used to prevent smallpox, cholera vaccine is used to prevent cholera, and rabies vaccine is used to prevent—actually, it is used for treatment after being bitten by a rabid dog, so it is called "curative vaccination." Diphtheria is universally recognized as the only effective method for treating the disease. Among them, diphtheria is the most effective and controllable. Determining whether humans are susceptible to diphtheria (resistance) can be done by performing the Schick test—using Schick test toxin. A positive reaction indicates susceptibility to diphtheria and no resistance, which means that the individual can be infected. Therefore, diphtheria alum-precipitated toxoid should be preventively injected to automatically generate resistance. If there is concern that the person being preventively injected may have too strong a reaction to the toxoid, the Moloney test can be performed in advance to determine whether there will be adverse reactions to the injection of diphtheria toxoid. When diphtheria has already spread, the above-mentioned method of injecting toxoid to automatically and slowly generate resistance is too late. For emergency, diphtheria antitoxin can be injected to passively obtain resistance immediately. However, this method lasts for a very short time, and there is a risk of allergic reactions (prophylaxis) after injecting antitoxin in the future. If diphtheria has already been infected, an adequate amount of diphtheria antitoxin can be injected immediately. Therefore, from the perspective of biological products, diphtheria is a relatively manageable disease.</p>

<h3>What is Angina Pectoris?</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Ji, a member of the National Government, passed away due to angina pectoris. Many people do not understand the name angina pectoris very well. Many people come to ask me, so I will briefly explain it now.</p>
<p>The State of Angina Pectoris Attack</p>
<p>The most important symptom is severe pain in the heart, similar to traction, puncture, and squeezing. This pain is not only in the heart but also spreads to the left upper limb, left shoulder, left wrist, left elbow joint, and left fingertip, especially on the ulnar side, which is the little finger side, the pain is even worse. When the pain occurs, the patient's face is pale, the pulse is weak, and the breathing is shallow and quiet. When walking, they stop immediately; when talking, they stop talking and become silent. The duration of the attack varies. It can last from a few seconds to a few minutes, or even more than an hour. Sometimes there is also vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, incontinence of urine and feces, increased urine output, and erythema. The number of attacks is also not fixed. Some people have repeated attacks in a short period of time, while others have one attack every few weeks or even years. Some people only have one attack in their lifetime. At the beginning of the attack, there are sudden occurrences, and there are also prodromal symptoms; such as a mild chest tightness. After the arm is pulled, sweating, and suffering, the attack comes again. The prognosis of angina pectoris is difficult to judge. There are many attacks without danger to life, and there are also cases of sudden death with only one attack.</p>
<p>Why Angina Pectoris Occurs</p>
<p>The heart needs nutrition. The coronary arteries are the arteries that nourish the heart. If the coronary arteries become hardened, the blood flow to the heart will be transiently poor, resulting in this disease. When the aorta is hardened, it can also cause this disease. People with the above-mentioned lesions may experience physical and mental fatigue, cold skin, satiety, sexual intercourse, etc., which can cause this disease. As for the causes of coronary artery and aortic hardening, there are many: such as genetic predisposition, diabetes, gout, obesity, physical fatigue, mental excitement, excessive smoking and drinking of alcohol and tea, lead poisoning, articular rheumatism, typhoid fever, malaria, syphilis, etc.</p>
<p>Nursing Care During Angina Pectoris</p>
<p>During the attack, the first thing to do is to rest quietly in bed. Place a slightly warm wet cloth or ice pack on the heart. Rub the limbs with lukewarm water. Drink a small amount of coffee and wine. At the same time, immediately ask a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. In normal times, diet should be moderate, not too full. Spices, cigarettes, and alcohol should all be prohibited. Bowel movements should be smooth, and physical and mental fatigue should be reduced. These are all things to pay attention to.</p>
<h3>A Dwarf Lacking a Thyroid Gland</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>There is a thirteen-and-a-half-year-old girl who has become severely underdeveloped due to congenital defects. She suffers from myxedema throughout her body. Her body and limbs are not in line with the length they should have. She weighs only fifteen kilograms and is only eighty-one centimeters tall, making her a true dwarf (see Figure 1). This child's mental capacity is very slow. She lies in bed all day long, neither crying nor laughing, neither speaking nor making a sound. She does not respond when called and does not see when looking at things. She is indifferent to everything. She cannot walk or stand up. So, she was sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. After detailed examination, it was considered that she was suffering from congenital thyroid deficiency. Her bloodline has a severe genetic factor for mental illness, and her thyroid gland cannot be confirmed to exist. Moreover, her whole body's bones are also completely underdeveloped, like an infant in the breastfeeding period. The core of the bone tissue that forms is also very degenerate (see Figure 2). This child's hand and arm X-rays show the blurring of the bone joints and the degeneration of the bone lines. In addition, the bone sutures of her fontanelle are still open and have not healed. The saddle condition at the base of the brain. There is a rupture between the fifth lumbar vertebra and the first pelvic bone (Spina bifida). In terms of blood, it was found that she had common anemia, and there was a slight increase in lymphatic leukocytes. Cholesterol in the blood increased significantly. When bone marrow was extracted from her thigh bone for examination, there was degeneration of the red blood cell-forming tissue and incompleteness of the white blood cell-forming tissue. This child's metabolism was reduced by 30%. All tendon reflexes were increased. The Babinski reflex of both great toes was also positive.</p>
<p>In short, the reason why this child became a dwarf and the various pathological conditions of her whole body are all symptoms of congenital thyroid deficiency. Therefore, her attending physician gave her 0.00003gm of thyroxin (Thyroxin) five drops daily, or half a tablet of Thyreoglancol daily, and sometimes combined with vitamin B1 (two tablets three times a day). This lasted for about a year. This child's body has improved greatly (see Figure 3). She can now sit up and play with toys. She also has feelings about the surrounding things. Her intelligence has also improved significantly. With the support of her hand, she can actually walk. The myxedema of her whole body has completely disappeared. Her face also has various expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. As for the bones, there is an even more significant improvement. As evidenced by X-rays, they are like the bones of a five-year-old child (see Figure 4). Her original height was 81 centimeters, and now it is 93 and a half centimeters. Her previous hemoglobin was 58%, and now it is 83%. Her previous red blood cells were 2.7 million, and now they have increased to 4.07 million. If this treatment can be continued in the future, there will definitely be greater improvements in her body. (This matter is seen in the Swiss University Medical Journal and the Helvetica Pediatric Medical Journal (Helvetica Paediatrcia Acta (Series D) 2, No. 2, 154-173 (1947). It has been reviewed by physicians Franceschetti, F. Bamatter, and D. Klein and reprinted by the Swiss Roche Medical Digest. The matter is indeed accurate and is absolutely not made up).</p>

<h3>Remembering Song Zheyuan: One of the "Low Eaves" Memories</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" Incident, when the four northeastern provinces fell, the Japanese atmosphere was pressing inward, and its arrogance was soaring. North China, especially Tianjin and Beijing, was already under strict walls, and the people were under "low eaves." The Japanese were causing trouble everywhere, and the successive authorities found it difficult to support themselves. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council of General Song Zheyuan, facing internal and external condemnations and dealing with all parties, truly had "sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy" experiences, which are hard to describe.</p>
<p>The Japanese wanted him to "clarify" (clarify to the extent of the puppet Hebei-East government of Yin Rugeng), and the Chinese also disliked his lack of clarity (clarify to the appearance of the former Hebei Political Council of Huang Fu). Old Song's idea was that he could not learn the "Hebei-East style" of clarity from the Japanese, and used "not too clear to the Central Government" to block the Japanese's mouths. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council, with the attitude of "clarifying itself," struggled, using methods of dodging left and right, enduring the time of one year and eight months. (The Hebei-Chahar Political Council was established on December 8, 1935, until the Lugouqiao Incident broke out on July 7, 1937.)</p>
<p>On January 7, 1936, "Hebei-Chahar" demanded that the puppet "Hebei-East" cancel "autonomy" and return more than 20 counties. The puppet "Hebei-East" replied that it "could not," and the Japanese garrison also warned against oppressing "Hebei-East." Military Attaché Isogai of the Japanese Embassy also declared that "Japan's clarification of its demands on North China means complete detachment from the rule of the National Government." This is the "clear talk" of "clarification." Isogai was the guy who suffered a defeat in Taierzhuang and later became the puppet governor of Hong Kong!</p>
<p>"Hebei-Chahar" suffered a lot from the puppet "Hebei-East," such as taking over land assets in the Tanggu area, intercepting ticket money from the Pingdong Railway, and all public tax revenues. The "Hebei-Chahar" territory was originally pitifully small (unlike the previous political councils that governed the provinces of Shandong and Shanxi). The "Hebei" was divided into "half the country" by old Yin's Hebei-East. The name was two provinces, but one province was not enough in reality.</p>
<p>There were also many frictions with Japan, such as the Chaoyangmen Incident, the Fengtai Incident, the Sheng Nong Yuan Incident, and the intrusion of Japanese police into the Tianjin Provincial Government Office. In several conflicts, "Hebei-Chahar" settled them through negotiation. Although they made concessions, they expressed their stubborn attitude of "clarifying themselves." The Japanese side's intention was that as long as you were not "clarified" to the Central Government, it could be treated as a local incident and settled as it was. The reason why it rubbed so many times without breaking down lies here.</p>
<p>Later, when Tianjin and Beijing held the National Assembly elections, the Japanese once clamored, believing that it was "centralization." However, their only concern was not here. They thought that "Hebei-Eastization" would be able to completely "clarify" the situation, and all friction would naturally disappear into Japanization.</p>
<p>Japan insisted on its so-called "clarification," forcing old Song to move from "clarifying himself" to "clarifying" in the direction that Japan opposed. When the "July 7th" Incident broke out, old Song finally expressed his intentions with facts. Did he truly "clarify" himself?</p>
<p>Half a year after "Hebei-Chahar" withdrew its troops, the puppet "Provisional Government" appeared. "Hebei-East" still wanted to retain its territory, but the Japanese did not allow it and ordered it to dissolve and merge. Thus, "puppet clarification" occurred in "Hebei-Chahar," and "puppet clarification" occurred in "Hebei-East."</p>
<p>For eight years, Japan surrendered, the puppet government collapsed, and the Chinese "truly clarified North China"!</p>
<h3>Sleeping Through a Lifetime</h3>
<p>— Luo Ta</p>
<p>It's rare to live to seventy years old. The first twenty years are too young, the last twenty years are too old, and the middle period is just right for sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, sleeping away a lifetime.</p>
<p>The Chinese are the most prone to sleep in the world. No, they should be said to be the easiest nation to fall asleep. You can find compatriots napping in any corner. Westerners invented spring beds, Simmons mattresses, down quilts, wool pillows, various pajamas, and even sleeping pills for sleeping. To the Chinese, who can snore loudly in minutes after sitting down, these are all superfluous and overly elaborate. Tram cars, theaters, parks, classrooms, offices... where can't one sleep? We can fall asleep peacefully in any environment and are too lazy to put on so many airs with Westerners just for sleeping. That's why I say the Chinese are the easiest to fall asleep, not the most adept.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, a German scholar came to China and stayed in a hotel where he couldn't sleep all night due to the noise. Later, he wrote an article saying: "...The shouting, yelling, quarreling, and many sounds I still can't figure out what they were, in the hotel I stayed in, almost made me believe that a revolution was about to break out. What's especially surprising is that everyone else was sleeping soundly. I think the structure of Chinese people's ears must be somewhat different." Although no anatomist has yet proven this, the Chinese people's astonishing environmental adaptability to sleep is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Of course, I am not praising insomnia here. Being able to fall asleep easily is indeed a blessing, but the Chinese transitioning from "easy sleep" to "chaotic sleep" is a great misfortune, which has stagnated our culture for hundreds or even thousands of years. In China, a clerk is always a clerk, a typist is always a typist... because they just go to sleep after getting off work. Two or three months ago, I read a passage in a foreign newspaper about a British thief's criticism of the contemporary literary scene in his country. He spoke eloquently and familiarly, showing that this robber did not just eat and doze off after each "burglary and murder" with a full load. He sometimes read books and wrote articles in his den.</p>
<p>The initial idea or motivation for great scientific inventions and literary creations in ancient and modern times often comes from a moment of inspiration. At that time, they didn't consider themselves scientists or writers. They just didn't sleep randomly in their spare time and were willing to sit down and think. If Watt had been sleeping next to the boiling kettle, how could he have "seen the lid open by itself, and wondered about the common meaning" and invented the steam engine?</p>
<p>Why talk about "it's rare to live to seventy years old"? According to statistics, the average lifespan of Chinese people is only forty! If you dig out the "middle section," there is little left before and after. Have we ever had a lively and dynamic youth and a quiet and contemplative old age? Haven't we long since merged into the "middle" to sleep?</p>
<h3>Why Not Open the School Gates Wide?</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>When the Legislative Yuan discussed the University Law and whether there should be equivalent academic qualifications for university admission, some people said: "According to reports from various sources, most of those causing student unrest are first-year university students. Therefore, the entrance exam must be strict, and those with equivalent academic qualifications should not be allowed to apply to universities." Others believed: "The door for those with equivalent academic qualifications to apply to universities must never be opened. Otherwise, those who rely on connections to enter will use this as a shortcut in the future." Both of these gentlemen's remarks made me "very dissatisfied."</p>
<p>The argument that "most of those causing student unrest are first-year university students, therefore the entrance exam must be strict, and those with equivalent academic qualifications should not be allowed to apply to universities" is about as logical as saying: "Most of those crying and making noise in a family are newborn babies. Therefore, we must strictly prevent our children from crying before they are born, and those with organs that have the same potential to cry should not be allowed to be born." Student unrest has no relationship with the strictness of the entrance exam. Because the strictest exam can only come up with difficult questions that even the principal and professors would have difficulty passing, it can never guarantee that students will not cause unrest. Suppose we set an exam question like: "Could Zilu's courage be enough to be a Japanese suicide bomber?" or "Was Bo Niu's disease dengue fever or malaria, and what was the temperature, pulse, and breathing rate when he was dying?" If the examinees could cite scriptures and answer fluently, who would dare to guarantee that this student would not cause student unrest? As for student unrest and equivalent academic qualifications for university entrance exams, they are even more irrelevant, because what they have is academic ability, not the ability to cause student unrest.</p>
<p>The argument that "the door for those with equivalent academic qualifications to apply to universities must never be opened. Otherwise, those who rely on connections to enter will use this as a shortcut" assumes that the goal is to cultivate talents for the country. Is there any reason why the fewer talents, the better? Young people with equivalent academic qualifications who apply to universities rely on "academic ability," not "connections." Why can't this door be opened? Moreover, in reality, not only do students who graduate from middle school and apply to universities based on their academic qualifications often rely on connections because there are too many students and not enough places, but even students who want to enter lower-cost elementary schools also have to rely on connections from their parents because Chinese people only know how to control the number of nuclear weapons and not how to control fertility. It should be known that even if young people rely on connections to seek education, the authorities should always consider their eagerness to learn, and as long as they have the academic ability to pass the exam, they should open the school gates wide. Why hang up a tiger-headed sign saying "Youths, do not enter this important school property!"?</p>
<p>The door that should be closed tightly is the yamen (government office), because those who enter officialdom often do not have certain abilities and rely solely on connections. It's a pity that the bricklayers and carpenters who build the yamen have always been negligent in their work, always leaving a big crack in the door for people to squeeze through!</p>
<h3>Relative</h3>
<p>— Ding Zhong</p>
<p>In Shanghai, on the nights of the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, there is always the sound of people selling long ingots (incense). Now, I hear a string of "Want long ingots" outside the window. I really don't understand why old habits are so difficult to change? And the so-called "abolished" lunar calendar never seems to have any hope of being "abolished," probably because it is related to this kind of "serving the dead" thing.</p>
<p>Originally, most things in the world are relative. There must be disadvantages to advantages, and there must be advantages to disadvantages. Taking the two words "life and death," their weight and gain seem to be quite difficult to say. Confucius can be said to be the most practical. He did not advocate mysterious talk, so "the Master did not speak of strange phenomena, feats of strength, disorders, and spiritual beings." He also said, "If you do not yet know about life, how can you know about death?" This practical attitude of paying attention to "living people" and not flattering "dead people" has dominated Chinese politics and society for thousands of years without the slightest change, and has become Confucianism. But people cannot but have ideals in their thoughts, because reality is sometimes unsatisfying; thus, the thoughts of Buddhism infiltrated, and with the later input of Western culture, some people shouted to overthrow the Confucian shop. Buddhism initially seemed to be about self-cultivation and self-certification, but later, someone started offering chanting scriptures and repentance ceremonies to help people transcend death; this reversed the Confucian style, and the so-called pursuit of ideals became a situation where they didn't care about "living people" and only cared about "dead people." Thus, it was again criticized by society as superstition. Placing too much emphasis on "life" has its shortcomings, and focusing solely on "death" also has obvious drawbacks. How to balance "life and death" is worth considering.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in the newspaper that refugees in Shanghai occupied various coffin depositories. After moving the coffins out, they moved in. It is said that there are five or six coffin depositories occupied in the Yangshupu area. This is indeed a difficult question. Taking care of "life" means not being able to take care of "death," and taking care of "death" means not being able to take care of "life." It is really difficult to satisfy both. Are "dead people" more important or "living people" more important? If there were no coffin depositories to plan for "dead people," the refugees would have no place to occupy; originally, it was for "dead people," but now it has become a way to provide for "living people."</p>
<p>There are countless examples of this kind of relativity. Don't we often see the phrase "imprisonment in taxation"? Then what is the difference between "imprisonment" and "taxation"? Humans are rational animals, and humans are also emotional animals. Both statements are correct. The more I think about it, the less I understand, and the sound of "Want long ingots" comes again.</p>
<h3>Class Reunion Yearbook</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>At the end of the year and in the cold weather, I suddenly received a class reunion yearbook from Hong Kong. Having been away from school for eight years, with frequent turmoil and separation, news of classmates has long been cut off. I am grateful to the classmate in Hong Kong who actually investigated in great detail. Under the dim light of the cold night, I faced this booklet and couldn't help but feel a thousand emotions!</p>
<p>Our country emphasizes "togetherness," so there are names like "fellow villager," "same year," "same school," and "colleague." This "classmate" combines the meanings of "same year" and "same school" from the past. Eight years of turmoil and still as down-and-out as before, I can't help but feel a lot of "many classmates were young and not humble, riding fat horses in Wu Ling." There are quite a few in the booklet who boast high titles such as "Doctor" and "Professor," but what I care about is that nine out of ten of these "Doctors" and "Professors" are abroad, and the one who came back is in a similar situation to me!</p>
<p>What is even more lamentable is that after eight years of hardship, unexpectedly, so many classmates have died? Apart from one who was bombed to death in an air raid in Guiyang, almost all the others died of lung disease. Even the strong and tall ones who were good at baseball and basketball in school also died of lung disease. Being an impoverished civil servant, with insufficient nutrition and an unstable life, is often the main cause of disease. Looking back on the past, it is truly tearful. Could it be that my classmates were particularly weak and let the country down?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the number of classmates who have come to this prosperous city has gradually increased, which I wouldn't have known without the yearbook. The world is full of changes. Those who died have died, those who are overseas are overseas, and what contributions have this group of us who stayed behind made? I am ashamed to say that I seem to be experiencing some middle-age feelings.</p>
<h3>Zhang Pu's Last Work: Poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge"</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Hanshan Temple in Suzhou is famous for the poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge" by the Tang Dynasty poet Zhang Ji ("The moon sets, crows caw, frost fills the sky; River maples and fishing lights face my sorrowful sleep. Outside Gusu city is Hanshan Temple; Midnight bells reach the traveler's boat.") Wen Zhengming of the Ming Dynasty once recorded Zhang's original poem on a stone in Hanshan Temple to highlight the scenic spot. Later, due to years of peeling and erosion, Cheng Xuelou repaired Hanshan Temple at the end of the Qing Guangxu period and commissioned Qu Yuan to rewrite the poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge" and erected a monument as a memorial. After the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders not only seized the bell of Hanshan Temple (an antique from before the Tang Dynasty), but also moved the stone tablet written by Qu Yuan elsewhere. After the victory, the people of Wu planned to re-engrave the poem to enhance the old system, or planned to ask Shen Yinmo of Wuxing to write it. Only Wu Hufan advocated that Zhang Puquan, a veteran of the Republic of China, write it, because the name of Pu Lao happened to be the same as the original poet Zhang Ji. Therefore, through the introduction of Liu Yusheng and Pu Yicheng, Pu Lao was asked to write it. However, there was no news for a long time, and bad news came that Pu Lao had suffered a stroke and passed away. Hufan was very disappointed, thinking that Hanshan Temple had no chance. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, he suddenly received a letter from Pu Yicheng, and when he saw it, it was indeed Pu Lao's last work, the poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge." The brushwork is elegant and vigorous, and the postscript says: "I have long admired the scenic spot of Hanshan Temple. I have traveled to Wu many times, but I have never visited it. Mr. Hufan in Shanghai said that my name is the same as the person who wrote the poem 'Night Mooring by Maple Bridge' in the Tang Dynasty, and asked me to write this poem to be engraved on stone. However, my name takes the meaning of a long-lasting value, not rashly imitating the poet. Zhang Ji of Cangzhou in December of the 36th year of the Republic of China." Among the veterans of the Party and the country, Yu Youren, Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, and Zhang Jingjiang are all famous for their calligraphy in the world, and Pu Lao's cursive script is unique among them. The National History Museum believes that since this poem "Night Mooring by Maple Bridge" is Pu Lao's last work, it wants to keep the original work in the museum for memorial after it is engraved on stone. It is said that Hufan has replied to Pu expressing his consent, which is not only a national document, but also a good story in the art world.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Unexpected Calamity (25)</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, that Doctor Wei came out wearing a snow-white coat. Zhu Zhai shook hands with him, and pointed to Qi Huan saying, "This is my relative, Miss Li. She had a car accident on the way here, and she is a little injured. Please check her." Doctor Wei led Qi Huan into the house. Two nurses helped to examine her. It was just skin damage on her face and arms, and it wasn't a big deal. Immediately, they washed, disinfected the blood stains on her face and hands, and then applied ointment and wrapped it with bandages. Zhu Zhai asked for a sick room and helped Qi Huan to rest in the bed inside. At this time, Qi Huan's mind was slightly settled, and the pain was slightly lessened. Thinking about it, she felt sad again, and tears kept falling. Zhu Zhai diligently comforted her, "Why do you have to be so pessimistic! The matter has already passed, don't think about it anymore." Qi Huan sobbed, "If I hadn't seen you, I would have drowned myself. I really have no face to live, it's better to die clean!" Zhu Zhai said, "Don't think like that. Tonight, besides you and me, no third person knows. I can swear that no matter what the content of this matter is, I will never ask or mention it, and I will never reveal a single word to others. Do you believe me?" Seeing that he said it so sincerely, Qi Huan was very moved, and couldn't help but hold Zhu Zhai's hand tightly and say, "Before, I only respected you, but now I not only appreciate you, but also..." Saying this, she choked again, and tears continued to flow from her eyes. Zhu Zhai quickly took out the handkerchief that Qi Huan had given him in the park from his suit pocket and gently pressed it on Qi Huan's face. Qi Huan continued, "My temper is very stubborn. I didn't expect to fall into someone else's hands today!" Zhu Zhai said, "You don't have to think about this anymore!" Qi Huan said, "How can I not think about it! I will never forget the shame of today, and I will definitely avenge this! I hate that man named Lin, and I will settle the score with him one day." Zhu Zhai said, "Why do you have to be so knowledgeable with this kind of person! With your identity and future, it's not worth it to associate with this kind of person. Let's not talk about this!" Qi Huan said, "If I don't say it, you won't understand. I'm not a confused person. I wanted to add some stage costumes because I'm staging two historical plays, and this man named Lin promised to provide me with costumes, so I was just perfunctory with him. I originally wanted to take advantage of him, but I didn't expect to suffer a big loss." Seeing that what she said was exactly the same as what Little Wang's mother had told him, it showed that she was struggling for art, and she had no choice but to take this risky and opportunistic behavior due to environmental pressures. He felt both pity and respect in his heart, and squeezed the hand that Qi Huan was holding tightly. He said, "I understand your hard work, and I respect you very much. You are very pure, and you are worthy of admiration for your hard work for the sake of your artistic future. Everything is the sin of society, and it has nothing to do with you. It is the evil society that caused your misfortune, and you fell into this trap. You are so pitiful!"</p>
<h3>Dongpo Pork</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>The Tianxiang Restaurant, a Hunan cuisine restaurant on Guangxi North Road in this city, is famous for its braised "Dongpo Pork." According to the origin of the name "Dongpo Pork," it has been around for a long time. Liang Zhangju's "Continued Talks on Wandering Footprints" also has a record of "Dongpo Pork": Today's food has the name "Dongpo Pork," which means braised pork. Any chef can make it. Some say that we should not insult Dongpo like this. I say that this slope (Dongpo) took it upon himself. Dongpo Gong (Su Shi) has a poem about eating pork, saying, "The pork in Huangzhou is good, and the price is as cheap as dirt. The rich are unwilling to eat it, and the poor don't know how to cook it. Cook it slowly over a low fire with little water, and it will taste delicious when the heat is sufficient. Get up every day and have a bowl, and be satisfied. Don't let anyone else care." When Dongpo was demoted to Huangzhou, he was very poor, but because the price was cheap, he could still eat meat every day. Today, even the cheapest belly pork costs more than 30,000 yuan per catty. If Dongpo were alive today, even if he liked to eat meat, he wouldn't even think about "getting up every day and having a bowl!"</p>
<p>Illustrated Chongqing Storytelling</p>
<h3>The Face of the Sacred Site Map</h3>
<p>— Bai Wuwen, Painting by Long Sheng</p>
<p>If it is said that Chongqing in the past few years was a representative work of a sacred site—a sacred anti-war map woven with the sweat and blood of the people of the whole country, it can be said today that this representative work has not only faded, but has also become tattered.</p>
<p>After the restoration, some schools were left here. During the most difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War, although the students ate rice full of impurities, barnyard grass, bran, and sand, they were full, and the calories could still maintain their minimum physical strength; although they used "bright oil lamps" for self-study, the minimum light was still enough to see the mimeographed handouts on Jiale paper; and the tattered cotton-padded jackets and quilts could still cover the strong wind of the mountain city. Today, the students eat red porridge soup, and the monthly lighting fee is only enough for one and a half to two nights, so they have no choice but not to turn on the lights. As for clothes, only 30% of the students in a normal school wear cotton-padded clothes, and 40% huddle in their classmates' quilts and sleep. However, if A is covered, then B cannot be covered, and every night they pull back and forth, like dancing Qing lions during the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>Many factories were also left after the restoration. Their national industrialists run emergency alarms every day, borrowing money to buy rice for the workers. If not, they implement "robbing the factory,"—searching their own factory for tools or things that can be exchanged for money, and selling them to second-hand stalls. As for the shops that were left behind, let's take an example: you always remember the "369" soup noodle shops that were almost everywhere on the streets back then, right? Most of them have been changed to furniture stores and porcelain shops, selling furniture and bowls and plates piece by piece.</p>
<p>Not to mention the newspapers that were left behind. Some haven't paid their employees for three months, and the white-collar workers waste lead type day after day while starving.</p>
<p>This sacred site map has been smeared with many ink stains. In short, the face is completely different!</p>
