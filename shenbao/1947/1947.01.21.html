<h3>深盼中共相忍為國　捐除成見繼續協商　政府公布恢復和談方案</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿電〕中央宣傳都於一月廿日下午發表政府對於和平商談之願望及其經過之說明如下：國民政府以實行憲政完成建國為最大目標，故於國家之和平統一，殆無時無刻不在蘄求之中。遠在抗戰初期，為團結全國力量起見，乃羅致各黨派人士及社會賢達，成立國民參政會。至對中共問題，政府始終認為是一政治問題，故國民黨卅一年十一月十日中全會及卅二年九月十一中全會，皆一致王張用政治方法速謀解決，卅三年五月以後，政府與中共代表間之不斷商談，即在企求獲得政治解決之方案。三十四年三月一日憲政實施協進會開會時，蔣主席曾再三說明，中共問題必須從速和平解決，幷提出憲政實施三步驟，良以中共問題，懸而不決，實為國家統一及一切建設之重大障礙。迨抗戰勝利以後，蔣主席電邀中共領袖毛澤東先生來渝商談，卒於同年十月十日雙方簽定雙十會談紀要，並表示乃將在互信互讓之基礎上繼續商，以求得圓滿之結果。自去年初，政治協商會議開會以來，政府與共產黨關於軍事與交通等各種問題商談諸階段中，更承盟邦美國馬歇爾將軍多方努力，促成各種協議，中外一致企待，共</p>
<p>政冶協商會議原為　十會談紀要中重要決定，於三十五年一月十日召開于陪都之重慶，所有各項協議，政府歷次宣示與國民黨二中全會決議，「都願以最大的誠意興各黨派及社會人士精誠相與協力一致，以促其實行」，然一年以來，政協決議多未能見諸實行者，實由下列事實有以致之：</p>
<p>（一）東北九省政權，依照中蘇協定，原應由國民政府接收，當蘇軍開始撤退，政府派軍進駐東北之時，中共軍隊多方阻撓，且於三月中旬佔領政府所接收之遼北各地，並進攻四平街，長春，哈爾濱，齊齊哈爾等地，政府為履行條約義務，維持接收主權計，不得有三月廿七日東北調處之協議，然後疊經調處，仍無結果。東北問題至今猶不能順利解決，面政治協商會議所決議之五月五日召開之國民大會，亦且因之延期。</p>
<p>（二）上年五月政府還都南京以後，以東北衝突有加無已，華北交通破壞如故，特自六月七日起，與中共雙方下令停戰十五天，對於完全停止東北衝突，恢復國內交通，實施整軍方案三事，幾已得到協議，不意停戰命令雖經三次展限，而中共又在停戰期內，侵佔德州泰安等地，幷圍攻大同及濟南與靑島外圍，以此雙方所擬定之協議，仍未能為有效之解決。</p>
<p>（三）十一目國民大會召開以前，政府鑒干國內局勢之擾攘不安，以及全國人民渴望和平之迫切，更感於各黨派無黨派人士所表示期望，及早停止衝突之　誠，復於十月十六日向共產產黨提出八項諒解，以便下令停戰，如期召開國民大會，制定憲法，雖經第三方面人士奔走幹旋，提出折衷方案，政府一再表示願意讓步，不意又為共產黨堅定反對該折衷方案，幷要求停開國大而停頓。</p>
<h3>依照三人會決議　軍事位置自無爭執必要</h3>
<p>通過憲草亦係遵照政協原則</p>
<p>國民大會以後，政府以憲政實施有期，亟欲恢復和談，幷經美國司徒大使轉達中共，吿以政府願意派員赴延安，繼續進行商談，而乃共產黨之答覆，仍以恢復去年一月十三日以前軍事位置及取消國民大會所制定之憲法為先決條件，殊不知去年一月十三日以前軍事位置，因越時經年，彼此位置變更甚大，而且政府已經收復之地區，如一經撤退，則該區人民之生命財產，即無所依託，恢復秩序保護人民，乃為政府之職責所在，何忍使人民再遭報復仇殺之慘禍。如共產黨果有和平之誠意，儘可依照三人會議所已成立之整軍與統編各方案實施，則一時之軍事位置，自無爭執之必要。至於取消憲法，則此决制憲國民大會，乃由全國各民族各省市各職業代表所組成，而且政協決議早已規定，其間各黨派及社會賢達亦皆共同參加，決非如中共所稱，係為國民黨一黨包辦者，况其所通過之憲法，亦即共產黨與各黨派共同參加之政協所協議之原則及憲草審議會根據該項原則所制成之憲法草案，中共實無理由可以反對。</p>
<p>新方案內容</p>
<p>根據以上各種事實，可知政府為國家和平與統一計，己不惜委曲求全，以冀中共之反省，良以「軍隊國家化」「政治民主化」為政治協商會議共同信守之目標，中共果能眞誠實踐，似不應固執成見，有所疑慮。總之，抗戰勝利已逾一年，和平統一不容再綏，深盼中共體諒政府相忍為國，力求政治解決之苦心，捐除成見，繼續協商。政府仍願以最大之忍讓竭誠相與，虛懷接納，特再揭　恢復和平方案，以為繼續和談與改組政府之依據。方案如左：</p>
<p>（一）政府願意派員赴延安或請中共派員來京，繼續進行商談，或舉行圓桌會議，邀請各黨派及社會賢達參加。</p>
<p>（三）政府與中共雙方立即下令，就現地停戰，並協議關於停戰之有效辦法。</p>
<p>（三）整編軍隊及恢復交通，政府仍願根據三人會議過去協義之原則，繼續商談軍隊駐地整編程序，以及恢復交通之實施辦法。</p>
<p>（四）在憲法實施以前，對於有爭執區域之地方政權，政府願意與共產黨商定公平合理之解決辦法。（完）</p>
<h3>我國接收大連　法律上無問題</h3>
<p>熊式輝在京研究中</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電〕政威方面息，關於接收大連，法律上毫無問題，其困難在共軍己在大通市內出現活動，如何司使國軍順利接收，不致引起財富及生靈之毀損。熊式輝來京後，中蘇雙方正就接收技術審愼研究，惟其結果如何，或將隨國內政治局勢轉移。</p>

<h3>司使等待機會　重新試探和平</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿日電〕華方可靠人士稱：美大使司徒雷登，現正探詢政府與中共常局意見，俾確定相當機會，重新試探和平，果爾，政府須先在政治方面作更大讓步，惟美大使館未能證實此說。司徒大使迭次晋謁蔣主席，並晤國民黨政協會議代表後，昨日延見民社黨張君勳，又邀民盟新任秘書長張東蓀同進午餐，以便斷定小黨派對重新試探和平之態度。</p>

<h3>溥儀弟媳返日</h3>

<h3>民盟對於時局　提出四項建議</h3>
<p>主張重新協商成立聯合政府</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟於二十日下午二時半假淸華同學會舉行記者招待會，張　，鮮英，羅隆基，章伯鈞等均出調節，由羅隆基提出民盟之時局宣言，並就各要點加以說明。</p>
<p>宣言共分六點</p>
<p>宣言全長一萬六千餘言，共分六個部份：第一部份，說明民盟之本質，目的及工作方法。謂：民盟為一「獨立自主的政團」，「目的在實現中國的民主」，其首要工作在「調解國共黨爭，以求得國家的團結，統一與和平」。第二部份，檢討去年之和談，認為下解決東北問題，為政協失敗之源，當時如此損置，民盟即加以反對。羅氏强調政協決議之精神在執行政　決議之程序上，故如無聯合政府產生，共同執行各項決議，而由一黨政府實施時，政協精神已被破壞。第三部份，為國內問題之分析，偏重經濟方面，對於人民之痛苦，尤為討論之主題。第四部份，研究國際形勢，指明馬帥調解之失敗，應歸過於美國對華政策之錯誤，希望能加以修正。並特別指出對美國少數短見之士，欲扶助日本，以圖支配亞洲。第五部份，檢討去年之民主運動，特別注重民盟人物之損失。</p>
<p>和談三項條件</p>
<p>第六部份為結論，認為恢復和談，有三項先決條件，即：（一）政府應首先切實保陣人民之自由。（二）政府應首先終止一切長期戰爭之進備。中共方面亦應停止全面動員，以安定社會人心，亦所以表示中共願意和談之誠意。（三）政府應切實承認，並尊重黨派平等合法之地位。在先決條件做到後，民盟對於時局，有四項建議：（一）努力促成和談，反對「改組政府之後再謀恢復和談」之辦法。因其將造成「長期內戰與永久分裂」。（二）重新舉行政治協商，而此次之協商之必具條件為：權力上必須高於參加之黨派，討論範國內，必須及於全國政治。軍事，經濟等全盤問題。去年政協將政治與軍事切分解決，討論中央政治機構而不及地方機構，今日視之，均屬失策。（三）實行以往之政協決議，因去年之政協決議，不啻中國之大憲章，各黨派共同簽訂之契約，必須共信共守。（四）成立聯合政府，此項聯合政府為「舉國一致各黨各派殾有平等參加」之聯合政府，包括地方政府在內。</p>
<h3>拉古哨水豐大堤　已由我派軍接防　水豐電廠產權在談判中</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿日電〕安東警備司令部陳參謀，十八日八時率士兵分乘汽車八輛赴拉古哨，十九日下午到達，二十日午按雙方的定接替蘇軍防務，蘇軍撤回北鮮，因而水豐大堤，已由我負責保護，對岸即為水豐電廠所在地。該廠產權問題尙在談判中。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿日電〕此間報紙在蘇軍撤防拉古哨後著論稱，當中共破壤擾亂之際，盟邦蘇軍的守護功績是値得稱這的。</p>
<p>〔本報濟陽廿日電〕安東附近暢綠江中小島花草坪主權交涉，我方關係當局，正準備材料中。又輯安北橋頭蘇軍撤退事，尙待洽商。</p>
<h3>第六屆三中全會　已決定於三月十五日舉行　中常會第五十二次會決議</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕關於定期結束檢舉漢奸產業一案，中央信託局蘇浙皖區敵偽產業淸理處已奉令，對人民或團體，於抗戰期間，漢奸案件之吿發，以卅五年十二月卅一日以前為限，逾期之吿發，檢察官不予置議，但國家之追訴權及被害人之吿訴權，不因此而受影響。</p>
<h3>西沙羣島問題　可望和平解決</h3>
<p>白部長在紀念週報告</p>

<h3>社論　從西沙羣島到法國的殖民政策</h3>
<p>據報載稱，法國方面已派軍艦若干艘，載有陸戰隊，凖備駛往西沙羣島登陸，我國駐防該羣島之海軍已向國防部請示。這一個消息雖未經官方證實，但以常識判斷，其可靠性却相當的大。緣法國外交部發言人最近會於九日宣稱，法國素認兩沙羣易係屬於越南，但在未獲正式報吿足以證實中國軍隊業已佔領西沙羣島之前，法國政府尙未決定究將採取何種行動。這一段的談話，係山路透社傳至中國，在報端發表之後，輿情譁然，各報記者紛紛電詢外交部，乃由歐洲司長葉公超予以答覆稱：「中國政府已由日本佔領中收回西沙羣島，該羣島主權本屬中國，故無須經過向任何方面請求收回之手續。』由此可知西沙羣島父成爲中法兩國爭奪的對像了。</p>
<p>法國方面認爲西沙羣島的主權應屬於越南，她所依據的理由有四：（一）安南國王在十八世紀及十九世紀時，曾迭次要求取得西沙羣島之主權，迨至一九二〇年始由中國加以佔領，並將其行政權劃入海南島，至一九三〇年中國政府決定開採西沙羣島之資源，但法國以安南五國之保護者自居，乃出而表示異議，並謂法國亦欲採取同樣行動。（二）法國在一九三七年向中國提出友善處理辦法，並表示若爲中國政府所拒絕，則請第三國出面仲裁。（三）中國在一九三八年曾同意法國以代表安南王國之名義，佔領西沙羣島，直至日軍於一九四五年三月佔領該羣島時，越軍始退出該羣島。（四）西沙羣島在軍略上頗爲重要，但在第二次大戰中，並未供作軍略上之使用。</p>
<p>法方所提供的理由，顯然不够充足，實在也沒有加以辯正的價値。我們依照法理與事實，實在不難證明西沙羣島應爲我國所有：第一，西沙羣島的主權屬於中國，由來已久，其行政權亦劃入廣東省內，中國的漁人每年必自海南島前往西沙羣島，從事捕魚，中國海軍亦不時前往巡弋。第二，一八五八年的中法天津條約附有地圖，可以證明西沙羣島屬於中國。第三，中國海關於一九〇八年，爲船隻航行安全計，曾提議在西沙羣島建立燈塔；一九三〇年國際氣象會議在香港舉行時，亦曾有人提議，由中國政府在西沙羣島設立氣象台，以利海上的航行。第四，中法兩國外交當局一九三二年至一九三八年之間，不知交換過多少件照會，中國政府在迭次致法國外交部的照會中，從未表示放棄其對於西沙羣島之主權；同時對於法國於一九三八年以安南王國之名義佔領西沙羣島，亦從未予以承認。第五，法國於一九三三年七月二十五日突然佔領我國團沙羣島時，中國駐法大使顧維鈞曾向法國政府提拙抗議，聲明該羣島不使在地理上爲形成中國領土之西沙羣島的一部份，而且島上所有住民亦以中國漁民佔多數，故主權屬於中國，法國應將此羣鳥歸還中國。這一個照會，實在是一個最有力的證據，法國外交當局可以把從前的檔案翻出來覆按。記得當時日本政府亦於是年八月廿一日發表聲明：「法國此次之佔領，在國際法上不能視為已生實效，日本對於法國之佔領團沙羣島，表示堅決反對。」</p>
<p>由上所述，可知西沙羣島之屬於中國，絕無疑義；而今法國竟強辭奪理，欲假越南的名義而企圖佔領西沙羣島，不論從那一個角度去觀察，都是法國的一種不智之舉，不僅將法國對於其海外殖民地仍懷有帝國主義的野心，暴露無遺；而且這樣企圖，必然要引起中國全國四萬五千萬人民的憤怒！中法兩國間的邦交，素極友好，尤其在第二次大戰中，中法兩國所處地位，頗多類似之處，故在兩國人民之間，時生「同病相憐」之感，使兩國友誼益趨鞏固，戰後中國人民對於法國政局，尤為關切；前天法國航空公司的第一架飛機，試飛抵滬，曾獲上海市民的熱烈歡迎，這就是中法人民友好的一個有力的證明。今後中法兩國自應設法促進兩國邦交，凡足以刺激兩國人民情感的舉動，都應該盡量避免，姑以目前的法越衝突而論，中國雖然同情越南人民的解放運動，但為珍惜中法兩國間的邦交計，仍保持中立的地位。這就是中國願與法國保持友好關係的表示。倫教泰晤士報前天評諭法國的殖民政策，謂其跡近羅馬帝國的政策，這一句逆耳忠告，是值得法國當局深思的。這種殖民政策在戰後和平民主的世界上，能否合乎時代的潮流，實有重加考慮的必要！</p>

<h3>從一個英國人的眼光中看盟國佔領下的日本（四）</h3>
<p>— 約翰·摩里斯原著　張德乾譯</p>
<p>（四）教育問題</p>
<p>我們現在再來談談整個佔領問題的中心問題。麥帥曾再三指令日本政府，務必在公私生活的每一方面都要採取民主方法。這一層，我已經把目前的成就叙說過了。所困難者，如麥帥自己所說的，是民主的本質。民主必須是漸漸地從人民本身的心願中產生出來的，若用純粹獨　的方法來施行民主，難免要失敗。然而只有先把日本民主化，才能解決整個遠東問題。</p>
<p>改變心理端賴教育</p>
<p>照我看來，這完全是一個長期敎育問題。我極端疑惑，有什麽方法可以改變日本成年人的心理。敎育的眞實目的在創造各種條件，使人民能够敎育他們自己。在日本我沒有看見過什麽東西足以使我相信，日本的成年人有一點改弦更張的意思，我恐怕最近遺返本國的八百萬散伍陸海軍人會鬧出事來。這班人曾受過日本軍閥長時期的精神敎育，他們的腦筋恐怕一時轉不過來。但是，直到我在一九四六年七月間離開日本時為止，他們的行為還是那麽好，幾乎可以稱為模範，這實在是想不到的。他們所以沒有鬧出什麼事來，或許是因為他們多數出身農家，而日本的農民，在目前的普遍糧荒中，所受到的影響還不算怎麼大。然而道並不是　他們沒有一點潛在的危險性。</p>
<p>澈底改造日人思想</p>
<p>我覺得，我們如果要完成日本的民主化，使他們的侵略慾將來不至於死灰復燃，我們所應當注意的不在任何短時期的「再敎育」，而在整個日本敎育系統的根本的改組。這顯然是一項極艱鉅的工作，却並不是不可能的。日本曾局也都承認日本敎育系統確有如此改組的必要，但是到現在為止還很少實際行動；那些已有成效的也祇限於純粹消極的工作。有幾種課目，例如歷史，地理，倫理等，在那種刪去一切褊狹的國家主義思想的新課本尙未出版以前，是不准教授的。有人建議，應當詳細審查每一個日本教員的證書，以便決定他們（或她們）是否適宜於這種職業。這似乎是非常對，而且非常正當的。還有人建議，應當召見每個日本敎員，舉行個別談話，這也是很對的。可是日本全國約有四十一萬四千名大中小學教員，我們必需一個極長的時期，才能够把這片敎育園地芟除淸楚，以便播種新的種籽。現在的敎員和學生都不能够凖時上課。這一部份是由於各處都鬧屋荒，而更重要的原因則是一般生活的不安定，和當局的缺少任何積極性的政策。不管怎樣，這些建議終祇能够解決這個問題的一半。至今還沒有人建議過，在那些不良教員（當然有許許多多教員是不良的）經過淘汰以後，如何去獲得新的敎員來代替他們。</p>
<p>長期佔領實有必要</p>
<p>我個人覺得除非是長期佔領，這個問題是不能够澈底解決的。佔領的時期至少當延長到包括整整兩代子弟的敎育，使他們將來在公眾服務時，不至於受到反動份子的影響。所以，佔領的時期必須延長到十五年至廿年。至於佔領軍的實際數額卻可以大大地減少。實在，在佔領將近結束的幾年中，只要一個員額很少而極度專門化的管制委員會使够了。</p>
<p>戰前，日本政府會聘用許多外國敎員在日本任敎，尤其是在高等學校和大學裏。他們多數是英美人，他們的影響之大是不能夠按他們的人數來衡量的。這種制度現在應當予以恢復和擴大。我們需要大量有資格的男女敎員到日本去任教，他們必須熟烈地信仰民主，準備以生平一部份的光陰，來宜傳民主的好處。</p>
<p>我這次到日本，覺得日本的年輕敎員和學生確都在要求我們給予輔助。他們中間頭交清楚的已經開始認識整個日本教育系統確有其謬誤之處。他們說不出究竟錯在什麼地方，但他們要在自身的教育尙未完成以前，先把這種錯誤糾正過來。如果我們現在不能修滿足他們這種要求，我們自己和我們的後代將來難免要吃虧的。（完）</p>

<h3>錢大櫆死無赦　聞判落魄喪魂　罪與周逆無分軒輊</h3>
<p>家屬掩面啜泣　表示將請覆判</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕僞中央儲備銀行副總裁錢大　，昨晨十時已由高院判處死刑。錢逆提庭時手執灰色羅宋帽，身穿深藍色綢面絲綿抱，繞羊毛圍巾，黃麂皮手套，紮脚褲，黑色紋皮鞋，由胡警長帶至庭上。劉庭長訊畢姓名年齡籍貫後，即起立宣讀判決書主文：「錢大櫆，通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處死刑，褫奪公權終身，全部財產，除酌留家屬必需生活費外，沒收」。當劉庭長朗聲宣讀主文至「處死刑」時，錢逆面色驟轉成灰白色，身體微顫。旋由劉庭長　嘵諭判決理由，略謂：「被吿錢大櫆受周逆佛海之慫恿，籌備組織偽中央儲備銀行，歷任該行「理事」及「副總裁」等職，均經自白供認不諱，其罪行最顯著者，爲擅定「二與一」之比例，强迫人民以法幣折換僞幣，並供敵僞幣二萬餘億元，及代敵收購大量物資，發行之僞幣總額達四十六億餘萬元，擾亂金融，違背國策，破壞抗戰，罪行重大，與周逆佛海相較，實無分軒輊，故處以極刑，如不服所判，可於接到判決書後十天以內，向最高法院聲請覆判。」錢逆聞言，仍注目呆視庭上，一言不發，嘴唇上下抖動。旁聽之被吿家屬婦女二人，則掩面抽泣。庭諭還押時，家屬追隨於後，錢逆亦頻頻回顧，以急促之步伐押回忠監。據錢逆家屬表示，接判決書後，即擬聲請覆判。按經上海高院判處死刑之漢奸，錢逆爲第十名。（其中梁鴻志已執行，祭培經最高法院改判無期徒刑。）</p>

<h3>桂中樞發明　方位檢字法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市法界耆宿桂中樞氏積三年餘之研究，發明「方位檢字法」及「漢字拚音法」兩種，對文字音韻學極有貢獻。桂氏因鑒於一般用「部首法」檢字之中文字典中，對於某一文字應歸人何一部首，毫無科學原則，檢字時往往浪費時間，實需改善。因此根據象形原則將所有文字之部首，分爲「優先」，「獨位」，「隔別」，「接通」，「混合」等五種，凡一有優先部首時，檢字即用優先部首，無優先部首時，用獨位部首，無獨位部首時，用隔別部首，以下類推。如此則檢字時可以「登堂入室」而不致誤翻其他部首。又因字典採用國音字母僅表明平聲，一字之上聲，去聲，須由讀者自行領會，難保正確，因此擬用漢字拚音法根據國音字母用漢字標明平上去三聲之韻，毋再用拚音法讀音。如此則平上去三聲可以正確，且能便利外人或幼童學習。桂氏現已將其著作呈請內政部註册，普擬即行採用此種新法之字典云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市司法機關自奉大赦令後，即進行辦理開釋工作。連日來釋放未決犯，已吿一段落，昨日起開始釋放合乎赦鋼規定之已決犯。計上海監獄開釋已決簡易案件在徒刑十五年以下之罪犯共二百八十一名（內白俄一名）。思南路地院看守所開釋已經判決確定但尙未送監執行之罪犯共三十六名（內白俄沙夫親谷·比鐵斯基二名）。共計三百十七名。今日仍將繼續開釋，舊曆新年照常工作。另在押合乎赦免規定之女犯，據悉定自今日起開始釋放，因吸毒被判徒刑之過期影星夏佩人，亦將於今日大除夕日獲釋，歸家過年。</p>

<h3>會商簡化手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高地兩院刑庭長檢察官等昨日下午集會商討釋放人犯緊急處理辦法，決定簡化手續迅速辦理，並儘可能避免交保，以减少流弊。凡（一）案件判決已確定者，依照大赦令，將卷宗與人犯一併交地檢處，由首席檢察官核准後，立即開釋。（二）案件不確定判決者，其中又分（甲）案件已判決，今在上訴中者，（乙）案件尙在審理中者·前者有屬高院，有屬地院，在此情形之下，乃徵詢被吿意見，如放棄上訴，則依判決確定論·如不放棄上訴，則視情節輕重·輕者立即開釋，重者必須交保。</p>
<p>據與會者告記者稱：政府旣頒布大赦令，本市所押合乎赦免規定之罪犯，自當迅速予以釋放，但事實上數千人欲在此廢曆年前一二天內全部開譯，手續上實不可能。因在審核方面，頗為費時。且案件有牽涉被告眾多者，有涉及另案者，有附帶民訴者，有需免刑者，有需减刑者，故論斷時，較爲困難，因而或有延遲一二天者。希人犯家屬在外，勿受人欺騙，而致有請託等舉動。</p>

<h3>我的妻子海倫</h3>
<p>— 趙雪山</p>
<p>離婚的數目證明婚姻極難維繫愛情。許多的婚姻都祇像束縛一般勉强維持着。謝謝我的妻子，她却使我逃脫了這種可怕的厄運！</p>
<p>海倫是樂觀的。我和她結婚已有十年，但每天回家時從來不曾見到她的一張乖戾的悲哀的或者冷淡的臉。</p>
<p>假使我精神衰頹，她的溫暖會使我振作。假使她自己的生活有了什麽困難，她會勇敢歡樂地面臨它。我看見過她三次生產，兩炙動手術，，但她的舉動却使人覺得我是受苦者，而她則在拯救我。</p>
<p>海倫是忠心的。我是她的人，她對我的忠心比我對自己的更甚。她是我的「迷」，我的代理人。不管我有多少次錯誤或失敗，她對我的能力及信念始終堅強。</p>
<p>她知道我們的三個孩子是世界上最有希望的少年。她把他們的健康，技能或和愛的每一點精華都小心記錄下來。她對待他們很嚴厲，目的在發揚他們的優越感。他們因她的嚴厲益能自重。海倫很浪費，但不是對於金錢，而是對她自己。她的性格下容她做一件事而半途歇手。當她解決一次難題時她老是志高氣昂地說，「這件事非做對不可。」</p>
<p>海倫不吹毛求疵。她不用那種「你爲什麼不做那件事？」的問題來煩攪我。她從不試着操縱我的事業，支配我的娛樂，選擇我的朋友，或者命令我做一切其他的雜事。</p>
<p>她不窺探隱事也不問長問短。假使我沒有興緻的話，她便下强迫我說。她能够等候。我不必像別的丈夫般每天必須作一番在何時與何人因何故往何處去的報吿。海倫最善聽。但却最拙於詢問。她不拆看我的信，也下搜查我的衣箱。我甚至不必爲金錢担心。並非我財源充沛的緣故，是我們彼此不須小裘計較。我每星期交給她一些錢，自己也留下一部份。她付淸家用，多餘的錢便適當的支用。我則付保險費，捐稅和醫藥費等，此外或儲蓄或化掉都聽諸己便。</p>
<p>海倫並非十全十美。她有她的特癖，雖然有幾處也似乎令人厭惱，但我却不願改變它們，因爲它們正是她人格的本色。他有一個弱點是說話太總括；假使在九月裏下過三天雨，她却說「整月的大雨」。她不怕整理衣櫥，行箱及抽屜；事實上它們老是零亂不堪。</p>
<p>海倫是有趣的，因爲她對她本身感覺興趣。生命使她歡樂也使她憂愁，她與激動一起前進。在她體內似乎老有一種驚奇和朗笑的水在沸騰。即使她不說話的時候，你也能看見她的心靈在作自我批評。她聽別人講最平凡的故事時的能度就如人描述珍珠港被偷襲一樣。因爲對她周圍發生的事物感覺興趣，她就不能太對她自己感覺興趣。許多女性有一種强烈的自覺，老在人前理髮整衣照鏡子，搽胭脂等，她却絕沒有這種不安的苦處。生活，嬉笑，痛苦，視覺，記憶，發現，創造，愛情——凡此種種戲劇都使她感動。對於她，婚姻不是厭煩；要做得好必須下番功夫，「但這件　是非做對下可」！</p>
<p>雖然在婚姻上面下苦功，她並不像別的女人般夢想把她的伴侶和子女全部攫爲己有。我不是她的囚犯，她也不是我的看守者。</p>
<p>那末結局是什麼呢？</p>
<p>這結局是奇怪而又甜蜜的；海倫不束縛我的自由，或者改變我的個性，她却確實爲她自己獲得了我的奴隸般的忠誠。</p>

<h3>男子的虛榮</h3>
<p>— 薇善</p>
<p>男子們常喜歡談女子的虛榮心，以反襯他們的高明。</p>
<p>我承認女子是愛虛榮的，但至少是公開的，例如我喜歡看報紙上關於美容的文字，幷不掩掩藏藏，而男子舞則不同了。</p>
<p>假使你要看到男子的虛榮心，最好在他穿好禮服預備去赴宴會的時候，你躱在他看不見的地方。他會慢慢的走到鏡子面前，他的手不由的在滿搽着油膏的亮髮上，輕輕的摸幾下，然後把領結拉拉直，假裝的彈去外套的灰塵，肩膀一挺，最後得意洋洋的走出去。</p>
<p>我們常聽說女子的裝飾是去吸引男性的，這並不正確，男子的裝飾是爲了吸引女性倒是眞的。女子愛美完全出自常性，她們裝飾，不管往來的人是男是女，都是一樣的。</p>
<p>假使有一女子被流到荒島上去，她們的手提箱內仍將有各種化裝用具及化裝品，你以爲她因爲沒有男子在島上，就終日的蓬頭垢面嗎？但純男性的團體生活，則大半是囚首垢面的。</p>
<p>多數的男子喜歡他的妻子穿惹人注目的衣服，許多男子鼓勵他的妻子，去做華貴入時的服裝</p>
<p>我曾經聽見一個男友說：「我愛我的妻子穿入時的服裝，如果她穿得很褸襤，那將降低了我的身價。」</p>
<p>這一句話，大概可以代表男子的虛榮心理了。</p>
<h3>漫談醬油</h3>
<p>— 順鼎</p>
<p>開門七件事，柴米油鹽醬醋茶，醬油也是七件事中的一大項，而醬油不但是調味品且因由黃豆及麥粉經長時間之發酵加水及食鹽製成，所以醬油之中除水以外，並合有極豐富的蛋白質，蛋白質乃營養素中最高等者，是身體造血肥肌的要素，食物之含有多量蛋白質而且易消化吸收者，即爲滋養食物，醬油含之蛋白質不但多，且已易於消化，醬油之有鮮味，完全是從蛋白質而來，滋味愈鮮，則蛋白質愈多，此外醬油還含有維他命B和D，鈣，燐等質，人體不可或缺乏的重要養料。近據專家的研究結果，知道醬油在治療上尙有幾種重要的性質，凡唱歌者若偶然喉啞，可吃一杯醬油湯，如能每晨食一杯熱醬油湯則時日一久聲音方面就會瞭亮而且淸脆。又到冰天雪地中去旅行或露宿，如果預先將醬油溫熱飲一杯，則非但可以抵禦寒氣，增加體溫，且可加强心臟的鼓動能力，或妊婦胎氣上衝及嘔吐，飲醬油也可以治療此外醬油亦能解鴉片毒砒毒，但是現在因爲製醬油的原料昂貴，所以一般無商業道德之商人，迭僞貨以博厚利，據去年報載，說本市有幾家醬油公司的醬油，被衛生當局查出完全是將水加食鹽及着色劑製成，我們如果買到了此種醬油，吃了能有益麽？所以我們買醬油還是到一爿規模大點且有點信譽的醬園去買，較爲妥當。</p>
<p>最後我將選擇醬油最普通而易行方法，寫於下面，藉供參考：第一上等醬油，如置舌尖嘗試，頓覺其味微甘帶鹹而純正，下等者則味酸且苦，而鹹味强，亦不純正。第二，取醬油滴於無色之玻璃瓶內，向日光中照之，帶紅顏色而發現極美觀之光澤；又入於白色之磁器內成紅褐色者則爲佳品；至於顏色帶黃褐或靑而黑色者且其光澤亦不純潔者則爲下品。第三，如以少量醬油置入於無色之玻璃瓶中，再把其瓶口塞沒而倒置，透照以日光，而視其底部之醬油痕跡，存在時間長則濃厚，如果時間短則爲稀薄品，第四盛少量醬油於白色磁器內，用筷子攪拌之則發生泡顏色爲淡黃者爲上品，至於泡現淡紅色或白色者爲下品。第五醬油之上等品如果煮沸後，而置入於白色之玻璃瓶中，則其中含有之蛋白質因以凝固，而現如霧如綫之狀，下等品則現雜質之混合物沉澱。第六純潔，而無雜質混合物之醬油，則其與水之比重，應爲一，一九一二〇至一，一九一二五</p>
<h3>新年，當心你的孩子！</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>國曆新年方過，舊曆新年又到，小孩子過新年的歡樂，比大人尤甚，想每個人都有這樣的過程吧！爲此在新年頭上，爲父母者，應格外當心小孩子。</p>
<p>當心小孩子的吃：新年　上，小孩子吃的東西格外多，一會兒點心，一會兒糖果。眞是一天到晚，嘴也沒有空；爲父母者，應知孩子食量有限，語云「病從口入」，多吃要滯胃，要肚脹。小孩子消化力量薄弱，若不當心他們的吃，過一個新年，反製造疾病。歡樂變爲憂慮，還是防患未然，吃有節制纔好。</p>
<p>當心小孩子化錢：新年頭上，孩子們例有壓歲錢進帳，但小孩子用錢不知方法，往往去購買無意義的玩具，如甩炮之類；甚至大些的孩子，也照樣玩賭博，切忌切忌，因從小習賭，印象頗深，長大了變本加厲，貽害無窮。孩子買玩具果餌，應得父母允許或指導爲妙。最好把孩子們進帳的壓歲錢，收儲起來，作爲正當用度，一半給孩子們買糖果玩弄或看電影，一半充作學金，或儲蓄，或救濟，那是化錢正當，無害而有益。</p>
<p>當心小孩子的玩：在新年頭上，孩子們當去入學，住在家中，有如失繮之馬，任意玩要，也是大不相宜，往往有孩子在新年頭上走失迷路，或在馬路上奔跑閘禍，爲父母者，宜隨時留意。</p>
<p>爲父母者，誰不寶愛孩子，趁此新年頭上，應格外當心你的孩子要緊！</p>

<h3>留影　億郁達夫</h3>
<p>— GM</p>
<p>近來和朋友們時常談及達夫先生。他那種唯心的藝術，是許多作家都學不會的。我們還不免受英雄主義的思想所籠罩，不崇拜平凡，認爲藝術這樣的東西，在世界的物質上，所用不及鍋爐與馬達，倘還不能以奇特方式或博大的精神取勝於人，或與人以安慰，或給人以優好的啓迪，那麽營營者必漸爲失去其本衷了。達夫有過道種英雄行爲；在單紙的藝術上，他自擬於喬琪穆亞（Goorge　moore），在態度上他不失爲做一們查多布里揚（Chateanbriand）他的作風劃定了中國文學上的一個派系。</p>
<p>我們最怕用道德的意識來看達夫，他原就是要站在這個觀念對方，才創作那種藝術的。他是五四運動產生出來的弄潮人。</p>
<p>達夫有很多愛載他的羣衆。這些人追逐他，都如志摩詩人所說，「達夫很可愛」沒有別的理由。他那唯心的抒情的寫作，憂鬱似的性情，泛泛不拘什麼的態度，確實容易克服那些心爲城府自我意識較强的人。</p>
<p>民國十四年，在北京初次到十剎海他的寓所去訪問他，心中浮着一個幻念，以爲那一定是雨果，雪萊那樣面容與風度的人，很有些踟躕不敢前進的樣子，及待見到他，覺得他很像管家的老闆，若不是穿那件半舊咖啡色的袍子的話。據說他在北京大學主講的是經濟學，但不久就因別有所就南下了。我們在上海時常聽到他的消息，行踪，在他到廣州去以前。</p>
<p>從廣州回來，他寫了許多文字。鷄肋集，日記九種，都是那一兩年間印行的。他的全集也漸次在各書坊間出現，「洛陽爲之紙貴」，這確實不是過份的描寫。從日記九種上，我們知道他的新家庭組織。我們都高興看他這一部書，認爲他有詩人的態度。他在這一兩年間，收羅了許多舊版西　，「無所不包」。他說，那是用車子拖回家的。他不預備往富陽山裏跑，也使我們感覺他的光明。</p>
<p>二十三年，他悄悄地住在杭州，小小幸福的家庭，孩子已是兩三個了。他不輕易出外去買醉了，磊磊落落，下時在西湖的蘇堤，可以發現他負着手，慢慢行着，侃侃的談着，後面隨從幾個穿洋服或將洋服揹在肩頭上的靑年。</p>
<p>好幾回，和敬文去扣訪他。「什麽也不寫了，」他不待人問，這樣說，「我收了許多書，將來預備，善價而估」。我們走進他的　房，眞有些感嘆連左思也不如了。他用廉價收得的版本，有些確實還珍貴。如DeCameron（Boccaccio）的英譯本，初版期—那時候撤米爾約翰蓀博士還沒有死。</p>
<p>他在之江敎了幾點鐘文藝批評，適逢他的藏書偏偏缺少這一方面的材料，特地到上海跑了兩次，廣搜窮索，僅僅找到一本Saint　Beuve的，法文本，一本美國琉依蓀Lewison編的，很通行，已給傅××先生譯了出來。向朋友備了一本文却斯特（Winchester）的批評原理，可是它太常見了，許多人說看過；丹麥布蘭克斯（G.Brandes）的弄不出頭緒；英國聖茨巴莉（Saints-berry）的太多，俄國別林斯基（Belinski）的根本買不到。他說：「都買過來了，也是倒霉生意。」</p>
<p>達夫事奉他的令堂很孝，常時回富陽去省視。他的令堂很衰邁，樸儉得幾乎太過份，而且十年八載，很少一次來看一看西湖。廿三年初夏，達夫接她到寓所來，遊了一天西湖，她似乎毫不感覺什麽，匆匆地就回去了。</p>
<p>二十三年夏，有人說是出生以來第一次的酷熱。達夫深居簡出，找們有時去探望他。時常逢着他一面在逗小孩，一面在寫文。有時候，他聽見外面有扣門聲，便先着人從信箱罅窺探。也許是倦客，也許是怕人恫嚇。那幾個年內，他簡直有點害怕什麽。西湖開了裂縫，有景緻也不易欣賞了。</p>
<p>此後便沒有見到達夫。二十八年，上海友人柯靈先生主編大美報副版，曾與着邀約，來信附言說：達夫到了新加坡沒幾月，便接得他自新加坡寄來是洲文藝，裏面也有創作小×子從軍，開始感覺達夫還很愛自己的人，自己的鄕土，他跑得那麽遠，是爲避囂，爲小兒女謀麵包，不是虛怯。那時候，還有人不時傳達他的消息，直到星洲不守之後。</p>

<p>這潔白而霏微比曇花一現還短暫的結晶物，每個人都愛好着它的，從童心的烙印起，以及哀樂中年的流浪，雖則至老年，也會見了它多少爲之「眼明」的。當然，我也是一樣，每次在雪前，便會摹擬到蘇東坡的「光瑤銀海眩生花」，和張元昊的「戰退玉龍三百萬，敗鱗殘田滿天飛」，那一些詩中意味。然而，每次對於它，我終沒有引起什麽「烟司披里純」，不知怎樣地，我只有摹擬，幻想，不知是它美妙得難以形容了呢？還是霏微背後挾着的一股寒威噤住了我。不過，我也同每個人一樣，愛好着它的。</p>
<p>今天的雪，愈其使我們愛好了，因爲一個年頭過去了，雪，等於遲臨的芳蹤，還是第一次枉駕，望眼穿了的人心會怎樣地歡呼：「雪，終於下來了」！</p>
<p>我愛好它，披了雨衣出門，走向那霏微當中感覺很輕鬆，不像下雨天，重濁的雨珠襲擊得難受，這時，展開限前的是一片白，美妙的白，我想不出再好的句子去禮讚它，除了想起羊孚的雪贊：「資淸以化，乘氣以霏，遇象能鮮，即潔成暉」以外。是的，我所有的只是幻想，譬如它本身一現即滅的幻相。實在，從前人就比我們聰明，所謂「天公玉戲」，已指出它的幻，還有「也知不作堅牢玉」一句，更說明了終究不能當玉看的。爲什麽現在有許多，侷促寒簷的窮措大，可以充饑或者派用塲呢？</p>
<p>幻想的悲哀！</p>
<p>但霏微的雪終究比重濁的雨好，它的質雖然那麼輕，那麼無力，而漫天的能够一致步驟，暫時讓一片白遮沒了大地的黑窟窿。尤其今天的雪，飛過了，一切的地面，屋瓦，樹木，眞個「即潔成暉」，也因爲不濫，幾個鐘頭就停止，適巧把通朝的雨悶和泥濘之路都掃淸了。</p>
<p>固然，氣溫因之驟冷了起來，嗚呼，——雪霏霏兮有客溫袍！（一月八日雪後）</p>

<h3>廢年廢話</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>中華民國成立了三十六年，改用陽曆做國曆，也有三十六年，可是民閒社曾對於舊膳的習慣，還有相當的一時絕不容易消滅的普遍潛在勢力，任你用萬鈞之力，也沒有方法去消滅他。習慣，可說是異常的頑固。</p>
<p>「爆竹一聲除舊，桃符萬戶更新。」廢曆的新春和歲闌的分判，就在這幾聲爆竹來劃時代。儘管人們提早兩三天貼　聯，可是，不到時候，大家爆竹不響，還是殘年。</p>
<p>「國恩家慶，人壽年豐」的春聯，雖然是含着點封建主義的色彩，可是這表示「昇平世紀」的景象。人們所希望的，在國家方面，是海宇昇平；在家庭，是安慶和樂。個人呢，健康長壽，而不是多病和夭折。農家，自然是企求風調雨順的豐收；這樣的景象，無疑的是大衆心裏共同的所切望。可是現在是怎樣呢，你想想，我想想！爲什麽到了這個境地？</p>
<p>「一年之計在於春，一日之計在於晨。」我們迎接新春的來臨，是含有深切的意義，嚴寒肅殺的殘冬，它要崩潰了；春風和靄，萬　昭蘇，是表示由華民族復興新機的發芽，個人也是如此的希望吧！</p>
<p>廢曆年在社會，我曾說它有頑固的廣泛的潛在勢力，任你怎樣的和它不發生關係，可是四周的空氣襲擊，不能不使你發生一點的影響，這是不可掩飾的事實。同時也可以證明一個傳統的習慣（無論好與不好的），自有他客觀的條件存在的理由。廢曆年被宣判死刑三十六年了，它還是頑固的盤踞存在。從這一點看來，便知道一個舊習慣的改革，是漸進的，不是急進的。同時知道掃除（改革）一種舊習慣，是要用很大的決心與努力，纔能够辦得到。廢曆在中國的社會間，尤其是在廣大的農民方面，只是一個休息簡期而已，並不是屬於迷信的舉動。</p>
<p>有人說，辛亥革命，最大的收成，要算男子的普遍剪辮，其他多是失敗。這句話，可說是有相當的道理。</p>
<p>現在採用廢曆干支紀年的，除了一部分工商農和僧道之外，還有一部分的書畫家與詩詞家。他們有些是執政的當局，在公文書上全用國曆，甚至具名行文禁用廢曆，但他在書畫詩詞上，有些還是寫用陰曆的干支紀年，不知是什麽原因？</p>
<p>寫件而用民國紀年的，只有葉恭綽柳亞子等幾個人，柳呢，除了用國曆之外，且多用公曆，這是有時代性的了。</p>
<p>香港·澳門的報紙。有些除了國曆之外，並有陰曆並列，新舊同參，據說是便利當地的市民。如「中華民國三十六年一月二十二日」，而他另一版面是排印「丁亥年正月初一日」，使有些人們看了，別有一個感想。</p>
<p>說來說去，政治未上軌道，來談一切改革，多是畸形的，也不是一蹴可幾的。在冬暮春初來談廢曆新正，似乎有點注意廢曆的嫌疑。在這陰陽怪氣的季節，來說廢曆年話，就算廢話吧。</p>

<p>鶴見從近衛那裏出來，「〇八」號野猪和汽車，仍舊好好地候在別府門外。</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？」鶴見焦切的問着。</p>
<p>「失敗了！」野猪無精打采的答應。</p>
<p>「究竟怎麼樣？」鶴見急於明瞭過去的一切。</p>
<p>「安坂在九點左右得到緊急警吿，勸我們停止行動；是萍子發來的。但我們仍舊進行；在三十六町十字路口，圓子的小綫跑來，也阻止我們進行，說一切佈置，都發生了變化。這，我們受到大困難了。爲愼重計，安坂發令總退却，不然的話，連一切將來的佈置都要破壞。……</p>
<p>「到三十町轉角，剛要解散人員，忽然發覺受了包圍。萍子出來吿訴我們，說是一切不違反我們的計劃，只要我們有勇氣跟他們合作。又告訴我們，除了技術人員以外，別的實力都用不着。我們答應了條件，只有三個人參加他們的集團；安坂留下了三四處伏綫，預備給你一個警吿，後來發現有第五縱隊的秘密崗位，所以立刻又把伏綫撤消；最重大的原因，還是由於萍子担保，祝你毫無危險。……</p>
<p>「我們的三個人三，七，十一，跟着他們的集團，繞大圈子，從『苦土』廢園，跨到雄本寺，從雄本寺襲進了別府；我們的圓子和他們幾個內綫，接應三個技術人員，探進地下室，沒有發生大困難。貨品也找到了；打開封套，可是只有幾張白紙。安坂疑心紙上用的化麼墨水，上野說絕對不會，因爲那是國際要件，不能應用隱跡墨水。回身出來的時候，發現出口活門背後，掛着一張字條，『枉費心機』；……」</p>
<p>第二天上午十時半，鶴見又到了軍用機塲。事前，參謀本部得到近衛的手條，「鶴見玉着晋級上校實銜，大陸參謀總部特務行動課助理，兼電訊課主任」從前的正職，現在改爲兼職，恐怕第二步就是撤消兼職了。因爲受了本部的緊急命令，所以鶴見再度跨上了西渡的飛機。</p>
<p>剛一跨進了飛機，鶴見一眼發現了兩個嬌艷如花的靑年女子，安安靜靜的各據一座；其中之一，對鶴見點首微笑，同時却給了鶴見一個暗示，呌他不要談話。那當然又是萍子了。鶴見一見萍子，立刻感覺到極度的不安，　像　上扎進了一根芒刺。剛一坐定，萍子的信號來了，她同鶴見平排坐着，當中隔開一條狹窄的過道，她的左手捬在自己膝頭上，正避開着另外那個女子的視綫。</p>
<p>「大哥，不必十分注意我的手！」萍子用指頭敲出了密碼。</p>
<p>「她是誰？」鶴見也一樣把右手　在對座那個女子增不見的地點，這般問着。</p>

<h3>廢止壓歲錢　改送兒童禮物</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢</p>
<p>陰曆新年，俗習以金錢饋贈兒童，名之曰「壓歲錢」。「壓歲錢」的含義，是鎭壓兒童一歲「太平」之謂，不知誰是始作俑者？</p>
<p>但是在現代改良風俗之下，我們對壓歲錢的意義，雖然不十分的反對，但亦不敢讚同提倡！</p>
<p>要知世界上的人類，所發生的「鬥爭」，「傾軋」，一切的一切，都是爲了「錢」，兒童智識未開，貿然的啓着這種錢的作用，殊與這「壓歲」兩字有些不合邏輯！</p>
<p>尤其是在這「新歲」，街頭的五光十色，玩具，糖果，　砲等，孩童一有了錢，背着家長，妄意的購買，有則吃着不潔或不消化的糖果，有則買了不良的玩具，使孩意們受到了這種「壓歲錢」間接的影響，甚則吃出了毛病，或闖了禍！</p>
<p>所以「壓歲錢」的習俗，愛兒童適足以害兒童，但是爲了牢不可破的習俗，一般人明知有害而年常如此，我們應該登高一呼，予以「廢止」才是！</p>
<p>往往在社曾上的一個人，爲金了錢會泯沒理智，忘掉廉恥，何况一個小小心靈的孩童，啓着他們「有錢可以玩吃」的觀念，這一種僥倖的心理，實在是不可取的！因爲在新春的時期中，中國社會盛行着「賭博」，大街小巷，隨地有引誘兒童的惡魔，所以予兒童「壓歲錢」，實有「百害而無一利」！</p>
<p>我希望社曾人士，把這「壓歲錢」的習俗廢止！改送「兒童書報」，及「智慧玩具」，以養成高尙的智識，正是爲我們下一代着想，及國家社稷的關係，不得不「高聲疾呼」的啊！</p>
<h3>誰說舊年關難過　街頭巷尾喜洋洋</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>陽關究竟敵不過陰關。</p>
<p>馬路上頻添了許多「紅」的顏色，賣「壓歲錢」封袋的俯拾即是，一千元十只，五百元十只沿街呌賣，這「紅」的顏色，反映出許多人充滿着「快樂」，許多人抱着「愁苦！」</p>
<p>賣橘子的攤販，沿街塞巷，大紅色的福橘，黃澄澄的汕頭蜜橘，一隻隻一攤攤，眞是多麼的美麗顏色，使人多麼可愛！</p>
<p>在城隍廟，新城隍廟，望平街……可以算得賣「歲朝淸供」的車楊，黃黃的臘梅花，盆景中含苞的古梅，一棵棵紅潤可愛的天竹子，買花的大多是有錢人家的少奶奶們，特地坐了三輪車，包車，汽車前來，賣花的沒有一定價錢，要看買主的「派頭」而定。今年的一枝天竹或臘梅，極普通的也需一二萬元錢，在窮人們沒有這個「雅興」，根本也不配「淸供」！</p>
<p>小孩子的玩具，也是在這個時期「吃香」的日子，汽球，刀槍，花燈……花花綠綠，孩子們看見了誰不歡喜？尤其是「劈拍」之聲，摜砲一連串的刺進人們的耳膜。</p>
<p>公司中糖果部的生意最鬧猛，南貨舖子，更見得擠來水洩下通，「年夜」，「新歲」，是「吃的季節」，「玩的日子」，我們到外邊逛一下，又那裏會見得是「鬧窮」呢？「年糕」，「美酒」，「橘子」，「鷄呀」，「魚呀」，「肉呀」，一紮紮，一　籃，到處充滿着「年忙」的景况，人人多的是「錢」，這樣的「奢侈」！</p>
<p>一切的物價，都比十天前抬高了許多，上海人所謂「殺年夜」是也，但習俗難返，只有「張着眼睛吃老鼠藥」！</p>
<p>下要說物價乘時崛起，就是小三子的黃包車，也莫不利市十倍，比往日索　加上「三分之一」。</p>
<p>在年三十夜，城隍廟，虹廟，都擠得人山人海，燒星宿香……一縷縷的香烟，把眼睛都燻得淌着淚，「老闆香燭要哦」？如果走到城隍廟，虹廟的左右，這些三冬靠一春的賣香燭者，從年三十夜到元宵，眞是他們賺錢的好光陰。</p>
<p>但是一切的一切，不論大的小的，男的，女的，尤其是做小生意的，希望在歲暮和新正，天公作美，這倒是第一個條件，唯有「落雨」，使做小生意都「叫苦」起來！</p>
<h3>米高梅新片「錦繡天堂」中茀雷亞斯坦與露茜白　梅之舞蹈塲面</h3>
<h3>補白　「我」在那兒</h3>
<p>— 乃人</p>
<p>「我」在那兒？它多大？多高？什麽相貌形客？也向未聞其談笑聲，和脚步聲，只是一直跟着你，年齡與你一樣不大不小。</p>
<p>「我」究在那兒？當你與人談話時，不是時常說「他問我？」「那東西是我的，」而手指指着鼻尖嗎？且決不會指到眼睛或耳朶上去，這時「我」應在鼻尖上。</p>
<p>當與人家相　吵架的時候，常會拍着胸膛，至屬着「媽的。我怕你，」這時「我」應到了胸膛，也不會到小腹大腿上去的。</p>
<p>其他處都不大發現它的踪跡，這終身伴着我們的「我」，我們應當發覺它，抓住它，把握它，不讓它無影無聲地虛度了這一生。</p>
<h3>一個命案</h3>
<p>— 威廉</p>
<p>這是Bagdad地方發生的一件人命案子。</p>
<p>人行道上有一個不當心的行人被一塊石頭絆倒，跌死了。</p>
<p>馬路上擠滿了人，有人去報吿法官。</p>
<p>法官很着急，因爲兇手不知是誰。</p>
<p>法官呌法警去把離石頭最近的一所房子的主人捉來治罪。</p>
<p>房主說：「至高無上的法官！我是無罪的！因爲那石頭是石匠遺忘下來的，他昨天曾爲我修理房子。」</p>
<p>法官於是把房主釋放，並命人把石匠捉來治罪。</p>
<p>石匠說：「至高無上的法官！我是寃枉的！我工作的時候，突然有一位極美麗的女郎走過，她的可愛，她的美髮，她的充滿了曲綫的身材，以及她那最最出色的一件藍色艷服吸引了我！……她的衣服的顏色太動人了，我不能克制自己，只有忘了工作跟着她去看個飽了。所以健忘石頭在人行道上的責任不在我而在那女郎！」</p>
<p>法官於是宣布石匠無罪，並命人把女郎捉來治罪。</p>
<p>女郎說：「至高無上的法官！我是無辜的！老天生我美麗，並不是我的過失。至於使石匠心醉的那件藍色衣服那也不是我自己作的，那該是裁縫的責任！」</p>
<p>法官於是命人將裁縫捉來治罪。</p>
<p>裁縫說：「至高無上的法官！我不過把幾塊料子用綫縫在一起罷了，料子又不是我織的，這責任應在紡織工人身上。」</p>
<p>法官於是把織工捉來治罪。</p>
<p>織工說：「至高無上的法官！料子雖是我織的，這動人的顏色不能怪我，這責任應在染店工人身上。」</p>
<p>法官只好再去把染工捉來治罪。</p>
<p>染工說：「至高無上的法官！這染料並不是我發明的，這是我們幾代傳授下來的，而且也有打外國來的……」</p>
<p>但法官不要再聽下去了，他認爲染工是有罪的，於是吩咐將他絞刑。</p>
<p>過了一回，法警突然回來說</p>
<p>「至高無上的老爺啊！我們的絞刑架子紋不死他，因爲他太高了。」</p>
<p>「放了他再去找一個矮子來好了。」法官不耐煩地說。（釋自「皇冠雜誌」）</p>

<h3>Deeply Hope the CCP Will Exercise Mutual Tolerance for the Sake of the Country, Abandon Preconceived Notions, and Continue Negotiations: The Government Announces a Plan to Resume Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Central Propaganda Department released the following statement on the afternoon of January 20th regarding the government's desire for peace negotiations and its progress: The National Government's greatest goal is to implement constitutional government and complete national construction. Therefore, it has been seeking the peaceful unification of the country at all times. As early as the initial stage of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to unite the strength of the entire country, it recruited people from various parties and social elites to establish the National Political Council. Regarding the CCP issue, the government has always considered it a political issue. Therefore, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang on November 10, 1942, and the Central Executive Committee on September 11, 1943, both unanimously advocated using political methods to seek a quick solution. The continuous negotiations between the government and the CCP representatives after May 1944 were aimed at obtaining a political solution. When the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association convened on March 1, 1945, Chairman Chiang reiterated that the CCP issue must be resolved peacefully as soon as possible and proposed three steps for the implementation of constitutional government, because the CCP issue, if unresolved, is a major obstacle to national unification and all construction. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang telegraphed an invitation to CCP leader Mao Zedong to come to Chongqing for negotiations. Finally, on October 10 of the same year, both parties signed the "Double Tenth Agreement" and expressed that they would continue to negotiate on the basis of mutual trust and mutual concession in order to achieve a satisfactory result. Since the convening of the Political Consultative Conference at the beginning of last year, the government and the Communist Party have negotiated on various issues such as military affairs and transportation. In various stages, General Marshall of the Allied United States has made many efforts to promote various agreements. The Chinese and foreigners alike eagerly anticipated the common</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference was originally an important decision in the "Double Tenth Agreement." It was convened on January 10, 1946, in Chongqing, the wartime capital. Regarding all the agreements, the government has repeatedly declared and the Kuomintang Second Central Executive Committee has resolved that "they are willing to cooperate with all parties and people from all walks of life with the greatest sincerity to promote its implementation." However, many of the PCC resolutions have not been implemented in the past year due to the following facts:</p>
<p>(1) According to the Sino-Soviet Agreement, the nine northeastern provinces should have been taken over by the National Government. When the Soviet army began to withdraw, the government sent troops to station in the Northeast. The CCP troops obstructed in many ways and occupied various places in Liaobei that had been taken over by the government in mid-March, and attacked Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places. In order to fulfill treaty obligations and maintain the sovereignty of the takeover, the government had to make the "March 27 Northeast Truce Agreement." However, after repeated mediation, there was still no result. The Northeast issue has not been resolved smoothly to this day, and the National Assembly, which was decided by the Political Consultative Conference to be convened on May 5, has also been postponed.</p>
<p>(2) After the government returned to Nanjing in May last year, the conflicts in the Northeast intensified and the transportation in North China remained disrupted. From June 7th, the government and the CCP ordered a ceasefire for 15 days. An agreement was about to be reached on three matters: completely stopping the conflicts in the Northeast, restoring domestic transportation, and implementing the military reorganization plan. Unexpectedly, although the ceasefire order was extended three times, the CCP occupied Dezhou, Tai'an, and other places during the ceasefire period, and besieged Datong and Jinan and the periphery of Qingdao. Therefore, the agreement drafted by both parties could not be effectively resolved.</p>
<p>(3) Before the convening of the National Assembly in November, the government, in view of the unrest and instability in the country and the urgent desire for peace of the people across the country, and feeling the sincere hope expressed by various parties and non-party individuals to stop the conflict as soon as possible, proposed eight understandings to the Communist Party on October 16 in order to order a ceasefire and convene the National Assembly as scheduled to formulate a constitution. Although third-party individuals ran around to mediate and proposed a compromise plan, the government repeatedly expressed its willingness to make concessions. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party firmly opposed the compromise plan and demanded the suspension of the National Assembly, which led to a standstill.</p>
<h3>According to the Decision of the Committee of Three, There Is No Need to Dispute the Military Positions</h3>
<p>The Passage of the Draft Constitution Is Also in Accordance with the Principles of the Political Consultative Conference</p>
<p>After the National Assembly, the government, with the constitutional implementation scheduled, was eager to resume peace talks and conveyed to the CCP through US Ambassador Stuart that the government was willing to send personnel to Yan'an to continue negotiations. However, the CCP's response was still to restore the military positions before January 13 last year and to abolish the constitution formulated by the National Assembly as preconditions. However, it is not known that the military positions before January 13 last year have changed greatly due to the passage of time, and the areas that the government has recovered. Once withdrawn, the lives and property of the people in the area will have no support. Restoring order and protecting the people is the duty of the government. How can we bear to let the people suffer the tragedy of revenge and murder again? If the Communist Party is sincere in peace, it can implement the reorganization and unification plans that have been established by the Committee of Three, then there is no need to dispute the temporary military positions. As for the abolition of the constitution, the National Assembly for formulating the constitution was composed of representatives of all ethnic groups, provinces, cities, and occupations across the country, and the PCC resolution had already stipulated that various parties and social elites would also participate together. It is by no means as the CCP claims that it was monopolized by the Kuomintang. Moreover, the constitution it passed is also the draft constitution agreed upon by the PCC, in which the Communist Party and various parties participated together, and the draft constitution formulated by the Constitution Drafting Committee based on those principles. The CCP has no reason to oppose it.</p>
<p>New Program Content</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, it can be seen that the government has spared no effort to compromise for the sake of national peace and unity, in the hope of introspection by the CCP. Because "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics" are the goals jointly adhered to by the Political Consultative Conference, if the CCP can sincerely practice them, it should not stubbornly adhere to prejudices and have doubts. In short, more than a year has passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and peaceful unification cannot be delayed any longer. It is deeply hoped that the CCP will understand the government's hard work in exercising mutual tolerance for the sake of the country and striving for a political solution, abandon preconceived notions, and continue negotiations. The government is still willing to make the greatest concessions and sincerity, and humbly accept, and hereby reveals the plan to restore peace again as the basis for continuing peace talks and reorganizing the government. The plan is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The government is willing to send personnel to Yan'an or invite the CCP to send personnel to Beijing to continue negotiations, or hold a round table meeting, inviting various parties and social elites to participate.</p>
<p>(2) The government and the CCP should immediately order a ceasefire on the spot and negotiate effective measures for the ceasefire.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the reorganization of the army and the restoration of transportation, the government is still willing to continue negotiations on the principles of the past agreement of the Committee of Three on the location of the army, the reorganization procedures, and the implementation measures for the restoration of transportation.</p>
<p>(4) Before the implementation of the constitution, the government is willing to negotiate with the Communist Party to determine a fair and reasonable solution for the local governments in the disputed areas. (End)</p>
<h3>There Is No Legal Problem with Our Country Taking Over Dalian</h3>
<p>Xiong Shihui Studies in Beijing</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] According to information from political and military circles, there is no legal problem with taking over Dalian. The difficulty lies in how to enable the national army to take over smoothly without causing the destruction of wealth and lives, as the Communist army has appeared and is active in Dalian. After Xiong Shihui came to Beijing, China and the Soviet Union are carefully studying the takeover technology. However, the outcome may change with the domestic political situation.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Government, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Youth Party Meet for Talks</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Lei Zhen visited Zhang Dongsun briefly at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, and then went to Zhang Junmai's residence. At that time, those gathered at Zhang's residence included Wu Dingchang, Wang Shijie, and Zhang Qun from the government; Zhang Junmai, Xu Chuanlin, Wu Xianzi, Wan Renqian, and Jiang Yuntian from the Democratic Socialist Party. They continued to discuss the issue of reorganizing the government. At noon, the entire group went to Sun Ke's residence to attend Sun's dinner invitation. At the same time, Zeng Qi and Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party also arrived. They exchanged many opinions during the meeting. In the evening, Lei hosted a banquet at his private residence for Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Sun Ke, and Zhang Zhizhong. The dinner ended at 9:00 p.m., and Sun immediately returned to his residence to pack his belongings and take the night train to Shanghai. The other four went to Zhang Junmai's residence for a long conversation, which ended at around 10:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Hosts Journalists</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Soviet Ambassador Petrov hosted a banquet at the ambassador's residence at 7:00 p.m. on the 20th to entertain the press in Beijing. They had brief social conversations during the meeting, and the gathering ended happily at around 8:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>National Government Orders</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The National Government issued an order on the 21st: (1) Appointed Cao Fengxiao concurrently as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

(4) Chen Shujun, the chief accountant of the Guizhou Provincial Government, has other appointments and should be relieved of his current position. (5) Wang Bi, a technician of the Ministry of Interior who was on probation, has other appointments and should be dismissed.</p>
<h3>The US Ambassador Is Waiting for an Opportunity to Re-explore Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Reliable sources in China stated that US Ambassador Stuart is currently inquiring about the opinions of the government and the CCP on the current situation in order to determine a suitable opportunity to re-explore peace.

<h3>The Democratic League Proposes Four Suggestions for the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Advocates for Re-negotiating and Establishing a Coalition Government</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Democratic League held a press conference at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 2:30 p.m. on the 20th. Zhang Junmai, Xian Ying, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and others attended. Luo Longji presented the Democratic League's declaration on the current situation and explained the main points.</p>
<p>The Declaration Is Divided into Six Points</p>
<p>The declaration is more than 16,000 words in length and is divided into six parts: The first part explains the nature, purpose, and working methods of the Democratic League, stating: The Democratic League is an "independent political group" whose "purpose is to realize democracy in China," and its primary task is to "mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in order to achieve national unity, unification, and peace." The second part reviews last year's peace talks and believes that failure to resolve the Northeast issue was the source of the PCC's failure. The Democratic League opposed such a loss at that time. Luo emphasized that the spirit of the PCC resolution lies in the process of implementing the PCC resolution. Therefore, if a coalition government is not formed to jointly implement various resolutions, and a one-party government implements them, the spirit of the PCC has been destroyed. The third part is an analysis of domestic problems, with emphasis on the economic aspect, and the suffering of the people is the main topic of discussion. The fourth part studies the international situation, pointing out that the failure of Marshall's mediation should be attributed to the mistakes of the US policy towards China and hoping to correct it. It also specifically points out the short-sightedness of a few people in the United States who want to support Japan in order to dominate Asia. The fifth part reviews last year's democratic movement, with special attention to the losses of the Democratic League members.</p>
<p>Three Conditions for Peace Talks</p>
<p>The sixth part is the conclusion, which believes that there are three preconditions for resuming peace talks, namely: (1) The government should first and foremost protect the people's freedom. (2) The government should first and foremost end all long-term war preparations. The CCP should also stop full mobilization in order to stabilize society and show the CCP's sincerity in seeking peace. (3) The government should earnestly recognize and respect the equal and legal status of parties. After the preconditions are met, the Democratic League has four suggestions for the current situation: (1) Strive to promote peace talks and oppose the method of "reorganizing the government and then seeking to restore peace" because it will cause "long-term civil war and permanent division." (2) Re-hold political consultation, and the necessary conditions for this consultation are: the power must be higher than the participating parties, and the scope of discussion must include all national political, military, economic, and other issues. The separation of political and military solutions and the discussion of central political institutions without addressing local institutions in last year's PCC are now considered to be mistakes. (3) Implement the previous PCC resolutions because last year's PCC resolutions are nothing less than China's Magna Carta, a contract jointly signed by all parties that must be trusted and observed together. (4) Establish a coalition government. This coalition government is a coalition government in which "the whole country is united and all parties have equal participation," including local governments.</p>

<h3>The Xisha Islands Issue Is Expected to Be Resolved Peacefully</h3>
<p>Minister Bai Reports at the Commemoration Week</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] A reporter visited a spokesperson for a relevant authority on the 20th about rumors that the French army was attempting to land on the Xisha Islands by force. It was reported that some French officials had indeed made this attempt in the past, and French warships had sailed close to the Xisha waters. They left after being warned by our garrison troops. The wise men of the French side also ordered a halt to such behavior. At present, the situation in the Xisha Islands has not changed much, and there will be no armed conflicts. Qian Tai, our ambassador to France, recently issued a statement of sovereignty again in Paris. The government's position is very clear and firm. It is expected that the French side will not make mistakes and cause political disputes over this small island with no economic value, which will affect the friendly relations between China and France.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 20th] Defense Minister Bai Chongxi gave a speech at the Commemoration Week on the morning of the 20th, reviewing the Xisha Islands issue and discussing the recent landing of French troops on the island. According to well-informed sources here, a French warship sailed to the Xisha Islands a few days ago, and a small team of French troops landed on its main island and demanded that the Chinese garrison on the island withdraw, but was rejected by the commander of the garrison. The Chinese and French governments are currently negotiating on this matter, with each side arguing for historical and diplomatic reasons. However, the relations between the two countries are good, so it is unlikely that this "small problem" will cause trouble, and this matter will soon be reconciled.</p>

<h3>Incident of a U.S. Soldier Raping a Female Student in Beiping: Debate Court Scheduled for Today; Twelve U.S. Witnesses Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Bureau, 20th] A heavy snow fell in Beiping City on the 20th. On the third day of the public trial of the U.S. soldier's atrocity case, the Chinese defense witnesses have finished their testimonies. Today, the U.S. witnesses presented by the defendant will be interrogated, totaling twelve individuals. Among them, five were present at the scene, two were U.S. medical officers who examined Ms. Shen Chong, and some others testified regarding the number of passersby, sound levels, and lighting on the streets near the incident location on the evening of the 13th (details omitted). Although these witnesses presented testimonies today that were generally favorable to Pearson, there were many inconsistencies in their statements. (1) The U.S. officer on duty at the Sino-American Police Liaison Office that night and other U.S. military police who arrived at the scene claimed they did not hear anyone accusing Pearson of "rape" that night. However, one heard someone using Chinese to say the words "rape." (2) Among the five military police who were present at the scene, two stated that after the police and military police arrived, they saw Pearson still with his hand on Ms. Shen's shoulder, one saying it lasted for ten minutes, and the other saying the time was very short. Another said he saw the hand on Ms. Shen's waist, while the other two, one said he did not see it, and the other said he did not pay attention. (3) The U.S. soldier who went out with Pearson that afternoon said that Pearson had been drinking and was drunk, and that his hand was scratched by a glass, providing an explanation for Pearson's hand injury. (4) The medical officer examined Ms. Shen's injuries twice, once at 8:00 AM on the 25th and the second time on the 5th of this month. The first examination revealed that Ms. Shen's hymen was ruptured, and there were three small lacerations at the entrance of the vagina, totaling half an inch in length. The surfaces of the wounds were red and broken, and the wounds were one-eighth of an inch wide. Otherwise, no injuries were found. Later, Shen informed them that there were still injuries that had not been examined, so they went to examine her again and found four injuries on her left leg, but they had already scabbed over. Subsequently, the defense lawyer and the prosecuting attorney questioned each other for a considerable period, mutually protesting that the medical officer admitted that the injuries could have occurred on the 24th. The defense lawyer asked whether normal sexual intercourse could cause such injuries, and the response was that it was possible, but under certain conditions, and only if there had not been many instances of sexual intercourse previously. They also asked if the injuries could have been caused by the first examination (referring to the examination by Dr. Wang Hecheng), and the answer was "possible." The prosecuting attorney then asked if, from a physician's ethical standpoint, it should be disclosed to subsequent examiners if the injuries were caused during the first examination, and the answer was "it should." The defense lawyer further asked, "Could Ms. Shen have had sexual intercourse before the 24th?" The answer was "Unable to answer," but stated, "It is safe to say that she had not had it many times before." After the prosecuting attorney protested the scope of this question, the second sentence was withdrawn. Finally, Ms. Shen's long wool coat and white pants were presented as evidence in court, and it was announced that the debate court would be held on the 21st. It was also learned that Shen's side will submit as supplementary evidence on the 21st the shrunk coat worn on that day, which is being chemically tested at Peking University Hospital.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 20th] Regarding the atrocity case of a U.S. soldier against Peking University student Shen Chong, U.S. military police officer Lieutenant Colonel Ward used Chinese in the U.S. military court to defend the defendant, stating: Chinese police and the victim did not accuse the defendant Pearson of rape on the night of his arrest. It was only on the following day that the U.S. military police were notified that Miss Shen had accused him of rape. The Chinese police only told him that Pearson was "apprehended with a young woman on the playing field." Ward also testified: Pearson was intoxicated. The other eight witnesses for the defendant also testified that the defendant was intoxicated. U.S. Navy medical officer Captain Clark, who examined Ms. Shen, testified that he found only three small abrasions at the entrance of Ms. Shen's vagina on the day after the incident. These abrasions could have occurred during normal sexual intercourse or a previous examination. If the woman had resisted, the injuries would have been greater. No other injuries were found on the woman's body, and Miss Shen also stated that there were no other injuries. Nine days later, Ms. Shen requested another examination, and three small abrasions were then found on her leg.</p>

<h3>No Major Changes in the Lunan Battle Situation; Traffic on the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway Restored; No Traces of Communist Troops Near Yongcheng</h3>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Bureau, 20th] There are no traces of Communist troops near Yongcheng; there are still minor skirmishes around Jinxiang.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Bureau, 20th] There are no major changes in the Lunan battle situation. Although the Communist troops continue to attack Zaozhuang, they have all been repelled. The Communist troops' offensive is now on the decline, and morale within the ranks is wavering, with soldiers surrendering to the National Army with their weapons. Zaozhuang is as solid as a rock, and the war situation will have a new turning point in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu Bureau, 20th] More than 50 Communist troops have gathered in the Lucheng Chadian area, attempting to attack Shenqiu. The Communist troops are only over 80 li away from Linquan, and the situation on the Anhui border is becoming serious.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] After the National Army advanced into Xin'an Town between Xuzhou and Haizhou, traffic on the eastern section of the land and sea routes has been restored.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] (1) The Communist troops in Lunan are currently attacking Zaozhuang with all their strength. For the past two days, they have been charging fiercely at the National Army day and night. The battle situation is extremely intense. As of this morning, Zaozhuang is still firmly defended by the National Army. (2) The National Army on the south side of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is advancing towards the railway line. One unit arrived at Xin'an Town on the 19th. The eastern railway line defeated the resistance of the Communist troops, capturing a large number of enemy soldiers. At 10:30 AM on the same morning, another unit of the National Army recovered Xin'an Town. The remaining Communist troops, consisting of units of the New Sixth Division and the Seventh Division, fled towards Tancheng. (3) More than 1,000 troops from a unit of the Communist Ninth Division crossed the canal near Yaowan on the evening of the 18th and attacked Xiaoji on the 19th. According to the security forces, there is also a unit of Communist troops near Yantou. After being driven away by the National Army, they fled in panic.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th] According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense: "In the Subei area, since the National Army recovered Suqian and Shuyang, the war has largely ended. Over the past week, the National Army has arrived at the line of Niushan Station (about 35 kilometers west of Donghai), Ahu, Xin'an Town, Yaowan, and Guojiaji (all the above places are on the Longhai Line, except Yaowan) to pacify the local area. The main force of the Communist troops was defeated each time, with little resistance. Only a few hundred Communist troops briefly harassed Yaowan on the evening of the 18th, but they were repelled by the National Army. In addition, there has been no fighting behind the front line of the National Army. As for the Jingjiang, Taixing, and Taixian areas in Jiangbei, there are no Communist troops present.</p>
<h3>Communist Conspiracy in the Northeast Foiled; National Army Recovers Qitamu; Clearing Operations Underway North of the Jichang Railway</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 20th] A unit of the National Army recovered Qitamu at 4:00 PM yesterday. The Communist troops retreated to the northwest. The National Army in the Dehui area is also advancing eastward, echoing the National Army in the Qitamu area. Furthermore, the National Army on the east bank of the Songhua River recovered Baiqitun (70 li north of Wula Street) at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 20th] Military news: The Communist troops who crossed the river to attack southward have suffered considerable blows and heavy losses after being counterattacked by the National Army in recent days. Their New First and New Second Divisions, as well as the Jibei Military Region troops, were defeated northeast of Jiutai and retreated northward. Their Sixth Column and Sixth Division were successively defeated southeast of Dehui and southwest of Nong'an and fled in disarray. The Communist troops' winter offensive has now failed, and their attempt to occupy Changji and cut off the Jichang Line has been completely foiled.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 20th] The 16th and 17th Divisions of the Northeast Communist Sixth Column, totaling more than 10,000 troops, entrenched themselves in Hou Shigou, east of Dehui, on the 18th, relying on the terrain to resist stubbornly. Their Third Division, with more than 5,000 troops, entrenched itself near Dafangshen. Another unit of more than 30,000 Communist troops retreated to the Baiqitun area on the 17th. The National Army recovered Mushihe and Chengzi Street on the 17th and advanced to the line of Hanjialing Qianhenantun on the 18th. Xiajiadian, east of Dehui, was also recovered by the National Army on the 17th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 19th] According to a military official here speaking to reporters today: The Communist troops' offensive launched this time north of the Jichang Railway has been planned for a long time. At the end of last year, there were frequent movements in various places along the Songhua River. First, a test was made in Chen'an, which was repulsed after suffering losses. Then, forces were concentrated in an attempt to cut off the Jichang Railway in one fell swoop, damage the tunnels of Tumenling, and the coal mines of Yingchengzi, to isolate Jilin and then besiege it. However, due to the steadfastness of the few National Army troops on the outskirts of Jilin, the Communist troops suffered heavy casualties. Coupled with the National Army's reinforcements and counterattacks, their conspiracy was foiled. It is estimated that there have been more than ten battles, large and small, in the two weeks from the 6th to the 18th of this month. During this period, in addition to Hewan Ten Station being briefly occupied and burned, and the people in the war zone being sacrificed, looted, enslaved, and abducted, the Communist troops gained nothing. When the official spoke to reporters, he was still in contact with the front lines by telephone from time to time. The National Army is currently clearing the battlefield and pursuing the remnants of the Communist troops.</p>

Mr. Cai sent a letter through the U.S. representative to the Communist representatives, stating: The government believes that the military situation in Changchun is critical, and it cannot guarantee the safety of the Communist representatives who wish to return to Changchun from Beiping to investigate. As for the forced occupation of the radio station of the Changchun Communist delegation and the guarding of Communist personnel, the blame lies with a certain "adjutant." Restrictions on the Communist personnel have now been lifted, so this matter can be considered closed. The Communist side replied, publishing the second telegram sent by the Changchun Communist representatives, which stated: The radio station has been returned, but there is no electricity, and the Communist personnel are still restricted. The reply also revealed a new incident that occurred at the Beiping West Suburbs Airport today.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Jambi Suffered Heavy Losses; Our Consul General Convened a Meeting; Local Commander and Residents Will Attend</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 19th] The Dutch East Indies government issued a public statement tonight stating: According to the latest estimates by the Chinese Consul in Palembang, the number of Chinese casualties in the conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands there is as follows: 250 dead, 1,000 injured, 600 missing, and 900 homeless. The property losses of the overseas Chinese amounted to 5 million Straits dollars, of which 200,000 Straits dollars were due to Dutch East Indies actions, 1.5 million were due to Indonesian arson, and the rest were due to looting. Only 10% of the deaths and injuries were victims of Dutch shelling of Indonesia, and the majority were victims of Indonesian kidnapping and terrorism. The Dutch East Indies government deeply regrets the suffering of innocent civilians but pointed out that the Dutch actions were actually intended to prevent Indonesian snipers and terrorist policies. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this action was to protect citizens. The Dutch East Indies government has, in the past, provided assistance and protection to similar victims, such as evacuating thousands of refugees from Tanjung Balai, assisting refugees in Bagan Siapiapi, and helping to repatriate Chinese refugees in eastern Java. At the same time, Consul General Jiang Jiadong has already raised the Jambi incident with the Dutch East Indies authorities yesterday and will hold a meeting tomorrow, which will be attended by Jambi residents and the local commander. It is understood that Mr. Jiang will convene the overseas Chinese in Jambi in the near future to hear direct reports.</p>

<h3>Editorial: From the Xisha Islands to France's Colonial Policy</h3>
<p>According to reports, the French side has dispatched several warships carrying marines, preparing to sail to the Xisha Islands to land. The Chinese navy stationed on the islands has requested instructions from the Ministry of National Defense. Although this news has not been officially confirmed, judging from common sense, its reliability is quite high. Recently, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry declared on the 9th that France has always believed that the Xisha Islands belong to Vietnam, but before receiving an official report sufficient to prove that Chinese troops have occupied the Xisha Islands, the French government has not yet decided what action it will take. This passage was transmitted to China by Reuters, and after being published in the newspapers, public opinion was in an uproar. Reporters from various newspapers telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for inquiries, and Ye Gongchao, the Director of the European Department, replied: "The Chinese government has recovered the Xisha Islands from Japanese occupation. The sovereignty of the islands belongs to China, so there is no need to go through the formalities of requesting recovery from any party." From this, it can be seen that the Xisha Islands have become an object of contention between China and France.</p>
<p>The French side believes that the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands should belong to Vietnam, and its reasons are four: (1) The Kings of Annam repeatedly requested to obtain the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands in the 18th and 19th centuries, and they were only occupied by China in 1920, and their administrative power was划 into Hainan Island. In 1930, the Chinese government decided to exploit the resources of the Xisha Islands, but France, claiming to be the protector of the five countries of Annam, came out to express its objection, and said that France also wanted to take the same action. (2) France proposed a friendly settlement to China in 1937, and stated that if the Chinese government refused, it would ask a third country to arbitrate. (3) China agreed in 1938 that France would occupy the Xisha Islands in the name of the Kingdom of Annam, and the Vietnamese army only withdrew from the islands when the Japanese army occupied the islands in March 1945. (4) The Xisha Islands are very important in military strategy, but they were not used for military strategy during World War II.</p>
<p>The reasons provided by the French side are obviously insufficient and really have no value for defending. According to legal principles and facts, it is not difficult for us to prove that the Xisha Islands should belong to China: First, the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands belongs to China, which has a long history, and its administrative power is also assigned to Guangdong Province. Chinese fishermen must go to the Xisha Islands from Hainan Island every year to engage in fishing, and the Chinese navy also goes to patrol from time to time. Second, the Sino-French Treaty of Tianjin in 1858 has a map attached, which can prove that the Xisha Islands belong to China. Third, in 1908, the Chinese Customs proposed to build a lighthouse on the Xisha Islands for the safety of ships sailing; in 1930, when the International Meteorological Conference was held in Hong Kong, it was also proposed that the Chinese government set up a meteorological station on the Xisha Islands to facilitate navigation at sea. Fourth, between 1932 and 1938, the diplomatic authorities of China and France exchanged countless notes. In its repeated notes to the French Foreign Ministry, the Chinese government never expressed its abandonment of its sovereignty over the Xisha Islands; at the same time, it never recognized France's occupation of the Xisha Islands in the name of the Kingdom of Annam in 1938. Fifth, when France suddenly occupied my country's Tuansha Islands on July 25, 1933, Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, protested to the French government, stating that the islands are not only geographically part of the Xisha Islands, which form the territory of China, but also the majority of the inhabitants on the island are Chinese fishermen, so the sovereignty belongs to China, and France should return the islands to China. This note is really the most powerful evidence, and the French diplomatic authorities can turn out the previous files for review. I remember that at that time, the Japanese government also issued a statement on August 21 of the same year: "This occupation by France cannot be regarded as having taken effect in international law, and Japan expresses its firm opposition to France's occupation of the Tuansha Islands."</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that there is absolutely no doubt that the Xisha Islands belong to China; but now France is forcibly quibbling, trying to occupy the Xisha Islands in the name of Vietnam, and no matter from which angle you observe it, it is an unwise move by France, not only revealing that France still harbors imperialistic ambitions for its overseas colonies, but also this attempt will inevitably arouse the anger of the 450 million people of China! The relations between China and France have always been very friendly, especially during World War II, the positions of China and France were quite similar, so between the people of the two countries, there was a sense of "sympathy for each other," which made the friendship between the two countries more consolidated. After the war, the Chinese people were particularly concerned about the political situation in France; the first aircraft of the French airline that day, test-flew to Shanghai, and was warmly welcomed by the citizens of Shanghai. This is a powerful proof of the friendship between the Chinese and French people. In the future, China and France should find ways to promote the relations between the two countries, and all actions that may stimulate the emotions of the people of the two countries should be avoided as much as possible. Taking the current conflict between France and Vietnam as an example, although China sympathizes with the liberation movement of the Vietnamese people, it still maintains a neutral position in order to cherish the relations between China and France. This is China's expression of its willingness to maintain friendly relations with France. The London Times commented on France's colonial policy the day before yesterday, saying that it was similar to the policy of the Roman Empire. This unpleasant but sincere advice is worth considering by the French authorities. Whether this kind of colonial policy can conform to the trend of the times in the post-war peaceful and democratic world needs to be reconsidered!</p>

The four peace treaties, together with the peace treaty with Finland, will be officially signed in Paris on February 10. The United States has never declared war on Finland, so it cannot be one of the signatory countries. After Marshall succeeds as Secretary of State, he will take on the task of concluding peace treaties with Germany and Austria, and continue to work to resolve the China issue. Marshall must also work to rebuild peace and draft a peace treaty with Japan, and one of his most important tasks is to review the United States' policy toward the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>French Cabinet Formation Completed, Prime Minister Will Report to Parliament to Obtain Trust, Attitude of the People's Republican Party Still Quite Speculative</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London 20th Broadcast: Raudi, who was appointed to form the cabinet, will attend the National Assembly tomorrow, and will determine the list of candidates for the united cabinet, including five communists, five members of the People's Republican Party, and seven socialists.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 19th] Socialist Prime Minister Ramadier has completed the negotiations with leaders of various parties on cabinet formation, and officially reported to President Auriol that he has accepted the appointment. As soon as he gains the trust of the parliament, he will announce the list of ministers. According to a spokesperson for the People's Republican Party, Bidault has been internally determined to be re-elected as Foreign Minister, and has stated that France's policy toward Germany will remain unchanged. He has full authority to implement this policy when he attends the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March. Pidault also told Ramadier face-to-face that Blum recently contacted Britain and France in London, hoping to revise France's policy toward Germany, and he felt deeply disturbed by it. France's policy toward Germany has been criticized by US officials.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 19th] Although Ramadier has officially accepted the cabinet formation today, the attitude of the People's Republican Party makes it doubtful whether his cabinet formation mission can succeed in the end.

The Communist Party requested to obtain the position of Minister of National Defense, which Ramadier has agreed to. However, the People's Republican Party has proposed a counter-proposal to Ramadier, advocating that the Ministry of National Defense be divided into the Ministry of Military Equipment and the Ministry of Army, the position of Minister of Military Equipment should belong to the Communist Party, and the position of Minister of Army should belong to other political parties.</p>

<h3>An Englishman's View of Allied-Occupied Japan (4)</h3>
<p>— Original by John Morris, Translated by Zhang Deqian</p>
<p>(4) Education Problems</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the central issue of the entire occupation. General MacArthur repeatedly instructed the Japanese government to adopt democratic methods in every aspect of public and private life. I have already described the current achievements in this regard. The difficulty, as MacArthur himself said, lies in the essence of democracy. Democracy must gradually arise from the people's own desires. If democracy is implemented through purely autocratic methods, it is bound to fail. However, only by democratizing Japan first can the entire Far East issue be resolved.</p>
<p>Changing Mindsets Relies on Education</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is entirely a long-term educational problem. I am extremely doubtful that there is any way to change the mindset of Japanese adults. The true purpose of education is to create conditions that enable people to educate themselves. In Japan, I have not seen anything that would make me believe that Japanese adults have any intention of changing their ways. I fear that the eight million demobilized soldiers and sailors who recently returned to their home country will cause trouble. These people have been subjected to long-term mental conditioning by Japanese militarists, and their minds may not be able to change overnight. However, until I left Japan in July 1946, their behavior was so good that it could almost be called exemplary, which was truly unexpected. The reason they did not cause any trouble may be because most of them came from farming families, and Japanese farmers have not been as affected by the current widespread food shortage. However, this does not mean that they do not pose any potential danger.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Remold the Thinking of the Japanese People</p>
<p>I believe that if we want to complete the democratization of Japan and prevent their aggressive desires from reviving in the future, we should focus not on any short-term "re-education," but on a fundamental reorganization of the entire Japanese education system. This is obviously a very difficult task, but it is not impossible. The Japanese authorities also admit that the Japanese education system does need such a reorganization, but so far there has been little practical action. Those that have been effective are limited to purely negative work. Several subjects, such as history, geography, and ethics, are not allowed to be taught until new textbooks that eliminate all narrow-minded nationalism have been published. Some have suggested that the certificates of every Japanese teacher should be carefully reviewed to determine whether they are suitable for this profession. This seems very correct and very proper. Others have suggested that each Japanese teacher should be summoned for individual interviews, which is also very correct. However, there are approximately 414,000 teachers in elementary, middle, and high schools throughout Japan. It will take a very long time to clear this educational field so that we can sow new seeds. Current teachers and students cannot attend classes on time. This is partly due to the housing shortage everywhere, but more importantly, it is due to the general instability of life and the lack of any proactive policies by the authorities. In any case, these suggestions can only solve half of the problem. No one has yet suggested how to obtain new teachers to replace those who are deemed unsuitable (and of course, there are many teachers who are unsuitable) after they have been eliminated.</p>
<p>Long-Term Occupation is Necessary</p>
<p>I personally feel that this problem cannot be completely resolved without a long-term occupation. The occupation should be extended at least to include the education of two entire generations, so that they will not be influenced by reactionary elements when they enter public service in the future. Therefore, the occupation must be extended to fifteen to twenty years. However, the actual number of occupation troops can be greatly reduced. In fact, in the last few years of the occupation, a small and highly specialized regulatory commission would be sufficient.</p>
<p>Before the war, the Japanese government hired many foreign teachers to teach in Japan, especially in higher schools and universities. Most of them were British and American, and their influence was great, which cannot be measured by their numbers. This system should now be restored and expanded. We need a large number of qualified male and female teachers to teach in Japan. They must fervently believe in democracy and be prepared to spend part of their lives promoting the benefits of democracy.</p>
<p>During my trip to Japan, I felt that the young teachers and students in Japan were indeed asking us for help. The more clear-headed among them have begun to recognize that the entire Japanese education system does have its flaws. They cannot say exactly what is wrong, but they want to correct this mistake before their own education is completed. If we cannot satisfy their demands now, we and our descendants will inevitably suffer in the future. (The End)</p>

<h3>Qian Daqun is Spared No Death Penalty, Loses His Soul Upon Hearing the Sentence, His Crime is No Different From Zhou Ni's</h3>
<p>Family Members Cover Their Faces and Sob, Expressing Intent to Appeal</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Qian Daqun, the Deputy Governor of the False Central Reserve Bank, was sentenced to death by the High Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. When the criminal Qian was brought to the court, he was holding a gray Russian hat, wearing a dark blue silk-lined cotton gown, a wool scarf, yellow deerskin gloves, leggings, and black patterned leather shoes. He was led to the court by Chief of Police Hu. After Judge Liu questioned his name, age, and place of origin, he stood up and announced the main text of the judgment: "Qian Daqun, colluding with enemy countries, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life, all property, except for necessary living expenses for family members, confiscated." When Judge Liu loudly read the main text to "sentenced to death," the criminal Qian's face suddenly turned ashen, and his body trembled slightly. Then Judge Liu briefly explained the reasons for the judgment, saying: "The defendant Qian Daqun, under the instigation of the traitor Zhou Fohai, prepared to organize the False Central Reserve Bank, and served as 'Director' and 'Deputy Governor' of the bank. All of these roles, he has confessed without denial. His most prominent crime is to arbitrarily set the ratio of 'two to one,' forcing the people to exchange legal tender for counterfeit currency, and providing the enemy with more than 20 billion yuan in counterfeit currency, as well as purchasing a large amount of materials on behalf of the enemy. The total amount of counterfeit currency issued reached more than 4.6 billion yuan, disrupting finance, violating national policies, and undermining the war of resistance. His crimes are serious. Compared with the traitor Zhou Fohai, there is no difference, so he is sentenced to the death penalty. If he does not accept the judgment, he may apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment." Upon hearing this, the criminal Qian still stared blankly at the court, without saying a word, his lips trembling up and down. Two female family members of the defendant in the audience covered their faces and sobbed. When the court ordered him to be returned to custody, his family members followed behind, and the criminal Qian also frequently looked back, being escorted back to the Zhongjian Prison at a hurried pace. According to the family members of the criminal Qian, after receiving the judgment, they intend to apply for a retrial. According to the Shanghai High Court, the criminal Qian is the tenth traitor sentenced to death. (Among them, Liang Hongzhi has been executed, and the Supreme Court changed Ji Peijing's sentence to life imprisonment.)</p>
<h3>Shan Xinfa Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>

<h3>Second Batch of German Overseas Chinese to Return Next Month</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Foreign Affairs Office of the Municipal Government announced yesterday that the date for the repatriation of the second batch of German overseas Chinese has been set for February 15.

<h3>Request for Wider Limits on Industrial Electricity and Gas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the National Industries Association, due to the increasing difficulty in the supply of electricity and gas for industrial use, which has forced various factories to reduce production, which is greatly related to the entire future of the industry, has specifically put forward opinions and submitted documents to the Municipal Council, the Municipal Government, and the Public Utilities Bureau, requesting wider limits on electricity and gas to be granted in order to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3>Gui Zhongshu Invents the Directional Character Lookup Method</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Mr. Gui Zhongshu, a senior figure in the legal community of this city, has spent more than three years researching and inventing two methods, the "Directional Character Lookup Method" and the "Chinese Character Spelling Method," which have made great contributions to the study of phonology and linguistics. Mr. Gui, in view of the fact that in Chinese dictionaries that generally use the "radical method" for character lookup, there is no scientific principle for determining which radical a certain character should be classified under, which often wastes time when looking up characters, and improvement is indeed needed. Therefore, based on the principle of pictography, all radicals of characters are divided into five types: "priority," "exclusive," "separated," "connected," and "mixed." Whenever there is a priority radical, the lookup uses the priority radical; when there is no priority radical, the exclusive radical is used; when there is no exclusive radical, the separated radical is used, and so on. In this way, when looking up characters, one can "enter the hall" without mistakenly turning to other radicals. Also, because dictionaries use national phonetic alphabet only to indicate the even tone, the rising tone and departing tone of a character must be comprehended by the reader themselves, which is difficult to guarantee accuracy, it is proposed to use the Chinese character spelling method to indicate the rising, departing, and going tones of the rhyme according to the national phonetic alphabet, and no longer use the spelling method to pronounce. In this way, the rising, departing, and going tones can be accurate, and it can also facilitate foreigners or young children to learn. Mr. Gui has now submitted his work to the Ministry of the Interior for registration, and it is planned to adopt this new method of dictionary soon.</p>

<h3>The Case of the American Sailor Who Stabbed a Pedicab Driver with a Knife, First Public Hearing Yesterday, Defendant Claims Self-Defense, Female Bartender Called to Testify, Victim Brings Civil Suit Seeking Compensation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The case of Rogers, an American sailor on the UNRRA fishing boat "John," stabbing pedicab driver Cheng Rongfang with a knife at 10:00 PM on New Year's Day, was investigated and concluded by the District Attorney's Office, and a public prosecution was filed on charges of assault. Yesterday morning, the District Court held its first public hearing. Judge Wu Shaochang and Prosecutor Shen Zushou ascended the bench at 10:20 AM and brought the defendant Rogers to the court. After Prosecutor Shen stood up and delivered his accusation, the interrogation began. According to Rogers, he is 26 years old, an American citizen, and came to Shanghai in July last year. On September 12, he was hired by UNRRA to work on the fishing boat "John," with a monthly salary of 300 US dollars. At around 3:00 PM on January 1st this year, he and a friend went to the Haibin Bar on Dongda Ming Road for drinks. At 10:30 PM, he left with Wang Xiulan, a female bartender from the bar. Many pedicab drivers competed to solicit business. One of them threw an iron ring tied with a rope at him, causing injury to his forehead. For self-defense, he took out a knife and stabbed him. Witness Wang Xiulan was then called to testify. Wang testified that she is 22 years old, from Beiping. Rogers is a regular customer of our bar. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, when the bar closed and she hired a pedicab to go home, she saw Rogers arguing with the pedicab driver. The other three foreigners had already hired cars. She also said that Cheng Rongfang was indeed stabbed by Rogers, and she also saw blood on Rogers' forehead. The victim, Cheng Rongfang, was unable to recover from his injuries, so only his attorneys, Zhou Lianze and Chen Zhen, appeared in court to bring a civil suit seeking compensation for damages of 66.6 million yuan and all medical expenses. The US Deputy Consul General in Shanghai, William, and his legal consultant, Zhang Tianyin, attended the hearing. The hearing was adjourned until noon, and the court ordered the case to be reheard at a later date.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Zhijiang Ferry Disaster, The Handling of the Aftermath Has Been Determined, The Issue of Responsibility Will Be Investigated, The Meeting Will Continue Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] After the Zhijiang ferry, operated by the Tongji Shipping Company on the Shanghai route, collided with the Huatong, a barge of the Gongyi Industry Company, at the Wusongkou, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau convened an aftermath meeting at the bureau yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to urge the company to quickly handle the aftermath. Li Guifan, Director of the Maritime Affairs Bureau, Yuan Jin, Port Superintendent of the Customs, Wu Kexiao, Chief of the Water Police Sub-bureau, and the persons in charge of Tongji and Gongyi companies attended the meeting and decided on the following aftermath measures: (1) To urge Tongji Company to register passengers immediately, in addition to refunding ticket prices based on ticket stubs or other evidence, the compensation for the dead, medical treatment for the injured, and compensation for luggage will be paid by Tongji Company before the responsibility for the accident is determined. (2) To entrust the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Bureau to salvage the sunken ship in order to clear the bottom of the cabin and avoid blocking the waterway. If corpses are found, the Water Police Sub-bureau will handle the examination of the corpses. Luggage and goods will be temporarily kept by the Customs for collection. (3) To convene another meeting by the Maritime Affairs Bureau on the 21st to determine the responsibility for the accident, and to determine where the fault lies. At that time, the owners of the Zhijiang and Huatong barges will be present to report on the incident. (The Zhijiang ferry has been under the custody of the Port Police Station after the accident, and was released on bail yesterday. The owner of the Huatong barge has been sent to the District Attorney's Office.)</p>
<p>Director of the Maritime Affairs Bureau Speaks</p>
<p>Director Li of the Maritime Affairs Bureau told reporters after the meeting that the Maritime Affairs Bureau has regulations on the fixed number of passengers for each ship leaving the port. The fixed number for the Zhijiang ferry is 357 people, but the company has sold more tickets or the crew has smuggled yellow croaker. Because the bureau only has more than 60 staff members, it is difficult to take care of all the details. In the future, the Customs and Water Police Bureau will be asked to pay more attention. Ships with more passengers than the fixed number will not be allowed to leave the port. In addition, in order to plan for damage control, wooden boats traveling to other ports will be re-examined, and those that are too old will be prohibited from sailing. Motor sailboats will be banned altogether.</p>
<p>Tongji Issues Statement</p>
<p>[Another News] Personnel from the Customs Port Affairs Bureau, together with more than 100 people from the Water Police and Navy, began salvage work yesterday afternoon at the site where the Zhijiang ferry sank. The number of casualties in this tragedy is still uncertain. The company is strongly denying rumors that there were more than 1,000 passengers on board. Wu Guoqing, Deputy Manager of Tongji Company, also entertained the press yesterday afternoon and issued a written statement, stating: "All passengers have generally been rescued. Seven injured people were sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. Among them, Cai Zhilin died due to serious injuries, Zhou Haigen was seriously injured, and the rest were slightly injured. The company's tickets are entrusted to the Global Bank at 131 Hankou Road, Shanghai, for sale. According to the ticket stubs submitted by the bank, a total of 378 tickets were sold (Nos. 1001-1378)," and so on.</p>
<h3>Xu Jianong, Who Rampaged in Northern Jiangsu and Killed the Township Chief, Sentenced to Fifteen Years in Prison</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Xu Jianong, the chairman of the Communist Army Peasants' Congress in Taixian County, Northern Jiangsu, on April 10 last year, because Yuan Chengxu, the township chief of the 10th district of the county, was slightly hesitant about the "land distribution" method forcibly implemented by the Communist Army and did not immediately comply, Xu tortured him with illegal means, and then ordered his subordinate Teng Zhigan to shoot and kill Yuan. Later, Xu came to Shanghai and happened to be seen by Yuan's nephew, Yuan Yanchang, who reported him to the police and had him arrested and sent to the District Court. After trial, the sentence was pronounced yesterday, with the main text stating: "Xu Jianong is sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for murder, deprived of civil rights for 10 years, and the rest of the charges are dismissed." The other murderer, Teng Zhigan, has been detained and interrogated by the Taixian County District Court, so it is not accepted.</p>
<h3>Outdated Movie Star Xia Peizhen Can Hope to Go Home for the New Year, Commenced to Pardons of Convicted Criminals, More Than 300 Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>Busy Judges Do Not Rest Slightly Due to the Holiday</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Since receiving the amnesty order, the judicial organs of this city have been carrying out the release work. The release of unconvicted prisoners has come to an end in recent days. Yesterday, the release of convicted prisoners who meet the requirements of the amnesty regulations began. A total of 281 prisoners (including one White Russian) in Shanghai Prison were released for convicted simple cases with sentences of 15 years or less. A total of 36 prisoners (including two White Russians, Shavchinsky and Vitetsky) were released from the Sinan Road District Court Detention Center who had been convicted but had not yet been sent to prison. A total of 317 people. Releases will continue today, and work will continue as usual during the Lunar New Year. According to reports, female prisoners who meet the amnesty regulations will be released starting today. Xia Peiren, an outdated movie star who was sentenced to imprisonment for drug use, will also be released today on New Year's Eve and return home for the New Year.</p>
<p>Regarding the reduction of sentences, because this city has not yet received detailed measures, it will need to be handled after receiving the order. Release</p>
<h3>Discussing Simplification of Procedures</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The head of the criminal court of the high court and the district court, the prosecutor, and others gathered yesterday afternoon to discuss emergency handling measures for the release of prisoners, and decided to simplify procedures, handle them quickly, and avoid bail as much as possible to reduce abuses. For all (1) cases in which judgments have been finalized, the files and prisoners will be handed over to the District Attorney's Office in accordance with the Amnesty Order. After approval by the Chief Prosecutor, they will be released immediately. (2) For cases where the judgment is not final, they are further divided into (A) cases that have been judged and are now on appeal, and (B) cases that are still under trial. In this case, there are those under the High Court and those under the District Court. In this situation, the defendant's opinion is sought. If the appeal is waived, it will be treated as a final judgment. If the appeal is not waived, it will depend on the seriousness of the circumstances. Those that are light will be released immediately, and those that are serious must be released on bail.</p>
<p>According to attendees who told reporters: Now that the government has issued the amnesty order, the prisoners held in this city who meet the requirements of the amnesty should be released quickly. However, in fact, it is impossible to release thousands of people in the one or two days before this abolished lunar year. The procedure is really not possible. Because it takes quite a while to review. And some cases involve many defendants, some involve other cases, some have attached civil suits, some require exemption from punishment, and some require reduced sentences, so it is more difficult to judge, and therefore there may be a delay of one or two days. I hope that the family members of the prisoners outside will not be deceived by others, and will not engage in soliciting, etc.</p>
<h3>Single Clothes Seemingly Washed, Warden Gives Money</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning, four prosecutors from the District Court, Yang Shoucheng, Liu Yongzhi, Cao Hong, and Liang Gengsheng, went to Shanghai Prison to handle the release of convicted simple cases. Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang also rushed to supervise at around 10:00 AM. In the afternoon, two more prosecutors, Gong Daping and Gan Chong, went to the prison. After reviewing the roster created by the prison, they opened release tickets on the spot in the prison with the secretary. Ten prisoners were questioned each batch about their age and origin, and then handed over to Bai Qilin, the warden of Shanghai Prison, and Feng Dengyun, the head of the general affairs section, to verify that their identities were correct, press their fingerprints, and then released in batches. Those who were released had all removed their prison uniforms and put on the civilian clothes they had brought in. Among them, several people were thinly dressed and shivering in the cold wind. Section Chief Feng immediately distributed cotton clothes donated by the Post-War Relief Administration for warmth. Among them, there was a prisoner surnamed Pan, who wanted to return to his old home in Qidian after his release, but he had no money, so Warden Bai helped him with 4,000 yuan. Pan thanked him with tears in his eyes. At the time of the release, the prosecutors and prison guards all exhorted them kindly. Most of the released prisoners expressed remorse and vowed not to forget the great kindness of the government's amnesty this time. A total of 281 prisoners in convicted simple cases were released from 11:00 AM to 8:45 PM. All of them had committed crimes such as theft, fraud, intimidation, obscenity, and homicide, and were sentenced to less than 15 years in prison.</p>

<h3>New Year's Eve Scenes: Frenzy at Silver Shops, Atomic Bomb Lanterns Hit the Market</h3>
<p>The silver shops have been a hive of frenzied activity for days, with common laborers and matrons alike flocking to them in a state of "infatuation."</p>
<p>By the Nine-Bend Bridge, a pool of fetid water stagnates, tourists are few, and vendors are languishing – a symbol of hardship, perhaps?</p>
<p>The most striking impression from a visit to the City God Temple is the prominent sign above the main hall: "Beware of Pickpockets." Patrolmen are constantly on the move, guns in hand, creating an atmosphere of grim vigilance.</p>
<p>According to the temple receptionist, "If you want to offer incense, come early on the first day."</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, in the chilling rain, an abandoned infant was found right next to the Lido Dance Hall, starkly illustrating a tragedy of human life.</p>
<p>In this city's public utilities, year-end bonuses are also being awarded to foreign employees – while not unprecedented, it is certainly rare.</p>
<p>According to "well-informed," "reliable," and "authoritative" sources – "qualified," "high-ranking," and "leading" figures – the "outlook" for the market after the New Year is seen as neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic. Thus, the so-called "outlook" seems both right and wrong, and yet neither.</p>
<p>Candle shops around Hongmiao are well-stocked, and there are no restrictions on the supply of ghost money. A single 250 yuan gold certificate can be exchanged for a considerable quantity of ghost money.</p>
<p>Customers throng the large companies to buy New Year's goods, but unfortunately, all the apprentices have been sent away to get their year-end bonuses.</p>
<p>Silk and cloth shops closed early, sealed their windows, mopped the floors, and pulled down the iron gates. The shop assistants had their heads shaved and went out to play, while the old shop manager stayed behind, listlessly playing a gambling game at the counter.</p>
<p>South goods stores were not as crowded as in previous years, but the small vegetable markets were overwhelmed with activity, selling fish, meat, and chicken. Prices changed by the day, and each stall had its own market.</p>
<p>Lanterns are everywhere on Sixth Avenue: lotus lanterns, rabbit lanterns, revolving lanterns... Lantern makers are keeping up with the times, even crafting atomic bomb lanterns. Ignorant children clamor to buy them, oblivious to whether their parents can afford the "New Year's Eve" feast. At dawn, roosters near and far crow in chorus. The streets are littered with firecracker debris. This is "New Year," the "New Year" that everyone looks forward to, the "New Year" that everyone worries about.</p>
<h3>Spring Festival - Many Government Agencies Take Holidays</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] From tomorrow, spring will arrive and everything will be fresh. The civilian and military agencies usually have a day off, like the various bureaus of the City Government and the various agencies of the Army, Navy and Air Force. However, the police are an exception because of security. As for public transport, it will continue to run as usual to maintain traffic.</p>
<p>Also, today the financial industry, banks and money shops, will extend business hours by two hours to facilitate the collection and settlement of funds from all industries. The Shanghai Clearing House will also extend the clearing time by two hours and will close at 4 pm.</p>
<h3>Doctor Deeply in Love - Ashamed of Lover, Seeks Death - Shen Yaoxian Shoots Himself, Seriously Wounded and in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Dr. Shen Yaoxian, 41 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at 19 Wuding Lane, Wuding Road, was visiting his relative Ms. Zhong Yongfang (19 years old) in Ward 7, 3rd floor of Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital at the intersection of Huangpi South Road and Ninghai West Road at 10:45 last night, when he suddenly took advantage of the lack of preparation and shot himself with his self-defense pistol, the bullet entering his left chest. He immediately fell to the ground. The hospital then reported the case to the police, who came to the hospital to investigate. After investigation, it was found that the incident was due to Zhong falling in love with Shen last fall. Because of the vast age difference, she felt deep regret. At the same time, people were afraid of gossip, so the idea of ​​disgust with the world arose spontaneously, and she attempted suicide the night before at her residence at 50 Wenhua Villa, Shanyin Road, and was seriously injured after jumping from the building.

<h3>Miss Luzon - Rescued British Boy - Full of Sadness - Stamp Collection All Washed Away</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the "Miss Luzon" accident near Manila, many tragedies and comedies occurred. Among them, three British boys were also frightened, but they finally survived the ordeal. One of the three children, Li Que, Spackens, was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Manila yesterday morning. His parents went to the airport to meet him, but learned that the plane had returned to Manila due to mechanical damage and would not arrive until this afternoon.</p>
<p>Li Que is twelve years old this year. His father works for the Shanghai Gas Company. This time, he planned to study in the UK and left Shanghai alone with two young friends by plane. The reporter met his parents yesterday. According to them, Li Que and his two friends were very calm after the plane crash. After being rescued to the rubber dinghy, Li Que found that the water in the dinghy was gradually rising. He hurriedly took off a sock and used the sock to scoop the water out of the dinghy, and as a result, he was safe. But the thing he felt most sad about was that the 2,000 old stamps he had collected for several years were swept away by the waves.</p>
<h3>Starting Point for Banquet Donations - Tea is Not a Dish - No Tax Should Be Collected - Wine and Food Industry Association Requests Reconsideration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Wine and Food Industry Commercial Association believes that the tax rate for banquet taxes decided at the second meeting of the City Council does not conform to the actual situation, and has specially requested a review. The reasons are: (1) The banquet tax rate stipulates that a flat rate of 15% should be levied above the tax threshold, which is inconsistent with the revised tax law. Please reduce it to a flat rate of 10%. (2) The tax threshold is set at 5,000 yuan, and regardless of how many people eat together, 5,000 yuan is used as the starting point, which is not consistent with the price situation in this city. Please relax the scale and calculate it per person. (3) Tea is not a dish, and using tea for guests at festive banquets is to promote frugality, so banquet tax should not be levied.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Stipulates Optional Subjects for Normal School Group D Enhancing Hygiene Knowledge for National Teachers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of Education believes that the general public in our country lacks hygiene knowledge, resulting in a very high mortality rate. From now on, national teachers, as nannies for children and mentors for the public, should take the responsibility of promoting hygiene education. It has specially stipulated optional subjects for Group D of Normal Schools and ordered all schools to implement them uniformly. The optional subjects for Group D are hygiene education and common medical knowledge. The former will be taught from the second academic year, and the latter will be taught from the third academic year, both for two hours each week.</p>

<h3>My Wife, Helen</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xueshan</p>
<p>The number of divorces proves that marriage is extremely difficult to maintain love. Many marriages are only maintained reluctantly like shackles. Thank you to my wife, she saved me from this terrible fate!</p>
<p>Helen is optimistic. I have been married to her for ten years, but I have never seen her grumpy, sad, or indifferent face when I come home every day.</p>
<p>If I am mentally depressed, her warmth will cheer me up. If she has any difficulties in her own life, she will face them bravely and cheerfully. I have seen her give birth three times and undergo two operations, but her actions make people feel that I am the one suffering, and she is saving me.</p>
<p>Helen is loyal. I am her person, and her loyalty to me is even greater than my loyalty to myself. She is my "fan", my agent. No matter how many mistakes or failures I have, her belief in my abilities has always been strong.</p>
<p>She knows that our three children are the most promising teenagers in the world. She carefully records every bit of their health, skills, and love. She treats them very strictly, with the aim of promoting their sense of superiority. They can respect themselves even more because of her strictness. Helen is very wasteful, but not with money, but with herself. Her personality does not allow her to do something and stop halfway. When she solves a difficult problem, she always says proudly, "This thing must be done right."</p>
<p>Helen is not picky. She doesn't bother me with the question, "Why didn't you do that?" She never tries to manipulate my career, control my entertainment, choose my friends, or order me to do all the other chores.</p>
<p>She doesn't pry into secrets or ask questions. If I am not interested, she will not force me to speak. She can wait. I don't have to give a report every day like other husbands about when and with whom and for what reason I went where. Helen is the best at listening, but the worst at asking. She doesn't open my letters, and she doesn't search my luggage. I don't even have to worry about money. It's not because I have abundant financial resources, it's because we don't have to be petty with each other. I give her some money every week, and I keep some for myself. She pays the household expenses, and the excess money is spent appropriately. I pay insurance, taxes, and medical expenses, etc., and I am free to save or spend the rest.</p>
<p>Helen is not perfect. She has her quirks, and although some of them seem annoying, I don't want to change them because they are the essence of her personality. One of her weaknesses is that she speaks too generally; if it rained for three days in September, she would say "it rained all month". She is not afraid to organize closets, suitcases, and drawers; in fact, they are always messy.</p>
<p>Helen is interesting because she is interested in herself. Life makes her happy and makes her sad, and she moves forward with excitement. There seems to be a kind of surprise and laughter boiling in her all the time. Even when she is not speaking, you can see her soul criticizing herself. She listens to the most ordinary stories with the same energy as someone describing the attack on Pearl Harbor. Because she is interested in the things happening around her, she cannot be too interested in herself. Many women have a strong sense of self-awareness, and always comb their hair, tidy their clothes, look in the mirror, apply rouge, etc. in front of people, but she never has this kind of anxiety. Life, laughter, pain, vision, memory, discovery, creation, love—all these dramas move her. For her, marriage is not boring; to do it well, one must put in effort, "but this thing must be done right!"</p>
<p>Although she does not work hard at marriage, she does not dream of seizing her partner and children entirely for herself like other women. I am not her prisoner, and she is not my jailer.</p>
<p>Then what is the ending?</p>
<p>The ending is strange and sweet; Helen does not restrict my freedom or change my personality, but she has indeed gained my slave-like loyalty for herself.</p>

<h3>Men's Vanity</h3>
<p>— Wei Shan</p>
<p>Men often like to talk about women's vanity to set off their own brilliance.</p>
<p>I admit that women are vain, but at least they are open about it. For example, I like to read articles about beauty in newspapers and I don't hide it, but men's vanity is different.</p>
<p>If you want to see a man's vanity, it is best to hide where he cannot see you when he is dressed up and ready to go to a party. He will slowly walk to the mirror, and his hand will gently touch his shiny hair, which is full of oil, then he will straighten his bow tie, pretend to dust off the dust on his coat, stick out his shoulders, and finally walk out triumphantly.</p>
<p>We often hear that women's decorations are to attract men. This is not correct. Men's decorations are indeed to attract women. Women love beauty entirely out of normality. They decorate, whether the people they interact with are male or female, they are all the same.</p>
<p>If a woman is washed up on a desert island, her suitcase will still contain various makeup tools and cosmetics. Do you think she would be disheveled all day long just because there are no men on the island? But purely male group life is mostly disheveled.</p>
<p>Most men like their wives to wear eye-catching clothes, and many men encourage their wives to wear luxurious and fashionable clothes.</p>
<p>I once heard a friend say: "I love my wife to wear fashionable clothes. If she wears shabby clothes, it will lower my status."</p>
<p>This sentence probably represents the vanity of men.</p>
<h3>Talking About Soy Sauce</h3>
<p>— Shunding</p>
<p>Opening the door to seven things: firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea. Soy sauce is also a major item in the seven things, and soy sauce is not only a condiment, but also made from soybeans and wheat flour through a long period of fermentation with water and salt. Therefore, soy sauce, in addition to water, also contains very rich protein. Protein is the highest class of nutrients and is the element for the body to make blood and muscles. Foods that contain a large amount of protein and are easily digested and absorbed are nourishing foods. The protein contained in soy sauce is not only abundant but also easily digested. The umami taste of soy sauce comes entirely from protein. The fresher the taste, the more protein it contains. In addition, soy sauce also contains vitamins B and D, calcium, phosphorus, and other substances, which are important nutrients that the human body cannot lack. According to recent research by experts, soy sauce also has several important properties in treatment. Singers who occasionally have hoarse throats can drink a cup of soy sauce soup. If they can drink a cup of hot soy sauce soup every morning, over time, their voice will become bright and clear. Also, when traveling or camping in snowy weather, if you drink a cup of warm soy sauce in advance, it can not only resist the cold and increase body temperature but also strengthen the heart's beating ability. Or pregnant women whose fetal qi is rushing upwards and vomiting, drinking soy sauce can also treat them. In addition, soy sauce can also detoxify opium and arsenic. However, now because the raw materials for making soy sauce are expensive, unscrupulous merchants make fake goods to gain huge profits. According to reports last year, several soy sauce companies in the city had their soy sauce found by the health authorities to be made entirely of water, salt, and coloring agents. If we buy this kind of soy sauce, can eating it be beneficial? Therefore, we should still go to a larger and more reputable sauce garden to buy soy sauce, which is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Finally, I will write down the most common and easy-to-do methods for selecting soy sauce below for reference: First, if you try top-quality soy sauce on the tip of your tongue, you will immediately feel that its taste is slightly sweet, salty, and pure. Inferior ones taste sour and bitter, and the salty taste is strong and not pure. Second, take soy sauce and drop it into a colorless glass bottle, and shine it in the sunlight. The red color and extremely beautiful luster will be found. Also, those that turn reddish-brown in white porcelain are good products; as for those with yellowish-brown or cyan-black color and impure luster, they are inferior products. Third, if a small amount of soy sauce is placed in a colorless glass bottle, and the mouth of the bottle is plugged and inverted, and the soy sauce at the bottom is illuminated by sunlight, the longer the trace of soy sauce remains, the thicker it is. If the time is short, it is a thin product. Fourth, put a small amount of soy sauce in white porcelain and stir it with chopsticks, and the foam color is light yellow, which is a top-quality product. As for the foam that is light red or white, it is an inferior product. Fifth, if a top-quality soy sauce is boiled and placed in a white glass bottle, the protein contained in it will coagulate and appear like mist or thread. Inferior products will show a mixture of impurities that precipitate. Sixth, for pure soy sauce without a mixture of impurities, its specific gravity to water should be 1.19120 to 1.19125.</p>
<h3>New Year, Be Careful with Your Children!</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>The Gregorian New Year has just passed, and the Lunar New Year is coming again. The joy that children experience during the New Year far surpasses that of adults; I believe everyone has gone through such a phase! Therefore, at the start of the New Year, parents should be especially careful with their children.</p>
<p>Be careful with what your children eat: During the New Year, children eat particularly a lot. One moment it's snacks, the next it's candy. They truly never stop eating from morning till night. As parents, you should know that children have limited appetites. As the saying goes, "Illness enters through the mouth." Overeating can cause indigestion and bloating. Children's digestive systems are weak. If you're not careful about what they eat, celebrating the New Year might instead create illness. Joy turns into worry. It's best to prevent problems before they arise, and moderation in eating is ideal.</p>
<p>Be careful with how your children spend money: At the start of the New Year, children usually receive lucky money. However, children don't know how to use money wisely. They often buy meaningless toys, such as firecrackers. Even older children still gamble. This must be strictly avoided because learning to gamble from a young age leaves a deep impression. When they grow up, they'll only escalate their gambling, causing endless harm. It's best if children obtain parental permission or guidance before buying toys and snacks. The best approach is to collect the lucky money children receive and save it for appropriate expenses. Half can be used to buy candies and toys for the children, or to watch movies, and the other half can be used for tuition, savings, or charity. This is a proper way to spend money, harmless and beneficial.</p>
<p>Be careful with what your children play: During the New Year, children are not attending school, and staying at home is like letting loose a wild horse. They play wantonly, which is also highly inappropriate. Children often get lost or run away during the New Year, or get into accidents by running on the streets. As parents, you should always pay attention.</p>
<p>As parents, who doesn't cherish their children? Taking advantage of this New Year, it is vital to be extra careful with your children!</p>
<h3>British Women's Employment Statistics</h3>
<p>— Jia Ling</p>

<h3>A Photo of Yu Dafu</h3>
<p>— GM</p>
<p>Recently, I have often talked about Mr. Yu Dafu with friends. His kind of idealistic art is something many writers cannot learn. We are still inevitably shrouded in the ideology of heroism, not worshipping the ordinary, believing that art, as such, is less useful in the material world than boilers and motors. If it cannot win over others with unique methods or broad spirit, or bring comfort to people, or give people good enlightenment, then the diligent pursuer will gradually lose his original intention. Dafu has had heroic acts; in simple paper art, he compared himself to George Moore, and in attitude, he did not fail to be a Chateaubriand. His style defined a school in Chinese literature.</p>
<p>We are most afraid of looking at Dafu with a moral consciousness, because he originally wanted to stand against this concept to create that kind of art. He was a trendsetter produced by the May Fourth Movement.</p>
<p>Dafu had many crowds who loved him. These people chased him, just as the poet Zhimo said, "Dafu is very lovable," for no other reason. His idealistic lyrical writing, melancholy temperament, and general unconstrained attitude indeed easily overcame those who had strong self-consciousness with a calculating mind.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth year of the Republic, when I first visited his residence in Shichahai, Beijing, I had a fantasy that he must be someone with the appearance and demeanor of Hugo and Shelley, and I was somewhat hesitant to move forward. When I met him, I felt that he was very much like the boss of a housekeeper, if not for wearing that semi-old coffee-colored robe. It is said that he lectured on economics at Peking University, but soon he went south because of other jobs. We often heard news of him in Shanghai, his whereabouts, before he went to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>After returning from Guangzhou, he wrote many texts. The Chicken Rib Collection and Nine Kinds of Diaries were all printed during those one or two years. His complete works also gradually appeared in various bookstores, "Luoyang was made more expensive by its paper," this is indeed not an excessive description. From the Nine Kinds of Diaries, we know his new family organization. We were all happy to read this book of his, thinking that he had a poet's attitude. In those one or two years, he collected many old Western books, "encompassing everything." He said that they were dragged home by a car. He did not prepare to run to the mountains of Fuyang, which also made us feel his brightness.</p>
<p>In the twenty-third year, he lived quietly in Hangzhou, in a small happy family, with two or three children already. He did not easily go out to get drunk anymore, frankly and openly. Sometimes, on the Su Causeway of West Lake, he could be found walking slowly with his hands behind his back, talking侃侃, followed by several young people wearing Western clothes or carrying Western clothes on their shoulders.</p>
<p>Several times, I went to visit him with Jingwen. "I don't write anything anymore," he said without waiting for anyone to ask, "I have collected many books, and I am going to estimate the good price in the future." We walked into his书房, and we really sighed that even Zuo Si was not as good. Some of the versions he collected cheaply were indeed precious. Such as the English translation of DeCameron (Boccaccio), first edition—at that time, Dr. Samuel Johnson had not yet died.</p>
<p>He taught literary criticism for a few hours at Zhijiang University. Coincidentally, his collection of books was lacking in this area, so he made two trips to Shanghai to search extensively, only finding one book by Saint Beuve, in French, and one book by Lewison, which was very popular and had already been translated by Mr. Fu ××. I borrowed a book from a friend, Winchester's Principles of Criticism, but it was too common, and many people said they had read it; G. Brandes of Denmark could not figure out the clues; there were too many of Saints-berry of England, and Belinski of Russia could not be bought at all. He said: "Buying them all is also a bad business."</p>
<p>Dafu served his mother very filially, and often returned to Fuyang to visit her. His mother was very frail and frugal, almost too much so, and rarely came to see West Lake even once in ten years. In the early summer of the twenty-third year, Dafu took her to his residence and visited West Lake for a day. She did not seem to feel anything and hurriedly went back.</p>
<p>In the summer of the twenty-third year, some people said it was the first time in their lives that it was so hot. Dafu lived in seclusion, and we sometimes went to visit him. We often encountered him teasing the children while writing. Sometimes, when he heard a knock on the door, he would first have someone peek through the mailbox slit. Perhaps it was a tired guest, or perhaps he was afraid of being intimidated. In those few years, he was simply a little afraid of something. West Lake cracked, and the scenery was not easy to appreciate.</p>
<p>After that, I never saw Dafu again. In the twenty-eighth year, Mr. Ke Ling, a friend in Shanghai, was the editor of the supplement of the Dami Newspaper. He had an appointment and wrote in a letter saying: Dafu had been in Singapore for only a few months, and he received the Asian Literature he sent from Singapore, which also contained a creative little × son serving as a soldier. He began to feel that Dafu still loved himself, his homeland. He ran so far to avoid the hustle and bustle, to seek bread for his young children, not out of cowardice. At that time, some people still passed on his news from time to time, until after the fall of Singapore.</p>

<h3>Snow</h3>
<p>— Zhong Baihua</p>
<p>Snow has finally fallen.</p>
<p>This pure white and subtle crystalline substance, even shorter than the ephemeral epiphyllum, is loved by everyone. From childhood impressions, to the wandering in mournful middle age, even in old age, seeing it will make their "eyes light up". Of course, I am the same. Every time I am in front of snow, I will simulate Su Dongpo's "Light Yao silver sea dazzles flowers" and Zhang Yuanhao's "Fighting back three million jade dragons, defeated scales and broken fields fly all over the sky", those poetic meanings. However, every time I face it, I never evoke any "烟司披里纯", I don't know why, I only simulate and fantasize, I don't know if it is so beautiful that it is difficult to describe, or if a cold power hidden behind the subtlety silences me. However, I, like everyone else, love it.</p>
<p>Today's snow makes us love it even more, because a year has passed. The snow, like a late arrival, is still the first time it has deigned to come. How people who have been waiting anxiously will cheer: "Snow, has finally fallen!"</p>
<p>I love it, put on my raincoat and go out, feeling very relaxed in the subtlety. Unlike rainy days, the heavy raindrops attack uncomfortably. At this time, what unfolds before my eyes is a piece of white, a beautiful white. I can't think of a better sentence to praise it, except for thinking of Yang Fu's Snow Eulogy: "Using purity to transform, riding the air to flutter, encountering images can be fresh, instantly becoming a clean brilliance." Yes, all I have is fantasy, like its own ephemeral illusion. In fact, the predecessors were smarter than us. The so-called "God's Jade Play" has pointed out its illusion, and the sentence "also knowing that it will not make solid jade" further explains that it cannot be regarded as jade after all. Why are there now many poor scholars confined to cold eaves who can fill their stomachs or be dispatched to the market?</p>
<p>The sorrow of fantasy!</p>
<p>But subtle snow is still better than heavy rain. Although its quality is so light and weak, the ability of the sky to act in unison can temporarily allow a piece of white to cover up the black holes of the earth. Especially today's snow, flying over everything, the ground, the roof tiles, the trees, truly "instantly becoming a clean brilliance", also because it is not abused, it stops after a few hours, just in time to clear the stuffy and muddy roads of the whole morning rain.</p>
<p>Of course, the temperature suddenly dropped because of it. Alas, - the snow is fluttering and the guests have warm robes! (After the snow on January 8th)</p>
<h3>Sleeping Beauty (Partial)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Erqiao</p>
<p>Giorgione (1477-1510) was the most outstanding disciple of Bellini of the Venetian school. He had no opportunity to receive education since he was a child, and everything was achieved through his own efforts. After studying under Bellini, his talent was extraordinary, and he eventually became a great master of the time. His works mostly depict figures. Representative works include "Pastoral Concert" and "Sleeping Beauty". The style is rich in ideals and contains an atmosphere of music and poetry. This picture is very long, this is a part of it. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Poems from the Cangshan Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tixuan</p>
<p>Small Room</p>
<p>In this small room, I dream of mountain passes and rivers, but wake up to a sudden storm. I don't hear the cry of a wild rooster; I suspect there are dragons hiding. I put on my clothes and walk into the courtyard, my autumn shadow lean in the lamplight. Grand thoughts gallop to the eight corners of the earth, and I pity the starving and drowning millions. Even now, on the coast of the East Sea, the remnants of the brigands are still arrogant. I long to join Li Guo, and sadly imagine Yan Zhao. I sit and wait for the river and sky to clear, and the heavy darkness will open up the woods.</p>
<p>Travel Notes from the Suburbs of Chongqing</p>
<p>Passing Tiger Rock, I ride quickly to Xiaolongkan. The morning wind drums up the angry wheels, as fast as a ball rolling down a slope. The car compartment is filled with clamor; the worry is that it is too full of people. Standing side by side like stringed fish, being in it feels like being crushed. Walking on level ground is like treading on thorns; the distance is so near, yet I resent its farness. Looking at the flowers on the path from afar, I envy those who return slowly. The Shu Road is high in the blue sky, and the spring plain has short daylight. Alas, it is difficult to travel on this road, which has been said to be rare since ancient times. Who is it that has caused us to come here? The bandits in the country are fierce. When will the reform come? I want to sigh for the insignificance of Weiguan.</p>
<p>Autumn Feelings Following Pengming's Rhymes</p>
<p>The old customs are mixed in the book collection, and your talent is truly unparalleled. The snow table is piled with thousands of lines, and the frost blade is stingy for a test. You sent me an autumn cloud poem, falling with deep meaning. Everyone is drunk in a daze, and scholars are frustrated. The dragon is trapped in the mud, who will spread its influence? I am ashamed that I cannot help you, and I also violate my will. I look in the mirror and sigh, already past thirty-four. I always cherish the hungry and drowning heart, watching the sky and tears are hard to control. The sycamore leaves fall in the high autumn, and the phoenix bird arrives. There will be a day for clarification, and I dare to swear to the Great River.</p>
<p>Flower Morning Gathering and Selling Calligraphy</p>
<p>The spring shade brews a slight chill, and suddenly the Flower Morning arrives again. The club gathers at Xiaoxiang (wine shop name), chanting in high spirits is really pleasant. I happen to be nursing my illness at this time, not to avoid poetry debts. One thought is tied to red and purple, and I bow a green chapter to the sky. May the hundred flowers bloom in the future, and do not let the wind and rain defeat them. I hope to fill this heart, and hold it as a precept for governing the people. Nourishing the people is like nourishing flowers, and the demands are too harmful. Protecting flowers is like protecting the people, and removing the superior is not allowed to be loaned. The spring breeze fans the warm harmony, and all the flowers are happy to rely on it. The south acre should be in time, and the oxen should be bought with a sword to be sold.</p>
<h3>Abolishing the New Year and Abolishing Words</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been established for thirty-six years, and the Gregorian calendar has been used as the national calendar for thirty-six years, but the folk society still has a considerable, temporary, and difficult to eradicate universal potential force for the habits of the old meals. Even if you use the power of ten thousand jun, there is no way to eliminate it. Habit can be said to be extremely stubborn.</p>
<p>"The sound of firecrackers removes the old, and peach charms are renewed by thousands of households." The judgment of the division between the New Year and the year of the abandoned calendar lies in these few firecrackers to mark the era. Although people post couplets two or three days early, before the time comes, everyone will not set off firecrackers, and it is still the remaining year.</p>
<p>Although the Spring Festival couplets of "National Grace and Family Celebration, Longevity and Abundant Years" contain a bit of feudalistic color, it shows the scene of "Ascending Peace Century". What people hope for, in terms of the country, is that the sea and the universe will be peaceful; in the family, it is Anqing and happiness. Personally, it is health and longevity, not illness and premature death. The farmers naturally seek a good harvest with favorable weather; such a scene is undoubtedly the common desire in the hearts of the masses. But what is it like now, think about it, I think about it! Why did it come to this point?</p>
<p>"A year's plan lies in spring, and a day's plan lies in the morning." Our welcoming of the New Year has a profound meaning. The cold and solemn winter is about to collapse; the spring breeze is kind and gentle, and everything is revived, which means the germination of the new opportunity for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the individual hopes for it in the same way!</p>
<p>I have said that the abandoned calendar year has a stubborn, widespread, and potential force in society. No matter how much you don't have a relationship with it, the surrounding air attacks can't help but have a little influence on you, which is an undeniable fact. At the same time, it can also prove that a traditional habit (whether good or bad) has its own objective conditions for existence. The abandoned calendar year has been sentenced to death for thirty-six years, but it still stubbornly occupies and exists. From this point of view, we know that the reform of an old habit is gradual, not rapid. At the same time, we know that it takes great determination and effort to eliminate (reform) an old habit. In Chinese society, especially among the vast number of farmers, the abandoned calendar is just a period of rest, not a superstitious act.</p>
<p>Some people say that the biggest harvest of the Xinhai Revolution was the universal cutting of braids by men, and most of the others failed. This sentence can be said to be quite reasonable.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to some industrial, commercial, agricultural, and monks, there are also some calligraphers, painters, and poets who use the abandoned calendar to record the year. Some of them are the ruling authorities. All official documents use the national calendar, and even name and write to prohibit the use of the abandoned calendar, but in his calligraphy, painting, poetry, and lyrics, some still write using the lunar calendar to record the year. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Only a few people, such as Ye Gongchuo and Liu Yazi, write 件 and use the Republic of China to record the year. In addition to using the national calendar, Liu also uses the Gregorian calendar more often, which is of the times.</p>
<p>Newspapers in Hong Kong and Macau. Some of them have the lunar calendar listed in addition to the national calendar, and the old and new are the same, which is said to be convenient for the local citizens. For example, "January 22, 36th year of the Republic of China", and another page is printed with "the first day of the first lunar month in the year of Ding Hai", which makes some people have another impression when they read it.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it is mostly a malformation to talk about all reforms when politics is not on the right track, and it is not something that can be achieved overnight. Talking about abolishing the calendar and the New Year in the late winter and early spring seems to have a bit of attention to the suspicion of the abandoned calendar. In this weird season, let's talk about the year of the abolished calendar, let's just talk nonsense.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 156</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Do you know their purpose tonight? It's funny that they treated me as stupid as Cao Cao in the Three Kingdoms period; even Cao Cao knew to assume seventy-two suspicious tombs, but his real tomb was outside the seventy-two tombs... Judo and kendo we cannot abandon, that is the traditional foundation of the founding of Japan, but like they use it again and again, as a tool to attack people's spirits, ha, that is abused... Your swordsmanship is not bad, but unfortunately I can't keep you by my side, the things on the mainland are more important..."</p>
<p>Tsurumi came out of Konoe's place. The "08" wild boar and the car were still waiting outside Beppu.</p>
<p>"How is it?" Tsurumi asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Failed!" The wild boar replied listlessly.</p>
<p>"What exactly happened?" Tsurumi was eager to understand everything that had happened.</p>
<p>"Ansaka received an emergency warning around nine o'clock, advising us to stop the action; it was sent by Pingzi. But we still proceeded; at the intersection of Thirty-six Town, Yuanzi's small line ran over and also stopped us from proceeding, saying that all the arrangements had changed. This, we encountered great difficulties. For the sake of caution, Ansaka ordered a general retreat, otherwise, all future arrangements would be destroyed...</p>
<p>"When we were about to disperse the personnel at the corner of Thirty Town, we suddenly found ourselves surrounded. Pingzi came out and told us that everything did not violate our plan, as long as we had the courage to cooperate with them. He also told us that except for the technical personnel, no other strength was needed. We agreed to the conditions, and only three people joined their group; Ansaka left three or four ambush lines, prepared to give you a warning, and later found the secret post of the Fifth Column, so he immediately canceled the ambush lines; the most important reason was still due to Pingzi's guarantee that you were in no danger..."</p>
<p>"Our three people three, seven, eleven, followed their group,绕大圈子, crossed from the 'Kuto' abandoned garden to the Xiongben Temple, and from the Xiongben Temple they attacked Beppu; our Yuanzi and several of their internal lines connected the three technical personnel and explored the basement without encountering much difficulty. The goods were also found; when they opened the envelope, there were only a few blank sheets of paper. Ansaka suspected that chemical ink was used on the paper, but Ueno said it was absolutely impossible, because it was an international document and could not use invisible ink. When they turned around to come out, they found a note hanging behind the exit hatch, 'Wasted effort'..."</p>
<p>At half past ten the next morning, Tsurumi arrived at the military airport again. In advance, the General Staff Headquarters received Konoe's hand note, "Tsurumi Tamaki was promoted to the actual rank of colonel, assistant of the special operations section of the General Staff Headquarters of the mainland, and director of the telecommunications section." The former full-time position is now changed to a part-time position, I am afraid that the second step is to cancel the part-time position. Because of the emergency order from the headquarters, Tsurumi once again boarded the plane to cross the west.</p>
<p>As soon as he stepped into the plane, Tsurumi noticed at a glance two delicate and beautiful young women, quietly occupying one seat each; one of them nodded and smiled at Tsurumi, but at the same time gave Tsurumi a hint, telling him not to talk. That was of course Pingzi again. As soon as Tsurumi saw Pingzi, he immediately felt extremely uneasy, like a芒刺stuck in his back. As soon as he sat down, Pingzi's signal came, she was sitting next to Tsurumi, separated by a narrow aisle, her left hand was on her knee, avoiding the sight of the other woman.</p>
<p>"Big brother, don't pay too much attention to my hand!" Pingzi tapped out the code with her fingers.</p>
<p>"Who is she?" Tsurumi also put his right hand in a place that the woman on the opposite seat could not see, and asked.</p>
<p>"A Manchurian bitch, she stinks, but she doesn't feel it at all. Big brother, do you think it's funny?"</p>

<h3>Abolish Lucky Money, Change to Sending Children Gifts</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kang</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year is a custom to give money to children, which is called "lucky money". The meaning of "lucky money" is to suppress the "peace" of a child for one year, who knows who is the originator?</p>
<p>But under the modern reform of customs, although we are not very opposed to the meaning of lucky money, we dare not agree with and promote it!</p>
<p>You should know that the "struggles" and "infighting" that occur among human beings in the world are all for "money". Children's knowledge is not yet developed, and rashly opening this effect of money is not very logical with the two words "lucky money"!</p>
<p>Especially in this "New Year", the colorful toys, candies, firecrackers, etc. on the street, once children have money, they buy recklessly behind their parents' backs, some eat unclean or indigestible candies, some buy inferior toys, so that children are indirectly affected by this "lucky money", even eating out of trouble, or causing trouble!</p>
<p>Therefore, the custom of "lucky money" is to love children appropriately enough to harm children, but for the unbreakable customs, most people know that it is harmful and do so every year, we should call out and "abolish" it!</p>
<p>Often a person in society will obliterate reason and forget shame for money, let alone a small-minded child, enlightening them with the concept of "having money to play and eat", this kind of fluke mentality is really undesirable! Because during the New Year period, "gambling" is prevalent in Chinese society, and there are demons everywhere on the streets and alleys that tempt children, so giving children "lucky money" really has "a hundred harms and no benefits"!</p>
<p>I hope that social people will abolish this custom of "lucky money"! Change to sending "children's newspapers" and "intelligent toys" to cultivate noble knowledge, which is exactly for the sake of our next generation and the relationship of the country, society, and the country, we have to "cry out loudly"!</p>
<h3>Who Says the Old Year-End is Hard to Get Through? Joyful Scenes in the Streets and Alleys</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Yangguan (阳关, a place name representing safety) ultimately couldn't defeat Yinguang (阴关, a place name representing hardship).</p>
<p>The streets frequently added a lot of "red" color. Vendors selling "lucky money" envelopes were everywhere. Ten for 1,000 yuan, ten for 500 yuan, they shouted as they walked the streets. This "red" color reflected many people filled with "happiness," and many holding "sorrow!"</p>
<p>Orange vendors lined the streets and alleys, with bright red Fortune Oranges and golden Shantou Mandarin Oranges, each stall displaying the fruit, such beautiful colors, so adorable!</p>
<p>In the City God Temple, the New City God Temple, Wangping Street... one could see carts selling "New Year's offerings." Yellow winter plum blossoms, potted ancient plum blossoms with budding flowers, and red and adorable Nandina domestica plants, one by one. Most of the flower buyers were young mistresses from wealthy families, who specially came by rickshaw, chartered car, or automobile. The flower sellers didn't have a fixed price, it depended on the buyer's "style." This year, a branch of Nandina or winter plum, even the most ordinary, would cost ten to twenty thousand yuan. Poor people don't have this "refined interest," they simply aren't worthy of "pure offerings!"</p>
<p>Children's toys are also "popular" during this time. Balloons, knives and guns, lanterns... colorful and vibrant, which child wouldn't be happy to see them? Especially the "crackling" sounds, strings of firecrackers piercing people's eardrums.</p>
<p>The candy department in companies is the busiest, and the shops selling southern goods are even more crowded. "New Year's Eve" and "New Year's Day" are "the season for eating" and "the days for playing." If we stroll outside, how could we see "poverty"? "New Year cake," "fine wine," "oranges," "chicken," "fish," "meat," bundles and baskets, everywhere is filled with a "busy New Year" scene, everyone has "money," such "extravagance!"</p>
<p>All prices are much higher than ten days ago, the Shanghai people call it "slaughtering on New Year's Eve," but customs are hard to change, so one can only "eat rat poison with their eyes open"!</p>
<p>Not to mention that prices rise with the occasion, even the young rickshaw pullers are making ten times the usual profit, demanding an additional "one-third" compared to usual.</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, the City God Temple and Hong Temple are packed with crowds burning incense to the stars... wisps of incense smoke sting the eyes until they tear up. "Boss, incense candles, please!" If you walk around the City God Temple and Hong Temple, these incense candle sellers who rely on one spring to get through three winters truly have a good time to make money from New Year's Eve to the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>But everything, big or small, male or female, especially those doing small businesses, hopes that the heavens will be kind at the end of the year and the beginning of the New Year. This is the first condition. Only "rain" makes those doing small business "cry out in distress!"</p>

<h3>Filler: Where is "I"?</h3>
<p>— Nai Ren</p>
<p>Where is "I"? How big is it? How tall? What does it look like? I haven't heard its laughter or footsteps, it just follows you, its age is the same as yours, neither old nor young.</p>
<p>Where exactly is "I"? When you are talking to someone, don't you often say "He asked me?" "That thing is mine," and point to the tip of your nose? And you would never point to your eyes or ears, so at this time "I" should be on the tip of the nose.</p>
<p>When quarreling with someone, you often pat your chest, shouting "Damn it, I'm afraid of you!" At this time, "I" should be in the chest, and not in the lower abdomen or thighs.</p>
<p>It is rarely found elsewhere. This "I" that accompanies us throughout our lives, we should discover it, grasp it, seize it, and not let it waste this life without a trace or sound.</p>
<h3>A Murder Case</h3>
<p>— William</p>
<p>This is a murder case that happened in Bagdad.</p>
<p>A careless pedestrian on the sidewalk was tripped by a stone and fell to his death.</p>
<p>The road was crowded with people, and someone went to report to the judge.</p>
<p>The judge was very anxious, because the murderer was unknown.</p>
<p>The judge ordered the bailiff to arrest the owner of the house closest to the stone to be punished.</p>
<p>The homeowner said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! I am innocent! Because that stone was forgotten by the stonemason, he repaired my house yesterday."</p>
<p>The judge then released the homeowner and ordered the stonemason to be arrested and punished.</p>
<p>The stonemason said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! I am wronged! When I was working, suddenly a very beautiful girl walked by, her loveliness, her beautiful hair, her curved body, and her most outstanding blue dress attracted me!... The color of her dress was so moving, I couldn't control myself, I could only forget my work and follow her to see my fill. So the responsibility for forgetting the stone on the sidewalk is not mine but the girl's!"</p>
<p>The judge then declared the stonemason innocent and ordered the girl to be arrested and punished.</p>
<p>The girl said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! I am innocent! Heaven gave me beauty, it is not my fault. As for that blue dress that made the stonemason infatuated, I didn't make it myself, it should be the tailor's responsibility!"</p>
<p>The judge then ordered the tailor to be arrested and punished.</p>
<p>The tailor said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! I just sewed a few pieces of material together with thread, I didn't weave the material, the responsibility should be on the textile worker."</p>
<p>The judge then arrested the weaver to be punished.</p>
<p>The weaver said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! Although I wove the material, you can't blame me for the moving color, the responsibility should be on the dyer."</p>
<p>The judge had no choice but to arrest the dyer to be punished.</p>
<p>The dyer said: "Your Most Honorable Judge! This dye was not invented by me, it was passed down by our generations, and some also come from foreign countries..."</p>
<p>But the judge didn't want to listen anymore, he thought the dyer was guilty, so he ordered him to be hanged.</p>
<p>After a while, the bailiff suddenly came back and said</p>
<p>"Your Most Honorable Sir! Our gallows can't hang him, because he is too tall."</p>
<p>"Release him and find a short man to replace him." The judge said impatiently. (Released from "Crown Magazine")</p>
