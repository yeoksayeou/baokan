<h3>溪口父老依依惜別　主席夫婦飛抵杭州　午後曾赴紹興謁禹王陵</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十一日電〕蔣主席夫婦今午十二時飛抵杭州。其第一批侍從人負於晨八時三刻即飛抵筧橋。今晨十時主席夫婦行前，先在蔣母墳莊祭別後，即往溪口武嶺學校向該校千餘學子訓話，諄諄勸勉，每個學生都成爲好國民。嗣即與溪口父老吿別，自蔣族長文炳以下，羣祝主席夫婦政躬康泰，並望明年淸明再來溪口。主席夫婦一面說「好」，一面祝父老們保重身體並勸他們回去。主席轉身抱幼孫愛國說聲「再會」，情至和靄親切。嗣即偕夫人携長孫愛明登車赴機塲，乘美齡號專機來杭，抵此後，下榻於膺白路四十九號官邸。又主席蒞杭，隨行者有軍務局長兪濟時，總務局長陳希曾，秘書周宏濤，曹聖芳，參軍施覺民。警衛室主任石祖德留奉未同來杭。蔣經國夫婦及蔣主席在官邸稍事休息並午餐後，即於二時四十五分，偕浙省府主席沈鴻烈赴紹興謁禹陵。紹興全縣人士聆悉主席蒞止，咸極感奮。主席等於蕭紹途中，見日僞破壞殘跡，頻頻指示加以整修。下午四時四十五分抵紹興，全縣人民夾道歡迎。主席等當在縣商會梢事憇息後，即赴禹王廟祭祀，對禹王廟一切損壞之處，即囑專員鄭小隱，縣長林澤加以修葺，當地禹之後襲姒氏宗族，均來晋謁。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十一日電〕主席夫婦十一日午後由杭赴紹興，謁禹王陵掃墓，六時廿分由紹返杭，於七時半到達。今晚宿杭，約一二日後返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社杭州十一日電〕蔣主席於十一日下午五時抵達紹興南門，改乘汽艇直駛禹陵，稍事休息，即往禹王座前拜謁並獻花圈後，略進茶點，復在禹陵四週環顧片刻，六時離陵。八時許遄返杭州行轅休息。按禹陵在浙省紹興東南會稽山，宋乾德中，立禹廟於會稽，明洪武中，禁人採樵，主席深敬其爲人與事業，特抽暇前往瞻謁。</p>
<h3>西子湖畔迎主席</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州訊〕蔣主席的故鄉奉化溪口，自從勝利到現在，整整一年多的歲月中，無時無刻不切盼着蔣主席的蒞止，但因爲他身繫全國的安危，有很多事要處理，一直遲至今年的四月二日才有錦旋之舉。在故鄕，足足躭了一九天，他深感着家鄕父老子弟的忠誠可愛，他欣悅於這種溫暖的在杭州的人們，也惦念着蔣主席的消息，雖然在勝利後第二天的春天，他惠然蒞臨，但他們還有望有一個機會再見一見崇高偉大的蔣主席。</p>
<p>在前兩天，立法院院長孫科副院長魏道明，國防委會秘書長王寵惠都從南京到杭州來遊覽，由京赴吳興掃墓的陳果夫，陳立夫兩先生也轉道到杭州來了。許多杭州市敏感的人在這樣的猜想着：「蔣主席也要蒞臨吧！」</p>
<p>十日下午，我們得着西子湖濱大華飯店由杭州市政府包定房間的消息，於是我們各處探聽的結果是：「主席計劃要到杭州來的，但那一天來都沒有決定」。　十日下午五點多鐘，主席在溪口才決定到杭州來轉一次，十一日上午六點鐘消息才傳到了杭州</p>
<p>那天上午，由寗波　口機塲先起飛了兩架侍從人員的機子，他們先到杭州來準備一切。</p>
<p>主席在這一天按例起得很早，和着夫人漫步到武嶺學校去，對武陵學校全體師生訓話。主席以誠懇仁慈喜愛的情懷對着許多師生說，要他們秩序做一個好國民，夫人也如此說。訓話完畢後，主席和夫人就登上備好了的小轎車到機塲去。主席和夫人揮揮手，持了禮帽，點點頭，就此登上飛機了。</p>
<p>將近十二時，主席座機在杭州的上空出現。機塲上迎候的浙省府主席沈鴻烈，省黨部主委張強，保安副司令竺鳴濤，杭州市長周象賢，翹首企望主席的降臨。</p>
<p>機子漸漸地下降，他滑停在機塲的跑道上。機身的門啓處，主席出現在門前，他神采煥發，穿着黑掛藍袍，夫人穿着玄色的旗袍，步下飛機。空軍軍官學校的樂隊奏起三番號的禮樂與國歌。然後主席頷首向歡迎者還禮，由空校敎育長胡偉克呈請主席檢閱官生和士兵，主席點頭還體。</p>
<p>到空校的大禮堂中，稍事憇息，然後又登上預備的座車到膺白路四九號的官邸了。</p>
<p>主席，這位仁慈崇高的巨人，他已兩次來杭州了。這表示他關切兩浙人民的生活，他喜愛這湖山的美麗，但是我們在兩浙的人要靜靜地想呀！他老人家如此的關愛我們，我們將以什麼來報答他呢？（儲裕生）</p>
<h3>敎濟德惠難胞　主席撥款急賑</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十日電」蔣主席軫念德惠受戰之難胞，生活痛苦，特令撥流通券五千萬元，飭由政院轉令東北保安長官部等機關會同赴德惠發放。茲悉，各該機關已分別派員攜帶賑款，馳赴德惠，當即在該地組織急賑金發放委會，於日昨發放竣事。</p>
<h3>陳果夫等晉謁主席</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十一日電〕陳果夫·陳立夫等，十一日下午一時前往膺白路官邱晋謁蔣主席晤談。稍頃即辭別，乘二時火車轉滬返京。</p>
<h3>魯南國軍後方　加強綏靖工作　蘇北海泰綫兩側激戰</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十一日電〕魯南國軍爲加强後方綏靖工作，日來已將臨棗支綫，台棗支綫兩側地區之零星共軍掃蕩凈盡。共軍兩千餘，由南北棠蔭經金陵寺東竄，十日在泥溝被國軍夾擊，生俘百餘，殘餘共軍狼狽東竄，十一日晨復被國軍在台兒莊東北十五公里之邢家樓包圍，正聚殲中。又西集及齊村附近地區，已無共軍跡。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日電〕魯南山區大戰仍在醞釀期間，十一日據報，共軍主力在沂水一帶者五個縱隊，在新泰·萊蕪·蒙陰者三個縱隊，在費縣附近者一個縱隊，濟南外圍者爲第十縱隊，係解七·解十一兩師及警七旅所合編。連日共軍由各地向山區積極轍送械彈，非戰鬥員及物資則運黃河北岸利津，霑化一帶，共軍恐國軍在沿岸登陸，現成立海防司令部，區域由新浦到靑島，膠濟綫無戰事，濟國軍游擊可到章邱。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十一日電〕國軍十日續向濬縣以北之老官嘴·五陵集一帶之殘部共軍大舉掃蕩，斬獲頗衆。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣十一日電〕蘇北此次殘餘共軍自李堡一役後，刻流竄至海泰綫兩側騷擾，泰縣丁縣長率全部保安隊赴姜堰淸剿，連日在該路兩側展開激戰。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十一日電〕豫北共軍劉伯誠殘部，刻已陷日暮途窮之境，其二三六等縱隊殘部，十日下午已當竄至湯陰以東內黃以西地區，其獨一。獨二兩旅及十七師發部，已竄抵湯陰西北地區，國軍刻正跟踪追擊中。</p>
<h3>接收大連無進展　龔學遂延期出發　共軍正以大連為補給庫</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕接收大連如蝸牛爬牆，毫無進展。龔學遂原定今日北來，因故展期。據今自瀋來平關係方面談，接收大連困難甚多：（一）蘇聯通知政府接收之大連，僅限於鐵路綫以西之狹窄區域，僅當民國廿五年大連市區之半，若與民國三十年日本擴大之「大大連」市區比較，則更爲可憐，且大連市仰給之水源地腰子窩，亦被蘇方劃歸蘇聯駐軍區，大連如此被肢解，已不成一市。（二）蘇方不同意國軍進駐大連，僅可由警察保安隊前往維持治安，且最近蘇方一再表示，希望中國行政人員先往接收。在中共軍控制大連情勢下，非武裝行政人員，一旦進入，即有成爲俘虜可能，實談不到接收。發言人並指出，共軍刻正以大連爲其山東作戰之補給庫，決不甘輕易放棄。（三）普蘭店方面，雖亦曾經中蘇軍方談判，但蘇方代表，階級甚低，難於負責，且代表時有更易，故始終談不出結果。（四）除上述外，接收旅大基本困難尙多，蓋中一蘇條約中文本與俄文本文字頗多一差異，如中文本規定中蘇各有大一連港口設備之半，而俄文本則解釋爲蘇方先取去一半，剩下設備給中國。其中如旅大之疆界，旅順駐軍辦法，皆未詳細規定。中長路情形亦復如此。又蘇方在大連購房地產極多，將來亦成問題。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十一日電〕大連問題仍有枝節，我向蘇方提出之六項條件，尙無確切答覆之期。蘇一方聲稱之可作政務接收，障碍未除。然準備工作仍積進行，資委會所屬單位之接收準備工作，業已完成。據悉，大大連工廠有千餘家。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕陳總長於歡迎李承晚鷄尾酒會席上稱，旅大附近不能謂無共軍，以國軍之力量’擊單對付共軍，當無多大問題。言下似暗示此事除軍事問題外，尙須循外交途徑解決。</p>
<h3>張自忠蔡元培國葬　國防最高委員會例會通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕國防會十一日開會時對隕業代表在立法委員名額中應佔數額，曾加討論，決議仍維國防會當時所作決議，職業代表佔一一九名。（按：立院討論時已將其改爲五十六名），並將該案交入立院覆議，俟孫科返京後，該案即可提出計議。又職業團體聯誼會，十一日曾派代表陶桂林等赴國防會請願，由梁寒操接見。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕國防最高委員會今日上午九時，在國府會議室舉行第二二七次例會，于會員右任主席。到出席列席委員卅餘人決議要案如下：（一）通過張自忠。蔡元培，予以國葬。關於各方請求公葬案件，交行政院依照公葬條例酌核辦理。（二）安徽。江西監察使陳肇英，河南山東監察使郭仲隗，任期屆滿，着予連任。（三）任命孫鏡亞爲監察院監察委員。　行政院擬送配合整軍計劃實施建警方案暨實施建警試行警員制方案，修正備案。（五）行政院爲司法院解釋卅四年八月十五日起，人民隱匿或購買敵偽物資者，分別成立刑法上贓物罪，與該院規定卅四年十月一日爲敵產停止移轉日期，逾期者無效相抵觸，請核示案，決議照司法院解釋辦理。（六）行政院送財政部直接稅·貨物稅超收提獎辦法，修正通過。</p>

<h3>雷震抵滬　邀張君勱赴京簽署共同綱領</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕雷震氏昨晨由京抵滬，民社黨蔣勻田氏回來。聞雷氏此來係邀同襲君勱氏赴京，簽署共同施政綱領·民社黨政務委員人選，俟日內商定後，即與府委人選，一併提出。該黨人士表示，對政院部會，暫時不擬參加。至外傳該黨分裂之說，該黨發言人鄭重吾認。渠表示民主之政黨，自不能避免發生不同意見，所有流言，均屬不確。</p>

<h3>努力復興中之南通</h3>
<p>— 本報記者章繩治</p>
<p>「滔滔長江，巍巍紫琅，學校林立，工商興旺」。此爲南通風光一輪廓。</p>
<p>南通在過去頗負盛名，曾被譽爲模範縣，但遭八年敵僞之摧殘，以致面目全非，幾瀕破產境地，自勝利以還，雖經努力復興，終爲人力物力所限，一時難復舊觀。</p>
<p>艱苦經營五十年　地方建設具楷模</p>
<p>南通各種事業，如分別與他處作單獨比較，未見有何特殊，其所以博得模範縣之名者，實以各項建設均有整個之計劃，及一貫之精神，五十年前艱苦經營，與今日之建國方策，不謀而合，如當前政府所倡導之增加生產，農村工業化，培　技術人才，訓練師資等等，南通均有具體而　之微型，其見重於世，蓋在於此。　叵憶南通鄉紳張　庵（季直）於五十年前從事地方建設，其動機乃在救亡圖存，在光緖甲午中日戰後，力主以實業富國，以敎育智民，當時曲高和寡，乃情而還鄉，謀就地方樹立　橫。首先創辦大生紗廠，二年以後，以紗廠所得盈餘，開辦通州師範，並附設農工測繪等科，此即爲南通學院之前身、復以紡織原料缺乏，乃於蘇北沿海，關土墾荒，提倡植棉。至民國十年左右，各項事業蓬勃河上，乃以範圍過廣，當特政治經濟條件不能配合，以致為債務所累，幾陷停頓。就經濟立塲言，當時南通事業自有失策，但就整個國家社會立塲言，則不能謂無相當成功，　　爲　　增加生產，培養師費，　　技術人才，對國計民生供獻甚大也。</p>
<p>敎育紡織漸復原　鹽墾猶在停頓中</p>
<p>論南通地方事業，可分三大部門，即敎育，紡織，與鹽墾是。餘如麵粉·油·鐵·運輸。倉庫。以及慈善事業，均與此三部相聯緊。此次記者團訪問蘇北，道過通邑，曾晤及大生紗廠總經理張敬禮，並參觀所有各事業機構，深覺蘇北十年來處此兵荒馬亂之境，而南通獨能首先復員，仍本過往貫之精神，作有系統之逐步復興，實難能而可貴。據張氏談稱：目前南通地方事業除敎育紡織二部工作已積極展開外，惜鹽墾區以治安尙未完全確立，一切猶在停頓之中，此對整個蘇北農村經濟之影響，殊深且鉅。總之，南通之一切事業，係爲一「整套」而有計劃之組織。以敎育一項而論，南通華院農科過去注重棉作，尤重棉種改良，以適應需要，此與一般農科性質是爲不同之點，至紡織一科，尤稱特點，蓋目前全國各紡織技術人員，類皆脫胎於此也。餘如醫科着重農村醫師之培養，故畢業校友多在內地或軍隊服務。通州師範，於抗戰期內，全部被毀，片瓦無存，但以該校爲通邑敎育之母，故決心首先恢復，近以八十萬萬元作爲建築經費，當記者前往參觀時，基地已成，正擬架設鋼骨，預期半年後即將完成，暑期中已可開始招生參。女師以損毀較輕。已漸次修復，統計全校現有高中師範科五級，初中十級，學生七百九十八人。</p>
<p>南通醫院，戰前設備充實，抗戰之初，奉令隨軍內遷，所有設備，毀失殆盡，現已呈請政府將敵遺之江北醫院交由南通學院作爲附屬醫院，目前醫療工作百分之九十爲救濟傷兵及難民，因全係義務性質，故影響於醫院之復興殊鉅。</p>
<p>關於大生紡廠部份，計分一廠副廠及三廠，共有紗錠十四萬，布機一千五百台，戰前每年產紗十二萬包，布一百餘萬疋，用棉五十萬担，抗戰期間，損失頗重，故勝利以後產量大减，嗣經努力恢復，最近產量已達戰前百分之八十，按照原先計劃，蘇北全區爲五十萬錠，如今後環境順利，不難逐步實現，又南通農民向以織布爲副業，戰前銷行東北四川等地達一千萬疋以上，但該項出品全係手工木機，故現正由工程師從事調查研究，擬協助農民改良，使成本减輕，品質改良，以充裕農村之經濟。次一步計劃，紡織漂染整理三過程聯成一氣，更籌備立漂染廠，預計明年即可完成，每日可漂染布四千疋。</p>
<p>南通工業之原動力，全部由天生港之電廠所供給，現有電力五千七百瓩，迨明年新機運到，可增至一萬二千瓩。同時並計劃完成三萬瓩之電力，以供給通如海之需要。</p>
<p>此外，蘇北尙有一廣大之富源，即爲鹽墾區是也。接蘇北鹽墾之開辦，始於前淸光緖二十七年，初由張嗇庵就南通呂四塲創立通海墾牧公司，又於民國三年創立大有晋公司，擇海濱較高淤灘開築海堤，規劃開墾，行之十年，成效大著，昔日荒灘不毛之地，一變而爲阡陌相通廬舍相望之區，於是各鹽墾公司相繼設立，自南而北，所轄地畝共三百餘萬畝，已墾熟之地約二分之一，農民直接依以爲生者近二十萬人，間接受益者不計其數，年產籽棉二百萬担，以大中集三餘鎭之改良棉種最著成效，於紡織原料供獻甚鉅。然近年來因受時局影響，農村凋敝，復員工作急不待緩，咸認爲今後開發，必須做到下列各項：（一）確保農村治安，一切始可循序推進。（二）舉辦緊急農貸，請中國農民銀行低利貸款以蘇農困。（三）修理堤閘河道，（四）自南通至漣水開闢新運河，計長二百五十公里，目前如以工代賑，發動八萬難民從事工作，需麥三十九萬担，四個月可完成。（五）開闢引河二十四條，以導水人海，同時築堤建閘，以調劑水量。</p>
<p>最後，復據張敬禮談稱，以上計劃，根據四五十年之經騐，深信將蘇北建設爲棉紡業重心，頗有把握，蓋南通建設己早有基礎故也。</p>
<h3>公債加倍還本說不確　不能與私人債務相提義並論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕財部公債司某要員談：公債加倍還本說，純係臆測，蓋就公債主管立塲而言，政府對於發行各項公債，自應遵照原訂規則按期償付本息、以維國信，至於因幣値貶落而須加倍償還，此不特增加政府預算，即對業已償付之公債持票人，亦欠公允，蓋不能與私人債務及銀行存款等相提並論。現政府尙未還清之公債，計有戰前發行之統一公債及復興公債等六七種，戰時發行者有國防建設公債等十餘件，現均按照規定如期抽箴還付本息。</p>

<h3>防火責任在人民</h3>
<p>都市社會的生活，需要安全和安定。但今日的上海，市民生命財產，及工商業的物資器材所最易感受到的一種威脅，便是火災的襲擊。爲了消極的防止火災，市行政便有消防行政的部門，以防止和消滅火災爲任務，從而保全市民的生命財產。上海號稱爲東方的大都市，事實上亦爲中國第一都市，工商繁榮，人口密集；而市政的窳敗，建築的不良，消防行政的支離，與夫一般人道德觀念及責任觀念的貧乏，亦爲衆所周知的事。現在時屆春夏之交，轉瞬氣候炎熱，如不積極豫謀火災之防止，則市民生命財物隨時可以感受到威脅，這確是當前上海市一個重要的問題。</p>
<p>上海市自獻歲以來，火警迭起，災害頻聞。武定路的大火，延燒至十三小時，半條馬路的房屋物產，和被災者的多年心血，悉化灰燼難於復蘇。此次災害，爲消防行政的大考騐，論理應於羣情譁然之下，積極謀改良與進步。又此次災害之慘痛，論理一般市民應有謹愼心理，以减少或消滅造成火災的原因。然依統計：今年一月份，上海市火警共八八次；二月份則减至一一三次；三月份竟增至一五四次：四月一日至十日，已達五十一次；平均一日三次火警，且災情均屬空前。以十日來頻報中的火警情形推斷，本月份火災次數，可能凌駕三月份數字而上。看各月火警災害之慘重，誠令人寒慄心驚，尤其本月九日南潯路茂昌堆棧的大火，焚燒將近三十小時以上，行總大批救濟物資，均付之一炬，總共之損失數字，已無可統計；其災情壓過武定路，已構成上海空前的大火災，則毫無疑義。事態如此嚴重，爲上海市十年來所僅見。而來日方長，禍福難卜，我們懲前毖後，不能不向市當局和市民，作「當心火警」的緊急呼聲。</p>
<p>「當心火警」，人人有責；不完全責在政府，亦不完全責任人民。因此，政府必須要在行政措施上「當心火警」：市民必須要在生活起居上「當心火警」。過去武定路大火案，羣情痛斥消防人員之腐敗，自有幾分道理，而大多善良消防人員，感受毀譽便撫膺短氣，幸吳市長安慰有方，消防人員倍加警惕奮勉。數月以來，火警頻傳，各區消防人員疲於奔命，在低劣的物質條件下，倍見努力，其服務精神實至可佩，夷考數月來造成數百次火警的原因，尤其茂昌堆棧的大火，半亦由咎在市民生活起居的有失嚴謹，工商機關管理的有失疏忽，致演成連續不斷之災害。職是之故，今日「當心火警」，人人有責，必須人人警惕，人人奮勉，始克有濟。</p>
<p>市當局在行政措施上，講求「當心火警」之道，應針對數日來造成火警的原因，應積極的從事火災之防止。其一，上海經八年戰爭以來，大部公私建築之電料器材及裝置多已陳舊，一遇潮濕卽發生走電現象，故應速作電綫檢查，和公司行號家庭電器設備之安全檢查。其二，數日來釀成火災之重大原因爲易燃液體，有的是使用烹飪致火，有的是備藏引火，尤其烹飪使用火油，較汽油容易成災，應作合理的限制和取締。以三月份統計而論，一五四次火災中，虹口及楊樹浦共達四六起，大部爲使用易燃液體烹飪起火。爲廣大市民的生命財產計，不可不限制取締。其三，上海人口密集，且多非生產部門所需。爲社會經濟政策着眼，應講求人口之疏散，以避免人口集中都市共而限制人口之遷入，亦有必要。然於目前最重要的，則爲取締擱樓，遷移棚戶，與制止不利于消防之各種建築。以上各端，僅就犖犖大者而言，市行政一般的效率缺乏，工務警局及消防處，均與直接消防和間接消防有關。消極消防如充實消防設備等，可以加强消滅火災於有形，但積極消防如講求完美，則可以積極防止火災於無形。此行政上「當心火警」之道也。</p>
<p>市民「當心火警」之道，心理上首先必須樹立道德觀念，行爲上更須時時處處謹愼。根據數月來的統計，數百次的火災，以家庭發生火災致釀巨禍者為最多，烹飪失火者有之，使用電熱失火者有之，烟囱飛火者有之，甚至敬神拜佛起火者有之，足徵家庭生活起居之不愼，實為造成火災的一個主因。至於公司行號或機關方面，尤應加緊管理，提高效率：防火設備必求其充實，經常保持在一個可以應用的狀態下，以免臨時失效。凡足以引火的燃料，化學材料及其它器材，均應予以安全之貯藏。月前招商局第一碼頭之火警，據傳係由所堆存之「過氣化鈉」起火，可見管理一有疎忽，災難隨時可以發生。</p>
<p>昨據報載本市已發現有共黨組織之「放火隊」，利用小孩，企圖造成災害，其用心之毒，實堪痛恨。本市治安當局對於此等害行，固應隨時須加以密切注意；就是每個市民，亦應協助，嚴加防範。我們不能讓有用的物資化作灰燼，市民的生命財產遭受損害，必人人起來負起消防的責任！</p>

<h3>英美已同意法國要求　薩爾歸法國統治　惟反對魯爾區脫離德國　蘇聯意反對我為對德和約召集國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十日電〕美英二國今日在外長會議同意法國要求，將七百三十八方哩之蘇爾區及其八十六尤三千人口（內大部份係德人）自德國割歸法國單獨統治。美國務卿台馬歇爾並建議由外長會議採取初期步驟，實行此事。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫定於明日發表聲明。至於法國要求魯爾工業區脫離德國，馬氏與英外長貝文均表示反對。馬氏並反對在魯爾設立特別行政機構及由國際共有或共管該處工業資源。法國要求係外長皮杜爾所提出，渠並要求準許萊因區獨立，但遭貝文拒絕。皮氏宣稱，魯爾區煤礦與冶塲所有權應讓予「對德作點各國」，且在聯合國安理會「保護」下設立魯爾特別行政機構，萊困區應永久駐紥「相當軍力」，以防德國將來侵略。莫洛托夫對此未有表示。貝文則稱，預防德國最安全之保證爲美國所提出之四國公約。馬氏旋又折回修改德波疆界問題，希望盟國切勿採用以武力爲後盾之疆界。據稱，此種疆界不能作爲和平之良好基礎。同時波蘭外交部發言人重行聲明目前西部疆界已屬最後決定，不容變更。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十日電〕四國外次會議本日決定要求外長會議展延二日，由其完成起革對德和約程序之報吿書，按此項報吿書原定於本日完成。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十一日電〕四外次會議今晨開會時，蘇聯代表反對中國爲對德和平會　召集國之一項提議，反之，英美兩國則堅持中國應爲召集國之一。同時，會期之日期，地點及組織應立即提請中國政府核准。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十一日電〕據美國國務卿馬歇爾兩日前之暗示，渠在四外長會議結束前不致離開莫斯科，亦不要求會議延長。馬卿熱切希望議程討論完畢，不惜對各項問題重新展關討論，以謀成立最後協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十一日電〕四外長今晨開會時，英外相貝文已同意對德和平條約應由德國中央政府簽字之一項提議。</p>
<h3>對德和約獲致協誶　實為和平唯一希望</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十日電〕德境美國佔領軍總司令克萊將軍本日舉行記者招待會，德國記者首次獲准提出問話，有以德國中央政府之將來，請其加以評論者，克萊中將曰：德國中央政府之權限，必須嚴格規定，且必須受各邦權限之限制，然後美國始同意德國成立中央政府，余仍認爲四强對於德國之將來，有獲致協議之可能，此乃和平之唯一希望。德國問題實爲戰後最難解決之問題。以言魯爾區最近發生煤礦工潮，受其影饗者，僅德國人民而已。至於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫最近發表聲明，力言蘇聯所取得之賠款，較英美爲少，此說是吾可靠，因蘇聯未向盟國管制德國委員會提出報吿，故蘇聯所獲得賠款之確數，殆無一人能知之云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十日電〕關於戴高樂將軍二次發表演說，法國各大政黨採取堅强立塲，但政府方面完全保持緘默。據總理賴瑪迪談稱：戴氏之演說，並未能使法國內閣之見解有何變更，最近渠所發表之意見，並未造成新局勢，需要內閣開會討論之云。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾致函莫洛托夫　譴責蘇對韓政策　主張即重行召開美蘇聯合委會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十一日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾，今日譴　蘇聯造成朝鮮之嚴重經濟困難與使盟國在朝鮮之政策失敗。渠提議在今夏召開蘇美兩國會議，以便檢討盟國在朝鮮之政策。馬歇爾致函蘇外長莫洛托夫，要求兩國政府訓令朝鮮之蘇美兩國駐鮮陸軍司令立即重行召開在韓久已停頓之美蘇聯合委員會。渠　求稱：根據一九四五年莫斯科協定之條款，「基於尊重言論自由之民主權利」，渠兩人實負有立即恢復渠等工作之責。馬歇爾又作警吿稱：美國認爲除此而外，別無他途可循，希望在朝鮮美佔領區中，立即採取此項步驟，不再延誤，以便推行莫斯科協定中規定之目約，並設立韓國臨時政府作爲走向韓國獨立之初步。</p>
<h3>美援助希土方案　安理會展開激辯　希代表亦出席陳述意見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕美國代表奧斯汀為杜魯門之援助希臘土耳其方案辯護。奧斯汀否認蘇聯代表葛羅米河所謂此舉干涉希臘內政，謂希土兩國曾直接要求美國援助，且與聯合國憲章相符。奧氏要求安理會展期討論蘇聯土情形之建議，因美國之援助方案尙在國會討論中，美國本身不知將採取何種方式。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功能湖十日電〕聯合國希臘代　表即駐美大使丹特拉米斯本日在安全理事會辯論美總統杜魯門援助希土二國之計劃時，率直指斥希臘北鄰諸國企圖向希臘人民騙售共黨獨裁制度，並支持美國要求聯合國贊助杜魯門之計劃，丹氏聲稱：「希臘所以不斷發生糾紛之原因，皆由於希臘北部疆界外所給予希臘少數份子之助力此等少數份子擬以強制手段迫使希臘採取共產黨之獨裁制段迫使希臘採取共產黨之獨裁制度」。先是，波蘭代表蘭琪曾向美代表奧斯汀挑戰，促其在聯合國組織內公開宣佈，使杜魯門計劃成為有實施必要之「極權主義」威脅是否即為蘇聯。奧斯汀對此置之不顧，而希臘代表丹特拉米斯則否。丹氏力言美國爲希臘困苦人民所能獲得有效援助之唯一國家，並反對蘇聯組織安理會特別委員會負責處理任何援助希臘享宜之建議。</p>
<h3>美已與十五國家　簽訂航空權協定　多數係以剩餘物資為交換條件</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十日電〕國外淸理委員會今日公佈，美國已完成對十五國家之航空權利恊定，此項協定包括海外剩餘物資之處置問題。至此，美國航空公司乃有權飛行各該國內之航綫，運用導航設備，通訊工具，氣象報告及滿段全球之機塲。美國運抵牠國之援助品，多係剩餘物資，此項物資在多數情形下，充作美國取得資在多數情形下，充作美國取得飛行權之交換條件。若干航空站台現暫由美航空公司人員負責管理，幷在當地訓練技術人員，以資應用。按此項協定包括中國在內。</p>
<h3>美電話工潮　暫無解決希望</h3>
<p>紐傑賽州職工拒絕復工</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕美電話業罷工領袖拒絕資方所提出對主要長途電話工會妥協解決辦法之建議，今夜對四日之久之全國電話罷工迅速解決之希望，又成泡影。全國電話工人聯合會主席貝尼稱：公司方面之建議，不能使人滿童，惟渠對繼續談判之門，仍將保持開放。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十日電〕紐傑　州州長特利斯科爾已於昨日發表侖令，禁止罷工，並謂電話工人於今日午後四時前若仍不復工，則將處以罰鍰或監禁。美國電話工會執行委員會乃令該州電話職工拒不復工，並指斥此項會令不僅違背憲法，抑且具有法西斯色彩云。</p>
<h3>美援助希土方案　參院一致通過　范登修正案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕參護院本日一致通過參院議長范登堡所提出之修正案，杜魯門總統以四億美元援助希土兩國之建議，於是遂消除其第一次主要難關。根據該修正案之規定，如果安全理事會之（否決權不適用）多數代表或聯合國大會之多數代表認爲不必或不應再援助希土兩國時，聯合國有隨時停止美國援助工作之權，杜魯門總統亦有權隨意或在希臘或土耳其直接要求之下停止援助工作，參議院同時幷一致通過另一修正案，即杜魯門所任命之該計劃主持人員應得衆議院之同意，又美國經費不得用爲償付希臘或土耳其外債之需。參議院今日之突然加速行動，實由於共和黨參議員塔虎脫之第一次全力支持杜魯門阻遏中東共產主義之計劃。民主黨參議員康納利曾力斥蘇聯爲侵略國家，而民主黨參議員裴柏駁以美國正在遺棄故總統羅斯福之政策，幷從事於對蘇聯之「不宣而戰」。當二人正在激烈爭論之際，塔虎脫發言稱，渠將投票贊成杜魯門總統之計劃，蓋吾則將被蘇聯視爲美國聲望之掃地。塔氏並表明，渠幷不認爲此項計劃乃同樣援助其他國家之先例。此間人士認爲范氏修正案之一致通過，可解釋爲整個援助計劃在本週杪或下週初提付最後表決時，亦將博得絕大多數之擁護云。</p>

<h3>「期滿終止租約」　與大會決議抵觸</h3>
<p>張參議員發表意見</p>
<p>記者昨以立法院房屋租賃條例草案，叩詢市參議員張一渠意見，據談：最近本市房荒，益趨嚴重。對於房屋租賃條例更應縝密麗訂。本人曾於市參議會第一次大會時提案，規定原承租人有艦　承租權，當經大會通過在案。頃查立法院房屋租賃條例草案第九條（參議會現改爲第十條）第六項規定「約定租賃期限已屆滿者」出租人得終止契約，核與「原承租人有繼績承租權」之大會決議案完全抵觸。該草案第九條（參議會現改爲第十條）第六項應修正爲「約定租賃期限已屆滿，原承租人無續租必要者」，方覺妥適。吾則，承租人將永無安居樂業之日。因本市最近房屋約定租賃期限，　　一年，少則六個月三個月下等。如果約定租賃期限屆滿時，必須終止契約，不予　租，則　個上海市終日在動盪之中，勢必引起崩潰性之普遍糾紛，危險孰甚云云。</p>

<h3>市長邀各業領袖　商遏止物價漲風　中央具有平抑物價決心　深信命令即可到達</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市及南京兩地，中樞前已指定作爲嚴格管制物價地區，當局一致認爲京滬兩地對於全國之金融與物價，具有領導作用，必予全力平抑漲風。吳市長昨日自京出席物價會議歸來後，即於下午四時，在市府會議室召集本市棉紗，食米，麵粉，食油等各業領袖會商切實抑平之辦法。出席紗業沈伯樂，棉布業董久峰，豆米業邢志剛，顧益生，染織業潘士浩，榨油業邱良榮，中國食油公司王仰他等。由吳市長就棉紗，食米，食油，麵粉四項主要日用品，分別報吿中央已擬有具體平抑辦法，深信約一星期後命令可抵達此間，在正式議價未公佈前，過渡時期中之戢止漲風辦法，經商討如下：</p>
<p>紗廠切弗爭先購棉</p>
<p>（一）棉紗——市長稱：紗價之上下，在乎棉花，若花價穩定，紗價自無上漲理由。在本年新花上塲之前，政府必有妥善辦法，各廠切勿學先搶購。又紗商之棉紗買賣交易，必須依照紡管會訂定辦法辦理登記，吾則經濟監察團將予逮捕。</p>
<p>政府洋料決予拋售</p>
<p>（二）食米——爲謀米價之迅速抑平，政府控制下之洋米，決予拋售，其拋售辦法，待糧食部次長龐松舟今晚由京抵滬後洽商決定之。據吳市長稱：京滬一帶食米，絕不至有恐慌現象。關於有人向產米區大量收買食米，致使米價上漲情事，省政府已派員赴鎭江，無錫，蘇州等地密查。又本市物價評議會決定之白粳價格每石不得超過十四萬一節，吳市長表示「不能加以承認，然亦並不加以千涉」。盼望米商能與政府精誠合作，待龐次長來滬後，將再召集米商代表共謀善策。</p>
<p>油價議決三十五萬</p>
<p>（三）食油——昨日食油之市價爲每担四十萬元，吳市長認爲價格過高，太不合理，昨日出席會議之榨油業及植物油料廠代表亦自認價格太高，一致決議，自即日起不得超過卅五萬元，若有黑市交易，由市府嚴格取締之。吳市長稱：本人祇能認爲此卅五萬之價格，乃過渡時期中之暫時市價，中央一星期後可公佈之議價，或較此數爲低。在命令尙未到達以前，暫以卅五萬爲最高價格。</p>
<p>麵粉決仍維持原價</p>
<p>（四）麵粉——市長稱：至目前爲止，麵粉似尙無問題，決雜持原價。然恐有轉賣情事，應予嚴密注童。</p>

<h3>聯合國敎組織在華舉行　基本敎育首屆會議　表示中國立於先驅地位</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦航訊〕聯合國文敎組織執行部之常務委員會，在一九四七年二月在巴黎召開之最近會議，指定「基本敎育」爲一九四七年三大主要計劃之一。但何者爲基本敎育，該組織發言人謂，此語實屬新名詞，非但欲包括兒童敎育之觀念，且欲包括成人敎育也。彼等欲表示此種敎育，非僅爲使人民讀寫，計算，並予彼等以基本敎育，使其能謀生與改進其經濟現狀，能表達自已，改善衛生環境，能參加其國內與國際政府，能獲得一較完全與較佳之生活。惟目前尙無一詞足以包羅上述諸目的，因此乃創造此一新名詞。</p>
<p>具有領導作用</p>
<p>該發言人稱：「若干國家在愁本敎靑方面，已有成功之計劃，其中以蘇聯，墨西哥，土耳其，及中國最爲成功。中國白一九一一年經孫德理之鼓勵，復經蔣主席不斷之推進，故大規模敎育之經騐，即在抗日戰爭中仍得繼續發展，此一事蹟，將永乖育史，而爲敎育上之史詩。」聯合國文敎組織有鑒於中國與文肓抗爭中，立於先驅之地位，故決定於本年六月二日至十四日，（編者按：近接京電，有延至七月一日召開說。）在南京召開其首次「區域研究會議」，亞洲及南太平洋各國及各屬地之專家，供將出席此項會議。文敎組織理事長赫胥黎，於三月十二日致我敎育部長朱家　函中稱：貴國在蔣主席及閣下領導下，於基本敎育方面獲得卓越之工作成績，故吾人認爲文敎組織對此間題之首屆會議在貴國舉行，實最適合，余信於召開此次會議中，中國在最主要方面實具領導作用，此項領導，實與其偉大之傳統以及其目前與將來在世界中之地位相吻合。</p>
<p>四項主要問題</p>
<p>據悉：南京會議，將重視下列四項主要問題，（一）基本敎育之語言問題，（二）閱讀資料問題，（三）識字訓練方面使用新技術，（四）行政及組織方面，包括財政及人事。此外聯合國文敎組織決定與二會員國政府合作，於中國與海地進行「指導計劃」。聯合國文敎組織希望未來在南京舉行三區域會議，將能發展在一九四七年中開始進行之特殊指導計劃，其結果對於中國基本敎育計劃，將最具價値。在中國進行之指導計劃，將包括下列四項主題：（一）使用有助瞭解之工具，敎育成年及少年不識字者，（二）使用視覺之媒介物，敎育不識字之成年，（三）發展敎育成年不識字者，有關衛生敎育，經濟發展與文化發展之簡單敎材，以及促進國際了解之簡單敎材，（四）積極訓練基本敎育之實施工作者。在南京會議舉行後，另一類似之區域會議，將於十一月於墨西哥城舉行，將由中，美，南美各國專家參加。</p>

<h3>英糧食部來華採購　蛋類出口漸有轉機　茂昌棧房失愼損失雖大　但與定貨合約並無影響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨爲我國蛋類出口事，往訪本市茂昌公司總經理鄭源與氏，探詢經過詳情，承詳爲解答，茲分誌其大要如次，渠稱：我國出口之蛋品計分三種：一·冰蛋：英國糧食部擬向我國定購九千噸，價爲每噸英金二百鎊，由冰蛋業公會承辦。該公會因成本關係，迭向輸出推廣委員會請求轉商中央信託局賜予協助，懇由該局負責收購。其製造及齣售之責，則歸冰蛋業公會負之。結果冰蛋業公會與中信局巳於本月四日簽定合同，製造冰蛋五千噸，每噸價爲法幣九百萬元，分五次支付，第一次巳於本月七日辦竣。嗣後依次辦理。現冰蛋業公會各會員，正籌劃收購鮮蛋及布置開工事宜。二·爲乾全蛋片，其數量二百五十噸，價爲每噸英金七百二十鎊，現在商洽中，辦法同上。三·爲乾蛋白一百噸，蜜黃四百噸，現由遠東蛋品製造廠聯營公司，與出口商會同請求輸出推廣委員會轉商中信局協助，不日可望定議。所有上列蛋品三種，英國糧食部亦擬承購。</p>
<p>蛋價平穩</p>
<p>至於目前蛋價，渠認爲尙稱平穩，當不致有何變動。惟盼米價及其他物價亦能平穩。此次該公司南潯路出租棧房部份失愼，據鄭氏事後調查，計損失鮮蛋一萬二千八百三十一件。惟渠稱該項損失，與蛋價並無影響。因損失之蛋，係在冰蛋業公會與中信局簽定合約之前，由本公司所購進，而作額外之準備者，故所遭損失，乃屬額外之準備。惟上項事件，對於與中信局簽定之定貨合同，並無影響。對於本公司製造蛋品之數量方面，亦無影響。因本公司係於上月二十日起籌備復工，本月五日起正式開工，雖於八日夜遭遇不幸，以致照蛋間與堆蛋問全部焚燬。然敝公司可將原爲冷藏及照蛋間堆蛋間而現作普通客貨堆棧者，設法恢復原狀，仍作照蛋間與堆蛋間之用。至於廠內其他製蛋處所，並無損害。故敝公司不日即可復工，對於製蛋數量毫無問題。</p>
<p>損失約計</p>
<p>據鄭氏調查：該公司此次火災損失，計鮮蛋部份約計損失國幣二十四億元，包裝材料方面約計損失國幣八九億元，房屋及設備方面約計損失國幣二十億元。惟鮮蛋及包裝材料，曾經向英商太古公司保險英金六萬鎊。賠償方國，毫無問題，房屋及設備則未保。鄭氏表示：該公司除冷氣堆棧業務照常辦理外，其普通堆棧方面，自即日起，從事逐步結束。所堆普通客貨，一律催令出淸。即出租部份，亦擬商請租戶遷讓，收回自用，免多枝節云。</p>
<h3>市場雖遭受干涉　華股潛勢仍挺秀</h3>
<p>華股昨大戶多頭加碼之意更切，賡續向榮，外來干涉，促成反動囹　，然因各種黑市價格有進無退，外股之助買，跌後屢易回升，晨開時因報載宣司令有公函致市長，內有注意股市之說，致市價見低。開後遞永紗由八五號二二六號一八〇號賣到三一八〇元。一〇六號七六號四號一九八號一八五號七八號一五三號一四五號一七一號一九九號一六七號二二四號均進，新亞中絲勤興次第漲停，遞永紗逐漸盤高至三三三七〇元。三六號一一七號一七七號九九號二三一號逢高賣出而稍平，入後突有外來干涉，人心大恐，九七號一九六號一五六號一二號一〇五號一三三號七六號二三二號八五號爭售。十時半後，橫逆驟起，頃刻之間，一瀉二百餘元，跌至三一三〇元。二〇五號二一八號一七七號趁低進至三二五〇元，九九號四七號一九八號又售，仍難支持，二三五號一九〇號四號二〇七號賣到三一〇元，二一八號四七號六一號一九八號七六號一〇七號一〇五號八號二號一一號紛購，又升至三二一〇元。警政當局派員入塲查看，人心咸以了結爲快。二八號二〇七號二二三號均出，二一八號九七號進後復出，臨收再回低至三一一〇元左右，收後喊價微升，結果較前收計勤興漲半成，新光新華平平，華豐有贈六認三增資訊而微升，永紗信和美亞中法各跌半成左右。遞交計永紗信和美亞跌半成，新光平而華豐微升，冷股永公跌一成弱，大通統益火柴各跌牛成，中絲新亞漲停，餘均平平。、</p>
<p>午後二〇三號一八五號八五號二一八號均進，遞永紗升爲三二一〇元，新亞中絲依然漲停，一八三號九四號一四五號逢高了結，退至三一五〇元。六一號一七一號一八五號一四號二四號一一七號一四二號二二三號二八號二〇七號一〇六號一五二號一五四號連袂購買，又步漲到三三二〇元。二一八號九七號二三五號一四九號一八〇號一四一號一八五號二二三號一九九號再賣，退至三二三〇元。一四號三六號一〇五號一九八號尙進，又迫近三三〇〇元。無如限價供售者頗多，若一九九號一〇六號一三七號三一號一四五號三五號一三一號一八五號以及散戶均賣，塲外繼續查帳，除新光華豐勤興外，後以低價結束，結果較前收計美亞平平，勤興漲一成强，華豐新光升半成左右，中法新華微升，永沙信和微降。遞交計信和跌牛成，新光漲半成，華豐徵升，永紗美亞微降，冷股新亞中絲再停，水泥五和漲一成，永公跌半成，餘股榮辱均見。塲外股除五洲微升外，餘均平和。</p>

<p>公債昨以報載市參議會亦有討論舊債如何整理之訊，人心更俏。大戶若誠德以及五一二室三六〇室有納，五五〇室五〇一室則出。統丙晨開一五〇〇〇元，高價一五七〇〇元，低價一四四〇〇元，最後在一五〇〇〇元左右徘徊。結果較前收計甲乙戊各升一千七，統丙漲一千八，丁種升一千四。成交復達一千萬元。</p>
<h3>外股買胃仍殷</h3>
<p>外股昨以遭禁絕之黑市價猖獗，散買紛來覓取替代物，空方補進，洋行及廣帮均進。怡紗自晨初之三三八〇〇元起步漲至三七〇〇〇元高價而後有回，結果計鋼業成交少而微疲，怡啤微升，英聯漲起一成，餘均好半成。</p>
<h3>棉布生氣蓬勃　人心堅挺喊價升</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况因紡建開售籌碼有限，人心暢而堅挺，市氣蓬勃，喊價續昂。細布塲外交易不弱，並聞天津帮對元色貨及白坯細布不絕搜求。龍頭細布又喊高至十九萬三四千元，五福十八萬五千元，其他各牌亦跟上三四五千元，四君子元嗶嘰更有散戶扒吸價再上揚，四五千元，爲十九萬八千元，金運妙舞及跳鯉嗶嘰亦漲五六千元不一。並漂布元布斜紋府綢等，價亦一致步好，自五六千元至一萬元。士林布高檔貨廠方以成本提高，故市情亦形挺倘。</p>
<h3>人造絲無變化</h3>
<p>昨市八造絲一二〇號高山開盤八百十萬元，因悉確有二千五百箱到埠，故人心異常虛弱，盤旋下挫，最小喊七百九十萬元。後傳聞本週內尙不配售，市况路振，最後復做八百十五萬元賣出，結果與上日軋平。廠經昨市交易甚淡，喊價亦與上日相仿，D字等級零担八百五十萬元有成交。千經殊鮮做開，綢貨被面好去五萬元，大誠格璧開盤喊八千五百至八百元，不乏乘低吸收，以致喊價冉冉上升，最後做價九千三百元單子貨，人造絲貨昨市無甚變化。</p>
<h3>銀樓營業　縮短時間</h3>
<p>銀樓業自財政部另頒營業辦法後，即遵照部令恢復營業，唯以賣出多，兌進少，故頗難持久。據本市銀樓業公會負責人談，外傳銀樓業將再度赴京請願說，銀樓業目前尙無此項計劃，唯爲維持營業之前途計，唯有縮短營業時間。目前本市各銀樓每日上午十時開門，下午四時打烊，並以兌進數量抵付當日之　出數，均不願多售云。</p>

<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千七百餘石，店方實銷並不見旺，進胃平常。粳米回跌三四千元，白元陰元挫落四五千元，秈米亦小二三千元，形成大漲小回之格。　麵粉亦低三五百至千元，洋粉則下降一千四五百元，麩皮成呆疲之局。豆餅客銷冷懈，依然平庸。黃豆供求兩少，東北大豆及漢黃仍趨堅挺之勢，惟杜黃形成軟化之狀。</p>
<p>油市亦因各物下游，隨之反動，豆油在落二萬餘元，生油下跌五六千至萬元不一。蔴油回低萬元，淸油平正。菉豆南洋消化平淡，市勢站立。赤豆廣消見懈，回跌三五千元。紅糧亦然跟跌千餘元，蠶豆則萎靡不振，不脫疲境，步削三五千元。生仁洋莊吸收，續向高峯步進，繼續猛漲萬元，芝蔴原盤。</p>
<h3>烟屑銷路略動</h3>
<p>開平一號烟煤屑二號屑及阜新屑等，上檔貨銷路均略動，然成交價格並不高，烟煤塊趨勢續疲，與煤屑之比價漸見接近。白煤塊高檔貨市况如前，小礦白煤塊，汕頭梅園塊，漢口老龍塊等，到貨尙多，然因品質參次，到貨斷續，推銷頗爲困難，故成交價比例均較前者爲低，約自九十萬元至一百三十萬元之間嗎。</p>
<h3>東北大豆產銷情形　本年共十五萬餘噸　中信局收購佔多數</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十一日電〕本年各地客商來東北收購大豆，迄今止共購一五二·五三一噸，其中以中央信託局收買最多，約五萬噸。惟大部仍積存原購地點，運出之大豆，不過二九·一五〇噸。現東北鐵路運輸能力，每月僅六十萬噸。除去軍運及運煤炭救濟物資以及各工礦材料外，僅餘三萬噸運輸能力，供給各種商貨及大豆運輸之用。</p>
<h3>外銷茶交易少</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，因一片賣聲依然甚囂塵上，而買戶胃納益形呆滯，故人心看疲，全日交易續呈荏弱，市勢再現頹風。至於內銷花色，溫州新龍井以到源蟬聯，情况迄少抬頭，他若各式陳茶，供求缺乏軒輊，市面遂少波動。</p>
<h3>麵粉十三萬包　由溫哥華運滬</h3>

<p>春秋成都文人側影  羅玉君　　一個初春的晴朗的日子，在成都是難得遇見的。寒冷的東風，它那使人戰憟畏縮的威力，不减於北風的暴戾。不過到底是春天來了。你不相信麼？午夜被底的燥熱，破曉時枝頭巧　的鳴萬，庭　裏漸次蘇　的花草，這不是春天的消息麼？　　二月二日，我們大早起床、匆忙梳洗，爲的有珍貴的友情的牽掛，誰也忘不了今天菱窠主人李劼人的招請。我們都準備好了一顆熱誠的心，去聽取那些鋒芒閃閃的議論。還凖備好了一副健全的胃口，去接受那些久負盛名的佳餚。　　十一點鐘車子經過了牛市口的車站，過此就是東向的陽關大道了。說來眞令人不相信，我旅居在這古老的城市已經有十年之久，今天還是第一次到東車站呢。車站周圍那些歪斜着不能避風雨的茅屋，同車站本身的頹敗，眞令我吃驚。中國人的窮困，是英美人士所不能想做的。這倘老大的悲哀的民族，在不論怎樣的惡劣的窮困的環境之下，都可以適應生存。誰給我們這偉大的生存的力量呢？那只有大自然能了解了。　　車子就悴住在上沙河堡的塲上。不容我呆望着業遠的天空和初靑的麥田再發痴想。我們一行四人，都下了車奔向菱角堰的道路。這其間曉舫主張一邊走，一邊問。陳翔鶴則堅信他的經騐與記憶，不問別人。翔鶴與林如稷還有了激烈的爭執。好在是民主的時代，各人都不干涉他人的立塲。不久走到了三叉路口，如稷堅決地說應向左轉。因爲向右的大道，伸向五里外的一個大果園，那里埋藏着他的青春同歡笑，沿途都是印滿了他的悲哀的脚步的。經過這番懇切的解釋，翔鶴的信心有些動搖了，我們都同意間問道旁的農人，以實證如稷的判斷。農人很誠懇的回答道：　　「你們是問那個李敎授麼？寫巴金的麼？就住在坡上的菓園裏。」　　我爲了要轉移如稷的傷心的回憶，忽然浫道：「好　紅的紅土呀！西湖岳王墓道上的紅土不能驕傲了。」翔鶴也湊趣的說道：「這土最適宜培養茉莉花。」我說：「果莉花，梔子花，黃角蘭的香味都太濃太俗，只有蘭的香味才高雅。」剛講到這裏，我忽然想起如稷的亡妻呌淑萬，害怕由「蘭」又引出「蕙」的聯想來，心裏有些窘。幸而赴宴的另一支隊到來，把如稷的注意轉移了。呂朝相說：「從前有一次我剛走到這裏，就聽到李劼老的聲音了。」他在無意間就顯露了他的筆名：聲如「洪鐘」。　　義　沒有衆界，却有一道聲潔的木門。橫楣上寫着「不如與人」。門邊的對聯是「歷刦易翻滄海水、濃春難謝碧桃花。」都用大紅的紙寫着，這顯示示新年的新氣象。同時在字跡語氣裏，我們可以看出　窠主人的豪邁的氣魄。　　門前一片蒲田。曉舫說在初夏的季節裏，微風過處，那種「輕羅裙帶農新蒲」，的景象，一定是很有詩意的。　　我們一進大門，也不管主人的慇戁的讓坐，誰都不願意停留在精緻明凈的客廳裏，大家都貪饞地滿園亂跑，都搶着要尋找一點甚麼更新奇的，不可知的東西。我從前園跑到後園，第一引起我的注意的是八盆盛開的雪蘭，和兩樹綠華靑枝，不凋不謝的檸　樹。它們所陳代謝地，滿足地，開着花，結着果。還有後園那三株盛開的硃沙梅，如靚妝的少婦，又莊嚴，又風流。我看了這一些之後，有一個感覺，感覺春天先來拜訪菱窠，然後才姍姍來遲地走向複雜的都市。　　也許春天是由東方來的。她在　窠已經睜開了她惺松的媚眼，然而在鬧市裏，她又厭倦地掉轉了她疲倦的頭。不然，爲甚麼菱窠的梅先開？爲甚麼美窠的葉後凋？我知道鄕村是大自然的寵兒，盧梭是最懂得這個道理的了。　　主人看見我們這一羣野性難馴的客人，索性領着我們登後山遠望。他站在一座古墳的巓上，手畫口講，我們的眼睛都服徒了他的指揮。那邊是龍泉驛的張飛營，那邊是松理的大雪山，小雪山。那邊在羣峯的脚下。正躺着衰老，偌大的古城。我循着那些密密匝匝的遮藝了人間罪惡的屋頂，想像那其中有一條錦帶似的河流，它把城市的哀樂，都載向遠處，消失在記憶的淡海裏。　　李劼人先生，自從戰爭期間，疎散在菱窠裏後，一直就就樂面忘返。看他庭園的佈置，房舍的修整，好像是預定了百年的大計似的。我懂得他要固守菱窠的陣地，好永遠保持他身心的平曠，以從事於寫作。正如巴黎的紀德，永遠要住在七層的屋頂，以保特他身心的平曠一樣。我初到菱窠時，便有這個感覺。　　午後兩點半鐘了，劉盛亞同陳煒謨還不來，我們的肚皮都湧起了雷鳴的抗議。幸而遠山小姐捧了兩盤點心出來，大家狼吞虎嚥，頃刻間就露出了精緻的古瓷盤底。三點鐘了，盛亞同字謨才大搖大擺地走來。每個人的心底更盪漾着友情的歡笑。他們坐鷄公車來的。他們錯信了車夫的話，繞着菱角堰轉圈子。結果還是下車信託了自己的兩脚，才抵達目的地。載着走不如自己兩脚走，靠人扶起來不如自己站起來。生活到處都在敎訓着我們。　　午餐是四碟五盆，有凉麵，俄國菜，穌魚，蛋捲，鮑魚，冬笋，蟹獎，銀肚，腦花等等。誰說藝術是溫飽後的產品？在我那樣飢餓的情狀之下，我灃是不忽略地，慢慢地咀嚼與欣賞。同座的翔鶴是好「色」而不好「食」的。他曾寫過種花小記，所以我稱他爲好色之徒。他曾說過：「要是我請客嗎？燉一大鍋肉就行了，何必零零碎碎，耗去若干時問與空間，吃起來還不是一口嚥下了。」我不贊成他這種理論，曾經同他開過一塲辯論會。我覺得烹調術是文化的產品，配合成色香味俱佳的美餚，也正如一首完整的詩，或者像一片段理想的人生一樣地憧憬着生命的源泉。因爲集人類口胃的經騐，才產生烹調術，就是這隻經騐的手，又寫出了人類的文化歷史。法國的佛朗士說：「余於未來之圖書館中，將不取閱任何文化史與科學史，僅取閱一時髦之雜誌，詳查某世紀之婦女裝束。此等婦女的衣着，其所示我之時代人文，右過於一切哲學家，小說家，預言家及科學家所示我者。」我現在倣照佛朗士的話，大胆的說一句：烹調術就是文化史。　　我們餐學，每人喝過一杯熟咖啡之後，順着酒酣耳熱的心情，再跑向花園裏去。盛亞向我提議去看井，我就想起東坡先生的思鄕病「分明一夢墜鄕井」來了。我說每個人都留戀他的鄕井，恐怕有水土的意思。王冰洋說鄕井就是鄉村，蒙古人某包俗稱某井。例如市井之徒。如稷這時候忽然指着井邊的一堆離竹大　道：「SY，你的馬房在這裏！」　　如稷的奇異的插曲，把衆人的肚子都笑痛了。因爲如稷是一個堂故專家，常常觸動靈機，連接前因後果，使人不笑不能。剛才在宴席上，盛亞（即SY）自詡他的「春節試馬」，實則同人中他的年齡最小，如稷至此是譏請他幼齡騎竹馬的意思。　　後來翔鶴提議道：「最近有私人文藝團體，諳我們作公開賣票講演，萬一將來有人駡講演者也在借此夥同歛財，怎麼辦？現在被請的都在這裏了，我們來一個決議罷。」這時李劼老以虎步的雄姿，在客廳的中央，一邊走，一邊說道：「我們既答應了，就不能失信於年靑人。我們問心無愧，旣未接受一文的酬報，任人家嫚駡去好了。」過一會他又接着說：「止謗莫如自修。我行我素。」　　這時斜陽從寬敞的走廊上斜射進客應裏來，全室泛着高貴的金波。勝利的晴空、枋彿在爲我們鼓掌。關於王廷紹  子振　　現在所知道的淸代俗曲總集，計有張子虛，「精選時尙咵調太平歌曲」，無名氏，「萬花小曲，「淸音小集」，「西調黃　合鈔」，王廷紹，「霓裳續譜」，失名，「絲弦小曲」，華廣生，「白雪遺音」，無名氏「長岔脆岔合鈔」，等七八種，其中，「霓裳續譜」因有　印本，「白雪遺音」有選本，知道的最多。但這兩書的編者，迄今尙不知道他們的歷史。華廣生大約是姓名不出閔的人士，尋找他的史料，似乎不易。但王廷紹却比較闊氣了。　　「霓裳續譜」王氏自序中無從幾見美生平，僅知他是一個文士而已。但盛安序中却說：「先生以雕龍繡虎之才，平居著述等身。制藝詩歌而外，偶寄閒情，撰爲雅曲，纏綿幽　，追步花間」。當是稍有名望的人物。雖然詳細的歷史還沒有看到，但後面的零星史料，也可略見王氏生平的點滴。　　較詳細的記載是飽桂星「貿生感舊詩鈔」（舊刻本，（卷一冊），卷二云。　　「比部王楷堂同年，諱廷紹，大興人，由庶長改授主事，滯秋曹二十載。兩與禮聞分校，陳三元（繼昌）出門。以風外郎，終年五十有八歲。貧而負氣，傲睨一切。昔吐宏亮，所至驚其座人。詩學少陵，沈著痛快。性　敏，多才藝，斗室中雜蒔花竹；在歌泥飲，灃如也。君長余一歲，鄕會試皆同舉，余罷官，君過從尤數。顧艱於嗣，以姪孝廉（汝弼）子爲子，甫四齡而君遽捐館，嗣孫與孤女並殤，可勝痛悼！」又詩云：　　「翰苑曾三載雲師且廿年，繦中　蔡女，門下有彭宣。不復高談兵，誰將苦句傳，故人頭似　，長慟酒　邊」。鮑氏「感舊詩」中，無一語涉及生年，故王氏生卒也無從推算；僅知鮑中乾隆壬子（五十七年）舉人，嘉慶己未（四年）進士，王氏鄉會兩試旣與之同舉，也當是壬子，己未兩科。又紀昀曾做他的座師，故「瀋陽續錄」卷六有「門人王廷紹」的話。　　又梁章鉅「　聯續話」中曾記其瑣事二則。一見卷三：「王楷堂比部（廷紹）北直人屢與春秋　分校，所得多南省佳士，陳蓮史三元，即出其門」。一見卷四：「王楷堂老於郎曹，家計甚窘。宅邊馬棚，門臨大道，自撰一聯懸於門柱云：「馬骨峻　，吃豈吃麵，兼吃草」，「車聲歷碌，拉人拉馬不拉錢」。見者無不　然」。　　據上列文獻，他的生平是：名廷紹，字楷堂，直隸大與人「霓裳續　自序題秣陵」，乾隆五十七年舉人，嘉慶四年進士，由庶常改授刑部主事，歷十年，以員外郎終，年五十八。家貧性傲好詩。　　續譜自序稱京師曲部所唱之曲，大多口耳相傳，漸歸湮沒，三和堂顏曲師恐其失傳，遂集而付刻。「因多舛誤，請訂於余、……雖强從友人之命，不邋正其亥豕之誤，至鄙俚紙繆之處，固未嘗改訂。題織以後，心甚不安。然詞由彼製，芙不能增我之妍，惡亦不能增吾之醜。」照這話看來，他只是改正誤字，編輯，改訂都沒有過問，實際是個掛名的編輯，大約是曲師，藉王氏之名以自重。這書事實上的編者當是三利堂顏曲師，據書末所附：「萬壽慶典承應雜戲」後有顏氏題詩一首，署「留詞人天津顏自德訂。」所知的也只是他的姓字和里居，其他都無可考了。德那河  科珂秀卡　　科珂秀卡Oskar　Kokoschka(1886-）是德意志現代畫家的傑出者，也是現代新奇畫風中格外新奇的一個。所作油畫，無論人物風景都喜用原色，得意時往往就將顏色瓶直接向畫布擠上去，勿需用筆去調和其他色彩，顏色之厚度超過後期印象派的郭賀（Gokh),故有人稱之爲「北歐郭賀」。但、他的成就較郭賀則差多了。此作爲其代表，可惜單色印刷、不能看出他的好處。（獅）一寸山河一寸血314  葉勁風　　「到達華懋飯店之後呢？」　　「到達華懋飯店之後末，」這傢伙那張啞吧面孔，忽然露出一絲莫明其妙地笑容，「先是小姐再度御可嚀御虛候道左，小姐測量屋宇之高廣，一度剛要升階入內，飯店內之內之廳堂之大門，出行靑年男女二人……　　「嗯…？」鶴見表示驚詫；似乎呌車夫再說得明白些。　　「…靑年男士女士各一人。」說到這裏，車夫　地把那張啞吧嘴，緊緊閉了起來，運通鞠躬了兩次。這是鶴見那一「嗯」招致出來的禮節。再三鞠躬、表示言語不淸，必須抱歉的意思。　　「說下去罷！」鶴見正聽得入神，見那車夫忽然閉口，有些動氣了。　　「是，是是，……男士女士各一名、男士是　　大日本畢軍之　軍服。神采末，飛推朝氣。…女士末，御披大日本學生御制服，花容之精神，煥發如三月之櫻，九月之菊，增加幾分之笑容，一等芙人之姿態……」　　這傢伙大槪在當車夫之前，不是詩人，必是文學家。鶴見和正岩，聽到這裏，雖然滿腹心事，被他這些酸文一轉，也逗得忍不住笑了。他見一「人的神色，有些欣悅，認爲言語雅緻得體，便繼續說道：　　「男士女士，彬彬有禮，見小姐御升階一二級，立迎下階：　　『中村小姐御玉趾下降！』花容女士行禮開始挨　。（註，寒喧。）　　『咦唧……！失之禮，』小姐亦挨　，……含生冷姿態。　　『家兄末，冒味紹介，係代表家長岡本老爺歡迎之誠墾！」三人對禮，男士參加御挨　。男士一露笑容、齒牙之白，如白玉之白……」　　「行哪，行哪！」鶴見恐他再要容形下去，當即剪斷，可特別注意軍夫說那少年一口雪白牙齒。「那男士大約二十歲不足，上圖下尖面孔，笑的時候，眼睛有些瞇起，說話聲音，相當沉低，是不是？」　　「是是，老爺大槪是熟識的嗎？」車夫又插入一次鞠躬。　　「是的，」鶴見瞧了正岩一眼，見正岩聽得也正入社，便轉向室夫問：「後來的事呢？」　　「後來三人，似議論機秘，言語甚輕，愚下無法聽出，祈恕罪……三人議論一時，小姐回身，付給一元二十錢之御虛候代價，另賞愚下二元五十錢，取消租貸，三四碼之程外，有華麗玄色自働車一部，三人相將御登車，愚下亦返車之社行……」　　「那部汽車的號碼，留意了沒有？正岩插問了。　　「10915。」　　「什麼？」鶴見提高了些嗓音，要那車夫再說。　　「愚下的職業，是這一界，嚴留意車式及車之號碼，是爲賤之習慣性……號碼是『10915』　決未記錯」。自由談聯總撥助的費用  常元哲　　聯總給予我們很多的帮助，尤其撥助於四百萬美元的圈和儀　的費用，來補助我國大學設備的不定，這些熟情都僅得我們衷心感謝的。然而，這些費用，已移作購棉花之用，這一舉　，顯然有本末倒置緩急不分之憾。　　八年的戰爭，使我國各大學府的　儀器，損毀大牛，所餘者亦過倖存的一極小部分，戰爭期間，添購圖儀器又很困難，所以學理工的同學們，祇好束手不作實騐，讀點不新穎的，膚淺的舊書，無疑的，這是理工科同學所感到的苦痛。　　渴望的勝利，終於來臨，各大學自然都急於添辦新的　和儀順，據說結匯又很困難，倒是聯總很熟情的贈予一大款項，供我定購圖儀器，以補各大學的不足。敎育本是百年樹人的大計，是不容勿視的。圖是學生的靈魂，知識的泉源，足以啓迪學生的思考，增强他的創造力，儀器是理工科同學的法寳，沒有儀器來實　，就不配學自然科學，紙上談兵，無異於痴人說夢。　　爲了敎育，爲了科學的落後，希望聯總撥助的這筆　儀器費用，能够早一點交還敎育當局，這是千萬工理學子的請求，想敎育當局也有同感吧。老爺錫箔  夢平　　星期日，滬杭綫的貨物車到徐家匯車站的時候，一個押車的車掌喊着說：「老爺錫箔」！「老爺錫箔」！一時筆者弄得莫明其妙，這句話究竟是什麼意思？作何解釋？　　貨物車停止了，車長繼續的說：「老爺錫箔，老王，你數數看，一共多少件，大槪總在二百件以上吧？」筆者探頭向窗外一看，只見許多着責制服的人把錫箔一件件很迅速的投下車站，車長的說話，始恍然大晤。　　車開了，車長又接續說：「這成什麼樣子？國家將亡，必有妖孽，他們偷漏了國家的稅收，他們偷漏了路局的運費。」言下憤憤。　　友人來訪，談起「老爺錫箔」故事。我說：「你們着黃制服的人必竟佔便宜一着，淸明佳節，要人掃墓，錫箔加冠，應感謝抗戰被遣散的軍人。」友人哈哈　　他說：「被遣散的軍人，沒有工作給他做，沒有飯給他吃，他們要求生存，他們不得不想辦法，他們覺得將本求利，雖然偷漏了國家的稅收，路局的運費，但是比起東流西浪，作奸犯科，對得起國家，對得起人民多多。」他又說；「這事鬧了好久，軍警路局毫無處理辦法。」　　毫無處理辦法，實在是拖宕延挨的民族惰性，不了了之政策。不了了之，決不是一個辦法，亦決不是政府應有的態度。新聞綱  鐵雲　　　據說「九一八」事變以後，國際調查團到東北去調查，調查報吿嘗上對於日本完全有利。拆東西洋鏡，調查團足跡所至及所收集的材料，完全都由日本供給。　　根據這個例子，對於什麼「調查團」「訪問團」之類，我們總有些寒心；他們眞能够看到一些眞實的東西麼？從你下車，一直到你走。每一秒鐘。都爲你排定了參觀的「節目」，你有時間「自由」的去看一個你需要訪問的人麼？　　我想「訪問團」諸先生們，對此，一定都是搖頭的。　　一個受了寃屈的人拿了一塊木炭到水裏去洗，他想把木炭洗出白色來。　　這自然是一個　刺。　　但，這個社會裏，有　說不淸的事情也就太多了。　　英商電軍繼續訂約七年，我是中國人，我聽了很悲憤。我反對延長簽約，但我們窮，償不出這筆巨額的款子，又怎麼辦？　　非法入菲的華僑，將由菲列賓「押」回厦門，這個「押」字，使我們讀報的人有點心驚肉跳假假如這六十八位華僑，是非法偷入菲境，也應該送回中國大使館，由中國政府處置，道一「押」，將使全中國人民在世界站不住脚！　　無錫蘇州都發生搗毀報館的事情，有人說，大戰之後人的性情有點變態，雷馬克的「大街」就會經這樣寫過。　　現在看看，到處都在「兇毆」而且成羣結隊地在「搗毀」。中外各一，古有先例，何足道哉　　收回澳門，自然大家舉手！但是香港，九熊爲什麼沒有消息？英國人在香港大有長期久佔的姿勢。　　使人看了笑片而流淚的卓別林，也有人在懷疑他有什麼政治色彩了。他十日在紐約首次招待外記者席上，說得很好，他說：「余並未追求任何主義，僅爲人類進步，及爲渺小人物着想。……」　　車別林不同於一般喜劇演員，大概也即在此。「外強中乾」  雁駢　　——西子賺了多少錢？　　「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」的非虛語。且有：紅男綠女，熙來環往，西子湖畔那裏還嗅得出一絲火藥氣味？每個人都滿意地找到了他要找的目的，進香，逛湖，蜜月旅行，掃墓……同時每個人也付出了他應儲的代價——錢，這若干萬人或多或少的綫聚集起來，據報紙的估計，約有二百億元。　　二百億，在豪門大富的人看來，也許不當一會事；可是在究竟不是一個小數目，它在杭州的社會經濟上，無疑的能發生不小的作用。　　我起先也是作這種想法的，但當我對內幕有了一番認識以後，我作了一百八十度的轉變，所謂「內幕」如下：　　（一）據說各地來的遊客，什九錢都用得「豁」了「邊」，同時土產商家也在訴苦，看的人多，買的人少。　　（二）大家說今年西湖的船家和酒菜館黃瓜兒側得特別兇。但據個中人道來：一春所賺，僅不過了了過去的虧空，以後若於「淡月」能吾自給自足，殊成疑問。　　這兩個問題，前者說明了大部份人的「外强中乾」，後者吿訴我們市而是如何不景氣。其實豈僅杭州，整個中國社會，亦不過如是而己。　　現實迫使我們追求回憶，我眞憧憬那兩塊錢玩一天西湖，八塊錢買一石米的時代。啊，那些歲月，何時重來呢？新知識聽音的打字機  龍岡　　美國雜誌文摘轉載紐約時報一則消息云；　　在大戰期間，德國發明了一種聽聲音自己打字的機器。　　詳細的情形，現在還在美陸軍信號團（Army　Sihnal　Corps）保守秘密中。這打字機的一切，都被禁止寫述，比一工具係德國戰時少數發明中，一直爲嚴厲保持着的軍事秘密之一。　　據一些熟悉該機械者談：英在市塲上的作用，至少是速記員和打字員末日的開始。到目　　止，所有的消息僅宣示，此爲維爾林博士（Dr．Vierling）所發明。維氏亦即發明能解決高深數學問題的計算尺的發明人。　　據推測，該機的基本原　寫：特別的聲音，激起一種電力　撃，壓榨到一個適當的籲節上。機械界老練的人士云，此原理曾經爲許多人所想到，不過實際作起來發生很多困難。這麼小的房間  果　　「這麼豆腐乾大的一個擱樓，你太太怎麼從不埋怨的？」　　「她大槪已經明白，道裏連尋氣的地方都沒有了。」藝文擅　　富於極味性的評論報第十五期，今已出版。各書報攥均有出售，該期內容有：「提倡體育應該吃草」，「孔祥熙口中的孔大少爺」，「在袁雪芬的家裏」，「新封神榜」，」周佛海免死內幕」，「荒凉的永安天韻樓」，「從英子病危說到情聖洪謨」，「李顯凱自殺之謎」，「左舜生的飯碗論」，「海軍住話」，「徐悲鴻近事」，「杜魯門援希土演詞的幕後人」等二十餘篇，本期僅售一千元。　　名翻譯家耿濟之生前所譯果戈里之諷刺劇「巡按使及其他」係根據原版俄文本迻譯，譯筆極其流暢忠實。保存原作含蓄幽默而諷刺的風韻，該書由鉅鹿路一弄八號文化生活出版社出書。　　名作家靳以所著長篇小說「前夕」已由文化生活出版社出書。全書共四部，凡四十萬字，一千餘面，分裝上下兩厚冊，每部售三萬元。火  劉夢　　這次茂昌倉庫之被火，其延燒的時間及損失的鉅大，本年還是初見。堆儲在那裏的電信器材，單言裝運，據說就需時一年。這種爲推進我國電信事業的配備而毀於一旦，確是使人債慨的事。軍火庫讓他去爆炸幾日幾夜倒可以不聞不問，這樣有助國家復興建設的器材，就糊裏糊塗的被毀壞，眞太可惜了。起火不會無因，負責當局一定得查出起火的原因，才有個交代。　　鑒於歷次火災慘厲的情形，上海市民中那一個願自己的身家財產葬入火窟。　　在這沒有事的城市裏，平均每天發生火災三四次，豈非怪事？澈查與預防火災繼續發生，該是治安當局重要的課題。危城記  秦瘦鷗　　「……走！小沈，咱們找老余去！」聲到人到，長玻璃窗開處，立刻走出了一個又高又瘦的女人；挺着腰，昂着頭、跨着像男人一樣的步子，旁若無人地急步而出。隨在她後面的是透着一臉左右爲難的神氣的徐紹明；再後面是像一條被畜養着的雄狗似的小沈。　　「那末……那末，……先送二表嫂上車站去……」徐紹明偷望了老祝一眼，勉强大着胆，期期艾艾地向他太太這棵說。神氣比哭還要難看。　　「放屁！車子我要用！」女的頭也不回。　徐紹明實在沒有勇氣再頂上去了。老祝忍不住看着他笑了一笑。　　「小沈」這位女皇似的山東太太，竟像　有見到老祝一樣，把頭一扭，仍用裂帛似的聲音向後面的小沈發令：「快叫阿林把車子開出來。我們先上工礦銀行去！」　　小沈失魂落魄似的倉皇四顧，瞧徐太太的臉色不對，便急急越過徐紹明，狂奔而出。　　徐胖子以爲自己沒有事了，旋過笨重的身軀，就想往裏面走。　　「治平！」又是一聲獅吼。那女人的臉簡直扳得比鐵還硬。「不准你送！聽見沒有？要是你再去問別人借了軍子來送他們，回頭我跟你算賬！」　　站在大門裏面，冷眼旁觀的祝兆年，眞有些不敢相信自已眼前所看到的情景是眞的。那樣會做賣買，會弄手段，會對付人的徐胖子，在他太太的積威之下，竟懦怯得比一頭小兎子還不如！　　蘭得到她的堂兄的報告之後，已經也匆匆走出來了，臉色非常蒼白。　　「不用急，胡太太。天無絕人之路，他們有汽車的不肯送，我這個用腿走路的保險把你們送上車站去！」老祝開始從那條水泥舖的甬道上走進來，就站在威風　凜的徐太太的身旁，這樣高聲地向蘭說，　　涇騐吿訴蘭，祝兆年是個會用腦經的人，聽他這麼一說，心裏便鬆了不少。　　「幹嗎這樣生氣？徐太太。」老祝　不在乎地向那位虎目圓睜，緊啾着自己的徐太太問。　　那女人倒不曾料到到世界上還有如此大胆的男人。　　「我們的事用不到你管！」她習慣地呼叱着。（四一）児童相見不相識  子愷</p>

<h3>Fond Farewell from Elders of Xikou, Chairman and Madam Fly to Hangzhou, Afternoon Visit to Yu the Great's Mausoleum in Shaoxing</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 11th] Chairman Chiang and Madam arrived in Hangzhou by plane at 12:00 noon today. The first batch of his entourage arrived at Jianqiao Airport at 8:45 this morning. Before departing this morning at 10:00, Chairman Chiang and his wife first paid their respects at Madam Chiang's mother's tomb. Then, they went to Wuling School in Xikou to address the school's more than one thousand students, earnestly encouraging each student to become a good citizen. Afterwards, they bid farewell to the elders of Xikou. Chiang’s clan leader, Wenbing, and others wished Chairman Chiang and his wife good health and hoped they would return to Xikou next Qingming Festival. Chairman Chiang and his wife responded, "Good," and wished the elders good health, urging them to take care and return home. Chairman Chiang turned to hug his grandson, Aiguo, saying "Goodbye," with warmth and kindness. Then, he and his wife took their grandson, Aiming, to the airport, boarding the "Meiling" special plane to Hangzhou. Upon arrival, they took up residence at the official residence at No. 49 Yingbai Road. Accompanying Chairman Chiang were Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Yu Jishi, Director of the General Affairs Bureau Chen Xizeng, Secretaries Zhou Hongtao and Cao Shengfang, and Aide-de-Camp Shi Juemin. Chief of the Guard, Shi Zude, remained behind and did not come to Hangzhou. After Chairman Chiang and Chiang Ching-kuo and their wives rested briefly at the official residence and had lunch, they went to Shaoxing at 2:45 PM with Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie to pay their respects at Yu the Great's Mausoleum. Hearing the news of Chairman Chiang's arrival, all people in Shaoxing County were extremely excited. On the way from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing, Chairman Chiang frequently pointed out the traces of destruction left by the Japanese puppets and instructed that they be repaired. They arrived in Shaoxing at 4:45 PM, where the people of the county lined the streets to welcome them. After resting briefly at the County Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Chiang and his party went to the Yu the Great Temple to offer sacrifices. He instructed Commissioner Zheng Xiaoyin and County Magistrate Lin Ze to repair all damaged parts of the Yu the Great Temple. The descendants of Yu, the Si clan, all came to pay their respects.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 11th] This afternoon, Chairman and Madam Chiang traveled from Hangzhou to Shaoxing to visit Yu the Great's Mausoleum to sweep the tomb. They returned to Hangzhou at 6:20 PM, arriving at 7:30 PM. They will stay in Hangzhou tonight and return to Nanjing in a day or two.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 11th] Chairman Chiang arrived at the South Gate of Shaoxing at 5:00 PM this afternoon. He transferred to a motorboat and went directly to Yu the Great's Mausoleum. After resting briefly, he paid homage before Yu the Great's statue and presented a wreath. After a light refreshment, he looked around Yu the Great's Mausoleum for a moment, leaving at 6:00 PM. At about 8:00 PM, he returned to the Hangzhou Xing Yuan (temporary residence) to rest. Yu the Great's Mausoleum is located in Kuaiji Mountain in the southeast of Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province. During the Song Dynasty's Qiande period, the Yu the Great Temple was established in Kuaiji. During the Ming Dynasty's Hongwu period, people were forbidden to collect firewood. Chairman Chiang deeply respected his character and achievements and took the time to visit the mausoleum.</p>
<h3>Welcoming the Chairman on the Shores of West Lake</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Since the victory until now, for more than a year, the people of Fenghua Xikou, Chairman Chiang's hometown, have been eagerly awaiting his arrival. However, because he is responsible for the safety of the whole country and has many things to deal with, it was not until April 2nd this year that he made the journey back. He stayed in his hometown for a full nineteen days. He deeply felt the loyalty and love of the elders and younger generations in his hometown. He was delighted by this warmth. The people of Hangzhou also missed news of Chairman Chiang. Although he graciously visited in the spring of the second day after the victory, they still hoped for another opportunity to see the lofty and great Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>In the past two days, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Vice President Wei Daoming, and National Defense Committee Secretary-General Wang Chonghui have all come to Hangzhou from Nanjing for sightseeing. Mr. Chen Guofu and Mr. Chen Lifu, who went to Wuxing from Nanjing to sweep the tomb, also turned to Hangzhou. Many sensitive people in Hangzhou were speculating: "Chairman Chiang is also coming!"</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 10th, we received the news that the Dahua Hotel on the shore of West Lake had reserved rooms for the Hangzhou Municipal Government. As a result of our inquiries everywhere, we learned: "The chairman plans to come to Hangzhou, but the day of his arrival has not been decided." On the afternoon of the 10th after 5 PM, the chairman decided in Xikou to make a stop in Hangzhou. The news only reached Hangzhou at 6:00 AM on the 11th.</p>
<p>That morning, two planes carrying the entourage first took off from Ningbo Xiangshan Airport to prepare everything in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang woke up very early that day, as usual, and walked with his wife to Wuling School to address all the teachers and students. With sincerity, kindness and affection, Chairman Chiang told many teachers and students that they should be disciplined and be good citizens. The Madam also said the same. After the speech, the Chairman and his wife boarded the prepared car to the airport. Chairman Chiang and his wife waved, held their hats, nodded, and boarded the plane.</p>
<p>At nearly 12:00 noon, Chairman Chiang's plane appeared in the sky over Hangzhou. Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Provincial Party Department Zhang Qiang, Deputy Commander of the Security Zhu Mingtao, and Mayor of Hangzhou Zhou Xiangxian, were waiting anxiously for the arrival of the Chairman at the airport.</p>
<p>The plane gradually descended, gliding to a stop on the airport runway. Chairman Chiang appeared at the door of the aircraft, radiant and wearing a black Chinese jacket over a blue gown, while his wife, wearing a black cheongsam, stepped down from the plane. The Air Force Military Academy band played a ceremonial fanfare and the national anthem. Then, the Chairman nodded in return to those who welcomed him, and the Education Director of the Air Force Academy, Hu Weike, requested the Chairman to inspect the officers and soldiers. Chairman Chiang nodded in return.</p>
<p>After resting briefly in the Air Force Academy's auditorium, they boarded the prepared car to the official residence at No. 49 Yingbai Road.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, this benevolent and lofty giant, has come to Hangzhou twice. This indicates his concern for the lives of the people of Zhejiang, and his love for the beauty of these lakes and mountains. However, we in Zhejiang must think quietly! He cares so much for us, how should we repay him? (Chu Yusheng)</p>
<h3>Chairman Allocates Funds for Urgent Relief to Aid Refugees in Jiaoji and Dehui</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] Chairman Chiang is concerned about the suffering of refugees in Dehui affected by the war. He has specially ordered the allocation of 50 million yuan in circulating currency, instructing the Executive Yuan to order the Northeast Security Commander's Office and other agencies to go to Dehui to distribute the funds. It is understood that the relevant agencies have dispatched personnel carrying relief funds to Dehui, and they have organized an emergency relief fund distribution committee in the area, which completed the distribution yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chen Guofu and Others Pay Respects to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 11th] Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, and others went to the official residence on Yingbai Road at 1:00 PM on the 11th to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and talk with him. They bid farewell shortly afterwards and took the 2:00 PM train to Shanghai to return to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>National Army in Southern Shandong Strengthens Pacification Work, Fierce Fighting on Both Sides of the Subei Haitai Line</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 11th] In order to strengthen the pacification work in the rear, the National Army in Southern Shandong has recently eliminated the scattered Communists in the areas on both sides of the Linzao and Taizao branch lines. More than 2,000 Communists, fleeing eastward through Jinlingsi from north and south Tangyin, were ambushed by the National Army in Nigou on the 10th. More than a hundred were captured alive, and the remaining Communists fled eastward in disarray. They were surrounded again by the National Army in Xingjialou, 15 kilometers northeast of Taierzhuang, on the morning of the 11th and are being annihilated. Furthermore, there are no Communist troops in the vicinity of Xiji and Qicun.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] While a major battle in the mountainous areas of Southern Shandong is still brewing, it was reported on the 11th that the main Communist forces in the Yishui area consist of five columns, those in Xintai, Laiwu, and Mengyin consist of three columns, those near Feixian consist of one column, and those outside Jinan are the Tenth Column, which is a combination of the Jie Qi and Jie Eleven Divisions and the Police Seventh Brigade. In recent days, the Communists have been actively transporting weapons and ammunition to the mountainous areas from various places, while non-combatants and supplies are being transported to the Lijin and Zhanhua areas on the north bank of the Yellow River. Fearing that the National Army will land along the coast, the Communists have now established a coastal defense headquarters, with a region extending from Xinpu to Qingdao. There is no war on the Jiaoji Line, and the National Army guerrillas can reach Zhangqiu.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 11th] On the 10th, the National Army continued to launch a large-scale mopping-up operation against the remnants of the Communist forces in the Laoguanzui and Wulingji areas north of Junxian, achieving considerable gains.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 11th] After the Battle of Libao, the remnants of the Communist forces in Subei are now fleeing to both sides of the Haitai Line to harass the area. County Magistrate Ding of Taixian led the entire security force to Jiangyan to suppress them, and fierce fighting has been going on on both sides of the road for days.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 11th] The remnants of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces in northern Henan are now in a desperate situation. The remnants of their 236th and other columns fled to the area east of Tangyin and west of Neihuang on the afternoon of the 10th. Their Independent One and Independent Two Brigades and the Seventeenth Division have fled to the northwest of Tangyin. The National Army is currently tracking and pursuing them.</p>
<h3>No Progress in Receiving Dalian, Gong Xuesui Postpones Departure, Communist Army is Using Dalian as a Supply Depot</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 11th] The reception of Dalian is progressing like a snail climbing a wall, with no progress at all. Gong Xuesui was originally scheduled to come north today, but the date has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. According to sources from Shenyang who came to Beiping today, there are many difficulties in receiving Dalian: (1) The Soviet Union has notified the government that the area of Dalian to be received is limited to a narrow area west of the railway line, which is only half of the urban area of Dalian in 1936. Compared with the "Greater Dalian" urban area expanded by Japan in 1941, it is even more pitiful. Furthermore, Yaoziwo, the source of water for Dalian, has also been designated by the Soviet side as an area for the Soviet garrison. Dalian has been dismembered in this way and is no longer a city. (2) The Soviet side does not agree to the National Army's garrisoning of Dalian, and only police security teams can go there to maintain order. Furthermore, the Soviet side has repeatedly stated recently that it hopes Chinese administrative personnel will go to receive the area first. Under the situation of the Communist army controlling Dalian, unarmed administrative personnel, once they enter, may become prisoners, and there is no possibility of receiving the area. The spokesperson also pointed out that the Communist army is currently using Dalian as a supply depot for its Shandong operations and will never easily give it up. (3) Regarding Pulandian, although negotiations have been held between the Chinese and Soviet military, the Soviet representatives are of very low rank and cannot be held responsible, and the representatives are often changed, so no results have been achieved. (4) In addition to the above, there are many basic difficulties in receiving Lushun and Dalian. The Chinese and Russian texts of the Sino-Soviet Treaty differ greatly in wording. For example, the Chinese text stipulates that China and the Soviet Union each have half of the port facilities of Dalian, while the Russian text interprets it as the Soviet Union taking half first, leaving the remaining equipment to China. Among them, the boundaries of Lushun and Dalian and the methods of garrisoning Lushun have not been specified in detail. The situation of the Chinese Changchun Railway is also the same. Furthermore, the Soviet side has purchased a large amount of real estate in Dalian, which will also become a problem in the future.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 11th] There are still some problems with the Dalian issue. There is no definite date for a reply to the six conditions we have put forward to the Soviet side. The Soviet side claims that it can carry out political reception, but the obstacles have not been removed. However, preparations are still underway, and the preparations for reception by the units under the Resources Committee have been completed. It is reported that there are more than 1,000 factories in Greater Dalian.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] At the cocktail party welcoming Lee Seung-man, Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng said that it cannot be said that there are no Communist troops near Lushun and Dalian. With the strength of the National Army, it should not be a big problem to deal with the Communist troops. His words seemed to imply that in addition to military issues, this matter must also be resolved through diplomatic channels.</p>
<h3>National Funeral for Zhang Zizhong and Cai Yuanpei Approved by the Supreme National Defense Council at Its Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] At the meeting of the National Defense Council on the 11th, the number of seats that representatives of various industries should occupy in the Legislative Yuan was discussed. It was decided to maintain the decision made by the National Defense Council at that time, with professional representatives occupying 119 seats (Note: The Legislative Yuan had changed it to 56 seats during the discussion), and the case was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. After Sun Ke returns to Nanjing, the case can be submitted for deliberation. Furthermore, the Federation of Vocational Groups sent representatives Tao Guilin and others to the National Defense Council on the 11th to petition. Liang Hancao received them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Supreme National Defense Council held its 227th regular meeting in the National Government Conference Room at 9:00 AM today, chaired by member Yu Youren. More than 30 committee members attended. The following important cases were resolved: (1) The decision was made to grant Zhang Zizhong and Cai Yuanpei national funerals. Regarding requests for public funerals from various parties, it was decided to hand them over to the Executive Yuan for discretionary handling in accordance with the Public Funeral Regulations. (2) Chen Zhaoying, Inspector of Anhui and Jiangxi, and Guo Zhongkui, Inspector of Henan and Shandong, have reached the end of their terms and are to be reappointed. (3) Sun Jingya was appointed as a supervisory member of the Control Yuan. (4) The Executive Yuan submitted a police building plan to be implemented in coordination with the military reorganization plan and a pilot police officer system implementation plan for amendment and record. (5) The Executive Yuan submitted a request for clarification regarding the conflict between the Judicial Yuan's interpretation that people who concealed or purchased enemy and puppet materials from August 15, 1945, constitute the crime of stolen goods under criminal law, and the Yuan's regulation that October 1, 1945, is the date on which enemy property ceases to be transferred, and transfers after that date are invalid. It was decided to handle the case in accordance with the Judicial Yuan's interpretation. (6) The Executive Yuan's method for rewarding direct tax and commodity tax over-collection submitted by the Ministry of Finance was amended and approved.</p>
<h3>Change of Mayor of Lushun</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 11th] It is reported that there will be a change of mayor in Lushun. Sun Guiji has been appointed as the mayor by the Central Government. The order for the current mayor and county magistrate to be appointed as national senators will be issued soon.</p>

<h3>Two County Magistrates Killed in Action</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 11th] Shijiazhuang is still under fierce attack by the Communist army on the outskirts. The isolated Zhengding County is more critical than Shijiazhuang. According to people who flew from Shimen today, prices in Shijiazhuang have plummeted, and the market has been suspended. The staff of the Pinghan Railway have been completely evacuated to Shimen. Daguo Station on the Zhengtai Road fell the day before yesterday, and Huolu and Jingxing are in an isolated state. The airport in the western suburbs of Shijiazhuang was shelled by the Communist army on the night of the 10th, but it did not affect its use today.

The Shijiazhuang military authorities are determined to protect the city, so many small strongholds more than ten miles outside the city have been abandoned automatically. The south is guarded by Gaoqian, and the north is guarded by Liuxinzhuang. There are isolation trenches and earthen roads in the suburbs of the city, and there is a ring road that can be firmly defended.

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch, 11th] In order to save the remnant situation in northern Shaanxi, the Communist army in southern Shanxi has recently launched a probing offensive from the Taihang Mountain area, attempting to threaten Guanzhong. A total of 60,000 troops, including six brigades and five regiments of Chen Geng and Wang Yong's units, a unit of the New Fourth Army, a unit of the New Second Division, and local militia, are fleeing in all directions.

<h3>Improving Civil Aviation Management: Ministry of Transportation Submits to the Political Council; Air Traffic Regulations to be Reviewed and Implemented</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Resident Committee of the Political Council previously appointed Jiang Yong, Yin Shuxian, and Zheng Kuiyi to go to Shanghai to investigate the plane crash. After drafting an investigation report and proposing many improvement suggestions, it was submitted to the government for handling. It is now learned that the Ministry of Transportation has submitted to the Political Council the handling of each point in the content of the investigation report. The Ministry's handling is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the prompt formulation of aviation regulations, unification of flight navigation command, and strengthening of aircrew management, the following is noted: 1. The Aviation Law has been promulgated, and the Air Traffic Regulations, personnel testing, and equipment inspection regulations are being drafted. Once the various measures are reviewed and finalized, they will be submitted for scheduled implementation. 2. The Ministry is starting to organize the existing navigation equipment of the China and Central Aviation Companies and instruct the Civil Aviation Administration to unify command. 3. Pilots, meteorological, and telecommunications personnel are currently being strictly screened by the Civil Aviation Administration. Those found to be technically deficient or of poor character will be eliminated at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the use of military airfields by civil aviation during peacetime, the Ministry has repeatedly consulted with the Air Force Commander-in-Chief, and a solution is expected in the short term.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the increase of meteorological observation instruments, the addition of meteorological stations and observers, the Central Meteorological Bureau has been approved to be transferred to the Ministry. This year, the Ministry plans to actively construct various meteorological facilities on the important north-south and east-west air routes in the country, add various necessary equipment, and hire experienced technicians to enrich the resources, expanding to other secondary routes as financial resources allow.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the modification of airfields and attention to adding and lengthening runways, the Ministry has established a Construction Engineering Office at Shanghai Longhua International Airport. The initial project is to reconstruct the runway to accommodate the landing of new-style giant aircraft. This project has already begun and is expected to be completed before the end of June this year. In addition, Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, Wuchang Xujiapeng Airport (i.e., Hankou Airport), and Jiujiang Shilipu Airport are also planned to be expanded this year in order to meet actual needs.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the thorough cooperation and mutual assistance between the China and Central Aviation Companies to develop the civil aviation industry, the important navigation equipment of the two companies, such as radio stations, will be managed centrally by the Civil Aviation Administration for unified command. Before the Administration officially takes over, the radio stations of the two companies in various places will be ordered to open and be used jointly to facilitate navigation. As for airfield facilities, they will also be supervised to be used jointly within a possible range to enhance the purpose of mutual assistance and cooperation.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding strengthening the inspection of aircraft performance and the prohibition of using aircraft beyond their service life, the Ministry has stipulated the inspection time and service life of aircraft and engines to ensure flight safety.</p>
<p>(7) Regarding the suspension of flights in adverse weather conditions, the Ministry has considered the conditions in various places and raised the meteorological airworthiness standards, ordering compliance. From now on, aircraft on each route will suspend flights when the weather does not meet the prescribed standards to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>(8) Regarding the transportation and burial of deceased passengers, in the past, all deceased passengers in plane crashes, except those whose origin was too inconvenient to reach, have been transported back to their hometowns for burial. The transportation of the remains of passengers killed in this incident has been supervised by the two companies to handle properly, taking into account the circumstances.</p>
<p>(9) Regarding the rectification of the China Aviation Company and the severe punishment of personnel involved in previous accidents, the American director of the company's flight operations group has been replaced, and other personnel in various departments</p>
<p>(10) Regarding the revision of compensation for plane crashes, equal regulations should be made for compensation for all aircrew and passengers. Aviation passengers in the UK and the US have automatic insurance, and compensation can be made in case of accidents. In the past, in order to take into account the possibility of aircraft accidents and to provide compensation for the families of passengers, the Ministry formulated a "Provisional Measures for Compensation for Aircraft Accidents by Aviation Companies," stipulating that aviation companies should compensate for deaths, injuries, disappearances, or loss of luggage of passengers. However, this is a temporary measure for the transitional period. It is now planned to refer to the methods of the UK and the US and negotiate with insurance companies to create accidental insurance for air passengers. We are currently consulting with various insurance companies, and trial implementation will begin once the methods are agreed upon.</p>
<p>(11) Regarding the management of foreign civil aviation aircraft flying in our country's airspace by the Civil Aviation Administration, the Civil Aviation Administration has stationed personnel in international airports such as Shanghai and Guangzhou to be responsible for handling the entry and transit of foreign civil aviation aircraft. As for foreign aircraft entering and taking off at military airfields, the Ministry has always consulted with the Air Force Headquarters to handle the matter. (News of the meeting of the Resident Committee of the Political Council can be found on the second page.)</p>

It was resolved that the motion be sent to the government for prompt handling.</p>
<h3>US to Make New Proposal on Japanese Reparations; Reportedly China May Receive 45%; Two Key Headquarters Officials Have Arrived in Washington</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] According to reliable sources from the Far Eastern Commission today: The new US proposal on Japanese reparations will stipulate that China and the United States should obtain 75% of all domestic Japanese materials available for reparations, of which the United States will take 30% and China will receive approximately 45%. The UK, Soviet Union, France, Australia, the Netherlands, India, the Philippines, New Zealand, and Canada will share the remaining 25%. The temporary reparations previously authorized and allocated by General MacArthur will be included in the aforementioned percentages.</p>
<p>The UK and the Soviet Union will object to the US allocation of too much to China, but US experts believe that China has fought Japan for a longer time among the Allied nations and has suffered the deepest Japanese devastation, so it should receive the most reparations. Unless there are completely unexpected obstacles, the United States will submit this new proposal to the Reparations Committee of the Far Eastern Commission on the 14th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Allied headquarters officials here today expressed surprise at the United Press report from Washington that the United States plans to submit the final Japanese reparations plan to the Far Eastern Commission on the 14th. However, they hope that the arrival of the two representatives from the Allied headquarters in Washington will speed up the resolution of Japanese reparations. They pointed out that the Allied headquarters did not send the director of the Economic and Scientific Section, Dangdai, and Ross to Washington, but Washington summoned Lei Luo and others back to Washington for consultation. US officials here said: Regarding the news that the final Japanese reparations plan will be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission next week, the recall of Lei Luo and others to Washington may be related to this development, but it is earlier than expected.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] The issue of Japanese reparations is now progressing toward a showdown, which is becoming increasingly clear today, as key officials handling reparations under MacArthur have arrived in Washington to discuss the policy with the authorities.</p>

<h3>Our Excellent Plan for the First Batch of Japanese Reparations Materials; Dismantling and Shipping to Begin in One or Two Months; Project Can Be Completed by Year-End</h3>
<p>Yun Zhen Speaks</p>
<p>[This City News] Zi Yuan, the representative of the Resources Committee stationed in the United States, is scheduled to take a ship to the United States next Tuesday on official business. Zi Yuan was originally the chief representative of our government's five-member reparations team stationed in Japan. Recently, due to the heavy workload, he was unable to handle both positions and his resignation was approved. Yesterday, reporters visited to inquire about the situation of Japanese reparations to China. He reported that 15% of the total amount of Japanese reparations materials is allocated to China. The first batch of 400,000 tons is expected to begin dismantling and shipping within one or two months and is estimated to be transported by the end of this year. The transportation work is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation. The total freight and preparation costs from Japanese ports to Chinese ports are approximately 30 billion, and the rumored cost of several hundred billion includes construction costs. The largest part of the first batch of reparations materials is steel plants, followed by power plants and shipyards. In addition, there are tens of thousands of machine tools and tool factories. The handling of reparations materials is as follows: steel parts are allocated to Anshan and North China Steel Companies, shipbuilding parts are allocated to Shanghai Central Shipbuilding Company, power parts are allocated to Northeast Electric Power Bureau, Jibei Electric Power Company, Capital Power Plant, and power plants in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Changsha. Machine tool factories are moved to Ma'anshan and allocated to Xiangtan Central Electrical Factory. Machine tools are allocated to the Ministry of National Defense and urgently needed institutions such as national schools and coal mines. Private enterprises can also obtain a portion. Zi said that the government has detailed and perfect preparations for the transportation, allocation, construction, and required expenses of the first batch of reparations materials. The arrival of these materials will be of great benefit to the reconstruction of China's industry, but the power sector is still insufficient.</p>

<h3>Nantung's Efforts at Reconstruction</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>"Surging Yangtze River, majestic Zilang Mountain, numerous schools, and flourishing industry and commerce." This is a rough outline of Nantung's scenery.</p>
<p>Nantung enjoyed a great reputation in the past and was once praised as a model county, but it suffered eight years of devastation by the enemy and puppet regimes, resulting in a completely changed appearance and a state of near bankruptcy. Since the victory, although efforts have been made to revive it, it has ultimately been limited by manpower and material resources, making it difficult to restore its former glory in a short period.</p>
<p>Fifty Years of Arduous Management: A Model for Local Construction</p>
<p>Nantung's various undertakings, if compared separately with other places, do not seem to have anything special. The reason why it has won the name of a model county is that each construction project has an overall plan and a consistent spirit. Fifty years of arduous management coincide with today's national construction policies. For example, the current government's advocacy of increasing production, rural industrialization, cultivating technical talents, and training teachers all have concrete and micro-scale examples in Nantung. This is where its importance lies. It is worth recalling that Nantung gentry Zhang Jian (Jizhi) engaged in local construction fifty years ago, and his motivation was to save the country and survive. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, he strongly advocated enriching the country through industry and enlightening the people through education. At that time, his ideas were not widely accepted, so he resigned and returned to his hometown, seeking to establish a model in the locality. He first founded the Dasheng Yarn Factory. Two years later, with the profits from the yarn factory, he established Tongzhou Normal School, with attached departments of agriculture, engineering, surveying, and mapping. This was the predecessor of Nantung College. Furthermore, due to a shortage of textile raw materials, he reclaimed land along the coast of northern Jiangsu and promoted cotton planting. Around the tenth year of the Republic of China, various undertakings flourished, but due to the excessive scope and the inability of political and economic conditions to cooperate, it was burdened by debt and nearly came to a standstill. From an economic point of view, Nantung's undertakings had their failures at the time, but from the perspective of the entire country and society, it cannot be said that they were not quite successful. It contributed greatly to increasing production, cultivating teachers, and technical talents, and making significant contributions to the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Education and Textiles Gradually Recovering; Salt Reclamation Still Stalled</p>
<p>Nantung's local undertakings can be divided into three major sectors: education, textiles, and salt reclamation. Other industries such as flour, oil, iron, transportation, warehousing, and charitable undertakings are closely linked to these three departments. During this visit of the reporter group to northern Jiangsu, they passed through Tongyi and met with Zhang Jingli, the general manager of Dasheng Yarn Factory, and visited all the business institutions. I deeply feel that northern Jiangsu has been in a state of war and chaos for the past ten years, and Nantung alone can be the first to recover. It still adheres to the consistent spirit of the past and carries out systematic and gradual reconstruction, which is truly rare and valuable. According to Zhang, at present, in Nantung, the work of education and textiles has been actively developed, but unfortunately, the salt reclamation area has not yet been fully established, and everything is still at a standstill, which has a profound and significant impact on the entire rural economy of northern Jiangsu. In short, all of Nantung's undertakings are a "complete set" of planned organization. Taking education as an example, the agricultural science department of Nantung College focused on cotton cultivation in the past, especially on cotton seed improvement to meet needs. This is different from the nature of general agricultural science departments. The textile department, in particular, is a special feature, as most of the textile technicians in the country today are derived from it. As for the medical department, it focuses on the training of rural doctors, so most of the graduates serve in the inland or the army. Tongzhou Normal School was completely destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War, with not a single tile left, but because the school is the mother of education in Tongyi, it was decided to restore it first. Recently, 800,000 yuan has been used as construction funds. When the reporter went to visit, the base had been completed and steel frames were being erected. It is expected to be completed in half a year, and enrollment can begin during the summer vacation. The Girls' Normal School has been gradually restored because it suffered less damage. According to statistics, the entire school now has five grades of high school normal classes, ten grades of junior high school, and 798 students.</p>
<p>Nantung Hospital was well-equipped before the war. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, it was ordered to move inland with the army, and all the equipment was destroyed. It has now applied to the government to hand over the enemy-remained Jiangbei Hospital to Nantung College as an affiliated hospital. At present, 90% of the medical work is to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. Because it is entirely voluntary, it has a significant impact on the hospital's reconstruction.</p>
<p>Regarding the Dasheng Textile Factory, it is divided into the first factory, the deputy factory, and the third factory, with a total of 140,000 spindles and 1,500 looms. Before the war, it produced 120,000 bales of yarn and more than one million bolts of cloth annually, using 500,000 dan of cotton. During the Anti-Japanese War, it suffered heavy losses, so the output decreased significantly after the victory. After efforts to restore it, the recent output has reached 80% of the pre-war level. According to the original plan, the entire northern Jiangsu area will have 500,000 spindles. If the environment is favorable in the future, it will not be difficult to gradually realize it. Moreover, farmers in Nantung have traditionally engaged in weaving as a side business. Before the war, sales to Northeast China, Sichuan, and other places reached more than 10 million bolts, but the products were all handmade wooden looms. Therefore, engineers are currently conducting investigations and research to assist farmers in improving them, reducing costs, and improving quality to enrich the rural economy. The next step in the plan is to link the three processes of textile bleaching, dyeing, and finishing into one, and prepare to establish a dyeing factory, which is expected to be completed next year, with a daily capacity of bleaching and dyeing 4,000 bolts of cloth.</p>
<p>The driving force of Nantung's industry is entirely supplied by the power plant in Tianshenggang, which currently has a power of 5,700 kilowatts. When the new machine arrives next year, it can be increased to 12,000 kilowatts. At the same time, there are plans to complete 30,000 kilowatts of power to supply the needs of Tongruhai.</p>
<p>In addition, northern Jiangsu also has a vast source of wealth, which is the salt reclamation area. The opening of salt reclamation in northern Jiangsu began in the 27th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty. At first, Zhang Qian founded the Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company in Lvsi Chang, Nantung. In the third year of the Republic of China, he founded the Dayou Jin Company, selecting higher silt beaches on the coast to build seawalls for planning and reclamation. After ten years of implementation, great results were achieved. The barren land of the past was transformed into an area with interconnected fields and houses facing each other. As a result, various salt reclamation companies were established one after another. From south to north, the area under their jurisdiction totaled more than 3 million mu, with about half of the land having been cultivated. Nearly 200,000 farmers directly depended on it for their livelihoods, and countless others indirectly benefited. The annual output of seed cotton was 2 million dan, with the improved cotton seeds of Dazhongji, Sanyu, and other towns being the most effective, making a significant contribution to textile raw materials. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the situation, the rural areas have been declining, and the work of restoration brooks no delay. It is generally believed that future development must achieve the following: (1) Ensure rural security, so that everything can be promoted in an orderly manner. (2) Provide emergency agricultural loans and request the Farmers Bank of China to provide low-interest loans to alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu farmers. (3) Repair dikes, sluices, and rivers. (4) Open a new canal from Nantung to Lianshui, with a total length of 250 kilometers. Currently, if work is used as a substitute for relief, mobilizing 80,000 refugees to work will require 390,000 dan of wheat, which can be completed in four months. (5) Open 24 diversion rivers to guide water into the sea, and at the same time build dikes and gates to regulate the water volume.</p>
<p>Finally, according to Zhang Jingli, the above plan is based on 40 to 50 years of experience. I firmly believe that it is quite certain to build northern Jiangsu into a cotton textile industry center, because Nantung's construction already has a foundation.</p>
<h3>The Claim of Doubling the Repayment of Public Bonds Is Inaccurate; It Cannot Be Equated with Private Debt</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] A certain senior official of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance said: The claim of doubling the repayment of public bonds is purely speculation. From the standpoint of public debt management, the government should abide by the original rules and repay the principal and interest on schedule to maintain national credibility. As for doubling the repayment due to currency depreciation, this would not only increase the government's budget, but also be unfair to the holders of public bonds that have already been repaid, because it cannot be equated with private debt and bank deposits. Currently, the government has not yet repaid six or seven types of public bonds issued before the war, such as the Unified Public Bonds and Reconstruction Public Bonds, and more than ten items issued during the war, such as the National Defense Construction Public Bonds, all of which are being drawn and repaid on schedule in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Fire Prevention Is the Responsibility of the People</h3>
<p>Life in an urban society requires safety and stability. But in today's Shanghai, the threat that citizens' lives and property and the materials and equipment of industry and commerce are most vulnerable to is the attack of fire. For the passive prevention of fire, the municipal administration has a fire administration department, with the task of preventing and extinguishing fires, thereby preserving the lives and property of citizens. Shanghai is known as a metropolis of the East, and is in fact the first city in China, with prosperous industry and commerce and a dense population; and the corruption of municipal administration, the inadequacy of construction, the fragmentation of fire administration, and the lack of moral concepts and sense of responsibility of the general public are also well-known. Now is the turn of spring and summer, and the climate will be hot in an instant. If we do not actively plan for fire prevention, then the lives and property of citizens can feel threatened at any time, which is indeed an important issue for Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, Shanghai has experienced repeated fire alarms and frequent disasters. The great fire on Wuding Road lasted for thirteen hours, and the houses and properties of half a road, and the hard work of the victims for many years, were all reduced to ashes and difficult to recover. This disaster is a major test for fire administration. In theory, in the midst of public outcry, we should actively seek improvement and progress. Also, the pain of this disaster, in theory, the general public should have a cautious mentality to reduce or eliminate the causes of fire. However, according to statistics: in January this year, there were a total of 88 fire alarms in Shanghai; in February, it decreased to 113 times; in March, it increased to 154 times; from April 1st to 10th, it has reached 51 times; with an average of three fire alarms a day, and the disasters are unprecedented. Judging from the situation of fire alarms frequently reported in the past ten days, the number of fires this month may surpass the figures for March. Looking at the severity of the fire alarms and disasters each month, it is truly chilling and frightening, especially the great fire at the Maochang Warehouse on Nanxun Road on the 9th, which burned for nearly thirty hours or more. A large number of relief supplies from the Executive Yuan were burned to ashes, and the total amount of losses is no longer quantifiable; its disaster exceeded that of Wuding Road and has undoubtedly constituted an unprecedented major fire in Shanghai. The situation is so serious that it has only been seen in Shanghai in the past ten years. And the future is long, and fortune and misfortune are unpredictable. We must learn from the past and be cautious of the future, and we must issue an urgent call of "beware of fire" to the municipal authorities and the citizens.</p>
<p>"Beware of fire" is everyone's responsibility; it is not entirely the responsibility of the government, nor is it entirely the responsibility of the people. Therefore, the government must "beware of fire" in administrative measures: citizens must "beware of fire" in their lives and residences. In the past case of the great fire on Wuding Road, the public angrily criticized the corruption of firefighters, which had some reason, and most of the good firefighters felt ashamed of their reputation, but fortunately Mayor Wu was able to comfort them, and the firefighters became more vigilant and worked harder. In the past few months, fire alarms have been frequent, and firefighters in various districts have been rushing around. Under poor material conditions, they have shown even greater effort, and their spirit of service is truly admirable. Examining the causes of hundreds of fire alarms in recent months, especially the great fire at the Maochang Warehouse, half of the blame also lies in the lack of rigor in the daily lives of citizens and the negligence in the management of industrial and commercial institutions, resulting in continuous disasters. For this reason, today "beware of fire" is everyone's responsibility, and everyone must be vigilant and strive hard to make it effective.</p>
<p>The municipal authorities should seek the way to "beware of fire" in administrative measures, and should actively engage in fire prevention, focusing on the causes of fire alarms in recent days. First, since Shanghai has been through eight years of war, most of the electrical materials and equipment in public and private buildings are old, and electrical leakage occurs easily when they are wet, so electrical wiring inspections and safety inspections of electrical equipment in companies, firms, and homes should be carried out quickly. Second, the major cause of fires in recent days has been flammable liquids, some caused by cooking, some by storing flammable materials, especially the use of kerosene for cooking, which is more prone to fire than gasoline, and should be rationally restricted and banned. According to the statistics for March, of the 154 fires, Hongkou and Yangshupu accounted for 46, mostly caused by cooking with flammable liquids. For the sake of the lives and property of the general public, it is imperative to restrict and ban them. Third, Shanghai has a dense population, and most of them are not needed by the production sector. From the perspective of social and economic policy, we should seek to disperse the population to avoid the concentration of population in urban areas, and it is also necessary to restrict the influx of population. However, the most important thing at present is to ban mezzanines, relocate shantytowns, and stop all kinds of construction that is not conducive to fire protection. The above are just the general points. The general lack of efficiency in municipal administration, the Public Works Bureau, the Police Bureau, and the Fire Department are all related to direct and indirect fire protection. Passive fire protection, such as improving fire-fighting equipment, can strengthen the extinguishing of fires in tangible ways, but active fire protection, such as seeking perfection, can actively prevent fires in intangible ways. This is the way to "beware of fire" in administration.</p>
<p>The way for citizens to "beware of fire" is to first establish a moral concept in their minds, and to be cautious at all times and in all places in their actions. According to statistics in recent months, of the hundreds of fires, the most were caused by fires in homes, resulting in major disasters. Some were caused by cooking fires, some by using electric heating fires, some by chimney fires, and even some by worshipping gods and Buddhas, which shows that the lack of caution in family life is a major cause of fires. As for companies, firms, or institutions, they should strengthen management and improve efficiency: fire prevention equipment must be complete and kept in an applicable state at all times to avoid temporary failure. All fuels, chemical materials, and other equipment that are sufficient to ignite fire should be stored safely. The fire at the China Merchants Bureau's first wharf last month was rumored to have been caused by the ignition of stored "over-oxidized sodium," which shows that disasters can occur at any time if management is negligent.</p>
<p>According to reports yesterday, it has been discovered in this city that there is a "fire-setting team" organized by the Communist Party, using children in an attempt to cause disasters. The toxicity of their intentions is truly hateful. The security authorities of this city should pay close attention to such harmful acts at all times; that is, every citizen should also assist and strictly prevent them. We must not allow useful materials to be turned into ashes, and the lives and property of citizens to be damaged. Everyone must rise up and take responsibility for fire prevention!</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Have Agreed to France's Request: The Saar Region Should Return to French Rule; However, They Oppose the Separation of the Ruhr Region from Germany; The Soviet Union Intends to Oppose China as a Convening Country for the German Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] The United States and Britain today agreed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference to France's request to cede the 738-square-mile Saar region and its 863,000 inhabitants (mostly Germans) from Germany to France for separate rule. US Secretary of State Marshall also suggested that the Foreign Ministers' Conference take initial steps to implement this matter. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is scheduled to issue a statement tomorrow. As for France's request to separate the Ruhr industrial region from Germany, Marshall and British Foreign Minister Bevin both expressed their opposition. Marshall also opposed the establishment of a special administrative organization in the Ruhr and the international sharing or joint management of the region's industrial resources. France's request was made by Foreign Minister Bidault, who also requested that the Rhineland be allowed to be independent, but was rejected by Bevin. Bidault declared that ownership of the Ruhr's coal mines and smelters should be transferred to "countries that have attacked Germany," and that a special administrative organization for the Ruhr should be established under the "protection" of the UN Security Council, and that "considerable military force" should be permanently stationed in the Rhineland to prevent future German aggression. Molotov did not comment on this. Bevin said that the safest guarantee to prevent Germany was the Four-Power Pact proposed by the United States. Marshall then returned to the issue of revising the German-Polish border, hoping that the Allied countries would not adopt a border backed by force. It is said that this kind of border cannot serve as a good foundation for peace. At the same time, a spokesman for the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated that the current western border is final and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 10th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference decided today to ask the Foreign Ministers' Conference to extend for two days to complete the report on the procedures for initiating the German peace treaty. According to this report, it was originally scheduled to be completed today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] At the meeting of the four Deputy Foreign Ministers this morning, the Soviet representative opposed a proposal for China to be one of the convening countries of the German peace conference. On the contrary, Britain and the United States insisted that China should be one of the convening countries. At the same time, the date, location, and organization of the meeting should be immediately submitted to the Chinese government for approval.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] According to a hint by US Secretary of State Marshall two days ago, he will not leave Moscow before the end of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, nor will he ask for the conference to be extended. Secretary Marshall earnestly hopes that the agenda will be discussed completely, and he will not hesitate to re-examine the discussion of various issues in order to reach a final agreement.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] At the meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers this morning, British Foreign Minister Bevin agreed to the proposal that the German peace treaty should be signed by the German central government.</p>
<h3>Reaching an Agreement on the German Peace Treaty Is the Only Hope for Peace</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 10th] General Clay, the commander-in-chief of the US occupation forces in Germany, held a press conference today. German reporters were allowed to ask questions for the first time. When asked about the future of the German central government, General Clay said: The powers of the German central government must be strictly stipulated and must be subject to the powers of the states. Then the United States will agree to the establishment of a German central government. I still believe that the four powers may reach an agreement on the future of Germany, which is the only hope for peace. The German issue is the most difficult problem to solve after the war. Speaking of the recent coal mine strike in the Ruhr region, only the German people are affected by it. As for the recent statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who vigorously stated that the reparations obtained by the Soviet Union were less than those of Britain and the United States, this statement is unreliable. Because the Soviet Union did not submit a report to the Allied Control Council for Germany, almost no one can know the exact amount of reparations obtained by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Trade Negotiations About to Commence: Delegation Departs for Home</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 11th] The delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which visited Britain as guests of the British Parliament, has completed its four-week visit and departed for home today.

<h3>British-Soviet Trade Negotiations: About to Unfold in the Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>Fengfeng Court Resigns: New Cabinet Is Being Organized</h3>
<p>[United Press, Finnish Capital, 11th] President Sikiv immediately ordered Prime Minister Pejala to continue to handle government affairs until the new cabinet is formed.

The news is now being organized.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle's Second Speech: French Cabinet Does Not Pay Attention to It</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] Regarding General de Gaulle's second speech, the major French political parties have adopted a firm stance, but the government has remained completely silent. According to Prime Minister Ramadier, De Gaulle's speech has not changed the views of the French cabinet in any way. The opinions he has recently expressed have not created a new situation that requires a cabinet meeting to discuss.</p>
<h3>Marshall Sends a Letter to Molotov: Condemning the Soviet Union's Policy Toward Korea: Advocating That the US-Soviet Joint Committee Should Be Reconvened Immediately</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 11th] US Secretary of State Marshall today condemned the Soviet Union for creating serious economic difficulties in Korea and for causing the failure of the Allied policy in Korea. He proposed convening a conference between the United States and the Soviet Union this summer to review the Allied policy in Korea. Marshall sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, requesting that the two governments instruct the US and Soviet military commanders in Korea to immediately reconvene the US-Soviet Joint Committee, which has been suspended in Korea for a long time. He requested: According to the terms of the 1945 Moscow Agreement, "based on the democratic rights of respecting freedom of speech," the two of them are responsible for immediately resuming their work. Marshall also warned: The United States believes that there is no other way to follow besides this, and hopes that this step will be taken immediately in the US-occupied area of Korea without further delay, in order to promote the objectives stipulated in the Moscow Agreement and establish a temporary Korean government as a preliminary step towards Korean independence.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan: Intense Debate Unfolds in the Security Council; Greek Representative Also Attends to Present Views</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 10th] U.S. Representative Austin defended President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey. Austin denied Soviet Representative Gromyko's claim that the move interfered in Greek internal affairs, stating that Greece and Turkey had directly requested U.S. aid and that it was in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Austin requested that the Security Council postpone discussion of the situation in Turkey because the U.S. aid plan was still being debated in Congress, and the U.S. itself did not know what approach it would take.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th] The Greek representative to the United Nations, and current ambassador to the U.S., Dendramis, directly criticized neighboring countries to the north of Greece for attempting to fraudulently sell communist dictatorship to the Greek people while debating President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey today in the Security Council, and he supported the U.S.' request for the United Nations to endorse Truman's plan. Dendramis stated, "The reason Greece is constantly experiencing disputes is entirely due to the assistance given to a minority of Greeks from outside Greece's northern borders. These minorities intend to force Greece to adopt a communist dictatorship by coercive means." Earlier, Polish Representative Lange challenged U.S. Representative Austin, urging him to publicly declare within the United Nations organization whether the "totalitarian" threat that makes the Truman plan necessary is the Soviet Union. Austin ignored this, but Greek Representative Dendramis did not. Dendramis emphasized that the United States is the only country that can provide effective assistance to the suffering people of Greece and opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to organize a special committee of the Security Council to handle any matters related to aid to Greece.</p>
<h3>U.S. Has Signed Aviation Rights Agreements with Fifteen Countries; Most Involve Surplus Goods as Exchange Conditions</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 10th] The Foreign Liquidation Commission announced today that the U.S. has completed aviation rights agreements with fifteen countries. These agreements include the disposition of surplus goods overseas. As a result, U.S. airlines now have the right to fly on routes within these countries, use navigation equipment, communication tools, weather reports, and airport facilities around the world. Most of the aid shipped by the U.S. to other countries consists of surplus goods, which, in most cases, serve as exchange conditions for the U.S. to obtain flying rights. Some air stations are currently managed by U.S. airline personnel, who are also training technicians locally for application. It is understood that these agreements include China.</p>
<h3>U.S. Telephone Labor Strike: No Hope for Resolution in Sight</h3>
<p>New Jersey Workers Refuse to Return to Work</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] U.S. telephone industry strike leaders rejected the compromise solution proposed by management to the main long-distance telephone union, dimming hopes tonight for a quick resolution to the four-day-old nationwide telephone strike. Communications Workers of America President Beirne stated that the company's proposal was unsatisfactory, but he would keep the door open for continued negotiations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] New Jersey Governor Driscoll issued an order yesterday prohibiting the strike, stating that telephone workers would be fined or imprisoned if they did not return to work by 4 p.m. today. The executive committee of the U.S. telephone union ordered telephone workers in the state to refuse to return to work, denouncing the order as not only unconstitutional but also fascist.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan Unanimously Passed by Senate; Vandenberg Amendment</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] The Senate today unanimously passed the amendment proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, clearing the first major obstacle for President Truman's proposal to provide $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey. According to the amendment, if a majority of the Security Council (where the veto power does not apply) or a majority of the General Assembly believes that aid to Greece and Turkey is unnecessary or should no longer be provided, the United Nations has the right to halt U.S. aid efforts at any time. President Truman also has the right to stop aid efforts at will or at the direct request of Greece or Turkey. The Senate also unanimously passed another amendment requiring that the administrator of the plan appointed by Truman be subject to the approval of the House of Representatives, and that U.S. funds not be used to repay Greek or Turkish foreign debt. The Senate's sudden acceleration of action today was due to Republican Senator Taft's first full support for Truman's plan to contain communism in the Middle East. Democratic Senator Connally strongly denounced the Soviet Union as an aggressor, while Democratic Senator Pepper argued that the U.S. was abandoning the policies of the late President Roosevelt and engaging in an "undeclared war" against the Soviet Union. While the two were engaged in a heated debate, Taft stated that he would vote in favor of President Truman's plan, as otherwise, "We will be seen by the Soviet Union as the end of American prestige." Taft also stated that he did not believe the plan set a precedent for similar aid to other countries. Observers believe that the unanimous passage of the Vandenberg amendment can be interpreted as an indication that the entire aid plan will also receive overwhelming support when it is put to a final vote at the end of this week or the beginning of next week.</p>

The second part includes sanctions and the veto power. Soviet Representative Gromyko objected beforehand.

No discussion can be fruitful without starting from this point.</p>

<h3>Draft Housing Lease Regulations: Preliminary Amendments Made by the Senate; Drafted Yesterday in a Joint Meeting of Three Committees; Will Be Sent to the Legislative Yuan After Soliciting Opinions from All Senators</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the victory of the War of Resistance, housing lease disputes in this city have never ceased, and both landlords and tenants have been troubled by this issue. Recently, the Economic, Land Law, and Civil Law committees of the Legislative Yuan were ordered to complete the draft of the Housing Lease Regulations and submitted it to the municipal government for endorsement. The municipal government then sent the case to the Municipal Senate for discussion. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the council specially convened a joint meeting of the Land Administration, Regulations, and Social Affairs committees, and representatives from the Land Administration and Social Affairs Bureaus were invited to attend. Approximately 30 people attended, chaired by Wu Zhengzhuan. After about three hours of discussion, the draft regulations were revised again. It was also decided to distribute this revised draft to all senators within the week to solicit opinions and then send it to the Legislative Yuan for reference and deliberation.</p>
<h3>The Draft Housing Lease Regulations, as Preliminarily Amended Yesterday by the Joint Meeting of the Municipal Senate, are as follows:</h3>
<p>Article 1: These regulations shall apply to housing lessors in the capital cities of provinces and municipalities and other densely populated areas where renting is difficult, as designated by the provincial government.

<p>Surplus Housing Must Be Leased</p>

<p>Rent May Be Requested to Be Modified</p>

The same applies if the lease term is not fixed.

(2) Provisions that violate the preceding paragraph and are unfavorable to the lessee shall be invalid. (New addition)</p>
<p>There is also a temporary motion regarding the standard for housing rent, which was not concluded due to time constraints. It was then resolved that the secretariat of the Senate shall notify the members of the three committees to divide the housing in the four districts of the city, east, west, north, and south, into three grades, A, B, and C, and examine their pre-war and current rents for reference.</p>
<h3>"Termination of Lease Upon Expiration" Conflicts with Resolution of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>Senator Zhang Expresses Opinion</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter inquired about Municipal Senator Zhang Yiqu's opinion on the Legislative Yuan's draft Housing Lease Regulations. According to him: Recently, the housing shortage in this city has become increasingly serious. The Housing Lease Regulations should be drafted more meticulously. I once proposed at the first general assembly of the Municipal Senate that the original lessee should have the right to continue leasing, which was passed by the general assembly. Upon checking the Legislative Yuan's draft Housing Lease Regulations, Article 9 (now Article 10 as revised by the Senate) stipulates that "if the agreed lease term has expired," the lessor may terminate the contract, which completely contradicts the general assembly's resolution that "the original lessee has the right to continue leasing." Article 9 (now Article 10 as revised by the Senate), Paragraph 6, of the draft should be revised to read "if the agreed lease term has expired and the original lessee does not need to renew the lease" to be appropriate. Otherwise, the lessee will never have a day of peaceful and happy life. Because the agreed lease term for housing in this city recently is generally one year, and as short as six months or three months. If the contract must be terminated upon the expiration of the agreed lease term and not renewed, then the entire city of Shanghai will be in turmoil all day long, which is bound to cause a catastrophic universal dispute, the danger of which is extremely great, and so on.</p>
<h3>Huge Corruption Case of Theft and Sale at the United Logistics Department Clothing Factory; Attempt to Bribe 500 Million Yuan to Erase Traces; All Perpetrators Have Been Detained; Three Absconding Merchants Have Been Arrested</h3>
<p>It is reported that several important personnel in a certain clothing factory established in Shanghai by the Production Department of the Logistics Department of the United Logistics Headquarters are suspected of continuously stealing and selling large amounts of cloth and replacing better-quality cloth with inferior cloth. After being reported to the Ministry of National Defense, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng secretly dispatched a major general from the Supervisory Bureau to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the matter. Due to the serious nature of the case, concrete results were only obtained recently. It is heard that the personnel of the clothing factory once attempted to bribe the personnel in charge of the case with 500 million yuan to erase traces, but were rejected. They then attempted to bribe the major general alone with 20 million yuan. The major general believed that the bribery was sufficient evidence of the corruption case and, after confirmation by a third party, accepted the first batch of 5 million yuan, with the remainder promised to be paid in installments. As the case developed to the stage of action, Peng Weiren, Director of the Supervisory Bureau, and Zhang Xian, Director of the Military Law Department, personally came to Shanghai to execute the operation. After consulting with relevant parties in the city, all the perpetrators of the clothing factory's corruption were detained, and three merchants suspected of colluding with the clothing factory in corruption were arrested the day before yesterday. However, it is learned that the mastermind of the case has fled upon hearing the news and will continue to be arrested and brought to justice. It is heard that the perpetrators will be transferred to Beijing for interrogation by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense.</p>

<h3>Third Petition by the Book Industry: Requesting Complete Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>The issue of exempting the book industry from business tax has not yet been resolved.

<h3>Tongji Students Petition Again; Port Headquarters to Respond Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The strike at Tongji University remained deadlocked yesterday. Yesterday, the student union of the school told reporters during a reception at the Faculty of Arts that all students expressed indignation at the open letter published by Company Commander Wang in various newspapers the other day. In particular, they believed that the two points mentioned in the letter, that students beat soldiers and that no students were injured, deliberately distorted the facts and reversed right and wrong.</p>
<p>Representatives of the student union of the school continued to petition the garrison headquarters and the port headquarters yesterday morning. Commander Xuan of the garrison headquarters personally received them. Commander Xuan first clarified that the powers of the garrison headquarters and the port headquarters are parallel, so he only wished to express his opinion as an intermediary, stating that he hoped that Tongji students would not confuse the beating of students by soldiers and the withdrawal of troops from the campus, because the stationing of troops was by order of the state, so the withdrawal must also await the order of the state. Regarding the beating of students by soldiers, the port commander has already made an oral apology and guarantee to the president of the school, so he sincerely hoped that the students could resume classes as soon as possible. When the student representatives went to the port headquarters to petition, Director Qiu of the adjutant's office represented the headquarters in receiving them. He was unable to respond to the four demands raised by the students, but he believed that the headquarters might accept them, and he said that the port headquarters would give a formal reply to the school tomorrow (i.e., today) morning. Currently, all students at Tongji University are quietly observing the content of the reply. According to them, if the reply is not satisfactory, they will continue the strike and expand the action.</p>

<h3>Mayor Invites Industry Leaders to Discuss Curbing Price Hikes: Central Government Has Determination to Stabilize Prices; Believes Orders Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Report] This city and Nanjing have been designated by the central government as areas for strict price control. The authorities unanimously believe that Shanghai and Nanjing have a leading role in the national finance and prices, and they must fully stabilize price increases. After Mayor Wu returned from a price conference in Nanjing yesterday, he convened leaders of the local cotton yarn, rice, flour, edible oil, and other industries in the municipal government conference room at 4 PM to discuss practical ways to suppress prices. Shen Bo-le of the yarn industry, Dong Jiu-feng of the cotton cloth industry, Xing Zhi-gang and Gu Yi-sheng of the bean and rice industry, Pan Shi-hao of the dyeing and weaving industry, Qiu Liang-rong of the oil pressing industry, and Wang Yang-ta of the China Edible Oil Company attended. Mayor Wu reported that the central government has prepared concrete measures to stabilize the prices of four major daily necessities: cotton yarn, rice, edible oil, and flour. He believes that orders will arrive here in about a week. Before the official negotiated prices are announced, the following measures to curb price increases during the transitional period were discussed:</p>
<p>Yarn Factories Should Not Rush to Buy Cotton</p>
<p>(1) Cotton Yarn - The mayor said: The price of yarn depends on the price of cotton. If the price of cotton is stable, there is no reason for the price of yarn to rise. Before the new cotton comes on the market this year, the government will have appropriate measures. Factories should not rush to buy. Also, cotton yarn merchants' sales transactions must be registered in accordance with the regulations set by the Cotton Management Committee, otherwise the economic supervision team will arrest them.</p>
<p>Government to Dump Foreign Rice</p>
<p>(2) Rice - In order to quickly suppress the price of rice, the foreign rice controlled by the government will be dumped. The method of dumping will be discussed and decided after Vice Minister of Food Pang Song-zhou arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing tonight. According to Mayor Wu, there will be no panic in the rice supply in the Shanghai and Nanjing area. Regarding the large-scale purchase of rice from rice-producing areas, which has led to rising rice prices, the provincial government has sent personnel to Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places to investigate secretly. In addition, Mayor Wu said that he "cannot recognize, but will not interfere with" the decision of the municipal price evaluation committee that the price of white japonica rice should not exceed 140,000 per stone. He hopes that rice merchants can cooperate sincerely with the government. After Vice Minister Pang arrives in Shanghai, rice merchant representatives will be convened again to discuss good strategies.</p>
<p>Oil Price Negotiated at 350,000</p>
<p>(3) Edible Oil - Yesterday, the market price of edible oil was 400,000 yuan per dan. Mayor Wu believes that the price is too high and unreasonable. The representatives of the oil pressing industry and vegetable oil factories who attended the meeting yesterday also admitted that the price was too high and unanimously decided that it should not exceed 350,000 yuan from today. If there are black market transactions, the municipal government will strictly crack down on them. Mayor Wu said: I can only recognize this price of 350,000 as a temporary market price during the transitional period. The negotiated price that the central government may announce in a week may be lower than this number. Before the order arrives, 350,000 will be the highest price for the time being.</p>
<p>Flour to Maintain Original Price</p>
<p>(4) Flour - The Mayor said: So far, there seems to be no problem with flour, and it has been decided to maintain the original price. However, there should be close attention to any resale.</p>

<p>Nanxun Road: According to the investigation report of the Hongkou Police Bureau on the fire at the Maochang Warehouse on Nanxun Road, the time of the fire was 23:55 on the 8th. The location of the fire was the southwest part of the second floor, where the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Bureau stored telecommunications equipment. The doors and windows are usually tightly closed. The fire clearly occurred from within. Currently, Yang Shi-sheng, the warehouse manager, and three Russian volunteer police officers have been detained for investigation.

<p>Dapu Road</p>
<p>According to the investigation by the Lujiiawan Police Branch Bureau, the cause of the fire on Dapu Road at 3:11 PM on the 10th was due to a No. 36561 truck loaded with nine barrels of celluloid film.

The flames spread in an instant. The driver of the truck, Li A-da, and the worker saw that they had caused trouble and abandoned the truck and fled, causing the fire to quickly spread to No. 57 Dapu Road and continue to spread, causing a major disaster. The driver Li A-da and the worker Lin Rui-fu who smoked have been arrested and sent to the District Attorney's Office for investigation.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Medical and Health</h3>
<p>Wang Xianyi asks: When I was thirteen years old, I suffered from a foot ailment, with soreness in both knees that prevented me from moving. After applying safflower oil, I felt slightly better. In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), I suffered from typhoid fever, and walking became even more difficult. Whenever the weather turns cold, the soreness intensifies, making it impossible to take even a single step. I would like to ask: (1) What is this illness, and how can it be treated? (2) Why is there stinging pain in my urethra when urinating, and why is the urine cloudy?</p>
<p>[Answer by Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] (1) A diagnosis should be determined before treatment can be administered. Recovery may be possible. (2) It is undoubtedly urethritis. A urine test must be conducted first to determine the treatment plan.</p>
<p>(2) Chest Pain</p>
<p>Wang Xinhua asks: I have had a cough for more than half a year, suspected to be a lung ailment. Three months ago, I had an X-ray, which showed no lung disease, but the cough has not gone away. I often feel a dull ache in my chest, and there is often a large amount of phlegm blocking my throat, hindering breathing. The phlegm is white and sticky, but my weight has not decreased. My appetite is still good, and my spirits are also fine. I would like to ask, what is the exact ailment? What treatment methods are available? Is there any specific medicine? Is the chest pain a sign of lung disease? Is taking cod liver oil effective?</p>
<p>[Answer by Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] Your ailment is likely chronic bronchitis. Besides treating the symptoms, there is no special therapy or specific medicine. Chest pain could be a symptom of lung disease. Cod liver oil is beneficial and harmless, and it should be taken. It is best to use those containing Vitamins A and D.</p>

<h3>The UNESCO Will Hold the First Conference on Basic Education in China, Indicating China's Leading Position</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London Airmail] The Standing Committee of the Executive Board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), at its recent meeting held in Paris in February 1947, designated "basic education" as one of the three major programs for 1947. As for what is basic education, a spokesperson for the organization said that the term is actually a new term, which not only wants to include the concept of children's education, but also wants to include adult education. They want to show that this kind of education is not only to enable people to read, write, and calculate, but also to give them basic education, so that they can make a living and improve their economic situation, be able to express themselves, improve their health environment, be able to participate in their domestic and international government, and be able to obtain a more complete and better life. However, there is currently no word that can encompass the above purposes, so this new term was created.</p>
<p>Having a Leadership Role</p>
<p>The spokesperson said: "Several countries have successful programs in promoting basic education. The Soviet Union, Mexico, Turkey, and China are the most successful. China, encouraged by Sun Deliyi in 1911 and continuously promoted by Chairman Chiang, has continued to develop the large-scale education experience even during the War of Resistance Against Japan. This feat will forever be a glorious history of education and an epic in education." UNESCO, in view of China's leading position in the fight against illiteracy, has decided to hold its first "Regional Study Conference" in Nanjing from June 2 to 14 (Editor's note: A telegram was recently received from Beijing saying that it has been postponed to July 1). Experts from Asian and South Pacific countries and territories will attend the conference. UNESCO Director-General Julian Huxley said in a letter to our Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua on March 12: Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and Your Excellency, your country has achieved remarkable work results in basic education. Therefore, we believe that it is most appropriate for UNESCO to hold the first conference on this issue in your country. I believe that in convening this conference, China has a leading role in the most important aspects. This leadership is in line with its great tradition and its current and future position in the world.</p>
<p>Four Major Issues</p>
<p>It is reported that the Nanjing Conference will focus on the following four major issues: (1) The language problem of basic education, (2) Reading material problems, (3) The use of new technologies in literacy training, (4) Administrative and organizational aspects, including finance and personnel. In addition, UNESCO has decided to cooperate with the governments of two member states to conduct "guidance programs" in China and Haiti. UNESCO hopes that the three regional conferences to be held in Nanjing in the future will be able to develop special guidance programs that will be carried out in 1947. The results will be of the greatest value to China's basic education program. The guidance program to be carried out in China will include the following four themes: (1) Using tools that help understanding to educate illiterate adults and adolescents, (2) Using visual media to educate illiterate adults, (3) Developing simple teaching materials for educating illiterate adults on health education, economic development, and cultural development, and simple teaching materials for promoting international understanding, (4) Actively training the implementers of basic education. After the Nanjing Conference, another similar regional conference will be held in Mexico City in November, with experts from China, the United States, and South American countries participating.</p>

<p>The Sino-Foreign Exchange Limit Remains Restricted; National Banks May Approve Increases in Special Circumstances</p>
<p>The Central Trust of China Bank previously imposed strict restrictions on the amount of Sino-Foreign exchange to prevent speculative hot money from concentrating in Shanghai and affecting the financial market. Commercial banks and firms in various regions were divided into three categories with weekly exchange limits of 50 million, 40 million, and 30 million. These commercial banks and firms felt that these limits were too strict and hindered business development, and hoped that the Central Bank would relax them. It is reported that the Central Bank has considered this issue and believes that the current financial markets in various regions are very normal and that the existing quotas are sufficient to meet needs, so it has decided not to change them. However, if banks or firms have special circumstances, they can state their reasons and apply for a reasonable increase.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Soars in Unison</h3>

Other items such as foreign nails, files, and high-speed steel also followed suit.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: Tianjin Merchants Show Interest</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market saw interest only from Tianjin merchants, with slightly more inventory appearing on the market, causing asking prices to fall. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was once quoted as high as 8.9 million yuan, but due to sluggish sales, the price was lowered to 8.85 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 4.9 million yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan, while 16-count yarn saw an increase of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company sold various counts of cotton yarn as usual. 42-count Cat Butterfly yarn was priced at 7.15 million, 20-count Water Moon at 3.6 million yuan, 16-count Airplane Grass Bag at 3.2 million yuan, 32-count Abundant Harvest at 6.8 million, and 60-count Five Sons at 10.5 million yuan.

Applications were received from a total of 1,217 entities, including 833 domestic manufacturers and 384 yarn dealers.</p>
<p>National Bank Prioritizes Foreign Exchange for Purchasing Foreign Rice</p>
<p>According to Yu Ruxin, the assistant manager of the Procurement Department of the Central Trust of China, based on the limits set by the Washington International Food Council, China can purchase 200,000 tons of foreign rice in the first half of this year. The Central Trust of China is actively procuring and transporting this rice to increase domestic food reserves. In addition, 60,000 tons of Siamese and Burmese rice will be loaded onto ships at the end of this month and are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of May. The cost of foreign rice, including freight, is approximately 130,000 yuan for Burmese and Thai rice, while Annamese rice is priced at 180,000 yuan due to intentional obstruction by the French. In the future, if it is sold on the market, it will be sold at a price lower than the cost. The policy will be decided by the Executive Yuan, and the National Bank has agreed to prioritize foreign exchange for the purchase of foreign rice.</p>
<p>Seasonal Quotas for Kerosene and Tobacco Imports Modified</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee held its 28th regular meeting on the 10th. In addition to the two cases that were announced yesterday, the following items were also approved:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the seasonal quotas for kerosene and tobacco in Appendix (II), the original quota for the first quarter was set for February to April. Due to actual needs, the predetermined quotas for kerosene and tobacco for the first quarter have been changed to January to March. The quota for the second quarter is designated as April to June and will be determined separately when the second-quarter quota is established.</p>
<p>(2) When importing machinery, importers often need to import accessories. These accessories sometimes fall within Appendix (II), but the importer is not a registered importer for Appendix (II) goods, which prevents the requested accessories from being imported, rendering the main machinery ineffective. To ensure that machinery and accessories can be imported together, the committee has decided to establish a review committee for industrial machinery accessories, appointing Wu Yunchu, Yang Xiren, Li Qijun, and You Yinzhao as members, with Wu Yunchu as the convener.</p>

<p>In summary, at the beginning of the surrender, the types and tonnage of ships remaining in the Japanese army were approximately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A total of 159 naval vessels, with a total tonnage of over 388,000 tons. Except for a portion that was blown up by the U.S. military, 131 of them (approximately 100,000 total tons) were transferred for use in repatriation and transportation.</p>
<p>(2) The "Nagato" and "Sake" battleships were used for atomic bomb testing at Bikini Atoll.</p>
<p>(3) Vessels that have already been destroyed by the U.S. military include: 3 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 5 cruisers, 1 destroyer, 50 submarines, 3 training ships, 2 target ships, and 6 minelayers, coastal defense ships, minesweepers, and submarine chasers.</p>
<p>(4) Currently unprocessed: 10 cruisers, 23 coastal defense ships, 24 submarine chasers, 13 patrol boats, 1 target ship, 2 transport ships, 3 minesweepers, and 6 number boats.</p>
<p>(5) Vessels that were still under construction and had not been completed before the surrender: a total of 104 vessels with a total displacement of 123,000 tons. Aircraft carriers (4 ships), coastal defense ships (2 ships), and submarines (34 ships) were completely dismantled. Destroyers (4 ships), coastal defense ships (18 ships), patrol boats (22 ships), transport ships (5 ships), minesweepers (1 ship), and target boats (1 ship) were converted into merchant ships. The total amount of scrap iron dismantled was 158,000 tons. Once the repatriation work is completed, all ships are expected to be dismantled within the year.</p>
<p>At the time of surrender, the Japanese army overseas, from Kuye Island in the north to the islands of the Dutch New Guinea in the south, including Japanese residents, totaled over 7,076,000. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of the Navy in September 1945, the army had 3,197,000 personnel, the navy had 455,000 personnel, and the total number of overseas residents was 3,422,000. According to a report from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the total number of overseas prisoners of war at that time was only 6,374,000. It is generally estimated that the total figures made by the former are more reliable. (See the table below)</p>
<p>Number of Japanese POWs and Overseas Residents in Various Regions Before Japan's Surrender (Statistics from the Ministry of the Navy, September 25, 1945)</p>
<p>The numbers of Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents were so large that surrender was not easy, and the work of repatriation and demobilization was even more arduous. Based on the content of the Potsdam Declaration, the Allied Headquarters established a repatriation team to smoothly handle the above-mentioned Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents and began the repatriation work. Transportation was handled by a new agency called SCAJAP. The means of transportation used by this agency were Japanese ships received by the United States and surplus ships from the United States itself. The crew was staffed by Japanese personnel, and the cost was borne by the Japanese government. All supervisory powers were in the hands of the United States. At the beginning of the surrender, the Japanese government had only 260,000 tons of merchant ships, and it was expected that the repatriation work would not be completed until May 1950. Later, because it was felt that there were not enough ships and the transportation work was too slow, the U.S. military allocated 105 Liberty ships (total tonnage of 350,000 tons) and 85 landing craft (total tonnage of 102,000 tons) in March 1945, plus 43 Japanese ships (total tonnage of 83,000 tons) and 131 Japanese naval warships (total tonnage of 108,000 tons), which greatly increased the transportation capacity and was of great help in promoting the demobilization of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The procedures for repatriating Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents are worth mentioning. The first step is to detain all Japanese soldiers and overseas residents from the surrendered country into concentration camps; then, they are escorted from the concentration camps to the port or wharf; next, they must undergo customs inspection to prevent smuggling of materials or weapons, and they must undergo disease inspection and be vaccinated before being allowed to board the ship; the fourth step is implemented on the ship: ask each soldier or overseas resident for their name, address, unit number, and the current situation of soldiers in the same unit, and inquire about the payment of military salaries; the fifth step is: after returning to Japan, the reception station will distribute clothing, give return train tickets or boat tickets, provide two days of food and small expenses for the journey (300 Japanese yen), and notify local relief agencies to distribute their unpaid military salaries.</p>
<p>The repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents proceeded smoothly, with an average of about 186,000 people being repatriated per week. By the end of last year, it was generally completed. As for those who were selectively retained in China, they were only technical personnel to meet the needs of the takeover work and current business, and their repatriation work will be considered when the time is right.</p>
<p>The work of repatriating Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents by the Soviet Union in Northeast China, North Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands has always been very slow. Since March of last year, a portion of Northeast China has been taken over by our army, and the first batch of repatriations began on May 13. By the end of May, a total of 63,500 people had been repatriated. As of early June, the number of Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents remaining in Northeast China was still as high as 1.9 million, including 1.6 million Japanese residents and 300,000 Japanese prisoners of war. The areas where they remained and their numbers are as follows: 500,000 in northern Manchuria, 400,000 in the Shenyang-Huludao area, 64,000 in the Shenyang-Dalian area, 269,000 in the Dalian city area, and 80,000 in the Andong city area, totaling 1,399,000. The whereabouts of another 500,000 people are still unknown. Of the 200,000 Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents originally in North Korea, some have successively fled to South Korea due to various reasons, and then repatriated to their home country by the U.S. military. It is said that there are still 14,000 Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents in the Kuril Islands and 300,000 people in Sakhalin Island. There are still 1.2 million Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents remaining in the Soviet-occupied areas who have not been repatriated. On December 19 of last year, the Allied Headquarters and the Soviet Army reached an agreement that the Soviet Army would repatriate 50,000 people per month. As for the 90,000 Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents remaining in the Dutch East Indies and British colonies (such as Malaya), the Allied Headquarters reported that they have been unable to repatriate them to this day purely due to ship issues.</p>
<p>One more thing worth mentioning is that the 1.2 million Allied residents who resided in Japan before the war have all successively boarded empty ships that repatriated Japanese prisoners of war and overseas residents and returned to their respective countries. In addition, there are currently over a thousand nationals and civilians of enemy countries and traitors (including those with German, British, American, Dutch, and Canadian citizenship) detained in Japan, who are being dealt with separately.</p>

<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao: I would like to request that you publish my letter to the Municipal Government and the Liang Renda Funeral Committee in your esteemed newspaper. Thank you very much. The letter is as follows:</p>
<p>To Mayor Wu Guozhen of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Honorable Members of the Liang Renda Funeral Committee:</p>
<p>With utmost respect, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the enthusiasm and generous donations of condolence money to the family members of my late brother, Renda, who was tragically murdered on February 9th, which has touched us deeply and brought some comfort to his soul. As Renda's elder brother, I would like to offer some humble suggestions regarding the future use of the donated funds, for your consideration and guidance. I would be most grateful.

<p>Literary Profiles of Chengdu in the Spring and Autumn Period Luo Yujun</p>
<p>A clear spring day is a rare sight in Chengdu. The chilling east wind, with its power to make people shiver and shrink, is no less fierce than the north wind. But spring has indeed arrived. Don't you believe it? The heat under the blanket at midnight, the clever chirping of birds on the branches at dawn, the gradually reviving flowers and plants in the courtyard—are these not signs of spring?</p>
<p>On February 2nd, we woke up early and hurriedly tidied ourselves because of the precious friendship that bound us together. None of us could forget Li Jieren, the host of Lingke, who had invited us for the day. We all came prepared with a sincere heart to listen to the sharp and insightful discussions and with a healthy appetite to enjoy the renowned delicacies.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, the car passed the Niushikou station, and beyond that was the eastward Yangguan Avenue. It's hard to believe, but after living in this ancient city for ten years, today is the first time I've been to the East Station. The dilapidated mud houses around the station, leaning precariously and unable to withstand the wind and rain, along with the station's own state of decay, truly shocked me. The poverty of the Chinese people is something that people in England and America cannot imagine. This vast and sorrowful nation can adapt and survive under any harsh and impoverished conditions. Who gives us this great power to survive? Only nature can understand.</p>
<p>The car stopped in the square of Shangshahe Fort. I was not allowed to continue staring blankly at the distant sky and the newly green wheat fields. The four of us got out of the car and headed towards the road to Lingjiao Yan. Xiaofang insisted on asking for directions as we walked, while Chen Xianghe firmly believed in his experience and memory and refused to ask anyone. Xianghe and Lin Ruji even had a heated argument. Fortunately, this is a democratic era, and everyone respected each other's opinions. Soon, we reached a fork in the road, and Ruji firmly stated that we should turn left. Because the road to the right led to a large orchard five miles away, where his youth and laughter were buried, and the road was imprinted with his sorrowful footsteps. After this sincere explanation, Xianghe's confidence wavered, and we all agreed to ask the farmers by the roadside to verify Ruji's judgment. The farmer replied very sincerely:</p>
<p>"Are you asking about Professor Li? The one who writes about Ba Jin? He lives in the orchard on the slope."</p>
<p>In order to divert Ruji's sad memories, I suddenly exclaimed: "What beautiful red soil! The red soil on the Yue Wang Temple path in West Lake cannot be so proud!" Xianghe also chimed in, saying: "This soil is most suitable for growing jasmine flowers." I said: "The fragrance of jasmine, gardenia, and ylang-ylang is too strong and vulgar. Only the fragrance of orchids is elegant." As soon as I said this, I suddenly remembered that Ruji's late wife was named Shuman, and I feared that the word "orchid" would lead to associations with "Cymbidium," and I felt a little embarrassed. Fortunately, the other group of guests arrived, diverting Ruji's attention. Lü Chaoxiang said: "Once, I heard Li Jieren's voice as soon as I got here." He inadvertently revealed his pen name, which meant "voice like a loud bell."</p>
<p>Lingke is not bordered by the bustling world, but it has a quiet wooden gate. On the horizontal beam is written "Better to Give Than to Receive." The couplet beside the door reads, "Through tribulations, the vast sea is easily overturned; in the depths of spring, the peach blossoms are hard to thank." They are all written on bright red paper, which shows the new atmosphere of the new year. At the same time, in the handwriting and tone, we can see the heroic spirit of the host of Lingke.</p>
<p>In front of the door is a field of cattails. Xiaofang said that in the early summer, when the breeze passes, the scene of "light silk skirts with new cattails" must be very poetic.</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the gate, without waiting for the host to politely offer us seats, none of us wanted to stay in the exquisite and bright living room. Everyone was greedily running around the garden, all trying to find something more novel and unknown. I ran from the front garden to the back garden, and the first thing that caught my attention was eight pots of blooming snow orchids and two lush lemon trees with green branches that never withered. They were metabolizing, contentedly blooming and bearing fruit. There were also three blooming cinnabar plum trees in the back garden, like beautifully dressed young women, both dignified and charming. After seeing all of this, I had a feeling that spring first visited Lingke before slowly and belatedly heading to the complex city.</p>
<p>Perhaps spring comes from the east. In Lingke, she had already opened her drowsy and charming eyes, but in the bustling city, she tiredly turned her weary head away. Otherwise, why do the plum blossoms in Lingke bloom first? Why do the leaves in Lingke fall later? I know that the countryside is nature's favorite, and Rousseau understood this best.</p>
<p>The host saw that we were a group of unruly guests, so he simply led us to climb the back mountain for a distant view. He stood on the top of an ancient tomb, gesturing and speaking, and our eyes followed his command. Over there is Zhang Fei Camp in Longquanyi, and over there are the Daxueshan and Xiaoxueshan mountains of Songli. Down there, at the foot of the mountains, lies the aging, vast ancient city. I followed those densely packed roofs that concealed the sins of the world, imagining that there was a river like a brocade belt among them, carrying the joys and sorrows of the city to the distance, disappearing into the hazy sea of memory.</p>
<p>Since the war, Mr. Li Jieren has been living in Lingke and has become so fond of it that he doesn't want to leave. Looking at the layout of his garden and the renovation of his house, it seems as if he has planned for a hundred years. I understand that he wants to defend the Lingke position in order to maintain his physical and mental well-being and to devote himself to writing. Just like Gide in Paris, who always wants to live on the seventh floor to maintain his physical and mental well-being. I had this feeling when I first arrived at Lingke.</p>
<p>It was half past two in the afternoon, and Liu Shengya and Chen Weimo had not yet arrived. Our stomachs were rumbling in protest. Fortunately, Miss Yuanshan brought out two plates of snacks, and everyone devoured them ravenously, revealing the exquisite antique porcelain plate bottoms in an instant. At three o'clock, Shengya and Weimo finally arrived leisurely. Everyone's hearts were filled with the joy of friendship. They came by pedicab, having mistakenly believed the driver's words and gone around in circles in Lingjiao Yan. In the end, they had to get out of the car and rely on their own feet to reach their destination. Being carried is not as good as walking on your own two feet, and being helped up is not as good as standing on your own. Life teaches us lessons everywhere.</p>
<p>Lunch consisted of four cold dishes and five hot dishes, including cold noodles, Russian cuisine, fried fish, egg rolls, abalone, winter bamboo shoots, crab roe, silver belly, and pig brains. Who says that art is a product of being well-fed? In my state of hunger, I was careful not to neglect the slow chewing and appreciation. Xianghe, who sat next to me, liked "color" but not "food." He had written a small book about growing flowers, so I called him a lecher. He once said: "If I were to invite guests, I would just stew a big pot of meat. Why bother with all the small dishes that take up so much time and space? In the end, it's all swallowed in one gulp." I didn't agree with his theory and had a debate with him. I think that cooking is a product of culture, and the combination of beautiful dishes with good color, aroma, and taste is like a complete poem or a segment of an ideal life, yearning for the source of life. Because the experience of human tastes has created cooking, and it is this experienced hand that has written the cultural history of mankind. Anatole France said: "In the library of the future, I will not read any cultural history or scientific history. I will only read a fashionable magazine to examine the women's clothing of a certain century. The clothing of these women will show me more about the humanistic spirit of the era than all the philosophers, novelists, prophets, and scientists." I am now imitating France's words and boldly saying: cooking is cultural history.</p>
<p>After lunch, we each drank a cup of strong coffee, and in accordance with the drunken and flushed mood, we ran to the garden again. Shengya suggested that I go to see the well, and I was reminded of Mr. Su Dongpo's homesickness, "Clearly, I dream of falling into my hometown." I said that everyone is nostalgic for their hometown, probably because of the water and soil. Wang Bingyang said that hometown is the countryside, and Mongolians commonly refer to a certain well as a certain yurt. For example, "the people of the marketplace." At this time, Ruji suddenly pointed to a pile of miscanthus stalks by the well and shouted: "SY, your stable is here!"</p>
<p>Ruji's bizarre interlude made everyone laugh. Because Ruji is a master of historical allusions, he often touches on inspiration and connects cause and effect, making people unable not to laugh. Just now at the banquet, Shengya (i.e., SY) boasted about his "Spring Festival Horse Race," but in reality, he is the youngest among us. Ruji meant to mock him for riding a hobbyhorse at a young age.</p>
<p>Later, Xianghe proposed: "Recently, a private literary group has invited us to give public lectures with ticket sales. What if someone in the future scolds the lecturers for using this as a means of raising money? The people who have been invited are all here now, so let's make a resolution." At this time, Li Jieren, with the majestic posture of a tiger, walked in the center of the living room, saying as he walked: "Since we have agreed, we cannot break our promise to the young people. We have a clear conscience, having not accepted a penny in compensation, so let people scold us." After a while, he continued: "The best way to stop slander is to cultivate oneself. I will go my own way."</p>
<p>At this time, the setting sun slanted into the living room from the wide corridor, and the whole room was filled with noble golden waves. The victorious clear sky seemed to be applauding us.</p>
<p>About Wang Tingshao Zizhen</p>
<p>The extant collections of folk songs from the Qing Dynasty known today include Zhang Zixu's "A Carefully Selected Collection of Popular Hua Diao Taiping Songs," the anonymous "Myriad Flowers Little Songs," "A Collection of Qing Sounds," "A Combined Collection of Western Tunes and Yellow Flowers," Wang Tingshao's "Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music," an anonymous "Little Songs for Silk String Instruments," Hua Guang's "Legacy of White Snow," and the anonymous "Combined Collection of Chang Cha and Cui Cha," among seven or eight others. Among them, "Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music" is the most well-known because it has a xylographic print, and "Legacy of White Snow" has a selected edition. However, the editors of these two books are still unknown to this day. Hua Guang is likely a person whose name is not known outside of Min, and it seems difficult to find historical materials about him. However, Wang Tingshao was relatively wealthy.</p>
<p>The preface to "Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music" by Wang himself does not reveal much about his life, only that he was a scholar. However, the preface by Sheng An states: "Mr. possesses the talent of carving dragons and embroidering tigers, and his writings are prolific. In addition to essays for the imperial examinations and poems, he occasionally indulges in leisurely emotions, composing elegant songs that are lingering and melancholic, following in the footsteps of those in the Flower Garden School." He must have been a somewhat well-known figure. Although a detailed history has not yet been seen, the following scattered historical materials can give a glimpse of Wang's life.</p>
<p>A more detailed record is found in Bao Guixing's "Manuscripts of Nostalgic Poems by Maosheng" (old xylographic edition, volume 1), volume 2:</p>
<p>"Wang Kaitang, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, whose given name was Tingshao, was a native of Daxing. He was reassigned as a Principal Secretary after being a Shujishi, and remained in the Ministry of Justice for twenty years. He twice participated in the literary selection for the Ministry of Rites, and Chen Sanyuan (Jichang) was a student of his. He died at the age of fifty-eight as a Yuanwailang. He was poor but proud, looking down on everything. His voice was loud and clear, surprising those around him wherever he went. His poetry was influenced by Du Fu, profound and heartfelt. He was quick-witted and talented in many arts. He planted flowers and bamboo in his small room; he sang songs and drank wine, enjoying himself freely. He was one year older than me, and we both passed the provincial and metropolitan examinations together. After I retired from office, he visited me even more frequently. He struggled to have an heir, so he adopted his nephew Xiaolian's (Rubi) son as his own. He passed away suddenly when his adopted son was only four years old, and both his adopted grandson and orphaned daughter died young. It is difficult to bear the pain!" His poem also says:</p>
<p>"He served in the Hanlin Academy for three years and as a teacher for twenty years. His students include Cai Wenji, and his disciples include Peng Xuan. He no longer discusses military affairs, and who will pass on his bitter verses? My old friend's head is like a heap of dirt, and I mourn him deeply by the wine jar."</p>
<p>Bao's "Nostalgic Poems" do not mention his year of birth, so Wang's birth and death dates cannot be calculated. It is only known that Bao was a Juren in the Qianlong year of Renzi (the fifty-seventh year) and a Jinshi in the Jiaqing year of Jiwei (the fourth year). Wang also passed the provincial and metropolitan examinations with him in the same years of Renzi and Jiwei. Ji Yun also served as his teacher, so volume six of the "Shenyang Continued Records" mentions "Wang Tingshao, a student of Ji Yun."</p>
<p>Liang Zhangju also recorded two trivial matters about him in "Continued Notes on Antithetical Couplets." One is found in volume three: "Wang Kaitang, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice (Tingshao), a native of Beizhili, repeatedly participated in the spring and autumn literary selections and obtained many excellent scholars from the southern provinces. Chen Lianshi, the top scholar in all three levels of the imperial examinations, was one of his students." Another is found in volume four: "Wang Kaitang grew old in the Ministry of Justice and was very poor. His house had a horse stable next to it, and the door faced the main road. He wrote a couplet himself and hung it on the doorpost, saying: 'The horse bones are thin, but they eat not only noodles but also grass; the sound of the cart is rumbling, pulling people and horses but not pulling money.' Those who see it cannot help but smile."</p>
<p>Based on the above documents, his life story is: his name was Tingshao, his courtesy name was Kaitang, and he was from Daxing in Zhili ("The preface to 'Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music' is entitled Moling"). He was a Juren in the Qianlong year of Renzi (the fifty-seventh year) and a Jinshi in the Jiaqing year of Jiwei (the fourth year). He was reassigned from Shujishi to a Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Justice and ended his career as a Yuanwailang after ten years, at the age of fifty-eight. He was poor, proud, and fond of poetry.</p>
<p>The preface to "Sequel to the Rainbow Skirt Music" states that the songs sung by the musical troupes in the capital were mostly passed down orally and gradually faded into obscurity. Yan, a song master from the Sanhe Hall, fearing their loss, collected them and had them engraved. "Because there were many errors, he asked me to correct them... Although I reluctantly obeyed the orders of my friends, I did not correct the mistakes, and I certainly did not revise the vulgar and absurd passages. After the title was woven, I felt very uneasy. However, the lyrics were made by them, and I cannot add to my beauty, nor can I add to my ugliness." Judging from this, he only corrected the typos, but did not get involved in the editing or revision. He was actually an editor in name only, probably because the song master wanted to use Wang's name to add weight to himself. The actual editor of this book should be Song Master Yan from the Sanli Hall. According to the "Miscellaneous Operas in Celebration of Longevity" attached at the end of the book, there is a poem by Yan, signed "Yan Zide from Tianjin, a lyricist." All that is known about him is his surname and address; nothing else can be verified.</p>
<p>De Nake River Keke Xiuka</p>
<p>Oskar Kokoschka (1886-) is an outstanding German modern painter and a particularly novel figure in modern novel painting styles. In his oil paintings, whether figures or landscapes, he likes to use primary colors. When he is in high spirits, he often squeezes the color bottle directly onto the canvas without having to use a brush to mix other colors. The thickness of the color exceeds that of Gokh, a late impressionist, so some people call him the "Nordic Gokh." However, his achievements are much worse than Gokh's. This work is representative of him, but unfortunately, single-color printing cannot show its advantages. (Lion)</p>
<p>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 314 Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"After arriving at the Cathay Hotel?"</p>
<p>"After arriving at the Cathay Hotel," the fellow's dumb face suddenly showed a strange smile, "Miss first allowed and condoled and waited on the left, Miss measured the height and breadth of the house, once just about to step into the hall, two young men and women walked out of the main entrance of the hotel hall..."</p>
<p>"Hmm...?" He Jian expressed surprise; he seemed to ask the rickshaw puller to explain more clearly.</p>
<p>"...One young man and one young woman." At this point, the rickshaw puller tightly closed his dumb mouth, bowed twice to Yun Tong. This was a courtesy brought about by He Jian's "hmm." He bowed again and again, expressing that he could not speak clearly and had to apologize.</p>
<p>"Go on!" He Jian was listening attentively, and he was a little angry to see the rickshaw puller suddenly shut up.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes, ... One young man and one young woman, the young man is wearing a military uniform of the Great Japanese Army, his expression is flying and his spirit is energetic. ... The young woman is wearing a uniform of the Great Japanese students, the spirit of her beautiful face is shining like the cherry blossoms in March and the chrysanthemums in September, adding a few smiles, with the posture of a first-class beauty..."</p>
<p>Before being a rickshaw puller, this fellow was probably not a poet, but a writer. He Jian and Zheng Yan were amused and couldn't help laughing when they heard these pretentious words, even though they were full of thoughts. Seeing that the expressions of the two people were somewhat happy, thinking</p>
<h3>British Ministry of Food Comes to China to Purchase, Egg Exports Gradually See a Turnaround, Major Loss Due to Carelessness at Maochang Warehouse, but No Impact on Order Contracts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, regarding the matter of our country's egg exports, a reporter visited Mr. Zheng Yuan, the General Manager of Maochang Company in this city, to inquire about the detailed process. He graciously provided detailed answers, and the main points are recorded as follows: He stated: The egg products exported from our country are divided into three types: 1. Frozen Eggs: The British Ministry of Food intends to order 9,000 tons from our country at a price of £200 per ton, which will be undertaken by the Frozen Egg Industry Association. Due to cost concerns, the association repeatedly requested the Export Promotion Committee to transfer the matter to the Central Trust Bureau for assistance, earnestly requesting that the bureau be responsible for purchasing. The responsibility for manufacturing and sales would then rest with the Frozen Egg Industry Association. As a result, the Frozen Egg Industry Association and the Central Trust Bureau signed a contract on the 4th of this month to manufacture 5,000 tons of frozen eggs, priced at 9 million legal currency per ton, to be paid in five installments. The first installment was completed on the 7th of this month, and subsequent installments will be processed accordingly. Currently, members of the Frozen Egg Industry Association are planning to purchase fresh eggs and arrange commencement matters. 2. Dried Whole Egg Powder: The quantity is 250 tons, priced at £720 per ton, currently under negotiation, with the same procedure as above. 3. Dried Egg White: 100 tons, Egg Yolk: 400 tons, currently, the Far East Egg Products Manufacturing Joint Company is jointly requesting the Export Promotion Committee to transfer the matter to the Central Trust Bureau for assistance, and a decision is expected soon. The British Ministry of Food also intends to purchase all three types of egg products listed above.</p>
<p>Stable Egg Prices</p>
<p>As for current egg prices, he believes they are still relatively stable and unlikely to undergo any changes. He only hopes that rice prices and other commodity prices can also remain stable. This time, the company's rented warehouse on Nanxun Road suffered a loss due to carelessness. According to Mr. Zheng's post-incident investigation, the estimated loss is 12,831 fresh eggs. However, he stated that this loss has no impact on egg prices, because the lost eggs were purchased by the company before the Frozen Egg Industry Association and the Central Trust Bureau signed the contract, and were intended as extra preparation. Therefore, the loss suffered was part of that extra preparation. However, the above incident has no impact on the order contract signed with the Central Trust Bureau, nor on the quantity of egg products manufactured by the company. This is because the company began preparing to resume work on the 20th of last month and officially started work on the 5th of this month. Although it unfortunately encountered a disaster on the night of the 8th, resulting in the total destruction of the egg sorting room and the egg stacking room, our company can find a way to restore the spaces originally intended for refrigeration and egg sorting, but currently used as ordinary passenger and freight warehouses, to their original state for use as egg sorting and stacking rooms. As for other egg production sites within the factory, there was no damage. Therefore, our company will be able to resume work soon, and there will be no problem with the quantity of eggs produced.</p>
<p>Estimated Losses</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zheng's investigation: The company's fire loss this time is estimated to be 2.4 billion national currency for fresh eggs, 890 million national currency for packaging materials, and 2 billion national currency for buildings and equipment. However, the fresh eggs and packaging materials were insured with British Tai Koo Company for £60,000. There is no problem with compensation. The buildings and equipment were not insured. Mr. Zheng stated that in addition to the cold storage warehousing business being conducted as usual, the ordinary warehousing aspect of the company will gradually cease operations starting today. All ordinary passenger and freight goods stored will be urged to be cleared. Even for rented parts, we intend to negotiate with tenants to vacate and take them back for our own use to avoid further complications, he said.</p>
<h3>Although the Market Suffered Interference, Chinese Stocks' Underlying Strength Still Shines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, major Chinese stock holders showed even more intention to increase their long positions, and continued to thrive. External interference promoted counteraction. However, because the black market prices of various kinds had no decrease, the assistance from foreign stocks and purchasing often rebounded after the fall. When the market opened in the morning, it was reported that Commander Xuan had sent an official letter to the mayor, which stated that attention should be paid to the stock market, resulting in lower market prices. After opening, Deyong Yarn, from numbers 85, 226, and 180, was sold to 3180 yuan. Numbers 106, 76, 4, 198, 185, 78, 153, 145, 171, 199, 167, and 224 all advanced. New Asia, China Silk, and Qinxing successively reached their daily limit increases. Deyong Yarn gradually increased to 33370 yuan. Numbers 36, 117, 177, 99, and 231 were sold at higher prices and slightly stabilized. Afterwards, sudden external interference caused widespread panic. Numbers 97, 196, 156, 12, 105, 133, 76, 232, and 85 competed to sell. After 10:30, adversity suddenly arose, and in an instant, prices fell by more than 200 yuan, to 3130 yuan. Numbers 205, 218, and 177 took advantage of the low price to enter at 3250 yuan. Numbers 99, 47, and 198 sold again, but it was still difficult to support. Numbers 235, 190, 4, and 207 sold at 310 yuan. Numbers 218, 47, 61, 198, 76, 107, 105, 8, 2, and 11 rushed to buy, and prices rose again to 3210 yuan. Police authorities sent personnel to the market to investigate, and everyone hoped for a quick resolution. Numbers 28, 207, and 223 all exited. Numbers 218 and 97 entered and then exited. Before closing, prices returned to around 3110 yuan. After closing, quoted prices rose slightly. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Qinxing rose by half a percent, Xinguang and Xinhua were flat, and Huafeng rose slightly due to the addition of six new approvals and three additional issuances of information. Deyong Yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, and Zhongfa each fell by about half a percent. In deferred transactions, Deyong Yarn, Xinhe, and Meiya fell by half a percent, Xinguang was flat, and Huafeng rose slightly. Cold stocks Yonggong fell by slightly less than 10 percent, Datong, Tongyi, and Match each fell by 0.5 percent, China Silk and New Asia reached their daily limit increases, and the rest were flat.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, numbers 203, 185, 85, and 218 all entered, and Deyong Yarn rose to 3210 yuan. New Asia and China Silk still reached their daily limit increases.

Major players such as Chengde, Room 512, and Room 360 made additions, while Room 550 and Room 501 exited.

<h3>Cotton Cloth Full of Vitality, Sentiment Firm, Quoted Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was that because textile construction opened with limited chips, sentiment was smooth and firm, the market atmosphere was vigorous, and quoted prices continued to rise. The fine cloth market outside the market was not weak, and it was heard that the Tianjin gang was constantly searching for raw color goods and white plain fine cloth. Longtou fine cloth was again quoted as high as 193,000 to 194,000 yuan, Wufu 185,000 yuan, and other brands also followed up by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

The factory of high-end goods for Shilin cloth increased costs, so the market situation was also firm.</p>
<h3>Rayon Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for 120-count rayon, Gaoshan, opened at 8.1 million yuan. Because it was known that 2,500 boxes had arrived at the port, sentiment was unusually weak, and prices spiraled downwards, with the lowest quoted price being 7.9 million yuan. Later, rumors spread that there would be no distribution this week, and the market rebounded, finally selling at 8.15 million yuan. As a result, it was even with the previous day. The factory agent's market yesterday was very light, and quoted prices were similar to the previous day. D-grade retail had transactions at 8.5 million yuan. The Qianjing business was rarely open, silk goods and quilt covers went well at 50,000 yuan, and Dacheng Gebi opened at 8.5 million to 8 million yuan. There was no shortage of people taking advantage of the low prices, so the quoted prices slowly rose, and the final traded price was 9.3 million yuan for single orders. There was little change in the rayon goods market yesterday.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops Shorten Business Hours</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued new business regulations for the silver shop industry, the industry has complied with the ministry's orders and resumed business. However, because sales are high and deposits are low, it is difficult to sustain. According to the person in charge of the Silver Shop Industry Association of this city, there are rumors that the silver shop industry will go to Beijing again to petition. The silver shop industry currently has no such plan. However, in order to maintain the future of the business, the only option is to shorten business hours. Currently, silver shops in this city open at 10:00 am and close at 4:00 pm every day, and only sell enough to offset the day's outflow, and are unwilling to sell more, he said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Allocation Warehouse Receipts Limited to Delivery, Overdue Purchase at Original Price, City Government Authorities Agree with This Measure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the past, in order to avoid the Taiwan Sugar Company's allocated sugar from flowing into the market for speculative buying and selling, it was stipulated that the company's sugar allocation warehouse receipts must be delivered within ten days. Now, the company has found that there are still a few warehouse receipts for the 11th, 12th, and 13th sugar allocations that have not been delivered. The company specially announced a public notice yesterday, and at the same time, issued a written notice to the City Sugar Merchants Association, to notify its members, stating: All sugar allocation warehouse receipts of the company before the 13th allocation of this year must be processed for delivery before the 20th of this month. If overdue, the company will purchase the sugar at the original price. It is heard that the city government authorities strongly agree with the company's action.</p>
<h3>Resuming Sugar Distribution Based on Population, Deliberating Distribution Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Price Evaluation Council decided to resume the sugar distribution method based on population in this city, it is heard that the distribution method is still being deliberated by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. It is understood that the general situation will be similar to the sugar distribution method in October of last year. The sugar to be distributed is Taiwan Sugar Company's No. 1 granulated sugar, and the distribution price is still 170,000 yuan per dan. If you add the legal profit of the distribution merchant, as well as packaging fees and shipping costs, the distribution price per catty is approximately between 2,100 and 2,200 yuan. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is currently negotiating with sugar merchants to undertake the distribution, or will mainly use the Southern Goods Industry and the city's consumer cooperatives. Detailed distribution methods are expected to be announced in one or two days. As for Taiwan Sugar Company's sugar allocation to sugar merchants, it will be temporarily suspended this week, and the methods for next week have not yet been decided, it is said.</p>

<h3>Industrial Oils Rise</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Coconut oil soap factories and soap factories are searching everywhere, and the market supply has become scarce again, making procurement extremely difficult. Yesterday, there was only a small amount of trading in the market, with a price of 510,000 to 520,000 yuan per dan. Those who hold the goods neither quote prices nor release the stock, the source has long been cut off, and they are treating it as a rare commodity. Butter is also following the upward trend, with the price of high-quality goods reaching the edge of 500,000. Asphalt arrivals are very rare, and inventory is also low.

<p>Sales of high-end goods such as Kaiping No. 1 coal fines, No. 2 fines, and Fuxin fines all slightly moved, but transaction prices were not high. The trend of coal lumps continued to weaken, and the price ratio with coal fines gradually approached. High-end goods in white coal lumps were the same as before. There were still many arrivals of small-mine white coal lumps, Shantou Meiyuan lumps, and Hankou Laolong lumps, but because of the mixed quality and intermittent arrivals, promotion was quite difficult, so the transaction price ratio was lower than the former, approximately between 900,000 yuan and 1.3 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Few Foreign Sales of Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign merchants' tea market, because the voices of selling were still very loud, and the appetite of buyers became more sluggish, sentiment was tired, and trading continued to be weak throughout the day, and the market showed a declining trend again. As for domestic sales of colored tea, Wenzhou Xinlongjing was crowned with new arrivals, and the situation has not improved. If other types of old tea lack the strength of supply and demand, the market will fluctuate less.</p>
